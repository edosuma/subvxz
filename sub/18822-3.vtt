00:12.040 --> 00:16.070
'You're listening to the
Nightfly on Radio Carillon.

00:16.120 --> 00:19.790
Broadcasting sounds that
soothe, cheer and comfort

00:19.840 --> 00:23.150
the patients and staff
here at Cowley General.'

00:23.200 --> 00:26.990
And now, with the time just
coming up to 11 o'clock,

00:27.040 --> 00:31.120
this is your friend
Hester Fagen signing off.

01:08.920 --> 01:10.520
That's it.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.600
One pair of men's
spectacles. Tortoise shell.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.160
17 shillings and ninepence ha'penny.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.990
There you go, then, Mr Greely.
You just rest up there a bit.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.640
Bit of company for you there, look.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.790
- Morse.
- Morning, sir.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.510
I won't be a minute.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.110
- Much in?
- There's a sudden in Northway.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.110
- Uniform want us to give it
a quick once-over. - Right.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.320
Well, drop me at the
station on your way there.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.910
Off, then!

03:56.960 --> 03:58.280
Win?

04:00.120 --> 04:02.070
Cheer-oh.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.390
Right.

04:04.440 --> 04:06.320
No sandwiches?

04:07.520 --> 04:08.670
No.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.120
No, not today. After you, then.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.790
Put her away, I'm going to visit
Mr Bryce-Morgan in the hospital.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.040
Whoa!

04:17.160 --> 04:19.430
- Will do.
- There you go.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.550
Good morning, gentlemen.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.070
- Good morning, Sir Merlyn.
- Morning, Sir Merlyn.

04:48.120 --> 04:52.020
- Now, how about that gastrectomy?
- Healing nicely, sir.

04:52.120 --> 04:55.800
Dr Powell. If you can
bear to tear yourself away.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.660
- Morning, Sister.
- Morning, Sir Merlyn.

05:04.360 --> 05:07.100
- Everything ready?
- All ready, sir.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.800
- See you in the morning.
- Thank you, Sir Merlyn.

05:14.720 --> 05:17.150
Now then, my good man,
how are you feeling today?

05:17.200 --> 05:18.630
Fine, thank you, Sir Merlyn.

05:18.680 --> 05:23.030
Mr Talbot was taken at the fall of Singapore
and set to work on the Burma Railway.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.710
Once a year, he sheds the
lining of his stomach.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.160
Still. We're "all friends now", eh?

05:30.480 --> 05:33.830
- Bed 10. Where's Mr Greely?
- He died, sir, in the night.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.270
I saw him yesterday.
He was well on the mend.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.420
- He was quite elderly, sir.
- He was my age.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.510
Straight-forward pulmonary
lobectomy, wasn't it?

05:43.560 --> 05:45.310
I want a full postmortem.

05:45.360 --> 05:48.440
I believe the body's already
been collected by the undertaker.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.280
How many's that? It won't do, Powell.

06:39.080 --> 06:41.030
Mrs Ethel Zacharides.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.430
Sixties.

06:42.480 --> 06:43.870
Dead about three days.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.430
Evil old cow! Evil old cow!

06:47.480 --> 06:50.350
Rather a limited repertoire, I'm afraid.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.390
Answers to the name of Jeremiah.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.870
Natural causes?

06:56.880 --> 06:58.470
No obvious signs of violence.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.230
Heart, possibly.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.950
Apoplexy.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.910
Could be any of the thousand shocks.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.830
But nothing suspicious?

07:05.880 --> 07:10.630
Not at first glance -- from a
medical point of view at least.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.350
- The rest I leave to you.
- What about this?

07:14.400 --> 07:16.640
Knocked off the dresser.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.880
A seizure, possibly.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.030
Zacharides.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.230
Rings a distant tocsin.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.380
It'll come to me. Nothing
important probably.

07:33.280 --> 07:34.820
Vale vigile!

07:49.120 --> 07:52.710
- That's it. All secure.
- 'Terence Bakewell, sir.'

07:52.760 --> 07:57.280
Being transferred from Farnleigh
Prison to Cowley General this morning.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.040
Sir?

08:03.240 --> 08:07.030
Is this your erm... informant?

08:07.080 --> 08:08.390
Yes, sir.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.720
The peterman on the
Robson's jeweller's job.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.350
'If you recall, Mrs Robson
was very badly injured.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.110
Never walk again, leastways.'

08:17.160 --> 08:21.830
Division said something about a
round-the-clock armed guard at the hospital.

08:21.880 --> 08:26.430
Yes, sir. Bakewell's agreed
to turn Queen's Evidence

08:26.480 --> 08:29.150
against those members of the
Matthews Gang still at large.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.070
You think they'll try to get to him?

08:31.120 --> 08:34.799
It's the Matthews Gang,
sir, what's left of it.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.670
Anything from the neighbours?

08:45.720 --> 08:50.150
Mrs Zacharides had lived here for 20
years. Her husband died six months ago.

08:50.200 --> 08:54.040
She has a daughter in town, but they're
not on speaking terms, apparently.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.310
We'll need someone for that.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.590
- What's this?
- That sudden up in Northway.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.350
Local RSPCA officer's
laid up with the flu.

09:06.400 --> 09:07.790
They asked us to keep an eye.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.510
It can't stop here.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.910
It's a nick, not a bloody
pet shop. Put it in yours.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.550
Anything?

09:13.600 --> 09:15.470
Natural causes, according to Dr DeBryn.

09:15.520 --> 09:19.110
But she had two side plates out
and Mrs Zacharides lived alone.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.750
- Think she had someone with her?
- Or was expecting someone.

09:21.800 --> 09:24.430
Her writing desk had been
disturbed. Papers strewn about.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.750
That don't mean much. You
should see my nan's place.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.540
The rest of the place was tidy enough.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.910
Evil old cow!

09:31.960 --> 09:35.110
Happy marriage she had, was it?
Look after it for now, Sergeant.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.460
I need Morse to guard
Bakewell at Cowley General.

09:43.520 --> 09:46.190
Is there something you wanted?

09:46.740 --> 09:48.880
Mr... Mr Bakewell, is it?

09:49.840 --> 09:52.150
Hospital Library. What can I tempt you to?

09:52.200 --> 09:55.320
The Great Escape, if you've got it.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.400
No, I don't think so.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.780
- Who's that, then?
- Never you mind.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.870
Your temperature's gone up.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.910
Always does when you take it, Staff.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.100
Honestly, Mr Talbot!

10:17.920 --> 10:20.390
You really think they'd try
for Bakewell in hospital?

10:20.440 --> 10:22.310
It's the last dregs of the Matthews Gang.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.030
He's all that stands between
them and a long spell inside.

10:25.080 --> 10:28.160
I'll get Mr Bright to sign you a
chitty. Meet me in the armoury.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.430
Morse!

10:39.800 --> 10:42.540
Can you hear me, sir? Can you hear me?

10:42.960 --> 10:45.310
- 'Switchboard.'
- I need an ambulance at once.

10:45.360 --> 10:46.990
- 'To where?'
- Mr Bright's office.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.790
- 'Right.'
- Yeah, as soon as you can.

10:48.840 --> 10:52.430
There we are, sir. Don't worry,
sir, you're gonna be all right.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.550
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Get him straight in.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.540
Straight to surgery.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.630
Can you hear me, sir? Superintendent?

11:00.680 --> 11:02.750
- Thank you, miss. You got him?
- Yeah.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.910
- Quick as you can.
- Into prep. - Thank you.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.700
Sorry, sir, you'll have to wait here.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.160
Swab.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.900
- Swab, I said.
- Sorry, Sir Melvyn.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.470
I heard.

11:43.520 --> 11:46.070
Well, he's in good hands.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.190
The cutter's Sir Merlyn Chubb.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.470
Chief Surgeon. Do you
want me to see what's what?

11:50.520 --> 11:53.510
- Could you? - Course, old
fellow. Try not to worry.

11:53.560 --> 11:56.150
Oh, mystery solved, by the way.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.030
Mrs Zacharides.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.430
Her husband.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.830
I performed his postmortem
about six months ago.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.510
- He was a patient here?
- Don't panic.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.960
He wasn't one of Sir Merlyn's.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.180
- What did they say?
- Next 24 hours should tell.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.510
Right, Bakewell. This is
Detective Constable Morse.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.440
He's one of the officers who'll be keeping
an eye on you, so don't give him any trouble.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.430
Have you talked to Mrs
Zacharides' daughter yet?

12:49.480 --> 12:50.710
No, not yet.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.630
She rang, works at Beaufort.
I'll hold on here.

12:53.680 --> 12:55.480
Officer. Officer.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.990
If you ever... Come here. Come here.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.670
If you ever want to get him back
in chokey, stick him in another bed.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.390
- How's that?
- Bed Ten. It's unlucky.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.310
Five weeks I've been here, and
I've seen three go in that bed.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.990
Latest went just last night.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.310
That's quite enough, thank you, Mr Talbot.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.870
We don't want the other patients
troubled with your nonsense, do we?

13:27.920 --> 13:30.460
- No, Sister.
- Very well, then.

13:31.480 --> 13:32.670
Officer.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.230
- Sister MacMahon.
- Detective Constable Morse.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.550
You're one of the officers who'll
be looking after Mr Bakewell, is it?

13:38.600 --> 13:39.750
Mm-hm.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.990
I can't say I'm pleased
to have him with us.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.710
Police presence on the ward, indeed.

13:45.280 --> 13:47.680
Anything in it? Bed Ten?

13:48.680 --> 13:50.790
Well, there's no great mystery.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.430
We always put our most
poorly patients there.

13:53.480 --> 13:57.070
And should nature take its course,
we can deal with that eventuality

13:57.120 --> 13:59.860
without alarming the rest of the ward.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.640
Caroline?

14:05.480 --> 14:06.800
Morse?

14:07.840 --> 14:12.870
- What's the prognosis?
- Merlyn's done all he can.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.460
But Edgar's had a very bad stroke.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.790
I'm sorry.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.230
- You're still at er... Byers Hall?
- What a memory you have.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.470
Hm. Well, for some things.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.110
You were there often enough, I suppose.

14:28.160 --> 14:32.310
- Is William still at home?
- No.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.300
He's visiting Susan.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.320
And Henry, of course.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.870
Of course.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.270
Henry's at New Carthage now.

14:43.320 --> 14:46.150
Head of the Law Faculty.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.110
The youngest they've ever had.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.700
Yes, I read something about that.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.150
He's done very well for himself.

14:54.920 --> 14:59.440
And you, Morse? What
have you accomplished?

15:01.360 --> 15:04.360
Not so much, I don't
suppose, by comparison.

15:06.320 --> 15:11.350
Well, if you need any assistance,
then I'd certainly like to help.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.670
Here's my card. My home
number's on the back.

15:14.720 --> 15:16.670
Well, I'm sure that won't be necessary.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.320
Well, if you can think of anything.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.920
A policeman?

15:26.120 --> 15:27.760
A detective.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.550
Miss Zacharides? I'm Detective
Constable Morse, City Police.

15:47.600 --> 15:51.230
You spoke to a Sergeant Strange
this morning about your mother.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.750
Yeah. I got a letter from her last week.

15:53.800 --> 15:58.040
She'd been in dispute with the
hospital, where my dad died.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.350
Some of his things
weren't returned to him,

16:01.400 --> 16:02.950
that he had with him when he went in.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.750
Such as?

16:05.800 --> 16:07.910
She got his wedding ring back.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.630
But there was a little
bit of money went missing,

16:10.680 --> 16:13.960
and he had a diamond tie pin
that belonged to his father.

16:15.240 --> 16:18.950
Hospital denied it, of course,
said she must have been mistaken.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.940
Could she have been?

16:21.720 --> 16:24.870
Any case, she said someone from
the hospital had written to say

16:24.920 --> 16:26.990
they'd be coming by on
Friday to discuss it.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.040
On Friday?

16:30.800 --> 16:33.310
- Did she say who was
coming to see her? - No.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.880
- And what ward was your father on?
- Fosdick Ward.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.840
- Fosdick?
- That's right. Bed Ten.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.430
Right.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.070
This is where you are, sir.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.400
Division have asked me to cover
for Mr Bright for the time being.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.230
- That's good.
- Is it?

16:56.280 --> 16:59.110
What do I know about flying a desk?

16:59.160 --> 17:02.910
- Any word?
- Perforated peptic ulcer.

17:02.960 --> 17:06.109
The operation's gone as
well as could be hoped for.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.430
And Bakewell?

17:07.480 --> 17:10.069
They've put him on Fosdick
ward, same as Mr Bright.

17:10.119 --> 17:12.710
He's putting a brave face on
it but I'd say he's rattled.

17:12.760 --> 17:13.950
He should be.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.670
Heavy mob wouldn't really try and knock
him off, would they? Not in the hospital.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.260
I wouldn't put anything past 'em.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.869
Right.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.380
Chief Superin...

17:32.720 --> 17:36.150
Chief Superintendent Bright's
office, DI Thursday speaking.

17:36.200 --> 17:38.790
'Here then is a very special request

17:38.840 --> 17:42.270
for a certain someone on Fosdick Ward.'

17:42.320 --> 17:45.950
'Mr Bakewell? He's been as good as gold.'

17:46.000 --> 17:49.670
'If you see anyone unusual on the
ward, be sure to let us know.'

17:49.720 --> 17:51.120
Will do.

17:53.320 --> 17:56.070
What are they like, the staff on Fosdick?

17:56.120 --> 17:59.270
'Well, Sister Clodagh's a bit of a tartar.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.590
Sister MacMahon, that is.'

18:01.640 --> 18:04.190
You wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of her.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.190
'Sir Merlyn -- a great man.

18:06.240 --> 18:09.760
All the doctors quake in their
boots when he's on his rounds.'

18:11.000 --> 18:14.030
What about the rest of them?

18:14.080 --> 18:16.960
Well, then, there's Nurse Byron -- Flora.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.270
'She's very nice.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.190
Always makes you a cup of tea if you ask.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.110
Nurse Mills -- Jo-Beth.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.910
Well, the place would
fall apart without her.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.960
She tends to look after
the younger nurses.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.800
Little Student Nurse Daisy Bennett.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.440
She's very keen.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.560
But she does tend to get
in the most awful scrapes.

18:44.920 --> 18:48.160
Course, most of them are
potty about Dr Powell.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.640
Except for Sister Clodagh, of
course. She's married to the job.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.900
I think she may have
been engaged once, but...

19:00.960 --> 19:05.470
.. I suppose everyone's got their
own secret sadness, haven't they?'

19:05.520 --> 19:07.350
I suppose.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.000
What's yours?

19:10.120 --> 19:11.590
Flat feet.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.200
Nurse. Thank you.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.550
Ah, you're with Mr Bright, yes? Dr Powell.

19:37.600 --> 19:39.270
How is he?

19:39.320 --> 19:41.670
Well, we're hopeful for a
full recovery, of course,

19:41.720 --> 19:44.070
but we will keep him on Open
Order for the time being,

19:44.120 --> 19:47.160
so please don't feel bound
by general visiting hours.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.630
- Well, thank you.
- Excuse me.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.860
Come on. Let's go and get a drink.

20:03.960 --> 20:07.110
Who was that you were
talking to on the ward?

20:07.160 --> 20:10.790
Oh. I knew her daughter
when I was at Oxford.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.950
Come on.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.670
"I knew her daughter at Oxford and...?"

20:15.720 --> 20:19.670
- You can't just leave it there.
- Maybe when I know you better.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.860
Did she break your heart?

20:23.600 --> 20:26.000
We were engaged to be married.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.080
And then we weren't.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.640
There. So now you know all my secrets.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.800
Come on.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.030
How is he?

21:30.080 --> 21:31.230
Not come to.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.520
- Where's his babysitter?
- Gone for a brew. I said I'd cover.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.230
I understand the operation went
well. We'll look after him.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.760
Great.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.440
- I'm DC Morse.
- Nurse Mills.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.960
Nice to meet you.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.550
Excuse me, sir. Visiting hours are over.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.100
Police. What's your business?

22:42.940 --> 22:46.110
Jesus Christ! Get these cuffs off me!

22:46.160 --> 22:47.990
- Get these cuffs off me now!
- Stay here!

22:48.040 --> 22:50.640
Thursday, don't leave me like this!

22:55.440 --> 22:58.640
Don't worry, Mr Bakewell.
We'll look after you.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.300
Go! Go!

23:47.480 --> 23:49.280
You get the reg?

23:53.800 --> 23:57.310
Out of town talent, like as not
-- London. Birmingham. Glasgow.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.910
- Yes, I'll just get him.
- Put together an Identikit.

24:00.960 --> 24:04.080
- It's the station.
- Right.

24:09.880 --> 24:13.030
Mr Bright's been taken sick, Fred says.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.870
Yes. Ulcer.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.200
Is everything all right?

24:26.280 --> 24:31.990
She told us not to look for
her, but it's been ten weeks now.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.710
I just need to know she's all right.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.190
- Did we do something wrong?
- No.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.110
No. No, no, of course not.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.560
Then why?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.520
I don't know.

24:52.360 --> 24:54.430
- I'm off up.
- Right.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.750
Uniform found the car
abandoned on Holywell Street.

25:02.800 --> 25:06.790
I've ordered the guard on Bakewell
doubled. Sentries front and back.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.390
Why, do you think he'll try again?

25:08.440 --> 25:11.240
Not if I've got anything to do with it.

25:20.380 --> 25:22.770
- Picture ready?
- Yes, sir.

25:22.820 --> 25:24.610
- Erm...
- Anything else?

25:24.660 --> 25:28.210
The getaway car was reported stolen
in Coventry yesterday afternoon.

25:28.260 --> 25:31.530
Wheel and door panels wiped clean
according to the fingerprint boys.

25:31.580 --> 25:34.320
- Looks like professionals.
- Right.

25:35.340 --> 25:37.890
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

25:37.940 --> 25:41.260
I don't care who they are, they're
not taking liberties. Not here.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.840
So what was he in for, Mr Zacharides?

25:48.300 --> 25:49.900
Gall bladder.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.940
I didn't think you'd need a
postmortem if you died in hospital.

25:54.980 --> 25:59.010
- Sir Merlyn insisted.
- Why?

25:59.060 --> 26:03.610
Operation was a success, and Mr
Zacharides seemed to be recovering well.

26:03.660 --> 26:05.730
Just went in the night.

26:07.100 --> 26:10.490
- Who operated on him?
- The Young Pretender.

26:10.540 --> 26:11.970
Dr Powell.

26:12.020 --> 26:16.050
Not a lot of love lost
between him and Sir Merlyn.

26:16.100 --> 26:19.530
Word on the wards is
Powell fancies his job.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.770
- How does Merlyn feel about that? - Hm.

26:21.820 --> 26:26.540
"Over my dead body" is the phrase
that springs most readily to mind.

26:27.620 --> 26:31.500
Ah, Nurse Hicks. Just pop them
on my desk, please, thank you.

26:45.780 --> 26:47.320
Hello, Gil.

26:47.460 --> 26:50.250
Somebody tried to do for
Terry Bakewell last night.

26:50.300 --> 26:52.250
- Him.
- I want to know who he is,

26:52.300 --> 26:55.500
where he is and which
shitehawk staked the job.

26:56.220 --> 26:59.050
Don't make me ask again,
Gil. I haven't had breakfast.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.100
- Argh!
- Who is he?

27:01.940 --> 27:05.610
I don't know his... real name.

27:05.660 --> 27:07.370
They call him Scotch Tam.

27:07.420 --> 27:10.730
Down from Aberdeen or somewhere.

27:10.780 --> 27:13.530
Don't bother looking.
You won't see him again.

27:13.580 --> 27:15.610
How did he know where to find Bakewell?

27:15.660 --> 27:18.490
Oh, some bent screw at Farnleigh.

27:18.540 --> 27:20.610
Who put the money down?

27:21.500 --> 27:24.500
Whip-round, I should
think. What do you think?

27:25.540 --> 27:28.620
I'd get that seen to, if I
were you, Gil. It looks nasty.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.370
So what did you want to talk to me about?

27:41.100 --> 27:44.900
Is there anything that I
should know about Fosdick Ward?

27:45.740 --> 27:48.850
A patient called Zacharides
died about six months ago.

27:48.900 --> 27:51.130
His wife thinks some of
his things were stolen.

27:51.180 --> 27:56.930
I don't know about thieving, but...
there's something not right there.

27:56.980 --> 27:59.290
Wouldn't be anything to
do with Bed Ten, would it?

27:59.340 --> 28:03.610
- Why? - Just something
one of the patients said.

28:03.660 --> 28:07.360
Being put in Bed Ten is
tantamount to a death sentence.

28:09.460 --> 28:12.370
The mortality rate on Fosdick
Ward is more than it should be,

28:12.420 --> 28:14.930
certainly when compared to
the rest of the hospital.

28:14.980 --> 28:18.610
Patients that had been recovering
suddenly going downhill.

28:18.660 --> 28:22.530
Must be eight or nine have died
unexpectedly in the last six months.

28:22.580 --> 28:24.770
And what do you think?

28:24.820 --> 28:29.100
Don't quote me, but there's
talk Sir Merlyn's past it.

28:32.100 --> 28:36.090
- And what do you make of Dr Powell?
- Seems nice enough.

28:36.140 --> 28:38.860
All the girls seem to like him.

28:48.380 --> 28:50.050
Are you happy?

28:53.020 --> 28:54.690
What about you?

28:58.660 --> 29:00.860
Treat the next one better.

29:15.300 --> 29:17.930
Good Lord! What kind of a
ward are you running, Sister?

29:17.980 --> 29:21.490
The water in that vase is positively
putrid! Take those flowers away at once.

29:21.540 --> 29:24.140
At once, Sir Merlyn. Nurse Bennett!

29:25.740 --> 29:28.210
- Yes, Sister.
- Get rid of those flowers!

29:28.260 --> 29:30.130
Away with them now.

29:31.580 --> 29:33.530
Now then, my good man. Bakewell, isn't it?

29:33.580 --> 29:37.130
You'll be under my knife,
assisted by Dr Powell here.

29:37.180 --> 29:39.930
This is Dr Kane, in charge
of keeping you breathing.

29:39.980 --> 29:41.330
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

29:41.380 --> 29:44.570
- I want to change beds.
- You want to what?

29:44.620 --> 29:48.410
You heard me. All I hear, the life
expectancy in this one ain't too hot.

29:48.460 --> 29:51.930
- Remember who you're talking to.
- I don't care who he is.

29:51.980 --> 29:54.090
Somebody tried to kill me last night,

29:54.140 --> 29:57.810
and Bed Ten's got a bad reputation
amongst my fellow inmates.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.410
- If it's all the same...
- You're a rogue and a jailbird.

30:00.460 --> 30:02.770
You'll go where you're put
and be thankful my oath

30:02.820 --> 30:04.770
obliges me to treat
saint and sinner alike.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.160
Sister.

30:07.820 --> 30:11.290
With the time just coming
up to quarter past nine,

30:11.340 --> 30:13.810
you're listening to Radio Carillon.

30:13.860 --> 30:17.610
How long have you been at
Cowley General, Mr Fagen?

30:17.660 --> 30:21.530
About three years doing the radio
and running the book trolley.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.580
Since the divorce.

30:26.100 --> 30:30.850
- And it's voluntary, you said?
- Oh, yes. I don't get paid.

30:30.900 --> 30:33.450
But my mother was a patient
here, rest her soul,

30:33.500 --> 30:37.050
and they were so good to her,
I just wanted to do something.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.850
Hm.

30:43.500 --> 30:46.260
Well, I'll leave you to it.

30:49.620 --> 30:51.820
Any requests, let me know.

30:54.620 --> 30:58.090
- I forgot, Sister.
- Oh! Oh, I know you forgot.

30:58.140 --> 31:02.020
- And how do you think that makes me look?
- I know, Sister. I'm sorry.

31:03.180 --> 31:05.490
- Where did they come from?
- Sister?

31:05.540 --> 31:10.410
- The sweet peas, girl. Who brought them?
- I don't know, Sister.

31:10.460 --> 31:13.810
- Did Mr Bakewell have a visitor?
- I wouldn't have thought so, Sister.

31:13.860 --> 31:17.530
When you asked me to get rid of them,
it was the first time I'd seen them.

31:17.580 --> 31:19.650
Right, then. About your work.

31:19.700 --> 31:24.220
Mr Dunn needs a bed bath and a
full linen change. Quickly, now.

31:25.980 --> 31:27.690
Morning.

31:27.740 --> 31:30.610
I imagine you think that was a bit harsh.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.970
But discipline in a hospital
is a matter of life and death.

31:34.020 --> 31:37.050
Yes, I'm sure. Do you have a
moment? I'd like a quick word.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.460
There's a small amount of petty
pilfering goes on in any hospital.

31:41.460 --> 31:44.060
Patients steal from other patients.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.690
A sad fact, but there it is.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.010
Yes, but what about Mrs Zacharides?

31:49.060 --> 31:51.450
The hospital conducted a thorough inquiry

31:51.500 --> 31:54.600
and found she was mistaken
in her allegations.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.610
Are you busy, Clo?

31:57.660 --> 32:01.410
The officer was just
asking about Mrs Zacharides.

32:01.460 --> 32:03.050
Oh, yes. Er... what about her?

32:03.100 --> 32:07.130
She was found dead yesterday.

32:07.180 --> 32:09.410
Really? Well, I am sorry to hear that.

32:09.460 --> 32:12.810
According to her daughter, she
received a letter from the hospital.

32:12.860 --> 32:15.770
Somebody was set to visit her
Friday, the day she died.

32:15.820 --> 32:19.330
- May I see it?
- I'm afraid the letter's missing.

32:19.380 --> 32:23.330
I have to say, that sounds very
unlikely. Wouldn't you say, Doctor?

32:23.380 --> 32:25.330
Oh, certainly. Yes.

32:25.380 --> 32:28.010
As far as we were concerned,
the matter was closed.

32:28.060 --> 32:30.890
Much as one hates to
speak ill of the dead,

32:30.940 --> 32:33.570
she'd become something of a nuisance.

32:33.620 --> 32:38.130
Coming onto the ward, pestering
the staff, making accusations.

32:38.180 --> 32:41.010
In the end, I'm afraid we had
to threaten her with the police.

32:41.060 --> 32:44.560
- 'Dr Powell to Theatre 6, please.'
- Oh, excuse me.

32:46.260 --> 32:48.820
Do you remember a Mr Zacharides?

32:50.300 --> 32:51.540
Yes.

32:52.660 --> 32:55.000
I was very sorry to lose him.

32:55.780 --> 32:58.490
One tries to maintain
a sense of detachment,

32:58.540 --> 33:00.690
but it's not always easy.

33:00.740 --> 33:03.020
Bed Ten, wasn't he?

33:05.580 --> 33:07.690
Where's that come from?

33:07.740 --> 33:09.050
Mr Talbot?

33:09.100 --> 33:10.410
Hm.

33:10.460 --> 33:13.570
It might have a slightly
higher than average death rate,

33:13.620 --> 33:15.530
but it's not cursed or anything.

33:15.580 --> 33:18.410
It just tends to be the
less-well patients end up in it.

33:18.460 --> 33:22.130
His wife is of the opinion that
some of his things have gone missing.

33:22.180 --> 33:24.330
Not one of the nurses, surely?

33:24.380 --> 33:26.370
Heaven knows we don't get paid much,

33:26.420 --> 33:29.520
but one doesn't go into
nursing for the money.

33:30.220 --> 33:32.410
- It's a calling, I suppose.
- Yes.

33:32.460 --> 33:34.060
If you like.

33:35.340 --> 33:38.010
And policing? What's that?

33:38.060 --> 33:39.700
A failing.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.860
I'll get onto that right away, sir.

34:26.380 --> 34:28.969
Of course, sir. Yes, sir.

34:29.020 --> 34:30.699
No, sir.

34:32.340 --> 34:34.730
Three bags full, sir.

34:34.780 --> 34:36.650
How you getting on?

34:37.580 --> 34:39.409
- Drink?
- Please.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.300
Glass over there.

34:49.460 --> 34:53.330
That sudden out at
Northway, Mrs Zacharides.

34:53.380 --> 34:56.370
According to her daughter, she
was in dispute with Cowley General

34:56.420 --> 34:59.290
over some of her late husband's
property not returned to her.

34:59.340 --> 35:02.330
She thought someone was on
the nick up at the hospital?

35:02.380 --> 35:04.770
- That's about the size of it.
- Staff or public?

35:04.820 --> 35:08.010
Impossible to say. She'd
become something of a nuisance.

35:08.060 --> 35:10.250
The hospital deny any
impropriety, naturally,

35:10.300 --> 35:14.050
and as far as they were
concerned, the matter was closed.

35:14.100 --> 35:15.250
So?

35:15.300 --> 35:19.250
Well, according to the daughter, she
received a letter from the hospital.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.530
Someone was set to visit
her on the day she died.

35:21.580 --> 35:24.210
Why would the hospital do
that if it was done and dusted?

35:24.260 --> 35:25.410
Another thing.

35:25.460 --> 35:28.930
Mr Zacharides died in
Bed Ten on Fosdick Ward.

35:28.980 --> 35:30.450
Now, I know it sounds ridiculous

35:30.500 --> 35:34.010
but it has something of a dark
reputation amongst its patients.

35:34.060 --> 35:34.930
What?

35:34.980 --> 35:38.010
Well, it does have a slightly
higher than average mortality rate.

35:38.060 --> 35:41.360
Patients on the mend
taking a turn for the worse.

35:41.700 --> 35:42.970
I'd like to look into it.

35:43.020 --> 35:47.810
Well... pursue inquiries as you see fit.

35:47.860 --> 35:49.410
There.

35:49.460 --> 35:52.460
That's one decent
decision I've made today.

35:54.660 --> 35:56.540
Anything else?

36:07.740 --> 36:08.850
Doctor.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.740
I won't have student nurses bullied.

36:12.820 --> 36:15.690
Any particular student nurse
you had in mind, Doctor?

36:15.740 --> 36:17.810
Just knock it off, Clo.

36:18.700 --> 36:19.900
Dean.

36:20.980 --> 36:23.060
Someone knows.

36:29.340 --> 36:30.820
Home.

36:34.460 --> 36:35.860
I'm home.

36:53.180 --> 36:55.650
What's this?

36:55.700 --> 36:57.020
Win?

37:02.060 --> 37:03.740
Love of God.

37:07.540 --> 37:09.060
Winifred!

37:11.380 --> 37:13.720
I went to see Dr Moody today.

37:18.820 --> 37:21.820
- For what?
- Nerves.

37:23.860 --> 37:25.660
Not sleeping.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.900
I just don't feel myself, Fred.

37:31.060 --> 37:32.860
What's that mean?

37:35.500 --> 37:40.260
You just need something to... take
you out of yourself, that's all.

37:45.220 --> 37:48.320
Why don't you go and
spend the week at Rene's?

37:49.060 --> 37:52.000
I just don't want to go outside the house.

37:53.780 --> 37:55.580
I get frightened.

37:59.340 --> 38:01.900
- Of what?
- I don't know.

38:03.780 --> 38:06.010
It's just like that lately.

38:06.060 --> 38:08.300
I get very nervous.

38:12.060 --> 38:14.860
I'd do anything for you. You know that.

38:16.900 --> 38:18.300
But...

38:19.660 --> 38:22.490
.. I can't fix a thing if I
don't know what it is I'm...

38:22.540 --> 38:24.540
I'm trying to fix.

38:27.420 --> 38:29.090
What can I do?

38:31.980 --> 38:33.580
I don't know.

38:46.940 --> 38:48.650
Leave the window for me.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.780
Where are you going? As if I didn't know.

38:52.900 --> 38:54.290
You won't tell.

38:54.340 --> 38:57.260
I should. But no, you're all right.

38:58.540 --> 39:01.730
- For God's sake, don't let Sister
catch you. - Wicked old cow.

39:01.780 --> 39:05.090
Look, I know she seems a bit
fuddy-duddy by today's standards,

39:05.140 --> 39:08.640
but are you sure you really
know what you're doing?

39:09.140 --> 39:12.010
- What do you mean?
- Doctors and nurses?

39:12.060 --> 39:14.410
It all seems lovely in
some silly paperback,

39:14.460 --> 39:17.130
but in real life, these
things can go awfully wrong.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.250
It's just a bit of fun.

39:19.780 --> 39:22.050
If that's your idea of fun.

39:24.500 --> 39:27.500
- I'm being careful, Jo.
- I should hope so.

39:47.140 --> 39:49.740
Not too long out of bed, Mr Talbot.

39:53.340 --> 39:55.010
How you feeling?

39:55.060 --> 39:59.250
I've brung you a few grapes,
seeing as you've had no visitors.

39:59.300 --> 40:02.600
So, you're public enemy
number one, then, is it?

40:02.800 --> 40:05.250
All right. Don't get
your bowels in an uproar.

40:05.300 --> 40:10.490
I've had er... I've had the odd
run-in with the law in my time.

40:10.540 --> 40:12.530
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

40:12.580 --> 40:16.020
When I was a boy. Nothing in
your league, I don't suppose.

40:18.140 --> 40:21.580
So, er... what's your line, then?

40:24.340 --> 40:27.020
- Murder.
- Oh.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.780
I get an uncontrollable
urge to kill nosy parkers.

40:33.060 --> 40:35.700
- Ta for the grapes.
- Right.

41:01.420 --> 41:06.340
♪ I get along without you very well

41:08.780 --> 41:10.780
♪ Of course I do

41:13.900 --> 41:16.940
♪ Except when soft rains fall

41:18.300 --> 41:22.490
♪ And drip from leaves that I recall

41:22.540 --> 41:25.450
- No Morse?
- Day's leave, sir.

41:25.500 --> 41:28.290
He asked if he could borrow the
car. I said it was all right.

41:28.340 --> 41:30.610
Family is it, or something?

41:30.660 --> 41:32.210
Didn't say, sir.

41:32.260 --> 41:35.770
- Anything more on this gunman?
- Thomas Fraser, sir.

41:35.820 --> 41:38.250
Been in Glasgow the last few years.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.690
Frequent guest of Her
Majesty at Barlinnie.

41:40.740 --> 41:44.170
Suspected of involvement in several
gangland killings up there.

41:44.220 --> 41:45.690
Gun for hire.

41:45.740 --> 41:48.090
Stick out like a sore thumb
in this neck of the woods.

41:48.140 --> 41:50.410
So why haven't we found him?

42:34.420 --> 42:37.530
Hello, sir. Detective Constable
Morse. Oxford City Police.

42:37.580 --> 42:40.330
- Mr...?
- Booth.

42:40.380 --> 42:42.520
Have you seen this lady?

42:47.900 --> 42:50.040
She's not in any trouble.

42:52.060 --> 42:53.420
54.

43:05.620 --> 43:06.890
Morse.

43:08.060 --> 43:10.260
Miss Thursday.

43:13.280 --> 43:16.380
I had a reverse charges
call from Leamington.

43:17.120 --> 43:19.080
Well, it wasn't me.

43:22.440 --> 43:24.040
Oh. Right.

43:26.320 --> 43:30.360
Well, I just wanted to see how you were.

43:33.320 --> 43:34.880
I'm fine.

43:42.200 --> 43:44.740
What are you doing with yourself?

43:48.440 --> 43:50.070
Doing with myself?

43:50.120 --> 43:52.160
For money and...

43:53.400 --> 43:54.950
I told you. I'm all right.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.070
Yeah, I see.

43:57.120 --> 44:01.230
And er... what about you?

44:01.280 --> 44:03.200
Me? Er...

44:04.600 --> 44:07.520
Oh, just... just... just work.

44:11.320 --> 44:13.990
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yes.

44:14.040 --> 44:15.910
Er... but actually just a squash.

44:15.960 --> 44:19.200
Um... I've got the car.

44:39.080 --> 44:42.590
No, I appreciate that, sir,

44:42.640 --> 44:46.630
I just felt apprehending whoever
attempted to murder Terence Bakewell

44:46.680 --> 44:50.270
had priority over discussing traffic
congestion with Councillor Rooney.

44:50.320 --> 44:52.920
That's why I was out of the office.

44:56.640 --> 44:58.070
Yes, sir.

44:58.120 --> 45:01.800
I'll talk to the Town Planning
Department this afternoon.

45:04.160 --> 45:05.830
Of course, sir.

45:07.840 --> 45:09.640
Thank you, sir.

45:18.320 --> 45:19.860
Bugger this.

45:22.040 --> 45:25.750
I'd sooner that you didn't tell
Mum and Dad that you'd seen me.

45:25.800 --> 45:29.310
You should get in touch.
Or drop them a line.

45:29.360 --> 45:31.190
Or something.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.840
And say what?

45:34.560 --> 45:37.430
Just let them know that you're all right.

45:39.080 --> 45:41.350
It's the right thing to do.

45:43.080 --> 45:45.230
Oh, the right thing.

45:45.280 --> 45:48.270
I've always done the right
thing, for all the good it's done.

45:48.320 --> 45:51.030
What happened at the bank
was nothing to do with you.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.910
It's not your fault that
Ronny Gidderton died.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.430
You know that's not true.

45:55.480 --> 45:58.220
If I hadn't got mixed up with that....

46:00.640 --> 46:03.240
The daughter of a police inspector.

46:06.440 --> 46:10.200
Well, it doesn't matter now
cos I'm not coming back.

46:15.320 --> 46:16.520
Why?

46:18.000 --> 46:20.670
- What will you do?
- I don't know.

46:23.520 --> 46:25.950
Go abroad?

46:26.000 --> 46:27.430
I don't care.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.200
I do.

46:32.240 --> 46:33.910
You shouldn't.

46:35.640 --> 46:37.200
You know...

46:38.240 --> 46:39.910
.. I thought...

46:42.640 --> 46:44.780
I thought for a minute...

46:47.160 --> 46:48.760
Nearly.

46:51.320 --> 46:54.630
All those times you walked me home.

46:54.680 --> 46:57.840
The perfect gentleman and you
never tried it on, not once.

47:04.680 --> 47:07.080
It's funny how things turn out.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.440
It can turn out how you want it to.

47:26.200 --> 47:28.940
You should... You should probably go.

48:01.160 --> 48:04.110
Reading material? Got 'em all here.

48:04.160 --> 48:06.230
Westerns. Romance. Crime.

48:06.280 --> 48:09.750
- Latest Kent Finn?
- Nothing, thank you.

48:09.800 --> 48:13.070
I've got a tumour on Windsor
Ward reading Lady Chatterley,

48:13.120 --> 48:15.190
but I don't expect he'll
get to the end of it.

48:15.240 --> 48:18.320
- Want me to pop your name down?
- That really won't be necessary.

48:37.360 --> 48:39.230
Hello. What's your name?

48:39.280 --> 48:41.590
Charlie, don't bother the gentleman.

48:41.640 --> 48:43.950
- It's quite all right.
- Come here.

48:44.000 --> 48:45.960
You got kids?

48:48.000 --> 48:49.110
No.

48:49.160 --> 48:53.830
I've got a daughter, Barbara. 23, she is.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.830
I've got a picture of
her in my wallet here.

48:55.880 --> 48:58.070
Don't trouble yourself
on my account. Really.

48:58.120 --> 49:00.190
We're not friends, Mr Bakewell.

49:00.240 --> 49:02.110
No need to be like that, copper.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.030
I'm just trying to pass the time of day.

49:04.080 --> 49:06.190
We're all in the same boat here.

49:06.240 --> 49:11.190
As may be, but don't presume
to some easy familiarity by it.

49:11.240 --> 49:12.830
Don't fool yourself.

49:12.880 --> 49:16.310
You might have a nice house and
sit on the bowls club committee,

49:16.360 --> 49:21.080
but when it comes down to it, we're
just two cheeks on the same arse.

49:22.840 --> 49:26.590
'Ere, Fred. Who stuck a
broom handle up his jacksy?

49:26.640 --> 49:28.630
Is that how you get the
station swept, is it?

49:28.680 --> 49:31.780
Mind your manners, or
you'll get one up yours.

49:34.680 --> 49:40.080
I wasn't sure if you'd sooner green
or black, so I got one of each.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.230
Fred.

49:59.280 --> 50:02.590
Listen, the Matthews Gang.

50:02.640 --> 50:06.070
- If anything happens...
- Nothing's gonna happen, Terry.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.830
You're on the mend.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.630
Couple of days, you'll be back
in Farnleigh, safe and sound.

50:10.680 --> 50:14.270
If it does, though, I'm
asking you man to man.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.480
One father to another.

50:17.720 --> 50:21.440
Look out for my Babs.
She don't know nothing.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.260
But they'll come for her all the same.

50:26.360 --> 50:28.900
- I'm begging.
- No need to beg.

50:29.720 --> 50:32.190
They won't touch her. I promise.

50:43.920 --> 50:46.590
- You came.
- Yes, I was passing.

50:46.640 --> 50:48.320
Were you?

50:49.520 --> 50:50.760
No.

50:53.520 --> 50:56.920
- Is it as you remember?
- More or less.

50:59.040 --> 51:02.150
- How's Edgar?
- No change.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.960
Why do they say that? I have no idea.

51:06.480 --> 51:08.550
He's changed utterly.

51:08.600 --> 51:11.360
He's changed beyond all recognition.

51:12.440 --> 51:16.080
- I suppose they mean in his condition.
- I'm aware of what they mean.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.720
It is good of you to come.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.140
We don't see eye to eye.

51:27.080 --> 51:29.080
Why would you be kind?

51:30.800 --> 51:33.000
Because life is too short.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.830
It was all such a long time ago.

51:37.880 --> 51:40.960
- Laying ghosts?
- Yeah, perhaps.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.550
Some places exert an influence
far beyond their due.

51:44.600 --> 51:47.270
People, too.

51:47.320 --> 51:49.270
Yes.

51:49.320 --> 51:51.520
Yes. If you let them.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.350
Now. Good as new.

51:55.400 --> 51:59.070
He'll be back to his thieving
ways before you know it.

51:59.120 --> 52:02.430
- Would you like me to close?
- No.

52:02.480 --> 52:05.920
I'd like the odds of my patient's
survival to be better than evens.

52:09.040 --> 52:13.350
Why doesn't he just retire? I'm
sure his mind's going, or his nerve.

52:13.400 --> 52:15.670
Did you see his hand shake?

52:16.960 --> 52:19.830
Seen that new little redhead
on Maybury? Legs up to here.

52:19.880 --> 52:22.230
Get it while it's hot, boyo. Or I will.

52:22.280 --> 52:24.550
I'm all right on that score.

52:26.720 --> 52:29.120
How is it you know Sir Merlyn?

52:30.120 --> 52:31.990
He saved Susan's life.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.390
Two years ago.

52:34.440 --> 52:37.200
Her heart, of all things.

52:38.560 --> 52:43.630
And as a mark of gratitude, Edgar
left a major bequest in his will.

52:43.680 --> 52:45.910
- To the hospital?
- No.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.670
To Merlyn, personally.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.830
He's about to retire soon, isn't he?

52:50.880 --> 52:54.390
No, he's not going to retire.
Not as far as I know.

52:54.440 --> 52:56.240
Why do you ask?

52:58.360 --> 53:01.100
I'm just trying to build up a picture.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
- And have you spoken to Susan?
- Of course.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.020
I haven't mentioned you.

53:11.760 --> 53:13.430
No.

53:13.480 --> 53:15.880
Well, I didn't think you would.

53:32.080 --> 53:33.350
Nurse!

53:43.080 --> 53:45.430
Are you all right?

53:45.480 --> 53:48.590
- Can you give me something for the pain?
- I'll fetch Dr Powell.

54:10.280 --> 54:12.430
Right time on the wards today.

54:12.480 --> 54:15.800
Nurse Daisy's in trouble
with Sister again.

54:17.400 --> 54:19.440
Too much mascara.

54:21.920 --> 54:23.720
Not like you, eh?

54:48.440 --> 54:50.200
Evil old cow!

54:54.320 --> 54:56.720
- Morning.
- Morning, Sister.

54:58.440 --> 55:02.040
- Anything to report?
- No, Sister. Uneventful night.

55:05.800 --> 55:07.800
Morning, Mr Bakewell.

55:09.080 --> 55:10.790
Mr Bakewell?

55:10.840 --> 55:13.040
Sister. Sister!

55:19.400 --> 55:21.030
Nurse Mills, get the Doctor.

55:21.080 --> 55:23.080
Get the screen round.

55:34.180 --> 55:37.530
Mr Bakewell was found dead
shortly after 7.30 this morning,

55:37.580 --> 55:39.570
when the day staff came on shift.

55:39.620 --> 55:42.780
We're not in the habit of keeping
the deceased on the ward.

55:44.620 --> 55:48.330
- What condition was he in after the operation?
- Recovering well, I believe.

55:48.380 --> 55:51.210
Then how do you explain his taking
a sudden turn for the worse?

55:51.260 --> 55:54.450
I'm afraid we'll have to leave
that for the postmortem, but er...

55:54.500 --> 55:59.380
I believe Dr Powell was on call and
attended to Bakewell last night.

56:13.260 --> 56:15.170
I was on Nightingale Ward.

56:15.220 --> 56:18.130
Nurse Byron came and asked
me to attend to Mr Bakewell.

56:18.180 --> 56:21.770
- What time was that?
- It was a little after three o'clock.

56:21.820 --> 56:23.570
He was in some discomfort.

56:23.620 --> 56:27.690
I told Nurse Byron to administer two
opioid analgesics orally, and then I left.

56:27.740 --> 56:31.530
Just before three o'clock, Mr Bakewell
asked for something to help with the pain.

56:31.580 --> 56:32.970
So I went and found Dr Powell.

56:33.020 --> 56:35.010
How long were you gone from the ward?

56:35.060 --> 56:37.410
Ten minutes? It's about
four minutes there.

56:37.460 --> 56:41.290
I spoke to Dr Powell for perhaps two
minutes, and then four minutes back.

56:41.340 --> 56:44.650
There couldn't have been any mistake
in the dosage you gave Mr Bakewell?

56:44.700 --> 56:47.810
- It was exactly what Dr Powell prescribed?
- A couple of painkillers.

56:47.860 --> 56:50.890
Um... sorry, Dr Powell's
completely thorough.

56:50.940 --> 56:53.650
The unpaid overtime he puts in.

56:53.700 --> 56:55.850
He even comes in when he
doesn't have to be here,

56:55.900 --> 56:57.730
just to check on his patients.

56:57.780 --> 57:00.530
- Doesn't he?
- I... I suppose.

57:00.580 --> 57:03.130
And you weren't away from
the ward at any other time

57:03.180 --> 57:06.090
until you were relieved this
morning at the time of shift?

57:06.140 --> 57:08.410
No. No, I wasn't.

57:08.460 --> 57:11.890
We found the stem of a bunch
of grapes under his bed.

57:11.940 --> 57:14.810
Any idea where that could have come from?

57:15.020 --> 57:18.020
That was a gift, I
believe, from Mr Talbot.

57:20.420 --> 57:21.530
Anything?

57:21.580 --> 57:24.290
Constable Jones said he didn't
leave his side all night.

57:24.340 --> 57:25.890
He's a good man, sir.

57:25.940 --> 57:29.010
Well, somebody got to Bakewell and
my money's on Scotch Tam Fraser.

57:29.060 --> 57:30.610
Reckon he came back for another go?

57:30.660 --> 57:32.970
How did he get past the
sentry and Constable Jones?

57:33.020 --> 57:35.570
Who knows? But he did. He could
be back in Scotland by now.

57:35.620 --> 57:38.450
- But if he's in Oxford, I want him found.
- Bed Ten again.

57:38.500 --> 57:40.970
Oh, you're not putting
anything by that, are you?

57:41.020 --> 57:43.210
There was one thing, sir.

57:43.260 --> 57:45.210
Jones said he saw the
Sister take something

57:45.260 --> 57:47.170
out of Bakewell's hand when she found him.

57:47.220 --> 57:49.410
- Like what?
- Well, he couldn't be sure,

57:49.460 --> 57:51.930
but he thought it looked like a flower.

57:51.980 --> 57:53.520
A white one.

57:55.500 --> 57:59.490
I don't know what he thinks he
saw, but I'm afraid he's mistaken.

57:59.540 --> 58:01.930
You removed a bunch of
flowers from beside his bed.

58:01.980 --> 58:04.370
That's what I heard you talking
to Nurse Bennett about.

58:04.420 --> 58:07.490
- But what of it?
- Have you any idea where they came from?

58:07.540 --> 58:10.090
I've more important things
to be doing with my time.

58:10.140 --> 58:12.290
My point is, how could he
have received any flowers

58:12.340 --> 58:13.890
if he didn't have any visitors?

58:13.940 --> 58:18.130
I expect they belonged to another
patient that had been discharged.

58:18.180 --> 58:22.380
Rather than throw them out, one of
the nurses or porters donated them.

58:24.020 --> 58:27.940
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I've a ward to run.

58:29.100 --> 58:33.810
Well, I um... came to in
the early hours, briefly.

58:33.860 --> 58:36.400
There was a screen around his bed.

58:37.460 --> 58:39.610
Someone was in there with him.

58:39.660 --> 58:42.730
I could see a shadow moving
about. It was a nurse, I think.

58:42.780 --> 58:44.330
- You didn't see which one?
- No.

58:44.380 --> 58:47.170
Just the silhouette of a uniform.

58:47.220 --> 58:49.930
- Where was Constable Jones?
- I don't know. Wasn't there.

58:49.980 --> 58:53.100
Anything else, sir? Anything at all?

58:56.420 --> 58:59.090
No. I must have fallen asleep again.

58:59.860 --> 59:02.930
That's the end of our case
against the Matthews Gang.

59:02.980 --> 59:05.380
Bakewell was our star witness.

59:06.620 --> 59:09.330
I've had another word with
Jones, sir. He's come clean.

59:09.380 --> 59:12.120
Call of nature. Five minutes, he says.

59:14.820 --> 59:18.610
I'll talk to the rest of the patients,
see if anyone else saw anything.

59:18.660 --> 59:20.100
Sir.

59:23.660 --> 59:26.770
- Told you, didn't I?
- Yes, you told me all right, Mr Talbot.

59:26.820 --> 59:30.520
- Did you see anything?
- Oh, no, no. Out like a light.

59:31.260 --> 59:33.810
You gave Bakewell a bunch
of grapes, I believe.

59:33.860 --> 59:35.850
Well, half a bunch. Felt sorry for him.

59:35.900 --> 59:38.640
On his ownsome, no visitors, you know.

59:40.020 --> 59:42.010
You're a regular patient here, are you?

59:42.060 --> 59:45.170
Oh, yeah, yeah, I've been in and
out a bit. On account of my guts.

59:45.220 --> 59:48.250
I wonder if you could give
me a list of all of the dates

59:48.300 --> 59:51.410
you stayed over the past... six months.

59:51.460 --> 59:54.000
And did you see anything unusual?

59:54.860 --> 59:57.290
No, it was pretty quiet, to be honest.

59:57.340 --> 01:00:01.130
I had a couple of urine samples
to run over to Pathology.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.580
That's in a separate block.

01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:09.500
Oh, and Mrs Waldegrave on Hyacinth
Ward died about one o'clock.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.930
Have you any idea why
Bakewell would have been found

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.530
with a flower in his hand?

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.850
Well, if it had been a white flower,

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:21.250
the staff do do that if
it's a child that's died.

01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:24.650
When they lay 'em out, they put
a little flower in their hand,

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.450
like a white rose, or a daisy or such.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:29.850
For the parents.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.240
They look like little angels.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.300
It's hard to believe
they've gone sometimes.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.180
But they have.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.300
Information Room from Trewlove.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:19.820
Information Room from Trewlove.

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:24.760
Been here since Wednesday,
from the parking tickets.

01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.930
Ohh! Gee-whizz!

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.730
That's Tam Fraser.

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:40.290
So it couldn't have been him that did for
Bakewell, not if he was already dead.

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:44.300
- That'll be his driver, presumably.
- Get the pathologist out.

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.610
Dead two days, according to DeBryn
-- Scotch Tam and his driver.

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:00.930
Two shots apiece. Point-blank range.

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.530
What's this?

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.290
All the deaths in Bed Ten on Fosdick Ward.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.930
With Bakewell, that's nine
in the last six months.

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.810
And all of them are Dr Powell's.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:12.090
- What do we know about him?
- Not much.

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.410
- Sir Merlyn fancies he's
after his job. - Is he?

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:15.890
Who knows? There's no love lost.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.370
I've asked for his records
from Long Hampton and Finisham.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.810
What about other members of staff?

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:23.730
The porter, Capper, he was on
duty for most of the deaths.

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.850
Erm... the nurses. It's a changing roster,

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.690
so all of them have access to the ward.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.410
- Patients? - The only
long-term one is Burt Talbot.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.760
He was present for four
of the deaths in Bed Ten.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.840
Where were you yesterday?

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.850
I had things to do.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:43.940
Family, or...?

01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.170
Well, if you need an
ear, or more time off...

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:51.410
No, no, no, I'm fine, thank you.

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.130
It's done now.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.300
Keep me posted.

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.580
Wrong office.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:41.770
Is that Mrs Robson?

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.490
The jeweller's wife.

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:45.330
Naomi.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.380
- You were married?
- She left me for Robson.

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.330
And Bakewell was in the
gang that left her paralysed.

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.730
You think I'd do something
to him over a woman?

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:59.770
Yes... I do... if you were
still in love with her.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.490
I suppose you think that's pathetic.

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.450
I didn't do anything to Bakewell.

01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.410
Where were you last night?

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.810
Finished my shift here, got home at 11.

01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.690
Right. Anyone vouch for you?

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.930
Now you're just trying to be funny.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.330
Can anyone vouch for you?

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:21.010
Slight change of scenery for you,
Mr Bright. Bed Ten, please, Capper.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:24.130
- Right you are, Sister.
- I was quite happy where I was.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:27.480
- Dr Powell's orders.
- There you go, Mr Bright.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.130
He'll be by later to discuss your X-rays.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:33.940
Did they talk to you?

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.450
Not that I could tell them
much. I mean, I just found him.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:40.800
Dean says they've been
in and out of everything.

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:42.330
Dean, is it, now?

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.210
I think "Dr Powell" would be appropriate.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:48.860
I think after last night,
I can call him what I like.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.050
You're wasting your
breath. She's a big girl.

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:58.490
But you know what his reputation's
like. And they do talk, doctors.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:01.810
She doesn't want to be just
another notch on the bedpost.

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:05.530
- We nurses need to look out for each other.
- I don't get it at all.

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.450
Give them a white coat and a stethoscope,

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.370
and we're expected to fall at their feet?

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:19.820
Evening.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.300
Some food for you.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:03.310
It bears the hospital letterhead,
but we've no Dr Keenan here.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.910
Nor have we, in the 20
years I've been here.

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:10.070
Well, whoever sent it seems
to have a good knowledge

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.470
of Mrs Zacharides'
dispute with the hospital.

01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:15.960
As may be. But it did not come
from within Cowley General.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.550
- You all right, sir?
- It's nothing.

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.190
Overwork.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.040
I'm due a holiday.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:27.040
Your hands would shake
too if you had my lists.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.150
So, someone claiming
to be from the hospital

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.430
makes a bogus appointment with
Mrs Zacharides, and does her in.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.870
Presumably to stop her from digging
into what happened to her husband.

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.270
- The bureau was in a mess,
didn't you say? - Mm-hm.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.710
Maybe the killer was looking for
the letter to cover their tracks.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:48.150
Ah, gentlemen. Sergeant Strange
said you were on the premises.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.630
Do you have a moment? I believe
it will be to your advantage.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.510
The late Mr Bakewell.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.270
As you know from my previous examination,

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:58.990
there was nothing to
suggest anything untoward

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.030
in the manner of his decease.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.750
However, when I looked again, I found...

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.190
Ah. Do you see?

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.910
A very tiny wound on his right buttock.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.270
That's not much bigger than a pin prick.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.030
Actually, the prick of
a hypodermic needle.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.230
Nothing unusual in that, perhaps.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:18.910
Mr Bakewell died in a hospital, after all.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.830
So, I checked his records.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:25.310
Mr Bakewell only received oral analgesic.

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.750
No injections?

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.710
So somebody stuck him with
something. Any idea what?

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:32.230
There's nothing shown up
on his blood toxicology.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.430
However, I'm going to take a
sample from around this area.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.390
Might shed some light.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:41.950
- What about Mrs Zacharides?
- Been collected by the undertakers.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.510
I've spoken to them. Her
body's already been embalmed.

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:47.550
There was another one. Down in
Bed Ten earlier this week. Mr...

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:49.790
Oh, erm, Mr Greely.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:52.430
- Yes. - Yes, it's the
same there, I'm afraid.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:55.220
So we've no way to make a comparison?

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.440
Well, there might be.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.670
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.030
Now, which one's this?

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.950
Arthur Carpenter. Died
in July. Unembalmed.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.830
Anything further on your
examination of Bakewell?

01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.910
Markedly high levels of insulin in the
tissue surrounding the injection site.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.710
How come that wasn't found at postmortem?

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.859
Insulin disappears from
the blood after death.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:29.350
Now, we don't fully
understand the mechanism

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:33.149
whereby hypoglycaemia brings on death,

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.029
but the latest thinking is
a fall in glucose levels

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.350
causes a massive release of adrenaline,

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:42.390
which triggers an electrical
disturbance in the heart.

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.410
Looks like we're there.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.359
Crikey, he's ripe.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:14.310
Yeah, left buttock.

01:09:14.359 --> 01:09:17.640
- Minute puncture wound.
- Same as Bakewell.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.910
- How'd it go?
- You wouldn't have enjoyed it.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:36.149
But he appears to have been another
victim, according to Dr DeBryn.

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:39.069
- Anything on Powell?
- Well, there's nothing from Finisham.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:42.109
But he seems to have left Long
Hampton under something of a cloud.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:44.590
There was a death on the
children's ward 15 years ago.

01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.149
- Where's this?
- Warwickshire. An 11-year-old girl.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.430
Molly Keenan.

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:51.870
The letter to Mrs Zacharides was
signed "M Keenan", wasn't it?

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.630
The parents tried to bring a case
for negligence against Dr Powell,

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.470
but he was cleared on the evidence
of a young nurse, Clodagh MacMahon.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.260
Sister MacMahon.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.800
Dr Powell.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.800
Can you tell us about Molly Keenan?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.960
- What?
- Molly Keenan, Dr Powell.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.030
11-year-old girl at Long Hampton
Hospital, died in your care.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.950
- I was cleared of any involvement.
- From the testimony of Sister MacMahon.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.710
Insulin overdose, wasn't it?

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.700
Administered by you.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.910
Administered by me, yes.
But the syringe had been

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.870
prepared in error by a student nurse.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.590
Ruby Hiscutt. Who later killed
herself by the same means.

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.590
In the six months since your tenure,

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.590
there have been upward of a
dozen deaths on Fosdick Ward,

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.630
several of whom we can now prove
died from hypoglycaemic shock.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.190
- All of them your patients.
- So what, I'm responsible?

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.790
I think we should continue
this down the station.

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.550
Dean! Dean!

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:58.630
Where are you taking him?
He didn't do anything!

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.430
He's just helping us with our inquiries.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.080
Nurse Bennett. About your business.

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.840
You did this!

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.630
You...

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:13.430
.. evil old cow.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:14.870
That's what they think!

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.950
That's what everybody
calls you behind your back.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.110
An evil old cow.

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.150
- Oi! Oh!
- It's all right, Daisy.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.270
She didn't mean it.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.260
Get her out of here.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.390
Take a look round his office. See if
you can dig anything else up there.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.480
And try his flat. I'll
see you back at the nick.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:01.150
Why would Nurse Bennett think our
arresting Dr Powell was your fault?

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:02.790
Who knows?

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.550
The girl's head is full of fancies.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:10.350
- Is there anything between them?
- I'm sure I don't know.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:14.720
- You were with him at Long Hampton, yes?
- Only very briefly.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.310
But it was your testimony that cleared
him in the case of Molly Keenan.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.790
I didn't clear him.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.870
He was innocent.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.190
It was a young student nurse was to blame.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.870
He wasn't guilty then and I
can't believe he's guilty now.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.840
Can't or won't?

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.840
I believe you know the
stroke case on Fosdick Ward.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:46.430
- Mr Bryce-Morgan?
- Yes. Why? What about him?

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:50.350
He died... 20 minutes ago.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.740
I thought you'd want to know.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.120
Right.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.480
Caroline.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.960
I'm so, so sorry.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:21.720
- Are you?
- Yes, of course.

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.190
Edgar was always very decent to me.

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:28.240
Well, he always had a
weakness for failures.

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:32.830
The Assistant Chief Constable
was a golfing friend of Edgar's.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.830
I asked him about you.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.630
And he said that you'd
never amount to much.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:41.640
You didn't even pass your sergeant's exam.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:46.180
You see, I was right about you, even then.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.910
When you speak to Susan, then
please just give her my condolences.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.630
And your love?

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.720
No.

01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.110
No.

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.880
Look, whatever you may think of me,
I am truly sorry that he is dead.

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.150
Can you explain why Mrs Zacharides

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.390
would receive a letter from
the hospital signed M Keenan?

01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.720
No.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.310
Look, I haven't killed anyone.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.630
They were all your patients, Dr Powell.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.320
If anyone's killing patients in
that hospital, it's Sir Merlyn.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.510
Is this his idea?

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.870
Blame me for his mistakes? Is that it?

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.390
- What mistakes?
- Have you seen his hands?

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.030
The last six months,
he's developed a tremor.

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.750
- Drinks, does he?
- I'm sure he does.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.790
But that is either motor neurone disease,

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.910
or he's medicating
himself for Parkinson's.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.200
Either way, he shouldn't be
within 20 feet of a scalpel.

01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.910
- How's Nurse Bennett?
- She'll be fine.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.080
Is there's something
between her and Dr Powell?

01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.980
It happens.

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.750
It's not Daisy's fault.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.390
There's no fault in love, surely?

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.870
Provided nobody else gets hurt.

01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:20.880
- Has somebody been hurt?
- Not in this instance, no.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.960
- He even tried it on with me.
- Dr Powell did?

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.880
- You weren't interested?
- You can't rely on a man like that.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.670
It's what's inside that counts, isn't it?

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.900
Always.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:21.050
- I found this in Powell's office.
- Mr Zacharides' tie pin.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:23.810
It matches the description
his daughter gave.

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:26.210
Souvenir or...?

01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:29.050
I also found these at his
flat, on top of the wardrobe.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:30.970
He was involved with Sister MacMahon

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.930
when he was a houseman at Long Hampton.

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.650
He's kept some of her love letters,

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.650
and some clippings about the Keenan case.

01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.970
- You think that's a bearing?
- Worth considering.

01:16:39.020 --> 01:16:41.530
He's now seeing that student
nurse, Daisy Bennett.

01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:44.130
Can't be easy for Sister
MacMahon, knowing that.

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:47.780
- What about this?
- Brace him for round two.

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.900
See if there's anything else
in there we can put to him.

01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:09.620
- He's sleeping.
- Probably for the best.

01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:25.250
I've told you already, it's not mine.

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:28.730
No, Doctor. It belonged to Mr Zacharides.

01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:32.010
Have you any explanation how it
came to be found in your office?

01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.570
Someone must have put it there.

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:41.700
Why wasn't Sister MacMahon on the
ward the night Molly Keenan died?

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:44.050
- What?
- You heard.

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.090
A young girl gave
evidence to the inquest --

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.130
Molly Keenan's cousin, Jo-Beth Keenan.

01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:50.330
When she realised her
cousin was gravely ill,

01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:52.410
as a result of the
insulin that you gave her,

01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:56.010
she called the night bell for
assistance, only nobody came. Why?

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:58.250
Why didn't you respond, Doctor?

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:01.970
Was it because you and Nurse MacMahon had
other more pressing things on your mind?

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:04.490
It was because Clodagh switched it off.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.770
It was just half an hour.

01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.450
It might only have been half an hour,

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:11.570
but that was long enough for Molly
Keenan to die of hypoglycaemia.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:14.700
I made a terrible, terrible mistake.

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.890
And a child died.

01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.610
And it will... it will never
be enough to make it right,

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.490
but God knows I have paid for that.

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:25.930
You paid for nothing. You passed the
buck to an innocent student nurse.

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:29.090
She killed herself. That's two
deaths on your head, Doctor.

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:31.450
We couldn't have known she'd do that.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.290
We? You mean you and Clodagh?

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:36.370
You probably don't remember Molly
Keenan's cousin at all, do you?

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:38.810
The young girl who rang
for help, but nobody came.

01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.400
- No.
- No.

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:44.040
Well, she remembers you, both of you.

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.700
Has Mr Bright had an injection?

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:06.800
No. Not while I've been here.

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:21.280
Everything all right, Sister?

01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:24.560
Quite all right.

01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:59.490
Excuse me, Miss. We're
looking for Nurse Mills.

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:02.530
- Jo's on night shift.
- Well, she's not on the ward.

01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:04.890
Have you checked the chapel?

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.260
It's you.

01:21:36.140 --> 01:21:38.410
Dr Powell's not coming back.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:42.360
You can't cover up for him this time.

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:45.650
It's all going to come out now, all of it.

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.490
How the...

01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:50.410
How the pair of you left a child to die.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:55.180
And you... you protected him..

01:21:58.580 --> 01:21:59.820
Why?

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:02.940
I loved him.

01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:10.400
How can you go on living,
knowing what you've done?

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:15.040
If it were me...

01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:17.730
.. I'd...

01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:19.580
I'd kill myself.

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.010
Break it down.

01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.480
- Get her out of here.
- Come on, Sister.

01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:57.290
Let's go.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:59.610
- Don't.
- All right.

01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:01.060
Oh, er...

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:05.420
Ten victims for Bed Ten.

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.240
That was Molly's bed, was it? Bed Ten?

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:14.280
Measles, we were in for.

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:19.380
When Molly started to get
sick, I... I rang on the bell.

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:23.420
It rang and it rang, but nobody came.

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.620
By the time I got them back onto
the ward, it was too late for Molly.

01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.980
She was my cousin.

01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:49.610
And the truth is, I forgot about them.

01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:53.010
I forgot, but I... I never forgave them.

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:56.780
And then fate delivered
them into your hands.

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:01.780
They had to pay. Molly was a child
and they took away her future.

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:05.460
And what about Mrs Zacharides?

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:09.570
Her husband was the first.

01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:12.810
Only she wouldn't leave it alone.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:15.130
You see, it was... it was too early.

01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:17.370
I needed more people
to lay at Powell's door,

01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:20.370
otherwise they could have brushed
it under the carpet, as with Molly.

01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:23.220
So you... So you wrote the letter...

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.010
.. pretending to be from the hospital.

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:28.490
'Went to the house.'

01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:32.140
And then, when the opportunity
arose, you killed her.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:11.290
Evil old cow.

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.890
Evil old cow!

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:18.050
You killed all those people
just to frame Dr Powell?

01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.500
They were sick already.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.010
It was a... a kindness.

01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:27.340
Mrs Zacharides wasn't ill... was she?

01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:30.780
Just inconvenient.

01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:39.490
You said there were ten. I can
only count nine. Who's the tenth?

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.510
Who is it?

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:45.050
I didn't know you were
going to arrest Dr Powell.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.610
I thought if a policeman died,
you'd... you'd have to take notice.

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:51.900
Mr Bright.

01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:04.930
Sir.

01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.500
Sir. Sir!

01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:12.050
- There's insulin in the saline.
- I'll fetch a doctor.

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:15.100
Stay awake, sir! You've
got to stay awake, sir!

01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.720
Stay awake!

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:33.020
Nick of time, according to Dr DeBryn.

01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:37.450
Much more of it, he'd have been a goner.

01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:40.220
Mm. We were lucky she came clean.

01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:45.900
Why did she, do you think?

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:50.330
Maybe she needed to prove to
herself that she wasn't wholly lost.

01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:53.690
Well, she'll never breathe free air again.

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.650
Nor should she.

01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:57.530
People shouldn't get away with things.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.940
She had that right, at least.

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:04.460
That's our business, nobody else's.

01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.970
Hell of a price to pay.

01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:16.180
It was the dead that
paid the price, not her.

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:25.720
Hell of a responsibility, though.

01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:28.530
The power of life and death.

01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:34.140
Well, you've power over ham and tomato.

01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:40.940
I don't even know what
I stuck in it today.

01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:48.890
Tell me to mind my own business,
sir, but is everything all right,

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:51.380
with Mrs Thursday?

01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:59.660
Nothing that Joan walking through
the door wouldn't put right.

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.770
She misses her, that's all.

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:10.300
Suppose we all do.

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.190
You think she'll come back?

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.730
.. on Earth as it is in Heaven.

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:29.130
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:31.570
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:35.530
And lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:39.610
For thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,

01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:42.220
for ever and ever, amen.
