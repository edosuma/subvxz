As I was getting
used to my new reality,

00:10.433 --> 00:12.400
Thomas started
wondering about his.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.166
- I don't blame other women

00:14.166 --> 00:16.767
for wanting to throw
themselves at you.

00:19.033 --> 00:21.033
- Meanwhile,
as the girls were busy

00:21.033 --> 00:22.400
putting the past
behind them...

00:22.400 --> 00:25.233
- You got that a good vibrator.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.033
- Mine's even waterproof.
It goes with me everywhere.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.300
- ...Shep was reconnecting
with an old flame.

00:31.300 --> 00:33.533
- I'm glad you moved here.
- Just gotta get friends.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.133
- Obviously you know Austen.

00:35.133 --> 00:36.133
- He actually just texted me.

00:38.033 --> 00:40.333
- And when the guys try
to get ol' Craigy laid...

00:40.333 --> 00:43.200
- Dude, this is the
most hellish night of my life.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.166
Why is meeting a bunch
of pretty girls hellish?

00:46.200 --> 00:47.467
- Okay, all right.

00:47.467 --> 00:49.200
- ...It turned out
he only had eyes

00:49.200 --> 00:50.433
for the one that got away.

00:50.433 --> 00:52.066
- I think you're angry
because you can't

00:52.066 --> 00:53.400
figure out a reason
we're not together.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.467
- You can't really
say that seriously.

00:55.467 --> 00:57.200

spend my life with you,

02:10.133 --> 02:12.533
an Uber one time
that was talking about

a "coming home" outfit

I live in the South,

04:07.367 --> 04:09.367
You know, he comes home
in his scrubs.

04:09.367 --> 04:11.100
And I told him
he can't do that anymore,

04:11.100 --> 04:13.233
so I made him get naked in
the garage

04:13.233 --> 04:14.467
before he came inside.

04:15.633 --> 04:17.233
- He told me, "You're psycho."

04:19.333 --> 04:21.233
You've got me reading a book.
- Right.

04:21.233 --> 04:22.500
- And you told me
I could not touch her

04:22.500 --> 04:23.500

04:23.500 --> 04:25.100

04:25.100 --> 04:26.734
You dropped me on my head

04:26.734 --> 04:29.166

- You let me fall off the bed.

04:29.166 --> 04:30.700

how to do my laundry

04:40.500 --> 04:43.300

seven years old.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.100
After my parents divorced,

04:45.100 --> 04:46.734
my mom worked full time.

04:46.734 --> 04:51.533

and I to fend for ourselves.

Peyton.

do something with this person.

09:02.734 --> 09:06.734

still in love with you.

09:06.734 --> 09:08.400

Yeah, whatever.
So I'm gonna do it.

"here's, like, proof that

where it goes from that.

Prove your worth to yourself,
not to someone else.

And this is actually my side

So this first meeting, you're
gonna do most of the talking.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.233
I'm going to be super curious.

18:06.233 --> 18:07.433

where you're from.

- Okay, so I'm from the
eastern shore of Delaware.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.433
- So you grew up and went
to high school in Delaware.

18:14.433 --> 18:15.633

18:15.633 --> 18:17.467

did you go to college?

18:17.467 --> 18:21.033
- So I went to--undergraduate
at College of Charleston.

18:21.033 --> 18:24.567
It's after college I went
to Charleston School of Law.

18:24.567 --> 18:27.567
And one of the reasons
I--I called you is,

18:27.567 --> 18:31.166
right now, I'm not, like,
currently doing anything.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.166
- So, do you have a way

18:36.166 --> 18:38.367
that you generate income?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.233
- I have some
investments and stuff,

18:40.233 --> 18:42.233
but not nearly
what I could be doing.

18:45.066 --> 18:47.367
what's going on
in your life today?

18:47.367 --> 18:50.200
- Sure, yeah, if I--
and if I do talk too much,

18:50.200 --> 18:52.367
you can just tell me I am.

18:52.367 --> 18:54.467
- Now, what're some
of your thoughts about

18:54.467 --> 18:56.200
your talking so much?

18:56.200 --> 18:59.266
- My ex didn't like when
I talk over people.

18:59.266 --> 19:00.600
You don't really have a...
- You'll never, ever, ever,

19:00.600 --> 19:02.500
ever be accountable
for anything.

19:02.500 --> 19:03.600
- Yes, I will.
- You will always deflect.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.133
You'll always talk over!

19:06.333 --> 19:09.467
- It's because I can finish

19:09.467 --> 19:11.133
their sentence in my head.

19:11.133 --> 19:13.100
- What do you think

19:13.100 --> 19:15.200
that tells us about you?

19:15.200 --> 19:17.400
- My mind is hyperactive.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.200
I can be on my phone and tell
you every single thing

19:19.200 --> 19:21.200
that was said on the TV.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.133
I can tell you how many lizards
have been on the deck out there

19:24.133 --> 19:26.433
since we started talking.

19:26.433 --> 19:29.700
- So, a lot of people,
we hear the word "hyperactive"

19:29.700 --> 19:30.700
in a negative light.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.300
Well, let's not do that.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.133
That's kind of not
being nice to yourself.

19:34.133 --> 19:36.500
I'm also been listening to you.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.533
You're a fast processor.

19:39.533 --> 19:43.166
That's one of the ways
we measure intelligence.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.567
You're very sharp.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.633
And you have great eye contact.

19:46.633 --> 19:48.500
You're very winning.

19:48.500 --> 19:50.433
- Likeable.
And cute.

19:50.433 --> 19:51.567
Yeah.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.300
This is great.

19:53.300 --> 19:56.233
I'm actually, you know,
an awesome person.

19:56.233 --> 19:59.533
The way Naomie approached
things with me,

19:59.533 --> 20:01.367
it was just so negative,
and so, like,

20:01.367 --> 20:03.367
it was just final.

20:03.367 --> 20:06.133
- If this is who you are,
then go be yourself.

20:06.133 --> 20:07.400
But not with me,

20:07.400 --> 20:09.533
because I don't like
the way that you are.

20:09.533 --> 20:12.667
You exhibit loser behavior.

20:12.667 --> 20:16.700
You sit home and you sew
and you pretend to do things.

20:19.266 --> 20:20.700
- So, in summary, I guess,

20:20.700 --> 20:23.333
you are a very
confident person.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.567
But, you do drop into using

20:25.567 --> 20:28.200
words that can have some
negative weight to them

20:28.200 --> 20:29.266
to describe yourself.

20:29.266 --> 20:30.467
- Okay.

20:30.467 --> 20:32.533
- So we're gonna be
practicing you being

20:32.533 --> 20:35.667
much more accurate and positive.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.433
And you're gonna practice
your listening.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.333
And that's gonna help
with your patience,

20:39.333 --> 20:42.333
and your connection
with self and others.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.266
So, the first
homework assignment,

20:44.266 --> 20:45.533

I see a side to her

22:27.633 --> 22:29.533
I don't necessarily like.

22:32.567 --> 22:35.367

lacks subtlety.

22:35.367 --> 22:38.433

everything is just love.

23:06.467 --> 23:10.433
Let's face it,
Thomas looking for perfection

23:10.433 --> 23:11.734
is kind of a conundrum.

23:11.734 --> 23:15.000
I mean, why should
he of all people

23:15.000 --> 23:16.567

like, a finishing school,

She's not Southern, you know?
It's in the DNA.

an invite?

25:26.700 --> 25:28.433

25:28.433 --> 25:30.000

handle that party.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.700

pleased the other day

25:31.700 --> 25:34.100

when I mentioned it all.

25:34.100 --> 25:36.133

dating a friend of mine,

25:36.133 --> 25:37.767
I really didn't think
it would bother me.

25:37.767 --> 25:39.633
But it pissed me off.

25:39.633 --> 25:42.000
So I think it's just like
human nature

25:42.000 --> 25:43.533
for Naomie to get
a little jealous.

25:43.533 --> 25:44.667
Have you been out

25:53.000 --> 25:54.734

25:54.734 --> 25:56.133
- Shep has no desire
to get a job,

25:56.133 --> 25:57.133
'cause he doesn't
need to get one.

25:57.133 --> 25:58.533
- Right.

25:58.533 --> 26:00.467
- Yeah, and my mom's,
"What're you doing?"

26:00.467 --> 26:02.066
And I kind of laid out
something for her.

26:02.066 --> 26:04.400
I think I'm gonna stay
in the beer industry,

26:04.400 --> 26:05.667

26:05.667 --> 26:07.166

wanting to back you?

26:08.533 --> 26:10.066

26:10.066 --> 26:12.667
- ----ing get after it.
Put some effort into it.

26:12.667 --> 26:14.600
- All right.
You're stressing me out.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.700
- Someone needs to light
a fire under your ass.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.400
- Yeah, that's--
their names are Tom and Wendy.

35:26.533 --> 35:28.333
- Where are the kids
gonna be for Halloween?

35:28.333 --> 35:30.100
- I'm taking them
trick or treating.

35:30.100 --> 35:32.600
In fact, Ashley said we--
we should invite you...

35:33.533 --> 35:35.500
- Mm, my God.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.266
I would love for you and I to
be able to do things like that,

35:38.266 --> 35:40.000
but it's too soon.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.533
Are you kidding me?
I just met her.

35:42.533 --> 35:44.333
So, uh, no thank you.

35:44.333 --> 35:46.233
Hi, how're you doing?
- Hi. Good to see you.

35:46.233 --> 35:47.533
Look at you two,
you're both grown up,

35:47.533 --> 35:49.367
you're having fun,
you're living life.

35:49.367 --> 35:50.400
Look at how far
y'all have come.

35:54.000 --> 35:54.767
Just a joke.
- Oh, my God.

35:54.767 --> 35:57.133
- Peyton, you do not
look like yourself.

35:57.133 --> 35:58.333
- I like that.

35:58.333 --> 36:00.000
That's what I love
about Halloween.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
- Oh, my goodness.
- Hello.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.266
- Very impressed.
- Thank you.

36:04.266 --> 36:06.166
I like that you came
dressed up.

36:06.166 --> 36:09.100
- I never shirk my
responsibilities

36:09.100 --> 36:11.166
in the dress-up category.
- Good.

36:11.166 --> 36:13.433
- This might be the best party
I've ever been to.

36:13.433 --> 36:16.433
I've got Sour Patch Kids,
Nerds,

36:16.433 --> 36:18.166
unicorns.

36:18.166 --> 36:19.667
unicorn has
ever looked

36:19.667 --> 36:20.700
like they've been dipped--

36:21.734 --> 36:24.100
- You could tell I've poisoned
all of their minds.

36:26.033 --> 36:27.633
- What are you,
by the way?

36:27.633 --> 36:29.233
What do you
think I am?

36:29.233 --> 36:30.567
- Chick magnet.
- Yes!

36:30.567 --> 36:32.433
- I was going to say
duck magnet.

36:33.567 --> 36:35.567
- Hi.

36:37.133 --> 36:38.266
What is in your hand?

36:38.266 --> 36:39.667
- Starbursts.
- Oh, okay.

36:39.667 --> 36:41.567
I thought it was a blade.
That was really nice.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.300
- No, they--they weren't
for you, though

36:43.300 --> 36:44.567
- Oh, here.
- Here.

36:44.567 --> 36:46.567
- Give me a hug.

36:46.567 --> 36:48.400
I'm taking the high road
with Naomie

36:48.400 --> 36:51.667
because I fear
that if I don't,

36:51.667 --> 36:53.600
then we just
won't ever talk again.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.433
- Yeah, you look pretty.

36:56.433 --> 36:59.333
- I like your earring.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.600
But, this is
confusing as hell.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.567
All of a sudden,
nice Naomie is here.

37:03.567 --> 37:05.600
Dude, I'm telling you,
it's two different people.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.300
That was girlfriend/boyfriend.

37:09.166 --> 37:11.266

think that we were together.

37:11.266 --> 37:12.467
She's nuts.

37:12.467 --> 37:14.600

40:49.367 --> 40:51.767
why did you come here if
you did not wanna meet her?

40:51.767 --> 40:53.767

I came here for you.

40:53.767 --> 40:56.367
And how dare you
take her side over mine?

40:56.367 --> 40:58.266

It's just mean.

40:58.266 --> 41:00.533
Look, I was trying

41:16.500 --> 41:18.333
- Jesus Christ.

41:18.333 --> 41:21.266
- She usually stays by in
the closed doors of our house,

41:21.266 --> 41:23.533
where she feeds
on Craig's soul.

41:23.533 --> 41:25.000
I guess she had

41:33.266 --> 41:34.533

see yourself with.

41:34.533 --> 41:37.333

41:37.333 --> 41:39.300
Because it felt good

41:39.300 --> 41:40.433

41:44.033 --> 41:45.667

hooking up with another girl.

41:45.667 --> 41:47.433
What would I be lying about?

42:02.567 --> 42:04.400
I don't know why we even
try and talk anymore

42:04.400 --> 42:05.767
because it always ends up
like this.

42:07.533 --> 42:10.433

42:28.600 --> 42:30.734
Oh--oh, that's my family crest.

42:33.667 --> 42:36.600
- I think Austen and Chelsea
are gonna rekindle.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.066

we had a really nice time.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.066

and partying and...

42:46.433 --> 42:48.133
