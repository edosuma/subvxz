WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.373
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.373 --> 00:05.276
MRS. McCLUSKEY
HAD REACHED HER LIMIT.

00:05.276 --> 00:07.278
FIVE KIDS ARE TOUGH ENOUGH,
BUT YOUR HUSBAND MAKES SIX,

00:07.278 --> 00:10.641
AND THAT'S WHERE
I DRAW THE LINE.

00:10.641 --> 00:14.615
AN OLD FRIEND PAID ADAM
A VISIT.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.348
SYLVIA.
 AREN'T YOU GONNA
INVITE ME IN?

00:17.348 --> 00:20.291
AFTER YOU RUINED MY LIFE?
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:20.291 --> 00:23.724
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD THE TRUTH
ABOUT US.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.456
MIKE GOT HELP...

00:28.159 --> 00:30.801
FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE.

00:30.801 --> 00:32.703
(Gaby) VICTOR!
 VICTOR LASHED OUT...

00:32.703 --> 00:35.035
COME ON! GET UP!
 (grunts)

00:37.368 --> 00:40.141
AND CARLOS AND GABY...
 WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.643
SORRY. I GUESS
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

00:42.643 --> 00:45.146
FINALLY MET THEIR MATCH.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.148
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.

00:52.553 --> 00:57.088
(Mary Alice) IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

00:57.088 --> 01:00.531
KIDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
PLAYING IN THE PARK.

01:00.531 --> 01:05.096
HUSBANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN
DOING THEIR CHORES.

01:05.096 --> 01:09.170
WOMEN SHOULD HAVE BEEN
TENDING THEIR FLOWERS.

01:09.170 --> 01:12.843
BUT AT 2:26 THAT AFTERNOON,

01:12.843 --> 01:18.179
A TORNADO CAME
TO WISTERIA LANE...

01:18.179 --> 01:19.480
BRINGING WITH IT...

01:19.480 --> 01:20.481
(wind whistling)

01:20.481 --> 01:23.214
UNBELIEVABLE...

01:23.214 --> 01:25.516
DESTRUCTION.

01:25.516 --> 01:31.091
NO ONE COULD HAVE
ANTICIPATED IT...

01:31.091 --> 01:35.095
ESPECIALLY
GIVEN HOW THE DAY STARTED.

01:39.370 --> 01:41.432
SORRY.
CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN?

01:41.432 --> 01:45.276
I DON'T THINK
I HEARD YOU RIGHT.
 CARLOS AND I ARE BACK TOGETHER.

01:45.276 --> 01:47.608
GABY,
YOU JUST GOT MARRIED.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.641
AND SOME OF US GAVE YOU
VERY EXPENSIVE WEDDING GIFTS.

01:50.641 --> 01:52.643
UH, YOU WANT
THE FONDUE SET BACK? FINE.

01:52.643 --> 01:54.645
BUT DON'T ACT LIKE
IT COST A BUNDLE,

01:54.645 --> 01:57.188
'CAUSE IT CLEARLY DIDN'T.

01:57.188 --> 01:59.520
I GOT YOU THE FONDUE SET.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.352
OH. RIGHT. IT'S NICE.

02:01.352 --> 02:04.625
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS GONNA KILL EDIE.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.127
YOU WOULD THINK SO,
BUT NO SUCH LUCK.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.461
THAT VINDICTIVE HAG
TOLD VICTOR EVERYTHING.
 VICTOR KNOWS?

02:10.461 --> 02:13.634
YEAH, AND SEEING HOW HE'S
THE RICH MAYOR OF A SMALL TOWN

02:13.634 --> 02:17.608
WITH VARIOUS THUGS AND COPS
AT HIS DISPOSAL,

02:17.608 --> 02:20.241
CARLOS AND I
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SAFER

02:20.241 --> 02:22.243
IF WE GOT
THE HECK OUT OF DODGE.

02:23.414 --> 02:26.217
YOU'RE LEAVING FAIRVIEW?

02:26.217 --> 02:28.379
YEAH. THIS AFTERNOON.

02:28.379 --> 02:29.550
NO.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.882
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

02:31.882 --> 02:34.755
LOOK, WE'LL BE BACK...
SOMEDAY.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.758
WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT
TILL THIS ALL BLOWS OVER.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.260
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.263
I KNOW. THIS IS...
A LOUSY WAY TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

02:42.263 --> 02:46.166
AND I'M SORRY,
BUT I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.300
DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH I'M GONNA MISS YOU?

02:50.841 --> 02:53.674
HEY, YOU HEARD THE NEWS?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
A TORNADO JUST HIT
MOUNT PLEASANT,

02:55.676 --> 02:58.178
AND THEY THINK
WE COULD GET ONE, TOO.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.912
Y'ALL BETTER HEAD INSIDE
AND START GETTING READY.

03:04.715 --> 03:06.317
(sighs)

03:06.317 --> 03:09.220
UM, GO. YOU GUYS GO.

03:09.220 --> 03:11.722
YEAH, AND--AND WE DON'T NEED
TO SAY GOOD-BYE ANYWAY,

03:11.722 --> 03:13.394
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA
SEE YOU REAL SOON.

03:13.394 --> 03:16.467
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE
JUST THE WAY IT WAS.

03:18.229 --> 03:21.332
SADLY, THIS WAS NOT TO BE.
 OH!

03:21.332 --> 03:23.434
IN FOUR SHORT HOURS,

03:23.434 --> 03:27.207
ONE OF THESE WOMEN
WOULD LOSE A HUSBAND,

03:27.207 --> 03:30.481
AND ALL OF THEM
WOULD LOSE A FRIEND.

03:30.481 --> 03:32.983
BUT HOW COULD THEY
HAVE KNOWN THIS?

03:32.983 --> 03:35.486
(wind gusting)

03:35.486 --> 03:51.862
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

03:51.862 --> 03:53.364
BY NOON THAT DAY,

03:53.364 --> 03:56.607
A TORNADO WATCH WAS IN EFFECT
ON WISTERIA LANE,

03:56.607 --> 04:01.272
AND EVERY ONE OF ITS RESIDENTS
WAS PREPARING FOR THE STORM--

04:01.272 --> 04:06.347
EVERYONE, THAT IS,
EXCEPT GABRIELLE SOLIS,

04:06.347 --> 04:10.621
WHO WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT
 ANOTHERSTORM ON THE HORIZON.

04:10.621 --> 04:12.623
MAYOR LANG,
RECOVERING FROM HIS INJURIES,

04:12.623 --> 04:14.885
WILL REPORTEDLY BE RELEASED
FROM THE HOSPITAL TOMORROW.

04:14.885 --> 04:16.387
UNTIL THEN, THE DEPUTY MAYOR

04:16.387 --> 04:18.459
WILL BE COORDINATING
FAIRVIEW'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE

04:18.459 --> 04:20.461
AS THE CITY REMAINS
ON TORNADO WATCH.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.463
IT HAS BEEN OVER 50 YEARS...
 I TURNED OFF THE GAS

04:22.463 --> 04:24.465
AND LOCKED YOUR CAR
IN THE GARAGE.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.797
I'M GONNA GO GRAB MY PASSPORT
FROM THE SAFE-DEPOSIT BOX

04:26.797 --> 04:28.739
BEFORE THEY CLOSE THE BANK.
 ...WE SHOULD UNDERSTAND IS
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE

04:28.739 --> 04:30.901
THE POWER OF MOTHER NATURE.
 WHAT'S WRONG?

04:30.901 --> 04:33.304
THEY SAID VICTOR'S GETTING
OUT OF THE HOSPITAL... TOMORROW.

04:33.304 --> 04:34.805
RELAX.
WE'RE GONNA BE GONE

04:34.805 --> 04:36.807
BEFORE THEY GIVE HIM
HIS LAST SPONGE BATH.

04:36.807 --> 04:38.809
AND REMEMBER, THE ACCOUNTANT'S
DROPPING OFF THE PAPERS

04:38.809 --> 04:41.582
FOR MY CAYMAN ISLAND ACCOUNT.
 I CAN'T DEAL WITH THAT
RIGHT NOW. I'M PACKING.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.455
GABY, THOSE DOCUMENTS GIVE US
ACCESS TO $10 MILLION.

04:44.455 --> 04:45.456
MULTITASK.

04:45.456 --> 04:47.658
(scoffs)
 WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

04:47.658 --> 04:50.361
I TOLD YOU JUST TO PACK
THE ESSENTIALS.

04:50.361 --> 04:51.862
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

04:51.862 --> 04:53.764
IS THAT A BOA?

04:53.764 --> 04:56.296
CARLOS, IF YOU ARE
TAKING ME SOMEWHERE

04:56.296 --> 04:59.299
WHERE I DON'T NEED A BOA,
THEN I DON'T WANT TO GO.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.376
FINE. YOU COULD BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE SENSITIVE.

05:05.376 --> 05:08.379
I HAD TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO MY FRIENDS TODAY.
 YES, I'M SORRY.

05:08.379 --> 05:10.981
AND I SHOULD PROBABLY GO OVER
AND SAY SOMETHING TO EDIE.

05:10.981 --> 05:12.783
LIKE WHAT?

05:12.783 --> 05:14.515
"ROT IN HELL,
YOU MAGGOTY WHORE"?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.787
THAT WOMAN RUINED OUR LIVES.

05:16.787 --> 05:19.350
IF SHE HAD KEPT HER MOUTH SHUT,
WE WOULDN'T BE RUNNING AWAY.

05:19.350 --> 05:21.622
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T HELP
FEELING A LITTLE GUILTY.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.625
I MEAN, DO YOU EVER EVEN THINK
ABOUT WHAT WE DID TO EDIE?

05:24.625 --> 05:27.327
WHO CARES?! THANKS TO HER,
I'M GIVING UP MY HOME,

05:27.327 --> 05:28.629
MY FRIENDS,
HALF MY WARDROBE.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.961
SO DO ME A FAVOR AND NEVER
MENTION HER NAME AGAIN

05:30.961 --> 05:32.963
UNLESS IT'S FOLLOWED
BY THE PHRASE,

05:32.963 --> 05:34.465
"THAT CONNIVING SKANK."

05:34.465 --> 05:36.467
YATHINKYOU CAN DO THAT?

05:44.475 --> 05:45.976
(car engine starts)

05:52.122 --> 05:53.484
HEY, LYNETTE.

05:53.484 --> 05:56.056
HI. DID YOU HEAR
THEY DECLARED A TORNADO WATCH?

05:56.056 --> 05:58.389
SCARY, HUH?
 YEAH, WELL,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

05:58.389 --> 06:00.431
I'M READY FOR ANYTHING.

06:00.431 --> 06:03.434
IT'S SWEET OF YOU
TO DROP BY, THOUGH.
 OH, YEAH.
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:03.434 --> 06:04.465
OKAY.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.066
UM...

06:06.066 --> 06:08.038
CAN WE STAY
IN YOUR BASEMENT?

06:08.038 --> 06:09.500
WHAT?

06:09.500 --> 06:12.503
WELL, IF THIS TORNADO WATCH
GETS UPGRADED TO A WARNING,

06:12.503 --> 06:14.374
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A PLACE TO WAIT IT OUT.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.946
WHO EXACTLY IS "WE"?

06:15.946 --> 06:18.048
"WE"--ME, TOM, THE KIDS.

06:18.048 --> 06:20.551
THAT FAMILY YOU'VE
COME TO KNOW AND LOVE.

06:20.551 --> 06:22.152
ALL SEVEN OF YOU?

06:22.152 --> 06:23.484
YEAH.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.456
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

06:25.456 --> 06:27.458
I ONLY LOVE FOUR OF YOU.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.989
AND SECOND,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.521
NO WAY IN HELL.

06:30.521 --> 06:32.793
MRS. McCLUSKEY, PLEASE?

06:32.793 --> 06:35.065
IT'S A SMALL BASEMENT,
LYNETTE.

06:35.065 --> 06:36.727
I'VE ALREADY
INVITED IDA OVER.

06:36.727 --> 06:38.729
WE JUST WANNA PLAY
SOME CARDS

06:38.729 --> 06:41.432
AND WAIT THIS THING OUT
IN PEACE AND QUIET.

06:41.432 --> 06:43.934
WE CAN BE QUIET...

06:43.934 --> 06:45.906
RELATIVE TO THE STORM.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.908
LOOK, THERE'S A SHELTER
OVER AT 3rd AND GROVE.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.911
WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER THERE?
 THAT'S IN THE MIDDLE
OF SKID ROW.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.814
YOU THINK I WANT MY KIDS
AROUND A BUNCH OF WINOS?

06:53.814 --> 06:56.917
IDA'S OFF THE WAGON. IT'S NOT
GONNA BE MUCH BETTER HERE.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.520
I AM ASKING YOU AS A FRIEND.
PLEASE?

06:59.520 --> 07:03.854
(sighs) YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LET THIS THING GO, ARE YOU?

07:03.854 --> 07:06.857
THANKS. AND DON'T WORRY.
I'LL HAVE A TALK WITH MY KIDS.

07:06.857 --> 07:09.930
I PROMISE THEY'LL KEEP A LID
ON THE DESTRUCTION.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.533
RELATIVE TO THE STORM.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.204
YEAH. MM.

07:18.839 --> 07:22.573
DYLAN, WE'RE FINE.
IT'S JUST A TORNADO WATCH.

07:22.573 --> 07:25.946
NO. WE PAID A LOT OF MONEY
FOR THIS CLASS TRIP,

07:25.946 --> 07:28.448
AND I WANT YOU
TO STAY AND ENJOY IT.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.951
TELL JULIE
I'LL KEEP AN EYE ON HER MOM.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.688
GOTTA GO.

07:37.688 --> 07:39.930
(telephone beeps)

07:39.930 --> 07:42.933
(wind blowing)

07:48.499 --> 07:51.502
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

07:51.502 --> 07:54.645
I JUST CAME TO TALK
TO ADAM.

07:54.645 --> 07:56.106
I LIKE YOUR HAIR LONG.

07:56.106 --> 07:57.608
THIS IS HARASSMENT.

07:57.608 --> 07:59.610
I WILL CALL THE POLICE.

07:59.610 --> 08:01.181
I DON'T THINK SO.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.183
YOU'D HAVE TO TELL THEM
WHAT HAPPENED

08:03.183 --> 08:04.855
WITH ME AND YOUR HUSBAND.

08:04.855 --> 08:07.217
YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE
KNOWING ABOUT THAT.

08:07.217 --> 08:09.189
IN CASE YOU'D FORGOTTEN,

08:09.189 --> 08:11.692
ADAM WANTS
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

08:11.692 --> 08:12.893
OH?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.895
DIDN'T SEEM THAT WAY
YESTERDAY.

08:16.827 --> 08:20.701
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU
I STOPPED BY?

08:20.701 --> 08:22.132
UH-OH.

08:22.132 --> 08:25.135
I HOPE HE'S NOT STARTING
TO KEEP THINGS FROM YOU...

08:25.135 --> 08:26.677
AGAIN.

08:34.585 --> 08:37.888
HERE. I BROUGHT YOU A FEW THINGS
IN CASE THEREISA TORNADO.

08:37.888 --> 08:40.190
(chuckles) WOW.
TAPE, BATTERIES, A RADIO.

08:40.190 --> 08:42.192
HOW'D YOU KNOW
I NEED THIS STUFF?

08:42.192 --> 08:44.555
AN EDUCATED GUESS.

08:44.555 --> 08:46.557
HEY, ACTUALLY, UM,
SINCE YOU'RE HERE,

08:46.557 --> 08:49.560
I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE
IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA

08:49.560 --> 08:52.603
TO TELL ORSON ABOUT MIKE'S,
YOU KNOW...

08:52.603 --> 08:53.734
DRUG PROBLEM.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.738
GOOD, BECAUSE I ALREADY...
TOLD HIM.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.209
YOU DID? WHEN?

08:59.209 --> 09:00.611
LAST WEEK.

09:00.611 --> 09:03.614
I WAS AFRAID THAT MIKE
MIGHT GO TO ORSON FOR PILLS.

09:03.614 --> 09:05.876
I'M SORRY, SO...

09:05.876 --> 09:09.079
ORSON ALREADY KNOWS
ABOUT MIKE?

09:09.079 --> 09:11.852
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

09:11.852 --> 09:14.284
NO. NO, YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

09:14.284 --> 09:15.956
THANKS FOR THE SUPPLIES.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.764
I DON'T BELIEVE
A WORD YOU SAY.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.136
SO YOU STILL DON'T THINK
I SLEPT WITH ADAM?

09:26.136 --> 09:29.569
OF COURSE NOT.
 OH, WELL, LET ME
PAINT A PICTURE FOR YOU.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.971
ME LYING IN HIS ARMS,

09:30.971 --> 09:33.644
HIM WONDERING OUT LOUD
HOW HE ENDED UP MARRYING

09:33.644 --> 09:35.606
SUCH A COLD, HARD BITCH.

09:36.707 --> 09:38.078
(gasps)

09:39.179 --> 09:41.612
(scoffs)

09:45.856 --> 09:47.758
(car engine starts)

09:54.294 --> 09:57.197
KATHERINE,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

09:57.197 --> 09:58.729
I-I COULDN'T HELP
NOTICING--

09:58.729 --> 10:00.270
OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T.

10:01.832 --> 10:03.974
AND EVERYTHING'S FINE.
THANK YOU.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.857
HI THERE.

10:26.857 --> 10:29.700
I-I DON'T MEAN TO INTRUDE,
BUT ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:29.700 --> 10:32.703
NOT REALLY, NO.

10:35.866 --> 10:38.368
WOULD YOU LIKE
A NICE CUP OF TEA?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE
HAS EXTENDED THE TORNADO WATCH

10:54.654 --> 10:55.956
TO THE TRI-COUNTY AREA.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.788
FUNNEL CLOUDS HAVE BEEN SPOTTED

10:57.788 --> 10:59.790
IN THE COUNTIES
OF MANSFIELD AND WEBSTER...

10:59.790 --> 11:01.862
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE BEING SO NICE.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.794
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

11:03.794 --> 11:06.096
WELL, I KNOW KATHERINE,
AND BELIEVE ME,

11:06.096 --> 11:09.369
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY PERSON
I'VE SEEN HER REDUCE TO TEARS.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.371
DID YOU SEE HER SPIT ON ME?

11:11.371 --> 11:14.174
YES. THAT WAS UNFORTUNATE.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.107
IF YOU NEED
ANY ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP, I--

11:17.107 --> 11:19.850
NAH, I'M GOOD.

11:19.850 --> 11:22.713
SO, UM, WHY ON EARTH

11:22.713 --> 11:25.856
WOULD KATHERINE TREAT YOU
SO DREADFULLY?

11:25.856 --> 11:29.219
OH, SHE'S JUST MAD 'CAUSE
HER HUSBAND'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.024
REALLY?

11:34.024 --> 11:37.067
I WAS ONE OF HIS PATIENTS
BACK IN CHICAGO.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.899
FROM THE MOMENT WE MET,

11:38.899 --> 11:42.472
THERE WAS
THISINTENSEPASSION.

11:42.472 --> 11:45.705
WE TRIED TO FIGHT IT,
BUT WE COULDN'T.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.178
WELL, YOU'RE ONLY HUMAN.

11:48.178 --> 11:50.741
I KNOW HE'S MISERABLE
WITHOUT ME,

11:50.741 --> 11:54.244
EVEN THOUGH SHE TRIES
TO PRETEND THAT THEY'RE HAPPY.

11:54.244 --> 11:57.247
I MEAN, YOU'RE THEIR NEIGHBOR.
YOU THINK THEY'RE HAPPY?

11:57.247 --> 12:00.390
WELL, THEY SEEM...
CONTENT.

12:00.390 --> 12:02.793
WELL, THEY'RE NOT.

12:06.156 --> 12:08.158
IT WAS JUST
AN OBSERVATION.

12:08.158 --> 12:11.401
YEAH, A STUPID ONE.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.906
OKAY. (chuckles)

12:15.906 --> 12:18.468
THIS HAS BEEN... LOVELY.

12:18.468 --> 12:21.772
WE REALLY SHOULD, UM,
DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME.

12:21.772 --> 12:24.414
YOU THINK
I'M MAKING THIS UP?

12:24.414 --> 12:26.777
WE WERE LOVERS.
I CAN PROVE IT.

12:26.777 --> 12:30.020
HE HAS A SNAKE TATTOO
ON HIS RIGHT SHOULDER.

12:30.020 --> 12:32.182
ILICKED IT.

12:32.182 --> 12:35.886
BE THAT AS IT MAY, I REALLY
THINK YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

12:35.886 --> 12:39.529
NO ONE BELIEVES ME!
SHE HAS YOU ALL BRAINWASHED!

12:41.962 --> 12:44.264
SYLVIA,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:49.099 --> 12:51.802
SYLVIA, YOU NEED
TO COME OUT OF THERE.

12:51.802 --> 12:54.845
ASK ADAM!
HE'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH!
 WELL, ADAM IS NOT HERE,

12:54.845 --> 12:57.848
AND THERE IS A TORNADO COMING.
AND AS YOU MAY HAVE GLEANED

12:57.848 --> 12:59.850
FROM THE BATTERIES
AND BOTTLED WATER,

12:59.850 --> 13:02.913
THAT BATHROOM IS WHERE WE ARE
PLANNING ON RIDING IT OUT.

13:02.913 --> 13:05.415
SO WOULD YOU PLEASE BE A DEAR
AND COME ON OUT?

13:05.415 --> 13:07.287
GO GET ADAM!

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
(sighs)

13:10.790 --> 13:13.423
AND... OPEN WIDE.

13:13.423 --> 13:14.925
(drilling)

13:14.925 --> 13:16.426
ORSON, WE NEED TO TALK.

13:16.426 --> 13:19.429
(drilling stops)
 SUSAN. I'M WITH A PATIENT.

13:19.429 --> 13:21.101
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.904
HI. I'M HIS NEIGHBOR.
CUTE SHOES.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.806
WHY THE HELL
WOULD YOU GIVE MIKE DRUGS?
 UH...

13:26.806 --> 13:28.879
MRS. KOWALSKY...
(clears throat)

13:28.879 --> 13:30.941
WE'RE GONNA STEP OUT
FOR JUST A MOMENT.

13:30.941 --> 13:32.943
NO NEED. I'LL BE QUICK.

13:32.943 --> 13:34.244
'CAUSE I'M SURE YOU HAVE

13:34.244 --> 13:36.246
A VERY GOOD REASON
FOR GIVING MIKE PILLS

13:36.246 --> 13:38.949
WHEN YOU KNOW
THAT HE HAS A DRUG PROBLEM.

13:38.949 --> 13:40.991
SO... WHAT IS
YOUR VERY GOOD REASON?

13:42.422 --> 13:44.554
(sighs)

13:44.554 --> 13:47.958
OKAY, THIS MAY TAKE A WHILE.
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SPIT.

13:47.958 --> 13:52.062
MIKE WAS HAVING A LOT OF PAIN
WITH HIS SHOULDER.

13:52.062 --> 13:55.065
OH, OF COURSE, AND YOU KNOW
ALL ABOUT SHOULDER PAIN...

13:55.065 --> 13:56.937
BEING A DENTIST.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.468
I THOUGHT I WAS HELPING.

13:58.468 --> 14:01.011
BY GIVING PILLS
TO AN ADDICT?

14:01.011 --> 14:03.373
DOES THAT SOUND HELPFUL
TO YOU, MRS. KOWALSKY?

14:03.373 --> 14:04.975
(grunts)

14:04.975 --> 14:07.918
THANK YOU.
FINALLY, SOME SANITY.

14:07.918 --> 14:09.920
SUSAN, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.222
FINE.

14:12.222 --> 14:14.224
BUT YOU KNOW, IF I FIND OUT

14:14.224 --> 14:17.928
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN MIKE
SO MUCH AS A BREATH MINT,

14:17.928 --> 14:20.931
TRUST ME, THERE IS NOT
ENOUGH NOVOCAINE IN THIS OFFICE

14:20.931 --> 14:23.934
TO NUMB THE PAIN
I WILL INFLICT ON YOU.

14:23.934 --> 14:26.236
(sighs)

14:26.236 --> 14:29.239
(doorbell rings)

14:31.942 --> 14:33.443
HI, MISS BRITT.

14:33.443 --> 14:35.545
YOU NEED SOME BOTTLED WATER
BEFORE THE STORM HITS?

14:35.545 --> 14:37.877
WELL, THANKS, JEREMY.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.049
20 BUCKS.

14:39.049 --> 14:40.180
HOLD IT.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.183
YOU ARE PRICE GOUGING
RIGHT BEFORE A TORNADO?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.385
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE SOME MONEY.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.558
YOU REALLY WANNA
MAKE SOME MONEY?

14:48.558 --> 14:50.220
GO HIT UP GABRIELLE SOLIS.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.892
SHE HASN'T MET A PRICE TAG
SHE DIDN'T LIKE.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.394
I ALREADY TRIED.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.596
SHE AND MR. SOLIS
ARE MOVING.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.969
MOVING?

14:58.969 --> 15:02.072
YEAH. THEY'RE LOADING UP
THEIR CAR AND EVERYTHING.

15:02.072 --> 15:03.934
THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU?

15:03.934 --> 15:08.608
WELL, THEY PROBABLY DIDN'T
WANT A BIG EMOTIONAL SCENE.

15:11.541 --> 15:13.213
TOO BAD.

15:14.985 --> 15:17.988
(wind blowing loudly,
leaves rustling)

15:34.934 --> 15:37.937
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO, MIKE?
LEAVE 'EM IN YOUR TRUCK?

15:37.937 --> 15:40.940
I'M NOT GONNA SIT BACK AND WATCH
YOU SPIN OUT OF CONTROL.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.014
OUT OF CONTROL? HAVE I EVER
MISSED A MORTGAGE PAYMENT?
 WHAT?

15:44.014 --> 15:46.977
OR DISAPPEARED FOR DAYS ON END,
OR O.D.'d IN AN ALLEY?

15:46.977 --> 15:49.349
NO. I GO TO WORK EVERY DAY.
I HELP OUT AROUND THE HOUSE.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.681
I TAKE CARE OF YOU AND JULIE.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

15:51.681 --> 15:55.085
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
LET'S SEE. YOU LIED TO ME.

15:55.085 --> 15:57.087
UH, YOUR DRUG DEALER
ALMOST DATED MY DAUGHTER.

15:57.087 --> 15:59.559
YOU LIED TO ME SOME MORE,
AND THEN I FIND OUT THAT YOU

15:59.559 --> 16:01.631
HIT UP MY BEST FRIEND'S HUSBAND
FOR MORE PILLS.

16:01.631 --> 16:03.633
YOU'RE BLOWING THIS
OUT OF PROPORTION.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.596
AND YOU'RE KIND OF YELLING
AT ME--ALSO A PROBLEM.

16:06.596 --> 16:08.999
I'M SORRY. I'M IN PAIN.

16:08.999 --> 16:11.301
YOU MIGHT THINK
YOU HAVE THINGS UNDER CONTROL,

16:11.301 --> 16:13.303
BUT THEY'RE ONLY GONNA
GET WORSE...

16:13.303 --> 16:16.306
AND WITH A BABY ON THE WAY.
 I'M SICK OF EXPLAINING MYSELF.

16:16.306 --> 16:18.978
IF I NEED A PILL NOW AND THEN,
I'LL TAKE ONE.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.980
SO WHERE ARE THEY?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.513
I'M SERIOUS, SUSAN.
GIVE 'EM TO ME.
 FORGET IT.

16:23.513 --> 16:26.616
HEY, DON'T WALK AWAY
FROM ME! SUSAN!
 LET GO OF ME!

16:26.616 --> 16:29.589
AAH! OH!

16:42.472 --> 16:45.475
(woman) AND WE ARE NOW GETTING
REPORTS OF TWO MORE TORNADOES

16:45.475 --> 16:47.137
TOUCHING DOWN
OUTSIDE MOUNT PLEASANT.

16:47.137 --> 16:50.240
WE CAN CONFIRM 6 DEAD
AND MORE THAN 200 INJURED,

16:50.240 --> 16:52.742
WITH THE TOTAL ONLY EXPECTED
TO RISE...

16:52.742 --> 16:54.744
(indistinct conversations)

16:54.744 --> 16:56.746
MY WIFE NEEDS TO BE SEEN
IMMEDIATELY.

16:56.746 --> 16:58.748
SHE'S PREGNANT.
SHE FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

16:58.748 --> 17:00.320
ANY BLEEDING?
 UH, NO.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.522
CRAMPING?
 UH, I THINK
I JUST TWISTED MY ANKLE,

17:02.522 --> 17:05.194
BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO GET CHECKED OUT ANYWAY.
 SURE,

17:05.194 --> 17:07.696
BUT FOR NON-EMERGENCY CASES,
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG WAIT.

17:07.696 --> 17:09.759
WELL, SHE'S PREGNANT. DOESN'T
THAT MAKE IT AN EMERGENCY?

17:09.759 --> 17:12.762
SIR, I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO WAIT.

17:12.762 --> 17:15.135
IT'S OKAY.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.808
HOW COULD YOU NOT HAVE TOLD ME
SYLVIA WAS HERE?
 I WAS TRYING NOT TO UPSET YOU.

17:18.808 --> 17:20.310
WELL, YOU FAILED.

17:20.310 --> 17:23.313
AT LEAST IF YOU HAD WARNED ME,
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BLINDSIDED

17:23.313 --> 17:26.146
WHEN SHE SHOWED UP
ON OUR FRONT LAWN.
 I'M SORRY.

17:26.146 --> 17:29.079
LOOK, I'LL CALL THE POLICE.
I'LL GET A RESTRAINING ORDER.

17:29.079 --> 17:32.082
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET
THIS WOMAN OUT OF OUR LIVES.

17:32.082 --> 17:35.054
(loud knock on door)

17:41.161 --> 17:42.592
BREE. HELLO.

17:42.592 --> 17:44.134
HI, KATHERINE.

17:44.134 --> 17:46.166
COULD I BORROW ADAM
FOR A SECOND?

17:46.166 --> 17:50.100
I HAVE A...
SITUATION ON MY HANDS.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.076
SHE'S OVER THERE,
FIRST DOOR ON THE LEFT,

17:57.076 --> 17:58.578
AND PLEASE HURRY.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.581
WHAT IS SHE DOING THERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.583
I SAW HER WEEPING.
I WANTED TO HELP.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.256
YOU WANTED DIRT, AND I'LL BET
SHE TOLD YOU PLENTY.

18:06.256 --> 18:09.389
I CAN'T HELP HAVING
A SYMPATHETIC FACE.
 (cooing)

18:09.389 --> 18:11.161
(knock on door)

18:11.161 --> 18:14.224
SYLVIA? I NEED YOU
TO COME OUT HERE, OKAY?

18:14.224 --> 18:16.396
ADAM?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.198
IS THAT YOU, DARLING?

18:18.198 --> 18:20.170
DON'T CALL HIM THAT!

18:20.170 --> 18:23.403
KATHERINE?! I'M NOT COMING OUT
IF SHE'S HERE!

18:23.403 --> 18:25.405
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU ALONE
WITH MY HUSBAND.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.407
JUST COME OUT!
I'LL GET RID OF HER!

18:27.407 --> 18:28.738
LADIES.

18:28.738 --> 18:31.241
(scoffs)

18:31.241 --> 18:32.542
(knocks on door)

18:32.542 --> 18:34.544
(sighs)

18:37.187 --> 18:38.618
(sighs)

18:38.618 --> 18:41.351
(fussing)

18:43.623 --> 18:45.795
SO WHAT'D SHE TELL YOU?

18:48.898 --> 18:51.401
THAT SHE HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH ADAM.

18:51.401 --> 18:54.164
WELL, SHE DIDN'T.

18:54.164 --> 18:56.306
SHE WAS HIS PATIENT--

18:56.306 --> 18:59.739
A PATHETIC, LONELY WOMAN.

18:59.739 --> 19:03.713
ONE DAY, FOR NO OTHER REASON
THAN SHEER PITY,

19:03.713 --> 19:06.216
HE GAVE HER A LITTLE KISS.

19:06.216 --> 19:10.180
SYLVIA TOOK THIS TO MEAN
THAT THEY WERE IN LOVE.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.151
AND WHEN ADAM TOLD HER
OTHERWISE,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.653
SHE HAD A BREAKDOWN

19:13.653 --> 19:16.826
AND ACCUSED HIM
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.329
OH, MY GOD.

19:19.329 --> 19:20.790
WHAT DID YOU DO?

19:20.790 --> 19:23.263
WE SETTLED OUT OF COURT.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.265
I WANTED TO FIGHT IT,

19:25.265 --> 19:28.338
BUT ADAM WAS AFRAID
OF LOSING HIS LICENSE.

19:28.338 --> 19:30.340
OF COURSE,
WE LOST EVERYTHING ELSE--

19:30.340 --> 19:33.943
OUR HOME,
OUR... (chuckles) SAVINGS

19:33.943 --> 19:36.406
AND OUR FRIENDS.

19:36.406 --> 19:39.509
SO THIS IS WHY
YOU MOVED BACK TO FAIRVIEW?

19:39.509 --> 19:42.612
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
OUR FRESH START.

19:46.316 --> 19:48.918
SO...

19:48.918 --> 19:51.591
NOW YOU KNOW
OUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.

19:51.591 --> 19:55.725
WELL, KATHERINE,
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH...

19:55.725 --> 19:59.499
I WOULD'VE
SPIT IN HER FACE, TOO.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.535
(rattling)

20:05.535 --> 20:07.307
(rumbling overhead)

20:07.307 --> 20:10.280
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?
IS... IS THAT THE TORNADO?

20:10.280 --> 20:13.313
WORSE. IT'S THE SCAVOS.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.714
(door opens)

20:14.714 --> 20:17.787
(Lynette) HEY, WE'RE HERE!
 I KNOW!

20:17.787 --> 20:20.390
(Tom) ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
COME ON. STAKE OUT YOUR PLACES.

20:20.390 --> 20:24.394
(Preston) THIS IS OUR SPOT!
WE CALLED IT!
 (Parker) YOU CAN'T
CALL A SPOT THIS SOON!

20:24.394 --> 20:27.397
(Preston) CAN SO!
 (boys shouting indistinctly)

20:27.397 --> 20:28.898
(boy) OW, MY HEAD!

20:28.898 --> 20:31.901
(shouting continues,
loud banging)

20:33.833 --> 20:36.266
LYNETTE? I'M BEGGING.

20:36.266 --> 20:39.238
OH. SORRY.
KINDA GET USED TO IT.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.240
COME HERE.
GIVE THAT TO MAMA.
 (shouting continues)

20:41.240 --> 20:43.473
HEY, GUYS? COME ON NOW.

20:43.473 --> 20:45.745
KNOCK IT OFF. HERE YOU GO.

20:45.745 --> 20:49.579
AND... FIRST BASE, SECOND BASE,
THIRD BASE, SIT.

20:49.579 --> 20:52.352
WE GONNA HAVE
A NICE, QUIET TORNADO WATCH,

20:52.352 --> 20:55.425
AND NOBODY'S
GONNA CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS.
 IS THERE A CAT HERE?

20:55.425 --> 20:57.587
OH, YES. I BROUGHT TOBY.

20:57.587 --> 20:58.988
(meows)

21:02.031 --> 21:03.463
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

21:03.463 --> 21:05.795
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE'D BE A CAT.

21:05.795 --> 21:07.467
TOM'S REALLY ALLERGIC.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.399
IT SETS OFF MY ASTHMA.

21:09.399 --> 21:11.401
IDA, IS THERE ANY CHANCE

21:11.401 --> 21:14.404
THAT WE COULD
PUT LITTLE TOBY UPSTAIRS?

21:14.404 --> 21:16.806
UPSTAIRS?

21:16.806 --> 21:20.380
YEAH. HE'D BE VERY SAFE.
WE COULD PUT HIM IN A CLOSET.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.711
SURE.

21:21.711 --> 21:25.284
WHY DON'T WE PUT PENNY WITH HIM,
SINCE IT'S SAFE?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.686
(chuckles) WHAT?

21:26.686 --> 21:29.359
TOBY IS IDA'S BABY, LYNETTE.

21:29.359 --> 21:33.393
NO,TOBY'S AN ANIMAL,
AND MY HUSBAND, A HUMAN BEING,

21:33.393 --> 21:35.695
WILL GET VERY SICK
IF HE STAYS DOWN HERE,

21:35.695 --> 21:37.867
SO, PLEASE,
PUT THE CAT UPSTAIRS.

21:37.867 --> 21:40.029
LOOK,
I INVITED IDA TO COME HERE.

21:40.029 --> 21:42.031
YOU, I'M DOING A FAVOR FOR.

21:42.031 --> 21:44.033
IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY
WITH THE ACCOMMODATIONS,

21:44.033 --> 21:46.436
YOU'RE FREE TO LEAVE.

21:46.436 --> 21:48.438
HEY,
I'LL JUST STAY OVER HERE.

21:48.438 --> 21:50.440
(chuckles) MAY--MAYBE IT WON'T
GET ANY WORSE.

21:50.440 --> 21:51.841
NO, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

21:51.841 --> 21:53.613
KAREN, COME ON.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.645
SORRY. THE CAT STAYS.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.695
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

22:08.598 --> 22:12.462
(man) START HIM ON I.V.
 (woman) I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN ONE MINUTE!

22:12.462 --> 22:15.665
ARE YOU OKAY?
 YEAH, YEAH, I'M FINE.
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

22:15.665 --> 22:18.368
HOW LONG ARE THEY GONNA
KEEP US WAITIN'?

22:18.368 --> 22:21.010
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S ALL IT IS?
 (scoffs)

22:21.010 --> 22:24.514
HEY! HEY, WE WERE HERE
WAY BEFORE THESE PEOPLE.

22:24.514 --> 22:26.946
SIR, THEY'RE SEEING EVERYONE
ON AN EMERGENCY BASIS.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.519
THIS WOMAN IS HEMORRHAGING.
DANNY, CAN YOU TAKE HER IN?

22:29.519 --> 22:32.522
WHAT, YOU GOTTA SEE BLOOD
BEFORE YOU'LL TREAT SOMEBODY?

22:32.522 --> 22:36.025
MY WIFE'S PREGNANT, AND SHE
FELL DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
 I'M SORRY, BUT I'M GONNA
HAVE TO ASK YOU TO BE PATIENT.

22:36.025 --> 22:40.029
THESE PEOPLE ARE BLEEDING.
I CAN ABSOLUTELY WAIT.
 I'M JUST ASKING THEM
TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOU, OKAY?

22:40.029 --> 22:42.792
HELL, YOU COULD'VE DONE IT
WHILE YOU'RE STANDING HERE

22:42.792 --> 22:46.396
TALKING TO ME, RIGHT?
 SIR, WE'LL GET TO YOUR WIFE
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

22:46.396 --> 22:48.538
NOW PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.
 JUST TAKE A LOOK AT HER!

22:48.538 --> 22:50.570
GET THE HELL OFF OF ME!
 MIKE, STOP!

22:50.570 --> 22:53.903
WHOA! UHH!
 I NEED SECURITY HERE NOW.

22:53.903 --> 22:55.675
(both grunting)

22:55.675 --> 22:59.008
(woman)
HEY, WE NEED HELP HERE!

23:05.415 --> 23:07.386
(woman) DR. ROTH, BLOOD LAB 7.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.919
DR. ROTH, BLOOD LAB 7.

23:09.919 --> 23:11.791
HEY.

23:11.791 --> 23:15.465
WHEN YOU GONNA
LET ME OUT OF THESE THINGS?

23:15.465 --> 23:18.698
WHEN YOUR WIFE'S DONE
AND YOU'RE READY TO GO HOME.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.506
THE DOCTOR
SAID THE BABY'S FINE.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.807
OH, THANK GOD.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.509
YEAH.

23:31.080 --> 23:34.714
AND, UH, YOUR ANKLE?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.886
JUST A MILD SPRAIN.

23:41.821 --> 23:43.493
HOW YOU DOING?

23:43.493 --> 23:45.825
I'VE HAD BETTER DAYS.

23:45.825 --> 23:49.559
(breathing heavily)

23:54.764 --> 23:56.766
I AM SO SORRY.

24:02.772 --> 24:04.614
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

24:06.045 --> 24:08.217
I TALKED TO THE DOCTOR,
AND, UM,

24:08.217 --> 24:11.020
THEY HAVE A REHAB FACILITY
THEY WORK WITH.

24:11.020 --> 24:13.783
THANKS.

24:13.783 --> 24:17.857
I DON'T NEED REHAB.
I CAN KICK THIS MYSELF.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.859
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

24:19.859 --> 24:23.833
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT,
AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING WORSE.

24:23.833 --> 24:25.665
SUSAN, LOOK AT ME.

24:25.665 --> 24:28.738
I'M HANDCUFFED TO A CHAIR.

24:28.738 --> 24:30.900
I THINK
I'VE HIT BOTTOM HERE.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.705
I WILL FIX THIS.

24:35.705 --> 24:38.207
JUST NO REHAB.

24:40.049 --> 24:41.911
MRS. DELFINO?

24:41.911 --> 24:45.915
THE DOCTOR ASKED ME
TO GIVE YOU THESE, FOR THE PAIN.

24:56.926 --> 25:00.069
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

25:00.069 --> 25:03.272
I'VE KIND OF HAD
A ROUGH DAY HERE.

25:04.974 --> 25:06.536
NO.

25:06.536 --> 25:09.539
(whispers) SUSAN...

25:09.539 --> 25:12.882
(normal voice) I'VE JUST
GOTTA GET THROUGH THIS.

25:21.691 --> 25:24.223
NO.

25:24.223 --> 25:27.927
THERE'S NO TOMORROW.
IT'S NOW.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.929
YOU WILL QUIT THIS NOW.

25:29.929 --> 25:33.532
YOU WILL GO TO REHAB,
OR SO HELP ME, I WILL LEAVE YOU.

25:35.104 --> 25:39.839
I WILL TAKE THIS BABY,
AND I WILL LEAVE YOU.

25:44.914 --> 25:46.616
YOU WIN.

25:49.579 --> 25:50.880
I'LL GO.

25:56.686 --> 25:57.987
(gasps)

26:10.740 --> 26:15.344
(wind blowing loudly,
wind chimes ringing)

26:15.344 --> 26:16.676
GABRIELLE?!

26:16.676 --> 26:18.047
EXCUSE ME?

26:18.047 --> 26:20.209
SORRY. I'M IN A RUSH.

26:20.209 --> 26:22.211
MY WIFE'S
ALONE WITH THE KIDS,

26:22.211 --> 26:24.914
AND I HAVE TO GET HOME
BEFORE THE STORM HITS.

26:24.914 --> 26:26.986
THIS IS THE INFORMATION
CARLOS ASKED FOR.

26:26.986 --> 26:28.988
ABOUT WHAT?

26:28.988 --> 26:31.160
ABOUT
THE CAYMAN ISLAND ACCOUNT.

26:31.160 --> 26:33.963
DIDN'T HE TELL YOU
I WAS COMING?

26:33.963 --> 26:35.965
YEAH, OF COURSE HE DID.

26:35.965 --> 26:38.067
UH, HE SAID
YOU'D BE STOPPING BY.

26:38.067 --> 26:39.899
DUH.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.001
THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED
TO ACCESS THE MONEY.

26:42.001 --> 26:44.674
I WASHED MY HANDS OF THIS,
SO WHATEVER YOU DO,

26:44.674 --> 26:48.708
DON'T LOSE THAT FOLDER.
GOT IT?
 BELIEVE ME, I WON'T
LET IT OUT OF MY SIGHT.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.010
ALL RIGHT. NICE TO FINALLY
MEET YOU, GABRIELLE.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.783
YOU'RE JUST AS PRETTY
AS CARLOS SAID YOU WERE.

26:53.783 --> 26:55.244
OH, NO.

26:55.244 --> 26:57.787
I'M PRETTIER.

27:02.822 --> 27:04.994
(car door shuts)

27:04.994 --> 27:06.996
(engine starts)

27:17.406 --> 27:20.069
EDIE,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?!

27:25.675 --> 27:28.878
OH, CRAP!

27:28.878 --> 27:32.321
RESIDENTS ARE ADVISED
TO SEEK SHELTER AT ONCE.

27:32.321 --> 27:34.023
AGAIN, DO NOT EVACUATE.

27:34.023 --> 27:37.026
STAY WHERE YOU ARE
AND SEEK SHELTER IN A BASEMENT

27:37.026 --> 27:39.028
OR ANY WINDOWLESS ROOM.

27:42.131 --> 27:44.393
(breathing heavily)

27:44.393 --> 27:46.165
YOU OKAY?

27:46.165 --> 27:49.699
MY THROAT IS CLOSING UP.
I THINK I GOTTA GO UPSTAIRS.

27:49.699 --> 27:52.341
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

27:52.341 --> 27:54.173
(static crackling)

27:54.173 --> 27:58.007
(rattling overhead)

27:58.007 --> 28:00.149
YOU STAY HERE.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.065
(wind gusting)

28:16.065 --> 28:17.767
(grunts)

28:19.398 --> 28:22.171
EDIE, YOU THIEF!
OPEN THIS DOOR NOW!

28:22.171 --> 28:23.833
I'VE CALLED THE POLICE!

28:23.833 --> 28:25.134
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY,

28:25.134 --> 28:27.306
AND THEY ARE
GOING TO TASER YOUR ASS!

28:29.708 --> 28:31.710
OH!

28:43.222 --> 28:44.924
GABY?

28:53.903 --> 28:55.134
(wind howling)

28:55.134 --> 28:57.336
OH, GOOD. YOU'RE HOME.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.173
LYNETTE! WHAT--
 (Toby meows loudly)

29:04.173 --> 29:06.145
WHAT THE HELL
DID I TELL YOU?!

29:06.145 --> 29:08.747
I'M NOT GONNA SIT
AND WATCH MY HUSBAND SUFFOCATE.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.250
WELL, I DON'T WANT IDA TO WAKE
UP AND FIND HER CAT MISSING.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.482
KAREN, AFTER ALL OUR YEARS
OF FRIENDSHIP,

29:13.482 --> 29:16.185
HOW CAN YOU CHOOSE A CAT
OVER MY HUSBAND?

29:16.185 --> 29:17.857
YOU THINK WE'RE FRIENDS?

29:17.857 --> 29:19.088
OF COURSE.

29:19.088 --> 29:20.790
REALLY?

29:20.790 --> 29:24.193
YOU EVER STOP BY JUST TO SAY HI
OR INVITE ME FOR A CUP OF TEA?

29:24.193 --> 29:26.335
IDA DOES.
 WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:26.335 --> 29:29.268
I HAD YOU OVER FOR LEMONADE
LAST WEEK.
 WHILE I WAS DRINKING IT,

29:29.268 --> 29:31.270
YOU WENT TO THE STORE,
AND I WATCHED THE KIDS.

29:31.270 --> 29:34.503
FACE IT.
THE ONLY TIME WE'RE FRIENDS

29:34.503 --> 29:38.207
IS WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING.
 THAT IS NOT TRUE.
I GENUINELY CARE ABOUT YOU.

29:38.207 --> 29:41.210
YOU MEAN LIKE TODAY,
WHEN YOU CAME BY TO CHECK ON ME?

29:41.210 --> 29:44.253
OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU ONLY WANTED A BASEMENT,

29:44.253 --> 29:45.454
(both) OH!

29:45.454 --> 29:47.987
(meows loudly)
 DAMN IT, TOBY!

29:47.987 --> 29:50.219
HEY, HOLD IT! HOLD IT!
YOU CAN'T GO OUT THERE!

29:50.219 --> 29:53.362
THAT STUPID CAT IS
THE ONLY FAMILY THAT IDA'S GOT!

29:53.362 --> 29:55.995
NOW THIS IS WHAT FRIENDS DO!
 KAREN!

30:05.234 --> 30:08.007
GIVE ME THE DAMN FOLDER, EDIE!
 (singsong voice)
NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

30:08.007 --> 30:11.210
IT'S WORTHLESS TO YOU!
 (normal voice)
OH! YOU AND CARLOS

30:11.210 --> 30:14.413
ARE SCREWED WITHOUT IT,
AND THAT IS WORTH A LOT TO ME.
 GIVE ME MY MONEY!

30:14.413 --> 30:16.515
AH! (scoffs)YOURMONEY?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.547
CARLOS EMBEZZLED IT.

30:18.547 --> 30:20.990
OH, NOW YOU'RE MORAL
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

30:20.990 --> 30:22.992
YOU DIDN'T CARE
WHERE THE MONEY WAS COMING FROM

30:22.992 --> 30:25.294
WHEN YOU THOUGHT CARLOS
WAS GONNA SPEND IT ONYOU!

30:25.294 --> 30:28.227
OKAY, I'M NOT UNREASONABLE.

30:28.227 --> 30:31.931
CUT ME IN FOR, SAY, 60%,
AND I'LL GO AWAY.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.362
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

30:35.504 --> 30:37.506
(screams)

30:37.506 --> 30:39.208
(both grunt)

30:39.208 --> 30:41.240
NO! (growls)

30:41.240 --> 30:43.042
AAH!

30:45.174 --> 30:46.275
GET YOU!

30:46.275 --> 30:48.177
AAH!

30:48.177 --> 30:49.879
EDIE!
 GIVE ME THAT!

30:49.879 --> 30:51.951
NO! LET GO!
 NO, YOU!

30:51.951 --> 30:52.952
LET GO!

30:52.952 --> 30:56.185
YOU! AAH!
 OH! OH! NO!

30:56.185 --> 30:58.227
NO!

30:58.227 --> 31:00.289
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

31:00.289 --> 31:03.132
WHAT DID YOU DO, EDIE?!

31:03.132 --> 31:04.533
(thunder crashes)

31:04.533 --> 31:07.036
GET IN THE HOUSE.

31:07.036 --> 31:08.197
NOW!

31:08.197 --> 31:10.869
(panting) AAH!

31:10.869 --> 31:12.601
TOBY!

31:12.601 --> 31:15.144
TOBY.

31:15.144 --> 31:18.047
KAREN!
YOU GOTTA GET INSIDE NOW!

31:18.047 --> 31:20.309
HE'S RIGHT THERE!
 DAMN IT!

31:20.309 --> 31:23.112
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DIE,
SO DON'T MAKE ME DRAG YOU!

31:23.112 --> 31:25.384
OH, CRAP.

31:25.384 --> 31:28.887
(wind gusting loudly)

31:31.220 --> 31:32.922
(thunder crashes)

31:32.922 --> 31:34.223
OH! HURRY! GO! GO!

31:34.223 --> 31:36.065
(both) AAH!

31:36.065 --> 31:38.297
NO!
 COME ON! COME ON!

31:38.297 --> 31:40.069
COME ON, COME ON!
 (screaming)

31:40.069 --> 31:41.070
GET IN!

31:47.536 --> 31:49.008
(panting)

31:49.008 --> 31:51.410
I HAVE A CRAWL SPACE.
 (loud bang)

31:51.410 --> 31:54.283
I THINK WE CAN BOTH FIT.

31:54.283 --> 31:56.185
OH! (panting)

31:56.185 --> 31:58.547
YOU JUST THREW MY MONEY
IN A TORNADO.

31:58.547 --> 32:00.549
I AM NOT GETTING IN THERE
WITH YOU.

32:00.549 --> 32:03.392
FINE! THEN STAY OUT THERE
AND DIE.
 (glass shatters loudly)

32:03.392 --> 32:05.454
MOVE YOUR ASS!
 OH!

32:05.454 --> 32:07.496
COME ON, SYLVIA.

32:07.496 --> 32:09.999
PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR.

32:09.999 --> 32:12.531
SYLVIA.
 (front door opens)

32:12.531 --> 32:14.403
(wind gusting loudly)

32:14.403 --> 32:17.706
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE. WE NEED
TO GET INTO THE BATHROOM.

32:17.706 --> 32:20.009
WE CAN'T.
THERE'S A WOMAN IN THERE.

32:20.009 --> 32:22.511
WELL,
TELL HER TO HURRY IT UP.

32:22.511 --> 32:25.674
NO, NO, NO, SHE'S BARRICADED
HERSELF IN THERE.

32:25.674 --> 32:29.648
SHE'S A PATIENT OF MINE
WHO'S HAD A LITTLE MELTDOWN.

32:29.648 --> 32:34.523
JUST GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES.
 WE DON'T HAVE TIME. THERE'S
A FUNNEL CLOUD OUT THERE.

32:34.523 --> 32:36.225
(raps on door)

32:36.225 --> 32:39.428
SYLVIA!
OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!

32:39.428 --> 32:41.390
GO TO HELL!

32:41.390 --> 32:43.392
QUICK! IN HERE, IN HERE.

32:43.392 --> 32:46.235
COME ON.

32:46.235 --> 32:48.367
QUICKLY. QUICKLY.

32:50.039 --> 32:51.470
COME ON! HURRY UP!

32:51.470 --> 32:53.972
GO! GET IN, GET IN!
GET IN!

32:53.972 --> 32:58.277
UHH! HANG ON!
HANG ONTO THIS!

33:00.149 --> 33:03.152
(wind howling loudly overhead)

33:04.453 --> 33:06.115
(coughs)

33:11.390 --> 33:13.392
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

33:13.392 --> 33:15.024
WHAT?

33:15.024 --> 33:17.696
(creaking)

33:17.696 --> 33:20.399
I'M SORRY
CARLOS AND I LIED TO YOU.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.173
I KNOW WE HURT YOU,

33:24.173 --> 33:27.376
AND I WISH IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
THE WAY IT DID,

33:27.376 --> 33:29.678
AND I-I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT.

33:29.678 --> 33:32.381
WHY ARE YOU TALKING
LIKE THAT?

33:32.381 --> 33:34.383
WELL, I THOUGHT
JUST IN CASE WE--

33:34.383 --> 33:37.386
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU JUST SHUT THE HELL UP.

33:37.386 --> 33:39.488
WE'RE NOT DOING
DEATHBED CONFESSIONS HERE.

33:41.490 --> 33:43.492
WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS.

33:43.492 --> 33:46.625
I'M GONNA GO ON HATING YOU
FOR YEARS TO COME.

33:48.427 --> 33:49.728
YOU REALLY HATE ME?

33:49.728 --> 33:51.260
YES.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.368
(sighs) NO.

34:01.470 --> 34:03.072
(sighs) IT'S JUST THAT

34:03.072 --> 34:07.216
I REALLY LET MYSELF
FALL FOR HIM,

34:07.216 --> 34:09.518
WHICH WAS STUPID
BECAUSE I ALWAYS KNEW

34:09.518 --> 34:12.420
THAT HE'D GO BACK TO YOU.

34:12.420 --> 34:14.283
(rumbling, loud rattling)

34:14.283 --> 34:15.623
(both gasp)

34:15.623 --> 34:17.326
OH.

34:17.326 --> 34:20.289
WELL, I'M STILL SORRY,
THOUGH.

34:20.289 --> 34:23.391
(softly)
I SAID SHUT THE HELL UP.

34:27.835 --> 34:31.540
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE
BENJAMIN MIGHT NEED CHANGING.

34:31.540 --> 34:33.542
THAT WENT BEYOND
THE HYPOTHETICAL

34:33.542 --> 34:37.846
A GOOD TEN MINUTES AGO.
 WE'RE GIVING YOU SHELTER.
YOU COULD AT LEAST BE GRACIOUS.

34:37.846 --> 34:41.480
WE WOULDN'T NEED SHELTER IF
YOU HADN'T DRAGGED US OVER HERE.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.482
OH, SO NOW IT'S MY FAULT THAT

34:43.482 --> 34:45.784
THAT LUNATIC COMMANDEERED
OUR SAFE ROOM?

34:45.784 --> 34:48.817
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN DYING
TO KNOW OUR BUSINESS,

34:48.817 --> 34:51.860
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN IN THERE.
 CAN WE STOP POINTING FINGERS?

34:51.860 --> 34:53.562
THIS ISN'T BREE'S FAULT.

34:53.562 --> 34:54.862
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:56.625 --> 34:59.768
SORRY.

34:59.768 --> 35:02.601
BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY
I'M UPSET,

35:02.601 --> 35:05.304
HAVING THAT INSANE WOMAN
BACK IN OUR LIVES.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.605
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.878
I HAD TO LISTEN TO HER
BABBLE FOR AN HOUR.

35:09.878 --> 35:12.581
WHAT KIND OF THINGS
WAS SHE SAYING?

35:12.581 --> 35:15.284
SHE SAID THAT SHE AND ADAM
WERE LOVERS

35:15.284 --> 35:18.247
AND SHE COULD PROVE IT
BECAUSE HE HAD A TATTOO, AND...

35:19.788 --> 35:21.250
WHAT?

35:21.250 --> 35:23.552
SHE SAID HE HAD A TATTOO
ON HIS SHOULDER,

35:23.552 --> 35:26.555
WHICH I KNOW ISN'T TRUE BECAUSE
I'VE SEEN HIM AT THE POOL,

35:26.555 --> 35:28.257
AND I WOULD'VE REMEMBERED

35:28.257 --> 35:31.500
BECAUSE TATTOOED PEOPLE
MAKE ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

35:34.403 --> 35:36.605
DID SHE SAY WHAT KIND
OF TATTOO IT WAS?

35:36.605 --> 35:38.607
UM... A SNAKE.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

35:38.607 --> 35:40.839
HE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.

35:43.172 --> 35:44.873
HE DID...

35:46.345 --> 35:48.617
BACK IN CHICAGO.

35:50.519 --> 35:52.521
HE HAD IT REMOVED.

35:59.558 --> 36:01.460
OH.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.891
SORRY.

36:02.891 --> 36:04.363
KATHERINE...

36:04.363 --> 36:08.567
SO... THAT'S WHY WE SETTLED?

36:08.567 --> 36:11.570
WHY WE LOST EVERYTHING?

36:11.570 --> 36:13.502
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND--

36:13.502 --> 36:15.674
NO, I DO NOT.

36:24.213 --> 36:26.955
SORRY.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.389
(whispers) NOT HERE.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.522
NOT NOW.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.533
GABY!

36:44.533 --> 36:46.235
CHANGE OF PLANS!

36:46.235 --> 36:48.537
WE GOTTA GET
IN THE BASEMENT NOW!

36:50.679 --> 36:53.412
GABY?

36:53.412 --> 36:55.684
(sighs)
DAMN IT. WHERE ARE YOU?

37:05.724 --> 37:06.995
WHERE'S GABY?

37:06.995 --> 37:10.729
I THOUGHT SHE WAS WITH YOU.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.231
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS.

37:13.231 --> 37:15.734
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE
TO WAIT FOR HER TOGETHER.

37:30.719 --> 37:35.023
(sighs) DO YOU MIND
IF I SAY SOMETHING?

37:36.825 --> 37:39.828
LOOK, GABY AND I NEVER PLANNED
TO GET BACK TOGETHER, VICTOR.

37:39.828 --> 37:42.731
WE TRIED TO KEEP AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER.

37:42.731 --> 37:44.593
WE REALLY DID.

37:44.593 --> 37:46.595
BUT... I DON'T KNOW.

37:46.595 --> 37:49.598
IT'S LIKE WE'RE TWO HALVES
OF THE SAME PERSON OR SOMETHIN'.

37:49.598 --> 37:52.000
AND WHEN WE'RE APART, W...

37:52.000 --> 37:55.304
WE JUST AREN'T HAPPY,
WHICH IS WHY WE...

38:00.048 --> 38:03.652
WE NEVER SET OUT
TO HURT YOU, VICTOR,

38:03.652 --> 38:06.785
AND I'M SORRY WE DID.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.717
ARE YOU DONE?

38:08.717 --> 38:10.419
YEAH.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.296
(wind gusting loudly)

38:19.628 --> 38:22.371
COME ON, CARLOS!

38:22.371 --> 38:25.474
YOU BETTER GET IN THE HOUSE!

38:25.474 --> 38:27.476
YOU COULD GET HURT OUT HERE!

38:30.639 --> 38:33.942
(grunting)

38:39.748 --> 38:41.620
OH!

38:44.523 --> 38:48.657
(men resume grunting)

39:14.453 --> 39:16.725
UHH!

39:22.591 --> 39:24.062
(crunch)
 UHH!

39:24.062 --> 39:25.764
(metal clanks on ground)

39:28.897 --> 39:31.440
(thud)

39:35.574 --> 39:36.575
UHH!

39:36.575 --> 39:37.876
(thud)

39:41.109 --> 39:44.112
(creaking and rattling)

39:44.112 --> 39:47.085
(wind gusting loudly
in distance)

39:47.085 --> 39:49.858
ADAM!

39:49.858 --> 39:51.890
HELLO!

39:52.961 --> 39:54.723
WHERE IS EVERYONE?!

39:56.965 --> 39:58.897
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

39:58.897 --> 40:02.801
ADAM, I'M LEAVING!

40:02.801 --> 40:05.704
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO COME WITH ME,

40:05.704 --> 40:08.707
OR I'M GONNA TELL EVERYONE
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED!

40:12.541 --> 40:14.412
OKAY.

40:14.412 --> 40:18.146
YOU'VE MADE YOUR CHOICE!
HERE I GO!

40:19.748 --> 40:20.819
AAH!

40:20.819 --> 40:23.652
IT'S HERE.

40:23.652 --> 40:25.724
(gasps)

40:25.724 --> 40:27.826
AAH!

40:27.826 --> 40:28.757
OH!

40:30.198 --> 40:33.201
(crying)

40:41.910 --> 40:46.214
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

40:46.214 --> 40:47.846
(creaking)

40:47.846 --> 40:52.781
BUT THEN THE WINDS CAME
AND CHANGED EVERYTHING...

40:54.653 --> 40:57.856
AND NOT JUST THE HOUSES
AND THE LAWNS.

40:57.856 --> 40:58.927
(grunts)

40:58.927 --> 41:01.229
OH, MY GOD.

41:01.229 --> 41:04.793
THE PEOPLE HAD CHANGED, TOO.

41:04.793 --> 41:06.134
(cooing)

41:08.937 --> 41:11.570
WHILE THE STORM HAD RAGED,

41:11.570 --> 41:16.044
EACH OF THEM
HAD LEARNED SOMETHING...

41:18.877 --> 41:21.680
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP...

41:23.912 --> 41:25.884
(grunting)

41:25.884 --> 41:27.986
AND FORGIVENESS...

41:32.060 --> 41:34.492
AND REDEMPTION.

41:38.567 --> 41:43.602
AND SOME HAD LEARNED
THE HARDEST LESSON OF ALL...

41:48.276 --> 41:51.940
THAT LIFE IS ALWAYS FRAGILE

41:51.940 --> 41:53.982
AND VERY OFTEN...

41:53.982 --> 41:57.546
UNFAIR.

42:09.928 --> 42:12.931
(screaming)

42:17.235 --> 42:21.139
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

42:21.139 --> 42:24.913
TOM! HELP ME!

42:24.913 --> 42:27.145
HELP ME, TOM!

42:27.145 --> 42:29.147
(screaming indistinctly)
