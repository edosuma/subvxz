to make it feel fresh.

Yes!

What was I wearing when
you proposed to me?

36:53.546 --> 36:56.383
In detail.
I need all the details.

36:56.424 --> 36:57.801
I don't know
if this is right.

What is my go-to
dance move?

37:02.389 --> 37:04.307

this is what it would be called.

[ Buzzer ]

37:05.725 --> 37:08.019
I said, "Arm snap
with a shoulder nudge."

37:08.061 --> 37:09.187
Oh. Is it this one?

37:09.229 --> 37:10.814
When he's, like,
really excited about --

37:10.855 --> 37:12.399
Yeah, there you go.
He's, like, really excited,

37:12.440 --> 37:15.443
and then he does a little
shoulder nudge. It's great.

37:15.485 --> 37:16.945
No comment.

37:16.986 --> 37:19.030
We met...
On a blind date.

37:19.072 --> 37:20.865
I was 19,
and my friend, Joey, said,

37:20.907 --> 37:22.117
"You need to meet Derek."

37:22.158 --> 37:24.786
I had to talk her
into going that night.

37:24.828 --> 37:26.746
True.
Did I -- It's true.

37:26.788 --> 37:28.289
And she came back.

37:28.331 --> 37:32.085
She flops down on the bed,
and she said, "Mom,

37:32.127 --> 37:35.005
I think I just met the guy
I'm going to marry."

37:35.046 --> 37:38.216
And then, Jeff comes in.
"What? What did you just say?"

37:38.258 --> 37:39.718
* Can I get an amen? *

37:39.759 --> 37:41.720
We've been singing together
for about 10 years.

37:41.761 --> 37:43.304
We were like,
"Why are we doing this solo?"

37:43.346 --> 37:45.724
Probably the hardest thing to do
is select a band name,

37:45.765 --> 37:47.851
so we made it easy.
It's our last name.

37:47.892 --> 37:49.769
We have a flair of
traditional country.

37:49.811 --> 37:51.479
Honky-tonk.
With honky-tonk.

37:51.521 --> 37:54.149
And so, we hit
the bar scene, for sure.

37:54.190 --> 37:56.985
There was one night we got
to open for Little Big Town.

37:57.027 --> 37:59.529
It was like Christmas morning
that day for me.

37:59.571 --> 38:00.739
Hey, hey.
Can you hear me?

38:00.780 --> 38:02.157
I can hear you.

38:02.198 --> 38:03.283
We've never had a team,

38:03.324 --> 38:04.617
and we've kind of had to

38:04.659 --> 38:06.661
do a lot of things
on our own.

38:06.703 --> 38:08.204
-Good luck.
-Hey!

emotional about it

it just hit me.

doing this." You know?

Working with a coach

Ooh!
And someone in
a different genre

could have a lot of

I think you guys got to pick
Gwen just for that, that joke.

Hey, Blake, I have a question.
Just besides his mustache,

42:17.829 --> 42:19.247
what made you
turn around for us?

42:19.289 --> 42:21.166
I was in just
on Derek's voice

42:21.207 --> 42:23.043
before I even knew
that you were a part of it.
I love that.

42:23.084 --> 42:25.378
Because the arrangement of
that song, the first half of it,

42:25.420 --> 42:28.798
didn't sound exactly like
what Kenny and Dolly did.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.259
Country music
is all I've ever done.

42:31.301 --> 42:34.179
I mean, you hear me talking
right now. I can't help it.

It's what comes out --
It's fake.

of my mouth.

fun to work with you guys,

43:12.509 --> 43:14.177
especially because
whatever genre you're in,

43:14.219 --> 43:15.679
it doesn't really matter.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.305
At the end of the day,
we're trying to figure out,

43:17.347 --> 43:18.723
how are we going to connect you
with America?

I'm good at.

Am I allowed to even
say that now?

43:26.481 --> 43:27.857
Yeah.
Are they going to get mad?

43:27.899 --> 43:29.484
You wear the T-shirt
all the time.

43:29.526 --> 43:31.486
I wear that
shirt all the time.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:31.528 --> 43:33.446
I think I could be a good coach
for you guys.

43:33.488 --> 43:36.157
I've collaborated
with all kinds of musicians.

43:36.199 --> 43:38.576
It would be great.
And, yes, Blake's great,

43:38.618 --> 43:40.495
but why not consider?

43:40.537 --> 43:42.080
Thank you. It is really hard.
It is a hard choice, honestly.

the box a little bit.

that he told.

fruit on this show, man.

with one last thing?

That's more
low-hanging fruit.

43:58.430 --> 43:59.806
No, that's higher-hanging,
for sure.

43:59.848 --> 44:01.016
That was more
low-hanging fruit,

and you're not
making fun of her.

That is high-hanging. Like, you
needed a ladder for that one.

My name is Dominic Patrick.

1:11:27.078 --> 1:11:30.540
I am 37 years old,
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

1:11:30.582 --> 1:11:33.877
I come from a huge family.
My mom is one of 12.

1:11:33.918 --> 1:11:35.295
My dad is one of 10.

1:11:35.337 --> 1:11:36.963

Walk, you talk, you sing.

1:11:45.221 --> 1:11:48.808
At the age of 15
was when my life changed.

1:11:48.850 --> 1:11:51.519
I found out that
I was going to be a father.

1:11:51.561 --> 1:11:54.230
I remember just thinking, like,
"How am I going to make money?"

1:11:54.272 --> 1:11:56.983
So during that time,
I learned how to braid hair,

1:11:57.025 --> 1:12:00.403
cut hair, make clothes,
just to try to find $30

1:12:00.445 --> 1:12:04.366
to her a pair of sneakers
or $40 to get more formula.

1:12:04.407 --> 1:12:07.285
And so I stopped going to
high school, just got my GED,

1:12:07.327 --> 1:12:10.663
and just like focused on trying
to do my best with my daughter.

1:12:10.705 --> 1:12:14.084
Throughout my life,
I always had that tie to music.

1:12:14.125 --> 1:12:15.960
Even when my daughter was born,
I remember having to write

1:12:16.002 --> 1:12:18.213
a song about it
because I was so scared

1:12:18.254 --> 1:12:20.965
that I, like, literally had
to find my happy place there.

to see him doing this.

the type of person

to put everybody else's needs
before him and, like,

1:12:28.723 --> 1:12:30.225

everybody else is okay.

right back into music

1:19:43.992 --> 1:19:45.744
Uh, mm...

1:19:45.785 --> 1:19:46.870
Awkward.

1:19:46.911 --> 1:19:48.246
[ Laughs ]

1:19:48.288 --> 1:19:49.914
Are you singing
around Nashville?

1:19:49.956 --> 1:19:51.624
What are you
doing there?

1:19:51.666 --> 1:19:53.543
You know, since the pandemic,
I've not really gotten a chance

1:19:53.585 --> 1:19:56.421
to, like, do much of that,
and especially with school.

1:19:56.463 --> 1:19:58.256
Vanderbilt or Belmont or --
I'm at Belmont, yeah.

1:19:58.298 --> 1:19:59.466
Belmont.
Oh, cool.
What are you studying?

1:19:59.507 --> 1:20:00.717
Commercial music voice.

1:20:00.759 --> 1:20:02.093
Oh, that's cool.
That's cool.
Cool.

1:20:02.135 --> 1:20:03.511
With an emphasis in songwriting.

1:20:03.553 --> 1:20:05.180
What kind of music
do you want to sing?

1:20:05.221 --> 1:20:06.556
Soulful, pop.

1:20:06.598 --> 1:20:08.433
Kind of like
what you just sang.
Yeah.

1:20:08.475 --> 1:20:11.478
A Lizzo song
is no small feat.

1:20:11.519 --> 1:20:12.896
I was the last person
to turn around,

1:20:12.937 --> 1:20:14.731
because I know they're all
going to be like,

1:20:14.773 --> 1:20:16.107
[nasally voice] "Why were you
the last person to turn around?"

1:20:16.149 --> 1:20:17.859
Do we sound
like that to you?
Yeah.

1:20:17.901 --> 1:20:20.779
We sound Charlie Brown's teacher
to her, all of us do.

1:20:20.820 --> 1:20:24.199
That performance was like
95% of the way.

1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:26.451
I feel like on the notes
that you missed,

1:20:26.493 --> 1:20:28.328
I could see that maybe
you didn't support enough

1:20:28.370 --> 1:20:30.163
because nerves got
the best of you,

1:20:30.205 --> 1:20:31.831
which I can totally relate.

1:20:31.873 --> 1:20:34.459
Yeah.
I feel like I can
really help you execute.

1:20:34.501 --> 1:20:35.877
I know all of the tricks

1:20:35.919 --> 1:20:40.799
to basically get you
from a 95 to like a 99.9.

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:42.384
She doesn't want you to get
to 100 for some reason.

1:20:42.425 --> 1:20:43.843
I don't want you to get
to 100 because...

1:20:43.885 --> 1:20:46.262
Right.
...if you were 100,
you'd be a robot.

1:20:46.304 --> 1:20:49.099
We don't want robot.
We want human. We want emotion.

1:20:49.140 --> 1:20:53.144
Plus, also, I know the pop
landscape really, really well.

1:20:53.186 --> 1:20:55.230
I would love
to be your coach.

1:20:55.271 --> 1:20:56.398
Thank you.

1:20:56.439 --> 1:20:58.149
You got four
incredible....

1:20:58.191 --> 1:21:02.612
Well, I mean, three incredible
and super incredible people

1:21:02.654 --> 1:21:04.906
that you could choose from.
Hey.

1:21:04.948 --> 1:21:09.452
I see somebody that was born
to do what you're doing.

1:21:09.494 --> 1:21:12.706
It's like, finally,
you're on a stage,

1:21:12.747 --> 1:21:16.459
and now America got
to see you belt out

1:21:16.501 --> 1:21:17.836
the gift that
God gave you.

1:21:17.877 --> 1:21:19.671
You know, your stage presence
was great,

1:21:19.713 --> 1:21:22.048
but I think that's
one thing that I could
help you with, you know,

1:21:22.090 --> 1:21:24.843
just to bring out your own
personality and your power.

1:21:24.884 --> 1:21:28.430
I would love to have you
on Team Gwen.

1:21:28.471 --> 1:21:31.016
That song is such
a daunting song to take on,

1:21:31.057 --> 1:21:34.561
and you have such
a really powerful soprano voice.

1:21:34.602 --> 1:21:36.563
The higher part
was so compelling.

1:21:36.604 --> 1:21:38.398
It sounded like it should be
on the radio.

1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:39.733
It sounded special.

1:21:39.774 --> 1:21:42.152
The thing that's hard
about that song, though,

1:21:42.193 --> 1:21:43.486
is that rap singing part.
Yes.

1:21:43.528 --> 1:21:45.613
Like, I feel like
it trips everyone up.

1:21:45.655 --> 1:21:47.699
Yep.
I could just imagine
you singing songs

1:21:47.741 --> 1:21:49.242
that didn't require you
to do that part, and --

1:21:49.284 --> 1:21:52.120
Or changing it melodically
would be cool.
Exactly.

1:21:52.162 --> 1:21:54.539
You can work on your weaknesses,
work on things that are hard,

1:21:54.581 --> 1:21:57.500
but sometimes it's better
to just change it

1:21:57.542 --> 1:21:59.044
so it plays
to your strengths...
Yeah.

1:21:59.085 --> 1:22:02.297
...and make it so you don't
spend a second on stage

1:22:02.339 --> 1:22:03.673
where you're not
super confident.

1:22:03.715 --> 1:22:05.675
What you're looking for
in a coach is just someone

1:22:05.717 --> 1:22:08.928
who can find the ways to
improve on those little things

1:22:08.970 --> 1:22:13.350
so that you get to 100 --
not 99.9 -- but 100%.

1:22:13.391 --> 1:22:16.144
[ Chuckles ] And I'd
love to do that for you.

1:22:16.186 --> 1:22:18.021
Thank you.

1:22:18.063 --> 1:22:20.774
Camila may know
the pop landscape very well,

1:22:20.815 --> 1:22:22.150
but we happen to be
on "The Voice,"

1:22:22.192 --> 1:22:26.237
and I know this landscape
very, very well.

1:22:26.279 --> 1:22:28.990
I pushed my button three seconds
into you singing.

1:22:29.032 --> 1:22:32.577
Like, "This person's voice
matters,"

1:22:32.619 --> 1:22:34.287
because you stand out.

1:22:34.329 --> 1:22:36.206
She pointed at her notes.

1:22:36.247 --> 1:22:38.833
Did you notice that she was like
singing and pointing up there?
* Whoo *

1:22:38.875 --> 1:22:40.710
The last one, she, like,
tickled a little bit.

1:22:40.752 --> 1:22:43.004
She did one of these things,
like, to flip it around.

1:22:43.046 --> 1:22:45.048
That's Mariah.
You gotta point to it.

1:22:45.090 --> 1:22:46.049
Yeah.
[ Laughs ]

1:22:46.091 --> 1:22:47.342
You punch some of them,

1:22:47.384 --> 1:22:49.052
you slap some of them.
Literally unbelievable.

1:22:49.094 --> 1:22:52.055
I would be so excited
to have you on my team.

1:22:52.097 --> 1:22:53.973
Oh, my God.

1:22:54.015 --> 1:22:56.351
So, who are you going to pick
as your coach?

1:22:56.393 --> 1:22:58.728
Well, um...

1:22:58.770 --> 1:23:01.731
I thought that I knew,
and now I don't, so...

1:23:01.773 --> 1:23:04.401
Change your mind to me.

1:23:14.119 --> 1:23:16.871
I'm gonna go with John.

1:23:16.913 --> 1:23:18.415
Yeah!

1:23:18.456 --> 1:23:19.582
Nice one, buddy.

1:23:19.624 --> 1:23:22.794
Oh! I needed that.

Wow.

Welcome.
I'm so happy.

1:23:27.966 --> 1:23:29.509
John:
Morgan was really good.

1:23:29.551 --> 1:23:30.927
She's kind of, like,
shy and quiet

1:23:30.969 --> 1:23:32.804
when it came
to interacting with us,

1:23:32.846 --> 1:23:34.931
but when it came to singing,
I thought she was a risk taker,

1:23:34.973 --> 1:23:37.267
she was bold,
she has a big, powerful voice.

1:23:37.308 --> 1:23:41.062
This is your
Team Legend jacket.
Wow! Look at that.

1:23:41.104 --> 1:23:44.607

losing to Camila.

1:23:44.649 --> 1:23:46.776
She was on <i>my</i>team.

1:23:46.818 --> 1:23:48.611
I taught her everything
she knows.

1:23:48.653 --> 1:23:51.114
...so much.
Congratulations.

1:23:51.156 --> 1:23:53.742

Alright,
I needed that.

1:23:59.414 --> 1:24:00.915
I needed that.
Good job, John.
