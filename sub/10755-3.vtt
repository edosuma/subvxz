WEBVTT

00:09.500 --> 00:12.100
Well, we have time for
one more caller. Roz?

00:12.320 --> 00:14.620
We have Ed on line three.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.150
Hello, Ed, I'm listening.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.720
Ed? Ed?

00:23.600 --> 00:26.200
Well, we seem to have lost Ed.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.240
Let's take another caller.
On line four we have...

00:30.570 --> 00:32.570
Roz?

00:36.710 --> 00:38.910
Roz?

00:39.630 --> 00:41.830
We have...

00:42.010 --> 00:46.010
Eye... Lean.
Oh, Eileen.

00:47.900 --> 00:51.900
-Hello Eileen, I'm listening.
<i>-Dr. Crane...</i>

00:52.120 --> 00:54.389
<i>I've been very happily married
for twenty years...</i>

00:54.424 --> 00:57.420
<i>...and I wouldn't dream
of cheating but lately...</i>

00:57.620 --> 01:01.720
<i>...when we're making love I find
myself fantasizing about...</i>

01:01.930 --> 01:05.530
<i>-...people other than my husband.</i>
-Well, that's perfectly normal.

01:05.800 --> 01:09.900
It's quite normal to spice up one's
love life by imagining a tryst with...

01:10.270 --> 01:14.970
-...a sports figure or a movie star
or... <i>-Or a radio psychiatrist?</i>

01:16.600 --> 01:20.000
-Excuse me?
<i>-It's your voice, Dr. Crane.</i>

01:20.350 --> 01:23.302
<i>You must have the most
sensuous voice on earth.</i>

01:23.337 --> 01:26.150
Oh, I don't know, Eileen.

01:28.070 --> 01:31.870
<i>I've never seen your picture.
Would you mind describing yourself?</i>

01:32.000 --> 01:33.301
Oh, well I don't really
think that's appropriate...

01:33.336 --> 01:35.800
-I'll do it.
-Roz, I don't think...

01:36.120 --> 01:42.320
He's about six-one, with a granite jaw
and the broad shoulders of a marine.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.369
He's been wearing
his hair short lately...

01:44.404 --> 01:48.130
...but that only accentuates
his cobalt blue eyes...

01:48.430 --> 01:52.430
...his chiseled cheekbones
and his full, provocative lips.

01:53.810 --> 01:56.310
<i>Wow! Thanks Roz.</i>

01:56.810 --> 02:00.410
<i>And thank you, Dr. Crane.
I'll be thinking of you tonight.</i>

02:00.740 --> 02:03.540
<i>With any luck, twice!</i>

02:09.110 --> 02:14.210
Well, this is Dr. Frasier Crane feeling
a little red in his chiseled cheeks.

02:14.500 --> 02:18.500
Till tomorrow then,
this is KACL 780 AM.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.548
Roz, that was quite
a flattering description.

02:24.583 --> 02:27.440
You know, just out of curiosity...

02:27.730 --> 02:29.168
Were you just helping
that lady with her fantasy...

02:29.203 --> 02:31.930
...or do you really
see me that way?

02:32.530 --> 02:36.330
You really don't
know, do you?

02:37.630 --> 02:42.130
Frasier, I am so attracted
to you, I always have been.

02:42.320 --> 02:45.320
Your looks, your voice...

02:45.600 --> 02:48.196
You don't know how many times
I've wanted to strip naked...

02:48.231 --> 02:50.300
...and hurl myself
at that glass partition...

02:50.580 --> 02:53.580
...like a bug on a windshield.

02:54.500 --> 02:58.000
-Are you through?
-Well, ask a stupid question!

03:02.630 --> 03:04.730
All right Roz,
I will see you tomorrow.

03:04.930 --> 03:06.141
Hey, aren't you going
to the staff meeting?

03:06.176 --> 03:08.730
No, no, no, just tell them
that my aunt died.

03:08.940 --> 03:12.540
I'm off to her lawyerâ€™s now,
she put me in charge of her memorial.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.211
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Oh, don't be.

03:14.246 --> 03:17.750
She was a dreadful old harpy.
Life around her was miserable.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.446
That should look nice
on her headstone.

03:19.481 --> 03:22.260
Well, I don't mean
any disrespect but...

03:22.500 --> 03:24.583
...the entire time I knew her
she never said anything to me...

03:24.618 --> 03:27.200
...that wasn't scornful,
derisive or contemptuous.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.100
So how come she made you
in charge of her memorial?

03:30.300 --> 03:32.700
I was her favourite!

03:39.130 --> 03:41.530
-Evening all.
-Hello.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.120
Dad, I thought we
had an agreement.

03:46.350 --> 03:47.554
Eddie doesn't roll
around on the sofa...

03:47.589 --> 03:50.550
...and I don't throw him
in front of a bus!

03:52.240 --> 03:54.940
-Hello, Daphne.
-Oh, hello Dr. Crane.

03:55.150 --> 03:57.650
-Will you be joining us for dinner?
-If it's not too much trouble.

03:57.850 --> 03:59.438
It's Maris's night to
host her book club...

03:59.473 --> 04:01.450
...and they are more comfortable
not having a man there.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.240
Yes, apparently Niles makes
the ladies self-conscious.

04:04.420 --> 04:05.720
Well, I sat in on
the last discussion...

04:05.755 --> 04:08.420
...and Mrs. Esterbrook-Kindred
developed a facial tic...

04:08.620 --> 04:11.320
...every time she had to
say the word "Balzac."

04:14.350 --> 04:15.847
So how did it go with
Aunt Louise's lawyer?

04:15.882 --> 04:18.649
Did you get the old bat's
affairs straightened out?

04:18.860 --> 04:21.560
Ask her yourself.

04:26.550 --> 04:27.942
Apparently, it was
Aunt Louise's wish...

04:27.977 --> 04:29.950
...that Niles dispose of her ashes.

04:30.110 --> 04:32.100
Now the pressure's on me to
find the perfect place for her...

04:32.135 --> 04:34.310
...to rest for eternity. I haven't the
faintest idea what to do with her.

04:34.460 --> 04:37.160
Why don't you just
flush her down the toilet?

04:37.350 --> 04:41.150
-Mr. Crane, you can't do that!
-Why not? She loved the water.

04:42.870 --> 04:46.460
Oh, oh, that's it: the beach.
Oh, no, no, she hated seagulls.

04:46.970 --> 04:48.870
And vice-versa.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.980
Oh, oh, oh... no!

04:56.050 --> 04:57.130
It doesn't matter where I pick...

04:57.165 --> 04:58.621
...you know it's not going
to be good enough.

04:58.656 --> 05:01.250
Whatever I did she
always found fault.

05:01.540 --> 05:03.058
Remember when I used
to mow her lawn?

05:03.093 --> 05:06.740
Yes, what about the
Christmas tree I bought her?

05:07.030 --> 05:08.602
The ashtray I made at camp?

05:08.637 --> 05:12.530
"Is that the best you
can do? It wobbles!"

05:13.900 --> 05:17.200
I wish I had that ashtray now!

05:21.040 --> 05:24.940
-So when's the memorial service?
-It's two weeks after tomorrow.

05:25.140 --> 05:29.040
Lucky lucky me, her last request
was that I deliver the eulogy.

05:29.210 --> 05:30.748
Oh come on now, you can handle it.

05:30.783 --> 05:32.982
You just stand up there
and say a few nice things.

05:33.017 --> 05:33.910
There aren't any!

05:34.080 --> 05:36.582
Then just make them up. Everyone
lies a little in eulogies.

05:36.617 --> 05:40.370
No Daphne, I refuse to invent
virtues the woman didn't have.

05:40.570 --> 05:44.170
I'll just have to find something
good I can honestly say about her.

05:44.370 --> 05:49.370
Good luck! She was nothing but
a crabby, tight-fisted old pain.

05:49.650 --> 05:54.850
All she ever did was sit around
that house day after day watching TV.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.000
She kept that same old
cruddy furniture all her life.

06:03.170 --> 06:05.170
What?

06:07.480 --> 06:09.879
Oh, remember how she always
used to complain about the winters?

06:09.914 --> 06:10.980
Oh yeah.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.508
Every year she was going to take
a trip to the South Pacific.

06:13.543 --> 06:15.040
It was her big dream.

06:15.260 --> 06:17.260
But would she spend
the money? Nooooo.

06:17.490 --> 06:19.542
She just sat around
whining all the time...

06:19.577 --> 06:21.990
...about how she'd like
to be in a warmer climate.

06:22.170 --> 06:25.370
My guess is
she finally made it.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.474
I think it would be terribly
bad to go through life...

06:34.509 --> 06:37.960
...having a secret dream
and never fulfilling it.

06:38.350 --> 06:41.450
You'd never do anything silly
like that, would you Mr. Crane?

06:41.630 --> 06:44.330
-What're you talking about?
-Oh, I don't know.

06:45.340 --> 06:48.540
Perhaps a little something involving
a certain shoebox you keep hidden.

06:48.770 --> 06:51.570
-Shoebox?
-Forget it, it's not important.

06:51.860 --> 06:55.860
Oh fine, if you don't want to
talk about it, don't talk about it.

06:56.320 --> 06:58.958
It's only something you've given
over thirty years of your life to.

06:58.993 --> 07:01.220
Hey, I didn't tell you that so you
can go around blabbing it to everyone.

07:01.460 --> 07:04.160
-Tell us, dad, what's in the
shoe box? -Nothing, all right?

07:07.890 --> 07:10.090
All right, all right.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.860
It's just some songs I wrote...

07:15.200 --> 07:17.600
-...for Frank Sinatra.
-And he keeps them in his shoebox.

07:17.780 --> 07:20.580
I think your work here is done.

07:22.010 --> 07:23.910
Dad?

07:25.080 --> 07:28.680
Your mother and I used to
listen to Sinatra all the time.

07:29.150 --> 07:31.750
I know most of
his songs by heart.

07:32.970 --> 07:37.270
I guess I got it into my head one day
that I'd try to write a song myself.

07:37.650 --> 07:40.850
I'd be at the station
house or on a stakeout...

07:41.580 --> 07:45.880
...I'd get an idea and pretty
soon I had a shoebox full.

07:46.550 --> 07:51.350
I used to imagine your mother and I
seeing Frank in the stands in Vegas...

07:51.620 --> 07:54.320
...and he'd open the
show with one of my songs.

07:54.710 --> 07:57.210
Oh gee, dad, why did you
never tell us about this?

07:57.380 --> 08:00.630
-Because it is stupid. They
were no good... -Oh...

08:00.870 --> 08:03.055
And don't bother to ask,
I'm not letting you see 'em.

08:03.090 --> 08:06.270
Here they are. Just like
I told you, in his shoebox.

08:07.180 --> 08:11.580
-They're quite good if you ask me.
-"You are the song my soul would sing."

08:11.800 --> 08:16.200
-Very poetic. -"You make my
heart go ring-a ding-ding."

08:17.050 --> 08:19.850
That was during Frank's
ring-a-ding period.

08:20.070 --> 08:22.870
Lord, this shoebox
is full of them.

08:23.790 --> 08:28.690
-"I didn't mean to hurt her, she made
me lose my mind". -Hey, lemme see that!

08:29.270 --> 08:33.470
No, that's just some confession I took
from a guy. The lyrics are on the back.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.909
Anyway, I never finished them.
They were never any good.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.241
Well, except this. I gotta admit...

08:42.275 --> 08:44.900
...this has got "Frank Sinatra"
written all over it.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.037
"She's such a groovy lady."

08:47.072 --> 08:51.000
It's still got that nice
contemporary sound.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.900
So, why don't you send it
to old Blue Eyes?

08:55.120 --> 08:56.987
No, they're just words
scribbled on a piece of paper.

08:57.022 --> 09:01.020
The tune's in my head, I don't
know how to write it down.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.896
Well, Niles and I do. You've got
the tune in your head.

09:03.931 --> 09:05.875
Why don't you let us
write it down for you?

09:05.910 --> 09:07.490
We can finish this dream tonight.

09:07.710 --> 09:10.710
-It's just a dumb idea.
-Oh come on dad, really.

09:11.100 --> 09:14.400
Oh, you're wasting your breath
trying to convince him to do something.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.300
-Dad, come on.
-Come on now. Drop it.

09:19.800 --> 09:20.775
Yeah, you're probably right.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.800
You just sit there night
after night watching TV...

09:24.000 --> 09:25.773
...until the time finally comes
when we collect your ashes...

09:25.808 --> 09:27.400
...and scatter them over that chair...

09:27.610 --> 09:30.410
...where they'll probably go unnoticed.

09:34.370 --> 09:37.870
-All right, okay.
-You mean it?

09:39.020 --> 09:44.620
-OK, Niles.
-I get the piano.

09:45.790 --> 09:47.690
Okay, so boys...

09:47.880 --> 09:51.580
...the way I'm hearing the intro,
it goes something like this...

09:53.000 --> 09:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:04.500 --> 10:07.900
Of course, it is your piano.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.630
No, no, it goes:

10:25.000 --> 10:30.600
-So it's like... -No, no, come
on, this is the big finish.

10:32.230 --> 10:35.773
Dad, dad, in Niles's defense,
after four hours your...

10:35.808 --> 10:38.030
...sound a lot like your...

10:39.420 --> 10:43.220
-Right, Niles, let's just try
it again. -All right. Like this.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.310
Yeah! That's it.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.720
-Yeah. Let's hear the chorus
one last time. -OK!

11:10.210 --> 11:13.510
Niles. Dad, I don't
mean to criticise.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.601
You know that "heidi-hiedi?"

11:15.636 --> 11:18.900
It sounds like Cab Calloway
sung backwards.

11:20.410 --> 11:23.310
-You got any better suggestions?
-Er, yes, yes:

11:27.130 --> 11:29.030
No, no:

11:29.330 --> 11:33.430
"She makes the bravest
cat go 'fraidy!"

11:39.100 --> 11:44.000
I've got it: "She could have
slept with Warren Beatty!"

11:47.020 --> 11:51.320
-Very nice Daphne, no. -Well,
I'm sticking with my one, keep singing.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.950
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to quibble...

12:07.985 --> 12:11.620
...but it seems like her heart
is always going heidi-hiedi...

12:11.820 --> 12:14.420
...ringy-dingy,
or scooby dooby.

12:15.220 --> 12:20.120
-Look, I don't need another critic.
-Fine, perhaps a cardiologist?

12:22.530 --> 12:23.506
In all due respect...

12:23.541 --> 12:26.530
...I think I'm a little more
tuned in to what Frank likes...

12:26.730 --> 12:31.230
...and this is pretty close to
perfect the way it is. -Well?

12:31.540 --> 12:34.997
How about that! Thirty years
and I've finally finished it.

12:35.032 --> 12:36.940
Congratulations, dad.

12:37.640 --> 12:40.140
Thanks guys.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.540
Yeah, first thing tomorrow,
I'm mailing it to Frank's people.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.193
A little help from Lady Luck...

12:46.228 --> 12:50.550
...maybe they'll kick it upstairs
to the chairman himself.

13:05.250 --> 13:09.250
Oh Jeez! The service
is in an hour.

13:09.840 --> 13:11.433
Aren't you finished
with that eulogy yet?

13:11.468 --> 13:14.240
I can't even come up
with a first line.

13:16.250 --> 13:20.150
I got this old photo album, probably
one of her pictures might inspire me.

13:20.350 --> 13:22.050
How about this:

13:22.250 --> 13:26.500
"We all loved Aunt Louise,
even if the camera didn't!"

13:29.330 --> 13:33.230
Dr. Crane, you've been agonising
over this for two weeks.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.743
Perhaps it's time to start
bending the truth a little.

13:35.778 --> 13:38.210
No, I refuse to lie.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.191
I find it hard to
believe there isn't...

13:41.226 --> 13:43.630
...one nice story
you can tell about her.

13:43.830 --> 13:45.582
Maybe a cute little saying she used?

13:45.617 --> 13:46.827
I'm not sure that, "Stop crying...

13:46.862 --> 13:50.380
...or I'll give you something to
cry about" would qualify.

13:51.340 --> 13:55.540
-Where are you off to?
-Just going to go check the mail.

13:57.530 --> 14:00.530
I wish they'd just give him
an answer about that song.

14:00.750 --> 14:04.950
He must have made a hundred trips to
the mailbox during the past two weeks.

14:07.040 --> 14:09.740
Oh, bless you, Daphne. Are you sure
you're up to coming to the memorial?

14:09.960 --> 14:12.860
Oh, it's just a little cold.

14:13.550 --> 14:17.950
Besides, in my family, when there
was a funeral everybody went.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.144
I remember when
Grammy Moon passed on.

14:20.179 --> 14:22.410
My brothers had been off
on a three-day bender.

14:22.640 --> 14:25.003
They couldn't even stand on
their own - pissed as newts!

14:25.038 --> 14:28.240
But they crawled to that chapel
on their hands and knees.

14:30.290 --> 14:32.490
Very commendable.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.540
Yeah, well, they had an obligation.
They were the pallbearers.

14:39.540 --> 14:40.923
Hello, Daphne.
-Hello.

14:40.958 --> 14:43.840
Oh dear Lord, Niles, don't tell me you
haven't disposed of those ashes yet.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.866
Frasier, I have taken them
to a dozen locations.

14:45.901 --> 14:48.600
Fossy glade, a babbling brook,
a moonlit pond.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.500
None of them felt right,
what am I going to do?

14:51.770 --> 14:55.770
Well, winter's coming. The
sidewalks are always slippery.

14:57.540 --> 15:00.240
I'm having the same
problem with the eulogy!

15:01.040 --> 15:02.740
Oh, remember when this
photo was taken?

15:02.900 --> 15:05.900
the day Aunt Lousie took me to
Wilson's Meadow to fly a kite?

15:06.060 --> 15:08.337
It cost her 35 cents and
when it got stuck in a tree...

15:08.372 --> 15:10.160
...she made me climb up after it.

15:10.390 --> 15:13.290
I fell out, broke my
collarbone in two places.

15:13.570 --> 15:17.070
I think that's the only
time I saw her laugh.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.512
Frasier! I think she might
be happy there!

15:22.547 --> 15:24.850
Niles, I think you might be right.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.950
And even if she's not,
let's still do it.

15:28.570 --> 15:32.470
-Any news about your song?
-Nah.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.107
Listen, we better get started.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.345
All right. Perhaps
I'll have some inspiration...

15:36.380 --> 15:37.580
...on the way over in the car.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.750
And Wilson's Meadow is on the way.
We can stop and scatter the ashes.

15:40.950 --> 15:42.317
Well, this sounds like a family affair.

15:42.352 --> 15:44.950
-Maybe I'll take my car and meet
you there. -All right, let's go.

15:45.230 --> 15:46.995
Wilson's Meadow is
the perfect place.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.030
Aunt Louise, you've
tormented me for two weeks...

15:49.190 --> 15:52.390
and finally I've shown you
I can do something right.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.090
Oh, shut up!

16:11.570 --> 16:14.370
Here, here, yes, yes. Perfect.

16:17.480 --> 16:21.980
There's something rattling in here.
Like some great grisly morata.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.960
What am I going to
say at this memorial?

16:34.140 --> 16:38.640
-Don't ask me.
-You write lyrics, don't ya? -Right!

16:38.940 --> 16:41.340
Tell that to Sinatra!

16:44.590 --> 16:46.952
Oh, dad, it's a good song.

16:46.987 --> 16:49.990
I even caught myself singing it
in the shower this morning.

16:51.870 --> 16:55.070
Just because you haven't heard
anything yet doesn't mean...

16:57.980 --> 17:01.480
-...you have heard something?
-Yeah.

17:03.130 --> 17:06.829
-This morning they rejected it.
-Oh, I'm sorry, dad.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.490
Oh, it's okay. Sinatra must
get thousands of songs...

17:10.525 --> 17:12.800
...sent to him. What did I expect?

17:19.569 --> 17:23.869
-Well, you know, at least you gave it
your best shot. -Yeah, I guess.

17:24.650 --> 17:26.665
I mean, sure it would have been
nice to hear it sung...

17:26.700 --> 17:29.950
...but hey, I finished it, finally!

17:31.260 --> 17:32.734
Yeah, I walked down that highway...

17:32.769 --> 17:37.260
...and climbed that mountain,
and reached for the stars.

17:39.190 --> 17:42.290
Oh sure, now I get hot!

17:45.270 --> 17:49.270
-I can't open the damn urn!
-Oh, you are so helpless!

17:49.480 --> 17:53.880
-For Pete's sake, give it to me,
give it to me. -I made it loose.

18:13.980 --> 18:16.980
It looks like Louise's
whole rest home showed up.

18:17.170 --> 18:20.470
It must be "Liver & Onions
Day" in the cafeteria.

18:21.150 --> 18:22.659
Apparently when they heard
it was Frasier Crane...

18:22.708 --> 18:25.750
... from the radio speaking,
the whole rest home turned out.

18:25.990 --> 18:29.990
-Can't wait to hear what he
has to say. -Neither can he.

18:31.290 --> 18:34.990
He's huddled in the rectory still
working on his first sentence.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.821
How did the scattering go?
Were there any problems?

18:38.856 --> 18:41.000
No, nothing important.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.800
Dear friends, thank you
all for coming today.

18:55.080 --> 18:59.480
I know how very deeply your
friendship was treasured by Louise.

18:59.710 --> 19:03.210
We are privileged to have
with us her favourite nephew...

19:03.390 --> 19:07.890
...one of Seattle's most eloquent
speakers, Dr. Frasier Crane.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.880
Dr. Crane has spent the
last fortnight reflecting...

19:12.030 --> 19:14.730
...on what
Louise meant to him.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.030
Dr. Crane?

19:20.790 --> 19:23.590
Well, well, well.

19:24.650 --> 19:27.650
What can I say about Aunt Louise?

19:28.590 --> 19:31.090
What can
I say?

19:34.720 --> 19:37.220
Louise...

19:38.500 --> 19:41.100
...touched us all.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.320
In fact...

19:50.520 --> 19:53.020
...she touches us still.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.990
Aunt Louise...

20:03.890 --> 20:06.890
...loved to teach
us all lessons.

20:07.180 --> 20:11.680
You know, it's hard to picture
her without hearing her saying,

20:11.910 --> 20:14.910
"I'm going to teach
you a lesson."

20:19.270 --> 20:22.570
What particularly comes to mind...

20:23.410 --> 20:25.016
...by the very way
she lived her own life...

20:25.051 --> 20:29.110
...she taught us how important it is...

20:29.500 --> 20:32.400
...to pursue our dreams.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.700
Whether we succeed or fail...

20:35.890 --> 20:39.090
...what really matters
is that we tried.

20:39.890 --> 20:42.590
And now as we say
goodbye to Louise...

20:42.910 --> 20:47.110
...a phrase comes to mind. It was
coined by my very own father...

20:48.020 --> 20:51.020
"She's Such A Groovy Lady."

20:52.910 --> 20:57.310
I said, "She's Such A Groovy Lady."
