WEBVTT

00:07.175 --> 00:09.677
( knocks on door )

00:13.381 --> 00:16.784
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
I'M COMING, I'M COMING.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.757
WHO IS IT?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.493
Man:
DELIVERY.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.528
OKAY.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.866
MR. PRINCE.

00:32.966 --> 00:36.204
WHAT, YOU THOUGHT
IF YOU MOVED TO BROOKLYN
I WOULDN'T FIND YOU?

00:36.304 --> 00:40.341
WELL, IS--
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

00:40.441 --> 00:43.377
OKAY? WHAT, DID
YOU FORGET ALREADY?

00:43.477 --> 00:46.747
NO, OF COURSE
I DIDN'T.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.249
HOW COULD I EVER
FORGET THAT?

00:48.349 --> 00:50.218
NO ONE WANTS
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.586
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY THINKS
THEY CAN JUST RUN AWAY.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.223
- WELL, NOT ANYMORE.
- I'M REALLY CONFUSED.

00:55.323 --> 00:58.792
IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR.
HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.262
I GOT THE REPORT BACK
FROM THE NAVY.

01:01.362 --> 01:05.999
THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF A MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.570
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.406
BUT YOU KNEW MY SON
WASN'T READY TO FLY.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.775
YOU KNEW.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.810
AND YOU DID NOTHING
TO STOP HIM.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.680
NOW HE'S GONE.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.315
YOU STILL PRACTICING?

01:21.415 --> 01:24.118
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME INSIDE?

01:24.218 --> 01:26.854
IS THIS YOUR NEW OFFICE
WHERE YOU HELP PEOPLE,

01:26.954 --> 01:29.490
LIKE YOU DID ALEX?

01:29.590 --> 01:31.425
I WOULD-- I WOULD
NEVER GO IN THERE.

01:31.525 --> 01:35.062
MR. PRINCE, ALEX'S DEATH
WAS A TRAGEDY.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.830
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO IMAGINE WHAT YOU'VE--

01:36.930 --> 01:39.800
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO IMAGINE IT, MAN.
I WANT YOU LIVE IT.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.569
I UNDERSTAND YOUR RAGE.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.571
YOU UNDERSTAND NOTHING.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.340
YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING, DOCTOR--

01:46.440 --> 01:47.808
MAYBE YOU WILL
UNDERSTAND THIS.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.677
WHAT'S THIS?

01:49.777 --> 01:52.446
A LAWSUIT AGAINST YOU.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.648
I TOLD THEM I'D SERVE
THE SUMMONS MYSELF.

01:54.748 --> 01:57.485
( sighs )

01:57.585 --> 02:00.288
UM,

02:00.388 --> 02:02.423
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS,
PLEASE?

02:02.523 --> 02:04.024
IS THAT GONNA
BRING HIM BACK?

02:04.124 --> 02:06.126
NO, OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT
GONNA BRING HIM BACK.

02:06.227 --> 02:09.330
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S WHAT KILLED ALEX

02:09.430 --> 02:11.232
IN THE FIRST PLACE--
TALKING WITH YOU.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.867
I DID NOT KILL YOUR SON,
MR. PRINCE.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.069
OH, YEAH?

02:16.170 --> 02:18.839
TELL THAT TO HIS SON.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.910
I'M SORRY.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.813
OH, NO, THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.015
YOU'RE GONNA PAY.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.883
I WANT YOU TO PAY.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.962
( outside door slams )

02:42.062 --> 02:44.498
( exhales )

02:47.768 --> 02:50.604
( theme music playing )

03:09.089 --> 03:12.092
( people chattering,
phones ringing )

03:12.192 --> 03:16.564
( distant jackhammers
rattling )

03:41.422 --> 03:43.891
MR. WESTON,
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.894
THANK YOU.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.280
PAUL.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.682
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
HOW ARE YOU?

04:08.782 --> 04:10.651
I'M-- I'M FINE.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.354
IT'S MIA, ISN'T IT?

04:13.454 --> 04:17.024
I WASN'T SURE
YOU WOULD REMEMBER.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.959
OF COURSE
I REMEMBER.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.028
I'M SURE I'VE CHANGED.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.863
( chuckles )

04:22.963 --> 04:25.699
WELL...

04:25.799 --> 04:29.169
ACTUALLY, I HAD
AN APPOINTMENT

04:29.269 --> 04:31.339
WITH A MR. ELLIS.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.041
I KNOW. UNFORTUNATELY,
HE'S STUCK DOWN IN D.C.

04:34.141 --> 04:36.043
HE SENDS HIS APOLOGIES.
I'M COVERING.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.278
OH, OKAY.
WELL, THEN MAYBE

04:38.379 --> 04:40.180
I SHOULD WAIT
FOR HIM TO COME BACK.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.182
OH, YOU CAN, BUT HE
MIGHT BE A WHILE.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.917
AND I'VE ALREADY LOOKED
AT YOUR FILE.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.553
OH.

04:45.653 --> 04:49.657
BUT STILL,
GIVEN OUR HISTORY...

04:49.757 --> 04:51.459
GOD, PLEASE, PAUL.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.727
THE FIRST HEARING
IS IN EIGHT WEEKS.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.029
I THINK IT'S IN YOUR BEST
INTEREST TO GET STARTED.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.632
EIGHT WEEKS?
IS THAT ENOUGH TIME?

04:58.732 --> 05:01.201
WELL, EXACTLY.
LOOK, YOU'RE HERE.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.303
LET'S JUST DO
THE FIRST CONSULTATION.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.974
I WILL ASK SOME QUESTIONS.
YOU'LL ASK SOME QUESTIONS.
AND THAT'S IT.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.844
MR. ELLIS CAN SEE YOU
NEXT TIME IF YOU'D LIKE.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.748
- OKAY.
- GREAT.

05:17.618 --> 05:20.187
WELL, A BEAUTIFUL VIEW.

05:20.287 --> 05:22.823
YEAH, ALL THE TRAPPINGS.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.057
RIGHT.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.093
HAVE A SEAT.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.332
I'VE HANDLED A LOT
OF MALPRACTICE CASES.

05:32.433 --> 05:36.704
MALPRACTICE?

05:39.773 --> 05:42.142
I CAN IMAGINE
HOW DIFFICULT THIS
MUST BE FOR YOU.

05:42.242 --> 05:45.713
NO, I'M FINE,

05:45.813 --> 05:47.347
REALLY.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.418
MALPRACTICE?

05:50.518 --> 05:53.654
HOW DO WE--
HOW DO WE BEGIN?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.589
WE'LL START WITH SOME
PERSONAL INFORMATION,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.658
JUST TO VERIFY.
IS THAT OKAY?

05:57.758 --> 05:59.292
SURE SURE.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.696
- YOU'RE 53?
- YEAH.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.633
- YOU LOOK GREAT.
- THANK YOU.

06:05.733 --> 06:09.036
MEN ARE LUCKY LIKE THAT.
GOD, IT'S ANNOYING.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.607
YOU HAVE A B.A. AND AN M.S.
FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

06:13.707 --> 06:16.176
AND A PhD
FROM THE NEW SCHOOL.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.845
- THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
- THANK YOU.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.414
AND THEN, AFTER YOUR
NEW YORK INTERNSHIP,

06:20.514 --> 06:23.383
YOU JUST PICKED UP
AND MOVED.

06:23.484 --> 06:26.386
NO, THAT WAS
A FEW YEARS LATER.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.022
I ACTUALLY WENT
TO THE BALTIMORE INSTITUTE.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.659
RIGHT,
IN THE SUMMER OF '88,

06:31.759 --> 06:33.761
RIGHT BEFORE I STARTED
LAW SCHOOL.

06:33.861 --> 06:37.765
AND NOW YOU LIVE
AND WORK IN BROOKLYN.
WELCOME BACK.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.801
THANK YOU.
WELL, I JUST ACTUALLY
GOT BACK LAST SUMMER.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.102
I SEE.

06:42.202 --> 06:46.106
AND YOU'RE
RECENTLY DIVORCED?

06:46.206 --> 06:48.041
DOES IT SAY THAT
IN MY FILE?

06:48.141 --> 06:50.377
FROM YOUR
INSURANCE COMPANY--
IT'S THE FIRST YEAR

06:50.478 --> 06:53.046
YOU'VE CIRCLED THE "D"
ON THE FORM.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.750
THEN I GUESS
I AM D-VORCED.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.418
- AND THREE CHILDREN?
- YES.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.088
ARE THEY WITH YOU?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.727
ALL RIGHT, SO I ASSUME
YOU UNDERSTAND

07:06.827 --> 07:08.428
THE BASICS
OF THE LAWSUIT.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.163
YOU KNOW,
TO BE QUITE HONEST,

07:10.263 --> 07:12.432
I DON'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.902
OKAY, LET'S START
FROM THE TOP.

07:15.002 --> 07:18.405
YOU'RE BEING SUED BY YOUR
EX-PATIENT'S ESTATE.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.974
THEY CLAIM THAT YOU
SHOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD

07:21.074 --> 07:23.010
THAT MR. PRINCE
WASN'T READY TO FLY,

07:23.110 --> 07:25.412
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE ALERTED
THE NAVY TO HIS CONDITION.

07:25.513 --> 07:28.281
THEY'RE SUING YOU
FOR $20 MILLION...

07:28.381 --> 07:30.083
FUCKING HELL.

07:30.183 --> 07:33.353
...ONLY $3 MILLION
OF WHICH IS COVERED
BY YOUR INSURER.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.388
( exhales )

07:35.489 --> 07:38.626
- WOULD YOU
LIKE SOME WATER?
- UH-HUH, PLEASE.

07:38.726 --> 07:42.229
- OR MAYBE
SOMETHING STRONGER?
- WHAT?

07:42.329 --> 07:43.897
IT'S A JOKE.
IT'S JUST A BAD JOKE.

07:43.997 --> 07:47.467
SORRY I'M NOT
AT MY MOST JOVIAL.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.571
WELL, WHO WOULD BE?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.773
IN MY PERSONAL OPINION,

07:52.873 --> 07:55.943
THIS LAWSUIT
IS WITHOUT MERIT,

07:56.043 --> 07:59.312
BUT WE LIVE
IN A LITIGIOUS SOCIETY.

07:59.412 --> 08:03.450
SO THIS--
THIS FIRST HEARING--

08:03.551 --> 08:06.587
IT COULD JUST GET
THROWN OUT?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.989
IT COULD.
AND IT SHOULD.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.760
BUT THE THRESHOLD
TO ALLOW A CASE TO GO
TO TRIAL IS SUBJECTIVE.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.896
THERE'S THE LAW,
AND THEN THERE'S
THE JUDGE YOU DRAW.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.832
BUT YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A DIVORCE,
SO YOU MUST KNOW THAT.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.569
YEAH, BUT THE LAW IS
STILL THE LAW, ISN'T IT?

08:21.669 --> 08:25.372
YES, BUT YOUR PATIENT
WAS A YOUNG MAN,

08:25.472 --> 08:27.875
A FATHER, A WAR HERO.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.678
YEAH, WELL,
TO BE ABSOLUTELY HONEST,

08:30.778 --> 08:33.981
I DON'T THINK
THAT HE WOULD SEE HIMSELF
AS A WAR HERO.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.249
EITHER WAY,
A HOME-TOWN JUDGE

08:36.349 --> 08:38.986
MAY WANT TO GIVE HIS FAMILY
THEIR DAY IN COURT.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.822
BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WOULDN'T GO TO TRIAL.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.991
IT SHOULDN'T.
BUT IF IT DOES,

08:44.091 --> 08:46.794
JURIES CAN LET EMOTIONS
GET IN THE WAY
OF THE FACTS,

08:46.894 --> 08:49.563
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
TO SUICIDE CASES.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.865
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SUICIDE?

08:51.965 --> 08:55.468
ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU THINK ALEX
KILLED HIMSELF?

08:55.569 --> 08:57.404
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.506
BUT HIS ATTORNEYS
CLAIM THAT HE DID,

08:59.607 --> 09:01.374
AND THEY'RE OUT THERE
RIGHT NOW,

09:01.474 --> 09:03.510
DEPOSING EVERYONE
HE KNEW.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.646
AND THEY WILL FIND
PEOPLE WHO'LL SAY

09:05.746 --> 09:09.149
THAT HE SEEMED DEPRESSED
AND NOT HIMSELF.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.984
AND THE NAVY REPORT--

09:11.084 --> 09:13.687
WELL, OF COURSE
THE NAVY ARE GOING TO
ABSOLVE THEMSELVES.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.923
OF COURSE THEY ARE.
THAT'S NOT REALLY
A BIG SURPRISE.

09:16.023 --> 09:19.459
WELL, WE WILL BE
MAKING THAT POINT
IF IT GETS THAT FAR.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.395
BY THEN IT BECOMES
A CONTEST OF EXPERTS.

09:22.495 --> 09:26.099
WE'LL FIND PEOPLE
TO TESTIFY THAT YOU UPHELD
THE STANDARD OF CARE.

09:26.199 --> 09:29.737
RIGHT, AND THEY'LL PAY
PEOPLE TO SAY I DIDN'T.

09:29.837 --> 09:33.874
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW THIS CAN BE HAPPENING.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.343
PAUL, THE POINT IS,
THESE THINGS DO HAPPEN.

09:36.443 --> 09:38.245
AND THAT'S WHY
FIRMS LIKE OURS EXIST.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.514
YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY
CHOSE THIS FIRM
FOR A REASON.

09:41.615 --> 09:45.118
DID YOU FOLLOW
THE BOLINGER CASE?

09:45.218 --> 09:47.788
THE SURGEON WHO OPERATED
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF
SOMEBODY'S BRAIN?

09:47.888 --> 09:50.357
I MEAN, THAT GUY WAS
COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.926
THE FACTS WERE
AGAINST US.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.696
BUT I WAS HEAD COUNSEL
AND WE WON.

09:55.796 --> 09:58.498
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY

09:58.598 --> 10:00.167
CHOSE YOU BECAUSE
THEY THINK I'M GUILTY

10:00.267 --> 10:02.636
AND YOU GET
GUILTY PEOPLE OFF.
IS THAT IT?

10:02.736 --> 10:04.304
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

10:04.404 --> 10:08.776
MY POINT IS
I'VE HANDLED DOZENS
OF NEGLIGENCE CASES,

10:08.876 --> 10:12.479
MANY OF WHICH SEEMED
FAR WORSE THAN THIS ONE.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.648
I'M CONFIDENT
THAT WE CAN HELP YOU.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.717
( phone rings )

10:16.817 --> 10:18.652
I SAID NO CALLS,
HENRY.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.721
It's Mr. Nesky.

10:22.555 --> 10:25.826
DAD, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A MEETING.
ARE YOU OKAY?

10:25.926 --> 10:29.997
OH, I'M SO GLAD.
AND IT FITS?

10:30.097 --> 10:32.632
I KNOW MOM HATES GREEN,
BUT I LOVE YOU IN IT.

10:32.733 --> 10:36.136
OKAY, I HAVE TO GO.
I LOVE YOU. BYE.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.639
( pushes button )
NO MORE CALLS.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.009
I'M SORRY.
MY FATHER.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.476
IT'S OKAY.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.846
SINCE HE SOLD
THE CANDY STORE,
HE HAS SOME FREE TIME.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.715
A LOT OF FREE TIME.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.249
HE MUST BE
VERY PROUD OF YOU.

10:49.349 --> 10:53.954
I'VE COME A LONG WAY
FROM THE PULASKI BRIDGE.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.989
ANYWAY, LET'S KEEP GOING.
YOUR SESSION NOTES--

10:56.089 --> 10:58.792
YOU HAVEN'T SENT
THOSE IN YET. WE'RE GONNA
NEED THOSE RIGHT AWAY.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.328
I DON'T HAVE ANY NOTES.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.130
REALLY?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.598
I DON'T TAKE NOTES.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.368
OH. THAT COULD BE A BIT
OF A PROBLEM FOR US.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.003
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
A PROBLEM?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.439
LOTS OF THERAPISTS
DON'T TAKE NOTES.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.407
I MEAN, I START A SESSION--
I'M IN IT.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.844
I KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO BE KNOWN
ABOUT THE PATIENT.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.079
I DON'T NEED
TO WRITE IT DOWN.

11:19.179 --> 11:23.283
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE BECAUSE
OF SITUATIONS LIKE THIS,
YOU SHOULD.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.585
PROCESS NOTES
MAY NOT BE

11:25.685 --> 11:27.955
THERAPEUTICALLY IMPORTANT,
BUT LEGALLY--

11:28.055 --> 11:30.190
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING--
THAT A BAD THERAPIST
WHO TAKES NOTES

11:30.290 --> 11:32.860
IS BETTER
THAN A GOOD THERAPIST
WHO DOESN'T TAKE NOTES?

11:32.960 --> 11:35.228
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
- I'M NOT SAYING THAT AT ALL.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.798
AM I SOME KIND OF CRIMINAL
BECAUSE I NEVER TAKE NOTES?

11:37.898 --> 11:40.700
I WOULDN'T SAY NEVER, PAUL.
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU
TOOK THEM WITH ME.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.702
( phone ringing )

11:42.803 --> 11:46.139
CAN WE TAKE A BREAK?
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.078
DAD, NO, I'M GOOD.
( continues indistinct )

12:59.079 --> 13:02.082
SORRY. MY FATHER
DOESN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND

13:02.182 --> 13:04.784
THE CONCEPT OF
"SHE'S IN A MEETING."

13:04.885 --> 13:07.554
THOSE AREN'T MINE--
THE CHILDREN--

13:07.654 --> 13:09.923
IN CASE YOU WERE
WONDERING.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.424
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL KIDS.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.027
MY NIECES.
I NEVER MARRIED.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.197
IT'S FUNNY,
A LOT OF WOMEN LAWYERS
ARE LIKE SHRINKS--

13:17.297 --> 13:19.232
THEY DON'T PUT OUT
PERSONAL PHOTOS.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.801
BUT SINCE THEY'RE NOT
MY KIDS, I FIGURED--

13:23.003 --> 13:25.906
LET'S KEEP GOING.
WHERE WERE WE?

13:26.006 --> 13:28.308
I THINK THAT YOU WERE
REMINDING ME

13:28.408 --> 13:31.211
THAT I TOOK NOTES
WHEN I WAS YOUR THERAPIST.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.414
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN MY
THERAPIST IN 20 YEARS.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.748
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT IT UP.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.185
I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE
YOU UNCOMFORTABLE.

13:38.285 --> 13:41.754
I WAS KIND OF
UNCOMFORTABLE ANYWAY.

13:41.855 --> 13:45.258
EVERYONE WHO COMES
IN HERE UNDER THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES IS.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.127
LET'S GET BACK
TO SOLVING THIS.

13:47.227 --> 13:50.597
OKAY, YOU DIDN'T
TAKE NOTES.

13:50.697 --> 13:54.167
DID YOU CONSULT
WITH ANY COLLEAGUES

13:54.267 --> 13:55.969
ABOUT MR. PRINCE'S
TREATMENT?

13:56.069 --> 13:58.171
WELL, YES, ACTUALLY.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.840
I HAD WEEKLY SESSIONS
LAST YEAR

14:00.941 --> 14:03.710
WITH WHAT WE CALL
A SUPERVISOR.

14:03.810 --> 14:07.080
GREAT. WHAT IS
HIS OR HER NAME?

14:07.180 --> 14:11.084
GINA TOLL.
DR. GINA TOLL.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.653
OKAY, THAT'S A RELIEF.

14:13.753 --> 14:16.289
- IS SHE IN MARYLAND?
- MM-HMM.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.858
OKAY, GREAT.
WE'LL HAVE TO GET
A DEPOSITION FROM HER.

14:18.959 --> 14:22.095
IS THAT ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY?

14:22.195 --> 14:26.633
WE NEED TO AFFIRM THAT
YOU DID ALL YOU COULD
FOR MR. PRINCE.

14:26.733 --> 14:31.138
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'LL DO IT.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.906
WHY NOT?

14:33.006 --> 14:36.376
WELL, BECAUSE
OUR RELATIONSHIP

14:36.476 --> 14:40.513
HAS BEEN A LITTLE
STRAINED AT TIMES.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.016
OH. OVER THIS?

14:45.585 --> 14:47.487
DO YOU THINK
SHE MIGHT BELIEVE

14:47.587 --> 14:49.789
YOU'RE IN SOME WAY
CULPABLE?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.459
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW

14:52.559 --> 14:55.695
WHAT SHE MIGHT THINK.

14:55.795 --> 14:58.631
- IS THAT A YES?
- I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.642
LOOK, IN THE FIRST PLACE,

15:09.742 --> 15:13.846
ALEX WASN'T IN TREATMENT
THAT LONG.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.816
WHY NOT?

15:16.916 --> 15:21.054
THE-- THE PROCESS
OF SEPARATION

15:21.154 --> 15:24.324
IS QUITE COMPLEX.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.893
DID YOU REFER HIM
TO SOMEONE ELSE?

15:26.994 --> 15:28.328
HOW DID IT END?

15:28.428 --> 15:31.031
I DON'T SEE WHAT DIFFERENCE
THAT MAKES.

15:31.131 --> 15:34.401
OH, IT CAN MAKE
A LOT OF DIFFERENCE.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.005
WHY DID THE TREATMENT
END SO QUICKLY?

15:38.105 --> 15:39.339
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY QUICKLY?

15:39.439 --> 15:42.009
WELL, BEFORE THE PATIENT
WAS BETTER.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.011
IT WAS HIS CHOICE
TO LEAVE.

15:44.111 --> 15:48.348
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT LAST SESSION?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.117
HE SAID THAT--

15:50.217 --> 15:53.386
HE SAID HE WAS
READY TO FLY.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.922
AND HE TOLD ME NOT TO
SCREW UP HIS LIFE.

15:56.023 --> 15:59.692
AND YOU LET HIM GO?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.496
YES, I LET HIM GO.

16:03.596 --> 16:06.366
HIS ATTORNEYS ARE GOING
TO CLAIM THAT HE WASN'T
PSYCHOLOGICALLY FIT.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.701
SUICIDES OFTEN
SEEM BETTER BEFORE THEY
KILL THEMSELVES--

16:08.801 --> 16:11.404
UPBEAT AND DETERMINED
ONCE THEY HAVE A PLAN
IN PLACE.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.840
OF COURSE, SOMETIMES
WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY
DOING BETTER,

16:13.940 --> 16:15.675
THEY SEEM UPBEAT AND
PUT PLANS INTO PLACE.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.245
SO WHICH WAS IT
WITH ALEX?

16:18.345 --> 16:21.681
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.319
( sighs )

16:26.419 --> 16:29.522
LOOK, MY PATIENT DIED.
I'M HUMAN.

16:29.622 --> 16:34.227
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE DOUBTS.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.263
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THEM?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.231
NO, MIA,

16:38.331 --> 16:41.701
I DO NOT WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THEM.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.374
GOD, THIS--
THIS IS--

16:47.474 --> 16:49.309
IT'S KAFKAESQUE.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.445
PAUL, WE'RE
IN A BATTLE HERE.
IT'S NOT LIKE THERAPY

16:52.545 --> 16:55.848
WHERE YOU USED TO TELL ME
TO LOOK FOR THE GREY.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.550
NOT NOW.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.088
THE LAW IS WIN OR LOSE.
THERE IS NO SUBTEXT HERE.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.856
ACTUALLY,
I THINK THERE IS

17:03.956 --> 17:06.659
QUITE A BIT
OF SUBTEXT HERE.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.161
I DON'T FOLLOW YOU.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.463
YOU ASKED ME
IF ALEX'S TREATMENT
WAS TOO QUICK.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.200
YOU ASKED ME IF I
ENDED HIS THERAPY
BEFORE HE WAS BETTER.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.102
THAT'S JUST
DUE DILIGENCE.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.970
BUT IT COULD ALSO BE
THAT THE--

17:18.071 --> 17:22.275
THAT THE WIRES ARE GETTING
A LITTLE BIT CROSSED.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.412
IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT YOU ARE, IN FACT,

17:25.512 --> 17:28.215
EXPRESSING SOME OF
THE FEELINGS THAT MAYBE--

17:28.315 --> 17:30.517
BENNETT,
I'M IN A MEETING.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.052
YES, I KNOW, APOLOGIES.
I WANTED TO MEET DR. WESTON.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.089
- I'M BENNETT RYAN,
MANAGING PARTNER.
- PLEASED TO MEET YOU.

17:36.189 --> 17:39.292
I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
ON BEHALF OF MR. ELLIS.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.261
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I WAS THRILLED

17:41.361 --> 17:43.463
WHEN MISS NESKY
GRABBED THE CASE.
YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.132
BUT YOU KNOW THAT.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.734
I UNDERSTAND YOU TWO
GO BACK A WAYS.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.969
THANK YOU, BENNETT.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.339
OH, AND IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU NEED,

17:52.439 --> 17:55.142
PLEASE DON'T
HESITATE TO CALL.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.010
THANK YOU.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.946
- OH, MIA.
- YES?

18:00.046 --> 18:03.250
I HAVE TO RAIN-CHECK
OUR MEETING. SORRY.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.586
NO PROBLEM.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.589
IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.624
WHAT DO I THINK?

18:11.724 --> 18:15.195
- HE SHOULDN'T HAVE
WALKED IN HERE LIKE THAT.
- IT WAS FINE.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.398
ACTUALLY, IT WASN'T FINE.
I'M THE HEAD LITIGATOR.

18:18.498 --> 18:21.468
OKAY, HE'S
THE MANAGING PARTNER..

18:21.568 --> 18:24.637
THERE WAS
A LOT OF SUBTEXT
BEHIND THAT PERFORMANCE.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.406
THERE WAS?

18:26.506 --> 18:29.609
YEAH, BUT IT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.282
YOU KNOW, MIA,
I THINK--

18:35.382 --> 18:37.484
I THINK
WE SHOULD STOP NOW.

18:37.584 --> 18:39.752
WHEN MR. ELLIS
COMES BACK-

18:39.852 --> 18:41.488
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

18:41.588 --> 18:45.158
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT
WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.596
THAT'S FUNNY.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.964
- HAVEN'T WE
BEEN HERE BEFORE?
- HOW DO YOU MEAN?

18:52.064 --> 18:56.903
I WAS 22,
DEALING WITH A CRISIS,

18:57.003 --> 18:58.871
AND YOU JUST
DISAPPEARED.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.274
THAT'S WHAT
YOU REMEMBER?

19:01.374 --> 19:03.243
NO, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.011
YOU WERE THERE ONE WEEK
AND GONE THE NEXT.

19:05.111 --> 19:08.114
MIA, OBVIOUSLY I--

19:08.215 --> 19:10.617
I'M NOT A PERFECT
THERAPIST.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.886
BUT IF I-- IF YOU DID
FEEL ABANDONED,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.423
I APOLOGIZE.

19:16.523 --> 19:20.293
DON'T GIVE ME THAT
I'M-SORRY-IF-YOU-FEEL
BULLSHIT.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.663
I FELT ABANDONED
BECAUSE YOU ABANDONED ME.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.699
I'M SURE THAT WE TALKED
ABOUT THAT IN OUR SESSIONS.

19:26.799 --> 19:29.168
OH, DID WE?
MM-HMM.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.070
THEN HOW COME
THAT LAST DAY

19:31.170 --> 19:34.140
I SAT THERE
ON YOUR COUCH,
DEVASTATED?

19:34.241 --> 19:37.244
MIA, I WAS MOVING
WITH MY FAMILY
TO MARYLAND.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.880
I COULDN'T LEAVE.
YOU TOLD ME I HAD TO.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.551
I GAVE YOU
A GIFT THAT DAY.
DO YOU REMEMBER?

19:44.651 --> 19:48.087
WELL, I'M NOT
EXACTLY-- IT'S--

19:48.187 --> 19:50.290
NO.
YEAH.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.293
I NEVER EVEN HEARD
FROM YOU AFTER I LEFT.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.263
IT'S NOT USUAL
FOR THERAPISTS

19:56.363 --> 19:58.265
TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH
PATIENTS WHEN THEY--

19:58.365 --> 20:00.433
WELL, SOME DO,

20:00.533 --> 20:02.769
IF THE PATIENT
MEANS SOMETHING.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.170
MIA, OF COURSE
YOU MEANT--

20:04.271 --> 20:06.038
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.
FORGET IT.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.440
THIS IS STUPID.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.910
WE CAN STOP HERE.
LET'S STOP HERE.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.614
IT'S MY TURN.
I'M THROWING YOU OUT.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.317
MIA,

20:17.417 --> 20:21.421
BENNETT SAID THAT YOU
GRABBED MY CASE

20:21.521 --> 20:23.656
WHEN ELLIS
GOT DETAINED.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.158
I'M JUST CURIOUS

20:26.259 --> 20:28.628
WHY YOU THINK
YOU DID THAT.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.330
I DON'T KNOW.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.499
YOU KNOW, THE LAST TIME
I SAW YOU,

20:32.599 --> 20:34.367
YOU WERE JUST A KID.
I REMEMBER YOU WERE WORRIED

20:34.467 --> 20:37.337
THAT YOU WOULDN'T MAKE IT
THROUGH YOUR FIRST SEMESTER
OF LAW SCHOOL.

20:37.437 --> 20:40.206
BUT NOW LOOK AT YOU.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.309
LOOK AT WHERE YOU ARE.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.477
WHERE AM I?

20:44.577 --> 20:46.813
YOU'RE THE HEAD LITIGATOR--

20:46.913 --> 20:49.716
A WALL FULL OF CLIPPINGS.

20:51.784 --> 20:55.355
I THINK THAT YOU
WANTED ME TO SEE THAT--

20:55.455 --> 20:58.858
TO SEE THAT YOU ARE NOW
A SUCCESS.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.428
I'M A SUCCESS?
WHY?

21:01.528 --> 21:03.330
BECAUSE I WORK
IN A TALL BUILDING

21:03.430 --> 21:05.498
OR BECAUSE I WEAR
A PRADA SUIT

21:05.598 --> 21:07.600
OR BECAUSE I SUMMER
IN THE HAMPTONS

21:07.700 --> 21:10.470
AND GO TO ALL
THE GALA OPENINGS
AT THE FUCKING MET?

21:10.570 --> 21:13.406
YEAH, I MADE IT
THROUGH LAW SCHOOL

21:13.506 --> 21:16.376
AND ALL THE WAY
TO THE TOP FLOOR

21:16.476 --> 21:19.178
WITH THE BEAUTIFUL VIEWS

21:19.278 --> 21:20.580
AND THE WINDOWS
THAT DON'T OPEN

21:20.680 --> 21:22.782
AND THE FUCKING JACKHAMMERS
THAT NEVER STOP.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.652
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DO
WHEN I WIN A CASE,

21:25.752 --> 21:28.821
ONE OF THOSE HOPELESS ONES
THAT ONLY I WOULD TAKE?

21:28.921 --> 21:32.659
I GO OUT AND I GET DRUNK
WITH MY GAY SECRETARY,

21:32.759 --> 21:36.162
AND THEN I STUMBLE HOME
TO MY ONE-BEDROOM CONDO

21:36.262 --> 21:39.666
AND I PRAY
THAT I CAN FALL ASLEEP.

21:46.305 --> 21:51.143
WERE YOU HOPING
TO SHOW ME

21:51.243 --> 21:54.414
BOTH HOW WELL
YOU'VE DONE

21:54.514 --> 21:57.083
AND HOW SAD YOU ARE?

21:59.652 --> 22:02.755
I SEE YOU SITTING THERE

22:02.855 --> 22:04.290
AND ALL I CAN THINK--

22:04.391 --> 22:07.360
I CAN'T STOP THINKING

22:07.460 --> 22:10.062
IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
THIS WAY.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.764
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

22:11.864 --> 22:16.035
DON'T TELL ME
YOU FORGOT THAT TOO.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.108
NO.

22:22.208 --> 22:25.878
NO, ME NEITHER.

22:32.218 --> 22:34.954
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

22:36.188 --> 22:38.224
I'LL GET YOUR FILE
TO MR. ELLIS.

22:38.324 --> 22:39.692
HE'LL DO
AN EXCELLENT JOB.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.961
HE'S ALMOST
AS GOOD AS I AM.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.563
IT'S FINE.

22:43.663 --> 22:45.932
I'LL MAKE SURE ELLIS
GIVES IT TOP PRIORITY.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.167
THANK YOU.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.569
LOOK, I--

22:49.669 --> 22:51.804
AND I REALLY DO HAVE
TO KICK YOU OUT.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.840
I HAVE A MEETING
WITH ANOTHER CLIENT.

22:53.940 --> 22:55.675
I UNDERSTAND.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.647
THANK YOU.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.585
MIA...

23:33.345 --> 23:36.182
( music playing )
