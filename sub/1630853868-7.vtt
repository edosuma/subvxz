WEBVTT

00:10.875 --> 00:11.875
I'm all right.

00:13.291 --> 00:14.166
It…

00:14.666 --> 00:17.041
It's strange, Bunny.

00:17.125 --> 00:18.833
The Eldwyrm souls.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.791
I can feel them, hear them.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.833
Th-- They're singing.

00:24.916 --> 00:27.333
The harmony of creation.

00:27.416 --> 00:28.458
Papa.

00:28.541 --> 00:33.250
The original process was somewhat
more complicated and needlessly violent.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.416
I just wanted to know how it worked.

00:35.500 --> 00:36.958
I needed to know.

00:37.041 --> 00:38.708
I'm not here to stop you.

00:39.375 --> 00:41.166
I'm here to teach you.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.333
Reach out with your mind.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.666
Find the Eldwyrms.

00:56.208 --> 00:57.458
They have mass…

00:58.416 --> 00:59.458
form.

01:00.416 --> 01:02.666
It's almost as though I could touch them.

01:03.375 --> 01:04.500
<i>Because you can.</i>

01:05.166 --> 01:06.500
<i>Draw them to you.</i>

01:09.458 --> 01:10.500
<i>It's quite safe.</i>

01:12.375 --> 01:16.875
<i>Were the moment to come,
it would be too late for them to stop you.</i>

01:17.458 --> 01:20.375
Now imagine the world
as you would have it be.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.083
But first, you must let go of this one.

01:24.166 --> 01:25.666
I don't understand.

01:26.416 --> 01:28.125
Let go of all hope for it.

01:28.208 --> 01:29.666
Just…

01:29.750 --> 01:31.125
wish it away.

01:40.916 --> 01:41.791
<i>It hurts.</i>

01:43.041 --> 01:44.208
<i>It hurts.</i>

01:47.250 --> 01:48.625
I can't.

01:48.708 --> 01:50.416
But this is what you want.

01:50.500 --> 01:52.000
You have the power.

01:52.666 --> 01:56.041
Wish everything you love
into non-existence.

01:56.875 --> 02:03.416
Know that you will do this again and again
until you master the Forge.

02:03.500 --> 02:06.541
I don't want this. No one could want this.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.500
No one, at all.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.625
So ends the lesson.

03:09.750 --> 03:10.833
Davion.

03:12.708 --> 03:14.250
Hey, come back to me.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.583
We were walking, you stopped.

03:16.666 --> 03:19.500
I thought maybe you saw an air dragon,
or-- or several air dragons,

03:19.583 --> 03:22.833
and then I realized, nope. Clear blue sky.

03:23.875 --> 03:26.375
This "I'm an Eldwyrm" thing
is getting a little weirder every day.

03:26.458 --> 03:29.208
I saw something. Someone.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.166
A girl.

03:30.791 --> 03:32.291
<i>She didn't say a word.</i>

03:32.375 --> 03:34.583
I don't even know what she wanted.

03:34.666 --> 03:37.458
Oh, well, that's better?

03:37.541 --> 03:39.333
It's definitely something.

03:39.416 --> 03:41.750
Well-- Wait,
a-- another mystery girl?

03:42.458 --> 03:43.708
How is this a thing?

04:20.166 --> 04:23.208
Oh, Marci, I-- I love you.
I'm sorry, I love--

04:32.416 --> 04:36.166
Turn your eyes,
Her Imperial Majesty Mirana,

04:36.250 --> 04:38.250
God Empress of the Sun.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.875
Gaze into her light.

04:41.541 --> 04:42.833
All hail, Her Majesty!

04:47.375 --> 04:50.041
You're concerned, I know. Don't be.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.625
Listen, it's hard to explain.

04:53.416 --> 04:57.666
When this happened in the other world,
it didn't happen this way.

04:58.333 --> 04:59.750
But I am glad.

05:01.333 --> 05:05.541
I am thankful you are here
to share this day with me.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.125
Another encouraging result.

05:35.208 --> 05:39.166
Containment may be achievable
with a fraction of the Dragons' power.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.916
A drop of water from the ocean.

05:43.916 --> 05:45.541
You're worried, I know.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.083
The Forge is making it worse.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.000
But…

05:52.083 --> 05:54.166
nothing makes it better.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.916
So be it.

06:00.875 --> 06:03.208
The world is crumbling around us.

06:03.291 --> 06:07.041
Kingdoms fall, civilizations disappear,

06:07.125 --> 06:10.875
entire regions
have been rendered uninhabitable.

06:10.958 --> 06:13.916
There will be more Haupstadts
in our future,

06:14.000 --> 06:15.500
but we will hold the line.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.916
We will fight, lend aid, and rebuild.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.583
Most of that land

06:20.666 --> 06:22.416
is far beyond our borders.

06:22.500 --> 06:25.666
We can't be everywhere,
not even where we might be wanted.

06:25.750 --> 06:26.875
I think Luna is trying to say

06:26.958 --> 06:29.208
that the Imperial Army
is stretched thin as it is.

06:29.291 --> 06:31.458
Armistice or no armistice.

06:31.541 --> 06:34.291
No, you're right.
An army isn't the answer.

06:34.375 --> 06:39.500
But an alliance, cooperation
with the Principality of Shadow.

06:41.125 --> 06:44.208
Old hatreds will only bring ruin.

06:44.833 --> 06:49.125
You might want to tell the elves that.
They attacked us.

06:49.208 --> 06:52.375
I know who attacked who.

06:52.458 --> 06:55.250
It's a new world out there.

07:09.958 --> 07:13.041
We are aware of the service
Dragon Hold provides,

07:13.125 --> 07:16.500
and we hold you all in the highest esteem.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.875
But in the absence of a crisis,

07:18.958 --> 07:21.958
I'm afraid I cannot offer
an immediate audience.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.458
That-- That's what I'm telling you.

07:24.541 --> 07:26.583
-Uh, shit.

07:26.666 --> 07:29.458
I see you know one another. Shall I?

07:29.541 --> 07:31.875
Wait, I have to talk to her.

07:33.416 --> 07:34.583
Look, I get it.

07:34.666 --> 07:36.833
We didn't exactly part as friends,

07:36.916 --> 07:39.000
but there are a few things
the Princess needs--

07:39.083 --> 07:40.458
Empress.

07:40.541 --> 07:42.500
The Empress needs to know.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.166
Let me explain this in another way.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.833
A lot has changed.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.666
Uh, trust me, you don't get used to it.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.250
-Dragon Knight.
-Your Majesty.

08:02.333 --> 08:03.500
Mirana.

08:04.375 --> 08:05.416
It's good to see you.

08:08.583 --> 08:11.708
It's so strange, I feel like me.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.500
The me I've always been.

08:13.583 --> 08:17.500
But I have other thoughts, other memories.
They're like…

08:18.333 --> 08:19.458
I-- I don't know.

08:19.541 --> 08:22.250
-A stranger's dream.
-Yeah.

08:22.333 --> 08:26.875
The things that matter to me,
to him, I mean, the other Davion.

08:26.958 --> 08:30.208
-The things he felt…
-You feel them, too.

08:30.291 --> 08:32.666
I look at you and…

08:32.750 --> 08:35.875
Gods, none of that is real, is it?

08:35.958 --> 08:38.333
That was his life, not mine.

08:38.416 --> 08:40.416
"The Flesh Illusion", Slyrak says.

08:41.958 --> 08:45.333
Does this feel like an illusion?

08:47.916 --> 08:52.791
I want you to know, if it had been me,
if I were the one, not you,

08:52.875 --> 08:55.166
I wouldn't have done
anything differently than you.

08:55.250 --> 08:58.708
-Not a single godsdamn thing.
-I made my peace.

08:58.791 --> 09:00.333
I'm making a life.

09:00.416 --> 09:04.625
Then you really don't know
what's happening to the moon, the world.

09:04.708 --> 09:07.333
Oh, this happened
on the first world long ago.

09:07.416 --> 09:10.750
We survived. This world will survive.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.333
No, it won't.

09:12.416 --> 09:17.500
In a few months, all of this,
this entire planet, it's all gone.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.208
Like it or not, that's the truth.

09:21.125 --> 09:23.833
And I don't think
you'll like my solution much better.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.500
The flowers
no longer follow the moon.

09:31.583 --> 09:32.875
They're dying.

09:32.958 --> 09:35.791
It is their nature.
We can't change it.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.291
But we can want to.

09:37.375 --> 09:40.208
Yes. I'm waiting for the truth.

09:40.958 --> 09:42.208
One empathizes.

09:43.625 --> 09:46.625
There are no secrets in this valley,
not from me.

09:46.708 --> 09:51.166
And the Forge is no proper subject
for continued experimentation.

09:51.250 --> 09:52.666
Not even by you.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.250
I don't see the harm.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.500
If you saw no harm,

09:55.583 --> 09:57.833
you would not have tried
to keep it secret.

09:57.916 --> 10:00.625
You don't even care
to ask me what I've learned.

10:00.708 --> 10:01.708
Clearly nothing.

10:01.791 --> 10:05.791
We don't have to remake the universe
or defeat The Ancients.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.583
-We just have to manage the problem.
-Manage it?

10:08.666 --> 10:11.375
We tap the dragons rather than kill them.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.000
We use just enough of their power

10:13.083 --> 10:15.416
to bolster the entity
holding back the Ancients,

10:15.500 --> 10:17.958
and repair the physical structure
of the moon.

10:18.041 --> 10:20.875
-We buy time for a permanent solution.
-Impossible.

10:20.958 --> 10:23.541
You could at least pretend
to give it some thought.

10:23.625 --> 10:27.000
Filomena, the Forge can kill you.

10:27.083 --> 10:29.541
It is magic, but it is not free.

10:29.625 --> 10:32.875
It will drain your energy, your life.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.583
Hmph.

10:35.666 --> 10:37.500
I will happily take the risk.

10:37.583 --> 10:41.625
And it will awaken the Eldwyrms
and their children.

10:42.291 --> 10:46.833
They will rage, they will eat,
and then they will come here.

10:46.916 --> 10:50.541
Leaving us with only one
unthinkable recourse.

10:50.625 --> 10:53.875
You will trade horror for horror.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.500
I refuse to accept that.

10:56.583 --> 10:59.083
And that is your nature.

11:03.416 --> 11:08.125
If you have any more harmless secrets,
I suggest you share them.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.791
I need to tell him, don't I?

11:18.041 --> 11:19.666
I just wish I knew how.

11:30.083 --> 11:31.416
The new moon.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.375
I'd almost forgotten.

11:33.458 --> 11:37.041
A time for mourning
and remembrance of the dead.

11:37.125 --> 11:38.750
A religious practice which…

11:39.375 --> 11:42.541
forgive me, Goddess,
I have never observed.

11:42.625 --> 11:43.750
Perhaps you should.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.375
The Dragon Knight, your Dragon Knight.
I'd almost forgotten him as well.

11:50.458 --> 11:52.833
You forget nothing, ever.

11:52.916 --> 11:55.083
It's just that he's no longer
relevant to you.

11:56.083 --> 11:57.791
He is quite relevant to me.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.291
I never got to say goodbye.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.166
Have you done as I asked?

12:04.250 --> 12:05.833
Have you confessed to Filomena?

12:05.916 --> 12:08.333
-There was no need.
-She knew?

12:09.041 --> 12:10.708
Clever, like her father.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.750
A gifted mind,
but her heart will get the best of her.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.458
Also like her father.

12:16.541 --> 12:20.208
I know my daughter.
Filomena is headstrong and relentless.

12:20.291 --> 12:22.625
She will use every resource
at her command,

12:22.708 --> 12:26.041
but she will fail as I failed.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.833
She has become a danger to herself.

12:28.875 --> 12:30.375
So, this is why you've come.

12:30.458 --> 12:34.833
-Filomena listens to you.
-Because I listen to Filomena.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.958
If you want to save her,
stop fighting her.

12:39.041 --> 12:41.750
Help her. Be her father.

12:55.833 --> 12:58.000
Sorry, Marci. I didn't mean to wake you.

12:58.958 --> 13:02.625
Oh, Davion is right. I hate his solution.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.458
Help from the Invoker.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.208
Am I a hypocrite?

13:08.291 --> 13:11.833
All of my high-minded talk
about old hatreds,

13:11.916 --> 13:14.833
and here I sit,
nursing the oldest of them all.

13:15.791 --> 13:17.708
The Devil of the Moon.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.791
He must know what's happening.

13:20.875 --> 13:23.791
The fact he has yet to resolve it
suggests he lacks the means,

13:23.875 --> 13:26.000
but he may have an idea what can be done.

13:26.083 --> 13:30.458
On the other hand,
all of this is his design, this reality…

13:31.416 --> 13:33.708
it may be this is exactly what he wants.

13:33.791 --> 13:37.916
It may be that this nightmare
is also his design.

13:38.875 --> 13:41.666
But none of that matters, does it?

13:41.750 --> 13:43.375
His design or not,

13:43.458 --> 13:46.750
we have to understand
what we're up against.

14:01.333 --> 14:05.000
You're right. You're always right.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.000
There's that look.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.125
-Which look?
-The one you get.

14:15.208 --> 14:17.833
You bow your head, knit your brow.

14:17.916 --> 14:20.666
It means you're scared as hell,
but doing something anyway.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.000
The other me saw it a lot.

14:23.083 --> 14:26.208
In times past, this would have been
a moment for prayer,

14:26.291 --> 14:31.875
but today, the universe has arranged
things such that I have no one to pray to.

14:32.666 --> 14:34.541
I remember his whole life.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.541
I remember how he died.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.208
The last thing he saw was you.

14:40.166 --> 14:41.041
Your face.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.166
It was enough.

14:44.125 --> 14:46.958
You were enough. He didn't need to pray.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.041
Prepare yourselves.

14:57.791 --> 14:59.125
Oh, shit. Are we gonna…

15:02.500 --> 15:03.500
…do that?

15:13.250 --> 15:16.583
You have entered my home
without invitation.

15:23.708 --> 15:26.500
We have business
with the master of this place.

15:37.833 --> 15:38.916
You.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.416
You're her, I know you.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.916
She's the mystery girl.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.916
The Ember Eldwyrm.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.583
My father said the dragons may react,

15:49.666 --> 15:53.333
but this isn't quite
the reaction he imagined.

15:53.416 --> 15:54.333
Your father?

15:54.416 --> 15:56.625
If you've come to see him,
you've come in vain.

15:56.708 --> 15:58.083
He will not help you.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.041
But perhaps we can help each other.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.375
A failed notion recurs.

16:14.250 --> 16:19.625
The self alone can maintain unity
and hold this prison.

16:19.708 --> 16:23.666
I have not come to fight you
or pacify the Ancients.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.083
I have come to draw the curtain.

16:26.166 --> 16:30.416
The self will allow no further disruption
of the unity.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.125
You will cease!

16:37.333 --> 16:39.333
The prison will be maintained.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.250
The fragments bound.

16:41.333 --> 16:46.500
You will be destroyed.
Your power is irrelevant.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.041
I carry power greater than my own.

16:53.125 --> 16:58.333
I free you of your burden
and unshackle your masters.

16:58.416 --> 17:00.250
No!

17:01.750 --> 17:04.791
Discorporation cannot be possible.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.541
The self must not be lost.

17:08.416 --> 17:12.791
All that remains is the rage
of the Primordial Mind.

17:17.416 --> 17:19.250
Let the end begin.

17:31.416 --> 17:35.166
My father used the Pillars of Creation
to remake the universe.

17:35.250 --> 17:37.541
I believe we can set them
to a more subtle purpose.

17:38.375 --> 17:42.000
Restoring the structural integrity
of the broken moon.

17:42.083 --> 17:43.250
That machine.

17:45.583 --> 17:48.166
I know it. I saw it in Foulfell.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.333
The Forge? You saw it?

17:50.416 --> 17:52.708
I was there. I remember it all.

17:53.958 --> 17:54.916
Curious.

17:58.750 --> 18:02.666
The one you saw would have required us
to possess the dragon souls.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.083
This one accesses them directly.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.583
And by access, you mean…

18:07.666 --> 18:09.166
Kill, yes.

18:09.250 --> 18:13.125
It doesn't have to.
I think we can simply draw power.

18:13.208 --> 18:16.750
Use them without destroying them.
Just enough to get the job done.

18:16.833 --> 18:18.166
<i>It no longer matters.</i>

18:18.916 --> 18:22.541
The arc warden is gone,
and the entities will not be contained.

18:22.625 --> 18:26.166
The destruction of the moon
is a foregone conclusion.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.541
Soon, there will be nothing left
to repair.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.541
I cannot change your nature,

18:30.625 --> 18:33.041
but I can manage the problem.

18:33.666 --> 18:35.708
Father, what have you done?

18:35.791 --> 18:38.750
Whatever it was, he will undo it.

18:38.833 --> 18:43.125
Even Selemene knew better
than to attack me in my own home.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.166
No. We're not doing this.

18:49.583 --> 18:50.791
This is my home.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.291
I don't need anyone's protection.

18:54.125 --> 18:57.250
And I am done bargaining with you.

18:57.333 --> 18:58.875
So be it.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.166
Mirana!

19:10.000 --> 19:11.500
<i>You are a young god.</i>

19:11.583 --> 19:16.083
<i>Days old, your eyes barely open.
You hardly learn to crawl.</i>

19:17.041 --> 19:19.333
<i>You are nothing.</i>

19:20.041 --> 19:25.333
Here, far from any sun to grant you power,
you are even less than that.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.791
I can't dismiss them.

19:32.583 --> 19:35.750
-What in all the hells are they?
-He wants me to protect you.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.416
They're a distraction.
It means we have time.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.083
Do whatever you need to do.

19:41.166 --> 19:42.666
Get ready, we fight.

19:53.000 --> 19:53.875
What…

19:54.625 --> 19:56.708
-What can I do?
-Watch the skies.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.708
Oh, Princess.

20:30.791 --> 20:35.166
In all the many universes I have known,
you are unique.

20:35.250 --> 20:38.666
Cursed as I am,
with the ache of things lost

20:38.750 --> 20:41.666
that cannot be said
to have existed at all.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.791
If it's any comfort,
I was never your enemy.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.500
-<i>I never meant you harm.</i>

20:46.583 --> 20:50.291
<i>I think you know what it's like
to love someone so much…</i>

20:51.333 --> 20:54.083
there is no sacrifice you wouldn't make.

20:54.166 --> 20:57.458
No sin you will not commit
to keep them safe.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.125
I think you know.

21:00.208 --> 21:03.541
Because you pursued me
across the boundaries of reality

21:03.625 --> 21:06.166
to restore what you lost.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.625
You will lose it all…

21:08.625 --> 21:10.416
one final time.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.000
Oh, no.

21:59.833 --> 22:01.000
We're too late.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.750
What in the hells are you doing?

22:34.625 --> 22:36.166
The one thing I know I'm good at.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.791
You think I'm a monster. I know.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.916
But you would have done the same.

24:48.500 --> 24:51.375
Anyone would have done the same.
