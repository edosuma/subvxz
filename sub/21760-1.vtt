This is very good.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.960
My-- my best work yet.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.040
Oh, I've outdone myself.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.460
No, no, no, no, no, Lucky.

01:36.460 --> 01:37.920
I know you're curious,

01:37.920 --> 01:41.000
but this is top secret.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.710
-No one can ever see this.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.080
Especially not her.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.380
Lucky, don't let anything
happen to this disk.

02:05.380 --> 02:07.330
Guard it with your life!

02:09.120 --> 02:10.830
Okay.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.620
Bah! Whose idiotic idea was it

02:16.620 --> 02:19.830
to put a birdbath
in the middle of your driveway?

02:20.960 --> 02:24.580
Cruella, we don't have
a birdbath in our driveway.

02:24.580 --> 02:25.750
Well, you do now.

02:26.790 --> 02:28.120
Cheap.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.210
Hmm. Dusty.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.210
Annoying.

02:36.210 --> 02:38.250
Enough chitchat.

02:38.250 --> 02:42.460
I'm here to see
how our little video game
business is coming along.

02:42.460 --> 02:45.540
Do you know how much money
I've invested in it?

02:45.540 --> 02:48.120
-Anita: Uhh...
-More than you deserve,
to be exact!

02:48.120 --> 02:52.330
-And I demand...
-Roger: The best, and you
will get it, I assure you.

02:52.330 --> 02:55.210
My new computer game
will blow the competition away

02:55.210 --> 02:57.920
and make millions
to boot. You'll see!

02:57.920 --> 02:59.120
But I see nothing.

03:00.120 --> 03:01.120
Nothing!

03:02.120 --> 03:04.790
I want results now!

03:07.000 --> 03:08.040
Hmm.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.880
-Memo to myself:

03:10.880 --> 03:13.750
Put more windows
in Rupert's house.

03:13.750 --> 03:14.750
-Arr!

03:16.750 --> 03:18.880
Gone.

03:39.790 --> 03:42.080
Small, small, small.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.580
Cool!

03:43.580 --> 03:45.710
This is great!

03:45.710 --> 03:48.420
Rolly! Cadpig!
You guys!

03:50.380 --> 03:52.250
Rolly! Cadpig!

03:54.750 --> 03:55.920
Scorch!

04:05.120 --> 04:07.620
Cough it up, hairball.

04:35.830 --> 04:38.380
Who put the birdbath
in the driveway?

04:38.380 --> 04:41.210
Ah! I love birdbaths.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.750
I love birds.
They make me happy.

04:45.710 --> 04:47.710
Watch it, birdbrain!

04:47.710 --> 04:51.120
Scorch stole a disk
and we gotta get it back

04:51.120 --> 04:55.670
or I--
uh, I mean, Roger will be
in a lot of trouble.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.620
Wow. Sounds like
a lot of work.

04:58.620 --> 05:01.000
Good luck
with that, buddy.
See you later.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.500
Come on,
we can still catch him

05:03.500 --> 05:05.460
before he gets
to Cruella's!

05:06.880 --> 05:10.210
Oh, goody!
We get to ferret out
the ferret.

05:20.790 --> 05:23.040
This way!
I know a shortcut!

05:42.540 --> 05:44.710
I hate shortcuts.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.750
Lucky:
Rolly!

05:50.750 --> 05:53.960
So, what took you guys
so long, eh?

05:53.960 --> 05:56.210
We were too busy...

05:56.210 --> 05:59.540
not getting... stuck.

06:01.210 --> 06:04.120
Whoa!

06:06.710 --> 06:08.040
Ouch!

06:09.620 --> 06:12.330
-Look!

06:15.830 --> 06:18.580
We'd better
get that disk before Scorch
gives it to Cruella

06:18.580 --> 06:22.620
or Lucky-- er, I mean Roger
will be in a lot of trouble.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.710
-Let's go.
-Aww, gee.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.460
You know I'd love to, really,

06:26.460 --> 06:29.080
but I think we've done
enough for today,

06:29.080 --> 06:31.330
actually, and I-- I--

06:31.330 --> 06:34.290
We don't have time to think.
We've gotta act now.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.620
Let's do it for Roger.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.580
Let's do it for Roger!

06:38.580 --> 06:42.250
Let's do it before dinner!

06:56.040 --> 07:02.750
Rolly:
Eww. This is scary.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.040
I know. No TV.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.580
Look! There's Scorch!

07:10.580 --> 07:13.170
Lucky:
We can't let Cruella
get that disk!

07:14.710 --> 07:16.710
Ehh!

07:21.670 --> 07:23.330
Freeze, ferret.

07:35.710 --> 07:38.580
Lucky

07:56.040 --> 07:57.330
Gotcha!

07:58.330 --> 08:00.000
Um, Lucky?

08:00.000 --> 08:03.540
Next time, why don't
you tackle the bad guy?

08:04.670 --> 08:06.750
Sorry, Rolly.

08:34.170 --> 08:35.330
Thank you.

08:35.330 --> 08:36.580
Ha! Got it!

08:36.580 --> 08:38.710
-Buh-bye.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.380
-Hey! That's my disk.
-Uh-oh.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.080
-He's toast.
-That's where
we come in, Rolly.

08:51.080 --> 08:54.500
We've got to conquer
all our counterproductive,
gut-ripping fears

08:54.500 --> 08:56.540
and do what any
best friends would do:

08:56.540 --> 08:59.670
go in there
and face Cruella with him.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.830
Or we could just leave.

09:01.830 --> 09:03.500
Sure, we could do that.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.460
Hmm. What is
the big secret over there?

09:13.170 --> 09:15.540
Oh, not now, Scorch.

09:15.540 --> 09:22.290
I'm trying to find out what
that sneaky Roger Dearly was
trying to hide from me today.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.250
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

09:24.250 --> 09:27.170
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

09:35.460 --> 09:37.960
Oh! These are useless!

09:42.830 --> 09:44.250
Thank you.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.500
Oh! Worthless junk!

09:49.790 --> 09:51.830
Whoa!

09:56.460 --> 09:59.290
Thank you.

10:01.540 --> 10:06.750
Come on, Randy.
Let's see what you've got.

10:15.830 --> 10:17.170
Oh!

10:33.330 --> 10:36.210
Computer:
The Cruellanator.

10:36.210 --> 10:39.040
The Crue

10:42.790 --> 10:44.880
Oh, no. Where is it?

10:44.880 --> 10:46.500
I knew I left it here.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.170
I mean,
it was right here!

10:48.170 --> 10:52.250
Lucky, I asked you to guard
that disk with your life!

10:52.250 --> 10:53.830
How could you lose it?

10:53.830 --> 10:56.790
Uh-oh, I don't think
we kept Lucky--

10:56.790 --> 11:00.040
uh, I mean,
Roger out of trouble.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.620
Do you know what could happen
if Cruella sees that game?

11:03.620 --> 11:07.170
She'll screech right over here
in that hideous car...

11:08.880 --> 11:10.330
march up those stairs...

11:12.830 --> 11:16.250
-and shout...
-Cruella: Roger Dearly!

11:18.120 --> 11:19.460
I love it.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.790
But I've made
a few changes.

11:23.790 --> 11:25.790
Here, take a look.

11:44.620 --> 11:48.120
Half gainer
reverse pike jackknife.

11:52.790 --> 11:56.830
Triple forward flip
with an upside-down frown!

11:58.250 --> 11:59.670
Whee!

12:00.830 --> 12:03.380
Belly flop!

12:10.710 --> 12:13.620
Rolly, next time
you go first.

12:16.250 --> 12:21.750
Uh-oh. The two-minutes-to-lunch
warning growl.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.330
That means lunch
is in two minutes.

12:27.330 --> 12:30.000
We're never gonna make it!

12:30.000 --> 12:31.750
Never say "Never"!

12:31.750 --> 12:33.750
We can do it!

12:41.380 --> 12:42.750
Ah!

12:44.830 --> 12:47.040
Rolly!

12:47.040 --> 12:49.250
Don't miss lunch
because of me!

12:49.250 --> 12:51.580
Save yourselves!

12:52.920 --> 12:54.500
Thanks, Rolly!

12:55.620 --> 12:58.120
We can't just leave
and let him starve.

12:58.120 --> 13:01.080
We can do anything
if we try.

13:02.420 --> 13:03.750
Come on!

13:26.620 --> 13:29.080
Okay, no more stalling.
Let's go!

13:31.120 --> 13:35.960
Whoa! Whoa! Whoo! Whoo!

13:37.670 --> 13:38.750
Look!

13:39.960 --> 13:42.710
A tractor!
Hey, come on, everybody.

13:42.710 --> 13:46.080
Jump aboard or eat my dust!

13:51.080 --> 13:53.620
Uh... never mind.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.540
30 seconds to lunch.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.170
Double time!

14:24.920 --> 14:26.710
Yoo-hoo-ooh!

14:26.710 --> 14:29.210
Come and get it!

14:38.120 --> 14:39.420
Yippee!

14:45.120 --> 14:48.420
That growl can
only mean one thing:

14:48.420 --> 14:54.120
We... missed... lunch!

14:55.460 --> 14:57.210
What--
what did he say, Tibbs?

14:57.210 --> 15:00.880
-Lunch, sir.
-Oh yes, lunch.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.880
It was a meal to remember.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.960
The kibble-- huh!
--made its own gravy.

15:06.960 --> 15:11.080
Why, Nanny mixed in
juicy scraps of tender sirloin.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.290
And a rather generous cut
of filet mignon.

15:16.330 --> 15:19.670
Oh, reminds me
of a meal I once had

15:19.670 --> 15:21.380
in Bologna, Italy.

15:27.080 --> 15:29.290
You know,
when I get hungry,

15:29.290 --> 15:32.170
I have a mental meal.

15:32.170 --> 15:35.120
Mmm!

15:36.790 --> 15:39.960
Right now, I'm having
a heaping stack

15:39.960 --> 15:41.420
of blueberry pancakes

15:41.420 --> 15:42.920
with honey butter,

15:42.920 --> 15:44.420
and warm maple syrup,

15:44.420 --> 15:46.250
and a side of sausage links,

15:46.250 --> 15:48.000
and home fries, orange juice,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.170
and wheat toast--

15:49.170 --> 15:51.250
buttered
on one side only, please.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.750
Thank you!

15:58.250 --> 16:02.170
Hmm. Looks like he's having
a psychic sugar rush.

16:02.170 --> 16:05.170
Oh, there you are.

16:05.170 --> 16:06.170
I was worried sick

16:06.170 --> 16:07.960
when you guys
missed lunch today.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.830
I mean,
today of all the days,

16:09.830 --> 16:12.920
with the gravy
on the sirloin. Ah!

16:12.920 --> 16:16.120
Did you hear?
The Colonel got filet!

16:19.620 --> 16:22.210
But you don't have
to worry. Listen.

16:22.210 --> 16:24.040
We don't have time to listen.

16:25.210 --> 16:27.120
We may have missed
lunch hour,

16:27.120 --> 16:29.170
but lunch will be ours!

16:29.170 --> 16:32.580
I've got a plan
that will have us
chowing down in no time.

16:32.580 --> 16:35.210
We'll be swimming
in kibble once we--

16:35.210 --> 16:38.120
Lucky, if I could
just interject here
for a second.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.880
Spot, don't interrupt my moment.

16:39.880 --> 16:43.830
Once we break
into the chow tower!

16:46.330 --> 16:48.540
Great moment, Lucky.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.960
Let's get a "moove" on!

16:57.040 --> 16:58.420
I'm telling you, Duchess,

16:58.420 --> 17:01.080
those dalmatians are
hazardous to your health.

17:01.080 --> 17:05.040
Don't worry, Duchess.
This it totally safe.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.000
Safer than safety-scissors safe.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.380
Ahem. Lucky,
about the food--

17:10.380 --> 17:12.920
Spot, you're gonna
have to stay back.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.000
This is totally dangerous.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.250
-Very, very dangerous!

17:18.880 --> 17:21.580
Lucky:
Places, everyone!
On three!

17:21.580 --> 17:25.040
One, two, three!

17:25.040 --> 17:27.120
Whee!

17:31.960 --> 17:35.920
Ground Control,
we have a problem.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.420
Uh, excuse me,
but Nanny left--

17:44.420 --> 17:46.000
Ah, she'll come back.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.040
Come on, Spot, push!

17:52.790 --> 17:54.500
Trio:
Incoming!

18:01.330 --> 18:05.040
I must have "sucker" branded
on my derriere.

18:05.040 --> 18:09.040
On your mark,
get set... go!

18:09.040 --> 18:11.580
Whoa! Oof!

18:16.170 --> 18:19.040
Daddy!

18:19.040 --> 18:20.920
If'n I ever get up,

18:20.920 --> 18:24.250
you puppies are
in a world of trouble.

18:31.830 --> 18:34.380
Look at the bright side, Rolly.

18:34.380 --> 18:38.330
If this takes much longer,
it'll be dinner time.

18:38.330 --> 18:43.000
But I need food now!

18:43.000 --> 18:46.040
Relax, you guys.
Just look back--

18:46.040 --> 18:49.710
Only quitters look back!
We've gotta look forward.

18:49.710 --> 18:50.830
Am I right?

18:50.830 --> 18:51.880
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

19:00.620 --> 19:03.620
-Cadpig: Whoa!
-Lucky: Whoo-hoo!

19:03.620 --> 19:05.620
Whoa! Ugh!

19:07.920 --> 19:10.670
You gonna make me get up.

19:37.330 --> 19:40.710
I'm getting up!

19:40.710 --> 19:43.920
Please! I am trying
to tell you--

19:43.920 --> 19:47.330
We've tried everything
to get in there.

19:47.330 --> 19:49.750
If only we had a-- a...

19:49.750 --> 19:52.040
A giant helium balloon...

19:52.040 --> 19:54.120
Shaped like a peanut.

20:03.830 --> 20:05.710
Puppies: Whoa!

20:20.120 --> 20:22.580
Whoa! That looks like fun!

20:22.580 --> 20:25.540
Have you been drinking
your own milk again?

20:28.880 --> 20:32.790
Cadpig: Well, at least
we didn't all end up
in the mudhole again.

20:39.790 --> 20:41.380
I'm up.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.830
Well, there's the mud bath.

20:46.830 --> 20:49.500
When's the herbal rub?

20:49.500 --> 20:53.250
There's gotta be a way in,
something we haven't
thought of yet.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.830
Come on, everyone, think!

21:01.000 --> 21:04.670
Listen, you guys,
you're just digging yourselves
deeper into a hole.

21:04.670 --> 21:08.170
-You've got to--
-That's it!

21:08.170 --> 21:11.250
It's a poultry epiphany!

21:11.250 --> 21:13.750
We'll dig our way in!

21:17.670 --> 21:21.080
Stop! Wait! I have
to tell you two things!

21:21.080 --> 21:25.040
Number one, Nanny left
extra kibble for you back
at the farmhouse!

21:26.830 --> 21:28.710
Puppies:
What's number two?

21:28.710 --> 21:30.290
Look out for the...

21:31.420 --> 21:32.750
sewer pipe.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.580
-Mmm, mmm, mmm.

21:36.580 --> 21:38.460
You know what
I've learned, Spot?

21:38.460 --> 21:41.620
-Mm-hmm.
You learned...
-To listen.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.620
I mean,
think how much easier
it would've been

21:44.620 --> 21:46.750
if we'd listened
to you from the start.

21:46.750 --> 21:48.750
Well, for one thing--

21:48.750 --> 21:51.790
Oh, Spot,
when you have
something to say,

21:51.790 --> 21:55.750
please don't let us
ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever interrupt. 'Kay?

21:55.750 --> 21:57.920
Well, actually,

21:57.920 --> 22:00.000
I do have
something to say. It--

22:00.000 --> 22:04.960
Spot, please!
Can't you see we're
trying to eat here?
