ANNOUNCER (on TV):
We now return to <i>Gay's Anatomy.</i>

00:36.003 --> 00:37.101
MAN:
There's his anus.

00:37.103 --> 00:40.939
Well, way too many channels
to just watch one.

00:40.941 --> 00:45.444
And now for my next trick,
I will cut a woman in half.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.113
You're just turning one problem
into two.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.951
What?!
I thought he was kidding.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.753
You can't... He's gonna kill
that woman!

00:54.755 --> 00:56.021
Help!

00:56.023 --> 00:57.589
Don't worry, Rallo, we're here.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.291
That guy on TV's
cutting...

00:59.293 --> 01:00.959
Why are you dressed
like that?

01:00.961 --> 01:03.162
We were playing <i>Raising Arizona.</i>

01:03.164 --> 01:04.596
Oh, I didn't see
that one.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.365
You've never seen
<i>Raising Arizona?!</i>

01:06.367 --> 01:08.033
You've gotta see it.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.368
I don't need to do anything.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.136
But that dude just cut
a woman in half.

01:11.138 --> 01:14.106
Oh, Rallo,
your innocence is endearing.

01:14.108 --> 01:15.374
That's just magic.

01:15.376 --> 01:16.842
What's that?

01:16.844 --> 01:19.144
Magic is the explanation
for the unexplainable.

01:19.146 --> 01:21.346
Like making a quarter vanish.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.182
Or pulling a rabbit
out of a hat.

01:23.184 --> 01:27.519
Or how Jack Black can utterly
disappear into every role.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.088
Magic.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.592
(chuckles) Me and Lester are
texting each other, Donna.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.962
Can you imagine him lying
in bed next to Kendra?

01:36.964 --> 01:39.932
They'd look like the
number ten. (chuckles)

01:39.934 --> 01:41.767
Oh... Mmm.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.469
I feel bad for Lester.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.604
Hey, guys, I got a
magic trick for you.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.206
Hey, hey, hey,
get out of here, Rallo.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.374
How do you know we weren't doing
something private?

01:49.376 --> 01:50.943
'Cause I don't hear
"Celebration"

01:50.945 --> 01:51.943
by Kool & the Gang.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.513
Now, think of a number
and then write it down,

01:54.515 --> 01:56.748
and only use this pen
and press really hard,

01:56.750 --> 01:59.685
and then rip it off
and don't let me see it.

02:02.021 --> 02:03.589
(scribbling)

02:03.591 --> 02:05.824
Okay. Was your number ten?

02:05.826 --> 02:07.526
Yeah. Poor Lester.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.761
Cute trick, Rallo.
Run along to bed.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.929
Hold on now.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.765
You haven't seen the incredible
floating cigarette.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.667
Rallo, where'd you get
that cigarette?

02:15.669 --> 02:18.437
Tobacco company rep was handing
'em out at the playground.

02:18.439 --> 02:20.305
Smart.
Now go back to bed.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.841
One more, one more.
Pick a card, any card.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.977
Jack of clubs.
Go away.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.178
Aw, man.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.379
(door closes)

02:27.381 --> 02:29.481
Why are you so hard
on that boy?

02:29.483 --> 02:30.949
Step-boy.

02:30.951 --> 02:33.185
You could've at least
let him have his moment.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.988
You could let
me have mine.

02:35.990 --> 02:39.324
(hums "Celebration")

02:39.326 --> 02:41.460
Uh-uh!

02:41.462 --> 02:43.495
Sorry, Kool. Sorry, Gang.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.630
Hopefully tomorrow night.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.631
(all groan)

02:45.633 --> 02:46.999
Damn!
Ain't that a bitch?

02:47.001 --> 02:49.434
Man, I was ready to play!

02:52.005 --> 02:53.805
AP calculus is wack

02:53.807 --> 02:55.974
wit dey derivative-ass
functions.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.777
You want to grow up to build
suspension bridges or not?

02:58.779 --> 03:00.479
Hey, Roberta,
there's a magic club

03:00.481 --> 03:02.447
over in Chester County,
and Mama can't drive me,

03:02.449 --> 03:05.117
so your dirtbag boyfriend's
gotta take me.

03:05.119 --> 03:06.251
Sorry. We're going to visit

03:06.253 --> 03:08.153
Federline's grandmother
in the hospital.

03:08.155 --> 03:11.089
Don't worry--
you won't see it.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.992
Cleveland!
You're my only hope.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.795
I need you to take me to
the magic club in Chester.

03:16.797 --> 03:21.500
Sorry, but I have my, uh,
fantasy women's billiards draft.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.001
Liar. That was last week.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.704
You got Ewa Mataya Laurance
in the first round.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.940
Hmm, The Striking Viking.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.041
Please?!
I'll do anything.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.442
Rallo, I really can't.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.144
You can just wait
in the car.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.345
I'm not doing it.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.379
Please!
No.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.514
Please!
No!

03:35.516 --> 03:37.082
Please, Dad.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.986
It's working.
The blended family is working.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.854
Rallo called me "Dad."

03:42.856 --> 03:44.156
Oh, Cleveland,
that's wonderful.

03:44.158 --> 03:46.491
I'm gonna mold that boy
into my own image.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.527
He'll be like a little me.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.128
A Cleveland Jr.,
if you will.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.598
You already have
a Cleveland Jr.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.132
Donna, I don't have time
for you to be right.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.434
I got to get dressed.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.036
I'm taking my boy
to the magic show.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.338
(voice breaking):
I just hope they have

03:59.340 --> 04:02.341
the pull-the-hanky-
from-the-sleeve act,

04:02.343 --> 04:05.777
'cause I'm gonna need
all 200 of 'em.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.779
(whimpers)

04:07.781 --> 04:09.581
You're gonna be fine.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.583
Lord knows you can't do
any worse than the last time

04:11.585 --> 04:13.986
Robert took Rallo
for the weekend.

04:13.988 --> 04:16.822
(cheering and whooping)

04:16.824 --> 04:18.490
(yelling)

04:18.492 --> 04:20.926
Put me down, you human garbage!

04:23.029 --> 04:25.097
(whimsical music plays)

04:34.340 --> 04:35.974
(à la Willy Wonka):
Hold your breath.

04:35.976 --> 04:39.044
Make a wish.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.779
Count to three.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.748
Now hold your breath again

04:42.750 --> 04:46.251
because I'm farting
and farting.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.423
Wow.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.058
See?

04:54.927 --> 04:56.828
Can you tell my fortune?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.030
Colon cancer.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.398
Dang.

05:03.002 --> 05:04.703
Wow.
Can I keep him?

05:04.705 --> 05:05.837
Of course you can.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.373
Anything you find in
your hat is yours.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.610
Ever since
<i>Stetson v. Oklahoma.</i>

05:11.612 --> 05:14.112
Cool, a Ferrari. Mine.

05:14.114 --> 05:16.648
(laughs, engine revs,
tires squeal)

05:16.650 --> 05:19.351
(screams, crashing sounds)

05:19.353 --> 05:21.920
Not my car.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.656
(siren wailing)

05:27.093 --> 05:28.994
(audience cheering)

05:31.331 --> 05:33.198
EMCEE:
And now ladies and gentlemen,

05:33.200 --> 05:37.002
our main attraction,
Magical Johnson!

05:37.004 --> 05:38.170
(audience cheering)

05:39.972 --> 05:42.007
(whispers):
That's my boy sitting on my lap.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.041
(whispers):
Good.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.110
Technically, my stepson,

05:45.112 --> 05:47.612
but he called me "Dad" today
for the first time.

05:47.614 --> 05:49.181
Congratulations.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.749
(sniffs deeply)

05:50.751 --> 05:53.919
His hair smells wonderful.
Take a whiff.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.253
I'm trying
to watch the show!

05:55.255 --> 05:57.255
Smell it!

05:57.257 --> 05:58.990
You're right.
It   <i>i</i>nice.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.158
Can I smell yours?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.127
You could, but I have to use

06:02.129 --> 06:06.031
special shampoo on account
of my "p-soriasis."

06:06.033 --> 06:07.165
(audience exclaims)

06:07.167 --> 06:08.600
Can we stay after the show

06:08.602 --> 06:11.002
to get Magical Johnson
to sign my program?

06:11.004 --> 06:14.206
We can stay here forever
as far as I'm concerned.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.108
Forever.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.476
(inhales deeply)

06:17.478 --> 06:18.844
Mmm...

06:19.812 --> 06:22.080
Oh, look at him--
all tuckered out

06:22.082 --> 06:25.484
from a magical day
with his wonderful dad.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.985
(groggily):
I'm not sleepy.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.187
I'm just gonna rest
my eyes...

06:29.189 --> 06:32.357

06:36.029 --> 06:40.098

Hey, it's you!

06:50.611 --> 06:52.177
Magical Johnson is real!

06:52.179 --> 06:55.147
Rallo, wake up!

06:55.149 --> 06:57.949
What are you doing here?
The auditions are tomorrow.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.117
Auditions?

06:59.119 --> 07:01.153
Say, that's
a good-looking dummy.

07:01.155 --> 07:02.921
Who you calling a dummy,
dummy?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.022
That's not polite.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.791
Neither is beating
Daryl Hannah,

07:05.793 --> 07:07.926
but that didn't stop
Jackson Browne.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.694
(chuckles)
Okay, okay,
I've seen enough.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.596
You open
the show Sunday.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.798
Open the show?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.499
That's how we do it
with new acts.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.134
You do well, you move up.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.102
And you probably will.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.438
People love ventriloquists.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.606
I think there's
been a mistake...

07:21.608 --> 07:22.841
Is it a paying gig?

07:22.843 --> 07:25.710
You are paid quite handsomely
in ear coins.

07:25.712 --> 07:28.180
BOTH:
We'll make a waxy fortune!

07:28.182 --> 07:29.648
See you Sunday!

07:29.650 --> 07:31.316
Whoa.
You guys are good.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.752
But so am I.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.922
That's not what
I meant to do.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.890
Ta-tas!

07:44.130 --> 07:46.164
But, Donna, we're not
doing anything wrong.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.033
You'd be lying
to the audience.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.502
And teaching my son
to lie is not okay.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.971
You told him his
father was a war hero

07:52.973 --> 07:54.206
and then Santa Claus.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.174
It's okay to lie
to children.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.809
When I was raising Rallo
by myself,

07:57.811 --> 07:59.377
if I didn't make up
the bogeyman,

07:59.379 --> 08:00.645
I would've been so bored.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.681
But all magic is based on lying.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.116
David Copperfield doesn't
actually levitate

08:05.118 --> 08:06.918
or turn canes into doves.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.754
Although he did make
the Statue of Liberty disappear.

08:09.756 --> 08:12.123
That was real.
The one there now is fake.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.593
It's two inches shorter
and way hotter.

08:14.595 --> 08:19.498
You can read about it on
my blog: HTTP, equal sign,

08:19.500 --> 08:21.967
but with dots instead of dashes,

08:21.969 --> 08:24.870
leaning to the right line,
leaning to the right line,

08:24.872 --> 08:26.938
three W's, period,

08:26.940 --> 08:30.609
Statue of Duplicity--
all one word-- period,

08:30.611 --> 08:34.446
blogspot, period, C-O-M.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.615
I said no,
and that's final.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.916
Aw, dingleberries.

08:37.918 --> 08:41.286
Listen, Donna, I rarely
ask you for anything.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.921
You ask me
for things every day.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.155
Just this morning you asked

08:44.157 --> 08:46.525
if I would put on your uniform
and work your shift.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.659
And you didn't,

08:47.661 --> 08:49.995
so would you just do
this one thing for me?

08:49.997 --> 08:51.596
This is exactly the kind

08:51.598 --> 08:53.965
of father-son bonding
experience we need.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.134
We tried camping
in the backyard,

08:56.136 --> 08:57.969
but there was a scary cat.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.939
Okay, fine.
For you and Rallo.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.541
You can do your act.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.109
You won't regret this.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.176
I'm sure I will.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.811
Well, too bad.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.780
You agreed and I got
it all on tape.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.649
(muffled voice, heartbeat):
Okay, fine.

09:10.651 --> 09:11.917
(heartbeat slows)
For you and Rallo.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.919

You can do your act.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.987
Cleveland,

09:15.989 --> 09:18.023
Yeah, there's a
thumbtack in there.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.124
Mmm.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.860
You know, Dad, you two
are gonna need a manager.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.094
We should talk.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.696
You? A manager?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.498
What are
your qualifications?

09:26.500 --> 09:28.033
I can be very persuasive.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.501
Can't argue with that.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.269
You got it.

How's my two favorite

I love it.

You're up next.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.630
And if you see anyone
in the audience

09:58.632 --> 10:00.966
you want to "meet" after,
let me know.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.086
So, Bean, did you hear
what happened to the bee

10:21.088 --> 10:23.622
who went to the doctor
for sticky hair?

10:23.624 --> 10:25.323
No, Porque,
what happened?

10:25.325 --> 10:29.260
He told him
to stop using his honeycomb.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.863
(woman coughs)

10:33.132 --> 10:35.934
(clears throat)

10:35.936 --> 10:37.302
Word on the street is

10:37.304 --> 10:40.639
that Bazooka Joe's grandma
sewed him three socks.

10:40.641 --> 10:41.940
Why would she do that?

10:41.942 --> 10:46.411
Because she heard that over
the summer he grew another foot.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.946
MAN:
That's from gum.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.982
Ah, put me out
of my misery.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.585
Anyone want to toss a
brother in a wood chipper?

10:53.587 --> 10:54.819

Stick to the act.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.722
Stick to your diet,
you fat tub of crap.

10:59.191 --> 11:01.526
Now, <i>that's</i> clever.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.695
(audience laughing)

11:03.697 --> 11:07.332
Well, Bean, you got any other
problems with our act?

11:07.334 --> 11:10.535
Let's see, you got me dressed
up like black Chucky,

11:10.537 --> 11:12.137
you're doing
jokes so bad,

11:12.139 --> 11:14.539
even Carlos Mencia
wouldn't steal them,

11:14.541 --> 11:16.141
and according
to your breath,

11:16.143 --> 11:19.144
you just ate a tuna sandwich
with extra fart sauce.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.311
(laughter)

11:20.313 --> 11:21.746
They're so funny.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.748
You can't even see
his lips move.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.750
He's making
my lips move.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.019
(whispers):
This will get you backstage.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.154
Well, that's our time.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.156
Anything you want
to say before we go?

11:31.158 --> 11:32.157
Yeah. Help!

11:32.159 --> 11:33.825
AMBER Alert!

12:51.972 --> 12:54.172
We tore this place
a new funny bone.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.108
I'm telling you, we killed,
like Michael Vick did

Please, Rallo,

Oscar the Grouch.

Caroll Spinney.

(knocking)

13:17.631 --> 13:18.763
One minute.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.198
(whispers):
Dummy mode.

13:23.702 --> 13:27.038
I'd like to introduce you
to Mr. Graham Kensington,

13:27.040 --> 13:30.809
the    <i>Chester Herald's</i>
<i>esteemed ventriloquist critic.</i>

13:30.811 --> 13:33.011
I've seen many a
man and his dummy

13:33.013 --> 13:35.013
tread the boards
in my time.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.948
Some good, some bad.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.483
But you...?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.119
You're no ventriloquist.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.120
I'm not?

13:42.122 --> 13:45.256
No.    <i>You'</i>an artiste!

13:45.258 --> 13:48.092
To think that one man,
one man,

13:48.094 --> 13:50.862
could do two
such disparate voices.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.130
It's a gift.

13:52.132 --> 13:56.301
You are single-handedly
redefining ventriloquism.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.969
I am only as great

13:57.971 --> 14:01.339
as the people who
notice how great I am.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.778
That act is all me.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.680
I feel so betrayed.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.149
This is worse than
what Judas did to Jesus.

14:12.117 --> 14:14.118
Man, I hope Tammy's here.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.987
Hey, can I see
that wine real quick?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.989
H-Hey! Hope you like red.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.024
Oh, thank you.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.961
You are so thoughtful,
Judas.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.863
Hi, Jesus.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.999
Strike two, Judas!

14:28.001 --> 14:30.935
So, what do you think
of my mustache?

14:30.937 --> 14:34.138
It's black and it stinks,
just like the rest of you.

14:34.140 --> 14:37.041
(laughs) Thank you. Thank you
for laughing at my joke.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.276
I do both voices.
Thank you.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.477
That's it!

14:39.479 --> 14:41.346
I'm sick of you
taking all the credit!

14:41.348 --> 14:43.081
All right, Bean.
That's enough.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.583
You don't want to go
back in your coffin.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.752
You're a no-talent,
credit-hogging hack!

14:47.754 --> 14:50.021
Bean, that's no way
to talk to your dad.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.023
Porque you. You're not my dad.

14:52.025 --> 14:54.926
I only called you that so you'd
take me to the magic show.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.661
No... you meant it.

14:56.663 --> 14:57.929
No, I played you.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.964
You're not my dad,
and you never will be.

14:59.966 --> 15:01.933
Getting a little too real.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.368
Yeah. And sexy.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.636
What?

15:04.638 --> 15:08.006
So then, it was all
just a... just a trick?

15:08.008 --> 15:08.973
That's right.

15:08.975 --> 15:12.377
(pained barking
seal sounds)

15:14.813 --> 15:18.349
Tell me that's not us.

15:19.985 --> 15:22.053
(sobbing)

15:28.627 --> 15:30.128
I'm sure Rallo didn't mean it.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.195
ROBERTA:
He meant it.

15:31.197 --> 15:34.966
See? He'll never
call me "Daddy" again.

15:34.968 --> 15:38.603
Hmm, hmm, soft face.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.805
Good God! Rallo, get in here!

15:40.807 --> 15:42.006
I don't want to see him.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.174
How do I look?

15:43.176 --> 15:45.510
Hey, Mama.
Hey, <i>not</i> Dad.

15:45.512 --> 15:46.978
(sobbing)
Gwah!

15:46.980 --> 15:48.279
Rallo, please tell him

15:48.281 --> 15:51.015
that what you said
was out of anger.

15:51.017 --> 15:54.252
You can see that I am
clearly not angry anymore.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.020
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

15:56.022 --> 15:59.590
You are not my father,
and you never will be.

16:00.759 --> 16:02.293
No! No!

16:02.295 --> 16:03.695
Tell me he didn't say it.

16:03.697 --> 16:04.862
Great news.

16:04.864 --> 16:07.865
I booked Porque and Bean
at The Orpheum Theater.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.100
No show!

16:09.102 --> 16:11.269
There's no porking way
I'm performing

16:11.271 --> 16:13.104
with that has-bean!

16:13.605 --> 16:15.039
That is it.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.941
I have had it up to here.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.077
You two are doing that show.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.278
And not because Junior

16:20.280 --> 16:21.913
put so much effort
into booking it.

16:21.915 --> 16:23.648
And not because the family

16:23.650 --> 16:25.450
could use a few extra bucks
this month.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.820
But because I refuse
to let ventriloquism

16:28.822 --> 16:30.188
tear this family apart.

16:30.190 --> 16:33.524
Not again. Never again.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.694
You two need to learn
to work together as a team.

16:36.696 --> 16:39.998
Not as master and puppet,
but as father and son.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.632
Uh-uh, push on, Mama.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.035
Do it or I'll tell everyone
at school

16:44.037 --> 16:46.004
about your Hello Kitty
cupcake oven.

16:46.006 --> 16:49.007
I just got that
to impress Asian girls.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.541
All right. I'll do it.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.610
Why do you care so much anyway?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.412
A mother's selflessness.

16:54.414 --> 16:58.583
How many blind mice do you
bitches wanna see tonight?!

16:58.585 --> 16:59.817
AUDIENCE:
Three!

16:59.819 --> 17:01.986
(playing "Three Blind Mice")

17:04.156 --> 17:07.125
Sorry, guys, I had to bundle
her act along with yours

17:07.127 --> 17:09.327
or she threatened to stop
making beef stroganoff.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.995
That's all right,
she jammin'.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.031
See how they run!

17:13.033 --> 17:16.034
And just so you know, I am
still not talking to you,

17:16.036 --> 17:17.535
that sentence not included.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.637
I have no problem
talking to you.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.173
Really? Good, because I thought
you weren't talking to me,

17:22.175 --> 17:23.975
so that's why I said
I wasn't talking to you,

17:23.977 --> 17:25.343
even though I wanted
to talk to you,

17:25.345 --> 17:27.111
but I was trying to
act all coolio and...

17:27.113 --> 17:28.746
But I am not talking
to them.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.947
Come again?

17:29.949 --> 17:32.116
You want a puppet, you got one.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.018
I'll move my mouth,
but that's it.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.954
Let's see how good
a ventriloquist you really are.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.122
(gulps)

17:38.124 --> 17:40.124
(applause and cheering)

17:40.126 --> 17:42.527
And now, for the act you've all

17:42.529 --> 17:45.463
inexplicably come to see...

17:45.465 --> 17:48.132
Porque and Bean!

17:48.134 --> 17:49.801
(cheering)

17:49.803 --> 17:54.439
I pray I haven't come all
this way for nothing, Graham.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.040
Trust me, Allister.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.775
You're in for
quite a treat.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.477
(whispers):
Julius, don't look.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.847
That's Allister Monkarsh
sitting behind us.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.148
The Karsh?!

18:05.451 --> 18:06.951
I said don't look.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.253
I hope to intern
for him someday.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.955
A critic's intern.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.790
What a nightmare.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.092
Good evening, folks.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.359
Say, "hello," Bean.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.928
Hello, Bean.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.263
Say, are you trying to do
an impression of me?

18:19.265 --> 18:20.631
Yes, sir.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.101
That's why I sound
very similar to you.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.435
That's pretty good.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.137
You do any other
impressions?

18:26.139 --> 18:27.338
No.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.040
Oh.

18:29.042 --> 18:32.977
So, Bean, anything you have
to say about my appearance?

18:32.979 --> 18:35.680
Yeah, you could stand
to lose a few pounds.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.014
For serious?

18:37.016 --> 18:38.349
No, I'm just joshing.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.652
The only thing you need
to lose is your humility.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.055
(audience booing)

18:45.424 --> 18:47.024
MAN:
I missed my wife's funeral
for this?

18:47.026 --> 18:48.159
MAN 2:
This is a funeral.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.827
MAN 1 (laughs):
Oh, you're bad.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.896
(booing continues)

18:56.835 --> 18:59.103
(clears throat)

18:59.105 --> 19:01.806
Ladies and gentleman,
I have a confession.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.608
You have been lied to.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.909
Don't do this.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.310
No, I have to.

19:06.312 --> 19:09.914
There's only one dummy up here
tonight and that's me.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.184
When you called me "Dad,"
it changed everything.

19:13.186 --> 19:16.954
Every fight we ever had,
every insult you ever made,

19:16.956 --> 19:21.092
every ball of mine you ever
punched was all wiped away.

19:21.094 --> 19:23.961
Because from the moment
I became your dad,

19:23.963 --> 19:28.432
it's become the only thing
that I want to be.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.935
But I already have a dad.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.003
I know that.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.272
But who says
you can't have two?

19:34.274 --> 19:35.473
MAN:
God.

19:35.475 --> 19:38.943
Folks, this boy is why
you're here tonight.

19:38.945 --> 19:42.980
He's been the brains behind
this operation since day one.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.415
He's the talent.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.816
I'm the dummy.

19:45.818 --> 19:49.086
You already used that metaphor,
fat face.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.289
I mean, fat Dad.

19:51.291 --> 19:55.459
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
my boy is back.

19:55.461 --> 19:56.928
Oh, oh, oh.

19:56.930 --> 19:59.931
(sniffing)
Mmm... mmm...

19:59.933 --> 20:02.099
(sniffs)
Mmm...

20:02.101 --> 20:04.202
(cheering)

20:05.137 --> 20:07.772
Hazel, get this down
for the evening edition.

20:07.774 --> 20:11.242
"Even while sobbing,
his lips never moved,

20:11.244 --> 20:15.112
but tongues will be wagging
about Porque and Bean!"

20:15.114 --> 20:18.149
And, uh... yes, that's it.

20:18.151 --> 20:19.951
That's the end of the article.

20:19.953 --> 20:22.420
Junior, rent a bus.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.488
Because this show's
going to Carnegie Hall.

20:24.490 --> 20:25.823
You hear that, Mama?

20:25.825 --> 20:28.092
I'm gonna play
Carnegie Hall.

20:28.094 --> 20:31.028
So screw you, Mama!

20:31.030 --> 20:32.797
(sobbing)

20:32.799 --> 20:35.099
I miss you.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.736
Go ahead.

20:39.705 --> 20:42.206
(audience gasping)

20:43.342 --> 20:45.076
The dummy's come alive!

20:45.078 --> 20:47.345
He'll kill us all!

20:47.347 --> 20:50.715
(panicked screaming)
