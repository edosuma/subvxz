00:00.835 --> 00:02.379
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.587 --> 00:03.672
Must have taken the cure.

00:03.880 --> 00:05.215
Blaine is having
some issue with his memory.

00:05.423 --> 00:06.299
You can't remember anything.

00:06.508 --> 00:09.386
322 people
are suspected zombies.

00:09.594 --> 00:11.012
- You want me to kill them?
- Yes.

00:11.221 --> 00:12.347
You've got
the wrong man for the job.

00:12.555 --> 00:13.682
We do know of one zombie...

00:13.890 --> 00:14.891
Liv Moore.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.101
Got you over a barrel,
big guy.

00:16.309 --> 00:17.227
You're the Chaos Killer.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.604
No one's dead. They're frozen.

00:19.813 --> 00:22.065
<i>I thought that if I could
make Max Rager think that
I was killing them,</i>

00:22.273 --> 00:24.609
you would come up with a cure,
and it would be a big
happy ending for everyone.

00:24.818 --> 00:26.069
- Who's that look like?
- Major.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.362
He's the Chaos Killer.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.030
Stop! Turn around.

00:33.827 --> 00:35.495
I'm here, Ravi.

00:35.704 --> 00:38.456
You were late so
I let myself in with
the hide-a-key.

00:38.665 --> 00:41.793
I did the living room,
but I can't tackle
the kitchen or the closets

00:42.002 --> 00:43.712
until you get back
from the store.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.880
How bad is traffic?

00:46.089 --> 00:48.967
Okay you better hurry,
because this type A brain
won't last forever.

00:49.175 --> 00:52.595
No, this is all wrong, I need
to break it down by genre.

00:52.804 --> 00:53.847
Bye.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.771
FBI, I have a warrant
to search this property.

01:01.980 --> 01:03.314
- Wait...
- Please step aside.

01:03.523 --> 01:04.441
Wha... What?

01:08.028 --> 01:09.154
What are you doing here?

01:09.362 --> 01:11.322
What is going on, Clive?

01:11.531 --> 01:14.826
Last night, Agent Bozzio
arrested Major for
the Chaos Killer murders.

01:15.035 --> 01:16.411
Major? That's insane!

01:16.619 --> 01:18.413
You're going to have
to stay out of the way, Liv.

01:23.418 --> 01:26.296
Serial number 23391.

01:26.504 --> 01:28.381
Call the company
and get the override code.

01:28.590 --> 01:30.633
Moses, check it out.

01:32.343 --> 01:33.303
Body bags.

01:37.599 --> 01:39.225
Fantalyne?

01:39.434 --> 01:41.478
- Where?
- Second bedroom. Sock drawer.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.814
Put it with the rest.

01:50.195 --> 01:53.948
And I present to you,
the smoking gun.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.159
Found it
in the safe, upstairs.

01:59.287 --> 02:03.166
Clive, seriously,
there is no way that
Major is a murderer.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.251
They found
this in Major's safe.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.880
It's a list of names
including all of
the Chaos Killer's victims.

02:09.089 --> 02:11.049
All of those names
have been crossed out.

02:11.257 --> 02:13.885
I don't... Why would he...

02:14.094 --> 02:16.679
Liv, one of the names...

02:18.389 --> 02:19.349
Drake Holloway.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.185
Liv?

02:24.229 --> 02:25.814
Liv, what's going on?

02:26.022 --> 02:27.649
Ravi Chakrabarti, you are
under arrest for possession...

02:27.857 --> 02:29.275
- What!
- ...of a controlled
substance

02:29.484 --> 02:31.027
- and accessory to murder.
- No, that's crazy! Ravi!

02:31.236 --> 02:32.320
You have the right
to remain silent...

02:32.529 --> 02:33.571
Ravi!

02:59.097 --> 03:00.390
So,
shall we start with this?

03:04.269 --> 03:06.187
- Sorry, start what?
- Questioning.

03:06.396 --> 03:08.314
You know how this works.
You work for the police.

03:08.523 --> 03:10.608
The people I work with usually
don't speak much, I'm not...

03:10.817 --> 03:12.777
Ravi. Why was
that in your drawer?

03:12.986 --> 03:14.737
I have no idea.

03:14.946 --> 03:17.365
We found these
under Major's bed.

03:17.574 --> 03:19.159
Do you recognize the brand?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.619
Yes. Medical Plastic four,
industry standard...

03:21.828 --> 03:24.247
The same type used in
the medical examiner's office?

03:24.455 --> 03:26.791
Yes, it's
the industry standard...

03:27.000 --> 03:29.127
How do the same body
bags you use at the morgue

03:29.335 --> 03:30.962
end up under
Mr. Lilywhite's bed?

03:31.171 --> 03:32.172
I have no idea.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.674
Let's talk
about the dog, Ravi.

03:34.883 --> 03:38.011
Major comes home
with a dog one day, right?

03:38.219 --> 03:40.555
A dog you later
learned belonged
to one of the victims.

03:40.763 --> 03:41.681
I...

03:43.141 --> 03:44.601
There was a dog, yeah.

03:44.809 --> 03:46.853
Uh, but it was
returned to its owner.

03:47.061 --> 03:50.899
- I think. I mean,
I wasn't there, I have no...
- No idea?

03:51.107 --> 03:52.650
You asked me about the dog.

03:52.859 --> 03:54.777
You wanted assurance it was
in a good home, didn't you?

03:56.696 --> 04:00.617
Ravi, you haven't
been charged yet,

04:00.825 --> 04:02.952
but if you don't
help us out here,

04:03.161 --> 04:05.747
you're going to find yourself
being charged as an accessory.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.459
Understood.

04:09.667 --> 04:10.793
So, let's start again.

04:13.171 --> 04:14.422
You were telling us
about the dog.

04:18.176 --> 04:20.678
The bodies. Where are they?

04:22.180 --> 04:24.807
Brooding expressions
don't show up on tape.

04:25.016 --> 04:26.059
Use your words.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.477
You think
I killed these people?

04:28.311 --> 04:30.230
Why would I?

04:30.438 --> 04:32.232
You think I'm some
sort of kill-the-rich nut-job?

04:32.440 --> 04:33.441
I don't know. Are you?

04:33.608 --> 04:35.526
No.

04:35.735 --> 04:38.446
So you've got
no bodies and no motive.

04:38.613 --> 04:42.742
So, what motive would
you have for taking out

04:42.951 --> 04:44.827
that guy, for instance?

04:48.289 --> 04:51.542
So it's just a coincidence
that Liv Moore's boyfriend
is one of the victims?

04:51.751 --> 04:53.253
Police officer Drake Holloway?

04:57.715 --> 05:01.177
Remember what I said
about brooding expressions
vis-a-vis the tape?

05:01.386 --> 05:02.762
Yeah, I didn't know...

05:06.432 --> 05:07.809
This must be hard for Liv...

05:08.017 --> 05:09.394
That you
murdered her boyfriend?

05:09.602 --> 05:10.853
Probably.

05:11.062 --> 05:14.274
I...
I told you, I, I...

05:14.482 --> 05:15.900
You, shut your mouth.

05:16.109 --> 05:17.735
You, shut your mouths,
and leave me with my client.

05:19.696 --> 05:21.406
Think about what
we discussed, Mr. Lilywhite.

05:21.614 --> 05:24.033
Don't think about it.
Exit quietly, please.

05:30.081 --> 05:32.000
Okay, wait...

05:32.208 --> 05:34.294
Our mutual friend,
Vaughn Du Clark has
an interest in your case.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.296
Brandt Stone.
You can call me Mr. Stone,

05:36.504 --> 05:38.589
or Washington State
Defense Lawyer of the Year
Brandt Stone,

05:38.798 --> 05:40.091
or don't call me
anything at all, since...

05:40.300 --> 05:41.718
It'll mostly be me talking.

05:41.926 --> 05:44.887
The case is
Oscar the Grouch's
dream house.

05:45.096 --> 05:46.431
It's a pile of garbage, okay?

05:46.639 --> 05:49.434
Serial murder case
with no bodies? Ha.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.019
So, best case scenario,

05:51.227 --> 05:53.813
I call my good friend
Federal Judge Danny Hersh,

05:54.022 --> 05:56.441
the ol' Hershey bar,
he throws this case
into the Puget Sound.

05:56.649 --> 05:57.692
Worst case?

05:57.900 --> 05:58.818
Depends.

06:00.236 --> 06:02.238
Did you do it?

06:02.447 --> 06:04.615
Nah, I'm kidding.
Worst case, you go to trial,

06:04.824 --> 06:06.367
you walk,
'cause there's no bodies.

06:06.576 --> 06:08.786
Either way, you walk.
So, sit tight.

06:08.995 --> 06:10.496
Relax. And most importantly...

06:10.705 --> 06:11.622
Shut your mouth.

06:19.047 --> 06:20.048
<i>It's good to see you.</i>

06:21.632 --> 06:23.259
<i>It's great to see you.
I...</i>

06:24.385 --> 06:25.636
<i>I thought you might not...</i>

06:25.845 --> 06:27.764
<i>Drake Holloway
was my boyfriend.</i>

06:27.972 --> 06:29.974
<i>I'm not supposed
to talk about...</i>

06:30.183 --> 06:31.392
Is he alive?

06:34.979 --> 06:36.606
<i>I didn't do this.</i>

06:36.814 --> 06:38.483
<i>All right, I swear.</i>

06:38.691 --> 06:40.610
I'm sure Drake is fine.
I just...

06:40.818 --> 06:41.736
You should talk to Ravi.

06:43.654 --> 06:45.782
<i>Look, just tell me
that you believe me.</i>

06:48.785 --> 06:49.827
<i>I want to.</i>

06:54.916 --> 06:56.417
<i>Are you okay?</i>

06:56.626 --> 06:58.169
<i>Yeah.</i>

06:58.378 --> 07:00.296
Just, you know...

07:01.631 --> 07:02.590
<i>Hungry.</i>

07:03.716 --> 07:04.759
<i>I do know.</i>

07:10.390 --> 07:12.183
You're out!

07:12.392 --> 07:15.144
Ravi needs a place
to stay while the media
occupies his front yard.

07:15.353 --> 07:16.896
Yeah, of course.

07:17.105 --> 07:19.565
I just can't believe anyone
would think Major did this.

07:19.774 --> 07:20.691
Well...

07:22.485 --> 07:23.820
Ravi?

07:24.028 --> 07:25.238
Major just told me
he's not the Chaos Killer.

07:26.656 --> 07:28.449
He implied
you'd vouch for him.

07:28.658 --> 07:30.326
He is the Chaos Killer, Liv.

07:32.078 --> 07:33.329
He confessed to me.

07:37.458 --> 07:38.626
You recognize this man, Major?

07:39.335 --> 07:40.628
No.

07:40.837 --> 07:42.296
He's Tim Addis.
One of your first victims.

07:43.506 --> 07:44.549
His kids say you trained him

07:44.757 --> 07:46.592
the day before
he went missing.

07:46.801 --> 07:49.053
Tell us where
we can find the bodies.

07:49.262 --> 07:51.139
Give the victim's
families some closure.

07:51.347 --> 07:52.598
He can't tell you that.

07:52.807 --> 07:54.517
My boy has no idea.
And you have 30 hours

07:54.725 --> 07:56.185
to either
charge him or let him go.

07:56.394 --> 07:57.895
Guard!

07:58.104 --> 08:00.648
Now if you don't mind, I need
to get back to my office

08:00.857 --> 08:02.692
and rub ointment
on my Shiba Inu's ass,

08:02.900 --> 08:05.027
'cause some breeder sold
me $1000 dog with mange.

08:05.236 --> 08:07.697
So, if you're looking for
a real crime to go after...

08:07.905 --> 08:09.073
Take my client back to jail.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.327
This conversations is not
getting anybody anywhere.

08:26.716 --> 08:28.968
My boss called this morning.

08:29.177 --> 08:34.474
Reminded me that we've got
a serial murder case with
no bodies and no witnesses.

08:34.682 --> 08:37.810
Juries today, they've seen
every episode of <i>CSI.</i>

08:38.019 --> 08:42.315
They expect fibers,
DNA, spectro... Whatever.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.108
Major's face has
been everywhere.

08:44.317 --> 08:46.652
Maybe a witness will
come forward.

08:46.861 --> 08:48.863
I hear the tip line
has been filling up.

08:49.822 --> 08:51.741
The tip line crazies?

08:51.949 --> 08:53.284
Oh, God...

08:56.370 --> 08:58.873
So, these victims
aren't even dead?

08:59.081 --> 09:01.167
Major didn't kill them?

09:01.375 --> 09:03.044
And he did
all this to protect Liv?

09:03.753 --> 09:04.670
Yeah.

09:04.879 --> 09:06.422
So Drake is still alive?

09:06.631 --> 09:09.342
Frozen and,
as discussed, a zombie,

09:09.550 --> 09:11.427
but yes...

09:11.636 --> 09:14.096
If even one of those
victims came walking back
into civilization,

09:14.305 --> 09:16.766
the FBI's already
circumstantial case
would fall apart.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.184
And with Stone
defending Major...

09:18.392 --> 09:19.894
- Who?
- Brandt Stone.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.647
Great lawyer, total sleaze.
Hits on me constantly.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.899
But yes, if a victim appeared,

09:25.107 --> 09:26.734
he would have the case
thrown out immediately.

09:26.943 --> 09:28.945
Good. 'Cause we need
to get Major out of jail.

09:29.153 --> 09:30.988
If he doesn't
get brains soon...

09:31.197 --> 09:33.449
He'll go full Romero
in a locked building
full of walking food.

09:33.658 --> 09:35.284
Do you know
where the bodies are?

09:35.493 --> 09:36.911
He never told me.

09:37.119 --> 09:39.163
Okay. Here's what
we're going to do.

09:39.372 --> 09:42.333
Ravi, you visit Major,
find out where the bodies are.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.210
I'll try and get us
some brains.

09:45.962 --> 09:46.921
Okay.

09:49.549 --> 09:51.634
Let's stop
this zombie apocalypse.

09:53.052 --> 09:55.263
Brains. Brains.
The magical food.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.807
The more you eat,
the less you brood.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.560
You just may be saving
humanity here, Blaine.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.145
And I'm human, for the moment.

10:03.354 --> 10:04.897
So maybe
it's just self-interest.

10:06.482 --> 10:08.693
How does primo
yoga instructor brain sound?

10:08.901 --> 10:11.654
What the hell, Blaine?

10:11.862 --> 10:14.574
Our friend from the morgue
has been cut off
from her brain supply.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.617
She needs a loaner
to tide her over.

10:16.826 --> 10:18.619
Something about
the apocalypse?

10:18.828 --> 10:20.204
Hmm. You know
the so-called Chaos Killer...

10:20.413 --> 10:21.581
Yeah!

10:21.789 --> 10:23.374
They caught the zombie
killing son-of-a-bitch!

10:23.583 --> 10:25.001
Yeah, well.
He's a zombie himself,

10:25.209 --> 10:27.169
and if he doesn't
get out of jail soon,

10:27.378 --> 10:29.755
he's going to get his brains
the old fashioned zombie way.

10:29.964 --> 10:31.757
24 hours later,

10:31.966 --> 10:33.801
you'll be the savvy
businessmen selling
sand in the Sahara.

10:33.968 --> 10:34.969
Oh, God.

10:35.845 --> 10:37.555
Okay. I get it.

10:37.763 --> 10:38.931
You can have all you need.

10:39.140 --> 10:40.725
Great. Thank you.

10:40.933 --> 10:42.351
Just sign up
for the brain plan.
25 grand a month.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.021
We now take Bitcoin.

10:45.229 --> 10:47.398
I can bring you a brain
in return in a couple days.

10:47.607 --> 10:50.276
It's not brain friends,
Liv, it's brain business.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.737
You did hear the part about
the apocalypse, didn't you?

10:52.945 --> 10:53.946
Sure did.

10:54.155 --> 10:55.573
That's what's called leverage.

10:55.781 --> 10:57.491
I'd think preventing
the end of the world is worth

10:57.700 --> 10:58.576
25 grand.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.119
I don't have that.

11:00.328 --> 11:01.329
Come back when you do.

11:07.877 --> 11:09.879
So... Hello.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.591
<i>How's jail?</i>

11:13.799 --> 11:15.509
Well, the food's not
quite to my taste.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.219
<i>Right. Um...</i>

11:17.428 --> 11:18.304
<i>Liv's looking into that.</i>

11:18.512 --> 11:20.181
<i>Thank you.</i>

11:21.891 --> 11:24.226
<i>So, the reason for my visit...</i>

11:25.686 --> 11:27.980
Um...

11:28.189 --> 11:32.777
<i>I...</i>
<i>...actually wanted
to ask you about, a um...</i>

11:32.985 --> 11:34.153
<i>video game thing.</i>

11:35.196 --> 11:36.447
<i>Video game?</i>

11:36.656 --> 11:40.868
<i>I'm playing that
zombie game we play?</i>

11:41.077 --> 11:42.578
<i>And I'm stuck.</i>

11:42.787 --> 11:47.083
Um, and I have to get
to the, uh, frozen zone...

11:47.291 --> 11:48.876
<i>Where everything's frozen...</i>

11:50.086 --> 11:51.420
<i>What game is this?</i>

11:51.629 --> 11:53.547
<i>Zombie... Town?</i>

11:54.840 --> 11:57.927
<i>Oh. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

11:58.135 --> 11:59.387
<i>Zombie Town.</i>

11:59.595 --> 12:01.430
<i>Yeah. I need to find
the frozen zombies</i>

12:01.639 --> 12:03.474
<i>to beat the level, but I don't
know how to get there.</i>

12:03.683 --> 12:05.226
<i>Right. Right.</i>

12:05.434 --> 12:08.062
<i>Um, the frozen zone.</i>

12:09.772 --> 12:12.483
Okay, what you have to do,

12:12.692 --> 12:15.736
<i>is go to the edge</i>

12:15.945 --> 12:18.030
<i>of water...</i>

12:20.741 --> 12:21.617
<i>World.</i>

12:21.826 --> 12:23.494
<i>Edge of water world?</i>

12:23.703 --> 12:24.745
<i>Yeah. On 15th.</i>

12:26.580 --> 12:28.791
<i>Level. 15th level.</i>

12:28.999 --> 12:30.543
<i>You might want
to jot this down.</i>

12:42.638 --> 12:43.764
This has to be it.

12:43.973 --> 12:45.307
Only storage
facility on the water.

12:45.516 --> 12:46.434
Shed 15.

12:46.642 --> 12:47.768
Yes. This is it.

12:49.270 --> 12:51.021
Okay, we just
need to find Drake,

12:51.230 --> 12:52.815
get him thawed out,

12:53.023 --> 12:55.484
and come up with a story so
he can reappear to the police.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.117
No...

13:12.126 --> 13:13.252
Where are all the bodies?

13:15.254 --> 13:16.422
They appear to be gone.

13:22.261 --> 13:24.180
I... I don't understand.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.556
They should be here.

13:25.765 --> 13:27.141
Someone found them.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.185
Who even knew to look?

13:29.393 --> 13:30.311
Max Rager.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.522
Vaughn hired
Major to kill them.

13:33.731 --> 13:36.317
Major said they were
always keeping tabs on him.

13:36.525 --> 13:39.487
They must've found out
Major was keeping
the Chaos Killer victims here

13:39.695 --> 13:41.864
and taken them
back to, well...

13:42.072 --> 13:43.157
Finish them off.

13:44.283 --> 13:45.659
Like they always intended.

13:48.162 --> 13:49.038
Drake...

13:49.246 --> 13:50.998
I'm so sorry, Liv.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.129
Major isn't the only
hungry zombie, Ravi.

13:57.338 --> 13:59.465
I'm barely
keeping it together.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.550
Let's focus on goals...

14:01.759 --> 14:04.887
How 'bout we see if we can
sneak a brain from the morgue?

14:05.095 --> 14:07.681
I think I may
just drive around
for a bit.

14:08.891 --> 14:09.975
I just...

14:11.143 --> 14:12.394
I just need some alone time.

14:13.145 --> 14:14.104
I understand.

14:15.231 --> 14:17.316
I'll, I'll leave you to it.

14:25.825 --> 14:27.076
All right. Come on, Ed.

14:28.494 --> 14:29.745
C'mon, you got it,
Ed! One more.

14:31.747 --> 14:35.167
100! Yeah!

14:35.376 --> 14:36.418
Okay.

14:36.627 --> 14:38.128
What was your
previous best, Ed?

14:38.337 --> 14:39.213
Six!

14:41.715 --> 14:43.259
And that's...

14:43.467 --> 14:46.595
What one can
of SuperMax can do for you!

14:46.804 --> 14:49.223
<i>Though watching Ed
crank out 100 pushups
was a hoot,</i>

14:49.431 --> 14:51.267
<i>I can assure you
we've done our own testing.</i>

14:51.475 --> 14:52.852
I've got another can here.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.979
Want to see me rip a Seattle
phone book in half?

14:55.187 --> 14:57.106
<i>You've won
the case, counselor.
Get out of the courtroom.</i>

14:57.314 --> 14:59.358
You know what, I, I'm sorry
I dropped out of law school.

14:59.567 --> 15:00.985
But I assume
that euphemism means...

15:01.193 --> 15:02.528
<i>We'll buy it.</i>

15:02.736 --> 15:05.030
<i>The company, your factory,
labs, all of it.</i>

15:05.239 --> 15:06.699
<i>And the SuperMax
formula, of course.</i>

15:08.158 --> 15:09.076
Sorry!

15:09.952 --> 15:11.996
This is great.

15:12.204 --> 15:15.416
A private military contractor
buying my little energy
drink business.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.919
Hoo! So, um, now...

15:19.128 --> 15:20.713
What can we expect?

15:20.921 --> 15:23.883
A new generation
of SuperMax fueled
super-soldiers,

15:24.091 --> 15:26.802
making the world's hotspots
safe for capitalism, hmm?

15:27.011 --> 15:28.637
<i>Don't worry your
pretty head about it.</i>

15:28.846 --> 15:31.223
<i>I'll sign over
the billion dollar check
as soon as I'm sure</i>

15:31.432 --> 15:34.852
<i>that the product isn't
getting blamed for a certain
serial killer's actions.</i>

15:35.060 --> 15:38.230
<i>I don't want
your dirty laundry
becoming my dirty laundry.</i>

15:38.439 --> 15:41.108
Always with figurative
language, this one.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.778
Yeah, just give me
one second.

15:48.365 --> 15:51.827
Phew, what a beast.

15:52.036 --> 15:54.580
So, how's Brandt doing
with Major's case?

15:54.788 --> 15:55.998
Arraignment's tomorrow.

15:56.206 --> 15:57.541
He says he can get
the charges dropped or,

15:57.750 --> 16:00.252
worst case, bail by then.

16:00.461 --> 16:02.755
You know, I think
this has gone on
long enough, don't you?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.174
When Major's out,

16:05.382 --> 16:08.218
have him and Liv Moore
put down, okay?

16:08.427 --> 16:09.845
Thought you'd never ask.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.785
Excuse me. Sir?

16:34.286 --> 16:35.245
Oh, hi.

16:35.996 --> 16:36.997
I just...

16:37.206 --> 16:38.832
I know I'm on suspension,

16:39.041 --> 16:42.795
but I still have,
um, files to update.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.297
You're Dr. Chakrabarti.

16:45.506 --> 16:47.383
I'm sorry, you're not
allowed to be in here.

16:47.591 --> 16:48.717
Right.

16:48.926 --> 16:51.178
Sorry, I misunderstood.

16:51.387 --> 16:52.346
Okay, good luck to you.

16:53.639 --> 16:57.059
Oh, Doctor, while you're here.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.894
Someone called
for you while you were out.

16:59.937 --> 17:01.146
Oh. Okay.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.356
Yes, thank you.

17:03.983 --> 17:05.901
Hey, Chakrabarti...

17:06.110 --> 17:07.486
What's the deal with the rats?

17:09.446 --> 17:14.284
According to my research,
the real culprit is the NSA.

17:14.493 --> 17:17.037
Yeah. They use the cell phone
network to control minds,

17:17.246 --> 17:20.457
so, maybe Major Lilywhite
is the killer,

17:20.666 --> 17:22.084
but I can prove
he's merely a patsy

17:22.292 --> 17:25.004
in a conspiracy to create
the perfect assassin.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.547
Okay, Duane.

17:26.755 --> 17:27.923
Thanks for coming in.

17:28.132 --> 17:29.008
I'll look into it.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.342
Okay, great.

17:35.431 --> 17:37.391
I was never here.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.442
Tip line oddballs, huh?

17:47.401 --> 17:48.777
I have no choice.

17:48.986 --> 17:51.488
I need to chase
every possible lead

17:51.697 --> 17:53.449
if I'm going
to make this case stick.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.617
Message for you, Detective.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.786
Some guy in county jail.
Says it's important.

17:57.995 --> 17:59.538
- Who is he?
- Don't know.

17:59.747 --> 18:02.166
Said he saw the Meat Cute
guy on T.V. and wants to talk.

18:08.547 --> 18:09.965
So, you saw
Mr. Lilywhite on T.V.

18:10.174 --> 18:12.092
<i>and decided
to reach out, because...</i>

18:12.301 --> 18:14.303
Because you were
the only one that didn't
buy that hero-cop theory.

18:14.511 --> 18:15.846
<i>And you wanted
to say good job?</i>

18:16.055 --> 18:17.598
<i>I wanted to help.</i>

18:17.765 --> 18:21.351
<i>See, I'm the guy who sold
the guy the guns he used.</i>

18:21.560 --> 18:22.728
<i>You sold guns
to Major Lilywhite?</i>

18:22.936 --> 18:24.980
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:25.189 --> 18:27.441
<i>And let me guess,
you want a deal in exchange
for your testimony.</i>

18:28.317 --> 18:30.402
Yeah.

18:30.611 --> 18:33.864
<i>We never told the press
what weapons were used, so how
about you enlighten me.</i>

18:34.073 --> 18:34.990
Let's see...

18:35.199 --> 18:37.034
Smith and Wesson 44.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.369
Grizzly 12 gauge...

18:39.578 --> 18:41.246
I even sold
the guy a hand grenade.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.084
<i>About that deal...</i>

18:48.212 --> 18:50.089
Mrs. Dillon. I'm Agent Bozzio.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.507
What do you have to tell me?

18:51.715 --> 18:54.343
Oh, it's not me,
it's my daughter, Kayla.

18:54.551 --> 18:56.178
See, we live in Olympic Hills.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.347
Tim Addis was
our next door neighbor.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.807
Tim Addis. Victim number two.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.976
Yes. It's so terrible.

19:03.185 --> 19:08.232
See, I'd noticed Kayla
was acting a bit off
for the past few months,

19:08.440 --> 19:10.567
out at all hours,
doing poorly in school,

19:10.776 --> 19:12.694
not the Kayla I know.

19:12.903 --> 19:14.947
So we finally talked about it,

19:15.155 --> 19:17.449
and well...

19:17.658 --> 19:19.535
Kayla, tell Agent Bozzio.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.329
Well, like, the night
Mr. Addis disappeared?

19:24.540 --> 19:26.959
I was in my bedroom,
and I kind of looked out,

19:27.167 --> 19:31.964
and I saw, like, this man,

19:32.172 --> 19:36.260
and he was putting a body
in the trunk of his car.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.846
It was that guy
that they've been
showing on the news.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.223
Kayla, why are you
only bringing this
to our attention now?

19:41.431 --> 19:44.393
God! Because I was
freaked out and scared, okay?

19:44.601 --> 19:46.395
I mean, like,
what if he tried to kill me?

19:46.603 --> 19:47.813
I couldn't study.

19:48.021 --> 19:50.357
I didn't want
to come home, like, ever.

19:52.776 --> 19:53.861
Okay.

19:55.863 --> 19:59.366
Kayla, I want you to tell me
everything about that night.

19:59.533 --> 20:00.576
Everything you saw.

20:02.452 --> 20:04.288
Good, you got my message.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.415
Luckily I stopped
by the morgue.
We came as soon as we could.

20:06.623 --> 20:07.583
You've looked better.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.084
Rough couple of days.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.711
They're having
a party downstairs,

20:10.919 --> 20:12.546
so if we stay quiet,
I don't think they'll notice.

20:12.754 --> 20:13.714
Come on.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.428
Look, I felt bad I couldn't
help you out before, so...

20:22.764 --> 20:23.765
This is a brain.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.475
I don't know who it came from,

20:25.684 --> 20:28.061
but it seems like it's an
any brain a storm situation.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.063
Blaine, I...

20:33.108 --> 20:35.360
- Thank you.
- Hey. I know
what's at stake here.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.070
Who needs a zombie
apocalypse, right?

20:37.738 --> 20:38.822
Right.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.949
Definitely.

20:41.158 --> 20:43.285
Ew. Just save some for Major,

20:43.493 --> 20:47.122
his bail hearing's
this afternoon.

20:47.331 --> 20:50.292
We've just learned
that, on the strength
of new witness evidence,

20:50.500 --> 20:53.503
Major Lilywhite has been
charged with
the Chaos killings,

20:53.712 --> 20:55.255
and has been released on bail,

20:55.464 --> 20:57.466
paid, it seems,
by his employer.

21:06.183 --> 21:08.018
Okay, almost there.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.147
Ravi's waiting
for us in the car,

21:12.356 --> 21:14.608
and there's a nice
shake with your name on it.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.486
Okay.

21:17.694 --> 21:20.322
- Just down the steps,
another 100 feet...

21:20.530 --> 21:21.949
...and we're home free.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.992
Sure. Thank you, Liv.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.876
Almost there. Almost there...

21:36.505 --> 21:39.841
- Oh, excuse us, we...
- Major Lilywhite,
you're under arrest...

21:41.176 --> 21:42.552
Clive, what're you...

21:42.761 --> 21:44.304
You're under arrest
for the Meat Cute murders.

21:44.513 --> 21:46.306
You have
the right to remain silent.

21:46.515 --> 21:49.226
Anything you say can and
will be used against you
in the court of law.

21:49.434 --> 21:50.936
You have the right
to an attorney.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.521
If you cannot
afford an attorney,

21:52.729 --> 21:54.189
one will be
provided for you...

21:54.398 --> 21:56.650
Are you involved
in the Meat Cute murders?

22:02.572 --> 22:06.618
Detective, I don't
even know where to begin.

22:06.827 --> 22:08.370
The constitution, maybe?

22:08.578 --> 22:10.872
Arresting my client again
after he's just been charged?

22:11.081 --> 22:13.125
That is textbook
cruel and unusual.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.876
I mean, look at him.
Look at my client.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.628
He looks like a...

22:16.837 --> 22:19.006
...day-old dog dump.
No offense.

22:19.214 --> 22:22.342
Bryce Buellton.
Name ring a bell?

22:22.551 --> 22:24.219
Inmate at King County.

22:24.428 --> 22:26.930
Claims he sold you some items.

22:27.139 --> 22:29.766
A Grizzly 12 gauge.
Smith and Wesson 44.

22:29.975 --> 22:31.935
A hand grenade.

22:32.144 --> 22:34.021
All of which match
shells and slugs found at

22:34.229 --> 22:36.315
- the Meat Cute massacre site.
- Okay, slow down a second,

22:36.523 --> 22:37.941
I'm just getting up
to speed here, just slow down.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.651
Which is interesting,
because I also had them test

22:39.860 --> 22:42.029
some urine found
in the Meat Cute freezer,

22:42.237 --> 22:43.155
and guess what?

22:44.948 --> 22:46.742
It matched your DNA.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.910
You're saying my client
shot up a butcher shop
and peed in the freezer?

22:49.119 --> 22:52.414
You used to do social work,
isn't that right, Major?

22:52.622 --> 22:54.249
- Working with troubled kids?
- Don't answer that.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.209
Yeah.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.253
And several of your
kids wound up dead,
isn't that right?

23:00.422 --> 23:02.049
There was a kid
in the Meat Cute freezer,

23:03.258 --> 23:04.593
his brain missing.

23:05.677 --> 23:06.803
He was one of yours...

23:07.012 --> 23:08.430
Missing brain? What?

23:08.638 --> 23:11.058
That's come up a lot. Brains.

23:11.266 --> 23:14.436
Missing brains.
Brains in people's freezers.

23:14.644 --> 23:16.563
Here's my theory.

23:16.772 --> 23:19.900
There's some kind
of weird brain cult out there,

23:20.108 --> 23:23.153
they killed some of your kids,
you went after them.

23:23.362 --> 23:25.364
Okay, can we just get
Jules Verne in here?

23:25.572 --> 23:29.117
Because I'm only
licensed to practice law
in this dimension, all right?

23:29.326 --> 23:31.787
What the hell
is he talking about?
Don't answer that.

23:31.995 --> 23:34.373
I want you to think about
your next move, Major.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.125
This case is different.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.002
We've got bodies.
We've got DNA.

23:39.211 --> 23:40.670
We've got witnesses.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.130
I think we've got you.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.425
So just, think about it.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.268
Big day, huh?

23:58.230 --> 24:00.273
Understatement of the year.

24:01.983 --> 24:03.985
So why're you burning
the midnight oil?

24:04.194 --> 24:07.322
We're going to get
him one way or another.

24:07.531 --> 24:11.785
Or is this some bid to get me
alone in the bullpen at night?

24:11.993 --> 24:13.995
- Which I'm fine
with, I might add.

24:19.668 --> 24:22.879
So Kayla Dillon said she saw
Major putting Tim Addis' body

24:23.088 --> 24:25.173
into a car from
her bedroom window.

24:26.341 --> 24:28.301
We took this angle yesterday.

24:29.261 --> 24:30.679
But this...

24:30.887 --> 24:33.098
Is a screen grab
from a news report last year,

24:33.306 --> 24:35.434
when Tim Addis
was first reported missing.

24:36.977 --> 24:40.188
That is Kayla's window.

24:40.397 --> 24:43.942
They only pruned away these
branches a few months ago.

24:44.151 --> 24:46.153
I don't think Kayla
could've seen what she saw.

24:47.237 --> 24:49.364
Best guess?

24:49.573 --> 24:51.992
The girl is making it
all up as an excuse
for her own bad behavior.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.036
Defense would have
a field day with this
if they knew about it.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.539
Oh, hence, burning
the midnight oil.

24:58.623 --> 25:00.792
I feel it, Clive.

25:01.001 --> 25:02.169
I know you know the feeling.

25:02.377 --> 25:03.753
He's the guy.

25:03.962 --> 25:06.506
Judge gave you two
months to connect the dots.

25:07.215 --> 25:08.133
You'll get him.

25:08.341 --> 25:09.259
Or you will.

25:11.094 --> 25:13.263
Your case seems
pretty damn solid.

25:14.890 --> 25:16.099
Wonder twin powers.

25:27.736 --> 25:29.738
<i>Okay, so,
one mystery solved.</i>

25:29.946 --> 25:32.407
<i>Apparently, this brain
belonged to a drummer.</i>

25:32.616 --> 25:34.784
<i>Just as well, because
I have pretty much nothing</i>

25:34.993 --> 25:36.369
<i>but nervous energy these days.</i>

25:43.001 --> 25:44.628
Liv. You have company.

25:45.295 --> 25:46.338
Clive?

25:48.256 --> 25:49.841
Could we have a moment alone?

25:52.344 --> 25:53.553
Yeah, sure.

25:57.098 --> 25:58.767
What's up?

25:58.975 --> 26:02.270
I'm here as a courtesy, Liv.

26:02.479 --> 26:05.398
Because we're friends,
and things are about
to get complicated.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.734
More complicated
than they are now?

26:07.943 --> 26:09.361
My case
against Major is solid.

26:10.779 --> 26:12.113
We have his DNA at the scene,

26:12.322 --> 26:14.282
we have the witness
who sold him the guns,

26:14.491 --> 26:15.575
we have plausible motive.

26:17.619 --> 26:18.995
You are his only alibi.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.999
You haven't been deposed yet,
but when this gets going,

26:23.208 --> 26:25.293
you are going
to get hammered hard.

26:25.502 --> 26:27.295
It's going to be rough.

26:27.504 --> 26:29.756
So what I came
here to say is this,

26:31.424 --> 26:32.676
think it over.

26:34.177 --> 26:35.929
Then think it over again.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.305
If there's
anything you left out,

26:37.514 --> 26:38.640
anything else you want to say,

26:38.848 --> 26:41.101
now's the time to come clean.

26:41.309 --> 26:44.688
Clive, I told you,
he was with me.

26:44.896 --> 26:46.147
I'm not here to discuss it.

26:46.356 --> 26:49.109
I just wanted to advise
you to think about it.

26:51.278 --> 26:52.237
As a friend.

26:55.073 --> 26:56.032
Goodnight, Liv.

27:11.339 --> 27:12.382
<i>Oh, Major...</i>

27:13.174 --> 27:14.134
<i>Hey.</i>

27:14.342 --> 27:16.177
<i>So Clive came to see me,</i>

27:16.386 --> 27:19.431
<i>and he pretty much said
that he doesn't think
my alibi will hold up.</i>

27:19.639 --> 27:21.600
<i>Liv, look at me.</i>

27:23.226 --> 27:24.811
<i>You need to get me the cure.</i>

27:25.437 --> 27:26.396
<i>Soon.</i>

27:27.480 --> 27:29.107
<i>Very soon.</i>

27:29.316 --> 27:30.442
<i>Major, I mean about the case,</i>

27:30.650 --> 27:32.861
<i>and getting you
something decent to eat.</i>

27:33.069 --> 27:35.322
It's too late
for that, Liv. All right?

27:35.530 --> 27:40.702
<i>It's taking everything
I have to stay myself,</i>

27:40.910 --> 27:43.788
<i>and if I'm not myself
in here, it'll be bad.</i>

27:43.997 --> 27:45.248
Major, no.

27:45.457 --> 27:47.375
<i>No. We can't.</i>

27:47.584 --> 27:49.794
<i>It wipes away your memory,
everything...</i>

27:50.003 --> 27:51.504
<i>You have
to make a choice, Liv,</i>

27:53.298 --> 27:55.175
'cause we're going to lose
me one way or the other,

27:57.177 --> 28:00.180
<i>and we both know
one way is a lot worse.</i>

28:01.890 --> 28:04.392
Please, Liv.

28:12.776 --> 28:16.738
<i>No. No.
I'll think of something.</i>

28:16.946 --> 28:18.740
<i>We're going to work it out.
You're going to be fine.</i>

28:18.948 --> 28:20.367
<i>I don't agree, Liv.</i>

28:20.575 --> 28:22.285
I'll figure something out.
You're going to be fine.

28:44.224 --> 28:45.975
And this is, what exactly?

28:46.184 --> 28:48.144
Chocolate-covered
brain nougat.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.146
We have to get Major
brains by tomorrow morning,

28:50.355 --> 28:51.272
or we're in serious trouble.

28:51.481 --> 28:52.857
Like, all of us, in the world.

28:53.066 --> 28:54.275
I'm aware.

28:54.484 --> 28:57.112
Have you considered
maybe he's right?

28:57.320 --> 28:59.823
Maybe the cure
is our only shot.

29:00.031 --> 29:02.951
No. No, the Major we know
would be gone. No.

29:05.954 --> 29:07.455
There.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.124
A perfectly
innocent fitness bar.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.459
All we have to do is get
Brandt to give it to Major,

29:11.668 --> 29:13.294
and we've
bought ourselves time.

29:13.503 --> 29:16.172
What do you mean, "we"?

29:20.343 --> 29:22.721
A little bird around
the courthouse said you
wanted to see me?

29:22.929 --> 29:23.888
I did.

29:24.806 --> 29:27.142
I wanted to ask a favor.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.853
Your client,
Major Lilywhite, is a friend.

29:30.061 --> 29:33.148
Fitness trainer.
He's on a strict diet regimen,

29:33.356 --> 29:35.483
and jail has not
been easy on him,
as you may have noticed.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.610
Yeah, he does seem
a little less than 100%.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.738
Around 3%.

29:39.946 --> 29:41.698
I'm afraid he might keel
over before I get him off.

29:41.906 --> 29:43.992
Amino acid imbalance.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.785
I was hoping
you could get him this.

29:47.370 --> 29:51.666
Before anyone gets anyone off.

29:51.875 --> 29:54.377
- Amino acids, huh?
- Mmm-hmm.

29:54.586 --> 29:56.629
Yeah, I'll consider it.

29:56.796 --> 29:59.048
If you'll agree to have
a drink with me later.

29:59.257 --> 30:02.218
Quid Pro Quo, Bernice.

30:03.762 --> 30:05.346
<i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

30:05.555 --> 30:08.057
I think it's Clarice, but...

30:08.266 --> 30:10.769
Okay, Quid Pro Quo.

30:13.438 --> 30:15.190
I choose the venue.
Two drink minimum.

30:15.857 --> 30:17.901
Yeah.

30:18.109 --> 30:20.153
Pleasure doing
business with you, Counselor.

30:22.113 --> 30:24.073
And remember,
two drinks minimum,

30:24.282 --> 30:25.950
I'm a stickler
for the fine print.

30:30.371 --> 30:32.499
Okay.
So, let's get started.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.794
What I want to review is...

30:36.002 --> 30:38.087
Uh, before we start,
Detective, do you mind
if I give my client something?

30:38.296 --> 30:40.799
He's a fitness guy
on a regimented diet,

30:41.007 --> 30:43.802
and he's gone days without
his essential amino acids.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.261
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

30:45.470 --> 30:47.055
He's clearly lacking
some vitamin or other.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.681
Here you go.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.350
Your friend Peyton said
this is the kind you like.

30:52.185 --> 30:54.229
Ah. Atta boy.

30:54.437 --> 30:57.190
Kid clearly needs
his essential amino acids.

30:57.398 --> 30:58.316
Eat it up.

31:02.195 --> 31:03.404
What's wrong?

31:03.613 --> 31:04.781
Isn't that the kind you like?

31:05.907 --> 31:07.033
My friend gave you this?

31:07.242 --> 31:09.202
Yeah. I mean,
not that exact one.

31:09.410 --> 31:11.412
My Shiba Inu ate
the one she gave me.

31:11.621 --> 31:13.706
But I got you the same kind.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.125
You know, I didn't remember
if she gave me Choco-nilla nut
or Choco-nilla,

31:16.334 --> 31:19.462
so I went with
just Choco-nilla,
in case of nut allergies.

31:19.671 --> 31:23.091
Last thing I need's
a lawsuit, am I right?

31:23.299 --> 31:25.134
You mean Major didn't
get the bar I made?

31:29.264 --> 31:32.141
No, you did all you can.
Thanks, Peyton.

31:33.268 --> 31:34.894
No. There's no more time.

31:35.645 --> 31:36.896
Okay. Bye.

31:44.946 --> 31:46.281
Hey.

31:46.489 --> 31:50.159
Liv. I wasn't really
expecting company.

31:50.368 --> 31:51.911
You said I should
think things over.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.037
I did.

31:54.122 --> 31:55.415
I'm ready to come clean.

31:56.958 --> 31:57.917
Come in.

32:10.388 --> 32:11.347
Okay.

32:13.725 --> 32:16.686
Major is responsible
for the Chaos Killer
disappearances

32:16.895 --> 32:18.104
and the Meat Cute killings.

32:19.063 --> 32:20.023
Okay.

32:21.649 --> 32:23.526
- And were you witness to...
- Let me finish.

32:23.735 --> 32:24.777
This is a whole thing.

32:26.821 --> 32:27.989
Major...

32:29.365 --> 32:30.325
Is a zombie.

32:32.201 --> 32:34.370
- Metaphorically?
- Literally.

32:37.498 --> 32:42.003
A zombie?
Like, <i>Dawn of the Dead,</i>
eating people?

32:42.211 --> 32:44.923
Brains, specifically.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.508
If zombies can feed
regularly on human brains,

32:47.717 --> 32:50.345
they can stay
more or less functional.

32:50.553 --> 32:53.014
I've been feeding
Major from the morgue.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.516
If they don't
get brains, then, yes,
it's <i>Dawn of the Dead,</i>

32:55.725 --> 32:57.810
<i>28 Days Later, World War Z.</i>
Take your pick.

32:59.646 --> 33:02.398
Those runaway kids who were
going missing last year?

33:02.607 --> 33:06.319
They were victims of a network
selling brains to zombies.

33:06.527 --> 33:07.570
It was headquartered
out of Meat Cute.

33:07.779 --> 33:08.905
The massacre?

33:09.113 --> 33:10.490
That was Major
taking them down.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.161
Forgive me, Liv,

33:16.746 --> 33:18.164
but are you on something?

33:18.373 --> 33:21.668
- I know the stress...
- Clive, I'm a zombie, too.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.381
I got scratched at
the Lake Washington
boat party massacre.

33:28.091 --> 33:29.258
And I turned.

33:29.467 --> 33:30.635
Like Major.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.261
I keep myself
from turning all the way

33:32.470 --> 33:34.597
with brains from the morgue.

33:34.806 --> 33:36.516
That's where
my visions come from,

33:36.724 --> 33:39.394
I feel our victim's
personalities,

33:39.602 --> 33:42.480
I experience their memories.

33:42.689 --> 33:45.650
And I'm telling you this now,
because Major has been
locked up without brains,

33:45.858 --> 33:47.485
and he's going to turn.

33:47.694 --> 33:49.529
And if he turns,
he'll infect everyone
in that jail,

33:49.737 --> 33:51.364
it will spread out of control.

33:51.572 --> 33:53.700
You need to let him out.

33:53.908 --> 33:56.244
If you don't,
by some time tomorrow,

33:56.452 --> 33:58.788
we could be
looking at the beginning
of the end of the world.

34:00.665 --> 34:02.208
I'm sorry, Liv, but...

34:04.002 --> 34:05.086
I don't believe you.

34:05.795 --> 34:07.255
I mean, I can't.

34:07.463 --> 34:08.381
I mean...

34:09.590 --> 34:10.550
You want me...

34:11.759 --> 34:12.760
Liv...

34:14.679 --> 34:15.888
Liv, Liv, what are you doing?

34:39.787 --> 34:40.955
Do you believe me now?

35:27.335 --> 35:29.253
Major Lilywhite
was released last night.

35:29.921 --> 35:30.880
I know.

35:36.969 --> 35:39.555
It seems somehow Brandt Stone
got wind of the problems

35:39.764 --> 35:41.140
with Kayla Dillon's
witness testimony.

35:41.349 --> 35:42.517
Called the judge
in the middle of the night,

35:42.725 --> 35:44.268
got the whole
case dropped.

35:44.477 --> 35:45.728
I'm having
a hard time figuring out

35:45.937 --> 35:47.271
who else but you
could have tipped him off.

35:49.482 --> 35:51.484
They didn't just drop
the Chaos Killer charges.

35:51.692 --> 35:54.070
They dropped your case, too.

35:54.278 --> 35:55.822
Something about
a tainted witness,

35:56.030 --> 35:59.283
and signs of the DNA evidence
having been tampered with.

36:00.701 --> 36:02.703
I guess
I just have to know, Clive.

36:02.912 --> 36:03.996
What the hell are you doing?

36:04.205 --> 36:05.331
Dale, I...

36:06.833 --> 36:08.376
It's hard to explain...

36:08.584 --> 36:09.961
You've got to know you just
blew up both of our cases.

36:10.795 --> 36:12.421
Your career...

36:12.630 --> 36:14.757
You can kiss any hope
you had of getting into
the FBI goodbye.

36:16.259 --> 36:18.052
Just, why?

36:19.637 --> 36:21.264
New evidence
came to light.

36:21.472 --> 36:23.516
You know the feeling.

36:23.724 --> 36:25.268
He's not the guy. I just...

36:25.977 --> 36:26.936
Know it.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.814
That's the best
I'm going to get?

36:31.691 --> 36:33.276
You're throwing
everything away,

36:33.484 --> 36:36.821
your case, your career. Me.

36:38.948 --> 36:39.991
Just because?

36:42.535 --> 36:43.578
That's all you have?

36:47.707 --> 36:49.542
I don't understand.

36:49.750 --> 36:52.170
And it looks like
I probably never will.

36:56.299 --> 36:57.383
Goodbye, Clive.

37:12.690 --> 37:13.774
Hello, body.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.403
Hello, beakers.

37:17.612 --> 37:20.198
Hello, bone saw!

37:23.159 --> 37:24.660
Hello, Ravi.

37:24.869 --> 37:26.704
Yes, I am here,

37:26.913 --> 37:30.333
and who knew I'd ever
be this excited to be
back in a morgue?

37:30.541 --> 37:32.835
Yes, the rats
are in fine shape,

37:33.044 --> 37:35.296
the aneurism hook
is looking sharp,

37:35.504 --> 37:37.840
the sutures are fresh...

37:38.049 --> 37:41.302
I don't mean to be funny,
but this drummer
whose brain I ate...

37:46.098 --> 37:48.476
Good, yes, wonderful,

37:48.684 --> 37:49.894
but listen,
I'm in line for coffee,

37:50.102 --> 37:51.938
you want me
to bring you anything? Tea?

37:52.146 --> 37:54.440
There's an undefined
pastry item?

37:54.649 --> 37:55.733
Bagel?

37:55.942 --> 37:57.610
There's onion,
poppy, blueberry...

37:59.403 --> 38:00.404
Liv?

38:01.656 --> 38:02.823
Liv?

38:14.752 --> 38:18.214
Sorry, man.
I'm collecting this one for
Wollochet Funeral Home.

38:18.422 --> 38:20.591
The girl signed for it inside.

38:20.800 --> 38:21.717
Of course. Oh...

38:23.803 --> 38:24.804
Thanks, bro.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.517
Since you
so rudely failed to answer,

38:29.725 --> 38:32.561
I was forced to purchase
all the bagel varieties.

38:48.160 --> 38:51.580
EpiPen, EpiPen, EpiPen.

38:56.002 --> 38:58.629
Liv. Come on.
Wake up. Come on.

38:58.838 --> 39:00.214
Liv...

39:00.423 --> 39:02.967
What happened?
Who was that? Can you speak?

39:03.175 --> 39:04.552
No!

39:54.226 --> 39:55.186
What?

39:56.270 --> 39:57.313
Where's Janko?

39:59.607 --> 40:02.193
We were fighting
for the tranquilizer gun,

40:02.401 --> 40:06.197
and we rolled around
and it went off, and...

40:08.240 --> 40:11.994
He had it set for a massive
overdose. I didn't know,

40:12.203 --> 40:13.704
I didn't mean to, you know...

40:14.914 --> 40:16.207
Murder him.

40:16.415 --> 40:17.875
You didn't murder anyone.

40:19.668 --> 40:20.920
I put him in the drawer.

40:21.128 --> 40:22.380
I figured I'd wait
until you woke up

40:22.588 --> 40:25.466
before I called
Clive to take me away.

40:25.674 --> 40:27.051
It was self-defense.

40:28.636 --> 40:30.429
You saved both of our lives.

40:32.723 --> 40:34.767
Maybe we don't report it.

40:34.975 --> 40:36.435
And we, uh...

40:36.644 --> 40:39.563
We, we smuggle the body out,
and dump it in the bay.

40:39.772 --> 40:43.275
Is that what you do?
Dump it in the bay by
the cover of darkness?

40:43.484 --> 40:44.443
Wait. No...

40:44.652 --> 40:45.778
Right.

40:45.986 --> 40:47.780
I'll just
turn myself in.

40:47.988 --> 40:49.198
I mean, no.

40:49.407 --> 40:50.324
We keep him.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.285
He's valuable.

40:53.494 --> 40:55.621
He knows what's going on
in the basement at Max Rager.

40:55.788 --> 40:57.415
He knows
what happened to Drake.

40:57.623 --> 40:58.541
We need him.

40:59.542 --> 41:00.876
Well, not all of him.

41:14.598 --> 41:15.766
The sesame one was mine.

41:19.145 --> 41:20.354
<i>Billy Don't Be a Hero?</i>

41:20.563 --> 41:23.149
C'mon.
<i>50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.</i>

41:23.357 --> 41:24.442
I'm loving this brain.

41:24.650 --> 41:25.860
I'm going to stay
on this forever.

41:26.068 --> 41:29.029
Okay, uh,
all right, how about this?

41:33.159 --> 41:34.243
Help!

41:34.452 --> 41:35.661
Let us out!

41:35.828 --> 41:37.955
Oh, I'd say they've
thawed right out, Janko.

41:38.164 --> 41:39.832
Downright lively.
Wouldn't you say?

41:40.040 --> 41:41.500
Let us out!

41:47.840 --> 41:48.841
He's alive!

41:49.049 --> 41:49.967
Drake's alive.

41:51.343 --> 41:52.511
I just saw your zombies.

41:53.929 --> 41:55.014
They're all alive!
