WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:08.965
It's happening again.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.359
Rosa, Rosa, Hitchcock fell
asleep in the break room.

00:11.402 --> 00:12.925
I pranked him.
I tied his shoelaces together.

00:12.969 --> 00:14.275
- You're 38 years old,
dude.

00:14.318 --> 00:16.103
- I know, and yet my pranks
still stay so fresh.

00:16.146 --> 00:17.408
It's incredible.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.149
- You gotta untie his shoes
before he gets hurt.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.846
- Look, seriously?

00:20.890 --> 00:22.848
- Seriously.
-  Fine.

00:22.892 --> 00:24.676
But what's the worst thing
that could happen?

00:25.677 --> 00:26.809
- He's being strangled
to death!

00:26.852 --> 00:27.853
- How?

00:53.140 --> 00:55.968
- So you still annoyed?
- Yes.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.666
You can't keep saying
"mischief managed"

00:57.709 --> 00:59.102
after we finish sex.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.364
It's what Harry Potter says

01:00.408 --> 01:01.583
when he needs to clear
the Marauder's Map.

01:01.626 --> 01:04.064
- Obviously, I know that,
but I would prefer

01:04.107 --> 01:06.196
to keep wizard terms
out of our sex life.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.589
- But what we're doing
is magical.

01:07.632 --> 01:08.590
We're making a baby.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.288
- Wait, why'd you stop
the elevator?

01:11.332 --> 01:15.075
- Look, I know you're excited,
and I am too,

01:15.118 --> 01:16.424
but I really don't
want to talk

01:16.467 --> 01:18.556
about us trying to get pregnant
while we're at work.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.428
You haven't said anything
to Charles, right?

01:20.471 --> 01:22.169
- No, and it's killing me.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.127
I still don't get why you can
tell Rosa but I can't tell him.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.389
- Rosa's low key.

01:25.433 --> 01:26.477
- Charles can be low key.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.000
- So how was
everyone's weekend?

01:28.044 --> 01:29.393
- Oh, uh,
we bought a couch.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.526
- Hoo-hoo,
tell me everything!

01:31.569 --> 01:34.137
- Okay, fine,
he can be a bit much.

01:34.181 --> 01:35.704
But don't worry.

01:35.747 --> 01:37.836
I have a plan that guarantees
I'm not gonna tell him.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.534
I've cut him out of my life
completely.

01:39.577 --> 01:40.665
- That doesn't
seem sustainable.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.841
- Yeah, well, so far,
it's working

01:42.885 --> 01:44.191
and it's foolproof,
so--

01:44.234 --> 01:45.409
- Morning!

01:45.453 --> 01:46.628
Jake, can I talk to you
for a second?

01:46.671 --> 01:47.846
- Mm-hmm.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.239
- I feel like we haven't
hung out in forever.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.588
- Oh, is that so? I didn't
realize. Is that the case?

01:50.632 --> 01:52.068
- You wanna get a drink
after work tonight?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.983
I'm dying to tell you
about Genevieve's new shampoo.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.027
It's edible.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.377
- Oh, wow,
that sounds so fun,

01:56.420 --> 01:59.728
but I actually...can't
because I have plans

01:59.771 --> 02:01.991
with Ron Weasley...berg.
It's a friend of Amy's.

02:02.034 --> 02:04.559
The point is, I'm unavailable
for a very real reason.

02:04.602 --> 02:05.647
- Jake!

02:05.690 --> 02:06.865
- Oh, my God, is that...
- Boyle!

02:06.909 --> 02:08.040
- It does sound like...

02:08.084 --> 02:10.260
It's me, Adrian Pimento.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.392
- Yeah, we know.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.610
Hi, Adrian.
How are you?

02:12.654 --> 02:15.265
- Very bad, someone's
trying to kill me.

02:15.309 --> 02:17.006
- Before we wrap up
this briefing,

02:17.049 --> 02:19.139
I wanted to give
a few shout-outs.

02:19.182 --> 02:21.228
Diaz, great job on that B&E.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.926
You are a good cop
with a great attitude.

02:23.969 --> 02:25.971
- I don't like this.
- Santiago, when I think

02:26.015 --> 02:29.671
of your CompStat reports,
one word comes to mind: wow.

02:29.714 --> 02:32.500
And that "WOW" is an acronym
for "wow, oh, wow."

02:32.543 --> 02:33.936
- What is happening?
- He's buttering us up

02:33.979 --> 02:36.417
before giving us some
devastatingly bad news.

02:36.460 --> 02:37.940
My God, Jake and Charles
are dead.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.508
- Jake and Charles
are not dead.

02:40.551 --> 02:41.726
It's worse than that.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.467
We have to do
our annual HR seminar

02:43.511 --> 02:44.990
on workplace conflict
tomorrow.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.166
- What? Already?

02:46.209 --> 02:47.950
- I know.
I know.

02:47.993 --> 02:50.300
These seminars are not exactly
our favorite things.

02:50.344 --> 02:51.432
- Question:
if I get shot

02:51.475 --> 02:52.911
in the line of duty,
can I miss it?

02:52.955 --> 02:54.043
- Legally, you still
have to make it up.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.392
- Well, there goes
that plan.

02:55.436 --> 02:58.003
- Sir, it's a seminar
that's too boring for me.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.092
I'm saying no to a seminar.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.920
- Look, it's mandatory,
it's not up for debate,

03:01.964 --> 03:03.226
but we'll get through it

03:03.270 --> 03:05.185
'cause we're the best squad
in the city

03:05.228 --> 03:07.709
with the nicest hair,
the kindest eyes.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.885
- He's buttering us up again,
so more bad news is coming.

03:10.886 --> 03:12.453
- HR said they're
sending a funny guy.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.498
- No!

03:14.542 --> 03:17.501
- All I know is, I woke up
in a pool of my own blood

03:17.545 --> 03:19.982
next to a metal chair
that had a dent in it

03:20.025 --> 03:22.332
the same shape as my head.

03:22.376 --> 03:23.551
- What were you doing
before the attack?

03:23.594 --> 03:25.379
- I was sitting in said
metal chair watching

03:25.422 --> 03:27.729
the season two premiere
of "The Masked Singer."

03:27.772 --> 03:28.817
The Egg had just gone,

03:28.860 --> 03:30.688
and I'm pretty sure
I know who it is,

03:30.732 --> 03:31.689
Sara Gilbert.

03:31.733 --> 03:32.777
- That doesn't
make any sense.

03:32.821 --> 03:33.909
- Are you kidding?

03:33.952 --> 03:35.389
You don't think I know
how Darlene walks?

03:35.432 --> 03:36.868
- No, no, no, no,
I'm sure you do,

03:36.912 --> 03:39.436
it's just "The Masked Singer"
ended four months ago.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.046
I still can't believe
that the Bowl of Ramen

03:41.090 --> 03:42.134
wasn't Dikembe Mutombo.

03:42.178 --> 03:43.135
- Four month--
no, no, no.

03:43.179 --> 03:44.702
I watched this last night.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.661
That doesn't make any--

03:46.704 --> 03:48.489
Where am I?

03:48.532 --> 03:50.491
What is that table?
- Calm down.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.928
You're at the nine-nine,
and you know what a table is.

03:52.971 --> 03:54.451
- I don't remember coming here.
How did I get here?

03:54.495 --> 03:56.410
- Oh, my God.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.281
Pimento has
"Memento" disease.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.804
Your memory
is resetting

03:59.848 --> 04:02.329
like the guy from
the movie "Memento."

04:02.372 --> 04:03.721
- What?
- You guys never saw "Memento"?

04:03.765 --> 04:05.549
It's the guy with
no short-term memory,

04:05.593 --> 04:07.203
you know, Christopher Nolan's
first movie.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.900
- Is it like Dory
from "Finding Dory,"

04:08.944 --> 04:10.250
she keeps forgetting
where she's swimming?

04:10.293 --> 04:12.513
- No, no, it's like--
- Dory, yeah, yeah, yeah!

04:12.556 --> 04:14.384
I'm like the forgetful
little fish.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.994
- Ah.
- Oh, I mean, yeah, it's like

04:16.038 --> 04:17.605
that, but it's also like--
- Just keep swimming!

04:17.648 --> 04:19.433
- That's what Dory says.
- Classic Dory, Jake!

04:19.476 --> 04:20.738
- Ugh, you guys
really ruined

04:20.782 --> 04:22.305
the coolness of this
"Memento" thing.

04:22.349 --> 04:23.741
- Also, Jake, "Following"

04:23.785 --> 04:25.308
is Christopher Nolan's
first movie.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.441
You sound like a grade A
out here.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.878
- What's up, squad?

04:29.921 --> 04:32.750
Hope y'all like condiments
because I got all the sauce.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.012
- Huh?

04:34.056 --> 04:35.623
- I arrested a tween shoplifter
yesterday,

04:35.666 --> 04:38.016
and she was real cool
at talking.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.932
- I love you, Amy, but maybe
slang isn't your thing.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.630
Whatevs.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.371
Check it: I got a copy

04:44.414 --> 04:46.634
of last year's workplace
conflict presentation.

04:46.677 --> 04:49.680
All we have to do
is study the crap out of it,

04:49.724 --> 04:51.334
then we can answer
every question

04:51.378 --> 04:53.989
before that tool from HR
even asks it.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.599
We'll be done in no time.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.601
- So your solution for getting
us out of the boring seminar

04:57.645 --> 04:59.777
is having us memorize
the boring seminar.

04:59.821 --> 05:00.735
- Exactly.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.606
- It's genius,
and it's fun.

05:02.650 --> 05:03.868
I love committing things
to memory.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.479
- Yeah, I'm out.
I don't do homework.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.089
- You do now.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.787
Get busy, ya flope.
- Flope?

05:09.831 --> 05:11.963
- It means loser, okay?
It's new slang.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.357
People are saying it!
The tween said so!

05:14.401 --> 05:15.837
- It just doesn't
make any sense.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.317
I mean, you love
"The Dark Knight,"

05:17.360 --> 05:18.492
you love "Inception,"

05:18.535 --> 05:20.232
and you haven't even
seen"Memento"?

05:20.276 --> 05:21.625
- Jake, I don't know
what to tell ya.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.105
I spend a lot of time
in jungles, you know.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.802
They don't exactly
get movies like that.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.022
It's usually big blockbusters
like "Finding Dory."

05:27.065 --> 05:28.632
- 486 million domestic.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.982
- When you factor in
international, 1.2 billion.

05:31.026 --> 05:33.420
- Look, Adrian, we don't
have a ton to go off on here.

05:33.463 --> 05:34.595
What else has been
going on in your life?

05:34.638 --> 05:35.639
- Normal stuff.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.162
Ooh, I got hired as a PI

05:37.206 --> 05:38.947
by the Countess Luann
from "Real Housewives."

05:38.990 --> 05:41.863
I ended up sleeping with her
in a tiny hotel Jacuzzi.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.647
I also microwaved
a watermelon

05:43.691 --> 05:44.822
just to see if
it would explode.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.476
- Okay, this is
immediately unhelpful,

05:46.520 --> 05:49.218
but did
the watermelon explode?

05:49.261 --> 05:50.785
- It just cracked
and got hot.

05:50.828 --> 05:52.482
- Oh.
- Total bust.

05:52.526 --> 05:53.483
- Hey, maybe
one of your PI cases

05:53.527 --> 05:54.658
is the reason
you got attacked.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.486
- I thought of that too,
but I doubt it.

05:56.530 --> 05:58.836
You know, they're all the same,
kinda boring.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.362
It's some redheaded lady wants
me to hack her husband's phone

06:02.405 --> 06:05.452
to see if he's cheating with
a spin instructor named Kendra.

06:05.495 --> 06:06.670
- It seems a little specific

06:06.714 --> 06:08.106
that they would all
be like that, but okay.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.500
- Where is that
coming from?

06:10.544 --> 06:11.980
- Oh, my God,
there's a bomb in my chest!

06:12.023 --> 06:13.634
- What?
- They put a bomb in my chest!

06:13.677 --> 06:15.070
- What do we do?

06:17.681 --> 06:19.422
Wait a second, the sound's
coming from my little watch.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.425
- You just assumed
there was a bomb inside you?

06:22.469 --> 06:26.603
- It says, "Take pill,
right jacket po"--

06:26.647 --> 06:29.563
I've never seen these
before in my life.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.260
- This was filled
three days ago.

06:31.303 --> 06:34.263
This doctor must be
treating you for your...

06:34.306 --> 06:36.047
- "Finding Dory" Disease,

06:36.091 --> 06:38.223
that's what most people call
anterograde amnesia.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.573
both: Just keep swimming.

06:39.616 --> 06:41.444
- Exactly, that's what
I tell my patients,

06:41.488 --> 06:42.880
just keep swimming.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.708
- So what do you think
caused Pimento's memory loss?

06:44.752 --> 06:46.710
- Probably years
of repeated head trauma.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.451
I've been working
as a neurologist

06:48.495 --> 06:51.846
for over two decades,
and I have neverseen a patient

06:51.889 --> 06:53.630
with more traumatic
head injuries.

06:53.674 --> 06:54.805
- Well, doesn't look so bad.

06:54.849 --> 06:56.241
- The red
is the good parts.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.417
- Oh, my God.

06:57.460 --> 06:58.461
Oh, I guess
it does make sense.

06:58.505 --> 06:59.680
Pimento lives pretty hard.

06:59.723 --> 07:00.942
- I locked my keys
in the car again.

07:00.985 --> 07:02.596
I guess I'll have
to smash the window.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.119
- Actually, I got
a hammer in my car.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.339
Come on,
everybody knows

07:07.383 --> 07:09.080
the skull is the hammer
of the body.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.430
- Yeah, that's not true.

07:10.473 --> 07:11.605
- What? Really?

07:11.648 --> 07:13.781
Okay, well,
then this is on me.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.609
- Look, this morning,
Pimento was screaming

07:15.652 --> 07:16.914
about someone
trying to kill him.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.263
Has he said anything
like that to you?

07:18.307 --> 07:20.527
- He has, but I've seen him
every day for weeks,

07:20.570 --> 07:22.050
and I haven't noticed
any new injuries,

07:22.093 --> 07:25.401
but the medication he's on
may be making him paranoid.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.663
- Really? Because he doesn't--

07:26.707 --> 07:28.578
There's a bomb in my chest!

07:29.797 --> 07:31.538
- Right, he does keep
doing that.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.018
- Hey, it was nice of you

07:34.062 --> 07:35.280
to let Pimento crash
at your place last night.

07:35.324 --> 07:36.281
How'd it go?

07:36.325 --> 07:37.326
- Oh, well, he gave Nikolaj

07:37.369 --> 07:38.719
a haircut
while he was asleep,

07:38.762 --> 07:41.199
but no weird memory stuff,
so all in all, major win.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.984
- Great, so it sounds like
he might be getting better.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.768
- Ah, someone's
trying to kill me!

07:44.812 --> 07:45.943
- Oh, boy,
here we go again.

07:45.987 --> 07:48.598
- Ah, gah!
- Pimento, Pimento, Pimento!

07:48.642 --> 07:50.339
Don't worry.
Everything's okay.

07:50.382 --> 07:51.514
You've had
some brain trauma,

07:51.558 --> 07:52.776
and it caused you
to lose your memory.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.430
You're scared
that you're in danger,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.737
but there is no evidence that
anyone is trying to kill you.

07:56.780 --> 07:58.129
You're safe.
- Wait, wait, really?

07:58.173 --> 08:00.131
Whew, okay.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.742
Thank you.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.134
I was really worried, you know,
'cause of this gunshot wound.

08:03.178 --> 08:04.962
- Oh, my God, someone's
trying to kill you!

08:05.006 --> 08:07.530
- What? You just told me
that wasn't the case!

08:09.750 --> 08:11.360
- So there I am, naked,

08:11.403 --> 08:12.535
still holding
the hedge trimmers

08:12.579 --> 08:14.798
when the chauffeur walks in
and I say,

08:14.842 --> 08:16.321
"Guess you caught me
red-handed."

08:16.365 --> 08:17.932
- Because of the blood?
- Yeah, because of the blood!

08:17.975 --> 08:18.933
See, you get it.

08:20.456 --> 08:21.936
- The bullet went through
your friend's shoulder.

08:21.979 --> 08:24.460
He should be fine,
although he does keep asking me

08:24.504 --> 08:25.983
if we do the "Face/Off"
surgery here.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.768
And what'd you tell him?

08:27.811 --> 08:29.160
- That we don't.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.510
Right.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.338
She's hiding something.
- Obviously.

08:33.382 --> 08:35.776
Okay, Adrian, there's very
little evidence to go on,

08:35.819 --> 08:37.865
so we should take a look
at your PI case files.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.257
- Don't have any.

08:39.301 --> 08:41.216
Keep everything right up here
in the old steel--

08:41.259 --> 08:42.260
where am I?

08:42.304 --> 08:43.479
What is this bed?

08:43.523 --> 08:44.785
- And his memory's
resetting.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.003
All right, Adrian,
someone's trying to kill you.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.439
- Uh-huh.
- You have a memory disorder...

08:47.483 --> 08:49.354
- That makes sense.
- Like in the movie "Memento."

08:49.398 --> 08:51.356
- I haven't seen that!
- It's like "Finding Dory."

08:51.400 --> 08:52.880
- Oh, now I know
exactly what's going on.

08:52.923 --> 08:53.924
Thank you, Charles.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.186
- Okay, let's get you dressed

08:55.230 --> 08:56.492
and back to the precinct
where it's safe.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.841
- Okay.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.364
- Oh, Adrian, the back
of your gown's open.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.149
- Don't peek at my tushy.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.717
- Ah. Wait, since when is
your back covered in tattoos?

09:03.760 --> 09:05.153
- It's not,

09:05.196 --> 09:07.198
otherwise I couldn't get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.809
- Are you Jewish?
- Not yet.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.854
Ooh, I should ask that nurse if
they've got a mohel on staff.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.421
- Wait, maybe you've been
getting tattoos

09:12.464 --> 09:14.075
to help you remember things,
like the guy in "Memento."

09:14.118 --> 09:15.424
- Again, haven't seen it.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.165
- No, the tattoos
could be clues

09:17.208 --> 09:18.166
that you're leaving
for yourself.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.602
Here, we'll step out.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.212
You get undressed and write
down everything you see,

09:21.256 --> 09:23.388
and you're fully naked.
- Hey-oh!

09:23.432 --> 09:25.173
- All right, well, I guess
we're looking at 'em together.

09:26.261 --> 09:27.784
- My name is Brad Portenberg,

09:27.828 --> 09:31.571
and today I'm gonna teach you
about workplace conflict.

09:31.614 --> 09:35.052
So I brought along someone
who's an expert in conflict:

09:35.096 --> 09:36.445
my ex-wife.

09:38.186 --> 09:39.317
Just kidding.

09:39.361 --> 09:40.623
She lives in Vermont
with our kids.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.321
So can anyone tell me
what a stereotype is?

09:43.365 --> 09:45.062
- The Irish are
potato-eating drunks.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.455
- And the gays--
- No, no, no,

09:46.498 --> 09:48.675
what does the word
"stereotype" mean?

09:48.718 --> 09:50.372
- Uh...
- I got this, fellas.

09:50.415 --> 09:52.069
It's a preconceived,
often prejudiced notion

09:52.113 --> 09:53.680
about a group of people.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.595
- Great, and can anyone tell me
what a protected class is?

09:55.638 --> 09:57.553
- A group of people
with a common characteristic

09:57.597 --> 09:59.599
that is legally protected
from employment discrimination.

09:59.642 --> 10:00.774
- And how many protected
classes are there?

10:00.817 --> 10:01.775
- 20.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.167
- Wow.

10:03.211 --> 10:05.082
It seems like
I have myself a star pupil.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.736
- Honey, you have no idea.

10:06.780 --> 10:09.086
- "Extra ranch, no tomato,
no cilantro."

10:09.130 --> 10:10.610
These are just a list
of modifications

10:10.653 --> 10:12.176
on a signature salad
from Panera.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.831
- Okay, this one says,
"Buy toilet paper"

10:14.875 --> 10:17.181
in a truly gigantic font.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.574
I hate to think
of the horrific event

10:18.618 --> 10:20.358
that led to a reminder
of this size.

10:20.402 --> 10:23.927
- This says your bank account
number is 432211378,

10:23.971 --> 10:25.233
then just under that,

10:25.276 --> 10:26.887
"Someone saw this
and stole your money."

10:26.930 --> 10:28.279
- Aw.
- Ew.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.107
This just says,
"Don't trust your D."

10:30.151 --> 10:31.979
- Okay, well,
that's good advice.

10:32.022 --> 10:33.502
My D does get me
in a lot of trouble.

10:33.545 --> 10:35.286
- Are you sure that's what
the D stands for?

10:35.330 --> 10:36.766
- Oh, it's for sure my dong.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.813
It could tell some stories:
Costa Rica in '98, Nam.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.336
- It's coming up.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.946
- Oh, no, there's a bomb
in my chest!

10:42.990 --> 10:44.382
Save yourselves!

10:44.426 --> 10:45.949
- No, no, no, no, it's just
your little watch, okay?

10:45.993 --> 10:47.385
Means it's time for you
to take your pills.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.822
You keep them in
your right coat pocket.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.172
- Oh, okay.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.477
Where's my coat?
- It's down in my car.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.131
- Ah, I'll go get it.
You stay here.

10:54.175 --> 10:55.306
- No, no, no,
your penis is out.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.308
I'll go.
- Okay.

10:57.352 --> 11:00.181
Whew, boy, I love
that little guy, right?

11:00.224 --> 11:01.312
- Yeah.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.880
Oh, my phone's ringing.
Gotta grab it.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.142
It's Amy.
- Aw, Ames!

11:05.186 --> 11:06.187
Put her on FaceTime.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.797
- Wha?
No.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.886
- Come on!
- Hey, what's going on?

11:09.930 --> 11:11.540
- Hey, just checking in.

11:11.583 --> 11:13.150
How's it going with Charles?

11:13.194 --> 11:14.891
I know how hard
this is for you.

11:14.935 --> 11:15.979
Have you told him anything?

11:16.023 --> 11:17.154
- Nope, we're still all good.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.634
He has no idea that we are

11:18.678 --> 11:20.549
growing a Whomping Willow
in your Chamber of Secrets.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.507
- Well, I have to get back
to the seminar.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.248
Also, you've
ruined sex forever.

11:24.292 --> 11:25.293
- Yep, I heard it.

11:25.336 --> 11:26.294
I don't know why
I keep doing it.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.078
I love you. Bye.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.210
- What was all that about?

11:29.253 --> 11:30.951
- Oh, I actually
really can't tell you.

11:30.994 --> 11:32.517
No, wait a minute,
you're the only person

11:32.561 --> 11:33.823
that I can tell because
your brain's broken.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.216
Anything I say,
you'll just forget.

11:35.259 --> 11:36.739
- Well, I guess that's true.
Give it to me.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.132
- Amy and I are trying
to have a baby.

11:38.175 --> 11:41.135
- What?
Jake, that's wonderful.

11:41.178 --> 11:42.527
Come on, bring it in.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.181
- I'd rather not,
but it still feels really nice

11:44.225 --> 11:45.530
to talk to someone
about it finally.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.532
But I'm gonna be a dad.
It's so crazy.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.186
Hey, don't mention this
around Charles.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.188
Where am I?

11:51.232 --> 11:52.537
- Oh, perfect.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.844
- Listen, Denise,
I felt personally attacked

11:54.888 --> 11:57.151
when you included sesame bagels
at the bagel brunch

11:57.194 --> 11:58.543
knowing full well
I'm allergic.

11:58.587 --> 11:59.762
I developed a rash.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.807
- Says you, Ainsley.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.809
I believe food allergies
are a hoax.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.768
Perhaps your rash is from
all that makeup you wear.

12:05.812 --> 12:09.424
This is an office,
not some downtown dancery.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.860
- Okay, great.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.384
Now, in this roleplay, who can
tell me what went wrong?

12:13.428 --> 12:15.169
- Denise should have made
reasonable accommodations

12:15.212 --> 12:16.561
given Ainsley's
medical issue.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.476
Ainsley unnecessarily
heightened the conflict

12:18.520 --> 12:20.435
by assuming that Denise
had a personal vendetta,

12:20.478 --> 12:21.741
and Denise shouldn't
have responded

12:21.784 --> 12:23.612
to Ainsley's complaint
with an ad hominem attack.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.135
- My thoughts exactly.
- I concur.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.094
- Yep.
- Wow.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.965
I'm really disappointed...

12:29.009 --> 12:31.185
that I have nothing
to correct you on.

12:31.228 --> 12:32.664
That was amazing.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.362
I have never had a group finish

12:34.405 --> 12:36.494
this entire seminar
that quickly before.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.801
It reminds me of
a really funny joke about--

12:38.845 --> 12:40.063
- Ha, ha, I'm laughing already.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.935
Great seminar, sad it's over,

12:41.978 --> 12:43.197
but it is, so see ya.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.807
- Actually,
I have good news.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.678
State law requires
that this seminar

12:46.722 --> 12:48.289
be no less than six hours,

12:48.332 --> 12:50.247
so I guess we'll spend
the next two hours

12:50.291 --> 12:51.901
diving into specific conflicts

12:51.945 --> 12:54.121
about this workplace
and solving them.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.644
- But we beat you.

12:55.687 --> 12:56.906
We beat you with study.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.734
- Brad, my funny friend,

12:58.778 --> 13:00.214
we don't need
this training.

13:00.257 --> 13:01.911
We don't have
any workplace conflicts.

13:01.955 --> 13:05.175
- Oh, there's always
conflict somewhere.

13:05.219 --> 13:08.918
Now, it could be something
small, like a pet peeve, or--

13:08.962 --> 13:11.616
- Hitchcock slept with my wife,
Kelly, in 1988!

13:11.660 --> 13:16.186
- So Kelly was his wife,
not his dog.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.710
- Hey, before Charles
gets back,

13:18.754 --> 13:20.234
there's a few more secrets I
want to say out loud to someone

13:20.277 --> 13:21.278
who will immediately
forget them.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.627
- Give 'em to me.
- In 11th grade,

13:22.671 --> 13:24.629
I told everyone I was
going to a Megadeth concert,

13:24.673 --> 13:26.588
but it was actually Melissa
Etheridge, and I loved it.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.503
Also, one time,
I ate a dog biscuit

13:28.546 --> 13:29.634
just to see
what it tasted like.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.114
- I get it.
They're delicious.

13:31.158 --> 13:32.289
- They're not bad.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.551
- Oh, here comes Charles.

13:33.595 --> 13:34.944
- Hey, man, did you get
Pimento's meds?

13:34.988 --> 13:36.641
- Sure did.
- Aw, thanks, Chuck.

13:36.685 --> 13:39.819
See, this is gonna make me
feel a lot better.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.951
- I grabbed you a water from
the hospital to wash 'em down.

13:41.995 --> 13:43.605
- Aw, thanks, Jake.

13:43.648 --> 13:44.911
You're gonna
make a good dad.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.304
I'm so glad you and Amy
are taking that step.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.784
- What? How did you--

13:48.828 --> 13:50.830
what about
your memory reset?

13:50.873 --> 13:52.570
- You and Amy
are trying to have a baby

13:52.614 --> 13:54.094
and you told Pimento
and not me?

13:55.225 --> 13:56.923
- They've got
a Panera here?

13:56.966 --> 14:00.404
Okay, I love their salads
exactly as they come.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.579
- Actually, you don't.

14:01.623 --> 14:02.711
Thanks, Jakey.

14:02.754 --> 14:05.235
See, you're gonna
make a great dad.

14:05.279 --> 14:06.715
- Stop saying that!

14:09.022 --> 14:10.414
- Hey.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.763
So you wanna talk about
what happened before?

14:11.807 --> 14:12.895
- You mean the "you telling
Pimento and not me

14:12.939 --> 14:14.288
that you're trying
to make a baby" thing?

14:14.331 --> 14:17.073
No, no, I'm totally fine.

14:17.117 --> 14:20.424
Hey, coffee guy, how would you
like be godfather to my son?

14:20.468 --> 14:22.122
Because a position
just opened up.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.819
- Okay, we're talking
about this.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.126
Look, you're being unfair.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.301
There's some things
in my life with Amy

14:27.344 --> 14:28.345
that are just between
her and me,

14:28.389 --> 14:29.651
and I need you
to be okay with that.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.348
- Fine.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.220
You're right.
I get it.

14:33.263 --> 14:34.830
I mean, it's not like
you told anyone else.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.919
- Right.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.574
I mean...

14:39.617 --> 14:40.662
- We told Rosa.

14:40.705 --> 14:42.185
- Rosa, that dud?

14:42.229 --> 14:43.360
Oh, why her and not me?

14:43.404 --> 14:45.014
- Sometimes you can
be a little much.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.451
- A little much?
A little much!

14:47.495 --> 14:49.105
- Yes, a little much.

14:49.149 --> 14:51.716
- Well, maybe, Jake, I have
"Finding Dory" Disease too

14:51.760 --> 14:53.022
because right now,

14:53.066 --> 14:55.198
I can't remember
why we ever were friends!

14:55.242 --> 14:57.374
- Okay, see, once again,
that was a little over the top.

14:57.418 --> 15:01.509
- Excuse me, my godson's dad,
the crazy guy just ran away.

15:01.552 --> 15:02.945
- Oh, my God, he's gone.

15:02.989 --> 15:04.773
Pimento is gone.
- Just like our friendship!

15:04.816 --> 15:05.861
- Come on, Charles.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.384
- Well, I've got
a bean to boil too.

15:07.428 --> 15:10.648
Santiago always tries
to finish my sentences

15:10.692 --> 15:11.998
and frequently gets it wrong.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.043
- I do not,
and I am not wrong.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.350
- You do it all the--
- Time?

15:16.393 --> 15:19.135
- No, I was going to say,
"All the day long."

15:19.179 --> 15:20.615
See? Frequently wrong.

15:20.658 --> 15:23.879
- I dogsat for Scully,
and he never thanked me.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.967
Kelly was a real handful.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.360
- Wait, I'm confused again.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.449
Kelly was a dog?
- There were two Kellys.

15:28.492 --> 15:31.017
You'd know that if you'd
ever listened to my podcast.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.148
- Okay, dude, just relax.

15:32.192 --> 15:33.628
- Don't tell us to relax

15:33.671 --> 15:35.543
just because you're too nice
to have any pet peeves.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.240
- Oh, Terry's got peeves.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.460
Terry hates the way you always
make mouth noises when you eat.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.723
Nom, nom, I'm Rosa.
I'm eating a croissant.

15:41.766 --> 15:42.985
Nom, nom.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.595
- How's this for a mouth noise?
You suck.

15:44.639 --> 15:45.683
- No, you suck!

15:45.727 --> 15:47.381
- As do you, as do you and you!

15:47.424 --> 15:49.644
- Oh, yeah? Well,
you're all a bunch of flopes.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.124
- Flopes?
- This is the flope right here.

15:54.475 --> 15:55.519
- Okay, all right.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.566
Okay, guys,
that is our six hours.

15:58.609 --> 16:00.263
The seminar is over.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.091
I'm really proud of you guys,

16:02.135 --> 16:04.006
lots of good progress
here today.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.399
You're welcome.

16:05.442 --> 16:08.054
- I'm Detective Boyle.
This is my partner, Jake.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.185
You probably think it's weird

16:09.229 --> 16:10.578
that I said partner
and not friend.

16:10.621 --> 16:11.927
- Not at all.
- Well, the point is

16:11.971 --> 16:13.755
that we're strictly
colleagues.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.235
Have you seen this man?

16:15.278 --> 16:17.585
- Yeah, he was here a few
hours ago for a new tattoo.

16:17.628 --> 16:18.716
It was supposed to say,

16:18.760 --> 16:19.717
"Jake and Amy are trying
to have a baby."

16:19.761 --> 16:21.415
- Seriously?
- Aw.

16:21.458 --> 16:22.807
Wait a minute, what do you mean
"supposed to"?

16:22.851 --> 16:24.113
- He jumped out of the chair
before I could finish,

16:24.157 --> 16:25.593
second time
it's happened.

16:25.636 --> 16:26.724
First time, he left
with a tat that said,

16:26.768 --> 16:27.899
"Don't trust your D."

16:27.943 --> 16:29.336
- That wasn't the whole tattoo?
- No.

16:29.379 --> 16:30.772
He wanted it to say,
"Don't trust your doctor."

16:30.815 --> 16:32.339
- Oh, my God.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.950
Pimento's doctor
is trying to kill him.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.386
He must have remembered
something

16:36.430 --> 16:37.605
when he stopped
taking his pills.

16:37.648 --> 16:38.867
The pills are what's messing
with his memory.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.347
- We have to find him
before his doctor does.

16:40.390 --> 16:41.957
- Oh, I know where he's going.
- You do? Where?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.045
- Said he's going
to his doctor.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.438
- Oh.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.180
Thanks.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.270
- Detectives,
good to see you again.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.141
- Oh, I see, the villain
playing it cool

16:52.185 --> 16:53.751
when confronted
by the good guys,

16:53.795 --> 16:56.145
just like Javier Bardem
in "No Country for Old Men."

16:58.147 --> 16:59.844
Do you guys only watch
kids' movies?

16:59.888 --> 17:03.544
- Whatever you're insinuating,
I assure you, you're incorrect.

17:03.587 --> 17:04.936
- Cut the crap, Doc.
We know everything.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.200
- That's right,
your wife hired Pimento as a PI

17:07.243 --> 17:08.766
to find out if you
were cheating on her

17:08.810 --> 17:11.073
with your spin class
instructor, Kendra.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.379
- And you were,

17:12.422 --> 17:14.163
so you silenced Pimento
before he could tell her

17:14.207 --> 17:15.643
by drugging
him to ruin his memory.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.340
Now where is he?
- I haven't see him.

17:17.384 --> 17:19.299
- Oh, please, you're making
this way too easy.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.735
You clearly just glanced
at this door.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.084
- Don't.
He's not in there.

17:22.128 --> 17:24.086
- Oh, really? Because I'm
pretty sure that he...

17:24.130 --> 17:25.218
isn't.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.175
But he clearly was.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.134
- Jake, help!

17:28.177 --> 17:29.570
- Pimento.

17:33.052 --> 17:33.965
- Got him.

17:34.009 --> 17:35.097
Help!

17:35.141 --> 17:36.185
Jake, what's happening?

17:36.229 --> 17:37.447
What is this ledge?

17:37.491 --> 17:39.145
- You must have tried
to escape out the window

17:39.188 --> 17:40.624
and then your
memory reset.

17:40.668 --> 17:41.930
- What?
I don't understand.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.279
Why would
my memory reset?

17:43.323 --> 17:46.978
- It's just like the film...

17:47.022 --> 17:48.154
"Finding Dory."

17:48.197 --> 17:50.286
- Huh?
- "Finding Dory."

17:50.330 --> 17:51.287
- Ah, say no more!

17:51.331 --> 17:53.115
I completely understand!

17:53.159 --> 17:54.682
- Just stay where you are.
I'm gonna come get you.

17:54.725 --> 17:55.987
- Okay.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.293
Should I go over here?

17:57.337 --> 17:58.599
- No, why would you
go over there?

17:58.642 --> 17:59.774
- I don't know!

17:59.817 --> 18:01.515
I just woke up out here!

18:01.558 --> 18:02.516
- Just stay still!

18:02.559 --> 18:04.170
- Ah, I don't know
what to do!

18:04.213 --> 18:06.520
- Okay, all right.
Here I come.

18:06.563 --> 18:07.564
Here I come.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.088
- Uh, I'm scared
of heights, Jake.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.220
- Yeah, so am I, Adrian.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.656
- This might not be
the time to tell you,

18:12.700 --> 18:15.616
but both my parents died
falling out of lighthouses,

18:15.659 --> 18:16.660
separate incidents.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.053
- Oh, man, I have
so many questions,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.011
but for now,
just follow my lead, okay?

18:20.055 --> 18:21.056
- Okay.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.144
- Take small
little baby steps,

18:22.188 --> 18:23.232
like this.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.105
- You're not moving!

18:26.148 --> 18:27.715
- I'm not?

18:27.758 --> 18:29.760
Oh, uh-oh.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.852
- Huh, I'm really
scared, Jake.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.245
I'm really scared.
- Yeah, I know,

18:36.289 --> 18:38.856
just try and look at one thing
and focus only on that

18:38.900 --> 18:40.380
until I can get Charles
out here to help.

18:40.423 --> 18:41.816
- Okay, okay.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.992
Ooh, there's a juicy
old person butt in that window.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.037
- Why's it gotta be
juicy and old?

18:46.081 --> 18:48.301
- I don't know,
but I'm grateful for it.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.780
- All right,
just lock in on that.

18:49.824 --> 18:51.913
Hey, Charles, I know
you're still mad at me

18:51.956 --> 18:53.436
for not telling you
Amy and I are trying,

18:53.480 --> 18:54.611
but I could really
use your help.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.004
- That's not all
I'm mad about, Jake.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.919
I'm upset because
you keep blowing me off.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.790
We haven't hung out
in weeks.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.314
We don't talk
on the phone anymore.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.707
I can't remember the last time
we painted pottery together.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.623
Sorry, I know this isn't
the time to talk about this.

19:06.667 --> 19:07.929
- No, no, no, keep going.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.148
It's helping to distract me
from the fact

19:09.191 --> 19:10.801
that I could fall
and instantly die.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.803
- Oh, no, from this height,
it wouldn't be instant.

19:12.847 --> 19:15.197
When you hit the ground,
your ribs would shatter,

19:15.241 --> 19:16.807
puncturing your lungs.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.941
You'd start to drown on
your own blood, gurgling and--

19:19.984 --> 19:21.160
- Okay, Adrian,
I'm being distracted

19:21.203 --> 19:22.291
by Charles right now,
thank you.

19:22.335 --> 19:23.336
- Okay.

19:23.379 --> 19:24.424
- Here, take--take my hand.

19:24.467 --> 19:25.816
I can guide you guys back.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.167
- Come on, we're a chain.
Here we go.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.081
- Just keep swimming.
- Oh, just keep swimming.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.431
- Just keep swimming.
- Oh, say it, Jake.

19:32.867 --> 19:33.824
Just keep swimming.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.130
- Good.
- Oh!

19:35.174 --> 19:36.436
- Hey, just so you know,

19:36.479 --> 19:37.654
the only reason
that I've been avoiding you

19:37.698 --> 19:39.047
is because I really
wanted to tell you

19:39.090 --> 19:40.222
what me and Amy
have been up to,

19:40.266 --> 19:41.484
and I knew the second
that I saw you,

19:41.528 --> 19:42.485
I would just blurt it out.

19:42.529 --> 19:43.834
I always
tell you everything.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.445
I hated not being able
to say anything.

19:45.488 --> 19:46.837
- Aw, that's so sweet.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.840
Your love for each other
is really wonderful.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.668
Let's hug.
Let's all hug.

19:51.712 --> 19:52.669
- Oh, no, no, no,
we're still on the ledge!

20:00.024 --> 20:02.375
Okay, this sucks.

20:02.418 --> 20:05.204
We never fight,
and then stupid Brad comes in

20:05.247 --> 20:06.683
and turns us
all against each other

20:06.727 --> 20:08.250
and now we're acting
like a bunch of kids.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.338
- Not all kids.

20:09.382 --> 20:10.513
My girls never act like this.

20:10.557 --> 20:11.732
- We may be arguing,

20:11.775 --> 20:13.864
but we're all thinking
the same thing:

20:13.908 --> 20:15.170
Terry talks about
his children too much.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.085
- Do I really?
You all think that?

20:17.128 --> 20:18.695
- Keep a lid on the box,
Pandora.

20:18.739 --> 20:19.696
You won't like what's inside.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.958
- Everybody, shut up.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.699
You're all acting
like a bunch of Ramonas.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.353
- Ramona?
- Yeah, she hated the smell

20:24.397 --> 20:26.616
of her coworker's holiday
candle, so she threw it out.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.227
It was in that thing
that you made us memorize.

20:28.270 --> 20:29.967
- You memorized it?

20:30.011 --> 20:31.882
But you said it was homework
and you don't do homework.

20:31.926 --> 20:33.710
- Yeah, well, you said
to read it, so I read it.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.364
We're a team, ya flope.

20:35.408 --> 20:36.757
- It's catching on.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.106
- Eh, I mean...

20:39.194 --> 20:41.152
- Hey, guys, it's me,
Adrian Pimento.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.242
- Hey, Pimento,
how's it going, bud?

20:43.285 --> 20:44.982
- Pretty good,
I know where I am,

20:45.026 --> 20:47.942
and I know what a table is,
so everything's going great.

20:47.985 --> 20:50.074
- Pretty low bar for greatness,
but all right.

20:50.118 --> 20:52.207
- Hey, how's it been since you
stopped taking those pills?

20:52.251 --> 20:55.645
- Well, thankfully,
my full memory has come back,

20:55.689 --> 20:57.778
even the things
that haunt me.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.790
Hey, Jake, I saw that movie
you keep talking about.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.314
- You watched "Memento"?
And what'd you think?

21:12.358 --> 21:14.751
- It's okay.

21:22.019 --> 21:24.021
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.

21:24.065 --> 21:26.110
- Fremulon.
