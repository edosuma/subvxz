15:53.153 --> 16:04.531
NINI, THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY
SPECTACULAR.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.032
YOUR ABILITY TO FLIP A SONG ON
ITS HEAD AND TURN IT INTO YOUR

16:06.032 --> 16:07.033
OWN IS NOTHING LIKE ANYTHING I
KNOW.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.435

SHE COULD PUT THIS OUT TOMORROW

17:49.369 --> 17:51.705
AND EVERYBODY WOULD BELIEVE HER.
IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING

17:51.705 --> 17:55.208
WHEN YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
IT'S LIKE, THIS IS WHO I AM.

17:55.208 --> 17:59.412
* I FOUND YOU *
>> THE FIRST VERSES FELT

17:59.412 --> 18:13.293
CONVERSATIONAL AND I LIKED THAT.
I LIKE THAT DYNAMICALLY ON THE

18:13.293 --> 18:14.627
SECOND ONE YOU WERE SOFTER.
MAYBE SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.029
>> MAYBE FROM ONE OF THE I
FOUNDS TRY DOING IT LIKE A CLIMB

18:16.029 --> 18:18.298

I NEVER HEARD THAT DONE BEFORE.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.334

I KNOW THAT THEY'RE THE TWO
PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD THAT JUST

18:32.512 --> 18:36.349
LOVE ME MORE THAN ANYBODY.
MY PARENTS ARE WATCHING EVERY

18:36.349 --> 18:39.819

18:50.330 --> 18:53.967
THIS IS AMAZING, NOT JUST FOR
ME, BUT MY FAMILY.

18:53.967 --> 18:59.739
WHEN MY FATHER GOT DIAGNOSED
WITH CANCER, I WAS 18 YEARS OLD.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.042
MY MOM GOT DIAGNOSED WHEN I WAS
21.

19:02.042 --> 19:05.145

OUR LOVED ONES BECAUSE TOMORROW

19:08.081 --> 19:10.483

THIS SONG, HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT
IT?

30:21.388 --> 30:22.622
>> I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT.
I'LL BE PLAYING THE PIANO.

30:22.622 --> 30:25.492

30:53.653 --> 30:57.924
SOUND SO DIFFERENT IS YOU CAN'T
TRY TO OUT BELT EVERYONE.

YOU HAVE TO BE THE BEST YOU CAN
BE IN YOUR OWN LANE.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.262

31:22.482 --> 31:24.884
IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN
STANDING UP AND NOT PLAYING.

31:24.884 --> 31:28.788

* I LOOKED TO THE CHILDREN *
* AND I DRANK FROM

33:13.860 --> 33:15.462
THE FOUNTAINS *
* THERE'S MORE THAN

33:15.462 --> 33:19.232
ONE ANSWER
TO THESE QUESTIONS *

33:19.232 --> 33:28.742
* POINTING ME IN
A CROOKED LINE *

HUNTLEY HAS IN ADDITION, HE'S
REALLY LIKABLE.

BRANDY NEWMAN, BUT IT'S SO
ORIGINAL.

45:18.485 --> 45:24.791

THEY WANT TO CONNECT WITH YOU.

THIS SONG.

HERE'S MORE FROM AZÁN.
>> SO, AZAN IS SPECIAL.

50:25.458 --> 50:30.463
NIALL STOLE HER.
THEN, I WAS LIKE MISSING HER.

50:30.463 --> 50:32.265
I WAS LIKE HOW DID I LET HER GO
HOME?

50:32.265 --> 50:36.069
SHE WAS ON HER WAY HOME.
THEN WE HAD THE SUPER SAVE.

51:15.375 --> 51:18.745
I'M LIKE DAD, STAY TUNED.
THIS SONG IS SOMETHING BECAUSE

51:18.745 --> 51:23.516
IT HAS SOMETHING IN IT.
AZAN HAS THE GOLDEN VOICE.

51:23.516 --> 51:30.557
THE SONG WE CHOSE IS SO GOOD.
WE WERE ABLE TO GET MS. LAURYN

51:30.557 --> 51:33.226
HILL TO CLEAR "EX FACTOR."
IT'S NEVER BEEN PERFORMED ON

51:33.226 --> 51:38.698
"THE VOICE."
THE KEY TO THIS SONG IS GOING TO

51:38.698 --> 51:40.767
BE MAKING PEOPLE FEEL THE
GUT-WRENCHING QUALITY OF THE

51:40.767 --> 51:43.336

I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD BE A
BALLAD.

I REALLY WANTED TO BRING OUT

52:22.475 --> 52:25.512
SOME OF THE BALLADY FEEL TO IT.
ONCE WE TRIED THAT, SHE KNOCKED

I SWEAR I FEEL

OF ANOTHER HAND *

01:00:09.676 --> 01:00:15.348

SEE *

* A STRANGER IN MY HOUSE *
* SOMEBODY HERE TRYING TO TAKE

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:33.233
HIM AWAY FROM ME *
* HE SITS

STARING OUT THE WINDOW
A MILLION MILES AWAY *

01:00:38.004 --> 01:00:42.742
* AND WHEN I ASK
IF HE'S ALL RIGHT

01:00:42.742 --> 01:00:45.912
HE NEVER HAS
TOO MUCH TO SAY *

01:00:45.912 --> 01:00:57.590
* SUSPICIONS LEAD
TO QUESTIONS

01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:58.958
AND QUESTIONS TO ALIBIS *
* IS IT JUST MY IMAGINATION

01:00:58.958 --> 01:01:11.738
OR HAS HIS LOVE
TURNED INTO LIES *

HERE'S MORE FROM BIAS.
>> BEING A RED NECK CAN MEAN A

01:18:18.164 --> 01:18:23.770
LOT OF THINGS.
YOU COULD BE SKINNY DIPPING OR

01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:27.374
SIPPING ON A MILKSHAKE OR
SITTING ON THE BACK DECK GETTING

01:18:27.374 --> 01:18:31.911
THAT ACTION.
THERE WAS A WASP.

YOU ALWAYS PICK THE RIGHT SONGS.

01:18:58.638 --> 01:19:03.343
>> WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT THIS SONG,
IT'S A JOHNNY CASH SONG.

01:19:03.343 --> 01:19:05.912
JOHNNY CASH WAS BORN ABOUT 45
MINUTES FROM MY HOMETOWN IN

01:19:05.912 --> 01:19:10.550

HE'S BEEN.
I THINK BIAS IS A COUNTRY SOUL

01:19:23.530 --> 01:19:27.834
CREATURE.
THE WAY YOU STARTED THE SONG,

01:19:27.834 --> 01:19:31.438
YOU'RE SINGING IT SUPER QUIET,
BUT YOU CAN BE VERY ANIMATED AND

01:19:31.438 --> 01:19:34.841
STORY TELLING.
YOU'RE TALKING TO YOURSELF, BUT

01:19:34.841 --> 01:19:46.052
YOU'RE WARNING THEM THAT THIS IS
GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:19:46.052 --> 01:19:47.454
I WANT IT TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
REALLY TELLING THE STORY WHEN

01:19:47.454 --> 01:19:48.521
YOU'RE TALKING THROUGH THE FIRST
VERSES.

01:19:48.521 --> 01:19:49.723

YOU HAVE INFORMATION THAT
EVERYBODY ELSE DOESN'T

THIS NEXT PERFORMANCE IS GOING
TO SEAL THE DEAL.
