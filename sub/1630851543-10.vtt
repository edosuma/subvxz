magic from Paige Thompson.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.888
[cheers and applause]

11:28.921 --> 11:31.923
- Hello. I need to begin
by telling you both that

11:31.956 --> 11:34.059
when you're a female
and into magic,

11:34.092 --> 11:35.894
a lot of people assume

11:35.927 --> 11:37.429
you're a witch.
[laughter]

11:37.462 --> 11:39.298
Now, the upside to this

11:39.331 --> 11:42.268
is you get some
pretty nifty witchy gifts.

11:42.301 --> 11:44.336
A lot like this pentagram.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.105
Yes, I know
what you're thinking

11:46.138 --> 11:47.807
and you are completely wrong.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.475
Hollywood and serial killers

11:49.508 --> 11:51.342
have really given these
a bad rep.

11:51.376 --> 11:55.246
They're actually intended
for your protection,

11:55.280 --> 11:59.118
especially this one,
because we have here

11:59.150 --> 12:03.121
a Penntagram.
[laughter]

12:03.154 --> 12:05.323
Yes.
And we're going to use this

12:05.356 --> 12:08.626
to test the powers
of this Penntagram

12:08.660 --> 12:12.831
to save me from a very slow
and agonizing death

12:12.865 --> 12:15.500
right here on this stage

12:15.533 --> 12:18.104
because I have brought
with me tonight

12:18.136 --> 12:21.440
a bottle of nitric acid,

12:21.474 --> 12:26.812
the key ingredient
of fertilizers and explosives.

12:26.846 --> 12:30.048
Now, you're going to know
something is truly dangerous

12:30.081 --> 12:33.485
if I'm foregoing fashion
for safety.

12:33.519 --> 12:37.789
Okay. Drinking just
a few ounces of this acid

12:37.822 --> 12:40.392
will cause you to vomit blood,

12:40.426 --> 12:43.696
which will slowly
close your throat

12:43.729 --> 12:46.698
until you suffocate and die.

12:46.731 --> 12:47.799
Super fun.

12:47.832 --> 12:50.668
I have also brought
with me water,

12:50.702 --> 12:54.807
a liquid that is
completely indistinguishable

12:54.840 --> 12:57.342
from the nitric acid.

12:57.375 --> 13:00.779
We all know water
helps plants grow,

13:00.812 --> 13:04.250
gives fishies a little place
to swim around

13:04.283 --> 13:06.785
and well, reproduce.
[laughter]

13:06.818 --> 13:11.289
A little nasty,
but it won't kill you.

13:11.322 --> 13:13.292
Okay, time now

13:13.325 --> 13:18.163

this Penntagram

13:18.197 --> 13:19.498
to protect me

13:19.532 --> 13:23.235
because we have here
three glasses full of water

13:23.269 --> 13:26.004
and one full of danger.

13:26.038 --> 13:29.808
Now, not much of a test if we
all know where the acid is.

13:29.841 --> 13:35.313
This is why I have brought
along my friend, lazy Susan.

13:35.346 --> 13:39.051
Now, Penn, I want to make this
as awkward as possible.

13:39.084 --> 13:44.056
Please gaze in to my eyes
as I spin and spin

13:44.088 --> 13:46.658
so nobody knows

13:46.692 --> 13:49.028
where the acid goes.

13:49.061 --> 13:52.230
Great. And Penn,
because you were so great,

13:52.264 --> 13:53.999
you're going to help me first.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.402
I need you to name two of these

13:56.434 --> 13:59.838

We have one, two, three, four.
Which two are safe?

14:03.708 --> 14:05.244
- Two and four.
- Two and four.

14:05.277 --> 14:10.014
You sounded confident,

or are you guessing

We did rodent roulette
on "Letterman" with rat traps.

17:55.807 --> 17:56.875

- But you did
the most important thing

17:58.176 --> 18:01.180
with danger magic,
which is keeping it safe.

18:01.212 --> 18:03.382
You know, we don't allow
anybody on the show

18:03.414 --> 18:04.715
that's actually doing something

18:04.750 --> 18:06.617
that would actually
put someone in jeopardy.

18:06.652 --> 18:10.021

playing with the danger,

18:10.055 --> 18:13.592
but also letting us know
that it was all in good fun.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.760

great things in magic,

18:15.794 --> 18:20.265

that is used for one purpose

18:20.298 --> 18:21.532

- My name is Stanley Zhou.
I'm 16 years old.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.904
I grew up in China,
but four years ago,

19:32.938 --> 19:36.575
my mom brought me and my
brother from China to the U.S.

19:36.607 --> 19:38.777
I was always
very shy and awkward.

19:38.809 --> 19:41.279
And now on top of that,
I didn't speak any English,

19:41.313 --> 19:42.914
so I couldn't talk to anyone.

19:42.948 --> 19:47.118
So I taught myself English
with thousands of index cards.

19:47.152 --> 19:50.189
In some ways,
that was my first card trick.

19:50.221 --> 19:54.292
Eventually, I discovered magic
and it became my super power

19:54.326 --> 19:57.296
because now I can suddenly
connect with people

19:57.328 --> 20:00.432
and make friends
without any language barriers.

20:00.464 --> 20:02.166
I'll admit it,
I'm very ambitious.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.137
My two biggest passions
are fencing and magic.

20:06.171 --> 20:07.605
When I started fencing,

20:07.638 --> 20:11.643
I always wanted to go to the
nationals, which I have.

20:11.676 --> 20:16.381
And when I started doing magic,
I practice every day for hours.

20:16.414 --> 20:18.951

I'm on "Fool Us."

20:18.983 --> 20:20.419

20:20.451 --> 20:23.221
you guys have been doing magic
a lot longer than I have,

20:23.255 --> 20:26.157

to fool you.

to fool you with a card trick.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.181
So I won't. Instead,

20:49.213 --> 20:52.750
I'm going to try and fool you
with a physics experiment.

20:52.784 --> 20:55.953
Now, this physics experiment
requires three red cards

20:55.988 --> 20:57.122
and three black cards.

- Yes.

21:07.699 --> 21:09.166
- Perfect.

21:09.201 --> 21:11.803
This deck will be
our scientific control group.

21:11.836 --> 21:14.905
I'll set it aside for now
and I won't touch it.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.976
Now, my research has shown
that black ink weighs

21:18.009 --> 21:19.711
more than red ink.

21:19.744 --> 21:22.146
To demonstrate this,
I'll separate the cards,

21:22.180 --> 21:23.848
three blacks, three reds.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.784
And I'll mix them up
alternating.

21:25.817 --> 21:29.921
Black, red,
black, red, black, red.

21:29.954 --> 21:31.957
If I pick them up
and drop them,

21:31.990 --> 21:34.492
the heavier black ink
will cause the black cards

21:34.526 --> 21:35.861
to pass through the red cards.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.561
And then they end up
on the bottom.

21:37.596 --> 21:42.534
Let me show you.
There.

21:42.567 --> 21:44.236
I think that did it.

21:44.269 --> 21:45.936
If we take a look now,

21:45.971 --> 21:50.208
the first card,
that's a red card.

21:50.241 --> 21:51.977
The second card,
it used to be a black card,

21:52.009 --> 21:56.548
but since we dropped them,
it's also a red card.

21:56.580 --> 22:00.152
And the third card,
another red card.

22:00.184 --> 22:01.420
Thank you.
[applause]

22:01.452 --> 22:03.989
And if you're wondering,
over here

22:04.021 --> 22:07.992
are the three black cards.
[applause]

22:08.026 --> 22:10.295
Thank you.
Now, I don't know about you,

22:10.328 --> 22:12.263
but that seemed
pretty fair to me.

22:12.297 --> 22:15.299
However, I still sense
some skepticism,

22:15.334 --> 22:19.104
which is fine because science,
like magic, needs skeptics.

22:19.136 --> 22:21.105
So I'll demonstrate this again.

22:21.138 --> 22:24.442
And this time you'll know
exactly what to look for.

22:24.476 --> 22:26.510
Penn, what color
are these cards?

22:26.545 --> 22:28.180
- Black.
- Exactly.

22:28.212 --> 22:31.349
So that means that Teller
must have the three red cards.

22:31.383 --> 22:35.186
If you don't trust me, you can
check again to make sure.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.823
He doesn't trust me.
[laughter]

22:37.855 --> 22:40.424
Here, help me mix the red cards
into black cards,

22:40.459 --> 22:42.326
just like this.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.962
First one.

22:44.996 --> 22:48.266
Good.

22:48.299 --> 22:51.103
And perfect.

22:51.135 --> 22:54.772
Now, once again,
we're going to drop the cards

22:54.806 --> 22:58.509
and the black cards are going
to pass through the red cards.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.545
I saw it.
Did you see it? Penn? Teller?

23:00.578 --> 23:02.213
- I didn't.
- You didn't?

23:02.247 --> 23:03.214
- I didn't
- Come on.

23:03.248 --> 23:04.482
You're my independent observer.

23:04.516 --> 23:06.250
- I didn't see them
actually move.

23:06.284 --> 23:07.519
It just looked like
you dropped them.

23:07.551 --> 23:10.654
- Well, who knows?
Maybe it worked.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.457
Let's check it out.

23:12.490 --> 23:17.261
First card is red.

23:17.295 --> 23:19.998
Red.

23:20.030 --> 23:22.601
And red. Thank you.
[applause]

23:22.634 --> 23:26.505
And over here.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.240
Thank you.
[applause]

23:28.272 --> 23:30.040
- Very nice.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.177
- I'll admit that
while this experiment

23:33.211 --> 23:36.781
appears to have been perfectly
and scientifically fair,

23:36.815 --> 23:39.651
I did handle the cards
after Teller mixed them.

23:39.683 --> 23:43.721
And as a magician physicist
with incredibly fast fingers...

23:43.755 --> 23:45.990
[laughter]
I might've done something.

23:46.023 --> 23:49.059
I might have used
sleight of hand. Who knows?

23:49.094 --> 23:51.229
So for those of you
who still may be thinking

23:51.262 --> 23:54.332
that this is a card trick
and not a physics experiment

23:54.365 --> 23:56.167
and to put all doubt to rest,

23:56.201 --> 23:59.837
I'm going to create a condition
that only physics can solve.

23:59.871 --> 24:03.040
I have invented a sleight
of hand prevention machine.

24:03.074 --> 24:06.344
The first part
is this hole punch.

24:06.377 --> 24:08.446
Penn, you can check that out.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.615
And the second part
is the paper fastener.

24:11.650 --> 24:12.750
- Okay.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.920
- Teller,
you can take a look at that.

24:14.952 --> 24:17.689
Now to prevent sleight of hand,
we just punch a hole

24:17.721 --> 24:20.325
in each one of my fingers.
[laughter]

24:20.357 --> 24:21.893
Just kidding.

24:21.926 --> 24:25.196
What we're actually going to do
is punch a hole in the cards.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.998
There we go. That's good.

24:27.031 --> 24:30.602
And we're going to use
that paper fastener. Thank you,

24:30.634 --> 24:33.771
To make sure that
I can't use sleight of hand

24:33.805 --> 24:37.442
to make the cards move,
just like this.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.243
Now, if you take a look,
the cards are really

24:39.277 --> 24:42.314
alternating red, black,
red, black, red, black.

24:42.346 --> 24:43.647
And you can see
that there's no way

24:43.682 --> 24:45.115
we can change
the order of the cards

24:45.150 --> 24:47.251
no matter
which way we turned them.

24:47.285 --> 24:50.087
And if you think about it,
if this were a card trick,

24:50.121 --> 24:52.723
the paper fastener
will make it impossible.

24:52.757 --> 24:56.528
But this isn't a card trick,
it's a physics experiment.

the real physical evidence

The stack of cards.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.490
Remember,
it was totally mixed up

25:26.525 --> 25:29.728
before I set it down

25:47.846 --> 25:49.180
Thank you, Penn.
Thank you, Teller.

25:49.213 --> 25:53.084
- Can we take these with us?
- Sure, go ahead.

25:53.117 --> 25:56.253
- Stanley Zhou. Hi.
- Hi.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.957
- So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.559
- You're so incredible.
- Thank you so much.

26:01.593 --> 26:03.361
- How long have you been
doing this?

26:03.394 --> 26:04.729
- Doing magic?
- Yeah.

26:04.762 --> 26:06.196
- Only about three years.

26:06.230 --> 26:07.432
- Wow.
- Yeah.

26:07.464 --> 26:10.000
- Three years and you're
already here at "Fool Us"

26:10.035 --> 26:12.403
doing close-up magic
with Penn and Teller.

26:12.436 --> 26:13.571
- Yes.

26:13.605 --> 26:15.006
- And is your family
supportive?

26:15.039 --> 26:16.106
- Yes, of course.
- Yeah.

26:16.141 --> 26:17.675
- I wouldn't be here
without them.

26:17.709 --> 26:19.109
- [chuckling]
That's true.

26:19.144 --> 26:22.047
It's so brave to do these
tricks with Penn and Teller

26:22.079 --> 26:24.048
sitting right in front of you.
[chuckles]

26:24.082 --> 26:26.250
- Well, of course,
I was nervous at first,

26:26.284 --> 26:29.721
but once I got out,
I just kinda got into the zone.

26:29.753 --> 26:32.824
- And so are you actually good
at physics as well?

26:32.856 --> 26:33.959
- Yeah.

26:33.991 --> 26:35.693
- I feel like you're good
at everything.

26:35.727 --> 26:36.927
It's just a hunch.

26:36.961 --> 26:38.496
- I don't know, actually.
- [laughs]

26:38.529 --> 26:41.132
What other goals do you have
for yourself?

26:41.165 --> 26:43.667
- I really,
really enjoy fencing.

26:43.701 --> 26:46.104
- Ooh.
- It's just a really cool

26:46.136 --> 26:49.173
combination of mental
and physical skills.

26:49.207 --> 26:50.642
- All right, Stanley.

26:50.674 --> 26:52.576
Let's see if Penn and Teller
know how you did your trick.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.346
- All right.

26:55.380 --> 26:56.914
- Stanley.

26:56.948 --> 26:57.949
- [chuckles]
- Yes.

26:57.982 --> 27:00.085
- I want to apologize to you

27:00.117 --> 27:03.288
'cause I think I cheated
a little bit on the game.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.722
I asked you at the end,

27:04.756 --> 27:07.925
if I could take this prop
with me

27:07.959 --> 27:10.394
and I'm really not
supposed to do that.

27:10.428 --> 27:13.798
I mean, during this section,
I can ask about props,

27:13.832 --> 27:16.667
but I'm not supposed to
within the performance,

27:16.701 --> 27:19.104
ask to grab something
you didn't offer to me.

27:19.136 --> 27:22.740
And when I did it,
my heart kind of sunk

27:22.773 --> 27:25.509
because I said, here's
this guy, he 16-years-old.

27:25.542 --> 27:27.345
You've been in the country.
What? Three years?

27:27.378 --> 27:28.747
- Three, four years.

27:28.779 --> 27:30.914
- Four years.
Been in the country four years,

27:30.949 --> 27:32.750
learning English,
learning magic.

27:32.784 --> 27:36.287
I'm here on our show

27:36.320 --> 27:38.890
and it was kind
of a [bleep] move...

27:38.923 --> 27:40.191
[laughter]

27:40.224 --> 27:42.426
To say, "Can I take this?"
and put you on the spot.

27:42.460 --> 27:45.096
You don't have a choice.
You can't say no,

27:45.130 --> 27:47.265
because that shows
how the trick is done.

27:47.298 --> 27:49.433
So you have to say yes,
then we take it away.

27:49.467 --> 27:53.438
And we bust the trick.
So I--I--I apologize.

27:53.471 --> 27:55.973
I don't feel like
this is good or righteous

27:56.007 --> 27:57.075
or I did the right thing.

27:57.107 --> 28:00.979
I feel like I cheated
on the game

28:01.011 --> 28:03.213
and then I looked at this prop
and...

28:03.248 --> 28:04.582
- Yeah.

28:07.919 --> 28:09.386
- [snorting chuckle]
- You fooled us.

28:09.421 --> 28:12.123
- [gasps] You did it!
[cheers and applause]

28:12.156 --> 28:15.226
- Thank you.
- Yay! Congratulations!

28:15.259 --> 28:17.961
- I'm kind of exonerated
from my cheating

28:17.996 --> 28:20.898
because you fooled us anyway.
[cheers and applause]

28:20.932 --> 28:25.903
- Thank you so much.
Thank you, Penn.

28:25.936 --> 28:28.472
Thank you, Teller.
- I shouldn't have done that.

28:28.506 --> 28:29.574
- Thank you.

28:29.606 --> 28:31.041
- I shouldn't have done that
but--

28:31.076 --> 28:33.411
- Stanley Zhou!
- Thank you.

28:33.444 --> 28:36.047
[cheers and applause]

28:36.080 --> 28:37.781
- [chuckles]

28:37.816 --> 28:41.486
There goes one fine Fooler
with a "Fool Us" trophy.

28:41.519 --> 28:44.189
Can another magician fool
our boys tonight?

28:44.221 --> 28:46.090
Come back and find out.

28:46.124 --> 28:48.625
[cheers and applause]

28:56.067 --> 28:59.269
[cheers and applause]

28:59.304 --> 29:00.672
- Welcome back.

29:00.704 --> 29:03.674
Penn and Teller gave up
one "Fool Us" trophy so far.

29:03.708 --> 29:06.510
They might give away another
to our next act.

29:06.544 --> 29:08.011
Let's meet them.

29:10.347 --> 29:12.317
- I'm a Michigan magician.

29:12.349 --> 29:14.018
Try to say
that five times fast.

29:14.051 --> 29:15.385
I met my girlfriend, Jasmine,

29:15.420 --> 29:16.954
at a magic convention
in Michigan

29:16.988 --> 29:18.722
called the
"Abbott's Magic Get Together"

29:18.757 --> 29:20.157
where we were both performing.

29:20.191 --> 29:21.492
She really put a spell on me.

29:21.526 --> 29:23.127
Fast forward a year,

29:23.161 --> 29:25.329
and we have a little girl
named Paizley Abbott.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.898
And that's so we remember
where she sprang from.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.433
We do a lot of county fairs,

29:29.467 --> 29:32.302
traveling around Michigan
and the Midwest.

29:32.336 --> 29:35.839
I have a 30-foot trailer
with a built-in stage

29:35.874 --> 29:38.542
and my very own
animatronic chicken.

29:38.576 --> 29:39.877
[laughter]

29:39.911 --> 29:42.212
People ask me if I ever want
to open a show in Vegas.

29:42.247 --> 29:45.115
And I tell them, no, I'll
do it right here in Michigan,

29:45.150 --> 29:46.917
'cause that's my home.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.752
Tonight, I'll be
bringing out a trick

29:48.787 --> 29:51.221
that's taken me five years
to perfect.

29:51.256 --> 29:52.656
Since Battle Creek, Michigan

29:52.690 --> 29:54.392
is the cereal center
of the world,

29:54.424 --> 29:57.261
it takes a Michigan magician
to pull it off.

29:57.295 --> 30:01.833
Penn, Teller, prepare for the
breakfast of magical champions.

30:02.733 --> 30:05.502
[cheers and applause]

30:05.537 --> 30:09.941
- Give it up for Michigan's own
Jonathan Lachance.

30:09.973 --> 30:11.509
[cheers and applause]

30:11.542 --> 30:12.977
- When I was a kid, to me,

30:13.010 --> 30:16.748
nothing said magic more
than a bowl in a box of cereal.

30:16.780 --> 30:19.450
And I'm not even talking
about the food.

30:19.483 --> 30:21.853
I mean, on the inside
of every single box,

30:21.885 --> 30:23.555
there was a prize
at the bottom,

30:23.587 --> 30:26.324
pour out some sugary,
over-processed grain,

30:26.356 --> 30:28.692
get a toy. Magic.
[audience murmurs]

30:28.726 --> 30:32.063
Yeah, I know this was just a
cheap hook to sell more cereal,

30:32.096 --> 30:34.531
but guess what?
It worked.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.669
Penn and Teller,
in front of you is an envelope.

30:37.701 --> 30:41.205
Would you please open it?

30:41.239 --> 30:42.707
Inside, you'll find a list

30:42.740 --> 30:47.045
containing the top 20 common
items found in cereal boxes,

30:47.077 --> 30:49.980
things like baseball cards,
snap bracelets,

30:50.013 --> 30:52.450
and my personal favorite,
the mini terrarium,

30:52.482 --> 30:54.853
because who doesn't like
a tiny garden of weeds

30:54.885 --> 30:57.288
as a side order for cereal?
[laughter]

30:57.322 --> 31:01.226
If you both could settle on
one prize you see on the list.

31:01.259 --> 31:03.560
- No, no, they don't do that.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.829
- Okay. We got one.
- All right. And what is it?

31:05.864 --> 31:07.097
- X-ray specs.

31:07.131 --> 31:09.166
- X-ray specs.
Excellent choice.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.734
- Thank you.
- Okay.

31:10.768 --> 31:13.171
So now that we have the prize,
it's time to select the cereal.

31:13.203 --> 31:15.006
And Alyson,
would you mind joining me

31:15.038 --> 31:16.273
at the breakfast table?

31:16.307 --> 31:17.674
- Gladly.

31:17.709 --> 31:21.378
- So I have a bag with six mini
cereal boxes in it.

31:21.412 --> 31:24.515
And can you verify
the bag is empty?

31:24.548 --> 31:25.817
- Yes.
- Awesome.

31:25.849 --> 31:28.318
And let's see
what choices we have.

31:28.353 --> 31:30.654
We have Huffle Puffs.
[laughter]

31:30.688 --> 31:34.726
Okay.
We have Malt-O Magic.

31:34.759 --> 31:38.730
And we have Presto Pops...
- Mm.

31:38.762 --> 31:41.732
- Mysteerios...
[laughter]

31:41.766 --> 31:44.501
Hocus Oatus...
[laughter]

31:44.535 --> 31:48.538
and lastly, Abra-cadapples.
[laughter]

31:48.573 --> 31:51.308
Okay. Alyson, if you could
please shake up the bags

31:51.342 --> 31:53.778
so we can make
a totally random selection.

31:53.810 --> 31:58.615
Okay, keep shaking it up.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.451
You good? Okay, great.
[laughter]

32:01.486 --> 32:03.621
Now that you've mixed up
our choices, let's pick one.

32:03.654 --> 32:07.458
Reach inside and grab one box.
And what do we have?

32:07.491 --> 32:09.760
- Yay, Presto Pops.
- Presto Pops.

32:09.794 --> 32:12.462
And here's what
we could have had.

32:12.497 --> 32:15.266
And Alyson, you want to know
something weird?

32:15.299 --> 32:17.268
I knew that you were
going to pick this cereal

32:17.301 --> 32:20.038
and that's because
it matches my prediction.

32:20.070 --> 32:21.873
- Oh.

32:21.905 --> 32:23.740
- It gets better. Watch.

32:23.775 --> 32:29.180
If we open up the box here
on the inside...

32:29.212 --> 32:30.315
Presto Pops.

32:30.347 --> 32:32.916
- Wow.
[applause]

32:32.951 --> 32:35.319
- Now--but there's more, okay?

32:35.353 --> 32:39.123
If we fold up the box here--

32:39.156 --> 32:41.092
and we have to use
a little magic for this,

32:41.125 --> 32:45.229
and I think you actually have
something we need right here.

32:45.262 --> 32:47.230
Just like that.
Hold on to that for me.

32:47.265 --> 32:50.000
And take the bowl
and hold it right there

32:50.034 --> 32:52.269
and wave the spoon
over the top of the box

32:52.302 --> 32:53.837
and say,
"sugar coma in a bowl."

32:53.871 --> 32:55.740
[laughter]
- Sugar coma in a bowl.

32:55.772 --> 32:57.307
- And watch this.
- Wow.

32:57.342 --> 32:59.277
- Just like that,
we have something

32:59.309 --> 33:01.179
inside--inside the box
right there,

33:01.211 --> 33:03.513
we have Presto Pops,
but there's actually a prize.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.349
Penn, what was the prize
you guys selected?

33:05.383 --> 33:06.616
- X-ray specs.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.684
- You had a free choice
out of 20.

33:07.719 --> 33:10.054
- We did.
- And what is in there?

33:10.087 --> 33:11.556
[audience exclaims]

33:11.588 --> 33:14.358
X-ray specs.
Now, here's the thing.

33:14.392 --> 33:16.693
We have 98% of the trick.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.063
We have the bowl,
we have the prize,

33:19.096 --> 33:21.398
we have the spoon,
and we have the cereal.

33:21.432 --> 33:23.835
The only thing we need now
is the--here.

33:23.867 --> 33:25.470
You know what?
Take a look inside the box.

33:25.502 --> 33:26.738
Do you see anything
at the bottom?

33:26.770 --> 33:28.506
- No.
- No?

33:28.538 --> 33:30.674
That's because--oh.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.977
Well, I guess there's one thing
that got past your eyes.

33:33.010 --> 33:34.746
And when, I mean,
past your eyes,

33:34.778 --> 33:38.048
I'm talking about the other 2%.
[audience exclaims]

33:38.082 --> 33:41.051
And that's a magical breakfast
of champions.

33:41.085 --> 33:44.255
[applause]
- Jonathan Lachance.

33:44.288 --> 33:46.790
[cheers and applause]
[indistinct chatter]

33:46.824 --> 33:50.627
So your mom never told you
to not play with your food?

33:50.661 --> 33:51.929
- No. Well, that was
the biggest thing.

33:51.962 --> 33:53.865
I used to take my grubby
little paws and stick them

33:53.897 --> 33:55.500
all the way at the bottom
searching for that toy.

33:55.532 --> 33:58.236
- Yes, or you could just
flip it open

33:58.269 --> 33:59.636
and open it from the bottom.

33:59.670 --> 34:00.904
- Yeah.
I never thought of that.

34:00.938 --> 34:05.175
- Right. So is this the trick
you're known for?

34:05.209 --> 34:06.576
- So this is actually a trick

34:06.611 --> 34:08.478
that I've been working on
for like five years and...

34:08.512 --> 34:09.947
- Wow.
- And kind of a trick

34:09.981 --> 34:11.681
I really wanted to do
on this show.

34:11.715 --> 34:14.117
- It's pretty awesome.
- Thank you.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.653
- Have you done lots
of virtual magic this year?

34:16.686 --> 34:17.789
- I did.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.590
I did a show for like
over 5,000 people

34:19.623 --> 34:20.757
all over the world.

34:20.791 --> 34:22.827
- So how else did you spend
your time?

34:22.860 --> 34:25.195
- I became a firefighter.

34:25.228 --> 34:26.364
- What!
- Yes.

34:26.396 --> 34:27.632
- That's amazing.

34:27.664 --> 34:28.833
- Yeah. I like to do stuff

34:28.865 --> 34:30.568
in the public
and help the public out.

34:30.601 --> 34:34.105
And with magic, I've done a lot
of, like, charity events

34:34.137 --> 34:36.574
and so it was just kind of
a give back thing

34:36.606 --> 34:37.942
that I wanted to do.

34:37.974 --> 34:39.976
- All right, Jonathan,
let's see if Penn and Teller

34:40.010 --> 34:42.012
can see through
your cereal trick.

34:42.045 --> 34:43.481
- Awesome.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.884
- Hey John, I'll tell you,
you've made "Fool Us" history.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.219
- Yeah?

34:48.251 --> 34:51.422
- We have not seen
a cereal magic routine before.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.856
- Awesome.
- You've got it.

34:52.889 --> 34:55.092
You own that whole area.
- Yeah.

34:55.126 --> 34:57.494
- That was really,
really nice and funny.

34:57.527 --> 35:01.398
And there's also, it's such
a magical premise, you know,

35:01.431 --> 35:04.802
to have a box of cereal,
you know,

35:04.835 --> 35:06.971
and have something
hidden in that box

35:07.003 --> 35:10.675
is just this magical idea
that you're going to find--

35:10.708 --> 35:12.610
you're going to find
the whole secret in the box

35:12.643 --> 35:13.811
when you pour the stuff out.

35:13.844 --> 35:15.880
Now, remember that
when I was a child,

35:15.913 --> 35:17.949
you know, I had this little--

35:17.981 --> 35:19.851
I had a little bag
that I carried to school.

35:19.884 --> 35:21.585
My mom would give me change
in the bag.

35:21.619 --> 35:22.719
I hid the change in the bag.

35:22.753 --> 35:24.155
I'd go to the store,
buy the cereal,

35:24.188 --> 35:26.224
then hidden in the box
was the whole secret.

35:26.257 --> 35:28.492
And I'd pull that out
and it was just great.

35:28.525 --> 35:30.327
And I don't think
you expected to fool us

35:30.360 --> 35:33.965
with how you poured the milk
out and the cereal out.

35:33.998 --> 35:35.465
We had a pretty
good idea on that.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.835
And I think that as you're
listening between the lines

35:38.869 --> 35:41.539
or underlining certain words
that I said,

35:41.572 --> 35:43.773
I think you have an idea
what I'm saying to you

35:43.807 --> 35:45.876
and I don't think
you fooled us.

35:45.909 --> 35:48.278
- I did not.
- Aw.

35:48.311 --> 35:50.081
Oh, well, Jonathan,
you didn't fool them,

35:50.114 --> 35:52.083
but we absolutely loved
that trick.

35:52.115 --> 35:53.985
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

35:54.018 --> 35:58.054
- Jonathan Lachance.
[cheers and applause]

35:59.623 --> 36:01.759
Penn and Teller
have talked the talk.

36:01.791 --> 36:04.795
Now they get to walk the walk
with a trick of their own

36:04.829 --> 36:06.530
when "Fool Us" returns.

36:06.563 --> 36:07.965
[cheers and applause]

36:16.541 --> 36:18.943
[cheers and applause]

36:18.976 --> 36:22.547
- Joined by a randomly-selected
host of this show,

36:22.579 --> 36:25.849
give it up for our headliners,
Penn and Teller.

36:25.882 --> 36:28.485
[cheers and applause]

36:28.518 --> 36:30.487
- Alyson,
so many of these shows,

36:30.521 --> 36:32.056
we've done a trick for you
at the end.

36:32.088 --> 36:34.692
We think tonight,
you should do a trick for us,

36:34.724 --> 36:37.327
more specifically for Teller.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.329
You'll do all of this.

36:38.362 --> 36:39.764
I'll just kind of
talk you through.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.498
You've seen a lot
of magicians work.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.534
You know the basic idea,
just go through it.

36:43.568 --> 36:45.068
First, pull out
your deck of cards.

36:45.101 --> 36:47.804
Open them up.
- Oh, jeez.

36:47.838 --> 36:49.574
- Beautiful. Pull out
the cards, pull out the cards.

36:49.606 --> 36:51.041
You can throw the empty box
on the floor

36:51.074 --> 36:53.210
and get rid of--beautiful.
Now, give the cards a shuffle.

36:53.244 --> 36:54.911
Say, "Teller,
watch me shuffle."

36:54.945 --> 36:57.914
- Shuffle. I mean,
Teller, watch me shuffle.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.449
[laughter]
Not closely.

36:59.483 --> 37:00.717
- Do a legitimate shuffle.

37:00.751 --> 37:02.719
- I'm trying, but
it's a little intimidating.

37:02.753 --> 37:04.322
- Do a legitimate shuffle.
- You guys are really, like...

37:04.355 --> 37:05.690
- There you go.
Shuffle like a freak.

37:05.722 --> 37:07.023
- Really famous magicians.
- Shuffle like a freak.

37:07.057 --> 37:08.525
Beautiful, beautiful.

37:08.559 --> 37:10.094
Want to shuffle some more?
Shuffle some more.

37:10.126 --> 37:11.195
- My daughters always say

37:11.228 --> 37:12.762
I need
to practice shuffling more.

37:12.797 --> 37:14.197
- There you go.
- They're right.

37:14.231 --> 37:15.599
- Now, give 'em a cut,
give 'em a cut.

37:15.632 --> 37:17.969
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

37:18.001 --> 37:19.036
- And when you complete
the cut,

37:19.070 --> 37:20.036
now say, "Teller."

37:20.070 --> 37:21.405
- Teller!
- "Pick a card."

37:21.438 --> 37:22.606
What you are going to do
is spread them out like this.

37:22.639 --> 37:23.740
Turn them over like that.

37:23.773 --> 37:24.875
- Gosh.
- Spread them out just like

37:24.909 --> 37:26.978
that and say,
"pick any card you want."

37:27.010 --> 37:28.311
- Pick a card,
any card you want!

37:28.346 --> 37:30.047
- Get in your head. Okay.
He has got one.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.583
- He has got one.
- Now, gather them up like that

37:32.617 --> 37:34.485
and turn the deck over,
facedown,

37:34.518 --> 37:36.387
put it right down there
and say, "Teller."

37:36.420 --> 37:37.688
- Teller!

37:37.722 --> 37:38.822
- "You're going to
remember your card?"

37:38.856 --> 37:39.889
- You're going to remember
your card?

37:39.923 --> 37:41.659
- "Wait a minute, Teller."

37:41.692 --> 37:44.161
- Wait a minute, Teller.
- "You're a slimy weasel."

37:44.195 --> 37:47.231
- You're a slimy, cute weasel.
[laughter]

37:47.264 --> 37:49.065
- "Who has been riding
his whole career

37:49.099 --> 37:50.300
on the back of Penn."

37:50.333 --> 37:51.469
- [laughing]
Who's been--

37:51.501 --> 37:52.469
- You don't have to say that.
- Okay.

37:52.503 --> 37:54.038
- Just say,

37:54.070 --> 37:56.206
"But I think you might change
your mind just to screw me up."

37:56.239 --> 37:59.076
- I think you might change
your mind just to screw me up.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.445
- "So write down the name
of the card you picked."

38:01.478 --> 38:04.748
- So write down the name
of the card you picked.

38:04.782 --> 38:05.983
Oh, he--

38:06.016 --> 38:06.983
- "Just write it on your arm.
Who cares?"

38:07.018 --> 38:08.219
- On your arm.
Who cares?

38:08.251 --> 38:09.452
- "Write down the name
of the card you picked."

38:09.487 --> 38:12.088
- Write it down.
Don't let me see.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.057
- Don't--yeah, that's good.
That's a good ad-lib.

38:14.090 --> 38:15.525
- Okay, good.
- Really good.

38:15.559 --> 38:17.795
Now say, "I will find
your card, Teller."

38:17.827 --> 38:19.396
- I will find your card,
Teller.

38:19.429 --> 38:22.333
- Oh no, no. Watch this.
Show both hands empty.

38:22.365 --> 38:24.034
Show it to Teller.
You've seen all this.

38:24.068 --> 38:26.570
Now say,
"I'll cut right to your card."

38:26.603 --> 38:28.204
- I will cut
right to your card.

38:28.239 --> 38:29.239
- Now, listen carefully Alyson.

38:29.273 --> 38:31.242
Cut about a third
of the way down,

38:31.275 --> 38:33.443
then turn it over
and put the right back on top.

38:33.476 --> 38:35.146
- A third of the way down.
- Perfect.

38:35.179 --> 38:36.579
- Right here.
Oh, gosh.

38:36.614 --> 38:37.748
- Turn it over, turn it over.
- Turn it over.

38:37.782 --> 38:38.983
- And then, put it back
right on top.

38:39.016 --> 38:40.217
- And then--oh, right on top.
- Beautiful.

38:40.251 --> 38:42.152
And say," Five of hearts.
Is that your card?"

38:42.186 --> 38:44.355
- Five of hearts!
Is that your card?

38:44.387 --> 38:45.588
Oh, no.

38:45.623 --> 38:46.690
- Now, you gotta bail out
of it.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.793
You say,
"Of course it's not your card.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.393
- Of course,
It's not your card.

38:50.427 --> 38:52.762
- "That would be too easy."
- That'd be too easy.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.231
- "Watch this."
- Watch this.

38:54.264 --> 38:55.932
- Now you're going to cut
a little deeper.

38:55.965 --> 38:58.501
Cut a little deeper, like
two-thirds of the way down.

38:58.536 --> 39:00.237
- Two-thirds. Okay.

39:00.271 --> 39:02.072
- Now turn it over
just like you did before.

39:02.106 --> 39:03.507
Put it right back
down there and say,

39:03.541 --> 39:04.641
"Three of hearts.
Is that your card?"

39:04.675 --> 39:06.643
- Three of hearts.
Is that your card?

39:06.677 --> 39:09.112
Aw. That would be way too easy.
[laughter]

39:09.146 --> 39:11.449
- Way too easy, way too easy.
- Way too easy.

39:11.481 --> 39:12.650
- "Watch this, Teller."

39:12.682 --> 39:15.186
- I will get this
in at least 52 more tries.

39:15.219 --> 39:16.820
- Show your hands over there.

39:16.853 --> 39:18.322
And them just spread
them out like this.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.690
Just spread them out.

39:20.724 --> 39:25.730
Now, take all the face-up
cards.

39:25.762 --> 39:27.797
You got to throw them down
over there with disdain

39:27.831 --> 39:29.132
and say, "none of them!"

39:29.166 --> 39:31.835
- None of them!
- Oh, your disdain is good.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.371
- [growling]
Yeah.

39:33.403 --> 39:34.672
- Now, get the card you cut
through, that card right there.

39:34.704 --> 39:35.940
Slide it over here.
Okay.

39:35.972 --> 39:38.175
Now take all those cards,
gather those cards,

39:38.208 --> 39:41.277
and then throw them down
with disdain and say,

39:41.311 --> 39:42.480
"None of them!"

39:42.512 --> 39:44.014
- None of them!
[laughter]

39:44.047 --> 39:46.951
- Boy, your disdain--you got
a lot of hate there, don't you?

39:46.983 --> 39:48.219
- I'm so excited.

39:48.251 --> 39:49.452
- So there's one card left.
Don't look at--

39:49.487 --> 39:50.820
- I guess your energy
is very contagious.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.056
- "Don't look at it."
- Don't look at it.

39:52.088 --> 39:53.757
- Just say,
"That's one card left."

39:53.791 --> 39:56.293
- One--one card left.
- Then say--

39:56.327 --> 39:58.362
then you're gonna do a recap
that's called closing the door.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.663
- Okay.
- You're going to say,

39:59.697 --> 40:01.831
"First of all,
you saw me shuffle the deck."

40:01.865 --> 40:03.634
- First of all,
you saw me shuffle the deck.

40:03.666 --> 40:06.036
- "And you picked one card
just in your mind."

40:06.070 --> 40:07.670
- You picked one card
just in your mind.

40:07.704 --> 40:09.672
- "I had you write it down
because you're a slimy weasel."

40:09.706 --> 40:13.110
- I had you write it down
because you're a cute weasel.

40:13.143 --> 40:15.612
- "And then I shuffled
and cut repeatedly."

40:15.646 --> 40:17.715
- And then I shuffled
and I cut repeatedly.

40:17.748 --> 40:19.215
- "And there's only
one card left."

40:19.250 --> 40:20.384
- And there's only
one card left.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.619
- "And I can't change my mind."

40:21.652 --> 40:23.019
- And I can't change my mind.

40:23.052 --> 40:24.221
- "And you can't
change your mind."

40:24.255 --> 40:25.523
- And you can't change
your mind.

40:25.556 --> 40:26.690
- "Watch this, Teller.

40:26.724 --> 40:28.391
Alyson is going
to blow your mind."

40:28.425 --> 40:30.161
- I'm going to blow your mind!

40:30.193 --> 40:31.327
- "Teller, what card
did you pick?"

40:31.362 --> 40:33.998
- "What card did you pick?"

40:34.030 --> 40:35.865
- Six of--
- The six of spades.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.067
Watch this, Teller.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.369
Show both your hands empty

40:38.402 --> 40:39.769
then show Teller
your hands empty.

40:39.804 --> 40:41.806
Then reach down,
take that card.

40:41.838 --> 40:43.072
Take a look at it
and make sure you're right

40:43.106 --> 40:45.141
so don't freak out.

40:45.175 --> 40:46.443
- [shouts]
[audience exclaims]

40:46.476 --> 40:50.047
- The six of spades!
- Six of spades!

40:50.079 --> 40:53.184
I did it!
- Yes, that's Alyson!

40:53.217 --> 40:55.518
I wanna thank you from all
of tonight's magicians,

40:55.552 --> 40:57.086
including Alyson.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.123
Goodnight from Las Vegas.

40:59.155 --> 41:01.559
Tune in next week
to see Alyson Hannigan

41:01.592 --> 41:03.960
and all her shenanigans.
- [laughs]

41:03.994 --> 41:06.329
- Yay, it's, like, so easy.

41:06.362 --> 41:08.231
- Easy?
[laughter]

41:08.264 --> 41:09.300
- I loved that.
