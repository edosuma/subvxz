00:20.918 --> 00:24.518
(fluorescent sign buzzing)

00:28.524 --> 00:32.229
(frenetic electronic music)

00:51.712 --> 00:55.252
(intense orchestral music)

01:21.148 --> 01:22.939
- [Announcer] The stock
market is in turmoil today.

01:22.974 --> 01:25.546
- This GameStop
situation is the craziest

01:25.581 --> 01:26.613
I think I've ever seen.

01:26.648 --> 01:28.076
- I want to talk about GameStop.

01:28.111 --> 01:28.912
- GameStop.
- GameStop.

01:28.947 --> 01:29.880
- GameStop!

01:29.915 --> 01:30.749
- GameStop.
- GameStop.

01:30.784 --> 01:31.981
- GameStop.
- GameStop.

01:32.016 --> 01:33.323
- GameStop.
- GameStop.

01:33.358 --> 01:37.261
- This crazy GameStop
stock market story.

01:37.296 --> 01:38.889
- I was like, oh my God,

01:38.924 --> 01:41.133
we actually can use
shares as our weapons

01:41.168 --> 01:42.728
against Wall Street,

01:42.763 --> 01:43.828
so hit 'em where it hurts

01:43.863 --> 01:45.137
and take their money
away from them.

01:45.172 --> 01:46.963
- It's interesting, isn't it?

01:46.998 --> 01:49.097
- Everyone is talking
about GameStop.

01:49.132 --> 01:50.802
- It's absolute insanity.

01:50.837 --> 01:52.969
Even looking back, it
doesn't even make sense.

01:53.004 --> 01:56.247
- It is the story that
doesn't seem to die.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.678
- [Male Speaker] Literally,
I think the entire world
is talking about it.

01:58.713 --> 02:00.108
(speaking in foreign language)

02:00.143 --> 02:01.681
- It was like an out
of body experience.

02:01.716 --> 02:03.683
(speaking in foreign language)

02:03.718 --> 02:04.651
I can't really explain it.

02:04.686 --> 02:05.850
- [Announcer] Wall Street

02:05.885 --> 02:07.654
has been turned
upside down this week.

02:07.689 --> 02:09.953
- [Announcer] Shaken
by thousands of
small time investors

02:09.988 --> 02:11.658
taking on the big guys.

02:11.693 --> 02:13.264
- At one point,

02:13.299 --> 02:15.266
I'm just like there might be
a financial crisis developing.

02:15.301 --> 02:17.202
- It's like the villagers
storming the castle.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.764
- [Male Speaker]
Frenzied buying,

02:18.799 --> 02:20.832
the likes of which
we have never seen.

02:20.867 --> 02:22.207
- GameStop!
- I'll be quite honest,

02:22.242 --> 02:25.936
that whole week was
just a complete blur.

02:25.971 --> 02:29.610
- GameStop at the center of
this pretty extraordinary

02:29.645 --> 02:33.185
David and Goliath story
where individual investors

02:33.220 --> 02:36.111
are short squeezing some
pretty massive hedge funds.

02:36.146 --> 02:37.519
- [Male Speaker] We
have the most amazing

02:37.554 --> 02:39.455
short squeeze going on.

02:39.490 --> 02:41.556
- [Male Speaker] It seems
to be the short squeeze
of all short squeezes.

02:41.591 --> 02:43.052
- [Announcer] Forcing
those Wall Street giants

02:43.087 --> 02:44.658
to lose billions.

02:44.693 --> 02:47.628
- Oh, that's terrible, those
poor hedge fund managers.

02:47.663 --> 02:49.366
Now might be a
good time to invest

02:49.401 --> 02:52.237
in whoever manufacturers
the world's tiniest violins.

02:53.603 --> 02:56.208
- I was like, these
guys are wrong.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.836
It's kind of weird
saying that, right?

02:57.871 --> 03:00.905
Like, hey, these multi-billion
dollar hedge funds are wrong.

03:00.940 --> 03:03.545
This is gonna be the biggest
short squeeze in history.

03:03.580 --> 03:06.075
- That's pretty game-changing.

03:06.110 --> 03:11.080
My friends created a
revolution from their research.

03:11.522 --> 03:12.752
- Let's go, go!

03:12.787 --> 03:15.491
Let's go, you know what I mean?

03:15.526 --> 03:17.185
- People are coming
to us saying, hey,

03:17.220 --> 03:18.890
you're the reason I held on.

03:18.925 --> 03:21.497
Your research is what led
me to this opportunity.

03:21.532 --> 03:23.400
- [Male Speaker] Joining as
the original participants

03:23.435 --> 03:24.335
in the GameStop trade.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.997
- What's going on, everybody?

03:27.032 --> 03:29.538
Hopefully, you can
all hear me all right.

03:29.573 --> 03:31.100
I've never done one
of these before.

03:31.135 --> 03:33.102
We had the vision to see
what was going to happen

03:33.137 --> 03:34.576
before it happened.

03:34.611 --> 03:36.171
- What was it about it
that made you believe

03:36.206 --> 03:39.680
that there was a growth story
there that no one else saw?

03:39.715 --> 03:41.253
- I've been in the
thing for years.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.717
I've lived it, I've watched
the company's evolution.

03:43.752 --> 03:46.214
- Rod, you've been in GameStop

03:46.249 --> 03:49.184
waiting for this
moment since 2017.

03:49.219 --> 03:52.231
- It sure felt like I was
wrong for a long time.

03:54.565 --> 03:58.270
- To me, it just
represented an opportunity

03:58.305 --> 04:01.900
to prove to everybody that I
was right and they were wrong.

04:01.935 --> 04:05.409
(intense orchestral music)

04:24.760 --> 04:27.123
(cow mooing)

04:28.929 --> 04:31.963
- I grew up in
Mukwonago, Wisconsin.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.473
It's very rural, a lot of land.

04:37.938 --> 04:39.641
- Justin Dopierala.

04:39.676 --> 04:42.512
(audience applauding)

04:42.547 --> 04:44.976
- I was the first one of my
family to graduate from college.

04:46.485 --> 04:48.749
At one point, I contacted
several financial firms

04:48.784 --> 04:51.213
and no one would even
give me an internship.

04:52.821 --> 04:54.689
So I decided that,
you know what?

04:54.724 --> 04:55.756
I'm just gonna do it myself.

04:55.791 --> 04:57.923
I'm gonna go out on my own.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.365
I became DOMO
Capital Management.

05:01.698 --> 05:05.194
A lot of my clients were just
every day blue collar people,

05:05.229 --> 05:08.637
nurses, truck
drivers, electricians.

05:08.672 --> 05:11.508
(sparks crackling)

05:11.543 --> 05:15.072
(pensive electronic music)

05:19.815 --> 05:22.453
GameStop came up on
my screens in 2018,

05:22.488 --> 05:24.488
and it was clear to
me that the market

05:24.523 --> 05:27.392
had this huge misperception
about GameStop.

05:27.427 --> 05:29.218
- GameStop plunging after hours

05:29.253 --> 05:30.857
after a disappointing quarter.

05:30.892 --> 05:33.398
- GameStop, yes, you
heard me right, GameStop,

05:33.433 --> 05:35.895
that store that you haven't
been to in like a decade.

05:35.930 --> 05:37.226
- Yeah, GameStop,

05:37.261 --> 05:39.470
you know that money
losing video game store?

05:39.505 --> 05:42.297
- For years, this stock
has been absolutely hated

05:42.332 --> 05:44.233
because the whole
industry is moving online.

05:44.268 --> 05:46.543
- It's a dog shit company, okay?

05:46.578 --> 05:48.710
It's shocking that
they haven't filed

05:48.745 --> 05:50.448
for bankruptcy protection yet.

05:53.211 --> 05:54.815
- So in May of 2019,

05:54.850 --> 05:58.819
I wrote an article, GameStop,
time to use the Konami Code,

05:58.854 --> 06:02.218
a famous cheat that most
gamers know from Contra.

06:02.253 --> 06:03.527
- [Male Speaker]
Up, up, down, down,

06:03.562 --> 06:06.860
left, right, left,
right, B, A, start.

06:06.895 --> 06:08.026
30 lives.

06:11.394 --> 06:13.361
- I was really the
first one to come out

06:13.396 --> 06:16.034
and have a strong
conviction in GameStop.

06:27.311 --> 06:29.619
- Investing, it's a
combination of engineering,

06:29.654 --> 06:31.456
and I would say, art,

06:31.491 --> 06:34.118
even though that sounds a
little bit too pretentious.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.320
Originally, I'm from Russia.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.631
Russia is not a country

06:41.666 --> 06:44.095
where there was a
lot of opportunity.

06:44.130 --> 06:47.538
And just generally
speaking, of course,

06:47.573 --> 06:48.671
it is way better here.

06:53.678 --> 06:57.306
I'm not a financial
professional.

06:57.341 --> 07:00.485
My profession is really
I'm a software architect,

07:00.520 --> 07:01.915
but a few years ago,

07:01.950 --> 07:04.049
I got really interested
in investing.

07:04.084 --> 07:07.822
- So let's examine the structure
of American capitalism.

07:07.857 --> 07:12.464
- Investing has several
different layers
to it, if you will.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.664
- The first rule of
investment is don't lose.

07:14.699 --> 07:15.830
And the second
rule of investment

07:15.865 --> 07:17.469
is don't forget the first rule.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.471
- [Dmitriy] Frequently,
people rely on their emotions.

07:19.506 --> 07:20.901
- Which is terrible news

07:20.936 --> 07:23.772
for the company's only
stockholder, Homer Simpson.

07:23.807 --> 07:25.136
- Oh!

07:25.171 --> 07:26.511
- But you have to
be dispassionate

07:26.546 --> 07:27.809
if you are to make
money, of course.

07:27.844 --> 07:30.515
You don't want to become
emotionally attached.

07:33.344 --> 07:35.520
You have to be interested
in what you're doing,

07:35.555 --> 07:38.523
not just in it to make money.

07:38.558 --> 07:40.283
You have to really care.

07:41.528 --> 07:43.121
That makes you a
better investor.

07:44.894 --> 07:49.292
And one of my
investments was GameStop.

07:49.327 --> 07:51.833
- If you have GameStop
stock, sell it now.

07:51.868 --> 07:53.428
- You know, every
once in a while,

07:53.463 --> 07:54.869
I'll just poke my head
in there, check it out,

07:54.904 --> 07:57.036
be like, yeah, yeah, this
still looks like shit.

07:57.071 --> 07:58.774
- If you hate GameStop,

07:58.809 --> 08:00.776
well, you can just feel free
to give this video a like,

08:00.811 --> 08:01.975
share with your friends.

08:02.010 --> 08:03.438
- People were just
roasting the company.

08:03.473 --> 08:05.715
Hey, GameStop is tanking.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.651
Nobody goes to GameStop.

08:07.686 --> 08:09.048
Who goes to GameStop?

08:10.051 --> 08:13.591
(pensive orchestral music)

08:22.096 --> 08:25.328
I was born in
Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

08:25.363 --> 08:27.165
So my mom and my
dad are both Syrian.

08:29.070 --> 08:32.808
One thing that my father
told me all the time was,

08:32.843 --> 08:35.140
hey, you're never gonna
live a comfortable life

08:35.175 --> 08:37.648
doing a 9:00 to 5:00,
doing an office job.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.244
You need to learn how
to manage your money.

08:45.185 --> 08:47.592
When I was around 15,

08:47.627 --> 08:52.421
my father passed away
and I thought about life.

08:53.897 --> 08:57.096
And I realized he was prepping
me to take care of my family.

08:58.935 --> 09:02.101
So my mom has absolutely no idea

09:02.136 --> 09:04.906
that I drove up to
Alabama last night.

09:04.941 --> 09:06.908
I'm about to surprise
the hell out of her.

09:08.615 --> 09:12.551
(speaking in foreign language)

09:14.445 --> 09:15.686
Don't say that.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.622
I started getting
into misunderstood,

09:17.657 --> 09:20.053
underappreciated type companies

09:20.088 --> 09:21.791
that could potentially
make a comeback.

09:21.826 --> 09:24.189
Yo, when somebody tells
you not to do something,

09:24.224 --> 09:25.520
you do it.

09:25.555 --> 09:28.600
So I started getting
into GameStop

09:30.593 --> 09:33.737
and I started writing
about it on StockTwits.

09:33.772 --> 09:37.433
- It's like Twitter for
financial markets exclusively.

09:38.975 --> 09:40.007
- I was GMEshortsqueeze.

09:41.571 --> 09:43.142
I have a little logo
with a green arrow.

09:44.981 --> 09:47.784
This whole GameStop story

09:47.819 --> 09:51.084
started on Seeking
Alpha and StockTwits.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.628
I have a data
visualization background

09:58.093 --> 10:03.261
and my philosophy is a
picture can say 1,000 words.

10:04.594 --> 10:07.496
If you can put a small
graphic that gives insights,

10:07.531 --> 10:11.269
that can inspire people
to do more research.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.569
- [Male Speaker]
Screw this shit, man.

10:14.604 --> 10:16.505
GameStop frickin' sucks.

10:16.540 --> 10:17.979
Don't go there.

10:18.014 --> 10:21.719
(pensive orchestral music)

10:26.121 --> 10:27.626
- I wanted a sanity check.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.698
I wanted to understand,
what was I missing?

10:37.968 --> 10:41.838
I was a self-confessed
GameStop fanatic by then.

10:41.873 --> 10:43.840
I was reading every bit
of content I could scrape

10:43.875 --> 10:45.677
anywhere across the internet.

10:48.638 --> 10:50.011
- I first came across Rod

10:50.046 --> 10:52.541
when he reached out to
me through my website.

10:52.576 --> 10:54.785
He wasn't looking to
invest with DOMO Capital,

10:54.820 --> 10:57.513
but he just wanted to
talk about GameStop.

10:57.548 --> 10:58.646
- Exactly.

10:58.681 --> 11:00.791
He had an intake
form on his website.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.552
I said, I've read a lot of
your stories about GameStop.

11:03.587 --> 11:04.861
I'm an investor

11:04.896 --> 11:07.556
and I would love to have
a discussion with you.

11:07.591 --> 11:10.031
- Rod and I would
exchange texts.

11:10.066 --> 11:12.198
We've never met in person.

11:12.233 --> 11:16.004
For me personally, Rod
Alzmann was always Uberkikz.

11:16.039 --> 11:20.910
- That was my AOL instant
messenger name from fifth grade.

11:22.111 --> 11:23.539
I made it up because
I played soccer

11:24.674 --> 11:26.718
and 11 was my favorite number.

11:26.753 --> 11:30.381
And I've just used that as
kind of my username ever since.

11:32.759 --> 11:35.958
My job is in competitive
intelligence corporate strategy.

11:37.357 --> 11:38.994
At lunch at work for years,

11:39.029 --> 11:40.688
we'd be talking about stocks,

11:40.723 --> 11:44.868
and GameStop, for me, was
always the largest position.

11:44.903 --> 11:47.772
- They are the world's
greatest optimists, I guess.

11:47.807 --> 11:48.740
- Yes.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.236
Or they know something we don't.

11:50.271 --> 11:51.600
- My coworkers, they were like,

11:51.635 --> 11:53.602
"Why are you doing
this to yourself, Rod?

11:53.637 --> 11:55.571
Why are you still in GameStop?"

11:58.917 --> 12:00.576
- [Female Speaker]
Internet trolls are people

12:00.611 --> 12:02.710
lurking in cyberspace
who launch attacks.

12:02.745 --> 12:04.921
- They're these losers
who don't have a job

12:04.956 --> 12:07.715
and they're in the basement
of their parents' house.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.289
- [Male Speaker] They feed
off of negative reactions.

12:10.324 --> 12:14.194
- The majority of the
trolls would post,

12:14.229 --> 12:15.767
this is Blockbuster.

12:15.802 --> 12:18.594
- GameStop is a brick and
mortar video game retailer

12:18.629 --> 12:20.871
at a time when
people increasingly
download their games

12:20.906 --> 12:22.598
off the internet.

12:22.633 --> 12:24.237
- [Announcer] A lot of people
are buying their
video games online

12:24.272 --> 12:25.568
instead of going
into the stores.

12:25.603 --> 12:27.603
- Brick and mortar stores
have been under pressure

12:27.638 --> 12:28.813
for some time.

12:28.848 --> 12:29.913
- In a few weeks,
stores like this

12:29.948 --> 12:31.981
will simply be a
memory of Americana.

12:32.016 --> 12:33.884
- [Announcer] The company
filed for bankruptcy

12:33.919 --> 12:34.918
six months ago.

12:34.953 --> 12:35.787
- Blockbuster.

12:37.318 --> 12:39.219
- [Male Speaker] Is GameStop
the next Blockbuster?

12:39.254 --> 12:41.254
- This is the next Blockbuster.

12:41.289 --> 12:42.255
They're going out of business.

12:43.687 --> 12:45.225
- GameStop, it's a
company of the past.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.897
- Are they Blockbuster two?

12:46.932 --> 12:47.799
Hell yes.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.262
They're Blockbuster two, man,

12:49.297 --> 12:51.033
the much deadlier sequel.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.266
(merchandise crashing)

12:53.301 --> 12:56.071
- Hey, this is irrelevant
because the PS5

12:56.106 --> 12:57.974
and the Xbox series X
are coming out next year.

12:58.009 --> 13:00.273
- So let's talk about
our next console.

13:02.981 --> 13:04.607
- The biggest risk was
that the new consoles

13:04.642 --> 13:06.411
wouldn't have disk drives.

13:06.446 --> 13:07.918
- [Male Speaker] You know,
very few people are going

13:07.953 --> 13:09.986
and buying video games
in malls anymore.

13:10.021 --> 13:11.779
- If you ask any
10 to 15 year old,

13:11.814 --> 13:13.121
they're downloading
games, right?

13:13.156 --> 13:14.188
They're not going
to these stores.

13:14.223 --> 13:15.827
- If everything
goes all digital,

13:15.862 --> 13:17.994
why the hell would I
ever go into a GameStop?

13:18.029 --> 13:19.490
- [Justin] I had a thesis.

13:19.525 --> 13:22.427
I didn't think the new
consoles would be digital only.

13:22.462 --> 13:25.364
- [Dmitriy] And
Justin was correct.

13:25.399 --> 13:27.630
- I was digging
into the financials

13:27.665 --> 13:30.204
and all I got was made
fun of, all right?

13:30.239 --> 13:31.667
I'm telling you, it's not over.

13:31.702 --> 13:33.977
- Even if they were to
go bankrupt immediately,

13:35.838 --> 13:37.343
there was more money there

13:37.378 --> 13:39.642
than what the stock
was selling for.

13:39.677 --> 13:41.776
- The price had
gotten down below $4.

13:41.811 --> 13:43.712
It just made no sense.

13:43.747 --> 13:46.682
And if we're specifically
talking about video games,

13:46.717 --> 13:48.057
they are who you think of.

13:48.092 --> 13:49.784
Clearly, this brand is not dead.

13:49.819 --> 13:51.060
It's vibrant.

13:51.095 --> 13:53.194
And this cycle is about
to reinvigorate it.

13:55.264 --> 13:57.066
- It's like when you're
playing Texas Hold'em,

13:57.101 --> 13:59.332
you know if you
have a certain hand

13:59.367 --> 14:02.137
and you know you
have a lot of outs.

14:02.172 --> 14:05.239
And with GameStop,
there was so many outs.

14:12.842 --> 14:14.710
- Investing is
almost like a game.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.218
It's like a game

14:17.253 --> 14:20.749
where you are competing
against other people

14:20.784 --> 14:22.993
whom you don't know.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.193
I was really interested
who those people are

14:25.228 --> 14:26.689
on the other side of my trade.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.034
- There aren't too
many jobs, professions,

14:31.069 --> 14:34.829
or even inventions that would
make someone a billionaire,

14:34.864 --> 14:37.172
but hedge funds created
by industry pioneers

14:37.207 --> 14:40.076
such as Steven A.
Cohen did just that.

14:40.111 --> 14:41.869
- [Announcer] Cohen was
actually the inspiration

14:41.904 --> 14:43.838
for the fictitional
character Bobby Axelrod

14:43.873 --> 14:45.774
on the Showtime
drama, "Billions."

14:45.809 --> 14:48.414
- I am a monster.

14:48.449 --> 14:51.021
- It's been a big month
for Citadel's Ken Griffin

14:51.056 --> 14:52.220
in real estate,

14:52.255 --> 14:53.683
the hedge fund
manager purchasing

14:53.718 --> 14:55.586
the most expensive home
ever sold in the U.S.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.128
- [Announcer] Hedge funds

14:59.163 --> 15:00.888
use sophisticated
investment techniques

15:00.923 --> 15:04.199
that enable them to make money
when the markets are rising

15:04.234 --> 15:05.398
and falling.

15:05.433 --> 15:06.861
- The stock market's
just a rigged game

15:06.896 --> 15:09.105
where the top 1%
make out like bandits

15:09.140 --> 15:10.403
and regular people get hurt.

15:12.836 --> 15:15.210
- Justin mentioned
that some hedge funds

15:15.245 --> 15:17.872
were heavily short GameStop.

15:17.907 --> 15:19.313
- [Male Speaker] Hedge
fund managers bet money

15:19.348 --> 15:21.414
that a specific stock
will decline in value.

15:21.449 --> 15:22.811
That's called short selling.

15:22.846 --> 15:23.988
- [Female Speaker]
The trader bets

15:24.023 --> 15:25.781
that has stock
price will go down.

15:25.816 --> 15:27.222
And when it does,
they make money.

15:27.257 --> 15:30.093
But if it goes up, they
lose a lot of money.

15:30.128 --> 15:32.326
- [Male Speaker] There
are those big institutions

15:32.361 --> 15:34.966
and hedge funds that
love to short stocks,

15:35.001 --> 15:37.925
in other words, to bet on
their price collapsing.

15:37.960 --> 15:41.104
- Short sellers crash
companies and profit from that.

15:41.139 --> 15:46.142
- They go, uh-oh, that
company's not doing well,

15:47.013 --> 15:49.838
so I'm gonna make it do worse.

15:49.873 --> 15:54.150
- It's the joy and revelment
of seeing somebody else fail.

15:56.022 --> 15:59.122
- [Male Speaker] These are
nasty, ruthless motherfuckers

15:59.157 --> 16:01.454
who will stop at
nothing to make a buck.

16:03.623 --> 16:06.525
- Wall Street's been
manipulating the
market for years.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.856
This isn't new news.

16:07.891 --> 16:09.099
Like, it's been going on.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.265
They're gonna hurt
the little guy

16:10.300 --> 16:11.266
because that's what
always happens,

16:11.301 --> 16:12.828
they go after the little guy.

16:15.965 --> 16:20.341
I was staying at a job
that I was only staying at

16:20.376 --> 16:22.607
because of financial security.

16:22.642 --> 16:24.741
And it was eating my soul alive.

16:26.910 --> 16:31.583
I always had a passion for
being in the music industry.

16:33.422 --> 16:35.290
My parents were so
against the music business

16:35.325 --> 16:37.490
because it wasn't their
traditional lifestyle

16:37.525 --> 16:40.361
that they had planned for me.

16:40.396 --> 16:44.200
Straight away, I'd be
like this demon child.

16:45.665 --> 16:48.237
And then I finally just
had a breaking point,

16:48.272 --> 16:50.239
so I left my job.

16:52.342 --> 16:55.409
I actually got a tattoo
the day before I quit

16:55.444 --> 16:57.906
saying come as you are,
which is my favorite,

16:57.941 --> 17:00.084
one of my favorite
Nirvana lyrics.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.910
And it's my favorite
band of all time

17:01.945 --> 17:04.220
to remind me that I
wasn't gonna back out

17:04.255 --> 17:06.519
of going into his
office and quitting.

17:08.952 --> 17:12.063
I had no idea when I
was gonna work next,

17:12.098 --> 17:14.560
but I ultimately knew that
it was the right decision.

17:15.959 --> 17:18.201
I was in a lot of debt,

17:18.236 --> 17:20.995
but I took all of my savings

17:21.030 --> 17:23.536
and put it into
the stock market,

17:23.571 --> 17:25.406
and just kind of
hoped for the best.

17:28.114 --> 17:31.181
- So I've always been
like a casual investor,

17:31.216 --> 17:32.314
nothing serious.

17:36.155 --> 17:40.014
I wanted to invest in what
I knew, which was gaming.

17:40.049 --> 17:42.225
(cart whooshing)
- Hee hee!

17:42.260 --> 17:44.326
- My first job
was a game tester.

17:45.626 --> 17:46.559
- A, A!

17:47.496 --> 17:49.056
- I can fix you?

17:49.091 --> 17:49.892
- [Child] Yes!

17:49.927 --> 17:51.234
- I didn't know that.

17:51.269 --> 17:54.369
But then I took a
position as a game master,

17:54.404 --> 17:59.110
which was basically the god
of the world in EverQuest.

18:00.102 --> 18:02.036
(thunder clapping)

18:02.071 --> 18:03.477
When you work in the
video game industry,

18:03.512 --> 18:07.041
unfortunately, it
doesn't pay great.

18:07.076 --> 18:08.218
Ouch!

18:08.253 --> 18:09.648
So I ended up
moving away from it.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.651
I made it a new
year's resolution,

18:12.686 --> 18:14.224
I said, I'm gonna start
a YouTube channel.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.456
I'm doing this.

18:15.491 --> 18:16.754
What's going on, guys?

18:16.789 --> 18:19.130
Welcome to another
episode of Smash JT,

18:19.165 --> 18:20.428
- Smash!
- JT.

18:20.463 --> 18:21.726
- Thank you so
much for watching.

18:21.761 --> 18:23.398
And as always,
you stay smashing.

18:23.433 --> 18:24.267
You stay smashing.

18:24.302 --> 18:25.059
You stay smashing.

18:25.094 --> 18:26.093
You stay smashing.

18:26.128 --> 18:27.567
You stay smashing.

18:27.602 --> 18:30.603
GameStop was hated among
gamers, like hated.

18:30.638 --> 18:32.066
- Every time I go into GameStop,

18:32.101 --> 18:33.573
I'm like, who's buying
any of this shit?

18:33.608 --> 18:35.344
I'm betting against
this horrible company.

18:35.379 --> 18:37.346
- Hell, even I
trashed it sometimes.

18:37.381 --> 18:41.284
There are typos on the website.

18:41.319 --> 18:42.252
Yikes.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.079
But I saw a tweet from GameStop.

18:45.114 --> 18:47.356
- There are a few GameStops,

18:47.391 --> 18:50.018
particularly up in
Tulsa, Oklahoma,

18:50.053 --> 18:52.922
where they are starting
to change things around.

18:52.957 --> 18:56.497
- It got my brain
running wild, like whoa,

18:56.532 --> 18:58.092
what could happen
to this company

18:58.127 --> 19:00.501
that's been beaten
into the dirt?

19:00.536 --> 19:02.470
I bought stock in GameStop.

19:05.376 --> 19:08.212
So my initial
investment in GameStop

19:08.247 --> 19:13.349
was wholly based off
of, oh, they're trying.

19:13.384 --> 19:14.482
Maybe, I'm crazy.

19:14.517 --> 19:16.044
Maybe, I have
completely lost my mind,

19:17.223 --> 19:19.553
or maybe I'm just
onto something here.

19:19.588 --> 19:22.325
I saw so much potential,
so much possibility,

19:22.360 --> 19:24.492
and then some might say
the world started ending

19:24.527 --> 19:26.120
a month later.

19:26.155 --> 19:27.891
- Scientists in China
are trying to determine

19:27.926 --> 19:30.729
if a new virus strain
is responsible for
pneumonia outbreak

19:30.764 --> 19:32.401
in the city of Wuhan.

19:32.436 --> 19:34.667
- [Announcer] The CDC says
the mysterious coronavirus.

19:34.702 --> 19:36.636
- Coronavirus.
- Coronavirus.

19:36.671 --> 19:40.574
- The nation's retailers are
going to be absolutely hammered

19:40.609 --> 19:41.608
by the coronavirus.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.219
- COVID hit and things
changed quite a bit.

19:48.254 --> 19:51.387
- With millions of Americans
under lockdown right now,

19:51.422 --> 19:54.423
some cabin fever is
starting to set in.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.326
- Yeah, I thought you liked me.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.525
I never said I liked you.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.660
- I think (indistinct)
into Spider song.

20:00.695 --> 20:03.399
- We're done with that song.

20:03.434 --> 20:04.961
We are basically stuck at home.

20:06.195 --> 20:08.195
It's like Groundhog Day,

20:08.230 --> 20:10.604
but at least GameStop
was exciting.

20:11.640 --> 20:12.936
- [Rod] No social life.

20:14.104 --> 20:15.279
I was gaining weight.

20:16.777 --> 20:19.613
- The kids became virtual
and they're home every day.

20:19.648 --> 20:21.450
- [Announcer] The coronavirus
pandemic, as you know,

20:21.485 --> 20:24.178
is dramatically changing
our everyday lives.

20:24.213 --> 20:26.521
- Right about now, for many,
it means working from home.

20:26.556 --> 20:28.523
That is the new normal.

20:28.558 --> 20:32.461
- I was working at a tiny
kitchen table as my work set up

20:32.496 --> 20:35.530
with my girlfriend working
six feet away from me

20:35.565 --> 20:37.433
in this little living room space

20:37.468 --> 20:39.732
where we're both doing our jobs.

20:39.767 --> 20:44.374
- I had been living by myself
for a month and a half.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.738
I wasn't working.

20:45.773 --> 20:48.378
I felt like I didn't
have a purpose in life.

20:48.413 --> 20:51.546
So I went to New
Jersey for the summer

20:51.581 --> 20:53.416
to be with my parents.

20:53.451 --> 20:55.484
I surprised them.

20:55.519 --> 20:56.881
I was drunk shopping

20:56.916 --> 20:59.455
and I got delivered
to the wrong location.

20:59.490 --> 21:03.151
My dad thought I was the Amazon
delivery driver at first.

21:03.186 --> 21:06.462
- It should be delivered.

21:06.497 --> 21:07.925
She got her luggage.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.302
I just said my daughter's
on the thing inside.

21:11.337 --> 21:14.162
- I would wake up,
I would do yoga,

21:14.197 --> 21:16.637
and then I would start learning

21:16.672 --> 21:19.002
how to trade in
the stock market.

21:20.643 --> 21:21.774
It was a lot of Googling.

21:21.809 --> 21:23.314
Very basic.

21:23.349 --> 21:25.239
- [Announcer] The weapon of
choice for these new traders

21:25.274 --> 21:26.845
are platforms like Robinhood.

21:28.013 --> 21:29.518
- It feels like monopoly
money sometimes.

21:29.553 --> 21:31.586
It feels like it's
not real money.

21:31.621 --> 21:34.952
Five clicks and I buy a stock.

21:37.187 --> 21:38.021
- The Robinhood revolution.

21:38.056 --> 21:39.825
They used a terrific app

21:39.860 --> 21:44.533
and commission free trading to
attract 70 million investors.

21:44.568 --> 21:46.337
♪ Hallelujah ♪

21:46.372 --> 21:47.932
- Back in the day, you
had a call your broker.

21:47.967 --> 21:50.605
- (indistinct) Cola at
eight and a quarter.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.167
- Now, times have changed.

21:52.202 --> 21:54.873
- Today, we're lucky to
be joined by Vlad Tenev,

21:54.908 --> 21:57.711
who's the co-CEO of Robinhood.

21:57.746 --> 21:59.141
We're proud of the fact

21:59.176 --> 22:01.847
that we've enabled so
many younger investors

22:01.882 --> 22:04.685
and first time investors to
have access to the markets.

22:04.720 --> 22:07.050
- Joining us now is
Davey Day Trader himself.

22:07.085 --> 22:11.659
- Sports are gone, so
I've moved to day trading.

22:11.694 --> 22:13.287
- Barstool Sports
Founder, Dave Portnoy,

22:13.322 --> 22:16.598
took to the Robinhood app
and started a revolution.

22:17.931 --> 22:19.326
- From like where
my parents are from,

22:19.361 --> 22:21.801
it's a very conservative people.

22:21.836 --> 22:24.298
So investing, risking
money isn't really a thing

22:24.333 --> 22:26.542
that you're taught to do.

22:26.577 --> 22:28.236
You're taught hard work

22:28.271 --> 22:30.271
to get to where you
want to be in life.

22:31.549 --> 22:32.746
You know, I'm a college student,

22:32.781 --> 22:35.012
so right now, I don't
have money saved up.

22:36.015 --> 22:37.421
So I decided, okay,

22:37.456 --> 22:39.687
what's a good company to
park my money for a year

22:39.722 --> 22:42.393
that I know can at
least double or triple?

22:44.595 --> 22:46.089
I saw the name GameStop

22:46.124 --> 22:49.565
and it automatically
got my attention.

22:49.600 --> 22:51.963
(screaming)

22:53.604 --> 22:55.571
Was I getting ripped off
from GameStop sometimes?

22:55.606 --> 22:56.539
Yeah.

22:56.574 --> 22:58.002
- Say you have a game worth $50,

22:58.037 --> 22:59.707
well, we can take that
off your hands right now

22:59.742 --> 23:02.446
and give you $6 in store credit.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.844
- [Rigo] But I love GameStop,

23:04.879 --> 23:06.681
and that's why I
bought the stock.

23:06.716 --> 23:08.617
- [Female Speaker] GameStop,
which sells video games

23:08.652 --> 23:11.686
and consoles is not doing well.

23:11.721 --> 23:13.853
- GameStop had
certain things going

23:13.888 --> 23:15.217
which made it appear

23:15.252 --> 23:18.594
as it was doing worse
than it really was doing.

23:18.629 --> 23:21.256
- It's game over for hundreds
of GameStop locations.

23:21.291 --> 23:23.467
- Closing hundreds of stores.

23:23.502 --> 23:25.260
- That's pretty sad.

23:25.295 --> 23:27.394
- [Justin] It was publicized
as this negative thing.

23:27.429 --> 23:29.572
- At some point,
you're gonna be like,

23:29.607 --> 23:30.771
how are they still in business?

23:30.806 --> 23:32.542
- And it was so funny

23:32.577 --> 23:34.368
because we wanted
GameStop to close stores.

23:34.403 --> 23:36.370
- You don't need to have these
stores all over one another.

23:36.405 --> 23:38.306
They had over 6,000 stores.

23:38.341 --> 23:40.781
- And there's just no need to
have stores on every corner.

23:40.816 --> 23:43.718
- [Male Speaker]
May be game over
for major retailer GameStop.

23:43.753 --> 23:46.413
- That was a big disconnect
because on its face,

23:46.448 --> 23:48.052
if a company's
shuttering stores,

23:48.087 --> 23:49.284
that's a bad thing.

23:49.319 --> 23:52.320
And it wasn't in
GameStop's case.

23:52.355 --> 23:55.257
- I was like, hey, how can
I turn this into a graphic

23:55.292 --> 23:59.063
so other people will understand
what store closings mean.

23:59.098 --> 24:02.770
So I went, I scraped all
the locations for GameStop,

24:02.805 --> 24:05.839
and you're seeing more
GameStops out there

24:05.874 --> 24:07.478
than fast food companies.

24:07.513 --> 24:08.908
It doesn't make sense.

24:08.943 --> 24:11.306
There doesn't need to
be that many GameStops.

24:11.341 --> 24:13.011
- You're seeing investors flee

24:13.046 --> 24:14.441
because they're concerned

24:14.476 --> 24:15.948
if you don't have
people in your stores,

24:15.983 --> 24:17.785
you don't have cash
coming into the registers.

24:17.820 --> 24:20.788
Your short-term outlook
could get very ugly.

24:20.823 --> 24:21.987
- There was not a good thing

24:22.022 --> 24:24.451
to be seen online
about GameStop.

24:24.486 --> 24:29.390
- Smash JT, you're
so full of shit.

24:29.799 --> 24:31.535
- God!

24:31.570 --> 24:33.504
- [Male Speaker]
This guy is a madman.
He is a crazed lunatic.

24:33.539 --> 24:35.297
We've seen his videos

24:35.332 --> 24:37.772
of him walking around doing
his stupid GameStop videos.

24:37.807 --> 24:39.939
- That's what I've been
saying about GameStop

24:39.974 --> 24:41.644
since I started covering them.

24:41.679 --> 24:43.437
- [Male Speaker] Troll JT.

24:43.472 --> 24:45.714
- I will always be a gamer.

24:45.749 --> 24:48.442
- What a fuckin' weirdo.

24:48.477 --> 24:49.476
(laughing)

24:49.511 --> 24:50.785
- I remember thinking

24:50.820 --> 24:53.689
if I didn't make a
YouTube video on this,

24:53.724 --> 24:56.285
I would probably
sell out right now.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.957
I don't mean to be
turning this channel

24:57.992 --> 25:01.026
into like a
GameStop-centric channel.

25:01.061 --> 25:02.797
Damn it, I believe
in this company.

25:02.832 --> 25:04.733
I believe in the turnaround.

25:04.768 --> 25:07.571
And we don't know the
extent of this COVID thing.

25:07.606 --> 25:09.804
We don't know how
bad it's gonna be.

25:09.839 --> 25:13.335
I finally feel like GameStop
is onto something here.

25:15.042 --> 25:18.142
I need to find someone

25:18.177 --> 25:22.080
to reinforce my feelings
on this company.

25:23.721 --> 25:26.656
So I started looking online,

25:26.691 --> 25:29.923
but most weren't covering
it in a positive light

25:29.958 --> 25:31.254
except Roaring Kitty.

25:31.289 --> 25:32.420
- Hey, what's up, everybody?

25:32.455 --> 25:33.993
Welcome to Roaring Kitty.

25:34.028 --> 25:35.764
This channel revolves
around live streams

25:35.799 --> 25:37.931
where I share my daily
routine of tracking stocks,

25:37.966 --> 25:39.361
performing investment research,

25:39.396 --> 25:42.199
and a whole bunch of
boring stuff like that.

25:42.234 --> 25:43.431
- It's this dude
with a headband,

25:43.466 --> 25:44.839
has a beer in his hand,

25:44.874 --> 25:49.173
and he's like GameStop,
guys, GameStop.

25:49.208 --> 25:50.845
Cheers.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.508
- Oh, JT Smash, JT Smash.

25:54.543 --> 25:56.411
Shout out to JT Smash.

25:56.446 --> 26:01.515
JT, terrific, terrific video
that you uploaded on GameStop.

26:01.550 --> 26:02.923
- So I was just
like, man, finally,

26:02.958 --> 26:05.519
someone as crazy as me.

26:05.554 --> 26:07.796
- We would all join
Monday, Wednesday,

26:07.831 --> 26:09.600
Friday night at
7:00 p.m. Eastern.

26:09.635 --> 26:11.899
- His streams would be like
six, seven, eight hours.

26:11.934 --> 26:14.935
- I mean, there was
like 10, 15, 20 people.

26:14.970 --> 26:16.640
- Justin, cheers,
cheers, cheers.

26:16.675 --> 26:18.004
Great week for GameStop indeed.

26:19.601 --> 26:20.534
- I was like, no way!

26:20.569 --> 26:21.568
He's like, Justin.

26:21.603 --> 26:23.746
He's like, hey, cheers.

26:23.781 --> 26:26.045
- So this is DOMO Capital
Management's website here.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.046
You want to check this out.

26:27.081 --> 26:28.443
And then you can see,

26:28.478 --> 26:31.787
look at the returns of
a long ass time too.

26:31.822 --> 26:33.822
Dmitriy had some solid
articles out there too.

26:33.857 --> 26:34.955
There was a whole bunch of them.

26:34.990 --> 26:36.583
- He was like, oh,
cheers, Dmitriy!

26:36.618 --> 26:37.584
- Cheers to all y'all.

26:37.619 --> 26:38.893
- This is Dmitriy.

26:38.928 --> 26:40.257
- Cheers, cheers!

26:40.292 --> 26:41.093
Cheers!

26:41.128 --> 26:41.995
Cheers, everybody.

26:42.030 --> 26:42.798
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

26:42.833 --> 26:43.766
Cheers, everybody.

26:43.801 --> 26:44.899
We gotta have fun with it here.

26:44.934 --> 26:46.494
- Roaring Kitty
would shout me out.

26:46.529 --> 26:48.463
- Jenn says, catching
up on the comments

26:48.498 --> 26:50.234
are gonna be rough today.

26:50.269 --> 26:52.434
I know, I gotta keep
going, I gotta keep going.
My bad, my bad.

26:52.469 --> 26:54.810
- And frankly, this obsession
with cats was kind of funny.

26:55.879 --> 26:58.572
(cat meowing)

26:58.607 --> 27:00.112
- I had explained my
mom and dad about,

27:00.147 --> 27:01.377
hey, we're talking
about GameStop.

27:04.954 --> 27:06.756
My dad thought he was crazy.

27:06.791 --> 27:07.790
- Let me just dip,

27:07.825 --> 27:09.517
just one dip, just
one quick dip.

27:12.126 --> 27:15.798
- Roaring Kitty's stream
almost was like a support group

27:15.833 --> 27:18.966
and it was just like a
place where we'd go and just
like vent to each other.

27:19.001 --> 27:20.198
- This is sick.

27:20.233 --> 27:22.596
We've got the usual
crew on a Friday,

27:22.631 --> 27:25.038
on an exciting,
fun Friday night.

27:25.073 --> 27:27.469
- [Rod] People just
hung out, you know?

27:30.749 --> 27:32.111
- I made every single stream.

27:32.146 --> 27:33.684
I planned my night around it.

27:33.719 --> 27:34.608
It was crazy.

27:34.643 --> 27:35.686
- 'Cause I want people to share.

27:35.721 --> 27:36.951
We're doing research,

27:36.986 --> 27:38.183
we're doing research
collectively here.

27:39.318 --> 27:40.988
- Well, you can't really
go out on a Monday,

27:41.023 --> 27:42.616
Wednesday, or Friday
night anymore,

27:42.651 --> 27:44.189
so I'm stuck inside.

27:44.224 --> 27:46.653
Let me jump on the
Roaring Kitty stream

27:46.688 --> 27:48.798
and talk about GameStop.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.228
What else is there to do?

27:50.263 --> 27:51.702
- This is my thesis.

27:51.737 --> 27:53.704
You're welcome to
tear it to shreds.

27:53.739 --> 27:54.628
Feel free.

27:54.663 --> 27:55.662
I encourage you to, please.

27:55.697 --> 27:57.807
- You know, it's
like cotton candy.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.634
We have this thesis,
this cotton candy stick,

28:00.669 --> 28:03.208
and then we would
just all add to it.

28:03.243 --> 28:05.639
- We're all drinking
from the punchbowl

28:05.674 --> 28:08.675
in the cult of this is GameStop.

28:08.710 --> 28:09.676
We're all crazy.

28:09.711 --> 28:11.546
We all know it,

28:11.581 --> 28:14.087
but we're all accepting that
because maybe we're not.

28:14.122 --> 28:15.682
- Oh jeez.

28:15.717 --> 28:18.421
Shift command T to open
up a tab you just closed.

28:18.456 --> 28:20.830
(rhythmic drumming music)
(cats meowing)

28:20.865 --> 28:24.262
- Roaring Kitty had
this extensive "Star
Wars-esque" intro

28:24.297 --> 28:27.232
where he said, don't take
me for financial advice.

28:27.267 --> 28:28.662
And that fascinated me

28:28.697 --> 28:30.906
because this guy was
streaming to like 10 people.

28:32.734 --> 28:34.140
- I'm taking a video of you.

28:43.712 --> 28:45.250
- [Female Speaker]
Joseph Fonicello!

28:45.285 --> 28:46.724
- I grew up in a small
town in Connecticut.

28:48.321 --> 28:49.221
- [Female Speaker] Joseph.

28:49.256 --> 28:50.618
- My parents owned a farm.

28:51.753 --> 28:55.095
- Joe's parents are
very, very traditional.

28:55.130 --> 28:58.032
Think 1920's farmer.

28:58.067 --> 28:59.231
- Still to this day,

28:59.266 --> 29:00.529
if my parents have
to read their emails,

29:00.564 --> 29:02.102
I gotta help them out.

29:02.137 --> 29:04.632
- Joe's dad is the type
of guy who gets mad

29:04.667 --> 29:07.371
if a package comes in
with Joe's name on it.

29:07.406 --> 29:10.275
Like, why are you ordering
things on the internet?

29:10.310 --> 29:13.443
- [Joe] When I was in
middle-school, I bought Bitcoin.
- Bitcoin.

29:15.183 --> 29:17.150
- And that was kind of
my first investment.

29:17.185 --> 29:19.889
- [Announcer] Digital
money called Bitcoin.

29:19.924 --> 29:23.288
- The kid bought Bitcoin when
he was 12 or 13 years old.

29:23.323 --> 29:27.259
I mean, and he still has it.

29:27.294 --> 29:29.624
- And then when I turned 18,

29:29.659 --> 29:31.659
I decided to divert
from crypto a bit

29:31.694 --> 29:33.595
into the real stock market.

29:36.798 --> 29:39.304
- So, we have this van.

29:40.373 --> 29:41.504
- It's become our home.

29:45.708 --> 29:48.819
We took the opportunity
COVID granted us to travel.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.183
Let me just put my mask on.

29:52.286 --> 29:53.615
We figured, what
are we gonna do,

29:53.650 --> 29:56.090
stay locked in our
homes doing Zoom calls?

29:56.125 --> 29:58.026
No, we can do Zoom
with a hotspot.

29:59.788 --> 30:02.833
And it wasn't until Abbe and
I lived on the road in the van

30:02.868 --> 30:04.296
when I started to
think of Reddit

30:04.331 --> 30:06.936
more as a place for
investment opportunities.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.335
- [Male Speaker] Now, if you've
never heard of reddit.com,

30:10.370 --> 30:13.800
it was nicknamed the front
page of the internet.

30:13.835 --> 30:16.176
- There came this
point in our trip

30:16.211 --> 30:18.882
where he was just totally
absorbed in something,

30:18.917 --> 30:21.709
like, absolutely non-stop.

30:21.744 --> 30:24.855
Well, he had just discovered
the GameStop thesis

30:24.890 --> 30:26.219
on Wall Street Bets.

30:28.993 --> 30:30.894
♪ Diamond Hands ♪

30:30.929 --> 30:33.787
(upbeat electronic music)

30:33.822 --> 30:35.459
- I would go to Wall Street Bets

30:35.494 --> 30:38.792
to look at funny
memes and videos.

30:38.827 --> 30:41.905
(upbeat electronic music)

30:41.940 --> 30:45.073
- The community is largely guys.

30:45.108 --> 30:48.571
(upbeat electronic music)

30:48.606 --> 30:50.177
Everybody's very broey.

30:50.212 --> 30:52.179
It feels like it's a frat house.

30:52.214 --> 30:54.313
- [Male Speaker] Most stocks
that are in an uptrend

30:54.348 --> 30:55.314
go like this.

30:55.349 --> 30:56.986
- The Wall Street bets community

30:57.021 --> 30:59.714
calls themselves degenerates.

30:59.749 --> 31:01.320
- Hello, my fellow degenerates.

31:01.355 --> 31:03.421
- [Male Speaker] The
price is wrong, bitch.

31:04.787 --> 31:06.325
- [Male Speaker] Stonks.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.822
- It's like a casino,
Wall Street Bets.

31:08.857 --> 31:10.065
Guys are saying, hey, you guys,

31:10.100 --> 31:12.067
I think this stock can
like double, triple.

31:12.102 --> 31:13.827
Buy some call options on this.

31:13.862 --> 31:16.764
- They're options, but really
not worth talking about today.

31:16.799 --> 31:19.437
The important point is that--
- You can make a lot of
money and get rich quick.

31:19.472 --> 31:21.043
- [Male Speaker] High
risk, high reward.

31:21.078 --> 31:22.506
- You're in for a wild ride.

31:22.541 --> 31:25.916
Very volatile, big
highs, big lows.

31:25.951 --> 31:28.842
- When Wall Street Bets
really became mainstream,

31:28.877 --> 31:31.416
you saw a shift from
the word autist to ape.

31:31.451 --> 31:34.254
- [Male Speaker] If you think
you might be autistic enough
to hang out with us,

31:34.289 --> 31:35.717
head on over to Wall
Street Bets on Reddit.

31:35.752 --> 31:37.961
- 'Cause they felt like
they were like autistic kids

31:37.996 --> 31:40.128
living in their basements of
their parents' house, you know,

31:40.163 --> 31:43.395
eating chicken tendies and
making stupid decisions,

31:43.430 --> 31:45.133
investing in stupid stocks.

31:45.168 --> 31:46.937
- [Male Speaker] The infamous
Wall Street Bets user

31:46.972 --> 31:48.367
who posted a live
screen recording

31:48.402 --> 31:50.974
showing him lose $50,000
in just a few minutes.

31:54.903 --> 31:57.376
- People just spewing
memes, and gifs,

31:57.411 --> 32:01.952
and I like to
shitpost personally,

32:01.987 --> 32:06.550
so it was a nice platform
for me to just do that.

32:06.585 --> 32:08.717
- [Jenn] The Wall Street
Bets lingo is diamond hands.

32:08.752 --> 32:10.389
You hold it, you don't let go.

32:10.424 --> 32:14.228
- Diamond hands means that
you never sell a stock,

32:14.263 --> 32:15.966
even if it goes down.

32:16.001 --> 32:17.099
- [Male Speaker] I live in a car

32:17.134 --> 32:19.101
and I'm diamond
hands to the moon.

32:19.136 --> 32:22.302
- Paper hands means that you
sell when a stock goes down.

32:24.867 --> 32:26.174
You've got tendies.

32:26.209 --> 32:27.472
That means profits.

32:29.509 --> 32:31.014
(laughing)

32:31.049 --> 32:33.313
YOLO means that you're
gonna risk money

32:33.348 --> 32:35.546
and there's a good chance
it's not gonna come back.

32:41.488 --> 32:45.259
- Wall Street Bets
hated GameStop.

32:45.294 --> 32:46.953
- [Male Speaker] I was
banned from Wall Street Bets.

32:46.988 --> 32:49.098
- [Farris] I got banned from
posting on Wall Street Bets.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.594
I haven't been blocked by anyone

32:50.629 --> 32:51.793
other than Wall Street Bets.

32:53.863 --> 32:56.864
- Farris tried to post
on Wall Street Bets

32:56.899 --> 32:58.371
and got laughed at,

32:58.406 --> 33:01.374
wasn't allowed to post
about GameStop because,

33:01.409 --> 33:02.507
you know, it's GameStop.

33:02.542 --> 33:04.344
It's going bankrupt, of course.

33:05.512 --> 33:08.810
- They weren't allowing
any posts on GameStop,

33:10.055 --> 33:11.615
which is funny

33:11.650 --> 33:13.089
because they were allowing
people to roast GameStop.

33:23.563 --> 33:24.892
- People were only
following GameStop

33:24.927 --> 33:28.071
because DeepFuckingValue,
the Reddit user,

33:28.106 --> 33:30.535
posted his position.

33:32.671 --> 33:35.309
- He YOLO'd his life
savings, it seemed like,

33:35.344 --> 33:37.905
into calls on GameStop.

33:37.940 --> 33:40.545
- [Male Speaker] YOLO,
you only live once.

33:48.357 --> 33:49.389
- Everyone on Wall Street Bets

33:49.424 --> 33:51.193
thought DeepFuckingValue
was crazy.

33:51.228 --> 33:52.491
- Everyone made fun of him.

33:52.526 --> 33:54.020
- People were
saying, he's an idiot

33:54.055 --> 33:56.066
and he's gonna
lose all his money.

33:58.059 --> 33:59.927
- My dad had been
trying to get me

33:59.962 --> 34:03.271
to go see a financial
advisor for years,

34:03.306 --> 34:05.999
and it's his financial advisor,

34:06.034 --> 34:07.572
so he's like telling me to sell

34:07.607 --> 34:09.937
because GameStop's
business model sucks

34:09.972 --> 34:11.345
and he doesn't like the company.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.116
And I was like, no, no, no.

34:13.151 --> 34:14.546
You're not gonna want to listen

34:14.581 --> 34:16.548
to why I think that
GameStop's a good investment,

34:16.583 --> 34:18.011
but like I'm only here

34:18.046 --> 34:20.519
because my dad told me I
had to be here to meet you,

34:20.554 --> 34:22.125
and so we're just
gonna leave it at that,

34:22.160 --> 34:24.259
but I'm not selling
my GameStop shares.

34:28.397 --> 34:30.595
- I definitely second
guessed myself plenty,

34:31.961 --> 34:34.632
but I think we were
very, very thoughtful

34:34.667 --> 34:35.897
in how we approached it.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.639
- I think if you take the
best of amateur investors,

34:41.674 --> 34:46.413
that content could be way
better than what you see

34:46.448 --> 34:49.119
with Wall Street
research analyst reports.

34:53.983 --> 34:57.050
- No one person can do
all of the research,

34:57.085 --> 34:59.789
so everybody in my group
had something to offer.

35:01.122 --> 35:04.057
We weren't just alone wolf
investing in the stock market,

35:04.092 --> 35:05.597
like how normal Wall Street is.

35:05.632 --> 35:06.796
We were all in it together.

35:09.097 --> 35:11.603
- Yeah, GameStop definitely
became an obsession.

35:14.212 --> 35:17.213
As I invested in GameStop, I
frequented the stores often.

35:19.547 --> 35:21.008
- Why are we at GameStop?

35:22.220 --> 35:23.450
- I would go and buy Chipotle

35:23.485 --> 35:25.518
and I'd sit in the
GameStop parking lot.

35:25.553 --> 35:27.652
You guys ready to
go to GameStop?

35:27.687 --> 35:29.115
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:29.150 --> 35:30.424
- I was probably sitting
the GameStop parking lot

35:30.459 --> 35:32.162
at least once a week.

35:32.197 --> 35:33.823
(sneezing)
God bless you.

35:44.209 --> 35:47.309
- I went to GameStop all
the time when I was a kid.

35:47.344 --> 35:50.444
And I understood despite
all the good memories,

35:50.479 --> 35:52.314
why it ended up being
a hated company.

35:52.349 --> 35:55.350
- [Male Speaker] It is
miserable to shop at GameStop.

35:55.385 --> 35:57.319
- It's a horrible
customer experience.

35:57.354 --> 36:00.520
So I thought to myself,
if they redeem themselves,

36:00.555 --> 36:03.424
there could be tremendous
reward potential here.

36:05.186 --> 36:06.559
- I was like, okay,

36:06.594 --> 36:08.363
this is starting to
get really interesting.

36:08.398 --> 36:09.826
They were trying to make changes

36:09.861 --> 36:12.433
so that they could build
their company back up again.

36:13.832 --> 36:15.161
- The video game
business is booming

36:15.196 --> 36:17.273
as Americans spend
more time at home.

36:19.167 --> 36:20.738
- Gaming interest
has skyrocketed

36:20.773 --> 36:22.003
as a result of the pandemic.

36:22.038 --> 36:24.137
- The gaming industry
is flourishing.

36:24.172 --> 36:27.074
- More people are gaming
now than pre-pandemic.

36:27.109 --> 36:29.846
- Yeah, that's right, and
it's largely due to boredom.

36:32.213 --> 36:36.259
- And still, I felt like the
stock price was being subdued.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.153
I can't help but think

36:40.188 --> 36:44.157
that there's some sort of
higher power intervening,

36:44.192 --> 36:46.467
saying, keep this
price down low.

36:50.198 --> 36:53.067
- There was a very
actively involved campaign

36:53.102 --> 36:54.673
on behalf of those who
were short the stock

36:54.708 --> 36:57.203
to hammer the price,

36:57.238 --> 37:00.877
bots spamming negative messages
and negative sentiment.

37:02.144 --> 37:03.847
- If you start seeing
that over, and over,

37:03.882 --> 37:05.354
and over, and over again,

37:05.389 --> 37:07.620
it makes you think
there's someone

37:07.655 --> 37:11.756
that has a vested interest
in forgetting GameStop.

37:13.892 --> 37:15.727
- [Male Speaker] Here's what
makes the hedge fund managers

37:15.762 --> 37:17.190
different from you.

37:17.225 --> 37:18.697
They have a lot
more power than you.

37:18.732 --> 37:19.962
They control the game.

37:19.997 --> 37:21.865
- [Male Speaker] Like
Maplelane Capital.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.098
- [Announcer] D1 now
manages over $20 billion.

37:26.267 --> 37:28.278
- [Female Speaker] Gabe
Plotkin formed his own firm,

37:28.313 --> 37:29.543
Melvin Capital Management.

37:29.578 --> 37:30.940
- [Male Speaker] Gabe Plotkin,

37:30.975 --> 37:33.283
who manages billions
of dollars of assets,

37:33.318 --> 37:35.714
he was the top trader
for Steve Cohen's fund.

37:35.749 --> 37:37.386
- [Female Speaker]
What does Gabe know

37:37.421 --> 37:39.553
that the rest of
Wall Street doesn't?

37:39.588 --> 37:41.214
- I think overall in society,

37:41.249 --> 37:44.294
there is this thought
that hedge funds

37:44.329 --> 37:47.220
have some kind of
special insight

37:47.255 --> 37:49.860
or better knowledge
and understanding.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.369
I was not necessarily
of that view,

37:54.372 --> 37:57.131
but I wanted to know
what they were thinking.

37:58.475 --> 38:00.167
Why are they shorting GameStop?

38:01.874 --> 38:05.172
(upbeat whimsical music)

38:10.212 --> 38:13.587
- Great short sellers
don't deal in gray areas.

38:13.622 --> 38:14.819
They deal in black and white.

38:16.724 --> 38:18.526
I never shorted a stock

38:18.561 --> 38:20.792
that I wasn't certain
was going to zero.

38:24.226 --> 38:26.259
- Tom Barton has a reputation

38:26.294 --> 38:28.404
and a history of
selling stocks short.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.671
- It's a lot of math,

38:31.706 --> 38:33.299
a lot of adding and
a lot of subtracting.

38:33.334 --> 38:36.005
- It was a really good time to
be a short seller, the '80s.

38:37.844 --> 38:39.305
It was a really good time.

38:39.340 --> 38:42.275
(people yelling)

38:42.310 --> 38:44.519
We would short stocks
to make a living

38:44.554 --> 38:47.390
because it's a better
place to put your money.

38:47.425 --> 38:48.853
- [Male Speaker]
Hedge funds gang up

38:48.888 --> 38:51.724
and literally will short
a stock out of business.

38:51.759 --> 38:53.825
- Two and eights sold,
two times at six.

38:58.865 --> 39:02.570
- Well, GameStop I'd heard
about because I'm a Dallas guy,

39:02.605 --> 39:04.000
it's a Dallas company.

39:04.035 --> 39:05.606
- [Announcer] A
touchdown, Dallas!

39:06.576 --> 39:09.379
- You gotta be a man
to play in my league.

39:09.414 --> 39:11.810
- When somebody calls me and
tells me (indistinct) nothing

39:11.845 --> 39:14.483
and the short
position's outrageous,

39:14.518 --> 39:15.550
two lights go on.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.215
- At this point, I would
say GameStop is over.

39:22.383 --> 39:24.592
- There was no chance it
was gonna go bankrupt.

39:24.627 --> 39:26.352
Zero.

39:26.387 --> 39:27.353
- GameStop is super,

39:27.388 --> 39:29.399
it's so nice to be there.

39:29.434 --> 39:31.896
- I wouldn't be shorting
this in a million years.

39:33.031 --> 39:34.602
- It was good seeing

39:34.637 --> 39:38.364
that there was a professional
short seller out there

39:38.399 --> 39:41.268
that's saying that these
short sellers are dumb.

39:46.044 --> 39:49.452
- Frankly, I was short
Tesla for a little bit.

39:49.487 --> 39:50.882
- [Male Speaker]
Tesla's wild ride

39:50.917 --> 39:53.115
has left many of the analyst
community in the dust.

39:54.822 --> 39:57.020
- [Dmitriy] So I
know what it's like
to be on the other side of it.

39:57.055 --> 40:00.430
- If you bet against
Tesla, you shorted.

40:00.465 --> 40:03.290
A lot of people have done
that and lost their shirts.

40:03.325 --> 40:07.294
- Tesla has listed quote
limited edition short shorts

40:07.329 --> 40:08.636
for sale on its website,

40:08.671 --> 40:10.165
mocking short sellers.

40:11.575 --> 40:14.070
- [Male Speaker] You guys
remember what happened at Tesla,
the short shorts?

40:15.436 --> 40:17.744
- You learn your best
lessons the hard way.

40:20.617 --> 40:24.278
And those are the
lessons you really absorb

40:26.689 --> 40:28.315
when it hurts.

40:28.350 --> 40:30.625
- People sometimes get
carried away with our stock,

40:30.660 --> 40:32.253
you know?

40:32.288 --> 40:35.091
- I still believe that Tesla
is structurally unprofitable.

40:36.600 --> 40:41.328
The lesson was, you can be
right in the underlying issue,

40:42.507 --> 40:43.935
but be wrong in the
ultimate outcome.

40:43.970 --> 40:45.970
- I just can't believe
this fricking stock.

40:46.005 --> 40:47.675
It's insane.

40:47.710 --> 40:52.009
- But the more local sort of
lesson is don't short stocks.

40:54.442 --> 40:57.410
- This is a nightmare
for short sellers.

40:57.445 --> 41:01.315
This morning, we got news
that Ryan Cohen of chewy.com

41:01.350 --> 41:05.418
has a 12.9% stake
in the company now.

41:05.453 --> 41:08.421
- This guy, Ryan Cohen,
chewy.com founder,

41:08.456 --> 41:10.632
he just bought a lot
of shares of GameStop.

41:11.701 --> 41:12.865
What is happening?

41:14.000 --> 41:17.364
- When Ryan Cohen popped
up in late August,

41:17.399 --> 41:18.706
that was fate.

41:18.741 --> 41:20.367
- I am joined now by the founder

41:20.402 --> 41:22.941
and former CEO of
Chewy, Ryan Cohen.

41:22.976 --> 41:24.514
Ryan, thanks so much
for being with us.

41:24.549 --> 41:25.713
- Thank you for having me.

41:25.748 --> 41:27.440
- Honestly, I didn't
know who he was.

41:27.475 --> 41:28.848
- I didn't know who
he was at first.

41:28.883 --> 41:30.784
- Well, I didn't know
that much about him.

41:30.819 --> 41:33.523
- The phenomenally successful
online pet food retailer.

41:33.558 --> 41:34.953
- I'm figuring out what's next

41:34.988 --> 41:37.384
and maybe I'll start
another business.
Who knows?

41:40.928 --> 41:45.062
- I think I had a weapon
that nobody else had

41:45.097 --> 41:46.833
because I worked for Chewy.

41:46.868 --> 41:48.868
- I love shopping for
my pets at chewy.com

41:48.903 --> 41:50.496
because I know I'll
be saving money.

41:50.531 --> 41:52.674
- Once customers shop at Chewy,

41:52.709 --> 41:53.906
they continue shopping at Chewy

41:53.941 --> 41:55.644
and they tell all their
friends and family

41:55.679 --> 41:57.503
about this incredible
experience.

41:57.538 --> 42:01.584
- Chewy is really a perfection
of taking something local

42:01.619 --> 42:04.477
and making it successful
in e-commerce.

42:04.512 --> 42:06.149
- [Female Speaker] Consumers
spend a lot of money

42:06.184 --> 42:07.689
on their pets.

42:07.724 --> 42:11.121
- The business model of GameStop
is very similar to Chewy.

42:12.520 --> 42:17.127
Gaming is just as a
memorable type experience

42:18.031 --> 42:19.866
as having a pet, in my opinion.

42:21.606 --> 42:23.837
I was like, all right, this
is Chewification at GameStop.

42:23.872 --> 42:26.169
Ryan is getting ready
to turn GameStop

42:26.204 --> 42:27.676
into the Chewy of gaming.

42:27.711 --> 42:28.908
Boom, we got something.

42:28.943 --> 42:31.207
GameStop could be
the next big stock.

42:31.242 --> 42:33.407
- You know, anybody could
sell physical things.

42:33.442 --> 42:34.507
- Thanks for calling GameStop

42:34.542 --> 42:35.717
where we buy and
sell used games.

42:35.752 --> 42:36.916
This is Steven,
how may I help you?

42:36.951 --> 42:38.588
- There's nothing
unique about GameStop.

42:38.623 --> 42:40.887
- Thank you for calling GameStop
where we buy and
sell used games.

42:40.922 --> 42:43.692
- The unique thing has to be
the way that the customer walks
away from that interaction.

42:43.727 --> 42:44.957
- At the end of the day,

42:44.992 --> 42:46.629
we just happen to
sell pet products.

42:46.664 --> 42:47.696
I think we would've
been successful,

42:47.731 --> 42:48.928
frankly, in any category.

42:50.492 --> 42:51.733
- Something big's
going on a GameStop.

42:51.768 --> 42:54.637
Their stock price
absolutely exploded.

42:54.672 --> 42:56.463
It's on fire quite literally.

42:56.498 --> 43:00.434
So Ryan Cohen, Ryan
Cohen, this is the guy.

43:00.469 --> 43:02.645
He's kind of attractive.

43:02.680 --> 43:06.649
This guy is going to make
a change at GameStop.

43:06.684 --> 43:07.914
- Now, if you buy
the stock here,

43:07.949 --> 43:09.542
you're betting that
Ryan Cohen's plan

43:09.577 --> 43:11.082
will be wildly successful,

43:11.117 --> 43:12.622
which seems like a stretch

43:12.657 --> 43:16.054
given that we don't even
know what the plan is yet.

43:16.089 --> 43:17.583
- Ryan Cohen and I connected

43:17.618 --> 43:21.125
and we ended up having a
one-on-one Zoom meeting.

43:21.160 --> 43:23.732
He literally just peppered
me with questions.

43:23.767 --> 43:24.832
What do you see in GameStop?

43:24.867 --> 43:25.734
What about this?

43:25.769 --> 43:26.900
Isn't this a concern?

43:26.935 --> 43:28.495
So you could just see that

43:28.530 --> 43:30.805
he's just looking to
confirm his thesis.

43:30.840 --> 43:33.841
- At first, I thought he
was acquiring GameStop

43:33.876 --> 43:36.569
maybe because he thought
it was undervalued,

43:36.604 --> 43:39.506
but then he kept
accumulating more and more

43:39.541 --> 43:41.849
and it was getting more
and more interesting.

43:41.884 --> 43:44.181
- News flash to all
these GameStop investors,

43:44.216 --> 43:45.479
GameStop is not Chewy.

43:45.514 --> 43:47.657
They do not serve
products to adorable,

43:47.692 --> 43:49.186
cute puppies and cats.

43:49.221 --> 43:51.287
Wake up, GameStop investors.
This is absurd.

43:52.554 --> 43:55.797
- When Ryan Cohen
became part of GameStop,

43:55.832 --> 43:57.865
the stock was
insanely over shorted.

43:57.900 --> 44:02.001
- Right now, an astounding
144% of the GameStop shares

44:02.036 --> 44:03.530
have been sold short.

44:03.565 --> 44:05.631
- Honestly, I've
never seen that.

44:05.666 --> 44:06.841
And I picked up the phone

44:06.876 --> 44:08.502
and called all my
short-selling buddies.

44:08.537 --> 44:09.536
I said, you ever seen this?

44:09.571 --> 44:10.977
They go, no, we've
never seen this.

44:11.012 --> 44:13.881
We've never seen 100%
of these so-called

44:13.916 --> 44:15.179
outstanding shares short.

44:15.214 --> 44:16.147
Never seen it.

44:17.051 --> 44:19.854
It was spring loaded to go up.

44:19.889 --> 44:21.790
And that's when I
looked at it and I said,

44:21.825 --> 44:24.694
oh, this is gonna
be a real problem

44:24.729 --> 44:26.960
for these guys that are short.

44:26.995 --> 44:28.863
This is gonna be a
major short squeeze.

44:28.898 --> 44:31.162
- What's known as
a short squeeze.

44:31.197 --> 44:32.625
- Short squeeze is a term

44:32.660 --> 44:33.560
that sounds really
hard to understand,

44:33.595 --> 44:35.034
but it's not that complicated.

44:35.069 --> 44:37.806
It's basically when a share
price of a certain stock

44:37.841 --> 44:39.808
skyrockets very fast

44:39.843 --> 44:41.975
and it causes the
people who were betting

44:42.010 --> 44:45.748
that that stock will go down
in price tons of losses.

44:47.884 --> 44:52.678
- I kept on at GMEshortsqueeze
because I knew the story.

44:52.713 --> 44:54.823
- And I'm like, that guy
feels so strong about it,

44:54.858 --> 44:57.826
he named himself
GMEshortsqueeze.

44:57.861 --> 44:58.728
- Hey, I gotta say,

44:58.763 --> 45:00.653
you know I've been kind of like,

45:00.688 --> 45:01.654
is that squeeze gonna happen?

45:01.689 --> 45:02.655
Is this squeeze coming?

45:02.690 --> 45:03.832
But today, I mean,

45:03.867 --> 45:05.097
I think most people would agree

45:05.132 --> 45:07.099
that felt a little bit
squeezy today, right?

45:07.134 --> 45:09.332
- [Dmitriy] I frankly
thought that the probability

45:09.367 --> 45:11.565
of the real short
squeeze was very low.

45:12.733 --> 45:14.073
- GameStop, I don't know.

45:14.108 --> 45:15.943
We just gotta to
see what happens,

45:15.978 --> 45:18.044
but it would be nice if
it goes up really quickly.

45:18.079 --> 45:20.244
- Wait, if this is
true, then this is true.

45:20.279 --> 45:21.674
And if that's true,

45:21.709 --> 45:23.280
then it's gonna set off
this chain of events

45:23.315 --> 45:26.954
where this firestorm of
buying will just happen

45:26.989 --> 45:29.319
and shoot this
thing to the moon.

45:30.619 --> 45:31.860
- That always had me motivated

45:31.895 --> 45:33.389
and like excited for the future.

45:33.424 --> 45:37.063
Like, oh man, something
cool might happen here.

45:37.098 --> 45:38.592
- The allure of a short squeeze

45:38.627 --> 45:40.132
was kind of just
a cherry on top.

45:42.763 --> 45:44.301
It gave GameStop sex appeal.

45:45.843 --> 45:47.733
- Joe sends out a tweet,

45:47.768 --> 45:50.978
literally saying the
squeeze is coming next week,

45:51.013 --> 45:52.606
trust me, mark my word.

45:54.082 --> 45:55.741
- Wall Street Bets picked it up

45:55.776 --> 45:58.480
and you start seeing all this
crazy short squeeze rhetoric.

46:00.924 --> 46:04.827
- The last article I wrote,
I concluded it as following,

46:04.862 --> 46:08.061
almost anything is
possible except bankruptcy.

46:08.096 --> 46:10.833
Even bond holders currently
ascribe zero chance

46:10.868 --> 46:14.331
of GameStop going
bankrupt by 2023.

46:14.366 --> 46:16.234
The short seller thesis is dead.

46:16.269 --> 46:19.237
GameStop is not Blockbuster.

46:19.272 --> 46:20.733
Get your popcorn ready.

46:20.768 --> 46:22.306
This story isn't over yet.

46:23.848 --> 46:25.639
- [Male Speaker] Holy shit.

46:25.674 --> 46:26.915
GameStop's website just crashed

46:26.950 --> 46:29.742
'cause everybody's
trying to order the PS5.

46:29.777 --> 46:32.184
The stock is gonna
skyrocket tomorrow.

46:32.219 --> 46:34.857
- GameStop just did
all of their pre-sales

46:34.892 --> 46:37.926
for the PlayStation
5 and the new Xbox.

46:37.961 --> 46:42.029
And Rod is like, send
me your order numbers.

46:43.230 --> 46:45.692
- I placed a bunch of
orders on GameStop.com

46:45.727 --> 46:47.793
and I was looking
at my order numbers,

46:47.828 --> 46:49.333
and I'm like,

46:49.368 --> 46:51.764
this really looks like it's
just going up sequentially.

46:51.799 --> 46:53.436
- So if you place an order,

46:53.471 --> 46:55.009
and then someone places
an order right after you,

46:55.044 --> 46:56.879
their order number's one higher.

46:56.914 --> 46:58.441
And you could use
that to analyze,

46:58.476 --> 47:00.509
well, how many sales
did GameStop get today?

47:03.811 --> 47:04.953
- All of a sudden,

47:04.988 --> 47:05.888
everyone just
started providing Rod

47:05.923 --> 47:07.186
with all these order numbers.

47:12.160 --> 47:15.194
- They are all out of
PlayStation 5's already.

47:15.229 --> 47:17.064
It goes to show you the demand.

47:17.099 --> 47:18.901
- It tells me the
brand's not dead

47:18.936 --> 47:21.002
and it tells me there's
still a rabid consumer base

47:21.037 --> 47:22.102
that wants their products.

47:23.831 --> 47:26.139
- I personally bought a
lot more GameStop products

47:26.174 --> 47:27.976
just to see what the
order number was.

47:28.011 --> 47:31.540
- I went into GameStop today
to pick up some more boxes.

47:34.017 --> 47:36.314
- I never go to GameStop.

47:36.349 --> 47:37.843
- Who shops there anymore?

47:37.878 --> 47:38.811
- They're dead.

47:38.846 --> 47:40.989
There's no one shopping there.

47:41.024 --> 47:42.815
- I'm just like, that's
complete bullshit

47:42.850 --> 47:45.059
because people are Googling it.

47:46.029 --> 47:47.853
- [Justin] Farris had discovered

47:47.888 --> 47:52.000
the number one search
on Google was GameStop.

47:52.035 --> 47:53.397
(laughing)

47:53.432 --> 47:58.435
- Ryan Cohen sent an insane
letter to the company.

47:59.867 --> 48:01.768
- The guy clearly has a
vision now in this letter.

48:01.803 --> 48:05.013
- It highlights what he
wants to do with the company.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.048
He was basically
doing all the things

48:07.083 --> 48:08.181
I feel like we've
been talking about

48:08.216 --> 48:09.842
in this Roaring Kitty chat.

48:09.877 --> 48:11.877
- He actually might be thinking

48:11.912 --> 48:15.221
about taking over
the company himself.

48:15.256 --> 48:16.618
- That's something, huh?

48:18.787 --> 48:20.292
- The kids are gonna lose it

48:20.327 --> 48:22.129
when they open these
gifts from GameStop.

48:23.825 --> 48:27.134
(upbeat electronic music)

48:41.986 --> 48:44.382
- Breaking freaking news,

48:44.417 --> 48:49.222
Microsoft has entered a
multi-year strategic partnership

48:49.257 --> 48:50.454
with GameStop.

48:51.193 --> 48:52.159
What?

48:53.921 --> 48:55.228
- The Microsoft deal came out

48:55.263 --> 48:57.967
and that's something
that Justin uncovered.

48:58.002 --> 49:00.299
- Justin did some serious
due diligence here

49:00.334 --> 49:02.301
trying to pick apart
what the hell they meant

49:02.336 --> 49:03.236
in this press release,

49:03.271 --> 49:05.139
kind of tearing it to shreds.

49:05.174 --> 49:08.901
- I was able to confirm it
was a revenue share agreement.

49:08.936 --> 49:11.178
I put that out as a tweet.

49:11.213 --> 49:13.147
- That means that GameStop

49:13.182 --> 49:14.775
is gonna be getting a
huge chunk of money.

49:14.810 --> 49:16.843
- If they signed up for
Game Pass through GameStop,

49:16.878 --> 49:18.251
does that mean
that you got a cut?

49:18.286 --> 49:19.813
Yeah, that's what it means.

49:19.848 --> 49:22.453
- It's basically pure
profit to GameStop.

49:22.488 --> 49:25.951
- This is a major
multi-year deal.

49:25.986 --> 49:27.524
- [Male Speaker] DOMO
Capital Management President,

49:27.559 --> 49:29.592
Justin Dopierala.

49:29.627 --> 49:31.000
- Just look at this.

49:31.035 --> 49:32.265
Justin, 300 likes,
61 quote tweets.

49:32.300 --> 49:33.398
He's a celebrity.

49:34.467 --> 49:36.170
- There's some times
I have some reaction

49:36.205 --> 49:38.337
when good news comes
out, like, yeah!

49:40.506 --> 49:43.276
- We got a famous person
on the stream here tonight,

49:43.311 --> 49:44.871
so props to Justin,

49:44.906 --> 49:46.411
Justin getting the
word out right.

49:53.222 --> 49:54.617
- [Jenn] Everyone
on Wall Street Bets

49:54.652 --> 49:56.982
started going
crazy for GameStop.

49:57.017 --> 49:58.654
- On my desk right now

49:58.689 --> 50:00.821
is perhaps the best thing I've
seen in the last six months.

50:00.856 --> 50:03.989
- And wanted to be a part of it.

50:04.024 --> 50:05.232
- It's called GameStop.

50:05.267 --> 50:06.893
- Things started
blowing up on Reddit.

50:06.928 --> 50:08.466
- Hey, everyone's
talking about GameStop.

50:08.501 --> 50:10.138
Should we buy?

50:10.173 --> 50:14.868
- This stock could run to $50,
$100, or even to the moon.

50:18.379 --> 50:21.380
(monkey vocalizing)

50:23.384 --> 50:24.548
- Now that people started seeing

50:24.583 --> 50:26.517
the Chewification of gaming,

50:26.552 --> 50:29.982
my graphics started popping
up on Wall Street Bets

50:30.017 --> 50:31.225
and going viral.

50:31.260 --> 50:34.492
People would start
mentioning rhetoric

50:34.527 --> 50:38.892
and content in the same
way that I would phrase it.

50:38.927 --> 50:41.103
It was too much
of a coincidence.

50:41.138 --> 50:43.897
And it was my graphic in
someone else's Reddit article.

50:45.637 --> 50:47.032
- Have you heard of GameStop?

50:47.067 --> 50:48.671
- [Male Speaker]
GameStop surges 44%.

50:48.706 --> 50:50.937
- [Male Speaker] Their stock
did kind of go up quite a bit.

50:50.972 --> 50:53.511
- GameStop ascended
to meme stock status

50:53.546 --> 50:56.943
after the brilliant, amazing,
incredible Ryan Cohen,

50:56.978 --> 50:58.186
the co-founder of Chewy,

50:58.221 --> 50:59.517
bought a big chunk of stock

50:59.552 --> 51:01.013
and joined the
board of directors.

51:01.048 --> 51:03.587
- Today, they
announced Ryan Cohen

51:03.622 --> 51:06.755
is going to be a board member.

51:08.132 --> 51:10.363
- Hey, finally, guys,
you finally woke up.

51:10.398 --> 51:12.024
I've been posting
about this for a year.

51:12.059 --> 51:13.333
You guys blocked me.

51:20.672 --> 51:23.574
- I was really
struggling financially

51:23.609 --> 51:27.149
because I wasn't selling
like I needed to sell

51:27.184 --> 51:29.283
to pay off debt, and I didn't.

51:30.583 --> 51:33.221
it was more than just a share.

51:33.256 --> 51:34.915
It was more than just money.

51:36.457 --> 51:38.985
I also needed to get a job

51:39.020 --> 51:40.624
and that was also
stressing me out.

51:42.166 --> 51:45.662
But then Christmas Eve in 2020,

51:45.697 --> 51:47.532
I found out that I
had breast cancer.

51:50.174 --> 51:52.339
I wasn't even on health
insurance at the time

51:52.374 --> 51:53.934
because I was unemployed.

51:56.103 --> 52:01.183
It wasn't an expense that I
had planned for, obviously.

52:01.218 --> 52:03.317
Like, no one plans to
have breast cancer.

52:06.784 --> 52:09.620
I ended up crying
every single day,

52:09.655 --> 52:12.359
not knowing how I'm going
to afford chemotherapy,

52:12.394 --> 52:16.462
like a lifesaving, a
lifesaving treatment.

52:21.205 --> 52:26.208
I was using GameStop
to distract myself

52:27.068 --> 52:28.342
from this really dark time.

52:32.040 --> 52:33.314
All day, it was like,

52:33.349 --> 52:34.612
I was going to
doctor's appointments

52:34.647 --> 52:37.813
and I was checking the
GameStop stock chart

52:37.848 --> 52:39.518
at my doctor's appointments.

52:41.148 --> 52:42.488
Is this price going up?

52:42.523 --> 52:43.819
Like, is it time to sell?

52:43.854 --> 52:46.393
Should I wait, should I
hold, should I buy more,

52:46.428 --> 52:49.121
or like, just see
what's gonna happen?

52:49.156 --> 52:50.562
And then like also,

52:50.597 --> 52:54.060
like making all these
life changing decisions.

52:54.095 --> 52:56.700
It was like an emotion
I couldn't even process.

52:58.506 --> 53:00.000
I'm getting a lot
of messages today

53:00.035 --> 53:03.344
about GameStop share
price going to $20.

53:03.379 --> 53:06.479
I've been in this company
since the beginning.

53:06.514 --> 53:08.745
I don't know what's
gonna happen next,

53:08.780 --> 53:10.384
but I'm not selling.

53:10.419 --> 53:11.814
- Meanwhile, the stock,

53:11.849 --> 53:16.687
it was just kind of hovering
around like 24, $22.

DeepFuckingValue shared his

53:32.639 --> 53:36.245
but stamped into it was a
picture of Roaring Kitty.

53:38.744 --> 53:39.578
- Surprise.

53:42.286 --> 53:46.354
- It was him saying that
he was DeepFuckingValue

53:46.389 --> 53:49.148
without him explicitly saying
that he was DeepFuckingValue.

53:50.657 --> 53:52.327
- This was a true YOLO for me.

53:53.396 --> 53:56.430
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:56.465 --> 53:57.398
This is insane.

53:57.433 --> 53:58.399
This is nutty.

53:59.567 --> 54:01.633
- When I was building

54:01.668 --> 54:04.372
we had nowhere close

54:08.268 --> 54:11.775

he was DeepFuckingValue,

54:11.810 --> 54:14.283
that just intensified
everything.

54:14.318 --> 54:15.878

54:51.685 --> 54:54.422
- [Jenn] There were thousands
of people in the stream.

54:54.457 --> 54:56.248
I mean, it was crazy.

54:56.283 --> 54:59.856
(upbeat rock music)

54:59.891 --> 55:02.430
We couldn't have an
intellectual conversation

55:02.465 --> 55:03.794
because it was just
getting blown up

55:03.829 --> 55:05.367
with like rocket emojis.

55:05.402 --> 55:07.633
- It just king of
destroyed the community

55:07.668 --> 55:09.030
that had been built up.

55:10.968 --> 55:12.770
- I just messaged on there
one day and was like,

55:12.805 --> 55:16.301
hey, like, anyone from
the previous people here?

55:16.336 --> 55:18.776
And then Jenn reached out
to me like, hey, Rigo.

55:18.811 --> 55:21.350
- We created our
own like side chat,

It's hilarious.

55:35.663 --> 55:37.498
- [Dmitriy] There was
a lot of enthusiasm.

55:37.533 --> 55:39.500
- I could get used to that.

55:39.535 --> 55:41.370
- They were believing

55:41.405 --> 55:44.032
that the short squeeze
was almost inevitable.

55:44.067 --> 55:46.375

55:49.578 --> 55:51.303

Capital got found out

that they were shorting this
to the point that they did,

55:53.780 --> 55:55.549
Reddit saw that happening,

55:55.584 --> 55:58.453
and they said, whoa, whoa,
whoa, we can stop this.

56:03.559 --> 56:04.855
- My friends were
starting to be like,

56:04.890 --> 56:06.890
oh, well, maybe she had a point.

56:09.598 --> 56:11.323
And this is where
my dad was like,

56:11.358 --> 56:12.896
oh, maybe you're not crazy.

56:12.931 --> 56:13.864
And my mom was like,

56:13.899 --> 56:15.437
should we invest in GameStop?

56:17.870 --> 56:19.870
No longer was I
this crazy person.

56:23.040 --> 56:25.007
- Yo, a bunch of people
online just realized

56:25.042 --> 56:28.582
if they buy a bunch of stock
that hedge funds are shorting,

56:28.617 --> 56:30.584
they can actually force
the hedge fund's position

56:30.619 --> 56:31.684
and take a bunch of their money.

56:31.719 --> 56:33.015
Isn't that cool?

56:33.050 --> 56:35.347
- Oh, we're bad people.

56:35.382 --> 56:36.854
I hear that all the time.

56:36.889 --> 56:40.022
- The worst of the worst,
the worst of the worst.

56:40.057 --> 56:41.287
- First of all, I'm
not a short seller.

56:41.322 --> 56:42.926
I'm an investor.

56:42.961 --> 56:44.862
I'm an investor whose specialty
happens to be short-selling.

56:44.897 --> 56:49.735
- Andrew Left, you are
shorting Tesla, I understand.

56:49.770 --> 56:51.572
- I have a small short
position, yes, I do.

56:51.607 --> 56:53.937
So when people
dislike short sellers,

56:55.006 --> 56:56.401
it's just misinformed.

56:56.436 --> 56:57.644
The short sellers come in

56:57.679 --> 56:59.877
and give you another
side of the story.

56:59.912 --> 57:03.078
Short sellers actually
help regulate the market.

57:08.448 --> 57:12.021
(intense orchestral music)

57:14.762 --> 57:16.465
When the stock in
January hit 40,

57:16.500 --> 57:18.390
it was at all time highs.

57:18.425 --> 57:19.600
Next, let's move on
to their business.

57:19.635 --> 57:22.394
- Yes, let's move on
to their business.

57:22.429 --> 57:25.507
- Their business trajectory
was at all time lows.

57:25.542 --> 57:29.071
Traditionally, that would be
a good time to short a stock.

57:29.106 --> 57:30.677
- Andrew Left (indistinct)

57:30.712 --> 57:31.942
I was gonna have
these five reasons

57:31.977 --> 57:33.812
of why GameStop was a
horrible investment.

57:35.816 --> 57:38.817
I thought, oh, maybe he's
discovered something.

57:38.852 --> 57:40.346
- Justin,

57:40.381 --> 57:42.315
I mean, when he spoke,
we listened, you know?

57:43.626 --> 57:46.352
- Knowing Justin's reputation,
I was getting scared.

57:46.387 --> 57:47.661
I was like, oh, you know,

57:47.696 --> 57:49.465
if this guy is
thinking about selling,

57:50.633 --> 57:52.292
why am I not thinking
about selling?

57:53.966 --> 57:56.131
- I was getting really scared.

57:58.069 --> 58:00.036
- It was constant monitoring.

58:00.071 --> 58:02.511
And you're like, oh man,
this could tank any day.

58:06.979 --> 58:09.012
- I play the ball, not the man.

58:09.047 --> 58:11.047
I looked at the business itself

58:11.082 --> 58:14.523
and it wasn't making
the progress they
would have desired.

58:16.593 --> 58:17.955
- There we go,

58:17.990 --> 58:20.122
Andrew Left live
on the Power Hour.

58:20.157 --> 58:21.563
- Andrew is brilliant.

58:22.566 --> 58:23.664
The difference between Andrew

58:23.699 --> 58:25.457
and a lot of other short sellers

58:25.492 --> 58:27.492
is that he generally
gets on companies

58:27.527 --> 58:28.999
that are really disasters.

58:29.034 --> 58:30.462
- Please, sue me.

58:30.497 --> 58:31.903
Let's go.

58:31.938 --> 58:33.366
I will take your whole
company from top-down.

58:35.876 --> 58:37.876
- Most of my clients
are not very wealthy.

58:37.911 --> 58:39.581
They're just everyday people.

58:41.541 --> 58:42.881
It wasn't worth the risk.

58:44.951 --> 58:47.688
- Justin Dopierala gets on
our group chat being like,

58:47.723 --> 58:50.515
hey, guys, I just
want to let you know

58:50.550 --> 58:54.387
that I sold all of
DOMO's shares in GameStop

58:54.422 --> 58:55.564
a little bit above 40.

58:58.030 --> 58:58.897
What?

59:06.104 --> 59:07.609
Is this something that
we should be doing?

59:07.644 --> 59:09.743
Like, why are you selling?

59:10.537 --> 59:12.009
- He's like,

59:12.044 --> 59:15.177
maybe you should think about
getting out of GameStop.

59:15.212 --> 59:18.015
- I just didn't want to
see anyone get burned.

59:18.050 --> 59:20.116
- I thought about it
multiple times to sell.

59:21.548 --> 59:23.020
- [Male Speaker] I
completely understand

59:23.055 --> 59:25.451
where DOMO's coming
from with this.

59:25.486 --> 59:28.762
- I didn't intend to
sell all the shares,

59:28.797 --> 59:30.698
but as I started
selling more and more,

59:30.733 --> 59:33.261
there just was almost like
a weight off my shoulders

59:33.296 --> 59:34.526
and it just became evident to me

59:34.561 --> 59:36.869
that this was the
right thing to do.

59:36.904 --> 59:39.971
- It's hard to buy things
that everyone hates

59:40.006 --> 59:42.677
and it's hard to sell
things that everyone loves,

59:43.845 --> 59:45.812
but you should buy them
when people hate them

59:45.847 --> 59:47.946
and you should sell
when people love them.

59:50.951 --> 59:52.819
- Okay, if you bought at four,

59:52.854 --> 59:55.624
now, you're up almost 1,000%.

59:55.659 --> 59:57.120
Amazing.
You should sell, right?

59:58.695 --> 1:00:01.454
No, not if it's worth
a lot more than that.

1:00:02.589 --> 1:00:04.160
You should be buying
more actually.

1:00:05.933 --> 1:00:07.900
Look, we need to put
something together

1:00:07.935 --> 1:00:11.464
as a counter to what Andrew
puts out with Citron.

1:00:14.810 --> 1:00:17.646
We compiled all of that
industry information,

1:00:17.681 --> 1:00:20.572
he made it all open source
that people could access.

1:00:20.607 --> 1:00:22.684
- We wanted the media to have
a place they could turn to

1:00:22.719 --> 1:00:25.478
and be like, well,
GMEdd says differently.

1:00:29.121 --> 1:00:32.793
I had seen Rod's
postings for months

1:00:32.828 --> 1:00:35.191
and I saw he was creating GMEdd.

1:00:39.967 --> 1:00:42.132
- [Abbe] Rod sort of
took Joe under his wing.

1:00:43.564 --> 1:00:46.840
- Rod and I get along like
Jesse Pinkman and Walter White.

1:00:46.875 --> 1:00:48.171
He understands the financials

1:00:48.206 --> 1:00:50.305
and I understand the
social side of it.

1:00:51.572 --> 1:00:54.683
- Rod is the cook,
Joe is the peddler.

1:00:54.718 --> 1:00:55.783
- $40,000.

1:00:55.818 --> 1:00:57.114
- Hey, you said,
raise the prices.

1:00:57.149 --> 1:00:59.545
- It's really a great
relationship they have.

1:00:59.580 --> 1:01:01.184
(cheering)

1:01:01.219 --> 1:01:01.987
- Yes!

1:01:02.022 --> 1:01:03.582
- And they have a van.

1:01:07.159 --> 1:01:09.731
- Nobody knows what the
price should be precisely,

1:01:09.766 --> 1:01:11.227
but we could at least
paint a picture.

1:01:11.262 --> 1:01:13.196
And I thought we
painted a damn good one.

1:01:14.870 --> 1:01:17.706
- And 69 was, you know.

1:01:21.173 --> 1:01:23.745
- So, let's talk stocks, people.

1:01:23.780 --> 1:01:26.308
I'm gonna put out a presentation
today about my thesis,

1:01:26.343 --> 1:01:28.717
five reasons why GameStop
is going back to $20

1:01:28.752 --> 1:01:30.213
and it's going
there pretty fast.

1:01:30.248 --> 1:01:32.644
- When Andrew makes a
comment about something,

1:01:32.679 --> 1:01:34.316
people take it pretty serious

1:01:34.351 --> 1:01:37.825
because he's a very serious
guy who does very serious work.

1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:40.190
- Hey, this is Andrew
Left at Citron Research

1:01:40.225 --> 1:01:43.556
giving you five reasons why
GameStop is going to 20.

1:01:45.769 --> 1:01:48.198
- [Farris] His web stream died.

1:01:49.696 --> 1:01:51.630
- And it kept doing
the wheel of death.

1:01:53.205 --> 1:01:55.601
- You have this
big, bad boogeyman

1:01:55.636 --> 1:01:57.537
that's gonna put out a
research report this week.

1:01:57.572 --> 1:01:59.011
Then he postpones
it to the next week.

1:01:59.046 --> 1:02:00.705
So obviously, you
have all these people

1:02:00.740 --> 1:02:02.245
that are scared of
what he's gonna say.

1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:04.049
And people are gonna
sell beforehand.

1:02:08.715 --> 1:02:11.683
- One, this is a failing
mall-based retailer.

1:02:11.718 --> 1:02:13.927
- Less than 10%
Of the U.S. stores

1:02:13.962 --> 1:02:16.127
are in traditional malls.

1:02:16.162 --> 1:02:19.801
- Number two, numbers don't lie.

1:02:19.836 --> 1:02:21.198
People lie.

1:02:21.233 --> 1:02:25.367
- He's not saying anything
that we don't know.

1:02:25.402 --> 1:02:28.876
- Number three,
valuations matter.

1:02:28.911 --> 1:02:31.439
There were down
17% year over year.

1:02:31.474 --> 1:02:33.210
I was just bringing
out hard data,

1:02:33.245 --> 1:02:35.784
which traditionally,
stocks trade on.

1:02:35.819 --> 1:02:39.216
- He didn't dive deep into
GameStop's fundamentals.

1:02:39.251 --> 1:02:40.888
- Number four,

1:02:40.923 --> 1:02:43.990
there's no short squeeze that
is happening as we speak.

1:02:44.025 --> 1:02:46.289
- Everything that he said
was complete bullshit.

1:02:46.324 --> 1:02:47.752
- And last thing

1:02:47.787 --> 1:02:49.754
is the company could
be Blockbuster video

1:02:49.789 --> 1:02:51.800
that never adapted
to technology.

1:02:51.835 --> 1:02:53.065
- It's Blockbuster 2.0.

1:02:53.100 --> 1:02:55.903
I'm like, really, dude?

1:02:55.938 --> 1:02:57.971
- I know who's long
GameStop right now,

1:02:58.006 --> 1:02:59.841
the people who are
ordering pizzas to my house

1:02:59.876 --> 1:03:01.106
or signing me up for Tinder.

1:03:02.945 --> 1:03:06.078
In retrospect, I probably
should not have done a video,

1:03:06.113 --> 1:03:09.917
but maybe I thought at the
time it is a bit of hubris.

1:03:09.952 --> 1:03:13.085
Everyone started calling me
a boomer, a loser, old man.

1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:16.154
And I'm like, then I realized
something's bigger here.

1:03:17.355 --> 1:03:18.750
I didn't realize
it was gonna become

1:03:18.785 --> 1:03:21.027
some form of default
religion or something.

1:03:22.789 --> 1:03:25.790
- The stock was
bubbling by that time,

1:03:25.825 --> 1:03:27.836
it's just ready to explode.

1:03:27.871 --> 1:03:31.499
(intense orchestral music)

1:03:33.976 --> 1:03:35.943
- Whether you are in
the stock market or not,

1:03:35.978 --> 1:03:39.848
you have probably heard in the
last 24 hours about GameStop.

1:03:39.883 --> 1:03:43.577
(upbeat electronic music)

1:03:45.020 --> 1:03:46.888
- GameStop is killing it!

1:03:48.485 --> 1:03:49.990
- The game retailer GameStop

1:03:50.025 --> 1:03:52.520
has set to continue their
head-spinning ascent today.

1:03:53.424 --> 1:03:54.588
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

1:03:56.196 --> 1:03:59.758
- (indistinct) $15,000!

1:04:01.333 --> 1:04:02.464
- [Female Speaker]
This involves a firm

1:04:02.499 --> 1:04:03.828
called Melvin Capital.

1:04:03.863 --> 1:04:06.204
- Melvin Capital.
- Melvin Capital.

1:04:06.239 --> 1:04:08.206
- The ploy to wipe out
Gabe Plotkin's firm

1:04:08.241 --> 1:04:10.978
surfaced on the subreddit forum
known as Wall Street Bets.

1:04:11.013 --> 1:04:12.804
- A bunch of crazy
white boys on Reddit

1:04:12.839 --> 1:04:15.411
have driven the
price up to $123.

1:04:15.446 --> 1:04:18.612
(upbeat electronic music)

1:04:20.121 --> 1:04:21.923
- Yeah, I was maybe
a little concerned

1:04:21.958 --> 1:04:23.254
for the people that
were still in it.

1:04:23.289 --> 1:04:25.322
- Are you guys
watching GameStop?

1:04:25.357 --> 1:04:27.324
It just hit 200 a
couple of minutes ago.

1:04:27.359 --> 1:04:28.292
It's crazy!

1:04:32.364 --> 1:04:35.728
- It was just GameStop
day and night.

1:04:35.763 --> 1:04:39.402
And while I'm preparing
myself for chemo,

1:04:39.437 --> 1:04:41.272
it was just too much going on.

1:04:42.110 --> 1:04:43.769
- Huge blow,

1:04:43.804 --> 1:04:46.442
Melvin suffering losses
upwards of 30% in a year.

1:04:46.477 --> 1:04:51.645
- I'm Tyrone and I'm here to
fuck Melvin's Capital's wife,
GameStop style.

1:04:53.154 --> 1:04:55.385
- [Male Speaker] Cohen and
Griffin of hedge fund fame

1:04:55.420 --> 1:04:57.684
have come in and bailed
out a hedge fund.

1:04:57.719 --> 1:04:59.521
- [Male Speaker] Citadel's
all over this thing.

1:04:59.556 --> 1:05:04.031
- Citadel gave Melvin a
$2.75 billion cash infusion.

1:05:04.066 --> 1:05:05.967
(vehicle crashing)

1:05:06.002 --> 1:05:08.464
- Mr. Griffin, let me
tell you something,

1:05:08.499 --> 1:05:11.434
there's only one Kenny
G and it ain't you.

1:05:14.835 --> 1:05:16.076
- [Male Speaker] Elon Musk
jumping into the action,

1:05:16.111 --> 1:05:20.245
tweeting gamestonk.

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.445
(sobbing)

1:05:23.349 --> 1:05:24.810
- Fuck Wall Street.

1:05:24.845 --> 1:05:26.152
- Fuck Wall Street.

1:05:26.187 --> 1:05:27.747
- Fuck Wall Street.

1:05:31.588 --> 1:05:33.885
- They go after the ones
that are heavily shorted

1:05:33.920 --> 1:05:35.887
in order to come up
with the short squeeze.

1:05:35.922 --> 1:05:37.394
- [Female Speaker] And
it raised the price,

1:05:37.429 --> 1:05:40.001
forcing these major hedge
funds to lose a ton of dough.

1:05:40.036 --> 1:05:41.398
(man yelling)

1:05:41.433 --> 1:05:43.235
- [Female Speaker] Those
betting against GameStop

1:05:43.270 --> 1:05:47.272
lost $14.3 billion today alone.

1:05:47.307 --> 1:05:49.076
- I was on a golf course.

1:05:49.111 --> 1:05:52.112
I wasn't checking my
emails or my messages.

1:05:52.147 --> 1:05:53.982
And then I went home that day

1:05:54.017 --> 1:05:54.983
and I'm like, oh my God.

1:06:00.485 --> 1:06:01.814
- People lost their minds.

1:06:04.984 --> 1:06:08.095
The interesting thing is
there were other hedge funds

1:06:08.130 --> 1:06:10.856
who were investing in GameStop.

1:06:10.891 --> 1:06:13.034
- I think the hedge funds
saw blood in the water.

1:06:13.069 --> 1:06:16.103
- If you don't think a hedge
fund would buy this stock at 70

1:06:16.138 --> 1:06:16.961
thinking it was going to 350,

1:06:16.996 --> 1:06:18.006
you're wrong.

1:06:18.041 --> 1:06:19.271
Everyone would do it.

1:06:19.306 --> 1:06:21.933
- There will be carnage,
I can guarantee you.

1:06:21.968 --> 1:06:23.143
- It was a little bit too crazy.

1:06:25.213 --> 1:06:28.445
I started taking profits.

1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:30.645
- I just thought, okay, I'm out.

1:06:31.648 --> 1:06:34.154
- You want to take
profits when you can.

1:06:34.189 --> 1:06:35.914
- Keep moving, keep ahead!

1:06:38.061 --> 1:06:39.291
- My wife,

1:06:39.326 --> 1:06:42.195
I was like, babe, I
don't know what to do.

1:06:42.230 --> 1:06:43.328
She's like, don't look at me.

1:06:43.363 --> 1:06:45.495
I don't know anything about it.

1:06:45.530 --> 1:06:46.463
I was like, should I sell it?

1:06:46.498 --> 1:06:47.464
She was like, I don't know.

1:06:47.499 --> 1:06:48.828
(people cheering)

1:06:48.863 --> 1:06:51.567
- I was just like,
loving the chaos.

1:06:58.345 --> 1:06:59.839
- My parents found
out about GameStop

1:06:59.874 --> 1:07:02.380
when the New York Times
put out its cover story

1:07:02.415 --> 1:07:03.843
with me in it.

1:07:03.878 --> 1:07:08.386
- Joe's face is right
there with Ryan Cohen,

1:07:09.257 --> 1:07:11.257
Roaring Kitty, and Rod Alzmann.

1:07:11.292 --> 1:07:13.193
- What was it about it
that made you believe

1:07:13.228 --> 1:07:15.492
that there was a
growth story there

1:07:15.527 --> 1:07:16.988
that no one else saw?

1:07:17.023 --> 1:07:19.793
- It sure felt like I was
wrong for a long time.

1:07:22.028 --> 1:07:24.072
- This picture is
just hilarious to me

1:07:24.107 --> 1:07:25.502
because it was just something

1:07:25.537 --> 1:07:27.405
I never even could
have dreamed of.

1:07:30.146 --> 1:07:31.508
- [Male Speaker] The
Roaring Kitty on YouTube,

1:07:31.543 --> 1:07:33.114
DFV on Reddit.

1:07:33.149 --> 1:07:35.875
And of course, now we all
know his name is Keith Gill.

1:07:42.224 --> 1:07:43.091
- What?

1:07:44.391 --> 1:07:47.018
- [Male Speaker] Melvin Capital
is now out of the stock.

1:07:47.053 --> 1:07:50.296
They've taken a
rather huge loss.

1:07:52.465 --> 1:07:56.566
- It was the perfect storm
to destroy a hedge fund.

1:08:00.968 --> 1:08:03.210
- [Male Speaker] This is the
Citadel headquarter in Chicago,

1:08:03.245 --> 1:08:05.036
the center of this
GameStop drama.

1:08:05.071 --> 1:08:06.114
They're the biggest market maker

1:08:06.149 --> 1:08:08.314
and hedge fund in the world.

1:08:08.349 --> 1:08:10.613
- So when Citadel got involved,

1:08:10.648 --> 1:08:13.385
I called my brother who
worked in the financial world.

1:08:13.420 --> 1:08:17.048
He's like, dude, Citadel's
getting involved?

1:08:17.083 --> 1:08:20.326
Whoa, Citadel like
runs the world, man.

1:08:21.857 --> 1:08:25.661
That doesn't bode well for
the future of GameStop.

1:08:30.866 --> 1:08:32.635
- GameStop shares tanking today.

1:08:34.672 --> 1:08:36.771
- GameStop shares
have been tumbling

1:08:36.806 --> 1:08:40.643
as a growing number of
firms move to halt trading.

1:08:40.678 --> 1:08:42.975
- The action is so
wild that TD Ameritrade

1:08:43.010 --> 1:08:45.252
and Robinhood have restricted
trading of these stocks.

1:08:45.287 --> 1:08:47.419
- [Female Speaker] Forcing
GameStop's shares to drop

1:08:47.454 --> 1:08:48.783
like a ton of bricks.

1:08:48.818 --> 1:08:50.356
- The stocks just plummeted.

1:08:52.118 --> 1:08:54.591
- Now, if you can
only sell stocks,

1:08:54.626 --> 1:08:56.164
those stocks only go down.

1:08:56.199 --> 1:08:59.761
- They said, well, the
crazies can't buy it anymore.

1:08:59.796 --> 1:09:02.500
Well, the only reason it's
up is because of the crazies.

1:09:02.535 --> 1:09:04.535
- I am beyond frustrated.

1:09:04.570 --> 1:09:08.506
My portfolio is getting
absolutely obliterated today.

1:09:08.541 --> 1:09:11.179
- [Female Speaker] A class
action complaint was just filed

1:09:11.214 --> 1:09:13.973
in the Southern District of
New York against Robinhood.

1:09:15.075 --> 1:09:16.613
- Why?

1:09:16.648 --> 1:09:17.548
Why?

1:09:17.583 --> 1:09:18.978
Explain why you had to do it

1:09:19.013 --> 1:09:21.189
if it wasn't to protect
the big hedge funds.

1:09:22.654 --> 1:09:25.292
- They sell information they
gather from their customers

1:09:25.327 --> 1:09:28.119
to the hedge funds who use
it for their advantage,

1:09:28.154 --> 1:09:29.758
and most customers
don't even know.

1:09:30.596 --> 1:09:32.563
- Robinhood trades are not free.

1:09:32.598 --> 1:09:35.126
When you pay for order flow,

1:09:35.161 --> 1:09:36.798
you're probably charging
your customers more

1:09:36.833 --> 1:09:38.338
and pretending to be free.

1:09:38.373 --> 1:09:41.242
- Citadel is actually
Robinhood's biggest customer.

1:09:41.277 --> 1:09:44.410
So when Citadel tells Robinhood
to stop trades on GameStop,

1:09:44.445 --> 1:09:45.642
Robinhood's gonna listen.

1:09:45.677 --> 1:09:47.215
- And that looks like
a stinky conflict

1:09:47.250 --> 1:09:50.042
that you didn't come out
straight on from the start.

1:09:51.782 --> 1:09:53.551
- [Male Speaker] This
is a (beeping) crime

1:09:53.586 --> 1:09:55.586
what Robinhood app is doing.

1:09:55.621 --> 1:09:58.325
Do not sell, hold the line.

1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:00.085
(beeping)

1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:02.263
- [Female Speaker] Somewhat
allegedly threw dog feces

1:10:02.298 --> 1:10:03.825
at the front door.

1:10:03.860 --> 1:10:05.332
- [Male Speaker] One
investor chartered a plane

1:10:05.367 --> 1:10:08.434
to fly a banner over the
company's headquarters saying,

1:10:08.469 --> 1:10:10.403
suck my nuts, Robinhood.

1:10:12.275 --> 1:10:13.505
- I don't think there's
anything nefarious

1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:15.705
behind the scenes as
you hear people say,

1:10:15.740 --> 1:10:19.104
oh, 'cause Ken Griffin
owns a piece of Robinhood.

1:10:19.139 --> 1:10:20.743
No, I don't believe any of that.

1:10:21.878 --> 1:10:23.207
- There's a lot to unpack

1:10:23.242 --> 1:10:24.714
with what happened
with Robinhood

1:10:24.749 --> 1:10:29.455
because that has led to a
lot of conspiracy theories.

1:10:31.327 --> 1:10:33.558
- It's just a little
bit too convenient

1:10:33.593 --> 1:10:36.726
that you got Melvin Capital
losing billions of dollars,

1:10:36.761 --> 1:10:38.365
Citadel backing them.

1:10:38.400 --> 1:10:40.224
And then two days later,

1:10:40.259 --> 1:10:42.996
Robinhood stopping
people from buying it.

1:10:43.900 --> 1:10:45.306
If that's what's happening,

1:10:45.341 --> 1:10:48.672
they all are in bed with
each other, which is scary.

1:10:51.171 --> 1:10:54.205
- But there will never
be any proof, right?

1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:59.177
'Cause no one's gonna
own up to a hedge fund

1:11:00.279 --> 1:11:01.256
colluding with another company.

1:11:05.328 --> 1:11:06.657
- I don't think
that's what happened.

1:11:06.692 --> 1:11:09.220
I think what happened is
they just got stretched.

1:11:09.255 --> 1:11:10.298
- Tenev effectively argued

1:11:10.333 --> 1:11:11.761
that if he didn't
take any action,

1:11:11.796 --> 1:11:14.335
the company would have likely
faced a liquidity issue.

1:11:14.370 --> 1:11:16.161
- I don't believe
it was nefarious,

1:11:16.196 --> 1:11:18.471
but the fact that it was
so poorly communicated

1:11:18.506 --> 1:11:20.308
to the public really
fed into this narrative

1:11:20.343 --> 1:11:23.608
that this was all some
sort of big collusion

1:11:23.643 --> 1:11:25.742
by these hedge funds
that were losing money.

1:11:25.777 --> 1:11:27.315
And when they were
losing the game,

1:11:27.350 --> 1:11:29.240
they were able to just
shut the game off.

1:11:29.275 --> 1:11:30.846
- [Male Speaker] And it's gone!

1:11:30.881 --> 1:11:32.980
- And it has kind of fostered
this whole ape movement.

1:11:34.720 --> 1:11:35.686
- What do we make of this,

1:11:35.721 --> 1:11:37.248
what do we make of the apes?

1:11:37.283 --> 1:11:38.920
- [Rod] The apes have
Robinhood accounts

1:11:38.955 --> 1:11:41.285
and their form of
sticking it to the man

1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:43.760
is buying more of the stocks

1:11:43.795 --> 1:11:45.828
that they were not
allowed to buy.

1:11:47.370 --> 1:11:49.260
- It's hard to tell how
high it would have gone

1:11:49.295 --> 1:11:52.538
if they didn't implement
these restrictions.

1:11:52.573 --> 1:11:54.672
Who knows if there
is a practical limit?

1:11:57.710 --> 1:12:00.304
- Robinhood's decision
and what they did

1:12:00.339 --> 1:12:03.208
absolutely transferred wealth
from the small retail investor

1:12:03.243 --> 1:12:05.276
into the hands of
the big hedge funds

1:12:05.311 --> 1:12:06.849
that were short GameStop.

1:12:08.347 --> 1:12:11.458
- When you have AOC
and Donald Trump Jr.

1:12:11.493 --> 1:12:13.658
both on the same
side of an issue,

1:12:13.693 --> 1:12:15.561
you know something's
dramatically wrong.

1:12:15.596 --> 1:12:19.829
- It is the warning bell
that we have a stock market

1:12:19.864 --> 1:12:21.567
that is subject to manipulation.

1:12:21.602 --> 1:12:24.966
- There are people
buying digital assets
that have no value

1:12:25.001 --> 1:12:27.639
just to make a joke
about it on Twitter.

1:12:27.674 --> 1:12:29.806
- The 99% to 1% meme.

1:12:29.841 --> 1:12:30.708
- What's a meme?

1:12:32.272 --> 1:12:33.711
- I'm so sorry.

1:12:33.746 --> 1:12:36.417
- Meme stocks are
generating so much buzz

1:12:36.452 --> 1:12:38.309
that institutional investors

1:12:38.344 --> 1:12:41.884
and financial institutions are
now generating watch lists.

1:12:41.919 --> 1:12:46.317
AMC, Blackberry has moved for
some reason, and Dogecoin.

1:12:46.352 --> 1:12:47.560
- Which is a cryptocurrency

1:12:47.595 --> 1:12:49.430
that was originally
started off as a joke

1:12:49.465 --> 1:12:51.762
and it is up over 800%.

1:12:51.797 --> 1:12:53.896
The cryptocurrency
equivalent of GameStop.

1:12:56.769 --> 1:12:58.736
- The trading frenzy
around GameStop

1:12:58.771 --> 1:13:00.705
is the focus on
Capitol Hill today.

1:13:06.075 --> 1:13:09.549
- This hearing is
entitled GameStopped:

1:13:10.783 --> 1:13:14.345
Who Wins and Loses
when Short Sellers,

1:13:14.380 --> 1:13:18.349
Social Media, and Retail
Investors Collide.

1:13:18.384 --> 1:13:21.891
I want to know how each of
the witnesses here today

1:13:21.926 --> 1:13:26.291
contributed to the
historic trading events.

1:13:26.326 --> 1:13:27.292
Mr. Plotkin.

1:13:31.936 --> 1:13:32.935
Mr. Plotkin?

1:13:36.336 --> 1:13:38.578
- I was muted.
I apologize, I do.

1:13:38.613 --> 1:13:39.445
- [Maxine] Thank you.

1:13:40.582 --> 1:13:41.977
- There are laws
governing shorting stock,

1:13:42.012 --> 1:13:44.551
and of course, we
always follow them.

1:13:44.586 --> 1:13:45.717
We have been short GameStop

1:13:45.752 --> 1:13:48.379
since Melvin's inception
six years earlier

1:13:48.414 --> 1:13:49.589
because we believed

1:13:49.624 --> 1:13:51.492
and still believe that
its business model

1:13:51.527 --> 1:13:53.417
is being overtaken
by digital downloads

1:13:53.452 --> 1:13:54.286
through the internet.

1:13:55.454 --> 1:13:56.728
In addition.

1:13:56.763 --> 1:13:58.796
- In addition, I am a robot.

1:13:59.865 --> 1:14:01.634
- Mr. Vlad Tenev.

1:14:01.669 --> 1:14:04.505
- Thank you for the invitation
to speak about Robinhood

1:14:04.540 --> 1:14:06.738
and the millions
of people we serve.

1:14:06.773 --> 1:14:09.840
The financial system should
be built to work for everyone,

1:14:09.875 --> 1:14:11.578
not just a select few,

1:14:11.613 --> 1:14:13.844
but only half of U.S.
households participate in.

1:14:13.879 --> 1:14:16.407
- [Maxine] Mr. Tenev,

1:14:16.442 --> 1:14:18.684
I would like you to
use your limited time

1:14:18.719 --> 1:14:22.017
to talk directly to what
happened January 28.

1:14:22.954 --> 1:14:24.085
- Certainly.

1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:25.658
- A lot of attention
on Vlad Tenev.

1:14:25.693 --> 1:14:27.352
He seems to be getting
most of the airtime here

1:14:27.387 --> 1:14:30.421
and most of the questions
are being fielded to him.

1:14:30.456 --> 1:14:31.763
- Mr. Tenev,

1:14:31.798 --> 1:14:35.030
isn't it true that there
was a liquidity problem?

1:14:35.065 --> 1:14:36.801
Could you just answer yes or no?

1:14:38.134 --> 1:14:40.541
- We always felt comfortable
with our liquidity.

1:14:40.576 --> 1:14:42.609
- [Maxine] Please
answer yes or no.

1:14:42.644 --> 1:14:44.171
- We always felt comfortable--

1:14:45.471 --> 1:14:46.547
- I don't have time.

1:14:46.582 --> 1:14:48.010
I just need a yes or no answer.

1:14:50.883 --> 1:14:54.115
- I think that, thank
you for the question.

1:14:54.150 --> 1:14:56.216
It's an important question.

1:14:56.251 --> 1:14:58.449
- Yes or no!

1:14:58.484 --> 1:14:59.890
Yes or no!

1:14:59.925 --> 1:15:02.090
Yes or no!

1:15:03.599 --> 1:15:05.995
- Mr. Griffin, if I could just
ask you the first question,

1:15:06.030 --> 1:15:08.833
how many people are
in the room with you?

1:15:08.868 --> 1:15:10.065
If you can just count

1:15:10.100 --> 1:15:11.363
how many people are
in the room with you.

1:15:14.335 --> 1:15:16.676
- There are five people,
including myself,

1:15:16.711 --> 1:15:17.974
in this room, sir.

1:15:18.009 --> 1:15:18.843
- Awesome.

1:15:21.177 --> 1:15:23.012
- Mr. Gill, my first
question for you

1:15:24.543 --> 1:15:27.511
is how many people are in
the room with you right now?

1:15:27.546 --> 1:15:28.622
- Zero, congressmen.

1:15:30.593 --> 1:15:32.923
- So proud of Roaring Kitty.

1:15:32.958 --> 1:15:34.562
- Roaring Kitty was great.

1:15:34.597 --> 1:15:36.421
- Roaring Kitty was
the most wholesome face

1:15:36.456 --> 1:15:38.060
GameStop could have asked for.

1:15:38.095 --> 1:15:40.832
- Mr. Gill, you are now
recognized for five minutes--

1:15:40.867 --> 1:15:42.031
- There we go!

1:15:42.066 --> 1:15:42.999
- To present your
oral testimony.

1:15:43.034 --> 1:15:44.572
- The guy we all came here for.

1:15:44.607 --> 1:15:46.497
- A few things I am not.

1:15:46.532 --> 1:15:50.677
I am not a cat, I am not
an institutional investor.

1:15:50.712 --> 1:15:53.614
- I love that he started
by saying, I am not a cat.

1:15:53.649 --> 1:15:57.178
- My favorite line of the
day was from Roaring Kitty.

1:15:57.213 --> 1:15:59.587
And he said, I am not a cat.

1:15:59.622 --> 1:16:01.446
- There was a reference
to a Zoom call

1:16:01.481 --> 1:16:03.921
where somebody in court
was looking like a cat

1:16:03.956 --> 1:16:05.054
with a filter.

1:16:05.089 --> 1:16:06.088
- I'm here live.

1:16:06.123 --> 1:16:07.089
I'm not a cat.

1:16:09.665 --> 1:16:11.764
- As for me, I liked the stock.

1:16:11.799 --> 1:16:13.524
- He liked the stock.

1:16:13.559 --> 1:16:15.064
- I would be the
first to acknowledge

1:16:15.099 --> 1:16:17.462
that investing in stocks and
options is incredibly risky.

1:16:17.497 --> 1:16:19.607
And it's so important for people

1:16:19.642 --> 1:16:22.566
to do their own thorough
research before investing.

1:16:22.601 --> 1:16:25.536
- He was more professional
than these billionaires.

1:16:25.571 --> 1:16:27.615
- Yes, yes or no?

1:16:27.650 --> 1:16:29.474
Yes or no, Lizzie,
are you gonna do this?

1:16:29.509 --> 1:16:31.652
- There's an actually
more complicated answer--

1:16:31.687 --> 1:16:33.049
- Yes or no?!

1:16:33.084 --> 1:16:34.622
- It's a more complicated
answer than that.

1:16:35.691 --> 1:16:37.625
- Yes or no, yes or no!

1:16:37.660 --> 1:16:39.451
- Are you a cat, Joe?
Are you a cat?

1:16:40.619 --> 1:16:42.630
- So yes or no, are
you buying the stock?

1:16:42.665 --> 1:16:44.192
- For me personally, yes.

1:16:45.525 --> 1:16:48.493
- He is literally moving
the needle right now

1:16:48.528 --> 1:16:49.967
like straight up.

1:16:50.002 --> 1:16:50.836
It's crazy.

1:16:55.139 --> 1:16:57.172
- Roaring Kitty, Keith Gill,

1:16:57.207 --> 1:16:58.569
made it publicly known

1:16:58.604 --> 1:17:02.540
that he doubled down
his position that day.

1:17:04.049 --> 1:17:05.576
- [Male Speaker] The
congresspeople all thought

1:17:05.611 --> 1:17:06.478
this was over.

1:17:07.283 --> 1:17:08.755
I knew it wasn't over.

1:17:08.790 --> 1:17:11.692
That was just the first inning.

1:17:11.727 --> 1:17:14.024
- The battle between
GameStop investors

1:17:14.059 --> 1:17:16.026
and the short
sellers is raging on.

1:17:16.061 --> 1:17:18.666
And this week, the short
sellers are losing again.

1:17:20.032 --> 1:17:21.592
- We can't have anyone
freak out out there, okay?!

1:17:21.627 --> 1:17:23.935
We've gotta keep our composure!

1:17:23.970 --> 1:17:25.706
We've gone too far!

1:17:25.741 --> 1:17:27.774
There's too much to lose!

1:17:27.809 --> 1:17:29.105
♪ We want the stock ♪

1:17:29.140 --> 1:17:30.678
♪ We want the stock ♪

1:17:30.713 --> 1:17:32.141
♪ Yes, we want the stock ♪

1:17:32.176 --> 1:17:34.143
♪ We want GameStop ♪

1:17:34.178 --> 1:17:37.212
- Actually, we've
got it right here,

1:17:37.247 --> 1:17:39.544
the original OGs, right?

1:17:39.579 --> 1:17:40.644
Look at us.

1:17:40.679 --> 1:17:42.019
Roaring Kitty had
made this poster

1:17:42.054 --> 1:17:44.120
using "Avengers: Endgame."

1:17:44.155 --> 1:17:49.092
He photoshopped all the OG's
photos into the characters.

1:17:52.768 --> 1:17:57.100
And so it turns out that it
ended up being his endgame.

1:17:59.665 --> 1:18:02.974
- Keith Gill, otherwise
known as Roaring Kitty

1:18:03.009 --> 1:18:05.240
and another name online,

1:18:05.275 --> 1:18:07.979
he did increase his
stake in the company

1:18:08.014 --> 1:18:09.849
by out to 50,000 shares.

1:18:09.884 --> 1:18:13.644
He's now up to 200,000
shares of GameStop,

1:18:13.679 --> 1:18:16.284
and that is valued at
33 million dollars now.

1:18:19.190 --> 1:18:21.861
- DeepFuckingValue
makes his final post.

1:18:24.096 --> 1:18:25.227
- He likes the stock.

1:18:26.934 --> 1:18:27.900
- Cheers, everyone.

1:18:32.467 --> 1:18:37.404
- Ryan Cohen tweeted out fist
bump after his final post.

1:18:38.704 --> 1:18:40.176
- I have not heard from
Roaring kitty since the squeeze

1:18:40.211 --> 1:18:41.716
and I don't know anyone who has.

1:18:43.214 --> 1:18:46.149
- He does post cat
pictures on Twitter.

1:18:49.385 --> 1:18:52.287
- I'd love to talk about
other prospective investments,

1:18:52.322 --> 1:18:54.091
and see what he's
thinking about markets,

1:18:54.126 --> 1:18:56.621
and just shoot the shit
with my friend again.

1:18:57.657 --> 1:19:01.164
(upbeat electronic music)

1:19:03.069 --> 1:19:06.301
(rocket exploding)

1:19:06.336 --> 1:19:09.139
- Wall Street Bets never
stopped talking about GameStop.

1:19:10.307 --> 1:19:11.702
After the squeeze,
people are like,

1:19:11.737 --> 1:19:13.374
oh, there's gonna
be another squeeze.

1:19:13.409 --> 1:19:15.981
I want to see the
price keep going up.

1:19:16.016 --> 1:19:18.709
- Is that possible?
Sure, it's possible.

1:19:18.744 --> 1:19:19.743
Bad bet.

1:19:19.778 --> 1:19:20.612
Could happen.

1:19:20.647 --> 1:19:21.954
Not a great bet.

1:19:21.989 --> 1:19:23.087
I thumb that one down.

1:19:25.157 --> 1:19:28.796
- Now, some believe
that all the juice

1:19:28.831 --> 1:19:30.831
has not been squeezed,

1:19:30.866 --> 1:19:32.591
but they use the term squoze.

1:19:32.626 --> 1:19:34.769
Has the squeeze been squozed?

1:19:37.873 --> 1:19:41.072
- My point when I say
squeeze has been squozed is,

1:19:41.107 --> 1:19:42.172
let's look at the data.

1:19:42.207 --> 1:19:43.844
- Is the squeeze squozed?

1:19:43.879 --> 1:19:45.978
- The squeeze has squozed.

1:19:46.013 --> 1:19:47.738
- Is the squeezed squozed?

1:19:47.773 --> 1:19:50.818
- It's turned into a
gigantic cult almost online.

1:19:50.853 --> 1:19:55.482
- Had the squeeze been
squozed and the answer is no.

1:19:58.058 --> 1:20:01.686
- The current data
show massively reduced
short interest.

1:20:08.464 --> 1:20:13.104
What's funny is when
I voice an opinion,

1:20:13.139 --> 1:20:16.635
I am called out as a
quote hedgie shill.

1:20:18.144 --> 1:20:19.880
The big issue is the people

1:20:19.915 --> 1:20:21.882
that are putting massive
sums of their wealth,

1:20:21.917 --> 1:20:23.114
money they've earned,

1:20:23.149 --> 1:20:24.313
in the hopes of
just making it rich,

1:20:24.348 --> 1:20:26.953
and that's not investing.

1:20:26.988 --> 1:20:28.185
- There are many reasons

1:20:28.220 --> 1:20:30.121
why the squeeze has
not been squozed yet.

1:20:30.156 --> 1:20:31.716
- The game of squeeze
hasn't happened.

1:20:31.751 --> 1:20:36.424
It could be valued
at $7 trillion.
- Whew.

1:20:38.934 --> 1:20:41.198
- What's unique about
GameStop for me personally

1:20:41.233 --> 1:20:45.037
is it evolved from a deep value
and loved physical retailer

1:20:45.072 --> 1:20:48.975
to a potential
e-commerce growth story.

1:20:49.010 --> 1:20:52.407
- To see GameStop run up
to such incredible levels,

1:20:52.442 --> 1:20:54.739
it makes you start to
wonder what comes next.

1:20:54.774 --> 1:20:56.411
- Let's put it this way.

1:20:56.446 --> 1:20:59.887
If GameStop is successful
at making a turnaround,

1:20:59.922 --> 1:21:04.155
and the stock ends up having
a valuation of $10 billion,

1:21:04.190 --> 1:21:05.387
$7 billion,

1:21:05.422 --> 1:21:07.719
let's call it
double where it was,

1:21:07.754 --> 1:21:09.094
that puts the stock
significantly lower

1:21:09.129 --> 1:21:10.359
than where it is today.

1:21:10.394 --> 1:21:12.691
And that's with the
successful turnaround.

1:21:12.726 --> 1:21:13.824
- We'll know within
the next year

1:21:13.859 --> 1:21:15.331
if GameStop can
be the next Chewy,

1:21:15.366 --> 1:21:16.200
and I think it will be.

1:21:16.235 --> 1:21:17.399
- Ryan Chewy.

1:21:17.434 --> 1:21:18.235
- You've got it.

1:21:18.270 --> 1:21:19.368
Yes.

1:21:19.403 --> 1:21:21.040
You've gotta bet on him, right?

1:21:21.075 --> 1:21:24.505
And you gotta bet on
the Chewy.com model.

1:21:24.540 --> 1:21:27.013
- People are basing daily trades

1:21:27.048 --> 1:21:29.950
off of whether Ryan
Cohen tweets or not.

1:21:29.985 --> 1:21:32.513
- And what's funny about it
is if you're a short seller,

1:21:32.548 --> 1:21:35.021
you don't know
what the hell like,

1:21:35.056 --> 1:21:37.056
what does a poop emoji mean?

1:21:37.091 --> 1:21:38.288
- Oh, so it's like a, what,

1:21:38.323 --> 1:21:40.026
like some form of
a Rosetta stone.

1:21:40.061 --> 1:21:42.127
He's gonna put this
out and that out,

1:21:42.162 --> 1:21:44.756
and then it's gonna be
the great plan, right?

1:21:44.791 --> 1:21:47.858
It's Professor Plum with the
wrench in the conservatory.

1:21:47.893 --> 1:21:48.793
Oh, that's great!

1:21:48.828 --> 1:21:50.432
The company is going to 500.

1:21:51.897 --> 1:21:53.369
Whatever.

1:21:53.404 --> 1:21:57.142
- It's a McDonald's
ice cream cone.

1:21:57.177 --> 1:21:58.869
- [Male Speaker] Just like that,

1:21:58.904 --> 1:22:02.675
GameStop after hours
absolutely fucking crushes it.

1:22:03.909 --> 1:22:05.876
- Ryan Cohen voted
in as chairman.

1:22:05.911 --> 1:22:07.449
That's a big step
for the company.

1:22:11.587 --> 1:22:13.290
- They've been
making a lot of hires

1:22:13.325 --> 1:22:14.918
of technology oriented bets

1:22:14.953 --> 1:22:16.557
ever since the agreement

1:22:16.592 --> 1:22:18.823
between Ryan and the
company was reached.

1:22:18.858 --> 1:22:20.099
- His vision is
to fire everybody

1:22:20.134 --> 1:22:22.530
and bring in buddies
from various websites.

1:22:23.929 --> 1:22:26.567
- He's bringing in an
all star cast of players

1:22:26.602 --> 1:22:28.239

doing it for passion.

- They hired a few
Amazon executives

1:22:46.952 --> 1:22:47.951

that's great,

1:22:47.986 --> 1:22:48.919

1:22:48.954 --> 1:22:50.030
if you want to find a company

it's vindicated.

1:23:17.917 --> 1:23:20.951

1:23:36.936 --> 1:23:38.309
- Finally, we get to the point

1:23:38.344 --> 1:23:42.511
where the actual
reputable professional

1:23:42.546 --> 1:23:45.250

1:23:54.096 --> 1:23:57.097

1:23:57.132 --> 1:23:58.560
excited investor base.

1:23:59.629 --> 1:24:01.101
- What's happening with GameStop

1:24:01.136 --> 1:24:03.026
isn't just about this company

1:24:03.061 --> 1:24:04.995
and it's not just
about the stock market.

1:24:05.030 --> 1:24:06.370
It's a much bigger reaction

1:24:09.144 --> 1:24:11.870
Think populism comes
to Wall Street.

1:24:11.905 --> 1:24:13.036

1:24:13.071 --> 1:24:15.082
- I was at Occupy Wall Street.

1:24:15.117 --> 1:24:18.679
- And today, we are at the
Reoccupy Wall Street event.

1:24:18.714 --> 1:24:21.418

happening again,

1:24:21.453 --> 1:24:22.683
I was like, oh my God,

1:24:22.718 --> 1:24:24.520
I cannot believe
this is going on.

1:24:24.555 --> 1:24:25.950
- This is class warfare.

1:24:25.985 --> 1:24:28.425
I'm going to call this
Occupy Wall Street 2.0.

1:24:28.460 --> 1:24:33.430

hoped for actually happening,

1:24:33.465 --> 1:24:35.795
which is rare.

1:24:37.271 --> 1:24:39.700

isn't just gonna forget.

1:24:41.275 --> 1:24:43.209
