I don't want to take over
the blacksmith shop.

00:34.852 --> 00:36.220

46:22.544 --> 46:24.247
So, Pip, are you
in love with her yet?

46:25.016 --> 46:27.521
I told you, my intention
is not to fall in love.

46:28.122 --> 46:30.326
MISS HAVISHAM: Love is not
always the result of intention.

46:30.994 --> 46:31.996
Do you love her?

46:36.438 --> 46:37.473
Well...

46:37.942 --> 46:39.978
then you must do more
to impress her.

46:49.632 --> 46:50.834
Clothes that fit
a gentleman.

46:52.003 --> 46:53.472

I give you.

46:53.472 --> 46:54.608
I give that money
to my family.

46:55.409 --> 46:56.444
Oh, Pip.

46:58.382 --> 46:59.317

Now a man.

47:03.626 --> 47:04.828
So kind.

47:06.431 --> 47:07.433
Kiss me.

47:09.471 --> 47:10.472
What?

47:11.642 --> 47:13.078
Just here on my cheek.

47:29.077 --> 47:31.314
Now buy yourself
a new suit of clothes with this.

47:39.364 --> 47:42.136

ever produced by China.

47:47.515 --> 47:50.452
Go to the docks and sell it
for no less than £6.

47:52.390 --> 47:54.629
For £6, you will be able
to buy a suit of clothes

47:54.629 --> 47:55.897
that will impress
any woman.

it is at all possible

that Miss Estella
might love me?

Come here in clothes that hide
the blacksmith's boy you were

48:16.038 --> 48:17.941
beneath the gentleman
you will become.

48:20.580 --> 48:21.916
Then you can ask
about love.

48:31.702 --> 48:32.704
Go.

48:43.526 --> 48:45.229
Take particular care
with the shoes.
