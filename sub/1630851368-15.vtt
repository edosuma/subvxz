get into the final,

03:41.155 --> 03:42.621
Let's make [bleep] happen.

03:42.690 --> 03:46.325
Teamwork is everything, and
we can't have one bad apple,

03:46.393 --> 03:48.694

the whole entire team up.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.496

04:02.743 --> 04:03.976
- It's a cape.
- Okay.

04:04.044 --> 04:07.679
- Because every team
needs a hero.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.881
- Yeah.
- And I'm not a superhero,

04:09.950 --> 04:11.783
but I'm gonna fake it
until I make it.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.985
- Okay.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.087
- Because this team needs
a lot of renovation.

04:15.155 --> 04:18.223
- Yeah.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.525
- Okay, listen, guys,
I feel like I saw the final.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.960
I saw it what that team--

04:22.029 --> 04:23.662
I was like, we are gonna
[bleep] win. We dominate.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.398
But if I came back
into this house and cried,

04:26.467 --> 04:28.233
every other person
on this--in this house

04:28.302 --> 04:29.935
would look at our team
and laugh at us.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.838
We can't think like that.
We're a team now, you know?

You've been to a final.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.168
I've been to a final.

05:03.237 --> 05:06.471
We have as many finalists
on this team as Emerald does.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.106
- We have more finalists--

05:08.175 --> 05:10.509
- We have more finalists on
this team than Sapphire does.

05:10.577 --> 05:11.877
- Mm-hmm.
- Yep.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.579
- We have potential.
I look at these guys.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.348
I [bleep] trust them.
I know you can do it.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.617
And you've gone the distance,
and you've proven yourself.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.353

<i> the best</i>

05:22.656 --> 05:24.156

but, Tori, you've been
on Ruby Cell for five minutes.

05:27.728 --> 05:30.429
We've been here
for five daily missions.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.231
Trust me, it's hell.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.268
- With that being said,
we all need to do our part.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.904
If we don't do our part, then
we're not winning tomorrow,

05:38.972 --> 05:40.906
and we might as well kiss
that final goodbye.

05:40.974 --> 05:44.276
- Yeah.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.378
- Oh, Mandy.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.113
You're always
stirring [bleep] up.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.382
You've been wanting to be green
for a while.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.817
- 'Cause you know
what green is?

05:51.885 --> 05:54.553
The color of money.
And I'm here for money.

05:54.621 --> 05:56.121
- Good.
You better put everything

05:56.190 --> 05:57.756
into this [bleep], because...

05:57.825 --> 05:59.191
- Then you better welcome me
with open [bleep] arms.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.426
- If you came--Tori ran [bleep]
30 laps with me outside.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.661
You better wake your ass
up in the morning

06:02.730 --> 06:04.096
and start [bleep]
running with me.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.697
- That's not what I do.
- I know you have heart.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.199
- And guess what.
The final is not about running.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.000
It's about checkpoints.
It's about being smart.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.535
So you better be lucky that
you got me instead of Tori,

06:10.604 --> 06:12.237
'cause I'm way smarter
than her.

06:12.306 --> 06:14.139
- I know you're good.
I've competed with you before.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.042
Even though we lose Tori,
Amanda's our strategic player.

06:17.111 --> 06:18.944
She is very good
at puzzles and math.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.679
The only thing that
I'm worried about is,

06:20.748 --> 06:22.080
how is she gonna work
with our team?

06:22.149 --> 06:24.616
I wanted to stay with my team,

we need to make it work, right?

06:26.286 --> 06:27.619
- Yeah, you better.
- There's no turning back now.
