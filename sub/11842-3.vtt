IT WAS THE EQUIVALENT

A STRAY LAMB BACK INTO THE FOLD,

WOULD END THE RELATIONSHIP.

38:09.025 --> 38:11.680
FATHER ED
WOULD SAVE LARUE'S SOUL.

38:11.724 --> 38:13.856

EXPECTED CONTRITION,

NOT A MILLION-DOLLAR
SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH

38:16.511 --> 38:20.254

POSSESSED BY GREED.

OF WHAT HE CONSIDERED TRUE EVIL,

38:24.389 --> 38:28.131
THE PRIEST ORDERED LARUE
TO TAKE HER DISCOVERY AND LEAVE.

FOR SO MANY YEARS,

IT WOULD BE THE LAST LOOK

LED LARUE TO TAKE HER OWN LIFE.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.717

TAKE THE TRUTH ABOUT LARUE?

39:02.165 --> 39:03.558

EVERY SWEET SOUL HERE.

LUCKILY, THIS PARTICULAR SINNER
HAD A SILVER LINING --

39:09.608 --> 39:13.394
FOR ALL HER WICKEDNESS,
LARUE WAS A FUNGAL GENIUS.

AND HOW, WHEN THINGS GOT MESSY,
