Oh!                             

05:46.379 --> 05:48.112
             Now let me put it  
                 this way.      

05:48.114 --> 05:49.780
            And let me          
            put it this way.    

05:49.782 --> 05:53.517
    Listen, I hate to           
     interrupt you, but if      
      we don't get going,       

05:53.519 --> 05:55.653
    we'll miss the beginning    
        of the picture.         

05:55.655 --> 05:56.654
Oh, yeah.                       
Come on, Michael.               

05:56.656 --> 05:58.289
Gloria, I was                   
just thinking.                  

05:58.291 --> 06:01.492
Uh, maybe we shouldn't          
go to the movies tonight.       

06:02.828 --> 06:04.929
                But, Michael,   
            it's Saturday night.

06:04.931 --> 06:08.399
Oh, big deal!                   
Saturday night.                 

06:08.401 --> 06:11.569
Gloria, it's only               
lonely, unfulfilled people      

06:11.571 --> 06:14.672
who have to go out              
just because it's               
Saturday night.                 

06:14.674 --> 06:16.607
When two people                 
love each other,                

06:16.609 --> 06:20.178
any night of the week           
can be Saturday night.          

06:20.180 --> 06:21.579
                But, Michael,   
             I've been cooped up

06:21.581 --> 06:23.147
                    at the store
                all day long,   

06:23.149 --> 06:25.149
              and I've really   
            been looking forward
        to going out tonight.   

06:25.151 --> 06:27.952
    We really ought to be going.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.021
         Uh, Ma, just a second. 
            Excuse me, please.  

06:30.023 --> 06:31.589
            Gloria...           

06:31.591 --> 06:33.591
             think about it.    

06:38.030 --> 06:41.232
              We have the house 
              all to ourselves. 

06:41.234 --> 06:42.566
              The two of us.    

06:42.568 --> 06:44.635
        You and me, alone.      

06:44.637 --> 06:46.270
            Mike and Gloria.    

06:46.272 --> 06:48.006
                Together.       

06:48.008 --> 06:49.640
                Alone.          

06:49.642 --> 06:52.243
        Together. Alone.        

06:52.245 --> 06:53.744
    Well--                      

06:53.746 --> 06:55.146
            And you know what   
              I just remembered?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.714
             You know what's    
              on TV tonight?    
     No.                        

06:56.716 --> 06:57.848
               <i>Citizen Kane.</i>    

06:57.850 --> 06:59.450
     Tonight?                   
                    Yeah!       

06:59.452 --> 07:00.885
     Really?                    
                That's right!   

07:00.887 --> 07:02.887
Oh, Ma. You go ahead            
and go without us.              

07:02.889 --> 07:04.122
We're gonna                     
stay home tonight.              

07:04.124 --> 07:07.791
             I think Mike wants 
        to be alone with you.   

07:09.561 --> 07:12.563
             <i>Citizen Kane</i>       
        is on tomorrow night.   

07:12.565 --> 07:14.132
I know.                         

07:16.402 --> 07:18.202
            Oh, well, bye, Mike!

07:18.204 --> 07:19.904
Oh.                             
Bye, Mom!                       

07:19.906 --> 07:22.073
    And watch out               
  for that Frank Lorenzo.       

07:22.075 --> 07:23.441
        All right.              

07:23.443 --> 07:25.176
              Oh, Mike!         

07:30.782 --> 07:33.084
             Honey, I'm so glad 
             you thought of it, 

07:33.086 --> 07:34.485
            'cause <i>Citizen Kane</i> 
              is supposed to be 

07:34.487 --> 07:36.287
            one of the really   
                  great movies  
                  of all time.  

07:36.289 --> 07:37.888
                 So why don't   
              you turn on the TV

07:37.890 --> 07:39.090
                  and I'll be   
            right down, okay?   

07:39.092 --> 07:40.191
Uh, where are                   
you going?                      

07:40.193 --> 07:41.792
             I'm going upstairs 
            to take off the wig.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.761
No! I mean...no.                

07:43.763 --> 07:45.263
Why don't you                   
leave it on?                    

07:45.265 --> 07:47.631
        Well, I don't need it on
              to watch TV.      

07:47.633 --> 07:50.401
B-but think how much fun        
it'll be, Gloria,               

07:50.403 --> 07:51.635
sitting home                    
and watching television         

07:51.637 --> 07:55.339
with a glamorous,               
dark-haired movie star.         

07:55.341 --> 07:56.907
                Okay, Michael.  
              Come on, sit down.

07:58.177 --> 07:59.877
                  [SIGHS]       

07:59.879 --> 08:01.745
             Oh, will you please
            turn on the TV?     

08:01.747 --> 08:03.013
  What for?                     

08:03.015 --> 08:06.551
    Well, it'll be easier       
        to see <i>Citizen Kane</i>     

08:06.553 --> 08:08.052
     if the television set's on.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.053
         Oh, yeah.              

08:09.055 --> 08:11.722
  Uh, well...it's not on yet.   

08:11.724 --> 08:13.857
        Oh, well, what time     
          does it come on?      

08:13.859 --> 08:16.860
    Uh...not tonight.           

08:16.862 --> 08:17.861
                        What?   

08:17.863 --> 08:19.263
Uh, don't get mad,              
Gloria.                         

08:19.265 --> 08:20.798
                     Michael,   
                 you tricked me!

08:20.800 --> 08:21.899
Gloria, I just wanted           

08:21.901 --> 08:24.102
for the two of us               
to be alone, that's all.        

08:24.104 --> 08:25.703
         Well, why'd you have to
                lie to me?      

08:25.705 --> 08:28.239
The truth wasn't                
working so good.                

08:28.241 --> 08:29.273
                  Get lost, you!

08:29.275 --> 08:31.675
I know, I know.                 
You're right, Gloria.           

08:31.677 --> 08:33.910
The truth is                    
you're my wife                  
and I love you,                 

08:33.913 --> 08:35.313
and, like I said,               

08:35.315 --> 08:38.416
I just wanted for               
the two of us                   
to be alone, that's all.        

08:38.418 --> 08:40.884
I'm-- I'm sorry                 
I lied to you.                  

08:40.885 --> 08:42.086
         Well, that's all right,
                  Michael.      

08:42.087 --> 08:43.953
    We can watch <i>Citizen Kane</i>   
             tomorrow night.    

08:43.956 --> 08:47.125
Well, Gloria, don't try         
to make me feel bet--           

08:47.127 --> 08:48.559
Tomorrow night?                 

08:48.561 --> 08:50.561
                Yeah. That's    
                when it's on.   

08:50.563 --> 08:52.163
                I marked it here
                 in the <i>TV Guide</i>

08:52.165 --> 08:53.731
            'cause I didn't want
                 to miss it.    

08:53.733 --> 08:56.767
Gloria! You mean,               
you knew <i>Citizen Kane</i>           
wasn't on tonight?              

08:56.769 --> 08:58.136
                    Yeah.       

08:59.371 --> 09:01.405
So why did you let me           
go on like that,                

09:01.407 --> 09:02.706
making a fool                   
out of myself?                  

09:02.708 --> 09:05.143
          'Cause you were saying
          such beautiful things.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.477
You tricked me!                 

09:06.479 --> 09:07.845
                  That's right! 

09:07.847 --> 09:08.846
Oh, Gloria!                     
I'll kill you!                  

09:08.848 --> 09:11.149
            Your trick was worse
            than my trick,      

09:11.151 --> 09:12.550
                because you knew
              and I didn't know.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.152
            And what's worse,   
         you knew I didn't know!

09:14.154 --> 09:15.153
Michael,                        
calm down,                      
calm down!                      

09:15.155 --> 09:16.354
                Don't tell me   
                to calm down!   

09:16.356 --> 09:18.156
            Not until I tell you
            what I have to!     

09:18.158 --> 09:20.224
         Last one up the stairs 
            is a rotten egg.    

09:20.226 --> 09:21.359
      No!                       

09:32.571 --> 09:33.837
     Hey, Gloria.               

09:33.839 --> 09:35.839
what's taking you               
        so long?                

09:35.841 --> 09:37.408
                 I'm brushing   
                    my teeth!   

09:37.410 --> 09:38.842
    Oh. Well,                   
      hurry it up!              

09:38.844 --> 09:40.911
              I'll be right in, 
                    honey!      

09:59.331 --> 10:00.731
  Sorry I took so long, honey.  

10:00.733 --> 10:02.200
     Oh, that's all right.      

10:04.303 --> 10:06.270
  Gloria, wh-what did you do?   

10:06.272 --> 10:08.506
  I don't know. What did I do?  

10:08.508 --> 10:10.241
     You took off the wig!      

10:10.243 --> 10:12.710
        Oh, yeah, sure.         
I'm not gonna sleep in it.      

10:12.712 --> 10:15.779
Yeah, but, honey...             

10:15.781 --> 10:17.381
  Honey, you look               
  so cute in it.                

10:17.383 --> 10:19.617
          Well, don't you think 
         I look cute without it?

10:19.619 --> 10:22.253
Oh, sure, sure.                 
You look beautiful.             

10:22.255 --> 10:23.821
            Oh, tell me more.   

10:23.823 --> 10:29.159
You know, I can't               
get over how cute               
you looked in that wig.         

10:29.161 --> 10:31.095
                I'm glad, honey.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.097
        I didn't think          
you were gonna like it.         

10:33.099 --> 10:34.665
         Are you kidding me?    

10:34.667 --> 10:37.301
                I loved it!     
                 It's beautiful!

10:37.303 --> 10:38.436
                 Put it on.     

10:39.971 --> 10:42.373
  No, honey, 'cause I have to   
    pin my hair and wrap it.    

10:42.375 --> 10:44.041
          It's a net.           
    It takes too long.          

10:44.043 --> 10:45.175
          I can wait.           

10:46.511 --> 10:48.746
Come on, Michael,               
come to bed.                    
My feet are cold.               

10:48.748 --> 10:51.982
        Wait, wait, Gloria.     
Just a second. Just a second.   

10:51.984 --> 10:54.685
              Do it for me, huh?
                 Just for me.   

10:54.687 --> 10:55.886
                 Put the wig on,
                    huh?        

10:55.888 --> 10:58.356
             I-It makes you look
            so...different.     

10:59.491 --> 11:00.524
        Different.              

11:00.526 --> 11:02.793
  Makes me look so different.   

11:02.795 --> 11:04.629
    Michael, I may be slow,     

11:04.631 --> 11:07.831
        but it's finally        
     getting through to me.     

11:07.833 --> 11:09.066
I only appeal to you            

11:09.068 --> 11:10.534
     when I have this           
     dumb wig on!               

11:10.536 --> 11:11.535
                     Gloria,    
                that's not true.

11:11.537 --> 11:12.670
Michael, it's not me.           

11:12.672 --> 11:14.071
It's this pile of hair          
from Kressler's                 

11:14.073 --> 11:15.873
that's getting                  
to you.                         

11:15.875 --> 11:17.608
I just happen to be             
standing underneath it.         

11:17.610 --> 11:19.943
Gloria, how can you             
say that?                       

11:19.945 --> 11:22.179
That's not true!                
I love you with                 
or without the wig.             

11:22.181 --> 11:23.447
It's just that...               

11:23.449 --> 11:25.616
  right now,                    
  I'd like you                  
  with the wig.                 

11:25.618 --> 11:26.950
                 Sure you would!

11:26.952 --> 11:28.051
            Because that way,   

11:28.053 --> 11:29.687
            you can mess around 
        with a different girl   

11:29.689 --> 11:32.657
            without cheating    
                on your wife!   

11:32.659 --> 11:34.458
                What a sickie!  

11:34.460 --> 11:37.395
You're calling me               
a sickie, Gloria?               

11:37.397 --> 11:38.396
      You're the sick one!      

11:38.398 --> 11:40.030
         You're jealous         
        of your own wig!        

11:47.205 --> 11:50.808
    All I know is that          
         you're in love         

11:50.810 --> 11:52.976
    with the fantasy figure     
        with dark hair.         

11:52.978 --> 11:55.613
     No! No, that's not true.   
  I'm in love with you, Gloria. 

11:55.615 --> 11:56.814
        Look, I wanna           
        show you something.     

11:56.816 --> 11:58.349
         Look at this.          
    Look at this here.          

11:58.351 --> 11:59.650
          You know what this is?

11:59.652 --> 12:02.653
          Here, it's a whole    
      tray full of fantasy here.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.854
                  And look what 
                you've got here.

12:03.856 --> 12:05.790
                  Perfumes,     
            lipsticks, mascaras,

12:05.792 --> 12:06.990
            blue eye shadow,    
             green eye shadow...

12:06.992 --> 12:09.760
                false eyelashes.

12:09.762 --> 12:11.562
            And what is all this
              here for, Gloria? 

12:11.564 --> 12:13.564
              All to make you   
          more attractive to me.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.265
            So why should you   
                 mind the wig?  

12:15.267 --> 12:17.735
         Gee, honey, what are we
              arguing about?    

12:17.737 --> 12:19.136
             Come on, put it on.

12:21.206 --> 12:23.073
    No!                         
                        Why not?

12:23.075 --> 12:26.276
  I'm not gonna be              
  the other woman               
  in my own marriage!           

12:26.278 --> 12:28.512
            Honey, you're not   
            making any sense.   

12:28.514 --> 12:30.247
Oh, yes, I am,                  
Michael!                        

12:30.249 --> 12:32.950
        It's not me you're      
        attracted to...it's her!

12:32.952 --> 12:35.919
        Well, the three of us   
            are not gonna share 
             this bed tonight!  

12:35.921 --> 12:38.121
              I don't even think
            I wanna share it    
                with you!       

12:38.123 --> 12:39.223
     Oh, okay!                  

12:39.225 --> 12:40.825
If that's what you want,        
     Gloria, fine.              

12:40.827 --> 12:42.360
      That's okay.              
I'll sleep on the couch.        

12:42.362 --> 12:44.695
                Good night!     
Michael, wait!                  
Wait!                           

12:44.697 --> 12:46.797
Don't forget                    
your girlfriend.                

12:49.634 --> 12:52.035
     I hope the two of you      
      will be very happy!       

13:05.083 --> 13:07.551
        Good morning, Gloria.   

13:07.553 --> 13:09.052
Good morning.                   

13:09.054 --> 13:12.423
  If you're looking for Mike,   
         he ain't here.         

13:12.425 --> 13:13.724
I wasn't looking for him.       

13:13.726 --> 13:15.426
          Where'd he go?        

13:15.428 --> 13:18.128
He went for a walk in the park. 

13:18.130 --> 13:19.329
        I hope he gets mugged...

13:20.932 --> 13:21.932
                         Gloria.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.368
  ...by someone wearing a wig.  

13:24.370 --> 13:27.705
        Gloria, I'll fix you    
            a nice breakfast.   

13:27.707 --> 13:29.339
        Then you'll feel better.

13:29.341 --> 13:31.174
        No, thanks, Ma.         
         I have no appetite.    

13:31.176 --> 13:34.512
                  Oh, it was    
             the same with Mike.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.847
                 He only ate    
             two pieces of bacon

13:36.849 --> 13:40.183
        and he hardly touched   
            his third egg.      

13:40.185 --> 13:42.286
[SARCASTICALLY]                 
Oh, the poor thing.             

13:42.288 --> 13:45.222
                 Well, he was   
             very upset, Gloria.

13:45.224 --> 13:48.459
            He told me about you
            and him and the wig.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.862
                Gloria,         
             I don't understand.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.932
            What did he do      
        that made you so mad?   

13:56.601 --> 13:58.702
Ma, how would you feel?         

13:58.704 --> 14:01.639
I put on the wig,               
and something came over him.    

14:01.641 --> 14:03.140
He became sensuous              

14:03.142 --> 14:05.108
  and demanding                 
  and passionate.               

14:05.110 --> 14:06.444
  It was terrible.              

14:07.579 --> 14:09.447
                I must have     
             missed something.  

14:09.449 --> 14:12.215
                 What was

14:59.331 --> 15:02.332
            Jeez, that's        
         a swell greeting I get.

15:02.334 --> 15:04.034
        What's the matter?      
        Anything wrong with you?

15:04.036 --> 15:07.805
         I've seen happier faces

I'm fine.                       

15:08.875 --> 15:09.907
Did you have                    

15:09.909 --> 15:11.141
a good time                     
at your convention?             

15:11.143 --> 15:12.710
    Oh, yeah! We had--          

15:12.712 --> 15:14.111
      Well, yeah, but that      
        ain't the reason        

15:14.113 --> 15:16.580
that we go to conventions,      
 to have a good time, you know. 

15:16.582 --> 15:18.916
        We've got a lot         
of important things to do.      

15:18.918 --> 15:20.551
         Edith, get coffee, huh?
                            Yes.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.387
             So, yeah,          
        while we're there,      
      we welcome new members.   

15:23.389 --> 15:26.390
        We go to meetings.      
      we attend them there,     

15:26.392 --> 15:27.892
          what do you call...   

15:27.894 --> 15:29.259

  the bleeding-heart liberals,

                Oh, yeah.       
              Yeah, sure, Edith.

15:53.419 --> 15:54.518
                    We had      
                a little fun.   

15:54.520 --> 15:56.020
        You know, just before   
                lights out,     

15:56.022 --> 15:59.456
              bend a few elbows,
              have a few laughs.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.724
                  I tell you,   
            there's this guy,   

16:00.726 --> 16:02.259
                Jerry Cromwell, 
            from Jersey City,   
                you know.       

16:02.261 --> 16:04.628
               He got himself   
        one of these electric   
            cattle prods.       

16:04.630 --> 16:06.597
              He'd get into     
         the elevator, you know.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.666
         He introduced himself  
    to the ladies from behind   

16:08.668 --> 16:11.869
                with a little   
                 whoops, eh?    

16:11.871 --> 16:16.173
Didn't he do                    
the same thing                  
last year?                      

16:16.175 --> 16:18.809
                 Yeah, Edith,   
              he always does it.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.411
         That's, er, what do you
        call it? Tradition.     

16:21.413 --> 16:22.813
                    I mean,     
            that's what makes   

16:22.815 --> 16:25.148
        the military what it is.
            Tradition.          

16:26.751 --> 16:28.485
Sounds like a million laughs.   

16:28.487 --> 16:29.987
     Now, listen, little girl...

16:29.989 --> 16:33.423
     we do just what we done    
      overseas there in WW2.    

16:33.425 --> 16:35.025
         Come back after        
      a hard day's fighting,    

16:35.027 --> 16:38.228
    you need a few laughs       
     to break up the monogamy.  

16:41.199 --> 16:42.766
            That's what         
    these conventions do.       

16:42.768 --> 16:44.301
    They break up monogamy.     

16:44.303 --> 16:49.673
 Some fun. A bunch of old goats 
 molesting unsuspecting women.  

16:49.675 --> 16:51.709
    Ah, come on, now! Hey!      

16:51.711 --> 16:53.677
     There was no molesting, eh.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.313
          Nobody laid a hand    
        on nobody else.         

16:56.315 --> 16:57.547
    Just every now and then,    

16:57.549 --> 17:00.084
    a little electric whoops    
            with the prod.      

17:02.053 --> 17:03.520
          It's a little         
          innocent fun.         

17:03.522 --> 17:04.922
        And them old goats      
    you're talking about        

17:04.924 --> 17:06.123
 are just like your father here.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.290
      They're happy married men.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.326
Happily married men?            

17:09.328 --> 17:11.962
    Don't you tell me           
about happily married men.      

17:11.964 --> 17:14.665
Happily married men             
are the worst lechers           
     in the world.              

17:14.666 --> 17:16.066
      I should know,            

17:16.068 --> 17:18.201
      'cause I'm married        
to a happily married man.       

17:18.203 --> 17:19.869
                 What the hell's
                 this all about?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.505
    I don't wanna               
    talk about it!              

17:21.507 --> 17:23.107
                    You just    
                talked about it!

17:23.108 --> 17:24.608
          Will you              
      leave me alone?           

17:24.609 --> 17:26.542
                         [MOANS]

17:26.545 --> 17:29.379
                It's that time  
             of the month again,
                     huh?       

17:35.854 --> 17:37.287
No, Archie.                     

17:37.289 --> 17:39.790
Mike and Gloria                 
had a fight,                    

17:39.792 --> 17:42.225
and he walked out               
of the house.                   

17:43.895 --> 17:48.132
  You ain't just telling that   
 to make me feel good, are you? 

17:48.134 --> 17:49.867
          Archie!               

17:49.869 --> 17:50.868
                      All right,
                      all right.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.736
            Well, what happened,
                anyway?         

17:52.738 --> 17:54.104
                     Give me    
                the whole story.

17:54.106 --> 17:56.573
                 But don't make 
            any detours, huh?   

17:56.575 --> 17:58.809
              Just give it to me
            short and sweet.    

17:58.811 --> 18:00.477
         All right.             

18:00.479 --> 18:03.080
 Mike fell in love with a wig.  

18:11.422 --> 18:13.991
  I didn't believe it neither,  
        but that's what         

18:13.993 --> 18:17.327
      Gloria said he did,       
    and she was there.          

18:25.870 --> 18:29.239
You see,                        
Gloria bought                   
this wig,                       

18:29.241 --> 18:32.542
and when she put it on,         
she looked beautiful.           

18:32.544 --> 18:34.411
Mike loved her                  
in it.                          

18:34.413 --> 18:36.980
         Well, what's the matter
                with that?      

18:36.982 --> 18:40.818
Well, there's more,             
but I can't                     
talk about it.                  

18:43.554 --> 18:46.289
                 Force yourself,
                      huh?      

18:48.993 --> 18:50.794
  Well...                       

18:50.796 --> 18:54.765
Mike wanted her                 
to wear the wig when...         

18:56.801 --> 18:58.268
  When...                       

19:01.539 --> 19:04.908
Well, you know what             
married people do...            

19:04.910 --> 19:06.810
 sometimes.                     

19:15.053 --> 19:16.686
Oh, here he is,                 
huh?                            

19:16.688 --> 19:18.321
Here's the--                    
Wait a minute!                  

19:18.323 --> 19:19.522
Where do you think              
you're going?                   

19:19.524 --> 19:21.524
                  To talk       
                  to Gloria.    
Oh, no, no.                     

19:21.526 --> 19:24.228
Hey! Hey, Gloria,               
the meathead's back!            

19:24.230 --> 19:26.130
Lock your door!                 

19:27.331 --> 19:29.233
    My daughter                 
    don't wanna                 

19:29.235 --> 19:31.235
    talk to you,                
you hair lover.                 

19:33.905 --> 19:35.605
              I thought you were
            still in the city   

19:35.607 --> 19:38.275
             making Times Square
             safe for democracy.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.077
I want to                       
talk to you, though!            

19:40.079 --> 19:43.313
Well, well, well.               
Look who's here.                

19:43.315 --> 19:45.883
  Did you decide to come back   
to finish your third egg?       

19:45.885 --> 19:47.151
                 Gloria, I wanna
                    talk to you.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.552
                 Hey, hey,      
          did he eat three eggs?

19:51.990 --> 19:53.556
                    Gloria,     
              for the past hour,

19:53.558 --> 19:55.225
              I've been walking 
             around in the park.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.627
      Arm in arm with a wig?    

19:57.629 --> 20:01.031
                Will you stay   
            out of this, please?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.432
            I've been walking   
                  in the park   

20:02.434 --> 20:03.533
                feeling terribly
                     guilty     

20:03.535 --> 20:04.601
             about what happened
                 last night.    

20:04.603 --> 20:06.270
                Then suddenly   
                 it hit me.     

20:06.272 --> 20:08.138
              What am I feeling 
                guilty about?   

20:08.140 --> 20:09.873
                I mean,         
            what did I do wrong?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.075
    Will somebody please tell me
          what I did wrong?     

20:12.077 --> 20:14.278
        All I wanted to do      
    was make love to my wife.   

20:14.280 --> 20:16.880
                     Hey, hey!  
                Cut that out!   

20:16.882 --> 20:19.549
            Edith don't wanna   
                talk about that!

20:19.551 --> 20:23.053
    I ain't talking, Archie.    
      I'm just listening.       

20:24.455 --> 20:26.890
        Well, stifle yourself   
            and quit listening. 

20:26.892 --> 20:28.292
         Okay, Michael,         
if you're gonna talk about      

20:28.294 --> 20:31.195
        our private problems    
    in front of the whole world,

20:31.197 --> 20:33.130
        you might as well       
         tell 'em everything.   

20:33.132 --> 20:35.933
You wanted to make love to me   
    because I was wearing a wig.

20:35.935 --> 20:39.402
You, buddy,                     
are a weirdwolf.                

20:41.472 --> 20:43.540
             Gloria, why did you
                 buy the wig?   

20:43.542 --> 20:46.143
So I wouldn't have to shampoo   
    my hair every five minutes. 

20:46.145 --> 20:47.945
      No, now that is not       
        the only reason.        

20:47.947 --> 20:50.547
 You also know that you happen  
 to look very attractive in it. 

20:50.549 --> 20:52.349
  Well, I liked it. It worked.  

20:52.351 --> 20:53.616
        Worked?                 

20:53.618 --> 20:55.785
You need a dose of saltpeter    
    in your cornflakes!         

21:04.595 --> 21:07.397
          Michael...are you     
          actually saying       

21:07.399 --> 21:10.667
    that I'd turn myself        
        into a sex object       
        for your pleasure?      

21:10.669 --> 21:12.435
    Sometimes, yes.             
         The same way           

21:12.437 --> 21:14.137
      I try to make myself      
      attractive for you.       

21:14.139 --> 21:18.408
     How do you do that?        
  Put a bag over your head?     

21:18.410 --> 21:22.045
 Why don't you run down to the  
 post office and salute a flag? 

21:22.047 --> 21:24.281
If you go                       
with me!                        

21:26.284 --> 21:28.451
  Gloria, honey,                
  believe me.                   

21:28.453 --> 21:29.987
It wasn't the wig.              

21:29.989 --> 21:31.989
It was the fact that            
you were wearing the wig.       

21:31.991 --> 21:33.656
 That's what did it.            

21:33.658 --> 21:35.458
Gloria, remember the time       
I went shopping with you,       

21:35.460 --> 21:37.660
and you bought                  
that blue dress?                

21:37.662 --> 21:39.263
There were three other girls    
in that store                   

21:39.265 --> 21:40.364
trying on the same dress,       

21:40.366 --> 21:42.132
  but they didn't do            
  a thing for me.               

21:42.134 --> 21:44.167
But when you put it on,         
remember how I reacted?         

21:44.169 --> 21:46.203
             Yeah, you loved it.

21:46.205 --> 21:48.505
I didn't love                   
the dress, Gloria.              

21:48.507 --> 21:50.807
I loved you                     
in the dress.                   

21:50.809 --> 21:53.043
If I saw that dress             
on a hanger right now,          

21:53.045 --> 21:54.444
it wouldn't do a thing          
for me.                         

21:54.446 --> 21:56.513
     I'd like to see you        
on a hanger in the rain.        

21:58.316 --> 22:00.617
                MIKE:           
          Will you just stay out
             of this, please?   

22:00.619 --> 22:04.154
Gloria, don't you see           
what I'm trying to say?         

22:05.556 --> 22:07.157
It's-- It's not the object      
you're wearing.                 

22:07.159 --> 22:09.726
It's the fact that              
you're wearing it.              

22:12.763 --> 22:14.398
 I love <i>you,</i> Gloria.            

22:17.969 --> 22:20.070
        Did you get any sleep   
                last night?     

22:20.072 --> 22:21.972
        No.                     

22:21.974 --> 22:23.506
            Neither did I.      

22:23.508 --> 22:26.109
            I think I'm gonna go
             take a little nap. 

22:29.180 --> 22:31.148
             I think I will too.

22:40.925 --> 22:42.392
                    A nap?      

22:42.394 --> 22:45.595
                  They think    
              they're fooling me
            with that stuff.    

22:45.597 --> 22:47.431
Oh, Archie.                     

22:47.433 --> 22:49.232
            Don't give me       
             the "Oh, Archie!"  

22:49.234 --> 22:50.667
            You're sitting here.
            You heard that.     

22:50.669 --> 22:53.103
          Did you get anything  
              out of that?      

22:53.105 --> 22:55.572
Oh, yeah. They're               
just like you and me.           

22:55.574 --> 22:57.841
                They ain't      
                like you and me!

22:57.843 --> 22:59.209
                     They ain't 
                    like nobody!

22:59.211 --> 23:00.210
     Oh.                        

23:00.212 --> 23:03.847
Yeah, Archie,                   
I remember one morning.         

23:03.849 --> 23:06.049
It was                          
11 years ago.                   

23:06.051 --> 23:07.650
 You came out                   
 of the bathroom                

23:07.652 --> 23:09.652
and you'd just                  
finished shaving.               

23:09.654 --> 23:11.754
 And you smelled                
 wonderful.                     

23:11.756 --> 23:14.391
  And I gave you                
  a big kiss.                   

23:14.393 --> 23:17.160
And ever since then,            
you made sure                   

23:17.162 --> 23:19.796
you smelled the same way        
every morning.                  

23:21.265 --> 23:24.234
                What has that   
            got to do with this?

23:24.236 --> 23:25.335
  Everything.                   

23:25.337 --> 23:28.705
I know how Mike feels           
about the wig.                  

23:28.707 --> 23:30.407
I feel the same way.            

23:30.409 --> 23:35.912
Because there's something       
about my Aqua Velva man.        

23:59.970 --> 24:03.640
 Archie, what do                
 you think?                     

24:04.775 --> 24:07.310
                  I think I need
                another beer.   

24:26.164 --> 24:30.367
