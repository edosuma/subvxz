        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:04.604 --> 00:05.938
        Hey, guys.              

00:06.039 --> 00:07.406
I brought in                    
some leftover birthday cake     

00:07.574 --> 00:08.941
        from the party.         

00:09.075 --> 00:11.276
     Thought you might like     
          to share it.          

00:11.344 --> 00:12.711
Whose birthday--                
one of your kids?               

00:12.812 --> 00:14.480
          Yeah, right.          
     You see a file in it?      

00:18.118 --> 00:22.788
             Today happens to be
    Elvis Presley's birthday.   

00:22.856 --> 00:24.490
                 Celebrating the
         birthday of a dead guy?

00:24.557 --> 00:25.858
                  That's kind of
             ghoulish, isn't it?

00:25.925 --> 00:27.926
      I don't know how you could
    stomach something like that.

00:27.994 --> 00:30.062
    It's double mocha           
     chocolate fudge.           

00:30.163 --> 00:33.565
          Long live the King.   

00:33.633 --> 00:36.902
 Those of us who keep the faith 
    believe that on this day    

00:36.970 --> 00:38.671
    he's going to make          
      his presence known.       

00:38.738 --> 00:40.506
Yeah, uh, how's                 
he going to do that?            

00:40.573 --> 00:41.740
CARLA:                          
Well, it could be               
anything--                      

00:41.808 --> 00:44.243
    song on the radio,          
      whisper in the wind,      

00:44.310 --> 00:47.012
         just something         
that unmistakably says "Elvis."

02:06.593 --> 02:08.727
Ah, good afternoon,             
Miss Tortelli.                  

02:08.794 --> 02:10.729
                     Oh, Hill.  

02:10.797 --> 02:12.865
                What, are you on
                  an ugly break?

02:12.932 --> 02:15.034
Oh, my.                         
Someone certainly got up        

02:15.101 --> 02:17.970
on the wrong side of town       
this morning.                   

02:20.707 --> 02:23.842
        What's the matter, Hill,
        your scalp on too tight?

02:27.414 --> 02:29.381
                Very funny.     

02:29.449 --> 02:31.483
              Free this evening?

02:31.551 --> 02:34.153
Just get it                     
through your hairy ears,        

02:34.220 --> 02:35.521
whatever happened               
between us                      

02:35.588 --> 02:37.690
was strictly                    
a seven-night stand.            

02:37.757 --> 02:39.625
                    Oh...       

02:39.693 --> 02:41.560
You're forgetting...            

02:41.628 --> 02:45.764
    All right, seven nights, two
lunch breaks, and a bus ride.   

02:45.832 --> 02:49.735
I love slumming with you.       

02:49.803 --> 02:51.337
                      Well, just
                      forget it.

02:51.404 --> 02:53.872
    Today is Elvis' birthday,   
         and I'm not interested.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.574
                Get out of here.

02:55.642 --> 02:57.710
    Okay, but if you change     
        your mind,              

02:57.777 --> 03:00.112
 you know where you can get me. 

03:00.180 --> 03:02.981
        Good Lord,              
  do you know where to get me.  

03:04.684 --> 03:06.352
             Woof!              

03:08.521 --> 03:10.789
      I can't believe it.       

03:10.857 --> 03:12.491
What is it, Sam?                

03:12.559 --> 03:13.692
    (clearing throat):          
             Oh...              

03:13.760 --> 03:15.794
          Tony, my hairstylist--

03:15.862 --> 03:19.264
  he's making a left on Boylston
    and this bus cut him off.   

03:19.332 --> 03:20.399
            Car jumped the curb,

03:20.467 --> 03:22.034
             and he slammed into
              this hot dog stand

03:22.102 --> 03:23.535
             and ended up in the
              middle of the pond

03:23.603 --> 03:25.070
                in the public   
                        gardens.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.573
        He's at the hospital now
        with two broken legs.   

03:27.640 --> 03:30.109
                Got to cancel my
            hair appointment.   

03:33.146 --> 03:36.448
            I hate it when stuff
        like that happens to me.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.017
(door opens)                    

03:38.184 --> 03:39.651
        Greetings, all.         

03:39.753 --> 03:41.253
I have a brief                  
announcement.                   

03:41.321 --> 03:42.988
    You may recall last year    

03:43.056 --> 03:45.224
          I brought in          
 my dysfunctional men's group.  

03:45.291 --> 03:46.325
Well, unfortunately,            

03:46.393 --> 03:47.760
my low self-esteem group        
heard about it                  

03:47.827 --> 03:49.395
and now they think              
they're not good enough.        

03:51.564 --> 03:53.365
 So you're bringing them here?  

03:53.466 --> 03:55.601
    Well, I'd like the group    
    to get used to a normal,    

03:55.669 --> 03:57.336
  healthy, social environment.  

03:57.404 --> 03:59.605
 So you're bringing them here?  

03:59.673 --> 04:01.040
  Look, all I'm asking, guys,   

04:01.107 --> 04:04.176
     is that you treat them     
    as if they were at home.    

04:04.244 --> 04:07.246
You know, they've all been      
wounded and they're vulnerable, 

04:07.313 --> 04:09.248
        and, well, the truth is,

04:09.315 --> 04:12.017
    you'll never find           
a sadder group of people.       

04:12.085 --> 04:13.352
Oh, yeah?                       

04:13.453 --> 04:15.087
How about                       
the Donner party?               

04:15.155 --> 04:17.755
Well, you know, they-they       
got lost in the mountains       

04:17.824 --> 04:19.858
and had to watch                
their limbs freeze off          

04:19.926 --> 04:21.293
while they ate each other.      

04:22.395 --> 04:24.430
    Well, you caught me.        

04:24.497 --> 04:27.766
    Cannibalism <i>is</i> sadder       
    than low self-esteem.       

04:29.469 --> 04:31.503
                Carla, what's   
                    the date?   

04:31.571 --> 04:32.905
Don't you know?                 

04:33.006 --> 04:34.873
(chuckling):                    
Rebecca, on this date           

04:34.974 --> 04:39.144
            in 1935,            
 Elvis Aaron Presley was born.  

04:39.212 --> 04:41.013
A man who was destined          

04:41.081 --> 04:43.215
      to change the shape       
    of popular music.           

04:43.283 --> 04:45.751
    A man who captured          
     the hearts of America.     

04:45.819 --> 04:47.486
        A man who,              
      through his music...      

04:47.554 --> 04:48.954
Can I have my drink?            

04:52.225 --> 04:55.661
...taught us all                
the meaning of love.            

04:56.930 --> 04:58.997
         Listen, I have         
a question for you, Tony.       

04:59.065 --> 05:01.633
    Uh, are your arms broken    
            as well,            

05:01.701 --> 05:04.603
or is it j-just the legs?       

05:04.671 --> 05:06.338
  Just the legs are shattered.  

05:06.406 --> 05:08.707
        (quietly):              
        All right!              

05:08.775 --> 05:10.109
Say, all right, Tony,           

05:10.210 --> 05:12.411
maybe if I showed up there      
    with some scissors          

05:12.479 --> 05:15.180
I could lean over the bed       
         and y... Tony?         

05:15.248 --> 05:17.783
Tony, don't-don't pass out      
          on me, man.           

05:17.851 --> 05:18.884
        Hello?                  

05:18.952 --> 05:20.552
        Who's this?             

05:20.620 --> 05:22.021
      You're his nurse?         

05:22.088 --> 05:23.188
  Ah, great.                    

05:23.256 --> 05:26.792
Listen, honey, do you           
cut hair by any chance?         

05:26.860 --> 05:28.594
  Hello? Shoot!                 

05:29.629 --> 05:31.864
     I hate this.               

05:31.931 --> 05:36.201
I can hear the little hairs     
scraping along my collar.       

05:36.269 --> 05:39.505
Can you hear that,              
or is that just me?             

05:40.907 --> 05:43.175
         Hey, Sam, why don't you
        let me cut your hair?   

05:43.243 --> 05:45.144
      (laughs)                  

05:45.245 --> 05:46.745
    (snorts)                    

05:46.813 --> 05:48.814
That's cute, man,               
that's very funny.              

05:48.882 --> 05:51.517
Took my mind off                
my hair there                   
for a minute.                   

05:53.219 --> 05:54.286
        No, Sam, I'm serious.   

05:54.354 --> 05:55.821
        I-I'm pretty good at it.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.790
            I cut Dr. Crane's   
                      hair once.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.726
Yes, uh, he did, and I must say 
    he did an excellent job.    

06:00.794 --> 06:02.795
No, I don't know,               
Woody, I don't know.            

06:02.862 --> 06:04.396
        Sam, look, all right,   

06:04.464 --> 06:07.399
      let me just trim the back,
just to get it off the collar   

06:07.467 --> 06:09.234
            so you don't have   
                to listen to it.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.438
                So <i>we</i> don't have
                to listen to it.

06:12.505 --> 06:14.340
SAM:                            
All right, just                 
the back, though.               

06:14.441 --> 06:16.041
This is what                    
we're gonna need:               

06:16.109 --> 06:18.444
sterile                         
tungsten steel scissors,        

06:18.511 --> 06:22.448
English bone comb,              
36 to 39 tines,                 

06:22.515 --> 06:24.817
and a conditioner               
with a pro-vitamin              

06:24.884 --> 06:26.919
B-5 keratin complex.            

06:26.986 --> 06:28.120
         Got that?              

06:28.188 --> 06:31.890
                 And this little
              tool of the trade.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.934
Take the bowl                   
off the head.                   

06:42.002 --> 06:45.304
                     (laughing):
                Sam, it's just a
            little barber humor.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.372
                    (chuckles)  

06:46.439 --> 06:47.940
                     Come on!   

06:48.008 --> 06:49.074
        No, it's, like, uh...   

06:49.142 --> 06:51.477
              All right, what do
              you say to someone

06:51.544 --> 06:53.379
              who just had their
                ears lowered?   

06:53.446 --> 06:55.247
Oh, darn, I blew the joke.      

06:55.315 --> 06:57.249
All right...                    

07:07.027 --> 07:08.594
                      Step down.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.730
                      Step down.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.833
                      Step down.

07:17.537 --> 07:19.138
                        Hi.     

07:23.009 --> 07:26.078
Wouldn't you know,              
it's always the one that        
talks big in the office.        

07:28.548 --> 07:30.883
    Oh, that's right,           
      that's his ride. Oh.      

07:30.950 --> 07:33.786
      Well, all right, uh,      
  the rest of you, uh, mingle.  

07:33.853 --> 07:35.187
            (chuckles)          

07:35.255 --> 07:38.657
                No, no. Boys,   
                what we're doing
            here is huddling.   

07:38.725 --> 07:41.493
You do know the difference      
 between huddling and mingling? 

07:41.561 --> 07:42.995
                     (mumbling):
        I know how to mingle.   

07:43.063 --> 07:44.563
     I just don't want to mingle
    with people I don't know.   

07:44.631 --> 07:46.331
Yes, that's right, Lester.      
        (chuckles)              

07:46.399 --> 07:47.833
            Frasier, I didn't   
            quite catch that.   

07:47.901 --> 07:49.401
 Truth be told, neither did I.  

07:49.469 --> 07:52.137
  I haven't understood a thing  
 the poor sap's said in years.  

07:52.205 --> 07:53.806
                         LILITH:
                        Frasier,

07:53.873 --> 07:56.942
I must restate my objection     
to your bringing them here.     

07:57.010 --> 07:59.244
As I've said previously,        
this is an extremely risky      

07:59.312 --> 08:01.280
and somewhat                    
frivolous experiment,           

08:01.381 --> 08:03.182
which could have                
negative repercussions.         

08:03.249 --> 08:06.018
            Oh, Wilma, loosen up
              the bone a little!

08:06.086 --> 08:08.420
This is an uncontrolled         
environment                     

08:08.488 --> 08:10.622
which could easily              
get out of hand.                

08:10.690 --> 08:12.624
And who's this Wilma?           

08:14.494 --> 08:16.895
        Are you sure you know   
              what you're doing?

08:16.963 --> 08:18.397
I think so.                     

08:20.266 --> 08:23.035
        Oh, is that some        
     of your barber humor?      

08:23.103 --> 08:25.070
Come on, lighten up, Sam!       

08:35.315 --> 08:38.583
Say, where's your               
sense of humor, man?            

08:38.650 --> 08:40.519
      Whoo!                     

08:40.587 --> 08:41.787
Airplane ride?                  

08:41.855 --> 08:43.455
Whoo!                           

08:43.523 --> 08:44.957
         Don't, don't do that.  

08:45.025 --> 08:46.959
Round trip? Whoo!               

08:50.530 --> 08:51.563
                         So...  

08:51.631 --> 08:53.032
you from around here?           

08:53.099 --> 08:54.600
            Woody...            

08:54.668 --> 08:56.835
         just get to it,        
        will you, please?       

08:56.903 --> 08:58.637
Hey, suit yourself.             
    Same price.                 

08:58.705 --> 09:00.539
        (shaver buzzing)        

09:03.476 --> 09:05.277
It's all right, Sam. Okay.      

09:13.753 --> 09:18.023
    So, uh, you're the guys     
with low self-esteem, huh?      

09:19.459 --> 09:23.429
Yeah, well, luckily,            
I don't have that problem.      

09:23.496 --> 09:25.397
  But then again, how could I?  

09:25.465 --> 09:27.066
  What, with a cerebral cortex  

09:27.133 --> 09:29.968
  that's eight percent larger   
than the average human's.       

09:31.371 --> 09:33.605
          Don't look--          
        you can't tell.         

09:33.673 --> 09:37.676
    E-Excuse me, do you wear    
that mailman uniform every day? 

09:37.744 --> 09:38.744
        Yes, I do.              

09:38.812 --> 09:40.245
          And proudly.          

09:40.313 --> 09:41.780
 Do you live with your mother?  

09:43.950 --> 09:46.618
    Well, uh... yeah.           

09:46.686 --> 09:47.820
Yeah.                           

09:47.887 --> 09:50.356
     Hey, guys, it's Mr. X.     

09:53.360 --> 09:55.761
        Uh, gentlemen, let me   
         show you the pool room.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.730
                      (chuckles)
                        Quickly.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.398
      (quietly):                
  That's the guy...             

09:59.466 --> 10:00.866
                     Come along.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.268
              And that must be  
        Mr. X's fat friend,     

10:03.336 --> 10:05.371
             Mr. Y, at the end  
                of the bar!     

10:10.543 --> 10:12.845
        (shaver buzzing)        

10:12.912 --> 10:14.813
        (bubblegum pops)        

10:19.219 --> 10:21.353
    (shaver turns off)          

10:21.421 --> 10:23.522
          Oops.                 

10:23.590 --> 10:25.024
    What do you mean, "oops"?   

10:25.091 --> 10:26.692
     What's going on back there?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.127
    Oh, nothing, Sam.           

10:28.194 --> 10:30.396
Uh, say, when you came in,      

10:30.463 --> 10:33.499
    did you have...             
gum in your hair?               

10:34.834 --> 10:36.301
            No. Why?            

10:36.369 --> 10:37.770
    No reason.                  

10:37.837 --> 10:41.373
I'm just trying to pass         
    the time of day.            

10:41.441 --> 10:43.342
            Aw...               

10:43.410 --> 10:46.745
     Damn it, Woody, you got gum
    in my hair, didn't you?     

10:46.813 --> 10:48.981
Uh, no, no. Here, here.         

10:49.049 --> 10:51.116
        (shaver buzzing)        
        There.                  

10:51.184 --> 10:52.484
            Out.                

10:53.987 --> 10:55.554
            What's it look like?

10:55.622 --> 10:58.390
 It's got a lot of hair in it.  

10:58.458 --> 11:00.893
Give me that other mirror.      

11:02.295 --> 11:04.096
Give me the other mirror, Woody!

11:04.164 --> 11:05.664
                            SAM:
                          Woody!

11:24.417 --> 11:27.486
Want to go over and say hi,     
make 'em feel more at home?     

11:27.554 --> 11:30.356
             I don't know, those
             guys are wrapped up
                pretty tight.   

11:30.423 --> 11:32.324
      Who knows how loony       
        they could get?         

11:32.392 --> 11:33.759
    They might be dangerous.    

11:33.827 --> 11:35.260
    They might buy us a beer.   

11:35.328 --> 11:37.730
        I'll do anything        
to promote mental health.       

11:41.601 --> 11:44.503
So, uh, Wynken,                 
Blynken and Nod...              

11:44.571 --> 11:45.637
I know they're alive.           

11:45.705 --> 11:46.739
I can hear                      
them breathing.                 

11:46.806 --> 11:49.308
        Rebecca, give us        
      a pitcher, will you?      

11:49.376 --> 11:51.477
  (all chatting and laughing)   

11:55.515 --> 11:59.318
     So... uh, what are we      
      talking about here?       

11:59.386 --> 12:00.619
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Crane.       

12:00.687 --> 12:02.388
     We were kind of making     
        fun of somebody.        

12:02.455 --> 12:04.023
    Oh, no. No need             
    to be sorry.                

12:04.090 --> 12:05.424
     Listen, it's a             
perfectly healthy sign.         

12:05.492 --> 12:06.658
It, it means that               

12:06.726 --> 12:07.826
you're interacting,             

12:07.894 --> 12:09.294
that you're feeling             
better about yourselves.        

12:09.362 --> 12:12.297
So, uh, what were you           
saying about this poor sap?     

12:12.365 --> 12:13.632
        (laughter)              

12:13.700 --> 12:16.268
That he's a pompous fool.       

12:17.971 --> 12:19.705
  Oh, Cliff is just             
  trying to fit in.             

12:22.509 --> 12:24.443
              We weren't talking
                    about Cliff.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.345
                 We were talking
         about you... "egghead."

12:26.413 --> 12:28.180
        (laughter)              

12:29.582 --> 12:31.517
        Me?                     

12:31.584 --> 12:33.352
Hey, remember the time          
Fras fell asleep,               

12:33.420 --> 12:35.821
and we, we put his hand         
in that warm glass of water?    

12:37.290 --> 12:39.625
        That's the first time   
        I ever saw that work.   

12:40.960 --> 12:42.628
    Okay, we can                
    stop this now.              

12:42.696 --> 12:43.896
Hey, remember that time Carla   
        put the green,          

12:43.963 --> 12:46.732
        uh, marble              
     in his martini glass?      

12:46.800 --> 12:47.966
Carla did that?                 

12:48.034 --> 12:50.436
I broke a crown.                

12:50.503 --> 12:53.172
Well, how about the time he,    
he leaned over his mai tai      

12:53.239 --> 12:55.374
and, uh, poked his eye          
with the umbrella.              

12:55.442 --> 12:58.944
 Look, there is nothing amusing 
    about corneal abrasion.     

12:59.012 --> 13:03.082
        How about the time at   
    group when he leaned back   

13:03.149 --> 13:04.883
      in his chair to make      
    a dramatic gesture          

13:04.951 --> 13:05.918
      and he got stuck in       
      the venetian blinds.      

13:05.985 --> 13:07.119
NORM:                           
He did?!                        

13:07.187 --> 13:09.588
            Now that's funny.   

13:09.656 --> 13:10.989
    No it's not.                

13:11.057 --> 13:15.461
    Did you hear that? He       
    said, "No, it's snot."      

13:15.528 --> 13:17.129
        Oh, this is not         
        therapy.                

13:17.197 --> 13:19.198
    This is just                
    childish abuse.             

13:19.265 --> 13:21.133
      So we put an end          
      to it right here.         

13:21.201 --> 13:22.434
    This, this session          
    is over,                    

13:22.502 --> 13:24.970
 right now.                     

13:25.038 --> 13:28.707
      Remember, it's a fee      
         and a half...          

13:28.775 --> 13:31.377
because it's a field trip.      

13:34.714 --> 13:37.383
      Gee, maybe we should      
      go apologize to him.      

13:37.450 --> 13:38.550
He's charging you               
a fee and a half,               

13:38.618 --> 13:39.685
and you want to apologize?      

13:39.753 --> 13:41.053
    Well, what should we do?    

13:41.121 --> 13:42.554
        Pants him.              

13:42.622 --> 13:43.856
CLIFF:                          
There you go.                   
Yeah.                           

13:43.923 --> 13:45.991
     Yeah, let's pants him!     

13:46.059 --> 13:48.327
                Let's go for it!
Pants him.                      

13:48.395 --> 13:49.995
                     (chanting):
        Pants him. Pants him.   

13:50.063 --> 13:53.065
     Pants him. Pants him.      
    Pants him. Pants him...     

14:02.809 --> 14:04.376
        Hey, Sam.               

14:06.212 --> 14:08.013
Hey, Sam, I hope                
you're not still mad at me      

14:08.081 --> 14:09.515
about that haircut thing.       

14:09.582 --> 14:11.150
     Nice hat, by the way.      

14:11.217 --> 14:14.520
You know, my cousin Elmore had  
a hunting cap just like that.   

14:14.587 --> 14:16.622
     Of course he decorated     
     it with deer antlers.      

14:16.690 --> 14:17.890
     Big mistake.               

14:21.361 --> 14:24.296
            Sam... why aren't   
              you talking to me?

14:24.364 --> 14:26.198
                        Sam?    

14:26.266 --> 14:27.366
                          CLIFF:
                          Woody?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.268
                    I think he's
                ignoring you.   

14:30.737 --> 14:33.072
              Is that true, Sam?

14:33.139 --> 14:36.775
You know for a minute there     
I thought I heard something.    

14:36.843 --> 14:40.946
A little tiny voice of          
a nothing jerk bartender.       

14:42.816 --> 14:44.516
                      Me?       

14:44.584 --> 14:46.251
I think I was wrong.            

14:46.319 --> 14:49.254
I think it was just a tiny      
little insignificant bug.       

14:51.324 --> 14:52.725
            Well, that's very   
                      funny Sam,

14:52.792 --> 14:56.195
      but it's not a tiny little
              insignificant bug.

14:56.262 --> 14:59.098
             It's your assistant
     bartender-- good old Woody.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.671
            I think I got it.   

15:07.640 --> 15:10.376
      I can't believe it.       

15:10.443 --> 15:12.344
    I'm being shunned.          

15:13.813 --> 15:16.015
Just like back in Hanover.      

15:16.082 --> 15:19.418
Just like with the Amish.       

15:19.486 --> 15:21.053
                        NORM:   
                        Wood?   

15:21.121 --> 15:24.189
      Who, uh, who shunned      
      you back in Hanover?      

15:24.257 --> 15:27.126
  The Amish. Weren't you here   
         for this part?         

15:29.462 --> 15:32.164
Please, miss,                   
can I just have my beer?        

15:32.232 --> 15:36.201
            All right. I'm gonna
    give you one last chance,   
            and this is a gimme.

15:36.269 --> 15:40.706
  What was the year of Elvis'   
     big comeback special?      

15:40.774 --> 15:42.341
              '72.              

15:42.409 --> 15:44.943
        You're pathetic.        

15:45.011 --> 15:46.745
Hey, I paid for that beer.      

15:46.813 --> 15:48.981
     Well, then I guess you     
 just should have studied, huh? 

15:50.417 --> 15:52.851
    I hope we weren't           
    too hard on Fras.           

15:52.919 --> 15:55.287
    Well, his being ridiculed   
        in here is one thing,   

15:55.355 --> 15:57.923
    but out in public, that's   
          got to be humiliating.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.158
I know what you're saying.      
                        Yeah.   

15:59.225 --> 16:00.759
You know,                       
when I was a kid,               

16:00.827 --> 16:02.728
I was the first one             
in my class to...               

16:02.796 --> 16:05.431
you know, develop breasts.      

16:06.966 --> 16:08.767
 They teased me the whole year. 

16:08.835 --> 16:10.336
    Oh, yeah, me, too.          

16:14.174 --> 16:17.643
Yeah, I took my fair share      
of ribbing back in Hanover.     

16:17.711 --> 16:18.711
                        Yeah?   

16:18.778 --> 16:21.146
"Little Einstein"               
they called me.                 

16:23.817 --> 16:25.918
"Mr. Smarty Pants."             

16:25.985 --> 16:27.753
    "Brainiac."                 

16:27.821 --> 16:30.456
Yep. I've heard 'em all.        

16:30.523 --> 16:32.891
      Before I die, I got       
    to see that town.           

16:38.531 --> 16:39.999
So what about you, Cliff?       

16:40.066 --> 16:41.700
                     Well, sorry
            I can't help you.   

16:41.768 --> 16:42.901
                Happy childhood.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.837
      Well-adjusted, well-liked.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.171
            Class valedictorian.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.940
                    I'd show you
                    my yearbook,

16:48.008 --> 16:49.708
but Ma apparently thought       

16:49.776 --> 16:51.477
    some of the inscriptions    
        were off-color.         

16:52.712 --> 16:55.781
          So she made me eat it.

16:55.849 --> 16:59.151
         Nope. No problems here.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.389
                      Hey, Fras.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.023
      Don't "Hey Fras" me.      

17:05.090 --> 17:06.759
    After the way you people    
         behaved today,         

17:06.826 --> 17:08.861
     you're lucky I am even     
        speaking to you.        

17:08.928 --> 17:11.363
How dare you treat me like that 
    in front of my patients!    

17:11.431 --> 17:14.800
    I have been your friend,    
        your confidante,        

17:14.867 --> 17:18.971
your unpaid therapist           
for years.                      

17:19.039 --> 17:20.772
            And how do you show 
              your gratitude?   

17:20.839 --> 17:22.340
             By humiliating me, 
             by making me a...  

17:22.409 --> 17:23.876
             a laughingstock.   

17:23.943 --> 17:26.912
    Come on, Fras, those guys   
    were scared stiff of you.   

17:26.980 --> 17:29.081
         That's why they weren't
            getting anywhere.   

17:29.149 --> 17:31.817
    We were just trying to bring
    you down a peg, you know?   

17:31.885 --> 17:34.119
Yeah, come on, Fras,            
 you've got to admit, uh,       

17:34.187 --> 17:36.488
sometimes you get up            
on that high horse of yours.    

17:36.556 --> 17:38.991
High horse?!                    
Well, I never.                  

17:42.062 --> 17:44.530
                 Oh, God,       
            Lilith was right.   

17:44.597 --> 17:45.764
            Bringing those      
            patients here       

17:45.832 --> 17:48.000
        was the worst thing I've
        ever done in my life.   

17:48.068 --> 17:51.637
     This entire affair has been
        an unmitigated disaster.

17:51.705 --> 17:53.305
Hey look, there's Dr. Crane.    

17:53.373 --> 17:54.506
                      Dr. Crane.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.742
         We figured out what you
            were doing today,   

17:56.810 --> 17:58.444
                     and thanks.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.212
            I beg your pardon?  

18:00.280 --> 18:01.313
                  Well, you were
                      letting us

18:01.381 --> 18:03.115
            do all that stuff   
            to you just so we   

18:03.183 --> 18:04.216
            could feel better   
                about ourselves.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.684
          What a guy.           

18:05.752 --> 18:07.219
    You know, you've really     
          got to care           

18:07.287 --> 18:08.487
        to go that far.         

18:08.555 --> 18:11.890
              How about that.   

18:11.958 --> 18:14.293
        They <i>have</i>               
     figured it out.            

18:14.361 --> 18:16.395
            (chuckles)          

18:16.463 --> 18:18.330
                This is the best
              group we ever had.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.531
          (laughing):           
         Yeah, well...          

18:19.599 --> 18:21.533
                 (mumbling):    
                  ...genius.    
     Oh, well,                  

18:21.601 --> 18:22.634
    I wouldn't really           
     say "genius," Lester.      

18:22.702 --> 18:23.902
That is what you said, isn't it?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.473
     Gentlemen, good night.     

18:27.540 --> 18:29.008
Good night.                     
                      Thank you,
                      Dr. Crane.

18:29.075 --> 18:32.077
You've all made wonderful       
        progress today.         

18:32.145 --> 18:35.014
                      Thank you,
                      Dr. Crane.
      Thank you very much.      

18:35.081 --> 18:36.749
              You know, maybe in
                a hundred years,

18:36.816 --> 18:39.084
              they'll be able to
            walk through a mall.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.486
                        FRASIER:
                            Bye.

18:40.553 --> 18:44.523
              So, you all caught
                a little glimpse

18:44.591 --> 18:47.226
                into the life of
                Frasier Crane...

18:47.293 --> 18:49.661
                      M.D., PhD.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.631
             Try not to think of
              me any differently

18:52.699 --> 18:55.434
                 now that you've
    witnessed my unique gift.   

18:55.502 --> 18:57.836
      You see, although I wasn't
    completely aware of it,     

18:57.904 --> 19:00.606
              I intuited        
        what those men needed   

19:00.674 --> 19:02.741
        and I gave it to them,  
    freely and of myself...     

19:02.809 --> 19:05.911
for I am a healer.              

19:05.979 --> 19:08.681
That is what I do.              

19:09.783 --> 19:12.551
         And we                 
     are pantsers.              

19:12.619 --> 19:14.720
                         That is
                     what <i>we</i> do.

19:14.788 --> 19:16.221
            Oh, no.             

19:16.289 --> 19:17.222
     No, fellas, not again.     

19:17.290 --> 19:19.425
                No, no, these   
                  are new pants!

19:35.742 --> 19:39.011
                Sam, I've really
                 enjoyed the way

19:39.079 --> 19:43.082
          you've been pretending
    I'm a bug and everything.   

19:43.149 --> 19:45.651
                But I'm not a   
                 bug; I'm Woody.

19:55.161 --> 19:57.496
         Sam, where I come from,
            we have a saying,   

19:57.564 --> 19:59.131
            "An eye for an eye."

19:59.199 --> 20:01.200
                The point being,
                      of course,

20:01.267 --> 20:02.634
                 you're supposed
            to shave my head,   

20:02.702 --> 20:04.203
        not shave out my eye.   

20:05.305 --> 20:07.006
        (buzzing)               

20:07.073 --> 20:08.507
    Oh, man.                    

20:08.575 --> 20:09.842
This is stupid.                 
         (buzzing stops)        

20:09.909 --> 20:11.276
I don't want                    
to cut your hair.               

20:11.344 --> 20:12.311
                      You don't?

20:12.379 --> 20:13.946
    No.                         

20:14.014 --> 20:16.148
              So you forgive me?

20:16.216 --> 20:18.083
 Yeah, let's just just forget   
    about the whole thing,      

20:18.151 --> 20:19.718
all right?                      

20:19.786 --> 20:23.022
                 That... that is
                real noble, Sam.

20:23.089 --> 20:26.258
I mean, here I wrecked          
your hair,                      

20:26.326 --> 20:28.293
your... your beautiful,         
beautiful hair,                 

20:28.361 --> 20:31.163
the one thing you care most     
about in the whole world,       

20:31.231 --> 20:33.065
and yet, you're willing         
to forgive me.                  

20:33.133 --> 20:34.600
I mean, you know,               

20:34.668 --> 20:36.368
every time you look             
in the mirror,                  

20:36.436 --> 20:38.437
you're gonna be reminded        
of what I did to you,           

20:38.505 --> 20:41.273
and yet, you say                
it's okay.                      

20:41.341 --> 20:43.375
I have never                    
liked you more                  

20:43.443 --> 20:46.178
than I do                       
right now, Sam...               

20:46.246 --> 20:48.480
ridiculous haircut              
and all.                        

20:50.583 --> 20:53.919
              Woody, come in the
                 office with me,

20:53.987 --> 20:55.354
              just for a second.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.022
Sure, why?                      

20:57.090 --> 20:58.323
        No reason.              

20:58.391 --> 21:01.160
        (buzzing)               

21:02.896 --> 21:04.963
              Carla, it's almost
            midnight-- any sign?

21:05.031 --> 21:06.465
(sighs)                         

21:06.533 --> 21:08.734
Not one                         
blue suede shoe.                

21:08.802 --> 21:12.371
I guess Elvis                   
has disappointed me again.      

21:12.439 --> 21:15.307
         Well, I'm sure the King
    had a lot of other people   

21:15.375 --> 21:17.643
      to visit around the world.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.981
Yeah, well, he isn't            
showing up here                 

21:23.049 --> 21:24.316
or anywhere else tonight.       

21:24.384 --> 21:25.551
(blowing)                       

21:25.618 --> 21:28.687
    Uh, I have flowers          
      for a Miss Tortelli.      

21:28.755 --> 21:30.856
     That's me.                 

21:30.924 --> 21:31.990
Here you go.                    

21:32.058 --> 21:34.660
                     Oh. Thanks.

21:37.931 --> 21:39.198
            "Carla,             

21:39.265 --> 21:41.500
"I wonder if you're             
lonesome tonight.               

21:41.568 --> 21:42.534
The King."                      

21:42.602 --> 21:44.069
                     (gasps)    
Oh, my God.                     

21:44.137 --> 21:45.871
              Oh!               

21:45.939 --> 21:47.206
        I knew it.              

21:47.273 --> 21:48.941
        I knew... I knew        
    he'd come through.          

21:49.009 --> 21:50.409
I knew he wouldn't let me down. 

21:50.477 --> 21:52.578
But just a minute ago, you know,
  you started to doubt that...  

21:52.645 --> 21:54.480
I did not doubt.                
I never doubted.                

21:56.383 --> 21:57.750
I'm going home, Becs.           

21:57.817 --> 21:59.785
I'm going home.                 
I'm gonna stay up all night.    

21:59.853 --> 22:02.654
I'm gonna listen to every record
        Elvis ever made,        

22:02.722 --> 22:04.356
     even "In the Ghetto."      

22:07.627 --> 22:10.229
Uh, Miss Howe, did Miss Tortelli
        get the flowers?        

22:10.296 --> 22:11.497
                Yes, she did.   

22:11.564 --> 22:12.898
            In fact, she just   
              ran up the stairs.
     Ah.                        

22:12.966 --> 22:14.566
      Did you send those?       

22:14.634 --> 22:16.101
          Yes, I did,           

22:16.202 --> 22:18.470
      but those were just       
         for starters.          

22:18.538 --> 22:22.207
This will really push her       
         over the edge.         

22:32.719 --> 22:34.353
        (buzzing)               

22:34.421 --> 22:35.854
         (door opening)         

22:37.290 --> 22:38.657
 Woody, what was that buzzing?  

22:38.725 --> 22:41.293
      Sam, with the razor.      

22:41.361 --> 22:43.996
                 Well, your hair
                 looks the same.

22:44.064 --> 22:46.365
It's the only hair I have left.
