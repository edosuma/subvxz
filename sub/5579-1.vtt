No, that's quite all right.

We have a lot of girls
to go through today.

01:13.006 --> 01:15.340
Thank you for coming in.

01:15.375 --> 01:17.476
- I was up all night practicing.
- I'm sure you were.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.470

Do you mind me asking
what I did wrong?

01:37.797 --> 01:39.131
Okay.

01:39.165 --> 01:43.502
Um, first off,
your song choice.

01:43.536 --> 01:45.337
I thought it was original.

01:45.371 --> 01:47.873
I bet you did, and so did
five other girls this morning,

01:47.907 --> 01:49.675
even if you did
sing it the best.

01:49.709 --> 01:51.410

<i>To be brutally honest

01:54.447 --> 01:57.049

01:57.083 --> 01:58.717
Name recognition
is all that matters,

01:58.751 --> 02:01.620

<i>We need a star, not another

02:05.925 --> 02:07.593
Why did you agree to see me?

02:07.627 --> 02:09.928
Apparently your fiance's
very well-connected,

02:09.963 --> 02:12.998
and someone called in a favor
and is wasting my time.

02:15.835 --> 02:16.902

Your taste is so on point.

Sweetie, I'm just saying this

but I doubt
they carry your size.

03:31.477 --> 03:35.614

Hey, there.
You looking for somebody?

04:01.641 --> 04:03.775
Do you know Will LaSalle?

04:03.810 --> 04:05.644
You don't mean
<i>the</i> Will LaSalle?

So, Heidi, why don't you
follow me to the Delta party,

04:18.825 --> 04:21.093
and maybe we'll find
Will along the way?

04:21.127 --> 04:22.394
I need another drink.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.963
- I got something better.
- What?

04:24.998 --> 04:28.567
Tonight's entertainment is
brought to you by the letter K.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.235

First round's on me.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.476
What about you?

04:37.510 --> 04:39.978
Sampling your own wares
is bad for business.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.981
Plus, coach would kill me.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.216

04:54.560 --> 04:55.794
Heidi, let's just go.

04:55.828 --> 04:56.762
I have to tell him.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.430
Just... just meet me outside.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.498
I'll be right out.

<i>Are you sure?</i>

05:02.035 --> 05:03.435
Okay.

05:06.406 --> 05:08.273
Thank you so much.

05:14.947 --> 05:16.648
Hi, Camille.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.150
Hi, Poppy.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.584
If you're looking for Will,

05:19.619 --> 05:22.087
he disappeared upstairs
with Annabel.

05:22.121 --> 05:23.555
You know, you should really
put a leash on him

05:23.589 --> 05:25.157
until he learns how to behave.

05:36.703 --> 05:37.669
<i>Will?</i>

05:37.704 --> 05:39.137
Oh, great.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.706
Why haven't you
called me back?

05:40.740 --> 05:42.574
I don't think you get it.

05:42.608 --> 05:43.942
It was a one-time thing.

05:43.976 --> 05:45.911
Yeah, you made
that pretty clear, but,

05:45.945 --> 05:48.080
look, we have to talk alone.

05:48.114 --> 05:51.983
Uh, Roderick, my good man,
happy belated birthday.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.985
Thanks, homie,
but you know I don't wear

05:54.020 --> 05:55.454
anything from the Goodwill.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.448
- Get off of me.
- Hey, take a hint.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.827
Get out of here.
Fine.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.662
I'll just go talk to Camille
then,

06:03.696 --> 06:06.098
see what she thinks about
your extracurricular activities.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.434
Uh, you keep your mouth
shut to Camille.

06:09.469 --> 06:12.371
Hey, if you mess that up,
I swear to God

06:12.405 --> 06:15.073
I'll make that scholarship
of yours disappear.

06:15.108 --> 06:17.209
<i>I hear that
Gateway Community College</i>

06:17.243 --> 06:19.211
has a great liberal arts
program.

06:19.245 --> 06:21.847
Get away from
the ledge, Heidi.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.283
Whoa, don't tease us now.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.065
What are you doing?

06:40.099 --> 06:42.701
Hey, babe, you're back.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.870
Just having a little chat,
right, Heidi?

06:44.904 --> 06:46.805
Okay, well, she's drunk,

06:46.839 --> 06:48.607
and you're not sober, so...

06:48.641 --> 06:50.008
Cam, don't be mad.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.777
We're just having a little fun.

06:51.811 --> 06:52.711
Heidi, do you want
to come down?

06:52.745 --> 06:53.912
I'll walk you home.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.314
That'd be great.
Thanks.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.616
Hey, where do you
think you're going?

06:57.650 --> 07:00.185
Get off of me.

07:00.219 --> 07:01.499
Oh, my God.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.025
Do you think we should call
the cops or something?

07:07.059 --> 07:08.627
Sure, Rick,

07:08.661 --> 07:09.828
<i>and then you can tell them
about that medication</i>

07:09.862 --> 07:10.962
<i>you prescribed her too.</i>

07:10.997 --> 07:12.164
<i>Well, what should we do?</i>

07:12.198 --> 07:13.465
Well, it was an accident,

07:13.499 --> 07:15.100
so we could just walk away,
right?

07:15.134 --> 07:17.702
<i>She got drunk at the party.</i>

07:17.737 --> 07:18.970
She wandered up here by herself.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.238
She broke through that door,
and...

07:20.273 --> 07:22.073
<i>And then she accidentally fell.</i>

07:22.108 --> 07:23.948
- Fine with me.
- Yeah, me too.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.114
<i>Cam?</i>

07:29.148 --> 07:30.148
Cam, let's go.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.905
Are you okay?

07:53.940 --> 07:55.774
She's dead, Will.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.810
I know,
but you said it yourself.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.480
It was an accident.

08:01.514 --> 08:02.614
Yeah.

08:15.528 --> 08:18.088
I forgot to ask
how the audition was yesterday.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.969
Cam?

08:24.003 --> 08:25.303
Um, sorry, what?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.038
What did you say?

08:27.073 --> 08:29.074
The audition?

08:29.108 --> 08:33.912
Um, it was productive,
and I had constructive feedback.

08:38.417 --> 08:40.751
You don't always have
to put that in.

08:40.785 --> 08:43.621
I think you're really handsome
without it.

08:43.655 --> 08:44.589
It builds character.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.891
Spare the flattery.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.659
It's a birth defect.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.428
Character doesn't book jobs;
perfection does.

08:55.301 --> 08:58.236
Make sure you keep the 30th free
for the masquerade.

08:58.271 --> 09:00.038
I thought your parents
were gonna be out of town.

09:00.072 --> 09:02.307
<i>They are, but they still
want to hold the party</i>

09:02.341 --> 09:06.177

which means you

09:06.212 --> 09:10.682
get to officially host
your first society event.

09:10.716 --> 09:14.553
- Really?
- Absolutely.

09:14.587 --> 09:18.290
Just make sure you wear
something respectable.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.604
Mmm.

09:21.427 --> 09:22.494
Do you love me?

09:24.764 --> 09:28.400
Do you really
have to question that?

09:28.434 --> 09:30.302
That really wasn't an answer.

09:30.336 --> 09:35.307
Oh, Cam, oh, hey, I chose you
out of all of the other girls.

09:35.341 --> 09:36.621
Of course I love you.

09:41.380 --> 09:43.214
Once I take over
the old man's business,

09:43.249 --> 09:48.153
we will be society's
most unstoppable "it" couple.

09:48.187 --> 09:51.056
Page Six won't be able to resist
running our wedding photos.

09:55.494 --> 09:58.430
You want to talk
about what happened last night,

09:58.464 --> 10:01.333
why Heidi was even there
to begin with?

10:01.367 --> 10:03.168
There's nothing
to talk about, Cam.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.253
<i>Hey, quieting down,
quieting down, everyone.</i>

10:22.288 --> 10:25.624
I know you're all preoccupied

10:25.658 --> 10:29.594
with the events at Price Hall
last night.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.364
Losing a fellow student
like that,

10:32.398 --> 10:35.934
<i>it can be
a traumatizing experience.</i>

10:35.968 --> 10:39.371
<i>Too often we're... we're
pressured to stay strong</i>

10:39.405 --> 10:41.439
<i>and keep our emotions buried,</i>

10:41.474 --> 10:44.142
and that's why I just
want to take a little time

10:44.176 --> 10:48.079
and talk about
how we're feeling.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.981
Anybody want to go first,
share their thoughts

10:50.016 --> 10:52.183
with the rest of us?

10:52.218 --> 10:54.919
I just think it's ridiculous
that the school's doing nothing.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.855
They should have at least
canceled classes today.

10:56.889 --> 10:58.523
That's good, Natalie,

10:58.557 --> 11:01.059
and it's normal
to feel angry and resentful.

11:01.093 --> 11:02.661
Really?
Cancel classes?

11:02.695 --> 11:04.529
Because some drunk girl
fell off a balcony?

11:04.563 --> 11:05.864
Fell?

11:05.898 --> 11:06.931
Suicide's
the second-leading cause

11:06.966 --> 11:08.133
of death for college students.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.934
Okay, let's not start rumors.

11:09.969 --> 11:13.271
According to the police
it was a tragic accident.

11:13.305 --> 11:16.107
I think it's disgusting
that the media is referring

11:16.142 --> 11:19.611
to this girl like she's just
some kind of statistic.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.980
Okay, go on.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.815
She was in my physics class,
okay?

11:23.849 --> 11:25.350
I sat next to her every day,

11:25.384 --> 11:27.652
and now she's gone.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.387
<i>What was her name?</i>

11:29.422 --> 11:30.955
Excuse me?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.791
Well, she sat next
to you every day,

11:32.825 --> 11:34.465
and you seem so distraught over
her death,

11:34.493 --> 11:36.561
so what was her name?

11:36.595 --> 11:39.030
<i>I didn't say
I actually talked to her.</i>

11:39.065 --> 11:40.498
You don't understand.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.568
Suicide or accident,
a person's dead.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.538
What exactly defines
an accident?

11:46.572 --> 11:48.106
I'm not quite sure
what you mean.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.908
Theoretically, let's just say

11:49.942 --> 11:51.276
that she was meeting someone
up there last night

11:51.310 --> 11:52.977
and wasn't alone,

11:53.012 --> 11:55.180
<i>someone who cornered her
against the railing.</i>

11:55.214 --> 11:56.881
<i>Would that be a crime?</i>

11:56.916 --> 12:00.185
Well, depending on
all the circumstances, sure.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.721
It could be
involuntary manslaughter.

12:02.755 --> 12:05.090
Murder, you mean.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.591
<i>Uh, well, yeah.</i>

12:06.625 --> 12:08.526
Anybody who happened
to be there could have

12:08.561 --> 12:11.062
legal action taken up
against them too, right?

12:11.097 --> 12:12.797
If they don't immediately
tell anyone.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.532
I'd assume giving drugs
to the victim beforehand

12:14.567 --> 12:15.767
couldn't help the situation
either, right?

12:15.801 --> 12:17.135
Lisa, do you know something

12:17.169 --> 12:19.738
about what happened there
last night?

46:39.062 --> 46:40.630
You know her?

46:40.664 --> 46:44.433
Uh, doesn't ring a bell.

46:44.468 --> 46:45.868
You sure?

46:45.903 --> 46:47.170
You've shared several
classes with her

46:47.204 --> 46:48.204
over the last few years.

46:48.238 --> 46:50.573
Uh, not to sound like a dick,

46:50.607 --> 46:52.575
but if someone
doesn't run in my circle,

46:52.609 --> 46:54.210
I've probably never
heard of them.

46:54.244 --> 46:57.246
She, uh, definitely
isn't in your circle,

46:57.281 --> 46:58.948
so I was surprised
that a witness spotted her

46:58.982 --> 47:01.083
with your friend,
Camille, Friday night.

47:01.118 --> 47:03.119
That's news to me.

47:03.153 --> 47:05.454
You're sure
you don't know her?

47:05.489 --> 47:07.089
It's a big island.

47:07.124 --> 47:08.891
She could have been
visiting anyone.

47:08.926 --> 47:10.459
It's a funny thing
that you don't recognize her,

47:10.494 --> 47:12.895
considering your relationship
with her roommate.

47:12.930 --> 47:15.431
Excuse me?

47:15.465 --> 47:19.302
Heidi Wilkes?
Shame what happened to her.

47:19.336 --> 47:21.504
I'm sure you're broken up
about her death.

47:21.538 --> 47:24.307
Yeah, no, of course I was.
Why do you ask?

47:24.341 --> 47:27.577
<i>You were seeing her,
weren't you?</i>

47:27.611 --> 47:28.911
Uh, I don't know
who told you that,

47:28.946 --> 47:31.113
but you have the wrong
information.

47:31.148 --> 47:32.882
Huh.
It's funny.

47:32.916 --> 47:34.717

considering the text history

47:34.751 --> 47:37.587
between the two of you
on her phone.

47:37.621 --> 47:39.589
She was supposed
to delete those.

47:39.623 --> 47:42.458
And according to a
conversation with her roommate,

47:42.492 --> 47:45.027
she was pregnant
on the night of her death.

47:45.062 --> 47:47.330
- Pregnant?
- Yeah.

47:47.364 --> 47:49.832

you didn't let that get around.
