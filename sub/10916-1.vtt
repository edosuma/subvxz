03:32.500 --> 03:35.400
This is unbelievable!
Look at this!

03:35.300 --> 03:38.300
There's no city like this in the world.
There never was!

03:38.200 --> 03:40.500
You act like you've never been here before.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.300
I don't get here often enough.
That's the problem.

03:43.200 --> 03:47.400
Can you picture how drop-dead
gorgeous this city is in the rain?

03:47.300 --> 03:50.600
Imagine this town in the '20s.
Paris in the '20s,

03:50.500 --> 03:52.800
in the rain; the artists and writers.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.900
Why does every city have to be in the rain?

03:54.800 --> 03:57.200
What's wonderful about getting wet?

03:57.100 --> 04:00.800
I mean, could you ever picture us
moving here after we're married?

04:00.600 --> 04:02.200
Oh God, no.

04:02.300 --> 04:04.500
I could never live out of the United States.

04:04.400 --> 04:07.100
You know, if I'd stayed here and written novels,

04:07.000 --> 04:12.500
and not gotten, you know, caught up in that,
just, grinding out movie scripts...

04:12.300 --> 04:13.100
I'll tell you something:

04:13.000 --> 04:15.400
I would drop the house in Beverly Hills,

04:15.300 --> 04:18.300
the pool, everything,
in a second.

04:18.300 --> 04:20.700
I mean, look:
This is where Monet lived and painted.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.600
We're 30 minutes from town.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.500
Imagine the two of us settling here.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.900
We could do it, I mean,
if my book turns out.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.300
You're in love with a fantasy.

04:30.300 --> 04:33.000
I'm in love with you.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.600
We should get back to town.
We're meeting Mom and Dad for dinner.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.800
Let's meet 'em.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.500
<i>There are our sightseers.</i>

04:48.400 --> 04:52.000
If I never see another charming
boulevard or bistro again, I...

04:51.900 --> 04:54.200
- What a town!
- Yes. To visit.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.700
I could see myself living here!

04:55.600 --> 04:57.700
I feel like the Parisians kind of "get me."

04:57.600 --> 05:00.800
I can see myself just strolling
along the Left Bank with a,

05:00.800 --> 05:02.600
you know, baguette under my arm,

05:02.500 --> 05:06.200
headed to CafÃ© de Flore
to scribble away on my book.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.900
What did Hemingway say?
He called it a "moveable feast."

05:08.700 --> 05:11.500
In this traffic, nothing moves.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.900
Well, a toast to John's new business venture here!

05:15.100 --> 05:16.500
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

05:16.900 --> 05:19.700
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.000
Well, I'll be perfectly frank.

05:21.900 --> 05:27.700
I'm excited about this corporate merger between
our folks and the French company, but otherwise,

05:27.500 --> 05:29.000
I'm not a big Francophile.

05:29.300 --> 05:33.100
- John hates their politics.
- Certainly been no friend to the United States.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.800
Well, I mean, you can't exactly blame them

05:34.700 --> 05:37.600
for not following us down that rabbit's hole in Iraq.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.700
- The whole Bush, you know,...
- Oh, please. Let's not get into this

05:39.600 --> 05:42.600
- bad discussion again and again.
- Honey, honey. We're not getting into-- By the way, it's

05:42.600 --> 05:44.600
fine for your father and I to disagree.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.700
That's what a democracy is.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.400
Your father defends the right-wing of the Republican party,

05:48.300 --> 05:50.500
and I happen to think you almost got to be

05:50.600 --> 05:53.700
- like, a demented lunatic, but it's like...
- Okay. Okay!

05:53.500 --> 05:57.300
But it doesn't mean we don't
respect each other's views, am I right?

06:00.200 --> 06:03.600
- Can we talk about the wedding plans?
- Yes! Please.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.500
Let's do that.

06:04.600 --> 06:08.100
- Your father is just...
- Inez?

06:07.900 --> 06:10.600
- Huh? Carol?
- Hi.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.900
Oh my G... What are you doing here?

06:14.300 --> 06:16.900
- Nice to see you! Hi.
- Hey!

06:16.700 --> 06:18.800
- How are you?
- Good, thanks.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.100
Paul and Carol Bates, this is my mother

06:21.000 --> 06:25.500
- and father, and, of course, you know Gail.
- Hi. Very nice to meet you.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.000
Well, you... you didn't mention
you were going to be here.

06:27.900 --> 06:29.100
No, it was sudden. Um...

06:29.000 --> 06:33.100
<i>Paul got invited to lecture at
the Sorbone.(sic.) Sorbonne.</i>

06:33.000 --> 06:35.600
Oh, how wonderful!

06:35.500 --> 06:38.700
Well, uh, Dad's here on business,
and we just decided to

06:38.600 --> 06:40.300
- freeload along. - Yes.
- Oh.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.300
That's great. We can spend some time together.

06:42.300 --> 06:45.900
Well, I think we have a
lot of commitments, but I'm sure it's...

06:45.800 --> 06:47.800
- What?
- Well, what are doing tomorrow?

06:47.700 --> 06:49.600
- We're driving to Verrsailles. (sic.)
- Versailles...

06:49.500 --> 06:50.500
- Versailles.
- Oh,

06:50.600 --> 06:52.500
- I'm dying to see Versailles.
- Yeah!

06:52.400 --> 06:55.100
But it's too...uh...
We're late...I think what we're...

06:55.100 --> 06:58.200
Tomorrow we're locked in
to a lunch at Brasserie Lipp.

06:58.100 --> 07:02.000
- Oh no, that's just...
- Yeah. Yeah, we are. That's already...

07:01.800 --> 07:05.500
You know I actually had
a professor that dined there,

07:05.400 --> 07:07.400
and saw James Joyce!

07:07.300 --> 07:09.400
Yeah, you know, like a
million years ago, and

07:09.300 --> 07:14.000
apparently, Joyce was eating
sauerkraut and frankfurters.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.000
Is that...
That's the end of the story?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Well, I mean it's not a story.
It's like a detailed...

07:18.900 --> 07:23.000
- We would LOVE to go to Versailles. Yes.
- Oh, good.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.600
I hope you're not going to be
as antisocial tomorrow at Versailles.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.900
- How was I antisocial?
- Oh, please!

07:28.000 --> 07:31.200
I mean, you could totally tell you didn't want to go.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.900
Well, I mean, they're your
friends, and I have to admit

07:33.800 --> 07:36.700
I'm not quite as taken with them as you are.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.900
He's brilliant.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.500
You know, I had such a crush on him
in college, and Carol's very bright.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.500
Well, he's a pseudo-intellectual.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.200
- Just a little bit.
- Uh, Gil,

07:45.200 --> 07:51.200
I hardly think he'd be lecturing at
the Sorbonne if he's a pseudo-intellectual.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.500
You should give him your book to read.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.000
Oh, come on. Why?

07:53.900 --> 07:56.000
No, because he could critique your writing,

07:55.900 --> 07:58.300
and maybe show you why you're
having so much trouble.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.000
I'm having trouble because
I'm a Hollywood hack

08:00.900 --> 08:04.000
who never gave actual
literature a real shot.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.200
- Until now.
- Please...Gil...

08:07.000 --> 08:10.400
Honey, just promise me something.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.000
If this book...doesn't pan out,

08:13.000 --> 08:15.200
that you'll stop
eating your brains out,

08:15.100 --> 08:18.100
and just go back to doing
what you do best.

08:18.100 --> 08:22.800
I mean, the studios adore you.
You're in demand...

08:22.700 --> 08:26.100
Do you really want to give
it all up just to struggle?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
- Well...
- Mmm?

08:30.400 --> 08:31.700
Mmm?

08:32.600 --> 08:35.400
Why would you...want to do that?

08:35.299 --> 08:37.500
I believe Louis moved his court here,

08:37.400 --> 08:39.799
uh, in 1682.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.799
Originally, all this was swampland.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.600
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,

08:43.600 --> 08:46.900
uh... in Old French, the word "versailles"

08:46.800 --> 08:49.000
means, uh, something like,

08:49.000 --> 08:52.300
- "terrain were the weeds have been pulled."
- Is that right?

08:52.200 --> 08:54.800
Uh... The... uh, middle section here

08:54.700 --> 08:58.600
uh... is... uh, French classical style at its height.

08:58.400 --> 09:01.600
Uh... The work, I believe, of...
uh, "Louis Vau" (Louis le Vau)

09:01.500 --> 09:03.300
- Yes.
- Uh...Mansart...I think...

09:03.200 --> 09:05.500
- Manzard. (sic.)
- ...and Charles le Brun, I believe.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.400
Yes, that's right.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.500
I could get used to a summer home like this.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.400
- I know you could.
- Me, too,

09:10.300 --> 09:12.400
except, remember: in those days,

09:12.400 --> 09:14.500
they only had baths,
and I'm definitely a shower man.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.200
Where are you two planning on
moving after you get married?

09:17.100 --> 09:19.400
Uh...Malibu.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.000
- Really?
- We're thinking about Malibu, yeah.

09:20.900 --> 09:24.200
I'm pushing for a little
attic in Paris with a skylight.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.600
- La bowhem? (sic.)
- Yeah,

09:25.500 --> 09:27.300
all that's missing is the tuberculosis.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.700
Exactly. Thank you.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.600
I mean, you know, the problem
is that he's not exactly sure

09:31.400 --> 09:33.400
- he can write a novel.
- Really?

09:33.400 --> 09:37.100
- Well...
- I mean, honey, so far your track record's-- you know, and...

09:37.000 --> 09:39.300
well, everyone loves your movies.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.800
- Yeah, well scripts are easier, so...
- Wow.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.400
Why don't you tell them about the lead
character that you're working on right now?

09:44.300 --> 09:46.100
- Yes!  - Oh, come on.
- I don't like to discuss my work.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.700
Well, dear, you don't have to tell
them the whole plot, just the character.

09:49.700 --> 09:51.600
- No, no, no.
- Okay.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.300
He works in a nostalgia shop.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.500
- What's a-- What's a nostalgia shop?
- Oh, not one of those stores where they sell

09:56.400 --> 09:59.100
Shirley Temple dolls and old radios?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.900
- And I never know who buys that stuff. Who'd want it?
- Exactly.

10:00.900 --> 10:04.200
- I don't know.
- Well, people who live in the past,

10:04.100 --> 10:06.900
people who think that
their lives would be happier

10:06.900 --> 10:09.100
if they lived in an earlier time.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.700
And just which era

10:10.700 --> 10:14.000
would you have preferred
to live in, Miniver Cheevy?

10:13.900 --> 10:16.900
Paris in the '20s, in the rain.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.700
- Wouldn't have been bad.
- And the rain was an acid rain.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.600
Oh, I see! And no global warming,

10:20.600 --> 10:22.600
no TV and suicide bombing,

10:22.600 --> 10:24.700
and nuclear weapons, drug cartels!

10:24.600 --> 10:27.300
Usual menu of clichÃ©d horror stories.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.300
You know, nostalgia is denial.

10:29.300 --> 10:32.600
- Denial of the painful present.
- Oh, whoa!

10:32.400 --> 10:35.200
Gil is a complete romantic.
I mean, he would be

10:35.200 --> 10:38.200
more than happy living in a
complete state of perpetual denial.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.300
- Really?
- And the name for this fallacy

10:40.200 --> 10:43.600
is called "golden-age thinking."

10:43.500 --> 10:46.200
- TouchÃ©.
- Yeah, the erroneous notion that

10:46.100 --> 10:49.500
a different time period is better
than the one one's living in.

10:49.300 --> 10:53.200
It's a flaw in the Romantic
imagination of those people who...

10:53.100 --> 10:57.300
who find it difficult to
cope with the depressive.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.400
<i>- Yes.
- This is the nicest ring we saw.</i>

11:00.300 --> 11:02.800
Diamonds for a wedding band.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.300
That's the way you'd have to go.
And then, everyone will see

11:05.100 --> 11:07.700
it in the back row when
he puts it on my finger.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.600
Oh, Inez. It's gonna be such an event!

11:12.500 --> 11:15.600
- I only wish that...
- I don't want to keep going over it.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.600
It's your choice. What can I say?

11:18.700 --> 11:23.200
Gil is-- he's smart,
and he's very successful.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.800
- He talks about giving that all up and moving here!
- Oh, yeah, he TALKS about it.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.200
Well, that frightens me.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.700
This is, of course, Rodin's most famous statue.

11:32.600 --> 11:36.000
A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.300
Rodin wished it to serve as his headstone and epitaph.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.600
- Is that true?
- It would be in Moudon. He died of the flu,

11:42.500 --> 11:46.800
if I'm not mistaken. In 1917, I believe.

11:46.600 --> 11:49.400
- Very good, sir.
- He's so knowledgeable, isn't he?

11:49.300 --> 11:54.600
Yeah. So much of Rodin's work was influenced by his wife, Camille.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.300
Yes, she was an influence, though
Camille was not the wife, but his mistress.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.400
- Camille? No.
- Yes.

12:00.300 --> 12:03.300
- Yes. Rose was the wife.
- No, he was never married to Rose.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.100
Yes, he did marry Rose,

12:05.000 --> 12:07.500
- in the last year their lives.
- I think you're mistaken.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.700
Are you arguing with the guide?

12:09.600 --> 12:13.800
- Yes, I am.
- Yeah. No, I'm certain, monsieur.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.900
Yeah, actually, she's right.

12:15.800 --> 12:19.400
I recently read a two-volume
biography on Rodin, and

12:19.400 --> 12:22.200
Rose was definitely the wife.
Camille, the mistress.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.800
- Yeah. You read that? Where did you...
- Yeah, I just read it.  I was surprised

12:24.700 --> 12:27.600
because I mistakenly thought, like you, that it was, yeah,

12:27.500 --> 12:29.000
the other way around.
It's an easy mistake.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.200
So, Dad invited you guys for a wine-tasting.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
- Oh, it'll be so French!
- Yeah, yeah.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.600
Paul is an expert on French wine.

12:36.500 --> 12:41.200
- You're joking. Really?
- Yes, of course.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.400
When did you read the biography on Rodin?

12:43.500 --> 12:47.600
Me? Why would I read
a biography on Rodin?

12:47.800 --> 12:51.800
I will always take a California wine, but,

12:51.800 --> 12:54.200
Napa Valley's 6,000 miles away.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.300
John, old boy, how are you, buddy?

12:56.200 --> 12:58.700
Oh, hey! What're you doing here?

12:59.500 --> 13:02.200
Come on. I can't stand that guy.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.300
Um...How 'bout

13:04.300 --> 13:07.000
- we try some more wine?
- Yes! Let's start here.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.500
Now, which would you prefer here?

13:08.400 --> 13:11.200
Well, I think we need to be scientific and just

13:11.100 --> 13:13.200
start drinking them all again. I don't know.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.700
- Why are your cheeks so red?
- What do you mean?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.300
- They're not red.
- They're bright red.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.500
Oh, maybe it's because of the
pheromones that you're giving off.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.400
These pheromones are driving me mad!

13:23.300 --> 13:26.400
- Stop it! Stop!
- Ahh-- Sex and alcohol.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.900
- Yeah.
- It fuels the desire

13:29.800 --> 13:31.800
but kills the performance,
according to the Bard.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.400
Have you tasted the '61?

13:34.300 --> 13:35.800
It is divine!

13:35.700 --> 13:37.500
- Though, Paul picked it out. I didn't...
- What?

13:37.900 --> 13:42.000
- What's happening? What's happening?
- Slightly more tannic than the '59,

13:41.900 --> 13:44.200
and I prefer a smoky feeling
to a fruity feeling.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.800
So, Carol-- Carol and I
are gonna go dancing.

13:49.900 --> 13:52.000
We heard of a great place. Interested?

13:52.600 --> 13:55.400
- No... I don't want to be a killjoy,
- Come on!

13:55.300 --> 13:57.400
but I need to get a little fresh air.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.900
Oh, come on! Come on!

13:59.300 --> 14:01.300
Although if you're just gonna sit there and obsess

14:01.200 --> 14:03.200
over where the fire exits are, then...

14:03.200 --> 14:06.200
Hey! If Gil doesn't want to go,
I'll share Paul with you.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.200
I am very democratic,

14:08.100 --> 14:11.100
and Paul is a marvelous dancer.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.100
If it's OK with you,
I think I just want to take a little walk,

14:14.000 --> 14:16.700
go to bed, and then we'll do it another night.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.500
OK. Alright, well I can go, though, right?

14:19.600 --> 14:21.800
- You want to go?
- Well, yeah,

14:22.200 --> 14:25.400
Yeah, I mean, I'm not tired,
and I've been dying to go dancing,

14:25.300 --> 14:27.300
and I'll just meet you back at the hotel.

14:27.300 --> 14:29.600
- I'll take good care of her.
- OK.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.200
I'll get a cab. Taxi!

14:31.200 --> 14:34.300
- OK, but you should take a cab.
- No, I'm not taking a cab.  I'm walking.

14:34.100 --> 14:37.200
- No, you'll get lost.
- OK, I'm gonna walk.

14:40.300 --> 14:43.500
Is he a good writer?
I mean, have you read his prose?

14:43.300 --> 14:46.300
- Well, he won't let anybody.
- He won't let?

14:46.500 --> 14:50.900
Oh look, I mean, if he wants, I'd be glad to
look over his novel and critique it for him.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.000
- That would be great!
- Would you?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.200
- You know, I think that's what he needs!
- Yeah?

14:55.100 --> 14:58.700
- Well, it helps.
- To have it read by someone. Yeah!

14:58.600 --> 15:00.200
- And you wouldn't pull any punches?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.900
- Well, I certainly won't be letting
you know I won't do that.
-No.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.100
I do that about you.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.800
See, but, the problem is,
when it comes to his writing,

15:07.700 --> 15:10.300
he has absolutely no respect
for anybody else's opinion.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.600
Really?

- Come on!

16:53.800 --> 16:56.600
Come on, guy!
Get in the car!

16:56.800 --> 16:59.400

Come on, have a drink. Come on!

17:12.099 --> 17:15.900

- OK.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.200

of musical lyrics - not that I can write melodies, and I try,

- Sure does.

20:32.500 --> 20:37.300

Liked? I loved!
All your work.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.500
Yes, it was a good book,
because it was an honest book,

23:21.500 --> 23:23.800
and that's what war does to men.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.900
And there's nothing fine and noble
about dying in the mud,

23:26.900 --> 23:29.000

25:04.200 --> 25:06.500
- A novel.
- 'Bout what?

25:06.400 --> 25:10.900
It's about a man who works
in a nostalgia shop.

25:10.700 --> 25:12.700
What the hell is a nostalgia shop?

25:12.700 --> 25:15.700
A place where they sell old things. Memorabilia.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.800
and... Does that sound terrible?

25:18.800 --> 25:22.400
No subject is terrible if the story is true.

25:22.300 --> 25:27.800
If the prose is clean and honest,
and if it affirms grace and courage under pressure.

25:28.700 --> 25:30.100
No good.

25:30.300 --> 25:34.200
Can I ask you the biggest favor in the world?

25:34.500 --> 25:37.200
- What is it?
- Would you read it?

25:37.300 --> 25:39.200
- Your novel?
- Yeah, it's like

25:39.100 --> 25:43.800
400 pages long, and I'm just
looking for, you know, an opinion.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.800
My opinion is I hate it.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.900
I mean, you haven't even read it.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.100
If it's bad, I'll hate it
because I hate bad writing,

25:50.000 --> 25:54.400
and if it's good, I'll be envious and hate it all the more.
You don't want the opinion of another writer.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.500
Yeah. You know, it's just...
You know what it is?

25:57.500 --> 25:59.600
I'm having a hard time,

25:59.500 --> 26:02.400
you know, trusting somebody to evaluate it.

26:02.300 --> 26:05.200
Writers are competitive.

26:05.300 --> 26:07.700
I'm not gonna be competitive with you.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.000
You're too self-effacing.
It's not manly.

26:09.900 --> 26:12.600
If you're a writer,
declare yourself the best writer!

26:12.500 --> 26:17.000
But you're not, as long as I'm around.
Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it?

26:16.800 --> 26:18.500
No, I don't.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.600
Hey, I'm not gonna read your novel,
but I'll tell you what I'll do.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.700
Yes?

26:21.700 --> 26:23.900
I'll bring it to Gertrude Stein's.

26:23.900 --> 26:26.300
She's the only one I trust with my writing.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.300
You'll show my novel to Gertrude Stein?

26:29.200 --> 26:32.100
- Give it to me.
- I'll bring it to you.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.700
- And she gets back from Spain tomorrow.
- Great.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.800
I'm gonna go get it.
I'm gonna...

26:35.800 --> 26:39.100
I can't tell you how excited I am!
This is gonna be such a lift!

26:38.900 --> 26:41.000
My heart is just racing right now!

26:40.900 --> 26:43.900
I'm gonna get it, and I'll be back.

26:53.500 --> 26:58.000
Whoa, whoa, Gil!
Take it easy!

26:57.800 --> 27:02.300
You had a big night.
Fitzgerald. Hemingway!

27:02.100 --> 27:04.600
Papa!
You gotta...

27:05.800 --> 27:08.300
OK, we never said where
we were gonna meet.

27:45.300 --> 27:49.600
Good thing you didn't go last night.
You would've hated the music, and the crowd,

27:49.400 --> 27:51.400
but I had fun.

27:52.700 --> 27:55.400
What're you thinking about?
You seem like you're in a daze.

27:56.900 --> 27:59.700
If I was to tell you that I spent

28:00.300 --> 28:03.200
last night with Ernest Hemingway
and Scott Fitzgerald,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.500
- what would you say?
- Is that what you were dreaming about?

28:05.400 --> 28:07.400
Your literary idols?

28:07.400 --> 28:09.700
Yeah, but if I wasn't dreaming...

28:10.900 --> 28:12.500
What does that mean?

28:12.600 --> 28:15.700
If I was with Hemingway,
and Fitzgerald,

28:15.600 --> 28:17.100
and Cole Porter.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.000
I'd be thinking brain tumor.

28:19.200 --> 28:22.300
And when I tell you,
Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly

28:22.100 --> 28:26.800
as we've come to know her through
everything we've read in books and articles.

28:26.600 --> 28:29.700
You know, charming, but all over the map.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.500
You know, she does not like
Hemingway one bit.

28:32.400 --> 28:37.800
and Scott knows Hemingway is right about her,
but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her!

28:38.000 --> 28:39.700
Come on! Get up! We should

28:39.700 --> 28:42.600
quit the idle chatter,
because we're gonna be late.

28:43.100 --> 28:44.700
You know, I'm not gonna...

28:44.700 --> 28:47.400
I think I'm gonna stay here
and do some work on my novel,

28:47.300 --> 28:49.300
'cause there's a little polishing I wanna do.

28:49.200 --> 28:54.800
No. You can do that later.
Mom said we can use her decorator's discount. Get up!

28:55.800 --> 28:58.200
Come look at these, Inez.

28:58.100 --> 29:01.500
Wouldn't these be charming in a Malibu beach house?

29:01.500 --> 29:04.600
<i>- Combien, monsieur? (How much, sir?)
- Dix-huit mille. (â¬18,000)</i>

29:04.500 --> 29:06.300
<i>- Merci. (Thanks.)
- What is that?</i>

29:06.200 --> 29:08.700
There a steal at $18,000.

29:08.600 --> 29:11.100
$18,000 for this?

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
Oh wait. It's Euros, so it's more.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.900
- So that's like 20. $20,000.
- Even more, I think. Yeah.

29:16.700 --> 29:20.100
I know, but it's very hard
to find anything like this at home.

29:20.000 --> 29:24.100
- She's right, Gil.
- I know, but we haven't even found a house yet,

29:23.900 --> 29:28.800
and we're trying to keep expenses down,
so I don't have to take any crummy rewrite jobs.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.900
Well, you get what you pay for.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.300
- Nice.
- Cheap is cheap.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.800
OK, you guys want to walk back?

29:36.700 --> 29:39.300
Walk? No, it's starting to rain.

29:39.300 --> 29:42.200
Oh, it'll be nice walking in the rain!
It's beautiful!

29:42.100 --> 29:45.400
No, there's nothing beautiful
about walking in the rain.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.900
No, don't forget.
We're taking you to dinner tonight.

29:47.800 --> 29:49.300
Oh, right. Yes. Great.

29:49.200 --> 29:53.300
And then, also, I have a big
surprise for you after dinner.

29:53.100 --> 29:57.700
- What? No. I don't like surprises.
- I have an incredible...Trust me, you're gonna love this.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.400
- What is it?
- Are you sure you don't want to walk in the rain?

29:59.300 --> 30:03.700
This is our last chance.
It's not that bad out.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.500
Okay.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.000
I don't understand.
Where are we going?

30:10.900 --> 30:12.900
But, you made us rush through dinner,

30:12.800 --> 30:15.300
and Dad wasn't finished with his profiteroles.

30:15.200 --> 30:19.800
Profiteroles? You're going to have
the most amazing adventure of your life!

30:19.600 --> 30:23.300
- Where?
- Just, Inez, please.

30:23.500 --> 30:27.800
- Why are you carrying that manuscript around?
- You'll see, and when you do,

30:27.600 --> 30:29.600
your jaw is gonna drop.

30:29.500 --> 30:34.900
OK. You know I wouldn't hide anything,
so if I'm saying it's incredible,

30:34.700 --> 30:38.500
- it's...
- OK.

30:41.700 --> 30:46.300
- It's just, I don't understand!
- I know. You've been wondering why I've been acting strange all day?

30:46.100 --> 30:48.400
- Yeah.
- Well, you're about to find out,

30:48.300 --> 30:53.200
and you're gonna wonder why I wasn't
acting more strange, when you find out.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.500
- This is very...
- I know. I know.

31:04.700 --> 31:08.500
Well, I don't know what you're carrying on about,
but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure.

31:08.300 --> 31:11.800
I am tired from the gym and a massage,
so I'm gonna get this cab.

31:11.700 --> 31:14.200
- Taxi!
- Inez, wait!

31:14.100 --> 31:16.200
- Let's just wait a little longer.
- Look,

31:16.400 --> 31:19.600
you want to walk the streets of Paris,
and take it in by night,

31:19.500 --> 31:23.300
that's fine. You go ahead.
But I'm in the middle of a great book that Carol lent me.

31:23.100 --> 31:26.000
Come on, just 10 more minutes,
and then we can walk home.

31:25.900 --> 31:29.200
If I'm asleep when you get in,
don't wake me up.

31:34.200 --> 31:37.000
What am I doing wrong?

31:36.900 --> 31:40.300
Unless she's right,
and I need to see a neurologist.

31:40.500 --> 31:45.600
OK, you left the wine-tasting, a little drunk,
but not out of control.

31:45.400 --> 31:49.200
Lost, you walk along...
this is the spot...

31:49.000 --> 31:51.600
I mean, it's just like a one-shot deal.

31:53.300 --> 31:56.100
The clock struck midnight...

32:09.300 --> 32:10.800
Hello!

32:13.600 --> 32:16.400
Oh, hi, Mr. Hemingway. Here.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.200
Let me just jump in.

32:26.700 --> 32:29.700
The assignment was to take the hill.
There were 4 of us.

32:29.600 --> 32:33.100
5 if you counted Vicente, but he had
lost his hand when a grenade went off

32:32.900 --> 32:35.400
and couldn't fight as he could when I first met him.

32:35.300 --> 32:37.300
And he was young, and brave.

32:37.200 --> 32:41.300
And the hill was soggy from days of rain,
and the hill sloped down toward a road,

32:41.200 --> 32:43.700
and there were many German soldiers on the road.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.700
And the idea was to aim for the first group,

32:45.600 --> 32:48.800
and if our aim was true, we could delay them.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.500
- Were you scared?
- Of what?

32:52.500 --> 32:54.200
Getting killed?

32:54.900 --> 32:57.600
You'll never write well
if you're afraid of dying.

32:57.600 --> 33:00.200
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do. I'd say it's probably...

33:00.100 --> 33:02.300
maybe my greatest fear, actually.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.800
Well, that's something all men before
you have done. All men will do.

33:05.600 --> 33:09.600
- I know. I know.
- Have you ever made love to a truly great woman?

33:09.700 --> 33:12.900
Actually, my fiancÃ©e is pretty sexy.

33:12.700 --> 33:15.700
And when you make love to her,
you feel true, and beautiful

33:15.600 --> 33:19.800
passion, and you, for at least that moment,
lose your fear of death.

33:19.600 --> 33:21.900
No. That doesn't happen.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.800
I believe that love that is true and real
creates a respite from death.

33:25.700 --> 33:30.200
All cowardice comes from not loving,
or not loving well, which is the same thing.

33:30.000 --> 33:34.000
And when the man who is brave and true
looks Death squarely in the face

33:33.800 --> 33:38.200
like some rhino-hunters I know,
or Belmonte, who's truly brave.

33:38.100 --> 33:43.200
It is because they love with sufficient
passion, to push death out of their minds,

33:42.900 --> 33:45.800
until it returns, as it does, to all men.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.900
And then you must make really good love again.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.000
Think about it.

34:06.300 --> 34:07.600
- Alice. How the hell are you?
- Hi!

34:07.600 --> 34:10.800
Good? Good. Ah, she's here. Follow me.

34:10.900 --> 34:13.300
<i>- Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.(No. I don't agree.)
- Mais pourquoi? (But why?)</i>

34:13.199 --> 34:14.500
<i>Parce-que... (Because...)</i>

34:14.400 --> 34:16.900
This is Gil Pender, Miss Stein.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.400
He's a young American writer.
I thought you two should know each other.

34:19.300 --> 34:20.800
I'm glad you're here.

34:20.699 --> 34:23.699
You can help decide which of us is right,
and which of us is wrong.

34:23.600 --> 34:27.000
I was just telling Pablo that
this portrait doesn't capture Adriana.

34:26.900 --> 34:30.199
It has a universality, but no objectivity.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.199
<i>Non, non, non. Vous ne le comprenez pas correctement.
(No, no ,no. You don't understand correctly.)</i>

34:32.100 --> 34:33.900
<i>Connaisez pas Adriana. Regardez...
(You don't know Adriana. Look...)</i>

34:33.900 --> 34:35.400
<i>Regardez le mouvement, le tableau.
(Look at the motion, the painting.)</i>

34:35.300 --> 34:37.000
<i>C'est exactement ce qu'elle reprÃ©sente!
(It's exactly what she represents!)</i>

34:37.000 --> 34:40.000
<i>Non. Tu n'as pas raison.(No. You're wrong.)
Look how he's done her:</i>

34:39.900 --> 34:42.300
dripping with sexual innuendo,

34:42.199 --> 34:46.199
carnal to the point of smoldering,
and, yes, she's beautiful, but

34:46.100 --> 34:49.100
it's a subtle beauty;
an implied sensuality.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.600
I mean, what is your first
impression of Adriana?

34:55.199 --> 34:57.000
Exceptionally lovely.

34:56.900 --> 35:00.200
<i>Belle, mais trop subtile. Plus implicite, Pablo!
(Beautiful, but too subtle. More defined, Pablo!)</i>

35:00.100 --> 35:02.500
Yes, you're right, Miss Stein.
'Course...uh...

35:02.400 --> 35:04.700
you can see why he's lost all objectivity.

35:04.600 --> 35:06.600
He's made a creature of Place Pigalle.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.300
A whore with volcanic appetites.

35:08.200 --> 35:10.700
<i>Non, non! C'est ce qu'elle vraiment si vous la connaissez!
(No, no! It's true if you know her!)</i>

35:10.600 --> 35:12.800
<i>Yes, avec toi, au privÃ©,
(Yes, with you, in private,)</i>

35:12.700 --> 35:15.600
because she's your lover,
but we don't know her that way!

35:15.500 --> 35:19.400
So you make a petit-bourgeois judgment
and turn her into an object of pleasure.

35:19.200 --> 35:23.200
<i>- It's more like a still-life than a portrait.
- Non.</i>

35:23.100 --> 35:26.800
<i>Non. Non. Je ne suis pas d'accord.
(No. No. I do not agree.)</i>

35:26.800 --> 35:28.800
And what's this book of
yours I've been hearing about?

35:28.700 --> 35:29.700
Is this it?

35:29.700 --> 35:31.600
- Yeah, this is...uh...
- I'll take a look.

35:31.500 --> 35:33.300
Have you read it, Hemingway?

35:33.200 --> 35:36.900
No, this I leave to you.
You've always been a fine judge of my work.

35:37.000 --> 35:39.600
" "Out of the Past" was the name of the store,"

35:39.500 --> 35:41.900
"and its products consisted of memories."

35:41.800 --> 35:45.100
"What was prosaic and
even vulgar to one generation,"

35:44.900 --> 35:48.000
"had been transmuted by
the mere passing of years"

35:47.900 --> 35:52.200
"to a status at once magical and also camp."

35:52.100 --> 35:54.100
I love it.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.600
I'm already hooked.
Hooked!

35:58.400 --> 36:00.000
I'll start it tonight,

35:59.900 --> 36:02.800
but first, you and I
have something to talk about.

36:02.700 --> 36:06.300
<i>I've been waiting for two months
for a reply from that editor.</i>

36:06.100 --> 36:09.200
<i>I sent him the piece you and I
looked at, plus four others,</i>

36:09.100 --> 36:12.800
<i>plus four shorter pieces.
And this guy, I gave him a copy of the...</i>

36:15.100 --> 36:19.600
<i>- Nevertheless, two months: nary a word.
- Right.</i>

36:21.900 --> 36:25.300
So were you really hooked
with those opening lines?

36:26.300 --> 36:31.200
Oh, the past has always had a
great charisma for me.

36:31.000 --> 36:35.300
Oh, me, too.
Great charisma for me.

36:35.100 --> 36:38.000
I always say that I was born too late.

36:37.900 --> 36:40.600
<i>Mmm. Moi aussi.
(Mmm. Me, too.)</i>

36:40.900 --> 36:43.900
<i>For me, la Belle Ãpoque Paris
would have been perfect.</i>

36:43.800 --> 36:46.800
- Really? Better than now?
- Yes.

36:46.700 --> 36:51.300
Another whole sensibility,
the street lamps, the kiosques,

36:51.100 --> 36:55.400
the...horse and carriages,

36:55.300 --> 36:58.000
and Maxim's then.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.500
You speak very good English.

37:00.700 --> 37:04.000
- No, not really.
- No, you do!

37:04.000 --> 37:06.400
How long have you been dating Picasso?

37:06.300 --> 37:09.300
My God, did I just say that?

37:09.200 --> 37:10.600
Pardon?

37:10.600 --> 37:16.700
I don't mean to...I didn't mean to pry....
Were you born in Paris?

37:16.900 --> 37:19.900
I was born in Bordeaux.

37:20.100 --> 37:22.900
I moved here to study fashion.

37:22.800 --> 37:24.700
But you don't want to hear all this.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.600
Yes, I do.

37:26.500 --> 37:31.100
Yes, continue.
You moved here to study fashion...

37:31.100 --> 37:35.300
I...came here to study with Coco Chanel,

37:35.100 --> 37:37.800
<i>and I fell in love with Paris,</i>

37:37.800 --> 37:39.800
and also,

37:39.800 --> 37:45.400
a very dark-eyed, haunted
Jewish-Italian painter.

37:46.300 --> 37:53.800
And I knew Amedeo had another woman, but still,
I couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked,

37:53.500 --> 37:56.300
and it was a beautiful six months.

37:56.200 --> 37:59.300
M..M...Modigliani?

37:59.200 --> 38:03.700
You lived with...
You lived with Modigliani?

38:03.500 --> 38:08.500
You asked me,
so I'm telling you my sad story.

38:09.800 --> 38:13.300
With Braque, though, there was another woman.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.500
Many.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.200
And now,

38:18.100 --> 38:20.100
with Pablo.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.800
I mean, he's married,
but...

38:23.800 --> 38:27.300
every day, it's on-again, off-again.

38:27.100 --> 38:32.300
I don't know how any woman
can stay with him. He's so difficult.

38:33.300 --> 38:37.600
My God, you take "art groupie"
to a whole new level!

38:37.400 --> 38:41.700
- Pardon?
- Nothing. I was just saying that...

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
But tell me about yourself.

38:43.400 --> 38:48.400
- What? Well, what can I say...
- So, have you come to Paris to write?

38:48.500 --> 38:50.700
Because, you know,

38:50.600 --> 38:55.600
these days, so many Americans
feel the need to move here.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.900
Isn't Hemingway attractive?

38:59.900 --> 39:02.800
I love his writing.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.400
I know. Actually, I'm just here visiting.

39:06.300 --> 39:08.300
Oh, you must stay here.

39:08.200 --> 39:12.500
- Really?
- Yeah. It's a wonderful city, for

39:12.300 --> 39:17.800
- writers, artists.
- I know. I'd like to, but it's not that easy.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.600
And,

39:20.500 --> 39:24.500
I didn't fall in love madly with your book...

39:24.300 --> 39:27.000
- Really?
- ...so I want to hear the rest of it.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.600
- You really like? Because I'm still kind of tinkering...
- Pender?

39:31.400 --> 39:35.800
- Yeah, let's go up to Montmartre. Let's get a drink, OK?
- Uh...yeah.

39:35.600 --> 39:40.100
I'll discuss your book with you as soon as I've finished it.
Where can I reach you?

39:39.900 --> 39:44.200
Why don't I drop back by, instead of you
trying to find me, if that's all right?

39:44.000 --> 39:48.400
- We run an open house.
- Are you coming with us?

39:48.300 --> 39:51.900
I wish that I could.
I cant, but

39:51.700 --> 39:54.700
hopefully I'll see you again eventually.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.800
That would be nice.

39:56.900 --> 40:00.000
- Let's go!
- One of these days, I plan to steal you away from this genius

39:59.900 --> 40:02.500
who's great, but he's no MirÃ³.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.800
I'm Gil Pender.

40:20.700 --> 40:25.000
I was with Hemingway, and Picasso.

40:24.800 --> 40:29.100
Pablo Picasso, and Ernest Hemingway.

40:29.700 --> 40:33.300
I'm Gil Pender, from Pasadena!

40:33.600 --> 40:37.700
Cub Scouts. I failed freshman English.

40:37.900 --> 40:41.300
Little old Gil Pender has his novel

40:41.200 --> 40:44.900
with Gertrude. Stein.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.200
Boy, that girl was so...

40:48.500 --> 40:50.800
lovely.

40:53.700 --> 40:56.900
Well, it's a shame you two didn't
come to the movies with us last night,

40:56.700 --> 40:59.600
We saw a wonderfully
funny American film.

40:59.500 --> 41:01.200
Who was in it?

41:01.200 --> 41:03.100
Oh, I don't know.
I forget the name.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.700
Wonderful but forgettable.
That sounds like a picture I've seen.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.100
I probably wrote it.

41:08.100 --> 41:11.000
Well, I know it was moronic and infantile, and

41:10.800 --> 41:13.600
utterly lacking in any wit or believability,

41:13.500 --> 41:16.900
- but John and I laughed in spite of all that.
- Have we been down this way yet?

41:16.800 --> 41:18.800
Was it?

41:19.900 --> 41:21.700
What time did you get in last night?

41:21.600 --> 41:24.400
Not that late...uh...
I was...uh...

41:24.300 --> 41:27.800
I'm really finding these midnight strolls
great for me creatively,

41:27.600 --> 41:30.800
without the distractions of the day.
I'll probably end up going on another little

41:30.700 --> 41:33.900
- hike tonight.
- Well, we'll see.

41:33.900 --> 41:36.300
Yeah. We'll see.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.900
Oh, look at those wonderful glass figures.

41:39.700 --> 41:44.700
<i>[Cole Porter's "You Do Something to Me"]
âª ...that simply mystifies me âª</i>

41:44.700 --> 41:50.600
<i>âª Tell me why should it be  âª</i>

41:50.700 --> 41:56.800
<i>âª You have the power to hypnotize me âª</i>

41:56.700 --> 41:58.400
<i>Vous aimez?
(You like?)</i>

41:58.400 --> 42:00.500
Yes. Very beautiful.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.500
- Oh. You're American.
- Yeah.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.500
You like Cole Porter?

42:04.500 --> 42:07.600
I do. I'm a big fan.
I like to

42:07.400 --> 42:11.500
kind of think I'm a member
of Linda and Cole's inner circle.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.400
I'm kidding.

42:14.100 --> 42:15.800
Very pretty lyrics.

42:15.800 --> 42:18.800
- Very amusing.
- Charming.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.200
Gil?

42:25.100 --> 42:27.600
- Gil? Hi.
- Yeah? Yes.

42:27.500 --> 42:29.900
- Yeah. We should go.
- We're going now?

42:29.800 --> 42:33.300
Yeah. We're meeting Paul and Carol
at the museum for the private showing.

42:33.100 --> 42:34.600
- OK. Yeah. Right.

42:34.700 --> 42:37.200
You know, Paul happens to be an expert in Monet,

42:37.100 --> 42:39.100
so you'll find it enlightening, I think.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.200
Yeah. OK.

42:40.100 --> 42:43.000
Let's get some culture.

42:43.900 --> 42:46.600
The juxtaposition of color is amazing.

42:46.500 --> 42:49.100
This man was the real father

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
of abstract expressionism.

42:50.900 --> 42:53.100
I take that back.
Maybe Turner.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.900
I mean, I love Turner,

42:55.900 --> 42:57.900
but, I just find this...

42:57.800 --> 42:59.000
overwhelming.

42:58.900 --> 43:02.200
If I'm not mistaken,
it took him 2 years to complete this.

43:02.100 --> 43:05.300
He worked out of Giverny,
where he was frequently...

43:05.200 --> 43:08.400
I heard that Monet,
one of the things that he used to try to...

43:08.300 --> 43:10.900
Shh! I'm trying to hear Paul say it.

43:10.900 --> 43:13.100
Well, he was frequently
visited by Caillebotte,

43:13.000 --> 43:16.100
an artist who I personally feel was underrated.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.300
Ah. Now.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.500
Here's a superb Picasso.

43:20.400 --> 43:24.600
If I'm not mistaken, he painted
this marvelous portrait of his

43:24.400 --> 43:28.100
French mistress
Madeleine Brissou in the '20s.

43:28.400 --> 43:31.400
Paul, I'm gonna have to
differ with you on this one.

43:31.300 --> 43:33.600
- Really.
- Gil, just pay attention.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.100
You might learn something.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.100
OK, well, if I'm not mistaken,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.600
this was a failed attempt to capture

43:39.500 --> 43:42.300
a young French girl named Adriana,

43:42.200 --> 43:45.300
from Bordeaux, if my art history serves me,

43:45.200 --> 43:49.300
who came to Paris to study
costume design for the theater.

43:49.100 --> 43:53.000
I'm pretty sure she had an affair
with Modigliani, then Braque,

43:52.800 --> 43:55.500
which is how Pablo met her.
Picasso.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.500
Of course, what you don't get

43:57.400 --> 44:00.200
from this portrait
is the subtlety,

44:00.100 --> 44:02.600
and her beauty.
She was just a knock-out.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.400
What have you been smoking?

44:06.500 --> 44:09.100
I'd hardly call this picture marvelous,

44:09.000 --> 44:11.300
it's more of a petit-bourgeois statement

44:11.200 --> 44:14.200
on how Pablo sees her. Saw her.

44:14.300 --> 44:16.700
He's distracted by the fact
that she was a

44:16.600 --> 44:19.500
absolute volcano in the sack.

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Too rich for me.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.900
Where'd Gil run off to?

44:32.100 --> 44:33.500
Work.

44:34.700 --> 44:36.800
Been walking around Paris. You know,

44:36.800 --> 44:41.900
the way the city's lit up at night
allegedly inspires him, so...

44:41.700 --> 44:45.200
But that's OK,
because I'm going dancing with Paul.

44:45.200 --> 44:46.900
Where's Carol?

44:46.800 --> 44:49.900
uh...She's in bed with a bad oyster,

44:49.800 --> 44:51.200
so I'll see you guys later.

44:51.100 --> 44:53.100
Thanks for dinner, Daddy.

44:53.300 --> 44:55.300
Bye, sweetie.

44:57.100 --> 44:58.900
Where do you think
Gil goes every night?

44:58.800 --> 45:02.800
You heard her.
He walks, and gets ideas.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.800
- You sound skeptical.
- No.

45:04.700 --> 45:08.400
I've seen what he earns,
but sometimes I think he's got a...

45:08.200 --> 45:09.600
got a... part missing,

45:09.600 --> 45:11.600
and I didn't like his remark about

45:11.500 --> 45:13.800
Tea Party Republicans.
They are decent

45:13.700 --> 45:15.600
people trying to take back the country.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.500
They are not
crypto-fascist

45:17.400 --> 45:19.400
airhead zombies.
You hear him say that?

45:19.300 --> 45:21.900
Nevertheless, I don't think
your idea of having him followed

45:21.800 --> 45:24.100
- is very practical.
- No?

45:24.100 --> 45:25.900
I'd like to know where he goes every night.

45:25.900 --> 45:27.600
Well, we know one thing:

45:27.500 --> 45:29.300
he doesn't go dancing.

45:41.500 --> 45:43.700
Oh! Excuse me!

45:44.800 --> 45:47.600
- Is this gentleman bothering you?
- Hello, Gil!

45:47.400 --> 45:50.000
Hey! How are you?
I was hoping we'd see you here.

45:50.300 --> 45:52.500
- What a great party!
- Oh, good.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.400
- It's nice to see you here.
- Thank you.

45:54.400 --> 45:56.400
Oh, Delfine?

45:56.300 --> 45:58.900
- Gil, we'll catch up with you later, OK?
- Sure, sure.

45:58.800 --> 46:00.800
<i>Bon soir, Madame.
(Good evening, Madame.)</i>

46:00.700 --> 46:03.300
- What a surprise!
- It was just a total fluke.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.000
I was at Gertrude Stein's,

46:04.900 --> 46:07.100
she's almost finished with my novel,
and I run into this guy.

46:07.000 --> 46:09.400
Turns out he's Archibald MacLeish.
He says he's on his way over here,

46:09.300 --> 46:11.100
come on over. Oh, I'm not
going to crash the Fitzgeralds,

46:11.000 --> 46:13.800
but then he said you'd be here.
You and Pablo, and...

46:13.700 --> 46:15.300
Oh, Pablo's home.

46:15.300 --> 46:18.700
- We had a...bit of a quarrel.
- Oh no!

46:18.800 --> 46:22.400
- You look like you were having fun with Djuna Barnes, dancing.
- Oh, yeah!

46:22.300 --> 46:24.300
Wait. That was Djuna Barnes?

46:24.200 --> 46:26.700
- Yeah.
- Wow. No wonder she wanted to lead.

46:26.600 --> 46:30.500
Isn't this a wonderful
place to throw a party?

46:30.300 --> 46:33.700
- It's so great!
- Only the Fitzgeralds can do that!

46:33.700 --> 46:36.800
- I want to show you something. Come with me.
- OK.

46:38.400 --> 46:41.900
- So, what about your book?
- It's coming along. Yeah!

46:42.400 --> 46:44.600
Look at that!

46:44.500 --> 46:48.100
- Wow!
- It's from the turn of the century.

46:48.000 --> 46:51.300
Isn't it beautiful?
It's my favorite era.

46:51.200 --> 46:54.200
I love it so much.
Everything was so perfect.

46:54.100 --> 46:56.100
It's so nice to see you tonight.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.800
- I was hoping to...
- It's so nice to see you!

46:57.700 --> 47:00.000
<i>VoilÃ , ma petite Adriana!
(There she is, my little Adriana!)</i>

47:00.000 --> 47:04.800
Isn't this little Parisian
dream a moveable feast?

47:04.700 --> 47:06.900
Mark my words.
I'm going to steal you away

47:06.800 --> 47:09.800
from that fugitive from
MÃ¡laga one way or another.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.400
Between Belmonte and myself,
whom would you choose?

47:12.300 --> 47:13.900
<i>Vous Ãªtes tous deux parfaits.
(You are both perfect.)</i>

47:13.900 --> 47:16.800
But he has more courage.
He faces death more often, and

47:16.600 --> 47:19.800
more directly, and if you chose him,
I'd be disappointed, but I'd understand.

47:19.700 --> 47:21.300
<i>Ella ha elegido Pablo.>
(She chose Pablo.)</i>

47:21.200 --> 47:23.800
Yes, she's chosen Picasso,
but Pablo thinks

47:23.700 --> 47:26.400
women are only to sleep
with or to paint.

47:26.500 --> 47:27.800
What about you?

47:27.800 --> 47:30.500
I think a woman is equal
to a man in courage.

47:30.400 --> 47:33.000
Have you ever shot
a charging lion?

47:33.100 --> 47:34.600
Never.

47:34.600 --> 47:36.900
Would you like to know
how that feels?

47:36.800 --> 47:38.800
- I don't think so.
- You ever hunted?

47:38.700 --> 47:40.100
- No.
- You?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.300
Only for bargains.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.700
<i>TomÃ©monos otra copita.
(Let's take another drink.)</i>

47:45.700 --> 47:48.700
You know, it's so loud,
I wonder if we can go some place

47:48.600 --> 47:52.700
- where we can hear ourselves think a little bit?
- Sure! Bye.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.700
Who wants a fight?

47:54.600 --> 47:58.000
Well, I hope it was nothing
serious with you and Pablo.

47:57.900 --> 48:00.500
He's moody and possessive.

48:00.400 --> 48:02.300
Artists are like children.

48:02.200 --> 48:05.400
Well, you certainly understand why
all these guys want to paint you,

48:05.300 --> 48:08.400
'cause you have just about
one of the best faces ever.

48:08.200 --> 48:11.300
- It's so interesting...
- Oh?

48:11.500 --> 48:15.600
- You're interesting, too, in a lost way.
- Lost?

48:16.200 --> 48:18.200
Well, I guess I am lost.

48:18.100 --> 48:20.100
Tell me more about your book.

48:20.100 --> 48:23.200
My book is kind of a...

48:23.300 --> 48:27.700
You know what?
I couldn't care less about my book tonight.

48:27.500 --> 48:29.700
I just want to walk around Paris with you.

48:29.600 --> 48:32.600
I keep forgetting you're just a tourist.

48:32.500 --> 48:34.600
That's putting it mildly.

48:34.500 --> 48:36.700
I can never decide whether

48:36.600 --> 48:40.300
Paris is more beautiful by day or by night.

48:40.200 --> 48:42.300
No, you can't.
You couldn't pick one. I mean,

48:42.300 --> 48:46.000
I can give you a checkmate
argument for each side.

48:45.800 --> 48:49.000
You know, I sometimes think,
"How's anyone gonna come up with a

48:48.900 --> 48:50.900
book, or a painting, or a

48:50.800 --> 48:54.300
symphony or a sculpture that can
compete with a great city?"

48:54.200 --> 48:56.700
You can't, 'cause, like,
you look around, every...

48:56.600 --> 49:00.500
every street, every boulevard
is its own special art form.

49:00.700 --> 49:03.600
And when you think that in the cold,

49:03.500 --> 49:07.900
violent, meaningless universe,
that Paris exists, these lights...

49:07.700 --> 49:11.700
I mean, come on, there's nothing
happening on Jupiter or Neptune,

49:11.500 --> 49:14.600
but from way out in space
you can see these lights,

49:14.500 --> 49:18.600
the cafÃ©s, people drinking, and singing...

49:18.400 --> 49:23.000
I mean, for all we know,
Paris is the hottest spot in the universe.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.100
<i>- Vous Ãªtes un poÃ¨te.(You are a poet.)
- Aw, come on.</i>

49:25.000 --> 49:30.400
It's just... You're very kind,
but I wouldn't call my babbling poetic.

49:30.200 --> 49:32.900
Although I was on a pretty good roll there.

49:33.200 --> 49:34.900
See anything you like?

49:34.800 --> 49:38.400
Yeah. I'm ashamed to admit
I'm attracted to all of them.

49:38.300 --> 49:41.600
I like cheap sexy.
That makes me shallow.

49:41.900 --> 49:45.400
When I was in Catholic school,
one weekend

49:45.200 --> 49:48.700
my roommate and I,
we paid a girl from Pigalle

49:48.600 --> 49:52.000
to come and teach us all her tricks.

49:51.900 --> 49:54.000
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

49:53.900 --> 49:55.900
Wow. That's...

49:56.300 --> 50:02.200
That's...That's...
I'm going to be thinking about that one.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.100
I love walking with you.

50:11.200 --> 50:14.300
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

50:17.100 --> 50:19.900
God, is that who I think it is?

50:19.900 --> 50:22.400
What is she doing here,
staring into the water?

50:22.300 --> 50:24.700
Oh my God!

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Zelda, what are you doing?!

50:26.900 --> 50:29.500
- Please? I don't want to live!
- Stop!

50:29.400 --> 50:32.400
- What is it?
- Scott and that beautiful countess.

50:32.900 --> 50:35.100
They were-- It was so obvious
they were whispering about me,

50:35.000 --> 50:38.500
and the more they drank,
the more he fell in love with her!

50:38.300 --> 50:40.100
He...Scott loves only you.

50:40.100 --> 50:42.400
- I can tell you that with absolute certainty.
- No.

50:42.300 --> 50:45.000
- He's tired of me!
- You're wrong. You're wrong. I know.

50:45.200 --> 50:48.500
- How?
- Trust me. I know.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.900
- Sometimes you get a feel for people, and I get...
- My skin hurts!

50:51.800 --> 50:55.200
- What do you mean?
- I don't wanna...I hate the way I look!

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Don't do that!

50:58.100 --> 51:00.400
- Here. Take this.
- What is this?

51:00.300 --> 51:02.300
It's a Valium.
It'll make you feel better.

51:02.400 --> 51:04.600
- You carry medicine?
- No, not normally.

51:04.500 --> 51:06.400
It's just since I've been engaged to Inez,

51:06.300 --> 51:11.000
I've been having panic attacks,
but I'm sure they'll subside after the wedding.

51:10.900 --> 51:13.400
I've never heard of Valium.
What is this?

51:13.300 --> 51:16.800
It's the...pill of the future.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.900
You never said you were getting married.

51:22.800 --> 51:26.200
Yeah. You know,
it's still a....

51:26.100 --> 51:28.800
ways in the future.

51:28.900 --> 51:32.900
- Well, good luck with your book, and your wedding.
- Thank you.

51:32.900 --> 51:35.200
I think you'd like Inez.
She has a...

51:35.100 --> 51:37.700
has a very sharp sense of humor, and

51:37.600 --> 51:41.900
she's attractive. She doesn't say
that we agree on everything, but...

51:41.900 --> 51:44.000
But the important things.

51:43.900 --> 51:46.000
Yeah, or...actually,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
maybe the small things. The...

51:47.900 --> 51:51.400
Sometimes there's a little bit
of a disconnect with the big things.

51:51.200 --> 51:53.700
She wants to live in Malibu, and

51:53.600 --> 51:56.500
wants me to work in Hollywood, and....

51:57.000 --> 51:59.600
But I will say that we both like

52:00.000 --> 52:03.100
Indian food.
Not all Indian food, but the...

52:02.900 --> 52:05.000
you know...the pita bread.

52:04.900 --> 52:08.200
We both like pita bread.
I guess it's called naan.

52:09.500 --> 52:11.100
I should go.

52:11.400 --> 52:13.000
Pablo will be missing me.

52:12.900 --> 52:15.200
- Come on. I'll walk you home.
- No. No. No.

52:15.100 --> 52:17.500
Just finish your drink.
I live just around the corner.

52:17.400 --> 52:21.800
- No. Come on. I'm not gonna...
- Well, I...I...prefer to be by myself for a while,

52:21.600 --> 52:25.600
but thank you for the evening.
Bye.

52:27.900 --> 52:30.800
<i>Monsieur? C'est un dommage.
(Sir? It's a shame.)</i>

52:30.700 --> 52:32.700
<i>C'est un dommage.
(It's a shame.)</i>

52:33.100 --> 52:35.300
We met, earlier tonight...

52:35.600 --> 52:37.400
At the party!

52:37.800 --> 52:39.300
<i>DalÃ­, sÃ­?
(DalÃ­, yes?)</i>

52:39.300 --> 52:41.700
- Yes...
- DalÃ­!

52:41.600 --> 52:44.700
- I remember!
- DalÃ­. Ya.

52:44.800 --> 52:47.200
<i>Un bouteille de vin rouge!
(A bottle of red wine!)</i>

52:48.400 --> 52:51.400
It can't be...
Yeah....

52:51.800 --> 52:53.300
So?

52:54.000 --> 52:56.700
<i>Un autre verre pour monsieur, s'il vous plaÃ®t.
(Another glass for this man, please.)</i>

52:56.600 --> 52:59.300
I love the language!

52:59.200 --> 53:03.500
The French!
The waiters? No.

53:04.200 --> 53:07.800
You like the shape of the rhinoceros?

53:07.900 --> 53:10.600
The rhinoceros? Uh...

53:10.700 --> 53:13.300
Haven't really thought about it.

53:13.400 --> 53:17.800
I paint the rhinoceros.
I paint you.

53:17.600 --> 53:20.700
<i>SÃ­. Your sad eyes.</i>

53:20.700 --> 53:25.200
Your big lips, melting over the hot sand,

53:25.100 --> 53:27.400
with one tear.

53:27.300 --> 53:31.900
Yes! And in your tear,
another face.

53:31.700 --> 53:34.300
The Christ's face!

53:34.300 --> 53:37.400
Yes, in the rhinoceros.

53:37.400 --> 53:40.500
Yeah. I mean, I probably do look sad. I'm in...

53:40.400 --> 53:43.700
a very perplexing situation.

53:44.400 --> 53:48.600
<>Diablo...Luis! Oye, Luis!
(Damn. Luis! Hey, Luis!)

53:48.600 --> 53:51.000
My friends.

53:51.300 --> 53:53.800
This... SeÃ±or BuÃ±uel.

53:53.900 --> 53:57.800
- BuÃ±uel?
- SÃ­. BuÃ±uel...and...Mr. Man Ray.

53:57.700 --> 54:00.500
- Man Ray? My Gosh!
- How 'bout that?

54:00.400 --> 54:04.200
This is Pen-der. Pen-der.

54:04.400 --> 54:06.300
Pender!

54:06.200 --> 54:09.500
- Yes. And I am DalÃ­!
- DalÃ­. Yes.

54:09.300 --> 54:11.300
You have to remember.

54:11.600 --> 54:14.500
Pender is in a perplexing situation.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.500
It sounds so crazy to say.

54:17.400 --> 54:20.000
You guys are going to think I'm drunk, but

54:19.900 --> 54:22.000
I have to tell someone. I'm...

54:21.900 --> 54:23.900
from a...

54:23.800 --> 54:26.200
a different time. Another era.

54:26.100 --> 54:28.900
The future. OK? I come...

54:28.800 --> 54:31.700
from the 2000th millenium to here.

54:31.600 --> 54:35.500
I get in a car, and I slide through time.

54:35.300 --> 54:37.200
Exactly correct.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.300
You inhabit two worlds.

54:39.200 --> 54:42.100
- So far, I see nothing strange.
- Why?

54:42.000 --> 54:43.600
Yeah, you're surrealists!

54:43.500 --> 54:46.100
But I'm a normal guy.
See, in one life,

54:46.000 --> 54:48.500
I'm engaged to marry a woman I love.

54:48.400 --> 54:50.700
At least, I think I love her.

54:50.700 --> 54:53.300
Christ! I better love her!
I'm marrying her!

54:53.200 --> 54:55.700
The rhinoceros makes love

54:55.600 --> 54:58.300
by mounting the female.

54:58.300 --> 55:00.200
But...

55:00.100 --> 55:02.400
is there a difference

55:02.300 --> 55:05.900
in the beauty between two

55:05.700 --> 55:08.200
rhinoceroses?

55:08.200 --> 55:10.300
There is another woman?

55:10.200 --> 55:13.700
Adriana. Yes, and I'm...

55:13.800 --> 55:15.900
very drawn to her.

55:15.800 --> 55:19.100
I find her extremely alluring.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.700
The problem is that other men,

55:22.500 --> 55:26.500
great artists - geniuses -
also find her alluring,

55:26.400 --> 55:29.900
and she finds them.
So, there's that...

55:29.700 --> 55:33.700
A man in love with a woman
from a different era.

55:33.600 --> 55:35.400
I see a photograph.

55:35.400 --> 55:37.600
I see a film.

55:37.500 --> 55:40.600
I see an insurmountable problem.

55:40.600 --> 55:42.400
I see...

55:42.300 --> 55:45.200
...a rhinoceros.

55:45.100 --> 55:46.900
Did you get any work done last night?

55:46.800 --> 55:49.700
Yeah...I just....
I'm starting to think that maybe my

55:49.600 --> 55:51.200
book is too realistic.

55:51.100 --> 55:54.400
That I'm missing some chances
to let my imagination kind of

55:54.300 --> 55:58.600
go crazy, and not be so
damn logical.

55:58.500 --> 56:02.000
- Why do you always look so good in the morning?
- No. No. No. No!

56:01.800 --> 56:03.200
- We have to get dressed!
- Just for a second!

56:03.200 --> 56:07.200
Come here! I've been working like a demon.
I gotta get this stuff done, but

56:07.000 --> 56:11.500
I can't resist you any more.
You're so fetching in the morning.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.500
Paul said we have to go to the countryside.

56:13.500 --> 56:17.000
You know? He said he's taking us
to this beautiful little inn for lunch.

56:16.800 --> 56:20.100
But, I mean, if you don't want to go,
don't go.

56:20.200 --> 56:22.100
I'm not missing it because of you.

56:37.100 --> 56:41.300
<i>Hello! Bonjour!</i>

56:41.800 --> 56:44.800
- Hello! I have a quick question for you about Rodin.
- Hello.

56:45.100 --> 56:47.700
OK, now, I understand
he loved his wife

56:47.600 --> 56:49.800
and he also loved his mistress.

56:49.700 --> 56:51.400
- Yes.
- But do you think that's possible,

56:51.300 --> 56:53.300
to love two women at once?

56:53.400 --> 56:56.800
Well, he loved them both,
but in a different way.

56:56.800 --> 56:58.600
You know...

56:58.500 --> 57:00.900
That's very...
That's very French.

57:00.800 --> 57:03.600
You guys are way...
you know...much...

57:04.000 --> 57:06.400
more evolved in that department
than we are.

57:06.300 --> 57:08.600
Do you remember me?
I was in the...

57:08.500 --> 57:10.800
- was in the group that...
- Yes!

57:10.700 --> 57:13.100
The group with the pedantic gentleman.

57:13.000 --> 57:17.100
Pedantic? Yes.
That's a perfect word.

57:25.100 --> 57:28.300
Here is ... his photo.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.300
I want to know where
he goes each night.

57:30.800 --> 57:33.100
What is your suspicion? Hm?

57:33.000 --> 57:34.500
He's engaged to my daughter.

57:34.400 --> 57:37.400
To marry. I want to make sure
that she's making the right decision.

57:37.300 --> 57:39.700
Naturally, discretion is paramount.

57:39.700 --> 57:42.100
<i>Well, you've come to the
right place, Monsieur.</i>

57:42.000 --> 57:46.100
Monsieur Tisserant will personally
keep track of the gentleman,

57:45.900 --> 57:49.000
and report about his whereabouts at night.

58:08.400 --> 58:10.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey!

58:10.200 --> 58:13.000
Hey! Thank you for stopping.

58:13.100 --> 58:15.900
- Gil Pender.
- Tom Eliot.

58:15.800 --> 58:19.200
Tom Eliot?
Tom Stearns Eliot?

58:19.100 --> 58:22.400
T.S Eliot? T.S. Eliot?

58:22.800 --> 58:25.700
<i>- Pender.
- Prufrock's like my mantra!</i>

58:25.600 --> 58:27.600
OK. Sorry. Sorry.

58:33.700 --> 58:35.900
Listen. Where I come from,

58:35.800 --> 58:40.500
people measure out their lives
with coke spoons.

58:40.500 --> 58:43.000
- Hello? Ms. Stein?
- Oh, Pender.

58:42.900 --> 58:45.000
I'll get to your book in a moment.
I finished it.

58:44.900 --> 58:47.200
We're just in the middle
of a little personal crisis.

58:47.100 --> 58:49.700
Oh, OK. Should I come back?
I don't want to interrupt.

58:49.600 --> 58:51.700
No, it's no secret.

58:51.600 --> 58:55.100
Adriana has left Pablo,
and has flown to Africa with Hemingway.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.700
<i>SabÃ­a que tenÃ­a obsesiÃ³n con este fanfarrÃ³n!

58:59.100 --> 59:02.700
<i>Estoy segura de que ella regresarÃ¡ muy devoto.
(I'm sure that she'll come back very devoted.)</i>

59:02.500 --> 59:06.000
<i>Muy devoto. Oh, he took her hunting kudu,
but she'll be back to him.</i>

59:05.900 --> 59:10.800
The sound of hyenas in your ears at night when
you're trying to sleep in a tent just drives you crazy.

59:10.600 --> 59:13.000
Mount Kilimanjaro is not Paris.

59:13.000 --> 59:16.300
- What are you saying, that he took her to Mount Kilimanjaro?
- Now, about your book,

59:16.400 --> 59:18.100
it's very unusual, indeed.

59:18.100 --> 59:21.800
I mean, in a way, it's almost like science fiction.

59:21.600 --> 59:25.300
We all fear death,
and question our place in the universe.

59:25.200 --> 59:28.600
The artist's job is not to succumb to despair,

59:28.400 --> 59:32.100
but to find an antidote for
the emptiness of existence.

59:32.200 --> 59:36.600
You have a clear and lively voice.
Don't be such a defeatist.

59:38.100 --> 59:43.300
Tell Gil to bring his suit, 'cause we're
going to be dining formal tomorrow night.

59:43.100 --> 59:47.000
I forgot to tell you, actually.
Gil isn't coming to Mont Saint-Michel.

59:46.900 --> 59:49.600
Why not?
I don't understand it!

59:49.400 --> 59:51.400
Because, he writes.
He rewrites.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.400
He rewrites the rewrites, you know?

59:53.300 --> 59:55.100
He says, "Picasso never left his studio."

59:55.000 --> 59:57.900
I said, "Gil, you have absolutely
nothing in common with Picasso."

59:57.800 --> 59:59.600
He just looks at me.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.700
Well, he's gonna miss a great weekend.

Yeah. You seem a bit young

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.600
It's because he wrote
many songs about Paris.

Yeah. What was the story? It was like he was
in love with your hometown, or something.

01:01:56.300 --> 01:02:01.800
"Pablo is the greater artist,
but Matisse is the greater painter."

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:06.400
"Paris in the summer.
What it must have been like,"

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:11.200
"to sit opposite one's
lover at Maxim's, in its..."

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:14.500
"in its...um...best time."

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.900
"I'm in love with an American
writer I just met,"

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.800
"named Gil Pender."

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:28.500
"That immediate magic one hears
about happened to me."

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:33.200
"I know that both Picasso and
Hemingway are in love with me,"

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.500
<i>"but for whatever...inexplicable..."</i>

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:41.100
<i>- inexplicable...reason...the heart has,
- Yes. Yes.</i>

01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:43.300
"I am drawn by Gil."

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:48.200
"Perhaps because he seems naÃ¯ve and unassuming."

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.800
"As always in this sad life,"

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.600
"he's about to marry a woman named Inez."

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.500
"I had a dream where he came to me"

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.700
"and brought me a little gift.
Earrings, they were,"

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.100
"and we made love."

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Earrings...

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:55.600
Earrings....

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:05.400
Whoa! Oh my God!
What are you guys doing?

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.200
Daddy had chest pains.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.400
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just indigestion.

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.900
- We can't take that chance.
- You know he had an angioplasty 3 years ago.

01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.300
Yeah. Right.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:17.200
They put a balloon in me.
Big deal.

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:20.900
- Balloon?
- I would like the hotel doctor, please, in room 728.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.000
Don't call the doctor!

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.600
Gil, why are you so dressed up?

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.400
Me? No, no, no, I'm not.
I've been writing.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.100
I was just doing a little writing.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.300
Wh...You dress up and
put on cologne to write?

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.100
No, no. I jumped in the shower,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.900
just for a second. You know
how I think better in the shower,

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.500
and I get the positive ions going in there?

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.100
So, we were halfway to Mont Saint-Michel

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.400
when Daddy just...
he went pale as a ghost.

01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.500
- That's terrible!
- I mean, it was so scary, so we just

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:47.900
- turned right around and came back.
- Yeah. You had to.

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.700
John, is there anything I can get,
for your color to me looks

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.000
- like it's OK, but I'm not a doctor.
- Naw, I'm fine.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.500
I'm sure it's the
beef bourguignon she made me have.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:59.200
- What is that?
- Where?

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.300
- That in your hand.
- Nothing.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.700
- That was a present!
- I know. I know.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.400
I mean, it's not...It...It is!

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.500
<i>- Pour moi? (For me?)
- Yes.</i>

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:11.400
It's not...incredible....
It's from the flea market.

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.700
- Well, can I open it?
- No, no no,

01:05:12.700 --> 01:05:17.300
That's what I'm saying.
Honey, it's for a special dinner

01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.100
that we're gonna have,
then I'm going to give it to you.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.500
- Is it jewelry? I hope it's my taste, if it's jewelry, because...
- Well...

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:26.900
- ...that moonstone necklace?
- But I thought you liked the moon?

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.700
Because it's understated, but elegant.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.500
That's what you always say.

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.800
Cheap is cheap,
is what I always say.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.300
Yeah. You didn't see this necklace.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.000
I've never actually even worn it.
I'll show you. You'll see why immediately.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.600
- Everybody's down on moonstone, all of a sudden.
- Well...

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:45.100
- they are...
- A little simple.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.500
I think... I thought
you loved their simplicity.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.900
Yeah, that's the problem.
They're too simple.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.700
Well, what do I know?
Too simple.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.900
Where are my pearl earrings?

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.500
Did...Did you bring them?

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.000
I don't even remember you packing them.

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.600
Yes, I did, because I've worn them here!

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.900
No, you didn't.
Oh, they must've fallen out!

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.400
Both of them?
Gil, my ears are pierced.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.500
Inez, I told you to keep
everything in the hotel safe!

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.900
- Do you think it was the maid?
- It's always the maid.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.800
I...I know I saw them
here this morning.

01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.100
Well, I would report the theft right away.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.400
You know, she was so snotty
yesterday when I asked her...

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's not
jump to any conclusions, OK?

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.800
- You don't just level a charge of theft against somebody.
- Yes, I'd like to report a theft.

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:30.000
- Shh, Inez, no!
- Could you call the house detective?

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.300
- Send him up. Thank you.
- This is turning into a witch hunt!

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.100
You don't do this to people!

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.600
Yes, you do,
if they've stolen.

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.200
I didn't like that maid.
I didn't like her from the beginning.

01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:40.700
She was sweet. She was pleasant.
She was upbeat!

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.300
You always take the
side of the help, as usual!

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.800
That's why Daddy says you're a communist.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.200
<i>Bon soir. (Good evening.)
I'm Doctor GÃ©rard.</i>

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.500
- Do you want some more water?
- I'm fine.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:56.800
- He's had angioplasty.
- I didn't need it.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.000
Look! Are these them?

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:03.900
I don't know.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.200
- Where did you find them?
- They were just in the bathroom.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.100
- In the bathroom?
- Yeah. On the sink.

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.200
What the hell were they
doing in the bathroom?

01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:14.300
I don't know.
They were just...

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:17.500
But maybe you dropped them, and

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.600
when you were putting them away,
and the housekeeper must've picked them up.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.300
and placed them there, out in
the open where we could see them easily.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.200
That was really thoughtful of her.

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.000
I didn't drop them.
I wouldn't drop them.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.900
The important thing is
they're not stolen.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.600
<i>C'est l'un de vos meilleurs, jusqu'au prÃ©sent.
(It's one of your best, until now.)</i>

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.100
<i>J'ai parlÃ© Ã  Leo. Je pense qu'il va l'acheter
(I talked to Leo. I think that he'll buy it.)</i>

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.300
Oh, Pender!
I was just telling Matisse

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.600
we're going to buy one of his
paintings for our personal collection.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.800
I think 500 Francs is fair.

01:08:08.900 --> 01:08:11.100
500 Francs for a Matisse?

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.900
Yeah, I think that sounds fair.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:15.400
You know, I was wondering if
maybe I could pick up 6 or 7.

01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:17.200
- What have we got here?
- Yeah. Oh.

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.000
OK, now, I've brought a rewrite over
of the first few chapters of my book,

01:08:19.899 --> 01:08:24.300
and if you could just tell me if I'm
heading in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.000
- Leave it with me.
- OK. Great.

01:08:25.899 --> 01:08:27.800
and have you heard from Hemingway?

01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.100
Oh, they've been back for days, now.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.300
The trip didn't work out.
I knew they wouldn't hit it off.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.200
It's over. With Picasso, too.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.600
She's at Deyrolle, by herself.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.399
By herself?

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:41.399
Oh, one of those crazy
Surrealist painters is getting married.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.200
They're doing it up there.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.399
She'll be glad to see you.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:50.300
<i>Eh bien, mes chers amies, je propose de porter un toast...
(Well, my dear friends, I propose to raise a toast to...)</i>

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:20.800
Oh. What are you doing here?

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.700
I came to find you.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.700
- You did?
- Yeah. Maybe this is coming out of left field, but

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:30.300
let's just say, as a writer,
I'm pretty good at

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.100
picking up on vibrations from people-
women in particular.

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:38.500
I sense that there are
some complicated feelings, maybe,

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.200
that you have for me.

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.300
Aren't you gonna get married?

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.100
Well, everything's a little
up in the air right now.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.800
I don't know what is gonna happen.

01:09:48.899 --> 01:09:52.200
Is there some place that we
can talk? Maybe more quiet?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.600
- Sure.
- Come on.

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:56.900
Oh, Mr. BuÃ±uel!

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.300
I had a nice idea
for a movie for you.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.700
- Yes?
- A group of people attend a

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:07.200
very formal dinner party. At the end of dinner,
when they try to leave the room, they can't.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.100
Why not?

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.500
They just can't seem to exit the door.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
<i>- B...But why?
- Well, momento,</i>

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.000
when they're forced to stay together,
the veneer of civilization

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:22.600
quickly fades away,
and what you're left with is

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.500
who they really are:  animals.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.200
But I don't get it.

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.100
Why don't they just
walk out of the room?

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.600
All I'm saying is just think about.
Who knows?

01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:34.200
Maybe when you're shaving one day,
it'll tickle your fancy.

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:38.000
I don't understand.
What's holding them in the room?

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:16.700
What are you doing?

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.400
I don't know!

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.800
I did feel,
for a minute there,

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:33.800
while I was doing it, like I was immortal.

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.100
But you look so sad.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.400
Because life is too mysterious.

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.800
This is the time we live in.

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:44.700
Everything moves so fast.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.400
Life is noisy and complicated.

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:52.000
I've always been a logical person.
I've never

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.500
I never acted too crazy.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.000
I didn't stay here.
When I first came out here,

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.900
I didn't take a real shot at being a writer.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.700
I'd just, kind of, be a hired Hollywood hand.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.700
Don't laugh. I just want to...

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.700
I feel like I just want to let it go.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.900
- Here.
- Oh!

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.800
Oh! This is...
This is remarkable!

01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:24.200
Go on. Here, put in on.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.100
They're so beautiful!

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:34.300
Look!

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:41.600
<i>Monsieur, Mademoiselle, on y va!
(Sir, Miss, away we go!)</i>

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:45.600
<i>- Qui est vous? (Who are you?)
- Allez monter. Nous allons trop tard. (Come up. We're too late)</i>

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.700
<i>- Allez!
- Come on! Come on!</i>

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:08.100
<i>Oh, mon Dieu,
this is so beautiful!</i>

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.800
It's unbelievable!
All the pictures I've seen...

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.600
<i>Here it is: La Belle Ãpoque!</i>

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.200
Wow! I don't know
what it is about this city!

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.300
It's like, I've got to write a note
to the Chamber of Commerce.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.900
<i>Bon soir!
(Good evening!)</i>

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.100
<i>Bon soir! Bienvenue.
(Good evening! Welcome.)</i>

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Thank you.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.900
<i>Oh, mon Dieu! Quelle robe magnifique!
(Oh, my God! What a magnificent dress!)</i>

01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:36.500
<i>Tellement avant-garde!
(So ahead of the time!)</i>

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:42.500
<i>S'il vous plaÃ®t, prenez un boire du champagne. C'est la fÃªte!
(Please, have a drink of champagne. It's a party!)</i>

01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.800
<i>Champagne.</i>

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.300
Isn't it amazing? The first time we met,
I told you about this place,

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:18.100
<i>and the Belle Ãpoque,</i>

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.000
and here we are!

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:22.900
I don't know why,
but I have this feeling that...

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.800
I don't know, like I can't...

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.300
believe my luck.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.100
Well, I can. I know exactly where I want to go next.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.900
You lead the way.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.100
Look!

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.700
Oh, my God!

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.400
Pablo admires him so much!

01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.400
- I have to say hello.
- No, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.100
- Come with me! I'm nervous.
- Really? OK.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.400
But, we know he's a lonely man.

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:27.400
- I'm sure he would love some company.
- OK, let's go.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.000
Monsieur Lautrec?

01:15:30.900 --> 01:15:34.100
<i>- Oui? (Yes?)
- Bon soir. Nous sommes de grands amateurs.(Good evening. We are great fans.)</i>

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:37.500
<i>- Merci, Madame. (Thank you, Madame.)
- Pouvons-nous vous offrir un verre? (May we offer you a drink?)</i>

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:41.000
<i>Je serais enchantÃ©e. Prenez un siÃ¨ge.
(I would be delighted. Have a seat.)</i>

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:42.900
He's asking us to sit down with him.

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.300
This much French I do
understand, and the gesture.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.300
<i>Vous Ãªtes Americain?
(You are American?)</i>

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.800
Yes, I'm an American.

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:52.000
<i>Je vous devine Ã  l'accent.(I could tell from the accent.)
- Yeah. Oui. Oui.</i>

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:55.400
<i>Vos dessins! Votre attention! Nous admirons tout que vous faites.
(Your drawings! Your attention! We admire everything that you do.)</i>

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.700
<i>- I love your drawings, also.
- Bon soir!
- Merci.</i>

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.900
<i>Savez que moi je prÃ©senter Monsieur Gauginand Monsieur Degas.
(May I present Mr. Gaugin and Mr. Degas.)</i>

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:06.600
- Bon soir.
- EnchantÃ©e.
- Bon soir. EnchantÃ©e.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:11.200
- Paul Gaugin.
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.100
See the sketch he's made?
Nobody can draw like this today.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Not Picasso. Not Matisse.

01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:18.200
<i>Unbelievable. Parlez-vous anglais?</i>

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:20.100
<i>- Non, monsieur. (No, sir.)
- Il parle un petit peu.(He speaks a little.)</i>

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:24.200
<i>Non, non. I speak well. Parle trÃ¨s bien. Bien oui. Tu veut voir? 
(No, no. I speak very well. Absolutely. You want to see?)</i>

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:27.500
Degas and I were just
talking about how this...

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:32.900
<i>um...this...cette...gÃ©nÃ©ration est plus vide, et il manque d'imagination.
(...this generation is empty, and is missing imagination.)</i>

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.900
He said...He says that

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:39.300
this generation is empty,
and has no imagination.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:43.400
<i>Better to have lived during the...
la Renaissance.</i>

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.300
No! This is the golden age.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.800
<i>- Non.
- C'est l'Ã¢ge d'or!(It's the golden age!)</i>

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.600
<i>Pas de tout. La Renaissance, c'est beaucoup mieux.
(Not at all. The Renaissance is much better.)</i>

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.600
<i>Qu'est-ce que vous faites dans la vie?
(What is it you do?)</i>

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:56.100
<i>J'Ã©tudie la haute-couture.
(I study high fashion.)</i>

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.200
<i>C'est pour Ã§a vous Ãªtes ****(That's why you're dressed like that.)</i>

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.500
<i>Je comprends maintenant!
(I understand now!)</i>

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.400
<i>Les vÃªtements tres jeune.
(The youthful clothes.)</i>

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.600
<i>Voulez vous de lui prÃ©senter Ã  Richard?
(Would you introduce her to Richard?)</i>

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:11.000
<i>- Ah, oui! (Oh, yes!)
- Ah, oui. He wants to have you meet his friend Richard.</i>

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.300
He's looking for someone
to do costumes for the new ballet.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.700
<i>So, vous intÃ©resse?
(So, you're interested?)</i>

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.600
- Ballet costumes?
- Yes.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.300
Oh my God! I...

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.400
I don't live here.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.100
I mean, I do, but I don't. I...

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.200
It's best not to go
into too many details. We're...

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.100
We're temporarily
passing through.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.700
Can I speak with you a minute?

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500
<i>PermitÃ©e?
(May I?)</i>

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.200
<i>EnchantÃ©..</i>

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.400
Wow, it didn't take
Gaugin long to start steaming in.

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.500
Let's never go back to the '20s!

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:46.400
- What are you talking about?
- We should stay here.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.900
It's the start of La Belle Ãpoque!

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:53.600
It's the greatest, most
beautiful era Paris has ever known.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.300
Yeah, but about the '20s,
and the Charleston,

01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.200
and the Fitzgeralds,
and the Hemingways?

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.500
I mean, I love those guys.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:05.400
But it's the present.
It's dull.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:07.500
Dull?

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.800
It's not my present.

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.000
I'm from 2010.

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.400
What do you mean?

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:20.700
I dropped in on you the same way
we're dropping in on the 1890s.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:22.900
You did?

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.400
I was trying to escape my present
the same way you're trying to escape yours,

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:28.300
to a golden age.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:33.200
Surely you don't think
the '20s are a golden age!

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.500
Well, yeah. To me they are.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.700
But I'm from the '20s, and I'm
telling you the golden age is La Belle Ãpoque.

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:44.900
And look at these guys. I mean, to them,
their golden age was the Renaissance.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:49.200
<i>You know, they're trade Belle Ãpoque
to be painting alongside</i>

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:50.800
Titian and Michelango.

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.800
And those guys probably imagined

01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:55.700
life was a lot better
when Kublai Khan was around.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.500
You see, I'm having an insight right now.
It's a minor one, but

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:02.600
it explains the anxiety in my dream that I had.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.100
- What dream?
- I had a dream the other night, where

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.700
it was like a nightmare,
where I ran out of Zithromax.

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:10.800
And then I went to the dentist,
and he didn't have any Novocaine.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.600
You see what I'm saying?

01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:16.100
These people don't have any antibiotics.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.200
What are you talking about?

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:21.400
Adriana, if you stay here,
and this becomes your present,

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:26.500
then, pretty soon, you'll start
imagining another time was really your,

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:28.600
you know, was really the golden time.

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.800
That's what the present is.

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:35.400
That it's a little unsatisfying,
because life's a little unsatisfying.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:38.300
That's the problem with writers.

01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.700
You are so full of words.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.300
But I am more emotional,

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.900
and I'm going stay,

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:48.900
and live in Paris' most glorious time.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.800
You made a choice to leave
Paris once, and you regretted it.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:55.000
Yeah, I did regret it.
It was a bad decision,

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.200
but at least it was a choice.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.900
I mean, it was a real choice.
This way, I think, is,

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:02.300
I don't know, crazy.
It doesn't really work.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.200
If I ever want to write
something worthwhile, I have to,

01:20:06.100 --> 01:20:09.200
you know, get rid of my
illusions, and then I'd be

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.500
happier in the past,
as where I want a home.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.300
So...

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.100
Goodbye, Gil?

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.600
Goodbye.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.400
Pender, I read your rewrite,
and you're nicely on the right track.

01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.100
You understood me clearly.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.100
If the rest of the book
reads as well when you're done,

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.500
- you'll have something of value.
- That is the best news!

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:44.800
I really did listen to you,
so I'm happy to hear that it

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.300
You know, it seems like I'm
moving forward.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.000
I mean, it just means
the world to me that you

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.000
- Hemingway read the chapters, too, and he thinks...
- He read it?

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.900
...he thinks it's going to be a fine book.

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:55.000
but he did have one plot suggestion.

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.100
What's the suggestion?

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Well, he doesn't quite believe
that the protagonist

01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:02.400
doesn't see that his fiancÃ©e is
having an affair right before his eyes.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:05.800
- With?
- The other character. The pedantic one.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.700
That's called denial.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.600
Thank you.

01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:17.800
You're crazy!

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:19.700
Paul and I?

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.300
Where did you get such an insane notion?

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.200
Where? From Ernest Hemingway.

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:27.000
He figured it out, and, guess what,
it makes perfect sense.

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:28.900
Gil, your brain tumor's acting up again.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.300
- No. No!
- There's nothing crazy about Hemingway,

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.100
or Fitzgerald, or Gertrude Stein,
or Salvador DalÃ­!

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.500
Yeah, except that they've been dead for years!

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:38.300
No, no. The past is not dead.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.000
Actually, it's not even past.
You know who said that?

01:21:40.900 --> 01:21:43.000
Faulkner. And he was right.
And I met him, too.

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:44.400
I ran into him at a dinner party.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.200
- You're a raving lunatic!
- No, I'm not.

01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.400
- Yes, you are.
- No. I'm too trusting.

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.300
I'm jealous,
and I'm trusting.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:51.800
It's cognitive dissonance.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.100
- Scott Fitzgerald talked about it.
- Gil. Gil.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.800
Inez, you can fool me,
but you cannot fool Hemingway.

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:58.600
- I know.
- Jesus Christ, I'm dealing with a madman here.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:01.000
OK. Yes! I did.

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:03.400
I was with Paul for a few nights,

01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:06.600
because he's romantic,
and he speaks French,

01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:11.000
and you were always working, and maybe it's
the mystique of this corny city, but...

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.800
get over it, Gil.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.900
You just put this in perspective
when we get home.

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:19.700
I'm not...I'm not going back.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:23.600
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm staying here, and it has nothing to do with,

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:26.200
you know, your romantic fling;
Paris is Paris.

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.400
Inez, you and I, it's obvious we're not...

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.800
I don't think we're right for each other.

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.800
What?

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.700
What are you saying?

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:38.400
What are you even talking about?

01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.800
- You ready to go swimming?
- Hi!

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:44.300
We're breaking up.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.400
- What?
- Yeah. Gil's moving to Paris.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.300
- I knew it. I told you.
- What's going on?

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.000
No, no, I'm going to stay in Paris, but

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:52.400
just because we're...

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.200
If I'm unhappy, I'll move back.
But for the time being, yes.

01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.700
W...W...With who?...
With who, Gil?

01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.300
- No one, I...
- One of your crazy hallucinatory friends?

01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.200
I mean, Mom's right about you.

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:04.000
You have this part missing.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.400
Yeah, I said that first.

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:07.600
Anyone whose protagonist
makes a living

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:10.900
selling old cap pistols
and Joan Crawford cutout books...

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.500
- Honestly...
- Look, I'm not trying to be

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:16.100
a martyr, but I think
you'll be better off without me.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.700
- I really do.
- But we would!

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.700
- I can't believe you're moving.
- Go ahead. Go ahead!

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:26.800
Walk the streets. Gush over the
Parisian light and the rooftops.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.600
Goodbye, Inez.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.500
- Say hi to Trotsky.
- Yeah.

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:36.200
- Unbelievable!
- You know, I had...

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:40.000
a private detective follow him.
I knew he was up to no good.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:42.000
- You did?
- You bet I did.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
He saw him get into a car
at midnight every night,

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.900
and he followed him very closely.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:49.100
- And what happened?
- I don't know.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.100
The detective agency says
the detective is missing.

01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:55.100
<i>Ã qui dois-je l'honneur?
(To whom do I owe the honor?)</i>

01:23:55.100 --> 01:23:57.600
<i>Je...Je suis perdu.
(I...I'm lost.)</i>

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.500
<i>J'ai detournÃ©e la mauvaise endroit.
(I made a wrong turn.)</i>

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.600
<i>Gardes! Gardes!
(Guards! Guards!)</i>

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:04.500
<i>Lui coupe la tÃªte!
(Off with his head!)</i>

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.400
<i>Lui coupe la tÃªte!
(Off with his head!)</i>

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:13.500
- Hey! Hi!
- Hey!

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.900
Wow! What...

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:20.000
Good to see you.

01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.900
What are you doing here?

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:24.000
I'm returning from dinner with friends.

01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:25.900
- Oh. OK.
- I live here.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:28.900
And you? What are you doing here?

01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:31.200
I was just out for a walk.

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:34.300
Yeah, I'm actually...I decided.
I'm moving to Paris.

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:37.800
- Really? Wow. I'm sure you will love it.
- Yeah.

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.500
- Yeah. You think so?
- Yeah.

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.800
You know, I thought about
you the other day.

01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:44.500
- Really?
- Yeah, because

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:48.100
my boss got a whole
new album of Cole Porter songs.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.300
That made you think about me?

01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.200
I like to be thought of that way.

01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:57.300
You're on your way home right now?

01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:59.100
Yes.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.300
Can I walk with you,
or, I'll buy you a cup of coffee?

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.100
Oh, OK, now it's starting to rain.

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:10.900
No, but that's OK.
I don't mind getting wet.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.800
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.300
Actually, Paris is the most beautiful in the rain.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:20.400
I feel that's what
I'm always saying.

01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:22.900
I couldn't agree more with you.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:26.100
Yes, it is more beautiful.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.800
By the way, my name is Gabrielle.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.900
- Gil.
- Nice to meet you.

01:26:30.900 --> 01:26:34.000
That's a pretty name.
