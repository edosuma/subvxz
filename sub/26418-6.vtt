I'm telling you it's hard
out here for a vampire.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.971
I try to get a tan
for the ladies,

14:02.015 --> 14:03.233
but they only come running

14:03.277 --> 14:05.453
because they think they smell
fried chicken!

14:05.496 --> 14:06.497
Boom!

14:06.541 --> 14:07.716
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

14:07.759 --> 14:09.544
What do you know about
being one of them!

14:09.587 --> 14:11.459
I'm Count Laughula!

14:11.502 --> 14:12.199
You're a hack!

14:12.242 --> 14:14.027
Playing dress-up.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.202
Hey, look pal, I'm just
trying to-

14:15.245 --> 14:16.159
Trying to what?

14:17.508 --> 14:18.422
Trying to what?

14:18.466 --> 14:20.685
Feeders aren't funny.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.470
You wanna know what it's like
being one of them?

14:22.513 --> 14:23.210
Phil-

14:23.253 --> 14:24.472
I used to-

14:24.515 --> 14:25.603
He-hey-hey! They wanna know,
they wanna know!

14:25.647 --> 14:26.909
Yeah, we do!

14:26.953 --> 14:29.085
Feeders aren't funny,

14:29.129 --> 14:31.000
and I should know
because I used to be one-

14:31.044 --> 14:32.436
Oh, yeah?

14:32.480 --> 14:36.614
Well, uh, I don't recall seeing
you hanging around!

14:36.658 --> 14:37.920
Boom-boom!

14:37.964 --> 14:39.052
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

14:39.095 --> 14:41.097
You wanna know
what it feels like?

14:42.969 --> 14:44.927
The first thing is the hunger-

14:44.971 --> 14:47.538
that's the first thing
that you feel.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.410
It's intense.

14:49.453 --> 14:52.935
It's intense and
it's so painful,

14:52.979 --> 14:55.938
and it fuels your anger
and your hatred,

14:55.982 --> 15:00.029
it's relentless and no matter
how much you feed,

15:00.073 --> 15:04.033
you want more, and
you'll do anything-

15:04.077 --> 15:06.079
anything!

15:06.122 --> 15:11.171
I did unspeakable things.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.563
Like what?

15:14.652 --> 15:15.653
You wanna know?

15:15.697 --> 15:17.220
You really wanna know?

15:22.095 --> 15:24.619
I fed on my own children.

15:24.662 --> 15:26.534
So how'd they taste?

15:29.841 --> 15:31.974
How'd they taste?

15:32.018 --> 15:37.153
á*áá*á you, that's how
they tasted.

15:37.197 --> 15:42.158
And then I forced their mother,
my wife, to watch.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.594
And then I just left her there,
I didn't kill her,

15:43.638 --> 15:53.648
I didn't turn her, I got off
on her pain, suffering.

15:54.214 --> 15:59.654
And then, I went off to feed.

16:04.093 --> 16:07.053
And I didn't feel a thing.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.580
Not a thing.

16:12.623 --> 16:15.235
Now they're gone.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.541
There's nothin' I can do.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.720
Well, maybe there is something
I can do about it.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.766
So do it already.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.472
[gasps]

16:35.516 --> 16:36.996
[gunshot]

16:38.171 --> 16:39.215
Oh, shit!

16:39.259 --> 16:40.608
Phil!

17:00.236 --> 17:01.846
What's he doin'?

17:22.780 --> 17:24.826
Now that's funny!

17:24.869 --> 17:27.524
[laughter]

17:27.568 --> 17:29.352
[applause]

17:29.396 --> 17:33.139
[laughter]

17:34.662 --> 17:38.840
[cheering and applause]

18:03.212 --> 18:04.822
Oh, it's just you!

18:04.866 --> 18:06.215
Nice to see you, too.

18:06.259 --> 18:07.695
Oh, I'm sorry, that's not
what I meant, Jolene.

18:07.738 --> 18:11.612
I'm just feeling a little
frustrated right now, you know?

18:11.655 --> 18:13.614
Like, haven't been able to get
anywhere with this blood

18:13.657 --> 18:15.833
that Scarlett gave me
and the truth is,

18:15.877 --> 18:17.052
I don't know what
I'm looking for-

18:17.096 --> 18:18.314
No-no-no,

18:18.358 --> 18:21.709
I'm sorry, no, clearly
you're too busy, right,

18:21.752 --> 18:23.667
and I wasn't
just attacked again,

18:23.711 --> 18:25.147
but, you know,
forget about it-

18:25.191 --> 18:26.105
Attacked again?

18:26.148 --> 18:27.410
Hey!

18:27.454 --> 18:28.455
No, it's just- alright,
don't worry about it,

18:28.498 --> 18:29.369
it's alright.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.196
Hey, Jolene,
what's going on-

18:30.239 --> 18:32.154
Don't touch me!

18:32.198 --> 18:34.896
What the-- was that?!

18:34.939 --> 18:38.160
I don't know.

18:38.204 --> 18:38.943
I'm sorry, Sarah-

18:38.987 --> 18:40.336
No! No.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.730
I don't know, that wasn't me.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.256
I'm sorry.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.477
[sigh]

18:50.520 --> 18:53.219
[door close]

18:53.262 --> 18:55.569
The hell was that?

18:59.050 --> 19:01.009
Let me guess- two more?

19:05.361 --> 19:07.972
How's your friend?

19:08.016 --> 19:09.104
He's good.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.194
Just went home to sleep it off.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.805
That was quite a performance
he gave.

19:14.849 --> 19:18.331
Yeah, he's unpredictable,
I guess.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.941
He's been through a rough time.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.726
I mean, haven't we all?

19:22.770 --> 19:24.989
It's his way of dealing with it-

19:25.033 --> 19:28.079
acting out what it would be like
to be one of' em.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.604
Vampire, I mean.

19:30.647 --> 19:33.433
Right, so, that bullet hole
in the wall over there,

19:33.476 --> 19:36.697
that's just part of the act?

19:36.740 --> 19:39.700
I mean, that must've been
there before.

19:39.743 --> 19:41.092
I mean, like you said,
back in the day,

19:41.136 --> 19:45.314
it was pretty crazy here.

19:45.358 --> 19:49.318
So is it true?
What he said?

19:49.362 --> 19:51.320
The part about havin' a family?

19:53.627 --> 19:55.455
Yeah.

19:55.498 --> 19:58.806
He had a family.

19:58.849 --> 20:00.677
Oh, well if any of them
are still alive,

20:00.721 --> 20:02.853
they might be on the registry.

20:05.073 --> 20:06.770
What registry?

20:22.308 --> 20:23.831
[clang sound]

20:25.876 --> 20:28.227
I know you're there, Barry.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.448
How'd you know?

20:32.492 --> 20:35.930
You're about as stealthy
as a Clydesdale.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.323
What are you doing here?

20:37.366 --> 20:39.629
I wanna help-
help save your friend.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.152
It's too dangerous.

20:41.196 --> 20:43.938
I'm not afraid.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.288
Yeah, I know, Barry, okay,
and I appreciate that,

20:46.332 --> 20:47.594
but it's gonna take
more than bravery

20:47.637 --> 20:50.249
and that pipe to make it
outta this alive.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.992
What's over in that direction?

20:55.036 --> 20:56.298
That's Chinatown.

20:56.342 --> 20:57.952
You shouldn't go there.

20:57.995 --> 20:59.997
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

21:00.041 --> 21:01.695
I saw you lick that blood.

21:01.738 --> 21:04.175
Is that how you do it?
How you find' em?

21:04.219 --> 21:05.351
[sigh]

21:05.394 --> 21:07.048
Yeah, it's how I focus.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.006
Makes me strong.

21:10.573 --> 21:11.835
What are you doing?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.576
Barry, no!

21:16.405 --> 21:18.233
Here, to help beat that thing!

21:18.277 --> 21:20.975
Barry, you need to go.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.933
What you mean?

21:22.977 --> 21:24.674
Barry, you need to get
the fuck out of here

21:24.718 --> 21:26.285
or I'm gonna kill you!

21:27.634 --> 21:28.939
Go!

21:31.464 --> 21:32.682
Just wanted to help.

21:33.596 --> 21:34.771
Just wanted to help.

21:36.904 --> 21:41.604
[heavy breathing]

22:01.929 --> 22:04.061
Per your request,
one repellant shot.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.150
Great, thank you.

22:06.194 --> 22:08.065
What do you need
that for anyway?

22:17.858 --> 22:19.250
[Door shut]

22:42.883 --> 22:44.232
Date is-

22:45.712 --> 22:48.410
[laughing]

22:48.454 --> 22:49.585
I dunno!

22:49.629 --> 22:53.154
Uh, time is 3:42 pm.

22:53.197 --> 22:55.852
Test subject A has been given
an elevated dose

22:55.896 --> 22:59.334
in hope of speeding up,
uh, incubation time.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.033
Test subject B has been
given no dose

23:03.077 --> 23:05.732
and will act as our control.

23:20.137 --> 23:23.967
[squeaking]

23:38.939 --> 23:40.462
Oh, my God!

23:47.948 --> 23:48.992
It's the shots!

23:49.036 --> 23:50.385
Jesus Christ,
what are you doing!

23:50.429 --> 23:51.647
It's the shots, Jo!

23:51.691 --> 23:53.388
They're what's causing
these violent outbursts.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.737
It's why you nearly bit
my head off.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.260
It's the shots!

23:56.304 --> 23:59.438
But that's- what-
are you sure?

23:59.481 --> 24:02.223
Oh, yeah- I'm 100 percent sure.

24:02.266 --> 24:03.746
Then we have to tell someone.

24:03.790 --> 24:05.835
No- we have to tell everyone.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.625
Hello?

24:12.668 --> 24:13.974
Oh, hey there!

24:14.017 --> 24:15.454
How can I help you?

24:15.497 --> 24:17.760
Yeah, I'm looking for your
population registry,

24:17.804 --> 24:19.936
I was told I might be able
to find someone.

24:19.980 --> 24:23.331
Well, if they pass
through Denver,

24:23.374 --> 24:25.159
they'd be on it.

24:25.202 --> 24:29.250
Wow, so, the names of all the
people that survived the rising-

24:29.293 --> 24:30.164
they're in here?

24:30.207 --> 24:32.296
You bet.

24:32.340 --> 24:33.689
Great!

24:37.171 --> 24:40.957
You lookin' for anyone special?

24:41.001 --> 24:44.004
Uh, yeah, a friend's wife.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.180
Ooh, let me guess.

24:46.223 --> 24:50.010
Friend no longer in the picture,
you always had a thing for her,

24:50.053 --> 24:51.925
now you see your chance.

24:51.968 --> 24:53.622
What?

24:53.666 --> 24:56.233
No! No!

24:56.277 --> 24:57.757
No?

24:57.800 --> 25:00.760
Well, fill your boots.

25:07.723 --> 25:09.420
[sigh]

25:09.464 --> 25:10.247
Damnit!

25:10.291 --> 25:12.162
No luck?

25:12.206 --> 25:14.121
No.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.252
Thanks anyway.

25:15.296 --> 25:17.994
Don't wanna check
the other volumes?

25:18.038 --> 25:20.214
There's other volumes?

25:26.960 --> 25:29.832
The lapse time post injection
was less than a minute.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.138
What was the dosage?

25:31.181 --> 25:33.444
Ten times the regulated amount,
give or take,

25:33.488 --> 25:34.881
but depending on a person's
tolerance,

25:34.924 --> 25:36.578
there's no say what
a safe dosage is

25:36.622 --> 25:38.014
or if there even is one.

25:38.058 --> 25:40.626
It has to be the cause
of these violent outbursts.

25:40.669 --> 25:42.279
This is not news.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.194
Of course there
are side effects,

25:44.238 --> 25:48.329
but the fact is, the shots work,
which means people feel safe.

25:48.372 --> 25:51.288
And when people feel safe,
they stay calm, happy.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.116
Wait, you're saying you knew?

25:53.160 --> 25:54.465
This whole time?

25:54.509 --> 25:55.815
No one is saying what we have
here is perfect,

25:55.858 --> 25:57.643
but it's a lot better
than outside these walls.

25:57.686 --> 25:59.296
People need to know!

25:59.340 --> 26:00.297
Do they?

26:01.777 --> 26:02.865
What about the day walkers?

26:02.909 --> 26:05.476
We don't know if it'll
work on them.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.957
What are you talking about?

26:08.001 --> 26:10.612
[Scoff] You guys
don't even know.

26:10.656 --> 26:13.049
There's a mutation and
it allows a vampire to walk

26:13.093 --> 26:15.791
in direct sunlight just like us
and it's spreading!

26:15.835 --> 26:16.923
That's preposterous.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.402
They're real!

26:18.446 --> 26:20.013
And they're even harder to kill.

26:20.056 --> 26:22.102
I don't have time
for these wild stories-

26:22.145 --> 26:23.059
Hey!

26:23.103 --> 26:24.452
We are telling you the truth!

26:24.495 --> 26:26.367
And if you think these walls
or your bloody shots

26:26.410 --> 26:28.848
that are gonna protect you,
you're a fucking idiot.

27:01.489 --> 27:02.708
[grunting]

27:02.751 --> 27:04.144
Honey, is that you?

27:05.624 --> 27:07.626
[Cooing]

27:26.296 --> 27:27.646
[Pedestrians] Oh, my God.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.777
Hey!

27:29.517 --> 27:30.953
Don't jump!

27:35.349 --> 27:36.698
Get down from there!

27:37.351 --> 27:38.482
Hey!

27:38.526 --> 27:40.267
Daddy!

27:48.231 --> 27:50.930
Hey, you'll be okay, okay!?

27:50.973 --> 27:52.235
You'll be fine.

27:52.279 --> 27:54.324
Just stay there.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.631
Oh, jeez, I don't know
what to do!

27:56.675 --> 27:57.937
Just hold on!

27:57.980 --> 27:59.025
Someone will come
and help you!

27:59.068 --> 28:00.940
Just take a step back,
man!

28:05.988 --> 28:07.337
Phil-

28:07.381 --> 28:08.861
Phil!

28:13.779 --> 28:16.172
Help is on its way!

28:24.790 --> 28:25.834
Don't do it!

28:28.010 --> 28:29.664
Phil?! Phil!

28:29.708 --> 28:32.667
Phil, don't!

28:32.711 --> 28:35.278
You can't do this.

28:35.322 --> 28:36.627
I have to.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.455
I found her, Phil.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.935
I found your wife.

28:39.979 --> 28:40.936
She's here.

28:40.980 --> 28:42.633
In Denver.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.287
You're lying!

28:44.331 --> 28:45.767
No!

28:45.811 --> 28:47.073
No, I'm not.

28:47.116 --> 28:49.945
I swear to God and I can
take you to her.

28:49.989 --> 28:52.513
Now just get off the ledge.

28:54.341 --> 28:57.387
She wouldn't wanna see me,
not-not after what I've done.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.172
No, you don't know that.

28:59.215 --> 29:02.566
It's too late for me.

29:02.610 --> 29:03.785
I have nothing left.

29:03.829 --> 29:04.612
Hey, hey!

29:04.655 --> 29:07.789
Phil, look at me.

29:07.833 --> 29:11.053
Look at me, Phil.

29:11.097 --> 29:14.230
It's not too late.

29:14.274 --> 29:19.322
You're a good man
with a good heart.

29:19.366 --> 29:22.804
And you need to live.

29:22.848 --> 29:26.808
Live for Lucky.

29:26.852 --> 29:30.333
Live for your kids.

29:30.377 --> 29:32.161
Live for your wife.

29:35.382 --> 29:37.993
Please, Phil.

29:38.037 --> 29:41.997
Let me take you to them.

29:42.041 --> 29:45.479
I need to take you to them.

29:50.658 --> 29:52.268
I forgive you.

29:52.312 --> 29:53.356
No!

29:56.795 --> 29:58.013
Phil!

29:59.798 --> 30:01.451
Phil!

30:07.762 --> 30:10.112
Oh, my God.

30:10.156 --> 30:17.816
[heavy breathing]

30:17.859 --> 30:20.122
[doors opening, closing]

30:33.527 --> 30:34.833
Axel.

30:36.399 --> 30:37.836
Axel.

30:39.054 --> 30:40.577
Axel.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.843
Vanessa?

30:44.886 --> 30:48.237
Don't worry, I'm here.

30:48.281 --> 30:51.588
Hide in the dark all you want,
it won't help you.

31:02.382 --> 31:05.646
Finally.

31:05.689 --> 31:08.388
The Van Helsing.

31:08.431 --> 31:14.176
I'm here for him, that ring,
and your head.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.789
Look familiar?

31:18.833 --> 31:22.271
You have a thing that does not
belong to you.

31:22.315 --> 31:26.101
You are not worthy
of an elder's totem.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.798
I will take it from your corpse

31:27.842 --> 31:31.628
and be that much closer
to releasing the dark one.

31:31.672 --> 31:36.285
Or how about I just take
your head?

31:45.468 --> 31:47.340
Kill her!

32:13.844 --> 32:15.629
[fighting grunts]

32:22.723 --> 32:27.293
[fighting grunts]

32:44.788 --> 32:47.617
[fighting grunts]

32:58.324 --> 33:01.240
[fighting grunts]

33:53.074 --> 33:56.208
The dark one will be free.

33:57.861 --> 33:59.776
Where do you think you're going,
you ugly bitch?

34:08.655 --> 34:10.048
Are you okay?

34:10.091 --> 34:12.485
Thanks to you.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.574
I've gotta get the ring.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.185
There you are.

34:20.014 --> 34:22.016
And I have something for you.

34:24.323 --> 34:26.281
Lost these?

34:26.325 --> 34:27.804
Thanks.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.241
Two down.

34:31.547 --> 34:34.507
Two to go, unfortunately.

34:34.550 --> 34:36.552
Where's Scarlett?

34:38.206 --> 34:40.556
Vanessa, where's Scarlett?

34:44.778 --> 34:45.257
Where is she?

34:45.300 --> 34:45.866
Right here!

34:45.909 --> 34:46.606
Where is she?

34:46.649 --> 34:47.563
Right here!

34:47.607 --> 34:48.651
Oh, my God!

34:48.695 --> 34:50.088
Jesus Christ.

34:53.047 --> 34:55.223
Hey, hey!

34:55.267 --> 34:56.050
Let's get her up.

34:56.094 --> 34:56.964
I feel a pulse.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.618
Ok, ok.

35:01.403 --> 35:02.187
Alright come on.

35:02.230 --> 35:03.405
[Dre] What is that?

35:03.449 --> 35:04.537
The B'ah's blood.

35:04.580 --> 35:07.540
It should counteract the poison.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.672
Hey, open up, open up, open up.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.109
Come on.

35:15.374 --> 35:16.984
Alright take it down,
take it down,

35:17.027 --> 35:19.552
you got it, you got it.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.295
That's a girl.

35:23.338 --> 35:25.427
Come on, Scarlett.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.126
You're my baddest little ninja,
come on.

35:31.955 --> 35:33.827
Come on, Scarlett.

35:33.870 --> 35:35.872
You're my baddest little ninja.

35:40.094 --> 35:44.229
[Coughing]

35:51.714 --> 35:53.716
Hey, army man.

35:55.544 --> 35:58.547
Marine.

35:58.591 --> 36:01.420
Whatever.

36:01.463 --> 36:03.291
[coughs]

36:03.335 --> 36:05.728
[exhales]

36:14.128 --> 36:15.216
You're an asshole.

36:15.260 --> 36:19.220
[coughs]

36:23.398 --> 36:25.183
Those people are unbelievable.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.706
They can't muzzle us like that.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.098
Wait, let's not start
creating panic

36:28.142 --> 36:29.230
until we think things through.

36:29.274 --> 36:30.144
People could die.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.189
Maybe they already have.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.407
And people's lives
are being saved,

36:32.451 --> 36:33.452
yours included.

36:33.495 --> 36:34.583
I don't care what they say.

36:34.627 --> 36:35.976
I'm not taking anymore
of those shots.

36:36.019 --> 36:38.021
Okay, okay, agreed.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.597
This is all that's left?

36:48.641 --> 36:52.340
Yeah, the B'Ah pretty much
wiped out the whole town.

36:52.384 --> 36:55.213
We should be safe now,
you guys made sure of that.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.084
I mean, there's probably still
some vampires around,

36:57.127 --> 36:58.390
but the queen bee
is dead.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.305
You should be able to reclaim
your city.

37:00.348 --> 37:02.263
Ah, they can't stay here,
there's no resources,

37:02.307 --> 37:04.265
there's no security.

37:04.309 --> 37:06.224
What about the military?

37:06.267 --> 37:08.356
Won't they send more troops?

37:08.400 --> 37:09.966
Make this a safe zone again?

37:10.010 --> 37:11.533
Can't bank on it.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.405
They're wiped out as well
from what I've heard.

37:13.448 --> 37:14.928
So what do we do?

37:14.971 --> 37:16.886
Denver.

37:16.930 --> 37:18.758
Supposed to be
a safe zone.

37:18.801 --> 37:21.282
We sent some of our own people
there already.

37:21.326 --> 37:22.892
It's the only option.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.590
We'll never make it on our own.

37:24.633 --> 37:26.722
Yeah, you will.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.463
'Cause I'm gonna take you there.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.378
Axel?

37:30.422 --> 37:32.598
You're not leaving.

37:34.643 --> 37:36.341
Listen to me, I have to.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.778
These people aren't gonna
make it there without me.

37:40.780 --> 37:43.696
I owe them my life,
and yours.

37:43.739 --> 37:46.133
Please, don't do this.

37:46.176 --> 37:49.092
Look, Scarlett you and Vanessa
don't need me,

37:49.136 --> 37:50.920
not for what you're doing.

37:50.964 --> 37:52.922
I need you!

37:52.966 --> 37:54.315
I do, I need you!

37:54.359 --> 37:56.274
Not like these people.

37:57.797 --> 37:59.451
Promise me somethin', alright?

38:00.887 --> 38:02.541
Promise me?

38:02.584 --> 38:04.891
What?

38:04.934 --> 38:05.935
No matter what happens,

38:05.979 --> 38:07.154
no matter how sideways
shit gets,

38:07.197 --> 38:12.507
you meet me in that place
we talked about.

38:12.551 --> 38:13.595
'Cause I'll be sittin'
there waiting

38:13.639 --> 38:16.424
to look at your face
every day.

38:18.687 --> 38:20.298
Deal?

38:22.169 --> 38:23.997
Alright.

38:28.349 --> 38:30.220
Somethin' to remember me by?

38:34.790 --> 38:36.009
Oh, wait.

38:37.837 --> 38:40.100
Something to remember me by.

38:41.406 --> 38:42.842
You're really not like
the other girls, are you?

38:42.885 --> 38:44.539
[laughs]

38:49.501 --> 38:50.719
Alright, everybody.

38:50.763 --> 38:53.069
Listen up, we leave
at dawn.

38:53.113 --> 38:54.506
I want you to go out
in scavenging groups

38:54.549 --> 38:56.029
no less than three.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.378
Gather whatever supplies
you might need-

38:57.422 --> 39:00.207
food, water, weapons, whatever.

39:00.250 --> 39:01.991
Watch your backs out there.

39:02.035 --> 39:04.080
The city's still infested.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.520
You heard the man, get movin'!

39:12.480 --> 39:13.568
Thank you.

39:13.612 --> 39:14.439
Yeah, thank you.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.223
Thank you, guys.

39:19.922 --> 39:21.228
Thank you.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.323
So is this it?

39:29.367 --> 39:31.499
You sure?

39:31.543 --> 39:32.718
It looks like it.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.939
Well, you said it,
sleeping beauty.

39:36.983 --> 39:39.464
I've been lookin' after you
long enough.

39:40.508 --> 39:43.119
Alright, I'll miss you.

39:45.295 --> 39:48.386
Take care of yourself. Be safe.

39:50.605 --> 39:54.566
Bring her back
in one piece.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.742
Yeah, not a scratch.

40:18.154 --> 40:19.155
Ah, come on.

40:19.199 --> 40:20.853
Hold on a second.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.596
Come over here.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.260
Big finale, huh?

40:37.304 --> 40:38.523
Kinda had to.

40:38.566 --> 40:40.089
I'm glad you did.

40:45.704 --> 40:46.835
[exhales]

40:46.879 --> 40:48.620
See you.

40:53.276 --> 40:54.495
I promise you'll see him again.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.279
I'm gonna hold you to that.

41:15.864 --> 41:18.476
Goodness, girl.

41:18.519 --> 41:21.348
You're huge.

41:22.741 --> 41:26.875
The old love of my life's name
was Wanda.

41:26.919 --> 41:30.662
She looked more like
a Ronda.

41:30.705 --> 41:33.534
Let's see if you've still got
your singin' voice.

41:50.029 --> 41:52.814
You didn't destroy the totems,
did you?

41:52.858 --> 41:54.512
I got a plan, so
you gotta trust me-

41:54.555 --> 41:56.601
No, you gotta trust me.

41:56.644 --> 41:58.254
I'm also risking
my life for humanity,

41:58.298 --> 42:00.343
so tell me the plan.

42:00.387 --> 42:01.562
Okay, but you're
not gonna like it.

42:01.606 --> 42:04.217
Try me.

42:04.260 --> 42:07.133
We kill the elders,
take their totems,

42:07.176 --> 42:10.223
and resurrect the dark one
ourselves.

42:10.266 --> 42:12.965
We end this once and for all.

42:15.010 --> 42:17.491
Okay, you're right.
I don't love it.

42:17.535 --> 42:21.103
In fact, I don't even like it.

42:21.147 --> 42:23.062
But I'll do it.
