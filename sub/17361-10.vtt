WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:07.417
(birds squawking in distance)

00:16.266 --> 00:19.258
(music playing)

00:47.505 --> 00:51.168
(insects chirping)

00:54.012 --> 00:56.128
Thanks for keeping watch
last night.

00:56.306 --> 01:00.140
Oh, it's nothing.
I like it.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.800
(chuckles)

01:01.978 --> 01:04.890
Uh, you can keep watch
tonight.

01:05.065 --> 01:09.183
(breathes deeply)

01:09.360 --> 01:11.225
We gonna win today?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.814
Oh, yeah.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.822
We're gonna need batteries
for that walkie, too.

01:15.992 --> 01:19.655
Get it working again.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.619
(music playing)

01:53.363 --> 01:57.072
What is it?
What's that smile?

01:57.242 --> 02:00.700
Couple of days out,
all we got to show are

02:00.870 --> 02:02.531
two guns,
dented cans of beans,

02:02.705 --> 02:04.696
and some football jerseys,
pretty much.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.956
Pretty much.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.960
We're fightin' the fight.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.416
It's better.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.376
(golf club swishes, grass rustles)

02:22.267 --> 02:23.632
(man speaking indistinctly)

02:23.810 --> 02:26.893
And ifl hear one more
goddamn word about Fat Joey,

02:27.063 --> 02:28.724
I'm gonna smash
somebody's teeth in.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.729
Good riddance
to dead weight.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.185
No more mascot crap.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.103
(golf club swishes,
golf ball clacks)

02:40.994 --> 02:42.655
Michonne:
They got good taste in pretzels.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.410
Rick: And batteries.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.822
(walkie-talkie clicks, beeps,
static crackling)

02:47.000 --> 02:48.410
(walking-talkie clicks,
crackling stops)

02:48.585 --> 02:52.077
Two days. (sighs)
We're gonna need to get back.

02:55.758 --> 02:58.090
Rick...

02:58.261 --> 03:01.674
Day and a half more--
today and tomorrow.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.009
We can come out again.
We should get back.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.303
Just a little more.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.607
We're okay.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.436
We don't have to find them
right now.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.602
Yeah, I know.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.236
Just a little more, okay?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.949
Okay.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.283
Okay.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.200
(both chuckle)

03:41.471 --> 03:45.134
(music playing)

04:29.519 --> 04:31.510
Hey, I was just coming over
to do that.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.100
Denise showed me how.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.557
I'm done.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.686
What?

04:40.863 --> 04:43.070
Nothing.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.278
Okay.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.034
It's gonna work out.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.287
What-- what does
that even mean, Tara?

04:51.457 --> 04:53.038
It means we've got
the numbers to fight now.

04:53.209 --> 04:54.619
We just need to find
some guns and--

04:54.794 --> 04:57.376
Do you know where we could find
that many guns today?

04:57.547 --> 05:01.381
This week?
This year?

05:01.551 --> 05:04.964
No.
You don't.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.722
I can't just wait.

05:08.891 --> 05:12.133
I don't know about you,
but I can't.

05:12.312 --> 05:16.225
We're gonna find the guns, okay?
And we're gonna fight.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.730
Look, it's
not gonna be easy.

05:17.900 --> 05:21.313
It wasn't the last time
at the outpost.

05:23.072 --> 05:26.109
Hey, maybe you could
just save all this for them.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.118
(scoffs)

05:31.289 --> 05:33.075
Here.

05:33.249 --> 05:36.912
It'll help
with your scar.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.334
Keep it.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.839
We need guns.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.750
I'm gonna go find them.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.535
(branch cracks)

06:32.475 --> 06:34.136
(gasps, panting)

06:34.310 --> 06:36.221
Shh.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.182
Shh.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.746
Damn it.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.498
What was it?

06:59.669 --> 07:00.658
It was a deer.

07:00.837 --> 07:05.422
(sighs)
I owe you a deer.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.047
From before.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.879
When they were
outside the gate.

07:09.053 --> 07:11.510
Oh, yeah, you do.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.689
You see that?

07:26.529 --> 07:29.612
Yeah.

07:35.413 --> 07:39.076
(fence post clangs)

07:41.252 --> 07:44.915
(walker growling)

07:50.094 --> 07:53.757
(walker growling)

07:57.268 --> 08:00.351
Rick: It's guns like that.
That's why we're out here.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.444
(sniffs)

08:11.449 --> 08:15.112
(birds chirping in distance)

08:24.587 --> 08:28.079
(shell casings clink)

08:28.257 --> 08:32.250
Something serious
happened here.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.009
A long time ago.

08:34.180 --> 08:37.593
Yeah.
These are serious rounds.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.759
Might be
serious guns here, too.

08:40.937 --> 08:44.270
(walkers growling in distance)

08:48.444 --> 08:50.150
Let's get
a better look.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.107
Yeah.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.700
(insects buzzing,
birds chirping)

09:24.522 --> 09:28.185
(walker growling)

09:59.682 --> 10:02.344
(toy gun clatters)

10:02.518 --> 10:04.258
Damn it.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.269
(grunts)

10:07.440 --> 10:09.772
(walkers growling in distance)

10:09.942 --> 10:12.058
Watch your step.

10:12.236 --> 10:15.444
Maybe we shouldn't be
up here too long.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.199
Well, let's see
what we're gonna see.

10:19.368 --> 10:23.031
(growling continues)

10:35.551 --> 10:39.715
Rick: Soldiers, civilians,
all those rounds--

10:39.889 --> 10:41.425
There was a fight.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.885
Maybe it was the walkers.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.051
Maybe just other people.

10:46.228 --> 10:50.062
They're still wearing
their guns.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.974
I think this is it.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.315
I think it is, too.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.275
Think we can?

11:15.257 --> 11:16.633
(gunshot)

11:16.801 --> 11:20.259
(rifle cocks, shell clatters)

11:21.263 --> 11:22.673
(gunshot)

11:22.848 --> 11:24.179
(bottles clatter)

11:24.350 --> 11:28.013
(both laugh)

11:30.439 --> 11:32.179
Yeah, we can.

11:35.444 --> 11:39.107
(roof cracking, crashing)

11:45.371 --> 11:48.579
(both laugh)

11:52.461 --> 11:54.998
(water splashing)

11:56.173 --> 11:58.585
(both laughing)

12:03.556 --> 12:04.796
(chucang)
Are you okay?

12:04.974 --> 12:06.510
Y-yeah. Are you?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.640
I am.
(clears throat)

12:08.811 --> 12:11.974
(sighs) This is--
this is a sign, right?

12:12.148 --> 12:14.639
(both laugh)

12:14.817 --> 12:16.307
This is it.
It has to be.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.396
(grunts)

12:18.571 --> 12:22.189
Oh-ho. It is.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.526
(gasps)

12:26.704 --> 12:28.490
Well, they're ready.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.404
Let's eat.

12:30.583 --> 12:35.247
(both laugh)

12:35.421 --> 12:40.336
(walkers growling)

12:47.349 --> 12:49.135
(door opens)

13:00.529 --> 13:03.362
I didn't find any guns.

13:03.532 --> 13:05.272
Rosita:
In case you were wondering.

13:05.451 --> 13:09.194
l was out there all day
and not a damn one.

13:09.371 --> 13:13.364
Not a real one.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.875
Thing is, I had a gun.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.456
l was gonna use it
to kill Negan.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.462
l was ready to.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.045
And ifl had done it,
like I'd planned to,

13:23.219 --> 13:25.255
Negan would be dead
right now.

13:25.429 --> 13:30.219
And, yeah, maybe I'd be dead,
too, but who gives a damn?

13:30.392 --> 13:33.600
Eugene would
still be here.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.729
Olivia would
still be alive.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.561
Spencer would
still be alive.

13:39.735 --> 13:42.898
And now they're gone,
and I'm here

13:43.072 --> 13:47.065
because I was stupid enough
to listen to you.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.450
But you were.

13:50.746 --> 13:53.158
And you did.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.752
You stand there telling people
about their lives.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.710
Only if they come here.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.794
Like you.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.508
Right now.

14:09.682 --> 14:13.516
You don't know shit
about shit.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.098
You're right.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.012
I don't.

14:19.859 --> 14:24.398
I said that you weren't
supposed to die

14:24.572 --> 14:25.561
and that you shouldn't do
the thing

14:25.739 --> 14:28.355
that you were planning
to do

14:28.534 --> 14:30.616
because we needed you--

14:30.786 --> 14:33.277
still do.

14:33.455 --> 14:36.117
Even a fool like me
could see that.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.203
It's easier to be dead,

14:38.377 --> 14:39.878
and if it's my fault
you're alive,

14:40.045 --> 14:41.660
well, I'm just gonna have
to live with that.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.706
I decided to meddle.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.500
But I did something
I thought was right,

14:47.678 --> 14:51.671
and I knew the stakes
were very high.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.216
You can certainly blame me
for the fact that you have a life,

14:55.394 --> 14:58.352
but after that what
are you going to do with it?

14:58.522 --> 15:03.642
How are you going to make
what needs to happen happen?

15:03.819 --> 15:08.153
Anything is possible
until your heart stops beating.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.407
Certainly more than yelling
at a fool.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.026
(gasps)

15:48.197 --> 15:50.529
What?

15:50.699 --> 15:53.111
Mmm.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.916
How is it?

16:00.084 --> 16:02.746
(mouth full) It's good.
(chuckles)

16:06.966 --> 16:09.082
- So, tomorrow...
- Mm-hmm.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.717
...we go out there,
we get the weapons, right?

16:12.888 --> 16:16.597
We get Jadis and her people
to fight with us.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.725
We kill Negan and anyone else
we have to to win.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.305
(sighs)

16:21.480 --> 16:25.393
And what happens
after that?

16:25.567 --> 16:28.058
After that,
we keep going.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.728
Yeah, but...

16:30.906 --> 16:33.739
Negan ordered the world
his way.

16:33.909 --> 16:37.322
It's up to us to reorder it
once he's gone, right?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.578
(breathes deeply)

16:39.748 --> 16:42.581
All the different
communities,

16:42.751 --> 16:45.743
they can figure it out together,
how to keep going together.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.913
Yeah, but somebody's gonna have
to make that happen.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.503
Somebody will need to be
in charge of that, right?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.918
(sighs)
Mm.

16:54.096 --> 16:58.931
- It should be you.
- (sighs, chuckles)

16:59.101 --> 17:02.343
- Not me.
- Why not?

17:02.521 --> 17:03.761
You could do it.

17:03.939 --> 17:06.772
- (sighs)
- You'd be good at it.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.274
I mean, if it's something
that you wanted.

17:09.445 --> 17:12.903
Well, I don't think I do.
Or I would.

17:16.618 --> 17:21.863
But the two of us,
you and me,

17:22.041 --> 17:25.829
reordering things
together...

17:26.003 --> 17:29.791
(sighs)
...I want that.

17:29.965 --> 17:33.708
If it's something
you wanted.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.303
Yeah.

17:53.530 --> 17:57.648
(breathes deeply)

17:57.826 --> 17:59.657
I'm gonna eat five more
of these dinners, okay?

17:59.828 --> 18:01.864
(chuckles)

18:02.039 --> 18:04.872
You know...

18:05.042 --> 18:08.330
we don't have
to get it done tomorrow.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.337
We can take our time.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.997
If we go another day,
another one after that,

18:13.175 --> 18:14.915
it's fine.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.552
I mean,
the place is clear.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.054
It's locked up tight.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.431
(sighs)

18:22.601 --> 18:25.843
We found
the only way in, so...

18:27.856 --> 18:31.019
We should get back.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.900
If we're getting the guns,

18:34.071 --> 18:36.278
it doesn't matter
if it takes a little longer.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.689
Wait.
I've been, um...

18:38.867 --> 18:41.904
I've been waiting
to show you this one.

18:42.079 --> 18:47.244
It's, um, chili
and mac and cheese...

18:49.086 --> 18:50.792
together.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.169
Come on.

18:57.886 --> 19:01.378
(walkers growling)

19:05.060 --> 19:08.723
(insects chirping in distance)

19:54.109 --> 19:55.690
Oh. Sorry.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.601
(breathes deeply)

19:57.779 --> 20:00.361
lwasjust thinking.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.988
Wh-- you--
you want this?

20:06.163 --> 20:09.030
(sighs)
Congrats.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.448
It's yours.

20:10.626 --> 20:14.369
Someone gave it to me,
someone who helped me.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.788
She put her ass
on the line for me.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.297
She saved my life,
you know?

20:19.468 --> 20:22.301
She didn't have to.
But she did.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.802
That means something now--
it does.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.258
It has to.

20:28.310 --> 20:31.802
If I say something,
you know--

20:31.980 --> 20:33.811
Rick won't leave there
without their guns.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.392
If-- if we could
even get close enough,

20:35.567 --> 20:39.856
they'll start firing,
and we'll fire back.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.737
I mean, they should
just fight with us.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.822
The Saviors killed
their fathers

20:47.996 --> 20:50.328
and their sons
and their brothers.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.828
They won't want
to fight with us.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.412
They just want to hide.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.873
(breathes deeply)

20:58.048 --> 21:00.255
So they'll just fight us.

21:03.845 --> 21:07.804
I tell everyone about Oceanside,
that's what happens.

21:13.897 --> 21:16.855
What makes our life worth more
than theirs?

21:21.029 --> 21:22.018
Because we want to stop

21:22.197 --> 21:25.530
the people
that are hurting us,

21:25.701 --> 21:28.408
who will hurt
other people?

21:39.298 --> 21:41.084
God damn it.

21:42.217 --> 21:45.880
(walkers growling)

22:15.584 --> 22:16.915
Michonne: Look.

22:17.085 --> 22:20.077
The walkers in the field,
they're not closed in.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.620
Uh-huh.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.129
Rick: Yeah.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.507
We got to take care
of the ones out here

22:25.677 --> 22:28.510
and block that gap, too,
so we can take the rest slow.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.511
Seven, eight...

22:35.103 --> 22:37.765
nine...

22:37.939 --> 22:41.022
That car--
I can block it up.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.603
I can take out
that one on the way.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.520
You draw the rest.

22:45.697 --> 22:47.437
You're leaving me eight.

22:50.285 --> 22:51.786
We could shoot them,

22:51.953 --> 22:53.284
but that would call the rest
from the field.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.413
This is about doing it quiet,
with the sword.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.495
You can handle eight.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.667
Hey.

23:10.305 --> 23:12.671
(dumpster bangs)

23:12.849 --> 23:16.558
(walkers growling)

23:22.401 --> 23:26.064
(grunts)

23:31.493 --> 23:35.156
(walker growling)

23:37.499 --> 23:38.659
Hyah!

23:38.834 --> 23:39.994
Hyah!

23:54.349 --> 23:56.681
(grunting)

23:56.852 --> 23:59.093
(walker growling)

23:59.271 --> 24:01.683
(grunting)

24:08.363 --> 24:11.275
(growling continues)

24:20.876 --> 24:22.537
(walker growling)

24:22.711 --> 24:23.917
(grunting)

24:39.436 --> 24:42.303
You got your eight walkers.
I can push.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.812
So can I.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.314
You just worry
about steering us in that gap.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.565
- (brakes squeak)
- Shit.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.105
The brakes don't work.

24:54.618 --> 24:59.328
(gunfire)

24:59.498 --> 25:03.161
(walker growling)

25:04.920 --> 25:08.458
(gunfire continues)

25:08.632 --> 25:11.044
(gunfire stops)

25:18.183 --> 25:21.016
Michonne, you good?

25:21.186 --> 25:22.596
Michonne: Yeah.

25:22.771 --> 25:23.977
You?

25:24.147 --> 25:25.262
(sighs)

25:25.440 --> 25:27.271
Yeah.

25:27.442 --> 25:30.434
I think we overshot it.

25:30.612 --> 25:33.604
You think or you know?

25:36.117 --> 25:37.277
I know.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.695
It was a good plan,
though.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.784
It was a great plan.

25:43.959 --> 25:47.952
(growling continues)

25:51.299 --> 25:54.962
(walkers growling)

26:15.156 --> 26:17.021
We'll do it here.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.986
Yeah.

26:22.872 --> 26:24.828
Shit.
It's not gonna hold.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.586
- There it goes!
- (fence clangs)

26:31.756 --> 26:35.419
(growling continues)

26:58.033 --> 26:59.819
(bell dings)

27:07.542 --> 27:11.205
(growling continues)

27:12.380 --> 27:14.291
Split them off
into smaller groups.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.206
The barriers might hold.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.215
You take slide,
I take Ferris wheel?

27:18.386 --> 27:20.638
Or we could just go.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.545
- You want to go?
- Nah. We can do this.

27:22.724 --> 27:23.804
Yeah, I know we can.

27:23.975 --> 27:27.638
(growling continues)

27:46.498 --> 27:48.910
(fence clanging)

27:52.837 --> 27:56.500
(clanging continues)

28:12.649 --> 28:16.312
(both grunting)

28:23.326 --> 28:24.657
How you doing?!

28:24.828 --> 28:26.944
Eight more!

28:27.122 --> 28:28.862
How about you?

28:32.127 --> 28:33.333
10!

28:33.503 --> 28:35.915
(walkers growling)

28:53.481 --> 28:55.221
Hyah!
(grunts)

29:27.015 --> 29:29.722
(metal creaks)

29:31.853 --> 29:33.593
Rick!

29:34.939 --> 29:37.021
(grunts)

29:37.192 --> 29:40.855
(walkers growling)

29:44.699 --> 29:47.156
(gunshots)

29:49.078 --> 29:51.535
(gunshot)

29:51.706 --> 29:52.946
Rick!

29:55.752 --> 29:57.538
(gunshots)

29:57.712 --> 30:00.203
(pistol clicks)

30:00.381 --> 30:04.044
(growling continues)

30:07.222 --> 30:11.090
(flesh rending)

30:53.101 --> 30:55.717
(grunts)

31:00.775 --> 31:01.935
Michonne!

31:07.282 --> 31:10.945
(both grunting)

31:18.209 --> 31:19.369
Unh!

31:25.550 --> 31:27.290
(crying)

31:27.468 --> 31:31.461
I tried,
but I still owe you one.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.569
(brakes squeal)

33:19.747 --> 33:22.159
(engine idling)

33:23.418 --> 33:26.160
(engine stops)

33:26.337 --> 33:28.123
(sighs)

33:31.259 --> 33:34.251
I could've gone
a couple more days.

33:34.429 --> 33:37.136
I would've liked that.

33:37.306 --> 33:40.969
(birds chirping in distance)

33:46.941 --> 33:49.057
I haven't been sleeping.

33:53.656 --> 33:55.817
Thinking
about what we lost.

33:59.454 --> 34:03.117
Thinking
about my friends.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.203
Glenn saved me.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.333
Right at the start.

34:08.504 --> 34:11.587
I couldn't save him.

34:12.633 --> 34:14.715
It's normal.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.298
I know that.
(sighs)

34:17.472 --> 34:21.806
Being stuck on it.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.477
We went
through something.

34:23.644 --> 34:26.477
This-- this doesn't cure it.

34:26.647 --> 34:28.683
Rick, I'm sorry.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.687
(breathes deeply)

34:35.865 --> 34:39.733
We're gonna fight them.

34:39.911 --> 34:44.200
That's what happens next.

34:44.373 --> 34:46.364
And we're gonna
lose people,

34:46.542 --> 34:48.794
maybe a lot of them,
maybe even each other.

34:53.674 --> 34:57.508
Even then,
it'll be worth it.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.588
When I thought that...

35:07.355 --> 35:11.018
I can't lose you.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.399
You asked me

35:13.569 --> 35:19.109
what kind of life we had
just surrendering.

35:19.283 --> 35:23.777
It wasn't--
it wasn't a life.

35:23.955 --> 35:27.038
What we did back there,

35:27.208 --> 35:29.915
what we're doing now,

35:30.086 --> 35:32.372
making a future for Judith

35:32.547 --> 35:34.037
and for Glenn
and Maggie's baby,

35:34.215 --> 35:37.378
fighting the fight,
that's living.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.419
You showed me that.

35:40.596 --> 35:42.632
You can lose me.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.593
- No.
- Yes, you can.

35:44.767 --> 35:47.884
- I can lose you.
- (sniffles)

35:48.062 --> 35:52.977
We can lose our friends,
people we love.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.608
It's not about us
anymore.

35:55.778 --> 35:57.689
It's about a future.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.739
And if it's me
who doesn't make it,

36:01.909 --> 36:03.740
you're gonna have
to lead the others forward

36:03.911 --> 36:06.323
because you're the one who can.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.409
But...

36:12.587 --> 36:15.329
how do you know?

36:15.506 --> 36:18.088
Because".

36:18.259 --> 36:21.797
you led me here.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.603
Operational? All?

36:32.773 --> 36:34.604
To the best
of my knowledge, yeah.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.185
(pistol clicks)

36:36.360 --> 36:40.103
Rick: May need some cleaning.
We found supplies.

36:40.281 --> 36:42.021
Expect us?

36:42.200 --> 36:44.282
We cleaned some.
We oiled some.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.443
You can do the rest.
We do this together.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.782
Yes, yes, but operational?

36:48.956 --> 36:51.447
Well, you can fire a few.
Try them out, if you like.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.787
- How many?
- Michonne: 63.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.292
We made an inventory.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.624
No.

36:57.798 --> 36:59.754
You mean the inventory?

37:01.135 --> 37:02.591
- Not enough.
- Tara: What?

37:02.762 --> 37:03.797
Wha-- what are you talking about?

37:03.971 --> 37:05.677
You asked for a lot of guns.
That's what this is.

37:05.848 --> 37:08.965
Enough to fight your fight.
Us? Nearly twice.

37:09.143 --> 37:10.508
Need nearly twice.

37:10.686 --> 37:11.801
We've wasted enough time.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.139
Let's go.
Take our guns with us.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.645
Jadis: No.

37:14.815 --> 37:18.353
Our guns to take.
Our deal still on.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.858
Not all of them.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.740
We're keeping 10
for ourselves, to find more.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.026
Five.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.410
- 10.
- Six.

37:29.580 --> 37:31.161
- 10.
- Nine.

37:31.332 --> 37:33.072
And the cat back.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.665
20.
I keep the cat.

37:38.839 --> 37:41.831
We get you the guns.
We fight together.

37:42.009 --> 37:44.671
Say yes.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.672
Yes.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.841
More soon, we'll fight.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.414
Michonne:
You get a few more days

38:19.588 --> 38:22.830
before "what happens next."

38:26.637 --> 38:27.877
Few more days?

38:28.055 --> 38:29.886
That's right.

38:30.057 --> 38:32.924
We'll find more,
figure it out.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.388
Soon.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.145
In a few more days.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.663
Hey.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.081
Tara: Hey.

39:05.259 --> 39:07.124
You all right?

39:07.303 --> 39:10.340
Yeah, yeah, lwas just--
I was just coming over to see you.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.015
What's up?

39:12.183 --> 39:13.764
Have you seen Rosita?

39:13.934 --> 39:16.641
She didn't show for her
guard shift this morning.

39:16.812 --> 39:21.351
She probably just went out
looking for more.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.937
Mm. Yeah.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.692
(breathes deeply)

39:25.863 --> 39:27.649
Why were you--

39:27.823 --> 39:29.859
why were you coming by?

39:33.788 --> 39:37.201
l have something
to tell you.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.601
Hi.

40:09.573 --> 40:10.983
Are you here--

40:11.158 --> 40:13.365
I'm here
because I need your help.

40:23.087 --> 40:24.998
One condition--

40:27.091 --> 40:30.549
I get to take the shot.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.424
Okay.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.601
Did you bring any explosives
from the bridge?

40:40.771 --> 40:42.352
I thought about it.

40:42.523 --> 40:44.764
But I didn't want anyone finding out
and trying to stop me.

40:44.942 --> 40:47.183
I got something better,
though.

41:01.876 --> 41:03.958
So you can take
yourshot

41:07.465 --> 41:09.251
(sighs)

41:12.803 --> 41:15.044
Rick and Michonne
found guns.

41:19.393 --> 41:20.803
But they aren't ready
to move.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.434
They can't.

41:22.605 --> 41:25.267
They need more guns,
more people, more time,

41:25.441 --> 41:28.649
more excuses.

41:28.819 --> 41:31.652
I memorized everything
Daryl and Carl told Rick

41:31.822 --> 41:33.938
about the inside
of Negan's place.

41:34.116 --> 41:37.904
Jesus made me a map
of the outside.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.069
It's far away.
It's well-defended.

41:40.247 --> 41:42.408
- There's only two of us.
- You changing your mind?

41:42.583 --> 41:44.574
I'm ready to kill him.

41:44.752 --> 41:47.084
But I need to make sure
you know what this means.

41:47.254 --> 41:48.334
Do you?

41:48.506 --> 41:50.747
(scoffs)

41:50.925 --> 41:55.009
They can't catch us alive.

41:55.179 --> 41:57.261
If they do,
we give them something.

41:57.431 --> 42:00.423
It's a one-way ticket
for both of us.

42:03.270 --> 42:06.478
If it is both of us.

42:06.649 --> 42:08.640
It is.

42:13.405 --> 42:17.899
