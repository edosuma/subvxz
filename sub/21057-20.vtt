00:36.909 --> 00:41.850
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:46.579 --> 00:48.649
Who do you think it is? The killer.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.659
I'm not sure.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.530
Everyone in Gangnam is talking about her death.

00:55.030 --> 00:57.960
A Jin impresses me so much.

00:58.659 --> 01:00.170
She sure is impressive.

01:00.570 --> 01:02.929
She said she won't sue for alimony or division of property.

01:03.369 --> 01:05.468
I think she'll just end it with that house alone.

01:05.870 --> 01:08.370
She said she deserves the house for all the efforts that she has made.

01:10.409 --> 01:12.439
So many crazy things have happened around her, you know.

01:12.709 --> 01:14.609
But somehow, she managed to keep it together.

01:14.709 --> 01:16.510
She's mentally healthy.

01:17.420 --> 01:21.150
Gosh, I hope Su Min grows like her. I don't want her to take after me.

01:24.120 --> 01:25.120
Divorce...

01:26.219 --> 01:28.290
It may be the last stage of marriage.

01:29.629 --> 01:32.329
Doesn't every married couple think about getting divorced once?

01:33.969 --> 01:35.170
That's true.

01:37.099 --> 01:38.140
By the way,

01:39.099 --> 01:42.010
I heard that Gyeong Hui has been getting severe morning sickness.

01:47.010 --> 01:48.810
Yun Jae is leaving soon to go to school abroad.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.079
They're sending him to the boarding school Do Hyeon is attending.

01:58.689 --> 02:00.829
You said that you broke up with that boyfriend of yours.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.129
You must be bored these days.

02:04.459 --> 02:07.769
Rich women who are passionate and have a ton of time on their hands...

02:07.769 --> 02:09.068
are the most unfortunate ones.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.038
I'm one of them.

02:13.139 --> 02:14.539
You're so spoiled.

02:17.639 --> 02:19.080
I miss A Jin.

02:20.009 --> 02:21.009
She must be very busy these days.

02:21.509 --> 02:24.150
Seoul High Court is now in session for an oral argument hearing...

02:24.250 --> 02:27.550
appealing the divorce case, 2017R- 21315.

02:28.689 --> 02:30.960
The respondent isn't here though.

02:32.060 --> 02:36.189
Appellant, you wrote "No reason" as the reason for your appeal...

02:36.330 --> 02:37.659
in the form you submitted.

02:38.159 --> 02:40.930
Appellant, is there anything specific you'd like to tell us?

02:43.599 --> 02:44.639
Your Honor,

02:45.669 --> 02:47.710
I cannot accept this divorce.

02:48.009 --> 02:50.610
I will protect my wife and my family,

02:50.710 --> 02:53.039
even if this country... I mean, even if this world falls apart.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.150
Since the respondent isn't here today,

02:55.680 --> 02:57.620
we'll have to reschedule this trial.

02:58.319 --> 03:00.319
What did I do so wrong?

03:00.449 --> 03:01.990
Please at least answer my question.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.689
Did you break it off with that woman?

03:04.159 --> 03:05.159
Which woman?

03:05.659 --> 03:06.659
Goodness.

03:08.830 --> 03:11.330
Wait, Your Honor. Your Honor!

03:16.229 --> 03:18.900
We received NFS' official autopsy report.

03:19.139 --> 03:22.810
The time of death is presumed to be between 2am and 4am on February 28.

03:23.310 --> 03:26.580
She had wine with cheese about an hour before she died...

03:26.710 --> 03:29.009
and a significant amount of barium, which is commonly used...

03:29.250 --> 03:32.449
for psychiatric medication, was found in her stomach.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.550
That must mean she had been seeing a psychiatrist.

03:34.789 --> 03:36.860
Correct. We did some digging and found out...

03:36.860 --> 03:39.819
that she was seeing a psychiatrist for about a month.

03:40.659 --> 03:43.400
Also, she couldn't fall asleep without sleeping pills.

03:44.259 --> 03:46.229
We've tracked down Gu Bong Cheol's whereabouts.

03:57.979 --> 03:58.979
Hello?

03:58.979 --> 03:59.979
It's me.

04:00.509 --> 04:02.080
I'm going to the police station now.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.379
You remember what I told you, right?

04:04.080 --> 04:05.879
Dump everything on Park Bok Ja.

04:07.090 --> 04:10.120
That woman, Park Bok Ja. Park Bok Ja!

04:10.560 --> 04:12.060
She's already dead.

04:17.100 --> 04:19.800
Mr. Gu. Hey, Gu Bong Cheol!

04:25.300 --> 04:28.939
(Seoul Gangnam police station)

04:28.939 --> 04:29.970
Why did you run away?

04:31.379 --> 04:32.610
I never ran away.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.279
We issued a number of appearance notices.

04:35.610 --> 04:38.050
We were only able to catch you after circulating wanted posters.

04:38.220 --> 04:39.480
I didn't kill her.

04:39.850 --> 04:41.420
It's our job to find out whether you did it or not.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.060
I heard from Ms. Woo A Jin...

04:46.160 --> 04:48.290
that Park Ji Yeong could move into Chairman Ahn's residence...

04:48.730 --> 04:49.730
because of you.

04:50.029 --> 04:51.230
You colluded with her...

04:51.930 --> 04:54.699
and you were instrumental in helping her marry Chairman Ahn.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.709
Did you feel deeply betrayed by her?

05:03.540 --> 05:04.540
Yes.

05:05.980 --> 05:07.250
I did feel betrayed at the beginning.

05:09.980 --> 05:11.180
I resented her.

05:13.050 --> 05:14.550
But I came to understand her at some point.

05:15.889 --> 05:18.060
Suddenly becoming a member of high society can change you, you know.

05:19.389 --> 05:21.189
I just told myself that such a change was inevitable.

05:22.860 --> 05:26.029
Do you have an alibi for the day that she died?

05:27.769 --> 05:29.829
The elder son's wife ordered me to kill her.

05:30.639 --> 05:32.699
That's when I knew that Bok Ja would get killed soon...

05:33.670 --> 05:34.910
if the situation didn't change.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.839
I hated her too, but I could not bring myself to kill her.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.720
Where have you been? And what have you been doing all this time?

05:46.689 --> 05:50.019
I helped my friend out at his fitness center in Daejeon.

05:50.089 --> 05:52.759
How did you hear about Park Ji Yeong's death?

05:54.029 --> 05:55.129
I saw it on the news.

05:59.060 --> 06:00.129
Do you have evidence...

06:01.129 --> 06:03.170
to prove that Ms. Park Ju Mi ordered you to kill her?

06:04.639 --> 06:05.639
No, I don't.

06:07.610 --> 06:09.240
She'd never leave any evidence behind.

06:10.779 --> 06:12.980
She'll manage to evade the police net no matter how hard you try.

06:15.279 --> 06:16.579
She's extremely clever.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.350
We didn't need the security company's service anymore.

06:20.790 --> 06:22.750
That's the only reason why I canceled our contract with them.

06:23.220 --> 06:26.730
As you know, people were gossiping about our family like crazy.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.560
"A caregiver seduced the chairman and ran with a huge chunk of money."

06:32.199 --> 06:34.370
I couldn't stand the fact that they were watching us...

06:34.569 --> 06:36.740
and I also hated that we were monitoring them.

06:37.639 --> 06:40.110
I hate security cameras.

06:40.410 --> 06:41.939
I heard that you were...

06:42.839 --> 06:45.639
with your husband at Leo Resort on February 28.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.350
Is it true?

06:48.350 --> 06:50.550
- Yes. - Do you have an alibi?

06:51.750 --> 06:54.589
I guess my husband and I will have to be each other's witness.

06:56.319 --> 06:57.519
You've solicited Gu Bong Cheol...

06:58.490 --> 07:00.629
to kill Park Ji Yeong, haven't you?

07:05.829 --> 07:06.870
Detective.

07:07.730 --> 07:09.230
I'm a professor.

07:10.139 --> 07:13.970
Well, I do admit that I hated her that I even wanted to kill her.

07:14.310 --> 07:17.639
However, I know better than to risk losing everything I have...

07:18.040 --> 07:21.079
just to kill a woman like her.

07:22.250 --> 07:26.449
We checked dashboard camera footage from a car that was parked nearby.

07:27.250 --> 07:30.060
A man walking into the house was caught on the camera from behind.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.689
There were actually two men.

07:51.910 --> 07:54.449
Well, they were holding umbrellas as it was raining,

07:54.980 --> 07:57.149
so we haven't been able to confirm their identities,

07:58.279 --> 07:59.350
but it's possible...

08:01.389 --> 08:03.519
that Gu Bong Cheol was one of them.

08:05.389 --> 08:08.689
Tell us. Have you really been bugging all of our conversations?

08:09.290 --> 08:11.759
No, of course not. It's just a misunderstanding.

08:11.759 --> 08:15.399
The rumor has spread all over Gangnam.

08:15.399 --> 08:17.800
We heard that Park Bok Ja tipped off a reporter.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.240
Before she died, she said that the reporter will expose...

08:20.310 --> 08:22.269
all of your dirty deeds.

08:23.139 --> 08:24.910
He's waiting for the right time to drop the bomb.

08:25.009 --> 08:26.850
Gosh, that is absolutely crazy.

08:27.610 --> 08:29.649
By the way, where did you hear about all this?

08:29.709 --> 08:31.519
Have you heard of Gangnam Paparazzi?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.389
It's a tabloid that covers all kinds of rumors about people in Gangnam...

08:34.450 --> 08:35.519
and they covered the rumor.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.720
Anyway, it's not true.

08:37.759 --> 08:40.129
Why would I plant a bug here? That is just crazy.

08:40.129 --> 08:42.360
If that's the case, can we search the place?

08:44.929 --> 08:46.629
Of course. Search all you want.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.269
Enough!

08:54.440 --> 08:57.179
We didn't even talk about anything important.

08:57.409 --> 08:59.080
Why would she bug our conversations?

08:59.580 --> 09:01.809
Right, they were all just chitchats.

09:07.690 --> 09:10.559
She's definitely hiding something.

09:10.990 --> 09:14.190
I've been suspicious of her for some time now.

09:14.629 --> 09:16.759
She knows everything...

09:16.830 --> 09:19.500
that we've talked about.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.330
Ladies, come out for a second.

09:28.110 --> 09:29.740
She's the Pungsan family's new housekeeper.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.549
Did they hire her as Yeo Ul's replacement after firing her?

09:33.679 --> 09:36.110
No, I'm just a helper.

09:36.379 --> 09:38.220
I don't clean or cook.

09:38.279 --> 09:41.649
I run Chairman Ahn's errands and assist him with his meals.

09:42.990 --> 09:45.659
Did his wife hire you herself? She didn't, right?

09:45.889 --> 09:47.559
She's the one who hired me.

09:48.029 --> 09:49.830
I'll have a lot to learn, so please help me out.

09:56.769 --> 09:59.399
I've downloaded the security camera footage from February 28.

09:59.700 --> 10:00.740
Thank you.

10:42.049 --> 10:43.049
The suspect is here.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.820
So, what happened when you got home?

10:46.990 --> 10:49.049
Exactly as you said the other day.

10:50.159 --> 10:51.389
I went in and killed her.

10:51.690 --> 10:54.830
I was so furious that I couldn't control my anger.

10:56.330 --> 10:57.330
That's why I killed her.

10:57.629 --> 10:58.659
Answer me.

11:00.230 --> 11:01.429
Did you really kill her?

11:02.629 --> 11:06.500
Goodness, I just told you that I did. Why don't you believe me?

11:07.009 --> 11:09.009
Why are you turning yourself in?

11:11.940 --> 11:12.980
Just because.

11:16.720 --> 11:17.850
Killing someone...

11:20.490 --> 11:21.490
can deeply agonize you.

11:23.759 --> 11:24.759
It's better to get locked up in jail...

11:25.860 --> 11:27.659
because it'll free me from this torture.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.370
I can't take this.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.710
I need peace of mind.

11:45.009 --> 11:46.080
I'm doing it for peace of mind.

11:55.919 --> 11:57.759
The killer who murdered Park Ji Yeong,

11:57.759 --> 11:59.019
the vice-chairwoman of Daesung Pulp,

11:59.019 --> 12:00.059
turned himself in today.

12:00.490 --> 12:03.399
The killer is Ahn Jae Gu, the victim's stepson...

12:03.730 --> 12:07.429
and the eldest son of the former chairman of Daesung, Ahn Tae Dong.

12:08.529 --> 12:12.070
The police stated that he murdered the victim due to his resentment...

12:12.070 --> 12:14.269
toward her for selling Chairman Ahn's shares and running away...

12:14.570 --> 12:18.379
and that it was a spur-of-the-moment choice.

12:18.980 --> 12:21.879
The police also stated that the two of them have had...

12:22.080 --> 12:26.179
a hostile relationship since he returned from the US last year...

12:26.379 --> 12:28.820
as they didn't see eye to eye on matters related to inheritance.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.889
(Ministry of Justice)

13:07.460 --> 13:09.460
Mom, are you worried about something?

13:10.629 --> 13:11.659
No.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.929
Ji Hu, you've never told your friends at school...

13:16.000 --> 13:19.100
about Grandpa's company, right?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.740
Why would I?

13:20.940 --> 13:23.009
They'll call me Toilet Paper if they find out about Dad working...

13:23.210 --> 13:25.480
at a toilet paper company because they're so childish.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.549
Right. I'm glad you haven't told anyone.

13:29.149 --> 13:31.679
- Don't tell anyone, okay? - I won't.

13:44.529 --> 13:46.870
You didn't write anything in your English journal today.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.970
I want to do it only three times a week.

13:50.470 --> 13:53.809
I've been writing about sad stuff, so I don't want to write too often.

13:57.879 --> 13:58.909
Mom.

13:59.809 --> 14:02.110
I like this house. It smells nice here.

14:04.419 --> 14:07.590
I'm glad to hear that you're happy here. Mom is going to bed too, okay?

14:07.820 --> 14:09.320
Okay, sweet dreams.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.259
It's me.

14:46.889 --> 14:47.889
Hey.

14:50.429 --> 14:51.460
Is Ji Hu sleeping?

14:52.259 --> 14:53.259
Yes.

15:00.139 --> 15:01.210
I'm sorry, A Jin.

15:05.710 --> 15:06.710
Me too.

15:08.379 --> 15:09.450
I'm sorry about everything.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.649
Jae Gu...

15:13.850 --> 15:15.250
What should I do now?

15:17.590 --> 15:18.919
Why did he do such a thing?

15:22.990 --> 15:24.230
He turned himself in.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.769
We'll get his sentence mitigated.

15:29.830 --> 15:31.500
Let's do our best to help him out.

15:35.370 --> 15:36.509
Stop crying.

15:37.879 --> 15:41.110
After all, tomorrow is another day.

15:48.220 --> 15:49.289
I'm sorry.

15:53.990 --> 15:55.059
I shouldn't have...

15:58.000 --> 15:59.929
hired her.

16:06.809 --> 16:07.840
I'm sorry.

16:13.309 --> 16:14.610
I was the one...

16:16.879 --> 16:19.980
who introduced that painter to you...

16:23.090 --> 16:24.120
and Father met...

16:25.820 --> 16:27.460
that woman because of me.

16:30.029 --> 16:31.460
That's not your fault.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.370
Those who made the choices are at fault.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.889
- Namaste. - Namaste.

17:00.889 --> 17:01.889
Are things going well?

17:02.460 --> 17:04.160
- What things? - Everything.

17:07.029 --> 17:09.430
I heard that Pungsan kitchen's mistress is out of the picture now.

17:11.039 --> 17:14.509
His wife found out that he's actually in love with the mistress,

17:14.569 --> 17:15.910
so she cooked up a ruse.

17:15.940 --> 17:17.279
What kind of ruse?

17:18.140 --> 17:21.910
She hired a young, pretty girl as his maid.

17:22.450 --> 17:23.579
What? Why?

17:23.750 --> 17:25.180
Because she'd rather deal with him...

17:25.180 --> 17:27.250
lost in lust than in love with his mistress.

17:29.150 --> 17:31.720
And apparently, she told that maid all the details...

17:31.720 --> 17:34.160
about Park Bok Ja's death.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.789
What's my husband doing now?

18:08.890 --> 18:11.799
He's fighting with his girlfriend. He just left after the fight.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.730
I see. It's about time they start fighting.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.500
He'll probably get himself a new girlfriend soon.

18:19.740 --> 18:21.569
- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

18:22.740 --> 18:24.210
Would you like to watch a movie with me today?

18:25.109 --> 18:26.140
I'm off today.

18:28.509 --> 18:29.549
A movie?

18:30.119 --> 18:33.390
Yes, I want to know what kind of movies you like.

18:34.720 --> 18:35.720
I like movies.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.319
I like movies too.

18:38.589 --> 18:39.720
Then, let's go to the movies.

18:41.460 --> 18:42.630
Are you asking me out on a date?

18:44.359 --> 18:45.660
I guess so.

18:47.069 --> 18:48.470
I don't do those things.

18:49.700 --> 18:50.740
Let's just...

18:52.440 --> 18:53.509
How about we...

18:55.240 --> 18:56.240
Let's just have fun.

19:00.950 --> 19:02.480
I'll take a shower first.

19:13.089 --> 19:15.359
Hello, madam. Can I help you find something?

19:16.160 --> 19:18.230
Come this way. The latest collection is over there.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.170
Thank you very much.

19:28.410 --> 19:30.410
Isn't this cute? I think this one is cuter.

19:30.410 --> 19:31.410
It's so adorable.

19:31.880 --> 19:32.880
We'll get this one and...

19:36.609 --> 19:39.180
There's a heart here. That's what I love the most.

19:39.180 --> 19:40.220
Look at this flower here.

19:43.089 --> 19:44.089
I love this heart.

19:51.329 --> 19:52.359
What's the title?

19:52.900 --> 19:53.930
"Curtain Call".

19:55.000 --> 19:56.529
- "Curtain Call"? - Yes.

19:56.970 --> 19:59.740
"Curtain call" refers to performers appearing on stage again...

19:59.869 --> 20:02.740
in response to the audience's applause after their performance.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.180
Is that how you interpreted the notion of death?

20:07.250 --> 20:09.579
My gosh, Yun Seong Hui.

20:09.849 --> 20:11.380
You're very talented.

20:12.250 --> 20:15.049
- Just be careful with guys, okay? - Okay.

20:15.490 --> 20:17.359
How did you come up with this idea?

20:19.019 --> 20:22.829
Ms. Kim, we have to prepare the caption for this painting,

20:22.890 --> 20:25.200
- so take notes of what she says. - No problem.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.599
Oh, right. Have you sent the payment for her painting that we sold?

20:29.799 --> 20:30.799
Yes, I have.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.170
A Jin gave me the go-ahead to send your payment.

20:35.410 --> 20:38.240
That's how the curtain was rung down on my stage called life.

20:39.279 --> 20:42.910
My life, which received no applause,

20:43.450 --> 20:44.619
ended like this.

20:47.349 --> 20:49.250
What made her happy was...

20:49.690 --> 20:52.059
neither fancy purses nor expensive shoes.

20:52.519 --> 20:55.789
However, she was embarking on a new chapter of her life...

20:55.789 --> 20:59.029
and she decided to be her own cheerleader...

20:59.160 --> 21:00.200
in her new journey.

21:06.369 --> 21:09.539
Then, there are people who show us that even the glass ceiling...

21:10.039 --> 21:11.710
and the glass floor can be broken.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.009
All right, it looks good.

21:15.109 --> 21:16.410
Here you go.

21:16.849 --> 21:18.150
That seals the deal.

21:18.150 --> 21:19.319
(Building Purchase Agreement)

21:19.319 --> 21:21.819
Just like that, she has broken the glass ceiling and she keeps on...

21:21.920 --> 21:24.859
- Congratulations. - moving up in the world.

21:33.670 --> 21:35.869
The magic wand that enabled her to break the glass ceiling...

21:36.269 --> 21:38.599
and climb the social ladder.

21:45.710 --> 21:48.410
Surprisingly enough, her magic wand was...

21:49.009 --> 21:51.720
the flavor enhancer that everyone knows.

22:01.990 --> 22:03.559
Do you have any radish kimchi?

22:03.960 --> 22:05.200
Just eat it, will you?

22:15.170 --> 22:16.210
Eat it with that.

22:25.680 --> 22:27.150
The kimchi is ripe and delicious.

22:27.720 --> 22:31.390
You think it's delicious? It tastes like it has a ton of MSG.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.400
Dad.

22:40.529 --> 22:44.569
We hired a lawyer at the best law firm in the country for Jae Gu.

22:48.809 --> 22:50.980
By the way, where's Ju Mi? I also haven't seen Un Gyu.

22:51.279 --> 22:52.740
Ju Mi went to work...

22:53.410 --> 22:54.750
and Un Gyu is abroad now to study English.

22:55.109 --> 22:56.250
He left a while ago.

22:59.349 --> 23:00.849
Dad, you should eat more.

23:01.619 --> 23:03.819
It's okay. I don't have much appetite.

23:12.529 --> 23:13.529
By the way,

23:14.230 --> 23:17.539
we need to go through all the assets she left behind and sort things out,

23:18.099 --> 23:20.470
but I just can't bring it up to Dad now.

23:20.670 --> 23:23.210
Is money the only thing you care about? We have to help Jae Gu first.

23:24.180 --> 23:26.710
Hey, that woman is dead,

23:26.950 --> 23:29.380
so we won't need to start a lawsuit to get the shares back, right?

23:29.779 --> 23:30.819
I have no idea.

23:31.150 --> 23:34.420
Hey, you can't be that hands-off about it.

23:34.549 --> 23:35.890
You're jobless now.

23:37.019 --> 23:39.390
We should settle the dispute over the assets once and for all.

23:39.390 --> 23:41.230
Gosh, seriously. Enough, okay?

23:41.930 --> 23:44.099
- Is it the right time for that? - What's your problem?

23:45.329 --> 23:47.799
Legally, half of the money she left behind...

23:48.130 --> 23:51.539
should go to Dad because he's her spouse and the rest is ours.

23:51.839 --> 23:53.740
We should take this as an opportunity to sort that out.

23:53.809 --> 23:55.069
Goodness.

23:57.210 --> 23:58.210
By the way,

23:59.839 --> 24:01.509
don't you think Dad looks so much healthier now?

24:03.210 --> 24:04.650
That woman did help him a lot.

24:27.369 --> 24:28.470
What's going on with Mr. Oh?

24:29.309 --> 24:31.680
I heard that he decided to stay at Gangil Group.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.509
I see.

24:36.009 --> 24:37.019
Sir.

24:39.250 --> 24:41.990
I actually got a call from Mr. Ahn Jae Gu...

24:42.319 --> 24:44.190
a few days before Ms. Park passed away.

24:44.490 --> 24:45.519
What did he say?

24:45.990 --> 24:49.890
He told me that Mr. Oh has been Ms. Park's right-hand man...

24:50.599 --> 24:53.200
and that I should tell you not to trust him.

24:53.869 --> 24:55.970
He asked me to make sure I pass the message along to you.

24:56.269 --> 24:57.769
Wasn't it you?

24:59.170 --> 25:00.839
I thought it was you.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.710
Does that mean you knew everything?

25:03.839 --> 25:06.579
Of course. How could I not have known?

25:07.809 --> 25:10.450
Then why did you do those things?

25:10.779 --> 25:13.890
There are things that you just can't pull yourself away from.

25:16.190 --> 25:17.190
I...

25:19.359 --> 25:22.430
I liked her a lot.

25:43.619 --> 25:45.549
Is there anything you want to say to me?

25:52.759 --> 25:53.789
Dad.

25:55.259 --> 25:56.259
Yes.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.470
Please take good care of Un Gyu and my wife for me.

26:05.369 --> 26:06.769
I don't resent you.

26:16.279 --> 26:17.319
I'm sorry.

26:20.089 --> 26:21.789
I'll do everything in my power...

26:23.190 --> 26:24.619
to help you.

26:28.029 --> 26:29.490
Please take care of your health.

26:59.490 --> 27:01.730
(Real estate title records)

27:01.789 --> 27:04.160
(Owner: Woo A Jin. 105 UN Top Village, unit 303)

27:04.400 --> 27:06.359
I transferred it back to your name.

27:09.630 --> 27:13.440
Let's end the litigations and our dispute over the assets here.

27:13.910 --> 27:15.269
- A Jin. - Yes?

27:16.009 --> 27:17.079
Don't you pity me?

27:17.410 --> 27:18.539
Why should I pity you?

27:18.980 --> 27:21.809
My wife left me and I even lost my job.

27:22.309 --> 27:24.480
And to top it all off, my brother is in jail for murder.

27:25.250 --> 27:28.119
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

27:29.890 --> 27:32.420
You think that the world revolves around you.

27:32.990 --> 27:34.289
You're right. I am like that.

27:35.029 --> 27:37.900
Even though I'm self-centered,

27:38.230 --> 27:39.529
I'm very modest.

27:39.660 --> 27:42.930
As an example, I think of myself as the earth and you as the sun.

27:43.569 --> 27:45.869
Right, and that woman is the moon.

27:47.140 --> 27:48.509
You're right. I did think like that.

27:49.740 --> 27:51.579
What would be the best way to make you understand it?

27:52.109 --> 27:53.380
Yes, that will be the quickest.

27:54.450 --> 27:57.420
From now on, you should think of yourself as the sun,

27:57.650 --> 27:58.819
not the earth.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.349
Try to think that you exist for the earth.

28:03.250 --> 28:07.160
I hope you realize not everything in the universe exists for you.

28:08.130 --> 28:09.859
Ji Hu must take after you.

28:10.799 --> 28:12.500
I can never understand what the two of you say.

28:13.130 --> 28:15.329
Well, that's also the reason why I love the two of you so much.

28:16.230 --> 28:19.200
You certainly don't need anyone's pity. Why?

28:20.970 --> 28:22.009
Because you're the sun.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.849
Ji Hu said she wants to hang out with you.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.619
Right.

28:39.759 --> 28:42.029
After all, tomorrow is another day.

28:46.599 --> 28:49.470
Ji Hu, Daddy has a lot of time today. Where shall we go?

28:49.769 --> 28:51.069
I don't have much time today.

28:51.869 --> 28:52.869
Really?

28:54.410 --> 28:56.440
Did you and Mom sort everything out without fighting?

28:56.710 --> 28:57.740
Yes, we did.

28:58.480 --> 29:01.079
Dad, shall we go somewhere and grab a bite to eat?

29:01.750 --> 29:02.750
Sure!

29:08.690 --> 29:09.720
Dad.

29:10.359 --> 29:13.059
You have to pull yourself together, okay?

29:13.589 --> 29:14.630
What do you mean?

29:14.690 --> 29:17.630
I'm worried about you because you're not a mentally strong person.

29:17.759 --> 29:20.470
I'm not mentally weak. What are you talking about?

29:20.730 --> 29:23.299
If Mom starts seeing another man...

29:23.599 --> 29:24.640
I can't allow that.

29:24.799 --> 29:28.039
Why can't you? I mean, you did it. Why can't Mom do it?

29:28.069 --> 29:29.440
She can't. She absolutely can't.

29:29.440 --> 29:33.650
Dad, you can no longer meddle in Mom's life.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.480
Dad, have you watched "The Lion King"?

29:39.779 --> 29:41.549
Of course. It's the animation with the lion.

29:41.819 --> 29:44.420
That's right. There's something the Lion King says in it.

29:44.789 --> 29:48.029
"The past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either..."

29:48.160 --> 29:49.390
"run from it or learn from it."

29:50.059 --> 29:52.900
I hope that you can learn from your past mistakes so that you can...

29:53.599 --> 29:55.400
I hope you can learn what's right and wrong.

29:56.970 --> 29:58.640
You don't want a lion to outsmart you, do you?

30:11.349 --> 30:12.349
Hey.

30:14.619 --> 30:16.319
Hey. Have you eaten yet?

30:16.589 --> 30:18.289
No, not yet. What about you?

30:18.460 --> 30:21.559
Well, you know what my answer will be. Let's go.

30:22.190 --> 30:23.660
Let me introduce you to Ms. Seo before we go.

30:23.700 --> 30:27.529
I've already introduced myself. I also gave out my business cards.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.529
Everything has been taken care of.

30:32.769 --> 30:35.509
I have a meeting in 20 minutes. It won't take long though.

30:35.769 --> 30:37.309
All right, I'll be looking at paintings here.

30:37.779 --> 30:39.509
Don't worry. Just go and have a fun date.

30:39.710 --> 30:41.680
I'm supposed to meet Pungsan Technology chairman's wife.

30:41.750 --> 30:44.519
She's going to hang out with me all day.

30:44.920 --> 30:48.250
I have to take her somewhere, so you can definitely step out.

30:49.019 --> 30:53.089
Thank you for being so considerate. We'll get going, then. Let's go.

31:05.700 --> 31:08.869
The restaurant we're going to is over there.

31:09.470 --> 31:12.109
It's 200m away from here.

31:12.779 --> 31:13.809
Right.

31:14.150 --> 31:17.819
Since our step lengths are different, we must stay focused...

31:18.380 --> 31:19.950
in order to keep our pace the same...

31:20.420 --> 31:22.420
so that we can walk side by side until we get to the restaurant.

31:23.460 --> 31:25.160
What are you trying to say?

31:32.359 --> 31:34.769
If we do this, we'll be able to relax...

31:35.299 --> 31:37.599
and enjoy our walk all the way there.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.900
What... What will happen to my husband?

32:07.269 --> 32:08.269
Park Bok Ja!

32:09.930 --> 32:10.940
Park Bok Ja?

32:11.569 --> 32:14.609
That new maid. She's possessed by Park Bok Ja.

32:15.569 --> 32:18.740
Are you saying Park Bok Ja's spirit is inside her body now?

32:18.880 --> 32:20.750
Why did you hire a girl like her as a maid?

32:22.579 --> 32:24.980
What should I do now?

32:24.980 --> 32:27.990
Just fire her. What else can you do?

32:27.990 --> 32:31.289
It's too late. I told you that she's possessed by that woman's spirit.

32:32.460 --> 32:33.789
What about my husband?

32:35.259 --> 32:37.829
Well, let me be clear on this.

32:39.430 --> 32:43.200
I never went into anyone's body.

32:43.839 --> 32:45.900
I can tell you for certain...

32:46.839 --> 32:49.140
that I'm not in their world.

32:55.450 --> 32:56.480
God.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.849
The case has been solved.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.519
Hey.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.289
You said that Ahn Jae Gu has a son, right?

33:03.759 --> 33:05.759
- Yes. - How old is his son?

33:05.890 --> 33:07.960
He's studying English in the US after his college entrance exam.

33:10.599 --> 33:11.599
Gosh.

33:11.930 --> 33:13.200
It must be a big shock to him.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.200
- Sweet dreams, Mom. - You too, my princess.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.750
"It was really delicious."

33:33.150 --> 33:35.690
February 28, Tuesday.

33:36.650 --> 33:39.990
My cousin called me late at night when I was asleep.

33:40.660 --> 33:43.029
I missed the call, so I called him back.

33:43.759 --> 33:47.000
He said, "I'll kill the devil tonight."

33:47.900 --> 33:51.700
"I suppose, after he finished the entrance exam,"

33:52.039 --> 33:55.069
"he must've been indulging himself in playing games."

33:56.339 --> 33:59.079
"His mission seems to be killing the devil,"

33:59.509 --> 34:01.680
"which must be the goal..."

34:02.150 --> 34:05.220
"or the character of the game he's been playing."

34:05.650 --> 34:07.220
"February 28..."

34:09.219 --> 34:10.789
That's after he left for the States.

34:13.929 --> 34:16.329
So, do you know if Un Gyu managed to beat the devil?

34:16.590 --> 34:17.599
What are you talking about?

34:19.730 --> 34:23.570
Sorry, I read what you wrote in your English journal.

34:23.969 --> 34:25.900
I wanted to make sure you're mentally healthy and happy.

34:26.909 --> 34:30.110
It's not an invasion of privacy, right? Don't get mad at me.

34:30.309 --> 34:33.550
It's fine. I left it on my desk because I don't mind you reading it.

34:33.710 --> 34:37.518
Right? It looks like you and Un Gyu talk often. I'm glad you are close.

34:37.650 --> 34:40.119
- We talk from time to time. - Is he doing well in the States?

34:40.889 --> 34:42.420
Is he in the States now?

34:42.590 --> 34:44.920
Yes, he's studying English there now.

34:45.119 --> 34:46.760
No, he didn't go to the States.

34:47.789 --> 34:48.789
What do you mean?

34:48.929 --> 34:50.559
He was in Korea when I last spoke to him.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.130
What?

34:54.268 --> 34:56.940
(Un Gyu)

35:10.219 --> 35:12.150
- Hello? - Hey.

35:13.019 --> 35:15.489
Un Gyu, why did you call me this late?

35:16.050 --> 35:18.659
I'll kill the devil tonight.

35:19.460 --> 35:20.489
The devil?

35:22.289 --> 35:23.429
It's raining, which is great.

35:25.730 --> 35:27.369
It's the perfect night to kill the devil.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.969
Un Gyu, did you call me to tell me this?

35:31.900 --> 35:33.539
I called because at least one person needs to know.

35:34.239 --> 35:35.769
Are you home now, Un Gyu?

35:36.510 --> 35:37.539
Yes.

35:38.039 --> 35:40.750
Don't get too addicted to games, okay?

35:48.889 --> 35:50.920
- Have a good day. - See you later.

35:50.920 --> 35:51.920
Bye.

36:12.809 --> 36:15.010
"He said... out of the blue, Un Gyu said,"

36:15.280 --> 36:18.280
"I'll kill the devil tonight."

36:18.920 --> 36:21.849
"I thought that killing the devil must be the goal of the game..."

36:21.849 --> 36:23.590
"he has been playing."

36:27.730 --> 36:28.760
Un Gyu!

36:30.260 --> 36:31.400
Aunt A Jin.

36:51.079 --> 36:52.119
You.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.320
Get out!

36:58.590 --> 37:00.030
You killed a man!

37:00.289 --> 37:02.630
I wasn't the one who killed him!

37:03.400 --> 37:05.559
It was an accident! How many times have I told you?

37:05.559 --> 37:08.530
- Shut up! - You treat me like an insect!

37:09.699 --> 37:10.869
You son of a gun!

37:11.670 --> 37:12.699
Chairman Ahn!

37:12.840 --> 37:15.170
Your wife and kid.

37:16.539 --> 37:20.050
If you want them to be treated like human beings in this household,

37:20.050 --> 37:23.550
you better keep your mouth shut.

37:23.949 --> 37:25.980
Are you crazy?

37:26.789 --> 37:29.150
If you spew that kind of nonsense once more,

37:30.789 --> 37:33.690
your wife and son will get kicked out too.

37:35.690 --> 37:37.030
This is your last warning.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.110
He's mistaken.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.550
He took my blanket, so...

37:57.550 --> 37:59.650
So, that's why you were going to sleep next to me?

37:59.780 --> 38:02.389
No. That wasn't it, my blanket...

38:02.989 --> 38:04.289
What do you think you are doing?

38:04.690 --> 38:07.460
I've already killed someone before.

38:07.659 --> 38:09.659
1st time, it's hard. The 2nd time, not so much.

38:10.630 --> 38:11.630
Shoot.

38:12.460 --> 38:15.099
If you don't shoot me here, you'll look ridiculous.

38:15.570 --> 38:18.400
Shoot me!

38:18.440 --> 38:21.639
- You can't do this. - Let go!

38:21.639 --> 38:23.579
- You can't do this. - What in the hell is going on?

38:36.690 --> 38:38.719
- Ju Mi. - Don't.

38:40.989 --> 38:43.699
I'm sorry. I'll go back to America.

38:44.730 --> 38:48.329
Don't go. Claim what belongs to you and Un Gyu, first.

38:48.829 --> 38:50.900
You can't back down. We are...

38:51.969 --> 38:53.239
on the edge of a cliff right now.

38:53.300 --> 38:54.840
It's all useless.

38:54.909 --> 38:57.940
No, if you can't do that, do something before you go.

38:59.480 --> 39:00.909
- Like what? - At least...

39:02.780 --> 39:04.179
kill that woman before you go.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.300
I'm sorry.

39:53.530 --> 39:55.369
I'm sorry, Un Gyu.

40:09.210 --> 40:10.219
Un Gyu.

40:12.550 --> 40:13.590
It's me, Dad.

40:14.289 --> 40:15.949
I heard you'll leave for the States in two days.

40:16.760 --> 40:19.920
Come and see me before you leave.

40:22.559 --> 40:23.559
I miss you.

40:45.519 --> 40:46.789
You must've had drunk before.

40:52.389 --> 40:54.530
I wanted to go to a sauna with you...

40:56.429 --> 40:58.199
and I also wanted to help you...

40:59.199 --> 41:00.730
the very first time you shaved,

41:02.130 --> 41:03.170
but I couldn't.

41:06.099 --> 41:07.139
Here.

41:10.179 --> 41:12.039
I want to at least teach you how to drink.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.610
I should teach you so that you know how to drink properly.

41:21.420 --> 41:22.519
Why didn't you come back sooner?

41:26.019 --> 41:27.059
I'm sorry.

41:27.190 --> 41:28.289
Mom and I...

41:31.000 --> 41:32.099
We were very lonely.

41:36.300 --> 41:37.340
I'm sorry.

41:47.510 --> 41:48.550
I...

41:50.349 --> 41:51.449
I won't go to the States.

42:01.289 --> 42:03.699
You dropped that knife at the scene.

42:06.559 --> 42:07.599
You didn't know, did you?

42:08.500 --> 42:09.500
What?

42:13.139 --> 42:14.409
You found this at the scene?

42:38.900 --> 42:39.900
Hey.

42:40.530 --> 42:43.300
Let's sleep at a bed-and-breakfast. It's too cold out here.

42:43.440 --> 42:46.840
Let's try sleeping here first. I've always wanted to do this.

42:59.179 --> 43:01.320
Inmate number 8516, you have a visitor.

43:19.500 --> 43:21.139
You should move to the States with Un Gyu.

43:23.010 --> 43:25.179
Ohio is a great place to live.

43:27.010 --> 43:28.309
He can go to university there too.

43:29.480 --> 43:32.449
But I guess that means you'll have to quit your job here.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.389
I'll wait.

43:39.719 --> 43:41.190
We'll wait for you there.

43:46.199 --> 43:47.230
Thank you.

43:49.300 --> 43:50.300
And...

43:51.800 --> 43:52.840
I'm sorry.

43:56.510 --> 43:57.940
Gosh...

44:00.079 --> 44:01.809
I feel a bit better now.

44:03.519 --> 44:04.550
I've always...

44:06.820 --> 44:08.619
felt bad because I've done nothing...

44:10.860 --> 44:13.190
for you and Un Gyu.

44:29.309 --> 44:33.079
(February 28, 1:40am)

44:43.690 --> 44:45.260
Hello? Mr. Kim?

44:47.860 --> 44:49.260
I'm at the hospital now.

44:50.429 --> 44:51.429
Just go home.

45:45.320 --> 45:48.650
(February 28, 1:42am)

46:18.650 --> 46:19.650
Un Gyu.

46:19.949 --> 46:23.559
Why did you do that? Why did you do that to me?

46:24.460 --> 46:26.289
Why did you treat my mom like that?

46:30.030 --> 46:33.769
- Weren't you in the States... - Why?

46:34.130 --> 46:36.429
I'm asking you why you treated us like that!

47:32.059 --> 47:34.260
(5 months after Park Bok Ja's death)

47:39.159 --> 47:41.530
Yun Jae, you know...

47:41.969 --> 47:44.239
that you have to call me every day from the States, right?

47:44.500 --> 47:45.539
Yes.

47:47.969 --> 47:51.409
Don't eat too much chocolate and don't forget to brush your teeth.

47:51.409 --> 47:54.550
I love you, Son. Mom loves you so much.

48:07.230 --> 48:09.329
Call me when you arrive, okay?

48:09.389 --> 48:11.030
Make sure you call me as soon as you arrive.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.130
Mom loves you.

48:15.929 --> 48:17.239
You have to call me!

48:18.869 --> 48:20.239
They weren't the only ones...

48:21.440 --> 48:23.070
who were parting ways.

49:06.619 --> 49:09.849
It's too bad, but what can you do? Just give up this time.

49:10.519 --> 49:13.530
Ms. Seo, that gallery is in New York.

49:14.289 --> 49:17.030
It's not in Seoul, so it shouldn't matter.

49:17.030 --> 49:18.960
It's not like social media's reach is limited to Seoul.

49:19.730 --> 49:21.969
Do you know how cutthroat overseas Korean communities can be?

49:22.199 --> 49:25.469
Besides, Gangnam have direct connections to Koreans in New York.

49:26.170 --> 49:28.840
Everybody knows that you had a relationship with a married man.

49:29.639 --> 49:31.980
Your artistic career might end if you aren't diplomatic this time.

49:32.010 --> 49:35.449
It's not fair. I feel so victimized.

49:35.710 --> 49:37.119
What is unfair?

49:38.820 --> 49:42.519
Everyone must pay for what they did.

49:42.590 --> 49:45.789
I've already paid for the mistake I made.

49:45.889 --> 49:47.059
How did you pay for it?

49:47.730 --> 49:50.500
Ms. Woo took all of my paintings.

49:50.659 --> 49:53.469
That's a deal you made with A Jin.

49:53.900 --> 49:56.130
The world hasn't punished you for it yet.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.369
It looks like you still have no idea how this world works.

49:59.570 --> 50:02.010
The show in New York isn't even important now.

50:03.239 --> 50:06.409
Hey, you should change your name too.

50:06.610 --> 50:08.110
Oh, I guess you can't do that.

50:08.280 --> 50:10.349
Your name is already registered in the association.

50:13.050 --> 50:14.820
You should just never show your face in public.

50:15.250 --> 50:17.519
No publicity activities for you whatsoever.

50:17.659 --> 50:19.460
Just paint and do nothing else.

50:22.230 --> 50:23.289
Do you want fame?

50:23.289 --> 50:25.059
If you get a taste of it,

50:25.159 --> 50:26.429
you'll realize that it's not that big of a deal.

50:30.269 --> 50:32.099
That son of a gun.

50:43.780 --> 50:44.880
Hurry up, guys!

50:53.690 --> 50:56.130
Let's eat a ton of sashimi here.

50:59.530 --> 51:03.170
When he saw the woman holding a knife,

51:03.539 --> 51:06.500
he felt that fate must be working its magic in inexplicable ways.

51:09.039 --> 51:12.909
He also thought that she may be happy to become the earth for him.

51:14.250 --> 51:16.050
He obviously had no interest...

51:16.349 --> 51:19.920
in learning from his past mistakes.

51:22.889 --> 51:25.159
We'd like to offer you the position of executive director...

51:25.460 --> 51:27.289
of our design team.

51:28.329 --> 51:30.329
As for your salary, we'll match...

51:30.400 --> 51:32.929
what the top- notch designers are making and you'll also get a bonus.

51:34.469 --> 51:36.000
Thank you very much for the offer.

51:37.099 --> 51:39.539
But at the moment, I'd like to focus on growing my brand...

51:39.539 --> 51:41.409
on my own.

51:42.610 --> 51:46.780
It'll be great if we can work together strategically in future.

51:48.849 --> 51:50.280
What do you think about my proposal?

51:53.079 --> 51:56.250
I think your brand will soon become our biggest competition.

51:57.690 --> 51:58.860
I wish you all the best.

52:00.030 --> 52:02.730
She started afresh in every aspect.

52:03.929 --> 52:06.400
The comfort which the heater and sunroof once gave her.

52:07.670 --> 52:09.869
By giving it up,

52:10.570 --> 52:12.769
she gained true freedom.

52:14.539 --> 52:18.639
Not everyone can enjoy such freedom.

52:19.909 --> 52:21.050
The breeze feels nice.

52:24.349 --> 52:25.480
Perhaps it was...

52:26.750 --> 52:28.789
her privilege.

52:33.059 --> 52:35.989
I'll go pick up some coffee for us and juice for the kids.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.469
Ms. Baek, I'm so happy these days.

52:42.769 --> 52:43.769
You look happy.

52:44.199 --> 52:46.139
Every day is so precious.

52:47.039 --> 52:48.110
I can tell.

52:49.909 --> 52:52.679
There are so many unfortunate people who feel that the morning sun...

52:52.679 --> 52:54.610
is nothing but a nuisance that wakes them up.

52:56.050 --> 52:58.880
Happiness is like the sunlight.

52:59.849 --> 53:03.119
You can't help but be grateful if you think it brings a new morning.

53:04.219 --> 53:06.860
From now on, I'll just enjoy everything...

53:06.989 --> 53:08.590
that the world has given me for free.

53:09.530 --> 53:11.260
Word. How wise.

53:11.329 --> 53:12.829
I want to write it down somewhere.

53:14.269 --> 53:16.940
All right, kids. In Jae, this is yours.

53:16.940 --> 53:18.199
Thank you.

53:18.800 --> 53:19.940
This is yours, Ji Hu.

53:20.210 --> 53:21.409
Thank you.

53:21.940 --> 53:24.739
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kang Gi Ho.

53:24.809 --> 53:26.039
I'm Ji Hu Ahn.

53:26.510 --> 53:27.679
I've heard so much about you.

53:27.780 --> 53:29.849
Mr. Kang, you're Mom's partner, right?

53:30.219 --> 53:31.920
Yes, I'm your mom's partner.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.550
You know that partners must get along, right?

53:34.920 --> 53:37.190
Yes, I do. Help me out, okay?

53:37.690 --> 53:39.090
Okay, I will.

53:40.190 --> 53:43.900
My gosh. I must say, you look so much like your mom.

53:45.329 --> 53:46.329
Mr. Kang.

53:46.829 --> 53:49.570
Do you know what my mom's favorite food is?

53:52.570 --> 53:53.570
It's kimchi stew.

53:56.809 --> 53:59.110
You'll need my number. You asked me for help.

54:00.250 --> 54:01.280
Right.

54:02.250 --> 54:03.280
Here.

54:09.550 --> 54:12.190
My parents' marriage ended like that,

54:12.420 --> 54:14.460
but I still love my dad very much.

54:15.030 --> 54:17.130
If you can be understanding about that,

54:17.199 --> 54:19.199
I'd like to open up to you and get along with you.

54:19.260 --> 54:21.099
Of course. I definitely understand.

54:22.469 --> 54:24.800
You'll be understanding about me...

54:25.239 --> 54:26.300
wanting to be close with your mom, right?

54:26.570 --> 54:28.869
Yes. I'm relieved now that I've met you in person.

54:29.539 --> 54:31.840
Really? Am I all right?

54:32.380 --> 54:34.949
Yes, you have kind eyes.

54:35.480 --> 54:37.320
Seriously? My goodness.

54:38.119 --> 54:40.219
Ji Hu, you're definitely...

54:41.019 --> 54:44.059
the most awesome 11-year-old kid I've ever met. I mean it.

54:44.719 --> 54:47.130
Thank you. What a thoughtful compliment.

54:47.360 --> 54:50.130
That made my day. This juice is delicious too.

54:50.199 --> 54:51.199
Is it?

54:54.199 --> 54:55.800
You should go to Mom.

54:56.030 --> 54:57.039
All right.

About their son, Un Gyu Ahn...

55:54.059 --> 55:55.690
I asked those at the Immigration Service,

55:55.690 --> 55:56.960
but he actually never left the country.

56:56.760 --> 56:59.260
What's the name of the guest in the suite?

57:00.889 --> 57:01.929
It's Ms. Woo A Jin.

57:03.260 --> 57:04.730
Woo A Jin. Thank you.

57:07.769 --> 57:08.800
Oh, hello.

57:09.929 --> 57:11.900
I managed to get the wine stain off, madam.

57:11.969 --> 57:13.840
I see. Thank you.

57:19.809 --> 57:20.809
Ms. Park.

57:21.809 --> 57:22.809
Yes.

57:30.389 --> 57:32.690
Thank you so much for washing my clothes perfectly.

57:33.019 --> 57:34.889
May happiness surround you always, wherever you go.

58:01.420 --> 58:03.590
Everyone dreams of being happy.

58:04.219 --> 58:06.690
We all desire things that we don't have.

58:07.730 --> 58:09.659
We think that having those things will make us happy.

58:10.860 --> 58:14.699
However, happiness can only make our lives more abundant...

58:15.099 --> 58:18.000
when we free ourselves from such desires.

58:19.070 --> 58:21.469
I'm happy now.

58:22.510 --> 58:25.110
I'm happy now.
