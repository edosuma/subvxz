00:01.110 --> 00:04.010
Previously on damages:

00:04.370 --> 00:06.150
Uh, I'm ellen parsons.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.510
I'm here to interview.

00:08.530 --> 00:09.930
You're hired.

00:09.960 --> 00:15.210
A young lawyer with a fantastic
new job and a dreamy doctor fianc?

00:15.820 --> 00:19.730
Arthur frobisher told his
employees to invest in the company,

00:19.760 --> 00:21.420
and then sold his own stock.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.070
It's classic
pump-and-dump.

00:23.090 --> 00:24.300
Let her depose me.

00:24.340 --> 00:25.520
We're going to trial, ray.

00:25.530 --> 00:29.030
There are 5,000 people
who lost everything.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.730
They deserve justice.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.340
I mopped your floors 34 years.

00:33.350 --> 00:35.470
I cleaned your shit!

00:35.480 --> 00:36.880
You watch what you say.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.000
*******

00:39.010 --> 00:41.640
I'm done here.

00:44.130 --> 00:46.310
********

00:46.320 --> 00:48.920
You're blackmailing me, patty.

00:51.890 --> 00:55.580
No one can ever know
what he was doing here.

00:55.590 --> 00:58.120
You're a lawyer. Lies
come with the territory.

00:58.130 --> 00:59.990
Make up your mind, ellen.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.710
Do you want to play mind games like these
people, or do you want to be yourself?

01:03.720 --> 01:05.180
We crossed a line.

01:05.190 --> 01:08.480
Do you regret what we did? Because I do.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.950
You do?

01:09.960 --> 01:13.650
While I'm gone, you're
welcome to stay here.

01:21.570 --> 01:23.670
It's done.

01:24.190 --> 01:27.330
I'm agent harrison. This is
agent werner. We're with the fbi.

01:27.340 --> 01:28.630
What is this about?

01:28.640 --> 01:29.940
It's about patricia hewes.

01:29.970 --> 01:33.770
Mr. Nye tells us you might have reasons of
your own for wanting to take down ms. Hewes.

01:33.780 --> 01:35.280
She tried to kill me.

01:35.300 --> 01:36.530
Come back, ellen.

01:36.550 --> 01:39.280
I'll come work for you
again on one condition.

01:39.310 --> 01:43.650
Let me use the firm's resources to
prove that frobisher had david killed.

01:45.450 --> 01:46.210
It's a deal.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.970
You want me to go back and work for her?

01:48.990 --> 01:50.610
Miss parsons...

01:50.630 --> 01:52.090
you will be working for us.

01:52.110 --> 01:54.410
See you on monday.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:15.440 --> 02:17.640
What's the matter?

02:17.650 --> 02:20.280
You shouldn't be scared.

02:24.130 --> 02:26.600
Actually...

02:27.160 --> 02:29.570
I take that back.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.030
You should be scared.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.970
You should be terrified.

02:43.770 --> 02:48.580
It would just be so much
easier if you said the words.

02:52.430 --> 02:56.150
I can never remember
the name of this song.

03:04.290 --> 03:07.040
All I want you to do is tell the truth.

03:09.620 --> 03:12.470
But I know that can be hard for you...

03:12.750 --> 03:14.990
so...

03:16.460 --> 03:19.630
I brought something that
i thought might help.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.250
And who knows?

03:27.270 --> 03:29.800
Maybe the truth will set you free.

03:34.270 --> 03:37.680
6 MONTHS EARLIER

03:42.340 --> 03:46.050
And now, here's one of our good
friends, just off a big courtroom win.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.330
- Please welcome back patty hewes.
- Yes!

03:50.990 --> 03:52.770
Yes, look who's here!

03:52.780 --> 03:56.010
- Patty, it's so good to see you.
- You're gorgeous.

03:56.020 --> 03:59.780
- You're stunning. Good to see you.
- It is great to be here.

03:59.790 --> 04:01.380
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

04:01.390 --> 04:03.160
- You look good, patty.
- Thank you.

04:03.170 --> 04:05.240
Oh, boy. So, be honest now.

04:05.250 --> 04:08.860
- How much did you rake in on this latest case of yours?
- Oh, regis!

04:08.870 --> 04:11.840
What? Really, what was it,
two-billion dollar settlement?

04:11.850 --> 04:14.740
People want to know how
rich she is-- you know that.

04:14.750 --> 04:17.610
Well, I'll tell you if you tell me.

04:17.620 --> 04:20.440
Gelman, gelman, what do I make?

04:20.450 --> 04:22.230
What do I make, the union scale?

04:22.240 --> 04:24.660
Of course, that's all. That's all I got.

04:24.670 --> 04:27.730
Oh, please. So, tell us
about this arthur frobisher.

04:27.740 --> 04:29.480
Pretty wealthy guy, right?

04:29.500 --> 04:31.600
Not anymore.

04:33.390 --> 04:35.640
our plaintiffs were
very well taken care of.

04:35.660 --> 04:37.680
So, what are you gonna
do with all that money?

04:38.040 --> 04:41.660
Well, actually, I'm gonna use a good
portion of the money to fund a foundation

04:41.670 --> 04:44.580
to fight hunger in new york city.

04:46.980 --> 04:49.190
It's very important to
give back to the community.

04:49.210 --> 04:54.990
Yeah, I think so, and I'm also partnering in
the charity with my good friend, sam arsenault.

04:56.990 --> 05:01.380
Saving the world's great, but you've got to be
chomping at the bit to take your next case, huh?

05:01.390 --> 05:02.830
Not at the moment.

05:02.850 --> 05:07.410
It's my son's last year in high school, and
this charity is keeping my hands pretty full.

05:07.430 --> 05:10.920
Wow, that's amazing.I mean, you know,
a high-profile attorney, of course,

05:10.930 --> 05:13.070
but committed mother working full-time.

05:13.090 --> 05:15.190
I don't know how you
manage to balance it all.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.650
Well, I mean, you...
you do the same thing.

05:17.660 --> 05:21.500
It is difficult, but I have
a fantastic team at the firm.

05:21.520 --> 05:24.800
You know, I believe i chatted with one of
your associates backstage in the green room.

05:24.810 --> 05:26.010
Ellen parsons, yeah. She's fantastic.

05:26.020 --> 05:28.910
Isn't she standing in the wings?
You want to say hello, ellen?

05:28.920 --> 05:31.870
- Ellen!
- There she is.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.850
Ellen's been with, uh...

05:34.870 --> 05:37.310
she's been with the
firm not even a year.

05:37.320 --> 05:43.490
And I can tell you, I would be absolutely lost
without her, so she deserves a lot of credit.

05:59.940 --> 06:02.160
The woman's full of shit.

06:02.600 --> 06:06.250
A month ago, she tried to kill me, and
now she's acting like my best friend.

06:06.260 --> 06:09.580
The bureau's putting together
a case we'll want patty to take.

06:09.610 --> 06:11.270
We're gonna need you to pitch it to her.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.230
Okay. What is it?

06:13.240 --> 06:14.860
A setup.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.590
We'll use you to monitor
it from the inside.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.590
Great. When do we start?

06:20.600 --> 06:24.860
Soon, ellen. We're just
working out a few details.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.450
How soon?

06:27.880 --> 06:30.930
You got to relax, okay? Lay low.

06:31.270 --> 06:32.860
That's easy for you to say.

06:32.870 --> 06:35.080
You just want to arrest patty hewes.

06:35.100 --> 06:38.280
- And you don't?
- I want to destroy her.

08:34.390 --> 08:38.179
Oh, no. No. Please.

08:40.390 --> 08:46.190
Revenge fantasies are normal when
we're dealing with posttraumatic stress.

08:46.640 --> 08:52.630
See, the right side of the
brain tries to process our trauma

08:52.640 --> 08:56.910
to help us understand
what we've been through.

08:57.850 --> 09:00.280
Ellen, how about you?

09:00.290 --> 09:05.670
Have you had any more revenge fantasies about
the man that you think killed your fianc?

09:08.750 --> 09:10.390
No!

09:16.870 --> 09:19.660
Nothing comes to mind.

09:19.670 --> 09:23.760
Ellen is in counseling
three or four times a week.

09:23.770 --> 09:27.590
She's moving to the
sullivan grand hotel.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.690
You don't need to
watch her anymore, pete.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.880
Are you sure you can trust her?

09:35.880 --> 09:37.950
Maybe it's best if I keep an eye on her.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.500
No. That's all in the past.

09:43.010 --> 09:45.040
Okay.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.890
Fine. Watch her.

09:51.050 --> 09:54.190
I'm concerned about her well-being.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.000
Tommy.

10:02.010 --> 10:05.030
So, you gonna make me say it?

10:06.400 --> 10:09.890
How about today? You
ready to jump back in?

10:09.900 --> 10:12.690
The firm is trying plenty of cases.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.790
But you aren'T.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.960
I hear what you're saying.

10:17.520 --> 10:21.070
Good. All right, I'll bring you
the top three cases, and you just...

10:21.080 --> 10:23.700
you pick the one you like.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.080
Excuse me.

10:35.570 --> 10:39.060
We're hearing rumors their findings
could come out as soon as next month.

10:39.070 --> 10:41.850
The kentucky operations
have been calling in nonstop.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.180
They're getting nervous about new york.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.400
Tell them to relax. We're prepared.

10:45.410 --> 10:48.140
Assure them that there's
nothing to worry about.

10:48.160 --> 10:51.440
Mr. Purcell? Mr. Purcell.

10:58.900 --> 10:59.970
This isn't my work.

11:00.010 --> 11:02.570
Mr. Purcell, calm down.

11:02.590 --> 11:06.820
This is... horseshit.

11:07.370 --> 11:08.890
I'm not gonna sign off on this.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.830
We're in a meeting here.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.990
A very important meeting?

11:18.600 --> 11:22.210
This ends today. You hear me?

11:33.890 --> 11:36.670
Where are we with the irs?

11:36.680 --> 11:41.350
They expedited our charitable tax-exempt status
based on sam arsenault's verbal commitment,

11:41.360 --> 11:44.060
so as soon as he makes it
official, we're off to the races.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.290
With any luck, we can
start doing some good.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.900
That's the general idea.

11:51.380 --> 11:54.800
- What, ellen?
- Nothing.

11:54.810 --> 11:56.720
I think the foundation's great.

11:56.730 --> 11:59.430
It will leave an
imprint for generations.

12:03.910 --> 12:05.540
No.

12:05.550 --> 12:09.290
You think I'm just creating
this to clear my conscience.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.470
Why would you need to
clear your conscience?

12:13.480 --> 12:16.160
Because of what we did
to win the frobisher case.

12:16.170 --> 12:18.600
You mean, ray fiske's suicide?

12:18.610 --> 12:21.470
My conscience is clear about that.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.060
So how are you doing?

12:32.590 --> 12:36.490
- Counseling...
- No, I'D... rather not talk about it.

12:37.240 --> 12:44.270
Well, I just want you to know you
can have time off if you ever need it.

12:46.060 --> 12:49.260
Work's the best thing for me right now.

12:49.270 --> 12:51.400
Where are you on frobisher?

12:51.410 --> 12:54.290
Is there anything new on david's murder?

12:54.300 --> 12:57.410
Has my investigator been helpful?

12:57.430 --> 13:01.310
He found out frobisher was in
critical condition after the shooting.

13:01.330 --> 13:05.400
A construction crew found him and
had him airlifted to st. Anthony'S.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.900
He had abdominal surgery there.

13:07.910 --> 13:10.580
- Last week, he was transferred.
- Where?

13:10.590 --> 13:14.120
Your guy doesn't know. There's
been a total press blackout.

13:14.130 --> 13:16.950
Frobisher doesn't want
anyone to find him.

13:27.150 --> 13:31.750
Mr. Frobisher? How you feeling?

13:34.120 --> 13:36.570
Like shit.

13:37.320 --> 13:41.990
Yeah, well, four surgeries in
a month will do that to you.

13:42.350 --> 13:43.980
How am I doing?

13:43.990 --> 13:46.960
The doc says the kidney should take.

13:50.670 --> 13:53.190
I'm parched.

14:07.340 --> 14:10.390
Thank you for taking
care of me like this.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.840
Just doing my job.

14:14.650 --> 14:17.730
You don't know who I am, do you?

14:17.740 --> 14:20.620
Of course I do. Why do you ask?

14:21.420 --> 14:24.970
'Cause I'm the most
hated man in america.

14:26.150 --> 14:29.480
And you're being nice to me.

14:43.220 --> 14:46.220
I want you on the board of directors.

14:46.230 --> 14:47.750
Of course you can say "no."

14:47.760 --> 14:50.640
But these things have a way of
coming to bite you on the ass.

14:50.650 --> 14:52.400
We have a big problem.

14:53.270 --> 14:56.810
Think about it, senator.
You've got 24 hours.

14:56.820 --> 14:57.550
What is it?

14:57.570 --> 15:00.350
Sam arsenault's people just
called. He's backing out.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.030
They didn't want to tell me over
the phone, but I forced their hand.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.670
He's withdrawing his entire
contribution from the foundation.

15:07.650 --> 15:10.270
Hey, what can i get you? Coffee? Latte?

15:10.280 --> 15:12.830
- Too early for bourbon?
- Never.

15:13.340 --> 15:15.700
Ah, girls today could learn
something from you, patty.

15:15.710 --> 15:19.650
You know how to wear a skirt, but
you're one of the boys, always have been.

15:19.660 --> 15:21.950
Ah, except for the vagina.

15:23.330 --> 15:26.360
I was just about to have one myself.

15:26.370 --> 15:28.870
Explain it to me, sam.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.120
The republican party is
going to back me for governor.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.420
But you're an independent.

15:34.430 --> 15:35.920
Not anymore.

15:35.930 --> 15:38.480
So I got party politics to worry about.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.940
The elephants don't like you, patty.

15:39.950 --> 15:42.790
I can't be pissing these
people off right now.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.570
I need your pledge, sam.

15:46.010 --> 15:48.960
Why are you doing this?

15:48.970 --> 15:51.460
Let me tell you a story.

15:51.470 --> 15:55.480
Back in '83, I was
negotiating the syntec merger.

15:55.510 --> 15:56.960
Neither side would budge.

15:56.980 --> 15:58.630
The clock was running down.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.580
Okay.

15:59.590 --> 16:03.100
So I toss all the
lawyers out of my office.

16:03.130 --> 16:08.580
I tell herb weiss to stop
over, hash it out mano a mano.

16:08.590 --> 16:11.010
The whole time herb
was in there with me,

16:11.040 --> 16:16.250
I've got this sizzling slice of ass from the
temp services under the desk taking dictation,

16:16.270 --> 16:17.960
if you get my drift.

16:17.980 --> 16:20.360
Yeah, it just wafted my way.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.390
Hey, relax. I married her.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.620
Jeanine?

16:24.630 --> 16:26.620
No. No, it was the one before that.

16:26.630 --> 16:29.530
Anyway, in the '80s, we
all did shit like that.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.650
The point is, why did I do it?

16:31.660 --> 16:34.290
Because I'm an asshole?
Because I want to feel powerful?

16:34.300 --> 16:35.990
All of the above?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.940
Nah, I don't give a shit about power.

16:37.960 --> 16:43.360
I'm just an old, free love hippie who
made a good bet on soybean options.

16:43.390 --> 16:46.240
I did it because...

16:46.250 --> 16:49.580
I wanted to see if I'd get away with it.

16:49.600 --> 16:54.580
Sam, you're making a big mistake.

16:55.040 --> 16:57.830
We could leave a real
mark with this foundation.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.370
Your daughter's here, mr. Arsenault.

16:59.380 --> 17:01.230
Great! Send her in.

17:01.590 --> 17:03.870
Sorry, patty. We're grabbing lunch.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.119
There's plenty of time for charity.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.670
We can save the world another day.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.589
Ms.Hewes. I'm sorry to interrupt.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.250
Oh, it's nice to see you, lily.

17:13.270 --> 17:16.480
I just ran into michael at this,
uh, college admissions thing.

17:16.490 --> 17:19.480
Lily's earned herself a spot at yale.

17:19.490 --> 17:21.180
Well, that's quite an accomplishment.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.069
Yeah, I can't wait.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.940
You want to join us for a quick bite?

17:24.970 --> 17:28.569
Oh, I'd love to. No, thanks.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.300
Hey, I'm sorry, patty.

17:31.310 --> 17:34.870
But, uh, I always wanted to
run off and join the circus.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.130
Well, be careful out there, sam.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.120
There are a lot of
clowns under the big top.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.940
Good luck at yale.

17:45.380 --> 17:47.770
This was hand-delivered.

17:47.790 --> 17:51.740
No return address. Security
x-rayed it. It's clean.

17:51.750 --> 17:54.040
You open it.

18:02.450 --> 18:04.500
What is it?

18:04.510 --> 18:08.010
Charts, graphs... I have no idea.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.400
Let me see.

18:12.560 --> 18:16.120
Ms.Hewes, I have a daniel
purcell on the phone for you.

18:16.130 --> 18:18.510
Danny purcell?

18:18.520 --> 18:20.950
When's the last time you talked to him?

18:20.960 --> 18:23.480
Ten years at least.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.090
All right, put him through.

18:34.350 --> 18:35.950
Daniel?

18:35.960 --> 18:37.390
Did the package arrive?

18:37.410 --> 18:39.680
Yes. What is it?

18:39.690 --> 18:41.920
Just keep it.

18:41.930 --> 18:44.580
Why did you send this to me?

18:45.690 --> 18:48.700
You're the only one I can trust.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.640
Please.

18:52.230 --> 18:54.320
Keep it safe.

18:54.340 --> 18:56.400
Daniel, I...

19:07.460 --> 19:09.680
So you want me to get
patty to take this case?

19:09.700 --> 19:12.230
Yeah. It's all in here.

19:12.240 --> 19:17.110
Researched and vetted, everything you need
to present a legitimate infant mortality case.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.750
Sounds right up patty's alley.

19:18.760 --> 19:22.820
Built in social cause,
persuasive lead plaintiff...

19:22.830 --> 19:24.910
billions in damages at
the end of the rainbow.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.880
It's great bait, but how are you
going to use this to arrest patty?

19:28.900 --> 19:30.510
One step at a time, ellen.

19:30.530 --> 19:34.980
First you get her to bite, then
we'll fill you in on the rest.

19:35.370 --> 19:38.040
Any questions?

19:38.050 --> 19:43.380
Bad car tires made in china, deep pockets
is a major distributor out of jersey.

19:43.400 --> 19:48.500
And it's wide: Over 14 million
units and 260 traffic deaths so far.

19:48.510 --> 19:50.700
Could be bigger than bridgestone.

19:50.710 --> 19:54.310
In this climate? Public hears
china, they scream bloody murder.

19:54.320 --> 19:58.320
We think the complaint can survive
a twombly motion. All we have to...

19:58.330 --> 20:01.740
I-I-I... I'm sorry,
patty. What's going on?

20:02.470 --> 20:04.410
Are we wasting our time?

20:04.430 --> 20:08.460
No. No, no, go on. I'm listening.

20:09.510 --> 20:11.720
Okay.

20:11.730 --> 20:14.820
We'll aim, aim a little higher.

20:14.840 --> 20:20.960
Ellen brought this in, and i
think she found a grand slam:

20:21.570 --> 20:23.770
Infant mortality.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.830
The first time in decades it's going up.

20:25.840 --> 20:28.450
- Why?
- Hmos.

20:28.460 --> 20:30.370
Caesarean births cost them a fortune.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.560
Insurance companies don't
want to pay, so at-risk,

20:32.580 --> 20:35.550
low-income women are being
forced into natural birth,

20:35.570 --> 20:37.790
and their babies are dying.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.310
There are billions of
dollars worth of damages here.

20:41.330 --> 20:42.060
Interesting.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.140
We can take on the insurance industry.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.870
We already have a lead
plaintiff lined up.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.510
She'd make an ideal front
person for a class action.

20:48.530 --> 20:51.640
Her name's monique bryant. She's
sympathetic. She has a story to tell.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.760
It's all in the file.

20:53.770 --> 20:57.020
All right. I'll look at it.

20:58.170 --> 21:01.690
I truly, truly believe
that this is the one.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.640
There are people in need here.
There are people we could help.

21:06.900 --> 21:09.700
Let me know what you think.

21:20.230 --> 21:22.660
You're not even going to
read it? Patty, come on.

21:22.670 --> 21:26.690
I have a foundation to
launch and I have no funding.

21:26.950 --> 21:29.200
We have our work cut out for us.

21:29.220 --> 21:30.390
Do you have a meeting tonight?

21:30.410 --> 21:31.200
I can cancel.

21:31.210 --> 21:33.920
No-no-no-no, that's
more important.

21:35.330 --> 21:38.960
- What's that?
- This? It's personal.

21:40.790 --> 21:44.290
And the last time I
checked, we are in my office.

21:52.630 --> 21:57.000
So I find the guy...

21:57.810 --> 22:01.080
just laying there. Still drunk.

22:01.820 --> 22:07.300
So I take a few steps back, like
I'm going to kick a field goal,

22:07.800 --> 22:12.030
and I kick his head right
here. Right under his chin.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.320
Well, his neck snaps back.

22:17.340 --> 22:21.430
The back of his head smacks
between his shoulder blades.

22:21.450 --> 22:26.090
And so I kick him again. Again.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.980
Over and over.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.610
And I'm wondering, "how many kicks is it
going to take before his head rips off?"

22:42.630 --> 22:45.210
but...

22:45.950 --> 22:48.970
I never found out 'cause I woke up.

22:48.990 --> 22:51.890
That's very powerful, wes.

22:54.260 --> 22:57.170
Ellen, how about you?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.980
Have you had any dreams this week?

23:00.990 --> 23:03.860
I can't sleep.

23:04.660 --> 23:08.670
Her fianc? was murdered a month
ago. How's she supposed to sleep?

23:20.020 --> 23:22.380
It's done.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.290
Mom?

23:32.580 --> 23:34.970
You fell asleep.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.770
oh, boy...

23:51.050 --> 23:52.430
what time is it?

23:52.450 --> 23:54.940
Almost 1:00. Dad called.

23:54.950 --> 23:57.830
He has to stay another week in dubai.

23:59.280 --> 24:01.220
You going to go up to bed?

24:01.240 --> 24:03.350
Yeah.

24:04.570 --> 24:07.060
Everything all right?

24:08.040 --> 24:12.030
Yeah... I'm fine, michael.

24:30.020 --> 24:31.930
Dad?

24:33.690 --> 24:35.830
Dad, I think someone's here.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.320
Hey, baby.

24:37.340 --> 24:39.400
I think someone's here.

24:40.860 --> 24:42.020
Where?

24:42.030 --> 24:46.080
Downstairs. I heard
him in the living room.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.180
What's going on?

25:10.580 --> 25:12.870
- Daniel!
- Call the police.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.910
- Daniel...
- Do it!

25:43.150 --> 25:45.890
you stay the hell away from my family!

25:47.520 --> 25:49.890
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

25:49.900 --> 25:53.280
Daniel, he was in your office!

26:10.370 --> 26:13.300
What were they looking for?

26:15.930 --> 26:17.170
You hear about lily?

26:17.190 --> 26:20.130
My god, sam, I am so sorry.

26:20.150 --> 26:22.430
Cops don't have anything else to do?

26:22.440 --> 26:24.410
They only went after her
because she's my daughter.

26:24.430 --> 26:25.420
You're right.

26:25.430 --> 26:29.850
The one time she tries cocaine, she gets
arrested and splashed all over the front pages.

26:29.860 --> 26:32.900
You got to help me, patty.
Uh, she's just a kid.

26:32.910 --> 26:35.170
This kind of thing
could sink her for life.

26:35.190 --> 26:36.680
What can I do?

26:36.690 --> 26:39.530
Call the da. Get him
to drop the charges.

26:39.540 --> 26:41.150
Why don't you call him?

26:41.190 --> 26:42.940
Ah, he hates me.

26:42.960 --> 26:46.370
I refused to testify in
that insider-trading thing.

26:48.420 --> 26:51.620
look, I know that he's
your friend, patty.

26:51.650 --> 26:53.750
He'll listen to you.

26:56.230 --> 26:59.190
look, we both know that you
got me by the short and curlies.

26:59.200 --> 27:03.240
But it's impossible for me to
join your foundation right now,

27:03.250 --> 27:05.120
so if that's what it's going to take...

27:05.140 --> 27:08.220
God, no, sam. I would never
hold you hostage like that.

27:08.230 --> 27:11.630
Our kids have known each
other since kindergarten.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.390
Oh, I'll make the
call, see what I can do.

27:14.410 --> 27:17.580
Thank you, patty. Thank you.

27:17.890 --> 27:21.260
No need to thank me,
sam. This is family.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.620
Sorry to interrupt.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.770
Frobisher is at the riveredge clinic.

27:29.520 --> 27:33.240
- What room?
- No... that won't help.

27:33.250 --> 27:37.050
He's under tight security.
Only his family's allowed in.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.710
Listen, ellen...

27:41.350 --> 27:44.840
if I were you, I'd want to
look him in the eye myself.

27:44.850 --> 27:47.140
But give it time.

27:47.160 --> 27:50.460
You'll get your shot to prosecute him.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.790
Thanks, pete.

28:02.170 --> 28:04.280
So, did they ever arrest
the guy who shot you?

28:04.290 --> 28:07.920
No, no. I left the police out of it.

28:09.130 --> 28:11.980
It's complicated. I knew the guy.

28:12.650 --> 28:18.220
Anyway, I tell you, that bullet
was like a wakeup call for me, rudy.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.420
It was a correction.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.480
Silver lining, huh?
Lemons into lemonade?

28:23.490 --> 28:26.010
No, I'm serious. Man, that...

28:26.540 --> 28:30.560
- most people out there thought I was a real asshole.
- Yeah?

28:32.040 --> 28:35.180
My wife wouldn't have
anything to do with me.

28:35.190 --> 28:37.770
She filed for divorce.

28:37.780 --> 28:39.570
Took our daughter.

28:39.590 --> 28:43.090
Sent... sent my kid out west someplace.

28:46.480 --> 28:50.270
- Night nurse said she called.
- When?

28:50.280 --> 28:52.410
This morning.

28:53.210 --> 28:55.220
it says she wants to visit.

28:55.230 --> 28:57.540
Fantastic.

28:57.850 --> 29:01.160
Now I got a chance to
put things right with her.

29:01.870 --> 29:05.170
You know, maybe we could start over.

29:08.340 --> 29:10.310
What?

29:11.730 --> 29:14.710
I don't want her to see me like this!

29:14.720 --> 29:16.790
I'm a goddamn cripple!

29:16.820 --> 29:18.520
For christ's sake, I'm pissing myself!

29:18.550 --> 29:21.010
I can't even eat solid food...

29:21.020 --> 29:23.310
Relax. Hey, come on.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.010
You got to calm down, man.

29:30.650 --> 29:32.580
Calm down.

29:32.610 --> 29:35.470
I'm sorry. I'm pathetic.

29:44.250 --> 29:48.700
maybe, I tell you what. Let's
not shave. Let's not shave.

29:48.710 --> 29:50.910
And you know those tubes?

29:50.950 --> 29:52.730
Like, I know, I know I
don't need them anymore,

29:52.760 --> 29:58.160
but maybe when she comes, we
could stick a couple up my nose.

29:59.390 --> 30:02.160
Yeah, let's not shave.

30:13.160 --> 30:15.760
The alarm people called.

30:15.780 --> 30:18.980
They're going to activate
the new system tomorrow.

30:19.250 --> 30:21.450
That's good.

30:24.750 --> 30:27.500
- You have to make a decision, daniel.
- I know.

30:27.510 --> 30:30.970
If that company is making people
sick, you have to stop them.

30:38.990 --> 30:41.560
You think... I'm not grieving?

30:41.920 --> 30:48.870
My concern is that clinging to david's
killer is your way of clinging to david.

30:48.890 --> 30:55.420
The type of violence you experienced
could make a person retreat and collapse,

30:55.450 --> 30:59.770
or be consumed with rage.

31:00.630 --> 31:03.530
Neither one is healthy.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.740
Let me ask you something.

31:07.770 --> 31:11.790
What do you think would
make you feel better?

31:13.490 --> 31:15.300
Seeing david again.

31:15.310 --> 31:16.720
And you know what? Ellen...

31:16.730 --> 31:18.360
That's not going to happen.

31:18.380 --> 31:24.250
Ellen... ellen! Let's talk about this!

31:52.810 --> 31:53.960
Thank you, perry.

31:53.970 --> 31:56.760
Low 70s, lovely night for a walk.

32:07.290 --> 32:09.710
Patty?

32:10.140 --> 32:12.760
I need to talk to you.

32:20.700 --> 32:24.950
I've come because I need your
help, patty. I'm in trouble.

32:25.260 --> 32:29.310
Really? What kind of trouble?

32:31.710 --> 32:34.750
I have information.

32:37.660 --> 32:40.800
And I'm being threatened.

32:42.060 --> 32:47.490
I've come because you know people
who can protect me, discretely.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.390
Daniel...

32:48.410 --> 32:51.210
My family isn't safe.

32:53.650 --> 32:59.390
Patty, my wife... my kid.

33:01.650 --> 33:04.580
The other night, they broke in.

33:05.680 --> 33:08.290
Call the police.

33:09.160 --> 33:13.080
I did. They filed a report.

33:14.870 --> 33:17.330
I feel much safer now.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.100
How is any of this my problem?

33:20.110 --> 33:21.900
Jesus, patty, you
think I want to be here?

33:21.920 --> 33:25.870
You think I enjoy begging you for help?

33:32.250 --> 33:38.220
If I go public with what I know, it
could bring down an industry. Patty...

33:38.230 --> 33:40.630
I don't want anything
to do with you, daniel.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.790
You made that perfectly clear.

33:43.810 --> 33:49.260
I respected your wishes, but
now, goddamn it, I need you.

33:53.170 --> 33:55.930
Too bad.

33:56.530 --> 33:59.290
Don't you turn your back on me.

33:59.300 --> 34:01.120
You owe me.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.360
I owe you nothing.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.659
Another whiskey.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.960
Couple more and you'll have to
change one group for another.

34:28.590 --> 34:30.949
That's funny.

34:31.540 --> 34:33.830
Please leave me alone. I'M...

34:34.580 --> 34:37.239
I'm done with therapy.

34:37.250 --> 34:40.040
You made that clear.

34:40.050 --> 34:43.630
So, you followed me?

34:43.940 --> 34:47.230
Well, it was only 15 blocks.

34:47.650 --> 34:50.690
Yeah, well, I'm not interested.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.950
In what?

35:00.960 --> 35:02.630
In you...

35:02.640 --> 35:06.780
and whatever bullshit
line you're gonna feed me.

35:06.800 --> 35:10.390
The only bullshit I
was gonna feed you is...

35:10.400 --> 35:13.040
you left that on your chair.

35:17.640 --> 35:18.820
Thanks. Thank you.

35:18.830 --> 35:22.240
Well, it was only 15 blocks.

35:27.780 --> 35:30.960
My girlfriend hated whiskey.

35:31.410 --> 35:37.220
Which is ironic because the guy that
ran her over was shit-faced on the stuff.

35:41.030 --> 35:42.990
you have a good night.

35:44.040 --> 35:47.130
- the guy who killed your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

35:48.310 --> 35:52.020
- Do you know where he is?
- Attica.

35:53.080 --> 35:57.280
But with good behavior,
he'll be out march 16, 2011.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.700
You know the date?

35:59.710 --> 36:02.060
It's a wednesday.

36:04.210 --> 36:07.300
I know how you're feeling.

36:18.310 --> 36:23.340
It took me five months
before I could sleep again.

36:25.420 --> 36:28.260
What changed?

36:31.630 --> 36:34.170
I realized something.

36:34.190 --> 36:37.550
People like you and me--
we only have two options.

36:37.560 --> 36:42.230
Got, uh, forgiveness, revenge.

36:44.170 --> 36:46.800
Which did you choose?

36:48.140 --> 36:51.280
Neither... yet.

36:57.020 --> 36:59.940
You take it easy, parsons.

37:27.140 --> 37:30.480
I'm over here, patty.

37:33.200 --> 37:37.370
Oh, quit wallowing. Stop
worrying about all that.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.380
What's done is done.

37:47.500 --> 37:50.060
Come on, patty.

37:50.070 --> 37:52.650
A charity?

37:53.260 --> 37:56.590
Hungry children ain't gonna cut it.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.740
You want to make amends,

37:59.750 --> 38:05.420
start by telling the truth and
confess to ellen what you did to us.

38:05.900 --> 38:08.890
- Patty?
- Yeah?

38:09.890 --> 38:12.420
Is everything okay?

38:12.840 --> 38:15.400
Yeah, just fine.

38:16.700 --> 38:19.740
Actually...

38:20.450 --> 38:22.610
we need to talk.

38:22.620 --> 38:25.570
Sure. Fire away.

38:25.580 --> 38:28.200
Not in the office.

38:28.210 --> 38:30.860
It's, um...

38:31.860 --> 38:34.090
it's personal.

38:34.490 --> 38:35.970
Okay.

38:35.990 --> 38:39.590
If you're not busy
friday after the gala,

38:39.600 --> 38:44.770
there's a little place near the
waldorf I'd love to have a drink.

38:46.400 --> 38:49.240
Look forward to it.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.300
Can you give me the headlines?

38:51.310 --> 38:55.460
It's about you and the frobisher case.

38:58.790 --> 39:02.610
I didn't explain
everything that happened.

39:02.620 --> 39:05.070
Okay.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.600
I want to wear a wire.

39:15.620 --> 39:16.730
This is a big step.

39:16.750 --> 39:19.400
You do this, you become
a cooperating witness.

39:19.410 --> 39:21.130
We can't keep your name confidential.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.130
You'll have to appear in court.

39:23.140 --> 39:24.650
Testify against her.

39:24.670 --> 39:25.860
I'm fine with that.

39:25.880 --> 39:28.370
Ellen, there is no
reason to jump the gun.

39:28.390 --> 39:31.830
She wants to talk to me
about the frobisher case.

39:31.850 --> 39:34.170
You don't want to hear it?

39:34.180 --> 39:37.710
What, uh, what exactly did she say?

39:37.730 --> 39:40.580
She said she didn't explain
everything that happened.

39:40.590 --> 39:42.950
I told you she tried to kill me.

39:42.960 --> 39:45.740
Her guilt is eating at her.

39:45.750 --> 39:48.150
How do you know that?

39:48.160 --> 39:49.960
I can see it.

39:49.970 --> 39:51.660
She's not in a good place.

39:51.670 --> 39:54.700
- When is the meeting?
- Friday after the gala.

39:54.710 --> 39:57.630
- Where?
- A restaurant in midtown.

40:04.740 --> 40:07.000
All right.

40:09.250 --> 40:12.050
It's what we signed you up for.

40:35.500 --> 40:38.410
It's time, mr. Purcell.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.950
You ready to be reasonable?

40:50.970 --> 40:53.260
Did you find anything interesting?

40:53.270 --> 40:55.760
Yeah, very.

40:55.780 --> 40:58.730
At least the parts I could understand.

40:58.740 --> 41:03.760
Purcell was doing some
sort of chemical analysis.

41:04.750 --> 41:08.230
- Get this to our guy at columbia.
- Will do.

41:11.100 --> 41:14.690
Yeah? Thanks. Send him up.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.870
it's sam arsenault.

41:19.280 --> 41:22.070
So, where are you on
the charity foundation?

41:22.080 --> 41:24.210
Nowhere.

41:24.560 --> 41:28.400
Without arsenault's money,
there is no foundation.

41:30.740 --> 41:33.720
Your visit's gonna do
him a world of good.

41:33.730 --> 41:35.340
His painkillers are pretty strong.

41:35.360 --> 41:38.690
But he's going to do just fine.

41:39.130 --> 41:43.180
He'll be happy to see you when
he wakes up, mrs. Frobisher.

42:20.820 --> 42:23.100
Baby.

42:43.910 --> 42:46.450
david!

42:51.050 --> 42:55.130
People like you and me--
we only have two options.

42:55.820 --> 42:59.850
Forgiveness. Revenge.

43:36.010 --> 43:39.760
It's time for his lunch. Mrs. Frobisher,
you could sit with him if you...

43:39.770 --> 43:42.700
mrs. Frobisher?

43:55.090 --> 43:57.960
Mr. Frobisher?

44:00.930 --> 44:03.540
Is she here yet?

44:03.550 --> 44:07.610
So, despite your best efforts,
the da wouldn't drop the charges.

44:07.620 --> 44:08.830
Can you believe it?

44:08.860 --> 44:11.450
If lily's name wasn't arsenault,
this never would've happened.

44:11.470 --> 44:13.020
You're goddamn right.

44:13.040 --> 44:14.350
She was set up.

44:14.370 --> 44:16.080
What happened to your campaign?

44:16.100 --> 44:18.550
It's dead in the water.

44:18.560 --> 44:23.780
Republican chairman sees lily on the news,
dumps me, decides to back another horse.

44:23.810 --> 44:26.010
Oh, sam.

44:28.250 --> 44:30.520
Look, patty, uh...

44:30.530 --> 44:35.070
it's hard for me to ask,
but, um, I want back in.

44:35.780 --> 44:37.220
To my foundation?

44:37.240 --> 44:39.070
I know, it's embarrassing.

44:39.090 --> 44:42.070
I'm standing here with my
pants down around my ankles.

44:42.100 --> 44:45.660
But I've always been a big fan
of the cause, you know that.

44:45.670 --> 44:48.470
And after lily, I could sure use the pr.

44:48.490 --> 44:52.860
We'd be happy to take your money, sam,
but I've promised away the naming rights.

44:52.880 --> 44:56.120
It can't be the
arsenault-hewes foundation?

44:57.980 --> 45:02.620
Patty, I want my name up there.

45:02.630 --> 45:05.180
I wish I could help you.

45:05.200 --> 45:07.770
Come on.

45:10.780 --> 45:14.160
There's gotta be something i could do.

45:14.430 --> 45:18.250
HEWES/ARSENAULT
CHILDREN'S HUNGER INTIATIVE

45:18.260 --> 45:20.740
I will be eternally
grateful to patty hewes.

45:20.750 --> 45:24.660
No, no. Sam is the real hero here.

45:24.670 --> 45:29.020
At the last moment, he generously
decided to double our endowment.

45:29.040 --> 45:33.440
Well, I'm thrilled that I can make a
difference with just the stroke of a pen.

45:34.890 --> 45:36.790
Hey, mom.

45:37.590 --> 45:39.600
Look at that guy.

45:40.030 --> 45:43.540
He's out here celebrating and his
daughter's being sent to juvie.

45:44.330 --> 45:46.570
Such a shame about lily.

45:46.590 --> 45:49.230
I told you she was a cokehead.

45:49.240 --> 45:51.730
Yeah. Yeah, you did.

45:51.740 --> 45:55.260
God help you if I ever find out
you're doing anything like that.

45:55.280 --> 45:59.070
I tried it, mom. Coke's not my thing.

46:00.220 --> 46:02.980
- Patty, congratulations.
- Thank you.

46:02.990 --> 46:05.760
Incredible evening. Oh, it's amazing.

46:06.130 --> 46:07.070
Well...

46:07.090 --> 46:11.120
So now that you've launched
this, uh, maybe we can...

46:11.160 --> 46:12.900
Take a case?

46:12.930 --> 46:14.740
It's just a thought.

46:15.790 --> 46:20.630
I like ellen's infant mortality case.

46:20.640 --> 46:24.430
That is just the kind of cause
that we should be advancing.

46:24.440 --> 46:27.920
Well, then, let's do it.

46:28.220 --> 46:30.420
Set up a meeting with
the plaintiff tomorrow.

46:30.430 --> 46:32.470
Fantastic.

46:33.080 --> 46:36.320
Nice find, ellen. It's a great case.

46:36.330 --> 46:37.860
I'm glad you think so.

46:37.890 --> 46:39.550
Patty.

46:40.050 --> 46:43.620
Daniel, I had no idea
you were here tonight.

46:43.630 --> 46:46.640
An important cause like this,
we didn't want to miss it.

46:46.650 --> 46:49.160
I don't believe you
know my wife christine.

46:49.180 --> 46:51.120
Christine, come say hi!

46:51.130 --> 46:53.470
Uh, will you excuse me?
I really should go say hi.

46:53.480 --> 46:56.930
Um, two minutes and we'll go, okay?

46:57.340 --> 46:59.120
It's really nice to meet you.

46:59.130 --> 47:00.810
I admire your work so much.

47:00.820 --> 47:02.920
Thank you for your support.

47:04.940 --> 47:06.160
She's lovely.

47:06.170 --> 47:09.760
Listen, patty. I'm sorry
about the other night.

47:10.400 --> 47:13.520
I don't want to drag you into this.

47:13.860 --> 47:15.830
I can handle it myself.

47:15.850 --> 47:17.720
Glad to hear it.

47:17.730 --> 47:22.190
I should really get those
materials back from you.

47:22.870 --> 47:25.250
I'll have them messengered
over to your office tomorrow.

47:25.260 --> 47:28.770
Better to send them to my home.

47:28.780 --> 47:31.530
Daniel, come say hello.

47:32.780 --> 47:36.230
I promise you-- you
never have to see me.

47:47.150 --> 47:48.070
Jesus!

47:48.080 --> 47:50.750
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

47:50.760 --> 47:52.630
What, you're stalking me now?

47:52.640 --> 47:55.490
No. You just didn't come back to group.

47:55.500 --> 47:58.090
Yeah, that's kind of what
I had in mind when I quit.

47:58.110 --> 48:00.390
What do you want from me?

48:00.400 --> 48:03.320
I don't want anything.
I... nothing. I don'T...

48:03.980 --> 48:05.470
I was just concerned.

48:05.490 --> 48:09.420
And, and, look, I-I-I
thought this might help you.

48:09.760 --> 48:11.580
What's that?

48:11.610 --> 48:15.200
It's a phone number.
Don't worry; it's not mine.

48:15.210 --> 48:18.610
Call after midnight. Just ask for frank.

48:18.620 --> 48:22.030
But if a woman answers,
you should hang up.

48:22.040 --> 48:23.230
I don't do drugs.

48:23.240 --> 48:25.610
Well, that's good 'cause
he doesn't sell any.

48:25.620 --> 48:27.100
And they're bad for you.

48:27.110 --> 48:29.680
Well, then, what am I calling him for?

48:30.670 --> 48:34.350
Because frank's not the kind of
guy who gets hung up on permits.

48:34.860 --> 48:37.910
A permit? For what?

48:37.920 --> 48:39.770
- A gun.
- A gun?

48:39.780 --> 48:40.860
You know what...

48:40.870 --> 48:43.600
What. what the hell would make
you think that I want a gun?

48:43.940 --> 48:45.570
Because I think you're scared.

48:45.580 --> 48:48.280
Because I think you
feel helpless and alone.

48:48.290 --> 48:50.530
Now, if you tell me I'm
wrong, then I'm wrong.

48:50.550 --> 48:52.810
And I apologize--
my mistake.

48:52.830 --> 48:55.650
I've been thinking about
this whole revenge thing.

48:57.630 --> 48:59.730
Yeah?

49:00.590 --> 49:04.640
It's not me. It's not who I am.

49:08.370 --> 49:13.840
A gun's not gonna help, so i guess I'm
just gonna have to find a way to forgive.

49:23.960 --> 49:28.520
It functions like a normal telephone,
but there's a microphone right here.

49:28.530 --> 49:32.010
To activate it, you just turn it on.

49:32.030 --> 49:33.470
Think I can handle that.

49:33.490 --> 49:37.170
It records in and out of the case,
but out is better if you can manage it.

49:37.190 --> 49:38.520
You don't want to talk too much.

49:38.540 --> 49:41.870
That's the biggest mistake people
make. When they get nervous, they talk.

49:41.880 --> 49:45.110
If patty's gonna give us anything,
we don't want you speaking over her,

49:45.130 --> 49:50.100
so you can prompt her with questions, but
then you got to back off and you let her talk.

49:50.110 --> 49:52.470
- I got it.
- You ready?

49:52.480 --> 49:55.890
I'm fine. You guys are
more nervous than I am.

49:56.730 --> 49:58.640
Okay.

50:01.500 --> 50:02.990
This is agent randall harrison.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.210
The date is june 14.
The time is 11:27 P.M.

50:08.220 --> 50:13.190
Ellen parsons, do you give your voluntary consent
to have this recording device placed on your person?

50:13.200 --> 50:15.510
Yes.

50:31.960 --> 50:35.920
Well, sorry about that. Fox news.

50:36.740 --> 50:40.010
Oh, you... you've got another bottle?

50:40.310 --> 50:41.390
what is it?

50:41.410 --> 50:44.480
Château lafitte... something french.

50:44.490 --> 50:47.770
I just picked the most
expensive one on the list.

50:52.050 --> 50:55.570
so, you wanted to tell me something.

51:00.800 --> 51:07.190
Ellen, I didn't explain everything
to you during the frobisher case.

51:07.680 --> 51:08.840
That's all in the past.

51:08.870 --> 51:13.550
No, no, it's important
that you know this.

51:14.460 --> 51:16.810
Patty, I think we both need to move on.

51:16.820 --> 51:21.690
The frobisher case was chaos,
and we weren't thinking clearly.

51:21.700 --> 51:27.390
Still, I... I want to apologize.

51:28.470 --> 51:32.120
Apologize? Apologize for what?

51:34.150 --> 51:41.160
The weekend after
fiske committed suicide,

51:42.390 --> 51:47.400
his death had a profound effect on me.

51:47.410 --> 51:53.070
It, um, pushed me to a place
that I had never to been before.

51:54.730 --> 51:57.260
I didn't know that.

51:57.540 --> 52:01.930
I... I became too emotional.

52:01.940 --> 52:06.100
I was afraid of being exposed,

52:06.130 --> 52:10.150
of losing the case.

52:10.630 --> 52:13.360
I lost control.

52:13.370 --> 52:15.940
I had to leave the city.

52:17.680 --> 52:21.710
While I'm gone, you're
welcome to stay here.

52:21.720 --> 52:27.470
Ellen... everything's
gonna be all right.

52:34.500 --> 52:37.880
You said you went to visit family.

52:41.260 --> 52:44.290
Well, that wasn't exactly true.

52:49.240 --> 52:51.560
No?

52:52.140 --> 52:56.940
Years ago, I had a child.

53:01.460 --> 53:04.300
I've never told anyone.

53:06.220 --> 53:10.000
The baby, was, um, unhealthy.

53:10.010 --> 53:15.670
The doctors said it was,

53:15.680 --> 53:19.440
stillborn. It was a little girl.

53:23.040 --> 53:25.890
I named her julia.

53:31.090 --> 53:35.730
Sometimes, I think, if she'd lived...

53:38.260 --> 53:41.500
I'd be another person.

53:46.930 --> 53:49.310
So, when you went away, you...

53:49.320 --> 53:52.070
I went to visit her.

53:55.310 --> 54:00.990
I hadn't been to that
cemetery in 30 years.

54:02.870 --> 54:05.890
And while I was there,

54:05.900 --> 54:10.540
someone attacked you in my apartment.

54:22.570 --> 54:25.870
Whoever broke in was looking for me.

54:25.880 --> 54:28.380
It's done.

54:33.380 --> 54:36.650
I wish to god it had been me.

54:39.880 --> 54:45.820
I want you to know that if
my daughter had survived--

54:45.830 --> 54:48.910
if julia
had lived--

54:50.180 --> 54:53.270
I'd want her to be just like you.

55:11.240 --> 55:13.540
How did it go?

55:24.590 --> 55:28.250
Hello? This is she.

55:29.020 --> 55:31.380
I was wrong.

55:31.720 --> 55:33.720
I didn't get anything.

55:33.740 --> 55:35.850
It's just more lies.

55:36.080 --> 55:38.450
What did she say?

55:39.220 --> 55:41.930
She told me someone was
coming to kill her that night

55:41.950 --> 55:45.700
and some bullshit about me
being the daughter she never had.

55:45.720 --> 55:50.710
Well, you're building a
relationship, establishing intimacy.

55:50.720 --> 55:52.990
These things take time.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.770
I don't have time.

56:00.030 --> 56:01.400
- Miss hewes?
- Yes.

56:01.410 --> 56:03.750
- This way, please.
- Thank you.

56:18.090 --> 56:20.470
Patty?

56:42.710 --> 56:45.480
Now will you help me?

56:49.510 --> 56:53.290
The important thing is she
took the infant mortality case.

56:53.300 --> 56:55.290
Where are we on that?

56:55.300 --> 56:58.110
Patty's meeting the
lead plaintiff tomorrow.

56:58.120 --> 57:00.220
Good.

57:01.370 --> 57:03.130
We'll get her, ellen.

57:03.150 --> 57:05.610
How long do these things usually take?

57:05.640 --> 57:09.330
Could be two, three years
before we have enough.

57:09.340 --> 57:11.960
You got to be patient.

57:13.260 --> 57:15.850
Can you do that?

57:21.140 --> 57:24.660
6 MONTHS LATER

57:31.460 --> 57:33.710
So, it's just the two of us.

57:34.900 --> 57:37.520
Face to face.

57:51.770 --> 57:55.560
It seems like you're not gonna
tell me the truth after all.

57:58.070 --> 58:00.740
Well, that's okay.

58:01.640 --> 58:03.880
I lied, too.
