07:14.642 --> 07:17.103
because she's never been
out of her parents' house.

She's so sheltered.

We're going to Newby's.

It's a locals bar,
you'll have a good time.

Everyone goes to Newby's,
that's like my joint.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.286
I know all the bouncers,
I know all the bartenders.

07:33.369 --> 07:34.871
I can't wait to show

and all my friends go to,

07:38.249 --> 07:40.543

taste of PCB.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.246
She brought her damn
fishing rod.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.414
Brought the real thing--

08:18.497 --> 08:19.790
And the ramen!

08:19.874 --> 08:21.459
She brought some
ramen noodles, dude!

08:21.542 --> 08:23.461

08:43.856 --> 08:45.816
But I don't babysit
grown people.

08:45.900 --> 08:51.197
So, if Kortni goes out and makes
a train wreck of herself,

08:51.280 --> 08:52.615
that is not my responsibility.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.368

08:55.451 --> 08:57.411
I have to pee so bad.

08:57.495 --> 08:58.621
Can I try on your glasses?

You wanna try on

get you some Pampers,

15:46.779 --> 15:48.155
or what, what's the deal?

15:48.238 --> 15:49.323
Kortni pee in her bed?

15:49.406 --> 15:50.741
{\an1}Yeah, Kortni peed
all in her bed.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.534
(Codi)
What?! Oh, my God.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.078
How drunk do you have to be
to pee-pee

15:54.161 --> 15:54.870
in somebody else's bed,
and then you're sitting there

15:54.953 --> 15:57.748
laying in the pee-pee bed.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.875
When we left her,
she was in the right bed.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.251
{\an5}Yeah, she literally--

15:59.958 --> 16:01.251
And then when we came back,

16:01.335 --> 16:02.169
{\an5}she was in the left bed.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.169
Okay, that was
(bleep) dumb.

16:02.252 --> 16:04.004
She, like, got up
out of that bed,

16:04.088 --> 16:05.756
{\an5}got into this bed...

16:04.088 --> 16:05.756
And peed and...

16:05.839 --> 16:08.217
{\an1}...took a piss and then
got back in the other bed.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.843
Like, what the hell?
Are you kidding me?

16:09.927 --> 16:11.220
{\an6}Oh, my God.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.220
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.347
I'm definitely starting to learn
a lot of things

16:13.430 --> 16:16.183
I didn't know about Kortni,
now that we're living together.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.560
Our roommates just met her,
so I don't want them to think,

16:18.644 --> 16:19.728
"Oh, Lord, what am I getting
myself into,

16:19.812 --> 16:22.231
these two girls
are wild as hell and crazy,"

16:22.314 --> 16:23.565
just because of Kortni's
actions.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.359
{\an5}(Candace)
Kortni, I know
you a drunk mess,

16:25.442 --> 16:29.238
but I'm not comfortable
sleeping in new people's pee.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.324
I'm not comfortable sleeping
in old people's pee.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.077
So, with that being said,
like, I'm just gonna sleep

16:35.160 --> 16:36.829
in Clark Kent's bed,
shout-out to you.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.747
{\an8}Exactly, unh!

16:38.831 --> 16:40.749
{\an5}Giving it up.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.749
Saving lives every day.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.584
{\an8}Saving lives every day, right?

16:42.668 --> 16:43.585

16:43.669 --> 16:44.128

happened last night?

17:08.569 --> 17:11.780
{\an8}I wasn't just blacked out,
I was blacked the hell out.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.781
{\an1}I can't believe
drunk-ass girl peed

17:13.866 --> 17:15.159
in somebody else's bed.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.243
Like, girl, come on now,
what are you, an animal?

17:17.327 --> 17:19.788
{\an1}Maybe we should get her
a litter box.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.040
(both laugh)

17:22.124 --> 17:23.416
(whispering)
Kortni?

17:23.500 --> 17:26.044
{\an4}(Kortni)
Oh, my God, I'm still
(bleep) drunk, man.

17:26.127 --> 17:27.296
{\an1}I don't even (bleep)
remember coming in here.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.255
{\an1}Listen...

17:28.338 --> 17:29.798
{\an1}they said you peed
your bed last night.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.134
They said you peed her bed.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.802
What?!
No.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.512
I don't pee the bed.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.806
{\an5}(Nilsa)
Is there like a stain
or a spot or anything?

17:37.890 --> 17:38.974
No, there's not.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.142
Oh... is it right there?

17:40.225 --> 17:41.935
This wet spot right here
on the floor?

17:42.019 --> 17:45.147
{\an1}Could be a drink.
Yeah.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.858
It's a drink.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.858
It's a drink.

17:47.941 --> 17:48.942
Some (bleep) hell.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.529
(Kortni)
I did not pee the bed.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.865
I'm being framed!
I'm being freaking framed.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.284
And I will bet money on it.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.835
{\an1}(Codi)
Are we gonna get in the pool?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.963
{\an1}(Aimee)
Hell yes.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.173
{\an1}(Nilsa)
Whoo!

18:11.256 --> 18:12.257
Here we go.
Oh!

18:12.341 --> 18:14.968
{\an4}(Gus)
That was way too close
to my face.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.512
I wanna barbecue tonight.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.055
{\an5}(Nilsa)
We're gonna season these
and put 'em on the grill.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.848
In the South,
you have to barbecue.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.517
{\an8}Barbecue's my favorite
Southern dish.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.768
Now, watch your eyebrows.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.353
{\an5}Oh yeah, that was nice.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.353
There you go.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.022
{\an5}(Nilsa)
So we got the grill going,
we got the beers going.

18:27.105 --> 18:29.024
We got Kortni recovering
from her major hangover.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.901
{\an8}We're good to go.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.402
{\an1}We need everybody
at the table,

18:32.486 --> 18:34.404
{\an1}so bring your ass over here
and sit down, let's go.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.449
{\an5}(Candace)
Bless the hands
that prepared this food.

18:37.533 --> 18:40.285
Bless everyone in this house.
We give you the glory.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.370
(all)
Amen.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.622
Yes, you did good,
you did good.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.915
{\an4}(Gus)
Mm.

18:43.705 --> 18:44.915
(Nilsa)
You did a damn good job.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.917
{\an1}(Kortni)
Yeah, it's good.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.752
{\an3}Ow!

18:48.836 --> 18:50.838
I'm gonna hurt
my lip injections.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.714
I better be careful.

18:52.798 --> 18:54.216
Are you, like,
being for real?

18:54.299 --> 18:56.051
I got fake boobs,
fake eyebrows, fake lips.

18:56.134 --> 18:57.636
Like, I don't care, it's me.

18:57.719 --> 18:58.971
Damn, you fake
all over, ain't you?

18:59.054 --> 19:01.056
I am just fake bitch,
but I'm real as hell

19:01.139 --> 19:02.307
when it comes
to my personality.

19:02.391 --> 19:03.892
{\an1}I heard that,
give me some on that.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.061
{\an4}(Candace)
So, why everybody
here this summer?

19:06.144 --> 19:07.813
{\an1}How 'bout you,
Captain America?

19:07.896 --> 19:09.523
(laughter)

19:09.606 --> 19:11.066
You know, for me,
this is like something

19:11.149 --> 19:12.901
I've never done before.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.862
Like, my parents
homeschooled us all.

19:16.697 --> 19:18.407
{\an5}Hey, I'm not gonna lie,
when I think of
homeschool kids,

19:18.490 --> 19:20.534
{\an5}I think socially awkward,
and like, they're not
gonna talk to anybody.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.369
{\an1}'Cause they don't know what
it's like to be around people,

19:22.452 --> 19:23.954
{\an1}you know, 'cause they've been
in their own little bubble,

19:24.037 --> 19:25.747
like, their whole life,
you know what I mean?

19:25.831 --> 19:29.585
{\an1}For me, my only answer to that
is basically my parents.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.169
{\an1}The main meaning that
they wanted to drive home

19:31.253 --> 19:32.629
with us was family.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.424
{\an5}(Nilsa)
It's kinda hot
that Jeremiah's homeschooled.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.968
He hasn't been tainted by,
like, public school,

19:38.051 --> 19:42.389
or like, college girls,
and... I like that.

19:42.472 --> 19:44.474
{\an4}(Gus)
Well, I came here
this summer to have fun.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.560
{\an1}I've been working my ass off,
I've been going to school.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.186
And, uh, I just
needed a break.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.605
I feel you.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.605
{\an3}You know?

19:49.688 --> 19:52.149
People think I have it easy,
I guess just 'cause...

19:52.232 --> 19:53.984
{\an4}(Candace)
You got blue eyes?

19:52.232 --> 19:53.984
I got blue eyes.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.277
{\an5}(Kortni)
And your hair.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.277
And my hair.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.528
I'm just kinda pretty,
but that's-- it's not the case.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.197
Like, I was homeless there
for a little while.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.616
I got kicked out at 17,

20:00.699 --> 20:02.868
I was living on, like,
my friends' couches there

20:02.951 --> 20:04.119
for literally, like,
a year and a half.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.747
You know, I'm hoping this summer
can just bring me

20:06.830 --> 20:08.123
to new people
and new experiences.

20:08.206 --> 20:09.958
What about you, Nilly?

20:10.042 --> 20:13.295
Um, well... I got married
when I was 20.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.631
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.631
I met a guy that was
in the Marines.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.216
I'm gonna cry.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.216
That's okay.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.054
{\an1}(Kirk)
It's okay.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.513
Anyways, I got married
when I was 20,

20:23.597 --> 20:25.307
and then I, like...

20:25.390 --> 20:27.476
we were in so love,
and he was so good.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.852
He was, like, literally,

20:28.936 --> 20:30.979
I thought he was gonna be
the guy for me forever.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.774
He was amazing,
and my parents loved him.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.984
And then we decided...

20:42.115 --> 20:43.325
(choking up)
I don't wanna go there.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.369
{\an1}(Kortni)
Oh, give me a hug.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.334
The one thing a woman
wants to do in life

20:52.417 --> 20:54.378
is to, like, have a baby.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.338
So, we got pregnant,
and then we--

20:56.421 --> 20:59.800
I lost the baby,
I had a miscarriage.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.843
{\an3}Oh, God.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.387
I can't-- mm-mm,
I can't do it.

21:03.470 --> 21:06.640
{\an5}Got both of you, all right?

21:03.470 --> 21:06.640
{\an1}I can't.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.308
Okay, so I had
a miscarriage.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.519
Okay, it's fine,
it happens.

21:10.602 --> 21:11.853
After the miscarriage,

21:11.937 --> 21:13.563
my husband deployed
a month later,

21:13.647 --> 21:15.983
and I had-- I literally
just had to, like...

21:16.066 --> 21:20.153
get over that myself.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.031
And then after
all that happened,

21:23.115 --> 21:23.865
{\an1}he comes back from deployment
and he cheats on me.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.493
Oh, my God, oh!

21:27.703 --> 21:29.705
The guy I married
just turned out

21:29.788 --> 21:32.541
not to be...
what I thought he was.

21:35.794 --> 21:39.047
{\an1}You wanna know the blessing
in all of this, can I tell you?

21:39.131 --> 21:41.675
{\an1}What if you would have had
a baby by him,

21:41.758 --> 21:43.385
{\an5}and then turned out...

21:41.758 --> 21:43.385
And then here we are?

21:43.468 --> 21:44.219
{\an1}Means that you would have
been in the situation right now

21:44.302 --> 21:46.263
{\an1}without your husband
and alone.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.974
{\an5}That was a blessing.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.974
{\an1}But then, having the baby
would have been a blessing too.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.392
{\an1}I promise you, you're gonna
find you a wonderful man

21:50.475 --> 21:53.020
{\an1}that's gonna appreciate
everything about you,

21:53.103 --> 21:54.396
{\an1}your beautiful face,
your attitude, everything.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.690
{\an1}And then you wanna know
what's gonna happen?

21:56.773 --> 21:58.317
{\an1}You're gonna have
beautiful children by him.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.861
{\an1}Three, four, 500 of 'em,
look, so...

22:00.944 --> 22:04.072
{\an5}(laughter)

22:00.944 --> 22:04.072
{\an3}(Gus)
500?

22:04.156 --> 22:05.407
(Nilsa)
I just thought maybe this was

22:05.490 --> 22:06.908
just gonna be
a crazy-ass summer

22:06.992 --> 22:08.535
where we just get drunk
and party and go crazy.

22:08.618 --> 22:11.496
But I don't think
that's what this is,

22:11.580 --> 22:12.914
I don't think it's what
it's gonna be.

22:12.998 --> 22:15.459
I think in a way, we're all
going through something,

22:15.542 --> 22:17.753
and we're all gonna,
like, help each other

22:17.836 --> 22:20.881
through these dark places
that we're in,

22:20.964 --> 22:22.632
and finally get
a chance to break away

22:22.716 --> 22:24.384
and heal with each other.

22:24.468 --> 22:27.346
That takes a lot
to share that.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.930
Love you, sweetie.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.898
{\an8}Are you peeing?

22:35.520 --> 22:37.898
{\an8}Yes.

{\an7}What do you say we go
to a nice little dinner,

22:39.858 --> 22:40.942
{\an8}just me and you tonight?

{\an7}Get dressed nice,
I'm gonna get dressed nice,

have a good time.

I'm having second thoughts
about this date,

30:25.782 --> 30:28.159
because Gus is taking this
very seriously,

30:28.243 --> 30:29.911
and that's scary.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.746
We literally just moved
in the house together.

30:31.829 --> 30:33.748
It hasn't even been
but three days.

30:33.831 --> 30:36.584
My grandpa's name is Gus,
my dad's name is Gus.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.919
My name's Gus.

30:38.002 --> 30:39.295
So, if we have a kid,
are you okay

30:39.379 --> 30:41.798
with our baby
being named Gus?

30:41.881 --> 30:43.883
{\an3}(laughs)

30:45.176 --> 30:47.971
♪♪

30:50.807 --> 30:53.726
Take your shot, and I have
a proposition for you.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.353
Don't look at me like that.

30:55.436 --> 30:57.272
{\an4}So, I need to take the shot
first and then listen to you?

30:55.436 --> 30:57.272
{\an3}Yeah.

30:57.355 --> 30:58.690
{\an1}Or do I need to listen
to you and then take it?

30:58.773 --> 30:59.899
You need to take it.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.150
That way,
my douchebaggery

31:01.234 --> 31:03.111
is like muddled
through the vodka.

31:05.947 --> 31:06.781
I was wondering
if you wanted to accompany

31:06.864 --> 31:09.117
on a date tomorrow night.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.119
Yes, accompany.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.119
{\an1}Where?

31:11.202 --> 31:13.454
I don't know yet,
I had to first figure out

31:13.538 --> 31:14.372
if you were interested
or not.

31:14.455 --> 31:16.457
{\an1}Sure, I'll go
on a date with you.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.084
You're sure, yeah?

31:18.167 --> 31:20.503
{\an8}You know, I've never been asked
if somebody wants to just--

31:20.587 --> 31:23.256
{\an8}"Hey, like, you wanna go
on a date?"

31:23.339 --> 31:24.299
{\an8}Is this like
charity or...

31:23.339 --> 31:24.299
{\an7}No.

31:24.382 --> 31:28.428
You just act like
it's... (laughing)

31:28.511 --> 31:31.681
I heard, like,
"You wanna go get some food?"

31:31.764 --> 31:32.849
Yeah, bruh, let's go.

31:32.932 --> 31:36.936
Like, free food?
I mean, are you paying?

31:37.020 --> 31:38.938
{\an1}Are you trying
to give me a hug?

31:39.022 --> 31:40.356
{\an1}Oh, I thought
you were like...

31:40.440 --> 31:42.150
{\an1}I was like,
what are you doing?

31:42.233 --> 31:44.861
(laughter)

31:44.944 --> 31:46.279
{\an4}(Nilsa)
What were you gonna do
if somebody else

31:46.362 --> 31:47.488
asked me on a date?

31:47.572 --> 31:48.948
I wouldn't have
let it happen.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.241
If I see something I want,
I'm gonna go and get it.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.994
I think I'm probably
gonna lean in for a kiss

31:53.077 --> 31:54.287
before the end of the night.

31:54.370 --> 31:56.664
I have never been rejected
a kiss, ever.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.667
So, hopefully tonight
is not the first time.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.085
Let's say...
Jeremiah asked you

32:01.169 --> 32:03.671
on a date first.
I would have stepped in.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.006
"I know while
you're on that date,

32:05.089 --> 32:06.215
"you're gonna be thinking
about me anyway,

32:06.299 --> 32:07.383
{\an1}so you might as well just
change it and come with me."

32:07.467 --> 32:09.510
{\an1}Oh, baby.
Oh, baby.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.346
Dude, really?

32:11.429 --> 32:15.183
So, what's-his-name,
Jeremiah, he's literally--

32:15.266 --> 32:16.643
you weren't down there
for that conversation.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.354
He's taking Kortni
out on a date, right?

32:19.437 --> 32:21.689
{\an1}He is?

32:19.437 --> 32:21.689
Yeah, tomorrow.

32:21.773 --> 32:25.109
Kortni... no.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.695
Is he into her?

32:27.779 --> 32:30.198
{\an3}I think so.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.866
I don't know if he's like,
into her, into her,

32:31.949 --> 32:33.868
or if he just
wants a booty call,

32:33.951 --> 32:35.536
but he's
definitely intrigued

32:35.620 --> 32:38.164
by the whole situation
that is Kortni.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.333
{\an1}He likes the loud,
obnoxious girl?

32:40.416 --> 32:42.043
Yeah!
(laughs)

32:42.126 --> 32:45.171
{\an1}Damn, I didn't take him
to be that type.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.465
Kortni can go on a date
with Jeremiah all day long.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.008
But at the end of the day,
if I want Jeremiah,

32:49.092 --> 32:50.760
I will have Jeremiah.

32:50.843 --> 32:52.220
Kortni's no competition
for me.

32:52.303 --> 32:53.763
Am I doing all right?

32:52.303 --> 32:53.763
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

32:53.846 --> 32:55.807
{\an3}Yeah?

32:53.846 --> 32:55.807
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

32:55.890 --> 32:57.058
I'm sharing my cheesecake,
is that not enough?

32:57.141 --> 32:58.142
That should be-- that
should show right there.

33:00.937 --> 33:02.772
{\an5}You do not waste--
where did that go?

33:00.937 --> 33:02.772
{\an1}Do not!

33:02.855 --> 33:05.149
Don't even.
Don't even!

33:05.233 --> 33:07.902
I really wanna eat it.
Can I please eat it?

33:07.985 --> 33:09.404
Yes, if you-- if it means
that much to you, do it.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.906
{\an5}Are you still gonna--

33:09.487 --> 33:11.906
{\an1}Go for what
your heart desires.

33:11.989 --> 33:13.199
Will you still kiss me
by the end of the night

33:13.282 --> 33:14.534
if I eat this off the floor?

33:14.617 --> 33:15.201
{\an1}I'm not kissing you
at the end of this date.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.915
{\an5}(Nilsa)
I feel like Gus thinks
he can get whatever he wants.

33:20.998 --> 33:23.167
But I'm not down
with that, no.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.085
I don't have any, like,
cheesecake residue

33:24.168 --> 33:26.212
in my hair
or anything, do I?

33:26.295 --> 33:28.089
Nope, I think you're good.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.841
You gotta get
real close to look.

33:32.009 --> 33:33.553
{\an3}(laughs)

33:32.009 --> 33:33.553
Okay, we're good.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.556
Oh, it was worth a try.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.141
Check, please.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.774
{\an1}(Nilsa)
Honey, we're home!

33:46.858 --> 33:48.109
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
Where are the cute
little lovebirds?

33:48.192 --> 33:51.070
About to go get out
of this monkey suit.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.947
{\an5}(Gus)
At this point,
I'm kinda pissed off.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.574
Like, she said yes to going
on the date with me,

33:54.657 --> 33:55.867
but yet she still wants
to give me a cold shoulder.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.034
{\an1}(Jeremiah)
Where's Guster?

33:57.118 --> 33:59.871
{\an1}Guster, you all right
over there, buddy?

33:59.954 --> 34:01.414
I got some things
to figure out.

34:01.497 --> 34:02.081
{\an1}I think he's, like,
really into me,

34:02.165 --> 34:04.000
and I'm just not there.

34:04.083 --> 34:05.793
Like, I'm into him, yes...

34:05.877 --> 34:06.961
{\an5}(Candace)
What'd I say?

34:05.877 --> 34:06.961
{\an1}(Aimee)
Hold on, I said that.

34:07.044 --> 34:08.963
{\an5}Would I go on
a second date?

34:07.044 --> 34:08.963
I said that.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.090
{\an5}I said that.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.090
Maybe like a lunch date.

34:11.174 --> 34:14.135
Do you feel like
you're more into Jer?

34:14.217 --> 34:14.969
I like Hercules because
he's not chasing me

34:15.052 --> 34:17.513
like Gus has been chasing me.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.098
(Nilsa)
I'm only 23, but I feel like

34:19.181 --> 34:21.100
because I was married,
I did lose out

34:21.184 --> 34:23.686
on some of the best years,
like college.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.605
So, I need to, like,
be a 23-year-old.

34:25.688 --> 34:26.981
I need to have fun,
I need to go wild,

34:27.065 --> 34:28.190
I need to go crazy, I need
to hook up,

34:28.274 --> 34:29.859
I need to drink, I need
to pass out on the beach,

34:29.942 --> 34:31.068
I need to show my boobs.

34:31.152 --> 34:34.362
I'm excited to finally
get to live for Nilsa.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.782
Boobies.

34:35.864 --> 34:36.699
The thing is, he's getting
so irritated with me

34:36.783 --> 34:38.993
because I'm not like...

34:39.076 --> 34:40.828
He's used to girls being like,
"Oh my God, Gus,

34:40.911 --> 34:42.538
your beautiful hair,"
and da-da-da-da.

34:42.621 --> 34:45.123
And that's fine.
but that's not me.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.458
The date went good
and everything,

34:46.542 --> 34:49.879
but, bro, I dropped
$150 on that dinner.

34:49.962 --> 34:52.422
{\an4}(Jeremiah)
Wait, how much?

34:49.962 --> 34:52.422
{\an3}$150.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.051
He dropped a buck-50
on the dinner.

34:55.134 --> 34:59.180
I'm like,
no, what are you doing?

34:59.263 --> 35:00.848
Don't laugh, dude,
my wallet is hurting.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.225
My heart's hurting.

35:02.308 --> 35:05.728
I did get a piece
of cheesecake though.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.438
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Coming up...

35:07.522 --> 35:09.065
{\an8}So, we'll see
what he does.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.608
{\an7}(Gus)
Oh, God.

35:10.691 --> 35:13.653
{\an8}I'm going to sneak
into Jeremiah's bed tonight

35:13.736 --> 35:16.989
{\an8}and see how things go.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.033
{\an8}(Gus)
Y'all have fun.

35:19.116 --> 35:20.409
{\an8}Don't be making all them
giraffe noises though

35:20.493 --> 35:22.078
{\an8}when I'm sleeping
in the bed next to y'all.

35:23.871 --> 35:26.415
♪♪

35:31.254 --> 35:33.172
(Kortni)
I'm like, so out of it.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.382
My mind is just like...
Dddttt!

35:34.465 --> 35:36.592
{\an1}There's basically--
there's just nothing going on

35:36.676 --> 35:37.718
in your head, basically.

35:37.802 --> 35:39.262
Nothing, like,
I don't even...

35:39.345 --> 35:40.596
{\an4}(Jeremiah)
No, she's just--

35:39.345 --> 35:40.596
I can't even think.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.099
{\an5}Yeah, because you're
too focused on the date,
that's why.

35:43.182 --> 35:45.893
(sarcastically)
Oh, yeah!

35:45.977 --> 35:47.895
That's better.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.895
{\an3}Totally.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.231
{\an1}(mocking)
Totally.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.483
{\an8}I feel like there's a lot
more to Kortni.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.152
That's why I'm really excited
about this date.

35:55.236 --> 35:57.738
You know, I'm getting to get
to know her a little bit deeper,

35:57.822 --> 35:58.322
{\an8}and actually become
a better friend.

36:00.950 --> 36:02.952
{\an8}(sighing)
Oh, God.

36:03.035 --> 36:04.579
{\an8}I'm excited to go on a date
with Jeremiah.

36:04.662 --> 36:08.541
{\an8}Jeremiah is man-candy, A.F.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.543
{\an4}(Codi)
Oh, yeah.

36:08.624 --> 36:10.543
(Gus)
My boy! My boy!

36:10.626 --> 36:12.920
{\an5}Are you ready for this?

36:10.626 --> 36:12.920
Look at him, look at him!

36:13.004 --> 36:15.423
Looking slick.

36:15.506 --> 36:16.924

Jeremiah looks like
a four-year-old on Easter

36:17.008 --> 36:20.261
with suspenders and glasses.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.805
{\an5}Later, guys.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.805
{\an1}(Codi)
Y'all have fun.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.530
What the hell's
a "cog-nack"?

36:39.614 --> 36:40.948
{\an1}A cognac?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.116
Oh, is that
what it's called?

36:42.199 --> 36:43.576
{\an3}(laughing)

36:43.659 --> 36:45.119
{\an1}Sweet mercy.
(chuckles)

36:45.202 --> 36:46.579
(Jeremiah)
We're at Mikato now.

36:46.662 --> 36:49.999
All I know is I look good
and she looks good.

36:50.082 --> 36:51.417
She's got a nice
little black dress on.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.462
Oh, my God, she's a tall drink
of water, what can I say?

36:54.545 --> 36:56.547
{\an1}So naturally, you know,
I asked you out

36:56.631 --> 36:57.465
because I was curious
about you, you know,

36:57.548 --> 36:59.467
{\an1}getting to know you
and everything.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.803
{\an1}But as far as, like,
initial reactions, you know,

37:02.887 --> 37:05.473
{\an1}you're... wild as (bleep),
like...

37:05.556 --> 37:08.976
First night was crazy,
I'm like, this girl...

37:09.060 --> 37:10.311
Oh, my God, y'all
were probably like,

37:10.394 --> 37:12.230
{\an5}"Let me just kill her."

37:10.394 --> 37:12.230
"She's a hot mess.

37:12.313 --> 37:14.357
{\an1}She's a hot mess."
But in the end,

37:14.440 --> 37:17.234
{\an1}there's always a little fun
that comes with that.

37:17.318 --> 37:20.279
You'll never get bored,
like, (bleep).

37:20.363 --> 37:22.239
{\an5}True that, true that.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.239
Yeah, (bleep), yeah.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.867
{\an1}And also, you know, you're not
that hard to look at, so...

37:24.951 --> 37:26.035
{\an3}Thanks.

37:26.118 --> 37:30.164
Jeremiah makes me blush.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.501
Like, I'm blushing right now.
(laughing)

37:33.584 --> 37:35.836
I can't...

37:35.920 --> 37:38.214
I don't have the fake
eyelashes, but...

37:38.297 --> 37:40.591
{\an1}Oh, God, don't get me
started with that.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.428
Fire in the hole.

37:43.052 --> 37:44.428
{\an1}Yeah!

37:44.512 --> 37:47.348
Ready, beautiful?
Man, you got it right!

37:47.431 --> 37:50.685
High five, yeah,
high five, yeah!

37:50.768 --> 37:52.645
Overall,
this date's pretty fun.

37:52.728 --> 37:54.105
I bet you won't eat it.

37:54.188 --> 37:55.272
{\an5}How much you wanna bet?

37:54.188 --> 37:55.272
{\an3}Ten bucks.

37:55.356 --> 37:57.441
{\an1}Can I dip it
in spicy mayo first?

37:57.525 --> 37:58.818
{\an3}No.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.818
{\an1}No?

37:58.901 --> 38:01.195
Straight up.
Ohh!

38:01.278 --> 38:02.571
{\an3}(laughing)

38:02.655 --> 38:06.033
But in the end, me and Kortni,
it's more like we're bros.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.202
Give me my ten dollars.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.537
And that's fine.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.788
{\an3}You won.

38:10.871 --> 38:13.666
Oh, thank you.

38:13.749 --> 38:17.044
I'm all about the bet.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

38:17.128 --> 38:18.546
{\an4}For you.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.546
Thank you, ma'am.

38:18.629 --> 38:19.839
{\an1}Thank you.

38:19.922 --> 38:21.674
We're splitting that.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.050
{\an3}Hmm?

38:23.134 --> 38:25.428
Did I stutter?

38:23.134 --> 38:25.428
{\an3}(laughs)

38:25.511 --> 38:28.931
I don't know
if there's chemistry

38:29.015 --> 38:30.391
in between me and Jeremiah.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.894
I'm still a little iffy...
but it could go somewhere.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.856
{\an4}I feel like we were
a little bit smart
with our money tonight.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.196
♪♪

38:59.170 --> 39:01.964
{\an7}Whose?

38:59.170 --> 39:01.964
{\an9}Jeremiah's.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.799
{\an4}You're just gonna
lay in the bed?

39:02.048 --> 39:03.799
{\an3}Yeah.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.217
{\an1}Roll with it,
he ain't gonna kick you out.

39:05.301 --> 39:06.802
{\an6}Think so?

39:05.301 --> 39:06.802
{\an1}Yeah, he ain't
gonna kick you out.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.387
{\an6}Okay, yeah.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.387
{\an1}Don't be making all
them giraffe noises though

39:08.471 --> 39:11.182
{\an1}when I'm sleeping in the bed
next to y'all.

39:11.265 --> 39:12.683
(Kortni)
I come up with this great plan

39:12.767 --> 39:16.187
{\an8}that I'm going to sneak
into Jeremiah's bed tonight

39:16.270 --> 39:20.232
{\an8}and see how things go.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.443
We'll see what he does.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.045
(water running)

39:41.128 --> 39:42.546
Wassup, dude?

39:42.630 --> 39:44.965
{\an5}(Gus)
What up, dude?

39:42.630 --> 39:44.965
{\an1}Wassup up?

39:45.049 --> 39:47.176
Hey, did you take
a peek in your bed?

39:47.259 --> 39:48.511
{\an1}What?

39:48.594 --> 39:50.387
You take a peek
in your bed yet?

39:50.471 --> 39:53.057
{\an1}No.

39:53.140 --> 39:54.433
{\an1}(chuckles)

39:54.517 --> 39:55.935
The (bleep) you guys
put in my bed?

39:56.018 --> 39:57.478
{\an1}I didn't put
anything in your bed.

39:57.561 --> 40:00.022
{\an1}You do have a present
in there though.

40:02.817 --> 40:05.444
(Gus laughing)

40:05.528 --> 40:08.197
It's a big old giraffe.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.032
Y'all have fun.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.540
{\an8}(Bleep) damn,
these women are insane.

40:17.623 --> 40:19.583
{\an8}This giraffe's in my bed.

40:23.379 --> 40:26.674
{\an5}You're good.

40:23.379 --> 40:26.674
Oh yeah, I'm good?

40:26.757 --> 40:27.341
You're good.

40:26.757 --> 40:27.341
{\an3}(laughs)

40:27.424 --> 40:30.177
You gonna be all right.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.054
I'm not sure what to do
in this scenario.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.098
She's already
pissed the bed once.

40:34.181 --> 40:37.017
I hope we don't wake up
with a wet stain.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.602
(laughs)

40:38.978 --> 40:42.022
{\an9}Oh, God.

40:45.109 --> 40:47.862
{\an8}♪♪

40:55.870 --> 40:57.705
{\an8}(Nilsa)
Kortni, right when
she gets home,

40:57.788 --> 40:59.248
{\an8}literally the first thing
she does

40:59.331 --> 41:02.460
{\an8}is go into Jeremiah's bed,
and lays down and goes to sleep.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.337
{\an8}I don't give two (bleep)
about that.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.047
{\an8}We're friends or whatever,

41:07.131 --> 41:09.842
{\an8}but if Kortni and I are feeling
the same guy,

41:09.925 --> 41:12.052
{\an8}honey, there's no competition.
Here I am.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.597
{\an8}Game on, bitch.

41:18.475 --> 41:21.061
{\an8}(Candace)
Next time on MTV
"Floribama Shore..."

41:21.145 --> 41:23.606
{\an8}(Nilsa)
I just saw
Jeremiah's wing-a-ding.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.900
{\an8}I'm not disappointed
in what I seen.

41:25.983 --> 41:26.650
{\an8}(chuckles)

41:26.734 --> 41:28.068
{\an8}Knock-knock.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.068
{\an8}Who's there?

41:28.152 --> 41:31.405
{\an9}My vagina.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.615
{\an8}I'm watching you, bitch.
You want some of this?

41:32.698 --> 41:34.992
{\an8}You hit me,
you'll regret it.

41:35.075 --> 41:36.202
{\an7}I will knock
your teeth out, bitch.

41:36.285 --> 41:38.204
{\an8}(girl shrieks)
