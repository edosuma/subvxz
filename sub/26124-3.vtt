WEBVTT

00:18.430 --> 00:20.227
You sure you want to bring all that?

00:20.310 --> 00:22.130
They lose the bags sometimes,
you know.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.801
Yeah, well,
that's why you gotta be prepared.

00:25.520 --> 00:26.760
Okay, Daddy.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.646
Yo, you think I need this coat?

00:28.940 --> 00:30.601
It's gonna be warm in LA.

00:30.690 --> 00:32.646
What about inside the plane?
Is it cold?

00:33.280 --> 00:34.349
You've never flown before?

00:35.070 --> 00:37.197
Never had the occasion till now.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.407
Why would I want to be all crammed up
in a tin can for four hours?

00:41.500 --> 00:44.071
- It's seven hours.
- Seven?

00:44.170 --> 00:46.707
- Yeah.
- Let me see the tickets.

00:49.710 --> 00:52.213
See? We land at 1:00.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.464
Yeah, and we leave at 9:00.
Four hours.

00:56.550 --> 00:57.926
No, there's a time change.

00:58.010 --> 00:59.921
We go back in time?

01:00.010 --> 01:03.969
- I don't play that shit.
- No, it's a different time zone.

01:05.020 --> 01:08.899
Yeah, I knew that.
You think I'm ignorant?

01:10.110 --> 01:12.988
- Are you nervous about flying?
- Me?

01:13.900 --> 01:15.231
Hell, no.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.730
It's not dangerous.

01:17.070 --> 01:19.698
Only, like,
a few planes go down every year.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.406
Anyway, we should get going.

01:22.910 --> 01:27.119
Hold up. Gotta think on this.

01:27.210 --> 01:28.620
Think on what? The awards are tonight.

01:28.710 --> 01:31.497
Yeah, but if we all crashed up
in the Nebraska cornfields,

01:31.590 --> 01:34.297
then ain't nobody winning nothing
but Best Burnt-to-Shit Motherfuckers.

01:34.380 --> 01:35.790
Don't be crazy.

01:42.350 --> 01:43.385
Fuckit

01:43.640 --> 01:45.688
- We're staying.
- What?

01:45.770 --> 01:49.308
Yeah. You're too valuable an asset.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.970
Harvey can get your award,

01:51.070 --> 01:53.607
or send some Injun bitch
up there like Marlon Brando did.

01:53.690 --> 01:55.988
CC, I have to go.

01:56.070 --> 01:57.947
You know I have to go.

02:36.570 --> 02:38.561
Bring back that gold for us.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.986
You know I will, Daddy.

04:35.810 --> 04:38.608
No, no, don't give me that look.
Just hear me out.

04:38.690 --> 04:41.739
You remember how you felt
when you first got the Hi-Hat, right?

04:41.820 --> 04:44.232
Hell, I remember how you felt.
I saw you, I was there.

04:44.860 --> 04:46.487
Yeah, it was a nice opportunity.

04:47.410 --> 04:49.981
Come on. You loved it.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.247
Yeah, I loved it.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.958
That's all we're asking for,
an opportunity.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.700
$20,000.

04:58.170 --> 04:59.489
We don't need the whole amount.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.955
I've got seven in cash.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.757
You kick in the rest,
we can secure the lease.

05:04.340 --> 05:07.423
Yeah, personally,
it sounds like a great idea.

05:07.510 --> 05:08.886
We have to see what Rudy says.

05:09.140 --> 05:10.926
Yeah, about that.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.511
We want to do this on our own.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.767
- With my money.
- It's a promissory note.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.351
You're gonna get paid back
with interest.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.180
And Rudy still gets his nut
on the original bar,

05:20.270 --> 05:23.023
but this new one, it's ours.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.571
You know,
I thought you were the smart one.

05:38.210 --> 05:41.589
- Okay.
- Yes! Thank you, man. Thank you.

05:41.670 --> 05:44.628
- I fucking love you.
- All right. All right.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.671
Get a shot of Kelly's ass,
would ya?

05:54.060 --> 05:56.096
And, cut.

05:56.350 --> 05:57.476
Very nice.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.437
Darlene, Kelly, you're done.

05:59.690 --> 06:01.396
Jennifer, stick around.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.357
Let's set up the camera for the DP.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.562
You heard him, let's go.
DP's up, you guys.

06:08.660 --> 06:12.699
"DP." That's
"Director of Photography," right?

06:12.790 --> 06:14.030
Head cameraman?

06:14.120 --> 06:16.577
Nah. DP means "double penetration."

06:16.710 --> 06:19.167
Double penetration?

06:19.250 --> 06:21.377
So, you fuck her twice?

06:21.460 --> 06:23.246
Not exactly. 50...

06:23.340 --> 06:25.410
- He's talented.
- Who, Eric?

06:25.510 --> 06:26.795
He got you going, huh?

06:26.880 --> 06:30.179
No. I mean, he's a trained actor.

06:30.260 --> 06:32.171
I saw him in a toothpaste commercial.

06:35.730 --> 06:39.348
- He does have a nice smile.
- Nice tongue, too.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.438
Your paychecks cleared.
Great scene. Very hot.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.027
Thank you, Carrie.

06:56.290 --> 06:58.076
You have another scene
coming up later?

06:58.660 --> 06:59.911
No. Why?

07:00.540 --> 07:02.121
Just thought I saw it in the script.

07:02.210 --> 07:03.950
You read the whole script?

07:04.840 --> 07:08.583
So, your dick touches his dick?

07:08.670 --> 07:12.788
Not on purpose, but if it happens,
who cares?

07:12.890 --> 07:15.176
- That shit is fucked up.
- Drew, we're ready for you.

07:15.260 --> 07:18.673
Personally, I'm into it.

07:20.560 --> 07:24.189
The high crime rate
continues to deter visitors.

07:24.270 --> 07:28.104
But law enforcement is only
one piece of a coordinated effort

07:28.190 --> 07:31.774
with zoning reform,
and sustained economic development.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.487
What the fuck does this
have to do with us?

07:33.570 --> 07:34.571
- No fucking clue.
- Nothing.

07:36.740 --> 07:39.038
Our overall action plan
comprises a series

07:39.120 --> 07:41.953
of immediate, intermediate,
and long-term goals.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.450
For instance, in the short term,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.662
we are supporting legislation
to prevent "hot bedding,"

07:47.800 --> 07:51.008
renting the same hotel room
more than twice in 24 hours.

07:51.090 --> 07:52.717
- That's never done.
- Right.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.880
Good luck.

07:53.970 --> 07:56.928
We're proposing a permanent
city-wide ban on massage parlors,

07:57.390 --> 08:01.599
and we will more closely regulate
the distribution of collateral

08:01.690 --> 08:03.760
promoting sex-related businesses.

08:05.730 --> 08:09.279
A tourist or city resident should
be able to walk through Times Square

08:09.360 --> 08:12.488
without being constantly
propositioned with handbills.

08:12.570 --> 08:13.810
I'm sorry. "Hand" what?

08:14.910 --> 08:16.650
- Handbills?
- Oh, hand bills.

08:16.740 --> 08:18.401
Okay.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.366
The Broadway Theater District

08:23.460 --> 08:27.203
has seen revenue growth
of over 100% in the last four years.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.450
_ I shouldn't have
given up dance lessons.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.756
You might have been good at that.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.966
The Manhattan Plaza Housing Project

08:32.050 --> 08:35.793
has added 1,700 residential units
to the neighborhood,

08:35.890 --> 08:38.552
with 70% occupied
by performing artists.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.709
And the city has plans

08:39.810 --> 08:42.688
for a new convention center
on 11th Avenue

08:42.770 --> 08:45.011
that will provide a southwest anchor.

08:48.650 --> 08:50.641
- What's wrong?
- Sorry, Gene, it's stuck.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.276
- Damn it.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

08:53.990 --> 08:55.230
It's the damn budget cuts.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.902
- What happened?
- I don't know. It just stopped.

08:57.990 --> 08:59.321
All right,
so, you want us to come back?

08:59.410 --> 09:01.617
- I'll be right with you.
- Maybe it's overheated.

09:01.700 --> 09:05.033
There's 16 parlors now,
between 7th and 10th.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.998
You can't take a piss
on 42nd Street without hitting one.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.660
Are we still making money here?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.377
Yeah, but we won't for long.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.416
I sent Black Frankie
over to one of the new places

09:13.510 --> 09:15.080
last night, with a $10 bill,

09:15.180 --> 09:17.421
he got a hand job
and came back with change.

09:17.510 --> 09:20.468
- What, you didn't tip?
- Seven-fifty. It was all right.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.802
Seven-fifty?
How the fuck are they making a profit?

09:23.890 --> 09:26.723
They ain't.
They're just trying to put us under.

09:26.850 --> 09:28.477
It's what you call a loss leader.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.642
Yeah, but here's the thing. Tell him.

09:30.730 --> 09:33.028
Wasn't no fuzz on that peach.

09:33.110 --> 09:35.772
- What, high school girls?
- More like junior high.

09:35.860 --> 09:37.612
Fucking Hodas is out of control.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.487
His people may be scumbags,
but even they don't go for this shit.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.616
Rudy, are you ready to come up?

09:42.700 --> 09:44.748
Yes, sweetheart.

09:46.870 --> 09:50.374
You boys hold the line.
No slashing prices.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.008
I'll get with Carmine over this.

09:55.550 --> 09:58.838
Rudy. One more thing.

09:58.930 --> 09:59.965
What, you gonna join me, Vince?

10:00.050 --> 10:01.347
'Cause believe me,
I don't need your help.

10:02.270 --> 10:07.390
Uh, it's about Paul. He wants
to open another night spot.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.263
- What, another fag joint?
- It's more like a supper club.

10:11.610 --> 10:16.309
Piano player, top-shelf liquor,
dining room, good menu.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.699
- It's in a townhouse.
- An upscale jomt, huh?

10:19.780 --> 10:21.862
That's not a bad idea.
How much does he need?

10:22.490 --> 10:23.616
He doesn't need anything.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.361
Then why are we
having this conversation?

10:26.210 --> 10:29.498
Look, Paul's very grateful
for what you did for him,

10:29.580 --> 10:31.207
he doesn't mean any disrespect,

10:31.290 --> 10:33.838
he just wants his own thing,
free and clear.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.751
Free and clear?

10:39.010 --> 10:41.547
So, Paul invokes my name
to shake the Horse,

10:41.640 --> 10:43.710
and now,
he wants to fly away from the nest?

10:45.100 --> 10:46.977
You got a hand in this bullshit?

10:48.940 --> 10:52.057
Yeah. I'm staking him a few grand.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.141
Just a loan to get him off the ground.

10:54.230 --> 10:56.812
Figured he deserved it.
He's done good for us.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.577
All right.
I'll get him in line, all right?

11:02.700 --> 11:03.940
No.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.530
No, it's all right.

11:08.830 --> 11:12.414
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.252
Now, can I go get
my fucking rocks off already?

11:17.340 --> 11:19.080
It's rude to keep a lady waiting.

11:23.600 --> 11:26.637
Every four years,
another action plan.

11:26.850 --> 11:30.138
Another bunch of suits getting paid
to write reports and make pie charts.

11:30.230 --> 11:31.936
How many times
have we seen this movie?

11:32.020 --> 11:36.059
Urban renewal is_a reliable formula.
Plays well With the voters.

11:36.150 --> 11:37.390
Well, it may play well with voters,

11:37.490 --> 11:39.560
but it doesn't play
in a room full of cops.

11:39.650 --> 11:41.277
We're catching dead bodies
most nights of the week,

11:41.360 --> 11:43.237
and he's talking about
box office receipts

11:43.320 --> 11:44.776
for.
Ann/e
and .
A Chorus L/ne.

11:46.870 --> 11:50.078
Cut Goldman a little slack.
He's a policy guy.

11:50.160 --> 11:51.912
They tend to lack social skills.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.588
I'm not sure about the policy, either.

11:54.670 --> 11:57.912
Koch was pitching the idea of
a combat zone during the campaign.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.466
What the hell happened then?

11:59.550 --> 12:02.462
The red-light district?
No, that's dead.

12:02.550 --> 12:06.008
They don't want it moved anymore,
they want it gone. You know why?

12:07.100 --> 12:09.136
Somebody in Public Morals got morals?

12:09.230 --> 12:12.131
'Cause every block in Midtown
that's occupied by cash businesses

12:12.230 --> 12:14.016
that don't report their actual income

12:14.110 --> 12:16.931
_is a million dollars
In lost tax revenue.

12:17.020 --> 12:19.181
It's not morals, it's money.

12:21.570 --> 12:24.198
_Don't underestimate
this group of do-gooders.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.941
the minute they stepped
out of law school.

12:29.330 --> 12:32.151
These Midtown enforcement people
are idealists,

12:32.500 --> 12:36.038
and we might be
shuffling people around as a result.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.239
Sir?

12:38.340 --> 12:40.706
I'm not so sure Officer Handbills

12:40.800 --> 12:43.792
is the best kind of person
for Vice Squad in the Koch era.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.926
I could put your name out there
if you're interested.

12:51.350 --> 12:53.978
I spent years trying
to get out of that cesspool.

12:54.310 --> 12:57.939
So, no thank you.
I'm happy where I am.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.292
If the Rangers manage
to limp into the playoffs,

14:47.380 --> 14:48.836
who would you want in the net?

14:48.930 --> 14:50.215
Thomas or Davidson?

14:51.350 --> 14:53.341
What the fuck do I know
from hockey, man?

14:53.430 --> 14:55.591
I'm from West Baltimore.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.759
Evening, ladies.

14:56.850 --> 14:57.885
Hey, Bobby.

14:57.980 --> 15:01.893
Hey, Marilys.
Big night for you ahead.

15:02.570 --> 15:04.140
I'm late for work!

15:04.230 --> 15:05.436
You don't need this shit.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.771
You shouldn't be working here
with all these fucking creeps.

15:07.860 --> 15:09.407
It's my job.

15:09.490 --> 15:10.525
And I do need this shit,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.771
because I got a kid back home
that needs Pampers.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.280
You gonna support me, Danny?

15:14.370 --> 15:16.110
Anita, I ain't fucking around here.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.202
Flanagan, she's clocking in.

15:18.290 --> 15:21.999
This ain't your
fucking business, Bobby.

15:22.080 --> 15:24.799
It is my business
if you're hassling my employees.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.869
Watch it, man.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.508
I make the right phone call,
and the rent goes up.

15:29.970 --> 15:34.714
Can we leave the soap opera
out on the sidewalk? Please?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.436
Only because you said "please."

15:42.190 --> 15:43.896
Come on, let's go. Come on.

15:46.400 --> 15:50.143
You sinners will go to hell!
You sinners will go to hell!

15:50.320 --> 15:52.197
You sinners will go to hell!

15:52.280 --> 15:54.407
You sinners will go to hell!

15:56.160 --> 15:59.402
Hey, Beclq! Move away! Move away!

16:04.750 --> 16:06.627
Sorry. Excuse me.

16:06.710 --> 16:08.416
Sweetheart! Right here!

16:14.930 --> 16:18.172
- Shana! Shana!
- Over here!

16:22.980 --> 16:25.642
- Hey.
- Hey!

16:25.730 --> 16:28.107
- It's our Best Supporting Actress.
- Nominee.

16:28.190 --> 16:31.193
- Excited?
- I'm very excited.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.772
- Where's your man?
- Oh, C.C. decided not to come.

16:34.870 --> 16:36.770
No kidding.
I thought he'd want to be here

16:36.870 --> 16:39.657
to shake down Dave Friedman
and the entire AFAA board

16:39.750 --> 16:42.207
for 50 bucks
and an extra shrimp cocktail.

16:42.290 --> 16:44.781
Turns out he doesn't like airplanes.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.452
"Fear of Flying"? That's appropriate.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.199
It's a book.

16:51.590 --> 16:53.831
Now listen, after the ceremony,
you make sure

16:53.930 --> 16:56.137
you schmooze those money guys
we're after, all right?

16:56.220 --> 16:59.769
Harold Lime,
Nathan Malone, Bill Osco...

16:59.850 --> 17:01.386
That's the plan.

17:01.480 --> 17:04.267
The thing is, most people
think of prostitutes as a cancer,

17:04.350 --> 17:05.760
and with all the police harassment,

17:05.850 --> 17:07.898
a lot of the women
think of themselves that way, too.

17:07.980 --> 17:10.562
Okay, but we've had outraged people
for a while, now.

17:10.650 --> 17:13.778
I mean, what's happening
on the West Coast that's different?

17:13.860 --> 17:15.987
Okay, it started with outrage,
and that was cool,

17:16.070 --> 17:18.368
but what it led to out there
was organizmg.

17:18.450 --> 17:20.406
You make relationships
with these women,

17:20.490 --> 17:23.618
and it opens a door
to something bigger.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.666
The goal is decriminalization.

17:25.750 --> 17:28.241
And meantime, we help however we can.

17:28.340 --> 17:30.661
Medical services, free legal aid.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.712
Even just making them feel
like they're not alone out there

17:33.800 --> 17:35.620
makes a difference.

17:36.470 --> 17:40.383
That's what Arlene Carmen was doing
when she got arrested in January.

17:40.470 --> 17:41.630
I read about that.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.632
"Loitering for purposes
of prostitution."

17:44.730 --> 17:47.392
Dave's working with
the NYCLU on her lawsuit.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.300
That's why he came out east with us.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.976
How are you arguing it?

17:51.110 --> 17:53.021
The law is unconstitutional.

17:53.110 --> 17:55.567
Violates the Fourth
and Fourteenth Amendments.

17:55.780 --> 17:58.817
- And Arlene's right back out there.
- Do you wanna meet her?

17:58.910 --> 18:00.400
She's taking the van out tonight.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.532
- I could meet you after I close up.
- Sure.

18:05.620 --> 18:09.875
No boys allowed, but I'll tell Arlene
that the two of you are in.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.541
Don't forget to bundle up.

18:11.630 --> 18:13.837
- Bye, Dave.
- Bye.

18:24.140 --> 18:25.266
You okay?

18:25.350 --> 18:26.385
Mmm-hmm.

18:29.350 --> 18:30.681
Is C.C. still around?

18:32.690 --> 18:33.896
Yeah.

18:41.070 --> 18:44.619
BobbyAstyr,
for
Barbara Broadcast.

18:44.700 --> 18:48.113
- Who are you?
- I’m Harvey the Wal/banger.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.246
Can you believe how much money's here?

18:52.340 --> 18:54.956
How much money do these people have
to spend on these outfits?

18:55.050 --> 18:57.120
I mean, how can they afford it?

18:57.220 --> 18:58.619
Guess you were gelz‘lhg o/o’.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.966
What the hell?

19:00.050 --> 19:03.383
I mean, they're not showing
any of the good stuff.

19:03.470 --> 19:06.519
- Come on, look at these clips.
- No titties?

19:06.600 --> 19:08.682
No titties, no twats, no fucking.

19:08.770 --> 19:10.647
What, did we walk into
the wrong banquet hall?

19:10.730 --> 19:13.107
I saw more cock in the men's room.

19:13.190 --> 19:16.068
It’s 5177/ a business
doing pleasure with you.

19:18.860 --> 19:23.194
Yeah, yeah, sure, he can act,
but the real talent

19:23.280 --> 19:25.908
is keeping your dick hard
for 14 hours.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.036
Huh?

19:27.120 --> 19:30.669
No! We should be saluting
Jamie Gillis' helmeted soldier!

19:30.750 --> 19:31.956
Yeah, what if his parents are here?

19:32.040 --> 19:33.587
Think they want to see his cock
up on the screen?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.159
I'm saying we...

19:35.300 --> 19:38.417
Hey. I'm saying we don't need to be
embarrassed by what we do.

19:39.010 --> 19:41.126
We should be proud of our perversions.

19:41.510 --> 19:44.001
r07
Baby Face.

19:51.810 --> 19:54.438
I read he got paralyzed
from the waist down.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.852
Know what I mean?
Like, no fire down below.

19:56.940 --> 19:58.988
All because of
some dirty fucking pictures.

19:59.070 --> 20:00.731
And now, he's like...

20:00.820 --> 20:03.812
I get it, Frankie. It's a tragedy.

20:03.910 --> 20:05.775
He's luclq he fucking survived.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.321
He probably wishes he didn't.

20:08.410 --> 20:09.820
Don't believe the heathens, Vince.

20:09.910 --> 20:12.322
There is a God,
and he's a twisted fuck.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.456
- Know whatI mean?
- Amen.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.871
Fellas!

20:15.960 --> 20:18.167
Hey, George. You want some Metaxa?

20:18.260 --> 20:21.468
- I don't want no fucking drink.
- Okay.

20:21.550 --> 20:23.927
You see that fuck
in the blue jacket?

20:24.850 --> 20:27.557
- Yeah.
- He's undercutting me.

20:28.220 --> 20:32.008
- Does he kick back to you like I do?
- I don't even know him.

20:33.980 --> 20:35.390
You don't know him.

20:36.150 --> 20:37.890
Then we have a fucking problem.

20:37.980 --> 20:41.063
All right, relax. I'll handle it.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.521
Mike! Mike!

20:46.830 --> 20:48.695
Time to enforce the house rules.

20:48.790 --> 20:49.939
VVhoa!

20:50.040 --> 20:53.203
Death Wish I]
over here.
The sequel.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.258
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:00.800 --> 21:04.258
- You ready?
- Yeah. Let's do it.

21:07.430 --> 21:10.012
Nice to meet you. I'm Abby.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.932
- Excuse me, my man.
- Hey, brother.

21:18.020 --> 21:20.727
- You looking to cop?
- You're outta here.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.310
What are you talking about?

21:22.530 --> 21:26.159
Talking about you peddling your shit
in another man's establishment.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.275
Take it outside.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.656
What about that sheep fucker?

21:30.740 --> 21:33.117
He has an arrangement. You don't.

21:35.170 --> 21:38.992
I paid for this beer.
I'm gonna finish it.

21:42.130 --> 21:43.916
You wanna dance? Huh?

21:45.930 --> 21:48.546
Get off me! Come on, man!

21:49.430 --> 21:51.807
Ah, hey! Ow!

22:02.530 --> 22:04.816
It’s a parody of
Westwor/o;

22:04.900 --> 22:09.360
except instead of cowboys and Indians,
it's sex robots.

22:09.450 --> 22:12.408
I mean, it is brilliant.

22:12.490 --> 22:15.323
I also really loved...

22:19.880 --> 22:21.791
I read the script...

22:21.880 --> 22:24.713
Hey. Is that somebody?

22:24.800 --> 22:27.621
It's Jackie Gayle.
He was on
Merv Grifﬁn.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.540
He opened for Sinatra in Vegas, too.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.387
- You know him?
- Met him a few times.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.227
You're Lori Madison.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.978
- You ’re nominated for
Fam/iy Head?
- Mmm-hmm. That's the one.

22:39.060 --> 22:42.223
I actually thought you were better
in
$t/7/JustA Gir/.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.483
That scene where you're
recovering from amnesia

22:45.570 --> 22:47.197
with all those competing emotions?

22:47.280 --> 22:50.443
I went to Theater of Arts for years
and I can't pull that off.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.908
- What's your method?
- Well, for that,

22:53.990 --> 22:55.070
I just thought about

22:55.160 --> 22:57.151
when I used to sleep
at my grandparents' house,

22:57.250 --> 22:59.571
and when I'd wake up,
I'd sort of know where I was,

22:59.670 --> 23:01.626
but at the same time,
I'd also sort of not know where I was,

23:01.710 --> 23:05.202
so, it was like familiar, but also,
not familiar at the same time.

23:05.300 --> 23:09.373
- Does that make sense?
- Yeah, it does. It's a great scene.

23:11.550 --> 23:13.006
What'd you say your name was again?

23:13.100 --> 23:14.499
Greg Taylor.

23:15.810 --> 23:16.879
So you're an actor.

23:16.980 --> 23:20.518
I've done some acting, yeah,
but now, I'm mostly a talent scout.

23:20.770 --> 23:24.103
If you ever think about moving to LA,
you should look me up.

23:25.150 --> 23:27.562
As great as you are,
you belong out west.

23:27.780 --> 23:29.645
It's happening, right here.

23:29.740 --> 23:32.447
And the winner is Lori Madison!

23:32.530 --> 23:33.940
Okay, I think you're up.

23:34.030 --> 23:35.907
Shit!

23:35.990 --> 23:37.036
Go get it!

23:37.120 --> 23:39.657
For God is sake, you ’re my father!

23:42.170 --> 23:43.489
Yeah, she is!

23:43.590 --> 23:45.581
Yes, yes, yes!

23:49.260 --> 23:51.421
That's how we do it
in New York City, baby!

23:54.810 --> 23:57.096
We had the health center,
but then we realized...

23:57.180 --> 23:59.228
That most of the women
can't come to you.

23:59.310 --> 24:02.518
If we really wanted to reach them,
we needed to meet them where they are.

24:03.270 --> 24:05.226
Do you help them get out of the life?

24:05.320 --> 24:08.608
We would if they asked,
but most of them don't.

24:08.820 --> 24:11.653
We're not out here
trying to save souls.

24:11.740 --> 24:13.526
Their souls don't need saving.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.442
When they locked you up, did they
at least let you order off a menu?

24:18.540 --> 24:21.577
No. All I got was a bologna sandwich.

24:24.210 --> 24:26.280
- Maria.
- Hey.

24:26.380 --> 24:28.917
Jessie. Come in.
Have a seat and get warm.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.410
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:31.510 --> 24:33.137
- Hey, Arlene.
- Hi.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.347
Teabag.

24:40.430 --> 24:42.557
- There you go.
- Thanks.

24:44.860 --> 24:47.010
I got a new picture for the board.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.395
Is that your Donald?

24:52.490 --> 24:55.653
He's in foster care right now,
but I'm gonna get him back.

24:55.740 --> 24:57.526
- That's right.
- He's really cute.

24:57.620 --> 24:59.736
Looks like his daddy.

24:59.830 --> 25:01.991
Yeah. Same eyes.

25:02.080 --> 25:04.241
- Same attitude, too.
- Yeah.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.677
J/i/ Scott for...

25:14.760 --> 25:16.796
Isn't she so beautiful?

25:17.050 --> 25:18.597
You deserve it.

25:19.850 --> 25:21.215
You really mean that?

25:21.310 --> 25:23.301
Yeah, I do.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.852
And, here it comes.

25:29.440 --> 25:34.605
Harvey l/l/asserman
for
Touch in the Night.

25:35.610 --> 25:38.522
I want you to know if I,
by some stroke of luck,

25:38.620 --> 25:40.736
win this fucking thing,

25:40.830 --> 25:42.946
you have a big piece of it.

25:44.330 --> 25:47.629
I just shot that one scene.

25:47.710 --> 25:51.339
It made the movie. It's true.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.789
And the winner is...

25:57.050 --> 25:58.290
Harvey l/l/asserman.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.926
Touch in the Night.

26:03.310 --> 26:04.800
Fuck me sideways.

26:05.270 --> 26:07.761
Whoo! Go get 'em, pervert.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.652
I’m too fuC/(Ing drunk to be up here.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.075
l/l/ow. Thank you very much!

26:28.170 --> 26:31.128
Thatis too kind!
Thank you, thank you. Holy shit!

26:38.300 --> 26:40.131
Oh, shit.

26:40.390 --> 26:42.756
Beware the Ides of March.

26:42.890 --> 26:45.017
This about the guy that tripped
and fell down the stairs?

26:45.640 --> 26:47.096
I don't even_know
what you're talking about.

26:47.190 --> 26:49.977
I'm just here because it's time
for Public Morals to pay you a visit.

26:50.060 --> 26:54.349
- Is 1:00 pm. tomorrow good for you?
- Yeah, that'll work.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.606
We'll take our piece, too.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.698
- Make it pretty.
- Sure.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.782
The Ides of March was yesterday.

27:05.870 --> 27:08.361
Uncultured motherfucker.

27:09.210 --> 27:12.873
Come on, Harvey.
Put on your boogie shoes.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.918
I, uh... I have two left feet
and zero rhythm.

27:16.010 --> 27:17.625
- You should ask my wife.
- I did ask her.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.928
She said if you're too cheap
to fly her out, then I'm your date.

27:21.010 --> 27:23.251
- She said that?
- So, get out here.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.887
It's not just a fantasy,
it's a combination.

27:25.970 --> 27:27.221
I get it.
You don't have to convince me.

27:27.310 --> 27:29.096
- I love the idea.
- Yeah.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.397
The fairy tale aspect will resonate.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.641
But you can't make it for 40K.

27:33.730 --> 27:37.484
I mean,
Missionary to the Moon
was what, 200K? Three?

27:37.610 --> 27:41.273
Approximately. I just...
You can't raise that much back east?

27:41.820 --> 27:46.610
Yeah, but it's all mob money.
I want it to be aboveboard, all of it.

27:46.700 --> 27:49.077
- I want to do it with you!
- Yeah.

27:49.790 --> 27:52.497
I can't scrape that much
together for you.

27:52.580 --> 27:55.162
But you might have a shot
with someone who connects to a studio.

27:55.670 --> 27:56.876
Really?

27:56.960 --> 27:58.916
You get in touch
with Alexander Pullman

27:59.010 --> 28:00.250
at Falconhead Productions.

28:00.550 --> 28:03.849
It's a small shop,
but Alex used to be at Warner's.

28:03.930 --> 28:05.591
Tell him Nate Malone sent ya.

28:05.970 --> 28:07.267
I bet he bites.

28:07.350 --> 28:11.229
Alex Pullman. Thanks, Nate.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.826
- Thanks, Arlene.
- Yeah, thanks.

28:27.910 --> 28:30.242
Good to see you.

28:30.330 --> 28:31.706
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.002
I like to introduce myself
to any new faces.

28:39.090 --> 28:41.547
- You're welcome to join me.
- Sure.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.919
You coming?

28:49.890 --> 28:53.803
Too cold out there for me.
Guess I'm used to California.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.686
Okay.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.201
Hi, Betty!

29:33.690 --> 29:36.477
- Got something for ya.
- What?

29:36.560 --> 29:38.187
You'll see.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.937
- Yummy.
- Uh-huh.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.485
- How's that?
- It's good.

29:49.620 --> 29:52.942
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's very nice. Thank you.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.917
I got a house
by the beach in Santa Monica.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.048
You're gonna love it.

30:03.170 --> 30:05.877
Actually, I have
a really nice hotel room nearby

30:05.970 --> 30:07.039
with a really nice view.

30:07.140 --> 30:08.630
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.301
I'm in.

30:13.520 --> 30:17.479
Baseball made h/m
its first $100, 000 player.

30:17.560 --> 30:18.686
Hey, Daddy.

30:18.770 --> 30:21.568
- For 50 points, name that player.
- Joe DiMaggio.

30:21.650 --> 30:24.357
Joe DiMaggio.
Jolt/n ’ Joe. . .

30:31.740 --> 30:33.321
So, she win?

30:38.080 --> 30:39.456
Don't know.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.911
She didn't call you last night?

30:43.920 --> 30:46.081
Pager can't take long distance calls.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.669
Huh.

30:51.010 --> 30:52.250
"Huh" what?

30:52.850 --> 30:55.171
Ijust... I didn't know
that pagers couldn't take

30:55.270 --> 30:57.636
long distance calls, that's all.

30:58.100 --> 31:00.933
Yeah, well, it's no matter to you,

31:01.020 --> 31:03.978
because your busted-ass face
ain't never leaving this town.

31:09.490 --> 31:10.946
Jesus, C.C.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.459
. Lots of folks are interested
/n ask/ng, ”Whats your s/gn?”

31:28.130 --> 31:30.212
This is the best they could find?

31:30.300 --> 31:32.211
You wanted to be in Times Square.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.926
Did you hear something?

31:49.400 --> 31:50.810
Hello?

31:51.660 --> 31:54.481
What the fuck? You set me up?

31:58.410 --> 32:02.870
Thanks a million, asshole.
He was a regular.

32:06.710 --> 32:08.120
Well...

32:10.680 --> 32:12.170
It's a start.

32:12.430 --> 32:17.174
I am telling you, those white girls
are getting $50 more per day.

32:18.850 --> 32:21.387
Jennifer, she do that other thing,
you know?

32:21.480 --> 32:22.686
Kelly didn't.

32:22.770 --> 32:24.761
She got $200,
we were in the same scene.

32:24.860 --> 32:25.849
That ain't right, Larry.

32:25.940 --> 32:28.602
You gonna have to say
something to Bernie about it.

32:28.690 --> 32:31.193
All right. I got you.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.770
I got you.

32:33.870 --> 32:36.191
If you don't want to get into it
with Bernie, I'll do it.

32:36.280 --> 32:37.486
I can do that.

32:39.750 --> 32:44.699
I ain't_ scared of Bernie Wolf.
All right? I said I got you.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.836
I'm gonna hit him up
for that money that he owes,

32:46.920 --> 32:48.456
soon as we hit the set.

32:48.550 --> 32:51.462
I promise. Go ahead.

32:58.890 --> 33:02.098
Come on, Chocolatey.
What the fuck is this shit?

33:04.060 --> 33:05.800
Detective Alston.

33:05.900 --> 33:10.189
What, are we celebrating that
you finally lost your cherry, negro?

33:10.320 --> 33:11.309
Sit the fuck down, Rodney.

33:11.900 --> 33:12.889
You trying to get us cuffed?

33:12.990 --> 33:14.855
That's my boy right there.

33:14.950 --> 33:17.020
- You look beautiful.
- He coming, y'all.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.155
Who coming where, now?

33:20.410 --> 33:22.150
Surprise!

33:24.710 --> 33:27.122
- Hey, Leon! Welcome back!
- Welcome home!

33:28.500 --> 33:30.752
Fuck that murderous motherfucker!

33:30.840 --> 33:32.626
He's a tall motherfucker.

33:34.970 --> 33:36.426
Smells good.

33:43.140 --> 33:44.550
What looks good, Darlene?

33:44.640 --> 33:46.096
You're not gonna eat your cake?

33:46.520 --> 33:48.351
Leon ain't hungry.

33:48.440 --> 33:50.681
Two over easy, scrapple, right?

33:50.780 --> 33:54.568
- Yes.
- Got that coming right up for you.

33:55.740 --> 33:59.232
So, Nathan tells me you want
to do a literary adaptation?

33:59.330 --> 34:01.537
Yeah, that's the idea.

34:01.620 --> 34:03.531
Have you
secured the rights? Because...

34:04.290 --> 34:06.451
Public domain.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.781
So it's a classic,
//ke
Alice in Wonderland.

34:08.920 --> 34:10.547
Exactly.

34:10.630 --> 34:14.214
If you want to do something like that,
I might be able to get behind it.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.086
And we want to do two versions.

34:16.180 --> 34:18.171
We want to cut a couple of shots
here and there,

34:18.260 --> 34:20.421
and put it out as an R,
just l/ke Fox did with
Alice.

34:21.390 --> 34:23.267
Yeah. What story?

34:24.140 --> 34:25.801
Little Red Rimng Hood.

34:26.140 --> 34:27.550
- That's not bad.
- Yeah.

34:27.650 --> 34:29.436
You could practically bring
the whole family.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.140
Don't take this the wrong way,

34:34.240 --> 34:37.698
but you're probably a little too old
to play Little Red.

34:37.780 --> 34:39.941
So, I'm guessing the grandmother?

34:40.030 --> 34:41.657
No! I'm the director!

34:41.950 --> 34:43.406
Actress/director, right?

34:43.490 --> 34:46.493
No. Behind the camera, that's all.

34:46.580 --> 34:47.865
Candy, this is a business.

34:48.330 --> 34:50.958
People aren't buying tickets
to see the director's credit.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.831
So, you're saying what?

34:52.960 --> 34:53.949
I'm an investor,

34:54.050 --> 34:56.211
I have to be smart about
where I put my money.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.426
So?

34:57.510 --> 35:01.799
So, what, you're not gonna
pony up unless I fuck on film?

35:02.470 --> 35:04.210
Well, I haven't seen
your recent stuff,

35:04.310 --> 35:05.766
but I'm sure you still look great.

35:10.480 --> 35:14.894
Tell you what.
I'll write you a check for 10 grand,

35:14.980 --> 35:18.199
and 10% of the action, right now,

35:18.530 --> 35:22.239
if you come over here
and suck my cock while I'm doing it.

35:41.930 --> 35:43.090
Yeah.

36:15.290 --> 36:17.508
- That's all I need.
- Okay.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.921
- Let me know when you open.
- We will.

36:29.770 --> 36:31.931
Thanks again.

36:35.820 --> 36:36.889
Ours.

36:42.570 --> 36:44.060
Ours.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.902
Hey, this isn't that kind of place.

36:46.990 --> 36:49.743
- Oh, I'm sorry. I...
- Yeah.

36:49.830 --> 36:51.570
- I didn't realize.
- Uh-huh.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.461
I'll be right back.

37:36.330 --> 37:39.333
You fellas have a license to operate?

37:39.420 --> 37:40.751
Oh, no, we don't, Officer.

37:41.710 --> 37:46.465
Well, then, unfortunately I'm gonna
have to confiscate this alcohol.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.382
Here's your summons, Vince.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.767
You pay the fine,
and the marshal here will come back

37:52.850 --> 37:54.590
and remove the padlock.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.339
You'll be open for business tonight.

37:56.560 --> 37:58.471
Thank you very much, Officer.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.778
Hey, Vince, you messed up.

38:00.860 --> 38:02.896
Looks like there's almost
a whole shot left in this one.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.987
All right, make it look good.
One or two crates.

38:10.490 --> 38:13.948
- It's after 3:00 already?
- It's like 1:30.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.702
- What the hell you doing home?
- I got suspended.

38:19.540 --> 38:21.997
Good. You're alive.

38:23.170 --> 38:25.718
So, did he tell you what happened?

38:25.800 --> 38:28.086
Not completely. Suspended for what?

38:28.930 --> 38:30.215
Tell him.

38:30.300 --> 38:33.098
I got into a fight
with Mr. Linzano in gym.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.011
- What do you mean, fight?
- Like a fight.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.840
Like, he shoved me
because I was fighting this other kid,

38:36.940 --> 38:38.840
- so, I shoved him back.
- Shoved who back?

38:38.940 --> 38:40.476
- I said him.
- Which him?

38:40.560 --> 38:42.778
- You're talking two fights!
- The teacher.

38:43.230 --> 38:46.313
- And?
- And I broke his glasses.

38:47.990 --> 38:50.197
I'm getting dressed, taking you back.
You're gonna apologize.

38:50.280 --> 38:53.113
I'm suspended, okay?
Just let me be suspended.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.189
I hate that hole.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.781
Every day I go in there,
I come back home dumber.

38:56.870 --> 38:59.031
School is school. _ _
You're not supposed to like it.

39:09.300 --> 39:11.757
When was the last time you spent
more than 10 minutes with him?

39:12.300 --> 39:13.756
Just you and him?

39:14.810 --> 39:18.723
Been kinda busy, I guess,
keeping a fucking roof over our heads.

39:21.310 --> 39:23.813
Bernie.
Let me holler at you for a second.

39:23.900 --> 39:26.232
Larry Brown. What's shaking?

39:26.320 --> 39:30.529
Say a guy wants
to get into something like this here.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.367
The first thing I'd say is,
that guy needs to be white.

39:33.910 --> 39:35.650
What the hell? Bernie.

39:35.750 --> 39:38.617
You know what 90% of casting is?
Looking the part.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.878
Not a lot of parts
for someone who looks like you.

39:40.960 --> 39:43.121
Come on, man. Give a brother a chance.

39:43.210 --> 39:44.495
Let me lay it out for you.

39:44.960 --> 39:48.009
White guys are
the major consumers of porn,

39:48.090 --> 39:50.297
and they don't want to see
a black guy's cock.

39:50.550 --> 39:53.178
Makes 'em feel insecure. You dig?

39:53.260 --> 39:56.343
Half these girls, they wouldn't fuck
a black guy on a dare.

39:56.430 --> 39:59.479
Interracial tarnishes their brand.

40:00.100 --> 40:01.931
You saying these bitches is racist?

40:02.480 --> 40:06.189
It's not racism, it's economics.
There's no market for it.

40:06.820 --> 40:08.185
Tell you what.

40:08.280 --> 40:09.269
If Johnnie Keyes drops dead

40:09.360 --> 40:11.692
during one of his 45-minute
marathon screws,

40:12.360 --> 40:14.612
you're my first call.

40:19.910 --> 40:22.208
- You asked him?
- Asked him what?

40:23.080 --> 40:24.206
About the money.

40:25.630 --> 40:28.667
- Yeah, I asked him.
- And?

40:29.220 --> 40:32.041
The motherfucker's too cheap
to pay what he owes.

40:35.260 --> 40:39.173
So, this is gonna be your last flight.
We're done here.

40:44.650 --> 40:47.187
God damn it, Frankie!

40:47.270 --> 40:50.239
Vincent's in here every week
asking about the count.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.526
Tommy, too!

40:51.610 --> 40:53.851
You really want Rudy to come
knocking on the door next?

40:53.950 --> 40:56.362
'Cause the guy after Rudy's
not gonna be knocking at all.

40:56.450 --> 40:59.283
Relax. I practically
invented this place.

40:59.750 --> 41:03.288
- Oh, you invented jerking off?
- In a manner of speaking, yes.

41:03.370 --> 41:06.032
You didn't invent shit!
Go put it back in the office.

41:06.130 --> 41:08.621
Hey, just tell my little brother
I'm gonna parlay today's take

41:08.710 --> 41:10.041
into a fucking jackpot.

41:10.130 --> 41:11.415
All right?

41:13.680 --> 41:16.592
Shay, how you making it?

41:16.680 --> 41:19.137
I'm right as rain.

41:19.270 --> 41:22.762
How about we get you
a cup of coffee before you clock in?

41:22.850 --> 41:24.260
Coffee makes me edgy.

41:24.350 --> 41:27.353
Sanka, then.
They say it's better for you, anyway.

41:27.440 --> 41:29.101
I'm cool.

41:29.860 --> 41:33.239
Hey, hey. Hey. I gotcha.

41:33.320 --> 41:37.689
- Someone should fix that.
- Yeah. I'll make a call.

41:46.170 --> 41:49.708
Darlene, you're supposed
to be aroused, not asleep.

41:49.800 --> 41:51.620
Why are we having sex on a plane

41:51.710 --> 41:53.541
with all these people around,
and nobody even notice?

41:53.630 --> 41:55.837
It's a comedy, Darlene.
Doesn't have to make sense.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.751
Well, I can't get into it
if it doesn't make sense.

41:59.310 --> 42:01.096
All right. You're 30,000 feet up,

42:01.180 --> 42:04.479
he's a diplomat, it's thrilling,
you're excited...

42:04.560 --> 42:06.801
Maybe we should talk
about my motivation.

42:06.900 --> 42:07.969
I'm losing altitude, Bernie.

42:08.940 --> 42:10.350
All right, cut!

42:10.440 --> 42:14.979
Everybody grab a cup of coffee,
do something, relax...

42:16.240 --> 42:17.616
What the hell, Darlene?

42:17.700 --> 42:20.191
- You spoke to Larry, right?
- Yeah, I did.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.861
And you still ain't gonna pay?

42:21.950 --> 42:23.656
What? Carrie didn't pay you yesterday?

42:23.750 --> 42:24.899
Didn't pay enough.

42:25.000 --> 42:29.414
I want to know why I don't rate
$200 a day like Kelly and Jennifer.

42:29.540 --> 42:30.837
Damn straight.

42:30.920 --> 42:32.660
- That shit ain't right.
- No.

42:32.760 --> 42:34.375
Right's paying what something's worth.

42:34.470 --> 42:37.291
And I already told your man here,
you're the wrong part of the Oreo.

42:43.180 --> 42:45.512
Blow it out of your ass, Bernie.

42:49.560 --> 42:53.314
That's right.
We're done with this shit.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.027
- Bernie.
- Come on!

42:55.110 --> 42:57.522
I still need the penetration shot!

42:57.610 --> 43:00.272
Seven-fifty for a handjob.

43:00.410 --> 43:03.322
And the girls are, what,
13, 14 years old?

43:03.410 --> 43:06.994
I mean, that sick fuck,
he's got no sense of decency.

43:07.120 --> 43:10.169
Is this true? Is he using kids?

43:10.250 --> 43:12.491
It's not like he keeps
birth certificates on file.

43:12.590 --> 43:15.206
- Who the fuck knows?
- Find out.

43:19.760 --> 43:22.342
Hodas is King of the Peeps.
I don't dispute that.

43:22.430 --> 43:24.887
He could make a castle out of quarters
for all I care.

43:24.970 --> 43:27.097
But he should stay the fuck out
of the parlor business.

43:27.980 --> 43:29.550
I admit I made a mistake

43:29.650 --> 43:31.936
approaching your swish
down in the Village.

43:32.020 --> 43:34.147
And I regret sending
those Puerto Rican animals

43:34.230 --> 43:36.278
down to hassle his clientele.

43:36.360 --> 43:40.148
But as I told the kid,
once I realized he was with you,

43:40.240 --> 43:41.229
I left him alone.

43:42.160 --> 43:46.073
Now, we all agree that
the Village is open territory. Yes?

43:47.660 --> 43:48.649
Sure.

43:48.750 --> 43:51.207
I'm a man of good faith.
What's yours is yours.

43:51.290 --> 43:53.121
You're goddamn right it is.

43:53.210 --> 43:56.168
So, where the fuck do you come off
telling me who owns Midtown?

43:56.260 --> 44:00.082
We all came to an agreement years ago
that the Deuce is open for business.

44:00.340 --> 44:02.501
And if you're not making
any money in your parlors,

44:02.590 --> 44:05.718
then open up a stationery store
and sell fucking pencils.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.766
I could give a shit.

44:09.270 --> 44:12.762
I'll have someone talk to _Hodas
about the underage girls.

44:16.110 --> 44:17.099
That's it?

44:18.360 --> 44:21.238
Thank you for bringing that
to my attention.

45:04.320 --> 45:07.403
Hello, Miss Merre/l,
it’s Diane Rosenthal.

45:07.490 --> 45:09.617
We ’re gonna need proof
of a steady income

45:09.700 --> 45:12.077
before going any fu/ther
with a loan application.

45:12.160 --> 45:14.913
Can you bring copies
of your most recent pa ystubs

45:15.000 --> 45:16.661
to the bank somet/me next week?

45:16.750 --> 45:20.459
Please call me, so we can
arrange a t/me. Bye-bye.

45:22.840 --> 45:25.582
Hey, there.
Hope you got home okay.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.807
I’m at the ofﬁce,
going through my Rolodex,

45:27.890 --> 45:31.474
and I got a couple names
you can hit up here in town,

45:31.560 --> 45:33.346
guys I went to ﬁlm school with,

45:33.440 --> 45:35.510
might get you a little closer
to what you need.

45:35.600 --> 45:40.526
Just to be clear, you know,
I ’rn st/l/ not hem/77g, all right?

45:41.240 --> 45:43.891
This thing is your baby.
I 7! see you soon.

45:45.280 --> 45:48.943
E/leen, it’s Mom.
We need to talk about Adam.

45:49.030 --> 45:51.533
Call me when you get this message.

46:20.860 --> 46:22.145
Ooh.

46:22.610 --> 46:23.736
Check.

46:25.900 --> 46:27.731
It's your move, oh, Danny boy.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.325
I raise.

46:38.500 --> 46:39.740
With what?

46:47.840 --> 46:49.250
With this.

46:53.770 --> 46:55.260
Okay, then.

46:58.810 --> 47:00.050
The fuck?

47:00.150 --> 47:02.516
It's the key to a place I own on 49th.

47:02.690 --> 47:04.021
I'm calling.

47:04.530 --> 47:07.522
Ya know,

47:09.990 --> 47:12.367
I always wanted
an apartment in Midtown.

47:15.410 --> 47:16.456
Boom.

47:16.540 --> 47:18.167
- That's the ballgame, fellas.
- Motherfucker!

47:18.250 --> 47:20.457
No fucking way.

47:24.590 --> 47:25.909
That hurts.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.631
What can I say,
it's the luck 0' the Guineas.

47:33.510 --> 47:38.129
All right, so,
do we go measure for drapes, or...

47:40.440 --> 47:41.805
Michael!

47:42.940 --> 47:44.771
Mr. Pipilo. Good evening.

47:47.190 --> 47:48.191
You're a smart fella.

47:48.280 --> 47:49.986
What are you doing
wasting your brain here?

47:50.070 --> 47:52.152
- I dig the party.
- I bet you do.

47:52.240 --> 47:53.366
Come on.

47:54.830 --> 47:56.320
Hey, watch it.

47:56.950 --> 47:58.656
Coming through, yes, sir.

48:02.210 --> 48:03.700
Hey! Vince!

48:13.890 --> 48:15.255
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.096
That John Belushi over there?

48:20.190 --> 48:23.478
Yeah. He's a maniac, but he spends.

48:23.560 --> 48:26.017
You know,
I like that samurai thing he does.

48:31.950 --> 48:32.939
That's a good one, Rudy.

48:33.030 --> 48:36.614
- Wanna meet him?
- Nah. Let him have his fun.

48:38.450 --> 48:41.362
So, what's the latest?

48:41.460 --> 48:43.917
About Paul's place, he sign a lease?

48:44.000 --> 48:46.457
Yeah, just today.

48:46.550 --> 48:50.293
I'm very happy for the kid.
Tell him I'm wishing him much success.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.085
But?

48:53.180 --> 48:56.718
But things could get ugly. Soon.

48:56.810 --> 48:59.631
This shit with the parlors,
with Hodas and the Horse...

48:59.730 --> 49:01.015
If they want to come at us sideways,

49:01.100 --> 49:03.261
they might decide
to go after our people.

49:03.350 --> 49:07.059
Midtown, downtown, anywhere.
You should warn Paul.

49:07.150 --> 49:09.732
Let him make an informed decision
about his future endeavors.

49:09.820 --> 49:12.277
- I'll make sure he gets the word.
- Good.

49:13.780 --> 49:16.943
Next order of business,
and it pains me to say this,

49:17.030 --> 49:20.033
- but your fucking idiot brother.
- What now?

49:20.120 --> 49:21.701
Irene says that he walked off

49:21.790 --> 49:24.076
with another truckload of cash
this evening.

49:24.170 --> 49:25.990
- Fuck.
- We're leaking money, Vince.

49:26.080 --> 49:28.048
He's a liability.

49:29.710 --> 49:31.712
On account of him
being your flesh and blood,

49:31.800 --> 49:33.290
I'm not gonna hurt him.

49:33.380 --> 49:35.041
But I am gonna ask
for his resignation.

49:37.680 --> 49:40.808
Hey, he had a good run, right?

49:41.140 --> 49:43.973
Tommy here'll give him the news,
assuming he can find him.

49:44.060 --> 49:46.551
No, no, I'll do it. I'll talk to him.

49:46.650 --> 49:49.187
Tommy. I'll handle it.

49:54.950 --> 49:56.156
Relax, Vince.

49:56.240 --> 49:58.367
I got other errands.

50:01.240 --> 50:03.652
Hey, hit me up again.

50:03.750 --> 50:07.379
You got a full house in here tonight.
Not a lot of tail.

50:08.920 --> 50:11.297
- Hey.
- You won!

50:11.380 --> 50:13.007
Best Supporting Actress.

50:13.090 --> 50:16.002
Wow, that is so cool.
C.C., isn't that cool?

50:16.090 --> 50:17.546
Yeah.

50:17.640 --> 50:19.881
We got ourselves
a bona fide celebrity in the house.

50:20.350 --> 50:24.263
- So, what's it like out there?
- LA is so amazing.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.142
It's so sunny and warm,

50:27.230 --> 50:30.358
and all the people there
are, like, totally beautiful.

50:30.520 --> 50:33.239
Like, everyone looks like
they could be in the movies.

50:33.320 --> 50:36.653
- Did you meet anybody famous?
- I saw Jackie Gayle.

50:36.740 --> 50:38.116
Who's that?

50:38.780 --> 50:41.658
He opened for Sinatra in Vegas, dummy.

50:43.370 --> 50:45.326
I also talked to a lot of producers,

50:45.410 --> 50:48.243
and after this,
they're all gonna want me.

50:49.130 --> 50:52.452
Well, yeah.
You're on the all-world team now.

50:52.550 --> 50:55.963
That little lady there says
you rate 2K for a straight fuck.

50:58.840 --> 51:00.546
I won this for acting.

51:03.520 --> 51:07.138
Okay. Yeah. Acting.

51:07.230 --> 51:11.439
I'm serious. And you know what else?

51:11.520 --> 51:13.522
I'm done tricking.

51:14.610 --> 51:15.850
Oh?

51:18.030 --> 51:21.693
You done now? Just like that?

51:23.200 --> 51:25.248
Best Supporting Actress, C.C.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.365
Readit

51:40.300 --> 51:41.631
Fuck.

51:46.020 --> 51:48.432
Don't forget what you are.

51:59.740 --> 52:02.026
So, this is it, huh? Fluff 'n Fresh.

52:03.330 --> 52:04.524
Yep.

52:04.620 --> 52:08.329
"In by 12:00, out by 5:00."
At least the hours ain't bad.

52:10.540 --> 52:12.030
Fucking imbecile.

52:13.250 --> 52:15.992
- What?
- Nothing.

52:17.210 --> 52:19.667
You got people that can run
this fucking place?

52:20.840 --> 52:23.752
- Hyun-sook.
- Suck what?

52:24.970 --> 52:26.517
You're gonna need the help.

52:27.430 --> 52:31.184
All right. I look forward
to doing business with him.

52:32.020 --> 52:33.396
Her.

52:35.110 --> 52:36.316
Hey, Liam!

52:37.730 --> 52:38.890
Yeah?

52:39.490 --> 52:40.775
Happy St. Patty's Day.

52:40.860 --> 52:42.191
Fuck you.

52:50.040 --> 52:53.532
That Hodas bastard's
up to all kinda nasty shit.

52:53.630 --> 52:56.087
Underage, illegals.

52:56.170 --> 52:57.159
You got a Green card?

52:57.250 --> 52:58.376
I'm Puerto Rican.

52:58.840 --> 53:02.173
Well, you better get one.
I'm not joking.

53:02.260 --> 53:05.218
The cops are gonna start
cracking down. You gotta be ready.

53:05.300 --> 53:08.679
Your boyfriend, Flanagan, won't be
able to help when it comes down.

53:08.770 --> 53:11.557
What the hell
is going on there, anyway?

53:11.640 --> 53:12.971
I think he loves me.

53:13.060 --> 53:14.641
Then you got the ideal customer.

53:14.860 --> 53:17.351
That kind of addiction?
Worse than heroin.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.897
- And better for you.
- Don't say that.

53:19.990 --> 53:21.480
You make it sound cheap.

53:21.570 --> 53:25.154
- What, you're in love with him, too?
- He's nice.

53:26.660 --> 53:29.538
These guys come in here
looking to fall in love,

53:29.620 --> 53:31.576
bunch of fucking saps.

53:31.660 --> 53:32.866
Bobby.

53:34.370 --> 53:36.372
Johnnie Walker, rocks.

53:38.210 --> 53:39.791
You here for some gash, Tommy?

53:40.170 --> 53:41.580
No.

53:41.670 --> 53:45.174
Just thought I'd say hello.
Was in the neighborhood.

53:48.510 --> 53:49.966
Always business with you.

53:54.940 --> 53:56.726
Christ, this city!

53:57.360 --> 53:59.009
The Bronx is burning.

54:03.570 --> 54:08.360
That ain't the Bronx.
Round up the girls.

54:09.080 --> 54:10.729
We may have to hustle 'em
out the back.

54:10.830 --> 54:12.320
Gotcha, boss.

54:12.830 --> 54:14.286
Come on.

54:19.420 --> 54:22.878
Christ! Fucking parlor
down the street's going up in flames!

54:24.630 --> 54:25.676
Bobby, relax.

54:26.590 --> 54:28.080
Ain't one of ours.

54:31.220 --> 54:33.347
You should visit sometime,
I'm telling ya.

54:33.430 --> 54:36.729
The air coming off the bay
is so refreshing.

54:37.560 --> 54:39.642
It's beautiful.

54:39.730 --> 54:42.608
It's hard to get away
when you're running a place.

54:42.690 --> 54:47.855
And the energy in New York right now,
it's pretty incredible.

54:48.240 --> 54:52.028
_ You should check out CB's.
Willy DeVille is there this weekend.

54:52.830 --> 54:54.786
- I'm in.
- Yo.

54:56.040 --> 54:57.450
Dear Abby.

54:58.330 --> 55:00.332
I need some advice.

55:05.380 --> 55:09.749
I got a girl
who thinks her shit smells like roses.

55:10.600 --> 55:12.420
And the truth is,

55:12.510 --> 55:15.923
she's strung the fuck out on freeze
and getting near her sell-by date.

55:17.270 --> 55:21.229
What should I do about the bitch?
Signed, "Disrespected."

55:22.230 --> 55:25.563
Um... Dear Disrespected,

55:25.650 --> 55:27.777
I suggest you skip the drink,

55:28.820 --> 55:32.233
go home,
and take your bullshit with you.

55:35.250 --> 55:39.539
My goodness.
You back up on that horse, I see.

55:42.920 --> 55:44.660
Which Bee Gee are you?

55:46.300 --> 55:48.837
I'm Dave. Have a seat, man.

55:48.930 --> 55:51.080
No, actually,
I think you should leave, C.C.

55:53.930 --> 55:55.557
Oh.

55:55.640 --> 55:59.189
Sorry. I didn't realize.

55:59.600 --> 56:01.147
Soon as I get my Hennessy,

56:01.230 --> 56:03.892
you two can go back to making
goo-goo eyes at each other

56:03.980 --> 56:06.528
like a couple of fucking bobby soxers.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.206
How you been, Ash?

56:22.000 --> 56:23.627
My name's Dorothy.

56:47.860 --> 56:50.021
You have a good evening,

56:51.610 --> 56:53.066
Dorothy.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.700
Who was that?

57:13.050 --> 57:14.881
Nobody.
