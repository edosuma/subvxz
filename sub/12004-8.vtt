Previously on "Switched at birth"...

00:07.390 --> 00:10.249
- How do you know about that?
- He thinks that it's my dad's.

00:10.250 --> 00:12.089
We found this guitar pick in his car,

00:12.090 --> 00:14.879
so what do you think is in the guitar case?

00:14.880 --> 00:17.710
What big secret does the hospital board
have on the Kennish family?

00:17.710 --> 00:19.759
It's not what we have on you or Kathryn.

00:19.760 --> 00:20.794
- It's the other mom.
- Regina?

00:55.308 --> 00:56.750
You almost ready?

01:03.840 --> 01:05.050
Where did you...

01:06.260 --> 01:07.530
How did...

01:08.880 --> 01:10.100
Put those back.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.160
What is this?

01:16.830 --> 01:18.249
There are pictures of Bay

01:18.250 --> 01:20.569
when she was four years old,
eight years old.

01:20.570 --> 01:22.390
How do you have these?

01:23.040 --> 01:27.169
It's nothing. Kathryn gave them to me.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.270
She thought it would be nice for me to have.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.130
Don't lie to me.

01:42.030 --> 01:44.660
I knew, okay?

01:46.080 --> 01:50.640
I knew that you and Bay

01:52.770 --> 01:54.330
were switched.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.370
What do you mean you knew?

02:11.580 --> 02:13.620
Why didn't you do anything?

02:14.680 --> 02:16.100
I found out...

02:19.010 --> 02:20.150
Doorbell.

02:28.140 --> 02:31.209
Hi. Uh, look, I know it's early,

02:31.210 --> 02:34.390
but I was at this little boutique
on Mulberry street

02:34.490 --> 02:37.169
and I saw this scarf and I thought of you.

02:37.170 --> 02:38.849
You look so pretty in pink.

02:38.850 --> 02:40.569
- Here. Come here.
- Oh.

02:40.570 --> 02:43.230
You know, it seemed like
something that you'd wear.

02:44.900 --> 02:46.940
Hi. How are...

02:47.350 --> 02:50.030
Oh, am I interrupting something?

02:50.490 --> 02:52.990
No no no no. It's fine.

02:53.050 --> 02:56.689
Thank you. It's beautiful and it is me.

02:56.690 --> 02:59.329
I guess I'm just so glad

02:59.330 --> 03:00.959
that we're all in a good place

03:00.960 --> 03:02.980
and all that stuff is behind us.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.200
I'm just so happy you're here

03:05.420 --> 03:06.860
and this is working out.

03:29.990 --> 03:32.139
Wait wait. Can I take you?

03:32.140 --> 03:35.030
We could stop and get an ice-blended.

03:35.710 --> 03:38.310
Yeah, I'd love to go with you.

03:42.190 --> 03:43.430
Teenagers.

03:43.470 --> 03:44.380
Yeah.

03:52.210 --> 03:54.149
Oh hey, Regina. Can I grab you for a minute?

03:54.150 --> 03:55.729
I'm actually late.
I've got to pick up some supplies.

03:55.730 --> 03:57.549
It'll just take two seconds, I promise.

03:57.550 --> 03:58.830
Thank you. Thank you.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.749
You know we've got that deposition

04:00.750 --> 04:02.919
for our lawsuit against
the hospital tomorrow.

04:02.920 --> 04:07.020
And we've been told that
they've got something on you.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.859
Any idea what that could be?

04:08.860 --> 04:10.950
Because, you know, I just
don't want to get blind-sided.

04:11.070 --> 04:13.549
I'm sure it's my D.U.I.s
from a million years ago.

04:13.550 --> 04:15.100
No, actually it's not.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.649
My source tells me that it's something else,

04:18.800 --> 04:20.639
something bigger.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.889
Well, I'm not secretly
leading a drug cartel,

04:22.890 --> 04:24.350
if that's what you're asking.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.060
No, I'm not asking that.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.939
I assume if you dig deep
enough into anyone's past,

04:29.940 --> 04:32.320
you will find something to
make them look bad to a jury.

04:32.430 --> 04:35.780
Yeah, well, I'm sure we'll find out.

04:45.810 --> 04:46.840
Oh!

04:48.060 --> 04:50.229
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no problem.

04:50.230 --> 04:52.120
I'm used to girls throwing themselves at me.

04:53.450 --> 04:56.800
Come on, that deserves a smile,
or at least an eye roll.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.520
Aren't you suspended?

04:58.660 --> 05:00.420
Just getting books out of my locker.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.269
Turns out we're still supposed
to have our homework done.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.939
- Man, what a rip-off.
- Yeah you deserve a real vacation

05:05.940 --> 05:08.059
after breaking the school
and stealing the test.

05:08.060 --> 05:09.270
True dat.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.530
So what are you whipping
up in cooking today?

05:11.630 --> 05:14.890
- Who cares?
- Hey, are you okay?

05:16.250 --> 05:17.490
Not really.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.570
You want to get out of here?

05:21.230 --> 05:23.090
Sure. Where do you want to go?

05:24.280 --> 05:25.480
Back in time.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.830
Hey, you.

05:47.830 --> 05:50.189
Yeah, no, don't give me
the sultry James Dean smirk.

05:50.190 --> 05:52.450
What the hell were you
thinking kissing me like that?

05:52.480 --> 05:53.539
I had everything planned out.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.219
I was going to mope around my art studio,

05:55.220 --> 05:56.859
painting melodramatic paintings,

05:56.860 --> 05:59.710
listening to Adele, pining for Ty,

06:00.720 --> 06:03.319
and you showed up and you kissed
me and you ruined everything.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.319
Now I can't get you out of my head.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.809
What was that even about? Okay?

06:05.810 --> 06:06.839
Are you just messing with me?

06:06.840 --> 06:08.149
Did it mean anything to you at all?

06:08.150 --> 06:10.419
Are you just using me to get to Daphne?

06:10.420 --> 06:12.829
You know what? I... I don't even really care.

06:12.830 --> 06:15.350
All right? I'm just really annoyed.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.730
Does that mean "Finished"?

06:20.280 --> 06:23.470
Yes, I am finished. Your turn.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.140
Okay.

06:38.020 --> 06:39.589
On the upside, this is the last place

06:39.590 --> 06:42.020
anyone would think you
came after ditching school.

06:42.100 --> 06:45.360
On the downside, this is
the last place you'd want to come.

06:45.850 --> 06:48.360
I used to live here before
I moved to Mission Hills.

06:48.720 --> 06:52.550
Um, you sure it's okay
to leave the Wilke-mobile?

06:52.840 --> 06:54.839
You know, just because
people don't live in mansions

06:54.840 --> 06:56.940
doesn't mean they go around stealing cars.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.819
Yeah, you can't hear the sirens.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.380
That's why you're so cool about it.

07:11.450 --> 07:14.860
- You're like veal.
- Young and tasty?

07:15.700 --> 07:18.460
Raised in a box, sheltered from everything.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.050
You're not wrong.

07:27.260 --> 07:29.279
Now they're going to
come at you aggressively.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.649
The trick is to answer
the question truthfully,

07:31.650 --> 07:34.540
saying as little as
possible and staying calm.

07:34.570 --> 07:36.269
- Got it?
- Absolutely.

07:36.270 --> 07:39.029
- Perfect. Okay, let's begin.
- Yes.

07:39.030 --> 07:43.380
Kathryn, let's go back
to october 22nd, 1995.

07:43.520 --> 07:47.150
Do you recall allowing
your baby to be taken to the nursery?

07:47.520 --> 07:50.549
Yes. A lot of moms let their
babies go to the nursery.

07:50.550 --> 07:52.839
I was exhausted. It was a very hard labor.

07:52.840 --> 07:57.090
Kathryn, just a simple response.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.330
Yes, of course. Sorry.

07:59.370 --> 08:02.819
Um, yes, she went back to the nursery

08:02.820 --> 08:05.459
so I could get a few hours of sleep.

08:05.460 --> 08:06.739
And when they brought her back,

08:06.740 --> 08:08.910
had you taken any medication?

08:09.060 --> 08:13.129
I was on painkillers,
which the hospital provided.

08:13.130 --> 08:14.530
At your request?

08:15.660 --> 08:17.740
Yes. Uh, no.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.689
They gave me some, but I was still hurting,

08:20.690 --> 08:23.319
so I requested another dose.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.749
The baby's birth weight
is listed as 7.2 lbs,

08:26.750 --> 08:30.900
but on october 23rd,
the weight dropped to 6.5 lbs.

08:32.559 --> 08:33.780
Yes?

08:34.530 --> 08:37.058
That's a pretty substantial change in weight

08:37.059 --> 08:38.809
in less than 24 hours.

08:38.940 --> 08:40.828
Did you alert someone or were

08:40.830 --> 08:43.219
you too zonked out on painkillers to bother?

08:43.220 --> 08:46.079
No! I mean, yes.

08:46.080 --> 08:48.519
I told the nurse, but she said that

08:48.520 --> 08:50.659
my milk hadn't come in
and I should keep trying.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.119
I mean they always make the women
feel like it's their fault.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.039
- That goes back 100 years.
- So you knew something was wrong?

08:56.040 --> 08:58.199
- Yes, I knew it wasn't right.
- No, sweetie, you can't say...

08:58.200 --> 08:59.879
She won't say that in the deposition.

08:59.880 --> 09:01.359
Well, if you knew something was wrong,

09:01.360 --> 09:02.800
why didn't you make them test the baby?

09:03.030 --> 09:05.889
Is there any reason you would
want to switch the babies?

09:05.890 --> 09:08.560
- What? Why would I do that?
- Kathryn, just...

09:08.980 --> 09:10.650
What about your father?

09:10.670 --> 09:12.889
He was at the hospital that day, wasn't he?

09:12.890 --> 09:15.240
Of course. Both my parents were there.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.079
He was in trouble with the I.R.S.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.560
and about to declare bankruptcy.

09:18.650 --> 09:21.039
Perhaps he was trying to do
something that would look like

09:21.040 --> 09:23.199
hospital malpractice so he could sue.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.240
That is the most idiotic thing I've ever...

09:25.780 --> 09:27.119
What? You try it!

09:27.120 --> 09:29.920
- Okay, I will.
- Let's talk about Sarah Lazar.

09:31.100 --> 09:34.059
She was a reporter for
"The Kansas city herald"'s sports section.

09:34.060 --> 09:34.899
Yeah, I know who she is,

09:34.900 --> 09:37.080
- but why are you bringing her up?
- John.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.780
They're going to try to rattle you.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.630
Well, consider us rattled.

09:46.990 --> 09:48.800
I have to talk to him now.

09:48.990 --> 09:51.820
- Yes, now.
- Bye, love.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.830
- Remember, 8:00 A.M. tomorrow.
- Right.

09:57.880 --> 10:01.130
I thought private investigators
are supposed to be discrete.

10:01.580 --> 10:03.609
Tell him it's Regina Vasquez.

10:03.610 --> 10:05.119
I need to know what he told the hospital

10:05.120 --> 10:07.030
and who the hell else he's been talking to.

10:10.620 --> 10:11.700
Wow!

10:11.760 --> 10:13.620
I didn't peg you for a big drinker.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.690
In the daytime, no less.

10:16.350 --> 10:19.580
Yeah well, everyone's
full of surprises, right?

10:20.060 --> 10:22.800
You know, you don't have to get
me drunk to take advantage of me.

10:23.380 --> 10:25.280
That's not why we're getting drunk.

10:26.010 --> 10:27.410
Why are we?

10:34.320 --> 10:35.880
Is everyone a liar?

10:37.480 --> 10:38.580
Pretty much.

10:38.700 --> 10:40.520
Really? Because I'm not.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.399
- You don't lie?
- I don't.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.300
- I know one thing already you lie about.
- What?

10:45.410 --> 10:48.389
That guy... Eddie, Edward.

10:48.390 --> 10:50.779
The... the drummer, your friend.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.189
- Emmett?
- Yeah. See, I knew it was a name from "Twilight."

10:53.190 --> 10:54.200
Okay.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.449
You're lying to that guy
every time you pretend

10:57.450 --> 10:59.360
you don't know he's in love with you.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.190
- He's not.
- Liar.

11:13.050 --> 11:15.400
How do you say "Kiss" in sign language?

11:30.900 --> 11:32.910
Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.000
How do you say "Laugh"?

11:36.950 --> 11:38.020
Laugh.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.460
Can I ask you a question?

11:53.080 --> 11:57.780
Do you ever speak, like, with your voice?

12:04.470 --> 12:05.700
Why not?

12:06.650 --> 12:07.829
Is it because you're embarrassed?

12:07.830 --> 12:09.680
Because you don't have to be with me.

12:12.910 --> 12:15.970
You don't need to?

12:16.660 --> 12:20.329
Well, yeah, you haven't needed to

12:20.330 --> 12:22.789
because you're usually
around people who sign.

12:22.790 --> 12:24.180
But with me...

12:32.240 --> 12:35.139
I know. I'm learning to sign.

12:35.140 --> 12:38.240
I've got books. I'm on, like,
three different sites,

12:38.270 --> 12:40.440
and my private lessons with you.

12:41.660 --> 12:45.080
But in the meantime,

12:46.390 --> 12:49.630
Do you think that you could...

12:56.310 --> 12:58.139
Could we go back to kissing?

12:58.140 --> 12:59.600
We do that really well.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.719
I just can't believe they're
dredging everything up.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.059
Honey, you've just got to
let it roll off your back.

13:15.060 --> 13:18.110
They're dragging my father
into it and that woman.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.999
The hospital screwed up
and now they're making us

13:21.000 --> 13:23.069
feel like we're the ones that are on trial.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.709
That is exactly what they want, okay?

13:24.710 --> 13:27.099
They want us to feel guilty
so that we drop the case.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.860
- And please don't say, "Maybe we should."
- And why not?

13:29.860 --> 13:32.089
I never wanted this.
I never wanted to sue anybody.

13:32.090 --> 13:33.809
Because they're the ones
that messed up, okay?

13:33.810 --> 13:35.609
We are trying to hold them
accountable, all right?

13:35.610 --> 13:36.850
I am not the bad guy here.

13:37.610 --> 13:39.899
I can't remember if these
dishes are dirty or clean now.

13:39.900 --> 13:42.000
- Here, let me help.
- I can handle it!

14:11.280 --> 14:13.680
I think you missed one of
her brushing her teeth.

14:15.570 --> 14:16.910
Never mind.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.999
Friends? Okay.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.370
It's just you have a whole lot
of pictures of your friend

14:43.380 --> 14:46.320
who happens to look a whole
lot like Rachel McAdams.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.560
You don't have to do that.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.730
No. Okay okay okay. It's fine.

15:07.380 --> 15:08.510
Okay.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.210
Damn. Aw.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.610
How many unpaid tickets do you have?

15:28.570 --> 15:29.689
Nine.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.399
- Nine!
- Yeah.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.009
You didn't think they were
going to do something?

15:33.010 --> 15:34.680
Well, eight didn't seem to matter.

15:35.180 --> 15:37.570
And you were worried about the neighborhood.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.550
Not to worry. I have a boot guy.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.510
- Of course you do.
- Of course I do.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.939
But he might take
a little while to get here.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.600
He's not the most punctual.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.900
- Good boot guys are hard to find.
- Yes, they are.

16:39.490 --> 16:42.120
Oh my god.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.709
I got to say, you're more
fun than I thought you were.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.490
I can't see your lips. I don't want to talk.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.340
Seriously, you should drink more often.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.490
With my mom in A.A.

17:02.070 --> 17:03.910
I usually try to stay away.

17:04.770 --> 17:06.030
Stupid me.

17:06.069 --> 17:07.890
Wait, Kathryn's an alcoholic?

17:08.540 --> 17:12.010
No, my other mother is.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.810
What is that like, the whole switched thing?

17:19.579 --> 17:22.210
What? Is the spell broken?

17:24.000 --> 17:25.319
Kind of.

17:26.630 --> 17:28.130
Can I unbreak it?

17:30.690 --> 17:31.890
No.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.430
- This is a bad idea.
- No, it's a very good idea.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.660
Seriously?

17:41.840 --> 17:43.530
Because I brought up the switch thing?

17:47.310 --> 17:49.220
It's not going to happen tonight.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.720
Wait, another night?

18:02.470 --> 18:06.600
I'll take you home as soon
as my boot guy gets here.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.570
It's okay. I'll just text
my friend to come get me.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.100
Oh!

18:22.800 --> 18:25.330
I love that piece.

18:26.530 --> 18:28.720
Cool? Cool.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.949
I have to tell you something.

18:34.950 --> 18:37.309
It's something I only told one other person

18:37.310 --> 18:39.440
And that's because
he discovered me doing it.

18:41.690 --> 18:43.309
Oh, sorry. I'm just...

18:43.310 --> 18:47.270
I'm really excited to tell you,
because you'll get it.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.050
Who was that?

19:00.060 --> 19:04.589
Anyway, do you know those posters
of the girl in the pink dress?

19:04.590 --> 19:07.410
sometimes she has an axe,
sometimes she has a hammer.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.370
Daphne again?

19:13.360 --> 19:15.829
Is she about to get eaten
by a lion or something?

19:15.830 --> 19:17.650
Is there anything that she needs?

19:21.080 --> 19:22.850
Okay... wow, seriously?

19:25.310 --> 19:27.730
Ding ding, Daphne calls.

19:29.950 --> 19:31.430
Whatever, Emmett.

19:34.960 --> 19:38.640
I don't know what you're
saying and I don't care.

19:40.670 --> 19:43.360
No, forget it. Oh, don't forget your camera

19:43.360 --> 19:46.162
you should wanna capture
this moment for your Daphne shrine.

20:02.420 --> 20:04.360
- My ride's here.
- Oh.

20:09.020 --> 20:11.120
- What?
- Liar.

20:11.890 --> 20:14.619
Hey, buddy. Nice taxi service you run.

20:14.620 --> 20:17.740
You do this for everyone?
Or just special friends?

20:36.390 --> 20:37.779
Seriously, thanks for getting me

20:37.780 --> 20:39.249
out of my head for a couple of hours.

20:39.250 --> 20:42.180
I feel used. I wish you would use me more.

21:10.311 --> 21:12.909
I mean Tyler.

21:14.498 --> 21:15.807
I guess he's a private.

21:15.807 --> 21:18.806
What do you call a guy that's in training?

21:18.807 --> 21:22.473
Oh no, please, couldn't you
bend the rules just this once?

21:22.474 --> 21:25.123
I really need to talk to him.

21:26.023 --> 21:28.823
No, he didn't get me pregnant.

21:28.824 --> 21:31.689
If he did, could I talk to him?

21:31.690 --> 21:32.923
Oh...

21:32.924 --> 21:35.224
Way to protect and serve.

21:44.824 --> 21:48.823
Hey, Liam, it's Bay. I'm just checking in.

21:48.824 --> 21:51.756
It's been a while since we last spoke.

21:51.757 --> 21:54.923
Things just got so weird between us and...

21:54.924 --> 21:58.257
You know what... just call me
back when you get a chance.

21:59.957 --> 22:03.177
- What are you doing?
- Why are you spying on me?

22:03.177 --> 22:06.656
Why are you taking a trip down
I-dated-Bay-Kennish memory lane?

22:06.657 --> 22:09.022
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.956
It's just sometimes
it's nice to talk to a guy

22:11.957 --> 22:15.723
who seemed to care about you.

22:15.724 --> 22:18.956
Well, maybe this will cheer you up.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.970
Oh my god.

22:23.173 --> 22:24.134
I know.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.022
I don't know what's worse...

22:25.023 --> 22:28.022
The goofy smile or the hairy chest.

22:28.023 --> 22:31.923
All I can say is I'm so
glad I'm not related to him.

22:31.924 --> 22:34.623
Hey, you just drunk dialed
Liam when you were sober.

22:34.624 --> 22:37.090
Bad judgment runs in your gene pool too.

22:37.957 --> 22:39.990
Thanks.

22:41.023 --> 22:44.090
- Kind of looks like you.
- Shut up.

22:47.624 --> 22:50.823
- Regina, you need some help?
- No no. I got it.

22:50.824 --> 22:52.623
I didn't know you played guitar.

22:52.624 --> 22:53.591
You should jam with Toby sometime.

22:53.591 --> 22:56.022
- Sweetie, I found your reading glasses.
- Oh thanks.

22:56.023 --> 22:58.054
Hey, Regina, I didn't
know you played guitar.

22:58.054 --> 23:00.789
- You should jam with Toby sometime.
- I just said that.

23:00.790 --> 23:02.556
I don't really play.

23:02.557 --> 23:03.839
It's just an old case I'm getting rid of.

23:03.839 --> 23:05.994
- Can I help you with that?
- No no no! I got it.

23:07.591 --> 23:09.643
That's a guitar case.

23:09.643 --> 23:11.811
It was taking up too
much space in my closet.

23:12.287 --> 23:13.815
You're getting rid of it?

23:13.815 --> 23:15.956
Yeah. I'm clearing out some things.

23:15.957 --> 23:18.474
Oh. Uh hey, could I keep it?

23:18.474 --> 23:20.664
I think it would make
a really cool art piece.

23:20.664 --> 23:22.279
You know, it's from an ex-boyfriend

23:22.279 --> 23:24.313
and I really don't want
to be seeing it around,

23:24.313 --> 23:26.931
so I'd prefer to get rid of it.

23:26.931 --> 23:28.592
Symbolic, you know?

23:30.301 --> 23:31.789
A little late to go to goodwill.

23:31.790 --> 23:33.055
Aren't they closed?

23:33.056 --> 23:35.302
Only one way to find out.

23:42.924 --> 23:46.498
- Was that strange?
- Very.

27:10.836 --> 27:12.300
Way too much shoulder pad.

27:12.300 --> 27:15.073
You want to look confident,
not like a linebacker.

27:15.073 --> 27:17.206
Okay. Well, how about this one then?

27:17.207 --> 27:18.575
Oh, that's nice. It looks

27:18.576 --> 27:21.072
like you're going on
vacation in the Bahamas.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.206
Not exactly the look I'm looking for.

27:24.199 --> 27:26.974
I hope I don't screw this up.
It would kill your father.

27:28.803 --> 27:31.306
Why is this lawsuit so important to him?

27:31.307 --> 27:33.772
It's not like we're hurting for money.

27:38.106 --> 27:40.139
I think your dad feels like

27:40.140 --> 27:43.172
this switch was his fault,

27:43.173 --> 27:46.507
like he should've noticed or something.

27:47.573 --> 27:50.507
I think this is his way of making up for it.

27:52.173 --> 27:54.172
- It's that one.
- Hmm?

27:54.173 --> 27:57.206
- Is it?
- It's a great contrast with your hair.

27:57.207 --> 28:01.373
- It also makes you sound pretty wise.
- Really?

28:03.339 --> 28:06.438
Oh, sorry for the roadblock.
I'm trying to find something.

28:06.439 --> 28:07.932
Isn't the Kennish family motto

28:07.933 --> 28:10.206
"If you can't find something,
buy a new one"?

28:10.207 --> 28:13.607
Well, money can't buy what I'm looking for.
Have you seen this?

28:15.372 --> 28:17.338
- Wow.
- Exactly.

28:17.339 --> 28:19.371
Who knows what else is
hiding in these boxes?

28:19.372 --> 28:20.726
- Maybe a calendar spread.
- You know,

28:20.726 --> 28:22.683
sometimes things are
best left in the past.

28:22.683 --> 28:25.557
You start digging around,
you never know what you're gonna find.

28:26.006 --> 28:28.474
Oh hey, guys. You guys are all decked out.

28:29.292 --> 28:31.357
It's deposition day.

28:31.439 --> 28:32.910
Wish us luck.

28:33.406 --> 28:35.208
- Is that today?
- Yeah, we're finally gonna

28:35.208 --> 28:37.412
get to the bottom of what really happened.

28:37.814 --> 28:39.774
Well, break a leg, I guess.

28:39.774 --> 28:43.706
And if you do, you can sue
the hospital for that too.

28:44.667 --> 28:45.835
-Did you tell the nurse?
- Yes.

28:45.835 --> 28:47.678
I asked her to double-check and she told me

28:47.678 --> 28:50.223
- that I was being neurotic.
- At what point did you suspect

28:50.223 --> 28:52.729
that Bay might not be
your biological daughter?

28:52.729 --> 28:54.306
I never suspected.

28:54.307 --> 28:57.507
And when people asked
you if she was adopted?

28:58.237 --> 29:00.858
That only happened a few times
and I just thought it was rude.

29:00.858 --> 29:03.505
But if they noticed that there
was no physical resemblance,

29:03.506 --> 29:06.369
- why didn't you?
- objection... asked and answered.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.654
Sir, she's our daughter, not our clone.

29:08.654 --> 29:10.696
- Move on, Ed.
- All right.

29:15.932 --> 29:17.923
Okay, what was in the guitar case?

29:17.923 --> 29:20.306
- What are you doing here?
- The guitar case.

29:20.307 --> 29:22.139
Regina's guitar case.

29:22.140 --> 29:23.036
The one that she suddenly

29:23.037 --> 29:24.538
had to donate in the middle of the night.

29:24.539 --> 29:26.839
What did you find in there?

29:28.439 --> 29:30.505
I want to tell you, but I can't.

29:30.506 --> 29:33.639
- You have to ask your mother.
- My mom?

29:36.240 --> 29:37.538
Do you mean Regina?

29:37.539 --> 29:41.272
Yeah, because she's certainly not mine.

29:42.022 --> 29:42.839
I gotta go.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.284
These are the results from the diatine labs.

29:48.284 --> 29:51.906
Would you mind reading
the highlighted lines please?

29:54.975 --> 29:59.306
"There is a 99.9% certainty
that the child in question,"

29:59.307 --> 30:01.272
"Daphne Paloma Vasquez,"

30:01.273 --> 30:03.831
"born october 22nd, 1995,"

30:03.831 --> 30:07.971
"is not related to Regina Lourdes Vasquez."

30:08.985 --> 30:10.721
Read the date on the report.

30:11.407 --> 30:14.022
"August 13th, 1998."

30:14.240 --> 30:16.276
But that was 13 years ago.

30:16.276 --> 30:18.245
- That's gotta be wrong.
- I don't understand.

30:19.140 --> 30:19.964
Did Regina know?

30:19.965 --> 30:21.538
Is that when Miss Vasquez
first contacted you?

30:21.539 --> 30:22.669
That can't be the right date.

30:22.670 --> 30:23.544
There was no mention of this in discovery.

30:23.544 --> 30:25.993
Just answer the question. When did she first

30:25.993 --> 30:28.167
- contact you?
- What? We contacted her.

30:28.167 --> 30:30.676
- Okay, don't say anything.
- She hired a private investigator

30:30.676 --> 30:33.698
in september of 1998 to locate Bay.

30:35.325 --> 30:37.505
You're saying she's known since 1998

30:37.506 --> 30:39.371
that the girls were switched?

30:39.372 --> 30:40.806
Let me see that.

30:41.606 --> 30:43.348
We need to take a break.

30:46.539 --> 30:49.639
What was her plan?
Was she gonna blackmail us?

30:50.439 --> 30:52.371
We invited her into our home.

30:52.372 --> 30:55.338
I thought we were becoming friends.

30:55.339 --> 30:57.572
There's only one explanation for this

30:57.573 --> 30:59.873
and that is that she's a psychopath.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.507
Do you think Daphne knew?

31:07.539 --> 31:09.739
I don't know.

31:11.273 --> 31:13.438
I feel like I don't know

31:13.439 --> 31:16.639
anything anymore.

31:42.307 --> 31:44.939
- Hey.
- What was in that guitar case?

31:48.273 --> 31:50.006
Daphne told me that she opened it.

31:50.006 --> 31:52.396
If she knows, I wanna know too.
What is in there?

32:09.088 --> 32:13.240
- Did you switch the kids?
- No, I didn't do it.

32:14.137 --> 32:15.462
- It wasn't my fault!
- You lied to me!

32:15.462 --> 32:18.622
- Just let me explain!
- Wait. You knew... what?

32:18.622 --> 32:21.812
- Okay, just give me a minute.
- Fine. Talk.

32:22.144 --> 32:25.028
- Go.
- Okay.

32:28.276 --> 32:33.070
I found out 12 and a half years ago

32:33.909 --> 32:35.657
when Daphne was three.

32:35.838 --> 32:38.528
Angelo, Daphne's father,

32:38.528 --> 32:39.643
he was on me

32:40.246 --> 32:42.044
ever since Daphne was a baby.

32:42.491 --> 32:44.475
Why didn't she look like him?

32:44.476 --> 32:46.409
How could she be so blonde

32:46.410 --> 32:49.308
and blue-eyed and so fair?

32:49.309 --> 32:51.409
I had to have had an affair.

32:51.410 --> 32:53.242
But I hadn't.

32:54.023 --> 32:55.375
First, we were fighting all the time.

32:55.376 --> 32:57.475
I mean, I was drinking, he was drinking.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.175
It wasn't my finest hour.

33:00.464 --> 33:01.797
And then she got sick.

33:01.798 --> 33:03.763
And I know that you think it was my fault,

33:03.764 --> 33:04.906
and I thought that for a long time too.

33:04.907 --> 33:05.663
Regina, I'm sorry.

33:05.664 --> 33:06.797
None of this has to do with anything.

33:06.798 --> 33:09.990
It was meningitis, okay? You know that.

33:09.990 --> 33:13.416
But you don't know how bad it was.

33:13.416 --> 33:14.697
I mean, if you don't catch it in time,

33:14.698 --> 33:17.731
within a few hours, you could die.

33:18.233 --> 33:19.763
And sitting in that hospital,

33:19.764 --> 33:21.556
waiting to see if she was gonna be okay,

33:21.556 --> 33:24.180
I would not wish that on any parent.

33:24.180 --> 33:26.129
What do you want from us, sympathy?

33:26.129 --> 33:29.480
No, I just need you to understand.

33:29.480 --> 33:31.808
Just get to the point where you knew.

33:34.531 --> 33:36.430
They were gonna give her an antibiotic

33:36.431 --> 33:38.697
that had a chance of making her deaf.

33:38.698 --> 33:40.288
- But what was my choice?
- Actually,

33:40.289 --> 33:41.697
if you'd shared this information

33:41.698 --> 33:42.407
other resources could've

33:42.408 --> 33:43.697
- been brought to bear!
- I didn't know by then!

33:43.698 --> 33:45.763
- I didn't know! I didn't know!
- Stop!

33:46.516 --> 33:48.689
Please, just let her finish.

33:51.957 --> 33:54.697
She was in the I.C.U. for eight days.

33:54.698 --> 33:56.630
And I never left her side.

33:56.631 --> 34:00.530
And when she got better and
failed the hearing test,

34:00.531 --> 34:04.596
well, Angelo... by now he was sure
that she wasn't his.

34:04.597 --> 34:08.563
I knew it. I knew that's why he left.

34:08.563 --> 34:11.530
He was gonna leave anyway.

34:11.531 --> 34:13.697
I honestly believe that.

34:13.697 --> 34:15.630
And I am not defending him,

34:15.630 --> 34:17.763
but you have to understand

34:17.764 --> 34:21.463
neither of us knew how
to deal with any of this.

34:21.464 --> 34:23.831
So then? You found out then?

34:25.464 --> 34:29.730
Angelo secretly took a swab of her saliva

34:29.731 --> 34:32.697
and had her D.N.A. tested.

34:33.630 --> 34:38.463
And he came back with the results
saying he knew it all along...

34:38.464 --> 34:41.429
That she wasn't his.

34:41.431 --> 34:42.797
She was someone else's.

34:42.797 --> 34:45.630
You know, we had a huge fight and I said

34:45.630 --> 34:47.663
that it was impossible. He was lying.

34:47.664 --> 34:50.897
He was just trying to find
some reason to leave us.

34:51.600 --> 34:53.284
But he left anyway.

34:55.081 --> 34:58.606
And I looked at my blonde,

34:58.606 --> 35:00.763
blue-eyed little girl,

35:00.764 --> 35:04.560
and I had her tested again.

35:06.179 --> 35:08.578
And the results came back the same.

35:08.578 --> 35:13.049
She wasn't biologically related to me.

35:18.932 --> 35:22.425
Why didn't you say anything?

35:25.595 --> 35:28.630
Because she was my daughter by then.

35:28.630 --> 35:31.330
I was an alcoholic,
unemployed single parent.

35:31.330 --> 35:34.155
I was broke. I had nothing...

35:34.155 --> 35:37.585
Nothing but this little baby
that everyone thought was mine

35:37.898 --> 35:40.798
who I loved so much.

35:41.628 --> 35:44.267
I was a mess. I was scared
that if told the truth,

35:44.267 --> 35:46.259
they would've yanked her away from me

35:46.259 --> 35:48.202
and given both kids to the other family.

35:48.202 --> 35:49.911
We wouldn't have done that to you.

35:49.911 --> 35:52.190
You weren't real to me then.

35:52.499 --> 35:54.203
Did grandma know?

35:54.901 --> 35:57.212
No one knew. I didn't tell anybody.

35:57.212 --> 35:58.701
I don't understand how

35:58.701 --> 36:01.633
not telling anybody is making things right.

36:01.634 --> 36:03.733
I looked around at my life

36:03.734 --> 36:05.229
and I made a decision.

36:05.229 --> 36:07.834
I would clean myself up,
I would figure it out

36:07.835 --> 36:11.168
and I would be the best mom that I could be.

36:13.286 --> 36:15.631
I joined A.A., I reconnected with my mom

36:15.631 --> 36:18.801
and I got it together.

36:19.279 --> 36:22.566
And I think I did a pretty good job.

36:26.449 --> 36:28.118
What about me?

36:33.601 --> 36:36.633
You knew

36:36.634 --> 36:40.533
all this time and you never came for me.

36:40.534 --> 36:44.481
Oh, honey, I wanted you.

36:44.481 --> 36:45.767
Of course I wanted you.

36:45.767 --> 36:48.472
I mean, I even hired a private investigator.

36:48.659 --> 36:51.426
He came back with photos and bios

36:51.426 --> 36:53.203
of your parents.

36:53.616 --> 36:56.834
That's what was in the guitar case...

36:56.835 --> 37:00.211
Pictures of you. Tons of pictures of you.

37:00.211 --> 37:01.870
I followed you constantly.

37:01.870 --> 37:04.699
That makes it worse.

37:06.901 --> 37:09.168
Please try to understand.

37:10.835 --> 37:14.001
You were Bay Kennish by then,

37:14.955 --> 37:15.824
and I would've been ripping you

37:15.824 --> 37:19.567
from the only family that you ever knew.

37:19.568 --> 37:24.168
But I was your daughter. Me.

37:25.259 --> 37:27.991
Not her. And you chose her over me.

37:28.413 --> 37:31.268
- Honey.
- No. You knew?

37:31.268 --> 37:32.950
All those years you knew about me?

37:32.950 --> 37:35.867
You followed me and you
never once came for me?

37:35.868 --> 37:38.244
I did what I thought was best for you.

37:38.244 --> 37:40.711
No, you did what was best for you.

37:43.140 --> 37:44.217
Bay, w...

37:45.442 --> 37:46.821
I'll go.

37:49.561 --> 37:50.968
I want you out.

37:56.497 --> 37:58.631
- Honey.
- Don't.

38:11.137 --> 38:13.910
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

38:14.443 --> 38:17.752
All those years we could've
had Daphne in our lives...

38:17.752 --> 38:19.343
- Regina knew.
- That first day we met her

38:19.344 --> 38:21.376
at the genetic counselor's office,

38:21.377 --> 38:24.443
she sat there, she looked us
right in the face and she lied.

38:24.444 --> 38:28.377
She has lied every day since.

38:32.244 --> 38:34.276
We have no idea who that woman is

38:34.277 --> 38:36.109
or what she is capable of.

38:36.110 --> 38:38.711
I want her out of here.

38:40.344 --> 38:42.476
What about Daphne?

38:42.477 --> 38:46.777
We are going to get custody
of both of our daughters.

38:49.110 --> 38:52.143
Honey, all these years

38:52.144 --> 38:54.443
Bay has been searching for something.

38:54.444 --> 38:56.309
I didn't know what it was.

38:56.310 --> 38:59.476
She knew something was wrong.

38:59.477 --> 39:02.410
Now Regina had the answer.

39:06.144 --> 39:08.711
And I don't know if Bay is
ever gonna get over that.

39:12.277 --> 39:14.765
She just shut her eyes and
pretended like I didn't even exist.

39:14.765 --> 39:16.633
Like it was more important
not to risk losing Daphne

39:16.633 --> 39:18.376
than to even try and get me...

39:18.377 --> 39:20.376
No, okay? I don't want to slow down.

39:20.377 --> 39:22.651
I just wanna say what I need to say

39:22.651 --> 39:24.243
and I want you to understand me,

39:24.244 --> 39:26.677
but I can't sign and you can't hear and...

39:28.110 --> 39:29.410
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

39:29.411 --> 39:32.477
This isn't gonna work out.

40:05.439 --> 40:06.777
I know you're mad

40:07.356 --> 40:09.178
and it's gonna take some time,

40:09.178 --> 40:10.874
but I just want to say one thing...

40:10.874 --> 40:12.276
You kept them from me.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.477
You kept me from my family.

40:21.131 --> 40:23.295
I was your family.

40:23.295 --> 40:26.096
The hospital made the mistake, not me.

40:26.097 --> 40:28.560
You were three years old.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.794
You were mine by then.

40:31.477 --> 40:33.007
You are not a mother.

40:33.007 --> 40:35.234
You don't understand.

40:35.234 --> 40:37.891
You're right, I don't,

40:37.891 --> 40:39.971
and neither does Kathryn.

40:41.097 --> 40:44.272
I made a choice that I thought
was best for everyone,

40:44.272 --> 40:46.123
and maybe I was wrong.

40:46.123 --> 40:47.887
Every day you looked me in the eyes

40:47.887 --> 40:51.113
and didn't tell me the
truth about who I was?

40:51.113 --> 40:54.559
- You lied to me!
- But it didn't feel like that.

40:54.559 --> 40:57.625
It didn't feel like a lie
that you were my daughter.

40:57.626 --> 41:00.758
And I can't believe that after
everything we've been through

41:00.759 --> 41:03.625
that you don't see it the same way.

41:03.626 --> 41:06.725
Because why? You taught me how to be strong,

41:06.726 --> 41:09.425
how to handle being different?

41:09.426 --> 41:11.425
You made me who I am?

41:11.426 --> 41:14.358
Do you really think you
would've come out the same here?

41:14.359 --> 41:17.058
- Raised by them?
- I don't know!

41:17.058 --> 41:18.658
- No one knows!
- I know.

41:18.659 --> 41:20.725
I am proud of the job I did raising you.

41:20.726 --> 41:23.109
You don't get the credit for me!

41:23.109 --> 41:26.658
- I have their genes!
- But I fought for you,

41:26.659 --> 41:28.725
I held your hand when you cried

41:28.726 --> 41:31.725
and I tucked you in every night.

41:31.726 --> 41:35.926
And I did it so we could stay a family.

41:40.693 --> 41:44.659
I really think you should go.

41:51.449 --> 41:53.035
Okay.

42:10.182 --> 42:11.859
What are you doing?

42:14.297 --> 42:16.531
- Are you leaving?
- Hmm...

42:16.532 --> 42:20.425
I'm just going to Melody's
for a couple of days.

42:20.426 --> 42:21.725
I don't think anybody wants me here

42:21.726 --> 42:24.859
and I... I really can't blame them.

42:26.392 --> 42:30.993
Well, I don't want to get involved,
but you were there for me

42:31.759 --> 42:33.692
and I know you're a good person.

42:33.693 --> 42:36.758
So I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

42:36.759 --> 42:40.558
I'm sorry to see you go.

42:40.559 --> 42:42.588
Thank you, Toby.

42:56.559 --> 42:59.606
Bay.
