{\an8}I CAN TELL IN HER FACE
SHE'S BECOMING DEPRESSED,

27:48.500 --> 27:50.668
{\an8}AND I DECIDE TO CALL ROGER,

27:50.752 --> 27:56.299

I DON'T WANT TO GET FIRED.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.106
{\an8}- I HAVE TO ASK.
- OH, MY GOD.

28:11.189 --> 28:14.609
{\an8}THIS IS, LIKE, WHAT I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

28:14.692 --> 28:18.571

GONNA COME OVER AND YELL.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.052
{\an8}JUST STAND UP
AND STARE AT HIM.

28:41.136 --> 28:41.970
{\an8}HE'LL BACK DOWN.

{\an8}YOUR SHIFT ENDS SOON.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.821
{\an8}- THANK YOU, DANNY,

{\an8}- OKAY, HE WAS YUM.

{\an8}- OKAY.

{\an8}- I PRAYED TO THE GODS

29:29.767 --> 29:31.519
{\an8}TO HAVE A NICE,
JUICE-HEAD GORILLA,

29:31.603 --> 29:33.188

{\an8}- RIGHT NOW
I WANT TO KILL TOM.

29:40.695 --> 29:43.948
{\an8}HE JUST LEFT THE DOGS THERE
TO PRETTY MUCH DIE.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.452

I DO NOT DESERVE THIS.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.050
{\an8}- YOU GUYS SAW BOYS?

{\an8}AND I'M REALLY EXCITED,

30:09.474 --> 30:10.767
{\an8}BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
NICOLE'S GONNA BE HAPPY

30:10.850 --> 30:12.727
{\an8}ALL OVER AGAIN,
AND I MISS THAT ABOUT HER.

30:12.810 --> 30:14.479
{\an8}- MIGHT HAVE
TO DOUBLE PANTY IT.

30:14.562 --> 30:18.107
{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE BAD.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.407
{\an8}FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO POOP.
I'M GETTING NERVOUS.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.076

{\an8}I HAVE TO [bleep] MY PANTS.

30:40.338 --> 30:41.172
{\an8}LIKE, I GET REALLY EXCITED.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.341

{\an8}- I'M JUST HAVING A GREAT TIME.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.470
{\an8}I THINK THIS DATE
IS SOLIDIFYING

31:29.554 --> 31:31.639
{\an8}THAT I JUST SHOULDN'T
BE WITH TOM,

31:31.723 --> 31:33.141
{\an8}AND THE GRASS IS GREENER
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.392

31:39.856 --> 31:41.274
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT I NEED,

31:41.357 --> 31:43.276
{\an8}AND I WAS WORRIED THAT HE
WASN'T GOING TO BE LIKE THAT,

31:43.359 --> 31:44.652
{\an8}BECAUSE THEN IT'S,
LIKE, AWKWARD,

31:44.736 --> 31:46.321
{\an8}AND YOU'RE LIKE,
"OKAY, YOU'RE BORING ME,"

31:46.404 --> 31:49.490

AN AWESOME GUY.

{\an8}NICK FEELS LIKE THE PERFECT
JUICE-HEAD GORILLA FOR ME,

32:21.648 --> 32:24.484
{\an8}AND I ALSO KIND OF WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM ALREADY.

32:34.452 --> 32:37.955
{\an8}I PRAYED TO THE GODS TO HAVE
A NICE JUICE-HEAD GORILLA,

{\an8}I REALLY DON'T MISS TOM,

32:59.310 --> 33:01.354
{\an8}AND THAT'S KIND OF, LIKE,
A RED FLAG FOR ME

33:01.437 --> 33:02.647
{\an8}THAT I SHOULDN'T BE WITH HIM,

33:02.730 --> 33:06.484

35:06.145 --> 35:07.480
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT NOTHING.

35:07.563 --> 35:09.357
{\an8}SO DO I TAKE
THAT [bleep] TO HEART?

35:09.440 --> 35:13.069
{\an8}YEAH, BECAUSE I DID NOTHING
[bleep] WRONG

35:13.152 --> 35:14.028
{\an8}UP UNTIL THE DAY
I WENT FOR JERSEY,

35:14.111 --> 35:18.115
{\an8}AND YOU STILL
TREATED ME LIKE [bleep]!

35:18.199 --> 35:20.993
{\an8}- NO,
YOU TREAT ME LIKE [bleep].

35:21.410 --> 35:24.372
{\an8}- DONE.

35:49.814 --> 35:53.401
{\an8}[phone dialing]

35:53.484 --> 35:56.445
{\an8}- BECAUSE OF THE FACT
THAT I JUST BROKE UP WITH TOM,

35:56.529 --> 35:58.948
{\an8}MY ANXIETY IS SO HIGH
I CAN'T EVEN THINK.

35:59.031 --> 36:01.242
- HE SAID THAT HE'S UPSET,

36:01.325 --> 36:03.911
AND HE'S STARTING
TO MOVE OUT NOW, BUT...

36:03.995 --> 36:07.456
{\an8}- WHO'S WATCHING MY DOGS?

36:07.540 --> 36:08.457
{\an8}- WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

36:08.541 --> 36:09.792
{\an8}I'M JUST SAYING
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

36:09.876 --> 36:11.210
{\an8}IF THAT BOTHERS YOU THAT MUCH

36:11.294 --> 36:14.088
{\an8}WHERE YOU THINK
SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.091
{\an8}- JUST PLEASE CALL HIM FOR ME.

36:17.174 --> 36:18.301
{\an8}- AND SAY WHAT?

36:18.384 --> 36:20.803
{\an8}- "DON'T TOUCH
ANY OF MY [bleep]."

36:20.887 --> 36:22.597
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT. LOVE YOU.

36:22.680 --> 36:23.681
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
I LOVE YOU TOO.

36:23.764 --> 36:24.932
{\an8}I'LL TALK TO HIM AGAIN.
- ALL RIGHT.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.559
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT?
- BYE.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.394
{\an8}UGH.

36:28.477 --> 36:30.479
{\an8}THE ONLY THING THAT
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WITH TOM

36:30.563 --> 36:33.691
{\an8}IS THE SAFETY OF MY DOGS
AND MY PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

36:33.774 --> 36:38.571
{\an8}BOO, IT'S, LIKE,
AN EMERGENCY.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.656
{\an8}I HAVE TO GO HOME
AND BREAK INTO MY HOUSE

36:40.740 --> 36:42.283
{\an8}AND GET MY DOGS.

36:42.366 --> 36:42.783
{\an8}WILL YOU TAKE
THE DRIVE WITH ME?

36:42.867 --> 36:45.453
{\an8}- OF COURSE.

36:45.536 --> 36:47.121
{\an8}RIGHT NOW
I WANT TO KILL TOM.

36:47.204 --> 36:48.456
{\an8}LIKE, YOU DON'T
LEAVE ANIMALS LIKE THAT ALONE.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.875
{\an8}'CAUSE THEY CAN'T
FEND FOR THEMSELVES.

36:50.958 --> 36:54.503
{\an8}AND NOW HE JUST LEFT THE DOGS
THERE TO PRETTY MUCH DIE.

36:55.296 --> 36:58.341
{\an8}- WHAT A [bleep] FUN DAY
THIS IS.

37:02.386 --> 37:05.264
{\an8}I'M LITERALLY PREPARING
FOR THE WORST.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.808
{\an8}I'M PREPARING
FOR MY [bleep] TO BE SMASHED,

37:07.892 --> 37:10.770
{\an8}MY DOGS TO BE, LIKE, HIDING
IN A CORNER, TRAUMATIZED.

37:10.853 --> 37:13.314
{\an8}AND I'M HOME.

37:20.446 --> 37:21.364
{\an8}LIKE, REALLY?

37:21.447 --> 37:25.618
{\an8}MY DAMN KEYS.

37:25.701 --> 37:26.786
{\an8}TOM LOCKED ME OUT,

37:26.869 --> 37:28.329
{\an8}AND, UM, HE'S BEING
VERY MALICIOUS.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.415
{\an8}AND IT'S ONE THING
TO DRAW HATE TOWARDS ME,

37:31.499 --> 37:34.418
{\an8}BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO TAKE IT OUT
ON MY ANIMALS.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.462
{\an8}THAT MEANS
THE ABSOLUTE WORLD TO ME.

37:36.545 --> 37:38.631
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.844
{\an8}- DO WE HAVE TO BREAK IN?

37:43.928 --> 37:45.680
{\an8}[distant barking]

37:45.763 --> 37:46.514
{\an8}OH, DOGGIES.

37:46.597 --> 37:49.225
{\an8}- HI!

37:49.308 --> 37:51.060
{\an8}- YAY!

37:51.143 --> 37:53.354
{\an8}- LET'S GO.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.194
{\an8}- HI!
- POO-POOS.

38:00.277 --> 38:03.072
{\an8}- HI!
I MISSED YOU TOO.

38:03.155 --> 38:05.533
{\an8}- YOU'RE COMING
TO THE JERSEY SHORE.

38:05.616 --> 38:06.951
{\an8}- I HAVE MY DOGS.

38:07.034 --> 38:08.160
{\an8}THEY'RE SAFE,
THEY'RE CUTE, THEY'RE HAPPY,

38:08.244 --> 38:09.370
{\an8}AND THAT'S ALL I NEED.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.746
{\an8}DO YOU GOT TO GO PEE?
IT'S UPSTAIRS.

38:10.830 --> 38:11.664
{\an8}- YEAH, I NEED TO PISS.

38:11.747 --> 38:14.875
{\an8}- HI.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.336
{\an8}- WHAT HAPPENED?
- YOUR BED'S GONE.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.923
{\an8}- WHAT?
- YOUR BED IS GONE.

38:22.425 --> 38:26.637
{\an8}- REALLY?
MY [bleep] BED?

38:29.807 --> 38:32.601
{\an8}- WHAT ELSE DID HE TAKE?
THAT'S IT?

38:38.357 --> 38:39.900
{\an8}IT WAS IN THERE?

38:39.984 --> 38:42.445
{\an8}- IT WAS ON THE DRESSER
IN THE...

38:44.947 --> 38:47.533
{\an8}TOM TOOK THE BEST
PERSONAL ITEM I COULD HAVE.

38:47.616 --> 38:48.451
{\an8}MY FAVORITE PIECE OF JEWELRY

38:48.534 --> 38:51.078
{\an8}THAT I GOT AS A PRESENT
FOR GRADUATION.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.080
{\an8}IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH TOM.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.708
{\an8}IF TOM'S GONNA BE THIS SPITEFUL
TO STEAL MY WATCH,

38:55.791 --> 38:58.794
{\an8}I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT HE
DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING ELSE.

39:03.966 --> 39:04.467
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S NOT OKAY.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.816
{\an8}ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING ME,
MAN?

39:25.988 --> 39:27.698
{\an8}- IS THAT TO HIM?

39:27.782 --> 39:29.909
{\an8}- YEAH.

39:33.162 --> 39:36.624
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN WANT TO LOOK.

39:36.707 --> 39:39.460
{\an8}ANYMORE.

39:45.382 --> 39:49.261
{\an8}[crying]
I DO NOT DESERVE THIS.

39:49.345 --> 39:50.763
{\an8}I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO HIM.

39:50.846 --> 39:53.808
{\an8}HE KEPT DOING IT TO ME.

39:53.891 --> 39:57.353
{\an8}SORRY.

40:09.949 --> 40:10.908
{\an8}- MY HOME IS [bleep] JERSEY.
