<i>convicted in 1994</i>

00:02.000 --> 00:03.759
<i>for the murder
of Lizzie Kilmuir.</i>

00:03.760 --> 00:06.429
<i>Drew McColl called in.
His daughter seems to be missing.</i>

00:06.430 --> 00:08.839
<i>They've deployed a major
investigation team.</i>

00:08.840 --> 00:10.749
They arrive first
thing in the morning.

00:10.750 --> 00:13.309
A bunch of people that just
think we knit jumpers up here.

00:13.310 --> 00:16.679
This is a eight-millimetre film
I got transferred.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.599
- Is that your dad, Kevin?
- Aye. That's him.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.379
Alan Killick showed us
some of their home movies.

00:22.380 --> 00:24.539
- You were in it.
- What are these doing on the wall?

00:24.540 --> 00:27.709
If you go anywhere near Molly,
again, anywhere near her,

00:27.710 --> 00:29.300
I will kill you.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.319
Jo, it's me.
It's Alan.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.409
Someone from Bergen
wanting to talk to you

00:35.410 --> 00:37.119
about their Soderland
investigation.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.709
- Hi.
- Lars.

00:38.710 --> 00:41.569
<i>Jo Halley thinks there's
someone outside her croft.</i>

00:41.570 --> 00:43.749
<i>- Again?
- Go and take a wee look, will you?</i>

00:43.750 --> 00:45.199
Jo!

00:45.200 --> 00:47.599
Jesus!
<i>I'm at Jo's croft.</i>

00:47.600 --> 00:50.149
Place has been turned over.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.599
<i>Is Jo OK?</i>

00:51.600 --> 00:52.900
I don't know.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.729
Do you think she's going to be OK?

02:11.640 --> 02:13.440
They'll let us know.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.259
How long between the call
and you getting here?

02:18.260 --> 02:19.749
I don't know.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.779
I got here as quick as I could.

02:21.780 --> 02:23.439
It's not the first time
she's said

02:23.440 --> 02:25.119
there was somebody
on the property.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.850
Yeah, only this time she
was telling the truth.

02:29.660 --> 02:32.859
Well, given as her attacker
tried to strangle her,

02:32.860 --> 02:34.429
I don't think it takes a genius

02:34.430 --> 02:36.830
to see who our person
of interest should be.

02:37.980 --> 02:39.899
It's a mess in there.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.890
Whoever attacked her must have
been looking for something.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.659
You have any luck tracking
down the ex-husband?

02:45.660 --> 02:46.960
No, not yet.

02:48.020 --> 02:49.320
You get on that.

02:50.340 --> 02:51.640
Go to the hospital.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.139
Keep me posted.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.099
I want to know what she says
when she comes round.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.400
OK.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.789
There's nothing you can say

03:01.790 --> 03:04.050
that I haven't already
thought myself.

03:13.740 --> 03:15.700
Alan, you can't go in there.

03:16.180 --> 03:18.490
What's happened?
Is Jo OK?

03:19.460 --> 03:21.420
She was attacked last night.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.739
What...?
Is she all right?

03:25.740 --> 03:27.799
When did you last speak to her?

03:27.800 --> 03:30.290
I don't believe this.
Do you know who did it?

03:31.140 --> 03:34.160
I suggest you go home
and I'll talk to you later.

03:44.820 --> 03:46.619
<i>So how do you want to play this?</i>

03:46.620 --> 03:48.279
<i>Are you going to bring Malone in?</i>

03:48.280 --> 03:49.779
I will.

03:49.780 --> 03:53.609
But I've got an abusive ex-husband
I want to talk to before I do.

03:53.610 --> 03:57.189
Jimmy, the first thing MIT
will do is arrest Malone.

03:57.190 --> 03:59.859
The second, they'll demand
to know why you haven't.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.579
They can think what they like.

04:01.580 --> 04:04.459
But this is different from Lizzie
and it's different from Sally.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.019
Jo was attacked in her own home.

04:06.020 --> 04:07.870
I'm just warning you.

04:08.260 --> 04:09.560
OK.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.659
Alan Killick,

04:13.660 --> 04:16.809
he was at Jo's croft
this morning asking questions

04:16.810 --> 04:18.110
and that bothers me.

04:18.980 --> 04:21.350
Like a bad penny,
that boy.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.319
Jo Halley is the only witness
that we've got who saw Sally

04:56.320 --> 04:59.419
talking to our mystery
Norwegian at the festival.

04:59.420 --> 05:03.249
However, we're going to have to
accept that Jo might have been mistaken

05:03.250 --> 05:07.150
and the person she saw
might have been somebody local.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.309
One thing's for sure, though -

05:10.310 --> 05:12.879
whoever broke in was
looking for something.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.529
What, we don't know.

05:14.530 --> 05:17.679
So I'm going to need you
to knock on every door

05:17.680 --> 05:20.529
between Lerwick and Jo's croft

05:20.530 --> 05:23.839
and I want you to
check every CCTV camera

05:23.840 --> 05:26.419
on Shetland and
then check it again.

05:26.420 --> 05:30.279
Because somebody crossed those
hills to that croft,

05:30.280 --> 05:32.959
attacked Jo and then ran away

05:32.960 --> 05:35.059
and they must
have left a trace somewhere.

05:35.060 --> 05:37.379
Thanks. Sir,
someone by the name of Downing

05:37.380 --> 05:39.889
hired a car from Sumburgh
Airport two days ago.

05:39.890 --> 05:41.339
Could be Jo's ex-husband.

05:41.340 --> 05:44.350
OK, well, if he's still on Shetland,
then we're going to need to talk to him.

05:49.660 --> 05:51.509
Detective Inspector Cole?

05:51.510 --> 05:53.110
- Hello.
- Billy McCabe.

05:54.660 --> 05:56.510
Not much space,
I'm afraid,

05:56.980 --> 06:00.150
but I've designated an interview room as your office.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.009
Thank you.

06:03.010 --> 06:06.349
We will need DI Perez to brief
my team as soon as possible.

06:06.350 --> 06:08.619
We've just got an awful lot to get
through and time's of the essence.

06:08.620 --> 06:09.929
I'm DI Perez.

06:09.930 --> 06:11.550
Welcome to Shetland.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.179
How was your flight?

06:14.180 --> 06:17.179
Well, let's just say I prefer
my planes a little bigger

06:17.180 --> 06:19.560
and my runways a little longer.

06:23.220 --> 06:25.250
They'll wrap this up in no time.

06:27.340 --> 06:30.739
So in both the Kilmuir
and McColl cases,

06:30.740 --> 06:34.179
the victims were found in some
sort of stone cairn, is that right?

06:34.180 --> 06:35.539
Yeah.

06:35.540 --> 06:37.289
But this attack is connected?

06:37.290 --> 06:41.999
Jo Halley is the only witness
that we've got who saw the man

06:42.000 --> 06:45.700
that we believe attacked Sally
McColl after the music festival.

06:46.460 --> 06:49.209
Well, in that case, I'd like to
interview Thomas Malone again.

06:49.210 --> 06:51.299
I know you've already spoken to him

06:51.300 --> 06:53.179
but perhaps we can get more out of him.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.489
Definitely.

06:54.490 --> 06:56.599
We need to put some real pressure on him.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.620
Did you find anything useful
when you searched his farmhouse?

07:02.700 --> 07:04.499
Please tell me you searched his farmhouse.

07:04.500 --> 07:08.409
We have no evidence to link
him to Sally McColl's death.

07:08.410 --> 07:10.599
Apart from a previous
conviction for a similar crime?

07:10.600 --> 07:12.109
That conviction was quashed.

07:12.110 --> 07:14.269
Well, as far as we're concerned,
that original conviction

07:14.270 --> 07:15.650
was evidentially sound.

07:15.990 --> 07:17.949
A mistrial doesn't mean
that he was innocent

07:17.950 --> 07:19.559
and we have to proceed on that basis.

07:19.560 --> 07:23.320
Look, if he feels that
you're targeting him,

07:23.740 --> 07:25.579
then he could react badly.

07:25.580 --> 07:28.169
I'm sorry, am I missing something here?

07:28.170 --> 07:31.180
Or have I stumbled into the
social work department by mistake?

07:33.180 --> 07:35.219
Organise a search, soon as.

07:35.220 --> 07:38.479
I was led to believe that the
McColl case was still ours.

07:38.480 --> 07:42.419
Well, not if they're connected
and, according to your report,

07:42.420 --> 07:44.649
Malone was given a false
alibi by Gail Callahan,

07:44.650 --> 07:46.800
which makes me believe
that they could be.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.700
Thomas Malone!

08:18.060 --> 08:19.619
Open up!

08:19.620 --> 08:21.420
We're police officers.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.360
What's the score with Lars?

08:37.020 --> 08:40.450
Is he here to take a statement
or make a statement?

08:42.940 --> 08:44.539
Very good.

08:44.540 --> 08:47.459
Does seem to have a wee bit of
thing for you, though, doesn't he?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.419
Well, he's only human.

08:49.420 --> 08:53.179
Downing gave the car hire firm the
St Olaf Hill Hotel as an address.

08:53.180 --> 08:55.459
I've got a uniform picking him up now.

08:55.460 --> 08:58.140
- Where you going?
- Away from you.

09:14.900 --> 09:18.449
Mr. Downing, I'm DI Perez,
this is DS Mclntosh.

09:18.450 --> 09:20.209
We'd like to ask you some questions

09:20.210 --> 09:21.710
about your ex-wife Jo Halley.

09:22.140 --> 09:23.959
Has something happened
I should know about?

09:23.960 --> 09:25.479
Why do you ask that?

09:25.480 --> 09:27.899
Because I'm here.
With you.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.750
She's been attacked.

09:30.220 --> 09:32.079
And given your history,

09:32.080 --> 09:34.580
I would like to know
where you were last night.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.179
Is she OK?

09:37.180 --> 09:39.939
- Where were you?
- At the hotel.

09:39.940 --> 09:41.389
And you can verify that?

09:41.390 --> 09:42.699
I think so, I...

09:42.700 --> 09:44.100
I was in the bar at one point.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.659
When was the last
time you saw Jo?

09:47.660 --> 09:50.019
Yesterday.
That's why I'm up here, she...

09:50.020 --> 09:54.619
She asked me to come. She
wanted to see me to apologise.

09:54.620 --> 09:55.929
For what?

09:55.930 --> 09:57.939
For telling a pack of lies about me

09:57.940 --> 09:59.899
and getting me locked up.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.019
She wanted to make amends,
maybe even start over.

10:03.020 --> 10:06.719
Bit of a coincidence that she gets attacked
just after you arrive on Shetland, though?

10:06.720 --> 10:08.950
I know what you're thinking,
but it wasn't me.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.699
Well, I'm going to keep you
in custody until Jo regains

10:11.700 --> 10:15.459
consciousness and she can identify
the man that tried to kill her.

10:15.460 --> 10:18.210
- I've got a flight booked.
- Well, you'll have to change it.

10:19.260 --> 10:21.299
This is crazy,
I didn't touch her.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.690
You know what?

10:23.740 --> 10:25.500
I don't believe you.

10:27.980 --> 10:29.280
Convince me.

10:32.020 --> 10:35.539
I... I did hit her
when we were together.

10:35.540 --> 10:38.440
But I went to counselling in
prison. I've turned my life around.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.979
I came up here to find
her, not to hurt her, but

10:42.980 --> 10:45.139
to see if she'd take me back.

10:45.140 --> 10:47.419
She isn't interested, so I left.

10:47.420 --> 10:50.950
OK, so you've already lied to me,

10:51.580 --> 10:53.859
so why should I believe you now?

10:53.860 --> 10:55.859
I'd be fool to lay a hand
on her again, I know that.

10:55.860 --> 10:57.819
Well, maybe you just can't help yourself.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.930
As I see it, I don't have a choice.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.619
I can't go back inside. I...

11:03.620 --> 11:05.620
I couldn't survive that again.

11:08.030 --> 11:11.380
I never laid a hand on her.
That's the God's honest truth.

11:17.220 --> 11:18.619
Malone's gone.

11:18.620 --> 11:19.939
His place is empty.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.219
Do you have any idea where he could be?

11:22.220 --> 11:25.379
- Is his medication still there?
- I'll check.

11:25.380 --> 11:28.219
If that's gone, then he's planning
to leave the island.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.530
If not...

11:30.580 --> 11:32.679
.. he could just be out walking.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.990
Where?
Back to happiness?

11:36.660 --> 11:39.099
Or he may have tried to harm himself.

11:39.100 --> 11:42.330
Yes, well, either way,
we still need to find him.

11:42.780 --> 11:44.680
We can't risk another attack.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.219
You know he's playing you,
don't you?

11:49.220 --> 11:50.579
And it's working.

11:50.580 --> 11:52.959
You're looking at everyone
else apart from him.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.180
Then you're making the same
mistake that Drew McColl did.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.210
Donna Killick can't account for
Alan's movements last night.

12:05.740 --> 12:09.680
OK...
don't let Downing go anywhere.

12:10.780 --> 12:12.690
I'll be back in half an hour.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.290
<i>Been looking for you.</i>

12:23.060 --> 12:25.010
What happened? Why didn't
you come in this morning?

12:25.700 --> 12:27.319
You know why.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.149
I don't want to cause any problem
between you and your mum.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.219
She was the same with Sally.

12:32.220 --> 12:35.259
She's just really possessive.

12:35.260 --> 12:37.299
Pushed her away.
Sally hated it.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.370
Anyway, it's not just up to her.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.720
We run the place now.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.539
Sally had a point.

12:44.540 --> 12:46.939
Nobody wants to be somewhere
they're not wanted.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.240
You are wanted.

12:51.660 --> 12:54.410
I couldn't have handled
any of this without you.

12:58.660 --> 13:00.299
You know, I better go.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.499
Just come back
to the sanctuary full time.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.259
And I'll deal with my mum.

13:05.260 --> 13:07.300
Just think about it,
please.

13:17.300 --> 13:20.530
What do you want, Dad? I don't
appreciate being followed.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.580
It's not you I want to
talk to, Cassie, it's Alan.

13:32.740 --> 13:35.329
You're going to need to account
for your movements last night

13:35.330 --> 13:37.259
and I don't want any
mistakes this time.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.939
I went to see Jo and then I changed
my mind and I went down to the beach.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.669
Which beach would that be?

13:41.670 --> 13:43.380
The one by the sanctuary.

13:43.780 --> 13:45.139
Alone?

13:45.140 --> 13:46.490
That's right.

13:47.140 --> 13:49.019
- See anybody?
- No.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.139
Nobody walking their dog, nothing?

13:51.140 --> 13:52.460
Deserted.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.799
Why did you change your
mind about going to Jo's?

13:57.800 --> 14:00.200
It was late, I didn't want
to give her a fright again.

14:02.460 --> 14:04.160
What do you mean again?

14:04.900 --> 14:07.070
I went up see her before...

14:08.540 --> 14:11.059
.. cos I wanted to get
some of Sally's stuff, and

14:11.060 --> 14:12.759
I gave her a fright.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.760
Why did you come
to Jo's this morning?

14:15.140 --> 14:17.940
I was going to ask her if she
wanted to get some breakfast.

14:25.980 --> 14:28.799
What's your relationship with Jo exactly?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.459
Just friends.

14:30.460 --> 14:32.230
Why are you asking me this?

14:35.420 --> 14:37.439
I just thought that under the
circumstances

14:37.440 --> 14:40.600
you and I should get to know
each other a wee bit better.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.110
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.219
See if you're using my
daughter as a shield,

14:50.220 --> 14:52.419
see if anything happens to her,

14:52.420 --> 14:56.499
I'll take you apart bit by bit.
Do we understand each other?

14:56.500 --> 14:57.800
Yeah.

14:58.780 --> 15:00.080
What?

15:01.460 --> 15:02.760
Yeah.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.159
You need to come into the station
to make a statement,

15:07.160 --> 15:08.460
so arrange a time.

15:21.140 --> 15:22.540
It's my job.

15:32.980 --> 15:35.570
So, I wrote up your
statement in Norwegian.

15:36.020 --> 15:37.999
I can read it over
with you if you'd like.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.010
- I trust you.
- All right.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.119
.. so I just need
your signature -

15:43.120 --> 15:44.700
right here.
Right?

15:45.620 --> 15:47.459
So how's your witness doing?

15:47.460 --> 15:50.820
Not sure. She hasn't
regained consciousness yet.

15:52.620 --> 15:54.899
I suppose you're
too busy for lunch.

15:54.900 --> 15:57.600
- Sorry.
- Yeah. I understand.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.299
So any idea who attacked her yet?

16:00.300 --> 16:03.280
Well, it wasn't Soderland,
we know that.

16:03.860 --> 16:07.139
She made up this whole thing
with the Norwegian guy.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.180
What makes you say that?

16:09.780 --> 16:12.629
I don't know. Just from the way
you've been talking about her,

16:12.630 --> 16:14.560
she sounds a little bit crazy.

16:28.460 --> 16:30.179
Billy.

16:30.180 --> 16:33.259
Hillhead Road isn't
still closed off, is it?

16:33.260 --> 16:34.659
What?

16:34.660 --> 16:38.699
Hillhead Road. Lars said
it was closed for roadworks.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.520
That was last week.

16:54.740 --> 16:56.419
- Hi, Graeme.
- Hi, Tosh.

16:56.420 --> 16:59.459
I need to know if any of
your drivers picked this man

16:59.460 --> 17:01.750
up from the airport on the 28th.

17:04.020 --> 17:07.269
The only way Lars would know
that Hillhead Road was closed

17:07.270 --> 17:09.459
last week
is if he was here.

17:09.460 --> 17:12.009
And one of the drivers thinks
he picked him up from the ferry

17:12.010 --> 17:13.960
on the day of the festival.

17:15.619 --> 17:18.619
I had a feeling about him
when we were in Norway.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.760
Well,
why didn't you say something?

17:22.940 --> 17:25.050
I didn't trust my own judgment.

17:30.660 --> 17:31.960
I do.

17:32.820 --> 17:34.380
I trust your judgment.

17:36.820 --> 17:39.450
So the next time, say something, OK?

17:40.180 --> 17:41.480
OK.

17:46.100 --> 17:49.119
<i>I need some information on Lars Bleymann.</i>

17:49.120 --> 17:51.570
<i>- Why?
- I just need to verify some dates.</i>

17:52.340 --> 17:53.899
I don't understand.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.070
Well, look, I mean, it's probably nothing.

17:56.420 --> 17:59.219
I just need to know
if Lars was on leave

17:59.220 --> 18:01.809
on the 28th of last month.

18:01.810 --> 18:03.179
The reason for this?

18:03.180 --> 18:04.949
<i>We have a report...</i>

18:04.950 --> 18:07.760
<i>saying that he was on
Shetland on that day.</i>

18:08.540 --> 18:10.659
Why would Lars be on Shetland?

18:10.660 --> 18:14.010
Well, that's what we're
trying to establish.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.739
Well, I can tell you the dates myself.

18:19.740 --> 18:21.529
He took two weeks' leave

18:21.530 --> 18:23.700
to spend time with
his grandfather...

18:25.710 --> 18:27.779
The 1st was his first day back.

18:27.780 --> 18:29.979
<i>Are you saying you think
Lars is your Norwegian?</i>

18:29.980 --> 18:31.410
I don't know.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.190
But I know he's lying.

18:37.820 --> 18:40.859
Billy, is Detective
Bleymann still here?

18:40.860 --> 18:42.629
I thought he was waiting to
take a statement from you,

18:42.630 --> 18:45.589
but he left a while ago -
must've gone to the airport.

18:45.590 --> 18:47.279
Right, make sure he doesn't
get on that Bergen flight

18:47.280 --> 18:48.880
cos we need to talk to him.

18:59.580 --> 19:01.160
You're all right, Jo.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.380
You're safe now.

19:06.580 --> 19:07.880
Jo...

19:08.820 --> 19:11.550
.. can you remember who did this to you?

19:13.980 --> 19:16.170
Was it Thomas Malone?

19:17.700 --> 19:19.560
Was it your ex-husband?

19:23.620 --> 19:25.380
I'll fetch someone.

19:46.860 --> 19:50.459
This is the CCTV footage
of Sally at Bergen Airport.

19:50.460 --> 19:53.750
I just wanted to look at it again
cos Lars kept asking about it.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.159
See, she talks to this
woman in the red jacket.

19:57.160 --> 19:59.259
He seemed to want to know who she was.

19:59.260 --> 20:01.040
Stop, rewind.

20:03.980 --> 20:07.330
There. Does she...
Does she give her something?

20:17.140 --> 20:22.019
Bring up the CCTV footage
of Sally at Sumburgh

20:22.020 --> 20:24.369
before she goes to Norway.

20:24.370 --> 20:26.699
She parks her car, locks
it and heads inside.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.759
She doesn't call anyone
or speak to anyone.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.979
- It's the same on her way back.
- Here. Here, stop.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.899
Zoom in there.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.659
Freeze it.

20:34.660 --> 20:36.950
Right, now show me the footage

20:37.500 --> 20:40.580
of her opening the car
when she comes back.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.450
- What am I missing?
- There.

20:46.980 --> 20:49.759
See, there's something
on the key ring.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.249
It wasn't there when she left and
it's there when she came back.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.170
That's the thing the
woman gave her in Bergen

21:20.700 --> 21:22.480
It's a memory stick.

21:39.940 --> 21:41.819
Holiday snaps?

21:41.820 --> 21:43.220
See what's in the other file.

21:47.980 --> 21:49.979
That's the NDA office in Bergen.

21:49.980 --> 21:51.539
Sally must have filmed this.

21:51.540 --> 21:54.490
Looks like a meeting with
different far-right groups.

21:56.740 --> 21:58.220
There's Soderland.

22:04.600 --> 22:07.100
<i>Tordenskjold!</i>

22:07.510 --> 22:10.890
<i>Tordenskjold!</i>

22:24.500 --> 22:26.099
You OK?

22:26.100 --> 22:27.400
Yeah.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.269
What...
What are you doing in here?

22:46.270 --> 22:48.070
You're not allowed in there.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.760
Stay with Jo.
Hey!

23:05.180 --> 23:06.639
Tosh.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.899
Detective Bleymann <i>has
just run out of the hospital.</i>

23:08.900 --> 23:11.359
<i>- What's going on?</i>
- Look, he's involved, Sandy,

23:11.360 --> 23:13.979
I'm not sure how,
but if he comes back, detain him.

23:13.980 --> 23:16.459
Billy. There's only one
way off the island for him,

23:16.460 --> 23:18.169
so get them to hold the ferry.

23:18.170 --> 23:19.559
Get Sandy down at the terminal,

23:19.560 --> 23:21.889
but tell him to leave a uniform
at the hospital.

23:21.890 --> 23:23.290
Tosh, let's go.

23:42.740 --> 23:44.579
Thank you.

23:44.580 --> 23:45.880
Hi.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.709
Got a sighting of him at the terminal.

24:06.710 --> 24:08.559
Armed response are on
their way from Lossiemouth,

24:08.560 --> 24:10.200
they'll be at least 30 minutes.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.649
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, on
behalf of NorthLink Ferries,</i>

25:43.650 --> 25:46.899
<i>I'd like to apologise for the delay
of the departure from Lerwick.</i>

25:46.900 --> 25:49.519
<i>We will keep you informed of any updates.</i>

25:49.520 --> 25:51.579
<i>Tosh, any sign of him?</i>

25:51.580 --> 25:52.909
He's not up here.

25:52.910 --> 25:54.350
Try the lounge.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.509
Sir!

26:25.510 --> 26:27.329
They don't want to hold
the ferry much longer.

26:27.330 --> 26:28.639
Well, they'll have to wait.
Just keep looking,

26:28.640 --> 26:30.090
he's here somewhere.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.780
That'll be great, actually -
I just want to go and check.

27:29.220 --> 27:31.140
<i>Yeah,
I'll just see if I have it here.</i>

27:42.940 --> 27:44.450
That's my car!

27:50.060 --> 27:51.560
Stay where you are.

28:00.140 --> 28:02.219
Tosh.
He's on the car deck.

28:02.220 --> 28:04.719
There's been a crash with a police car.

28:04.720 --> 28:07.299
He's going towards passenger
deck. Block the stairs!

28:07.300 --> 28:08.890
<i>- Block the stairs!</i>
- Will do.

28:14.940 --> 28:16.300
Lars, stop!

28:21.950 --> 28:23.259
Move out of the way, Tosh.

28:23.260 --> 28:24.619
- Lars!
- Stop right there.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.219
Lars, don't.

28:26.220 --> 28:29.379
We've seen the footage, we know
you're involved with the NDA.

28:29.380 --> 28:30.680
Put the knife down.

28:32.500 --> 28:33.899
There's nowhere to go, Lars.

28:33.900 --> 28:36.100
She's right, Lars. Put
the knife down, it's over.

28:40.700 --> 28:42.390
It's over, Lars.

28:46.460 --> 28:48.060
All right.

28:52.580 --> 28:54.619
Holy shit.

28:54.620 --> 28:56.840
Fy hell in hell!

29:06.100 --> 29:07.420
Thomas Malone.

29:13.780 --> 29:16.059
I'd like you to come with me, please.

29:16.060 --> 29:17.920
No. No. No.

29:19.940 --> 29:21.500
No! No!

29:27.020 --> 29:29.619
You're saying this is the man
who killed Sally McColl?

29:29.620 --> 29:31.270
No. I'm saying it's possible.

29:32.260 --> 29:35.180
He's a clandestine member of the NDA.

29:36.060 --> 29:40.279
I'm assuming that Sally filmed
him at a meeting in Bergen

29:40.280 --> 29:43.880
and he came over here to try
to retrieve the evidence.

29:44.780 --> 29:47.739
He stole her phone,
they argued...

29:47.740 --> 29:49.379
And he killed her?

29:49.380 --> 29:51.419
Making it look
like Malone did it.

29:51.420 --> 29:53.919
It's possible that he
could've read up on the case

29:53.920 --> 29:56.129
- while he was here.
- I'm not buying it.

29:56.130 --> 29:59.510
Malone has a stronger motive -
revenge.

30:00.300 --> 30:03.360
- And Jo Halley?
- Well, when Tosh went to Bergen,

30:04.340 --> 30:08.610
I think it alerted him to the fact
that he'd been spotted at the festival,

30:09.260 --> 30:13.059
so he then knew that Jo Halley
could identify him at some point.

30:13.060 --> 30:16.809
I also believe
that he told the NDA

30:16.810 --> 30:19.059
that Mathias Soderland
was an informer,

30:19.060 --> 30:21.619
which lead directly
to him being killed.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.179
Well, if you're right,

30:23.180 --> 30:26.759
what's so important about that NDA footage

30:26.760 --> 30:29.450
that Jo and Sally
had to be silenced?

30:44.260 --> 30:46.739
Interview with
Detective Bleymann,

30:46.740 --> 30:49.019
commencing 2:56.

30:49.020 --> 30:52.260
- Present are DI Perez.
- And DS Mclntosh.

30:53.660 --> 30:57.059
Detective Bleymann, you've been
detained on suspicion of murder

30:57.060 --> 30:58.699
and attempted murder.

30:58.700 --> 31:01.909
You don't need to answer any questions
other than giving your name,

31:01.910 --> 31:04.819
address, date and place
of birth and nationality

31:04.820 --> 31:07.059
and you have the right to
have a solicitor present.

31:07.060 --> 31:08.909
Your initial detainment
time is 12 hours but this...

31:08.910 --> 31:12.300
- I know this.
- .. can be extended to 24 hours.

31:18.660 --> 31:22.650
I would like you to tell me why you
were at the Shetland Folk Festival.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.800
No comment.

31:27.420 --> 31:29.620
Did you meet Sally McColl there?

31:30.430 --> 31:31.739
No comment.

31:31.740 --> 31:33.040
Or Jo Halley?

31:33.780 --> 31:35.080
No comment.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.680
You tried to distract us

31:39.660 --> 31:41.839
with the CCTV footage

31:41.840 --> 31:44.950
of Sally meeting a
woman in Bergen Airport.

31:46.100 --> 31:48.220
Well,
that backfired on you...

31:49.100 --> 31:52.939
.. because we now know that Sally
filmed you at an NDA meeting

31:52.940 --> 31:55.039
of far-right groups.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.100
And then you traced her back here

31:57.940 --> 32:01.170
and then you killed her, and
I would like to know why.

32:02.060 --> 32:03.660
No comment.

32:04.660 --> 32:07.790
You know, saying "no comment" is
not going to make this go away.

32:08.340 --> 32:10.459
No comment.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.339
You didn't want anyone to
know you were part of the NDA.

32:13.340 --> 32:15.419
You'd lose your job,
I get that.

32:15.420 --> 32:17.850
But to kill Sally because of it?

32:18.460 --> 32:22.450
Yeah, I don't think it was just
about protecting your identity,
was it?

32:24.820 --> 32:29.230
There was something else
that you were trying to hide.

32:29.580 --> 32:33.950
Now, you told the NDA that
Mathias Soderland was an informer.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.640
What were you trying to protect?

32:38.420 --> 32:39.720
My country.

32:42.580 --> 32:43.880
Your country?

32:45.060 --> 32:47.890
Sorry, what threat was Sally
McColl to your country?

32:48.500 --> 32:51.739
All I am trying to do
is keep people safe.

32:51.740 --> 32:53.939
By killing them? Sorry, you've
lost me a wee bit there.

32:53.940 --> 32:55.619
By preserving our way of life.

32:55.620 --> 32:57.429
OK,
let me ask you again,

32:57.430 --> 33:00.819
what threat was Sally
McColl to your country?

33:00.820 --> 33:03.019
This is not the question
you should be asking.

33:03.020 --> 33:06.059
We know that the NDA are
planning attacks of some kind.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.710
Is that what this is about?

33:08.620 --> 33:11.540
I'm sure it's probably
some kind of soft target.

33:11.940 --> 33:14.759
Young people, defenceless children,

33:14.760 --> 33:17.300
women -
nothing too dangerous.

33:17.780 --> 33:19.080
Cowardly.

33:21.580 --> 33:22.940
Like Utoya.

33:24.700 --> 33:27.960
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.700
Anders Breivik
was not a coward.

33:32.340 --> 33:34.480
He should be considered a hero.

33:38.020 --> 33:39.320
Aye...

33:40.540 --> 33:44.169
Your idea of a hero and mine
are very, very different.

33:44.170 --> 33:45.979
Well, he fought for what
he believed in, didn't he?

33:45.980 --> 33:48.179
Oh, is that what you were
doing when you murdered Sally

33:48.180 --> 33:49.489
and tried to kill Jo?

33:49.490 --> 33:51.790
It took courage to do what he did.

33:52.100 --> 33:55.059
He's what people who love their
country should aspire to be.

33:55.060 --> 33:56.659
Oh, really?

33:56.660 --> 34:00.219
A pathetic child killer

34:00.220 --> 34:02.999
who lived with his mum?

34:03.000 --> 34:04.979
He lived with his mum!

34:04.980 --> 34:07.099
We need to look
after our own first.

34:07.100 --> 34:10.059
Before we try to save everyone else.

34:10.060 --> 34:12.219
No more foreigners.

34:12.219 --> 34:14.199
Why should we trust them?

34:14.199 --> 34:17.310
Our race is being destroyed.

34:17.659 --> 34:19.819
Our blood is being diluted.

34:19.820 --> 34:23.899
They... they marry our
women, they pollute our genes.

34:23.900 --> 34:26.400
We will disappear if we don't act now.

34:28.020 --> 34:31.059
And I thought that you
would understand that.

34:31.060 --> 34:33.299
Aren't you proud of
your Shetland heritage?

34:33.300 --> 34:35.239
Don't you want to live
with your own people?

34:35.239 --> 34:36.540
Yes, I do.

34:38.300 --> 34:42.860
But, you see, the thing is
my blood's already diluted.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.620
Clue's in the name.

34:49.540 --> 34:51.440
All right, Perez.

34:53.260 --> 34:55.670
Then why don't you tell your happy family

34:56.100 --> 34:59.860
that we are going to kill even
more than Anders Breivik did?

35:14.340 --> 35:15.640
Tosh.

35:27.940 --> 35:30.299
We have to get some
idea what the target is.

35:30.300 --> 35:32.559
He will stall us till they do
whatever they plan to do.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.949
I got the footage translated

35:33.950 --> 35:36.409
but you can't really make
out what they're saying.

35:36.410 --> 35:38.859
"Tordenskjold"
is mentioned a few times.

35:38.860 --> 35:41.459
Now, I think it's a reference
to Peter Tordenskjold,

35:41.460 --> 35:43.139
he was a Norwegian naval hero.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.079
His face is on everything in Norway -

35:45.080 --> 35:48.230
matches, bank notes, stamps.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.550
Is it on any buildings?

35:51.140 --> 35:54.240
Hospitals, schools, something
that could be a target?

36:02.620 --> 36:06.899
The Norwegian government is using
a ferry - the Tordenskjold -

36:06.900 --> 36:08.739
to house migrants.

36:08.740 --> 36:10.180
How many people are on it?

36:11.540 --> 36:14.499
400.
Mostly from Syria.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.509
OK, well, this might
already be on their radar,

36:16.510 --> 36:18.290
but let you better
let Bergen know.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.560
Tosh.

36:24.180 --> 36:27.200
Are there any other Norwegian heroes
you want to talk to me about, Lars?

36:27.900 --> 36:30.259
Peter Tordenskjold, for example.

36:30.260 --> 36:32.719
I suppose if you were looking
for a symbolic attack,

36:32.720 --> 36:35.509
then a ship housing desperate refugees

36:35.510 --> 36:36.969
would probably do the trick,
wouldn't it?

36:36.970 --> 36:40.709
Especially a ship named after a
great Norwegian hero like that.

36:40.710 --> 36:43.439
I mean, that must be quite a
kick in the teeth for the NDA.

36:43.440 --> 36:45.719
Using a ship like that for those people?

36:45.720 --> 36:48.489
What were you going to do? Were
you just going to walk on board

36:48.490 --> 36:50.339
and start shooting women and children?

36:50.340 --> 36:52.899
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:52.900 --> 36:54.259
Yes, you do.

36:54.260 --> 36:56.690
Cos that's why you came back after Sally.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.290
Cos what she filmed

36:59.600 --> 37:02.339
was you making plans to
attack the Tordenskjold.

37:02.340 --> 37:04.619
It's not going to happen, Lars.

37:04.620 --> 37:07.989
Not now. So you might as
well tell us the truth.

37:07.990 --> 37:12.259
Well, even if I did, there is
not much you can do about it.

37:12.260 --> 37:13.560
Is there?

37:18.500 --> 37:21.250
Take your hands off me!
No!

37:31.140 --> 37:32.879
Calm down, Thomas.

37:32.880 --> 37:34.999
We just want to ask you a few questions

37:35.000 --> 37:37.100
about the night Sally went missing.

37:37.620 --> 37:40.220
Maybe we should have Perez in here, too.

37:44.780 --> 37:47.259
So you were at this music
festival, is that right?

37:47.260 --> 37:49.529
And in your statement
to DI Perez,

37:49.530 --> 37:52.039
it says you went home
and called Gail Callahan.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.619
- Why?
- I was upset.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.429
- You were upset?
- Aye.

37:56.430 --> 37:57.880
Why were you upset?

37:58.500 --> 38:00.459
Cos people were...

38:00.460 --> 38:02.259
They were watching me.

38:02.260 --> 38:03.750
Because...?

38:06.900 --> 38:10.809
Because they knew who I was.

38:10.810 --> 38:13.469
Gail Callahan says that you
were on the phone to her

38:13.470 --> 38:14.919
all night
but...

38:14.920 --> 38:17.770
well, our phone records
show that not to be true.

38:19.740 --> 38:21.459
What's that to do with me?

38:21.460 --> 38:24.529
Well, there's a gap between
the end of the music festival

38:24.530 --> 38:26.540
and that phone call being made.

38:27.780 --> 38:29.760
Where were you
at the time in between?

38:37.380 --> 38:38.680
Was walking.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.910
Thomas, I'm going to
need better than that.

38:44.900 --> 38:46.200
No.

38:47.580 --> 38:50.050
I was just walking.

38:52.740 --> 38:54.699
Do you want to know what I think?

38:54.700 --> 38:56.099
No.

38:56.100 --> 38:59.880
I think that Gail
Callahan was protecting you

39:01.660 --> 39:03.799
because she thinks you
do have something to do

39:03.800 --> 39:05.450
with the death of Sally McColl.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.379
No way.

39:10.380 --> 39:14.459
Just like your own mother thought
that you killed Lizzie Kilmuir.

39:14.460 --> 39:19.300
You are aware, Thomas, that double jeopardy
doesn't exist in Scotland any more?

39:21.380 --> 39:24.219
So if I find out that
you're in any way involved

39:24.220 --> 39:25.799
in these new crimes,

39:25.800 --> 39:27.989
you'll be prosecuted
a second time

39:27.990 --> 39:29.910
for the murder
of Lizzie Kilmuir.

39:34.340 --> 39:35.930
I'll see you later.

39:46.940 --> 39:50.899
The NDA are claiming Lars
has nothing to do with them.

39:50.900 --> 39:53.799
Not according to the
video that Sally took.

39:53.800 --> 39:56.299
I'm not sure we have enough to charge him.

39:56.300 --> 39:58.389
There's no physical evidence.

39:58.390 --> 40:01.140
We're going to have to wait for
forensics to come back on Jo's clothing.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.680
This guy's going nowhere.

40:04.620 --> 40:07.050
He is extremely dangerous.

40:08.100 --> 40:11.739
The Norwegians are going to have
to start taking this seriously.

40:11.740 --> 40:15.300
Just thought you'd like to know,
they've got Malone in a cell,

40:15.610 --> 40:18.519
trying to find out where he went
on the night that Sally died.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.450
And he's not a happy bunny.

40:46.420 --> 40:50.240
You said that if I told the truth...

40:51.620 --> 40:54.189
- .. I was going to be OK.
- Yes, I did.

40:54.190 --> 40:56.540
Well, they're going to
put me on trial again...

40:56.900 --> 40:59.190
.. for the killing of Lizzie Kilmuir!

41:01.180 --> 41:02.819
- They said that.
- Who said that?

41:02.820 --> 41:05.820
Them!
They said that.

41:10.540 --> 41:13.559
This is because another young
woman was attacked last night.

41:13.560 --> 41:15.170
OK, well...

41:16.220 --> 41:18.499
That's bad news for me, then.

41:18.500 --> 41:21.190
Name's Jo Halley.
Used to live with Sally McColl.

41:24.100 --> 41:25.400
OK, Thomas.

41:27.140 --> 41:29.019
You're a smart guy.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.439
You hide it really well,
but you're far fae stupid,

41:31.440 --> 41:33.589
so I'm going to be straight with you.

41:33.590 --> 41:35.539
You're not being paranoid -

41:35.540 --> 41:37.250
they are out to get you.

41:37.900 --> 41:40.839
And unless you start giving
them some straight answers,

41:40.840 --> 41:44.300
they're going to find a way to
charge you with Sally's death.

41:45.900 --> 41:47.569
What do you want from me?

41:47.570 --> 41:49.670
What do you want from me?!

41:50.100 --> 41:51.950
Another confession?

41:52.380 --> 41:55.919
I didnae kill Lizzie, or Sally, OK?

41:55.920 --> 41:59.339
And it's not my fault that
you don't know who did.

41:59.340 --> 42:01.179
And it's not my fault

42:01.180 --> 42:04.269
that Gail Callahan
gave you a false alibi

42:04.270 --> 42:06.259
for the night Sally went missing,

42:06.260 --> 42:10.249
so why won't you let yourself off
the hook and tell me where you went?

42:10.250 --> 42:12.009
That's my business.

42:12.010 --> 42:13.499
Mine.

42:13.500 --> 42:17.940
Hey! Nobody needs to
know anything about me.

42:20.180 --> 42:21.990
Cos I'm a free man.

42:22.580 --> 42:24.280
Be smart, Thomas...

42:25.860 --> 42:27.620
.. be smarter...

42:28.660 --> 42:31.010
.. and tell me where you went.

42:47.460 --> 42:49.940
Same place as I went to last night.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.040
To the cliffs.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.580
And I stood there.

43:10.540 --> 43:11.840
And I thought...

43:15.420 --> 43:17.970
.."Maybe I'll just fly away."

43:25.020 --> 43:27.760
Just let myself go and fly.

43:37.580 --> 43:38.880
But I want to live.

43:45.340 --> 43:46.780
I deserve...

43:49.620 --> 43:50.920
.. to live.

44:02.820 --> 44:04.120
OK.

44:09.300 --> 44:10.600
Billy.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.499
Release Thomas Malone.

44:13.500 --> 44:15.379
I'll take the flak.

44:15.380 --> 44:17.990
Exactly what did you achieve in there?

44:18.660 --> 44:22.099
That guy is like a time
bomb waiting to go off

44:22.100 --> 44:24.330
and you might just
have lit the fuse.

44:24.680 --> 44:27.959
I'm sorry. I'll take some classes
in pussyfooting around once I find out

44:27.960 --> 44:29.819
who killed Lizzie and Sally.

44:29.820 --> 44:32.669
The assistant chief constable
sent you up here

44:32.670 --> 44:34.320
to cover her arse.

44:34.700 --> 44:36.450
And we both know it.

44:38.550 --> 44:40.209
Interview with Detective
Bleymann

44:40.210 --> 44:43.850
recommences at 5:35
with DI Perez and DS Mclntosh.

44:46.380 --> 44:48.650
Well,
the refugees are safe.

44:50.380 --> 44:53.850
And your friends at the NDA
are under investigation.

44:56.140 --> 44:57.939
You're lying.

44:57.940 --> 45:00.759
Well, somebody in this
room is, but it's not us.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.590
You're a police officer.

45:03.180 --> 45:05.100
People trusted you.

45:06.260 --> 45:08.250
I trusted you.

45:08.940 --> 45:11.899
- Don't you feel any shame at all?
- Why?

45:11.900 --> 45:13.739
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

45:13.740 --> 45:16.260
Well, then turn around and look at us.

45:33.180 --> 45:36.250
You're not even half as
smart as you think you are.

45:36.860 --> 45:39.259
Now, stop insulting my intelligence

45:39.260 --> 45:42.199
and tell us the truth about Sally McColl.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.819
I only came here for the footage.

45:44.820 --> 45:46.839
That's all.
I broke into her car,

45:46.840 --> 45:48.579
I stole her laptop
and took her phone.

45:48.580 --> 45:50.179
These things I did.

45:50.180 --> 45:51.780
But then I left.

45:52.180 --> 45:55.259
I had what I needed.
I never touched Sally McColl.

45:55.260 --> 45:56.599
You're lying.

45:56.600 --> 46:00.229
You killed Sally and then
you came back to make sure

46:00.230 --> 46:02.219
that Jo couldn't identify you.

46:02.220 --> 46:04.120
You came back to kill her.

46:05.060 --> 46:07.929
- I wasn't going to kill her.
- Seriously?

46:07.930 --> 46:10.580
You beat her
and tried to strangle her.

46:11.320 --> 46:14.089
If it wasn't for one of our
officers, she'd be dead now.

46:14.090 --> 46:17.259
Yeah, I just needed to make sure
that she didn't have the footage.

46:17.260 --> 46:19.269
But then she started
screaming and kicking.

46:19.270 --> 46:21.049
What was I supposed to do?

46:21.050 --> 46:23.759
Well, then why would you go to the
hospital if it wasn't to finish her off?

46:23.760 --> 46:25.359
Or was that a lie as well?

46:25.360 --> 46:26.660
Was it?

46:29.340 --> 46:31.230
I just had to talk to her.

46:31.780 --> 46:34.879
- I just had to make sure...
- You really expect us to believe that?

46:34.880 --> 46:36.180
Well, it's the truth.

46:38.860 --> 46:40.160
Lars...

46:41.620 --> 46:43.400
.. this is your last chance.

46:46.100 --> 46:48.050
Did you kill Sally McColl?

46:50.140 --> 46:51.440
No.

46:53.020 --> 46:54.339
The last I saw of her,

46:54.340 --> 46:57.659
she was arguing with an
older man at the festival.

46:57.660 --> 47:01.659
You know... perhaps you should
be talking with him right now,

47:01.660 --> 47:02.960
instead of me.

47:04.060 --> 47:05.579
An older man?

47:05.580 --> 47:06.880
Yes.

47:16.780 --> 47:18.080
This man?

47:20.700 --> 47:22.000
No.

47:24.300 --> 47:26.700
Well, would you recognise
him if you saw him again?

47:29.220 --> 47:30.520
Yeah, sure.

47:32.540 --> 47:34.550
That's him right there, next to you.

47:38.470 --> 47:39.779
This man here?

47:39.780 --> 47:42.099
Yes.
That man.

47:42.100 --> 47:44.690
That's the man I saw talking to Sally.

47:49.340 --> 47:51.430
You don't believe him,
do you?

47:51.780 --> 47:54.219
Mr. Trustworthy in there?
He's a lying ratbag.

47:54.220 --> 47:55.620
He'll say anything.

47:56.620 --> 47:59.100
Duncan's hiding something, Tosh.

48:01.780 --> 48:04.339
I knew when I saw
Alan's home movie

48:04.340 --> 48:07.129
that he knew Lizzie a lot
better than he was letting on.

48:07.130 --> 48:09.539
What's that got to do with
him arguing with Sally?

48:09.540 --> 48:10.849
Not sure.

48:10.850 --> 48:13.700
Why didn't he tell me that
he spoke to her that night?

48:29.420 --> 48:31.059
Hi.

48:31.060 --> 48:32.619
It's Alan, isn't it?

48:32.620 --> 48:33.929
That's right.

48:33.930 --> 48:36.029
If you're looking for
Cass she's not here.

48:36.030 --> 48:38.810
Aye... No, it was you I
came to see, actually.

48:40.620 --> 48:42.370
I wanted to ask you a favour.

48:44.740 --> 48:49.559
Would you mind withdrawing your
offer of a full-time job for Cass?

48:49.560 --> 48:50.860
Why?

48:51.380 --> 48:53.870
I want her to come and
work with me for a bit.

48:54.220 --> 48:56.980
Keep her where I can see her,
you know.

48:57.540 --> 48:59.710
Just till she gets over this break-up.

49:00.220 --> 49:01.820
Is that not up to her?

49:02.740 --> 49:04.980
Well, in normal circumstances, aye.

49:06.220 --> 49:07.980
What do you mean by that?

49:09.620 --> 49:10.929
Well...

49:10.930 --> 49:15.080
Cass is a bit
vulnerable just now, Alan, and...

49:15.980 --> 49:18.239
.. I don't want her getting
dragged into whatever's

49:18.240 --> 49:21.819
going on in your life.
I don't mean that to sound heartless,

49:21.820 --> 49:23.829
but I'm just trying to look
after my daughter, you know.

49:23.830 --> 49:25.139
That's funny.

49:25.140 --> 49:26.999
I thought Jimmy Perez
was her father.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.810
Well, she's, er... She's lucky,
she's got two for the price of one.

49:31.460 --> 49:33.939
I'm not just thinking about
her. I'm thinking about you, too.

49:33.940 --> 49:36.590
I'm sure this is the last thing
you need, don't you think?

49:37.060 --> 49:39.619
Well, I'm touched.
Thanks for your concern.

49:39.620 --> 49:41.829
I'm not saying withdraw the
offer of a job completely,

49:41.830 --> 49:43.189
just until things calm down,

49:43.190 --> 49:45.490
till we know what
happened to Sally and Jo.

49:47.700 --> 49:49.860
You think I killed my
girlfriend, don't you?

49:50.620 --> 49:52.659
Have you got any proof?

49:52.660 --> 49:54.210
No?

49:54.760 --> 49:56.810
Well, I suggest you keep
your mouth shut.

50:11.100 --> 50:12.960
What did Duncan Hunter want?

50:16.220 --> 50:19.640
He's getting on at me for
offering Cass a full-time job.

50:36.020 --> 50:37.379
Hey, what's up?

50:37.380 --> 50:40.550
Did you speak to Sally McColl
the night she disappeared?

50:41.500 --> 50:44.599
I might've said a quick
hello at the festival.

50:44.600 --> 50:47.980
I've got a witness that said
that he saw you arguing with her.

50:52.820 --> 50:55.799
I...
offered her a lift home

50:55.800 --> 50:58.850
because... she'd had a
bit to drink and...

50:59.260 --> 51:01.119
.. she seemed upset.

51:01.120 --> 51:03.120
- About what?
- She didn't say.

51:04.540 --> 51:06.300
Did you see her leave?

51:07.460 --> 51:09.460
She went in that direction, yeah.

51:10.180 --> 51:12.059
Was Mary with you?

51:12.060 --> 51:13.699
No, she went home.

51:13.700 --> 51:16.499
Did anybody see you leave?

51:16.500 --> 51:19.339
Did you speak to anybody else?

51:19.340 --> 51:22.339
I...
I don't think so, no.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.779
For Christ's sake,
Duncan,

51:23.780 --> 51:26.680
why didn't you tell me before
that you'd spoken to Sally?

51:27.620 --> 51:30.419
It was a very brief conversation.

51:30.420 --> 51:33.000
- I forgot.
- You forgot!

51:34.020 --> 51:37.940
You forgot that you'd spoken to a
woman who got killed the same night?

51:40.820 --> 51:42.820
What time did you get home?

51:44.500 --> 51:47.139
- Midnight.
- Right, can Mary confirm that?

51:47.140 --> 51:48.710
No, she was asleep.

51:51.780 --> 51:54.980
You don't seriously think I had
something to do with it, do you?

51:57.060 --> 52:00.350
Cos that would tip my day
over from bad to horrendous.

52:02.660 --> 52:04.590
Come on, have a drink.

52:10.860 --> 52:12.840
I've got to get back to work.

52:18.980 --> 52:21.419
You will see
I was right one day.

52:21.420 --> 52:23.210
That'll never happen.

52:23.980 --> 52:27.579
Maybe I could come back to
Shetland, pay you a visit.

52:27.580 --> 52:30.029
If that is supposed to scare me,
Lars,

52:30.030 --> 52:32.420
you really don't know me.

52:43.260 --> 52:45.820
<i>Locking me up in here
doesn't change anything.</i>

52:46.140 --> 52:48.320
<i>Tosh,
I know you can hear me.</i>

52:49.150 --> 52:50.459
<i>Get them out!</i>

52:50.460 --> 52:53.179
- Good work.
<i>- Get them out!</i>

52:53.180 --> 52:54.990
<i>Get them out!</i>

52:55.450 --> 52:57.499
<i>Get them out!</i>

52:57.500 --> 53:00.310
I heard about Jo Halley.
Is she going to be OK?

53:01.920 --> 53:03.220
Erm, she'll recover.

53:04.540 --> 53:06.139
I don't know about OK.

53:06.140 --> 53:08.909
Do you think it was the same
person that killed Sally?

53:08.910 --> 53:10.760
I don't think so, no.

53:11.740 --> 53:14.230
Truth is, though,
I need to...

53:14.770 --> 53:16.729
I need to know
what happened to Lizzie

53:16.730 --> 53:19.710
in order to try and make
sense of what happened to Sally.

53:20.060 --> 53:22.720
Now,
there's an eight-millimetre film

53:23.730 --> 53:26.750
from back in 1993
at a party on a beach...

53:27.140 --> 53:28.779
.. and you're on it.

53:28.780 --> 53:31.850
And you're watching your
sister and Duncan Hunter,

53:32.540 --> 53:36.360
and I could be wrong,
but you look jealous.

53:37.020 --> 53:38.779
Of my sister?

53:38.780 --> 53:40.080
Yeah.

53:41.380 --> 53:43.189
Absolutely.

53:43.190 --> 53:44.580
I was.

53:47.860 --> 53:49.950
Being a twin is different.

53:50.260 --> 53:52.849
If you lose one,
it's not like losing a sibling.

53:52.850 --> 53:55.080
It's like half of you is just gone.

53:55.940 --> 53:58.080
Just gone.

53:59.220 --> 54:00.970
Anyway,
I would look in the mirror...

54:02.220 --> 54:05.500
.. and all I could see was Lizzie.

54:06.420 --> 54:07.930
I mean, my mum...

54:08.740 --> 54:10.599
My mum couldn't
even look at me

54:10.600 --> 54:13.699
cos all that she saw was a constant
reminder of what she had lost.

54:13.700 --> 54:16.070
So I tried to...

54:16.420 --> 54:18.009
change the way that I looked.

54:18.010 --> 54:20.059
Cut my hair, stopped eating.

54:20.060 --> 54:22.179
And then I started sleeping around,

54:22.180 --> 54:26.099
eand it didn't matter who with, just...

54:26.100 --> 54:28.619
.. just needed somebody
to distract me.

54:28.620 --> 54:30.330
And then I got pregnant.

54:31.700 --> 54:34.890
And Molly changed everything.

54:35.820 --> 54:38.739
I looked in the mirror and
it wasn't Lizzie that I saw,

54:38.740 --> 54:40.110
it was Molly's mum.

54:40.900 --> 54:42.750
I wasn't alone any more.

54:44.500 --> 54:45.800
Sure...

54:46.410 --> 54:49.850
yeah, my feelings towards
Lizzie are quite complicated.

54:50.660 --> 54:51.960
OK.

54:55.420 --> 54:57.690
What about her and Duncan Hunter?

54:58.100 --> 54:59.810
On that day?

55:01.220 --> 55:03.290
She was a pain in the arse.

55:03.900 --> 55:06.500
She was flirting with all the older guys.

55:07.380 --> 55:09.150
But Duncan mostly.

55:53.140 --> 55:54.919
So, I'm sorry.

55:54.920 --> 55:56.750
About earlier.

56:00.220 --> 56:03.380
It's OK.
It's a weird time for you.

56:09.260 --> 56:14.110
So, I kind of threw out all
Mum's old boots and stuff.

56:15.420 --> 56:16.939
I know.

56:16.940 --> 56:19.260
And you're OK with that?

56:21.060 --> 56:22.360
Yeah.

56:24.620 --> 56:27.960
And you're looking at old photographs?

56:34.140 --> 56:35.440
Don't.

56:36.100 --> 56:37.419
OK?

56:37.420 --> 56:41.040
Go and watch the football
or something.

57:55.990 --> 57:58.970
