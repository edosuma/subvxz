[distant chatter]

00:11.875 --> 00:13.000
One, two, three.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.916
[Paul Holmes] Let's go! On the move!

00:16.708 --> 00:17.791
[Jesse Ornelas] Wake up!

00:18.958 --> 00:19.958
Wake up!

00:20.750 --> 00:22.708
-[whistle blowing]
-[players chattering]

00:26.791 --> 00:29.625
[Jason Brown] I gotta get you where
you couldn't take yourself.

00:29.708 --> 00:30.875
That's why you're here.

00:31.208 --> 00:34.958
After a fucking ass rippin',
let's see how much character you have.

00:35.375 --> 00:37.625
You either shit or get off the pot.

00:37.708 --> 00:39.458
It's a mental test. Let's go.

00:39.541 --> 00:43.000
Finish! Finish!
He wanna see who's all quick.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.375
Let's go!

00:44.458 --> 00:46.458
-Finish!
-[Brown] That linebacker's in great shape.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.791
He can't even finish the drill.

00:49.416 --> 00:52.166
He been just eating burgers all summer.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.333
Let's cut him.

00:53.416 --> 00:55.916
[Keith Donerson] Keep going, jog.
It's not a walk. Jog!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.250
What you doing? Let's go.

00:57.333 --> 00:58.958
Are you power walking, son?

00:59.041 --> 01:01.333
[Donerson] Your fat butt out of shape.
Let's go!

01:01.416 --> 01:05.500
[Brown] Fuck me, man! Let's cut some
of these fat fucks! Ridiculous.

01:05.583 --> 01:08.333
Hurry up, Vega!
Get your fat ass fucking going.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.208
-[Donerson] Run!
-Send his ass home!

01:10.291 --> 01:13.458
[Donerson] Run! Everybody else running!
Just stopped. Just quit.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.250
-Wasting my time.
-[Brown] He wasted all of our time.

01:19.625 --> 01:21.291
<i>Look, we're outta shape.</i>

01:21.375 --> 01:23.166
<i>We got outplayed as players.</i>

01:23.708 --> 01:25.416
<i>Coaches, we got out-coached.</i>

01:25.500 --> 01:27.666
<i>We got outclassed as a program.</i>

01:27.750 --> 01:31.708
<i>How about you shut up, humble your pie</i>
<i>and get ready to start over?</i>

01:32.375 --> 01:34.750
<i>I'll find 11 dudes that wanna play here.</i>

01:34.833 --> 01:36.458
<i>It's gonna be cutthroat.</i>

01:36.541 --> 01:39.000
<i>I'll test your will all week.</i>

01:39.541 --> 01:41.125
<i>We got a lot to fix.</i>

01:41.791 --> 01:43.750
[marching band playing]

02:16.166 --> 02:17.541
[indistinct chatter]

02:18.541 --> 02:20.125
[bell rings]

02:20.208 --> 02:24.166
[all] <i>I pledge allegiance to the flag</i>
<i>of the United States of America</i>

02:24.291 --> 02:26.750
<i>and to the Republic for which it stands,</i>

02:26.833 --> 02:32.416
<i>one nation, under God, indivisible,</i>
<i>with liberty and justice for all.</i>

02:32.916 --> 02:36.958
<i>I appreciate you having me.</i>
<i>It's always a pleasure to come speak.</i>

02:37.041 --> 02:43.041
Uh... I come with great humility today
after our performance last week.

02:43.125 --> 02:49.583
I'm embarrassed,
because it was so out of our character.

02:49.666 --> 02:52.291
The whole thing unfolded from the get-go.

02:52.833 --> 02:56.416
But, you know, Rome wasn't built in a day.
We're still building.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.625
Sometimes, we got great players,
five-star guys

02:59.708 --> 03:03.875
with all these high accolades
and stars after their names and all that,

03:04.291 --> 03:08.791
but stars get coaches fired if they don't
do what they're asked or perform.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.458
Independence has supported us greatly.

03:11.541 --> 03:16.208
I love how you guys have accepted us
and how you are showing up at the game.

03:16.291 --> 03:19.333
So, I want the community to know

03:19.416 --> 03:21.666
to keep supporting,
and we'll get this thing going.

03:21.750 --> 03:24.041
We'll figure out how we get that done.

03:24.125 --> 03:26.875
And, uh... we'll see.

03:27.583 --> 03:29.291
[Barwick]
<i>It's a little bit of déjà vu.</i>

03:30.125 --> 03:33.458
It basically reminds me
of two, three years ago

03:33.541 --> 03:37.000
when, actually, that was the way
many of our games were.

03:37.291 --> 03:39.333
We may not have the right pieces
to the puzzle.

03:39.416 --> 03:40.250
We see all...

03:40.333 --> 03:43.250
[Barwick] <i>It's one thing if, say,</i>
<i>the offense is bad.</i>

03:43.333 --> 03:45.750
<i>That's what you gotta work on</i>
<i>for the next week,</i>

03:45.833 --> 03:48.625
<i>but it's tougher when the offense,</i>
<i>the defense,</i>

03:48.708 --> 03:50.250
<i>and the special teams are all bad.</i>

03:50.333 --> 03:53.208
Hopefully, that won't happen again.
We flip it.

03:53.291 --> 03:57.875
[Barwick] <i>The resources the taxpayers pay,</i>
<i>the tuition and fees the students pay,</i>

03:57.958 --> 04:00.958
<i>there's a lot of investment</i>
<i>from a lot of people,</i>

04:01.041 --> 04:04.333
and they don't want mediocrity.

04:05.958 --> 04:08.166
[officer] <i>This is America.</i>
<i>We are competitors</i>

04:08.291 --> 04:09.583
<i>and that's the end of that.</i>

04:09.666 --> 04:13.041
Our economy and culture
are built on competition.

04:13.125 --> 04:15.416
This community is no exception.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.541
<i>[man] That's not an ideal</i>
<i>opening-day game.</i>

04:18.625 --> 04:20.916
They were two scores down
about four minutes in.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.166
It was shoulder-to-shoulder,
which never happens here.

04:23.541 --> 04:27.000
<i>One big loss will abate</i>
<i>people's excitement for the team.</i>

04:27.083 --> 04:28.416
I left at halftime.

04:28.958 --> 04:30.333
That's how I felt.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.416
We were expecting
a little bit better than we got.

04:33.500 --> 04:37.166
A lot of guys came here
because of the coach's reputation.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.458
He's got some talent on that team.

04:39.541 --> 04:40.916
[officer] <i>Talent is not enough.</i>

04:41.000 --> 04:44.291
Dealing with young men,
you're pushing them for all they can give.

04:44.375 --> 04:48.666
You don't tolerate it when they
don't provide what you know they've got.

04:49.333 --> 04:52.458
[Sebastian Cole] <i>I'm pretty damn</i>
<i>used to them losing that bad.</i>

04:52.791 --> 04:58.125
I feel like that's our first major loss
of the year and we're gonna have more.

04:59.416 --> 05:01.000
That's just my opinion.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.208
[LaTonya Pinkard]
<i>It was awful. It was awful.</i>

05:03.291 --> 05:06.791
Hopefully they'll learn how to play
together, mesh well and be okay.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.166
-[shatters]
-Ooh.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.500
Life happens, and you keep on moving.

05:21.333 --> 05:24.000
[Kingston Davis] That was ridiculous.
I've never lost that bad.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.291
70-21--

05:26.375 --> 05:28.125
[player]
Always a first time for everything.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.416
-We needed that, really, to--
-Yeah.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.916
That brought people down,
out their ways.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.166
[Kingston scoffs]

05:36.250 --> 05:40.250
Yeah. People think they so good.
We got shut down like that.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.750
That bring you back to reality.

05:43.166 --> 05:46.041
We also focus on
getting ourselves out of here.

05:46.125 --> 05:50.250
If we weren't so selfish and was together,
the score would have been the other way.

05:51.708 --> 05:52.958
[Brown] <i>What's up, fellas?</i>

05:54.041 --> 05:56.166
<i>Beat Fort Scott, only thing</i>
<i>that should be on our minds.</i>

05:56.791 --> 05:58.375
Humble pie, all right?

05:58.458 --> 06:02.750
If you guys let the last game define you,
we're gonna have a long year.

06:03.708 --> 06:06.541
Everybody has to be bought in,
or it's not gonna work.

06:06.625 --> 06:09.291
Even if I called the wrong play,
if you believed,

06:09.375 --> 06:11.791
you'd go through the wall
and get the play done,

06:11.875 --> 06:13.625
come back and say,
"This was the right call."

06:13.708 --> 06:15.041
Even if it was a bad call.

06:15.833 --> 06:19.583
That's when all the dudes are
invested and bought in. We're not yet.

06:19.958 --> 06:23.875
Can't have dudes doing their own thing
and going against the grain.

06:23.958 --> 06:28.083
If we're not all going in the same
direction, right or wrong, we're fucked.

06:28.791 --> 06:31.000
Tomorrow morning will be a gut check.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.583
5:15 at the stadium.

06:38.833 --> 06:42.250
[Harris] Hey, we're getting started
in one minute. Wake up! Wake up!

06:42.333 --> 06:43.875
-Set! Come on.
-[whistle blows]

06:43.958 --> 06:46.875
Worst performance
of my damn freakin' life, man.

06:46.958 --> 06:48.541
Told the coaches, man.

06:48.625 --> 06:52.041
Recruit these cats who come here to win,
but they ain't getting it done.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.250
Kedar, you ain't finishing.

06:54.333 --> 06:57.250
What happen when we keep a stagger?
Can we do that?

06:57.333 --> 06:58.666
Everybody wanna play!

07:01.916 --> 07:05.250
Everybody wanna play!
But we can't keep a stagger.

07:05.791 --> 07:07.666
Tired of kissing guys' butts
who try to play.

07:07.750 --> 07:11.583
It didn't work the first time,
so why'd I kiss it right now?

07:12.208 --> 07:14.750
'Cause I wanna please Coach Brown?
Hell, no.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.083
[Diaz] <i>Someone's gotta step up.</i>

07:17.750 --> 07:20.958
This is one of you guys' chance
to get a job because it's open.

07:22.291 --> 07:25.625
Be a coachable quarterback
who does what I ask him.

07:25.708 --> 07:26.541
[Bea] Set.

07:27.375 --> 07:30.375
[Diaz] We gotta wake up.
Start getting into it. Let's go.

07:30.833 --> 07:31.958
[player] <i>What's wrong?</i>

07:32.041 --> 07:34.666
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>Just going through concussion protocol.</i>

07:34.750 --> 07:37.541
-You got a concussion?
-No, but, um...

07:37.875 --> 07:40.000
Ms. Raechal wants me to sit out.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.458
<i>I don't know if it's post corner...</i>

07:41.541 --> 07:44.041
It's post corner, Coach.
It's only three steps.

07:44.416 --> 07:45.666
And then come back outside--

07:45.750 --> 07:47.333
-I don't like that, though.
-Huh?

07:48.375 --> 07:50.833
Wake up. Let's go.
Get out there. Come on.

07:51.208 --> 07:52.875
[Malik] Don't break down at the top.

07:52.958 --> 07:54.750
Gotta sneak that out of there.

07:54.833 --> 07:56.791
-[Diaz] Let's go. Next two.
-[Bea] Set.

07:57.375 --> 07:58.333
[Diaz] Throw it.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.833
[Malik] Hey, give us more room.
Just a little more.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.291
Three steps hard inside.

08:03.625 --> 08:06.125
[player] Tell him to coach
the quarterbacks, Coach. Can you?

08:06.208 --> 08:07.041
[Diaz] Say what?

08:07.125 --> 08:09.125
[player]
Y'all coach the quarterbacks, Coach.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.625
[smacks lips] All right. All right.

08:12.708 --> 08:15.500
[Diaz] Hey, give me circus.
Give me circus. Circus.

08:15.583 --> 08:17.000
Quick feet, quick feet.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.250
Neither quarterback
has completed that circus route.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.833
-[Bea] I did.
-[Diaz] It went straight to the ground.

08:24.916 --> 08:27.291
Quarterbacks gotta be coachable.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.875
[Malik] <i>On the offensive side of the ball,</i>
<i>as far as quarterbacks and receivers go,</i>

08:31.958 --> 08:34.208
we're not on the same page.
We don't communicate.

08:34.791 --> 08:37.166
I don't need to be calling the shots,

08:37.250 --> 08:41.750
but I feel like I should be able
to at least help us out a little bit.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.208
[Kerry] You know what you're doing.

08:43.291 --> 08:45.750
[Malik] I can't communicate to them,
because if I do,

08:45.833 --> 08:49.083
it seems like I'm being an asshole
when I'm really not.

08:49.166 --> 08:50.000
Yeah.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.750
I'm trying to get us better.

08:51.833 --> 08:55.708
I was at Florida State.
I've seen what a winning team looks like,

08:55.791 --> 08:59.083
how they're supposed to practice,
and it's not like this.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.458
[Kerry] Not even close.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
[Jason Martin] Focus!

09:03.541 --> 09:05.583
[Malik] That makes me not wanna even play.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.333
[Carlos] That's because
you put DBs back...

09:07.416 --> 09:09.000
-[Martin] Here we go.
-He dropped that.

09:09.083 --> 09:09.916
[Martin] Here we go.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.625
[Raechal] Let's talk about
the dropped balls from wide receivers.

09:12.708 --> 09:14.291
-[Carlos] How many?
-[Martin] Be quiet,

09:14.375 --> 09:16.583
take one back in the game
and then talk to me.

09:16.666 --> 09:17.500
-Right.
-Chill.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.125
Tell him to block for me.

09:19.208 --> 09:22.750
This is what I realized, Coach.
This is my conclusion. They block for everybody else,
'cause they watch me trying to make moves.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.833
That's why they not blocking.
They watching me make moves.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.291
[Brown] Jesse. Jesse.

09:31.208 --> 09:32.833
Where's, uh, Kingston?

09:32.916 --> 09:34.375
[indistinct chatter]

09:37.458 --> 09:38.458
[Kingston] God, please.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.000
[clicks tongue]

09:40.583 --> 09:42.458
Why you ain't answer my call?

09:44.291 --> 09:45.375
I called you, too.

09:46.291 --> 09:49.166
[Harris] I'm a real coach.
I don't bring my phone on the field.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.041
My car broke down all the way over there.

09:51.125 --> 09:51.958
We had to walk.

09:52.833 --> 09:53.875
Good exercise.

09:54.583 --> 09:55.666
[player] <i>What happened?</i>

09:56.166 --> 09:58.583
<i>I'm driving on the road,</i>
<i>it starts slowing down,</i>

09:59.750 --> 10:03.458
my computer start flashing
and glitching and stuff like that.

10:03.541 --> 10:05.583
When I pulled over, it shut down.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.750
[Brown] That's a sign you shouldn't have
had the car here.

10:08.833 --> 10:12.750
<i>When you bring a ton of talent in,</i>
<i>they think they're better than they are.</i>

10:12.833 --> 10:14.750
<i>The cancer may saturate throughout.</i>

10:14.833 --> 10:19.208
<i>Rakeem Boyd, Kingston Davis,</i>
<i>big-time high school stars.</i>

10:19.291 --> 10:21.875
Went to Michigan,
one went to Texas A&amp;M.

10:21.958 --> 10:25.916
<i>I don't know if talent</i>
<i>can equal one's character or heart.</i>

10:26.000 --> 10:28.541
<i>Rakeem hasn't practiced all week.</i>
<i>Inexcusable.</i>

10:29.083 --> 10:32.625
A lot of these Division I guys,
sorry to say, they're broken.

10:32.708 --> 10:35.291
-What do you think it is right now?
-[Raechal] An ankle sprain.

10:35.375 --> 10:38.833
I would like for you to hold it there,
so I can tape this ankle.

10:38.916 --> 10:41.375
[Boyd] What do you think the percent is?

10:41.458 --> 10:44.541
How sprained it is?
It's a Grade 1, where you have...

10:44.625 --> 10:47.458
You've had recurring ankle sprains
here before,

10:47.541 --> 10:50.958
but you have good strength in it.
You need more control.

10:51.541 --> 10:52.625
[Boyd] This shit tiring.

10:52.708 --> 10:54.750
[Raechal] I know.
That's why you're doing it.

10:54.833 --> 10:56.916
-[Boyd] Will I play a lot?
-[Raechal] I hope so.

10:57.375 --> 10:59.500
Keep the ball in your hand,
you'll play a lot.

10:59.916 --> 11:01.333
[chuckles]

11:01.416 --> 11:02.416
You would.

11:03.333 --> 11:05.666
[Carlos] Oh, no,
this thing's 48 degrees.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.916
-[groaning]
-[Raechal] You are so dramatic.

11:09.791 --> 11:12.000
Man, us skinny people
are not made to be in this.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.791
[Raechal] The girl that was in here
before you just hopped in and sat.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.708
It's all good. It's all good.

11:16.791 --> 11:18.416
-[Raechal] Is it?
-It's all good.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.125
More power to her.
More power to her.

11:21.541 --> 11:23.708
[Calvin Jackson]
My joint is swollen all over.

11:23.791 --> 11:25.291
My good leg, my joint was like this.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.083
My bad leg, it was like this.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.875
[Brown]
<i>What's Calvin Jackson's real deal?</i>

11:29.250 --> 11:31.583
[Raechal]
He has a significant hamstring strain.

11:31.666 --> 11:32.750
He don't wanna practice.

11:32.833 --> 11:35.291
[Brown] You never know with him.
You don't know if he's soft.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.583
You think you can not practice
and play at Washington?

11:37.666 --> 11:39.250
I'm not doing it on purpose.
I'm hurt.

11:39.333 --> 11:41.625
-I wanna make sure you fight through it.
-Yeah.

11:41.708 --> 11:43.875
I'm gonna start cutting dudes.
You know the deal.

11:43.958 --> 11:46.208
My gut is telling me
we've got the wrong nucleus.

11:46.291 --> 11:49.708
[Holmes] <i>If you don't go hard in practice,</i>
<i>how do I expect you to go hard Saturday?</i>

11:49.791 --> 11:53.708
Our guys feel like they have a switch
they can turn on any time.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.750
I would try teaching them

11:56.041 --> 11:59.000
<i>there ain't no such thing as a switch.</i>
<i>You gotta bring it every day.</i>

11:59.291 --> 12:01.833
Bad news. I can't practice or play.

12:01.916 --> 12:02.833
[Raechal] What?

12:04.708 --> 12:06.250
How did this come about?

12:06.791 --> 12:09.166
I got the flu, so no practice.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.958
When was the last time you had a fever?

12:11.500 --> 12:14.500
-[Emmit] Yesterday.
-[Raechal] Let's see if you have a fever.

12:16.666 --> 12:18.041
[beeps]

12:18.166 --> 12:20.291
[Raechal] No. 97.5.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.083
[Brown] <i>This shit, it's crazy, man.</i>

12:22.166 --> 12:25.333
<i>How many big-time D-I transfer freaks</i>
<i>are playing?</i>

12:25.458 --> 12:27.625
-I don't know.
-[Brown] We got 27 of them.

12:28.833 --> 12:30.625
Not one of them are playing.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.583
They don't make it. They're broken.
They're fucked.

12:33.666 --> 12:38.708
Malik Henry, who's a fucking borderline,
being kicked out any minute, who else?

12:38.791 --> 12:39.750
[Ornelas] Carlos.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.291
Carlos Thompson,
who ain't played in four years.

12:42.375 --> 12:46.291
He's 22 years old. He's a derelict,
ready to go home. Who else?

12:46.375 --> 12:48.583
-[Ornelas] Kingston Davis.
-[Brown] He's a fuckstick.

12:48.666 --> 12:49.791
He can't do right.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.250
He's missed how many times?
He's late how many times?

12:52.333 --> 12:55.541
He is an epitome of a fuckstick.

12:55.625 --> 12:56.708
So, fuck 'em.

12:56.791 --> 12:57.625
Who else?

12:57.708 --> 13:01.416
-[Ornelas] Rakeem.
-Rakeem Boyd's a fucking holy fuckstick.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.666
-[chuckles]
-[Brown] Boyd's broken, bro.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.166
I don't know.
You've got a bunch of broken dudes.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.916
We don't have a D-I transfer worth shit.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.833
We don't have time to fucking fix 'em.

13:09.916 --> 13:12.500
[Harris] None of 'em really played
on the field, for a reason.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.416
[Brown] Yeah.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.791
No transfers are panning out.
So, who else?

13:16.208 --> 13:18.416
How many guys do we have
that we can live with?

13:19.083 --> 13:20.708
-[indistinct chatter]
-[whistle blows]

13:21.958 --> 13:23.958
[Manoa Latu]
Bobby, remember this dude can run.

13:24.041 --> 13:28.625
So you gonna take off, he gonna do this,
and then run right up the middle.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.666
[Bobby Bruce] <i>First game,</i>
<i>we got blown out. I barely even played.</i>

13:31.750 --> 13:34.958
I don't just wanna be on the sideline.
I wanna be in there.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.958
-[Brown] Bobby playing?
-Let's give him some reps.

13:37.041 --> 13:38.583
A bit more reps this week, but...

13:38.666 --> 13:41.416
At least I know he'll go down there
with reckless abandonment.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.083
How many guys like that you got?

13:43.166 --> 13:44.791
<i>When I let him hold the line, cut him?</i>

13:44.875 --> 13:47.083
Yeah. That's why I want you
to meet him there and cut him.

13:47.166 --> 13:48.166
[Jamal] All right, man.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.083
-[Diaz] Very good.
-[player 1] Let's do it.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.000
-[player 2] Come on.
-[Diaz] Good.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.375
<i>Jamal Scott is better than them.</i>

13:54.458 --> 13:58.250
<i>He's just a dude.</i>
<i>He's hard to tackle, deceiving speed.</i>

13:58.333 --> 14:00.333
He's just a big body with ballerina feet.

14:00.416 --> 14:02.750
We'll start to see your ass.
We'll let you out the cage.

14:02.833 --> 14:04.541
I gotta get out! [chuckles]

14:04.625 --> 14:08.250
[Jamal] <i>Kingston and Rakeem,</i>
<i>if he thought they was better than me,</i>

14:08.333 --> 14:09.666
<i>I shouldn't be playing football.</i>

14:09.750 --> 14:13.625
If I can't compete with them,
I can't compete at the next level.

14:13.708 --> 14:14.708
You feeling good?

14:15.541 --> 14:16.875
[Rakeem] <i>I gotta bounce back,</i>

14:16.958 --> 14:20.291
<i>'cause they weren't just gonna</i>
<i>hand it to me, so I gotta come stronger.</i>

14:20.375 --> 14:23.041
That's what everyone was waiting for,
me to pop off.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.625
I don't think they've seen me
at my full potential yet.

14:25.708 --> 14:29.125
<i>Not one dude that played on Saturday</i>
<i>in the front, but that's okay.</i>

14:29.208 --> 14:32.250
<i>Guess what? Coach expose you</i>
<i>in the goddamn film room today,</i>

14:32.333 --> 14:33.208
<i>and make changes.</i>

14:33.291 --> 14:35.416
<i>Time to give other guys shots, man.</i>

14:36.708 --> 14:37.625
[coach] Rakeem.

14:42.666 --> 14:44.791
[Harris] <i>How long till the food's ready?</i>
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

14:44.875 --> 14:45.708
[Brown] <i>Done.</i>

14:45.791 --> 14:49.250
[Harris] I'll call up Martha Stewart.
She can't fuck with me.

14:49.333 --> 14:50.375
[Brown] Bam.

14:51.083 --> 14:54.750
That's what I'm talking about. That's
enough for me and you plus the O-line.

14:54.833 --> 14:57.083
[Brown] That's your salad right there.
You need salad.

14:57.166 --> 15:01.208
[chuckles] This is the first time
I ever ate raspberry dressing.

15:01.750 --> 15:02.583
Is it?

15:02.666 --> 15:05.333
Julia tried to give me this stuff.
I said, "Just give me the ranch."

15:05.416 --> 15:07.083
I need a female, man.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.458
[Harris] I don't remember him having one.

15:09.541 --> 15:11.916
-Me being the spiritual adviser...
-[Brown scoffs]

15:12.000 --> 15:15.083
...I'm working on this, and I think
we're to the recognition part,

15:15.166 --> 15:17.291
so he's starting to realize a few things.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.541
So, realistically, I'm doing a better job
than the guy who had Buddy Stephens.

15:21.625 --> 15:24.333
Realizing there might need to be a change.

15:24.416 --> 15:25.708
[both laughing]

15:25.791 --> 15:27.875
[Brown] You make me drink, man. Shoot.

15:27.958 --> 15:30.375
-I don't make you drink.
-You talk about females too much.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.541
You need to drink again.
You might be a nicer guy.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.625
[Harris] Me and JB are roommates.

15:34.708 --> 15:37.291
I pay rent by cleaning up
around the place. [chuckles]

15:37.375 --> 15:41.000
That was the agreement to get me
coming out here to coach.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.875
I didn't wanna stay in the dorms.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.708
<i>Plus, it gives him somebody</i>
<i>to talk to sometimes.</i>

15:45.791 --> 15:47.458
<i>We need to talk to somebody.</i>

15:47.541 --> 15:50.125
We thought we were
really loaded. Talented.

15:50.208 --> 15:51.125
We are talented.

15:51.208 --> 15:54.083
[Brown] Yeah. We haven't had
that one guy emerge yet.

15:54.958 --> 15:56.083
Malik Henry?

15:56.166 --> 15:58.458
Told him to shut up.
He tried to be a smart ass.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.291
Season's on the line, too.
He knows I'll cut him.

16:01.375 --> 16:02.708
He knows in his heart.

16:02.791 --> 16:05.416
If we could get a quarterback
that tried a little bit... Man. -[Brown] Yeah. What about Carlos?
-[Harris] Texas Tech?

16:08.208 --> 16:09.416
-[Brown] Yeah.
-[Harris] Raised?

16:09.500 --> 16:12.916
[Brown] He got kicked outta there
for smoking.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.375
<i>Brought him to Garden City.</i>

16:14.458 --> 16:17.833
When I left Garden City,
I took him with me to California,

16:18.375 --> 16:21.500
and then when I got this job,
I brought him back here.

16:21.583 --> 16:24.041
And so, been with him three years now.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.291
He's a talented cat. Explosive.

16:26.375 --> 16:29.458
Gotta get him to take it serious
and make this his profession,

16:29.875 --> 16:31.916
because it can't be a hobby for him.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.208
[Carlos] You know what I want.

16:33.291 --> 16:36.083
[woman] You want fried chicken?
What do you want?

16:36.166 --> 16:38.583
Oh, I'll just take two thighs.
I'll be good.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.666
[woman] OK. Call you up in a second.

16:42.750 --> 16:43.875
Thank you.

16:44.291 --> 16:45.250
Thank you.

16:46.750 --> 16:47.625
Man.

16:47.708 --> 16:48.916
Got your chicken fried again?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.750
Come on, man.
That's the only way I eat it.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.416
She just do it for me.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.916
I asked her one time,
and she's done it since. Nobody else decides to ask,
but I'm gonna do it.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.875
[player] I'm about to start
having them do that.

17:00.958 --> 17:02.833
[Carlos] I'm telling you,
it's the way to go.

17:02.916 --> 17:04.416
But that chicken don't be cooked.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.333
They make it seem
like I get special privileges.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.416
I don't get no special privileges.
[chuckles]

17:11.333 --> 17:12.750
[cell phone vibrating]

17:13.750 --> 17:14.833
[player] Is that Coach?

17:14.916 --> 17:18.333
[Carlos] Yeah, it's Brown.
Wait till I show you the text I just got.

17:18.416 --> 17:20.541
-Another one?
-Another one. Yes.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.416
-About this morning?
-Yes.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.125
[player] He sent you the paragraph?

17:26.208 --> 17:28.208
[Carlos laughs] I know.

17:28.291 --> 17:31.000
He told me I've been
running the wrong routes

17:31.083 --> 17:33.125
and I've been doing
too much freelance stuff.

17:33.208 --> 17:35.750
He said if I don't get my act together,

17:35.833 --> 17:37.750
I'mma have to do some punishment.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.000
I gotta chill, man.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.791
[woman] <i>Don't react.</i>
<i>Just say, "Yes, sir," and that's it.</i>

17:43.208 --> 17:46.166
[Carlos] I don't know.
They keep putting me in... They keep putting me in some bad spots.
That's all I'm saying.

17:49.666 --> 17:51.333
Send a text and say, "Okay."

17:52.833 --> 17:53.958
All right.

17:54.041 --> 17:56.625
You'll make the problem worse
by being rude.

17:58.875 --> 18:02.083
[Carlos] <i>The thing that I struggle with</i>
<i>is keeping my mouth shut at times.</i>

18:02.166 --> 18:05.250
I tend to have to get the last word

18:05.333 --> 18:09.083
in the conversation
or possibly an argument, if anything.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.416
And that tends to get me in trouble a lot.

18:11.708 --> 18:13.500
At times, I feel like...

18:14.166 --> 18:17.833
I can make the bad decisions
and still kinda squeak by.

18:17.916 --> 18:20.291
But now, as I get farther
into the adult world,

18:20.375 --> 18:23.333
I see you gotta make
good decisions at all times

18:23.416 --> 18:25.166
if you want good things to happen. [Tatasha Scott-Hicks]
<i>Carlos is my only son,</i>

18:33.541 --> 18:35.291
<i>and he's been into sports</i>
<i>since he was four.</i>

18:35.375 --> 18:37.583
<i>He started out playing</i>
<i>Little League football.</i>

18:37.666 --> 18:40.583
He's been playing football
since he was five.

18:40.958 --> 18:45.541
I used to do about 150 miles in one day.
Work, coming back, going way out there.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.791
It's about 150 miles one way.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.625
[Carlos]<i> My mom honestly</i>
<i>never missed a game.</i>

18:50.708 --> 18:55.375
She's always been my backbone throughout
this whole thing, no matter what.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.583
[Scott-Hicks]
<i>At Texas Tech, he fell by the wayside.</i>

18:58.666 --> 19:03.291
<i>He has an authority thing, and I tell him</i>
<i>sometimes, "Wait before you speak."</i>

19:03.375 --> 19:05.583
Because you have to think it through.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.625
Sometimes, when you're upset,

19:07.708 --> 19:10.000
you feel things are not going your way,

19:10.083 --> 19:11.916
you may say the wrong things.

19:12.458 --> 19:15.375
But he kinda got that from me.
[laughs]

19:16.000 --> 19:18.125
<i>So, he stayed outta school a whole year.</i>

19:18.208 --> 19:20.500
[Carlos] <i>Honestly, it was a moment</i>
<i>when I was here working.</i>

19:20.583 --> 19:21.666
<i>I was valeting cars.</i>

19:21.750 --> 19:23.375
<i>And I'm sitting here thinking, I'm like,</i>

19:23.458 --> 19:27.166
"I'm sitting here valeting somebody's car
that I wanna own.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.291
Is this what you wanna do
your whole life?

19:29.375 --> 19:32.250
Work for somebody else?
Drive somebody else's nice car?"

19:32.666 --> 19:35.458
<i>So, I guess that moment</i>
<i>of when reality hits, like,</i>

19:35.541 --> 19:37.833
<i>"Man, you might have to do this</i>
<i>the rest of your life</i>

19:37.916 --> 19:40.416
<i>if you don't get it together.</i>
<i>So let's go."</i>

19:41.041 --> 19:42.958
[Regina Scott]
<i>He was always an "I can do it" kid.</i>

19:43.041 --> 19:45.416
Anything he wanna do,
"I can do it. I can do it."

19:45.500 --> 19:47.791
He never said no to himself, so...

19:49.250 --> 19:51.666
Right now, he's my comeback kid.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.333
-That's what I call him.
-[Carlos] Yeah.

19:53.416 --> 19:55.791
[Scott-Hicks] <i>As parents,</i>
<i>you want the best for your kids,</i>

19:55.875 --> 19:58.875
and you're sitting there saying,
"Are you gonna get on the right track?

19:58.958 --> 20:00.625
Will you do things?
Are you gonna change?

20:00.708 --> 20:01.583
Will you do this?"

20:01.833 --> 20:04.458
<i>But as a mother, that's my only child.</i>

20:04.541 --> 20:06.333
<i>His good and the bad, I'm there.</i>

20:06.416 --> 20:09.458
[Carlos] <i>There's been people here</i>
<i>or there that have been like,</i>

20:09.541 --> 20:11.166
<i>"Oh, maybe 'Los won't get it together,"</i>

20:11.250 --> 20:16.000
but it never even crossed my mom's mind.
She always knew I would get it right.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.583
[Scott-Hicks] <i>For him to get into ICC,</i>
<i>I spent lots of money</i>

20:18.666 --> 20:20.166
<i>to physically get his transcripts.</i>

20:20.250 --> 20:23.041
Remember, he wasn't at one university,
he was at several.

20:23.125 --> 20:25.666
His mom paid $14,000 for him to get here

20:25.750 --> 20:28.583
because he owed six schools
transcript fees.

20:28.666 --> 20:30.916
<i>She took a loan out</i>
<i>to pay for this kid.</i>

20:31.000 --> 20:32.250
[Carlos] <i>Every call she made,</i>

20:32.333 --> 20:35.291
<i>she let me hear the amounts</i>
<i>that she was just paying off.</i>

20:35.375 --> 20:38.291
Letting me see, like,
"I have faith in you, son,

20:38.375 --> 20:41.500
but don't mess over me again.
Don't mess over me."

20:42.375 --> 20:43.458
[Brown] <i>I like the kid.</i>

20:43.541 --> 20:46.875
<i>I wanna help the kid, but will he ever</i>
<i>figure it out? I don't know.</i>

20:53.958 --> 20:56.000
-[Pinkard] <i>You're on the right track.</i>
-[student 1] <i>No.</i>

20:56.083 --> 20:57.208
You're on the right track.

20:57.291 --> 20:58.750
[student 2] Oh, my God.

20:58.833 --> 21:00.875
[Pinkard] OK, I will have
to move you all for real.

21:00.958 --> 21:02.041
[students laughing]

21:02.125 --> 21:04.291
-[Pinkard] Emmit.
-[students chattering]

21:05.500 --> 21:07.791
[student 3] Oh, man! [laughing]

21:07.875 --> 21:12.375
[Pinkard] I started to wear
all black yesterday to mourn that score.

21:12.458 --> 21:16.625
But I didn't do that.
So, next game, we got this, right?

21:16.750 --> 21:19.208
So, how we feeling about grammar?
We're good?

21:19.333 --> 21:20.916
[student] I'm good.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.500
You gonna tap out on me again, Bobby?
You not going to tap out, right?

21:24.583 --> 21:25.666
You got me today?

21:26.416 --> 21:28.291
-What is wrong?
-[Carlos] We tired.

21:28.375 --> 21:30.125
We've been up since 4:30 this morning.

21:30.208 --> 21:33.125
[Pinkard] Who all has been up
since 4:30 in this morning?

21:33.208 --> 21:35.375
-I got up, I went back to bed.
-You'll be all right.

21:35.458 --> 21:38.250
4:30 is gonna only make you
a better student, a better person,

21:38.333 --> 21:39.500
more conditioned and so on.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.416
How many athletes are in here?

21:42.958 --> 21:45.500
If you had a bad experience

21:45.583 --> 21:49.458
or you zoned out at some point
when it came to learning grammar...

21:50.750 --> 21:52.250
Let me ask that question.

21:52.333 --> 21:55.916
Who zoned out when it came to grammar
in high school?

21:57.166 --> 21:58.041
Okay.

21:58.125 --> 21:59.416
And that's okay.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.333
I have 15 weeks.

22:01.416 --> 22:03.708
This is only a second in your life.

22:03.791 --> 22:05.750
-We'll fix it and get it right.
-Right.

22:05.833 --> 22:08.458
[Pinkard] <i>You know,</i>
<i>week one through five is hard.</i>

22:08.541 --> 22:11.583
<i>We're building.</i>
<i>So I don't take it so personal.</i>

22:11.666 --> 22:12.916
<i>I'm like, "I see where you are.</i>

22:13.791 --> 22:16.750
I have a feeling of what you've
gone through with your education.

22:16.833 --> 22:17.916
I gotta help you."

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Are you good here?

22:19.083 --> 22:20.125
Nah, I ain't good.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.041
[Pinkard] What are you not good about?

22:22.125 --> 22:23.083
With all this.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.000
Okay.

22:24.083 --> 22:25.416
I need your help.

22:26.416 --> 22:30.000
-[Pinkard] What you need me to do?
-Tell me if I'm right or wrong.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.541
Okay, so pull out your notes.

22:31.625 --> 22:34.250
[smacks lips] Uh, well...

22:34.333 --> 22:36.000
I ain't have no paper that day.

22:37.750 --> 22:38.625
All right.

22:38.708 --> 22:40.750
Okay, so hold on. Here's the thing.

22:40.833 --> 22:44.458
If I keep telling you the answer,
you'll never get it.

22:44.541 --> 22:46.708
But I'll help you through it, okay?

22:46.791 --> 22:48.916
All right. So what you just...

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
<i>If you're discouraged now,</i>
<i>it's only gonna get worse. </i>

22:52.083 --> 22:55.000
<i>So I try to get them to understand </i>

22:55.083 --> 22:57.625
<i>you're better than</i>
<i>what you expect yourself to be.</i>

22:57.708 --> 23:00.791
Whatever you need me to do to help you
get from here to there

23:00.875 --> 23:03.333
because of whatever that happened,
water under the bridge,

23:03.416 --> 23:04.625
let me help you get there.

23:04.708 --> 23:05.833
Number 12.

23:05.916 --> 23:08.833
-[students speaking indistinctly]
-Um, semicolon.

23:08.916 --> 23:10.750
[Pinkard] Semicolon. Okay, good.

23:22.291 --> 23:24.083
[Brown] Coach, we're all fucked up. -[player] Olly! Olly!
-[Brown] Olly what?

23:27.375 --> 23:30.583
Pistol Molly? Pistol Molly?
What is the play?

23:30.666 --> 23:32.041
[Latson] Run, run, run.

23:32.125 --> 23:34.791
[Brown] Well, I wish
they were in sequence, Coach.

23:35.333 --> 23:36.500
What number are we on?

23:37.125 --> 23:40.000
I wish the thing
had the right numbers on it!

23:41.583 --> 23:44.625
There ain't no fucking seven!
Fucking genius!

23:45.000 --> 23:46.916
[Malik] I think
he's talking nonsense today.

23:47.000 --> 23:47.958
[Calvin] What?

23:48.041 --> 23:50.125
[Malik] Like the way
he runs this whole shit.

23:50.666 --> 23:52.708
The way he does things in general.

23:52.791 --> 23:56.041
He's so iffy about everything.

23:56.125 --> 23:58.458
[Diaz] Someone's gotta be a leader.
That's what we need.

23:58.541 --> 23:59.791
Ain't nobody wanna step up.

23:59.875 --> 24:01.583
[Malik]
No, but if I step up and be talking,

24:01.666 --> 24:03.041
y'all get mad at me or some shit.

24:03.125 --> 24:06.208
Coach, Latson said yesterday that
I can't even talk to the receivers.

24:06.291 --> 24:08.333
Stop asking for a leader
if I can't be vocal.

24:08.416 --> 24:11.000
[Diaz] There's a difference between being
a leader and coaching.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.375
-Be coachable--
-But why? Tell me why.

24:13.458 --> 24:17.166
-That's just the way they are. I can't--
-Okay. But why can't I talk to my--

24:17.250 --> 24:20.458
Exactly. Why can't I talk to my guys
and tell them what I need

24:20.541 --> 24:21.708
so we are on the same page?

24:21.791 --> 24:23.875
I understand
where you're coming from, Malik,

24:23.958 --> 24:27.083
but I'm telling you there's certain people
who don't like that.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.833
You got coaches that are sensitive
'cause I know what I'm talking about.

24:30.916 --> 24:33.041
Y'all wanna be mad 'cause I know my stuff.

24:35.458 --> 24:36.416
It ain't my fault.

24:37.208 --> 24:39.750
I've been around
one of the greatest coaches ever.

24:41.958 --> 24:44.291
<i>We thought we were gonna roll in</i>
<i>and beat somebody up </i>

24:44.375 --> 24:46.250
<i>'cause we had bouncebacks on our teams.</i>

24:46.333 --> 24:49.958
But having bouncebacks isn't gonna
just automatically win you every game.

24:50.041 --> 24:52.666
You gotta be organized
and have a game plan.

24:52.750 --> 24:54.708
We didn't really have a set game plan,

24:54.791 --> 24:56.916
<i>and we went in and got our ass beat. </i>

24:57.000 --> 24:59.791
I've never been a part of something
that embarrassing ever.

25:03.791 --> 25:06.375
<i>When I was at Florida State,</i>
<i>there was a lot of pressure.</i>

25:06.458 --> 25:08.958
<i>Um, I went in there with a lot of hype.</i>

25:09.041 --> 25:12.500
<i>Everybody knew me as</i>
<i>Malik Henry, number one quarterback,</i>

25:12.583 --> 25:15.791
<i>so I definitely felt pressure</i>
<i>from parents and grandparents, </i>

25:15.875 --> 25:17.291
<i>close family members, everybody. </i>

25:17.750 --> 25:21.000
<i>The fans, you know, they were already</i>
<i>comparing me to Jameis.</i>

25:21.083 --> 25:24.500
I was 17 and everything,
still trying to figure things out,

25:24.583 --> 25:26.166
<i>you know, just out there alone.</i>

25:26.250 --> 25:28.875
<i>I was going through some things,</i>
<i>depression-wise. </i>

25:28.958 --> 25:34.291
Me not feeling ready played into
the anxiety and the depression, too.

25:34.375 --> 25:37.166
[Brown] <i>I don't know if anyone knows</i>
<i>the real story but Malik Henry.</i>

25:37.250 --> 25:41.083
<i>I believe when he knew</i>
<i>he wasn't gonna be the guy, it went south.</i>

25:41.166 --> 25:43.250
<i>Both mentally and emotionally. </i>

25:43.333 --> 25:45.458
<i>Me being the head coach</i>
<i>and him being the quarterback,</i>

25:45.541 --> 25:50.208
<i>we have to make it seem like every day</i>
<i>is the best day that we've ever had.</i>

25:50.291 --> 25:53.458
Nobody can know that he's down or up.

25:53.541 --> 25:56.208
He needs to be even keel
and stay consistent.

25:56.291 --> 25:57.666
That's his biggest issue.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.041
[Malik] <i>I was in eighth grade</i>

26:01.125 --> 26:04.875
<i>and we would have high school coaches</i>
<i>at our games, </i>

26:04.958 --> 26:09.541
<i>asking us to visit their high school</i>
<i>and basically recruiting us.</i>

26:09.875 --> 26:12.208
<i>As a little kid, I didn't expect that.</i>

26:12.333 --> 26:15.875
<i>They tried to bribe me</i>
<i>and promise me things,</i>

26:15.958 --> 26:19.000
<i>but I've only had</i>
<i>one quarterback coach in my life,</i>

26:19.083 --> 26:20.916
<i>and that's Coach Ward.</i>

26:21.875 --> 26:24.041
[Ward]
<i>His mom and dad brought him to me,</i>

26:24.125 --> 26:25.500
<i>and he wanted to play quarterback.</i>

26:25.583 --> 26:28.916
<i>I happened to have coached Coach Brown</i>
<i>at the JUCO level.</i>

26:29.000 --> 26:33.291
When this opportunity came for Malik
to come here, I was pushing that,

26:33.375 --> 26:37.000
I was pressing it, because I know
that if he gets around my son,

26:37.083 --> 26:40.500
<i>he's going to reinforce</i>
<i>what I've already set forth for him.</i>

26:40.583 --> 26:42.125
One team now, Malik. It's one eye.

26:42.208 --> 26:44.333
[Ward] <i>I am so proud of JB.</i>

26:44.416 --> 26:46.083
Who replaced you
as the youngest head coach?

26:46.166 --> 26:47.791
Ah, my son.

26:47.875 --> 26:49.541
[both laugh]

26:50.583 --> 26:52.166
-[Ward] Yeah, but--
-At the same school.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.500
[Ward] Isn't that something?
That's history right there.

26:54.583 --> 26:58.583
[Brown] <i>I was about 10 or 11,</i>
<i>I was at a YMCA in South Central LA.</i>

26:58.666 --> 27:00.125
<i>Coach Ward brought me over,</i>

27:00.208 --> 27:03.125
<i>and from that point on,</i>
<i>I was like, I'm...</i>

27:03.208 --> 27:07.041
This is my boy here.
He's going to be around.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.250
He's not to be screwed with.

27:08.333 --> 27:12.208
<i>I was kind of known as their son</i>
<i>or whatever you wanna call it,</i>

27:12.291 --> 27:16.625
<i>and I basically would be with them</i>
<i>for years and years later.</i>

27:16.708 --> 27:19.333
[Malik] <i>I respect anybody</i>
<i>Coach Ward trusts.</i>

27:19.416 --> 27:23.791
<i>But Coach Brown's from Compton, and</i>
<i>the way guys play down here in the hood</i>

27:23.875 --> 27:26.041
is different than most people would play.

27:26.125 --> 27:28.208
<i>I grew up playing for Inglewood</i>
<i>and it was the same.</i>

27:28.291 --> 27:32.791
<i>Unorganized, fighting at the game,</i>
<i>so that's what he's used to.</i>

27:32.875 --> 27:35.916
But he'll give you his shirt off his back.
I believe that.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.416
That's what I really respect him for.

27:42.750 --> 27:46.750
So I'm gonna read the second paragraph.
I'm on page 11.

27:46.833 --> 27:49.375
"At MAPP, I was the only
African-American in most of my classes.

27:49.458 --> 27:51.500
When I walked into one room and sat down,

27:51.583 --> 27:53.791
the students near me would get up
and move away

27:53.875 --> 27:56.458
as if my dark skin were dirty
and hideous to them.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.041
'You know I hate niggers,' they'd say,

27:58.125 --> 28:00.416
'I don't understand why they follow
white people everywhere.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.500
Why don't they stay
in their own schools?'

28:02.583 --> 28:03.958
I tried to become invisible.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.791
I kept to myself,
remained quiet during class discussions

28:06.875 --> 28:10.000
and never asked questions in
or after class. I spent hours..."

28:10.083 --> 28:12.000
<i>I question all of my students.</i>

28:12.458 --> 28:14.208
<i>"When did you last read a book?"</i>

28:14.291 --> 28:18.041
And they would tell me,
"Probably the third grade.

28:18.250 --> 28:20.125
Possibly, sixth or seventh grade."

28:20.208 --> 28:23.166
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>"Let me try to get a book club going</i>

28:23.250 --> 28:24.458
<i>with some young black men."</i>

28:24.541 --> 28:28.000
<i>I tell them all time, I said,</i>
<i>"A black man with a book is sexy."</i>

28:28.083 --> 28:30.083
I said, "Go stand somewhere
and go to the park with a book and read it.

28:32.250 --> 28:34.791
Oh, my gosh.
You will attract women like flies.

28:34.875 --> 28:37.875
It's like having a puppy
but you have a book. So, read."

28:38.208 --> 28:40.041
What do you think is the problem

28:40.125 --> 28:43.458
when it comes to some black men
and their education?

28:43.541 --> 28:46.583
I don't mean all black men,
because we have intelligent black men

28:46.666 --> 28:49.583
we don't see in the media
as much as we see entertainers.

28:49.666 --> 28:51.666
So, what do you think
is the deficit or the problem

28:51.750 --> 28:54.583
when it comes to black men
going further with education?

28:54.666 --> 28:58.458
-They're not built like that.
-[Pinkard] What do you mean?

28:59.416 --> 29:03.416
They... [clicks tongue] I don't want
to say they take the easy way out.

29:03.875 --> 29:04.875
But, like...

29:07.500 --> 29:11.666
Really, if we black, only thing we know

29:12.000 --> 29:17.500
is either rapping, playing ball
or going to the streets.

29:18.166 --> 29:20.750
We don't grow up talking
about being a police

29:20.833 --> 29:22.708
-or a doctor.
-[Pinkard] Mmm-hmm.

29:22.791 --> 29:23.708
-We--
-And that's sad.

29:23.791 --> 29:25.125
Everybody say NBA.

29:25.208 --> 29:28.625
NBA, NFL, rapping.

29:28.708 --> 29:30.791
[Pinkard] Is it because
of what he said in this book?

29:30.875 --> 29:34.250
"If that's all I see,
then that's what I want to be."

29:34.333 --> 29:37.208
So if I'm only seeing
one ethnicity on TV,

29:37.291 --> 29:39.541
if I'm only seeing one ethnicity
that has everything,

29:39.625 --> 29:42.250
if I'm only seeing one ethnicity
that's prospering,

29:42.333 --> 29:46.250
that would make you feel inferior,
if that's all you see.

29:46.541 --> 29:47.541
Yeah.

29:47.625 --> 29:52.958
<i>She wants you to think, because she cares</i>
<i>for you as a person first,</i>

29:53.041 --> 29:54.250
<i>then a student.</i>

29:54.333 --> 29:56.791
In high school, I always got Ds and Fs.

29:56.875 --> 30:01.125
I never had an English teacher
that cares for me as a person.

30:01.375 --> 30:02.791
OK, now one holding the books up.

30:02.875 --> 30:04.958
<i>If you want to be a doctor,</i>
<i>she wants you to be that.</i>

30:05.041 --> 30:06.458
<i>If you want to be a football player,</i>

30:06.541 --> 30:08.416
she wants you to be
the smartest one.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.291
So, yes, sir.

30:19.625 --> 30:22.375
[newscaster] <i>The storm's eye</i>
<i>passed just to the northeast</i>

30:22.458 --> 30:26.416
<i>and its 180-mile-per-hour wind</i>
<i>toppled trees and power lines. </i>

30:26.500 --> 30:30.291
<i>Officials are still trying to get a grip</i>
<i>on the extent of the devastation.</i>

30:30.375 --> 30:33.708
<i>Nearly a million people</i>
<i>are without electricity...</i>

30:36.708 --> 30:38.291
-[Diaz] You have family there?
-Yep.

30:39.583 --> 30:40.750
[Diaz] How's your family?

30:40.833 --> 30:43.708
[Carlos] My mom said yesterday
the sun finally came out.

30:43.791 --> 30:44.916
Water's starting to go down.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.625
-How deep is the water?
-Got up to five, six feet.

30:48.708 --> 30:50.250
By my house, at least.

30:50.333 --> 30:53.791
There's another hurricane
brewing out in the Gulf now.

30:53.875 --> 30:55.041
Hurricane Irma or something.

30:55.125 --> 30:57.791
They're trying to see
if that one'll hit Houston, too.

30:58.375 --> 31:00.041
Man, I don't know.

31:01.208 --> 31:02.833
[Brown] <i>He's sitting over there.</i>

31:02.916 --> 31:05.041
<i>It's 5:45.</i>
<i>He's not even got his cleats on yet.</i>

31:06.291 --> 31:08.500
Carlos, come on.
I'm not begging you to play.

31:08.750 --> 31:12.375
Figure it out or go home.
And you late right now.

31:12.750 --> 31:15.250
Fucking same shit
I just told you about yesterday.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.250
You ain't changed shit.

31:17.958 --> 31:19.833
Told you we shouldn't have
brought him back.

31:21.958 --> 31:23.416
Come on!

31:23.958 --> 31:26.000
Are we taking him, Jesse?

31:26.208 --> 31:27.250
[Ornelas] What's that?

31:27.333 --> 31:28.791
Why are you over there, Coach?

31:28.875 --> 31:30.750
Are we taking him or is he a Roger?

31:31.166 --> 31:32.416
Yeah, Roger on this side.

31:32.500 --> 31:35.583
-[Brown] Man. Why do I gotta see it?
-I'm giving the huddle for the next play.

31:35.666 --> 31:37.041
-[Brown] Coach, shut up!
-Let's go.

31:37.125 --> 31:38.708
-[Brown] I can hear your mouth.
-Let's go!

31:38.791 --> 31:41.000
-[Brown] Hurry up, let's go!
-[player] Roger! Roger!

31:41.875 --> 31:43.333
[players exclaiming]

31:45.875 --> 31:47.125
[Bea] <i>We need you back, bro.</i>

31:47.208 --> 31:50.500
Next week. Next week for sure.

31:50.583 --> 31:53.583
-We need some shit to get organized.
-I got you.

31:54.625 --> 31:56.875
I'll try to work in the rest of this week.

31:56.958 --> 31:58.916
I'm gonna try pads on Thursday.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.333
-How's the shoulder coming?
-It's good.

32:01.416 --> 32:02.666
[Bea] <i>We need you back, man.</i>

32:02.750 --> 32:05.458
[Brown] Carlos, I brought you back
for this? Really?

32:05.541 --> 32:08.250
[Carlos] Nobody else I hear
saying nothing, but why is it on me?

32:08.333 --> 32:11.291
[Brown] Motherfucker, go home, then!
I don't give a fuck!

32:11.375 --> 32:13.041
I didn't bring you back for this shit!

32:13.250 --> 32:16.833
Fuck is all that? You're a grown man!
I still gotta beg you to practice?

32:17.500 --> 32:21.291
Take your ass home, man.
Ain't nobody sucking your dick.

32:21.375 --> 32:22.416
[Carlos] Man, Coach.

32:22.500 --> 32:24.583
Shut the fuck up, man. Take your ass home.

32:24.666 --> 32:27.541
[Carlos] Bro, he's always bitching.
He always bitching.

32:27.625 --> 32:30.333
Bye. Do the same shit you did
at Garden City.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.958
Same motherfucker.

32:32.041 --> 32:33.666
You the same dude, Carlos. Same dude.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.125
[Carlos] Underwater, bro.
My house underwater.

32:36.208 --> 32:38.458
And you doing this.

32:38.541 --> 32:41.291
[Carlos] You worried about 15 minutes
and my house underwater.

32:41.375 --> 32:43.041
So you gonna feel sorry
for everybody?

32:43.125 --> 32:45.375
Why don't you go help them out?

32:45.458 --> 32:47.166
Why don't you do right here
and go help them?

32:47.625 --> 32:49.291
I ain't dependent on your ass!

32:49.583 --> 32:52.625
Walk your ass back to the dorm!
Pack your shit!

32:52.916 --> 32:54.666
Get another wideout, Coach.

32:55.666 --> 32:57.875
Let's go, coaches.
I wanna play with winners!

32:57.958 --> 32:59.375
Fuck these loser motherfuckers!

32:59.875 --> 33:02.541
If these dudes don't wanna practice,
get the fuck out!

33:02.625 --> 33:05.375
I don't give a fuck who it is,
Malik Henry or whoever!

33:05.708 --> 33:08.166
These motherfuckers don't buy in,
get them out of here!

33:08.458 --> 33:09.833
I don't give a fuck who it is!

33:09.916 --> 33:12.375
You motherfucker,
I'm tired of sucking your dicks!

33:15.458 --> 33:16.541
This shit's dead. [groans]

33:22.750 --> 33:23.916
[Emmit] Come on, bro.

33:27.375 --> 33:28.208
[Carlos] Bro.

33:28.291 --> 33:29.791
[Emmit] Fuck with me, dog

33:29.875 --> 33:33.083
You're wasting your time if you want
to tell me to go back out there, buddy.

33:33.166 --> 33:35.333
Let me take you back. Come on.

33:35.416 --> 33:37.875
You're wasting your time if you
want me to come back out there.

33:37.958 --> 33:39.583
-Come on.
-You're wasting your time.

33:39.666 --> 33:40.625
You won't dab me up?

33:40.708 --> 33:42.875
-I dab you up. You're still my dog.
-Look...

33:44.458 --> 33:46.166
Fuck whatever he said.
I don't give a damn.

33:46.750 --> 33:51.666
I'm not going back out there, bro.
Y'all might as well go back to practice.

33:53.541 --> 33:56.500
-You know I love you.
-[Carlos] Love y'all boys. Peace out.

33:56.583 --> 33:57.583
We take care of family.

33:57.666 --> 33:58.791
[Carlos] You know it.

34:00.708 --> 34:03.916
-Hey. Take it easy.
-[Carlos] All right.

34:19.916 --> 34:23.375
[Brown] <i>There's two people that bitched</i>
<i>about practice structure</i>

34:23.458 --> 34:25.250
<i>because we went early in the morning.</i>

34:25.333 --> 34:28.083
<i>It was Malik Henry and Carlos Thompson.</i>

34:28.166 --> 34:30.375
<i>Skilled players</i>
<i>are always the prima donnas,</i>

34:30.458 --> 34:33.958
<i>and that's the reputation they have</i>
<i>throughout the history of football. </i>

34:34.041 --> 34:38.208
<i>Think they're better than the program.</i>
<i>No one is better than the program.</i>

34:38.625 --> 34:43.583
When you bring a ton of talent in
and you don't have a backup for them,

34:43.666 --> 34:48.041
they can really kind of hold you
at gunpoint, too.

34:48.125 --> 34:52.541
Because now you're screwed without 'em,
and you don't have a backup for 'em.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.208
So I gotta figure that out.

34:55.291 --> 34:59.750
But I won't be held hostage either.
I'll have to make a tough decision.

35:02.041 --> 35:04.000
<i>If we started a game tomorrow,</i>
<i>Malik would start.</i>

35:04.416 --> 35:05.583
Yeah, I know that.

35:05.666 --> 35:07.333
[Brown] Now, I need to find number two.

35:07.416 --> 35:08.791
-For sure, number two.
-Exactly.

35:08.875 --> 35:12.041
[Brown] You happen to be
behind a guy that has been trained

35:12.125 --> 35:14.041
by great guys since he was six.

35:14.125 --> 35:15.375
He was a stud in high school.

35:15.458 --> 35:19.250
A lot of high school guys, those stars
after your name, are overrated.

35:19.333 --> 35:20.416
[Bea] They mean nothing.

35:20.500 --> 35:23.500
He was a five star.
Malik has temper issues.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.000
Mmm-hmm. We've all seen that.

35:25.125 --> 35:30.583
So who says Malik don't throw the football
at the fucking referee's face.

35:30.666 --> 35:32.625
-You're coming in now.
-[chuckles] Exactly.

35:32.708 --> 35:34.166
There's a saying where I'm from.

35:34.250 --> 35:36.333
If you stay ready,
you ain't gotta get ready.

35:36.416 --> 35:37.708
-Okay.
-You know what I mean?

35:37.791 --> 35:39.041
Stay ready, man.

35:40.625 --> 35:43.375
<i>-You talk to him?</i>
<i>-I'm going to, yeah.</i>

35:43.916 --> 35:45.375
What about this weekend?

35:45.458 --> 35:47.625
He didn't practice.
Can't let him start.

35:50.875 --> 35:51.750
Let's see him today.

35:51.833 --> 35:54.041
[Brown] I've never sat a cat
because of an injury

35:54.125 --> 35:56.625
-if it was the truth.
-He did have the concussion protocol.

35:56.708 --> 35:58.875
[Brown] But he was there
every day on time.

35:58.958 --> 35:59.833
Yeah, he was.

35:59.916 --> 36:02.750
[Brown] Have a talk with him
and say this is my first and only,

36:02.833 --> 36:04.291
because Coach Brown's done with it.

36:04.375 --> 36:05.250
You know?

36:05.541 --> 36:07.750
[Diaz] <i>We can't motivate you all the time.</i>

36:08.250 --> 36:11.500
At some point, it's gotta come through
you guys to come out here and play.

36:12.458 --> 36:14.958
I need one guy to be a leader. One dude.

36:15.041 --> 36:18.541
One dude that's gonna check dudes.
Say, "Come on. Let's go."

36:19.208 --> 36:21.708
All these D-I bouncebacks
saying they're hard, man.

36:23.000 --> 36:28.583
Malik, I need you to step up, baby.
I know you have it inside you.

36:28.666 --> 36:31.125
You're a competitor. You want to win.

36:31.708 --> 36:33.791
-You gotta show it. Feel me?
-Yeah.

36:35.166 --> 36:37.625
[Diaz] I thought you were
gonna rise to the occasion.

36:37.875 --> 36:39.833
But I haven't seen it, Carlos.

36:40.625 --> 36:43.166
I know you have it inside.
You're the oldest cat in here,

36:43.250 --> 36:45.250
and I haven't seen you
check these guys.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.125
[Carlos] <i>The flood did all this damage.</i>

36:50.500 --> 36:54.833
The city, in some places,
still all the way underwater, though.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.416
They packed up everything downstairs,

36:57.500 --> 36:59.541
'cause they had a feeling
it was coming up,

36:59.625 --> 37:01.291
when it came up the driveway. The house and shit, that's material.

37:03.125 --> 37:06.125
As long as you got family,
you ain't lose everything,

37:06.541 --> 37:07.458
thank God.

37:09.583 --> 37:12.666
[Carlos] Don't you think
about what happened at practice?

37:12.750 --> 37:16.625
[Markiese] We had a good practice,
but it ain't the practice we need to have.

37:16.958 --> 37:20.625
'Cause when two of our starters
not practicing, what can we do?

37:20.833 --> 37:23.750
And when you two don't practice,
other people think they can't practice.

37:23.833 --> 37:26.625
When y'all two is out,
then Sean didn't wanna practice.

37:27.708 --> 37:28.958
I feel that, bro.

37:30.166 --> 37:33.375
If Coach Brown cuts you for real,
you know how much you gonna lose?

37:34.250 --> 37:36.458
Not just you. You know how... Man!

37:37.500 --> 37:40.958
Think about the money
your mama put in this.

37:42.041 --> 37:44.375
-For real.
-And the situation she in now.

37:47.166 --> 37:49.375
We do stuff out here we don't like.

37:50.708 --> 37:53.416
I hate practicing.
But it's a business trip.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.750
You gotta do it.

37:54.833 --> 37:56.291
Practice or go home.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.916
One question.
If you go home, what'll you do?

37:59.833 --> 38:01.125
I don't even know.

38:01.208 --> 38:03.000
Exactly. If I go home, know what I'll do?

38:03.083 --> 38:04.708
Fuck around, be in jail or dead.

38:06.166 --> 38:09.375
This a business trip,
and we gotta take advantage of it.

38:09.750 --> 38:12.625
[Carlos] I know, bro. I don't... [sighs]

38:12.708 --> 38:15.833
I gotta suck up my pride, bro.
That's all it is.

38:15.916 --> 38:20.000
All I can say is suck it up,
be a man and let's get out of here.

38:20.083 --> 38:23.083
Win that goddamn Natty,
and let's get out of here.

38:23.708 --> 38:24.666
For real, dog.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.041
Gas up.

38:26.291 --> 38:28.083
Always. [chuckles]

38:32.708 --> 38:35.250
-[Brown] All right, 'Los, what up?
-What's up, Coach?

38:35.333 --> 38:38.458
What you want to talk about, man?
You know where I'm at?

38:38.750 --> 38:42.708
-Yes, sir. I mean--
-[Brown] Now your legacy gonna end

38:42.791 --> 38:47.958
as the could-have-been dude who went
to Texas Tech, was an All-American,

38:48.833 --> 38:52.416
or the guy that got kicked out
of Indy in his third JUCO,

38:52.500 --> 38:54.041
fourth school overall.

38:54.250 --> 38:58.375
If you think about it, four schools, dog.
In how long? Three years?

38:58.625 --> 39:02.000
I'm the same dude that drove you
from Garden City to LA.

39:02.083 --> 39:03.041
-You know?
-Yes, sir.

39:03.125 --> 39:05.333
And took you to my beach house.
I'm the same guy.

39:05.416 --> 39:06.291
I ain't changed.

39:06.541 --> 39:09.208
But when are you gonna change, man?

39:09.291 --> 39:10.958
These dudes look up to you.

39:11.041 --> 39:14.291
They'll follow you going to the left
or to the right.

39:14.375 --> 39:18.291
-How am I gonna depend on you?
-I know I can get this right.

39:18.375 --> 39:22.458
I can come in and lead this team
in the way that they need to be led.

39:22.541 --> 39:25.000
-Well...
-I know I can do it, Coach.

39:25.083 --> 39:27.125
-You gotta show me.
-I am gonna do it.

39:27.625 --> 39:31.625
Then I come out one day later,
and you going the other way.

39:32.416 --> 39:34.958
-[stammers]
-Does that not disappoint you ever?

39:35.500 --> 39:38.125
-It does.
-Your own self, when you go home? Fuck.

39:38.833 --> 39:42.000
You're the only man in the household.
The last line of defense.

39:42.500 --> 39:44.541
You can't do for them if you ain't right.

39:44.958 --> 39:47.916
You have a legitimate shot
at making decent coin.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.333
But you're gonna let junior college,
Southeast Kansas,

39:52.416 --> 39:55.791
Western Kansas,
Riverside, California, stop you.

39:56.625 --> 40:02.000
At the moment, you are at a "show me,
not tell me" situation, so...

40:02.333 --> 40:05.333
When he says, "Seize the moment,"
he means right now.

40:06.416 --> 40:08.000
'Cause time flies, man.

40:08.083 --> 40:10.625
The moment last week was the first game.

40:11.083 --> 40:15.458
Do you know this season will be gone?
It's just a moment, man.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.750
Do the right thing for the moment,

40:17.833 --> 40:20.041
and for the rest of your life
you'll be glad you did.

40:20.125 --> 40:21.000
[Brown] Mmm-hmm.

40:21.083 --> 40:23.333
[Latson] You'll be glad that you did, man.

40:23.833 --> 40:25.750
[Harris] <i>You're all set?</i> [grunts]

40:27.750 --> 40:30.041

I'm here to help you, man.
And you're giving me half-assed effort.

I told him this is his last hoorah.

43:08.958 --> 43:10.958
He walked off the field yesterday.

43:11.041 --> 43:14.875
He reflected, he came in, he apologized,
he's gonna pay the price.

43:14.958 --> 43:17.083
But he wanted to holler at you
so you understand.

43:17.166 --> 43:20.416
I wanted to say I'm sorry.
I let the team down.

43:20.500 --> 43:23.458

I let y'all down.

I also want to say, bro, this real shit.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.791
I'm disappointed in myself,
'cause before today,

43:31.875 --> 43:34.041
I hadn't fully bought in to the team.
I'm being real.

43:34.125 --> 43:35.750
I was half-assing it.

43:54.458 --> 43:55.500
We know what happened.

43:55.791 --> 43:59.041
But if we get this brotherhood stuff going
and we get this down as a team,

43:59.125 --> 44:00.625
we could do something special.

44:00.708 --> 44:02.666
-We could run the table, nine and one.
-Yeah.
