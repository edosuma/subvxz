01:48.900 --> 01:50.902
Nick Nack! Tabasco!

01:51.153 --> 01:54.948
Right away, Monsieur Scaramanga!

02:19.681 --> 02:22.476
Hey.

02:23.852 --> 02:28.357
Half. You get the rest later.

02:34.071 --> 02:38.242
Wait for him in there. Through that door.

02:40.036 --> 02:43.498
He will join you in a minute.

03:11.484 --> 03:16.155
Your steam bath is ready,
Monsieur Scaramanga.

04:18.636 --> 04:22.432
"Oh, that would have been too easy."

04:22.599 --> 04:25.977
"It's locked."

04:26.227 --> 04:30.523
You'll have to look elsewhere, monsieur.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.944
Hey, Al.

05:57.194 --> 06:02.158
Al, wherever you are,
don't hold it against me.

06:08.874 --> 06:13.546
I wonder where you can find your gun,
Monsieur Scaramanga.

06:13.754 --> 06:17.967
"Your little golden gun."

06:20.887 --> 06:24.557
"Where can it be?"

06:26.017 --> 06:30.271
"There is something
we haven't had before."

06:31.731 --> 06:35.318
"I wonder what it can be."

06:39.071 --> 06:42.742
"I fooled you!"

06:46.120 --> 06:49.707
"You're getting warmer."

06:51.209 --> 06:54.837
"Much warmer."

07:18.152 --> 07:22.699
Now, how are you going
to get down the stairs?

07:22.908 --> 07:27.579
"So near and yet so far."

07:50.102 --> 07:52.646
"Bravo, Monsieur Scaramanga."

07:52.896 --> 07:56.525
You've done it again.

07:58.861 --> 08:02.656
- This one was the best, "n'est-ce pas"?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

08:02.906 --> 08:05.659
But you'll have to do better
to come into my money.

08:05.909 --> 08:09.955
I'll get you yet,
and I'll enjoy every sou you leave me.

08:10.205 --> 08:14.042
You'll be the death of me yet, Nick Nack.

08:39.318 --> 08:42.405
"He has a powerful weapon"

08:42.655 --> 08:46.409
"He charges a million a shot"

08:46.659 --> 08:50.914
"An assassin that's second to none"

08:55.168 --> 08:58.296
"Lurking in some darkened doorway"

08:58.546 --> 09:01.925
"Or crouched on a rooftop somewhere"

09:02.175 --> 09:05.345
"In the next room, or this very one"

09:05.595 --> 09:10.643
"The Man with the Golden Gun"

09:10.893 --> 09:14.230
"Love is required whenever he's hired"

09:14.480 --> 09:17.566
"It comes just before the kill"

09:17.775 --> 09:19.527
"No one can catch him"

09:19.735 --> 09:21.195
"No hit man can match him"

09:21.445 --> 09:24.323
"For his million-dollar skill"

09:24.615 --> 09:28.202
"One golden shot
means another poor victim"

09:28.452 --> 09:32.414
"Has come to a glittering end"

09:32.665 --> 09:35.292
"For a price, he'll erase anyone"

09:35.543 --> 09:39.713
"The Man with the Golden Gun"

09:39.964 --> 09:47.638
"His eye may be on you or me"

09:47.888 --> 09:52.269
"Who will he bang?"

09:52.519 --> 10:00.110
"We shall see"

10:03.029 --> 10:06.241
"Love is required whenever he's hired"

10:06.491 --> 10:09.744
"It comes just before the kill"

10:09.995 --> 10:11.371
"No one can catch him"

10:11.663 --> 10:13.206
"No hit man can match him"

10:13.415 --> 10:16.376
"For his million-dollar skill"

10:16.626 --> 10:20.380
"One golden shot
means another poor victim"

10:20.589 --> 10:24.426
"Has come to a glittering end"

10:24.634 --> 10:27.429
"If you want to get rid of someone"

10:27.637 --> 10:30.515
"The Man with the Golden Gun"

10:30.724 --> 10:33.727
"Will get it done"

10:33.977 --> 10:37.230
"He'll shoot anyone"

10:37.481 --> 10:46.656
"With his golden gun"

10:52.329 --> 10:55.957
Good morning, sir.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.960
Colthorpe.

10:59.169 --> 11:00.837
Chief of Staff.

11:01.087 --> 11:03.716
What do you know
about a man called Scaramanga, 007?

11:03.966 --> 11:07.595
Scaramanga?

11:07.887 --> 11:10.723
Oh, yes! The Man with the Golden Gun.

11:10.973 --> 11:15.520
Born in a circus. Father, the ringmaster.
Mother, English. A snake charmer.

11:15.812 --> 11:21.359
A spectacular trick-shot artist by the time
he was ten and a local Rio gunman at 15.

11:21.567 --> 11:25.196
The KGB trained him in Europe,
where he became

11:25.446 --> 11:27.573
an overworked, underpaid assassin.

11:27.824 --> 11:30.326
He went independent in the '50s.

11:30.576 --> 11:32.829
Current price: One million dollars a hit.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.248
No... er... photograph on file.

11:35.498 --> 11:40.378
But he does have one distinguishing
feature, however. A superfluous papilla.

11:40.628 --> 11:45.758
- A what?
- A mammary gland. A third nipple, sir.

11:45.967 --> 11:49.262
He always uses a golden bullet,
hence "Man with the Golden Gun".

11:49.512 --> 11:51.514
Present domicile unknown.

11:51.764 --> 11:54.433
I think that's all.

11:54.684 --> 11:58.437
Why, sir?

11:59.272 --> 12:02.608
Hm! Charming trinket.

12:02.859 --> 12:05.279
- Even has my number on it.
- Precisely.

12:05.571 --> 12:08.323
Obviously it's useless as a bullet.

12:08.615 --> 12:11.201
Who would pay a million dollars
to have me killed?

12:11.410 --> 12:16.206
Jealous husbands, outraged chefs,
humiliated tailors. The list is endless.

12:16.416 --> 12:19.460
Moreover, this trinket, as you call it,

12:19.669 --> 12:24.132
was sent with a note
requesting "special delivery" to you.

12:24.382 --> 12:28.428
- It's initialled with an S.
- Scaramanga's fingerprints were on it.

12:28.636 --> 12:31.222
They've been verified by the CIA.

12:31.473 --> 12:34.642
- Why would he alert me?
- Psychological.

12:34.851 --> 12:37.896
He counts on his reputation
to terrify his intended victim.

12:38.188 --> 12:41.816
Thank you, gentlemen.

12:49.532 --> 12:54.412
I'm relieving you
of your present assignment, 007.

12:56.122 --> 12:58.750
- Er, sir?
- Yes?

12:59.042 --> 13:02.295
The energy crisis is still with us.

13:02.545 --> 13:07.967
I submit that finding Gibson and his solar
cell data is more important than ever.

13:08.218 --> 13:10.220
It is indeed.

13:10.428 --> 13:17.435
And I can't jeopardise it or any mission
by having Scaramanga put a bullet in you.

13:17.644 --> 13:21.064
I'll endorse your request to resign.

13:21.314 --> 13:24.776
Or you can take a sabbatical
and go to ground until this is settled.

13:25.068 --> 13:26.361
Or until he kills me.

13:26.611 --> 13:29.572
Nobody knows where he is
or what he looks like.

13:29.781 --> 13:34.286
So I think it's fair to assume
that he has the edge on you.

13:34.537 --> 13:38.833
Wouldn't you agree? That's all, 007.

13:46.841 --> 13:49.218
If I found him first, sir,

13:49.510 --> 13:52.304
that might change the situation.

13:52.596 --> 13:57.560
Dramatically, wouldn't you say?

13:57.935 --> 14:00.980
Good day, Bond.

14:07.736 --> 14:09.613
Moneypenny, Fairbanks.

14:09.905 --> 14:12.992
- Alaska.
- No. Bill Fairbanks, 002.

14:13.242 --> 14:14.952
Oh, poor Bill.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.705
- I miss him.
- The Man with the Golden Gun didn't.

14:17.997 --> 14:20.291
Officially that was never confirmed.

14:20.499 --> 14:22.668
Where was 002 when it happened?

14:22.918 --> 14:25.171
Beirut, '69.

14:25.421 --> 14:27.882
In a cabaret with a lady called Saida.

14:28.174 --> 14:29.967
Beirut, hm?

14:30.259 --> 14:32.720
Moneypenny,
you are better than a computer.

14:32.970 --> 14:36.056
In all sorts of ways.

14:36.348 --> 14:38.684
But you never take advantage of them.

14:38.893 --> 14:42.771
"- Miss Moneypenny.
- Yes, sir."

14:43.522 --> 14:46.026
Oh, just one moment, darling.

14:46.276 --> 14:47.611
Yes, James?

14:47.861 --> 14:50.739
Why wasn't Scaramanga
confirmed as the killer?

14:50.989 --> 14:55.202
Because they couldn't find the bullet!

14:55.744 --> 14:59.122
Darling!

15:27.819 --> 15:29.362
Ahmed.

15:29.612 --> 15:32.990
Ahmed!

16:11.822 --> 16:14.408
"Entrez."

16:14.658 --> 16:20.414
Good evening.
My name is Bond. James Bond.

16:20.956 --> 16:23.500
Your dancing is superb.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.421
"- And so are you.
- Merci."

16:29.756 --> 16:32.759
And you are very handsome.

16:33.010 --> 16:39.516
Well, I don't usually intrude like this,
but I... I believe we had a mutual friend.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.936
- Bill Fairbanks.
- Fairbanks?

16:43.187 --> 16:44.730
Yes.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.858
I am told you were with him

16:48.066 --> 16:50.903
when he was rather, er...
rudely interrupted.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.030
Ah, "mais oui" - Bill!

16:53.280 --> 16:56.200
What a terrible night. I will never forget it.

16:56.450 --> 16:59.453
- Did you see who shot him?
- No, I was in his arms.

16:59.703 --> 17:03.499
- My eyes were closed.
- At least he died happy.

17:03.749 --> 17:06.752
The bullet went through him.

17:07.044 --> 17:11.589
- Through his back and ended up there?
- No, no, through his neck.

17:11.799 --> 17:14.803
I take it out of the wall
before the police arrive.

17:15.094 --> 17:17.806
And now it is my lucky charm.

17:18.056 --> 17:20.767
I never dance without it.

17:21.017 --> 17:24.896
I'm sure Bill would have loved that.

17:26.481 --> 17:29.067
But let us forget the past.

17:29.359 --> 17:32.570
Mm! I was hoping you'd say that.

17:32.779 --> 17:34.697
Are you staying long in Beirut?

17:34.948 --> 17:38.618
Oh, it depends.

17:55.886 --> 17:59.473
Clumsy of me.

18:07.648 --> 18:12.611
You really do have
a magnificent abdomen.

18:21.078 --> 18:25.584
Oh, my perfumes! No!

19:37.864 --> 19:41.160
I've lost my charm!

19:41.410 --> 19:45.039
Not from where "I'm" standing.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.213
Taxi? Hotel, mister?

19:52.463 --> 19:56.717
No. To the nearest pharmacy.

19:58.511 --> 20:00.388
Dumdum bullets like this

20:00.638 --> 20:03.724
flatten on impact
for maximum wounding effect.

20:03.975 --> 20:06.853
- Very nasty.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.

20:07.103 --> 20:09.522
But just tell me
where it was made and by whom.

20:09.772 --> 20:12.608
Well, fortunately it's all in one piece.

20:12.859 --> 20:15.153
20.003 grams.

20:15.403 --> 20:18.781
Which leads us to deduce
it was fired from a 4.2 millimetre gun.

20:19.031 --> 20:21.909
Colthorpe, there's no such thing
as a 4.2 millimetre gun.

20:22.160 --> 20:26.998
The fact that no recognised munitions
manufacturer, military or civil,

20:27.248 --> 20:31.127
produces such a bullet
doesn't mean it doesn't exist, 007.

20:31.377 --> 20:35.464
Q Branch have been making irregular
calibres for most unusual purposes.

20:35.715 --> 20:41.304
- And we don't put markings on them.
- Making identification almost impossible.

20:41.554 --> 20:45.808
You mean we can't trace it? You've
no idea what it went through to get here.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.227
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

20:48.478 --> 20:51.815
The workmanship is undemanding
according to our standards.

20:52.065 --> 20:56.196
Soft 23-carat gold with traces of... nickel.

20:56.446 --> 20:59.157
Hardly ever used in Europe.
Comes from India.

20:59.407 --> 21:02.035
Far East?

21:02.327 --> 21:06.831
- Why not India?
- Nickel content obviously too low, 007.

21:07.040 --> 21:10.793
- Lazar?
- Lazar!

21:11.044 --> 21:13.671
Hm. Imaginative.

21:13.922 --> 21:15.840
Highly specialised.

21:16.090 --> 21:20.011
Yes, I concur.

21:23.181 --> 21:26.935
- Well, what the hell is Lazar?
- Not what. Who. Portuguese.

21:27.185 --> 21:33.358
- Lives in Macau.
- Chap who made the bullet, 007.

21:57.590 --> 22:03.429
I hate to interrupt your dinner,
but does Senhor Lazar live here?

22:04.722 --> 22:08.102
Lazar.

22:09.728 --> 22:14.233
I was given this address. Does he...

22:14.483 --> 22:18.112
Senhor Lazar?

22:18.279 --> 22:20.906
My name's Bond. James Bond.

22:21.157 --> 22:23.868
An unexpected honour, Mr Bond.

22:24.118 --> 22:28.539
Your reputation precedes you.
This way, please.

22:32.418 --> 22:36.755
It would be my proudest moment if
I could make something for you, Mr Bond.

22:37.047 --> 22:38.716
A rifle, perhaps.

22:39.008 --> 22:42.595
Now, here we have
an interesting problem.

22:42.803 --> 22:46.015
A custom-built model for a client

22:46.265 --> 22:49.185
who recently lost two fingers. Please.

22:49.435 --> 22:52.813
- Also lost his trigger.
- It is housed in the butt.

22:53.022 --> 22:56.692
Squeeze it.

23:06.243 --> 23:08.537
The sights are a bit off.

23:08.787 --> 23:13.042
You have five fingers. The butt
is balanced for the pressure of three.

23:13.250 --> 23:16.504
That is why you were one inch too low.

23:16.795 --> 23:20.842
Here you will find only
craftsmanship and quality.

23:21.092 --> 23:23.220
Mass production,

23:23.428 --> 23:26.515
your Walther PPK, for instance,
I leave to others.

23:26.807 --> 23:28.308
What about ammunition?

23:28.517 --> 23:32.020
Designed to individual requirements,
whatever they may be.

23:32.270 --> 23:34.731
In gold... if I wanted?

23:35.023 --> 23:38.652
- I have already done that for a client.
- I know you have.

23:38.902 --> 23:42.572
Francisco Scaramanga.

23:42.989 --> 23:47.703
My relationship with a client, Mr Bond,
is strictly confidential.

23:47.954 --> 23:50.081
Like a doctor. A priest with a penitent.

23:50.373 --> 23:52.750
Oh, of course!

23:52.917 --> 23:55.503
Yet you make guns
for fingerless hoodlums,

23:55.753 --> 23:57.463
bullets for assassins.

23:57.713 --> 24:02.468
Mr Bond, bullets do not kill.
It is the finger that pulls the trigger.

24:02.718 --> 24:06.097
Exactly!

24:06.138 --> 24:10.476
I'm now aiming precisely at your groin.

24:10.768 --> 24:13.229
So speak or for ever hold your peace.

24:13.479 --> 24:15.022
I have never seen him.

24:15.231 --> 24:19.443
On a cost-per-bullet basis,
he must be your best customer.

24:19.735 --> 24:23.322
True, but unfortunately
he only fires them occasionally.

24:23.573 --> 24:27.285
When was the, er... last shipment?

24:27.493 --> 24:31.164
This is impossible. I can't...

24:32.248 --> 24:34.626
You're quite right.

24:34.835 --> 24:38.505
An inch too low.

24:41.842 --> 24:45.554
I have just completed an order
for immediate delivery.

24:45.762 --> 24:48.056
- Who collects them?
- I swear, I do not know.

24:48.348 --> 24:53.896
My instructions are to go to the casino.
I am paid and they vanish.

25:46.198 --> 25:50.078
"In a few moments we will be
in Hong Kong harbour,"

25:50.370 --> 25:52.372
"one of the busiest ports in the world."

25:52.622 --> 25:55.792
"May I remind you to have
passports and landing cards ready,"

25:56.000 --> 26:00.046
"in order to avoid unnecessary delay."

26:08.054 --> 26:11.724
"On your left is the wreckage
of the famous liner Queen Elizabeth,"

26:11.975 --> 26:16.980
"which sank here under
mysterious circumstances in 1971."

26:17.188 --> 26:23.862
"Ahead, you can now see Kowloon,
and on your right, Hong Kong Island."

26:43.924 --> 26:47.595
Taxi!

26:49.305 --> 26:52.933
Follow that Rolls.

26:56.020 --> 26:59.523
Madam, would you be good enough
to move this inverted bedpan?

26:59.773 --> 27:04.279
Sorry I'm late, James, but your signal
from Macau just reached the office.

27:04.529 --> 27:06.531
You're a great help, Goodnight.

27:06.823 --> 27:12.120
Now, get on to Licence Bureau
and trace that car. AU 603, a green Rolls.

27:12.370 --> 27:14.122
A green Rolls?

27:14.372 --> 27:16.708
A green Rolls-Royce.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.129
There can't be that many in Hong Kong.

27:23.340 --> 27:27.552
Courtesy cars. All green Rolls-Royces
belong to the Peninsula Hotel.

27:27.802 --> 27:32.224
You see what a two-year posting
to Staff Intelligence does for a girl?

27:32.432 --> 27:35.769
James, it's wonderful to see you.

27:36.019 --> 27:40.899
- Where are you going?
- I need some information.

27:47.823 --> 27:50.492
The subject under surveillance
is in room 602.

27:50.700 --> 27:54.412
I'll buy you dinner, but first
I have official business to attend to.

27:54.704 --> 27:57.290
Yes, I saw the "official business".

27:57.541 --> 28:00.794
Goodnight, would I do that to you
after two years?

28:01.002 --> 28:04.589
Yes, you bloody well would!

28:08.385 --> 28:10.303
- Please.
- I can manage.

28:10.554 --> 28:14.641
You could open a door for me, though.

28:19.522 --> 28:21.858
- I open champagne?
- No, it's a surprise.

28:22.150 --> 28:25.736
Oh! A surprise!

29:24.670 --> 29:28.257
Good afternoon.

29:35.557 --> 29:39.854
- A water pistol?
- Pass me that robe.

29:47.695 --> 29:51.324
Turn around.

29:51.825 --> 29:55.995
Do you always take a shower
with a pistol?

29:59.165 --> 30:03.044
Put your hands up and get out of here!

30:07.507 --> 30:12.595
- Keep on walking.
- But you haven't answered my question.

30:22.147 --> 30:24.649
"Reception. Can I help you?"

30:24.816 --> 30:27.986
This is Miss Anders. Room 602.

30:28.236 --> 30:30.446
Put those down!

30:30.697 --> 30:33.575
I see why these packets carry
a government warning.

30:33.825 --> 30:36.953
Give me that!

30:37.203 --> 30:41.291
They certainly can damage your health.

30:44.003 --> 30:47.506
- Ow! You're hurting my arm.
- Then tell me where those bullets go.

30:47.756 --> 30:50.926
- No, I can't.
- Try!

30:51.177 --> 30:54.847
- He'll kill me!
- Who?

30:55.890 --> 30:58.726
I can't tell you!

30:58.976 --> 31:02.396
Scaramanga.

31:04.315 --> 31:08.110
You see what you can do when you try?

31:09.487 --> 31:12.198
You work for him?

31:12.448 --> 31:16.035
I don't work for him.

31:16.952 --> 31:18.662
He's, um... I'm his...

31:18.913 --> 31:21.707
Oh. So he's a lover too.

31:21.957 --> 31:24.084
Only before he kills.

31:24.293 --> 31:28.214
Bullfighters do the same thing.
Claims it improves the eye.

31:28.464 --> 31:31.383
His eye is on me. Where can I find him?

31:31.675 --> 31:33.761
I don't know.

31:34.011 --> 31:35.554
I don't know.

31:35.804 --> 31:36.889
I said where?!

31:37.139 --> 31:39.350
I don't know!
He doesn't tell me everything.

31:39.558 --> 31:43.312
I know he has a date
at the Bottoms Up Club tonight.

31:43.521 --> 31:45.606
How will I recognise him?

31:45.898 --> 31:48.859
- Tall, slim and dark.
- So is my aunt.

31:49.109 --> 31:53.113
- Anything distinctive about him?
- Yes, but how can I...

31:53.364 --> 31:55.783
He is not like other people. He has three...

31:56.033 --> 31:57.535
Oh.

31:57.744 --> 32:03.166
Fascinating anatomical titbit, but the most
useless piece of information I ever heard.

32:03.416 --> 32:09.714
Unless the Bottoms Up is a strip club
and Scaramanga is performing there.

32:10.215 --> 32:13.426
You'll have to do better.

32:14.135 --> 32:17.848
He usually wears
a white linen suit, black tie,

32:18.056 --> 32:21.184
and jewellery, all gold.

32:21.476 --> 32:23.186
You're improving.

32:23.478 --> 32:27.524
I don't want you to twist my arm again.

32:27.566 --> 32:29.609
I don't want to either.

32:29.860 --> 32:32.445
So I'll tell you what you're going to do.

32:32.737 --> 32:36.284
You're going to take the bullets
to Mr Scaramanga,

32:36.492 --> 32:41.956
because, if he doesn't get them,
he may not show up at the Bottoms Up.

32:42.248 --> 32:45.126
And I want him there.

32:45.376 --> 32:48.546
- Why should you trust me?
- I don't.

32:48.754 --> 32:54.051
But neither will Mr Scaramanga, if he
hears about this interesting conversation.

32:54.302 --> 33:00.057
Who knows? He may even use
one of those little golden bullets on you.

33:00.474 --> 33:02.393
And that would be a pity,

33:02.643 --> 33:06.522
because they're "very" expensive.

33:06.647 --> 33:09.442
I'll take them to him.

33:09.692 --> 33:13.322
Let's drink to that.

33:15.324 --> 33:18.952
Bottoms up!

33:26.460 --> 33:30.923
- Soda or ginger ale?
- Ginger ale, please.

35:54.236 --> 35:56.571
Police! Drop it!

35:56.822 --> 35:58.949
Drop it!

35:59.199 --> 36:02.828
You're under arrest.

36:07.415 --> 36:11.002
Move away from there!

36:14.089 --> 36:18.343
If you take the trouble to examine
that gun, you'll notice it hasn't been fired.

36:18.635 --> 36:23.515
Anything you have to say,
you can say at the station.

36:28.979 --> 36:32.858
I'm charging him under Section 473.

36:44.828 --> 36:49.374
- I didn't see your identity card.
- You will.

37:05.141 --> 37:06.225
Here.

37:06.517 --> 37:11.606
- I thought we were going to the station.
- Kowloon side.

38:51.457 --> 38:54.335
Kowloon's over there!

38:54.586 --> 38:59.132
We're going to the New Territories!

39:41.300 --> 39:46.597
"Welcome aboard, Commander Bond."

39:48.432 --> 39:52.061
"This way, sir."

39:54.939 --> 39:58.567
"Down the hatchway, please."

40:02.655 --> 40:05.241
Good evening, sir.

40:05.491 --> 40:09.119
Would you follow me, please?

40:14.667 --> 40:16.627
It certainly gives you a new slant.

40:16.877 --> 40:20.256
What with the Chinese on one side
and the US fleet on the other,

40:20.506 --> 40:24.343
down here's the only place
in Hong Kong you can't be bugged.

40:24.593 --> 40:29.765
And with current real-estate prices
in Hong Kong, quite practical. Any luck?

40:30.015 --> 40:33.644
A Chinese fighter we salvaged.

40:40.569 --> 40:42.612
Good evening, 007.

40:42.863 --> 40:46.616
Glad to see you're still with us.

40:52.414 --> 40:56.668
In future, Commander Bond, if you must
tour the world of Suzie Wong by night,

40:56.918 --> 41:00.130
- inform our man here. Lieutenant Hip.
- Sorry, Commander.

41:00.380 --> 41:05.427
I had to get you away from the police,
but didn't know how much you knew.

41:05.635 --> 41:06.970
Nothing.

41:07.220 --> 41:11.766
But I should report, sir, that Scaramanga
does not have a contract on me.

41:12.058 --> 41:16.188
He couldn't have missed me tonight.
Instead he hit a chap at a club.

41:16.479 --> 41:21.693
- I got a shock when I saw who it was.
- I should think you did.

41:21.903 --> 41:24.989
Our missing solar-energy expert: Gibson.

41:25.281 --> 41:29.911
Yes. Gibson. He was prepared
to come back under certain conditions.

41:30.119 --> 41:32.538
That's why I'm here
with Professor Frazier.

41:32.788 --> 41:36.375
Lieutenant Hip
was making a preliminary contact.

41:36.626 --> 41:42.048
I almost wish that Scaramanga
had a contract on you.

41:42.131 --> 41:43.799
Was Gibson cooperative?

41:44.050 --> 41:48.555
He wanted to bargain for immunity.
Suggested another meeting in Bangkok.

41:48.805 --> 41:52.309
- Why Bangkok?
- I think he worked there for Hai Fat.

41:52.518 --> 41:54.061
That name's come up before.

41:54.311 --> 41:57.231
A multimillionaire.
Head of Hai Fat Enterprises.

41:57.481 --> 41:59.441
All legitimate, as far as we know.

41:59.650 --> 42:02.361
What did Gibson
propose bargaining with?

42:02.569 --> 42:05.614
A solex. Claimed it was 95% efficient.

42:05.864 --> 42:09.827
If he developed a solar cell that efficient,
he solved the energy crisis.

42:10.118 --> 42:11.787
So you've told me.

42:12.079 --> 42:15.499
Coal and oil will soon be depleted.
Uranium's too dangerous.

42:15.749 --> 42:19.378
Geothermal and tidal control
too expensive. I know all that.

42:19.628 --> 42:22.881
- Where's the solex now?
- Solex "agitator", sir.

42:23.173 --> 42:27.052
"The" essential unit to convert
radiation from the sun into electricity

42:27.344 --> 42:30.013
on an industrial basis. It's only that size.

42:30.305 --> 42:34.476
It won't take long to check out Gibson's
efficiency claim. This is exciting!

42:34.726 --> 42:37.563
May I see it, Lieutenant?

42:37.813 --> 42:41.900
He showed it to me at the bar
and replaced it in his pocket.

42:42.150 --> 42:44.903
And after he was shot,

42:45.153 --> 42:47.656
it wasn't there.

42:47.906 --> 42:50.701
I looked.

42:50.951 --> 42:53.120
Gentlemen, I congratulate you.

42:53.370 --> 42:55.998
Instead of getting a perfected solex,

42:56.248 --> 42:59.459
we're left with a useless corpse
and no leads.

42:59.668 --> 43:02.213
One lead, sir.

43:02.463 --> 43:05.592
Assuming Gibson
was killed by Scaramanga,

43:05.842 --> 43:08.845
whoever hired him
could afford a million dollars.

43:09.137 --> 43:12.432
- Are you suggesting Hai Fat?
- He could afford it.

43:12.682 --> 43:14.726
Out of petty cash.

43:14.976 --> 43:17.145
A thought has occurred to me.

43:17.395 --> 43:20.231
If Hai Fat hired Scaramanga,

43:20.481 --> 43:23.735
- it's unlikely that he met him personally.
- Why?

43:23.943 --> 43:27.614
If anything had gone wrong,
there's nothing to connect the two.

43:27.864 --> 43:30.742
That gives me an idea
as to how to approach him.

43:30.992 --> 43:35.705
Q, I'll... need this.

43:36.873 --> 43:41.211
- Really, 007!
- Oh, I admit it's a little kinky.

43:41.461 --> 43:45.131
You'll take Miss Goodnight with you.

43:45.340 --> 43:48.134
- Goodnight, sir?
- After tonight's debacle,

43:48.343 --> 43:53.556
an efficient liaison officer
wouldn't come amiss.

43:53.932 --> 43:55.600
Thank you, sir.

43:55.892 --> 43:57.560
You won't get near Hai Fat.

43:57.810 --> 44:00.855
I have relatives in Bangkok.
I have often passed his place.

44:01.147 --> 44:05.735
He lives in a house on a mountain
surrounded by guards.

44:48.572 --> 44:51.616
No way!
The place is crawling with guards.

44:51.908 --> 44:55.495
Have a look.

44:59.916 --> 45:02.460
Hai Fat takes his privacy very seriously.

45:02.669 --> 45:06.131
I'm sure he'll see me.

45:28.904 --> 45:31.741
Good morning. How's the water?

45:31.949 --> 45:33.910
Why don't you come in and find out?

45:34.118 --> 45:37.914
- Sounds very tempting, Miss, er...
- Chew Mee.

45:38.080 --> 45:40.041
Really?

45:40.333 --> 45:43.586
There's only one problem.
I have no swimming trunks.

45:43.878 --> 45:46.714
Neither have I.

45:47.006 --> 45:50.384
What are you doing here?

45:51.928 --> 45:55.431
Get out!

45:55.681 --> 45:57.016
Immediately.

45:57.266 --> 46:00.520
I will have you...

46:08.319 --> 46:12.573
Please forgive me, Mr Scaramanga.

46:14.158 --> 46:16.661
Excuse me, Chew Mee.

46:16.869 --> 46:20.289
Bye-ee.

46:20.456 --> 46:23.709
You understand my surprise.

46:23.918 --> 46:27.588
I thought it was understood.

46:27.964 --> 46:30.967
We were never to meet, Mr Scaramanga.

46:31.217 --> 46:33.511
I always thought
your abnormality was a myth.

46:33.845 --> 46:38.307
Some cults consider it a sign of
invulnerability and great sexual prowess.

46:38.516 --> 46:41.143
I've learned to live with it.

46:41.394 --> 46:43.312
Why are you here?

46:43.564 --> 46:45.274
Bond. James Bond.

46:45.524 --> 46:48.735
- Do I know the gentleman?
- Well, he knows you.

46:49.027 --> 46:53.240
Without being immodest, there are few
people in this part of the world who don't.

46:53.448 --> 46:56.535
And there are very few people
who haven't heard of Bond.

46:56.785 --> 47:00.289
British Secret Service,
007, licensed to kill.

47:00.497 --> 47:03.375
He's good, even by my standards.

47:03.584 --> 47:06.879
- He was near the Bottoms Up Club.
- A coincidence.

47:07.129 --> 47:09.173
I don't believe in them.

47:09.464 --> 47:11.800
The man's a menace.
He knows something.

47:12.050 --> 47:15.805
Are you suggesting I invest
another million to remove him?

47:16.055 --> 47:17.849
That's up to you.

47:18.099 --> 47:20.185
I will give it some thought.

47:20.435 --> 47:25.190
Since you have chosen to meet me,
perhaps you will dine here tonight.

47:25.440 --> 47:28.318
- I'll be delighted.
- Nine o'clock, then.

47:28.568 --> 47:33.990
Ling Po, see this gentleman out.

47:45.752 --> 47:47.712
Don't tell me you saw him?!

47:48.004 --> 47:50.131
He even invited me to dinner.

47:50.423 --> 47:54.594
He must have found me quite titillating.

48:11.153 --> 48:16.367
In due time, I shall be laid to rest
here in my mausoleum

48:16.659 --> 48:19.411
after a useful, happy, long life.

48:19.703 --> 48:25.334
And I do not intend
to allow Mr Bond to shorten it.

48:31.507 --> 48:33.425
I'll get the car.

48:33.676 --> 48:38.389
- You know I'd rather be dining with you.
- I understand, James. Please hurry back.

48:38.639 --> 48:42.059
I'll ring as soon as I do.
A midnight snack might be just the thing.

48:42.268 --> 48:44.895
I'll keep the wine properly chilled.

48:45.145 --> 48:48.941
And everything else warm, I trust.

48:55.322 --> 48:56.991
Bye-bye!

48:57.283 --> 49:00.870
And everything else warm?!

49:01.704 --> 49:04.832
I hope you don't mind
giving my nieces a lift.

49:05.082 --> 49:08.252
Good evening.

49:14.092 --> 49:17.721
Hai Fat's is on the way.

49:23.018 --> 49:26.897
I'll drop the girls, come back and wait.

49:27.272 --> 49:30.901
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

49:39.868 --> 49:44.456
The name's Scaramanga.
Mr Fat is expecting me.

50:05.393 --> 50:09.022
Grislyland.

50:32.089 --> 50:35.509
A pleasant evening.

51:22.431 --> 51:26.059
Get him! Come on!

51:34.985 --> 51:38.655
Stop it!

51:38.740 --> 51:41.951
Not here.

51:42.493 --> 51:45.205
This is my home.

51:45.497 --> 51:49.209
Take Mr Bond to school.

52:02.722 --> 52:06.142
Heaven.

52:07.310 --> 52:11.606
Definitely heaven.

54:06.599 --> 54:10.353
Tashman.

55:32.561 --> 55:35.939
Chula.

55:36.982 --> 55:41.987
Chula! Chula! Chula!

56:02.467 --> 56:06.971
Chula! Chula! Chula!

56:55.229 --> 56:56.522
Are you all right?

56:56.772 --> 57:01.277
- How did you find me?
- Hai Fat owns this place.

57:08.075 --> 57:11.453
Stand back, girls.

57:24.300 --> 57:26.218
Forgot to tell you!

57:26.510 --> 57:31.140
Their father runs a karate school.

58:29.366 --> 58:32.369
Hang on!

58:57.603 --> 59:02.067
What you might call
a Mexican screw-up, gentlemen!

59:37.936 --> 59:40.063
Pretty lady, 100 bahts.

59:40.314 --> 59:42.107
- No, no.
- 80 bahts.

59:42.357 --> 59:43.442
50 bahts.

59:43.692 --> 59:47.738
Pretty lady, real elephant. 60 bahts.

59:47.988 --> 59:51.617
Missy, yesa!

01:00:01.543 --> 01:00:05.631
Elephant. Bargain, mister. 100 bahts.

01:00:10.844 --> 01:00:13.430
Elephant! Real elephant.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.601
50 bahts.

01:00:19.354 --> 01:00:22.607
You are very handsome man. 40 bahts.

01:00:22.857 --> 01:00:24.943
For you, mister, 20 bahts.

01:00:25.193 --> 01:00:31.032
Sonny, I'll give you 20,000 bahts
if you can make this heap go any faster.

01:00:31.282 --> 01:00:34.577
20,000 bahts!

01:00:36.037 --> 01:00:42.585
- I'm afraid I'll have to owe you.
- Bloody tourist! 20,000 bahts!

01:00:58.268 --> 01:01:01.521
Goddamn little brown water hog!

01:01:01.771 --> 01:01:04.023
Oh, what's the matter, JW, huh?

01:01:04.232 --> 01:01:10.822
You just try that in "my" bayou, boy!
I'd haul your ass!

01:01:28.798 --> 01:01:33.971
Oh, look, JW. I just gotta have me
one of those cute little elephants.

01:01:34.221 --> 01:01:36.056
Elephants!

01:01:36.307 --> 01:01:39.894
We're Democrats, Maybelle.

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:46.775
If you got your little pointy heads
out of them pajamas,

01:01:46.984 --> 01:01:50.654
you wouldn't be late for work.

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:20.352
I knew it!

01:02:20.602 --> 01:02:28.485
You pointy-heads has no more idea
of traffic control than a gooney bird!

01:02:35.116 --> 01:02:40.830
Get your cotton-picking schnoz
out of my pants. Hear now?

01:02:59.892 --> 01:03:04.772
Boy, you is ugly.

01:03:07.024 --> 01:03:09.610
JW?

01:03:09.861 --> 01:03:13.239
Where are you?

01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:46.063
What do they teach in that school?
Ballet dancing?

01:03:47.315 --> 01:03:51.652
I find nothing remotely amusing
about Mr Bond's escape.

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.404
You underestimated him.

01:03:53.654 --> 01:03:57.659
Even my influence doesn't extend
into the British Secret Service.

01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:59.661
I shall lie low too.

01:03:59.912 --> 01:04:03.624
I won't jeopardise a project
in which I've invested half my fortune,

01:04:03.874 --> 01:04:05.792
when it's ready to yield billions.

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:10.047
- Where will you hide out?
- That does not concern you.

01:04:10.255 --> 01:04:12.758
Take this.

01:04:13.008 --> 01:04:17.930
Return it to the plant and
don't leave there without my permission.

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.307
May I remind you that you work for me.

01:04:20.516 --> 01:04:25.145
I took you on as a junior partner to be an
occasional convenience. Nothing more.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:28.899
I did not hire you to interfere in my affairs.

01:04:29.191 --> 01:04:34.321
- Is that clearly understood?
- Oh, yes, very clearly.

01:04:34.988 --> 01:04:39.034
I now regret having even considered
employing your services,

01:04:39.326 --> 01:04:41.328
but that is beside the point.

01:04:41.578 --> 01:04:46.083
Bond doesn't know you're in Bangkok.
He's never seen you, but he knows me.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.461
That's the problem.

01:04:48.711 --> 01:04:52.298
That's no problem.

01:05:10.483 --> 01:05:13.612
What happened?

01:05:13.904 --> 01:05:16.198
Mr Fat has just resigned.

01:05:16.407 --> 01:05:20.244
I'm the new chairman of the board.

01:05:20.452 --> 01:05:22.872
He always did like that mausoleum.

01:05:23.163 --> 01:05:26.709
Put him in it.

01:05:43.434 --> 01:05:45.811
Sorry about that, darling. It was Hip.

01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:50.691
Still no sign of Hai Fat. Every inquiry
gets a polite Oriental brushoff.

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:53.485
With the compliments.

01:05:53.736 --> 01:05:56.155
"Phuyuck"?

01:05:56.405 --> 01:06:00.034
'74, sir.

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:07.082
- I approve.
- You do?

01:06:07.291 --> 01:06:10.753
Oh, not the wine. Your frock.

01:06:11.045 --> 01:06:14.507
Tight in all the right places.
Not too many buttons.

01:06:14.757 --> 01:06:17.468
Standard uniform for Southeast Asia.

01:06:17.718 --> 01:06:20.429
The buttons are down the back.

01:06:20.679 --> 01:06:24.684
Designed by Q, no doubt.
One of them's a suicide pill, I suppose.

01:06:24.935 --> 01:06:29.147
No. But the bottom one has a homer in it.

01:06:29.397 --> 01:06:31.358
How original.

01:06:31.566 --> 01:06:37.948
"A toast.
Per ora e per il momento che verrá."

01:06:38.198 --> 01:06:40.534
"To this moment,

01:06:40.742 --> 01:06:44.371
and the moment yet to come."

01:06:48.124 --> 01:06:52.963
In our profession, I'm afraid, you never
can count on that moment to come.

01:06:53.213 --> 01:06:57.175
Who knows where you and I will be
this time next year?

01:06:57.425 --> 01:07:00.595
Opposite sides of the world, most likely.

01:07:00.887 --> 01:07:03.348
That's too far apart.

01:07:03.598 --> 01:07:06.852
Now, if Hip doesn't come up with a lead,

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:11.731
there's really nothing very much
for us to do tonight.

01:07:14.317 --> 01:07:17.404
Or is there?

01:07:17.654 --> 01:07:20.949
Oh, darling, I'm tempted.

01:07:21.199 --> 01:07:24.536
But killing a few hours
as one of your passing fancies

01:07:24.786 --> 01:07:28.456
isn't quite my scene.

01:08:05.913 --> 01:08:09.499
Phuyuck!

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:23.721
Ah! Goodnight. What a pleasant surprise.

01:08:23.971 --> 01:08:27.809
My hard-to-get act
didn't last very long, did it?

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:32.022
I was trained
to expect the unexpected, but...

01:08:32.272 --> 01:08:37.653
they never prepared me
for anything like you in a nightie.

01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:56.839
James, I thought
this would never happen.

01:09:02.595 --> 01:09:07.308
- What made you change your mind?
- I'm weak.

01:09:08.434 --> 01:09:12.104
Don't move!

01:09:27.203 --> 01:09:31.916
Miss Anders! I didn't recognise you
with your clothes on.

01:09:32.166 --> 01:09:34.460
I bribed a bellboy to let me in.

01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:36.587
I've come to warn you,

01:09:36.837 --> 01:09:38.756
you're in great danger.

01:09:39.006 --> 01:09:44.261
I usually am. That's why I use
the old three-pillow trick.

01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:47.890
Please believe me.
I'm risking my life to come here.

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.477
Well, your concern for my wellbeing
is touching,

01:09:51.728 --> 01:09:53.813
but puzzles me.

01:09:54.063 --> 01:09:57.775
- Scaramanga is in Bangkok.
- He was in Hong Kong, but not after me.

01:09:58.026 --> 01:10:01.738
We've been through that routine.

01:10:02.906 --> 01:10:05.241
He's a monster. I hate him.

01:10:05.491 --> 01:10:07.828
Then leave him.

01:10:08.078 --> 01:10:11.165
You don't walk out on Scaramanga.

01:10:11.415 --> 01:10:16.754
- There's no place he wouldn't find me.
- You need a good lawyer.

01:10:16.795 --> 01:10:18.881
I need 007.

01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:23.677
Who do you think sent that bullet
to London with your number on it?

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:27.556
I did.

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:33.854
And it wasn't easy
getting his fingerprint on the note.

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.942
Forgive me
if I've been slow on the uptake.

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:42.322
Don't you see you're the only man
in the world who can kill him?

01:10:42.531 --> 01:10:45.283
Now, what gives you that idea?

01:10:45.534 --> 01:10:48.453
The way Scaramanga speaks about you.

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:53.458
- Even has a likeness of you.
- I'm flattered.

01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:58.588
I want him dead.

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:03.552
Name your price. Anything, I'll pay it.

01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:09.432
You can have me too, if you like.

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:11.685
I'm not unattractive.

01:11:11.935 --> 01:11:16.731
At last you're starting to tell the truth.

01:11:19.484 --> 01:11:23.573
I've dreamed about you setting me free.

01:11:27.702 --> 01:11:34.000
I've been dreaming about a solex agitator.

01:11:38.087 --> 01:11:41.674
Ever heard of one?

01:11:44.051 --> 01:11:47.638
Perhaps you can have that too.

01:12:01.694 --> 01:12:05.865
- No, my clothes are in there.
- Get in.

01:12:06.073 --> 01:12:09.744
- I'll kill that woman.
- Later!

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:30.848
Charming.

01:12:47.199 --> 01:12:51.828
It was an inspiration, sending that bullet.

01:13:32.452 --> 01:13:34.621
You're late.

01:13:34.913 --> 01:13:38.501
It was a double feature.

01:13:40.044 --> 01:13:42.463
What are you doing?

01:13:42.672 --> 01:13:46.509
Putting my jewellery away.

01:14:01.108 --> 01:14:03.027
You can come out now.

01:14:03.319 --> 01:14:05.946
- What time is it?
- Two-ish.

01:14:06.197 --> 01:14:09.658
Two? You mean
I've been in here for two hours?

01:14:09.909 --> 01:14:12.119
All in the line of duty.

01:14:12.369 --> 01:14:15.164
Duty! I'm resigning in the morning!

01:14:15.414 --> 01:14:18.834
Goodnight, don't let us down.
The Service needs women like you.

01:14:19.084 --> 01:14:22.922
Well, obviously you don't!

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:25.549
Forgive me, darling.

01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:27.968
Your turn will come, I promise.

01:14:28.219 --> 01:14:30.262
As soon as she brings me that solex.

01:14:30.471 --> 01:14:35.518
- For killing Scaramanga?
- If she gets me the solex agitator first.

01:14:35.768 --> 01:14:37.645
First?

01:14:37.937 --> 01:14:42.191
James, you must be good.

01:14:43.317 --> 01:14:49.323
Oh. We'll find out about that
the next time I meet her.

01:14:49.907 --> 01:14:53.577
She's making the arrangements.

01:15:32.701 --> 01:15:36.246
Sorry I'm late.
Bangkok traffic's worse than Piccadilly.

01:15:36.454 --> 01:15:38.707
He's made contact.

01:15:38.999 --> 01:15:42.544
- How's the charm boy doing?
- Need you ask?

01:15:42.794 --> 01:15:46.047
Meet you outside.

01:15:48.216 --> 01:15:51.803
Did you bring it?

01:16:19.165 --> 01:16:21.250
Darling, I left it in your handbag.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:25.338
It must be in here somewhere, dear.
I saw the man in the shop give it to you.

01:16:25.588 --> 01:16:28.257
Without the ticket, we can't get a receipt.

01:16:28.466 --> 01:16:31.678
You won't find it in there, Mr Bond.
I looked before you came.

01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:36.308
I wouldn't do that either. Look behind you.

01:16:36.475 --> 01:16:39.686
Lower.

01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:46.151
A gun in a bag of peanuts. How original.
What will they think of next?

01:16:47.653 --> 01:16:51.031
My name is Scaramanga.
Francisco Scaramanga.

01:16:51.323 --> 01:16:55.244
I feel I know you, although
I never thought we should ever meet.

01:16:55.536 --> 01:16:59.665
It's a very great pleasure for me, Mr Bond,
thanks to Miss Anders.

01:16:59.873 --> 01:17:02.376
You've a strange way
of showing gratitude.

01:17:02.668 --> 01:17:06.004
A mistress cannot serve two masters.

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:09.299
A difficult shot, but most gratifying.

01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:13.053
Well, we, er... all get our jollies
one way or another.

01:17:13.303 --> 01:17:16.014
Mine have always been guns, Mr Bond.

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:19.309
When I was a boy
I was brought up in a circus.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:24.481
My only real friend
was a magnificent African bull elephant.

01:17:24.731 --> 01:17:29.779
One day his handler mistreated him
and he went berserk.

01:17:30.154 --> 01:17:33.324
Bleeding, dying,

01:17:33.575 --> 01:17:37.245
he came and found me.

01:17:37.328 --> 01:17:44.419
Stood on one leg - his best trick -
picked me up and put me on his back.

01:17:46.296 --> 01:17:50.133
The man emptied the gun into his eye.

01:17:50.675 --> 01:17:57.348
- I emptied my stage pistol into his.
- An eye for an eye. Nut?

01:18:01.227 --> 01:18:04.439
You see, Mr Bond,
I always thought I liked animals.

01:18:04.731 --> 01:18:09.652
Then I discovered that
I liked killing people even more.

01:18:15.909 --> 01:18:19.287
Keep this. Whatever you do, don't lose it.

01:18:19.329 --> 01:18:22.665
- I have to help James.
- Something's wrong?

01:18:22.916 --> 01:18:25.752
- There's a midget with a gun on him.
- A midget?

01:18:26.044 --> 01:18:31.132
Same one I saw at the Bottoms Up.
The girl is dead. Call the police!

01:18:37.305 --> 01:18:39.516
Forget the girl. She's replaceable.

01:18:39.766 --> 01:18:42.018
And I shall find what she stole from me.

01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:46.815
Personally, I have nothing against you,
so let's hope our paths never cross again.

01:18:47.066 --> 01:18:48.984
Please don't try to follow me.

01:18:49.235 --> 01:18:52.196
Your peanut-toting friend back there
wouldn't like it.

01:18:52.446 --> 01:18:56.075
No, he wouldn't.

01:19:05.918 --> 01:19:09.547
You want to try one of mine?

01:19:18.472 --> 01:19:20.599
- Where's the solex?
- With Goodnight.

01:19:20.850 --> 01:19:24.186
- Where's Goodnight?
- Outside.

01:19:58.014 --> 01:20:01.642
She must be by the car.

01:20:28.711 --> 01:20:32.340
Women! Walkie-talkie.

01:20:34.967 --> 01:20:38.429
- Goodnight, where are you?
- Somebody locked me in a boot.

01:20:38.679 --> 01:20:43.851
"- In a what?!
- The midget's car. I'm locked in."

01:20:44.101 --> 01:20:50.316
"It's a bronze car with a black roof.
Number 7543."

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.447
- The keys!
- I haven't got them.

01:20:56.656 --> 01:20:58.824
Oh, no.

01:20:59.075 --> 01:21:02.662
"- Goodnight, where are the car keys?
- Oh, I've got the keys."

01:21:02.954 --> 01:21:07.083
And I've got the solex too.

01:21:07.917 --> 01:21:09.210
Taxi!

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:14.174
Stay in there, Goodnight.
We've got you spotted.

01:21:20.847 --> 01:21:24.476
Taxi! Taxi!

01:21:25.018 --> 01:21:28.438
Taxi!

01:21:37.322 --> 01:21:42.244
- How 'bout a demonstration, boy?
- Certainly, sir.

01:21:49.001 --> 01:21:53.463
What the hell is goin' on?!

01:21:57.551 --> 01:22:01.013
Now... I know you!

01:22:01.263 --> 01:22:02.556
Oh, no.

01:22:02.764 --> 01:22:08.812
You're that secret agent.
That English secret agent from England.

01:22:18.363 --> 01:22:20.699
You're chasin' somebody.

01:22:20.908 --> 01:22:23.578
Who are you after this time, boy?
Commies?

01:22:23.828 --> 01:22:28.250
Let's go get 'em! I'm with you all the way.

01:22:34.715 --> 01:22:38.886
Uh-oh. I think we've got trouble.

01:22:56.070 --> 01:23:00.115
Pull your cars over,
you little brown pointy-heads!

01:23:00.366 --> 01:23:03.285
I'm a peace officer!

01:23:03.536 --> 01:23:06.038
"James? Are you still there?"

01:23:06.288 --> 01:23:07.998
"James!"

01:23:08.290 --> 01:23:10.459
Can you hear me? James!

01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:12.628
All right, Goodnight. Don't panic.

01:23:12.836 --> 01:23:15.881
- Who's that?
- It's, er...

01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:18.551
- It's Headquarters.
- Let me talk to 'em.

01:23:18.801 --> 01:23:20.928
Hello. This is Sheriff JW Pepper,

01:23:21.136 --> 01:23:22.680
"Louisiana State Police."

01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:28.310
"You call my wife at the Narai Hotel
and tell her I'm on a mission."

01:23:28.602 --> 01:23:31.063
I've been deputised. Right?

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:32.815
Right.

01:23:33.065 --> 01:23:36.694
Which car are we all chasin', boy?

01:24:46.556 --> 01:24:49.351
Move it! Move it!

01:24:49.559 --> 01:24:53.356
Get that piece of junk off of the road.

01:25:20.551 --> 01:25:23.887
They went left, boy.

01:25:31.311 --> 01:25:35.190
Press that pedal, boy.

01:25:48.579 --> 01:25:52.249
Where the hell have they got to?

01:26:04.887 --> 01:26:08.224
You goofed, boy.

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:23.323
Nearest bridge is two miles back.

01:26:30.455 --> 01:26:33.416
Goddamn! What the...

01:26:33.666 --> 01:26:38.880
What's goin' on?
What the hell are you doin' now, boy?

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.051
The bridge is "that" way!

01:26:45.637 --> 01:26:47.347
You're not thinking of...?

01:26:47.597 --> 01:26:50.767
I sure am, boy!

01:26:51.017 --> 01:26:54.854
Ever heard of Evel Knievel?

01:27:03.029 --> 01:27:07.492
Wowee!

01:27:08.243 --> 01:27:10.453
I ain't never done that before!

01:27:10.662 --> 01:27:14.541
Neither have I, actually.

01:28:09.263 --> 01:28:13.517
Let's go get 'em, boy!

01:28:48.095 --> 01:28:50.014
You stay put, boy.

01:28:50.264 --> 01:28:53.684
This is "my" department.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.021
Glad to see you boys on the ball!

01:28:57.271 --> 01:29:00.441
Sheriff JW Pepper, Louisiana State Police.

01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.485
Here's my identification.

01:29:02.693 --> 01:29:05.571
Law Enforcement Association,
American Legion.

01:29:05.738 --> 01:29:08.950
Me and my partner here,
we're on a secret mission.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.663
What the hell you doing?
Give me my wallet back.

01:29:32.557 --> 01:29:35.977
Doors.

01:30:04.798 --> 01:30:07.759
You can't do this to me.
I want my wallet back.

01:30:08.010 --> 01:30:10.053
Take these goddamn bracelets off!

01:30:10.304 --> 01:30:14.433
I'm gonna sue ya for false arrest!
Police brutality. I got connections.

01:30:14.641 --> 01:30:17.936
I'm gonna get the FBI on your ass!
The CIA!

01:30:18.186 --> 01:30:21.690
Goddamn it,
I'm gonna get Henry Kissinger!

01:30:21.940 --> 01:30:26.820
Now look at me
when I'm talkin' to ya, boy.

01:30:31.325 --> 01:30:36.496
What's the matter?
Ain't none of you seen a plane before?

01:30:38.207 --> 01:30:41.710
"James? James, are you still there?"

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.879
"Can you hear me?"

01:30:44.087 --> 01:30:47.758
"I think we've stopped."

01:31:06.611 --> 01:31:10.616
That is really
all there is to report, sir.

01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:13.786
So, if I heard correctly,
Scaramanga got away.

01:31:14.078 --> 01:31:15.371
Yes, sir.

01:31:15.579 --> 01:31:19.291
- In a car that sprouted wings.
- That's perfectly feasible, sir.

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:23.212
- In fact, we're working on one now.
- Oh, Q! Shut up.

01:31:23.462 --> 01:31:25.798
- Miss Goodnight was in the boot?
- Yes, sir.

01:31:26.048 --> 01:31:29.927
We found the car-plane abandoned
about 200 miles west of Bangkok.

01:31:30.219 --> 01:31:33.472
- And the solex?
- In Goodnight's handbag, sir.

01:31:33.722 --> 01:31:36.141
- Where's Goodnight now?
- We don't know, sir.

01:31:36.433 --> 01:31:40.563
Communications aren't getting the signal
from the homer she has supplied by Q.

01:31:40.813 --> 01:31:44.817
Rubbish! They're simply
not stepping up the reception to enable...

01:31:45.067 --> 01:31:46.986
Oh, shut up, Q!

01:31:47.194 --> 01:31:51.115
Of all the fouled-up,
half-witted operations!

01:31:51.323 --> 01:31:54.702
- What do you want?
- We've picked up Goodnight's signal, sir.

01:31:54.952 --> 01:32:00.416
- Well, that's something.
- But there's something rather curious, sir.

01:32:00.666 --> 01:32:02.376
Our sector's here,

01:32:02.585 --> 01:32:07.423
and we're receiving her signal
from somewhere off this coastline here.

01:32:07.631 --> 01:32:10.843
Now here it is on a much larger scale.

01:32:11.093 --> 01:32:14.430
That's where she is.
In this group of small islands.

01:32:14.638 --> 01:32:17.309
That's all we need! Red Chinese waters.

01:32:17.559 --> 01:32:20.562
We could stray
inadvertently into them, sir.

01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:25.275
- I could fly low under their radar screen.
- Absolutely out of the question.

01:32:25.525 --> 01:32:29.613
If the PM gets to hear of this,
he'll hang me from the yardarm.

01:32:29.863 --> 01:32:35.285
Officially you won't know
a thing about it, sir.

01:33:50.945 --> 01:33:53.865
There's a small seaplane
approaching your island.

01:33:54.115 --> 01:33:56.033
Do you want us to take action?

01:33:56.284 --> 01:34:00.955
No. No, please don't do anything.

01:34:01.497 --> 01:34:03.040
Yes, it's a...

01:34:03.291 --> 01:34:06.920
guest I'm expecting.

01:34:07.588 --> 01:34:10.799
No, he won't be leaving.

01:35:28.795 --> 01:35:31.214
"Bonjour, Monsieur Bond."

01:35:31.506 --> 01:35:34.467
I am Nick Nack.

01:35:36.719 --> 01:35:38.805
"Dom Pérignon soixante-quatre."

01:35:39.013 --> 01:35:41.224
I prefer the '62 myself.

01:35:41.474 --> 01:35:43.393
Still, beats a bag of peanuts.

01:35:43.685 --> 01:35:48.856
Monsieur Scaramanga
will welcome you personally.

01:35:52.151 --> 01:35:57.074
Forgive me, Mr Bond.
A vulgar display, but I couldn't resist it

01:35:57.283 --> 01:36:00.661
because I am so delighted
to see you again.

01:36:00.911 --> 01:36:03.831
A harmless toy.

01:36:04.123 --> 01:36:07.835
I am, as you can see now,
completely unarmed.

01:36:08.127 --> 01:36:09.795
Cigarette?

01:36:10.045 --> 01:36:12.840
We have so much in common
and so much to discuss.

01:36:13.090 --> 01:36:15.259
We will never have this chance again.

01:36:15.509 --> 01:36:20.389
Ours is the loneliest profession, so let us
spend a few pleasant hours together.

01:36:20.639 --> 01:36:23.225
How can I refuse
such a gracious invitation?

01:36:23.517 --> 01:36:25.686
Splendid. Splendid!

01:36:25.895 --> 01:36:30.399
Nick Nack, I expect you to surpass
yourself. He's a cordon bleu, you know?

01:36:30.691 --> 01:36:34.570
By the way, where's Miss Goodnight?

01:36:34.862 --> 01:36:36.947
Oh, she's around here somewhere.

01:36:37.198 --> 01:36:39.950
She can't leave,
so she does as she pleases.

01:36:40.201 --> 01:36:42.203
How do you like my island?

01:36:42.453 --> 01:36:44.163
A bit off the beaten track.

01:36:44.413 --> 01:36:47.708
It's rent-free.
I do my landlords an occasional favour.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.085
A cosy arrangement.

01:36:50.294 --> 01:36:53.130
- Servant problem, I suppose?
- Not at all.

01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:57.134
Nick Nack does for me very nicely.

01:36:58.093 --> 01:37:01.389
Usually there's just us two,
but guests are no inconvenience.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:06.603
We're entirely self-supporting. We have
every electrical device you can think of.

01:37:06.853 --> 01:37:11.734
This is an airlock,
as you are doubtless aware.

01:37:12.276 --> 01:37:15.863
Automatic, of course.

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:21.077
Naturally, we have an ample supply
of electricity here.

01:37:21.327 --> 01:37:24.956
Let me show you.

01:37:39.011 --> 01:37:41.514
This should run
a few electric toothbrushes.

01:37:41.806 --> 01:37:45.434
Up here.

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:52.400
A solar-energy station.
So this is what it's all about. Ah!

01:37:52.650 --> 01:37:57.488
Thermoelectric generators
to convert solar energy into electricity.

01:37:57.738 --> 01:38:00.575
All built by Hai Fat's
construction company, no doubt.

01:38:00.825 --> 01:38:05.413
Somehow I seem to have inherited it
from him. It's all fully automated.

01:38:05.663 --> 01:38:10.668
Kra looks after maintenance and security
in here. Nick Nack does everything else.

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:14.755
They tell me the electricity
is stored in here... somewhere.

01:38:15.006 --> 01:38:18.384
Science was never my strong point.

01:38:18.634 --> 01:38:23.389
Superconductivity coils
cooled by liquid helium.

01:38:23.639 --> 01:38:28.937
If I were you, I wouldn't stick my finger -
or anything else, for that matter - in there.

01:38:29.187 --> 01:38:33.984
At 453% below zero, that liquid helium
would break it off like an icicle.

01:38:34.234 --> 01:38:36.862
You really know
far more about it than I do.

01:38:37.112 --> 01:38:41.783
I'm arranging for countries that can afford
the price to send experts here to see this.

01:38:42.034 --> 01:38:45.245
But no solex
until the money is in the bank, right?

01:38:45.495 --> 01:38:46.830
Right.

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:51.376
- I have run across similar situations.
- Not what I've got here.

01:38:51.627 --> 01:38:55.088
This way the highest bidder
can build hundreds of stations

01:38:55.297 --> 01:38:58.634
and sell franchises for hundreds more.

01:38:58.884 --> 01:39:02.054
He will literally have the sun in his pocket.

01:39:02.304 --> 01:39:05.265
A monopoly on solar power.

01:39:05.474 --> 01:39:09.186
The oil sheikhs will pay you
just to keep solar energy "off" the market.

01:39:09.436 --> 01:39:13.482
The thought had occurred to me.

01:39:16.485 --> 01:39:20.280
This is the collection point.

01:39:32.334 --> 01:39:35.379
Ah! So that's where it belongs.

01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:42.554
Our famous solex in the still down there
transmits heat to the thermal generators.

01:39:43.304 --> 01:39:46.933
It's collected through this?

01:39:49.310 --> 01:39:53.982
But where is it collected from?
You need the sun.

01:40:02.241 --> 01:40:06.036
Watch that mushroom-shaped rock.

01:40:26.932 --> 01:40:28.267
Ingenious, isn't it?

01:40:28.517 --> 01:40:31.729
The panels lock on to the sun,
then track it automatically.

01:40:31.979 --> 01:40:35.274
Something like that, yes.

01:40:41.363 --> 01:40:47.119
Ah. Reflected through this, those panels
must produce a heat of at least 3,500%F.

01:40:47.369 --> 01:40:51.415
If you say so, Mr Bond.

01:40:53.043 --> 01:40:59.216
But I do know we can focus the power
wherever we want. Here, I'll show you.

01:41:00.133 --> 01:41:03.929
This is a bonus.

01:41:04.429 --> 01:41:08.350
Goes with the solex. No extra charge.

01:41:28.453 --> 01:41:32.165
This is the part I really like.

01:41:40.507 --> 01:41:44.511
Now that's what I call solar power.

01:41:44.803 --> 01:41:48.431
That's what I call trouble.

01:41:48.723 --> 01:41:54.646
You must admit I am now undeniably
the Man with the Golden Gun.

01:41:59.192 --> 01:42:02.862
Lunch.

01:42:17.795 --> 01:42:20.965
This way, Mr Bond.

01:42:21.215 --> 01:42:23.426
Ah, Miss Goodnight!

01:42:23.634 --> 01:42:26.679
- James!
- Aren't we a little overdressed?

01:42:26.971 --> 01:42:30.099
I like a girl in a bikini.
No concealed weapons.

01:42:30.349 --> 01:42:34.604
Miss Goodnight, please. Mr Bond.

01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:37.440
Let's see what Nick Nack has for us.

01:42:37.690 --> 01:42:41.319
Ah, mushrooms.

01:42:43.279 --> 01:42:46.157
The fried mushroom
looks terribly interesting.

01:42:46.449 --> 01:42:51.537
Yes, I'd noticed that.
I'll get around to it later.

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.877
- Having fun in the sun, Goodnight?
- Yes!

01:42:57.085 --> 01:43:00.756
I could stay here for ever.

01:43:01.632 --> 01:43:03.884
Mm, excellent.

01:43:04.134 --> 01:43:10.474
- Slightly reminiscent of a '34 Mouton.
- Then I must add it to my cellar.

01:43:11.183 --> 01:43:14.019
You live well, Scaramanga.

01:43:14.269 --> 01:43:18.190
At a million dollars a contract,
I can afford to, Mr Bond.

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:23.738
You work for peanuts. A "well done" from
the Queen and a pittance of a pension.

01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:27.283
Apart from that, we are the same.

01:43:27.534 --> 01:43:32.664
To us, Mr Bond. We are the best.

01:43:32.997 --> 01:43:38.461
There's a useful four-letter word,
and you're full of it.

01:43:39.587 --> 01:43:42.840
When I kill it's under specific orders
of my government.

01:43:43.091 --> 01:43:45.843
And those I kill are themselves killers.

01:43:46.052 --> 01:43:48.596
Come, come, Mr Bond.
You disappoint me.

01:43:48.846 --> 01:43:51.975
You get as much fulfilment
out of killing as I do. Admit it.

01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:56.688
- I admit killing you would be a pleasure.
- You should have done that before.

01:43:56.938 --> 01:44:01.025
But then the English don't think
it's sporting to kill in cold blood.

01:44:01.234 --> 01:44:04.696
Don't count on that.

01:44:14.497 --> 01:44:20.128
I could have shot you when you landed,
but that would have been too easy.

01:44:23.006 --> 01:44:24.883
You see, Mr Bond,

01:44:25.174 --> 01:44:29.596
like every great artist, I want to create
an indisputable masterpiece

01:44:29.846 --> 01:44:32.390
once in my lifetime.

01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:36.437
The death of 007, "mano a mano",

01:44:36.687 --> 01:44:38.397
face to face,

01:44:38.647 --> 01:44:40.774
will be mine.

01:44:40.983 --> 01:44:45.070
You mean stuffed and displayed
over your rocky mantelpiece.

01:44:45.362 --> 01:44:49.199
That's an amusing idea,
but I was thinking in terms of history.

01:44:49.491 --> 01:44:52.119
A duel between titans.

01:44:52.369 --> 01:44:55.581
My golden gun against your Walther PPK.

01:44:55.831 --> 01:44:58.250
Each of us with a 50-50 chance.

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.920
Six bullets to your one?

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:04.548
I only need one.

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:07.927
Sounds a bit old-fashioned, doesn't it?

01:45:08.177 --> 01:45:10.888
I mean, pistols at dawn, that sort of thing.

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:13.349
Indeed it is, Mr Bond.

01:45:13.599 --> 01:45:17.603
But it still remains
the only "true" test for gentlemen.

01:45:17.853 --> 01:45:21.565
I doubt if you qualify on that score.

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.945
However, I accept.

01:45:26.237 --> 01:45:31.617
As soon as I have finished this delicious
lunch that Nick Nack has prepared for us.

01:45:31.867 --> 01:45:37.206
"Messieurs", I will remind you,
this is "un duel á la mort".

01:45:37.498 --> 01:45:41.085
Only one of you
can leave the field of honour.

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:44.630
If a "coup de grâce" is necessary,

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:49.595
as your referee, I will administer it myself.

01:45:49.845 --> 01:45:54.850
"I do not expect wounds, only a clean kill."

01:45:55.059 --> 01:46:00.940
"On my command
each contestant will take 20 paces."

01:46:01.148 --> 01:46:04.902
Are you ready, Monsieur Scaramanga?

01:46:06.571 --> 01:46:09.657
- Ready.
- Are you ready, Monsieur Bond?

01:46:09.949 --> 01:46:14.453
- Ready.
- I will now begin the count.

01:46:14.704 --> 01:46:16.664
One, two,

01:46:16.914 --> 01:46:20.126
three, four, five,

01:46:20.376 --> 01:46:24.755
six, seven, eight, nine,

01:46:25.006 --> 01:46:28.342
ten, eleven, twelve,

01:46:28.551 --> 01:46:30.595
"thirteen, fourteen,"

01:46:30.845 --> 01:46:32.889
fifteen, sixteen,

01:46:33.139 --> 01:46:34.765
"seventeen, eighteen,"

01:46:35.016 --> 01:46:38.853
nineteen, twenty!

01:47:20.562 --> 01:47:22.689
If you kill him,

01:47:22.940 --> 01:47:26.360
all this be mine.

01:47:27.611 --> 01:47:31.240
This way, Monsieur Bond.

01:48:07.651 --> 01:48:12.656
- Monsieur, good shooting.
- I've never killed a midget before.

01:48:12.906 --> 01:48:15.159
But there can always be a first time.

01:48:15.368 --> 01:48:18.997
Oh, monsieur!

01:49:32.822 --> 01:49:37.327
"You only have three bullets left."

01:49:50.549 --> 01:49:54.177
"I have fooled you."

01:53:13.923 --> 01:53:16.050
- Goodnight!
- James!

01:53:16.258 --> 01:53:18.260
Oh, James!

01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:20.429
Steady, Goodnight.

01:53:20.721 --> 01:53:22.598
Where is he?

01:53:22.890 --> 01:53:25.059
Flat on his "coup de grâce".

01:53:25.309 --> 01:53:30.689
Come on, let's get out of this fun palace
and find that solex.

01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:41.158
Wait here.
I'll take care of the maintenance man.

01:53:41.408 --> 01:53:43.327
I already did.

01:53:43.577 --> 01:53:45.287
I laid him out cold.

01:53:45.537 --> 01:53:47.456
- You did?
- Yes.

01:53:47.665 --> 01:53:51.835
There's more to you than meets the eye.

01:54:00.219 --> 01:54:04.223
I hate to ask stupid questions, but
where exactly did you knock him cold?

01:54:04.515 --> 01:54:07.142
He landed in that one.

01:54:07.393 --> 01:54:09.645
Don't you believe in signs?

01:54:09.895 --> 01:54:14.692
We've got five minutes before his body
temperature raises the helium above zero.

01:54:14.942 --> 01:54:17.403
Then this whole damn place
will go sky-high.

01:54:17.695 --> 01:54:21.282
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

01:55:41.448 --> 01:55:44.660
Kill the beam!

01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:48.121
- Hit the master override switch!
- The what?

01:55:48.413 --> 01:55:50.666
- Goodnight?
- Yes, James?

01:55:50.916 --> 01:55:54.836
Now listen carefully.
There's a console up there.

01:55:55.087 --> 01:56:00.968
Now, there must be a scanner
interlock button on it. Push it!

01:56:01.218 --> 01:56:03.262
Are you still there?

01:56:03.554 --> 01:56:08.392
It'll be on the auxiliary feedback circuit.

01:56:08.433 --> 01:56:11.728
"Computer interlock..." Is that it?

01:56:11.979 --> 01:56:15.899
Just push every damn button, will you?

01:56:33.292 --> 01:56:35.502
Good girl, Goodnight. You've done it.

01:56:35.752 --> 01:56:39.631
Oh, I have.

01:57:21.174 --> 01:57:25.929
Goodnight, get the hell out of there!
I've done it.

01:57:58.254 --> 01:58:02.174
- I hope you can swim, Goodnight.
- This way.

01:58:02.424 --> 01:58:06.638
His junk is moored around the corner.

01:59:08.575 --> 01:59:11.369
- But, darling, who is at the wheel?
- George.

01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:13.538
George?

01:59:13.788 --> 01:59:16.333
Automatic pilot.

01:59:16.583 --> 01:59:22.757
We should make Hong Kong
in about... eight hours.

01:59:22.965 --> 01:59:26.594
Give or... take a little.

01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:48.824
I always wanted to take
a slow boat "from" China.

02:00:33.871 --> 02:00:36.040
I'll kill you.

02:00:36.291 --> 02:00:38.626
I'll kill you!

02:00:38.876 --> 02:00:42.463
Why, you...!

02:01:30.094 --> 02:01:32.555
Hey! Let me out!

02:01:32.805 --> 02:01:35.433
Hey, what are you doing?

02:01:35.725 --> 02:01:37.477
Ouch!

02:01:37.769 --> 02:01:41.231
No, no, no! I can't breathe!

02:01:41.439 --> 02:01:43.900
Ow! You'll be sorry.

02:01:44.150 --> 02:01:47.863
I may be small, but I never forget.

02:01:50.616 --> 02:01:53.035
I kill you if you don't let me out of here!

02:01:53.285 --> 02:01:56.288
Ow! Let me out, you big bully!

02:01:56.538 --> 02:02:00.167
Shut up.

02:02:03.796 --> 02:02:07.466
- What did you do with him?
- What do you think?

02:02:07.716 --> 02:02:11.762
- Oh, James, you didn't!
- Yes, I damn well did.

02:02:11.971 --> 02:02:14.390
Got all the glass out of the bed, I trust?

02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:18.018
We don't want anything else
to disturb our peace,

02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:21.939
do we?

02:02:26.235 --> 02:02:29.572
Now, where were we?

02:02:29.822 --> 02:02:33.409
Oh, James!

02:02:34.326 --> 02:02:37.997
Mmm...

02:02:42.084 --> 02:02:45.671
What's the matter?

02:02:45.963 --> 02:02:49.550
Something came up.

02:02:51.385 --> 02:02:52.636
Hello?

02:02:52.928 --> 02:02:55.347
Ah, there you are, Bond.

02:02:55.598 --> 02:02:58.100
"Well done. Congratulations."

02:02:58.350 --> 02:02:59.643
Thank you, sir.

02:02:59.852 --> 02:03:02.981
"Is Miss Goodnight with you?
I'd like a word with her."

02:03:03.273 --> 02:03:06.860
Hold on, sir.

02:03:15.327 --> 02:03:19.122
"Bond? Bond, are you there?"

02:03:19.873 --> 02:03:22.542
"Goodnight?"

02:03:22.792 --> 02:03:26.380
She's just coming, sir.

02:03:31.636 --> 02:03:34.388
Goodnight?

02:03:34.931 --> 02:03:38.017
"Goodnight?"

02:03:38.267 --> 02:03:41.896
"- Goodnight!
- Good night, sir."

02:03:47.652 --> 02:03:51.322
"Good night, good night"

02:03:51.489 --> 02:03:55.576
"Sleep well, my dear"

02:03:55.785 --> 02:03:59.455
"No need to fear"

02:03:59.664 --> 02:04:07.797
"James Bond is here"

02:04:11.050 --> 02:04:15.264
"Oh, love is required
whenever he's hired"

02:04:15.556 --> 02:04:19.351
"It comes just before the kill"

02:04:19.643 --> 02:04:21.228
"No one can catch him"

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.313
"No hit man can match him"

02:04:23.605 --> 02:04:26.984
"For his million-dollar skill"

02:04:27.192 --> 02:04:31.488
"One golden shot
means another poor victim"

02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:35.993
"Has come to a glittering end"

02:04:36.243 --> 02:04:39.454
"If you want to get rid of someone"

02:04:39.705 --> 02:04:43.041
"The Man with the Golden Gun"

02:04:43.292 --> 02:04:46.545
"Will get it done"

02:04:46.795 --> 02:04:50.799
"He'll shoot anyone"

02:04:51.091 --> 02:04:57.681
"With his golden gun"
