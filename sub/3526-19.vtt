03:12.596 --> 03:14.598
What's that?

03:14.665 --> 03:17.267
I got a mysterious
package,

03:17.334 --> 03:19.269
Postmarked Las Vegas.

03:21.271 --> 03:23.607
Oh, "baume & mercier."

03:26.777 --> 03:28.445
Oh my God.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.781
This is so beautiful.

03:30.848 --> 03:32.783
I had it engraved.

03:33.784 --> 03:35.753
Here.

03:38.422 --> 03:40.491
"You are my life.
Love, t."

03:40.556 --> 03:42.420
They couldn't fit
"Tony."

03:42.491 --> 03:44.628
I believe that.

03:44.694 --> 03:46.631
Thank you.

03:47.869 --> 03:49.900
But I don't know
what it's for.

03:49.969 --> 03:51.803
Well, like I said,
I was sorry

03:51.865 --> 03:53.671
I had to go out
to Vegas when I did.

03:53.738 --> 03:55.670
Once you explained

03:55.736 --> 03:59.000
You had to take care of
Christopher's business interests...

04:00.446 --> 04:03.781
God knows
kelli'll need the money.

04:03.846 --> 04:05.910
The baby.

04:22.238 --> 04:24.001
I'm talking about
delay, right?

04:24.068 --> 04:26.033
Just take care
of that, all right?

04:26.108 --> 04:27.300
Bobby?

04:27.378 --> 04:29.332
John stefano.

04:29.407 --> 04:31.340
You touchin' asbestos?

04:31.406 --> 04:33.210
No, I don't work
with that shit.

04:33.278 --> 04:35.170
It's okay.

04:36.447 --> 04:38.381
Shame about
Chris Moltisanti.

04:41.118 --> 04:42.981
These bozos?

04:43.058 --> 04:45.920
Ecuadorians.
Bunch of 'em polacks.

04:45.988 --> 04:48.120
How come they ain't
wearing their space suits?

04:48.197 --> 04:49.961
That's a union rule.

04:50.025 --> 04:52.523
If I couldn't run this job
without that fucking contract,

04:52.598 --> 04:54.733
Ain't none of us gonna
make any real scratch.

04:56.808 --> 04:58.731
You don't got
an envelope?

05:00.807 --> 05:03.772
You must have seen
fights before.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.340
Your friends beating up
the African kid,

05:06.417 --> 05:09.313
Why do you think that's
been impossible to shake?

05:09.376 --> 05:12.481
They had my back after
all the shit with blanca.

05:12.545 --> 05:14.682
You know, they care
about me.

05:14.755 --> 05:17.682
Did you try to stop
the beating?

05:17.757 --> 05:20.393
I'm one individual.
What could I do?

05:27.595 --> 05:30.862
I know kids on lexapro
who say it's great,

05:30.935 --> 05:33.702
And I still feel
like shit.

05:33.776 --> 05:36.473
I mean, why can't I
catch a fuckin' break?

05:36.547 --> 05:39.400
Your classes,
how are you enjoying those?

05:39.476 --> 05:42.342
English is boring.

05:42.417 --> 05:44.840
And the other one's
kind of interesting,

05:44.916 --> 05:47.881
But it's pretty
depressing.

05:47.958 --> 05:50.252
The israeli-Palestinian
conflict?

05:50.328 --> 05:53.521
People blowing each other up
because their God says

05:53.598 --> 05:56.791
They're allowed to live in a
certainatch of fuckin' sand.

05:56.868 --> 06:00.091
Yeah, and other people's gods say
they're supposed to live there.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.331
Maybe I shouldn't
have taken it.

06:02.398 --> 06:05.062
You seem to be taking
it all personally.

06:05.136 --> 06:08.801
These mujahideen assholes,
like in indonesia,

06:08.875 --> 06:11.601
And they, like,
want to kill everybody.

06:11.676 --> 06:14.711
Have you considered writing
about your experience

06:14.776 --> 06:16.641
With the somali boy?

06:16.718 --> 06:18.813
A short story, perhaps?

06:18.888 --> 06:20.912
Why would I do that?

06:20.988 --> 06:23.183
It might help
clarify your feelings.

06:23.256 --> 06:26.521
I was watching cnn...

06:28.155 --> 06:32.662
and this story about these
kids in some iraqi hospital,

06:32.725 --> 06:35.762
How the burn unit doesn't have
the right medicine or something.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.762
And then they show
this story

06:38.836 --> 06:40.830
About some mall
in minnesota

06:40.906 --> 06:42.971
And these gigantic
fat people

06:43.048 --> 06:44.701
Buying stuff

06:44.776 --> 06:46.972
And eating all
this shit.

06:48.377 --> 06:50.481
You know, it's like
my parents.

06:50.548 --> 06:52.612
I mean, you should
see our house.

06:52.686 --> 06:55.583
I mean, the stupid
coffeemaker they got,

06:55.658 --> 06:57.253
The media room.

06:58.726 --> 07:00.293
Then there's blanca,

07:00.357 --> 07:02.551
Her kid hardly talks.

07:02.625 --> 07:06.290
She can't afford to send him
to a decent school.

07:06.367 --> 07:09.391
You think your feelings
about blanca

07:09.465 --> 07:12.801
In any way relate
to this African boy?

07:12.876 --> 07:15.273
She's not black.

07:17.077 --> 07:19.140
I mean,

07:19.207 --> 07:21.871
She's pretty tan.

07:27.856 --> 07:30.352
- Oh!
- There he is.

07:30.428 --> 07:32.683
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.751
Welcome back, Ton'.

07:34.825 --> 07:36.222
Good to see you again.

07:36.296 --> 07:37.722
<i>How was your trip?</i>

07:37.796 --> 07:40.130
Great.
Had a fuckin' blast.

07:40.195 --> 07:41.492
Yeah?

07:41.565 --> 07:46.101
Business too.
Christopher's shit.

07:46.175 --> 07:49.703
Some fucking guys
out there owed him money.

07:52.006 --> 07:54.811
Little Carmine took it on the
"cleaver" set. We had it framed.

07:57.616 --> 07:59.342
Talk about a trip--

07:59.418 --> 08:02.153
I met this girl,
she was fuckin' beautiful.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.550
Oh yeah?

08:04.628 --> 08:06.490
- Boys.
- Hey.

08:08.225 --> 08:10.590
- We did peyote.
- Come on.

08:10.668 --> 08:12.290
- Really?
- Bobby did mushrooms once.

08:12.368 --> 08:14.763
Stuffed mushrooms,
a whole fuckin' platter.

08:14.836 --> 08:16.501
Fuck you, huh?

08:18.235 --> 08:22.370
Anyway, that's--
That's some nutty shit,

08:22.438 --> 08:24.502
The desert...

08:25.876 --> 08:27.510
the light.

08:27.576 --> 08:30.542
I did "x" once. The
fucking was incredible.

08:32.316 --> 08:35.182
Oh, yeah yeah, you kiddin'?
Off the fuckin' charts.

08:35.258 --> 08:37.221
<i>- You wouldn't believe it.
- Really?</i>

08:37.284 --> 08:40.090
And the sun...

08:40.158 --> 08:42.150
came up...

08:45.126 --> 08:47.232
oh yeah?

08:47.296 --> 08:49.292
Well.

08:53.406 --> 08:55.070
We saw stefano.

08:55.137 --> 08:58.001
He didn't have
an envelope.

08:59.207 --> 09:00.741
Any movement on that?

09:00.817 --> 09:05.083
Eh, we should
probably see Phil.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.750
I got dosed with acid once, back in '68.

09:07.817 --> 09:10.121
I was with your dad
and them at the copa.

09:10.186 --> 09:13.223
Fuckin' b.O.A.C stewardess
put it in my drink.

09:13.297 --> 09:16.052
<i>Jerry vale started
singing and I look over,</i>

09:16.128 --> 09:18.961
Your uncle jun's got laser
beams shooting out of his eyes.

09:21.166 --> 09:24.002
I used to love
that house, but now...

09:24.068 --> 09:27.732
it's so big,
especially at night.

09:27.906 --> 09:30.170
You're afraid, you know,
all you got to do is call.

09:30.248 --> 09:31.603
Right?

09:31.675 --> 09:33.112
Two minutes,
I'll be over.

09:33.178 --> 09:35.140
I know.
Thank you.

09:35.216 --> 09:37.413
You've been so great.
Both of you.

09:37.486 --> 09:40.412
Well, Meadow had another
mystery date.

09:40.488 --> 09:42.352
That sounds exciting.

09:51.028 --> 09:53.790
What are you doing?
Sit.

09:53.865 --> 09:57.161
I made your favorite,
steak pizzaiol'.

09:57.238 --> 09:58.861
You know they spray
a virus on beef

09:58.938 --> 10:01.401
Rather than clean the ratshit
out of the slaughterhouses?

10:01.478 --> 10:03.900
- What is this now?
- Jesus Christ.

10:03.976 --> 10:07.373
It's true.
Read the paper.

10:07.447 --> 10:09.313
I do
read the paper.

10:09.377 --> 10:11.283
Never heard that.

10:11.346 --> 10:13.851
I'm not talking
about the sports page.

10:13.916 --> 10:17.783
I mean, the f.D.A.?
They approved a virus spray

10:17.856 --> 10:20.653
Because it kills a similar
bacteria found on meat.

10:20.728 --> 10:22.450
Must be
a good thing then.

10:22.525 --> 10:25.422
<i>Yeah.
For the meatpackers,</i>

10:25.495 --> 10:27.593
The fucking God
of the bottom line.

10:27.668 --> 10:29.463
All right,
that's enough.

10:29.537 --> 10:31.500
<i>We're trying to eat here,</i>

10:31.561 --> 10:35.338
And you're upsetting people
that have been through a tragedy.

10:35.404 --> 10:38.441
Fine. Bury your head
in the sand.

10:38.509 --> 10:40.770
How about I bury yours
in that fuckin' wall instead?

10:42.579 --> 10:44.981
- Tony.
- For 20 years, he won't crack a book,

10:45.046 --> 10:47.782
All of a sudden he's the
world's foremost authority.

10:55.128 --> 10:57.792
At least he's getting
an education.

10:57.867 --> 11:00.163
An education's to help you
get a better job.

11:00.238 --> 11:03.101
He's actually reading.
This can't be bad.

11:03.168 --> 11:05.563
"The blood-Dimmed tide
is loosed,

11:05.635 --> 11:08.071
And everywhere,
the ceremony of innocence

11:08.137 --> 11:09.803
Is drowned;

11:09.877 --> 11:12.643
<i>The best lack
all conviction,</i>

11:12.707 --> 11:17.341
<i>While the worst are full
of passionate intensity.</i>

11:17.416 --> 11:19.951
Surely some revelation

11:20.015 --> 11:21.951
Is at hand."

11:22.017 --> 11:24.320
<i>"...Somewhere in the sands
of the desert</i>

11:24.388 --> 11:26.392
<i>A shape with lion body</i>

11:26.457 --> 11:30.923
<i>And the head of a man, a gaze
blank and pitiless as the sun,</i>

11:30.995 --> 11:33.293
<i>Is moving its slow thighs,</i>

11:33.367 --> 11:36.701
<i>While all about it reel shadows
of the indignant desert birds.</i>

11:36.766 --> 11:39.103
<i>The darkness drops again;</i>

11:39.167 --> 11:43.640
<i>But now I know that
twenty centuries of stony sleep</i>

11:43.707 --> 11:46.610
<i>Were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle,</i>

11:46.675 --> 11:50.010
<i>And what rough beast,
its hour come round at last,</i>

11:50.087 --> 11:52.811
<i>Slouches towards bethlehem
to be born?"</i>

11:56.856 --> 11:58.482
Hey, Tony.

11:58.557 --> 12:01.421
You don't look
so good.

12:01.497 --> 12:03.891
This job.

12:03.966 --> 12:05.462
You want a sandwich?
A cannoli

12:05.526 --> 12:06.592
On the house?

12:06.667 --> 12:08.532
No, this microbe
of mine--

12:08.596 --> 12:11.160
From Pakistan.

12:11.238 --> 12:13.433
- Still?
- You got a minute?

12:13.508 --> 12:15.503
We'd like to show you
some pictures.

12:15.576 --> 12:17.702
Angelina Jolie,
I hope.

12:19.876 --> 12:22.313
These the gentlemen?

12:23.418 --> 12:24.640
That's them.

12:27.756 --> 12:29.982
What the fuck?
What?

12:30.055 --> 12:32.481
Don't know.
Financing, maybe.

12:32.557 --> 12:34.452
- Maybe?
- Yeah.

12:34.528 --> 12:37.792
Honestly, I'm not even sure we
still have them in the country.

12:39.326 --> 12:40.832
Thanks
for stopping by.

12:42.236 --> 12:44.460
Next time we'll have
party hats.

12:47.037 --> 12:49.471
Hey.

12:55.948 --> 12:57.512
Your nephew's widow,

12:57.586 --> 12:59.550
She get my flowers?

12:59.615 --> 13:02.110
Well, if you sent 'em,
I'm sure she did.

13:02.185 --> 13:04.882
Well, I won't expect
a thank you anytime soon.

13:04.957 --> 13:08.252
The grieving process, it takes
time the closer you are to somebody.

13:08.325 --> 13:10.121
Yeah, I know.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.433
So, brass tacks,

13:15.497 --> 13:17.903
What brings you
all the way out to the city?

13:17.967 --> 13:20.631
Good news. The condos
at the navy yard--

13:20.708 --> 13:22.431
Paulie's guy at
the joint fitters

13:22.507 --> 13:24.043
Says they're
breaking ground.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.442
- Well, that is good.
- Good, yeah.

13:29.718 --> 13:32.983
Uh, the other thing,
this asbestos--

13:33.057 --> 13:35.952
I thought about
your offer.

13:36.017 --> 13:37.882
What do you say
to 15%

13:37.956 --> 13:39.721
Plus we forget
about the balance

13:39.797 --> 13:41.891
Of what you owe me
on the vitamin truck?

13:41.958 --> 13:43.990
First off,
it wasn't an offer.

13:44.066 --> 13:47.393
It's my position: 25%.

13:47.465 --> 13:49.763
That's it?

13:49.836 --> 13:51.930
What else would you
like me to say?

13:52.008 --> 13:54.602
Come on, Phil,
what's the problem?

13:54.677 --> 13:56.742
I come here
in good faith,

13:56.807 --> 13:58.741
I make a reasonable
counter.

13:58.807 --> 14:02.443
Which I considered...
and rejected.

14:02.515 --> 14:04.140
Do we need to talk
in private?

14:04.215 --> 14:05.911
For what?

14:07.717 --> 14:10.323
Okay then, in front
of everybody...

14:12.087 --> 14:13.521
when you were sick

14:13.597 --> 14:15.551
In the hospital,

14:15.628 --> 14:18.063
We talked.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.493
We shared a...

14:22.697 --> 14:25.863
an understanding
about life.

14:25.936 --> 14:27.401
This is business, Anthony.

14:27.476 --> 14:29.273
Yeah, I know.

14:29.338 --> 14:32.973
But I'm talking to you
here on a human level.

14:33.046 --> 14:36.213
There's a limit, Phil.
Come on.

14:36.286 --> 14:39.851
A point where business
bleeds into other shit,

14:39.917 --> 14:43.783
Feelings make things
financially unfeasible.

14:44.956 --> 14:46.350
Charles schwab
over here.

14:53.667 --> 14:56.460
So that's it?

14:56.537 --> 15:00.870
No leeway, no compromise,
just stupid fuckin' jokes?

15:00.938 --> 15:04.170
You want compromise?
How's this?

15:04.245 --> 15:06.141
20 years in the can,

15:06.215 --> 15:07.810
I wanted manicott'.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.281
I compromised.

15:10.345 --> 15:13.983
I ate grilled cheese
off the radiator instead.

15:14.057 --> 15:16.221
I wanted
to fuck a woman,

15:16.287 --> 15:18.281
But I compromised.

15:18.356 --> 15:20.552
I jacked off
in a tissue.

15:20.627 --> 15:22.421
You see where
I'm going?

15:22.497 --> 15:24.090
Yeah.

15:34.937 --> 15:38.571
- Butch, coco, didn't anybody call you guys?
- About what?

15:38.647 --> 15:42.842
- Don't tell me the fuckin' checks are late?
- There ain't any checks.

15:42.915 --> 15:45.943
- The fuck you talkin' about?
- Silvio-- Mr. Soprano's guy--

15:46.015 --> 15:48.450
Came by this morning,
said to pull your jobs.

15:48.518 --> 15:50.351
- Whoa whoa whoa.
- Fuck that.

15:50.506 --> 15:52.792
- Where's our money?
- I don't got it, there's no jobs.

15:52.856 --> 15:54.922
Motherfucker.

15:54.998 --> 15:57.391
I'm sorry, guys. Somebody
really should have called you.

15:58.565 --> 16:00.592
<i>Hey!</i>

16:00.666 --> 16:02.291
<i>- Jesus Christ!
- Ho!</i>

16:06.335 --> 16:08.730
Guys, that's enough, come on.
It's not his fault.

16:08.805 --> 16:11.672
- Oh, yeah? Maybe it's
your fuckin' fault?

16:13.515 --> 16:15.240
Call the police!

16:22.716 --> 16:25.981
Tony Soprano
owes you $320.

16:34.137 --> 16:35.730
Hey.

16:38.935 --> 16:41.372
I was just watching
"borat" on cable.

16:41.438 --> 16:44.942
You can watch that thing 50
times and it's still hilarious.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.413
He brings that lady
his shits.

16:49.746 --> 16:51.983
It wasn't fair
to the people involved.

16:52.047 --> 16:54.910
You loved it
when it came out.

16:54.988 --> 16:57.321
What do you want,
Meadow?

16:57.388 --> 17:00.323
- How was your exam?
- I didn't take it.

17:03.865 --> 17:05.492
<i>Leave that!</i>

17:05.565 --> 17:08.131
Okay?
Thank you.

17:14.876 --> 17:16.772
Why didn't you
take the test?

17:16.845 --> 17:19.742
'Cause I dropped out,
okay?

17:19.818 --> 17:21.742
What's going on
with you?

17:23.518 --> 17:24.842
<i>I'm your sister,</i>

17:24.917 --> 17:26.851
You have
to talk to me.

17:26.916 --> 17:29.383
<i>Is this still
about blanca?</i>

17:30.888 --> 17:33.290
You know, I don't
know anymore.

17:36.898 --> 17:39.260
I know how
you feel, okay?

17:39.325 --> 17:42.862
When Finn and I split,
I cried every day

17:42.936 --> 17:44.630
For, like, a month.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.732
You realize we're
gonna bomb iran?

17:46.807 --> 17:48.872
You don't know that.

17:48.935 --> 17:50.502
You watch.

17:50.575 --> 17:53.871
Bush, before he
leaves office--

17:53.948 --> 17:56.741
And you know
I'm right.

17:56.816 --> 17:59.710
Okay.

17:59.785 --> 18:03.022
But you need to learn
to shut stuff out.

18:03.087 --> 18:05.183
Are you crazy?

18:05.257 --> 18:07.750
I mean, do you hear
what we're talking about?

18:07.828 --> 18:09.820
You say that,
but I come in here

18:09.897 --> 18:12.022
And you're surfing
the web for porn.

18:12.127 --> 18:13.962
It's not porn.

18:21.707 --> 18:23.373
"Al jazeera"?

18:23.445 --> 18:26.710
Don't you ever feel like
there's no point to any of this?

18:26.777 --> 18:30.481
Why don't you try
setting goals for yourself?

18:30.548 --> 18:32.911
Maybe you
should move out?

18:32.988 --> 18:35.083
Oh right,
in my condition?

18:35.158 --> 18:37.122
I mean, I can't
hold a job.

18:37.188 --> 18:39.890
Jesus, A.J., there has to
be something you can do.

18:39.957 --> 18:42.921
Look, I'm ill, Meadow.
All right, I'm on medication.

18:42.997 --> 18:46.162
Millions of people
take lexapro.

18:46.238 --> 18:48.091
I need mom's cooking.

18:48.166 --> 18:50.160
It could mess
with my blood chemistry.

18:50.236 --> 18:51.962
Do mom and dad know
you dropped out?

18:52.035 --> 18:54.370
No, and don't
tell them.

18:54.435 --> 18:56.301
I took time off,
remember?

18:56.376 --> 18:59.512
They broke my balls
but it really wasn't so bad.

18:59.577 --> 19:02.072
Of course not.
I mean, you're their pet.

19:02.145 --> 19:05.212
We're Italian, A.J.
You're their son.

19:05.287 --> 19:07.682
Do you have any idea
what that means?

19:09.388 --> 19:11.822
You'll always be
more important.

19:13.725 --> 19:15.823
<i>You're awake.</i>

19:20.735 --> 19:22.903
I made lincoln log
sandwiches.

19:22.965 --> 19:24.931
Maybe later.

19:29.845 --> 19:31.601
I am meeting gab
for lunch,

19:31.676 --> 19:34.540
And then we are
stopping at nordstrom's.

19:36.116 --> 19:39.812
If you go out, make sure
you set the alarm.

19:39.886 --> 19:41.682
Okay?

21:03.305 --> 21:05.431
Jeez!

21:17.747 --> 21:20.083
Ah!

21:52.417 --> 21:54.110
<i>Somebody!</i>

21:54.186 --> 21:56.150
<i>Help!</i>

21:58.458 --> 22:00.551
Help!

22:06.995 --> 22:10.600
Help! My arms!
They're frozen!

22:10.667 --> 22:13.002
A.J., what the fuck?

22:13.078 --> 22:15.733
Dad! Help--!

22:15.805 --> 22:18.173
<i>Help!</i>

22:24.418 --> 22:26.012
No, dad!
Ah!

22:28.288 --> 22:30.582
- My leg, it's stuck!
- On what?

22:30.656 --> 22:33.093
Huh?

22:33.157 --> 22:35.693
What the fuck
did you do?

22:35.755 --> 22:38.392
Hel-- Help!

22:45.735 --> 22:48.073
All right, I got you.
Stop fighting me.

22:51.107 --> 22:52.543
- All right...
- Don't--

22:52.608 --> 22:55.010
All right, turn around.
Grab the side.

22:55.078 --> 22:57.182
Grab the side
right there.

22:57.248 --> 22:58.910
All right.

23:07.526 --> 23:09.223
All right.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.860
God damn it.

23:16.666 --> 23:19.531
Hold that.

23:24.276 --> 23:25.700
Help me.

23:25.778 --> 23:28.043
All right,
climb!

23:28.115 --> 23:30.080
Ah!

23:42.658 --> 23:44.623
What's wrong
with you?!

23:49.338 --> 23:51.603
All right.
Are you all right?

23:54.578 --> 23:56.571
All right, come here.

23:56.646 --> 23:58.342
Come on.

23:58.405 --> 24:00.541
Turn around.

24:00.617 --> 24:02.373
Come on, baby.

24:02.448 --> 24:04.913
<i>You're all right, baby.</i>

24:04.985 --> 24:07.850
You're all right, baby.
You're all right.

24:09.686 --> 24:11.683
You're all right.

24:17.668 --> 24:20.132
Well, here we are.

24:20.198 --> 24:23.203
I'll get him settled. You can come
tomorrow during visiting hours.

24:23.268 --> 24:25.331
I love you, sweetie.

24:26.578 --> 24:29.033
- I love you.
- I love you too.

24:29.105 --> 24:31.101
<i>He's had a lot
of valium.</i>

24:56.608 --> 24:59.870
But he was better
for a while.

24:59.938 --> 25:01.772
Look, it's not
your fault.

25:01.836 --> 25:04.740
You warned us.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.340
Come on, come on.

25:12.548 --> 25:15.313
Come on,
it's gonna be okay.

25:15.388 --> 25:17.282
It will, mom.

25:17.355 --> 25:19.992
But he was always
so happy.

25:20.055 --> 25:22.691
He was our
happy little boy.

25:24.627 --> 25:26.790
I mean, God.

25:29.707 --> 25:31.361
Come here, baby.

25:34.605 --> 25:36.970
There you go.
White walls.

25:47.155 --> 25:49.110
<i>- Skip.
- Hey, Ton'.</i>

25:52.625 --> 25:54.750
There he is.

25:54.828 --> 25:57.590
You hungry, t? You want, I'll
send the kid for baja fresh.

25:57.666 --> 26:00.493
Anything from Phil?

26:00.568 --> 26:02.291
No, not yet.

26:10.606 --> 26:14.672
All right, let's dispense with the
500-Lb elephant in the room, eh?

26:14.748 --> 26:17.012
My kid tried
to off himself.

26:17.088 --> 26:19.140
<i>We all fuckin' know.</i>

26:25.655 --> 26:27.350
That's it.

26:28.455 --> 26:30.763
Nobody's got
nothing to say?

26:32.298 --> 26:33.763
How's he doin', Ton'?

26:35.635 --> 26:37.903
They got him
under observation.

26:37.967 --> 26:39.900
Whatever the fuck
that means.

26:42.637 --> 26:44.771
Stupid fuck.

26:47.915 --> 26:51.143
Where did I lose
this kid?

26:51.215 --> 26:52.783
What did I do wrong?

26:52.886 --> 26:54.610
Whoa, come on.

26:54.687 --> 26:56.350
Don't blame
yourself, t.

26:56.428 --> 26:59.022
A lot of pressure
on kids today, Ton'.

26:59.088 --> 27:00.990
Still, to try
to kill himself?

27:01.058 --> 27:03.790
It's happens, skip.

27:03.868 --> 27:06.432
Happen to your kids?

27:06.498 --> 27:08.131
Or yours?

27:08.198 --> 27:09.762
They're all
different, Ton'.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.260
My son patrick?

27:11.338 --> 27:13.230
I love him to death,

27:13.305 --> 27:15.073
But he can be a moody prick sometimes.

27:15.136 --> 27:17.402
Heather, you know,
she was 15,

27:17.476 --> 27:19.870
She went through
a rough patch.

27:19.945 --> 27:21.173
<i>Jason, same thing.</i>

27:21.245 --> 27:23.743
And he's got the hyperactivity to boot.

27:23.818 --> 27:27.911
My son too.
The older one, James.

27:27.987 --> 27:29.980
- He tried to kill himself?
- No no.

27:30.106 --> 27:34.291
I don't know, he--
He gets the blues.

27:34.356 --> 27:38.191
The important thing is A.J.'S
getting the help he needs.

27:38.267 --> 27:41.562
Whatever it is, I'm sure
it's a chemical imbalance.

27:41.635 --> 27:44.861
Ask me, it's all these
toxins they're exposed to.

27:44.938 --> 27:46.901
It fucks
with their brains.

27:46.975 --> 27:48.803
Between the mercury
in fish alone,

27:48.878 --> 27:51.643
It's a wonder there ain't
more kids jumping off bridges.

28:14.297 --> 28:16.261
I can't
fuckin' shake it.

28:16.335 --> 28:18.903
Shake what?

28:18.967 --> 28:21.871
- I'm depressed.
- Excuse me?

28:21.935 --> 28:23.972
I'm depressed.

28:24.046 --> 28:27.013
I'm telling you,
don't you start now.

28:27.075 --> 28:29.273
- What does that mean?
- It means what it means.

28:29.348 --> 28:32.683
I have enough on my plate, I don't need
you adding to it with your bullshit.

28:32.757 --> 28:34.013
Bullshit?

28:34.085 --> 28:35.883
It's an illness.

28:35.958 --> 28:37.351
And it's fuckin'
hereditary.

28:37.427 --> 28:38.820
Thank you, I know.

28:38.888 --> 28:41.551
I am intimately acquainted
with the Soprano curse.

28:41.628 --> 28:44.023
Your father, your uncle,
your great-Grandfather

28:44.096 --> 28:46.433
Who drove the donkey cart
off the road in avellino,

28:46.498 --> 28:48.862
- All of it.
- What, you think it's a joke?

28:48.935 --> 28:51.961
- Am I laughing?
- Then what are you saying?

28:56.177 --> 28:58.373
He didn't get it
from my family,

28:58.447 --> 29:01.111
That's all
I'm gonna say.

29:01.176 --> 29:02.982
Your family don't
even talk.

29:03.047 --> 29:04.612
Your father's
so bottled up

29:04.688 --> 29:06.750
It's a wonder he's even
got a stomach left.

29:06.816 --> 29:10.182
- As opposed to yours?
- At least my father was upfront about what was bothering him.

29:10.257 --> 29:13.923
- Right, with a bullet through your mother's beehive hairdo.
- Oh, I knew it.

29:13.996 --> 29:16.820
I was wondering how long it was gonna
take for you to throw that up at me.

29:16.898 --> 29:18.390
You're amazing,
you know that?

29:18.468 --> 29:21.860
In high school, you were
the happy-Go-Lucky rascal,

29:21.937 --> 29:24.261
The comedian,
the rapscallion.

29:24.337 --> 29:26.170
But all of that was bullshit, wasn't it?

29:26.238 --> 29:27.830
Oh, poor you.

29:27.908 --> 29:30.040
She got married
under false pretenses.

29:30.108 --> 29:32.040
You've been playing
the depression card

29:32.108 --> 29:34.242
Until it is worn
to shreds.

29:34.315 --> 29:36.613
And now you've got
our son doing it.

29:36.685 --> 29:38.410
Card? Card?

29:38.488 --> 29:39.653
You heard me.

29:39.717 --> 29:41.080
Oh, so it's
all me, huh?

29:41.155 --> 29:43.683
Our Sonny boy? You had
nothing to do with it?

29:43.758 --> 29:46.853
It wears you down, Tony.
That's all I'm saying.

29:46.928 --> 29:49.961
Do you have any idea what it's
like to spend day after day

29:50.028 --> 29:52.460
With somebody who is
constantly complaining?

29:54.998 --> 29:56.300
Fuck you.

30:14.758 --> 30:17.080
It could have been
a cry for help.

30:17.155 --> 30:20.150
<i>Aren't you listening?
He did cry for help.</i>

30:20.228 --> 30:22.763
<i>He's lucky I came
home and heard him.</i>

30:22.828 --> 30:25.190
I meant
the botched attempt.

30:25.266 --> 30:27.590
<i>On some level,
he may have known</i>

30:27.666 --> 30:30.500
That the rope was too long
to keep him submerged.

30:30.567 --> 30:33.070
Or he could just be
a fuckin' idiot.

30:33.135 --> 30:35.301
Historically,
that's been the case.

30:39.145 --> 30:42.311
Me and Carm were
getting along so good too.

30:45.715 --> 30:47.953
My father and his
panic attacks,

30:48.018 --> 30:50.083
My fuckin'
demented uncle,

30:50.157 --> 30:54.820
Not to mention the other one--
Eckley the fuckin' retard.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.460
You think there are other reasons
why your son is so unhappy?

30:58.527 --> 31:02.032
He's got the world
by the balls--

31:02.097 --> 31:04.332
Every fuckin' advantage--

31:04.406 --> 31:07.830
And he hits one little pothole
and he goes into hysterics.

31:11.346 --> 31:13.170
Yeah, I know.

31:15.815 --> 31:17.743
I'm not taking
the rap,

31:17.817 --> 31:19.110
Not completely.

31:21.017 --> 31:23.522
She coddled him, his mother.
I said it before.

31:25.858 --> 31:28.192
Every little problem,
she's right there

31:28.256 --> 31:30.192
To pick him up
and wipe off his tears

31:30.266 --> 31:32.362
On her apron strings.

31:32.427 --> 31:35.061
Children need
to feel safe.

31:35.136 --> 31:37.732
I'm sure that made him
into the man he is today.

31:37.806 --> 31:40.030
Are you ashamed of him?

31:44.506 --> 31:46.643
Yeah, actually I am.

31:47.877 --> 31:49.843
The coward's way out.

31:49.917 --> 31:51.641
Isn't that
what they call it?

31:51.716 --> 31:55.780
I think whoever said that
didn't understand depression.

31:55.858 --> 31:59.052
But you do, don't you?

32:10.837 --> 32:12.133
Where's dad?

32:12.208 --> 32:15.000
Oh, Meadow got rear-Ended
on bloomfield avenue.

32:15.077 --> 32:18.171
- He'll come see you later.
- Is he still mad?

32:18.247 --> 32:20.011
He was never mad, A.J.

32:20.075 --> 32:21.511
He loves you.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.650
How long do
I have to stay here?

32:26.718 --> 32:28.710
Dr. Vogel thinks it
might be a good idea

32:28.788 --> 32:31.652
For the time being
just to take a time-Out.

32:31.725 --> 32:33.223
Like I'm in preschool?

32:46.067 --> 32:48.100
Did you see
Dr. Vogel today?

32:48.175 --> 32:50.170
Today we have group.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.151
Did you eat today?

33:01.216 --> 33:03.923
I had some turkey.
It had no flavor at all.

33:03.988 --> 33:06.750
I'll bring some
chicken parm tomorrow.

33:08.126 --> 33:09.790
I don't think
that's allowed

33:09.866 --> 33:11.822
On account of all
the bulimic girls.

33:17.008 --> 33:19.832
So it's front-Row mezzanine
at "grey gardens,"

33:19.906 --> 33:21.470
- And the guy says--
- Excuse me?

33:22.946 --> 33:25.742
- You're Tony Soprano's kid, right?
- Yeah.

33:25.808 --> 33:28.573
Small world, running
into you like this, huh?

33:28.648 --> 33:30.141
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

33:30.218 --> 33:32.781
You got a little cream
on your mouth there, sweetie.

33:32.888 --> 33:34.950
Be happy to add to it.

33:35.015 --> 33:36.353
<i>- What?
- Excuse me.</i>

33:36.428 --> 33:38.380
<i>Lucky guy, her dad.</i>

33:38.458 --> 33:41.550
Must be fun tucking her
in at night, huh?

33:41.628 --> 33:44.322
- Do you have a problem?
- Not yet.

33:44.398 --> 33:46.492
Would you like one?

33:46.567 --> 33:48.031
Coco, come on.

33:48.097 --> 33:49.800
What?
I'm saying hello.

33:49.868 --> 33:51.830
Come on,
let's go.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.771
Hey, best to
your dad, huh?

34:01.015 --> 34:02.841
What the hell
was that?

34:05.985 --> 34:08.313
...but that is not
for you to decide.

34:08.388 --> 34:10.822
Don't say anything.

34:12.858 --> 34:15.250
What, are you two talking
about me again?

34:20.268 --> 34:21.931
What's the matter?

34:21.996 --> 34:23.533
Nothing.

34:25.005 --> 34:26.731
What?

34:30.578 --> 34:32.739
Do you know a guy
named coco?

34:32.815 --> 34:35.040
Why?

34:35.116 --> 34:36.911
She was out
on a date last night

34:36.985 --> 34:39.043
<i>And he came over
and pulled some crap.</i>

34:39.116 --> 34:40.813
What?

34:41.916 --> 34:43.422
How?

34:43.485 --> 34:45.150
We were in the city,
little Italy.

34:45.226 --> 34:47.020
We were
having dessert, and...

34:47.096 --> 34:48.722
he came up
out of nowhere

34:48.797 --> 34:51.521
And just started saying
all this weird stuff.

34:51.597 --> 34:53.931
What kind of weird stuff?

34:53.996 --> 34:55.690
How he'd like
to tuck me in at night.

34:55.766 --> 34:57.530
Stuff like that.

34:57.605 --> 35:01.103
- Tuck you in?
- I could smell the sambuca on his breath.

35:02.805 --> 35:05.370
What exactly
did he say?

35:05.446 --> 35:08.142
He came up to us

35:08.215 --> 35:10.813
And he asked me if
I was your daughter

35:10.885 --> 35:14.481
And then he said
I had whipped cream

35:14.556 --> 35:16.012
On my mouth.

35:16.086 --> 35:18.220
Yeah?

35:19.286 --> 35:20.921
What else did he say?

35:27.268 --> 35:29.702
It's all right.

35:29.766 --> 35:32.632
It's okay.
He's an idiot,

35:32.706 --> 35:34.770
But he's harmless.

35:36.006 --> 35:37.500
I'll talk
to somebody.

35:42.248 --> 35:44.042
So this boy
you're dating,

35:44.115 --> 35:46.651
This man,
who is he?

35:46.715 --> 35:49.353
You promise not to start
with an inquisition?

35:49.427 --> 35:51.721
Will you stop with all
the secrecy, please?

35:53.298 --> 35:57.162
- It's patrick Parisi, okay?
- You're kidding me?

35:57.227 --> 35:59.561
That's exactly why I didn't
want to tell you guys,

35:59.635 --> 36:01.191
And why he didn't tell
uncle Patsy.

36:02.907 --> 36:05.133
I thought he--
Where are you going?

36:05.207 --> 36:07.571
Meeting-- Sil.

36:07.635 --> 36:09.841
We have vogel later,
don't forget.

36:12.307 --> 36:14.240
I thought pat Parisi
was engaged.

36:14.316 --> 36:15.810
They broke it off.

36:15.877 --> 36:18.011
We kind of hooked up
at the "cleaver" premiere,

36:18.087 --> 36:20.310
We started talking.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.251
He's changed a lot.

36:22.318 --> 36:24.123
I really like him.

36:24.187 --> 36:26.623
So why the big mystery
all this time?

36:26.698 --> 36:29.292
I knew you and daddy
never liked him.

36:29.358 --> 36:30.992
No, it's not that
we didn't like him,

36:31.066 --> 36:32.691
It's just...

36:34.995 --> 36:37.332
so all those times
you told me

36:37.408 --> 36:39.732
You were staying with your
friend kimmie in the city,

36:39.807 --> 36:42.072
I suppose you were staying
at his apartment?

36:42.135 --> 36:43.570
Sometimes.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.212
Look, there's
something else.

36:49.276 --> 36:51.081
What?

36:52.548 --> 36:54.913
I've decided not
to go to med school.

36:54.988 --> 36:57.022
What? Why?

36:57.086 --> 36:59.350
Oh, it's just too hard.

36:59.426 --> 37:02.993
- Isn't anything that's worthwhile?
- You have no idea.

37:03.067 --> 37:05.963
<i>- Of course not.
- Don't get sarcastic.</i>

37:06.027 --> 37:08.962
I really think
it's law for me.

37:09.038 --> 37:12.501
I mean, you should hear patrick
talk about the justice system

37:12.565 --> 37:14.330
And what it means.

37:14.405 --> 37:16.372
It's really inspiring.

37:29.857 --> 37:33.822
Obviously Sheila resents me.
I'm dating her father.

37:34.825 --> 37:38.423
The sullen looks,
the transference to me

37:38.498 --> 37:40.333
Of her issues
with her mom...

37:40.395 --> 37:42.193
as your favorite
patient says,

37:42.266 --> 37:45.002
"Maybe I should put
my shoe up her ass?"

37:45.067 --> 37:47.771
Which patient of mine
says that?

37:47.837 --> 37:49.271
Mine, Elliot.

37:49.335 --> 37:51.941
Your favorite patient
of mine?

37:52.006 --> 37:54.141
Oh.

37:54.217 --> 37:57.182
He hasn't been
in the paper much lately.

37:57.248 --> 37:59.412
You miss that,
don't you?

37:59.485 --> 38:02.081
My father was a rabid
"untouchables" fan.

38:02.155 --> 38:03.853
Make of that
what you will.

38:08.928 --> 38:10.190
What, Elliot?

38:10.266 --> 38:12.830
I ran into nancy duggan
last week.

38:12.897 --> 38:15.793
- Do you know nancy?
- Vaguely.

38:15.865 --> 38:17.700
She's on staff
at rikers island,

38:17.767 --> 38:20.400
Works with a lot of
sociopaths, as you can imagine.

38:20.475 --> 38:24.043
Anyway, she told me
something interesting.

38:24.107 --> 38:27.171
A lot of studies
about talk therapy

38:27.246 --> 38:29.710
As it relates
to sociopaths

38:29.786 --> 38:30.883
<i>And criminals,</i>

38:30.945 --> 38:34.411
One of them is the
criminal personality

38:34.487 --> 38:37.483
Conducted by yochelson
at St. Elizabeth's.

38:37.555 --> 38:39.352
<i>Essentially</i>

38:39.426 --> 38:41.250
It concludes

38:41.325 --> 38:43.620
That talk therapy,

38:43.696 --> 38:47.160
While not only being
useless with sociopaths,

38:47.238 --> 38:49.860
Actually serves
to validate them.

38:51.708 --> 38:54.900
Yochelson says they sharpen
their skills as conmen

38:54.975 --> 38:57.943
On their therapists.

38:58.005 --> 39:01.170
Crocodile tears,
what have you.

39:01.245 --> 39:03.280
Why are you smirking?

39:03.348 --> 39:05.880
- I'm not.
- Oh really?

39:05.946 --> 39:08.552
We showed data.

39:08.617 --> 39:11.550
The one-Year
reconviction rates

39:11.627 --> 39:14.253
Were higher for offenders in therapy

39:14.327 --> 39:17.760
Than for those receiving
no treatment at all.

39:25.968 --> 39:28.932
Uh, some peppers
and cheese.

39:29.006 --> 39:31.671
<i>Eh, gorgonzola,
all right? Don't forget.</i>

39:35.176 --> 39:36.242
Whoa whoa!

39:36.316 --> 39:37.811
Sit down.

39:37.885 --> 39:40.180
- Sit down.
- Easy easy.

39:42.588 --> 39:45.482
You motherfucker.
My fucking daughter?

39:45.558 --> 39:48.351
My fucking daughter,
you motherfucker.

39:48.427 --> 39:50.023
My fuckin' daughter!

39:51.125 --> 39:52.792
Hey, want some
sambuca with this?

39:52.866 --> 39:55.791
Tony, you're making
a big fuckin' mistake here.

39:57.935 --> 40:00.531
How about I put a bullet
in your fuckin' head, huh?

40:09.046 --> 40:10.710
Don't do it!

40:17.155 --> 40:18.721
You want some?

40:34.206 --> 40:36.140
<i>It's always what
you think, isn't it?</i>

40:36.208 --> 40:38.401
<i>It's never how I feel.</i>

40:40.518 --> 40:42.511
Oh, poor you.

40:42.575 --> 40:44.541
It's all your mother's
fault, isn't it?

40:44.616 --> 40:47.510
- I didn't say that.
- You're a mama's boy.

40:47.587 --> 40:49.482
You're gonna
call me names now?

40:49.555 --> 40:51.683
No one is calling
anyone any names.

40:51.758 --> 40:53.252
How about
my confirmation?

40:53.327 --> 40:54.891
You called me
an animal.

40:54.956 --> 40:56.621
I did not!

40:56.696 --> 40:58.891
I was in the garage
and you said,

40:58.966 --> 41:01.861
"What kind of animal smokes
marijuana at his confirmation?"

41:01.938 --> 41:05.363
He was using illegal drugs
in the home.

41:05.436 --> 41:09.943
Did it ever occur to you that I
might have been self-Medicating?

41:10.007 --> 41:11.941
Give me a break,
will you?

41:13.177 --> 41:15.872
And how about
second grade?

41:15.948 --> 41:18.642
You made me show up to
school in that dorky raincoat.

41:19.786 --> 41:21.553
I got beat up
because of it.

41:23.925 --> 41:27.352
You would hole
up in that room for hours.

41:27.427 --> 41:31.920
Because I was never really secure
expressing my feelings in that house.

41:31.996 --> 41:34.133
I mean, that's why.

41:40.876 --> 41:44.143
What kind of poem is that
to teach college students?

41:51.588 --> 41:53.281
Would you like
to tell your parents

41:53.355 --> 41:55.050
What your
grandmother said?

41:55.115 --> 41:57.080
My mother?

41:59.956 --> 42:02.793
Grandma--
Dad's mom.

42:02.867 --> 42:04.722
What'd she say?

42:04.795 --> 42:07.162
That it's all
a big nothing.

42:07.238 --> 42:09.032
What is?

42:09.097 --> 42:10.832
Life.

42:14.135 --> 42:15.771
That was her,
all right.

42:15.836 --> 42:18.272
Okay, fine, she said
those kinds of things--

42:18.346 --> 42:20.872
She sat up in bed--

42:20.945 --> 42:23.511
When she could
hardly move.

42:23.586 --> 42:25.411
She could hardly
breathe.

42:27.156 --> 42:31.251
She said in the end that your
friends and family let you down,

42:31.328 --> 42:33.920
And that you die
in your own arms.

42:33.996 --> 42:35.621
When was this?

42:35.698 --> 42:37.522
When she was
in that nursing home

42:37.597 --> 42:39.093
And you used
to make me go see her.

42:45.466 --> 42:48.131
We're not too young
to be grandpas.

42:53.215 --> 42:55.211
Ton'?

42:55.276 --> 42:57.641
Carmine Lupertazzi.

42:57.716 --> 42:59.950
- I'll see you later, skip.
- All right.

43:02.087 --> 43:03.721
We should have dinner,

43:03.786 --> 43:05.821
You know, Carm,
Donna, maybe the kids.

43:05.886 --> 43:06.952
Yeah.

43:07.028 --> 43:09.493
I hear wedding bells
are in the air.

43:14.967 --> 43:16.803
You want anything?

43:16.866 --> 43:18.602
No, I'm good.

43:27.016 --> 43:29.780
If there's anything I can
do, Tony, for Anthony jr....

43:29.845 --> 43:31.810
thank you.

43:31.885 --> 43:34.710
When alexandra had
that bout of anorexia,

43:34.786 --> 43:37.081
We had this terrific
psychologist.

43:37.155 --> 43:39.623
She tried to kill herself,
your daughter?

43:39.698 --> 43:41.193
No.

43:41.257 --> 43:43.823
She had serious problems
though, didn't she?

43:43.895 --> 43:46.661
Not really.
It's all under control.

43:49.707 --> 43:51.663
So...

43:51.738 --> 43:53.703
the reason I'm here

43:53.778 --> 43:55.330
You could
probably guess.

43:55.405 --> 43:58.341
What happened
at coco's restaurant.

43:58.405 --> 44:01.770
This alteration
you had with him--

44:01.847 --> 44:03.882
You're at
the precipice, Tony,

44:03.946 --> 44:06.212
Of an enormous crossroad.

44:06.288 --> 44:09.523
Phil's considering shutting
down the hackensack mall project

44:09.586 --> 44:11.623
With a plumbing strike
as we speak.

44:11.685 --> 44:13.723
Fuck it.
Let him.

44:13.796 --> 44:16.220
Easy for you. I have
the scaffolding contract.

44:16.298 --> 44:18.191
Oh, is that what
this is about, Carmine?

44:18.266 --> 44:19.590
What do I owe you?

44:19.668 --> 44:22.760
Come on, huh?
You know me better than that.

44:22.838 --> 44:25.433
My daughter, Carmine.
My daughter.

44:26.476 --> 44:28.273
You got a little girl.

44:28.337 --> 44:29.803
You almost
killed the guy.

44:29.875 --> 44:32.540
I should've killed him.
I'd have had total support,

44:32.608 --> 44:36.182
- But I held myself back!
- You were being prudent.

44:36.247 --> 44:37.942
Fuck that.

44:41.657 --> 44:43.380
I lost it.

44:44.758 --> 44:47.392
Timing couldn't have been
worse, but what the fuck?

44:47.456 --> 44:49.292
So you go to Phil,

44:49.357 --> 44:51.822
I go with you,
hats in hand,

44:51.895 --> 44:53.091
Bended knees.

45:07.145 --> 45:10.013
Why me, huh?

45:10.085 --> 45:12.541
Doesn't every parent
make mistakes?

45:12.617 --> 45:15.112
Why not you?

45:15.188 --> 45:16.982
'Cause I'm
a good guy...

45:17.056 --> 45:18.750
basically.

45:20.496 --> 45:22.323
I love my family.

45:24.667 --> 45:27.431
There's a balance.
There's a ying and a yang.

45:27.497 --> 45:28.960
Huh?

45:34.737 --> 45:38.471
You think you know.
You think you learned something.

45:40.277 --> 45:41.872
Like when I got shot.

45:41.945 --> 45:44.442
Know what?

45:47.585 --> 45:49.920
All right.

45:49.988 --> 45:54.123
When I was in Las Vegas,
I took peyote.

45:55.455 --> 45:58.021
Curiosity,
I don't know.

45:58.096 --> 45:59.891
You were searching
for something.

46:02.135 --> 46:05.631
Well, I saw some things.
Not...

46:05.705 --> 46:07.831
things, per se,
hallucinations,

46:07.908 --> 46:09.902
<i>Roger corman shit.</i>

46:09.978 --> 46:13.612
- It was kind of disappointing, there wasn't any of that.
- What was there?

46:13.675 --> 46:15.542
It's kind of hard
to describe.

46:17.445 --> 46:20.010
I mean, you've done it, right?
Acid, shit like that.

46:20.085 --> 46:21.513
No.

46:27.727 --> 46:30.121
All I can say is

46:30.197 --> 46:33.731
I saw,
for pretty certain,

46:33.795 --> 46:35.933
That this...

46:35.996 --> 46:38.430
<i>everything we see
and experience,</i>

46:38.508 --> 46:40.133
Is not all there is.

46:40.207 --> 46:42.703
What else is there?

46:43.748 --> 46:45.801
Something else.

46:48.417 --> 46:50.243
But that's as far as
I'm gonna go with it.

46:50.317 --> 46:53.113
I don't fuckin' know.

46:53.186 --> 46:55.410
Alternate universes?

46:55.488 --> 46:57.353
You gonna be
a fuckin' comedian now?

46:57.427 --> 46:59.150
I'm not.

47:01.355 --> 47:02.520
Maybe.

47:04.826 --> 47:07.132
This is gonna
sound stupid...

47:09.095 --> 47:12.333
but I saw at one point
that our mothers are...

47:15.405 --> 47:18.470
they're bus drivers.

47:22.945 --> 47:25.213
They're--
No, they are the bus.

47:25.288 --> 47:28.313
See, they're the vehicle
that gets us here.

47:28.386 --> 47:32.023
They drop us off
and go on their way.

47:32.088 --> 47:33.990
They continue
on their journey.

47:34.057 --> 47:37.361
And the problem is that we keep
trying to get back on the bus,

47:37.425 --> 47:40.332
Instead of just
letting it go.

47:44.636 --> 47:46.872
That's very insightful.

47:46.936 --> 47:49.130
Jesus, don't act
so surprised.

47:57.987 --> 48:00.082
You know...

48:00.157 --> 48:03.250
you have these thoughts,
and you almost grab it.

48:03.325 --> 48:05.680
<i>And then...</i>

48:05.757 --> 48:08.052
pfft.

48:13.997 --> 48:15.731
Butch, how are you?

48:15.798 --> 48:18.762
Phil is not accepting
visitors right now.

48:18.837 --> 48:20.870
I just talked to him
on the phone, butchie.

48:20.938 --> 48:22.530
I just talked
to him in person.

48:22.606 --> 48:24.342
He ain't seeing nobody.

48:24.407 --> 48:26.211
What's going on, butch?

48:26.277 --> 48:28.172
I just brokered
this thing.

48:28.247 --> 48:30.281
He came here to make
a peace offering.

48:30.346 --> 48:32.881
A semi-Trailer of drills--
Makitas.

48:32.958 --> 48:35.413
We don't want
your fuckin' drills.

48:35.485 --> 48:36.983
Fuck it.

48:37.056 --> 48:38.683
Let's go.

48:54.208 --> 48:56.571
<i>That's right, cocksucker!</i>

48:56.648 --> 48:59.171
- Go back to new Jersey!
- Phil, what are you doin'?

48:59.245 --> 49:01.913
Take that piece of shit
and get off my stoop.

49:01.978 --> 49:04.010
But we just
talked about this.

49:04.086 --> 49:05.980
Well, cooler heads
prevailed.

49:06.045 --> 49:09.050
- Uncle philly!
- Uncle philly my ass.

49:09.115 --> 49:11.651
Will you just come down
so we can discuss this?

49:11.725 --> 49:14.353
There's nothing left
to discuss, Carmine.

49:18.468 --> 49:20.163
I don't understand.

49:20.236 --> 49:22.232
Why is he like this?

49:28.105 --> 49:30.801
<i>Hey, it's sleeping beauty.</i>

49:30.878 --> 49:32.342
I didn't sleep a wink.

49:32.408 --> 49:34.373
<i>I know, we've been
waiting for you.</i>

49:34.448 --> 49:36.181
<i>We have the chess set
all ready.</i>

49:36.248 --> 49:39.113
<i>- He cheats.
- Hello, honest abe?</i>

49:39.186 --> 49:42.052
<i>- Whatever.
- We just haven't played for so long.</i>

49:42.116 --> 49:44.320
I know, I just got
all this stress at work.

49:44.385 --> 49:46.321
It's cool, it happens
to a lot of people.

49:46.395 --> 49:48.390
- Really?
- Absolutely.

49:48.455 --> 49:50.720
More than half of adults
report experiencing

49:50.796 --> 49:53.331
<i>Some kind of insomnia at
least a few nights a week.</i>

49:53.396 --> 49:55.633
<i>We just
want you back.</i>

49:55.696 --> 49:57.660
<i>- Thanks, guys.
- When you can't sleep...</i>

50:10.686 --> 50:12.752
no food in
the unit, sir.
