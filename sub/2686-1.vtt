Happiness

01:59.352 --> 02:01.115
You changed the combination?

02:03.056 --> 02:05.217
You're a bitch.

02:23.376 --> 02:24.843
I'm going abroad.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.008
For a year or two.
I'll call you when I get back.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.515
Don't bother.

02:32.952 --> 02:36.911
You can date.
I know you hate being alone.

02:38.858 --> 02:40.621
Look who's talking.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.132
But don't get married.
It'll complicate things.

02:54.474 --> 02:55.839
Look.

02:57.277 --> 02:59.142
We're through

03:01.881 --> 03:03.405
I gotta go to work.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.008
Sweetie!
Where are you going?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.616
Remember me?

04:19.158 --> 04:20.625
Dance with us.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.724
Come on.

04:25.365 --> 04:26.832
Sweetie...

04:27.567 --> 04:29.228
Come on.

04:39.879 --> 04:42.439
It's a lot this time.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.018
Going somewhere?

04:47.453 --> 04:48.818
Abroad.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.426
So, when are you giving me
your number?

04:57.864 --> 04:59.923
Your number?

05:00.667 --> 05:05.434
Including the medicine,
it's $298.

05:05.571 --> 05:08.335
How about an e-mail then?

05:09.475 --> 05:11.340
$298, please.

05:15.581 --> 05:18.106
- How much?
- $298.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.221
How are you, boss?

05:29.962 --> 05:31.930
I'm not your boss anymore.

05:32.765 --> 05:33.823
Give me a smoke.

05:36.369 --> 05:41.432
I'll pay you what I owe.
Don't worry.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.536
I said I'd pay you.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.621
Thanks for taking it over.

06:08.468 --> 06:12.632
Money ruins friendship.
This is it, okay?

06:16.075 --> 06:17.133
What's this?

06:17.577 --> 06:18.737
For you.

06:22.081 --> 06:23.309
Thanks.

06:25.651 --> 06:31.021
Wire the rest into my account.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.319
Can you make it there?

06:39.766 --> 06:41.324
I don't know.

06:43.369 --> 06:48.136
I have no other places to go.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.533
And I can't quit drinking.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.741
It's worse than I thought.

06:54.080 --> 06:57.709
Don't tell Su-yeon
I'm going to the sanatorium.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.215
It's embarrassing.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.622
Dong-jun?

07:06.759 --> 07:08.420
Am I bankrupt?

07:13.866 --> 07:15.128
Totally!

07:42.662 --> 07:46.325
Pump it up
until you feel the pressure.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.035
- You like it?
- Yes.

07:50.369 --> 07:51.734
It's boiling.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.839
Staying for the night?

07:56.976 --> 07:58.841
No way.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.610
Be careful, it's hot.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.523
Mom...

08:12.658 --> 08:14.125
I'm going abroad.

08:15.461 --> 08:17.622
For a few years.

08:23.870 --> 08:32.938
You hadn't come to see me
for a year and half.

08:34.981 --> 08:37.506
You can't fool me.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.618
Just come by now and then.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.309
That's all I want.

10:20.252 --> 10:21.810
How much do I owe you?

10:28.361 --> 10:30.420
I'm not the owner.

12:08.861 --> 12:09.919
Grandma.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.225
- Have You been waiting long?
- No.

12:13.365 --> 12:18.132
Two light bulbs, soap...
Here's $5.70.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.135
It's right.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.832
- Thanks.
- Bye.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.214
Grandma?

12:30.349 --> 12:32.715
- Yes?
- Call me a cab, will you?

13:09.755 --> 13:14.317
Many people come here dying
and leave all cured.

13:15.060 --> 13:19.326
Work out in the morning
and take care of vegetables

13:19.465 --> 13:22.127
And watch what you eat.

13:23.669 --> 13:27.730
No smoking, drinking,
and instant food.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.635
Smile for me.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.541
It's the greatest medicine.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.107
You don't smile much, do you?

13:39.051 --> 13:41.713
Give me five, will you?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.418
Put your hands up.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.820
Put them up.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.721
Let's go!

13:50.663 --> 13:53.029
You're not smiling.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.826
Eun-hee, come in.

13:57.469 --> 13:58.834
He's new.

14:00.573 --> 14:04.737
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask her.

14:06.178 --> 14:12.014
Put it down here
and give him a high-five.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.419
Put it down.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.316
Put your hands up.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.323
Both hands.

14:22.962 --> 14:25.430
Trying hard is important.

14:25.564 --> 14:30.024
But what's more important is
enjoying what you do.

14:30.169 --> 14:33.536
What's my point?
Enjoy every minute of your life!

14:33.672 --> 14:38.541
Ohne Sorgen, Polka Schnell
by J. Strauss.

15:18.951 --> 15:20.816
I smell cigarettes.

15:21.854 --> 15:23.412
Give me one.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.614
- Huh?
- a cigarette.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.425
I have lung cancer.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.134
Cirrhosis here.

15:39.872 --> 15:44.036
Quit smoking, okay?
It'll kill you.

15:46.979 --> 15:49.539
Go eat if you haven't eaten.

15:49.682 --> 15:52.014
Skipping meals isn't good.

16:13.672 --> 16:15.139
Wait.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.240
Have a seat.

16:21.780 --> 16:24.214
Excuse me?

16:24.350 --> 16:27.114
He hasn't eaten yet.
Make it salt-free.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.319
Sorry about earlier.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.537
You should quit drinking
and smoking.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.713
Damn!

17:32.451 --> 17:34.316
What the...

17:39.458 --> 17:41.323
- It's done?
- It's done.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.624
Come on, it's okay.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.725
- How are you?
- Hi.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.932
Sit here.

17:51.970 --> 17:54.131
Life is tough.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.434
But the air is good out here.

17:56.975 --> 17:58.943
Didn't I tell you
to make it mild?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.238
It's too salty.

18:00.379 --> 18:04.110
Whatever you enjoy eating,
it's good for you.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.217
That's bullshit.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.511
Here You go.

18:08.954 --> 18:11.320
Screw it.
I'll eat this and die.

18:11.457 --> 18:15.325
Too much isn't good for you.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.821
- Drink some.
- You don't drink?

18:20.766 --> 18:23.428
Anything not salty is okay.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.534
It's okay.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.238
Go ahead.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.314
- Good night, guys.
- Leaving already?

18:42.454 --> 18:45.821
He sure can drink.
No wonder he has cirrhosis.

18:51.563 --> 18:55.431
Everybody is looking good
this morning.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.831
Say hello to one another.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.438
- I love you.
- I love you.

19:00.572 --> 19:03.132
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.039
- Be determined.
- Be determined.

19:06.178 --> 19:10.512
- I'm healthy.
- I'm healthy.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.619
Breathe in.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.621
Out.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.526
Breathe in.

19:25.864 --> 19:27.126
Out.

19:28.967 --> 19:31.128
Breathe in.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.031
Out.

19:34.973 --> 19:36.338
One.

19:36.775 --> 19:38.333
Two.

19:38.477 --> 19:44.609
One, two...

19:45.350 --> 19:46.817
Faster.

19:47.352 --> 19:51.220
Stomp your feet faster.
And put your chest out.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.516
Like this.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.925
Try it.

19:58.764 --> 20:01.130
Move your feet faster.

21:22.981 --> 21:24.107
You need help?

21:24.549 --> 21:25.811
It's okay.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.217
Give it here.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.618
This isn't heavy.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.538
How long have you been here?

21:51.777 --> 21:53.642
Take a guess.

21:57.749 --> 21:59.410
8 years.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.123
Since primary school?

22:09.361 --> 22:11.727
I'm older than I look.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.325
Don't treat me like a child.

22:20.572 --> 22:25.339
Why do you eat
with one of your knees bent?

22:26.478 --> 22:27.843
Because it hurts.

22:27.979 --> 22:30.311
- Your knee?
- No.

22:30.749 --> 22:31.909
My lungs.

22:33.852 --> 22:38.516
It's about 40% functional,
which isn't too bad.

22:40.459 --> 22:45.522
But if I run,
I might drop dead.

22:45.664 --> 22:46.926
Me too.

22:47.065 --> 22:49.533
If I drink...

23:59.871 --> 24:01.338
Good.

24:01.973 --> 24:03.838
Mouth open wide.

24:03.975 --> 24:05.840
Laugh your lungs out.

24:05.977 --> 24:08.138
Disease will leave you.

24:10.148 --> 24:12.514
Heart disease, leave me!

24:12.651 --> 24:16.610
Irritable colon syndrome,
go away!

24:21.159 --> 24:23.423
Renal failure, leave!

24:24.162 --> 24:25.629
Cirrhosis, leave him!

24:25.764 --> 24:28.733
Louder!
Cirrhosis, leave him!

24:30.268 --> 24:32.031
Lung cancer, leave me!

24:37.075 --> 24:41.842
Let's welcome our new friend
with a song.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.312
Pair up, please.

24:46.151 --> 24:47.413
Okay.

24:49.754 --> 24:51.415
One, two, three, four.

24:51.556 --> 24:59.019
~ It's so nice to meet you.
It's so nice to meet you.

24:59.164 --> 25:02.827
~ Let's meet again.

25:02.968 --> 25:10.534
~ It's so nice to meet you.
It's so nice to meet you.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.940
~ Let's meet again.

25:14.479 --> 25:22.011
~ It's so nice to meet you.
It's so nice to meet you.

25:22.153 --> 25:25.520
~ Let's meet again.

25:41.072 --> 25:42.733
Thanks, Eun-hee.

25:47.979 --> 25:49.913
Here you go.

25:50.348 --> 25:51.508
Thanks.

25:55.153 --> 25:57.519
What's your blood type?

26:01.059 --> 26:02.424
O positive.

26:05.764 --> 26:07.925
I was O positive, too.

26:08.466 --> 26:10.832
What are you talking about?

26:11.570 --> 26:13.333
I thought it was O.

26:13.471 --> 26:17.032
After I got sick,
I learned that it's A positive.

26:17.475 --> 26:19.841
I was very cheerful

26:19.978 --> 26:23.141
But I've gotten timid
since I found out.

26:29.154 --> 26:30.519
Well...see you.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.034
Mr. Kim?

27:02.954 --> 27:06.117
You don't know
what you're talking about!

27:06.257 --> 27:09.021
You're a quack, aren't you?

27:09.160 --> 27:14.325
No wonder!
A quack at a shitty hospital!

27:14.466 --> 27:17.629
I did what I was told to
and took all the medicine.

27:17.769 --> 27:20.329
He doesn't know anything!

27:20.472 --> 27:22.440
He tells me...

27:23.575 --> 27:24.837
Wait.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.114
I did everything!

27:32.450 --> 27:33.815
Wait.

27:39.057 --> 27:41.321
Why didn't you eat?

27:50.869 --> 27:53.633
You smoked, didn't you?
Where are they?

27:53.772 --> 27:56.536
-I didn't.
-Don't lie. I can smell it.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.643
I smoke for 45 years.

27:59.377 --> 28:00.537
Get out of here.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.239
I can't share a room with you.
Get out!

28:03.348 --> 28:05.908
Out!
Get the hell out!

28:06.051 --> 28:08.110
What's wrong with you?!

28:11.156 --> 28:12.521
Damn it!

28:24.669 --> 28:27.035
Why did I ever smoke?

28:53.965 --> 28:55.330
What are you doing?

29:11.349 --> 29:13.613
You've had no visitors.

29:14.753 --> 29:15.913
I know.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.017
I'm an orphan.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.225
I'm sorry.

29:24.162 --> 29:27.029
My parents died
when I was little, too.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.829
We're in the same boat.

29:30.668 --> 29:35.537
Eun-hee, I was just joking.

29:45.049 --> 29:46.277
Eun-hee?

29:48.553 --> 29:49.815
I'm sorry.

29:50.655 --> 29:53.317
Don't joke about things
like that.

29:55.059 --> 29:56.720
Apologize to me.

29:58.363 --> 30:00.524
Okay, I apologize.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.529
Wanna give me a piggyback?

30:09.474 --> 30:10.634
What?

30:12.177 --> 30:13.735
No, forget it.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.914
I'll piggyback you.

30:23.555 --> 30:24.715
I mean it.

30:25.857 --> 30:27.119
It's okay.

30:33.464 --> 30:34.931
Take my word for it.

30:35.066 --> 30:36.624
No way.

30:36.768 --> 30:40.534
This is plantain, right?
Good for your liver.

30:41.172 --> 30:45.233
No, it's just weed.
Plantain has bigger leaves.

30:45.376 --> 30:48.436
See?
What'd I say?

30:49.280 --> 30:51.612
It's snack time!

31:03.461 --> 31:04.928
Thanks.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.131
Give me a cigarette.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.530
Come on.

31:13.671 --> 31:14.933
I mean it.

31:16.274 --> 31:19.141
I'll trade you with my radio.

31:29.854 --> 31:31.412
This is nice.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.740
You shouldn't smoke.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.242
What about you?

31:58.349 --> 32:01.614
I'd smoked for over 40 years.

32:03.655 --> 32:08.217
And I regretted it so much.

32:09.661 --> 32:12.630
Now I'm smoking not to regret.

32:15.366 --> 32:17.527
You know what I mean?

32:20.772 --> 32:22.034
I'm not sure.

33:04.349 --> 33:10.219
I'm dying. I hope you make it.
PS. The radio is for you.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.918
Help! Help!

34:21.059 --> 34:23.926
- What is it?
- He killed himself.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.324
Hurry! Quick!

34:51.755 --> 34:53.518
Go inside now.

34:54.458 --> 34:57.121
Go inside.
Aren't you cold?

34:57.261 --> 34:59.229
I'm hungry.

35:00.164 --> 35:02.530
When are we eating?

35:47.879 --> 35:49.437
Are you up?

36:35.159 --> 36:36.626
May I?

36:39.764 --> 36:41.732
I used to drink a lot.

36:56.747 --> 36:58.408
It tastes the same.

37:03.754 --> 37:05.415
You know what?

37:07.558 --> 37:09.423
You look perfectly normal.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.125
You don't look scared.

37:19.070 --> 37:21.334
Not hurt.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.543
And not sick.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.912
Cause nobody cares, I guess.

37:38.055 --> 37:41.115
I get really scared
even when I catch a cold.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.525
I'll show it from now on.

37:47.865 --> 37:49.628
And I expect you to care.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.527
Plantain.

38:26.671 --> 38:29.936
Thistle...
So hard to remember.

38:30.374 --> 38:34.640
- And?
- Dandelion, wild parsley, sedum.

38:35.079 --> 38:37.513
These herbs are good for you.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.913
Try to memorize them.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.119
Plantain...

38:51.462 --> 38:53.123
Check this out.

38:54.465 --> 38:55.932
What's that?

38:56.067 --> 38:59.036
- Mugwort?
- No!

39:28.065 --> 39:29.930
- Peel everything?
- Yes.

39:31.469 --> 39:32.936
This part, too.

39:35.873 --> 39:38.933
There won't be much left to eat.

39:39.577 --> 39:44.412
Why are you doing that?
It's disgusting.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.209
I washed my hands.

39:46.350 --> 39:49.808
It will taste better
if Eun-hee peels them.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.421
My disease isn't contagious.

39:51.555 --> 39:53.523
No, it's not.

39:53.657 --> 39:56.717
How do you know?
Have you touched him?

39:56.861 --> 39:59.523
- What?
- Cut it out.

40:01.565 --> 40:04.932
Oh, I forgot.
I have to go to the bank.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.437
Finish this for me, will you?

40:07.571 --> 40:08.629
Okay.

40:16.947 --> 40:18.414
Why are you leaving?

40:18.549 --> 40:19.811
You don't know?

40:20.251 --> 40:21.513
Cause I'm disgusting!

40:24.255 --> 40:26.917
Cirrhosis...what a lady's man!

40:57.555 --> 40:58.715
It's good.

41:12.169 --> 41:13.932
What's wrong?

41:14.972 --> 41:16.234
Nothing.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.243
Do you like it?

41:23.447 --> 41:24.414
Yes.

41:31.255 --> 41:32.415
Eun-hee...

41:33.057 --> 41:34.115
Yeah?

41:35.159 --> 41:37.423
Why didn't you eat earlier?

41:42.166 --> 41:43.531
Tell me.

41:45.769 --> 41:46.827
Come on.

41:49.373 --> 41:51.841
There was a roach in it.

41:57.648 --> 41:59.912
Why didn't you tell me?

42:04.154 --> 42:06.714
You looked so happy eating it.

42:13.063 --> 42:19.229
When a couple watches a movie
at a dark theater...

42:19.870 --> 42:22.134
They hold hands, right?

42:23.474 --> 42:25.942
I guess that's only in movies?

42:28.879 --> 42:34.215
Are you asking me
to hold your hand?

42:35.052 --> 42:38.419
At a deserted place like this...

42:38.556 --> 42:40.319
...a couple usually kisses.

42:53.971 --> 42:55.632
Hold on.

43:21.165 --> 43:26.034
Young-su,
what I have isn't contagious.

44:15.052 --> 44:16.519
Oh God!

44:17.855 --> 44:19.117
Damn.

44:19.256 --> 44:21.520
You scared me.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.024
Here.

44:25.663 --> 44:26.823
Thanks.

44:28.465 --> 44:30.729
You get scared easily.

44:35.372 --> 44:38.136
I've seen a ghost in this room.

44:40.277 --> 44:42.643
I have a knack for this kinda thing.

44:48.952 --> 44:50.317
Good night.

44:51.855 --> 44:55.313
Eun-hee?

44:56.360 --> 44:57.827
I'm scared.

44:59.063 --> 45:00.325
Eun-hee?

45:02.466 --> 45:04.127
Are you gone?

45:10.674 --> 45:12.539
Eun-hee?

45:21.051 --> 45:22.814
Still scared?

45:31.562 --> 45:33.530
Should I make you not?

45:34.565 --> 45:35.725
How?

45:39.770 --> 45:43.228
Wow, it's working.

46:33.757 --> 46:35.224
It tickles.

46:58.448 --> 46:59.710
Young-su?

47:02.553 --> 47:03.918
I'm out of breath.

47:04.555 --> 47:06.216
I might die.

47:38.155 --> 47:40.316
Young-su?

47:40.457 --> 47:41.822
Someone's here.

47:44.561 --> 47:45.721
What are we gonna do?

47:47.264 --> 47:49.425
Hide behind me.

47:55.272 --> 47:56.739
Okay.

47:58.075 --> 48:02.136
Hey, Cirrhosis.
Did you see Eun-hee?

48:02.880 --> 48:05.212
Yeah, last night.

48:05.849 --> 48:07.407
She's here, isn't she?

48:07.851 --> 48:09.409
Eun-hee?

48:09.753 --> 48:18.218
~ My heart is pounding,
and I don't know why.

48:18.362 --> 48:24.130
~ Maybe I'm in love.

48:38.949 --> 48:40.211
Aren't you hungry?

48:41.251 --> 48:42.718
You bet.

48:46.957 --> 48:48.322
Young-su...

48:49.159 --> 48:52.925
I used to date this guy.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.528
You're my first girl.

49:17.354 --> 49:18.514
Eun-hee?

49:19.356 --> 49:22.416
I told you not to get involved
with anybody here.

49:23.560 --> 49:26.324
You have neither
parents nor siblings.

49:26.863 --> 49:29.331
You're a patient.

49:29.967 --> 49:33.733
Another patient can't give you
help that you need.

49:35.772 --> 49:37.535
You like him that much?

49:40.077 --> 49:41.237
Yes.

49:43.347 --> 49:44.905
Did you cross the line?

49:51.655 --> 49:53.520
What will you do?

49:56.960 --> 49:58.825
Leave it to me.

50:02.366 --> 50:13.538
~ My heart is pounding,
and I don't know why.

50:14.878 --> 50:19.508
~ Whenever I see her.

50:20.350 --> 50:25.310
~ Whenever I see her.

50:25.856 --> 50:33.319
~ My heart is so full of hope.

50:33.463 --> 50:38.230
~ It might explode.

50:39.269 --> 50:41.635
~ Maybe...

50:42.873 --> 50:49.642
~ Maybe I'm in love.

50:53.550 --> 51:05.018
~ My heart is pounding,
and I don 't know why.

51:05.862 --> 51:09.923
- ~ Whenever I see her...
-Young-su?

51:11.468 --> 51:13.333
Let's move in together.

51:16.773 --> 51:18.331
Do you want to?

51:27.551 --> 51:29.917
We don't have to get married.

51:32.055 --> 51:37.015
I'm sick and might die soon.

51:41.264 --> 51:44.233
But I'll help you get better.

51:50.574 --> 51:53.042
If it doesn't work out...

51:54.478 --> 51:56.605
We'll break up then.

53:56.967 --> 53:58.025
Eun-hee?

54:36.473 --> 54:39.237
Look here and smile.

54:39.376 --> 54:41.742
One, two, three.

54:45.348 --> 54:47.111
Be happy, Eun-hee.

54:47.550 --> 54:48.710
Be well.

54:48.852 --> 54:50.410
Good luck, Eun-hee.

54:50.954 --> 54:53.821
Cirrhosis, be good to her.

54:53.957 --> 54:54.719
I will.

54:54.858 --> 54:57.224
You should cut down
on noodles.

54:58.261 --> 55:01.230
Raise some leek.
That's good for you.

55:01.865 --> 55:03.730
Bye, Eun-hee.

55:11.875 --> 55:14.036
- Take care!
- Bye.

55:16.846 --> 55:23.615
~...lost in deep thought.

55:25.055 --> 55:30.425
~ Through the window flows in

55:30.960 --> 55:34.521
~ the sound of children playing.

55:35.765 --> 55:41.328
~ Only if the sun continues to shine,

55:41.471 --> 55:45.134
~ I'll live under the sky and wind.

55:46.676 --> 55:51.807
~ Through the sound of rain and thunder,

55:51.948 --> 55:55.907
- ~ I'll dance and live freely.
- Hurry!

56:32.255 --> 56:35.816
Why do I wanna kiss you
when I'm kissing you?

56:38.762 --> 56:39.820
Eun-hee...

56:42.265 --> 56:43.926
You like me that much?

56:44.768 --> 56:47.828
Yes.
What about you?

56:55.278 --> 56:57.212
I guess so-called eternal love does exist.

57:02.051 --> 57:04.918
It does, Young-su.

57:06.656 --> 57:15.928
Daily Plans

57:23.773 --> 57:26.333
Young-su?

57:26.476 --> 57:27.636
Wake up.

57:28.978 --> 57:30.605
Come on.

57:33.750 --> 57:34.910
Drink this.

57:38.655 --> 57:39.815
Thanks.

57:47.964 --> 57:49.932
Come here.
Lie down with me.

57:50.066 --> 57:53.035
- What are You doing?
- Come on.

57:53.169 --> 57:56.627
- Get up now.
- Come here. Come on.
