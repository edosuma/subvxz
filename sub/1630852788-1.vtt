SHAN MAO AS HUIXIAN

02:04.250 --> 02:09.088
Master, the three young men are
still outside. It's already the fifth day.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.549
It's raining heavily.

02:11.674 --> 02:14.760
If they don't go,
they'll collapse from exhaustion.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.345
Yes, sir.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.939
Please ask the masters
to discuss the matter.

02:42.538 --> 02:43.664
ASSEMBLY HALL

03:05.728 --> 03:09.481
Those three fellows have come
for martial arts training.

03:09.607 --> 03:12.526
They've been kneeling outside
for five days,

03:12.651 --> 03:16.614
though we don't teach outsiders.

03:16.739 --> 03:22.036
They're determined,
and the rules can be changed.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.538
What do you think?

03:25.497 --> 03:29.043
No. The Abbot is still in his chambers.

03:29.168 --> 03:32.338
This concerns the Shaolin Temple's
reputation,

03:32.463 --> 03:34.381
so we ought to take the decision
carefully.

03:50.898 --> 03:54.652
You're getting weaker.
Maybe you should go back.

03:56.028 --> 04:00.282
I must train at the Shaolin Temple
in order to take revenge.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.535
I'll stay or die.

AS MANYUE

04:33.941 --> 04:40.906
Are all the masters aware that
we've been kneeling here for five days?

04:41.031 --> 04:46.161
Yes, they are aware of that.
They're discussing it now.

04:46.287 --> 04:50.374
A decision can't be made
until the Abbot is present.

05:10.853 --> 05:13.522
KU WEN-TSUNG
AS THE ABBOT

05:15.482 --> 05:17.026
Sister Wumei...

05:23.615 --> 05:28.454
You should meditate with me
in the temple.

05:28.579 --> 05:32.124
Because of your student Miao Cuihua,

05:32.249 --> 05:39.715
I'm dealing with Wudang,
hopefully to avoid a massacre.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.552
I understand your strategy.

05:43.677 --> 05:49.224
I'm afraid that Miao's son,
Fang Shiyu, won't give up.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.188
I've thought about that.

05:55.105 --> 06:00.903
Calamity is sure to occur.
The question is how to avert it.

06:01.028 --> 06:05.657
The Shaolin martial arts
must flow smoothly.

06:05.783 --> 06:12.039
They must be all-pervasive,
not stopping even during hard times.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.709
Now I should leave the chamber.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.597
The Abbot has left his chamber!

07:09.054 --> 07:12.224
Master, the three young men
are still here.

07:13.225 --> 07:16.228
I'm aware of that.

07:18.814 --> 07:24.653
I have thought about the future
of the temple while I was meditating.

07:24.778 --> 07:29.074
Learning martial arts is forbidden by law.

07:31.076 --> 07:37.249
The teaching of Shaolin Temple
martial arts must come to an end.

07:37.374 --> 07:41.336
Calamitous times will soon be upon us.

07:42.379 --> 07:46.383
I just realized, after the heavy rains,

07:46.508 --> 07:49.261
although there is great power
in our martial arts,

07:49.386 --> 07:53.515
it will be difficult to shield
against an attack by the government.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.019
In order to preserve
the Shaolin Temple martial arts,

07:57.144 --> 08:00.981
we must share our teachings
with people outside.

08:01.106 --> 08:05.235
That way, they will not be lost
over time.

08:05.777 --> 08:09.573
To ensure that our teachings continue,

08:09.698 --> 08:13.243
we must enroll more students
from the outside.

08:13.368 --> 08:17.831
Huixian, open the door of the temple,
and let the three young fellows in.

08:17.956 --> 08:23.629
Master, if we do this,
that means anyone can enter the temple.

08:23.754 --> 08:26.507
This sacred place will be ruined.

08:26.632 --> 08:30.719
We have no choice.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.072
Stand up.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.992
I won't stand
if you aren't going to accept me.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.620
Enter first, then we shall talk.

09:16.473 --> 09:20.852
Fang Shiyu, Hu Huiqian, Hong Xiguan...

09:22.646 --> 09:26.692
As students at the temple,
you must follow its rules.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.027
You can't leave
until you have learned everything.

09:29.152 --> 09:33.657
You have knelt outside for five days,
showing real determination.

09:33.782 --> 09:37.578
Having entered the temple, you must
cast aside your thirst for vengeance.

09:37.703 --> 09:40.747
Any infraction of the rules,
and you will be expelled.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.875
Manyue, take them
to the South Garden.

09:44.001 --> 09:45.335
Yes, sir.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.966
Come.

10:47.981 --> 10:52.361
Miss Yan Yongchun is an old friend.

10:53.362 --> 10:57.699
I arranged to meet her here.
She'll take us to a fishing village nearby.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.493
We'll eat there and rest.

10:59.618 --> 11:03.747
Yongchun,
these are my good brothers...

11:05.374 --> 11:08.627
Hu Dedi, Li Shikai,

11:08.752 --> 11:12.839
Fang Dahong, Ma Chaoxing, Ma Fuyi.

11:14.758 --> 11:18.387
We're the only ones left
of Lord Zheng's supporters.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.515
Hiding at Miss Yan's village
is fine for now.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.768
Where else would we find shelter
in this vast world?

11:24.893 --> 11:29.022
Lord Zheng sent us
to contact the Shaolin Temple.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.525
"Rebel against the Qing
and restore the Ming Dynasty."

11:31.650 --> 11:34.194
- We can seek shelter in Shaolin.
- I agree.

11:34.319 --> 11:38.532
I've heard the Shaolin Temple
is taking in outsiders.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.951
I don't think we'll be rejected.

11:48.291 --> 11:52.295
- Fuyi, don't you wish to go Shaolin?
- It's not like I have a choice.

11:53.338 --> 11:55.006
I'm just thinking...

11:55.132 --> 12:01.555
Those who joined the Qing Dynasty
are now rich and prospering.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.393
Ma Fuyi, what exactly are you saying?

12:07.602 --> 12:10.188
- What did I say?
- Hey!

12:10.313 --> 12:15.026
We're the only ones left
who can do this. No more arguing!

12:15.152 --> 12:18.113
Dedi, do you know
how to get to Shaolin?

12:18.238 --> 12:21.700
Going there is a good idea.
My teacher Wumei is cloistered there.

12:21.825 --> 12:25.829
- I can take you there.
- Let's head to the Shaolin Temple.

12:31.877 --> 12:33.545
MAHAVIRA HALL

12:37.007 --> 12:39.468
SHAOLIN TEMPLE

12:46.850 --> 12:51.188
We've been kneeling for three days,
and haven't seen a single monk!

12:51.313 --> 12:53.440
Lin Guangyao, I'm leaving.
This is ridiculous!

12:53.565 --> 12:56.359
I don't care
if they make us gods in there!

13:29.684 --> 13:32.562
It is no simple thing to gain entry
to the Shaolin Temple.

13:35.232 --> 13:37.901
- Master...
- You must kneel if you want to learn.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.070
Master, do you remember me?

13:40.195 --> 13:44.616
I met the Abbot when I was here.
I had journeyed from Taiwan last time.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.205
Please enter.

14:01.341 --> 14:05.303
- They can go in, why can't I?
- They're here to see the Abbot.

14:05.428 --> 14:09.099
We are too.
We want to be his students.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.643
Hey, look at him!

14:37.794 --> 14:41.131
After three days in the temple,
all we've become is cooks!

14:45.385 --> 14:50.015
Hey! Careful you don't fall in
and ruin the food!

16:22.607 --> 16:24.651
Aren't you hungry?

16:24.776 --> 16:29.781
My stomach's rumbling.
However, we mustn't eat this rice.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.033
Is it poisoned?

16:32.158 --> 16:36.871
They won't just let us in. This is a test
to see how determined we are.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.306
Please return to your homes.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.600
We came here to learn.
What's wrong with that?

16:57.726 --> 17:01.563
You need to withstand
many hardships to study here,

17:01.688 --> 17:04.315
way beyond just starving
for three days.

17:04.441 --> 17:10.280
If you can't even tolerate that,
then don't even talk about martial arts.

17:10.405 --> 17:15.869
Forget any ideas you may have
about entering the temple.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.926
You were right!

17:32.052 --> 17:35.638
I'm always wiser than you.

18:43.164 --> 18:47.127
You have studied
the Shaolin Ten-Style Fist Form,

18:47.252 --> 18:52.799
and the lethal techniques of
the Five Animal Styles for some time now.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.301
Show me the forms.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.835
Master...

19:30.336 --> 19:31.838
Master, sorry I'm late.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.217
Don't bother attending
if you're going to be late.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.344
Master, I won't do it again.

20:02.660 --> 20:06.164
Master, I've been here for a long time,
but I've learnt nothing.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.166
Please have mercy on me.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.044
Tiger style.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.736
Crane style.

20:58.967 --> 21:02.303
The two styles have many variations.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.348
You're not as studious as he is.

21:05.473 --> 21:09.269
That's enough for now.
Go and stoke the fire in kitchen.

21:09.394 --> 21:13.398
- I haven't got the forms yet.
- Each of us has different potential.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.817
If I ask you to stoke the fire,
you must do so.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.445
How can I learn both styles
by stoking fires?

21:19.570 --> 21:22.282
How do you know that you can't?

22:11.873 --> 22:14.792
- When did you enter the temple?
- Just recently.

22:14.917 --> 22:18.463
- How long did you wait outside?
- I didn't wait.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.598
Fang Shiyu!

22:30.808 --> 22:32.060
Fang Shiyu!

23:04.467 --> 23:06.010
Stop being so lazy.

23:06.135 --> 23:09.180
It's just making a fire.
Why does it have to be me?

23:16.813 --> 23:18.689
Tiger style.

24:15.163 --> 24:20.668
I would rather be killed
than humiliated.

24:21.919 --> 24:24.422
Please return to your homes.

24:44.609 --> 24:47.487
Master, they're Zheng Chenggong's men.

24:47.612 --> 24:51.240
They're wanted by the authorities
and they're not monks.

24:51.365 --> 24:54.660
If they remain here,
the government will soon notice.

24:57.371 --> 25:01.667
You mean, we should expel them
from the temple?

25:04.420 --> 25:06.714
Tell Zheng Chenggong's men

25:06.839 --> 25:10.426
to change into the robes
of the apprentice monks.

25:10.551 --> 25:15.681
- Yes, sir.
- How many people still seek entry?

25:15.806 --> 25:20.770
There are only three left.
They're very determined.

25:20.895 --> 25:25.274
I hope they really want to study.

25:44.001 --> 25:47.129
- Manyue, help them up.
- Yes, sir.

25:52.134 --> 25:55.680
Get away!
I'd rather die if they won't let me in!

25:57.598 --> 26:01.769
Lord Buddha,
please show them mercy.

26:15.366 --> 26:18.786
Hey, you're new here.
I'm Fang Shiyu.

26:21.330 --> 26:24.500
Huang Songhan, Lin Guangyao,
Zhu Du.

26:30.840 --> 26:36.053
- It seems you've suffered a lot.
- But, finally, my wish was fulfilled.

26:36.178 --> 26:39.890
You entered the temple, Brother Fang.
You must've learned a lot already.

26:40.016 --> 26:44.020
Well, that depends...
I've been stoking fires mostly.

26:58.367 --> 27:02.371
Lin Guangyao, Zhu Du,
you go to the library.

27:03.372 --> 27:07.084
Huang Songhan,
you go to the kitchen.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.504
Yes, sir.

27:14.091 --> 27:17.053
Good. You're my co-worker now.

27:17.178 --> 27:20.348
Learning how to be a good cook
isn't so bad.

27:21.015 --> 27:24.226
Can martial arts be learned
in the library?

27:28.981 --> 27:30.566
Who knows?

27:30.691 --> 27:33.903
We're inside Shaolin now,
it should be fine.

27:34.779 --> 27:38.157
You'd better get some sleep.
We have be up before dawn.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.993
You won't learn anything if you're late!

27:50.836 --> 27:52.880
LIBRARY OF SUTRAS

27:58.886 --> 28:03.057
Taking care of the library
is important work.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.269
Only one of you can be in charge.
I shall teach gymnastics to the other.

28:07.395 --> 28:10.523
Which of you would like
to take care of the library?

28:12.149 --> 28:16.320
Zhu Du, give me a chance.
I'll be grateful to you my whole life.

28:29.333 --> 28:35.005
You must open all the books,
and constantly turn the pages.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.341
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.843
- You follow me.
- Yes.

28:54.984 --> 28:58.696
Eh? Master, there's nothing
written in the book.

28:59.780 --> 29:02.908
It's a matter of whether
you can or cannot see.

29:44.742 --> 29:48.120
I observed you when you first arrived.

29:48.245 --> 29:52.500
- You show potential for gymnastics.
- Thank you, Master.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.755
Tie these to you.

30:00.758 --> 30:04.094
They weigh fifteen catties each,
totaling sixty catties of iron.

30:04.220 --> 30:07.306
Do not remove them until I say so.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.567
Jump.

31:06.824 --> 31:08.617
Do not stop jumping.

31:47.406 --> 31:51.035
Hey! Have you just been stoking fires
all this time?

31:51.160 --> 31:52.912
Not really.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.253
What are you doing?
Get on with the cooking!

32:01.378 --> 32:04.465
- Then get out of my way!
- Stop being so unreasonable!

32:04.590 --> 32:08.135
Nothing has any reason here.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.095
He's not learning anything either!

32:10.220 --> 32:12.306
Pay no attention to him.

32:12.431 --> 32:17.728
Keep stirring, or you'll be beaten
if the congee gets burnt.

32:22.858 --> 32:28.280
Has everyone here received a beating,
even the masters and the monks?

32:30.908 --> 32:35.579
Master, I'm having a rough time here,
can you please help me out?

32:37.790 --> 32:39.667
The congee is burning!

33:35.889 --> 33:38.726
Keep turning the pages, don't be lazy.

34:10.758 --> 34:12.676
Turn them!

34:43.373 --> 34:45.250
Keep jumping!

35:32.381 --> 35:35.342
Master, I won't be lazy again!

37:25.118 --> 37:29.122
- Hey!
- Don't help me. I won't be lazy again.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.685
Am I doing it right?

37:51.228 --> 37:54.856
Brother Hu, how do you do
the Crane style?

37:56.024 --> 37:59.403
You're asking me about martial arts?

37:59.528 --> 38:06.285
The Abbot knows our potential
and our strengths, you should ask him.

38:08.745 --> 38:11.790
I want to learn
the Tiger and Crane styles.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.959
Is it wrong to ask?

38:14.084 --> 38:17.337
The rule says that
we can't instruct each other.

38:19.131 --> 38:21.300
Call yourself a friend?

38:37.482 --> 38:43.196
Hu Dedi, Cai Dezhong, and the others
are training in the garden. Let's watch.

38:43.864 --> 38:45.198
Alright, let's go.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.369
I can't feel my legs anymore.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.413
Are you going?

38:53.165 --> 38:55.917
It's the same for me. Look...

38:59.004 --> 39:01.715
How come?
You're just drying out books.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.343
I still think we're all learning something.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.117
What are you doing here?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.369
Go!

40:12.494 --> 40:14.621
What are you doing?

40:14.746 --> 40:17.082
You want to train in the martial arts?

40:18.166 --> 40:19.668
I'll join you!

40:23.922 --> 40:28.969
- What's he doing?
- Brother Ma, this is the Tiger style.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.179
Don't underestimate it.

40:49.364 --> 40:50.824
Come on.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.018
Stop!

41:23.648 --> 41:25.775
We can do this again,
anytime you want.

41:28.612 --> 41:30.155
Definitely!

41:36.286 --> 41:42.459
I admit, Fang Shiyu can't beat you.
But someday, he might be your match.

41:42.584 --> 41:45.545
Good.
I shall look forward to that day.

42:41.059 --> 42:42.811
Just watch out!

42:45.855 --> 42:47.315
Let's go.

43:57.636 --> 44:01.806
Master, will you come and teach me
at this hour every night?

44:10.649 --> 44:14.110
Never mind him.
I'll be here anyway.

44:18.907 --> 44:21.826
Hey, I've almost mastered gymnastics.

44:39.969 --> 44:41.971
Where's Lin Guangyao?

44:42.097 --> 44:45.350
Maybe he left after he was through.

46:38.671 --> 46:40.173
Stand down!

47:06.199 --> 47:08.368
Your Highness.

47:10.453 --> 47:12.330
Your Honor.

47:16.042 --> 47:19.045
- General Qing, how are you?
- I'm well.

47:19.712 --> 47:23.132
It must be tough for you
in the Shaolin Temple.

47:24.259 --> 47:27.428
It's an honour to work
for the Emperor and yourself.

47:29.347 --> 47:32.392
The Emperor despises
the Shaolin Temple.

47:32.517 --> 47:37.105
I heard, since last year, they've been
admitting lots of outside students.

47:37.230 --> 47:39.899
The Emperor was most displeased
when he heard that.

47:40.024 --> 47:44.946
Yes, lots of outsiders have entered
the temple since last year.

47:45.071 --> 47:49.659
Even now, groups of ten or more
arrive every month.

47:50.493 --> 47:53.830
These outsiders, are they any good?

47:54.664 --> 47:58.751
The selection process is very strict.

48:00.086 --> 48:05.258
If I want to be rid of the Shaolin Temple,
what do you think I should do?

48:05.383 --> 48:10.263
I've considered this matter
for many years now.

48:10.388 --> 48:11.973
The Shaolin Temple is a strong base.

48:12.098 --> 48:18.688
We've taken over almost the whole world.
Why can't we defeat the Shaolin Temple?

48:19.147 --> 48:22.483
Assembling troops
is not a bad strategy,

48:22.609 --> 48:27.572
but maybe we should place our spies
amongst the apprentice monks.

48:27.697 --> 48:32.368
Also, we can use my status at the temple
to influence the cleverer ones.

48:32.493 --> 48:35.788
I think it'll be easier that way.

48:37.206 --> 48:39.500
You've been in Shaolin for a long time.

48:39.626 --> 48:42.712
I really long to see some
of the famed Shaolin martial arts.

48:44.005 --> 48:46.716
You wish to test my ability?

48:47.675 --> 48:49.552
I wouldn't dare.

49:10.031 --> 49:14.619
The Shaolin Temple martial arts
are indeed powerful.

49:14.744 --> 49:16.788
We have to thoroughly wipe them out!

49:17.330 --> 49:20.833
May I be excused?
Meet me when the time is right.

49:44.983 --> 49:46.067
Stop there!

49:56.869 --> 49:59.080
Don't bother chasing him.

49:59.205 --> 50:04.293
Even if you catch him,
you won't beat him.

50:04.419 --> 50:07.672
He'll kill you if he's cornered.

50:10.675 --> 50:12.510
May I ask who you are?

50:12.635 --> 50:17.015
You two were apprentice monks before?

50:17.140 --> 50:19.642
Yes, I'm Hu Dedi.

50:19.767 --> 50:22.854
This is my best friend,
Cai Dezhong.

50:24.313 --> 50:26.482
I'm Wumei.

50:29.152 --> 50:30.236
Master Wumei.

50:30.361 --> 50:36.409
The Abbot requested
that I train here at the temple

50:36.534 --> 50:38.995
until the time was right.

50:39.120 --> 50:43.374
Seeing you tonight is indeed a sign.

50:43.499 --> 50:47.378
What arts do you usually practise?

50:47.503 --> 50:51.466
I train in the three-sectioned staff.

50:51.591 --> 50:53.426
I practise the Way of the Fist.

50:55.094 --> 51:00.391
Then I shall instruct you
in the Fist and Whip Forms.

51:00.516 --> 51:07.482
But after you've learnt them,
you must work for me.

51:08.941 --> 51:10.777
Thank you, Master.

51:10.902 --> 51:13.488
What can we do for you?

51:13.613 --> 51:17.909
I have only had two female students
in my life,

51:18.034 --> 51:23.539
Miao Cuihua and Yan Yongchun.

51:24.415 --> 51:27.460
Miao has followed me
for a long time.

51:27.585 --> 51:32.715
Her husband was killed
by one of Wudang's men.

51:32.840 --> 51:36.803
They have a son, Fang Shiyu.

51:38.054 --> 51:40.223
I have heard he's presently
enrolled in the temple.

51:40.348 --> 51:41.182
That's right.

51:41.307 --> 51:44.060
The rules of the Shaolin Temple are strict.

51:44.185 --> 51:48.606
He's yearning to take revenge.

51:48.731 --> 51:52.110
If he disobeys the rules
of the Shaolin Temple,

51:52.235 --> 51:56.447
please offer him help.

51:56.572 --> 51:57.615
Yes, we shall.

51:57.740 --> 52:01.160
Yan Yongchun is my new student.

52:01.285 --> 52:08.084
Before I could begin teaching her,
I was summoned here to the temple.

52:08.209 --> 52:10.545
Yan Yongchun is my good friend.

52:10.670 --> 52:16.509
Good.
Calamitous times are approaching.

52:16.634 --> 52:21.556
Then, we shall see each other no more.

52:21.681 --> 52:24.142
After you leave the temple,

52:24.267 --> 52:29.272
you must teach this fist form
to Yan Yongchun.

52:29.814 --> 52:31.023
Yes, Master.

52:53.004 --> 52:57.216
<i>This fist form is designed
for women.</i>

52:57.341 --> 53:01.345
<i>It emphasises close attacks,</i>

53:01.470 --> 53:06.184
<i>attacking one's enemy
at very close range.</i>

53:06.309 --> 53:12.690
<i>Even fighting in an enclosed space,
it's clear who the winner will be.</i>

53:12.815 --> 53:19.989
<i>Once your enemy gets close,
you shall be unbeatable.</i>

53:44.764 --> 53:48.559
Zhu Du, I have something
to tell you. Come.

53:49.393 --> 53:50.478
Yes.

54:01.697 --> 54:04.450
Master, how can I get up there
without stairs?

54:04.575 --> 54:07.328
- Surely you can just jump.
- Jump?

54:10.539 --> 54:13.084
I don't know whether it's possible.

54:22.718 --> 54:24.262
Master, I...

54:25.805 --> 54:28.599
Your gymnastic skill has improved greatly.

54:28.724 --> 54:34.563
Keep practising till you leave
no marks on the paper.

54:34.689 --> 54:40.528
By using more force, you will easily
be able to jump to the roof.

54:42.238 --> 54:44.407
Come, let's go and see Lin Guangyao.

55:00.381 --> 55:03.175
Master, you mean I'm better than...

55:03.301 --> 55:06.971
He can't defeat you,
even without the irons.

55:07.096 --> 55:09.765
Winners don't win everything,

55:09.890 --> 55:13.352
Losers don't lose everything.
Understand?

55:14.770 --> 55:15.938
I understand.

55:25.990 --> 55:27.450
Crane style.

56:04.236 --> 56:06.364
I'll challenge Ma Fuyi again today.

56:06.489 --> 56:08.115
I'll definitely beat him this time.

56:08.240 --> 56:14.705
The shadow boxer last night showed me
the complete Tiger and Crane style.

56:15.706 --> 56:19.085
It's a shame I'll never know
which master he is.

56:22.838 --> 56:24.840
You're better than me.

56:24.965 --> 56:28.135
They're adding more irons to Lin's leg.

56:28.260 --> 56:32.681
Zhu Du is even better,
his jumping is getting higher.

56:32.807 --> 56:34.892
Not to mention Hu Huiqian's skills.

56:35.017 --> 56:37.228
You've learnt the Tiger and Crane style.

56:37.353 --> 56:38.896
As for me...

56:41.774 --> 56:44.693
...I've just been cooking
for a whole year

56:44.819 --> 56:46.695
and studied nothing.

56:49.532 --> 56:53.244
Even if I have behaved badly,
that's enough punishment.

57:22.523 --> 57:25.985
You're here again.
You're not afraid of being hit?

57:26.110 --> 57:28.863
How many times
have you been beaten?

57:29.822 --> 57:33.409
Not that many, only once a month.
Maybe seventeen or eighteen times.

57:33.534 --> 57:36.328
Very well,
one more beating tonight, then.

57:58.726 --> 58:00.519
I'll beat you again.

58:26.879 --> 58:28.839
Stop!

58:37.306 --> 58:38.766
Master.

58:40.392 --> 58:43.771
You are simply testing your skills,
so why are you hitting so hard?

58:43.896 --> 58:45.648
Hard? That's nothing.

58:47.358 --> 58:48.817
That's nothing?

58:54.073 --> 58:57.785
Yes, I was hit so many times
just like this.

58:57.910 --> 59:00.663
This is his first time.

59:01.747 --> 59:04.375
Fang Shiyu,
why do you misbehave so?

59:04.500 --> 59:05.960
Me, misbehave?

59:06.085 --> 59:10.256
Master, I fight him every month,
everyone knows that.

59:11.423 --> 59:16.053
If I see you fighting again,
you'll be beaten and expelled!

59:33.445 --> 59:34.905
Ma Fuyi...

59:37.616 --> 59:39.994
I've been observing you.

59:42.329 --> 59:44.331
- Follow me.
- Yes.

59:56.468 --> 59:59.597
That Ma Fuyi is a sly fellow.

1:00:00.764 --> 1:00:05.561
It's strange that Master Huixian
favours him so much.

1:00:06.478 --> 1:00:07.938
Master Huixian...?

1:00:23.037 --> 1:00:27.207
You said, in life,
we should follow the natural flow.

1:00:27.333 --> 1:00:29.627
Though Shaolin's foundation is strong,

1:00:29.752 --> 1:00:32.755
it will still be a challenge
to fight the Qing troops, right?

1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:34.340
Master...

1:00:35.507 --> 1:00:38.135
...there's something I need to say.

1:00:42.056 --> 1:00:46.185
I don't think you're used
to the life here at the temple.

1:00:46.310 --> 1:00:49.605
You aspire to a life of luxury, I think.

1:01:00.783 --> 1:01:02.785
Good. Good.

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:12.294
Luxury lies ahead of you,
only if you do what I say.

1:01:13.003 --> 1:01:14.713
Master...

1:01:16.423 --> 1:01:20.344
You must speak of this to no one.

1:01:29.978 --> 1:01:34.692
Come here whenever there's chance,
and I shall instruct you alone.

1:01:35.567 --> 1:01:37.152
Yes, sir.

1:02:20.821 --> 1:02:23.907
The last step is called Flying Dragon.

1:02:33.250 --> 1:02:37.463
Good.
Dezhong's fist form is now complete.

1:02:37.588 --> 1:02:43.719
I hope Yan Yongchun spreads its teaching,
after it's passed on to her.

1:02:48.724 --> 1:02:52.144
She's clever.
She won't disappoint you.

1:02:56.398 --> 1:03:00.027
They just told me
about Master Huixian and Ma Fuyi.

1:03:00.152 --> 1:03:04.656
- I would like some advice from you.
- You're just suspicious.

1:03:04.782 --> 1:03:09.203
I should refrain from saying too much.

1:03:09.912 --> 1:03:12.331
The Abbot perceives everything.

1:03:12.456 --> 1:03:16.293
Calamitous times cannot be avoided.

1:03:16.418 --> 1:03:21.089
Instead of fighting,
just follow the natural flow.

1:03:21.882 --> 1:03:25.177
Don't ask questions, listen well,

1:03:25.302 --> 1:03:30.057
and wait for the bad times to pass.

1:03:30.849 --> 1:03:35.604
Please take good care of yourselves.

1:03:36.563 --> 1:03:37.689
Yes.

1:03:59.878 --> 1:04:02.381
Huang Songhan,
come to the Abbot's room.

1:04:10.722 --> 1:04:15.894
Out of Lin, Zhu, and Huang,

1:04:16.019 --> 1:04:20.858
Huang has shown the most potential,

1:04:20.983 --> 1:04:25.070
but he lacks a sense of calm.

1:04:25.195 --> 1:04:29.283
Therefore, he needs to be trained
in the kitchen.

1:04:29.408 --> 1:04:31.827
Now, it's time.

1:04:31.952 --> 1:04:35.789
You should teach him
the Shaolin Staff Form.

1:04:35.914 --> 1:04:42.838
Even though you're the teacher now,
he may surpass you in the future.

1:04:42.963 --> 1:04:45.632
Master, you mean that I...

1:04:45.757 --> 1:04:50.012
The Shaolin staff is soft yet powerful.

1:04:50.971 --> 1:04:54.766
The difficulty lies
in getting the balance right.

1:04:54.892 --> 1:04:56.435
For the past two years,

1:04:56.560 --> 1:05:01.940
he has been stirring congee
with his staff, like drawing circles.

1:05:02.065 --> 1:05:06.028
You will find that his arm control
is exceptionally good.

1:05:14.119 --> 1:05:16.788
Master, finally, I understand.

1:05:18.415 --> 1:05:20.167
Catch!

1:06:23.146 --> 1:06:26.066
Why did you wake me up
at this hour?

1:06:28.860 --> 1:06:31.738
Have you forgotten why we're here?

1:06:31.863 --> 1:06:34.992
Never. I'm here to learn
the martial arts.

1:06:35.117 --> 1:06:37.744
You and I must take revenge.

1:06:38.704 --> 1:06:42.541
I think we've learnt enough
to attain that.

1:06:47.421 --> 1:06:52.843
I've mentioned about leaving,
but it seems the masters won't agree.

1:06:53.885 --> 1:06:56.430
- We'll have to...
- ...force our way out?

1:06:57.889 --> 1:07:01.476
Can we fight our way out
through Wooden Men Alley?

1:07:03.270 --> 1:07:07.566
I don't know. That's why I'm here
to talk to you about it.

1:07:08.608 --> 1:07:12.446
I've made up my mind.
We have to sneak out and take revenge.

1:07:13.905 --> 1:07:16.742
We can't let anyone know.

1:07:16.867 --> 1:07:22.122
Let's do it.
We'll fight our way out tomorrow.

1:07:24.249 --> 1:07:26.043
WOODEN MEN ALLEY

1:07:31.923 --> 1:07:35.719
Wooden Men Alley
seems harmless enough.

1:07:35.844 --> 1:07:39.931
- You'll know about it, once you're in.
- Very well, I'll try.

1:07:46.396 --> 1:07:49.107
Switch on the device.
I'll go and report them.

1:08:53.630 --> 1:08:56.800
- Who's in the alley?
- Fang Shiyu, Hu Huiqian.

1:09:23.535 --> 1:09:26.037
Someone's entered Wooden Men Alley.

1:09:34.921 --> 1:09:38.508
It must be those two in pursuit
of their vendetta who've entered the alley.

1:09:39.217 --> 1:09:40.594
Fang Shiyu...

1:09:42.846 --> 1:09:44.639
Let's go and see.

1:09:46.308 --> 1:09:47.767
Let's go.

1:09:59.529 --> 1:10:03.783
The device has been switched on.
It seems they haven't passed through yet.

1:10:06.036 --> 1:10:08.538
It's against the rules
to enter the alley by force.

1:10:08.663 --> 1:10:12.667
I want you to hide inside the alley
with Ma Fuyi. Show them no mercy.

1:10:12.792 --> 1:10:15.086
We must hold them here at all costs.

1:10:18.256 --> 1:10:23.678
This is the master's order. Don't hesitate.
Anyone who shows mercy is a traitor!

1:10:23.803 --> 1:10:25.013
Hurry!

1:10:25.639 --> 1:10:27.891
- Hide in the secret passage.
- Yes.

1:10:43.907 --> 1:10:45.992
Which way should we go?

1:10:48.536 --> 1:10:52.540
Well, we're here now.
Each of us can choose a path.

1:12:53.745 --> 1:13:00.502
THE PATH OF TURNING BACK

1:13:04.589 --> 1:13:10.970
- The Path of Turning Back?
- Turn back or you shall suffer greatly.

1:13:11.554 --> 1:13:17.018
Thank you for your advice,
but I am on a mission of vengeance.

1:13:17.811 --> 1:13:19.938
Lord Buddha, have mercy.

1:13:20.063 --> 1:13:25.110
Master, please counsel me.
What will happen inside the alley?

1:13:49.134 --> 1:13:51.094
Turn back!

1:14:04.482 --> 1:14:06.276
Fang Shiyu!

1:15:09.380 --> 1:15:11.382
Fang Shiyu, prepare yourself.

1:15:29.275 --> 1:15:31.569
Brother Ma, ask them to turn back.

1:15:32.403 --> 1:15:34.113
I want him to suffer.

1:15:34.239 --> 1:15:37.951
Master Huixian said that
it matters not if we kill him.

1:15:50.046 --> 1:15:52.423
Why aren't you helping me?

1:15:55.343 --> 1:15:56.803
Take that!

1:16:05.603 --> 1:16:07.730
Fang Shiyu, you deserve this!

1:16:28.960 --> 1:16:30.295
Watch out!

1:16:35.967 --> 1:16:37.844
Let's block him in at the entrance.

1:16:37.969 --> 1:16:41.639
Brother Ma, do you want to kill him
or are you just following orders?

1:16:41.764 --> 1:16:43.641
Don't talk nonsense!

1:17:05.997 --> 1:17:07.498
Master!

1:17:37.403 --> 1:17:39.781
- What's happening?
- Fang Shiyu and Hu Huiqian are inside.

1:17:39.906 --> 1:17:41.991
Then we must...

1:17:43.785 --> 1:17:45.787
Brother Li, Brother Fang,
Brother Ma,

1:17:45.912 --> 1:17:48.122
how about we enter and take a look?

1:17:49.874 --> 1:17:51.250
Very well.

1:18:06.015 --> 1:18:08.017
Master, please have mercy!

1:18:08.142 --> 1:18:10.311
Master, we seek your help...

1:18:13.231 --> 1:18:15.274
He tried to kill me.

1:18:15.400 --> 1:18:19.570
Entering the alley doesn't warrant death.
There's the Path of Turning Back.

1:18:19.696 --> 1:18:22.115
It's to give people a chance to retreat.

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:23.741
Silence!

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:33.584
You flout the rules of the temple!

1:18:39.132 --> 1:18:42.802
Master is powerful in martial arts,
so advise us, we want to help.

1:18:50.852 --> 1:18:52.437
Let's go.

1:19:03.406 --> 1:19:04.949
Come!

1:19:14.584 --> 1:19:17.128
Young Master,
I must leave the Shaolin Temple.

1:19:17.253 --> 1:19:19.255
Why have you brought me here?

1:19:19.922 --> 1:19:24.302
You can crawl through here,
close to exit of Wooden Men Alley.

1:19:27.388 --> 1:19:30.349
You're asking me to crawl
through a dog's hole?

1:19:30.475 --> 1:19:32.310
A great man should be flexible.

1:19:32.435 --> 1:19:36.773
Besides, there's something
not quite right about Huixian.

1:19:36.898 --> 1:19:39.400
You can't stay at the temple
any longer.

1:19:40.860 --> 1:19:42.945
Thank you for your help.

1:19:47.325 --> 1:19:49.911
- Hit me hard here with your fist.
- What for?

1:19:50.036 --> 1:19:52.121
I have a plan. Come on, quickly.

1:20:00.296 --> 1:20:01.672
Go!

1:20:02.882 --> 1:20:04.509
Hurry! Fast!

1:20:51.556 --> 1:20:54.600
Fang Shiyu, it's time for you to die!

1:20:54.725 --> 1:20:57.728
Even if you get past
the last eight wooden men,

1:20:57.854 --> 1:21:00.147
you won't get through me,
the final stage!

1:21:00.273 --> 1:21:01.941
You won't beat me!

1:21:06.404 --> 1:21:09.365
Brother Ma, he won't make it out.
How about stopping the device?

1:21:09.490 --> 1:21:14.537
No! Let him die in the alley
as a warning to others!

1:21:42.189 --> 1:21:43.733
Master, try me...

1:21:54.035 --> 1:21:55.912
Fang Shiyu, get out!

1:22:02.793 --> 1:22:06.714
- Go!
- Thanks for your help. Farewell!

1:22:33.032 --> 1:22:34.951
- I survived...
- Yes.

1:22:35.076 --> 1:22:37.954
- Where are we?
- We're outside the Shaolin Temple.

1:22:58.557 --> 1:22:59.767
HALL OF MORAL DISCIPLINE

1:23:00.810 --> 1:23:09.026
These men, besides Ma Fuyi,
all helped Fang and Hu to escape.

1:23:09.151 --> 1:23:12.530
They must be punished severely.

1:23:12.655 --> 1:23:15.282
Very well.
I agree with your judgement.

1:23:15.408 --> 1:23:16.575
Very well.

1:23:17.618 --> 1:23:20.287
Each of you shall face the wall
for three months.

1:23:43.144 --> 1:23:44.895
Hu Dedi.

1:23:54.989 --> 1:23:56.907
Cai Dezhong.

1:24:04.206 --> 1:24:06.167
Li Shikai.

1:24:10.046 --> 1:24:12.048
Fang Dahong.

1:24:16.093 --> 1:24:17.511
Ma Chaoxing.

1:24:20.431 --> 1:24:22.224
Zhu Du.

1:24:27.229 --> 1:24:28.355
Huang Songhan.

1:24:28.481 --> 1:24:31.567
I thought Master Huixian
was just training...

1:24:31.692 --> 1:24:33.819
If you complain, you'll get six months!

1:24:46.165 --> 1:24:48.501
- Manyue is also one of them.
- No, I'm not.

1:24:48.626 --> 1:24:51.045
I took Hu Huiqian to see the Abbot,

1:24:51.170 --> 1:24:53.839
but he was powerful and very skillful.

1:24:53.964 --> 1:24:57.384
He beat me and then ran away.

1:24:58.677 --> 1:25:00.638
It really hurts.

1:25:01.639 --> 1:25:05.309
Manyue, a monk must never lie.

1:25:05.434 --> 1:25:07.311
But I didn't lie.

1:25:07.937 --> 1:25:12.858
You made a misjudgement.
Sweep the library floor for three months!

1:25:12.983 --> 1:25:14.985
Thank you, Master.

1:25:33.546 --> 1:25:36.507
Young Master,
it's been almost three months.

1:25:37.633 --> 1:25:39.760
And I've been bored to death.

1:25:39.885 --> 1:25:41.887
They're all still
on their punishment detail.

1:25:42.012 --> 1:25:46.642
It's a good thing the newcomers told us
what Hu and Fang did in Guangzhou.

1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:55.109
Young Master, hurry.
Get a rope and pull me out.

1:25:57.319 --> 1:26:01.407
You don't need a rope.
You'll be free if you feel no burden.

1:26:01.532 --> 1:26:04.451
What burden am I carrying?

1:26:05.494 --> 1:26:08.998
You forget, you could hardly walk
when you arrived here.

1:26:11.709 --> 1:26:15.045
Master, can I take off the irons?

1:27:01.133 --> 1:27:02.635
Excellent.

1:27:24.323 --> 1:27:28.160
It's you, Huang Songhan.
It must've been tough on you.

1:27:28.285 --> 1:27:30.996
Get me out.
I can't stand this place any longer.

1:27:31.121 --> 1:27:33.874
I'm here to tell you that
all your suffering will pay off.

1:27:34.875 --> 1:27:36.585
What's happening?

1:27:37.670 --> 1:27:40.881
Fang Shiyu made it to his hometown
and killed his enemy Lei Laohu.

1:27:41.006 --> 1:27:44.009
Hu Huixian is in Guangzhou.

1:27:44.134 --> 1:27:46.804
He's a highly skilled fighter.

1:27:52.768 --> 1:27:55.187
You should go,
someone might come any time.

1:27:55.312 --> 1:27:57.982
Tomorrow is our last day anyway.
Let's speak then.

1:27:58.565 --> 1:28:00.359
Very well. Till then.

1:28:44.528 --> 1:28:46.030
Your Highness.

1:28:47.614 --> 1:28:52.619
Everyone present is one of "us".
You may speak freely.

1:28:53.704 --> 1:28:55.205
Yes, sir.

1:28:55.331 --> 1:28:59.001
The Emperor has given me
the army of the Blue Banner,

1:28:59.126 --> 1:29:02.463
and General Dechang's best artillery.

1:29:03.255 --> 1:29:08.594
If we fail to destroy the Shaolin Temple,
I shall lose face and can never return.

1:29:08.719 --> 1:29:12.348
The monks will sacrifice themselves
to defend the temple.

1:29:12.473 --> 1:29:14.683
But they won't be able to last that long.

1:29:14.808 --> 1:29:20.105
Our army is as fast as lightning.
They won't stand a chance.

1:29:22.149 --> 1:29:25.110
We will open the gates
once the army assembles.

1:29:25.235 --> 1:29:28.322
The army posted at the front gates
will be led

1:29:28.447 --> 1:29:32.326
by Lord Gu, Lord Qing
and General Dechang.

1:29:32.451 --> 1:29:34.703
That way, power can be focused.

1:29:36.246 --> 1:29:43.253
I'll secretly poison the monks,
then they'll be too weak to retaliate.

1:29:48.217 --> 1:29:53.013
Upon completion of our plan,
you'll be appointed as General.

1:29:54.264 --> 1:29:55.974
Thank you, Your Highness.

1:29:59.436 --> 1:30:02.898
No word of this to anyone,

1:30:03.023 --> 1:30:06.568
so that the Shaolin Temple
will be unprepared.

1:30:06.693 --> 1:30:08.570
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir!

1:30:52.698 --> 1:30:54.491
What's the matter?

1:30:56.952 --> 1:31:01.206
You remember seeing a masked fellow
the other night, outside Huixian's room?

1:31:01.331 --> 1:31:05.711
I just saw him again. It looked like
he put something in the well.

1:31:08.380 --> 1:31:11.258
- Could it be poison?
- I couldn't see that clearly.

1:31:12.134 --> 1:31:15.637
Was it Master Huixian?
I need to inform the Abbot.

1:31:16.305 --> 1:31:19.224
Master Huixian is a senior of the temple.

1:31:19.349 --> 1:31:22.978
How can we inform the Abbot
of our suspicions?

1:31:23.103 --> 1:31:24.396
Well...

1:31:28.150 --> 1:31:32.154
Just alert our close brothers,
so everybody can watch out.

1:31:34.072 --> 1:31:37.159
- What happened?
- Come over here...

1:32:05.646 --> 1:32:09.149
They were soldiers of the Qing Army.

1:32:09.274 --> 1:32:12.903
- I wonder where they're heading.
- Let's corner one and ask him.

1:32:32.714 --> 1:32:35.634
- Where are the troops heading?
- You traitors!

1:32:36.426 --> 1:32:39.555
Look at me, I'm just a citizen.

1:32:46.853 --> 1:32:49.314
We're heading to the Shaolin Temple.

1:32:52.693 --> 1:32:54.987
You liar! That's not true.

1:32:55.112 --> 1:32:58.615
You haven't even been punished,
and you have the nerve to return here?

1:32:58.740 --> 1:33:00.325
Master, it's true.

1:33:00.450 --> 1:33:02.619
Four thousand soldiers
of the Blue Banner

1:33:02.744 --> 1:33:05.956
are being led by Prince Mangui
to destroy the Shaolin Temple.

1:33:06.081 --> 1:33:08.792
The Qing army is assembled
at the foot of the mountain.

1:33:08.917 --> 1:33:11.044
I'm afraid they're going to attack.

1:33:12.671 --> 1:33:15.674
I know that destruction is inevitable.

1:33:16.592 --> 1:33:21.096
I hope I have at least half a day,

1:33:21.221 --> 1:33:25.309
so the spirit of the temple
can be maintained.

1:33:25.434 --> 1:33:28.395
Master, you must evacuate everyone.

1:33:29.146 --> 1:33:30.772
Silence!

1:33:30.897 --> 1:33:32.858
Master, one more thing...

1:33:32.983 --> 1:33:36.653
On our way here, we questioned
one of the soldiers.

1:33:36.778 --> 1:33:41.033
We heard that they had spies
here at the Shaolin Temple.

1:34:30.540 --> 1:34:31.917
What are you doing?

1:34:32.042 --> 1:34:34.002
You are the spy!

1:35:42.195 --> 1:35:43.530
Run, quickly!

1:36:01.214 --> 1:36:03.967
I'm going in.
Come after you finish with him.

1:36:04.092 --> 1:36:05.510
Of course.

1:36:56.853 --> 1:36:58.230
Master!

1:37:03.026 --> 1:37:05.862
The army has got in, we...

1:37:07.072 --> 1:37:11.827
We were poisoned by the traitors.

1:37:11.952 --> 1:37:16.289
We've lost our power.
We depend on you.

1:37:16.414 --> 1:37:20.585
Be sure to promote the martial arts
of the Shaolin Temple.

1:37:20.710 --> 1:37:24.047
Spread our teachings
throughout the country.

1:37:24.172 --> 1:37:27.717
I have decided I shall die here.

1:37:37.394 --> 1:37:39.354
Master!

1:37:39.479 --> 1:37:41.565
Master! Master!

1:39:40.433 --> 1:39:43.311
I've made my decision.
You escape, go on!

1:39:54.823 --> 1:39:58.702
The Shaolin Temple is finished.
Surrender or die.

1:39:59.869 --> 1:40:02.664
Otherwise, you'll end up
like this monk.

1:40:14.426 --> 1:40:17.137
Have they surrendered?

1:40:17.262 --> 1:40:20.557
- So, you're the traitor.
- You poisoned us!

1:40:20.682 --> 1:40:23.268
Master, let's get rid
of this final obstacle.

1:41:51.981 --> 1:41:53.733
Go!

1:42:30.687 --> 1:42:33.064
- Get the artillery here.
- Yes, sir!

1:43:23.990 --> 1:43:27.869
Ma Fuyi is the traitor!
Don't let him escape!

1:43:40.506 --> 1:43:42.008
Catch him!

1:47:06.421 --> 1:47:08.714
Stay calm,
and we can fight our way out!

1:50:50.144 --> 1:50:53.731
The General is trapped.
Get the archers here.

1:50:53.856 --> 1:50:55.107
Yes, sir.

1:52:30.119 --> 1:52:31.662
After them!

1:55:08.777 --> 1:55:11.405
- How heavy are you?
- About 120 catties.

1:55:14.533 --> 1:55:16.952
- Only eight irons, then.
- What do you mean?

1:55:18.954 --> 1:55:22.166
If I have to die here,
then I'm taking you with me!

1:55:57.201 --> 1:55:59.495
Launch the fire arrows!

1:56:00.329 --> 1:56:01.789
Move!

1:58:17.841 --> 1:58:19.218
SHAOLIN TEMPLE

1:58:19.885 --> 1:58:21.136
Run!

1:58:33.398 --> 1:58:35.317
The Shaolin Temple is finished.

1:58:38.946 --> 1:58:40.989
But its martial arts will live on.

1:58:48.914 --> 1:58:52.543
Our plan is to return to our hometown,
east of Guangdong.

1:58:52.668 --> 1:58:54.795
We will contact any survivors.

1:58:54.920 --> 1:58:57.756
We'll go north and make preparations

1:58:57.881 --> 1:59:00.467
for our next strategy
to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.

1:59:05.055 --> 1:59:06.557
Go!
