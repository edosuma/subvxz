WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:04.372
Okay. All right, hurry,
stack the cool ones.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.974
Hurry up!

00:07.041 --> 00:10.078
The church bake sale
isn't until tomorrow morning.
Why are we rushing?

00:10.144 --> 00:11.412
'Cause these are
fresh cookies,

00:11.479 --> 00:13.447
and my dad
will be home soon.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.583
They're not safe.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.119
Oh. Got it.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.453
(DOOR CLOSES)
Oh, crap! He's home.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.189
Hide the cookies!
Hide the cookies!

00:23.091 --> 00:24.392
KEVIN: Hello, hello?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.061
Hey.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.696
Hey.
Hey.

00:29.830 --> 00:30.931
How's it going?

00:30.998 --> 00:32.666
Good.
I just got the car washed.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.268
They're jacking the prices up
over there again.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.536
I'm not even gonna go.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.611
Something happened here.

00:45.513 --> 00:46.814
No, nothing.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.082
Really?

00:50.084 --> 00:53.087
It's still warm.
Interesting.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.094
That's sugar.

01:00.161 --> 01:02.130
Granulated cane.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.866
It's curious.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.102
It's probably nothing,
so...

01:16.043 --> 01:18.412
Mr. Gable, no.
You, no!

01:20.714 --> 01:22.250
They're for
the church bake sale.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.817
Can you please
leave them alone?

01:23.884 --> 01:25.886
And I would've,
if he didn't
try to deceive me.

01:25.953 --> 01:28.422
Something you may want
to bring up in confession
when you explain

01:28.489 --> 01:30.324
why there weren't enough
cookies at the bake sale.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.126
Let's go. Come on.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.761
Fine. I made extras anyway.
I'll put them
in the cookie jar.

01:35.729 --> 01:36.797
(SIGHS)

01:37.831 --> 01:41.669
Oh, uh, Dad, where's...
Where's Mr. Hoot?

01:41.735 --> 01:42.736
Mr. who?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.538
You know, the little
owl cookie jar.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.140
It's always
been right there.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.776
Oh. I sold it
at our garage sale
six months ago.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.144
Actually, to Goody.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.879
What? That's been
in the family for years.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.282
I know. It was old, you know?
It was missing an eye.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.684
It looked like it...
It got hit in the head
with a paint can.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.186
It's, like, donk.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.422
I loved that thing.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.424
I mean, don't you remember
when I was 8 years old

02:03.491 --> 02:05.559
and I wrote my initials
under the lid?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.795
I can't believe
you got rid of it.

02:07.861 --> 02:11.299
Mom wanted me to have it
for my kids someday.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.234
I'm sorry, sweetie.
I didn't know.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.935
Look, I'll...
I'll just call Goody.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.370
I'll get it...
I'll get it back, all right?

02:16.437 --> 02:18.172
Thank you.
It means a lot to me.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.007
Well, you know what
means a lot to me?

02:20.073 --> 02:21.475
They're for the church.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.943
Yeah, I either buy 'em Sunday
or I buy 'em now.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.445
All right?
Doesn't matter.

02:24.512 --> 02:29.250
* I am not your
ordinary guy *

02:29.317 --> 02:31.185
(DOOR CLOSES)
VANESSA: Hello?

02:31.252 --> 02:32.520
Hey.
We're in here.

02:33.254 --> 02:35.656
Hey. Lemme guess.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.191
You didn't fill out
the paperwork

02:37.258 --> 02:38.759
like you promised
you would.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.594
Aw, that's right.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.463
I'm... I can't believe
I did that.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.365
I'm sorry.
I totally forgot.

02:44.432 --> 02:45.666
Yeah,
very typical of you.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.768
Yeah, I think you should
take it back.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.671
(SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

02:50.738 --> 02:52.740
I just wanted to see you
get all hopped up, all right?

02:52.806 --> 02:54.342
See,
that's the problem with you.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.210
You always underestimate me.
And look at me.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.878
I got things covered.
I'm on top of it.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.481
Hey.
Oh, hey, Goody,

03:00.548 --> 03:02.115
did you bring the owl?

03:02.182 --> 03:04.117
So, Didi reminded me
that we gave it

03:04.184 --> 03:05.919
to my cousin
as a wedding gift.

03:05.986 --> 03:10.491
Wait. You gave a $5 cookie jar
as a wedding gift?
It was used.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.959
That's why I rinsed it.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.094
It was missing an eye.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.397
That's why I wrapped it.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.598
All right, well,
can you call your cousin

03:17.665 --> 03:18.932
and have him
send it to us?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.668
'Cause it's...
It's important to Kendra.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.237
I would, but he doesn't
have it anymore.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.606
He sold it to a pawnshop
in Utica.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.642
He pawned a used,
one-eyed cookie jar?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.177
I don't have to explain
my family to you.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.247
Wow. It's like that.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.783
(SCOFFS)
But I got good news.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.185
I called the pawnshop,
and they still have it.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.420
That's great.
Let's get it shipped.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.888
Well, I tried,
but they don't ship.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.257
Why not?
'Cause it's not
Williams Sonoma.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.693
It's a pawnshop in Utica.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.829
All right.
I guess I'm driving upstate.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.499
Dad, are you sure? I mean,
that's like a four-hour ride.
Yeah.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.667
Look, if it's important
to you, I'm going.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.436
Aww.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.871
It is important to you, right?
Yes, it is.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.773
Okay.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.110
And they definitely
don't ship?
They don't ship.

04:03.176 --> 04:04.945
And it's definitely
important to you?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.080
CHALE: Um, I hate to be
the voice of reason here,

04:07.147 --> 04:09.483
but, uh, isn't it a bit silly
sending your father

04:09.550 --> 04:11.285
all the way upstate
for a cookie jar?

04:11.352 --> 04:12.820
Why is it silly?

04:12.886 --> 04:16.690
Because I just found them
online for less than $10.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.293
Sending your father up there
is a little bit crazy.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.661
So now I'm crazy?

04:20.728 --> 04:22.162
Oh, boy.
Well, what is it?

04:22.229 --> 04:23.731
Am I silly,
or am I crazy?

04:24.231 --> 04:25.366
Calm down.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.834
Calm down?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.802
I'm out.
KEVIN: All right,
we got to go.

04:31.339 --> 04:34.575
(IMITATING CHALE)
"I hate to be
the voice of reason here."

04:34.642 --> 04:36.677
(NORMAL VOICE)
You are one dumb man.

04:36.744 --> 04:38.646
What was I supposed to do?

04:38.712 --> 04:40.314
She was being unreasonable.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.682
Okay, well, you don't say
"calm down"

04:41.749 --> 04:43.050
when they give you
that look.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.352
It's like running into
a bear in the woods.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.719
You play dead.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.588
I thought you were
supposed to get big

04:47.655 --> 04:49.089
and jingle your keys
and yell,

04:49.156 --> 04:50.223
"Bear, bear,
there's a bear!"

04:50.290 --> 04:51.725
No.

04:52.460 --> 04:53.894
That's for a grizzly.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.863
Or is it a black bear?
I don't know.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.532
I don't know.
One you play dead,
the other you get big.

04:58.599 --> 05:02.536
Then you got koalas
and pandas. I think
you can just hug them.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.072
I guess I still have
a lot to learn about marriage.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.008
But we do have a four-hour
car journey ahead of us.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.611
Maybe you can impart
a little more wisdom.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.312
Oh. That's actually
a good idea.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.314
(LAUGHS)
Or...

05:14.382 --> 05:16.283
(RADIO TURNS ON)
LOU ON RADIO: How ya doin'?
Lou from Staten Island.

05:16.350 --> 05:19.520
Listen, I think the Mets
are having a fantastic year.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.456
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

05:22.523 --> 05:24.492
Hey.
Hi.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.926
Can you do me a favor?
Yeah.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.095
When your dad gets home,
could you have him

05:28.161 --> 05:29.763
re-sign
where the tabs are,

05:29.830 --> 05:32.933
and tell him this time
not to get jelly on it?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.234
Yeah, see, getting food

05:34.301 --> 05:35.903
all over important paperwork
is kind of his thing.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.971
My birth certificate
still has Cheeto dust on it.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.272
(LAUGHS)

05:39.339 --> 05:41.742
KYLE: Hey, Kendra, is, uh,
my duct tape out there?

05:41.809 --> 05:42.976
Oh, uh, no.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.878
No, I don't see it.
Your Uncle Kyle's here?

05:44.945 --> 05:47.047
Yeah, he's fixing
our furnace.
Oh, okay, I'm gonna run,

05:47.114 --> 05:48.782
'cause every time he sees me,
he hits on me.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.418
Which is weird
'cause he sucks in his gut,

05:50.484 --> 05:52.119
so he can only talk
in these short bursts.
(LAUGHS)

05:52.185 --> 05:53.286
I'll see you later.
Okay, bye.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.623
Tape was in my bag.
(LAUGHING) Hey.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.058
How you doing, girl?
(CLEARS THROAT)

05:58.125 --> 05:59.226
Take a breath, idiot.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.761
I'm breathing.
Okay.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.129
(STRAINED) Maybe we can go see
a movie or something?

06:02.195 --> 06:03.531
(CLEARS THROAT)

06:03.597 --> 06:05.098
Look, Kyle,
like I told you yesterday

06:05.165 --> 06:07.935
and pretty much every day
before that,

06:08.001 --> 06:10.270
this is not happening, okay?
This is a no-go.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.372
Okay, sorry.
You know, I just...

06:12.440 --> 06:14.007
You're the...
You're the whole package.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.544
Okay, uh, thank you.
That is very sweet.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.146
But come on, Kyle.
You're a nice guy.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.914
I'm sure there are
plenty of women

06:20.981 --> 06:22.916
out there for you.
Yeah, well, you'd think.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.519
But, you know, I hit
a little bit of a dry patch,
that's all.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.955
Around, uh, about '97.

06:28.021 --> 06:28.922
Oh.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.691
Well, what about
online dating?

06:30.758 --> 06:34.061
Nah. Tried 'em all.
Except for FarmersOnly.com.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.129
They sniffed me out
pretty quick.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.297
Maybe it's your profile.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.132
No, no.
Profile's rock solid.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.370
"Part-time cage-fighter."

06:43.437 --> 06:45.939
"The inventor
of the airline pillow."

06:46.006 --> 06:48.576
No, no, no.
I said I was on the team

06:48.642 --> 06:50.210
that invented
the airline pillow.

06:50.277 --> 06:51.545
Okay, Uncle Kyle,

06:51.612 --> 06:53.180
maybe you should
just redo your profile,

06:53.246 --> 06:54.682
and this time,
don't lie so much.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.250
Yes, I'm sure there are
a lot of things about you

06:57.317 --> 06:59.052
that women find attractive.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.353
Like what?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.556
Me? Oh, okay. Um...

07:04.391 --> 07:05.826
Well,
you're a firefighter,

07:05.893 --> 07:07.628
which means you have
great dental coverage.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.196
Yeah, a very good plan.
Dr. Weisman. Yeah.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.198
See?
But, you know,
everybody exaggerates

07:11.264 --> 07:12.566
on the dating profiles.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.867
Well, yeah,
but not everybody won

07:13.934 --> 07:16.870
the 2016 Pan American
Jiu-Jitsu Competition.

07:20.340 --> 07:22.075
This place is wild.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.277
Look, tomorrow night,
they have
an arm wrestling tournament

07:24.344 --> 07:26.046
and "Taco Madness." Fun!

07:26.113 --> 07:28.081
Okay, Chale,
you got to stop it, all right?
It's not fun.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.650
You know... You know what
fun would have been?

07:29.717 --> 07:31.218
Getting to the pawnshop
before it closed,

07:31.284 --> 07:33.386
getting our owl,
and driving home, okay,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.022
instead of staying
in a motel

07:35.088 --> 07:37.157
next to a burned-down
Panda Express.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.028
Once again,
I apologize, Mr. Gable.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.631
I set my GPS to scenic,
because I thought we could

07:43.697 --> 07:45.298
take in all
of the fall foliage,

07:45.365 --> 07:47.535
which, please admit it,
it was spectacular.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.637
(IMITATING CHALE)
It wasn't spectacular.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.305
(NORMAL VOICE)
It's a bunch of leaves.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.507
By the way, we got
a whole bunch in our lawn.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.175
Feel free to rake 'em up.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.646
Nice job. All right.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.147
'Scuse me, ma'am.
Oh!

08:00.213 --> 08:03.316
You're gonna want to keep
your hands to yourself!

08:03.383 --> 08:04.985
Sorry, I just...
I was just getting a napkin.

08:05.052 --> 08:06.520
Oh, I know what
you're trying to get.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.656
Look,
I am seeing someone, okay?

08:08.722 --> 08:10.958
Promise ring. Bam!
You see that? Uh-huh.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.793
Chunky, why are your eyes
down here?

08:12.860 --> 08:14.895
They're supposed
to be up here.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.897
I was just following
where your finger
was pointing.

08:16.964 --> 08:20.200
I know you're not talking
all sexy about my finger now.

Wait. What? What? What?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.336
Clyde!
Clyde?

08:23.403 --> 08:26.073
There a problem?
It's not a problem,
Clyde, all right.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.275
Listen, I'm gonna pay our tab
and we'll get out of here.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.810
Huh.
Yeah, all right.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.612
Mm-hmm. He was making
unwanted advances.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.780
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.814
Uh, I think
what we have here

08:33.881 --> 08:35.649
is a classic comedy
of errors.

You see,
we're from out of town.

You sound funny.

I'm from England.
And to me, you sound funny.

Wait. We sound funny?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.559
Huh.
Did you hear that,

08:45.626 --> 08:47.060
Yeah. Did you hear
what he called you?

08:47.127 --> 08:48.762
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no. I didn't
call him anything.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.030
Yeah, but you wanted to.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.933

I have to leave now.

Yeah, yeah.
But before you go,

Right in your face!

09:03.243 --> 09:05.178

09:05.245 --> 09:07.648
I changed my profile,
went fully honest,

09:07.715 --> 09:09.583

of the night.

She's cute.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.557
Yeah, it's been
less than a day,

09:17.625 --> 09:20.127
but I think we're
talking soul mate.

You haven't even met her yet.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.698

out there.

all right?

Honest Kyle,
off the market.

in the Kelly basket.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.139

09:34.507 --> 09:36.009
Aww. Wow.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.577
I can't believe
he found someone.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.713
He didn't.
That's a fake profile.

The picture of Kelly
is of my hairdresser.

No.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.589
Technically, yes.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.892
But only because I felt bad
about yesterday,

09:51.959 --> 09:53.593
and I just wanted
to build up his confidence.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.995
He won't even look
at another woman

09:55.062 --> 09:56.529
if he thinks he has
a shot on this one.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.666
Okay, you know what?
You're right.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.701
I will have Kelly
let him down easy.

nice about it.

Um, I maybe think...

18:05.718 --> 18:07.787
(STAMMERING) Or just,
uh, maybe a photograph

18:07.854 --> 18:10.757
of, uh, Mr. Grammer
enjoying a cookie
from the jar,

18:10.823 --> 18:13.860
perhaps a-a snickerdoodle
on the set of Cheers?

18:13.926 --> 18:15.428
I don't have any of that.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.598
Oh, well, then you don't
have any of this.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.936
I have the initials.
(SCOFFS)

18:24.003 --> 18:28.575
Yvette, those initials
were written
by an 8-year-old girl

18:28.641 --> 18:31.144
called Kendra Gable.
My wife.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.214
You're married to
an 8-year-old girl?
That's sick.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.217
No. I'm...
She's not eight now.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.487
Look, Clyde
said it was real.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.522
And I'm guessing
he also told you

18:42.589 --> 18:44.624
that diamond on that ring
is real?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.360
It is real.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.696
Isn't it?
Oh, Yvette.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.600
(LAUGHS) We got it!

18:53.666 --> 18:56.303
That's it! That's amazing.
How'd you do it?

18:56.369 --> 18:58.538
I bluffed,
and she blinked.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.373
That... I didn't think
you were gonna...
It's incredible.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.908
I know. I know.
I feel fantastic.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.311
Kendra's gonna be
so proud of me
when she finds out.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.978
It's not just Kendra, man.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.347
(STAMMERING)
I got to tell you,
I'm proud of you, too.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.048
I really am.
You know what?

19:09.115 --> 19:11.184
In fact, bring it in.
You got to bring it in.
Come on.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.852
Oh.
That was awesome. Yeah.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.154
(GRUNTS) Ahh!

19:15.622 --> 19:16.789
(LAUGHS)

19:16.856 --> 19:18.325
(ENGINE STARTS)

19:49.422 --> 19:51.858
I think maybe the hug
disoriented me and I...

19:51.924 --> 19:54.461
(RADIO TURNS ON)
MAN ON RADIO: Coming up next,
we'll have Knicks Coach

19:54.527 --> 19:57.564
Jeff Hornacek calling in
for an exclusive one-on-one...

20:01.167 --> 20:04.003
Hey.
Hey, did you guys get it?

20:04.070 --> 20:05.372
What happened
to your eye?

20:05.438 --> 20:08.040
I'm afraid we've got
some bad news.

20:08.107 --> 20:11.478
There was a gas leak
at the pawnshop.
The whole place blew.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.315
What?
Are you kidding me?

20:15.382 --> 20:17.083
That's how
this baby happened.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.918
I took a brick
to the face.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.456
The owl was
lost in the rubble.
It's just a mess.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.991
We're gonna get
a couple brews.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.827
Yeah,
we're pretty shaken.
Yeah.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.397
Yeah, I mean, who cares
about the stupid owl?

20:30.463 --> 20:32.399
I'm just... I'm glad
you guys are okay.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.766
Yeah,
we're getting there.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.101
Couple Heinekens
ought to take care of it.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.604
Couple of Heinis.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.838
You don't believe that story,
do you?

20:38.905 --> 20:40.840
Not a word.
That's his go-to.

20:40.907 --> 20:44.010
When Jack was 6,
my dad told him
the tooth fairy blew up.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.346
Well, technically, her car,
but, you know, she was in it.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.680
(SCOFFS)

20:51.250 --> 20:52.585
(DOOR CLOSES)
KYLE: Vanessa,

20:52.652 --> 20:54.020
met your hairdresser.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.659
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:59.726 --> 21:03.195
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

21:03.262 --> 21:05.432
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:05.498 --> 21:07.133
* Do, do, do, do

21:07.199 --> 21:10.603
* Oh, yeah

21:10.670 --> 21:13.673
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes

21:13.740 --> 21:16.309
* I just don't want no...
