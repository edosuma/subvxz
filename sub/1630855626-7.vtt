WEBVTT

00:14.389 --> 00:16.960
You are one sexy muchacho.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.894
<i>♪ Some people call you ♪</i>

00:18.993 --> 00:20.263
- Gordon!

00:20.362 --> 00:22.598
- I need your help.
- I hit a blood vessel.

00:22.691 --> 00:25.201
Listen,
I was here last night
for the Nightwing's Dead party,

00:25.299 --> 00:26.735
and I saw another Harley.

00:26.834 --> 00:29.138
I gotta know
if I'm losing my fucking mind.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.207
So, can you please check
the security cameras now?

00:31.305 --> 00:33.209
You know, I thought I saw
my doppelganger once,

00:33.307 --> 00:37.280
but it was just
a plate of <i>carne asada</i>
and nachos atop a trash can.

00:37.379 --> 00:39.148
- Who the hell is this?
- Get ready for some cuteness.

00:39.246 --> 00:42.518
<i>Okay?
Give Daddy his gun back now.</i>

00:42.618 --> 00:43.719
<i>Come on.</i>

00:43.818 --> 00:45.922
<i>Hey! This is my--</i>

00:46.019 --> 00:49.358
- You find what you need?
- Hey, where is the rest
of the footage?

00:49.456 --> 00:51.961
I got some bathroom stuff,
some make-out stuff.

00:52.060 --> 00:53.162
The rest,
I kind of taped over.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.631
So fucking worthless!

00:55.730 --> 00:57.166
When I'm looking
for something--

00:57.265 --> 00:58.634
I need to know
what's happening to me.

00:58.733 --> 01:01.304
Gordon, do I seem insane
to you?

01:01.402 --> 01:03.039
Um... No. You seem good.

01:09.977 --> 01:12.715
Obviously, guys,
I've been owning
the game, lately.

01:12.814 --> 01:16.152
Fucking owning it,
and all the haters
along the way.

01:16.251 --> 01:18.254
But we don't want to
have owned it.

01:18.347 --> 01:22.058
We want to always be, present
tense, owning it. Right?

01:22.156 --> 01:24.928
ABOI.
Always be owning it.

01:25.025 --> 01:27.330
No, no, no.
That sounds like BO
in the middle.

01:27.429 --> 01:28.797
Not everything
needs to be a thing.

01:28.896 --> 01:31.067
Anyway, the Legion
of Super-Heroes' time-sphere

01:31.165 --> 01:33.970
is being moved
to the Smithsonian
at 3:00 p.m.

01:34.068 --> 01:35.671
And we are gonna hijack it.

01:35.771 --> 01:37.606
Sick! A time-sphere.

01:37.705 --> 01:41.105
I'm gonna visit past atrocities
and learn how to do 'em better.

01:41.204 --> 01:42.878
I'd love to go back
and tell my younger self

01:42.977 --> 01:46.082
that snake-eye contacts
are more weird
than intimidating.

01:46.181 --> 01:48.317
I can go back in time
and do extra work

01:48.416 --> 01:50.086
without missing any work.

01:50.184 --> 01:52.221
Okay, guys, we're not
going to actually use
the time-sphere.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.822
- I just want it

01:53.921 --> 01:55.224
'cause it's like
gonna look really cute
on my wall.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.993
Total power move.

01:57.092 --> 01:59.095
Everyone, shut up! I have news.

01:59.194 --> 02:00.829
I'm starving.

02:00.929 --> 02:02.565
What are we doing for lunch?

02:02.663 --> 02:05.168
Volcana,
don't you dare say you're
"fine with anything" again.

02:05.267 --> 02:06.435
I'd rather have
a bad suggestion

02:06.534 --> 02:08.237
like all the ones Tefe gives.

02:08.335 --> 02:10.940
-  Hey!
- Okay, screw you.
I'm ordering gyros.

02:11.038 --> 02:13.977
Oh, and they moved up
the time-sphere transfer
to, like, right now.

02:14.075 --> 02:15.844
Oh, shit. We gotta go.

02:15.943 --> 02:19.282
Wait. I'm not paying
the delivery fee myself.

02:19.380 --> 02:23.319
Batgirl, I need to have a very
one-sided conversation
about my mental state.

02:23.419 --> 02:24.587
So, could you...

02:24.686 --> 02:26.489
-  Hello!
- Sorry, what?

02:26.587 --> 02:28.391
I can't hear anything
with my headphones on.

02:28.489 --> 02:30.593
They're for busy girls
in loud places. See?

02:30.691 --> 02:32.328
So, um, I just wanna, like,
talk about last night.

02:32.427 --> 02:33.963
Weird. You didn't bring this up
two hours ago

02:34.062 --> 02:35.664
when you brought me
half an egg sandwich.

02:35.763 --> 02:37.266
I did?
I don't remember doing that

02:37.365 --> 02:38.734
or eating half
of an egg sandwich.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.336
Oh, my God.
I'm really losing it?

02:40.435 --> 02:41.905
Okay. Well, there's nothing
to talk about.

02:42.002 --> 02:44.473
I had a nice cold shower,
and I'm totally good now.

02:44.567 --> 02:46.842
Okay. Well, cool.
But I am not totally good.
I'm more--

02:46.942 --> 02:48.344
I don't think
Joker murdered Nightwing.

02:48.442 --> 02:50.346
- What?
- It doesn't add up.

02:50.444 --> 02:52.681
If Joker really did it,
why would he wait
an entire day to tell everyone?

02:52.780 --> 02:55.218
Oh, my God. You're right.
He is the worst
at keeping secrets.

02:55.317 --> 02:56.652
I mean, he always
tells the kids

02:56.750 --> 02:58.387
where the <i>afikomen</i>
is hidden at Passover.

02:58.486 --> 03:00.723
We gotta prove Joker's lying
or no one will believe us

03:00.821 --> 03:02.591
when we find
the actual murderer.

03:02.691 --> 03:04.427
Whoa! You look like do-do.

03:04.525 --> 03:06.562
Right! That's, kind of,
what I was hoping
to talk to you about.

03:06.655 --> 03:08.697
Okay, sorry.
But I can't be the friend
you need right now.

03:08.796 --> 03:11.167
I owe it to Nightwing
to find the real killer.

03:11.265 --> 03:12.468
Can't you talk to Ivy?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.170
I'm trying to respect
her boundaries

03:14.269 --> 03:15.538
and not to bother her
with this stuff.

03:15.637 --> 03:16.839
Because, you know,
she's been so busy with--

03:16.938 --> 03:18.541
Awesome. You're the best.
Thank you.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.808
Please close the door.

03:22.610 --> 03:24.981
Good to have you
back in the poker game.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.415
An evil game!

03:26.514 --> 03:28.451
Killing Nightwing,
ooh, very tight.

03:28.550 --> 03:30.453
Moral politics was fun.

03:30.551 --> 03:32.721
But you can't change
the soul of a villain.

03:32.820 --> 03:35.458
So quotable, you're going
to slay on my podcast.

03:35.556 --> 03:37.793
- Excuse me. James Corden.

03:37.892 --> 03:39.996
Don't cover the phone.
I know Corden.

03:40.094 --> 03:44.133
Oh, you want me
to host one of your little
musical-comedy traffic jams?

03:44.232 --> 03:46.802
Co-host. Hmm?

03:46.901 --> 03:49.805
Yeah, sharing isn't really
my thing.

03:49.903 --> 03:52.208
Little shit is trying
to leech off my comeback.

03:52.307 --> 03:53.676
God, he's a needy motherfucker.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.079
Oh, it's my deal.
Gotta go.

03:56.177 --> 03:58.447
Bye bye.

04:00.143 --> 04:01.784
It's good to be back, boys.

04:01.884 --> 04:03.586
House always wins.

04:14.429 --> 04:15.764
I knew it!

04:15.863 --> 04:17.833
Way to trust your gut.
Barbara Gordon Junior.

04:20.101 --> 04:21.670
- Hey, babe, um--
- Hey.

04:21.769 --> 04:23.072
What the fuck's
with the red wig?

04:23.171 --> 04:25.141
Oh, I'm expecting the IRS
sometime this week.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.475
Gotta throw them
off their game.

04:26.574 --> 04:27.843
Okay? Whatever.
I need to talk to Ivy.

04:27.943 --> 04:29.273
Sorry. She left.

04:29.377 --> 04:31.147
- She had a hard-out
at quarter to.
- Quarter to what?

04:31.246 --> 04:32.881
That's privileged information.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.650
This is important.

04:34.749 --> 04:37.153
What about
a 4:00 a.m. hallway
walk-and-talk on Tuesday?

04:37.251 --> 04:41.357
Okay. Yeah, sure. 4:00 a.m.
is the perfect time to have
a coherent conversation.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.226
- Oh, sorry.
I just lost that time.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.961
What about 5:00 a.m?

04:45.058 --> 04:46.795
- Just FYI, she'll have
a hard-out at 5:15.

04:46.894 --> 04:51.295
Stop saying hard-out
and tell me where
Ivy is right now!

05:09.584 --> 05:11.254
Where is she?

05:11.353 --> 05:13.689
Really?

05:15.123 --> 05:16.960
I had a UTI at Jazzapajizza.

05:17.059 --> 05:17.994
This is nothing.

05:26.267 --> 05:27.770
Ivy!

05:30.672 --> 05:31.975
Oh, we love a power fem.

05:40.348 --> 05:42.785
 Time to go
green, bitch.

05:49.090 --> 05:50.893
Fetch, doggy!

05:50.986 --> 05:55.398
No one gets in the way
of me owning the game.

05:55.497 --> 05:56.632
Hey.

05:56.730 --> 05:58.567
Harley, what are you
doing here?

05:58.667 --> 06:00.069
I'm working right now.

06:00.168 --> 06:02.071
I know. Listen.
I tried to make an appointment,

06:02.169 --> 06:03.367
but all you had open
was 5:00 in the morning
next Tuesday.

06:03.472 --> 06:04.640
So, um...

06:06.641 --> 06:09.212
Did Nora say that
I had a hard-out at 5:15?

06:09.311 --> 06:11.580
- Listen, I need to talk to you.
- Harley, come on.

06:11.678 --> 06:15.884
Oh, man.
People don't just show up at
their partner's work like this.

06:17.151 --> 06:18.854
Yeah, Harley.

06:18.953 --> 06:21.424
Imagine if
the Supreme Court justice
got Frenched on the bench.

06:23.090 --> 06:24.928
I would not have come
if it wasn't super important.

06:25.025 --> 06:27.163
Can we just
talk about this later?

06:27.261 --> 06:28.697
I don't think we can.

06:30.965 --> 06:35.038
Baby, are you trying to stop me
from stealing the time-sphere?

06:35.135 --> 06:37.706
Geez!
There's a time-ball
on this truck?

06:37.805 --> 06:40.509
Yes, I am a big-deal
super villain.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.379
And sometimes I steal
time-spheres. Okay?

06:43.478 --> 06:45.381
ABST. Always be stealing--

06:45.480 --> 06:47.216
Enough with
the fucking acronyms.

06:47.314 --> 06:49.986
Baby, I'm doing all of this
because I'm building something.

06:50.083 --> 06:52.455
So, when we're, like,
60 years old
and still hot,

06:52.553 --> 06:56.859
we can sip wine
in our chateau and have
plenty of time to talk.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.727
Fine! If you won't
make time for me now,

06:58.826 --> 07:01.697
I will go find 60-year-old Ivy
and talk to her.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.099
Wait, what?

07:11.239 --> 07:12.976
Harley, what are you doing?

07:13.073 --> 07:16.612
Fuck! She is in no state
to be messing with
the time-space continuum.

07:16.711 --> 07:17.846
- BRB.

07:17.946 --> 07:20.216
Her acronyms
are so much cooler.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.018
Hey, baby. Baby, look at me.

07:22.116 --> 07:24.620
You do not know how to operate
a fucking time-sphere.

07:24.719 --> 07:26.622
- It's intuitive.
- What?

07:29.490 --> 07:31.494
Ugh, drama.

07:36.865 --> 07:37.934
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

07:39.167 --> 07:40.503
Oh, cake dick.

07:40.601 --> 07:43.172
- Damn it.
- What year did you take us to?

07:43.271 --> 07:44.640
Hmm? Interesting.

07:44.739 --> 07:46.342
It may not have been
as intuitive as I thought,

07:46.435 --> 07:48.611
which honestly is on
the time-sphere.

07:48.709 --> 07:50.474
What? Hey, Harley.
Where are you going?

07:50.578 --> 07:52.681
We gotta get back
to our time. Okay?

07:52.780 --> 07:54.550
Oh, what? Sorry.
Do you have a hard-out?

07:54.650 --> 07:56.152
No, I don't.

07:56.251 --> 07:58.421
I... At least I...
I don't think so.
Let me check.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.956
You know what?
There's no service.

08:00.054 --> 08:00.789
Fuckin' A.

08:00.889 --> 08:02.058
Argh! We shouldn't be here.

08:02.157 --> 08:03.960
This looks like a
goddamn apocalypse.

08:04.059 --> 08:05.194
Well, guess what?

08:05.293 --> 08:07.463
There's an apocalypse
happening in my brain.

08:07.561 --> 08:10.099
The emotional chickens
came home and
they are roasting, Ivy.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.269
Hey, shh. Let's not bring out
whatever cursed beings--

08:13.368 --> 08:15.704
Cluck-cluck, Ivy.
The chickens are fucking--

08:20.575 --> 08:21.945
Harley, get back
in the time-sphere.

08:36.357 --> 08:38.027
Argh! Ground-people!

08:40.428 --> 08:41.764
Shit!

08:52.639 --> 08:56.779
Hey, is someone gonna tell us
what in the future-fuck
is going on?

08:56.878 --> 08:58.915
Sure. We only had two men left.

08:59.013 --> 09:01.284
And your dumb ass murdered
the hot one.

09:01.383 --> 09:03.252
Now we just have Steve.

09:03.351 --> 09:04.921
Oh, fuck you, Kaya.

09:05.020 --> 09:07.256
Good luck
repopulating the Earth now.

09:07.355 --> 09:08.992
I'm not in the mood.

09:09.089 --> 09:11.094
You have ten seconds
to explain yourselves.

09:11.192 --> 09:13.796
Oh, and what
an honor to meet you.

09:13.889 --> 09:16.699
My daddy spoke
so highly of you both.

09:16.798 --> 09:17.700
I'm sorry. Do we know you?

09:17.799 --> 09:19.235
Ten seconds.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.703
Okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I'm terrible at brevity.

09:20.802 --> 09:22.138
Okay. So, I hijacked
a time-sphere

09:22.237 --> 09:24.340
because I'm, kind of,
going through some shit.

09:24.438 --> 09:25.874
And I thought I'd grab
my lady here and travel
25 years in the future,

09:25.974 --> 09:27.571
where I could meet
our older, wiser selves.

09:27.675 --> 09:29.512
And they could, like, you know,
give us the straight poop

09:29.611 --> 09:31.080
on how to live our best lives.

09:31.178 --> 09:33.049
But I must have set it
to the year 3,000 or whatever.

09:35.816 --> 09:37.921
It's 2048. But we all mess up.

09:38.020 --> 09:40.856
Yesterday I wrote 2047
on a check.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.558
So, I got it right.

09:42.657 --> 09:44.360
- See, it was intuitive.
- Harley.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.729
Okay, fine.
You can apologize to me
when we get back home.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.731
So, where's future me
and future Ivy, huh?

09:48.830 --> 09:51.534
Wait, wait. Don't tell me.
We operate a bed and breakfast
in Tuscany.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.598
No, no, no. We own and operate
a bed and breakfast in Tuscany.

09:54.703 --> 09:55.939
No, wait! It's a chain.

09:56.037 --> 09:57.773
It's a chain
which we no longer operate

09:57.871 --> 09:59.943
because we're selling
to a Belgian hospitality
conglomerate, hmm?

10:00.041 --> 10:01.644
Hate to burst your bubble,

10:01.744 --> 10:05.214
but you two are D-E-A-D dead.

10:05.307 --> 10:09.218
You're pretty much looking at
what's left of humanity
and shark-manity.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.220
Yeah. I'm just
gonna need, like,
a little more context.

10:11.319 --> 10:14.590
In the year 2024,
our world went dark.

10:14.689 --> 10:18.794
<i>Crops died, the soil was toxic,
global economies collapsed.</i>

10:18.891 --> 10:24.067
<i>Gotham became a police state,
ruled by the last remaining
member of the Bat Family,</i>

10:24.166 --> 10:26.002
<i>Robin.</i>

10:26.101 --> 10:28.972
<i>And yet a small
resistance movement</i>

10:29.071 --> 10:31.407
<i>has managed
to survive underground,</i>

10:31.506 --> 10:33.176
<i>led by our general,</i>

10:33.274 --> 10:36.712
<i>said to be the chosen one
who will lead us to a victory</i>

10:36.811 --> 10:39.582
<i>over Robin's drone army.</i>

10:39.681 --> 10:44.520
Wow. That was, like, really
dramatic and engaging.
Great stuff.

10:44.618 --> 10:47.651
Oh, thank you. I was actually
a voice-over artist
before the world ended.

10:47.755 --> 10:49.025
Oh,
a face for radio.

10:49.123 --> 10:51.655
So, sorry for...
For killing the hot guy.

10:51.759 --> 10:54.658
But all we really want to do
is just get back
to the time-sphere.

10:54.762 --> 10:56.699
Oh,
we'll help you
get the time-sphere.

10:56.797 --> 11:00.664
And you'll help the resistance
take down Robin
once and for all.

11:00.769 --> 11:02.005
Um, why?

11:02.104 --> 11:05.741
Because you're my moms.

11:07.403 --> 11:08.877
- Holy...
- Shit!

11:10.645 --> 11:12.781
Oh, my God. She's gorgeous.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.050
Wait, do we breastfeed you?

11:14.149 --> 11:16.085
Who did it?
Who's the sperm donor?

11:16.183 --> 11:17.853
I hate that I'm meeting you
all tied up and emotionally
at rock bottom.

11:17.952 --> 11:19.722
Are you crazy like me
or vegan like Ivy?

11:19.820 --> 11:21.290
What did we
name you?

11:21.390 --> 11:22.858
Neytiri.

11:25.126 --> 11:27.030
Like the blue chick
from <i>Avatar.</i>

11:27.127 --> 11:29.732
You know, for five years
I thought I dreamed that movie

11:29.825 --> 11:31.867
because I was so high
when we watched it.

11:34.101 --> 11:37.406
The <i>Avatar</i> film franchise
is widely considered
the greatest story ever told.

11:37.505 --> 11:40.409
It's nearly impossible
to quantify its impact
on our culture.

11:40.508 --> 11:43.346
- I see you, General Neytiri.
- And I see you.

11:43.445 --> 11:45.781
There is no way
we named her that.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.918
And that's when I realized
my crowbar wasn't
going to be enough.

11:49.016 --> 11:52.821
So, I took out my knife
and I began peeling
his silky skin

11:52.921 --> 11:54.718
from his perfect
bone structure.

11:54.822 --> 11:57.526
Well, my bone
is painfully hard right now.
So, how does this end?

11:57.625 --> 12:01.797
With me on the short list
for keynote-speaker
at next year's MALCon.

12:01.897 --> 12:03.532
It's between me
and Amy Schumer.

12:03.632 --> 12:04.867
God, you're a narcissist.

12:04.966 --> 12:06.669
I meant how did it end
with Nightwing?

12:06.762 --> 12:09.338
Oh, you know.
Tears and pleas for help.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.007
Natch!

12:11.106 --> 12:13.342
Bradley in San Diego
wants to know

12:13.441 --> 12:15.945
what were Nightwing's
last words?

12:16.044 --> 12:17.546
All right. Spill the tea.

12:17.645 --> 12:19.782
- What? Rita,
are you seeing this?

12:19.880 --> 12:22.418
<i>Joker,
Gotham deserves the truth.</i>

12:22.516 --> 12:24.420
Batgirl! Is that you?

12:24.519 --> 12:28.357
<i>No, this is...
Madame Justice.</i>

12:28.456 --> 12:29.892
<i>Doesn't matter.
Roll the clip!</i>

12:29.991 --> 12:30.994
What clip?
We don't have a clip.

12:31.092 --> 12:32.595
Rita, we got a clip?

12:32.693 --> 12:33.796
<i>Hold on a second.
It's loading. It's loading.</i>

12:35.063 --> 12:37.433
<i>Behold justice.</i>

12:39.501 --> 12:42.171
What the...
What the hell
am I looking at here?

12:42.270 --> 12:44.640
Is this one of those
hidden-cam porn things?

12:44.737 --> 12:47.276
<i>This footage clearly shows
on night in question,</i>

12:47.375 --> 12:49.312
<i>Joker was getting tested
for sleep apnea</i>

12:49.410 --> 12:51.514
<i>and thus could not
have killed Nightwing.</i>

12:51.614 --> 12:52.815
<i>Madame Justice out.</i>

12:52.915 --> 12:54.683
Oh, come on.

12:54.783 --> 12:56.185
You aren't buying this, right?

12:56.284 --> 12:58.387
That's obviously a deep fake.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.023
Listen, shit-face.

13:00.120 --> 13:03.392
The only thing my fans hate
more than women in power
is stolen valor.

13:03.492 --> 13:04.860
No! No, I didn't.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.729
And look at all the comments.

13:06.828 --> 13:11.334
"Wow, I didn't have
Joker's stolen valor
on my 2023 bingo card.

13:11.434 --> 13:13.202
LOL. Flop!"

13:13.301 --> 13:16.339
"Joker sucks.
Also, the Earth is flat."

13:16.437 --> 13:21.510
We just broke
400,000 sets of ears!

13:21.609 --> 13:23.947
- Bam, sucker!
-  I did it.

13:24.045 --> 13:25.714
I killed Nightwing.

13:25.814 --> 13:28.484
Me, the clown prince of crime.

13:28.584 --> 13:29.885
You're over, Joker.

13:29.984 --> 13:34.423
There's no coming back
from this.

13:34.521 --> 13:36.325
- Speaking of backs,
mine's never felt better,

13:36.424 --> 13:38.694
thanks to my new
Cleggpedic mattress.

13:38.794 --> 13:40.563
This isn't over.

13:40.661 --> 13:44.500
You can't quash my comeback.

13:44.592 --> 13:47.831
Listen up, team. We will be
entering the Robin's nest
through the sub-basement,

13:47.930 --> 13:49.572
where a recon team
has found a weakness.

13:49.671 --> 13:51.074
I mean, shit on a stick.

13:51.173 --> 13:54.110
Our kid is the leader
of the free world.

13:54.209 --> 13:56.312
I mean, no, duh. Right?

13:56.411 --> 13:58.948
King Baby has hacked
five captured bat-mech suits

13:59.046 --> 14:02.318
which Resistance Team one
will be using
to ascend the tower.

14:02.416 --> 14:05.989
Aw, look. She does the little
lip-bite thing you do
when you're really focused.

14:06.087 --> 14:07.523
I love being a mom.

14:07.623 --> 14:08.757
This is, like, the best.

14:08.856 --> 14:11.194
Oh, we're so
proud of you, baby.

14:11.292 --> 14:13.562
Yeah. You're doing it, girl.

14:13.662 --> 14:14.858
You get it, get it.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.534
- Cobb-squad assemble.

14:18.634 --> 14:20.036
I mean, I just got chills.

14:20.135 --> 14:21.470
Look... Look at my arm.
Look at my arm.

14:21.570 --> 14:22.571
Goosebumps.

14:28.710 --> 14:31.814
No, you have to put the nails
up to the fill line,
then the rocks.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.983
Uh-huh. Okay.

14:35.649 --> 14:38.021
Look at this.
She's, like, teaching us.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.223
Wait, wait.
Or did we teach you this?

14:40.855 --> 14:42.091
Yeah, totally.

14:42.190 --> 14:44.760
- Wow.
- Parenting is so rewarding.

14:44.860 --> 14:46.495
I know you'll have to go back,

14:46.594 --> 14:50.499
but even this little
time together just means
everything to me.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.635
Is it too much,
if I asked for a hug?

14:52.734 --> 14:53.898
Aw!

14:55.904 --> 14:58.741
Love you.
Oh, I do. I love you.

15:22.429 --> 15:25.930
Okay. Is it just me,
or is all this
a little too easy?

15:29.371 --> 15:30.473
Look out!

15:32.107 --> 15:34.543
Argh!

15:34.642 --> 15:37.746
You know what? I think
it's just our incredible
daughter's work ethic,

15:37.846 --> 15:39.348
which she gets from me,

15:39.447 --> 15:42.185
and the incomprehensible
confidence that she gets
from you.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.487
Watch out!

15:50.958 --> 15:54.497
Thanks, King Baby. You know,
your dad was the only villain
with the stones

15:54.595 --> 15:56.299
to take my calls
after I went Bat.

15:56.397 --> 16:00.003
Sometimes your new friends
are not your new friends.

16:00.102 --> 16:01.204
You feel me?

16:07.408 --> 16:09.913
I fucking told you
worthless dumb-shits,

16:10.012 --> 16:11.976
I wanted contactless delivery.

16:12.079 --> 16:16.252
I'm in the middle of crushing
a peasant uprising
in Neo Bludhaven.

16:19.822 --> 16:21.986
Resistance is futile.

16:23.091 --> 16:24.793
God damn it, Alfred.

16:24.892 --> 16:27.796
I thought I told you to kill
all the remaining
human servants.

16:27.896 --> 16:30.533
Master Robin, we have company.

16:30.633 --> 16:31.600
Oh, fuck.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.403
You're early,
General Neytiri.

16:37.505 --> 16:38.807
Damn it, Cheryl.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.946
-  What's happening?
- Welcome to the Robin's Nest.

16:43.044 --> 16:48.012
Not only am I the architect
and engineer of this awesome
dystopian society,

16:48.116 --> 16:49.852
I am also a collector.

16:49.950 --> 16:54.557
And now, you and Ivy will be
the newest additions
to my menagerie.

16:57.325 --> 16:59.162
Oh, that looks unpleasant.

16:59.260 --> 17:00.896
You ungrateful little shit.

17:00.994 --> 17:03.332
I used to check
your Halloween candy
for anthrax.

17:03.431 --> 17:04.500
All right, Robin.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.002
I held up my end
of the bargain.

17:06.101 --> 17:07.403
Now hand it over.

17:11.539 --> 17:15.111
- You sold us out?
- For a bag of fucking dirt.

17:15.210 --> 17:17.646
We call it Unobtanium, Mother.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.215
Oh, fuck off!

17:19.313 --> 17:22.885
Wow. Sass like that
wins you a spot
in the trophy case,

17:22.984 --> 17:24.921
next to a Kite Man.

17:25.020 --> 17:26.122
Restrain them.

17:27.856 --> 17:29.492
RIP, Moms.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.056
At least I finally
got something
out of this relationship.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.229
How dare you?

17:33.328 --> 17:34.898
Well, why did you
do this to us?

17:34.996 --> 17:36.900
We are cool moms.

17:36.998 --> 17:38.434
We deserve answers.

17:38.533 --> 17:40.169
You don't deserve shit.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.505
And there's no such thing
as a cool mom.

17:42.603 --> 17:45.541
God, you guys are so
fucking self-obsessed.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.243
What are you
so fucking upset about?

17:47.342 --> 17:48.544
You turned out okay.

17:48.643 --> 17:50.646
Yeah. Thanks to Cheryl
who raised me.

17:50.745 --> 17:55.184
Cheryl.
All right, that explains
the backstabbing instincts.

17:55.283 --> 17:58.054
I'm a survivor,
should I blow with the wind.

17:58.152 --> 18:01.324
You two always pretend
everything's fine
even when you don't agree.

18:01.422 --> 18:02.791
Like first day of kindergarten,

18:02.891 --> 18:04.027
I still didn't have a name.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.728
I had to come up
with one myself.

18:05.826 --> 18:08.998
Ha, ha! I knew we didn't
pick that stupid name!

18:09.097 --> 18:10.533
My fucking name rules!

18:10.632 --> 18:11.767
It's true.

18:11.867 --> 18:13.269
I wish it were my name.

18:13.368 --> 18:14.670
No, it sucks!

18:14.768 --> 18:16.973
I'm changing it
to Princess Lady Fingers.

18:17.072 --> 18:18.507
Remember that
weird dream I had

18:18.606 --> 18:20.076
after we hit the bottomless
tiramisu at Mama Maxx?

18:20.175 --> 18:21.610
- Yeah, but--
- Cheryl, you're a notary.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.879
File the futuristic paperwork
on that shit.

18:23.978 --> 18:24.914
Moms rule!

18:25.013 --> 18:26.282
Oh, seriously?

18:26.381 --> 18:28.351
And not to feed into
your monstrous egos,

18:28.449 --> 18:32.321
but FYI, you guys doubling down
on your own bullshit
caused the apocalypse.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.991
Oh, well,
that's a little overdramatic!

18:35.090 --> 18:36.392
Wonder where she got that from?

18:36.491 --> 18:39.762
Excuse me!

18:39.861 --> 18:41.530
Stop yelling.

18:41.624 --> 18:42.999
I don't want your faces
all stretched out
when I freeze you.

18:43.098 --> 18:45.501
- Cheryl, where are we at?
- Freeze up and running.

18:45.599 --> 18:47.503
Bat-drones, bring me
my trophies.

18:47.602 --> 18:49.238
Fuck! Are we in a fight
right now?

18:49.337 --> 18:50.706
'Cause I don't want to die
in a fight.

18:50.805 --> 18:53.042
No. No, we're not fighting.
I love you.

18:53.141 --> 18:54.377
I love you, too.

18:54.475 --> 18:56.512
Oh, my God!
You suck at communicating!

18:56.611 --> 18:58.142
Excuse me.
That's not true.

18:58.245 --> 19:00.783
We tell each other everything
like how we like our eggs,

19:00.882 --> 19:02.986
or how Harley
masturbates to <i>The Iron Lady.</i>

19:03.083 --> 19:05.454
Okay. That was once
and was basically by accident.

19:06.287 --> 19:08.057
Ugh! Okay, listen.

19:08.155 --> 19:09.625
In the interest
of clearing the air
before we get cryo-frozen,

19:09.724 --> 19:11.427
our double-crossing
love child is right.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.596
I haven't told you,
I'm losing my mind.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.431
Honey, you're always
losing your mind.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.865
Yeah. This time
it's different.

19:16.965 --> 19:18.634
I've been sleepwalking, hallucinating.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.203
I had an
out-of-body experience.

19:20.301 --> 19:21.938
I saw another me.

19:22.037 --> 19:23.039
Okay.

19:23.137 --> 19:24.740
Why didn't you just tell me?

19:24.839 --> 19:28.611
I tried, but I kept getting
talk-blocked by your assistant!

19:30.879 --> 19:31.948
King Baby!

19:32.046 --> 19:33.382
Ha!

19:36.318 --> 19:38.487
Oh, my God. Quick!
Now's our chance.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.160
- Come on, stupid-fucking thing.

19:44.259 --> 19:45.761
I just upgraded this shit.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.567
-  My dirt! No!
-  No!

19:51.666 --> 19:53.669
You're clogging
my pee-pee drain!

19:53.769 --> 19:54.703
Get them, Cheryl.

19:59.207 --> 20:01.310
Argh! You're ruining my life!

20:01.409 --> 20:03.207
You guys fuck everything up!

20:03.310 --> 20:05.982
Okay, yes. Yes,
in this situation, I did
fuck everything up for you.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.984
- However--
- Look out!

20:08.083 --> 20:09.318
I did it for us.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.554
Everything I do is for us.

20:11.651 --> 20:14.323
What? So, you're killing it
and I'm not, and I just have
to learn to deal with that?

20:14.421 --> 20:18.394
No, no, no. I just thought
these work boundaries
would protect us.

20:18.492 --> 20:21.931
- But they pushed us apart.

20:22.029 --> 20:24.000
You're right.
I need to be there for you.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.868
We are a team.

20:27.302 --> 20:28.804
You're so full of shit!

20:28.904 --> 20:31.207
Ha! The adults
are talking, kiddo!

20:31.306 --> 20:33.342
Oh, my God! We're the same age.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.343
But we're still your parents.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.179
And you know what?

20:36.277 --> 20:37.947
- You're grounded.

20:38.046 --> 20:39.148
MILF alert.

20:39.247 --> 20:41.017
Fucking yes!

20:41.115 --> 20:42.185
She doesn't even know us.

20:45.252 --> 20:48.557
We make great parents.
Someday, someday.

20:51.726 --> 20:53.562
- Yeah, someday.

20:53.662 --> 20:55.031
I fixed the time-sphere.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.261
- Go time.
- Not so fast.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.568
Pins and needles.
Pins and needles.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.770
King Baby, why did you help us?

21:01.869 --> 21:04.040
I think you two can go back
and do better.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.408
Raise a nice kid

21:05.507 --> 21:06.943
and stop Lex
from destroying the planet.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.946
Oh! An optimist like his dad.
You love to see it.

21:10.045 --> 21:11.780
Wait a minute.
What did you say about Lex?

21:11.880 --> 21:14.984
The system
has rebooted, Master.

21:15.083 --> 21:16.986
Oh, shit. We gotta go.
Come with us!

21:17.084 --> 21:19.923
No, I'd rather
go to bed tonight
and wake up to a new reality.

21:20.020 --> 21:22.525
Like maybe one that's focused
on a different kind of movie,

21:22.622 --> 21:26.729
like a jukebox musical
based on the music
of a certain Swedish pop band.

21:26.828 --> 21:29.933
Good luck. We'll make sure
this apocalypse doesn't happen.

21:30.030 --> 21:33.002
Give me a smooch
on my little baby-boy head
next time you see me.

21:33.100 --> 21:35.204
And make sure
Princess Lady Fingers
puts some ice on that. Okay?

21:35.304 --> 21:36.605
Bye!

21:40.441 --> 21:42.878
Holy shit!
That was wild.

21:42.972 --> 21:45.481
Fucking crazy.

21:45.581 --> 21:46.849
Also kind of fun.

21:46.948 --> 21:48.884
I'm just so glad
you jumped in here after me.

21:48.984 --> 21:50.186
Weirdly, me too.

21:50.285 --> 21:51.620
I mean, I don't know how
to fix all of our problems,

21:51.719 --> 21:53.589
but I know
we're better together.

21:53.688 --> 21:57.826
Yes, and whatever caused
the apocalypse, we'll see it
coming a mile away.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.030
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

22:04.031 --> 22:06.802
-  Wait.
Are we back?

22:06.901 --> 22:09.572
We are. Wait.
Did we leave on the 21st
or the 27th?

22:09.671 --> 22:10.974
What the fuck is this font?

22:11.072 --> 22:13.176
The one and the seven
look the same!

22:13.275 --> 22:15.178
We're six days in the future?

22:15.277 --> 22:17.513
They made it too fancy.
