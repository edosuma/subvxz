00:10.041 --> 00:13.291
<i>It's a brand-new year</i>
<i>in sweet home Chicago.</i>

00:13.375 --> 00:17.416
<i>And one of the perks of having a rooftop</i>
<i>that looks directly into Wrigley Field</i>

00:17.500 --> 00:19.916
<i>is that you get to experience Opening Day.</i>

00:20.750 --> 00:24.666
<i>Not the first game, but when the guys</i>
<i>with the huge hoses show up.</i>

00:24.750 --> 00:28.125
<i>I'm talking about</i>
<i>the groundskeepers, baby!</i>

00:28.625 --> 00:32.000
<i>For years, me and my neighbors</i>
<i>would watch every home game</i>

00:32.083 --> 00:35.250
<i>while partying</i>
<i>our respective wieners and clams off.</i>

00:35.333 --> 00:36.958
<i>God, those were good times.</i>

00:37.041 --> 00:41.666
<i>Sure, most of the old gang</i>
<i>moved to the suburbs or got jobs,</i>

00:41.750 --> 00:43.416
<i>but I'm still here</i>

00:43.500 --> 00:48.125
<i>and I ain't lettin' nothing stop me</i>
<i>from keeping this badass tradition alive!</i>

00:50.666 --> 00:52.833
Lay that sod, Bernice!

00:52.916 --> 00:54.666
-Nice form!

00:54.750 --> 00:56.416
How great is this, Daniel?

00:56.500 --> 00:57.875
What am I looking at, again?

00:57.958 --> 00:59.416
The grounds crew!

00:59.500 --> 01:02.583
Sanchez really stepped up
his rake game in the off-season.

01:02.666 --> 01:03.875
He might be juicin'.

01:03.958 --> 01:05.625
-I can't feel my feet.

01:05.708 --> 01:08.208
Nothing a warm char dog can't fix.

01:08.291 --> 01:11.333
Kurt! This rooftop is
for people who live here

01:11.416 --> 01:13.750
or are married to people who live here,

01:13.833 --> 01:15.541
which disqualifies <i>you!</i>

01:15.625 --> 01:18.416
Ha-ha! Okay. Nice to see you too, Di.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.541
Hi, Uncle Kurt!

01:19.625 --> 01:20.916
<i>Ex</i>-uncle.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.416
I'm just here to get my grill.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.125
Heidi's hosting
her bird book club next week.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.625
They're reading <i>The Pelican Brief. </i>Again.

01:27.708 --> 01:29.333
You're still dating that ditzy--

01:29.416 --> 01:31.625
Heidi! How are ya, hon?

01:31.708 --> 01:33.291
Hi, Diane. Hi, Daniel.

01:33.875 --> 01:34.708
-Ah!

01:34.791 --> 01:37.416
Goddammit! I need to let that cool down.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.250
-Kurt, the birds are in the car.
-Ten-four, babe.

01:40.333 --> 01:41.750
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

01:41.833 --> 01:44.000
All right, have a good Opening Day. Bye!

01:44.083 --> 01:46.833
-Kinda hard now with no hot meat!
-Uh! Tss! Ah!

01:46.916 --> 01:49.916
Hey, we don't need food and warmth
to have a good time.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.958
When I say "grounds,"
you say "crew!" Grounds!

01:53.041 --> 01:53.875
Cold!

01:53.958 --> 01:56.083
Oh, yeah, my nips are rock hard.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.791
And not in the fun way.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.375
Isn't it great, Daniel?

01:59.458 --> 02:02.333
We get to do this together
all season long!

02:02.416 --> 02:03.625
Ugh!

02:03.708 --> 02:06.041
Let's go, Cubbies!

02:15.875 --> 02:18.041
Another perfect rooftop party.

02:18.125 --> 02:20.333
It's endearing
you considered that a party.

02:20.416 --> 02:22.333
Oh, we left the cooler in the hallway.

02:22.416 --> 02:25.041
Oh, I'll get it. I forgot my flip flops.

02:26.458 --> 02:27.458
Hey!

02:27.541 --> 02:29.583
Oh, sorry, thought this was hallway beer.

02:29.666 --> 02:32.541
No, <i>that's</i> hallway beer.

02:32.625 --> 02:35.000
Okay, that fucking rocks!

02:35.083 --> 02:36.166
What did you just say?

02:36.250 --> 02:37.958
I said, "That fucking rocks."

02:38.041 --> 02:40.541
I thought I was the only one
who said that.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.416
That fucking rocks!

02:42.500 --> 02:44.166
I'm Diane, by the way.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.333
Amanda. I'm moving in down the hall,

02:46.416 --> 02:49.250
but I needed to take a White Claw break.
Want to join me?

02:49.333 --> 02:51.375
Does a bear shit in the woods?

02:51.458 --> 02:54.083
No, they do it at Soldier Field, baby.

02:59.541 --> 03:00.583
Claws out!

03:06.375 --> 03:07.958
Do you need help with this box?

03:08.958 --> 03:10.083
"Box."

03:10.166 --> 03:12.666
Can I buy you a drink for helping me move?

03:12.750 --> 03:13.958
That'd be awesome!

03:14.041 --> 03:16.666
I usually go to the bar at noon
because that's when <i>Judge Mathis--</i>

03:16.750 --> 03:18.625
-<i>Judge Mathis</i> starts!

03:18.708 --> 03:21.208
I was physically removed
from his courtroom

03:21.291 --> 03:23.000
for harassing Bailiff Doyle!

03:23.083 --> 03:25.916
Been there, done that. Doyle's a zaddy!

03:30.041 --> 03:32.625
This is where real Chicagoans hang out.

03:32.708 --> 03:34.375
Best bar in the city.

03:34.458 --> 03:36.666
And they got a great pizza puff.

03:36.750 --> 03:41.333
Which I can serve without a food license,
thanks to your buddies the Petes!

03:41.416 --> 03:44.416
Yeah, they work at
air-quotes, "City Hall."

03:44.500 --> 03:49.541
Diane's the queen of making friends
with shady faces in low places.

03:49.625 --> 03:51.666
-Pays to know people.
-Amen.

03:51.750 --> 03:55.083
Speaking of which, our building is a trip.

03:55.166 --> 03:59.208
<i>Apartment 3A, you got Mr. Jorgavich.</i>
<i>High school janitor.</i>

03:59.291 --> 04:00.875
Bad gambling problem.

04:00.958 --> 04:03.000
I know, because we have the same bookie.

04:03.083 --> 04:06.041
<i>Then in 3B, there's Fucks Loud Sophie.</i>

04:06.125 --> 04:08.416
Well, "Fucks Loud" Amanda's here now.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.375
-Yes!

04:09.458 --> 04:11.625
I'll have what she's having!

04:12.208 --> 04:15.208
<i>And then you got Wet Hair Lady down in 1B.</i>

04:15.291 --> 04:17.916
I don't know her name,
but she always has wet hair.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.791
There's one in every building.

04:21.916 --> 04:26.541
Diane, I know it's early to say this,
but… I think you're my spirit animal.

04:26.625 --> 04:27.583
Uh…

04:27.666 --> 04:28.625
No doy!

04:28.708 --> 04:33.208
I thought mine was the giraffe at the zoo
that takes those ten-gallon pisses,

04:33.291 --> 04:36.791
but I'm kind of thinking,
it's a smokeshow named Amanda.

04:41.625 --> 04:44.583
Daniel. This is my new BFF, Amanda.

04:44.666 --> 04:46.250
She just moved in down the hall.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.500
Oh, wow. Nice to meet you.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.916
Um, you're the cutest fucking thing
I've ever seen.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
I want to put you in my pocket. Literally.

04:53.083 --> 04:56.041
Thanks!
But I assume you mean "figuratively."

04:56.125 --> 04:56.958
Ooh!

04:57.041 --> 04:59.750
What are you, a little college boy?
Where do you go to school?

05:00.333 --> 05:04.083
Uh, I was supposed to go to Stanford,
but I'm taking a gap year.

05:04.166 --> 05:05.875
Yeah, I took a "gap year" once.

05:05.958 --> 05:07.083
Rehab!

05:07.166 --> 05:09.333
Yeah! I'll drink to that!

05:10.458 --> 05:14.375
Yeah, I actually took a year
so I could focus on my art.

05:14.458 --> 05:17.541
That's amazing!
You know, art is everything.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.833
What kind of art are you doing?

05:19.916 --> 05:22.250
What kind of art? Hmm. That's a…

05:22.333 --> 05:26.875
The thing is, you can't define "art"
as actually doing, you know?

05:26.958 --> 05:28.458
Oh, I can't even!

05:28.541 --> 05:31.000
I want to cut his face off
and eat it. Literally.

05:31.083 --> 05:34.541
I know, right?
Okay, see you at home, Danny boy.

05:36.375 --> 05:37.875
Hmm? Ah!

05:38.958 --> 05:40.666
Daniel, can you cover me?

05:40.750 --> 05:43.041
I need a five-minute meditation break.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.500
Oh, broadening your horizons, huh?

05:45.583 --> 05:50.083
Yeah, I thought I'd dive in
and follow my passion.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.750
Speaking of passion,
one of our passion fruit smoothies went…

05:54.750 --> 05:58.083
…right through someone,
and stall three is a bit of a mess. Huh.

05:59.041 --> 05:59.958
Right.

06:02.916 --> 06:04.041
Tits up!

06:04.125 --> 06:05.000
Tits out!

06:05.083 --> 06:06.583
What are you gonna do?

06:06.666 --> 06:07.958
I taught her that.

06:08.041 --> 06:11.125
Obviously. You're the only one
who says that.

06:11.208 --> 06:17.125
Gideon, Zuzana, Tina, I would like you
to meet my new bestie, Amanda.

06:17.208 --> 06:18.958
All white women look alike to me,

06:19.041 --> 06:21.500
but you two, you <i>really</i> look alike.

06:21.583 --> 06:22.958
I hear that.

06:23.041 --> 06:24.500
Oh my God, are you Polish?

06:24.583 --> 06:27.791
I went to Prague in college.
I remember nothing.

06:27.875 --> 06:32.750
Diane, I told you on your off days,
feel free to <i>not</i> drop by.

06:32.833 --> 06:36.333
You must be Gideon!
Your fedora is giving me life.

06:36.416 --> 06:41.541
It's not a fedora, it's a troubadour,
and you-will-not-touch it.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.791
Okay, I gotta hit the head.
These drinks went right through me.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.375
How great is Amanda?

06:46.458 --> 06:49.875
She's basically me,
but… five years younger.

06:49.958 --> 06:52.083
Ha! Ten years, at least.

06:52.166 --> 06:53.625
I was gonna say 15.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.083
No, no. 20.

06:55.166 --> 06:58.416
Oh my God, you guys are such zaddies,

06:58.500 --> 07:00.666
which is a term Amanda taught me!

07:00.750 --> 07:03.166
The only zaddy here is <i>me.</i>

07:03.250 --> 07:06.708
Look, I'd like to talk to you about
that lotion you gave me for Christmas.

07:06.791 --> 07:08.083
Shit, did it burn your skin?

07:08.166 --> 07:10.083
I didn't make it!
I didn't even give it to you!

07:10.166 --> 07:11.833
It was Zuzana! Sue her!

07:11.916 --> 07:15.708
No, it's surprisingly effective
and I was thinking we should--

07:15.791 --> 07:18.458
Sorry for what I did in there.
I got really bad aim.

07:18.541 --> 07:20.291
She knows what I'm talking about.

07:20.375 --> 07:23.666
-What? No, I do not.

07:23.750 --> 07:27.875
Okay, we rocked this place out.
Let's go get some burgers, Mand!

07:28.500 --> 07:29.583
Oh, I don't eat meat.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.500
What?!

07:30.583 --> 07:32.708
No! Fuck! No!

07:32.791 --> 07:34.875
I'm messing with you, biatch!

07:36.958 --> 07:40.041
Okay! Seriously! Get out!

07:40.625 --> 07:42.000
<i>Okay, I want you to…</i>

07:42.083 --> 07:45.041
Hey, Bon!
I got three minutes left on the class.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.500
I'm not in last place!

07:47.166 --> 07:50.333
I heard back from Dr. Blatz.
We are not pregnant.

07:50.416 --> 07:52.375
Got it. Uh, should I stop?

07:52.458 --> 07:56.250
If I'm not pregnant,
then why are my boobs so sore, Dr. Blatz?

07:57.958 --> 07:59.625
Son of a gun!

08:00.708 --> 08:02.791
Look, why don't we do something exciting?

08:02.875 --> 08:05.708
Something we couldn't do
if we had another kid right now?

08:05.791 --> 08:08.791
What if I took you to Gibson's
for a romantic meal?

08:08.875 --> 08:12.250
Some steak, a little wine.
I'll even valet the Lincoln.

08:12.333 --> 08:15.708
No looking for a spot tonight!
Unless there's one nearby.

08:15.791 --> 08:19.083
I guess if I'm not pregnant,
I can still eat like I am!

08:19.166 --> 08:21.541
<i>Uh oh,</i>
<i>looks like Mark W. fell off his bike!</i>

08:21.625 --> 08:23.041
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine!

08:24.791 --> 08:27.458
"Hey, girl, it's 2:00 p.m. You up?"

08:27.541 --> 08:30.416
"Text me or call me or just text me."

08:30.500 --> 08:33.500
"Okay. Byeeee."

08:33.583 --> 08:35.583
Cat with heart eyes and a panda bear.

08:37.666 --> 08:38.958
Bonnie Whiddington?

08:39.041 --> 08:41.291
That depends. Are you from Rent-A-Center?

08:41.375 --> 08:44.375
'Cause that BarcaLounger
was all slashed up when I got it.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.416
No, I'm Ken Bundt.

08:45.500 --> 08:48.625
I work for Event Corp,
the premiere event developer in the area?

08:48.708 --> 08:50.291
Now, Bonnie, have you ever considered--?

08:50.375 --> 08:53.916
Ugh, if you're about to say you want us
to sell you our rooftop access,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.375
then save your breath.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.000
-Hard pass.
-But--

08:57.083 --> 08:58.541
You people are vultures.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.875
I don't know how many times I have to say
we're not selling the rooftop.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.625
But each condo owner would be--

09:03.708 --> 09:06.291
"Handsomely rewarded," I know the spiel.

09:06.375 --> 09:09.625
But much like movies with subtitles,
I ain't interested!

09:09.708 --> 09:12.416
Well, do give me a call
if you change your mind, Bonnie.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.208
Read my lips:

09:14.291 --> 09:16.916
Eat my ass!

09:17.500 --> 09:18.375
Who was that?

09:18.458 --> 09:21.250
Ah, just some jerk
trying to buy the rooftop.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.500
-Why?

09:22.583 --> 09:24.916
You don't know? I'll show ya.

09:28.916 --> 09:33.458
Art is about confrontation,
confronting your fears.

09:33.541 --> 09:37.375
Today, we will face our culture's
fear of the feminine

09:37.458 --> 09:40.416
by drawing a portrait
of the nude female body.

09:40.500 --> 09:45.666
Look upon its natural form,
free of the male gaze.

09:45.750 --> 09:46.916
Heidi?

09:48.291 --> 09:50.166
Most of these places sold out,

09:50.250 --> 09:53.541
put in professional bleachers
with VIP access.

09:53.625 --> 09:56.166
We're the only building who's still OG.

09:56.250 --> 09:59.625
-How much are they offering to buy it for?
-Like, 50 grand.

10:00.208 --> 10:01.708
Whoa, that's a lot of money.

10:01.791 --> 10:03.791
Yeah, but I'd never sign off on that.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.708
I'm not gonna pay to watch a game
from my own rooftop!

10:06.791 --> 10:09.125
Plus, I got so many memories.

10:09.208 --> 10:12.166
You know how many home runs
Sammy Sosa hit up here?

10:12.250 --> 10:15.625
-And I ain't talking baseball!
-Hey now!

10:15.708 --> 10:17.583
So, why'd that dick call you Bonnie?

10:17.666 --> 10:19.000
Bonnie's my sister.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.791
She technically owns my unit.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.875
She's a real shithead. But I love her.

10:22.958 --> 10:23.791
Kinda.

10:23.875 --> 10:25.416
Yeah, she sounds lame.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.416
Nevertheless, I should bounce.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.458
Wanna hang at my place tonight?
I got some poppers!

10:30.541 --> 10:32.958
Jalapeño <i>and</i> the other kind…

10:33.041 --> 10:36.166
Oh, no, I don't want
to have the greatest night ever!

10:36.250 --> 10:38.458
Where have you been all my life?

10:38.541 --> 10:40.750
See you at 7:00, biatch!

10:48.208 --> 10:49.791
Maybe I should check on her.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.375
-Hey, we said 7:00, right?

10:54.458 --> 10:56.166
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.458
I'm actually a little busy right now.

10:58.541 --> 11:00.458
-Is that Fucks Loud Sophie?

11:00.541 --> 11:02.750
Wow, even Wet Hair Lady is here.

11:02.833 --> 11:05.000
Wait, are all the neighbors here?

11:05.083 --> 11:06.875
Yeah. They all just came by.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.041
So random.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.000
Oh.

11:09.083 --> 11:10.583
So, should I come in?

11:10.666 --> 11:13.833
Ah, well, we kind of
paired off for charades.

11:13.916 --> 11:16.791
Maybe it's more fun
if we… hung out later on?

11:16.875 --> 11:18.416
-Is that cool?
-Uh…

11:18.500 --> 11:20.083
Yeah! So cool.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.250
Awesome sauce!

11:22.000 --> 11:25.416
Oh my God, Mr. Jorgavich,
you're my spirit animal.

11:26.291 --> 11:30.333
And then I realized six hours later,
you don't pair off for charades!

11:30.416 --> 11:32.583
Did I do something wrong to Amanda?

11:32.666 --> 11:35.500
Did I offend her somehow?
Should I be offended?

11:35.583 --> 11:38.583
Child, it is not <i>possible</i>
for you to be offended.

11:38.666 --> 11:39.916
Because you lack--

11:40.000 --> 11:41.666
What is the word I'm looking for?

11:41.750 --> 11:42.833
Propriety.

11:42.916 --> 11:44.291
Thank you, Gideon!

11:44.375 --> 11:46.708
But what do I do about being ghosted?

11:46.791 --> 11:49.041
Which, by the way,
is a term I learned from Amanda.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.583
Don't go running back to her.

11:50.666 --> 11:53.166
You got to play hard to get,
even with friendships.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.208
Who the hell can I party with now?

11:55.291 --> 11:56.583
Oh, puh-lease.

11:56.666 --> 12:00.791
Girl, I have seen you
get wasted in an open manhole.

12:00.875 --> 12:02.333
You're right, Gideon!

12:02.416 --> 12:05.750
If I have my own party, she'll hear it
and want to come and join it.

12:05.833 --> 12:07.416
-Thank you!
-I didn't say any of that.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.166
Hey! There is a customer in your chair!

12:12.708 --> 12:16.291
Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Party!

12:19.583 --> 12:21.541
You don't say!

12:21.625 --> 12:24.250
Oh, y'all are hilarious!

12:24.333 --> 12:26.166
That broad can dance!

12:26.916 --> 12:27.958
Whew!

12:28.041 --> 12:29.125
-Mm-mm!
-What are you doing?

12:29.208 --> 12:30.041
Ugh!

12:30.125 --> 12:32.583
Did it sound like I was having
a party in here from the hallway?

12:32.666 --> 12:35.708
No, it sounded like you were doing
a one-woman show.

12:35.791 --> 12:37.250
It's called playing hard to get.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.916
Now, when I point at you,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.875
you have to laugh and say,
"Good one, Diane."

12:41.958 --> 12:43.458
Mmm… hm!

12:44.041 --> 12:45.625
Ha ha, good one, Diane.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.750
You would say that, Vince Vaughn!

12:48.833 --> 12:51.041
Aunt Diane, I need to tell you something.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.208
I had my art class today,
and the model was--

12:53.291 --> 12:54.625
<i>-Opa!</i>

12:55.333 --> 12:56.625
Oh. Oprah.

12:56.708 --> 12:58.791
Hey! Gimme a quick Oprah impression.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.166
Try the spinach dip!

13:03.250 --> 13:05.375
No, I made it myself!

13:05.458 --> 13:07.666
It's okay. I'm not giving up art.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.750
-This is just a very unique hiccup.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.125
…looking good! You look--

13:11.208 --> 13:12.708
-You've lost weight!

13:12.791 --> 13:13.916
Ciao, this is Samuel.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.583
Hi, it's Daniel Whiddington.
I'm one of your art students.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.541
Ah! How can I help you?

13:19.625 --> 13:21.916
FYI, I'm about to slip into the tub.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.583
Well, as much as I want
to pursue a career in the arts,

13:24.666 --> 13:26.458
I'm afraid I can't finish your class.

13:26.541 --> 13:30.250
Daniel, to be an artist,
you must confront your fear.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.416
Embrace it.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.208
Got it. Confront my fear!

13:33.291 --> 13:34.250
I'll try that.

13:34.333 --> 13:37.000
Also, there's no refunds,
even for the online processing fee.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.666
Ugh!

13:41.000 --> 13:43.416
-Confront your fears.

13:43.500 --> 13:44.875
Drink, drink, drink!

13:46.791 --> 13:48.250
hey, girl!

13:48.833 --> 13:50.333
Oh. Out of breath, huh?

13:50.416 --> 13:52.416
You have a little quickie on the sticky?

13:52.500 --> 13:53.750
I wish, girl.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.625
Just having a huge rager.

13:55.708 --> 13:57.666
Uh, everyone's in the bathroom.

13:57.750 --> 14:01.083
Cool-cool. Hey, I wanted
to get your sister's number.

14:01.166 --> 14:04.250
It's just a boring
condo association thingy.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.500
I'm trying to put in a new powder room.

14:06.583 --> 14:07.541
"Powder room"?

14:07.625 --> 14:09.750
Toot, toot. I'll bring the powder.

14:09.833 --> 14:12.083
Not if I bring it first. Toot, toot.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.041
Anyway, can I get Bonnie's number?

14:15.125 --> 14:16.541
Right-right-right.

14:17.166 --> 14:20.250
Hey, by the way, if you need help
with permits and stuff, let me know.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.041
Happy to call my friends the Petes.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.166
Oh my God, that sounds so awesome!

14:24.250 --> 14:26.333
They sound so cool. Okay, byeee!

14:26.416 --> 14:27.416
Okay. Bye?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.083
I guess we'll hang later.

14:31.458 --> 14:32.291
Mm.

14:32.375 --> 14:36.083
I gotta say,
that angel food cake is sinful.

14:37.208 --> 14:40.583
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, babe.
I-- I thought you said I could finish it?

14:40.666 --> 14:43.291
I was just so sure it was happening.

14:43.791 --> 14:46.208
Got my hopes up,
and I just started thinking

14:46.291 --> 14:48.958
how special it would be
to have another baby.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.375
I know, honey.

14:50.458 --> 14:51.875
You were really excited.

14:51.958 --> 14:52.791
I mean, we.

14:52.875 --> 14:53.708
<i>We</i> were.

14:53.791 --> 14:57.583
Mark, I've been thinking,
and I still want to have another child.

14:57.666 --> 15:00.250
I think we should
see a fertility specialist.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.541
Mm! Ugh!

15:01.625 --> 15:02.500
It's just…

15:02.583 --> 15:06.458
IVF is <i>very</i> expensive and,
you know, we had plans.

15:06.541 --> 15:10.000
We want to buy that RV
and visit every presidential library.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.166
Remember?

15:11.250 --> 15:13.500
I know, but I was great at being a mom

15:13.583 --> 15:16.500
and this whole thing
made me realize I want to do it again.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.500
Bon, if you want to do it, I'm in.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.041
We'll find the money somehow.

15:22.125 --> 15:26.083
And they have some great virtual tours
of the presidential libraries on YouTube.

15:26.583 --> 15:29.083
I can't believe we're gonna have
another little one!

15:29.166 --> 15:31.291
-I'll give you a little one.
-Mark, don't be gross.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.958
Yeah. I-- Sorry.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.625
This is so uncomfortable.

15:36.708 --> 15:38.916
First nude? You get used to it.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.041
No, the model is my aunt.

15:41.125 --> 15:42.625
I mean, she's dating my uncle.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.750
Well, my ex-uncle, which I guess
makes her my ex-aunt-to-be?

15:45.833 --> 15:47.000
Is that even possible?

15:47.083 --> 15:49.208
It's so weird that's she's totally shaved.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.000
Mm.

15:55.541 --> 15:59.000
<i>Daniel, confront your fear.</i>

16:12.958 --> 16:15.375
Hey, you. It's five o'clock somewhere.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.708
Shall we head to Guthrie's?
They fixed the toilet.

16:17.791 --> 16:21.208
-Um…
-Well, well, well…

16:21.291 --> 16:23.291
Uh, excuse me. What the fuck?

16:23.375 --> 16:26.250
Good news. The bleachers are going up.

16:26.333 --> 16:28.625
Over my dead, perfect body!

16:28.708 --> 16:30.333
Oh, it's happening.

16:30.416 --> 16:33.166
And we couldn't have done it
without this little firecracker.

16:33.250 --> 16:34.708
-What?

16:34.791 --> 16:37.500
Amanda! You ghosting zaddy!

16:37.583 --> 16:40.666
Yeah, she got
all the residents to sign off.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.500
Uh, no, she didn't.

16:42.583 --> 16:44.208
Because I didn't sign shit!

16:44.291 --> 16:47.041
No, but your sister did.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.666
<i>Hi, I'm Gwyneth Paltrow</i>
<i>and I'm here to talk to you</i>

16:52.750 --> 16:55.791
<i>about the benefits of vaginal</i>
<i>fish oil supplements.</i>

16:56.791 --> 16:59.375
Mark, where did you hide the Chase Visa?

16:59.458 --> 17:01.333
How could you sell my rooftop?!

17:01.416 --> 17:02.916
That place is sacred!

17:03.000 --> 17:04.375
It's my skanktuary!

17:04.458 --> 17:07.916
Okay. I knew you'd be upset,
but the rooftop belongs to Mark and me

17:08.000 --> 17:10.458
and we have some expenses on the horizon.

17:10.541 --> 17:12.333
You finally getting your neck done?

17:12.416 --> 17:14.708
What? W-What's wrong with my neck?

17:14.791 --> 17:17.916
How could you take away
the thing I love most in the world?!

17:18.000 --> 17:19.583
What about your son?

17:19.666 --> 17:21.125
Besides Mikey!

17:21.208 --> 17:22.208
And booze!

17:22.291 --> 17:24.125
And that Michael Jordan documentary!

17:24.208 --> 17:26.125
But this is top five!

17:26.208 --> 17:29.625
If you need money so bad,
here's an idea. Get a job.

17:29.708 --> 17:33.291
Okay, I don't have
to explain myself to you.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.791
I sold it. The end.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.666
Well, I'm gonna stop this.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.750
Reminder, you live there for free!

17:42.583 --> 17:43.583
You did it!

17:43.666 --> 17:45.583
And you made a masterpiece.

17:45.666 --> 17:48.125
Well, not a masterpiece,
but something that isn't bad

17:48.208 --> 17:50.416
for someone with
your experience or skill level.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.708
Thanks for talking me through it
the other night.

17:52.791 --> 17:57.791
Never let your fear stop you
from confronting your fears.

18:03.541 --> 18:06.000
I'll see you later tonight.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.291
Mm…

18:07.375 --> 18:09.208
-What? God.

18:09.291 --> 18:12.291
No! Oh my God. No!

18:17.541 --> 18:19.083
Uh, can I get you a drink, my love?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.000
Mark! No.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.625
Right. No alcohol.

18:22.375 --> 18:23.916
Can I have one?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.750
Hi, honey. How are you?

18:25.833 --> 18:27.500
I'm fine. I think.

18:27.583 --> 18:29.083
As long as I don't see Uncle Kurt.

18:29.166 --> 18:30.666
-Why?
-Long story.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.708
This is weird up here now.

18:32.791 --> 18:35.416
Everyone's wearing pants
and no one's throwing up.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.041
And Diane is okay with this?

18:37.125 --> 18:39.000
No, not at all. But we had to.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.250
Right.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.166
Why?

18:41.250 --> 18:43.541
Well, sweetie,
we wanted to tell you earlier,

18:43.625 --> 18:46.708
but your father and I
are gonna have another baby.

18:46.791 --> 18:48.791
What? You're pregnant?

18:48.875 --> 18:50.750
No, not yet.

18:50.833 --> 18:52.833
But, we're preparing for me to be.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.083
Soon. Maybe.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.500
We've been preparing
in every room in the house.

18:56.583 --> 18:57.416
Ugh!

18:57.500 --> 18:59.083
Dad! Gross.

18:59.166 --> 19:02.500
Daniel, are you ready
to have a little brother or sister

19:02.583 --> 19:05.583
or whatever gender they feel they are?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.791
Mom, remember we talked about this.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.916
You don't have to try so hard. Okay?

19:10.000 --> 19:12.208
Hey, guys.
I just wanted to welcome you all

19:12.291 --> 19:16.916
to the ribbon cutting
for the new Event Corp rooftop suites.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.458
Now, before we all get bombed,

19:19.541 --> 19:22.291
I'd like to thank Ken
for his kick-ass party.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.625
-Not so fast!

19:25.250 --> 19:27.916
Did someone say "kick-ass party"?

19:28.958 --> 19:31.916
Who are all these people?
They can't come up here. Security!

19:32.000 --> 19:33.375
I'll take care of this.

19:33.458 --> 19:35.625
Step aside, cheese-dick.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.375
Oh, shit. Uncle Kurt.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.458
This is happening
whether you like it or not.

19:40.541 --> 19:41.750
Lower the bleachers!

19:41.833 --> 19:43.416
No! Stop!

19:44.166 --> 19:46.708
People! We can't let this happen.

19:46.791 --> 19:50.166
I know that these scumbags
are offering you lots of money,

19:50.250 --> 19:53.083
but this city
isn't just about rich assholes!

19:53.166 --> 19:56.041
It's also about poor assholes
like me and my friends!

19:56.125 --> 19:57.250
-Tell them, Di!

19:57.333 --> 19:59.708
This old rooftop is just like us.

19:59.791 --> 20:03.916
Broken down, not much to look at,
crawling with vermin…

20:04.000 --> 20:05.958
-What do you mean?
-What? Not cool.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.041
But goddammit, it's authentic.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.541
And there's not
a lot of that left around here.

20:10.625 --> 20:14.291
So as long as I stand
in this spot, on this roof,

20:14.375 --> 20:17.875
those shitty corporate bleachers
will not come down. Ever!

20:18.875 --> 20:20.333
-Holy!
-Oh my gosh!

20:21.041 --> 20:22.458
Ah, balls!

20:22.958 --> 20:25.500
That speech was totes adorbs.

20:25.583 --> 20:27.250
Too bad it didn't matter.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.375
This is a done deal, honey.

20:29.458 --> 20:30.958
Oh, no, it's not.

20:31.541 --> 20:34.625
Not according to
the City Hall building inspector!

20:34.708 --> 20:36.333
And his deputy!

20:36.416 --> 20:38.708
-What the hell?
-The Petes!

20:38.791 --> 20:40.291
-Lift those bleachers!

20:40.375 --> 20:41.750
What the hell is this?

20:41.833 --> 20:44.375
Thanks to an anonymous concerned citizen,

20:44.458 --> 20:48.541
we have found that you are in violation
of city ordinance 4-4, section…

20:48.625 --> 20:49.791
I forgot.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.708
We got proper sign-off on everything!

20:51.791 --> 20:53.333
No, you missed some forms.

20:53.416 --> 20:55.791
But for a small fee, we could expedite--

20:55.875 --> 20:56.916
Right, right. Sorry.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
It's not happening.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.708
Get them out of here, boys.

21:02.666 --> 21:03.750
You know, Amanda,

21:03.833 --> 21:06.291
I was pretty sure
we were two peas in a pod,

21:06.375 --> 21:09.125
but then I realized
I don't want to be in a pod with you.

21:09.208 --> 21:10.750
I don't even want to be a pea.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.625
I want to be a kernel of corn
with these people.

21:13.708 --> 21:15.833
Covered in butter, perfectly salted.

21:15.916 --> 21:18.833
Sorry, Mikey,
can you get that plate away from me?

21:18.916 --> 21:20.125
Ten-four, Ma.

21:20.208 --> 21:22.458
I want that money. Do you hear me?

21:22.541 --> 21:24.333
I want that money!

21:24.416 --> 21:25.375
Ah! Ugh!

21:25.458 --> 21:26.625
-Ow!

21:26.708 --> 21:27.958
Are you okay?

21:28.041 --> 21:29.916
I hate this stupid old building!

21:30.000 --> 21:30.833
-Ow!

21:30.916 --> 21:33.583
And this stupid old building hates you!

21:33.666 --> 21:36.083
You're a stupid old building.

21:36.166 --> 21:38.500
Now let's frickin' party!

21:44.000 --> 21:45.625
Um… Uncle Kurt?

21:45.708 --> 21:46.666
Hey there, bud.

21:46.750 --> 21:48.750
<i>Confront your fear.</i>

21:48.833 --> 21:52.833
Hey, so, I was taking an art class
and Heidi was the nude model

21:52.916 --> 21:54.750
and I had to draw her, which was weird,

21:54.833 --> 21:57.208
but then I saw her make out
with the teacher after class.

21:57.291 --> 21:59.375
-I know.
-I'm sorry you had to find out--

21:59.458 --> 22:00.291
Wait, what?

22:00.375 --> 22:01.208
I know.

22:01.291 --> 22:03.875
Heidi and I have an… open relationship.

22:03.958 --> 22:06.541
We'd seen it on a rerun of <i>Jenny Jones</i>.

22:06.625 --> 22:10.958
Oh, well, that is very…
progressive, I guess?

22:11.041 --> 22:15.500
It's a little weird, but, uh…
at least I have my options open too.

22:15.583 --> 22:18.500
Anyhoo, Daniel, I got to get going.

22:18.583 --> 22:21.666
Well, Bonnie, looks like
Diane won this one.

22:21.750 --> 22:24.375
BT-dubs, the turtleneck actually works.

22:24.458 --> 22:26.041
I'm not getting my neck done.

22:26.125 --> 22:29.916
We wanted that money because
we're trying to have another child.

22:30.000 --> 22:30.833
Bon!

22:30.916 --> 22:33.708
Holy shit, I am so sorry.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.500
I didn't know that's what it was for.

22:35.583 --> 22:36.666
I can undo all of this.

22:36.750 --> 22:39.541
We'll bring in the bleachers.
I'm paging the Petes right now.

22:39.625 --> 22:42.458
I don't know if it's because
I'm more emotional than usual,

22:42.541 --> 22:46.458
but what you said
under the bleachers made me cry.

22:46.541 --> 22:50.291
I know how much you love it up here.
And I want you to have it.

22:50.375 --> 22:52.041
What about the baby money?

22:52.125 --> 22:53.250
We'll make it work.

22:53.875 --> 22:56.708
If you want some primo sperm,
I know a guy.

22:56.791 --> 22:57.916
It's the Petes.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.541
Stop. Everything you're saying is bad.

23:01.041 --> 23:02.250
Let's go home, Mark.

23:02.875 --> 23:04.416
Is my sperm not primo?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.208
Should we go inside?

23:08.416 --> 23:09.333
Not yet.
