WEBVTT

00:14.139 --> 00:15.974
Bitch, do you know me?

00:16.558 --> 00:18.143
Do you fucking know me?

00:18.935 --> 00:22.272
I'm gonna ask you one question.
Do you know me outside of this jail?

00:22.355 --> 00:24.274
You don't know what the fuck I got, bitch.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.609
-Yeah, you know.
-I don't got to lie.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.863
Anything I say could be stamped
and verified, bitch.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.323
You making yourself look bad.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.577
I don't like, you know,
being mixed up in messes.

00:35.660 --> 00:39.080
They sit and talk about each other.
I stay in my cell and read my books.

00:39.914 --> 00:43.334
This bitch, she kept on saying
a bunch of shit about me.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.587
I was like, are you serious?

00:45.670 --> 00:49.466
Girl, you is nobody
for me to get in this toilet and speak on!

00:50.091 --> 00:51.259
Man, we done.

00:51.342 --> 00:53.011
We done with that, okay?

00:53.094 --> 00:55.305
She's slanging Buster over a toilet.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.892
'Cause they on the same wall.
You understand?

00:58.975 --> 01:01.061
So when she opens her toilet,

01:01.144 --> 01:04.272
and she opens her toilet,
they can hear each other.

01:04.355 --> 01:07.317
You look like Diddy Kong,
and you're on your last life.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.526
All right, we done.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.487
We done, okay?

01:10.570 --> 01:12.072
Over and out.

01:12.155 --> 01:15.366
It's stupid and ridiculous.
I ain't got time for that.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.120
I can't come to terms with putting
my head next to a toilet bowl.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.581
Head, toilet-- don't go together.

01:21.664 --> 01:22.624
Mm-mm.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.959
-No.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.841
Move off of talking about me, yo.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.843
You act like you obsessed with me, Trina.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.970
I don't even know your name, baby!

01:36.054 --> 01:37.472
-What's your fucking name?
-Good!

01:37.555 --> 01:41.476
-I don't know your name! Gotta ask for it.
-I keep my name under wraps for a reason.

01:41.559 --> 01:45.188
-Don't know your name, I'm gonna find out!
-Let's go. Lock down time.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.149
It's not over. We gonna keep it calm
because Picard up in here,

01:48.233 --> 01:51.569
but it's far, far, far from over.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.782
Girl, go ahead and let's get it started.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.160
You just don't know about me, bitch.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.913
I live for this shit!

02:13.883 --> 02:16.094
In Orleans Parish Justice Center,

02:16.845 --> 02:19.931
located in downtown
New Orleans, Louisiana,

02:21.891 --> 02:25.103
we have 24 pods that hold 60 inmates.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.441
I'm innocent!

02:30.525 --> 02:33.862
We currently have
81 females with 908 males,

02:33.945 --> 02:36.948
a total of 989 people.

02:37.031 --> 02:40.201
The males and the females
is totally opposite.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.162
The males, to me, is more laid back.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.540
I got a 7-year-old daughter.
I do her hair better than her Momma.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.750
So every day I've got to moisturize it.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.919
-Oh, yeah. You got to do that.
-So…

02:50.503 --> 02:53.923
Well, it is scary, because everybody
don't have a chance in New Orleans.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.216
"Whereas it's safe to say that

02:55.300 --> 02:58.011
in this place today it was preordained
for me to be a target."

02:58.094 --> 03:01.556
"Unlawful, but justice doesn't have
sympathy for a pigment such as mine."

03:01.639 --> 03:04.934
"Another young Black male
misunderstood. Jailbird."

03:06.311 --> 03:08.897
They is in a bad predicament,
and we're not here to judge them.

03:13.651 --> 03:16.571
The females, they can get
rowdy and loud at times.

03:17.822 --> 03:20.200
Look at Gigi face. She ain't having it!

03:20.283 --> 03:22.368
Females,
this is a competitive thing.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.286
They will try you.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.920
Sometimes it's so freaking chaotic.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.004
She's lying!

03:33.087 --> 03:34.464
Something wrong with you!

03:34.547 --> 03:36.966
You dirty fucking mustache ho!

03:37.050 --> 03:38.301
Stupid bitch!

03:38.384 --> 03:39.260
Fuck.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.473
It gets real wild in here.

03:50.688 --> 03:53.483
Let's be clear, we have our good days
and we have our bad days.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.319
Every situation is different,
every person is different.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.446
It's a battle.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.034
How y'all doing this morning?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.370
God is good.

04:05.453 --> 04:06.955
Thank you, all the time.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.957
Hey, how you all doing?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.125
I know y'all better stop!

04:13.544 --> 04:14.754
Jamie!

04:14.837 --> 04:15.672
What?!

04:15.755 --> 04:17.590
Man, don't fucking holler at me like that.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.092
Fuck, stupid ass.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.053
When I got released last time, I--

04:22.136 --> 04:24.847
I had a lot of things I wanted  to do
and I said I was gonna do,

04:24.931 --> 04:26.641
once I touched that world,
different story.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.518
-And now you're busy--
-Exactly, you're fake.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.980
-You're fake, too. No problem.
-Fuck you, Jamie.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.856
I'm just keeping it real with you.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.151
Every time I went home and said I was
gonna keep it real with somebody, I did.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.321
You know what I'm saying? And I was
in the penitentiary with these people.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.906
- I kept it real. I wrote.
-You wrote.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.367
You could have at least sent a card
with your named signed.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.203
It don't take much. A card cost
50 cents at the dollar store.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.121
Yeah.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.206
I don't mind being here.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.792
It's not… bad for me.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.962
I'm like a really regimented,
scheduled-type person,

04:56.045 --> 04:57.213
and I get that in here.

04:57.297 --> 05:01.050
Of course I want to go home to my family
and I wanna change the person I am,

05:01.134 --> 05:03.386
but it's not hard for me to live in here.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.512
I'm leaving in a few days.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.306
-You ain't tell me that one.
-Thursday.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.016
Give me my shampoo and conditioner back.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.892
That's mine. But I'll give it to you.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.561
That was mine at first.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.689
-Okay, I'm gonna give it back.
-Yeah. It was mine first.

05:14.772 --> 05:15.940
All right.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.443
-Well…
-You gonna wax them hairs off your chin?

05:18.526 --> 05:20.486
You-- Not on camera, bitch!

05:20.570 --> 05:21.904
Them hairs is bad.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.823
Bitch, get the fuck--

05:30.371 --> 05:32.332
New Orleans, for me, is evil.

05:32.915 --> 05:33.833
Because

05:34.375 --> 05:37.045
I have destructed
my entire life down here.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.884
Well, I have, uh, possession
of crack cocaine,

05:42.967 --> 05:45.345
aggravated criminal damage to property,

05:45.428 --> 05:46.387
theft,

05:46.471 --> 05:49.057
trespassing, and absconding my probation.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.976
I'm not even supposed to be down here.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.938
Like, the judge literally
court ordered me to not be in this city.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.816
I created such a ruckus and havoc.

06:03.821 --> 06:07.825
Unfortunately I was
high and up for entirely too long.

06:10.119 --> 06:13.331
I attempted to get someone
in my car that I didn't know,

06:14.707 --> 06:16.959
-ran into the back of their car.

06:18.878 --> 06:23.633
Now, this is allegedly, like, because
I don't quite… exactly remember.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.636
Ran around

06:26.719 --> 06:29.097
without clothes on for a little while,

06:29.847 --> 06:31.557
-…and, um…

06:32.266 --> 06:35.937
…proceeded to tell people
that I was in… the Secret Service.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.486
The Secret Service
actually came and interviewed me.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.780
The real Secret Service.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.990
I know this sounds crazy, but it's true.

06:49.742 --> 06:51.077
Because I was

06:51.828 --> 06:53.371
impersonating a

06:53.454 --> 06:54.872
federal agent.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.293
So,

06:59.877 --> 07:01.337
that's, uh,

07:02.213 --> 07:03.714
that really messed me up.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.101
-It's okay.
-You spooking?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.727
No, I'm not. Shut the door.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.146
My best friend is Taylor.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.440
That's my only friend.
I only rock with one person.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.692
And you're the only one I care about,

07:22.775 --> 07:25.069
the person I plan on keeping
in contact with when I leave,

07:25.153 --> 07:27.405
because I know
it's a life-long thing that we got.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.158
You need to get right, though.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.493
I can make such a good turnaround,
and you know my heart.

07:32.577 --> 07:34.412
-You know my heart of hearts, you do.
-I do.

07:34.495 --> 07:36.456
-If anybody knows, you know.
-I know.

07:36.539 --> 07:39.917
And to go from always what I was
to always what I want to be,

07:40.001 --> 07:41.627
it's gonna be major.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.712
A major difference.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.464
-Comeback.
-Right.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.340
Bitch, I got that comeback.

07:46.924 --> 07:50.052
My release date is coming up,
and I wanna get my life together.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.680
So I can't afford to get
too messy in here.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.682
I thought they said--

07:54.765 --> 07:56.225
Ooh, there goes Steele.

07:56.309 --> 08:00.521
Ooh, she walking back and forth
like she tweaking.

08:01.522 --> 08:04.817
I thought they said…

08:04.901 --> 08:06.569
I thought… Whoa.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.323
She's walking, she's--

08:10.406 --> 08:13.034
-What'd she say?
-I don't know. Oh, shit.

08:18.873 --> 08:23.127
-What she told you? Don't come up here?
-Yeah, she said not to come in the cell.

08:23.211 --> 08:28.132
She be gnawin' it, like they really
taking it big 'ol serious.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.719
I guess she trying to play like
she Big Kahuna right now.

08:31.802 --> 08:34.597
Like, we have to be in here
to talk about what we need to talk about.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.641
We can't talk about this outside.

08:40.561 --> 08:41.479
Can I come out?

08:41.562 --> 08:43.314
-Yeah.
-Okay.

08:44.148 --> 08:46.484
So anyway, back to what
we was talking about.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.738
If I wanna stay in here on lock-down,
I'll like make a fake body, like,

08:50.821 --> 08:52.240
underneath my blanket.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.451
I'll put my store bag, clothes and stuff
and make like it looks like a body.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.079
And I'll just hide under the mat
until the deputy leaves and then

08:58.162 --> 09:00.873
-everything's fine.
-Right.

09:00.957 --> 09:04.210
-We got to do it to the max.
-I don't wanna be separated from her.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.628
Like, ever.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.755
For any length of time.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.551
I'm co-dependent on her. I am.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.846
-She's what gets me through most of this…
-Right.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.099
Do you guys
get in trouble for doing this?

09:18.182 --> 09:19.183
-Yup.
-Uh-huh.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.184
Every other day.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.143
I don't care.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.355
-Aww. Himber!

09:24.438 --> 09:27.942
It's like, we not the same.
Our drug of choice not the same, but,

09:28.025 --> 09:32.154
a lot of shit in our life
just like the same, so,

09:32.238 --> 09:35.032
we just been close since I got here.

09:37.159 --> 09:39.203
Harley and Jamie,

09:40.079 --> 09:43.040
them the only two
I really fuck with in here.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.333
High-five, friend.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.210
Four five, friend.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.213
-Yeah, keep them coming.
-Oh.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.048
Is she a good friend?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.759
Yeah, she aggravating, though.

09:53.843 --> 09:54.844
Oh, I'm what?

09:54.927 --> 09:55.928
Aggravating!

09:56.012 --> 09:57.013
And what you are?

09:57.096 --> 10:01.017
Calm, cool, and collected?
Ha! I don't think so.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.393
Anyways…

10:03.060 --> 10:05.438
The relationship I got with Jamie,

10:05.521 --> 10:07.857
we ain't been on each other
that long, but now…

10:07.940 --> 10:09.025
Huh?

10:09.108 --> 10:10.568
Hold on!

10:10.651 --> 10:12.028
That's Jamie.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.157
They like me, because I'm shortie.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.200
-But why?
-With a finger missing.

10:18.701 --> 10:21.704
Like, this my best friend,
because I been knowing her longer.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.290
But me and Jamie,
she says she's in love with me,

10:24.373 --> 10:26.250
even though we're "friends."

10:26.334 --> 10:28.628
And she think Harley and I,

10:29.337 --> 10:31.464
be like, you know,
messing with each other,

10:31.547 --> 10:32.632
but we really don't.

10:33.549 --> 10:36.427
-Really.

10:36.510 --> 10:37.345
But…

10:37.928 --> 10:42.099
Jamie just be territorial 'cause
she just do everything I say.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.560
I was here first, so, like,

10:45.770 --> 10:48.064
you can't kick me out the spot I'm in.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.901
But she really like a good friend though.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.654
I would really fuck somebody up
for that little bitch.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.614
For real.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.741
She all right though.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.092
What you got?

11:16.175 --> 11:17.468
Why am I on lockdown?

11:17.551 --> 11:20.137
Just for a fuss that I didn't--
I wasn't even fussing back.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.931
First, let's start from the beginning.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.308
You're assuming I knew
that you had a fuss.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.060
Well, it wasn't even a fuss.

11:26.143 --> 11:30.147
We was all using "communication skills"
like you told us to use, right?

11:30.231 --> 11:32.858
Okay, I'm listening.
You had an argument.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.069
-She come up the stairs behind me.
-Mm-hmm.

11:35.152 --> 11:38.823
So we pass a few words, so explain to me
why I'm on lockdown for that.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.450
Because y'all passed a few words.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.078
It's like a calm down period.

11:44.161 --> 11:48.082
If y'all two got caught arguing,
I would lock y'all down too.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.794
-I'm not gonna let anybody threaten me.
-Why we hollering at me?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.629
You hollering at me,
I'm just talking to you.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.589
Yo, I'm not gonna let nobody
tell me anything,

11:55.673 --> 11:57.425
and then she was threatening me.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.678
And that's the reason
why they're split off apart, then.

12:00.761 --> 12:04.098
She jumped, said, "What you gonna do?"
So I'm like, "All right, do it."

12:13.482 --> 12:16.152
I don't know why people come
to jail to make friends.

12:16.944 --> 12:17.987
It, it-- It wasn't--

12:18.070 --> 12:19.989
I'll never grasp around the concept.

12:20.072 --> 12:23.534
I mainly stay in my cell
and read to avoid bullshit.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.954
Um, but some kind of way,
it finds me anyway.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.873
I'm not messing, like--

12:28.956 --> 12:31.375
Mischievous, yeah. Messing, no. You know?

12:31.459 --> 12:33.669
And you did admit y'all did
have a argument…

12:33.753 --> 12:37.381
-It wasn't--
-…even though she came towards you.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.716
Yeah.

12:38.799 --> 12:42.136
-I was not arguing. She was arguing.
-Okay, she had an argument with you.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.638
I've been to a couple of jails before,

12:44.722 --> 12:46.265
and all for fighting.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.476
I don't start shit, I really don't,

12:48.559 --> 12:51.270
but I got into it with a girl.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.063
And she kept pulling a knife on me.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.483
Like, I did have my days
with running up on knives.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.402
I got scars from running up on knives,

12:58.486 --> 13:02.364
but that was when I was younger and
a little bit more "not giving a fuck"-ish.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.366
So, I didn't run up on her.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.119
So I just flashed out
and started shooting at her.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.165
She ran. She didn't get hit, thank God.

13:11.248 --> 13:14.752
All right, ladies,
y'all know what time it is. Let's do it.

13:14.835 --> 13:15.878
Get moving on.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.296
It's time to lock up.

13:17.379 --> 13:18.798
Girl, what the hell now?

13:19.381 --> 13:20.382
What's up? Go.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.678
You better gobble that quick
and hurry into your cell.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.640
You got no time to finish your food.

13:27.723 --> 13:28.974
I'll just sit right here.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.185
'Cause you wait a long time to eat.
That's all on you.

13:31.268 --> 13:34.146
-You got 15 minutes to eat your food.
-I was upstairs doing something.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.106
Well, that was on you. That's on you.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.359
Don't play them games.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.780
Now you made me waste my soup.

13:43.280 --> 13:46.283
I got sentenced to four months
and three years probation.

13:47.493 --> 13:50.955
The justice system for people of color
is designed to destroy them.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.124
Once you're in the system,
it's made to keep you down.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.253
Being four months in here,
I'm not gonna lie,

13:57.336 --> 13:59.421
it had me real anxious.
Anxious to go home.

13:59.505 --> 14:03.217
It caught me at a time where I was
really trying to get things moving,

14:03.300 --> 14:05.302
like building a business,
building a empire.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.514
And I don't wanna be
a moneymaker for this system.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.891
I just wanna be a moneymaker for me.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.478
Three spoon bites,
you should be finishing with that one.

14:14.562 --> 14:18.190
I wish my children would sit down
and eat their food in three spoon bites.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.108
Thank you.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.484
Get up, ho!

14:22.570 --> 14:24.238
I have my own business.

14:24.321 --> 14:25.781
I have a lash line.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.949
It's called Pretty Savage.

14:27.032 --> 14:30.452
Right now, it's just lashes,
different strip lashes.

14:30.536 --> 14:34.498
I basically just wanna live off
my own income.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.710
I'm so ready to go get my--
get back to me.

14:38.919 --> 14:39.879
Thank you.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.384
-Juicy, she don't really mess with anyone.
-Right.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.387
She doesn't really come out
and-- out of her cell. To talk.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.805
-Right.
-To nobody.

14:49.889 --> 14:54.101
Only thing I've ever heard of her mouth is
toilet talk and the arguing with this one.

14:55.769 --> 14:56.896
And fucking herself.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.397
She-- she made a dildo.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.482
I've seen it, absolutely.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.151
I've seen it.

15:02.234 --> 15:04.737
I remember that first time
we got shook down that--

15:04.820 --> 15:06.989
-They threw that one there.
-I said, "What is that?"

15:07.072 --> 15:10.034
She made a bigger and better one, baby.
She came back with a vengeance.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.535
-Yes.

15:12.494 --> 15:16.290
You ever seen the, um,
the icicle brand, glass dildos?

15:17.124 --> 15:21.253
-No, but I got the edible underwear.
-Okay, it's solid glass.

15:21.337 --> 15:24.089
You can put it in the microwave.
You can put it in the freezer.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.091
-And then you stick it?
-Yes!

15:26.175 --> 15:27.343
-Huh!
-Yes!

15:27.426 --> 15:29.511
-So awesome.
-But it's just like the hot and the cold.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.306
Like, I've done did the thing with--
This is crazy, and I'm--

15:32.389 --> 15:33.474
Like candle wax?

15:33.557 --> 15:35.184
-Yes
-Done it.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.395
-Love it.
-Candle wax is cool as shit.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.438
Love it. Um…

15:39.521 --> 15:42.107
I'm into all kind of random shit,
you know?

15:42.191 --> 15:44.485
-Whips and chains and handcuffs, a must?
-Yeah.

15:44.568 --> 15:47.738
I can do without the handcuffs
nowadays, you feel me? But…

15:47.821 --> 15:48.948
True that.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.116
I can totally mess with you
on the streets.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.828
I'm just ready to go.
I'm ready to get out of here.

15:54.912 --> 15:55.746
Man…

15:55.829 --> 15:58.582
They throw years at us like it's months.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.716
I ain't think you really liked me.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.595
Wait, I'm sorry? Let's go backwards.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.514
I didn't think you cared for me too much.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.432
'Cause you always got
this look on your face.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.018
-She just is, um…
-But you're all right.

16:18.602 --> 16:22.064
Don't speak it because, guess what?
You know what will happen to you.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.525
-Stop it.
-I did seven years in penitentiary.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.694
-I just did seven years life.
-And what you think?

16:26.777 --> 16:29.738
I was the worst inmate,
but then I became the golden inmate.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.032
I think this should be
your last rodeo, okay?

16:32.116 --> 16:33.325
I hope so.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.535
I hope so.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.828
You have to know better.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.622
-But I'm addicted to fast money.
-No, listen.

16:38.706 --> 16:41.834
You can't change where you've been,
but you can change where you're going.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.127
You get wiser.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.714
Yeah, you see all this gray hair?
That's wisdom, baby, wisdom.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.883
My nickname is "Shortie"

16:49.967 --> 16:53.929
because I'm short, and I never grew
since I was about 12 years old.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.890
I'm 4'9,

16:56.974 --> 16:58.809
but on my license, I got 5'0.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.145
I had to even it out.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.360
Born and raised here, my whole life.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.863
They got nice neighborhoods,
and bad neighborhoods.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.657
The bad neighborhoods,
I would expect you to stay away from

17:13.741 --> 17:15.367
because if you don't, you will get got.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.119
I came from a good family, but

17:17.202 --> 17:19.913
once we moved to the Ninth Ward,
the Lower Ninth Ward,

17:19.997 --> 17:21.290
everything went to hell.

17:23.542 --> 17:28.297
I'm 31 years old, and I spent about
a good 15 years of my life in jail.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.217
I'm in here for four simple burglaries,

17:32.301 --> 17:34.344
illegal possession of stolen goods,

17:34.428 --> 17:37.806
a theft, and a warrant for
St. Bernard Parish for theft.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.808
I'd been cutting up,
going to people's houses,

17:39.892 --> 17:41.852
and I finally got caught.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.979
I lost a finger and everything
within the last year.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.733
I cut it on a fence, jumping the fence,
running from the police.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.320
But they say at least
I got to keep my 'thug'.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.493
Let me see,
let me see, let me see…

18:00.996 --> 18:02.581
Yes, I am gay.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.708
I love women.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.668
-Where you going?
-Get my stuff.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.836
I'm coming with you.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.130
Getting away from me. I'm not playing.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.216
So you don't want me no more?

18:12.299 --> 18:14.134
-Jamie, you are…

18:14.218 --> 18:17.054
-For real!
-That's my friend. My good friend.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.350
But it's just friendly flirting,
like casual, you know.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.684
How old are you?

18:22.768 --> 18:24.436
Oh, you like girls?

18:24.520 --> 18:25.813
-Oh, all right.
-Jamie!

18:25.896 --> 18:28.899
I flirt with the inmates sometimes,
but not with the officers.

18:28.982 --> 18:30.609
You need to keep your hair like that.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.361
It look good.

18:36.490 --> 18:39.243
I'm used to being locked up.
I'm used to the lifestyle on the streets.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.286
I'm used to fast money,
to running real wild.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.205
I'm used to doing what I want,
so it's like…

18:43.288 --> 18:44.248
How can I put it?

18:44.331 --> 18:46.375
I'm comfortable here, like…

18:46.458 --> 18:49.461
The ranks here?
Like, Captain Ross and all them?

18:49.545 --> 18:51.713
They knew me since I was 17 years old.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.633
How you doing, Captain Ross?
You wanna go see pictures of my baby?

18:54.716 --> 18:56.176
No, not right now.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.720
I know that I ain't supposed to say this,
but it's like family,

18:58.804 --> 19:00.430
more than my own family.

19:01.014 --> 19:01.849
You cleaned up?

19:01.932 --> 19:03.058
I told you I'd do it.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.060
Let me see. Let me see if you cleaned up.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.061
I did, but…

19:06.145 --> 19:07.688
Jamie, no. No.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.064
I want you to clean up.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.400
Jamie, this is not how
you supposed to be living.

19:12.818 --> 19:16.321
I think if they gave me, like, a six-month
to a year program in rehab,

19:16.405 --> 19:17.739
something might work out for me.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.160
If all this went away,

19:21.243 --> 19:23.996
I'd try to be a successful criminal
for the rest of my life.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.832
Normally, it's only a few months.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.584
And then I get caught.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.383
-Let me ask you this.
-What you say, girl?

19:36.508 --> 19:39.219
How you know if these cameras are on,
these body cams y'all be wearing?

19:39.303 --> 19:40.971
-I don't have a body cam on.
-No, not you.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.390
I'm just saying period.
How you know if the deputy got it on?

19:43.473 --> 19:44.600
Thank you.

19:44.683 --> 19:46.935
Why-- We don't tell you that.
What's wrong with you?

19:47.019 --> 19:49.271
-How you know we have it on?
-Yeah.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.814
It's on all the time.

19:50.898 --> 19:53.192
Well, all right, um,
I'm not saying nothing.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.985
-Why?
-Sometimes, we put it on.

19:55.068 --> 19:58.071
Girl, I'm not about to confide in y'all,
and it be on camera.

19:58.155 --> 20:01.033
And still steal something.

20:01.116 --> 20:01.992
No, ma'am.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.911
I tell y'all a lot of shit. Oh, no.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.497
Y'all know I see everything
and hear everything.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.832
Oh, I already knew.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.251
That's why I'm gonna go
behind my closed doors.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.757
Bartholomew!

20:18.884 --> 20:19.968
Press that button.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.386
Let it go.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.430
Oh, man, no!

20:23.513 --> 20:24.765
-Toilet talking.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.895
You already know I did.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.355
Talking, huh?

20:31.438 --> 20:33.565
If I catch it, I do flush the toilet.

20:35.025 --> 20:37.069
For a person to have their head
in that toilet bowl

20:37.152 --> 20:39.279
just does something to my soul.
Like, "Wait, what?"

20:39.363 --> 20:40.656
Hello?

20:40.739 --> 20:42.407
You know I didn't hear you.
What you say?

20:42.491 --> 20:44.326
-Wait, what?
-What you doing?

20:44.409 --> 20:46.036
Oh, the toilet talking?

20:46.119 --> 20:48.580
I was like, "What?" I couldn't believe it.

20:48.664 --> 20:49.498
Whatcha doin'?

20:50.832 --> 20:51.833
Who this is?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.336
This is like how I get through basically.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.880
This is that extra little,

20:56.964 --> 20:58.215
umph to my day.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.841
This our phone right here.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.677
-You just…

21:01.760 --> 21:02.678
That's the ringer.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.388
What are you doing now?

21:04.471 --> 21:05.681
Pumping the toilet out.

21:05.764 --> 21:09.059
I take the end of my mattress,
I put it on top of the toilet,

21:09.142 --> 21:11.687
and I just push my knee
into it repeatedly.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.648
-And so, it like drains the water.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.192
And then

21:17.276 --> 21:19.820
I just made a little mic.

21:19.903 --> 21:22.656
Talk in the toilet, and then
listen for a response.

21:22.739 --> 21:24.366
Talk in the toilet, listen for a response.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.742
What's popping, lovies?

21:25.826 --> 21:28.370
Ooh, that's like my best friend. Oh!

21:28.453 --> 21:30.247
Best friend!

21:31.248 --> 21:34.793
Also, the down part of this is
I have to pee in the sink.

21:34.876 --> 21:37.671
So we don't want put our people on hold…

21:37.754 --> 21:40.966
Well, they on hold, but they not on hold.
And we don't wanna have to pump back out.

21:41.049 --> 21:42.467
So we just get up…

21:43.760 --> 21:45.387
And then, we just…

21:45.971 --> 21:47.389
sit down.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.100
Piss.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.811
It's like, I didn't have
to get off the phone.

21:52.894 --> 21:55.522
The first time I saw
somebody do it, I was like,

21:55.605 --> 21:58.317
"What are y'all doing?" They're like,
"We're talking to boys."

21:58.400 --> 22:01.737
I was like, "Talking to boys?
I wanna talk to some boys down there."

22:01.820 --> 22:02.988
Hey, bae!

22:03.071 --> 22:05.490
Everybody in here basically
has a toilet boyfriend.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.658
What's up?

22:06.742 --> 22:07.909
Listen!

22:07.993 --> 22:09.536
I love you so much!

22:09.619 --> 22:10.829
I love you too.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.831
Once I got in there, I never got out.

22:12.914 --> 22:16.460
It was the f-- They're so funny there.
They're like real comedians.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.629
I love that toilet bowl girl!

22:20.797 --> 22:22.090
I love you.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.010
I love him. Like, I have love for him.

22:25.093 --> 22:29.056
Even though I have no idea
what Dale looks like.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.640
Not a clue.

22:31.558 --> 22:35.354
They do it throughout the whole day.
At night, noon, morning.

22:35.437 --> 22:38.148
-Throughout the whole day.
-What you doing?

22:39.483 --> 22:41.151
Don't get involved in that, hear?

22:41.234 --> 22:44.446
Some of them fall in love
with each other's guys, so,

22:44.529 --> 22:46.656
then it cause a fight or altercation.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.908
Don't lie.

22:47.991 --> 22:51.203
I'm not lying. When we get
out of the toilet, I flush my toilet.

22:51.286 --> 22:54.373
Like, I don't… talk to nobody.

22:54.456 --> 22:58.001
You know I don't play no games with you,
D-boy, ever, okay?

22:58.085 --> 23:02.339
I talk to a boy named D-boy.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.049
You don't want these boys in here.

23:04.132 --> 23:07.344
You want a boy that's in college, okay?

23:09.054 --> 23:11.807
Man, just sit right there,
I'm gonna be back!

23:11.890 --> 23:12.766
Oh, all right.

23:13.850 --> 23:18.522
That is my future husband,
and his name is Brian Wade.

23:19.189 --> 23:22.067
I call him Fu-Fu, and

23:22.150 --> 23:24.778
yeah, we just started talking
through the toilet.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.912
You know who should be on lockdown
and who shouldn't be on lockdown.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.706
I should not be on lockdown.
I don't feel like I should be on lockdown.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.291
-At all?
-No.

23:38.375 --> 23:43.130
I'm in a lockdown cell because I wanted
to like, fight and all this other stuff.

23:43.755 --> 23:47.300
Lockdown sucks. You can't get
no commissary or anything.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.096
I've been trying to, like,
mind my business and stay in my lane.

23:52.639 --> 23:54.683
Me being from Memphis, like…

23:54.766 --> 23:56.977
They know that I'm not from here,

23:57.060 --> 24:01.022
so I'm really not gonna have people
that come behind me, like they do.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.150
They see you're not
gonna stand your ground,

24:03.233 --> 24:05.485
they're gonna feel like
they can do whatever to you.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.363
You dumb as a box of rocks.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.490
I'm not even talking to you, girl!

24:10.574 --> 24:12.909
I'm not even talking about you.
You is an non-factor.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.911
You is irrelevant.
I'm not even worried about you.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.204
Get some help.

24:18.540 --> 24:23.044
They feel like they can, like,
take your stuff, tell you what to do, wh--

24:23.128 --> 24:26.381
Like, if they feel like they can run you,
it's over with for you.

24:27.257 --> 24:30.886
After being in here and meeting
a lot of people that I've met in here,

24:30.969 --> 24:34.264
I don't think I would ever care
to come back here in my life.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.932
-Where?
-New Orleans.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.101
This is, like, just the most…

24:38.935 --> 24:41.104
messed-up city I've ever been to.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.441
New Orleans.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.359
Orleans.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.361
How can I describe it?

24:49.946 --> 24:51.406
It's a beautiful place.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.702
I love New Orleans.
I would never leave this city.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.123
They say the city
that never sleeps is New York.

25:00.207 --> 25:03.335
Those bars shut down at two
in the morning. Ours stay open 24/7.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.755
Seven o'clock in the morning,
you can walk in on a Sunday, get a beer.

25:07.255 --> 25:11.760
You have fun when them type
of festivities going on and all that.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.679
But it's also like a breeding ground

25:14.763 --> 25:18.183
for all type of fucked up shit to happen.

25:22.312 --> 25:25.982
With the tourists coming down here,
oh, that's an easy target. Easy money.

25:26.608 --> 25:29.528
You can bump into 'em and take their
wallet and go about your business.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.030
That's the easiest crime ever.

25:32.113 --> 25:33.740
And 75% of the time, you don't get caught.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.118
'Cause they don't know who did it,
they're so drunk.

25:38.995 --> 25:40.664
I was always into the drug life.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.332
We grew up on a bayou.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.709
My daddy is a commercial fisherman.

25:44.793 --> 25:46.628
Shrimp and crab and oyster and--

25:46.711 --> 25:49.422
That's us. I made damn good money.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.799
Damn good money. But

25:50.882 --> 25:52.133
it just ain't enough.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.220
You know, when you drugging,
it's never enough.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.807
New Orleans, to me, is very evil.

25:59.349 --> 26:02.811
I don't know, I guess it's the evil
voodoo spirits or something.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.356
"Police harassment
happens all the time in my city."

26:06.439 --> 26:10.026
"Mental illness, poor curriculum,
which forces this predicament,

26:10.110 --> 26:12.237
fables of stray bullets and
citizens' cries,

26:12.320 --> 26:14.406
beefing over territories
neither yours nor mine."

26:15.490 --> 26:18.743
I can't seem to get away from it.
I feel like I, um--

26:18.827 --> 26:19.953
I'm supposed to be there.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.916
Well, you're here.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.210
Oh, yeah, I'm here all right.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.796
I mean, it's really just like a cesspool.

26:31.172 --> 26:35.594
But I love my city though,
and uh, I wouldn't trade it for the world.

26:39.014 --> 26:41.099
Ladies, day room.
Come out for day room.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.268
Come on.

26:43.351 --> 26:45.645
-You gotta move, let's move.
-I'm not moving.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.525
Let's go, ladies, come on.

26:51.276 --> 26:53.903
There's a game we need to play,
it's called "Never Have I Ever".

26:53.987 --> 26:57.407
It's like, you put your hands up,
and you say something you never did.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.159
If you did it, put your finger down.

26:59.242 --> 27:01.578
And whoever go out first, loses.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.288
Wait, what?

27:05.206 --> 27:07.375
Never have I ever

27:07.459 --> 27:09.919
been with more
than one person at one time.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.171
Uh…

27:11.254 --> 27:12.672
I know you lying.

27:12.756 --> 27:14.132
No, I'm not lying.

27:14.215 --> 27:16.134
-Yeah, you lying.
-Oh, you little liar!

27:18.011 --> 27:20.722
-We can't play if we're not playing right.
-Right, you lying.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.599
I don't think I need to play this.

27:22.682 --> 27:24.267
Okay, fuck y'all.

27:24.851 --> 27:27.437
Never have I ever had a fetish.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.273
I got a thing for big lips.
Is that like a fetish?

27:30.357 --> 27:31.441
That would be a fetish.

27:31.524 --> 27:32.984
-I love big lips.
-All right.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.238
Whoever cheated
on a person they were with?

27:37.322 --> 27:38.490
Psh, down.

27:41.576 --> 27:43.995
…ever had sex with someone
old enough to be my dad.

27:44.079 --> 27:47.123
I had sex with someone old enough
to be my mom. Does that count?

27:47.207 --> 27:48.208
-Yeah.

27:48.291 --> 27:50.126
-Not my dad!
-I'm down too.

27:50.210 --> 27:52.087
-Let me say something.
-All right.

27:52.170 --> 27:53.713
Ever had anal sex?

27:53.797 --> 27:55.173
Are you sweating, Magen?

27:55.256 --> 27:57.300
-Yes, bitch.
-All right.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.635
You're lying.

28:01.096 --> 28:02.347
Next question!

28:02.430 --> 28:03.890
Never have I ever

28:03.973 --> 28:07.018
had a threesome
with the same sex as me,

28:07.102 --> 28:08.395
so two females.

28:08.478 --> 28:09.312
Hmm.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.690
-Damn, I wish I did.
-I had it. Wait…

28:12.440 --> 28:13.441
Wait…

28:15.652 --> 28:17.362
I got two fucking fingers, uh-uh.

28:17.946 --> 28:19.614
Bitch, you missing a finger!

28:52.105 --> 28:53.982
Gotta stay fresh, you know.

29:12.792 --> 29:15.003
That look like a chicken patty to me.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.380
What that is?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.884
That's something different.

29:20.967 --> 29:24.345
Oh, shit. I left my cookie back there.
I need to pick that bitch up.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.682
You know, they feed us here, you know,

29:27.766 --> 29:29.392
and it's disgusting!

29:29.476 --> 29:31.352
It's like… Uh-uh!

29:31.436 --> 29:34.689
Girl, no. I'm sorry.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.941
That's why I'm trying
to get my commissary.

29:37.776 --> 29:41.654
Commissary, and it's necessary too,
'cause I don't eat everything.

29:45.074 --> 29:46.159
Come on now.

29:46.993 --> 29:50.663
Commissary today. And guess what,
today we're gonna have a good day.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.338
Store, canteen, commissary.

29:58.421 --> 30:02.383
It's whenever we get to go and,
and pick regular world--

30:02.467 --> 30:04.135
We call it "the world", "the world food".

30:06.763 --> 30:10.183
Their family will order, they can order
from the outside world and get sent here.

30:10.266 --> 30:12.435
Who puts money on your books?
How do you pay commissary?

30:12.519 --> 30:13.353
My daddy.

30:13.436 --> 30:16.105
My mom puts money, or somebody
puts money on my commissary.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.357
have a great man.

30:17.440 --> 30:21.152
Justin puts money on my books.
I used to get 300 dollar stores.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.197
They able to order 300 dollars
of commissary per week.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.199
We get coffee, we get snacks.

30:26.282 --> 30:28.660
Food, dill pickles.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.662
Tootsie Pops good, 25 cents.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.247
You order like nine of them.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.248
T-shirts.

30:33.331 --> 30:35.917
They got hygienes and all that.
I like to order the…

30:36.000 --> 30:37.585
Lever 2000.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.921
I'm talking about shampoos, soap,

30:40.004 --> 30:41.214
it's just personals.

30:44.050 --> 30:47.512
Anything and everything you want
is there, readily available.

30:47.595 --> 30:50.390
Very expensive, though. Very expensive.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.726
-You mean, that Reeses for the cake?
-Yeah, that's for the cake.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.562
-Thank you, fair mama.
-You're welcome, baby.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.021
Commissary is like cash.

30:57.105 --> 30:59.440
You feel on top of the world
when you get your commissary.

30:59.524 --> 31:00.400
It's money.

31:00.900 --> 31:01.985
It's all about money.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.611
Wait, and the candy bar.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.113
Thank you.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.364
Hey, we good?

31:06.447 --> 31:07.282
Yeah!

31:07.782 --> 31:11.160
We're not supposed to trade,
but, oh, well.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.829
Jamie, how'd you get that?

31:12.912 --> 31:13.997
Don't worry about that now.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.874
I'm gonna incriminate myself.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.835
-Cellmate Himber!
-I'm right here.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.963
-Thank you.
-You supposed to take your medicine there.

31:22.046 --> 31:23.965
So I just have some coffee, some noodles,

31:24.048 --> 31:25.341
and some sweets.

31:25.425 --> 31:27.218
I'm happy. It's like payday.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.469
Jasmine!

31:29.178 --> 31:32.223
I been on lockdown, right?
I couldn't get my commissary.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.809
So what I did was,
I was trying to beat the system,

31:34.893 --> 31:38.354
and I put the money on Jamie's books,

31:38.438 --> 31:40.398
and I told her she could order

31:40.481 --> 31:42.567
like $5 worth of stuff for doing it.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.405
You wanna save your CMTs, too.

31:48.364 --> 31:50.033
I'm about to go get my commissaries.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.578
Fuck yeah.

31:53.661 --> 31:56.080
Secure the bag, yo.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.874
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

32:00.209 --> 32:02.503
Oh, Jamie. I'm about to get all my shit.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.631
What you doing, bitch?
That's mine. My money.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.716
Man, why you just lying?

32:06.799 --> 32:08.843
You ain't getting nothin'.
That was my money.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.971
GIve me my stuff.
You don't do no crackhead shit like that.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.937
What you gonna do, make a big scene,
bitch? You can't do nothin'.

32:21.105 --> 32:25.193
Shorty thinks it's her stuff
because she a bum.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.362
She used to taking people's shit.

32:27.445 --> 32:29.572
Today, she's trying to say
she put money on my books,

32:29.656 --> 32:31.658
but you did not put money
on my books, ma'am.

32:31.741 --> 32:33.451
That money was mine. My family brought it.

32:35.203 --> 32:38.081
You asked me to order you
a few things, I told you no.

32:38.164 --> 32:41.125
Well, at first I did tell her yeah,
then I was like, "Nah, I can't do it."

32:41.209 --> 32:43.544
She this little and this big.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.589
Girl, I will beat the fuck out of you.
Don't play with me.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.425
Hey, bitch, you can never
punk Jamie, bitch.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.802
I might be 4'9,

32:50.885 --> 32:53.429
but I stand a giant in my mind,
you understand?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.310
She's on my law now.

32:59.394 --> 33:00.520
Ain't no money gone.

33:02.897 --> 33:04.732
The whole shysty shit she did,

33:04.816 --> 33:07.360
I'm tired of seeing people
doing that fake shit.

33:07.443 --> 33:08.277
Yeah.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.490
That girl don't even make no store.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.283
You really don't want…

33:14.367 --> 33:16.744
I'm not worrying about nothin'
nobody talkin' 'bout.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.704
Fuck you.

33:17.787 --> 33:19.247
Who you-- You talkin' to me?

33:19.330 --> 33:20.623
I'm talking to whoever.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.042
Oh, no, I'm asking you,
is you talking to me?

33:23.126 --> 33:24.544
I'm talking to all three y'all.

33:24.627 --> 33:25.628
All three y'all.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.964
What you gotta do with anything?
Who you is?

33:28.047 --> 33:29.507
Nobody?

33:29.590 --> 33:32.343
Like, who does she think she is? Like…

33:33.720 --> 33:35.763
I'm going there
'cause she want some.

33:36.514 --> 33:39.392
-Like…
-No, it ain't us! It's not us.

33:39.475 --> 33:41.477
Who you-- Who you is?

33:43.187 --> 33:44.147
Let's go!

33:44.230 --> 33:46.524
Okay, you about to go on lockdown!

33:49.402 --> 33:51.279
-Back to your cell!

33:51.362 --> 33:54.157
Like, she doing all that for what?

33:54.240 --> 33:56.034
Who she talking of?

33:56.117 --> 33:59.120
-Open that door.
-Go back, cooperate. In your cell.

33:59.203 --> 34:00.621
You stupid, dumb bitch.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.749
All right.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.751
She narcing us out.

34:04.834 --> 34:08.421
I apologize for the situation
that y'all are in right now.

34:08.504 --> 34:11.507
But this is the situation,
and I just want my stuff.

34:11.591 --> 34:12.925
-I'm so mad right now.
-So look--

34:13.009 --> 34:17.096
-So, how much was the, you know--
-It was like, $88 exactly.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.639
-My money ain't funny.
-Who put--

34:18.723 --> 34:21.184
-My money ain't funny--
-This ain't about your money being put.

34:21.267 --> 34:22.852
-You put $88…
-I wanted what I wanted!

34:22.935 --> 34:25.897
-…on somebody else's account, though?
-Yeah! I wanted what I wanted.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.774
I just wanna know one thing.

34:28.566 --> 34:29.609
What's your involvement?

34:29.692 --> 34:31.360
-She started this.
-I wanna know what role--

34:31.444 --> 34:32.904
I don't want-- Tell me the truth.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.449
She was supposed
to bring me half the stuff.

34:36.532 --> 34:37.784
So why did you do that?

34:37.867 --> 34:39.702
She was supposed
to break me off half the store.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.454
-She said five dollars!
-No!

34:41.537 --> 34:43.414
At first, it was supposed to be half.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.666
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

34:45.750 --> 34:47.919
Then she went down to $5.
That's why she got jacked.

34:48.002 --> 34:49.337
Oh, so you robbed her.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.756
No! I ain't robbed her,
but it is what it is.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.758
I'm from the Nine, and I don't mind dyin'.

34:53.841 --> 34:56.761
That's the Lower 9th Ward slang.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.096
Cutthroat committee.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.222
For snacks?

34:59.305 --> 35:00.223
For snacks.

35:02.725 --> 35:03.851
You feel me, Miss Steele?

35:03.935 --> 35:06.813
No, oh no, she's not feeling you.
Ain't no laughing this end.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.898
-Do you feel her?
-I don't know.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.691
We're gonna have to do something quick,

35:10.775 --> 35:13.152
because she already gave
the whole thing to me.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.362
Okay…

35:16.030 --> 35:19.200
Take-- Tell Harley,
take all the coffee out. Hurry up!

35:20.076 --> 35:21.744
Man…

35:21.828 --> 35:23.621
They blowin' this thing.

35:26.249 --> 35:28.209
Take all the coffee out.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.086
Back up.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.629
Open up on 16.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.297
Where that commissary?

35:33.381 --> 35:35.133
-Right there under my bed.
-Give it here.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.260
-Give it here, everything.
-Hey, please!

35:39.512 --> 35:43.349
Don't come to this table
unless I call you. Now back up.

35:43.432 --> 35:46.060
No, 'cause some of my stuff in her bag,
too, 'cause that's my friend.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.437
You heard. I'm dealing with something.
You better back up.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.273
-All right.
-This ain't what you want.

35:51.899 --> 35:54.485
Oh, Miss Picard!

35:55.153 --> 35:57.113
I think we should have
a discussion about this.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.573
-Yeah, 'cause she--
-Hold!

35:58.656 --> 36:01.909
If y'all say one word,
I'm gonna deal with y'all.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.331
What are we gonna do?

36:07.415 --> 36:10.084
-Everything is here.
-We could just send all this stuff back.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.669
-Huh?
-Send everything back.

36:11.752 --> 36:12.587
Yep.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.921
'Cause guess why.

36:14.005 --> 36:17.425
She lied to manipulate the system,
because she was on lockdown.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.468
She took it in. So send it all back.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.097
Tell her to take the hold off that door.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.807
-Huh?
-Now nobody ain't gettin'.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.976
-Deputy!
-That's how we gonna do this.

36:27.059 --> 36:28.728
-That's my bag!
-Can I get my shit?

36:28.811 --> 36:30.605
You gonna be all right.

36:33.774 --> 36:36.444
Yeah, bring me my shit, please!

36:37.737 --> 36:39.155
Fuck her, I want some!

36:39.238 --> 36:41.908
-I just say it's commissary day.
-It's commissary day.

36:41.991 --> 36:44.202
Commissary day. It always happens.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.078
Chaos.

36:47.121 --> 36:49.332
They mad. They big mad. But guess what.

36:49.415 --> 36:52.919
We all on lockdown rules.
Y'all ain't accomplished nothin'.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.672
I was like, "Where my shit?!"

36:56.756 --> 36:58.424
She said, "Oh, I ain't got it."

36:58.507 --> 37:00.384
Hey! I'm fuckin' with that!

37:02.345 --> 37:03.221
Come here!

37:04.430 --> 37:06.682
No, I want her moved out
to Cell 9 at the top,

37:06.766 --> 37:09.644
'cause all she do is talk to Fu all day.
She ain't about to be comfortable.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.188
You had a chance to talk.
You didn't tell me the truth.

37:12.271 --> 37:13.564
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

37:13.648 --> 37:16.025
She not about to be comfortable
talking to that toilet bowl!

37:16.108 --> 37:19.237
Toilet, I don't wanna hear about that.
I'm talkin' 'bout the commissary, Jamie.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.697
I talk 'bout her! She about to be
on lockdown and comfortable.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.241
No, ma'am. I'mma make her miserable.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.159
-What?
-Huh?

37:25.243 --> 37:26.285
So that's a threat?

37:26.369 --> 37:28.162
-No!
-That's 30 days.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.415
-Guess what, you just made a threat.
-No, ma'am, I'm sayin', like,

37:31.499 --> 37:33.834
she got Fu on that toilet
and she got me jonesin' all day,

37:33.918 --> 37:36.212
-she ain't 'bout to be comfortable!
-So you made a threat.

37:36.295 --> 37:38.756
No, I'm just sayin',
like that's fucked up!

37:38.839 --> 37:41.342
-That's my thing. She got--
-That could get somebody hurt.

37:41.425 --> 37:44.470
But Fu is the one
bucking her up to do everything!

37:44.971 --> 37:48.099
But, Jamie, guess what, though.
You lied to me at first.

37:48.182 --> 37:50.351
But at the end of the day,
Ms. Picard, this is jail.

37:50.434 --> 37:51.435
We are criminals!

37:52.687 --> 37:54.397
How are you?

37:57.358 --> 37:59.318
Yo, listen.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.654
I need-- I need a moment,

38:01.737 --> 38:03.281
'cause, check this out.

38:03.906 --> 38:06.409
My attitude right now
is just, like, fuck it,

38:06.492 --> 38:08.911
and I'm not trying to take it out on you.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.789
I've been in here 11 months now.

38:11.872 --> 38:13.457
And I just…

38:13.541 --> 38:15.501
I don't want no dealings with it.

38:15.584 --> 38:17.503
I just wanna go home.

38:17.586 --> 38:18.879
Back to Memphis.

38:19.422 --> 38:21.007
It's definitely lonely, like,

38:21.090 --> 38:23.968
being here without nobody down here.

38:24.051 --> 38:27.013
And the toilet-talking. It's, like,

38:27.096 --> 38:28.806
it just makes the time go by fast,

38:28.889 --> 38:32.310
and it makes you forget about
some of the stuff you're going through.

38:35.521 --> 38:38.566
She's on a pretty, you know, bad charge.

38:38.649 --> 38:39.942
It's

38:40.484 --> 38:43.237
a big trial that's coming up, uh,

38:43.321 --> 38:47.241
so I don't think I'm gonna be able
to tell y'all, like, details or anything.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.166
Basically, some things happened,

38:55.249 --> 38:57.877
and I ended up in here on a murder charge.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.846
Uh, yeah.

39:08.929 --> 39:11.182
-I don't know what else. 
-Okay!

39:11.265 --> 39:12.850
Let's go back a little bit.
