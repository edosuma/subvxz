MORAN: Private journal
of Captain Jonathan Moran.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.719
21 st November, 21 1 9.

00:11.840 --> 00:15.559
We have located a craft
of unknown origin on the lake floor.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.999
Visual scans in situ revealed nothing.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.999
So, we have brought the craft on-board

00:21.080 --> 00:23.799
and myself and the crew
will now investigate.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.879
MORAN: How did they miss this
in the initial survey?

00:34.800 --> 00:36.399
Cass says it was buried.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.759
And the currents of the water
must have shifted the rubble around.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.519
Conversation needs to be had
about who owns this spaceship.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.319
MORAN: Can we stop
calling it a spaceship?

00:46.000 --> 00:46.999
We don't know what it is.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.479
PRITCHARD: A case could be made
that this is an asset

00:49.560 --> 00:51.599
and my company has bought
the rights to all assets...

00:51.680 --> 00:52.679
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.959
What's this?

00:55.600 --> 00:57.639
Lunn, grab me a torch, will you?

00:57.880 --> 01:02.439
It was found on MOD property,
even if that property is underwater.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.879
MORAN: Lunn, where's the torch?

01:28.640 --> 01:29.639
Can I go in?

01:30.040 --> 01:32.079
What is the, uh, radiation count?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.799
PRITCHARD: Pretty much background level.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.599
Anything more it would have shown up
in the initial survey 20 years ago.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.839
If it's not safe,
how come you can go in?

01:41.600 --> 01:42.719
How long do you think
it's been down here?

01:42.800 --> 01:44.959
Well, there's next to no corrosion.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.639
-I've not seen technology like this...
-Please, don't say "On Earth".

01:48.720 --> 01:50.879
-...on Earth before.
-(SIGHS) Oh.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.119
-(CHUCKLES)
-Maybe it's some kind

01:52.200 --> 01:53.319
of experimental craft

01:53.400 --> 01:55.519
that got left behind
when they abandoned the site.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.319
Wait, you think the army
would just lose a prototype weapon?

01:58.880 --> 02:01.079
You're new to the military
aren't you, son?

02:02.480 --> 02:03.479
BENNETT: Cass says he might be right.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.759
It might have been here since the 1 980s,
before the valley flooded.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.039
Cass!

02:12.320 --> 02:13.519
(BEEPING)

02:14.720 --> 02:15.799
(SCREAMS)

02:16.120 --> 02:17.279
LUNN: Come on!

02:18.120 --> 02:20.239
-Move!
-LUNN: Come on! We have to go now!

02:24.080 --> 02:25.639
TANNOY: Fire in main hangar.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.839
Safety protocols have been initiated.

02:28.920 --> 02:31.119
All crew must evacuate immediately.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.439
This safety message was
brought to you by Vector Petroleum.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.079
We can't just leave him in there!

02:36.160 --> 02:37.759
There's something in the spaceship.
I saw it!

02:37.840 --> 02:39.919
O'Donnell. O'Donnell, he's dead.
Didn't you see him?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.479
Are we... The fire,
are we safe out here?

02:41.560 --> 02:43.039
It's fine,
the CO2 will put the fire out.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.279
It was you!

02:44.360 --> 02:46.479
You were messing about
with the controls on that ship!

02:47.720 --> 02:48.959
(SCREAMS)

02:52.600 --> 02:53.839
Moran.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.079
We just saw you...

02:56.160 --> 02:59.279
He's... Oh, my God.

03:00.760 --> 03:02.919
He's a ghost.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.799
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

03:51.880 --> 03:53.639
(WHOOSHING)

04:00.920 --> 04:03.479
What's wrong? You're not happy.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.759
Why aren't you happy? Tell me.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.039
CLARA: Come on, we're on a roll!

04:09.520 --> 04:11.439
Monsters, things blowing up.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.359
Oh, hey, can we go back to that place

04:13.440 --> 04:14.599
where the people
with the long necks have been

04:14.680 --> 04:16.239
celebrating New Year for two centuries?

04:16.920 --> 04:18.759
I left my sunglasses there.

04:18.840 --> 04:20.919
And most of my dignity.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.919
DOCTOR: Why have you brought us here?

04:25.280 --> 04:26.439
(EXHALES) Here, being?

04:30.120 --> 04:31.519
Underwater.

04:32.920 --> 04:34.759
Some sort of a base.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.119
Technology's 22nd century.

04:37.200 --> 04:39.839
Maybe military. Maybe scientific.

04:40.360 --> 04:41.359
Is there a crew?

04:42.080 --> 04:44.279
Must be. Somewhere. There's oxygen.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.519
(SIGHING) I want another adventure.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.719
Come on, you feel the same.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.839
You're itching to save
a planet, I know it.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.959
Doctor, look at this.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.639
Well, looks like you got your wish.

05:08.840 --> 05:09.839
CLARA: Food fight?

05:09.920 --> 05:11.479
DOCTOR: I think there was
more to it than that.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.599
Whatever it was,
it happened pretty recently.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.839
Seven or eight hours ago.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.319
No bodies, though.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.519
And they took provisions.

05:23.680 --> 05:28.839
OK, so, something or someone
forced the crew to abandon the base.

05:29.400 --> 05:32.079
Maybe they went for a swim
in the creepy,

05:32.160 --> 05:33.599
flooded village outside.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.639
Oh, yeah, you see, this is more like it.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.479
Well, come on. Don't leave me hanging.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.359
Look, told you.

05:58.320 --> 05:59.319
Crew.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.039
Hello, sailors.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.359
Right, did not expect that.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.959
Hands up, who expected that.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.399
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't think they're going to hurt us.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.199
I think that they're just curious.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.999
You sure?

06:28.080 --> 06:30.839
Well, I mean, define "sure".

06:32.200 --> 06:35.079
Look at you, lovely chaps.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.919
What's happened to you, then?

06:44.440 --> 06:45.439
Come on.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.199
CLARA: What are they?

06:50.520 --> 06:53.119
DOCTOR: I haven't a clue.
Isn't that exciting?

07:00.840 --> 07:02.079
Where did they go?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.479
What is it, some kind of submarine?

07:07.560 --> 07:08.759
No, it's alien.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.279
DOCTOR: That's weird.
The Tardis hasn't translated it.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.639
(WHOOSHING)

07:48.320 --> 07:50.439
(WHISPERING) Hey, look! They're back.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.479
Hello, did you want to show us this?

07:58.240 --> 07:59.359
It's very nice.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.279
(INAUDIBLE)

08:03.280 --> 08:04.719
Wait, are they saying something?

08:12.360 --> 08:14.919
OK, they now appear
to be arming themselves.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.079
Yes, I spotted that too.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.319
Was it something she said?
She does that.

08:19.400 --> 08:20.919
She once had an argument with Gandhi!

08:21.680 --> 08:23.719
I'm starting to see
why the crew did a runner.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.479
(CLANKING)

08:36.720 --> 08:37.719

08:46.720 --> 08:47.719

08:51.760 --> 08:53.319
In here! Quick!

(GASPING)

09:00.880 --> 09:01.599
(INAUDIBLE)

09:07.440 --> 09:08.959
DOCTOR: What are you?

09:12.600 --> 09:15.119
Who the hell are you
and what are you doing here?

09:15.520 --> 09:16.999
This is Clara.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.359
And I'm the Doctor.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.599
-You're from UNIT.
-Well, if that's what it says.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.559
I'm Pritchard. This is Bennett.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.999
O'Donnell!

09:26.080 --> 09:28.239
(CHUCKLES) You're really the Doctor?
I'm a huge fan.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.479
(LAUGHS)

09:29.560 --> 09:34.119
Uh, I mean, um, you know, nice work.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.159
Tim Lunn, I sign for Cass.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.999
Tell me, what about
those things out there, what are they?

09:40.080 --> 09:42.039
Why are they trying to kill us?

09:42.280 --> 09:44.839
Well, they're, uh, they're ghosts.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.399
They're not ghosts.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.119
-Cass is saying a...
-Thank you,

09:48.200 --> 09:49.839
but I actually don't need your help.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.439
I can speak sign. Go ahead.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.999
Wait, no, no, actually, I can't.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.079
It's been deleted for semaphore.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.239
Someone get me a selection of flags.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.519
"One of the ghosts is our previous
commanding officer.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.879
"The other, moley-guy,
we don't know what he is."

10:13.960 --> 10:15.199
He's from the planet Tivoli.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.359
See? I told you he was an alien.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.039
Didn't I say that?

10:19.800 --> 10:21.159
Weird thing is, they're not violent.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.479
They're too cowardly.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.039
They wouldn't say boo to a goose.

10:25.120 --> 10:28.119
More like to give the goose
their car keys and bank details.

10:28.640 --> 10:29.719
When did they first appear?

10:29.800 --> 10:32.039
Oh, did you see
that spaceship in the hangar?

10:32.120 --> 10:33.559
Yeah, we found that on the lake bed.

10:33.640 --> 10:34.639
We just got it on board

10:34.720 --> 10:37.159
and one of the engines started up
and then Moran got...

10:39.240 --> 10:40.359
Moran was killed.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.399
"Then, they appeared

10:42.480 --> 10:44.559
"and pretty much straightaway
started trying to kill us.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.999
"So, we grabbed what we could
and were looking for somewhere to hide,

10:48.120 --> 10:50.759
"and that's when we realised
the ghosts couldn't come in here."

10:51.120 --> 10:53.399
-What is this place?
-It's a Faraday cage.

10:53.520 --> 10:56.119
Completely impenetrable
to radio waves and, apparently,

10:56.240 --> 10:58.679
whatever those things are out there.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.279
So, who's in charge now?

11:00.720 --> 11:03.199
-I need to know who to ignore.
-That'd be me.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.159
Her.

11:05.400 --> 11:09.079
Actually, that would be me.
I represent Vector Petroleum.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.799
-We own the mining rights to the oil.
-The oil?

11:12.800 --> 11:13.799
Where are we?

11:13.880 --> 11:16.559
Uh, this used to be
a military training site.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.759
Uh, there was a, a dam overlooking it,

11:18.840 --> 11:21.159
but the dam burst
and the valley was submerged.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.079
Then 20 years ago, we discovered
a massive oil reservoir underneath it.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.999
COMPUTER VOICE: Goodmorning.
Entering day mode.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.799
OK, it's morning.
We can go outside now.

11:28.880 --> 11:29.959
LUNN: Thank God for that.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.479
PRITCHARD: At last,
we can get out of here.

11:33.840 --> 11:34.959
Morning?

11:35.200 --> 11:37.639
Yeah, uh, we're too far below
the surface for daylight,

11:37.720 --> 11:40.199
so we have to demarcate
artificial days and nights.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.639
Um, I'd like to have
a look at that spaceship,

11:42.720 --> 11:45.039
but what about those things
that aren't ghosts?

11:45.120 --> 11:46.839
Oh, it's all right,
they only come out at night.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.319
Weird how that is not comforting.

11:55.560 --> 11:56.599
If whatever they are...

11:56.680 --> 11:57.839
-They're ghosts.
-They're not ghosts!

11:57.920 --> 12:00.079
...have been trying to kill you,
why haven't you abandoned the base?

12:00.160 --> 12:01.159
That was my call.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.719
We've got about a trillion dollars'
worth of mining equipment here.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.559
We're not just going to abandon it.

12:06.280 --> 12:08.119
What? If it all goes pear-shaped,

12:08.600 --> 12:10.199
it's not them that lose their bonus.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.239
It's OK, I understand.
You're an idiot.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.439
Come to mention it,
why is there a Faraday cage on the base?

12:20.520 --> 12:23.439
It's the, uh, mining equipment.
It runs on nuclear fission.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.319
The Faraday cage
has been lined with lead

12:25.400 --> 12:27.999
to act as a shelter
in the event of a radiation leak.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.039
So, we are fighting
an unknown homicidal force

12:31.120 --> 12:34.359
that has taken the form of your
commanding officer and a cowardly alien,

12:34.440 --> 12:37.119
underwater, in a nuclear reactor?

12:37.720 --> 12:39.839
Anything else I should know? Has someone
got a peanut allergy or something?

12:39.920 --> 12:40.919
(CHUCKLES)

12:44.040 --> 12:45.759
It all started with this ship.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.479
This is where the answer will be.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.159
What's happened
to the stuff you've removed?

13:10.200 --> 13:11.439
This is for long-haul flights.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.559
There should be
a suspended animation chamber

13:13.640 --> 13:15.279
for the pilot, right here.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.119
-Plus, a power cell is missing.
-Power cell?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.599
Yeah, you can see the casing is empty.

13:23.840 --> 13:25.159
It's not safe out here!

13:25.240 --> 13:26.639
CLARA: What's the matter?

13:26.720 --> 13:28.239
She won't let me look
inside the spaceship.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.999
-She says it's not safe.
-I'm saying it's not safe out here.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.199
I imagine they're pretty valuable.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.599
-What?
-PRITCHARD: I mean powerful.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.959
I imagine those power cells
are pretty powerful.

13:36.040 --> 13:38.399
They can zap a vessel from
one side of the galaxy to the other,

13:38.480 --> 13:40.199
so, you take
a wild stab in the dark.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.959
And the missing one
must still be out there.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.799
Yes, well, otherwise... Sorry.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.439
Why is this man still talking to me?

13:45.520 --> 13:48.119
We haven't removed anything.
There hasn't been time.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.279
DOCTOR: So what have we got?

13:51.360 --> 13:55.919
Moran dies and then those things appear.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.239
They can walk through walls.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.799
They only come out at night.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.999
And they're sort of see-through.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.159
CLARA: Doctor, wait,
you're not saying...

14:11.480 --> 14:13.519
They're ghosts.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.439
Yeah, ghosts!

14:15.520 --> 14:17.279
CLARA: You said there was no such thing.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.359
You actually pooh-poohed
the ghost theory.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.399
Yes, well... Well,
there was no such thing

14:22.480 --> 14:26.679
as socks or smart phones
and badgers until there suddenly were.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.159
Besides, what else could they be?

14:29.240 --> 14:30.439
They're not holograms.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.759
They're not Flesh Avatars.

14:31.960 --> 14:32.999
They're not Autons.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.359
They're not digital copies
bouncing around the Nethersphere.

14:36.440 --> 14:40.439
No, these people are literally,
actually dead!

14:41.400 --> 14:42.479
Wow!

14:44.600 --> 14:46.799
This is... It's amazing!

14:46.880 --> 14:48.959
I've never actually met a proper ghost!

14:49.160 --> 14:50.519
(MOUTHING)

14:52.000 --> 14:53.479
"Moran was our friend."

14:56.000 --> 14:57.199
(WHISPERING) The cards.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.599
Oh! Oh, right you are. Uh...

15:03.680 --> 15:04.679
(SIGHS) Come here.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.959
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:15.040 --> 15:16.679
I'm very sorry for your loss.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.679
I'll do all I can
to solve the death of your

15:19.760 --> 15:23.039
friend, slash family member, slash pet.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.519
But don't you see what this means?

15:32.200 --> 15:35.559
Death, it was the one thing that unified

15:35.640 --> 15:37.999
every single living creature
in the universe,

15:38.080 --> 15:39.079
and now it's gone!

15:41.720 --> 15:42.919
How can you just sit there?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.639
Don't you want
to go out there right now,

15:44.720 --> 15:46.399
wrestle them to the ground
and ask them questions

15:46.480 --> 15:47.799
until your throat falls out?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.559
What's death like? Does it hurt?

15:49.640 --> 15:50.919
Do you still get hungry?

15:51.800 --> 15:53.999
Do you miss being alive?

15:54.560 --> 15:57.879
Why can you only handle metal objects?
Oh, I didn't know I'd noticed that.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.239
OK, so they'll try
to kill you, blah, blah, blah.

16:00.320 --> 16:02.879
What does that matter? You come back!

16:02.960 --> 16:04.879
A bit murdery, sure, but even so!

16:05.600 --> 16:08.079
Calm, Doctor, calm.

16:08.160 --> 16:10.439
You were like this
when you met Shirley Bassey.

16:10.960 --> 16:11.959
OK.

16:12.600 --> 16:16.239
Question one. What is a ghost?

16:16.680 --> 16:19.279
Question two. What do they want?

16:20.440 --> 16:22.319
Whoa, whoa, what's happening?

16:25.440 --> 16:28.999
COMPUTER VOICE: Good evening.
Entering night mode.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.079
That's not right. We're switching back
into night mode again.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.279
This can't happen.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.959
No. No. No.

16:35.480 --> 16:38.119

-BENNETT: Um, what's doing that?

16:38.200 --> 16:40.119

16:43.200 --> 16:44.199
CLARA: Doctor?

16:44.840 --> 16:46.479
DOCTOR: The Tardis Cloister Bell!

16:46.560 --> 16:48.119
(BELL CONTINUES TOLLING)

16:48.200 --> 16:49.719
CLARA: Doctor, what's wrong?

16:51.960 --> 16:53.279
DOCTOR: It must be the ghosts.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.999
That's why she was upset
when we got here.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.039
Why? I don't understand.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.879
It was just what I was saying.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.559
You live and you die, that's it.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.239
The ghosts are aberrations.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.159
A splinter of time in the skin.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.799
They're unnatural.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.599
She wants to get away from them.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.079
So what do we do?

17:17.600 --> 17:19.399
Put the hand brake on.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.519
Whoa, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

17:27.600 --> 17:29.479
Where do you think you're going?

17:29.560 --> 17:31.039
Out there, where the action is.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.479
Look, um...

17:32.560 --> 17:34.919
-What?
-Oh. This is my own fault.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.399
I like adventures
as much as the next man.

17:39.480 --> 17:40.799
If the next man is a man
who likes adventures.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.239
Even so, don't... Don't go native.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.599
(CHUCKLES) What do you mean? I'm not.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.279
Look, there's a whole dimension in here.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.199
But there's only room for one me.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.359
Wait. Wait a second.

17:56.440 --> 17:59.239
You just raved about ghosts like a kid
who had too much sherbet.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.759
Do you know what you need?
You need a hobby!

18:00.840 --> 18:01.999
(LAUGHS) I really don't.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.679
DOCTOR: Or even better,
another relationship!

18:03.760 --> 18:06.359
Come on, you lot,
you're bananas about relationships.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.319
You're always writing songs about them

18:09.400 --> 18:11.639
or going to war or getting tattooed.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.959
Doctor. I'm fine.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.599
I just felt that I had to say something.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.879
I know, and I appreciated it.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.959
-'Cause I've got a duty of care.
-Which you take very seriously, I know.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.719
-So can stop now?
-Please.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.479
Please do. (CHUCKLES)

O'DONNELL: (ON PA) Attention all crew.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.599
The Drum switched to night mode early,

18:42.680 --> 18:45.239
so grab provisions
and make your way to the Faraday cage.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.319
PRITCHARD: That you, Bennett?

18:53.680 --> 18:56.599
I went out
looking for that missing power cell.

18:56.680 --> 19:00.799
OK, contractually it's a grey area,

19:00.880 --> 19:04.639
but I reckon we can argue
everything non-indigenous is an asset

19:04.720 --> 19:05.759
and therefore...

19:06.680 --> 19:08.559
(WATER DRIPPING)

19:11.080 --> 19:12.079
Bennett?

19:14.400 --> 19:15.399

Pritchard, you are unaccounted for.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.919
Contact the bridge or get to
the Faraday cage immediately.

20:00.920 --> 20:04.959
Pritchard! Contact the bridge,
or get to the Faraday cage!

20:05.040 --> 20:06.159
BENNETT: I'd love to work for UNIT.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.239
Earth's first line of defence and all.

20:09.320 --> 20:10.679
Yeah. I'm probably not suited though.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.999
Not much of a fighter.
Uh, more of a bleeder.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.919
CLARA: Pritchard! Where have you been?
Everyone's been looking for you.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.559
-What's with the wet suit?
-Yeah, where've you been?

20:24.280 --> 20:26.919
BENNETT: O'Donnell, it's OK,
Pritchard's in here!

20:27.120 --> 20:30.439
Pritchard, you moron, grab your stuff,
we're locking down early.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.639
In case I can't get this back
into day mode.

21:32.440 --> 21:33.639

21:41.560 --> 21:43.959
They're working out
how to use the base against us.

Altering the time settings
so they can go about uninhibited,

21:48.800 --> 21:50.639
opening the airlocks.

21:50.720 --> 21:51.759
They're learning.

21:52.720 --> 21:53.999
And now there's three of them?

21:55.160 --> 21:56.799
Cass, what do we do?

21:59.640 --> 22:01.079
"We abandon the base.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.599
"Topside can send down
a whole team of marines

"or Ghostbusters or whatever."

"I can't force you to leave,

"so you can stay and do the whole

"and get killed or drowned if you want.

is to protect my crew."

but we're coming back, aren't we?

we're abandoning base on my orders."

Topside, Topside,
this is Lance Corporal Alice O'Donnell

22:35.200 --> 22:36.559
from Drum Control. Over.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.959
MAN: (ON RADIO)
Drum Control, this is Topside.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.359
We have received your message,

22:40.440 --> 22:42.079
submarine on its way. Over.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.239
O'DONNELL: Repeat, Topside. Over.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.239
We've received your request
for a rescue sub,

22:46.320 --> 22:47.719
it's two minutes away. Over.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.159
Topside, who did you speak to,

22:49.240 --> 22:51.039
and when was this request made? Over.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.999
Drum Control, it was in Morse code.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.839
Arrived maybe half an hour ago.

22:54.920 --> 22:57.119
Said it was urgent, comms were down,

22:57.200 --> 22:59.039
two crew members critically ill,

22:59.120 --> 23:01.719
full paramedic team requested. Over.

Topside, this is the Doctor,

23:06.600 --> 23:07.639
You may be familiar with my work.

Call back the sub.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.399
-Doctor, why...
-DOCTOR: Call it back!

23:10.720 --> 23:13.239
We have a hazardous
and undefined contagion on board.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.959
This base is now under quarantine.

23:16.840 --> 23:18.359
What did you do that for?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.639
Well, none of us sent
the message, did we?

23:20.720 --> 23:22.119
So that means that the ghosts sent it.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.639
Which means they want
that crew down here.

23:24.720 --> 23:25.759
"Why would they do that?"

23:25.840 --> 23:27.159
Well, I don't know,
but I'm pretty certain it's not

23:27.240 --> 23:28.479
so they can all form a boy band.

23:29.240 --> 23:32.159
OK, we solve this on our own.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.319
The ghosts can only come out at night

23:33.400 --> 23:36.159
so they change the base's
time settings, why?

23:36.240 --> 23:38.599
-What's different at night?
-It's mainly atmospheric.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.919
The lights are dim,
the noise from the engines is muffled.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.439
No, something... Something else.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.439
"The diagnostic sweep,
when the systems are checked.

23:46.520 --> 23:47.799
"That stops at night to save power."

23:47.880 --> 23:49.479
What systems, specifically?

23:49.560 --> 23:51.839
Life support, the locks.
They're electromagnetic.

23:51.920 --> 23:53.639
They have to be
secured in case of flooding,

23:53.720 --> 23:56.639
so throughout the day they're checked
one by one, every few seconds.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.359
(SIGHS) The answer's
in there somewhere, I can smell it.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.079
Doctor, what do we do?

24:07.080 --> 24:09.799
O'Donnell. Excellent work.

24:10.760 --> 24:13.719
Returning the base to day mode.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.799
(SHEEPISHLY) Shut up. It was nothing.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.999
-You really think so?
-Now put it back into night mode.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.679
-What?
-We know nothing!

24:21.480 --> 24:23.239
We don't know what they want.

24:23.320 --> 24:24.599
That's what's getting us killed.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.159
Well, I won't run. Not any more.

24:27.840 --> 24:31.639
So, O'Donnell, kindly put the base
back into night mode.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.039
We want to know what
these ghosts are after,

24:34.120 --> 24:35.439
we ask them.

24:35.520 --> 24:38.599
We are going to do the impossible.
Capture a ghost.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.239
(WHIMPERING)

25:08.080 --> 25:10.959
Bennett's got them moving
and Clara's in position.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.279
Clara, Bennett is gonna run
across the top of the T-junction

25:13.360 --> 25:15.039
to your right in about ten seconds.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.719
Draw the ghosts towards you.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.679
Turn right, and then take second left.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.919
Hey! Hey, ghosts.

25:28.000 --> 25:28.999
Down here!

25:33.680 --> 25:35.559
DOCTOR: Lunn, they're coming your way.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.479
Clara's going to duck down to her left.

25:37.560 --> 25:41.439
You're gonna keep the ghosts
going on the same route they are on now.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.679
Then, after about 50 yards,
on your left there's a flood door.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.439
O'Donnell will close the door
once you're through.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.319
I... I can hear them.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.519

(GASPS)

26:04.080 --> 26:05.959
Hey. Yeah, this way.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.479
We've got a problem!

26:11.560 --> 26:12.839
They've separated.

26:13.880 --> 26:14.919
What?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.679
O'DONNELL: Moran and the mole guy
are going after Clara.

26:19.320 --> 26:21.639
O'DONNELL: Clara, look out.
Two ghosts are still on your case.

26:21.720 --> 26:22.719
Right behind you.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.239
I'm beginning to think we should have
let the ghosts in on the plan.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.399
Clara, there's a flood door
at the end of the corridor

26:30.480 --> 26:32.119
around the corner to your right.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.719
We'll close it from here.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.239
Listen to me.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.399
You've got to get through that door

26:36.480 --> 26:37.959
before Moran
and the other ghost sees you.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.639
CLARA: Doctor!

26:43.720 --> 26:45.039
DOCTOR: Now, O'Donnell! Fast as you can.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.479
(BEEPING)

26:49.320 --> 26:50.359
(CLANGING)

26:56.480 --> 26:58.199
Guys, I'm nearly at my door.

27:02.680 --> 27:03.879
Now, Lunn. Quickly.

27:10.000 --> 27:10.999
It saw me.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.399
Oh, God. It saw me.

27:16.600 --> 27:17.719
It's coming through.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.399
It's coming through the door!

27:22.360 --> 27:25.399
-We don't have a camera in there.
-Lunn, can you hear me?

27:25.480 --> 27:26.759
Can you hear me?

27:29.000 --> 27:30.319
Lunn, what's happening?

27:31.640 --> 27:33.039
(GROANS)

27:33.880 --> 27:34.879
(SHUDDERING)

27:54.160 --> 27:55.439
(CLATTERING)

27:58.440 --> 28:01.359
DOCTOR: Lunn! Can you hear me?
Lunn! Lunn!

28:01.880 --> 28:04.119
Can you hear me? Lunn! Lunn!

28:04.200 --> 28:05.879
Lunn!
What's happening? Lunn!

28:06.440 --> 28:08.439
-Lunn, can you hear me?
-I'm OK.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.879
Cass. He's alive.

28:10.960 --> 28:12.879
LUNN: It didn't hurt me. I'm OK.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.439
What? What's wrong with you?
Why didn't it hurt you?

28:15.520 --> 28:16.759
Bennett, you're on again.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.559
-Bennett, where are you?
-(BEEPING)

28:19.360 --> 28:20.359
O'DONNELL: There.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.239
Oh, God, look.

28:23.320 --> 28:24.319
Bennett, can you hear me?

28:25.000 --> 28:26.719
There are two ghosts
just around the corner from you.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.279
(WHISPERS) Yes, thanks, I'd noticed.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.199
The Faraday cage
is across the intersection

28:30.280 --> 28:31.399
and down the corridor to your right.

28:31.480 --> 28:32.999
This last bit is down to you.

28:40.800 --> 28:41.919
(GRUNTS)

28:47.600 --> 28:50.279
OK, so, the good news is
they aren't split up any more.

28:52.640 --> 28:53.839
Cue Clara!

28:58.480 --> 29:00.879
(STATIC CRACKLING)

29:05.680 --> 29:06.879
We need to talk.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.439
Sorry, chaps. Just a hologram.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.199
You play a little bit too rough.

29:20.120 --> 29:24.559
I'm fine, by the way.
In case any of you were worried.

29:24.640 --> 29:25.999
Cass, are you seeing this?

29:26.080 --> 29:29.519
O'DONNELL: Sonic glasses Wi-Fi
locked in. On screen B2.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.239
She says she can't see them properly.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.719
"The glass is too thick
and they're too far away."

29:41.080 --> 29:42.559
-Open the door.
-What?

29:43.200 --> 29:45.999
Doctor, you can't go in there.
They will kill you!

29:46.080 --> 29:48.199
They don't have any weapons
or access to any of the controls.

29:48.280 --> 29:51.399
They can't hurt me. So open the door.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.239
(BEEPING)

29:56.400 --> 29:57.719
(DOOR OPENS)

30:13.520 --> 30:15.159
(WHISPERS) Cold...

30:16.240 --> 30:17.319
(NORMAL VOICE) ..isn't it?

30:17.400 --> 30:19.919
Take your weapons away
and you're not so scary, are you?

30:20.800 --> 30:21.959
That better, Cass?

30:28.240 --> 30:30.439
She says they're saying the same thing,

30:30.520 --> 30:32.439
the same phrase, over and over.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.959
They're saying,

30:37.040 --> 30:39.959
"The dark... The score...

30:41.040 --> 30:42.479
"No, the sword...

30:43.320 --> 30:44.519
"The for sale?

30:47.120 --> 30:49.199
"No, the forsaken. The temple."

30:49.720 --> 30:51.199
-What?
-LUNN: Yes, she's sure.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.919
"'The Dark. The Sword.
The Forsaken. The Temple.'

30:55.400 --> 30:57.559
"Just that. Over and over."

30:57.640 --> 31:00.679
Dark. Sword. Forsaken. Temple.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.519
What does that mean?
What are you telling me, big man?

31:06.720 --> 31:08.799
Bennett. I need maps!

31:08.880 --> 31:11.639
I think I just worked out
what our friend here is telling us.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.519
DOCTOR: They're coordinates.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.479
BENNETT: How can they be coordinates?

31:17.080 --> 31:19.039
The Dark... Space.

31:20.120 --> 31:23.479
So, whoever's following the coordinates
knows they're going to another planet.

31:23.960 --> 31:25.359
The Sword...

31:31.760 --> 31:35.239
Orion's sword.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.919
The sword, the three stars,

31:37.000 --> 31:39.639
although one isn't actually a star
but the Orion nebula

31:39.720 --> 31:42.999
hanging down from Orion's Belt. But...

31:45.000 --> 31:46.359
If viewed from back here,

31:47.880 --> 31:50.279
the Earth becomes
the fourth bit of the sword.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.639
So, narrowed it down to a planet now.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.039
Getting closer!

31:55.040 --> 31:56.159
The Forsaken...

31:58.000 --> 32:01.159
The forsaken or abandoned or empty town.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.239
See, it's a location,

32:02.320 --> 32:06.199
beaming out to someone
or something across the universe,

32:06.280 --> 32:07.559
over and over.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.039
-Every time they kill one of us...
-It strengthens the signal.

32:10.480 --> 32:11.919
Another ghost, another transmitter.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.679
Which is why they sent
for that rescue sub.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.879
Get more people down here. Kill them.

32:15.960 --> 32:18.799
Make even more ghosts
to beam out the coordinates.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.599
"But why are they beaming out
the coordinates?

32:21.680 --> 32:23.079
"Is it a distress call?"

32:23.160 --> 32:24.159
It could be.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.679
Or a warning.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.159
Might even be a call to arms.

32:28.240 --> 32:31.039
It could mean "Come here,
they're vulnerable, help yourself."

32:33.640 --> 32:35.199
Wait a minute, though.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.799
Wait a minuet. You know what this means?

32:39.560 --> 32:41.639
It means that they're not
a natural phenomenon.

32:41.720 --> 32:45.919
It means that someone
is deliberately getting people killed,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.959
highjacking their souls
and turning them into transmitters.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.839
But what do the coordinates
lead to, though?

32:50.920 --> 32:51.999
To us? To the ghosts, what?

32:52.200 --> 32:54.679
Ah! What the coordinates are for.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.599
That is part of the answer to the other
question you're all thinking.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.479
Really? Come on, none of you?

33:04.560 --> 33:07.159
Surely, just being around me
makes you cleverer by osmosis!

33:07.240 --> 33:08.719
What is the other question?

33:11.160 --> 33:14.159
"The Temple.
The fourth part of the directions.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.519
"What's the Temple?"

33:15.600 --> 33:17.759
Finally. It's like pulling teeth.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.839
This is the flooded military town.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.479
Shops, houses, a town square,
and this...

33:22.560 --> 33:23.639
A church!

33:23.720 --> 33:26.559
Whatever the coordinates
are for, it's in that church.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.839
Find that and you're a hop, skip
and a jump to stopping them.

33:29.920 --> 33:32.039
Wait, you're not suggesting that...

33:33.680 --> 33:35.559
But we're safe now.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.439
The ghosts are in the cage,
we can get out of here.

33:39.040 --> 33:42.439
No one has to stay.
In fact, I would prefer it if you went.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.719
You'll get in the way and ask
ridiculous questions. But...

33:46.280 --> 33:49.759
You know, you have chosen
to protect and serve.

33:49.840 --> 33:53.959
You have given yourself
to science and the pursuit of knowledge.

33:54.040 --> 33:58.479
None of you have chosen
anonymous or selfish lives.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.599
Go, and a part of you
will always wonder,

34:01.680 --> 34:03.479
"What would have happened if I'd stayed?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.119
"How could I have helped?
What would I have learned?"

34:07.200 --> 34:09.039
I want you to go.

34:09.120 --> 34:11.159
But you should know
what it is that you're leaving.

34:13.920 --> 34:15.479
Cass says we should go,

34:16.320 --> 34:19.559
but everything that happens here
is her responsibility now...

34:19.640 --> 34:21.079
So she's going to stay.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.479
So I, uh, guess I should, too.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.359
Oh, count me in.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.719
Who wants to live forever, anyway?

34:30.040 --> 34:33.119
Sorry, um, have you gone insane?

34:33.200 --> 34:34.559
We can go home.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.559
They're ghosts though.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.679
How can they be ghosts?

34:49.160 --> 34:50.639
Well, at least if I die,

34:50.720 --> 34:53.799
you know I really will
come back and haunt you, all.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.439
BENNETT: OK,
the sub is approaching the town square.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.519
Which way is the church?

35:06.960 --> 35:09.159
O'DONNELL: North-northwest, 1 50 yards.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.759
That's it. Starboard, 2 degrees.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.719
CLARA: What are we looking for, exactly?

35:21.800 --> 35:23.799
DOCTOR: Something that has
the power to raise the dead

35:23.880 --> 35:25.399
and turn them into transmitters.

35:25.480 --> 35:27.079
I expect we'll know it when we see it.

35:27.160 --> 35:28.679
BENNETT: Wait, I've found the church.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.159
DOCTOR: That's it, keep going.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.639
Wait...

35:46.800 --> 35:47.799
What's that?

35:50.200 --> 35:51.399
Move closer.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.519
It's the suspended animation chamber
from the spaceship.

36:04.280 --> 36:05.839
So the pilot could be in there.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.799
There's something inside there.

36:12.840 --> 36:15.279
But it's dead-lock sealed,
I can't open it.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.479
It should be the pilot, it should be.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.079
So why do I think it isn't?

36:20.160 --> 36:21.559
More questions.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.359
Everything I solve, just more questions.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.439
I have to go back to the beginning.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.639
We arrive, we see the ghosts.
They don't kill us.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.879
They lead us here,
they show us the spaceship.

36:37.080 --> 36:38.439
Then they try to kill us.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.919
Not translated by the Tardis. Why?

37:08.480 --> 37:09.959
Lunn, translate for me.

37:11.080 --> 37:12.519
Whenever I step outside,

37:12.600 --> 37:14.559
you are the smartest person in the room.

37:14.640 --> 37:17.639
So, tell me. What's weird about this?

37:18.400 --> 37:19.879
I know that it's all bonkers,

37:19.960 --> 37:22.239
but, you know, when you think about it,

37:22.320 --> 37:24.839
one thing keeps snagging
in your mind. What is it?

37:30.200 --> 37:31.999
"The markings on the inside
of the spaceship."

37:32.080 --> 37:36.679
The markings on the inside
of the spaceship. Yes!

37:37.440 --> 37:38.679
Why?

37:39.760 --> 37:41.279
-"I don't think they're just words."
-They're not.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.639
They're magnets.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.439
Magnets, how?

37:44.520 --> 37:48.999
Well, a localised and manufactured
electromagnetic field to be precise.

37:49.800 --> 37:53.919
The dark. The sword.
The forsaken. The temple.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.319
When we heard the coordinates
for the first time,

37:56.400 --> 37:58.679
did anyone expect them not to be that?

37:59.280 --> 38:01.559
No, exactly. Me neither.

38:01.640 --> 38:04.319
It's like we already knew somehow.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.079
Like the words were already in us.

38:06.840 --> 38:09.679
So that writing is the coordinates?

38:10.080 --> 38:14.079
Everything we see
or experience shapes us in some way.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.999
But these words actually rewrite
the synaptic connections in your brain.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.999
They literally change the way
you are wired.

38:23.120 --> 38:26.799
Clara, why don't I have
a radio in the Tardis?

38:27.400 --> 38:29.999
You took it apart and used the pieces
to make a clockwork squirrel.

38:30.840 --> 38:34.519
And because whatever song
I heard first thing in the morning,

38:34.600 --> 38:35.599
I was stuck with.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.399
Two weeks of
Mysterious Girlby Peter Andre.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.799
I was begging for the brush
of death's merciful hand.

38:42.640 --> 38:46.119
Don't you see?
These words are an ear-worm.

38:47.240 --> 38:51.039
A song you can't stop humming
even after you die.

38:52.480 --> 38:54.879
CLARA: OK,
so the spaceship lands here.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.439
The pilot leaves the writing on the wall

38:56.520 --> 38:58.359
so whoever sees it, when they die,

38:58.440 --> 38:59.919
they become a beacon of the coordinates,

39:00.000 --> 39:02.879
while he, slash she, slash it

39:02.960 --> 39:04.919
snoozes in the suspended
animation chamber.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.439
Waiting for his, slash her,
slash its mates to pick the message up.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.439
My God.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.799
Every time I think it couldn't
get more extraordinary, it surprises me.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.519
It's impossible! I hate it!
It's evil! It's astonishing!

39:20.480 --> 39:22.119
I want to kiss it to death.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.879
COMPUTER VOICE: Attention, all crew.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.119
Evacuate base immediately.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.839
Emergency protocols have been initiated.

39:28.920 --> 39:31.799
This safety message
was brought to you by Vector Petroleum.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.759
-Fuel for our futures.
-Oh, no!

39:34.440 --> 39:36.399
The ghosts tampering
with the day/night settings has caused

39:36.480 --> 39:38.079
a computer malfunction.

39:38.160 --> 39:40.519
Its first priority
is to keep the reactor cool,

39:40.920 --> 39:43.279
so it's opening the hull doors
and is flooding the base.

39:52.600 --> 39:54.239
LUNN: Cass says,
"Close the internal flood doors.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.079
"That'll contain the water
in the central corridor."

39:56.160 --> 39:57.919
-Where's the Tardis?
-O'DONNELL: On the other side.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.639
DOCTOR: We need to get there.
It's our only way out.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.519
OK, we've got 30 seconds
before the flood doors close.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.199
(PANTING)

40:08.320 --> 40:09.359
Come on!

40:29.320 --> 40:30.319
Doctor!

40:31.440 --> 40:32.599
(GROANS)

40:34.080 --> 40:35.359
(GRUNTS)

40:42.200 --> 40:45.519
DOCTOR: I'll get you and the others out.
Sit tight, I'll come back for you.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.559
CLARA: Just come over here
in the Tardis now.

40:47.640 --> 40:50.359
The Tardis won't go there.
It won't go near the ghosts.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.319
You can't just leave us!

40:55.040 --> 40:58.839
Listen to me. I'm going back in time
to when the spaceship landed.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.079
If I can understand
why this is happening,

41:01.200 --> 41:02.319
I can stop them killing anyone else.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.599
I can save you.

41:04.800 --> 41:05.839
You trust me, don't you, Clara?

41:16.800 --> 41:18.959
Wait, you're gonna go back in time?
How do you do that?

41:19.040 --> 41:20.119
Extremely well.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.439
"You're sure
they're not going to hurt us?"

41:24.520 --> 41:26.239
They can't get out of the Faraday cage.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.519
(CLANKING)

41:31.040 --> 41:32.039
(WHOOSHING)

41:32.480 --> 41:34.719
DOCTOR: Back to before the flood.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.119
"And you're sure the Doctor
won't just leave us here?"

41:44.200 --> 41:46.559
Guys, look. This is how we roll.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.319
He's gonna go away, come back,

41:48.400 --> 41:49.999
and we'll have to listen
to how he did it.

42:01.840 --> 42:03.879
LUNN: Is it Moran? Or Pritchard?
Or the mole guy?

42:03.960 --> 42:05.479
How... How'd they get out?

42:05.560 --> 42:08.039
No, I don't think
it's any of them, I think it's...

42:09.040 --> 42:10.359
A new ghost.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.279
-What does that mean?
-Well, it means that

42:13.360 --> 42:14.559
something happened in the past,

42:14.640 --> 42:16.559
it means that somebody else must have...

42:20.680 --> 42:21.919
Oh, no!

42:23.240 --> 42:24.599
Oh, no, no, no, no.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.999
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

42:58.960 --> 43:01.159
Another ghost has appeared.
What does it mean?

43:01.240 --> 43:02.239
I have to die.

43:02.320 --> 43:04.079
DOCTOR: This is the town
before it flooded.

43:04.200 --> 43:06.479
I need to know how you
create these creatures.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.959
Nothing but words.

43:08.680 --> 43:10.519
He's opened the Faraday cage.
He's let the other ghosts out.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.879
DOCTOR: This isn't about saving me.
I am a dead man walking.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.239
So, who's next?
