WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:03.904
- We're back, Edwina.

00:04.004 --> 00:06.374
- Yeah, we are.
- I just got so excited.

00:06.474 --> 00:08.376
Okay, so we'll watch
each other with our lips.

00:08.476 --> 00:09.743
- Look at it,
get that hair right.

00:09.843 --> 00:10.944
Get that hair right.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.113
- And my face,
can you make sure

00:12.213 --> 00:13.647
I don't have
any crustys right here?

00:13.747 --> 00:16.350
Them mirrors be down.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.486
They be looking at theyself,
bro.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.254
- Kenny's probably looking at
us, talking , look.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.756
Let's give a little shoulder,
ready?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.692
- Go, Sunshine.
You see how she swung that?

00:26.660 --> 00:27.995
Straight-up hustlers.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.234
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:33.334 --> 00:35.603
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.105
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:37.205 --> 00:39.107
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.441
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.775
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:41.875 --> 00:43.477
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:43.577 --> 00:45.012
- You shut your face.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.181
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.349
- We're back, baby!

00:52.586 --> 00:54.054
- Oh, my God.

00:54.155 --> 00:56.224
- I mean,
we have it figured out.

00:56.324 --> 00:59.160
We don't have a store,
'cause running a store

00:59.260 --> 01:00.394
is a freaking nightmare.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.830
Now, we buy just enough stuff

01:02.930 --> 01:05.133
to make just enough money
to have everything we want

01:05.233 --> 01:07.101
and the time to enjoy it.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.602
- Yeah.
Life is a little simpler.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.839
- Sometimes, you gotta
work smarter, not harder.

01:11.939 --> 01:14.708
Life's too short
to just work till you die.

01:14.808 --> 01:15.843
- That's beautiful.
- I know.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.745
I'm gonna crochet that
on a pillow.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.247
- You should.
- Cross-stitch it.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.681
Sew it. I'm gonna sew
it on a pillow.

01:20.781 --> 01:21.982
- Can you do
all of those things?

01:22.082 --> 01:23.317
- None of them,
but I can learn.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.752
There's a YouTube video for it.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.654
*

01:26.754 --> 01:29.523
- I don't really know why
we're coming to this auction.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.958
- Because there's an auction.

01:31.058 --> 01:32.326
- I know, honey,
but we have, like,

01:32.426 --> 01:35.095
over 23-plus storage units.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.930
- Tell you what, if they stop
storage auctions,

01:37.030 --> 01:38.366
we have enough stuff
for two, three years.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.833
We good.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.969
Casey looks at 23 units
and sees a problem.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.737
I see investments.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.906
- Well, I know it's good
to have backup merchandise,

01:46.006 --> 01:47.508
but we're, like, overflowing.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.676
It's supply and demand.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.678
We have, like,
way too much supply.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.713
- And I demand if there's
a good unit, we buy it.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.316
*

01:55.416 --> 01:58.986
- So we are in Riverside today.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.789
And I am not feeling very good.

02:01.889 --> 02:04.358
And all I really want to do
is go back to bed.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.993
Just like that
old saying goes,

02:06.093 --> 02:09.297
"Starve a fever,
auction a cold"?

02:09.397 --> 02:11.865
Not feeling it.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.567
*

02:14.702 --> 02:15.836
- What, you eating
a crumb cake?

02:15.936 --> 02:17.305
- Come on, got one for me
and one for you.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.972
- You the best friend ever,
bro.

02:19.072 --> 02:20.941
- I won't eat those.
They're chemical cakes.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.777
- Yeah, they are.
- I'm all chemical-ed up.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.012
Oh, .

02:25.112 --> 02:26.814
Look what Vegas done
blew in here.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.582
The showgirls!

02:28.682 --> 02:29.783
What's up?
I like the outfit.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.252
- Thank you.
- Y'all shining.

02:31.352 --> 02:32.920
- Damn, we got
a meeting going on?

02:33.020 --> 02:34.855
- Oh, she brought the...
- Top meat.

02:34.955 --> 02:37.458
- All my favorite people,
Brandi, Jarrod.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.726
Talkative like always.

02:38.826 --> 02:39.993
Are you guys here
to buy auctions?

02:40.093 --> 02:41.362
- Of course.
Don't we look serious?

02:42.730 --> 02:44.932
- I buy the whole auction.
- Oh. Okay.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.667
- You guys are new
to the business, right?

02:46.767 --> 02:49.603
- No.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.972
- You can't bullshize
a bullshizer.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.508
- See, we rule
the Vegas antique shops...

02:54.608 --> 02:56.910
both: Thrift stores.
- That's our genre.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.747
- Vegas was fun.
I lived there for 15 years.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.883
I realized the people
just sucked, you know?

03:02.983 --> 03:04.685
- Tell us how you really feel!

03:04.785 --> 03:07.321
- I think in Vegas everybody
either has a gambling problem,

03:07.421 --> 03:09.390
drinking problem,
or they cheat on their spouses.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.191
- Oh, yeah...
- Uh-uh. I mean, uh-uh.

03:11.292 --> 03:14.262
He has offended, like,
all of our family.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.429
- Done.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.930
- So we finally met Rene.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.732
- Mmm.

03:18.832 --> 03:19.800
Grab your purse, girl.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.034
- Don't be offended!

03:21.134 --> 03:23.471
I will not be insulted.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.005
- I'll be back, bro.

03:25.105 --> 03:27.107
I'm gonna see what kind of
snacks they got around here.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.411
- Everybody left.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.613
- Okay, everybody!
Thank you for coming out today

03:32.713 --> 03:35.283
to Tri-City Self Storage
here in Riverside.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.485
Once I open the door,
you guys can't go in

03:37.585 --> 03:38.552
and you can't touch anything.

03:38.652 --> 03:39.753
It's a cash-only auction.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.154
So if you have
cash in your pocket,

03:41.255 --> 03:42.423
that means that you can buy.

03:42.523 --> 03:45.225
If you guys are ready, so am I!
Let's go!

03:45.326 --> 03:46.360
- Let's do it!
- Whoo!

03:47.995 --> 03:50.130
- Okay, guys, we're
gonna open both of these doors.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.400
They are connected
in the center, so here we go.

03:53.534 --> 03:54.735
*

03:54.835 --> 03:57.004
- Oh, my goodness!

03:57.104 --> 04:02.075
*

04:02.175 --> 04:03.877
- Damn, that's a big-ass unit.

04:03.977 --> 04:05.646
- Holy moley.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.482
*

04:08.582 --> 04:10.784
- That chair is totally
mid-century, but beat to crap.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.486
Nice painting
all the way in the back.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.388
You got good eyes.

04:14.488 --> 04:16.657
- Kind of want to buy, just to
take a chance, but I might...

04:16.757 --> 04:18.225
- Oh, my God,
you're freaking me out.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.827
,
it's gonna be a lot of work.

04:19.927 --> 04:20.994
- Yeah.

04:21.094 --> 04:21.995
- Look, it's a white suitcase.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.031
- Mm-hmm, that's cute.

04:24.131 --> 04:26.233
All these containers
and drawers.

04:26.334 --> 04:29.002
This would, like, fill up
our store to the max.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.170
This is it.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.772
- Ain't that one of them, uh,

04:31.872 --> 04:33.273
when they burn you up and put
you in the case right there?

04:34.608 --> 04:35.809
No, I think that's, like,
a sewing kit.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.511
- Lord have mercy.

04:37.611 --> 04:40.414
- I don't know, but this
is borderline, right here.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.749
- There's something weird
about--

04:41.849 --> 04:43.584
there's like a weird energy
with these units.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.353
But you know what
you might find?

04:45.453 --> 04:47.220
Coin collections,
old jewelry,

04:47.321 --> 04:49.089
like you're gonna find
that kind of stuff in here.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.458
I don't know, bro.
I don't know, man.

04:50.558 --> 04:51.992
I don't know.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.427
You buy the unit,

04:53.527 --> 04:56.664
and I'll pay you 200 bucks
for the painting, as is.

04:56.764 --> 04:59.833
- Well, Rene's.
gonna give me money.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.669
Hmm, yeah, I'd take that.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.236
- 200 for the painting,
no matter what.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.338
- Halloween unit:
if you're not scared

05:04.438 --> 05:06.273
what do you say, 500?
- $50!

05:06.374 --> 05:07.675
50, and now 100.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.678
100, 125.

05:10.778 --> 05:11.812
125, 150?

05:11.912 --> 05:14.482

05:14.582 --> 05:15.949
Now 200.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.618
Now 225?

05:17.718 --> 05:20.253

05:20.354 --> 05:21.622
Now 275?
- Yeah.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.623
- It's 300.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.057
300, now 325?

05:24.157 --> 05:25.325
Now 350.
350.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.461
- Yeah.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.663
375, and now 400?

05:29.763 --> 05:32.199
- I don't like it that much.

05:32.299 --> 05:35.002
375.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.837
And now 400?

05:36.937 --> 05:39.407
Sold it to you, $375.
Kenny got it.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.009
I'm gonna go get it right now.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.210
- Okay.

05:44.878 --> 05:45.979
- You trying to break
all the furniture.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.915
- I'm not breaking nothing.
Help me up.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.483
*

05:49.583 --> 05:51.084
You got it?
- Yeah.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.053
- Ooh, I'm too fat
to be doing this .

- One, two, three, five,

05:55.055 --> 05:57.257

05:57.357 --> 05:58.592
- Pleasure doing
business with you.

- You too, Sherlock.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.094

of  in there. Have fun.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.364
- No, it's--it's good unit.
Don't worry.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.199
It's not haunted.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.469
- Now, who gonna

06:17.177 --> 06:18.946
I'ma need help with this unit.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.284
Can't believe
I bought this .

06:24.384 --> 06:27.755
Baskets, voodoo,

and move on.

06:35.863 --> 06:41.669
*

06:41.769 --> 06:42.770
.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.605
Annabelle robotic-ass sister.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.774
Oh, my God.
A whole tree branch.

06:46.874 --> 06:50.243
What--why would you put
a tree branch in the unit?

06:50.343 --> 06:52.580
- This look like my childhood
doll that spoke French.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.114
- That's the saker on it.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.350
Look, the divider, the
footstool to tie your shoes.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.352
- It's gonna be fun
to go through.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.389
- Huh.
What do you suppose that is?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.424
"Kiss."
- Lady shaving kit.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.259
- You know, I--
I hate dolls.

07:06.359 --> 07:07.561
- Ducks.
- I didn't used to hate ducks.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.262
But I kind of do now.

07:09.362 --> 07:10.698
- The duck looks interesting.

07:10.798 --> 07:11.899
That looks really old.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.634
And the doll.
- Yeah, it's broken.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.503
- Yeah, you're right.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.804
- Okay, guys, here we go.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.839
A little 5x10
with a creepy doll.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.609
25?

07:21.709 --> 07:22.843
- 25!
- 25.

07:25.479 --> 07:29.049
Anybody wanna be 30?

07:29.149 --> 07:31.652
Sold it to you, Vegas ladies.
- Yeah!

07:34.021 --> 07:35.188
I don't get it.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.490
- Why you worried about
our logistics?

07:36.590 --> 07:37.758
- Stop worrying about us!
- I'm just saying.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.793
- You got a big warehouse,
a big store...

07:39.893 --> 07:42.295
- And a big mouth.
- A big belly!

07:42.395 --> 07:44.064
*

07:44.164 --> 07:46.266
- All right, here we go,
5X10!

07:46.366 --> 07:48.435
*

07:48.536 --> 07:49.837
- This is trash.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.205
*

07:52.305 --> 07:54.141
I'm so glad we didn't
wait till the end.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.009
- Uh, remember
we're not buying.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.745
This is not what we came for.

07:57.845 --> 07:58.846
- I mean, it's actually good.

07:58.946 --> 07:59.880
There's a little barbeque
in there.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.481
Suitcases.
It has potential.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.516
I think I'm gonna buy that one.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.817
I feel good about this one.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.286
- Well, I guess marriage
is about compromise.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.521
*

08:07.621 --> 08:08.722
Well, I guess you could buy it.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.124
It's, like, little.

08:11.224 --> 08:13.794
- That looks like
all low-end trash.

08:13.894 --> 08:14.795
- Mm-hmm.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.164
- I'm gonna pass on it.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.699
- Working smart is one thing.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.868
But Jarrod's trying
to not work at all today.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.103
I think that there's
a few decent things in there.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.072
There's a barbeque;
there's that shampooer.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.040
That chair is actually
cleanable.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.776
We didn't come out
here for nothing.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.711
- I'm with you.
- All right.

08:30.811 --> 08:32.780
- They got barbeque grill,
food table.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.181
Almost a picnic set.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.016
Extension cord
to hang yourself.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.317
*

08:37.417 --> 08:38.719
- All right, here we go!

08:38.819 --> 08:41.021
And what do you say, 50?
- 25.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.057
25, 30?

08:44.157 --> 08:46.560
- Yeah.
30.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.328
35.
40.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.997
- Yeah.
- 100 bucks.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.165
100.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.634
He's gonna--
- 200.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.368
200 now.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.871
- Let 'em have it.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.507
Not 225?
Sold it.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.610
- I got something.
I'm happy!

09:02.710 --> 09:04.444
- He was just giving us a hard
time about that last unit.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.380
And he bought a trashier unit!
- That's a score.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.116
- All right, you guys, that's
gonna do it for today!

09:09.216 --> 09:10.684
Thank you so much
for coming out!

09:10.784 --> 09:12.285
- Should have bought early.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.421
- What would you propose that
we should have bought early?

09:14.521 --> 09:18.025
Those giant units for ?
- Yeah, the trashy ones, yeah.

09:18.125 --> 09:20.594
- Oof.

09:22.730 --> 09:24.464
- You gonna go take you
some Theraflu?

09:24.564 --> 09:27.334
- Yeah.
Drink me a bottle of NyQuil.

09:27.434 --> 09:30.671
The cherry or the green one?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.239
- Not cherry,
I like the regular.

09:32.339 --> 09:35.475
That nasty?

09:35.575 --> 09:36.810
- Aren't you happy
I didn't buy the big one?

09:36.910 --> 09:38.478
- Yes, extremely happy.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.413
- Casey didn't want me to buy.

09:40.513 --> 09:41.649
But I'm gonna
prove to her that

09:41.749 --> 09:43.250
you can't have too much stuff.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.352
Check the shoes.

09:45.452 --> 09:46.754
- $10.
- Oh, that's cool.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.256
- DeWalt quick charger.
30 bucks.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.490
Chair, 10 bucks.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.926
That's nice.
Bissell, 50 bucks.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.227
- Easy $10 right there.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.096
- Ooh, ice cream scoops.
Ooh, I like ice cream.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.097
This is good.
This is a vintage one.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.599
This is 10 bucks.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.869
This is cool.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.437
"White Mountain Junior."

10:04.537 --> 10:05.605
Damn, it's a junior model.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.340
- I don't think
you need the plus size.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.976
- Yeah, I do.
Here, hold this.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.812
- How many ice cream scoops
does this person have?

10:11.912 --> 10:12.813
- You know,
some of these old ones

10:12.913 --> 10:14.147
can be really, really good?

10:14.247 --> 10:15.649
Like, people actually
collect this stuff.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.017
- And it's not fat guys.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.086
- A little sensitive
on that subject, aren't we?

10:19.186 --> 10:20.120
- I'm not sensitive,
I'm just saying,

10:20.220 --> 10:21.588
we should get this checked out.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.390
Maybe we can go to, like,
an ice cream factory.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.626
Ooh, and they have ice cream.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.696
This locker's exactly
what we don't need.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.698
More stuff and ice cream.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.866
- Seen these bags.
These are usually tools.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.201
Like 20 bucks.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.870
Here's suitcase.
10 bucks.

10:36.970 --> 10:37.971
Another bag like this.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.007
This one newer, 40 bucks.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.108
There's more ice cream
right here.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.710
Insta-Freeze.

10:42.810 --> 10:44.444
We're gonna go
to a ice cream factory.

10:44.544 --> 10:45.713
Or an ice cream shop.

10:45.813 --> 10:46.747
Barbeque.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.450
- Oh.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.651
*

10:51.752 --> 10:52.920
Ugh.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.287
- But I get 10 bucks each
for the canisters.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.557
Oh, here's another
ice cream thing.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.792
This is cool.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.160
This is even older
than the other ones.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.029
"Made in the USA."
We're gonna eat ice cream.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.663
And I'm only doing it
for research purposes.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.465
You can't buy
too many lockers,

11:05.565 --> 11:07.300
and you can't have
too much ice cream.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.568
This is a man-sized spoon.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.003
Like, I only had
four spoons-ful.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.271
*

11:13.173 --> 11:15.843
- I cannot believe we got this
for 25 bucks. What?

11:15.943 --> 11:17.077
- That's probably
our best deal yet.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.279
- Oh!
Talk about budget.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.882
Rene tried to come at us
like we bought trash.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.583
- You know,
for a "bargain hunter,"

11:23.683 --> 11:24.885
I think he really
missed the mark.

11:24.985 --> 11:28.055
Let's first discuss--oh!

11:28.155 --> 11:29.790
- Yes.
- She's like Small Wonder.

11:29.890 --> 11:34.061
Remember?

11:34.161 --> 11:36.096
- This creepy doll...
- It winds.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.530
- Shut up.
- It winds!

11:37.630 --> 11:38.799
- No way. No way.
- Put it down. Put it down.

11:38.899 --> 11:39.967
*

11:41.268 --> 11:42.635
It walks!
- Oh, my God.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.671
Is she possessed?

11:44.772 --> 11:45.839
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.941
She's still walking.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.542
- We're gonna keep all the
knives and the sharp objects

11:49.642 --> 11:51.211
away from this one,
just to be safe.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.579
- Yeah, good plan.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.347
Okay, this looks like
a bunch of trash.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.116
Little Tweety Bird.
- Clothes.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.351
- Clothes. That's all trash.
- This is all trash.

11:58.451 --> 12:00.020
Oh, my God, these seat belts.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.588
People, like, look for these.

12:01.688 --> 12:03.957
- Can make cute belt.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.692
- Oh, my gosh, yes.
End-of-the-world fashion.

12:05.793 --> 12:06.927
- Mm!
- $2 apiece.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.696
- That, two, four, six, eight,
$8.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.765
What the hell is this?

12:11.865 --> 12:13.266
- Oh, I love that.

12:13.366 --> 12:14.534
You can make the macramé.

12:14.634 --> 12:15.969
Like to
- Hang it up.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.771
It's like a piece of reclaim.
Look how light it is.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.572
- I would buy this
for 15 bucks.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.640
- Easily.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.976
*

12:23.076 --> 12:25.078
Ooh.
That's cute.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.147
- That's cute.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.316
Oh, it's like for a crib.
Look.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.084
- Ohh.
I thought it was a dress.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.419
- I know, I thought it was
an old wedding dress.

12:32.519 --> 12:33.620
- It's for babies.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.923
Yeah, $5?
- $10.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.090
- $10 it is.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.625
- This we can
sell for 20 bucks.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.293
- Oh, the Asian flair.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.428
This is really cute.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.563
- Oh, no, it's on its last leg.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.932
And it's all broken
and .

12:45.032 --> 12:46.233
*

12:46.333 --> 12:47.868
The hell is this?
- Ooh.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.036
*

12:49.136 --> 12:50.370
- Wait.
- Oh, wow.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.972
- It's like the end of a sword.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.440
- Like, nunchakus...
- Like a samurai.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.108
- Look, these are like tools.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.676
- This might be
sword.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.011
- I don't know what it is.
- This is interesting.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.346
- I want to find
out what this is.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.881
This is pretty interesting.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.916
I usually
know my way around a sword.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.717
But this one here?
It has me stumped.

13:04.818 --> 13:08.188
*

13:08.288 --> 13:09.990
- Oh, look at
this little jewelry box!

13:10.090 --> 13:10.991
- That's cute.
I love that.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.225
- Yep.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.660
- Okay.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.162
both: Ooh.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.163
- This is cute.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.397
- Yeah.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.099
- Oh, that's
a cute little backpack.

13:19.199 --> 13:20.500
Made in Italy,
this is real leather.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.202
- Yes, that's cute.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.304
- Easily.
And don't forget about these.

13:24.404 --> 13:27.007
- Oh, ye we have to
get these checked out.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.276
- I wish I could rub
our finds in Rene's face.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.111
- Be nice.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.513
Oh, my God.
- 42DD.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.015
- We can give it
to Rene's wife.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.349
- Oh, my God,
she's the only person we know

13:36.449 --> 13:37.384
with this much top meat.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.818
- You know, like
an olive branch.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.620
Like, an olive bra.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.396
- I've got my son Chase
and my buddy Nelson

13:49.496 --> 13:50.998
here to do
all the heavy lifting,

13:51.098 --> 13:52.799
while I find me some treasure.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.634
- I thought you said there was
scary  in here.

13:54.734 --> 13:55.668
- It is, bro.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.438
*

13:58.538 --> 14:01.341
Would you like some punch,
yeah?

14:01.441 --> 14:04.444
Look at the container!
"Annabelle 17."

14:04.544 --> 14:06.146
*

14:06.246 --> 14:07.414
Come on, bro,
don't put that .

14:07.514 --> 14:08.748
- I'm serious.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.283
*

14:10.383 --> 14:12.352
All right.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.754
What is this?
Oh, my God, bro.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.124
No money.
$5 microwave.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.759
- Chicken cutlets.
- This is not good.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.129
If this here is faux,
everything else is faux.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.530
- Sure.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.132
- Okay.
Thank you, Dad.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.134
Appreciate the knowledge.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.269
Oh, no-no-no, put it back.
That's bad juju.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.971
All the spells are coming out.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.906
- Third-grade-ass
Christmas ornaments, no money.

14:33.006 --> 14:33.907
*

14:34.007 --> 14:36.043
Put y'all mojo on here.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.844
- You do it, Carl.
- And the winner is...

14:37.945 --> 14:39.146
- Hey.
- Record!

14:39.246 --> 14:41.581
Pat Benatar!
$2 a record.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.550
That's 100 records,
times 2.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.086
My "Sesame Street" says...
- $200.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.254
- Y'all go on
with your bad ass.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.522
I know I taught you good, bro.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.293
Oh, my God!
Witch-y ass bitch.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.028
- That's my friend.
Come here.

14:55.128 --> 14:57.497
- They should put this right
in front of the whole locker.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.266
This some kind of sprayer, huh?

14:59.366 --> 15:02.069
Probably get about
50 bucks for this thing.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.636
Hey, Nelson.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.539
- Yeah, all this over here
is trash,

15:06.639 --> 15:08.641
and then we got some
washer and dryers over here.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.077
- How much you think
the washer and dryer?

15:10.177 --> 15:11.111
- What, like, 200 bucks
or something?

15:11.211 --> 15:12.545
- Yeah.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.381
- Then we got a couple cabinets
over here, Pop.

15:14.481 --> 15:15.815
- What you think
I sell the cabinets for?

15:15.915 --> 15:17.884
- Special deal, 75 for both.

15:17.985 --> 15:21.088
- Well, bro,
been a long day.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.690
I can honestly say
I made some money.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.158
Let's get
the hell out of Dodge.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.660
- We gonna get some
cheeseburgers on you, right?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.696
In

15:29.796 --> 15:30.830
- I guess so, bro.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.166
- Come on.
McDoubles, here we come.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.368
- Of course he want
a double cheeseburger.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.936
That's my boy.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.040
- I think this is
the place, right?

15:40.140 --> 15:41.474
- Think so.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.910
- Can't wait to get
this stuff looked at though.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.278
- Hello.
- Hello.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.513
- You must be Mike.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.381
- Oh, my, what did
you ladies bring today?

15:48.481 --> 15:49.816
- We're not sure.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.285
- We're taking our
sword pieces to Mike.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.354
- He's our samurai guy.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.390
- Oh, let's take a look
and see what's in the box.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.725
*

15:58.825 --> 16:01.394
At first glance,
what you have is

16:01.494 --> 16:04.297
a Japanese samurai sword
handle.

16:04.397 --> 16:08.068
These are also parts
of a Japanese sword.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.570
See, these are all the front
pieces to the handle.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.039
- Mm.
- Oh, okay.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.807
- These are actually something
my grandmother used to use.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.210
These are Japanese
scissors for sewing.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.611
- Oh, wow.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.147
- So these--kind of interesting
that they're in here.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.449
And some type of volcanic rock.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.717
- Okay, parting gift.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.719
- Uh, your box

16:26.819 --> 16:29.622
is probably the
most interesting piece here.

16:29.722 --> 16:35.128
*

16:35.228 --> 16:36.729
- So--yeah.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.665
This box has nothing to do
with Japanese swords.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.500
It's from World War II.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.502
It's actually a box
for a machine gun.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.237
Like ammo, like rounds?

16:44.337 --> 16:47.174
- No, for the actual
parts of a machine gun.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.642
- Oh, wow.

16:49.742 --> 16:50.943
- This is almost like

16:51.044 --> 16:52.612
a maintenance schedule
or something.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.315
So this is kind of
just like a keepsake box.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.683
- Yeah.
- I mean, the soldier

16:56.783 --> 16:59.486
could have been at Iwo Jima
or somewhere like that.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.488
- Okay, so we have to know

17:01.588 --> 17:03.790
how much is all of this worth?

17:06.859 --> 17:08.728
You're probably not
looking at much,

17:08.828 --> 17:11.231
because the quality is not

17:11.331 --> 17:13.466
quite at the collector level.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.404
I'd say up to about $200.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.705
*

17:18.805 --> 17:20.140
both: Okay.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.741
- That's good enough for us.
- We can work with that.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.077
- So what I've seen is

17:24.177 --> 17:26.746
people always have
what was in the box,

17:26.846 --> 17:30.417
but they're now looking for
the box.

17:30.517 --> 17:34.654
So if somebody has
the gun that was in this box,

17:34.754 --> 17:36.423
they might be willing to pay...

17:36.523 --> 17:39.092
*

17:39.192 --> 17:41.194
Probably about $1,000.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.729
Just for the box.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.066
- Yep.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.201
- The box is--

17:48.301 --> 17:49.902
- You know who's
gonna be pissed?

17:50.002 --> 17:51.338
- Rene.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.908
*

17:56.008 --> 17:57.810
- Why did he stick me
with the big one?

17:57.910 --> 18:00.147
- That's 'cause
your dad's lazy.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.714
- Hi, guys, welcome to
Farrell's Sweet Pete's.

18:01.814 --> 18:02.749
- Thank you.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.517
- A lot.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.420
- We're at Heaven on Earth,
Farrell's ice cream parlor,

18:07.520 --> 18:10.157
to get our sugar fix--
I mean, money fix.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.359
- We can just set up
all your stuff right here.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.793
- All right.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.196
- You definitely have some
cool, vintage ice cream stuff.

18:16.296 --> 18:19.799
This big guy right here
is a little bit of an antique.

18:19.899 --> 18:23.102
But still, if you went into
your typical department store

18:23.203 --> 18:24.937
and looked for
an ice cream maker,

18:25.037 --> 18:27.707
you're gonna find something
that looks very similar to this

18:27.807 --> 18:31.178
and operates exactly
how this machine operates.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.313
- Why is there a bucket
in a bucket?

18:33.413 --> 18:35.815
- So how this machine works is

18:35.915 --> 18:38.718
this is where all the cream...
- Dude.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.288
- Water, and ingredients
for the ice cream go.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.955
And you put this
in this bucket.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.458
And then what do you think else
is a really important thing

18:45.558 --> 18:46.493
to making ice cream?

18:46.593 --> 18:47.860
- Chocolate.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.462
- Chocolate comes after.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.531
Something to make ice cream...
- Ice.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.732
- Cold, ice, yeah.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.001
So your ice goes in
the bucket around it.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.704
And then you put this guy
right there.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.707
Then you just
start cranking away.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.342
And you start making ice cream.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.579
- My guess would be
this is something probably

19:06.679 --> 19:08.848
around the late '20s,
early '30s.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.717
As we got into the '50s,

19:10.817 --> 19:13.586
electronics became
more prevalent in our kitchens.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.589
And I think that's what
your mom probably has there.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.758
That particular machine is

19:18.858 --> 19:20.360
a little bit of an oddity.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.830
I've never seen one like it.
It still has the agitator.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.165
And my guess would be that
the ice would have gone

19:26.266 --> 19:27.467
into the bottom.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.502
- What about my single-serving
guy here?

19:29.602 --> 19:31.738
- It's not necessarily
a single-serving unit.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.073
This looks a little bit
more like a salesman's sample.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.308
- Oh, wow.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.009
- So something to take
on the road with them

19:37.109 --> 19:40.012
to talk to the wives in
the kitchen or to businesses,

19:40.112 --> 19:41.881
to sell a unit like this.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.350
- Interesting.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.784
There's only one thing
I love more than ice cream,

19:44.884 --> 19:45.985
and that's candy.

19:46.085 --> 19:47.387
And then money, I guess.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.289
So that's all fun and tasty,

19:49.389 --> 19:51.190
but what's that stuff
actually worth?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.826
Can I make money?
- There is some value in it.

19:53.926 --> 19:58.164
For the whole set,
you're probably looking...

20:00.400 --> 20:02.235
Probably around 300
for the whole set.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.703
- Yeah.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.204
- How many scoops
will that get me?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.774
- For you, I cut you a deal.
How about 100 scoops?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.610
- Got a deal.
- We're gonna share, obviously.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.912
male narrator: The real
bargain hunters

20:13.012 --> 20:16.816
Edwina and Shana
snatched up over 1,200 bucks

20:16.916 --> 20:18.818
with their box.

20:18.918 --> 20:23.122
Kenny Crossley creeped up
on a $350 profit.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.760
Rene and Casey churned out
an extra 300 scoops.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.196
While Jarrod and Brandi
learned

20:30.297 --> 20:32.465
it's hard to be smart.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.902
- All right, Tatiana,
you ready for this?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.370
- Oh, yeah.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.339
- I'm pretty sure you've
never seen a sundae like this.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.274
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.242
- That thing's huge!

20:43.343 --> 20:46.679
- So this is the world famous
Farrell's Zoo.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.881
Ladies first.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.517
*

20:50.617 --> 20:52.352
- I can take this.
- No.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.986
- Hey!
Share.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.955
- I am sharing.
- I only got one bite.

20:56.055 --> 20:58.358
- Oh...oh!
- Oh, my God!
