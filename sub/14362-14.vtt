07:30.579 --> 07:33.207
It broadens my shoulders,
slims my waist,

07:33.321 --> 07:35.487
and gives me the muscles
of an eighth grader.

07:35.578 --> 07:38.932

superficial high-end apparel.

07:39.098 --> 07:41.848

that protects me

throws my way.

08:17.326 --> 08:19.624
and says,
"Back to work."

End of the day, it's always,
"See you tomorrow."

08:22.415 --> 08:25.587

that maybe you guys

in a way that I can't.

08:32.275 --> 08:35.025

way more sway than us.

you got to light a candle,

shake off the sheets,
and get your man all syncopated

with the rhythms
of your lady jazz.

08:43.184 --> 08:46.352
Well, I'm not saying
that my lady jazz isn't in play.

08:46.409 --> 08:48.564
It's definitely in play.

Cassidy. Hi.

18:19.493 --> 18:20.667
Is it a bad time?

18:20.797 --> 18:22.552
Uh, not at all. No.

18:22.645 --> 18:25.322
- Okay. Say it.
- Oinge?

18:25.892 --> 18:27.550
Uh, hang on, Cassidy.

18:27.714 --> 18:29.725
Are you sure
this isn't a bad time?

18:29.917 --> 18:30.885
You obviously have company.

18:30.982 --> 18:32.013
Hutch: - Say it again.
- Oinge.

18:32.086 --> 18:33.662
I hear someone
saying "oinge."

18:33.794 --> 18:35.804
Wait.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.452
Are you saying "oinge" 'cause
you heard someone say "oinge,"

18:38.531 --> 18:39.489
or are you saying it that way

18:39.564 --> 18:41.248
'cause that's how
you say "orange."

18:41.383 --> 18:43.760
- What?
- What juice comes from Florida?

18:43.854 --> 18:46.163
- Oinge?
- Oh, my God!

18:47.360 --> 18:49.768
Listen, I just called to say

18:49.862 --> 18:52.598
that it's possible
I may have left you

18:52.700 --> 18:55.420
an embarrassing message
the other night.

18:55.638 --> 18:58.289
Yeah, uh,
I might have heard that.

18:58.376 --> 19:00.573
Ugh!
So you knew it was me?

19:00.759 --> 19:02.280
Of course I knew it was you.

19:03.238 --> 19:06.388
Uh [Chuckles] so [Clears throat]

19:07.067 --> 19:08.393
how you been?

19:08.631 --> 19:09.951
Okay.

19:12.229 --> 19:13.850
Mike: Told you I was no good
in the spotlight.

19:13.975 --> 19:15.573
Was it as bad
as I thought it was?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.940
Probably a little worse.

19:18.046 --> 19:20.615
What happened to all that stuff
you talked about the other day?

19:20.695 --> 19:21.786
Watching their kids grow up,

19:21.873 --> 19:25.047
how your crew made it
a great place to work every day?

19:25.216 --> 19:27.121
Pretty sure I got
some of that in there.

19:27.538 --> 19:29.067
No, you didn't.

19:29.393 --> 19:30.341
Hmm.

19:34.466 --> 19:35.563
Okay.

19:36.323 --> 19:37.927
Do you know
how embarrassing it is

19:38.033 --> 19:39.233
to show up at an awards ceremony

19:39.309 --> 19:41.620
wearing the same outfit
as another woman?

19:42.157 --> 19:43.764
[ Sighs ] Drive.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.770
[ Engine turns over ]

19:47.578 --> 19:49.236
Well, I think I got the AC off,

19:49.345 --> 19:51.557
but I might have accidentally
got the heater stuck on.

19:51.647 --> 19:52.947
Oh, thanks.

19:53.713 --> 19:55.067
Well, you better get going.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.765
I'm sure Angel's got
something special planned

19:57.856 --> 20:00.266
to celebrate your B-plus.

20:00.397 --> 20:03.247
Oh, actually, Angel and I
broke up a couple weeks ago.

20:03.537 --> 20:05.399
Oh? Really?

20:05.835 --> 20:06.988
Yeah.

20:07.277 --> 20:08.676
Relationships are hard.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.194
I know. I know.

20:12.454 --> 20:14.156
How are things
with your boyfriend?

20:14.395 --> 20:15.669
What boyfriend?

20:15.815 --> 20:17.571
You know, the Glossner guy.

20:18.032 --> 20:20.385
Oh, oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.482
I do not like him at all.

20:22.578 --> 20:25.216
I mean, yeah,
I think he liked me a lot,

20:25.333 --> 20:28.674
but, uh, no, not even close.

20:28.879 --> 20:29.941
Really?

20:30.327 --> 20:31.512
Really.

20:35.641 --> 20:37.518
Hey, you feel it?

20:38.064 --> 20:39.480
It's getting warm in here.

20:40.137 --> 20:41.299
Yes.

20:41.404 --> 20:43.665
It is heating up considerably.

20:43.807 --> 20:45.840
<i>Funny thing is when you have</i>
<i>a history with someone,</i>

20:45.922 --> 20:46.963
<i>it's easy to connect.</i>

20:47.061 --> 20:48.583
<i>The words just seem to flow.</i>

20:48.686 --> 20:51.046
I still can't hear it.
Oinge?

20:51.138 --> 20:52.466
Am I saying it weird?

20:52.589 --> 20:54.422
[ Laughing ] Yes,
it's absolutely weird.

20:54.585 --> 20:56.513
It's not in any way
how you say that word.

20:57.037 --> 20:58.056
[ Laughs ]

20:58.154 --> 21:00.483
<i>And sometimes if you have</i>
<i>a long history with someone,</i>

21:00.603 --> 21:02.830
<i>you don't need</i>
<i>many words at all.</i>

21:03.279 --> 21:05.179
Hey, guys.

21:05.340 --> 21:06.997
- Hey.
- Have a good night.

21:07.292 --> 21:08.782
Cool party.

21:09.075 --> 21:13.831
Yeah, listen, um... I thought
I said certain things

21:13.969 --> 21:16.452
that, uh,
I might not have said.

21:16.552 --> 21:19.365
So I want to say, um...

21:21.883 --> 21:24.531
you know, see you tomorrow.

21:25.374 --> 21:26.891
See you tomorrow, Mike.

21:32.824 --> 21:33.813
