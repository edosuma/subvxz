00:19.394 --> 00:21.449
<i>Does anybody have eyes
on our mystery guy?</i>

00:22.067 --> 00:24.610
Unit one, negative. I'm
on the main casino floor.

00:24.660 --> 00:26.306
I'm heading over to BJ pit three.

00:26.316 --> 00:28.211
<i>Copy that, unit one.</i>

00:37.238 --> 00:37.874
Just get out of my way!

00:37.908 --> 00:38.509
Hey, just a second.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.241
Go ahead, tough guy, huh!

00:40.441 --> 00:42.186
Break it up. Break up!

00:42.256 --> 00:44.161
Hey, aren't you...!

00:45.398 --> 00:47.961
Shots fired. Main floor. BJ pit three.

00:47.991 --> 00:48.760
Dispatch, shooter

00:48.796 --> 00:51.740
<i>is on the run. All available
security to BJ pit three.</i>

00:51.741 --> 00:54.066
Boatwright's down. Get an ambulance.

00:54.624 --> 00:56.659
Find the shooter. Find the shooter.

00:56.689 --> 00:57.647
I don't see him, I don't see him.

00:57.677 --> 01:00.540
I got him. Shooter's headed
for the slot carousel.

01:00.948 --> 01:01.767
There he goes.

01:01.826 --> 01:03.612
He's headed for the guest elevators.

01:05.178 --> 01:06.305
He's got a hostage.

01:06.345 --> 01:08.309
Give me the whole tower.
Three across the board.

01:11.322 --> 01:12.419
Get the police.

01:12.698 --> 01:14.993
We need SWAT. Now!

01:21.626 --> 01:25.127
We got the suspect holed up on three.
Floors above and below evacuated.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.224
Where's the negotiator?

01:26.244 --> 01:28.119
En route. At least an hour away.

01:29.566 --> 01:31.880
Well, I'm here now.

01:41.764 --> 01:42.539
Clear.

01:42.574 --> 01:43.316
Clear.

01:47.669 --> 01:49.903
Las Vegas police. Open the door.

01:58.113 --> 02:00.487
Well, I guess this is the place.

02:03.778 --> 02:07.529
Just another domestic violence
case. I wish I had a nickel.

02:08.916 --> 02:11.768
Janice Cutler. Shot in the mouth.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.579
Single boy's the only smart one.

02:15.609 --> 02:19.010
Judy and I deal with our marital
problems a little differently...

02:19.369 --> 02:22.830
Counseling, separate
vacations once a year.

02:22.900 --> 02:25.074
She's never pulled a gun on me yet.

02:25.114 --> 02:26.730
I got a shell casing.

02:27.478 --> 02:28.415
Nine millimeter.

02:28.455 --> 02:30.989
That accounts for the
high-velocity spatter.

02:31.608 --> 02:32.684
Where's the husband?

02:32.735 --> 02:36.026
There was no car in the garage.
We can broadcast out for him.

02:36.057 --> 02:38.709
There's no other signs
of disturbance in here.

02:38.719 --> 02:39.926
What about the rest of the house?

02:39.946 --> 02:41.313
Nothing obvious.

02:41.323 --> 02:45.602
How many domestics have you seen where someone got
shot in the face and nothing else was disturbed?

02:46.141 --> 02:47.397
What are you thinking?

02:47.427 --> 02:51.556
That you married people
take things too personally.

03:26.686 --> 03:31.337
She's only been dead a few hours.
Signs of sex prior to death.

03:31.447 --> 03:35.659
No vaginal trauma to
suggest it wasn't amicable.

03:36.179 --> 03:39.970
Assuming the husband had sex
with her and then murdered her,

03:40.011 --> 03:42.921
he went from amorous to
murderous in near record time.

03:42.941 --> 03:45.163
Well, maybe you were right.
It wasn't the husband.

03:45.203 --> 03:48.063
But no semen, so I'd
only be speculating.

03:48.083 --> 03:49.084
What about the bullet?

03:49.124 --> 03:53.476
Single gunshot wound. Based
on powder burns and stipling,

03:53.726 --> 03:56.977
muzzle was placed inside the mouth...

03:57.578 --> 03:59.408
bullet then fragmented in her head.

03:59.428 --> 04:01.319
Explains why warrick
couldn't find it at the scene.

04:01.349 --> 04:03.630
Yeah, shooter wanted to
make sure he didn't miss.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.311
This was somebody who was
emotionally close to her.

04:08.271 --> 04:09.702
Gil...

04:09.862 --> 04:13.284
have you ever even been
close to getting married?

04:14.514 --> 04:15.884
Once.

04:15.945 --> 04:17.355
When I was younger.

04:17.444 --> 04:19.315
Her name was Nicole Daley.

04:20.625 --> 04:22.427
I asked her to marry me.

04:22.677 --> 04:25.738
We were classmates. She liked bugs, too.

04:26.358 --> 04:29.769
I gave her my grandmother's ring,
but my mother made me get it back.

04:31.731 --> 04:33.281
Second grade.

04:36.182 --> 04:37.763
Was it the happiest day of your life?

04:37.793 --> 04:39.723
Me and Tina?

04:40.164 --> 04:43.114
Happened so fast. Time will tell.

04:43.305 --> 04:47.536
Why don't you take a look at this
phone here and tell me what you think.

04:48.807 --> 04:50.998
Blood on the keypad,
away from the spatter.

04:51.028 --> 04:52.579
A neighbor called it in.

04:52.619 --> 04:55.330
If someone was in the house,
they'd have dialed 911.

04:55.350 --> 04:57.450
Dispatch never got a call.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.132
Maybe the husband started to dial...

05:00.151 --> 05:01.602
changed his mind and took off.

05:01.612 --> 05:05.194
Maybe. I just wish it was
a print and not a smudge.

05:06.124 --> 05:06.772
Okay. Bedroom.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.099
Hey.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.950
I found these in his jacket.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.248
Looks like the husband was
planning a little vacation.

06:13.268 --> 06:15.368
A little recreation on the side.

06:15.398 --> 06:17.408
I found this under the bed.

06:17.448 --> 06:19.217
And grass... not the kind you smoke...

06:19.237 --> 06:23.896
on the floor and in the closet, but
all the shoes in the closet were clean.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.976
So someone was walking around
here with grass on their shoes?

06:27.016 --> 06:30.315
Maybe it was the missing
husband, or a desperate gardener.

06:30.345 --> 06:32.634
Who was mowing more than the lawn?

06:36.454 --> 06:37.973
Good call on the grass stains.

06:38.013 --> 06:40.433
Police officers brought in your guy.

06:40.543 --> 06:42.423
He was mowing a lawn down the street.

06:42.453 --> 06:45.832
Well, he must be a great gardener, because
Mrs. Cutler was paying him way too much.

06:46.491 --> 06:48.331
Well... wait till you see him.

06:50.261 --> 06:53.000
Mr. Johnson? It's Timmy, right?

06:54.070 --> 06:56.499
This is Sara Sidle from the crime lab.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.958
I didn't kill Mrs. Cutler, if
that's what you're thinking.

06:58.979 --> 07:00.418
How well do you know her?

07:00.458 --> 07:02.378
We live across the
street from the Cutlers.

07:02.398 --> 07:03.127
We?

07:03.162 --> 07:04.356
My family.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.807
Mother, father, and brothers.

07:05.837 --> 07:06.927
So you still live at home?

07:06.997 --> 07:08.397
Until I graduate next month.

07:08.447 --> 07:11.117
So mowing lawns is just your sideline?

07:11.146 --> 07:14.335
I don't play sports.
Helps with the tuition.

07:14.355 --> 07:17.625
Did Mr. or Mrs. Cutler ever
invite you in their house?

07:18.175 --> 07:20.904
On a cold day, yeah.
Sometimes she'd made me coffee.

07:20.924 --> 07:24.434
But she writes you a check
every month, like yesterday.

07:24.853 --> 07:25.253
Yeah.

07:25.254 --> 07:27.963
Did she hand you the
check in her closet?

07:28.222 --> 07:30.362
Or in her bedroom?

07:35.941 --> 07:37.501
Okay.

07:38.341 --> 07:40.620
Yeah, I was there.

07:41.470 --> 07:42.494
I was hittin' the wife.

07:42.529 --> 07:43.518
You had sex with her?

07:43.519 --> 07:44.899
Yeah.

07:45.119 --> 07:47.768
But it wasn't my idea,
all right? She was...

07:48.308 --> 07:50.688
she was really unhappy in her marriage.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.096
Me and Mrs. Cutler were
in the middle of it when...

07:55.257 --> 07:57.246
when Mr. Cutler came home early.

07:58.926 --> 08:00.976
he was supposed to be at work all night.

08:01.075 --> 08:02.565
Hide!

08:05.156 --> 08:07.316
I guess that's when I lost my sock.

08:12.216 --> 08:15.236
How was she, you little son of
a bitch? Now get out of here.

08:15.305 --> 08:18.486
Mr. Cutler was... was so pissed, I...

08:18.506 --> 08:20.226
I barely even recognized him.

08:20.236 --> 08:21.546
You hear a gunshot?

08:21.576 --> 08:22.576
No.

08:22.607 --> 08:25.667
So Mrs. Cutler was still
alive when you left the house?

08:25.706 --> 08:27.216
I don't know.

08:27.556 --> 08:29.287
I think so.

08:32.236 --> 08:34.157
I didn't see anything else.

09:12.008 --> 09:13.118
So,

09:13.148 --> 09:16.099
I hear your marriage is on the rocks,
and you're shopping for hookers?

09:17.029 --> 09:20.369
No, but I think I found
one that Mr. Cutler likes.

09:20.398 --> 09:24.128
Thumbprint on the front.
Four fingerprints on the back.

09:24.168 --> 09:26.739
"Sally. Sweet apple pie".

09:27.828 --> 09:32.109
Do you really think it's a good idea to
sleep with a girl who advertises in a flyer?

09:32.159 --> 09:35.459
Well, I don't really think
there's any sleeping involved.

09:36.049 --> 09:38.659
Don't be shy, though. Give her a call.

09:40.209 --> 09:43.429
All right, for your enjoyment.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.359
<i>This is Sally. Who's this?</i>

09:51.389 --> 09:54.500
Hi. This is, uh... Dirk... Diggler.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.850
I'm looking for a date.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.370
<i>What kind of date?</i>

09:57.389 --> 10:00.860
I'm taking a trip around
the world. Want to go?

10:00.900 --> 10:03.572
<i>You sure you can afford
the airfare, darlin'?</i>

10:03.632 --> 10:05.137
Is two G's enough?

10:05.157 --> 10:06.592
<i>Where you at?</i>

10:06.622 --> 10:10.414
3057 Westfall. It's
right off of Charleston.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.645
It's a single level building,
all the way in the back.

10:14.026 --> 10:15.611
<i>What do you look like?</i>

10:16.855 --> 10:19.143
I have a little tom cruise thing going.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.909
<i>All right, half an
hour, and I'll be there.</i>

10:20.919 --> 10:22.323
All right.

10:23.678 --> 10:24.308
Yeah, right.

10:24.343 --> 10:26.223
Ah, sweet apple pie!

10:26.224 --> 10:27.119
The cruiser.

10:30.139 --> 10:34.714
Calling me to a crime lab is
cute. It's still entrapment.

10:35.377 --> 10:37.684
Well, you're not here
about prostitution, sweetie.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.039
Really?

10:39.089 --> 10:41.326
No. I need your help with a homicide.

10:41.356 --> 10:43.433
Why don't you go ahead and have a seat?

10:43.453 --> 10:45.560
Thanks.

10:51.199 --> 10:54.199
this man's wife was murdered last night.

10:54.229 --> 10:57.219
His name's Willie Cutler.
Was he ever a client?

10:57.249 --> 10:58.784
We dated.

10:58.844 --> 11:00.148
Yeah.

11:01.423 --> 11:06.299
He was trying to play the, you
know, "I'm a big baller" role.

11:06.429 --> 11:08.275
Do you got a present for me, baby?

11:08.305 --> 11:11.987
He must have won some big jackpot or
something... I can tell when money's new.

11:12.559 --> 11:17.325
He pulled this big wad
out of his wal-mart pants.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.619
But he seemed harmless.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.208
Kind of sweet, actually.

11:27.248 --> 11:29.305
He offered me a deal on a vacation.

11:29.325 --> 11:31.793
Deal? What, like a travel agent?

11:31.823 --> 11:32.936
I don't know.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.421
I guess.

11:34.462 --> 11:36.438
He offered me this.

11:37.903 --> 11:39.799
I've never been to Hawaii.

11:40.702 --> 11:42.518
No...

11:42.819 --> 11:44.695
No, me either.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.718
I'd let you take me to Hawaii.

11:54.618 --> 11:55.812
Yeah, I'm working.

11:55.847 --> 11:57.867
So am I.

12:04.651 --> 12:07.310
"Tour historic Las Vegas".

12:07.350 --> 12:09.397
History in Vegas gets imploded.

12:09.427 --> 12:13.721
It's probably just a drive past the
flamingo where Bugsy Siegel took his leak.

12:13.811 --> 12:17.373
"Closed"? Now wait a
minute. It should be open.

12:18.126 --> 12:20.383
Well, it looks like it is.

12:23.283 --> 12:25.089
Hello?

12:26.453 --> 12:28.149
Anybody here?

12:28.921 --> 12:31.349
Las Vegas police.

12:31.450 --> 12:32.423
Hello?

12:32.453 --> 12:34.128
Catherine.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.349
Control, this is CSI Willows.

12:47.212 --> 12:49.489
We have a 419...

12:49.840 --> 12:52.760
...at 4172 Hamilton.

12:53.001 --> 12:55.730
A business: Neon city excursions.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.780
Suspect may still be on the premises.

13:37.929 --> 13:39.805
Please! Please don't! Don't kill me.

13:39.835 --> 13:42.404
Don't kill me. Don't kill
me. Please, don't kill me.

13:42.424 --> 13:44.149
It's all right, sir.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.939
We're not going to hurt
you; we're the police.

13:57.855 --> 13:59.540
Thanks. I'll take that.

14:00.483 --> 14:04.878
All right, bullet wound. Let's
see what the paramedics left me.

14:07.727 --> 14:11.309
Irregular laceration,
subcutaneous tissue only.

14:11.349 --> 14:14.179
A few millimeters deeper, it would
have nicked the intercostal artery.

14:14.209 --> 14:15.312
That sounds bad.

14:15.342 --> 14:17.750
Yeah. Would've been a real
mess. You're a lucky man.

14:18.021 --> 14:21.091
Flush out the wound,
dress it with 4 x 4 gauze,

14:21.131 --> 14:25.135
start an IV, hang cefazolin
and get some blood work done.

14:25.165 --> 14:28.456
Oh, and get him a tetanus shot.

14:28.666 --> 14:31.616
Ah, the warm fuzzy
feeling of modern medicine.

14:31.897 --> 14:33.482
Can I get something to wear?

14:33.532 --> 14:34.887
Uh, yes, in a few minutes.

14:34.917 --> 14:39.663
I need to document your wound. Do you think
you could lift your arms for me like this?

14:40.616 --> 14:42.652
Thank you. That's perfect.

14:44.077 --> 14:46.244
Why don't you tell us what happened.

14:47.368 --> 14:49.565
Um. Not much to tell, really.

14:49.937 --> 14:53.518
Cowboy Dan had the office working
round the clock for the last week.

14:54.502 --> 14:58.053
We were putting together
a campaign for a new tour.

14:59.307 --> 15:01.324
I just got back from breakfast.

15:01.565 --> 15:03.742
I heard a shot, shouting.

15:10.484 --> 15:13.675
I guess the guy didn't
even know I was there.

15:18.701 --> 15:21.160
I was so scared, I couldn't move.

15:22.163 --> 15:24.430
So I just played dead.

15:28.795 --> 15:31.654
I don't even know how long I was there.

15:32.286 --> 15:34.975
And then you guys came in and found me.

15:35.015 --> 15:38.537
Do you think that you could
indicate on this diagram

15:38.567 --> 15:41.045
where you were standing
when you were shot?

15:43.734 --> 15:46.393
I guess I was standing
somewhere around here.

15:46.734 --> 15:48.149
Thank you.

15:48.269 --> 15:50.035
Look, I really need to call my wife.

15:50.055 --> 15:53.245
I should have been home by
now, and she's probably worried.

15:53.306 --> 15:56.968
Um... Mr. Cutler, when was
the last time you were home?

15:59.095 --> 16:01.091
I guess it was, uh...

16:02.355 --> 16:04.392
probably yesterday morning.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.579
Why?

16:06.810 --> 16:08.295
Mr. Cutler.

16:08.486 --> 16:10.733
I am very sorry, but...

16:10.854 --> 16:12.780
your wife is dead.

16:12.820 --> 16:15.960
She was found shot
last night in your home.

16:18.429 --> 16:20.766
Wh...?

16:40.572 --> 16:43.481
Single GSW to the forehead.

16:45.056 --> 16:47.986
Stipling makes it close range.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.638
At least he died with his boots on.

16:54.106 --> 16:56.404
Cowboy Dan gets it first.

16:56.414 --> 16:58.812
The shooter finds his next target.

16:59.976 --> 17:02.524
shoots him in the back.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.169
That's the vic's desk. He
was getting a promotion.

17:10.902 --> 17:13.380
Well, at least his day
started out on a good note.

17:13.415 --> 17:15.286
Looks like the gun's been wiped clean.

17:15.296 --> 17:16.420
Doubt we'll get any prints.

17:16.450 --> 17:19.400
So what do you got, five
nine-mil shell casings?

17:19.589 --> 17:23.614
Two went back with the body,
three... still in the walls.

17:23.624 --> 17:26.041
So they're all accounted for.

17:36.336 --> 17:38.754
So Willie Cutler must
have been standing along

17:38.784 --> 17:41.653
this line when he was
grazed by the bullet.

17:41.854 --> 17:42.857
Looks about right.

17:42.897 --> 17:45.375
It's consistent with his statement.

17:49.549 --> 17:54.325
and if the shooter never saw him,
he got under the desk really quickly.

17:54.425 --> 17:56.181
I sure would have.

17:56.934 --> 17:58.418
So what do you think, Greg?

17:58.449 --> 18:02.462
Is Willie Cutler the luckiest guy
in the world or the unluckiest?

18:02.472 --> 18:04.920
I wouldn't want his luck either way.

18:08.632 --> 18:10.890
Geez, you lose your wife,

18:10.950 --> 18:15.465
your boss, your co-worker,
all in 24 hours; that's rough.

18:15.896 --> 18:18.234
My heart goes out to you, pal.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.438
Really.

18:19.488 --> 18:20.722
Thank you.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.622
Looks like someone's out to get you.

18:24.535 --> 18:25.598
What do you mean?

18:25.628 --> 18:27.404
Well, the way I see it,

18:27.545 --> 18:31.317
somebody's out to kill you and a lot of
innocent people are getting in the way.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.655
Yeah.

18:34.287 --> 18:35.581
That's got to be it.

18:35.712 --> 18:38.140
Yeah.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.236
Who'd want to kill you?

18:40.287 --> 18:41.761
I don't know.

18:42.765 --> 18:45.052
Maybe it's just some nutcase.

18:45.082 --> 18:48.484
A guy sees me on the street, and
I remind him of somebody he hates.

18:48.564 --> 18:51.624
Yeah, that's... that's
a pretty good theory.

18:51.845 --> 18:53.711
Want to hear another one?

18:55.156 --> 18:56.631
Sure.

18:57.293 --> 19:00.895
Well, this one starts with
your wife banging the lawn boy.

19:02.319 --> 19:03.325
Timmy?

19:03.360 --> 19:04.330
Timmy.

19:05.430 --> 19:06.603
What, you didn't know?

19:06.664 --> 19:07.858
No.

19:08.299 --> 19:09.423
Really?

19:09.433 --> 19:10.857
'Cause according to Timmy,

19:10.868 --> 19:13.045
you found him in the bedroom and
you dragged him out of the closet.

19:13.075 --> 19:15.703
Well, he's lying. 'Cause I wasn't home.

19:15.724 --> 19:19.225
Oh, yeah, that's right. That's right.

19:19.426 --> 19:22.847
You were on the love boat
with Sally the hooker.

19:24.773 --> 19:27.723
Look, my wife and I had some problems.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.790
You know, all married couples do.

19:31.947 --> 19:34.666
I was getting a promotion at work.

19:35.459 --> 19:38.047
At least I thought I was.

19:38.398 --> 19:40.345
So I threw myself a little celebration.

19:40.365 --> 19:43.515
I guess that makes you
a premature celebrator.

19:43.836 --> 19:48.311
Tell me about that work-promotion
thing. Why were you passed up?

19:49.334 --> 19:52.856
Cowboy Dan just couldn't bring
himself to promote a felon.

19:53.127 --> 19:55.334
Yeah, no, I've
- I've read your record. I mean, it's minor league.

19:55.354 --> 19:58.746
I mean, like, joyriding at 19.

19:59.478 --> 20:01.685
Stupid kid stuff.

20:01.715 --> 20:04.093
You know, it follows you
around the rest of your life.

20:04.123 --> 20:05.999
Oh, believe me, I know.

20:06.110 --> 20:09.381
Look, here's what we got
here. Cowboy Dan is dead.

20:09.421 --> 20:12.993
The guy who got your promotion is dead.

20:13.043 --> 20:18.661
It seems to me, that the one with the
most motive to kill in this sad tale...

20:18.772 --> 20:20.557
...is you.

20:21.139 --> 20:22.614
I got shot, too.

20:22.654 --> 20:26.427
Well... you know... kinda.

20:26.457 --> 20:27.741
Look.

20:29.126 --> 20:33.480
last night you wired 50K from your home
equity account to a marker at the lucky dragon.

20:33.490 --> 20:34.223
So?

20:34.253 --> 20:36.390
So, I mean, it wasn't for chinese food.

20:36.590 --> 20:41.125
So maybe you hired a professional killer
to hit your wife, your boss, your coworker.

20:41.155 --> 20:42.349
That's not true!

20:42.359 --> 20:43.945
Told them to take a little, you know,

20:43.975 --> 20:47.276
love bite out of you to, you know, make
you look nice and innocent, you know?

20:47.356 --> 20:49.553
I didn't kill my wife!

20:49.583 --> 20:52.433
I lost this money at the tables.

20:53.897 --> 20:55.553
You know...

20:55.834 --> 20:57.886
this has been the worst day of my life,

20:57.921 --> 21:01.091
and I still haven't had a chance to
see my wife's body... I want to leave.

21:01.101 --> 21:02.074
But we're not done here, Willie.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.559
We're done!

21:03.740 --> 21:07.532
You can't prove that I killed
anybody because I didn't kill anybody.

21:07.593 --> 21:10.422
And if you're not going to
charge me, I'm going to leave.

21:10.432 --> 21:14.285
I want to see my wife's body now!

21:14.305 --> 21:16.041
Well, I pushed the
guy as hard as I could,

21:16.051 --> 21:18.940
but there's a lot of media heat on
this one. I had to cut him loose.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.499
Well, he's got a bullet
wound and a dead wife.

21:21.519 --> 21:23.896
For now, the evidence
says he's a victim.

21:23.917 --> 21:27.087
Well, that's what I told
the unit who's shadowing him.

22:06.015 --> 22:07.019
<i>Sunstar cabs.</i>

22:08.423 --> 22:14.792
Yeah, we had several pickups from
that office park this morning, but, uh,

22:14.828 --> 22:14.828
look, those drivers
are all off right now,

22:15.045 --> 22:17.051
and they take one look at my caller ID,

22:17.052 --> 22:17.854
They ain't pickin' up.

22:17.855 --> 22:19.158
All right, well, what about drop-offs?

22:19.159 --> 22:20.864
Oh, definitely got
something for you there.

22:20.965 --> 22:21.667
Hey, Nicco.

22:21.868 --> 22:22.249
Yeah?

22:22.284 --> 22:23.071
You'll love this.

22:23.072 --> 22:25.389
Nicco, tell these guys
about that guy, huh?

22:26.082 --> 22:27.184
The
drive-around-all-night guy?

22:27.185 --> 22:28.188
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:28.189 --> 22:29.492
Pick him up near Viking

22:29.493 --> 22:32.301
and Pecos around 2:45 a. m.

22:32.302 --> 22:34.300
That's right around the time
Janice Cutler was killed.

22:34.509 --> 22:35.848
It's right near her house.

22:36.616 --> 22:37.545
Is this your cab?

22:37.581 --> 22:38.438
Yeah.

22:38.474 --> 22:39.434
Mind if I take a look?

22:39.469 --> 22:40.393
Okay.

22:40.830 --> 22:41.708
So?

22:43.138 --> 22:44.910
He didn't know where he wanted to go,

22:45.044 --> 22:47.585
but he said I should
drive anyway, so I drive.

22:47.620 --> 22:49.157
He sees a store, he says stop.

22:49.158 --> 22:50.354
Buys a beer.

22:50.389 --> 22:51.364
Then he says, drive, stop,

22:51.365 --> 22:52.969
cigarettes, and drive some more.

22:52.970 --> 22:54.073
I'm all around town.

22:54.074 --> 22:55.779
Five, six hours.

22:55.780 --> 22:56.582
Did you get his name?

22:56.683 --> 22:58.387
Uh... I think it was Sammy.

22:58.388 --> 22:59.290
Yeah.

22:59.291 --> 23:00.896
Yeah, that's what he said.

23:00.897 --> 23:03.104
He asked me to wait for
him by this office place,

23:03.204 --> 23:05.110
but by then it was at
the end of my shift.

23:05.211 --> 23:06.315
I told him,

23:06.716 --> 23:08.320
I got to get home to my wife.

23:08.321 --> 23:09.594
And he asked me,

23:09.595 --> 23:10.527
do I love my wife,

23:10.528 --> 23:12.333
and I told him, hey,

23:12.334 --> 23:13.537
She loves me.

23:13.538 --> 23:14.440
And he said,

23:14.441 --> 23:15.745
I was a lucky man,

23:15.746 --> 23:16.648
which I am.

23:16.649 --> 23:17.552
And he left.

23:17.652 --> 23:19.116
He gave me a big tip.

23:19.458 --> 23:20.871
You need to check this out.

23:22.167 --> 23:23.953
Is that the guy who
called himself Sammy?

23:24.073 --> 23:25.250
Looks a lot like Willie.

23:25.578 --> 23:27.921
Yeah. Yeah, that's the guy.

23:32.501 --> 23:33.681
That's the gun.

23:55.778 --> 23:58.593
So, Willie Cutler had
an older brother, Sammy.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.461
Sammy did time in Chino
for grand theft auto.

24:01.798 --> 24:04.806
Willie had a vehicle-related
felony on his record, too.

24:04.807 --> 24:06.111
Yeah, the same incident.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.319
See, Willie was a first-time
offender, so he pled out.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.422
But Sammy had a record,

24:09.423 --> 24:11.127
so the judge gave him a hard time.

24:11.128 --> 24:13.134
So he got in trouble on the inside.

24:13.135 --> 24:14.639
He did an extended sentence.

24:14.640 --> 24:16.545
He got out six months ago.

24:16.546 --> 24:19.097
I got a fax from the cab
company I want to show you.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.396
Check it out.

24:23.068 --> 24:26.378
They get called out to that office
park where the shooting took place.

24:26.379 --> 24:28.184
Driver said the fare was a no-show.

24:28.185 --> 24:29.689
"Requested destination...

24:29.690 --> 24:31.138
lucky dragon casino".

24:31.596 --> 24:33.501
I sent a unit out to look for Sammy.

24:33.502 --> 24:35.608
You know, this could be a revenge story.

24:35.609 --> 24:36.712
Willie gets a life,

24:36.713 --> 24:37.715
Sammy goes to prison.

24:37.716 --> 24:39.120
Sammy gets out,

24:39.121 --> 24:39.922
tries to get even.

24:39.923 --> 24:41.227
Well, if Sammy was trying to get even,

24:41.228 --> 24:43.034
why did Willie keep quiet about it?

24:43.134 --> 24:44.670
He's his brother's keeper.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.936
It's in the bible.

24:50.558 --> 24:52.578
This is the man that we're looking for.

24:52.866 --> 24:53.969
Please keep your eyes peeled.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.675
He may have been here last night.

24:56.177 --> 24:58.885
I want you to cover every
square inch of this place.

24:58.886 --> 25:00.892
Let's spread out; let's move it.

25:05.006 --> 25:06.906
So, this is Sammy Cutler.

25:08.217 --> 25:09.890
This is his mug shot.

25:10.123 --> 25:12.731
It's a few years old,

25:12.732 --> 25:15.326
and this is what he looks like now.

25:17.949 --> 25:19.035
Hey, Sara,

25:19.253 --> 25:21.158
you're working the
office shooting, right?

25:21.159 --> 25:22.849
Yeah, and the dead wife.

25:23.066 --> 25:25.372
Autopsy reports on the two DB's.

25:25.373 --> 25:26.877
Grissom wanted them asap,

25:26.878 --> 25:28.182
and I was in the neighborhood.

25:28.183 --> 25:28.784
Thanks.

25:28.785 --> 25:30.077
I'll pass them along.

25:32.095 --> 25:33.994
Somebody at the office get knifed?

25:34.905 --> 25:36.092
No.

25:36.109 --> 25:37.914
Kind of looks like a knife wound.

25:37.915 --> 25:39.218
Victim survived the shooting.

25:39.219 --> 25:42.128
He said he was grazed by a stray bullet.

25:42.129 --> 25:43.395
Really?

25:45.740 --> 25:49.351
This is an irregular laceration
with no defining features.

25:49.352 --> 25:53.801
A grazing GSW is usually accompanied
by some marginal abrasion.

25:53.867 --> 25:54.970
There's none here.

25:54.971 --> 25:59.372
Any idea what might have
caused a wound like this?

25:59.408 --> 25:59.408
Yeah, lots of things.

25:59.586 --> 26:01.201
Something sharp.

26:04.302 --> 26:06.901
What's this blue discoloration?

26:09.519 --> 26:11.324
Kind of looks like ink.

26:11.325 --> 26:12.754
Doesn't it?

26:19.351 --> 26:21.458
Catherine found this
under Willie Cutler's desk.

26:21.559 --> 26:23.755
Thought the blood was incidental.

26:36.107 --> 26:38.541
Sodium rhodizonate is negative.

26:38.916 --> 26:40.821
No lead in the tear.

26:40.822 --> 26:41.724
No bullet.

26:41.725 --> 26:45.809
So, Willie tried to make
it look like he was shot.

26:46.441 --> 26:48.136
Grabs a ball point pin.

26:49.150 --> 26:52.209
drags it across his ribs.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.146
Did I miss something?

27:01.490 --> 27:02.871
Don't know.

27:03.698 --> 27:05.201
We'll find out.

27:08.112 --> 27:10.419
We've been running a major
poker tournament here all week.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.426
You know what the loser gets?

27:12.427 --> 27:14.097
Baseball caps.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.629
There's about 400 of
them down there right now.

27:17.343 --> 27:18.714
Keep looking.

27:39.917 --> 27:40.719
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

27:40.720 --> 27:41.622
What's up?

27:41.623 --> 27:43.027
<i>Nothin' much.</i>

27:43.128 --> 27:44.415
Where you at?

27:44.532 --> 27:45.936
<i>I'm at the venetian.</i>

27:45.937 --> 27:48.444
Canyon ranch, getting a...

27:48.445 --> 27:49.849
manicure.

27:49.850 --> 27:53.796
Hope you're in for a good back
scratching session tonight.

27:53.831 --> 27:53.831
Who you talking about?

27:54.265 --> 27:55.267
What?

27:55.268 --> 27:57.250
Me or the guy standing next to you?

27:57.876 --> 27:58.477
<i>Look up.</i>

27:58.478 --> 27:59.988
<i>You see that little
dome above your head?</i>

28:00.485 --> 28:01.921
Give it a wave.

28:01.956 --> 28:03.193
That's me in the surveillance room,

28:03.194 --> 28:05.044
watching you lie to me.

28:06.003 --> 28:07.006
<i>Warrick...</i>

28:07.007 --> 28:09.414
Man, and I didn't even have
to call that show cheaters.

28:09.415 --> 28:10.919
You think you know what
you're talking about?

28:10.920 --> 28:12.224
Don't even bother coming home tonight.

28:12.324 --> 28:15.333
I'll just text you the storage
space your stuff'll be in.

28:15.334 --> 28:16.638
You want to know what's up, huh?

28:16.939 --> 28:17.841
What's really up?

28:17.842 --> 28:18.945
I can see what's up.

28:18.946 --> 28:21.253
<i>You can't see a damn thing.</i>

28:21.254 --> 28:25.064
He's a VIP host helping me
plan your birthday party.

28:25.066 --> 28:26.964
I hope you enjoy spending it alone.

28:51.955 --> 28:53.026
Well, hey.

28:53.059 --> 28:54.287
What are you doing?

28:54.965 --> 28:55.967
Serology.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.248
Serology?

28:57.270 --> 29:00.698
Now, I read about that in my
history of forensic science classes.

29:00.884 --> 29:03.793
So, what exactly is
it you're trying to do?

29:03.794 --> 29:07.102
Lattes crust method for
determining blood type.

29:07.306 --> 29:09.412
You know, for you, I clear the decks.

29:09.413 --> 29:13.350
I mean, I can just rush
your samples through DNA.

29:13.827 --> 29:15.911
I need it faster than DNA.

29:16.436 --> 29:21.186
And I don't need a full
profile anyway, just ABO type.

29:21.190 --> 29:21.922
You mind if I stick around and watch?

29:21.953 --> 29:23.257
Don't you have something better to do?

29:23.258 --> 29:24.160
Yeah, I do,

29:24.161 --> 29:26.655
but some guy's using my lab.

29:29.880 --> 29:30.682
Okay, now as I recall,

29:30.683 --> 29:32.187
the reagents have to be fresh.

29:32.188 --> 29:33.090
Right? So,

29:33.091 --> 29:34.795
where did you get those?

29:34.796 --> 29:37.103
I keep some in my
fridge for emergencies.

29:37.104 --> 29:38.809
You got anything else in there?

29:38.810 --> 29:40.514
Bottle of tequila, perhaps?

29:40.515 --> 29:42.065
Severed head?

29:43.826 --> 29:45.347
I don't keep tequila.

30:32.186 --> 30:35.696
Jim, you have to bring in Willie Cutler.

30:35.697 --> 30:36.399
Willie got loose.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.022
He slipped our surveillance.

30:38.607 --> 30:39.208
What's up?

30:39.209 --> 30:43.690
<i>We found high velocity spatter
consistent with the wife on his shirt.</i>

30:43.724 --> 30:45.520
He was in the room when she was shot.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.523
He could have been holding the gun.

30:47.637 --> 30:49.079
<i>Maybe they were working together.</i>

30:49.543 --> 30:52.754
That would explain what Sammy
was doing at the lucky dragon.

30:52.854 --> 30:54.199
Willie lost a lot of money there.

30:54.359 --> 30:55.461
So either he did it,

30:55.462 --> 30:56.989
or he's covering for his brother.

30:57.068 --> 30:57.841
Yeah.

30:57.870 --> 30:59.648
<i>Maybe he's got
unfinished business there.</i>

31:15.127 --> 31:16.933
Ow! Man, what the hell is your problem?

31:17.034 --> 31:17.699
Just get out of my way.

31:17.734 --> 31:18.365
Oh, you're a tough guy?

31:18.400 --> 31:20.244
Go ahead and go through
me then if you...

31:20.445 --> 31:21.183
You think you want some of this, huh?

31:21.218 --> 31:23.013
Tough guy, huh?

31:23.154 --> 31:25.261
Hey, break it up, break it up!

31:26.364 --> 31:27.167
Hey, aren't you...?

31:31.281 --> 31:32.284
Shots fired. Main floor.

31:32.384 --> 31:33.689
BJ pit three...

31:43.822 --> 31:45.929
Get out of my way!

31:48.939 --> 31:49.641
Hey! Hey!

31:49.742 --> 31:50.444
Get off of me!

31:50.845 --> 31:52.049
What are you doing? Help!

31:52.250 --> 31:55.059
Help! Help me!

32:12.617 --> 32:14.340
This is a radio check. Do you read me?

32:15.928 --> 32:16.264
Copy that.

32:18.135 --> 32:19.714
Kill word is "Jim".

32:25.861 --> 32:26.463
Hello?

32:26.764 --> 32:27.866
Hey, Willie.

32:27.867 --> 32:30.074
It's me, uh, Jim Brass.

32:30.075 --> 32:31.177
Remember me?

32:31.580 --> 32:33.253
<i>Guess what? I'm right outside your door.</i>

32:33.386 --> 32:35.209
I will blow her head off.

32:35.493 --> 32:36.696
I'll blow both our heads straight off.

32:36.697 --> 32:38.000
You understand me?!

32:38.001 --> 32:39.404
Look, I understand.

32:39.405 --> 32:40.508
I understand, Willie, I do.

32:40.509 --> 32:41.712
Look, I just...

32:41.713 --> 32:44.321
I just want this to end peacefully.

32:44.322 --> 32:45.437
<i>For everybody.</i>

32:45.472 --> 32:46.227
I'm not coming out.

32:46.228 --> 32:47.732
Oh, I don't want you
to come out, Willie.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.307
I want you to let me in.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.507
Look, I'm not armed.

32:55.258 --> 32:56.461
Look through the peep hole.

32:56.462 --> 32:57.865
Why do you want to come in here?

32:57.866 --> 32:59.471
Just to talk to you, Willie.

32:59.472 --> 33:00.374
<i>I mean, you're a smart guy,</i>

33:00.375 --> 33:01.477
<i>I think maybe you and I,</i>

33:01.478 --> 33:02.982
<i>we can figure a way out of this.</i>

33:02.983 --> 33:04.889
Come on, check me out.

33:04.890 --> 33:05.691
Okay, look,

33:05.692 --> 33:07.196
I'm going to put the phone down now,

33:07.197 --> 33:09.798
so you can see me, okay?

33:17.531 --> 33:20.790
Look... no gun.

33:31.778 --> 33:32.662
Hey, Willie.

33:33.384 --> 33:34.185
It's me.

33:34.186 --> 33:36.694
I'm alone, and I'm unarmed.

33:36.694 --> 33:37.468
Close that door.

33:41.912 --> 33:44.419
Either I walk out here
right now, or she dies.

33:44.420 --> 33:47.228
Look... nobody's going to die, Willie.

33:47.229 --> 33:49.035
Not you, not her,

33:49.136 --> 33:51.885
not me, not Sammy, not anyone.

33:53.851 --> 33:54.954
You sure about that?

33:54.955 --> 33:55.656
Oh, yeah,

33:55.657 --> 33:56.760
I'm sure about that.

33:56.761 --> 33:58.164
Then I want to talk to my brother.

33:58.165 --> 33:59.168
Okay, I can arrange that.

33:59.169 --> 34:00.773
We have him in custody downstairs.

34:00.774 --> 34:01.576
You're lying!

34:01.577 --> 34:03.272
Hey, you got the gun.

34:03.282 --> 34:05.255
I'm not... I wouldn't lie to you.

34:05.389 --> 34:07.537
But I need you to do something for me.

34:07.897 --> 34:10.992
I need you to let this woman go,

34:11.610 --> 34:13.715
and I'll dial up your
brother downstairs.

34:14.920 --> 34:15.522
Where is he?

34:15.523 --> 34:16.826
He's in the holding room,

34:16.827 --> 34:19.007
which is in the basement of the casino.

34:19.837 --> 34:21.239
He was just trying to help me.

34:21.241 --> 34:22.745
Look, I'm just trying
to help you too, Willie.

34:22.746 --> 34:24.250
Point the gun at me, not at her,

34:24.251 --> 34:26.157
and let this nice young woman go,

34:26.158 --> 34:26.958
come on.

34:26.960 --> 34:27.462
No way.

34:27.562 --> 34:29.119
Point the gun at me, Willie.

34:29.155 --> 34:30.170
You really have my brother?

34:30.170 --> 34:31.574
Yeah, I'm gonna call... hold on.

34:31.576 --> 34:32.879
I want to talk to him.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.061
Hold on.

34:39.000 --> 34:39.946
Brown.

34:40.003 --> 34:41.074
This is Brass.

34:41.107 --> 34:44.317
Look, I need you to get
Samuel Cutler on the phone.

34:44.318 --> 34:45.320
I'm here with his brother, Willie,

34:45.321 --> 34:46.223
and he'd like to talk to him.

34:46.224 --> 34:48.231
So, could you go down
to the holding room

34:48.331 --> 34:51.239
and get Samuel Cutler on
the line and call me back?

34:51.341 --> 34:52.744
Are you with Willie right now?

34:52.745 --> 34:54.149
Yes, I'm with him,

34:54.150 --> 34:55.754
and he'd like to speak with his brother.

34:55.755 --> 34:57.561
We're still looking
for him in surveillance.

34:57.662 --> 34:58.865
It could take some time.

34:58.866 --> 34:59.768
How much time?

34:59.769 --> 35:02.001
I don't see his face, she dies!

35:02.036 --> 35:02.477
Okay, okay, okay.

35:02.478 --> 35:03.599
Look, look.

35:03.782 --> 35:07.393
I need you to get Samuel Cutler
up here as soon as possible.

35:07.394 --> 35:09.199
Okay, Brass, we're
doing the best we can.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.102
I want you to hang in there,

35:10.103 --> 35:11.306
take care of yourself.

35:11.307 --> 35:12.209
If he's in this casino,

35:12.210 --> 35:13.814
we're going to find him.

35:13.815 --> 35:14.783
Thank you.

35:15.822 --> 35:16.738
He'll be here.

35:17.026 --> 35:17.727
Okay?

35:17.728 --> 35:20.436
Now, I just want you
to point the gun at me.

35:20.437 --> 35:21.238
That's good.

35:21.239 --> 35:22.242
Not at her.

35:22.243 --> 35:24.382
That's it... cause it's just
you and me now, all right?

35:24.450 --> 35:25.965
I'm the hostage, all right?

35:29.065 --> 35:30.029
What's your name?

35:30.069 --> 35:30.961
Jackie.

35:31.072 --> 35:31.773
Jackie.

35:31.774 --> 35:33.267
It's going to be okay, Jackie.

35:33.580 --> 35:34.984
It's going to be okay, Willie.

35:34.985 --> 35:36.826
It's just you and me now.

35:36.891 --> 35:39.758
This is all going to be over soon.

35:48.530 --> 35:50.435
Oh, yesterday,

35:50.436 --> 35:52.341
I spent $5,000 on a hooker

35:52.342 --> 35:56.045
because I thought I was
getting a $15,000 promotion.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.859
When I went to work,

35:57.860 --> 36:02.274
I got the news that
I'd been "passed over".

36:02.275 --> 36:04.581
So now you're five
large in the hole, hmm?

36:04.582 --> 36:05.284
Well, way I saw it,

36:05.285 --> 36:07.115
I was 15 in the hole.

36:07.693 --> 36:09.096
So I went to a cash machine

36:09.097 --> 36:11.430
and I wired myself 50K.

36:11.606 --> 36:13.219
Every cent I own.

36:14.214 --> 36:15.116
For a second I was up,

36:15.117 --> 36:16.652
I was killin' em.

36:16.923 --> 36:19.129
They were serving me cocktails,

36:19.130 --> 36:21.166
and calling me "sir".

36:22.241 --> 36:23.945
And then the pit boss got involved

36:23.946 --> 36:25.651
and I hit a bad streak.

36:25.652 --> 36:27.364
So I called Sammy.

36:30.769 --> 36:32.675
Bust, bust, bust, bust!

36:32.776 --> 36:34.682
Damn it! God!

36:34.882 --> 36:36.568
Ah, God!

36:37.993 --> 36:39.817
What? What?

36:40.100 --> 36:40.500
Willie?

36:40.535 --> 36:40.901
What?

36:40.902 --> 36:42.152
Let me get you out of here.

36:45.317 --> 36:46.949
What happened when you got home?

36:49.531 --> 36:50.748
Things got worse.

36:51.036 --> 36:52.266
I lost everything.

36:52.641 --> 36:54.183
Our entire savings.

36:54.648 --> 36:55.249
I'm sorry.

36:55.250 --> 36:56.922
You stupid lowlife.

36:57.658 --> 36:59.362
That was my money, too!

36:59.363 --> 37:01.168
You are such a loser.

37:01.169 --> 37:03.324
Just like your degenerate brother.

37:08.493 --> 37:11.502
Sammy told me to stay put,

37:11.503 --> 37:13.840
and he said I should clean up the mess.

37:15.216 --> 37:16.619
He said he was going to take care of me.

37:16.620 --> 37:17.622
Why didn't you call the cops?

37:17.623 --> 37:18.963
I can't turn him in.

37:20.031 --> 37:22.036
And I knew I'd get blamed.

37:29.262 --> 37:32.070
Willie Cutler's marker was
signed by a blackjack pit boss,

37:32.071 --> 37:34.201
this is last night's surveillance.

37:43.710 --> 37:46.317
So the pit boss gives
Willie the heave-ho,

37:46.318 --> 37:47.943
with chips still on the table.

37:47.978 --> 37:50.932
Yeah, that's about a $10,000 marker.

37:50.933 --> 37:52.136
Casino owed him money,

37:52.137 --> 37:53.642
that's why Willie went back.

37:53.743 --> 37:55.357
And what about Sammy?

37:56.652 --> 37:57.854
I haven't seen him.

38:00.264 --> 38:02.270
I tried to find him myself.

38:02.271 --> 38:05.581
I figured I could get him
to Mexico or something.

38:05.582 --> 38:08.390
I drove around for hours.

38:08.391 --> 38:09.781
Nothing.

38:11.401 --> 38:13.114
So I went back to my office,

38:14.712 --> 38:17.072
and that's when I saw
cowboy Dan and Roger.

38:19.327 --> 38:20.329
And I knew what Sammy meant

38:20.330 --> 38:22.901
when he said he was
going to take care of me.

38:24.043 --> 38:25.754
He was going to give me a clean slate.

38:26.752 --> 38:28.924
He was going to kill
everyone that wronged me.

38:28.959 --> 38:30.463
But she hasn't wronged you.

38:30.464 --> 38:32.652
Jackie hasn't done anything to hurt you.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.877
So why would you want to hurt her?

38:34.878 --> 38:36.104
Let's cut her loose.

38:37.989 --> 38:39.693
I don't want to hurt anybody.

38:39.694 --> 38:41.800
That's right, Willie.

38:41.801 --> 38:43.975
You don't want to hurt anybody.

38:44.109 --> 38:45.713
You kill somebody,

38:45.714 --> 38:47.519
even by accident,

38:47.520 --> 38:49.422
you can never take it back.

38:49.426 --> 38:51.971
People never look at
you the same way again.

38:52.537 --> 38:53.721
And you know what?

38:54.644 --> 38:57.205
You can't look at yourself
the same way again, either.

38:59.259 --> 39:00.075
Griss?

39:00.262 --> 39:01.064
You got to see this.

39:01.065 --> 39:03.584
I found it on the internet.

39:13.807 --> 39:15.448
Me and Sammy?

39:17.017 --> 39:18.722
We used to be so tight.

39:19.927 --> 39:21.622
And that stupid car.

39:23.138 --> 39:25.244
He always felt so guilty
about dragging me into that,

39:25.245 --> 39:26.949
but it wasn't his fault.

39:26.950 --> 39:28.153
He wasn't to blame.

39:28.154 --> 39:28.656
Well...

39:29.559 --> 39:30.963
Just the phone.

39:30.963 --> 39:31.612
Just the phone.

39:32.167 --> 39:33.269
Take it easy.

39:39.893 --> 39:40.845
Yeah.

39:40.880 --> 39:41.798
Jim?

39:41.799 --> 39:43.551
Sammy Cutler's dead.

39:43.906 --> 39:47.517
<i>He died in a car crash
in Mexico two months ago.</i>

39:47.518 --> 39:48.721
<i>Willie had to know.</i>

39:48.722 --> 39:50.126
<i>He's been playing us.</i>

39:50.127 --> 39:52.542
I got it, yeah. Thanks.

39:58.856 --> 40:00.173
Hey, Willie.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.552
Sammy's not coming up.

40:04.875 --> 40:06.697
But I guess we both know that, right?

40:08.086 --> 40:09.144
Yeah.

40:11.196 --> 40:13.167
It's a good thing I have the gun.
