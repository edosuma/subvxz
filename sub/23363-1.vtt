02:32.670 --> 02:34.970
Do you think
we did it this time?

02:37.640 --> 02:38.710
Yes.

02:40.070 --> 02:41.970
I think we did.

04:12.930 --> 04:14.800
Gi, your sister's
on the phone.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.540
Okay.
I'll be right there.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.070
You know,
I managed to stop.

04:21.070 --> 04:24.740
I know. I'm gonna stop.
I'm gonna stop.

04:24.740 --> 04:26.680
Dr. Hughes
is gonna smell it.

04:37.220 --> 04:40.290
<i>Hey. Just calling to wish
you luck at the doctor's today.</i>

04:40.290 --> 04:43.560
- <i>How are you feeling?</i>
- I'm good. I'm excited.

04:44.530 --> 04:45.530
What's wrong?

04:47.730 --> 04:50.070
I just can't stop thinking
about them.

04:50.070 --> 04:51.140
<i>About Mom and Dad?</i>

04:52.240 --> 04:53.570
Yeah.

04:55.280 --> 04:58.040
'Cause they were
the last thing I saw.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.880
Geen...

04:59.880 --> 05:02.850
My love,
we need to leave.

05:02.850 --> 05:05.720
Um... James says
we have to go.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.150
- Okay. I'm coming.
- <i>Okay, okay.</i>

05:07.150 --> 05:09.850
Well, I'm thinking about you,
and I love you.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.860
I love you more. Bye.

08:53.910 --> 08:57.220
And try to keep your eye
open for about 15 seconds.

09:02.990 --> 09:04.220
Okay.

09:05.530 --> 09:08.360
I see no
reason not to do this.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.230
I'll restore optical
properties of the right eye.

09:11.230 --> 09:14.230
A corneal transplantation,
iris reconstruction

09:14.230 --> 09:16.400
and intraocular
lens implantation.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.370
But you definitely
can't do the left?

09:18.370 --> 09:22.010
The optic nerve in the left eye was
severely damaged in the crash.

09:22.010 --> 09:24.010
It won't transmit the picture
to the brain.

09:24.010 --> 09:25.940
But I'll be able to see
fully with my right eye?

09:25.940 --> 09:28.480
You'll be able to
count fingers on day one.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.450
On day three,
20 over 200.

09:31.450 --> 09:34.020
By week four,
you should be at 20/50.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.590
That's terrific.

09:41.590 --> 09:43.590
Come on, it's more than terrific.
That's amazing, huh?

09:43.600 --> 09:45.830
That is amazing.

09:46.970 --> 09:48.400
That is the best news!

09:48.400 --> 09:50.840
There's no risk to Gina,
though, in the operation?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.840
The only risk
is that it won't work.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.370
Yep. And if it doesn't work?

09:54.370 --> 09:56.570
We'll just go back
to how we were.

09:56.580 --> 09:58.380
It's fine, James.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.380
How soon can this happen?

10:00.380 --> 10:02.450
Well, there is
a waiting list.

10:02.450 --> 10:05.350
But as soon as a date becomes
available, I will call you.

- You what?
- Jill was gonna put her down.

18:22.880 --> 18:25.920
- Why?
- She's having a baby.

18:25.920 --> 18:29.420

down because you're having a baby.

23:55.080 --> 23:58.020
10, 9...

24:05.720 --> 24:07.320
<i>Gina!</i>

24:13.100 --> 24:16.470
<i>- Girls.
- Who wants ice cream?</i>

24:26.380 --> 24:27.910
Gina!

24:59.910 --> 25:02.210
Hi. Hello, Gina.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.910
Hi.

25:03.910 --> 25:05.706
All right. I'm gonna
take the bandages off.

25:05.718 --> 25:06.320
Okay.

25:08.490 --> 25:10.450
Now, this is gonna be just
a little uncomfortable.

25:10.460 --> 25:12.060
Okay.

25:23.970 --> 25:25.440
- Keep your eyes closed.
- Okay.

25:37.150 --> 25:39.020
Okay. Open your
eyes now, please.

25:46.220 --> 25:48.130
Can you see
my hand?

25:52.500 --> 25:53.500
Mmm.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.400
Kind of?

25:57.840 --> 26:00.200
I think... I-I think so.
I don't know.

26:00.210 --> 26:01.470
Open the curtain.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.110
This may
feel a little bright.

26:08.350 --> 26:09.520
A little more.

26:13.350 --> 26:14.390
Gina?

26:16.390 --> 26:18.520
Geen.

26:18.520 --> 26:19.960
Gina?

26:20.960 --> 26:23.160
You know what?
No. It's okay.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.590
We tried. Hmm?

26:40.140 --> 26:41.380
- Promise?
- Yes.

26:41.380 --> 26:44.550
I love you so much.

26:49.990 --> 26:51.260
Yes.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.070
- Yeah?
- I can see.

27:12.310 --> 27:14.410
Food tastes
different.

27:14.410 --> 27:15.810
Well,
it's hospital food.

27:17.150 --> 27:19.050
I have taken that
into account.

27:27.960 --> 27:30.330
Can I ask
a silly question?

27:30.330 --> 27:33.100
- What?
- Have you seen yourself yet?

27:38.370 --> 27:39.870
Why not?

27:44.010 --> 27:45.240
You're beautiful.

27:48.980 --> 27:50.880
Really, really beautiful.

28:02.460 --> 28:04.860
You look different than
what I had in my head.

28:06.160 --> 28:09.000
- Disappointed?
- No, I didn't mean it bad, baby.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.370
- I know, I know.
- I just mean different.

28:10.370 --> 28:11.370
Yeah.

28:13.370 --> 28:14.510
Good "different."

28:24.050 --> 28:28.120
<i>Dr. Wanchai,
please dial extension number 278.</i>

30:42.790 --> 30:46.250
These are antibiotic drops.

30:46.260 --> 30:48.390
You need to put these
in your eyes

30:48.390 --> 30:50.530
five times a day
for the next 15 days.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.100
- This is important.
- I know. I'm listening.

30:55.100 --> 30:57.570
- Sorry.
- These are steroid drops.

30:57.570 --> 31:00.140
- They need to be taken every other hour.
- Mm-hmm.

31:00.140 --> 31:02.210
We'll taper the dosage
as we go, okay?

31:02.210 --> 31:03.370
Yep.

31:03.370 --> 31:05.270
- Blue are the steroids. Yes?
- Yeah.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.550
Now, take
your wife home.

31:09.510 --> 31:10.780
Watch your step.

31:43.410 --> 31:45.580
Babe.

31:45.580 --> 31:48.280
- Huh?
- Baby, look at all the colors.

31:48.290 --> 31:49.590
I know.
I know.

31:52.460 --> 31:54.690
- That's blue.
- Mm-hmm.

31:54.690 --> 31:56.590
It's just there.
It's right there.

31:58.700 --> 32:02.400
What do you want to do? Where do you
want to go? What do you want to see?

32:09.870 --> 32:12.840
- I just want colors.
- Lots of colors.

32:16.250 --> 32:18.250
All right.
I know the perfect place.

32:18.250 --> 32:20.580
You want to see
some colors?

32:22.620 --> 32:24.420

Excuse me. Sorry.

34:13.030 --> 34:15.300
Hi, Ginger.

34:15.300 --> 34:16.600
Hey, say hello
to Mommy.

34:16.600 --> 34:19.600
Hi, baby. Come on.
Come here.

34:20.870 --> 34:23.610
Oh, you are ugly.

34:30.420 --> 34:31.620
What?

34:33.449 --> 34:36.760
I just for... I forgot
what my name looked like.

35:15.790 --> 35:17.400
Okay,
what's the matter?

35:19.500 --> 35:22.970
It's just, this is not
how I imagined it, is all.

36:18.520 --> 36:19.820
What's going on?

36:20.760 --> 36:22.130
I don't know.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.570
I just feel like I knew
everything before. You know?

36:31.200 --> 36:33.000
Now I don't.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.010
I've got a surprise.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.180
What?
What is that?

36:42.180 --> 36:44.120
Tickets. Flights.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.550
South of Spain.

36:47.550 --> 36:51.120
I got us the exact same suite
we had on our honeymoon.

36:52.190 --> 36:53.890
Are you serious?

36:53.890 --> 36:57.660
Then we get a train to
Barcelona to see your sister.

36:57.660 --> 36:59.130
Stop.

36:59.130 --> 37:00.830
- And then Luca.
- Stop it.

37:00.830 --> 37:03.770
- And Ramon.
- Wait, can... Can I even travel?

37:03.770 --> 37:05.700
I spoke to the doctor.
Everything's all good.

37:05.700 --> 37:07.410
We're clear to go.
We leave in three days.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.040
Huh? I know!

37:17.750 --> 37:20.480
Look at me.
Look at me.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.750
- I am.
- Come on.

37:21.750 --> 37:22.750
I am.

37:28.590 --> 37:29.660
What?

37:39.040 --> 37:40.570
Hey, what's wrong?

37:40.570 --> 37:42.470
Hang on. Just one second, please.
One second.

37:44.010 --> 37:45.880
Do you want to do
anything different?

37:45.880 --> 37:48.580
No, it's not you. It's not you.
It's just...

37:51.110 --> 37:52.650
It's just...

38:27.220 --> 38:29.250
We'll be
in touch soon.

38:29.250 --> 38:30.820
- You'll call me?
- Yes.

38:46.140 --> 38:48.000
- Kitten, what are you doing?
- I'm coming.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.110
I'm just taking
my drops.

38:50.110 --> 38:51.840
Come on.
We gotta get going.

38:51.840 --> 38:52.880
Okay.

39:23.940 --> 39:25.840
- There we are.
- What is that?

39:41.960 --> 39:43.590
Are you gonna buy me one?

39:45.060 --> 39:46.330
Yeah?
You want one?

40:01.180 --> 40:02.950
Blue is
my favorite color.

40:23.730 --> 40:26.100
- Do you remember it, the grass?
- Hmm?

40:26.100 --> 40:28.400
- No?
- No. I remember that sound.

40:28.410 --> 40:29.980
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:36.380 --> 40:37.910
And voilà.

40:37.920 --> 40:40.110
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Just here.

40:40.120 --> 40:41.290
This is great.
Thank you.

40:42.190 --> 40:44.290
Uh, all right.

40:51.430 --> 40:53.130
It's beautiful.

41:03.040 --> 41:06.780
- It's not the same.
- What's not the same?

41:06.780 --> 41:07.401
The room.

41:07.413 --> 41:09.310
It's the exact same room
we had on our honeymoon.

41:09.310 --> 41:10.880
- No, it's not.
- It is.

41:10.880 --> 41:13.480
I know you asked for it,
but they didn't give it to you.

41:13.480 --> 41:15.050
You couldn't have seen it.
You were blind.

41:15.050 --> 41:16.480
What's it have to do
with anything?

41:16.490 --> 41:20.320
- How could you tell this is not the same?
- How could <i>you</i> tell?

41:20.320 --> 41:21.960
- I was here, remember?
- Oh, okay.

41:21.960 --> 41:25.260
It's the exact same room.
Trust me.

41:25.260 --> 41:26.461
It's exactly the same.

41:26.473 --> 41:28.900
It may look the same,
but it's not the same.

41:35.870 --> 41:38.240
You're not even a little
bit scared up here?

41:38.240 --> 41:39.740
It's fine.

41:41.080 --> 41:42.680
- Oh!
- Whoa, whoa. Okay.

41:50.920 --> 41:53.090
How many would you like?
One each or one to share?

41:53.090 --> 41:55.020
- We're gonna share.
- Two. No, one each.

41:55.020 --> 41:56.890
No. We only had one
last time.

41:56.890 --> 41:58.260
- Two, please.
- One.

41:58.260 --> 41:59.330
Two. Two.

42:38.840 --> 42:39.970
Gina!

42:49.510 --> 42:51.120
Gina!

43:34.120 --> 43:35.490
Oh, my God.

43:35.490 --> 43:38.230
I send you away and that's
what you come up with?

43:38.230 --> 43:40.330
Who was the guy
you were talking to?

43:40.330 --> 43:41.118
It was Ollie.

43:41.130 --> 43:43.530
He must be European.
He likes a bit of white.

43:43.530 --> 43:45.430
Yeah.
He really does.

43:45.440 --> 43:46.043
Who is he?

43:46.055 --> 43:47.900
He and his wife are
here on their honeymoon.

43:47.900 --> 43:50.010
They're in the room
we were in last time.

43:50.010 --> 43:53.040
- You can't let it go, can you?
- Ask the manager.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.310
- Go on. He's right there.
- Why would I ask the manager?

43:55.310 --> 43:57.950
- Ask him. He's the manager.
- No, no. No, no.

43:57.950 --> 44:00.450
- You could just ask him.
- We're fine. I already asked him.

44:02.520 --> 44:03.950
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

44:03.950 --> 44:04.950
And?

44:06.220 --> 44:08.230
It's not the same room.

44:09.160 --> 44:11.060
When were you gonna tell me?

44:12.460 --> 44:13.630
- Truthfully?
- Uh-huh.

44:13.630 --> 44:15.330
Never.

44:16.430 --> 44:18.470
Well, I forgive you.

44:34.180 --> 44:36.350
Jesus Christ.

44:39.390 --> 44:40.960
They can't see us,
can they?

44:42.360 --> 44:44.230
Maybe they like
being watched.

44:49.930 --> 44:52.100
Ai-yi-yi. Come on. You
don't want to see that.

45:18.560 --> 45:19.900
Mmm.

45:25.970 --> 45:28.540
- Talk to me.
- Shh. Just feel me.

45:29.470 --> 45:32.140
Untie me.
Just untie me.

45:32.140 --> 45:34.540
- Let me get my hands on you.
- Stop.

45:35.710 --> 45:37.110
Oh, fuck.

45:37.110 --> 45:41.020
You can feel me better
when you can't see me.

45:41.020 --> 45:43.590
Come on, just untie me.
Let me have one hand.

45:43.590 --> 45:45.690
You get to feel
what it's like.

45:45.690 --> 45:48.360
Come on.

45:48.360 --> 45:51.360
What's the point of wearing something
like that if I can't see you?

45:51.360 --> 45:53.460
You don't need to see, baby.
Use your imagination.

45:53.460 --> 45:56.100
Oh, God.

45:56.100 --> 45:59.130
- Come on.
- I just want to get my hands on you.

45:59.140 --> 46:02.200
What do you think about
when you jerk off?

46:02.210 --> 46:06.140
- Hmm?
- I think about you.

46:06.140 --> 46:08.450
- Always?
- Always.

46:11.150 --> 46:13.380
Huh?
What do you think about?

46:13.380 --> 46:17.590
- I think about you.
- Just me? And what else?

46:17.590 --> 46:20.260
- Just men.
- Really?

46:20.260 --> 46:23.060
Yeah,
just bodies and dicks.

46:23.060 --> 46:25.360
And dicks. So you
don't think about me?

46:25.360 --> 46:27.460
- Come on. Stop that.
- So you do think about other people?

46:27.460 --> 46:30.130
- Are you trying to trick me?
- No, I'm not trying to trick you.

46:30.130 --> 46:33.070
- Hey, baby...
- No, don't turn this around.

46:33.070 --> 46:35.800
I feel stupid enough as it is, okay?
Please. Take it off.

46:35.810 --> 46:39.240
Take it off.
I've had enough.

46:39.240 --> 46:41.340
Take it off.
I feel stupid now.

46:41.340 --> 46:45.280
You make me
feel so stupid. Fuck.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.050
Untie me.

46:47.050 --> 46:49.490
Take it off. Okay, come on.
I've had enough. Please.

46:50.620 --> 46:53.260
Gina, baby, please!

47:05.470 --> 47:10.370
<i>Atención, señores pasajeros
de tren 187 con destino a Paris...</i>

47:20.520 --> 47:21.750
Geen!
Geen, Geen!

47:21.750 --> 47:23.480
Geen! Geen!

47:28.390 --> 47:31.330
Let me see you.
You've grown.

47:31.330 --> 47:32.860
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

47:34.630 --> 47:37.700
- Hey.
- How are you?

47:37.700 --> 47:39.370
- Look at him.
- I know!

47:39.370 --> 47:41.270
- Hey, man. How are you?
- Fine.

47:41.270 --> 47:42.810
Good to see you, Ramon.

47:43.540 --> 47:44.680
Oh!

47:52.380 --> 47:55.250
- Cutest baby you've ever seen?
- Oh, my God. Oh!

47:57.550 --> 48:00.820
Okay. Whoa!
No way. Look at that.

48:00.820 --> 48:02.760
You taught me well!
Look at my tortilla!

48:02.760 --> 48:04.630
She looks just like Luca.

48:04.630 --> 48:08.330
You think so?
Luca, do we look alike?

48:08.330 --> 48:10.400
Hang on.
I think you're right.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.200
Carla, you can't say that.

48:12.200 --> 48:13.900
I gave birth to him. I
can say whatever I want.

48:13.900 --> 48:18.140
When he's bad, he's my boy. When
he's an angel, he's your sister's.

48:18.140 --> 48:19.840
- Stole my entire youth.
- Yeah?

48:19.840 --> 48:23.750
Let's eat.
I'm fat, ugly, I don't sleep.

48:24.710 --> 48:26.480
- Hey.
- Luca!

48:26.480 --> 48:28.580
What about you two?
<i>¿Niños?</i>

48:28.590 --> 48:30.820
- What about us?
- Soon. Hopefully.

48:30.820 --> 48:32.420
- Soon?
- Real soon, yeah.

48:32.420 --> 48:33.920
- Practice makes perfect.
- Yeah.

48:33.920 --> 48:36.190
- Indeed it does. Hear, hear.
- You know?

48:36.190 --> 48:37.730
Zambomba,
pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

48:37.730 --> 48:39.730
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa.

48:39.730 --> 48:42.230
You know how to get
her pregnant, James?

48:42.230 --> 48:44.400
- How?
- Stop putting it in her ass.

48:44.400 --> 48:45.770
I mean it.
What?

48:45.770 --> 48:48.240
- You can't...
- I'm sorry.

48:48.240 --> 48:50.240
- I can't believe you said that.
- I'm sorry.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.340
- We don't do that, Ramon.
- You don't... Oh, come on.

48:52.340 --> 48:54.340
You should. It's great.
Ask Carla.

48:59.180 --> 49:01.350
Oh, my God.

49:01.350 --> 49:04.690
- Does it worry you, James?
- What?

49:04.690 --> 49:07.290
Mmm. I don't know.

49:07.290 --> 49:10.760
Now that Gina can see, she might find
someone better-looking than you.

49:10.760 --> 49:12.530
This is gonna
be a long night.

49:21.770 --> 49:23.610
Okay. Be good.

49:47.860 --> 49:50.000
You still wanna go
to the tunnel tomorrow, right?

49:50.000 --> 49:53.340
Yes. You keep asking.
Why you keep asking me?

49:53.340 --> 49:55.840
- I want to make sure you want to go.
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

50:02.750 --> 50:06.550
- You think about it a lot?
- I think about it every day.

50:06.550 --> 50:08.820
I know.
I think about it too.

50:08.820 --> 50:12.590
It's just... just go and get
it over with, you know?

50:12.590 --> 50:13.690
Yeah.

50:26.340 --> 50:28.770
Oh, my God. I don't
know how to do it.

50:28.770 --> 50:30.040
It's perfect.

50:34.410 --> 50:35.410
What?

50:44.590 --> 50:46.690
No. She doesn't want
to wear that dress.

50:46.690 --> 50:50.760
It's a dress... I don't know,
like a little mermaid.

50:50.760 --> 50:51.800
You like it?

50:55.530 --> 50:56.730
Please?

50:59.470 --> 51:00.670
- Please?
- Now!

51:00.670 --> 51:03.770
I'm a little mermaid
with my mustache.

51:03.770 --> 51:06.640
Glub, glub, glub,
glub, glub.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.940
Glub, glub,
glub, glub, glub.

51:08.940 --> 51:12.050
- Just watch me, please.
- No one's watching you.

51:12.050 --> 51:16.980
Because if you not watch
me, I can't leave.

51:16.990 --> 51:19.590
Could you please get in
the shower so we can go.

51:19.590 --> 51:23.420
- I don't want to be waiting for you.
- Just one last dance.

51:23.430 --> 51:27.630
<i>♪ So I'm going
To the shower ♪</i>

51:27.630 --> 51:29.330
<i>Adios. Gracias.</i>

51:29.330 --> 51:30.500
<i>Adios, mi amor.</i>

51:46.450 --> 51:48.050
We ready?

51:49.120 --> 51:50.350
Wow.

51:52.020 --> 51:54.490
Where'd you get changed?

51:54.490 --> 51:57.690
- In Carla and Ramon's room.
- He's not in there, is he?

51:57.690 --> 52:01.330
I'm wearing makeup.
I'm wearing makeup!

52:02.830 --> 52:06.070
You look hot. You look really...
Oh, my God, you look hot.

52:06.840 --> 52:08.600
Sexy. Very sexy.

52:08.610 --> 52:11.110
What? You're saying it
like it's a bad thing.

52:11.110 --> 52:14.810
No, it's not a bad thing. I've never seen
my wife in a dress like that before.

52:15.950 --> 52:17.450
I guess
it's not really you, huh?

52:17.450 --> 52:20.157
We don't really
know what me is.

52:20.169 --> 52:23.820
Oh. I guess we don't
really know who you is.

52:26.760 --> 52:29.820
- You wearing any underwear?
- Of course.

52:40.940 --> 52:43.570
<i>Señor! Señor!</i>

52:44.940 --> 52:45.940
<i>Cigarro!</i>

52:48.150 --> 52:50.780
Hey, what are you doing?

52:50.780 --> 52:53.550
Hey, so I heard
you work in insurance.

52:53.550 --> 52:54.780
Yeah,
I work in insurance.

52:54.790 --> 52:58.190
That's why we're in Thailand.
I got a promotion.

52:58.190 --> 53:01.860
- Is it as boring as it sounds?
- Yes, it is. Fuck you very much.

53:35.560 --> 53:37.860
Hey, hey, hey. We should
go see a show, huh?

53:37.860 --> 53:40.030
What? No. They don't
want to go see a show.

53:40.030 --> 53:41.800
- Come on. Why not?
- I don't know.

53:49.710 --> 53:51.170
- James!
- James!

53:51.170 --> 53:52.910
- What?
- What?

53:52.910 --> 53:55.110
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. You don't wanna go?

53:55.110 --> 53:57.180
Peep show!
Barca!

53:57.180 --> 53:59.010
- You guys go.
- Are you being serious?

53:59.020 --> 54:02.180
- No, you're coming.
- No. Take her in.

54:02.190 --> 54:04.120
- I'll be right here.
- You're not gonna come?

54:04.120 --> 54:07.090
- No. Go and have a good time.
- I don't want him to come.

54:07.090 --> 54:08.830
Good-bye, James.

55:14.920 --> 55:17.530
Yes!

55:20.630 --> 55:23.000
- You missed out.
- What? What?

55:23.000 --> 55:24.230
Crazy, man.

55:24.230 --> 55:28.070
That was unbelievable.

55:29.770 --> 55:31.570
Why aren't you laughing?

55:31.570 --> 55:33.140
I'm just kind of...
Yeah.

55:33.140 --> 55:35.880
A pussy!
Pussy!

55:35.880 --> 55:36.937
Teach him how...

55:36.949 --> 55:39.680
He doesn't know how
to do that to a woman.

55:39.680 --> 55:41.850
- He likes to be very proper.
- I can't hear you.

55:41.850 --> 55:44.050
Oh, hi.

55:44.050 --> 55:47.050
You know when you said earlier,
now that my wife can see,

55:47.060 --> 55:50.020
am I worried that she's gonna
run off with another man?

55:50.030 --> 55:51.760
No, don't listen to me.

55:51.760 --> 55:54.900
- No... W-Well, you said it.
- I was joking with you.

55:54.900 --> 55:56.030
Hey. Hey!

55:59.040 --> 56:01.030
This guy
just grabbed my ass!

56:01.040 --> 56:04.010
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Gina, Gina, Gina.

56:04.010 --> 56:06.010
- What do you think you're doing?
- What's going on?

56:06.010 --> 56:08.130
This fucking guy grabbed my ass!
What is your problem?

56:09.980 --> 56:12.010
- Calm down.
- No, you... you calm...

56:12.020 --> 56:14.720
What, 'cause he didn't
grab your fucking ass?

56:14.720 --> 56:18.050
- You okay? You okay?
- Thank you, Ramon. Thank you.

56:18.050 --> 56:20.960
- Gina, what's going on?
- What do you mean? I told you. It's fine.

56:20.960 --> 56:22.390
Ramon
took care of it.

56:22.390 --> 56:24.990
Anyone else want to grab my ass?
He's fine with it.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.700
- Hey, you! You wanna grab my ass?
- Gina, stop it! Stop it!

56:29.800 --> 56:31.830
Is there any need to humiliate
me in front of your sister?

56:31.840 --> 56:33.400
- I humiliated... It's my fault?
- Yeah.

56:35.870 --> 56:38.210
<i>Dimelo otra vez.</i>

56:40.310 --> 56:42.210
Say it again.
Say it to my face.

56:44.150 --> 56:46.320
Can you hit me?

56:50.320 --> 56:53.820
Come on, <i>mamacita,</i> I'm gonna fuck you.

56:56.830 --> 56:59.230
Okay, you keep the blankets
for yourself.

58:53.840 --> 58:55.210
Ready?

59:17.130 --> 59:18.230
- Okay?
- Yeah.

59:27.010 --> 59:28.110
Hey, Luca!

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.290
Seemed a lot bigger
when we were little girls.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.290
Hey, hey.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.100
Get back!

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.340
<i>Muere.</i>

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:59.630
- Come on. Join us.
- What'd he say?

01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:01.500
He says, "Come in."

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:04.270
No, no, no.
<i>Muchas gracias,</i> Luca. No.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.304
What'd he say?

01:02:07.316 --> 01:02:09.300
He said his mommy and
daddy bathe together.

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:11.070
Yeah, I bet they do.

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:14.110
- What's wrong?
- You don't think it's a little weird?

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:16.280
- Hey! Hey!
- What? What?

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.710
Having a bath
with Luca.

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:21.180
I think it's fucking weird
you even saying that. Eew.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.020
Hey. Hey.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.260
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.330
We leave for the airport
in an hour.

01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:14.300
I think we should find
somewhere else to live.

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.070
Why? What?

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:20.440
But I'm happy here.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.180
I mean, I... I like it here.
I don't want to move.

01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:25.110
I mean, it's home.

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:37.820
- Do you need a hand?
- Uh-uh. I got it. Thank you.

01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:40.300
- Yeah? You sure?
- Hold on. Please? Just wait.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.300
Want something else?

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.130
Hmm? Hmm?

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:48.140
- Come on.
- You should take a shower.

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:52.380
That's it?

01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.580
<i>Let me get my hands on you.
Why don't you untie me?</i>

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:33.110
<i>What's the point of wearing something
like that if I can't see you?</i>

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.780
<i>- Use your imagination.
- Oh, God. Fuck.</i>

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:38.190
<i>What do you think
about when you jerk off?</i>

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:40.390
<i>I think about you.</i>

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:41.690
<i>- Always?
- Alway...</i>

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.700
<i>What do you think about?</i>

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:53.700
<i>- I think about you.
- Just me? What else?</i>

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:56.600
<i>- Just men.
- Really?</i>

01:04:56.610 --> 01:05:00.210
<i>- Yeah, just bodies and dicks.
- And dicks.</i>

01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:02.880
<i>- So you don't think about me?
- Oh, come on.</i>

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.710
<i>So you do think
about other people.</i>

01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:06.780
<i>Are you
trying to trick me?</i>

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.643
<i>No, I'm not trying to trick you.
I'm not.</i>

01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:09.280
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:12.620
<i>Don't turn this around. I feel
stupid enough as it is. Okay?</i>

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.560
<i>Take it off.</i>

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:02.740
Obviously, a low sperm
count decreases the odds

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:05.610
that one of your sperm will
fertilize your partner's egg.

01:06:05.610 --> 01:06:08.280
Yeah.

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.620
James, I'm afraid it's unlikely
you'll be able to father a child.

01:06:16.420 --> 01:06:18.690
Wow.

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.720
You and your partner
could consider

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:26.930
using either a sperm donor
or maybe even adoption.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:56.690
Oh, boy.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:01.460
That's disgusting!

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.270
Lucky, heel!

01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:09.570
How you doing, Gina? Oh, it's,
uh, Daniel, from the pool.

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:11.370
Yeah, I recognized
your voice.

01:07:11.370 --> 01:07:13.570
- How you doing?
- I'm good. Thank you.

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:16.880
Interesting choice,
the pink handkerchief.

01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:21.720
- Wait a minute. Can you see me?
- Yeah.

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:24.620
No, I had surgery,
so...

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.890
- Wow! That is fantastic!
- Yeah.

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:29.820
What is that like, being able
to see all of the sudden?

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.390
Um... it's... it's...
I mean, it's incredible.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:35.030
Wow, that amaz...
That's good for you.

01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:36.760
Thanks.

01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:38.830
Would you like to
get coffee right now?

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:41.370
Oh, I... I, um...

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.040
- I can't. Sorry.
- That's okay. All right.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:45.512
Well, I'll see you around.

01:07:45.524 --> 01:07:48.440
Yes, I'm sure I'll see you
at the pool or the park.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.710
- Nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:52.550
Lucky!
Come here, boy!

01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:02.590
Come on. Come on.

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:04.490
Good girl.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.400
- What are you making?
- Your favorite... tom kha gai.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.430
- Are you ready for a surprise?
- I hope so.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.540
Wait! Don't look yet.
Close your eyes.

01:08:22.109 --> 01:08:23.910
Open your eyes.

01:08:26.779 --> 01:08:27.920
Wow.

01:08:29.819 --> 01:08:31.420
You're blonde.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.689
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:36.060
- You don't like it?
- No, it's good. It's just different.

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:38.960
I'm just, you know,
not used to it.

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.700
- Is that a bad thing?
- No, it's...

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.130
- It's different.
- Just different?

01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:48.810
I'm just, um, you know...
just a bit shocked, that's all.

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:51.510
Okay.

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:54.410
- What's this?
- The place I'm looking at tomorrow.

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.439
What about me?
I'm working.

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:00.620
Well, if I like it,
we can go back.

01:09:01.979 --> 01:09:03.689
Ah.

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:06.689
All right, miss.

01:09:06.689 --> 01:09:09.420
Tell me some things
you saw today.

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.490
Um... I saw a rainbow
in a puddle.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.496
That's nice.

01:09:14.508 --> 01:09:17.529
It was the first time I saw
it since I was a little girl.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:19.000
Here.
Let me do that.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.069
I went to the dog park
with Ginger,

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:24.069
and there was this really
butch-looking shepherd,

01:09:24.069 --> 01:09:26.970
uh, but he was wearing
this pink handkerchief

01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:30.410
and Ginger
decided to lick his balls.

01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:32.510
- Licked his balls?
- Yes.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.819
- What did the other owner say?
- Um...

01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:39.390
she didn't say
anything.

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:42.830
I guess she has
a sense of humor.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:10.050
You haven't forgotten that work event
we've got coming up next week.

01:10:10.050 --> 01:10:12.220
Mm-mmm.
Got it in my calendar.

01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:15.890
Oh, Miss Organized. You got
yourself a calendar, huh?

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:17.860
What do you expect?

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.460
It'd be good, though, if you might
wear something a little less...

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:22.530
Less what?

01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:25.830
Just something a little more, you know...
It's a work event.

01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:28.100
- Baby, it's all for you.
- I know.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:32.240
I just don't want the whole department
going, "Hey, check out James's wife."

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.790
Did you love me more
before?

01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:55.530
- When you were blind?
- Uh-huh.

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.840
I could ask you
the same thing.

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.540
No, I asked you.

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:07.810
Why blonde?

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:28.120
So,
what do you think?

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.960
Oh, I think
it's amazing.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.860
- I just have to bring my husband back.
- By all means.

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:34.130
It's a great house
for a family.

01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:35.760

01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:13.200
- Hi, James.
- You guys rehearsing?

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.240
- You sound like you're doing really well.
- Guess what?

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.400
- What? What happened to your eye?
- Nothing.

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:19.970
<i>♪ It makes me happy ♪</i>

01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:20.910
What happened to your eye?

01:13:20.922 --> 01:13:22.840
It's just sore. I'm gonna go see Dr.
Hughes tomorrow.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.810
- Gina!
- It doesn't look very good... What?

01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:27.210
- Come here!
- Guess what.

01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:29.720
- What?
- I found our house.

01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:32.090
- What do you mean?
- I mean I found our house.

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:34.960
- I thought we spoke about this.
- Yes, we did, but...

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.090
- What is it? Jesus.
- Look at it.

01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:41.360
Gina, don't. I'm gonna
get a garbage bag.

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.230
It's fine.
I'm gonna freeze it.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:48.240
Carla and I
used to save their feathers.

01:13:54.980 --> 01:13:57.250
Okay,
you can relax now.

01:13:58.410 --> 01:14:01.680
There seems to be
a low-grade rejection.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.220
What does that mean?

01:14:03.220 --> 01:14:05.850
There's no infection,
so it should be fine.

01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:08.120
But I'm gonna prescribe you
a higher dosage of steroids.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.960
But rejection, I don't...
I don't like that.

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.860
Don't worry. It's just
a slight inflammation.

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:51.170
Baby, it's your sister.
She's on the phone.

01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:55.300
<i>He said there's
nothing we can do.</i>

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.800
<i>We just have to wait.
And I keep taking my drops.</i>

01:14:57.810 --> 01:15:00.970
I just don't think you should keep relying
on these drops if you're getting worse.

01:15:00.980 --> 01:15:03.180
Maybe my eye is rejecting
the transplant.

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:07.080
That happens. I could
be one of those people.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:11.120
Listen, I don't know
what else to do.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:14.190
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just...
I'm... I'm worried, you know.

01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:15.890
I know. I know.

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:18.960
- Will you call me later?
- Okay.

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.160
Yeah.
I love you.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.260
I love you too.

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:24.830
Okay. Bye.

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:49.520
<i>What do you think about?</i>

01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:52.490
<i>- I think about you.
- What else?</i>

01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:55.130
<i>- Just men.
- Really?</i>

01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:57.960
<i>Yeah.
Just bodies and dicks.</i>

01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:00.270
<i>Dicks, huh? So you
don't think about me?</i>

01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:02.140
<i>- Oh, come on.
- So you do...</i>

01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:23.320
I know full well the operation was
a success. I was there. I did it.

01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:27.860
All right, so... so what? My eye
is rejecting the transplant?

01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:29.860
Are you taking
the correct dosage?

01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:32.270
- Everything you told me to take before.
- Okay.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.310
- Maybe it <i>is</i> the drops.
- No, I-I doubt that.

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:40.010
Okay.

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:44.280
Do you want to check?

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:48.080
I'll send them down to
pharmacology, if you wish.

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:48.596
Okay.

01:16:48.608 --> 01:16:50.190
I'll give you some
samples in the meantime.

01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:54.260
Use them until we figure
out what's going on.

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.200
Oh, come on, Gina.
Fuck.

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:16.410
Baby, what are you doing?

01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:18.558
Come on! I'm sitting
down in the taxi, waiting.

01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:19.650
Just give me a second.

01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:22.050
Come on, honey.
What's the problem? Huh?

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.150
Forget what I said.
Put on whatever you want.

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:29.290
- Give me a fucking minute!
- I gave you a fucking minute.

01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:31.420
- Please, just leave me alone!
- Just get dressed.

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:33.300
I can't fucking see!

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.230
Oh, my love.

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:45.210
Stop.

01:17:45.210 --> 01:17:47.270
I'm sorry.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.540
Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:52.350
Please forgive me, baby.
I'm sorry.

01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:55.020
I'm sorry.
Forgive me. Come on.

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.050
Come on. We're not
gonna go out, okay?

01:17:57.050 --> 01:18:00.090
All right? We're not gonna go out.
We're gonna stay right here.

01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:00.728
I want to go.

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:02.690
No, we're not going out.
No, no, no. Okay?

01:18:02.690 --> 01:18:04.930
No, no.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.500
Come here. Come here.

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.700
My beautiful girl.
Come on.

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.600
Come on. Come on.

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:18.600
Come on.

01:18:18.610 --> 01:18:20.910
Yeah, that's it.

01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:27.110
- I can't...
- We've dealt with this before.

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:29.090
And we were happy then.

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:45.500
Come on. It's okay, honey.
Don't do this. You're okay.

01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.000
You're okay.

01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:53.210
Gina!

01:18:56.610 --> 01:18:57.603
Something wrong?

01:18:57.615 --> 01:19:00.350
I don't know. I think
she's just overheating.

01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:03.420
- Come here, girl.
- Just trying to cool her down.

01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:05.750
She's okay.
It happens. She's old.

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:07.290
What's wrong
with your eye?

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.260
Oh, um...

01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:11.760
I don't...
I don't know.

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.530
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:13.530 --> 01:19:15.430
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:18.300
I'm just feeling a little
stressed right now.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.670
She's my baby, you know.

01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:23.170
Why don't we do this? My
apartment's only a block away.

01:19:23.170 --> 01:19:26.710
Why don't we take her there, we'll get
her cooled down and get her some water.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.640
- Yeah?
- Okay. Thank you.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:31.580
- Here. I'll carry her.
- Let me take him.

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.620
- All right.
- Thank you.

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:49.200
- <i>How's she looking?</i>
- So much better. Thank you.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.321
Yeah.

01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:53.530
Gotta be careful with
these dogs in this heat.

01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:56.340
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.370
- She's a sweet girl.
- Yeah. I worry about her.

01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:01.370
God.
She's old now.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:03.140
- How old is she?
- She's 11.

01:20:03.150 --> 01:20:05.140
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:06.750
New for me though.

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.320
I think
she's good to go.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.050
Yeah.
Yeah, she's good.

01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.390
You just move in?

01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:18.360
Uh, no, actually,
I'm moving out.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.090
- I'm going home in a couple of weeks.
- Nice.

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:23.500
If we don't see you,
thanks.

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:06.170
So,
what do you think?

01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:09.540
I think my wife has got very good taste.

01:21:12.250 --> 01:21:15.350
- I'd like to put in an offer.
- Fantastic.

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:09.700
Is that you?

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:11.500
Yeah.

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:13.610
Where have you been?

01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:17.480
I was worried about you finding
your way home in the dark.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.750
I'm sorry. I was at the park with Ginger.
She got sick.

01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:25.250
- You gonna come in here?
- Yeah.

01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:42.800
What's going on with Ginger?
Is she okay?

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:46.510
Yeah. She just overheats.
She's okay now though.

01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:49.740
You might want to spend a little
less time worried about the dog

01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:52.820
and a little more time
thinking about yourself.

01:22:59.750 --> 01:23:01.690
I got some news.

01:23:01.690 --> 01:23:04.420
What?

01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:09.660
Your husband put an offer in on that
house that you love down by the river,

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:12.800
and that offer
was accepted.

01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:17.370
- What?
- Yeah.

01:23:17.370 --> 01:23:18.540
It's ours.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.680
- Oh, my...
- Yeah.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:30.420
You know, thought it might
be a nice surprise.

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:33.560
That's amazing.

The results came back
and you're right.

01:23:58.310 --> 01:24:03.280

Yeah, thank you.

01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:38.750
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, Gina.

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:39.890
This your apartment?

01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:41.890
Yes.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:55.040
- When were you last here, ma'am?
- A couple hours ago.

01:24:57.110 --> 01:24:58.231
<i>Hey.</i>

01:24:58.243 --> 01:25:01.640
James, I'm at our apartment.
We've been broken into.

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:05.350
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- I'm with the police.

01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:08.010
<i>All right, look, I'm gonna
come home straightaway. Okay?</i>

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:09.610
<i>All right? Gina?</i>

01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:11.080
Ginger?

01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:13.050
Ginger, come on, baby.

01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:16.620
- Come on. Where... Have you seen my dog?
- We didn't see any dog.

01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.530
There's a bell.
You'll hear her.

01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:22.560
Ginger!

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:29.100
Come on, baby.

01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:30.810
Come to Mama.

01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:34.540
Come on, baby.
Come on.

01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:38.610
Ginger, come on!

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:41.550
- Ginger, come on, baby!
- Gina!

01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:45.050
Gina.
Come on.

01:25:45.050 --> 01:25:49.060
Uh, Gina, this is Daniel.
Daniel, this is my wife, Gina.

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.520
Hey, Gina.
How are you?

01:25:50.530 --> 01:25:52.060
- Yeah.
- How are you?

01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:55.060
Daniel walks his dog in the park.
Doesn't he, boy?

01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:58.500
Every day. He said he's gonna
give us a call if he sees Ginger.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.000
- Okay.
- Gave him my telephone number.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.730
- Yeah.
- Can you help me find her?

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.970
- Mm-hmm.
- It was nice meeting you.

01:26:03.970 --> 01:26:05.840
- James.
- Pleasure.

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.670
Pleasure to meet you. And I got
your number, so if I see her...

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.580
- Please do.
- See you guys later.

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.552
I'm not lying to you.
Please leave me alone.

01:26:15.564 --> 01:26:16.620
You're humiliating me.

01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:18.201
That was the exact
same dog that you

01:26:18.213 --> 01:26:20.150
described to me with a
pink fuckin' bandana.

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:23.660
You think I believe you're out with Richard
every night when you come home plastered?

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:26.530
Why do you pretend
you don't know each other?

01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:29.530
I might be stupid, but I'm not blind.
I could see you knew him.

01:26:29.530 --> 01:26:30.535
Why are you lying to me?

01:26:30.547 --> 01:26:33.050
Because I'm attracted to him.
Is that what you want to hear?

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:43.610
Gina.

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:46.880
- Hey.
- How are you?

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:52.620
Did you guys
find Ginger?

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:53.890
No.

01:26:58.460 --> 01:27:00.160
I-I tried to call you.

01:27:01.730 --> 01:27:03.030
I'm sorry.

01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:21.210
James? It's you?

01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.950
Uh, yes, it is.

01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:25.920
Just gonna get a drink.

01:27:34.230 --> 01:27:36.860
What the fuck.

01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:47.170
Hey, baby, come here.

01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:02.890
I have something
to tell you.

01:28:02.890 --> 01:28:04.130
Mmm?

01:28:06.690 --> 01:28:08.100
I'm pregnant.

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.210
<i>Hello.</i>

01:28:59.210 --> 01:29:01.250
<i>No one is available
to take your call.</i>

01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:04.220
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:06.650
Hey, Daniel,
it's, uh... it's Gina.

01:29:06.650 --> 01:29:10.960
I'm not sure when you leave. I
just wanted to, um... to see...

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.120
Hello?

01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:27.970
Are you upstairs?

01:30:27.970 --> 01:30:29.800
Gina!

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:31.740
Yeah.
I'm in the baby's room.

01:30:31.740 --> 01:30:34.670
I'm gonna head out for a...
Oh! Oh-ho. Hey.

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:36.710
Hang on.
Let me give you a hand.

01:30:36.710 --> 01:30:38.910
- Hang on.
- No, I got it.

01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:41.450
- Yeah, you got it.
- I told you, James, I have it.

01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:43.720
Watch out.

01:30:56.730 --> 01:30:59.400
I'm going to head over
the apartment,

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.400
finish picking up the rest of the
boxes, see what else needs doing.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.710
I'll see you
at the concert.

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:10.010
- I thought I was gonna drive you.
- No, Jill's picking me up.

01:31:10.010 --> 01:31:11.940
Oh, Jill's picking you up,
is she?

01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:14.950
- Yeah. Lucy and I have to be there early.
- Okay.

01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:17.950
- Make sure she drives nice and safe, okay?
- Okay.

01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.690
All right.
