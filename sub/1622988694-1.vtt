WEBVTT

00:00.417 --> 00:03.503
(film rolling sound)

00:07.841 --> 00:13.888
(dramatic flute music)

00:17.016 --> 00:19.686
(ominous music)

00:26.985 --> 00:28.987
(ominous music)

00:43.209 --> 00:47.255
- [Simon] Never in my wildest dreams

00:47.255 --> 00:51.968
did I think when I told Gary
something bad is gonna happen,

00:54.304 --> 00:56.514
did I think it was gonna be this.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.102
- [Gal] I can't imagine

01:01.102 --> 01:03.730
what Gary must have been going through

01:03.730 --> 01:05.231
and how he must have felt

01:05.231 --> 01:08.902
being so alone and so far out there.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.075
- [Beverly] He said
that the longer he stood

01:15.075 --> 01:16.242
and looked at it,

01:18.203 --> 01:22.457
the more spooked that he
got the feeling of dread,

01:22.457 --> 01:25.919
the sixth sense that he
needed to get out of there.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.755
(thunder roaring)

02:09.629 --> 02:11.131
(thunder roars)

02:19.347 --> 02:22.183
(thunder roaring)

02:23.768 --> 02:25.770
(dramatic music)

02:55.633 --> 02:56.968
- I first knew something was wrong

02:56.968 --> 03:00.138
when I was on the phone with my publisher,

03:00.138 --> 03:03.057
and Simon kept trying to call in.

03:03.057 --> 03:06.352
And so once I was off the
phone with my publisher,

03:06.352 --> 03:10.064
I called Simon who's Gary's roommate.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.902
And he told me that
Gary was two days late.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.738
That's not Gary,

03:16.738 --> 03:17.906
you know, Gary,

03:18.907 --> 03:21.326
would never leave Tuca that long,

03:21.326 --> 03:24.412
especially knowing that
Simon had to go out of town.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.414
That's when I knew that
there was something wrong,

03:26.414 --> 03:27.540
and I needed to get there.

03:27.540 --> 03:32.378
So I packed up and left Panaca
and headed straight to Ruth.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.631
I needed to see what was going on

03:34.631 --> 03:37.008
and make sure that my brother was okay.

03:37.008 --> 03:39.469
And to take care of Tuca
until he could get back.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.182
I really thought he would be back.

03:45.600 --> 03:50.104
- I first met Gary when
they were having an event

03:50.104 --> 03:52.440
at the Nevada Northern Railway.

03:52.440 --> 03:57.403
And we both just kind of,
wandered in each other's paths,

03:57.403 --> 03:59.948
and started talking about trains,

03:59.948 --> 04:04.786
and, we were both looking
for a place to stay.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.329
I was trying to find a place for work,

04:06.329 --> 04:08.331
he was in between places,

04:08.331 --> 04:12.210
and we kind of just
happened upon this place.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.423
- The first time I heard
the name, Gary Hinge,

04:17.423 --> 04:22.262
I believe was when I was working
for the radio station NNN,

04:22.262 --> 04:23.388
It was um..

04:23.388 --> 04:24.931
I was an investigative reporter,

04:24.931 --> 04:26.766
it was my first job right out of the gate,

04:26.766 --> 04:28.851
and my producer came
to me and he was like,

04:28.851 --> 04:30.436
we have to cover this,

04:30.436 --> 04:32.689
I think it's a good
idea for us to do this,

04:32.689 --> 04:35.608
because the TV stations, the news,

04:35.608 --> 04:36.943
had stopped recording on it.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.278
And so this was a way
for us to get exclusives

04:39.278 --> 04:40.488
and to keep the story going.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.616
Because according to everyone
else that was hearing about it

04:43.616 --> 04:47.412
and reporting about it,
it had just gone cold.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.123
- If you want me to
describe my brother Gary,

04:50.123 --> 04:54.502
the best way to describe him is,

04:55.628 --> 04:57.422
if there was a little lady that said,

04:57.422 --> 04:59.465
can you please watch my purse,

05:00.550 --> 05:02.677
no matter where they were at,

05:02.677 --> 05:06.764
Gary would sit there and
he would watch her purse

05:06.764 --> 05:10.101
and make sure that it was
safe until she came back.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.395
That was just the type
of person that he was,

05:12.395 --> 05:17.400
he was trustworthy and amazing.

05:18.943 --> 05:19.819
Amazing.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.239
- So Gary loved the outdoors,

05:23.239 --> 05:26.951
I mean, he was the king of outdoors.

05:26.951 --> 05:27.994
Let's just say that.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.372
And I think a lot of people
were really envious of him.

05:31.372 --> 05:34.250
Like he lived this
beautiful adventurous life,

05:34.250 --> 05:39.005
that I think, those who
have the nine to five job,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.214
stuck behind a desk,

05:40.214 --> 05:44.052
I think, really admired that about him.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.765
- Super smart, but definitely private,

05:48.765 --> 05:51.184
he kind of just kept to himself.

05:51.184 --> 05:56.189
If he wasn't in his room on his computer,

05:56.522 --> 05:59.317
then he was working on his model railroad.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.362
But other than that,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.989
yeah, just really kept
to himself in his room

06:04.989 --> 06:06.199
making his videos.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.952
Super funny, though (chuckles slightly)

06:09.952 --> 06:11.871
definitely could make you laugh

06:11.871 --> 06:13.873
with a couple of his one liners.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.043
(uplifting music)

06:17.502 --> 06:21.047
- I started to learn
more about who Gary was.

06:21.047 --> 06:21.881
And I found out

06:21.881 --> 06:25.134
that he was an extremely
highly intelligent man.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.513
He's one of those people that was so smart

06:28.513 --> 06:32.391
that kind of had a hard time
connecting with other people.

06:33.351 --> 06:37.522
So he mostly just kind
of was more, solitude,

06:37.522 --> 06:41.776
and yeah, fascinating.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.152
The more I found out about him,

06:43.152 --> 06:48.157
the more I wanted to keep
finding out about, who is Gary?

06:50.326 --> 06:52.328
(uplifting music)

07:03.297 --> 07:05.007
Gary had found his dream job,

07:05.007 --> 07:07.301
being such an avid outdoors man,

07:07.301 --> 07:11.806
he started to work for a startup
company called Map Nevada.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.808
Now what they do is,

07:13.808 --> 07:17.895
they map out really remote
locations for hunters.

07:17.895 --> 07:22.900
So they track wildlife, weather, terrain,

07:23.025 --> 07:26.863
and I mean, Gary was in heaven doing this.

07:26.863 --> 07:31.868
- He loved to be by himself
out in the wilderness,

07:34.620 --> 07:36.539
he loved hiking,

07:36.539 --> 07:40.334
and being adventurous,

07:41.419 --> 07:46.424
any train, he was drawn
to, he loved trains.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.595
(ballast clattering)

07:50.595 --> 07:54.599
- [Gary] Hey guys filming
another little YouTube video,

07:54.599 --> 07:57.351
at one of my favorite places.

07:57.351 --> 08:01.606
If I had more time I would
become one of the volunteers,

08:01.606 --> 08:06.569
but this is the Nevada Northern
Railway Museum, here in Ely.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.530
And it's kind of an old little copper mine

08:09.530 --> 08:11.824
just preserved and left.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.075
They do some cool stuff, though,

08:13.075 --> 08:17.788
like you can sleep in this
old caboose from Kennecott,

08:17.788 --> 08:20.291
the big copper mine in the area,

08:20.291 --> 08:21.959
right outside my home in Ruth.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.630
It's kind of a neat
little railroad museum,

08:25.630 --> 08:27.673
they just kind of let you walk around.

08:29.717 --> 08:33.179
And you know how much I love
trains on top of hiking,

08:33.179 --> 08:34.639
gotta do something in the winter time

08:34.639 --> 08:37.725
and you can't be outside as much.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.353
- So I was really excited
to take on this story,

08:40.353 --> 08:42.313
seeing that it was my first story.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.814
And it also took place

08:43.814 --> 08:46.234
in this tiny little town called Ruth.

08:46.234 --> 08:49.153
And so I grabbed the phone book,
and I just started calling.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.113
And I wanted to talk to
anybody and everybody

08:51.113 --> 08:52.198
that would talk to me.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.619
- I first knew something was off

08:56.619 --> 08:59.455
when he asked me to watch his dog Tuca

08:59.455 --> 09:02.708
before he went out on one of his trips.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.044
And he never leaves Tuca.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.213
He always takes the dog with him,

09:07.213 --> 09:09.173
so I thought that was kind of weird.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.384
And he was acting super stressed out

09:11.384 --> 09:14.178
even keeping to himself even more.

09:14.178 --> 09:17.974
When he didn't come back after two days,

09:19.517 --> 09:21.686
I thought that was really strange.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.062
I had a flight to catch,

09:23.062 --> 09:26.482
so I just called Beverly to get the dog.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.026
- After I got off the phone with Simon,

09:29.026 --> 09:32.196
I tried Gary, and there was no answer,

09:32.196 --> 09:36.284
so I hurried and left and
I went to Ruth from Panaca.

09:36.284 --> 09:40.329
And it's only a couple hours away,

09:40.329 --> 09:42.206
so when I got there,

09:42.206 --> 09:45.543
Simon and Tuca were
waiting on the front steps.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.212
Simon really needed to get
to the airport in Las Vegas,

09:48.212 --> 09:51.632
so I asked him where Gary had gone to,

09:53.217 --> 09:57.680
and Simon didn't know, his
roommate didn't even know,

09:57.680 --> 10:00.224
he just knew that he was on an expedition.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.559
To me that wasn't right,

10:01.559 --> 10:03.769
so I tried Gary a couple of more times,

10:03.769 --> 10:05.479
and all it did was go to voicemail

10:05.479 --> 10:10.067
and something was definitely wrong.

10:10.067 --> 10:12.820
And so I called the police and waited.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.449
(mysterious music)

10:22.038 --> 10:23.748
- So I got Beverley's phone number,

10:23.748 --> 10:26.667
and this is the only time
that I ever talked to her.

10:26.667 --> 10:30.796
And she was pretty angry with me,

10:30.796 --> 10:32.923
once I told her that I was a reporter.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.469
And she did not want to
have anything to do with me

10:36.469 --> 10:39.347
or our show, which I thought
was really unfortunate,

10:39.347 --> 10:41.766
because, the news stations,

10:41.766 --> 10:43.684
they had stopped recording on this,

10:43.684 --> 10:45.811
and we were the only ones doing anything,

10:45.811 --> 10:48.272
and I thought this is a way
to help find your brother,

10:48.272 --> 10:49.607
I don't understand why

10:49.607 --> 10:51.150
you don't want to give me the time or day,

10:51.150 --> 10:53.569
but she didn't, and she quickly hung up.

10:53.569 --> 10:56.489
And that was the only time
that I spoke to Beverly.

10:57.698 --> 11:01.869
- Gary became so obsessed
with survivalism,

11:01.869 --> 11:04.830
he would watch the Discovery Channel,

11:04.830 --> 11:07.708
he would watch YouTube,

11:07.708 --> 11:12.213
he would study it and find
the most remote places,

11:12.213 --> 11:16.384
no cell service, no provisions of any kind

11:16.384 --> 11:18.511
other than what he took.

11:18.511 --> 11:23.474
And it used to scare
the heavens out of me.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.185
I mean, I was petrified for him,

11:26.185 --> 11:27.895
and I would worry so much.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.189
But after a while,

11:31.816 --> 11:33.025
it was Gary.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.822
- [Gary] So guys, I'm here hiking around,

11:37.822 --> 11:41.117
and this is one of the cool secrets

11:41.117 --> 11:42.827
I have in the wilds in Nevada

11:42.827 --> 11:47.790
is this cemetery from the
late 1800s old mining camp,

11:49.542 --> 11:54.422
but I won't disclose the
name for safety reasons.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.132
Don't want anyone getting lost out here,

11:56.132 --> 12:01.137
but you can see all these
old graves, wood stones,

12:01.887 --> 12:04.974
unmarked graves with no names now.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.352
Give you an idea of
where I had to hike from

12:08.352 --> 12:11.689
is that mountain way over there

12:11.689 --> 12:14.942
is my truck's on the other side of it.

12:14.942 --> 12:17.695
So hiked over that mountain

12:17.695 --> 12:22.658
and I'm way out this
way now, hiking around.

12:22.658 --> 12:27.663
- I wouldn't say what
Gary was doing was hiking.

12:28.289 --> 12:33.252
These were multiple day,
like survival excursions.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.922
- In the beginning, what gave me hope

12:36.922 --> 12:41.927
was the fact that when
Gary was much younger,

12:43.596 --> 12:46.140
much, much younger, like second grade,

12:46.140 --> 12:51.145
we all went camping, and Gary
disappeared from the campsite.

12:52.438 --> 12:56.066
And we searched for him
and searched for him,

12:56.066 --> 12:59.570
and we were all so worried, mom
and dad were just terrified,

12:59.570 --> 13:01.530
I was terrified.

13:01.530 --> 13:02.740
We didn't wanna leave the mountain

13:02.740 --> 13:04.700
to go and get cell service or anything,

13:04.700 --> 13:07.661
we just went looking for him.

13:07.661 --> 13:11.499
And we looked for him all night.

13:11.499 --> 13:16.462
And the next morning we came
up to a sheep herders camp,

13:16.629 --> 13:18.798
thinking, we're gonna tell them look,

13:18.798 --> 13:20.925
keep an eye out for this second grader,

13:20.925 --> 13:25.304
this second grader that was missing

13:25.304 --> 13:30.226
and we walk up and there
is my little brother Gary,

13:31.268 --> 13:33.938
playing with the animals.

13:33.938 --> 13:37.066
He'd known that if he got
to the sheep herders camp,

13:37.066 --> 13:37.900
he would be okay,

13:37.900 --> 13:40.528
that mom and dad would
come and look for him.

13:40.528 --> 13:45.533
And he was so resilient, it
was in him, second nature.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.954
- So after speaking to a
bunch of people in Ruth,

13:49.954 --> 13:53.040
I started to learn a little
bit more about Beverly

13:53.040 --> 13:57.461
and Beverly's relationship
with Gary in the past.

13:57.461 --> 14:01.423
So she had a lot of anger towards Gary.

14:02.591 --> 14:06.637
She really blamed him
for their parents' death.

14:06.637 --> 14:09.348
And then when their parents did pass away,

14:09.348 --> 14:12.059
she was stuck, still raising Gary

14:12.059 --> 14:16.188
and so she held quite a lot
of resentment against him.

14:17.815 --> 14:21.110
- Well, I was mad at
Gary when mom dad died,

14:22.570 --> 14:24.321
they were out on a fishing trip

14:24.321 --> 14:27.449
and mom and dad liked to
do some night fishing.

14:28.325 --> 14:32.288
And so they went out
and did hang the lantern

14:32.288 --> 14:33.205
where they could see it,

14:33.205 --> 14:35.040
so they could get back to shore safely,

14:35.040 --> 14:37.793
back to camp without hitting any rocks.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.795
Old Gary decided

14:39.795 --> 14:42.423
that he was gonna go
hunting frogs and everything

14:42.423 --> 14:45.426
and so, and he went exploring.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.721
And while he's out there
he hung the lantern up,

14:48.721 --> 14:51.265
so that he could see what he was doing.

14:51.265 --> 14:52.474
Meanwhile, mom and dad

14:52.474 --> 14:54.560
decided that they were gonna come back in

14:54.560 --> 14:56.270
and call it a night.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.147
So they headed for the lantern.

14:59.231 --> 15:04.236
Not knowing that Gary had
moved it while he was exploring

15:05.404 --> 15:08.073
and so they followed the light.

15:08.073 --> 15:13.078
And, it was the wrong spot.

15:13.787 --> 15:18.500
They didn't make it back
because they hit the rocks,

15:18.500 --> 15:23.505
and had Gary not hang the
lantern up where he was at

15:24.131 --> 15:26.258
and left it where it needed to be,

15:28.135 --> 15:30.054
there wouldn't have been any problems.

15:33.098 --> 15:38.103
- I just felt super bad for Beverly.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.652
You know, I could just hear her

15:44.652 --> 15:48.030
inside Gary's room, sobbing.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.786
- You know, you're really
making me miss my brother, Gary.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.915
(sentimental music)

16:11.553 --> 16:14.807
- [Gal] Kept hearing people
refer to Gary as a hiker.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.560
And in my opinion, I don't
really think that's correct.

16:18.560 --> 16:22.147
Because, to me, Gary's
more of a survivalist,

16:22.147 --> 16:27.152
he would go out into the
wilderness for a week or two on end

16:27.361 --> 16:29.196
with just a backpack.

16:29.196 --> 16:32.574
He's kind of like the
MacGyver of the wilderness,

16:32.574 --> 16:37.246
just to survive and live off of the land,

16:37.246 --> 16:39.748
and filter his on water.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.042
So, to hear them just be like,

16:42.042 --> 16:44.336
oh, he's just a hiker gone missing.

16:44.336 --> 16:45.462
He's not.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.548
- When Gary and I first
started living together,

16:47.548 --> 16:50.926
I actually went out with
him on one of these things.

16:50.926 --> 16:55.764
And I just kept telling myself
the entire time, never again.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.309
Gary wouldn't let us bring
enough food or water,

16:59.309 --> 17:02.521
and it was the most miserable experience.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.982
The one thing I did like about it

17:04.982 --> 17:08.861
was we kept on finding these 1800's

17:08.861 --> 17:11.697
abandoned mining kind of structures,

17:11.697 --> 17:12.740
which was super cool.

17:14.616 --> 17:18.037
- This wasn't a normal search and rescue.

17:18.037 --> 17:23.041
Because, Gary didn't tell
anybody where he was going

17:23.500 --> 17:25.044
on his excursion.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.838
And he would go really
deep into the wilderness,

17:27.838 --> 17:31.300
and he'd be gone for a week or so,

17:31.300 --> 17:35.929
so no one had any idea
where to even start looking.

17:35.929 --> 17:40.517
And so police decided the best way,

17:40.517 --> 17:41.852
or the only thing they could think of

17:41.852 --> 17:44.938
was to maybe check his cell phone,

17:44.938 --> 17:48.317
and his cell phone pings in which tower.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.612
And it looked to be as he
had turned his cell phone off

17:51.612 --> 17:53.989
shortly after leaving his home.

17:54.948 --> 17:56.950
- When Beverly showed up to get the dog.

17:58.202 --> 18:02.122
Yeah, I regret that now, I
kind of lashed out at her.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.127
- I was so put off when I got to town,

18:07.127 --> 18:11.340
and he was so antsy to get out of there.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.968
And, being my brother's roommate,

18:14.968 --> 18:17.304
not even asking where he was gonna be,

18:17.304 --> 18:19.890
or, if there was gonna,

18:19.890 --> 18:23.143
you know any issue that
might set up a red flag

18:23.143 --> 18:25.479
if he didn't come home.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.396
He had his dog and everything,

18:26.396 --> 18:28.941
and he knew he needed to be out of town.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.070
I just didn't,

18:33.070 --> 18:34.613
I didn't feel right about it,

18:34.613 --> 18:35.823
it just didn't feel right.

18:35.823 --> 18:39.201
And, a week or so before
that, Gary had confided in me

18:39.201 --> 18:42.287
that him and Simon weren't
getting along very well,

18:42.287 --> 18:45.415
and so he wanted to move out.

18:45.415 --> 18:49.753
And so I just,

18:49.753 --> 18:53.632
it just didn't feel right,
so I let the cops know.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.176
You know, I just don't trust him,

18:56.176 --> 19:00.681
there's just something to
not be concerned at all,

19:00.681 --> 19:02.724
where your roommate's gonna be.

19:02.724 --> 19:07.187
And more worried about getting on a plane,

19:07.187 --> 19:11.358
than somebody missing that's
supposed to be your friend,

19:11.358 --> 19:12.526
close to you?

19:13.902 --> 19:14.736
No.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.447
- We never talked about that,

19:17.447 --> 19:19.616
he never told me where
he went hiking, ever,

19:19.616 --> 19:21.160
he never mentioned it.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.120
And even if we did talk about it,

19:23.120 --> 19:27.374
I'm pretty sure he probably
wouldn't have told me, so.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.668
But at the beginning, I understood

19:29.668 --> 19:31.587
she needed someone to point the finger at

19:31.587 --> 19:35.048
and she was super upset, understandably.

19:35.048 --> 19:39.344
But after some time, it
just kind of got old,

19:39.344 --> 19:43.557
so I called her and I now told her that,

19:43.557 --> 19:46.977
there's no way I would have
known and just by the way,

19:46.977 --> 19:49.563
you're his sister, so why didn't you know?

19:50.898 --> 19:53.442
- When I first reported Gary missing,

19:53.442 --> 19:55.485
the police were wonderful,

19:55.485 --> 20:00.115
they were really on top
of it, they did an APB,

20:00.115 --> 20:03.160
be on the lookout for his truck, himself,

20:03.994 --> 20:08.123
Park Rangers, Fish and Game, everything.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.541
You know, we live in a small town,

20:09.541 --> 20:11.627
people don't go missing all the time.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.004
And so this was a big deal,

20:14.004 --> 20:17.341
and they really took it seriously,

20:17.341 --> 20:19.343
they had it everywhere.

20:21.011 --> 20:23.055
I was embarrassed that I didn't know

20:23.055 --> 20:26.642
exactly where he was at,
you know, I'm his sister,

20:28.185 --> 20:29.394
I should have known.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.483
I should have known.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.739
(sentimental music)

20:58.048 --> 21:02.761
- [Simon] My first thought when
I heard he was missing was,

21:04.930 --> 21:08.976
oh, it'd be near impossible to find him.

21:10.852 --> 21:15.440
Either, he finally just injured himself,

21:15.440 --> 21:18.402
or maybe he had eaten something

21:19.820 --> 21:22.489
that he didn't know was
gonna make him so sick.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.204
- It'd been two days since
I'd reported the missing

21:29.204 --> 21:33.417
and I hadn't slept more than
10 to 15 minutes at a time.

21:35.168 --> 21:38.588
I had people calling and were so concerned

21:38.588 --> 21:41.091
and wanted to know where
to start looking for him.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.219
But not knowing where he was at,

21:44.219 --> 21:46.221
where would I have them look?

21:48.181 --> 21:52.352
And then the phone call came,
they'd found Gary's truck.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.522
(ominous music)

22:14.666 --> 22:17.461
(thunder roaring)

22:23.300 --> 22:25.927
And I got such a sinking feeling,

22:25.927 --> 22:28.263
such a sick to my stomach feeling

22:28.263 --> 22:32.642
that this was now very real.

22:32.642 --> 22:35.312
(thunder roars)

22:39.733 --> 22:41.943
After the cops called in,

22:42.819 --> 22:44.154
and let me know that
they'd found this truck,

22:44.154 --> 22:47.115
they came and picked me
up and took me to it.

22:47.115 --> 22:50.535
It was about 55 miles out of town,

22:50.535 --> 22:53.914
and we got there and seeing his truck,

22:55.040 --> 22:58.293
I was so hopeful, you know, thinking,

22:59.753 --> 23:01.963
he probably fell,

23:01.963 --> 23:04.466
maybe broke an ankle, stuck in a ravine,

23:04.466 --> 23:05.717
can't get himself out.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.720
But I had hope.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.225
I really had hope that we
were gonna find him okay.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.561
- It just wasn't in a place
where Gary would have left it.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.564
Like it wasn't in a spot where he wanted,

23:19.564 --> 23:21.733
which he would wanna go to explore.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.737
- While I was sitting there,

23:25.737 --> 23:28.949
watching them process Gary's
truck, I was looking around,

23:31.952 --> 23:34.788
this wasn't Gary,

23:35.705 --> 23:40.710
he loved to explore vast
forests, rocky hills,

23:43.088 --> 23:48.093
beauty, not just a rolling hill of dirt.

23:49.010 --> 23:53.682
It just, something wasn't right.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.434
(gunshot blasts)

24:02.149 --> 24:04.901
(gunshot blasts)

24:06.862 --> 24:09.823
(car engine roaring)

24:09.823 --> 24:11.825
- I'm a private investigator.

24:11.825 --> 24:15.579
I was hired by Beverly shortly
after Gary's truck was found.

24:17.664 --> 24:20.417
The High Desert as you can see,

24:24.629 --> 24:26.548
it's very beautiful,

24:26.548 --> 24:31.553
it's very majestic, has mountains,
valleys, plains, forests,

24:32.304 --> 24:34.055
it has it all.

24:34.055 --> 24:37.559
But it's also quite dangerous
and very unforgiving.

24:37.559 --> 24:40.145
- So after Gary's truck was found,

24:41.480 --> 24:45.317
a search began and people really rallied.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.861
(upbeat music)

24:48.820 --> 24:49.738
- [Bill] Gary went missing

24:49.738 --> 24:52.240
in the hottest part of the summer.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.952
And what we see most of the
time in disappearance like his

24:55.952 --> 25:00.790
is people suffering from heatstroke,

25:00.790 --> 25:04.336
dehydration, sometimes even injury.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.298
- [Beverly] People started showing up

25:08.298 --> 25:11.176
and then more people started showing up,

25:11.176 --> 25:14.262
and next thing I know,
it's a whole whirlwind,

25:14.262 --> 25:18.892
there were people there
that I didn't know,

25:20.352 --> 25:22.020
that Gary didn't know,

25:22.020 --> 25:24.940
there were people bringing drones,

25:24.940 --> 25:26.691
all kinds of search and rescue.

25:26.691 --> 25:30.028
It was the most humbling experience

25:30.028 --> 25:35.033
to know that these strangers
were out there helping

25:35.242 --> 25:39.204
to try to find my brother
and bring him home.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.958
(intense music)

25:52.008 --> 25:55.845
- So once Gary's truck
was found, Beverly was,

25:57.264 --> 25:59.057
let's just say she was very vocal

25:59.057 --> 26:02.560
about how the truck seemed to be parked

26:02.560 --> 26:04.271
in a suspicious location,

26:04.271 --> 26:05.605
like she was just convinced

26:05.605 --> 26:08.191
that her brother had not parked it there,

26:08.191 --> 26:09.985
her brother wouldn't park it there,

26:09.985 --> 26:12.779
and she would not stop talking about it.

26:13.738 --> 26:17.951
So the cops eventually looked into this.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.661
- The clock was ticking.

26:19.661 --> 26:22.956
They very much needed to find
Gary as soon as possible.

26:23.832 --> 26:27.877
Beverly, on the other hand,
was very much in their way.

26:27.877 --> 26:32.882
She was in the way, and she
was really messing things up.

26:33.508 --> 26:36.094
- Searching the high desert isn't easy,

26:36.094 --> 26:37.429
I mean, it's not an easy task.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.346
People think it is,

26:38.346 --> 26:40.932
people think you can just get
up in the air in a helicopter

26:40.932 --> 26:45.937
and fly around and look at
the ground and see someone,

26:46.563 --> 26:51.151
but once you're on the ground,
there's abandoned mines,

26:51.151 --> 26:53.653
there's bushes and tree cover.

26:53.653 --> 26:56.239
And it's super difficult.

26:56.239 --> 27:00.118
So finding someone, it's not
easy as people think it is.

27:01.494 --> 27:03.246
- [Gary] Oh my god, sheep.

27:03.246 --> 27:04.080
(sheep bleating)

27:04.080 --> 27:05.624
Hi sheep.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.708
Look at all the sheep.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.377
Sheep are a lot nicer than people.

27:10.962 --> 27:11.796
(sheep bleating)

27:11.796 --> 27:13.131
(feet rustling)

27:13.131 --> 27:14.090
Hey little sheep,

27:15.675 --> 27:16.718
look at all you guys.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.846
(sheep bleating)

27:19.846 --> 27:23.933
Roaming the land, doing
what you need to do.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.770
(ground rustling)

27:28.605 --> 27:30.690
Jeez, they all ran away from me.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.484
Can't even make friends with sheep.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.904
(sheep bleating)

27:35.904 --> 27:40.200
- The officers didn't want me
to participate in the search.

27:42.994 --> 27:46.915
They thought it was best that
I stay home at Gary's place

27:46.915 --> 27:51.920
in case he tried to contact
me, call or show up.

27:52.879 --> 27:56.174
- I was very much familiar
with the lead investigator.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.967
We had worked together before,

27:57.967 --> 28:00.387
and we were definitely
familiar with each other.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.140
I called him to kind of check up on things

28:04.140 --> 28:08.019
and see where the
investigation was headed,

28:08.019 --> 28:10.772
and if they had any new information.

28:10.772 --> 28:13.733
He told me that they had made
a discovery in the truck.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.236
(ominous music)

28:23.827 --> 28:27.330
But since I was not
formally hired by Beverley,

28:27.330 --> 28:30.041
I had to contact her first

28:30.041 --> 28:32.544
before they would discuss
the matter with me.

28:34.170 --> 28:38.383
- I was hopeful that they had good news,

28:40.343 --> 28:45.348
that the officer asked me
if Gary had any enemies,

28:45.890 --> 28:50.019
or if I knew anybody
that may wanna hurt him.

28:52.605 --> 28:54.649
I asked the officer why,

28:56.192 --> 28:57.152
why would he,

28:58.027 --> 28:59.237
why would he ask that.

28:59.237 --> 29:04.242
And in confidence, they told
me that they had evidence

29:07.829 --> 29:12.709
that Gary did not drive
his truck out there.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.588
(droning music)

29:27.056 --> 29:28.683
- So I waited a couple of hours

29:28.683 --> 29:31.728
and went over to Gary's house
where Beverly was staying,

29:31.728 --> 29:34.606
and she was absolutely hysterical.

29:34.606 --> 29:37.400
She told me that the
police had informed her

29:37.400 --> 29:41.988
that in Gary's truck they
had discovered prints

29:42.864 --> 29:47.869
on top of Gary's all over,
on top of the steering wheel,

29:47.994 --> 29:50.705
the dashboard, the gear

29:50.705 --> 29:55.710
and what was most surprising or alarming

29:56.002 --> 30:01.007
was that they discovered
footprints, bare footprints,

30:01.674 --> 30:06.679
and they were scarred and unidentifiable,

30:07.806 --> 30:10.517
which even added more to the mystery.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.187
(mystery music)

30:18.358 --> 30:19.776
- The footprint was,

30:22.445 --> 30:26.491
he said that it was barefoot.

30:35.166 --> 30:40.088
- So someone drove Gary's truck barefoot.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.133
And it just doesn't sit well with me,

30:44.133 --> 30:46.553
because it's like, what happened?

30:46.553 --> 30:49.138
Why was this person not wearing shoes?

30:50.723 --> 30:51.933
What was going on?

30:51.933 --> 30:54.060
Like, it's just odd,

30:54.060 --> 30:56.396
and it's very,

30:56.396 --> 30:59.190
I don't know, it's just,

31:00.233 --> 31:01.943
it made my skin crawl.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.820
(feet rustling)

31:03.820 --> 31:06.281
- [Gary] Oh, look at the little baby deer.

31:06.281 --> 31:09.158
That's kind of cool to see,
you don't see that too often.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.966
(train engine roaring)

31:30.054 --> 31:33.141
(train hooting)

31:33.141 --> 31:36.394
(train engine roaring)

31:42.817 --> 31:46.362
- You know, I hadn't been
sleeping and everything,

31:46.362 --> 31:49.157
and my mind was just reeling,

31:50.658 --> 31:52.327
I had a lot of things
going through my head,

31:52.327 --> 31:53.745
different scenarios.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.123
Maybe he picked up a friend?

31:58.916 --> 32:02.170
Maybe somebody stole his
truck while he was out hiking?

32:03.129 --> 32:06.633
Or maybe he picked up a hitchhiker,

32:06.633 --> 32:11.638
and the hitchhiker had
done something to him.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.477
I don't know, at this point,

32:17.477 --> 32:20.063
so many things were just
going through my head,

32:20.063 --> 32:24.192
just over and over again,

32:24.192 --> 32:28.780
which didn't help me try to get any sleep.

32:28.780 --> 32:33.785
(train engine roaring)
(train hooting)

32:39.832 --> 32:43.419
- So Beverly, still
wanted me to vet out Simon

32:43.419 --> 32:47.298
because she still thought
he was very suspicious.

32:47.298 --> 32:48.508
And I did too.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.550
I looked into him again,

32:49.550 --> 32:54.138
and lo and behold, he was
ruled out as a suspect.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.225
But through that process,

32:57.225 --> 33:01.062
I actually learned that
Gary had been talking

33:01.062 --> 33:03.898
to someone that he met on
a Facebook Messenger group.

33:05.191 --> 33:07.402
They had been corresponding
with each other

33:07.402 --> 33:09.946
through a local sellers group,

33:09.946 --> 33:13.324
and I guess they had been
commenting on each other's posts

33:13.324 --> 33:14.492
and one thing led to another

33:14.492 --> 33:18.204
and they became more than friends.

33:19.288 --> 33:24.252
When I confronted this person,
he was very much terrified,

33:24.627 --> 33:25.712
didn't wanna talk to me,

33:25.712 --> 33:27.088
didn't wanna have anything to do with me

33:27.088 --> 33:28.089
or the investigation.

33:28.089 --> 33:29.841
And I told him, if you don't talk to me,

33:29.841 --> 33:31.467
you're gonna have to talk to the cops,

33:31.467 --> 33:33.469
and they're gonna really bust your ass.

33:33.469 --> 33:35.304
And I think he was terrified

33:35.304 --> 33:37.015
of being outed in this community,

33:38.224 --> 33:42.937
because it's such a small
town, not a lot of gay people.

33:43.813 --> 33:46.858
And so he did talk to me, he told me that,

33:46.858 --> 33:49.986
he didn't have anything to
do with Gary's disappearance.

33:49.986 --> 33:54.532
He was sad and upset that
Gary had disappeared,

33:54.532 --> 33:57.076
he didn't know what happened to him.

33:57.076 --> 33:58.536
I guess I did believe him.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.581
He really didn't wanna discuss it,

34:01.581 --> 34:04.375
but ultimately, when I
did check out his alibi,

34:04.375 --> 34:07.211
he was cleared as a suspect.

34:07.211 --> 34:08.504
(sheep bleating)

34:08.504 --> 34:11.340
(ground rustling)

34:12.717 --> 34:15.636
- Hey guys, now that I'm
done chasing sheep around

34:15.636 --> 34:17.722
like a crazy person in the mountains.

34:18.765 --> 34:21.225
I've seen a lot out here, mining camps,

34:21.225 --> 34:26.230
mines, abandoned towns,
buildings, remnants of the past,

34:26.689 --> 34:29.233
but the coolest and my
favorite personally,

34:29.233 --> 34:31.736
is all the Native American remnants,

34:31.736 --> 34:33.404
I love finding arrowheads

34:33.404 --> 34:36.741
and seeing petroglyphs on mountain sides.

34:36.741 --> 34:39.535
Just old writing from the native people

34:39.535 --> 34:43.122
who lived here long before
any settlers moved in.

34:43.122 --> 34:45.249
To me, that's the coolest stuff to see.

34:45.249 --> 34:47.502
But it's getting dark
now, the sun's setting

34:47.502 --> 34:50.421
I think I'm gonna call it
a night and get settled in,

34:50.421 --> 34:51.380
in my camp.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.257
(ground rustling)

34:53.257 --> 34:56.636
- They were still processing
the crime scene and everything

34:56.636 --> 35:01.641
and they came across an
envelope in his center console,

35:02.767 --> 35:04.769
it had a (muffled speaking) money in it.

35:05.937 --> 35:10.942
To me that said that whoever he was with,

35:11.567 --> 35:15.154
wasn't there to take his money

35:15.154 --> 35:17.782
or anything that he might have had.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.246
(sentimental music)

35:35.675 --> 35:39.846
I woke to the police
officers knocking on my door.

35:43.891 --> 35:46.978
And they were informing me that
they called off the search.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.690
And while they're explaining things to me,

35:52.024 --> 35:53.401
I'm seeing them talking,

35:56.362 --> 35:58.155
I'm not comprehending any of the it,

36:01.117 --> 36:03.286
everything was just kind of flashing.

36:03.286 --> 36:07.874
And, I'm seeing their faces,
and I'm seeing their lips move,

36:07.874 --> 36:10.751
and then they're looking
at me like I'm crazy.

36:11.878 --> 36:15.631
And next thing I know, I'm on a stretcher.

36:15.631 --> 36:20.595
(heart throbbing)
(beep sounds)

36:22.972 --> 36:27.977
And taken to the ER where
they had to give me hydration

36:29.228 --> 36:34.233
and IV with fluids and
medicine that helped me sleep,

36:36.360 --> 36:40.781
and for the first time
since all of this started,

36:41.699 --> 36:43.784
I got 10 hours of sleep.

36:44.660 --> 36:47.455
- This was the largest search and rescue

36:47.455 --> 36:49.582
that Nevada had ever seen.

36:49.582 --> 36:53.586
And when they finally called it off,

36:53.586 --> 36:55.963
everyone was just so shocked.

36:55.963 --> 36:59.842
But, you mean, you can't search
the entire state of Nevada,

36:59.842 --> 37:02.178
it's just too vast, it's too broad,

37:02.178 --> 37:07.141
and it had been so long that
the chances of finding him

37:07.141 --> 37:11.270
and finding him alive were slim to none.

37:11.270 --> 37:13.564
- The investigation was dead in the water,

37:13.564 --> 37:15.566
we didn't have any leads,

37:15.566 --> 37:18.569
the fingerprints in the truck
didn't match any database,

37:18.569 --> 37:20.821
so we didn't know what to do.

37:20.821 --> 37:21.656
But then.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.700
(intense music)

37:28.913 --> 37:30.665
Gary's followers started calling.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.297
And this whole thing
was turned on its head.

37:40.758 --> 37:42.051
- So I'm at my desk,

37:42.051 --> 37:44.136
and I'm going through the show notes,

37:44.136 --> 37:45.471
I'm getting ready to go on air

37:45.471 --> 37:47.598
and my producer comes through
my door, and he's like,

37:47.598 --> 37:50.935
you have a phone call, you
have to take this phone call.

37:50.935 --> 37:54.772
And I get on the phone, and
it's one of our listeners.

37:54.772 --> 37:59.318
And he's telling me that I
have to look into Gary's blog.

37:59.318 --> 38:03.781
He's going on and on about
this crazy story about Gary,

38:03.781 --> 38:08.035
and he's telling me that he
thinks he knows where he is,

38:08.035 --> 38:11.247
he thinks he knows what happened to him.

38:11.247 --> 38:15.710
And that I have to go and
look at this blog right now.

38:16.877 --> 38:18.337
- My friend Monica calls me

38:18.337 --> 38:21.507
and tells me that it's all over the news

38:21.507 --> 38:26.512
that all these people are
calling into the radio station.

38:26.887 --> 38:31.100
And she tells me that they're
talking about Gary's blog

38:31.100 --> 38:33.978
and the fact that it needs to be read

38:33.978 --> 38:35.938
and that there's comments and everything.

38:35.938 --> 38:40.151
And so once I got discharged,

38:40.151 --> 38:41.652
I went straight to Gary's house,

38:41.652 --> 38:45.156
so I could read the blog
and see what all this was

38:45.156 --> 38:47.158
that they were talking about.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.702
- Unfortunately, Beverly
found out about Gary's blog

38:49.702 --> 38:53.247
hours before we did, and
she went right over there,

38:53.247 --> 38:55.416
and really messed things up.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.960
- Hey guys, it's me again.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.795
A lot of people have
been following the blog

38:59.795 --> 39:01.672
and new to the blog and been saying,

39:01.672 --> 39:04.759
I'm just trying to copy
"Naked and Afraid".

39:04.759 --> 39:08.346
And as you can tell, I'm not
naked or afraid out here,

39:08.346 --> 39:10.514
so I'm not trying to copy the show and,

39:11.640 --> 39:14.852
also my ex loved that
show, so I'm sick of it,

39:14.852 --> 39:17.646
there's a reason why
people are called exes.

39:17.646 --> 39:20.358
- So while I'm trying to
navigate through everything

39:20.358 --> 39:22.401
on his blog,

39:22.401 --> 39:24.779
going through the operator
stuff and everything

39:24.779 --> 39:31.160
and I finally get in there
and I realize he has 50,000,

39:32.703 --> 39:34.371
50,000 viewers.

39:37.124 --> 39:39.043
I was shocked.

39:39.043 --> 39:42.630
- Not a single person in Gary's
life knew about his blog,

39:42.630 --> 39:44.048
which was really shocking

39:44.048 --> 39:47.009
considering the fact that
he had 50,000 followers.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.430
That really says something,
if you think about it.

39:55.810 --> 39:59.313
- Of course, I immediately
jump on my computer

39:59.313 --> 40:03.818
and I go to his blog, and
I'll never forget the title,

40:03.818 --> 40:05.653
because I actually thought
it was really clever.

40:05.653 --> 40:09.281
It was called "Don't
Hike With Headphones".

40:09.281 --> 40:11.325
- Hey guys up here at
the top of the mountain,

40:11.325 --> 40:15.371
as you can see, there's
the great view behind me.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.959
One of the questions I've got
asked on the blog a lot was,

40:19.959 --> 40:21.919
what dangers (muffled speaking),

40:21.919 --> 40:24.004
are there any threatening animals

40:24.004 --> 40:25.840
like rattlesnakes and mountain lions?

40:25.840 --> 40:29.635
And, yeah, there're rattlesnakes
at the lower elevations,

40:29.635 --> 40:31.887
you might have noticed I
don't hike with headphones

40:31.887 --> 40:34.431
or anything on so I can listen for them.

40:34.431 --> 40:37.852
- And it's your basic,
survivalist type blog,

40:37.852 --> 40:41.230
you know, how to build a
fire, how to filter water,

40:41.230 --> 40:43.107
and I just start scrolling through

40:43.107 --> 40:45.067
and I scroll and scroll
all the way to the,

40:45.067 --> 40:47.862
like the latest videos that he had posted.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.405
- I'm trying to navigate

40:49.405 --> 40:52.616
to find out where these
notifications are coming from

40:52.616 --> 40:56.078
because he is getting
notification after notification,

40:56.078 --> 40:59.540
I mean, it's ding, ding, ding, ding.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.835
- So I was driving when I
found out Gary had a blog,

41:02.835 --> 41:06.797
I pulled over and looked
for it on my phone.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.008
And the first thing that I noticed

41:09.008 --> 41:10.801
was that he didn't go by his real name,

41:10.801 --> 41:13.262
he went by Scorpion Sam.

41:13.262 --> 41:15.514
- My biggest thing I've ever ran into

41:15.514 --> 41:18.100
was I got stung by a scorpion,

41:18.100 --> 41:20.603
kicking over a rock once,

41:20.603 --> 41:25.191
had to go to the hospital
once I got back to my truck,

41:25.191 --> 41:27.776
that was the day I hiked
with a swelling up hand.

41:29.403 --> 41:32.156
- I'm finally able to
get to the notifications

41:32.156 --> 41:34.408
and this notification pops up

41:34.408 --> 41:37.870
and they're saying, I bet he found it,

41:41.040 --> 41:42.625
and that something bad happened,

41:42.625 --> 41:47.630
and I'm thinking, they're
saying he found it?

41:48.297 --> 41:50.007
And something bad happened?

41:50.007 --> 41:51.383
Found what?

41:52.343 --> 41:55.846
- And then came Gary's
now infamous video post.

41:57.056 --> 42:00.309
I have worked a lot of
strange cases in my career,

42:00.309 --> 42:05.022
and Gary's by far was the most unusual,

42:05.940 --> 42:08.859
just the way that he described
what he was looking at,

42:08.859 --> 42:12.988
what he saw, how terrified he was,

42:12.988 --> 42:17.993
it just really scares me.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.667
- So I started watching
the second to last video

42:24.667 --> 42:25.918
on Gary's blog.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.671
And he's at his home
and he's sitting there

42:28.671 --> 42:31.090
and he's telling his viewers

42:33.550 --> 42:37.304
basically what he came across
on his last expedition.

42:37.304 --> 42:39.974
- I saw his last three videos

42:39.974 --> 42:40.849
and,

42:43.644 --> 42:44.812
what I saw,

42:47.898 --> 42:50.568
changed everything.

42:52.236 --> 42:54.238
(ominous music)

43:00.661 --> 43:03.372
- He's pretty worked up in this video,

43:03.372 --> 43:06.542
you can tell he's nervous, he's scared.

43:06.542 --> 43:08.711
- As soon as his video started,

43:11.171 --> 43:15.884
I could tell he was troubled by something,

43:15.884 --> 43:18.470
something had him so unnerved.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.850
He was three days into his expedition,

43:22.850 --> 43:27.271
and he started to smell smoke and that,

43:27.271 --> 43:29.356
and he was out in the middle of nowhere.

43:29.356 --> 43:34.278
So he got curious and
started to look around.

43:35.154 --> 43:36.989
- He comes across this cabin,

43:36.989 --> 43:40.951
and it's not like a nice cabin,
it's like a makeshift cabin,

43:40.951 --> 43:45.956
almost kind of like a
homeless type of structure,

43:46.165 --> 43:47.499
sticks and twigs,

43:47.499 --> 43:50.878
and there's smoke coming
out of the chimney.

43:52.212 --> 43:56.759
And Gary's not someone to
be scared of someone else,

43:56.759 --> 43:57.760
out in the wilderness,

43:57.760 --> 44:02.765
but he said he was just
like frozen in his tracks,

44:03.265 --> 44:06.977
and he just felt this like sixth sense

44:06.977 --> 44:10.105
of basically impending doom.

44:10.981 --> 44:15.819
- It was the look on his
face, that really got to me,

44:15.819 --> 44:19.114
when he described this
cabin out in Nevada.

44:21.742 --> 44:25.329
- He said that the longer
he stood and looked at it

44:27.373 --> 44:31.627
the more spooked that he
got the feeling of dread,

44:31.627 --> 44:34.963
the sixth sense that he
needed to get out of there.

44:34.963 --> 44:38.842
- And he wanted nothing
to do with that place.

44:38.842 --> 44:42.346
And so, he hightails it out of there

44:42.346 --> 44:46.517
and he goes to sleep in his tent,

44:46.517 --> 44:51.105
I remember this because he talks
about how he was so scared,

44:51.105 --> 44:54.024
he slept with his shoes on all night.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.567
You know, he didn't bring his firearms,

44:55.567 --> 45:00.572
so he was totally just vulnerable
out there and terrified.

45:02.783 --> 45:07.788
And he wakes up the next
morning, and there's footprints,

45:08.205 --> 45:11.250
and they're barefoot footprints.

45:11.250 --> 45:13.460
- These two things are now connected,

45:13.460 --> 45:14.753
we had something to go on.

45:16.338 --> 45:18.340
(ominous music)

45:24.930 --> 45:26.890
- [Beverly] The hike back to his track,

45:26.890 --> 45:28.767
which took three days,

45:28.767 --> 45:32.187
he felt like somebody was following him.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.565
(ominous music)

45:35.149 --> 45:38.986
- So this was a really sad story to me,

45:38.986 --> 45:42.156
to see Gary's followers turn on him,

45:42.156 --> 45:44.908
that blog was everything to him.

45:44.908 --> 45:49.913
He really admired them,
and their comments,

45:52.499 --> 45:54.835
it was something really special to him.

45:54.835 --> 45:59.840
And to see them go from
loving him to bullying him,

46:00.507 --> 46:03.635
calling him a loser, a liar,

46:03.635 --> 46:07.556
and putting him down, it
was really sad to see.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.227
- And the comments are like,

46:12.227 --> 46:15.898
everyone's kind of just
like, well, go back,

46:16.732 --> 46:18.400
take video, show us this place,

46:18.400 --> 46:21.195
does this place even
exist, is this even real?

46:21.195 --> 46:23.822
And he's getting like
really hit by his followers,

46:23.822 --> 46:26.784
basically, they're kind of bullying him,

46:27.659 --> 46:30.329
they don't believe that
he came across this,

46:30.329 --> 46:33.832
they go to his blog for a reason,

46:33.832 --> 46:35.667
and now they feel like he's just

46:35.667 --> 46:38.587
getting into ghost stories or something.

46:38.587 --> 46:39.421
And so they,

46:40.464 --> 46:45.260
I really feel like he fell
into a bit of cyber bullying

46:45.260 --> 46:50.140
and the fact that they were not gonna be

46:50.140 --> 46:51.850
his faithful followers anymore,

46:51.850 --> 46:56.480
unless he goes back and
proves that he saw this,

46:56.480 --> 46:58.398
he experienced this.

46:58.398 --> 47:01.068
(air whooshing)

47:04.071 --> 47:07.616
- You know, it broke my
heart to read the comments

47:07.616 --> 47:12.621
that said that he was
nothing but a lonely loser,

47:12.829 --> 47:16.416
and that all he was doing

47:16.416 --> 47:20.712
was trying to get
attention by making shit up

47:20.712 --> 47:23.799
and that they didn't believe him.

47:25.592 --> 47:27.761
- I actually didn't know about the blog,

47:28.595 --> 47:31.348
but I knew he was doing something

47:31.348 --> 47:36.228
because he was always in
the backyard making videos,

47:36.228 --> 47:38.438
telling the camera how to make a campfire,

47:39.898 --> 47:41.608
or I always heard him in his room

47:41.608 --> 47:43.694
like giving survival tips and things.

47:44.528 --> 47:47.239
- [Gary] Hey, guys, just
walking through the woods here.

47:48.115 --> 47:50.742
It's a beautiful day in
the backwoods in Nevada.

47:50.742 --> 47:52.661
But a lot of people asked what I would do

47:52.661 --> 47:54.079
if I got lost back here,

47:55.247 --> 47:59.501
I had to spends several
more days than I planned on,

47:59.501 --> 48:00.836
I guess first thing I would do

48:00.836 --> 48:04.673
would be find a nice nutritious cow patty,

48:05.591 --> 48:07.759
because there're so yummy.

48:07.759 --> 48:11.054
I'm just kidding, you
don't wanna eat cow shit.

48:11.054 --> 48:11.972
That will be bad.

48:12.806 --> 48:15.893
But there are ways you can
scavenger for food out here.

48:17.311 --> 48:20.272
(train engine roaring)

48:20.272 --> 48:23.483
(train hooting)

48:23.483 --> 48:26.194
- I'm so upset by everything and,

48:27.112 --> 48:31.783
I wanted to download this

48:31.783 --> 48:35.495
and do what I could so that
I could take it to the cops,

48:35.495 --> 48:40.500
and during all the frustration
and the upset and everything,

48:42.794 --> 48:45.005
I accidentally deleted it.

48:47.633 --> 48:51.011
- Beverly really beat herself
up about deleting the video,

48:51.011 --> 48:53.972
and I felt bad for her.

48:53.972 --> 48:57.684
I didn't wanna press it because
I knew she felt terrible,

48:57.684 --> 48:59.936
her brother was missing.

48:59.936 --> 49:04.149
But it was a missed
opportunity definitely,

49:04.149 --> 49:05.817
and a definite disappointment.

49:06.818 --> 49:11.782
- The last video of Gary on that blog,

49:11.907 --> 49:16.578
is him basically telling his followers,

49:16.578 --> 49:19.915
okay, here I go, I'll go back.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.584
And he doesn't look okay about it.

49:23.543 --> 49:27.965
- Gary's final video is truly haunting.

49:27.965 --> 49:32.427
And it is really the
beginning of a bigger mystery.

49:35.263 --> 49:39.726
- Gary's last video that
he posted to his blog

49:39.726 --> 49:43.730
said that he was gonna go back out

49:46.316 --> 49:50.946
and record everything
and prove to everyone

49:50.946 --> 49:55.158
that this was real, that
this really existed.

50:00.914 --> 50:04.960
It's the last time that
he ever posted anything

50:04.960 --> 50:06.586
or anybody heard from him.

50:08.213 --> 50:10.215
(ominous music)

50:18.140 --> 50:20.809
(air whooshing)

50:29.401 --> 50:31.570
- Hey guys, I'm back.

50:31.570 --> 50:32.612
Wanted to make a video

50:32.612 --> 50:35.991
about the different comments
people left on my last video.

50:38.034 --> 50:40.954
A lot of you were coming up
with some crazy theories,

50:40.954 --> 50:44.291
what was out there,
what I saw in the woods.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.461
Some of you don't believe it,

50:47.461 --> 50:49.337
some of you are asking for the location

50:49.337 --> 50:52.048
and wanna find it yourself.

50:52.048 --> 50:53.759
I'm really against people going out

50:53.759 --> 50:57.012
in the backwoods in
Nevada without experience,

50:57.012 --> 50:58.722
there's a lot dangers out there,

50:58.722 --> 51:02.184
from old mines to just random people

51:02.184 --> 51:04.436
and you can get lost easily,

51:04.436 --> 51:06.730
the scenery looks a lot the same,

51:06.730 --> 51:08.774
and if there's no trails,

51:08.774 --> 51:12.277
you can get lost and turn around
and be out there for days.

51:12.277 --> 51:14.446
And if you don't bring
enough food or water,

51:14.446 --> 51:15.530
you're in real danger.

51:17.407 --> 51:19.117
So I don't wanna give out the location

51:19.117 --> 51:23.079
and just be the one that
causes a whole bunch of people

51:23.079 --> 51:25.040
to go out in the backwoods in Nevada.

51:26.124 --> 51:29.169
I'll go out there, find the shelter again.

51:29.169 --> 51:32.130
This time, I'll bring
my camera and firearm,

51:32.130 --> 51:33.840
I have to do some work first,

51:33.840 --> 51:36.551
but I plan on leaving on the 22nd,

51:36.551 --> 51:39.387
and I'll need a good six
days to be out there again.

51:40.430 --> 51:43.266
It's a good three days
in, and three days back,

51:43.266 --> 51:45.685
but we're gonna find out what this is,

51:45.685 --> 51:49.564
and look forward to another video,

51:49.564 --> 51:51.233
once we finally get out there,

51:52.275 --> 51:54.277
I'll have something for you guys posted.

51:58.657 --> 52:00.659
(ominous music)

52:01.326 --> 52:03.245
- He goes and that's it.

52:03.245 --> 52:04.538
And that's the last,

52:05.580 --> 52:08.041
that's the last video of Gary.

52:08.041 --> 52:11.545
And no one knows where he was going.

52:12.754 --> 52:17.175
So the search is so
vast and Nevada is huge,

52:17.175 --> 52:20.428
and he could be anywhere.

52:21.721 --> 52:23.723
(ominous music)

52:34.860 --> 52:37.279
This place that he talks
about could be anywhere.

52:41.867 --> 52:43.285
- This became a perfect storm

52:43.285 --> 52:46.872
because now we knew what Gary was doing,

52:46.872 --> 52:48.623
we just had no idea where.

52:49.875 --> 52:54.880
- I had no idea that he
had this whole other life,

52:55.005 --> 52:57.966
this blog, all these
followers and everything

52:57.966 --> 52:59.175
had I known that,

53:00.051 --> 53:04.598
I would have never, ever,
let him go back out there.

53:05.891 --> 53:09.019
- This whole case turned
from a missing persons

53:09.853 --> 53:12.898
to a huge mystery.

53:12.898 --> 53:14.399
Whose cabin was this?

53:14.399 --> 53:16.234
I mean, who lives out there?

53:16.234 --> 53:17.402
Where is this cabin?

53:17.402 --> 53:19.905
I mean, if it's in the middle of nowhere,

53:19.905 --> 53:23.325
what type of person lives
in the middle of nowhere?

53:23.325 --> 53:27.245
And if you're about to
go find that person,

53:27.245 --> 53:29.706
I don't know if they're gonna
be too happy to be found.

53:29.706 --> 53:32.167
I mean, if they're out there that far,

53:32.167 --> 53:34.169
they're out there that far for a reason.

53:34.878 --> 53:36.880
(ominous music)

53:40.425 --> 53:43.845
- Once the radio station
broadcasts about it,

53:43.845 --> 53:45.680
his blog and everything,

53:45.680 --> 53:47.933
everybody just went crazy

53:47.933 --> 53:50.268
before the cops could even take it down.

53:50.268 --> 53:55.273
The conspiracy theories
were just everywhere,

53:55.482 --> 54:00.487
from witches to aliens,
area 51, you name it.

54:02.322 --> 54:04.449
- People started coming
out of the woodwork

54:04.449 --> 54:06.451
and everyone had a theory

54:06.451 --> 54:11.456
as to who the cabin belonged
to, what was in the cabin.

54:12.499 --> 54:16.962
There were some comments about
Gary had discovered a witch,

54:16.962 --> 54:19.673
and she was making secret potions

54:19.673 --> 54:22.050
and somehow he had gotten involved,

54:22.050 --> 54:26.221
and I mean it was crazy.

54:26.221 --> 54:28.056
Other people thought it was just a hermit,

54:28.056 --> 54:30.558
you know someone who just
wanted to be left alone.

54:32.268 --> 54:34.688
People thought that maybe
it was a government,

54:35.647 --> 54:39.109
secret government operation, aliens.

54:41.569 --> 54:42.737
I mean it's,

54:43.780 --> 54:44.948
I could go on and on

54:44.948 --> 54:47.534
about the many theories
that people thought.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.953
- The only reasonable
explanation I could come up with

54:49.953 --> 54:52.998
was maybe, Gary had stumbled upon

54:52.998 --> 54:56.084
an illegal marijuana growing operation

54:56.084 --> 54:58.295
out there in the middle
of nowhere in Nevada

54:59.254 --> 55:03.049
and they killed him for
it, it has happened before.

55:04.300 --> 55:05.135
But,

55:07.721 --> 55:08.805
I was wrong.

55:12.851 --> 55:17.856
- I just couldn't shake
this sickening feeling.

55:19.399 --> 55:21.401
(ominous music)

55:28.408 --> 55:30.243
Before I knew it, the cops showed up

55:30.243 --> 55:32.620
and they had known all about his blog

55:32.620 --> 55:36.082
and I was actually on the
computer when they got there.

55:36.082 --> 55:40.628
And they gathered everything
up, seized everything,

55:40.628 --> 55:43.048
including his hard drives.

55:43.048 --> 55:44.674
- [Gary] Guys,

55:44.674 --> 55:46.134
another model train video here,

55:46.134 --> 55:48.762
I just got back from a flea market,

55:48.762 --> 55:51.097
and look what I picked up today.

55:52.599 --> 55:57.479
Got a nice little HO diesel locomotive,

55:57.479 --> 55:59.564
lettered for one of my favorite railroads,

55:59.564 --> 56:01.649
it's called the California Western,

56:02.734 --> 56:04.736
out of Northern California.

56:04.736 --> 56:07.739
(plastic train rattling)

56:07.739 --> 56:09.949
Set that down.

56:09.949 --> 56:14.954
Then got this brand new steam
engine for the Santa Fe.

56:15.872 --> 56:17.874
(ominous music)

56:24.464 --> 56:27.675
- My private investigator
called and said that,

56:27.675 --> 56:32.680
the detectives on the case
wanted to meet with me.

56:32.722 --> 56:36.601
So I ended up going down
to the precinct and,

56:39.562 --> 56:42.607
they kept asking me, is
there anything you need?

56:42.607 --> 56:44.192
Have you eaten today?

56:45.318 --> 56:47.737
Just beating around the bush

56:47.737 --> 56:52.742
and I finally asked
them, what is going on?

56:54.577 --> 56:55.411
- [Man] It's back on.

56:55.411 --> 56:58.248
(dramatic chase music)

56:58.248 --> 57:00.083
- We are back with a break in the case

57:00.083 --> 57:02.252
of missing hiker, Gary Hinge.

57:02.252 --> 57:04.254
Was made yesterday when his backpack

57:04.254 --> 57:08.383
was discovered by a couple
camping in White Pine County.

57:08.383 --> 57:09.843
When they woke up in the morning,

57:09.843 --> 57:10.969
they found the backpack

57:10.969 --> 57:14.097
had been intentionally
placed in their campsite.

57:14.097 --> 57:15.640
What they found inside

57:15.640 --> 57:19.185
has sent a shockwave
through the state of Nevada.

57:19.185 --> 57:23.231
Hinge's truck was found parked
in Eureka earlier this month.

57:23.231 --> 57:25.442
But police now say they have evidence

57:25.442 --> 57:26.818
that it was parked there,

57:26.818 --> 57:29.821
to throw off investigators
searching for him.

57:29.821 --> 57:34.200
- They woke up to find Gary's backpack

57:37.495 --> 57:40.165
draped on a shovel that they had there.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.335
And when they opened it,

57:46.838 --> 57:49.174
Gary's belongings were in there,

57:50.842 --> 57:52.844
(ominous music)

57:56.848 --> 57:58.850
as well as a severed hand,

58:01.269 --> 58:02.103
Gary's hand.

58:03.062 --> 58:05.982
(ominous music)

58:22.874 --> 58:25.251
- [Bill] The way that his hand was severed

58:25.251 --> 58:28.171
was incredibly violent.

58:28.171 --> 58:32.383
The way that it was chopped
off, was just gruesome.

58:32.383 --> 58:34.177
- It was deliberately placed there,

58:34.177 --> 58:38.556
because someone wanted it to be found.

58:38.556 --> 58:40.058
- The forensic showed,

58:41.351 --> 58:44.979
that his hand had been severed,

58:46.814 --> 58:49.651
for more than five weeks.

58:49.651 --> 58:52.904
- And it was still
clutching a video camera.

58:53.780 --> 58:56.574
And what's even more crazy was,

58:58.326 --> 59:01.538
the hand wasn't like torn off from a body,

59:01.538 --> 59:03.957
it was a clean cut.

59:03.957 --> 59:05.250
- I was gutted,

59:07.794 --> 59:10.713
by the fact that he had suffered.

59:11.714 --> 59:13.716
- Once the camera was discovered,

59:13.716 --> 59:17.303
everybody wanted to know, is there a tape?

59:18.513 --> 59:20.265
And does the tape work?

59:20.265 --> 59:22.850
And what's on the tape?

59:22.850 --> 59:24.936
(camera shuttering)

59:24.936 --> 59:27.647
- We were very anxious for the crime lab

59:27.647 --> 59:29.148
to process the evidence.

59:29.148 --> 59:30.108
(camera shutters)

59:30.108 --> 59:33.778
And sure enough, when they did,

59:33.778 --> 59:36.072
the memory chip was still in the camera.

59:37.240 --> 59:40.076
(camera shutters)

59:40.868 --> 59:45.081
(ominous music intensifies)

59:52.630 --> 59:56.050
It was truly terrifying to watch

59:56.050 --> 1:00:01.055
and I can't even imagine the true horror

1:00:01.472 --> 1:00:03.141
that he faced out there.

1:00:04.309 --> 1:00:08.730
- Bill calls me and the
forensic investigators

1:00:08.730 --> 1:00:13.693
have video of Gary's final moments

1:00:13.985 --> 1:00:17.780
and so they take us into a room.

1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:20.700
- The team thought it would be best

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:25.079
if I sat down with Beverly and
watched the videos with her,

1:00:25.079 --> 1:00:28.833
because I had a relationship with her

1:00:28.833 --> 1:00:31.586
and I had a kind of a special rapport.

1:00:31.586 --> 1:00:33.171
So they thought it would probably be best

1:00:33.171 --> 1:00:34.922
if maybe I sat down with her first.

1:00:36.966 --> 1:00:38.843
- Bill started the first video

1:00:38.843 --> 1:00:45.475
and there was Gary shining his
light around, saying hello.

1:00:47.810 --> 1:00:51.981
And the innocence in his voice,

1:00:54.734 --> 1:00:56.527
I just,

1:00:58.613 --> 1:00:59.781
I couldn't do it.

1:01:00.907 --> 1:01:01.991
I

1:01:03.534 --> 1:01:04.744
I had to stop.

1:01:07.997 --> 1:01:11.459
And then Bill finished watching.

1:01:16.631 --> 1:01:18.633
(ominous music)

1:01:27.308 --> 1:01:29.894
- [Bill] The clips begin
like all the other clips,

1:01:31.187 --> 1:01:32.730
Gary's even smiling,

1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:36.859
but he has no idea what's about to happen.

1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:41.739
- Hey guys, a little video update.

1:01:41.739 --> 1:01:43.116
I am.

1:01:43.116 --> 1:01:43.950
(thunder roars)

1:01:43.950 --> 1:01:44.951
Oh, there's thunder.

1:01:45.785 --> 1:01:48.579
Storm's coming in, I
gotta make this quick.

1:01:48.579 --> 1:01:50.248
Got a whole nother ridge line to climb

1:01:50.248 --> 1:01:53.626
before I get to the spot
where I saw that shelter

1:01:53.626 --> 1:01:57.088
but I'm about halfway
there, a day and a half in.

1:01:59.507 --> 1:02:00.842
We'll see what we find.

1:02:02.093 --> 1:02:05.555
Climbed over one mountain range
already, got one more to go.

1:02:06.639 --> 1:02:08.099
And, better make it quick,

1:02:08.099 --> 1:02:11.352
because that storm's coming in fast.

1:02:11.352 --> 1:02:13.104
We'll see what's on the other side.

1:02:14.021 --> 1:02:14.939
I got (muffled speaking) ways to go,

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:16.107
but, weird thing is,

1:02:16.107 --> 1:02:19.527
I'm already distinctly smelling the smoke,

1:02:19.527 --> 1:02:21.362
like I smelled last time.

1:02:21.362 --> 1:02:24.365
There's no fires around, there
shouldn't be anyone out here,

1:02:25.366 --> 1:02:28.244
but it's very faint but very
distinct smell of smoke.

1:02:29.620 --> 1:02:30.663
Kind of getting creeped out

1:02:30.663 --> 1:02:33.624
but not as much as I was last time yet.

1:02:33.624 --> 1:02:35.376
We'll see what happens.

1:02:35.376 --> 1:02:37.378
Look for another video update soon.

1:02:57.732 --> 1:02:59.317
(beep sound)

1:02:59.317 --> 1:03:01.986
(air whooshing)

1:03:36.771 --> 1:03:38.272
(beep sound)

1:03:38.272 --> 1:03:40.191
(air whooshing)

1:03:40.191 --> 1:03:43.027
(rattling sounds)

1:03:44.237 --> 1:03:47.073
(rattling sounds)

1:04:04.757 --> 1:04:07.552
(camera rattling)

1:04:09.303 --> 1:04:10.763
(beep sound)

1:04:10.763 --> 1:04:13.432
(air whooshing)

1:04:18.604 --> 1:04:21.440
(camera rattling)

1:04:23.526 --> 1:04:25.027
(beep sound)

1:04:25.027 --> 1:04:27.697
(air whooshing)

1:04:48.217 --> 1:04:50.887
(air whooshing)

1:04:58.644 --> 1:05:01.564
(gravel crunching)

1:05:03.733 --> 1:05:06.360
(air whooshing)

1:05:14.744 --> 1:05:16.287
(beep sound)

1:05:16.287 --> 1:05:18.956
(air whooshing)

1:05:29.258 --> 1:05:32.178
All right, here's the final marker.

1:05:39.560 --> 1:05:43.147
(indistinct music playing)

1:05:59.622 --> 1:06:03.209
(indistinct ominous music)

1:06:34.865 --> 1:06:38.744
(gravel crunching sounds)

1:06:38.744 --> 1:06:42.331
(indistinct ominous music)

1:07:20.202 --> 1:07:21.036
(beep sound)

1:07:21.036 --> 1:07:23.706
(air whooshing)

1:07:29.211 --> 1:07:32.047
(rattling sounds)

1:07:32.923 --> 1:07:33.758
(beep sound)

1:07:33.758 --> 1:07:36.427
(air whooshing)

1:07:42.641 --> 1:07:44.518
(rattling sounds)

1:07:54.779 --> 1:07:57.448
(air whooshing)

1:08:24.308 --> 1:08:27.144
(camera rattling)

1:08:37.321 --> 1:08:40.074
(ominous sounds)

1:08:49.333 --> 1:08:52.920
(indistinct ominous music)

1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:22.158
(camera rattling)

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:25.744
(indistinct ominous music)

1:09:33.502 --> 1:09:36.422
(fluttering sound)

1:10:10.456 --> 1:10:13.375
(gravel crunching)

1:10:17.212 --> 1:10:20.507
(ticking sound)

1:10:20.507 --> 1:10:23.427
(gravel crunching)

1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:52.039
(beep sound)

1:10:55.459 --> 1:10:58.128
(ticking sound)

1:11:05.052 --> 1:11:07.346
(rattling sounds)

1:11:07.346 --> 1:11:10.099
(gunshot blasts)

1:11:13.602 --> 1:11:16.271
(ticking sound)

1:11:17.731 --> 1:11:18.649
(groaning sounds)

1:11:18.649 --> 1:11:22.236
(gunshot blasts)

1:11:22.236 --> 1:11:24.989
(gunshot blasts)

1:11:38.877 --> 1:11:40.129
(beep sound)

1:11:40.129 --> 1:11:42.506
(gunshot blasts)

1:11:42.506 --> 1:11:45.259
(gunshot blasts)

1:11:52.141 --> 1:11:54.351
(air whooshing)

1:11:54.351 --> 1:11:56.603
(beep sound)

1:11:56.603 --> 1:11:59.356
(ticking sounds)

1:12:07.656 --> 1:12:10.034
(beep sound)

1:12:16.123 --> 1:12:18.709
(camera rattling)

1:12:18.709 --> 1:12:21.462
(ticking sounds)

1:12:29.011 --> 1:12:31.847
(camera rattling)

1:12:47.488 --> 1:12:48.489
(beep sound)

1:12:48.489 --> 1:12:50.741
(rattling sounds)

1:12:50.741 --> 1:12:53.368
(ticking sound)

1:12:54.912 --> 1:12:57.581
(air whooshing)

1:13:03.879 --> 1:13:06.799
(stones crunching)

1:13:33.242 --> 1:13:36.078
(camera rattling)

1:13:43.961 --> 1:13:46.797
(camera rattling)

1:13:53.804 --> 1:13:56.723
(crunching sounds)

1:14:01.019 --> 1:14:04.106
(insects fluttering)

1:14:57.284 --> 1:14:59.703
(Gary gasps)

1:15:14.009 --> 1:15:16.678
(air whooshing)

1:15:24.061 --> 1:15:27.523
- [Gal] From what you do see
from the person in the video,

1:15:27.523 --> 1:15:31.151
you can tell that they have a
lot of physical deformities.

1:15:31.151 --> 1:15:34.029
And it's probably one of the main reasons

1:15:34.029 --> 1:15:38.909
why they chose to live where they lived,

1:15:38.909 --> 1:15:42.204
they felt shunned by society.

1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:48.543
- [Simon] When we found
out what actually happened,

1:15:51.046 --> 1:15:53.340
it was like this weight

1:15:53.340 --> 1:15:57.761
had been taken off of
Beverly and I's relationship.

1:15:57.761 --> 1:16:02.057
And now we're actually really close.

1:16:02.057 --> 1:16:04.977
And I actually consider
her kind of a big sister.

1:16:06.687 --> 1:16:08.689
(sentimental music)

1:16:17.406 --> 1:16:18.240
(stones crunching)

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:22.411
- [Gary] I'm just hiking
along, almost to the top.

1:16:24.371 --> 1:16:25.789
Over that mountain side.

1:16:29.334 --> 1:16:31.837
Still some thunder in the distance.

1:16:31.837 --> 1:16:34.298
(ground crunching)

1:16:34.298 --> 1:16:36.174
Amazing how far you can hike

1:16:36.174 --> 1:16:39.511
and only seeing a couple of deer,

1:16:39.511 --> 1:16:42.597
how much wildlife that I've seen,

1:16:42.597 --> 1:16:45.142
I'm sure they see me, stay hidden.

1:16:47.686 --> 1:16:52.691
But just a lot of sagebrush
and trees and peaceful desert,

1:16:56.612 --> 1:16:58.196
to walk.

1:16:58.196 --> 1:17:01.908
The great thing about
Nevada, wide open spaces.

1:17:05.329 --> 1:17:08.540
- Everybody immediately
wants to go and search

1:17:08.540 --> 1:17:09.374
for the one thing

1:17:09.374 --> 1:17:12.502
that they've been told
not to go search for.

1:17:12.502 --> 1:17:15.922
And so now there's this
whole band of influencers

1:17:15.922 --> 1:17:20.927
who are out there wanting
to find this person

1:17:22.971 --> 1:17:25.474
and post about it and blog about it

1:17:25.474 --> 1:17:27.851
and make a video about it.

1:17:27.851 --> 1:17:28.644
And,

1:17:30.979 --> 1:17:32.105
to me that's,

1:17:34.066 --> 1:17:35.567
I mean, that's terrifying.

1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:40.322
(ominous music)
