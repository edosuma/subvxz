12:25.712 --> 12:27.848
SERIOUSLY ABOUT
WHO YOU REALLY ARE...

12:27.915 --> 12:30.550
AND WHAT YOUR FUTURE
HAS IN STORE FOR YOU.

12:30.617 --> 12:34.955
OKAY, WELL, I GUESS I CAN
TAKE A COUPLE OF WEEKS OFF
FROM THE CLINIC.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.190
YOU KNOW, JUST TO GET
MY HEAD TOGETHER,

12:37.257 --> 12:39.893
AND MAYBE GO DOWN TO THE BEACH,
AND DO A LITTLE
SHOPPING WITH VIV.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.095

I COULD USE A TAN.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.397
I'M TALKING ABOUT
A COMPLETE BREAK,

12:44.464 --> 12:46.599
A TOTAL CHANGE
OF SCENERY.

12:46.666 --> 12:50.537

ACTUALLY-- THAT I WENT TO
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

A GOOD ONE, MOM,

BUT YOU AND I BOTH KNOW I'M NOT
REALLY A RANCH KIND OF GIRL.

A REALLY GOOD THING FOR YOU.

13:03.851 --> 13:07.120

WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

13:12.860 --> 13:17.464
- MAYA, YOU LOVE ANIMALS.
- OKAY, MOM, JUST LISTEN
TO ME FOR ONE SECOND.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.934
I WAS ALMOST "B" CROWD ONCE,
AND THEN I STARTED TALKING
TO ANIMALS,

13:21.001 --> 13:22.903
AND I WENT
STRAIGHT TO A "C."

13:22.970 --> 13:25.772
I'D JUST BE HAPPY
BEING BACK TO B-MINUS,
LIKE THE SWIM-TEAM PEOPLE.

13:25.839 --> 13:30.710
- OR THE CHESS CLUB EVEN.
- I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

FOR SOMETHING I CAN'T CONTROL.

A GREAT IDEA.

A GREAT PLACE.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.423
OH, MY GOD, MY HAIR.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.340
I THINK I JUST WENT STRAIGHT
FROM A "C" TO AN "F."

14:33.406 --> 14:35.943
"F's" GOOD. "F."
"F" IS THE NEW "B."

14:36.009 --> 14:38.979

I LET YOU TALK ME INTO THIS.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.351
