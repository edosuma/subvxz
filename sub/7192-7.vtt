00:00.041 --> 00:02.502
- Hello, Jax.

00:02.585 --> 00:03.920
And who is this?

00:04.003 --> 00:04.921
- Dad.

00:05.004 --> 00:06.089
Is this our dad?

00:06.172 --> 00:07.799
- He's my dad, but we--

00:07.882 --> 00:09.008
- Jessie?

00:09.676 --> 00:12.095
- You bet ya.

00:12.178 --> 00:12.637
- What? How?

00:12.721 --> 00:14.764
You found them.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.265
Are you a witch like Jax?

00:16.349 --> 00:17.267
- Wizard.
- Wizard.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.393
- Wizard, whatever.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.061
Are you?
Are you really powerful?

00:20.145 --> 00:21.479
How many spells
can you cast?

00:21.563 --> 00:22.689
When will I get my powers?

00:22.772 --> 00:24.691
Will I be as strong as Jax?
Stronger?

00:24.774 --> 00:26.151
- Jessie, slow down.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.653
- You'll be stronger,
in time.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.947
Where's...

00:31.030 --> 00:32.573
Are you alone?

00:32.656 --> 00:34.451
- Dad, do you
recognize her?

00:34.534 --> 00:35.952
Do you know who she is?
- Of course.

00:36.035 --> 00:38.246
I'd recognize
the both of you

00:38.329 --> 00:40.373
if I hadn't seen
you in 100 years.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.751
But how'd you get here?

00:42.834 --> 00:44.085
You found her.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.295
How'd you know where to look?

00:45.378 --> 00:47.380
- I didn't.
She found us, but...

00:47.464 --> 00:48.465
- It really wasn't that hard.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.841
But you have a lot
of explaining to do.

00:49.924 --> 00:53.178
- [chuckles]
In due time.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.138
Oh, you don't know how much
I looked for you.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.348
- Dad, you didn't answer
my questions.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.600
How do you know who she is?

00:58.683 --> 01:00.685
And if she really is my sister,

01:00.769 --> 01:01.728
why don't I remember her?

01:01.811 --> 01:03.271
- Jax, enough
with the questions.

01:03.354 --> 01:03.980
There's plenty of time
we can talk about--

01:04.063 --> 01:06.733
- No, there isn't, Dad.

01:06.816 --> 01:07.859
This is really strange,
even for you.

01:07.942 --> 01:10.195
- Jax, I'm warning you.

01:10.278 --> 01:11.863
Cool down.

01:11.946 --> 01:13.406
- Where did you
come from, Jessie?

01:13.490 --> 01:15.825
And don't give me any of that
"I was raised by trolls" stuff,

01:15.909 --> 01:17.076
because I actually know trolls,

01:17.160 --> 01:19.996
and they happen to be
very nice and kind.

01:20.079 --> 01:21.831
- You know trolls?

01:21.915 --> 01:23.500
- Who did you
live with, Jessie?

01:23.583 --> 01:24.584
Who?

01:26.085 --> 01:27.504
- [laughs]

01:27.587 --> 01:30.173
- There, much better.

{\an8}- Come on, Jax, please?

02:14.884 --> 02:16.261
- For now,
just so that you guys

02:16.344 --> 02:19.138
can have
your little Kumbaya moment.

02:19.222 --> 02:21.724
-<i> We</i> can have
our Kumbaya moment.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.017
- "Kumbaya"?

02:23.101 --> 02:26.271
Is a Kumbaya moment
some sort of really cool spell?

02:26.354 --> 02:27.355
Can you fly?

02:27.438 --> 02:28.940
I want to fly.
- [chuckles]

02:29.023 --> 02:29.983
Come on.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.401
We'll have dinner
in the sunroom.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.235
- I have to go see Emma.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.445
- She's the Chosen One...

02:34.529 --> 02:35.738
[whispering]
And his girlfriend.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.448
- I know.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.450
I don't think you should go.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.161
We're gonna stick together
until I know what's going on.

02:42.245 --> 02:43.997
I'm alerting security
at Novoa headquarters.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.331
- It won't take too long, sir.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.457
- No, you'll stay here.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.751
Jax!

02:49.669 --> 02:50.587
[knock at door]

02:50.670 --> 02:52.505
- Come in.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.843
- Jax is here.
Is it okay for him to come in?

02:56.926 --> 02:57.969
- Sure, Dad.

02:58.052 --> 02:59.304
Hi, Jax.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.805
- Don't be too long.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.307
I want you to watch
this documentary

03:02.390 --> 03:03.725
on the history
of the adding machine.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.603
Oh, you're gonna love it.
It's so fascinating.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.645
- Mm, sounds like it.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.939
- What's up?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.733
- I think Jessie's
really my sister.

03:11.816 --> 03:12.775
- You do?
What happened?

03:12.859 --> 03:14.986
- My dad...

03:15.069 --> 03:16.529
he recognized her straightaway,

03:16.613 --> 03:18.072
and I've never seen him
so happy about something

03:18.156 --> 03:18.990
that isn't business related.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.533
- I'm not surprised.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.369
Girl's got a lot of 'tude
for a ten-year-old...

03:23.453 --> 03:25.413
which makes sense
why you're related.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.043
- But something really
weird is going on.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.961
He said that he's been looking
for her everywhere,

03:32.045 --> 03:32.837
but as soon as I started
asking questions,

03:32.921 --> 03:35.506
he cast a spell and shut me up.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.133
- Where could she have been
all these years?

03:37.216 --> 03:38.927
And why was it such
a big secret?

03:39.010 --> 03:40.595
MR. ALONSO:
Jax, come quick!

03:40.678 --> 03:42.305
They're introducing
the paper roll!

03:42.388 --> 03:45.600
- I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.226
Duty calls.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.561
Paper rolls?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.104
Can you pause that for me?

03:51.147 --> 03:53.107
[door closes]

03:53.942 --> 03:54.692
I don't know, Em.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.319
Something seems really sketchy

03:56.402 --> 03:58.154
about that story.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.323
- Yeah, but what?

04:00.406 --> 04:01.991
- Well, come on, Em.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.494
Do I always have to be the one
doing the heavy lifting here?

04:04.577 --> 04:05.620
And this one
isn't even that heavy.

04:05.703 --> 04:08.206
This is like lightweight
feather lifting--

04:08.289 --> 04:09.165
- Andi!

04:09.248 --> 04:10.583
Focus.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.543
- Em, do you really think
Jake Novoa

04:12.627 --> 04:13.962
misplaced his daughter?

04:14.045 --> 04:17.048
He's one of the most powerful
wizards in the Realm.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.094
Look, either he had
her hidden away,

04:21.177 --> 04:22.387
or somebody took her.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.012
- Who would take her?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.306
- I don't know.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.849
Business enemies,

04:26.933 --> 04:27.850
a clan of trolls,

04:27.934 --> 04:30.144
more Kanays,

04:30.228 --> 04:33.231
a very angry pack
of werewolves from Siberia.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.233
And that would explain
her personality.

04:38.069 --> 04:41.531
- [gasps]
Panthers.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.366
- Good morning,
Liberator of the Council

04:43.449 --> 04:44.867
and Savior of the Chosen One.

04:44.951 --> 04:48.037
- Aw, Sophie, you don't
have to call me that...

04:48.121 --> 04:50.289
unless you really want to.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.416
Did you do the questions?

04:51.499 --> 04:52.458
- Yes, but it wasn't easy.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.626
Emma didn't give me

04:53.710 --> 04:54.961
that much information
about Daniel.

04:55.044 --> 04:56.254
- Purple?

04:56.337 --> 04:59.257
I'm pretty sure
I asked for pink.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.467
- You did, because I remember
Katie saying,

05:01.551 --> 05:03.261
"If she thinks I'm gonna go out
and buy pink cards just"--

05:03.344 --> 05:06.472
- Because she wants them...
- Ow!

05:06.556 --> 05:09.225
- Then she's absolutely right.

05:09.308 --> 05:13.521
But the stationery store
was out of pink.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.481
This was the closest.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.899
- Thank you.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.067
- Wait, what are those?

05:18.151 --> 05:19.944
- They're for the game show
we invented.

05:20.028 --> 05:23.990
- Yeah, it's called
"Spin, Remember, Win"!

05:24.073 --> 05:26.409
- Because there's gonna be
a wheel, and you spin it,

05:26.492 --> 05:29.162
and it goes click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

05:29.245 --> 05:31.039
Click, click.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.750
- It's a super-fun way
of drilling Daniel

05:33.833 --> 05:35.752
about his other life
until he remembers.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.462
[screaming in the distance]
- What's that?

05:37.545 --> 05:39.338
[screaming]

05:40.631 --> 05:42.091
- It's a T. rex!

05:42.175 --> 05:43.634

05:43.718 --> 05:45.386
- Watch the shoes!

- Crazy people

- Hey, Em.

06:04.697 --> 06:06.616
Maddie had
the worst idea ever.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.535
She wants us to bring Daniel
to her house after school.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.288
- For the game show?
I know.

06:12.371 --> 06:15.458
Katie was grilling me
for material for the questions.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.627
It's not the worst idea
in the world.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.628
- Seriously?

06:18.711 --> 06:19.545
A Maddie game show?

06:19.629 --> 06:22.840
- Yes.
We should at least try.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.634
It beats doing nothing.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.802
Hey, you.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.678
- Oh.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.640
- Oh, man,
you do not look good.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.557
What happened?

06:31.641 --> 06:32.642
Watching movies with Emma's dad

06:32.725 --> 06:33.684
give you nightmares?

06:33.768 --> 06:34.811
- One library--

06:34.894 --> 06:37.355
- Don't.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.148
Did you find out
any more about Jessie?

06:39.232 --> 06:40.650
- Or your dad--
you know, evil wizard supreme?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.819
- Are you trying to help?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.488
Okay, I'm just cranky because
I have to go to Maddie's

06:45.571 --> 06:47.323
after school for her game show.

06:47.406 --> 06:49.992
- We're both trying to help.
- Well, I don't need help.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.203
I'm sure my dad will tell me
everything I need to know.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.163
- [scoffs]
Really? He will?

06:54.247 --> 06:55.581
I mean, 'cause you said...

06:55.665 --> 06:57.166
Ow!

06:57.250 --> 06:58.960
Okay.

06:59.043 --> 07:01.754
- I'm sure there's a logical
explanation for all this.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.630
- Well, there better be...

07:02.713 --> 07:04.715
or there'll be Jax to pay.

07:05.925 --> 07:08.636
- Look, just show up
after school.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.263
Maybe we'll get lucky?

07:10.346 --> 07:12.014
- All right.
- Yay!

07:18.938 --> 07:20.690
- Mia!

07:25.528 --> 07:26.821
- I'm bringing you home.

- I miss you, Daniel.

07:30.449 --> 07:31.033
Come home.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.286
- I miss you, too, Mia.

Come, sit down.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.456
[sighs]

07:39.959 --> 07:41.669
I still can't get over you
being here.

07:41.752 --> 07:43.296
How did you get here?

07:43.379 --> 07:44.547
Do you want anything?

07:44.630 --> 07:46.716
Uh, the veggie burgers
are kind of not bad.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.217
- I'm good.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.052
I just...

07:50.136 --> 07:51.220
I don't know.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.931
I had a bad dream,
and it got me worried.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.058
You left so suddenly,
and you didn't explain

07:56.142 --> 07:57.518
why you had to come to Miami.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.813
So I figured you needed
