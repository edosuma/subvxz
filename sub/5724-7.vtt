00:06.943 --> 00:08.643
<i>Previously on</i> The Affair...

00:08.645 --> 00:10.278
We're here
from Marla Bay Real Estate.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.614
Scotty Lockhart,
he asked us to let him know

00:12.616 --> 00:14.682
what we thought we could
put it on the market for.

00:14.684 --> 00:16.518
This is my place.
It's not for sale.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.219
This is fucking bullshit.
Don't ever do that again.

00:18.221 --> 00:20.187
No, no, no. Listen to me, okay?
I've got something for us.

00:20.189 --> 00:22.424
You could invest
half of your profit in this

00:22.426 --> 00:24.358
and you would still be
doing great.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.693
You know what, Scotty?

00:25.695 --> 00:27.662
I need to go.
I'm late for work.

00:27.664 --> 00:30.531
Uh, you two know each other
or something?

00:30.533 --> 00:32.198
Mind if I sit here
for a drink?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.300
Sure.

00:33.302 --> 00:34.701
I'm not my brother.

00:34.703 --> 00:37.404
Just thought you should
know that.

00:37.406 --> 00:38.806
Okay.

00:38.808 --> 00:40.541
I read your book, Noah.

00:40.543 --> 00:43.043
I'm sex. I'm the reason
the word was invented.

00:43.045 --> 00:44.711
No marriage could
survive me?

00:44.713 --> 00:46.814
Before you judge, will you
please just read the whole book?

00:46.816 --> 00:48.849
We end up together.
It's a happy ending.

00:48.851 --> 00:51.051
Wasn't that the end that Harry
wants you to change?

00:51.053 --> 00:52.753
You fucked her, didn't you?

00:52.755 --> 00:54.488
This is the problem.
You're a goddamn narcissist.

00:54.490 --> 00:57.223
It's all about your pain,
your loss, your kid!

00:57.225 --> 00:59.059
Cole!

00:59.061 --> 01:00.994
I blew up my life
for you, Alison.

01:00.996 --> 01:03.096
I don't belong to you.
We're not living in your book.

01:03.098 --> 01:05.698
You can't control me.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.704
I'm pregnant.

01:11.706 --> 01:14.807
I got a lead recently
from a guy who claims to have

01:14.809 --> 01:17.477
a piece of evidence that could
blow this whole case wide open.

01:17.479 --> 01:19.545
Why doesn't he just
call the police?

01:19.547 --> 01:21.214
The police won't pay him.

Oh, thank you.

03:05.551 --> 03:07.651
Do you remember
<i>Endless Love</i> by Scott Spencer?

03:07.653 --> 03:09.252
Excuse me.

03:09.254 --> 03:11.754
- Very same tone.
- Thank you.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.590
Somewhere between pulp
and literature.

03:13.592 --> 03:15.257
Excuse me, I'm just trying
to get through, thank you.

03:15.259 --> 03:17.126
Much more attractive
in person, don't you think?

03:17.128 --> 03:19.395
Will you tell Noah
this is supposed to be my party?

03:19.397 --> 03:22.364
I will.

03:22.366 --> 03:25.301
Sorry.
Thank you.

03:31.074 --> 03:32.141
Hey.

03:32.143 --> 03:33.442
Oh.
I'm so sorry.

03:33.444 --> 03:35.978
There she is.
I thought I'd lost you.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.646
- Hi.
- She's always sort of around.

03:37.648 --> 03:39.448
We have our own
little community out there,

03:39.450 --> 03:40.649
so I'll introduce you.

03:40.651 --> 03:42.084
He's friendly
when he wants to be.

03:42.086 --> 03:43.819
- Yes.
- He's a little strange.

03:43.821 --> 03:45.821
- When he needs something.
- He's a little strange.

03:45.823 --> 03:48.324
You do your work,
you hope for the best.

03:48.326 --> 03:50.626
Oh, listen to him.
He's so modest.

03:50.628 --> 03:52.594
We were having dinner
with Philip Roth last night...

03:52.596 --> 03:54.295
he's my neighbor
in the country...

03:54.297 --> 03:56.698
and he was talking about
the press this book is getting.

03:56.700 --> 03:57.966
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:57.968 --> 03:59.935
In fact, it was
all he could talk about.

03:59.937 --> 04:01.870
Philip likes to play
the mad genius

04:01.872 --> 04:04.472
at his little farm in Warren,
but I mean, all he cares about...

04:04.474 --> 04:07.442
all any author cares about...
is a rave in the <i>Times.</i>

04:07.444 --> 04:08.610
So here's to you.

04:08.612 --> 04:09.845
Thanks.

04:13.683 --> 04:16.983
What do you think
of Noah's masterpiece?

04:16.986 --> 04:18.786
Uh, I...

04:18.788 --> 04:19.987
She hasn't read it.

04:19.988 --> 04:21.188
Oh, you're kidding.

04:21.190 --> 04:22.389
Well, he has
enough critics.

04:23.826 --> 04:26.326
What is it you do, Alison?

04:26.328 --> 04:29.997
Um, at the moment,
just this.

04:29.999 --> 04:32.466
Alison used to be a nurse,
but she's taking time off.

04:32.468 --> 04:36.503
Nurse, yeah.
Is that your first?

04:36.505 --> 04:38.605
No.

04:38.607 --> 04:40.641
Noah, need you.
Excuse us.

04:40.643 --> 04:42.276
Oh, please don't
steal him, Eden.

04:42.278 --> 04:44.011
Someone more important
wants to talk to him.

04:44.013 --> 04:45.812
You publicists,

04:45.814 --> 04:47.381
you're everything that's wrong
with the industry.

04:47.383 --> 04:48.982
- I'll be back.
- No, we really have to go.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.185
Just give me five minutes
with him, I'm begging you.

04:51.187 --> 04:52.619
Uh... yeah, sure.

04:52.621 --> 04:54.888
Thanks.

05:02.997 --> 05:04.731
You doing all right,
sweetheart?

05:04.733 --> 05:07.201
Oh.
I'm fine, thanks.

05:07.203 --> 05:09.002
Those heels are
significant.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.037
Oh, they were
a big mistake.

05:11.039 --> 05:13.606
I usually wear flats.

05:13.608 --> 05:15.541
I'm Cynthia.

05:15.543 --> 05:17.243
Alison.

05:17.245 --> 05:18.945
How do you know this crew,
Alison?

05:18.947 --> 05:21.614
Uh, I'm with Noah Solloway.

05:21.616 --> 05:23.116
You must be his wife.

05:23.118 --> 05:24.918
Fiancée.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.954
I thought... in the book jacket
it says he lives in Brooklyn

05:27.956 --> 05:29.455
with his wife
and four children.

05:29.457 --> 05:31.190
Ugh, yeah,
that's a mistake.

05:31.192 --> 05:33.058
The publisher pulled the bio
from his first book

05:33.060 --> 05:34.594
without checking with him.

05:34.596 --> 05:37.162
Oh.
How awful for you.

05:37.164 --> 05:39.064
Well, no, it's okay.
It's getting corrected

05:39.066 --> 05:40.266
in the next printing,
so...

05:41.536 --> 05:43.102
Congratulations
on the second printing.

05:43.104 --> 05:44.937
That's wonderful news.

05:44.939 --> 05:47.039
Oh, thank you.

05:47.041 --> 05:49.375
Although I had nothing to do
with it. It's...

05:49.377 --> 05:53.778
I'm sure you had quite a bit
to do with it.

05:53.780 --> 05:56.381
When's the baby due?

05:56.383 --> 05:58.350
Uh, April.

05:58.352 --> 06:02.320
I'm sorry to be nosy,
but...

06:02.322 --> 06:04.789
Is Noah even divorced?

06:04.791 --> 06:07.058
Uh, almost.

06:07.060 --> 06:08.627
Really, Cynthia?

06:08.629 --> 06:10.928
Just cocktail chatter,
Eden.

06:10.930 --> 06:13.865
Alison, need you.
Excuse us.

06:16.235 --> 06:17.501
That was getting weird.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.838
That was Cynthia Rainer.
Ring any bells?

06:20.840 --> 06:24.575
Page Six.
She's a gossip columnist.

06:24.577 --> 06:26.310
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah, exactly.

06:26.312 --> 06:27.645
Listen, please don't talk
with anyone else

06:27.647 --> 06:30.581
without clearing it
with me first, okay?

06:52.437 --> 06:54.438
Do you mind if I sit here
for a while?

06:54.440 --> 06:55.439
Of course not.

06:55.441 --> 06:56.640
Thank you.

06:56.642 --> 06:58.008
You okay?

06:58.010 --> 07:00.277
Yeah, I'm just
a little tired.

07:00.279 --> 07:04.181
Oh.
Let me get you some more water.

07:04.183 --> 07:07.717
Thank you.

07:07.719 --> 07:12.722
And stay in here
as long as you'd like.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.391
That's a pretty intense scene
out there.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.328
Yeah, it is.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.668
Can I ask you
a question?

07:25.670 --> 07:27.971
Have you read a book
called <i>Descent?</i>

07:27.973 --> 07:30.173
I have two jobs
and a kid at home,

07:30.175 --> 07:33.309
so there's no time to read.
Why?

07:33.311 --> 07:36.245
Oh, no reason.

07:42.185 --> 07:43.986
Ready?

07:43.988 --> 07:45.822
I think I can get them
to squeeze us onto the 6:30.

07:45.824 --> 07:48.491
Look, we have to go.
Athena's showing up any minute.

07:48.493 --> 07:49.826
I still have to pick up
the turkey.

07:49.828 --> 07:51.361
My flight tomorrow
has been canceled.

07:51.363 --> 07:53.696
Big nor'easter.
We need to get him out tonight.

07:53.698 --> 07:55.631
Tonight is
Thanksgiving.

07:55.633 --> 07:57.132
I can't do anything
about that.

07:57.134 --> 07:59.034
- Give us a moment, will you?
- Of course.

07:59.036 --> 08:00.469
I need to call my contact
at Virgin.

08:00.471 --> 08:01.536
Thanks.

08:01.538 --> 08:02.738
I hate her.

08:02.740 --> 08:04.573
She's just doing her job.

08:04.575 --> 08:06.475
You can't leave tonight.
Everyone is coming over.

08:06.477 --> 08:07.809
I know, just look...
okay,

08:07.811 --> 08:09.411
give me 20 more minutes
here, okay?

08:09.413 --> 08:12.081
No, we've got so much to do.
Come on, Noah.

08:12.083 --> 08:13.782
I know.
You go and meet your mom.

08:13.784 --> 08:17.386
I'll be right behind you,
and I'll pick up the turkey.

08:17.388 --> 08:18.921
Come on, this is work for me,
Alison.

08:18.923 --> 08:20.756
I know it doesn't look like it,
but it is.

08:20.758 --> 08:22.591
This room is filled with people
who can make or break my book,

08:22.593 --> 08:26.294
so please, just understand
how important this is to me...

08:26.296 --> 08:27.929
to us.

08:27.931 --> 08:29.964
Franzen's here.
He'd like a word.

08:29.966 --> 08:31.400
Jonathan Franzen?

08:31.402 --> 08:33.534
No, Pericles Franzen.
Yes, Jonathan, come on.

08:33.537 --> 08:35.068
No, we were
just leaving.

08:35.071 --> 08:38.072
I'll be right behind you.
I swear.

08:41.476 --> 08:42.876
Fine.

08:42.879 --> 08:45.813
Thank you.

08:50.652 --> 08:52.052
Oh, sorry.

08:52.054 --> 08:54.221
No, no, no, you don't
owe me an apology.

08:54.223 --> 08:57.291
I know you're in overwhelm.
This boy, however,

08:57.293 --> 08:59.860
seems to be saving his sorrys
for someone else.

08:59.862 --> 09:01.929
It's our policy not to allow
entry to visitors

09:01.931 --> 09:03.330
without prior instruction.

09:03.332 --> 09:04.832
It's fine, Bradley.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.800
I told him
I was your mother.

09:06.802 --> 09:08.302
Yeah.

09:08.304 --> 09:09.803
We have a few more guests.
Just send them up.

09:09.805 --> 09:12.272
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

09:12.274 --> 09:15.309
Wait, how long do you think
you're staying?

09:15.311 --> 09:19.046
Do me a favor,
don't look so terrified.

09:19.048 --> 09:20.447
- Here.
- I got it.

09:20.449 --> 09:21.681
- I got it, I got it, I got it.
- Okay!

09:21.683 --> 09:22.615
God.

09:25.719 --> 09:30.257
Oh, my God.

09:30.259 --> 09:32.291
How much does this cost?

09:32.293 --> 09:34.293
Not a polite question,
Athena.

09:35.964 --> 09:38.164
Please, tell me
how much this costs.

09:38.166 --> 09:39.766
No.

09:39.768 --> 09:44.103
Whoo!
Is this suede?

09:44.105 --> 09:46.305
This is suede.
Mmm.

09:46.307 --> 09:48.174
Nice.

09:48.176 --> 09:49.809
You want a tour?

09:49.811 --> 09:51.478
Are you charging
for tours?

09:51.480 --> 09:52.478
No.

09:52.480 --> 09:54.212
Maybe you should be.

09:54.214 --> 09:58.484
So this is the boys' room.
We respect their privacy.

09:58.486 --> 09:59.818
Right.

09:59.820 --> 10:02.754
How is that all going
with his kids?

10:02.756 --> 10:05.190
Oh, the young ones are okay,
they like me,

10:05.192 --> 10:07.125
but the older ones...
trickier.

10:07.127 --> 10:08.426
Right.

10:08.428 --> 10:09.628
And this is for Stacey.

10:09.630 --> 10:11.096
Oh, cute.

10:11.098 --> 10:14.666
And Whitney, if she ever
decides to stay with us.

10:14.668 --> 10:16.034
She's the oldest one,
right,

10:16.036 --> 10:18.670
the one who had that thing
with Scott?

10:18.672 --> 10:20.372
Yeah.
That's her.

10:20.374 --> 10:23.308
Hmm. She is never gonna
stay in this room.

10:23.310 --> 10:26.944
No, I know.

10:26.946 --> 10:28.613
But Noah doesn't.

10:28.615 --> 10:30.948
I want to see
the nursery.

10:30.950 --> 10:35.019
Uh... it's this way.

10:42.794 --> 10:45.262
I'm confused.

10:45.264 --> 10:47.765
Noah's using this room
as an office,

10:47.767 --> 10:49.199
just until the baby comes.

10:49.201 --> 10:51.268
Ah, until the baby comes.

10:51.270 --> 10:52.469
Yes, that's right.

10:52.471 --> 10:54.270
You are aware
that it's customary

10:54.272 --> 10:55.471
to prepare a space
for the baby

10:55.473 --> 10:58.207
before it actually arrives,
right?

10:58.209 --> 11:01.878
Yes.
I'm well aware.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.814
- Okay.
- Come on, let's cook.

11:08.252 --> 11:12.055
Oh, you brought it.
I was sure you'd forget.

11:12.057 --> 11:13.590
Is that nice?

11:13.592 --> 11:15.725
Wait, can I see it?

11:15.727 --> 11:19.562
Oh, my God.

11:19.564 --> 11:22.197
Oh.
Wow.

11:22.199 --> 11:25.333
Oh, my God,
look at this.

11:26.837 --> 11:28.437
Whew.
Okay,

11:28.439 --> 11:30.839
I'm gonna start here.
What about you?

11:30.841 --> 11:32.942
Pies,
they take the longest.

11:32.944 --> 11:34.944
Okay, I think I got
everything you wanted.

11:34.946 --> 11:38.246
Just check the fridge.

11:38.248 --> 11:42.651
Fridge, fridge.

11:42.653 --> 11:44.586
Ah, Fri...
the fridge.

11:44.588 --> 11:47.755
Wow.

11:47.757 --> 11:49.356
Where's the turkey?

11:49.358 --> 11:51.059
Oh, Noah's picking it up
on his way home.

11:51.061 --> 11:52.526
He's what?

11:52.528 --> 11:54.929
Yeah, we ordered it
from Dean and Deluca.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.530
Cooked?

11:56.532 --> 11:57.899
That's right.

11:57.901 --> 12:00.367
You ordered a cooked turkey
for Thanksgiving?

12:00.369 --> 12:01.836
Don't judge me,
Athena.

12:01.838 --> 12:03.437
I'm not,
of course I'm not.

12:03.439 --> 12:05.239
I'm just trying to wrap my head
around the concept.

12:06.609 --> 12:09.343
Stop talking, start cooking,
okay?

12:21.723 --> 12:23.757
Are you sure
you don't want any?

12:23.759 --> 12:25.159
I'm pregnant.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.394
I drank an occasional glass
with you.

12:27.396 --> 12:29.296
I don't want to know.

12:29.298 --> 12:32.432
Oh, nothing happened.
You're fine.

12:32.434 --> 12:35.935
Did he take any money
from his ex-wife?

12:35.937 --> 12:37.170
No.

12:37.172 --> 12:39.839
Then exactly how much
did his book make?

12:39.841 --> 12:41.274
Why is it so important
to you?

12:41.276 --> 12:43.743
I just want to make sure
he can afford all this.

12:43.745 --> 12:46.446
We'll be fine.

12:46.448 --> 12:50.150
You're not paying
for any of it, are you?

12:50.152 --> 12:52.418
Shouldn't I be?
I'm living here.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.388
But, sweetie, you don't
have any money.

12:55.390 --> 12:56.889
I have my house.

12:56.891 --> 13:00.292
Wha... wait.

13:00.294 --> 13:02.061
You are not selling
your grandparents' house.

13:02.063 --> 13:03.829
I'm living here now.
I'm done living there.

13:03.831 --> 13:07.133
You don't know that.
Is he asking you to do this?

13:07.135 --> 13:08.134
No.

13:08.136 --> 13:10.136
Then don't be an idiot.

13:10.138 --> 13:13.839
He's a famous author now.
He can afford to keep you.

13:13.841 --> 13:16.008
Five minutes ago, you said he
didn't have enough money, now...

13:16.010 --> 13:20.079
For this place, for this...
this crazy coffee maker.

13:20.081 --> 13:23.682
Athena, unlike you, I'm not
happy being a freeloader.

13:23.684 --> 13:26.318
Oh.
Jesus, Alison.

13:26.320 --> 13:29.388
How long are you gonna spend
seeing every single decision

13:29.390 --> 13:31.523
life offers you
as another opportunity

13:31.525 --> 13:33.625
to prove you're not me?

13:33.627 --> 13:35.627
That house is
your inheritance.

13:35.629 --> 13:37.329
Just please make dinner.
Please.

13:37.331 --> 13:40.165
It is the only thing you have
in the world that has any value.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.734
No, it's not.
I have him.

13:42.736 --> 13:44.803
He is valuable to me.

13:44.805 --> 13:47.172
We're having a child,
Athena.

13:47.174 --> 13:50.041
I don't expect you to understand
what all of this means to me.

13:50.043 --> 13:53.712
You spent your life bouncing
from one man to the next.

13:53.714 --> 13:57.949
You never had a home.

13:57.951 --> 14:01.152
I had a home once.
I gave it to you.

14:01.154 --> 14:06.024
Grandma gave it to me.
She didn't trust you with it.

14:06.026 --> 14:11.029
No.
I gave it to you.

14:11.031 --> 14:12.563
Or rather,
I asked your grandmother

14:12.565 --> 14:16.534
to bypass me in her will
when you were born.

14:16.536 --> 14:20.471
I made her do it.

14:20.473 --> 14:21.472
Really?

14:23.142 --> 14:26.611
I knew I wouldn't be able
to give you much else

14:26.613 --> 14:29.580
as a mother
in the way of security,

14:29.582 --> 14:32.717
so I gave you
what I could.

14:35.186 --> 14:37.855
I know you hate
the choices I've made,

14:37.857 --> 14:40.591
and I can't say
I blame you,

14:40.593 --> 14:44.194
but I protected you
the one way I knew how.

14:44.196 --> 14:47.631
Now it's your turn
to protect your baby.

14:50.101 --> 14:52.970
Let Noah worry about how to pay
for this apartment.

14:52.972 --> 14:56.706
He's the one who wanted this,
not you.

14:56.708 --> 14:59.376
Keep your grandparents' house.

14:59.378 --> 15:03.480
That way, if, God forbid,
this doesn't work out,

15:03.482 --> 15:06.416
you and your kid'll have
a place to go.

15:07.752 --> 15:10.420
We forgot wine glasses.

15:10.422 --> 15:11.488
Have you read his book?

15:11.490 --> 15:13.123
Not yet.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.257
Why not?

15:14.259 --> 15:15.457
I'm... I'm not ready to, okay?

15:15.459 --> 15:17.359
Just promise me
you'll read it

15:17.361 --> 15:19.195
before you make any decisions
about the house.

15:19.197 --> 15:21.964
Look, it's too late,
Athena.

15:21.966 --> 15:26.435
The house is in escrow.
It's done.

15:35.512 --> 15:38.447
Gonna take a shower.

16:26.262 --> 16:27.729
Oh, my God.

16:27.731 --> 16:30.431
I can't believe I know
someone that lives here.

16:30.433 --> 16:32.166
I know, right?

16:32.168 --> 16:35.102
- Oh, I am so glad you came.
- Mmm.

16:41.076 --> 16:42.075
These are for you.

16:42.077 --> 16:45.812
Oh, thank you.
So sweet.

16:45.814 --> 16:46.913
Come in.

16:46.915 --> 16:49.549
Look at this fancy place!

16:49.551 --> 16:51.518
And your fucking belly.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.687
It's been what,
a year since I've seen you?

16:53.689 --> 16:55.989
Just about.
Take a seat.

16:55.991 --> 17:00.026
Well, you got a lot done.

17:00.028 --> 17:02.396
Yeah, I know.

17:02.398 --> 17:04.329
Oh, what about you?
What's going on?

17:04.332 --> 17:05.431
Catch me up.

17:05.433 --> 17:08.768
Well, I finished school.

17:08.770 --> 17:09.968
Oh, amazing.

17:09.970 --> 17:11.837
Yup.
Yeah, so now I'm just another

17:11.839 --> 17:14.406
unemployed visual artist
trying to eat in the city.

17:15.976 --> 17:19.144
So tell me
about this sugar daddy.

17:19.146 --> 17:22.647
I-I don't know him that well.
He's Noah's best friend.

17:22.650 --> 17:23.883
Hot?

17:23.885 --> 17:26.652
Yeah,
and he's very rich.

17:26.654 --> 17:28.119
Sold.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.991
But we might have to get you
a little drunk

17:32.993 --> 17:34.092
before you meet him.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.228
Why?
What, is he ugly?

17:36.230 --> 17:38.297
No, no, no, no, no,
he's very cute.

17:38.299 --> 17:40.899
He's just...

17:40.901 --> 17:43.735
he's kind of obnoxious.

17:43.737 --> 17:45.770
Is he racist?

17:45.772 --> 17:47.639
Uh, no, I don't think so.

17:47.641 --> 17:49.041
A Republican?

17:49.043 --> 17:50.742
I have no idea.

17:50.744 --> 17:53.745
Okay, if he's not racist
or Republican, I'll be okay.

17:53.747 --> 17:54.746
Okay.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.416
Oh, my God.

17:57.418 --> 17:59.918
I know.

17:59.920 --> 18:00.986
What are we drinking?

18:00.988 --> 18:02.454
I know.
Martini?

18:02.456 --> 18:03.455
Okay.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.456
Yes, please.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.524
So?
What about you?

18:06.526 --> 18:07.792
Me?

18:07.794 --> 18:09.160
Yeah.

18:09.162 --> 18:11.529
How you feeling
about all this?

18:11.531 --> 18:15.633
Oh, um, really well,
I-I think.

18:15.635 --> 18:17.802
You think?

18:17.804 --> 18:20.037
Well, it's just been
really quick.

18:20.039 --> 18:21.973
You know, it...

18:21.975 --> 18:25.777
Well, have you been back
to Montauk since you left?

18:25.779 --> 18:28.713
No, I haven't.

18:37.490 --> 18:39.023
You know what, maybe Noah got
temporary amnesia

18:39.025 --> 18:40.458
and went back to his house
in Brooklyn.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.194
- Ha ha.
- Sorry, joke.

18:44.196 --> 18:45.561
She thought it was funny.

18:45.563 --> 18:47.530
Didn't you,
beautiful woman?

18:47.532 --> 18:49.065
Are you a Republican?

18:49.067 --> 18:50.367
I'm agnostic.

18:50.369 --> 18:53.003
Hmm.
Let's get married.

18:53.005 --> 18:57.173
Let's not get married.

18:57.175 --> 18:59.642
What should we do?
Should we just eat?

18:59.644 --> 19:01.444
Did you call him?

19:01.446 --> 19:03.046
He's not answering
his phone.

19:03.048 --> 19:06.016
Let's give him
another half an hour.

19:06.018 --> 19:09.885
I have an idea
how to kill some time.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.120
Jane!

19:11.122 --> 19:12.721
Darling...

19:12.723 --> 19:14.390
...bring your tongue
back into your own mouth.

19:14.392 --> 19:16.958
Follow me, please.
This is for ladies, come on.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.394
Where are we going?

19:23.366 --> 19:25.300
Ohh.

19:28.872 --> 19:33.642
Oh, that is magic.
That is really just magic.

19:35.545 --> 19:38.379
My turn.
Don't hog it.

19:47.290 --> 19:49.957
Wow.

19:49.959 --> 19:53.394
It's your baby, Alison.

19:53.396 --> 19:54.395
Let me listen.

19:54.397 --> 19:57.331
Yeah.

20:11.546 --> 20:13.346
I-I can't hear anything.
I...

20:13.348 --> 20:14.347
Shh, shh, shh.

20:14.349 --> 20:15.348
I...

20:15.350 --> 20:18.285
Close your eyes.

20:21.021 --> 20:23.957
Good.

20:27.462 --> 20:28.795
- Wait, there it is.
- Good.

20:28.797 --> 20:30.797
Stop, stop.

20:36.169 --> 20:39.105
Remember,
there are two of you now.

20:42.076 --> 20:43.843
Why's everybody in here?

20:43.845 --> 20:46.245
We're just listening
to your child's heartbeat.

20:46.247 --> 20:47.847
Oh.

20:47.849 --> 20:49.415
You're really late.

20:49.417 --> 20:51.350
My fault,
totally my fault.

20:51.352 --> 20:52.719
Ah, Eden.

20:52.721 --> 20:54.553
Franzen took Noah to drinks.

20:54.555 --> 20:58.757
Oh, God, I kept trying to leave,
and he just monologues.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.126
What are you doing here? You...

21:00.128 --> 21:01.460
She has nowhere else to go.

21:01.462 --> 21:02.761
Noah!

21:02.763 --> 21:04.430
That's not how
we spin this.

21:04.432 --> 21:05.631
Have I taught you
nothing?

21:05.633 --> 21:08.267
Wha...
where's the turkey?

21:08.269 --> 21:09.668
Oh, fuck!

21:09.670 --> 21:10.936
You're kidding.

21:10.938 --> 21:12.104
Shit, I knew we forgot
something.

21:12.106 --> 21:13.772
I'll go get it
right now.

21:13.774 --> 21:15.073
- No, it's closed.
- I'm sure it's not.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.976
Yes, they are.
They close at 6:00.

21:17.978 --> 21:18.977
Oh, fuck.

21:18.979 --> 21:21.913
You had plenty of time.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.519
This is totally my fault.

21:32.491 --> 21:37.262
Noah, do you want to listen
to your baby's heartbeat?

21:37.264 --> 21:39.531
Of course, yeah.
Yeah.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.873
- Where is it?
- Right here.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.524
Gets me every time.

22:13.481 --> 22:16.283
Wait, what do you mean?
She's not here.

22:16.285 --> 22:19.286
She said what?

22:19.288 --> 22:22.556
Oh, God, Helen,
she just played us both.

22:24.192 --> 22:26.160
Dear, we're at the table
now, so...

22:26.162 --> 22:27.494
And everything looks
so yummy.

22:27.496 --> 22:29.063
Okay, just calm down.
Don't panic.

22:29.065 --> 22:30.564
I'm sure she's out with a friend
or something.

22:30.566 --> 22:33.032
I'll... of course,
as soon as I hear anything.

22:33.034 --> 22:36.470
Can I say hello
to the other kids?

22:36.472 --> 22:39.873
Hey, buddy, happy Thanksgiving.
I know, I'm sad too, you know?

22:39.875 --> 22:41.241
Ahh.
Okay.

22:41.243 --> 22:44.578
So, Athena and I, we made

22:44.580 --> 22:48.815
all this from my grandmother's
cookbook.

22:48.817 --> 22:51.985
It was first published
in 1927.

22:51.987 --> 22:53.152
Right, right, '27.

22:53.154 --> 22:55.489
That's amazing.
Thank you, guys.

22:55.491 --> 22:56.990
Oh, you're so welcome.

22:56.992 --> 22:58.658
That is amazing, thank you.

22:58.660 --> 23:00.360
And thank you for having us.
Like to...

23:00.362 --> 23:01.762
let me propose a little toast.
Can I?

23:01.764 --> 23:03.263
We should wait for Noah,
don't you think?

23:03.265 --> 23:04.630
Where did he go?

23:04.632 --> 23:06.565
Oh, he's just on the phone
with his kids.

23:06.567 --> 23:07.934
You know,
if I know Helen at all,

23:07.936 --> 23:09.568
she's gonna do
everything in her power

23:09.570 --> 23:10.703
to keep him on the phone
for the rest of the night,

23:10.705 --> 23:13.806
so... toast.
Yeah?

23:13.808 --> 23:16.376
To, um, new friends

23:16.378 --> 23:19.312
and old men
that I've known for...

23:19.314 --> 23:20.880
I can get us out
on the 11th,

23:20.882 --> 23:22.916
but they can only do business,
not first, is that okay?

23:22.918 --> 23:23.917
- Great.
- Okay, we need to leave

23:23.919 --> 23:25.451
no later than 9:00.

23:25.453 --> 23:27.353
Eden, sweetheart, I'm trying
to make a toast here.

23:27.355 --> 23:28.354
Yes.

23:28.356 --> 23:29.355
Oh, what are we
drinking to?

23:29.357 --> 23:31.457
To you, man,
to your success,

23:31.459 --> 23:34.427
and to the radiant woman sitting
across the table from you,

23:34.429 --> 23:37.095
because if she hadn't
come along,

23:37.097 --> 23:39.031
you'd still be
the same broke, unhappy,

23:39.033 --> 23:43.068
unsuccessful Park Slope dad
living off your wife's parents.

23:43.070 --> 23:46.871
Look at you now,
and it's all because of her.

23:46.873 --> 23:50.976
Yeah, so, it's really nice
to see you happy,

23:50.978 --> 23:53.111
Noah Solloway;
it's been a long time.

23:53.113 --> 23:54.446
- Thanks, Max.
- Yeah.

23:54.448 --> 23:56.014
Cheers.

23:56.016 --> 23:58.350
You know, I would like
to toast as well.

23:58.352 --> 23:59.784
Can't we just eat,
please?

23:59.786 --> 24:04.423
To Noah, for opening himself up
to his abundance.

24:04.425 --> 24:05.690
Thank you.

24:05.692 --> 24:07.624
May he make himself
worthy of it.

24:07.626 --> 24:09.660
Okay, I think
that's enough toasting.

24:10.997 --> 24:12.330
Mm.

24:12.332 --> 24:14.265
- Okay.
- Here.

24:14.267 --> 24:15.299
You want some green beans?

24:15.301 --> 24:17.001
Yeah.
All right, buddy.

24:17.003 --> 24:18.602
- Here.
- Nice.

24:18.604 --> 24:19.603
Athena, potatoes?

24:19.605 --> 24:21.339
Yes, yes.

24:21.341 --> 24:24.308
- Yes, potatoes.
- Oh, that's deep.

24:24.310 --> 24:25.609
Holy shit.

24:25.611 --> 24:26.877
What's wrong?

24:26.879 --> 24:27.845
Alison?

24:27.847 --> 24:29.113
Yeah.

24:29.115 --> 24:30.414
Do you recall
your conversation

24:30.416 --> 24:31.615
with Cynthia Rainer
this morning?

24:31.617 --> 24:33.750
Uh, yes.

24:33.752 --> 24:35.919
You made
quite the impression.

24:35.921 --> 24:38.421
"Hot author steps out
with pregnant fiancée.

24:38.423 --> 24:41.257
One hitch,
he's still hitched."

24:41.259 --> 24:42.459
It's on the <i>Post</i> website.

24:42.461 --> 24:44.027
Oh, fuck.

24:44.029 --> 24:47.030
Shit, uh...

24:47.032 --> 24:49.800
God, well, I-I... she was
so nice to me at the party,

24:49.802 --> 24:51.635
I didn't know who she was.
I'm sorry.

24:51.637 --> 24:53.336
That's okay.
Can we do anything about it?

24:53.338 --> 24:55.205
Can we get 'em
to take it down?

24:55.207 --> 24:58.141
It's been live for 15 minutes
and it's already got...

24:58.143 --> 25:01.578
150 comments and...

25:01.580 --> 25:02.646
twice as many shares.

25:02.648 --> 25:04.247
- Shit.
- No.

25:04.249 --> 25:07.150
No, this is good.
This is really, really good.

25:07.152 --> 25:08.652
How?

25:08.654 --> 25:10.420
Starting tomorrow,
you need to align yourself

25:10.422 --> 25:13.089
as much as possible
with the story of <i>Descent.</i>

25:13.091 --> 25:14.924
I-I'm talking
the whole sordid history,

25:14.926 --> 25:17.760
how you were both married
to other people when you met,

25:17.762 --> 25:19.262
and she's a waitress

25:19.264 --> 25:20.696
with the abusive husband,
the whole 9 yards.

25:20.698 --> 25:21.931
Sorry, excuse me?
What?

25:21.933 --> 25:24.434
People are
going to eat this up.

25:24.436 --> 25:26.602
Reviews are great,
but they don't sell books.

25:26.604 --> 25:30.440
Personalities sell books,
and thanks to Alison here,

25:30.442 --> 25:32.442
you finally have
a personality.

25:37.581 --> 25:41.484
Noah, you're not really...

25:41.486 --> 25:44.087
considering this, are you?

25:44.089 --> 25:47.189
I-I don't know.

25:47.191 --> 25:48.524
Noah.

25:48.526 --> 25:49.858
Look, can we talk
about this later?

25:49.860 --> 25:52.027
No, I want to talk
about this now.

25:52.029 --> 25:53.695
You said the book
is fiction.

25:53.697 --> 25:56.598
Of course it is,
but it's based on true events.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.732
Have you read the book?

25:57.734 --> 25:59.101
She's read parts of it.

25:59.103 --> 26:02.571
No, I-I've read the whole thing.
No, I...

26:02.573 --> 26:04.839
You have?
I thought you said you didn't...

26:04.841 --> 26:08.277
No, I've read
the whole fucking thing.

26:08.279 --> 26:10.479
So you're gonna say
this book is true.

26:10.481 --> 26:12.214
I mean, that's insane.

26:12.216 --> 26:13.715
That's not me.

26:13.717 --> 26:15.317
You make it seem
like I came onto you,

26:15.319 --> 26:18.087
like I practically
threw myself at you.

26:18.089 --> 26:19.154
- Didn't you?
- No.

26:19.156 --> 26:20.556
He threw himself at me.

26:20.558 --> 26:22.391
He basically, what,
followed me home one night

26:22.393 --> 26:24.759
and watched me having sex
with my husband.

26:24.761 --> 26:26.494
Which you did
for my benefit.

26:26.496 --> 26:27.762
What?

26:27.764 --> 26:29.297
I didn't even know
you were there!

26:29.299 --> 26:30.765
And then you make it out
that I'm

26:30.767 --> 26:32.067
some kind of coldhearted,
drug-dealing psychopath.

26:32.069 --> 26:33.501
Okay, calm down,
Alison, please.

26:33.503 --> 26:36.270
No, nothing is sacred
to you, nothing.

26:36.272 --> 26:38.607
I mean, you wrote
that I begged you

26:38.609 --> 26:41.209
to come to the hospital
when my grandmother was dying.

26:41.211 --> 26:42.644
- You did.
- No, I did not.

26:42.646 --> 26:43.712
You offered to help.

26:43.714 --> 26:46.047
Guys...
You know what...

26:46.049 --> 26:48.750
I think we're just having some
minor differences of opinion

26:48.752 --> 26:50.551
about some events
you both agree on.

26:50.553 --> 26:53.989
And then you killed me.

26:53.991 --> 26:57.492
You killed me
at the end of your book.

26:57.494 --> 26:59.060
Did that happen, Noah?

26:59.062 --> 27:02.363
Am I remembering
that part correctly?

27:13.942 --> 27:15.709
Hello?

27:15.711 --> 27:18.112
No, hi, yeah,
let me just step outside.

27:18.114 --> 27:21.282
If you'll excuse me.
Hi.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.148
Hey.

27:39.150 --> 27:42.819
Go away.

27:54.298 --> 27:57.166
Look, I know you're hurt,
and you have every reason to be,

27:57.168 --> 27:59.669
but...

28:02.674 --> 28:06.676
Harry made me
write that ending.

28:06.678 --> 28:10.213
He wouldn't accept the book
until I changed it.

28:11.614 --> 28:15.051
Alison.

28:15.053 --> 28:18.921
Look, it's fiction,
of course it is.

28:18.923 --> 28:20.589
Eden's just trying
to help it sell,

28:20.591 --> 28:22.491
but... I mean, if that
makes you uncomfortable,

28:22.493 --> 28:26.062
then I won't say anything
about my real life

28:26.064 --> 28:27.663
in interviews.
I'll cancel the whole book tour

28:27.665 --> 28:28.998
if that makes you happy.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.901
No, I didn't say that.
I just...

28:31.903 --> 28:36.405
I just...

28:36.407 --> 28:38.540
Do you even want
this baby?

28:40.944 --> 28:43.945
Of course I do.

28:43.947 --> 28:46.714
Really?

28:46.716 --> 28:50.018
You want to be a family?
The three of us?

28:50.020 --> 28:51.019
- Yes.
- You sure?

28:51.021 --> 28:52.420
Yes.

28:52.422 --> 28:56.824
You don't want to run me over
with a car...

28:56.826 --> 29:00.728
so you can just make
all this go away and...

29:00.730 --> 29:04.499
The book, it's just a story,
it...

29:07.169 --> 29:10.872
This is real,
this.

29:13.842 --> 29:17.545
This is my real life.

29:39.968 --> 29:44.104
And you told Jeffries that you
left the wedding before Scotty.

29:44.106 --> 29:46.173
That's right.

29:46.175 --> 29:49.444
You didn't notice anything
strange about him that night?

29:49.446 --> 29:52.447
No.
We barely spoke.

29:52.449 --> 29:55.349
I see.
Would you say that you were

29:55.351 --> 29:58.819
on good terms with him
at the time of his death?

29:58.821 --> 30:00.487
Yeah.

30:00.489 --> 30:02.556
I mean, he wasn't thrilled
about what happened

30:02.558 --> 30:07.260
with the lobster roll, but
that was between him and Cole.

30:07.262 --> 30:08.962
We were fine.

30:08.964 --> 30:13.399
Well, if that's all in keeping
with what you told Jeffries,

30:13.401 --> 30:16.336
that's good.

30:19.273 --> 30:21.174
Will I have to testify?

30:21.176 --> 30:23.944
I will only call you...
if I call you at all...

30:23.946 --> 30:26.880
as a character witness
for Noah.

30:35.813 --> 30:39.458
_

31:05.418 --> 31:06.785
<i>Te amo.</i>

31:11.290 --> 31:14.226
What did you say?

31:15.294 --> 31:18.230
Nothing.

31:21.668 --> 31:23.602
Hey.

31:39.217 --> 31:40.985
Hey.

31:40.987 --> 31:43.922
What's going on?

31:59.538 --> 32:01.972
What just happened?

32:01.974 --> 32:04.908
It's nothing.

32:26.230 --> 32:29.165
Be careful.
It's hot.

32:46.117 --> 32:47.617
Happy Thanksgiving.

32:52.355 --> 32:56.291
Hey, um...
I wanted to ask you...

32:56.293 --> 32:58.260
and you can tell me
if it's too soon...

32:58.262 --> 33:01.029
but I was wondering
if you wanted to come

33:01.031 --> 33:03.298
to Queens tonight.

33:06.269 --> 33:08.770
You know I don't like
the city.

33:08.772 --> 33:11.773
That's because you haven't been
to my part of the city.

33:14.044 --> 33:15.543
What part's that,
the barrio?

33:15.545 --> 33:18.479
The barrio, yeah.

33:21.284 --> 33:22.650
What's that?

33:22.652 --> 33:24.452
Come.
I've been here every weekend.

33:24.454 --> 33:26.020
It's your turn.

33:26.022 --> 33:27.955
And Margaret gave my mom
the day off,

33:27.957 --> 33:30.324
and I don't usually get
to spend time with her...

33:30.326 --> 33:33.361
I can't.
I have plans.

33:33.363 --> 33:35.329
What are you doing?

33:35.331 --> 33:38.098
It's Thanksgiving,
I'm gonna go...

33:38.100 --> 33:41.669
see my family,
go see my mom.

33:41.671 --> 33:45.939
Oh, I didn't know you were
back in touch with her.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.876
Well, you don't know
everything about me, do you?

33:51.546 --> 33:54.447
Yeah.

34:03.859 --> 34:07.661
Do you want to talk
about what happened in there?

34:07.663 --> 34:09.563
What do you mean?

34:09.565 --> 34:13.866
Well, I-I said, "I love you,"
and you lost your erection.

34:17.672 --> 34:19.972
Uh...

34:23.610 --> 34:25.378
Do you want muffins?

34:25.380 --> 34:26.545
Come on, Cole.

34:26.547 --> 34:28.348
I'm starving,
I'm starving.

34:28.350 --> 34:29.649
Just gonna run out
for a sec.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.585
Are you kidding me?

34:45.915 --> 34:49.083
Aw, dude,
I'm right behind you.

34:52.322 --> 34:54.723
That was a little rude,
don't you think?

34:54.725 --> 34:56.324
How you been, Scotty?

34:56.327 --> 34:57.926
Thanks.

34:57.928 --> 35:00.495
I heard she finally
sold the house.

35:00.497 --> 35:03.598
Yeah.

35:03.600 --> 35:08.303
She hasn't divorced you yet,
has she?

35:08.305 --> 35:13.108
Look, man, I know that things
haven't been exactly good

35:13.110 --> 35:15.443
between us, but I'm just
looking out for you here.

35:15.445 --> 35:17.879
I don't want her
to fuck you over again.

35:17.881 --> 35:20.147
That's nice of you,
Scotty.

35:20.149 --> 35:23.818
All this time I thought you were
just after the money.

35:23.820 --> 35:25.653
Actually,
now that you mention it.

35:25.655 --> 35:28.589
Check it out.

35:30.959 --> 35:31.992
What's that supposed to be?

35:31.994 --> 35:33.561
It's our logo, man.

35:33.563 --> 35:34.562
I want to call the place
Lockharts,

35:34.564 --> 35:36.531
you know, lock, heart.

35:36.533 --> 35:37.532
What place?

35:37.534 --> 35:39.166
Our nightclub, man.

35:39.168 --> 35:42.803
This goes on the napkins,
the glasses, everything.

35:44.772 --> 35:47.107
Hey, look, you're...

35:47.109 --> 35:49.676
you're coming to Thanksgiving,
right?

35:49.678 --> 35:52.346
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

35:52.348 --> 35:54.114
Cole, come on, man.

35:54.116 --> 35:55.883
You haven't spoken to Mom
in what, like, six months?

35:55.885 --> 35:57.651
Just... just come.
Surprise her,

35:57.653 --> 35:59.553
bring her some flowers.
Just...

35:59.555 --> 36:01.788
the cold war has gone on
for long enough.

36:01.790 --> 36:04.859
Scotty,
nobody wants me there.

36:04.861 --> 36:07.594
I want you there.

36:13.668 --> 36:16.035
I can't.
I promised Luisa

36:16.037 --> 36:18.805
I'd go into the city,
spend it with her family.

36:19.940 --> 36:22.041
That's cool.
They... they...

36:22.043 --> 36:24.544
they celebrate
Thanksgiving?

36:24.546 --> 36:27.180
Look, Cole, I-I hate to be
the one to tell you this,

36:27.182 --> 36:31.283
but she's just using you
for a green card.

36:31.285 --> 36:33.185
She tried to pull
the same shit with me.

36:33.187 --> 36:36.355
Oh!
What's up, rock stars?

36:36.357 --> 36:38.591
Well, if it isn't
Montauk's fucking finest.

36:38.593 --> 36:40.926
Ahh!
Come on, now, Scotty.

36:40.928 --> 36:42.661
Don't you think we should
all choose our words

36:42.663 --> 36:44.930
a little more carefully
now that we're celebrities?

36:44.932 --> 36:48.834
Right?

36:48.836 --> 36:51.270
Oh, don't tell me
you haven't read it.

36:51.272 --> 36:52.504
Haven't read what?

36:52.506 --> 36:55.007
Solloway's book.

36:55.009 --> 36:56.441
Why would we?

36:56.443 --> 36:59.411
'Cause you're
fucking all over it.

36:59.413 --> 37:02.080
Drugs,
the moonshine,

37:02.082 --> 37:05.150
he even put in the stuff about
the feud between our families.

37:05.152 --> 37:07.652
He used me as a source.

37:07.654 --> 37:09.121
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:09.123 --> 37:12.690
I am not, Scott.
I gave him gold,

37:12.692 --> 37:14.759
dramatic gold.

37:14.761 --> 37:15.927
When they make the movie,
I told them

37:15.929 --> 37:18.463
I want to play myself.

37:18.465 --> 37:21.265
Oh, Scott,
one more thing.

37:21.267 --> 37:23.902
I heard you been sniffing
around The Lobster Roll.

37:23.904 --> 37:26.571
Yeah, you may want
to read that book.

37:26.573 --> 37:29.607
I don't know where your capital
is coming from these days,

37:29.609 --> 37:31.275
but I wouldn't want
a real estate attorney

37:31.277 --> 37:34.446
combing through my finances
right now if I were you.

37:34.448 --> 37:38.449
Just some advice.

38:08.480 --> 38:10.180
There's plenty of
hot water left if you want to...

38:10.182 --> 38:12.849
Why did you move this?

38:12.851 --> 38:16.353
Uh, I was just looking at it.
It's a beautiful picture.

38:38.642 --> 38:39.709
What are you doing?

38:39.711 --> 38:43.178
Nothing.

38:43.180 --> 38:47.682
Um...
I'm gonna go back to the city.

38:47.684 --> 38:49.918
Are you sure you don't
want to come with me?

38:49.920 --> 38:52.988
I already told you,
I'm having dinner with my mom.

38:52.990 --> 38:56.024
I don't believe you.

38:56.026 --> 38:58.960
I don't want you to be
alone today.

39:04.867 --> 39:08.202
Where's my money clip?

39:08.204 --> 39:09.770
What money clip?

39:09.772 --> 39:12.206
The money clip that was
right here when I left.

39:12.208 --> 39:13.641
I don't know,
maybe in your pants.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.410
No, I took some cash
before I left

39:15.412 --> 39:19.247
and I put the money clip
right there.

39:19.249 --> 39:21.315
Are you accusing me
of stealing?

39:21.317 --> 39:23.551
There was $150 in there!
Where is it?

39:23.553 --> 39:26.487
You need to apologize to me
right now, Cole.

39:31.560 --> 39:34.762
Where's my money?

39:34.764 --> 39:37.397
Go fuck yourself.

39:37.399 --> 39:40.333
I hope you
fucking rot here.

40:56.742 --> 40:58.108
Yeah, I'll grab
the turkey, Mom.

40:58.110 --> 40:59.477
Don't worry about it.

40:59.479 --> 41:01.979
Thank you.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.748
I heard
that you lost the baby.

41:04.750 --> 41:05.749
I'm sorry.

41:07.652 --> 41:09.018
We held a Mass for him.

41:09.020 --> 41:12.356
A month ago.

41:12.358 --> 41:15.291
I know you did.
And I'm sorry I wasn't there.

41:15.293 --> 41:17.728
I'm sure you had
very important things to do.

41:17.730 --> 41:19.863
Hey, he's here now.

41:19.865 --> 41:21.698
Maybe a little forgiveness,
a little gratitude?

41:21.700 --> 41:25.001
What day is today?
Hmm?

41:25.003 --> 41:26.570
Let's pray.

41:29.006 --> 41:30.374
Our Father...

41:30.376 --> 41:33.676
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

41:33.678 --> 41:36.211
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

41:36.213 --> 41:37.880
on earth
as it is in heaven.

41:37.882 --> 41:39.882
Sorry.

41:39.884 --> 41:42.518
Give us this day
our daily bread,

41:42.520 --> 41:44.487
forgive us
those trespasses

41:44.489 --> 41:47.556
as we forgive those who have
trespassed against us,

41:47.558 --> 41:49.625
and lead us
not into temptation.

41:49.627 --> 41:52.561
But deliver us from evil.
Amen.

41:52.563 --> 41:54.497
All right, dig in.

41:54.499 --> 41:56.131
What was that about?

41:56.133 --> 42:00.068
Somebody's gotta
take care of this family.

42:00.070 --> 42:01.970
Okay, who's up first?

42:01.972 --> 42:04.272
Caleb, not this year.

42:04.274 --> 42:06.374
Hey, come on, who are we
without our tradition?

42:06.376 --> 42:07.709
Listen to Mom, Caleb.

42:07.711 --> 42:09.076
What are you talking about?

42:09.078 --> 42:11.413
Come on, we do this
every year, right?

42:11.415 --> 42:15.216
Right? And this year we have
something to celebrate.

42:15.218 --> 42:19.387
Cole's home.
To our brother.

42:21.089 --> 42:25.560
Oh, Jesus Christ.
That's like lighter fluid.

42:25.562 --> 42:27.295
How much more of this stuff
you got left?

42:27.297 --> 42:28.530
Just one case.

42:28.532 --> 42:30.264
Okay, you hear that,
everyone?

42:30.266 --> 42:32.400
Grandpa Silas's moonshine
is almost gone.

42:32.402 --> 42:33.902
Mary Kate, here.

42:33.904 --> 42:35.235
Leave her alone.

42:35.237 --> 42:38.171
Come on.

42:39.908 --> 42:43.209
I am grateful for you,
Cherry,

42:43.211 --> 42:45.646
for helping me
through all of this.

42:45.648 --> 42:49.015
Hear, hear.

42:49.017 --> 42:50.216
Ooh.

42:50.218 --> 42:51.685
Ooh is right, I know.

42:51.687 --> 42:53.086
Hal, you go.

42:53.088 --> 42:56.122
Yeah, I'll go.
I'm...

42:56.124 --> 42:58.058
I'm grateful for Dad.

42:58.060 --> 43:00.093
- For Dad?
- Yeah, you know,

43:00.095 --> 43:03.096
being our father and
bringing us into this world.

43:05.433 --> 43:08.367
I got one.

43:10.604 --> 43:11.971
- To Noah Solloway...
- Cole.

43:11.973 --> 43:14.707
...for writing his book,

43:14.709 --> 43:18.644
about Alison, about me,
and about all of you.

43:23.750 --> 43:25.585
Mmm.

43:25.587 --> 43:26.853
Anybody read it?

43:26.855 --> 43:29.154
- No.
- Oh, you should,

43:29.156 --> 43:31.524
'cause we are all over it.

43:31.526 --> 43:34.293
He calls us the Rineharts
and makes us out to be

43:34.295 --> 43:36.596
some kind of
lowlife drug dealers.

43:36.598 --> 43:38.464
- Wait a minute, what?
- Just be... just relax,

43:38.466 --> 43:39.799
it's a novel.
It's fiction.

43:39.801 --> 43:41.300
For your sake
I hope it is,

43:41.302 --> 43:42.368
since you're the only one
left dealing.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.269
Shut your mouth, Cole.

43:44.271 --> 43:46.605
You're right,

43:46.607 --> 43:48.874
that's what I should do, 'cause
that's what we're good at.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.609
I should shut my mouth.

43:50.611 --> 43:52.611
I mean, there can be
a shit storm raining down on us

43:52.613 --> 43:55.314
and we just turn the other way
and pray it's all right,

43:55.316 --> 43:57.149
but I'll tell you, he makes
a pretty compelling case

43:57.151 --> 44:00.119
that this is in our blood 'cause
Grandpa Silas was a bootlegger.

44:00.121 --> 44:01.820
- How'd he know that?
- So you know what?

44:01.822 --> 44:03.688
Here's to Silas.

44:03.690 --> 44:04.856
Okay, that's it, you're done.
Okay, I'm putting this away.

44:04.858 --> 44:06.358
No, no, you know what?

44:06.360 --> 44:07.726
How about this?
You want to hear some of it?

44:07.728 --> 44:08.827
It's good.
You should hear this.

44:08.829 --> 44:10.095
- No!
- Did you read it?

44:10.097 --> 44:11.729
I wanna read it.

44:11.731 --> 44:13.564
Some interesting things
about our family in here.

44:13.566 --> 44:16.434
Go ahead.

44:16.436 --> 44:19.770
- Leave us alone.
- Hold on, hold on.

44:19.772 --> 44:24.075
Where is it?
There we go.

44:24.077 --> 44:25.876
"The brothers kept
the summer people

44:25.878 --> 44:27.345
high on cocaine,

44:27.347 --> 44:30.181
a glamorous drug
for the glamorous set.

44:30.183 --> 44:32.417
They disdained their clientele
as if they were

44:32.419 --> 44:35.719
somehow above them,
keepers of old Montauk,

44:35.721 --> 44:38.189
knights of a forgotten
round table,

44:38.191 --> 44:39.757
but they were delusional.

44:39.759 --> 44:42.092
There was no nobility
in their blood.

44:42.094 --> 44:44.694
These common boys were
and always would be,

44:44.696 --> 44:46.829
like their murderous
grandfather, bootleggers."

44:46.831 --> 44:48.432
Oh, my God.
"Murderous"?

44:48.434 --> 44:50.700
- Oh, it gets better.
- That's enough.

44:50.702 --> 44:53.537
You don't want to hear
about our feud with the Hodges?

44:53.539 --> 44:55.705
'Cause apparently,
we started it.

44:55.707 --> 44:57.407
I mean, all these years,
we thought Thomas Hodges

44:57.409 --> 44:59.042
burned Silas's land,
but apparently,

44:59.044 --> 45:01.078
arson isn't interesting enough
for Solloway,

45:01.080 --> 45:04.047
so he turned our grandfather
into a baby-killer.

45:04.049 --> 45:05.648
- What? Oh, my God.
- Yes.

45:05.650 --> 45:07.484
Look, I've tried
to understand this man...

45:07.486 --> 45:09.719
I swear to God I have,
and I have even tried

45:09.721 --> 45:13.557
to forgive him lately,
but he is a parasite.

45:13.559 --> 45:16.059
He's a leech!
He knows exactly

45:16.061 --> 45:17.394
what this family
has been through

45:17.396 --> 45:19.428
and he took our story
and twisted it

45:19.430 --> 45:21.230
into something grotesque!

45:21.232 --> 45:24.166
I mean, what kind of mind
does that?

45:27.471 --> 45:30.439
Why do you two keep
looking at each other?

45:33.743 --> 45:36.778
Tell him, Mom.

45:36.780 --> 45:38.647
Because it's true.

45:42.919 --> 45:45.921
The baby's name
was Eamon.

45:45.923 --> 45:47.756
Okay.

45:47.758 --> 45:50.692
Ma, what are you
talking about?

45:53.497 --> 45:58.500
Your grandfather Silas was
a terrible person, boys.

45:58.502 --> 46:00.768
He was a drunk
who beat his wife.

46:00.770 --> 46:03.204
He beat your dad.

46:03.206 --> 46:07.308
And your grandmother had
an affair with Thomas Hodges,

46:07.310 --> 46:09.944
and she got pregnant,

46:09.946 --> 46:14.949
and when Silas found out
that the baby wasn't his,

46:14.951 --> 46:17.318
he drowned it.

46:17.320 --> 46:21.489
That's why Hodges torched
Silas's land, Cole,

46:21.491 --> 46:23.691
revenge.

46:23.693 --> 46:26.894
If this is true, why... why...
Why didn't we know about it?

46:26.896 --> 46:30.331
Because your father
didn't want you to know.

46:30.333 --> 46:33.701
He... he...

46:33.703 --> 46:36.737
he worried it would do to you
what it did to him.

46:38.006 --> 46:39.740
What it did to him?

46:39.742 --> 46:42.442
You don't recover from
that kind of childhood, Cole.

46:42.444 --> 46:44.278
Oh, so that's what it was?

46:44.280 --> 46:47.347
Dad had a rough childhood;
that's what was wrong with him?

46:47.349 --> 46:49.283
Not the fact that he was
a stumble-down drunk?

46:49.285 --> 46:51.118
You don't know what
you're talking about.

46:51.120 --> 46:53.387
You're right, I'm having
a hard time following this.

46:53.389 --> 46:55.389
Our father didn't want
anybody to know

46:55.391 --> 46:58.726
this deep, dark family secret,
so nobody did except for you,

46:58.728 --> 47:00.061
the most clearheaded member
of our family?

47:00.063 --> 47:04.699
Jesus Christ, Cole.
Mom just told me, okay?

47:04.701 --> 47:06.533
Because she's worried
about you.

47:06.535 --> 47:08.735
Well, thank you for your
concern, Mother, but I'm fine.

47:08.737 --> 47:11.071
It's you who've gone
off the deep end.

47:11.073 --> 47:13.106
Why should we believe
anything that you say?

47:13.108 --> 47:14.808
You have lied to us.

47:14.810 --> 47:17.411
She told you you were
sitting on millions,

47:17.413 --> 47:18.912
and the whole time,
our inheritance,

47:18.914 --> 47:20.780
our land was
already gone!

47:20.782 --> 47:23.517
Everything that I did
was to protect you,

47:23.519 --> 47:25.118
from the day
you were born.

47:25.120 --> 47:26.553
Is that what you
tell yourself?

47:26.555 --> 47:30.123
Our family is cursed,
Cole.

47:30.125 --> 47:31.225
What did you say?

47:31.227 --> 47:32.726
I remember Cora,
before she died,

47:32.728 --> 47:34.027
she was trying to tell me.

47:34.029 --> 47:35.962
This happens in families

47:35.964 --> 47:38.532
when something so evil
has occurred.

47:38.534 --> 47:41.468
The sins of the father are
visited upon the children,

47:41.470 --> 47:42.969
and now it's
the grandchildren.

47:42.971 --> 47:43.970
Stop this.

47:43.972 --> 47:46.439
First, your sweet Gabriel.

47:46.441 --> 47:48.775
Then Scotty's baby
with the Solloway girl.

47:48.777 --> 47:51.277
Now it's Hal
and Mary Kate.

47:51.279 --> 47:53.847
Don't you see
what's happening?

47:53.849 --> 47:55.782
There will never be
another Lockhart.

47:55.784 --> 47:57.416
I said stop talking.

47:57.418 --> 48:00.053
Your father loved you
so much,

48:00.055 --> 48:03.022
and he tried so hard to get
through what happened to him,

48:03.024 --> 48:06.492
and in the end,
he couldn't do it.

48:06.494 --> 48:09.362
But let me tell you something.

48:09.364 --> 48:10.797
You think you're
better than him?

48:10.799 --> 48:11.965
You think you're
different than him?

48:11.967 --> 48:14.367
You're not.

48:14.369 --> 48:16.936
The last time I saw
a man as bad off as you,

48:16.938 --> 48:18.704
he hung himself.

48:37.191 --> 48:39.091
Cole.

48:39.093 --> 48:40.259
Leave me alone, Scott.

48:40.261 --> 48:41.960
Just... just come back inside,
will ya?

48:41.962 --> 48:44.296
She's gone crazy,
and you're enabling her.

48:44.298 --> 48:45.963
That is why we need you,
okay?

48:45.965 --> 48:49.200
We need you to come back and be
a part of this family again,

48:49.202 --> 48:52.304
and we... we need
your fucking money, okay?

48:52.306 --> 48:54.472
So that we can invest
in something real

48:54.474 --> 48:56.608
and move forward, okay,
because if we don't,

48:56.610 --> 48:59.811
if we stay here, it <i>will</i> be
the end of the Lockharts!

48:59.813 --> 49:02.714
<i>You</i> are the <i>only</i> one
who has the ability

49:02.716 --> 49:03.848
to change everything!

49:03.850 --> 49:05.149
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

49:05.151 --> 49:07.151
Scotty?

49:07.153 --> 49:09.688
- What?
- Scotty, can I talk to you?

49:09.690 --> 49:11.189
Whitney?

49:11.191 --> 49:13.024
Hey, how... wait, wait,
how did you find me?

49:13.026 --> 49:14.826
You texted me, like,
ten minutes ago.

49:14.828 --> 49:15.893
That was... that was you?

49:15.895 --> 49:17.228
Jesus Christ, Scott!

49:17.230 --> 49:18.697
I didn't know
it was her, okay?

49:18.699 --> 49:20.198
How the fuck did you get
my phone number?

49:20.200 --> 49:21.666
Oh, please, ask anybody
who snorts blow in Montauk.

49:21.668 --> 49:23.099
- Oh, my God.
- Go... you have to go!

49:23.101 --> 49:24.335
No, please, I need to talk
to you for five minutes.

49:24.337 --> 49:26.002
No, no!
If the police show up,

49:26.004 --> 49:27.237
I go to fucking prison.
Do you not understand that?

49:27.239 --> 49:28.872
Five minutes,
give me five minutes.

49:28.874 --> 49:30.374
Get out of here, now.
Get out of here, I got this.

49:30.376 --> 49:31.908
- Stop, give me five...
- I'm sorry, you can't.

49:31.910 --> 49:33.243
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- You can't!

49:33.245 --> 49:34.712
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Oh!

49:34.714 --> 49:36.847
Stop it!
Don't touch...

49:36.849 --> 49:38.349
- Hey!
- Scotty!

49:38.351 --> 49:39.883
- Hey, don't... you can't.
- Scotty! Scotty!

49:39.885 --> 49:42.753
- You can't.
- Don't fucking touch me!

49:42.755 --> 49:45.288
Okay.

49:57.269 --> 50:00.202
God!

50:05.209 --> 50:08.043
Your parents out here
with you?

50:08.045 --> 50:10.980
No, I took the train.

50:13.384 --> 50:18.220
Where are you supposed to be
right now?

50:18.222 --> 50:21.858
I don't fucking know.

50:25.929 --> 50:28.865
Oh.

50:33.103 --> 50:36.472
Come on, I'll give you a ride
back into the city.

50:50.520 --> 50:53.889
Do you remember that time
you tried to kill me?

50:53.891 --> 50:55.757
What?

50:55.759 --> 50:57.826
You pointed a gun
at my head.

50:57.828 --> 50:59.561
I think I was pointing it
at your father.

50:59.563 --> 51:02.731
Well, I remember you
pointing it at my head.

51:05.937 --> 51:08.304
I'm sorry you
had to see that.

51:08.306 --> 51:11.206
Really.

51:15.278 --> 51:17.746
Look...

51:17.748 --> 51:19.949
You gotta stop
coming after Scotty.

51:19.951 --> 51:22.051
You have to leave him
alone.

51:22.053 --> 51:24.486
He got me pregnant.

51:24.488 --> 51:27.656
I know he did.

51:27.658 --> 51:31.259
I really care about him.

51:31.261 --> 51:34.195
Okay.

51:38.634 --> 51:41.570
I think he really cares
about me.

51:43.405 --> 51:44.773
He doesn't.

51:44.775 --> 51:46.407
Why not?

51:46.409 --> 51:49.978
'Cause that's just not
the way it works.

51:49.980 --> 51:51.546
Just because
you love somebody

51:51.548 --> 51:55.149
does not mean they
have to love you back.

51:55.151 --> 51:58.086
I'm sorry.

52:00.222 --> 52:01.690
And, look, I'm sure
you don't want

52:01.692 --> 52:02.891
to spend the rest
of your life chasing

52:02.893 --> 52:05.694
after my idiot brother,
right?

52:05.696 --> 52:08.630
I mean, you must have
bigger plans than that.

52:16.438 --> 52:19.474
Do you know my dad
wrote a book?

52:19.476 --> 52:21.042
Yeah, I heard.

52:21.044 --> 52:22.043
You're in it.

52:22.045 --> 52:23.344
I know.

52:23.346 --> 52:27.848
I'm not.

52:27.850 --> 52:31.352
You know, maybe that was
just his way of protecting you.

52:31.354 --> 52:33.888
Or maybe I'm just not
as important to him

52:33.890 --> 52:36.824
as I thought I was.

52:52.607 --> 52:54.975
My father hung himself
on my tenth birthday.

52:59.148 --> 53:00.614
Which I used to think
just meant

53:00.616 --> 53:02.950
that he didn't give a shit
about me,

53:02.952 --> 53:07.188
or anybody else
for that matter.

53:07.190 --> 53:10.124
But now...

53:14.795 --> 53:17.730
I don't know,
I think...

53:22.437 --> 53:25.338
I think maybe he was
just drowning.

53:46.461 --> 53:48.595
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is going on?

53:48.597 --> 53:52.532
I came here instead of Mom's.
Don't make me regret it.

53:59.373 --> 54:02.275
She came looking
for Scotty.

54:02.277 --> 54:03.476
I thought it'd be better
for everybody

54:03.478 --> 54:07.146
if I got her
out of Montauk.

54:07.148 --> 54:10.149
I don't know what that kid
is trying to prove.

54:10.151 --> 54:13.452
She thinks she's in love.

54:17.191 --> 54:21.327
You want to come in
for a drink?

54:21.329 --> 54:22.328
No.

54:22.330 --> 54:24.030
Good.

54:52.593 --> 54:55.528
Hi.

55:00.367 --> 55:04.803
This is for you.

55:04.805 --> 55:08.207
I want to apologize
for this morning.

55:08.209 --> 55:09.975
What you said to me
was unforgivable.

55:09.977 --> 55:12.511
Yeah.

55:12.513 --> 55:15.781
Yeah, I come from a long line
of unforgivable men.

55:22.755 --> 55:25.691
I think that I got used
to being alone.

55:29.696 --> 55:32.864
It's been a while since
I've had someone I cared about,

55:32.866 --> 55:34.599
so I wanted to come here
and apologize to you

55:34.601 --> 55:37.969
because I behaved
like an asshole

55:37.971 --> 55:40.739
and I know that.

55:40.741 --> 55:42.640
And I did it on purpose.

55:42.642 --> 55:44.576
I was trying to hurt you,
I was trying to get you

55:44.578 --> 55:47.512
out of my house, and as soon
as you walked out that door,

55:47.514 --> 55:50.916
I wanted you back.

55:50.918 --> 55:53.018
So...

55:53.020 --> 55:54.652
Look, I can't promise you
I'm going to be

55:54.654 --> 55:56.221
the best thing that ever
happens to you,

55:56.223 --> 55:58.724
but I promise you I will never
hurt you like that again,

55:58.726 --> 56:02.293
and I am good for my word,
Luisa.

56:02.295 --> 56:04.229
You can ask anyone.

56:04.231 --> 56:08.833
I may not be good for much,
but I am good for my word.

56:19.911 --> 56:21.145
Okay.

56:24.716 --> 56:27.651
There's one other thing.

56:31.456 --> 56:33.323
<i>Te amo tambien.</i>

56:50.407 --> 56:53.342
Come in.
You must be starving.

56:57.481 --> 56:59.115
Welcome.

56:59.117 --> 57:01.050
Hi.

57:01.052 --> 57:04.053
It's good to see you.

57:18.318 --> 57:21.019
That doesn't look
like good terms to me.

57:21.021 --> 57:23.088
No, it does not.

57:23.090 --> 57:25.958
I'd give my right nut
to know what he's saying.

57:25.960 --> 57:30.128
I can tell you.

57:30.130 --> 57:33.165
I was standing out back
not more than 20 feet away,

57:33.167 --> 57:35.967
smoking.

57:35.969 --> 57:38.535
And I believe that's what
you call in legal circles

57:38.537 --> 57:40.304
"proximity."

57:40.306 --> 57:42.173
So what's he saying?

57:42.175 --> 57:45.343
That's gonna cost you extra.

57:46.712 --> 57:48.812
You know what,
you can tell me now,

57:48.814 --> 57:50.914
or I'll subpoena your ass,
and then you can explain

57:50.916 --> 57:53.451
to the court why you hid
evidence from the police.

57:59.291 --> 58:03.193
"That's our baby."

58:03.195 --> 58:04.194
What?

58:06.263 --> 58:09.199
Hey, Bob,
rewind the tape.

58:14.639 --> 58:19.576
"That's our baby."
Heard it as plain as day.

58:31.722 --> 58:33.823
"That's our baby."
