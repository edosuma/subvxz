00:04.580 --> 00:06.246
Matty:
Find some treasure, boys.

00:06.398 --> 00:07.731
What a year this was.
We found treasure.

00:07.824 --> 00:09.416
-Spanish eight real, buddy.
-Come on!

00:09.568 --> 00:10.676
-Rick: Is it, really?
-Matty: Let's go!

00:10.827 --> 00:12.494
Rick:
It's the only authentic

00:12.588 --> 00:14.755
Pirate ship found in the world.

00:14.849 --> 00:16.423
Michael gattuso:
I'm actually getting
a signal here.

00:16.575 --> 00:18.517
Mel fisher was
looking for the<i> atocha.</i>

00:18.744 --> 00:19.852
-Wow.
-Melvin abt:
He received coins and chains and

00:20.079 --> 00:22.187
-Bars and emeralds.
-Marty: That's beautiful.

00:22.339 --> 00:24.339
Mike groleau:
You can actually see
what we think is a box.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.433
-I think it looks man-made.
-Matty: You think that's gold?

00:26.585 --> 00:28.919
-Tim fisher: Yeah, it's gold!
-No way! Aah!

00:29.012 --> 00:30.937
What you're looking at
is a section

00:31.090 --> 00:32.823
-Of a shipwreck.
-Oh, my god.
-Wow.

00:35.018 --> 00:36.702
All the while
we were growing up,

00:36.853 --> 00:39.872
My brother and I were fascinated
with finding treasure.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.023
Rick:
Pirate treasure,

00:42.043 --> 00:43.617
Cursed treasure.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.693
Civil war gold.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.455
-(laughter)
-since then,
our work on oak island

00:48.607 --> 00:50.774
Has shown us
there's a world of mysteries...

00:50.867 --> 00:53.777
-Whoa.
-...Waiting to be explored.

00:53.796 --> 00:56.630
Rick:
So, we like to reach out
to other treasure hunters.

00:56.782 --> 00:58.965
X marks the spot, right there.
Brilliant.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.226
-Marty: We want to hear
their stories...
-That's right.

01:01.453 --> 01:03.637
-...And share our insights.
-"ill-gotten gains."

01:03.789 --> 01:05.138
-Rick: And who knows...
-Gary: I got it.

01:05.291 --> 01:06.957
...Maybe we can help them
with their search.

01:07.050 --> 01:08.475
Marty:
Not only in america.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.385
Wow. That is gold.

01:10.479 --> 01:12.220
-Rick: But all over the world.
-Yeah!

01:23.733 --> 01:25.976
Matty: What a year this was.
I mean...

01:26.069 --> 01:28.087
It's really our third
time around,

01:28.238 --> 01:29.980
Looking at these
other mysteries

01:30.073 --> 01:31.757
Beyond oak island,
and I can tell you,

01:31.908 --> 01:35.819
This summer was a real
game changer for me personally,

01:35.912 --> 01:37.654
Professionally,
I learned so much.

01:37.673 --> 01:39.823
I got to be with both of you
on the road,

01:39.916 --> 01:41.341
Which is, like, my
favorite thing in the world,

01:41.435 --> 01:43.084
And I think we really

01:43.178 --> 01:45.938
Showed this year,
in particular,

01:46.089 --> 01:47.514
How it's done.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.441
How methodical you have to be.

01:49.668 --> 01:51.777
But along the way,
we definitely moved the needle

01:52.004 --> 01:53.928
On each of these
like never before, I think.

01:54.022 --> 01:56.097
I mean, we found treasure.

01:56.117 --> 01:59.118
Quintessential, good old
cliché gold and silver coins.

01:59.345 --> 02:01.678
But when we didn't,
even in those moments,

02:01.697 --> 02:03.122
We found corroborating
evidence each time

02:03.349 --> 02:04.531
That fit the story,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.458
Which is no guarantee.

02:06.610 --> 02:09.444
I think this year was awesome
for us, I really do.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.021
You know I often do
role reversal.

02:11.114 --> 02:12.873
I mean, I'm fixated on finding

02:12.967 --> 02:15.041
Some valuable treasure
here on oak island,

02:15.194 --> 02:17.469
But on these,
I'm as much into the story as,

02:17.621 --> 02:18.637
As he normally is.

02:19.715 --> 02:23.291
Everything we talk
about here: Persistence,

02:23.385 --> 02:26.370
The ability to deal
with adversity,

02:26.388 --> 02:29.055
The commitment,
the passion, the intellect,

02:29.150 --> 02:31.725
The-the application of
science and technology.

02:31.877 --> 02:33.894
Across the board,
it is very consistent

02:33.988 --> 02:35.395
With everyone we've met.

02:35.547 --> 02:36.655
I think that's correct.

02:36.806 --> 02:38.231
They set a goal,

02:38.384 --> 02:39.307
They believed
they could accomplish it--

02:39.401 --> 02:40.475
They had hoped they could--

02:40.569 --> 02:42.052
And they, and they went for it.

02:42.145 --> 02:44.554
They have the story
in their hand

02:44.648 --> 02:46.239
Before they start looking.
I mean,

02:46.392 --> 02:48.558
Mel fisher knew he was
looking for the<i> atocha.</i>

02:48.652 --> 02:50.818
What an incredible
journey that was.

Melvin:
Today's the day we're gonna
find some treasure,

03:00.514 --> 03:01.513
I'll tell you that much
right now.

Tim meade:

03:02.925 --> 03:04.408
Melvin:
We named this area emerald city.

03:04.501 --> 03:06.018
...Few have matched
the excitement

03:06.245 --> 03:08.503
Of the fisher family's
ongoing quest

03:08.522 --> 03:10.931
To salvage valuables
from the fabled wreck

03:11.025 --> 03:13.841
Of the<i> atocha</i> in the waters
near key west, florida.

03:13.936 --> 03:15.527
We're treasure hunting, fellas.

03:15.754 --> 03:17.362

Come on, baby,
bring me some green.

Narrator:
The 550-ton spanish galleon
known as

03:21.869 --> 03:23.760
The<i> nuestra señora de atocha</i>

03:23.779 --> 03:25.853
Was sunk and broken apart by

03:25.948 --> 03:29.041
A series of hurricanes in 1622,

03:29.268 --> 03:32.786
Leaving a precious cargo
of gold, silver,

03:32.938 --> 03:34.454
Emeralds, and artifacts

03:34.548 --> 03:37.607
Worth more than a billion
dollars in today's value

03:37.701 --> 03:40.126
Scattered
across a ten-mile debris field.

03:40.221 --> 03:44.389
The wreck remained lost for
more than four centuries until

03:44.616 --> 03:47.467
A midwestern chicken farmer
turned salvage diver

03:47.619 --> 03:51.730
Named mel fisher-- along with
his wife deo and their team--

03:51.957 --> 03:57.477
Found some $450 million
in treasure in 1973.

03:57.629 --> 04:01.907
Although mel fisher passed
away in 1998,

04:02.134 --> 04:05.393
His family-- including
his grandson melvin--

04:05.412 --> 04:07.320
Continue to recover
treasure and artifacts

04:07.414 --> 04:09.164
From the<i> atocha</i> every year.

04:13.236 --> 04:15.495
(men exclaiming)

Oh, that's cool.

Narrator: While helping
to salvage new finds with melvin

04:19.001 --> 04:21.927
During the spring of 2022...

04:22.078 --> 04:23.095
Marty:
Gold's incredible, isn't it?

04:23.322 --> 04:24.504
Matty: Look at that.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.989
It's more fun when you

04:26.008 --> 04:27.674
Dribble it into their hand,
like...

04:27.826 --> 04:29.342
Wow.

04:29.495 --> 04:31.103
Narrator:
...Rick, marty, and matty

04:31.330 --> 04:33.830
Also met with
melvin's mother taffi

04:33.849 --> 04:35.832
And his uncle kim

04:35.925 --> 04:37.350
To experience some
of the family's

04:37.503 --> 04:38.926
Greatest past discoveries

04:38.946 --> 04:41.671
At their treasure museum
and store in key west.

04:41.765 --> 04:43.765
Let me show you
some of the emeralds.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.117
Oh, fantastic.

04:46.361 --> 04:48.845
Matty:
Look at that, wow.

04:48.864 --> 04:50.196
That's amazing.

04:50.349 --> 04:52.032
Marty:
That's beautiful.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.959
Kim:
And the darker the green,

04:54.186 --> 04:55.961
-The more valuable the emerald.
-Matty: Oh, really?

04:56.112 --> 04:57.537
-Yeah.
-Marty: What the hell is
that one?

04:57.689 --> 04:59.189
$500,000, $600,000.

04:59.207 --> 05:00.857
-Whoa!
-Wow.

05:00.950 --> 05:01.708
-Move these away from me.
-(laughter)

05:01.860 --> 05:03.302
I don't want to hurt 'em.

05:03.529 --> 05:05.804
You know there was
a common denominator there

05:06.031 --> 05:08.473
On that<i> atocha</i> thing you and
I were on, though, rick.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.291
You know how, when the
hammer grab comes out here,

05:10.385 --> 05:12.869
Every time you're thinking,
"wow, I wonder what's in there."

05:12.888 --> 05:13.961
-You're eager to go look at it.
-This'll be it.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.647
Yeah, well, as that stuff was

05:15.799 --> 05:17.632
Coming across the screen
out there,

05:17.726 --> 05:19.467
That same feeling was there,

05:19.561 --> 05:20.544
-I'm sure you had it, too.
-Oh, sure.

05:20.562 --> 05:21.486
Will an emerald pop up,

05:21.638 --> 05:22.970
Will a silver coin pop up?

05:23.065 --> 05:25.215
-That's right.
-Hope arises,

05:25.233 --> 05:26.808
And the sort of
"today's the day" thing

05:26.827 --> 05:28.309
Was even happening to us
out there.

05:28.403 --> 05:29.903
-Absolutely.
-Today's the day

05:30.055 --> 05:31.721
That these emeralds
are going to pop up.

05:31.815 --> 05:33.723
Yeah, I was so honored
to get two cracks at it

05:33.817 --> 05:35.149
And go back with tony sampson.

05:35.243 --> 05:37.002
Melvin:
Let's put on our dive gear.

05:37.229 --> 05:38.670
Tim m.: Let's get the gear on,
let's go do this.

05:38.897 --> 05:40.914
-Let's make today the day.
-All: Today's the day!

05:41.066 --> 05:43.008
Narrator: Several weeks after
his trip with rick and marty,

05:43.235 --> 05:46.403
Matty returned to key west
with their friend,

05:46.496 --> 05:48.496
Professional diver
tony sampson...

05:48.590 --> 05:50.498
Matty:
Find some treasure, boys.

05:50.592 --> 05:52.742
...To once again assist
the fishers

05:52.836 --> 05:56.003
In their quest to find more
of the<i> atocha's</i> lost treasures.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.430
<i> Matty:</i>
<i> What do you got, fellas?</i>

05:57.524 --> 05:58.273
Over. What do you got?

06:00.527 --> 06:01.818
My heart's pounding right now.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.864
No way! Whoo!

06:06.091 --> 06:08.258
Well, of course, we've stayed
in touch with the fishers.

06:08.276 --> 06:10.276
They have an update, and
mel's actually standing by,

06:10.429 --> 06:11.444
-So...
-That's great.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.829
Let's see what they're up to.

06:13.949 --> 06:15.857
-Hello, mel.
-Mel.
-Hi, mel.

06:15.951 --> 06:17.859
<i> Hey, guys, how's it going?</i>

06:17.878 --> 06:19.044
-Good.
-We were wondering that

06:19.195 --> 06:20.361
About you, how's it going?

06:20.455 --> 06:22.196
<i> Very good, I'm enjoying</i>

06:22.290 --> 06:24.107
<i> My time here in sebastian</i>
<i> right now.</i>

06:24.200 --> 06:27.201
What's on the wish list
right now?

06:27.221 --> 06:28.536
Like, I know when we were there,

06:28.555 --> 06:30.463
We were looking for emeralds,

06:30.557 --> 06:32.282
And then we moved off that site
when tony and I came out,

06:32.300 --> 06:34.041
Looking for more kind of coins.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.786
Are you hot on the trail
of kind of a new area

06:36.805 --> 06:37.804
You think might make
new discoveries?

06:37.956 --> 06:38.955
<i> Yes, so,</i>

06:38.974 --> 06:41.048
The<i> magruder's</i> focus for the,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.735
The remainder of this season
is going to be

06:43.962 --> 06:46.405
Working the areas they've
been working, that gold line.

06:46.632 --> 06:49.557
<i> We want to continue</i>
<i> to excavate in that area</i>

06:49.576 --> 06:52.077
And recover
whatever artifacts are there.

06:52.304 --> 06:56.473
<i> As far as the new areas,</i>
<i> one of our other ships,</i>

06:56.566 --> 06:58.917
The<i> dare,</i>
a 90-foot salvage vessel,

06:59.144 --> 07:01.161
Is headed out to the northwest
area of the trail,

07:01.255 --> 07:03.663
<i> An area of virgin territory,</i>

07:03.757 --> 07:04.906
<i> And they're going to</i>
<i> be making excavations,</i>

07:05.000 --> 07:06.908
<i>Seeing what they can find there.</i>

07:06.927 --> 07:10.320
We do have a lot of very good
magnetometer targets

07:10.413 --> 07:13.247
<i> In this area,</i>
<i> so I'm hopeful that we will</i>

07:13.341 --> 07:15.158
Start finding coins in bunches.

07:15.177 --> 07:18.437
There's still an estimated
100,000 coins

07:18.664 --> 07:20.755
Between the<i> atocha</i> and
<i> santa margarita,</i>

07:20.849 --> 07:23.090
Roughly 60,000 alone
on the<i> atocha.</i>

07:23.185 --> 07:25.777
<i> And just to find one chest</i>

07:25.929 --> 07:27.279
Of 5,000 coins

07:27.506 --> 07:28.429
<i> Would really make me</i>
<i> very happy.</i>

07:28.523 --> 07:31.116
-(laughs)
-marty: Hey, mel,

07:31.267 --> 07:32.284
I see on the internet--
and I kind of

07:32.435 --> 07:33.935
Half-follow these things--

07:34.029 --> 07:35.695
That an emerald from the<i> atocha</i>

07:35.789 --> 07:37.605
Went for a really good price,

07:37.624 --> 07:39.699
An amazing price, at sotheby's

07:39.851 --> 07:41.293
Recently.

07:41.520 --> 07:45.205
And I also saw
that the money from that,

07:45.357 --> 07:47.615
Which is really heartwarming,
went to the people of ukraine.

07:47.709 --> 07:49.025
Is there more to that story?

07:49.118 --> 07:51.211
-Can you give us
some background?
<i> -Sure.</i>

07:51.363 --> 07:53.530
So, a while back we were
contacted by

07:53.623 --> 07:55.198
A pr firm that's working with

07:55.291 --> 07:59.961
Mitzi perdue, the widow
of chicken empire magnate

07:59.980 --> 08:01.705
Frank perdue.

08:01.798 --> 08:04.557
And frank was
a longtime investor

08:04.710 --> 08:06.318
In my grandfather's
expedition,

08:06.545 --> 08:09.154
<i> And he was all the way</i>
<i> through the mother lode</i>

08:09.305 --> 08:10.880
And then some.

08:10.899 --> 08:12.549
He received lots and lots
of treasure--

08:12.567 --> 08:16.143
Coins and chains
and bars and emeralds--

08:16.238 --> 08:18.646
<i> And one of these emeralds</i>

08:18.740 --> 08:22.483
He had turned into an engagement
ring for his wife mitzi perdue.

08:22.577 --> 08:25.319
And she has now
auctioned off that item,

08:25.413 --> 08:28.414
And, uh, cause for charity.

08:28.509 --> 08:31.176
That's a great round trip
for that emerald, isn't it?

08:31.403 --> 08:33.586
I mean, that's-that's
really nice, to be...

08:33.739 --> 08:35.663
So, the treasure
that your grandfather found

08:35.682 --> 08:37.498
Is now going to help
the people of ukraine.

08:37.518 --> 08:40.001
Absolutely,
and mel used to say, you know,

08:40.020 --> 08:41.669
We're just the custodians
of this,

08:41.688 --> 08:43.337
It belonged to somebody
before us

08:43.357 --> 08:45.749
And it's going to belong
to somebody after us.

08:45.842 --> 08:47.008
Funny, we hear that
all the time, too.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.693
Well, it's clearly true.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.603
<i> Well, there's a lot more</i>
<i> emeralds out there,</i>

08:50.756 --> 08:52.255
Ready to be brought up,

08:52.348 --> 08:54.591
And we have plenty
in stock, so...

08:54.609 --> 08:56.276
<i> If anybody else wants to</i>

08:56.370 --> 08:58.278
<i> Buy an emerald and donate it</i>

08:58.430 --> 09:01.114
<i> For another good cause,</i>
<i> you know who to contact.</i>

09:01.266 --> 09:03.433
I think maybe you got
your grandfather's

09:03.526 --> 09:05.118
-Sales ability, you know?
-(matty laughs)

09:05.212 --> 09:06.286
I think I can feel it

09:06.380 --> 09:08.288
Coming through the screen, okay?

09:08.440 --> 09:10.215
They call that
the fisher factor.

09:10.366 --> 09:11.941
(laughter)

09:12.035 --> 09:13.126
Yeah, I think
I just sensed it, yeah.

09:13.220 --> 09:16.388
Well, listen, on a similar note,

09:16.615 --> 09:20.041
Please say hi to your mother
and your uncle,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.710
Taffi and kim,
and, um, from all of us.

09:22.804 --> 09:24.454
We wish you the best of luck

09:24.547 --> 09:26.898
And hopefully
we can stay in contact.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.809
<i> I sure hope so, too,</i>
<i> and it means the world.</i>

09:29.961 --> 09:31.461
<i> Thank you guys</i>
<i> so much for having me,</i>

09:31.554 --> 09:34.130
It's really been
an awesome experience.

09:34.149 --> 09:36.223
Yeah, for us, too, and
if you find that sterncastle,

09:36.243 --> 09:37.909
-Give us a ring, will you?
-(all chuckling)

09:38.061 --> 09:39.744
You guys will be one
of my first calls.

09:39.896 --> 09:41.304
I got about 85 investors
ahead of you.

09:41.397 --> 09:42.822
-(all laughing)
-but I will call you.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.732
That's completely fair

09:44.751 --> 09:46.734
And the right priority.
Thanks a lot, mel.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.328
Rick:
Been a pleasure, thank you.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.504
-Melvin: Bye, guys.
-Matty: Thanks, mel.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.320
Rick: All the real treasure
stories that we've been on

09:57.339 --> 10:00.098
Or been lucky to hear of
or be a part of,

10:00.249 --> 10:03.343
It all has that same theme,
right?

10:03.495 --> 10:05.662
-Pretty much.
-Ill-gotten gains,

10:05.680 --> 10:08.255
Chased by the authorities,
a need to

10:08.275 --> 10:10.108
Safeguard it, and then

10:10.335 --> 10:12.426
-Leave and never come back.
-That's right.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.112
And that's the genesis of

10:14.263 --> 10:15.688
-Almost every treasure story.
-A lot of them.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.264
I was thinking,

10:17.284 --> 10:19.618
What we were looking for
this year varied.

10:19.769 --> 10:22.603
But there were a couple
direct searches for gold,

10:22.697 --> 10:24.438
Which is always exciting.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.625
And it was kind of fun to
kick things off, basically,

10:26.852 --> 10:28.868
With a search for gold,
with captain joe.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.703
Oh, yeah.

10:30.856 --> 10:32.188
That story was really
interesting because

10:32.207 --> 10:33.373
I had never heard of it.
Had you heard of

10:33.525 --> 10:34.799
-This guy before?
-No, no. Aury?

10:35.026 --> 10:36.693
-I certainly had not.
-Marty: Right,

10:36.711 --> 10:38.528
And that's really fun,
to learn these things,

10:38.546 --> 10:40.138
-This captain aury...
-Matty: Yeah.

10:40.365 --> 10:41.973
-...Who was quite a character.
-Matty: Yes.

10:43.126 --> 10:45.459
Marty:
This is captain joe's house.

10:45.479 --> 10:46.460
All right,
I think I see our crew.

10:46.554 --> 10:47.871
Yeah, there's our crew.

10:47.964 --> 10:49.706
Narrator:
When marty was contacted

10:49.724 --> 10:53.226
Early last year by joe zsiga--
a retired boat captain

10:53.378 --> 10:56.379
From tampa, florida--
and given the opportunity

10:56.398 --> 10:58.564
To help recover
more than a billion dollars

10:58.659 --> 11:00.808
In buried gold,

11:00.827 --> 11:04.237
It was an offer that he and
matty blake could not refuse.

11:04.389 --> 11:06.147
Michael:
The document that I have

11:06.166 --> 11:08.574
Tells a little story
about captain louis aury.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.059
Went to this well

11:10.153 --> 11:12.337
-To stash his treasure.
-Yeah.

11:12.488 --> 11:14.989
Narrator:
According to their research,

11:15.008 --> 11:18.492
Captain joe and
his friend michael gattuso

11:18.512 --> 11:20.253
Believe that the treasure
had been buried

11:20.405 --> 11:24.090
On a nearby beach in 1817
by captain louis aury.

11:24.242 --> 11:26.518
Originally from paris, France,

11:26.669 --> 11:28.669
Captain aury helped lead

11:28.689 --> 11:32.265
Numerous central american
revolutions against the spanish

11:32.359 --> 11:34.918
Before becoming one of
the most successful privateers

11:35.011 --> 11:38.421
In the early 19th century,
establishing

11:38.514 --> 11:40.773
A base of operations near
tampa, florida.

11:40.867 --> 11:45.019
However, when the united states
outlawed privateering,

11:45.113 --> 11:46.854
Aury was forced to flee--

11:46.948 --> 11:50.041
But not before reportedly

11:50.193 --> 11:51.617
Burying 11 separate caches
of gold

11:51.770 --> 11:53.878
On a beach near an ancient well.

11:54.030 --> 11:56.197
-You guys can start hammering
away.
-Matty: All right.

11:56.291 --> 11:59.609
Narrator:
After recruiting archaeologist
dr. Aaron taylor,

11:59.627 --> 12:02.445
Who secured a permit
for the search to proceed...

12:02.538 --> 12:05.281
Michael:
Right here, I'm actually
getting a signal right here.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.951
-(tapping)
-(matty exclaims)

12:07.969 --> 12:09.561
-Erin melcher: There it is.
-Do we have a well?

12:09.788 --> 12:11.378
Joe:
I think we have a well,
gentlemen.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.624
...Marty, along with matty,
helped joe and his team

12:14.642 --> 12:17.235
Locate the old well
and then obtain

12:17.386 --> 12:19.796
Metal detection readings
that indicated

12:19.814 --> 12:21.573
11 different caches of gold

12:21.724 --> 12:23.742
Were possibly buried
on the beach,

12:23.893 --> 12:25.893
-Just as joe believed.
-(beeping)

12:25.912 --> 12:27.470
Michael: There's
definitely something here.

12:27.489 --> 12:30.306
-Matty: Shall we begin?
-Marty: Yes.

12:30.399 --> 12:33.476
Narrator:
The team found several
promising clues and artifacts,

12:33.495 --> 12:36.479
Potentially dating to
the early 19th century.

12:36.498 --> 12:38.423
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

12:38.574 --> 12:41.150
-Whoa.
-I don't know what that is.

12:41.169 --> 12:42.427
Taylor:
Hey, you guys got something?

12:43.930 --> 12:45.488
(metal clinking)

12:45.581 --> 12:47.156
That doesn't look
naturally made.

12:47.175 --> 12:50.159
Feels like the bottom
of a pot or something?

12:50.178 --> 12:53.496
Aaron:
It's a chert; it's something
first nations would have used.

12:53.589 --> 12:57.108
Narrator:
However, like many treasure
hunters have experienced

12:57.260 --> 12:59.185
On oak island, each time

12:59.337 --> 13:02.447
The team's digs approached
the target depths,

13:02.598 --> 13:04.357
Ocean water rushed in,

13:04.509 --> 13:07.101
Thwarting the chances
for a major discovery.

13:07.195 --> 13:09.270
-You still believe
the treasure's here?
-Yes, I do.

13:09.364 --> 13:10.530
-You do?
-Yes, I do.

13:10.682 --> 13:12.015
There's just too much out there

13:12.108 --> 13:13.274
-That points to it.
-Yeah.

13:13.368 --> 13:14.775
If we were allowed to have

13:14.869 --> 13:16.443
A small backhoe in there,

13:16.463 --> 13:19.539
We would have got to that cache.

13:19.691 --> 13:21.448
I don't think this is the end

13:21.468 --> 13:22.859
Of captain joe zsiga.

13:22.877 --> 13:24.710
This is only the beginning.

13:24.863 --> 13:27.030
It will continue on.

13:27.123 --> 13:29.290
Matty:
It's, it's frustrating.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.550
Exciting, exhilarating,
but also frustrating, because

13:30.702 --> 13:32.126
We kept getting that gold hit.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.627
Yeah, well, there's
similarities, too,

13:33.647 --> 13:35.462
The sand and the
water were coming in.

13:35.557 --> 13:37.148
No flood tunnel this time,

13:37.300 --> 13:39.225
But, you know, come on,
we're digging right--

13:39.319 --> 13:41.544
-The beach was just,
like, right there.
-Right.

13:41.637 --> 13:43.304
And, um, so,
the water-- deeper we got,

13:43.323 --> 13:44.823
The more, you know,
sand sloughs in.

13:45.050 --> 13:48.401
Not only just us,
but dan and dunfield.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.721
I mean, dunfield lost
the big dig because of that.

13:51.814 --> 13:52.813
-Similar, yeah.
-The cave-in pit

13:52.833 --> 13:54.740
Was abandoned
because of that,

13:54.835 --> 13:56.984
The south shore pit was
abandoned because of that.

13:57.078 --> 13:58.503
And those were real clues.

13:58.730 --> 14:00.338
Those were-- presented
real opportunities

14:00.565 --> 14:03.232
To do what you were
trying to do.

14:03.251 --> 14:04.843
Locate something
to be retrieved.

14:05.070 --> 14:07.403
So, yes, it's happened here
many times.

14:07.422 --> 14:09.072
Yeah, you couldn't help
but think of oak island,

14:09.090 --> 14:10.164
Watching that sand
collapse in on itself

14:10.258 --> 14:11.908
When the water came up,

14:11.926 --> 14:13.518
As we're getting
gold signatures.

14:13.669 --> 14:14.427
Impossible not to
think of oak island.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.912
It was exciting.

14:16.005 --> 14:17.430
You know,
it would be nice to

14:17.582 --> 14:18.748
Pull out a, you know,
a nice little chest

14:18.841 --> 14:20.416
-Full of gold coins.
-(sputters)

14:20.435 --> 14:21.434
And he'd done his research,

14:21.586 --> 14:23.010
The story seemed plausible.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.362
-Matty: Mm-hmm.
-And then, of course,

14:24.513 --> 14:26.364
The thing you admire
so much, rick,

14:26.515 --> 14:28.700
About all the treasure hunters
is that

14:28.927 --> 14:30.517
You say to captain joe,
"are you done?"

14:30.537 --> 14:31.852
"hell no! No, no, no,

14:31.872 --> 14:33.779
I'm coming back,
I'm gonna get..."

14:33.874 --> 14:35.264
He's supposedly trying

14:35.358 --> 14:37.542
-To get different permits.
-Yes.

14:37.693 --> 14:39.193
He's trying to
research the title.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.362
He wants to get in there
with equipment.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.382
According to his own admission
when we talked to him last,

14:44.533 --> 14:47.276
It really validated him
with state archaeologists

14:47.295 --> 14:48.535
And the local authorities there

14:48.630 --> 14:50.963
To continue his search,

14:51.057 --> 14:53.707
Because he found something
of great educational

14:53.727 --> 14:55.560
And historical value in
that area, and that's awesome.

14:55.787 --> 14:57.378
And was done properly
'cause we furnished

14:57.472 --> 14:59.230
Dr. Taylor's expertise.

14:59.457 --> 15:01.215
Anyway, it was a
real interesting story and

15:01.234 --> 15:02.959
A real interesting hunt, and
it was fun, wasn't it, matty?

15:03.052 --> 15:04.402
-It was fun.
-It was really fun.

15:04.553 --> 15:05.978
It was fun to get a little dirty
and do some work.

15:06.131 --> 15:08.798
And then, speaking of gold hits,

15:08.891 --> 15:10.983
Then you went on an adventure

15:11.136 --> 15:13.136
-Without us.
-Without us.

15:13.154 --> 15:14.487
Yeah, but actually came up with

15:14.639 --> 15:15.638
Some of the shiny stuff, right?

15:15.731 --> 15:17.248
This was my top-pocket find.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.565
You have it with you?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.234
I do.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.235
I mean, this is
a small piece of gold,

15:21.329 --> 15:22.979
But I can't tell you...

15:22.997 --> 15:24.738
-I can see it from here.
-...What it means to me

15:24.758 --> 15:26.758
And what it meant to me
in the moment.

15:26.909 --> 15:28.167
And, um...

15:28.319 --> 15:30.094
-Marty: Oh, yeah.
-(matty sighs)

15:30.246 --> 15:31.671
I mean, just incredible.

15:31.823 --> 15:33.264
The fisher family
were awesome.

15:33.416 --> 15:35.749
Father-son team again.

15:35.769 --> 15:38.269
And what they've uncovered
is really, truly incredible.

15:38.496 --> 15:40.939
We always say it,
we're showing up for one,

15:41.090 --> 15:42.515
-Maybe two days.
-Yeah.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.943
I did not expect this moment.

15:45.094 --> 15:47.353
Marty:
And that can't be
the lone ranger,

15:47.505 --> 15:49.021
-There's more of those.
-Right.

15:49.174 --> 15:50.022
And the gentlemen
in this case,

15:50.175 --> 15:52.599
Tim and ross fisher,

15:52.694 --> 15:54.527
They knew there was a history
of gold mining in the area...

15:54.679 --> 15:55.769
-Matty: Yes.
-...When they bought
their piece of land.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.530
But they had no idea there was

15:57.682 --> 15:59.015
-A complete ship dredge there.
-That's right.

15:59.033 --> 16:00.441
As they uncovered it, just,

16:00.460 --> 16:03.019
"wow, wow, wow,
what did we buy here?"

16:03.112 --> 16:05.354
-That's right.
-So that's interesting,

16:05.373 --> 16:06.965
And that's the serendipity
side of things, too,

16:07.116 --> 16:08.424
-I guess.
-Incredible.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.118
Matty: Well, we made it.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.695
Nikoline, we're here.

16:12.788 --> 16:13.972
Two new englanders
in the south.

16:14.123 --> 16:15.473
(chuckles)

16:15.624 --> 16:16.716
-Let's go!
-(laughing): All right.

16:16.868 --> 16:18.367
Narrator:
Last year

16:18.461 --> 16:20.461
In nash county,
north carolina,

16:20.480 --> 16:22.888
Matty blake
and metal detection expert

16:22.983 --> 16:25.041
Nikoline bohr

16:25.059 --> 16:27.710
Seized a golden opportunity
for rich discoveries

16:27.729 --> 16:29.395
With father-and-son
treasure hunters

16:29.547 --> 16:31.214
Tim and ross fisher,

16:31.307 --> 16:33.992
Who have been searching
a gold dredge

16:34.219 --> 16:38.830
That they discovered
on their property back in 2019.

16:39.057 --> 16:40.647
You won't believe
what you're gonna see

16:40.667 --> 16:41.891
Just through those woods, man.

16:43.061 --> 16:46.245
-Matty: Holy moly.
-Nikoline: That is incredible.

16:46.397 --> 16:47.747
Tim f.:
Come on down and check it out,
guys.

16:47.899 --> 16:50.491
Narrator: The dredge,
which was constructed

16:50.510 --> 16:54.512
In the early 1900s,
is actually a ship

16:54.739 --> 16:56.681
That was designed to float
in shallow water

16:56.832 --> 16:59.517
While scooping soil
into compartments.

16:59.744 --> 17:02.002
Tim f.:
Check it out, guys,
it's all, uh...

17:02.096 --> 17:04.247
Very much a frankensluice.

17:04.265 --> 17:06.432
Narrator:
Just over a century later,

17:06.584 --> 17:08.026
Tim and ross have created

17:08.177 --> 17:09.752
Their own gold
processing machine,

17:09.771 --> 17:11.863
Known as the frankensluice,

17:12.014 --> 17:13.939
And a digging crane
that they hope

17:14.092 --> 17:16.701
Will help them discover
untold millions in gold

17:16.852 --> 17:19.428
That they believe is still
waiting to be found

17:19.447 --> 17:24.450
On the dredge and in old spoils
piles that it produced long ago.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.693
Well, uh, I want to see some
gold coming out of this.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.046
-Yeah.
-Let's do it.
-All right.

17:30.866 --> 17:33.384
-Come on, baby!
-Tim f.: Yes, sirree.

17:33.536 --> 17:35.386
Matty:
Oh, how about this? What's that?

17:35.538 --> 17:36.779
-Nikoline: Where, where, where?
-Matty: You think that's gold?

17:36.872 --> 17:38.614
-Tim f.: Yeah, it's gold!
-No way!

17:38.633 --> 17:39.540
-Nikoline: Good job.
-Tim f.: I can't believe it.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.133
-Aah!
-(laughter)

17:41.286 --> 17:43.302
Narrator:
Matty and nikoline

17:43.454 --> 17:45.045
Made numerous incredible
discoveries

17:45.065 --> 17:46.380
With tim and ross.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.808
-Matty: Fire it up.
-Whoo!

17:48.902 --> 17:50.401
Narrator:
Before having a portion of them
processed

17:50.553 --> 17:53.312
In the fishers'
very own gold smelting plant.

17:53.464 --> 17:55.556
-Tim f.: Put your hand out.
-(matty exhales)

17:55.575 --> 17:57.483
-Matty: Gold!
-Ross: There you go.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.244
Narrator:
The spirited and rewarding
adventure

18:00.471 --> 18:02.896
Culminated with special gifts
from the fishers,

18:02.916 --> 18:05.641
Which matty delivered
to rick and marty...

18:05.660 --> 18:07.067
-Marty: Wow!
-...Back on oak island.

18:07.087 --> 18:08.902
Marty:
I see a bunch of gold in here.

18:08.996 --> 18:10.922
Geez, didn't expect that.

18:11.149 --> 18:12.406
<i> Tim f. (over monitor):</i>
<i> It is some gold</i>

18:12.425 --> 18:14.258
From our area, off the dredge.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.260
Marty:
Very cool.

18:17.488 --> 18:19.246
I'm staying in touch
with them, and, um,

18:19.265 --> 18:20.914
When they start
pulling out more gold

18:20.934 --> 18:23.008
And those chunks of gold,
we'll know about it.

18:23.161 --> 18:24.844
Okay, well, thanks for
being our emissary.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.345
-Oh!
-They're great people.
-Oh, yeah, loved them.

18:26.497 --> 18:27.680
Matty:
They're the best.

18:27.832 --> 18:29.941
Southern hospitality
personified.

18:34.672 --> 18:37.281
Matty: We've been hot
on the trail of many

18:37.433 --> 18:41.268
Scallywags and pirates
and privateers.

18:41.362 --> 18:45.123
Some, actually a huge surprise
in what they accomplished.

18:45.274 --> 18:47.107
Others, we knew
their reputations.

18:47.201 --> 18:48.942
You know, the blackbeards
of the world, things like that.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.629
But we've been really lucky
to be with true experts

18:51.780 --> 18:54.039
On a lot of these pirates,
privateers.

18:54.192 --> 18:55.708
I know I've learned
an incredible amount of

18:55.860 --> 18:57.635
What I thought a pirate was

18:57.786 --> 19:00.621
And what they really were,
the reality behind them.

19:00.715 --> 19:04.867
The most informative trip that
we've been on, in my opinion,

19:04.960 --> 19:07.386
Was the ability
to go to your backyard...

19:07.480 --> 19:09.221
(light chuckle)

19:09.374 --> 19:11.816
...And talk to the cliffords,
barry and brandon,

19:11.967 --> 19:15.227
Father and son, again,
and talk about the<i> whydah.</i>

19:15.380 --> 19:17.822
It was informative,

19:17.973 --> 19:20.232
It was insightful, it--
to your point,

19:20.385 --> 19:24.495
It changed my perception of the
"conventional understanding"

19:24.647 --> 19:26.313
Of "pirates and piracy."

19:26.332 --> 19:29.241
And the other thing
that was quite revealing,

19:29.335 --> 19:32.411
Which I did not know at all,
when barry said to us,

19:32.563 --> 19:35.898
"it's the only
authentic pirate ship found

19:35.991 --> 19:38.567
With authentic pirate treasure."

19:38.586 --> 19:40.344
-Yes, yes.
-In the world.

19:40.496 --> 19:42.738
(thunder rumbling)

19:42.757 --> 19:44.407
Narrator:
Although more than
a dozen legends revolving

19:44.425 --> 19:47.426
Around lost pirate treasures
believed to exist

19:47.578 --> 19:50.837
Throughout the united states
have captivated searchers--

19:50.857 --> 19:53.674
Including those connected
to the likes of blackbeard,

19:53.693 --> 19:55.434
Captain william kidd,

19:55.528 --> 19:57.028
And louis aury,

19:57.179 --> 19:58.863
To date none of them
have been located.

19:59.014 --> 20:00.865
Barry clifford:
Get the divers ready.

20:01.016 --> 20:03.701
Narrator: However,
thanks to renowned explorer

20:03.852 --> 20:06.186
Barry clifford
and his son brandon,

20:06.206 --> 20:09.615
In 2022, rick, matty,

20:09.709 --> 20:12.268
And diver tony sampson
got the historic opportunity

20:12.286 --> 20:14.695
To search for artifacts
from the<i> whydah gally...</i>

20:14.789 --> 20:16.622
Matty:
Diver's in the water.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.218
...A wreck valued at more
than a billion dollars,

20:20.369 --> 20:23.963
Connected to the english
pirate black sam bellamy,

20:24.057 --> 20:27.225
Which broke apart and sank
in a storm off the coast

20:27.376 --> 20:30.619
Of cape cod, massachusetts
in 1717.

20:30.638 --> 20:33.714
In 1984, barry,

20:33.733 --> 20:36.475
Along with his friend
john f. Kennedy jr.,

20:36.569 --> 20:39.979
Located parts of the wreckage
and an estimated

20:40.073 --> 20:42.982
$400 million worth
of multicultural artifacts

20:43.076 --> 20:44.408
And valuables,

20:44.560 --> 20:46.652
Which are all preserved
and housed

20:46.804 --> 20:49.638
For public education
in two dedicated museums.

20:49.657 --> 20:51.249
Matty:
This is cool already.

20:51.476 --> 20:53.325
Wow.

20:53.478 --> 20:55.478
Brandon:
Here you see
the<i> whydah's</i> anchor.

20:55.496 --> 20:58.071
Matty:
Oh, wow. My goodness.

20:58.091 --> 21:01.259
Narrator:
During rick, matty, and tony's
adventure

21:01.410 --> 21:02.426
With the cliffords...

21:04.322 --> 21:05.821
...Tony and brandon,

21:05.840 --> 21:07.748
Who has been working
with his father

21:07.767 --> 21:10.250
For more than two decades in the
ongoing effort

21:10.270 --> 21:12.011
To recover
artifacts from the<i> whydah,</i>

21:12.163 --> 21:14.997
Made some incredible
discoveries,

21:15.090 --> 21:17.924
Including a spanish silver real.

21:18.019 --> 21:20.444
Matty:
What is that?
That looks like a coin to me!

21:20.596 --> 21:21.837
Spanish eight real, buddy.

21:21.930 --> 21:24.282
-Come on!
-Is it, really?

21:25.510 --> 21:27.860
And the thing that is indelible
in my mind is

21:28.012 --> 21:29.845
Barry and brandon's commitment

21:29.938 --> 21:33.291
To using that discovery,
which was

21:33.442 --> 21:35.701
Years in the making,

21:35.853 --> 21:39.780
And revealing this story,
but it's their commitment

21:39.874 --> 21:42.024
To, not to sell anything.

21:42.117 --> 21:43.784
-Yeah.
-The museum that they were

21:43.803 --> 21:46.211
Kind enough
to allow us to visit.

21:46.306 --> 21:50.883
Their commitment to these things
are more precious,

21:51.035 --> 21:53.477
Telling young people the story

21:53.704 --> 21:56.480
Of pirates and piracy,
the-the commitment

21:56.632 --> 21:59.299
-To preserving this history.
-Yeah.

21:59.319 --> 22:03.395
Because that has impact,
that has legacy attached to it.

22:03.489 --> 22:07.216
Another sort of tidbit
that sparked my imagination

22:07.309 --> 22:08.993
Is, the<i> whydah</i> was a slave ship.

22:09.220 --> 22:11.220
It was captured
by "black sam" bellamy.

22:11.238 --> 22:12.905
-Yep.
-Named after his hair,

22:13.057 --> 22:14.890
By the way, I looked that up.

22:14.909 --> 22:16.392
-Oh, cool!
-It's 'cause his hair
was very black.

22:16.410 --> 22:17.893
-That's cool.
-That's why he was black sam.

22:17.912 --> 22:19.745
I thought it was 'cause
he was evil or something.

22:19.897 --> 22:21.655
-Right.
-No, no, apparently
his hair was jet black.

22:21.674 --> 22:24.675
Anyway, so he captures
a slave ship

22:24.902 --> 22:28.328
And emancipates
the human beings on board,

22:28.348 --> 22:30.255
Some of which
then served on his crew.

22:30.408 --> 22:31.998
-That's right.
-Yeah, and this is

22:32.018 --> 22:33.742
A well-built ship, so he says

22:33.761 --> 22:35.077
"well, I think I'll just take
this one."

22:35.096 --> 22:37.521
That story is
the living embodiment

22:37.673 --> 22:40.524
Of what they--
the credo they lived by.

22:40.676 --> 22:44.603
Equality, democracy,
the principles of

22:44.755 --> 22:48.348
One man, one woman,
a fair share for each.

22:48.368 --> 22:52.185
And to see that history
also come up from the depths,

22:52.205 --> 22:55.206
When we were there, is just
exciting, and it was also

22:55.357 --> 22:57.766
Awesome to watch someone
like barry,

22:57.860 --> 22:59.693
Who's done what he has done,

22:59.712 --> 23:02.546
To be there when tony and I were
there on the second trip.

23:02.698 --> 23:04.106
They found an artifact

23:04.125 --> 23:07.534
That barry
feels is really important.

23:07.553 --> 23:10.796
And you could just see
and feel his excitement.

23:10.948 --> 23:13.298
The power of that artifact,
and to be there on that day,

23:13.451 --> 23:15.059
I mean, again,
the chances of that happening

23:15.210 --> 23:16.560
-When you're there
are not very good.
-That is pretty amazing.

23:16.712 --> 23:18.729
And they nailed it.

23:18.956 --> 23:20.547
Narrator:
Upon returning to cape cod

23:20.641 --> 23:22.549
Several weeks later,

23:22.568 --> 23:26.904
Matty blake and tony sampson
rejoined barry and brandon

23:27.055 --> 23:28.631
Aboard their state-of-the-art
research vessel,

23:28.649 --> 23:30.241
Known as<i> the vast explorer,</i>

23:30.392 --> 23:31.817
To investigate an area

23:31.911 --> 23:33.393
Where new sonar scans

23:33.487 --> 23:35.896
Indicated a mother lode

23:35.915 --> 23:37.806
Of the<i> whydah's</i> bounty
may lie buried

23:37.900 --> 23:39.250
Beneath the sands
on the ocean floor.

23:44.072 --> 23:46.315
Matty:
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:46.333 --> 23:48.408
Let's go!

23:48.502 --> 23:51.987
Narrator: Once again, brandon
and tony made historic finds,

23:52.080 --> 23:53.914
Including another silver real

23:54.008 --> 23:57.176
And an escutcheon plate,
believed to have once adorned

23:57.270 --> 23:59.995
A pistol belonging to one
of the<i> whydah's</i> crew members.

24:00.014 --> 24:02.331
Matty:
Wow, that's beautiful.

24:02.424 --> 24:04.166
Barry:
This is, like, amazing.

24:04.259 --> 24:07.002
This is extremely important.

24:07.021 --> 24:09.947
-Wow.
-Extremely important.

24:10.174 --> 24:12.098
Barry and brandon
have been kind enough

24:12.118 --> 24:13.617
To join us today.

24:13.844 --> 24:15.119
I believe they have
an update about

24:15.270 --> 24:16.695
Their activities to date,
after you left.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.105
And I'm hoping

24:19.200 --> 24:20.958
For some good news.

24:21.109 --> 24:22.701
Some new "a-ha!"

24:22.795 --> 24:24.295
So, they're standing by.

24:24.522 --> 24:26.088
-Great.
-I think we can get them up.

24:29.618 --> 24:31.543
-Hello, gentlemen.
-Hey, guys.
<i> -Brandon: Hey.</i>

24:31.637 --> 24:33.529
Marty:
How are you?

24:33.547 --> 24:34.880
-Hanging in there.
-Doing pretty well, thanks.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.123
How are you guys?

24:37.143 --> 24:39.535
I think hanging in there
works for us, too, actually.

24:39.628 --> 24:40.961
(chuckles)
that sounds about right.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.629
Matty:
How are things back home
since, uh,

24:42.648 --> 24:44.648
Since tony and I left?

24:44.875 --> 24:46.558
We made some pretty
shocking discoveries

24:46.652 --> 24:49.302
That we weren't, none of us
were really aware of.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.823
-Wow.
<i> -Until there was</i>
<i> a side scan sonar done.</i>

24:53.050 --> 24:55.567
This is, like, in our backyard,
we've been swimming

24:55.661 --> 24:58.737
Over this thing for 40 years,
and we never saw it.

24:58.889 --> 25:00.313
<i> Wait till you see</i>

25:00.407 --> 25:02.983
<i>What it is, and it's in perfect</i>

25:03.002 --> 25:06.078
<i> Condition in the image</i>
<i> that you'll see.</i>

25:06.230 --> 25:10.566
<i> What you're</i>
<i> looking at is approximately</i>

25:10.584 --> 25:13.493
<i> A 100-foot-long</i>
<i> section of wreckage.</i>

25:13.513 --> 25:16.071
-Oh, my god.
-Wow.

25:16.164 --> 25:18.015
Marty:
That's pretty cool.

25:25.750 --> 25:27.525
Barry:
And in the side scan,

25:27.676 --> 25:29.418
What you're looking at

25:29.436 --> 25:33.864
<i>Is a perfectly preserved section</i>
<i>of a shipwreck.</i>

25:34.016 --> 25:36.441
-Wow!
-Marty: Yeah, we see it now.

25:36.594 --> 25:38.869
<i> Barry:</i>
<i> An old shipwreck,</i>

25:39.021 --> 25:41.430
<i> Approximately</i>
<i> a hundred feet long,</i>

25:41.448 --> 25:43.949
<i> That's been completely buried,</i>

25:44.043 --> 25:47.286
<i> Because it's absolutely</i>
<i> in perfect condition.</i>

25:47.380 --> 25:49.621
Incredible image.

25:49.715 --> 25:53.125
I mean, we swim over the
top of this all the time,

25:53.219 --> 25:57.129
<i> And all of those dark areas</i>
<i> that you're seeing</i>

25:57.223 --> 26:01.466
<i> Are from objects</i>
<i> protruding up from the bottom.</i>

26:01.561 --> 26:04.228
<i>So there's a lot of</i>
<i>wreckage here that's sticking up</i>

26:04.379 --> 26:07.714
<i> Off the bottom, four,</i>
<i> five, six feet high or more.</i>

26:07.733 --> 26:11.217
<i> And this was</i>
<i> all covered with sand.</i>

26:11.237 --> 26:14.888
Again, this is directly
in shore from the cannon pile

26:14.907 --> 26:16.815
And all of the treasure
that we found

26:16.909 --> 26:18.650
<i> Over the years.</i>

26:18.803 --> 26:21.486
<i> It's scary</i>
<i> because it's uncovered now,</i>

26:21.581 --> 26:25.140
So this, this, this very well
could be the<i> whydah.</i>

26:25.159 --> 26:26.158
Wow.

26:26.310 --> 26:27.751
<i> And...</i>

26:27.978 --> 26:31.997
It looks like there's a chest,
or boxes,

26:32.091 --> 26:33.999
<i> In the image.</i>

26:34.093 --> 26:36.594
And we have to investigate
this thing immediately.

26:36.745 --> 26:38.411
That's pretty cool.

26:38.431 --> 26:40.489
So, brandon,
off your father's description

26:40.507 --> 26:42.582
I can kind of picture where
this was, and I remember

26:42.602 --> 26:44.159
On our first trip, rick and I,

26:44.178 --> 26:45.585
You were diving right around

26:45.605 --> 26:47.271
That area, but there was mung

26:47.422 --> 26:48.997
And bad conditions,

26:49.016 --> 26:50.666
And you wouldn't have seen it
anyway

26:50.759 --> 26:52.517
'cause it was covered in sand.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.336
Why is it exposed now?
Why is it showing itself now?

26:54.355 --> 26:55.779
Is this a result of storms?

26:55.931 --> 26:57.281
<i> Brandon:</i>
<i> Yeah, you know, we've had</i>

26:57.508 --> 27:00.433
A number of, like,
pretty substantial swells

27:00.453 --> 27:03.362
<i> Come to the cape over</i>
<i> the last couple months and,</i>

27:03.456 --> 27:06.849
<i> You know, big waves,</i>
<i> just digging this wreckage</i>

27:06.867 --> 27:09.868
<i> Out of the sand really, so</i>

27:10.020 --> 27:11.870
<i> This is now more exposed.</i>

27:11.964 --> 27:15.466
So it seems to be
continuously getting uncovered.

27:15.693 --> 27:17.468
<i> Barry:</i>
<i>Hey, look right here, see this?</i>

27:18.863 --> 27:20.545
-Matty: Yeah.
<i> -You can see the dark spot,</i>

27:20.698 --> 27:22.214
<i> That's the shadow.</i>

27:22.366 --> 27:24.642
<i> There's something laying</i>
<i> on the bottom there</i>

27:24.793 --> 27:26.810
<i> That hasn't been washed</i>
<i> away yet.</i>

27:28.130 --> 27:31.039
<i> That's a target right there,</i>
<i> that's a target there.</i>

27:31.058 --> 27:34.393
<i>These long objects are targets.</i>

27:34.545 --> 27:37.821
<i> The</i> whydah<i> was known to have</i>
<i> had african ivory on board.</i>

27:39.233 --> 27:40.491
<i> What are these things?</i>

27:41.810 --> 27:44.310
<i> You can see</i>
<i> all these ship's timbers.</i>

27:44.405 --> 27:45.829
<i> The ship is on its side.</i>

27:47.892 --> 27:49.241
<i> So I think we're looking at,</i>

27:49.393 --> 27:51.243
<i> You know, the side of the ship</i>

27:51.395 --> 27:54.396
<i> Because anchors are kept</i>
<i> on the side of vessels.</i>

27:54.415 --> 27:57.399
<i> That, I believe, is an anchor.</i>

27:57.418 --> 27:58.324
<i> -Do you see that?</i>
-(others assenting)

27:58.419 --> 28:00.752
Marty:
I see it now.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.829
<i> Brandon:</i>
<i> We have the potential</i>
<i> to get out</i>

28:02.848 --> 28:04.589
<i> And dive a bit,</i>
<i> but this is something</i>

28:04.742 --> 28:06.241
<i> We'll save for next season</i>

28:06.260 --> 28:07.685
Because, uh, there's
just a lot of work.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.764
Marty:
Well, it looks pretty
exciting, that's for sure.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.191
Targets galore,

28:14.342 --> 28:16.360
The actual substance
of the ship,

28:16.511 --> 28:18.178
Not just the stuff
it was carrying, so

28:18.197 --> 28:20.180
That's excellent!

28:20.274 --> 28:22.441
Congratulations on that image,
that is exciting stuff,

28:22.593 --> 28:24.927
And I hope you can get
on it as fast as possible.

28:24.945 --> 28:27.095
We want to be kept
informed as you progress.

28:27.114 --> 28:29.431
Yeah, this is a fascinating
adventure. Thank you

28:29.450 --> 28:31.600
For sharing it with us.
I mean, I-- like I say,

28:31.618 --> 28:33.711
To some extent we're jealous--
what a great find,

28:33.862 --> 28:35.546
And well done to you.

28:35.697 --> 28:37.047
Rick:
Best of luck to both of you,

28:37.274 --> 28:39.699
And if we can help,
you know our number.

28:39.719 --> 28:41.385
<i> -Thanks, guys.</i>
<i> -Thank you.</i>

28:41.536 --> 28:42.778
-Take care.
-See you later, then.

28:42.796 --> 28:43.870
Thanks a lot for your time.

28:43.964 --> 28:45.614
<i> Brandon:</i>
<i> Take care.</i>

28:45.707 --> 28:47.466
Yeah, that's pretty spectacular.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.226
Barry and brandon are
a great example of what

28:49.377 --> 28:51.787
We say-- the persistence
to keep going.

28:51.805 --> 28:54.456
And I know you guys
have been fairly persistent

28:54.549 --> 28:56.549
With this poverty island
treasure.

28:56.569 --> 28:58.551
I mean, we've taken
multiple cracks at it,

28:58.571 --> 29:01.463
You've been a couple times,
I got to go back with you.

29:01.482 --> 29:03.741
And I feel like every trip,

29:03.892 --> 29:05.409
The needle has moved

29:05.636 --> 29:06.485
A little further every trip,
it feels like.

29:06.579 --> 29:08.136
Yeah, I think so.

29:08.155 --> 29:10.247
Narrator:
During the american civil war

29:10.474 --> 29:13.083
In 1863,

29:13.235 --> 29:14.977
A believed-french ship

29:14.995 --> 29:17.312
Sank in the northern waters
of lake michigan,

29:17.331 --> 29:20.740
Near a 200-acre landmass
known as poverty island,

29:20.760 --> 29:23.427
While attempting to smuggle
five wooden chests of gold

29:23.578 --> 29:25.429
To the confederate army.

29:25.580 --> 29:30.158
The treasure, worth an estimated
$400 million in today's value,

29:30.177 --> 29:33.512
Was reportedly brought
to the surface in 1933

29:33.664 --> 29:37.182
By a team of searchers
from milwaukee, wisconsin.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.109
(thunder cracks)

29:39.261 --> 29:41.612
But unfortunately their efforts
were met with disaster

29:41.763 --> 29:45.023
As well, when a massive storm
surge sank their vessel.

29:45.117 --> 29:47.009
(thunder cracks)

29:47.102 --> 29:48.677
-This is the spot?
-Right here.

29:48.695 --> 29:51.696
Narrator:
In 2019 and 2020,

29:51.849 --> 29:53.957
Northern michigan native
marty lagina

29:54.184 --> 29:56.794
Made two attempts
to find the sunken riches

29:56.945 --> 30:00.446
With a team led
by historian bob kreipke,

30:00.466 --> 30:02.800
Searching the north and southern
coasts of poverty island.

30:06.213 --> 30:09.640
Narrator:
However, no clear signs
of treasure were found.

30:10.792 --> 30:13.293
-Matty: Here we go, rick.
-Here we go.

30:13.387 --> 30:15.461
-We have taken treasure
hunting to new heights!
-(laughs)

30:15.481 --> 30:20.208
Narrator:
Then, in the summer of 2022,

30:20.227 --> 30:23.045
Rick lagina, who still
resides in michigan's

30:23.063 --> 30:25.805
Upper peninsula,
joined his friends,

30:25.825 --> 30:27.640
Treasure hunters
mike and jess groleau,

30:27.660 --> 30:28.733
Along with matty blake

30:28.886 --> 30:30.327
To search the waters

30:30.478 --> 30:31.720
On poverty island's western
coast.

30:31.813 --> 30:33.330
-There it is, I see it.
-Yeah.

30:33.557 --> 30:34.498
-Yep.
-It's actually light-colored,

30:34.649 --> 30:35.574
It's in front of the boat.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.167
Matty:
Yep.

30:37.394 --> 30:40.320
Narrator:
Incredibly, the laginas' third

30:40.414 --> 30:41.821
Poverty island adventure
resulted

30:41.915 --> 30:43.340
In promising discoveries,

30:43.567 --> 30:47.235
As the team found
not only two shipwrecks

30:47.254 --> 30:48.512
But also potential evidence

30:48.739 --> 30:50.639
Of two chests
on the lake bottom.

30:53.260 --> 30:54.184
Copy that.

30:57.264 --> 30:58.522
Did you say a large chest?

31:00.693 --> 31:03.694
The list: Ship on top of
another ship-- we find that;

31:03.845 --> 31:05.678
Boxes chained together--

31:05.698 --> 31:08.198
He sees what looks like a box
anomaly on that dive in between,

31:08.425 --> 31:10.926
-Basically, boards of the ship.
-Mm-hmm.

31:10.944 --> 31:13.519
So everything just lined up.

31:13.539 --> 31:16.540
It was like they had made
a bullet point list.

31:16.691 --> 31:18.191
"well, first we'll see this,
then we'll see this."

31:18.210 --> 31:19.543
-Yeah, which never happens.
-It can't be,

31:19.770 --> 31:21.436
There's something wrong here.
(chuckles)

31:21.455 --> 31:23.196
And then he finds another
square-shaped anomaly,

31:23.215 --> 31:25.048
Like you said, right near there,
alone.

31:25.275 --> 31:27.292
Sitting clear as day
with a shadow coming down--

31:27.386 --> 31:29.277
I mean, you saw that imaging,
it's really exciting.

31:29.296 --> 31:31.463
Rick:
Here's the thing:
Mike and jess have made

31:31.557 --> 31:34.132
Themselves available,
I believe they have an update.

31:34.284 --> 31:35.559
And I look forward
just to talking with them.

31:35.710 --> 31:37.802
They're a wonderful couple
and they are

31:37.955 --> 31:39.396
Immersed in this story.

31:39.623 --> 31:40.789
Right.

31:40.807 --> 31:41.957
Rick:
We'll get them up.

31:41.975 --> 31:43.049
-Hi, mike, hi, jess.
-Hello.

31:43.143 --> 31:44.643
<i> Both:</i>
<i> Hey, guys!</i>

31:44.795 --> 31:46.128
How are you?

31:46.146 --> 31:47.129
<i> -We're good.</i>
<i> -Good, good.</i>

31:47.147 --> 31:48.572
We were talking about when,

31:48.723 --> 31:50.390
When matty was in the u.P.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.892
And, you know,
the finds that you made.

31:52.912 --> 31:57.230
Are you still every bit as
excited today as you were then?

31:57.249 --> 31:59.750
<i> -I think more.</i>
<i> -Yeah, we are, we're</i>

31:59.901 --> 32:02.753
Consistently moving forward
and we've been back out there

32:02.980 --> 32:06.089
At least a half a dozen times
now, if not more.

32:06.316 --> 32:08.667
And we've just got
a trove of information

32:08.819 --> 32:12.320
To dig through from
side scans and r.O.V. Video,

32:12.339 --> 32:14.339
And that's stuff
we're going through now.

32:14.491 --> 32:18.326
And what is that stuff
you're going through now?

32:18.345 --> 32:19.844
We actually went back out there

32:19.997 --> 32:21.939
To try make a dive on that box.

32:22.090 --> 32:25.425
<i> The weather was so bad</i>
<i> that we weren't able</i>

32:25.519 --> 32:28.520
<i> To get down on that box,</i>

32:28.672 --> 32:31.690
<i> So we were running</i>
<i> some more side scan sonar,</i>

32:31.842 --> 32:34.618
<i>And we have something that, uh,</i>

32:34.845 --> 32:35.844
<i> We think you guys</i>
<i> are gonna be impressed by.</i>

32:35.862 --> 32:37.862
<i>It's a really great, clear image</i>

32:38.015 --> 32:39.514
<i>We were able to send the r.O.V.</i>

32:39.533 --> 32:41.366
Down on, and we'd like
to show it to you.

32:41.518 --> 32:42.626
Yeah, let's see it.

32:46.373 --> 32:47.589
Holy moly.

32:49.376 --> 32:51.301
That's a box of some kind?

32:51.453 --> 32:54.287
-Yeah, that could be a box.
-I think it looks man-made.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.764
That's pretty big.

32:56.809 --> 32:58.100
Matty:
Wow.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.540
You can actually see
a small cable

33:05.559 --> 33:08.543
<i> Or a small chain</i>
<i> that's laying right next</i>

33:08.562 --> 33:11.822
<i> To what we think is a box.</i>

33:12.049 --> 33:13.639
Marty: I certainly see
what he's looking at

33:13.659 --> 33:15.141
-There on the left.
-Right there.

33:15.235 --> 33:17.494
What are those grooves?

33:17.645 --> 33:19.312
Marty:
Yeah, how do you interpret
those grooves?

33:19.331 --> 33:21.056
<i> Mike:</i>
<i> Yeah, I don't know, they're,</i>

33:21.074 --> 33:22.390
<i> The grooves are kind of</i>
<i> mysterious to me.</i>

33:22.484 --> 33:24.001
<i> It definitely doesn't fit</i>

33:24.228 --> 33:25.836
<i> Any other thing</i>
<i> that's around there.</i>

33:26.063 --> 33:27.504
<i> Jess:</i>
<i> I think it looks man-made.</i>

33:28.507 --> 33:30.674
Can you estimate size?

33:30.825 --> 33:32.825
I think we figured
it was probably

33:32.845 --> 33:36.013
Four or five feet, roughly,
each way.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.682
Wow, I would not have
thought that.

33:38.909 --> 33:40.425
What in that image
makes you think

33:40.577 --> 33:43.411
That's not a rock
and that's a box of some kind?

33:43.430 --> 33:45.505
<i> Mike:</i>
<i> So, I think the thing that</i>
<i> really stood out to us</i>

33:45.524 --> 33:48.767
<i> Was the slots or the,</i>
<i> you know, the vertical slots</i>

33:48.919 --> 33:51.102
<i> Or grooves that are kind</i>
<i> of carved into it.</i>

33:51.196 --> 33:52.771
Matty:
Yeah.

33:52.923 --> 33:54.422
Didn't really fit anything
else we saw there,

33:54.441 --> 33:57.108
So it definitely warrants
getting, you know,

33:57.202 --> 34:01.538
A diver down with actual eyes on
it to see what it actually is.

34:02.949 --> 34:04.766
Matty:
U.P. Michigan

34:04.785 --> 34:07.269
Winter weather--
are dive operations

34:07.287 --> 34:08.694
Pretty much ceased for now,

34:08.714 --> 34:10.547
-You think?
-Yeah, the dive operations

34:10.698 --> 34:13.366
Are done for now, but we're
looking to get out there early,

34:13.385 --> 34:15.034
<i> -Early in the spring.</i>
-Have you done any

34:15.128 --> 34:16.720
Efforts to get permits?

34:16.871 --> 34:18.388
<i> What we're doing is</i>

34:18.615 --> 34:20.949
Trying to really get
everything combined

34:20.967 --> 34:24.636
And put together to
be able to send to the state

34:24.788 --> 34:28.807
<i> As a good package that shows</i>
<i> this is the</i> captain lawrence,

34:28.959 --> 34:30.734
<i> Or this is the gold</i>
<i> and this is why because</i>

34:30.885 --> 34:33.052
What that would do is,
if those boxes are related,

34:33.146 --> 34:34.646
That would expand the area

34:34.798 --> 34:37.407
That the salvage
rights would be in as well.

34:37.559 --> 34:39.910
So, it'd give us
a larger area to work in.

34:40.061 --> 34:41.894
And that's
what I would focus on.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.306
That it is historical.

34:44.324 --> 34:45.749
You both have approached it

34:45.900 --> 34:47.976
From that perspective,
so hopefully

34:47.994 --> 34:49.811
There'll be a positive outcome.

34:49.904 --> 34:51.313
I will fly down tomorrow
to testify

34:51.331 --> 34:52.497
In front of whatever
committee it is

34:52.649 --> 34:54.649
To let you get
the salvage rights

34:54.668 --> 34:55.741
To that if it helps, 'cause

34:55.761 --> 34:58.261
You've done more on this story

34:58.413 --> 35:02.248
Quickly
than our previous efforts.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.916
This is,
everything keeps lining up.

35:03.936 --> 35:05.660
There's nothing you've presented

35:05.679 --> 35:07.771
-That doesn't fit the story.
-Right.

35:07.922 --> 35:09.439
All right, well, you're gonna
have this solved

35:09.591 --> 35:10.999
With one more season?

35:11.017 --> 35:11.683
That's what it kind of sounds
like.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.443
-Hoping.
-Yeah.

35:13.595 --> 35:15.170
Have an answer one way
or another.

35:15.263 --> 35:17.096
-Yeah.
-That'd be great.
-That's perfect.

35:17.190 --> 35:18.840
Thank you guys so much.

35:18.933 --> 35:20.842
-An amazing adventure.
-It was.

35:20.861 --> 35:22.193
And you guys were so hospitable

35:22.287 --> 35:24.287
And welcomed us so much.

35:24.514 --> 35:26.364
And we're rooting for you,
we really, really are.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.291
I want to get back
in lake michigan. (chuckles)

35:28.518 --> 35:30.201
We'll see you this
spring or summer, I hope.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.445
And you also want to get
back to the upper peninsula.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.464
-Correct?
-Of course, I'm--
you said I'm almost--

35:34.691 --> 35:36.449
Rick said I'm almost
an honorary yooper.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.042
I did.

35:38.195 --> 35:40.044
Marty: So, if you want
to be an honorary yooper,

35:40.197 --> 35:41.713
We've got a little,
a little bit of a ceremony here.

35:41.865 --> 35:43.140
Oh, yeah. (chuckles)

35:43.291 --> 35:44.549
-You ready?
-Yep.

35:44.701 --> 35:46.384
-Let's see.
-And you know what,

35:46.478 --> 35:48.979
By the way, this was done
with mike and jess's help.

35:49.130 --> 35:51.706
-Matty: I'm nervous right now.
-You should be.

35:51.725 --> 35:53.466
Oh, my gosh.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.985
This, sir, is for you.

35:55.212 --> 35:58.488
-There's your kit.
-What? Get out of here.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.282
Marty:
Open it up.

36:01.385 --> 36:02.400
No!

36:02.494 --> 36:04.953
(all laughing)

36:06.723 --> 36:08.573
Marty:
That actually
worked pretty good.

36:08.725 --> 36:10.149
Oh, yeah.

36:10.243 --> 36:11.743
Do you know what that is?

36:11.837 --> 36:13.653
Matty:
A stormy kromer?

36:13.672 --> 36:15.672
That is a stormy kromer.

36:15.823 --> 36:17.823
Fantastic.

36:17.843 --> 36:19.250
Oh, this is the plaid

36:19.403 --> 36:21.011
That we were talking about-- oh!

36:21.238 --> 36:22.179
Well, what are
mike and jess wearing?

36:22.406 --> 36:23.663
Yes.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.849
This is beautiful, guys.

36:27.093 --> 36:29.911
Oh... Wow.

36:30.004 --> 36:31.479
-Marty: Pretty nice, huh?
-"yooper matty."

36:32.840 --> 36:35.192
-It's more than pretty nice.
-Put the things on

36:35.343 --> 36:36.267
-Properly.
-All right.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.528
<i> (jess laughs)</i>

36:38.680 --> 36:40.588
-That's good, that's it.
-There you go.

36:40.607 --> 36:42.941
-(laughter)
-marty: You look like a yooper,

36:43.035 --> 36:44.534
-That's looking good.
-But there's one more thing.

36:45.762 --> 36:47.095
-Matty: Hi, menna.
-Hello, menna,

36:47.188 --> 36:48.613
-What have you got there?
-Hi there.

36:48.765 --> 36:51.449
Actually, he needs to identify
what this is,

36:51.601 --> 36:52.542
Would be good, too.

36:52.694 --> 36:55.270
-Okay.
-Let me see.

36:55.363 --> 36:57.121
-I'll let you do the...
-Okay.

36:57.274 --> 36:58.548
Let's see what's in here.

37:01.778 --> 37:02.944
Oh, I think I remember this!

37:02.963 --> 37:04.446
-I know I do.
-What is that?

37:04.464 --> 37:05.613
A, a patsy.

37:05.632 --> 37:06.965
(laughter)

37:07.059 --> 37:08.132
Pasty-- pasty!

37:08.285 --> 37:09.951
Rick:
All right!

37:10.044 --> 37:11.803
-Pasty, right?
-(laughter)

37:11.897 --> 37:12.878
It's a pasty.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.122
-Pasty!
-Yes.

37:14.140 --> 37:16.641
Oh, yes, yes, okay, a patsy.

37:16.793 --> 37:18.643
-Pasty.
-Pasty!

37:18.737 --> 37:20.462
Put the shirt on.

37:20.555 --> 37:22.388
And before
you take a bite of that,

37:22.407 --> 37:23.389
Which is the final

37:23.408 --> 37:25.467
-Indoctrination.
-Okay.

37:25.485 --> 37:27.077
Is there something weird in it?

37:27.228 --> 37:28.636
Marty:
No, it's... No,

37:28.655 --> 37:30.305
It's good, that's a good pasty.

37:30.398 --> 37:31.806
Okay, you're looking more yooper

37:31.899 --> 37:32.974
-All the time.
-How am I doing?

37:33.067 --> 37:34.659
-All right.
-Looking good.

37:34.811 --> 37:36.235
And that is my grandmother's
recipe, by the way.

37:36.255 --> 37:38.329
-Aw!
-Shoot, now I want some of it

37:38.482 --> 37:39.756
-More than ever.
-That's awesome.

37:39.907 --> 37:42.408
-Now wait, the words, right?
-Okay.

37:42.502 --> 37:45.929
Well, in the u.P. We say,

37:46.156 --> 37:48.006
"so, you wanting
to be a yooper, eh?"

37:48.158 --> 37:49.415
And you say,

37:49.509 --> 37:51.768
"yeah, sure, you betcha."

37:51.919 --> 37:53.678
(laughs)
all right, let's see what I...

37:53.830 --> 37:55.755
All right, you ready,
you ready, you ready?

37:55.774 --> 37:56.922
And then you have a bite of
the pasty.

37:57.017 --> 37:58.349
-All right, ready?
-Go ahead.

37:58.502 --> 38:00.426
So, you want to be
a yooper, eh?

38:00.520 --> 38:02.520
Yeah, sure, you betcha!

38:02.672 --> 38:04.114
(laughs)

38:04.265 --> 38:06.098
I guess he passed--
what do you think?

38:06.118 --> 38:07.600
-Should we let him in?
-How'd I do?

38:07.694 --> 38:08.451
-Great.
-You're in.

38:08.678 --> 38:09.769
(laughs)

38:09.863 --> 38:11.513
Matty:
I get emotional

38:11.606 --> 38:13.031
At these things,
and I'm not going to.

38:13.183 --> 38:14.440
So, I'm just going to
say thank you, thank you,

38:14.459 --> 38:16.442
This is above and beyond,
and, um,

38:16.536 --> 38:19.963
It, it, um, it symbolizes

38:20.190 --> 38:22.966
How the people are
in the upper peninsula.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.470
(soft chuckle)

38:29.049 --> 38:30.974
(pats table)

38:31.125 --> 38:33.217
-You go.
-All you got to say is...
-He did get emotional.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.719
"you betcha."

38:34.871 --> 38:36.704
You betcha!

38:36.723 --> 38:37.647
You betcha.

38:37.799 --> 38:39.465
Yeah, you betcha, eh?

38:39.559 --> 38:41.133
-You betcha, eh?
-Amazing.

38:41.153 --> 38:42.210
All right, till the next time.

38:42.228 --> 38:43.987
-Thank you both.
-Thank you.

38:44.214 --> 38:45.730
-Stay on course.
<i> -Jess: Thanks, we will.</i>

38:45.882 --> 38:48.550
-Marty: All right, bye-bye.
-Bye.
-Bye.

38:48.643 --> 38:52.311
Amazing people,
amazing place.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.331
I mean, it's been
an incredible year.

38:54.558 --> 38:56.482
Like I said at the beginning
of this whole thing,

38:56.501 --> 38:57.650
We found treasure.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.318
Every step along the way

38:59.338 --> 39:00.912
We at least found
corroborating evidence--

39:01.064 --> 39:02.672
Artifacts,
incredible artifacts--

39:02.824 --> 39:05.249
But it brings to mind
a question: Looking back now

39:05.402 --> 39:09.904
At this year, if you

39:09.997 --> 39:13.908
Had to pick one tomorrow
to go hunt,

39:13.927 --> 39:15.852
Which of our adventures
this year would you choose?

39:17.747 --> 39:19.189
Well...

39:26.514 --> 39:28.347
I mean, they were all
fantastic.

39:28.367 --> 39:29.849
All, almost just
off-the-charts incredible,

39:29.868 --> 39:31.426
Right, for all kinds of reasons.

39:31.444 --> 39:34.037
History,
the application of science,

39:34.188 --> 39:38.023
The fortitude, the perseverance,
the legacy left by forebearers,

39:38.118 --> 39:40.877
They all have really,
uh, quite a unique signature.

39:41.028 --> 39:45.123
But I'm going to quote dorothy
from<i> the wizard of oz,</i>

39:45.217 --> 39:46.383
"there's no place like home."

39:46.534 --> 39:48.443
(matty laughs)

39:48.536 --> 39:50.111
I would go back to mike
and jess.

39:50.130 --> 39:52.371
Excellent. Marty?

39:52.465 --> 39:55.299
You said tomorrow.
It's winter, okay?

39:55.394 --> 39:57.209
-Mmm.
-I, tomorrow, would

39:57.229 --> 40:00.805
Go to key west and get
back on top of the<i> atocha,</i>

40:00.899 --> 40:02.306
That's what I would do tomorrow.

40:02.401 --> 40:04.308
But if I could only be in one

40:04.403 --> 40:05.960
For, say, the rest of my life,

40:05.979 --> 40:07.720
I'd stay in my backyard

40:07.814 --> 40:09.239
And I'd be looking
off poverty island

40:09.466 --> 40:10.907
Till I solved that.

40:11.134 --> 40:14.059
So, it's a small variation
on what rick said.

40:14.154 --> 40:15.728
Matty:
It's a good point.

40:15.747 --> 40:16.896
I-I don't even know that I could
answer my own question

40:16.990 --> 40:18.656
Because
I love them all so much,

40:18.808 --> 40:19.991
But selfishly the first thing
that comes to mind

40:20.143 --> 40:22.143
Is, I would like you guys
to get to the ones

40:22.162 --> 40:23.811
That you weren't able to go to,

40:23.905 --> 40:25.813
Like the gold dredge
in north carolina

40:25.832 --> 40:29.333
And meet that family
and do that whole thing.

40:29.486 --> 40:32.244
But I also think, as you said,
"there's no place like home,"

40:32.338 --> 40:35.098
And isn't it funny that two
of the most successful journeys

40:35.249 --> 40:36.007
That we looked at,

40:36.101 --> 40:38.083
One's in your backyard

40:38.178 --> 40:39.585
With the poverty island mystery

40:39.679 --> 40:40.937
And then the<i> whydah</i>
in my backyard.

40:41.088 --> 40:42.497
That's kind of incredible,

40:42.590 --> 40:43.606
Out of all the possible
mysteries.

40:43.833 --> 40:45.090
-Mm-hmm.
-Um,

40:45.185 --> 40:47.335
I might want to go home,
but then again,

40:47.428 --> 40:49.837
They didn't make me a box
or a pasty,

40:49.856 --> 40:52.507
So I think I might go back
to michigan with you guys.

40:52.600 --> 40:55.510
Look, you are going home
in one sense

40:55.603 --> 40:56.786
If you go back
to poverty island.

40:56.938 --> 40:59.013
You're in the u.P.,
you are home.

40:59.106 --> 41:01.365
-Thank you.
-There are a lot of people

41:01.460 --> 41:02.942
Looking for their own treasures,

41:03.036 --> 41:04.944
You know, which is really cool.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.797
Rick: And you know what
really sparks my interest is,

41:08.024 --> 41:10.467
There are some
fascinating stories out there.

41:10.618 --> 41:13.452
The door doesn't close, it never
closes on treasure hunts.

41:13.546 --> 41:15.546
And that has, through eons,

41:15.699 --> 41:18.308
There's always
a treasure hunt somewhere.

41:18.535 --> 41:22.370
Guys, this has been
an awesome year, it really has.

41:22.463 --> 41:23.963
All right, well,
let's be on our way then.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.540
-Off to a new adventure.
-Yep.

41:25.558 --> 41:27.967
-There's lots to do.
-A lot to do right here.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.544
Marty:
To the hunt.

41:29.562 --> 41:31.212
-Rick: To the hunt.
-Matty: To the hunt.

41:31.305 --> 41:32.547
-Marty: To more treasure hunts.
-Matty: I love it.
