WEBVTT

00:07.578 --> 00:09.079
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.141
RYDER, LENNOX, POKER NIGHT!

00:11.142 --> 00:13.213
LET'S GO, GET DOWN HERE. IT'S
FAMILY TOGETHERNESS TIME

00:13.214 --> 00:14.614
WHERE I TAKE ALL YOUR MONEY.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.645
WISH WE COULD,

00:15.646 --> 00:18.017
BUT ZANDER IS TAKING
ME TO AN ART SHOW.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.151
IT'S PHOTOS OF PEOPLE
TAKING PHOTOS OF PEOPLE.

00:21.152 --> 00:22.792
IT'S VERY META.

00:22.793 --> 00:25.024
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO JUST
PARKING BEHIND THE SUPERMARKET

00:25.025 --> 00:26.626
AND MAKING OUT?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.228
- WHAT THE...?
- I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.730
DO THE META THING.

00:31.802 --> 00:33.663
I LIKE THIS NEW
ARTIST BOYFRIEND.

00:33.664 --> 00:35.635
- HE SEEMS PRETTY HARMLESS.
- ( door closes )

00:35.636 --> 00:37.637
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A
HARMLESS 17-YEAR-OLD BOY,

00:37.638 --> 00:38.669
MEL, UNLESS HE'S NEUTERED.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.742
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN LENNOX
BROKE UP WITH HASKELL

00:42.743 --> 00:43.774
RIGHT BEFORE SHE MET ZANDER?

00:44.715 --> 00:47.317
THOSE WERE THE HAPPIEST
NINE MINUTES OF MY LIFE.

00:47.318 --> 00:48.748
- HEY, THERE HE IS.
- WHAT'S UP?

00:48.749 --> 00:50.280
YOU READY TO BLEED SOME MONEY?

00:50.281 --> 00:52.152
CAN'T TONIGHT, JOE. SCHOOL
CAMPING TRIP'S TOMORROW

00:52.153 --> 00:54.254
AND A BUNCH OF US ARE GOING OVER
TO MARK'S HOUSE TO HANG OUT.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.625
OH, AND THAT'S MORE FUN
THAN HANGING OUT WITH US?

00:55.626 --> 00:57.487
WELL, IT'S CHEAPER.

00:57.488 --> 00:59.289
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU GUYS.

00:59.290 --> 01:02.162
- SEE YOU.
- ( door closes )

01:02.163 --> 01:03.493
OKAY, WELL...

01:03.494 --> 01:04.634
GUESS IT'S JUST

01:04.635 --> 01:06.336
THE TWO OF US THEN.

01:06.337 --> 01:08.498
YEAH, IT'S GONNA
HAPPEN A LOT NOW.

01:08.499 --> 01:10.600
YOU KNOW, US. ALONE IN AN...

01:10.601 --> 01:12.642
EMPTY HOUSE.

01:12.643 --> 01:14.774
I'M SURE WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOMETHING
FUN TO DO WITH EACH OTHER.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.476
LIKE WHAT?

01:16.477 --> 01:18.479
( cellphone ringing )

01:21.612 --> 01:23.213
IS THAT COMING FROM YOUR PANTS?

01:23.214 --> 01:24.614
YEP.

01:24.615 --> 01:26.085
THAT WOULD BE MY PHONE.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.357
OH LOOK, IT'S TATIANA.

01:27.358 --> 01:29.789
MM, WHAT DID SHE DO TO MERIT
SUCH A CLASSY RINGTONE?

01:29.790 --> 01:32.563
( chuckles ) DON'T ASK QUESTIONS
YOU DON'T WANT ANSWERED, MEL.

01:34.625 --> 01:36.166
HEY THERE.

01:36.167 --> 01:37.827
( clears throat )

01:37.828 --> 01:38.828
We've noticed it too.

01:38.829 --> 01:40.700
One A-list celebrity
after another

01:40.701 --> 01:42.172
hooking up with the nanny.

01:42.173 --> 01:43.833
Now you know who I'm
talking about, right, Kev?

01:43.834 --> 01:45.235
Listen, Jude Law,

01:45.236 --> 01:46.236
Ethan Hawke,

01:46.237 --> 01:47.677
Robin Williams.

01:47.678 --> 01:49.639
Something must
happen in the house

01:49.640 --> 01:51.511
that people just can't fight.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.544
OH, THEY CAN FIGHT IT,
BECAUSE IT'S JUST GROSS.

01:54.545 --> 01:56.486
HEY.

01:56.487 --> 01:58.788
ALL RIGHT, DO DID YOU THINK OF SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD DO WITH EACH OTHER?

01:58.789 --> 02:01.192
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

02:26.177 --> 02:28.378
BUT I THINK I'VE DEVELOPED
THE SKILL SET NECESSARY

02:28.379 --> 02:30.450
TO STUFF SWEATPANTS
INTO A DUFFEL BAG.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.653
OKAY. YOUR FLY'S DOWN.

02:34.785 --> 02:37.227
SO, THREE DAYS OUT IN
THE WILDERNESS, HUH?

02:37.228 --> 02:38.828
YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO
VIDEO GAMES OUT THERE,

02:38.829 --> 02:40.159
NO TEXTING.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.631
OH, AND THE ONLY
ANGRY BIRDS ARE...

02:41.632 --> 02:43.333
ANGRY BIRDS.

02:43.334 --> 02:45.795
I THINK I'LL SURVIVE.

02:45.796 --> 02:47.898
( chuckles ) I'M SURE YOU WILL.
WHERE'S YOUR OTHER SHOE?

02:50.241 --> 02:53.503
- OH MAN, I DON'T KNOW.
- RYDER, YOUR SIZE 48 SHOE

02:53.504 --> 02:56.707
- WAS IN THE SHOWER.
- SEE? SOLVED IT.

02:58.309 --> 02:59.810
LOOK AT YOU ALL GROWN
UP WITH YOUR TWO SHOES.

03:01.312 --> 03:04.183
WOW, YOU ARE LOOKING AWFULLY
ARMANI THIS MORNING.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.317
OH, YOU KNOW NOTHING. I'M
ACTUALLY VERY HUGO BOSS.

03:07.318 --> 03:09.359
- BECAUSE?
- BECAUSE I HAVE A JOB INTERVIEW.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.790
A VERY BIG JOB
INTERVIEW, ACTUALLY.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.662
AND I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU
WOULDN'T TELL YOUR AUNT MEL BECAUSE...

03:12.663 --> 03:14.924
- IT'S BEST NOT TO TELL HER STUFF.
- THAT'S HOW WE LIVE.

03:14.925 --> 03:16.195
THANK YOU.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.498
WOW, YOU LOOK NICE.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.470
WERE YOU INDICTED?

03:20.471 --> 03:22.802
ACTUALLY, I'M ON MY
WAY TO A FUNERAL.

03:22.803 --> 03:23.973
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

03:23.974 --> 03:25.235
ANYONE WE KNOW?

03:25.236 --> 03:26.506
YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.508
IT'S UM...

03:28.509 --> 03:30.740
THE TRASH MAN.

03:30.741 --> 03:33.383
ODD, I COULD HAVE SWORN
I SAW HIM THIS MORNING.

03:33.384 --> 03:34.584
YEAH.

03:34.585 --> 03:35.985
YOU KNOW, IN MY
GRIEF, I MISSPOKE.

03:35.986 --> 03:38.648
I MEANT THE MAILMAN.

03:38.649 --> 03:40.850
I WOULD SEND A SYMPATHY CARD,

03:40.851 --> 03:43.853
BUT THERE'S NO ONE
TO DELIVER IT.

03:43.854 --> 03:46.526
YOU KNOW, I SENSE YOU'RE
COVERING SOMETHING,

03:46.527 --> 03:48.598
BUT IN ORDER TO PURSUE IT,
I WOULD HAVE TO CARE.

03:48.599 --> 03:50.330
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY I DON'T.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.401
ALL RIGHT, BYE, GUYS.

03:51.402 --> 03:52.562
SEE YOU IN FOUR DAYS.

03:52.563 --> 03:54.704
OH THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE LEAVING TODAY.

03:54.705 --> 03:57.837
OH, MY LITTLE BABY NEPHEW.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.969
LITTLE? BURKE, THAT
KID'S A GIRAFFE.

03:59.970 --> 04:03.614
IF HE GROWS ANY TALLER, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO START RECUTTING THE DOORS.

04:08.379 --> 04:09.749
( door opens )

04:09.750 --> 04:11.851
FANTASTIC COMMITTEE
HEARING TODAY.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.653
I WAS ELECTRIFYING.

04:13.654 --> 04:17.327
THE ENTIRE ZONING COMMISSION
WAS HANGING ON MY EVERY WORD.

04:17.328 --> 04:19.459
HUH. LOOK WHAT
ZANDER DREW FOR ME.

04:19.460 --> 04:21.791
AND NOW I'M HOME AND MY
POWER TO CAPTIVATE IS GONE.

04:21.792 --> 04:23.663
NO, LOOK. ISN'T IT AWESOME?

04:23.664 --> 04:24.864
OH, SO AWESOME.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.666
I MEAN JUST AS AWESOME
AS THE OTHER 30 DRAWINGS

04:26.667 --> 04:28.798
HE DID THAT LOOK
EXACTLY THE SAME.

04:28.799 --> 04:29.999
NO, THIS IS DIFFERENT.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.001
SEE, THIS IS ME
LOOKING TO THE LEFT.

04:32.002 --> 04:36.746
BEST ONES ARE WHERE I'M LOOKING
SLIGHTLY UP AND TO THE RIGHT.

04:36.747 --> 04:38.648
DOES THIS KID DRAW
ANYTHING ELSE?

04:38.649 --> 04:40.310
ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE
YOU GETTING AT?

04:40.311 --> 04:42.312
WELL, HONEY, HE'S
OBSESSED WITH YOU.

04:42.313 --> 04:43.684
ENJOY IT. DOESN'T LAST LONG.

04:44.755 --> 04:45.985
HEY.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.657
OH MY...

04:47.658 --> 04:48.988
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

04:48.989 --> 04:51.321
DOESN'T THIS GUY KNOW HOW
TO DRAW ANYTHING ELSE?

04:51.322 --> 04:53.863
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE DATING
A XEROX MACHINE.

04:53.864 --> 04:55.995
YOU TWO ARE DEAD INSIDE,

04:55.996 --> 04:58.668
LIKE HUSKS OF CORN
LEFT OUT IN THE SUN.

04:58.669 --> 05:01.572
HUSKS OF CORN WHO
BUY YOUR CLOTHES.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.004
WOW, I THOUGHT YOU MADE UP

05:05.005 --> 05:07.477
THE WHOLE FUNERAL STORY. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE THAT CLOSE TO THE MAILMAN.

05:07.478 --> 05:08.678
OH, THE MAILMAN'S FINE.

05:08.679 --> 05:10.810
ONLY THING THAT GOT BURIED
TODAY WAS MY CAREER.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.912
ISN'T THAT OLD NEWS?

05:12.943 --> 05:15.715
I MEAN, AWW.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.517
YOU KNOW ZEV BUCHWALD
FROM DOWN THE STREET,

05:17.518 --> 05:19.519
THE SPORTING GOODS GUY?
HE'S EXPANDING CITY WIDE

05:19.520 --> 05:20.650
AND HE COMES UP TO ME THE
OTHER DAY AND HE SAYS

05:20.651 --> 05:22.352
"HEY, JOE, WE COULD REALLY
USE SOMEBODY LIKE YOU."

05:22.353 --> 05:24.994
- WELL, THAT SOUNDS POSITIVE.
- YEAH, HIS MASSIVE EXPANSION

05:24.995 --> 05:27.997
MEANS HE NEEDS HELP AROUND THE
HOUSE WORKING AS THE NANNY.

05:27.998 --> 05:30.660
YOU KNOW, PUSHING THE
STROLLERS, WIPING THE BUTTS.

05:30.661 --> 05:32.662
WELL, YEAH, LOOK ON
THE BRIGHT SIDE...

05:32.663 --> 05:35.665
THE MAILMAN'S NOT DEAD.

05:35.666 --> 05:37.467
HERE'S THE THING THOUGH...
THE OFFER HE GAVE ME

05:37.468 --> 05:39.569
WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD. AND I THINK
I MAY EVEN GET HIM TO COME UP.

05:39.570 --> 05:41.841
WHAT? WHOA. ARE YOU
NEGOTIATING A SALARY?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.674
NO, ARE YOU KIDDING? IF I
TAKE ANOTHER JOB LIKE THIS,

05:44.675 --> 05:46.676
- THEN I REALLY WILL BE A NANNY.
- WELL, AREN'T YOU ONE NOW?

05:46.677 --> 05:48.378
I'M JUST ASKING.

05:48.379 --> 05:50.349
NO, I'M NOT. I ONLY
WORK AS A NANNY.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.822
ALL RIGHT, WHAT I AM IS AN
EXECUTIVE IN TRANSITION

05:52.823 --> 05:54.784
WHO TOOK A TEMPORARY
JOB TO TIDE HIM OVER.

05:54.785 --> 05:55.955
YEAH. THREE YEARS AGO.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.687
- I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT?
- NOTHING.

05:57.688 --> 06:00.860
YOU KNOW, IT'S OBVIOUS
WHY THEY WANT YOU...

06:00.861 --> 06:02.662
RYDER AND LENNOX ARE GOOD KIDS.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.663
YOU'RE A BIG PART OF THAT.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.795
I'M AN EVEN BIGGER PART.
( chuckles )

06:05.796 --> 06:08.468
BUT YOU KNOW, NUMBERS AREN'T IMPORTANT.
IT'S NOT A PIE CHART.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.871
THERE'S ANOTHER THING
YOU'RE GREAT AT... PIES.

06:12.142 --> 06:13.703
I DO MAKE A DAMN
GOOD CHERRY PIE.

06:13.704 --> 06:15.004
WE ALL NEED YOU
AROUND HERE, JOE.

06:15.005 --> 06:17.647
NO NO, YOU DON'T. YOU DON'T.

06:17.648 --> 06:19.008
LOOK, ALL RYDER'S FRIENDS DRIVE.

06:19.009 --> 06:21.010
LENNOX SPENDS ALL HER
TIME WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

06:21.011 --> 06:23.553
SERIOUSLY, MEL, I GOT NOTHING TO
DO HERE ALL DAY BUT LIFT WEIGHTS.

06:23.554 --> 06:25.755
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME, YOU KNOW?

06:25.756 --> 06:27.457
I'VE NEVER BEEN ANY HOTTER.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.689
AND YET I'M EMPTY INSIDE.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.021
I'M LIKE THIS INSANELY LEAN-CUT

06:32.022 --> 06:33.563
SHELL OF A MAN.

06:33.564 --> 06:35.665
I MEAN, GIVE ME ONE REASON
WHY YOU NEED ME HERE...

06:35.666 --> 06:37.427
- WE...
- ...BESIDES PIES,

06:37.428 --> 06:38.398
OR DINNER,

06:38.399 --> 06:39.929
OR ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DIGEST.

06:39.930 --> 06:43.002
SURE THERE AREN'T THAT MANY
MINUTE-TO-MINUTE THINGS WITH THE KIDS,

06:43.003 --> 06:44.434
BUT I THINK OF YOU LIKE...

06:44.435 --> 06:46.005
( exhales ) LIKE...

06:46.006 --> 06:47.807
LIKE THIS FIRE
EXTINGUISHER OVER HERE.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.739
OKAY, YOU DON'T
NEED IT EVERY DAY,

06:49.740 --> 06:52.912
BUT WHEN YOU DO, IT'S RIGHT
HERE WAITING FOR YOU.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.814
HANGING ON THE WALL.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.015
YEAH YEAH.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.147
I WANT YOU ON THAT WALL.
I NEED YOU ON THAT WALL.

06:58.148 --> 07:00.150
READY TO SPRAY YOURSELF
ALL OVER ANY PROBLEM.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.693
( chuckles ) YOU KNOW, MAYBE...

07:03.694 --> 07:06.025
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.027
MAYBE THIS IS IT
FOR ME, YOU KNOW?

07:08.028 --> 07:10.029
MAYBE I'M GONNA BE DOING THIS
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.202
NANNY JOE. JOE THE NANNY.

07:13.203 --> 07:15.705
END OF STORY.

07:15.706 --> 07:17.837
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING THAT FINAL

07:17.838 --> 07:20.540
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROOM OR
ELSE YOU END UP LOOKING STUPID.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.741
JOE, STAY.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.074
I'M NOT SURE I CAN, BURKE.

07:31.582 --> 07:33.753
JOE'S SERIOUSLY
CONSIDERING THE OFFER.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.155
HE MIGHT ACTUALLY GO WORK FOR THOSE
AWFUL PEOPLE ACROSS THE STREET.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.027
THE BUCHWALDS ARE VERY NICE.

07:38.028 --> 07:39.859
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.631
FINE, I'LL BADMOUTH
THE NEIGHBORS.

07:41.632 --> 07:44.594
THEIR MAILBOX PISSES ME OFF!

07:44.595 --> 07:47.036
CAN YOU HELP ME COME UP WITH
SOMETHING TO KEEP JOE BUSY?

07:47.037 --> 07:48.898
HE THINKS THERE'S NO
REASON FOR HIM TO BE HERE.

07:48.899 --> 07:51.000
UH, MAYBE 'CAUSE THERE'S NOT.

07:51.001 --> 07:53.644
YOU KNEW JOE WASN'T GONNA
BE AROUND HERE FOREVER.

07:55.045 --> 07:56.906
IS THIS ABOUT
LOSING AN EMPLOYEE,

07:56.907 --> 07:58.708
OR IS IT SOMETHING MORE?

07:58.709 --> 07:59.909
NO.

07:59.910 --> 08:01.751
IT'S LESS, MUCH LESS.

08:01.752 --> 08:03.553
I JUST WANT JOE
TO FEEL WANTED...

08:03.554 --> 08:04.954
I MEAN, NECESSARY.

08:04.955 --> 08:07.557
AND I WILL FIND IMPORTANT
NECESSARY THINGS FOR HIM TO DO.

08:07.558 --> 08:08.988
EVEN IF YOU HAVE
TO MAKE STUFF UP?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.121
OH PLEASE. I'M HARDLY
THAT DESPERATE.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.524
SOLAR PANELS.

08:15.065 --> 08:17.026
- WHAT?
- I'M GONNA GET JOE

08:17.027 --> 08:19.899
TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS
ALL OVER THE ROOF.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.771
IT'S PHYSICAL, IT'S DANGEROUS

08:21.772 --> 08:24.273
AND HE CAN WORK SHIRTLESS,
WHICH HE OBVIOUSLY LIVES FOR.

08:24.274 --> 08:27.036
I AM GOOD.

08:27.037 --> 08:29.639
WAIT A MINUTE, DIDN'T JOE
WANT TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS

08:29.640 --> 08:31.681
LIKE TWO YEARS AGO
AND YOU SAID NO?

08:31.682 --> 08:32.782
EXACTLY.

08:32.783 --> 08:33.913
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE I CAVED,

08:33.914 --> 08:35.915
AND JOE LOVES IT WHEN I CAVE.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.247
OH, BUT YOU'RE NOT
REALLY CAVING, ARE YOU?

08:38.248 --> 08:39.589
OF COURSE NOT.

08:39.590 --> 08:41.250
I MANIPULATE, I BEND THE TRUTH,

08:41.251 --> 08:43.222
I STEAL DIET SUGAR PACKETS.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.755
BUT I NEVER CAVE.

08:47.898 --> 08:49.229
( school bell ringing )

08:50.761 --> 08:52.161
THE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
DOESN'T GET

08:52.162 --> 08:53.202
THAT I ONLY WANT TO
APPLY TO ART SCHOOLS.

08:53.203 --> 08:55.565
HE IS A NARROW-MINDED ART HATER.

08:55.566 --> 08:56.666
NOT LIKE YOU.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.237
NO. I LOVE ART.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.909
I THINK ART IS CUTE AND I
WANT TO KISS IT ON THE NOSE.

08:59.910 --> 09:01.070
( kisses )

09:01.071 --> 09:02.772
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M
GONNA TELL THAT

09:02.773 --> 09:04.914
LAME GUIDANCE COUNSELOR
IT'S ART SCHOOL OR NOTHING

09:04.915 --> 09:05.915
WHEN I SEE HIM AT 1:00.

09:05.916 --> 09:08.718
UH, IT'S 1:15, HONEY.

09:08.719 --> 09:10.250
CRAP. HE'S GONNA SEND
ME TO FLORIDA STATE.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.927
YOU KNOW FOR AN ARTIST,

09:17.928 --> 09:20.029
HE'S GOT A REALLY NICE BUTT.

09:20.030 --> 09:21.591
I KNOW.

09:21.592 --> 09:23.192
AND HE'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

09:23.193 --> 09:24.735
I DON'T KNOW HOW I LIVE WITH IT.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.236
IS THIS ZANDER'S SKETCH BOOK?

09:27.237 --> 09:28.638
YEAH.

09:28.639 --> 09:30.770
YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN TELL?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.571
ME.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.244
OH, ME.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.907
STRANGE BRUNETTE.

09:37.908 --> 09:40.279
ME.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.781
STRANGE BRUNETTE.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.182
STRANGE BRUNETTE AGAIN.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.785
- WHO IS SHE?
- I DON'T KNOW,

09:45.786 --> 09:48.257
- BUT I'M GONNA FIND OUT.
- SHE'S VERY PRETTY.

09:48.258 --> 09:49.790
YEAH, FOR NOW.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.793
LOOK AT THIS ELECTRIC BILL.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.224
IT IS SO HIGH.

09:55.225 --> 09:57.767
WHOO.

09:57.768 --> 09:58.999
HIGH.

10:00.931 --> 10:02.802
CHECK THIS. THE SCHOOL'S
ALREADY POSTING PICS

10:02.803 --> 10:04.003
OF RYDER'S CAMPING TRIP.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.775
HERE'S RYDER PADDLING A CANOE.

10:05.776 --> 10:08.077
RYDER STANDING UP IN A CANOE.

10:08.078 --> 10:10.910
HERE'S TWO GUYS FISHING
RYDER OUT OF THE WATER.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.112
WELL, I BET THERE'S
NO PICTURE OF HIM

10:13.113 --> 10:15.044
TURNING OFF A LIGHT AFTER
HE'S DONE USING IT.

10:15.045 --> 10:17.246
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY NEED
SOME CHEAPER POWER.

10:17.247 --> 10:19.919
YOU KNOW? SOME
DEPENDABLE ENERGY.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.390
AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE.

10:21.391 --> 10:24.253
I DON'T KNOW. PANELS
OF SOME KIND.

10:24.254 --> 10:26.796
PERHAPS SOLAR.

10:26.797 --> 10:29.098
I TOLD YOU THAT TWO YEARS AGO.

10:29.099 --> 10:30.259
OH MY GOSH, YOU DID.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.902
HA. BOY, OLDER AND WISER, HUH?

10:32.903 --> 10:33.933
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:33.934 --> 10:35.965
I BET YOU COULD INSTALL THEM.

10:35.966 --> 10:37.907
ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU
WERE WRONG AND I WAS RIGHT?

10:37.908 --> 10:39.809
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, JOE.

10:39.810 --> 10:42.842
THAT IS WHAT I'M SAYING.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.274
I'M NOT BUYING IT. I THINK
YOU'RE MAKING THIS UP.

10:45.275 --> 10:46.716
YOU DON'T WANT SOLAR PANELS.

10:46.717 --> 10:48.117
YES, I DO. I DO
WITH ALL MY HEART.

10:48.118 --> 10:50.219
NO. NO YOU DON'T.

10:50.220 --> 10:52.782
YOU'RE JUST TRYING
TO KEEP ME BUSY.

10:52.783 --> 10:54.423
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

10:54.424 --> 10:56.986
THIS IS A PITY SOLARIZATION.

10:56.987 --> 10:59.088
JOE, DOES IT REALLY MATTER?

10:59.089 --> 11:00.790
YES, IT DOES MATTER, OKAY?

11:00.791 --> 11:03.032
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID TO SAY
WHAT THIS IS REALLY ABOUT.

11:03.033 --> 11:04.393
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ME.

11:04.394 --> 11:05.935
I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS.

11:05.936 --> 11:09.068
YOU KNOW, I'VE FELT IT
FOR A LONG TIME TOO.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.269
YOU HAVE?

11:10.270 --> 11:13.402
WELL THEN, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD SAY IT FIRST.

11:13.403 --> 11:14.804
OKAY, FINE.

11:14.805 --> 11:15.946
I WILL.

11:19.810 --> 11:21.680
YOU DON'T THINK I CAN
GET ANOTHER JOB.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.313
THAT'S IT. NO, THAT'S NOT...
WAIT, THAT'S NOT IT.

11:24.314 --> 11:25.785
WHAT? OF COURSE YOU
CAN GET ANOTHER JOB.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.086
NO NO. YOU DON'T THINK I CAN.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.257
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M
GONNA PROVE TO YOU

11:28.258 --> 11:29.789
THAT I ACTUALLY CAN
GET ANOTHER JOB.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.920
I'M GONNA CALL
THAT BUCHWALD GUY,

11:30.921 --> 11:32.061
AND IF THAT JOB IS
STILL AVAILABLE,

11:32.062 --> 11:33.222
I'M TELLING HIM I'M TAKING IT.

11:33.223 --> 11:34.223
NOW GIVE ME YOUR CREDIT CARD.

11:34.224 --> 11:35.725
WHAT FOR?

11:35.726 --> 11:37.066
OH, I'M STILL PUTTING
UP THE SOLAR PANELS.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.068
A GOOD IDEA'S A GOOD IDEA.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.932
NO MYSTERY GIRL.

11:42.933 --> 11:43.933
I'VE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH

11:43.934 --> 11:46.736
ALL 853 OF ZANDER'S
FACEBOOK FRIENDS.

11:46.737 --> 11:48.077
NOW I'M CHECKING
FRIENDS OF FRIENDS.

11:48.078 --> 11:51.010
THAT'S ANOTHER LIKE
600,000 PEOPLE.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.212
I MAY HAVE TO SKIP P.E.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.284
YOU ARE HANDLING THIS SO WELL.

11:55.285 --> 11:58.948
IT'S LIKE JEALOUSY HAS
GIVEN YOU SUPER STRENGTH.

11:58.949 --> 12:02.291
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I CAN'T FIND HER

12:02.292 --> 12:04.453
BECAUSE HE MADE HER UP.
I MEAN, HE'S AN ARTIST.

12:04.454 --> 12:06.095
THEY MAKE STUFF UP ALL THE TIME.

12:06.096 --> 12:08.397
MAYBE, BUT YOU'LL
NEVER KNOW FOR SURE

12:08.398 --> 12:10.029
UNLESS YOU ASK HIM.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.932
HEY, GUYS, DID YOU HAPPEN
TO SEE MY SKETCH BOOK?

12:12.933 --> 12:14.263
I THINK I LEFT IT AROUND HERE.

12:14.264 --> 12:17.037
AH, THERE IT IS. THANK GOD.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.010
YOU DIDN'T LOOK INSIDE, DID YOU?

12:21.812 --> 12:22.942
WHAT FOR?

12:22.943 --> 12:24.944
I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW
WHAT'S INSIDE OF IT.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.345
PICTURES OF ME, RIGHT?

12:26.346 --> 12:27.978
YEAH. YEAH.

12:29.019 --> 12:31.020
YES.

12:31.021 --> 12:32.952
YOU KNOW, IT MUST BE
BORING JUST DRAWING ME.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.824
YOU PROBABLY WANT TO
DRAW SOMETHING ELSE

12:34.825 --> 12:35.985
EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE, DON'T YOU?

12:35.986 --> 12:37.827
NOPE.

12:37.828 --> 12:39.088
NO, NOT THIS GUY.

12:39.089 --> 12:40.459
IN FACT, I'M GONNA
GO HOME AND DRAW YOU

12:40.460 --> 12:41.992
RIGHT NOW.

12:43.493 --> 12:44.534
FROM MEMORY.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.938
HE TOTALLY DID NOT MAKE HER UP.

12:48.939 --> 12:51.942
SHE'S AS REAL AS THE GUILTY LOOK
ON HIS ADORABLE LITTLE FACE.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.806
SO THE BUCHWALDS SAID I
COULD START OVER THERE

12:56.807 --> 12:59.148
PART TIME DURING THE DAY WHEN IT'S
QUIET HERE LOOKING AFTER THE KIDS,

12:59.149 --> 13:00.980
AND I CAN SLOWLY
TRANSITION INTO FULL TIME.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.082
I DON'T ACCEPT THIS. YOU
CAN'T JUST UP AND LEAVE.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.915
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME AT
LEAST TWO YEARS NOTICE.

13:05.916 --> 13:07.356
TWO YEARS?

13:07.357 --> 13:10.019
LOOK, THERE ARE THINGS
I'LL MISS IF YOU GO.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.221
- LIKE WHAT?
- EVERYTHING. I DON'T KNOW.

13:12.222 --> 13:14.293
- ( cellphone ringing )
- SHUT UP.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.826
LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING
THINK ABOUT IT

13:16.827 --> 13:18.397
AND THEN DECIDE TO
STAY RIGHT HERE.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.870
BURKE, I ALREADY
TOLD THE BUCHWALDS

13:20.871 --> 13:22.301
THAT I WOULD START LOOKING AFTER
THEIR LITTLE BABY TOMORROW.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.304
A BABY? DO YOU HOW
SELFISH BABIES ARE?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.976
- ( phone rings )
- ( groans )

13:26.977 --> 13:28.307
LEAVE US ALONE.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.979
I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF AN
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.480
COME ON. IT'S NOT
GONNA BE THAT BAD.

13:31.481 --> 13:33.812
SERIOUSLY, WHAT DO YOU NEED
ME FOR AROUND HERE ANYMORE?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.814
- ( cellphone rings )
- TELL THEM TO GO AWAY.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.186
OH, IT'S THE SCHOOL.

13:37.187 --> 13:39.818
THIS IS JOE LONGO.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.120
YEAH, HOLD ON A SECOND.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.092
EVERYBODY'S OKAY, BUT
THEY NEED TO SPEAK

13:43.093 --> 13:45.995
- WITH RYDER'S GUARDIAN.
- THIS IS MEL BURKE.

13:45.996 --> 13:47.557
UH-HUH.

13:48.828 --> 13:49.960
SMOKING POT?

13:51.031 --> 13:52.902
BETTER BE THIS KIND.

13:52.903 --> 13:54.964
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

13:54.965 --> 13:56.835
ALL RIGHT. JOEY,
YOU'RE GOING WITH ME.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.237
- AND YOU'RE DRIVING.
- HOW COME?

13:58.238 --> 14:00.039
'CAUSE IT'S WRONG
TO DRINK AND DRIVE.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.310
WAIT WAIT WAIT.

14:01.311 --> 14:02.842
OUT OUT. LET'S GO.

14:06.116 --> 14:07.116
SO THE VICE PRINCIPAL
BROUGHT OUR WHOLE GROUP IN

14:07.117 --> 14:09.178
ONE-BY-ONE AND ASKED
US WHO SMOKED.

14:09.179 --> 14:10.980
THERE WERE FIVE
OF US WHO DID IT,

14:10.981 --> 14:12.521
BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO TOLD THE TRUTH,

14:12.522 --> 14:14.183
SO I'M THE ONLY ONE IN TROUBLE.

14:14.184 --> 14:17.326
HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID TO
SMOKE POT ON A SCHOOL TRIP?

14:17.327 --> 14:19.890
HOW COULD YOU BE SO STUPID TO
BE THE ONLY ONE TO ADMIT IT?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.163
THAT'S NICE, BURKE. WAY
TO INSTILL VALUES.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.295
YEAH, I'M TRYING TO
INSTILL COMMON SENSE.

14:26.296 --> 14:27.167
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ADMIT TO STUFF,

14:27.168 --> 14:28.538
WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE
THE GOODS ON YOU.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.270
CAN YOU FIND THE POLITICIAN
IN THE ROOM, ANYONE?

14:31.271 --> 14:34.173
OH, FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING
SURVIVAL INSTINCTS.

14:34.174 --> 14:35.304
YOU GUYS,

14:35.305 --> 14:36.645
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
FOCUSING ON RYDER

14:36.646 --> 14:38.207
AND HOW HE'S DEALING
WITH ALL OF THIS?

14:38.208 --> 14:39.979
NO NO. LET THEM GO
AFTER EACH OTHER.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.051
NO NEED TO FOCUS ON ME.

14:42.052 --> 14:44.054
OH NO NO. THE FOCUS
IS ON YOU, SNOOP.

14:45.515 --> 14:47.116
SAYS HERE THERE'S A
DISCIPLINARY HEARING

14:47.117 --> 14:49.288
FOR RYDER AND HIS PARENTS
SLASH GUARDIANS TOMORROW.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.389
THIS IS SO BOGUS.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.321
IT WAS JOSH WHO
BROUGHT THE WEED.

14:52.322 --> 14:54.323
I NEVER EVEN SMOKED BEFORE.

14:54.324 --> 14:57.026
I JUST FIGURED WHAT'S
THE HARM IN TRYING IT?

14:57.027 --> 14:59.028
OH, SO YOUR JUDGMENT WAS WORSE

14:59.029 --> 15:01.270
BEFORE YOU SMOKED POT?

15:01.271 --> 15:02.901
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

15:02.902 --> 15:04.374
THE MEETING'S TOMORROW AT 4:20.

15:07.337 --> 15:09.238
I HAVE TO MOVE SOME
STUFF, BUT I'LL BE THERE.

15:09.239 --> 15:11.110
I WISH I COULD BE THERE, BUT
UNFORTUNATELY I ALREADY TOLD

15:11.111 --> 15:13.012
THE BUCHWALDS I'D WATCH THEIR
SIX-MONTH-OLD BABY TOMORROW.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.384
DIDN'T EVEN GET HIGH...

15:16.016 --> 15:17.516
UNLESS THIS IS ALL
A HALLUCINATION

15:17.517 --> 15:19.689
AND I'M STILL ON
THE CAMPING TRIP.

15:21.051 --> 15:22.392
WELCOME HOME, PUFF DADDY.

15:24.454 --> 15:26.555
FRIENDS OF FRIENDS OF FRIENDS.

15:26.556 --> 15:28.597
( groans ) I HAVE
LOOKED AT SO MANY FACES

15:28.598 --> 15:31.260
ALL WHITE PEOPLE
LOOK THE SAME TO ME.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.532
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN KEEP DOING THIS.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.264
MY THUMBS ARE CRAMPING.

15:35.265 --> 15:36.365
OH, SUCK IT UP, NOELLE.

15:36.366 --> 15:39.068
THIS GIRL ISN'T
GONNA FIND HERSELF.

15:39.069 --> 15:41.510
LENNOX, I DON'T
THINK SHE EXISTS.

15:41.511 --> 15:44.344
MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT AND SHE'S
JUST A PICTURE IN A NOTEBOOK.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.176
YEAH. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:47.177 --> 15:49.518
I'M REALLY JUST
DRIVING MYSELF CRAZY

15:49.519 --> 15:50.619
FOR NOTHING.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.051
REFILL?

15:52.052 --> 15:53.122
NO THANKS, WE'RE DONE.

15:53.123 --> 15:54.554
COMPLETELY DONE.

15:58.628 --> 15:59.658
( gasps )

15:59.659 --> 16:01.261
( gasps )

16:02.662 --> 16:05.335
DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE
YOU WITH THE COFFEE.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.372
YOU LOOK SO NICE, AUNT MEL.

16:13.373 --> 16:15.204
SAVE IT.

16:15.205 --> 16:17.176
BUT THANKS. THIS
IS A NEW BLAZER.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.178
RYDER, WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.209
YOU'RE MRS. SCANLON?

16:20.210 --> 16:22.051
NO, I'M HIS AUNT, MEL BURKE.

16:22.052 --> 16:24.353
HIS MOTHER AND FATHER
AREN'T AVAILABLE.

16:24.354 --> 16:25.384
SO IT'S JUST YOU?

16:25.385 --> 16:26.485
YEP, IT'S JUST ME.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.017
I MADE IT. FANTASTIC.

16:28.018 --> 16:29.218
JOE.

16:29.219 --> 16:30.619
YOU'RE HERE. I THOUGHT
YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T...

16:30.620 --> 16:32.461
YEAH WELL, I FIGURED THIS WAS
A FIRE-EXTINGUISHER MOMENT

16:32.462 --> 16:33.462
IF THERE EVER WAS ONE, RIGHT?

16:33.463 --> 16:34.523
I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

16:34.524 --> 16:36.195
- AND YOU ARE?
- OH, JOE LONGO.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.527
HI. YEAH. TUCKER BUCHWALD.

16:38.528 --> 16:40.329
JOE'S A VERY BIG PART OF THIS.

16:40.330 --> 16:42.331
I'M A BIG PART.

16:42.332 --> 16:44.103
ALL RIGHT. COME IN.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.076
RYDER, ARE YOU READY?

16:47.077 --> 16:48.407
- BURKE, YOU FEELING GOOD?
- BETTER NOW.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.739
OKAY, LET'S ROLL.

16:53.213 --> 16:56.085
ZANDER, I'M THINKING
ABOUT DYING MY HAIR.

16:56.086 --> 16:57.646
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
BETTER AS A BRUNETTE?

16:57.647 --> 17:00.049
I'D LIKE YOU BETTER
THE WAY YOU ARE.

17:00.050 --> 17:01.450
OH, REALLY?

17:01.451 --> 17:03.623
SO YOU WOULDN'T LIKE ME
BETTER IF I LOOKED LIKE THIS?

17:04.724 --> 17:05.724
OH BOY.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.356
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HER?

17:07.357 --> 17:09.128
IT'S NOTHING. I PROMISE.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.559
ZANDER, YOU DON'T HIDE NOTHING.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.261
LOOK, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HER NAME.

17:12.262 --> 17:13.532
I JUST SIT AT THE COFFEE SHOP

17:13.533 --> 17:15.064
AND I DRAW HER WHEN
SHE'S NOT LOOKING.

17:15.065 --> 17:16.535
OH, THAT'S NOT TOO CREEPY.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.607
THAT MAKES ME FEEL MUCH BETTER.

17:18.608 --> 17:21.110
WHY ARE YOU DRAWING
ANOTHER GIRL?

17:21.111 --> 17:23.372
BECAUSE I CAN TOTALLY
CAPTURE HER ON PAPER.

17:23.373 --> 17:25.214
I GOT HER, RIGHT?

17:25.215 --> 17:26.545
TOTALLY.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.217
WHEREAS I CAN NEVER GET YOU.

17:28.218 --> 17:30.149
I DRAW YOU AND I DRAW YOU,

17:30.150 --> 17:31.220
AND I NEVER EVEN COME CLOSE.

17:31.221 --> 17:33.282
IT'S JUST SO... IT'S
SO FRUSTRATING.

17:33.283 --> 17:35.224
SO I WENT OFF AND I FOUND
A GIRL THAT WAS EASIER.

17:35.225 --> 17:37.127
WHAT?

17:38.228 --> 17:39.429
SIMPLER TO DRAW.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.730
YOU'RE JUST...

17:41.731 --> 17:43.192
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

17:43.193 --> 17:45.364
I CAN NEVER GET
IT DOWN ON PAPER.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.566
YOU COULD HAVE JUST TOLD ME.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.798
I THOUGHT YOU'D GET JEALOUS.

17:49.799 --> 17:50.839
ME?

17:50.840 --> 17:53.543
( laughing ) THAT'S CRAZY.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.545
YEAH, I GUESS. WELL, I PROMISE

17:56.546 --> 17:57.546
I WON'T DRAW HER ANYMORE.

17:57.547 --> 18:00.209
NO. DRAW WHATEVER YOU LIKE,

18:00.210 --> 18:02.211
WHATEVER INSPIRES YOU.

18:02.212 --> 18:03.382
JUST NOT GIRLS.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.115
- I LEAVE THAT UP TO YOU.
- UNDERSTOOD.

18:08.288 --> 18:11.360
HEY, DUDE, HOW'D IT GO?
OH, TERRIFIC.

18:11.361 --> 18:13.462
I'LL BE UPSTAIRS FOR THE NEXT
FEW YEARS IF ANYBODY NEEDS ME.

18:13.463 --> 18:15.664
EXPELLED OR SUSPENDED?

18:15.665 --> 18:17.566
SUSPENDED FOR THE
REST OF THE YEAR.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.628
IT'S THEIR
ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY.

18:19.629 --> 18:20.829
MAN, THAT SUCKS.

18:20.830 --> 18:23.273
OH, YOU ARE SO SWEET.

18:24.334 --> 18:26.206
OKAY, EVERY HAPPY
PERSON HAS TO LEAVE.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.209
BUP BUP BUP BUP BUP.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.212
YOU UP, YOU OUT.

18:34.544 --> 18:37.386
THAT'S THREE MONTHS OF
THE SCHOOL YEAR AT HOME.

18:37.387 --> 18:39.218
WHAT HAPPENS TO HIS EDUCATION?

18:39.219 --> 18:41.320
GAVE US THIS LIST OF TUTORS,
WE CAN CHOOSE ONE OF THESE.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.591
OH GREAT. A BUNCH OF CHUMPS

18:42.592 --> 18:44.353
WHO COULDN'T GET A JOB
AT A PUBLIC SCHOOL.

18:44.354 --> 18:46.155
WE COULD JUST FORGET
ABOUT COLLEGE.

18:46.156 --> 18:47.426
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE HIM
DOWN TO THE STREET CORNER

18:47.427 --> 18:48.757
RIGHT NOW AND TEACH HIM HOW
TO DANCE WITH ONE OF THOSE

18:48.758 --> 18:51.530
"APARTMENT FOR RENT" SIGNS.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.562
THESE ARE ALL HIGHLY TRAINED
PROFESSIONALS, MEL.

18:53.563 --> 18:55.364
ALL RIGHT? WE'LL
JUST PICK A NAME.

18:55.365 --> 18:56.565
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:56.566 --> 18:58.767
I'M NOT USING ANYBODY
ON THAT LIST.

18:58.768 --> 19:01.870
'CAUSE AS IT HAPPENS, I KNOW
THE BEST TUTOR AVAILABLE.

19:01.871 --> 19:04.213
YEAH? YOU GOT A
RESUME FOR THE GUY?

19:04.214 --> 19:05.315
( cellphone ringing )

19:08.548 --> 19:11.149
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- COME ON, JOE.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.921
I'M NOT PLAYING THIS.
THIS IS A SILLY GAME.

19:12.922 --> 19:14.383
I'M NOT... WE COULD JUST...
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

19:14.384 --> 19:16.455
- WE CAN... HELLO?
- ( beeps )

19:16.456 --> 19:19.328
YOU ARE THE WORLD'S GREATEST
EXPERT AT EVERYTHING.

19:19.329 --> 19:21.460
OKAY, YOU JUST MADE A REALLY GOOD POINT.
I'M LISTENING.

19:21.461 --> 19:25.294
HE NEEDS SOMEBODY, JOE.
AND WHO BETTER?

19:25.295 --> 19:26.895
YOU KNOW YOU SAID YOU
HAD NOTHING TO DO?

19:26.896 --> 19:28.897
THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING
REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO.

19:28.898 --> 19:30.769
LOOK, BURKE, I
COMMITTED TO THE...

19:30.770 --> 19:32.241
OKAY, BURKE... OKAY.

19:32.242 --> 19:33.572
BURKE, I COMMITTED
TO THE BUCHWALDS.

19:33.573 --> 19:34.903
THAT WAS NEVER GONNA
WORK OUT, OKAY?

19:34.904 --> 19:37.476
THAT SELFISH BABY WAS GONNA
SUCK UP ALL YOUR TIME.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.578
AND THIS WAY YOU
GET TO STAY HERE

19:39.579 --> 19:40.909
WITH A PROMOTION.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.751
YOU KNOW, STILL DO
ALL THE NANNY STUFF.

19:42.752 --> 19:45.414
I GET PIE. EVERYBODY'S HAPPY.

19:45.415 --> 19:47.216
( sighs )

19:47.217 --> 19:49.758
I GUESS TEACHING RYDER
HOW THE WORLD WORKS

19:49.759 --> 19:51.890
WOULD BE SLIGHTLY
MORE REWARDING THAN

19:51.891 --> 19:54.224
- CHANGING DIAPERS.
- SURE IS.

19:55.565 --> 19:57.896
WOW. JOE LONGO,

19:57.897 --> 20:00.229
ACADEMIC TUTOR, HUH?

20:00.230 --> 20:02.331
NEVER REALLY SAW THAT COMING.

20:02.332 --> 20:03.902
WELL, THAT'S THE THING
WITH THESE OLDER KIDS.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.574
YOU KNOW, THERE'S LESS
TO DO MINUTE TO MINUTE,

20:05.575 --> 20:07.236
BUT WHEN A PARENTING
MOMENT HITS,

20:07.237 --> 20:08.577
IT'S A FRIGGIN' TSUNAMI.

20:08.578 --> 20:10.239
AND WHEN IT COMES TO
DEALING WITH KIDS,

20:10.240 --> 20:11.410
THERE REALLY ISN'T
ANYONE BETTER THAN I AM.

20:11.411 --> 20:12.911
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.643
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BUCHWALD KID?

20:14.644 --> 20:16.245
THE WHAT?

20:16.246 --> 20:17.747
OH, CRAP. THE BABY.

20:19.249 --> 20:21.621
OH. I LEFT HIM ON THE PORCH.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.226
( chuckles ) HEY, BUDDY.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.900
DON'T TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD.

20:36.766 --> 20:38.437
SO IN SUMMATION, THIS
COUNTRY'S GREATNESS COMES

20:38.438 --> 20:40.469
FROM OUR WESTERN EXPANSION,
WHICH IS AN EXPRESSION

20:40.470 --> 20:42.541
OF OUR ENTREPRENEURIAL
SPIRIT CHARACTERIZED BY WHO?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.242
BUSINESSMAN, ALL RIGHT,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.745
WHO'S ACTUALLY THE REAL
HERO OF THE AMERICAN STORY.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.377
THIS IS YOUR LESSON?

20:48.378 --> 20:49.448
WHAT ABOUT THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

20:49.449 --> 20:50.549
WHO MADE ALL OF THAT POSSIBLE?

20:50.550 --> 20:51.920
( scoffs ) ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

20:51.921 --> 20:53.282
ALL THE GOVERNMENT DID
WAS GET IN OUR WAY.

20:53.283 --> 20:54.453
IF YOU GUYS ARE JUST GONNA GO...

20:54.454 --> 20:55.784
LINCOLN GOT IN THE WAY?

20:55.785 --> 20:57.756
GEORGE FREAKIN' WASHINGTON
GOT IN THE WAY?!

20:57.757 --> 20:59.588
- WHAT IF I JUST...
- WHO'S ON OUR MONEY, JOE?

20:59.589 --> 21:01.530
HENRY FORD? DONALD TRUMP?

21:01.531 --> 21:02.931
AUNT JEMIMAH?

21:02.932 --> 21:04.963
IS ANY OF THIS GONNA
BE ON THE TEST?

21:04.964 --> 21:07.296
THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE
THEY MADE THIS COUNTRY.

21:07.297 --> 21:10.339
NO, THEY MADE THIS
COUNTRY BREAKFAST.

21:10.340 --> 21:12.371
I HATE PARENT-TEACHER
CONFERENCES.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.502
THEY MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT.

21:13.503 --> 21:14.643
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE GREAT?

21:14.644 --> 21:16.044
IS IF YOU WENT ON
THE ROOF RIGHT NOW

21:16.045 --> 21:17.376
AND INSTALLED THOSE SOLAR
PANELS THAT HAVE BEEN

21:17.377 --> 21:19.308
- SITTING OUTSIDE...
- YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

21:19.309 --> 21:20.579
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW?
I'M EDUCATING.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.581
- I'M EXPANDING HIS MIND.
- EDUCATE THE ROOF.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.583
- I'M EXPANDING HIS MIND.
- GO EDUCATE THE ROOF.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.985
- I WILL EDUCATE...
- SOLAR PANELS!
