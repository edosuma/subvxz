JACK: <i>Previously on</i> This is Us...

00:03.003 --> 00:07.216
The brain MRI revealed shrinkage
in the memory centers of the brain,

00:07.299 --> 00:10.469
likely due to Alzheimer's.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.763
RANDALL: But my mother depends on me.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.849
I'm the only one who can take care of her.
It's been that way a long time.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.809
But if I'm not the one
who's taking care of her, who will?

00:18.101 --> 00:23.106
It's funny, somehow all of this bad news
has sort of freed me up.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.150
<i>Carpe diem and all that.</i>

00:25.234 --> 00:28.487
Sweetheart, please don't start
treating me any differently.

-(SQUEALS)
<i>-I need the fun. I need the laughs.</i>

00:31.448 --> 00:32.741
I need that part of you.

00:34.326 --> 00:38.455
And I also really want to go
to your movie premiere in New York.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.540
Okay.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.448
Did Randall say what he wanted
to talk to you guys about?

01:14.241 --> 01:15.993
I have no idea. No idea.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.412
I told him I'd see him tomorrow
in New York at my premiere,

01:18.495 --> 01:20.956
I'd talk to him then, and then
he said it was a code red.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.958
Last time he called a code red,
he wanted to discuss

01:23.041 --> 01:24.543
whether or not
he could pull off an earring.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.211
(CHUCKLES) That was
a short conversation.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.629
-Yeah.

-Hey.
-Hey. Listen, I know this is

01:33.677 --> 01:35.512
a, uh, Big Three-only thing.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.807
<i>I just wanted to show you</i>

01:38.891 --> 01:41.101
Aw, that's what I'm talking about.

01:41.185 --> 01:45.731
You know I'm always here
for some Jack-rassic Park.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.232

01:48.025 --> 01:49.443

01:49.526 --> 01:50.527
All right, I'm gonna go put him down.

KEVIN: <i>That's good.</i>
TOBY: <i>Bye.</i>

01:57.117 --> 01:58.535
<i>Uh, so, Randall, what's up?</i>

01:58.911 --> 02:01.121
Okay, Kev, um,

02:02.164 --> 02:04.750
the reason I'm coming to New York
for your premiere

02:04.833 --> 02:07.669
is because I need to talk to Mom
about something in person.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.671
And because you want
to support me, right?

02:09.755 --> 02:11.048
<i>-Kevin, come on.</i>
-Yeah...let him talk.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.216
All right, all right, all right.

02:13.675 --> 02:14.927
Now, allow me to preface this

02:15.010 --> 02:18.096
by telling you that I've done
a great deal of research,

02:18.180 --> 02:20.682
and I've given this
a tremendous amount of thought.

02:20.766 --> 02:23.310
<i>Uh, I'm sorry,</i>
<i>are you reading from a script?</i>

02:23.393 --> 02:24.520
<i>He's definitely reading from a script.</i>

02:24.686 --> 02:27.105
I found a clinical trial for Mom.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.359
<i>She meets all the criteria.</i>
<i>It starts next month,</i>

02:30.442 --> 02:33.028
and I would like your help
getting her on board.

02:34.780 --> 02:38.116
And you don't think all this
is a little premature?

02:38.200 --> 02:40.244
Uh, she just...got a diagnosis.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.330
<i>Yeah, and... And research shows,</i>
<i>that early intervention</i><i>is crucial.</i>

02:43.413 --> 02:45.457
Okay. Well, I mean,
what would she have to do?

02:45.541 --> 02:47.084
Becau... I can take her
to all of the appointments.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.671
Uh...it's in St. Louis.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.464
-St. Louis?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

02:52.840 --> 02:54.132
For how long?

02:54.675 --> 02:56.635
-Nine months.
-(EXHALES)

02:56.718 --> 03:00.138
It's at an excellent research hospital,
one of the best in the country.

03:00.222 --> 03:04.768
She'd get monthly intravenous infusions,
and regular memory tests and labs.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.895
<i>She can leave on the occasional</i>
<i>weekend, and we're...</i>

03:06.979 --> 03:08.272
You want to take Mom to St. Louis,

03:08.355 --> 03:10.148
for an experimental trial
for nine months?

03:10.232 --> 03:12.818
All the evidence shows that
people living with Alzheimer's,

03:12.901 --> 03:15.779
who are involved in clinical trials
do better

03:15.863 --> 03:18.448
<i>than those who aren't.</i>
<i>They receive excellent medical care</i>

03:18.532 --> 03:19.950
<i>-and attention...</i>
-Okay, ho... This is insane.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.827
This is crazy, right? This is nuts.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.581
I mean... I mean, it really is up to Mom.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.666
It is absolutely up to Mom.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.502
But Mom's gonna want
to know what we think.

03:30.586 --> 03:34.631
And I think we should be united
in the position that this is good for her.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.845
Kate, do I have your support?

03:42.431 --> 03:43.974
Yeah, I guess so.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.685
<i>Kev, you on board?</i>

03:46.768 --> 03:49.897
Uh, you know, I... I don't...

Pull her off to someplace...

03:52.858 --> 03:54.318
We don't even know
if this thing will work.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.945
And she's in a good place here,
Randall. You know?

03:57.029 --> 03:58.739
She's having fun with the baby,
she's having fun with us.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.533
Hey, Kev, I'm so glad
that you guys are connecting

04:01.658 --> 04:04.703
and having a good time,
but I've done hours and hours of research.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.539
I swear I'm halfway to medical school
at this point.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.375
This is what's best for her.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.337
I need you to trust me on this one.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.340
<i>Okay?</i>

04:20.636 --> 04:21.637
Okay.

04:25.557 --> 04:28.894
I got to go grab mom
and head to the airport.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.855
Yeah, I'm getting into the city
late morning.

04:31.939 --> 04:35.108
I can make a lunch reservation
for the three of us before your premiere.

04:35.192 --> 04:36.652
Somewhere quiet where we can talk.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.695

05:10.269 --> 05:11.854

05:11.937 --> 05:14.857
So, have each of you picked
the one activity you would like to do?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.609
Everything Kevin McCallister does
in <i>Home Alone 2.</i>

05:17.693 --> 05:20.737
Why is it even called <i>Home Alone</i>
if he's not home alone?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.739
Because <i>City Alone </i>would
sound stupid, buttmunch.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.074
Don't call your brother a buttmunch.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.201
And I said you could pick one thing,
not an entire movie's worth.

05:26.785 --> 05:28.495
Fine. A huge toy store.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.205
Like the one Kevin McCallister goes to,

05:30.289 --> 05:31.665
-obviously.
-All right. Randall?

05:31.748 --> 05:34.293
The Natural History Museum, for dioramas.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.295
-My God.
-Okay. Katie girl?

05:36.420 --> 05:39.089
I want to go to a fancy hotel
and drink tea like Eloise.

when I was a little girl.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.181
my mom and I into the city every year.

05:47.264 --> 05:50.392
He just... He had this thing about him.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.853
He made everything in the city
feel magical.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.898
Like, he knew where to
get the best steak frites,

05:55.981 --> 05:58.901
or he knew who was playing
at the Carlyle Hotel.

05:59.526 --> 06:04.907
And he used to get us
these little wax bags of hot, sugary nuts.

06:06.658 --> 06:09.786
Yeah, we used to call
New York City "Dad's city."

06:09.870 --> 06:13.207
Well, it's gonna be
our city for 24 hours.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.334
So, the kids have
all decided on one thing,

06:15.417 --> 06:17.169
they'd like to do.
Thank you very much.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.587

FAO Schwarz 1:00 to 2:00 for Kev.

10:32.549 --> 10:36.220
Then we're gonna go get tea
at a fancy hotel for Kate, 3:00.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.472
Followed up by 4:30 at the Met for Mom.

10:38.555 --> 10:42.184
All right, and we got to remember,
it closes early on Sundays.

10:43.101 --> 10:47.147
CONDUCTOR: <i>Arriving,</i>
<i>Lexington Avenue-63rd Street.</i>

10:48.857 --> 10:50.317
-Okay, guys. I think this is our stop.
-Oh, no, no.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.278
-Not yet. Not yet.
-I'm sure we have to get out here.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.530
-We transfer to the...
-No, I checked the map.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.698
No, the map... The map has an orange line
that goes up to 81st Street.

10:56.782 --> 10:58.158
No, it's... It's a couple more stops.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.243
-Oh...
-Babe, look, I got it.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.787
-Okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.838
Hey, you never said
what activity you want to do.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.841
That's because I haven't
decided yet, Katie girl.

11:13.924 --> 11:17.511
CONDUCTOR: <i>57th and Lexington is closed.</i>

11:17.594 --> 11:20.180
-Wait, what?
<i>-Next stop, Roosevelt Island.</i>

11:20.264 --> 11:21.598
We're going to another island?

11:21.932 --> 11:23.684
No. No.

11:23.767 --> 11:27.729
Yeah, the B train goes to Queens
on the weekend, so...

11:28.772 --> 11:30.691
we're going to Queens.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.784
KEVIN: I don't know
what the hell I'm working for.

11:42.327 --> 11:47.541
Sometimes I sit in my apartment all alone
and I think of the rent I'm paying.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.919
And it's crazy.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.175
But then, it's what I always wanted.

11:57.259 --> 12:00.929
My own apartment, a car,
and plenty of women.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.601
And still, God damn it, I'm lonely.

12:09.271 --> 12:10.898
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

12:11.440 --> 12:12.774
-You ran scenes with him?
-Yes.

12:12.858 --> 12:13.984
-Oh.
-Hey.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.278
-There he is.
-(CHUCKLES)

12:16.361 --> 12:18.780
Oh, sweetheart, you were so good.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.825
I really believed that
you were Willy Loman's son.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.160
And it broke my heart.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.495
Wait, you weren't really smoking
up there, though, were you?

12:25.579 --> 12:27.122
-No, of course not.
-'Cause... Okay, good.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.666
-So good. So good.
-Hey.

12:29.750 --> 12:30.751
(SOPHIE CHUCKLES)

12:32.920 --> 12:34.588
Randall, what'd you think?

12:34.671 --> 12:36.882
It was cool.
(CHUCKLING) I... I liked it.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.927
-Yeah.
-You were awesome.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.179
-Oh, thank you so much.
-It was... It was so...

12:42.262 --> 12:43.430
-Thank you.
-...real.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.599
Yeah, it's, um, all my acting teacher.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.267
Seriously, he's incredible.

12:47.643 --> 12:50.062
He's teaching me to be present.
It's the Meisner Technique.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.231
-It's awesome. Hey, Kirby.
-REBECCA: Oh.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.482
(INAUDIBLE)

12:57.986 --> 13:00.072
Hey, so this is my family.
This is my mother Rebecca.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.406
-Hi, Rebecca.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

13:01.490 --> 13:02.741
-This is my brother Randall.
-Hi, Randall.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.368
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-His girlfriend Beth.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.661
-Hi, Beth.
-And you know Sophie.

13:05.744 --> 13:06.745
Of course.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.997
-(CHUCKLES)
-I'm so glad you got to see the show.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.416
Your son is very talented.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.253
Thank you. Thank you so much.

13:14.336 --> 13:16.547
Well, thank you for all
the work you're doing with him.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.591
Mmm. Uh, and you're visiting
from Pittsburgh, right?

13:19.675 --> 13:22.219
-Yeah.
-New York is a bit different, I assume?

13:22.302 --> 13:25.347
(LAUGHS) Yes, it's very different.

13:25.430 --> 13:29.685
You guys have tall buildings,
we put fries on our sandwiches.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.645
-Mmm. That's one point for Pittsburgh.
-Mmm-hmm.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.855
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

13:32.938 --> 13:33.939
Yes.

13:34.356 --> 13:37.150
Hey, Kirby, are you coming out?
Everybody's going.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.444
Uh, yeah. I think
I'm gonna try and stop by.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.780
-Great.
-It was nice to meet you all.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.740
Nice to meet you. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

13:57.337 --> 14:01.300
Oh, Kev, this dress is just beautiful.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.594
-It's not too much, though?
-No.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.262
No, no, no. I think it's just right.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.306
-Yeah?
-It's perfect.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.517
Wow. Watch out, Helen Mirren.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.478
Oh, stop it.
You know she's my spirit animal.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.856
-She's everybody's spirit animal.
-(LAUGHS)

14:17.441 --> 14:19.776
-Hmm. Hey, Kev?
-Mmm-hmm?

14:20.194 --> 14:22.654
-I've a silly question for you.
-Yeah.

14:22.821 --> 14:26.074
(SIGHS) I'm embarrassed to ask.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.410
-What? No, come on, Mom, ask.
-(SIGHS)

14:29.870 --> 14:31.622
Can I walk the red carpet
with you tonight?

14:32.206 --> 14:35.417
I know I tell you I never want
to do that sort of stuff,

14:35.501 --> 14:38.754
but I just feel like
it would be a shame to waste this dress.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.297
-Well, yes. Yes, of course.
-Yeah?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.507
-Yes, of course. That'd be great.
-Ah!

14:41.590 --> 14:43.258
Thank you. I'm... I'm so excited.

14:43.342 --> 14:44.718
I never get to do this sort of thing.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.303
-Thank you.
-Yeah, of course.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.387
(DOORBELL RINGS)

14:47.930 --> 14:50.224
-I'll get that. Grab that.
-Okay.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.563
-Hey.
-Hey, brother.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.233
-Congratulations.
-Ah, thank you. Mom's in here.

-Mom.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.951
-You look stunning.
-You think so? Thank you.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.994
Like a younger Helen Mirren.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.288
-Oh, a younger Helen Mirren.
-Oh. That's even better.

15:13.372 --> 15:15.415
-You're good. (LAUGHS)
-Wow.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.167
You guys almost ready for lunch?

15:17.251 --> 15:18.961
I made reservations for us at Sarabeth's.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.380
(GASPS) Yes. Um,
I'm gonna go change real quick.

15:22.339 --> 15:23.382
All right.

15:23.841 --> 15:25.050
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:29.304 --> 15:31.056
I don't think we should talk
to her about this today.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.183
No.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.894
No, don't do this to me, man.
We agreed.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.855
All right?
The trial only has so many slots.

15:37.938 --> 15:38.939
We don't want to waste time

15:39.022 --> 15:40.774
-with indecision.
-It's the weekend.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.609
Today, tomorrow, Randall,
it's not gonna matter, okay?

15:42.693 --> 15:44.987
-(SIGHS)
-Spend the night.

15:45.904 --> 15:47.322
We'll have breakfast,
we'll talk to her about this

15:47.406 --> 15:49.199
first thing tomorrow, okay?

15:49.783 --> 15:51.493
(CHUCKLES) She's so happy right now.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.371
You know, let her have one great day.

-Okay.
-(WHISPERS) Thank you.

16:00.836 --> 16:01.837
Thank you.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.715
Hey, Mom, you know,
we didn't talk about clutches.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.426
I'm thinking silver...
Ooh, how about this one?

16:07.509 --> 16:08.927
(FADING) This is a...

16:16.351 --> 16:18.854
I can't believe we're actually
lost in New York.

16:18.937 --> 16:23.150
I just need to meet a weird pigeon lady
and I'll practically be Macaulay Culkin.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.569
Kev, we're not lost in New York.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.112
We are lost in Queens.

16:27.738 --> 16:29.364
Hey, guys, I think we have to head

16:29.448 --> 16:31.283
-a couple blocks down that way.
-No. That's not right.

16:31.366 --> 16:35.037
We... We got to keep going down to 23rd,
and then hop on the F train.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.289
That's gonna take us
right back into Manhattan.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.666
Can I talk to you for one second, Jack?

16:40.125 --> 16:42.503
Hey, guys, stay where I can see you.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.505
KATE: What's going on with them?

16:45.088 --> 16:48.133
I think Mom's upset because we're lost.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.595
It'll be fine. Dad can fix it.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.765
-JACK: Yeah.
-So, you realize that we are walking

16:54.848 --> 16:57.309
away from the East River,
we keep heading east.

16:57.726 --> 17:01.104
And the E train is about
two blocks south that way.

17:01.188 --> 17:02.940
It'll take us all the way to 50th Street.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.484
And then once we get there,
we can transfer to the C train.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.694
It'll be a lot faster.

17:07.778 --> 17:08.946
O... Okay.

17:09.029 --> 17:11.573
-Yeah, okay.
-It's... It's okay.

17:11.657 --> 17:12.783
It's a big city.

17:13.325 --> 17:16.203
It's a city that I happen
to have been to before, so,

17:16.286 --> 17:18.872
I don't know, maybe you could
act like I maybe know

17:18.956 --> 17:20.624
-what I'm talking about?
-Sorry.

17:21.083 --> 17:24.461
Hey. What's going on with you?

17:26.797 --> 17:28.173
Look, you...

17:29.049 --> 17:33.136
You kept talking about
going into the city with your dad

17:33.220 --> 17:34.596
when you were a kid, and, uh...

17:34.680 --> 17:39.309
He... He sounded so fancy
and cosmopolitan.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.395
And I... I'm a grown man,
and this is the first time

17:41.478 --> 17:44.231
I'm... I'm actually in New York City.

17:44.314 --> 17:48.110
You know, I'm not the guy who knows
where the best steaks are

17:48.193 --> 17:50.237
or knows what the hell the Carlyle is.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.530
I... (STUTTERS)

17:53.490 --> 17:56.660
Jack, yeah, my dad definitely
knew his way around the city.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.453
That's... That's true.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.748
But do you know
what he also knew how to do?

18:02.499 --> 18:06.003
He knew how to throw a screaming fit
when he couldn't find a parking spot.

18:06.879 --> 18:08.130
He also knew... (CHUCKLES)

18:08.213 --> 18:10.591
How to stress my mom out
so much that she had

18:10.674 --> 18:12.801
a four-martini lunch
and then got us kicked out

18:12.885 --> 18:14.803
of <i>Anything Goes</i> for pushing an usher.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.471
Wow, that actually happened?

18:16.555 --> 18:19.308
Babe, I don't... I don't want those trips.

18:19.391 --> 18:23.395
I want our trip,
with my lost husband and all.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.148
(STUTTERS) Yeah, your lost husband
that cost us, what?

18:26.231 --> 18:27.941
-Two hours?
-That's okay.

18:28.025 --> 18:29.818
No, no, no, we're fine.
We can still hit up

18:29.902 --> 18:31.195
everybody's, uh, must-see spots.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.655
But we do need to get them fed
'cause they're gonna

18:33.780 --> 18:34.990
-start melting down.
-Hey.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.534
Oh. Do pretzels?

18:37.618 --> 18:39.369
Yeah. Okay... Hey, guys,
change of plans.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.246
Who wants a pretzel?

18:41.330 --> 18:42.748
-Me.
-Yes.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.958
See? I told you he'd fix it.

18:45.042 --> 18:46.168
JACK: Um...

18:47.085 --> 18:48.378
Gonna get five pretzels.

18:48.462 --> 18:50.672
And, hey, don't even think
about not having mustard.

18:50.756 --> 18:53.425
No kids of mine are gonna have
a pretzels without mustard.

18:53.717 --> 18:57.054
Can we get the, uh,
cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza,

18:57.137 --> 18:59.681
buffalo wings, and mozzarella sticks?
And that should be good for everyone?

18:59.765 --> 19:01.558
Uh, Mom... Mom doesn't like that stuff.

19:01.642 --> 19:02.893
Maybe we should go with some salad

19:02.976 --> 19:04.269
-and some other healthy stuff.
-No, no.

19:04.353 --> 19:05.938
I'm fine, Randall. We're on vacation.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.481
Come on. We're good.

19:07.564 --> 19:08.857
Thank you.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.652
So, tell us about life in New York.

19:11.735 --> 19:13.487
Oh, NYU is so much fun.

19:13.570 --> 19:17.282
And I'm so happy that Kevin has found
the right place to study his craft.

19:17.366 --> 19:18.700
REBECCA: Mmm.

-We got a seat for you.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.588
Oh, thank you.

19:31.672 --> 19:33.549
God, this place makes me feel so old.

19:33.632 --> 19:35.759
Oh, tell me about it. (CHUCKLES)

19:35.843 --> 19:37.427
Kirby used to play here back in the day.

19:37.511 --> 19:39.930
-He was a pretty famous musician.
-Really?

19:40.013 --> 19:41.348
(CHUCKLES) No. No, no, no.

19:41.431 --> 19:42.891
Your son is being very generous.

19:42.975 --> 19:47.521
I... I was in an
REO Speedwagon cover band,

19:47.604 --> 19:49.773
and we had a small but loyal following.

19:49.857 --> 19:51.608
-Oh.
-So, you can laugh.

19:52.276 --> 19:54.027
I would never.

19:54.528 --> 19:56.488
Sometimes you just
can't fight the feeling.

19:56.572 --> 19:58.031
(LAUGHS)

19:58.949 --> 20:00.576
(LAUGHS) I had to.

20:00.659 --> 20:02.244
KIRBY: That's great.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.162
You know, my mom used to be a singer.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.873
-Mmm-hmm.
-She's really good.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.666
When she was young,
she went to L.A. to make it...

20:07.749 --> 20:09.877
Uh, I mean younger.
She's still young.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.295
Okay. Thank you.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.088
-KEVIN: Still young.
-Okay. Yeah.

20:13.172 --> 20:15.257
No, he's right. I did.
I did go out to L.A.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.718
I wanted to be Joni Mitchell.

20:17.801 --> 20:21.054
I get that. I kind of wanted
to be Joni Mitchell, also,

20:21.138 --> 20:24.349
but I think you probably
had more of a... A shot.

20:24.433 --> 20:26.935
You got that... That thing, I can tell.

20:33.192 --> 20:35.736
Uh, you know what?
This is gonna sound really strange,

20:35.819 --> 20:37.946
but I have been wanting to go the Met,

20:38.030 --> 20:39.740
-and I think I'm gonna go right now.
-Really?

20:39.823 --> 20:41.408
-Right now?
-REBECCA: Yeah.

20:41.491 --> 20:42.743
Uh, they're open late
on Saturdays, so, um...

20:42.826 --> 20:44.745
Uh, Beth and I could come with.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.206
No, no, no, no, no.
Sweetheart, it's absolutely fine.

20:47.289 --> 20:50.501
You guys stay and have fun.
I'll be back at 6:15 or 6:30.

-Nice to meet you.

Well, I'm gonna go say hi to, uh,

21:00.677 --> 21:02.054

Great job today.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.222
Oh. Thanks.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.932
-(QUIETLY) Nice to meet you guys.
-SOPHIE: Bye.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.683
Were you trying to set Mom up
with that guy?

21:07.809 --> 21:08.810
Maybe.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.688
I hope she's okay by herself.
Maybe I should I go after her.

21:11.772 --> 21:14.107
My God, Randall, she's a grown woman.

21:14.191 --> 21:16.693
You're gonna spend the rest of
your life worrying about Mom?

Let's keep moving, all right?

22:24.595 --> 22:25.929
We've got a lot of stops to make.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.515

was supposed to just be tea?

Shh. Come on. Look at
how much fun they're having.

22:44.364 --> 22:47.576
Is it me, or is Kevin weirdly comfortable
at a fancy hotel?

22:47.659 --> 22:49.661
Hey, guys, why don't you
finish up, okay?

22:49.745 --> 22:51.038
It's getting late.
I want to get over to Mom's museum.

It's okay, guys. It's fine.

We had a fun day, right?
We can, uh, skip the Met.

23:00.005 --> 23:01.381

23:01.465 --> 23:05.093
Well, you know what?
I care. Okay?

23:05.844 --> 23:08.096
How about, you get to the museum,

23:08.180 --> 23:10.265
I'm gonna finish up with these maniacs,
get 'em back to the hotel,

I've been trying to get a cab
for 20 minutes.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.294
I... Is there some sort of secret
that I don't know?

23:39.378 --> 23:41.380
Or do I just scream "tourist," or...

23:41.463 --> 23:43.841
No, no, no. No fannypack, no camera.

his "pretty for a mom" mom

24:06.113 --> 24:08.949
Well, I'm sorry
if I came across uncomfortable.

-Oh, no.
-I, um...

24:10.325 --> 24:12.828
I'm sure Kevin's
probably told you, but, uh...

24:13.495 --> 24:15.914
My husband died
a little over a year ago,

24:15.998 --> 24:20.419
and I, um... My kids were right there,
and I... I don't know...

24:20.502 --> 24:24.631
Does... Does this thing
ever start to feel more comfortable?

24:27.217 --> 24:28.218
Uh...

24:28.677 --> 24:31.972
I don't know, and it doesn't compare...

24:32.890 --> 24:35.601
Uh, but a year after my divorce,

24:35.684 --> 24:38.770
I... I took my daughters out
to lunch to let them know

24:38.854 --> 24:40.439
that I might start dating again.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.857
And how did they react?

24:43.483 --> 24:44.484
Not great.

24:44.568 --> 24:47.988
(CHUCKLING) The little one
literally covered her ears

24:48.071 --> 24:50.616
with the two halves
of her peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

24:50.699 --> 24:52.784
and the older one looked at me
very seriously and said,

24:52.868 --> 24:54.828
"Dad, is this necessary at your age?"

24:54.912 --> 24:58.832
(LAUGHS) But, see, I...
I can understand

24:58.916 --> 25:00.584
where your daughter is coming from,
in a way.

25:00.667 --> 25:04.046
I... I had love, you know?

25:04.129 --> 25:05.964
And now I have my kids.

25:06.048 --> 25:08.300
And maybe from now on...

25:09.009 --> 25:10.594
Maybe that's enough.

25:12.804 --> 25:15.224
-Well, this is your spot, so...
-Oh.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.309
And, uh, you should check out
the Burchfield exhibit.

25:17.392 --> 25:18.560
You won't want to miss that.

25:19.228 --> 25:20.354

Hey.

25:25.776 --> 25:27.528
Do you want to come with me?

25:28.320 --> 25:29.321
I'd love to.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.741
Uh, but let's... Let's not take a cab,

25:32.824 --> 25:34.952
let's walk through the park.
It's much prettier.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.829
Yeah, that sounds fun. This way?

25:37.913 --> 25:39.206
-Yes, this way.
-Okay.

REBECCA: Ooh, it's cold.

25:43.335 --> 25:45.337
I can't believe you thought
Mom would like that guy.

25:45.754 --> 25:48.507
Why wouldn't she?
Kirby's a great guy.

25:48.590 --> 25:52.427
It doesn't matter what Kirby's like.
Dad died a year ago.

25:52.511 --> 25:54.054
Mom definitely isn't ready to date.

25:54.137 --> 25:56.139
Who made you the decider
of whether or not she's ready?

25:56.223 --> 25:57.891
Because I actually see her.

25:57.975 --> 25:59.768
I didn't abandon her
to traipse around New York

25:59.852 --> 26:01.728

When's the last time
you ever called her, Kevin?

26:04.523 --> 26:06.191
And I'm not talking about
when you call her

26:06.275 --> 26:08.110
to ask for money for
your ridiculous acting class.

26:08.193 --> 26:11.196
Mom can't spend the rest of her life
being sad about Dad.

26:11.280 --> 26:12.823
She deserves to have some fun.

it would take nine months.

could visit you every week, if you like.

Well, I... I think that he...
I... I got a little confused,

30:11.812 --> 30:14.022
and Randall just wanted
to try to make me feel better,

30:14.106 --> 30:16.108
-that's all.
-Or he was trying to find an excuse

30:16.191 --> 30:17.192
to push forward his agenda.
