02:09.239 --> 02:11.162
Have a good evening.

02:15.679 --> 02:17.602
Taxi!

02:38.279 --> 02:40.202
Thank you, Jack.

02:41.399 --> 02:43.209
Not much going on for a Friday.

02:43.359 --> 02:45.886
Eh, it's early yet.

02:53.519 --> 02:55.284
Say, Cal, make that a double,
would you?

02:55.440 --> 02:57.328
Sure.

02:57.519 --> 02:58.851
What, are you in
a hurry tonight?

03:00.560 --> 03:02.163
And, uh, one for yourself, huh?

03:02.359 --> 03:04.249
- I got to make a call.
- Oh, thanks, pal.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.331
Therese?

03:21.480 --> 03:23.209
Is that you?

03:23.359 --> 03:25.282
What do you know?

03:27.079 --> 03:29.082
I'm-I'm saying to myself,
I know that girl.

03:29.239 --> 03:31.971
- Jack.
- Gee, it's great to see you, Therese.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.963
It's been... months.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.644
Months.

03:35.799 --> 03:38.279
- Jack, this is Carol Aird.
- Ah.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.282
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.130
Well, uh, hey, uh,

03:42.279 --> 03:44.487
Ted Gray is meeting me here,
and a bunch of us

03:44.639 --> 03:45.686
are heading
down to Phil's party.

03:45.839 --> 03:47.171
You're going, aren't you?

03:47.359 --> 03:49.010
Yes, I just planned
to get there a little bit...

03:49.160 --> 03:50.490
You two go ahead.

03:50.639 --> 03:51.686
You coming along?

03:51.839 --> 03:53.204
No.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.043
I, uh, have to make
a few calls

03:55.239 --> 03:56.889
before dinner anyway.

03:57.079 --> 03:58.730
I really should run.

03:58.880 --> 04:00.530
Are you sure?

04:00.679 --> 04:02.808
Of course.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.685
Well, then it would be great
to catch a ride.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.608
Yeah, sure.

04:10.799 --> 04:12.802
You two have a wonderful night.

04:12.959 --> 04:15.167
Nice meeting you, Jack.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.368
Nice meeting you.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.010
All right, well, uh,

04:22.159 --> 04:25.243
let me go make sure
the loaf's on his way.

04:25.440 --> 04:27.363
Back in a flash.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.883
Come on, let's go!

04:54.040 --> 04:55.849
Okay!

04:56.000 --> 04:57.683
You see his face?

04:59.040 --> 05:00.882
Wait up for me.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.962
- Let's go, Joey.
- Okay, I'm coming.

05:23.599 --> 05:25.488
Want to get a cab?

06:34.839 --> 06:36.603
I like your scribbles.

06:37.839 --> 06:39.079
Yeah.

06:39.279 --> 06:40.883
I've been busy.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.281
I don't know how you do it.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.771
What?

06:44.920 --> 06:47.526
You look like a million bucks
first thing in the morning.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.365
I'll be down in a minute.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.281
So I got the schedules
in the mail.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.560
You listening to me?

06:58.760 --> 06:59.841
I'm listening.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.649
You got the schedules.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.120
There's two sailings
to France in June

07:04.279 --> 07:06.521
and one in July.

07:06.680 --> 07:07.805
Wow.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.644
So what do you think?

07:09.800 --> 07:12.962
I think...

07:13.120 --> 07:14.120
I think it's too cold.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.447
I can't think straight.

07:16.599 --> 07:18.409
All right,
let's get you warmed up.

07:18.560 --> 07:20.767
Compliments of the
season from the management.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.808
Compliments of the season
from the management.

07:22.959 --> 07:24.849
Season's greetings
from the management.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.161
Anyway,
she's just going crazy

07:26.320 --> 07:28.079
with no other girls
in the family but Esther.

07:28.159 --> 07:29.207
How is Esther?

07:29.360 --> 07:31.282
She'll pull through.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.760
Compliments of the season
from the management.

07:33.959 --> 07:36.281
Compliments of the season
from the management.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.885
Compliments of the season
from the management.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.200
I got to open the floor.

07:39.359 --> 07:40.690
See you later.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.247
Ms. Belivet,

08:05.399 --> 08:06.731
you're needed upstairs.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.724
Make it snappy.

08:14.079 --> 08:16.207
We got to
rearrange this whole display.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.327
Should we do it now or later?

08:18.479 --> 08:20.880
Got to do it now
before we open.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.602
Good morning, happy holidays

08:41.759 --> 08:42.885
and welcome, shoppers,

08:43.039 --> 08:44.849
to Frankenberg's.

08:44.999 --> 08:46.489
Be sure to take advantage

08:46.640 --> 08:48.483
of our Congratulations,
Ike and Mamie,

08:48.640 --> 08:50.688
Inaugural Early Bird Special

08:50.839 --> 08:52.364
in our beds
and bedding department

08:52.520 --> 08:54.443
on the second floor.

08:54.599 --> 08:55.964
And on your way there,

08:56.119 --> 08:58.646
you won't want to miss
our brand-new General Electric

08:58.839 --> 09:00.444
television stereophonic display

09:00.599 --> 09:01.964
on the first floor,

09:02.119 --> 09:04.771
just past the haberdashery.

09:10.959 --> 09:12.689
Oh, there are the trains.

09:12.839 --> 09:15.002
- They're over there.
- Oh, they are.

09:16.719 --> 09:19.007
Mommy, please, please, please?

09:27.560 --> 09:28.641
Would you like a ribbon?

09:28.800 --> 09:29.925
- Hmm?
- Would you?

09:55.959 --> 09:58.007
Miss? Miss?

09:58.160 --> 09:59.729
Where's the ladies' room,
honey?

09:59.879 --> 10:02.007
If you go back to the elevator
and make a right,

10:02.160 --> 10:03.286
you can't miss it.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.282
Thank you.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.804
I wonder
if you might help me

10:22.959 --> 10:24.484
find this doll

10:24.640 --> 10:26.563
for my daughter.

10:26.759 --> 10:28.046
Bright Betsy.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.531
Oh, she cries

10:29.719 --> 10:31.449
and wets herself,

10:31.640 --> 10:33.563
but I'm afraid
we're all out of stock.

10:33.719 --> 10:34.959
Oh.

10:35.119 --> 10:36.963
I've left it too long.

10:37.119 --> 10:38.609
Well, we have plenty
of other dolls,

10:38.759 --> 10:41.205
- um, all kinds, actually.
- Right.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.561
What was your favorite doll
when you were four?

10:43.719 --> 10:44.720
Me?

10:44.879 --> 10:47.531
I never...

10:47.680 --> 10:49.522
Not many, to be honest.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.767
I'm sorry, you're not allowed
to smoke on the sales floor.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.561
Of all the...

10:57.719 --> 10:59.767
Forgive me.
Shopping makes me nervous.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.839
That's all right.
Working here makes me nervous.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.883
You're very kind.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.484
Here she is.

11:06.640 --> 11:09.007
Oh, she looks like you,

11:09.160 --> 11:10.241
around the eyes.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.686
You think so?

11:12.839 --> 11:15.729
What did you want
when you were this age?

11:15.879 --> 11:17.961
A train set.

11:19.239 --> 11:21.003
Really?

11:21.160 --> 11:22.650
Do you know much
about train sets?

11:22.800 --> 11:23.847
I do, actually,

11:23.999 --> 11:25.763
and we just got
a new model in last week.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.205
It's hand-built
with hand-painted cars.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.446
It's a limited edition

11:28.599 --> 11:29.805
of 5,000.

11:29.959 --> 11:31.359
You might have seen it
on the way in

11:31.440 --> 11:32.850
over by the elevators.

11:32.999 --> 11:35.570
I would show you, but I'm sort
of confined to this desk.

11:37.239 --> 11:39.321
- Do you ship?
- Special delivery.

11:39.479 --> 11:41.527
You could have it
in two or three days.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.249
They'd even assemble it
for you.

11:43.400 --> 11:44.685
Well,

11:44.879 --> 11:46.166
that's that.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.243
Sold.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.527
Shall I pay now?

11:52.719 --> 11:53.881
Oh, yes, of course.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.405
Um...

12:02.280 --> 12:03.770
We'll need your account details

12:03.920 --> 12:05.603
and your shipping address.

12:05.759 --> 12:06.921
Of course.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.440
I love Christmas.

12:10.599 --> 12:13.364
Wrapping presents and all that.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.566
And then,

12:14.719 --> 12:17.371
somehow you wind up overcooking

12:17.520 --> 12:19.443
the turkey anyway.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.402
Done.

12:26.119 --> 12:28.248
Where'd you learn so much
about train sets?

12:28.400 --> 12:29.480
Oh, I read.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.801
Too much, probably.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.325
That's refreshing.

12:33.479 --> 12:36.131
Thank you.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.600
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

12:43.239 --> 12:45.766
I like the hat.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.445
There's a gift for everybody

12:47.599 --> 12:49.602
in our accessories department
on street level,

12:49.759 --> 12:52.843
where you'll find the entire
Parker pen line on sale,

12:52.999 --> 12:56.560
including Parker's new
smooth lining 51.

12:56.719 --> 12:59.121
With only one moving part,

12:59.280 --> 13:02.443
making writing
as easy as conversation.

13:02.599 --> 13:04.602
See what the sensation
of the season is

13:04.759 --> 13:05.761
in our toys department

13:05.959 --> 13:07.371
on the fourth floor.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.359
You won't be able to resist
the best-selling...

13:25.079 --> 13:27.526
You look absolutely divine!

13:27.680 --> 13:28.920
Turn around.

13:29.079 --> 13:30.411
- Please.
- Come on.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.209
Perfect, wonderful shoulders.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.526
Move over.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.965
Nobody else can see the screen.

13:35.119 --> 13:36.609
Nobody else is watching.

13:36.759 --> 13:38.762
I'm watching.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.400
I've seen it six times.

13:41.560 --> 13:44.642
Hmm?

13:44.800 --> 13:46.689
Right now, I'm charting
the correlation

13:46.839 --> 13:49.127
between what the characters say
and how they really feel.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.363
My kid brother, the movie jerk.

13:56.239 --> 13:58.083
I'm strictly a beer man.

13:58.239 --> 14:00.003
Everything else makes me
want to vomit.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.719
Well, wine makes me
feel naughty,

14:02.759 --> 14:04.090
but in a good way.

14:04.239 --> 14:06.607
I drink to forget I got to
get up for work in the morning.

14:06.759 --> 14:07.886
Oh, see,
that's your problem, Semco.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.086
You really ought to drink

14:09.239 --> 14:10.640
because you remember
you have a job.

14:10.719 --> 14:11.959
Employment's a curse.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.281
You have a job, Phil.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.487
You call that a job?

14:14.640 --> 14:15.641
I call that an illusion.

14:15.800 --> 14:16.847
You get paid.

14:16.999 --> 14:18.684
Is money an illusion?

14:18.839 --> 14:20.648
My kid brother,
the jerk philosopher.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.642
And where do you work?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.564
- Mmm.
- Didn't you know?

14:24.719 --> 14:27.121
Dannie works
at the New York Times.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.326
No kidding.

14:28.479 --> 14:30.243
It's a job.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.084
What I really want
to do is write.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.162
That's why I watch movies.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.765
Everybody's a writer.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.081
Uh, say, Therese,

14:38.239 --> 14:39.844
before I get too drunk
to remember...

14:39.999 --> 14:41.603
You did it?

14:41.759 --> 14:42.761
It's fixed?

14:42.920 --> 14:44.364
He said it was a cinch,
no sweat.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.607
Oh, thank you, Phil.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.648
I was missing it.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.325
So you take pictures?

14:49.520 --> 14:50.759
Well...

14:50.920 --> 14:52.410
She's more excited
about some chintzy camera

14:52.560 --> 14:54.483
than she is about sailing
with me to Europe.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.960
- Women!
- You said it, pal.

14:57.119 --> 14:58.724
- I don't believe it!
- Oh, look who's coming.

14:58.879 --> 15:00.882
Does the House
Un-American Activities know

15:01.040 --> 15:02.804
- you two are back on the streets?
- It's been ages.

15:02.959 --> 15:04.768
- Call me, would you?
- I will, I promise.

15:04.920 --> 15:05.967
You still owe me

15:06.160 --> 15:07.879
- for that poker game!
- Richard, watch out!

15:08.040 --> 15:09.768
- Yeah, sure, I do.
- Say,

15:09.959 --> 15:12.247
you should come by the Times

15:12.400 --> 15:13.640
for dinner sometime.

15:13.839 --> 15:15.807
I work nights, so...

15:15.959 --> 15:17.689
I got a pal
who's a junior photo editor.

15:17.879 --> 15:18.926
He loves to pontificate.

15:19.079 --> 15:20.763
- I'll introduce you.
- Really?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.047
Yeah, I'd like that.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.724
Yeah?

15:24.879 --> 15:26.119
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:04.759 --> 16:05.999
Thanks, Helman.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.286
I shouldn't be too long.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.727
Yes, sir.

16:09.879 --> 16:11.608
64,

16:11.759 --> 16:14.763
- 65,
- 65.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.205
66,

16:16.400 --> 16:18.401
67,

16:18.560 --> 16:20.004
- 68...
- Hello, Florence.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.366
- That must be your daddy.
- Hello, Mr. Aird.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.921
- Come on, better finish up.
- Is she upstairs?

16:24.079 --> 16:26.161
Yes, sir. She's in the bedroom.

16:28.119 --> 16:30.646
Mommy,
can you come skating, too?

16:30.800 --> 16:32.564
I wish I could, sweet pea.

16:32.719 --> 16:34.926
Why not? Pretty please?

16:35.079 --> 16:37.002
Hiya, sunshine.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.089
Daddy, I want Mommy to come.

16:40.239 --> 16:41.765
Oh, you do, do you?

16:41.920 --> 16:42.967
Hey.

16:43.119 --> 16:44.200
You're early.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.640
Mail came.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.847
Cy Harrison's wife...

16:50.999 --> 16:53.730
Jeanette.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.882
Jeanette asked about you.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.690
Did she?

16:57.839 --> 17:00.002
Are you gonna color
the trunk, honey?

17:00.160 --> 17:02.526
I know she'd love
to see you there.

17:07.959 --> 17:09.007
Well, give her my best.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.123
I've always liked Jeanette.

17:15.559 --> 17:17.482
I'd like you to be there.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.361
Sorry, Harge, I have plans.

17:22.519 --> 17:23.930
Mommy wants to give

17:24.079 --> 17:27.367
Aunt Abby some presents.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.401
You've been seeing
a lot of Aunt Abby lately,

17:32.600 --> 17:33.680
haven't you, sunshine?

17:33.840 --> 17:35.763
- Yes.
- With Mommy.

17:44.039 --> 17:45.882
I'll see if I can rearrange
with Abby.

17:46.039 --> 17:48.042
Thank you.

17:48.239 --> 17:50.287
Well, I told the customer

17:50.440 --> 17:52.567
it would arrive
by Christmas Eve.

17:52.719 --> 17:53.720
According to what
we've been told,

17:53.880 --> 17:54.960
three days should be
plenty of time.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.530
It should've been delivered
this afternoon.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.443
Oh.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.726
Right.

17:59.920 --> 18:01.444
So it arrived,
she signed for it?

18:01.600 --> 18:02.680
It arrived.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.040
Great. Thank you.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.280
Thanks.

18:07.440 --> 18:08.487
- Yes?
- We have a call for

18:08.680 --> 18:10.124
employee 645-A,
Therese Belivet.

18:10.279 --> 18:11.883
...blue eyes, and this one

18:12.039 --> 18:13.529
- has brown eyes...
- Belivet.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.170
Miss Belivet.

18:15.319 --> 18:17.162
Over here, please, now.

18:17.319 --> 18:18.651
I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me?

18:18.799 --> 18:20.802
- I'll just be one moment.
- Of course.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.801
Yes, um, I was trying
to decide between the two.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.167
All right.
Well, this one has...

18:29.319 --> 18:30.684
Hello?

18:30.840 --> 18:33.525
Is this employee
645-A, Therese Belivet?

18:33.680 --> 18:35.921
- Yes.
- We're patching you through.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.962
Hello?

18:38.120 --> 18:40.690
So it was you.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.325
Oh, hello, Mrs. Aird.

18:42.479 --> 18:44.402
Did you receive
the train set all right?

18:44.559 --> 18:46.244
I did. Yes.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.811
And the gloves.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.085
Thank you so much.

18:49.239 --> 18:50.571
You're a star for sending them.

18:52.640 --> 18:55.120
I just wanted
to say thank you, really.

18:55.279 --> 18:57.044
Of course.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.282
Well, what I wanted
to say was...

18:59.479 --> 19:01.448
do you get a lunch hour there?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.124
Well, let me take you to lunch.

19:03.319 --> 19:04.559
It's the least I can do.

19:04.719 --> 19:06.131
Well, yes, I...

19:06.319 --> 19:07.969
Of course, but you
really don't have to.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.962
- I'm free tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

19:10.160 --> 19:12.003
Do you know Scotty's on Madison?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.884
No, I don't know it.
Hold on.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.844
Could I borrow
a pencil and paper?

19:24.200 --> 19:26.123
Thank you.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.403
Um, all right.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.250
- There you are.
- Thank you.

19:50.799 --> 19:52.450
I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.168
I'll have the creamed spinach
over poached eggs.

19:56.319 --> 19:59.528
And a dry martini
with an olive.

20:02.319 --> 20:03.765
Um, I'll have the same.

20:03.959 --> 20:05.485
The meal or the drink?

20:05.640 --> 20:08.120
Um, all of it. Thank you.

20:12.039 --> 20:13.246
Cigarette?

20:13.400 --> 20:15.481
Yes, please.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.960
So, what kind of name
is Belivet?

20:30.120 --> 20:31.405
It's Czech.

20:31.559 --> 20:32.606
It's changed.
Originally, it was...

20:32.759 --> 20:34.363
It's very original.

20:34.519 --> 20:35.965
Well...

20:36.160 --> 20:38.083
- And your first name?
- Therese.

20:38.239 --> 20:39.321
Therese.

20:39.479 --> 20:42.324
- Not Theresa.
- No.

20:42.479 --> 20:45.689
Therese Belivet.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.086
It's lovely.

20:48.239 --> 20:50.606
And yours?

20:50.799 --> 20:52.847
Carol.

20:52.999 --> 20:55.809
- Carol.
- And two dry martinis.

20:55.959 --> 20:58.087
Thank you.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.082
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.443
So, I'm sure you thought
it was a man

21:12.600 --> 21:13.799
who sent you back your gloves.

21:13.880 --> 21:16.962
Hmm. I did.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.241
Thought it might've been a man
in the ski department.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.730
I'm sorry.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.404
No, I'm delighted.

21:22.559 --> 21:25.961
I doubt very much I would've
gone to lunch with him.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.008
Oh, your perfume...

21:28.160 --> 21:29.240
Yes?

21:29.400 --> 21:30.401
It's nice.

21:30.559 --> 21:31.606
Thank you.

21:31.799 --> 21:33.160
Harge bought me
a bottle years ago,

21:33.279 --> 21:34.440
before we were married,

21:34.600 --> 21:36.203
and I've been wearing it
ever since.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.009
Harge is your husband?

21:38.160 --> 21:39.650
Mm-hmm.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.450
Well, technically,
we... we're divorcing.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.084
I'm sorry.

21:44.239 --> 21:46.162
Don't be.

21:51.719 --> 21:54.962
And do you live alone,
Therese Belivet?

21:55.120 --> 21:56.848
I do.

21:56.999 --> 21:58.239
Well, there's Richard.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.163
He'd like to live with me.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.559
Oh, no, it's nothing like that.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.051
I mean, he'd like to marry me.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.690
I see.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.764
And would you like
to marry him?

22:08.959 --> 22:10.165
Well...

22:10.319 --> 22:13.244
I barely even know
what to order for lunch.

22:25.999 --> 22:27.808
And your meals.

22:29.559 --> 22:31.049
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.327
Enjoy.

22:33.479 --> 22:35.130
I'm starved.

22:35.319 --> 22:37.242
Bon appetit.

22:41.479 --> 22:43.527
What do you do on Sundays?

22:43.680 --> 22:44.760
Nothing in particular.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.331
What do you do?

22:46.479 --> 22:47.766
Oh...

22:47.959 --> 22:50.326
nothing lately.

22:50.479 --> 22:53.085
If you'd like to come
visit me sometime,

22:53.239 --> 22:54.684
you're welcome to.

22:54.880 --> 22:56.643
At least there's some
pretty country

22:56.840 --> 22:59.001
around where I live.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.844
Would you like to come
visit me this Sunday?

23:05.279 --> 23:07.123
Yes.

23:08.719 --> 23:10.847
What a strange girl you are.

23:10.999 --> 23:13.047
Why?

23:15.160 --> 23:17.287
Flung out of space.

23:32.719 --> 23:34.927
Do you ever put the top up?

23:51.319 --> 23:52.719
I can just see
Harge's mother's face

23:52.840 --> 23:54.600
when she sees me in this.

23:54.719 --> 23:56.484
Maybe I should
stop home and change.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.767
Oh, don't be a stupe.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.444
Maybe I should
just not show up.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.567
Well, then I'll be
blamed for it,

24:06.719 --> 24:09.086
so you better just grin
and bear it.

24:10.479 --> 24:12.720
You want to tell me about her?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.968
Therese?

24:15.120 --> 24:17.201
She returned my gloves.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.930
And?

24:19.080 --> 24:22.084
And if you don't get us out
of this traffic soon,

24:22.239 --> 24:25.323
I won't have to worry
about any damned party.

24:45.759 --> 24:49.286
Oh, where's... my compact?

24:49.440 --> 24:50.770
Goddamn it.

24:50.920 --> 24:53.321
You look fine.

24:53.479 --> 24:55.005
- Come in with me.
- Oh...

24:55.160 --> 24:57.322
- Just for a minute.
- Don't even start.

24:57.479 --> 24:59.607
You're the one who canceled
on us, you nitwit.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.403
I know. I know.

25:01.559 --> 25:03.049
I'm going. I'm going.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.043
I'm sorry.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.043
Call me later.

25:31.279 --> 25:33.965
You're always the most
beautiful woman in the room.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.241
Tell your mother that.

25:45.559 --> 25:46.924
Keep an eye out, will you?

25:47.080 --> 25:49.082
Cy will scream
if he catches me with this.

25:49.239 --> 25:51.129
What'll he do?

25:51.279 --> 25:53.248
Dock your allowance?

25:57.400 --> 25:59.163
He doesn't like me to smoke.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.645
So?

26:00.799 --> 26:02.961
- You like it.
- Mm-hmm.

26:07.319 --> 26:09.845
Carol, I...

26:09.999 --> 26:13.401
It really is not
my business, but...

26:13.559 --> 26:15.402
if you're gonna be alone
on Christmas,

26:15.559 --> 26:17.721
Cy and I would love
to have you.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.123
Thanks, Jeanette.

26:25.799 --> 26:28.530
I don't know.

26:28.719 --> 26:31.165
I might get away by myself.

26:33.559 --> 26:35.767
At least for a few days.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.080
Don't worry,
you're not gonna break anything

26:51.200 --> 26:53.362
if you pick it up.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.642
What are your pictures like?

27:04.200 --> 27:06.327
Oh, I don't know.
Not very good, probably.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.525
No, I-I mean, what are they?

27:09.719 --> 27:12.121
What do you take pictures of?

27:12.279 --> 27:13.963
Birds, trees, windows.

27:14.120 --> 27:16.282
Anything, really.

27:18.640 --> 27:20.688
What do you write about?

27:22.759 --> 27:24.682
People.

27:27.400 --> 27:31.200
I always feel funny
taking pictures of people,

27:31.360 --> 27:33.930
like it's some sort of...

27:34.120 --> 27:35.280
in...

27:35.440 --> 27:37.488
Invasion of privacy?

27:37.640 --> 27:39.607
Yeah.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.807
Well...

27:41.999 --> 27:46.324
all of us, you know,
we have affinities for people.

27:47.479 --> 27:48.641
We like certain people.

27:48.840 --> 27:50.080
You like certain people, right?

27:50.120 --> 27:51.200
Sometimes.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.440
And you don't like others.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.721
And you don't know why

27:54.880 --> 27:57.167
you are attracted
to some people and not others.

27:57.319 --> 27:59.129
The only thing
you really know is

27:59.279 --> 28:03.125
you either are attracted
or you're not.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.129
It's like physics...

28:07.319 --> 28:09.641
bouncing off each other
like pinballs.

28:11.319 --> 28:12.844
Yeah, but not everything's
as simple

28:12.999 --> 28:16.162
as a bunch of pinballs
reacting off of each other.

28:16.319 --> 28:19.289
Oh...

28:19.440 --> 28:23.125
Some things don't even react,
but everything is alive.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.565
It's getting late. I should go.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.201
You shouldn't.

28:51.759 --> 28:53.842
Why? Did you mind?

28:53.999 --> 28:56.047
No.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.168
I have to go.

29:02.999 --> 29:04.922
Come back tomorrow?

29:05.080 --> 29:06.319
- I don't know.
- Wednesday?

29:06.479 --> 29:09.210
Maybe. I-I don't know.

29:15.440 --> 29:18.682
- Here.
- Oh. Thanks.

29:18.840 --> 29:22.401
Thanks for staying sober
and driving me home.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.280
Good night, Harge.

29:26.479 --> 29:28.209
Carol.

29:30.319 --> 29:33.130
Come to my parents' house
for Christmas.

29:33.319 --> 29:34.809
We had a good time tonight.

29:34.959 --> 29:38.008
It was one night, Harge.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.282
I don't like the idea
of you being alone.

29:40.440 --> 29:42.123
I'm not alone.

29:42.279 --> 29:45.090
I have Rindy and Ab...

29:45.239 --> 29:46.809
Abby.

29:46.999 --> 29:50.606
There's always Abby.

29:50.799 --> 29:52.767
Abby and I were over

29:52.920 --> 29:55.844
long before you and I
were over, Harge.

29:58.239 --> 29:59.923
I'll have Rindy packed
and ready for you

30:00.080 --> 30:02.208
at 4:00 on Christmas Eve.

30:04.279 --> 30:06.487
It shouldn't be like this.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.843
I know.

30:17.999 --> 30:20.366
My special girl.

30:28.959 --> 30:31.247
Good night, Florence.

30:51.279 --> 30:53.123
Where's this place in Jersey?

30:53.319 --> 30:54.526
In the country, I think.

30:54.680 --> 30:57.000
I-I don't really know.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.088
My uncle Sal lives
in Union City.

30:59.279 --> 31:01.408
He claims it gets pretty
dangerous there at night.

31:01.559 --> 31:03.402
It's not Union City.

31:03.559 --> 31:04.766
Okay.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.763
Oh, there's my ride.

31:19.160 --> 31:20.446
- Hi.
- Hello.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.720
Carol Aird.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.803
Richard Semco.
Glad to meet you.

31:23.959 --> 31:25.165
Likewise.

31:25.319 --> 31:28.244
Therese speaks
very highly of you.

31:28.400 --> 31:30.720
Well, that's swell.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.086
So you'll get her back
safe and sound?

31:37.479 --> 31:39.448
Love you.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.284
I think I see snow.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.328
Wouldn't that be lovely?

32:12.239 --> 32:14.287
I love the snow.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.809
Makes it feel like Christmas,
don't you think?

33:13.279 --> 33:15.759
If it doesn't blow away.

33:30.279 --> 33:33.010
Need me to tie this
to the roof of your car?

33:50.719 --> 33:52.484
Car's just over there.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.603
Thank you, ma'am.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.322
Still with me?

34:23.480 --> 34:25.243
Yes.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.962
- Mommy!
- Rindy!

34:33.159 --> 34:35.206
Let's go get your mommy.

34:35.359 --> 34:37.966
- Mommy's home! Mommy!
- Oh!

34:38.120 --> 34:40.850
Hello, my darling.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.524
Guess what I brought you.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.444
No. I bet you'll never guess.

34:44.600 --> 34:45.806
Is it blue?

34:45.960 --> 34:48.360
No, it's green.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.964
Oh, it's long, isn't it?

34:50.120 --> 34:52.121
- Yeah.
- You need the scissors?

34:52.279 --> 34:53.565
Uh-uh.

34:53.719 --> 34:54.880
Maybe we should
do the star first.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.040
- We can do that.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:56.199 --> 34:57.281
Where's the star?

34:57.480 --> 34:59.004
The gold or the silver?

34:59.160 --> 35:01.527
- You choose.
- Okay.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.808
That's my girl.

35:07.879 --> 35:09.370
And what do you think?

35:09.520 --> 35:11.681
Good.

35:11.839 --> 35:14.410
We need...
This one's bright.

35:14.560 --> 35:16.881
And we can put it right here.

35:17.080 --> 35:20.288
That is the most beautiful

35:20.439 --> 35:23.283
Christmas tree
in the whole wide world.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.803
Were those pictures of me you
were taking at the tree lot?

35:37.960 --> 35:40.326
I'm sorry.
I should have asked.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.363
Oh, don't apologize.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.966
I've just been trying to...

35:45.120 --> 35:46.803
Well, I have a friend
who told me

35:46.960 --> 35:48.768
I should be more
interested in humans.

35:50.919 --> 35:53.127
And how's that going?

35:53.279 --> 35:56.123
It's going well, actually.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.203
I'm glad.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.607
That's beautiful.

36:41.319 --> 36:44.085
Is that what you want to be?

36:44.239 --> 36:46.004
A Photographer?

36:46.160 --> 36:47.524
I think so.

36:47.680 --> 36:50.000
If I have any talent for it.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.649
Isn't that something
other people

36:51.839 --> 36:53.763
let you know you have?

36:55.839 --> 36:59.207
And all you can do
is keep working.

36:59.359 --> 37:01.328
Use what feels right.

37:01.520 --> 37:03.602
Throw away the rest.

37:03.759 --> 37:05.761
I suppose so.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.281
Will you show me your work?

37:14.439 --> 37:15.884
Sure.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.529
I mean, I haven't sold anything

37:17.680 --> 37:20.410
or even shown a picture
to someone who could buy one.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.881
I don't even have
a decent camera.

37:25.359 --> 37:28.841
But they're all at my place,
under the sink, mostly.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.922
Invite me round.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.562
Harge, what's wrong?

37:47.040 --> 37:48.529
Nothing.

37:48.680 --> 37:51.330
Does there need to be a problem
for me to visit my wife?

37:59.719 --> 38:02.165
That's not fair, Harge.

38:02.319 --> 38:04.846
We agreed that Rindy would stay
with me until Christmas Eve.

38:05.040 --> 38:06.848
What do you suggest I do?

38:07.040 --> 38:08.529
Do you think I prefer
traipsing off

38:08.680 --> 38:10.283
to West Palm Beach
for the holiday?

38:10.439 --> 38:12.203
It was all Mother's idea.

38:12.359 --> 38:14.123
I'm not ready.
She's not packed.

38:14.279 --> 38:15.964
She's asleep upstairs in bed.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.484
What about my Christmas
with my daughter?

38:17.680 --> 38:19.120
I'm sorry, Carol,
it can't be helped.

38:19.160 --> 38:20.524
The flight's in the morning.

38:20.719 --> 38:22.881
And do you think
that I've packed already?

38:25.640 --> 38:27.642
Goddamn it!

38:43.399 --> 38:44.924
How do you know my wife?

38:45.120 --> 38:46.689
Harge, please.

38:46.839 --> 38:49.810
I work at Frankenberg's, sir,
the department store.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.571
I ordered a gift
from her desk.

38:52.719 --> 38:54.210
I forget my gloves,
she returned them,

38:54.359 --> 38:56.283
and I thanked her.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.602
Well, that's bold.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.002
Can I do anything?

39:11.160 --> 39:13.127
Just leave it be.

39:25.439 --> 39:26.565
Okay, snowflake.

39:26.719 --> 39:28.768
Give me a big one.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.439
You're gonna have
the most wonderful Christmas.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.442
I promise.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.569
There's room for you
in the car, Mommy.

39:36.759 --> 39:38.524
You can come with us.

39:38.719 --> 39:39.926
No, darling.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.730
I wish I could.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.848
You know, but sometimes,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.401
mommies and daddies

39:46.600 --> 39:48.727
just decide there isn't
enough room for them

39:48.879 --> 39:50.803
in the same place
at the same time.

39:52.560 --> 39:54.482
Anyway, Mommy has to stay here

39:54.640 --> 39:57.928
and make sure Santa's elf
doesn't give away your presents

39:58.080 --> 39:59.569
to another little girl.

39:59.719 --> 40:01.085
Wouldn't want that, would you?

40:01.279 --> 40:03.361
- No.
- No.

40:03.520 --> 40:05.442
I love you, snowflake.

40:19.120 --> 40:20.803
Mmm, you smell good.

40:22.160 --> 40:23.810
You're drunk.

40:25.319 --> 40:27.243
Harge, I'm cold.

40:28.839 --> 40:30.763
I-I'll make you some coffee.

40:32.040 --> 40:33.245
I'm not drunk.

40:33.439 --> 40:34.565
You can still come with us.

40:34.719 --> 40:36.609
Go pack a bag.

40:36.759 --> 40:38.569
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

40:38.719 --> 40:40.609
We'll get you a ticket
in the morning.

40:42.680 --> 40:44.044
What are you gonna do?

40:44.239 --> 40:45.401
What are you gonna do...

40:45.560 --> 40:47.210
you going to stay here
with Abby over Christmas?

40:47.359 --> 40:48.565
You gonna stay
with the shopgirl in there?

40:48.719 --> 40:49.767
- Harge!
- Huh?

40:49.919 --> 40:50.921
What are you gonna do,
Carol, huh?

40:51.160 --> 40:53.161
What is the plan?

40:53.319 --> 40:54.685
- Stop it!
- Damn it!

40:54.879 --> 40:56.928
I put nothing
past women like you, Carol.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.569
You married a woman like me.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.241
If you don't get in that car
with us right now...

41:06.399 --> 41:07.446
Then what?

41:07.640 --> 41:10.404
It's over?

41:12.879 --> 41:14.803
Goddamn you.

41:16.080 --> 41:18.401
You were never cruel.

41:21.040 --> 41:22.962
Harge...

41:25.640 --> 41:26.640
Thank you, Helman.

41:26.799 --> 41:27.801
Yes, sir.

41:27.960 --> 41:29.609
How's my girl?

41:29.759 --> 41:32.205
Ready to go see Grandma
and Grandpa?

41:47.879 --> 41:49.370
I should...

41:49.560 --> 41:50.924
call a cab.

41:54.719 --> 41:56.926
Just when you think
it can't get any worse,

41:57.080 --> 41:59.127
you run out of cigarettes.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.484
Oh, tell me where to go.

42:02.640 --> 42:04.721
I'll buy some for you.
I don't mind, really.

42:04.879 --> 42:07.120
You don't have to run
out in the middle of nowhere

42:07.200 --> 42:08.486
and buy cigarettes.

42:08.640 --> 42:10.165
I'm fine.

42:11.439 --> 42:13.203
There's a train at 8:30.

42:13.359 --> 42:15.727
I'll drive you to the station.

43:54.719 --> 43:56.768
Hello?

43:56.919 --> 43:59.241
Do you know what time it is,
Miss Belivet?

43:59.399 --> 44:01.323
I'm sorry, it just rang.

44:03.359 --> 44:05.806
Hello?

44:07.040 --> 44:08.848
I was horrible.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.808
Earlier.

44:10.960 --> 44:13.361
Will you forgive me?

44:14.640 --> 44:16.368
Yes, I mean...

44:16.520 --> 44:18.442
I mean...

44:19.719 --> 44:21.848
Then will you...

44:22.040 --> 44:25.567
Would you let me
come see you tomorrow evening?

44:28.759 --> 44:29.806
All right.

44:29.960 --> 44:31.882
Yes.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.410
I want to know...

44:37.600 --> 44:39.522
I think...

44:40.799 --> 44:43.040
I mean,
I want to ask you things,

44:43.200 --> 44:45.567
but I'm not sure
that you want that.

44:47.520 --> 44:50.444
Ask me things.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.522
Please.

45:30.919 --> 45:32.000
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.922
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Aird.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.241
There he is.

45:35.399 --> 45:36.685
Now will you talk to me?

45:36.839 --> 45:38.683
I just didn't want you
to come all the way down here.

45:38.839 --> 45:40.319
Oh, just give it
to me straight, Fred.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.960
What am I not to worry about
until after the holiday?

45:44.120 --> 45:47.761
Jerry Rix served
some papers this morning,

45:47.960 --> 45:50.247
to my complete surprise.

45:50.399 --> 45:52.482
Why don't you, uh, sit?

45:52.640 --> 45:54.687
Why is it people think
you'll take bad news better

45:54.839 --> 45:57.683
if you're sitting down?

45:57.839 --> 46:00.605
Harge has sought an injunction

46:00.759 --> 46:03.730
which denies you
any access to Rindy

46:03.879 --> 46:04.960
- until the hearing.
- What?

46:05.120 --> 46:07.247
And I'm afraid Harge
has changed his mind

46:07.439 --> 46:09.647
about joint custody.

46:09.799 --> 46:11.040
He wants sole custody of Rindy.

46:11.200 --> 46:14.363
We've already reached
an agreement on custody.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.567
What's this all about?

46:16.719 --> 46:18.687
They're filing papers
on the 29th

46:18.839 --> 46:20.000
in District Family Court

46:20.200 --> 46:22.931
for the, uh,
permanent custody petition.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.645
Can he do this?

46:24.799 --> 46:26.006
- Is it right?
- I don't know

46:26.160 --> 46:27.605
if it's right,
but it's legal.

46:27.759 --> 46:29.761
On what grounds?

46:29.960 --> 46:32.281
Listen, let's wait till
after Christmas...

46:32.439 --> 46:34.248
Fred, on what grounds?

46:34.399 --> 46:36.482
They're petitioning the judge

46:36.680 --> 46:39.160
to consider a morality clause.

46:39.319 --> 46:40.810
A morality...

46:40.960 --> 46:43.326
What the hell does that mean?

46:43.520 --> 46:44.964
Okay.

46:45.120 --> 46:47.201
I won't mince words with you.

46:47.359 --> 46:48.930
Abby Gerhard.

46:50.160 --> 46:51.763
Also, they're suggesting

46:51.919 --> 46:54.491
similar associations with...

46:54.640 --> 46:57.120
Well, they're alleging evidence
of a pattern of behavior.

46:57.319 --> 46:59.209
"Evidence of a pattern"?

46:59.359 --> 47:02.125
Abby is Rindy's godmother.

47:02.279 --> 47:04.203
Abb...

47:06.640 --> 47:10.042
If he can't have me,

47:10.200 --> 47:11.281
I can't have Rindy.

47:11.439 --> 47:13.089
That's what...

47:15.960 --> 47:18.007
I'm sorry,
but they seem serious.

47:18.160 --> 47:19.968
W-When is the custody hearing?

47:20.120 --> 47:22.247
It's hard to say with
the holidays and a backlog.

47:22.399 --> 47:24.243
Your best guess, Fred.

47:24.399 --> 47:26.482
Not before March.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.368
Maybe middle of April.

47:30.879 --> 47:32.404
Can I see her?

47:32.560 --> 47:34.085
Not... Let me put it this way.

47:34.239 --> 47:36.685
It wouldn't
be advisable under...

47:36.839 --> 47:38.879
- At school? In an office?
- The issue is not where,

47:38.919 --> 47:40.285
- necessarily.
- Surely,

47:40.439 --> 47:42.044
- a visit, supervised, but...
- Carol, these are

47:42.239 --> 47:43.286
serious allegations.

47:43.439 --> 47:45.044
Forcing contact
before the hearing.

47:45.200 --> 47:48.009
You risk inviting
further scrutiny

47:48.160 --> 47:50.082
- concerning your conduct.
- My conduct?

47:52.279 --> 47:54.281
Jesus Christ.

47:54.439 --> 47:56.966
I'm her mother, for God's sake.

48:01.960 --> 48:03.882
Morality clause.

48:05.160 --> 48:07.002
I see.

48:07.160 --> 48:08.285
Do you?

48:08.480 --> 48:10.368
No.

48:12.239 --> 48:14.640
There's nothing moral
about keeping Rindy from me.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.482
Taxi!

48:55.960 --> 48:57.643
Hey, watch it, lady.

49:33.319 --> 49:34.651
Yes, that's it.

49:34.799 --> 49:36.723
Thank you.

49:52.919 --> 49:54.080
Find what you wanted?

49:54.239 --> 49:56.207
Yeah, something
for someone at the store.

49:56.359 --> 49:59.011
Huh, that's nice of you.

49:59.160 --> 50:02.209
You should stop by
on Christmas sometime.

50:02.359 --> 50:04.169
My mom's sort of planning on it.

50:04.319 --> 50:05.685
Christmas?

50:05.839 --> 50:07.330
That's for families.

50:07.480 --> 50:09.402
I-I'd feel, I don't know...

50:09.600 --> 50:11.886
You are family, Terry.

50:14.719 --> 50:17.326
I've been thinking of
putting together a portfolio.

50:17.520 --> 50:20.250
Of my pictures, you know?

50:20.439 --> 50:22.203
Start taking portraits, even.

50:22.399 --> 50:24.129
Apply for jobs.

50:24.319 --> 50:25.890
Maybe even at a newspaper.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.245
Dannie said he knows someone.

50:27.399 --> 50:29.323
Have you been thinking
any more about Europe?

50:31.399 --> 50:33.323
Terry?

50:34.600 --> 50:36.522
What?

50:39.359 --> 50:40.930
How many times
have you been in love?

50:43.200 --> 50:45.440
Never.

50:45.600 --> 50:47.489
- Until you.
- Don't lie.

50:47.680 --> 50:49.250
You told me
about those other two girls.

50:49.399 --> 50:51.879
Come on, they were...

50:53.680 --> 50:55.250
I had sex with them.

50:55.399 --> 50:57.129
That's not the same thing.

50:57.279 --> 51:00.203
Meaning I'm different because
we haven't gone all the way?

51:00.399 --> 51:01.730
No.

51:04.160 --> 51:06.241
Hey, what's this all about?

51:06.399 --> 51:08.482
I love you.

51:08.640 --> 51:10.721
That's what's different.

51:18.399 --> 51:20.368
Have you ever been in love
with a boy?

51:22.879 --> 51:24.529
No.

51:24.680 --> 51:26.205
But you've heard of it.

51:26.359 --> 51:27.600
Of course.

51:27.799 --> 51:29.399
I mean, have I heard
of people like that?

51:29.439 --> 51:31.363
- Sure.
- I don't mean people like that.

51:31.520 --> 51:33.248
I just mean two people

51:33.399 --> 51:35.209
who fall in love
with each other.

51:35.359 --> 51:37.408
Say, a boy and a boy
out of the blue.

51:37.600 --> 51:40.728
I don't know anyone like that.

51:40.879 --> 51:42.928
But I'll tell you this,

51:43.080 --> 51:45.560
there's always some reason
for it in the background.

51:45.719 --> 51:49.201
So you don't think
it could just...

51:49.359 --> 51:51.089
happen to somebody,
to anybody?

51:51.279 --> 51:53.850
No, I don't.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.125
What are you saying?

51:55.279 --> 51:56.399
Are you in love with a girl?

51:56.480 --> 51:57.810
No.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.239
Don't you know I want to spend

51:59.399 --> 52:01.004
my life with you?

52:01.160 --> 52:02.207
Come to France with me.

52:02.359 --> 52:03.361
Let's get married.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.203
Richard,
I'm not ready for that.

52:05.359 --> 52:07.203
I can't just make myself...

52:07.359 --> 52:09.123
What?

52:09.279 --> 52:10.725
- Tell me.
- I'm sorry.

52:10.879 --> 52:12.006
I-I have to go.

52:12.160 --> 52:13.321
Terry!

52:13.480 --> 52:15.801
I'm sorry.

52:18.560 --> 52:19.924
I found Rindy's hairbrush

52:20.080 --> 52:23.129
underneath my pillow
this morning.

52:23.279 --> 52:25.886
Full of her hair.

52:26.040 --> 52:27.370
She does that, you know,

52:27.520 --> 52:29.248
to let me know
she's been a good girl

52:29.399 --> 52:31.368
and brushed properly.

52:33.200 --> 52:35.406
Usually, I clean it out,

52:35.560 --> 52:37.960
but today, for some reason...

52:38.160 --> 52:39.446
How could he?

52:39.600 --> 52:41.364
How dare he?

52:41.520 --> 52:43.363
A morality what?

52:43.520 --> 52:46.728
"Clause," he said.

52:46.919 --> 52:48.330
Oh, Carol.

52:48.480 --> 52:50.801
If I am responsible
in any way...

52:50.960 --> 52:52.962
Don't you dare.

52:53.120 --> 52:55.440
Don't you ever.

53:07.000 --> 53:09.446
Anyway, I got my eye
on this redhead

53:09.600 --> 53:11.886
who owns a steakhouse
outside of Paramus.

53:12.040 --> 53:13.564
I'm talking

53:13.719 --> 53:15.643
serious Rita Hayworth redhead.

53:15.799 --> 53:17.450
Really? You think you got
what it takes

53:17.600 --> 53:19.522
to handle a redhead?

53:23.759 --> 53:25.330
You going somewhere?

53:25.480 --> 53:27.288
West, I thought.

53:27.439 --> 53:29.408
At least for a few weeks

53:29.560 --> 53:30.924
until the hearing.

53:31.080 --> 53:32.888
What else am I gonna do?

53:33.040 --> 53:36.122
Well, I know you don't like
driving alone, so...

53:39.080 --> 53:41.002
She's young.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.763
Tell me you know
what you're doing.

53:48.239 --> 53:50.163
I don't.

53:54.120 --> 53:56.009
I never did.

54:12.560 --> 54:14.846
Your landlady let me in.

54:17.279 --> 54:19.520
Merry Christmas.

54:22.160 --> 54:24.082
Open it.

54:38.600 --> 54:41.171
Oh, Carol.

54:55.399 --> 54:56.765
It's not very good.

54:56.919 --> 54:58.250
I was rushed.

54:58.399 --> 55:00.767
I mean, I can do better.

55:02.640 --> 55:04.607
It's perfect.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.768
Was this you?

55:10.919 --> 55:12.843
Mm-hmm.

55:18.919 --> 55:20.569
Do you have anything

55:20.719 --> 55:22.768
other than photo chemicals
in the icebox?

55:22.919 --> 55:24.285
I-I'm feeling...

55:24.439 --> 55:26.363
Sure.

56:00.239 --> 56:02.368
Is there any point in,

56:02.520 --> 56:04.442
I don't know, fighting it?

56:07.080 --> 56:08.888
The injunction?

56:09.080 --> 56:10.922
No.

56:11.080 --> 56:12.605
I feel useless,

56:12.759 --> 56:15.730
like I can't help you
or offer anything.

56:15.919 --> 56:19.002
It has nothing to do with you.

56:24.239 --> 56:26.163
I'm going away for a while.

56:28.879 --> 56:29.881
When?

56:30.040 --> 56:31.451
Where?

56:31.600 --> 56:33.966
Wherever my car will take me.

56:34.120 --> 56:36.406
West.

56:38.319 --> 56:40.243
Soon.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.727
And I thought, perhaps,

56:44.879 --> 56:46.768
you might like to come with me.

56:53.120 --> 56:55.486
Would you?

56:56.759 --> 56:58.489
Yes.

56:58.640 --> 57:00.562
Yes, I would.

57:14.200 --> 57:15.850
You don't even know her!

57:16.000 --> 57:20.085
You can forward any of my mail
to Chicago, General Post.

57:20.279 --> 57:22.089
I've paid rent
through February.

57:22.279 --> 57:24.169
I had a little extra...

57:24.319 --> 57:26.049
money saved.

57:26.239 --> 57:27.924
For our trip.

57:28.120 --> 57:29.884
Our trip, Terry.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.366
And now you're...

57:32.839 --> 57:34.489
I don't believe
this is happening.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.330
I can't explain it.
I just...

57:38.480 --> 57:39.844
What?

57:40.000 --> 57:42.241
You got one hell of a crush
on this woman is what.

57:42.399 --> 57:43.446
You're like a schoolgirl.

57:43.600 --> 57:45.364
I do not.
I just like her is all.

57:45.520 --> 57:47.841
I'm fond of anyone
I can really talk to.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.922
Nice.

57:51.759 --> 57:53.569
You know what I think?

57:53.719 --> 57:54.926
I think, two weeks from now,

57:55.080 --> 57:57.241
you're going
to be wishing that...

57:58.640 --> 58:00.051
She's going to get tired of you

58:00.200 --> 58:01.611
and you're going
to that wish you had never...

58:01.759 --> 58:03.171
- You don't understand!
- Oh, I do.

58:03.399 --> 58:04.401
I understand completely!

58:04.560 --> 58:05.560
You're in a trance!

58:05.719 --> 58:06.767
I'm wide awake.

58:06.919 --> 58:08.000
I've never been
more awake in my life.

58:08.200 --> 58:09.803
Why don't you leave me alone?

58:11.239 --> 58:12.286
Are we over?

58:12.439 --> 58:13.520
Is that what this is?

58:14.600 --> 58:15.647
I didn't say that.

58:15.799 --> 58:17.040
But why should I want
to be with you

58:17.200 --> 58:19.440
when all you do
is argue about this?

58:19.600 --> 58:20.839
To say...

58:22.600 --> 58:24.408
To say for one minute

58:24.560 --> 58:26.767
that you practically
want to say good-bye

58:26.919 --> 58:28.489
because of some silly crush?!

58:28.680 --> 58:31.285
I didn't say that.
You said it.

58:31.439 --> 58:33.727
You made me buy boat tickets!

58:33.879 --> 58:36.850
I got a better job for you!

58:37.000 --> 58:40.765
I asked you to marry me,
for Christ sakes...

58:40.919 --> 58:43.843
I never made you;
I never asked you for anything.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.808
Maybe that's the problem.

58:45.960 --> 58:47.529
I swear to you, in two weeks,

58:47.680 --> 58:49.239
you are going to be
begging me to forget

58:49.359 --> 58:51.283
this whole thing ever happened.

58:51.439 --> 58:53.123
Richard...

58:53.279 --> 58:55.361
- Richard!
- You have a great trip, Terry!

59:31.359 --> 59:34.125
- Did you get the coffee?
- Yeah. Coffee.

59:51.319 --> 59:52.890
All right.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.921
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.600
I could get used to
having a whole city to myself.

01:00:55.759 --> 01:00:56.966
Mm.

01:01:10.319 --> 01:01:11.321
For you.

01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.480
Merry Christmas.

01:01:12.719 --> 01:01:14.960
Oh, no, you shouldn't have.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:16.167
Open it.

01:01:30.839 --> 01:01:33.080
I played it for you,
on piano, at your house.

01:01:33.279 --> 01:01:34.326
I remember.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.926
Got that, uh, poached on wheat?

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.527
Thank you.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.408
Oh, God, don't.

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.607
I look a fright.

01:01:42.759 --> 01:01:45.047
You do not, you look wonderful.

01:01:46.439 --> 01:01:48.123
Just... stay like that.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.364
Do you miss Richard?

01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:56.886
No. I haven't
thought about him all day.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.451
Or of home, really.

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:03.643
Home...

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.719
Yes, it's
a warm family get-together

01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:26.131
for the U.S. President-elect.

01:02:26.279 --> 01:02:28.203
His grandchildren and their toys

01:02:28.359 --> 01:02:30.681
are his primary concern
at the moment,

01:02:30.879 --> 01:02:32.689
for what would
this joyous season be like

01:02:32.879 --> 01:02:35.087
without little people
to give it meaning?

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.683
Let me speak to her.

01:03:05.839 --> 01:03:07.410
What are you doing here?

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.881
You're supposed
to be in Florida.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.484
Well, I couldn't do that,

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.167
because Rindy would like to be
with her mother for Christmas.

01:03:15.319 --> 01:03:17.049
Not that it's any
of your goddamn business.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.689
Now go get her.
I know she's here.

01:03:18.839 --> 01:03:21.605
Oh, you've got some fucking
nerve ordering me around.

01:03:21.759 --> 01:03:22.806
And, no...

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.040
she's not here.

01:03:25.839 --> 01:03:26.966
Well, that's impossible,

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.009
because she's not at home
and she's not with me,

01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.321
so she must be with you.

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:31.520
Yeah.

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.808
You know, Harge,
you have a point.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.247
You've spent ten years
making damn sure

01:03:37.399 --> 01:03:39.448
her only point of
reference is you...

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.761
your job, your friends,
your fam...

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:44.605
Where is she? Goddamn it!

01:03:44.759 --> 01:03:46.285
She's still my wife, Abby.

01:03:46.439 --> 01:03:47.520
She's my responsibility.

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:48.681
You know, that's some way
of showing it,

01:03:48.839 --> 01:03:51.002
slapping her
with an injunction.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.399
I'm closing the door.

01:03:57.399 --> 01:03:58.526
I love her.

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.761
I can't help you with that.

01:04:45.439 --> 01:04:47.919
- Carol?
- Therese, is that you?

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.560
- Yes.
- Would you be a sweetie

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.808
and fetch me
my, uh, blue sweater?

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:54.042
It's in the big suitcase,
on the bed.

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.770
Okay.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.529
Hey, slowpoke...

01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:22.767
Found it.

01:05:26.919 --> 01:05:27.921
Thanks.

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.080
Everything all right?

01:05:29.239 --> 01:05:31.480
Yeah, I'm just
suddenly starving.

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.243
All right.
Be out in a minute.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.882
You hungry?

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.484
Sure.

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.006
Thanks.

01:05:52.399 --> 01:05:54.163
Do you feel safe?

01:05:54.319 --> 01:05:56.004
With me, I mean?

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.730
You're full of surprises.

01:06:02.439 --> 01:06:05.569
I mean, you'd tell me if...
something scared you

01:06:05.759 --> 01:06:08.444
and there was something
I could do to help?

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.004
I'm not frightened, Therese.

01:06:19.439 --> 01:06:21.408
You're listening to WHPC,

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.085
1480, Canton, Ohio.

01:06:23.279 --> 01:06:24.560
"And That's The Chance
You Take,"

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.725
from Eddie Fisher.

01:06:25.879 --> 01:06:28.359
♪ Perhaps he'll be your true love ♪

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.763
♪ Perhaps you'll
seek a new love ♪

01:06:31.919 --> 01:06:33.888
♪ But that's
the chance you take... ♪

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.082
Our standard rooms

01:06:36.239 --> 01:06:38.082
come equipped with
stereophonic console radios.

01:06:38.239 --> 01:06:40.207
Or we do have the
Presidential Suite available

01:06:40.359 --> 01:06:43.091
for a very attractive rate.

01:06:43.239 --> 01:06:45.368
Two standard rooms
should be fine.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.522
Why not take
the Presidential Suite?

01:06:49.399 --> 01:06:51.243
I mean,
if the rate's attractive.

01:07:04.919 --> 01:07:06.444
Can I help you with that?

01:07:07.879 --> 01:07:09.290
Yes, thank you.

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:11.964
It's so cold.

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.765
It's so cold my glasses
fogged clear over.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.689
There you go.

01:07:18.839 --> 01:07:20.444
Thanks again.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.364
- Night.
- Good night.

01:07:24.839 --> 01:07:26.569
- Don't blink.
- Sorry.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.325
There.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.491
I need lipstick.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.765
Again.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.569
Take a look at yourself.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.765
Beautiful.

01:08:09.239 --> 01:08:10.890
Okay. Next?

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.962
Would mademoiselle be so kind

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.928
as to apply to
her pulse points only?

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.406
Me, too.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.211
Oh, that's divine.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:29.805
Smell that.

01:08:33.559 --> 01:08:34.640
Mm.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.291
To President McKinley.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.287
Can we get those
postcards in the lobby?

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:13.522
It would be really nice
to send one back home.

01:09:13.679 --> 01:09:14.680
Yeah.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:15.920
Good morning.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.361
Glad to see you didn't
freeze over or nothing, huh.

01:09:18.519 --> 01:09:21.000
You, too.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.845
Afraid the coffee's
not very good.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.769
Ah... as long as it's hot.

01:09:27.639 --> 01:09:28.687
What's in the case?

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.564
Oh... uh, notions.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.238
I'm, uh... I sell them.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:35.447
Or I try to.

01:09:35.679 --> 01:09:36.760
Oh.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.604
Lousy coffee.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.410
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.761
- Excuse me?
- We were just chatting.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.809
Name's Tucker. Tommy.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.563
Therese Belivet, Carol Aird.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:49.880
Pleased to meet you.

01:09:53.238 --> 01:09:55.207
Mr. Tucker sells notions.

01:09:57.479 --> 01:09:58.527
I see.

01:09:58.679 --> 01:10:00.648
I don't know what
notions are, exactly,

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.483
but they do instruct us
to use the word.

01:10:02.639 --> 01:10:03.687
Says it appeals to women.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.041
Do you have any lipsticks?

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.964
No.
But I do have a sewing kit.

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:11.484
You don't need a sewing kit.

01:10:11.639 --> 01:10:13.880
I can tell.

01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.770
I think we can make Chicago
by 5:00 or 6:00,

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.444
if we get an early start.

01:10:18.639 --> 01:10:19.765
That is where I'm headed.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.648
There's a shortcut
across the interstate.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.961
Knocks two hours off the drive.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.479
Two hours?
That would be something.

01:10:25.599 --> 01:10:26.680
Mm-hmm!

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.045
Can we stop and get some
magazines on the way?

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.201
Mm-hmm.

01:10:29.399 --> 01:10:31.720
I have "Field and Stream,"

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.644
"National Geographic..."

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.925
"Popular Photography"?

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.402
Nope. Course not.

01:10:39.559 --> 01:10:41.528
I am doomed
to remain without a sale.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.166
Oh, wow, much better.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.846
Is this all right?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.239
Thank you so much.

01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.805
Finally.

01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.882
A real bed.

01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:36.564
Heaven.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.326
This fabric.

01:12:39.479 --> 01:12:41.925
And this furniture.

01:12:58.599 --> 01:12:59.760
Good evening.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:01.569
Table for two, please,
for dinner.

01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.439
Are you staying
here at the hotel?

01:13:03.519 --> 01:13:08.127
Yes, it's, uh, room...
number...

01:13:08.279 --> 01:13:10.089
623. Mrs. Aird.

01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:12.527
That'll be just a moment,
Mrs. Aird.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.841
Therese Belivet.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.319
Hargess Aird. Hello?

01:13:51.319 --> 01:13:52.730
Somebody's popular.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.880
All from Richard.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.239
Are you going
to get your mail?

01:13:55.399 --> 01:13:56.764
Nobody knows I'm here.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:58.080
Were you making a phone call?

01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.121
What?

01:13:59.319 --> 01:14:01.209
No. Ladies' room.

01:14:33.399 --> 01:14:35.800
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

01:14:47.639 --> 01:14:49.688
Harge and I never spend
New Year's Eve together.

01:14:53.359 --> 01:14:55.044
Always a business function.

01:14:57.519 --> 01:14:59.203
Always clients to entertain.

01:15:01.319 --> 01:15:03.640
I always spend New Year's alone.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:05.251
In crowds.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.962
I'm not alone this year.

01:15:11.279 --> 01:15:12.840
And I'm looking up now,

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.529
as the snow
comes drifting down,

01:15:14.679 --> 01:15:17.001
and I see a pale winter moon

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:19.322
over Times Square...

01:15:19.519 --> 01:15:21.760
as the new year starts

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.968
its lumbering journey

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.849
into eternity...

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.321
Take me to bed.

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.488
I never looked like that.

01:16:22.239 --> 01:16:23.684
You're trembling.

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.007
No, don't.
I want to see you.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.960
My angel.

01:17:53.239 --> 01:17:55.162
Flung out of space.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.130
What town is this again?

01:18:32.279 --> 01:18:34.760
This?

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:37.321
Waterloo.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.444
Isn't that awful?

01:18:48.399 --> 01:18:49.401
The two men had left...

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:51.050
...Knoxville, Tennessee
last night and the driver said

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.440
Williams, who was in
his late 20s,

01:18:53.599 --> 01:18:54.725
had not been feeling well.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:56.483
- You the folks in 42?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18:56.639 --> 01:18:57.765
We're checking out.

01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.444
Telegram come for you
last night.

01:18:59.599 --> 01:19:01.886
The exact cause
of Williams' death

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.444
will be determined after...

01:19:03.599 --> 01:19:05.090
When did this arrive?

01:19:05.239 --> 01:19:07.480
Early. 7:00, 9:00.

01:19:07.639 --> 01:19:09.165
I ain't a clock, lady.

01:19:09.319 --> 01:19:10.446
The elderly
composer's home

01:19:10.599 --> 01:19:13.080
was in Montgomery, Alabama.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.689
Where is my suitcase?

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:26.046
- I put it in the back.
- I want my fucking suitcase!

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.564
Carol, what's going on?

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.643
Carol!

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:32.644
Carol!

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.086
Carol, what are you doing
with that?

01:19:36.399 --> 01:19:38.687
What happened?

01:19:39.960 --> 01:19:42.406
Carol, you're scaring me.

01:20:02.279 --> 01:20:05.010
Where's the tape,
you son of a bitch?

01:20:08.639 --> 01:20:10.961
How much is Harge
paying you for this, huh?

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:12.644
I'll give you double, triple,
whatever you want.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.325
I wish I could oblige you,
ma'am,

01:20:14.479 --> 01:20:16.084
but the tapes have already
been sent to your husband.

01:20:16.279 --> 01:20:17.644
That-that can't be right.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.326
My reputation rests
on my efficiency,

01:20:20.479 --> 01:20:22.209
Mrs. Aird.

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:25.568
How do I know you're not lying?

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.326
You don't, ma'am.

01:20:37.319 --> 01:20:39.560
Carol...

01:20:48.639 --> 01:20:50.608
How could you?

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.760
I'm a professional,
Miss Belivet.

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.001
It's nothing personal.

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.765
Let's get out of here.

01:21:04.479 --> 01:21:05.560
No, we left.

01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.323
There's nothing you can do.

01:21:07.479 --> 01:21:09.130
As soon as we got
your telegram.

01:21:09.279 --> 01:21:10.884
What did
the travel agent tell you?

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.729
That the earliest flight
into LaGuardia

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.410
is tomorrow afternoon.

01:21:14.559 --> 01:21:15.845
Tell me what you need.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.046
Oh, Abby.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.202
I don't know how to fix this.

01:21:19.359 --> 01:21:21.044
I haven't the strength.

01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:34.243
What are you thinking?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.367
Do you know how many times
a day I ask you that?

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:40.328
I'm sorry.

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:42.084
What am I thinking?

01:21:42.279 --> 01:21:45.170
I'm thinking that
I'm utterly selfish and I...

01:21:45.319 --> 01:21:46.526
Don't do this.

01:21:46.679 --> 01:21:48.488
You had no idea.
How could you have known?

01:21:48.639 --> 01:21:52.121
And I should've said no to you,
but I never say no.

01:21:52.279 --> 01:21:56.045
And it's selfish, because...

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.564
because I just take everything,

01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:59.370
and I don't know anything,

01:21:59.519 --> 01:22:01.328
and I don't know what I want,
and how could I

01:22:01.479 --> 01:22:03.482
when all I ever do
is say yes to everything?

01:22:20.279 --> 01:22:23.488
I took what you gave willingly.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.563
It's not your fault,

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.643
Therese.

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.723
All right?

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.371
Thank you, darling.

01:22:56.559 --> 01:22:57.560
So, how are you now?

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:59.290
Oh, you know.

01:22:59.479 --> 01:23:01.243
Shattered, sickened.

01:23:01.439 --> 01:23:03.399
Don't worry. We'll figure
this out, I promise you.

01:23:03.439 --> 01:23:05.248
I hope so.

01:23:05.399 --> 01:23:06.639
Anything else you need?

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.608
No, no, talk tomorrow.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.120
- Try and get some sleep.
- I will.

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.689
- And don't worry.
- Thank you.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:13.763
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:23.121
You don't have to sleep
over there.

01:24:52.439 --> 01:24:54.680
She's gone?

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:57.286
Early this morning.

01:24:57.439 --> 01:24:59.680
Is she coming back?

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:03.882
No.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.087
This is all my fault.

01:25:07.279 --> 01:25:10.045
That's nonsense.

01:25:15.479 --> 01:25:16.560
We should get going.

01:25:24.359 --> 01:25:26.282
Eat something.

01:25:28.559 --> 01:25:30.483
Suit yourself.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.921
Why do you hate me?

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.969
I haven't done anything to you.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.010
You really think I've flown
halfway across the country

01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.162
to drive you back east
because I hate you

01:25:46.359 --> 01:25:48.248
and want to see you suffer?

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:51.404
It's for Carol, not for me.

01:25:51.559 --> 01:25:53.800
That isn't...

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.769
With you and Carol,

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.563
what happened?

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.643
It's completely different.

01:26:10.239 --> 01:26:12.527
I've known Carol
since I was ten years old.

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.729
It was five or so years ago.

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.644
Summer.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:27.451
Late one night, my Ford...

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:30.126
broke down near
my mother's house.

01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:35.849
We tried to stay up...

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.524
but curled up together

01:26:37.679 --> 01:26:39.808
in my old twin bed.

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.882
And that was it.

01:26:43.679 --> 01:26:45.603
For a while.

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.327
And then it changed.

01:26:51.479 --> 01:26:53.403
It changes.

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:56.608
Nobody's fault.

01:27:06.519 --> 01:27:08.487
So...

01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:09.970
What?

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:14.364
Here.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.645
Dearest,

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.002
there are no accidents,

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:37.607
and he would've found us
one way or another.

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.322
Everything comes full circle.

01:27:42.479 --> 01:27:45.086
Be grateful it was sooner

01:27:45.239 --> 01:27:48.163
rather than later.

01:27:48.319 --> 01:27:50.925
You'll think it harsh of me
to say so,

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.925
but no explanation I offer
will satisfy you.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.411
Please don't be angry

01:28:00.559 --> 01:28:02.608
when I tell you
that you seek resolutions

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:06.605
and explanations
because you're young.

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:10.162
But you will
understand this one day.

01:28:36.479 --> 01:28:38.687
And when it happens,

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.163
I want you to imagine me there
to greet you,

01:28:43.319 --> 01:28:45.447
our lives stretched out
ahead of us,

01:28:45.599 --> 01:28:48.126
a perpetual sunrise.

01:29:00.679 --> 01:29:02.488
But until then,

01:29:02.679 --> 01:29:05.160
there must be no contact
between us.

01:29:05.319 --> 01:29:08.005
I have much to do,

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.288
and you, my darling, even more.

01:29:13.319 --> 01:29:16.323
Please believe that I would do
anything to see you happy.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:31.440
And so,
I do the only thing I can.

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.407
I release you.

01:31:11.439 --> 01:31:13.647
Hello?

01:31:16.439 --> 01:31:18.328
Carol?

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:37.848
I miss you.

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.721
I miss you.

01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:10.001
Therese?

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.246
You know,

01:32:11.399 --> 01:32:13.640
these are seriously good.

01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.688
You really captured

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.886
whoever this is.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.480
Oh, they're just practice.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.765
You really ought
to put together a portfolio.

01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.966
Say the word,
I'll introduce you

01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.042
to my pal at the Times.

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.327
There's always
a clerk job going.

01:32:48.319 --> 01:32:49.519
You went away with her, right?

01:32:49.639 --> 01:32:51.926
Yeah.

01:32:53.679 --> 01:32:56.081
What happened?

01:32:56.239 --> 01:32:58.162
Oh, nothing.

01:32:59.439 --> 01:33:02.523
It's hard to really...

01:33:02.679 --> 01:33:05.001
Is this because I tried
to kiss you that day?

01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.242
Because if it is,

01:33:07.399 --> 01:33:08.519
don't even think about that.

01:33:08.639 --> 01:33:10.005
You don't have
to be afraid of...

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:12.082
I'm not afraid.

01:33:19.239 --> 01:33:21.322
Let's finish while
we still have light, okay?

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.805
Still think you should
put together that portfolio.

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:32.439
Okay.

01:33:32.599 --> 01:33:35.045
The world and we have passed
the midway point

01:33:35.239 --> 01:33:38.084
of a century
of continuing challenge.

01:33:38.239 --> 01:33:40.367
More mashed potatoes, Carol?

01:33:40.519 --> 01:33:42.408
Oh, yes, thank you.

01:33:42.559 --> 01:33:44.688
They were delicious.

01:33:47.479 --> 01:33:49.322
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

01:33:49.479 --> 01:33:51.720
Thank you, Cate.

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:54.929
This fact defines
the meaning of this day.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:56.684
We are summoned,

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.921
by this honored
and historic ceremony...

01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:01.810
I had thought, perhaps,

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.928
that-that Marge and Chester

01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:05.922
would be back by now
with Rindy.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.729
Marge said to go ahead,

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.803
not to wait.

01:34:11.639 --> 01:34:12.640
I'm sure that

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.723
they'll be here soon.

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:20.279
Harge tells us you've been
getting along quite well

01:34:20.439 --> 01:34:22.568
with your doctor, Carol.

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:24.160
And why shouldn't
she get along well?

01:34:24.239 --> 01:34:26.162
He's a very expensive doctor.

01:34:26.319 --> 01:34:29.483
Well, actually,
he's not a doctor.

01:34:29.639 --> 01:34:31.563
He's a psychotherapist.

01:34:33.319 --> 01:34:35.925
Well, he's very well regarded.

01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:38.605
A Yale man, like your uncle.

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.603
Yes, but that doesn't
make him a doctor.

01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:44.730
...and their vast
empires have disappeared.

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:48.725
New nations have been born.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.688
For our own country,
it has been a time...

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.523
But I do like him very much.

01:34:52.679 --> 01:34:55.001
He's been a great help.

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:03.440
- My baby!
- Mommy!

01:35:03.599 --> 01:35:05.681
Oh!

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.921
Look how much you've grown.

01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:10.367
Oh!

01:35:10.519 --> 01:35:12.443
Can you give me a big squeeze?

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.046
Oh, that's a long trip.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:20.044
You must be hungry, sweetheart.

01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:22.009
Want to come have
something to eat?

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:23.446
Yes.

01:35:23.639 --> 01:35:25.563
Mm-hmm.

01:36:31.359 --> 01:36:33.282
Stay, stay.

01:36:33.439 --> 01:36:35.362
Oh, don't be daft.

01:36:45.319 --> 01:36:48.130
I don't think
I can keep this up, Abby.

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.165
I mean, how many
more tomato aspic lunches...

01:36:59.239 --> 01:37:00.479
You know...

01:37:00.639 --> 01:37:03.371
then I come home, every night,

01:37:03.519 --> 01:37:05.362
without her.

01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:07.203
To what? To this.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:10.729
And Therese?

01:37:17.399 --> 01:37:19.242
Wh-What about her?

01:37:19.399 --> 01:37:22.005
Have you heard anything?

01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:25.841
No.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.764
No, no.

01:37:29.319 --> 01:37:32.483
Been over a month
since she tried to call.

01:37:32.639 --> 01:37:34.961
There's nothing.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.848
I wish...

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.604
Have you

01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:46.524
- hear-heard something?
- From Therese? No.

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:52.242
She must have started her job
at the Times, though.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.282
I should have said, "Therese...

01:38:04.319 --> 01:38:06.970
...wait."

01:38:11.359 --> 01:38:14.523
Who the hell's
turning around in my drive?

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.648
I should go.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:19.848
No. No, you don't...

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.843
I do.

01:39:22.599 --> 01:39:25.080
We expect,
given the seriousness

01:39:25.239 --> 01:39:26.684
of the charges,

01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.968
and the incontestability
of the evidence,

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:32.044
that the court will grant
sole custody of the child

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.965
- to my client.
- Not so fast, Jerry.

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:38.123
My client's psychotherapist
is perfectly satisfied

01:39:38.279 --> 01:39:41.170
with her recovery
from the events of the winter,

01:39:41.359 --> 01:39:43.169
asserting she is
more than capable of caring

01:39:43.359 --> 01:39:44.486
for her own child.

01:39:44.639 --> 01:39:46.130
She's had no further contact

01:39:46.319 --> 01:39:48.640
with the...
the girl in question,

01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:50.688
and we have
sworn depositions from two

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.921
Saddlebrook Institute
psychiatrists

01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:54.849
clearly stating
that in their opinions,

01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:57.849
a series of events precipitated
by my client's husband

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.770
drove her to suffer an
emotional break which resulted

01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:03.000
- in the presumed aberrant behav...
- That's absurd!

01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:04.684
- Furthermore, given the way
these tapes - All right, Fred,

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.529
- were obtained - if this is
how you're gonna handle this...

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:08.370
and recorded, we're confident
of their inadmissibility.

01:40:08.519 --> 01:40:10.248
- Fred, please don't.
- All right, first off, Fred,

01:40:10.399 --> 01:40:12.399
I want to see these
depositions, and secondly, I...

01:40:12.479 --> 01:40:14.163
May-may I speak?

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.000
I won't deny the truth
of what's

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.281
Contained in those tapes...

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:19.679
This is off the record, honey.

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:23.690
May as well be on the record.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:25.489
Harge...

01:40:25.639 --> 01:40:26.970
I want you...

01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:29.042
to be happy.

01:40:29.239 --> 01:40:30.809
I didn't give you that.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.769
I... I failed you.

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:36.720
I mean, we both
could have given more, but...

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.406
we gave each other Rindy,

01:40:39.559 --> 01:40:43.359
and that is
the most breathtaking,

01:40:43.519 --> 01:40:45.727
the most generous of gifts.

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.402
So why are we spending
so much time

01:40:49.559 --> 01:40:52.086
trying to keep her
from each other?

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:56.007
Now, what happened
with Therese...

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.524
I wanted.

01:40:57.679 --> 01:41:00.763
And I will not deny it,

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.206
or say that I...

01:41:03.399 --> 01:41:04.970
But I do regret,

01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:08.090
and I grieve for the mess
we are about to make

01:41:08.279 --> 01:41:10.282
of our child's life.

01:41:10.439 --> 01:41:13.488
We, Harge,
are both responsible.

01:41:15.639 --> 01:41:18.882
So I think I...
we-we should set it right.

01:41:23.319 --> 01:41:25.129
Now, I think that Harge

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:26.929
should have custody

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:29.120
- of Rindy...
- Could I suggest we just take a break

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.524
- for a moment?
- No!

01:41:30.720 --> 01:41:32.050
Fred, will you let me speak?

01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:33.689
Because if you don't,

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:36.081
I will not be able to c-cope.

01:41:37.439 --> 01:41:38.600
Now, I'm no martyr.

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.808
I have no clue
what is best for me.

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.281
But I do know,
and I feel it in my bones,

01:41:43.479 --> 01:41:44.890
what is best for my daughter.

01:41:47.639 --> 01:41:49.368
Now, I want visits
with her, Harge.

01:41:49.519 --> 01:41:51.010
I don't care
if they're supervised.

01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.207
I just want them to be regular.

01:41:55.559 --> 01:41:57.642
Now, there was a time...

01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.608
when I would have done
almost anything,

01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.966
I would have
locked myself away...

01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:04.599
to keep Rindy with me.

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:08.410
But what use am I to her...

01:42:08.559 --> 01:42:11.928
to us, if I'm living
against my own grain?

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.889
So that's the deal.

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:17.690
I won't... I cannot
negotiate anymore.

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:19.683
You take it or leave it.

01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.082
But if you leave it,
we go to court.

01:42:23.239 --> 01:42:27.005
And if we go to court,
it'll get ugly.

01:42:29.239 --> 01:42:32.721
And we're not
ugly people, Harge.

01:42:35.279 --> 01:42:37.805
Hey, Carol...

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.166
Excuse me. Carol?

01:43:00.439 --> 01:43:03.010
Right there, right there.
Right here.

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.322
Guys, guys, pay attention.

01:43:05.519 --> 01:43:07.045
Here, you got the Rooster,
you got...

01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:09.805
you got DiMaggio...
front cover. Front cover.

01:43:19.399 --> 01:43:22.085
- This guy, this guy, this guy.
- That's the guy. -I like that.

01:43:22.239 --> 01:43:24.480
Where's that one we... where's
that photo we had earlier?

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.331
- I don't know.
- I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

01:43:29.479 --> 01:43:31.687
- No, no, no, no.
- I like this one better.

01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.446
Belivet.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.608
The lady is fantastic.

01:43:44.319 --> 01:43:46.800
Hand-delivered. Swank.

01:44:22.319 --> 01:44:23.605
Of course.

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:25.683
Thank you. Good-bye.

01:44:54.639 --> 01:44:57.086
I wasn't sure you'd come.

01:44:57.239 --> 01:44:59.560
It's nice of you to see me.

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.683
Don't say that.

01:45:04.479 --> 01:45:06.447
Do you hate me, Therese?

01:45:06.639 --> 01:45:08.688
No. How could I hate you?

01:45:16.679 --> 01:45:19.684
Abby tells me you're thriving.

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:23.287
You have no idea
how pleased I am for you.

01:45:23.439 --> 01:45:27.684
And you look very fine,
you know?

01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.286
As if you've suddenly blossomed.

01:45:31.720 --> 01:45:34.006
Is that what comes
of getting away from me?

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.571
No.

01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:48.121
What?

01:45:48.279 --> 01:45:49.644
Nothing.

01:45:54.679 --> 01:45:58.401
Harge and I are selling
the house.

01:45:58.559 --> 01:46:02.121
- I've taken an apartment on Madison Avenue.
- No, thank you.

01:46:02.319 --> 01:46:04.687
And a job, believe it or not.

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:06.921
I'm gonna work
at a furniture house

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.440
on 4th Avenue as a... buyer.

01:46:14.519 --> 01:46:16.840
Have you seen Rindy?

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.001
Once or twice.

01:46:20.359 --> 01:46:22.202
She's living with Harge,
for now.

01:46:22.359 --> 01:46:24.089
It's...

01:46:24.239 --> 01:46:26.207
the right thing.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.565
Anyway...

01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:36.403
the...

01:46:36.559 --> 01:46:39.005
apartment's a nice big one.

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:41.207
It's big enough for two.

01:46:41.399 --> 01:46:44.643
I was hoping you might like
to come live with me,

01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:47.326
but I guess you won't.

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.162
Would you?

01:46:56.639 --> 01:46:58.846
No, I don't think so.

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.803
I'm meeting some people

01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.246
at the, uh...

01:47:03.399 --> 01:47:05.845
Oak Room at 9:00,

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.206
if you want to have dinner.

01:47:08.359 --> 01:47:11.886
If you change your mind,
I-I think you'd like them.

01:47:20.519 --> 01:47:21.965
Well...

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:26.002
...that's that.

01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:42.804
I love you.

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.327
Therese? Is that you?

01:47:47.679 --> 01:47:49.125
What do you know?

01:47:49.279 --> 01:47:51.600
I-I'm saying to myself,
I know that girl.

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:53.683
- Jack.
- Gee, it's great to see you, Therese.

01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:56.241
- It's been... months.
- Months.

01:47:56.399 --> 01:47:58.562
- Jack, this is Carol Aird.
- Ah.

01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:01.121
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

01:48:01.279 --> 01:48:03.407
Well, hey, uh,
Ted Gray's meeting me here,

01:48:03.559 --> 01:48:06.086
and a bunch of us are heading
down to Phil's party.

01:48:06.279 --> 01:48:07.849
You're going, aren't you?

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.401
- Yes, I just planned to get there...
- You two go ahead.

01:48:10.559 --> 01:48:12.448
You coming along?

01:48:12.599 --> 01:48:14.045
No. No.

01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.408
I have to make a few calls
before dinner anyway.

01:48:17.559 --> 01:48:20.005
I really should run.

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:21.729
Are you sure?

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:24.001
Of course.

01:48:26.599 --> 01:48:28.761
Well, it would be great
to catch a ride.

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:30.684
Yeah, sure.

01:48:33.559 --> 01:48:35.562
You two have a wonderful night.

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:38.609
- Nice meeting you, Jack.
- Nice meeting you.

01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.849
All right, well, uh...

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.809
let me go make sure
the loaf's on his way.

01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.724
Back in a flash.

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.729
He just snuck me in.
I saw a doubleheader.

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:18.245
- It was just fantastic.
- Is that right?

01:49:18.399 --> 01:49:20.129
Yeah, great.

01:49:21.559 --> 01:49:23.050
You know, his brother, uh...

01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:27.440
...yeah, he snuck in.
Anyway, he had the right idea.

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.001
Yes, right up here,
right up here at the corner.

01:49:41.319 --> 01:49:43.890
- It's about time, Belivet!
- Hey, keep the change.

01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:46.440
Say hello, at least.
It hasn't been that long.

01:49:46.599 --> 01:49:48.966
- Hello, Phil. Sorry.
- Oh, there she is!

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:50.564
Get up there!

01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:52.170
What?

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:56.803
Nothing. There better be beer
up there, or wine.

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:43.406
I don't know, man.
You can have her.

01:50:43.599 --> 01:50:45.761
She's one of these real
Greenwich Village phonies,

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:47.604
if you ask me.

01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:49.523
I'm gonna
remember that, Charles.

01:50:49.679 --> 01:50:51.523
Where are you going, Ted?

01:50:51.679 --> 01:50:53.648
Stick around a minute.

01:50:55.479 --> 01:50:58.005
You're Phil's friend,
aren't you?

01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.440
I am, yes. And Dannie's.

01:51:00.599 --> 01:51:03.489
Aren't you gonna ask me
how I knew that?

01:51:03.639 --> 01:51:06.404
Aren't most people here
Phil's friends?

01:51:06.559 --> 01:51:09.643
I can see why Phil speaks
so highly of you.

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.410
Can you?

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:24.487
Sorry, I'll be out in a minute.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.081
Davidson's getting her ready

01:51:41.239 --> 01:51:43.640
to go back to San Francisco.

01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:45.768
What's he been doing to her?

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:48.406
- Praying.
- Praying?

01:51:48.559 --> 01:51:50.608
Praying.

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:00.608
Maybe, yes.

01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:03.809
I think that'd be a great idea.

01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:05.882
As bad as Boston?

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:17.924
Well, next year
you're gonna have to come out.

01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:19.844
Come out for-for the summer.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.479
Of course, no one dares
to tell them otherwise.

01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:26.885
He does that all the time.
He's a blowhard.

01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.287
Right?
There's no more direct...

01:52:29.439 --> 01:52:31.203
About how much time
would you say?

01:52:31.359 --> 01:52:32.929
Do you have a reservation?

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.524
- Sorry, I'm looking for someone.
- W-W...

01:52:34.679 --> 01:52:36.681
Ma'am, I can't seat you...
without a party.

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:38.120
- Good night, Sammy!
- Mr. Ellsworth.

01:52:38.279 --> 01:52:40.202
Good night, Dennis.
Thanks again.

01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:47.121
Uh, question.

01:52:47.279 --> 01:52:48.644
Yeah?
