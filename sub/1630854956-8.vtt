WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:04.320
I can't guarantee,
that we will make it back alive.

00:06.360 --> 00:08.600
The yrr could have been living
at these ocean depths

00:08.760 --> 00:10.680
for hundreds of millions of years.

00:11.160 --> 00:13.800
Before we meet this thing,
we better be ready for it.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.280
If we get anything back,
we'll know that they heard us.

00:21.560 --> 00:24.160
We've picked up something on the sonar.
A mass of some kind.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.720
-Luther, do you copy?
-Captain, we've lost contact.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.960
Whatever it was,
I think it followed us back inside.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.080
The substance tried to fuse
with some of her cells.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.680
The yrr or the substance it produces

00:40.920 --> 00:43.920
to take over the nervous system
of the species it enters.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.640
The yrr is inside of her.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.560
-Thank you for your hard work.
-We've been expecting you.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.280
-Hello, Sara.
-Mr. Mifune, sir.

01:54.440 --> 01:57.600
Dr. Johanson's team are assembled below.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.320
Let's go see them.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.120
What you are looking at, Mr. Mifune,
is a single-cell organism

02:09.360 --> 02:12.520
that can coalesce
into a larger multicellular mass.

02:14.360 --> 02:18.760
A single-cell organism
that can act on its own,

02:19.000 --> 02:22.480
but also a larger
multi-cellular collective mass

02:23.120 --> 02:26.040
able to shift in shape and density.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.320
Mr. Mifune, this is unlike
anything we have seen on Earth.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.960
And this organism...

02:37.520 --> 02:39.400
Is the Yrr.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.440
Whether one or a million cells.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.000
And it's what infected Ms. Delaware?

02:48.160 --> 02:52.480
Yes, and tried to fuse with her cells
when she came into contact with it.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.440
Sam, if you would show Mr. Mifune
what we've received?

02:58.680 --> 02:59.680
Yeah.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.400
I created an image

03:04.560 --> 03:08.960
showing our evolution
from the sea to the land,

03:09.120 --> 03:11.920
which we broadcast
from the ship, to which...

03:14.960 --> 03:16.680
we got a response.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.600
And what is that supposed to be?

03:19.840 --> 03:23.720
It's an image of the super-oceans
that surrounded the super-continent,

03:23.960 --> 03:27.640
250 million years ago,
when the Earth's continents were joined.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.720
-Panthalassa?
-Yes.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.080
Panthalassa, from the bottom
of the Antarctic Ocean,

03:34.240 --> 03:35.840
as the Yrr would have seen it.

03:36.080 --> 03:37.960
And remembered it.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.080
I don't understand.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.840
The Yrr must be capable of
some form of collective memory,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
passed down in their DNA
from generation to generation.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.400
Remembered it 250 million years.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.680
-Yes.
-And that's why they sent the message.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.480
To say what?

03:53.640 --> 03:55.680
To tell us that they have been

03:55.920 --> 03:58.640
and will be
here a lot longer than we have.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.680
And even though we evolved from the sea,

04:00.920 --> 04:04.600
that we share a common ancestry,
they aren't going to let us destroy it.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.840
But we believe that
the fact that they responded

04:10.080 --> 04:14.480
could be a signal from the Yrr
saying they're willing to talk.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.200
To call off their attack, to make peace.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.120
And now that you know what it is?

04:20.360 --> 04:22.720
We find out
everything we can about them,

04:22.880 --> 04:25.480
and release them back into the sea
where they belong.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.520
Hope you don't mind?
I needed to clear my head.

05:52.680 --> 05:55.000
Best view in the house, up here.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.200
Feels a bit different now,
knowing what's out there.

06:01.640 --> 06:07.120
1991, when I first came up here,
I was still in the Navy.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.680
All this was packed with ice,
even at this time of the year.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.120
We had to break our way through.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.240
And now...

06:21.400 --> 06:22.400
Well...

06:24.280 --> 06:26.280
I don't have to tell you that.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.680
No.

06:30.480 --> 06:33.760
It's nothing I didn't know. But it's...

06:35.400 --> 06:38.880
different, when you see it.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.120
Is there any chance you can reverse
what the Yrr did to her?

06:47.280 --> 06:51.760
We're testing several drugs now,
but if we find one, it's probably best

06:51.920 --> 06:55.000
to wait to get Alicia to the hospital
before we try it.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.440
I shouldn't have left her.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.000
You didn't know she was in danger.
None of us did.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.920
Charlie said she saw something.

07:04.880 --> 07:07.480
-If I'd listened to her...
-Luther.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.880
You have no reason to blame yourself.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.440
Okay?

07:21.880 --> 07:23.480
I have to get back to the lab.

07:23.640 --> 07:26.720
If you could sit with her for a while,
maybe talk to her a little?

07:27.840 --> 07:29.360
Can she hear anything?

07:29.520 --> 07:34.040
She might be able to pick up some
sounds, and sense someone's here.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.960
-If you think it will help.
-I do.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.360
Okay.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.280
Is it safe to handle?

08:01.440 --> 08:05.200
If there were a risk of airborne
infection, we would have known by now.

08:05.440 --> 08:09.400
So as long as we avoid direct contact
with it, we should be fine.

08:09.560 --> 08:13.200
I don't think they were trying
to kill Alicia when they entered her.

08:15.640 --> 08:16.880
What do you mean?

08:17.480 --> 08:19.840
I think they were trying to find out
about us.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.440
They could have
found out about us anytime.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.080
Why now?

08:24.680 --> 08:27.040
It's the first time
we tried to communicate with them.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.080
Before we did, they probably had no idea
we were even intelligent.

08:30.320 --> 08:34.680
If the Yrr have discovered that we're
more intelligent than they thought,

08:34.840 --> 08:37.800
then they will also know
that we're more dangerous.

09:22.280 --> 09:25.600
-Is that a humpback?
-It's an infant.

09:27.640 --> 09:30.200
We put a ban
on hunting humpback whales in the 1960s,

09:30.360 --> 09:33.200
when the population
was heading for extinction,

09:33.440 --> 09:35.480
down to fewer than five hundred whales.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.360
Last count,
there were over twenty-five thousand.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.480
It's one of the few things
we've done right.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.440
Which the Yrr might know.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.480
And if they do?

09:53.680 --> 09:57.640
We encode the humpback-whale sound
into the Yrr signal, send it out.

09:58.440 --> 10:01.320
To tell them we care?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.160
That we can change.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.800
Let's get started.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.400
-You wanted to see me.
-Come in.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.400
Please.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.600
Your Chief Officer, Mr. Kofi...

10:25.760 --> 10:27.240
What about him?

10:28.240 --> 10:31.120
-He's from Nigeria.
-Yes, he is.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.840
-He has family there?
-In Lekki, yes.

10:47.200 --> 10:49.400
Would you tell me what this is about?

10:56.440 --> 10:57.440
Please.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.400
-When did it hit?
-We just got word now.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.400
Musa.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.640
Let's step outside.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
-It's dead.
-Yes.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.320
-What killed it?
-Ketamine.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.880
It's standard issue in emergency rooms.

13:37.040 --> 13:41.920
It blocks pain signals in the brain and
produces visual and auditory distortion,

13:42.080 --> 13:43.880
and a detachment from reality.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.640
Which is why
it is also used to get high.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.520
-Is it toxic?
-To humans, no.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.320
Unless it's taken in very high doses.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.080
To the Yrr, yes.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.160
-Dr. Roche...
-Yes?

13:59.320 --> 14:01.960
Do you think
it could be deployed against the Yrr?

14:03.440 --> 14:05.040
Beyond the lab?

14:07.720 --> 14:09.280
The test you are looking at

14:09.440 --> 14:11.960
was performed on
a handful of Yrr cells in a Petri dish.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.400
To take it to the entire collective,
that is another matter.

14:19.080 --> 14:20.760
We could test it in the moon pool.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.200
It's not the open ocean,
but it could give us an idea

14:24.440 --> 14:26.080
of its efficacy against the Yrr.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.080
Okay, wait, hold on.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.360
Hold on, we...

14:31.480 --> 14:35.720
Guys, we found the Yrr,
we communicated with them.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.720
-Why are we talking about killing them?
-Because we're under attack.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.800
They've spoken to us
because they're open to peace.

14:42.960 --> 14:46.120
Peace? They just destroyed
a large part of West Africa.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.440
-What peace are you talking about?
-Wait, no.

14:48.600 --> 14:52.200
The tsunami that hit Nigeria
would have been set in motion

14:52.360 --> 14:54.360
long before
we communicated with the Yrr.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.600
-There was no way to stop that.
-We have a weapon that works.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.080
-And we should use it.
-We don't know.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.920
We just don't know enough to determine

15:03.080 --> 15:05.200
how closely linked
the Yrr are to the environment.

15:05.440 --> 15:09.400
If we kill them, we could be causing
irreparable damage to life in the ocean.

15:09.560 --> 15:14.320
And Jasper... If the ocean dies, we die.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.760
-Dr. Johanson.
-Yes?

15:30.000 --> 15:32.840
If Dr. Roche is correct,

15:33.080 --> 15:36.040
if the Yrr know
we have something which can kill them,

15:37.200 --> 15:40.680
we will be able to negotiate
from a position of strength.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.600
When have we ever developed a weapon
we haven't used?

15:44.200 --> 15:45.640
If the rest of the world finds out

15:45.880 --> 15:49.960
we know who the enemy are,
and what the Yrr are capable of,

15:50.120 --> 15:52.800
they will throw
every weapon they have against them.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.760
If we want to minimize the damage to
the oceans, we should test the ketamine.

16:04.920 --> 16:08.000
See if it works,
if it can be used strategically.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.160
I agree.

16:11.360 --> 16:12.840
So do I.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.240
I think we need to know.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.360
Okay, let's do it.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.640
How did you know?

17:25.800 --> 17:26.800
What?

17:27.920 --> 17:30.040
That the Yrr didn't want to hurt Alicia?

17:31.040 --> 17:33.400
That they were just trying
to find out about us?

17:35.040 --> 17:37.920
I didn't. I just...

17:39.080 --> 17:40.560
felt it.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.120
Luther. Luther!

20:32.760 --> 20:35.840
-Kofi, report.
-Lost all power.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.560
DP is out.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.840
-And propulsion is gone.
-Morton?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.480
We're drifting.

20:57.080 --> 20:58.840
Luther! Luther!

21:03.000 --> 21:04.320
Captain!

21:26.600 --> 21:29.240
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

21:29.400 --> 21:32.400
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

21:40.320 --> 21:42.600
Cécile. Hey, hey, hey.

21:43.760 --> 21:44.880
He's gone.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.640
He's gone.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.240
Kofi, send out a mayday. Hit the GMDSS.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.480
Flight crew, prep the helo
for passenger evac.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.480
And get Johanson up to the bridge.

22:06.640 --> 22:07.880
Move.

23:29.680 --> 23:32.640
-Reboot system.
-We're losing control.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.720
We're not drifting.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.200
We're being pulled.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.400
Get down to the engine room.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.920
-Get us up and running.
-Right away, Captain.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.680
When the Yrr died,

24:08.760 --> 24:10.440
the scream they made...

24:11.240 --> 24:13.200
must have traveled out into the ocean.

24:17.600 --> 24:18.880
Status?

24:19.040 --> 24:21.600
There's a ship
at Longyearbyen in Svalbard.

24:21.840 --> 24:25.760
ETA: One-seven hours.
No word on air-sea rescue.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.960
We know how to kill them.

24:50.640 --> 24:51.640
Yeah.

24:51.800 --> 24:56.040
So why aren't we pouring every drop
that we have into that ocean?

24:56.200 --> 24:58.560
We killed a handful of the Yrr

24:58.720 --> 25:01.360
in a moon pool on a ship
in the middle of the ocean,

25:01.520 --> 25:03.200
and look how the Yrr responded.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.080
Now? We would have to kill them all.

25:10.160 --> 25:15.200
There's 1.35 billion trillion liters
of water in the ocean.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.760
Now you tell me how anybody,
anywhere in the world,

25:17.920 --> 25:20.680
could ever create
that amount of ketamine.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.600
We wanted to show them

25:24.320 --> 25:27.040
that we had a weapon
that we could use against them.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.200
Now they know.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.480
Our only chance right now, Jasper...

25:36.360 --> 25:37.840
is to make peace.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.200
I'll try to keep us afloat
as long as I can.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.000
We have to let them know.

26:31.800 --> 26:35.880
We have to let the Yrr know
that we understand their message.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.000
That we're a part of them.

26:41.120 --> 26:44.560
Just like our children,
our grandchildren, are a part of us.

26:46.320 --> 26:47.720
How?

26:50.600 --> 26:53.680
Sam, do you think
you can get through to them?

26:56.600 --> 26:58.960
We have a message ready to send out,

26:59.120 --> 27:01.760
if we can get the equipment
back up and running.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.280
Okay.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.120
Charlie, can you pilot the HOV
by yourself?

27:07.760 --> 27:09.920
-I think so.
-Okay.

27:10.160 --> 27:13.520
If we inject Roscovitz with the Yrr,
there's a chance

27:13.680 --> 27:16.960
they'll bind with his cells
like they tried to do with Alicia's.

27:17.560 --> 27:20.120
That they'll merge and become one.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.320
We inject Roscovitz,

27:23.480 --> 27:26.640
Charlie will take him out in the HOV,

27:26.800 --> 27:28.800
and release him into the Yrr.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.440
Why not just
lower his body into the ocean?

27:37.520 --> 27:38.760
No.

27:42.040 --> 27:44.120
It should be as deep as possible,

27:44.280 --> 27:47.280
where the concentration of the Yrr
is greater.

28:13.880 --> 28:15.920
We need to get everyone we can

28:16.080 --> 28:17.560
off the ship.

28:18.280 --> 28:19.760
Cécile.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.600
You should go. Take Alicia and go.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.600
You've been away from your children
long enough.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.640
Sara.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.440
Go with them. See that they have
everything they need.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.600
Yes.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.600
Sara...
Help me get Alicia ready for the flight.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.840
Okay.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.520
-Sam?
-I'm on it.

28:47.400 --> 28:50.000
Leon, go with Charlie.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.880
Help her get ready.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.000
Riku.

29:05.200 --> 29:06.440
You'll go with them.

29:07.560 --> 29:10.560
The work we've started
isn't finished yet.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.640
She's ready,
you can take her up to the deck.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.960
-I'll be up as soon as I can.
-Okay.

29:58.520 --> 29:59.960
Captain.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.040
Two minutes. Any longer, go.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.880
-What do you think?
-Dr. Roche.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.520
You have to head up.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.960
There's a chance
his white blood cells are still alive.

31:18.120 --> 31:21.040
If they are,
they might fuse with the Yrr.

31:21.280 --> 31:25.040
In the chest, right above the heart.
Just before you release him. Okay?

31:26.280 --> 31:27.280
Okay.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.360
Alright. Hold it up.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.520
Alright.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.200
Someone will be with you
the whole time. Alright?

32:11.440 --> 32:12.440
Yeah.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.720
-What is it?
-The ice. We're not getting through.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.720
Charlie, do you copy?

33:53.640 --> 33:55.680
Charlie, do you copy?

33:57.280 --> 33:59.880
-Do you copy, Charlie?
-I hear you, Sigur.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.600
Would you put this on the speaker?

34:10.320 --> 34:12.320
-Charlie?
-Yes?

34:13.080 --> 34:15.920
The Captain's going to talk you through.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.520
Check your rate of descent.

34:19.760 --> 34:21.440
As you start to speed up,

34:23.200 --> 34:27.520
just keep bleeding some air into the
variable buoyancy system to compensate.

34:27.680 --> 34:30.520
It's just like
using your BC on a scuba dive.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.160
Remember.

34:34.040 --> 34:35.400
Got it.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.600
We don't know how fast
these things can move,

34:37.760 --> 34:41.760
so set the sector-scanning sonar
for a narrow fast-scan ahead.

34:41.920 --> 34:45.040
Then you can just turn the sub
for a wider search arc, okay?

34:45.200 --> 34:46.440
Yes.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.320
Watch your heading on the gyrocompass,

34:50.480 --> 34:53.040
and nose her into any current
if you need to.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.480
Heading is holding steady.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.120
If your trim starts to drift,

35:01.280 --> 35:03.720
nudge the ballast-tank balance
if you need to.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.240
Anything?

35:09.240 --> 35:10.800
Lower the frequency.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.800
I think we're through.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.440
I'm picking something up.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.760
What do you see?

36:04.200 --> 36:05.960
What do you see, Charlie?

36:22.840 --> 36:24.320
They're here.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.440
The Yrr.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.920
Leading down into the deep.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.680
Charlie, we're losing you.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.880
Charlie, do you copy? Charlie?

37:15.760 --> 37:17.240
You're break...

37:19.800 --> 37:22.600
You're breaking up... Captain, you...

37:22.760 --> 37:24.160
Charlie.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.000
He's too far gone.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.680
Can you hear me?

37:29.840 --> 37:31.640
Sigur? Can you hear...

37:31.800 --> 37:33.560
I didn't get that.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.360
I can't hear you.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.720
Luther is too far gone.
We can't risk it.

37:39.480 --> 37:40.520
She's...

37:41.120 --> 37:43.040
Charlie, stick to the plan.

37:43.640 --> 37:45.560
We only have one chance.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.320
And I'm going to take it.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.760
I'm not afraid. They won't hurt...

37:52.920 --> 37:53.920
Charlie.

37:54.640 --> 37:55.920
Charlie.

37:56.160 --> 38:00.200
Charlie,
the pressure alone will kill you.

38:04.720 --> 38:05.720
Charlie.

38:06.920 --> 38:08.000
Charlie.

38:09.800 --> 38:10.800
Charlie!

38:14.200 --> 38:15.240
Charlie!

38:16.200 --> 38:17.200
Charlie!

42:10.440 --> 42:12.280
Captain! The ice.
