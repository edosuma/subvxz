00:08.200 --> 00:10.400
I think we should
call it a night, sir.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.650
The Swamp Monster
has been seen around here.

00:12.651 --> 00:16.350
Nonsense! I need to finish this hole
to stay in the tournament.

00:16.351 --> 00:19.350
Plus, there's no such thing as
a Swamp Monster.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.000
It's the Swamp Monster!

00:25.050 --> 00:28.100
You big scaredy caddy.
That's just a bird.

00:28.101 --> 00:30.800
Fine!
I'll finish by myself.

We know you're one in a million
Scooby-Doo

01:02.701 --> 01:05.850
We can count on you, Scooby-Doo

01:05.851 --> 01:09.100
To catch and unmask that villain

01:09.750 --> 01:11.250
"REVENGE OF THE
SWAMP MONSTER!"

01:23.050 --> 01:25.400
Hang on, dudes,
I got to take this.

01:25.401 --> 01:29.250
You got the Shagster!
Speak it, don't freak it.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.200
Golf tournament?
Come be your caddy?

01:34.650 --> 01:36.150
Okay!

01:36.151 --> 01:39.000
I'll do it!
Pick us up, dude.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.850
Yikes! We gotta go!
Big doings!

01:44.851 --> 01:48.350
Hold the phone! Who'd send Shaggy
a private helicopter?

01:48.351 --> 01:51.100
- An old friend.
- A rich old friend.

01:51.101 --> 01:54.400
Then let's see who this Beeman
of Alcatraz really is.

01:54.401 --> 01:57.100
- Quickly!
- Bob the Beekeeper!

01:57.101 --> 01:58.601
Yup, didn't see that coming.

01:58.602 --> 02:01.000
All yours, boys.
Take him away.

02:06.350 --> 02:09.100
And I would have
got away with it...

02:10.350 --> 02:14.500
- What did he say?
- You know, the usual!

02:20.250 --> 02:22.650
Shaggy, where are
we going again?

02:22.651 --> 02:24.600
Lost Springs Golf Course,
Florida.

02:24.601 --> 02:26.800
Why does that sound familiar?

02:27.100 --> 02:29.200
Right.
Here it is.

02:29.201 --> 02:32.850
Several golfers have gone missing
in freak accidents there this week.

02:32.851 --> 02:34.351
Not surprising.

02:34.352 --> 02:37.500
Golf is like the most
dangerous sport there is, man.

02:37.501 --> 02:40.300
The horror!
Dude, the horror!

02:40.301 --> 02:43.600
Well, the rumor is, some horrible
Swamp Monster is taking them.

02:43.601 --> 02:45.350
Swamp Monster!

02:45.351 --> 02:47.000
Like, gulp.

02:50.450 --> 02:52.200
<i>Heads up!</i>

02:52.500 --> 02:54.900
Basketball legend Chris Paul?

02:54.901 --> 02:56.450
Throw me some heat,
Shaggy man.

02:56.451 --> 02:58.000
What's up, C.P.?

03:01.300 --> 03:03.500
I'm so glad you're gonna
caddy for me

03:03.501 --> 03:06.050
'cause I gotta bring my A-game
in this tournament.

03:06.051 --> 03:10.050
No way! That was before I heard
about some gooky Swamp Monster.

03:10.051 --> 03:12.500
No, no, no.
Ain't no backing out now.

03:12.501 --> 03:14.150
I saved your life once.
Remember?

03:14.151 --> 03:16.300
I need you, Shaggy!

03:17.500 --> 03:19.650
Quite right.
Copy that.

03:19.651 --> 03:22.500
Well, you called the right
mystery solvers, Mr. Paul.

03:22.501 --> 03:25.100
We'll find the truth behind
your Swamp Monster.

03:25.101 --> 03:26.650
It's what we do.

03:47.500 --> 03:51.000
<i>So, this is the school.</i>
It means a lot to me.

03:51.001 --> 03:53.450
So, Mr. Paul,
this art school is funded

03:53.451 --> 03:56.450
- by the golf tournament?
- Yeah, and if it doesn't happen,

03:56.451 --> 03:58.250
the school will be
forced to close.

03:58.251 --> 04:00.450
And that can't happen.

04:00.451 --> 04:03.200
Better get used to it
not being here, Mr. Paul.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.650
With half the golfers missing
or having quit

04:05.651 --> 04:07.550
because of that
horrible Swamp Monster,

04:07.551 --> 04:10.150
we might as well pack up
and go home now!

04:10.151 --> 04:12.500
Boy, she's a negative Nelly.

04:12.501 --> 04:14.600
You know it, Fred.
But listen here.

04:14.601 --> 04:17.250
- She is not why I'm doing this.
- We are!

04:17.250 --> 04:20.149
It's kind of my thing to promote
healthy activities for kids.

04:20.151 --> 04:22.700
- Like teaching them basketball?
- No.

04:22.701 --> 04:24.300
- By golfing?
- No.

04:24.301 --> 04:25.801
Bowling!

04:25.802 --> 04:27.302
Let me get this right.

04:27.303 --> 04:29.800
Basketball legend
and assist king, Chris Paul...

04:29.801 --> 04:33.200
- Is playing in a golf tournament...
- To save an art school...

04:33.201 --> 04:34.900
So he can teach them bowling?

04:34.901 --> 04:36.401
Now, you're getting it.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.300
I invented these outdoor
bowling lanes

04:38.301 --> 04:40.250
so everyone can enjoy bowling

04:40.251 --> 04:42.800
and be outside
at the same time.

04:42.801 --> 04:44.850
Is it bowling time, Mr. Paul?

04:44.851 --> 04:46.351
Yeah, she knows.

04:46.352 --> 04:49.800
- Thanks, C.P.
- It's always bowling time.

04:56.150 --> 04:58.950
Look at me, C.P.,
I'm bowling.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.600
Chris!

05:13.601 --> 05:16.100
- Help!
- Hang on!

05:16.101 --> 05:17.601
Yikes!

05:18.600 --> 05:20.100
No!

05:34.950 --> 05:37.400
- Like, what was that?
- It's a sinkhole.

05:37.401 --> 05:40.000
Sometimes during droughts
or bad weather,

05:40.001 --> 05:41.800
sinkholes will collapse.

05:41.801 --> 05:45.100
This school is doomed!
Doomed, I say.

05:47.850 --> 05:50.400
<i>Welcome, everyone,
to the last 18 holes</i>

05:50.401 --> 05:52.300
<i>of the Lost Waters Fundraiser
Tournament.</i>

05:52.301 --> 05:54.250
Let's meet
the top three remaing golfers

05:54.251 --> 05:56.500
who haven't been taken
by the Swamp Monster.

05:56.501 --> 06:01.150
Burt Friendly, professional nice guy
and local land developer.

06:01.151 --> 06:04.400
Land developer?
Okay, it's probably that guy.

06:04.401 --> 06:07.750
Our local curmudgeon
and self-proclaimed child hater

06:07.751 --> 06:10.750
and art despiser, Arthur C. Habernackle.

06:13.751 --> 06:16.200
Angry child hater
and art despiser?

06:16.201 --> 06:17.800
It's probably that guy.

06:17.801 --> 06:20.900
And the owner of the golf course,
Hadlee P. Jones,

06:20.901 --> 06:24.450
who's been trying to buy the land
from under the art school for years.

06:24.451 --> 06:26.550
So, it's probably,
definitely him.

06:26.551 --> 06:28.300
Let's see if we can
find any clues

06:28.301 --> 06:30.650
about these
crazy Swamp Monster sightings.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.400
Good luck in
the tournament, Mr. Paul.

06:32.401 --> 06:34.450
Thanks, Fred,
but don't need luck.

06:34.451 --> 06:37.700
Got my swag on.
And I got Shaggy.

06:42.450 --> 06:44.250
Here you go, C.P.

06:44.251 --> 06:45.751
No, this one.

06:45.752 --> 06:47.252
No, this is good.

06:47.253 --> 06:50.650
No. Here, try this one.
Wait, this one's good.

06:50.651 --> 06:52.151
Kidding.

06:52.152 --> 06:54.350
This is it. Right. Check.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.000
Wait!

07:08.299 --> 07:09.799
Man!

07:09.800 --> 07:11.950
Like, shake it off, C.P.,
it's still early.

07:11.951 --> 07:14.250
You can still
win this thing, dude!

07:22.100 --> 07:24.600
Man, I couldn't hit a ball
into the ocean.

07:24.601 --> 07:28.300
- Any advice, main man?
- Golf is like a sandwich.

07:28.349 --> 07:30.650
It's important to have
the right balance.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.500
You know how the bread
sits exactly

07:32.501 --> 07:34.450
on top of the corn beef
and sauerkraut,

07:34.451 --> 07:36.300
but you need just
the right amount of mustard

07:36.301 --> 07:39.500
on top and the bottom.
You know what I'm saying?

07:41.500 --> 07:44.600
Right amount of mustard, yeah...

07:51.650 --> 07:54.600
Shoot, Shaggy,
that was some sick advice.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.900
Advice?
Like, what advice?

07:57.901 --> 08:00.900
Like, I'm just hungry, dude.
I was making a sand-wish.

08:00.901 --> 08:04.600
It's like when you're wishing
you had a sandwich, but you don't.

08:04.601 --> 08:07.899
I called that a "sand-wish."

08:07.900 --> 08:10.400
Pretty sand-wish.

08:17.365 --> 08:20.800
<i>It's been a solid day of golf here
at Lost Waters</i>

08:20.801 --> 08:23.150
because there is not
a Swamp Monster in sight.

08:23.151 --> 08:26.250
I'm still hopeful this tournament
is actually going to finish

08:26.251 --> 08:28.800
and the school
will get the charity money.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.000
Swamp Monster!

08:45.300 --> 08:46.800
Where'd they go?

08:46.801 --> 08:49.000
Squirrels, hello?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.750
We are continuing now.

08:55.751 --> 08:58.800
I see guys. They have sticks.

08:58.801 --> 09:02.700
They're hitting the ground.
No, they're hitting a little white ball.

09:02.701 --> 09:05.550
Wait a minute!
The Swamp Monster is out of the water.

09:05.551 --> 09:07.750
Wait now.
He's on the green in two steps.

09:07.751 --> 09:09.500
He's chasing that golfer.

09:09.950 --> 09:12.050
Mr. Paul is in the weeds.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.250
And Shaggy is hiding.

09:17.850 --> 09:20.100
Look out, Shaggy. Look out!

09:24.600 --> 09:26.550
The Swamp Monster has turned.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
This looks bad... For me.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.900
Help!

09:34.000 --> 09:35.600
Get him off me. Help!

09:35.601 --> 09:38.500
Swamp Monster!

09:38.501 --> 09:40.950
Get him off me!

09:44.150 --> 09:45.650
Where did he go?

09:45.750 --> 09:50.700
Gang, looks like we've got
a real mystery on our hands.

09:54.500 --> 09:56.400
Not one clue.

09:56.401 --> 09:58.650
It doesn't make sense
how the Swamp Monster comes

09:58.651 --> 10:00.500
and goes without
leaving a trace.

10:00.501 --> 10:02.951
It doesn't make sense how
they leave these hotdogs uneaten

10:02.950 --> 10:04.450
at the end of the day.

10:04.451 --> 10:06.300
It's like
a crime or something.

10:06.301 --> 10:09.300
- Let's smash 'em.
- Pass me the dog, dog.

10:09.301 --> 10:11.450
- Yeah!
- You got it.

10:11.451 --> 10:13.349
Scooby, behind the back,
ankle breaker,

10:13.350 --> 10:14.850
double crossover, wide step,

10:14.916 --> 10:16.850
in and out, wrap around,
spin move, between the legs,

10:16.851 --> 10:19.450
wide open, he takes the shot.
It's good.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.350
Heads up!

10:30.000 --> 10:33.900
It's a scuba divers regulator,
for breathing underwater.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.200
I think I just got an idea.

10:51.800 --> 10:54.500
Time to do a little cave diving.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.650
This water trap is what
they call a blue hole.

11:08.651 --> 11:11.650
And it's connected
to the underground aquifer system.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.400
These caves go on for miles.

11:26.401 --> 11:28.550
Look. What's that?

11:29.250 --> 11:30.950
Scuba tanks?

11:32.950 --> 11:34.750
And they're all full.

11:34.751 --> 11:37.200
Why does a monster
need scuba tanks?

11:37.201 --> 11:40.399
Probably because he isn't
a real monster, Scooby-Doo?

11:40.400 --> 11:41.900
You said it, Mr. Paul.

11:41.901 --> 11:44.200
There are no such things
as monsters.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.300
Like, run.
Run for your lives!

11:49.301 --> 11:52.550
I mean, like, swim. Swim.
Swim for your lives!

12:01.000 --> 12:02.500
Guys!

12:15.600 --> 12:17.100
Up there!

12:22.200 --> 12:24.350
We're at the Art School.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.700
And so is that monster.

12:58.450 --> 12:59.950
There you are.

12:59.951 --> 13:01.800
Like, hurry up, dude.
You're late.

13:01.801 --> 13:03.350
Sit down, sit down.

13:03.351 --> 13:05.300
<i>All right, class.
Settle down.</i>

13:05.301 --> 13:08.400
This is an art school,
so I'm teaching art.

13:08.401 --> 13:10.250
In painting, as in life,

13:10.251 --> 13:14.399
the secret to doing anything
is believing that you can do it.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.650
We never make mistakes.
We just make happy accidents.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.750
What you'll got
going on back there?

13:25.500 --> 13:28.350
Is that you?
That's cute.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.300
Yikes! Run!

13:42.300 --> 13:43.850
Fire drill!

13:51.700 --> 13:55.250
Some people just don't understand
the value of staying in school.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.300
Something dropped
out of his pocket.

13:57.301 --> 13:59.850
- He's got pockets?
- It's a compass.

13:59.851 --> 14:02.600
Not any old compass.
A prismatic compass.

14:02.601 --> 14:05.950
- A kind used by geologists.
- And land surveyors.

14:05.951 --> 14:07.451
Interesting.

14:07.452 --> 14:10.150
Boys, girls, and famous
basketball legends,

14:10.151 --> 14:13.300
this mystery is really starting
to come together.

14:13.301 --> 14:16.450
<i>Well, folks, we're down
to our last holes of golf,</i>

14:16.451 --> 14:18.300
<i>and our last remaing golfers.</i>

14:18.301 --> 14:20.900
<i>Seems that Swamp Monster</i>
has been very busy.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.250
So let's hope at least one
of our golfers

14:23.251 --> 14:25.400
can survive till the end.

14:31.500 --> 14:35.400
- Yikes!
- It's just me, Mr. Rogers. Dude!

14:35.401 --> 14:38.300
I can't believe I'm standing
next to Shaggy Rogers!

14:38.301 --> 14:40.100
Legend of Shaggy pants!

14:40.101 --> 14:42.650
Like, whoa, man.
Like, whoa!

14:42.651 --> 14:44.850
Like, okay, dude,
take it easy.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.050
I'm just a regular dude.

14:47.051 --> 14:48.800
I just came by
to warn you, dude.

14:48.801 --> 14:51.050
This place is cursed, man.

14:51.051 --> 14:54.100
That Swamp Monster is real,
and it's gonna get everybody.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.950
Get out while you can,
Mr. Rogers.

14:55.951 --> 14:58.000
Dude, it would be
a terrible shame

14:58.001 --> 15:00.500
if the world lost
a caddy like you.

15:02.700 --> 15:04.600
Yeah, shame.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.350
I don't think I can
go through with this.

15:07.351 --> 15:10.800
What? You have to.
Those kids are counting on us.

15:10.801 --> 15:14.100
I, I... I can't.

15:14.101 --> 15:17.700
Shaggy, remember,
I saved your life.

15:17.701 --> 15:19.201
Okay, that's it.

15:19.202 --> 15:22.299
I need to know how Mr. Paul
saved your life.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.100
Fine, Velma, but I warn you,
I warn all of you.

15:26.101 --> 15:29.100
Like, it's a pretty
challenging story to hear.

15:29.101 --> 15:30.800
The day Chris Paul
saved my life

15:30.801 --> 15:33.450
was possibly the scariest day
of my life.

15:33.451 --> 15:35.450
And that is saying something.

15:35.451 --> 15:38.650
I was in a tough fix.
I didn't know how I was gonna survive.

15:38.651 --> 15:41.400
Things looked so bleak.

15:41.401 --> 15:44.800
It was the end of the road,
and that's when...

15:46.800 --> 15:49.300
Chris Paul saved my life...

15:49.301 --> 15:51.450
by sharing his pizza with me.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.200
Wait. What?

15:54.201 --> 15:56.400
- That's it?
- Makes sense to me.

15:56.401 --> 15:58.100
That saved your life?

15:58.101 --> 16:01.450
Dude, I was so hungry.

16:01.451 --> 16:05.100
- I hadn't eaten in like three or four...
- Weeks?

16:05.101 --> 16:09.400
Hours! And, man,
that was one crazy great pizza.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.050
- Boy!
- Shoot, yeah.

16:12.051 --> 16:14.250
That pizza was bomb.

16:14.251 --> 16:16.600
And sharing it
with my guy right here

16:16.601 --> 16:20.100
meant I made a friend.
A friend for life.

16:20.101 --> 16:22.600
You're right, C.P., I'm in.

16:22.601 --> 16:24.800
Let's do this thing.

16:29.150 --> 16:30.900
Okay, here's the plan, Scooby.

16:30.901 --> 16:33.150
You stay with
Shaggy and Mr. Paul,

16:33.151 --> 16:35.850
Velma, Daphne, and I
will get the trap ready.

16:35.851 --> 16:39.800
Remember. It's vital
you make it to the 18th hole.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.100
Hold on.
Sorry there, Fred.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.601
What were y'all saying?

16:43.602 --> 16:46.150
We were just doing
our fist bump thingy.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.950
Okay, the trap's set.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.349
- Nice shot, C.P.
- Yeah.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.850
He's right there.

17:33.851 --> 17:35.800
The ball's right here,
Scooby-Doo.

17:35.801 --> 17:38.200
No! Monster!

17:40.150 --> 17:42.150
Man, I don't know about you all,

17:42.151 --> 17:44.000
but I think we better
pick up the pace.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.300
Why is that hat
floating out there?

18:02.250 --> 18:04.300
Where did
all the other golfers get to?

18:04.301 --> 18:07.250
Hello? Golfers?

18:07.251 --> 18:09.900
Golfers?

18:10.300 --> 18:11.800
There's somebody.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.150
- Or something.
- Swamp Monster.

18:16.151 --> 18:19.100
Like, run!
Run for our lives.

18:19.101 --> 18:20.750
I am not quitting.

18:20.751 --> 18:24.200
I'm the last golfer standing
and I'm gonna finish this game.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.800
So, like, golf.
Golf for our lives!

18:38.600 --> 18:40.100
Hit it!

19:04.000 --> 19:06.700
Hurry, Scoob,
he's gaining on us.

19:06.701 --> 19:09.000
Speedy-Dooby-Doo!

19:22.300 --> 19:24.200
It's coming right at us!

19:31.050 --> 19:32.550
I got this.

19:32.551 --> 19:36.200
<i>Chris Paul has the ball
and he is driving for the hole.</i>

19:37.600 --> 19:40.300
Like an ankle breaker. Yeah.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.500
Foul! That was totally a foul.

19:44.501 --> 19:47.100
Scooby, Shaggy, pull the flag.

19:50.700 --> 19:52.200
Run!

20:07.550 --> 20:11.300
Now, let's see who
this Swamp Monster really is.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.100
The caddy?

20:13.101 --> 20:15.150
Searching local
university records,

20:15.151 --> 20:18.350
I found our caddy here
had been attending night school

20:18.351 --> 20:21.600
- as a land surveyor.
- He saved all his tips

20:21.601 --> 20:23.800
and had accumulated
a large sum of money.

20:23.801 --> 20:26.250
Working on the golf course
gave him extensive knowledge

20:26.251 --> 20:28.150
of the underground
aquifer system.

20:28.151 --> 20:29.651
You're darn right it did!

20:29.652 --> 20:31.950
I knew if I could make
the school go under,

20:31.951 --> 20:33.451
I'd pick up the land for cheap

20:33.452 --> 20:35.800
and build a bunch of
really expensive condos on it.

20:35.801 --> 20:37.301
I'd be rich.

20:37.302 --> 20:39.050
But what about
the crazy monster strength?

20:39.051 --> 20:41.100
- How did that work?
- It's all him.

20:41.101 --> 20:42.750
The costume
made him look bigger,

20:42.751 --> 20:45.050
and years of caddying
and swinging golf clubs

20:45.051 --> 20:47.700
- made him freakishly strong.
- Total truth.

20:47.701 --> 20:51.300
Like being in a golf job
gets you totally ripped, dude!

20:51.301 --> 20:53.700
Where did you think
I got this hot bod?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.900
And I would have
gotten away with it, too,

20:56.901 --> 20:59.100
if it wasn't for meddling
basketball legend

20:59.101 --> 21:02.400
and assist king
and bowling aficionado, Chris Paul,

21:02.401 --> 21:05.050
and caddying legend,
Shaggy Rogers.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.600
It seems that the local police
have rescued all the golfers

21:08.601 --> 21:10.101
taken by the Swamp Monster.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.900
Let's go live now to the moment
we've all been waiting for.

21:12.973 --> 21:14.700
The final putt.

21:14.701 --> 21:16.201
All right, C.P.

21:16.202 --> 21:18.450
Sink that putt
and save this school.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.250
I got this.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.900
Man!

21:39.950 --> 21:41.450
Man!

21:45.700 --> 21:47.200
Man!

21:52.750 --> 21:54.950
It's good!

21:55.400 --> 21:58.400
