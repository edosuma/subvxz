00:26.557 --> 00:28.353
This is a customer announcement.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.763
Head to aisle five for exciting
offers on fruit and veg.

00:36.740 --> 00:38.085
Ooh.

00:39.162 --> 00:41.021
Hey. I saw that first.

00:41.054 --> 00:43.046
And I got it first so tough titty.

00:45.122 --> 00:47.442
- Put that carrot back.
- How about we share it?

00:47.482 --> 00:49.625
I'll have the orange bit,
you have the green bit.

00:49.649 --> 00:52.689
- I'll tell my master.
- Ooh, scared!

00:52.802 --> 00:54.024
Master?

00:54.048 --> 00:58.414
This short man just took my
carrot directly out of the basket.

00:58.439 --> 01:00.164
Well, give it back, turd.

01:00.189 --> 01:03.003
That carrot is a vital
ingredient for my supper.

01:03.042 --> 01:04.962
It's pretty vital for mine an' all.

01:05.003 --> 01:07.882
I'm having beef and vegetable
stew. What are you having?

01:07.923 --> 01:10.811
- Carrot.
- Seize it from him, Terrence.

01:10.837 --> 01:13.917
- Ooh, yes. How do I...
- Seize it!

01:14.689 --> 01:16.170
Er...

01:16.194 --> 01:18.027
- Er...
- Hit him, go on.

01:18.058 --> 01:21.834
Ooh. Oh, yeah. You want some, do ya?

01:21.859 --> 01:24.362
- Slave fight!
- Slave fight...!

01:24.402 --> 01:26.242
Go on! That's it. Get off me.

01:26.283 --> 01:28.323
See how you like this, then, bugger-nuts!

01:28.362 --> 01:31.350
Ooh! Agh! Aaagh!

01:31.376 --> 01:33.003
My arm!

01:33.043 --> 01:34.406
Just this, please.

01:51.027 --> 01:54.034
- I can't find my clothes.
- So come back to bed.

01:54.060 --> 01:56.259
Yeah, not really a solution long-term.

01:56.284 --> 01:59.125
I had some clean pants and my tunic?

01:59.150 --> 02:01.457
Just take any tunic. No-one'll mind.

02:01.483 --> 02:05.611
Erm, I will. Er, sorry, have you
been in our bed the whole night?

02:05.635 --> 02:11.043
It's not your bed, Marcus. It's
communal. We share things here.

02:11.082 --> 02:14.723
Yeah, underwear, cutlery,
diseases. You're living the dream!

02:21.644 --> 02:22.963
Don't mind me.

02:23.933 --> 02:26.338
Where's your tunic?

02:26.364 --> 02:27.843
No idea. Someone stole it.

02:27.962 --> 02:30.883
In fact, no. Someone shared it.
Which apparently makes it fine.

02:30.923 --> 02:33.328
Those dirtbags just
move in on everything.

02:33.353 --> 02:36.883
Including my girlfriend. Maya is
all over her like an angry rash.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.522
I cannot go back to that
filthy fart farm. I swear.

02:43.252 --> 02:45.772
- Is this yours?
- Er, yes.

02:45.962 --> 02:48.962
Well, your slave broke my slave's arm.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.522
Oh. Did he? Right.

02:50.562 --> 02:52.375
Say sorry to the nice man, Grumio.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.079
- Eff off. He pushed me first.
- See? He's totally out of control.

02:56.203 --> 02:58.802
Yeah, I know. Welcome to my
world. I'm always saying that.

02:58.843 --> 03:00.379
So what are you going to do about it?

03:00.405 --> 03:02.842
I tend to just ignore it.
Rise above it if I can.

03:02.883 --> 03:06.454
This is my head slave that
your little lout savaged.

03:06.479 --> 03:09.899
Now, either you pay me 200
denarii for every day he misses,

03:09.924 --> 03:14.203
or I take your slave to fill
in until his arm gets fixed.

03:14.242 --> 03:17.004
- Yes, that one. The second one.
- Oh, you tight bastard.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.539
You brought this on yourself, Grumio.

03:18.564 --> 03:21.365
And if it teaches you how to be
a less shit slave, I'm all for it.

03:21.389 --> 03:23.341
Very well, then.

03:23.365 --> 03:26.810
And there's no such thing as
a bad slave. Just a bad master.

03:27.179 --> 03:28.899
Couldn't agree more.

03:31.664 --> 03:33.664
Can we swap ears in a bit?

03:37.883 --> 03:41.365
- Cracking gaff, this.
- Yes, well, we all work very hard,

03:41.390 --> 03:43.350
to keep our gaff cracking.

03:43.376 --> 03:45.536
Let me introduce the dream team.

03:45.814 --> 03:48.014
Alba here is our culinary whizz.

03:48.039 --> 03:49.728
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

03:49.752 --> 03:52.473
And this is Cato. He does
all the strong, boysy stuff.

03:52.497 --> 03:54.777
- Blimey, you're a big 'un, aren't ya?
- Cato is a mute.

03:55.163 --> 03:57.723
Something you would do
well to aspire to, gobby.

03:57.763 --> 04:01.448
This is Grumio. He's
kindly covering my work,

04:01.473 --> 04:04.082
after unkindly breaking my arm.

04:04.122 --> 04:07.213
So tomorrow morning you
will be up at 05:00am...

04:07.239 --> 04:10.082
05:00am?! Is that a real time?

04:10.122 --> 04:11.682
To prepare the master's bath.

04:11.723 --> 04:13.798
Cook his breakfast, serve his breakfast,

04:13.823 --> 04:17.483
empty his potty, wipe his botty,
change his sheets, rub his feet.

04:17.523 --> 04:20.843
- Then 11 o'clock nap time.
- Hmm, sounds like I'll need that.

04:20.882 --> 04:22.643
For the master, not for you.

04:22.682 --> 04:25.362
Now, follow me and I'll
show you your sleeping shelf.

04:28.014 --> 04:30.413
"...and plunging the
dagger deep into her heart,

04:30.444 --> 04:32.427
Dido leapt onto the burning pyre."

04:32.452 --> 04:35.896
Well, I don't think she's
coming back from that.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.523
Hey, Marcus, there's girl's
knickers hanging by the well.

04:39.562 --> 04:41.963
- I love this heat-wave.
- They're mine, Stylax.

04:42.002 --> 04:44.062
Should bring them in.
They're probably dry now.

04:44.086 --> 04:47.024
- Oh. Yeah, they did feel dry.
- I asked Delphine to move in for a bit.

04:47.048 --> 04:49.312
- Hope that's cool?
- Just while Grumio's away.

04:49.338 --> 04:52.610
- Hang on. Did you feel her knickers?
- Er, very cool.

04:52.634 --> 04:55.606
Yeah. So what's the plan
for tonight, then, roomies?

04:55.632 --> 04:57.886
Ah, yeah. You know that
guy who did the Georgics?

04:57.911 --> 04:58.622
Uh-huh.

04:58.622 --> 05:00.428
We're making our way through
his new one, the Aeneid.

05:00.454 --> 05:04.362
- Marcus got the full box-set.
- Cool. So could I do that, too?

05:04.394 --> 05:05.694
- Er, yeah.
- Yeah?

05:05.733 --> 05:08.350
I mean, it is quite plotty, so
we might have to start again.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.670
Oh, no. Come on. We're not
going back to the beginning.

05:10.694 --> 05:11.254
Er...

05:11.279 --> 05:13.338
No it's fine. Carry on. I'll pick it up.

05:13.362 --> 05:14.470
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:14.494 --> 05:15.791
Sure.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.235
"She screamed as the
flames caressed her legs..."

05:18.261 --> 05:19.978
- And who's doing that, sorry?
- Dido.

05:20.223 --> 05:21.815
She's just stabbed and burnt herself

05:21.841 --> 05:23.737
- because Aeneas is leaving.
- Ah, cool!

05:23.856 --> 05:26.158
- And who's he?
- He's the main character.

05:26.182 --> 05:27.822
- He's there because Troy got sacked.
- Right.

05:27.846 --> 05:29.485
Gotcha. So he's Troy's replacement.

05:30.036 --> 05:31.355
If Troy got sacked...

05:31.380 --> 05:34.012
What? No, Troy's not a person!

05:34.036 --> 05:36.473
No, it's Troy. As in
the Wooden Horse of Troy?

05:36.497 --> 05:38.824
- That the Greeks made.
- Right. Yeah, got it. Carry on.

05:39.283 --> 05:41.084
Er... yeah.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.262
"She screamed as the
flames caressed her leg..."

05:43.288 --> 05:46.682
- Sorry, there's a horse made of wood?
- Oh, for Jove's sake!

05:47.779 --> 05:49.899
Er, I might go for a walk.

05:50.322 --> 05:52.483
That's a thing people do, isn't it?

05:53.718 --> 05:55.233
Sorry.

05:57.754 --> 06:00.514
- Wash my feet, boy.
- Nah, you're all right.

06:00.562 --> 06:02.148
I've got a thing about feet.

06:02.173 --> 06:05.341
I've walked the filthy
streets all day because of you.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.283
Now wash your master's
feet, you little pillock.

06:08.322 --> 06:10.606
They say feet wash themselves
after a couple of weeks.

06:10.632 --> 06:12.278
They say that about hair.

06:12.302 --> 06:14.394
Well, you've got hairy feet.

06:14.418 --> 06:15.600
Now!

06:17.362 --> 06:20.002
â™ª This little piggy
went to market... â™ª

06:20.043 --> 06:23.322
In silence. It's meant to be relaxing.

06:23.697 --> 06:26.317
Agh! What sort of brush is that?!

06:26.343 --> 06:28.130
Dunno. I found it in the bog.

06:28.156 --> 06:30.047
You've got to get right
in t'cracks, ain't ya?

06:30.072 --> 06:32.531
Agh! No, stop. This is hateful.

06:32.557 --> 06:35.276
You are not to go near
my feet ever again.

06:35.302 --> 06:36.970
Oh. Nice one.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.000
- So are you on food-tasting now?
- What?

06:50.024 --> 06:52.457
No, I got time off for
bad behaviour, didn't I?

06:52.483 --> 06:54.963
Go on, tell us. What's your secret?

06:55.002 --> 06:58.122
Come on, quick sticks!
Master wants his vol-au-vents.

06:58.163 --> 07:01.605
Well, when they ask you to
do something, just do it badly

07:01.630 --> 07:03.706
- and they never ask you again.
- Back to work.

07:03.732 --> 07:06.824
- Do not listen to him...
- Or if you do it really badly,

07:06.848 --> 07:08.848
they actually step in
to show you how's it done

07:08.872 --> 07:10.547
and basically end up doing it for you.

07:10.572 --> 07:12.718
And that is not how we
do things in this house.

07:12.742 --> 07:15.483
As my late father used to
say, if something's worth doing

07:15.507 --> 07:17.120
- it's worth doing properly.
- Why?

07:17.146 --> 07:18.586
Because...

07:18.610 --> 07:20.012
Erm...

07:20.802 --> 07:22.490
Oh, be quiet!

07:22.514 --> 07:25.437
OK, I'm gonna drop some
next-level shit on you now.

07:25.461 --> 07:27.141
This is a technique I like to call

07:27.167 --> 07:30.286
"deliberately misunderstanding
until people give up asking".

07:32.867 --> 07:35.867
You and Delphine just need
a bit of time to bond is all.

07:35.954 --> 07:37.797
Maybe we'll do a night of
parlour games or something.

07:37.829 --> 07:39.196
It can be proper awks

07:39.220 --> 07:41.802
living with a couple, trust
me. I've done it for ages now.

07:41.827 --> 07:44.334
- Do you mean your parents?
- That's not awkward, that's tragic.

07:44.358 --> 07:45.853
No, it's not. I have my own door.

07:46.242 --> 07:47.834
And anyway, my parents
are away this week.

07:47.858 --> 07:50.615
So you know what that means. A
pool party at Aurelius's house!

07:50.639 --> 07:53.310
Yeah, "pool party" does sound cool,

07:53.336 --> 07:55.723
but "at Aurelius's house"
more than cancels is out.

07:55.762 --> 07:57.807
Then stick to your dorky
parlour games, mate.

07:57.831 --> 07:59.158
I prefer getting girl round

07:59.182 --> 08:01.406
for a bit of skinny-dipping
and fingering myself.

08:01.716 --> 08:03.666
- You finger yourself?
- What?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.490
- That's your pool party, is it?
- No, I...

08:05.514 --> 08:07.264
Just get in the pool
and prod yourself silly.

08:07.288 --> 08:09.021
- Girls, not me.
- It's more of a poo party.

08:09.045 --> 08:10.632
I am not gonna finger myself!

08:11.377 --> 08:13.139
Good for you, water boy.

08:13.165 --> 08:14.906
- Fight that urge.
- No.

08:14.930 --> 08:16.600
They were... just
doing some teasing about

08:16.624 --> 08:18.122
my oncoming pool party, water ma'am.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.819
Oh, yes. I got the invitation. Thank you.

08:20.843 --> 08:23.288
- Shredder.
- Have you got all the relevant details?

08:23.312 --> 08:26.576
I have. It's your
party so I'm not coming.

08:26.601 --> 08:28.990
There'll be cocktails. And onion rings!

08:38.750 --> 08:40.549
Focus, please. Alba.

08:40.575 --> 08:43.134
Sorry, master. Just trying my best.

08:46.048 --> 08:48.043
Just stop... Just stop it, then.

08:51.493 --> 08:53.921
Here you go, boss. Cheese board.

08:53.946 --> 08:56.399
What? Where's the cheese?

08:56.423 --> 08:58.841
Oh. I wondered why you
just wanted the board.

08:58.865 --> 09:02.831
A cheese board means a selection
of cheeses, you numbskull!

09:02.856 --> 09:06.202
- So you don't want the board, then?
- Yes, of course I want the board!

09:06.243 --> 09:08.711
I want a cheese board
of cheese, on a board,

09:08.735 --> 09:10.855
- and I want it an hour ago.
- Oh.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.999
- I don't know how to do all that.
- Right. That's it!

09:14.024 --> 09:16.024
I'm going to bed!

09:17.312 --> 09:18.993
Ow!

09:19.322 --> 09:21.845
Grumio, you're a genius!

09:21.870 --> 09:23.309
Ta.

09:23.335 --> 09:25.875
I was actually quite
confused for a lot of that.

09:25.900 --> 09:29.384
So what do we do now? We've
never had any time off before.

09:29.408 --> 09:31.024
I tend to sit down,

09:31.048 --> 09:33.789
maybe snaffle any food and
drink what's lying about.

09:33.815 --> 09:35.975
No, no. We must use this time

09:36.000 --> 09:38.953
to tick off some fiddly
jobs we never get round to.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.769
Polish the bronzies. Weed
the herbaceous border.

09:41.793 --> 09:44.682
- Oh, come on, man, live a little!
- Please.

09:45.243 --> 09:48.019
Well, I suppose a cheeky bottle
of the master's vino wouldn't hurt.

09:48.043 --> 09:49.899
Hmm, yeah.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.322
So this a game called "secrets".

09:53.363 --> 09:55.542
Whoever has the pebble
has to tell us something

09:55.567 --> 09:57.927
they've never told anyone. OK?

09:57.951 --> 10:01.291
I'll got first. I once
stole an abacus from school

10:01.316 --> 10:04.833
- and kept it under my bed.
- Whoa, Marcus, you total bad-ass!

10:04.859 --> 10:06.662
That's a very shit secret.

10:06.687 --> 10:08.763
- All right. What have you got?
- Er...

10:09.602 --> 10:12.278
When I was a teenager, I stole
some liver from the butcher's.

10:12.303 --> 10:14.769
- His one's just as tame.
- And then had sex with it.

10:14.794 --> 10:17.235
Ah. OK. That is worse.

10:17.403 --> 10:20.450
When I was growing up in
Gaul, me and my friends

10:20.475 --> 10:24.291
- set fire to the magistrate's house.
- Whoa!

10:24.316 --> 10:26.202
- What?!
- Your go, then, Marcus.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.018
Yeah. I'm mainly thinking about

10:28.043 --> 10:30.046
being trapped inside
a burning building now.

10:30.071 --> 10:32.149
Let's leave that. Who
wants to play charades?

10:32.173 --> 10:34.282
- Dunno. Old people?
- Ha! ÃƒÂ‰xactement!

10:34.307 --> 10:37.082
Yeah!

10:37.106 --> 10:38.115
Great stuff.

10:38.140 --> 10:41.109
I'd rather you two didn't bond
over a mutual mockery of me, though.

10:41.134 --> 10:43.201
I've got a Gallic
drinking game we can play.

10:43.225 --> 10:44.682
Oh, yeah. Let's do that.

10:44.682 --> 10:48.171
- OK. What are the rules?
- We drink as much wine as we can.

10:49.643 --> 10:52.403
- Sounds good.
- Yeah, not really rules, are they?

11:17.892 --> 11:19.099
Time for more wine.

11:19.124 --> 11:21.283
Oh, no. I'm absolutely hammered.

11:21.308 --> 11:23.106
I think we should just go to bed.

11:23.130 --> 11:24.413
OK.

11:25.009 --> 11:26.552
Maybe we should.

11:37.455 --> 11:39.014
What was that?

11:39.243 --> 11:41.802
- Maybe it's a French thing.
- It is a French thing.

11:41.842 --> 11:44.397
It's called a menage-a-trois,
AKA three-way,

11:44.422 --> 11:47.883
- AKA the only French words I know.
- OK. Yeah.

11:47.923 --> 11:49.889
Shit. Well, we're
obviously not doing that.

11:49.913 --> 11:50.591
Sure.

11:50.592 --> 11:52.947
Devil's advocate for a
sec. I think we should.

11:52.971 --> 11:55.582
- What? No. Why would I want that?
- Well, think about it.

11:55.607 --> 11:58.289
It'll be you, the woman you
love and your best friend.

11:58.315 --> 12:01.135
- What could be better?
- You not being there. Clearly.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.475
You just wanna have sex.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.386
- You may as well have a go on some liver.
- Wha...

12:04.412 --> 12:07.105
- Have we got any liver?
- Nah. We've got mince.

12:07.638 --> 12:09.379
Nah, that's not... Oh, come on, man.

12:09.442 --> 12:11.523
We'll be laughing about
it in years to come.

12:11.554 --> 12:12.791
- You think?
- Yeah.

12:12.823 --> 12:15.533
What if me and Delphine get married?
Will we be laughing about it then?

12:15.566 --> 12:17.580
At my wedding. Where you're the best man.

12:17.605 --> 12:20.658
There won't even be a wedding
if she thinks you're a saddo

12:20.682 --> 12:23.123
who loves maths and hates three-ways.

12:23.163 --> 12:24.649
I mean... Oh, quick. She's coming back.

12:24.674 --> 12:26.524
- OK. Don't look me in the eye.
- I won't.

12:26.549 --> 12:28.072
- Or in the privates.
- Yep.

12:28.096 --> 12:29.407
Or make any unnecessary skin contact.

12:29.432 --> 12:30.934
You won't even know I'm there.

12:43.755 --> 12:46.436
Well, no-one can say you haven't bonded.

13:15.693 --> 13:17.134
Oh, what have we done?

13:17.327 --> 13:20.270
Oh, Jove! Oh, we have to tidy up at once.

13:20.296 --> 13:23.481
I wouldn't bother. It's only
gonna get dirty again, innit?

13:23.506 --> 13:26.606
Well, yes, I suppose that is
true. What do you recommend, then?

13:26.647 --> 13:29.018
Go out for a fry-up, some fresh air

13:29.043 --> 13:30.807
and have a bottle of
plonk to take the edge off,

13:30.846 --> 13:32.486
- we're sound as a pound.
- Yes!

13:32.527 --> 13:35.966
Outside. I've not been
there for three years.

13:36.006 --> 13:38.366
Why has no-one come to tie my toga?

13:38.407 --> 13:40.726
Right. Yes. Off we go, then.

13:43.846 --> 13:45.366
Follow me.

13:45.669 --> 13:49.206
Ohh, ohhh! Stylax banged your missus?

13:49.246 --> 13:51.701
You saw each other's
stiffies, you dirty pervs!

13:51.726 --> 13:53.749
We made a pact not to look, actually.

13:53.774 --> 13:57.126
And Stylax's stiffy was fairly
well hidden inside my girlfriend.

13:57.167 --> 14:00.354
- While I was reduced to boob duty.
- Well, no, it was a team effort.

14:00.379 --> 14:02.486
- You were making her moan, man.
- When was that?

14:02.527 --> 14:05.006
- When I accidently knelt on her hair?
- Ha.

14:05.032 --> 14:07.568
OK, well, I am happy to go on
boob duty tonight, if you want?

14:07.594 --> 14:10.953
Er, it's not happening again.
It was a one-off, drunken mistake.

14:10.979 --> 14:13.086
- We're some kind of throuple!
- All right, fine.

14:13.126 --> 14:16.000
But if at any point you need me, just
whistle. I'll be there in 5 seconds.

14:16.025 --> 14:18.807
- What, like a sort of sex dog?
- A bit like a sex dog.

14:18.846 --> 14:20.696
I don't want to live with a sex dog!

14:20.721 --> 14:22.774
I wish the sex dog had
never been let of its leash!

14:22.798 --> 14:27.006
Oh, Stylax, man, you have spunked
on your own doorstep, dude.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.563
You should totally come and stay at mine.

14:28.588 --> 14:29.686
Hell, no!

14:29.687 --> 14:32.984
Well, hear him out. It's not a bad idea.

14:33.009 --> 14:34.529
- He's having a pool party.
- I am.

14:34.553 --> 14:35.661
With cocktails.

14:35.686 --> 14:37.466
- And onion rings.
- And ladies.

14:37.490 --> 14:39.173
And ladies. You like ladies.

14:39.249 --> 14:41.366
I say "pool", you say "party".

14:41.407 --> 14:42.649
Pool!

14:43.567 --> 14:45.287
Are you waiting for me to say "party"?

14:45.326 --> 14:48.567
Pool party! Yes. That counts. Pool party!

14:49.927 --> 14:52.647
Well, I loved it. I'm
always up for a threesome.

14:52.687 --> 14:56.606
Would've preferred a good threesome,
"two girls, one guy" version but...

14:56.647 --> 14:59.687
Yeah, sadly, Stylax couldn't
cope and had to move out.

14:59.726 --> 15:03.048
- It's so weird.
- Yeah, well, you say that.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.860
He can be very closed-minded, sexually.

15:05.884 --> 15:08.118
Really? He's had sex with liver.

15:08.143 --> 15:10.246
Yeah, that's the
problem. He prefers liver.

15:10.287 --> 15:14.171
He's a real liver lover.
He can't relate to people.

15:14.296 --> 15:16.787
He was relating pretty well last night.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.745
So what should we do with his room, then?

15:19.746 --> 15:21.961
Walk-in wardrobe? Panic room?

15:21.986 --> 15:23.826
Bondage den?

15:23.866 --> 15:26.226
Is that Grumio?

15:26.251 --> 15:27.898
Oh, yeah. Huh. He's grown.

15:27.923 --> 15:30.187
Oi, Grumio! Over here.

15:30.226 --> 15:31.775
Cato, nine o'clock.

15:31.801 --> 15:33.615
Sorry, no, two o'clock.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.346
Or five o'clock maybe.

15:35.386 --> 15:37.667
Over here, basically. All right, Marcus?

15:37.706 --> 15:40.140
Yeah, thanks. Made some
new friends, have you?

15:40.165 --> 15:41.841
Oh, yeah, they're a right laugh this lot.

15:41.865 --> 15:44.378
Can I just say, I fucking love this guy.

15:44.403 --> 15:45.787
Love you, too, Terrence.

15:45.826 --> 15:48.062
Come on, gang, let's
go and get some crepes.

15:48.086 --> 15:51.206
Oh, yes! Crepes! What are crepes?

15:53.427 --> 15:55.427
Yep, so that's the crib.

15:55.466 --> 15:58.423
If my parents had a place like
this I'd still be living at home.

15:58.448 --> 16:00.787
Right. You see? It's
not tragic. It's not.

16:00.826 --> 16:03.187
So I was thinking, male
changing in the kitchen.

16:03.217 --> 16:04.903
- Uh-huh.
- Female changing out here,

16:04.927 --> 16:06.168
- where we can see them.
- Yes.

16:06.193 --> 16:07.907
Make sure they don't steal anything.

16:07.947 --> 16:10.072
Some of the girls from
the office are nasty.

16:10.097 --> 16:13.470
So this is the foot-wash thing
we use before the main pool,

16:13.495 --> 16:16.346
- which is... where?
- No. No, this is the pool.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.106
- This is the pool?
- Yeah.

16:19.147 --> 16:22.586
We can't party in this!
It's 'one in, one out'.

16:22.626 --> 16:25.244
I was planning on heavy
petting and breast stroke puns.

16:25.269 --> 16:28.586
- This is way too small!
- No, the smaller the pool the better.

16:28.626 --> 16:31.427
Then the girls can't escape.
We'll be big fish in a small pond.

16:31.452 --> 16:33.786
- Er, what's that now?
- Oh, it's my ducky float.

16:33.817 --> 16:35.302
I'm not allowed in the pool without him.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.395
And you're expecting to
pull with that on, are you?

16:37.421 --> 16:39.894
Er, just a bit, yeah.
Chicks dig the duck, dude.

16:39.919 --> 16:43.506
I'm gonna get the hunnies
poolside and just... get quacking.

16:43.547 --> 16:46.947
Quack-quack! Yeah.

16:48.373 --> 16:50.226
Aagh, gone a bit too far.

16:50.267 --> 16:53.386
Just wind it back a bit.
Not looking, not looking.

16:53.427 --> 16:55.826
Right. Here we go, chapter five.

16:55.866 --> 16:58.106
- At last.
- Mm.

16:58.481 --> 17:01.081
"Meanwhile, Aeneas and his fleet..."

17:03.547 --> 17:06.169
- Huh.
- Hey, you're here!

17:06.193 --> 17:08.044
Thanks so much for this, guys.

17:08.068 --> 17:09.717
No problem. What for?

17:09.741 --> 17:12.622
I said Maya could stay
while there's this heat-wave.

17:12.646 --> 17:15.047
The squat's really
unhygienic at the moment.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.916
- You were right, Marcus.
- Was I?

17:17.106 --> 17:19.747
It's probably fine. I'm
sure I was overreacting.

17:19.787 --> 17:23.826
We don't need a walk-in
wardrobe or panic room, so...

17:23.866 --> 17:27.866
Yeah. I guess this way
every room's a panic room.

17:34.541 --> 17:36.981
I mean, how the bloody
hell do you cook eggs?

17:37.007 --> 17:38.528
How do you make them flat?

17:38.554 --> 17:40.953
Just nibble at whatever's
in the pantry. I would.

17:41.112 --> 17:43.240
- That's what we did.
- Well, I need a proper meal.

17:43.265 --> 17:44.866
Alba, how's my chicken coming on?

17:44.906 --> 17:46.358
Oh, think he's fine.

17:46.384 --> 17:49.838
What's he doing? Get
in that oven at once!

17:50.250 --> 17:52.893
Why is no-one doing what I say?

17:52.917 --> 17:56.002
I'm the bloody master of this house!

17:56.028 --> 17:59.626
And I demand that you
dirty shirkers get up

17:59.666 --> 18:01.826
and get back to work now!

18:01.866 --> 18:03.747
Four against one, though, innit?

18:03.795 --> 18:05.270
Five if you count the chicken.

18:05.295 --> 18:07.481
You're gonna pay for what
you've done here, Grumio.

18:07.507 --> 18:10.068
I'm gonna have your
balls in a bloody bun!

18:15.747 --> 18:19.186
I don't understand. I put the
address and a map on the invite.

18:19.211 --> 18:21.923
And at least ten girls from the
office said to put it down as a maybe.

18:21.948 --> 18:23.093
What?!

18:23.094 --> 18:26.334
- "Maybe" means no!
- What? No, "maybe" means maybe.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.693
They might just be fashionably late.

18:29.694 --> 18:31.666
Or they might be fashionably not coming.

18:31.707 --> 18:35.027
Because you're a massive loser
who still lives with his parents,

18:35.067 --> 18:38.409
has got shit hair and can't
even swim in a big bathtub

18:38.433 --> 18:39.913
without a twatish duck!

18:41.246 --> 18:42.382
I can swim!

18:55.027 --> 18:56.876
Aurelius?

18:56.902 --> 18:58.641
Oh, shit! Hey!

19:03.547 --> 19:04.881
Aurelius!

19:09.227 --> 19:10.946
- That's the end of the wine.
- Cool.

19:10.987 --> 19:13.659
Well, do let me know if
there's anything else you want.

19:13.683 --> 19:16.507
- One of my kidneys maybe.
- Can you get me some olive oil?

19:16.547 --> 19:20.067
- I said I'd give Delph a massage.
- Mm, yeah, that'd be amazing.

19:20.106 --> 19:23.423
Er, yeah, but what do I
do? While you're doing this.

19:23.449 --> 19:25.946
Whatever. Go to bed if you want.

19:25.987 --> 19:28.116
Well, nah.

19:28.142 --> 19:29.557
I don't wanna just leave you on your own,

19:29.583 --> 19:32.082
just a sort of de facto... host.

19:32.106 --> 19:33.588
Or maybe...

19:36.317 --> 19:39.077
Oh. OK. That's... Erm...

19:39.103 --> 19:42.423
Isn't this what you
call a "good" threesome?

19:43.670 --> 19:45.467
Whoo!

19:45.507 --> 19:48.009
I know we're only throwing
eggs at a bin but...

19:48.034 --> 19:50.323
for the first time in my life
I feel like I'm actually free.

19:50.347 --> 19:52.127
Hear, hear. And it's
all thanks to Grumio.

19:52.153 --> 19:55.711
Your free-thinking and downright
daring approach to servitude

19:55.737 --> 19:58.027
has empowered all of
us to follow our hearts.

19:58.067 --> 20:00.067
And workwise, it is a lot easier.

20:05.192 --> 20:07.952
I understand that one of
the slaves in this house

20:07.978 --> 20:10.301
has led a rebellion against the master.

20:10.326 --> 20:12.211
Which one of you lot is Grumio?

20:14.346 --> 20:16.375
I am Grumio.

20:17.744 --> 20:19.825
I am Grumio.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.220
I am Grumio.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.866
I am Groovio.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.646
Am I saying that right?

20:45.965 --> 20:47.876
Yeah, I'll leave you to it.

20:53.027 --> 20:57.227
Yeah! Now, just let this
be a lesson to you all.

21:00.145 --> 21:03.190
Oh, bloody hell, they've
crucified the wrong one!

21:03.214 --> 21:06.586
- I mean, come on...
- I'm sorry, sir.

21:06.626 --> 21:09.463
Just... The rest of you,
just get back to work

21:09.489 --> 21:11.364
before you bloody join him!

21:12.115 --> 21:13.479
Not you!

21:13.503 --> 21:15.519
You... follow me.

21:17.989 --> 21:19.394
Best of luck, then.

21:20.114 --> 21:22.086
Best of luck? What the...

21:22.769 --> 21:24.978
I take back everything
I said earlier, Grumio.

21:25.001 --> 21:26.506
I wish I'd never listened to you.

21:26.507 --> 21:29.146
You're a lazy idiot and
this is all your fault!

21:29.680 --> 21:31.246
Should've let me have that carrot.

21:34.699 --> 21:35.942
What...

21:39.414 --> 21:41.414
Urgh, the little beard!

21:48.426 --> 21:51.826
- Aurelius?
- Er, Mummy, Daddy.

21:51.866 --> 21:54.626
It's not what it looks like.
He made me take my ducky off.

22:00.815 --> 22:03.423
Oh, what are you doing?

22:03.788 --> 22:05.827
That's our thing we do together.

22:05.946 --> 22:07.946
Yeah. Likewise.

22:11.186 --> 22:12.626
I'll get that, shall I?

22:13.315 --> 22:14.875
Thought so.

22:15.714 --> 22:17.643
And can you get us some water?

22:18.282 --> 22:19.453
Oh.

22:21.146 --> 22:23.027
Take him back, please?

22:23.074 --> 22:25.423
This man is the worst slave in the world.

22:26.349 --> 22:29.298
No such thing as a bad
slave. Just a bad master.

22:31.386 --> 22:33.586
To be honest, I'm impressed
you lasted 48 hours.

22:33.626 --> 22:35.363
Dunno what his problem was.
