00:02.270 --> 00:04.363
*

00:05.200 --> 00:06.599
You wanted to see me?

00:06.640 --> 00:08.596
Shut the door, would you?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.331
Have a seat.

00:13.380 --> 00:14.506
(sighs)

00:15.780 --> 00:18.101
My sister is
a big reader.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.118
She's always got
a book in her hands.

00:20.150 --> 00:22.186
Most of it's crap--
the kind of books, you know,

00:22.220 --> 00:24.245
you buy at the airport
and leave on the plane.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.212
Aanay...
for the last

00:26.260 --> 00:28.216
couple of months,
she has been hounding me

00:28.260 --> 00:29.488
to read this.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.486
The Heart Bled Blue.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.623
You ever heard of it?
No.

00:33.660 --> 00:36.220
Does the author's name
ring a bell?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.623
No. Why?

00:37.670 --> 00:40.161
Because it's about
two detectives.

00:40.200 --> 00:43.135
_ One is a beautiful
Chinese-American woman.

00:43.170 --> 00:46.105
The other, her partner,
is a guy from London.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.539
You're kidding.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.172
They live together.

00:49.210 --> 00:51.144
They consult for the NYPD.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.444
Their names aren't
Holmes and Watson,

00:53.480 --> 00:55.175
but still.

00:55.220 --> 00:57.484
You may not know Grover Ogden,

00:57.520 --> 01:00.182
but he seems to know
a lot about you.

01:02.290 --> 01:05.259
(chain saws buzzing)

01:07.260 --> 01:09.262
(saw rewing, buzzing)

01:15.740 --> 01:18.800
I'm not paying your guys
to sit around, Vince.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.239
What's the holdup?

01:20.280 --> 01:21.633
Couldn't get the chipper
going when we got here.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.669
I think it's jammed.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.272
It was fine yesterday.

01:25.310 --> 01:27.141
VINCE:
Repair guy's on his way.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.317
How long are we talking?

01:28.350 --> 01:30.113
Um, hour.

01:30.150 --> 01:31.378
Maybe two?

01:31.420 --> 01:33.183
I got ten more plots to clear

01:33.220 --> 01:34.881
before I can
stop pouring foundations.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.626
Where's the jam?

01:36.660 --> 01:39.151
Probably somewhere between
the drum and the cutter knives.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.451
(grunts)

01:47.800 --> 01:48.789
I got it!

01:50.270 --> 01:51.430
Start it up.

01:53.810 --> 01:55.903
(engine starting)
Whoa! Shut it down!

01:55.940 --> 01:56.907
Right now!

01:56.950 --> 01:59.373
What now?
Look.

02:09.860 --> 02:12.351
*

02:17.400 --> 02:20.198
GREGSON: Believe it or not,
this used to be an FBI agent.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.538
Or, at least, that's
what the badge says.

02:22.570 --> 02:25.937
Lab is running the DNA
to make sure.

02:25.970 --> 02:28.279
Special Agent
Robert Underhill, retired.

02:28.310 --> 02:30.449
His car was found about
200 yards from the scene.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.311
GREGSON: I reached out to
the Bureau's New York office;

02:32.350 --> 02:33.612
they're standing by
to help, but...

02:33.650 --> 02:37.279
since Underhill was officially
a civilian,

02:37.320 --> 02:39.356
it's our case.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.379
No Joan today?

02:40.420 --> 02:42.320
She's going to join us later.

02:42.360 --> 02:45.227
So what else do we know about
Special Agent Underhill?

02:45.260 --> 02:47.455
An exemplary
34-year career,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.559
well-liked by
his colleagues.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.967
He and his wife Sheila
moved to Kauai, 2012.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.389
They moved back to New York
about seven months ago.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.432
Well, assuming this is
Special Agent Underhill,

02:58.470 --> 03:00.609
he would've been dead before
he went into the wood chipper.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.346
The killer would've had to
dismember him

03:02.380 --> 03:04.507
in order to get him
through the infeed chute.

03:04.550 --> 03:05.949
Right, so CSU examined
all the chain saws

03:05.980 --> 03:07.709
that were used at the site,

03:07.750 --> 03:10.287
and found one with some
blood between the teeth.
(sniffing)

03:10.320 --> 03:12.982
They think someone used it and
then cleaned it last night.

03:13.020 --> 03:14.556
Oleoresin capsicum.

03:14.590 --> 03:17.229
More commonly known
as... (sniffs) pepper spray.

03:17.260 --> 03:18.522
We should alert the
M.E. that this bag

03:18.560 --> 03:21.620
contains at least part
of the face.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.265
I'm sure he'll appreciate that.
So the bootprint

03:24.300 --> 03:27.497
found next to his car suggests
he drove there himself.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.338
Pepper spray,
it's a close-range weapon.

03:30.370 --> 03:33.476
Whoever deployed it would have
had to have been close to him.

03:33.510 --> 03:36.570
You think he was invited
to the scene, knew his attacker.

03:36.610 --> 03:39.340
The agent was a large man--
at least 220 pounds.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.371
So if I was going to turn him
into pulp,

03:41.420 --> 03:43.911
I'd want him as close to
that wood chipper as possible.

03:43.950 --> 03:45.747
You said his wife's
name was Sheila?

03:45.790 --> 03:47.382
Mm.

03:47.420 --> 03:48.978
We should talk to her,
see if she knows her way

03:49.020 --> 03:50.453
around a chain saw.

03:50.490 --> 03:52.822
What makes you think
she did this?

03:52.860 --> 03:55.420
Well, his personal effects
are here. I see the remains

03:55.460 --> 03:57.428
of a wallet, watch...

03:57.470 --> 03:59.267
there's no wedding ring.

03:59.300 --> 04:01.860
And this bag,
amongst the skin and bones,

04:01.900 --> 04:05.438
has flecks of
latex and foil.

04:05.470 --> 04:06.630
Looks like he was carrying

04:06.680 --> 04:09.399
at least one wrapped condom
with him.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.907
So he may not have been ready
for a fight, but...

04:11.950 --> 04:14.441
he was ready for fun.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.641
Bob wasn't
cheating on me.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.988
At least, not
with another woman.

04:19.020 --> 04:20.453
The only affair

04:20.490 --> 04:22.685
he ever had was with his job.

04:22.730 --> 04:26.848
It was our understanding
your husband retired in 2012.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.368
He did. We sold our house
and moved to Kauai.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.789
Then he got restless.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.798
Missed his work,
missed the city.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.003
I could tell he wasn't happy,
so I agreed to move back.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.928
HOLMES:
Respectfully,

04:38.970 --> 04:40.938
Mrs. Underhill,
we found evidence

04:40.980 --> 04:43.346
that he may have still been
restless:

04:43.380 --> 04:46.372
the remains _
of two unused prophylactlcs.

04:46.420 --> 04:48.809
We separated six months ago.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.715
It was amicable.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.456
We stayed in touch.

04:52.490 --> 04:54.856
So you separated
but didn't divorce.

04:54.890 --> 04:57.723
I'm guessing that means you're
still his primary beneficiary.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.729
You'd have been entitled to his
pensnon, his life Insurance...

05:00.760 --> 05:04.469
I had dinner at my daughter's
house in New Jersey last night.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.434
Drank half a bottle of ros,

05:06.470 --> 05:09.507
spent the night
in the guest room.
Can anyone

05:09.540 --> 05:10.939
other than your daughter
confirm that?

05:10.970 --> 05:13.700
I took a train back to
the city this morning.

05:13.740 --> 05:17.403
There should be a record
of my ticket purchase and...

05:17.450 --> 05:19.645
security footage
from stations.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.716
All right,
we'll look into it.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.718
In the meantime,
can you think of anyone

05:23.750 --> 05:25.718
who would've wanted
to hurt your husband?

05:25.750 --> 05:28.116
After we moved back to New York,

05:28.160 --> 05:30.720
Bob started looking into some
of his old cases.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.955
Ones that he never solved.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.367
He asked a friend at the Bureau
for copies of a bunch of files.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.129
The last time
we spoke,

05:38.170 --> 05:40.388
he said he thought one
of those cases

05:40.440 --> 05:42.738
was finally going to crack.
He was closing in

05:42.770 --> 05:44.965
on someone.
VVho?

05:45.010 --> 05:46.602
I don't know.

05:46.640 --> 05:49.438
Out of respect,
he kept shop talk to a minimum

05:49.480 --> 05:51.846
after we separated.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.848
But I'm sure if you go
to his apartment,

05:53.880 --> 05:56.519
you'll find all the files.

05:56.550 --> 06:00.850
They may tell you
everything you need to know.

06:00.890 --> 06:01.879
(knocking on door)

06:06.090 --> 06:07.057
Joanie.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.522
My gosh.

06:08.560 --> 06:10.425
It's been months.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.438
You look beautiful.

06:12.470 --> 06:13.539
Thanks, Dad.

06:13.570 --> 06:17.006
Or should I call you
Grover Ogden?

06:17.040 --> 06:18.735
What were you thinking?

06:18.770 --> 06:21.000
I was honoring you.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.076
The choices you make,
the work you do.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.078
I think it's wonderful.
Really?

06:25.110 --> 06:27.476
So that's why you didn't ask
my permission.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.839
That's why you
used a pseudonym.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.939
Because you knew
how honored I would be.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.480
Did you even read the book?

06:32.520 --> 06:33.612
Of course I read the book.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.082
And?
It's ridiculous.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.623
Sherlock and I do not run around
with guns

06:37.660 --> 06:39.525
and we don't get into
kung fu fights with criminals

06:39.560 --> 06:41.892
and we sure as hell
do not sleep together.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.864
Well, sex sells, Joanie.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.561
You know that.

06:45.600 --> 06:46.965
So how did you know
that that was me?

06:47.000 --> 06:48.536
Grover Ogden?
We lived on Ogden Avenue.

06:48.570 --> 06:49.639
Grover was our dog.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.864
And by the way,
that is

06:50.910 --> 06:52.104
how you make a porn name,

06:52.140 --> 06:53.869
not a pen name!

06:53.910 --> 06:56.606
Okay, look,
I owed my publishers a book.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.606
I was blocked. I've never
been blocked like this before.

06:58.650 --> 06:59.912
I was going crazy.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.144
So your mother comes home
from seeing you

07:01.180 --> 07:02.647
in the city,
and she tells me

07:02.690 --> 07:03.839
about this_case
you're working on,

07:03.890 --> 07:05.585
so...
Did she know about this?

07:05.620 --> 07:07.508
No. I'm just telling you
how it all happened.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.654
I don't care how it happened.
I just want it to go away.

07:10.690 --> 07:12.521
Well, what does that mean?

07:12.560 --> 07:14.949
The Heart Bled Blue
didn't get the e-book treatment,

07:15.000 --> 07:16.797
which is good, for both of us,
because I spent

07:16.830 --> 07:18.525
almost $4,000
last night

07:18.570 --> 07:21.539
trying to find all the
hard copies I could find online.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.037
You're gonna contact
your publisher

07:23.070 --> 07:24.560
and you're gonna track down
the rest.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.032
(chuckling):
You can't be serious.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.973
Did Sherlock read the book?

07:30.010 --> 07:32.547
What does that have to do
with anything?
Well, you gave

07:32.580 --> 07:33.877
your opinion.
I'd like to know his.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.480
Okay, first,
you are not friends.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.557
You met him once,
at Aunt Vivian's funeral.

07:39.590 --> 07:41.888
Second, he is never
gonna find out about this.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.753
He is the most private person
that I know. He would freak

07:44.790 --> 07:46.496
if he found out.

07:46.530 --> 07:48.657
Call your publisher, Dad.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.861
I mean it.

08:11.620 --> 08:12.951
HOLMES:
Typically, I'm averse

08:12.990 --> 08:14.685
to color coordination,
but I dare say

08:14.720 --> 08:16.017
it brightens the place up.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.051
What is all this?

08:18.090 --> 08:19.955
The case files
of the late Bob Underhill.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.297
You got my texts?

08:21.330 --> 08:23.764
Murdered FBI agent
fed through a wood chipper.

08:23.800 --> 08:24.824
His wife thought
it was over

08:24.870 --> 08:25.928
one of his unsolved cases.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.062
Marcus and I

08:27.100 --> 08:28.863
went to his apartment
and discovered

08:28.900 --> 08:30.868
he had been revisiting three
of them.

08:30.910 --> 08:34.129
I made copies of his files and
assigned each case its own room.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.533
As you can see,

08:35.580 --> 08:36.979
the library
tells the tale

08:37.010 --> 08:38.170
of a hate crime,

08:38.210 --> 08:40.110
a church burnt to the ground
in 1981.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.549
The arsonist,

08:41.580 --> 08:42.945
never identified.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.116
You think
that's who killed Underhill?

08:44.150 --> 08:45.287
I do not.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.856
Thanks in no small part

08:47.890 --> 08:49.050
to the late agent's
meticulous notes,

08:49.090 --> 08:50.887
I identified the guilty party.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.898
He died in 1982.

08:52.930 --> 08:56.718
This case took longer
to solve, but not much.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.989
Two-man bank robbery from 1997.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.907
As it turns out,
both parties went to jail

09:02.940 --> 09:04.862
f_or unrelated crimes
In the early aughts.

09:04.910 --> 09:06.878
Both parties
remain incarcerated,

09:06.910 --> 09:08.229
so they're not
our killers either.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.875
Finally, the case
of a serial poisoner

09:11.910 --> 09:14.947
who took six lives
between 2008 and 2012.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.982
I realized that
the culprit was, in fact,

09:17.020 --> 09:19.147
the brother of one of
Underhill's original suspects.

09:19.190 --> 09:21.112
The only problem,
he's in the Navy and he was

09:21.160 --> 09:23.287
_ on an aircraft carrier_
In the Arabian Sea last night.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.218
So you took

09:25.260 --> 09:27.057
the three cases this guy
couldn't crack

09:27.100 --> 09:28.897
over an entire career

09:28.930 --> 09:30.727
and you solved them
in a few hours.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.260
Bad news is

09:32.300 --> 09:34.097
his wife was wrong.
Underhill's old cases

09:34.140 --> 09:35.767
had nothing to do
with his murder.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.904
Actually,
I think one of them did.

09:37.940 --> 09:39.669
I asked the captain

09:39.710 --> 09:42.178
to find out if Underhill had
requested any other case files,

09:42.210 --> 09:44.804
and it turns out he had.

09:45.810 --> 09:47.277
Mina Davenport.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.015
Oh, you're familiar
with the case?
Of course.

09:49.050 --> 09:51.245
She was kidnapped
in 2004.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.087
The guy who took her
kept her in a basement.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.759
Ten years later, she escaped and
came home-- it was a huge story.

09:55.790 --> 09:58.179
Are you saying that Underhill
worked her abduction in '04?

09:58.230 --> 10:00.790
He did. And again in 2015.

10:00.830 --> 10:03.128
He asked for and received copies
of her case file

10:03.170 --> 10:04.762
just a few months ago.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.768
Curious, then,
that they were not amongst

10:06.800 --> 10:08.688
his many other materials.

10:08.740 --> 10:10.139
Well, Mina's kidnapper
was never found.

10:10.170 --> 10:12.775
You think that's who
Underhill was closing in on?

10:12.810 --> 10:14.277
I think the absence of the files
the agent requested

10:14.310 --> 10:16.130
is very suspicious.

10:16.180 --> 10:19.308
Perhaps the killer removed them
from his person last night.

10:19.350 --> 10:20.772
Perhaps, post-mulching,

10:20.820 --> 10:22.788
he used his keys
to access his apartment.

10:22.820 --> 10:24.788
Either way, it could mean

10:24.820 --> 10:26.788
that Mina's abductor committed
a murder

10:26.820 --> 10:30.187
less than 20 miles
from her home last night.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.660
WOMAN:
It's hard to explain,

10:35.700 --> 10:37.827
losing your only child
when she's ten,

10:37.870 --> 10:41.237
and then getting
her back at 20.

10:41.270 --> 10:44.831
People tend to think about
the ten years you lost,

10:44.870 --> 10:48.169
but we could only think
about the future;

10:48.210 --> 10:50.246
all the time we were gonna
have together after all.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.310
It was a gift.

10:54.350 --> 10:56.818
But we knew there
was a catch,

10:56.850 --> 10:58.989
that the monster
who had taken Mina

10:59.020 --> 11:00.055
was still out there.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.318
BELL:
Like I said,

11:01.360 --> 11:02.725
we can't be sure he's the one

11:02.760 --> 11:04.159
who killed Bob Underhill.

11:04.190 --> 11:05.919
We wanted to know
if you've seen anything

11:05.960 --> 11:07.154
out of the ordinary lately,

11:07.200 --> 11:09.760
any strange faces
or vehicles?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.062
No.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.294
Nothing.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.230
What about Mina?

11:14.270 --> 11:15.828
If she had,
she would've told us.

11:15.870 --> 11:17.235
Is she here?

11:17.270 --> 11:19.306
She's upstairs
with her tutor.

11:19.340 --> 11:20.375
She's working on her GED.

11:20.410 --> 11:21.809
I mean, if it's
all the same to you,

11:21.840 --> 11:23.273
I'd rather not
bring her into this.

11:23.310 --> 11:25.801
If we're right, Mr. Davenport,

11:25.850 --> 11:28.011
she may be at
the very center of it.

11:28.050 --> 11:29.244
RICHARD:
Well, if you're right.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.817
If you're not,
you could just upset her.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.750
You could set her
back months.

11:33.790 --> 11:35.951
We've worked so hard
to make her feel safe;

11:35.990 --> 11:37.355
to help her
find some peace.

11:37.390 --> 11:39.858
After she first
got away,

11:39.900 --> 11:42.152
she wouldn't let
anyone touch her,

11:42.200 --> 11:43.394
not for weeks.

11:43.430 --> 11:45.967
Now she'll let me
hold her hand again.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.935
She'll...
let me hug her.

11:48.970 --> 11:50.801
What about Bob Underhill?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.205
Had you heard from him lately?

11:52.240 --> 11:53.275
(sighs)

11:53.310 --> 11:54.504
I wish we had.

11:54.540 --> 11:56.007
Uh...

11:58.010 --> 11:59.841
Look, a... a-after
this happened,

11:59.880 --> 12:01.177
I-I, um...

12:01.220 --> 12:03.518
I-I could hardly function.

12:03.550 --> 12:05.381
I was the one
who was supposed

12:05.420 --> 12:07.251
to pick Mina up
from school that day;

12:07.290 --> 12:09.417
H was the one who let
the meeting run long, I...

12:09.460 --> 12:13.396
I mean, it was my fault
that she tried to walk
home and, um...

12:13.430 --> 12:14.795
(sighs)

12:14.830 --> 12:17.264
...when I could do nothing,

12:17.300 --> 12:20.064
Agent Underhill
did everything.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.533
He was, uh...

12:21.570 --> 12:23.367
he was our rock.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.799
HOLMES:
We knew that Mina
was able to help

12:25.840 --> 12:28.274
the FBI generate a sketch
of her captor.

12:28.310 --> 12:31.199
She even, uh, provided
a first name: Keith.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.878
In the months
smce her return,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.241
has she remembered any other
salient details?

12:36.280 --> 12:37.417
Anything that might help us

12:37.450 --> 12:38.883
identify him?

12:38.920 --> 12:40.558
I'm sorry. No.

12:40.590 --> 12:43.024
MINA:
Mom... Dad...

12:45.160 --> 12:46.821
Is everything okay?

12:46.860 --> 12:48.418
It's all right, sweetie.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.223
We'll be done in here

12:50.270 --> 12:51.464
in just a minute.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.362
BELL:
Davenports may not have
seen Keith around,

12:58.410 --> 13:01.379
but that doesn't mean
we can't circulate his sketch.

13:01.410 --> 13:03.048
WATSON: Even if he didn't
kill Underhill,

13:03.080 --> 13:04.843
he's still
worth finding.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.212
Assuming a figment of someone's
imagination can be found.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.478
What is that
supposed to mean?

13:08.520 --> 13:09.509
That man

13:09.550 --> 13:11.313
did not kill
Agent Underhill,

13:11.350 --> 13:13.409
nor did he kidnap
that young woman.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.348
The description she gave
is entirely fictional.

13:15.390 --> 13:17.324
Hold up-- are you calling
Mina Davenport a liar?

13:17.360 --> 13:20.022
No, I'm calling
that young girl a liar.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.994
She's not Mina Davenport.

13:22.030 --> 13:23.520
She's an imposter.

13:27.500 --> 13:31.334
HOLMES:
The old proverb says the eyes
are the window to the soul.

13:31.370 --> 13:34.339
In this case, it's the ears.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.471
Note, in each image,

13:37.510 --> 13:39.000
the depth of
the triangular fossa

13:39.050 --> 13:42.474
and the degree of attachment
of the lobule.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.216
These are the ears
of two different people.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.389
They don't look
that different to me.

13:47.420 --> 13:48.853
Watson?

13:48.890 --> 13:50.084
He's right.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.428
The architecture
of the second ear is all wrong.

13:52.460 --> 13:54.621
Mina Davenport disappeared
when she was ten years old.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.890
She grew; she changed.
Her body changed.

13:56.930 --> 13:58.227
But not her ears.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.589
They grow as kids get older,

13:59.630 --> 14:00.938
but they don't change shape.

14:00.970 --> 14:03.063
Basically, this girl

14:03.110 --> 14:05.408
could not have grown up
to become this girl.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.499
We no longer think
that Agent Underhill

14:07.540 --> 14:10.270
was onto Mina Davenport's
abductor.

14:10.310 --> 14:12.403
We believe he was
onto her Imposter.

14:12.450 --> 14:13.542
Because of ears.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.275
Six months ago,

14:15.320 --> 14:17.015
the first pictures
of Miracle Mina

14:17.050 --> 14:19.587
were released by her family
to the press.

14:19.620 --> 14:21.451
Two weeks later,
Agent Underhill

14:21.490 --> 14:23.287
requested copies
of any and all files

14:23.330 --> 14:26.026
pertaining to her
disappearance in 2004.

14:26.060 --> 14:28.528
Now, perhaps he noticed
the same discrepancy I did.

14:28.560 --> 14:29.959
Perhaps it was something else.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.628
Either way, I believe
that he suspected

14:32.670 --> 14:34.467
this girl had
taken the place

14:34.500 --> 14:36.331
of the real Mina.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.509
Presumably to avail herself
of the Davenports'

14:38.540 --> 14:40.201
vast wealth.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.502
The girl
you're saying isn't Mina,

14:41.540 --> 14:43.349
she passed a DNA test.

14:43.380 --> 14:45.598
Tell me that wasn't
in Underhill's files?

14:45.650 --> 14:46.639
It was.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.648
Her DNA was a perfect match

14:48.680 --> 14:51.615
for the sample taken
from Mina's toothbrush in 2004.

14:51.650 --> 14:54.050
Funny thing about
that toothbrush.

14:54.090 --> 14:56.012
It disappeared around
the same time as the test.

14:56.060 --> 14:58.654
The private lab which
compared the two samples

14:58.690 --> 15:00.590
chalked it up to human error.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.029
We think the imposter
had an accomplice,

15:02.060 --> 15:03.527
someone inside the lab

15:03.570 --> 15:05.697
who made sure to test her DNA
agaInst Itself

15:05.730 --> 15:07.231
and then got rid
of the toothbrush

15:07.270 --> 15:09.534
to prevent
future tests.

15:09.570 --> 15:10.969
Frankly, Captain, I'm surprised

15:11.010 --> 15:12.978
you don't find our thesis
more compelling.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.637
I find it
compelling as hell,

15:14.680 --> 15:17.148
but I also think I'm
the only parent in the room.

15:17.180 --> 15:18.579
You know your kids.

15:18.610 --> 15:20.111
I don't care if they're gone

15:20.150 --> 15:21.674
ten years or 50.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.415
You know them.

15:23.450 --> 15:25.589
How many of your children
have been kidnapped?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.308
I'm merely pointing out

15:28.360 --> 15:30.681
that these parents
could hardly be blamed

15:30.730 --> 15:32.618
for falling prey to a charlatan.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.457
They dreamt of their
daughter's safe return

15:34.500 --> 15:35.728
for over a decade.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.227
We want to
invite them in,

15:37.270 --> 15:39.295
break the news to _them
as gently as pOSSIble.

15:39.330 --> 15:42.231
All they have to do is let us
take a DNA sample from them,

15:42.270 --> 15:43.430
and then we can
compare that

15:43.470 --> 15:44.630
to the samples taken

15:44.670 --> 15:46.661
from the imposter in 2014.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.007
Those, the lab does still have.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.268
They'll prove that she isn't

15:49.310 --> 15:51.449
who she says she is.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.674
At the very least,
Captain,

15:52.710 --> 15:54.246
the Davenports
deserve to know

15:54.280 --> 15:56.612
whether they have a killer
living under their roof.

16:02.520 --> 16:04.522
Mr. Davenport...
thanks for coming.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.754
Yeah.
Of course.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.018
You said
you had news.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.698
We do, but...

16:08.730 --> 16:10.698
we thought your wife
was joining.
Yeah.

16:10.730 --> 16:13.369
She's just right there.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.561
Oh, you brought Mina.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.999
Yeah, well, after
you left last night,

16:17.040 --> 16:18.200
she just kept asking
questions about you

16:18.240 --> 16:19.662
and... she knows
something's up,

16:19.710 --> 16:21.405
so Nancy and I...

16:21.440 --> 16:22.634
well, we told her the truth.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.547
She was... very brave.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.775
She, uh, said she
wanted to know everything.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.617
Mina...

16:29.650 --> 16:31.413
this is
Detective Bell.

16:31.450 --> 16:34.351
This is Ms. Watson
and Mr. Holmes.

16:34.390 --> 16:35.709
Actually, Mina,

16:35.760 --> 16:36.658
we were hoping to talk

16:36.690 --> 16:38.123
to your parents alone.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.754
Oh.
Whatever you have to say,

16:40.800 --> 16:42.256
I can hear it.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.127
I never met Agent Underhill,

16:45.170 --> 16:47.695
but I know how much he did
for my mom and dad.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.504
I want to help.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.477
MINA:
It was my birthday that week.

16:56.510 --> 16:59.104
Not my real birthday;
the one he'd given me.

16:59.150 --> 17:00.708
Keith.

17:00.750 --> 17:04.516
It was the one time of year
he was actually nice to me.

17:04.550 --> 17:06.609
It wasn't until later
that I realized

17:06.650 --> 17:09.312
it was the anniversary
of the day he took me.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.551
We had just gotten back
from a trip.

17:14.730 --> 17:18.826
So this Keith-- he was,
uh, he was a trucker and, uh,

17:18.870 --> 17:22.397
he kept you stashed
in the back of his, uh, cab

17:22.440 --> 17:24.635
during long hauls.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.729
I wasn't allowed
to leave the truck, but...

17:26.770 --> 17:29.705
I could look
out the window sometimes.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.709
I could see trees, cars...

17:32.750 --> 17:35.344
other people.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.847
When I was
in the basement,

17:36.880 --> 17:39.087
_ it was...
It was just me.

17:40.390 --> 17:42.085
So, um, according to this file,

17:42.120 --> 17:43.724
uh, you-you never
had any inkling,

17:45.860 --> 17:48.693
Keith's home was in.

17:48.730 --> 17:51.426
Well, I was so young
when he took me and I wasn't...

17:51.470 --> 17:53.665
I wasn't allowed to watch any TV

17:53.700 --> 17:56.362
or look at a newspaper, ever.
The FBI people

17:56.400 --> 17:58.709
said that was because
he needed me to be

17:58.740 --> 18:01.231
completely dependent on him.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.271
It worked.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.749
So you were saying it was

18:05.780 --> 18:08.146
the-the week of
your birthday...

18:09.280 --> 18:11.646
Keith said it was time.

18:11.690 --> 18:14.113
We started thinking
about having a family.

18:15.820 --> 18:18.186
And I, and I couldn't
stop thinking about that.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.127
We were on the road.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.195
Another trip.

18:22.230 --> 18:25.791
I... waited
until he fell asleep,

18:25.830 --> 18:28.867
and then...
I went into his bag.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.762
And I took out the
straight razor he used to shave

18:32.810 --> 18:35.608
and I held it
right up to his neck.

18:35.640 --> 18:37.198
But you didn't do it.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.706
I don't know why,

18:38.750 --> 18:40.615
I just couldn't.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.141
I got out of the truck
and I just ran

18:43.190 --> 18:45.146
and I didn't stop running
until that morning.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.784
HOLMES:
And you were in, uh,

18:47.820 --> 18:49.685
Lander, Pennsylvania.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.780
I didn't know it
at the time, but yes.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.855
So then you, um,
you shut yourself

18:54.900 --> 18:57.619
into a gas station restroom

18:57.670 --> 18:59.820
and you take out Keith's

18:59.870 --> 19:02.691
straight razor
and you cut off all your hair.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.231
Keith forced me
to dye my hair blonde.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.431
He had, ever since I was ten.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.574
My therapist
said I was reclaiming

19:10.610 --> 19:12.373
my old self, but...
(indistinct talking)

19:12.410 --> 19:14.219
to be honest...

19:14.250 --> 19:16.616
I don't even remember doing it.

19:18.620 --> 19:20.611
I couldn't even tell you
what I was thinking.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.288
Well, what you were thinking
is that you wanted to look

19:23.330 --> 19:26.754
as pathetic as possible
when-when the police found you.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.189
Yeah.
I...

19:28.230 --> 19:30.221
You are one of
the best liars

19:30.270 --> 19:33.728
I have ever met, and
that's saying something.

19:33.770 --> 19:35.931
It's small wonder you've managed
to fool the Davenports.
RICHARD: No, look, I'm sorry.

19:35.970 --> 19:38.837
What?
I mean, they're still
defending you right now.

19:38.870 --> 19:40.599
GREGSON: Mr. Davenport...
They still believe
you're their daughter,

19:40.640 --> 19:41.937
(Richard speaking angrily)
...but we, of course,

19:41.980 --> 19:43.607
we know you are not.

19:44.610 --> 19:46.248
Mina, we're leaving.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.349
Dad-Daddy, what's going on?
Come on. Right now.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.972
It's okay, sweetie,
you haven't done anything wrong.

19:49.020 --> 19:50.749
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.781
Stay the hell away
from my family!

20:02.930 --> 20:05.819
Smells like something
died in here.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.759
I'd hardly expect elephant dung
to smell like potpourri.

20:08.800 --> 20:09.994
It is, in fact,
a highly

20:10.040 --> 20:11.928
sought-after coffee,

20:11.970 --> 20:13.972
produced by feeding
arabica beans to pachyderms

20:14.010 --> 20:15.375
in northern Thailand.

20:15.410 --> 20:17.970
And it has the potential
to further reduce

20:18.010 --> 20:20.001
my need for sleep.
Would you...?

20:20.050 --> 20:22.245
No, thanks.
I had poop for lunch.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.989
You should've seen
the Davenports' faces when

20:25.020 --> 20:26.942
we broke the news to them.
I mean, I knew they'd

20:26.990 --> 20:28.355
take it hard, but I didn't think

20:28.390 --> 20:30.017
they'd refuse
to give us their DNA.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.949
We underestimated the hold
the imposter has over them.

20:32.990 --> 20:35.299
If they won't help
prove she's a fraud,

20:35.330 --> 20:37.321
we'll just see if she
killed Bob Underhill instead.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.263
Yesterday you said you
had to accompany your mother

20:44.310 --> 20:46.301
to a doctor's appointment
in Scarsdale.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.035
That's right.
Only you didn't.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.570
You didn't even see her.

20:49.610 --> 20:53.046
You saw your
stepfather instead.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.243
May I assume your visit had
something to do with his book?

20:57.720 --> 20:59.347
You know about the book?

20:59.390 --> 21:01.915
An hour ago, I signed for
a box which contained nearly

21:01.960 --> 21:04.724
200 copies... but I've been
aware of it for months.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.625
An associate brought it
to my attention.

21:08.330 --> 21:09.729
You read it?
I did.

21:09.760 --> 21:11.466
You're not mad?
Should I be?

21:11.500 --> 21:13.024
Of course you should,
you're you.

21:14.540 --> 21:15.632
It's hardly the first time

21:15.670 --> 21:16.989
I've inspired a writer, Watson.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.031
I am actually
the basis

21:19.070 --> 21:22.039
for several ficti_onal characters
across varIous medIa.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.843
It's one of the
by-products

21:23.880 --> 21:25.074
of my success as a detective.

21:25.110 --> 21:27.078
I fascinate;
this cannot be helped.

21:27.110 --> 21:29.670
You yourself
once wrote about me:

21:29.720 --> 21:31.608
The Casebook
of Sherlock Holmes.

21:31.650 --> 21:33.083
When did you...?

21:33.120 --> 21:33.779
I was displeased because
you used my real name

21:33.820 --> 21:35.685
and you shared my real history.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.756
Your father's magnum opus,
on the other hand,

21:37.790 --> 21:39.758
is the very opposite of real.

21:39.790 --> 21:41.951
Look no further than chapter 32,
where we make love

21:42.000 --> 21:43.627
beneath a footbridge
in Central Park.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.968
Why didn't you tell me about it?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.093
The book, not chapter 32.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.096
Your stepfather uses pseudonym,

21:50.140 --> 21:52.108
and I assumed you were
the reason for that.

21:52.140 --> 21:53.835
(sighs)

21:53.880 --> 21:55.836
You seem angrier
than I'd expected.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.541
May I ask why?

21:58.750 --> 22:00.718
(doorbell buzzes)

22:00.750 --> 22:02.809
Are you expecting someone?

22:06.820 --> 22:09.618
I got your address off the card
you left with my parents.

22:09.660 --> 22:11.059
You mean, your marks.

22:12.730 --> 22:14.948
They think I'm
at my tutor's right now.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.729
Can I come in?

22:16.760 --> 22:17.727
I'm not sure you should.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.567
There's no wood chipper in here.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.966
Uh... you can frisk me.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.399
Whatever you want.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.032
I... I just want to talk.

22:33.050 --> 22:35.018
You're right about
a lot of things.

22:35.050 --> 22:36.938
But you're wrong about others.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.380
You admit you're not
Mina Davenport.

22:39.420 --> 22:42.389
I do.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.786
But I didn't kill that FBI guy.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.786
And why should we believe you?

22:46.830 --> 22:47.819
Because...

22:49.860 --> 22:51.691
...I can tell you who did.

22:53.970 --> 22:55.062
Richard and Nancy.

22:55.100 --> 22:57.068
The Davenports?

22:57.100 --> 22:59.034
And why, pray tell,
would they murder the man

22:59.070 --> 23:00.901
who worked so hard
to find their daughter?

23:00.940 --> 23:03.909
Because...

23:03.950 --> 23:05.941
he was about to figure out
their secret.

23:07.150 --> 23:09.710
No one took Mina.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.388
They killed her.

23:18.490 --> 23:19.388
My real name is Cassie,

23:19.430 --> 23:21.819
but you can call me Mina,
if it's easier.

23:21.860 --> 23:22.952
I'm used to it.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.491
You have a second name?

23:25.530 --> 23:28.533
For the purpose
of this conversation, no.

23:28.570 --> 23:31.164
There's a reason I came to talk
to you and not the po|Ice.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.166
Do tell.

23:33.210 --> 23:36.008
_ Mina turns 21
In a couple of weeks.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.838
Or, at least she would have.

23:38.880 --> 23:41.474
When that happens,
I get access to her trust.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.976
There's almost
five million in it.

23:43.020 --> 23:44.988
If you keep
my secret until then,

23:45.020 --> 23:47.181
I'll tell you everything.

23:47.220 --> 23:50.724
I'll even be your eyes
and ears inside the house.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.081
You... you think
I'm lying again.

23:53.130 --> 23:55.098
Why would we not?

23:55.130 --> 23:58.099
A couple of years ago, I came
across this magazine article.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.690
It was the anniversary
of Mina's disappearance,

24:00.740 --> 24:02.162
and they did this computer thing

24:02.200 --> 24:04.930
to show what she would look like
if she were still alive.

24:04.970 --> 24:06.938
I realized I looked like her.

24:06.970 --> 24:09.734
Not a lot,
but enough.

24:09.780 --> 24:11.748
I thought if
I studied the case,

24:11.780 --> 24:14.749
ifI learned everything
I could about her,

24:14.780 --> 24:16.247
I could fool people.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.544
Because you'd run cons before?

24:18.590 --> 24:20.558
Nothing like this.

24:20.590 --> 24:22.558
This was big.

24:22.590 --> 24:24.558
_ I had to trick
MIna's own parents.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.956
So you came up with a story
that would allow

24:26.990 --> 24:28.958
for the occasional trip-up.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.558
You were abused,
locked in a basement,

24:30.600 --> 24:32.192
you forgot your old life;
that way,

24:32.230 --> 24:34.960
no one would be suspicious when
you had trouble remembering

24:35.000 --> 24:37.139
things the real Mina
would have known.

24:37.170 --> 24:39.138
My favorite wrinkle
was Keith's truck.

24:39.170 --> 24:42.139
You said you'd escaped from it,
as opposed to the house,

24:42.180 --> 24:44.978
because, like Keith,
the house didn't exist,

24:45.010 --> 24:48.810
and you didn't have to worry
about leading anyone back to it.

24:48.850 --> 24:52.809
I was never worried about
fooling the police or the FBI.

24:52.850 --> 24:54.511
Just Richard and Nancy.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.949
I had this whole
script ready,

24:56.990 --> 24:58.218
things I would say or do,

24:58.260 --> 25:00.626
if I thought they were
getting suspicious.

25:00.660 --> 25:04.096
Only... I never needed it.

25:04.130 --> 25:05.995
They treated me
like their daughter

25:06.030 --> 25:07.588
from the second I met them.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.097
At first I thought
I was just that good.

25:10.140 --> 25:14.531
But a couple months ago,
something happened.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.536
I, um...

25:16.580 --> 25:20.004
I woke up in the middle
of the night and...

25:20.050 --> 25:22.678
Richard was sitting there.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.688
He touched my arm.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.087
He said this was something
he and Mina used to do.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.557
He said, "You are
my little girl, aren't you?"

25:37.060 --> 25:39.597
You get it, right?

25:39.630 --> 25:42.997
He knew I wasn't her
because he'd killed her.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.598
He was abusing her.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.902
She must have threatened
to tell someone and...

25:45.940 --> 25:48.170
You said Nancy
was involved, too.

25:48.210 --> 25:51.646
No one worked harder to teach me
about Mina's old life.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.648
She needed to make sure
no one else knew

25:53.680 --> 25:55.079
I wasn't really
her daughter.

25:55.120 --> 25:56.269
Because that would guarantee

25:56.320 --> 25:58.811
no one would uncover
RIchard's crIme.

25:58.850 --> 26:01.648
He lied to you the other night.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.658
The FBI guy had come
to the house.

26:03.690 --> 26:05.055
I saw them arguing

26:05.090 --> 26:07.650
in the driveway that night.
I didn't

26:07.700 --> 26:10.999
know who he was, so I didn't
think much of it at the time,

26:11.030 --> 26:13.294
but then, when you guys came
to the house, I...

26:13.330 --> 26:16.891
He figured me out.
He must have.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.067
So Richard killed him.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.176
Two weeks--
that's all I need.

26:25.210 --> 26:29.146
You keep all of this
between us...

26:29.180 --> 26:31.910
and I'll help you
get justice for Mina.

26:33.190 --> 26:35.886
Deal.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.184
These are listening devices.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.186
Bugs.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.152
I need you to plant one
on the first floor

26:42.200 --> 26:44.725
of the Davenports' home
and one on the second.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.933
This one's sort of big.
It's imperative

26:47.970 --> 26:50.029
you put both of them
near windows.

26:50.070 --> 26:52.004
This will make it easier for us

26:52.040 --> 26:53.928
to pick up
and record their conversations.

26:53.980 --> 26:56.835
Have I made
myself clear?
Yeah.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.074
So why are you still here?

27:05.790 --> 27:09.749
I know I did something terrible.

27:09.790 --> 27:12.122
But Richard and Nancy
did something worse.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.025
You won't

27:14.060 --> 27:15.823
regret this, I promise.

27:21.470 --> 27:23.097
(sighs)

27:23.140 --> 27:25.301
You're almost as good
of a liar as she is.

27:25.340 --> 27:27.137
She actually thinks
you believe her.

27:27.170 --> 27:28.933
She's obviously attempting
to divert attention

27:28.980 --> 27:31.198
until she can claim Mina's
trust money and dIsappear.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.445
Then why did you just
give her two bugs?

27:33.480 --> 27:34.947
You know she's not gonna
say anything incriminating

27:34.980 --> 27:37.141
when she's around them.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.716
Actually, Watson,
only one of them is a bug.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.445
The other is a flash bang.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.185
You gave her a bomb?

27:42.220 --> 27:44.120
It's a very small bomb
with a very big bang.

27:44.160 --> 27:46.856
Tomorrow morning, I will
activate the listening device,

27:46.890 --> 27:49.256
and when I'm certain all three
famIIy members are on one floor,

27:49.300 --> 27:50.892
I'll detonate the flash bang
on the other.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.090
If they don't call
the police themselves,

27:52.130 --> 27:54.064
one of their neighbors will.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.193
And then we can poke around
their house without a warrant

27:56.240 --> 27:58.037
and collect all
the DNA we want.

27:58.070 --> 28:00.129
The Davenports aren't
gonna trust

28:00.170 --> 28:02.877
any test results from us,
not after today.

28:02.910 --> 28:05.105
As I said earlier,
I'm only interested

28:05.150 --> 28:07.175
in whether our imposter
killed Bob Underhill.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.713
His murder was
espeCIally VIolent.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.217
She would have been
covered in his blood.

28:11.250 --> 28:14.048
If she carried any trace of it
back to the house,

28:14.090 --> 28:18.049
we'll have her, no matter who
the Davenports think she is.

28:18.090 --> 28:19.785
(siren whooping,
indistinct radio communication)

28:22.030 --> 28:23.918
(indistinct chatter)

28:23.970 --> 28:26.325
I thought you said
it was a small bomb.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.267
No, no! No, you people are not
coming into my home!

28:31.310 --> 28:33.369
Mr. Davenport, we are here
to help you, believe it or not.

28:33.410 --> 28:35.173
Oh, like hell
you are.

28:35.210 --> 28:36.802
GREGSON:
Mr. Davenport, I
understand you're not

28:36.840 --> 28:38.273
happy to see any of us,

28:38.310 --> 28:40.403
but when a bomb goes off
on your property,

28:40.450 --> 28:43.248
you don't get to pick
and choose who investigates.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.089
May we assume
the explosive device

28:45.120 --> 28:46.314
was not yours, Mr. Davenport?

28:46.350 --> 28:48.318
Of course it wasn't.
Well, then, you have

28:48.360 --> 28:50.089
our word we will not rest

28:50.120 --> 28:52.122
until the guilty party
has been identified.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.190
So, uh...

29:00.230 --> 29:02.460
(low, indistinct talking)

29:07.570 --> 29:09.276
Hey, I checked
the security system.

29:09.310 --> 29:11.198
It was enabled,
but it wasn't tripped.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.377
No signs that anyone broke in
to plant the device.

29:13.410 --> 29:15.241
Got to be the girl, right?

29:15.280 --> 29:17.009
What are the chances
of this happening

29:17.050 --> 29:20.019
one day after we accuse her
of running a con?

29:20.050 --> 29:22.211
Yeah, but the upside? She gets
to play the victim card again?

29:22.260 --> 29:23.887
WATSON:
Whatever her reasons were,

29:23.930 --> 29:25.352
we should be glad.

29:25.390 --> 29:27.051
We have all morning to look
for proof she killed Underhill.

29:27.090 --> 29:28.318
BELL:
That was a bust, too.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.920
Her bedroom
and bathroom were spotless.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.564
Nothing in the drains,
the carpet or the hamper.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.569
Kitchen and, uh, laundry
room were equally clean, but

29:36.600 --> 29:38.966
let's not forget the obscenity
of the Davenports' wealth.

29:39.010 --> 29:41.501
By my count,
we still have ten rooms to go.

29:41.540 --> 29:44.475
All right, let's check out CSU,
and see how they're doing.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.389
It's because
he cheated on my mother.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.251
My stepfather.

29:54.290 --> 29:57.885
You asked me yesterday why
I was so angry about the book.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.319
Yes, I remember,
and I recall the affair,

30:00.360 --> 30:02.294
but what one has to do
with the other...?

30:02.330 --> 30:04.298
He was always
a free spirit,

30:04.330 --> 30:06.218
adventurous,
did what he wanted

30:06.270 --> 30:08.090
when he wanted.
I loved that about him.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.233
Until what he wanted was
something other than Mary.

30:10.270 --> 30:11.532
It wasn't even serious.

30:11.570 --> 30:13.970
Just some woman
he met at a book SIgnIng,

30:14.010 --> 30:17.104
back when he was still putting
his name on his own work.

30:17.140 --> 30:20.075
And then my mother found out.

30:20.110 --> 30:22.271
Well, she's a proud woman.
I'm sure it was difficult.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.288
Well, things weren't
the same after that.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.016
She and my father
patched things up,

30:27.050 --> 30:28.859
but I don't know.

30:28.890 --> 30:31.586
I guess I kept him
at arm's length.

30:31.630 --> 30:35.350
And then, when he wrote
that book, it was like

30:37.900 --> 30:39.959
Speaking of people who think
they can get away with things,

30:40.000 --> 30:41.262
look at the seat.

30:41.300 --> 30:43.165
Note how close it is
to the pedals.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.031
This has been adjusted
for somebody short,

30:45.070 --> 30:47.334
not Richard Davenport, who by
my estimation is six foot tall.

30:47.370 --> 30:49.008
Nancy, meanwhile,
drives this SUV.

30:49.040 --> 30:50.974
I know 'cause
I saw her keys

30:51.010 --> 30:52.443
at the station yesterday.

30:53.350 --> 30:54.612
So you think

30:54.650 --> 30:56.345
this is the car
the imposter drives.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.911
Look at the brake pedal.

31:03.490 --> 31:05.185
WATSON :
Blood.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.380
Agent Underhill's,
I presume,

31:07.430 --> 31:11.298
transferred from the bottom
of his killer's shoe.

31:11.330 --> 31:12.365
(doorbell buzzes)

31:12.400 --> 31:13.389
(door opening)

31:15.100 --> 31:17.261
Dad, what are you doing here?

31:17.300 --> 31:18.608
Well, I have something for you,

31:18.640 --> 31:21.006
and I thought
I'd drop it off in person.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.469
Come in.

31:28.950 --> 31:31.441
Wow. Really love what
you've done with this place.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.946
I'll tell Sherlock.

31:32.990 --> 31:34.548
I'm sure he can do the
same for you and Mom.

31:34.590 --> 31:37.286
Is he around?
No, he's at the precinct.

31:37.320 --> 31:41.393
Uh, we're waiting to hear
about some blood that we found.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.091
Oh, that sounds exciting.

31:43.130 --> 31:45.064
So did you talk
to your publisher?

31:45.100 --> 31:46.522
(sighing)
Hey, the wheels are in motion.

31:46.570 --> 31:49.562
I don't know the ins and
the outs, but suffice it to say

31:49.600 --> 31:51.431
that The Heart Bled Blue
is about

31:51.470 --> 31:53.506
to become very difficult
to find.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.432
I appreciate that.

31:56.480 --> 31:58.141
Mm-hmm.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.247
What's this?

32:00.280 --> 32:02.510
Uh, that's the sequel.

32:04.320 --> 32:06.083
You wrote another book
based on me and Sherlock?

32:06.120 --> 32:09.317
Wait-- before you take my head
off, I already told the editor

32:09.360 --> 32:11.248
that he can't have it;
it's all yours.

32:11.290 --> 32:13.429
I was just putting
the finishing touches on it

32:13.460 --> 32:15.394
when you came
by the house the other day.

32:15.430 --> 32:17.318
I don't understand.
Is this for me to burn?

32:17.360 --> 32:20.329
That's for you to do with
whatever you like.

32:20.370 --> 32:23.669
I missed you, Joanie,
and that's the real reason

32:23.700 --> 32:25.429
I wrote about you.

32:25.470 --> 32:27.028
I mean, these last few years,

32:27.070 --> 32:30.369
ever since I... strayed...

32:30.410 --> 32:32.708
You know, I know
that I screwed up.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.570
I knew it the moment
that it happened.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.111
But what I didn't know,
what I wasn't ready for,

32:37.150 --> 32:38.515
was what it would do to us.

32:38.550 --> 32:42.088
You used to be my friend.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.554
And I ruined that.

32:46.260 --> 32:49.559
The book is just my way
of dealing with it.

32:49.600 --> 32:52.489
It let me be close to you again.

32:56.570 --> 32:58.060
(phone ringing)

32:58.110 --> 33:01.477
Hmm. No rest for the weary.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.577
Dad, just...

33:03.610 --> 33:05.248
just hold on, okay?

33:05.280 --> 33:09.171
(ringing continues)

33:09.220 --> 33:11.017
Hello?

33:11.050 --> 33:13.644
HOLMES: The blood on the brake
pedal came from Bob Underhill.

33:13.690 --> 33:16.454
I didn't think we'd hear back
from the lab this quickly.

33:16.490 --> 33:18.549
We didn't hear
back from the lab.

33:18.590 --> 33:20.581
We heard from
Richard Davenport.

33:20.630 --> 33:23.121
He's here, and he claims

33:23.160 --> 33:26.197
he killed Underhill,
and he wants to confess.

33:33.210 --> 33:36.202
HOLMES:
Oh, she's told him a sob
story. She must have.

33:36.240 --> 33:39.471
Something along the lines of,
"The mean FBI man confronted me,

33:39.510 --> 33:41.819
"accused me of all the things
the police did.

33:41.850 --> 33:44.614
I was frightened,
I snapped."

33:44.650 --> 33:46.811
He's still utterly convinced
she's his daughter.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.212
what happened to the real Mina.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.285
In 2004, he couldn't save her.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.093
In 2015, he can.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.257
Well, however she did it,
she's forcing our hand.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.121
We either got to charge him
or find some way of proving

33:59.170 --> 34:00.296
that he's covering for her.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.763
HOLMES: I think the
choice is clear.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.303
Mina, or whatever her name is,

34:04.340 --> 34:08.333
in a rush to escape a murder
charge, has made a mistake.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.099
Accept the false confession
and book Richard Davenport.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.540
That will make it easier
to obtain a sample of his DNA.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.116
WATSON: _
We can compare It
to the samples

34:16.150 --> 34:17.469
that were taken
from the imposter

34:17.520 --> 34:19.385
when she turned up last year.

34:19.420 --> 34:21.411
We can show him the results.
There you go.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.849
I'm not sure that would have
been enough to conVInce hIm,

34:23.890 --> 34:27.326
but now, staring down the barrel
of life in prison,

34:27.360 --> 34:30.227
we might be able
to get him to see the light.

34:32.470 --> 34:33.869
WATSON:
The DNA was a match?

34:33.900 --> 34:35.834
This can't be right.
All I can tell you is

34:35.870 --> 34:37.428
what the lab told me.

34:37.470 --> 34:38.767
The girl's DNA is

34:38.810 --> 34:41.370
a familial match
to Richard Davenport.

34:41.410 --> 34:43.878
According to the report,
she's his daughter.

34:43.910 --> 34:46.504
It's the same results
as the orIgInal report

34:46.550 --> 34:48.245
that matched her to
Mina's toothbrush.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.508
Now, I know you thought
she had an accomplice,

34:49.550 --> 34:51.415
someone on the inside.

34:51.450 --> 34:53.384
This test was
done In-house.

34:53.420 --> 34:55.251
We put a rush on it.

34:55.290 --> 34:56.609
There is no way she could have
effected the results.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.423
HOLMES:
Then someone made a mistake.

34:58.460 --> 35:00.883
The girl that we're dealing
with is not Mina Davenport.

35:00.930 --> 35:03.728
Her genetic material
says otherwise.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.296
What about her ears?

35:05.330 --> 35:07.469
It doesn't trump a DNA test.

35:07.500 --> 35:09.365
It says there that Richard
Davenport's DNA was compared

35:09.400 --> 35:11.402
to a sample of the
imposter's hair.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.658
That's right.
Wouldn't it have been
standard procedure

35:13.710 --> 35:15.507
to take a cheek
swab when she was

35:15.540 --> 35:17.371
oh-so-miraculously
found 14 months ago?

35:17.410 --> 35:21.449
It would, but the FBI said
she was in such a feral state,

35:21.480 --> 35:23.175
she wouldn't
let anyone near her.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.847
So they bagged the hair

35:24.890 --> 35:27.211
that she had cutoff
in the gas station bathroom.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.512
BELL:
Maybe she's not Mina,

35:28.560 --> 35:31.449
but she is Davenport's daughter.

35:31.490 --> 35:33.651
Well, say he had
an affair.

35:33.690 --> 35:35.396
The girl was born
out of wedlock.

35:35.430 --> 35:37.523
She pretended to be Mina
to mess with him,

35:37.560 --> 35:39.824
get everything she
thought she deserved.

35:39.870 --> 35:42.168
Well, that would actually
explain a lot.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.792
No.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.330
Respectfully, Detective,
I don't like that theory.

35:45.370 --> 35:46.507
That's a bad theory.

35:46.540 --> 35:48.838
GREGSON:
Why is it a bad theory?

35:48.880 --> 35:50.677
'Cause it wouldn't account
for Mina, the real Mina,

35:50.710 --> 35:52.507
and what happened
to her in 2004.

35:52.550 --> 35:54.370
BELL:
It's not supposed to.
It's supposed to

35:54.420 --> 35:57.378
explain how a girl we think
is a fraud passed a DNA test.

35:57.420 --> 35:59.388
I've got a different
theory-- better one.

35:59.420 --> 36:00.717
I mean, I-I prefer it.

36:02.220 --> 36:03.482
Trust me when I say

36:03.520 --> 36:04.885
that you will, too.

36:09.630 --> 36:12.428
Mrs. Davenport,
thank you so much for coming.

36:12.470 --> 36:13.960
This is my attorney,

36:14.000 --> 36:15.490
Mr. O'Donnell.

36:15.540 --> 36:16.438
HOLMES:
Earlier today,

36:16.470 --> 36:18.404
the woman that you know
as your daughter...

36:18.440 --> 36:20.305
She is my daughter.

36:20.340 --> 36:22.376
She passed a DNA test,

36:22.410 --> 36:24.503
or at least a strand
of her hair did.

36:24.550 --> 36:25.676
It was a familial match

36:25.710 --> 36:27.575
for a cheek swab
taken from your husband.

36:27.610 --> 36:29.316
WATSON: The thing is,
that hair did not

36:29.350 --> 36:30.510
come directly from Mina's head.

36:30.550 --> 36:32.541
It was one of the hairs
that she claimed

36:32.590 --> 36:33.818
_ she cut off
WIth a straIght razor

36:33.850 --> 36:36.557
the day she was found.
Claimed?

36:36.590 --> 36:38.683
This was the second test
she passed. We were suspICIous

36:38.730 --> 36:40.857
of the test she
took 14 months ago,

36:40.890 --> 36:42.528
because Mina's toothbrush,
the source

36:42.560 --> 36:43.857
of the comparison sample--
disappeared.

36:43.900 --> 36:45.561
But then, this morning,

36:45.600 --> 36:47.329
when the results
of the second test arrived,

36:47.370 --> 36:48.598
we wondered what if the loss

36:48.640 --> 36:50.699
of the toothbrush
really was human error?

36:50.740 --> 36:52.958
What if she had passed
both tests because the hair

36:53.010 --> 36:55.478
that was examined_
really dId come from MIna?

36:55.510 --> 36:57.432
You're not making any sense.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.846
Please.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.686
HOLMES:
It occurred to me that
if someone had access

37:11.730 --> 37:13.948
to Mina's hair 14 months ago,

37:13.990 --> 37:16.925
then they also
had access to Mina...

37:19.600 --> 37:21.693
to take a straight razor
to her head willingly.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.800
So we reached out to law
enforcement across the country.

37:24.840 --> 37:28.571
We found a report of an assault
in Sturbridge, Massachusetts,

37:28.610 --> 37:30.532
where a young woman
wearing a mask

37:30.580 --> 37:33.572
attacked another young woman
and shaved her head.

37:33.610 --> 37:35.714
HOLMES:
Not the kind of crime
you see every day.

37:35.750 --> 37:37.445
Even more remarkable--

37:37.480 --> 37:40.449
the assault was perpetrated
just two days...

37:40.490 --> 37:42.617
before the imposter was found

37:42.660 --> 37:45.288
in Lander, Pennsylvania.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.821
She'd located Mina, you see.

37:47.860 --> 37:49.748
And instead of reporting it
to the authorities,

37:49.800 --> 37:52.724
she took her hair.

37:52.770 --> 37:53.998
She then scattered that

37:54.030 --> 37:55.634
around in Pennsylvania

37:55.670 --> 37:57.490
as if it was her own.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.303
The victim
of the Sturbridge attack

37:59.340 --> 38:01.501
gave a fake name
at the hospital.

38:01.540 --> 38:04.771
She was signed out
by a man named Norman Ott.

38:04.810 --> 38:07.802
Mr. Ott, it turns out, lived
near Mina's school in 2004.

38:07.850 --> 38:09.511
His apartment was on a route

38:09.550 --> 38:10.676
she would've taken home.

38:12.550 --> 38:15.417
It's really her, Nancy.
It's really Mina.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.520
It... No.

38:18.560 --> 38:21.358
I... It can't...

38:21.400 --> 38:22.924
HOLMES:
When the police

38:22.960 --> 38:25.690
paid a visit to Mr. Ott's
home in Sturbridge today;

38:25.730 --> 38:27.721
he wasn't home,

38:27.770 --> 38:30.534
but Mina was.

38:30.570 --> 38:33.539
WATSON: Over the years, he told
different stories about her.

38:33.570 --> 38:35.731
Some people thought
she was his daughter.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.577
Others thought
she was his wife.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.908
The only thing we know for sure

38:39.950 --> 38:42.839
is that she was allowed
to leave the house sometimes.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.849
That's how the imposter was
able to gain access to her.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.609
HOLMES: You can imagine
she's been through

38:48.660 --> 38:52.926
quite an ordeal, but she
remembers you and Richard,

38:52.960 --> 38:54.689
and she's been asking for you.

38:54.730 --> 38:56.698
So as soon as he's recanted
hIs confeSSIon,

38:56.730 --> 38:59.426
he'll be brought here.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.933
Would you like me
to take you to see her?

39:03.970 --> 39:05.528
(quiet sob)

39:46.010 --> 39:47.739
Hi. Joanie, what are you...?

39:47.780 --> 39:50.419
I'm sorry I got so angry
about the book.

39:50.450 --> 39:53.840
Oh, you don't have anything
to apologize for. Come in.

39:53.890 --> 39:55.551
Well, I've changed my mind.

39:55.590 --> 39:57.080
I'm okay
with it being out there,

39:57.120 --> 39:59.054
so whatever you told
your publishers to do,

39:59.090 --> 40:01.593
you can tell them to stop.
It's all right.

40:01.630 --> 40:03.188
You're sure?

40:03.230 --> 40:05.425
I read the sequel.

40:07.730 --> 40:10.096
I actually think it's
better than the ﬁrst.

40:14.810 --> 40:17.904
Yeah. A-And you...
you made some notes.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.669
Just a few.

40:19.710 --> 40:21.974
I thought we could spend some
time and talk about them.

40:23.220 --> 40:24.915
Well...

40:24.950 --> 40:27.009
it would be an honor.

40:27.050 --> 40:30.952
* All we do is hide away

40:30.990 --> 40:34.790
* All we do is,
all we do is hide away... *

40:34.830 --> 40:36.058
HOLMES: Cassie?

40:36.100 --> 40:37.624
* All we do
is chase the day... *

40:37.660 --> 40:39.662
Mind ifI call you Cassie?

40:39.700 --> 40:43.192
I'd call you by your real name,
but you're refusing to give it.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.107
Cassie is fine.

40:47.970 --> 40:49.779
Sorry I missed your arrest
and booking,

40:49.810 --> 40:52.938
but I've been coordinating
the effort to identify you.

40:52.980 --> 40:56.040
To my great surprise, your
fingerprints weren't in AFIS.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.048
Of course they aren't.

40:58.080 --> 40:59.741
I've never committed any crimes.

40:59.790 --> 41:00.939
You've never been caught.

41:00.990 --> 41:03.117
Is there a difference?

41:04.930 --> 41:06.488
So how old are you? Really?

41:06.530 --> 41:07.827
Fifteen.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.993
No, wait.

41:12.030 --> 41:13.566
Twenty-five.

41:14.870 --> 41:17.862
Or maybe it's some other number.

41:17.900 --> 41:22.075
My colleagues showed your
photograph to Mina Davenport.

41:22.110 --> 41:23.805
She says
she's never seen you before.

41:23.840 --> 41:26.001
You're also a stranger

41:26.050 --> 41:27.574
to Norman Ott.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.749
_ He was taken
Into custody yesterday.

41:29.780 --> 41:31.145
VVho?

41:31.180 --> 41:33.887
He wasn't lying when he said
he never met you before.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.888
I could tell.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.599
Would you at least concede you
spent some time in Sturbridge?

41:41.630 --> 41:44.053
How else would you know
about Mina's situation?

41:44.100 --> 41:46.068
I've been to lots of places.

41:46.100 --> 41:47.863
Have you enjoyed them?

41:47.900 --> 41:49.868
'Cause your time
of coming and going

41:49.900 --> 41:51.231
is now squarely in the past.

41:51.270 --> 41:55.570
You think I killed
that FBI agent, but...

41:55.610 --> 41:57.578
you don't have a murder weapon,

41:57.610 --> 42:00.704
just some blood in a car.

42:00.750 --> 42:03.776
I've already come up with six
different ways to explain it.

42:04.790 --> 42:05.779
Tell me one.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.114
(sighs):
Um...

42:09.890 --> 42:12.120
I hope you come to my trial.

42:12.160 --> 42:13.650
Should be fun.

42:14.860 --> 42:16.657
Think you can lie your way out?

42:16.700 --> 42:17.997
I do.

42:20.900 --> 42:23.789
Now tell me...

42:23.840 --> 42:25.262
am I lying?

42:25.310 --> 42:28.802
* All we do is,
all we do is hide away *

42:28.840 --> 42:30.979
* All we do is chase the day

42:33.010 --> 42:36.218
* All we do is,
all we do is chase the day *

42:36.250 --> 42:40.186
* All I did was fail today

42:40.220 --> 42:44.281
* All I want to be is whites
In waves *

42:44.320 --> 42:47.881
* All I did was fail today

42:47.930 --> 42:51.229
* All we do, all we do...

42:51.260 --> 42:53.319
