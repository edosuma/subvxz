[Lucifer gasping] Who are you?

00:15.682 --> 00:16.808
I'm your daughter!

00:16.891 --> 00:19.227
[panting] That's impossible.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.937
And yet here I am.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.064
[Lucifer] I never met you before.

00:23.148 --> 00:24.733
Well, I guess that's what happens

00:24.816 --> 00:27.360
when you abandon your child
before she's even born.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.987
-Did not.
-Did too.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.405
-Did not.
-Did too!

00:30.488 --> 00:33.033
[splutters, laughs] Okay.

00:33.116 --> 00:36.494
Look, you can't be my daughter
because angels can't procreate.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.079
Amenadiel did.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.581
Not helping, Daniel.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.084
Lucifer, look me in the eyes and tell me.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.837
-[sighs]
-Tell me I'm not your daughter!

00:45.920 --> 00:49.215
Will this little paternity test get you
to holster these wings of death?

00:50.633 --> 00:51.593
[grunts]

00:53.094 --> 00:53.928

00:54.929 --> 00:55.972
Thank you.

[gasps, pants]

00:58.808 --> 00:59.642
Now…

00:59.726 --> 01:01.186
[panting]

01:01.269 --> 01:04.230
…can I get you a drink or a Xanax, maybe?

01:04.314 --> 01:07.859
Oh! Fine, fine. [exhales]

01:08.693 --> 01:10.779
[sighs] I don't believe this.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.988
[chuckles]

01:31.341 --> 01:33.218
Well, I'm sorry, but you can't be.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.186
-Well, I am!
-Boo!

01:45.980 --> 01:49.234
Look, I'm sorry that
your father abandoned you. Truly.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.819
I know how painful that is,

01:50.902 --> 01:55.532
but I promise you,
you are not my daughter.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.159
[grunts]

02:00.286 --> 02:01.246
You know what?

02:02.497 --> 02:04.582
I'm actually glad you abandoned me.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.043
[inhales] Wouldn't want you
to be my dad anyway.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.339
[wings flapping]

02:12.507 --> 02:13.591
Who was that?

02:17.887 --> 02:20.306
And how's it possible
there's an angel I've never met?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.934
I don't know, but you're welcome.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.686
"You're welcome"?

02:25.186 --> 02:26.062
Yeah.

02:26.771 --> 02:27.605
So…

02:29.065 --> 02:30.316
beam me up!

02:32.110 --> 02:33.319
Oh, Daniel.

02:35.155 --> 02:38.199
You know that I want to help you,
but we've been through this before.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.743
-That's not how it works!
-Yeah, I know.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.246
I know it's all about my own guilt,
but I figured it out, man.

02:43.329 --> 02:46.040
You see, I was feeling guilty
for betraying you to Michael,

02:46.124 --> 02:49.878
but I just saved your life,
so even-steven. Huh?

02:49.961 --> 02:51.379
Up we go!

02:53.381 --> 02:54.215
Come on.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.679
Why am I still here?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.682
Well, you must feel guilty
about something else.

03:03.975 --> 03:05.143
[exhales]

03:05.852 --> 03:08.980
Or maybe you actually have
no idea how any of this works.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.567
As former ruler of Hell,
and soon-to-be ruler of the full monty,

03:12.650 --> 03:15.445
I believe I'm the only one
who knows how any of this works.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.948
Really? Well, you had no idea that
you were able to bring me up to Earth,

03:19.032 --> 03:20.867
and yet here I am, in the flesh.

03:21.659 --> 03:22.493
Kind of.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.663
Of course I knew that.
I just didn't think it was for the best.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.041
So you did know?

03:29.417 --> 03:31.836
And yet you still left me
in ping-pong purgatory

03:31.920 --> 03:34.797
to return Belios' pathetic backhand
for thousands of years?

03:34.881 --> 03:35.715
Exactly.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.308
Wow.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.894
[inhales] You know what, man?

03:47.977 --> 03:50.104
You have no idea what's right for me.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.106
You stay away from me.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.400
Daniel.

-Hi.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.423
So, since we went to Hell,
I've been thinking a lot about Heaven.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.967
[chuckles] Like, all night.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.010
And since you're finally
ready to become God

04:21.094 --> 04:24.013
and I will be your partner up there,
I have a few questions.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.056
Do you have a second?

04:25.139 --> 04:27.267
-I was on my way to see Amenadiel.
-Okay, so number one.

04:27.350 --> 04:30.478
Time goes much faster in Hell
than it does on Earth,

04:30.561 --> 04:33.731
so is it the same in Heaven?
I mean, say I'm up there for a year.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.109
How long am I gone on Earth,
for, like, a minute?

04:36.192 --> 04:38.528
And then number two, if that is the case,

04:38.611 --> 04:40.905
would Trixie even notice
if I'm gone for the day?

04:40.989 --> 04:44.200
Because I've just been so nervous
to talk to her about this, you know,

04:44.284 --> 04:45.576

04:45.660 --> 04:48.413

Are you even gonna have time

04:49.956 --> 04:52.041
to fly me up and down every time,
or are you gonna,

04:52.125 --> 04:55.336
what, blink your eyes
and beam me up whenever you want to?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.630
Why does everyone think
"beaming up" is a thing?

04:57.714 --> 05:00.800
Look, everything is going to be fine.

05:16.190 --> 05:19.068
I know you do, Detective. [chuckles]

05:19.152 --> 05:23.448
But there's nothing to be scared about,
I promise. I'll be right there beside you.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.576
Okay.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.744
[chuckles]

05:28.578 --> 05:31.873
[exhales] I can't believe
this is finally happening.

[chuckles, groans]

05:37.420 --> 05:38.254
What's wrong?

05:38.838 --> 05:42.300
Well, I just need to take care
of a little misunderstanding first.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.259
What happened?

05:44.260 --> 05:47.055
-Is it Dan? Did you find him?
-No, Daniel is…

05:47.972 --> 05:48.973
He's fine. Um…

05:49.057 --> 05:52.226
No, this is something else,
which will be cleared up in no time,

05:52.310 --> 05:54.228
and then we will be off to Heaven.

05:54.312 --> 05:56.647
And we will figure things out together.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.815

Brother!

06:13.122 --> 06:14.791
Why haven't you answered my calls?

06:14.874 --> 06:17.502
There has been
a catastrophic miscarriage of justice.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.171
Is this another excuse
to put off being God?

06:20.254 --> 06:22.256
No, no, this is about some rando angel

06:22.340 --> 06:25.176
flying around,
accusing me of being her father.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.929
An angel that we don't know about.
Describe her.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.305
Well, I don't know.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.016
Early 20s. Resting mean face.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.684

06:33.768 --> 06:37.230
Combative, rebellious
and says that I abandoned her.

06:37.313 --> 06:41.025
Hmm. Sounds like someone I know.
Maybe she is your daughter, Lucy.

06:41.109 --> 06:45.238
Ha-ha! Do I need to remind you
that angels cannot produce offspring?

06:45.321 --> 06:48.533
And need I remind you of your nephew?

06:48.616 --> 06:50.618
[groans] Well, that's different.

06:50.701 --> 06:52.954
You subconsciously
wanted to get closer to humanity,

06:53.037 --> 06:56.082
so you lost your powers
and made a baby. A human baby.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.544
This girl's an angel,
and I may do a lot of sinful things,

06:59.627 --> 07:01.379
but incest is not on the list.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.757
Well, you have certainly
slept with plenty of humans, so…

07:05.383 --> 07:06.217
Wait a minute.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.971
If you made an angel child
with one of them, then…

07:10.054 --> 07:12.974
then perhaps there's still a chance
Charlie could grow up to be an angel.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.892
Maybe his wings will pop out at puberty!

07:14.976 --> 07:17.937
Oh, yes, the three signs of puberty.
Acne, pubes and wings.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.106
Can we focus on my problem, please?

07:20.189 --> 07:21.482
Yes, yes, yes, okay.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.944
Well, Charlie appears to be growing
at a normal human rate.

07:25.027 --> 07:28.906
So I think we can assume that
your half-human baby would do the same.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.993
So, the only way
that you could be this girl's father is

07:32.076 --> 07:35.913
if you were on Earth around 20 years ago
when she was conceived.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.707
And had sex with a woman.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.044
I just assumed that every time you were
on Earth you had sex with a woman.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.463
Not always a woman, brother.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.006
True, true.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.593

-Of course not.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.473
Frosted tips? Dial-up? Creed?

07:57.310 --> 07:58.144
Oh, hang on.

07:59.103 --> 08:02.064
Hang on, I did pop up
to celebrate the end of the '90s.

so maybe he is too.

12:02.012 --> 12:06.183
He's probably just off somewhere
trying to deal with that.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.060
It's just, he hasn't done this since--

12:08.144 --> 12:11.188
February 2, 2017.

12:12.064 --> 12:12.940
Mm-hmm.

12:13.023 --> 12:16.444
When he disappeared to Vegas
and married Candy Morningstar.

12:16.527 --> 12:17.611
Mm-hmm.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.823
But what are the chances he'd run off
to Vegas and marry a stripper twice?

12:20.906 --> 12:22.199
[chuckles]

12:22.950 --> 12:26.996
Okay, but maybe-- maybe
what you're really worried about

12:27.079 --> 12:31.542
is maintaining your hard-fought level
of communication and trust.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.672
Yeah, I mean, our relationship,
our partnership has come so far.

12:36.756 --> 12:40.301
I just-- I just don't know why
he wouldn't just tell me what he's up to.

12:40.384 --> 12:43.345
Well, you're both
past the point of guessing games.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.473
Why don't you ask him?

12:47.516 --> 12:49.810
Right. Yes, I can-- I'll just find…

12:50.728 --> 12:53.022
Find out where he is,
and, yeah, I'll just ask him.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.106
There's, um…

12:54.190 --> 12:57.109
[chuckles] …this app I have that
sort of just tells me where he is.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.569
[chimes]

12:58.652 --> 12:59.570
He's where?

13:02.948 --> 13:04.950
[Mazikeen]
So I just sent you the info you wanted,

13:05.034 --> 13:06.952
but you gotta tell me what this is about.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.454
Call it a finder's fee.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.040
A young lady playing
"Pin the tail on the daddy"

13:11.123 --> 13:12.583
picked me as the ass.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.293
Well, good thing you're shooting blanks,

13:14.376 --> 13:16.962
or you'd have what,
10,000 Lucifer juniors running around?

13:17.046 --> 13:19.298
Ten-thousand seems a tad superfluous.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.509
Well, you did come down here
for one night in the '90s

13:21.592 --> 13:24.094
and managed to orgy it up with 36 people.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.638
It was Y2K!

13:25.721 --> 13:28.474
People were getting jiggy with it
left, right and center.

13:28.557 --> 13:30.643
[scoffs] Anyway,
did you manage to locate the women

13:30.726 --> 13:32.770
who gave birth to daughters
nine months later?

13:32.853 --> 13:35.648
Yeah, addresses for the four women
are in your inbox.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.858
Numero uno is the only one still in Miami.

13:37.942 --> 13:41.195
A dance teacher.
Ana Christina Perez Del Rio.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.657
Excellent. All I have to do is verify that
none of those women's daughters

13:44.740 --> 13:47.868
are the girl that showed up
at the penthouse, then it'll be clear.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.411
There's no way that kid is mine.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.580
Can't wait to watch the rerun
on Jerry Springer.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.498
Very funny.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.376
-[dance music playing]
-[woman] Great job!

13:55.459 --> 13:57.253
Work it, work it!

13:59.255 --> 14:02.091
More hips. Move those hips, come on!

14:02.174 --> 14:03.592
Nice job.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.177
[chuckles] Yes!

14:05.261 --> 14:06.595
Lucifer?

14:06.679 --> 14:10.266
I never thought I'd see you again.
You haven't changed a bit.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.978
Well, last time I saw you,
you were a Denver Broncos cheerleader.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.480
-Well…
-[laughing] Oh.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.023
Yes.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.400
We need to talk.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.070
-I do love a bit of salsa, on my chips.
-[laughing]

14:23.153 --> 14:25.364
I have missed your jokes. Mmm!

14:25.447 --> 14:28.158
-And a lot of other things too.
-I'm sure you have.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.996
People change. Except you, apparently.

14:32.079 --> 14:36.292
Ugh. Well, I certainly hope I'm the same
childless man I was back in '99.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.045
Don't lie. Is it good genes or Botox?

14:40.129 --> 14:41.088
Immortality.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.715
You should check out our next class.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.718
-I'm here on business and not pleasure.
-Oh.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.053
Is this your daughter?

14:48.137 --> 14:49.305
Kind of hard to tell.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.016
How about now?

14:52.099 --> 14:53.058
What are you playing at?

14:53.142 --> 14:56.770
Well, I'm trying to prove
that your daughter isn't also my daughter,

14:56.854 --> 15:00.316
so if you wouldn't mind showing me
a photograph or a picture…

15:00.399 --> 15:04.194
No need to worry, Lucifer, I always
triple-checked my IUD before an orgy.

15:04.278 --> 15:07.615
Lovely, I'm sure you did.
Irrespective of that, uh, a picture?

15:07.698 --> 15:10.743
Uh, or a tattoo. [scoffs]

15:10.826 --> 15:12.912
Thank me. I'm not the dad.

15:13.495 --> 15:16.582
One down, three to disprove.
I'm not the father. [chuckles]

15:16.665 --> 15:18.500
[sighs] Well,
she looks refreshingly unfamiliar.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.210
Thank me, I'm not the dad!

15:20.294 --> 15:22.838
[woman laughs] I mean, yeah, you?
A father?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.214
That'd be disastrous.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.424
I beg your pardon.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.009
You're not the sticking-around type.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.093
No offense.

15:29.803 --> 15:30.971
Offense taken.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.973
I'd be a great father,
thank you very much.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.309
In fact, I'm about to be World's Best Dad

15:35.392 --> 15:37.436
to seven billion people. So…

15:38.020 --> 15:42.733
Hmm, well, if you wanna be a dad so bad,

15:42.816 --> 15:44.318
maybe there's still time.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.737
My divorce just finalized,

15:46.820 --> 15:49.823
and I'm ready to party like it's 1999.

15:49.907 --> 15:52.826
I-- I'm sorry,
but I'm not that same male slut

15:52.910 --> 15:55.955
that you had sex with
many, many times that night.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.456
I do stick around these days.

15:57.539 --> 16:01.168
Eliza, what are you doing?
I told you, I've evolved! [chuckles]

16:01.877 --> 16:02.795
Lucifer!

16:04.463 --> 16:06.048
You haven't changed at all.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.257
[splutters]

16:09.343 --> 16:10.177
Chloe!

16:10.260 --> 16:13.639
I can't believe you were halfway across
the country, and you didn't even tell me.

16:13.722 --> 16:16.350
-I thought you were better than this.
-Better than what?

16:16.433 --> 16:18.519
Than running off again.
What'd you marry her too?

16:18.602 --> 16:21.355
I'm just here to prove she's
not the mother of my illegitimate child.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.816
Child? What child?

16:24.566 --> 16:27.945
[sighs] Look,
a young lady broke into my penthouse,

16:28.028 --> 16:31.490
acting like the devil's spawn
and claiming to be one, to boot.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.201
-But angels can't--
-Exactly.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.661
-Except Amenadiel because--
-Right.

16:35.744 --> 16:38.914
-So the woman who came to see you…
-Is deeply confused, precisely.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.165
Hmm?

16:40.249 --> 16:43.460
-So, we're all good now, right?
-No.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.045
No, we're not all good.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.297
All this talk about being partners.

16:47.381 --> 16:50.175
-Why would you keep this from me?
-I didn't see the need to upset you.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.635
-I'm not upset.
-[glass cracks]

16:53.804 --> 16:56.348
Well, your super strength
is suggesting otherwise.

16:58.934 --> 17:02.688
Look, I am sorry. I should have told you.

17:05.315 --> 17:08.652
Just promise me, no more secrets, okay?

17:08.736 --> 17:11.280
Absolutely. I promise.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.700
[inhales] Good news is, there's
only one woman left on the list, so…

17:15.492 --> 17:16.452
What list?

17:17.202 --> 17:18.203
Uh…

17:22.082 --> 17:24.585
-Lucifer, are you still here?
-[Mazikeen] Oh, no.

17:24.668 --> 17:28.672
This is giving me, like,
generic demon bounty-hunter vibes.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.132
I wanna feel special.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.678
[sighs] Oh, Maze! Thank God.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.932
I have been looking
for someone to talk to all day.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.770
I mean, I went to visit Ella.
Of course, she couldn't see me.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.064
But I mean, you can see me, right, Maze?

17:45.147 --> 17:46.023
Maze?

17:46.815 --> 17:47.733
Maze.

17:48.901 --> 17:49.985
I don't get it.

17:50.694 --> 17:51.737
I don't get it.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.156
Dan the stupid frog can see me,
but you can't.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.868
Can somebody please,
please just tell me the rules?

17:57.951 --> 18:01.330
Mnh-mnh.
No, way less peg on the ankle, Milan.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.831
I don't wanna look like Dan.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.209
[chuckles]
Oh, yes, that would be a tragedy.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.418
Poor guy.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.337
His pants were always so tight.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.881
That's all you have to say, huh?

18:12.007 --> 18:15.302
The first time anyone
said anything about me since I got back,

18:15.385 --> 18:17.763
except to name a stupid frog after me,

18:17.846 --> 18:20.015
is to take a dump on my fashion sense?

18:20.099 --> 18:24.144
Well, you know what?
I am glad you can't see me!

18:24.228 --> 18:25.604
And another thing!

18:25.687 --> 18:31.026
Everybody knows that LA
is way too hot for leather!

18:34.071 --> 18:36.573

-[all] Mazel tov!
-[man laughs]

18:38.992 --> 18:42.371
I haven't been to a bris
since little baby Sigmund's.

18:42.454 --> 18:45.124
-Really?
-Yes, the mohel made a Freudian snip.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.667
-[chuckling]
-[baby crying]

18:46.750 --> 18:49.753
So Maze said the last person
on the list works here?

18:49.837 --> 18:52.256
Hmm. Esther Barnum. [sighs]

18:53.173 --> 18:54.133
And there she is.

18:55.801 --> 19:00.222
Well, a rabbi. I can see why you two
would have a special connection.

19:01.098 --> 19:01.974
Hmm?

19:03.183 --> 19:05.769
[chuckles] No, our special connection

19:05.853 --> 19:08.021
lasted about 15 very shallow minutes.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.815
I doubt I even made an impression.

19:09.898 --> 19:10.816
Lucifer!

19:13.152 --> 19:17.447
-Oh.
-[both laughing]

19:18.448 --> 19:23.120
I have waited 22 years
to tell you how much you changed my life.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.539
-[Chloe] Oh.
-Uh, for the worse?

19:25.622 --> 19:29.376
[chuckles] No! You left a mark on my soul.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.170
Oh.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.213
You're the reason I became a rabbi.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.133
Oh. Because I brought out
her deepest desires.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.759
[laughs] It could've happened to anyone.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.470
Yes, it's lovely to see you again, Esther.

19:40.554 --> 19:44.474
Um, if you wouldn't mind
showing us a photograph of your daughter…

19:45.392 --> 19:46.894
Not in a creepy way.

19:46.977 --> 19:47.936
…then we'll be off.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.021
Is this about Mira?

19:50.105 --> 19:52.482
-Mira?
-You heard from her? Did you find her?

19:53.150 --> 19:55.027
Um, did something happen to her?

19:56.403 --> 19:58.655
She ran away, five years ago.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.909
-I even hired a private detective.
-Hmm.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.077
This is one
of the last pictures I have of her.

20:04.661 --> 20:05.954
Oh, well, that settles it.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.498
I'll take "I am not the father"
for 200 please, Alex.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.167
You barely even looked at the photo.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.629
I don't need to, because the girl in
my penthouse had pink streaks in her hair,

20:13.712 --> 20:15.130
heavy eyeliner, angry eyebrows.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.549
-That sounds like Mira.
-It does?

20:17.633 --> 20:20.636
She was always a troubled girl.
Upset a lot.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.930
-And she always wanted to dye her hair.
-Oh.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.390
Why did Mira run away?

20:26.683 --> 20:30.979
-She was looking for her father.
-And you named me as the unlucky chap?

20:31.521 --> 20:34.900
To be honest, I don't know who her dad is.

20:35.943 --> 20:39.196
-I was a different person back then.
-Hmm. Me too.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.407
I tried to be enough for Mira, but…

20:43.325 --> 20:44.785
she wanted answers.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.913
Missing a child,

20:47.996 --> 20:51.750
it's like missing a part of yourself
that can never be replaced.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.502
[Lucifer sighing]

20:53.585 --> 20:58.006
Well, as a mother myself,
I can't imagine what you're going through.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.175
We will help you find your daughter.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.640
Oh, absolutely. Uh, your daughter…

21:06.723 --> 21:08.642
[inhales] …who definitely,

21:08.725 --> 21:11.270

22:25.385 --> 22:28.263
popping out of the bathroom mirror
or something. [chuckles]

22:29.931 --> 22:32.642
Were you just studying police procedure?
[chuckles]

22:32.726 --> 22:33.560
[Amenadiel] Yeah.

22:34.561 --> 22:37.105
Yeah, man, I made it
into the Academy, thanks to you.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.023
[Dan] What?

22:38.106 --> 22:41.401
Yeah, it meant a lot to me,
you submitting my application.

22:41.485 --> 22:44.154
-[laughs] That's great, man. That's great.
-Uh…

22:47.741 --> 22:48.700
Hey, I'm so…

22:50.035 --> 22:52.120
I'm so sorry
about getting upset with you before.

22:53.288 --> 22:56.917
You know, I've been feeling so bad about
the fight that we had right before you…

22:59.419 --> 23:00.629
Died?

23:01.338 --> 23:02.172
Yeah.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.049
Yeah, man.

23:04.132 --> 23:05.926
I've been feeling bad about that too, man.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.928
-That's why I didn't come visit you.
-Yeah, yeah.

23:08.011 --> 23:09.346
You don't have to explain.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.723
Really. It's okay.

23:11.807 --> 23:13.100
[exhales]

23:14.184 --> 23:15.769
-I love you, man.
-[chuckles]

23:18.355 --> 23:21.066
Right. You're a soul without a body.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.777
Yep, and I guess only angels can see me.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.529
[Mazikeen] What's up, Dan?

23:28.657 --> 23:31.326
Wait, what?
Wait, you can actually see me now?

23:31.410 --> 23:34.162
Yeah, I could see you all along.
Duh, it's me.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.914
[laughs] Damn it, Maze.

23:35.997 --> 23:38.500
I might've figured this out earlier
if you hadn't screwed with me.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.752

23:40.836 --> 23:42.796
-Yeah. You should know.
-[Dan chuckles]

23:43.839 --> 23:46.466
Oh, man, I'm just so happy
I can actually talk to you guys.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.344
I don't know why Lucifer
didn't bring you back, man, but it's--

23:49.428 --> 23:50.762
it's great to see you, Dan.

23:51.346 --> 23:53.181
Yeah, we really missed you, bro.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.100
Oh, man.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.519
I missed you guys too.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.230
-Hmm?
-[Mazikeen] Aah!

24:00.313 --> 24:01.606

24:01.690 --> 24:03.400
[Mazikeen] Shit. Yeah.

24:11.992 --> 24:13.243

-[chuckles]

24:13.326 --> 24:15.495
-Thank you for flying Lucifer Airways.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.622
Please ensure your table
is in the upright position.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.875

-[both laugh]

24:19.958 --> 24:22.294
Huh. Hey, Lucifer…

24:23.003 --> 24:25.964
um, have you flown anyone else before?

24:26.882 --> 24:28.133
Only Maze.

24:28.216 --> 24:30.093
Oh, and Amenadiel once.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.179
He killed a goose with his face,
Fabio-style.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.890
It was the highlight of my day. [chuckles]

24:35.474 --> 24:36.808
Oh, if it's any consolation,

24:36.892 --> 24:39.352
it's much more romantic
with you in my arms.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.147
Yeah, it's just, I've been thinking--

24:42.230 --> 24:45.066
About other things we can try in midair?
Yes, me too. [laughs]

24:45.150 --> 24:48.445
No, no, about how you've been
keeping all this from me

24:48.528 --> 24:49.863
'cause you didn't wanna upset me.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.449
That's what I said, yes.

24:52.532 --> 24:57.579
Okay, well, you know, it took you a while
to realize your feelings for me.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.790
So, maybe way deep down

25:00.874 --> 25:04.211
you know that you and Esther
have a thing together.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.339
I mean, it's looking pretty possible
that you actualized a child with her.

25:07.422 --> 25:08.965
Mira is not my daughter.

25:09.049 --> 25:13.011
Okay, but if you and Esther
did have a thing, it's totally fine.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.556
Totally okay. Not like I didn't have
any relationships before you.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.725
You know, I was-- I was married to Dan.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.894
So, just so you know,
you can tell me about it.

25:20.977 --> 25:25.273
Right. Well, there has and never will be
anything between Esther and I, okay?

25:25.357 --> 25:26.900
Okay, okay.

25:27.442 --> 25:30.195
Well, then why do I feel like
you're still keeping secrets from me?

25:30.278 --> 25:31.780
What secrets?

25:31.863 --> 25:33.490
[chuckles] You know everything.

25:33.573 --> 25:37.202
A young woman accused me of being
her father and then rage-flew away.

25:37.285 --> 25:40.413
What? She's an angel?
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

25:40.497 --> 25:43.416
[gasps] I-- I don't know.
I must have been distracted,

25:43.500 --> 25:46.461
what with the death threats
and Daniel coming back to Earth.

25:48.338 --> 25:49.172
What?

25:50.507 --> 25:51.383
Dan…

25:52.133 --> 25:53.009
is…

25:53.552 --> 25:54.678
is on Earth?

25:55.262 --> 25:57.847
[sighs] Yes, but he's a ghost

25:57.931 --> 25:59.933
so you-- you can't see him anyway.

26:02.477 --> 26:03.687
[splutters, sighs]

26:05.105 --> 26:08.149
Okay, I-- I thought we were
past the point of keeping secrets.

26:08.733 --> 26:10.944
But you clearly cannot help yourself.

26:11.027 --> 26:13.905
Why is that? I mean, I gave up everything.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.824
I gave up everything to be your partner.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.325
We are past keeping secrets.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.536
Then why wouldn't you tell me
that you have a daughter?

26:19.619 --> 26:20.620
'Cause it isn't true!

26:20.704 --> 26:23.123
I can't keep a secret
if I don't know what the secret is!

26:23.206 --> 26:24.708
But you keep keeping secrets!

26:24.791 --> 26:27.711
[exclaims, sighs]

26:27.794 --> 26:29.337

26:29.421 --> 26:32.132
Look, look, I know you're upset.

26:32.215 --> 26:36.136
But right now I think we need
to focus on why we're here, okay?

26:40.348 --> 26:42.517
Yes, let's focus on why we're here.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.602
Right.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.354
So the PI that Esther hired

26:46.438 --> 26:48.940
said that he'd heard Mira had worked here,

26:49.024 --> 26:50.275
but the trail went cold.

26:50.358 --> 26:52.068
So, let's find out why, shall we?

26:53.486 --> 26:54.821
After you.

26:57.365 --> 26:58.283

27:01.911 --> 27:05.707
Hi, there. Excuse me, sir.
Have you, um, seen this girl?

27:05.790 --> 27:06.625
No.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.087
[Chloe] Uh,
it might have been a while ago.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.130
I can't help you.

27:12.213 --> 27:15.383
Well, she's much angstier-looking now.
Uh, bits of pink in her hair.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.761
Wings, apparently. [clears throat]

27:17.844 --> 27:19.804
We're told that she used to work here.

27:19.888 --> 27:20.805
No.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.559
Uh, what about at the diner?

27:27.479 --> 27:28.313
No.

27:29.773 --> 27:33.318
Well, could she have maybe have
worked out there, at the avocado stand?

27:33.401 --> 27:35.487
No, I ran those dirty hippies out
over a year ago.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.739
Ain't seen 'em since. Good riddance.

27:38.782 --> 27:40.659
If you've run out of questions, I'm busy.

27:40.742 --> 27:42.577
Well, actually, Billy-Bob, I--

27:42.661 --> 27:45.538
No. You know, we will take one of these.

27:45.622 --> 27:47.624
And thanks so much for your time.

27:57.258 --> 28:00.095
-I was just about to mojo him.
-I didn't wanna tip him off.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.346
What are we tipping?

28:01.846 --> 28:05.016
He said that he hadn't seen anyone
from the avocado farm in a year.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.228
If that's the case,
then why is he selling this?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.231
[Lucifer] Holy guacamole.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.233
He was lying to us. It's theirs.

28:13.775 --> 28:17.612
Hide one truth,
you're probably hiding something else.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.740
Well, I wonder
what that something else is.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.576
Looks like we have some hippies to find.

28:48.393 --> 28:52.147
We, um, have a photo of her here,

No one's in trouble. Promise.
We're just worried about her.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.736
You think that Mira might
actually be your daughter, don't you?

33:52.822 --> 33:53.698
Chloe…

33:54.699 --> 33:57.285
I mean, what if she actually is?

33:57.368 --> 33:59.412
That means
I let all of this happen to her.

33:59.495 --> 34:01.622
This is not your fault, Lucifer.
You didn't know.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.832
Well, does that even matter?

34:02.915 --> 34:05.668
What matters is what you do going forward,

34:05.752 --> 34:07.003
or what we do.

34:07.754 --> 34:08.796
"We"?

34:08.880 --> 34:10.256
If you go to San Francisco

34:10.339 --> 34:13.176
and Mira is the girl
who showed up at your penthouse…

34:13.259 --> 34:15.178
if she really is your daughter,

34:16.596 --> 34:19.307
we will figure this out together, okay?

34:19.390 --> 34:20.475
As partners.

34:21.392 --> 34:23.478
[both sigh]

34:24.145 --> 34:26.689
I may not be certain of a lot right now,

34:26.773 --> 34:28.483
but one thing is for sure.

34:29.025 --> 34:32.653
I have never loved anyone
the way I love you, Chloe Decker.

34:41.662 --> 34:42.789
Go find her.

35:16.030 --> 35:17.573
Oh, bloody hell.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.036
Pervert.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.247
What are you, 72?

35:24.330 --> 35:27.875
I don't know what's going on,
but for the record, I'm 43.

35:29.001 --> 35:30.837
-Where is she?
-Hey, get out of my house!

35:30.920 --> 35:32.004
Mira!

35:32.797 --> 35:34.590
-Mira!
-[woman] Dad?

35:42.348 --> 35:44.642
You're not the girl from my penthouse.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.820
[sighs] Who are you?

35:56.404 --> 35:57.488
Not Mira's father.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.699
I am, and I'm gonna call the cops
if you don't leave.

36:01.492 --> 36:03.161
You're Mira's father?

36:03.244 --> 36:05.580
Uh, I thought
you were some basement-dweller,

36:05.663 --> 36:08.291
catfishing young ladies
on the Internet. [chuckles]

36:08.374 --> 36:10.209
[groans] Right.

36:11.252 --> 36:14.589
[exhales] I-- I owe you an apology.
Both of you.

36:14.672 --> 36:18.092
This has, uh,
been an embarrassing mistake.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.679
Uh, Mira?

36:21.762 --> 36:23.890
Call your mother. She's worried about you.

36:25.808 --> 36:27.059
She is?

36:27.143 --> 36:28.186
Hmm.

36:29.937 --> 36:32.231
I thought about contacting her
a million times,

36:32.315 --> 36:34.317
but I was so angry when I ran away.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.485
I said such awful things, I just…

36:37.820 --> 36:39.822
I didn't think she wanted to see me.

36:40.406 --> 36:42.200
She never stopped looking for you.

36:44.410 --> 36:47.496
I'll call her today. [chuckles]

36:47.580 --> 36:48.915
Right. [clears throat]

36:48.998 --> 36:52.084
Wait. How do you know my mother?

36:53.169 --> 36:57.632
Uh, there's a chance I thought I might
owe her 18 years of child support

36:57.715 --> 37:00.343
due to 15 shallow minutes
at a Super Bowl orgy.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.096
-You must be Lucifer Morningstar.
-[Lucifer] Hmm.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.891
I spent years looking into the men
who could have been my father,

37:06.974 --> 37:09.018
and you're the only one I couldn't find.

37:09.101 --> 37:10.478
Well, that's because I was in Hell.

37:10.561 --> 37:13.272
Not exactly on Google Maps, is it?
[chuckles]

37:13.856 --> 37:16.525
But I'm glad
that you found your real father.

37:17.360 --> 37:20.238
The best day of my life
when she showed up on my doorstep.

37:20.863 --> 37:24.242
Well, not at first, to be honest.
I thought I was being scammed.

37:25.326 --> 37:28.412
Well, what changed your mind?
How did you realize that she was yours?

37:30.790 --> 37:34.502
I think it was the first moment
I looked into her eyes. [exhales]

37:34.585 --> 37:37.755
-Just felt it in my gut.
