WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:07.575
( theme music playing )

01:42.236 --> 01:44.472
ON THE HEELS
OF THE SKIRMISH

01:44.572 --> 01:47.675
MAN FOOLISHLY CALLED
"THE WAR TO END ALL WARS,"

01:47.775 --> 01:51.879
THE DARK ONE SOUGHT
TO ELUDE HIS DESTINY,

01:51.979 --> 01:56.150
LIVE AS A MORTAL.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.319
SO HE FLED
ACROSS THE OCEAN,

01:58.419 --> 02:01.589
TO AN EMPIRE
CALLED AMERICA.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.592
BUT BY HIS MERE PRESENCE,

02:04.692 --> 02:10.097
A CANCER CORRUPTED
THE SPIRIT OF THE LAND.

02:10.198 --> 02:12.466
PEOPLE WERE RENDERED MUTE

02:12.566 --> 02:16.704
BY FOOLS WHO SPOKE MANY WORDS
BUT SAID NOTHING...

02:18.606 --> 02:22.876
FOR WHOM OPPRESSION
AND COWARDICE WERE VIRTUES...

02:23.844 --> 02:27.080
AND FREEDOM

02:27.181 --> 02:29.783
AN OBSCENITY.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.822
AND INTO THIS
DARK HEARTLAND,

02:34.922 --> 02:38.359
THE PROPHET
STALKED HIS ENEMY

02:38.459 --> 02:43.497
TILL, DIMINISHED
BY HIS WOUNDS,

02:43.597 --> 02:48.969
HE TURNED TO THE NEXT
IN THE ANCIENT LINE OF LIGHT.

02:49.069 --> 02:52.105
AND SO IT WAS
THAT THE FATE OF MANKIND

02:52.206 --> 02:57.077
CAME TO REST
ON THE TREMBLING SHOULDERS

02:57.177 --> 03:00.948
OF THE MOST RELUCTANT
OF SAVIORS.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.290
Justin:
AS GOD TESTED JOB,

03:09.390 --> 03:14.127
SO TOO HAVE WE BEEN TESTED,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

03:14.228 --> 03:18.366
AND AS A WHITE-HOT FLAME
TEMPERS BASE METAL

03:18.466 --> 03:20.834
INTO A FINE
BLADE OF STEEL,

03:20.934 --> 03:23.837
SO TOO
WILL WE BE FORGED.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.105
( gasps )

03:25.205 --> 03:27.308
( groans )

03:34.081 --> 03:37.851
SO, TOO,
HAVE WE BEEN FORGED

03:37.951 --> 03:41.455
BY THESE TERRIBLE TIMES.

03:42.456 --> 03:46.527
SO TOO SHALL WE RISE
LIKE A PHOENIX

03:46.627 --> 03:51.399
FROM THE ASHES
OF OUR DEGRADATION.

03:51.499 --> 03:54.001
Justin on radio:
I know many of you
have doubted.

03:54.101 --> 03:58.472
I know many of you
have doubted the truth,
the truth in my word.

03:58.572 --> 04:02.276
But those who are steadfast
and follow me

04:02.376 --> 04:06.246
will be rewarded,
not just in the next life,

04:06.347 --> 04:09.082
but here, and now.

04:09.182 --> 04:12.353
I ask only that you join me,
brothers and sisters,

04:12.453 --> 04:15.289
and together,
we will build a temple,

04:15.389 --> 04:18.359
not of stone and mortar,
but of flesh and blood

04:18.459 --> 04:21.695
and the mighty spirit
of the lord.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.368
( murmurs )
JESUS.

04:27.468 --> 04:32.740
- ( wheezing )
- ( applause over radio )

04:32.840 --> 04:36.043
( radio static )

04:36.143 --> 04:37.878
Justin:
Brothers and sisters,

04:37.978 --> 04:41.081
hear me when I say...

04:41.181 --> 04:43.317
for the greatest
commandment

04:43.417 --> 04:48.121
was not etched on a tablet
by the finger of God
at Sinai, no.

04:48.221 --> 04:50.624
It is written
in our blood.

04:50.724 --> 04:54.862
- "WRITTEN IN OUR BLOOD."
- It is carved into our flesh.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.366
It is uttered
with the last breath
of a dying warrior.

04:58.466 --> 05:02.202
"AND THAT YOU KNOW
HE IS TRUE BY HIS WORDS,

05:02.302 --> 05:04.738
THE USHER WILL DECLARE."

05:04.838 --> 05:07.608
The greatest commandment,
brothers and sisters,

05:07.708 --> 05:11.612
- is thou shalt be strong!
- "THOU SHALT BE STRONG."

05:11.712 --> 05:14.815
Yes, we have been tested.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.084
Many have failed,

05:17.184 --> 05:21.522
swallowed by the ashes
and dust,

05:21.622 --> 05:26.394
but a chosen few remain.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.215
MOVE THAT WATER!

05:48.315 --> 05:49.683
IN THE REAR!

05:49.783 --> 05:52.486
GOD DAMN IT,
KEEP IT COMING!

05:58.659 --> 06:02.396
Jones:
HELP HERE!
HELP HERE! HELP!

06:07.768 --> 06:10.438
- APOLLONIA?
SHE'S STILL IN THERE.

06:10.538 --> 06:13.607
I GOTTA--
( coughing )

06:13.707 --> 06:15.175
Sofie:
MAMA, MAMA!

06:15.275 --> 06:16.877
- MAMA!
- ( glass shatters )

06:16.977 --> 06:20.147
MAMA!
NO, LEMME GO,
GOD DAMN IT!

06:20.247 --> 06:25.018
- SHE'S GONE, SOFIE.
- NO, SHE'S NOT!
SHE'S SCREAMING!

06:25.118 --> 06:27.555
MAMA!

06:28.922 --> 06:32.292
STOP IT!
STOP IT.

06:32.392 --> 06:36.664
JUST DIE!
DIE!

06:40.400 --> 06:43.003
( heart beating )

06:57.551 --> 06:59.953
( heartbeat stops )

07:00.053 --> 07:02.523
Jones:
SOFIE!

07:26.413 --> 07:29.683
( panting )

07:32.319 --> 07:35.355
I SAW HIS EYES.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.457
YOU GAVE HIM BACK
HIS SIGHT. WHY?

07:37.558 --> 07:41.028
Management:
HE DID WHAT WAS
ASKED OF HIM.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.496
HE WAS REWARDED.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.332
HIS EYES
FOR RUTHIE'S LIFE?

07:45.432 --> 07:49.202
HIS EYES
TO FORCE YOUR HAND.

07:56.409 --> 07:59.913
SO THEN YOU TURNED AROUND
AND SOLD HIM OUT,

08:00.013 --> 08:02.583
JUST TO MAKE ME
BRING HER BACK!

08:02.683 --> 08:06.587
TO COMPEL YOU
TO FACE WHAT YOU ARE.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.256
YOU KILLED HIM!

08:10.891 --> 08:13.927
YOU KILLED HIM
WITH MY HANDS!

08:14.027 --> 08:15.896
LODZ WAS A TRAITOR.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.232
HIS LIFE MEANT
NOTHING TO ME.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.734
SAMSON WAS RIGHT
ABOUT YOU.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.137
ALL YOU DO IS
PULL STRINGS,

08:24.237 --> 08:25.873
AND MAKE PEOPLE DANCE.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.676
THERE AIN'T
BUT ONE CHOICE IN THAT.

08:28.776 --> 08:31.278
DON'T BE A FOOL,
BOY.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.946
I DON'T AIM TO BE.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.682
NOT THIS TIME.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.685
I'M GONNA TURN MYSELF
OVER TO THE OTHERS.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.587
THEY'LL MAKE ME PAY.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.255
AND GIMME MORE OF A CHOICE
THAN I GOT WITH YOU.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.157
NO!

08:45.258 --> 08:47.661
( rhythmic beeping )

08:55.202 --> 08:57.170
( alarm sounds )

08:57.270 --> 08:59.206
( air-raid siren blares )

08:59.306 --> 09:01.108
( explosion )

09:28.869 --> 09:31.271
Justin:
YE OFFSPRING OF SERPENTS,

09:31.371 --> 09:36.209
WHO WARNED YOU TO FLEE
FROM THE WRATH TO COME?

09:38.045 --> 09:39.980
WE GOT A FIRE--

09:40.080 --> 09:41.949
HAWKINS?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.225
WHAT'VE YOU DONE?

09:52.325 --> 09:54.728
Management:
GET OUT!

10:00.300 --> 10:01.902
NOW YOU SEE WHY

10:02.002 --> 10:05.472
I CANNOT
ALLOW YOU TO THROW
YOUR LIFE AWAY?

10:05.572 --> 10:09.042
THAT THING...

10:09.142 --> 10:10.510
WHAT WAS IT?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.112
A WEAPON.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.615
A FALSE SUN WROUGHT
BY THE HANDS OF MEN.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.585
IT IS THE LAST LINK
IN A CHAIN OF EVENTS

10:18.686 --> 10:20.587
UNFOLDING
EVEN AS WE SPEAK.

10:20.688 --> 10:23.056
YOU MUST BREAK
THAT CHAIN.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.358
HOW THE HELL AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.095
BY DESTROYING THE PREACHER
YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR DREAMS.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.031
FIND SCUDDER
AND BRING HIM TO ME.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.900
WHAT DOES HE HAVE
TO DO WITH THIS?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.937
HE WAS TO ME
WHAT THE PREACHER
IS TO YOU.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.605
MY ENEMY.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.842
YOU SAW MY FAILURE
IN THE WAR.

10:42.575 --> 10:45.045
YOU'RE THE RUSSIAN?

10:46.747 --> 10:49.149
- ( anim growling )
- ( screaming )

10:51.518 --> 10:52.753
( speaking in Russian )

10:52.853 --> 10:55.723
YES, MY NAME IS
LUCIUS BELYAKOV.

10:55.823 --> 10:59.026
SCUDDER KNOWS
THE TRUE NAME
OF THE PREACHER

10:59.126 --> 11:01.461
AS I KNEW YOURS,
BEN HAWKINS.

11:01.561 --> 11:03.296
YOU MUST BRING HIM
TO ME!

11:03.396 --> 11:05.866
I'VE ALREADY BLOODIED
MY HANDS ONCE FOR YOU.

11:05.966 --> 11:09.569
I AIN'T GONNA DO IT AGAIN.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.172
- ( door slams )
- YOU CAN'T RUN FROM THIS!

11:12.272 --> 11:13.540
I AIN'T GONNA DO IT.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.743
( rumbling )

11:15.843 --> 11:18.645
MILLIONS WILL DIE!

11:18.746 --> 11:21.214
I CAN'T STOP THAT!
I'M JUST ONE MAN!

11:21.882 --> 11:24.184
THEN RUN, COWARD!

11:24.284 --> 11:26.586
RUN AS YOUR FATHER DID
BEFORE YOU!

11:26.686 --> 11:29.790
I'M NOT HIM,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

11:32.659 --> 11:35.763
IF YOU TRY TO ESCAPE
YOUR DESTINY,

11:35.863 --> 11:39.466
THE WORLD WILL NOT ESCAPE
ITS TERRIBLE FATE!

12:03.323 --> 12:05.092
( thunder crashes )

12:45.265 --> 12:48.101
Justin's voice:
HE IS THE USHER.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.771
( radio music playing )

14:31.939 --> 14:34.141
( knocks )

15:05.905 --> 15:08.775
Jones:
HE WASN'T IN THERE.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.743
ARE YOU SURE?

15:10.843 --> 15:14.581
THERE WAS
BUT THREE OF US...

15:14.681 --> 15:18.318
AND TWO COME OUT.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.488
WHAT'S LEFT OF THE THIRD'S
UNDER THAT TARP.

15:29.997 --> 15:33.666
IT AIN'T HIM, LILA.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.102
HE'LL BE BACK.

15:35.202 --> 15:38.405
SAFE AND SOUND,
YOU'LL SEE.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.977
Management:
THE POLICEMAN WILL RETURN.

15:44.077 --> 15:49.382
WHEN HE DOES,
YOU WILL TELL HIM THE BOY
PERISHED IN THE FIRE.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.018
HE'LL WANT PROOF.

15:51.118 --> 15:54.554
YOU WILL GIVE THEM THE BONES
OF THE FORTUNE-TELLER.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.389
I CAN'T DO THAT.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.826
YOU WILL DO THAT
AND WHATEVER ELSE
IS NECESSARY.

15:59.926 --> 16:03.596
THE BOY IS STRONG,
BUT FAR FROM READY,

16:03.696 --> 16:05.032
AND TIME RUNS SHORT.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.700
YOU MUST SEE THAT HE
COMES TO NO HARM.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.003
I'LL DO WHAT I CAN.

16:10.103 --> 16:13.806
YOU WILL BE MY VOICE
WHEN I WISH TO SPEAK TO HIM,

16:13.906 --> 16:16.709
MY EARS WHEN HE CHOOSES
TO SPEAK TO ME.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.878
WE TRIED THAT BEFORE.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.580
LISTEN TO ME, SAMSON,

16:20.680 --> 16:23.983
THE BOY MUST NOT SET FOOT
IN THIS TRAILER AGAIN,

16:24.084 --> 16:26.719
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:26.819 --> 16:30.657
HE... TEMPTSE.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.733
( coyote barks )

17:38.991 --> 17:42.762
SOMEONE PICKS
A NUMBER FOR THIS,
IT'S GONNA BE ME.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.498
THAT AIN'T RIGHT.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.833
NO, IT AIN'T.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.336
IT JUST IS.

17:49.436 --> 17:53.806
AND IN MANAGEMENT'S BOOK,
THAT'S THE ONLY THING
THAT COUNTS.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.409
THINGS LIKE
RIGHT AND WRONG.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.252
IT AIN'T EVEN DECENT
SHOW-BETS.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.865
( raspy breathing )

18:27.274 --> 18:30.143
Justin:
HOW IS HE?

18:30.243 --> 18:32.612
( sighs )
WE ALMOST LOST HIM.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.647
DEAR LORD.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.915
A STROKE.

18:36.015 --> 18:37.684
I WAS RIGHT THERE.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.687
Iris:
THANK GOD FOR THAT.
WHAT IF HE'D BEEN ALONE?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.021
NORMAN?

18:42.121 --> 18:43.590
CAN HE HEAR US?

18:43.690 --> 18:47.794
IT'S HARD TO TELL.
HE CAN'T SPEAK.

18:50.697 --> 18:54.066
IRIS, WOULD YOU MIND
STEPPING OUT FOR
A FEW MOMENTS?

18:54.167 --> 18:56.703
I NEED TO SPEAK
TO YOUR BROTHER.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.879
I RECEIVED THIS
FROM NORMAN YESTERDAY.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.282
( grunts )

19:09.382 --> 19:11.484
IT SEEMS HE WAS
CONVINCED THAT

19:11.584 --> 19:14.354
YOU WERE POSSESSED
BY SOME SORT OF DEMON.

19:16.423 --> 19:19.259
( soft whimpering )

19:19.892 --> 19:22.895
MY GOD, NORMAN.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.633
I SHOULD'VE SEEN THIS
COMING.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.202
AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS
OF HIM TAKING CARE OF US,

19:29.302 --> 19:31.604
NOW I FAILED HIM.

19:31.704 --> 19:36.175
NO, IF ANYONE IS
TO BLAME, IT IS ME.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.077
THIS LETTER--

19:38.177 --> 19:40.146
I SHOULD'VE SEEN HIM
IMMEDIATELY.

19:40.247 --> 19:43.450
I COULD'VE ORDERED
AN EVALUATION.

19:46.118 --> 19:49.756
CALL ME IF HIS
CONDITION CHANGES.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.844
NORMAN,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:14.747 --> 20:16.115
YES.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.919
YES, YOU CAN.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.589
I CAN SEE IT
IN YOUR EYES.

20:24.991 --> 20:27.527
LOOK, I AM
SO SORRY, NORMAN.

20:27.627 --> 20:31.531
IT NEVER SHOULD'VE
COME TO THIS.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.434
NEVER.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.405
THAT'S HAWKINS,

20:38.505 --> 20:40.473
WHAT'S LEFT OF HIM.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.711
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:44.811 --> 20:47.079
SONOFABITCH TURNED UP
LAST NIGHT.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.416
HAD MY BOYS
RUN HIM DOWN.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.484
HID OUT IN THE BUS.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.986
MUST'VE KICKED OVER
A LAMP OR SOMETHING.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.023
HELL OF A BLAZE.

20:58.124 --> 21:00.393
IS THAT THE WAY IT WENT?

21:04.163 --> 21:06.499
YEAH.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.701
( spits )

21:10.937 --> 21:13.272
Jones:
THAT WAS
PRETTY GODDAMN LOW.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.108
I'VE DONE WORSE.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.944
SHE'S ONE OF US,
DAMN IT.

21:18.044 --> 21:22.349
SHE DESERVES MORE
THAN SOME UNMARKED HOLE
IN A POTTER'S FIELD.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.954
WHAT'RE YOU
GONNA TELL SOFIE?

21:28.054 --> 21:30.189
WHAT AM I GONNA
TELL SOFIE?

21:30.289 --> 21:35.928
PPROBABLY A BIG GODDAMN E
WITH BELLS ON IT.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.499
RIGHT, JONESY?

22:02.455 --> 22:05.425
Ruthie:
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

22:24.143 --> 22:26.446
GABE TOLD ME

22:31.083 --> 22:33.352

22:33.453 --> 22:35.855
WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?

22:35.955 --> 22:39.726

22:39.826 --> 22:43.730

TILL THE POISON BROKE.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.000
I JUST--

22:50.302 --> 22:53.706
I COULDN'T STAND
SEEING YOU LIKE THAT.

22:57.644 --> 22:59.546
I HEARD YOU CALLING ME
FROM--

22:59.646 --> 23:02.415
FROM REAL FAR AWAY.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.785
IT WAS YOU.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.722
YOUR VOICE
BROUGHT ME BACK.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.668
BEN?

23:21.768 --> 23:25.304
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
THINKING YOU OWE ME

23:25.404 --> 23:27.907
THAT'S ALL.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.853
SHE STILL
SLEEPING?

23:40.953 --> 23:45.925
POOR THING.
GOD KNOWS WHAT SHE'S

23:47.026 --> 23:48.661

23:48.761 --> 23:51.330

23:54.701 --> 23:56.302
RESPECT FOR THE DEAD

23:56.402 --> 23:58.304
'COURSE SHE WAS HALF-DEAD
TO START WITH.

23:58.404 --> 24:00.840
- OH...
- ( snorts, chuckles )

24:00.940 --> 24:03.009
THAT AIN'T FUNNY.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.877
SAMSON'S RIGHT.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.847
IT'S A TOUGH CALL,
BUT WE SURE COULD USE
THE SCRATCH.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.883
AND BESIDES,
THE BEANERS ARE RIPE
FOR ANOTHER SQUEEZE OR TWO.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.553
IF I DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER,
FELIX DREIFUSS,

24:13.653 --> 24:17.389
I'D THINK MAYBE YOU'RE
TAKING A RENEWED INTEREST
IN OUR LITTLE ENTERPRISE.

24:17.490 --> 24:20.827
NOTHING WRONG WITH MAKING
A LITTLE MONEY.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.523
JONESY?

24:59.231 --> 25:01.801
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR MA.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.905

25:15.648 --> 25:18.150
YOU DIDN'T WHAT?

25:19.385 --> 25:21.120
I'M SORRY.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.256
WELL THEN,
I GUESS THAT MAKES IT
ALL BETTER, DON'T IT?

25:24.356 --> 25:26.158
- PLEASE BELIEVE ME.
- I DO.

25:26.258 --> 25:28.895
GOD KNOWS I DO.

25:29.896 --> 25:33.032
THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT SO AWFUL.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.368
I'M SORRY,
YOU'RE SORRY,

25:36.468 --> 25:37.970
THE WHOLE WORLD'S

25:38.070 --> 25:43.042
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DON'T MEAN
A GODDAMN THING.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.082
YOU SEE ME AROUND...

25:51.784 --> 25:54.954
YOU JUST WALK
THE OTHER WAY.

26:12.705 --> 26:15.942
FRANKLY, IT DOESN'T
SURPRISE ME AT ALL.

26:16.042 --> 26:19.779
HE JUST HASN'T
BEEN THE SAME SINCE
CLARA PASSED ON.

26:27.186 --> 26:29.321

26:29.421 --> 26:32.291
- PULL OVER, NOW.

26:44.536 --> 26:46.172
JUSTIN?

26:46.272 --> 26:48.975
JUSTIN,
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.860
( softly )
YOU BURN WITH LUST
AMONG THE OAKS

27:07.960 --> 27:09.929
AND UNDER
EVERY SPREADING TREE.

27:10.029 --> 27:13.399
YOU SACRIFICE YOUR CHILDREN
IN THE RAVINES

27:13.499 --> 27:16.402
AND UNDER
THE HANGING CRAGS.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.027
IRIS!

27:55.641 --> 27:57.877
THIS WILL BE
MY NEW CANAAN.

27:57.977 --> 28:02.381

28:10.356 --> 28:13.592
Iris:
WE WILL BUILD
A TEMPLE, ALEXSEI.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.328
WE WILL BUILD IT
TOGETHER.

28:23.836 --> 28:27.006
( kids cheering )

28:28.908 --> 28:31.510
Barker:

28:31.610 --> 28:33.579

SHE'S RIGHT INSIDE!

28:33.679 --> 28:36.082
THANK YOU, MA'AM,

29:09.615 --> 29:11.918

29:12.018 --> 29:16.255
- THE PROFESSOR.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.796
Lila:
NOBODY'S SEEN HIM
SINCE LAST NIGHT.

29:23.896 --> 29:26.532
- HE'LL TURN UP.
- I THINK SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED.

29:26.632 --> 29:28.835
I GOTTA REAL BAD
FEELING ABOUT THIS.

29:28.935 --> 29:31.203
CAN YOU ASK
MANAGEMENT?

29:31.303 --> 29:33.772
ASK HIM WHAT?

29:33.873 --> 29:35.207

29:35.307 --> 29:37.109
HE'S PROBABLY
SLEEPING OFF A BELLYFUL

29:37.209 --> 29:40.212

29:40.312 --> 29:43.249
Kid:

29:43.349 --> 29:47.519

29:51.390 --> 29:53.559
I'LL ASK HIM.

29:53.659 --> 29:56.028

31:15.474 --> 31:18.244

31:18.344 --> 31:19.778
HEARST?

31:19.878 --> 31:22.681

31:22.781 --> 31:24.516
WILLIAM RANDOLPH

31:24.616 --> 31:26.318

31:30.122 --> 31:32.624
Iris:
EXCUSE ME.

31:36.095 --> 31:39.065
WE NEED TO SPEAK

31:48.407 --> 31:50.276
THAT'S RIGHT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

31:50.376 --> 31:52.411
10 BIG ACTS

31:52.511 --> 31:55.847
SEE THE AMAZING
RONDO THE REGURGITATOR,

31:55.948 --> 31:58.384

AND OTHER AMAZING
FREAKS OF NATURE.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.490
STEP RIGHT UP.
NEVER BEFORE HAVE
WE ASSEMBLED...

32:04.590 --> 32:07.726
Samson:
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

32:07.826 --> 32:10.096
ALL I KNOW IS
I AIN'T NEVER
SEEN HIM LIKE THIS.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.631
WHATEVER HE
WANTS YOU TO DO,
YOU'D BETTER DO IT.

32:12.731 --> 32:16.868
I MADE UP MY MIND.
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM
FACE TO FACE.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.038
NO CAN DO.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.740
KID, IT'S
MANAGEMENT'S ORDERS.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.976
YOU GONNA HAVE TO
GO THROUGH ME.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.712
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.647
LISTEN TO YOUR BLOOD.

32:28.747 --> 32:33.052
MY BLOOD?
WHAT THE HELL'S
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

32:34.086 --> 32:37.089
I'M JUST
THE MESSENGER, KID.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.255
Justin:
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME, TOMMY,

33:09.355 --> 33:11.090
BUT I DON'T SEE WHAT
THIS HAS TO DO WITH US.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.192
Tommy:
YOUR CAR WAS SEEN
LEAVING 10 MINUTES

33:13.292 --> 33:15.227
- BEFORE THE FIRE.
- A BLACK MODEL-A WAS SEEN.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.264
- A BLACK MODEL-A SEDAN.
- THERE MUST BE THOUSANDS
OF THEM.

33:18.364 --> 33:21.233
YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT ONLY 29 REGISTERED
IN SAN BENITO COUNTY,

33:21.333 --> 33:24.670
- AND FOUR IN MINTERN PROPER.
- YOU'RE NOT SUGGESTING--

33:24.770 --> 33:26.772
NO, BUT SOMEONE ELSE
IS BOUND TO.

33:26.872 --> 33:28.740
YOU'RE A MAN OF GOD,
JUSTIN.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.044
FOLKS HOLD THEIR PROPHETS
TO PRETTY HIGH STANDARDS.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.513
EVEN IN CALIFORNIA.

33:36.748 --> 33:39.151
( sighs )

33:40.752 --> 33:43.422
I WANT YOU TO CONDUCT
A FULL INVESTIGATION.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.725
SEE TO IT THAT WHOEVER
MURDERED THOSE CHILDREN

33:46.825 --> 33:48.194
PAYS FOR WHAT THEY DID.

33:48.294 --> 33:50.762
WHAT IF IT'S SOMEONE
ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR MINISTRY?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.998
THEN IT IS
ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT

33:53.099 --> 33:55.834
THAT WE BE THE ONES
TO BRING THEM
TO THE POLICE.

33:55.934 --> 33:59.271
THERE YOU ARE.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.541
TOMMY AND I WERE
JUST GOING OVER
MY SCHEDULE.

34:02.641 --> 34:04.676
OH, I SEE.

34:04.776 --> 34:06.478
MR. DOLAN...

34:06.578 --> 34:09.148
WILL YOU BE STAYING
FOR DINNER?

34:09.248 --> 34:12.951
NO, I'M AFRAID NOT.
WE'VE GOT A TRAIN TO CATCH.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.421
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.198
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

34:29.335 --> 34:31.470
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY WARM COAT?

34:31.570 --> 34:35.841
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
YOUR COAT IS.

35:19.685 --> 35:21.887
DAMN IT.

35:28.894 --> 35:31.263
SOFIE?

35:33.165 --> 35:36.134
SOFIE, IT'S ME.

35:48.547 --> 35:52.184
Announcer:
Oh! Flynn launches
a punishing combination.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.819
C'MON, PADDY!
PUT HIM DOWN!

35:53.919 --> 35:56.655
And a haymaker left flies wild
over Kaspar's shoulder!

35:56.755 --> 36:00.025
K.O. steps inside, comes back
with a walloping right,

36:00.125 --> 36:01.693
a left,
a jab to the mid-section.

36:01.793 --> 36:05.931
- YOU SEEN SOFIE AROUND?
- UH, NOT SINCE THIS MORNING.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.334
MAYBE I BETTER TALK
TO SAMSON.

36:08.434 --> 36:11.270
- YEAH, YOU BEST.
- YOU SURE YOU AIN'T
SEEN HER AROUND?

36:11.370 --> 36:14.406
NO, NO,
YOU BETTER RUN OVER,
TELL SAMSON QUICK.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.777
I HATE TO GET EVERYBODY
ALL WORKED UP OVER NOTHING.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.145
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?

36:20.246 --> 36:22.614
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.
THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY.

36:22.714 --> 36:26.218
GIRL'S LIABLE
TO THROW HERSELF OFF
A BRIDGE OR WORSE!

36:30.522 --> 36:33.692
...and it wasn't a fight,
folks, it was a slaughter.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.462
One, two, three rounds
and it's bye-bye Irish
Paddy Flynn,

36:36.562 --> 36:38.497
flat on the canvas
and out like a light!

36:38.597 --> 36:42.868
GOD DAMN YOU LOUSY
SPUD-PICKIN' MICK BASTARD!
( groans )

37:14.966 --> 37:17.603
( glass shatters )

37:50.569 --> 37:52.704
* Scandals,
they're everywhere *

37:52.804 --> 37:55.641
* They're in the air
and who put them there? *

37:55.741 --> 38:00.379
* You, you, and you,
you nasty man... *

38:02.080 --> 38:03.982
( voices approaching )

38:04.082 --> 38:08.086
I'M THINKING
YOUR MEMOIRS WOULD MAKE
A GREAT SERIALIZATION.

38:08.186 --> 38:10.489
BROTHER JUSTIN,
COULD I HAVE A WORD?

38:10.589 --> 38:12.458
SORRY, PAL.
WE GOT A BROADCAST.

38:12.558 --> 38:15.160
I'M HERE
FOR THE USHER!

38:15.260 --> 38:17.696
WHAT?

38:17.796 --> 38:20.065
THE USHER.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.200
WAIT FOR ME INSIDE.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.803
- JUSTIN--
- GO.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.218
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

38:40.318 --> 38:42.320
IT'S SUCH AN HONOR.

38:42.421 --> 38:45.791
I HEARD YOU
ON THE RADIO.

38:45.891 --> 38:49.561
MY NAME'S
WILFRED TALBOT SMITH.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.800
( groans )

38:56.935 --> 38:58.169
I'M-- I'M SORRY.

38:58.269 --> 39:00.672
I MUST'VE BEEN
MISTAKEN--

39:04.042 --> 39:06.545
NO.
YOU'RE NOT.

39:06.645 --> 39:09.915
BUT YOU BLEED
LIKE A MAN.

39:10.015 --> 39:11.550
WHAT?!

39:11.650 --> 39:14.520
- HE'S STILL ALIVE.
- WHO?

39:14.620 --> 39:16.622
WHO IS STILL ALIVE?
TELL ME!

39:16.722 --> 39:20.726
BY THE HAND OF THE PRINCE,
THE PROPHET DIES.

39:20.826 --> 39:22.628
UPON HIS DEATH,
THE PRINCE SHALL RISE.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.963
STOP BABBLING
AND TELL ME WHO!

39:25.063 --> 39:27.499
THE GOSPEL OF MATTHIAS.

39:27.599 --> 39:31.570
CHAPTER 3,
VERSES 26-28.

39:31.670 --> 39:33.439
YOU HAVE TO KILL HIM.

39:33.539 --> 39:36.074
YOU HAVE TO KILL HIM
WITH YOUR OWN HANDS.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.944
- WHO?
- SCUDDER!

39:39.044 --> 39:40.879
HENRY SCUDDER.

39:40.979 --> 39:44.683
AND THEN WHAT?

39:45.383 --> 39:47.185
YOU'LL BE THE PROPHET.

39:47.285 --> 39:49.588
THE USHER.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.799
HENRY SCUDDER.

40:17.816 --> 40:22.654
KILL HIM
AND YOU WILL RECEIVE
THE DIVINE BLOOD.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.193
RUN.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.904
AW, DAMN IT.

41:31.222 --> 41:33.725
( rustling )

42:00.251 --> 42:01.987
( phone jangles )

42:04.122 --> 42:05.423
WHERE'S SCUDDER?

42:05.523 --> 42:07.959
- WHERE!?
- I TOLD YOU, GOD DAMN IT!

42:08.059 --> 42:09.928
I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
NAMED SCUDDER!

42:10.028 --> 42:12.898
- THAT'S WHAT
YOUR MOUTH SAID.
- CHRIST ALMIGHTY, BOY.

42:12.998 --> 42:16.167
WHAT THE HELL'S YOUR TRUCK
WITH HIM ANYWAY?

42:16.267 --> 42:17.636
HE'S MY FATHER.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.738
Woman's voice:
Operator speaking.

42:19.838 --> 42:21.707
Do you wish
to make a call?
Hello?

42:21.807 --> 42:25.176
SEND THE POLICE DOWN
TO THE TEMPLAR HALL!

42:27.813 --> 42:29.848
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
WHERE IS HE?

42:29.948 --> 42:31.950
- HE'LL KILL ME.
- IF I WAS YOU,

42:32.050 --> 42:35.320
- I WOULDN'T BE WORRYING
ABOUT HIM RIGHT NOW!
- ALL RIGHT!

42:36.822 --> 42:39.925
THEY SHOWED UP ONE DAY,
HIM AND ANOTHER FELLOW.

42:40.025 --> 42:41.893
WHEN?

42:41.993 --> 42:44.562
- WHEN?!
- 10, 12 YEARS AGO!

42:44.663 --> 42:47.198
WHAT HAPPENED?

42:47.298 --> 42:50.936
SCUDDER, HE GOT
REAL COZY WITH OUR
CHAPLAIN KERRIGAN.

42:51.036 --> 42:54.372
AND HE STOLE SOME BOOKS
OUT OF OUR LIBRARY.

42:54.472 --> 42:56.474
WHAT KIND OF BOOKS?

42:56.574 --> 42:59.010
HOLY BOOKS-- GOSPELS.
AND THEN THEY LIT OUT.

42:59.110 --> 43:01.046
I HAVEN'T SEEN
EITHER ONE OF THEM
SINCE.

43:01.146 --> 43:03.649
I SWEAR TO GOD
I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

43:03.749 --> 43:06.217
PLEASE, KID,

43:06.317 --> 43:08.153
IF YOU FIND SCUDDER,

43:08.253 --> 43:09.821
FOR GOD'S SAKES--

43:09.921 --> 43:13.591
( sobs )
DON'T TELL HIM
YOU TALKED TO ME.

43:13.692 --> 43:16.628
DON'T TELL HIM
I TOLD YOU NOTHING.

43:16.728 --> 43:20.498
HE AIN'T HUMAN.
HE AIN'T HUMAN!

43:20.598 --> 43:23.802
I AIN'T EITHER.

43:45.423 --> 43:48.894
WHAT HAPPENED
TO KERRIGAN?

43:48.994 --> 43:53.665
HE WENT MAD.
HE LOST HIS MIND.

43:53.765 --> 43:56.267
THE ARCHDIOCESE LOCKED HIM UP
IN A SQUIRREL PEN

43:56.367 --> 43:58.203
UP OUTSIDE ALAMOGORDO.

43:58.303 --> 44:01.072
THAT'S ALL
I KNOW.

44:05.143 --> 44:08.346
Samson:
ALL RIGHT, WE GOT SIX VEHICLES
THAT AIN'T TRUCKS.

44:08.446 --> 44:10.415
I WANT ALL OF THEM
ROLLING.

44:10.515 --> 44:13.218
SLIM, OSGOOD, BURLEY,

44:13.318 --> 44:15.120
SEE IF SHE'S IN TOWN.

44:15.220 --> 44:17.823
THE REST OF YOU GO CHECK
OUT ON THE ROADS.

44:17.923 --> 44:20.058
WE AIN'T LEAVING HERE
WITHOUT HER.

44:20.158 --> 44:25.096
- THAT'S THE CODE.
- Lila: WHAT ABOUT LODZ?

44:25.196 --> 44:27.065
UH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I WAS JUST GETTING TO THAT.

44:27.165 --> 44:32.203
KEEP AN EYE PEELED
FOR THE PROFESSOR.
HE'S GONE MISSING TOO.

44:32.303 --> 44:35.573
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,
A WRITTEN INVITATION?
GET!

44:35.673 --> 44:38.309
Man:
ALL RIGHT, ARNIE,
YOU GUYS, FOLLOW ME.

44:45.250 --> 44:47.719
( trucks starting,
leaving )

44:47.819 --> 44:50.155
Justin:
GOOD EVENING,
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

44:50.255 --> 44:52.724
AND WELCOME TO
THE CHURCH OF THE AIR.

44:52.824 --> 44:54.826
I AM BROTHER JUSTIN,

44:54.926 --> 44:58.396
AND THOUGH I AM ALONE
IN THIS STUDIO,

44:58.496 --> 45:02.000
I CAN SENSE
YOUR PRESENCE.

45:02.100 --> 45:06.537
YOU ARE WITH ME,
AND I AM WITH YOU.

45:06.637 --> 45:09.775
LIKE YOU,
I GREW UP IN AN AMERICA

45:09.875 --> 45:12.710
FAR DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE
IN WHICH WE LIVE TODAY.

45:12.811 --> 45:15.213
THERE ARE THOSE
THAT WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE

45:15.313 --> 45:20.718
THAT THE AMERICA
THAT WE REMEMBER
NO LONGER EXISTS.

45:20.819 --> 45:22.587
Perhaps they are right.

45:22.687 --> 45:25.891
MANY OF US ARE
COLD AND HUNGRY...

45:25.991 --> 45:27.959
- THAT'S ODD.
- Tommy: WHAT?

45:28.059 --> 45:31.662
THIS TRANSMITTER'S RATED
FOR ONLY 5,000 WATTS.

45:31.763 --> 45:35.633
- YEAH, SO?
- WE'RE KNOCKING OUT 10.

45:35.733 --> 45:40.305
HOW DID THIS SHROUD
OF POVERTY SUDDENLY SMOTHER
THIS ONCE GREAT LAND?

45:40.405 --> 45:44.709
But the America
for which our forefathers
fought and died,

45:44.810 --> 45:46.577
brothers and sisters,
is not lost.

45:46.677 --> 45:50.648
No, it has not been consigned
to the dust heap of history.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.683
It is not forgotten.

45:52.784 --> 45:57.655
- No, this land--
- ( Justin's voice whispers )
Varlyn Stroud.

45:57.755 --> 46:04.229
- your land has been stolen
by the international bankers,
- Varlyn Stroud.

46:04.329 --> 46:06.832
stolen by
the crooked politicians,

46:06.932 --> 46:09.801
stolen by cheap,
immigrant labor...

46:09.901 --> 46:12.203
STEP BACK
FROM THE LINE.

46:12.303 --> 46:16.141
( whispers )
You will be my apostle.

46:18.309 --> 46:19.845
Guard: STROUD!

46:19.945 --> 46:23.448
STEP BACK BEHIND THE LINE.

46:23.548 --> 46:27.018
Justin:
Who is there to protect
your American dream?

46:27.118 --> 46:29.821
I say unto you
there is only one,

46:29.921 --> 46:32.223
and that is yourself.

46:32.323 --> 46:35.193
You must take back
what is yours.

46:35.293 --> 46:39.297
We, as a nation, must recover
our collective dre,

46:39.397 --> 46:41.933
the dream
of our forefathers.

46:42.033 --> 46:44.569
( whispers )
My archangel.

48:50.928 --> 48:53.031
( groans )

49:10.681 --> 49:14.652
Justin's voice:
WHO ARE YOU?

49:43.014 --> 49:46.517
( theme music playing )
