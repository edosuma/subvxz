00:01.219 --> 00:03.161
<i>Previously on</i> Mike & Molly...

00:03.162 --> 00:04.762
Oh, I got in.

00:04.764 --> 00:06.798
Well, what is going
on with you?

00:06.800 --> 00:08.100
The Iowa Writers Workshop.

00:08.101 --> 00:10.068
I've been accepted into
their summer writing program.

00:10.069 --> 00:11.202
Wait a minute.

00:11.204 --> 00:14.071
Are you actually good
at this writing thing?

00:14.073 --> 00:16.375
I'll be living my dream
in Iowa for eight weeks.

00:16.376 --> 00:18.710
How are you gonna ruin that,
Peggy?

00:18.711 --> 00:19.911
Eight weeks?

00:19.913 --> 00:21.280
Does Mike know
about all this?

00:21.281 --> 00:23.681
Damn it, you always find a way.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.684
I have some exciting news.

00:26.686 --> 00:28.053
More for her than you.

00:28.054 --> 00:29.520
Shh!

00:29.522 --> 00:31.255
What is going on?

00:31.257 --> 00:33.759
I've been accepted into one
of the most prestigious

00:33.760 --> 00:35.593
writing programs in the country.

00:35.595 --> 00:37.062
Honey, that's great!

00:37.063 --> 00:39.230
In Iowa.

00:42.067 --> 00:43.568
It's an opportunity
of a lifetime.

00:43.569 --> 00:44.703
Well, I'm sure it is.

00:44.704 --> 00:46.605
I can't believe
you did this whole deal

00:46.606 --> 00:48.206
without even talking
to me about it.

00:48.207 --> 00:49.741
Well, we're talking
about it now.

00:49.742 --> 00:50.909
No, you're telling me.

00:50.910 --> 00:52.010
Talking about it would be,

00:52.011 --> 00:53.244
"Honey, I'm thinking
about applying

00:53.245 --> 00:54.813
"for an out-of-state workshop
for a couple months.

00:54.814 --> 00:55.980
You okay with that?"

00:55.982 --> 00:58.215
Are you okay with that?

00:59.250 --> 01:01.452
Why didn't you tell me?

01:02.721 --> 01:05.657
Just figured
I was never gonna get in.

01:05.658 --> 01:08.859
I was too embarrassed
to even talk about it.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.464
Lady, you have no idea

01:12.465 --> 01:14.465
how great you are.

01:14.467 --> 01:17.869
Smart and talented.

01:17.870 --> 01:23.508
Huh? And you can do anything
that you set that mind to.

01:23.509 --> 01:25.676
Thank you.

01:26.844 --> 01:29.681
I'm sorry I'm leaving you here
with the lunatics.

01:29.682 --> 01:31.482
The Taser's working, right?

01:31.483 --> 01:33.383
(laughing)
Yeah.

01:44.462 --> 01:47.931
How long has Fido been waiting
for his master?

01:47.933 --> 01:49.033
About an hour.

01:49.034 --> 01:50.301
Ever since Molly called
from Naperville

01:50.302 --> 01:51.601
when she
stopped for gas.

01:51.603 --> 01:54.237
He got so excited,
I'm surprised he hasn't piddled.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.139
(car horn honks)
What's that, boy?

01:56.141 --> 01:57.808
You hear something?

01:57.809 --> 01:58.976
Leave him alone.

01:58.977 --> 02:00.911
This is the first
time I've seen him

02:00.912 --> 02:02.680
on his hind legs
since she left.

02:02.681 --> 02:03.781
Poor thing.

02:03.782 --> 02:06.182
He's been real sad without Molly.
Mm.

02:06.184 --> 02:07.651
Celibacy will do that
to a man.

02:07.652 --> 02:09.320
That's why monks
are so quiet.

02:09.321 --> 02:11.955
If you're not getting any,
what's there to talk about?

02:13.090 --> 02:16.292
He must have been a mute
before he met Molly.

02:16.294 --> 02:17.661
Oh, there were girls.

02:17.662 --> 02:20.064
I mean, he'd lose a few pounds,
get his heart broken,

02:20.065 --> 02:24.701
then come crawling back into
the arms of his best gal.

02:24.703 --> 02:26.637
The fact that his fridge
isn't full

02:26.638 --> 02:28.572
of women's heads is a miracle.

02:28.573 --> 02:31.140
She's here! She's here!

02:34.178 --> 02:37.047
There she is!

02:37.048 --> 02:40.216
Oh, my God,
I missed you all so much!

02:40.218 --> 02:41.652
Oh, not as much
as I missed you,

02:41.653 --> 02:42.952
because I have been here
with them.

02:42.954 --> 02:44.321
All right,

02:44.322 --> 02:45.888
leave some for
the rest of us.

02:45.890 --> 02:47.590
I missed this face.

02:47.592 --> 02:48.658
Oh.

02:48.660 --> 02:50.693
It felt like
you were gone for months.

02:50.695 --> 02:52.496
Yeah, I... I actually was.

02:52.497 --> 02:54.164
Oh, come here.
Come here.

02:54.165 --> 02:55.264
VINCE:
Clear the way.

02:55.266 --> 02:56.567
Step-papa coming through. Oh!

02:56.568 --> 02:59.101
All right, all right.

02:59.103 --> 03:01.271
How great does this feel?
I ain't never letting go.

03:01.272 --> 03:02.439
All right, let go.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.774
Okay.

03:03.775 --> 03:05.141
Peggy.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.376
You look tired.

03:07.378 --> 03:10.513
It's weird, but
I actually missed that.

03:10.515 --> 03:11.715
Come on, sit down,

03:11.716 --> 03:13.583
we want to hear all about
the writing program.

03:13.584 --> 03:15.217
All right, well,
it was a doozy.

03:21.358 --> 03:23.860
Well, for eight intense weeks,
I was surrounded

03:23.861 --> 03:27.096
by brilliant novelists
and poets and playwrights.

03:27.098 --> 03:29.098
It sounds wonderful.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.500
No, it was awful.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.334
They hated my writing.

03:32.336 --> 03:34.738
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
No, don't be.

03:34.739 --> 03:36.940
The more they hated it,
the more it drove me.

03:36.941 --> 03:38.807
I dug deep,
I found my voice.

03:38.809 --> 03:40.642
I bet you have
a beautiful voice.

03:40.644 --> 03:44.280
No. Turns out my voice
has the mouth of a sailor.

03:44.281 --> 03:45.547
Dirty?

03:45.549 --> 03:47.050
Filthy.

03:47.051 --> 03:49.919
I know I've written some racy
short stories in the past,

03:49.920 --> 03:51.587
but this new stuff
takes the cake.

03:51.589 --> 03:54.290
Actually, in the second chapter,
I wrote this thing with cake.

03:54.291 --> 03:56.091
It's disgusting.

03:56.093 --> 03:57.494
She gets it from me.

03:57.495 --> 03:59.129
You know, you never think
they're listening,

03:59.130 --> 04:01.230
but they're little sponges.

04:01.232 --> 04:05.134
You know, I mean, it started out
so innocently enough.

04:05.135 --> 04:07.303
You know, just kind of
a romantic little story

04:07.304 --> 04:09.505
about two lonely people
who meet in Chicago, and...

04:09.506 --> 04:10.872
Aw, that's us.

04:10.874 --> 04:11.773
Oh, God, no.

04:11.775 --> 04:13.076
No?
No!

04:13.077 --> 04:15.144
No, we are nothing
like these animals.

04:15.145 --> 04:16.579
No morals, no boundaries.

04:16.579 --> 04:19.148
Just two people who are
willing to stop at nothing

04:19.149 --> 04:21.315
until they satisfy
their carnal desires.

04:21.317 --> 04:23.051
Ooh, that's a spicy blurb.

04:23.053 --> 04:25.388
Well, you know what?
That's what the publisher said

04:25.389 --> 04:27.589
when he bought my book!

04:27.591 --> 04:30.192
(cheering)

04:30.194 --> 04:32.128
(indistinct, excited chatter)

04:32.129 --> 04:34.564
The school... the school
sent out samples,

04:34.565 --> 04:36.766
and out of the piles
of pretentious fire,

04:36.767 --> 04:39.201
my hot, throbbing
phoenix rose!

04:39.202 --> 04:42.538
You sold a book!
I sold a book!

Son of a bitch!

Ooh!

05:20.070 --> 05:24.374
That was worth the wait.

05:24.375 --> 05:27.710
So, uh...

05:27.711 --> 05:29.678
can I see it again?

05:29.680 --> 05:31.881
I already
showed it to you.

05:31.882 --> 05:35.117
Come on. I like looking at it.

05:35.119 --> 05:36.653
God, you're insatiable.

05:36.654 --> 05:38.354
(giggles)

05:38.355 --> 05:40.356
Oh!

05:40.357 --> 05:42.090
Wow. Unreal.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.493
Oh, it's real.

05:43.494 --> 05:46.129
Now I just have to actually
finish writing the book. (laughs)

05:46.130 --> 05:48.130
They paid you
before you finished?

05:48.132 --> 05:50.199
Tried that with a plumber once.
Never again.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.035
(laughs)

05:52.036 --> 05:53.336
Unbelievable.

05:53.337 --> 05:55.438
I know.

05:55.439 --> 05:58.641
You know, when you quit teaching
to become a writer,

05:58.642 --> 06:00.643
I-I got to admit...

06:00.644 --> 06:02.278
I'm not gonna admit.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.280
No, tell me, tell me.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.882
Well, it's just I've always
known that you were talented,

06:06.883 --> 06:09.252
but, like, you know,
pay-for-groceries talented.

06:09.253 --> 06:11.319
Not kiss-my-ass-Citibank
talented.

06:11.321 --> 06:12.555
(giggling)

06:12.556 --> 06:14.924
I know. I didn't think
I could do it, either.

06:14.925 --> 06:16.158
Really?
Oh, yeah.

06:16.159 --> 06:18.060
I felt like a total
fraud since day one.

06:18.061 --> 06:20.162
Thank God we never talked
about this honestly.

06:20.163 --> 06:21.463
(laughing)

06:21.465 --> 06:24.400
Yeah, or else we
wouldn't have this, huh?

06:24.401 --> 06:28.471
Well, here's to us both
pretending we believed in me.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.740
To love, honor and deceive.

06:32.742 --> 06:35.578
You know I couldn't have
done this without you.

06:35.579 --> 06:36.879
What are you talking about?

06:36.880 --> 06:40.582
I mean, I mean,
sure, I was your sexual muse.

06:40.584 --> 06:43.285
No. I'm talking about
you supporting me,

06:43.286 --> 06:45.454
even when this
whole writing thing

06:45.455 --> 06:47.590
just seemed like
a stupid pipe dream.

06:47.591 --> 06:50.925
Yeah, I do come out of this
smelling pretty good, don't I?

06:50.927 --> 06:52.528
Like a big,
handsome daisy.

06:52.529 --> 06:54.329
(chuckling)

06:54.330 --> 06:56.231
You think you
could look at me

06:56.232 --> 06:59.133
the way you're looking
at that check?

06:59.135 --> 07:01.203
Gladly.
(giggling)

07:01.204 --> 07:02.770
You ready for the sequel?

07:02.772 --> 07:04.072
You got another
one in you?

07:04.073 --> 07:05.641
We'll let the critics decide.

07:05.642 --> 07:07.441
(giggling)

07:11.613 --> 07:13.615
Oh, writer in session.

07:13.616 --> 07:15.150
I was gonna get a snack.

07:15.151 --> 07:16.351
Should I come back later?

07:16.352 --> 07:18.552
No, it's fine.

07:19.354 --> 07:21.423
Can I make you a snack?

07:21.424 --> 07:23.291
Nope.
Tea?

07:23.292 --> 07:25.494
I'm good.

07:25.495 --> 07:26.928
Is the lighting okay in here?

07:26.929 --> 07:29.396
You want a floor lamp?
Vince?! Mom!

07:29.398 --> 07:31.165
I'm fine. I'm fine.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.602
Okay. Okay. I just
want to make sure

07:33.603 --> 07:37.338
my little golden goose has
a nice nest to write in.

07:37.340 --> 07:40.342
I'm still the exact same person
I was before.

07:40.343 --> 07:42.243
I just have
a little bit more money.

07:42.245 --> 07:43.812
A <i> lot</i> more money.

07:43.813 --> 07:46.948
Which, in America, makes you
better than everybody else.

07:46.949 --> 07:48.750
Oh, my Lord!

07:48.751 --> 07:50.485
Mol, this book...

07:50.486 --> 07:51.719
The stuff at the farm?

07:51.721 --> 07:53.254
Guess when you introduce
a milking machine

07:53.255 --> 07:55.222
in chapter one,
you got to use it.

07:56.324 --> 07:58.326
I still can't
believe you went off

07:58.327 --> 08:02.263
to this fancy writing program
and came out with porno gold.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.298
It's not porno.

08:04.300 --> 08:07.168
It's an exploration of sexuality
for the everyday woman

08:07.169 --> 08:09.604
who doesn't get
to see herself reflected

08:09.605 --> 08:11.305
in an adult romance novel.

08:11.307 --> 08:13.274
Molly.
It's not porno. It's empowering.

08:13.275 --> 08:15.376
It's saying
that all women deserve

08:15.377 --> 08:17.078
to experience physical intimacy

08:17.079 --> 08:19.379
and explore their deepest,
darkest fantasies.

08:19.381 --> 08:21.249
Molly...
All right,

08:21.250 --> 08:23.251
it's a little porno, but...

08:23.252 --> 08:24.719
I mean, it's written well,

08:24.720 --> 08:26.854
and-and there's some good
life lessons in there,

08:26.855 --> 08:29.089
you know, between the orgies.

08:30.324 --> 08:32.527
Hey, you want to make this
a best-seller?

08:32.528 --> 08:36.263
Laminate it, so a lady can
read it in the tub.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.732
You know what?

08:37.732 --> 08:39.866
That's actually not a bad idea.

08:40.902 --> 08:45.673
Hey, what do you say
we go out and celebrate,

08:45.674 --> 08:47.575
and spend some
of this dirty money?

08:47.576 --> 08:48.843
Mmm, that's sounds good.

08:48.844 --> 08:51.478
I'll Saran Wrap this
and finish it in the bath later.

08:51.480 --> 08:54.047
Oh, did you decide who's gonna
play you in the movie?

08:54.049 --> 08:55.950
Once again,
the character is not me.

08:55.951 --> 08:58.218
I don't know.
Probably Renée Zellweger.

09:02.857 --> 09:04.725
I'm telling you, Carl,

09:04.726 --> 09:07.427
you can't imagine the relief
I felt last night.

09:07.429 --> 09:09.296
Well, sure. Your wife was gone
for eight weeks.

09:09.297 --> 09:12.565
And you had quite a full sack
there, Santa.

09:20.140 --> 09:21.542
Not that.
Oh.

09:21.543 --> 09:23.544
I'm talking about the money.

09:23.545 --> 09:26.714
Molly's advance almost gets us
completely out of debt.

09:26.715 --> 09:28.282
Almost? That was a hell
of a check.

09:28.283 --> 09:30.117
What kind of hole
did you dig yourself into?

09:30.118 --> 09:31.385
Not my hole. Hers.

09:31.386 --> 09:34.220
We walked down the aisle,
and I fell right into it.

09:34.222 --> 09:36.523
Hey, did you hear?
Molly sold her book.

09:36.524 --> 09:38.592
No.
Yup.

09:38.593 --> 09:40.160
Big advance and everything.

09:40.161 --> 09:43.529
You know what this means?
Yeah, I can eat in a better restaurant.

09:44.832 --> 09:47.433
It means the American Dream
is still alive.

09:47.435 --> 09:49.736
If a humble schoolteacher
like Molly can achieve success,

09:49.737 --> 09:52.672
there's hope
for a struggling artist like me.

09:52.674 --> 09:54.641
Yeah, top me off, Picasso.

09:54.642 --> 09:56.276
I'm serious.

09:56.277 --> 09:58.745
This inspires me
to keep pursuing my dream

09:58.746 --> 10:01.782
of becoming a famous stand-up
comedian with my own TV show.

10:01.783 --> 10:03.150
On cable, of course.

10:03.151 --> 10:05.518
That's where all
the good stuff is done.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.355
Hopefully you'll be able
to fill a comedy club

10:08.356 --> 10:10.489
better than you can
a coffee mug.

10:10.491 --> 10:13.794
You really think I left Senegal
in the wheel well

10:13.795 --> 10:17.563
of a cargo jet to serve you
losers crappy food?

10:20.133 --> 10:23.370
He changes the story
about how he got to America

10:23.371 --> 10:25.104
every time he tells it.

10:25.106 --> 10:27.374
Yeah, I like the one where he
was on the boat with the tiger.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.374
Mm-hmm.

10:28.376 --> 10:32.112
(car horn honking)

10:32.113 --> 10:33.979
What is going on out there?
I don't know.

10:33.981 --> 10:37.082
Is it the Puerto Rican Day
Parade already?

10:37.917 --> 10:40.520
(horn honking)

10:40.521 --> 10:43.327
Surprise!

10:45.091 --> 10:47.693
God bless America.

10:59.908 --> 11:01.184
What did you do?

11:01.186 --> 11:05.022
I bought us
a brand-new car!

11:05.023 --> 11:07.023
This Dodge Challenger

11:07.025 --> 11:09.259
comes fully-equipped
with a heated steering wheel

11:09.261 --> 11:10.961
and illuminated cup holders.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.295
What?

11:12.297 --> 11:13.864
(laughing)

11:13.865 --> 11:15.399
You bought a car?

11:15.400 --> 11:16.867
Cash money, honey.

11:16.868 --> 11:18.134
The ladies and I
were out to lunch...

11:18.136 --> 11:19.470
Had a few cocktails.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.971
"Obvi."

11:20.972 --> 11:22.672
I was just trying to think
of a way to say thank you

11:22.674 --> 11:25.308
for being so amazing
this last year.

11:25.310 --> 11:26.510
And I looked out
the restaurant window,

11:26.511 --> 11:28.412
and I see this little orange
dream sitting here

11:28.413 --> 11:30.047
and I started picturing my baby

11:30.048 --> 11:33.716
getting into this baby,
and I thought, "Oh, baby."

11:34.551 --> 11:36.086
You bought a car.

11:36.087 --> 11:37.353
I bought a car.

11:37.355 --> 11:39.790
(imitates crowd cheering)

11:39.791 --> 11:41.858
Knock it off.

11:41.860 --> 11:44.161
We don't need a car.
I've got the Mitsubishi.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.662
Well, just put it out
on the lawn,

11:45.663 --> 11:46.830
like you did the couch.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.130
Somebody's going to take it.

11:48.132 --> 11:51.067
Why didn't you talk to me
about this?

11:51.069 --> 11:52.569
Because you would've said
we should use the money

11:52.570 --> 11:53.704
to pay down our debt.

11:53.705 --> 11:56.439
We <i> should</i> use the money
to pay down our debt.

11:56.441 --> 11:59.341
- See? Mike, I was trying...
- Oh.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.577
To do something
nice for you

12:00.578 --> 12:02.011
that you wouldn't
do for yourself.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.380
Come on, sit in it.
No.

12:03.381 --> 12:05.215
Come on, sit in it.
No.

12:05.216 --> 12:07.217
I'll sit in it.
No!

12:07.218 --> 12:08.885
Nobody is sitting in this car
except Molly

12:08.886 --> 12:09.920
to take it back.

12:09.921 --> 12:11.087
I'm not taking it back.

12:11.088 --> 12:12.288
You're taking
this back.

12:12.290 --> 12:13.557
Mike, don't be a jerk.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.492
I love you.
Take the damn car.

12:15.493 --> 12:16.626
Molly, I love you, too.

12:16.627 --> 12:17.827
Don't be stupid.
Take it back.

12:17.828 --> 12:19.396
Hey, we don't use
the "S" word.

12:19.397 --> 12:20.697
You called me a "J."

12:20.698 --> 12:23.099
Well, you're lucky
I didn't call you an "A-H""

12:23.100 --> 12:24.267
Guys, guys, stop

12:24.268 --> 12:26.403
before you spell something
you're gonna regret.

12:26.404 --> 12:27.937
I got news for you, pal.

12:27.938 --> 12:29.205
I'm gonna keep succeeding

12:29.206 --> 12:31.074
and I'm going to keep buying
stupid stuff.

12:31.075 --> 12:33.175
So you either get on this train
or get out of the way.

12:33.177 --> 12:34.577
All aboard, ladies.

12:34.578 --> 12:36.011
And yeah, I know
I'm getting into a car

12:36.013 --> 12:37.313
while using a train metaphor,

12:37.314 --> 12:39.549
but frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.251
Yeah, I'm quoting
<i>Gone with the Wind.</i>

12:41.252 --> 12:43.285
And if you don't like it,
you can kiss my grits.

12:46.022 --> 12:48.223
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

12:53.496 --> 12:55.565
Don't you think you're going
a little fast, sweetie?

12:55.566 --> 12:57.200
Who the hell doesn't
jump up and down

12:57.201 --> 12:58.801
when they get a new car?

12:58.802 --> 13:00.670
In Mike's defense,
I've never seen him jump.

13:00.671 --> 13:03.973
Oh, I walked in on him naked
in the bathroom once.

13:03.974 --> 13:05.942
He caught some air.

13:05.943 --> 13:08.644
You know, I worked too hard
to take this car back.

13:08.645 --> 13:12.080
I deserve satellite radio
and a heated steering wheel.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.449
Actually, my fingers
are frying.

13:13.450 --> 13:16.252
Just turn-turn it off.
Turn it off.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.987
You know, now that
I'm losing my buzz,

13:17.988 --> 13:21.157
this does seem like
a pretty big purchase.

13:21.158 --> 13:23.025
Are you saying
I should take this back?

13:23.026 --> 13:24.894
Or go get another drink.

13:24.895 --> 13:26.896
I... I got a book deal.

13:26.897 --> 13:28.264
How am I supposed to rub

13:28.265 --> 13:31.132
a zero-balance credit card
statement in people's faces?

13:31.134 --> 13:32.601
You don't need to rub
anything in anybody's face.

13:32.602 --> 13:34.036
She did in chapter three.

13:34.037 --> 13:36.271
Speed bump!

13:40.342 --> 13:42.144
Hey.

13:42.145 --> 13:43.845
Hello, dummy.

13:43.847 --> 13:46.147
What's your problem?

13:46.149 --> 13:47.583
On behalf of every man
in this country,

13:47.584 --> 13:50.218
I should kick you
in the potatoes.

13:50.220 --> 13:54.155
Good luck. They've already been
peeled and mashed.

13:54.157 --> 13:55.691
She wanted to give you a car.

13:55.692 --> 13:58.760
Why couldn't you just take it
like a good little husband?

13:58.762 --> 14:00.696
Because I can buy my own car.

14:00.697 --> 14:02.965
Two things:
Number one... no, you can't.

14:02.966 --> 14:04.933
Number two...

14:04.934 --> 14:07.168
no, you can't.

14:07.170 --> 14:08.737
Look, it's not right, okay?

14:08.738 --> 14:10.606
I'm supposed to shower <i> her</i>
with gifts,

14:10.607 --> 14:11.840
not vice versa.

14:11.841 --> 14:14.109
It's like that Ferris wheel
sex scene in her book...

14:14.110 --> 14:17.145
everything's backwards
and upside down.

14:17.146 --> 14:18.714
What the hell's
wrong with you?

14:18.715 --> 14:21.049
Women want to be
the man? Let 'em.

14:21.050 --> 14:23.285
They can pull out my chair,
open my door.

14:23.286 --> 14:27.656
Put their coat on my bare
shoulders when it's cold.

14:27.657 --> 14:30.453
Your shoulders don't need
a coat... they need a comb.

14:31.493 --> 14:34.830
As far as I'm concerned,
broads can have the power,

14:34.831 --> 14:36.765
and all the crap
that goes with it...

14:36.766 --> 14:40.768
hair loss, hypertension,
prostate problems.

14:40.770 --> 14:42.236
Women don't have prostates.

14:42.238 --> 14:43.738
Give 'em time.

14:45.207 --> 14:46.708
Then sit back and relax.

14:46.709 --> 14:48.176
They'll die ten years before us,

14:48.177 --> 14:51.046
and we'll be the ones who are
able to walk around the mall

14:51.047 --> 14:54.683
in big red hats, spending their
life insurance policies.

14:54.684 --> 14:58.186
That's the world
I want to live in.

14:58.187 --> 15:00.889
Well, if it includes you in
a red hat with bare shoulders,

15:00.890 --> 15:03.757
I'm going to stay here
with my swollen prostate.

15:08.296 --> 15:11.032
So what if you're a little rusty
around the edges.

15:11.033 --> 15:14.469
You still got a couple of good
years left, don't you, girl?

15:14.470 --> 15:18.139
MOLLY (playfully):
Kill me.

15:18.140 --> 15:21.008
Kill me.

15:21.010 --> 15:23.076
That's very funny.

15:23.912 --> 15:28.049
So, how's the old bucket
of bolts doing?

15:28.050 --> 15:29.950
If you remember correctly,
this bucket of bolts

15:29.952 --> 15:32.186
was good enough for you
when we first started dating.

15:32.188 --> 15:33.821
No, I hated it
from the beginning.

15:33.822 --> 15:35.189
I was just being polite.

15:35.190 --> 15:38.191
I was trying to get
in your pants.

15:38.193 --> 15:39.761
You kidding?

15:39.762 --> 15:41.629
You could have said you hated
the Bulls, Bears, Cubs

15:41.630 --> 15:44.866
and cops, these pants
were gettin' got into.

15:44.867 --> 15:47.468
I got you something.

15:47.469 --> 15:48.569
What's this?

15:48.570 --> 15:50.238
It's a little less
flashy tribute

15:50.239 --> 15:53.373
to my supportive husband.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.008
Tube socks!

15:55.010 --> 15:57.210
Gold toe. Gold toe.

15:57.212 --> 16:00.614
Nice.

16:01.449 --> 16:03.850
You forgive me?

16:03.852 --> 16:07.021
Molly, you bought a car
without even talking to me.

16:07.022 --> 16:09.623
Honey, it was a bad-ass car.

16:11.559 --> 16:13.060
But...

16:13.061 --> 16:14.428
it was the wrong
thing to do,

16:14.429 --> 16:16.597
and I'm sorry.

16:16.598 --> 16:18.398
Thank you.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.334
I know you're
this big fancy writer now,

16:20.335 --> 16:21.869
making all this money but...

16:21.870 --> 16:25.106
you buying that car without me
made me feel superfluous.

16:25.107 --> 16:26.973
"Superfluous"?

16:26.975 --> 16:30.143
I read it in your book.
I had to look it up.

16:30.145 --> 16:32.913
Mike, you could never be
superfluous.

16:32.914 --> 16:36.149
I... I will always need you.

16:36.151 --> 16:37.384
Good.

16:37.385 --> 16:39.719
I used it right.

16:40.554 --> 16:43.991
So, you read my book?

16:43.992 --> 16:46.093
Of course I did.

16:46.094 --> 16:48.696
Well... what'd you think?

16:48.697 --> 16:52.199
I think that in between
all the orgies,

16:52.200 --> 16:54.734
you got some really
good stuff in there.

16:57.771 --> 16:59.907
You get me.

16:59.908 --> 17:02.108
You really get me.

17:04.077 --> 17:06.479
(groans)

17:06.481 --> 17:07.681
You want to follow me
back to the dealer,

17:07.682 --> 17:09.215
'cause I'm going to
take that car back.

17:09.217 --> 17:10.550
Yes.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.419
I know it doesn't feel good,

17:12.420 --> 17:14.788
but deep down, you know
it's the smart choice.

17:14.789 --> 17:16.089
Well, smart sucks.

17:16.089 --> 17:17.957
I love you, too.

17:20.093 --> 17:21.861
(grunts)

17:21.863 --> 17:24.430
(engine turns, stops)
Come on.

17:25.198 --> 17:27.166
(engine turns, stops)
Come on!

17:27.167 --> 17:28.901
(engine starting)

17:30.070 --> 17:31.304
Hey!

17:31.305 --> 17:32.305
There you go!

17:32.306 --> 17:34.441
See?

17:34.442 --> 17:36.909
We don't need a new car.

17:48.364 --> 17:49.832
Call Mike.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.234
CHALLENGER:
Your number is being dialed.

17:51.235 --> 17:56.772
Oh, God, we could've been
such good friends.

17:56.773 --> 17:58.341
Hello?
MOLLY: Where are you?

17:58.342 --> 17:59.774
I'm a couple blocks
from the house.

17:59.776 --> 18:01.343
Where are you?

18:01.345 --> 18:02.678
I'm almost to the expressway.

18:02.679 --> 18:04.679
For God sakes,
how fast are you going?

18:04.681 --> 18:05.915
I don't know. Not very...

18:05.916 --> 18:07.316
Ooh, almost 80.

18:07.317 --> 18:09.251
Whoa!
God, it's so smooth.

18:09.252 --> 18:10.885
I'll slow down.

18:10.887 --> 18:12.688
Okay, hang on.
Okay, I-I see you.

18:12.689 --> 18:14.422
I'll be there in a minute.

18:14.424 --> 18:16.124
All right, first one
to the dealership wins.

18:16.126 --> 18:17.493
No, I don't want to race.

18:17.494 --> 18:19.294
Come on, I'll keep it in first.

18:19.296 --> 18:22.130
Molly...
Here we go.

18:22.132 --> 18:23.899
All right, damn it.

18:23.900 --> 18:27.268
Okay, old girl,
let's show her what we can do.

18:27.270 --> 18:29.437
(bang)

18:31.407 --> 18:34.942
Oh, boy.

18:34.944 --> 18:36.478
Ooh, careful.

18:36.479 --> 18:39.114
Looks like a car's caught fire
back there.

18:39.115 --> 18:42.117
Yeah, that jackass
is blocking traffic.

18:42.118 --> 18:44.219
I'll meet you at the dealership.

18:44.220 --> 18:45.453
(horn honking)

18:45.455 --> 18:47.321
Yeah, yeah! Go around!
