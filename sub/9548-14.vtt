WEBVTT

00:01.815 --> 00:02.820
Right.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:13.258 --> 00:16.062
That's great.
No, I'm sure he'll be glad to see you.

00:16.943 --> 00:18.672
Okay, so what's the cross street?

00:18.799 --> 00:21.633
I do know where that is.
Across from the wells fargo building.

00:22.986 --> 00:26.890
Great. 1:00. We'll see you there.
No, thank you.

00:29.224 --> 00:30.162
Who was that?

00:30.287 --> 00:32.177
Remember how we were
talking about karma?

00:32.313 --> 00:33.402
No, I don't.

00:33.536 --> 00:35.479
Remember when I said
if you put good energy

00:35.604 --> 00:38.470
out into the world good things
will come back. Well it worked.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.739
That was a real client with a real job.

00:40.877 --> 00:44.537
- The drought is over.
- Great, great. So what's the case?

00:45.009 --> 00:48.524
He wouldn't say. We're gonna meet him
tomorrow. His name is Roderick Brody.

00:50.732 --> 00:52.674
- I used to know someone.
- No that's the guy.

00:52.799 --> 00:54.500
He said you went to school with him.

00:55.849 --> 00:59.233
- Roderick Brody.
- Yeah, he said you were old friends.

01:07.838 --> 01:09.036
What's happening?

01:10.046 --> 01:13.238
- Hello, Roger.
- Washing your hands again?

01:13.662 --> 01:16.950
What is this the, tenth time today?
What a freak.

01:17.541 --> 01:19.576
You know, his hands are clean

01:19.925 --> 01:22.438
but his hair looks a little dirty.
What do you think?

01:23.320 --> 01:25.098
And is that watch right?

01:26.065 --> 01:27.476
Oh, man, it's 2:25.

01:28.718 --> 01:32.197
- Swirly time.
- No, not swirly time. Not again.

01:32.469 --> 01:34.237
Actually that watch is two minutes fast.

01:34.362 --> 01:37.845
- Go grab the door.
- Roger, wait. How about this?

01:38.153 --> 01:41.509
I'll give you my bike for keeps
and all my lunch money every day

01:41.644 --> 01:43.856
and I'll do your homework
for the whole year.

01:45.429 --> 01:46.782
Okay. It's a deal.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.171
But first, swirly time.

02:07.526 --> 02:08.723
My hand hurts.

02:10.133 --> 02:11.931
Mr. Monk where is your oven mitt?

02:13.391 --> 02:15.513
Come here, come here, come...

02:18.231 --> 02:21.052
you okay?
What were you doing?

02:25.794 --> 02:26.993
He's back.

02:34.371 --> 02:37.405
S07E14 - Mr. Monk and the Bully

03:32.980 --> 03:36.465
- Thank you again for squeezing me in.
- I'm happy to do it, Adrian.

03:36.621 --> 03:39.968
Just something I still don't understand.
We already had an appointment for 3:00.

03:40.395 --> 03:44.114
3:00 is too late.
You remember Roderick Brody?

03:45.523 --> 03:49.523
That's the bully from middle school
who used to, you know. In the lavatory.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.811
Swirlies. They're called swirlies.

03:53.059 --> 03:54.219
He called

03:54.528 --> 03:57.391
yesterday. I'm supposed
to meet with him this afternoon.

03:57.516 --> 03:58.598
What does he want?

03:59.568 --> 04:02.535
What do you think he wants?
He wants to pick up where he left off.

04:04.139 --> 04:06.212
I don't think a 50-year-old man

04:06.337 --> 04:09.085
is calling you back after
all this time just to...

04:09.753 --> 04:12.259
- To give you another swirly.
- You don't?

04:12.384 --> 04:14.170
- No, I don't.
- Okay, look.

04:15.140 --> 04:17.851
Roderick Brody changed my life.

04:17.976 --> 04:21.676
Maybe as much as Trudy did.
He ruined everything.

04:23.276 --> 04:25.885
It was childhood's end really.

04:26.485 --> 04:28.977
You know I had a Bully in school too.

04:29.849 --> 04:32.777
He would wait for me
every morning outside the bicycle rack.

04:32.911 --> 04:34.691
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

04:34.826 --> 04:36.445
You went to your father

04:36.735 --> 04:39.943
for advice and he told you
to face upto the Bully and

04:40.328 --> 04:42.144
the Bully backed down.

04:42.384 --> 04:45.727
- Yes, more or less, yes.
- What a wonderful anecdote.

04:46.221 --> 04:48.320
It'll give me something
to think about at 1:00

04:48.445 --> 04:52.176
- when my head is in the man's toilet.
- Why don't you just cancel?

04:52.362 --> 04:54.708
- Just say you're busy.
- Natalie won't let me!

04:55.681 --> 04:59.038
It's the first paying customer
we've had in three weeks. Look,

04:59.526 --> 05:01.690
what I need is a note,

05:02.733 --> 05:04.260
okay? A note from you.

05:04.385 --> 05:08.048
Something I can show Natalie
to get me out of this.

05:08.872 --> 05:12.177
- I'm not gonna write you a note.
- You don't have to write it.

05:12.621 --> 05:13.812
It's already written.

05:17.654 --> 05:20.243
All you have to do...
is sign it.

05:21.533 --> 05:23.446
Adrian, this isn't gym class.

05:23.728 --> 05:27.496
Now you've been talking about this
Roderick Brody since the first session.

05:28.182 --> 05:30.908
And as I recall, you're still
having nightmares about him.

05:31.211 --> 05:34.245
I think this meeting today is a gift.

05:34.742 --> 05:37.168
- It's an opportunity.
- Maybe you right. Let's sign the note.

05:37.293 --> 05:41.278
It's an opportunity to confront
your deepest and most troubling fears.

05:41.804 --> 05:43.427
To finally resolve them.

05:43.717 --> 05:46.422
Put them all behind you.
Not many people get this chance.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.114
I see your point.

05:51.994 --> 05:54.119
I never looked at it like that.

05:55.714 --> 05:59.192
- Can I have the note back?
- Sure. Wait a...

06:00.284 --> 06:03.008
you're not planning
to forge my signature?

06:21.976 --> 06:22.976
God.

06:23.114 --> 06:26.139
Let's just hear what he has to say.
If you're not comfortable, we'll leave.

06:26.264 --> 06:27.739
- I promise.
- Really?

06:28.573 --> 06:30.607
- I'm not comfortable.
- Come on.

06:34.501 --> 06:37.709
- Not comfortable.
- Mr. Monk, we haven't even said hello.

06:39.564 --> 06:40.837
Wait. Wait.

06:43.372 --> 06:45.612
Okay wait!Okay, wait, wait.

06:47.825 --> 06:50.151
What is that?
Is that a shower cap?

06:50.750 --> 06:52.605
Sometimes he'd let me wear one.

06:52.753 --> 06:55.296
Mr. Monk, I don't think
we're gonna be needing that.

06:58.746 --> 07:00.795
And you must be Natalie.

07:01.244 --> 07:04.353
Marilyn Brody.
Roderick is so looking forward to this.

07:04.527 --> 07:06.990
- I'm sure he is.
- Come in. Please.

07:09.503 --> 07:10.972
What a beautiful home.

07:11.603 --> 07:15.603
Thank you. You are very sweet.
Really, it's a work in progress.

07:15.997 --> 07:18.301
We're redoing all
the bathrooms upstairs.

07:18.527 --> 07:20.568
Which reminds me I need
to call the contractor.

07:20.693 --> 07:23.332
- We're having a party in three weeks.
- Did you get married here?

07:23.457 --> 07:25.962
Yes, there was no reason
to rent a big hall.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.799
I don't have much family. I was adopted.

07:29.418 --> 07:31.564
Just one aunt in Texas.
She didn't even make it.

07:31.689 --> 07:34.268
Well I had a small wedding too.
I think they're the best.

07:35.177 --> 07:36.563
He's obviously busy.

07:37.263 --> 07:40.232
So it's too bad we missed him. But
we should go, Natalie. We missed him.

07:40.357 --> 07:43.856
No, you can't go. He's right upstairs.
I'll tell him you're here.

07:44.473 --> 07:46.606
- It was so nice to meet you.
- You too.

07:51.158 --> 07:53.493
She seems nice.
How bad could her husband be?

07:53.618 --> 07:57.129
Doesn't always work like that. Eva Braun
took in stray puppies for god's sake.

07:57.254 --> 07:59.168
At least we know his
checks won't bounce.

08:00.077 --> 08:03.015
Look at that thing.
That is hideous.

08:06.217 --> 08:08.696
God.
He's warming up.

08:09.524 --> 08:11.052
Shower cap.

08:11.242 --> 08:13.288
- No.
- Shower cap! Give it.

08:13.413 --> 08:14.751
You don't need it.

08:14.892 --> 08:17.945
Phil, shut up and listen, okay?
It's not a complicated thing.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.826
It's not his money. It's my money.
You tell him this.

08:22.189 --> 08:25.300
Screwing with me on this is a career
decision. He'll get the message.

08:28.768 --> 08:32.455
Look at you.
You haven't changed at all.

08:35.669 --> 08:37.313
You still got that germ thing?

08:38.511 --> 08:40.225
He was always afraid of touching people.

08:40.350 --> 08:42.352
Natalie Teeger, designated hand-shaker.

08:42.893 --> 08:44.970
We were just admiring
your beautiful home.

08:45.262 --> 08:47.030
Yeah, gets the job done.

08:48.071 --> 08:50.757
If you don't mind my asking,
is this an original?

08:50.896 --> 08:53.838
- Well it better be, what I paid for it.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.573
Thanks, yeah.
Marilyn picked it up on our honeymoon.

08:56.936 --> 08:57.936
It's porcelain.

08:58.656 --> 09:01.066
I don't gotta tell you about porcelain.
Do i, swirly?

09:02.369 --> 09:04.804
It was a little nickname
we had for him back in the day.

09:05.897 --> 09:08.254
Remember those shenanigans
in the boys'room?

09:09.051 --> 09:10.095
Good times.

09:11.082 --> 09:13.607
I got a study back here.
We can, talk in private?

09:14.972 --> 09:16.209
Shenanigans.

09:23.405 --> 09:24.429
Want a drink?

09:26.368 --> 09:28.334
Well I got plenty here
if you change your mind.

09:29.163 --> 09:31.386
Listen, Adrian, I gotta be honest.

09:32.160 --> 09:33.377
I've heard stories.

09:34.378 --> 09:38.300
I heard you went a little crazy since we
graduated. Now I just need to know, is

09:38.882 --> 09:41.181
it funny crazy or sad crazy?

09:42.243 --> 09:43.720
- Funny crazy.
- Sad crazy.

09:47.056 --> 09:49.931
Excuse me.
There's something that I have to say.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.964
"You stole something from me.

10:00.795 --> 10:02.452
"You stole my childhood.

10:03.338 --> 10:06.294
"The boy that you tormented has grown

10:07.134 --> 10:08.481
"into a broken man.

10:09.112 --> 10:11.465
"I am now damaged goods.
"I will never

10:11.631 --> 10:15.015
recover from the wounds
"that you inflicted on me.

10:16.371 --> 10:20.371
"I will never forget you.
And I will never forgive you."

10:23.712 --> 10:25.021
So it's sad crazy.

10:25.931 --> 10:28.195
No, I think Mr. Monk
is talking about what you

10:28.732 --> 10:32.090
did to him in the seventh grade.
You tortured him.

10:32.917 --> 10:35.875
Kids. What are you gonna do?
Let's have a seat?

10:37.905 --> 10:39.895
I really appreciate your coming, Adrian.

10:42.647 --> 10:45.648
I know that Marilyn thinks this is about
some union business at the landfill.

10:45.783 --> 10:49.177
But the fact is...
this is a personal matter.

10:50.266 --> 10:53.844
I need your help, Adrian.
I hear you're a big shot detective now.

10:54.683 --> 10:57.906
No surprise there.
I always knew you had it upstairs.

11:01.659 --> 11:05.216
This is hard for me.
It's probably hard for any guy.

11:08.767 --> 11:10.526
I think Marilyn's been stepping out.

11:14.276 --> 11:16.286
- Really?
- Yeah, I didn't believe it either.

11:16.974 --> 11:19.574
Me and Marilyn,
we've always been, you know,

11:20.787 --> 11:22.004
rock solid.

11:23.318 --> 11:24.845
At least that's what I thought.

11:25.398 --> 11:28.579
Last week she told me she was going out
of town with some girlfriends,

11:28.704 --> 11:31.205
but she never left.
I saw her.

11:32.595 --> 11:36.260
- Well where was this?
- Lafayette square two days ago.

11:36.940 --> 11:39.559
It was just a random thing.

11:40.490 --> 11:43.909
I was in a cab.
There was a red light.

11:45.319 --> 11:48.093
And there she was...
Crossing the street.

11:49.359 --> 11:51.842
She was meeting someone.

11:53.165 --> 11:55.406
I could tell the way she was walking.

11:56.284 --> 11:57.685
The way she was dressed.

11:58.659 --> 12:00.402
It's been eating me up.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.823
I gotta know where was she going.

12:06.108 --> 12:09.763
- It's a good question.
- Mr. Brody, I'm sorry.

12:09.898 --> 12:13.902
We don't take on matrimonial cases.
We could give you the name of a private.

12:14.249 --> 12:15.466
Hold on, Natalie.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.655
I've known rod for years.

12:20.482 --> 12:21.323
Well...

12:21.652 --> 12:24.763
He's one of my...
Oldest friends.

12:26.176 --> 12:27.902
I think we can make an exception.

12:31.526 --> 12:32.801
I'll take the case.

12:38.268 --> 12:39.592
What was that about?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.949
- She's cheating on him.
- We don't know that.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.203
Of course we do. It has to be true.
It's always true.

12:45.344 --> 12:47.835
And I get to tell him, Natalie.
This is gonna kill him!

12:47.960 --> 12:51.045
- Mr. Monk, you can't enjoying this.
- I am loving it.

12:51.518 --> 12:54.823
Look, it's a beautiful day.
I think the sun's coming out.

12:55.105 --> 12:58.567
Oh, my god.
This is better than a swirly.

12:58.987 --> 13:02.987
I win. Do you understand?
After 40 years, i win.

13:15.264 --> 13:18.162
Okay, he said he lost
track of her right here.

13:18.836 --> 13:20.286
Which way did she go?

13:21.654 --> 13:23.345
- That way.
- I don't think so.

13:23.473 --> 13:24.922
She was wearing high heels.

13:25.244 --> 13:27.393
That's a cobblestone
street and it's all uphill.

13:27.528 --> 13:28.560
So west?

13:28.685 --> 13:30.819
No, there's nothing
between here and the pier.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.055
All right,
well that leaves north or south.

13:37.146 --> 13:39.070
- That way.
- Why that way?

13:39.195 --> 13:40.377
I feel Lucky!

13:41.609 --> 13:44.739
Isn't this a great case?
Isn't this the best case ever?

13:44.909 --> 13:46.317
I've never seen you like this.

13:46.442 --> 13:48.955
I never knew revenge could be so sweet.

13:49.414 --> 13:51.440
And what makes it even sweeter?
Give up?

13:51.573 --> 13:53.352
Roderick Brody is paying for it.

13:53.477 --> 13:56.116
He is footing the Bill
for his own comeuppance.

13:56.241 --> 13:58.396
And that is the best kind
of comeuppance there is.

13:58.531 --> 14:02.168
Excuse me, kind sir.
Have you seen this woman?

14:02.557 --> 14:05.591
She's cheating on a guy who used
to put my head in a toilet bowl.

14:08.676 --> 14:11.001
Mr. Monk,
don't you feel bad even a little?

14:11.126 --> 14:13.762
I mean if you're right,
this could destroy their marriage.

14:14.066 --> 14:16.573
You're the one who's
always talking about karma.

14:17.172 --> 14:20.023
What goes around comes around.
Isn't that what you said?

14:20.159 --> 14:22.547
- That isn't what I meant.
- Of course it is.

14:22.882 --> 14:24.003
Of course it is.

14:25.838 --> 14:28.007
That looks promising. Come on.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.004
Hi, excuse me.

14:35.333 --> 14:39.236
Hi, we're looking for this woman.

14:39.584 --> 14:40.608
You a cop?

14:42.215 --> 14:44.630
- Just an old friend.
- Haven't seen her.

14:52.647 --> 14:56.261
Maybe General Washington
can refresh your memory.

14:59.214 --> 15:00.480
Is that a dollar?

15:03.407 --> 15:04.527
Okay, I get it.

15:05.568 --> 15:07.925
Who knows?
Maybe there are...

15:10.244 --> 15:11.983
Two General Washingtons.

15:13.502 --> 15:16.130
Where are you going?
Where's he going?

15:19.261 --> 15:22.311
Got to admire the guy.
He's incorruptible.

15:24.327 --> 15:25.834
She's right over there.

15:28.554 --> 15:31.330
- Oh, my god. It's true.
- Oh, my god.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.580
This... is going to kill him.

15:34.709 --> 15:37.009
- He's actually kind of cute.
- Even better.

15:37.449 --> 15:40.183
All right, I get to tell him.
That's the deal.

15:40.321 --> 15:42.765
I can't wait to see his face.

15:44.433 --> 15:45.522
What is that?

15:46.831 --> 15:48.794
Is that your camera?
Where did you get that?

15:48.919 --> 15:51.667
- It was a birthday gift.
- From who? Thomas Edison?

15:51.792 --> 15:53.087
It was from my nana.

15:53.212 --> 15:56.594
- Wait, is there actual film in it?
- Of course there's film in it.

15:57.452 --> 15:59.650
I have three pictures left.

16:01.854 --> 16:04.232
There's not enough light.
So...

16:07.270 --> 16:09.356
- Is that a flash cube?
- Bingo.

16:10.359 --> 16:12.226
Hold this.
Hold it.

16:16.606 --> 16:17.861
What are you doing?

16:18.836 --> 16:21.083
It's an old private eye trick.
Hold that.

16:21.567 --> 16:23.886
I'm gonna use it as a mirror.

16:26.796 --> 16:29.507
- Hurry up. Take the picture. Take it.
- That way's too much.

16:33.859 --> 16:35.478
You like that soon?

16:37.047 --> 16:40.056
Sir, would you mind taking our picture?

16:40.269 --> 16:41.967
Madame, I would be honored.

16:42.507 --> 16:45.811
Thank you. Here you go.
It's ready to go.

16:48.332 --> 16:51.979
I got the same model myself.
A gift from my nana.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.706
Okay, sir,
if you wouldn't mind standing right...

16:56.541 --> 16:59.193
There.
Okay, can you see us?

16:59.329 --> 17:02.436
- I gotcha.
- Okay, if you could stand right there.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.513
Right? And on the count of three.

17:06.701 --> 17:09.511
One. Two. And three.

17:11.749 --> 17:12.757
Well...

17:13.366 --> 17:14.436
you're right.

17:17.672 --> 17:19.452
His name is Douglas Fendle.

17:20.131 --> 17:22.012
- Do you know him?
- Fendle? No.

17:22.137 --> 17:23.137
Are you sure?

17:23.739 --> 17:27.273
Young, strapping, good-looking guy.
Viral. You don't know him?

17:29.548 --> 17:32.589
She met him at a bar on Vinton street,
had a couple of drinks, and

17:33.122 --> 17:35.911
- he left first.
- Yeah, the viral guy left first.

17:36.319 --> 17:39.211
We followed him to the Avalon hotel
on Jackson place.

17:39.336 --> 17:42.137
- Roderick, I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, we're really, really sorry.

17:42.905 --> 17:44.145
I don't see anything.

17:46.701 --> 17:49.905
Well that film expired about
35-40 years ago. But

17:50.624 --> 17:54.571
that's her. If you want to cry,
go ahead. We understand.

17:55.709 --> 17:57.955
I can't see anything.
This doesn't prove anything.

17:59.052 --> 18:00.346
You know it's her.

18:00.664 --> 18:03.305
Right? Because you saw her
on the street. That's why you hired us.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.948
You know, to tell you the truth,
I'm not so sure about that anymore.

18:06.073 --> 18:09.849
The woman I saw, maybe she wasn't
Marilyn. My eyes aren't so great.

18:10.149 --> 18:12.912
- I could've been wrong.
- No, no, no. You weren't wrong.

18:13.257 --> 18:14.257
It was her.

18:14.868 --> 18:18.435
I'm just, I'm not convinced.
I need some real proof.

18:19.296 --> 18:22.331
You know last night was our anniversary
and Marilyn surprised me.

18:22.570 --> 18:24.927
She bought us tickets.
We're going on a cruise.

18:25.383 --> 18:27.218
Like a second honeymoon thing.

18:28.035 --> 18:29.852
I think we're in a good place.

18:30.383 --> 18:32.393
No, no. You're in a bad place.

18:33.267 --> 18:35.760
You're in heartbreak hotel.
Look at the next one.

18:37.904 --> 18:40.822
- Is that a... spoon?
- Yeah, look closer.

18:41.210 --> 18:42.563
See the reflection?

18:44.039 --> 18:46.107
See, that's them.
That's your wife.

18:46.232 --> 18:49.118
That's your beloved wife.
This is killing you.

18:49.386 --> 18:51.290
- I don't see it.
- No, it's eating you up.

18:51.415 --> 18:54.319
You know what? You're probably
right. It the bar was dark.

18:54.444 --> 18:57.546
She was across the room.
We probably have the wrong girl.

18:57.671 --> 19:01.284
- Mr. Monk, we made a mistake.
- Zip it. Zip it.

19:02.603 --> 19:04.825
This is the worst day
of your life, right?

19:05.868 --> 19:07.561
- Are you crying?
- A little bit?

19:08.197 --> 19:11.414
Adrian, i'm still gonna pay you.
If that's what you're worried about.

19:14.227 --> 19:15.120
What?

19:15.245 --> 19:17.931
The gun? Don't worry about that.
I got a permit.

19:18.169 --> 19:19.908
We live in uncertain times.

19:21.356 --> 19:22.534
For your troubles.

19:23.064 --> 19:25.677
All right, how about this?
I'll keep digging.

19:25.829 --> 19:29.365
I'll get a better camera.
I'll get a digital computer camera.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.954
So there won't be any doubt.

19:32.079 --> 19:35.020
Adrian, I appreciate it. But just forget
about it, all right? It's over.

19:35.881 --> 19:37.118
You're off the clock.

19:38.174 --> 19:39.174
Great.

19:40.005 --> 19:41.241
Great.
Great.

19:41.854 --> 19:44.231
It took you long enough.
Did you get it?

19:46.546 --> 19:47.666
Is it a good one?

19:48.712 --> 19:51.942
- Looks good. She looks happy with it.
- Yes, she does.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.466
- And she's very hard to please.
- Where's the telescope thing.

19:54.591 --> 19:56.596
It has a automatic zoom,
so it's built-in.

19:56.721 --> 19:58.812
Built-in?
Excellent.

20:01.255 --> 20:02.878
Mr. Monk, it's not heart surgery.

20:03.422 --> 20:06.649
If we leave right away,
we can be at her house by 8:00.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.018
We can follow her all day.

20:09.143 --> 20:11.929
Yeah, look, Mr. Monk, I have to tell
you something. I made a decision.

20:12.054 --> 20:15.276
If you want to keep following mrs.
Brody, I suppose that's your right.

20:15.401 --> 20:16.714
Although it really isn't.

20:16.982 --> 20:19.396
- But I can't help you anymore.
- Why not?

20:19.550 --> 20:22.763
I'm just not comfortable.
Her husband fired us.

20:23.023 --> 20:24.649
It's what they call pro bono.

20:24.879 --> 20:27.671
No, pro bono is for lawyers.
This is stalking.

20:27.796 --> 20:29.839
No, this is comeuppance.

20:30.052 --> 20:31.501
Pro bono comeuppance.

20:31.780 --> 20:34.176
No, that is just crazy talk.

20:34.522 --> 20:36.719
- It's not crazy talk.
- Pro bono comeuppance?

20:36.844 --> 20:40.800
It's craziest talk there is. You heard
what he said. He wants you to quit.

20:41.338 --> 20:42.776
I wanted him to quit!

20:43.139 --> 20:46.985
I begged him to quit 40 years
ago in stall number three.

20:50.345 --> 20:51.833
Yes, he is right here.

20:53.734 --> 20:55.670
The avalon? Sure, we know it.
We were just there.

20:56.689 --> 20:57.906
Wait, what's his name?

20:59.552 --> 21:01.777
- Oh, my god.
- What happened?

21:02.460 --> 21:04.392
His name is Douglas J. Fendle.

21:04.605 --> 21:07.523
Or, rather it was Douglas J. Fendle.

21:08.142 --> 21:11.464
I guess still is. But doesn't matter.
Let's move on.

21:11.589 --> 21:14.430
He was 37, unmarried, from Chicago.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.200
Mr. Fendle was an attorney.

21:16.424 --> 21:19.293
He worked at a small law firm.
Shellman, Reznick, and Link.

21:19.418 --> 21:22.535
Mostly family Law.
Wills, adoptions.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.581
- Hey, you okay?
- Dynamite.

21:25.945 --> 21:28.824
Are you gonna,
you know, take a look around?

21:29.160 --> 21:31.969
- Yeah, right.
- Good. Look, I talked to his boss.

21:32.146 --> 21:34.847
She said he was on vacation.
She didn't even know he was here.

21:35.782 --> 21:37.494
- Interesting.
- According to

21:37.859 --> 21:41.206
the clerk, he checked in three days ago.
Kept to himself.

21:41.595 --> 21:43.598
Housekeeping found
the body this morning.

21:43.724 --> 21:47.357
Doctor tee puts the time of death
at 8:00 or 9:00 pm last night.

21:48.425 --> 21:51.034
- He was stabbed three times.
- Ouch.

21:53.828 --> 21:56.349
There was money still in his wallet,
so it wasn't a Robbery.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.142
- Wasn't a Robbery.
- Yeah, and...

22:00.191 --> 22:02.433
there was no forced entry.
He let the guy in.

22:02.844 --> 22:04.087
I think he knew him.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.331
I think he did too!

22:06.456 --> 22:08.238
- I think you're right.
- Excuse me.

22:08.492 --> 22:12.420
Let me talk to you for a minute please.
Do you think Roderick Brody did this?

22:14.174 --> 22:17.169
- Well he said he didn't believe us.
- Apparently he reconsidered.

22:17.294 --> 22:20.299
- Well that's horrible. A man is dead.
- Yeah, I know.

22:20.424 --> 22:23.593
And that's a murder in the first degree.
And you know what that means?

22:24.413 --> 22:25.676
Prison Swirlies.

22:26.528 --> 22:30.201
Prison Swir. You don't even want
to know about prison Swirlies.

22:30.326 --> 22:32.587
They're not even
technically real swirlies.

22:32.779 --> 22:36.006
You were right about karma.
It is fantastic.

22:36.666 --> 22:40.084
Thanks for coming. I was downstairs
doing a little dumpster diving.

22:40.284 --> 22:42.158
Can't find the murder weapon.

22:42.429 --> 22:45.326
There's a steak knife missing
from that service tray.

22:45.464 --> 22:46.897
I guess he took it with him.

22:47.428 --> 22:49.494
So, what do you...

22:50.796 --> 22:52.052
What do you think?

22:55.360 --> 22:56.422
You okay?

22:59.772 --> 23:02.864
- Are you happy?
- I love my work. Is that a crime?

23:04.238 --> 23:06.747
- I think they knew the guy.
- Know wha...

23:07.554 --> 23:09.724
- What? You know this guy?
- Don't. Don't

23:09.981 --> 23:11.275
- Technically.
- know him.

23:11.411 --> 23:14.629
- Never met him face-to-face.
- Never formally introduced. Sort of.

23:15.221 --> 23:17.101
- We've been following him.
- Right.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.343
You were following him?

23:20.936 --> 23:22.086
I wonder why.

23:22.556 --> 23:25.803
Well he was seeing a woman.
A married woman. And

23:26.731 --> 23:29.475
- we were following her.
- You were following the woman.

23:32.069 --> 23:34.736
- I wonder why.
- Her husband hired us.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.658
Until you hear different, I wonder why?

23:38.835 --> 23:41.186
What? What are you doing?
You're doing divorce work now?

23:41.316 --> 23:44.048
No, he was just doing a favor.
He was an old friend of Mr. Monk's.

23:44.173 --> 23:47.722
Wouldn't exactly say he was a friend.
More of an acquaintance actually.

23:47.852 --> 23:50.251
He beat me up
every week for three years.

23:50.376 --> 23:52.507
And that would explain
the stupid grin on your face.

23:52.643 --> 23:55.325
- You think you're getting even.
- I know I'm getting even.

23:56.143 --> 23:59.061
So your pal,
you told him about the affair.

23:59.324 --> 24:01.701
And you told him that Fendle
was gonna be here.

24:03.566 --> 24:07.187
I think your pal just made the top
of my to-do list. What's his name?

24:07.312 --> 24:09.920
Actually we can't tell you that.
Technically he's a client

24:10.116 --> 24:13.562
so it's privileged information. We could
contact a lawyer or a third party.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.422
23 orchard circle.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.746
B-R-O. That looks like an A.
B-R-O-D-Y.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.880
- Roderick Brody.
- Well let's go talk to him.

24:29.585 --> 24:30.764
Prison Swirlies.

24:31.429 --> 24:34.244
Didn't have to drag me down here.
I could've talked to you at my office.

24:34.369 --> 24:36.996
Well I'm more comfortable here.
I got my own coffee mug.

24:37.121 --> 24:39.231
I got the AC set just the way I like it.

24:39.356 --> 24:41.112
Yeah, well can I at least call my wife?

24:41.237 --> 24:43.246
We've already called her.
She's on her way.

24:43.443 --> 24:46.226
So let's start at the beginning.
You knew Mr. Monk from the neighborhood.

24:46.351 --> 24:48.130
You hired him to follow your wife.

24:48.263 --> 24:51.406
He told you about Mr. Fendle.
Told you about Fendle at the hotel.

24:51.537 --> 24:53.039
Yeah, but it wasn't my wife.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.829
The woman you saw in that bar.
It wasn't Marilyn.

24:56.321 --> 24:57.461
Couldn't have been.

24:58.276 --> 25:01.007
I told you about your wife
and Mr. Fendle.

25:01.132 --> 25:04.050
And then two hours later,
Fendle was dead.

25:04.743 --> 25:06.366
It looks pretty bad, Roddy.

25:08.966 --> 25:12.753
- Skipping ahead. 8:00 last night?
- I told you.

25:13.033 --> 25:15.794
I was home... with Marilyn.
We rented a movie.

25:16.274 --> 25:19.231
What's the matter, Roddy?
You look a little flushed.

25:23.597 --> 25:24.834
- Get it?
- No.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.302
- Neither do i.
- Flushed?

25:28.695 --> 25:31.611
He gets it. Trust me.
He gets it.

25:34.932 --> 25:37.099
We'll take it from here, okay?
Thank you.

25:37.238 --> 25:40.497
I bet the room is just swirling
around you right now, isn't it?

25:40.622 --> 25:42.567
It's swirling all around.

25:43.804 --> 25:46.528
Your whole life is about
to go down the drain.

25:46.862 --> 25:48.447
Wait, I have more.

25:49.319 --> 25:51.876
- Your thoughts are overflowing.
- Just wait for Marilyn.

25:52.001 --> 25:54.325
When she gets here she tell you.
We were together all night.

25:54.450 --> 25:56.715
- I never left her side.
- I'm sorry, baby.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.007
Thank god.

25:58.205 --> 26:00.924
Marilyn, you gotta tell these
guys about what we did last night.

26:01.049 --> 26:03.429
I know, I know.
What you want me to say but I...

26:04.221 --> 26:06.168
I can't lie for you after what you did.

26:06.539 --> 26:09.612
- What?
- The truth is that I...

26:11.031 --> 26:13.653
I was in love with Doug Fendle.
Last night,

26:14.100 --> 26:17.048
I told Roderick the truth.
I tried to.

26:17.173 --> 26:20.188
- What are you talking about, Marilyn?
- Mr. Brody, let her talk.

26:20.444 --> 26:23.482
- What happened?
- He got furious.

26:23.607 --> 26:25.938
He said he was gonna kill Doug.
And then...

26:27.111 --> 26:28.155
he left.

26:28.818 --> 26:30.051
What are you doing.

26:31.123 --> 26:32.457
What time was this?

26:33.944 --> 26:35.374
7:30.

26:36.026 --> 26:39.118
He left for about, I don't know,
two hours. And when he came back,

26:41.529 --> 26:43.490
he was... Bloody.

26:44.915 --> 26:47.507
This is ridiculous!
I don't know why she's saying this.

26:47.632 --> 26:49.343
- Sit down!
- What are you doing?

26:49.488 --> 26:50.802
It's okay. Go on.

26:52.594 --> 26:56.285
When I came downstairs,
Roderick was by the fireplace.

26:56.456 --> 26:57.754
He was burning his clothes.

26:57.889 --> 26:59.681
That is totally insane!
She's lying to you!

26:59.806 --> 27:02.298
- Sit down.
- He gave me this.

27:03.139 --> 27:04.511
Told me to get rid of it.

27:11.799 --> 27:14.621
I'm going to step outside for a moment.

27:17.201 --> 27:18.573
A little fresh air.

27:33.551 --> 27:34.653
There you are.

27:36.663 --> 27:37.977
What are you doing?

27:38.745 --> 27:40.175
Listen. You hear that?

27:41.008 --> 27:43.172
Birds.
They're singing.

27:44.246 --> 27:46.970
- Is that a lark?
- I don't know.

27:47.724 --> 27:50.447
You know how I feel?
Liberated.

27:51.973 --> 27:55.683
I should've confronted that SO.
You-know-what years ago.

27:56.056 --> 27:58.165
B. I still can't believe I won.

27:58.319 --> 28:00.573
Yeah, I don't think anybody
really won anything.

28:00.698 --> 28:02.636
You're right of course. You're right.

28:02.761 --> 28:05.915
- Except me. I won big time.
- Are you gonna start singing?

28:06.098 --> 28:08.834
I could! I almost could.
You know what I am gonna do though?

28:09.534 --> 28:11.080
I'm gonna do a Cartwheel.

28:13.727 --> 28:16.065
I'm gonna do a Cartwheel right here.

28:16.190 --> 28:18.572
You might want to stand back.
It's my first Cartwheel.

28:18.954 --> 28:21.003
That's perfect.
Plenty of room there. Great.

28:22.039 --> 28:23.488
I'm gonna do it right here.

28:38.359 --> 28:40.991
What am I doing?
A man's

28:41.691 --> 28:43.967
been killed, right?
A man was stabbed to death.

28:44.092 --> 28:46.033
Yeah, that's what I've been saying.

28:46.518 --> 28:48.973
This is no time for Cartwheels.

28:51.467 --> 28:53.526
- Why don't I listen to you?
- I don't know.

28:54.969 --> 28:57.940
On the other hand, I have been
waiting 40 years for this. I mean

28:58.065 --> 29:00.439
this is a moment to savor.
It may never happen again.

29:00.564 --> 29:03.053
I'm doing the Cartwheel. I am doing it.

29:06.819 --> 29:09.892
I can't do it. It's ghoulish!
I mean...

29:10.600 --> 29:13.436
One man dead, another man
going to jail. Am I a ghoul?

29:13.572 --> 29:16.048
- No, you're not a ghoul.
- What is a ghoul?

29:16.321 --> 29:19.789
- I don't know.
- I don't care! That is my arch enemy!

29:20.006 --> 29:22.736
One Cartwheel. I gotta do it.
I can't do it.

29:22.868 --> 29:24.658
- Natalie, do the Cartwheel.
- What?

29:24.783 --> 29:28.554
Come on, it's a good compromise.
Cartwheel by proxy.

29:28.721 --> 29:31.659
And don't forget to say "wee."
Gotta say "wee!"

29:40.639 --> 29:42.050
What happened?

29:46.867 --> 29:48.007
He had a gun.

29:53.003 --> 29:54.003
And...

29:54.669 --> 29:56.348
I'm sorry, i'm so bad with names.

29:58.100 --> 30:01.212
Sorry to bother you.
Something's come up.

30:02.130 --> 30:04.927
Honestly this isn't a great time for me.
I'm in the middle of so me business.

30:05.227 --> 30:08.775
- It'll just take a minute.
- Okay. I'll be right with you.

30:13.528 --> 30:15.132
Mrs. Brody, we're all set here.

30:15.534 --> 30:17.774
It'll take me a couple days
to open the new account.

30:17.899 --> 30:21.195
Thank you so much for helping out, Eric.
Especially on such short notice.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.712
It's your money too, Marilyn.

30:22.847 --> 30:25.780
I'll have someone from the grand
cayman branch call you, okay? Afternoon.

30:31.495 --> 30:32.734
Well, it certainly

30:32.934 --> 30:35.978
does seem that Roderick could be
going to prison for quite some time.

30:38.352 --> 30:40.690
I never should've told
him about Douglas.

30:41.219 --> 30:44.374
Well I...
I knew what he was capable of and...

30:46.432 --> 30:48.999
anyway.
I'm sorry, Mr. Monk.

30:49.590 --> 30:51.937
Can I help you with something?
You had a question.

30:52.161 --> 30:54.016
Yes, right. You mentioned

30:54.652 --> 30:56.773
last night your husband was upset.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.327
- He stormed out of the house.
- That's right.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.430
What car was he driving?

31:02.816 --> 31:05.019
What car? His car.

31:05.792 --> 31:08.478
Right, so...
here's my problem, mrs. Brody.

31:08.833 --> 31:12.331
Your husband keeps a handgun
in his glove compartment. I saw it.

31:12.811 --> 31:15.293
So why a steak knife?

31:15.444 --> 31:19.058
How did he even know the steak
knife would be in the hotel room?

31:19.702 --> 31:21.903
Maybe he took the handgun
with him and then

31:22.028 --> 31:24.874
realized at the last moment
it was too loud.

31:26.053 --> 31:27.464
He changed his mind.

31:28.363 --> 31:29.484
Maybe. Maybe.

31:30.130 --> 31:32.545
I'm so sorry I can't be more helpful,
Mr. Monk.

31:33.854 --> 31:36.249
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be fine.

31:36.374 --> 31:38.298
My aunt is flying in tomorrow.

31:38.423 --> 31:41.128
I just have to take
this one day at a time.

31:42.731 --> 31:45.167
That's the way to do it.
Sorry to bother you.

32:14.822 --> 32:18.063
I have some papers for you to sign.
- Where is my husband?

32:19.608 --> 32:22.842
You've got other things to worry about.
Believe me.

32:24.143 --> 32:27.594
You know, if you don't want to sign
them, you don't have to. My signature.

32:28.103 --> 32:29.186
Close enough.

32:30.257 --> 32:31.916
A cop named Monk

32:32.283 --> 32:35.439
stopped by today.
He was smart. Too smart.

32:35.575 --> 32:38.212
We are gonna have to
accelerate our schedule.

32:38.438 --> 32:39.989
Which is too bad, because

32:40.250 --> 32:42.801
we were just getting to know each other.

32:45.715 --> 32:47.532
It's fun having a sister, isn't it?

32:59.904 --> 33:01.891
- You okay?
- Am I okay?

33:02.914 --> 33:05.253
I don't know.
I guess I'm everything.

33:06.657 --> 33:09.285
Angry. Confused. Scared.

33:10.231 --> 33:12.161
I can't get my head around this.

33:12.394 --> 33:14.859
- You think you need a lawyer?
- I got ten lawyers.

33:15.725 --> 33:18.140
Just...
I never thought i'd need 'em for this.

33:18.704 --> 33:21.007
Well, I have some news.

33:22.862 --> 33:25.793
I've decided to help you.

33:26.453 --> 33:28.466
- I thought you were helping me.
- Well,

33:29.425 --> 33:31.249
I've decided to really help you.

33:32.184 --> 33:35.715
Until now I've sort of...
been faking it.

33:37.259 --> 33:39.633
The truth is I was hoping

33:40.333 --> 33:43.281
that your wife was
cheating on you. I was...

33:43.613 --> 33:46.090
sort of... glad when you got arrested.

33:46.557 --> 33:47.672
You were glad.

33:48.550 --> 33:49.713
Well... figured

33:50.702 --> 33:53.048
- it was payback.
- For what?

33:55.431 --> 33:56.431
For what?

33:57.458 --> 33:59.076
For... for what?

34:00.193 --> 34:01.563
For seventh grade!

34:01.984 --> 34:04.966
For ruining my life! Weren't.
Weren't you listening?

34:05.091 --> 34:07.456
Are you talking about the swirlies?

34:14.041 --> 34:15.821
You used to terrorize me.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.313
- You gave as good as you got?
- What are you talking about?

34:19.438 --> 34:21.716
You didn't just roll over
like a lot of those kids.

34:21.841 --> 34:24.520
I remember. You called me names.
You hurt my feelings.

34:25.319 --> 34:28.474
- And you splashed me.
- I splashed you?

34:29.225 --> 34:30.577
But I don't dwell on it.

34:30.705 --> 34:32.770
What am I gonna do?
Hold a grudge for 30 years?

34:32.905 --> 34:35.440
- I figure we're even.
- Don't believe this. I...

34:38.050 --> 34:42.034
I cannot believe this.
You mean, you never even...

34:43.744 --> 34:45.373
do you have any idea...

34:50.943 --> 34:52.810
okay, all right, okay

34:53.426 --> 34:55.634
let's move on. Okay, let's just...

34:57.912 --> 34:59.658
- talk about your wife.
- Okay.

35:03.141 --> 35:05.180
I think she might've been
lying about last night.

35:05.305 --> 35:06.729
I know she's lying.

35:07.215 --> 35:09.799
I just can't figure out why.
I've been sitting here for two hours

35:09.924 --> 35:11.667
- Wrecking my brain.
- Racking your brain.

35:11.792 --> 35:13.265
Here's what I know, okay?

35:13.625 --> 35:14.870
I know I didn't do it.

35:15.106 --> 35:17.406
And I know she didn't do it
cause I was with her all night.

35:17.541 --> 35:18.958
Where did she get...

35:20.514 --> 35:21.549
the knife.

35:21.674 --> 35:23.845
I don't know.
Where did she get the knife?

35:24.389 --> 35:25.783
I can't figure it.

35:26.363 --> 35:28.943
Something's going on here but I...
are you okay?

35:30.487 --> 35:32.402
- That's me.
- Yeah.

35:33.356 --> 35:35.981
- It's a mirror.
- Oh, my god.

35:40.855 --> 35:43.646
- She did it.
- Who did what?

35:44.349 --> 35:46.247
Marilyn. Your wife.

35:46.841 --> 35:50.151
Last night she was at the hotel.

35:50.276 --> 35:51.436
She killed Doug Fendle.

35:51.561 --> 35:54.612
I feel like I'm in eighth grade
geometry class here I don't understand.

35:54.796 --> 35:58.043
I told you I was with her.
Was she with me or was she at the hotel?

36:00.712 --> 36:03.534
And no.
She was with you...

36:04.360 --> 36:06.972
and she was at the hotel.

36:07.884 --> 36:08.831
She was both.

36:11.077 --> 36:12.082
Twins.

36:23.112 --> 36:24.245
Hey, sis.

36:24.797 --> 36:26.056
How you feeling?

36:26.632 --> 36:30.029
Those are some pretty strong
tranquilizers I gave you.

36:30.214 --> 36:31.214
You know,

36:31.594 --> 36:35.273
I didn't even know
I had a sister until that.

36:35.398 --> 36:38.287
That lawyer Doug Fendle came knocking.

36:38.868 --> 36:40.878
His firm represented our adoption

36:41.003 --> 36:43.536
35 years ago. Can you believe that?

36:44.226 --> 36:47.055
And now...
you're worth what?

36:48.358 --> 36:51.419
$9-10 million?

36:53.500 --> 36:55.392
I never even had a savings account.

36:56.404 --> 36:58.046
Doesn't really seem fair, does it?

37:10.034 --> 37:12.761
You were right. She has a twin sister.
A patrice Gesner.

37:12.886 --> 37:16.132
They were adopted by different
families 35 years ago in Milwaukee.

37:16.257 --> 37:18.291
Papers were sealed.
They never knew each other.

37:18.416 --> 37:20.213
- I think they both in there.
- Look around?

37:20.349 --> 37:23.450
Not yet. Rodriquez is getting a warrant.
He'll be here soon.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.864
So identical twins?
That's one for the books.

37:25.999 --> 37:28.870
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure I said twins.
- Randy, you always say twins.

37:30.569 --> 37:33.448
You've been depressed.
And you've been drinking.

37:33.878 --> 37:35.653
They're gonna find your body

37:36.100 --> 37:38.361
in the bay near the bridge.

37:39.011 --> 37:41.291
The bay is salt water
so I have to add this.

37:41.945 --> 37:44.804
- So how did you know?
- Little things. They began to add up.

37:45.075 --> 37:47.973
When I first met her,
she mentioned her aunt in Texas.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.701
Just one aunt in Texas.
She didn't even make it.

37:50.826 --> 37:53.808
She pronounced it "ant."
This morning, she said:

37:53.934 --> 37:56.822
My aunt is flying in tomorrow.

37:56.953 --> 37:59.859
And the fingernails.
Two days ago, she was biting them.

38:00.230 --> 38:03.111
This morning they were long
and perfectly manicured.

38:03.236 --> 38:05.110
It's time for your bath, sis.

38:07.572 --> 38:08.915
This might hurt a little.

38:11.628 --> 38:14.489
I wonder if I'll feel it.
Probably not.

38:15.022 --> 38:18.404
It's not like you felt my pain
for the last 35 years.

38:19.946 --> 38:23.501
Roderick's wife wasn't cheating on him.
The woman saw last week was her sister.

38:23.628 --> 38:26.802
Yeah, we weren't following Marilyn.
We were following her twin.

38:28.582 --> 38:32.235
This morning while we were all at
the police station, the sister was here.

38:32.388 --> 38:34.451
She was switching places.

38:36.179 --> 38:38.741
She was gonna Kill Roderick too
to get him out of the way

38:38.866 --> 38:42.296
until we arrested him.
We just made her job easier.

38:43.631 --> 38:44.635
Arrested?

38:47.620 --> 38:48.914
I'll be right there.

38:51.385 --> 38:54.699
- Okay, why did she kill Fendle?
- Fendle was her partner in all this.

38:54.824 --> 38:57.804
- But she didn't want to cut him in.
- There was a banker here this morning.

38:57.929 --> 39:00.499
She's been moving Roderick's
money to offshore accounts.

39:00.631 --> 39:04.267
Funny thing is you probably
don't even know my name.

39:05.198 --> 39:06.252
It's Patrice.

39:06.377 --> 39:09.353
I think she's planning to kill Marilyn
and then disappear.

39:09.639 --> 39:13.265
Patrice, I beg you.
I'm begging you. Please, no!

39:19.103 --> 39:20.920
It could be going down right now.

39:21.672 --> 39:23.333
Where the heck is the warrant?

39:28.348 --> 39:29.348
Help!

39:29.541 --> 39:31.898
- What was that?
- Probable cause!

39:33.293 --> 39:35.186
Help! Somebody help!

39:43.972 --> 39:45.847
Step away from her now! Now!

39:49.550 --> 39:51.308
It's okay.
It's okay.

39:55.053 --> 39:56.464
How do we tell'em apart?

39:58.447 --> 39:59.452
Say aunt.

40:00.262 --> 40:02.436
Let's arrest the one
that wasn't drowning.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.154
Yeah. Yeah, that works too.

40:28.967 --> 40:31.257
- Hope he has the right sister.
- I can't look.

40:31.763 --> 40:35.277
This is the worst comeuppance ever.
You lied to me.

40:35.776 --> 40:37.148
- About what?
- Karma.

40:37.358 --> 40:38.943
You're blaming me for this?

40:39.863 --> 40:40.907
Yes, I am.

40:42.781 --> 40:45.910
I just want to say thanks.
You saved my family.

40:46.992 --> 40:48.054
Saved my life.

40:48.687 --> 40:49.862
Glad I could help.

40:50.098 --> 40:52.127
Yeah, and hey, about this swirly thing.

40:52.661 --> 40:54.053
No hard feelings, right?

40:55.043 --> 40:57.662
All right.
I'll see you around.

40:58.130 --> 41:00.024
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

41:00.162 --> 41:01.399
What's a swirly?

41:01.534 --> 41:05.225
We used to fool around back in the day.
You know, horseplay after school.

41:05.974 --> 41:08.146
He was a funny kid. He used to

41:08.545 --> 41:10.673
wash his hands, like, ten times a day.

41:11.516 --> 41:12.824
Listen. Do you hear that?

41:13.327 --> 41:16.322
- What? The birds?
- Not the birds. Don't you hear that?

41:17.838 --> 41:19.790
The toilet tank refilling.

41:22.195 --> 41:23.520
Toilet tank of life.

41:23.645 --> 41:25.768
Come on, Mr. Monk. I'll drive you home.

41:25.893 --> 41:29.599
It's what plato called
the great cosmic swirly.

41:29.854 --> 41:32.215
- There's no escaping it.
- Plato said that?

41:32.360 --> 41:33.480
I'm paraphrasing.

41:33.776 --> 41:35.709
I'm gonna need that shower cap back.

00:00.500 --> 00:10.000
