WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:06.774
( theme music playing )

00:14.182 --> 00:17.618
IF SAMMI DOESN'T WANT TO
TAKE CLARINET ANYMORE,
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.188
- I DON'T WANNA PUSH HER.
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
PUSHED IT, NOT ME.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.656
- GOD, WHERE'S THE TISSUES?
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.259
I'M HAVING
AN ALLERGY ATTACK.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.064
WHAT IS THIS?

00:31.632 --> 00:34.768
WHAT IS THIS, JEFF?
WHOSE PANTIES ARE THESE?

00:34.868 --> 00:37.205
- UH...
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?

00:37.305 --> 00:39.107
IT'S YOUR CAR.
WHAT ARE THESE
DOING IN THERE?

00:39.207 --> 00:41.542
ALL RIGHT,
PULL THE FUCK OVER.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.744
PULL OVER.

00:47.115 --> 00:48.749
I REALLY HATE
SHOPPING FOR PANTS.

00:48.849 --> 00:52.653
- SERIOUSLY, WHAT'S WORSE
THAN TRYING ON PANTS?
- EXACTLY.

00:52.753 --> 00:55.089
I THINK THOSE
ARE GONNA LOOK GREAT
ONCE THEY'RE HEMMED.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.158
- HOW DO THEY FEEL?
- GOOD.

00:57.258 --> 01:00.561
- ALL RIGHT.
- ( ALARM BLARING )

01:00.661 --> 01:02.630
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING--
WHAT'S-- WHAT'S THIS?

01:02.730 --> 01:05.299
IT'S THE FIRE ALARM.
YEAH, WE NEED TO LEAVE.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.000
BUT I LEFT MY PANTS
IN THE DRESSING ROOM.

01:07.101 --> 01:09.270
JESUS.

01:13.241 --> 01:16.110
HEY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:16.210 --> 01:18.112
FIRE ALARM.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.648
- THAT'S IT?
- YEAH, GOTTA BE THOROUGH.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.817
- IS THAT YOUR NAME?
- YEAH.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.153
- KRUPKE?
- MM-HMM.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.955
- REALLY?
- YEAH, MATT KRUPKE.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.891
- YOU'RE OFFICER KRUPKE.
- I AM.

01:30.991 --> 01:32.326
FAMILIAR WITH
"WEST SIDE STORY"?

01:32.426 --> 01:34.695
- NO, SIR.
- WHAT?

01:34.795 --> 01:38.065
THERE'S A CHARACTER
IN "WEST SIDE STORY"
NAMED OFFICER KRUPKE.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.434
- OKAY.
- YOU'RE OFFICER KRUPKE.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.636
- YOU NEVER HEARD
THE SONG?
- NO, SIR.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.173
* OH, OFFICER KRUPKE,
WHAT ARE WE TO DO? *

01:45.273 --> 01:47.341
* GEE, OFFICER KRUPKE,
KRUP YOU. *

01:47.441 --> 01:49.076
- YOU NEVER HEARD THAT?
- NO.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.578
- NO?
- NO.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.446
BY THE WAY, THEY WANTED
TO SAY "FUCK YOU."

01:52.546 --> 01:54.148
BUT IN THE '50s
ON BROADWAY,

01:54.248 --> 01:56.284
SONDHEIM, HE COULDN'T
WRITE "FUCK YOU."

01:56.384 --> 01:58.386
SO "KRUP YOU"
IS A SUBSTITUTE
FOR "FUCK YOU."

01:58.486 --> 02:01.088
- MMM.
- HAS ANYBODY EVER
SAID "KRUP YOU"?

02:01.189 --> 02:02.590
- NO.
- HUH.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.925
SOME GUY TOLD ME TO GO
FUCK MY FACE ONCE.

02:05.025 --> 02:07.461
HE WENT TO JAIL.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.929
OKAY.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.864
HOW MUCH LONGER?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.133
- AN HOUR, MAYBE TWO.
- REALLY?

02:13.234 --> 02:15.135
IF TECH WANTS
TO GET IN THERE,
IT COULD BE TWO HOURS.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.338
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I'M NOT GONNA WAIT
THAT LONG.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.640
- OKAY, THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.611
* DEAR KINDLY SERGEANT KRUPKE,
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND *

02:23.711 --> 02:26.514
* IT'S JUST OUR BRINGIN' UPKE
THAT GETS US OUTTA HAND *

02:26.614 --> 02:29.283
* OUR MOTHERS ALL ARE JUNKIES,
OUR FATHERS ALL ARE DRUNKS *

02:29.383 --> 02:32.186
* GOLLY, MOSES,
NATURALLY WE'RE PUNKS *

02:32.286 --> 02:35.756
* GEE, OFFICER KRUPKE,
WE'RE VERY UPSET... *

02:43.063 --> 02:44.465
( WHISPERING )
HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.235
COME HERE.
COME HERE, SHH.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.902
I GOT IN A LOT
OF TROUBLE WITH SUSIE.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.839
I NEED YOUR HELP
SO BAD.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.941
SHE FOUND
A PAIR OF PANTIES

02:54.041 --> 02:55.476
IN MY GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.778
OY VEY IZ MIR.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

02:57.878 --> 03:00.214
- NO, I AM NOT KIDDING YOU.
- HOW THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT?

03:00.314 --> 03:02.383
I FORGET THEY WERE
EVEN IN THERE.
I FORGOT--

03:02.483 --> 03:04.352
- BUT HERE'S WHERE
I NEED YOUR HELP.
- MAN, OH MAN.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.854
I TOLD HER THEY WERE
YOUR PANTIES.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.259
- SO YOU'RE GOOD?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THEY'RE MY PANTIES?

03:11.359 --> 03:13.060
NO NO, I TOLD HER THAT
THEY'RE YOUR PANTIES,

03:13.160 --> 03:16.264
THAT YOU LIKE WEARING
WOMEN'S PANTIES.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.533
- WHAT?
- YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I TOLD HER.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.669
I TOLD HER YOU LIKE
WEARING WOMEN'S PANTIES.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.571
WHERE THE FUCK DID
YOU COME UP WITH THAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

03:23.671 --> 03:25.639
I THINK IT'S PRETTY
BRILLIANT, ACTUALLY.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.341
YOU'RE GONNA COVER
FOR ME, RIGHT?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.277
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE?
YOU'RE GONNA COVER FOR ME?

03:29.377 --> 03:31.279
THEY'RE YOUR PANTIES,
RIGHT?

03:31.379 --> 03:33.046
I-I CAN'T--
I CAN'T GO IN THERE.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.982
- WHY NOT?
- I'M EMBARRASSED.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.351
- NOTHING TO BE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT.
- I'VE GOT PANTIES ON.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.053
- ONLY SHE KNOWS.
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO ACT NOW?

03:40.153 --> 03:41.722
NORMAL.
PANTIES UP HERE, NOT--

03:41.822 --> 03:43.223
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO REALLY WEAR THEM.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.725
YOU JUST KNOW
YOU'VE GOT THEM ON

03:44.825 --> 03:47.395
AND MAYBE YOU'RE A LITTLE
MORE COMFORTABLE THAN NORMAL.

03:47.495 --> 03:50.531
A LITTLE MORE AT EASE.
MAYBE A LITTLE--
LITTLE KINDER.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.533
- HELP ME PLEASE.
- THIS IS REALLY ODD.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.803
- BUT WE'RE PALS.
I WOULD DO IT FOR YOU.
- THIS IS VERY ODD.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.938
ODD YET BRILLIANT.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.840
COMPLETELY
AND UTTERLY BRILLIANT.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.476
MY BEST ONE EVER MAYBE.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.314
- ALL RIGHT.
- YOU'RE A FRIEND.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.449
YOU'RE A FUCKING FRIEND.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.851
THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU.
COME ON.

04:12.185 --> 04:14.054
Susie:
GOD.

04:14.154 --> 04:15.989
Virginia:
YEAH, I BET,
EXACTLY.

04:16.089 --> 04:20.027
WELL, IS THE ARCHITECTURE
NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

04:20.127 --> 04:21.862
- HEY, LARRY.
- OH, HEY, JEFF.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.333
- Larry: HI, HEY.
- Dennis: HELLO HELLO HELLO.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.435
HEY, VIRGINIA, HI.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.437
- DENNIS, HELLO.
- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.
IT'S A PLEASURE.

04:29.537 --> 04:32.373
- HOW'S THE GOLF GAME?
- GOOD GOOD, YEAH.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.075
LARRY, YOU HAVE
A SECURITY TAG
ON YOUR PANTS.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.844
- OH, YEAH.
- ( Virginia laughs )

04:36.944 --> 04:38.145
THAT'S WEIRD.
WHY?

04:38.245 --> 04:40.814
WELL, VIRGINIA,
IF YOU MUST KNOW,

04:40.914 --> 04:43.584
I WAS AT BANANA REPUBLIC
AND A FIRE ALARM WENT OFF.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.686
- Virginia: UH-HUH.
- AND I WAS JUST WAITING

04:45.786 --> 04:48.221
AND THE STORE DIDN'T
OPEN BACK UP, SO I JUST
THOUGHT I'D TAKE OFF.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.223
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT WAS AMAZING,

04:50.324 --> 04:51.992
WHEN I WAS OUTSIDE
THE STORE,

04:52.092 --> 04:54.862
I WAS TALKING
TO AN OFFICER

04:54.962 --> 04:56.163
AND HIS NAME
WAS KRUPKE.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.832
- UH-HUH.
- AND HE'D NEVER HEARD

04:58.932 --> 05:00.668
OF THE CHARACTER
FROM "WEST SIDE STORY."

05:00.768 --> 05:03.136
- ISN'T THAT UNBELIEVABLE?
- UNBELIEVABLE.

05:03.236 --> 05:04.505
YEAH, I HAD TO SING
THE SONG FOR HIM.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.006
* WE'RE DISTURBED,
WE'RE DISTURBED *

05:06.106 --> 05:07.508
* WE'RE THE MOST
DISTURBED *

05:07.608 --> 05:09.009
* LIKE WE'RE
PSYCHOLOGICALLY-- *

05:09.109 --> 05:11.345
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
ENOUGH ENOUGH.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.113
I KNOW ALL THE LYRICS
FROM "WEST SIDE STORY."

05:13.213 --> 05:15.048
- REALLY?
FASCINATING.
- YEAH.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.218
- Virginia: AMAZING.
- I KNOW THE WHOLE THING.
IT'S INTERESTING.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.887
SOMETIMES YOU THINK
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY,

05:19.987 --> 05:22.923
BUT YOU REALLY DON'T
KNOW THEM AT ALL.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.259
HEY, LARRY,
I'M AUDITIONING
FOR THE REUNION SHOW,

05:26.360 --> 05:28.061
FOR THE "SEINFELD"
REUNION SHOW TOMORROW

05:28.161 --> 05:30.230
FOR THE PART
OF GEORGE'S EX-WIFE.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.099
Dennis:
SHE'D BE GREAT.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.702
- DON'T YOU THINK
SHE'D BE GREAT?
- I REALLY HOPE I GET IT.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.004
HUH, OKAY.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.372
SO BEFORE
LARRY WALKED IN,

05:38.472 --> 05:40.040
YOU WERE TELLING ME
THE STORY OF HOW YOU MET.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.542
GO AHEAD.
I WANNA HEAR.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.043
- IT WAS GREAT.
- Larry: ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.978
- I WAS BUILDING
THIS STRIP MALL--
- HOLD IT A SEC.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.080
I REALLY HAVE
A HARD TIME

05:47.180 --> 05:48.616
WITH "HOW WE MET"
STORIES, OKAY?

05:48.716 --> 05:50.484
- SO I'M GONNA--
- WELL, I WANNA HEAR IT.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.420
- WE DON'T HAVE TO TELL IT.
- Larry: NO, YOU CAN HEAR IT.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.087
I FIND IT CLOYING
AND ANNOYING.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.556
WELL, FINE.
I WANNA HEAR IT.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.391
THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE,
I WANNA HEAR IT.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.326
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TAKE A WALK AROUND
THE BLOCK, OKAY?

05:59.427 --> 06:01.562
BY THE TIME YOU'RE BACK,
THEY'LL BE FINISHED.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.163
- OKAY, FINE.
- FINE, BYE.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.632
- BYE.
- ALL RIGHT, SO?

06:04.732 --> 06:06.667
I WAS BUILDING
A STRIP MALL
IN HESPERIA--

06:06.767 --> 06:08.469
LET ME GUESS
HOW IT ENDS.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.338
- YOU GET TOGETHER
IN-- IN THE END?
- BYE, LARRY.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.842
- SO YOU WERE THE ARCHITECT...
- AND SHE WAS INTO REAL ESTAT.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.980
- LEMONADE.
- MISTER, COME HERE.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.215
- WE HAVE THE BEST LEMONADE.
- YOU WANNA BUY SOME LEMONADE?

06:22.315 --> 06:24.217
HI, SELLING
LEMONADE, HUH?

06:24.317 --> 06:26.286
- YEP.
- GOOD FOR YOU.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.955
GOOD FOR YOU.
YOU'RE ENTREPRENEURS.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.157
HEY, MISTER, DID YOU
STEAL THOSE PANTS?

06:30.257 --> 06:31.759
NO NO NO, I--
I DIDN'T STEAL THEM.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.227
AN ALARM WENT OFF
IN THE STORE AND I
HAD TO LEAVE THE STORE.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.229
I MEAN, DON'T THEY
WANT YOUR PANTS BACK?

06:36.329 --> 06:39.166
I HAVE TO BRING THEM
BACK AND I'M GOING TO,
BUT I DIDN'T STEAL.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.468
ANYWAY, I'LL HAVE
SOME LEMONADE.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.135
- HOW MUCH IS IT?
- A BUCK.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.804
A BUCK?
FINE.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.707
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HERE YOU GO.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.480
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

06:52.580 --> 06:54.314
OH MY GOD.
THIS IS AWFUL.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.584
I'M NOT EVEN JOKING.
WHO MADE THAT?

06:56.684 --> 06:58.218
- US. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- YOU MADE IT?

06:58.318 --> 06:59.853
- GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK.
- Kids: NO.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.822
- Girl: YOU CAN'T.
- I WANT MY DOLLAR BACK.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.857
JUST GET OUT OF HERE
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.059
FINE, I'LL GET OUT.
IT'S TERRIBLE.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.394
- YOU STINK.
- YOU STINK!

07:07.495 --> 07:08.729
I'M GONNA REPORT
YOU GUYS FOR THAT.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.030
- Boy: GO AHEAD!
- I'M GOING TO.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.565
- Boy: TURD!
- Girl: LOSER!

07:11.665 --> 07:16.069
- BALD ASSHOLE!
- Girl: GET OUTTA HERE!
MOM!

07:17.104 --> 07:19.072
( knocking )

07:19.172 --> 07:21.208
COULDN'T STAND ANOTHER
"HOW WE MET" STORY?

07:21.308 --> 07:22.910
- IS THAT IT?
- NO, I COULDN'T.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.278
OH, GOD.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.014
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.949
WHAT?
I'M NOT LOOKING
AT ANYTHING.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.184
- WHAT ARE YOU, SELF-CONSCIOUS?
- NO, YOU'RE LOOKING ME OVER.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.221
- I WAS NOT LOOKING
You over, paranoid.
- ( knocking )

07:34.321 --> 07:37.357
DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.292
- HI.
- HI, SUSIE.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.562
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

07:41.662 --> 07:44.498
ARE YOU THE GENTLEMAN
WHO WAS JUST TALKING

07:44.598 --> 07:47.000
TO MY KIDS OUT THERE
BY THE LEMONADE STAND?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.837
I WAS BY THE LEMONADE STAND
TALKING TO SOME YOUNGSTERS.

07:49.937 --> 07:53.373
BECAUSE APPARENTLY
SOME GUY CAME OVER

07:53.473 --> 07:54.975
AND STARTED MAKING FUN
OF THEIR LEMONADE.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.611
- YEAH?
- WAS THAT YOU, PERCHANCE?

07:57.711 --> 08:00.447
- GUILTY.
- WHAT-- WHAT'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

08:00.548 --> 08:02.182
I THINK THEY DESERVE
AN ADULT CRITIQUE.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.718
IF THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE
A DOLLAR AND GIVE YOU
THIS MUCH LEMONADE...

08:04.818 --> 08:06.654
I FELT A LITTLE
RIPPED OFF.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.822
- YOU KNEW IT WAS
KIDS AT A STAND...
- RIGHT, IT'S KIDS.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.991
...SELLING LEMONADE.
YOUR CHOICE.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.927
THE STAND NEEDS
A LITTLE SUPERVISION,
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.063
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'RE IN THAT
LITTLE KID BUBBLE.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.199
THEY'RE BUDS,
AND YOU JUST-- YOU KNOW,
JUST PISS ALL OVER IT.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.468
I DIDN'T PISS
ON THE BUDS.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.336
NO, I HELPED THE BUDS.
I'M HELPING THE BUDS GROW.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.873
- I'M GOOD FOR BUDS.
- STAY AWAY FROM
THE BUDS, LARRY.

08:25.973 --> 08:29.476
- MAY I BE EXCUSED?
- Susie: GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.945
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.
YEAH, YOU.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.582
YOU TALK TO MY KIDS AGAIN,
CALLING THE COPS.

08:34.682 --> 08:37.017
DULY NOTED.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.793
HI.
VIRGINIA SLOAN.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.561
- PLEASE SIGN IN.
- OKAY.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.397
- VIRGINIA.
- CHERYL.

08:50.497 --> 08:51.732
OH MY GOD.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.466
YOU'RE AUDITIONING?

08:53.567 --> 08:54.935
YEAH.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.137
FOR THE SAME PART,
HOW STRANGE.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.873
- OH MY GOD, ARE YOU
HERE FOR AMANDA?
- YEAH, I AM.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.675
- HMM.
- THAT IS SO WEIRD.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.678
WHY WOULD YOU
HAVE TO AUDITION?
IT'S BASED ON YOU.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.014
WELL, YOU KNOW,

09:07.114 --> 09:09.149
I THINK IT'S A PART--
PART OF THE PROCESS THAT--

09:09.249 --> 09:11.351
- I DON'T KNOW.
- THAT'S WEIRD THAT
HE WOULD MAKE YOU.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.020
LARRY WAS
EXPLAINING IT TO ME.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.689
- HEY, HOW'S DENNIS?
- HE'S REALLY GOOD.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.090
- IS HE?
- HE'S REALLY GOOD, YEAH.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.692
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I'M MEETING HIM

09:18.792 --> 09:21.261
FOR LUNCH LATER TODAY.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.997
- DO YOU WANT
TO MAYBE JOIN US?
- I WOULD LOVE TO.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.366
- YEAH?
- YEAH, CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.702
- I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU IN FOREVER.
- THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.771
- I HATE AUDITIONING.
- Mark: CHERYL, YOU'RE NEXT.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.740
- OKAY, I'M NEXT.
- GOOD LUCK.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.675
- GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
- YOU DON'T NEED ANY LUCK.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.845
- YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.
- WELL, WHO KNOWS?

09:37.945 --> 09:40.513
CHERYL'S HERE
TO READ FOR AMANDA.

09:40.614 --> 09:41.915
- Jerry: OH.
- HI.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.417
- Jerry: HI, CHERYL.
- HEY.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.919
- THIS IS...
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.420
- HEY, I'M GOOD.
- WHY DON'T YOU GO?

09:47.520 --> 09:48.722
- GO AHEAD.
- OKAY.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.423
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:50.523 --> 09:51.825
- HEY.
- HEY, LARRY.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.795
THIS IS WEIRD.
OH MY GOD.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.797
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THAT?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.666
OH...

09:58.766 --> 10:00.100
WELL, I WAS IN
A STORE YESTERDAY.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.269
I WAS GOING TO--
I WAS JUST TRYING THESE ON

10:02.369 --> 10:04.437
AND THEN AN ALARM
WENT OFF.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.373
WE ALL WENT OUT
OF THE STORE,

10:06.473 --> 10:08.208
AND I DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE WAITING AROUND.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.777
SO I'M GONNA
RETURN THEM TODAY.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.945
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST WEAR
YOUR OWN PANTS TODAY?

10:12.045 --> 10:14.782
'CAUSE THEN I'D HAVE
TO CARRY THESE AROUND.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.383
NOW I DON'T HAVE
TO CARRY ANYTHING.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.752
HE WEARS THE PANTS
INSTEAD OF CARRYING
THE PANTS.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.620
- THAT'S SMART.
- YEAH.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.255
- SHALL WE
GET STARTED?
- YES.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.224
WHY HOLD A HAT
WHEN YOU COULD JUST
PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD?

10:24.324 --> 10:25.993
- WEAR A HAT.
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.828
BUT IT'S NOT A HAT,
IT'S A PAIR OF PANTS
WITH A SECURITY--

10:27.928 --> 10:29.429
- SO WHAT?
- OKAY.

10:29.529 --> 10:32.432
AND SO,
I'M ON AN AIRPLANE
AND I'M ON THE PHONE.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.567
- RIGHT.
- AHEM, ANYTIME?

10:34.668 --> 10:36.136
READY? HELLO?

10:36.236 --> 10:38.071
GEORGE?
OH MY GOD.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.973
HONEY, YOU COULDN'T
CALL AT A WORSE TIME.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.842
- I GOT THE TIVO GUY HERE.
- OH MY GOD, GEORGE,

10:41.942 --> 10:43.844
WE'RE GOING THROUGH
A REALLY BIG STORM
RIGHT NOW.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.478
HOLD ON, HONEY. WHAT?
YOU NEED THE WARRANTY?

10:45.578 --> 10:47.114
HONEY, LET ME
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.249
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE WARRANTY CARD IS
ON THE TIVO?

10:49.349 --> 10:51.018
NO NO, I DON'T.
I--

10:51.118 --> 10:52.920
HEY, IN CASE SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO ME--

10:53.020 --> 10:54.788
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
BAD UP HERE--

10:54.888 --> 10:56.924
- IS IT IN THE KITCHEN
DRAWER BY ANY CHANCE?
- WHAT?

10:57.024 --> 10:58.692
I'M SORRY,
CAN'T HEAR YOU.
WHAT IS THAT?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.027
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

11:00.127 --> 11:02.129
GEORGE, I JUST WANNA
TELL YOU IN CASE--

11:02.229 --> 11:04.431
NO, NOT YOU,
HONEY, THE TIVO GUY.
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

11:04.531 --> 11:07.367
Cheryl:
FOR SOME REASON
IF I DON'T MAKE IT--

11:07.467 --> 11:08.869
THE TIVO GUY
WANTS TO KNOW
THE NAME OF THE GUY

11:08.969 --> 11:10.904
WHO INSTALLED
THIS THING.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.206
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.
- ( Larry laughing )

11:13.306 --> 11:16.009
- WAS IT TOM OR SOMETHING?
- I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW--

11:16.109 --> 11:18.712
OR DON,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
MAYBE BILL OR JAMES?

11:18.812 --> 11:20.380
- OH MY GOD.
- WAIT WAIT, DON'T GO.

11:20.480 --> 11:22.015
- WHAT?
- NO. OH, JEEZ.
HONEY, NO, I'M SORRY.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.484
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE TIVO GUY'S GONNA GO.

11:24.584 --> 11:28.155
- I'M NEVER GONNA
GET HIM AGAIN.
- IT'S JUST A TIVO GUY.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.957
Mark:
HONEY, CALL ME BACK
IN 10 MINUTES, OKAY?

11:30.057 --> 11:32.525
- WHAT?
- I'M SORRY, SWEETHEART.
I LOVE YOU.

11:32.625 --> 11:36.096
GEORGE. GEORGE!

11:36.196 --> 11:38.531
- Mark: NICE.
- THAT'S IT.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.433
- Mark: GREAT.
- VERY GOOD.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.870
AW, IT'S A LITTLE
NERVE-RACKING IN HERE
WITH YOU GUYS.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.504
- THAT WAS GREAT.
- IT'S THE SAME
FOR EVERYBODY.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.073
- THAT WAS GREAT.
- YEAH.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.308
- OKAY.
- Mark: I THINK
YOU DID GREAT.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.377
- THANK YOU.
- THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
YOU'RE FUNNY.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.745
- ALL RIGHT.
- GREAT WORK.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.280
- THANK YOU, MARK.
- THANKS FOR COMING IN.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.615
- THANKS, GUYS.
SO WE'LL TALK LATER?
- YEAH.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.384
- JUST A FORMALITY,
RIGHT?
- YEAH.

11:57.484 --> 11:58.986
OKAY. UH--

11:59.086 --> 12:00.788
- WELL DONE, CHERYL.
- THANKS, JERRY.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.190
- I'LL SEE YOU.
- Jerry: FANTASTIC.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.058
- THANKS, CHERYL.
- THANK YOU, MARK.

12:05.158 --> 12:06.960
- GOOD TO SEE YOU. BYE.
- OKAY, THANKS.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.262
- SHE'S PRETTY GOOD.
- PRETTY GOOD?

12:09.362 --> 12:11.598
- YEAH, SHE'S PRETTY GOOD.
- THAT WAS INSANE, OKAY?

12:11.698 --> 12:13.733
I MEAN, THAT WAS--
THAT WAS PERFECT.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.535
- PERFECT.
- YEAH, SHE WAS GOOD.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.071
- REALLY NATURAL.
NICE SOLID READING.
- EVERYTHING WE WANT.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.108
I KNEW SHE WAS GOOD,
NEVER KNEW SHE WAS
THAT GOOD.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.844
I MEAN, SHE WAS GREAT.
THAT WAS A GREAT AUDITION.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.179
- Larry: GREAT.
- SHOULD WE MOVE ON?

12:26.279 --> 12:28.615
I THINK WE CAN
CLOSE UP SHOP,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.217
WELL, I THINK
WE SHOULD SEE
EVERYBODY.

12:30.317 --> 12:34.121
I KNOW, BUT, YOU KNOW,
NO ONE'S GONNA BEAT THAT.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.323
HONEY, IN CASE
SOMETHING HAPPENS
TO ME--

12:36.423 --> 12:37.991
I MEAN,
IT'S REALLY BAD.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.127
- IS IT IN THE KITCHEN
DRAWER BY ANY CHANCE?
- WHAT?

12:40.227 --> 12:41.995
I'M SORRY,
CAN'T HEAR YOU.
WHAT IS THAT?

12:42.095 --> 12:44.231
GEORGE, I JUST WANNA
TELL YOU JUST IN CASE--

12:44.331 --> 12:46.033
Mark:
NO, NOT YOU, HONEY,
THE TIVO GUY.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.201
FOR SOME REASON
I DON'T MAKE IT HOME--

12:48.301 --> 12:49.769
THE TIVO GUY
WANTS TO KNOW
THE NAME OF THE GUY

12:49.870 --> 12:51.271
WHO INSTALLED
THIS THING.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.073
UGH, I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.375
Mark:
WAS IT TOM
OR SOMETHING?

12:55.475 --> 12:58.411
- I JUST-- I NEED YOU--
- OR DON, SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

12:58.511 --> 12:59.847
MAYBE BILL OR JAMES?

12:59.947 --> 13:01.148
OH, NO NO.
JEEZ, HONEY,
I'M SORRY.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.083
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE TIVO GUY'S GONNA GO.

13:03.183 --> 13:06.086
- I'M NEVER GONNA
GET HIM AGAIN.
- IT IS JUST A TIVO GUY.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.288
Mark:
HONEY, CALL ME BACK
IN 10 MINUTES, OKAY?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.657
- Virginia: WHAT?
- I'M SORRY, SWEETHEART.
I LOVE YOU.

13:10.757 --> 13:13.093
GEORGE!

13:15.262 --> 13:16.763
- THAT WAS GREAT.
- REALLY GOOD.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.098
- REALLY GREAT.
- NO, IT WASN'T.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.900
Jerry:
REALLY GREAT, VIRGINIA.
THANK YOU.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.835
- UGH, I HOPE IT WAS OKAY.
- Mark: IT WAS GREAT.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.503
I'M TERRIBLE
AT AUDITIONING.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.805
- NO NO.
- IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.640
Jerry:
THANK YOU.
A PLEASURE.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.343
- IT WAS REALLY
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.846
- BYE.
- BYE.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.147
SEE YOU LATER.
GREAT JOB.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.383
- THANKS. SEE YOU.
- BYE.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.152
- WOW.
- NICE.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.121
YOU CAN SEE
WHY SHE'S GOTTEN
SO MUCH WORK.

13:41.221 --> 13:44.724
- YEAH, SHE'S TERRIFIC.
- THAT WAS LIKE, "HELLO, PRO."

13:44.824 --> 13:46.159
YOU KNOW, SHE--
SHE WAS GOOD.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.561
SHE WAS GOOD,
BUT HONESTLY--

13:48.661 --> 13:51.164
I KNOW PROBABLY
YOU THINK

13:51.264 --> 13:53.033
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO BE OBJECTIVE HERE,

13:53.133 --> 13:54.667
BUT I THOUGHT
CHERYL WAS BETTER.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.236
I MEAN,
THIS IS CHERYL,
THIS PART.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.972
SHE WAS ON THAT PLANE.
SHE LIVED THIS PART.
THAT WAS HER.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.308
WHO CARES WHO WAS
ON THE PLANE?

14:01.408 --> 14:03.977
IT'S NOT A REAL PLANE.
IT'S NOT A REAL SHOW.
IT'S NOT A REAL STORY.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.913
YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE SHOOT THIS,

14:06.013 --> 14:07.580
THEY'RE GONNA CUT
THE PLANE IN HALF.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.116
IT'S NOT EVEN GONNA
BE A WHOLE PLANE.

14:09.216 --> 14:12.285
I BELIEVED CHERYL MORE
THAN I BELIEVED VIRGINIA.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.922
WELL, A GIRL LIKE THAT,
IF YOU CAN GET HER,

14:15.022 --> 14:16.623
IT'S LIKE
"LET'S GET ON BOARD

14:16.723 --> 14:18.625
THE VIRGINIA SLOAN,
TOOT TOOT.

14:18.725 --> 14:19.960
NEXT STOP, COMEDY TOWN.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.429
- WELL...
- Jerry: SO IT'S-- IT'S...

14:22.529 --> 14:25.298
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU.
WE'RE AT LOGGERHEADS HERE.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.734
Jerry:
WELL, I GUESS WE'RE IN
A TIE-BREAK SITUATION THEN.

14:27.834 --> 14:29.369
MARK?

14:29.469 --> 14:32.005
LOOK, I THINK CHERYL
REALLY SET THE BAR
AT THE TIME,

14:32.105 --> 14:35.775
BUT YOU CANNOT DENY
THAT THAT AUDITION
WAS OUTSTANDING.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.577
I'D GO WITH VIRGINIA.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.679
- SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE
ACTRESS.
- INCREDIBLE.

14:39.779 --> 14:42.282
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S EVEN READING
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.783
YEAH.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.318
YOU KNOW,
IT WAS AMAZING.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.854
Jerry:
LOOK, BELIEVE ME,
YOU PROBABLY

14:47.955 --> 14:50.223
ARE GONNA
BE BETTER OFF

14:50.323 --> 14:53.826
BECAUSE WORKING WITH
SOMEONE WHO YOU WERE
INVOLVED WITH,

14:53.927 --> 14:55.628
YOU KNOW,
THERE COULD BE
SOME TENSION THERE.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.764
YOU'LL BE GLAD THAT--

14:57.864 --> 15:00.968
THAT THERE'S NO CHANCE
OF ANYTHING HAPPENING
WITH YOU AND CHERYL.

15:01.068 --> 15:03.036
YOU'LL SEE.
DON'T WORRY,
CHERYL WILL BE FINE.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.973
YOU'RE GONNA BE
VERY HAPPY.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.108
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GO
WITH VIRGINIA.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.443
GOOD, ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL GO WITH...

15:13.613 --> 15:15.548
( alarm beeping )

15:18.585 --> 15:20.954
Clerk:
HAVE A NICE DAY.

15:21.054 --> 15:22.255
- HI.
- HEY.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.590
- WELCOME BACK.
- YOU REMEMBER ME?

15:23.690 --> 15:25.358
I REMEMBER YOU
FROM THE FIRE.

15:25.458 --> 15:29.329
- MY PANTS WERE LEFT
IN THE DRESSING ROOM.
- THEY WERE?

15:29.429 --> 15:31.364
'CAUSE I COULDN'T HANG AROUND
TILL THE STORE OPENED.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.333
AND I NEED TO PAY
FOR THE ONES
I'M WEARING.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.235
UM...

15:35.335 --> 15:38.638
I DON'T SEE--
THEY'RE NOT--
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.473
THEY'RE NOT HERE,
SO...

15:40.573 --> 15:42.475
WHAT ARE YOU--
HOW COULD THEY
NOT BE THERE?

15:42.575 --> 15:45.612
EVERY NIGHT THEY
COMPLETELY CLEAN OUT
THE DRESSING ROOM,

15:45.712 --> 15:47.614
AND ANYTHING
THAT'S IN THERE
THEY PUT IT IN HERE

15:47.714 --> 15:50.383
IN THE LOST AND FOUND
AND IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT HERE.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.920
- SO YOU'VE LOST MY PANTS?
- I'M-- I'M SORRY,
THEY'RE GONE.

15:54.021 --> 15:58.191
SO HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO PAY FOR THOSE?

16:00.060 --> 16:03.163
WELL, HOW COULD
I PAY FOR THE PANTS

16:03.263 --> 16:06.066
IF YOU LOST MY PANTS?
THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.767
FIRST OF ALL,
WE DIDN'T LOSE THEM.
THEY'RE GONE.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.836
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN LOST AND GONE?
- YES.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.239
- LOST IS DIFFERENT
THAN GONE.
- THEY'RE LOST AND GONE.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.974
IF THEY'RE LOST,
THEY'D BE HERE IN
THE LOST AND FOUND.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.443
THEY'RE GONE AND THAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.611
NO, IF THEY WERE LOST,
THEY WOULDN'T BE THERE.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.347
THEY'D BE LOST,
WHICH THEY ARE.

16:20.447 --> 16:23.250
OKAY, WE HAVE A SIGN
IN THE FITTING ROOM
THAT SAYS THAT

16:23.350 --> 16:25.185
WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR ANY LOST ITEMS.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.321
GOOD FOR YOU.
I GOT A SIGN AT
MY HOUSE, OKAY?

16:28.421 --> 16:31.024
IT SAYS "IF SOMEBODY
TAKES YOUR PANTS,
YOU TAKE THEIRS."

16:31.124 --> 16:33.393
- THAT'S MY SIGN.
- THAT'S A STUPID
MADE-UP SIGN.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.862
THAT DOESN'T EXIST.
NOBODY HAS A SIGN
LIKE THAT.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.430
OF COURSE I DON'T
HAVE A SIGN LIKE THAT.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.566
I JUST MADE IT UP
FOR THE PURPOSES OF
THIS DISCUSSION.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.302
- IT'S OBVIOUS I MADE IT UP.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU BELIEVE.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.371
YOU MIGHT BELIEVE
THESE THINGS YOU SAY.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.139
SO YOU MIGHT BELIEVE
THAT I PUT UP A SIGN
IN MY BEDROOM THAT SAYS

16:46.239 --> 16:47.840
"IF YOU TAKE MY PANTS,
I TAKE YOURS"?

16:47.940 --> 16:49.909
SO IT'S NOT
THAT UNFATHOMABLE.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.278
OKAY, YOU HAVE
TO REPLACE MY PANTS.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.313
I'M NOT GONNA PAY
FOR THESE PANTS.

16:53.413 --> 16:55.915
NO, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
GONNA WALK AROUND WITH
A SECURITY TAG ON THAT

16:56.015 --> 16:57.750
AND SOMEONE'S GONNA
ARREST YOU OR SOMETHING.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.219
IT'S LIKE
A SCARLET LETTER.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.987
I'M HAPPY TO WEAR
THE SCARLET LETTER.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.123
- CALL ME HESTER.
- I WON'T CALL YOU HESTER.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.358
- CALL ME HESTER.
- I WON'T CALL YOU HESTER.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.394
YOU'RE NOT--
SIR, YOU CANNOT LEAVE
WITH THOSE PANTS.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.129
- REALLY?
- ( alarm beeping )

17:09.229 --> 17:12.232
IT'S GONNA
FOLLOW YOU AROUND,
THAT SOUND.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.536
- LARRY.
- HI.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.739
- DID YOU JUST SET OFF
THE ALARM IN THERE?
- YEAH, I-I DID.

17:19.839 --> 17:22.975
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
GET YOUR OTHER PANTS.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.844
THEY-- THEY DON'T
HAVE MY OTHER PANTS.

17:24.944 --> 17:28.148
THEY LOST THEM,
SO I TOOK THESE.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.783
WHAT DID EVERYBODY SAY
ABOUT THE AUDITION?

17:30.883 --> 17:34.487
- UM...
- OH, NO.

17:34.587 --> 17:37.290
- I WASN'T GOOD.
- NO, YOU WERE GREAT.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.726
- YOU WEREN'T GOOD,
YOU WERE GREAT.
- OH, GOD.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.494
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

17:41.594 --> 17:44.397
JERRY WANTS TO
GIVE IT TO VIRGINIA.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.401
I'M SO SORRY.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.438
- I THOUGHT THIS
WAS A FORMALITY.
- I THOUGHT SO TOO.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.905
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A DONE DEAL.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.474
- I THOUGHT SO TOO.
- OH, GOSH.

17:54.574 --> 17:58.311
- AND I'M SORRY.
I APOLOGIZE.
- VIRGINIA GOT IT?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.447
I MEAN, SHE'LL BE--
SHE'LL BE GREAT.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.615
- I'M SURE SHE'S THRILLED.
- SHE'LL BE OKAY.
SHE'S NOT YOU.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.884
I KNOW, BUT I'M GLAD
THAT SHE GOT IT IF
I DIDN'T GET IT.

18:04.984 --> 18:06.386
- THAT'S GOOD.
- UGH.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.054
WE ACTUALLY
ALL GOT TOGETHER,

18:08.155 --> 18:11.991
DENNIS AND VIRGINIA
AND ME, AND HAD LUNCH.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.426
GOT A LITTLE CRAZY,
ACTUALLY.

18:13.526 --> 18:17.230
DENNIS, AFTER A FEW
GLASSES OF WINE...

18:17.330 --> 18:20.400
OH, YOU KNOW, VIRGINIA
WENT TO THE BATHROOM

18:20.500 --> 18:24.070
AND HE ASKED ME
IF I WAS INTERESTED
IN A MENAGE A TROIS.

18:24.171 --> 18:27.607
I MEAN, I WAS--

18:27.707 --> 18:29.342
I MEAN, I WAS
A LITTLE FLATTERED.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.011
- I JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D FIND IT FUNNY.
- FUNNY?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.347
- THAT'S FUNNY.
- THAT'S FUNNY?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.649
I DON'T FIND
THAT FUNNY AT ALL.
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?

18:36.749 --> 18:39.319
- FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE MY EX-WIFE, OKAY?
- OKAY.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.020
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A MENAGE A TROIS
WITH ANYBODY,

18:41.120 --> 18:42.489
IT'S GONNA BE WITH ME,
NOT WITH HIM.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.492
WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE
IN A MENAGE A TROIS
WITH YOU?

18:45.592 --> 18:48.361
WELL, YOU WOULDN'T.
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING
TO DO IT,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.430
I'D PREFER
THAT IT WOULD BE
WITH ME, THAT'S ALL.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.665
OKAY.

18:52.765 --> 18:56.803
- HE WAS SERIOUS?
- YEAH, HE WAS SERIOUS.

18:56.903 --> 19:00.273
YEAH YEAH.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.054
YES, IT'S MORE MONEY.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.823
IT'S A LOT MORE MONEY,
BUT I CAN DO IT FOR YOU.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.358
HANG ON. YEAH.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.360
LOOK, I'LL MEET YOU
IN 20 MINUTES, ALL RIGHT?

19:20.460 --> 19:22.995
RIGHT THERE AT THE SITE.
HI, LARRY, WHAT'S UP?

19:23.095 --> 19:24.964
YOU ASKED MY WIFE
TO BE IN A THREESOME?

19:25.064 --> 19:27.367
- WIFE?
- YES.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.369
- YOU MEAN EX-WIFE.
- WHATEVER.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.438
- THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
- NO, THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.040
YOU DON'T NEED
TO CONCERN YOURSELF
WITH THE DIFFERENCE, OKAY?

19:34.140 --> 19:36.276
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

19:38.411 --> 19:42.081
YES, I ASKED
YOUR EX-WIFE

19:42.181 --> 19:45.352
IF SHE WOULD LIKE
TO BE IN A THREESOME
WITH MY CURRENT WIFE.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.153
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- WHAT'S IT TO YOU, LARRY?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.855
- WHAT'S IT TO ME?
- YEAH.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.423
BECAUSE I-I HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HER

19:50.523 --> 19:52.091
AND I DON'T NEED YOU
TO DEFILE HER, OKAY?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.693
I WOULD NOT
BE DEFILING HER.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.395
WHATEVER TWO PEOPLE DO,
OR THREE PEOPLE DO,

19:55.495 --> 19:56.929
IN THE PRIVACY
OF THEIR OWN HOMES
IS THEIR OWN BUSINESS.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.531
YEAH, I'VE HEARD
THAT BULLSHIT.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.300
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED
IN DOING ANYTHING

20:00.400 --> 20:02.469
IN THE PRIVACY
OF YOUR HOME, OKAY?

20:02.569 --> 20:04.871
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH, REALLY.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.172
THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.140
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:08.241 --> 20:11.911
LARRY, JUST BECAUSE
CHERYL IS CURIOUS

20:12.011 --> 20:14.180
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU HAVE ANY RIGHT
TO GET MAD AT ME, OKAY?

20:14.281 --> 20:16.082
- CHILL OUT.
- CURIOUS?

20:16.182 --> 20:18.017
- DID YOU SAY CURIOUS?
- CURIOUS.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.320
Larry:
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:28.895 --> 20:31.230
- HEY.
- HEY.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.869
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- NOTHING.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.105
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NOTHING?
WHAT'S ALL THIS FIDGET?

20:39.205 --> 20:40.607
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

20:40.707 --> 20:42.909
I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOUR UNDERWEAR.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.210
UNCOMFORTABLE
OR SOMETHING?

20:44.311 --> 20:47.079
I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH MY UNDERWEAR.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.748
ALL OF A SUDDEN
OUT OF NOWHERE?

20:48.848 --> 20:51.484
- WHAT, DO YOU HAVE
A NEW BRAND OR SOMETHING?
- YEAH, I DO.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.185
REALLY?
WHERE'D YOU BUY THEM?

20:53.286 --> 20:54.987
- ONLINE.
- ONLINE?

20:55.087 --> 20:57.223
THAT'S A LOAD OF SHIT.
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO
USE A COMPUTER.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.759
THE LAST MAN ON EARTH,
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO USE A COMPUTER.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.161
- HOW DO YOU BUY IT ONLINE?
- MY ASSISTANT BUYS IT FOR ME.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.196
OH, REALLY?
FROM WHAT WEBSITE?

21:04.297 --> 21:06.966
- WHAT SITE DOES
SHE BUY IT FROM?
- HI HI HI.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.436
- LARRY AND I GOTTA
TALK ABOUT SOME STUFF.
- YEAH, I BET YOU DO.

21:09.536 --> 21:12.705
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO
TALK ABOUT SOME STUFF.

21:14.541 --> 21:17.610
CLEARLY SHE IS NOT
BELIEVING A WORD OF THIS.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.747
- I THOUGHT SHE WAS
BUYING IT AT FIRST.
- SHE'S NOT BUYING IT.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.749
I WATCHED
THE WHOLE THING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:22.849 --> 21:25.418
- IT'S CRAZY.
- I'M DOING THE BEST
I CAN, YOU KNOW.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.654
I'M-- I'M TRYING TO PLAY
LIKE SLIGHT TRANSVESTITE.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.656
- SLIGHT TRANSVESTITE?
- YES.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.725
IT'S A COMFORT THING.
DON'T ADD A TRANSVESTITE
LEVEL TO THIS.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.562
A GUY WHO WEARS
WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR
IS-- IS PART TRANNY.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.229
- HE'S NOT PART TRANNY.
- HE'S PART TRANNY.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.532
NO, YOU'RE CRAZY.
HE WANTS COMFORT.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.200
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE,
THAT'S IT.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.969
YOU'RE LARRY DAVID
AND YOU LIKE COMFORT

21:43.069 --> 21:44.671
IN WOMEN'S PANTIES,
ALL RIGHT?

21:44.771 --> 21:47.006
- SIMPLE.
- NO, IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE.
IT'S NOT SO SIMPLE.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.041
- SHH SHH!
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO PLAY THAT.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.544
- I LIKE THE COMFORT
OF WOMAN'S PANTIES.
- THAT'S IT, THAT'S ALL.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.480
- HOW DO YOU PLAY--
- ASK ME A QUESTION.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.549
- WHERE DO YOU GET
YOUR UNDERWEAR?
- MANY DIFFERENT PLACES.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.486
STOP OVERACTING,
JUST KEEP IT ON
THE DOWN, OKAY?

21:59.586 --> 22:01.721
COME ON.
ALL RIGHT?

22:01.821 --> 22:03.856
YOU'RE LARRY DAVID.
WHO ARE YOU?

22:03.956 --> 22:06.158
- I'M LARRY DAVID.
- AND WHAT DO YOU
HAPPEN TO ENJOY?

22:06.258 --> 22:08.995
- I HAPPEN TO ENJOY
WEARING WOMEN'S PANTIES.
- PERFECT, THAT'S IT.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.263
- I'M VERY
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.
- VERY COMFORTABLE.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.965
LISTEN, I GOT
BIG FUCKING NEWS.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.567
HUGE.
YOU READY FOR THIS?

22:14.667 --> 22:18.170
I GOT A CALL FROM VIRGINIA.
SHE CAN'T DO THE PART.

22:18.270 --> 22:20.973
SHE'S IN A NECK BRACE.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.709
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
- NO.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.545
- OH MY GOD.
- YES, AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.614
- CHERYL'S GONNA DO THE PART.
- CHERYL'S GONNA DO THE PART.

22:27.714 --> 22:30.550
- THIS IS FANTASTIC.
- YES, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.785
WHAT-- WHAT HAPPENED?

22:32.885 --> 22:34.787
SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.
I SAID, "WHAT HAPPENED?"

22:34.887 --> 22:36.823
AND SHE SAID,
"IT'S NOT IMPORTANT."

22:36.923 --> 22:40.059
- HMM.
- YEAH.

22:40.159 --> 22:43.062
- INTERESTING.
- WHAT?

22:43.162 --> 22:46.265
- AS FAR AS I KNOW...
- YEAH?

22:46.365 --> 22:50.002
- ...THERE'S ONLY TWO WAYS
YOU CAN INJURE YOUR NECK.
- MM-HMM.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.805
- ONE IS A CAR ACCIDENT.
- YEAH.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.141
- THE OTHER'S CUNNILINGUS.
- MM-HMM.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.843
IF IT WASN'T
A CAR ACCIDENT,

22:56.943 --> 23:00.146
SHE INJURED HER NECK
GOING DOWN ON CHERYL.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.114
- CHERYL?
OH MY GOD.
- YES!

23:02.214 --> 23:04.150
- THEY HAD A MENAGE A TROIS.
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.420
IT COULD'VE BEEN
A CAR ACCIDENT.
YOU DON'T KNOW.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.055
LET'S CHECK HER CAR.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.957
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S CHECK HER CAR.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.192
- ALL RIGHT, WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M LARRY DAVID.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.961
AND WHAT DO YOU
HAPPEN TO ENJOY?

23:15.061 --> 23:17.497
- I HAPPEN TO ENJOY
WEARING WOMEN'S PANTIES.
- LET'S GO.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.238
- ( toys clatter )
- HEY.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.674
WHAT ARE YOU,
AN IDIOT?

23:27.774 --> 23:30.643
- I DIDN'T-- SORRY.
- OUCH.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.284
- IT'S CLEAN.
- CLEAN.

23:38.384 --> 23:39.819
SEE ANYTHING?

23:39.919 --> 23:42.088
I DON'T SEE
ANY DAMAGE AT ALL.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.195
NOTHING.

23:49.295 --> 23:52.732
- CHERYL.
- CUNNILINGUS.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.201
- ( dog barking )
- LOOK OUT.

24:06.513 --> 24:09.549
SO...

24:09.649 --> 24:11.984
I HAVE SOME NEWS.

24:12.084 --> 24:16.388
VIRGINIA CAN'T
DO THE PART.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.857
YOU'RE PLAYING
GEORGE'S EX-WIFE.

24:17.957 --> 24:21.160
I'M GONNA PLAY
GEORGE'S EX-WIFE?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.829
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

24:22.929 --> 24:25.431
- CONGRATULATIONS.

ON BOARD WITH THIS?

24:25.532 --> 24:28.134

JERRY SAID YES...

24:28.234 --> 24:30.102
- ...AND YOU TALKED IT
OVER AND--
- YEAH.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.739
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
DIDN'T CALL ME AS SOON
AS YOU HEARD THE NEWS.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.675
- I WANTED TO,
YOU KNOW, SAVE IT.
- THIS IS SO FANTASTIC.

24:35.775 --> 24:39.278
- HUH?
- SO I CAN TELL
MY MOM AND EVERYBODY?

24:39.378 --> 24:41.047
TELL ALL YOUR FAMILY.
TELL THEM ALL, YEAH.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.616
- AND MENTION ME
WHEN YOU TELL THEM.
- I WILL MENTION YOU.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.284
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.
THANK YOU.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.820
- I KINDA PUT
THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER.
- THANK YOU, LARRY.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.590
WOW, SO WHAT HAPPENED
WITH VIRGINIA?

24:50.690 --> 24:53.325
WHY CAN'T SHE DO IT?

24:53.425 --> 24:56.663
WHAT AN INTERESTING
QUESTION.

24:57.730 --> 24:59.331
WHY CAN'T SHE DO IT?

24:59.431 --> 25:01.534
WELL...

25:01.634 --> 25:05.437
IT SEEMS AS IF VIRGINIA
HURT HER NECK.

25:05.538 --> 25:06.906
- MMM.
- OOH.

25:07.006 --> 25:09.976
- HOW DID SHE
HURT HER NECK?
- ( laughs )

25:11.377 --> 25:12.945
VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.815
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU'RE GOOD.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.483
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.285
YOU'RE GONNA DO
VERY WELL IN THIS PART.

25:19.385 --> 25:22.488
- HOW DID SHE HURT HER NECK?
- HOW DID SHE HURT HER NECK?

25:22.589 --> 25:25.124
- WE ALL KNOW...
- MM-HMM.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.561
...THERE'S ONLY
TWO WAYS A PERSON
CAN INJURE THEIR NECK.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.329
ONE IS A CAR ACCIDENT.

25:30.429 --> 25:31.898
AND SHE WAS NOT
IN A CAR ACCIDENT

25:31.998 --> 25:33.700
BECAUSE I CHECKED
THE CAR.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.604
- OKAY.
- THE OTHER
IS CUNNILINGUS.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.740
AND I SUBMIT

25:40.840 --> 25:43.843
SHE PERFORMED IT
ON YOU IN A THREESOME.

25:45.244 --> 25:48.447
- COME ON.
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:48.547 --> 25:49.882
LISTEN, WE'RE ADULTS.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.584
- LET'S JUST
GET PAST THIS.
- OH MY GOD.

25:51.684 --> 25:54.053
BECAUSE I TOLD YOU ABOUT
DENNIS AND THE THREE-WAY.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.922
- PLEASE, STOP.
- THERE ARE TWO WAYS
TO INJURE--

25:56.022 --> 25:58.024
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO HURT YOUR NECK, LARRY,

25:58.124 --> 25:59.726
BESIDES HAVING
TO GO DOWN ON SOMEONE.

25:59.826 --> 26:01.427
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- NAME ONE.

26:01.527 --> 26:03.095
- YOU COULD-- PAINTING.
- PAINTING?

26:03.195 --> 26:06.633
- UGH.
- YOU KNOW, I NEVER SAW
MICHELANGELO IN A BRACE.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.035
( cell phone ringing )

26:10.502 --> 26:13.205
- HELLO?
- SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE ME.
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE ME.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.007
SHE'S GONNA LEAVE ME.
SHE'S GONNA LEAVE ME, MAN.

26:15.107 --> 26:17.076
- I'm fucked!
- ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.878
She still thinks
the panties are mine.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.648
Susie:
JEFFREY, WHERE ARE YOU?

26:21.748 --> 26:23.816
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.384
THINK OF SOMETHING,
ALL RIGHT?

26:25.484 --> 26:27.053
Come on, man,
I need your help!

26:27.153 --> 26:29.588
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE AN IDEA.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.023
- Really?
- I DO.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.059
- Come over right now.
- IT COULD WORK.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.628
MAN, FUCKIN' PANTIES.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.664
- I'M A FUCKIN' IDIOT.
- Okay, I'm coming over.

26:37.764 --> 26:42.134
* GEE, OFFICER KRUPKE,
WE'RE VERY UPSET *

26:42.234 --> 26:44.837
* WE NEVER HAD THE LOVE

26:44.937 --> 26:48.875
* OH, OFFICER KRUPKE,

26:48.975 --> 26:52.979
* GEE, OFFICER KRUPKE,

26:53.079 --> 26:55.081
- THAT'S--
THAT'S THE SAME GUY.
- IT IS?

26:55.181 --> 26:57.483
- Boy: HE USED
A BAD WORD, MOM.
- OH MY GOD.

26:57.583 --> 27:00.186
WHAT A JERK.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.857
IT'S A GOOD PLAN,
BUT IT'S JUST GOTTA
BE NATURAL.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.826
YOU CAN'T JUST-- YOU KNOW,
IT'S GOTTA BE NATURAL.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.661
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.
- OKAY.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.863
- JEFF?
- YEAH?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.899
VIRGINIA GOT
IN A REALLY BAD
CAR ACCIDENT.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.101
- WHAT?
- HER NECK IS ALL FUCKED UP.
SHE'S IN A BRACE.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.103
SHE DIDN'T GET
IN CAR ACCIDENT, OKAY?

27:17.203 --> 27:18.971
I SAW HER CAR.
THERE'S NOT A SCRATCH ON IT.

27:19.071 --> 27:21.040
NO, SHE DID,
LARRY, OKAY?

27:21.140 --> 27:23.676
SHE WAS
DRIVING DENNIS'S CAR,
ASSHOLE KNOW-IT-ALL.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.344
- Jeff: HIS CAR'S--
- ( knocking at door )

27:25.444 --> 27:28.180
Susie:
HIS CAR IS ALL FUCKED UP.
WHO'S THAT?

27:28.280 --> 27:30.783
Officer Krupke:

27:30.883 --> 27:33.052

27:33.152 --> 27:35.888

27:40.459 --> 27:42.829
WE RECEIVED
A CALL ABOUT YOU
USING OBSCENITIES

27:42.929 --> 27:44.697
AGAINST A WOMAN
AND HER CHILDREN.

27:44.797 --> 27:46.265
WHAT?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

27:46.365 --> 27:49.068
I SANG THE SONG I SANG TO YOU.
"OFFICER KRUPKE, KRUP YOU."

27:49.168 --> 27:51.370
I DIDN'T SAY FUCK YOU.
I SAID KRUP YOU.

27:51.470 --> 27:55.007
- THAT'S NOT THE WAY
THEY HEARD IT.
- I WAS SINGING A SONG.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.409
KRUP YOU!

27:57.509 --> 27:59.545
WHERE'D YOU GET
THOSE PANTS?

27:59.645 --> 28:01.047
BANANA REPUBLIC.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.215
THERE'S A SECURITY TAG
ON THOSE PANTS.

28:03.315 --> 28:06.218
I TRADED THEM BECAUSE
THEY TOOK MY PANTS,
SO I TOOK THESE.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.654
- GIVE ME THE PANTS.

28:08.755 --> 28:10.689
- THESE ARE MY PANTS.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.427
- OKAY, FINE.
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS HERE.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.696
I DON'T CARE.
OKAY, HERE.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.599
Susie:

WEARING WOMEN'S PANTIES.

28:32.644 --> 28:35.014
