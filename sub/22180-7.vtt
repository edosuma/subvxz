WEBVTT

00:04.659 --> 00:06.194
JAY: Oh, hey, ma'am.

00:06.195 --> 00:07.462
- Yes?
- I'm glad I caught you.

00:07.463 --> 00:08.630
I just got the report
on coastal flooding

00:08.631 --> 00:09.697
in Southeast Asia
for tomorrow's meeting.

00:09.698 --> 00:11.332
Yeah, okay, put it on the pile...

00:11.333 --> 00:13.501
- Why aren't you leaving?
- Just got a couple more e-mails.

00:13.502 --> 00:16.236
Nope, not the deal. You
said out the door by 6:00

00:16.238 --> 00:17.472
on the nights you have Chloe.

00:17.473 --> 00:19.007
Is it 6:00 already?
- Yeah. Come on, come on, come on.

00:19.008 --> 00:20.241
Get your stuff and we'll
duck out together.

00:20.242 --> 00:21.276
Just give me a second.

00:21.277 --> 00:22.744
You have an event I don't know about?

00:22.745 --> 00:23.912
No. Yes.

00:23.913 --> 00:25.747
Well, not really an event.

00:25.748 --> 00:29.517
Just... well, Jason is...

00:29.518 --> 00:32.220
he's cooking dinner
with the new girlfriend.

00:32.220 --> 00:34.055
Girlfriend? That's new.

00:34.056 --> 00:36.024
Yeah, that is new.

00:36.025 --> 00:38.359
So is Jason. He's like a new person.

00:38.360 --> 00:41.396
He's sweet and considerate.

00:41.397 --> 00:43.998
Ha, he even remembered that
his sister's a vegetarian.

00:43.999 --> 00:45.934
- What is that?
- That's a good thing, isn't it?

00:45.935 --> 00:49.837
Yeah, I mean, it is.
It is a good thing.

00:49.838 --> 00:52.540
I'm just worried that
it won't last longer

00:52.541 --> 00:55.076
- than the relationship.
- Ma'am...

00:55.077 --> 00:56.477
- Almost made it.
- Sorry.

00:56.478 --> 00:59.547
- I can call my nanny.
- No, no. You go.

00:59.548 --> 01:00.814
Put her on the pile?

01:02.022 --> 01:04.185
Please tell me I'm not
gonna miss my dinner.

01:04.186 --> 01:05.620
Uh, you're needed at the White House.

01:05.621 --> 01:08.623
We can at least head out together.

01:08.624 --> 01:11.324
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

01:12.126 --> 01:13.962
RUSSELL: <i>We've got a bit
of a situation.</i>

01:13.963 --> 01:18.132
Our Special Envoy for
Eurasian Energy is on a plane

01:18.133 --> 01:19.701
about to take off from Moscow,

01:19.702 --> 01:24.772
and they just found a Russian
dissident hiding on board.

01:24.773 --> 01:27.475
Artem Markevich. You know him?

01:27.476 --> 01:30.612
Well, he's really more
of an Eco-activist.

01:30.613 --> 01:34.582
Last week he released shocking images

01:34.583 --> 01:37.085
of oil spills in Siberia.

01:37.086 --> 01:39.020
They were all over the news.

01:39.021 --> 01:40.555
I'm guessing Russia is mad,

01:40.556 --> 01:43.057
and now he's on the run
and seeking asylum.

01:43.058 --> 01:46.494
The Kremlin issued
a Blue Notice through Interpol

01:46.495 --> 01:48.463
about ten hours ago.
They know he's on the run,

01:48.464 --> 01:49.731
but they don't know where he is.

01:49.732 --> 01:52.166
Interpol? What are they
trying to charge him with?

01:52.167 --> 01:54.869
Pictures of the spill were
near a government oil field,

01:54.870 --> 01:58.006
so trespassing, civil disobedience,

01:58.007 --> 02:00.541
and just plain being dumb enough

02:00.542 --> 02:02.777
to be an Eco-activist in Russia.

02:02.778 --> 02:05.346
Well, it's not gonna be long
before the Kremlin figures out

02:05.347 --> 02:06.381
he's on our plane.

02:06.382 --> 02:07.982
If we want to help Markevich, sir,

02:07.983 --> 02:09.150
we're gonna have to do it now.

02:09.151 --> 02:11.452
We're already locking
horns with Russia

02:11.453 --> 02:12.654
in Afghanistan.

02:12.655 --> 02:16.124
Do we really want to
stir the pot with this?

02:16.125 --> 02:18.192
To-to risk losing their cooperation

02:18.193 --> 02:20.928
on nuclear nonproliferation or Syria?

02:20.929 --> 02:22.830
I don't think they'd go
that far over one dissident.

02:22.831 --> 02:24.899
And besides, we leave this guy behind,

02:24.900 --> 02:26.634
we're signing his death warrant.

02:26.635 --> 02:29.137
So palm him off on Sweden or whoever.

02:29.138 --> 02:30.605
Russia hacked into our embassies

02:30.606 --> 02:31.973
and leaked Intel to the Taliban

02:31.974 --> 02:35.343
that got our agent abducted
and a safe house bombed.

02:35.344 --> 02:37.545
I don't think we should
hide behind anybody.

02:37.546 --> 02:39.679
And this is a way to push back.

02:41.949 --> 02:43.651
And save a good man in the bargain.

02:43.652 --> 02:46.854
Call the Special Envoy.
Tell 'em wheels up.

02:46.855 --> 02:49.790
Start the asylum process once
Markevich arrives on our shores.

02:51.459 --> 02:53.428
- (DOOR SHUTS)
- HENRY: <i>Hey, you.</i>

02:53.429 --> 02:57.298
All right, go ahead.

02:57.299 --> 02:59.901
Tell me how great Jason's dinner was.

02:59.902 --> 03:01.602
It was pretty great.

03:01.603 --> 03:04.338
- God, I knew it.
- (INDISTINCT VOICES IN KITCHEN)

03:04.339 --> 03:05.673
(WHISPERING): How's Piper?

03:05.674 --> 03:09.877
Turns out she lived in
Kenya until she was seven.

03:09.878 --> 03:11.779
Of course she did. CIA or State?

03:11.780 --> 03:14.115
Aid workers, I think.

03:14.116 --> 03:15.616
Her parents built schools.

03:15.617 --> 03:18.619
So she's possibly more
lefty and committed

03:18.620 --> 03:20.188
than our son.

03:20.189 --> 03:22.690
Impressive. How was the food?

03:22.691 --> 03:24.125
It was good.

03:24.126 --> 03:26.060
God, I'm starving.

03:26.061 --> 03:28.262
- Will you come sit with me?
- Oh, I can't, babe.

03:28.263 --> 03:30.898
I've got to finish going over
this Afghanistan report.

03:30.899 --> 03:33.134
The Gang of Eight called
me in again tomorrow.

03:33.135 --> 03:36.204
Boy, they're really giving
SAD the third degree, huh?

03:36.205 --> 03:37.472
Well, we're asking for more money.

03:37.473 --> 03:38.940
We still have no solid Intel

03:38.941 --> 03:41.542
- that Russia's aiding the Taliban.
- (LAUGHTER IN KITCHEN)

03:41.543 --> 03:44.545
For what it's worth,
we're about to grant asylum

03:44.546 --> 03:46.748
to a Russian dissident...
at least we're pushing back.

03:46.749 --> 03:50.318
Or helping justify their aggression.

03:50.319 --> 03:52.253
Okay, now you sound
like Russell Jackson.

03:52.254 --> 03:56.290
- I'm gonna go get chicken. Good-bye.
- I sound like Russell Jackson?

03:56.291 --> 03:58.159
- It doesn't taste like...
- ELIZABETH: All right...

03:58.160 --> 04:00.294
where's this dinner
I've heard so much about?

04:00.295 --> 04:03.798
Hi, Mrs. McCord. Sorry, Secretary.

04:03.799 --> 04:05.399
Uh, I even rehearsed that.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.969
"Mrs." is fine at home.

04:07.970 --> 04:09.370
Elizabeth is even better.

04:09.371 --> 04:11.873
It's nice to finally meet you, Piper.

04:11.874 --> 04:13.374
It's so great to meet you.

04:13.375 --> 04:15.376
Uh, where should I put
your roasting pan?

04:15.377 --> 04:17.445
Oh, no, no, stop. Just leave it.

04:17.446 --> 04:18.946
Not you, keep going,

04:18.947 --> 04:20.148
because I can't believe

04:20.149 --> 04:22.483
- what I'm seeing.
- I always help out.

04:22.484 --> 04:23.718
We made you a plate.

04:23.719 --> 04:26.654
I hope you're good
with chestnut puree.

04:26.655 --> 04:28.189
You made chestnut puree?!

04:28.190 --> 04:31.592
I had a pretty amazing sous chef.

04:31.593 --> 04:34.428
Who only slightly
micromanaged the menu.

04:34.429 --> 04:37.165
- You wanted to make pancakes.
- Savory buckwheat crepes.

04:37.166 --> 04:38.366
With blueberries?

04:38.367 --> 04:41.235
I like it a little sweet.
It was a team effort.

04:41.236 --> 04:44.438
- You know?
- Well, it smells delicious.

04:44.439 --> 04:46.140
All right, come on. Come sit with me.

04:46.141 --> 04:49.844
I want to hear all about...
growing up in Kenya.

04:49.845 --> 04:53.114
Well, actually, I was kind of,
I was kind of hoping

04:53.115 --> 04:54.882
just Piper and I could hang
out until her mom comes.

04:54.883 --> 04:55.817
I don't mind hanging out

04:55.818 --> 04:57.718
- with your mom.
- Well, I mean,

04:57.719 --> 05:00.655
just... she can fill you in
on her childhood anytime.

05:00.656 --> 05:01.856
Okay...

05:01.857 --> 05:03.891
Oh, look, look, look,
look, it's Stevie, look.

05:03.892 --> 05:05.726
Yes, okay, I get it.

05:05.727 --> 05:09.663
Piper, it was really nice to meet you.

05:12.733 --> 05:14.268
Jace, door open.

05:14.269 --> 05:17.071
- JASON: Mom...
- (LAUGHS)

05:17.072 --> 05:19.173
Will you sit with me?

05:19.174 --> 05:22.210
- Yeah.
- What are we watching?

05:22.211 --> 05:24.579
Oh, um, <i>Word of the Nation</i>
is doing an interview

05:24.580 --> 05:26.147
with this woman, Kat Sandoval?

05:26.148 --> 05:28.482
She, like, used to be some kind
of political hot shot, I guess.

05:28.483 --> 05:30.818
Chief of Staff to the
Ambassador at the U.N.,

05:30.819 --> 05:32.520
I think... it was years ago.

05:32.521 --> 05:34.856
Anyway, she's got
this book coming out,

05:34.857 --> 05:37.525
and Russell Jackson would not
shut up about her today.

05:37.526 --> 05:38.526
So I have to watch this.

05:38.527 --> 05:39.760
Oh, yeah? What's Russell saying?

05:39.761 --> 05:43.331
That she's crazy and that
she's trying to cash in

05:43.332 --> 05:44.599
after she went off the rails.

05:44.600 --> 05:47.401
I mean, what did she do?

05:47.402 --> 05:48.936
Threw a chair at someone.

05:48.937 --> 05:50.571
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

05:50.572 --> 05:51.873
Never got the whole story.

05:51.874 --> 05:52.974
Wow. Oh, here we go.

05:52.975 --> 05:55.376
It is not a town that
appreciates a shake-up.

05:55.377 --> 05:57.845
Y-You saw what happened when
President Dalton ran

05:57.846 --> 05:58.946
as an independent.

05:58.947 --> 06:00.181
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

06:00.182 --> 06:01.249
Whoever thought of that idea

06:01.250 --> 06:02.917
had some serious <i>huevos.</i>

06:02.918 --> 06:05.720
It was a bold move, and I admire it.

06:05.721 --> 06:08.456
Maybe you wish you'd hung around
a little longer?

06:08.457 --> 06:11.559
Eh. I loved my life in D.C.,

06:11.560 --> 06:13.594
but by the end, this town
had sucked my soul out

06:13.595 --> 06:14.829
through my eyehole.

06:14.830 --> 06:17.899
I'm not looking
in the rearview mirror.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.367
My only concern is what's ahead.

06:19.368 --> 06:21.168
And that's avocados?

06:21.169 --> 06:22.670
- Ten acres of 'em.
- HOST: Hmm.

06:22.671 --> 06:24.238
I used to work donors and lobbyists,

06:24.239 --> 06:25.806
and now I work the land, right,

06:25.807 --> 06:27.208
bringing life out of the dirt.

06:27.209 --> 06:28.542
HOST: You talk a lot in your book...

06:28.543 --> 06:31.679
Well, I think I've found my exit plan.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.682
Yeah, you should totally
write a memoir.

06:34.683 --> 06:37.685
No. Retiring on a farm.

06:37.686 --> 06:41.055
Raising animals, growing our own food.

06:41.056 --> 06:42.623
A sustainable human society
is very much like...

06:42.624 --> 06:44.458
Mom, you do realize

06:44.459 --> 06:46.127
that we already lived
on a farm, right?

06:46.128 --> 06:48.863
Not a horse farm, a cool farm.

06:48.864 --> 06:51.299
How is her farm cooler than ours?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.668
Don't mess with my dream.

06:53.669 --> 06:54.835
- Shh.
- Mm...

06:54.836 --> 06:56.971
HENRY: <i>We've confirmed
that the location</i>

06:56.972 --> 06:59.473
of the embassy was obtained by Russia _

06:59.474 --> 07:01.208
when they hacked the Afghan embassy,

07:01.209 --> 07:02.677
which led directly to the bombing

07:02.678 --> 07:04.078
two weeks ago.

07:04.079 --> 07:07.081
What about the kidnapping
of our Agent Samadi,

07:07.082 --> 07:11.719
and the execution of her asset,
Osip Bakunin?

07:11.720 --> 07:15.222
Do we know who
orchestrated these attacks?

07:15.223 --> 07:17.959
That Intel did not come
from the embassy hacking.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.294
We're still tracking down that source.

07:20.295 --> 07:21.896
In other words, you're working with

07:21.897 --> 07:24.740
a rusty bucket with a
hole in the bottom.

07:24.741 --> 07:26.834
Senator, listen, once we rebuild
our presence in Afghanistan,

07:26.835 --> 07:28.336
we'll be able to locate...

07:28.337 --> 07:30.604
Hey, that's a bit backwards, isn't it?

07:30.605 --> 07:31.672
I mean, you come here,

07:31.673 --> 07:33.207
you're looking for
funding and resources,

07:33.208 --> 07:34.208
but how do we know that's not gonna

07:34.209 --> 07:36.042
further empower our enemies?

07:37.478 --> 07:38.479
Maybe we should just
cut out the middleman

07:38.480 --> 07:40.681
and give the Taliban a debit card.

07:40.682 --> 07:43.284
- (LAUGHTER)
- Mr. Chairman...

07:43.285 --> 07:45.219
LEE: Look, Henry, we get it.
Having eyes and ears

07:45.220 --> 07:48.322
on the ground is how we
find the hole in the bucket.

07:48.323 --> 07:50.024
But we've read the report,

07:50.025 --> 07:51.625
we've seen the work you're doing,

07:51.626 --> 07:53.694
and it is my inclination

07:53.695 --> 07:58.299
that I put my faith in the team
that you've assembled

07:58.300 --> 08:00.501
and the resources you've got.

08:00.502 --> 08:03.204
CARPENTER:
Well, that makes sense to me.

08:03.205 --> 08:05.239
How did it go?

08:05.240 --> 08:06.907
We need to find a new asset.

08:06.908 --> 08:08.676
What was the name of that
Russian military official

08:08.677 --> 08:09.851
that you and Molly picked

08:09.852 --> 08:10.911
- before we went with...?
- Maxim Polyakov.

08:10.912 --> 08:12.680
Yeah. I need you and
Alexander to pull his file,

08:12.681 --> 08:13.814
see what he's up to.

08:13.815 --> 08:15.116
After what happened to Bakunin,

08:15.117 --> 08:17.651
it's going to be next to
impossible to turn Polyakov,

08:17.652 --> 08:19.153
or any Russian, for that matter.

08:19.154 --> 08:22.487
Consider it a challenge.

08:22.488 --> 08:25.026
One speech welcoming the Eco-warrior

08:25.027 --> 08:27.294
and ambassador for Planet Earth,
Artem Markevich,

08:27.295 --> 08:28.629
to the land of the free

08:28.630 --> 08:30.264
and home of the
environmentally progressive.

08:30.265 --> 08:31.932
Hopefully none of that's in here.

08:31.933 --> 08:36.169
I might have said
"ambassador for Planet Earth."

08:36.171 --> 08:38.438
Blake, will you see if there's
time in my schedule today

08:38.440 --> 08:40.374
- to meet with Kat Sandoval?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.777
I mean, if she wants
to meet with me and all that.

08:42.778 --> 08:44.578
And, also, will you get
me a copy of her book?

08:44.579 --> 08:47.148
- Yes.
- What's that about?

08:47.149 --> 08:49.283
Saw her on a talk show.

08:49.284 --> 08:52.219
She wrote this whole
geopolitical treatise

08:52.220 --> 08:54.488
on running an avocado farm.

08:54.489 --> 08:56.924
- Yeah...
- But isn't she that crazy consultant lady

08:56.925 --> 09:01.629
who threw a chair and had
some hysterical breakdown?

09:01.630 --> 09:04.031
You know, it's funny, isn't it?

09:04.032 --> 09:08.302
When... when a man reaches
a certain breaking point

09:08.303 --> 09:10.838
and throws something, he's passionate.

09:10.839 --> 09:13.207
But when a woman reaches
the same breaking point,

09:13.208 --> 09:16.310
she's hysterical and can't
stand the pressure.

09:16.311 --> 09:18.412
You know, you should
clear that up with her

09:18.413 --> 09:19.713
- when she comes.
- BLAKE: Ma'am?

09:19.714 --> 09:21.449
Yeah.

09:21.450 --> 09:22.817
Artem Markevich's plane
landed about 20 minutes ago.

09:22.818 --> 09:24.118
Great, I want to see him right away.

09:24.119 --> 09:25.586
No, he's on the way
to St. Lucius Hospital.

09:25.587 --> 09:27.021
He's being put in quarantine.

09:27.022 --> 09:28.856
For what?

09:28.857 --> 09:30.124
Smallpox.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.693
How do you get smallpox?
It doesn't even exist anymore.

09:32.694 --> 09:34.028
It does in laboratories.

09:34.029 --> 09:36.229
One here and one in Russia.

09:37.398 --> 09:41.500
You think Russia deliberately
infected this guy with smallpox?

09:41.501 --> 09:43.671
And sent him here.
That's crazy, even for Russia.

09:43.672 --> 09:48.409
Hell of an escalation.

09:48.410 --> 09:55.843

09:58.371 --> 10:02.098
Smallpox is a highly contagious
virus, with an estimated

10:02.099 --> 10:06.035
mortality rate of 30-35%.

10:06.036 --> 10:07.670
Millions died of the disease

10:07.671 --> 10:10.406
before it was declared eradicated by

10:10.407 --> 10:12.642
the World Health Organization in 1980.

10:12.643 --> 10:15.078
We at the CDC have one
of the remaining stockpiles

10:15.079 --> 10:16.079
of the virus.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.947
The other one is in a Russian facility

10:17.948 --> 10:19.048
in Siberia.

10:19.049 --> 10:20.583
The other passengers
on Markevich's plane,

10:20.584 --> 10:21.518
they're being treated?

10:21.519 --> 10:22.986
Yes, sir. So far,

10:22.987 --> 10:24.754
none of the flight crew
or the passengers

10:24.755 --> 10:25.822
are showing symptoms.

10:25.823 --> 10:27.524
So what about Markevich?

10:27.525 --> 10:28.992
He was already symptomatic.

10:28.993 --> 10:31.794
All we can do right now
is make him comfortable

10:31.795 --> 10:34.630
and hope that his immune
system can ride it out.

10:36.866 --> 10:39.168
Thank you, Charlotte. Keep us updated.

10:39.169 --> 10:40.802
Thank you, Mr. President.

10:44.674 --> 10:48.011
Russia didn't know Markevich
was headed to America.

10:48.012 --> 10:50.146
Uh...

10:50.147 --> 10:53.683
I don't think this is
a calculated biological attack.

10:53.684 --> 10:56.686
Calculated or not,
we're going to the U.N.

10:56.687 --> 10:59.055
I want international sanctions
against Russia.

10:59.056 --> 11:01.202
They can't play around
with infectious diseases

11:01.203 --> 11:02.335
without consequence.

11:02.336 --> 11:04.561
I think we should hold off
for a moment, sir.

11:04.562 --> 11:07.078
For Russia to do this,
they'd have to know

11:07.079 --> 11:08.613
it was a declaration of war,

11:08.614 --> 11:11.249
not just with the U.S., but the world.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.718
Time's not on our side here.

11:13.719 --> 11:15.219
Ephraim, check with the I.C.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.054
Find out if there's any
chatter about Russia

11:17.055 --> 11:18.222
weaponizing smallpox.

11:18.223 --> 11:19.290
Yes, sir.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.359
Reach out to the Russian
foreign minister.

11:21.360 --> 11:22.894
See what he has to say.

11:22.895 --> 11:25.781
And we'll hold off on
the public rebuke for now.

11:25.782 --> 11:27.179
But if there's any indication

11:27.180 --> 11:29.682
that the Russians are flirting
with a global pandemic,

11:29.683 --> 11:32.116
our response will be unequivocal.

11:33.352 --> 11:34.853
ELIZABETH:
Hey there. How was the hearing?

11:34.854 --> 11:37.589
HENRY: <i>Not great.
About what I expected.</i>

11:37.590 --> 11:39.491
Can't say the same for the
conversation I just had

11:39.492 --> 11:40.993
with Jason's guidance counselor.

11:40.994 --> 11:42.428
Why? What's going on?

11:42.429 --> 11:43.629
Well, he basically tanked

11:43.630 --> 11:44.897
his last calculus exam,

11:44.898 --> 11:47.366
and he took an incomplete
on his U.S. history project.

11:47.367 --> 11:49.535
That's weird. He likes those classes.

11:49.536 --> 11:51.904
Teachers say that he's distracted.

11:51.905 --> 11:55.074
Well, I love that he's in a love fog,

11:55.075 --> 11:58.110
but we are not raising
a high school dropout.

11:58.111 --> 11:59.445
Well, listen, I'm at the War College.

11:59.446 --> 12:01.447
I can maybe drop home between classes,

12:01.448 --> 12:03.115
catch him and have a conversation

12:03.116 --> 12:04.950
about priorities,
and lead him back to the light.

12:04.951 --> 12:06.552
Less leading, more telling.

12:06.553 --> 12:08.721
I say no more Piper on weeknights.

12:08.722 --> 12:10.089
Not until his grades go up.

12:10.090 --> 12:12.191
- Agreed.
- And I don't want to hear any rants

12:12.192 --> 12:14.026
about dictatorial parenting.

12:14.027 --> 12:15.327
Not from Jace, I mean.

12:15.328 --> 12:17.229
You can rant all you want.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.597
(CHUCKLES)

12:18.598 --> 12:21.834
ELIZABETH: <i>Mr. Avdonin. How are you?</i>

12:21.835 --> 12:24.770
At the moment, appalled,
Madam Secretary.

12:24.771 --> 12:26.705
You were obligated to notify us

12:26.706 --> 12:29.508
of the whereabouts of Artem Markevich.

12:29.509 --> 12:33.145
We demand his return immediately,

12:33.146 --> 12:35.581
or my country is
prepared to retaliate.

12:35.582 --> 12:37.182
Really?

12:37.183 --> 12:38.684
You want him back?

12:38.685 --> 12:41.320
Fine. I'll put him
on a plane right now.

12:41.321 --> 12:43.222
- Thank you.
- Hope you're ready

12:43.223 --> 12:46.024
to put him in quarantine,
like we had to.

12:46.025 --> 12:48.160
Why? What does he have?

12:48.161 --> 12:51.330
Smallpox. We've got everyone
he came in contact with

12:51.331 --> 12:53.632
under observation.

12:53.633 --> 12:55.834
(SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN)

12:55.835 --> 12:58.036
How is this possible?

12:58.037 --> 13:00.539
Well, there's only two
labs in the world

13:00.540 --> 13:03.509
that have stockpiles of the virus.

13:03.510 --> 13:05.110
Why don't you tell me?

13:05.111 --> 13:06.979
Madam Secretary.

13:06.980 --> 13:11.083
Are you implying that
my government could be capable

13:11.084 --> 13:12.950
of deliberately...

13:13.685 --> 13:16.388
It's unthinkable.

13:16.389 --> 13:18.524
I have to discuss this development.

13:18.525 --> 13:20.358
Excuse me.

13:22.661 --> 13:24.863
I don't think he had any idea.

13:24.864 --> 13:28.333
That was definitely not Russia's
usual non-denial denial.

13:28.334 --> 13:31.370
This doesn't mean that
Russia didn't infect him.

13:31.371 --> 13:34.072
It just means they didn't
read in their foreign minister.

13:34.073 --> 13:35.307
(DOOR CLOSES)

13:35.308 --> 13:36.308
Hey, Jace?

13:36.309 --> 13:37.476
JASON: Yeah.

13:37.477 --> 13:38.977
Come here a minute.

13:38.978 --> 13:40.379
Hey. Hey.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.080
Can we make this quick?
I'm trying to get to Piper's.

13:42.081 --> 13:44.616
Yeah, come here. Sit down.

13:44.617 --> 13:46.118
Listen. (CLEARS THROAT)

13:46.119 --> 13:48.687
I got a call from your
guidance counselor.

13:48.688 --> 13:50.455
Want to tell me what's going on?

13:50.456 --> 13:53.859
I'm assuming this is
about the "D" in calculus.

13:53.860 --> 13:55.727
And the incomplete in U.S. history.

13:55.728 --> 13:57.563
Wh-What's happening?

13:57.564 --> 14:00.064
I don't know. I guess I'm happy.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.901
What?

14:02.902 --> 14:04.903
(SIGHS)

14:04.904 --> 14:08.240
Hey... it-it's really exciting,
having a girlfriend. I get it.

14:08.241 --> 14:09.308
(SCOFFS) I-I do, but...

14:09.309 --> 14:10.676
Dude, it's your junior year...

14:10.677 --> 14:13.245
No. I-I'm... Stop.
I'm sorry. It's-it's...

14:13.246 --> 14:15.714
It's just how you say it.

14:15.715 --> 14:18.984
Like, like, you really,
obviously don't get it at all.

14:18.985 --> 14:21.086
Re... well, try me.

14:21.087 --> 14:24.189
I'm talking about life having purpose.

14:24.190 --> 14:25.924
Like, for the first time.

14:25.925 --> 14:29.394
Li-Like-like, I discovered
this whole other universe

14:29.395 --> 14:31.230
that I never knew existed,

14:31.231 --> 14:35.801
and it doesn't include calculus
or tests or old, dead wars.

14:35.802 --> 14:37.502
And now I live there.

14:37.503 --> 14:40.405
That's incredible. Really.

14:40.406 --> 14:41.540
I...

14:41.541 --> 14:43.308
Love is a transformative experience.

14:43.309 --> 14:45.446
But until your grades improve,

14:45.447 --> 14:46.841
you're gonna have to
live in this universe

14:46.842 --> 14:48.113
- on weekdays.
- No. No, Dad, stop.

14:48.114 --> 14:49.948
No... what do you want me to do? Huh?

14:49.949 --> 14:52.417
Study for some tests
that don't matter?

14:52.418 --> 14:53.518
Fine. I'll do it.

14:53.519 --> 14:54.853
But you can't, you can't banish me...

14:54.854 --> 14:56.321
- "Banish"?
- ...from go... ban...

14:56.322 --> 14:59.491
I can't be contained by borders
in time or space, Dad.

14:59.492 --> 15:01.159
I love her.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.427
(EXHALES)

15:02.428 --> 15:05.097
Well... and every great
love has obstacles.

15:05.098 --> 15:07.266
The hero has to have
something to overcome

15:07.267 --> 15:10.469
to prove that he's worthy.

15:10.470 --> 15:12.737
Guess what yours is.

15:13.805 --> 15:16.073
Fine.

15:20.178 --> 15:21.680
- ELIZABETH: <i>Hey.</i>
- BLAKE: <i>Hi.</i>

15:21.681 --> 15:23.482
I've got an emergency protocol
briefing at the White House.

15:23.483 --> 15:25.584
- Oh.
- Ooh. It came in.

15:25.585 --> 15:27.486
Any news yet from the DNI?

15:27.487 --> 15:29.755
Uh, I just got off the
phone with Ephraim.

15:29.756 --> 15:31.757
Nothing from the I.C. yet
about Russia and smallpox,

15:31.758 --> 15:32.824
but he's still looking.

15:32.825 --> 15:34.459
Quarantine just broke on the news.

15:34.460 --> 15:35.694
Did we release that?

15:35.695 --> 15:37.462
(SIGHS) The hospital;
this must have been a leak.

15:37.463 --> 15:38.697
Ma'am, I'm so sorry, but I wasn't able

15:38.698 --> 15:40.432
to reach Kat Sandoval
before she arrived.

15:40.433 --> 15:41.533
She's coming up?

15:41.534 --> 15:44.102
She's already here.

15:44.103 --> 15:45.404
Kat Sandoval.

15:45.405 --> 15:47.505
It's a pleasure to meet you, really.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.943
Uh, this is my chief of staff,
Jay Whitman.

15:50.944 --> 15:52.377
Hey. Great work with Ben Price

15:52.378 --> 15:54.112
- on sanctions in Iran.
- Oh, I was just teeing up

15:54.113 --> 15:55.247
your nuclear agreement.

15:55.248 --> 15:56.481
That was amazing.

15:56.482 --> 15:57.883
It all starts at the top, but thanks.

15:57.884 --> 15:59.952
This is my assistant, Blake Moran.

15:59.953 --> 16:01.186
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

16:01.187 --> 16:02.721
Now I have to reschedule you.

16:02.722 --> 16:06.491
Yes, I'm so sorry, but there's
an emergency White House thing.

16:06.492 --> 16:08.527
It must be smallpox. That's a doozy.

16:08.528 --> 16:10.128
Yeah. It is.

16:10.129 --> 16:11.797
Um, can we walk you out?

16:11.798 --> 16:12.995
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

16:12.996 --> 16:15.000
- JAY: You're enjoying the book tour?
- Uh, if by "enjoy,"

16:15.001 --> 16:16.535
you mean "enduring it
like a root canal," yes.

16:16.536 --> 16:19.004
I am much more comfortable
behind the scenes.

16:19.005 --> 16:22.874
Hmm. Well, we loved you on,
uh, <i>Word of the Nation.</i>

16:22.875 --> 16:25.043
- Oh.
- I told my daughter that I...

16:25.044 --> 16:27.980
genuinely envy your life right now.

16:27.981 --> 16:30.649
Don't tell me you're
thinking about checking out.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.384
Well, when the time comes.

16:32.385 --> 16:34.453
Well, I hope that isn't any time soon,

16:34.454 --> 16:36.688
because you are doing
what so many of us

16:36.689 --> 16:38.590
wanted to do for years.

16:38.591 --> 16:41.560
Getting Dalton to pivot
his whole foreign policy

16:41.561 --> 16:43.161
with that military base in Tunisia?

16:43.162 --> 16:44.363
That was fierce.

16:44.364 --> 16:46.465
A lot of people worked together
to make that happen.

16:46.466 --> 16:47.766
She's being modest.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.468
Stay in the game as long as you can.

16:49.469 --> 16:50.736
The farm will always be there.

16:50.737 --> 16:52.504
And I sleep a lot better
knowing that someone like you

16:52.505 --> 16:53.572
is at the switch.

16:53.573 --> 16:56.808
Well, this was
the most encouraging walk

16:56.809 --> 16:58.276
to the elevator I've ever had.

16:58.277 --> 17:00.612
And I hate to cut it short, but...

17:00.613 --> 17:02.581
(LAUGHING): No, the pleasure
was all mine. Really.

17:02.582 --> 17:04.249
Oh, listen. Um...

17:04.250 --> 17:06.585
Before I forget, and I hate
to ask you to do this,

17:06.586 --> 17:08.819
but would you sign that
to Russell Jackson for me?

17:08.820 --> 17:10.288
- Absolutely.
- (STAMMERS): Pen.

17:10.289 --> 17:12.824
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

17:12.825 --> 17:13.992
So, smallpox.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.727
You must be thinking
Russia gave it to the guy.

17:15.728 --> 17:17.128
How else could he get it, right?

17:17.130 --> 17:21.465
Except it's totally reckless,
even by Russia's standards.

17:21.467 --> 17:23.367
Then again, the guy's an Eco-warrior,

17:23.368 --> 17:25.203
and there's nothing Russia hates more

17:25.204 --> 17:26.671
than an annoying dissident
pointing out

17:26.672 --> 17:29.341
the ecological nightmare
of Russia's oil fields.

17:29.342 --> 17:30.842
We should, uh, really...

17:30.843 --> 17:32.010
But then it hit me.

17:32.011 --> 17:34.179
The oil spill in Siberia.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.647
That's how he got it.

17:35.648 --> 17:37.382
What do you mean?

17:37.383 --> 17:40.585
In Siberia, the permafrost is thawing.

17:40.586 --> 17:43.355
Unearthing all kinds of nastiness,

17:43.356 --> 17:45.390
including diseases that the
world thought were long dead.

17:45.391 --> 17:46.858
He must've gotten it

17:46.859 --> 17:48.927
when he was there taking
pictures of the oil spill.

17:48.928 --> 17:50.629
Zombie smallpox?

17:50.630 --> 17:52.330
Should we continue this
on the way down?

17:52.331 --> 17:53.865
Uh... Yeah.

17:53.866 --> 17:55.200
- Could...
- Yeah.

17:55.201 --> 17:56.735
One thing I learned
from the avocado farm,

17:56.736 --> 18:00.005
the Earth is basically
like a five-year-old.

18:00.006 --> 18:01.640
You give it everything
it wants... the best food

18:01.641 --> 18:05.010
and love and attention...
it is non-stop bounty, but...

18:05.011 --> 18:07.079
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)
you pollute it with crap,

18:07.080 --> 18:10.649
ignore all the signs that it
needs a nap and push it too far?

18:10.650 --> 18:12.484
Pretty soon, you've got
an overlooked middle child

18:12.485 --> 18:16.353
who will demand your attention
by killing the babysitter.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.425
Anyway, yeah.

18:20.426 --> 18:22.794
Permafrost. That's where I would look.

We're not gonna solve <i>this</i> today,

just leave you with one thing.

18:48.421 --> 18:49.988
In the ideological struggle

18:49.989 --> 18:52.290
between democracy
and authoritarianism,

18:52.291 --> 18:54.526
I'm not here to question
what's right or wrong,

18:54.527 --> 18:57.429
but I will point out
that there's only one

18:57.430 --> 19:00.232
that allows you to question
what's right and wrong.

19:00.233 --> 19:01.600
- (LAUGHTER)
- Okay?

19:01.601 --> 19:03.635
Thank you... very good
discussion today. Thanks.

19:03.636 --> 19:06.637
Uh, paper topics by Friday, please.

19:11.543 --> 19:15.247
You know, I'm still not convinced.

19:15.248 --> 19:17.082
Yeah, I got that, Sal.

19:17.083 --> 19:18.917
Why don't you take
it up in your paper?

19:18.918 --> 19:24.722
You know, actually, I have a
thought I'd like to run by you.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.727
I'm working on a DEA case,

19:28.728 --> 19:32.430
and a couple of weeks ago, this
FBI agent got his cover blown.

19:32.431 --> 19:35.400
Two years undercover with MS-13.

19:35.401 --> 19:38.970
Now, it got me thinking
about long-term effects

19:38.971 --> 19:43.642
of working deep cover,
and if it's moral

19:43.643 --> 19:48.647
to ask someone to pretend
to be bad for a greater good?

19:48.648 --> 19:50.415
Well, that's very good.

19:50.416 --> 19:52.350
Complicated. I look
forward to reading it.

19:52.351 --> 19:54.618
Uh, thank you, sir.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.455
Hey, Sal.

19:59.958 --> 20:02.060
This agent, did he get out okay?

20:02.061 --> 20:04.862
He got out.

Hey, Dylan.

20:19.178 --> 20:22.514
Listen, I need you
to, uh, look into a case for me.

20:22.515 --> 20:24.849
DALTON: How does an eradicated disease

20:24.850 --> 20:26.518
just show up in Siberia?

20:26.519 --> 20:31.022
Well, Mr. President, our
working theory is permafrost.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.290
The permanently frozen soil

20:32.291 --> 20:34.226
under the topsoil in Arctic regions.

20:34.227 --> 20:35.162
We're aware.

20:35.163 --> 20:37.862
Permafrost is so cold,
organic matter inside anything

20:37.863 --> 20:40.465
that dies in the Arctic
doesn't decompose.

20:40.466 --> 20:43.001
Carbon dioxide in plants,

20:43.002 --> 20:45.503
anthrax inside infected reindeer,

20:45.504 --> 20:47.572
smallpox in humans,

20:47.573 --> 20:50.809
remains frozen in the ground, dormant.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.644
JAY: Until the permafrost thaws,

20:52.645 --> 20:54.145
like it's doing in Siberia.

20:54.146 --> 20:56.615
Then, it all gets released.

20:56.616 --> 20:58.650
And the Arctic
is warming twice as fast

20:58.651 --> 21:00.418
as the rest of the planet.

21:00.419 --> 21:02.792
DALTON: So Russia
isn't weaponizing smallpox.

21:03.468 --> 21:05.155
The Earth is.

21:06.291 --> 21:10.128
If we don't act fast to work
with Russia to contain this,

21:10.129 --> 21:12.863
we could be looking
at a global pandemic.

21:14.332 --> 21:16.768
Unfortunately,
I think we're better equipped

21:16.769 --> 21:19.504
to fight Mother Russia
than Mother Nature.

21:19.505 --> 21:23.441
Well, we're about
to do battle with both.

21:23.442 --> 21:25.709
(SIGHS)

21:29.675 --> 21:32.222
Konstantin, I think there
was a misunderstanding

21:32.223 --> 21:33.456
last time we spoke.

21:33.457 --> 21:37.460
If you felt I implied in any
way that your government

21:37.461 --> 21:41.097
would deliberately infect
its own citizens with smallpox,

21:41.098 --> 21:42.098
I apologize.

21:42.099 --> 21:44.000
I had no evidence of that.

21:44.001 --> 21:45.735
I thank you.

21:45.736 --> 21:48.738
Once Artem Markevich has
recuperated and returned

21:48.739 --> 21:52.175
to Moscow, we can hopefully
put this behind us.

21:52.176 --> 21:54.110
Well, before we get to that,

21:54.111 --> 21:56.780
we need to talk about
where he got the illness.

21:56.781 --> 21:58.948
We've become aware
of the outbreak in Siberia,

21:58.949 --> 22:00.250
and we have some theories...

22:00.251 --> 22:02.652
I'm not aware of any such outbreak.

22:02.653 --> 22:04.788
Fortunately,
it seems to be manageable.

22:04.789 --> 22:06.790
And we're hoping that,
with the help of our CDC team,

22:06.791 --> 22:08.692
we can get it quickly contained.

22:08.693 --> 22:11.995
Any health crisis can be fully handled

22:11.996 --> 22:14.464
by our own health ministry.

22:14.465 --> 22:16.499
And I have to inform you,

22:16.500 --> 22:19.536
unless you agree
to return our citizen,

22:19.537 --> 22:23.673
all key U.S. diplomats
will be expelled from Russia,

22:23.674 --> 22:25.308
effective immediately.

22:25.309 --> 22:26.342
You don't want to do that.

22:26.343 --> 22:27.977
You know we have to respond.

22:27.978 --> 22:30.447
I'm afraid this is your doing,

22:30.448 --> 22:32.549

22:32.550 --> 22:34.551
Um, I'm sorry, ma'am.
The hospital called.

22:34.552 --> 22:37.319
Artem Markevich has taken
a turn for the worse.

22:38.555 --> 22:40.890
I looked into your student's story

22:40.891 --> 22:42.625
about that blown undercover agent.

22:42.626 --> 22:43.593
And?

22:43.594 --> 22:44.828
It's all pretty straightforward,

22:44.829 --> 22:46.695
but I found something else.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.269
There's an interagency task force

22:53.270 --> 22:55.171
doing a review of the entire
intelligence community.

22:55.172 --> 22:58.975
Agents blown,
assets killed or compromised.

22:58.976 --> 23:01.177
I called in a huge favor

23:01.178 --> 23:03.079
and got a list
of their initial findings.

23:03.080 --> 23:04.614
All of this in the last month?

23:04.615 --> 23:06.182
Right when Nafisa got taken.

23:06.183 --> 23:08.451
I mean, maybe it's just a coincidence.

23:08.452 --> 23:11.421
Or maybe the CIA isn't the only
agency dealing with a leak.

23:11.422 --> 23:12.689
It's got to be a hack, right?

23:12.690 --> 23:15.692
I mean, all these operations
are compartmentalized.

23:15.693 --> 23:18.394
The only people that have
security clearance high enough

23:18.395 --> 23:20.063
to know about
all these different ops...

23:20.064 --> 23:21.998
You're right. It's got to be a hack.

23:21.999 --> 23:23.999
I'll handle this from here. Thank you.

23:38.515 --> 23:41.084
I'm glad to finally
welcome you in person.

23:41.085 --> 23:42.552

23:42.553 --> 23:45.622
it's not how I imagined it.

23:45.623 --> 23:48.424
I'm so sorry for what
you're going through.

23:48.425 --> 23:52.762
You have to admire the irony.

23:52.763 --> 23:55.398

23:55.399 --> 23:58.601
and this is the thanks I get.

to limit his time with Piper

helium-filled balloons over lakes,

27:52.968 --> 27:55.303
which, uh, pump water up

27:55.304 --> 27:59.807
into a gas that then releases
heat-absorbing crystals.

27:59.808 --> 28:02.443
Are there any risk factors?

28:02.444 --> 28:04.879
Well, it's completely untested.
No one knows.

28:04.880 --> 28:08.549
Anyone have anything
a little closer to the box?

28:08.550 --> 28:10.084
KAT: Woolly mammoths!

28:10.085 --> 28:11.619
Good morning. Sorry, I'm completely

28:11.620 --> 28:13.021
out of practice with traffic.

28:13.022 --> 28:14.656
Where did all those cars come from?

28:14.657 --> 28:16.324
ELIZABETH: Everybody,

28:16.325 --> 28:17.825
this is Kat Sandoval.

28:17.826 --> 28:20.962
She is the reason we are
talking about permafrost.

28:20.963 --> 28:22.363
And woolly mammoths.

28:22.364 --> 28:25.499
Right. Okay. So...

28:27.201 --> 28:32.607
In the Arctic, you've
got your permafrost.

28:32.608 --> 28:34.709
Above that, you've got

28:34.710 --> 28:39.513
a thin layer of topsoil where
the grass grows, et cetera.

28:41.182 --> 28:43.785
During the winter, the snow

28:43.786 --> 28:47.288
piles up on the topsoil.

28:47.289 --> 28:49.090
So now you're probably thinking,
"Sweet.

28:49.091 --> 28:50.958
The snow will keep it cool."
Right? Wrong.

28:50.959 --> 28:53.494
What keeps the ground cool is

28:53.495 --> 28:56.464
the cold air blowing
through the tundra.

28:56.465 --> 29:00.401
But this snow is actually
acting like a down comforter,

29:00.402 --> 29:03.503
preventing the air
from cooling the ground.

29:05.206 --> 29:07.842
Well, back in the Ice Age,

29:07.843 --> 29:09.843
this wasn't a problem because...

29:11.546 --> 29:13.915
...woolly mammoths existed

29:13.916 --> 29:15.750
to kick the covers off

29:15.751 --> 29:18.419
by trampling the snow.

29:18.420 --> 29:22.656
This would be the extinct
woolly mammoth?

29:24.325 --> 29:27.095
There is a group of scientists
working on a mammoth clone,

29:27.096 --> 29:29.030
but we are much closer

29:29.031 --> 29:30.631
to a mammoth-elephant hybrid.

29:30.632 --> 29:32.600
ELIZABETH: So, to review, we have

29:32.601 --> 29:36.571
giant plastic blanket, gas cloud
theory that's never been tested,

29:36.572 --> 29:40.641
and reanimating prehistoric animals.

29:40.642 --> 29:43.611
It could also work with bison,
musk ox, uh, reindeer...

29:43.612 --> 29:45.513
Caribou. Yes, you feel me.

29:45.514 --> 29:47.515
We need snow tramplers.

29:47.516 --> 29:49.617
There was a study where
they reintroduced livestock

29:49.618 --> 29:51.419
to a contained area, and
the permafrost temperature

29:51.420 --> 29:52.520
was remarkably cooler.

29:52.521 --> 29:53.788
What about tanks?

29:53.789 --> 29:56.324
Would-would tanks have a similar
snow-trampling effect?

29:56.325 --> 29:58.493
Possibly, but...

29:58.494 --> 30:01.629
the whole idea is to reintroduce
Ice Age plant life, too.

30:01.630 --> 30:04.232
Reintroducing Arctic flora
and fauna...

30:04.233 --> 30:05.867
I-I can sell that.

30:05.868 --> 30:07.735
JAY: All right, we could start small,

30:07.736 --> 30:09.871
instituting pilot programs
in countries with permafrost.

30:09.872 --> 30:11.873
If there's improvement,
expand from there.

30:11.874 --> 30:14.575
We'd have to get every country
with permafrost on board.

30:14.576 --> 30:16.144
Russia has the most.

30:16.145 --> 30:19.579
Good thing we're on
such good terms with them.

30:21.315 --> 30:23.551
We checked with our climatologists.

30:23.552 --> 30:25.886
The science holds water.

30:26.754 --> 30:29.157
Ecosystem restoration could have

30:29.158 --> 30:32.160
a real effect on saving permafrost.

30:32.161 --> 30:34.461
By bringing back woolly mammoths.

30:36.130 --> 30:38.566
I don't remember
that kind of thing going well

30:38.567 --> 30:39.801
in <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

30:39.802 --> 30:42.937
We'd start with bison,
moose and reindeer.

30:42.938 --> 30:44.439
It's worth a shot.

30:44.440 --> 30:47.975
You have my okay for
a pilot program in Alaska.

30:47.976 --> 30:50.378
Okay, great. Canada is a lock.

30:50.379 --> 30:52.346
Greenland will be receptive.

30:52.347 --> 30:53.648
What about Russia?

30:53.649 --> 30:55.249
Yeah.

30:55.250 --> 30:57.985
Avdonin's ghosting me, so
I'm gonna have to go to Moscow

30:57.986 --> 31:00.988
and put it in front of him.

31:00.989 --> 31:07.127
It would help if I had
a free hand to negotiate.

31:08.863 --> 31:10.631
What are you thinking?

31:10.632 --> 31:15.102
Hold off on expelling
Russia's diplomats.

31:15.103 --> 31:16.671
I don't like
letting that go unanswered.

31:16.672 --> 31:17.905
Makes us look weak.

31:17.906 --> 31:19.106
They've already agreed

31:19.107 --> 31:21.309
to let the CDC help
contain this first outbreak.

31:21.310 --> 31:22.844
I think they're ready to bargain,

31:22.845 --> 31:26.180
especially when I tell them
about these giant bubbles

31:26.181 --> 31:29.350
of methane gas and CO2
that will be released

31:29.351 --> 31:31.552
when the permafrost finally melts,

31:31.553 --> 31:35.723
basically rendering our planet
uninhabitable.

31:35.724 --> 31:39.327
Hell, if that doesn't
convince them to try to fix it,

31:39.328 --> 31:42.195
I don't know what will.

31:43.631 --> 31:45.600
All right, Bess.

31:45.601 --> 31:47.001
Give it a shot.

31:47.002 --> 31:49.035
Thank you, sir.

31:49.509 --> 31:50.571
HENRY: <i>So, Moscow.</i>

31:50.572 --> 31:52.306
Anything I need to know?

31:52.307 --> 31:55.576
No. Another climate initiative.

31:55.577 --> 31:57.879
Let's hope maybe this one
does something.

31:57.880 --> 32:01.582
Oh, hey, how'd the talk go with Keats?

32:01.583 --> 32:03.518
Oh, it hasn't happened yet.

32:03.519 --> 32:05.987
Henry, come on.
I'm getting a little antsy here.

32:05.988 --> 32:07.822
Could you get it done by the weekend?

32:07.823 --> 32:08.890
Definitely, yeah.

32:08.891 --> 32:10.358
Uh, you know, it's not gonna be

32:10.359 --> 32:12.260
the same talk you gave
the girls, exactly.

32:12.261 --> 32:14.428
Why not?

32:14.429 --> 32:16.764
Well, you know, I thought
I'd... do the basics.

32:16.765 --> 32:18.499
Risk of pregnancy, STDs...

32:18.500 --> 32:19.767
Not letting yourself get pressured

32:19.768 --> 32:21.836
into anything you're not ready for,

32:21.837 --> 32:23.304
giving and getting consent.

32:23.305 --> 32:24.505
- All that's the same.
- True.

32:24.506 --> 32:26.674
And then I would get
into how physical intimacy

32:26.675 --> 32:28.576
is all tied in
with emotional intimacy.

32:28.577 --> 32:30.211
I mean, how that can feel really good,

32:30.212 --> 32:31.979
but it can also really
break your heart.

32:31.980 --> 32:34.482
I mean, ending a,
uh, sexual relationship

32:34.483 --> 32:37.285
is a lot more difficult
than ending a nonsexual one.

32:37.286 --> 32:40.187
You know what, maybe we
should do this together.

32:40.188 --> 32:41.789
Really?

32:41.790 --> 32:43.113
Because I was getting very okay

32:43.114 --> 32:44.554
with you doing it by yourself.

32:44.555 --> 32:46.193
No, you were right, you were right.

32:46.194 --> 32:48.663
I think he could benefit
from your perspective.

32:48.664 --> 32:50.798
- How much time do you have?
- You want to do it now?

32:50.799 --> 32:52.466
No, I can't.

32:52.467 --> 32:54.390
I mean, I have to be out
the door in ten minutes.

32:54.391 --> 32:55.341
Well, that's perfect.

32:55.342 --> 32:57.572
No time to overthink. Just in and out.

32:57.573 --> 33:00.708
So to speak.

33:00.709 --> 33:02.076
Okay.

33:02.077 --> 33:04.944
(CLAPS HANDS)

33:07.615 --> 33:09.684
Jace, the thing we're
trying to say to you is...

33:09.685 --> 33:11.552
- Sex kills.
- What?

33:11.553 --> 33:15.456
What-what Mom means is
that when-when you have sex,

33:15.457 --> 33:17.224
there are consequences
that you might not be

33:17.225 --> 33:19.360
- ready to deal with.
- Things that could alter the whole rest of your life.

33:19.361 --> 33:21.329
I mean, it's emotional.
It's thrilling.

33:21.330 --> 33:24.332
But you got to think about
things like, you know,

33:24.333 --> 33:25.533
unwanted pregnancy and diseases...

33:25.534 --> 33:27.134
Guys, we're not having sex.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.804
- What was that?
- You're not?

33:29.805 --> 33:32.206
No, I... (SCOFFS)

33:32.207 --> 33:35.710
Okay, Piper feels that when
you have a spiritual connection

33:35.711 --> 33:38.145
like we do, sex isn't necessary,

33:38.146 --> 33:40.313
so we're-we're just
kind of above that.

33:42.016 --> 33:43.718
Are we good?

33:43.719 --> 33:46.686
- Yup, we're good.
- I think that covers it. Yeah.

33:48.723 --> 33:52.025
Piper's parents beat us to the punch.

33:53.628 --> 33:55.730
Good messaging, though.

33:55.731 --> 33:57.798
"Sex kills"?

33:57.799 --> 33:59.500
I know. I saw the
ten-year-old and I panicked.

33:59.501 --> 34:02.205
- That's good messaging? Sex...
- I know...

34:09.369 --> 34:12.672
Boy, Kat, you are a
difficult person to find.

34:12.672 --> 34:16.643
And I'm sorry to intrude and
I promise from now on out,

34:16.643 --> 34:18.811
all of our conversations
will be about avocados

34:18.812 --> 34:21.147
and how incredibly cool your hair is.

34:21.148 --> 34:23.550
But right now I have a plane
waiting for me on the tarmac

34:23.551 --> 34:26.585
and I have been over
and over the research.

34:26.587 --> 34:27.786
Hang on a second.

34:27.788 --> 34:29.956
Can I get a coffee to
go, please? Thank you.

34:29.956 --> 34:31.757
- Why don't you try a veggie kebab?
- I don't have time.

34:31.759 --> 34:34.460
I can't. You know, okay.

34:34.460 --> 34:37.530
Um, can you, can you add
a kebab to that order?

34:37.531 --> 34:39.831
Thank you.

34:40.699 --> 34:41.801
You were looking at the research.

34:41.802 --> 34:43.835
For the woolly mammoth
initiative. Right.

34:43.837 --> 34:46.306
So...

34:46.306 --> 34:50.009
I understand science
and I know that we...

34:50.010 --> 34:52.812
There you go.

34:52.813 --> 34:54.847
...I know I can get
Russia to sign off.

34:54.848 --> 34:56.716
But I don't want this to be a thing

34:56.717 --> 34:59.185
where they agree for the optics

34:59.186 --> 35:01.421
and then nothing really happens.

35:01.422 --> 35:04.023
I mean, how do we make this agreement

35:04.024 --> 35:08.027
something that Russia actually
wants to follow through on?

35:08.028 --> 35:11.064
Um, because a smallpox outbreak

35:11.065 --> 35:13.199
or the fact that everything built

35:13.200 --> 35:15.168
on top of permafrost can...

35:15.169 --> 35:17.069
(LAUGHING): drop into
a sinkhole isn't enough?

35:18.040 --> 35:20.640
- Here's what we're up against.
- Hmm?

35:20.641 --> 35:24.777
Melting permafrost makes
Arctic oil easier to drill.

35:24.778 --> 35:28.214
Right.

35:28.215 --> 35:29.949
(SIGHS)

35:29.950 --> 35:32.117
Okay.

35:33.886 --> 35:36.688
Peat moss.

35:38.958 --> 35:41.361
ELIZABETH: <i>Peat moss.</i>

35:41.362 --> 35:45.531
Or as you like to call it,
<i>torfjanoj moh.</i>

35:45.532 --> 35:47.367
The magic stuff that
you put in gardens

35:47.368 --> 35:49.269
and it makes everything grow.

35:49.270 --> 35:51.704
Yes, we have used it as fuel.

35:51.705 --> 35:52.905
I know, right?

35:52.906 --> 35:56.242
So many uses, which is
why it gets overmined.

35:56.243 --> 35:59.379
You know what else
peat moss is great for?

35:59.380 --> 36:02.915
Keeping the ground temperature stable.

36:02.916 --> 36:04.917
So, whereas

36:04.918 --> 36:08.855
a blanket of snow
warms the permafrost,

36:08.856 --> 36:12.358
a layer of peat on
top of the permafrost

36:12.359 --> 36:15.995
acts like insulation, so the
ground doesn't warm or cool.

36:15.996 --> 36:18.031
It just stays stable.

36:18.032 --> 36:19.198
That's what we need.

36:19.199 --> 36:20.533
What are you asking?

36:20.534 --> 36:24.737
Next to Canada, Russia
has the second largest

36:24.738 --> 36:27.006
area of peat bogs in the world.

36:27.007 --> 36:29.909
Now, I-I know that Russia needs access

36:29.910 --> 36:31.644
to its natural resources,

36:31.645 --> 36:34.681
so we're not asking
you to stop drilling.

36:34.682 --> 36:38.251
But if you can agree to avoid
the areas where there's peat

36:38.252 --> 36:41.054
and work to preserve what remains,

36:41.055 --> 36:44.924
that will buy us all another
100 years on this planet.

36:44.925 --> 36:46.528
Of course, if we work together,

36:46.529 --> 36:47.914
we could buy more time than that.

36:47.915 --> 36:53.019
As much as I appreciate this
personal appeal, Elizabeth,

36:53.020 --> 36:55.555
- the situation with the...
- No, I know, I know.

36:55.556 --> 36:58.258
We're not in a great
position right now

36:58.259 --> 36:59.659
to be asking for favors.

36:59.660 --> 37:03.796
But in the spirit of reconciliation,

37:03.797 --> 37:07.600
President Dalton has agreed
not to expel your diplomats

37:07.601 --> 37:11.336
if we can come to an
agreement on this.

37:12.772 --> 37:13.973
I mean, come on, why don't you say

37:13.974 --> 37:16.743
we take a step to save the planet

37:16.744 --> 37:19.879
and bring our countries back together?

37:19.880 --> 37:22.147
(SIGHS)

37:24.183 --> 37:25.718
Okay.

37:25.719 --> 37:29.555
Elizabeth, I pledge to do
everything in my power

37:29.556 --> 37:33.658
to ensure our participation
in your program.

37:35.428 --> 37:37.997
I have to tell you...

37:37.998 --> 37:41.401
this agreement only applies
to this deal.

37:41.402 --> 37:44.302
We're still expelling your diplomats.

37:53.546 --> 37:57.917
It is with great pride
that Canada joins the U.S.,

37:57.918 --> 38:01.788
Greenland, Russia and China
in this groundbreaking... _

38:01.789 --> 38:04.657
or maybe we should say
ground-freezing...

38:04.658 --> 38:09.028
initiative to protect our permafrost.

38:09.029 --> 38:11.431
Thank you, Jonas.

(REPORTERS CLAMORING)

38:19.839 --> 38:21.274
What's this?

38:21.275 --> 38:23.643
Just a little something to
celebrate the successful launch

38:23.644 --> 38:25.812
of the Permafrost Protection Project.

38:25.813 --> 38:28.281
I thought popsicles were more
appropriate than champagne.

38:28.282 --> 38:30.350
Could've gotten champagne popsicles.

If it doesn't, it should.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.954
- Yeah.
- You know what's surprising?

38:34.955 --> 38:38.725
9:00 a.m. is not too
early for popsicles.

38:38.726 --> 38:40.727
Ma'am, the press conference
is confirmed for noon.

38:40.728 --> 38:41.995
Also, just a reminder,
you have Kat Sandoval

38:41.996 --> 38:43.363
waiting in your office for you.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.798
Final policy advisor interviews
at 11:00.

38:45.799 --> 38:47.033
I know, I know.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.836
I'm going to pull the trigger
on that today. Promise.

38:49.837 --> 38:53.473
It's great to see you again.

38:53.474 --> 38:55.041
I was just heading back
to California and I wanted

38:55.042 --> 38:56.309
to congratulate you.

38:56.310 --> 38:58.711
- I heard Project Woolly Mammoth is a go.
- Yes.

38:58.712 --> 39:01.080
We managed to get full participation.

39:01.081 --> 39:03.016
Well, 'cause you didn't call
it Project Woolly Mammoth.

39:03.017 --> 39:04.384
Because we had your help.

39:04.385 --> 39:05.985
Thank you, really, for everything.

39:05.986 --> 39:07.253
Oh, please.

39:07.254 --> 39:09.689
Oh, also, I wanted to give you this.

39:09.690 --> 39:12.025
You can keep the joke
copy for Russell Jackson.

39:12.026 --> 39:14.027
I know he thinks I'm nuts,
but this one's for you.

39:14.028 --> 39:18.297
Good luck on the avocado farm.

39:18.298 --> 39:20.400
Uh, could we have a word?

39:20.401 --> 39:22.735
Yes, of course. Sure.

39:22.736 --> 39:25.003
(CLEARS THROAT)

39:26.773 --> 39:28.274
KAT: <i>I hate the farm.</i>

39:28.275 --> 39:32.378
Avocados, they make no sense.

39:32.379 --> 39:35.481
I thought they did, but they don't.

39:35.482 --> 39:38.885
But working with you this week...

39:38.886 --> 39:40.987
that made sense.

39:40.988 --> 39:46.225
Well, now I'm really confused
because, I mean, I thought...

39:46.226 --> 39:47.994
No, I know, I know. I know.

39:47.995 --> 39:50.029
(LAUGHING): I wrote a whole book

39:50.030 --> 39:53.666
about how the farm saved me and
I completely meant it because,

39:53.667 --> 39:54.967
I don't know if you've heard,

39:54.968 --> 39:57.103
but, uh, I am nothing
if not fully committed.

39:57.104 --> 39:59.672
(CHUCKLES) I might've heard
something about that.

39:59.673 --> 40:01.040
Yeah, about those stories.

40:01.041 --> 40:03.576
They're all true.

40:03.577 --> 40:06.979
Well, they do keep
getting one part wrong.

40:06.980 --> 40:08.947
I didn't throw a chair.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.952
I threw a table...

40:12.953 --> 40:15.288
at a chair...

40:15.289 --> 40:17.890
of the Armed Services Committee.

40:17.891 --> 40:21.828
We had just been, uh, traveling
through Southeast Asia,

40:21.829 --> 40:23.930
setting up aid programs
when I found out this guy

40:23.931 --> 40:25.898
had let himself get bribed

40:25.899 --> 40:29.302
in the... the dumbest way imaginable

40:29.303 --> 40:32.338
and I just lost it.

40:32.339 --> 40:34.774
Do I regret it? Of course.

40:34.775 --> 40:37.510
And I worked like hell to get
those people to trust me again,

40:37.511 --> 40:39.378
but the problem was
I didn't trust them.

40:39.379 --> 40:41.214
The day I quit was the day I realized

40:41.215 --> 40:43.615
I didn't want to have
to throw furniture anymore.

40:46.319 --> 40:48.020
But then you tracked me
down at a pita place

40:48.021 --> 40:49.522
to talk about permafrost...

40:49.523 --> 40:51.324
Yeah, sorry about ambushing your meal.

40:51.325 --> 40:52.492
No, no, no, I loved it.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.860
You knew you didn't have it yet

40:53.861 --> 40:56.262
and you weren't gonna
stop until you did.

40:56.263 --> 40:58.263
Do you know how rare that is?

40:59.332 --> 41:02.802
Look, all I wanted to say was

41:02.803 --> 41:05.071
I know you're looking
for a policy advisor

41:05.072 --> 41:06.606
and I want to throw my hat
in the ring.

41:06.607 --> 41:11.844
I am open-minded but decisive.

41:11.845 --> 41:15.648
I will walk through fire
to make things happen for you

41:15.649 --> 41:19.618
and I promise my furniture-
throwing days are over.

41:21.354 --> 41:25.223
You had me at permafrost.

41:27.860 --> 41:33.399
She actually threw a
table at a senator.

41:33.400 --> 41:38.637
I mean, how often is the real
story even worse than the rumor?

41:40.139 --> 41:43.276
You think I'm crazy for hiring her.

41:43.277 --> 41:44.977
What?

41:44.978 --> 41:46.846
Sorry.

41:46.847 --> 41:49.115
Look, I think I need to talk.

41:49.116 --> 41:51.083
It's about the leak

41:51.084 --> 41:53.618
that led to Nafisa being taken.

41:55.321 --> 41:57.190
Who was it?

41:57.191 --> 41:58.391
I still don't know.

41:58.392 --> 42:00.159
There's a task force
looking at the agents

42:00.160 --> 42:02.394
being blown in multiple departments.

42:04.096 --> 42:06.465
Okay. So, they're looking into it.

42:06.466 --> 42:08.668
- That's good.
- But the blown ops,

42:08.669 --> 42:11.971
in order to have access
to that level of Intel,

42:11.972 --> 42:13.873
you'd have to be
on the president's cabinet.

42:13.874 --> 42:15.173
Which is crazy.

42:16.876 --> 42:19.144
I know.

42:22.014 --> 42:24.515
That leaves only eight
other people it could be.

42:24.516 --> 42:25.598
Henry.

42:25.599 --> 42:28.254
Someone in the Congressional
Gang of Eight

42:28.255 --> 42:30.823
could be selling out our country.

42:30.824 --> 42:34.126
I don't know who. I don't know why.

42:34.127 --> 42:38.263
And I hope to hell I'm wrong,
but what if I'm not?
