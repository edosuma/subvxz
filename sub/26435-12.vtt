00:07.400 --> 00:10.791
Alpha: [Whispering]
They made you remove your skin?

00:10.880 --> 00:13.679
Lydia: [Whispering]
They took it off me, hid it.

00:13.760 --> 00:19.073
The one who made the trade?

00:19.160 --> 00:22.118
He was ready to fight to keep you.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.838
Why?

00:27.120 --> 00:29.509
I acted like I needed his help.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.036
Did he touch you?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.793
No.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.759
Did you tell him about us?

00:41.840 --> 00:46.198
That there are only a few of us.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.433
That I hated living like this.

00:50.520 --> 00:54.309
I lied to get them to trust me.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.473
Except for one thing.

00:58.560 --> 01:00.756
I said they shouldn't cross you.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.196
What did you find out?

01:08.280 --> 01:12.877
They have mostly farmland.

01:12.960 --> 01:15.839
Some supplies.

01:15.920 --> 01:18.196
Their weapons are basic.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.592
A few guns but not enough.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.717
Any signs of trade?

01:26.200 --> 01:27.759
No.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.877
I don't think, no.

01:29.960 --> 01:31.837
What else?

01:31.920 --> 01:33.957
That's it.

01:34.040 --> 01:36.156
That's it?!

01:36.280 --> 01:39.955
I broke my own rules
comin' to get you.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.395
What do I get in return?

01:42.480 --> 01:44.630
Excuses.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.791
Wasted words.

01:49.440 --> 01:50.714
Sorry, Alpha.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.399
Is that the only reason
you came to get me?

01:59.480 --> 02:00.959
To get information?

02:04.200 --> 02:05.713
What a stupid question.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.118
Who else knew about this?

03:21.200 --> 03:23.953
Gabriel: Just Eugene and Rosita.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.077
We would've told you
if we'd found someone out there,

03:26.160 --> 03:27.434
but we didn't.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.233
Then who knows
who else was listening?

03:29.320 --> 03:30.958
We weren't being careless with it.

03:32.920 --> 03:36.436
Rosita and Eugene
went out to set up this relay

03:36.520 --> 03:38.352
and almost died because of it.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.239
Jesus <i>did</i> die because of it.

03:41.320 --> 03:44.472
Negan got out
while you were distracted

03:44.560 --> 03:47.791
because of it!

03:47.880 --> 03:49.200
I can't do my job

03:49.280 --> 03:51.749
if the council
is keeping things from me.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.672
We gave you the power to veto the council

03:53.760 --> 03:55.592
based on security concerns,

03:55.680 --> 03:58.354
but now everything is a security concern.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.794
So our votes don't matter anymore,

03:59.880 --> 04:01.359
unless you agree with them.

04:01.440 --> 04:04.319
Putting ourselves out there
when we don't have to

04:04.400 --> 04:05.720
is dangerous!

04:05.800 --> 04:09.759
So is cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.956
Who are we supposed to turn to
when we need help?

04:12.040 --> 04:14.316
We can't be so worried
about finding enemies

04:14.440 --> 04:15.669
that we lose our friends.

04:15.760 --> 04:17.512
Aaron: And we did lose a friend.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.389
Look, we all set out
with the best of intentions,

04:25.480 --> 04:27.391
but that doesn't change what happened.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.710
There's a new enemy out there,

04:29.800 --> 04:31.154
and they're exactly

04:31.240 --> 04:37.270
what Michonne was afraid we'd find.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.271
I don't regret the time

04:39.360 --> 04:42.273
that I spent out there
with Jesusâ€œ I don't.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.432
And what happened...

04:45.520 --> 04:47.511
Maybe that would've happened anyway.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.950
Maybe.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.759
But now we know what's out there,

04:52.840 --> 04:58.153
and we can't pretend otherwise.

04:58.240 --> 05:01.119
We put Michonne in charge of security

05:01.200 --> 05:03.760
for a reason.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.356
Her judgment has saved us
time and again.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.954
Yes, but at what cost?

05:12.960 --> 05:17.716
We saw Carol
when we were at the Hilltop.

05:17.800 --> 05:18.949
And she told me

05:19.040 --> 05:20.872
that she tried asking Michonne

05:20.960 --> 05:22.792
for help with the fair again,

05:22.880 --> 05:25.156
and she said that you turned her down.

05:25.240 --> 05:28.073
You spoke on behalf of Alexandria?

05:28.160 --> 05:30.754
The question of the trade fair
is old business.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.719
Yes, but we have new information.

05:33.800 --> 05:36.952
Look, the fair starts
the day after tomorrow,

05:37.040 --> 05:39.634
and it's not too late to reconsider.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.954
Carol says that the situation
at the Kingdom

05:49.040 --> 05:52.795
is far worse than
Ezekiel let on in his letter.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.917
They're too isolated,

05:55.040 --> 05:58.032
and they need the trade
that this fair will bring.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.077
The Kingdom can take care of itself.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.514
They always have.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.830
Carol wouldn't ask for help
a second time

06:03.920 --> 06:05.069
if it wasn't serious.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.879
I motion the council
take a second vote

06:07.960 --> 06:09.519
on the Kingdom's fair.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.795
Gabriel: To what end?

06:10.880 --> 06:13.633
- She'd just veto it.
- Michonne: I would.

06:13.720 --> 06:18.476
The roads leading there
are broken and dangerous,

06:18.560 --> 06:22.519
and there is a group
dressed as the dead

06:22.600 --> 06:24.477
who are trying to kill us.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.871
[Sighs]

06:27.960 --> 06:31.749
Look, I wish we could help them, too,

06:31.840 --> 06:34.275
and we could vote

06:34.360 --> 06:36.112
to open up our doors to our friends

06:36.200 --> 06:38.760
just like we did with the people
of the Sanctuary.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.639
I could get behind that.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.870
But Carol made it clear in her letter

06:43.960 --> 06:46.270
that Ezekiel is not ready
to give up the Kingdom,

06:46.360 --> 06:51.275
and I'm not ready to risk
Alexandrian lives over this.

06:51.360 --> 06:56.070
I know that you just want
what's best for us.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.118
But what does it mean
for Alexandria to survive

06:59.200 --> 07:01.874
if it means that the Kingdom falls?

07:04.480 --> 07:08.633
It means Alexandria survives.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.676
[Door opens, closes]

07:27.680 --> 07:30.354
[Sighs]

07:31.600 --> 07:33.955
[Exhales sharply]

07:34.040 --> 07:36.156
Oh, come on.

07:36.240 --> 07:41.269
Oh, damn it.

07:41.360 --> 07:43.158
[Sighs]

07:43.240 --> 07:44.799
[Door opens, closes]

07:44.880 --> 07:46.678
[Thuds]

07:54.680 --> 07:58.719
[Exhales sharply]

07:58.800 --> 08:03.829
<i>H9'!-</i>

08:03.960 --> 08:06.190
Looks like it went well.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.749
Oh, yeah.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.109
I'm the leader of a council

08:10.200 --> 08:11.315
that isn't really a council anymore,

08:11.400 --> 08:13.630
so there's that.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.911
What'd she say?

08:24.680 --> 08:26.876
If it's all right with you,
I'd rather not talk about it.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.430
[Chuckles]

08:31.480 --> 08:33.039
I'm sorry.

08:33.120 --> 08:35.395
I know I'm being difficult.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.039
I'm not trying to be.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.551
It's just, it's a lot.

08:40.640 --> 08:42.198
I know.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.351
It's okay.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.033
I'm sorry, too.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.077
What for?

08:48.160 --> 08:52.233
I mean, we were just getting started.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.960
You know, you didn't sign up for this.

08:55.040 --> 09:01.355
Thing is, I-l didn't, either,
but... it's happening.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.000
It's a good thing, you know?

09:04.080 --> 09:05.753
A blessing.

09:05.840 --> 09:10.232
But if it's too much
and you want to walk,

09:10.360 --> 09:15.036
I get it.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.394
Is that what you want?

09:16.480 --> 09:18.835
No, don't be an idiot.
You know what I want.

09:21.560 --> 09:22.789
Me and Siddiq, we'll figure our shit out,

09:22.880 --> 09:27.113
but you and I, how we handle it...

09:27.200 --> 09:28.634
the ball's in your court.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.473
I'm gonna go home.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.594
[Door opens, closes]

09:48.760 --> 09:53.152
[All whispering]

11:09.400 --> 11:11.596
[Whispering] Put it down, boy.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.159
[Grunts]

11:17.080 --> 11:19.356
[Both grunting]

11:19.440 --> 11:21.556
NO! No!

11:21.640 --> 11:24.029
[Grunts, exhales sharply]

11:25.840 --> 11:28.559
Beta: Been tracking him since the glades.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.553
- He's been tracking us longer.
- Just him?

11:31.640 --> 11:33.916
Just him.

11:34.000 --> 11:38.153
Thank you, Beta.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.878
Who are you?

11:44.240 --> 11:46.629
Aah! [Grunts]

11:46.720 --> 11:48.119
I'll let him break it.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.077
And the other one.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.515
Then, your legs.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.159
And then I'll leave you out here

11:54.240 --> 11:58.199
to feed the hungry ones.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.470
Ohh! Okay!

12:00.560 --> 12:02.676
Okay, just s-stop.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.953
I'm from Hilltop.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.150
But they didn't send me.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.715
I came for her.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.155
You're so stupid.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.719
[Grunts]

12:31.080 --> 12:32.639
He's coming with us.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.277
Eyes open.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.518
Where there's one, there's more.

13:04.600 --> 13:08.355
Gabriel: Eugene, what can I do for you?

13:08.440 --> 13:12.149
The pertinent question is,
what can I do for you?

13:17.600 --> 13:18.874
In this first chart,

13:18.960 --> 13:20.519
the left column enumerates

13:20.600 --> 13:22.079
many of the positive
and negative aspects

13:22.160 --> 13:23.833
of staying with Rosita
while she raises her progeny

13:23.920 --> 13:25.911
with another man.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.229
In the right column,

13:27.320 --> 13:29.072
I've assigned each of these aspects

13:29.200 --> 13:31.999
with a corresponding positive
or negative numeric value.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.918
Then, on chart number two...

13:34.040 --> 13:36.793
Chart number two?

13:36.880 --> 13:39.030
...I've taken the numeric values
from chart one

13:39.120 --> 13:41.157
and estimated their impact over time.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.595
While there is some instability
in the first few years,

13:43.680 --> 13:46.035
happiness shows
a definitive growth pattern

13:46.120 --> 13:49.033
when projected over the long term.

13:49.120 --> 13:53.796
Well...

13:53.880 --> 13:55.154
thank you for this.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.799
I've also brought along

13:56.880 --> 13:59.156
my scoring rubric
and evaluative criteria,

13:59.240 --> 14:02.232
if that would be helpful.

14:02.360 --> 14:05.398
Yeah, I, um...

14:05.480 --> 14:07.994
I don't think it would be.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.393
All right.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.992
But if you'll pardon my French,

14:23.080 --> 14:28.712
you being a man of the cloth and all...

14:28.800 --> 14:30.950
you'd be a damn fool to let her go.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.796
Listen, we've been through
the stew, me and you.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.712
You never gave up on me
even when I did.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.871
Even with bad peepers,
you saw things I didn't.

14:40.960 --> 14:44.715
So let me kick what I'm seein'.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.598
Rosita is the best thing
that's happened to you

14:46.680 --> 14:48.114
since this whole shit storm started,

14:48.240 --> 14:49.992
so you'd do well to ponder
long and hard about this

14:50.080 --> 14:51.354
before tossing the literal baby

14:51.440 --> 14:52.714
out with the proverbial bath water.

14:52.800 --> 14:57.112
But I'm not the father.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.838
I can't let my feelings get in the way

14:58.920 --> 15:00.274
of what's best for this child.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.556
That ain't for you to say.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.870
Or Siddiq.

15:04.960 --> 15:09.909
It's her decision--
pretty much all hers.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.957
Look, I'll admit--
I don't entirely understand it.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.954
But Rosita loves you, not Siddiq.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.998
Certainly not yours truly,

15:19.080 --> 15:21.594
despite my being head over
hammertoes in love with her.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.470
So...

15:29.560 --> 15:33.155
[Breathes deeply]

15:33.240 --> 15:34.674
You need to put your hang-ups
on the back burner

15:34.760 --> 15:35.909
and figure out how to make this work,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.116
for her sake.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.793
You love each other.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.393
Stop wasting time.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.914
It's all we have in the end.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.752
Time or love?

15:44.880 --> 15:46.598
Both.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.960
What's this?

15:54.040 --> 15:57.670
It's a peace offering for Rosita
from you to her.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.593
I turned up some pantalones
with super-stretchy waistbands

16:00.680 --> 16:03.069
for her soon-to-be-
ever-expanding bread basket.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.877
Thank you.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.236
De nada.

16:14.320 --> 16:17.790
Alpha: Know why your friend
decided to follow you?

16:17.880 --> 16:19.154
Lydia: He's not my friend.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.436
He was in the cell next to mine.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.158
All I know is his name.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.713
Henry.

16:29.840 --> 16:33.515
You didn't mention Henry.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.716
He didn't seem worth mentioning.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.398
He thought it was worth risking his life

16:40.480 --> 16:42.391
chasing after you.

16:44.480 --> 16:49.190
I acted helpless, and he fell for it.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.716
Guess he's dumber than I thought.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.711
[Chuckles]

16:57.800 --> 17:00.189
Don't sell yourself short.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.832
Maybe you're just a good liar.

17:12.119 --> 17:15.271
Know why I trust animals?

17:15.359 --> 17:17.795
Because they don't lie.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.797
You had to lie.

17:22.880 --> 17:25.520
So did they.

17:25.599 --> 17:27.511
It's what they do.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.000
They're just words.

17:33.080 --> 17:37.631
Air. Nothing more.

17:37.720 --> 17:41.076
Remember that.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.269
You're back where you belong.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.195
This is your camp?

18:53.280 --> 18:54.873
It's home.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.155
For now.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.070
Get her a new skin.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.480

[Door opens, closes]

19:51.760 --> 19:52.909
Welcome home.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.195
Michonne: [Sighs]

19:55.960 --> 19:58.998
I'm surprised it took so long.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.673
I want answers.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.519
And I'm told you'll only
give them to me.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.319
So... tell me.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.152
Why the hell did you come back?

20:08.240 --> 20:10.151
'Cause I know for damn sure
it wasn't for nothing.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.753
Well, in fairness to Gabe,

20:11.840 --> 20:13.877
it wasn't all his fault that I got out.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.190
You can't keep a big dog
locked up forever.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.237
Sooner or later, he's got to run.

20:18.360 --> 20:20.476
Yeah, but you ran back.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.551
So what kind of dog does that make you?

20:22.640 --> 20:25.439
I'm glad you asked.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.278
You know I was in your home.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.432
I could've waited there.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.794
Bashed your head in

20:39.880 --> 20:41.234
when you walked through the door.

20:41.320 --> 20:44.278
Hell, I could've bashed in
a whole lot of heads.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.794
But I didn't.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.871
Because you knew you'd be
a dead man if you tried.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.679
You're an asshole, not an idiot.

20:50.760 --> 20:56.790
No, I think you decided
to take your shot out there,

20:56.880 --> 20:58.632
and "out there" spit you out,

20:58.720 --> 21:01.678
so you dragged your pathetic ass

21:01.760 --> 21:04.479
right back here.

[Chuckles]

21:05.600 --> 21:07.079
That's it, isn't it?

21:07.200 --> 21:11.751
Well, you're right--
the world has changed.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.798
But the thing is...

21:14.880 --> 21:16.393
I've changed, too.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.073
What do you want?

21:18.160 --> 21:19.912
If you're not gonna kill me,

21:20.000 --> 21:22.879
then maybe you could learn
to trust me a little bit.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.758
[Chuckles] Wow.

21:24.840 --> 21:27.070
Wow.

21:27.160 --> 21:29.515
You choose self-preservation
over revenge,

21:29.640 --> 21:31.870
and you think that earns you my trust?

21:32.800 --> 21:34.438
Wow.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.200
If spouting fresh bullshit
counts as change,

21:37.280 --> 21:39.794
congratulations, Negan,
you are a new man.

21:39.880 --> 21:43.714
You're keeping me in here
to remind everybody

21:43.800 --> 21:47.191
how merciful the great Rick Grimes was.

21:47.280 --> 21:48.509
But I am telling you,

21:48.600 --> 21:50.352
I can be so much more than that.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.078
I can help you.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.197
I don't need anything you're selling.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.396
You have a really good thing
going for you here,

21:56.480 --> 21:58.915
but it is slipping through your fingers.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.274
And it is only a matter of time

22:00.360 --> 22:01.998
before you lose control of it completely.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.195
Where are you getting this?

22:03.280 --> 22:05.635
My windows to the world

22:05.760 --> 22:07.353
are right outside your meeting room.

22:07.440 --> 22:08.714
I'm not deaf. I hear things.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.518
Well, you heard wrong.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.389
Look, all I'm saying is,

22:15.520 --> 22:19.559
I know a thing or two
about keeping people in line.

I could be a sounding board for you.

I'm not the leader here.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.991
Oh, come on.

22:31.080 --> 22:33.754
Now, I heard you wrote up
some constitution

22:33.840 --> 22:36.434
that supposedly gives power
to the people,

22:36.520 --> 22:38.318
and yet you've got it

22:38.400 --> 22:42.394
so you're the one
that makes all the decisions.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.914
Shit.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.593
That's one hell of a racket.

- I wish I --
- It's not a racket.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.754
And you don't know shit
about what goes on here.

uses everything to their advantage.

Fine.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.435
You must've gotten there late...

31:08.520 --> 31:11.672
seeing as you were standing
on the stairs outside the jail

31:11.760 --> 31:14.912

31:15.000 --> 31:16.718
Just a couple minutes.

Why were you spying on me?

31:22.520 --> 31:23.840
I wasn't.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.151
I went there to see Negan.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.198
Have you been talking to him?

31:39.440 --> 31:40.430
Why?

31:40.520 --> 31:43.433
I feel sorry for him.

31:43.520 --> 31:47.400
He is not your friend, sweetheart.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.675
Well, obviously.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.029
So if he's not your friend,

31:50.120 --> 31:51.918
then why are you talking to him?

31:55.600 --> 31:57.477
He listens to me.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.672
Not everybody does.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.669
I don't want you
to ever go near him again.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.752
Why not?

32:11.840 --> 32:14.593
There's a reason
that he's in a cage, Judith.

32:14.680 --> 32:17.832
- He is a monster.
- No, he's not.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.911
He's a human being.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.714
But he has done monstrous things.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.395
He's killed people,

32:26.480 --> 32:30.394
people I cared about,
people your dad cared about.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.596
And if we ever let him out,

32:32.720 --> 32:35.030
it would start all over again.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.554
But, Mom, he <i>did</i> get out.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.239

just for a minute.

we found her in the closet,

tangled up in the plastic
from the dry-cleaner.

34:53.880 --> 34:57.430

so she'd remember
never to do it again.

even from themselves.

from the outside, too.

35:53.920 --> 35:57.436
Having him gives us an advantage.

35:57.520 --> 36:01.798
He can be useful with Lydia, too.

36:01.880 --> 36:04.394
If she feels something,

36:04.480 --> 36:07.950
someone like him,

36:08.040 --> 36:11.590
from somewhere like that...

36:11.680 --> 36:15.389
you need to know.

36:15.480 --> 36:18.313
So let's find out.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.279
[Whispering] Leave it there.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.476
We'll come to you.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.035
[Knock on door]

38:00.760 --> 38:02.433
Hi!

38:02.520 --> 38:04.238
Hi, Gracie. ls your daddy home?

38:04.320 --> 38:06.231
Daddy, it's Michonne!

38:09.560 --> 38:11.517
<i>H9'!-</i>

38:11.640 --> 38:13.950
Um, Gracie, go on inside
and play, okay?

38:14.040 --> 38:15.360
I'll be there in a minute.

38:20.320 --> 38:23.631
What's going on?

38:23.720 --> 38:25.518
I wanted to thank you.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.034
For your support at the meeting.

38:27.120 --> 38:28.315
I'm sure that wasn't easy.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.471
It was, actually.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.598
You know, we all agreed on the rules.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.911
We agreed to live by them.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.031
After a while, I think it was easy

38:39.120 --> 38:42.158
for us to forget why we had them
in the first place.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.039
But the way things
have gone down recently,

38:45.120 --> 38:48.590
uh, made me remember.

38:51.440 --> 38:56.276
I appreciate that.

38:56.360 --> 38:59.591
Which is why I wanted to tell you first.

39:01.320 --> 39:02.833
[Sighs]

39:02.920 --> 39:05.912
If the council wants to revote

39:06.000 --> 39:09.994
to send a delegation to the fair...

39:10.080 --> 39:11.434
I won't veto it.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.593
What about the ones with the skins?

39:15.680 --> 39:17.114
If our people cross with them,

39:17.200 --> 39:18.873
they-- they'll be risking their lives.

39:19.000 --> 39:22.311
I think it's a terrible idea.

39:22.400 --> 39:27.839
But... the people
can weigh the risks and choose.

39:27.920 --> 39:31.436
That's their right.

39:31.520 --> 39:34.990
That's the charter they agreed to.

39:35.080 --> 39:37.117
And that's what we swore to protect.

39:39.160 --> 39:40.559
And...

39:40.640 --> 39:43.758
it's for the Kingdom.

39:43.840 --> 39:45.831
[Sighs]

39:48.360 --> 39:50.317
I hope we don't regret this.

39:52.320 --> 39:54.994
Yeah.

39:55.120 --> 39:56.633
Me too.

39:59.400 --> 40:04.679
[indistinct conversations]

40:37.400 --> 40:40.631
[Insects chirping]

40:40.720 --> 40:43.599
Henry: What? Where-- Wha--

40:43.680 --> 40:45.557
[Grunts]

41:01.280 --> 41:02.998
Alpha: Pick it up.

41:10.520 --> 41:14.309
Pick...it...up.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.514
Now...

41:23.600 --> 41:25.079
kill the boy.

41:28.360 --> 41:32.274
What?

41:32.360 --> 41:33.680
You weren't gone long.

41:33.800 --> 41:37.077
Maybe it was long enough.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.515
Long enough for what?

41:41.160 --> 41:43.993
To forget which side you're on.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.517
[Cries]

41:59.600 --> 42:02.399
Please...

42:02.480 --> 42:05.438
Don't be weak, like your father.

42:05.520 --> 42:09.354
You know what happened to him.

42:09.440 --> 42:13.149
Yeah, I know what happened
to him, Mother.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.712
Kill him.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.029
Or he'll kill you both.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.680
You decide.

42:21.760 --> 42:22.750
Go on.

42:22.840 --> 42:23.955
[Walkers growling in distance]

42:24.040 --> 42:25.360
Lookout Whisperer: Guardians!

[Walkers growling]

43:01.840 --> 43:03.797
Lydia, we need to go.

43:06.440 --> 43:09.478
Keep your head down. We're leaving.

43:09.560 --> 43:10.834
Not without Lydia.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.752
No, the girl stays.

43:12.840 --> 43:13.989
Then so do I.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.279
Henry...

43:18.360 --> 43:20.237
No.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.277
I'm not leaving you.

43:22.360 --> 43:23.680
I won't.

43:23.760 --> 43:26.593
[Cries softly]

43:28.720 --> 43:31.075
- Now.
- Come on!
