WEBVTT

00:17.851 --> 00:20.287
Hey, that's my Barbie!

00:33.233 --> 00:33.934
Can I try?

00:38.805 --> 00:39.940
F***.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.811
-Oh, f***. Oh, yo!
-Sorry.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.574
-Hey! We almost died.
-That's my fault.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.776
-My fault we almost died.
-But the bouncing was more important.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.611
-Yeah. That was good.
-We said, "Oh, s***..."

02:57.678 --> 02:59.713
Yeah, that made it a real...

02:59.780 --> 03:01.782
-I like that we didn't skip a beat.
-No.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.951
That is what comes
from being a theater person.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.252
-Yes.
-You stay in it.

03:05.319 --> 03:07.888
This too, it comes from
being a theater person.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.791
That too is what you come
from being a theater person.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.125
You sounded like Judy Garland.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.360
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.329
You come from the theater,
don't you?

03:15.395 --> 03:17.965
- I sure do.
- You were on Broadway.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.167
-You were in Rent. You were in...
-No.

03:20.234 --> 03:22.536
-Right? You were in The Lion King.
-No.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.505
I was in the original
Broadway cast of Cats.

03:24.571 --> 03:27.875
-Really? That's a long time ago.
-I look really good for my age.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.377
-Um, no, I wasn't.
-That's a long time ago.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.380
-I did Broadway when I was younger.
-Yeah.

03:33.447 --> 03:36.283
-I was a huge theater nerd my whole life.
-Yeah.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.684
-Still am.
-Yup. Nice.

03:37.751 --> 03:41.855
It's what I put on when I need
to restore my soul and heal myself.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.390
-It's very earnest music.
-Yeah.

03:43.457 --> 03:46.793
It brings you back to home.
Do you know what I mean?

03:46.860 --> 03:49.396
It does. It does.
I was raised on that stuff.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.431
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.137
I've never been happier.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.144
What's your favorite musical?

06:17.211 --> 06:20.848
-One of my dream roles is to play Elphaba.
-Now, why have you not done that?

06:20.914 --> 06:22.749
I would think that
they would be clamoring.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.352
-You don't have the time, obviously.
-No. I would do it tomorrow.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.588
I'd cancel my whole s***.

06:27.654 --> 06:31.058
- To do Elphaba in Wicked?
- Like, yeah. That's my dream.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.634
-That's me.
-F***.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.103
That's me.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.838
-Oh, what did you just say?
-Huh?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.207
-What did you say?
-Me?

07:53.273 --> 07:54.741
-Yes.
-Did I f*** it up?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.844
-You said "Christ."
-I think...

07:57.845 --> 08:00.347
-Biker. Careful. Sorry.
-Hey, watch out.

08:00.414 --> 08:03.016
We're singing show tunes, buddy.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.251
Ahh!

08:43.724 --> 08:44.758
F***!

08:45.626 --> 08:47.060
-It was great.
-Yeah.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.697
Do you wanna hear something
so embarrassing?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.766
-Sure.
-I used to wait outside

08:52.833 --> 08:57.204
the Jersey Boys theater
in line every f****** day.

08:57.271 --> 08:59.873
-Was this before you were Ariana Grande?
-Yeah.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.143
I mean, I was still Ariana Grande,
just younger.

09:03.210 --> 09:07.848
You couldn't concoct a stage name
that's better than...

09:07.915 --> 09:09.516
-That's like a...
-Oh, thanks, man.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.352
"Ariana Grande," like if a publicist
came up with a name,

09:12.419 --> 09:14.521
-it wouldn't be better than that.
-Thank you, man.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.657
-Like Seth MacFarlane. I sound like...
-I love yours.

09:16.723 --> 09:19.026
I sound like...
it's like I'm a Scottish Jew.

09:19.026 --> 09:22.429
I sound like a drink
or a member of the Mafia.

09:22.496 --> 09:25.599
That would be a good segue to Starbucks
if we were anywhere near one.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.401
-Ooh!
-What's that rattling?

09:27.467 --> 09:29.303
I could use another 10.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.449
What do you want?

09:42.516 --> 09:44.651
-Wow.
-What the hell happened here?

09:46.587 --> 09:50.057
-What is this window?
-Hey. Hang on.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.359
Your menu looks like
it was hit with a boulder.

09:52.426 --> 09:53.660
Uh, let me see.

09:54.461 --> 09:58.165
May I please have a Grande
Iced Black Coffee, no sweetener?

09:58.232 --> 09:59.233
10.40. Thank you.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.869
-Thank you.
-What the f*** happened to their screen?

10:04.071 --> 10:05.138
-Hello.
-Hi. Sorry.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.740
Hello.

10:07.741 --> 10:08.742
What's that?

10:09.710 --> 10:11.311
If you want.

10:14.481 --> 10:15.816
Here. You sing, I'll play.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.592
Thank you!

10:30.097 --> 10:33.734
Thank you for the coffee.
That's our song.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.870
Bring a little f******* joy
into somebody's life?

10:38.705 --> 10:41.408
-Did we get our coffees?
-Oh, no. We didn't get our coffee.

11:07.668 --> 11:08.669
Oh, you do this.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.913
The room had no windows or floors

11:20.914 --> 11:21.915
No windows?

11:21.982 --> 11:23.717
-What? I'm acting.
-Oh, yeah.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.752
-Is that okay? I'm committed.
-Oh, yeah.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.855
-Oh, f***, man.
-Sing.

11:57.718 --> 11:58.886
It's meadow rose.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.541
- That wasn't too bad.
-That was great.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.976
-Yeah. That worked out fine.
-I love singing with you.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.078
-I like your vibrato eyebrows.
-Yeah.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.147
-They wiggle.
-Sorry, was that a high-five?

12:27.214 --> 12:29.483
-I don't know what you just did.
-No. It was...

12:29.550 --> 12:31.084
I was pointing to your eyebrows.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.488
My life is a long history of missing
high-fives that were offered to me.

12:34.555 --> 12:36.623
Me too. Me too.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.459
- Genuinely, this was so much fun.
- I think we...

12:39.526 --> 12:41.228
got a lot accomplished.

12:41.295 --> 12:46.767
-And yet we have nothing in common.
-No. Nothing at all in common.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.472
You almost crashed the f****** car
