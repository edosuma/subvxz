MILITARY ADVISOR: Sir, there is news
from the battlefield.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.723
Avonlea has fallen.

00:22.607 --> 00:23.972
Oh, my gods!

00:25.401 --> 00:27.141
If only he had come.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.396
Well, he didn't, did he?

00:33.492 --> 00:35.483
Ogres are not men.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.118
GASTON: We have to do something.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.071
We have to stop them.

00:42.418 --> 00:44.249
They are unstoppable.

00:44.587 --> 00:46.669
He could be on his way
right now, Papa.

00:47.089 --> 00:51.332
It's too late, my girl.
It's just too late.

00:51.469 --> 00:53.084
(BANGING ON DOOR)

00:54.013 --> 00:55.878
lt's him! It has to be him.

00:55.973 --> 00:57.884
How could he get past the walls?

00:59.602 --> 01:01.138
Open it.

01:10.029 --> 01:12.520
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
Well, that was a bit of a letdown.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.442
You sent me a message.

01:18.621 --> 01:23.536
Something about, "Help, help!
We're dying. Can you save us?"

01:24.752 --> 01:26.458
Now, the answer is,

01:28.547 --> 01:30.083
yes,lcan.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.916
Yes, I can protect your little town

01:36.222 --> 01:37.211
for a price.

01:38.349 --> 01:39.839
We sent you a promise of gold.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.383
Ah!

01:41.477 --> 01:43.058
Now you see,

01:43.145 --> 01:46.273
I make gold.

01:47.358 --> 01:51.021
What I want is something
a bit more special.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.280
My price

01:54.657 --> 01:55.863
is her.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.365
No.

01:58.911 --> 02:02.574
The young lady is engaged to me.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.489
I wasn't asking if she was engaged.

02:05.710 --> 02:08.167
I'm not looking for love.

02:09.088 --> 02:11.249
I'm looking for a caretaker

02:11.340 --> 02:14.173
for my rather large estate.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.971
It's her or no deal.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.386
Get out.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.214
Leave!

02:23.602 --> 02:25.934
RUMPLESTILTSKIN: As you wish.

02:28.190 --> 02:29.771

No one decides my fate but me.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.117
I shall go.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.799
You have my word.

02:59.263 --> 03:00.298
Then you have mine.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.600
I will go with you forever.

03:04.018 --> 03:05.383
Deal! (GlGGLES)

03:07.897 --> 03:10.604
Belle, you cannot do this.

03:11.233 --> 03:16.227
Belle, please,
you can't go with this beast.

Father,

03:19.950 --> 03:20.939
Gaston,

03:22.828 --> 03:24.409
it's been decided.

03:26.916 --> 03:30.579
You know, she's right.

03:31.587 --> 03:34.329
The deal is struck.

03:38.094 --> 03:39.334
Oh.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.214
Congratulations on your little war.

03:51.941 --> 03:54.182
Well, this is just perfect.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.438
I've been looking for you,
Mr. French.

03:56.529 --> 03:57.860
I'll have your money next week.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.108
Terms of the loan
were fairly specific.

04:00.950 --> 04:01.939
Take the van.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.951
Wait! No!

04:07.915 --> 04:10.907

It's the biggest day of...

I'm gonna allow you two
to continue this conversation.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.635

04:42.158 --> 04:44.740
Mr. Gold.
Was quite a show back there.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.567
Well, Mr. French isjust
having a bad day.

04:46.662 --> 04:47.822
It happens to the best of us.

04:48.414 --> 04:50.075
I've been meaning to talk
to you about something...

04:50.166 --> 04:53.374
Yeah, and the moment you have
something I want to discuss,

04:53.461 --> 04:55.622
we'll have that little chat.

04:55.713 --> 04:58.375
No, we're gonna do this now.

04:58.466 --> 04:59.581
lt'll only take a moment.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.256
Is there something eating you, dear?

05:01.677 --> 05:04.589
Something you need
to get out in the open?

05:04.847 --> 05:06.929
Because it's gonna have to wait.

05:07.016 --> 05:08.256
Please.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.109
Oh, you got the book.

05:21.197 --> 05:23.233
Yeah. Yeah, just started it.

05:23.324 --> 05:26.191
It's great.
Can't wait to see how it ends.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.116
I can push the tables together
if you guys...

05:28.204 --> 05:30.365
-Oh, no, we're not together.
-No, no, it's...

05:35.419 --> 05:36.625

05:36.712 --> 05:40.796

So, how's your day going?

05:41.383 --> 05:42.919
Henry's fine.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.251
That's not what I asked you.

05:45.554 --> 05:46.669
You sure?

05:47.264 --> 05:49.550
Really. He's his normal self.

05:49.642 --> 05:51.724
Regina won't keep you
separated forever.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.722
When people are supposed
to be together, they find a way.

05:56.232 --> 05:57.312
EMMA: Yeah.

05:57.399 --> 06:01.062
So, he's his normal self.
He's fine, he's happy?

06:01.153 --> 06:02.233
Yes.

06:03.781 --> 06:04.987
No!

06:05.074 --> 06:07.816
He misses you. A lot.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.901
Trust me, I'm with him,
like, six hours a day.

06:10.246 --> 06:14.239
Six hours? You take newborns?
'Cause I would love six hours off.

It's, uh... It's, uh...

06:25.761 --> 06:26.967
I mean, the baby's great.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.511

06:29.598 --> 06:30.883

getting married thing.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.715

06:32.810 --> 06:35.142
and Sean's been working
double shifts at the cannery.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.344
Well, he has to work.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.895
On Valentine's Day? Yeah.

06:39.275 --> 06:40.515
He couldn't get out of it.

06:40.609 --> 06:41.849
I'm sorry, that sucks.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.434
It doesn't have to.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.269
Come out with me.
Let's have a girls' night.

the badge at home.

to look around, you know?

Was it yours

There was.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.013
There was a son.

13:37.109 --> 13:38.474
I lost him.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.810
As I did his mother.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.485
I'm sorry.

can't I at least know you?

Perhaps,

14:10.892 --> 14:13.634
perhaps you just want to learn
the monster's weaknesses.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.561
No,no,no.

all the mirrors up, isn't it?

14:26.366 --> 14:28.027
(BANGING ON DOOR)

14:30.537 --> 14:32.653
I am Sir Gaston.

14:32.748 --> 14:34.409
And you, Beast, have taken...

14:37.961 --> 14:39.246
Hmm.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.755
(DOORS OPEN)

14:43.467 --> 14:45.082
Who was that?

14:45.177 --> 14:47.589
Just an old woman selling flowers.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.302
(BELLE GASPS)

14:50.390 --> 14:51.345
Here.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.468
Huh.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.924

14:56.772 --> 14:57.761
Why, thank you.

14:59.483 --> 15:00.814
(CHUCKLES)

15:06.740 --> 15:08.526
You had a life, Belle,

15:09.451 --> 15:11.567
before this.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.786
Friends and family.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.575
What made you choose
to come here with me?

15:21.838 --> 15:23.089
Heroism.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.209
Sacrifice.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.254
You know,

15:28.345 --> 15:31.553
there aren't a lot of opportunities
for women in this land

15:31.640 --> 15:33.631
to show what they can do.

15:34.518 --> 15:36.304
To see the world, to be heroes.

15:38.313 --> 15:41.476
So when you arrived,
that was my chance.

15:42.818 --> 15:45.810
I always wanted to be brave.

15:46.071 --> 15:48.858
I figured, do the brave thing

15:50.742 --> 15:51.982
and bravery would follow.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.659
And is it everything you hoped?

15:54.955 --> 15:56.240
(LAUGHS)

15:57.874 --> 15:58.863
We||, uh...

16:00.585 --> 16:02.667
I did want to see the world.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.164
(CLEARS THROAT)

16:04.256 --> 16:06.463
That part didn't really work out.

16:06.842 --> 16:10.710
But, um... (SIGHS) I did save my village.

16:10.804 --> 16:15.343
And what about your, uh, betrothed?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.808
It was an arranged marriage.

16:19.187 --> 16:22.304
Honestly, I never really
cared much for Gaston.

16:24.526 --> 16:25.515
No.

16:25.986 --> 16:29.774
To me, love is layered.

16:30.991 --> 16:34.609
Love is a mystery to be uncovered.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.324
You know, I could
never truly give my heart

16:38.415 --> 16:40.371
to someone as superficial as he.

16:47.382 --> 16:51.125
But you were going
to tell me about your son.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.880
I'll tell you what.

16:54.222 --> 16:55.758
I'll make you a deal.

16:56.933 --> 17:00.721
Go to town and fetch me some straw.

17:02.230 --> 17:05.973
When you return, I'll share my tale.

17:06.735 --> 17:09.101
But, you...

17:09.571 --> 17:10.560
Town?

17:12.073 --> 17:13.688
You trust me to come back?

17:13.783 --> 17:15.034
Oh, no.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.947
I expect I'll never see you again.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.413
Mmm. Mmm!

17:22.792 --> 17:24.532
-Pace yourself, Ashley.
-Ooh!

17:24.628 --> 17:25.663
lam.

17:25.754 --> 17:27.665
This is the first night out
since I've had the baby.

17:27.756 --> 17:30.293
I am making up for lost time.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.251
RUBY: Mmm.
Ash, check out those guys.

17:35.764 --> 17:37.550
Honey, I'm still with Sean.

17:37.641 --> 17:39.802
You're not married.
And he's not here.

17:40.101 --> 17:41.261
He's working.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.593
He's always working.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.602
Have fun moping.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.686

17:50.153 --> 17:52.189
He is always working.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.779
(SIGHING) I thought love
would be different.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.240
Me, too.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.456
Two valentines?

18:09.631 --> 18:11.997
Sounds like a complicated life.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.378
Oh, no. I just couldn't decide.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.219
These are both for the same woman?

18:19.224 --> 18:22.341
Well, they're both so "us."

18:22.435 --> 18:24.050
I see.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.728
Well, you're fortunate you have
someone that loves you.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.479
I really am.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.849
GOLD: Love,

18:31.653 --> 18:33.735
it's like a delicate flame.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.945
And once it's gone,

18:36.491 --> 18:37.901
it's gone forever.

18:40.954 --> 18:41.909
Best of luck to you.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.203
Thanks.

18:43.832 --> 18:44.867

(COCKS GUN)

19:27.208 --> 19:29.119
You see, here's the thing.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.876
I don't normally let people get away.

-(HORSE NEIGHS)

19:55.904 --> 19:57.394
Did my carriage splash you?

19:58.114 --> 20:00.730
Oh, no. I'm fine.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.066
You know, I'm tired of riding.

20:03.578 --> 20:05.910
Let me stretch my legs
and walk with you for a spell.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.658
You carry very little.

20:11.753 --> 20:14.039
I don't want to be slowed down.

20:14.130 --> 20:17.338
Oh, you're running from someone.
(CHUCKLING)

20:17.759 --> 20:20.171
The question is, master or lover?

20:21.388 --> 20:22.673
Oh.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.846
Master and lover.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.801
I might take a rest.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.099
You go on ahead.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.930
So if I'm right,

20:34.943 --> 20:38.811
you love your employer,
but you're leaving him.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.533
I might love him.

20:42.617 --> 20:44.278
I mean, I could,

20:46.538 --> 20:49.655
except something evil
has taken root in him.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.741
It sounds like a curse to me.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.459
And all curses can be broken.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.832
A kiss born of true love would do it.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.425
(LAUGHING) Oh, child, no.

21:03.513 --> 21:08.177
I would never suggest a young woman
to kiss a man who held her captive.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.301
What kind of message is that?

21:12.105 --> 21:13.094
Right.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.352
Besides, if he loves you,
he would have let you go.

21:16.443 --> 21:20.607
And if he doesn't love you,
well, then the kiss won't even work.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.772
Well, he did let me go.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.903
Yes, but no kiss happened.

21:27.412 --> 21:30.404
And a kiss is enough?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.030
He would be a man again?

21:33.376 --> 21:34.912
An ordinary man.

21:37.172 --> 21:39.163
True Iove's kiss

21:39.841 --> 21:42.503
will break any curse.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.856
Oh, you're back already!

22:02.947 --> 22:05.233
Good. Good thing.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.692
I'm nearly out of straw.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.027
Hmm.

22:12.373 --> 22:15.615
Come on, you're happy that I'm back.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.081
-l'm not unhappy.
-(CHUCKLES)

22:23.009 --> 22:26.547
And you promised me a story.

22:26.763 --> 22:28.503
-Did I?
-Mmm-hmm.

22:33.978 --> 22:34.967
Oh.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.393
Tell me about your son.

22:40.902 --> 22:41.891
Uh...

22:42.737 --> 22:46.275
I lost him.
There's nothing more to tell, really.

22:48.243 --> 22:51.827
And since then, you've loved no one.

22:52.497 --> 22:54.488
And no one has loved you.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.916
Why did you come back?

23:02.757 --> 23:04.622
I wasn't going to.

23:08.846 --> 23:11.588
But then something changed my mind.

23:29.284 --> 23:31.491
What's happening?

23:31.953 --> 23:34.285
Kiss me again. It's working.

What is?

23:36.624 --> 23:39.206
Any curse can be broken.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.005

23:43.089 --> 23:44.078
Who knows that?

You evil soul.

23:56.561 --> 23:57.801
This was you!

23:57.895 --> 23:59.146
You turned her against me!

24:00.231 --> 24:02.267
You think you can make me weak?

24:02.358 --> 24:04.064
You think you can defeat me?

24:04.152 --> 24:05.892
Who are you talking to?

24:05.987 --> 24:08.194
The Queen! Your friend, the Queen.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.196
How did she get to you?

24:11.659 --> 24:12.819
The Queen? I don't...

24:12.910 --> 24:15.322
I knew this was a trick.

24:15.413 --> 24:17.654
I knew you could never care for me.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.498
Oh, yeah. You're working for her.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.292

and killing the beast?

-Shut up!

tell me where it is.

who told you to take it.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.395
"Kathryn, l woof you."

29:34.482 --> 29:35.642
No.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.516
So sorry,

29:42.365 --> 29:44.196
I meant this one.

29:49.330 --> 29:52.072
I always thought that if two people
were supposed to be together,

29:52.166 --> 29:53.372
they would find a way.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.996
But, David, if this is our way,

29:56.087 --> 29:58.624
I think we should find another one.

29:59.507 --> 30:00.496
Mary Margaret...

30:00.591 --> 30:03.583
I think you should
go home to Kathryn.

30:05.012 --> 30:06.422
I know.

30:08.516 --> 30:10.006
You're right.

30:10.935 --> 30:13.426
It doesn't mean I'm gonna give up.

30:13.521 --> 30:15.728
We'll find that way.

30:15.815 --> 30:17.146
I hope so.

30:21.696 --> 30:23.311
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-(CHUCKLES)

30:24.031 --> 30:25.862
Happy Valentine's Day.

30:36.877 --> 30:40.495
So, I heard you managed
not to break anything he needs.

30:40.589 --> 30:41.965
You're lucky, Mr. Gold.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.836
You got a funny definition of lucky.

30:45.761 --> 30:47.968
You have a funny definition
ofjustice.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.421
What did he really do?

30:51.684 --> 30:52.890
He stole.

30:53.227 --> 30:56.094
That reaction was about
more than taking a few trinkets.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.972
You said something about
how he hurt her,

30:59.066 --> 31:00.647
what happened to her?

31:00.735 --> 31:02.396
Who was that? What did he do?

31:02.486 --> 31:04.317
If someone needs help,
maybe I can help.

31:04.405 --> 31:07.772
No. I'm sorry, Sheriff,
I think you heard that wrong.

31:08.284 --> 31:09.740
You really don't want to cooperate.

31:09.827 --> 31:12.068
Look, we're done here.

31:12.163 --> 31:15.121
Actually, we're not.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.656
You're under arrest.

31:30.264 --> 31:31.253
(DOOR OPENS)

31:39.273 --> 31:41.013
So, what are you going to do to me?

31:42.818 --> 31:43.978
Go.

31:47.740 --> 31:48.820
”Go”?

31:50.493 --> 31:52.859
I don't want you anymore, dearie.

32:11.806 --> 32:14.388
You know, you were freeing yourself.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.216
You could've had happiness

32:16.310 --> 32:19.393
if you just believed
that someone could want you.

32:25.194 --> 32:26.855
That's a lie.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.655
You are a coward, Rumplestiltskin.

32:33.327 --> 32:36.239
And no matter how thick
you make your skin,

32:36.330 --> 32:38.241
that doesn't change.

32:38.332 --> 32:40.744
I'm not a coward, dearie.

32:40.835 --> 32:43.076
It's quite simple, really.

32:43.170 --> 32:48.164
My power means more to me than you.

32:50.886 --> 32:51.921
No.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.130
No, it doesn't.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.560
You just don't think I can love you.

33:01.397 --> 33:03.934
Now you've made your choice.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.854
And you're going to regret it.

33:09.321 --> 33:10.822
Forever.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.731
And all you'll have

33:14.368 --> 33:16.199
is an empty heart

33:18.873 --> 33:21.205
and a chipped cup.

33:36.974 --> 33:39.841
Pastrami. You want half?

33:41.312 --> 33:43.473
You know, I still owe you that favor.

33:43.564 --> 33:47.603
Nice, fatty pastrami,
delicious way to clear the books.

33:47.693 --> 33:51.311
I don't need a reminder
that you owe me a favor.

33:52.656 --> 33:55.489
And when the day comes
that I make my request,

33:55.576 --> 33:57.362
it'll be for more than
half a sandwich.

30 minutes with Henry.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.462

34:08.589 --> 34:11.626
You want me to leave you alone

Hey.

Bring me back a cone.

Just this once.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.146
Come on, let's go.

34:29.693 --> 34:33.777
Well, you really wanted
that little chat, didn't you?

34:33.864 --> 34:36.947
Apparently, this is the only way
I could do it.

34:38.035 --> 34:40.276
Please, sit.

34:47.962 --> 34:50.544
Now, when two people
both want something the other has,

34:50.631 --> 34:52.713
a deal can always be struck.

34:53.801 --> 34:55.462
Do you have what I want?

34:58.055 --> 34:59.044
Yes.

35:06.272 --> 35:07.808
So, you did put him up to it, then.

35:09.066 --> 35:14.026
l merely suggested that strong men
take what they need.

35:14.113 --> 35:17.822
Oh, yeah, and you told him just
exactly what to take, didn't you?

35:17.908 --> 35:20.741
We used to know each other
so well, Mr. Gold.

35:20.828 --> 35:22.318
Has it really come down to this?

35:22.413 --> 35:24.825
It seems it has, yeah.

35:24.915 --> 35:26.826
But you know what I want.

35:27.751 --> 35:29.366
What is it you want?

35:29.461 --> 35:33.500
I want you to answer one question.

35:34.216 --> 35:36.127
And answer it simply.

35:36.677 --> 35:37.666
What's your name?

35:40.180 --> 35:42.171
It's Mr. Gold.

35:44.059 --> 35:45.344
Your real name.

35:45.436 --> 35:48.849
Every moment I've spent
on this Earth, that's been my name.

35:49.690 --> 35:52.397
But what about
moments spent elsewhere?

35:58.866 --> 36:00.527
What are you asking me?

36:00.617 --> 36:02.573
I think you know.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.528
If you want me
to return what's yours,

36:05.622 --> 36:09.114

36:27.519 --> 36:28.508
Oh, yeah.

36:33.442 --> 36:34.932

how things used to be, shall we?

37:02.930 --> 37:05.091
And don't let these bars
fool you, dear.

37:05.766 --> 37:07.757
I'm the one with
the power around here.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.217
I'm gonna be out of here in no time.

What is it this time?

more powerful than me.

Right.

Well, you can rest assured I had
nothing to do with that tragedy.

What tragedy?

38:56.335 --> 38:57.541
You don't know?

no one would want her, of course.

with scourges and flaying.
