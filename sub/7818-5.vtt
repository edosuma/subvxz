22:15.709 --> 22:17.711
THAT'S IT!

22:17.794 --> 22:19.087
BECAUSE BY
BLOWING UP THE WEASEL,

22:19.171 --> 22:20.756
IT'LL SET OFF THE ALARM,

22:20.839 --> 22:21.590
WHICH WILL TRIGGER
THE SPRINKLERS

22:21.673 --> 22:22.966
AND CAUSE SWEENEY
TO POSTPONE THE TEST,

22:23.050 --> 22:24.801
GIVING ME MORE TIME
TO STUDY.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.804
GORDY, YOU'RE THE BEST.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.769
ADIOS, VAMPIRE WEASEL!

22:33.852 --> 22:37.522
BY THE WAY, HOW MUCH
DYNAMITE DID YOU USE?

22:43.236 --> 22:44.529
APPARENTLY TOO MUCH.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.786
{\an4}WELL, THIS STORY
IS WRAPPING UP
QUITE NICELY.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.704
AND NOW THAT
I'M A GHOST,

22:52.788 --> 22:54.790
I DON'T HAVE TO
TAKE THE B.A.T.s.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.124
{\an1}AND I CAN STOP HANGING
OUT WITH QWERLY

22:56.208 --> 22:56.750
{\an1}AND HANG OUT
WITH YOU GUYS...

22:56.833 --> 22:58.794
LIKE BEFORE.

22:58.877 --> 23:01.755
AND I GOT RID OF THAT
PESKY VAMPIRE WEASEL.

23:01.838 --> 23:05.509
{\an4}WOW. I GUESS TNT
REALLY DOES SOLVE
EVERYTHING.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.303
MR. BIGBY...

23:08.386 --> 23:11.139
{\an5}I'LL EXPECT YOU
IN GHOST CLASS
TOMORROW.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.767
I'M GIVING
THE W.T.W.T.s--

23:13.850 --> 23:16.603
WALKING THROUGH
WALLS TEST.

23:18.730 --> 23:20.941
NOOOO!

23:25.529 --> 23:26.822
AND ONE LAST TIP...
