WEBVTT

00:00.234 --> 00:04.103
<i> PREVIOUSLY</i>
<i> ON</i> PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:04.105 --> 00:06.405
NOEL KAHN IS "A."

00:06.407 --> 00:08.073
NOEL.

00:08.075 --> 00:11.443
"I SEE YOU." IT MEANS
SOMEBODY SAW US LAST NIGHT.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.945
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.116
THE BANK LOAN CAME THROUGH.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.317
IN A LASAGNA BOX?

00:18.319 --> 00:20.552
IT IS A LOAN.
UNAUTHORIZED.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.021
I'M GAY.

00:22.023 --> 00:25.424
THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.127
SHE IS STRUGGLING WITH THIS.
I CAN SEE IT.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.062
<i> I KNOW YOU WANT TO KISS ME.</i>

00:30.064 --> 00:33.232
IS THERE, UH,
ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME
ABOUT WHAT YOU SEE?

00:33.234 --> 00:35.534
I THINK SHE'S TALKING
TO THE OLDER BOY.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.936
SO-CALLED, UH,
MYSTERY BOYFRIEND?

00:37.938 --> 00:39.538
"ALISON LOVES IAN"?

00:41.208 --> 00:43.609
WE'RE MARRIED.
( both laugh )

00:43.611 --> 00:45.277
YOU'RE WHAT?

00:45.279 --> 00:47.646
ISN'T HILTON HEAD
IN SOUTH CAROLINA?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.114
I THOUGHT YOUR GRANDMA
LIVED IN GEORGIA.

00:49.116 --> 00:50.482
IT'S STILL THE SOUTH, SPENCE.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.051
WHY SO MANY QUESTIONS?

00:52.053 --> 00:53.352
HE'S GOT A LOT OF STUFF, IAN.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.920
( chuckles softly )

00:54.922 --> 00:57.923
YEAH. SUDDENLY HE'S,
UH, EVERYWHERE.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.463
( indistinct whispers )

01:22.850 --> 01:25.150
( indistinct whispers )

01:30.124 --> 01:32.691
( indistinct whispers )

01:37.598 --> 01:39.398
( stair creaks )

01:40.901 --> 01:41.633
IS SOMEONE THERE?

01:45.339 --> 01:47.005
MELISSA, NO ONE
COULD HAVE HEARD US.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.356
( computer beeping )

02:24.945 --> 02:26.178
The Pierces:
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET ¶</i>

02:26.180 --> 02:27.346
<i> ¶ CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

02:27.348 --> 02:29.748
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

02:29.750 --> 02:32.050
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

02:32.052 --> 02:34.686
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

02:34.688 --> 02:36.922
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

02:36.924 --> 02:39.525
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

02:39.527 --> 02:41.960
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

02:41.962 --> 02:44.129
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

03:07.955 --> 03:11.456
'MORNING.

03:11.458 --> 03:13.325
YOU OKAY? YOU SEEM
A LITTLE JUMPY.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.661
YEAH. YOU SURPRISED ME,
THAT'S ALL.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.529
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE BACK.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.731
YEAH, WE DIDN'T--
WE DIDN'T WAKE YOU LAST NIGHT?

03:19.733 --> 03:21.500
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T HEAR US?

03:21.502 --> 03:23.535
NO. LIKE I SAID,
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE BACK.

03:27.308 --> 03:30.108
SO, IS THIS ALL
GOING IN THE BARN?

03:30.110 --> 03:32.544
HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR SISTER'S WARDROBE?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.279
NO, THE MOVERS ARE
COMING ON FRIDAY.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.348
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE IT
TO OUR PLACE IN PHILLY.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.516
OH.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.457
LISTEN, SPENCE, UM...

03:45.459 --> 03:47.960
I KNOW OUR DECISION
TO GET MARRIED WAS SUDDEN,

03:47.962 --> 03:50.495
AND... YEAH, I GET
THAT IT'S THROWN YOU,

03:50.497 --> 03:53.599
BUT... YOU KNOW,
WE'RE FAMILY NOW.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.100
I HOPE YOU START
THINKING OF ME LIKE THAT.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.839
SO, HOW WAS THE HONEYMOON?

04:00.841 --> 04:03.609
OH, IT'S PERFECT.

04:03.611 --> 04:06.812
NO GOLF FOR THE NEWLYWEDS?

04:06.814 --> 04:09.081
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE SPENT
MOST OF OUR TIME INDOORS.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.787
H-HAVE YOU EVER
PLAYED HERE?

04:17.391 --> 04:19.391
WHAT, HILTON HEAD?
YEAH.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.927
ALISON WENT
TO A TOURNAMENT THERE
WITH HER GRANDMOTHER.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.096
REALLY?

04:24.098 --> 04:27.532
UH-HUH. SHE DISAPPEARED
THE NIGHT SHE GOT HOME.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.705
IS IT A NICE COURSE?

04:33.707 --> 04:36.375
UH, YEAH,
FROM WHAT I REMEMBER,

04:36.377 --> 04:38.143
BUT IT WAS YEARS AGO.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.080
( sizzling )

04:49.390 --> 04:50.489
'MORNING.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.691
AH. GOOD MORNING.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.060
OKAY, GO AHEAD,
YOU CAN SAY IT OUT LOUD--

04:55.062 --> 04:57.062
"DAD HAS GOTTEN THE HANG
OF THIS SINGLE PARENT THING."

04:57.064 --> 04:58.497
IT LOOKS GOOD.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.898
YEAH.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.069
DID YOU SEE MOM
LAST NIGHT?

05:04.071 --> 05:06.738
UM... YES, I DID.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.774
HOW'D IT GO?

05:08.776 --> 05:10.676
WELL...

05:10.678 --> 05:13.045
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING
TO BE A DATE WITH YOUR MOM

05:13.047 --> 05:16.648
TURNED INTO YOUR MOM
TELLING ME THAT SHE'S
DATING... OTHER PEOPLE.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.649
WHAT?

05:21.188 --> 05:22.988
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.490
IT'S NOT REALLY MY PLACE
TO TELL HER THAT SHE CAN'T.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.160
THAT'S JUST SO YOU, DAD.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.628
YOU LIE AND CHEAT,

05:29.630 --> 05:32.898
BUT YOU DRAW THE LINE
AT HYPOCRISY.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.199
YOU'RE SUCH A ROLE MODEL.
MIKE!

05:39.807 --> 05:41.073
( door slams )

05:43.243 --> 05:45.777
( Southern accent )
HI. I'M PLANNIN'
A SURPRISE VISIT

05:45.779 --> 05:48.113
FOR MY HUSBAND, AND HE
CANNOT STOP TALKIN'

05:48.115 --> 05:50.615
ABOUT THE ROOM HE HAD
ON HIS LAST VISIT.

05:50.617 --> 05:54.353
CAN YOU PULL UP
THAT RESERVATION?

05:54.355 --> 05:56.655
HIS NAME IS IAN THOMAS.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.824
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

05:58.826 --> 06:01.626
I THINK IAN AND ALISON
WERE TOGETHER

06:01.628 --> 06:04.062
THE WEEKEND BEFORE
SHE DISAPPEARED.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.797
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW ALISON WAS ACTING

06:05.799 --> 06:08.133
WHEN SHE GOT HOME FROM
VISITING HER GRANDMOTHER?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.901
ALL GIGGLES AND TAN?

06:09.903 --> 06:11.403
YEAH.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.572
ALIE HATED OLD PEOPLE,

06:13.574 --> 06:15.540
AND ALIE'S GRANDMOTHER
LIVES IN GEORGIA.

06:15.542 --> 06:18.210
HILTON HEAD
IS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
SHE WAS LYING TO US.

06:18.212 --> 06:19.478
SO WHAT?

06:19.480 --> 06:21.146
ALISON LIED
MORE THAN SHE BREATHED.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.448
YOU THINK THAT WAS ENOUGH
TO MAKE IAN WANT TO

06:23.450 --> 06:25.250
PERMANENTLY SHUT HER UP?

06:25.252 --> 06:28.620
WOW. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
HAPPY TO HEAR IT WAS
ANYBODY BUT TOBY.

06:28.622 --> 06:32.824
ALL TOBY WANTED
WAS FOR ME TO BELIEVE HIM,

06:32.826 --> 06:34.459
AND I DIDN'T.

06:34.461 --> 06:37.929
TOBY LIED ABOUT
A LOT OF THINGS TOO, EM.

06:37.931 --> 06:42.267
IF LYING WAS A CRIME,
WE WOULD ALL BE IN JAIL.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.302
AGENT COOPER.
GOOD MORNING.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.370
HI.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.605
BEAUTIFUL DAY, HUH?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.247
THANKS FOR DRIVING ME.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.450
HANNA, I'M YOUR MOTHER.
SINCE WHEN DO YOU THANK ME
FOR TAKING YOU ANYWHERE?

06:58.452 --> 07:02.120
I FEEL GUILTY, OKAY?

07:02.122 --> 07:04.423
AND I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT THE MONEY.

07:04.425 --> 07:05.924
I'D FEEL BETTER
IF YOU'D YELL AT ME.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.526
( mirthless chuckle )

07:07.528 --> 07:09.361
WELL, IF I THOUGHT IT
WOULD BRING BACK THE CASH.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.532
SO, ARE WE
TOTALLY BROKE AGAIN?

07:13.534 --> 07:15.967
NOT TOTALLY. NO.

07:15.969 --> 07:18.970
THANK YOU, GOD,
I ALREADY USED
SOME OF THE MONEY

07:18.972 --> 07:21.373
TO GET US OUT OF DEBT.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.876
THE PLAN WAS
TO INVEST THE REST

07:24.878 --> 07:26.945
SO I COULD REPLACE IT ALL

07:26.947 --> 07:28.880
BEFORE ANYONE
REALIZED IT WAS GONE.

07:28.882 --> 07:31.883
WELL, IF THE BANK FINDS OUT
ABOUT YOUR UNAUTHORIZED LOAN,

07:31.885 --> 07:34.219
THAT'S... IT'S LIKE
A FELONY, RIGHT?

07:34.221 --> 07:36.121
IT'S ONLY A FELONY
IF THEY FIND OUT.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.832
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE TRADED IN
HER WHEELS FOR HEELS.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.801
THEY'RE FLATS,
BUT THEY ARE FERRAGAMOS.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.636
THANK YOU.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.072
Agent Cooper:
THE FOOD IN THIS
TOWN IS TO DIE FOR.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.408
I'M MISSING IT ALREADY.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.009
ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

07:58.011 --> 08:00.278
CAME HERE TO FIND THE PERSON
THAT KILLED YOUR FRIEND.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.347
TOBY CAVANAUGH
MAY BE OUT ON BAIL,

08:02.349 --> 08:04.916
BUT HE'S NOT LEAVING TOWN,
AND WE HAVE A SOLID CASE
AGAINST HIM.

08:04.918 --> 08:08.453
SO, UNLESS YOU HAVE
A REASON FOR ME TO STAY...

08:08.455 --> 08:10.722
WELL, I GUESS WE'LL
SEE YOU AROUND, THEN.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.624
YOU GIRLS TAKE CARE.

08:14.394 --> 08:15.460
BYE.

08:16.730 --> 08:17.929
What?

08:17.931 --> 08:19.564
Ian was definitely
at Hilton Head

08:19.566 --> 08:21.867
the same weekend Alie was.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.870
Maybe we<i> do</i> have a reason
for Cooper to stay.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.740
AGENT COOPER IS NOT
SOME SMALL-TOWN COP

08:28.742 --> 08:30.742
THAT'S GOING TO ARREST
SPENCER'S BROTHER-IN-LAW

08:30.744 --> 08:32.744
BECAUSE ALIE CARVED
HIS NAME INTO A TREE.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.113
YEAH, A TREE
THAT'S NO LONGER THERE.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.649
NO ONE KNOWS THAT BUT US.
AND IAN.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.017
AND "A."

08:42.222 --> 08:44.055
( inaudible )

08:44.057 --> 08:46.758
NOEL LED US TO THAT TREE
FOR A REASON.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.927
IS "A"...

08:48.929 --> 08:51.930
I MEAN, IS NOEL
TRYING TO HELP US FIND
ALIE'S KILLER?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.732
"A" HELPING US?

08:53.734 --> 08:55.066
WOW, THAT'S A FIRST.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.202
HOW COULD NOEL EVEN KNOW
ABOUT IAN AND ALIE?

08:57.204 --> 08:59.704
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
HOW NOEL IS ALWAYS AROUND?

09:06.179 --> 09:07.746
ARE THEY FRIENDS?

09:10.117 --> 09:11.182
NO.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.421
HANNA'S RIGHT
ABOUT COOPER.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.189
WE NEED TO FIND
SOME KIND OF PROOF.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.691
THANK YOU,
VERONICA MARS.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.929
THAT PROOF MAY BE
BOXED IN YOUR KITCHEN.

09:23.931 --> 09:24.763
HI.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.032
HEY.

09:29.803 --> 09:30.936
ARE WE STILL ON
TILL LATER?

09:32.306 --> 09:33.838
YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT YOUR DAD'S GONE?

09:33.840 --> 09:36.374
YEAH, MY DAD KNOWS
HOW MY DAD FEELS
ABOUT US.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.144
IN OTHER WORDS,
HE'LL TOLERATE ME.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.146
SHE'S SPENDING THE DAY
IN THE CITY,

09:41.148 --> 09:43.348
SO YOU'LL BE SAFE,
I PROMISE.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.683
WHAT'S LATER?

09:44.685 --> 09:45.951
UM, STUDYING.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.987
IS THAT GIRL-ON-GIRL CODE
FOR ROMANCE?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.489
NO, HANNA,
WE'RE ACTUALLY STUDYING.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.491
BUT YOUR FRIEND
IS A ROMANTIC.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.659
IS SHE?

09:54.661 --> 09:56.628
OH, YEAH. UM...
WALKS IN THE RAIN,

09:56.630 --> 10:00.799
PICNICS BY THE LAKE,
DANCING NAKED IN CANDLELIGHT.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.438
( laughing )
I'M JUST KIDDING.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.840
WE GO TO DINNER AND A MOVIE,
JUST LIKE YOU GUYS.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.376
WELL, SHE'S NOT
ENTIRELY KIDDING.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.445
EMILY WOULD LOVE TO DO
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.614
OKAY, YOU'VE SHARED ENOUGH.

10:40.707 --> 10:42.340
NICE VEST.

10:42.342 --> 10:44.175
THIS IS YOUR
TEACHER LOOK, RIGHT?

10:44.177 --> 10:48.179
I'M AN OBSERVANT GUY.
I SEE THINGS OTHER PEOPLE
MAY NOT NOTICE.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.714
YOUR POINT IS?

10:49.716 --> 10:52.484
ARIA TOLD ME THAT YOU
MIGHT HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD

10:52.486 --> 10:57.656
OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION,
ABOUT MY DISAPPOINTING GRADE.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.024
IT'S SWEET HOW CLOSE
YOU TWO ARE.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.325
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:00.327 --> 11:02.227
I WANT TO MAKE THIS
EASY FOR YOU.

11:02.229 --> 11:04.095
THIS IS A BRAND-NEW PAPER,

11:04.097 --> 11:06.031
AND, TRUST ME,
IT'S WORTHY OF AN "A."

11:08.368 --> 11:11.970
YEAH, THIS IS THE SAME ESSAY.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.972
YOU JUST REPRINTED IT.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.742
WELL, LAST TIME WE TALKED,
I WANTED THE "A."

11:17.744 --> 11:19.244
THIS TIME I NEED IT,

11:19.246 --> 11:21.212
OR I DON'T GET TO SUIT UP
FOR FRIDAY'S GAME.

11:23.684 --> 11:26.685
IT'S A FEW STROKES OF A PEN.
WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR YOU?

11:26.687 --> 11:28.153
IF YOU HAVE
TO ASK THE QUESTION,

11:28.155 --> 11:29.754
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND
MY ANSWER.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.656
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, KAHN?

11:33.460 --> 11:35.427
I WAS LOOKING FOR
ARIA MONTGOMERY.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.995
SHE'S GOT
FIRST PERIOD HERE, RIGHT?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.930
SO, ARE YOU TWO
STILL HOOKING UP?

11:38.932 --> 11:42.534
THE THING ABOUT ARIA IS,
SHE'S WAY INTO OLDER GUYS.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.736
GIVE ME THE PAPER.
I CAN REREAD IT TODAY.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.840
I KNEW YOU'D DO
THE RIGHT THING.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.227
Aria: HEY.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.895
HEY!

12:12.866 --> 12:15.200
DO YOU WANT TO GRAB
A COFFEE AFTER SCHOOL?

12:15.202 --> 12:16.568
I COULD USE A STUDY BUDDY.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.470
I WOULD, BUT I HAVE
PHYSICAL THERAPY.

12:18.472 --> 12:21.873
HEY, I JUST HEARD
THAT TOBY'S HERE.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.743
WOULD THEY LET HIM
COME BACK TO SCHOOL?

12:24.745 --> 12:26.244
Boy: HEY, FREAK
COMING THROUGH!

12:26.246 --> 12:30.115
Man: BACK OFF.
GET TO CLASS.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.649
STEP BACK.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.272
MURDERER.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.807
STEP ASIDE, PLEASE.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.378
LET'S GO.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.186
( chuckling )

13:54.367 --> 13:56.701
<i> ¶ WE WERE GONNA DRIVE</i>
<i> ACROSS THE COUNTRY ¶</i>

14:00.473 --> 14:02.807
<i> ¶ LIVE IN SPAIN ¶</i>

14:02.809 --> 14:04.442
<i> ¶ OR ITALY ¶</i>

14:06.479 --> 14:08.313
<i> ¶ WE WERE GONNA CLIMB... ¶</i>

14:08.315 --> 14:09.914
OINK-OINK.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.217
<i> ¶ TO THE TOP</i>
<i> OF THE EIFFEL TOWER ¶</i>

14:12.219 --> 14:14.485
<i> ¶ STAY UP ALL NIGHT ¶</i>

14:14.487 --> 14:18.456
<i> ¶ FOR THE METEOR SHOWER ¶</i>

14:18.458 --> 14:22.126
<i> ¶ BUT WE ARE</i>
<i> STILL YOUNG ENOUGH ¶</i>

14:25.198 --> 14:29.234
<i> ¶ AND WE'VE STILL GOT TIME ¶</i>

14:29.236 --> 14:31.236
( doorbell rings )

14:31.238 --> 14:34.906
<i> ¶ IT'S NOT TOO LATE ¶</i>

14:37.544 --> 14:40.511
<i> ¶ IT'S NOT TOO LATE ¶</i>

14:45.719 --> 14:47.051
I UNDERSTAND.

14:55.629 --> 14:56.794
POOR HANNA.

14:56.796 --> 14:59.130
<i> ¶ AND SWIM WITH SHARKS ¶</i>

15:02.002 --> 15:04.202
<i> ¶ MEMORIZE THE PATTERN ¶</i>

15:04.204 --> 15:08.373
<i> ¶ OF THE STARS ¶</i>
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FEEL THIS WAY.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.275
I CAN SHOW YOU
HOW TO GET RID OF IT.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.876
<i> ¶ WE WERE GONNA</i>
<i> FALL IN LOVE ¶</i>

15:13.780 --> 15:16.581
<i> ¶ REALIZE SOMETIMES ¶</i>

15:16.583 --> 15:18.883
<i> ¶ IT'S NOT ENOUGH ¶</i>

15:20.620 --> 15:23.554
<i> ¶ WE ARE</i>
<i> STILL YOUNG ENOUGH ¶</i>

15:26.593 --> 15:29.827
<i> ¶ WE'VE STILL GOT TIME ¶</i>

15:29.829 --> 15:31.362
( laughter )

15:34.100 --> 15:37.435
DO YOU LIKE THAT?
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.737
( laughter continues )

15:42.943 --> 15:44.309
EMILY!

15:44.311 --> 15:46.778
MOM! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:46.780 --> 15:49.080
I WON'T LIVE LIKE THIS.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.582
LIKE WHAT?
I-I THOUGHT YOU
WERE GONNA BE OUT.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.484
AND THAT GIVES
YOU PERMISSION...?

15:53.486 --> 15:56.821
I-I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
WHERE THIS WAS HEADED.

15:56.823 --> 16:00.425
PAM, I PROMISE
WE WERE STUDYING.
THAT'S ALL.

16:02.362 --> 16:07.532
MRS. FIELDS.
I AM MRS. FIELDS TO YOU.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.133
I THINK I SHOULD GO.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.303
I'M SO SORRY, MAYA.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.873
IT'S OKAY. YOU DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.852
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE,

16:27.854 --> 16:29.854
I AM ASHAMED
THAT YOU'RE MY MOTHER.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.180
HANNA?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.351
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

17:00.353 --> 17:02.653
Boy: OINK-OINK.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.989
DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE PRACTICE,
OR DID YOU LOSE YOUR BALLS?

17:09.629 --> 17:13.197
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
PHYSICAL THERAPY.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.732
I LIED.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.001
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT?

17:17.003 --> 17:19.103
( chuckles )
I WISH I COULD.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.780
I REALLY HATE "A."

17:32.652 --> 17:37.088
HE HAS SOMETHING ON MY MOM
THAT CAN GET HER INTO
A LOT OF TROUBLE.

17:37.090 --> 17:38.389
WHAT DOES HE WANT YOU TO DO?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.091
REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO EAT

17:40.093 --> 17:42.093
WHEN I GOT NERVOUS
OR FELT BAD?

17:42.095 --> 17:43.828
ALISON...

17:43.830 --> 17:47.965
WALKED IN ON ME
AFTER A BINGE, AND...

17:47.967 --> 17:49.767
SHE WAS ACTUALLY KIND.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.402
OR SO I THOUGHT.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.941
SHE HELPED ME THROW UP.

17:56.943 --> 17:58.943
HANNA...

17:58.945 --> 18:01.279
THAT'S<i> SO</i> DANGEROUS.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.914
I KNOW, AND...

18:02.916 --> 18:06.918
THAT WAS JUST SUCH A LOW
POINT IN MY LIFE THAT...

18:06.920 --> 18:08.619
I STARTED TAKING
BETTER CARE OF MYSELF.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.291
I KNEW I COULD BE
STRONGER THAN THAT.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.761
YEAH, AND YOU<i> ARE.</i>

18:24.938 --> 18:25.903
( sighs )

18:47.794 --> 18:50.161
HE IS SUCH A BITCH.

18:50.163 --> 18:51.129
( disgusted sigh )

19:12.452 --> 19:14.285
HEY. YOU OKAY?

19:14.287 --> 19:15.720
YEAH. I'M OKAY.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.561
DID YOU TAKE ANOTHER
LOOK AT MY PAPER?

20:30.563 --> 20:31.662
YES.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.404
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

20:40.406 --> 20:43.574
IT'S THE GRADE YOU EARNED.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.642
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS MEANS?

20:48.514 --> 20:50.548
HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU!

20:52.552 --> 20:54.218
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT IT MEANS.

21:04.998 --> 21:07.999
Woman: OH, MY GOSH,
THIS IS AMAZING!

21:08.001 --> 21:09.567
( indistinct conversation )

21:15.675 --> 21:19.143
WHY DON'T YOU SAVE US
THE COST OF A TRIAL
AND<i> DROP DEAD!</i>

21:23.683 --> 21:25.716
ICE CREAM IS SO GOOD.

21:37.597 --> 21:41.799
<i> ¶ YOUR HEART</i>
<i> GAVE UP THE FIGHT ¶</i>

21:41.801 --> 21:45.169
<i> ¶ DOWN, DOWN, DOWN ¶</i>

21:48.241 --> 21:50.908
<i> ¶ PLEASE DON'T TAKE HER ¶</i>

21:52.912 --> 21:55.780
<i> ¶ MY BREAD ALL WINTER ¶</i>

21:55.782 --> 21:57.915
<i> ¶ I'M GONE ¶</i>

21:57.917 --> 22:01.452
<i> ¶ LIKE THE LOVERS ¶</i>

22:01.454 --> 22:03.621
<i> ¶ GONE ¶</i>

22:03.623 --> 22:07.458
<i> ¶ LIKE THE LIARS ¶</i>

22:07.460 --> 22:08.559
<i> ¶ GONE ¶</i>

22:08.561 --> 22:12.363
<i> ¶ IS MY ACHIN' ¶</i>

22:12.365 --> 22:14.031
<i> ¶ GONE ¶</i>

22:14.033 --> 22:17.101
<i> ¶ IS MY LOVE ¶</i>

22:17.103 --> 22:18.736
<i> ¶ GONE ¶</i>

22:29.282 --> 22:31.315
WE NEED TO TALK.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.386
YOUR FRIEND
LEFT HER BACKPACK HERE.

22:35.388 --> 22:36.887
I RETURNED IT
TO HER PARENTS.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.196
ARE YOU DOING DRUGS
WITH HER? IS THAT WHAT
THIS WHOLE THING IS ABOUT?

22:45.198 --> 22:46.263
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

22:46.265 --> 22:49.100
ARE YOU STONED?
NO!

22:49.102 --> 22:50.968
LOOK, HONEY, I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO

22:50.970 --> 22:52.737
WITH HER BEING A GIRL.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.872
IF IT WERE A BOY...
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
GONE THROUGH HIS THINGS.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.741
ARE YOU LYING
TO YOURSELF OR ME?

22:56.743 --> 22:58.576
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE!

22:58.578 --> 23:00.311
YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THAT!

23:00.313 --> 23:01.846
YOU'RE NO LONGER
ALLOWED TO SEE HER.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.013
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.682
WATCH ME.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.550
THIS DOESN'T CHANGE
THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT HER!

23:11.290 --> 23:13.357
DON'T BOTHER
CALLING YOUR FATHER.

23:13.359 --> 23:15.626
HE'S AS DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU AS I AM.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.441
HEY, DINNER'S ALMOST READY.
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.910
( cell phone rings )

23:34.814 --> 23:37.348
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.
I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS CALL,

23:37.350 --> 23:39.350
BUT THEN WE ARE ALL
SITTING DOWN AT THIS TABLE

23:39.352 --> 23:41.519
AND HAVING DINNER
AS A FAMILY.

23:44.824 --> 23:48.292
SO WHAT WERE YOU
AND NOEL KAHN TALKING
ABOUT TODAY?

23:48.294 --> 23:49.760
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

23:49.762 --> 23:53.297
I SAW YOU WITH HIM
AT SCHOOL THIS MORNING.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.266
YEAH. SO?

23:55.268 --> 23:57.668
SO ARE YOU GUYS, LIKE,
FRIENDS NOW OR SOMETHING?

23:57.670 --> 23:59.170
WE HANG OUT A LITTLE.

23:59.172 --> 24:00.671
SINCE WHEN?

24:00.673 --> 24:02.173
I DON'T KNOW.

24:02.175 --> 24:03.507
A WHILE. WHY?

24:06.546 --> 24:09.547
HAS HE ASKED YOU
ANYTHING ABOUT ME?

24:09.549 --> 24:13.717
ABOUT MOM AND DAD?
HAVE YOU TOLD HIM ANYTHING?

24:13.719 --> 24:15.753
UH... LIKE WHAT?

24:15.755 --> 24:19.123
LOOK, NOEL, HE'S NOT
WHO YOU THINK HE IS.

24:19.125 --> 24:20.424
OKAY, HE'S NOT YOUR FRIEND.

24:23.529 --> 24:24.695
JEALOUS MUCH?

24:24.697 --> 24:25.696
STUPID MUCH?

24:28.201 --> 24:31.402
I'M SERIOUS, MIKE.
ARIA, IT WAS NOTHING.

24:31.404 --> 24:35.172
JUST TELLING ME ABOUT
SOME STUPID RUMOR
HE HAD HEARD.

24:35.174 --> 24:38.375
WHAT-- WHAT KIND OF RUMOR?

24:38.377 --> 24:41.512
WELL, SUPPOSABLY, UM,
THE ENGLISH TEACHER--

24:41.514 --> 24:44.248
YOU KNOW, THE ONE THAT
YOU THINK IS SO GREAT?--

24:44.250 --> 24:46.217
IS HAVING A THING
WITH ONE OF HIS STUDENTS.

24:46.219 --> 24:48.185
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, MIKE.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.920
ACCUSATIONS LIKE THAT
CAN RUIN SOMEONE'S LIFE.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.388
I'M NOT MAKING A JOKE.

24:51.390 --> 24:54.024
NOEL SWEARS THAT
HE SAW THEM TOGETHER,

24:54.026 --> 24:56.527
AND HE FEELS TERRIBLE
FOR THE GIRL, BUT...

24:56.529 --> 24:59.096
YOU KNOW, TOMORROW
HE'S GONNA TELL THE PRINCIPAL.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.931
ARIA...

25:00.933 --> 25:02.566
HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

25:06.639 --> 25:07.638
DAD...

25:10.076 --> 25:11.942
I'VE TOTALLY SCREWED UP.

25:18.251 --> 25:20.518
I PROMISED SPENCER THAT I'D
STUDY AT HER PLACE TONIGHT.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.653
WE'VE GOT THIS HUGE
MIDTERM TOMORROW.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.622
SHE'S TOTALLY GONNA KILL ME.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.495
( door opens, closes )

25:31.497 --> 25:34.031
SO, ARE WE GONNA EAT,
OR WHAT?

25:56.289 --> 25:57.788
( knocking on door )

26:13.673 --> 26:15.105
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

26:15.107 --> 26:17.875
IT'S OVER, ARIA.

26:17.877 --> 26:20.678
THE HIDING,
THE SNEAKING AROUND.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.012
IT-- IT'S OVER.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.581
WAIT, EZRA.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.950
NO, COME ON, YOU--
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.491
WHAT YOU AND I HAVE...

26:34.493 --> 26:38.162
IS THE MOST REAL
AND HONEST THING
IN MY LIFE.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.998
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
I HOPE YOU REMEMBER.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.169
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
TOMORROW, THAT WON'T CHANGE.

26:45.171 --> 26:48.172
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

26:48.174 --> 26:51.508
I'M NOT GONNA CHANGE
NOEL'S GRADE,

26:51.510 --> 26:54.979
AND I WILL NOT
LET HIM HURT YOU.

26:54.981 --> 26:59.049
IF I RESIGN TOMORROW
AND GET THE HELL
OUT OF ROSEWOOD,

26:59.051 --> 27:02.219
HE'LL HAVE NO REASON
TO TELL ANYBODY ABOUT US.

27:02.221 --> 27:08.359
HEY, EVEN THOUGH
THIS DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT,

27:08.361 --> 27:10.661
IT HAS ALWAYS<i> FELT</i> RIGHT,

27:10.663 --> 27:16.533
AND I WILL NOT LET HIM
CHANGE THIS INTO SOMETHING
THAT FEELS WRONG.

27:16.535 --> 27:17.768
I JUST CAN'T.

27:19.338 --> 27:20.904
CAN'T.

27:33.386 --> 27:34.852
I LOVE YOU.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.610
READY FOR MIDTERMS?

28:33.612 --> 28:34.912
NOT YET.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.714
MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE
A BREAK TOMORROW NIGHT.

28:36.716 --> 28:39.049
IAN AND I ARE TREATING
MOM AND DAD TO DINNER.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.551
I'D LIKE IT IF YOU CAME.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.720
YEAH, I'LL TRY, BUT...

28:42.722 --> 28:43.520
DO YOU NEED HELP?

28:44.924 --> 28:45.856
OH.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.294
AN OVULATION KIT?

28:50.296 --> 28:54.298
YOU WEREN'T
SUPPOSED TO SEE THAT.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.399
BUT I DID.

28:56.936 --> 28:58.469
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?

28:58.471 --> 29:00.270
OF COURSE.
I MEAN IT.

29:00.272 --> 29:02.473
THIS IS<i> NOT</i> SOMETHING
I'M PREPARED TO TELL
MOM AND DAD.

29:02.475 --> 29:04.108
OKAY.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.643
I'M TRYING TO GET PREGNANT.

29:08.614 --> 29:09.813
WITH IAN?

29:09.815 --> 29:11.482
OF COURSE.

29:11.484 --> 29:13.350
WH-WHY THE RUSH?

29:13.352 --> 29:15.452
WE WANT A BIG FAMILY,

29:15.454 --> 29:16.987
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
A GRANDMA WHEN MY KIDS
ARE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

29:16.989 --> 29:20.457
I'VE NEVER ONCE HEARD YOU
SAY YOU WANTED A BIG FAMILY.

29:20.459 --> 29:24.161
WELL, WE'VE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT IT, HAVE WE?

29:24.163 --> 29:27.131
WHAT ABOUT WHARTON?
YOU'VE WORKED SO HARD
TO GET IN.

29:27.133 --> 29:30.467
I'LL GET MY MBA, BUT...

29:30.469 --> 29:33.337
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I NEED TO BE THE BEST
AND THE FIRST ANYMORE.

29:33.339 --> 29:35.806
ALL THOSE THINGS THAT
USED TO MATTER JUST...

29:35.808 --> 29:38.809
DON'T SEEM THAT IMPORTANT.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.878
THOSE THINGS
WERE EVERYTHING FOR YOU.

29:40.880 --> 29:42.880
I DON'T EXPECT
YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

29:42.882 --> 29:45.849
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,
I WANTED EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.852
YOU WANTED THOSE THINGS
LAST WEEK.

29:48.854 --> 29:53.090
I'M HAPPY, SPENCER.
I<i> REALLY</i> AM.

29:53.092 --> 29:54.024
Okay.

29:58.197 --> 30:00.731
SO GETTING PREGNANT
IS YOUR IDEA,

30:00.733 --> 30:01.799
NOT IAN'S?

30:01.801 --> 30:03.567
YES.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.536
DON'T YOU
LOVE THE THOUGHT
OF A LITTLE "MINI-ME"

30:05.538 --> 30:07.871
OR "MINI IAN"
RUNNING AROUND?

30:07.873 --> 30:10.340
NOT REALLY.
Ian: MELISSA!

30:12.344 --> 30:15.913
I-I THOUGHT THIS WAS
SOMETHING WE WERE
GONNA KEEP PRIVATE.

30:15.915 --> 30:19.583
I KNOW, BUT I JUST--
I LOOKED IN THE BAG BEFORE
SHE COULD EVEN STOP ME.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.785
I PROMISE, I WON'T
TELL ANYONE.

30:21.787 --> 30:24.421
TRUST ME, SPENCER
CAN KEEP A SECRET.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.694
YEAH, I KNOW SHE CAN.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.702
( door closes )

30:51.784 --> 30:54.318
HEY. WHEN DID
YOU GET HOME?

30:54.320 --> 30:56.486
UH, JUST NOW.

30:56.488 --> 30:58.455
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH THAT?

30:58.457 --> 31:01.024
I'M GOING TO COOK IT.

31:01.026 --> 31:02.092
FOR DINNER?

31:02.094 --> 31:03.694
YEP.

31:03.696 --> 31:07.164
HANNA.
MOM.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.499
I KNOW WHEN YOU'RE BEING
DISHONEST WITH ME

31:09.501 --> 31:11.535
EVEN BEFORE
YOU START TALKING.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.872
YOU DO?
UH-HUH.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.473
SPILL IT.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.349
WHERE DID THAT MONEY
COME FROM?

31:25.351 --> 31:28.852
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN I'M
BEING DISHONEST WITH YOU
BEFORE I EVEN START TALKING?

31:28.854 --> 31:30.487
I'M WAITING.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.256
MORE WINE?

31:34.727 --> 31:37.094
HANNA.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.562
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO GET THIS MONEY?

31:40.232 --> 31:43.100
I FOUND IT IN THE BATHROOM,
AT LUCKY LEON'S.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.572
REALLY?

31:48.574 --> 31:49.840
REALLY.

31:51.577 --> 31:55.646
AND IT DIDN'T OCCUR
TO YOU TO TURN IT IN
TO THE MANAGER?

31:55.648 --> 31:57.381
NO, IT DIDN'T.

32:10.729 --> 32:12.763
FIND A BETTER PLACE
TO HIDE IT.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.267
HEY, MOM.
HM?

32:17.269 --> 32:19.102
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHEN I'M LYING?

32:19.104 --> 32:21.104
OH, I'M NOT GIVING THAT UP.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.240
OH, COME ON.
NOPE.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.142
FINE. I'LL FIGURE IT OUT
ON MY OWN.

32:25.144 --> 32:26.743
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.620
I AM STILL A VIRGIN.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.424
I AM<i> NOT</i> A VIRGIN.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.997
NO, I'LL JUST BORROW
SOMETHING OF SPENCER'S.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.768
YEAH, HER-- HER PARENTS
ARE HERE. THEY KNOW
I'M STAYING OVER.

32:53.973 --> 32:55.539
OKAY. GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

33:01.347 --> 33:05.382
OKAY, THAT
I WON'T LET YOU DO.

33:05.384 --> 33:06.783
WHAT?

33:08.153 --> 33:10.153
LOOK AT ME LIKE...

33:10.155 --> 33:12.055
THIS MIGHT BE
THE LAST TIME
YOU SEE ME.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.384
MELISSA PREGNANT?

33:40.386 --> 33:42.052
HEY, I SAID
THIS WAS A SECRET.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.453
NO, IT'S NOT A SECRET.

33:43.455 --> 33:45.589
IT'S A BOMBSHELL,
LIKE IN "NUKE-U-LAR."

33:45.591 --> 33:47.457
IT'S "NUCLEAR."

33:47.459 --> 33:49.626
"NUKE-LE-AR."

33:49.628 --> 33:51.595
OKAY, WHATEVER. IT'S
STILL A DISASTER MOVIE.

33:51.597 --> 33:52.896
I KNOW.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.264
CAN YOU IMAGINE
MELISSA PREGNANT?

33:54.266 --> 33:56.767
OR EVEN WORSE,
MELISSA AS A MOM?

33:56.769 --> 33:59.703
I'VE NEVER ONCE HEARD
MELISSA TALK ABOUT KIDS.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.505
NOW SHE WANTS TO HAVE
THIS HUGE FAMILY?

34:01.507 --> 34:03.173
HE'S TOTALLY
MANIPULATING HER.

34:03.175 --> 34:05.042
MANIPULATING HER?

34:05.044 --> 34:06.977
SPENCE, YOUR SISTER'S
A BAD-ASS.

34:06.979 --> 34:09.146
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE GONNA FIND,

34:09.148 --> 34:10.914
BUT I HAVE TO SEE
WHAT'S INSIDE THOSE BOXES.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.252
EMILY?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.422
HEY.

34:20.959 --> 34:23.160
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
TO SAY GOODBYE.

34:23.162 --> 34:24.928
TO WHO?

34:24.930 --> 34:27.030
MAYA.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.365
EM, WHERE IS SHE GOING?

34:28.367 --> 34:31.001
THEY'RE SENDING HER
TO JUVIE CAMP,

34:31.003 --> 34:32.636
FOR THREE MONTHS.

34:32.638 --> 34:33.970
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:35.307 --> 34:37.007
MY MOTHER.

34:37.009 --> 34:38.642
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

34:41.814 --> 34:43.580
<i> ¶ BUT I'VE ¶</i>

34:43.582 --> 34:45.582
<i> ¶ NEVER FELT THIS FEEL ¶</i>

34:45.584 --> 34:46.683
<i> ¶ SO HEAVY ¶</i>

34:48.454 --> 34:50.353
<i> ¶ AND I'VE ¶</i>

34:50.355 --> 34:52.189
<i> ¶ NEVER FELT THIS FEEL ¶</i>

34:52.191 --> 34:53.423
<i> ¶ SO LOW ¶</i>

34:55.794 --> 34:57.327
<i> ¶ YEAH, IT ¶</i>

34:57.329 --> 34:58.995
<i> ¶ IS AWAKE INSIDE ¶</i>

34:58.997 --> 35:01.998
<i> ¶ MY WHOLE SOUL ¶</i>

35:02.000 --> 35:03.834
<i> ¶ BUT YOU ¶</i>

35:03.836 --> 35:05.335
<i> ¶ ARE MY STRENGTH ¶</i>

35:05.337 --> 35:06.970
<i> ¶ I WON'T STAND ALONE ¶</i>

35:21.820 --> 35:23.353
Man: STEP ASIDE, PLEASE.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.721
Noel: SOMEBODY
SET ME UP, OKAY?

35:24.723 --> 35:27.190
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THIS ONE, MR. KAHN.

35:27.192 --> 35:28.792
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

35:28.794 --> 35:33.130
YOU STOLE THE ANSWERS
TO THREE MIDTERMS, MR. KAHN.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.565
I CAN'T IMAGINE EVER
BELIEVING IN YOU AGAIN.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.067
THIS IS REALLY
UNACCEPTABLE,

35:37.069 --> 35:39.102
AND I'M REALLY,
REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

35:46.078 --> 35:48.178
( cell phone beeps )

35:51.683 --> 35:53.350
( beep )

36:07.633 --> 36:10.233
I DON'T KNOW WHO
I'M MORE AFRAID OF--

36:10.235 --> 36:13.236
"A" THE BITCH WHO TRIED
TO FLATTEN HANNA,

36:13.238 --> 36:16.573
OR "A"
OUR NEW "FRIEN-EMY."

36:20.746 --> 36:22.078
WHAT?

36:22.080 --> 36:26.049
"A" SAVED MY RELATIONSHIP.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.251
YEAH, WELL, "A"
TRIED TO KILL ME.

36:28.253 --> 36:30.420
BECAUSE "A"
THOUGHT YOU SAW HER.

36:30.422 --> 36:33.290
"A" CLEARLY KNOWS NOW
THAT YOU DIDN'T.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.859
SO, THE LAW OF COSINES
IS AN EXTENSION OF

36:35.861 --> 36:38.195
THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM
TO THE ARBITRARY ANGLES...

36:38.197 --> 36:40.730
UH, ENGLISH, PLEASE.

36:40.732 --> 36:43.266
IT'S NICE TO SEE
THE POSSE TOGETHER AGAIN.

36:43.268 --> 36:44.801
THE POSSE?

36:44.803 --> 36:48.104
THIS IS ME
PLAYING NICE, ARIA.

36:48.106 --> 36:49.973
SPENCER AND I
HAVE CALLED A TRUCE.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.443
OH, WELL,
I'LL PLAY ALONG.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.612
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO BE MARRIED?

36:55.614 --> 36:57.047
IT FEELS LIKE...

36:57.049 --> 36:59.149
I DON'T HAVE TO TRY
SO HARD ALL THE TIME,

36:59.151 --> 37:00.850
LIKE THINGS ARE SETTLED.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.987
YEAH. THAT'S HOW MY MOM
FELT BEFORE MY DAD
MET ISABELLE.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.121
( chuckles )

37:05.123 --> 37:07.123
ONE THING I DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT

37:07.125 --> 37:09.192
IS IAN LOOKING AT
OTHER WOMEN.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.462
( sighs )
YOU READY, WIFE?

37:12.464 --> 37:15.799
I AM, MY HANDSOME HUSBAND.

37:15.801 --> 37:16.766
Ian: BYE.

37:28.113 --> 37:29.779
WHAT?

37:29.781 --> 37:33.617
THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO SHOW YOU,
IN MY ROOM.

37:33.619 --> 37:34.918
WAIT, NO.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.554
I THINK SHE SHOULD
FIND IT HERSELF.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.423
Hanna:
I AGREE, BUT FIRST...

37:46.598 --> 37:47.697
THERE.

37:47.699 --> 37:48.865
NOW YOU CAN GO.

37:48.867 --> 37:49.833
HM.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.640
GO.
GO.

38:13.458 --> 38:15.125
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE!

38:15.127 --> 38:17.460
I'M LEAVING
IN THE MORNING.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.629
I'M SO SORRY, MAYA.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.464
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

38:21.466 --> 38:25.869
DON'T SAY THAT.
IT'S NOT TRUE.

38:25.871 --> 38:30.206
I'VE LEFT YOU, LIKE,
A HUNDRED MESSAGES.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.509
AND WHEN YOU
DIDN'T CALL ME BACK,

38:32.511 --> 38:33.610
I THOUGHT THAT
YOU WERE MAD AT ME.

38:37.182 --> 38:38.782
MY PARENTS
BLOCKED MY PHONE.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.886
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

38:42.888 --> 38:46.556
I'D SAY IT TOOK A VILLAGE...

38:46.558 --> 38:49.292
AND A VERY TALL LADDER.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.700
HEY.

38:58.337 --> 38:59.436
LOOK AT THIS.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.806
EVERYONE KEPT THAT.

39:11.883 --> 39:12.849
Hanna: WHAT'S THIS?

39:15.754 --> 39:17.754
YOU GUYS, LOOK.
REALLY?

39:17.756 --> 39:19.356
IT'S FINE.
CREEPY.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.459
( laughter )

39:25.630 --> 39:28.565
YOU KNOW, I AM OFFICIALLY
JEALOUS OF EMILY'S LOVE LIFE.

39:32.671 --> 39:36.406
<i> ¶ LUANN, LUANN, LUANN ¶</i>

40:05.103 --> 40:08.772
WE'VE GOT COMIC BOOKS,
MORE COMIC BOOKS,

40:08.774 --> 40:12.108
AND... MORE COMIC BOOKS.

40:12.110 --> 40:15.445
EVIDENCE OF GEEKDOM,
BUT NOT A CRIME.

40:15.447 --> 40:16.679
Maya: HEY.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.314
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

40:26.758 --> 40:28.925
THANK YOU.
OF COURSE.

40:30.429 --> 40:31.694
YOU'LL BE BACK SOON.

40:52.017 --> 40:55.051
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU GUYS.

40:55.053 --> 40:58.655
TONIGHT WAS THE BEST GIFT
ANYONE COULD HAVE
EVER GIVEN ME.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.457
WHERE ARE THEY SENDING HER?

41:00.459 --> 41:03.259
SOMEPLACE CALLED
TRUE NORTH.

41:03.261 --> 41:04.461
SERIOUSLY?

41:04.463 --> 41:05.962
IS IT BAD?

41:05.964 --> 41:08.465
THEY SENT BETSY BERGER THERE
FOR HUFFING SPRAY PAINT.

41:08.467 --> 41:10.300
SHE CAME BACK AS A DRUMMER
IN A GOSPEL BAND.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.003
MAYA'S AN AMAZING PERSON, EM.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.673
SHE'S--
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

41:16.675 --> 41:17.740
Yeah.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.077
DID YOU GUYS FIND ANYTHING?

41:21.079 --> 41:23.146
WE'VE LOOKED THROUGH
EVERY BOX

41:23.148 --> 41:25.682
AND FOUND A BIG,
