WEBVTT

00:53.140 --> 00:55.838
- Guys, I saw the alert.
Meta attack downtown.

00:55.881 --> 00:58.319
I'm on my way.
- Sounds good, Flash.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.625
- Kamilla?
Is that you?

01:00.669 --> 01:03.498
- Uh, yeah.
- And Chester P. Runk, sir!

01:03.541 --> 01:06.327
Ready to assist you
in all your superhero needs.

01:06.370 --> 01:08.024
- Why are you two on comms?

01:08.068 --> 01:10.374
- Uh, Kamilla let me in.
- We're the only ones here.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.376
Frost is at A.R.G.U.S.,
checking on Bloodwork.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.118
Cisco's off the grid,
cataloging post-Crisis metas.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.337
Iris is on a story--

01:16.380 --> 01:17.425
- And Ralph is
who-knows-where,

01:17.468 --> 01:19.035
tracing down Sue Dearbon.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.384
Okay, no worries.
I'll do this solo.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.125
- Are you sure you
don't want some help?

01:22.169 --> 01:24.258
'Cause, I mean,
I'm--I'm ready, willing,

01:24.301 --> 01:26.608
and caffeinated, sir.
Put me in, coach!

01:26.651 --> 01:29.350
- Thanks, Chester,
but I'm good.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.811
Hartley Rathaway.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.378
Since when are you
a diamond thief?

01:57.421 --> 01:59.641
- It's Pied Piper, Flash.

01:59.684 --> 02:01.425
And you're really
gonna ask me that

02:01.469 --> 02:04.341
after what you and your friends
did to me?

02:04.385 --> 02:07.388
- Uh, what did we do?

02:07.431 --> 02:08.867
- Wow, Flash.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.740
My brother,
that is epically cold.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.308
How do you not remember?
It was really bad.

02:14.351 --> 02:17.137
- Oh, great.
Another Crisis change.

02:17.180 --> 02:20.966
- Apparently, there's something
else you don't remember.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.491
The gauntlets are just
my backup singers.

02:23.534 --> 02:27.059
- Wait, what?

02:29.236 --> 02:31.412
Great.

02:31.455 --> 02:33.544
He can fly now.
- No worries, Flash.

02:33.588 --> 02:35.677
P-Runk is all over it.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.418
That sonic boom had
a specific frequency.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.202
If I scan
for the same wavelength,

02:39.246 --> 02:40.899
I think we can...

02:40.943 --> 02:42.336
VoilÃ !

02:42.379 --> 02:44.816
- Flash, Rathaway's
at 52nd and Palm.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.775
- All right, I'm on it.
I'll take Broadway.

02:46.818 --> 02:50.213
- Uh, I wouldn't do that, sir.
- Why not?

02:50.257 --> 02:54.391
- Because there's a--

02:54.435 --> 02:56.393
- Whoa!

02:56.437 --> 02:58.308
Since when was there
a train here?

02:58.352 --> 03:00.963
- Since always.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.899
- System update complete.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.335
Is there anything else,
Barry Allen?

03:25.379 --> 03:27.207
Uh, just one more tweak.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.078
In--in the meantime, I wouldn't
mind knowing everything

03:29.121 --> 03:31.733
that Crisis changed before
I run back into the field.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.517
- Calculating...

03:33.561 --> 03:36.825
- Calculating...

03:36.868 --> 03:39.175
- Calculating...

03:45.355 --> 03:47.270
Barry Allen is The Flash.

03:49.054 --> 03:52.057
- Yeah, I already knew that.
- What?

03:53.407 --> 03:55.278
A-actually, you know what?
When I think about it,

03:55.322 --> 03:57.672
it does kinda make sense.
The whole S.T.A.R. Labs

03:57.715 --> 04:00.370
super-facility...
Plus, the same voice

04:00.414 --> 04:04.548
every time The Flash came
to visit me at the M.A.C.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.769
And that jawline, though?
Very distinctive.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.074
- Hmm.
Listen, guys, I'm sorry.

04:09.118 --> 04:11.120
I'm kinda--
I'm kinda busy right now.

04:11.163 --> 04:12.382
- Well, what are you
working on?

04:12.426 --> 04:14.123
- I--
- Analysis complete,

04:14.166 --> 04:16.256
Barry Allen.
I've calculated approximately

04:16.299 --> 04:19.694
3.725 trillion changes.
Would you like to hear them

04:19.737 --> 04:21.696
in order of causality?
- Whoa.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.394
Is this a mobile interactive
artificial intelligence unit?

04:24.438 --> 04:26.527
- Um, yeah, it--it is.

04:26.570 --> 04:27.528
I'm--I'm just trying
to upgrade it.

04:27.571 --> 04:29.269
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

04:29.312 --> 04:31.662
- You know, if you just flip
the positronic solenoid--

04:31.706 --> 04:33.447
- Hey, you know, please, um--

04:33.490 --> 04:36.580
You don't mess with that.
It's, uh, it's sensitive stuff,

04:36.624 --> 04:38.887
and, uh, you know, you're not
on the team, Chester.

04:38.930 --> 04:42.325
- Yeah, totally.
Uh, I guess I'll cross

04:42.369 --> 04:45.546
the whole superhero
tech support

04:45.589 --> 04:47.112
off my list
of career possibilities.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.768
Anyways, uh, if you'll
excuse-moi...

04:50.812 --> 04:53.858
I'm Jitters-bound.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.863
- He's just trying to help.
- Oh, I know.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.388
I know. It's--

05:01.431 --> 05:03.215
So much has changed...

05:03.259 --> 05:06.262
after Crisis, and...

05:06.306 --> 05:07.872
You know, this morning,
when I got the meta alert,

05:07.916 --> 05:13.487
I was trying to find
my parents' graves.

05:13.530 --> 05:16.533
There's not even a cemetery
there anymore.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.623
I--I searched every graveyard

05:19.667 --> 05:23.932
in Central City.
I still can't find them.

05:23.975 --> 05:26.195
Just feel like a piece of me

05:26.238 --> 05:28.023
is missing.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.155
And friends
like Hartley Rathaway

05:30.199 --> 05:31.766
are enemies now.

05:31.809 --> 05:37.685
Just--everything
is so different.

05:37.728 --> 05:39.600
- I'll bet hearing
different voices on comms

05:39.643 --> 05:41.079
doesn't help, either.

05:41.123 --> 05:44.692
You want something familiar.
That's not us.

05:44.735 --> 05:46.520
- Hey, I didn't mean it
like that.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.784
- It's okay, Barry.
I understand.

05:49.827 --> 05:53.091
Just maybe take
it easy on Chester.

05:53.135 --> 05:54.571
If he seems a little
overeager,

05:54.615 --> 05:57.357
it's because he idolizes
The Flash.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.185
You're his hero.

06:00.229 --> 06:03.101
I'll, uh, let you
get back to it.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.980
- There's gotta be
some sort of logic to it.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.591
Walk me through the night
of the particle accelerator

06:14.635 --> 06:19.509
explosion again.
What were you doing?

06:19.553 --> 06:23.165
- Like I told you...

06:23.208 --> 06:25.341
I was starting R-CEM tests
that night.

06:25.385 --> 06:30.651
I just finished the prototype.
My life's work was ready.

06:30.694 --> 06:34.829
- Wait, you finished building
your machine?

06:34.872 --> 06:36.570
- Yeah.
- Can you build one here?

06:36.613 --> 06:40.530
- I did, but we can't use it.
- Eva, we at least have to try.

06:44.882 --> 06:48.277
- What are you so afraid of?

06:48.320 --> 06:50.410
- I...

06:53.761 --> 06:57.504
- Eva, I get it.
I do.

06:57.547 --> 07:00.681
But I've read your research.

07:00.724 --> 07:02.726
You were brilliant.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.468
You were the best
in your field.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.472
- And that is
good enough for me.

07:09.516 --> 07:13.345
- You're so brave.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.913
I guess we'll be brave
together, then.

07:20.178 --> 07:23.573
- So this is
a residual particle catcher.

07:23.617 --> 07:28.752
It can detect and detain
molecular afterglow of things.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.624
- Okay
- Mm-hmm.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.495
- And you need me to do what?
- Oh, I need you to help me

07:32.539 --> 07:36.717
charge this so I can catch him.
Them. Particles.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.110
Catch the particles.
- Why are you so nervous,

07:39.154 --> 07:40.982
and what are these "particles"
you're trying to catch?

07:41.025 --> 07:43.027
- Uh, noth--they're just--
they're--

07:43.071 --> 07:45.856
They're scientific anomalies.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.076
You wouldn't understand.

07:48.119 --> 07:51.514
There's the Nash Wells we know
and can barely stand.

07:51.558 --> 07:55.866
And I'm guessing anomalies
because of Crisis?

07:57.694 --> 08:00.523
Boss Lady told me.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.786
Yeah, you never did like being
kept in the dark, did you?

08:02.830 --> 08:05.572
- Why do you always act like
you've known me forever?

08:05.615 --> 08:07.661
It's weird.

08:09.924 --> 08:11.969
I...

08:13.710 --> 08:16.147
Don't know what
you're talking about.

08:16.191 --> 08:21.588
- Well, that's not true, is it?

08:21.631 --> 08:24.373
You're such a liar.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.158
- What?
I mean...

08:27.202 --> 08:28.551
It's, uh--yes.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.249
The residual particle catcher
is ready, thank you.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.686
So if you would, please,

08:32.729 --> 08:35.558
can you, um, help me,
uh, charge it?

08:35.602 --> 08:36.690
Just blast it with

08:36.733 --> 08:38.648
a ultra-powered UV ray
right there.

08:38.692 --> 08:41.042
- Wh-where?
- There, right--

08:41.085 --> 08:43.218
Just aim for the...

08:43.261 --> 08:45.133
The absorption panel

08:45.176 --> 08:48.440
on the front pylon, thank you.
- Okay, keep your panties on.

08:48.484 --> 08:51.748
- That contraption
is not going to work.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.587
- Ooh.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.862
- Hey, are you okay?

09:18.906 --> 09:21.865
- Who the hell is she?

09:21.909 --> 09:24.868
- She--
That's--

09:24.912 --> 09:26.522
That's--it's just someone
I used to know.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.785
- Well, she looks a lot
like my doppelganger.

09:28.829 --> 09:30.047
Why do you have
a picture of her?

09:30.091 --> 09:31.353
- It doesn't ma--
it doesn't matter.

09:31.396 --> 09:32.659
- It does to me!

09:32.702 --> 09:36.532
Dude, this is too weird.
You know, I had a feeling

09:36.576 --> 09:38.882
something was off with you
from the beginning,

09:38.926 --> 09:41.232
but I kept ignoring it,
because I was just happy

09:41.276 --> 09:43.757
to find another person
who actually believed in me.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.020
- Okay.
- But this whole time,

09:46.063 --> 09:50.328
when you looked at me,
you saw this other person.

09:50.372 --> 09:53.941
God, that is messed up,
you know?

10:01.731 --> 10:05.605
- Okay, all right.

10:05.648 --> 10:08.651
Let's try this again, Gideon.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.721
What the hell?

10:49.387 --> 10:52.869
- Oh, good, you're awake.
- Oh, Caitlin.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.741
Thank God. What the--
w-what the hell is going on?

10:54.784 --> 10:55.916
I mean, one minute,

10:55.959 --> 10:57.352
I'm in the speed lab,
fixing Gideon,

10:57.395 --> 10:58.832
and the next thing I know,
I'm here.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.485
My speed's gone.

11:00.529 --> 11:03.706
- Quite the little chatterbox
today, aren't we?

11:03.750 --> 11:05.708
- What?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.971
W-why are you
talking to me like that?

11:08.015 --> 11:11.061
And why am I in a cage?

11:11.105 --> 11:16.588
Caitlin, let me out of here!

11:16.632 --> 11:18.939
- Easy, killer.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.423
- Thawne?

11:25.467 --> 11:26.816
- You're quite the specimen,
aren't you?

11:26.860 --> 11:28.644
- Go to hell.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.647
I don't know how you managed
to drag me back to the past.

11:32.604 --> 11:37.435
Whatever all this is,
I will stop you.

11:37.479 --> 11:38.915
- Cranky.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.048
What, did you offer him
the B-word?

11:41.091 --> 11:42.745
- Maybe he just needs
some privacy.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.052
I'm gonna go check on Ronnie.
He's working on a new space

11:45.095 --> 11:48.620
he's very excited about.
He's calling it the Pipeline.

11:48.664 --> 11:52.886
- Hmm.
The Pipeline.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.975
I like the sound of that.
- Caitlin.

11:55.018 --> 11:57.760
- I'll come with you.
- Caitlin.

11:57.804 --> 12:01.155
Caitlin, do not trust him!

12:04.854 --> 12:06.638
- Hey, baby girl.

12:06.682 --> 12:09.729
To what do I owe the pleasure
of this visit?

12:09.772 --> 12:11.774
- Well, a good lead, hopefully.
- Hmm.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.950
- I'm working
on our Black Hole story,

12:13.994 --> 12:15.473
and I have reached
a major dead end,

12:15.517 --> 12:17.388
and I was hoping that maybe
you found something new

12:17.432 --> 12:18.999
on Joseph Carver
that could help.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.871
- Ah, as a matter of fact,
I have,

12:21.915 --> 12:26.310
but I can't share it with you.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.142
Are you being serious?
- Uh, well, look.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.405
This Carver case has become

12:34.449 --> 12:37.365
a RICO investigation.
I have to report directly

12:37.408 --> 12:39.280
to Chief Singh.
We have to do everything

12:39.323 --> 12:41.021
by the book.
- Barry told me that you

12:41.064 --> 12:42.979
were the one that gave him
the advice to trust me

12:43.023 --> 12:45.025
with the Mirror Gun,
and now you can't even trust me

12:45.068 --> 12:46.635
with this?
- Oh, Iris, that weapon

12:46.678 --> 12:50.334
was Team Flash territory.
This Is CCPD business,

12:50.378 --> 12:53.033
and it has to stay that way.
Otherwise, Carver could skate

12:53.076 --> 12:55.252
with a collusion charge.
- Dad, Carver is mine.

12:55.296 --> 12:58.342
You can't just shut me out.

13:01.041 --> 13:04.784
- I didn't--I didn't mean that.
I, um...

13:04.827 --> 13:06.829
This just--it--
it means a lot to me.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.831
- I can see that.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.703
But baby girl,
there is nothing I can do.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.793
My hands are tied.
I'm sorry.

13:17.187 --> 13:19.973
- Yeah, I'm sorry too.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.975
We both have a job to do,

13:22.018 --> 13:24.064
and I respect that.

13:24.107 --> 13:26.022
- Hmm.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.503
- I, um--I'm about
to get some lunch.

13:28.546 --> 13:31.201
Do you maybe wanna join me
for some Big Belly Burger?

13:31.245 --> 13:34.161
My treat.
- Now that I would love.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.771
But I got a few things
to finish, okay?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.207
- Yeah, no worries.
You wanna meet me there

13:37.251 --> 13:38.818
at noon?

13:38.861 --> 13:40.167
- That's perfect.
See you there.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.647
- Okay.
- All right.

13:44.214 --> 13:46.956
- Oh, come on, come on.
Just--just one game.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.305
- I just spent
the last two hours

13:48.349 --> 13:50.090
at A.R.G.U.S.,
talking to Ramsey.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.787
I do not wanna play pinball.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.745
Besides, I know the only reason
you're hanging around

13:53.789 --> 13:55.138
is 'cause you wanna work
things out with Barry,

13:55.182 --> 13:56.879
so just go do it.
- What--I'm--

13:56.923 --> 13:59.273
I'm working my way up to it.
It's just, you know,

13:59.316 --> 14:01.318
up until today, the worst thing
I'd ever done before

14:01.362 --> 14:05.453
is drown my grandmother's car.

14:05.496 --> 14:08.021
Uh, don't try to build
a hovercraft at age 11.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.718
It doesn't work out.

14:09.761 --> 14:11.676
- Didn't you create
a literal black hole

14:11.720 --> 14:13.026
over Central City?

14:15.289 --> 14:17.726
Oh, you think Barry's
still mad about that too?

14:17.769 --> 14:19.075
- Would you stop?

14:19.119 --> 14:20.598
- No, no, I wasn't even awake
when that happened.

14:20.642 --> 14:23.688
- I mean, it's not like
you killed him.

14:25.603 --> 14:28.911
- Barry!

14:28.955 --> 14:30.782
Barry?

14:35.004 --> 14:37.789
- I can't help you
if you won't talk to me.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.270
Use your signs.
- What are you doing?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.320
- Nothing?

14:46.363 --> 14:48.278
Well, everybody's got good days
and bad days.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.846
Gorillas are no different.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.429
This isn't the past.

15:08.472 --> 15:11.954
It's a mindscape.
I'm in...

15:11.998 --> 15:15.001
That's right, Barry Allen.

15:15.044 --> 15:18.178
- You're in Grodd's mind now.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.929
- What's the matter, Grodd?
Got lonely at A.R.G.U.S.,

15:29.972 --> 15:32.453
so you decided to break out,
come visit me?

15:32.496 --> 15:35.238
Grodd is still in his prison

15:35.282 --> 15:39.199
in the mental coma you
and your team put him in.

15:39.242 --> 15:41.592
- Hmm.

15:41.636 --> 15:45.640
So, what, the cage is payback?

15:45.683 --> 15:48.599
What, you want vengeance?
- Not vengeance.

15:48.643 --> 15:51.602
Understanding.
Grodd wants Barry Allen

15:51.646 --> 15:54.040
to see what it's like
to have nothing.

15:54.083 --> 15:58.392
No powers, no freedom.
Only captivity.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.611
Caitlin used
a neural inhibitor

16:00.655 --> 16:04.006
to shut down
Grodd's cerebrum.

16:04.050 --> 16:08.184
Caitlin betrayed Grodd.

16:08.228 --> 16:11.753
But you gave her the authority.
This is your doing, Flash.

16:11.796 --> 16:14.190
- I'd do it again
in a heartbeat.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.844
Your mind is a weapon.

16:15.887 --> 16:20.022
- You take a weapon from a man,
he's still a man.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.893
You took Grodd's mind,

16:21.937 --> 16:24.635
Grodd's greatest gift.
That is not punishment.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.637
That is cruelty,
pure cruelty.

16:26.681 --> 16:31.077
- No, no.
Not from where I'm standing.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.209
Does that great mind of yours

16:33.253 --> 16:37.387
remember how many people
you've hurt?

16:37.431 --> 16:39.868
Huh?

16:39.911 --> 16:43.089
You marched an army of gorillas
through Central City.

16:43.132 --> 16:45.308
You forced me
into a gladiator arena

16:45.352 --> 16:47.049
with Solovar.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.704
You weaponized
King Shark's telepathic crown

16:49.747 --> 16:53.795
so you could control
thousands of innocent people.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.015
Face it, Grodd.
You got what you deserved.

17:01.759 --> 17:04.284
- You are right.

17:04.327 --> 17:07.417
- It took Grodd a year
to find the strength

17:07.461 --> 17:10.464
to think intelligently again,

17:10.507 --> 17:15.730
and in that time, Grodd had
many...primitive thoughts.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.993
- And without the power
of higher thinking,

17:18.037 --> 17:21.605
Grodd could no longer
lie to himself

17:21.649 --> 17:25.218
and was forced to confront
the truth of his actions,

17:25.261 --> 17:28.351
his wrongdoings, his crimes.

17:28.395 --> 17:32.355
- Your accident allowed
Grodd to enter your mind,

17:32.399 --> 17:36.664
not to harm Flash,
but to ask for Flash's help.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.274
- The neural inhibitor

17:38.318 --> 17:41.277
put a gatekeeper
in Grodd's mind.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.236
The portal
that gatekeeper guards

17:43.279 --> 17:47.196
is the only way out
of this prison.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.938
Help Grodd.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.288
Grodd is sorry.

17:52.332 --> 17:55.291
Grodd has changed.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.293
- Says the super-intelligent
gorilla

17:57.337 --> 18:00.427
who just kidnapped me.

18:00.470 --> 18:04.126
Who won't even show his face.

18:14.397 --> 18:17.879
Grodd wants Flash
to trust him.

18:20.273 --> 18:23.319
Your powers are returned.

18:23.363 --> 18:24.929
Please, Flash.

18:24.973 --> 18:29.108
Help Grodd
defeat the gatekeeper.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.385
Nice try, Grodd.

18:45.428 --> 18:48.388
But you'll never change.

18:48.431 --> 18:51.434
You're exactly where
you belong.

18:54.263 --> 18:56.744
- That's one crazy
cappuccino maker.

18:56.787 --> 18:57.875
- Close.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.138
Sherloque's machine
was developed

18:59.181 --> 19:00.182
to put one person's mind

19:00.226 --> 19:02.053
into another person's memories.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.534
- Wait, you think Barry's
in someone else's mind?

19:04.578 --> 19:06.536
- I mean, we've had experience
with this before.

19:06.580 --> 19:08.930
Based on Barry's pulse,
his rapid eye movement,

19:08.973 --> 19:10.627
and his vitals...

19:10.671 --> 19:13.369
And the two brainwaves
are a dead giveaway.

19:13.413 --> 19:16.459
This is so awesome.

19:16.503 --> 19:20.071
Awesome. Awesome.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.250
I mean, no,
this is just awful.

19:24.293 --> 19:26.382
We should, uh--
we should fix that.

19:26.426 --> 19:27.688
- Yeah.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.385
When Ramsey decided to take
a little vacation

19:29.429 --> 19:31.822
inside Barry's brain,
Cisco and I decided to work

19:31.866 --> 19:33.781
on the Memory Machine
just in case Bloodwork

19:33.824 --> 19:36.479
decided to resurface.
- How's all this work?

19:36.523 --> 19:40.048
- In a mindscape, the host
transmits neural signals

19:40.091 --> 19:42.050
to the guest's
primary motor cortex.

19:42.093 --> 19:44.922
If we can sync up
with those neural transmitters,

19:44.966 --> 19:46.620
I think we can communicate
with Barry.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.578
- Like sliding
into his mind DM's.

19:48.622 --> 19:49.579
- Sweet.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.500
- Come on, Barry.
- Frost.

19:57.544 --> 20:00.503
You and me, outside.
Let's go.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.161
- Harrison Wells is alive?

20:06.205 --> 20:10.731
- That's a really long story.
- Okay.

20:10.774 --> 20:13.037
- Make it fast, or I'm out.
- Ah, now, look.

20:13.081 --> 20:16.606
So it turns out that Allegra,
through a--you know,

20:16.650 --> 20:19.130
series of unfortunate events,
she has discovered...

20:19.174 --> 20:21.002
- That's she's
your daughter's doppelganger?

20:21.045 --> 20:22.351
- Not my daughter, exactly.
More like an employee, right?

20:22.395 --> 20:23.918
An ex-employee--
How do you know that?

20:23.961 --> 20:25.876
- Whatever.
I'm guessing it didn't go well

20:25.920 --> 20:29.706
because she found out rather
than you explaining it to her.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.752
So now it's time for some
good old-fashioned honesty.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.493
- Oh, come on.
- Whatever happened between

20:33.536 --> 20:35.190
you and your daughter--
- It's not my daughter,

20:35.234 --> 20:36.800
exactly--okay, more like
an employee, an ex-employee

20:36.844 --> 20:39.499
who made a bad call.
- Just explain it to her.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.935
- Yeah, but she said
it was too late for that.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.416
- Well, as my life coach,
Ralph, would say,

20:43.459 --> 20:45.896
you can't let that stop you.

20:48.769 --> 20:51.337
- Ralph is your life coach?

20:56.385 --> 20:58.474
Finally, there it is.

21:02.391 --> 21:03.566
Time to get out of here.

21:06.352 --> 21:09.050
Solovar?

21:09.093 --> 21:10.878
You're the gatekeeper?

21:20.235 --> 21:22.193
- Solovar, listen.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.326
We do not have to fight.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.371
As far as I'm concerned,

21:25.414 --> 21:27.286
Grodd can stay in this coma
forever.

21:27.329 --> 21:30.463
- I am the warden
of this prison, Flash.

21:30.506 --> 21:34.815
None shall escape.
Not even you.

21:34.858 --> 21:36.295
- Oh, great.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.044
- Barry's body is reacting
to whatever's happening

21:47.088 --> 21:49.003
in the mindscape.
- So if he dies in there,

21:49.046 --> 21:51.135
he dies out here too?
- Correct.

21:51.179 --> 21:52.354
- Do you have any sedatives?

21:52.398 --> 21:53.573
- No, those don't work
on speedsters.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.357
- No, no, no, no.
I meant--I meant for me.

22:17.727 --> 22:20.687
- Uh, Frost, you've got
that look Cisco has

22:20.730 --> 22:22.558
before he throws a bunch
of science words at us

22:22.602 --> 22:23.777
that basically means
"we're frakked."

22:23.820 --> 22:25.474
- The signals traveling
to Barry's cortex

22:25.518 --> 22:27.041
are moving
at a hyper-neural speed.

22:27.084 --> 22:28.521
We've only seen
one other brain

22:28.564 --> 22:32.699
whose neurons can fire
this fast.

22:32.742 --> 22:35.136
Barry's in Grodd's mind.

22:35.179 --> 22:37.312
- Gorilla Grodd?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.487
Damn.
Yo, he is, like,

22:38.531 --> 22:39.967
my favorite supervillain ever!

22:40.010 --> 22:43.362
He's, like, super strong,
is super smart,

22:43.405 --> 22:47.453
and...Barry's super trapped
in his mind,

22:47.496 --> 22:48.584
which is very, very bad.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.630
- We modified Grodd's
telepathic crown

22:50.673 --> 22:52.632
to keep him in a coma
at A.R.G.U.S.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.764
But its neural-inhibiting
capabilities

22:54.808 --> 22:57.550
can only sustain one mind.
Before long,

22:57.593 --> 23:00.466
the mindscape will overload
and crumble.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.077
If that happens
and Barry's still inside...

23:03.120 --> 23:05.601
- He would die.
Well, can't we just call

23:05.645 --> 23:07.386
A.R.G.U.S. and ask them
to shut it off?

23:07.429 --> 23:09.388
- Uh, no.
If we do that

23:09.431 --> 23:11.781
while Barry's still
connected to Grodd's mind,

23:11.825 --> 23:13.870
he'll be trapped
in there forever.

23:13.914 --> 23:17.047
I--I still don't understand
how this happened.

23:17.091 --> 23:20.311
How did Grodd get inside
Barry's mind?

23:20.355 --> 23:23.445
- Because of me.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.707
When I tweaked this earlier,

23:24.751 --> 23:27.667
I adjusted
its hypothalamic connection...

23:27.710 --> 23:28.798
by a factor of 900%.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.147
Okay.

23:30.191 --> 23:32.149
Well, that's more
than enough signal

23:32.193 --> 23:34.021
for another brain
to piggyback on.

23:34.064 --> 23:39.287
And Barry was wearing that
when he was whammied.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.028
- I am so sorry.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.465
I--I never should've came here.

23:43.509 --> 23:47.295
This is all my fault.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.911
- Hey.

23:54.955 --> 23:56.783
How's you running away
gonna help us get

23:56.826 --> 23:59.002
Barry out of Grodd's mind?
- Because if I'm not around,

23:59.046 --> 24:00.569
at least I can't
make things worse.

24:00.613 --> 24:02.266
-  Look, I hate
to break it to you,

24:02.310 --> 24:04.573
but accidentally putting
Barry's life in danger

24:04.617 --> 24:06.009
is kind of a rite of passage
around here.

24:06.053 --> 24:09.448
We've all done it:
Cisco, me, Ralph,

24:09.491 --> 24:10.536
even the janitor.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.102
He put too much wax
on the floor.

24:12.146 --> 24:13.539
But then, after we put
his life in danger,

24:13.582 --> 24:15.758
we figure out a plan
to get him out of it.

24:15.802 --> 24:18.631
So now it's your turn.

24:20.328 --> 24:23.505
You know, in the sixth grade,
I got into the science fair

24:23.549 --> 24:24.941
with a "Millennium Falcon"
that I built

24:24.985 --> 24:27.509
out of used vacuum parts.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.511
I mean, it--it flew

24:29.555 --> 24:31.644
and everything, like a drone.

24:31.687 --> 24:34.168
But on the day of the fair,

24:34.211 --> 24:36.518
it didn't fly.

24:36.562 --> 24:39.956
Uh, rust in the intake manifold
was preventing air from getting

24:40.000 --> 24:44.613
into the combustion,
which was then causing it to...

24:44.657 --> 24:48.878
Sorry.
Anyway,

24:48.922 --> 24:52.186
I had begged my teacher
to let me fix it

24:52.229 --> 24:55.755
and then fly again
the next day.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.757
He said no.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.889
You know why?

25:03.066 --> 25:05.678
He was an old school brother.

25:05.721 --> 25:07.941
And he said...

25:07.984 --> 25:14.643
that in the real world,
people like us...

25:14.687 --> 25:17.516
we don't get
a second chance.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.521
- Hold on.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.179
I'm not gonna pretend
like I have any idea

25:29.223 --> 25:31.225
what your life has been like,

25:31.268 --> 25:33.575
and I know that some
of the stuff we do in here

25:33.619 --> 25:36.665
has nothing to do
with the real world,

25:36.709 --> 25:40.800
but I'm offering you
a second chance.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.456
Because you deserve one.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.503
'Cause we all do.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.818
- Dad, I'm so sorry.
I don't know how

25:58.861 --> 26:01.516
I made that mistake.
I--I thought I said 12:30.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.214
- Not a problem.
I'll order you the usual.

26:04.258 --> 26:06.608
- Yeah, that sounds great.
I'll be there soon.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.523
Love you.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.760
- Ready to do this?
- Yes.

26:28.804 --> 26:31.807
No.
I don't know.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.897
- Eva, look at me.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.769
- Trust yourself.
You can do this.

26:36.812 --> 26:38.597
- It's the machine
I don't trust.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.947
The subatomic particles
this emits will penetrate

26:40.990 --> 26:43.645
the mirror's surface,
but it won't pierce the barrier

26:43.689 --> 26:45.038
between the worlds.
It will fail.

26:45.081 --> 26:48.432
- Then we're no worse off
than we are right now.

26:48.476 --> 26:49.782
- I made the mirror pieces
move.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.392
Let's just go back
to trying that.

26:51.435 --> 26:53.046
- Eva, we should be trying
everything we can

26:53.089 --> 26:55.222
to get out of here, right?

26:55.265 --> 26:56.789
- I...

26:59.966 --> 27:01.837
- There's another reason
why you don't want me

27:01.881 --> 27:03.186
to use this machine,
isn't there?

27:03.230 --> 27:06.059
- No, I--I--I...
I--I better go lie down.

27:06.102 --> 27:10.977
- Eva, w-what are you hiding?
- Nothing!

27:11.020 --> 27:13.632
- Why don't I believe you?

27:13.675 --> 27:17.636
Trust me, we can't use it.
- Why can't we use it?

27:17.679 --> 27:19.899
- Because of this!

27:26.732 --> 27:27.776
Oh, my--
- Eva!

27:37.873 --> 27:40.746
You're Joe now?

27:40.789 --> 27:42.704
Oh.
- When Flash sees Grodd,

27:42.748 --> 27:45.576
he sees an enemy from his past.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.709
Grodd wants Flash
to see a face he can trust.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.102
- And having me fight Solovar

27:49.145 --> 27:50.843
was supposed
to make me trust you?

27:50.886 --> 27:53.193
- Grodd thought Flash
could beat him.

27:53.236 --> 27:58.111
- You were wrong!
He almost killed me!

27:58.154 --> 27:59.939
But that was your plan,
wasn't it?

27:59.982 --> 28:00.896
- No.

28:04.247 --> 28:05.509
- What's that?
What's happening?

28:05.553 --> 28:06.728
Is that Solovar?

28:06.772 --> 28:09.078
- This world is crumbling.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.820
The neural inhibitor
can no longer take

28:11.864 --> 28:14.605
the strain of two minds.

28:14.649 --> 28:17.086
- What happens
to this mindscape if it fails?

28:17.130 --> 28:22.788
- Both Grodd and Flash
die together.

28:22.831 --> 28:25.442
- You wanted revenge so badly
that you were willing to die

28:25.486 --> 28:29.490
just to take me with you?
- No.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.931
Grodd has changed.

28:35.975 --> 28:38.717
- Nothing could ever
make you change.

28:38.760 --> 28:44.897
- Not even the Crisis
of Infinite Worlds?

28:44.940 --> 28:46.855
- How do you know
about Crisis?

28:46.899 --> 28:49.902
- Grodd's mind wasn't affected

28:49.945 --> 28:52.034
by the merging
of the multiverse,

28:52.078 --> 28:56.343
but Grodd can still sense
changes in the reality,

28:56.386 --> 29:01.565
changes like Gorilla City.
City is here now.

29:01.609 --> 29:06.179
The gorillas are here now.
Grodd knows this.

29:06.222 --> 29:09.225
Grodd wants to return home.
- Why?

29:09.269 --> 29:11.837
So you can create another army
to attack Central City

29:11.880 --> 29:12.968
just to destroy everyone
in your path?

29:13.012 --> 29:15.797
- That is who Grodd used to be.

29:15.841 --> 29:19.845
That Grodd wanted power.

29:19.888 --> 29:24.719
Power didn't bring happiness.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.895
It brought pain.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.898
New Grodd wants a new path.

29:33.684 --> 29:39.081
Grodd wants to live...

29:39.125 --> 29:43.912
in peace with his own kind.

29:43.956 --> 29:48.961
Gorilla City is the only place
Grodd ever...

29:49.004 --> 29:53.139
ever felt happy.

29:53.182 --> 29:56.577
- You're telling the truth.

29:56.620 --> 29:59.188
You really have changed.

29:59.232 --> 30:02.452
- Flash didn't believe
Grodd before,

30:02.496 --> 30:06.935
but why does Flash
believe Grodd now?

30:09.982 --> 30:15.030
- You let go of the past.

30:15.074 --> 30:18.947
Maybe I should do the same.

30:18.991 --> 30:24.083
Crisis has changed so much.

30:24.126 --> 30:25.780
I've been obsessed with

30:25.824 --> 30:28.000
trying to keep things
the way they were before,

30:28.043 --> 30:31.960
but I can't.

30:32.004 --> 30:35.268
- Those things don't matter.

30:35.311 --> 30:41.013
If Flash can't beat Solovar,
there's no escape.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.842
This world collapses.
We both die.

30:43.885 --> 30:44.930
That's our fate.

30:44.973 --> 30:48.194
- No.
We decide our fate.

30:48.237 --> 30:51.153
Grodd, Solovar beat me
because I tried to fight him

30:51.197 --> 30:55.331
the exact same way
I fought him three years ago.

30:55.375 --> 30:59.335
To get out of here, we just
have to try something new.

30:59.379 --> 31:02.817
We have to run forward,
not backward.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.601
- How?

31:09.868 --> 31:12.479
- By fighting together.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.314
- There's our way out.

31:25.013 --> 31:28.060
You ready?
We can do this, Grodd.

31:28.103 --> 31:31.933
Together.
- Grodd is ready.

31:48.602 --> 31:49.951
- What is it?
- Barry and Grodd.

31:49.995 --> 31:53.999
Their cerebral activity
is syncing.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.130
Okay, forget "synced."

31:55.174 --> 31:57.002
Their neural pathways
just merged.

31:57.045 --> 32:00.614
Their brainwaves
are literally the same.

32:06.185 --> 32:10.580
- How does it feel?
- It feels impossible.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.539
- I know.
Now get ready.

32:12.582 --> 32:15.585
This time,
we're on the same team.

32:20.242 --> 32:22.984
Grodd will never leave!

32:23.028 --> 32:24.420
- You have my powers, Grodd,

32:24.464 --> 32:26.248
and my knowledge
of how to use them.

32:26.292 --> 32:30.122
Now get us out of here.
- Grodd understands.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.177
- The neural comm link
is working.

32:42.221 --> 32:44.179
- Barry, can you hear me?
- Frost?

32:44.223 --> 32:45.702
- Oh, yes!
We've been trying to get

32:45.746 --> 32:48.270
in contact with you.
You're in Grodd's mind.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.142
Is he trying to hurt you?
- No, no.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.535
We're on the same team.
Grodd and I merged our minds.

32:52.579 --> 32:53.972
Sort of like
the mindscape version

32:54.015 --> 32:55.190
of the Firestorm matrix.

32:55.234 --> 32:56.975
- Wait, so you're
half-gorilla now?

32:57.018 --> 32:58.715
- Uh, I'll explain later.
We're fighting a gatekeeper

32:58.759 --> 33:00.674
in Grodd's mind.
We need to beat it to escape,

33:00.717 --> 33:03.024
and the only way to do that...
- Is by working together.

33:06.071 --> 33:07.550
- There isn't much time.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.291
The world
is gonna split apart.

33:10.510 --> 33:14.253
- Grodd thinks lightning
can save him?

33:14.296 --> 33:15.863
Nothing can save Grodd.

33:15.906 --> 33:18.170
- Uh, Barry, we've got
bigger problems

33:18.213 --> 33:20.563
than Solovar right now.
- I know, Grodd's mindscape

33:20.607 --> 33:22.957
is falling apart.
- Actually, this is worse.

33:27.614 --> 33:29.224
- What can be worse than this?

33:31.531 --> 33:34.534
- According to my scans,
if you exit the mindscape

33:34.577 --> 33:36.492
with your brainwaves
still merged,

33:36.536 --> 33:39.669
you'll end up in one body.

33:39.713 --> 33:42.237
- Brundle-Flash. Gross.
- Yeah.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.717
And what's worse is,

33:43.760 --> 33:45.980
the resulting
physiological conflict

33:46.024 --> 33:49.114
will cause every brain cell
to shut down,

33:49.157 --> 33:52.465
and the resulting form would...
- We'd both die.

33:52.508 --> 33:54.249
- Yeah.
- Wait, so we have to somehow

33:54.293 --> 33:56.251
separate their minds at
the exact moment they escape?

33:56.295 --> 33:58.558
- And I'd have to be accurate
to the millisecond.

33:58.601 --> 34:02.431
Which isn't possible.
- Not for us.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.216
But it's very possible

34:04.259 --> 34:06.653
for a mobile interactive
artificial intelligence unit.

34:06.696 --> 34:08.655
If we sync Gideon's
quantum intelligence network

34:08.698 --> 34:11.005
to Barry and Grodd's
bio-analytics,

34:11.049 --> 34:14.661
it'll perfectly time
the neural de-splicing.

34:14.704 --> 34:18.273
But I'd have to do some more
augmenting to this puppy,

34:18.317 --> 34:21.581
and my augmenting is what got
Barry into this mess,

34:21.624 --> 34:24.453
and I--I just really
don't wanna mess up again, so--

34:24.497 --> 34:26.673
- Chester, listen to me.
That tweak you made

34:26.716 --> 34:28.762
to Gideon earlier?
In two seconds,

34:28.805 --> 34:31.025
you improved her functionality
more than I did in two hours.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.245
You're a genius.
Maybe it didn't work out

34:33.288 --> 34:35.682
exactly how you planned,
so here's round two.

34:35.725 --> 34:36.900
Try again.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.338
I need you now, Chester.
Please.

34:39.381 --> 34:42.993
You can do this.
I believe in you.

34:43.037 --> 34:45.387
- Flash believes in me.
- We all do.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.389
- Go ahead,
take your second chance.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.478
Show us your moves.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.045
- Right.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.134
It's time for the
LeBron James of the Junkyard

34:53.178 --> 34:54.701
to do his thing, baby!

34:54.744 --> 34:56.181
Oh, watch out,
brothers and sisters,

34:56.224 --> 34:59.749
because Chester P. Runk
is b-b-b-back!

34:59.793 --> 35:03.101
- Great. Now all we have to--

35:03.144 --> 35:05.277
- Flash?

35:05.320 --> 35:08.280
- Grodd!

35:08.323 --> 35:10.847
- There is no escape.

35:13.894 --> 35:16.549
- Solovar's winning.
Come on, Barry.

35:16.592 --> 35:19.769
- How's it going, Chester?
- Please let this work.

35:24.644 --> 35:27.603
- Grodd stinks of fear.

35:27.647 --> 35:31.781
Grodd knows Solovar
brings him death.

35:31.825 --> 35:35.045
- Don't listen to him, Grodd.
You have too much to live for.

35:35.089 --> 35:37.396
You hear me?
Don't let the past win.

35:37.439 --> 35:41.704
Put it all behind you and show
Solovar what you're made of.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.621
- That's it.
Now get the hell up

35:45.665 --> 35:50.017
and run, Grodd.
Run!

35:53.890 --> 35:56.197
- Almost there.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.247
- Whatever you guys are doing,
do it now.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.141
- Here goes!

36:32.886 --> 36:34.017
- Yes!

36:38.587 --> 36:42.461
- Come on, Barry.
You got this.

36:42.504 --> 36:46.378
- Oh, thank Rao.

36:46.421 --> 36:50.251
- You're back.
- Yeah, I'm back.

36:50.295 --> 36:53.036
Thanks to the team.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.918
- So do you think Grodd
has gone, like, full hero?

37:04.961 --> 37:06.833
Or is this more of like a--
like a Captain Cold

37:06.876 --> 37:11.098
"former villain turned
sort of good guy" situation?

37:11.141 --> 37:14.449
- Uh, we'll see, I guess.
Lyla had A.R.G.U.S. embed

37:14.493 --> 37:16.408
a tracking polymer
in his cerebellum.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.453
She agreed to let him out
on probation

37:18.497 --> 37:20.150
as long as we know
where he is at all times.

37:20.194 --> 37:24.285
So if he does break bad again,
um, I'll find him.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.156
- Which reminds me,
I'm gonna check in with Lyla

37:26.200 --> 37:28.202
and make sure I understand
A.R.G.U.S.' protocols.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.335
I wanna make sure they give
Grodd a real chance.

37:30.378 --> 37:31.771
- Yeah.

37:31.814 --> 37:34.382
- Hey, babe.
You're kidding.

37:34.426 --> 37:35.427
That's great!
When?

37:35.470 --> 37:37.255
Cisco's coming home!

37:45.306 --> 37:47.482
Hey, um...

37:47.526 --> 37:49.484
I wanted to say, uh,

37:49.528 --> 37:53.227
I'm sorry I wasn't
more welcoming.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.752
It's--I mean, I was dealing
with this family thing.

37:56.796 --> 38:00.365
I felt like everything
in my life was changing,

38:00.408 --> 38:03.150
and I took that out on you,

38:03.193 --> 38:04.543
and I'm sorry.

38:04.586 --> 38:07.720
- Ah, it's--
it's all good, Flash.

38:10.592 --> 38:15.336
Um, by the way,

38:15.380 --> 38:18.252
Kamilla told me
about your parents,

38:18.296 --> 38:21.255
and I kind of...

38:21.299 --> 38:23.213
hacked every cemetery database

38:23.257 --> 38:26.042
within a 700-mile radius.

38:31.439 --> 38:32.614
Found them.

38:36.531 --> 38:40.318
- I don't remem...

38:45.453 --> 38:47.107
Thank you, Chester.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.418
- Do you mind
manning the comms?

38:56.377 --> 38:58.727
I thought you'd never ask.

38:58.771 --> 39:01.164
According to our satellites,

39:01.208 --> 39:03.732
it is...Rathaway.

39:03.776 --> 39:06.822
Pied Piper's back, baby!

39:06.866 --> 39:08.607
- Okay, I'm gonna need
all the help I can get

39:08.650 --> 39:10.173
to take him down.
Are you ready?

39:10.217 --> 39:11.523
- Oh, hell, yeah.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.742
- All right.

39:13.786 --> 39:18.443
- Oh, that's
never gonna get old.

39:18.486 --> 39:22.272
- Eva, I'm so sorry.

39:22.316 --> 39:23.491
Why didn't you tell me

39:23.535 --> 39:25.058
that the machine
could hurt you?

39:25.101 --> 39:27.539
- I wanted to prove
I wasn't lying.

39:27.582 --> 39:29.584
Words are worthless.

39:29.628 --> 39:33.632
Evidence--
evidence is irrefutable.

39:33.675 --> 39:37.810
My colleagues ridiculed
my reflective theory.

39:37.853 --> 39:40.203
Even though my research
was bleeding edge,

39:40.247 --> 39:42.031
no scientific journal
would publish it,

39:42.075 --> 39:44.425
because I hadn't shown it
to be true.

39:44.469 --> 39:46.906
I just...

39:46.949 --> 39:48.473
I couldn't have you doubt me
like that.

39:48.516 --> 39:50.997
I just...

39:51.040 --> 39:52.520
I just needed you
to believe me.

39:52.564 --> 39:55.654
- Eva, of course I believe you.

39:55.697 --> 39:57.569
I saw you move
those mirror pieces.

39:57.612 --> 40:00.833
You're capable of great things.

40:00.876 --> 40:05.272
Look, when you're feeling
better, we will...

40:05.315 --> 40:07.143
We'll find another way.

40:07.187 --> 40:10.843
- Yeah.

40:10.886 --> 40:14.194
I think I have
some more, uh, bandages

40:14.237 --> 40:15.500
in the storage room.

40:15.543 --> 40:18.503
Would you get them?
- Yeah, of course.

40:35.737 --> 40:37.522
- What did you do to us?

40:37.565 --> 40:39.480
- I bought us time.

40:39.524 --> 40:43.136
There's no need for you
to suffer.

41:20.608 --> 41:25.570
- All right.
Easy-peasy.

41:34.579 --> 41:38.539
- He...is...

41:38.583 --> 41:41.411
Coming...

42:08.787 --> 42:10.049
- Greg, move your head.
