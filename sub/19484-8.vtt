00:12.137 --> 00:15.223
[Ilse] <i>Some people think</i>
<i>interior design is a look.</i>

00:15.849 --> 00:18.268
In fact, "It must be
really fun buying furniture"

00:18.351 --> 00:20.603
is something one person
said to me once.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.606
<i>But I see it differently.</i>

00:25.191 --> 00:28.278
<i>We spend 87% of our lives</i>
<i>inside buildings.</i>

00:29.070 --> 00:34.993
<i>How they are designed really affects</i>
<i>how we feel, how we behave.</i>

00:38.246 --> 00:40.457
<i>Design is not just a visual thing.</i>

00:42.459 --> 00:43.877
<i>It's a thought process.</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:45.628
<i>It's a skill.</i>

00:48.590 --> 00:53.762
<i>Ultimately, design is a tool</i>
<i>to enhance our humanity.</i>

00:57.265 --> 00:58.725
<i>It's a frame for life.</i>

01:00.977 --> 01:03.063
[lively piano music playing]

02:01.121 --> 02:02.789
[gentle studio chatter]

02:06.584 --> 02:09.003
[colleague] It's still got
a really strong design quality.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.548
I just added a note.
That's a stone floor...

02:11.631 --> 02:13.967
[Ilse] <i>All our projects start</i>
<i>with a strategy.</i>

02:15.093 --> 02:16.928
<i>Basically prioritizing people,</i>

02:17.011 --> 02:20.723
<i>putting the human experience</i>
<i>at the beginning of the design process.</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:27.272
Each of these chairs has met many
of these criteria.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.109
I think we should
narrow it down to two.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.571
Michael, what are the pluses
and minuses of this chair?

02:35.196 --> 02:37.574
[Michael] The materials are great.
We really like it.

02:38.199 --> 02:43.413
-It's got real tactile memory, actually.
-Yeah, and it's quite easy to handle.

02:44.497 --> 02:48.877
[Ilse] <i>In our process,</i>
<i>we interrogate the place, the client,</i>

02:49.586 --> 02:51.754
<i>and then empathize...</i>

02:51.838 --> 02:54.424
<i>because empathy is a cornerstone</i>
<i>of design.</i>

02:57.510 --> 02:59.053
[Michael] It's great. The form.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.513
[Ilse] Yeah, it's a good chair.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.266
-Quite a challenge, isn't it?
-[colleague] Yeah.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.685
[Ilse] You want to feel easy and relaxed,

03:05.768 --> 03:07.645
so I think it does come down to these two.

03:08.438 --> 03:12.025
<i>And then from that process</i>
<i>of interrogation and empathy,</i>

03:12.650 --> 03:15.194
<i>that's when</i>
<i>the imaginative process kicks in.</i>

03:17.196 --> 03:19.198
<i>Interiors, which for ages</i>
<i>have been treated</i>

03:19.282 --> 03:22.493
<i>as being</i>
<i>a slightly sillier side to design,</i>

03:22.994 --> 03:25.038
<i>is now beginning to be taken seriously.</i>

03:33.254 --> 03:36.049
[TV reporter] <i>Glancing at</i>
<i>the artistic lines of this modern home,</i>

03:36.633 --> 03:41.721
<i>we forget the old idea that houses should</i>
<i>follow past and out-of-date fashions.</i>

03:44.933 --> 03:48.478
Traditionally, interior design has been
a predominantly visual medium,

03:48.561 --> 03:50.897
it's been rather frothy and flamboyant.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.608
<i>It's all about showmanship</i>
<i>and theatricality.</i>

04:02.200 --> 04:06.120
Ilse's approach is much more subtle,
it's much more sensual.

04:06.204 --> 04:10.917
It's about how things feel and smell
as much as how things look.

04:13.002 --> 04:17.131
<i>She wants to imbue people</i>
<i>with a sense of wellbeing, empowerment</i>

04:17.215 --> 04:19.300
and sort of gentle joyfulness.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.981
By many people, Ilse's seen
as something of an icon... [chuckles]

04:34.607 --> 04:39.404
<i>because she has developed</i>
<i>a whole new way of looking at interiors.</i>

04:41.739 --> 04:44.409
One of the qualities
that distinguishes her work

04:44.492 --> 04:46.452
from that of other interior designers

04:46.536 --> 04:48.830
<i>is that it's about</i>
<i>how we experience a room</i>

04:48.913 --> 04:52.208
<i>and how we ourselves feel in a room</i>

04:52.834 --> 04:55.211
<i>to satisfy the subconscious.</i>

04:58.965 --> 05:02.135
Ilse's strength is her humanity
and her caring.

05:02.218 --> 05:05.096
She really cares about wellbeing.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.599
<i>Everything that surrounds us</i>
<i>is really done with this care,</i>

05:08.683 --> 05:12.270
<i>with this love that makes you</i>
<i>kind of feel good.</i>

05:13.980 --> 05:15.356
And not just look good, too.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.987
[Ilse] <i>I am a very self-motivated person.</i>

05:21.529 --> 05:23.823
I actually had always worked.

05:23.906 --> 05:27.535
I mean, literally, I started working
on the side when I was 13

05:27.618 --> 05:30.288
<i>because I've never wanted</i>
<i>to ask for money.</i>

05:30.371 --> 05:32.540
<i>I've always wanted to be independent.</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:39.047
<i>I worked at Pitts Cottage as a waitress,</i>
<i>I'm sure completely illegally,</i>

05:39.130 --> 05:42.759
serving coffees and shortbread biscuits
which had a cherry in the middle

05:42.842 --> 05:45.428
and looked like a breast. [chuckles]

05:45.511 --> 05:46.763
I remember it so clearly.

05:50.224 --> 05:55.438
<i>From a kid, I was interested in how people</i>
<i>behave differently in different spaces.</i>

05:55.521 --> 05:56.773
<i>That fascinated me.</i>

05:59.108 --> 06:03.112
<i>So when I went to university, I studied</i>
<i>history and history of architecture.</i>

06:04.781 --> 06:07.533
<i>After university, I was the studio manager</i>
<i>for an architect,</i>

06:08.576 --> 06:11.496
<i>and from there, was hired</i>
<i>to work on the editorial team</i>

06:11.579 --> 06:13.998
of an architect's magazine,
because I knew my stuff.

06:16.542 --> 06:22.131
<i>So when I was asked to start </i>Elle Deco,
<i>it was a no-brainer</i>

06:22.215 --> 06:25.593
because I really wanted
to do a contemporary magazine

06:26.094 --> 06:28.596
that was warmer
and reached a bigger audience.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.851
[Rawsthorn] <i>Ilse has always treated</i>
<i>interior design,</i>

06:33.935 --> 06:37.688
<i>both as a designer</i>
<i>and magazine editor originally,</i>

06:37.772 --> 06:42.443
with a seriousness and a complexity
that was arguably lacking before.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.697
[Ilse] <i>Editing a magazine</i>
<i>is really about having</i>

06:46.781 --> 06:48.658
<i>a very close connection to your audience</i>

06:48.741 --> 06:54.372
<i>and knowing how to reach them,</i>
<i>how to excite them, how to inspire them.</i>

06:54.455 --> 06:57.667
<i>It's a conversation, essentially,</i>
<i>that you have with your reader.</i>

06:58.835 --> 07:01.212
<i>We presented these livable spaces.</i>

07:02.547 --> 07:07.009
<i>The journey of the scene,</i>
<i>4,000, 5,000 different interiors,</i>

07:08.010 --> 07:10.304
<i>seeing how people really use space.</i>

07:10.888 --> 07:14.392
<i>Which spaces really worked,</i>
<i>which spaces really touched our audience.</i>

07:16.727 --> 07:19.105
<i>I mean, that was really</i>
<i>my design education.</i>

07:20.022 --> 07:23.359
But I wanted to do my own thing,
I wanted to make things,

07:23.443 --> 07:28.156
I wanted to get my hands dirty
and really do something for myself.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.168
<i>I'm driven by my curiosities.</i>

07:41.377 --> 07:46.257
<i>By learning more about what made</i>
<i>people comfortable in space,</i>

07:46.340 --> 07:51.220
<i>researching in Anthropology,</i>
<i>Behavioral Science and so on,</i>

07:51.888 --> 07:56.309
<i>that really made me understand</i>
<i>how we discover the world.</i>

07:58.853 --> 08:00.771
<i>I wrote a book called </i>Sensual Home.

08:02.648 --> 08:08.070
<i>In that book, I went through the senses</i>
<i>because it seemed to me fascinating.</i>

08:08.154 --> 08:10.698
<i>That is, after all,</i>
<i>how we experience the world.</i>

08:12.575 --> 08:13.951
<i>We are our bodies.</i>

08:17.121 --> 08:19.832
<i>Writing </i>Sensual Home
<i>was the aha moment,</i>

08:20.333 --> 08:24.212
<i>because it wasn't</i>
<i>the current understanding of design.</i>

08:27.006 --> 08:31.385
<i>So I knew that my days</i>
<i>as a two-dimensional person were over</i>

08:31.469 --> 08:33.262
<i>and I really wanted to move into three</i>

08:33.346 --> 08:36.474
<i>and figure out</i>
<i>whether I could work in that field.</i>

08:37.266 --> 08:38.559
[piano music playing]

08:41.854 --> 08:45.358
My first project was
immediately after I left <i>Elle Decoration,</i>

08:45.441 --> 08:49.570
when Nick Jones from Soho House
asked me to help him with Babington House.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.615
<i>His first hotel out in the countryside.</i>

08:53.950 --> 08:57.787
<i>I had no practical experience</i>
<i>at that point,</i>

08:57.870 --> 09:00.665
so it was pretty adventurous of him
to ask me.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.169
<i>Nick started on a path</i>
<i>of it being rather traditional.</i>

09:05.836 --> 09:08.798
<i>It's in the country, so it was going to be</i>
<i>a country house hotel.</i>

09:09.799 --> 09:12.927
I was very clear that
that was the last thing it should be.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.973
<i>It was for the media and advertising</i>
<i>and film crowd,</i>

09:17.056 --> 09:21.227
<i>so my proposal said it should be</i>
<i>this very informal place</i>

09:21.310 --> 09:23.980
<i>that you could just treat</i>
<i>as if it was your own.</i>

09:24.647 --> 09:26.899
<i>Like a family house of a friend</i>

09:26.983 --> 09:28.609
where the parents have gone away
for the weekend

09:28.693 --> 09:30.027
and left the keys to the drinks cabinet.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.864
<i>And now, that doesn't seem so radical,</i>

09:33.948 --> 09:36.742
<i>but really then,</i>
<i>it was the first of a kind.</i>

09:38.244 --> 09:41.581
<i>And then Nick asked me to do</i>
<i>the next Soho House in New York.</i>

09:44.709 --> 09:46.752
<i>And that's really where the studio began</i>

09:46.836 --> 09:48.754
<i>because that's when</i>
<i>I brought people in to help me,</i>

09:48.838 --> 09:50.715
<i>and it grew from there.</i>

09:52.258 --> 09:55.636
<i>And it has been</i>
<i>one project after another since then.</i>

10:02.101 --> 10:04.645
<i>Cecconi's was an old,</i>
<i>failing Italian restaurant</i>

10:04.729 --> 10:06.230
<i>in the center of London.</i>

10:06.939 --> 10:07.982
<i>We looked at making it</i>

10:08.065 --> 10:12.612
<i>something that had the character</i>
<i>of the grand Italian station bar.</i>

10:13.279 --> 10:16.032
<i>Those wonderful, democratic,</i>
<i>beautiful spaces,</i>

10:16.115 --> 10:20.244
<i>that was very much like a stage</i>
<i>for the staff that work there.</i>

10:21.037 --> 10:25.833
<i>And an interior made with materials all</i>
<i>from the region around Venice.</i>

10:27.835 --> 10:32.798
<i>High Road House, Chiswick, was about</i>
<i>making this great public space downstairs,</i>

10:34.175 --> 10:37.178
<i>and then rooms</i>
<i>that reflected the simplicity</i>

10:37.261 --> 10:39.722
<i>of the arts and crafts houses</i>
<i>that were all around it.</i>

10:40.389 --> 10:42.308
<i>We did The Olde Bell,</i>

10:42.391 --> 10:45.061
<i>a really quite smelly pub</i>
<i>when we first saw it.</i>

10:45.603 --> 10:48.689
<i>We were asked to define</i>
<i>what an English coaching inn would be,</i>

10:49.982 --> 10:51.859
<i>translating that into furniture,</i>

10:53.486 --> 10:54.570
<i>materials,</i>

10:55.363 --> 10:56.489
<i>food,</i>

10:58.366 --> 10:59.492
<i>uniforms.</i>

11:00.117 --> 11:03.621
<i>We also worked with Mathias Dahlgren</i>
<i>in Stockholm</i>

11:03.704 --> 11:05.665
<i>to develop two restaurants</i>

11:05.748 --> 11:08.501
<i>which would be</i>
<i>the physical manifestation</i>

11:08.584 --> 11:11.754
<i>of his love and philosophy</i>
<i>of Swedish gastronomy.</i>

11:17.426 --> 11:20.304
<i>We did the first Aesop in the UK.</i>

11:21.430 --> 11:24.517
<i>The owner said the thing about skin care</i>
<i>that made the difference</i>

11:24.600 --> 11:27.186
<i>was not just what was in the product,</i>

11:27.269 --> 11:29.355
<i>but the ritual of daily maintenance.</i>

11:29.438 --> 11:31.982
<i>So we put the sink</i>
<i>in the middle of the store.</i>

11:33.901 --> 11:37.655
<i>The notion of taking care of yourself</i>
<i>elevated through design.</i>

11:42.743 --> 11:47.164
<i>What we're really interested in</i>
<i>is translating the client,</i>

11:49.125 --> 11:50.793
<i>the future life of a building,</i>

11:50.876 --> 11:52.753
<i>into a design language.</i>

11:56.674 --> 11:58.551
<i>So quite a range.</i>

11:59.135 --> 12:02.888
<i>What was really exciting was to figure out</i>
<i>if our approach worked</i>

12:02.972 --> 12:05.808
<i>for very different people</i>
<i>in very different places.</i>

12:08.144 --> 12:11.230
<i>We managed to create</i>
<i>these special identities.</i>

12:11.313 --> 12:14.942
<i>I mean, people said that,</i>
<i>while they didn't look the same,</i>

12:15.025 --> 12:16.402
<i>they did have a similar feeling.</i>

12:18.320 --> 12:22.283
<i>By creating places that really affect</i>
<i>people through five senses,</i>

12:22.366 --> 12:26.120
<i>they had a real connection</i>
<i>that was very unusual at the time.</i>

12:38.507 --> 12:42.052
<i>While I know what works for me visually,</i>

12:42.136 --> 12:47.391
I need to make sense of it
through writing

12:48.767 --> 12:51.770
in order to then do what I do.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.398
I need both hands to speak to each other.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.487
<i>So the second book</i>
<i>was trying to figure out</i>

12:59.570 --> 13:05.242
<i>how to structure my design thoughts</i>
<i>into actually a design manifesto.</i>

13:07.453 --> 13:09.580
[Thompson]
<i>Ilse makes things easy to comprehend</i>

13:09.663 --> 13:12.500
<i>'cause she's broken them down</i>
<i>into very basic ideas.</i>

13:13.792 --> 13:17.254
Twenty-plus years ago,
Ilse had very new ideas,

13:17.338 --> 13:22.009
and I think it takes a long time for a new
idea to really become an established idea,

13:22.092 --> 13:24.261
and so it's been a process.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.808
[Ilse] <i>I grew up</i>
<i>in a pretty progressive family.</i>

13:30.851 --> 13:33.521
<i>Both my parents were</i>
<i>extremely free thinking.</i>

13:34.730 --> 13:36.899
<i>My mother was a trained artist</i>

13:39.360 --> 13:42.154
<i>and my father was an investigative</i>
<i>journalist for </i>The Sunday Times

13:42.238 --> 13:43.239
<i>and an economist.</i>

13:44.073 --> 13:48.911
My father was very demanding academically.
I learnt how to prove myself very young.

13:49.995 --> 13:54.708
<i>Because he was of the mind that humans</i>
<i>don't question or interrogate reality</i>

13:54.792 --> 13:55.918
<i>before they have an opinion.</i>

13:56.418 --> 13:58.087
If you interrogate a situation,

13:58.170 --> 14:00.256
actually, the answers
present themselves to you.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.343
<i>And my mother was adventurous.</i>

14:05.886 --> 14:08.847
<i>She gave us total freedom really,</i>
<i>with our own environment</i>

14:08.931 --> 14:10.599
<i>to express ourselves.</i>

14:12.184 --> 14:15.396
But when I was a teenager,
my mother got quite sick.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.399
<i>She was in her mid-30s.</i>

14:18.941 --> 14:23.195
<i>I spent quite a lot of time going in</i>
<i>and out of hospitals to hang out with her.</i>

14:24.405 --> 14:27.950
<i>Those great long corridors</i>
<i>reduced people to patients,</i>

14:28.033 --> 14:31.161
<i>waiting for the doctor in the white coat</i>
<i>to march up and down.</i>

14:32.288 --> 14:33.873
<i>They were really inhuman.</i>

14:34.790 --> 14:40.170
<i>To see that a building could have</i>
<i>such an impact on the way people felt,</i>

14:40.254 --> 14:41.797
<i>on the way they interacted.</i>

14:42.381 --> 14:48.304
It was a real revelation
that human values are non-negotiable.

14:51.640 --> 14:56.729
<i>That combination</i>
<i>of interrogation and empathy</i>

14:56.812 --> 14:59.565
<i>is something that's been with me</i>
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

15:07.072 --> 15:12.828
<i>When we first approach a project,</i>
<i>we always hold off what our opinion is.</i>

15:12.912 --> 15:16.373
<i>So we ask questions. We watch a lot.</i>

15:17.541 --> 15:18.375
<i>We listen.</i>

15:18.459 --> 15:23.005
I always say to my team we've got
two eyes, two ears and one mouth

15:23.088 --> 15:25.382
and we should use them
in that proportion.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.551
[general project chatter]

15:30.846 --> 15:34.350
[Ilse] <i>Through that process</i>
<i>of interrogation and empathy,</i>

15:34.850 --> 15:38.020
<i>we can understand</i>
<i>really what it is we're looking at.</i>

15:41.065 --> 15:42.650
<i>Our expertise in terms of process</i>

15:42.733 --> 15:45.736
<i>was relevant when it came to</i>
<i>working on a project like with IKEA.</i>

15:47.279 --> 15:50.491
<i>They noticed the humanity of our approach,</i>

15:50.574 --> 15:54.578
<i>and that's something that is embedded</i>
<i>in their ideology as a company.</i>

15:56.622 --> 16:01.293
They're very interested
in how we can bring those human values

16:01.377 --> 16:02.962
into their restaurants.

16:03.420 --> 16:06.590
This has to be a very robust vision

16:06.674 --> 16:09.677
because it's going to be
translated round the world.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.178
[colleague] It's a huge thing.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.806
The restaurant is always done
as an afterthought.

16:13.889 --> 16:15.724
The store is the mammoth thing
to get right.

16:15.808 --> 16:16.642
Yeah.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.103
And, like we talk about,
the end of the system,

16:19.186 --> 16:21.647
that's the bit that gets
the last bits of the money

16:21.730 --> 16:23.107
and the last bits of the time.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.527
So it would be quite interesting
to reverse that process.

16:27.027 --> 16:31.657
I didn't know it was called a restaurant.
I just thought that's really interesting.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.118
-[Ilse] It's a cafeteria.
-[colleague] Yeah.

16:34.493 --> 16:39.540
They can use that space to encourage
and give sort of behavioral cues to people

16:39.623 --> 16:42.001
to eat more healthily, especially kids.

16:43.002 --> 16:47.548
Although it sounds like the hot dog
is something that will be hung on to.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.966
Maybe that's okay.

16:49.049 --> 16:53.929
It just needs to be sort of framed
in a different language, not advertised...

16:54.763 --> 16:57.474
[Ilse] But apparently the veggie ball
is doing brilliantly.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.101
[colleague] Is it really? That's great.

16:59.685 --> 17:02.021
[colleague] The next steps
will be to go and do

17:02.104 --> 17:04.940
some very rigorous observation in IKEA

17:05.024 --> 17:06.483
in the existing environments.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.656
[Ilse] <i>Changes on this scale</i>
<i>could make a massive impact.</i>

17:25.919 --> 17:29.715
<i>Almost every client finds this room</i>
<i>their favorite space.</i>

17:31.133 --> 17:36.013
<i>Each project has its specific</i>
<i>material language that we might use</i>

17:36.096 --> 17:40.142
<i>in terms of how they're laid,</i>
<i>how they're finished.</i>

17:40.225 --> 17:42.436
<i>Materials are the thing</i>
<i>that tell the truth.</i>

17:43.771 --> 17:46.523
<i>It's something that</i>
<i>we go into in great detail.</i>

17:48.358 --> 17:50.360
<i>Humans naturally are drawn to materials.</i>

17:52.863 --> 17:55.115
<i>We discover the world through our senses.</i>

17:56.533 --> 17:59.995
<i>What we're interested in</i>
<i>is how materials speak to us.</i>

18:00.579 --> 18:04.374
<i>The things that touch the skin,</i>
<i>the things that really give you memory.</i>

18:05.459 --> 18:07.419
<i>We focus a lot on that.</i>

18:10.464 --> 18:12.424
<i>Materials are</i>
<i>much more compelling and convincing</i>

18:12.508 --> 18:13.717
<i>once you see them in context,</i>

18:13.801 --> 18:17.513
or at least in the character of light
that will hit it,

18:17.596 --> 18:21.475
and ideally in association with
the other materials that will be with it.

18:30.526 --> 18:35.614
<i>Really, it's that combination of materials</i>
<i>that speak to each other</i>

18:35.697 --> 18:42.121
<i>and create this tactile, warm</i>
<i>and very physical environment.</i>

18:43.539 --> 18:48.710
<i>So for example, when we were working</i>
<i>on Cathay Pacific Airport lounges,</i>

18:48.794 --> 18:54.091
<i>you really need to choose materials</i>
<i>that are functional, but yet luxurious.</i>

18:55.467 --> 18:58.220
<i>Now, these are people who are tired,</i>
<i>who are probably jet-lagged,</i>

18:58.303 --> 19:00.514
<i>and a lounge is a place</i>
<i>to make them feel human.</i>

19:02.432 --> 19:07.020
<i>Typically, an airport lounge will often</i>
<i>line chairs up rather institutionally,</i>

19:07.104 --> 19:08.522
<i>and we didn't want to do that.</i>

19:08.605 --> 19:12.860
<i>We wanted it to have the sense of</i>
<i>domestic space, but yet function well.</i>

19:13.485 --> 19:14.736
<i>That was a challenge.</i>

19:15.529 --> 19:17.990
<i>The lounge needed to have</i>
<i>minimal maintenance,</i>

19:18.073 --> 19:21.702
<i>to be somewhere that could withstand</i>
<i>many, many people per day</i>

19:22.202 --> 19:24.997
<i>going through with wheelie suitcases</i>
<i>which bash the walls.</i>

19:25.080 --> 19:27.082
<i>So paint, for example, was a no go.</i>

19:28.500 --> 19:32.796
It needed to be materialized
in a way that expressed Cathay

19:32.880 --> 19:35.048
and not, for example, another airline.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.260
So when it came to choosing materials
for the first-class lounge,

19:38.343 --> 19:41.138
in the hallway, we chose onyx.

19:42.139 --> 19:46.018
<i>It's a natural material,</i>
<i>it's from the area, it's an Asian material</i>

19:47.186 --> 19:49.062
<i>and because it's robust.</i>

19:49.813 --> 19:51.648
<i>It's not the cheapest material</i>
<i>you could find,</i>

19:51.732 --> 19:55.485
so we needed to balance it with something
more down-to-earth that offset it.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.237
So we chose a limestone.

19:59.489 --> 20:00.866
<i>But then we needed to add warmth.</i>

20:02.492 --> 20:05.621
We actually understand materials best
by contrast.

20:05.704 --> 20:09.958
Our senses are wired in such a way

20:10.042 --> 20:14.046
<i>that we understand that rough</i>
<i>feels rougher by contrast with smooth.</i>

20:15.923 --> 20:19.509
To get the best out of these materials,
we needed to find its opposite.

20:20.010 --> 20:24.556
So mohair velvet,
which is a very robust velvet,

20:24.640 --> 20:28.769
which is totally durable
but feels luxurious.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.480
<i>So offsetting the hardness,</i>

20:31.563 --> 20:34.358
<i>the coolness of the onyx</i>
<i>and the limestone.</i>

20:35.025 --> 20:39.112
Then bringing in something natural,
both in finish and also form.

20:39.821 --> 20:44.576
And then to bring in the touch of lux,
it had a brass base.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.789
<i>So it was less about the aesthetics</i>
<i>or the appearance,</i>

20:48.872 --> 20:51.124
<i>although that's obviously in the mix,</i>

20:51.208 --> 20:54.753
<i>but much more about</i>
<i>how to make an environment</i>

20:54.836 --> 21:00.050
<i>that made people feel better after</i>
<i>they'd been there than when they arrived.</i>

21:00.801 --> 21:03.095
<i>It's all about wellbeing.</i>

21:03.720 --> 21:05.889
<i>That means that</i>
<i>when people walk into it,</i>

21:06.473 --> 21:08.934
they don't know why they feel
the way they feel,

21:09.768 --> 21:12.396
but it's actually all been orchestrated.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.362
[general studio chatter]

21:20.946 --> 21:22.906
[colleague] I don't know
if that's enough...

21:25.701 --> 21:28.912
[Ilse] <i>The execution of our projects</i>
<i>comes down to the tools.</i>

21:31.039 --> 21:35.335
<i>Tangible tools,</i>
<i>such as materials, sketching,</i>

21:36.795 --> 21:40.841
<i>and all the technical tools,</i>
<i>CAD, Vectorworks, etc.</i>

21:41.675 --> 21:45.470
<i>And the ultimate measurable tool,</i>
<i>the tape measure.</i>

21:45.554 --> 21:48.015
<i>A blissfully simple, essential tool.</i>

21:50.642 --> 21:53.562
<i>Dimensions, for us as a studio,</i>
<i>are super important.</i>

21:54.021 --> 21:56.440
<i>When we're making furniture, for example,</i>

21:56.523 --> 22:01.028
<i>three inches is a massive difference</i>
<i>as to whether something is comfortable</i>

22:01.111 --> 22:04.406
<i>or whether it's the right dimension</i>
<i>to have a conversation.</i>

22:05.574 --> 22:09.911
<i>I prefer a table where the dimensions</i>
<i>enhance conversation,</i>

22:09.995 --> 22:11.455
<i>where you're closer together.</i>

22:12.039 --> 22:13.373
<i>What's interesting about tables</i>

22:13.457 --> 22:17.502
<i>is that they can be metaphors</i>
<i>of power and confrontation.</i>

22:17.586 --> 22:20.464
<i>The conference table</i>
<i>is typically wide and long,</i>

22:20.547 --> 22:23.675
<i>and the one at the top</i>
<i>is the one who pulls all the strings.</i>

22:24.593 --> 22:28.430
<i>The informal table, for me,</i>
<i>is a more lovely thing.</i>

22:29.431 --> 22:31.558
<i>The Together Table</i>
<i>is a really good example.</i>

22:31.641 --> 22:35.937
<i>It's actually narrow enough</i>
<i>to have a conversation quite comfortably,</i>

22:36.021 --> 22:37.105
<i>75 centimeters,</i>

22:38.023 --> 22:39.066
<i>and then the oval...</i>

22:39.608 --> 22:43.070
<i>An oval does give you the possibility</i>
<i>to squeeze more people in.</i>

22:45.572 --> 22:50.160
<i>Design that encourages people</i>
<i>to be close together is a good thing.</i>

22:52.454 --> 22:53.914
[general chatter]

22:54.498 --> 22:56.833
<i>I didn't initially see product</i>

22:56.917 --> 22:59.961
<i>as being something</i>
<i>that we either could or should do.</i>

23:00.045 --> 23:03.006
But when we were designing
some interiors,

23:03.090 --> 23:06.802
we needed to do
specific products for those interiors,

23:06.885 --> 23:08.428
because we couldn't find them.

23:09.971 --> 23:13.767
<i>The Brass Cabinet was an original piece</i>
<i>that we did for the Aesop store.</i>

23:14.476 --> 23:17.813
<i>And we evolved the design</i>
<i>for other clients.</i>

23:19.439 --> 23:22.818
<i>To make a good product</i>
<i>is so much more complicated</i>

23:22.901 --> 23:25.195
<i>than just throwing a sketch over a wall</i>

23:25.278 --> 23:27.989
<i>or a CAD drawing to a manufacturer.</i>

23:28.657 --> 23:31.493
<i>Design is a relationship with the maker.</i>

23:35.288 --> 23:39.167
<i>The best results are always</i>
<i>about the collaboration.</i>

23:40.836 --> 23:44.464
<i>You really need to sample it</i>
<i>and refine a product.</i>

23:46.508 --> 23:50.720
<i>It takes many iterations,</i>
<i>so that ultimately it can live on its own.</i>

23:55.559 --> 23:58.979
<i>So for example, when we were designing</i>
<i>the Sinnerlig range for IKEA,</i>

23:59.062 --> 24:00.480
<i>it was very important to us</i>

24:00.564 --> 24:03.984
<i>that we make furniture</i>
<i>that could reach the whole world.</i>

24:06.027 --> 24:07.320
The project for IKEA,

24:07.904 --> 24:09.865
trying to understand
what is mass manufacturing

24:09.948 --> 24:14.119
and instead of maybe saying,
"Oh, this is horrible."

24:14.202 --> 24:16.079
It's questioning
and trying to understand

24:16.163 --> 24:19.499
that mass manufacturing
can give us a great benefit,

24:19.583 --> 24:23.712
because it can give us access
to things for everyone.

24:25.463 --> 24:29.259
[Ilse] <i>For many people, IKEA is a big,</i>
<i>bad cheap furniture warehouse.</i>

24:30.552 --> 24:32.512
<i>But actually, what's really interesting</i>

24:32.596 --> 24:38.435
<i>is strategically what is in that system</i>
<i>that can be used positively,</i>

24:38.935 --> 24:41.396
<i>using design to make things better.</i>

24:44.399 --> 24:49.362
<i>The basis of our relationship was to bring</i>
<i>emotional values into that system</i>

24:49.446 --> 24:53.492
<i>and come out with products</i>
<i>that are sustainable,</i>

24:53.825 --> 24:55.410
<i>but people really love.</i>

24:56.828 --> 24:59.623
What we wanted to do
was not just product development.

24:59.706 --> 25:02.500
We wanted a development of an experience,

25:02.584 --> 25:07.339
<i>and since StudioIlse is working with</i>
<i>both products and interior design,</i>

25:07.422 --> 25:08.840
<i>that's like a perfect fit.</i>

25:10.008 --> 25:14.137
This is actually one year
from when they started, still here.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.263
It's kind of nice.

25:16.973 --> 25:18.683
[Ilse] It's great to see it in the store.

25:20.352 --> 25:25.023
<i>Looking at materials that we could</i>
<i>work with, we came to love cork.</i>

25:26.066 --> 25:31.696
<i>Because it's very abundant,</i>
<i>utterly sustainable, there's no waste.</i>

25:32.572 --> 25:36.910
<i>It goes from being the bark,</i>
<i>harvested in the very old way</i>

25:36.993 --> 25:40.914
<i>with skilled craftsmen who know</i>
<i>how to do it without damaging the trees.</i>

25:41.623 --> 25:43.875
<i>In order to get that tactility,</i>

25:43.959 --> 25:46.920
<i>we had to work very hard</i>
<i>to find a new coating.</i>

25:48.421 --> 25:50.924
<i>Design thrives on restrictions, actually.</i>

25:51.007 --> 25:54.844
<i>I think of it as a primal drive,</i>
<i>that you need those tight restrictions</i>

25:54.928 --> 25:56.972
<i>and then, somehow or other,</i>
<i>you come out of it.</i>

25:58.515 --> 26:03.103
<i>We looked at the process</i>
<i>of making ceramics in Vietnam</i>

26:03.186 --> 26:07.566
<i>and saw that a way of creating</i>
<i>imperfection and difference</i>

26:07.649 --> 26:09.067
<i>was staring us straight in the face,</i>

26:09.150 --> 26:11.152
<i>which is that the jars are dip dyed.</i>

26:11.820 --> 26:14.406
<i>What you got was</i>
<i>there's never one the same.</i>

26:15.949 --> 26:17.867
<i>The process was nearly three years.</i>

26:18.368 --> 26:22.205
People don't realize, I think,
how long it really takes to make something

26:22.289 --> 26:25.959
that comes out at this price
in these quantities.

26:26.793 --> 26:30.380
Bringing together good design
on this scale is just, for us,

26:30.964 --> 26:33.508
a really, really interesting end result.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.845
Now, we're taking the next step,
into the restaurant,

26:36.928 --> 26:39.097
bringing those learnings
into what we could do

26:39.180 --> 26:40.640
to the restaurant business of IKEA...

26:40.724 --> 26:41.599
[Ilse] Yeah.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.101
[Engman] and that's going to be fun.

27:03.538 --> 27:08.752
[Ilse] <i>I grew up in a part of London</i>
<i>that was filled with derelict houses,</i>

27:09.461 --> 27:13.256
<i>which were being smashed down,</i>
<i>but had beautiful 19th-century tiles.</i>

27:14.090 --> 27:17.218
<i>There was no understanding</i>
<i>of the beauty of these things.</i>

27:17.302 --> 27:21.139
<i>My mother and I used to go out at night</i>
<i>with hammer and chisel and rescue them,</i>

27:21.222 --> 27:24.601
<i>so they wouldn't be smashed</i>
<i>by the wrecking ball the next day.</i>

27:26.811 --> 27:31.107
<i>I've always, since a child,</i>
<i>been fascinated by the atmosphere.</i>

27:31.941 --> 27:36.029
<i>And I still am. I think that houses</i>
<i>carry the atmosphere of their past.</i>

27:38.948 --> 27:41.951
<i>Being a designer,</i>
<i>in some way, gives you X-ray eyes</i>

27:42.035 --> 27:45.455
<i>and you're able to see through</i>
<i>the current iteration of a building</i>

27:45.538 --> 27:48.583
<i>and how you can build on that.</i>

28:01.721 --> 28:04.724
<i>Working on </i>Ett Hem<i> was</i>
<i>a four-and-a-half year conversation</i>

28:04.808 --> 28:09.562
<i>because it had quite a tricky time going</i>
<i>through planning and historic permission.</i>

28:10.939 --> 28:14.192
Before collaborating with Ilse,
I had googled her

28:14.275 --> 28:19.197
and understood, you know,
"Wow, she's a rock star." [chuckles]

28:19.864 --> 28:22.492
<i>We spent eight months together.</i>

28:22.575 --> 28:24.536
<i>They really took the time</i>
<i>to get to know me,</i>

28:24.619 --> 28:28.832
<i>showing them, you know, houses</i>
<i>and places I liked here in Scandinavia,</i>

28:28.915 --> 28:31.626
<i>pointing out the important things in life.</i>

28:32.252 --> 28:33.920
<i>Values, food...</i>

28:34.587 --> 28:36.548
<i>the rituals that I care for.</i>

28:38.675 --> 28:43.012
[Ilse] Ett Hem<i> is in a building</i>
<i>built in 1913,</i>

28:43.096 --> 28:46.683
<i>which was a really important time</i>
<i>in Swedish architectural history,</i>

28:46.766 --> 28:50.729
<i>because the home became the focus</i>
<i>for arts and life.</i>

28:55.108 --> 28:58.737
<i>The everyday was something</i>
<i>that was celebrated and delightful.</i>

29:00.572 --> 29:07.120
<i>So one of the core principles</i>
<i>was moving away from opulent luxury</i>

29:07.203 --> 29:10.957
<i>to a notion that luxury is attention.</i>
<i>It's care.</i>

29:11.624 --> 29:14.836
<i>It's actually making the ordinary</i>
<i>extraordinary.</i>

29:16.796 --> 29:18.506
[Mix] <i>Collaborating with Ilse,</i>

29:18.590 --> 29:22.385
first of all, it's complete trust,
you really feel that.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.054
<i>They are very thorough.</i>

29:29.768 --> 29:35.440
[Ilse] <i>Typically, a building process</i>
<i>is a sequence of decisions,</i>

29:36.274 --> 29:39.110
and what are called the "soft decisions"
are made at the end.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.697
If indeed there is any money
left at the end, or time.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.825
But in this case, we wanted
to reverse that process.

29:46.576 --> 29:50.288
<i>We wanted to integrate the experience</i>
<i>of the place with the design</i>

29:50.371 --> 29:51.790
<i>from the very beginning.</i>

29:53.792 --> 29:56.544
<i>To make a place where,</i>
<i>the minute you walked in,</i>

29:56.628 --> 29:59.631
<i>you just felt relaxed</i>
<i>and as though you belonged.</i>

30:00.965 --> 30:02.008
<i>A home.</i>

30:02.091 --> 30:03.718
Ett Hem:<i> a home.</i>

30:05.804 --> 30:10.975
[Mix] <i>When we came up with</i>
<i>the name </i>Ett Hem, <i>it all fell into place.</i>

30:12.060 --> 30:13.728
<i>So regarding the design,</i>

30:14.229 --> 30:17.398
<i>every decision came back to</i>
<i>how does it feel</i>

30:17.482 --> 30:19.651
<i>and how is it run in a normal home?</i>

30:23.530 --> 30:26.616
[Ilse] <i>So we got rid of front</i>
<i>and back of house.</i>

30:27.325 --> 30:30.036
<i>That formality, those boundaries.</i>

30:30.745 --> 30:35.500
<i>Not only do they take up space,</i>
<i>they also make people behave differently.</i>

30:37.168 --> 30:40.755
<i>It's more about the things you do,</i>
<i>rather than the way things look,</i>

30:41.256 --> 30:43.925
<i>and how to create</i>
<i>a proper focus for those.</i>

30:45.468 --> 30:48.179
<i>Those are the moments</i>
<i>that make it all worthwhile.</i>

30:49.597 --> 30:51.099
In Denmark, they call that <i>hygge.</i>

30:52.350 --> 30:54.310
<i>To focus on the moment,</i>

30:54.394 --> 30:58.439
<i>on making the ordinary extraordinary,</i>
<i>making the normal special.</i>

30:59.148 --> 31:01.609
<i>But what happens when we do that</i>

31:01.693 --> 31:05.280
<i>is it makes us</i>
<i>much more open to each other</i>

31:05.947 --> 31:06.990
<i>and much closer.</i>

31:08.199 --> 31:11.619
<i>And it's a really interesting way</i>
<i>of building community.</i>

31:12.954 --> 31:14.747
<i>For example, in the kitchen,</i>

31:14.831 --> 31:17.959
<i>we made it warm and inviting</i>
<i>with a great old table</i>

31:18.042 --> 31:22.255
<i>and we chose the things on the table,</i>
<i>so they really felt memorable, tactile.</i>

31:24.048 --> 31:25.300
<i>Caring about the details,</i>

31:26.217 --> 31:29.053
<i>thinking about how people</i>
<i>will experience the place.</i>

31:29.804 --> 31:32.765
<i>People understand</i>
<i>the care that's gone into that.</i>

31:35.560 --> 31:39.898
<i>Obviously, </i>Ett Hem<i> is a high-end,</i>
<i>relatively small hotel,</i>

31:41.733 --> 31:44.152
<i>but you can do this on a bigger scale.</i>

31:52.493 --> 31:57.081
<i>When you integrate design</i>
<i>into a company like IKEA,</i>

31:57.165 --> 31:58.833
<i>it can have huge effect.</i>

32:02.337 --> 32:08.301
What is so interesting about this project
is IKEA is very much a family store.

32:08.384 --> 32:10.511
You really see big families here,

32:10.595 --> 32:13.389
and it's quite tricky
to take a big family out to eat,

32:13.473 --> 32:18.561
not to mention quite expensive,
so that's a really valuable contribution.

32:19.312 --> 32:21.606
<i>The restaurant hasn't</i>
<i>kept step with the times.</i>

32:22.649 --> 32:24.692
<i>And so they want us to interrogate that.</i>

32:26.819 --> 32:29.822
This is the very area
which we're going to take

32:29.906 --> 32:32.825
-and change it all, hopefully.
-Yeah.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.746
[Engman] <i>We're in one of</i>
<i>the oldest stores now, of IKEA,</i>

32:36.829 --> 32:38.039
<i>and it's the biggest store.</i>

32:38.456 --> 32:45.421
<i>Now we're spread to 375 different stores</i>
<i>in 48 countries around the world.</i>

32:47.924 --> 32:50.426
<i>It was really a new take</i>
<i>on how to serve food</i>

32:50.510 --> 32:52.637
<i>and really good food.</i>

32:52.720 --> 32:57.725
But this is the thing. It doesn't matter
how good we do our baked salmon.

32:58.226 --> 33:01.437
If you meet it in the wrong way,
you get the wrong impression.

33:01.938 --> 33:05.775
[Ilse] Yep, it feels like airport security
at the moment, you really...

33:05.858 --> 33:08.903
-Let's say there is room for improvement.
-Yeah.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.238
[Engman laughs]

33:12.198 --> 33:16.119
[Engman] <i>We serve</i>
<i>640 million people every year.</i>

33:16.202 --> 33:20.707
And this one alone
is something like 3,500, 4,000 a day.

33:20.790 --> 33:22.667
-Yes. Huge.
-They're big numbers, yeah.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.420
[Engman] <i>What we want to do with food</i>

33:25.503 --> 33:28.214
<i>is make people live a healthier</i>
<i>and more sustainable lifestyle</i>

33:28.297 --> 33:29.716
<i>through their food choices.</i>

33:32.427 --> 33:33.636
[Ilse] It makes huge sense,

33:33.720 --> 33:37.140
because if you can change the way
that children feel about food,

33:37.223 --> 33:38.766
that really changes their futures.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.101
[Engman] <i>Yeah, absolutely.</i>

33:40.893 --> 33:44.772
[Ilse] <i>And I think design</i>
<i>really needs to address that.</i>

33:47.275 --> 33:50.236
If you think about
the scale of the project...

33:50.319 --> 33:55.825
I mean, 640 million customers a year
is beyond comprehension in a way.

33:56.826 --> 34:00.329
<i>It's a ten-year plan</i>
<i>and it's only the beginning.</i>

34:25.980 --> 34:27.523
[Peña]<i> They say</i>
<i>that behind every great man</i>

34:27.607 --> 34:28.941
<i>there's always a great woman.</i>

34:29.650 --> 34:31.069
Here, it's the opposite.

34:31.944 --> 34:35.531
Behind a great woman
maybe there's also a very good man.

34:37.450 --> 34:40.536
[Ilse] <i>I was living in New York.</i>
<i>He was living in Milan.</i>

34:40.620 --> 34:42.747
He was working
for the Design Academy Eindhoven,

34:42.830 --> 34:44.040
which I had never heard of.

34:45.666 --> 34:48.628
[Peña] <i>When we were having</i>
<i>a head of department meeting,</i>

34:48.711 --> 34:51.464
<i>I was asked if I knew someone</i>
<i>that they could recommend</i>

34:51.547 --> 34:55.134
<i>for a new design department that was</i>
<i>going to be created called Wellbeing.</i>

34:55.218 --> 34:58.054
<i>I said, "Oh, maybe there's this lady,</i>
<i>Ilse Crawford."</i>

34:59.097 --> 35:02.391
I only knew about her name and her work
from the magazine, <i>Elle Decoration</i>.

35:03.101 --> 35:06.646
<i>She wrote a book, </i>Sensual Home,
<i>and for some reason, I never bought it.</i>

35:06.729 --> 35:07.563
[laughs]

35:07.647 --> 35:11.567
But actually, I married the one
that wrote it, so I didn't have to buy it.

35:13.486 --> 35:17.865
[Ilse] <i>Oscar has been in</i>
<i>industrial product design for decades</i>

35:17.949 --> 35:19.408
<i>and has joined the business.</i>

35:19.909 --> 35:25.081
<i>He's Colombian, so he's brought in</i>
<i>this wonderful character and big heart.</i>

35:26.582 --> 35:29.252
[Peña] This one is the last green touch.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.839
That counts as a vegetable for you,
doesn't it?

35:34.215 --> 35:37.677
I remember, wasn't it
in the 14th century in Turkey the--

35:37.760 --> 35:39.011
Mmm...

35:39.095 --> 35:40.763
It was grounds for a divorce

35:40.847 --> 35:42.890
if a woman's husband
didn't make her coffee.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.726
[Peña] <i>Yeah, I usually get up</i>
<i>and make you coffee.</i>

35:45.810 --> 35:46.769
[Ilse laughs] <i>Exactly.</i>

35:48.187 --> 35:51.816
<i>I think the small moments are</i>
<i>the things you remember in life.</i>

35:51.899 --> 35:54.360
I mean, all of us remember
those connections.

35:54.902 --> 35:57.613
In the design academy,
we are both heads of departments.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.824
<i>I am Department of Man and Activity,</i>

35:59.907 --> 36:04.871
<i>which is more about kind of products,</i>
<i>services, experiences.</i>

36:04.954 --> 36:06.622
Ilse is Department of Wellbeing.

36:06.706 --> 36:10.418
<i>This kind of human engineering</i>
<i>of the emotional side of things.</i>

36:11.002 --> 36:12.170
[bicycle bell rings]

36:18.634 --> 36:20.469
[Ilse] <i>I really do want wellbeing</i>

36:20.553 --> 36:23.055
<i>in the sense of physical</i>
<i>and emotional health</i>

36:23.139 --> 36:25.391
<i>to affect as many people as possible,</i>

36:26.601 --> 36:29.145
<i>which is why I write the books,</i>
<i>why I teach.</i>

36:30.605 --> 36:32.190
<i>I hope that it's contagious.</i>

36:38.404 --> 36:39.697
<i>The whole structure of the school</i>

36:39.780 --> 36:43.618
<i>is based on using people</i>
<i>who are working professionals.</i>

36:44.827 --> 36:49.332
<i>So that's allowed me to combine my love</i>
<i>of working with the next generation</i>

36:49.415 --> 36:50.958
<i>with running my own studio.</i>

37:02.053 --> 37:04.847
When you first approached
the brush makers,

37:04.931 --> 37:06.515
their immediate answer was no--

37:06.599 --> 37:09.310
[student] Yeah, correct.
At the beginning, I think he just thought,

37:09.393 --> 37:12.897
"Okay, he will be gone this afternoon,
and then he will not come back,"

37:12.980 --> 37:14.607
but I came back the second time.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.401
He was very surprised.
That's when I gained his trust.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.530
So the old stick
is the one he made 23 years ago

37:21.614 --> 37:23.115
and I put my new broom on it.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.701
I think that's the conclusion
of our relationship,

37:25.785 --> 37:28.412
how the new one and the old
came together in a broom.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.539
-Relationships can be a bit messy.
-Yeah.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.375
You have to sort of manage through that.

37:34.210 --> 37:37.838
<i>It's really about having</i>
<i>these lively dialogues</i>

37:37.922 --> 37:39.173
<i>with young individuals,</i>

37:39.257 --> 37:43.636
<i>and then giving them the tool kits</i>
<i>to be able to develop their own voice.</i>

37:44.637 --> 37:47.223
The aim is
to enhance the food preparation.

37:47.807 --> 37:49.809
It acts like a magnifying lens,

37:49.892 --> 37:53.813
so you get a different connection
with the food you are preparing.

37:53.896 --> 37:57.149
[Ilse] What I really love about
your project is, when you look at them,

37:57.233 --> 37:59.026
on the one hand, you see kitchen utensils,

37:59.110 --> 38:01.487
and on the other hand,
you look at this material

38:01.570 --> 38:02.863
you've never seen used that way.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.156
[student] Exactly.

38:05.533 --> 38:08.119
It's been a really,
really great trimester.

38:08.703 --> 38:11.706
What I think was probably
quite challenging with the project

38:11.789 --> 38:16.961
was the collaboration and how that
really involves a craft of a relationship.

38:17.044 --> 38:22.967
It's actually a really good microcosm
of what will happen later on in life.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.845
Whether you're working
on a small scale or big scale,

38:26.971 --> 38:30.349
to be a designer focused on wellbeing,

38:30.433 --> 38:32.727
you have to start
with how things are made.

38:33.436 --> 38:37.148
You should feel very proud of yourselves
for the work you've put in this trimester,

38:37.231 --> 38:38.441
so thank you.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.699
[piano music playing]

38:46.782 --> 38:52.705
<i>Being in the school is really being part</i>
<i>of that magical process of creation.</i>

38:52.788 --> 38:55.750
<i>Seeing how things go</i>
<i>from nothing to something.</i>

38:57.877 --> 39:00.046
[piano continues playing]

39:05.551 --> 39:08.012
[Ilse] <i>And actually, now what's happening</i>
<i>in Eindhoven...</i>

39:09.180 --> 39:12.058
<i>A lot of people are now coming</i>
<i>from other cities to go and live there</i>

39:12.141 --> 39:14.810
<i>because you've got</i>
<i>the opportunity to have workshops,</i>

39:14.894 --> 39:18.439
<i>you've got all these different skill sets</i>
<i>coming together,</i>

39:18.522 --> 39:19.774
<i>a sort of mini Berlin.</i>

39:23.194 --> 39:25.321
<i>I think design's got a great future.</i>

39:25.863 --> 39:28.199
[piano continues playing]

39:32.286 --> 39:37.041
<i>Wellbeing is now a philosophy</i>
<i>that's permeating a lot of design.</i>

39:42.338 --> 39:44.340
<i>My fundamental hope, really,</i>

39:44.423 --> 39:48.677
<i>is that everybody starts to think</i>
<i>in terms of putting people first,</i>

39:48.761 --> 39:53.641
<i>and that's really something that</i>
<i>can be done on an individual basis.</i>

39:54.392 --> 39:56.852
[piano continues playing]

39:56.936 --> 39:59.355
<i>I mean, it's a pretty simple mission...</i>

40:00.398 --> 40:03.192
<i>and we do it one space at a time.</i>

40:03.275 --> 40:04.902
<i>One piece of design at a time.</i>

40:08.614 --> 40:12.201
<i>When you prioritize the human needs</i>
<i>within a space,</i>

40:12.284 --> 40:14.829
<i>design can have a profound impact.</i>

40:19.667 --> 40:21.669
[piano continues playing]

40:24.672 --> 40:28.134
<i>I hope that we can add</i>
<i>to the sum of human happiness.</i>

40:29.635 --> 40:31.637
<i>To leave the world a better place.</i>
