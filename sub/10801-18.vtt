00:05.800 --> 00:09.465
- Damage report.
- Casualties all over the ship.

00:09.596 --> 00:12.003
Starboard nacelle
sustained an impact.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.967
We are venting drive plasma.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.177
Initiating emergency core-shutdown.

00:16.311 --> 00:19.431
Inertial dampers failing.
Losing attitude control.

00:19.564 --> 00:22.435
This is the bridge.
All hands to escape pods.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.071
Core shutdown is unsuccessful.

00:29.200 --> 00:31.869
We are losing antimatter containment.

00:31.994 --> 00:33.536
We've got to eject the core.

00:33.663 --> 00:37.198
Ejection systems off line.
Core breach is imminent.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.993
All hands, abandon ship!

00:39.669 --> 00:41.578
Repeat. All hands, abandon...

01:14.122 --> 01:17.242
Space, the final frontier.

01:18.793 --> 01:22.245
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

01:22.964 --> 01:27.176
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

01:28.345 --> 01:31.845
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

01:32.975 --> 01:36.510
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.788
Captain's log, stardate 45652.1.

02:38.919 --> 02:44.258
The Enterprise has entered an area
known as the Typhon Expanse.

02:44.383 --> 02:47.752
We're the first Starfleet vessel
to chart this region.

02:57.230 --> 02:59.519
I wonder if he's stacking the deck.

02:59.649 --> 03:03.481
I assure you, the cards
are sufficiently randomised.

03:03.612 --> 03:05.901
I hope so.

03:08.075 --> 03:11.740
Eight. Ace. Queen.

03:11.870 --> 03:13.828
The dealer receives a four.

03:15.416 --> 03:16.661
No bet.

03:20.838 --> 03:24.456
Ten. Seven. No help there.

03:24.634 --> 03:27.551
Pair of ladies for the Doctor.

03:27.679 --> 03:30.134
Dealer receives a nine.

03:34.394 --> 03:39.899
Doctor? You show the highest hand.
You control the next bet.

03:40.651 --> 03:42.394
Thank you, Data.

03:44.488 --> 03:45.947
I bet ten.

03:48.409 --> 03:49.737
Worf?

03:52.038 --> 03:57.032
Jack. Four. Deuce. Six.

03:59.420 --> 04:00.583
20.

04:06.177 --> 04:09.013
Your 20, and 50 more.

04:09.139 --> 04:10.135
50?

04:19.358 --> 04:20.733
I'm in.

04:21.442 --> 04:23.650
I will also see the bet.

04:24.780 --> 04:27.616
Seven.
A possible straight for Cmdr Riker.

04:28.200 --> 04:31.652
Jack. Still no help for the Klingon.
Eight.

04:32.622 --> 04:34.116
Nine for the dealer.

04:38.878 --> 04:40.159
20.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.007
Too rich for my blood.

04:45.844 --> 04:48.549
Your 200, 100 more.

04:51.809 --> 04:53.552
Fold.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.566
200.

05:02.862 --> 05:04.938
Your two, and 300 more.

05:07.075 --> 05:09.032
He does not have a straight.

05:09.661 --> 05:12.366
Well, we'll soon find out, won't we?

05:14.708 --> 05:16.451
Let's see your cards.

05:19.254 --> 05:20.452
Take it.

05:22.674 --> 05:26.257
- How did you know I was bluffing?
- I just had a feeling.

05:26.387 --> 05:29.056
I guess it's better
to be lucky than good.

05:29.181 --> 05:32.764
It's the way your left eyebrow raises
when you're bluffing.

05:33.602 --> 05:35.394
Just kidding, Commander.

05:36.314 --> 05:38.852
- Ogawa to Dr Crusher.
- Go ahead.

05:38.983 --> 05:41.225
Cmdr La Forge needs you in sickbay.

05:41.361 --> 05:42.903
On my way.

05:49.327 --> 05:52.613
At first I thought
the catwalk was spinning.

05:52.748 --> 05:54.621
It turns out it was me.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.743
Luckily, Fletcher grabbed me.

05:57.878 --> 06:01.496
It's a long way down
to the bottom of the warp core.

06:01.632 --> 06:05.464
You have the symptoms
of an inner-ear infection.

06:05.594 --> 06:08.631
That would explain
the dizziness and headaches.

06:08.764 --> 06:11.137
But there's no physical evidence.

06:11.267 --> 06:14.470
My guess
is you've been working too hard.

06:14.604 --> 06:18.898
I have been putting in extra hours
on this Typhon Expanse project.

06:19.025 --> 06:22.311
20cc of vertazine
should clear up the dizziness.

06:22.445 --> 06:26.360
But finding time to relax
is up to you.

06:27.284 --> 06:28.944
What? What is it?

06:29.620 --> 06:32.027
Have you had these symptoms before?

06:32.748 --> 06:33.744
No.

06:33.874 --> 06:36.199
- You're sure?
- I'm positive. Why?

06:38.087 --> 06:42.998
It's funny. I feel like
we've discussed this before.

06:43.134 --> 06:46.301
I remember giving you
a hypospray for dizziness.

06:46.429 --> 06:50.379
I've never had these symptoms.
You're thinking of another patient.

06:51.101 --> 06:53.508
No, I'm sure it was you.

06:55.313 --> 06:57.520
Well, try to get some rest.

06:57.649 --> 07:01.184
Stay away from high places
for a few days.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.778
Thanks, Doc.

07:04.031 --> 07:05.940
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

08:28.703 --> 08:31.490
As you can see,
the Typhon Expanse is huge.

08:31.623 --> 08:35.490
If we want to chart it,
we'll have to launch a probe soon.

08:35.626 --> 08:37.916
What about the luminosity studies?

08:38.046 --> 08:40.335
- That may pose a problem.
- How so?

08:40.465 --> 08:42.624
The spectrometers are still down.

08:42.759 --> 08:44.966
They were supposed to be on line.

08:45.095 --> 08:49.307
They were until Stellar Dynamics
decided to install new modules.

08:49.433 --> 08:51.971
I recommend a graviton polarimeter.

08:52.103 --> 08:55.721
- It performs a similar function.
- Make it so, Mr Data.

08:55.856 --> 08:58.811
Captain,
I have something I'd like to report.

08:58.943 --> 09:00.521
Yes, Doctor?

09:01.279 --> 09:04.399
I heard voices in my room last night.

09:04.532 --> 09:08.198
I was alone,
so I thought I was imagining things.

09:08.328 --> 09:12.789
But ten other people reported
hearing voices at the same time.

09:12.916 --> 09:14.494
What were they saying?

09:15.502 --> 09:17.246
I couldn't make them out.

09:18.005 --> 09:20.959
Data, did the sensors
pick up anything unusual?

09:21.717 --> 09:23.959
No anomalous readings were reported.

09:25.054 --> 09:27.723
When we're through,
recheck the sensor logs.

09:27.848 --> 09:30.174
- Aye, sir.
- Counsellor?

09:31.102 --> 09:33.427
I sensed nothing unusual last night.

09:34.731 --> 09:36.474
Maybe it's the comm system.

09:37.859 --> 09:40.148
- Bridge to Capt Picard.
- Go ahead.

09:40.278 --> 09:44.358
We have unusual readings, 20,000
kilometres off the starboard bow.

09:44.491 --> 09:46.234
On our way.

09:51.707 --> 09:53.284
Report.

09:53.417 --> 09:57.035
Sensors didn't detect
the phenomenon until now, sir.

09:57.171 --> 10:00.920
It is a localised distortion
of the space-time continuum.

10:01.050 --> 10:02.461
On screen.

10:08.933 --> 10:12.385
Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.801
Aye, sir.

10:14.564 --> 10:17.234
Manoeuvring thrusters
are not responding.

10:17.359 --> 10:19.316
Distortion field is fluctuating.

10:24.741 --> 10:27.908
All main systems down.
Power levels dropping rapidly.

10:28.037 --> 10:29.282
Red alert.

10:29.413 --> 10:31.453
There is an energy build-up.

10:31.582 --> 10:34.073
We have to get out of here.

10:34.210 --> 10:36.119
Captain, something is emerging.

10:39.882 --> 10:41.875
Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres.

10:43.052 --> 10:46.137
- Shields inoperative.
- The helm's not responding.

10:46.264 --> 10:50.511
The vessel is on a collision course.
Impact in 36 seconds.

10:50.644 --> 10:51.889
Hail them.

10:52.813 --> 10:54.188
No response.

10:55.941 --> 10:57.186
Suggestions?

10:57.317 --> 11:01.778
Decompress main shuttlebay
to kick us out of the way.

11:01.906 --> 11:05.773
I suggest we use the tractor beam
to alter their trajectory.

11:05.910 --> 11:07.404
Mr Worf, make it so.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.161
Engaging tractor beam.

11:15.962 --> 11:20.090
- Damage report.
- Casualties all over the ship.

11:20.216 --> 11:22.672
Starboard nacelle
sustained an impact.

11:22.802 --> 11:26.670
- Venting drive plasma.
- Initiating core shutdown.

11:26.807 --> 11:29.927
Inertial dampers failing.
Losing attitude control.

11:30.060 --> 11:33.061
This is the bridge.
All hands to escape pods.

11:38.110 --> 11:40.067
Core shutdown was unsuccessful.

11:40.196 --> 11:42.402
We are losing antimatter containment.

11:42.531 --> 11:44.524
We've got to eject the core.

11:44.659 --> 11:48.028
Ejection systems off line.
Core breach is imminent.

11:48.162 --> 11:50.036
All hands, abandon ship!

11:50.165 --> 11:51.956
Repeat, all hands, abandon...

11:59.549 --> 12:03.001
Captain's log, stardate 45652.1.

12:03.136 --> 12:07.134
The Enterprise has entered an area
known as the Typhon Expanse.

12:07.266 --> 12:10.682
We are the first Starfleet vessel
to chart this region.

12:12.021 --> 12:14.690
I wonder if he's stacking the deck.

12:14.815 --> 12:18.019
I assure you, the cards
are sufficiently randomised.

12:18.152 --> 12:20.062
I hope so.

12:23.533 --> 12:27.151
Eight. Ace. Queen.

12:28.079 --> 12:29.871
The dealer receives a four.

12:33.585 --> 12:34.830
No bet.

12:37.047 --> 12:40.048
Ten. Seven. No help there.

12:40.759 --> 12:44.757
Pair of ladies for the Doctor.
Dealer receives a nine.

12:46.390 --> 12:51.515
Doctor? You show the highest hand.
You control the next bet.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.391
Is there something wrong, Doctor?

12:56.526 --> 12:59.195
No. I'll bet ten.

13:04.201 --> 13:09.540
Jack. Four. Deuce. Six.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.911
20.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.918
Your 20. I'll raise you 50.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.467
You're going to call my bluff.

13:25.264 --> 13:27.637
I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.

13:27.767 --> 13:30.554
How did you know
I'd call your bluff?

13:30.687 --> 13:35.349
- I just had a feeling.
- Me, too.

13:36.234 --> 13:39.438
- Ogawa to Dr Crusher.
- Go ahead.

13:39.571 --> 13:43.901
- Cmdr La Forge needs you in sickbay.
- On my way.

13:52.752 --> 13:57.081
At first I thought the catwalk
was spinning. Turns out it was me.

13:59.717 --> 14:01.840
Luckily, Fletcher grabbed me.

14:01.970 --> 14:05.255
It's a long way down
to the bottom of the warp core.

14:05.390 --> 14:08.225
You have the symptoms
of an inner-ear infection.

14:08.351 --> 14:11.187
That would explain
the headaches and dizziness.

14:11.313 --> 14:13.187
But there's no physical...

14:14.691 --> 14:16.316
What?

14:17.694 --> 14:20.945
- What is it?
- Have you had these symptoms before?

14:22.575 --> 14:26.524
- Come to think of it, yes.
- Do you recall when?

14:27.538 --> 14:29.365
No, I don't...

14:31.042 --> 14:36.000
We've had this discussion before.
I've given you this examination.

14:36.130 --> 14:38.004
Let's check the medical logs.

14:46.808 --> 14:49.975
You've been treated
for headaches from your visor

14:50.103 --> 14:52.808
but I read no mention of dizziness.

14:55.067 --> 14:56.692
Must be dej a vu.

14:57.278 --> 15:00.362
Both of us? About the same thing?

16:09.687 --> 16:12.392
- Crusher to Picard.
- Yes, Doctor?

16:14.442 --> 16:16.518
Do you have a minute?

16:22.742 --> 16:27.654
My Aunt Adele cured a lot of
sleepless nights with steamed milk.

16:29.207 --> 16:31.117
Thank you.

16:32.044 --> 16:33.324
Nutmeg.

16:33.462 --> 16:37.791
Whenever I get insomnia,
I try to perfect the recipe.

16:37.925 --> 16:39.834
It was the eeriest feeling.

16:42.096 --> 16:43.887
When the glass broke,

16:44.015 --> 16:48.511
it triggered the sensation even more
that I'd done it all before.

16:50.647 --> 16:55.890
You know, earlier,
I was reading this book...

16:57.821 --> 16:59.778
...and I had the distinct feeling

16:59.906 --> 17:03.026
that I'd read
certain paragraphs before.

17:03.160 --> 17:07.703
But I assumed that I'd read the book
years ago and I'd forgotten.

17:09.916 --> 17:15.160
I've had this feeling for hours.
And then the voices...

17:16.464 --> 17:22.586
Well, it could be nothing more
than the result of a sleepless night.

17:22.722 --> 17:24.181
But let's be sure.

17:24.307 --> 17:27.094
Have Data and Geordi
run a diagnostic

17:27.227 --> 17:29.718
on the time and place
you heard the voices.

17:29.854 --> 17:33.188
We'll discuss the results tomorrow
at 0700 hours.

17:33.316 --> 17:35.190
Thank you.

17:36.486 --> 17:37.897
For everything.

17:38.030 --> 17:40.603
No, thank Aunt Adele.

17:48.874 --> 17:50.832
The internal scans were negative.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.914
There was no evidence
of auditory anomalies.

17:54.047 --> 17:57.961
As far as the sensors are concerned,
nothing unusual happened.

17:58.092 --> 18:02.719
Ten other people reported hearing
voices at the same time I did.

18:02.847 --> 18:05.173
- Bridge to Capt Picard.
- Go ahead.

18:05.308 --> 18:10.267
We have unusual readings, 20,000
kilometres off the starboard bow.

18:10.397 --> 18:12.057
On our way.

18:16.445 --> 18:17.904
Report.

18:18.030 --> 18:21.067
Sensors didn't detect the phenomenon
until now.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.783
It is a localised distortion

18:25.329 --> 18:26.705
On screen.

18:35.006 --> 18:38.173
Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow.

18:38.301 --> 18:40.175
Aye, sir.

18:40.303 --> 18:42.877
Manoeuvring thrusters

18:43.015 --> 18:45.007

Suggestions?

19:23.140 --> 19:26.592
Decompress main shuttlebay
to blow us out of the way.

19:26.727 --> 19:31.140
I suggest we use the tractor beam
to alter their trajectory.

19:31.566 --> 19:34.650
- Make it so, Mr Worf.
- Engaging tractor beam.

19:41.534 --> 19:45.034
- Damage report.
- Casualties all over the ship.

19:45.163 --> 19:47.619
Starboard nacelle
sustained an impact.

19:47.749 --> 19:49.659
We are venting drive plasma.

19:49.793 --> 19:52.249
Initiating emergency core-shutdown.

19:52.379 --> 19:55.499
Inertial dampers failing.
Losing attitude control.

19:55.633 --> 19:58.836
This is the bridge.
All hands to escape pods.

20:02.765 --> 20:06.929
Core shutdown unsuccessful.
We are losing antimatter containment.

20:07.061 --> 20:08.721
We've got to eject the core.

20:08.855 --> 20:12.603
Ejector systems off line.
Core breach imminent.

20:12.734 --> 20:14.442
All hands, abandon ship!

20:14.569 --> 20:16.894
Repeat, all hands, abandon...

20:24.037 --> 20:27.407
Captain's log, stardate 45652.1.

20:27.541 --> 20:31.456
The Enterprise has entered an area
known as the Typhon Expanse.

20:31.587 --> 20:34.837
We are the first Starfleet vessel
to chart this region.

20:37.426 --> 20:39.882
I wonder if he's stacking the deck.

20:40.012 --> 20:43.132
I assure you, the cards
are sufficiently randomised.

20:43.266 --> 20:46.184
I hope... so.

20:47.353 --> 20:48.896
Something wrong, Mr Worf?

20:51.024 --> 20:57.145
I am experiencing nlb'poH,
the feeling I have done this before.

20:57.281 --> 20:59.772
- Last Tuesday.
- That's not what I mean.

20:59.908 --> 21:03.657
I've been having the same feeling.
Keep dealing, Data.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.326
Eight. Ace.

21:08.459 --> 21:11.579
A queen.
You're going to give me a queen.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.343
You're going to get a four.

21:23.183 --> 21:24.463
Deal, Data.

21:24.976 --> 21:27.681
- But no one has bet.
- Forget the bet. Just deal.

21:29.147 --> 21:30.392
Ten.

21:31.608 --> 21:33.731
Seven. Queen.

21:35.362 --> 21:38.032
Nine. Jack.

21:38.866 --> 21:42.946
- Four.
- Deuce. Six.

21:46.457 --> 21:48.829
This is highly improbable.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.914
- How did we know?
- Wait.

21:52.046 --> 21:53.505
Crusher to sickbay.

21:53.631 --> 21:56.632
- Sickbay here.
- Is Cmdr La Forge there?

21:56.760 --> 21:58.420
No, Doctor, he's not.

22:00.972 --> 22:03.808
Wait a minute. He just came in.

22:11.984 --> 22:14.440
- You wanted to see me, Doctor?
- Yes.

22:14.570 --> 22:17.405
Captain, have you been
getting the feeling

22:17.531 --> 22:20.201
that you've experienced
things before?

22:20.326 --> 22:22.153
A sense of repetition?

22:24.873 --> 22:28.324
Yes, recently. While I was reading.
Why do you ask?

22:28.918 --> 22:31.955
There have been similar incidents
all over the ship.

22:32.088 --> 22:34.377
Feelings of dej a vu.

22:35.092 --> 22:38.258
I had a premonition
Geordi would come into sickbay.

22:38.387 --> 22:41.922
Seconds later he did. With the
symptoms of an ear infection.

22:42.599 --> 22:44.391
I was going to run tests

22:44.518 --> 22:47.188
but I had
a feeling they'd be negative.

22:47.938 --> 22:50.939
So I ran an optical diagnostic

22:51.067 --> 22:54.187
which traced the problem
to Geordi's visor.

22:54.862 --> 22:56.357
His dizziness is caused

22:56.489 --> 22:59.159
by a phase shift
in his visual receptors,

22:59.284 --> 23:01.953
making him see images
that aren't there.

23:02.078 --> 23:04.616
They're like blurry after-images.

23:04.748 --> 23:07.665
I ran a scan to see
if I could detect what he saw.

23:07.793 --> 23:11.791
I picked up distortions
in the surrounding dekyon field.

23:11.922 --> 23:15.967
Somehow his visor translates them
into visual impulses.

23:16.093 --> 23:19.177
Could be a malfunction
in the warp-field generator.

23:19.305 --> 23:22.389
Run a localised subspace scan
for anything else.

23:24.518 --> 23:26.013
Keep me advised.

24:40.223 --> 24:42.975
- Crusher to Cmdr La Forge.
- La Forge here.

24:43.101 --> 24:47.810
Geordi, I just heard what sounded
like voices in my room.

24:47.939 --> 24:50.098
But no one else is here.

24:50.233 --> 24:53.934
Sensors picked up something strange.
We're checking it out.

24:54.071 --> 24:55.814
I'm on my way.

25:04.081 --> 25:07.332
Looks like you managed
to record 6.2 seconds' worth.

25:07.460 --> 25:10.378
Let's see
if we can filter the signal.

25:10.505 --> 25:14.206
- Then I wasn't hearing things?
- The sound appears real.

25:14.342 --> 25:18.007
However, it does not
correspond to any ship's system,

25:18.138 --> 25:20.711
nor to any voice communication
at that time.

25:20.849 --> 25:22.925
Then where did it come from?

25:23.060 --> 25:24.887
You heard it at the same time

25:25.020 --> 25:28.104
our scan picked up
a dekyon-field distortion.

25:28.232 --> 25:31.731
The two may be related.
Let's have another listen.

25:37.742 --> 25:40.826
Computer, perform
a narrow-bandwidth analysis.

25:40.953 --> 25:43.658
Eliminate
non-vocal waveform components.

25:49.671 --> 25:53.503
Can we isolate the voices?
Find out what they're saying?

25:53.633 --> 25:56.089
Computer, continuous playback.

26:05.729 --> 26:09.644
There are approximately
1,000 voices overlapping.

26:09.775 --> 26:12.776
The voices
are those of the Enterprise crew.

26:13.821 --> 26:15.613
Our voices.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.878
I'm sorry to call you so early

26:33.008 --> 26:35.297
but we couldn't wait
till 0700 hours.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.594
We think we have an explanation
for the occurrences.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.672
- Commander.
- This is gonna sound pretty wild.

26:42.810 --> 26:47.768
Somehow we seem to have entered
a temporal-causality loop.

26:47.899 --> 26:50.769
We think we're stuck
in a fragment in time.

26:50.902 --> 26:54.022
We've been repeating that fragment
over and over.

26:54.155 --> 26:56.065
Is this causing our dej a vu?

26:56.199 --> 27:00.493
Yes, but it's more. In dej a vu,
you think you're repeating events.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.325
- We actually are.
- Our theory is this.

27:03.457 --> 27:05.533
Every time the loop begins again,

27:05.667 --> 27:08.372
everything resets itself
and starts all over.

27:08.504 --> 27:10.496
We don't remember anything

27:10.631 --> 27:13.585
so each time,
we think it's the first.

27:13.717 --> 27:17.965
You mean we could have had
this conversation a dozen times?

27:18.097 --> 27:21.466
A dozen, a hundred.
It's impossible to tell.

27:21.601 --> 27:26.512
We could have been here for hours,
days, maybe years.

27:26.648 --> 27:28.522
If what we're saying is true,

27:28.650 --> 27:32.600
those voices I heard
might be echoes from previous loops.

27:32.737 --> 27:34.944
It's the same with my visor.

27:35.073 --> 27:36.651
After-images in time.

27:38.285 --> 27:42.365
If you're right, how did it happen?
How did we get there?

27:42.498 --> 27:45.368
I have a hypothesis
that may explain that.

27:45.501 --> 27:47.790
I have analysed the recording.

27:47.920 --> 27:49.664
Most is quite ordinary.

27:49.797 --> 27:52.715
150 discussions
about ship operations,

27:52.842 --> 27:55.594
252 conversations
of a personal nature,

27:55.720 --> 27:58.009
five couples
in romantic encounters...

27:58.139 --> 27:59.847
Your point, Mr Data?

28:00.642 --> 28:04.141
There is evidence
of a disaster aboard the Enterprise,

28:04.271 --> 28:07.307
severe enough that the Captain
ordered all hands

28:07.441 --> 28:09.101
to abandon ship.

28:09.234 --> 28:13.813
I have isolated three segments
of this recording that are crucial.

28:13.947 --> 28:17.613
A localised distortion
of the space-time continuum.

28:17.743 --> 28:20.448
Collision course.
Impact in 36 seconds.

28:21.330 --> 28:22.955
All hands, abandon ship!

28:23.082 --> 28:24.909
Repeat. All hands, abandon...

28:26.794 --> 28:28.787
Worf refers to a distortion.

28:28.921 --> 28:32.421
If this were temporal
and we were close enough,

28:32.550 --> 28:36.595
it's possible an explosion ruptured
the space-time continuum.

28:36.721 --> 28:41.051
We collided, exploded, then got
caught in this repeating loop.

28:41.184 --> 28:44.518
If you're right, we could escape
by avoiding collision.

28:44.646 --> 28:46.141
That's our guess.

28:46.690 --> 28:48.647
Perhaps we should reverse course.

28:48.776 --> 28:52.690
For all we know, reversing course
may lead us into the crash.

28:53.697 --> 28:56.983
No. We can't start
second-guessing ourselves.

28:57.118 --> 29:00.072
Stay on course
until we have reason to change.

29:00.204 --> 29:03.455
But let's do everything we can
to avoid the collision.

29:03.583 --> 29:08.126
We might not be able to figure out
how to avoid this accident.

29:08.254 --> 29:12.418
If the loop begins again, we'll
forget everything we've learned.

29:14.344 --> 29:15.803
What do you suggest?

29:15.929 --> 29:18.301
If we find a way
to avoid this collision,

29:18.432 --> 29:21.302
we should send that information
into the next loop.

29:21.435 --> 29:23.143
Is that possible?

29:23.270 --> 29:26.935
We have seen that echoes or
after-images from previous loops

29:27.066 --> 29:30.067
appear as distortions
in the dekyon field.

29:30.194 --> 29:33.694
We could send an echo
into the next loop.

29:33.823 --> 29:36.314
- Like a message in a bottle?
- Exactly.

29:36.451 --> 29:40.662
We could enhance a dekyon emission
and send ourselves a message.

29:40.789 --> 29:43.624
Not a long one,
only a few characters.

29:43.750 --> 29:45.292
Maybe one word.

29:45.418 --> 29:47.791
How will we know
to pick up that word?

29:47.921 --> 29:51.006
If the dekyon emission
is modulated correctly,

29:51.133 --> 29:55.047
it will set up resonances
in my positronic subprocessors.

29:55.179 --> 29:59.093
I will receive the information
on a subconscious level.

29:59.225 --> 30:00.635
There's the catch.

30:00.768 --> 30:03.935
We don't know
how this will be perceived by Data.

30:04.063 --> 30:07.313
It might be like
a post-hypnotic suggestion.

30:07.442 --> 30:09.933
Even so, we've got to try.

30:10.069 --> 30:14.019
Take whatever steps are necessary
to send a message. Dismissed.

30:15.325 --> 30:19.702
It's possible we've tried this
1,000 times and it's never worked.

30:20.288 --> 30:22.958
Do you feel
that you've done this before?

30:23.083 --> 30:24.162
No, I don't.

30:24.293 --> 30:26.962
Neither do I.
Maybe that's a good sign.

30:27.087 --> 30:29.044
Let's test the emitter.

30:31.842 --> 30:34.879
Particle accelerators at full power.

30:35.721 --> 30:38.639
Dekyon field active.

30:38.766 --> 30:41.684
Particle flux nominal.
We're in business.

30:41.811 --> 30:44.017
All we need now is a message.

30:44.147 --> 30:45.938
Senior officers, to the bridge.

30:46.065 --> 30:47.725
On our way.

30:50.236 --> 30:53.321
We have to figure out
how we handled this before.

30:56.994 --> 30:59.864
Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow.

30:59.997 --> 31:01.539
Aye, sir.

31:02.249 --> 31:04.705
Manoeuvring thrusters
are not responding.

31:04.835 --> 31:06.662
Distortion field is fluctuating.

31:11.050 --> 31:14.715
All main systems down.
Power levels are dropping.

31:14.846 --> 31:17.716
There is an energy build-up.

31:17.849 --> 31:20.221
We have to get out of here.

31:20.351 --> 31:21.976
Something is emerging.

31:24.230 --> 31:26.140
Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres.

31:27.067 --> 31:30.602
- Shields inoperative.
- The helm's not responding.

31:30.737 --> 31:34.320
The vessel is on a collision course.
Impact in 36 seconds.

31:34.450 --> 31:37.735
- Hail them.
- No response.

31:41.874 --> 31:43.155
Suggestions?

31:43.292 --> 31:46.792
Decompress main shuttlebay
to blow us out of the way.

31:46.921 --> 31:51.049
I suggest we use the tractor beam
to alter their trajectory.

31:51.175 --> 31:54.758
- Make it so, Mr Worf.
- Engaging tractor beam.

32:00.143 --> 32:04.011
- Damage report.
- Casualties all over the ship.

32:04.147 --> 32:06.685
Starboard nacelle
sustained an impact.

32:07.067 --> 32:11.397
- We are venting drive plasma.
- Emergency core shutdown.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.615
Inertial dampers failing.
Losing attitude control.

32:14.742 --> 32:18.076
This is the bridge.
All hands to escape pods.

32:21.833 --> 32:25.961
Core shutdown is unsuccessful.
We are losing antimatter containment.

32:26.087 --> 32:28.210
We've got to eject the core.

32:28.339 --> 32:32.384
Ejection systems are off line.
Core breach is imminent.

32:32.510 --> 32:34.088
All hands, abandon ship!

32:34.221 --> 32:36.178
Repeat, all hands, abandon...

32:44.523 --> 32:47.726
Captain's log, stardate 45652.1.

32:47.860 --> 32:51.905
The Enterprise has entered an area
known as the Typhon Expanse.

32:52.031 --> 32:55.483
We are the first Starfleet vessel
to chart this region.

32:57.537 --> 32:59.862
I wonder if he's stacking the deck.

32:59.998 --> 33:03.414
I assure you, the cards
are sufficiently randomised.

33:03.543 --> 33:05.002
I hope so.

33:07.339 --> 33:09.248
Something wrong, Mr Worf?

33:09.966 --> 33:15.127
I am experiencing nlb'poH,
the feeling I have done this before.

33:15.264 --> 33:18.300
- Last Tuesday night.
- That's not what I mean.

33:18.434 --> 33:21.554
I've been having the same feeling.
Wait!

33:23.648 --> 33:28.226
An eight. An ace. A queen.
And a four.

33:28.361 --> 33:29.855
Deal the cards, Data.

33:34.701 --> 33:36.409
Three. All threes.

33:36.536 --> 33:40.783
I was positive I knew what cards
were going to be dealt.

33:40.916 --> 33:42.789
I was also sure.

33:42.918 --> 33:44.578
Finish dealing the hand.

33:55.806 --> 33:59.092
Look at this.
We've all got three of a kind.

34:00.686 --> 34:05.514
First we get a three
and then three of a kind.

34:06.484 --> 34:08.062
Ogawa to Dr Crusher.

34:08.902 --> 34:10.481
Go ahead.

34:10.612 --> 34:13.105
Cmdr La Forge needs you in sickbay.

34:14.284 --> 34:16.027
I'm on my way.

34:22.918 --> 34:25.588
At first I thought the catwalk
was spinning.

34:25.713 --> 34:27.621
It turns out it was me.

34:28.132 --> 34:30.125
Luckily, Fletcher grabbed me.

34:30.259 --> 34:33.675
It's a long way down
to the bottom of the warp core.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.675
You have the symptoms
of an inner-ear infection.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.513
That would explain
the headaches and dizziness.

34:39.643 --> 34:42.016
But I don't see any physical...

34:42.813 --> 34:45.601
What? What is it?

34:45.734 --> 34:48.438
Have you had these symptoms before?

34:49.780 --> 34:52.271
Now that you mention it, yes.

34:52.407 --> 34:54.199
Do you recall when?

34:55.119 --> 34:56.909
No, I don't.

34:57.705 --> 34:59.781
We've had this discussion before.

34:59.915 --> 35:02.667
I remember giving you
this examination.

35:02.793 --> 35:04.703
Let's check the medical logs.

35:11.427 --> 35:14.512
You've been treated for headaches
from your visor

35:14.639 --> 35:16.430
but no mention of dizziness.

35:16.558 --> 35:18.182
Must be dej a vu.

35:18.727 --> 35:21.348
Both of us? About the same thing?

35:22.981 --> 35:25.437
I'd like to run
an optical diagnostic.

35:25.567 --> 35:27.275
For an ear infection?

35:27.986 --> 35:29.944
I have a hunch.

35:34.118 --> 35:37.368
Hold still.
This pulse may be a little bright.

35:45.922 --> 35:48.923
Have you made changes
to your visor lately?

35:49.050 --> 35:50.331
No, why?

35:51.177 --> 35:55.306
I'm detecting a small phase shift
in your visual receptors.

36:31.053 --> 36:32.962
Crusher to Capt Picard.

36:33.680 --> 36:34.760
Yes?

36:34.890 --> 36:37.428
Can you come to sickbay? Lt's urgent.

36:37.559 --> 36:39.552
I'm on my way.

36:48.863 --> 36:52.528
Dizziness is from a phase shift
in his visual receptors.

36:52.659 --> 36:55.280
It's causing him to see things.

36:55.412 --> 36:57.404
Like blurry after-images.

36:57.539 --> 37:00.291
I ran a scan to see
if I could detect what he saw.

37:00.417 --> 37:03.916
I picked up distortions
in the surrounding dekyon field.

37:04.046 --> 37:09.253
His visor seems to be translating
them into visual impulses.

37:09.385 --> 37:13.003
Could be a malfunction
in the warp-field generator.

37:13.138 --> 37:16.839
Run a localised subspace scan
for anything unusual.

37:17.018 --> 37:18.346
Aye, sir.

37:19.437 --> 37:21.061
Keep me advised, Doctor.

37:24.817 --> 37:28.436
Lateral sensors on line.
Subspace scanners active.

37:28.571 --> 37:32.190
Data, run a level-two diagnostic
on the warp subsystems.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.831
All threes. That can't be right.

37:41.960 --> 37:46.124
I have encountered the numeral three
many times in the last two hours.

37:49.176 --> 37:54.301
We have a dekyon-field fluctuation
on deck nine, section 28.

37:54.432 --> 37:56.757
- Crusher to La Forge.
- Here.

37:56.893 --> 38:01.021
I've just heard voices in my room,
but there's no one here.

38:01.147 --> 38:03.934
Sensors picked up
something strange, too.

38:04.067 --> 38:05.347
On my way.

38:07.112 --> 38:09.781
Dr Crusher. Are you alright?

38:09.906 --> 38:11.566
I'm fine.

38:13.619 --> 38:16.655
I have isolated three segments
of this recording.

38:17.206 --> 38:20.906
A localised distortion
of the space-time continuum.

38:21.043 --> 38:24.246
Collision course.
Impact in 36 seconds.

38:24.380 --> 38:27.963
All hands, abandon ship!
Repeat, all hands, abandon...

38:29.218 --> 38:30.926
Worf refers to a distortion.

38:31.054 --> 38:34.174
If this were temporal
and we were close enough to it,

38:34.307 --> 38:39.265
it's possible an explosion ruptured
the space-time continuum.

38:39.396 --> 38:44.391
We collided, exploded, then got stuck
in this repeating loop.

38:44.526 --> 38:48.394
If you're right, perhaps we can
escape by avoiding collision.

38:48.530 --> 38:50.819
- That's our guess.
- Reverse course.

38:50.949 --> 38:54.319
For all we know, reversing course
might lead to the crash.

38:54.453 --> 38:56.695
We can't second guess ourselves.

38:56.831 --> 38:59.748
Stay on course
until we have reason to change.

38:59.876 --> 39:03.576
In the meantime,
do what we can to avoid a collision.

39:03.713 --> 39:07.296
We've seen the number three
all over the ship.

39:07.425 --> 39:09.833
On consoles, in a poker game.

39:09.969 --> 39:14.964
To date, we have encountered 2,085
examples of the number three.

39:15.100 --> 39:18.220
All these threes
can't be coming up by accident.

39:18.353 --> 39:20.891
Maybe someone
is telling us something.

39:21.023 --> 39:24.522
We came to the same conclusion,
so we ran a diagnostic.

39:24.652 --> 39:28.863
We found a dekyon-field modulation
in Data's subprocessors.

39:28.989 --> 39:32.074
- What could be causing it?
- I don't know.

39:32.201 --> 39:35.570
But if I wanted to send information
between loops,

39:35.705 --> 39:37.614
I might use a dekyon emission.

39:37.749 --> 39:40.666
- We sent ourselves a message?
- It would make sense.

39:40.793 --> 39:43.201
Maybe we are trying
to contact ourselves.

39:43.338 --> 39:46.505
If that were true,
what could three indicate?

39:47.425 --> 39:50.213
We should run
a level-three diagnostic.

39:50.345 --> 39:54.177
That's a good idea.
I'll run an algorithm on three.

39:54.308 --> 39:56.763
- Bridge to Capt Picard.
- Go ahead.

39:56.894 --> 40:00.939
We have unusual readings, 20,000
kilometres off the starboard bow.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.018
On our way.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.481
Report.

40:12.619 --> 40:15.454
Sensors didn't detect the phenomenon
until now.

40:15.580 --> 40:18.996
It is a localised distortion
of the space-time continuum.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.536
On screen.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.296
How did we handle this before?

40:29.428 --> 40:32.429
Back us off, Ensign. Nice and slow.

40:32.556 --> 40:34.015
Aye, sir.

40:35.392 --> 40:38.180
Manoeuvring thrusters
are not responding.

40:39.063 --> 40:41.139
Distortion field is fluctuating.

40:43.568 --> 40:47.067
All main systems down.
Power levels dropping rapidly.

40:47.197 --> 40:49.770
There is an energy build-up.

40:49.908 --> 40:52.233
We have to get out of here.

40:52.369 --> 40:54.196
Something is emerging.

40:57.165 --> 40:59.372
Shields up. Evasive manoeuvres.

41:00.168 --> 41:03.039
- Shields inoperative.
- The helm's not responding.

41:03.172 --> 41:06.505
The vessel will impact in 36 seconds.

41:06.634 --> 41:08.176
Hail them.

41:08.928 --> 41:10.303
No response.

41:10.971 --> 41:12.347
Suggestions?

41:12.974 --> 41:16.592
Decompress main shuttlebay
to kick us out of the way.

41:16.728 --> 41:20.856
I suggest we use the tractor beam
to alter their trajectory.

41:20.982 --> 41:22.393
Make it so.

41:22.525 --> 41:24.233
Engaging tractor beam.

41:34.246 --> 41:36.915
The tractor beam
will not be successful.

41:37.041 --> 41:39.329
I am decompressing main shuttlebay.

41:52.557 --> 41:54.633
We are clear of the distortion.

41:56.227 --> 41:57.638
Data, what happened?

41:58.772 --> 42:01.441
At the last moment,
I speculated that three

42:01.566 --> 42:05.564
might refer to the rank insignia
on Cmdr Riker's uniform.

42:05.696 --> 42:09.314
That indicated that his suggestion
was the correct course.

42:09.450 --> 42:13.578
You must have picked up
a message from the last loop

42:13.704 --> 42:16.456
and stacked the poker deck
without realising.

42:16.582 --> 42:18.124
That is possible.

42:18.250 --> 42:21.168
I may also have been responsible

42:21.295 --> 42:24.296
for the unexplained occurrences
of the number three.

42:24.924 --> 42:26.502
Mr Worf, end red alert.

42:27.594 --> 42:30.299
Try to access
a Federation timebase beacon.

42:31.348 --> 42:35.215
Let's see how long
we've been in this causality loop.

42:37.729 --> 42:42.522
Timebase confirms our chronometers
are off by 17.4 days.

42:48.324 --> 42:49.901
Reset them, Mr Data.

42:50.034 --> 42:51.279
Aye, sir.

42:52.119 --> 42:54.990
Captain, we are being hailed
by the other vessel.

42:55.122 --> 42:57.696
The computer identifies it
as USS Bozeman,

42:57.834 --> 42:59.376
a Federation starship.

43:01.045 --> 43:03.371
- Soyuz-class.
- Soyuz-class?

43:03.506 --> 43:06.591
They haven't been in service
in over 80 years.

43:08.261 --> 43:09.886
Open a channel.

43:11.139 --> 43:14.508
This is Capt Bateson
of Federation Starship Bozeman.

43:14.643 --> 43:16.719
Can we render assistance?

43:17.479 --> 43:21.062
I'm Capt Jean-Luc Picard
of Federation Starship Enterprise.

43:21.483 --> 43:23.690
We were going to ask you the same.

43:23.819 --> 43:27.023
Capt Picard,
your vessel is not familiar to us.

43:28.825 --> 43:31.576
Captain, have you any idea
what has happened?

43:32.578 --> 43:35.330
Our sensors detected
a temporal distortion.

43:35.457 --> 43:37.948
Then your ship appeared.
We nearly hit you.

43:38.668 --> 43:42.037
The Enterprise has been
in a temporal causality loop.

43:42.172 --> 43:45.173
I suspect that something similar
happened to you.

43:45.300 --> 43:48.550
You must be mistaken.
We left starbase three weeks ago.

43:52.474 --> 43:53.969
Captain.

43:55.644 --> 43:57.436
Do you know what year this is?

43:57.938 --> 44:00.346
Of course I do. It's 2278.

44:03.986 --> 44:06.691
Perhaps
you should beam aboard our ship.

44:08.950 --> 44:11.572
There's something we need to discuss.
