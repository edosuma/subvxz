WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:05.483
I, for one, loathe that
we live in a surveillance state,

00:05.527 --> 00:07.311
but is there any chance
there is a security camera

00:07.355 --> 00:08.878
pointed towards
the bike rack?

00:08.921 --> 00:11.011
No. Our camera is pointed
at the drop-off line

00:11.054 --> 00:12.838
so I can see
which dads have nice cars.

00:12.882 --> 00:15.667
Why?
A bike has gone missing.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.147
Who would steal
a child's bike?

00:17.191 --> 00:19.715
Well, maybe not a child's,
but an adult's.

00:19.758 --> 00:21.325
Your bike got stolen?

00:23.806 --> 00:28.767
I saw an unfamiliar man milling
about the rack this morning.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.856
Okay, well,
what did he look like?

00:34.208 --> 00:37.689
U-Uh, I would say he had a,
you know,

00:37.733 --> 00:41.693
somewhat curly
and spherical haircut.

00:41.737 --> 00:42.955
An afro?

00:42.999 --> 00:44.261
It was--
Some might call it--

00:44.305 --> 00:45.784
You know what,
this feels reductive.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.873
No, no, no! No,
let's get to the bottom of this.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.353
Would you describe
this person

00:49.397 --> 00:52.530
as someone who might
have difficulty getting a loan?

00:52.574 --> 00:54.097
You know what? It's fine.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.230
Was it really ever my bike, anyways?

00:56.273 --> 00:59.102
You know, does anyone
really own anything?

00:59.146 --> 01:03.715
I will, uh, leave you
to ponder that query,

01:03.759 --> 01:06.979
and, uh, adieu.

01:08.764 --> 01:10.809
I suppose I won't
be needing this.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.437
After reading the material
and looking at the data

01:29.480 --> 01:31.091
from the past five years,

01:31.134 --> 01:32.614
I have to agree with the
nutritional board of Missouri

01:32.657 --> 01:34.572
that small changes
like a beverage

01:34.616 --> 01:36.487
can lead to seismic shifts.

01:36.531 --> 01:38.141
Guys, this juice
is the future.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.838
You don't need to stand
when you talk.

01:39.882 --> 01:43.146
You don't need
to talk, period.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.930
Once a year,
the lunch crew has a meeting

01:44.974 --> 01:47.585
to discuss new menu options
from the school district.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.413
This year it was about juice.

01:49.457 --> 01:52.112
Now, the meeting is technically
open to all staff,

01:52.155 --> 01:53.939
but most teachers
take the hint

01:53.983 --> 01:56.333
and leave it
to the professionals.

01:56.377 --> 01:59.771
One teacher wouldn't know a hint
if it closed a door in her face.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.251
Twice.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.862
You guys missed
a great lunch committee meeting.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.473
They don't want
teachers there.

02:05.516 --> 02:08.519
Oh, so they just say "all
are welcome" as a formality?

02:08.563 --> 02:10.130
Yeah, right.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.610
Oh, God. Anyway, someone had
to get the scoop

02:12.654 --> 02:14.482
on this hot new juice.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.527
It's two more ounces than the
juice the kids are drinking now

02:16.571 --> 02:18.964
and five percent
more real juice.

02:19.008 --> 02:20.227
That's 10 percent
more juice.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.838
Okay, math!
Yes, it's less sugar.

02:22.881 --> 02:24.361
It's better all around.

02:24.405 --> 02:26.494
It's a really easy low-lift win
for our kids.

02:26.537 --> 02:27.799
So what do you guys think?

02:27.843 --> 02:29.149
- Less sugar is compelling.
- Mm-hmm.

02:29.192 --> 02:30.498
I'm not really
a big fan of juice.

02:30.541 --> 02:32.456
I prefer nature's juice--

02:32.500 --> 02:34.632
water.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.678
What do you think, Barbara?

02:36.721 --> 02:39.463
I say no.
The kids aren't complaining.

02:39.507 --> 02:42.292
If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.511
I'm with Barbara.

02:43.554 --> 02:44.990
Okay, well, I'm for it,

02:45.034 --> 02:46.470
but I would love
to discuss further.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.820
I have been here a long time, Janine.

02:48.864 --> 02:49.952
Trust me.

02:49.995 --> 02:52.172
New projects
mean new problems.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.564
Mm-hmm.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.653
What problems could there
possibly be?

02:55.697 --> 02:57.351
"Oh, no, help me.
I'm hurting...

02:57.394 --> 02:59.222
from getting too much
of my daily recommended

02:59.266 --> 03:00.484
fruit servings.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.835
There's no downside here.

03:03.879 --> 03:06.011
It seems like you have
made up your mind.

03:06.055 --> 03:09.319
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got to go teach my children

03:09.363 --> 03:12.670
what happens
if you give a moose a muffin.

03:12.714 --> 03:14.237
It does not end well.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.934
New juice it is.

03:15.978 --> 03:19.242
Okay, so if you have a dollar,
and your brother,

03:19.286 --> 03:20.678
who already owes you 10 grand

03:20.722 --> 03:22.593
'cause he keeps
backing the Jets,

03:22.637 --> 03:25.205
wants to borrow 75 cents...

03:25.248 --> 03:26.423
Where are my quarters?

03:26.467 --> 03:27.685
Whoo!

03:29.905 --> 03:32.342
Ashley Garcia,
Frankford, Philly.

03:32.386 --> 03:35.693
Old enough to know better,
young enough to sheesh.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.391
And I'm here at Abbott
as an aide

03:37.434 --> 03:39.088
'cause I'm helpful as hell.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.351
That's why I've been at
four schools in four months.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.266
'Cause everyone wants
a piece.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.050
Hey, are those mine?

03:45.094 --> 03:46.704
Hey, you want
your own quarters,

03:46.748 --> 03:48.271
date your own
vending machine guy.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.709
I'm using them for my
science lesson on momentum.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.711
Oh! If it's heads,
I get to keep it.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.322
It's tails.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.721
Would you look at this?
The kids love it,

04:03.765 --> 04:05.723
and the juice
is flying off the trays.

04:05.767 --> 04:08.900
Yeah, maybe next year
we could get real meat.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.772
Mmm.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.122
Mm.
What's that I taste?

04:13.165 --> 04:16.256
Is that the nectar
of sweet victory?

04:16.299 --> 04:18.388
Yeah, the kids are having
more juice,

04:18.432 --> 04:20.912
but less sugar,
and they seem very happy.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.480
That's nice, dear.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.265
You gotta admit this was
a good idea.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.397
You know, your kids
are probably loving it.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.269
Well, I guess
we'll never know

04:29.312 --> 04:32.837
because I did not opt in
for this juice.

04:32.881 --> 04:34.274
Why not?

04:34.317 --> 04:36.014
Because my class will be
sticking with the juice

04:36.058 --> 04:39.453
that has been working
for the past 20 years.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.759
If it ain't broke,
don't fix it.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.108
All right, you know what?
I think they should change

04:43.152 --> 04:45.285
that phrase to
"If it ain't broke,

04:45.328 --> 04:47.112
do fix it sometimes

04:47.156 --> 04:48.505
because it might
make it better."

04:48.549 --> 04:51.334
So you want to fix
an unbroken phrase

04:51.378 --> 04:54.337
that has been used
effectively for generations?

04:54.381 --> 04:57.297
If it makes it better,
then yes.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.429
Ugh.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.431
Don't worry.
Chapter books will be a breeze.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.433
Most books are based
off movies anyway,

05:03.477 --> 05:04.521
so you can watch
instead of--

05:04.565 --> 05:07.698
No, no! No.

05:07.742 --> 05:11.311
Ashley is more easily distracted
than my second graders.

05:11.354 --> 05:12.790
But I got a plan.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.010
I figure if we organize
her work, it'd help,

05:15.053 --> 05:17.360
so I made her a to-do list,

05:17.404 --> 05:19.623
which is different
from my to-do list,

05:19.667 --> 05:22.191
which includes
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.975
Or Jon "The Rock" Bon Jovi.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.717
Yeah, so where are youse
on that checklist?

05:26.761 --> 05:28.023
Oh.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.807
Ashley.
Checklist.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.505
Oh, you meant me?

05:31.548 --> 05:32.854
Right. Good! Great.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.551
I mean, I lost it.
Of course.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.379
Okay, so you're supposed
to be working on words

05:36.423 --> 05:39.991
with H's after P's.
'Kay?

05:40.035 --> 05:42.559
H's after D's?
That's weird.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.561
No. H's after P.

05:44.605 --> 05:47.695
P.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.349
You said pee-pee.

05:52.264 --> 05:55.224
Hot, right?
So this is vintage 2019 Zara,

05:55.267 --> 05:58.488
previously loved. I'm gonna
start this listing at $20.

05:58.532 --> 06:00.360
Okay, I see you @moolahbaybee.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.839
Can I get $25?

06:01.883 --> 06:04.059
Ava, it's urgent.

06:04.102 --> 06:05.843
Okay, sold to
@moolahbaybee.

06:05.887 --> 06:09.847
You better count your blessings,
fan, 'cause this is a steal.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.415
Okay, y'all, I gotta run.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.025
Remember, my live pop-up sales
only happen

06:14.069 --> 06:16.201
Monday through Friday,
9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m...

06:16.245 --> 06:17.855
Otherwise, I'm pretty busy.

06:17.899 --> 06:19.204
Peace.

06:19.248 --> 06:21.381
Administrative business.
What's going on?

06:21.424 --> 06:22.860
Ashley's gotta go.
Who?

06:22.904 --> 06:25.036
My new aide.
I want her gone.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.516
Oh, what exactly
is the problem?

06:26.560 --> 06:27.691
She's giving me agita.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.127
We can't fire people
for that.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.694
I tried to get Jacob fired
his first year

06:30.738 --> 06:33.044
for buying me a reusable
water bottle for Christmas.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.481
I found it passive aggressive.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.527
And yet he's still here.

06:37.571 --> 06:39.224
You gotta have a paper trail
of bad behavior.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.487
This is a bureaucracy.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.053
Yeah, but she's a huge pain
in my ass.

06:42.097 --> 06:44.055
I'm actually getting less work
done with her here.

06:44.099 --> 06:45.535
Okay, damn.
I'll come to your class

06:45.579 --> 06:47.102
and monitor her myself.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.886
- You will?
- Yes!

06:48.930 --> 06:50.714
Why does everybody get so
surprised when I say I'll help?

06:50.758 --> 06:52.063
I'm a professional.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.717
No, that's--
that's great.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.937
Thank you.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.331
Now, what does one wear
to monitor?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.333
Three-ninths is complicated.

07:01.377 --> 07:02.726
A little full of itself.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.467
It's not my favorite,
but some people--

07:04.511 --> 07:07.252
Oh. Kalan, Armonni,
welcome back.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.646
You took so long I thought
you fell in the toilet,

07:09.690 --> 07:11.082
but now it's time to fall

07:11.126 --> 07:12.649
into the wonderful world
of fractions.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.435
I have to go to the bathroom,
too, Miss Teagues.

07:15.478 --> 07:19.743
Okay, um, who else needs
to go to the bathroom?

07:19.787 --> 07:22.267
Well, looks like
I need to go, too,

07:22.311 --> 07:24.922
so I guess it's time
to take a little field trip.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.274
Dang, this line is longer
than Saweetie's nails.

07:29.318 --> 07:30.754
Is there some kind of
free-before-ten special

07:30.798 --> 07:32.103
going on that
I don't know about?

07:32.147 --> 07:33.365
We've been in line
for 15 minutes.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.019
It's been like this
all day.

07:35.063 --> 07:36.673
Has it?
That's wild.

07:36.717 --> 07:38.283
'Cause I've been so busy
working, you know,

07:38.327 --> 07:39.589
I didn't notice.

07:39.633 --> 07:42.026
Whoa, I thought it was
just my class.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.201
What is going on?

07:43.245 --> 07:44.594
It's this new juice.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.030
It's busting their bladders.

07:46.074 --> 07:47.510
Oh, but that can't be it.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.120
I mean, it's only
two more ounces.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.471
Well, I guess two more ounces
adds up to 200 more trips

07:51.514 --> 07:54.299
to the bathroom.

07:54.343 --> 07:55.866
Well, this is a good thing

07:55.910 --> 07:57.999
because more trips
to the bathroom

07:58.042 --> 08:00.828
means more liquid flushing
through their tiny bodies

08:00.871 --> 08:03.352
and cleansing
their tiny little cells.

08:03.395 --> 08:04.614
Hydration.

08:04.658 --> 08:07.051
This is good. Mm.

08:10.228 --> 08:13.188
Uh-oh.
I think the bathroom broke.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.151
All the first floor bathrooms
are broken.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.544
Until reinforcements arrive,

08:21.588 --> 08:23.894
everyone has to use
the upstairs bathroom.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.331
And I pray to
the Mario Brothers they hold.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.552
If I didn't have so much class,
I'd say "I told you so."

08:29.596 --> 08:33.034
Ugh! You did not tell me
that changing juices

08:33.077 --> 08:34.557
would make the kids
drink so much

08:34.601 --> 08:35.863
that they peed the bathrooms
out of commission.

08:35.906 --> 08:37.517
I told you that there was
no need

08:37.560 --> 08:39.519
to fix something
that wasn't broken.

08:39.562 --> 08:42.391
But no, that wasn't enough
for Janine.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.175
You should have just
listened to me.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.916
How are we even supposed
to teach?

08:45.960 --> 08:48.005
My first graders have never even
been to the second floor before.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.529
And it takes me 45 seconds

08:49.572 --> 08:51.008
at a brisk pace
to get all the way up there.

08:51.052 --> 08:53.010
It will take the kids forever.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.056
You time yourself going
to the second floor?

08:55.099 --> 08:56.753
- You don't?
- Uh, while I admit

08:56.797 --> 08:58.712
this is an unfortunate circumstance,

08:58.755 --> 09:01.018
it will be nice to have
some extra pairs of feet

09:01.062 --> 09:03.020
up in the penthouses.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.196
That's what we non-ground floor
teachers call it.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.676
Wait, Barbara, is your
kindergarten bathroom

09:06.720 --> 09:09.853
still working?

09:09.897 --> 09:12.943
Yes, my private facilities
are intact,

09:12.987 --> 09:16.686
due to my responsible
juice decision.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.470
Can our kids use it,
Barbara?

09:18.514 --> 09:20.211
Please? It's a close call
getting them

09:20.255 --> 09:21.778
to the first floor bathroom
as it is.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.606
And first graders have

09:23.650 --> 09:25.913
the second most combustible
- bladders.
- Okay, fine.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.611
The kindergarten bathroom
may be used in emergencies.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.439
Oh, thank goodness.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.701
I meant the kids.

09:31.745 --> 09:32.876
I'm a kid at heart.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.312
You--

09:34.356 --> 09:36.271
Thank you.
Thank you.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.490
- Your lipstick... pretty.
- Those pants are creased
real well.

09:38.534 --> 09:42.407
Okay, kids. How many yards are
in one Manute Bol?

09:42.451 --> 09:44.409
Jessica.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.628
Three?

09:45.672 --> 09:47.412
Not quite.
Anybody else?

09:47.456 --> 09:51.503
I'm Meg Thee Skeleton and it's
time to learn about our bones.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.332
Eh!

09:54.376 --> 09:56.465
Good news is, now that I have
Ashley helping out in my class,

09:56.508 --> 09:58.075
I can teach two lessons at once.

09:58.119 --> 10:01.644
Bad news is, I now have
Ashley in my class.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.343
How y'all doing?
Don't worry about me.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.128
I'm not even here.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.478
Alright. So, um--I'm here to teach you
about the human...

10:09.521 --> 10:12.133
♪ Body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody

10:12.176 --> 10:15.092
♪ Bones, blood, meat, you! Okay.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.920
Hey. Hi, my class.

10:16.964 --> 10:19.140
You guys would know this
if you did your homework.

10:19.183 --> 10:21.621
Hello. Right up here, guys.
Right up here.

10:21.664 --> 10:24.536
- Girl, is that my shirt?
- Oh, this?

10:24.580 --> 10:26.538
I got it off a popular
Depop page.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.932
@AvaFlaaaaaaaaaav
with 10 A's?

10:28.976 --> 10:30.934
Oh, my God.
That's you?

10:30.978 --> 10:32.283
I love your clothes.

10:32.327 --> 10:34.677
Thank you.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.157
I closed that account down
for tax reasons,

10:36.200 --> 10:38.115
but I do live auctions now.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.465
Here, scan this QR code
and hit follow,

10:40.509 --> 10:41.771
and make sure you turn
on the notifications

10:41.815 --> 10:42.772
so you don't miss anything.

10:42.816 --> 10:43.947
The good stuff goes fast.

10:43.991 --> 10:45.645
Oh, my gosh.
That's so smart.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.125
You know, way better than
some piece of paper I'd lose.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.387
Business cards are for gum, girl.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.998
This is the future. Yes.

10:51.041 --> 10:54.654
Okay, how many feet
are in a yard?

10:54.697 --> 10:56.699
Melissa, do you mind?

10:56.743 --> 10:58.962
We talking business
back here.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.703
Okay, here's another one.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.488
If I were to break
this yard stick in half

11:03.532 --> 11:06.317
out of anger,
how long would each piece be?

11:06.361 --> 11:09.843
The human...
♪ Body-ody-ody-ody-ody

11:11.061 --> 11:14.151
♪ Bones, blood, meat, you

11:15.718 --> 11:19.026
What clothes do we wear
in the winter time?

11:20.375 --> 11:21.550
- Coat!
- Mittens!
- Pajamas!

11:21.593 --> 11:22.812
Very good.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.990
Hi, Keta. Hi, Hayley.
Hi, Fred.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.731
I'm sorry, Mrs. Howard.
We'll be quick.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.255
Come on.

11:31.299 --> 11:32.692
All right, now.

11:32.735 --> 11:35.607
And in what seasons
do we wear--

11:36.739 --> 11:39.524
Sorry, Mrs. Howard.

11:39.568 --> 11:43.093
In what seasons
do we wear pajamas?

11:43.137 --> 11:45.705
My pajamas
have racecars on them!

11:45.748 --> 11:46.923
Yes.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.185
Bathroom's over there.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.534
Oh, thanks, girl.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.407
Buddy system.

11:54.801 --> 11:58.630
Pajamas are actually
year-round attire.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.763
Mrs. Howard,
I have to go potty.

12:00.807 --> 12:01.938
All right.
Get in line.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.462
But it's a memergency.

12:04.506 --> 12:06.247
Well, come on.
Come on.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.379
Let's go.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.251
Hey! No cutting!

12:10.294 --> 12:13.036
Excuse me.
My children are kindergartners

12:13.080 --> 12:15.299
and they need the bathroom
more than anyone.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.780
Not more than me.
I had 10 juices.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.216
You know what?

12:19.260 --> 12:20.870
From now on, you all need
to use the bathroom

12:20.914 --> 12:22.785
on the second floor.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.091
But, Mrs. Howard,
that's not fair.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.570
You know what's not fair?

12:25.614 --> 12:29.400
My children having to pay
for your juice mistakes.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.490
Now, please get out.

12:32.534 --> 12:34.057
- That way!
- Okay.

12:34.101 --> 12:35.624
C-Come on. Sorry.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.757
You trippin'.
Ashley is a star.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.149
I'm trying to run
a classroom,

12:39.193 --> 12:41.412
and she's actively
working against that.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.979
I can't even hear myself think
over the kids

12:43.023 --> 12:45.329
singing body-wody-whatever.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.288
See, that's not even
how the song goes.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.898
I thought you was
one of them spicy Whites.

12:48.942 --> 12:49.986
I hate being wrong.

12:50.030 --> 12:51.901
Ava, she is a menace.

12:51.945 --> 12:55.252
She painted eyeballs on her lids
so she could nap during class.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.254
Ava!

12:57.298 --> 12:59.300
She's supposed to be
prepping right now during lunch.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.649
I don't even know
where she is.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.912
No. She's perfect.
Like a little mini-me.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.914
Hold on.

13:04.958 --> 13:08.091
Ashley, make a note in my
Halloween costumes ideas folder

13:08.135 --> 13:10.920
for a Mini-Me
and a sexy Dr. Evil.

13:10.964 --> 13:13.140
-<i>Copy.
- Ashley.</i>

13:13.183 --> 13:14.794
Where are you?

13:14.837 --> 13:17.144
<i>Getting water for
Ava's clothes steamer.</i>

13:17.187 --> 13:18.798
She wanted
to steam them.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.452
Can you go back to prepping
in my classroom, please?

13:21.496 --> 13:23.454
<i>Okay, you're kinda throwing
a lot at me here.</i>

13:23.498 --> 13:26.806
Ashley, go back
to my classroom.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.809
What?
I already did my prep.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.288
I do it while I'm teaching.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.813
I call it preaching.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.945
- Single file.
- Just line up right here.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.512
All right?
Bathroom?

13:37.555 --> 13:39.383
Yeah.
This is so inconvenient,

13:39.427 --> 13:41.124
I can barely find
a silver lining.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.212
You found one?

13:42.256 --> 13:43.605
We're getting
good exercise.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.650
It don't count
if I don't got my FitBit on.

13:45.694 --> 13:48.523
We cannot be expected to keep
hauling our entire classes

13:48.566 --> 13:51.308
up the stairs
every five seconds.

13:51.352 --> 13:52.570
We would help Barbara
if she needed it, right?

13:52.614 --> 13:54.834
Yeah. Absolutely.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.140
Because it is her free period
right now.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.321
And it's not like we'd be
disrupting her class.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.975
Right?
And I bet if I asked her,

14:06.019 --> 14:08.064
she'd want us
to use her bathroom.

14:09.718 --> 14:10.850
Come on kids.
Yeah, right.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.199
- Let's be quiet.
- Everyone, shhh.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.331
Get low. Well, really,
just Mr. Eddie get low.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.768
Get low. Get low.
Okay, come on.

14:17.726 --> 14:19.380
What's taking
that kid so long?

14:19.423 --> 14:20.990
Who's even in there?

14:21.034 --> 14:24.559
Um, everything okay?

14:24.602 --> 14:25.865
You know, Gregory,
you try it.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.692
I've been told
I knock like a ghost.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.346
Could y-- I know.
Just--

14:33.046 --> 14:34.874
Hi, Mrs. Howard.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.226
I distinctly remember
telling both of you

14:39.269 --> 14:41.706
that my bathroom
was off limits.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.360
Yes. Yes.
But then I remembered

14:43.404 --> 14:45.275
how if you needed help,
I would give it to you.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.625
And that's lovely,
but I said no.

14:47.669 --> 14:48.931
Barbara, look,
it's your free period.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.193
Your kids are at the gym.

14:50.237 --> 14:52.456
I don't care
what period it is.

14:52.500 --> 14:56.634
I said no, and I do not need
to explain my reasoning to you.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.550
When I say something, that is
the end of the discussion.

14:59.594 --> 15:05.034
There is a period at the end
of each of my sentences.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.036
That felt like
an exclamation point.
Mnh-mnh.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.603
I'm sorry.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.779
Barbara, we are sorry,
but we will be done in a minute.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.389
The kids will be out,
and it will be like

15:12.433 --> 15:13.651
we were ever here.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.396
I think it's broken.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.664
Man, this is messier
than Temple Homecoming '74.

15:26.708 --> 15:27.927
The kindergarten toilet
somehow took out

15:27.970 --> 15:29.319
all the second floor
toilets with it.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.278
Third floor bathroom
is all we got now.

15:31.321 --> 15:32.932
And I just got off the phone
with the city.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.978
They said they can't do
anything until next week.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.762
Thank you, Janine.

15:37.806 --> 15:41.244
I was hoping I could take
my entire class

15:41.288 --> 15:44.073
up and down the stairs
all day long.

15:44.117 --> 15:47.511
And since one of my students
can't use the stairs,

15:47.555 --> 15:50.950
I'll have to drop Johnny off
with another teacher.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.342
Thank you.

15:53.822 --> 15:55.955
Ah! Yeah.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.174
You know, when you think
about it, "Grindin'" by Clipse

15:58.218 --> 16:00.002
was kind of
the original Cup Song.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.264
Mm. Oh, my God.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.179
I never thought about it
like that.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.529
Anna Kendrick
is such a fraud!

16:07.488 --> 16:09.011
Oh, hi, Ashley.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.318
Glad to see you hard
at not-work.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.842
I'm sure you finished that
to-do list I gave you?

16:13.885 --> 16:15.626
Nar.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.499
But I did write it all down
in my Notes app this time.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.848
I'll get right on it.

16:19.891 --> 16:23.286
Jacob, more on
Anna Kendrick later.

16:24.331 --> 16:26.202
Ava, status update.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.204
All orders have been packaged
for shipping.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.163
Oh, never thought the district
would send someone

16:30.206 --> 16:31.816
so enterprising.

16:31.860 --> 16:32.992
Thank you.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.389
I haven't seen you this mad
since the bartender cut you off

16:39.433 --> 16:41.826
at the batting cages.

16:41.870 --> 16:44.046
I can't get this girl
to put caps back on markers,

16:44.090 --> 16:48.050
and here she is helping Ava run
an entire pyramid scheme.

16:48.094 --> 16:51.314
Just tossing it out there,
feel free to toss it right back,

16:51.358 --> 16:56.058
but maybe it's because
Ava actually engages with her.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.495
This is a job.
It's not a meet and greet.

16:58.539 --> 17:02.064
I'm just saying, it might help
if you got to know her.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.544
Or-- Or, you know,
carry on as is.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.154
Whatever you--
whatever you like.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.200
Let's get in line.
Thank you.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.294
Air is thin up here
on the third floor.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.557
Mm-hmm.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.862
Barbara,
I owe you an apology

17:17.906 --> 17:19.168
just as s-soon
as I catch my breath.

17:19.212 --> 17:20.256
Mm-hmm.

17:20.300 --> 17:21.823
Thank you.

17:21.866 --> 17:24.086
I know you didn't mean
to ruin my day, Janine.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.522
But I did.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.089
You did.

17:27.133 --> 17:30.701
I tried to tell you no,
but you wouldn't listen.

17:30.745 --> 17:35.967
All day long I have 5-year-olds
asking me why this, why that.

17:36.011 --> 17:39.710
I do not have the time
for a bunch of 20-somethings

17:39.754 --> 17:40.885
doing the same thing.

17:40.929 --> 17:43.366
I hear you. I do.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.629
But, Barbara, we need
to know the why.

17:45.673 --> 17:46.978
If you just tell us
the answer,

17:47.022 --> 17:50.069
we'll never learn how
to solve the problems.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.983
We need you to show
your work, too.

17:52.027 --> 17:53.463
Look, when you were first
starting out,

17:53.507 --> 17:54.856
didn't you have someone
who, like,

17:54.899 --> 17:56.118
walked you through everything

17:56.162 --> 17:57.728
and showed you
the tricks of the trade?

17:57.772 --> 18:00.253
I did not.

18:00.296 --> 18:04.387
Oh. Okay.

18:04.431 --> 18:06.781
I can't believe that
they won't come out for a week

18:06.824 --> 18:09.610
just because we have
one working bathroom left.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.742
Phew.

18:11.786 --> 18:16.007
Janine, now is when
you fix something.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.966
When it's broken.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.576
You see how that works?

18:19.620 --> 18:22.231
I mean [chuckles] yeah,
unless you're the city.

18:22.275 --> 18:25.930
I will be right back.
Watch my class. Thank you.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.149
Excuse me.

18:30.631 --> 18:33.329
So, uh, what's
this little number called?

18:33.373 --> 18:35.636
Oh, the "Grindin'" beat.
My older sister taught it to me.

18:35.679 --> 18:38.117
Kids love it.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.944
It's kinda like
the Cup Song.

18:39.988 --> 18:42.425
Oh, we have so much
to discuss.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.168
♪ Signing

18:48.649 --> 18:49.911
Wanna try?

18:49.954 --> 18:51.347
Yeah, you know what,
I'm good for now.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.870
But how about this?
How about we make time

18:52.914 --> 18:54.481
for you to teach
something cool like this

18:54.524 --> 18:55.786
to the kids every week?
'Cause they're loving it.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.310
Really?
Absolutely.

18:57.353 --> 18:58.833
And for now, why don't you
start grindin' away

18:58.876 --> 19:00.139
on that math test?

19:00.182 --> 19:02.184
Can do, boss.
All right.

19:02.228 --> 19:04.795
Melissa, I need
your baseball bat.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.362
- Taped under my desk.
- Mm-hmm.

19:06.406 --> 19:08.364
Oh, wipe it down
- when you're done.
- Got it.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.801
Wait, can I get
a baseball bat?

19:10.845 --> 19:12.368
When you're older.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.980
Come on, guys.
Good job washing your hands.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.286
Go sit down
on the stairs.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.983
Who else has to go?
Come on up--

19:19.027 --> 19:20.333
Whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa!

19:20.376 --> 19:21.812
- We're sorry. We're sorry.
- Barbara, what?!

19:21.856 --> 19:23.988
Did everyone get a chance
to use the bathroom?

19:24.032 --> 19:25.164
I pooped.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.643
That's great, sweetheart.

19:28.428 --> 19:29.994
Um, okay...
Come on, y'all.
Let's take a step back.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.693
Everybody step behind me.
Just stand behind me.

19:32.736 --> 19:34.303
- Just... behind us.
- Come on.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.916
Oh, my God.

19:42.877 --> 19:45.009
Whew.

19:45.053 --> 19:49.840
Well, this bathroom
is out of commission.

19:49.884 --> 19:52.843
We will have to inform
the district that our situation

19:52.887 --> 19:57.370
is now
officially an emergency.

19:57.413 --> 20:00.024
Barbara! This is why I always
want to meet up

20:00.068 --> 20:01.461
with you
and talk things out,

20:01.504 --> 20:03.680
because you know how
to handle every situation.

20:03.724 --> 20:06.335
And clearly, I do not.

20:06.379 --> 20:09.251
Well, I didn't have anybody
to show me the ropes.

20:09.295 --> 20:12.254
You were right.
It would have been a big help.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.213
Why don't I set aside
some time

20:14.256 --> 20:18.260
so anyone wanting to know
how I handled a situation

20:18.304 --> 20:21.437
and why can come--Build community.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.091
Talk to me.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.919
- Like office hours.
- Office hour.

20:24.962 --> 20:28.879
- Got it. Once a week.
- Once a month.

20:28.923 --> 20:32.709
Deal.

20:32.753 --> 20:34.885
I have one thing
to ask in return.

20:34.929 --> 20:35.886
Yeah?

20:35.930 --> 20:37.279
Get rid of this for me.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.628
Oh, um...
Thank you.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.543
I don't wanna...
Come on.

20:40.587 --> 20:41.936
- ...be a part of... this.
- Come on. Let's go, class.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.071
I had to go over
to the corner store

20:47.115 --> 20:48.769
and they wouldn't give me
the bathroom code

20:48.812 --> 20:51.293
without a purchase, so
I panic-bought some scratchers.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.557
Come on, early retirement.

20:54.601 --> 20:57.256
Yeah, same.
So terrible.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.562
Couldn't pee anywhere
all day.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.303
It was bananas.

21:10.312 --> 21:11.400
I know y'all didn't think
I was using them

21:11.444 --> 21:13.141
little kiddie toilets up there.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.756
Unh-unh.
No cameras in the bathroom.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.280
But if you're wondering
if I have a bidet,

21:21.323 --> 21:22.672
you bet I bi-do.
