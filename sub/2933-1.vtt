don't give me the money?

11:43.285 --> 11:45.370
What if they check the drive, just like I did?

11:46.414 --> 11:47.455
Oh.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.541
Well, the real one's hidden.

11:49.625 --> 11:52.293
It's in a safe place where no one will
ever look, so don't worry about it.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.753
You idiot. Where is it?

11:53.838 --> 11:55.839
Where's my witness protection plan?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.091
It's gonna be in a casket if you
don't tell me where it is.

12:05.641 --> 12:06.725
I got a buddy who works there.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.109
(SIGHS) Canetti brought a dummy flash.

12:16.485 --> 12:19.487
Yeah, well, he told me where the
real one is, but there's no time.

12:20.156 --> 12:24.200
We're just gonna have to get Chirkoff
to make the exchange. Yeah.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.618
All right.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.954
Hey. Let's go.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.889
Canetti, can you hear me?

13:27.973 --> 13:29.474
Yeah, I got you, Chocolate. Go ahead.

13:29.558 --> 13:32.185
Look, if anything goes wrong, get out of there.

13:36.524 --> 13:40.026
Hey, fellas. Vlad and Dmitri, right?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.159

14:11.267 --> 14:13.184
No, I think you're probably a very intelligent man.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.435

14:14.520 --> 14:16.312

I'm not talking to you.

I'm talking to the people on

Get out of the car and hide, now! What's going on?

I'm a little hard of hearing in my right ear.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.503

that guy right in front of me.

We're still here, all right? That's what matters.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.216
Shouldn't we call the FBI or something?

16:50.300 --> 16:53.428
No. FBI has got a leak. Chirkoff knew we were coming.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.054
Malcolm, I want to go home, man.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.764
Trent. Your car's back there.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.349
They probably already ran your tags.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.767
They know everything about us.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.686
You just saw Chirkoff murder someone.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.521
We can't go home. So, what, then?

17:03.605 --> 17:05.356
That means he's gonna kill me?

17:05.441 --> 17:07.191
Oh, come on! That is not hot.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.862
I won't let him. All right? All I got
to do is get that flash drive.

17:10.945 --> 17:13.698
It has enough dirt on Chirkoff to put him away forever.

17:13.781 --> 17:15.407
Payoff, hits, everything.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.492

Just calm down, all right? Relax.
Take a soothing breath.

have no idea where they are.

flash drive in 3-inch heels.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.151
Canetti had a buddy who works here.

20:37.319 --> 20:40.821
We start by finding out who that
is, and what they know.

Canetti.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.742
Canetti, yeah.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.203
Canetti said something to me right before he died.

20:47.287 --> 20:49.538
He looked at me and he said...

20:51.291 --> 20:52.583
What'd he say?

knew who the Prodi-G was.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.850
That's not the half!

22:34.519 --> 22:36.354
Damn!

22:37.397 --> 22:40.316

can still do a comb over.

No, Beverly, you promised us two weeks' notice.

22:44.154 --> 22:48.407

respect, you die just a little.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.118
You die a little.

22:51.203 --> 22:55.373

living with those demon spawn!

23:13.683 --> 23:15.393
Oh, don't worry about that.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.228
Shoot, I grew up so poor,

23:17.312 --> 23:19.146
we used to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken

23:19.231 --> 23:20.731
and lick other people's fingers.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.650
Because we couldn't afford the chicken.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.820
And you know, all the grease from
the chicken, we were like...

23:25.904 --> 23:29.865
You know, there is one tiny little issue.

23:30.742 --> 23:31.867
What's that?

23:32.661 --> 23:35.246
Hey. What up?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.672
Hello. Hey.

23:44.881 --> 23:48.092
So many girls! I feel like I'm at a Baskin-Robbins.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.052
A festival of flavors!

23:51.680 --> 23:55.182
(CLEARS THROAT) I mean, um, it's so diverse here.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.978
Ah, yes. Well, we do pride ourselves on diversity.

23:59.521 --> 24:03.983
So tell me, Charmaine, do you think
that you're a good fit for GGSA?

24:04.067 --> 24:07.695
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mmm-hmm. I like to read.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.157
And, uh, I like to, uh,

24:11.241 --> 24:12.658
play music.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.494
And I like salad.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.582
Sweet, delicious, fresh fruit salad.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.919
She's had a stressful few days.

24:24.004 --> 24:27.131
She's only with me because of some family problems.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.717
Mmm-hmm. My parents don't support my art.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.135
They think it's a waste of time.

24:31.219 --> 24:35.097
Oh, dear, that is awful. Well, you
have come to the right place.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.308
And my stepfather's always working.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.268
He has an important job in the government.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.145
Which he uses to spy on me.

24:41.229 --> 24:43.939
Ever told the truth, wouldn't have to.

24:46.943 --> 24:50.029
Charmaine, you can audit classes
until your transcripts get here,

24:50.113 --> 24:51.822
but I'm afraid, since it's the end of the year,

24:51.907 --> 24:53.407
we don't have a roommate for you.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.284
Oh, any ol' girl will do.

24:55.368 --> 24:57.244
Oh, no. We don't want to put you out.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.747
Charmaine'll just stay with her Big Momma.

24:59.831 --> 25:03.667
But my shrink in juvie said I'd do better
with a role model my own age.

25:03.752 --> 25:05.503
You'll be on the same floor as your peers.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.837
Before you know it, you'll be bosom buddies.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.590
(GASPS) Charmaine likes the sound of that!

25:17.390 --> 25:19.433
GAIL: Welcome to your new home.

25:19.809 --> 25:21.644
I'll just show you to your room.

25:21.728 --> 25:23.354
Some of the girls have gone to dinner,

25:23.438 --> 25:24.980
so you'll just see them there.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.023
Okay.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.483
Oh, there's Mia! Mia.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.152
(GASPS) Damn!

25:32.030 --> 25:35.115
Mia, this is your new house mother, Big Momma,

25:35.200 --> 25:37.701
and this is her niece, Charmaine, your new classmate.

25:37.786 --> 25:38.786
Hi.

25:38.870 --> 25:41.121
Mia is a very promising young actress.

25:41.373 --> 25:45.459
Oh, I'm okay. I mean, I can do light
comedy, like Sandra Bullock.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.670
Well, you know, before the Oscar.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.713
But I really need to work on expanding my range,

25:49.798 --> 25:51.340
in the way that Kate Winslet does.

25:51.424 --> 25:54.051
And Mrs. Orth from Movement says that
I need to listen to my inner voice,

25:54.135 --> 25:55.553
but there's just so many of them,

25:55.637 --> 25:59.390
and the loudest one's always screaming,
"Delanté's pulling away!"

25:59.474 --> 26:00.891
My God! Delanté's pulling away.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.353
I think I should go now.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.938
Girl, you need a hug!

26:07.816 --> 26:10.484
She gets a little emotional. Who the hell is Delanté?

26:10.777 --> 26:12.820
Delanté is the boyfriend.

26:13.029 --> 26:14.196
Oh.

26:15.490 --> 26:18.659
Gail, maybe we should freshen up before dinner.

26:19.077 --> 26:22.580
All this transition is a bit much for Charmaine.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.748
She should probably rest her eyes

26:24.833 --> 26:27.585
or become unconscious for a moment or two.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.838
I totally understand. Your room
is at the end of the hall.

26:32.757 --> 26:35.634
Well, look at the wallpaper! It's so nice!

26:37.596 --> 26:40.681
Look. There's a ballerina on the bed.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.766
I'm Jasmine.

26:43.351 --> 26:46.895
And here's the 411 you probably
didn't get on your tour.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.814
I call the shots around here.

26:48.898 --> 26:49.940
So, if you two stay out of the way,

26:50.025 --> 26:51.567
we shouldn't have any problems.

26:51.651 --> 26:52.818
Okay?

26:53.612 --> 26:57.656
Now you listen to me, Tinker Bell.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.743
Big Momma don't take orders from nobody.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.494
Nobody.

27:04.539 --> 27:06.332
We'll see about that.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.379
Towel girl was nice.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.215
I'm going to unpack.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.819
You mind? Do you mind?

27:36.571 --> 27:40.491
Ooh. Sit down with such lovely young ladies.

27:52.837 --> 27:53.879

28:17.404 --> 28:19.822
(CLEARS THROAT) I mean, you're not hot.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.575
(STUTTERING) The Promenade
was hot the day I saw you.

28:24.619 --> 28:27.204
I'm not saying you're not hot,

28:27.622 --> 28:30.541
but it was hot at the Promenade
the day I saw you being hot.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.042

formally get to introduce myself.

28:55.358 --> 29:00.195
My name is Hattie Mae Pierce, but
everyone calls me Big Momma.

to do something before you eat.

Thank you. I have an announcement.

35:58.364 --> 36:00.574
Last night, an antique music box was stolen

36:00.658 --> 36:02.659
from our library's special collection.

36:03.244 --> 36:06.037
Now, I know we have a tradition of pranks.

36:06.539 --> 36:10.417
But this is not stealing the mascot
from the boys at St. Ignatius.

36:10.877 --> 36:13.169
Which is still missing, by the way.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.671
No, this is a crime

36:15.047 --> 36:17.883
against one of our own, which will not be tolerated!

36:18.467 --> 36:21.636
So I strongly suggest that the guilty party,

36:21.721 --> 36:25.265
or anyone who knows anything
about this, come forward

36:25.349 --> 36:27.475
or risk immediate expulsion.

was trying to tell you.

36:32.732 --> 36:33.940
What do you mean?

36:34.025 --> 36:36.484
The flash drive's in the music box!

Oh, right, right.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.947
Come on. We're going to the library.
That's where it was stolen.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.490

36:42.575 --> 36:45.201
These shoes! They hurt. They're heels.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.829
And this girdle's riding up all inside me. I can't do it.

36:47.914 --> 36:51.124
All right, but stay in your room
and away from those girls.

36:51.208 --> 36:52.542

I'm looking for this Prodi-G. Have you seen him?

52:22.097 --> 52:25.599
I'm a record producer. I'm very
interested in talking to him.

52:31.815 --> 52:32.982
You're not his partner.

52:33.066 --> 52:34.483

52:59.634 --> 53:00.718
Why do I have to go to art?

53:00.802 --> 53:02.219
Because you're a student here

53:02.304 --> 53:04.138
and you need to keep up your cover.

53:04.222 --> 53:05.431
This ain't even my type of art.

53:05.515 --> 53:06.557
Oh, shut up!

Oh, no, no! Ain't nobody getting naked!

53:32.542 --> 53:33.709
That'd be shameful.

Momma? This is a fine art class.

53:39.215 --> 53:41.216

Yep. That's right, Big Momma. This is fine art.

53:44.721 --> 53:46.722

And besides, we're all women here.

53:50.894 --> 53:53.187
(STAMMERS) Well, of course. I know that.

53:54.189 --> 53:57.733
But what you're doing, you know, with
this woman getting naked...

53:57.817 --> 54:00.569
What you're doing is you're reinforcing

54:00.654 --> 54:02.863
a terrible stereotype.

54:03.573 --> 54:05.658
Yeah, um,

54:05.742 --> 54:09.703
92.6 % of the females in this country

54:09.788 --> 54:11.497
are size 12 or bigger!

54:12.040 --> 54:13.916
Really? Yeah!

54:14.084 --> 54:16.627
What with the media images

54:17.420 --> 54:19.338
telling girls that they won't be happy

54:19.422 --> 54:21.715
unless they're a size negative zero,

54:21.883 --> 54:24.802
well, that just distorts our body image!

54:25.095 --> 54:28.013
And causes eating disorders.

54:28.431 --> 54:30.099
And alopecia.

54:30.308 --> 54:31.558
Oh. Yeah.

54:31.643 --> 54:33.811
And no offense, young lady,

54:34.270 --> 54:37.982
but you got a little body and a big-ass head! Yeah.

54:38.066 --> 54:40.234

54:50.161 --> 54:52.705
I think I agree with Big Momma.

54:52.789 --> 54:54.164
You do? Yes.

We have never once had a full-figured model.

not exactly the kind...

58:08.818 --> 58:10.861
We bought hair dye at Walgreens

58:10.945 --> 58:13.030
and the directions were in Spanish.

My heart, it pounds Yeah, you got me

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:15.897
The party don't start till I walk in

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:19.568
Don't stop, make it pop DJ, blow my speakers up

01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:23.738
Tonight, I'ma fight till we see the sunlight

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:28.118
Tick tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no

01:02:28.202 --> 01:02:31.663
Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:36.126
Tick tock on the clock But the party don't stop, no

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:40.005
Oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.678
You've been Momma-fied.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.847

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:53.435
(GIRLS EXCLAIMING)

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:56.980
What... Is it not me? Is it too much?

01:02:57.064 --> 01:03:00.817
Oh, don't be silly. You just need the final touch.

01:03:00.902 --> 01:03:04.988
Get her a chair. Yeah, okay. Grab a seat. I'll get it.

01:03:09.452 --> 01:03:10.869
Oh!

01:03:10.953 --> 01:03:12.245
There we go.

01:03:12.705 --> 01:03:13.997
Vaseline?

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.874
God's gift to black people.

01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:20.420
Ashy coming out of the bathtub?
Baby's got a diaper rash?

01:03:20.504 --> 01:03:22.589
Your hair look like it just took a mug shot?

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:24.132
Just rub it in!

01:03:24.508 --> 01:03:27.469
There. Watch me work my magic now.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:30.305
Voilà!

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:38.021
There you go. (CHUCKLES)

01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:40.732
You're a genius! Thank you!

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.985
I just brought the beauty outside.

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.529
Um...

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:51.576
Come over here for a second and let
Big Momma get a talk with you.

01:03:52.745 --> 01:03:55.455
Tell me what you know about the missing music box.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:04:00.627
You didn't hear this from me, but Jasmine and Isabelle,

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:04.464
I heard them say they're meeting
someone near the library tonight.

01:04:04.548 --> 01:04:05.548
With what?

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:06.716
I don't know.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.679
But I heard them say that Isabelle's
gonna bring it in her bag.

01:04:22.066 --> 01:04:23.108
You look awesome, girl.

01:04:23.192 --> 01:04:24.276
Oh!

01:04:24.777 --> 01:04:26.778
Back at you, H-bomb.

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:29.739
Yo, Robinson.

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:31.783
Delanté.

01:04:31.867 --> 01:04:33.660
Looking fine today, Haley. Yes, she is.

01:04:33.744 --> 01:04:35.203
How about we hang out after your big show?

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.663
You just broke up with Mia.

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.456
Help me heal.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:41.626
Come on.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.129
IM me if you change your mind.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:47.966
HALEY: Ugh! Those guys are such tools.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.175
TRENT: Right?

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:52.554
So, you got, like, a boyfriend or anything?

01:04:52.638 --> 01:04:54.097
No way.

01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:58.268
I'm beginning to think the guy I'm
looking for doesn't really exist.

01:04:58.352 --> 01:04:59.602
How about you?

01:04:59.687 --> 01:05:01.146
Oh, no, girl.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:03.773
The guy for me definitely does not exist.

01:05:05.192 --> 01:05:08.278
You know what? I think I got somebody
I could hook you up with, girl.

01:05:08.362 --> 01:05:09.738
Really? Yep.

01:05:09.822 --> 01:05:11.364
Who? He's my cousin.

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:14.951
His name is Trent. Hottie. Buff. Right?

01:05:15.453 --> 01:05:18.455
He's our age. Plus, he's like a hip-hop lyrical miracle.

01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:20.248
You've probably seen him perform at the Promenade.

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:21.458
He goes by the name of...

01:05:21.542 --> 01:05:23.251
The Prodi-G? (IN NORMAL VOICE) Yeah, yeah!

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:24.544
(GIRLISHLY) Yeah, yeah!

01:05:24.628 --> 01:05:26.212
Thinks he's all that and then some?

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:27.839
Talks about himself in the third person

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:31.217
and thinks that every girl on the planet is after him?

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:33.303
No offense, Charmaine,

01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:35.930
but your cousin is the last kind
of guy I'd ever hook up with.

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:37.766
(GIGGLES)

01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:38.933
(GIGGLES SARCASTICALLY)

01:05:39.435 --> 01:05:41.019
Ew, the Prodi-G.

01:05:45.816 --> 01:05:47.025
So, uh,

01:05:48.694 --> 01:05:50.195
what is your type?

01:05:50.821 --> 01:05:52.322
He's artistic.

01:05:52.656 --> 01:05:56.117
Sensitive. Interested in people besides himself.

01:05:58.329 --> 01:05:59.996
And he likes long,

01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:03.041
sweet, slow, lingering kisses.

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:06.252
Damn.

01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:08.171
Damn!

01:06:08.672 --> 01:06:10.590
What? Are you making fun of me?

01:06:10.674 --> 01:06:14.260
Oh, no, girl. No, I'm saying that's exactly Trent.

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:17.305
Sure, he can be all puffed up on the outside,

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.473
but once you get to know him,

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:19.891
I'm saying, he's a real sweetheart.

01:06:20.601 --> 01:06:23.436
I mean, you guys should, like, be a couple!

01:06:23.729 --> 01:06:25.397
He was thinking about going
to the Showcase tomorrow.

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:27.774
Maybe you guys can hook up,
you know, after the dance.

01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:29.442
Tomorrow night.

01:06:29.693 --> 01:06:31.111
I don't know. Can I meet him before?

01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:33.905
(CHUCKLING) No! It's tomorrow night.

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:37.075
Well, how about tonight, then?

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.620
Oh, he'll be there.

01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:42.414
Good.

01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:48.920
MALCOLM: Just Kurtis Kool.

01:06:49.004 --> 01:06:50.797
(SIGHS) Let me see.

01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:52.757
What is wrong with you? Your life's in danger

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.426
and what did you do? You go shopping.

01:06:54.718 --> 01:06:57.011
Look, shopping is a very big deal for girls.

01:06:57.304 --> 01:07:00.098
It's like their sports. If they ain't
doing it, they're talking about it.

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:02.517
Comparing stats, tracking sales.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:03.810
It's like a fantasy league, you know?

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:06.688
So help me, Trent, if you're
falling for that Haley girl...

01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:09.315
(STAMMERING) I'm not going for Haley. I mean... No.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.608
She's not my type.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:11.776
Good.

01:07:15.489 --> 01:07:18.491
Okay, so, why don't we just go
down there and intercept it?

01:07:18.742 --> 01:07:21.202
MALCOLM: Not yet. Surveillance is a waiting game.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.371
We can't do anything that could blow our cover.

01:07:23.456 --> 01:07:25.540
Besides, if Mia is spinning us,

01:07:25.624 --> 01:07:27.834
let's just hope that if it is the music box,

01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:29.919
that the flash drive's still inside it.

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:31.629
Oh, okay.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.967
(SIGHS) So we just wait here.

01:07:36.343 --> 01:07:38.636
(HUMMING)

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.018
Wait a minute. Is that the Tempts?

01:07:45.769 --> 01:07:47.562
Not too old school for you?

01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:50.148
No, actually, I was thinking about
sampling it for my mix tape.

01:07:50.357 --> 01:07:51.941
Can you sing it?

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:54.068
I'd rather hum.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:58.156
I mean, but if you sing it, I can catch a
vibe and I can have a dope mix tape

01:07:58.282 --> 01:08:01.409
with some old-school jams on
there. Then we can like...

01:08:01.494 --> 01:08:02.994
All right.

01:08:03.329 --> 01:08:06.164

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:14.589
And I'm so fly But I get it from my fam

01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:16.591
And we in the place and we on a case

01:08:16.675 --> 01:08:19.010
Vibin' out to an old-school jam

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.429
(LAUGHS) I like that.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:24.224
I like how you put the little new
school with the old school.

01:08:24.308 --> 01:08:26.017
I could feel that.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.604
I could jam to that. I could, you
know, do this little thing I do.

01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:31.189
Now, what's that?

01:08:31.314 --> 01:08:33.358
A little something I used to do back in the day

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:34.442
called the Cleveland Shuffle.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:36.277
Oh, no, I need that. Come on.

01:08:36.362 --> 01:08:37.487
Well, it's two to the right.

01:08:37.571 --> 01:08:38.613
Okay.

01:08:38.697 --> 01:08:41.241
Two to the left. Now freak with it.

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:44.702
Freak with it. Freak with it, freak with it.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:48.038
Kick. Now you get your spin on. Right?

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:49.957
Right? Bring it back.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:52.085
(EXCLAIMS) Then you freak with it.

01:08:52.336 --> 01:08:54.045
Freak with it. That's right.

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:56.798
And your arms got to be in a little T. Rex position.

01:08:56.881 --> 01:08:58.633
Okay. So a little something...

01:08:58.716 --> 01:08:59.801
Now freak with it.

01:08:59.885 --> 01:09:01.301
So it's like the Soulja Boy, right?

01:09:01.428 --> 01:09:04.680
No, Soulja Boy, that's a little hop thing.

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:06.683
I know what you're talking about,
but that's a little hop thing.

01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:08.434
This is... This is more like this?

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:10.687
This is Tempts. When them boys was...

01:09:10.770 --> 01:09:12.479
I like that. You know, "Oooh!"

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.064
You know, that kind of thing.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.484
That's why I like doing this move.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:18.903
'Cause it's not that complicated.

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:20.613

01:09:24.368 --> 01:09:25.535
Wait, what's up?

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:28.287
There are the girls. All right.

01:09:28.913 --> 01:09:31.040
Chirkoff must have gotten to Kurtis Kool

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:33.251
and Kurtis Kool got the girls to steal the music box.

01:09:33.544 --> 01:09:34.627
I can't believe that.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:37.671
Look, Trent. Get back in that dress, all right?

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:38.840
I'm gonna check it out.

01:09:38.924 --> 01:09:39.966
Okay.

(UPBEAT SOUL MUSIC PLAYING)

Come on You're outta sight

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:11.164
You got to give me just what I need

01:10:11.749 --> 01:10:15.627
And a sweet little something that
brings a man to his knees

01:10:16.295 --> 01:10:19.464
I like it easy I like it nice and slow

Wow, a security guard with stalkers.

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:28.473
I'm a curious woman.

01:10:28.807 --> 01:10:31.643
Why don't you come and throw
back some juice with me?

01:10:31.727 --> 01:10:33.811
Let me satisfy that curiosity.

01:10:37.691 --> 01:10:40.026
Well, all right. A little juice.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.278
This way? Mmm-hmm.

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:56.334
(MAN SINGING) I know, lately

01:10:56.502 --> 01:10:58.002
Hey, have you seen a girl...

01:10:58.087 --> 01:10:59.962
Oh, okay. Thank you.

Trent?

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:16.688
What's up? How you doing?

01:11:17.856 --> 01:11:23.236
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late. These poetry
readings always run long.

01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:26.739
You do spoken word?

01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:28.074
Yeah.

01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:32.954
And I like slow, lingering kisses.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.124
You know, it's weird that you would say that.

01:11:36.333 --> 01:11:38.918
Yeah, 'cause you feel the same way, too, right?

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:41.838
No, it's just weird that you would say that.

01:11:45.509 --> 01:11:50.138
Right, right. Because rap don't allow
me to get my sensitivities out.

01:11:51.223 --> 01:11:53.391
And I got a lot of sensitivities

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:56.644
I like to get out. As a man, it's like...

01:11:57.062 --> 01:11:59.355
They're deep. It's like an ocean inside me.

01:12:00.065 --> 01:12:02.316
At the poetry jam, uh,

01:12:02.401 --> 01:12:04.485
we get all our sensitivities out,
you know what I'm saying?

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.320
And we be snapping...

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:07.613
(SIGHING) Okay.

01:12:07.698 --> 01:12:10.408
And it's like... It's, uh...

01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:13.161
You know, I'm really sorry all Charmaine's
coaching had to go to waste,

01:12:13.245 --> 01:12:14.495
but I think that I'm just going to go.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.664
No, no, no, wait, just stay. Stay.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.416
(STAMMERS) Look.

01:12:18.542 --> 01:12:22.170
Charmaine told me you were a beautiful, great girl.

01:12:22.254 --> 01:12:25.840
And usually, beautiful, great girls don't go for...

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.091
The Prodi-G?

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:30.595
Yeah. Well, that's not exactly who I am.

01:12:31.930 --> 01:12:34.432
This isn't who I am. This is...

01:12:38.562 --> 01:12:40.980
Okay, then, who are you?

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:46.194
I don't know. I don't know who I am.

01:12:46.278 --> 01:12:48.654
I'm still trying to figure that out.

01:12:50.949 --> 01:12:51.991
Me, too.

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:54.452
Yeah. Can we run this back?

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.454
Yes. Yes, we can.

01:12:56.663 --> 01:12:58.039
I'm Trent.

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.333
Haley. Haley.

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:06.798
Your champagne, my Nubian goddess.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:11.093
Now don't go putting me on no pedestal.
You know it might break.

01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:14.722
What you talking about, girl?
I like a woman with a little

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.641
funk in her trunk!

01:13:17.601 --> 01:13:21.145
And some shrimp in the backyard. That's a woman!

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:24.023
(LAUGHS) Well, you know I like me
a man with a dangerous side.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:27.902
Something tells me that Kurtis Kool is not just a man

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:29.612
with keys and a Taser, huh?

01:13:29.696 --> 01:13:30.738
(LAUGHING)

01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:32.657
And you're ticklish!

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:39.163
Well, I'm into some illegalities at the moment.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:40.915
Oh? Well, what kind?

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:44.001
Well, just typical BS, you know.

01:13:45.128 --> 01:13:46.754
Middleman stuff.

01:13:47.631 --> 01:13:49.799
Holding something hot.

01:13:51.134 --> 01:13:52.635
(WHISPERING) That's "stolen."

01:13:54.221 --> 01:13:55.596
Who you holding it for?

01:13:57.057 --> 01:13:58.140
What are you, the FBI?

01:13:59.017 --> 01:14:01.185
No! Ain't no FBI!

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.104
You wearing a wire?

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:04.438
What? No!

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:05.690
I'm going to find the wire!

01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:07.775
Can you hear this? No...

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:12.071
Now that's funny, 'cause I know I ain't no FBI.

01:14:12.197 --> 01:14:13.614
This I know.

01:14:14.032 --> 01:14:15.533
(CHUCKLING)

01:14:16.243 --> 01:14:17.869
(SIGHING) Oh.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.872
You're so beautiful.

01:14:21.874 --> 01:14:23.583
So much I like you.

01:14:24.001 --> 01:14:25.251
You know,

01:14:26.503 --> 01:14:29.755
you're my high priestess of delight.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.258
No, no... Kurtis Kool!

01:14:32.342 --> 01:14:34.218
I just want to bite you! Kurtis!

01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:37.805
You got

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.683
Motownopoly. Let's play.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.727
Yeah.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:44.812
I got a better game than that.

01:14:48.609 --> 01:14:50.318
(HALEY LAUGHING)

01:14:52.779 --> 01:14:55.448
TRENT: So, look, I should get back.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.117
Really? Why?

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:01.412
I guess I got a little time.

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:03.623
Damn! Damn!

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.876
Yo! It's Trent!

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.420
Yo, you got the producer guy's number?

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:11.339
Yo, call him and tell him we found our boy.

01:15:11.423 --> 01:15:12.882
What's he doing?

01:15:15.802 --> 01:15:18.137
Yeah. Yeah, we found our boy!

01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:19.805
(ENGINE STARTING)

01:15:27.272 --> 01:15:29.607
Trent! Yo!

01:15:30.817 --> 01:15:34.278
Whoa! Rembrandt. Wow.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:37.031
Yeah. This is my crew.

01:15:37.115 --> 01:15:38.532
This is Rembrandt and Scratch.

01:15:38.617 --> 01:15:39.659
Hey.

01:15:39.743 --> 01:15:41.160
How you doing? How you doing?

01:15:41.244 --> 01:15:43.287
Yo, you got your step-pop to sign the contract yet?

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.872
Yeah, man, I'm on it.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.290
Come on, I want to take you somewhere.

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.042
Okay.

01:15:48.418 --> 01:15:50.086
See you guys later. See you guys.

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:51.170
All right.

01:15:51.254 --> 01:15:52.380
Yeah, you do that!

01:15:52.464 --> 01:15:54.298
'Cause we got somebody we want you to meet.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:56.133
Yeah, I'll holler. Okay.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.718
Yeah, yeah! Tomorrow, Trent!

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:01.555
Scratch and Rembrandt, they're like,
I don't know, one's tall, one's short.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.516
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I noticed that.

01:16:05.268 --> 01:16:06.519
We found him.

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:09.981
CHIRKOFF: Just stay with him. See
if he leads you to the father.

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:11.232
Okay.

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:19.490
Let the games begin.

01:16:21.159 --> 01:16:23.995
You know, these girls of mine are driving me up a wall.

01:16:24.287 --> 01:16:26.580
You know Jasmine Lee and Isabelle Parada?

01:16:26.999 --> 01:16:29.000
No, refresh my memory.

01:16:29.459 --> 01:16:30.835
Left foot, red.

01:16:34.589 --> 01:16:36.966
They gave you a bag about an hour ago.

01:16:38.176 --> 01:16:40.302
Right foot, yellow.

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:47.101
Oh! That Jasmine and Isabelle.

01:16:47.519 --> 01:16:49.979
(GRUNTS) Sorry, Big Momma.

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:54.316
You know, those girls could be in a
lot of trouble. And so could you.

01:16:55.235 --> 01:16:56.902
So who you holding that bag for?

01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:59.113
Someone outside the school?

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:01.365
You really want to see that bag?

01:17:02.617 --> 01:17:03.743
Damn!

01:17:05.495 --> 01:17:07.121
Right hand, blue.

01:17:07.539 --> 01:17:09.081
Are you...

01:17:09.916 --> 01:17:11.292
Is it blue?

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.419
Mmm-hmm. Right hand, blue.

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:21.135
Come to papa.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:39.070
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:17:39.404 --> 01:17:41.072
KURTIS: Left hand, green!

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:43.699
Oh, well...

01:17:43.784 --> 01:17:46.827
Looks like we're all out of green. Game over.

01:17:46.912 --> 01:17:50.039
No, no, no. I got your green.

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:53.709
(GRUNTS)

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.670
Okay. Go ahead. Reach for the stars, baby.

01:17:56.755 --> 01:17:58.130
(IN NORMAL VOICE) Oh, hell, no!

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.466
What's wrong with your voice?

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:03.260
You heard me. Get your ass up.

01:18:06.473 --> 01:18:07.598
Sister, you a brother?

01:18:10.769 --> 01:18:11.811
Not again.

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.814
You touch me again, I'll knock you into next Sunday.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:18.025
Hand over the bag. Hand over the bag, now!

01:18:20.403 --> 01:18:23.531
Every time I try to meet somebody,
it's ding-a-ling-a-ling!

01:18:23.615 --> 01:18:25.116
Be quiet! All right?

01:18:25.325 --> 01:18:28.702
I'm undercover. FBI. Now give me the damn bag.

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.830
Wow. (EXCLAIMS IMPATIENTLY)

01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:40.673
What the hell?

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:52.309
What the hell is a grown man
doing with a damn rooster?

01:18:52.727 --> 01:18:55.146
(SIGHS) The girls stole it from St. Ignatius.

01:18:55.772 --> 01:18:57.731
The boys' school? They're the Gamecocks.

01:18:58.191 --> 01:19:00.151
They were gonna give it back after the Showcase.

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:03.237
(CLUCKING)

01:19:04.948 --> 01:19:06.448
You want to finish the game?

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:10.744
Come on.

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:11.996
Where are we going?

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.664
You'll see. Okay.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:24.216
Wow.

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:26.760
It's my home away from home.

01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:28.470
This is nice.

01:19:28.555 --> 01:19:29.597
Tomorrow night's the Showcase

01:19:29.681 --> 01:19:32.183
and it's my best shot at getting
a scholarship for composition.

01:19:32.517 --> 01:19:34.685
Without a scholarship, I'm out.

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.563
Everyone is gonna be there, you know?

01:19:37.647 --> 01:19:40.024
Juilliard, Berklee, Peabody and Oberlin.

01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:43.235
All right, look. Okay. So, I see
a beautiful woman right now.

01:19:43.403 --> 01:19:45.112
I see a dope piano.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:47.615
And nobody's playing it.

01:19:48.825 --> 01:19:50.201
You want me to play?

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:52.369
Yeah.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:53.454
Right now.

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:55.539
All right, I guess I gotta play it.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:57.875
No, no, don't touch my piano.

01:19:59.336 --> 01:20:01.086
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:03.380
(CLEARING THROAT)

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:08.093
Okay, please don't judge. It's rough.

01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:12.223
(PLAYING SOULFUL TUNE)

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:14.475
(SINGING WORDLESS MELODY)

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.359
See? It's not totally there yet.

01:20:23.443 --> 01:20:24.735
I don't know, something's missing.

01:20:24.819 --> 01:20:27.112
No, it's not missing nothing. It's tight.

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:29.573
You just got to feel it, you know what I mean?

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:32.451
You got to, like, speed it up a little bit.

01:20:32.535 --> 01:20:33.994
Speed it up? Yeah.

01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:36.121
Okay, um...

01:20:36.539 --> 01:20:38.540
(PLAYING SLIGHTLY FASTER)

01:20:39.876 --> 01:20:41.085
Yeah. Yeah.

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:42.920
That's better, right? Yeah.

01:20:45.757 --> 01:20:47.591
(SINGING WORDLESS MELODY)

01:20:54.724 --> 01:20:57.726
(SINGING) You've given me everything

You make me complete

Yeah, I like that, I like that.

01:21:13.159 --> 01:21:14.201
You like that?

01:21:14.286 --> 01:21:15.995
Should we syncopate it?

01:21:16.079 --> 01:21:19.957
(SIGHS) Look, normally, I don't syncopate
on the first date, but...

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:21.834
(SINGING WORDLESS MELODY)

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:26.338
(HARMONIZING)

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:35.889
All right, this is what we're gonna do next, right?

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:38.100
You're gonna go up a little higher.
You know what I mean?

01:21:38.184 --> 01:21:39.935
Up an octave?

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:41.687
Yeah, an octave.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:46.108
(PLAYING HIGHER)

01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:58.203
(SINGING) Baby, you know

01:21:59.205 --> 01:22:02.082
You are the air that I breathe

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.210

Yeah, you are all I need

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:53.884
You're making me better, see

All of the love that you're giving me

How did you... That song is amazing.

01:23:07.357 --> 01:23:08.399
It's perfect, right?

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:11.068
We have to do it at the Showcase tomorrow night.

01:23:11.152 --> 01:23:12.319
We?

this. I can't do it without you.

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:29.253
Thank you!

I love that.

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:51.108
You're so amazing with words.

01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:53.277
I can't believe you don't want to go to college.

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:56.738
I mean, all of those writers and poets you could study.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:59.950
You know, I just figured I got
to strike while the iron's hot.

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:03.120
Jay-Z didn't drop Reasonable Doubt until he was 27.

01:24:04.789 --> 01:24:07.875
Said the world's in a rush, but he waited to be perfect.

01:24:09.836 --> 01:24:10.961
Hmm.

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:12.463
Well,

01:24:13.381 --> 01:24:15.466
I'm feeling pretty perfect right now.

01:24:59.177 --> 01:25:02.012
Then take him. We'll kill him later.

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:32.000
You got to give the kid credit.

01:25:37.632 --> 01:25:39.132
Not so much.

You idiots! How could you lose him?

01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:02.322

Okay, I'm going to give you to the count of three.

There go one of my flock in need of some counseling.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:23.904
Listen. I suggest you get this bird back to St. Ignatius

01:27:23.988 --> 01:27:25.822

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:27.824
