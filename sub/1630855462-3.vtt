WEBVTT

00:03.770 --> 00:07.007
Our neighbor Sean
has begun a bid

00:07.040 --> 00:11.144
to ruthlessly unseat
Staten Island's rulers

00:11.178 --> 00:13.280
so that the crown
of absolute power

00:13.313 --> 00:16.717
may rest solely upon his head.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.586
Com... Comptroller.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.754
What the fuck is that?

00:20.787 --> 00:22.723
The comptroller
controls the budget

00:22.756 --> 00:24.458
for all of Staten Island.

00:24.491 --> 00:27.060
I'm really proud
of my campaign platform:

00:27.094 --> 00:30.664
Bring the Rangers
back to Staten Island.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.666
So, I think I'm gonna win.

00:32.699 --> 00:35.335
-Ah.
-Ah. Seanie.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.105
Typically, in a situation
such as this,

00:38.138 --> 00:41.375
the best move is to identify
your opponents

00:41.408 --> 00:43.510
and then slaughter them
in their sleep.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.279
Yeah, yeah, I wish, but, uh,

00:45.312 --> 00:48.048
no, we just got to get
the most votes.

00:48.081 --> 00:49.683
-[growls]
-But our latest round
of internal polling

00:49.716 --> 00:52.386
has revealed that we have,
uh, a couple of weak spots.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.454
Particularly,
the gay demographic.

00:54.488 --> 00:58.025
So we got to do something that's
gonna knock their socks off.

00:58.058 --> 01:02.229
Which is why we are doing
a Pride parade!

01:02.262 --> 01:04.364
-Right here in Staten Island.
-Yeah.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.166
Looks great.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.035
So, you two are organizing
a Pride parade?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.136
Yeah!

01:09.169 --> 01:10.537
[Guillermo]
I'm a little skeptical.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.306
I've never actually
been to Pride.

01:12.339 --> 01:15.475
But something tells me...
neither have Sean and Charmaine.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.246
My lesbian roommate
from SUNY New Paltz,

01:19.279 --> 01:20.747
-Oh, yeah.
-she's gonna come and do
some rhythmic gymnastics.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.483
[Sean] Oh, yeah,
and my bisexual cousin Dominic?

01:23.517 --> 01:24.518
You remember him.

01:24.551 --> 01:26.553
Oh, I certainly do.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.722
He is gonna lip-synch to some
hot tunes all night long.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.392
-Ooh, yeah.
-Respectfully, uh,
Neighbor Sean...

01:32.426 --> 01:33.560
-Yes.
-What has this
got to do with us?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.195
We are very busy.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.264
A little bird recently
flew into my bedroom

01:37.297 --> 01:39.333
and I've been trying
to make him my friend.

01:39.366 --> 01:43.637
Yeah, well, uh, we just wanted
to consult with you guys

01:43.670 --> 01:48.075
considering you're members of
the LGBTQ... LMNOP community.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.711
And we consider you guys
heroes for that.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.646
Literally the gayest things
on the block.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.748
I like what you've been saying.
It's been very entertaining.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.584
But just for two seconds,
shut the fuck up.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.052
I know why you're here.

01:59.086 --> 02:02.055
You want us to grand marshal
your gay parade?

02:02.089 --> 02:03.457
That's a thumbs up.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.526
You want to start your
gay parade on our front lawn?

02:05.559 --> 02:07.394
That's two thumbs up.

02:07.427 --> 02:08.762
What are those vehicles called

02:08.795 --> 02:10.564
that are all brightly colored?

02:10.597 --> 02:12.032
-Very jolly.
-Oh...

02:12.065 --> 02:13.267
You mean chariots,

02:13.300 --> 02:16.003
dragging the corpses
of your vanquished foes.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.437
-We call them "floats."
-Yeah.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.040
-The corpses float also.
-[Charmaine] Yes, yes, yes.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.441
The fire department, the wives,
they've all signed up

02:21.475 --> 02:23.010
to make a big float for us.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.711
Really? Tell those
wives to get fucked.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.313
-Oh.
-I'm gonna make the float.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.182
It'll be the most fantastic
thing you've ever seen.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.750
-[Laszlo cackles]
-[Sean] Okay...

02:29.783 --> 02:31.351
That's way more
than we expected.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.020
We just came here to see

02:33.053 --> 02:34.421
which one of these T-shirts
you liked better.

02:34.454 --> 02:36.023
Yeah, we got two choices:

02:36.056 --> 02:37.691
"Yas Sean!"

02:37.724 --> 02:41.228
And "Ay,
I'm Bein' Gay Ova Here!"

02:41.261 --> 02:43.063
[Laszlo]
We'll buy the lot.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.403
Besides your legs
being crushed, I mean.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.139
Of course I'm still pissed off
at Nadja for crushing me

03:26.173 --> 03:27.641
with her vampire ass.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.109
I mean, look at this bullshit.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.211
I'm three-quarters
mechanical automaton.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.713
Ah, shit.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.382
Well, I suppose the loss
of my dolly body

03:35.415 --> 03:38.151
has got me thinking
about my old human body.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.521
I never got to use it, fully.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.123
-Huh?
-I never got to experience...

03:43.156 --> 03:44.725
carnal pleasure?

03:44.758 --> 03:46.360
-What?
-Oh.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.128
I think what she means is...

03:48.162 --> 03:50.097
-She's a virgin.
-[Nadja Doll] Nailed it.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.298
How can you be a virgin?

03:51.331 --> 03:53.667
Your spirit is identical
to my own and I am...

03:53.700 --> 03:56.136
definitely not a virgin.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.539
I am a manifestation
of your ghost, right?

03:58.572 --> 04:01.441
Which is who you were when
you died and became a vampire.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.677
And at that point,
you were a virgin.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.213
What about Jonas
the mule dancer?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.514
Strictly hand stuff.

04:07.548 --> 04:11.752
I remain a virgin
and I fear I always will be.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.621
If there was anything, anything
I could about this, I would,

04:14.655 --> 04:17.391
but sadly I just... I don't...

04:17.424 --> 04:20.260
Well, what if we swapped bodies?

04:20.294 --> 04:21.461
Just for a day.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.030
What a cute little idea,

04:23.063 --> 04:25.465
but unfortunately that
is definitely not possible.

04:25.499 --> 04:27.601
Oh, no, it's possible.

04:27.634 --> 04:30.404
The swapping of spirits
and their corporeal vessels.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.206
Actually, pretty easy.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.341
-Is it?
-Oh, yeah.

04:34.374 --> 04:35.642
-Well.
-[Nadja Doll] Great!

04:35.676 --> 04:37.077
-Great.
-Great.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.479
Okay! Oh... great.

04:39.513 --> 04:41.181
-That is just...
-Great.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.517
Well, great.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.288
[Nandor]
I have discovered why Guillermo

04:48.322 --> 04:50.023
has been avoiding me lately.

04:50.057 --> 04:53.360
He has fallen under
the sway of Laszlo.

04:53.393 --> 04:57.297
Laszlo is jealous because of how
much Guillermo worships me.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.298
Oh. There you are.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.700
Not now, Nandor.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.568
Can't you see I'm teaching
the boy science?

05:01.602 --> 05:04.404
-Thank you.
-But I... [stammers]

05:04.438 --> 05:06.373
[Nandor]
He has decided
to try and impress him

05:06.406 --> 05:09.142
with his only
impressive quality.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.078
-[zapping]
-Ooh!

05:11.111 --> 05:13.247
[Nandor] His quote,
unquote "intelligence."

05:14.748 --> 05:16.350
End quote.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.652
-Maybe I just--
-[Laszlo] No, Nandor.

05:18.685 --> 05:22.089
[Nandor]
I personally value qualities
that cannot be taught.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.224
Courage. Relentlessness.

05:24.258 --> 05:27.261
Being tall.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.730
Do you think he actually bought
that whole science lesson thing?

05:29.763 --> 05:32.399
Obviously.

05:32.432 --> 05:33.767
For if he knew the truth,

05:33.800 --> 05:35.402
that you've been
turned into a vampire

05:35.435 --> 05:37.070
by somebody other than him,

05:37.104 --> 05:38.739
you'd be fucking dead by now.

05:38.772 --> 05:39.740
How can I put this?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.642
The boy is...

05:41.675 --> 05:43.277
fucked up.

05:43.310 --> 05:46.046
Yeah, I really can't see
what's going on back there.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.748
I think it might be like a
psoriasis flareup or something.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.583
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.552
Can you move them?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.220
Move what?

05:53.253 --> 05:54.421
Nothing.

05:54.454 --> 05:57.357
All good and proper.

05:57.391 --> 05:58.992
Now, what I intend to do

05:59.026 --> 06:01.328
is carry out a few basic
experiments on the boy.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.596
Firstly, agility.

06:02.629 --> 06:06.133
Vampire super speed test
number 72, begin.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.435
[grunts]

06:08.468 --> 06:10.237
[Laszlo]
Vampiric turnoffs.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.372
[muffled] I'm holding
the garlic to your face.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.674
Is it having any effect?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.309
Telekinesis.

06:15.342 --> 06:18.378
Concentrate on that
antique flask and make it rise.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.514
Patient running at normal
human speed,

06:20.547 --> 06:21.782
slightly below
normal human speed.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.116
Lick it!

06:23.150 --> 06:24.785
-I'd rather not.
-If you don't lick it,

06:24.818 --> 06:26.653
I cannot diagnose you.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.655
Oh, that's not bad.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.492
[Laszlo]
And from that, we'll have
a better idea as to

06:31.525 --> 06:33.126
what kind of vampire he is,

06:33.160 --> 06:34.228
or isn't.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.496
I didn't ask you
to squeeze one out.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.530
If I knew you were
gonna do that,

06:36.563 --> 06:37.297
I'd have put
some newspaper down.

06:37.331 --> 06:39.099
I'm doing it.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.634
-Doing what? Squeezing one out?
-No.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.303
What the blazes?

06:43.337 --> 06:44.771
He's clearly been
afflicted by vampirism.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.306
All right, you can stop there.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.674
But his turning
has been stymied.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.676
Being a man of science,

06:49.710 --> 06:52.179
I intend to find out why.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.081
For this requires
a systematic review

06:54.114 --> 06:55.582
of everything we know
about vampirism.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.018
We must go back.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.187
Back to the beginning.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.522
Now clean that shit up.

07:01.555 --> 07:04.124
All right, so tonight is Friday.

07:04.158 --> 07:08.061
Otherwise known in spiritual
circles as Freaky Friday.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.532
And thus we are technically
able to swap your souls.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.200
And that's really how it works?

07:13.233 --> 07:14.635
-Yes.
-Okay, whatever.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.703
Fine. Can I just
get something clear?

07:16.737 --> 07:18.472
My dolly is going
to inhabit my body

07:18.505 --> 07:21.241
to use it to get completely
and utterly railed.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.177
-[Nadja Doll] Yes, please.
-And then we will switch back?

07:23.210 --> 07:24.011
-Correct.
-Correct.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.712
[sighs]

07:25.746 --> 07:27.014
Okay, so put your hands
on the orb

07:27.047 --> 07:28.482
and close your eyes.

07:28.515 --> 07:32.352
Daimes times nokti onidete.

07:32.386 --> 07:35.355

07:40.160 --> 07:42.162
[gasping]

07:42.196 --> 07:44.364
[laughing] It worked!

07:44.398 --> 07:46.200
It's fucking amazing.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.168
I'm big, bitches!

07:48.202 --> 07:50.637
Uh, be careful. Maybe work
your way up a little bit?

07:50.671 --> 07:52.206
[laughing]

07:52.239 --> 07:53.507
Ugh, I can't feel my feet.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.641
That's because you
don't have any.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.110
-Sucks, doesn't it?
-Easy.

07:57.144 --> 08:00.514
I forgot how amazing
it is to have a real body!

08:00.547 --> 08:02.182
-Stretch first!
-Wow!

08:02.216 --> 08:03.750
-Oh! Oh!
-Oh, watch out!

08:03.784 --> 08:06.386
So, who wants to have
a little bite

08:06.420 --> 08:09.690
of this fresh beef salad?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.391
Trust me, Dolly, you don't
want your first time

08:11.425 --> 08:13.393
to be with anyone in this house.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.529
These people are ran-through.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.131
We are going to find you
a fresh piece of ass.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.033
Wait for me, koukla mou.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.335
I'm doing it.

08:21.369 --> 08:23.064
I'm a real body person.

08:23.326 --> 08:24.380
-[cameraman] Careful!
-Oh. Oh.

08:28.546 --> 08:33.714
That's right. We swapped bodies.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.550
Huh. Looks like
they're turning the GNC

08:36.583 --> 08:38.352
into a Jersey Mike's.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.587
None of you find
this interesting? Hello?

08:40.621 --> 08:42.322
[Nandor]
Not really.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.123
I mean, you're kind of
the same person anyway.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.196
[Colin]
We weren't.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.697
...what do we actually
know about them?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.065
Why?

08:52.099 --> 08:55.035
Uh, for...

08:55.068 --> 08:57.171
the purposes of the float?

08:57.204 --> 09:00.040
Oh, I see. Boy stuff.
Vroom, vroom. Carry on.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.677
Vamp
ires. The first thing that
comes into your head. Anybody.

09:03.710 --> 09:07.181
Oh, uh, they tend to form
insular social units

09:07.214 --> 09:10.150
and not let perceived
outsiders join the group.

09:10.184 --> 09:13.187
Like I said, what do we know
about vampires?

09:13.220 --> 09:16.456
Vampires always go soft
after two pumps.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.258
It's a classic vampire thing.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.294
-Uh...
-What about the one
where if you

09:20.327 --> 09:23.163
drop a bunch of rice
in front of a vampire

09:23.197 --> 09:25.299
he has to count
every single grain?

09:25.332 --> 09:27.701
No, I, too, have heard that
before. But I think it's cack.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.404
-Hmm, but there again,
it might not be.
-[Nadja] Isn't there a thing

09:30.437 --> 09:33.340
that if you throw a vampire's
shoe into the river,

09:33.373 --> 09:34.208
you have to follow it?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.542
Oh, yes, true.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.178
Don't be silly, it's not a shoe.

09:38.212 --> 09:39.580
It is a sock.

09:39.613 --> 09:43.350
Come on, this is classic
Vampire 101 shit, guys.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.418
Well, the only way
I'm gonna find this out

09:44.451 --> 09:45.485
is if I put it to the test.

09:45.519 --> 09:46.753
Come on, Gizmo.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.056
Oh, and me.
I'd like to come, too.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.724
I don't think so.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.293
No, you-you should
probably stay with Sean

09:53.327 --> 09:55.429
and help him with the float,
for the parade.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.564
Or talk to your bird
in-in your room.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.266
I'm not speaking to Matthew
at the moment.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.568
All right, fine.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.037

10:05.472 --> 10:06.673

10:09.610 --> 10:12.045
[Nadja] So, I thought there's
no better place for my Dolly

10:12.079 --> 10:15.282
to find some piping-hot strange
than speed dating.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.417
Hello, everyone. I'm a virgin.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.152
I already regret this.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.455
I used to be dead,
and then I was a ghost,

10:21.488 --> 10:24.024
and then I was a doll,
and now...

10:24.057 --> 10:26.293
I am human once more. [laughs]

10:26.326 --> 10:27.661

10:29.463 --> 10:31.298
-I'm in sales.
-Ooh.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.067
-I like him.

10:34.101 --> 10:37.070
My dowry is really cheap.

10:37.104 --> 10:41.441

you can even slit its throat,

10:41.475 --> 10:44.444
-boom, I'm your wife.
-Oof.
-[bell rings]

10:44.478 --> 10:47.281
How do you feel about taking
the virginity of a dead ghost?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.415
It's your lucky night.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.583
-Ugh.
-[bell rings]

10:49.616 --> 10:51.318

10:53.086 --> 10:55.022
Ela! This is a mating dance

10:55.055 --> 10:58.325
because I have selected you
to be my mate.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.726
Look how wide I am.

Fuck off, lady!

Okay. All right.
You are out of here. Come on.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.034
What? No, I was just
doing a date.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.569
-Yes, thank you, remove us.
-Come on.
-Oh.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.437
[Laszlo]
Commence the test.

11:13.440 --> 11:16.043
Absolutely no urge
to count the rice.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.011
I don't know what Colin Robinson
was talking about.

11:18.045 --> 11:21.048
Another vampire myth
proved to be nonsense.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.584
But just before I attend
to other duties...

11:23.617 --> 11:25.052
-Yes.
-One.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.220
-Two. Four.
-Three.

11:26.253 --> 11:27.421
-Five.
-Six.

11:27.454 --> 11:28.288
Maybe we should move
on to the next test?

11:28.322 --> 11:29.456
Shut up. Seven.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.258
-Eight. Ten.
-Nine. Eleven.

11:31.291 --> 11:35.028
All right, next up is vampires
can triple jump?

11:35.062 --> 11:36.196
Ah.

11:36.230 --> 11:37.431
What does that even mean?

11:37.464 --> 11:38.966
I'll show you what it means.

11:42.202 --> 11:43.704

11:47.207 --> 11:48.342
Oh.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.277
Yo, Laz. What you
doing up there?

11:50.310 --> 11:51.445
Oh, hi, Sean.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.014
Um, just checking out
your float.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.015
Looks fantastic.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.683
-[Sean] Good night.
-See ya.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.186
[Guillermo]
So, two small jumps,
and on the third jump,

11:59.219 --> 12:01.221
jump real high, like Mario.

12:01.255 --> 12:03.290
Mario who?

12:03.323 --> 12:05.125
Why bother with fancy jumps
when you can just fly?

12:05.159 --> 12:07.294
-Flying does have its limits.
-Oh, really?

12:07.327 --> 12:08.729
A vampire can only ascend
as high

12:08.762 --> 12:10.564
as the lowest cloud in the area.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.066
Well, I think that is more
of a Laszlo thing

12:13.100 --> 12:14.168
than a vampire thing.

12:14.201 --> 12:15.402
Really?

12:15.435 --> 12:17.137
Well, how high can you fly?

12:17.171 --> 12:19.206
Outer space.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.141
Write that down.

12:21.175 --> 12:23.043
Maybe not write that down,
on the account of it being...

12:23.076 --> 12:24.711
bullshit.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.747
I get it, you have never
flown to outer space.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.749
No.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.284
For some, it is
a little too scary.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.451
But not for me.

12:31.485 --> 12:34.054
That's why I've done it
many times.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.055
I mean, you know,

12:35.088 --> 12:38.025
I've flown up like really high.

12:38.058 --> 12:41.028
Now, have I technically flown
to outer space?

12:41.061 --> 12:42.396
No.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.299
But there's no reason
why I couldn't.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.201
I mean, I don't have to breathe
oxygen or any shit like that.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.436
So, yeah.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.573
I did not lie.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.676
I am essentially the king
of outer space.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.277
Of course you are, Major Tom.

12:57.311 --> 12:58.745
Enough of that nonsense.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.048
Find me a river
I can toss my sock into.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.149
You know what?!

13:02.182 --> 13:06.186
I think I might just fly
to outer space right now!

13:06.220 --> 13:08.689
Not you or you can stop me.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.457
Or you!

13:10.491 --> 13:13.560
So, good luck with your shitty
little science experiments,

13:13.594 --> 13:16.430
because I'm going
to outer space!

13:16.463 --> 13:19.032
Well, speed dating was a bust.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.268
But there is one person in
the house the doll is horny for.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.003
I don't like this decision,

13:23.036 --> 13:24.571
but since we all F each other
all the time here anyway,

13:24.605 --> 13:26.607
I can't be a hypocrite.

-Nope.

13:28.609 --> 13:30.711

in Real Nadja's body

13:34.448 --> 13:36.416
wants to have sex with me?

13:36.450 --> 13:37.618

-Yep.

fine with this?

Mm-hmm.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.594
And-and you're not gonna
kill me after...?

13:47.628 --> 13:48.695

13:48.729 --> 13:50.030
I'm open to it, I-I just...

13:50.063 --> 13:51.598

our friendship.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.334
Oh, no, we don't really
like you that much.

13:54.368 --> 13:55.702

13:55.736 --> 13:57.271
No.

want to doink me?
