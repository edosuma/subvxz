01:08.868 --> 01:10.902
Master Splinter,
you have taught me much

01:10.904 --> 01:12.838
about the ways
of the ninja,

01:12.840 --> 01:14.906
but I know that there
is one combat maneuver

01:14.908 --> 01:16.407
you have yet
to teach any of us.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.577
Very well, Leonardo.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.279
I will teach you
the one technique

01:21.281 --> 01:23.281
for which
there is no defense:

01:23.283 --> 01:25.617
the viper maneuver.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.886
The, uh, viper maneuver?

01:27.888 --> 01:29.620
To accomplish this move,

01:29.622 --> 01:32.857
you must first let your
whole spine become flexible,

01:32.859 --> 01:34.226
like a snake's.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.461
This draws your
opponent toward you.

01:36.463 --> 01:40.398
Then you must transform
your spine into solid steel,

01:40.400 --> 01:42.667
striking like a cobra.

01:47.172 --> 01:48.840
Now you try it.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.408
Spine like serpent,

01:50.410 --> 01:52.143
then like steel,

01:52.145 --> 01:54.412
strike!

01:54.414 --> 01:57.982
Ah, I guess I need
a little practice.

01:57.984 --> 02:00.185
Spine like serpent,

02:00.187 --> 02:01.619
then like steel,

02:01.621 --> 02:03.688
strike!

02:05.424 --> 02:08.059
I do not understand,
Leonardo.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.961
You're
my most gifted pupil,

02:09.963 --> 02:12.497
yet this maneuver seems
beyond your ability.

02:12.499 --> 02:15.433
Ah, maybe I'm just
having a bad day.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.435
Perhaps you have
some hidden fear

02:17.437 --> 02:19.838
which prevents you from
accomplishing the maneuver.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.205
What?

02:21.207 --> 02:22.607
That's not true,
Master Splinter.

02:22.609 --> 02:24.242
I'm not afraid
of anything.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.144
If you say so, my pupil,

02:26.146 --> 02:29.080
but you will not be able
to accomplish the viper

02:29.082 --> 02:31.716
until you have faced
your darkest fear

02:31.718 --> 02:34.051
and overcome it.

02:34.053 --> 02:36.821
Leonardo, you're just
in time to check this out.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.823
<i>[April]</i>
<i>Perhaps the most</i>
<i>baffling robbery</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:41.592
<i>in the city's history</i>
<i>was committed yesterday.</i>

02:41.594 --> 02:45.063
<i>Police don't have a clue as</i>
<i>to who the guilty party is,</i>

02:45.065 --> 02:46.698
<i>or why anyone</i>
<i>in their right mind</i>

02:46.700 --> 02:48.366
<i>would commit</i>
<i>such a robbery,</i>

02:48.368 --> 02:50.001
yet as you can see,

02:50.003 --> 02:51.436
every one
of the 600 snakes

02:51.438 --> 02:55.373
in the city zoo's reptile
house has been stolen.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.309
Ah, snakes?

02:57.311 --> 03:00.211
What kind of a nut case
would steal 600 snakes?

03:00.213 --> 03:03.281
Uh, now I'm not in the
mood for television.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.849
Maybe
I'll read a good book.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.954
Hey, that's a good idea,
Leonardo.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.721
Maybe we'll find a clue
about the robbery

03:10.723 --> 03:12.791
in my illustrated
guide to snakes.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.458
On the other hand,

03:14.460 --> 03:16.460
maybe I would
rather watch TV.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.200
It's high time we did these
dishes, Michelangelo.

03:26.405 --> 03:28.573
Aw, major gross-out.

03:28.575 --> 03:30.475
This sink
is stopped up again.

03:32.511 --> 03:33.678
Yo, Donatello,

03:33.680 --> 03:35.312
where'd you put the snake?

03:35.314 --> 03:36.213
S-S-Snake?

03:36.215 --> 03:37.348
There's a snake in here?

03:38.884 --> 03:40.118
Yeah, here it is.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.886
What's the matter
with you, Leonardo,

03:41.888 --> 03:43.555
you're as jumpy
as a cat lately.

03:43.557 --> 03:46.558
Yeah, dude, maybe you
ought to switch to decaf.

03:51.330 --> 03:52.597
Fellow turtles,

03:52.599 --> 03:55.867
this baffling mystery deserves
our undivided attention.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.134
That's right.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.203
Snake lovers everywhere
are counting on us.

03:59.205 --> 04:00.604
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

04:00.606 --> 04:02.573
<i>I'm terrified of snakes,</i>

04:02.575 --> 04:04.909
<i>but the guys look</i>
<i>to me for leadership.</i>

04:04.911 --> 04:06.410
Now, the first
thing we should do

04:06.412 --> 04:08.646
is check out the
snake house for clues.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.582
Hey, guys!

04:10.584 --> 04:12.784
Maybe we should stop
for a slice of pizza.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.685
Not now, dude.

04:14.687 --> 04:17.656
We're hot
on the snake case.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.925
Uh, anyone for hopscotch?

04:22.461 --> 04:24.929
What has gotten into you,
Leonardo?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.265
Yeah, we've got to get
to the bottom of this

04:27.267 --> 04:29.467
baffling disappearing
snake mystery.

04:29.469 --> 04:32.970
Uh, dudes, speaking
of baffling mysteries.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.177
Uh, do you see
what I see?

04:39.179 --> 04:40.177
Come on!

04:44.116 --> 04:45.150
Locked.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.818
We can get in
through that air vent.

04:50.923 --> 04:51.856
[clanks]

04:54.827 --> 04:56.127
Let's check out
that console.

04:57.896 --> 04:59.196
Snakes.

04:59.198 --> 05:01.299
Yow!

05:01.301 --> 05:03.100
Don't let that
one get away.

05:05.937 --> 05:07.071
Gotcha!

05:07.073 --> 05:09.808
Don't tell me snakes
stole all this stuff.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.742
Well, it would explain why
that piece of equipment

05:11.744 --> 05:14.645
seemed to be moving
under its own power.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.381
What do you think,
Leonardo?

05:17.383 --> 05:19.016
Uh, Leonardo?

05:19.018 --> 05:22.053
Did you ever notice what
intricate craftsmanship

05:22.055 --> 05:23.321
these old buildings have?

05:23.323 --> 05:24.989
Craftsmanship?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.957
Will you get down
from there?

05:26.959 --> 05:28.226
We've got work to do!

05:28.228 --> 05:30.628
Uh, I'd really rather not.

05:30.630 --> 05:33.531
Oh, come on,
quit clowning around.

05:34.899 --> 05:37.702
This must be one of the snakes
that was stolen from the zoo.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.438
Stolen snake stealing
electronic equipment?

05:40.440 --> 05:41.472
Makes sense to me.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.074
But what would snakes want

05:43.076 --> 05:45.243
with all these
high-tech gizmos?

05:45.245 --> 05:48.046
Well, obviously they aren't
doing it for themselves.

05:48.048 --> 05:51.883
Someone must be using some
form of snake mind control.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.384
[gagging]

05:53.386 --> 05:54.485
What's the matter,
Leonardo?

05:54.487 --> 05:56.387
Oh, nothing,

05:56.389 --> 05:57.856
just a slight headache.

05:57.858 --> 06:01.091
Whoa, this scaly, little
dude sure wants to go home.

06:01.093 --> 06:03.894
It must be under
a thought control command

06:03.896 --> 06:05.796
to return with the others.

06:05.798 --> 06:08.098
If we can slip
on this homing device,

06:08.100 --> 06:10.501
we can follow it back
to its base of operations,

06:10.503 --> 06:12.670
and catch the mastermind
behind all of this.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.004
Leave it to Donatello

06:14.006 --> 06:16.174
to have a homing device
that fits a snake.

06:16.176 --> 06:19.143
Okay, Raphael,
you help out.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.879
[hissing]

06:20.881 --> 06:22.146
There!
Now let him go.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.451
Okay, let's follow it.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.390
[sighs]
This is gonna
be a long night.

06:34.559 --> 06:36.394
[Vernon]
April? It's late.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.763
I'm tired,
and I want to go home.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.064
Come on, Vernon.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.099
Where's your
journalistic spirit?

06:42.101 --> 06:44.168
We've got to pin down
this missing snake story.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.203
[glass smashing]

06:45.205 --> 06:46.337
What was that?

06:48.406 --> 06:51.609
[April]
Somebody's breaking into
that sporting goods store.

06:51.611 --> 06:53.978
Oh, I hope
they don't see us.

06:53.980 --> 06:55.880
I just hope
we can see them.

06:57.316 --> 07:00.251
Okay, boys, you know
what the orders are.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.986
We gotta swipe
some diving gear.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.388
Right, Pinky.

07:09.127 --> 07:11.862
Leave us get out of here
before the cops arrive.

07:11.864 --> 07:13.898
It's Pinky McFingers.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.066
This is great!

07:15.068 --> 07:18.169
Oh, yeah, swell.
I have to go now.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.737
Stay put, Vernon.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.205
This is news.

07:21.207 --> 07:23.574
[April]
Hmm. Since when
are those hoodlums

07:23.576 --> 07:25.476
into aquatic sports?

07:27.846 --> 07:29.046
He's up to something,

07:29.048 --> 07:31.249
and we're going
to find out what it is.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.884
Must we?

07:34.000 --> 07:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:44.029 --> 07:45.396
They went thataway!

07:50.302 --> 07:51.903
What is this place?

07:51.905 --> 07:53.871
It's the old
botanical garden.

07:53.873 --> 07:55.139
It's been closed for years.

07:56.508 --> 07:59.510
[whistling]
Boy, talk about your
urban jungles.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.981
I know, the air
is almost tropical.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.583
Don't sweat it,
compadres.

08:05.585 --> 08:08.619
We'll find those
snakes in the grass.

08:08.621 --> 08:09.620
Whoa.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.822
Dudes, where's
the Leo-meister?

08:11.824 --> 08:13.491
Anything wrong,
Leonardo?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.493
No, everything's
just snake--

08:15.495 --> 08:16.827
I mean great.

08:20.633 --> 08:21.865
Oh, boy.

08:21.867 --> 08:23.667
Looks like the snakes
found us first.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.269
Dudes,
they're everywhere.

08:27.305 --> 08:28.605
There are
too many of them.

08:29.708 --> 08:32.109
Leonardo! Help us!

08:32.111 --> 08:35.313
But snakes scare the living
daylights out of me.

08:39.150 --> 08:40.518
Oh, terrific.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.919
Fellow dudes?

08:41.921 --> 08:45.089
I think the scales
are tipped against us.

08:51.630 --> 08:54.765
I've got a snaky suspicion
we're in big trouble.

09:04.476 --> 09:07.244
Oh, what happened?

09:07.246 --> 09:09.480
I must have fallen
through the floor.

09:10.782 --> 09:11.949
Those snakes.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.217
They got the guys.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.919
I've got to find them.

09:14.921 --> 09:19.089
But there are 600 s-snakes
somewhere around here.

09:19.091 --> 09:20.691
On second thought,

09:20.693 --> 09:22.426
I think I'll chicken out.

09:31.269 --> 09:34.238
Leonardo, what were
you doing in there?

09:34.240 --> 09:35.839
And what were you
running away from?

09:35.841 --> 09:39.109
Uh, I'll explain
it to you sometime.

09:39.111 --> 09:41.178
What are you
two doing here?

09:41.180 --> 09:44.681
Pinky McFingers and his goons
stole a bunch of scuba gear

09:44.683 --> 09:46.250
and came straight here.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.085
What's going on in there?

09:48.087 --> 09:50.021
Well, it all started
when we were passing

09:50.023 --> 09:52.456
this scientific
supply building,

09:52.458 --> 09:55.059
and there was this machine.

09:55.061 --> 09:58.796
Do you have to have all these
snakes around, Cobrato?

09:58.798 --> 10:00.064
They give me the creeps.

10:00.066 --> 10:03.300
Serpents are my friends.

10:03.302 --> 10:04.435
Yeah, sure, okay.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.704
So we swiped the diving
gear like you asked.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.205
So now what?

10:08.207 --> 10:11.008
Thanks to my snake''
stealthful robberies

10:11.010 --> 10:12.543
of the scientific
equipment,

10:12.545 --> 10:16.346
I have completed
this thermal device.

10:16.348 --> 10:18.883
Your men are to use
the scuba gear

10:18.885 --> 10:21.819
to place it at the
bottom of the East River.

10:21.821 --> 10:23.287
What good's that gonna do?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.823
I will activate the device,

10:25.825 --> 10:27.659
heating up the water,

10:27.661 --> 10:29.827
so that my
serpents can thrive

10:29.829 --> 10:32.530
in the tropical
atmosphere.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.499
You're saying that Pinky
McFingers is in there,

10:34.501 --> 10:36.868
with someone who's been
using mind control

10:36.870 --> 10:39.904
to make the stolen snakes
steal scientific equipment?

10:39.906 --> 10:43.241
Why, that makes about
as much sense as-- as--

10:43.243 --> 10:45.009
As what we're doing here.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.245
[car door opening]

10:47.247 --> 10:49.446
[April]
Now what is that thing?

10:49.448 --> 10:51.949
I don't know, but we'd
better find out.

10:54.686 --> 10:55.853
Wait!

10:55.855 --> 10:56.954
You said
the other turtles

10:56.956 --> 10:59.090
were trapped in that
building somewhere!

10:59.092 --> 11:00.625
Aren't we going
to rescue them?

11:00.627 --> 11:02.026
Uh, right.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.795
Well, you see I--

11:04.797 --> 11:07.532
If three turtles couldn't
get past those snakes,

11:07.534 --> 11:10.034
what chance would one
turtle and two humans have?

11:10.036 --> 11:12.837
Right. Right.
Good thinking, Vernon.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.773
Now follow that limo!

11:15.775 --> 11:16.974
[engine starting]

11:18.610 --> 11:20.178
My inner vision tells me

11:20.180 --> 11:23.447
that Leonardo stumbled
upon his greatest fear

11:23.449 --> 11:25.816
and lacks the courage
to confront it.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.251
The lesson he must learn

11:27.253 --> 11:29.187
is that to conquer
one's fears,

11:29.189 --> 11:32.190
one must face them,
not run away.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.995
Now make sure
you plant that thing

11:37.997 --> 11:39.564
at the very
bottom of the river.

11:42.634 --> 11:44.502
Forget it,
McFingers!

11:44.504 --> 11:46.771
Your underwater
caper is all wet!

11:46.773 --> 11:49.473
Why,
you rotten reptile.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.440
It's curtains
for you.

11:50.442 --> 11:54.311
Thanks, but I prefer
Venetian blinds!

12:05.157 --> 12:06.323
That ought to hold you.

12:12.397 --> 12:13.564
Uh-oh.

12:15.433 --> 12:19.102
Two more fish
for today's catch.

12:19.104 --> 12:20.538
All right, Pinky.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.707
What was that device your men
just dropped in the river?

12:23.709 --> 12:25.409
It's got something
to do with the guy

12:25.411 --> 12:26.744
in the botanical gardens,

12:26.746 --> 12:30.414
a guy with a snake
fixation, doesn't it?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.849
Yeah, that's right,

12:31.851 --> 12:33.284
but I don't know
what the gizmo does.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.519
Who's the guy?

12:34.521 --> 12:36.286
His name
is Rudolph Cobrato,

12:36.288 --> 12:37.722
and I ain't saying
anything else

12:37.724 --> 12:39.657
without a witness
protection program.

12:39.659 --> 12:42.226
[Cobrato]
McFingers must have
placed the device

12:42.228 --> 12:43.994
in the river by now.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.796
[hissing]

12:45.798 --> 12:48.399
Now, my beloved serpents,

12:48.401 --> 12:51.502
I will activate the device,
heating up the water,

12:51.504 --> 12:53.738
so that you can
take your place

12:53.740 --> 12:57.241
as the rightful
rulers of this city!

13:00.512 --> 13:02.713
[beeping]

13:05.016 --> 13:09.286
Soon, the city
will be ours!

13:10.455 --> 13:11.722
Did you hear that?

13:11.724 --> 13:13.924
Yeah. It sounds
like that gizmo's

13:13.926 --> 13:15.893
about to make things
hot for the citizens.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.094
We've got to stop him.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.595
But, like,
how do we do that

13:18.597 --> 13:22.132
when we're stuck in this
humongous reptile cage?

13:22.134 --> 13:23.467
Well, there's got
to be a way out somehow.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.737
Hey, maybe Leonardo
will come rescue us.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.105
With his fear of snakes?

13:28.107 --> 13:29.507
Forget it.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.475
The poor guy won't come
anywhere near this place.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.244
Hey, hold on.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.346
There may be
a way out after all.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.281
This cage has no base.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.682
It's merely bolted
to the floor.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.918
If we can get
all these bolts loose,

13:40.920 --> 13:42.853
we could just pick
the whole thing up

13:42.855 --> 13:44.121
and get out of here.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.123
Great. Anybody got
a screwdriver?

13:46.125 --> 13:47.592
Uh, no.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.793
Hey, how about my
grappling hook?

13:49.795 --> 13:51.128
Well, it's better
than nothing.

13:52.931 --> 13:55.099
Aw, dude, it's like
you'll have to unloosen

13:55.101 --> 13:56.667
a bazillion of these things

13:56.669 --> 13:58.102
just to get us loose.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.604
Look, will you stop worrying?

13:59.606 --> 14:00.938
We'll get out of here.

14:00.940 --> 14:03.908
Oh, sure,
in a couple of weeks.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.278
I don't think the police
will get anything more

14:07.280 --> 14:08.779
out of Pinky than I did.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.580
I've checked with
the newsroom files

14:10.582 --> 14:12.149
on this
Rudolph Cobrato.

14:12.151 --> 14:14.084
He was a famous
herpetologist.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.853
What, you mean
he studied herbs?

14:15.855 --> 14:16.954
No.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.722
A herpetologist
is a scientist

14:18.724 --> 14:21.058
who specializes
in reptiles and snakes.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.559
Uh? Snakes?

14:22.561 --> 14:25.129
But last year,
Cobrato vanished

14:25.131 --> 14:27.597
after a lab accident
with some snake venom.

14:27.599 --> 14:29.466
No one's heard
from him since.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.868
Until now.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.504
Leonardo, the only way we'll
get to the bottom of this

14:33.506 --> 14:35.406
is to go back
to the botanical gardens.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.208
Uh, back?

14:37.210 --> 14:40.044
It's the only way we'll
rescue the other turtles.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.245
Uh, rescue?

14:41.247 --> 14:42.146
Leonardo,

14:42.148 --> 14:44.782
what in the world
is the matter with you?

14:44.784 --> 14:46.584
I hate to tell you this,

14:46.586 --> 14:48.852
but I have this paralyzing
fear of snakes.

14:48.854 --> 14:51.254
The last time
I saw one, I fainted.

14:51.256 --> 14:53.624
Ha ha ha ha!
You're a scaredy turtle.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.226
Ha ha! That's rich.

14:56.995 --> 15:01.932
Okay, then,<i> you</i> go deal
with those 600 snakes.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.200
On second thought,

15:03.202 --> 15:04.801
that's quite understandable.

15:04.803 --> 15:06.403
What are we going to do?

15:06.405 --> 15:07.872
Last time,
we rescued you.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.707
Now it's your turn.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.843
Leonardo, I think
you'd better talk
to Splinter about this.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.346
Maybe he'll have
some kind of solution.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.580
I hope you're right.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.682
[Leonardo]
Drop me off
at the sewers.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.584
I'll get in touch
with you later.

15:34.399 --> 15:35.966
[Splinter]
So I was right.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.802
You do have a hidden fear:

15:37.804 --> 15:39.770
a fear of snakes.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.439
Yes,
Master Splinter.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.208
I never realized
the fear was so deep.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.575
And this
is what prevented you

15:45.577 --> 15:48.112
from performing the viper
maneuver correctly.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.981
Oh, I don't care about
the viper maneuver anymore.

15:50.983 --> 15:52.850
I just want
to save the others.

15:52.852 --> 15:55.352
Couldn't you
just hypnotize me

15:55.354 --> 15:57.121
into not being
afraid of snakes?

15:57.123 --> 15:58.989
No, my pupil.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.158
If the hypnotic effect
should wear off,

16:01.160 --> 16:02.693
you could be
in grave danger.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.061
Then it's hopeless.

16:04.063 --> 16:05.830
On the contrary, Leonardo.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.731
You have been given
the opportunity

16:07.733 --> 16:10.367
to confront
your deepest fear.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.570
Seize it, and you will
be free of it forever.

16:13.572 --> 16:16.373
If I don't pass out
from fright first.

16:20.945 --> 16:23.614
I like warm weather
as much as the next guy,

16:23.616 --> 16:25.316
but this is ridiculous!

16:25.318 --> 16:28.619
Oh, it must be that device
of Cobrato's in the river.

16:28.621 --> 16:31.622
I only hope Leonardo found
the courage to deal with him.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.356
[Raphael]
Come on, Donatello,
hurry!

16:33.358 --> 16:35.392
I'm going
as fast as I can,

16:35.394 --> 16:37.261
but we're still
only halfway through.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.429
Well, work mondo
fast, dude.

16:39.431 --> 16:40.564
While we're stuck in here,

16:40.566 --> 16:42.800
the city's
going to the snakes.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.035
What am I going to do?

16:45.037 --> 16:46.804
I want to confront my fear,

16:46.806 --> 16:48.172
but I'm afraid to.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.140
Hey, what's going on?

16:50.142 --> 16:51.909
How come it's so hot?

16:51.911 --> 16:53.109
I don't know,

16:53.111 --> 16:55.012
but I'm getting scared.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.780
Hey, look!

16:56.782 --> 17:00.817
Whoa, it's one of the Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles!

17:00.819 --> 17:04.255
Leonardo, you've
got to save the city!

17:04.257 --> 17:06.223
I can't. I'm sorry.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.459
But the whole city
is boiling hot.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.394
You've got
to do something.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.730
Please,
just leave me alone.

17:12.732 --> 17:15.298
And you call yourself
a hero.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.467
Yeah, you're just
a big chicken.

17:18.536 --> 17:20.270
Me? Chicken?

17:20.271 --> 17:21.739
No way!

17:21.741 --> 17:23.273
Now you kids stay cool

17:23.276 --> 17:25.509
while I go bust
some bad guys!

17:25.511 --> 17:26.710
All right!

17:26.712 --> 17:28.244
That's the Leonardo
we know.

17:28.247 --> 17:30.514
Go Green Machine!

17:30.516 --> 17:32.849
Turtle power!

17:40.391 --> 17:43.427
Okay, Leonardo,
don't be afraid.

17:43.429 --> 17:47.063
After all, snakes and turtles
are both reptiles.

17:47.065 --> 17:49.966
Why should I be afraid
of a fellow species?

17:49.968 --> 17:53.270
Because they're totally
scary, that's why!

17:53.272 --> 17:55.205
Yee-ow!

17:55.207 --> 17:57.674
<i>[Splinter]</i>
<i>Only by confronting</i>
<i>your fear</i>

17:57.676 --> 18:00.077
<i>can you be free of it.</i>

18:00.079 --> 18:03.814
Of course, I could get
strangled by a python.

18:06.818 --> 18:09.153
No. I won't let you
frighten me.

18:13.024 --> 18:14.391
I did it!

18:14.393 --> 18:17.094
I made it past
all those snakes!

18:17.096 --> 18:18.695
I'm not afraid anymore.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.598
All right, Cobrato!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.933
Prepare to get busted.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.035
Oh, really?

18:25.037 --> 18:29.339
Since when could a mere
turtle defeat a snake?

18:31.609 --> 18:34.712
I d-don't believe it.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.246
[hissing]

18:36.248 --> 18:39.115
Does my appearance
disturb you?

18:39.117 --> 18:40.450
I've looked this way

18:40.452 --> 18:44.020
ever since my snake venom
experiment.

18:44.022 --> 18:45.122
[hissing]

18:45.124 --> 18:48.492
Now I no longer
study snakes.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.361
I am one with them.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.929
They obey me.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.597
I am their ruler,

18:53.599 --> 18:56.766
and,
like any good ruler,

18:56.768 --> 18:59.836
I want the best
for my subjects.

18:59.838 --> 19:01.604
Thanks
to my thermal device,

19:01.606 --> 19:05.342
the entire city will soon be
turned into a tropical swamp.

19:05.344 --> 19:08.512
The humans must flee
or perish,

19:08.514 --> 19:10.914
leaving behind
a perfect environment

19:10.916 --> 19:13.350
for me and my snake legions.

19:13.352 --> 19:16.787
As for you and your
three friends,

19:16.789 --> 19:21.391
well, snakes are
superior to turtles

19:21.393 --> 19:24.228
in every way.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.062
What?

19:25.064 --> 19:26.563
All right, buddy.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.899
I've had just about
enough of your lip!

19:32.837 --> 19:35.706
No! I won't let you
do this to the city!

19:39.444 --> 19:41.711
The viper maneuver.

19:41.713 --> 19:43.613
Spine like a serpent,

19:43.615 --> 19:45.416
then like steel,

19:45.418 --> 19:46.850
strike!

19:53.825 --> 19:56.927
Try slithering your way
out of this, snake eyes.

19:58.596 --> 19:59.997
Hah!

19:59.999 --> 20:02.666
Come quickly, my snakes.

20:02.668 --> 20:06.736
I need you, all of you.

20:06.738 --> 20:07.704
Whew!

20:07.706 --> 20:09.739
There, that's
the last one.

20:09.741 --> 20:10.941
Triumphant!

20:10.943 --> 20:12.842
Now let's get
out of this thing.

20:15.346 --> 20:16.280
Okay, guys.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.682
Everybody lift!

20:18.684 --> 20:20.250
Relax, guys.

20:20.252 --> 20:22.352
Why don't you just
use the door?

20:22.354 --> 20:23.654
It sure took you
long enough.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.122
Leonardo.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.290
How did you make it
past all those snakes?

20:27.292 --> 20:29.493
I made an important
realization.

20:29.495 --> 20:32.228
Fears are just in our minds.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.765
We have the power
to overcome them.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.399
Righteous, dude.

20:36.401 --> 20:39.069
Can you really lift up that
cage and carry it around?

20:39.071 --> 20:42.239
Sure, now that we went
to all that needless work.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.308
We may have a use
for that thing yet.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.777
You and Michelangelo
carry it into the lab.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.445
Donatello,
you come with me.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.616
We've got to
shut down the controls
to that thermal device

20:52.618 --> 20:55.085
before the whole city
gets parboiled.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.386
I think they're
over there.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.288
Now to put this thing
out of commission.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.324
Ahh!
No, I won't let you.

21:01.326 --> 21:03.126
No! Augh!

21:03.128 --> 21:05.095
Get this crawling
creep off me.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.196
Clear out, slime ball!

21:26.216 --> 21:29.252
No, I'm normal again.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.621
Yeah. It's a regular
miracle.

21:31.623 --> 21:35.893
But I loved being a snake.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.796
[Donatello]
Uh, I think we
have a little problem.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.365
No, my faithful followers.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.300
Not me. Them!

21:43.302 --> 21:44.635
[hissing]

21:44.637 --> 21:47.270
I don't think he can
control them anymore.

21:47.272 --> 21:48.872
Listen to me.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.808
I only wanted
the best for you.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.309
Hang on, amigos.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.510
Here comes the cavalry.

21:53.512 --> 21:55.846
[Donatello]
Move it with that
thing, guys.

22:02.153 --> 22:03.620
My snakes.

22:03.622 --> 22:04.888
[crying]

22:04.890 --> 22:06.490
How could you betray me?

22:06.492 --> 22:08.125
Well, maybe they didn't
like being bossed around

22:08.127 --> 22:09.259
by a jerk like you.

22:09.261 --> 22:11.095
Hit it, Donatello.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.240
Ah, Cobrato?

22:23.242 --> 22:25.175
I'd say your little
plan for conquest

22:25.177 --> 22:27.410
just came up <i> snake eyes.</i>

22:30.648 --> 22:33.516
[Splinter]
This is a moment of triumph
for you, Leonardo.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.584
From now on,

22:34.586 --> 22:37.154
you will never fear
snakes again.

22:37.156 --> 22:39.122
Thanks to you,
Master Splinter.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.057
After today, I'm glad
that none of us

22:41.059 --> 22:43.293
even has to think
about snakes again.

22:43.295 --> 22:45.261
<i>And now,</i>
<i>for tonight's movie--</i>

22:49.199 --> 22:51.234
Hey, where
are you guys going?

22:51.236 --> 22:53.737
It looks like a pretty
cool movie to me.

22:53.739 --> 22:57.306
Yeah, maybe I'll
just snuggle up
with a good book.

23:00.845 --> 23:04.214
Aw, just because I'm not
afraid of snakes anymore

23:04.216 --> 23:06.383
doesn't mean
I have to like them.
