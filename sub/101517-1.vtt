WEBVTT

02:22.802 --> 02:23.936
Uh, what is it?

02:25.638 --> 02:26.939
<i>Dylan just sent me
a picture of his dick.</i>

02:26.973 --> 02:28.007
Seriously?

02:29.441 --> 02:31.811
<i>Yeah. I think he's gonna
ask me to be his girlfriend.</i>

02:31.844 --> 02:33.746
<i>I mean don't you think so
if he sent that?</i>

02:34.379 --> 02:37.049
Well, how would I know?
I can't seem to get a boyfriend.

02:37.083 --> 02:39.919
<i>Chelsea, you would if you'd
just put yourself out there.</i>

02:39.952 --> 02:42.587
So anyway, did you send him
a pic like that, too?

02:42.621 --> 02:45.024
<i>Yeah, we swapped a few.</i>

02:46.893 --> 02:49.461
What if he
shows his friends?

02:49.896 --> 02:51.063
<i>I don't think
he would do that.</i>

02:52.497 --> 02:54.466
Well how do you know you can trust him?
You're not even dating yet.

02:54.901 --> 02:55.935
<i>You're right.</i>

02:57.670 --> 02:59.404
<i>I'm gonna send
his dick pic to you.</i>

02:59.437 --> 03:02.474
No! No, no, no! Ew.
I don't want to see his thing!

03:03.643 --> 03:06.045
Ugh. Okay, I gotta go.
I'll see you at school.

03:07.647 --> 03:09.548
Yeah, she's such a bitch.

03:18.423 --> 03:23.062
- Getting an early start?
- Not really. It's almost October.

03:23.095 --> 03:25.131
- Oh, whatever works.
- Oh.

03:25.164 --> 03:28.968
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, we can't forget this.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.937
Oh, Mom, I thought
I got rid of that.

03:30.970 --> 03:33.639
Oh, gosh, it's so precious.

03:33.673 --> 03:37.475
Someday you will thank me for
pulling this out of the trash.

03:38.044 --> 03:40.445
Whatever, ho.
She's your friend.

03:41.781 --> 03:43.716
Mom, can you please
take me to school today?

03:43.749 --> 03:45.584
Not when Kristina is
already driving there, no.

03:45.617 --> 03:47.887
Mom, I can't stand riding with
her. Please, please?

03:47.920 --> 03:50.488
Honestly, what is
the problem with you two?

03:50.522 --> 03:53.826
It's her and her elitist stuck-up
friends, that's the problem.

03:53.860 --> 03:57.730
Look, I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to work this out, okay?

03:57.763 --> 03:59.564
Have a good day at school.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.001
She shouldn't even
be on our team.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.502
I mean, she sucks
and she knows it.

04:06.005 --> 04:07.974
Gotta go.

04:09.075 --> 04:11.509
Oh!

04:11.543 --> 04:14.914
- Oh, he's cute. Can I talk to him?
- Give it to me.

04:17.717 --> 04:19.919
Shit! Not again!

04:20.887 --> 04:23.756
- So, who is he?
- I don't know.

04:23.789 --> 04:25.725
Oh, so you have
a secret admirer.

04:25.758 --> 04:28.794
No. I don't.
Okay, can we just go?

04:50.950 --> 04:52.584
Maybe she wants to come.

04:52.952 --> 04:54.654
That's you.
It's such a you quote.

04:56.722 --> 04:58.958
If alcohol is involved,
I am in.

04:58.991 --> 05:01.093
Always, bro. Always.

05:06.498 --> 05:08.734
Then we can go back to my house
and watch Santiago.

05:08.768 --> 05:10.670
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

05:10.703 --> 05:12.470
- Yeah, yeah.
- You down?

05:12.504 --> 05:14.674
- I'm down.
- Alright.

05:17.877 --> 05:19.611
What was that all about?

05:19.645 --> 05:21.881
There's a change
of plans for tonight.

05:21.914 --> 05:23.481
Wait, what?

05:23.515 --> 05:26.218
Dylan just asked me
to go over to his house.

05:26.252 --> 05:29.021
But we never skip movie night.
For anything.

05:29.055 --> 05:32.658
His parents are going to be gone.
Don't worry.

05:32.692 --> 05:36.062
Dylan said Seth's gonna be there, so you
can come too, and we can all watch a movie.

05:36.095 --> 05:38.698
You know I hate being
forced into social situations.

05:38.731 --> 05:41.499
He knows you're gonna be there
and said he'd show up.

05:41.533 --> 05:44.904
Seth? Seriously?
He's barely ever talked to me.

05:44.937 --> 05:46.939
How could you tell him
I was already going?

05:46.973 --> 05:49.507
He said he wanted
to hang out with you.

05:49.541 --> 05:52.878
And besides,
I knew you'd help me out.

05:52.912 --> 05:54.714
With what?

05:55.681 --> 05:57.984
You guys stay in the
living room watching the movie

05:58.017 --> 06:01.187
while Dylan and I
go to his bedroom.

06:01.220 --> 06:04.522
- Okay, wait. Me, alone with Seth?
- You'll be fine.

06:04.556 --> 06:06.792
It'll only be for a few minutes.

06:06.826 --> 06:08.928
Okay, wait. Are you sure
you're even ready for that?

06:08.961 --> 06:12.798
Yeah, I mean, well, we've
basically seen each other naked

06:12.832 --> 06:14.300
with all the pictures
we've shared.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.601
Okay, yeah, ew.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.242
<i>You fucking scared?</i>

06:23.275 --> 06:24.677
<i>Act your way out of this, huh?</i>

06:25.911 --> 06:28.681
<i>Come on. Act like you ain't.
Come on!</i>

06:35.721 --> 06:38.824
- Sure. You want to?
- Hm.

07:17.029 --> 07:19.331
Bottoms up!

07:22.134 --> 07:23.803
Oh, wow.

07:35.881 --> 07:40.352
Um, so what kind of
music do you listen to?

07:41.821 --> 07:43.956
I like a lot of music, so.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.235
Um...

08:00.239 --> 08:01.907
Do you like the movie?

08:03.109 --> 08:05.344
I'm actually more
interested in you.

08:06.946 --> 08:09.748
I mean, look at this.
Look at what you've done.

08:10.950 --> 08:13.919
Chelsea, seriously,
I'm gonna be really mad at you

08:13.953 --> 08:15.254
if you don't tell me
what happened.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.089
I really don't want to
talk about it.

08:17.123 --> 08:19.892
Ugh, come on,
who else are you gonna tell? Please?

08:19.925 --> 08:22.628
I mean, I'm sure Seth already
told him what happened.

08:24.396 --> 08:28.934
Okay, fine. I totally
freaked out last night.

08:28.968 --> 08:31.837
What happened?
We were only gone for like ten minutes.

08:31.871 --> 08:34.106
Seth tried to
get me to go down on him.

08:34.140 --> 08:38.377
I pushed him off and then I ran out.
I'm so embarrassed.

08:42.014 --> 08:44.450
- I think that's all he wanted.
- You should have just done it.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.919
Ew, Mia. No. I can't even
believe you did that to Dylan.

08:46.952 --> 08:49.455
- You're not even technically together, are you?
- We are now.

08:49.488 --> 08:52.291
- Dylan asked me out last night.
- How romantic.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.692
Hello, ladies.

08:53.726 --> 08:55.127
-Hey.

08:55.161 --> 08:57.263
Chelsea, I heard
you choked last night.

08:57.296 --> 08:59.098
That's not funny, Dylan.

08:59.131 --> 09:01.100
I'm just playin'.

09:01.133 --> 09:03.969
You don't worry. After you left,
Seth got so drunk

09:04.003 --> 09:06.005
he probably doesn't
remember anything.

09:17.283 --> 09:19.485
- I know.
- I missed you.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.287
Yeah, I missed you too.

09:43.442 --> 09:45.211
Give it up.

09:46.145 --> 09:48.214
I wasn't doing anything.
I was just holding it.

09:48.247 --> 09:50.316
- Hand it over, Chelsea.
- I'm sorry. I'll put it away.

09:50.349 --> 09:53.285
- Please?
- Sorry. Rules are rules.

10:10.936 --> 10:12.805
Mom, it's not fair.

10:12.838 --> 10:14.807
The school year just started,
and this is the second time

10:14.840 --> 10:16.875
I had to go to the principal's
office to get your phone.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.944
Yeah, but a whole month?

10:18.978 --> 10:21.780
Chelsea, he said the next time this
happened, you would be suspended.

10:21.814 --> 10:22.915
I wish Dad was home.

10:22.948 --> 10:25.217
Yeah.

10:25.251 --> 10:27.486
You think that he would like to hear that
you haven't been following the rules?

10:51.310 --> 10:52.811
Come in.

10:58.484 --> 10:59.985
Oh, my God, did you find one?

11:00.019 --> 11:01.820
It works,
but it has a small screen.

11:01.854 --> 11:03.889
Oh, my gosh, I don't care.
You've literally saved my life.

11:03.922 --> 11:07.826
- If your mom finds out, you didn't get it from me, okay?
- Of course.

11:07.860 --> 11:10.195
Okay. I gotta get going.

11:10.229 --> 11:13.032
- What? Why?
- I'm going to go see Dylan.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.468
Please don't be mad at me.

11:16.502 --> 11:18.604
Okay, you know what?
Don't worry about me.

11:18.638 --> 11:20.005
Okay, you sound mad.

11:20.039 --> 11:22.308
No. Go and have your fun.

11:22.341 --> 11:24.176
You obviously don't care
about anyone else but Dylan.

11:24.209 --> 11:25.511
How can you even say that?

11:27.513 --> 11:29.315
You know what?

11:31.651 --> 11:33.285
You're welcome for the phone.

12:32.645 --> 12:34.046
Oh, shit.

12:42.354 --> 12:45.424
Mom, where's Kristina?

12:45.457 --> 12:47.559
She went to
Tracy's house to study.

12:47.593 --> 12:49.128
Yeah, sure she did.

13:26.231 --> 13:27.366
Oh, shit!

13:53.793 --> 13:56.562
Uh, hello?

13:56.595 --> 13:57.630
<i>Hi.</i>

13:58.765 --> 14:00.599
I can't see you very well.

14:02.167 --> 14:04.570
<i>Yeah, I know.
I dropped my phone too many times,</i>

14:04.603 --> 14:07.573
<i>and my parents won't buy me
another one until next year.</i>

14:08.741 --> 14:11.076
Uh, can you see me?

14:12.277 --> 14:16.716
<i>Yeah. And, wow!</i>

14:22.454 --> 14:25.692
<i>Yeah. I think my parents are
going to get me a car for my eighteenth birthday.</i>

14:25.725 --> 14:28.661
Oh, nice!
Uh, What kind do you want?

14:28.695 --> 14:32.632
<i>Something fast, but I think
I'm just going to get their SUV.</i>

14:32.665 --> 14:35.768
If you get one, maybe
we can go out on a real date.

14:35.802 --> 14:38.170
<i>Oh, so now you're ready
to go on a date.</i>

14:38.203 --> 14:41.406
I think so, now that
I know you better.

14:41.440 --> 14:43.108
<i>We don't have to wait.</i>

14:43.843 --> 14:45.544
Oh, we don't?

14:45.577 --> 14:47.446
<i>I can take a bus.</i>

14:47.479 --> 14:49.481
Well, where would we meet?

14:49.515 --> 14:53.085
How about your house?
I can meet your mom and your sister.

14:53.118 --> 14:55.254
<i>Are you kidding? No way.</i>

14:55.287 --> 14:58.156
<i>I haven't told anyone about you
yet. Why not your place?</i>

14:58.190 --> 15:00.793
Yeah, my parents don't know
anything about you either.

15:00.827 --> 15:02.561
Uh...

15:02.594 --> 15:04.363
How about somewhere in between?

15:04.396 --> 15:06.298
<i>Okay. As long as
I can take a bus, too.</i>

15:06.331 --> 15:08.200
Would you like to
bring your friend, Mia?

15:08.233 --> 15:10.670
Mia's too
self-absorbed with Dylan.

15:10.703 --> 15:13.238
Besides, she would think
I was crazy or desperate

15:13.272 --> 15:14.774
if I saw a guy
I met through an app.

15:14.807 --> 15:16.208
<i>What do you think about that?</i>

15:16.241 --> 15:18.477
That I must be crazy.

15:18.510 --> 15:21.113
I mean, I know we haven't
seen each other in person,

15:21.146 --> 15:24.550
but I feel like we know more about each
other than people who meet normally.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.153
- What?
- I'm all finished. Can we eat now?

15:28.186 --> 15:30.455
<i>Go away!
I said not to bother me.</i>

15:30.489 --> 15:34.827
Sorry.
Uh, that was my sister.

15:34.861 --> 15:37.429
My foster sister, Sadie.

15:37.462 --> 15:40.767
Oh I, I didn't know you had a sister?
She's adopted?

15:40.800 --> 15:44.303
<i>No. Actually, I was.</i>

15:47.172 --> 15:49.508
Sounds like
she gets on your nerves.

15:49.541 --> 15:54.647
<i>Well, she's not, perfect.</i>

15:54.681 --> 15:56.816
Well, I'm... I'm not either.

15:56.849 --> 15:58.450
<i>You could be
perfect for me.</i>

16:00.185 --> 16:02.254
- <i>I have an idea.</i>
- <i>What is it?</i>

16:02.287 --> 16:05.190
Halloween is this Friday.
I saw an ad for a warehouse party

16:05.223 --> 16:06.525
we could both take a bus to.

16:06.558 --> 16:08.327
We can get dressed up
and everything.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.263
Okay, what would I go as?

16:11.296 --> 16:13.833
<i>How about
a zombie cheerleader?</i>

16:13.866 --> 16:16.636
Okay,
and what would you go as?

16:16.669 --> 16:18.403
A zombie quarterback.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.539
Could be fun.

16:20.572 --> 16:22.274
Hey, is Mia still coming over?

16:22.307 --> 16:25.344
Uh, no. She's going
to Dylan's Halloween party.

16:25.377 --> 16:26.813
You're not
going to go with her?

16:26.846 --> 16:28.781
No, I don't
want to go anywhere.

16:28.815 --> 16:31.516
- I think I'm just gonna stay here and pass out candy.
- Okay.

16:31.550 --> 16:34.854
Well, I will be back in
the morning around seven.

16:34.887 --> 16:37.890
- Love you. Oh, hi! Giddy-up!
- Okay.

16:39.726 --> 16:41.593
And, who are you
supposed to be?

16:41.628 --> 16:45.597
Jessie, the Cowgirl
from Toy Story. Duh.

16:45.632 --> 16:47.432
Brendon's going as Woody.

16:47.466 --> 16:50.703
Oh, okay, I hope his Woody's
more covered than you are.

16:50.737 --> 16:53.305
Aren't you the funny one?

16:53.338 --> 16:54.841
Have fun playing with
yourself tonight.

17:00.545 --> 17:02.447
What are you even doing?

17:02.481 --> 17:06.819
Um, trying to
look like a zombie?

17:08.721 --> 17:11.256
Here, I'll help you with it.

17:55.267 --> 17:57.970
- Boo!
- Oh, my God. You're such an asshole!

17:58.004 --> 18:01.506
And you are the most beautiful
dead girl I've ever seen.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.308
Thank you.

18:03.743 --> 18:06.611
- Did you bring any alcohol?
- Uh, no. I... I didn't.

18:06.646 --> 18:09.916
- You said you like screwdrivers, right?
- Yeah, totally.

18:09.949 --> 18:11.918
Come on. I got some.

18:16.022 --> 18:17.489
Here, right here.

18:22.461 --> 18:26.431
Thanks. I can't. Um...

18:27.299 --> 18:29.301
Oh, yeah.

18:30.368 --> 18:33.238
I... I just need to make sure
I get home before midnight.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.875
Whenever you need to leave,
just let me know.

18:44.016 --> 18:48.520
- Um... Oh wow!
- Yeah!

18:54.861 --> 18:56.996
- Let's go.
- Oh, wait!

18:57.029 --> 18:59.732
We don't want to get caught
with alcohol on the street.

18:59.766 --> 19:03.803
- Let's just finish it here.
- Uh, sure.

19:06.672 --> 19:08.440
- Okay.
- Cheers!

19:13.545 --> 19:16.481
You know, it's weird
that I can't see your face.

19:22.121 --> 19:24.957
Oh, wow, that, that hit me fast.

19:24.991 --> 19:27.760
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

19:31.764 --> 19:34.499
- Here, come this way.
- W... where?

19:34.533 --> 19:36.669
We can sit in my car
until you feel better.

19:38.037 --> 19:41.439
I thought
you took a bus, too.

19:43.441 --> 19:46.946
Ooh, zombie cheerleader. Hot!

19:49.849 --> 19:54.120
- Oh.
- Dude, she is wasted!

19:56.789 --> 19:57.957
Hey, is she okay?

20:04.130 --> 20:06.498
- Come on!
- What, wait...

20:06.531 --> 20:09.534
No, no. Come on. Come on.
This way, this way, this way, this way.

20:10.903 --> 20:11.971
I got you.

20:30.422 --> 20:31.891
Here.

22:25.071 --> 22:30.042
Please. No, no.
Please don't hurt me. Please don't.

22:30.076 --> 22:31.811
Be still.

22:34.947 --> 22:36.682
Brad?

22:40.119 --> 22:43.621
Please, let me go home.
Please?

23:17.023 --> 23:18.090
Good morning, Sadie.

23:19.859 --> 23:22.061
Brad, you know
my name is Chelsea.

23:30.302 --> 23:35.107
Your name, is... Sadie now.

23:52.358 --> 23:53.591
Hi.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.666
Come here, Little buddy.

24:01.934 --> 24:03.669
Do you like that name?

24:04.737 --> 24:06.072
Little Buddy?

24:08.941 --> 24:12.945
No, no, no! No don't go. Please!
No! Please!

24:35.668 --> 24:36.368
Now...

24:39.271 --> 24:41.140
what's your name?

24:41.173 --> 24:42.675
Come on.

24:43.676 --> 24:45.377
You're a smart girl.

24:45.411 --> 24:49.148
Apparently, it's Sadie.

24:50.749 --> 24:52.751
Sarcasm is disrespectful.

24:59.258 --> 25:02.027
I'm, I'm, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

25:03.262 --> 25:06.932
I'll be good. I promise.

25:09.401 --> 25:13.806
You see? It's not that hard.

25:26.318 --> 25:27.753
Eat up.

25:36.328 --> 25:38.797
Disgusting.

25:45.137 --> 25:48.073
No! No! No!

26:04.123 --> 26:09.128
Wait. Wait.

26:09.161 --> 26:11.096
Who are you?

26:12.398 --> 26:13.899
I'm Sadie.

26:17.136 --> 26:19.338
- You're Sadie?
- Yes.

26:24.043 --> 26:27.880
- Thank God. Thank God. I'm...
- Sadie.

26:28.781 --> 26:31.050
From now on,
your name is Sadie.

26:34.987 --> 26:37.890
- You're letting me go?
- Brad is.

26:39.191 --> 26:40.926
Why are you helping him?

27:24.970 --> 27:26.405
Please!

27:28.907 --> 27:30.142
Why are you hurting me?

27:31.443 --> 27:33.479
I'm stopping us
from getting into trouble.

27:33.512 --> 27:35.281
Are you going to behave?

27:35.314 --> 27:37.349
Okay! Okay!

27:43.489 --> 27:46.058
Grab that rug rake
and rake the living room.

27:55.501 --> 27:57.303
If you are the last person
in a room,

27:57.336 --> 27:59.571
make sure the carpet is perfect
when you leave.

28:01.140 --> 28:03.575
Everything must always
stay neat and clean.

28:58.497 --> 29:01.033
Come in. Don't be shy.

29:09.108 --> 29:10.275
What's your name?

29:10.677 --> 29:12.411
S... Sadie.

29:16.315 --> 29:17.516
Your real name.

29:26.024 --> 29:27.493
It's Sadie.

29:28.127 --> 29:29.128
Good girl.

29:31.631 --> 29:33.532
You know what to do.

29:33.565 --> 29:35.635
Aren't you going to help?

29:35.668 --> 29:38.270
I'm making Brad's favorite
cake for dinner.

29:48.013 --> 29:49.381
Strip down.

29:50.817 --> 29:55.053
Believe me. You do not want to go
down to dinner looking like that.

29:55.087 --> 29:57.189
Your uniform has to be cleaned.

30:14.473 --> 30:17.543
All the way down.
Those need to be washed as well.

30:18.544 --> 30:20.078
I can do it myself.

30:22.347 --> 30:25.551
Take them off.
And get into the tub.

30:50.209 --> 30:52.144
You need to bleach
your hair now.

30:52.177 --> 30:53.312
What? Why?

30:56.348 --> 30:58.283
Because Brad says so.

30:59.084 --> 31:02.488
Everything is because
Brad says so.

32:45.624 --> 32:47.092
Oh, my God.

32:59.605 --> 33:01.406
What... what happened to you?

33:03.342 --> 33:06.311
- You slut.
- What?

33:06.345 --> 33:11.450
Get out!
Get out, you backstabbing whore!

33:23.228 --> 33:29.669
Don't. No, no, no, no.

33:54.827 --> 33:56.663
Do you like what you see?

34:07.305 --> 34:08.975
Get out of here, you perv.

34:09.008 --> 34:10.743
Mom!

34:10.777 --> 34:14.379
Sadie.

35:37.462 --> 35:40.465
I know what you're doing,
Sadie.

35:55.882 --> 35:58.517
Is this what you want, Sadie?

35:58.550 --> 35:59.618
Hmm?

36:01.353 --> 36:04.757
Yes. I always have.

36:33.953 --> 36:35.788
Have you seen her yet?

36:37.422 --> 36:38.390
I did.

36:39.892 --> 36:41.359
What happened to you?

36:41.393 --> 36:43.029
Kitchen accident.

36:43.062 --> 36:44.596
Totally my fault.

36:46.866 --> 36:48.768
Here, put these on.

36:50.803 --> 36:53.105
Make sure you wear them
every time you leave your room.

36:58.077 --> 36:59.679
She... she needs a doctor.

36:59.712 --> 37:01.948
It's not gonna happen.

37:01.981 --> 37:04.150
She's gonna die
if she doesn't get help.

37:04.183 --> 37:07.720
Brad's not stupid. He knows
he can't take her anywhere.

37:08.754 --> 37:10.923
He says we have to nurse her
back to health.

37:10.957 --> 37:14.660
I don't know why everyone is just
going along like this isn't nuts, okay.

37:14.694 --> 37:16.929
Has anyone even tried
to find a way out?

37:17.730 --> 37:20.900
Don't talk about that.
With anyone.

37:22.101 --> 37:24.971
You just saw what happens
when someone tries to escape.

37:30.109 --> 37:35.447
Here. Put on some makeup.
It should look like mine.

37:40.853 --> 37:43.990
Come on. Sit.

37:48.794 --> 37:50.495
Let me help you.

37:55.935 --> 37:59.171
I'm going to need you to stop crying,
otherwise your makeup will run.

38:04.110 --> 38:08.580
My favorite part of the day is coming
up before dinner. Might cheer you up.

38:09.248 --> 38:11.851
- What could possibly
be good here?

38:11.884 --> 38:13.853
Outside time.

38:13.886 --> 38:15.955
We get to go outside?

38:15.988 --> 38:17.555
You'll see.

38:37.677 --> 38:39.045
Beautiful.

38:47.219 --> 38:50.156
Hey. I'm next.

38:51.724 --> 38:53.626
Outside time is over.

38:59.165 --> 39:04.904
Hey. Look, I know it's hard here at
first, but act normal at dinner.

39:04.937 --> 39:08.174
And try to save some food for
the girl in the room next to you.

39:08.207 --> 39:09.842
That's all she gets to eat.

39:11.644 --> 39:15.247
Fix your hair.
Okay.

39:50.216 --> 39:51.917
Where are your manners,
Sadie?

39:58.924 --> 40:01.994
Control yourself,
or you'll be back in the hole.

40:06.699 --> 40:10.236
Hello. Do you want that?

40:11.070 --> 40:13.305
Oh, sorry. No.

40:15.041 --> 40:16.842
Okay.

40:16.876 --> 40:21.981
Is something wrong, Sadie?
It's okay. You can tell me.

40:23.816 --> 40:26.584
I miss my mom.

40:26.618 --> 40:28.220
What about your dad?

40:31.057 --> 40:34.894
You know the Army sent him home
early to help look for you.

40:34.927 --> 40:38.197
They think,
you might have run away.

40:41.767 --> 40:45.905
Yeah, you're finally getting
more attention than your sister.

40:45.938 --> 40:47.605
Isn't that what you've always
wanted?

40:49.241 --> 40:53.578
That's the last we'll talk about them.
This is your new family.

41:04.390 --> 41:06.759
There's no crying
at the table.

41:06.792 --> 41:10.229
If you want to eat,
I suggest you control yourself.

41:34.053 --> 41:35.688
What are you doing?

41:36.322 --> 41:38.991
Brad says when we become
perfect, we're allowed to leave.

41:39.024 --> 41:41.293
You're leaving?
Just like that?

41:41.327 --> 41:43.729
Not just like that.

41:43.762 --> 41:45.865
Been here
for almost three years.

41:46.866 --> 41:49.735
- This room is yours now.
- Oh, no. I... I can't stay here.

41:49.768 --> 41:51.237
Okay, please. I can't.

41:51.270 --> 41:53.672
Hey listen,
when you go to the police,

41:53.706 --> 41:55.908
tell them that my name
is Chelsea Wilson.

41:55.941 --> 41:57.776
He has sworn
if I go to the police...

41:57.810 --> 42:01.814
Let's go. Time for your
final performance, Sadie.

42:04.450 --> 42:06.051
Hang in there.

42:36.782 --> 42:39.718
Shh.

42:39.752 --> 42:45.090
Listen. I'm not who you think I am.
And my name is Chelsea.

42:45.124 --> 42:47.159
I'm new here.

42:47.193 --> 42:49.161
Now,
are you going to stay quiet?

43:20.326 --> 43:22.094
What's your name?

43:24.496 --> 43:26.131
Tina Morelli.

43:27.366 --> 43:30.769
I... I know that name.
Yeah, I saw your parents on TV.

43:30.803 --> 43:33.105
They're...
they're still looking for you.

43:43.048 --> 43:46.018
Why are we doing it
down there? It's so dirty.

43:50.522 --> 43:52.057
Brad?

44:04.536 --> 44:09.275
Arthur Bradley. Sadie needs your room
now, so that I can be closer to her.

44:09.308 --> 44:11.944
- But it's my room!
- Not anymore!

44:11.977 --> 44:15.147
Both of you can't stay in the same room.
It's not appropriate.

44:15.180 --> 44:17.950
You're my perfect little baby.

44:17.983 --> 44:20.252
I wish she was never born!

44:21.587 --> 44:25.124
- Ah!
- You just earned yourself a day in the shelter!

44:25.157 --> 44:28.894
I don't want
to go down there!

44:28.927 --> 44:32.197
Look what you just did!

44:42.308 --> 44:43.542
Brad?

44:53.452 --> 44:58.957
This video... it's going to be
something different.

44:58.991 --> 45:00.926
A piece of art.

45:01.560 --> 45:05.497
Something that has never been
done before.

45:06.565 --> 45:11.537
And if, when you finish,
you get to go home.

45:15.140 --> 45:16.875
Okay?

45:36.629 --> 45:40.499
Start off on the other side of the
room, with your back to me.

46:10.697 --> 46:12.464
You ready?

46:14.032 --> 46:15.401
Action.

46:15.434 --> 46:17.503
Ready! Okay!

46:20.472 --> 46:22.207
You're joking, right?

46:24.042 --> 46:25.477
Brad.

46:26.679 --> 46:28.414
Brad, say something!

46:30.650 --> 46:32.017
You're scaring me!

46:43.595 --> 46:45.698
You said I was perfect.

46:46.398 --> 46:52.304
You are. And that's why
your mother always hated me.

46:52.337 --> 46:54.973
Ever since the day
you were born.

46:55.007 --> 46:57.543
I'm not your sister Sadie!

47:06.285 --> 47:07.619
That's the spirit!

47:22.501 --> 47:24.169
Please!

47:29.374 --> 47:34.279
You've always tried to hurt me.

47:34.313 --> 47:36.014
Every.

47:37.249 --> 47:38.317
Chance.

47:40.052 --> 47:41.086
You got.

47:50.462 --> 47:56.301
I'm going to watch you die,
over and over again.

50:08.300 --> 50:09.669
Brad?

50:50.910 --> 50:53.780
Psst! Can you hear me?

50:54.981 --> 50:56.381
Hello?

50:56.983 --> 50:58.651
Behind the night stand.

51:04.924 --> 51:06.726
Down near the floor.

51:14.634 --> 51:16.468
Oh.

51:16.501 --> 51:18.805
So now you're taking care
of the girl in the next room?

51:18.838 --> 51:20.238
Yeah.

51:21.373 --> 51:22.975
She said you got her in trouble.
Why would you do that?

51:23.009 --> 51:27.013
Oh, don't believe her.

51:27.046 --> 51:31.951
The bitch tried to escape and got caught.
It's as simple as that.

51:33.452 --> 51:37.489
I think she tried to leave
because Brad chose me over her.

51:38.323 --> 51:41.694
Chose you? You make it sound
like it's a good thing.

51:44.831 --> 51:47.767
What happened to your face?

51:48.433 --> 51:51.336
He took me
in his room last night.

51:51.369 --> 51:53.673
He's a bit rough sometimes.

51:53.706 --> 51:57.375
- He rapes you?
- No. No, no, no.

51:57.409 --> 52:00.646
It's not like that. It's okay.

52:00.680 --> 52:04.650
- What do you mean it's okay?
- I love him.

52:06.719 --> 52:10.923
- Are you crazy?
- He understands me.

52:12.024 --> 52:16.629
He hasn't said it yet,
but I think he loves me, too.

52:16.662 --> 52:22.034
He's a psycho, okay?
He can't love anyone.

52:22.068 --> 52:25.972
Brad's nicer to me
than anyone in my own family.

52:26.005 --> 52:27.840
They all hated me.

52:29.441 --> 52:32.044
Brad helped me realize that.

52:32.078 --> 52:34.714
How long have you been here?

52:34.747 --> 52:37.449
A long time.

52:37.482 --> 52:40.485
So don't think you can come in
here and take him away from me.

53:04.644 --> 53:06.578
- Are you okay?
- Don't mother me.

53:26.498 --> 53:28.466
Nice, that you took it
all for yourself.

53:51.724 --> 53:55.862
Put it down.
Don't even touch that food.

53:58.030 --> 54:00.032
Stop it! Just stop it.

54:06.504 --> 54:07.673
Stop.

54:11.177 --> 54:13.646
No outside time
for either of you today.

54:15.447 --> 54:17.183
So he was nice to you?

54:17.216 --> 54:19.819
Only when he found
out I was pregnant.

54:19.852 --> 54:22.788
Oh, my God,
he got you pregnant?

54:22.822 --> 54:25.457
I didn't want his baby at first,

54:26.926 --> 54:29.095
but then I felt it moving
one day...

54:31.063 --> 54:34.166
...and I knew
I had to get out of this house.

54:36.135 --> 54:38.037
That's why I tried to escape.

54:39.872 --> 54:42.041
But he was right there.

54:44.010 --> 54:45.811
And he beat me.

54:49.649 --> 54:51.150
Please. No!

54:51.183 --> 54:52.718
And the baby?

54:52.752 --> 54:55.154
I lost her.

54:55.187 --> 54:58.190
At least I thought
it was a girl.

54:58.991 --> 55:01.459
You have to help me.

55:02.061 --> 55:03.629
How?

55:03.663 --> 55:05.631
Bring me enough painkillers
to end this.

55:05.665 --> 55:08.466
What? No, I won't do that.

55:08.500 --> 55:11.536
It's getting worse.
I'm not going to make it.

55:13.105 --> 55:15.007
Wait. Where are you going?

55:40.532 --> 55:41.634
It's no use.

55:45.705 --> 55:47.974
We need to get you
to a hospital.

55:48.007 --> 55:49.742
That's impossible.

55:50.776 --> 55:53.578
It's too late.
Please, just help me.

55:54.046 --> 55:56.048
No. I told you
I'm not gonna do that, okay?

55:56.082 --> 55:58.217
I'm in constant pain.

56:00.119 --> 56:02.520
I can't live like this anymore.

56:04.323 --> 56:07.592
It's my decision.

56:08.794 --> 56:10.062
Okay, fine.

56:11.964 --> 56:14.867
Then tell me everything you know
about how to get out of here.

56:40.259 --> 56:43.561
- I'll take care of that.
- You go clean the living room.

56:44.797 --> 56:45.965
Okay.

57:04.984 --> 57:07.253
Don't ever touch this picture!

57:17.696 --> 57:19.298
Chelsea!

57:26.772 --> 57:28.340
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

57:28.374 --> 57:30.709
Brad's mowing the lawn
right now.

57:30.743 --> 57:33.179
It'd be a good time
to get me those pills.

57:33.212 --> 57:36.715
They're in his right nightstand.

57:36.749 --> 57:38.317
In the top drawer.

57:39.051 --> 57:41.619
I'm... I'm locked in.
There's nothing I can do.

57:41.654 --> 57:44.723
I found a way to get out
of my room when it's locked.

57:44.757 --> 57:46.692
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

57:46.725 --> 57:49.728
I didn't want you
to rush out and get caught.

57:50.429 --> 57:51.997
But I'll tell you now.

57:53.132 --> 57:54.934
Just get me the pills.

57:56.469 --> 57:59.038
How do you know it's him and not a
neighbor? W... What if he walks back in?

57:59.071 --> 58:02.208
I know the sound
of Brad's lawnmower.

58:03.109 --> 58:06.212
What if he notices
the pills are missing?

58:06.245 --> 58:07.279
He won't.

58:08.714 --> 58:12.284
- Brad has tons of them.
- No, I don't know.

58:13.686 --> 58:15.087
Are you sure
you want to do this?

58:20.893 --> 58:23.028
It's not moving.

58:23.062 --> 58:27.366
You have to apply a lot of pressure,
and move it sharply sideways.

58:36.842 --> 58:38.744
I got it!

58:44.850 --> 58:46.452
Be careful.

58:46.485 --> 58:49.822
If you hear the lawnmower stop,
get back quick.

1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:17.062
No, no.

1:02:22.301 --> 1:02:23.936
Oh, shit!

1:03:49.421 --> 1:03:51.957
You are more trouble
than you're worth.

1:03:53.559 --> 1:03:55.527
At least now, no one else
will try to escape, will they?

1:04:02.669 --> 1:04:06.104
Shut up. Shut up!

1:04:07.573 --> 1:04:09.308
Let me help you.

1:04:11.510 --> 1:04:14.046
Get the hell out of here!
Now!

1:04:30.797 --> 1:04:34.166
Go back to your room,
or you're next.

1:04:34.199 --> 1:04:36.034
Brad, please don't.

1:04:36.068 --> 1:04:38.470
What did I just tell you?

1:04:45.410 --> 1:04:48.681
Please, just let him.

1:04:50.783 --> 1:04:52.384
Can I do it?

1:04:53.853 --> 1:04:57.222
What?
What are you trying to say, huh?

1:04:57.824 --> 1:04:59.491
Can I do it?

1:05:00.660 --> 1:05:02.361
Come on, lemme do it.

1:05:02.394 --> 1:05:06.733
But you're not
supposed to be in here.

1:05:06.766 --> 1:05:10.135
Please? Let me do it.

1:05:12.639 --> 1:05:16.441
Fine. It was boring anyway.

1:05:16.475 --> 1:05:18.210
This I have to see.

1:05:24.851 --> 1:05:26.786
At least it's not him.

1:06:13.733 --> 1:06:16.869
It's okay.
Just breathe in slowly.

1:06:20.205 --> 1:06:21.573
Wow!

1:06:27.579 --> 1:06:31.684
This... this is something
for us to remember.

1:06:33.385 --> 1:06:34.721
Forever.

1:06:42.227 --> 1:06:45.865
It's just the adrenaline rush,
okay? You'll get through it.

1:06:48.868 --> 1:06:53.271
Hey, hey. Come here. It's okay.
I want to show you something.

1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:57.275
Don't worry about that.
I'll clean that up later.

1:07:05.517 --> 1:07:08.520
Select the one
for stabbing Sadie.

1:07:17.396 --> 1:07:18.731
<i>Action!</i>

1:07:18.765 --> 1:07:20.733
<i>Ready! Okay!</i>

1:07:24.236 --> 1:07:25.537
<i>You're joking, right?</i>

1:07:32.344 --> 1:07:34.446
<i>I'm not your sister Sadie!</i>

1:07:45.590 --> 1:07:47.292
What did you think?

1:07:50.462 --> 1:07:53.265
Did it... did it bother you?

1:07:54.667 --> 1:07:58.403
It's such a rush.
It took my breath away!

1:08:00.940 --> 1:08:02.607
My turn.

1:08:09.481 --> 1:08:11.550
<i>Ready! Okay!</i>

1:08:13.552 --> 1:08:14.721
<i>You're joking, right?</i>

1:08:17.322 --> 1:08:19.624
Um, how does this work?
Can I try it?

1:08:20.693 --> 1:08:24.429
Not right now.
I want to make another one.

1:08:24.463 --> 1:08:28.600
- Another video of what?
- Your sister, Sadie.

1:08:28.634 --> 1:08:31.838
She's just been bugging the shit
out of me ever since you got here.

1:08:33.673 --> 1:08:34.907
You and me both.

1:08:37.710 --> 1:08:39.746
How do you think
we should kill her?

1:08:43.049 --> 1:08:46.786
Oh, uh... I don't know.

1:08:48.688 --> 1:08:50.857
I want to do something
different.

1:08:50.890 --> 1:08:53.826
Maybe something medieval,
like...

1:08:53.860 --> 1:08:56.394
crushing her skull
with a sledgehammer

1:08:56.428 --> 1:08:58.563
or just taking off her
head with a sword.

1:09:01.566 --> 1:09:03.069
You know, I think
with muscles like yours,

1:09:03.102 --> 1:09:05.504
you should just
beat the shit out of her.

1:09:06.672 --> 1:09:11.376
Just punch her,
over and over.

1:09:12.611 --> 1:09:14.847
That way we have
a long video to watch.

1:09:15.748 --> 1:09:19.886
That's brutal. I like it.

1:09:22.922 --> 1:09:24.957
- Wait, now?
- Right now.

1:09:24.991 --> 1:09:28.426
Shouldn't we talk it over?
You know, plan it out?

1:09:28.460 --> 1:09:31.363
No. Mm-mm.
I can always get more girls.

1:09:40.907 --> 1:09:43.910
You know, I was thinking we could
do something else right now.

1:09:47.512 --> 1:09:48.815
Like what?

1:09:58.157 --> 1:10:02.494
I never knew someone
like you could exist.

1:10:03.461 --> 1:10:05.765
You know,
I can say the same about you.

1:10:09.769 --> 1:10:10.837
You're perfect.

1:10:21.914 --> 1:10:25.318
No one's ever
said that to me before.

1:10:41.499 --> 1:10:42.935
Come with me.

1:11:28.014 --> 1:11:29.115
Good night.

Uh, Brad, would you like
the last pancake?

1:16:38.390 --> 1:16:41.894
No. Thank you, Sadie.
I am very satisfied.

1:16:46.532 --> 1:16:50.069
I need to do a test with
the new virtual reality camera

1:16:50.102 --> 1:16:53.239
and I need one of you
lucky girls to help me.

1:16:54.273 --> 1:16:58.177
Can it be me?
I've been practicing every day.

1:16:59.445 --> 1:17:01.847
Since you asked first.

1:17:30.075 --> 1:17:32.278
- Watch it!
- That's enough.

1:17:34.346 --> 1:17:37.182
You see what I've been saying?
Take your sister to her room.

1:17:41.353 --> 1:17:44.123
- Calm down.
- You took the only thing I cared about.

1:17:44.156 --> 1:17:46.992
Meagan, you need to listen to me.
You're in danger.

1:17:47.026 --> 1:17:51.363
- He's planning to kill you. Today.
- Oh, yeah, right. Sure he is.

1:17:51.397 --> 1:17:53.032
You need to see this.

1:17:59.338 --> 1:18:01.340
I saw Brad do it.

1:18:01.373 --> 1:18:04.310
He was forcing the pillow
on her face.

1:18:04.343 --> 1:18:06.312
I don't believe you.

1:18:06.345 --> 1:18:07.579
He's a murderer.

1:18:07.613 --> 1:18:09.848
Brad is not like that.

1:18:10.316 --> 1:18:13.185
She probably died on her own.

1:18:13.218 --> 1:18:15.020
No,
he also killed Heather!

1:18:15.054 --> 1:18:18.557
He let Heather go.
You're making all this up.

1:18:18.590 --> 1:18:21.026
I swear I'm not.

1:18:22.394 --> 1:18:24.463
He made a video
with that camera thing, okay,

1:18:24.496 --> 1:18:28.067
and I saw him stabbing Heather
through those goggles.

1:18:28.100 --> 1:18:30.235
You're just trying
to turn me against him.

1:18:32.471 --> 1:18:34.273
It was real.

1:18:34.306 --> 1:18:36.842
- Show me.
- I can't.

1:18:37.677 --> 1:18:39.311
It's too risky.

1:18:42.281 --> 1:18:44.049
Then you're a fucking liar.

1:18:54.493 --> 1:18:56.395
Hey! Wait!

1:18:59.298 --> 1:19:01.433
- What are you doing?
- Get off of me!

1:19:02.334 --> 1:19:05.137
What the hell is going on?

1:19:05.170 --> 1:19:09.375
- Brad, this bitch is telling all kinds of lies about you.
- She's crazy.

1:19:09.408 --> 1:19:12.311
Sadie, I have had enough of your bullshit.
Get out of my sight.

1:19:12.344 --> 1:19:14.480
She said you killed
two of our sisters.

1:19:15.547 --> 1:19:18.450
- You did what?
- She's lying, okay. Don't believe her.

1:19:18.484 --> 1:19:22.287
She said she saw you stab
our sister in the VR goggles.

1:19:24.189 --> 1:19:26.058
That's ridiculous!

1:19:28.026 --> 1:19:29.395
See?

1:19:30.697 --> 1:19:33.065
Why would you say that, Sadie?

1:19:33.599 --> 1:19:35.702
I... I don't...

1:19:35.735 --> 1:19:41.039
Shut up! I can't trust you.
I can't trust any of you.

1:19:42.975 --> 1:19:44.910
Get upstairs. Now!

1:19:47.246 --> 1:19:49.114
Come on.

1:19:57.322 --> 1:19:59.358
And you, get in there!

1:20:12.104 --> 1:20:14.373
- Meagan!
- Leave me alone!

1:20:14.406 --> 1:20:16.175
Meagan, you need
to listen to me, okay?

1:20:16.208 --> 1:20:18.977
We have to work together.
It's our only chance.

1:20:19.011 --> 1:20:22.981
No, we don't.
You're the one that's in trouble.

1:20:23.015 --> 1:20:25.984
Meagan,
he's going to kill both of us.

1:20:26.018 --> 1:20:27.754
He wouldn't do that.

1:20:27.787 --> 1:20:30.222
You saw
what he did to Tina.

1:20:30.255 --> 1:20:34.359
And he killed Heather. I...
I swear I'm telling you the truth.

1:20:34.393 --> 1:20:36.328
Then prove it!

1:21:56.208 --> 1:21:59.779
What are you doing?
How did you get out?

1:21:59.812 --> 1:22:03.415
Tina's bedroom door is unlocked.
Come on, the proof is in Brad's office.

1:22:03.850 --> 1:22:07.085
I'm not going out there.

1:22:07.119 --> 1:22:09.689
Brad is down in the hole
preparing to kill you, Meagan.

1:22:09.722 --> 1:22:11.189
Wake up.

1:22:13.191 --> 1:22:15.294
Uh, here. Put this on.

1:22:15.327 --> 1:22:17.162
- Okay.
- Sit down.

1:22:17.563 --> 1:22:20.299
<i>You said I was perfect.</i>

1:22:20.332 --> 1:22:22.234
<i>No!</i>

1:22:29.575 --> 1:22:30.810
<i>That's the spirit!</i>

1:22:33.612 --> 1:22:37.115
<i>No! No!</i>

1:22:45.758 --> 1:22:47.492
<i>Please!</i>

1:22:54.734 --> 1:22:57.169
You better stay
right fucking there!

1:23:40.980 --> 1:23:44.416
Where...
where are we going? No! No! No.

1:24:01.533 --> 1:24:02.802
Get up!

1:24:04.336 --> 1:24:07.840
Meagan! Help me!

1:24:10.509 --> 1:24:13.680
Meagan! Please help me!

1:24:18.818 --> 1:24:22.187
Get down there, or I will
throw you down there head first.

1:24:48.681 --> 1:24:50.983
Everything you said to me...

1:24:53.720 --> 1:24:55.353
killing Tina...

1:24:56.388 --> 1:24:58.490
was all an act, wasn't it?

1:24:58.523 --> 1:25:02.327
I meant everything I said,
Brad. I promise.

1:25:02.360 --> 1:25:05.765
Then why the fuck did you
show her the VR stabbing?

1:25:07.299 --> 1:25:08.668
Because...

1:25:10.502 --> 1:25:14.674
because I... I thought
she could maybe help us.

1:25:15.808 --> 1:25:17.844
She likes you, too, Brad.

1:25:18.945 --> 1:25:20.880
You expect me to believe that?

1:25:25.985 --> 1:25:27.619
Get up.

1:25:29.621 --> 1:25:34.426
I'll do anything you want, Brad.
Please. Please.

1:25:37.362 --> 1:25:41.634
I don't want anything
from you anymore, Sadie.

1:25:55.748 --> 1:25:57.650
Then what did you want?

1:26:12.531 --> 1:26:15.567
No, no, no! No!

1:26:25.111 --> 1:26:27.379
Why did you do this?

1:26:28.781 --> 1:26:31.349
I did it
so we could be together.

1:26:31.784 --> 1:26:33.418
What are you saying, Brad?

1:26:41.127 --> 1:26:43.461
Put it down. Put it down!

1:26:43.495 --> 1:26:45.497
I'd rather die than be with you.

1:26:56.042 --> 1:26:57.475
No. No. no. No, no, no!

1:27:04.951 --> 1:27:06.752
No! No!

1:27:09.121 --> 1:27:11.356
No!

1:27:19.564 --> 1:27:21.868
No! No!

1:28:00.538 --> 1:28:02.108
Please.

1:28:16.822 --> 1:28:18.456
Please.

1:28:22.929 --> 1:28:26.598
I hope you like this.
It was your idea.

1:28:48.087 --> 1:28:50.122
You make another move like
that, I'll break your neck.

1:28:50.156 --> 1:28:51.824
Get off me!

1:28:52.792 --> 1:28:55.628
How about one more go
at it for old times' sake.

1:29:17.883 --> 1:29:19.051
Meagan, get over here!

1:29:23.289 --> 1:29:26.125
Put down the knife,
or I'll kill her right now.

1:29:26.158 --> 1:29:27.293
Don't listen to him.

1:29:27.326 --> 1:29:29.527
- Do it.
- Okay. Okay.

1:29:30.796 --> 1:29:32.732
Now back up.

1:29:42.308 --> 1:29:43.676
Push him!

1:30:30.622 --> 1:30:31.791
Get his keys!

1:30:35.127 --> 1:30:36.896
I got them!

1:30:36.929 --> 1:30:38.596
-Let's go!

1:30:54.246 --> 1:30:55.948
Forget it! Okay! Let's go!

1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:03.089
Okay. Shit!

1:31:11.230 --> 1:31:12.631
Let's go!

1:31:58.077 --> 1:31:59.278
Get the door!

1:32:21.267 --> 1:32:22.234
I got it!

1:32:28.741 --> 1:32:31.710
- Help!
- Help! Help!

1:32:33.112 --> 1:32:35.414
- Cell phone!
- Please help us!

1:32:35.447 --> 1:32:37.950
Whoa! Slow down!
Wait, what happened to you?

1:32:39.084 --> 1:32:40.953
Call 911.

1:32:40.986 --> 1:32:43.355
- Is there anyone else
in there?

1:32:43.389 --> 1:32:46.091
I don't, I don't... know.

1:32:50.062 --> 1:32:52.998
Mom! Mom! Mom, it's me!

1:32:53.032 --> 1:32:55.868
<i>Chelsea? Chelsea!
Oh, my God, you're alive!</i>

1:32:55.901 --> 1:32:58.938
<i>Mike! Mike! Mike! Kristina!
Come here, it's Chelsea!</i>

1:32:58.971 --> 1:33:00.372
<i>It's Chelsea!</i>

1:33:00.406 --> 1:33:03.075
<i>Oh, my God.
What happened to you?</i>

1:33:04.476 --> 1:33:07.980
<i>Baby. Are you all right?</i>

1:33:08.013 --> 1:33:11.417
Yeah, I'm okay, Dad.

1:33:11.450 --> 1:33:12.751
<i>Where are you?</i>

1:33:12.785 --> 1:33:14.253
I don't really know.

1:33:20.125 --> 1:33:21.427
You don't know?

1:33:24.263 --> 1:33:27.900
Because my parents made me.
That's why.

1:33:28.534 --> 1:33:29.902
Yes.

1:33:30.502 --> 1:33:36.108
But, specifically,
why are you here?

1:33:36.942 --> 1:33:41.780
So that a complete stranger
can pry into my life?

1:33:44.250 --> 1:33:50.289
Chelsea, don't you think that what you've
been through deserves some discussion?

1:33:50.322 --> 1:33:54.326
You want me to tell you
every detail of what happened?

1:33:57.396 --> 1:33:59.298
Whatever comes to mind.

1:34:03.235 --> 1:34:06.505
I don't want to relive
what happened again and again.

1:34:08.574 --> 1:34:12.278
I'm sure Brad is doing that every
day, in whatever jail he's in.

1:34:14.947 --> 1:34:16.448
That's what he liked to do.

1:34:17.583 --> 1:34:22.121
You know, relive it
all over again, and again.

1:34:23.489 --> 1:34:26.825
Chelsea, you will eventually
get through this.

1:34:28.994 --> 1:34:35.034
And you can rest assured
that Arthur, A.K.A. Brad...

1:34:35.901 --> 1:34:40.873
is not dealing well
with his new situation.

1:35:12.905 --> 1:35:16.342
No, no! Somebody... Somebody
help me! Somebody help me!

1:35:32.124 --> 1:35:35.894
No!

1:35:43.001 --> 1:35:45.871
Okay, um, what about him?

1:35:48.641 --> 1:35:51.210
Ugh, no. I got one.

1:35:52.712 --> 1:35:56.448
All right, he is cute.
How old is he?

1:35:56.482 --> 1:36:01.186
Seventeen. And it says he's
close by and has a car, look.

1:36:01.220 --> 1:36:05.357
Yeah, but, he's not gonna pick
up a couple of 13-year-old girls.

1:36:11.063 --> 1:36:12.665
Now we're 16.

1:36:13.999 --> 1:36:16.969
Oh, my God,
you didn't, did you?

1:36:17.002 --> 1:36:19.972
Yeah. And I just liked
his profile pic.
