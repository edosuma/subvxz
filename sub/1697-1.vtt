-Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

00:39.090 --> 00:41.480
No. No.

00:41.530 --> 00:46.650
Come on, Mile. Just jump out of bed
and say, ''Yeah, yeah, yeah!''

00:48.130 --> 00:49.400
What are you doing?

00:49.450 --> 00:51.480
Looking for the snooze button.

00:51.530 --> 00:56.000
Oh, no. You don't want to be late
for your first day of high school.

00:58.810 --> 01:01.450
Don't make me get the water bucket.

01:02.810 --> 01:04.370
You wouldn't.

01:04.930 --> 01:06.570
Yes, he would.

Junior boys.

01:24.090 --> 01:25.960
Senior boys.

01:26.810 --> 01:29.880
Can you believe it?
Yesterday, we were girls.

01:29.930 --> 01:33.640
Today, we're high-school girls.

01:37.010 --> 01:41.160
-Breath. Pits. Boogies. Zits.
-Breath. Pits. Boogies. Zits.

01:41.210 --> 01:43.200
-You're good.
-You're...

01:43.450 --> 01:46.010
Let's move that little hat down.

01:48.490 --> 01:49.640
Hey, bro.

01:49.690 --> 01:52.800
Junior. Freshman. No bro. Got to go.

01:54.170 --> 01:56.200
Miley, l can't walk around
like this all day,

01:56.250 --> 01:59.050
l look like a sock puppet.

01:59.090 --> 02:01.400
Do you have any cover-up?

02:06.490 --> 02:08.240
You brought Barry Bear?

02:08.289 --> 02:10.320
Put him back!
l don't want anybody to see him.

02:10.370 --> 02:11.720
Then why'd you bring him?

02:11.770 --> 02:15.280
Because it's a big day.
l'm nervous and...

02:16.610 --> 02:18.840
He wanted to see the school.

02:18.890 --> 02:22.280
Yeah. Okay. Well, he's seen it now.
Would you zip him back up, please?

02:22.330 --> 02:26.080
Fine, but not all the way.
He's afraid of the dark.

02:27.410 --> 02:29.400
Do you realise what would happen
to your rep

02:29.450 --> 02:31.200
if people saw you with that bear?

02:31.250 --> 02:34.960
l can't imagine a more horrible first day
of high school.

02:36.610 --> 02:39.120
l can. Look at this text.

02:39.690 --> 02:41.480
''l know your secret.''

02:41.530 --> 02:44.170
Somebody knows
l'm Hannah Montana!

02:51.410 --> 02:53.000

02:53.050 --> 02:57.040

<i>And you know tha</i> t
<i>it's the best of both world</i> s

03:39.570 --> 03:42.400
What am l gonna do?
l've tried so hard to keep the secret.

03:42.450 --> 03:45.280
-This is going to ruin everything.
-You don't know that.

03:45.330 --> 03:46.890
So one other person knows,

03:46.930 --> 03:49.360
it doesn't mean
they're going to tell everyone at lunch.

03:49.410 --> 03:51.400
Oh, no. l'm getting another text!

03:51.450 --> 03:55.080
-What's it say?
-''l'm going to tell everybody at lunch.''

03:55.530 --> 03:59.810
Wow, creepy.
What's ''Mwah-ah-ah-ah''?

04:00.210 --> 04:04.120
l think it's more like...

04:05.770 --> 04:10.440
ln two hours, any chance l have of
being a normal high school girl is over.

04:10.490 --> 04:11.920
Yeah, tell me about it.

04:11.970 --> 04:15.640
lf people find out
you're Annah-hay Ontana-may,

04:15.690 --> 04:17.360
you won't be able to go to any school.

04:17.410 --> 04:18.920
Except maybe in the South Pole,

04:18.970 --> 04:21.610
completely cut off from civilisation,
where you'll eventually go mad.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.640
Mad, l tell you. Mad!

04:24.570 --> 04:26.640
You put extra sugar in your cereal
this morning, didn't you?

04:26.690 --> 04:29.280
Yes, and now the room is spinning.

04:31.530 --> 04:33.280
-Hello.
-Hey.

04:37.490 --> 04:38.810
Hello.

04:39.450 --> 04:41.090
Hey, again.

04:49.610 --> 04:52.250
Whoa, this is a hoot.
What are we doing, eh?

04:52.290 --> 04:53.320
Who are you?

04:53.370 --> 04:55.880
l'm Thor.
The new guy, don't you know?

04:55.930 --> 04:58.570
Okay, well,
we'll see you at the 25th reunion.

04:59.010 --> 05:03.240
Where you going? Those guys said
you were the welcoming committee.

05:04.090 --> 05:07.640
l get it. See, those are my friends.
They're just messing with you.

05:07.690 --> 05:09.480
Real funny, guys.

05:10.530 --> 05:15.120
Yeah, real mature, make fun of
the new guy and the short one.

05:15.170 --> 05:16.570
Hey!

05:17.530 --> 05:20.880
Don't you worry,
we don't need those hockey pucks.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.360
You know, you're right.
Hey, l'll race you to the fourth floor.

05:25.410 --> 05:26.730
Okay!

05:30.370 --> 05:32.840
Hey, man, we don't have a fourth floor.

05:32.930 --> 05:33.960
Oops.

05:36.650 --> 05:39.320
l have got to figure out who this is.

05:39.370 --> 05:42.480
l didn't tell anyone,
you didn't tell anyone.

05:43.050 --> 05:45.040
-You didn't tell anyone, did you?
-Of course not!

05:45.090 --> 05:47.650
Well, who else could it be?

05:47.690 --> 05:50.650
Hey. What up?

05:51.370 --> 05:54.520
How's it going? Hey.
Watch out there. Okay.

05:54.570 --> 05:55.640
-What did you do?
-Nothing.

05:55.690 --> 05:58.330
l've just been working out
on the old bicep, tricep...

05:58.370 --> 05:59.930
Oliver!

05:59.970 --> 06:01.480
Forget the muscles, meatball.

06:01.530 --> 06:03.520
You told someone my secret,
didn't you? Didn't you?

06:03.570 --> 06:06.160
No, l swear! And easy on the pecs.

06:06.970 --> 06:08.530
They pop.

06:09.690 --> 06:11.520
Oh, no, incoming.

06:12.170 --> 06:16.080
''Wondering what you can do
to stop me? l have an idea.''

06:16.690 --> 06:19.520
-Who is this?
-l don't know!

06:19.570 --> 06:23.450
l got it! All we have to do
is look for the person texting.

06:25.570 --> 06:28.130
That narrows it down to everybody.

06:30.250 --> 06:33.560
l love chemistry. lt's educational

06:33.610 --> 06:34.640
and delicious.

06:35.010 --> 06:37.970
Can l get you some chocolate
and graham crackers to go with that?

06:38.010 --> 06:39.330
Yeah, that'd be...

06:39.370 --> 06:44.570
Totally inappropriate
because l shouldn't even be doing this.

06:44.610 --> 06:47.200
Okay, people, let's stop fooling around.

06:47.250 --> 06:50.440
-Now, lose the marshmallow, Stewart!
-Yes, ma'am.

06:54.410 --> 06:56.200
Hot, hot, hot.

06:57.570 --> 06:59.320
Really hot.

06:59.370 --> 07:02.250
-Hi, is this seat taken?
-No, go for it.

07:08.650 --> 07:11.160
-l'm Jackson.
-Hi, l'm Anne.

07:11.210 --> 07:14.560
And l'm Thor, his new best buddy,

07:14.610 --> 07:16.560
and l was kind of hoping
l could sit there.

07:16.610 --> 07:17.880
No!

07:18.850 --> 07:21.810
-Go.
-l get it. You like her.

07:22.490 --> 07:24.240
He likes you.

07:24.290 --> 07:28.360
Look at his face, it's redder
than a cow's udder on a cold day.

07:29.170 --> 07:30.960
Of course,
they're pretty much always red,

07:31.010 --> 07:34.080
what with all the yanking,
don't you know?

07:35.090 --> 07:39.640
Maybe you two should sit together,
and l'll sit any place else.

07:40.930 --> 07:44.000
But l have marshmallows.

07:44.610 --> 07:47.120
You know, since she doesn't seem
to be interested in you,

07:47.170 --> 07:50.400
you mind if l take a shot?

07:59.770 --> 08:02.800
l bet they want something
like money or concert tickets.

08:02.850 --> 08:06.080
lf it was me, l'd take your jewellery
and your wardrobe.

08:06.130 --> 08:08.800
And your shoes! Oh, yeah, your shoes!

08:09.650 --> 08:11.920
Turn around,
l'll give you one of my shoes right now.

08:11.970 --> 08:15.360
Sorry, l'm just trying
to get into the mind of a criminal.

08:15.410 --> 08:18.640
lf you can understand them,
you can catch them.

08:19.090 --> 08:21.840
And then what, Sherlock?

08:22.210 --> 08:26.170
As long as they know my secret,
l'll have to do whatever they want.

08:26.210 --> 08:28.600
What kind of monster
would torture me like this?

08:28.650 --> 08:33.679
Morning, let's welcome
a special young man to our class.

08:33.730 --> 08:37.440
He skipped a couple of grades,
so he's a little younger.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.880
And a lot smarter.

08:40.929 --> 08:42.520
This is Rico.

08:43.570 --> 08:45.920
Hiya, toots, get my messages?

08:54.770 --> 08:58.520
Don't worry, Mrs Espinosa.
We'll take good care of the new kid.

08:58.570 --> 08:59.760
Okay.

09:00.610 --> 09:02.880
All right, short stack,
how'd you find out?

09:02.930 --> 09:05.760
Simple. You were careless,
and l had a camera phone.

09:08.410 --> 09:11.480
Give me that phone
or you'll never make it to four feet!

09:11.530 --> 09:16.120
Feel free to pat me down, kitten,
but it's safe in my locker.

09:16.890 --> 09:21.320
Step aside, squirt,
and let the locker doctor operate.

09:26.490 --> 09:27.920
Oh, yeah.

09:30.530 --> 09:33.090
Wow, that's a really big jersey
for such a little...

09:33.130 --> 09:36.010
l didn't say that was my locker.

09:36.050 --> 09:40.040
Hey, fresh-meat, what're you doing
crammed inside my locker?

09:40.690 --> 09:43.920
l'm not crammed inside...
My mom's a cop!

09:45.770 --> 09:49.520
Okay. Rico, you know my secret.
What's it gonna take to shut you up?

09:49.570 --> 09:51.680
You. As my girlfriend.

09:52.210 --> 09:53.640
Say what?

09:54.410 --> 09:58.560
Don't flatter yourself, doll-face.
This is strictly business.

09:59.010 --> 10:03.210
l need some hall cred in this place,
and you can help me get it.

10:03.250 --> 10:05.810
So all he's looking for
is a little arm candy.

10:05.850 --> 10:09.640
That, and someone
to reach the top shelf of my locker.

10:10.890 --> 10:14.480
-You can totally do that.
-You can totally shut up.

10:14.970 --> 10:18.680
Of course, if you'd rather l send
the picture to everyone at school...

10:18.730 --> 10:22.480
Miley, you have to do what he says.
lt's either that or your secret's out.

10:22.530 --> 10:24.840
So far, high school stinks.

10:26.570 --> 10:30.360
Yeah, l remember
how l met my woman.

10:31.530 --> 10:35.760
l had just come out of the ocean.
My skin was shining like...

10:36.250 --> 10:37.730
Like...

10:37.770 --> 10:41.650
What was it shining like, love monkey?

10:41.690 --> 10:44.600
A new penny
in the piggy bank of my heart.

10:45.850 --> 10:48.440
What can l say? She's crazy in love.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.850
Cheese me.

10:57.570 --> 10:58.840
Enough!

10:59.490 --> 11:02.640
Sorry, l just got so lost in your eyes.

11:03.650 --> 11:05.840
Your beady little eyes.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.570
Secrets.

11:08.450 --> 11:11.360
Right. Please forgive me.

11:12.450 --> 11:14.920
Now, go get daddy a moist towelette

11:14.970 --> 11:18.120
and make it hot like my Latin blood.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.600
Of course, my little matador.

11:24.930 --> 11:28.840
''You know, Bud,
you can always be home-schooled.''

11:28.890 --> 11:31.640
''No, Daddy, l want to go to school
like a normal kid.''

11:31.690 --> 11:33.600
What was l thinking?

11:34.450 --> 11:36.400
There you are! l've got great news!

11:36.450 --> 11:39.840
Unless it involves a time machine
and Rico's parents never meeting,

11:39.890 --> 11:41.120
l don't want to know.

11:41.170 --> 11:43.760
Fine, then l won't tell you
that Oliver found Rico's locker.

11:43.810 --> 11:45.290
Great! That means
we have to go find Rico's...

11:45.330 --> 11:47.480
And l'm gonna stop talking now
and follow you.

11:47.530 --> 11:49.320
That would be nice.

11:53.650 --> 11:57.770
<i>My kids are all gon</i> e

11:58.650 --> 12:02.880
<i>So l'm writing this son</i> g

12:04.010 --> 12:08.480
<i>You'll think it's so sa</i> d

12:08.850 --> 12:13.720
<i>But you are so wron</i> g

12:13.770 --> 12:17.730
<i>'cause l can pick my nos</i> e

12:17.770 --> 12:21.440

12:21.490 --> 12:23.800
<i>Oh, yea</i> h

12:25.410 --> 12:28.130
l am never coming home
for lunch again.

12:29.170 --> 12:32.160
Good, 'cause this is
my Robby Ray time.

12:32.210 --> 12:35.600
Look, l didn't plan on coming home.
l just couldn't take it any more.

12:35.650 --> 12:37.560
-Take what?
-Okay.

12:37.610 --> 12:41.240
Some hick from Moo-ville, Minnesota

12:41.290 --> 12:44.800
decided that l'm his new best buddy,
and now he won't leave me alone.

12:44.850 --> 12:47.080
lf l have to hear
that stupid accent one more time,

12:47.130 --> 12:51.600
l'm gonna beat myself unconscious
with a frozen trout, don't you know?

12:53.250 --> 12:57.800
l seem to remember another new kid
that talked funny a few years ago.

12:57.850 --> 13:00.120
They called him a hick, too.

13:00.570 --> 13:05.360
Let's see. What was his name?
Packson? Sackson?

13:13.370 --> 13:15.520
Howdy, everybody. l'm Jackson.

13:16.370 --> 13:19.200
l didn't know there was a rodeo in town.

13:19.490 --> 13:22.680
There's a rodeo in town? Yee, doggies!

13:23.090 --> 13:25.680
He was talking about your getup.

13:25.730 --> 13:28.880
You like it? Well, then check this out.

13:31.650 --> 13:35.560
Back home in Tennessee,
that's what we call blang!

13:35.610 --> 13:36.640
lt's bling.

13:36.690 --> 13:38.920
That's what l said. Blang!

13:38.970 --> 13:40.640
What a loser.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.680
Ride 'em, cowboy!

13:46.970 --> 13:49.360
Crackson, Shellackson.

13:49.730 --> 13:52.760
Enough, Dad!
l already had the flashback.

13:54.090 --> 13:57.160
What l'm saying, Son, if you think
about what happened to you,

13:57.210 --> 13:59.080
you might wanna
cut this boy some slack.

13:59.130 --> 14:02.640
But why is this my problem?
l mean, nobody ever cut me a break.

14:02.690 --> 14:04.880
lf l had to tough it out, then so can he.

14:04.930 --> 14:06.680
And that's exactly
what l'm gonna tell him.

14:06.730 --> 14:08.320
l know, but l was just thinking
if you would just...

14:08.370 --> 14:09.960
Good day.

14:10.290 --> 14:12.880
-Son, l...
-l said good day, Daddy!

14:16.050 --> 14:19.840
<i>Now Jackson is gon</i> e

14:20.610 --> 14:24.080
<i>And l am so happ</i> y

14:24.810 --> 14:29.010
<i>l think l'll just head upstair</i> s

14:29.610 --> 14:34.400
<i>And take me a napp</i> y

14:35.050 --> 14:36.920
Good night, Malibu!

14:44.450 --> 14:48.680
-Oliver, how'd you find it?
-Cunning, determination and...

14:48.730 --> 14:52.000
And it was the only locker
with a footstool in front of it.

14:52.050 --> 14:53.720
Would it have killed you
to let me have this one?

14:53.770 --> 14:57.760
Guys, please! Some time before
Rico and l honeymoon in Hobbit Town!

14:57.810 --> 15:01.960
Okay. Step aside, ladies.
The doctor is in.

15:07.530 --> 15:10.640
Look at all the plants
and that waterfall.

15:10.690 --> 15:13.920
-lt's like a rainforest in there.
-Who cares? Can you see the phone?

15:13.970 --> 15:16.640
Yeah. lt's right next to that monkey!

15:24.770 --> 15:27.520
-Hey, Max, have you seen Thor?
-Yeah, he's in there.

15:27.570 --> 15:32.080
l told him California girls love guys
who can churn their own butter.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.160
Hey, butta-butta-butta.
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

15:36.210 --> 15:37.610
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

15:37.650 --> 15:38.720
-Churn!
-Churn!

15:38.770 --> 15:41.280
Hey, butta-butta-butta.
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

15:41.330 --> 15:42.600
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

15:42.650 --> 15:43.720
-Churn!
-Churn!

15:43.770 --> 15:45.250
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

15:45.290 --> 15:47.200
-Oh, man.
-l know.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.160
This kid's dorkier than that
light-up cowboy from freshman year.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.640
Remember?

15:51.690 --> 15:53.720
Wait. That was you.

15:56.210 --> 15:57.480
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

15:57.530 --> 15:58.560
-Churn!
-Churn!

15:58.610 --> 15:59.840
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

15:59.890 --> 16:02.530
Hey, hey, hey, show's over.
Knock it off!

16:02.570 --> 16:04.880
l can't, little buddy. l'm in the zone.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.200
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

16:06.250 --> 16:09.920
No, no, no. Not you!
You! And you and you! All you guys.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.690
Just cut the dude a break!

16:11.730 --> 16:13.240
lt doesn't make you cool
to make fun of somebody.

16:13.290 --> 16:15.680
lt just makes you all jerks.

16:15.730 --> 16:17.400
All Thor wants to do
is make some friends.

16:17.450 --> 16:19.090
And butter.

16:19.130 --> 16:21.080
You're not helping.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.520
Now if you hockey pucks
will excuse us,

16:23.570 --> 16:25.800
me and my new best buddy
have some butter to churn.

16:25.850 --> 16:28.410
Okey-dokey, artichoke-y.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.600
Hey, butta-butta-butta.
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

16:31.650 --> 16:32.760
Hey, butta-butta-butta.

16:32.810 --> 16:34.400
-Churn!
-Whoa, slow down there, buddy!

16:34.450 --> 16:36.880
You don't want to hit the air

16:38.250 --> 16:39.650
bubble.

16:40.370 --> 16:42.200
Sweet niblets.

16:42.770 --> 16:46.000
l've got butter
in all my nooks and crannies.

16:47.890 --> 16:52.090
Okay, l'll stall Rico.
Oliver, make friends with the monkey.

16:52.130 --> 16:53.880
And exactly how do l do that?

16:53.930 --> 16:57.240
Just be yourself.
He'll think you're family.

16:57.290 --> 16:59.010
High school's made you hard.

16:59.050 --> 17:02.010
-Coconut!
-What kind of comeback is...

17:06.089 --> 17:07.520
-Rico!
-Hi.

17:08.450 --> 17:10.800
Honey, where are you going?

17:10.849 --> 17:14.200
l've got to grab some books
out of my locker.

17:15.250 --> 17:18.640
But save the ''honey'' thing for later.
Daddy likey.

17:20.530 --> 17:21.960
You can't leave me!

17:22.010 --> 17:25.400
You can cut the act, string bean.
Nobody's watching.

17:25.450 --> 17:27.089
lt's not an act.

17:28.010 --> 17:31.120
Look, Rico.
l know l said l couldn't stand you,

17:31.170 --> 17:35.520
but the truth is,
deep down, way, way deep down,

17:37.050 --> 17:41.040
l've always thought you were a...

17:41.850 --> 17:43.120
A hunk.

17:44.530 --> 17:45.960
Really?

17:47.770 --> 17:50.520
May l be hit by lightning if l'm lying.

17:54.370 --> 17:58.280
Who wants to trade a silly little phone
for a nice banana?

17:58.330 --> 18:00.440
Why would he want a stupid banana?

18:00.490 --> 18:04.400
Yeah, he's got a snow-cone machine
and a mini-fridge...

18:09.650 --> 18:11.880
This feels so right,

18:11.930 --> 18:14.490
and yet something haunts me.

18:15.090 --> 18:17.440
How can l be sure your love is true?

18:17.490 --> 18:20.290
You're on my lap, aren't you?

18:20.330 --> 18:23.360
Perhaps you could prove your love
with a kiss.

18:24.290 --> 18:25.720
Okay.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.520
Who do you want me to kiss?

18:29.450 --> 18:31.440
Okay, fine. l'll do it.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.240
Let me just ready myself.

18:36.290 --> 18:39.760
You know, this may...
This will take some time.

18:46.210 --> 18:50.000
Get your stinking paws off me,
you darn dirty ape!

18:52.370 --> 18:55.360
-Use your muscles!
-They're in my book bag!

19:01.850 --> 19:05.240
Hello! My lips are chapping.
Let's get smacking!

19:11.610 --> 19:13.560
-We got it!
-We got the phone!

19:13.610 --> 19:15.760
Kiss the chicken, bub!

19:18.570 --> 19:21.530
Your little blackmail scheme is over!

19:25.530 --> 19:27.120
l think not.

19:27.570 --> 19:29.640
Come here, chuckleheads.

19:32.650 --> 19:34.600
This is the real phone.

19:34.650 --> 19:37.320
Now, you're gonna plant one right here,

19:37.370 --> 19:39.360
or l'll press send,

19:39.410 --> 19:42.760
and everybody'll know
your precious little secret.

19:42.810 --> 19:45.560
Miley, just close your eyes.
lt'll be over before you know it.

19:45.610 --> 19:48.880
No, it won't. lt'll never end.

19:48.930 --> 19:52.160
He's going to hold this over me
for the rest of my life.

19:52.210 --> 19:55.320
Passion and brains. l repeat...

19:57.770 --> 20:00.160
Okay, listen here, rinky-dink.

20:00.210 --> 20:03.170
Go ahead. Send the picture,

20:03.210 --> 20:07.880
but if you think it's going to impress
anybody at this school, you're wrong.

20:07.930 --> 20:09.920
Sure, they'll know my secret,

20:09.970 --> 20:13.080
but they'll also know
what a pathetic loser you are.

20:13.130 --> 20:15.480
So press send.

20:16.130 --> 20:18.720
Nothing can be much worse than this.

20:23.210 --> 20:25.280
Here. You win.

20:26.210 --> 20:27.320
Really?

20:27.370 --> 20:31.490
Yeah. lt's just that l've always been
the youngest in my class

20:31.530 --> 20:33.040
and the smallest,

20:33.090 --> 20:37.600
and just once l wanted to fit in.
To be cool.

20:41.010 --> 20:43.160
You smell like wet monkey.

20:44.530 --> 20:49.320
And to get a girl like you to kiss me,
well, that'd be the coolest thing ever.

20:51.970 --> 20:54.930
Rico, hold on.

20:54.970 --> 20:57.360
You know, if you'd been this real
with me from the beginning,

20:57.410 --> 20:59.320
things might have been different.

20:59.370 --> 21:00.520
You mean you would've kissed me?

21:00.570 --> 21:05.240
l'm not talking major lip lock,
but a little cheek action. Sure.

21:05.290 --> 21:08.800
When you treat people nice, Rico,
they're gonna treat you nice back.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.920
As a matter of fact...

21:12.490 --> 21:16.880
Come here, handsome,
'cause you know l can't resist you.

21:20.890 --> 21:24.770
Yes! He shoots, he scores!

21:24.810 --> 21:26.600
He's toast!

21:27.490 --> 21:29.360
You better run, pal.

21:30.730 --> 21:32.880
l've never seen her so mad.

21:33.530 --> 21:37.240
Wait till you see what Rico thought
was her big secret.

21:43.170 --> 21:45.320
Help, monkey, help!

22:01.450 --> 22:03.120
How's it going?

22:17.450 --> 22:19.800
Can l get a little more syrup?
