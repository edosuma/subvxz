What's that about?

Yes, it's because
over the years on this show,

They say you don't own a cat,
it owns you.

02:31.667 --> 02:34.466
Which is why the phrase
"herding cats"

02:34.467 --> 02:37.266
is synonymous with impossible.

So, what do you think
we should start with?

I think we should find someone

for a living

in the herding of animals,

And what it comes to herding,

03:24.567 --> 03:27.599
the best way to learn
is by observing.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.566
So, Debbie gives the guys
some pointers

feather them in.

as the porkers got porkier.

So, this myth says

17:30.900 --> 17:34.066
that catching a greased pig
is impossible.

But we've shown that,

26:09.900 --> 26:12.066
Jamie:
Well, after all that wrangling,

26:12.067 --> 26:14.632
we took that 10 pounds of poop

26:14.633 --> 26:16.599
and put it into that bag.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.066
It fits in a five-pound bag.

26:19.067 --> 26:20.699
* hallelujah *

26:20.700 --> 26:22.766

It's mission accomplished.

26:22.767 --> 26:23.667
Or is it?

26:23.668 --> 26:25.166
We did it! We did it!

26:25.167 --> 26:27.532
Ten pounds of poop
in a five... uh-oh.

26:27.533 --> 26:28.832
Jamie:
How much does it weigh?

26:28.833 --> 26:31.366
It weighs 7½ pounds.

26:31.367 --> 26:33.166
Well, i guess that means
we squeezed

26:33.167 --> 26:35.132
2½ pounds of water out of it.

26:35.133 --> 26:37.799
Most poop, or all poop,
has water in it,

26:37.800 --> 26:40.432
and if we squeezed it out,
we ought to put it back.

26:40.433 --> 26:41.666
It's part of the poop.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.266
I feel like that's cheating.

26:43.267 --> 26:44.599
Water's not poop.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.232
This is poop.

26:46.233 --> 26:47.432
I think this equals poop,

26:47.433 --> 26:49.066
and this is what we need
to put in here.

26:49.067 --> 26:51.499
It's amazing what kind of
philosophical discussions

26:51.500 --> 26:54.399
you can get into
in trying to put poop in a bag.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.866
You would think
it would be simpler.

26:56.867 --> 27:00.066
Narrator: Yep, this myth
confuses volumes and mass.

27:00.067 --> 27:03.899
Five pounds of poop fits the bag
with no room to spare.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.299
But when we compact 10 pounds,

27:06.300 --> 27:08.632
which had
twice the initial volume,

27:08.633 --> 27:11.066
it now fits into the same bag.

27:11.067 --> 27:14.232
However, the water that's lost
during compression

27:14.233 --> 27:16.366
means the bag no longer weighs

27:16.367 --> 27:18.732
the 10 pounds it's supposed to.

27:18.733 --> 27:20.599
So, how to call it?

27:20.600 --> 27:23.132
Jamie: On the one hand, we were
able to take 10 pounds of poop

27:23.133 --> 27:25.299
and fit it into
a five-pound bag.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.299
So, you might say
we were successful.

27:27.300 --> 27:30.099
But on the other hand,
in that process,

27:30.100 --> 27:32.366
we lost a couple pounds
of liquid,

27:32.367 --> 27:36.766
so the final resulting bag
weighs less than 10 pounds.

27:36.767 --> 27:39.966
So, you would say
that we were unsuccessful.

27:39.967 --> 27:41.632
I'm inclined
to accept the latter,

27:41.633 --> 27:43.666
because by definition,

27:43.667 --> 27:45.632
if you're taking
10 pounds of poop

27:45.633 --> 27:47.666
and putting it
in a five-pound bag,

27:47.667 --> 27:50.499
that bag ought to weigh
10 pounds.

27:50.500 --> 27:53.066
Now, that may be a little bit
of a crappy conclusion,

27:53.067 --> 27:54.499
but, heck,

27:54.500 --> 27:56.100

a greased pig has been comical,

28:08.067 --> 28:11.732
but not impossible.

28:11.733 --> 28:14.332
So now, the team
is getting competitive.

28:14.333 --> 28:16.332
Kari:
Whoo! You did it!

28:16.333 --> 28:17.532
Now, we are back

28:17.533 --> 28:19.632
with our own inventions
to catch pigs.

28:19.633 --> 28:22.332
Now, as it stands, it took kari
a minute to catch hers,

28:22.333 --> 28:24.099
it took Grant two minutes
to catch his,

28:24.100 --> 28:25.932
and it took me
a whole five minutes.

28:25.933 --> 28:29.366
We're going to do it again
and see who comes on top.

28:29.367 --> 28:33.766
Narrator:
Yep, and first to try for
the pig-catching cup is kari,

28:33.767 --> 28:37.199
who's keeping it simple
with a bait-and-pick strategy.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.332
Kari: Okay, so hopefully...

28:40.333 --> 28:44.299
He'll stop, get a snack,
and then bam.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.299
Narrator: The gloves are on,
but will they mean

28:46.300 --> 28:49.433
kari can catch
this greased oinker with ease?

28:51.633 --> 28:53.166
He's getting
really slippery now.

28:53.167 --> 28:54.832
All right, let's, uh...
Hang on. I'm good.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.932
All right. You ready?
You ready, kari?

the pigs, got gloves.

29:44.733 --> 29:46.932
Two, they gripped perfectly,

29:46.933 --> 29:49.599
and the pig, when i grabbed on,
didn't seem to mind.

29:49.600 --> 29:51.466
It was like,
"oh, i like this."

29:51.467 --> 29:54.432
Kari:
I am just like a pig in mud,

29:54.433 --> 29:57.666

this glove thing worked out.

29:57.667 --> 30:00.966
I didn't have to touch

30:00.967 --> 30:02.666

with a much softer
but firm grip.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.032
And it all worked out.

30:07.033 --> 30:10.199
Narrator: Simplicity
was the key to kari's success.

But can Grant beat
his two-minute target

30:13.200 --> 30:15.432

Okay, and start the time!

30:18.867 --> 30:20.799

ain't bad, right?

have a weakness for toys,
