00:04.464 --> 00:07.801
<i>Today marks three months
since Batman's defeat of the Mutant leader...</i>

00:07.967 --> 00:09.678
<i>... at the West River drainage site.</i>

00:09.844 --> 00:12.639
<i>The Mutants have adopted
Batman's methods as their own...</i>

00:12.806 --> 00:15.266
<i>... leading to a series of brutal attacks
on criminals.</i>

00:15.433 --> 00:17.394
<i>So psychopaths go after bad guys?</i>

00:17.560 --> 00:19.854
<i>Who cares?
Why blame Batman, for chrissakes?</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:22.482
<i>And in these strange times, people ask:</i>

00:22.649 --> 00:25.276
<i>"Has Gotham traded one evil
for another?"</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:31.616
<i>This is the face of the future.
Let Gotham's criminals beware.</i>

00:31.783 --> 00:34.411
<i>Gotham City belongs to the Batman.</i>

00:34.577 --> 00:37.789
<i>That statement came from the self-named
Sons of Batman...</i>

00:37.956 --> 00:41.251
<i>... shortly after the body of a known
drug dealer was found murdered...</i>

00:41.418 --> 00:44.838
<i>... in an East Side tenement.
One of several splinter groups that formed...</i>

00:45.004 --> 00:48.258
<i>... from the Mutant gang after their leader
was defeated by the Batman.</i>

00:48.425 --> 00:49.467
<i>They're using his name.</i>

00:49.634 --> 00:52.929
<i>He could at least release a clear statement
against what they're doing.</i>

00:53.096 --> 00:56.558
<i>The Batman doesn't exactly come out
with statements to the press.</i>

00:56.725 --> 00:59.310
<i>No, he can't, because he's an outlaw.</i>

00:59.477 --> 01:01.730
<i>How are the Sons of Batman
his responsibility?</i>

01:01.896 --> 01:04.649
- <i>He didn't create them.</i>
- <i>He absolutely did.</i>

01:04.816 --> 01:07.736
<i>They exist because
Batman broke up the larger gang.</i>

01:07.902 --> 01:09.237
<i>And we're better off for it.</i>

01:09.404 --> 01:12.115
<i>Would you prefer the Mutant leader
still be running things?</i>

01:12.282 --> 01:14.159
<i>This Sons of Batman thing is exactly...</i>

01:14.325 --> 01:17.537
<i>... why we didn't want these
costumed heroes around 10 years ago...</i>

01:17.704 --> 01:19.664
<i>... and why Batman
shouldn't have come back.</i>

01:19.831 --> 01:21.791
<i>Because of their effect on our youth...</i>

01:21.958 --> 01:25.503
<i>... on the public, on the media,
you get copycats.</i>

01:25.670 --> 01:30.008
I see my favorite patient is up and about.
Just super to see how well you're doing.

01:30.175 --> 01:34.179
- For years it seemed like you didn't have...
- A reason to go on.

01:34.429 --> 01:35.680
Exactly.

01:35.847 --> 01:39.100
- I saw you on the TV last night.
- Oh, that.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.728
I get invited on the talk-show circuit
now and then.

01:41.895 --> 01:45.523
Must be wonderful to get to tell
your side of things.

01:45.690 --> 01:49.360
I know the world has every reason
to hate me.

01:49.527 --> 01:53.531
Don't say that.
I always say, "Hate never heals."

01:53.698 --> 01:57.243
But it's so disheartening.

02:03.833 --> 02:06.336
<i>I wish Batman could go public,
but the police...</i>

02:06.503 --> 02:09.881
I bet I could arrange an appearance for you
on one of the shows.

02:10.048 --> 02:11.966
The home would have to approve
a day pass.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.553
They'll insist I be right beside you
at all times, even on-stage.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.557
Oh, please.
No one wants to hear from me.

02:19.724 --> 02:22.060
I think they'll fight for the chance
to book you.

02:22.227 --> 02:24.521
I'll make some calls right now.

02:25.230 --> 02:28.149
<i>What I think we should do is trust Batman...</i>

02:28.316 --> 02:31.903
<i>... at least for the time being.
He's saved us before.</i>

02:32.070 --> 02:35.323
<i>Public uproar over</i>
The Dave Endochrine Show's <i>announcement...</i>

02:35.490 --> 02:38.243
<i>... that Joker will be appearing
as a guest this week...</i>

02:38.409 --> 02:40.036
<i>... while media analysts predict...</i>

02:40.203 --> 02:43.206
<i>... it'll be Endochrine's
highest-rated episode in years.</i>

02:43.373 --> 02:46.668
<i>Meanwhile, the White House
continues to decline comment on...</i>

02:46.835 --> 02:48.586
<i>... the Batman's renewed activities...</i>

02:48.753 --> 02:51.714
<i>... and the suggestion
that his defiance is an embarrassment...</i>

02:51.881 --> 02:53.591
<i>... to the current administration.</i>

02:53.758 --> 02:55.844
<i>A White House spokesman
only volunteered...</i>

02:56.010 --> 02:58.513
<i>... that the president would deal
with the situation...</i>

02:58.680 --> 03:01.766
<i>... if and when appropriate
and in his own way.</i>

03:01.933 --> 03:06.229
Son, you know
I like to keep you out of domestic affairs...

03:06.396 --> 03:09.274
- ... what with all the ruckus you stir up.
- Yes, sir.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.776
But, well, it's a ruckus...

03:11.943 --> 03:13.611
... I'd like you to straighten out.

03:13.778 --> 03:16.281
Involving a friend of yours
in Gotham City.

03:16.447 --> 03:20.702
It's all well and good to have
a wild bronco on the ranch now and then.

03:20.869 --> 03:23.121
Does the hands good to break him in.

03:23.288 --> 03:26.249
But if the bronco up
and kicks over the fence...

03:26.416 --> 03:28.793
... and gets all the other horses crazy...

03:28.960 --> 03:32.380
- ... well, that's bad for business.
- I understand, sir.

03:32.547 --> 03:37.385
Now, I'm not asking you to put him down.
Not yet, anyway. But settle him.

03:37.552 --> 03:40.638
Ride him around the yard
a few times if you have to.

03:40.805 --> 03:44.309
- You know what I'm asking.
- Sir, I can talk to him but...

03:44.475 --> 03:47.520
I'd just hate for things to get out of hand.

03:47.687 --> 03:50.231
You know, how to get in touch with him,
don't you, son?

03:50.398 --> 03:54.319
- He's not hard to find, sir.
- Good boy.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.331
- What are you?
- We Bruno's.

04:06.497 --> 04:07.832
We nasty.

04:07.999 --> 04:09.834
Bruno? Who's he?

04:12.003 --> 04:16.048
- Bruno is a she.
- Ha. Big she.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.675
Kind of my nasty.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.093
Aces, Don.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.388
Bruno Joker's squeeze.
He billy berserkest ever.

04:22.555 --> 04:25.516
Yeah. Joker king of the billy.

04:25.767 --> 04:28.436
Eh. Maybe he make us Jokers.

04:28.603 --> 04:31.356
You Mutant kids go from
one boss to the next.

04:31.522 --> 04:35.652
- Too young to make your own decisions?
- We not kids. We make decisions.

04:35.818 --> 04:38.738
- You even old enough to drink?
- Course we drink.

04:38.905 --> 04:42.367
We slicer-dicers. We prove it.

04:56.506 --> 04:58.049
Guess you're Bruno.

04:58.216 --> 05:01.010
Those two morons don't have a brain
between them.

05:01.177 --> 05:03.221
So I'm gonna give them yours.

05:03.388 --> 05:05.223
All over their suits.

05:05.390 --> 05:07.433
Thief! You're a thief!

05:07.600 --> 05:10.853
Store on Seventh Street sells this for 2.50.

05:14.482 --> 05:15.984
Lady spud mine, Rob.

05:18.403 --> 05:19.862
I need the points.

06:06.034 --> 06:08.202
Hey, Bats! Bruno's taking off.

06:12.790 --> 06:17.295
Pull that trigger and I'll be back for you.

06:20.465 --> 06:23.426
<i>Pull that trigger and I'll be back for you.</i>

06:29.223 --> 06:30.391
Bruno's heading your way.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.643
<i>Lead her into the alley. Don't let her see you.</i>

06:32.810 --> 06:35.688
<i>Violate that order and you're fired.</i>

06:39.525 --> 06:40.902
Oh, yes.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.528
If you're lucky, Bruno,
you'll end up in jail tonight.

07:35.164 --> 07:38.876
But first you're gonna tell me what
Joker has planned for his TV appearance.

08:11.784 --> 08:12.910
Somebody do something.

08:14.245 --> 08:16.747
- There's a train coming!
- Do something!

08:18.749 --> 08:21.377
There's one more. It's coming!

08:41.731 --> 08:43.607
Tell me what Joker's planning.

08:45.693 --> 08:49.113
No. Not him. Not now.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.307
What is this? Unh.

09:24.273 --> 09:27.485
- We have to talk.
- I'm busy.

09:27.652 --> 09:31.822
My place, in the morning.
Until then, stay out of my way.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.665
Was that him?

09:48.464 --> 09:52.468
<i>Soviet representatives stormed out of talks
over the conflict in Corto Maltese today...</i>

09:52.677 --> 09:56.681
<i>... calling American military presence
in the region pure fascist aggression...</i>

09:56.847 --> 09:59.725
<i>... and pledging total military commitment
to ousting the U. S...</i>

09:59.892 --> 10:01.811
<i>... from the Latin American island nation.</i>

10:01.978 --> 10:05.690
<i>Well, all that sounds like to me
is the bluster of bullies.</i>

10:05.856 --> 10:08.985
<i>And we don't back down from bullies.
No, sir, we don't.</i>

10:09.151 --> 10:11.112
<i>Mr. President!</i>

10:12.989 --> 10:15.658
<i>How about that smartly dressed youngster
in the front row?</i>

10:15.825 --> 10:18.869
<i>Mr. President, what's your position
on the Batman controversy?</i>

10:19.036 --> 10:22.456
<i>It was our understanding the government
reached an arrangement with him...</i>

10:22.623 --> 10:25.293
<i>... and his colleagues years ago
to cease their activities.</i>

10:25.459 --> 10:27.670
<i>Doesn't his return defy that arrangement?</i>

10:28.170 --> 10:32.049
<i>Well, can't say I know
what arrangement you're talking about.</i>

10:32.216 --> 10:36.137
<i>But as for what's going on in Gotham,
it's not my row to hoe, now is it?</i>

10:36.304 --> 10:39.181
<i>That's a matter for the state level,
and they've got a solid...</i>

10:39.348 --> 10:41.392
<i>... clearheaded governor there,
yes, they do.</i>

10:42.059 --> 10:44.312
<i>Sorry, guys,
I've got a whole state to run...</i>

10:44.478 --> 10:47.189
<i>... and I trust the judgment
of Mayor Stevenson on that.</i>

10:47.565 --> 10:51.235
<i>My job is to administrate,
not render moral judgments.</i>

10:51.402 --> 10:53.696
<i>We've just appointed
a new police commissioner...</i>

10:53.863 --> 10:55.489
<i>... and I'm not about to interfere.</i>

10:55.948 --> 10:59.910
<i>The job will officially change hands from
outgoing Commissioner James Gordon...</i>

11:00.077 --> 11:03.414
<i>... to incoming Ellen Yindel
at a formal dinner this evening.</i>

11:03.581 --> 11:06.500
<i>Neither has commented yet
on Ms. Yindel's plans.</i>

11:20.639 --> 11:24.393
To try to quote Ellen Yindel's
outstanding record in the time I have...

11:24.560 --> 11:26.103
... would do her a disservice.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.190
Instead I offer the new commissioner
my sympathy...

11:29.357 --> 11:32.526
... knowing the impossible job
she is about to face.

11:32.693 --> 11:36.864
The life-and-death decisions.
The city of thieves and murderers...

11:37.031 --> 11:40.785
... and honest people too afraid to hope.

11:40.951 --> 11:44.413
Recently, a man returned
to the public eye...

11:44.580 --> 11:48.417
... who refuses to do nothing
while chaos runs rampant.

11:48.584 --> 11:53.464
A man who shows us
we can seize our city back from fear.

11:53.631 --> 11:56.801
Many have asked
how I can condone this man.

11:56.967 --> 12:01.889
My answer is that we all have something,
or someone, worth fighting for.

12:02.056 --> 12:03.808
I have my wife, Sarah.

12:03.974 --> 12:06.644
Any time I wonder
if I'm doing the right thing...

12:06.811 --> 12:09.480
... I think of Sarah, and the rest is easy.

12:10.022 --> 12:13.317
Now it's Commissioner Yindel's turn
to face this man.

12:13.484 --> 12:17.530
She may make him her enemy,
or maybe she'll learn from him.

12:17.696 --> 12:20.866
Either way, I wish her well.

12:26.997 --> 12:27.998
Thank you.

12:28.165 --> 12:31.585
James Gordon dedicated his life
to keeping this city safe...

12:31.752 --> 12:34.422
... and I'm honored
to share a stage with him.

12:34.588 --> 12:39.510
But this office will no longer tolerate
the actions of a criminal.

12:39.677 --> 12:44.849
As my first official act as commissioner,
on the charges of breaking and entering...

12:45.015 --> 12:48.102
... assault and battery,
and creating a public menace...

12:48.269 --> 12:51.814
... I hereby issue a warrant
for the Batman's arrest.

13:04.702 --> 13:07.204
You cost me hours of work last night.

13:07.371 --> 13:10.541
Then I'll get right to it.
You have to go back into retirement.

13:10.708 --> 13:12.293
You're upsetting too many people.

13:12.460 --> 13:13.961
Mm-hm.

13:14.128 --> 13:17.965
Why do you always have to be like this?
You played right into their hands last time.

13:18.132 --> 13:21.385
When the parents groups came after us,
you're the one they pointed to.

13:21.552 --> 13:22.636
You act like a criminal.

13:22.803 --> 13:26.974
Heh, we are criminals, Clark.
We always have been.

13:27.141 --> 13:30.811
You're still one too.
Only difference is you have a boss.

13:33.522 --> 13:34.899
And you answer to no one.

13:36.859 --> 13:39.111
You know, we almost
had this talk 10 years ago...

13:39.278 --> 13:41.697
... when you wouldn't go along
with the deal we made.

13:41.864 --> 13:44.325
Everyone else agreed.
Diana went back to her people...

13:44.492 --> 13:45.868
... Hal left the planet.

13:46.035 --> 13:48.078
And Oliver? Did he agree?

13:50.331 --> 13:51.916
That's not how I wanted that to go.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.043
He was all torn up about it too.

13:54.210 --> 13:57.922
- He made it necessary. Like...
- Like I'm about to?

13:58.797 --> 14:03.010
- Do you even remember why you retired?
- I remember.

14:03.886 --> 14:07.556
Look. Either shut it down or
one of these days someone with authority...

14:07.723 --> 14:09.475
... is gonna tell me to come stop you.

14:09.642 --> 14:11.936
- And when that happens...
- When that happens...

14:12.102 --> 14:13.854
... may the best man win.

14:15.189 --> 14:17.024
I have to go. We'll finish this later.

14:22.905 --> 14:25.032
No hurry.

14:25.616 --> 14:29.328
<i>Brave American forces
are now engaged in direct combat...</i>

14:29.495 --> 14:32.581
<i>... with Soviet troops in Corto Maltese.</i>

14:32.748 --> 14:36.627
<i>Now, those Soviets would like to see us
turn our tails and run.</i>

14:36.794 --> 14:41.257
<i>But we've got to protect our interest...
I mean, stand up for freedom...</i>

14:41.423 --> 14:43.551
<i>... and the good people of Corto Maltese.</i>

14:43.717 --> 14:47.263
<i>So don't you fret.
We've got God on our side.</i>

14:47.429 --> 14:50.349
<i>Or the next best thing, anyway.</i>

15:15.833 --> 15:19.837
<i>We got a sweet show tonight, folks.
Dr. Ruth Heizraumer...</i>

15:20.004 --> 15:21.755
<i>... the wet hamburger bun contest...</i>

15:21.922 --> 15:24.675
<i>... and a man who's brought
a lot of smiles to the world.</i>

15:24.842 --> 15:26.635
<i>See you then.</i>

15:26.802 --> 15:29.847
It was great to hear from you, boss.
Most of the other guys...

15:30.014 --> 15:33.100
... well, they gave up on you.
But I knew you'd come back.

15:33.267 --> 15:37.855
Oh, you look great. Anyway,
I whipped up the lipstick you asked for.

15:38.022 --> 15:40.899
And Bobby and Mary,
they can't wait to help.

15:41.066 --> 15:44.486
Oh, I also made you these,
special filters.

15:44.653 --> 15:48.032
Wear them tonight
and only breathe through your nose.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.160
And all these years I just held my breath.

15:51.327 --> 15:52.494
Really?

15:53.078 --> 15:55.831
I could kiss you.

16:03.047 --> 16:07.176
Robin's last class is about to end.
Go pick her up at school.

16:07.343 --> 16:10.846
And if Miss Kelley should have something
better to do with her evening?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.432
There's nothing better.

16:13.891 --> 16:16.226
Where you been all this time?
You're, like, gone.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.603
Been busy.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.897
You gonna make
it to the fairgrounds tomorrow?

16:20.064 --> 16:21.899
Opening day? Our tradition?

16:22.066 --> 16:23.901
Ugh. It's this night job.

16:24.068 --> 16:25.736
Details. As in more.

16:25.903 --> 16:29.365
Just helping some spud. It'd bore you.

16:31.659 --> 16:33.452
Gotta fly.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.623
Hey, Alfred.

17:05.317 --> 17:08.945
First two teams are with me
on the roof, the rest of you are down here.

17:09.113 --> 17:11.031
I'm not waiting for the Joker.

17:11.198 --> 17:15.911
And you can bet Batman isn't either.
Neither of them is leaving here a free man.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.871
- Is that understood?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.716
More on the eyes, please.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.551
You want lipstick, handsome?

17:30.718 --> 17:34.513
I brought my own, thanks.

17:35.973 --> 17:39.059
Wonderful to see you
showing such interest.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.651
Okay, Bobby, Mary,
Uncle Joker's counting on you.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.278
Go make him proud.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.702
This is strictly
an observation mission for you.

17:56.869 --> 18:00.164
Stay in the copter
and do not touch any of the controls.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.750
If there's any trouble, just say "boosters."

18:02.916 --> 18:06.670
The computer's all voice-controlled.
You don't need to understand a thing.

18:07.504 --> 18:09.298
Figure I wouldn't anyway.

18:16.680 --> 18:19.683
Joker's thought this through.
The publicity's brought the cops...

18:19.850 --> 18:21.894
... and they'll keep me from him.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.150
That a cloak?

18:28.984 --> 18:30.152
Cool.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.613
<i>Commissioner, something's incoming.</i>

18:32.780 --> 18:35.491
- <i>We can't get a lock on it.</i>
- I don't see anything.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.996
Everything's on auto.
Touch any of it and you're fired.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.498
Cool, boss.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.628
Keep at it! Do a channel sweep.

18:48.754 --> 18:49.838
Holy...

18:51.715 --> 18:54.635
- He can fly.
- Not for long. Hit the flood!

19:10.484 --> 19:13.320
Batman, you are under arrest.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.718
Fox, Stokes, rush him!

19:36.885 --> 19:39.137
- Rush him?
- He's twice your age, son.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.597
Find the nerve.

19:51.567 --> 19:55.946
What can we say about our next guest
that hasn't been said before? Frank?

19:56.113 --> 20:00.784
He's a kook, Dave. A maniac.
No, I mean it, he's a nut.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.287
Nothing like it, eh?

20:03.453 --> 20:06.915
I always take this moment
to say a little affirmation to myself.

20:07.082 --> 20:10.794
So many faces. So few smiles.

20:10.961 --> 20:15.716
Hey, now, no need to be nervous.
Just follow my lead and be yourself.

20:18.969 --> 20:22.723
And our special guest,
the Clown Prince of Crime...

20:22.890 --> 20:24.641
... Joker.

20:37.946 --> 20:40.657
Get a copter in close to blow
this stuff away!

20:45.412 --> 20:47.331
Freeze, Batman!

20:59.676 --> 21:01.637
Fire weapons.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.350
Do something!

21:19.446 --> 21:22.699
Joker, you've asked for a chance
to share your side of things.

21:22.866 --> 21:25.452
I'm told you've killed
about 600 people.

21:25.619 --> 21:28.705
- How exactly does your side of that go?
- Stop right there.

21:28.872 --> 21:32.668
This is a sensitive man,
and I won't have him being harassed.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.879
That's all right. I want people to get me.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.547
All right, then.

21:41.009 --> 21:44.888
That's why I'm gonna kill everyone
in this room.

21:46.223 --> 21:47.307
Okay.

21:47.474 --> 21:50.143
I think that's a little more insight
than we had in mind.

21:50.310 --> 21:52.562
It's okay, he doesn't really mean that.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.564
He's just trying to ease the tension.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.066
Funny way to go about it.

21:56.233 --> 21:59.861
You have to remember,
this man isn't responsible for those killings.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.990
He's merely a victim of the Batman's
psychotic obsession.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.742
I thought
I was Batman's psychotic obsession.

22:07.244 --> 22:09.663
So you think the Batman's
the real sicko here.

22:09.830 --> 22:13.208
Without a doubt. He's an
obsessive-compulsive, narcissistic...

22:13.375 --> 22:15.460
... hero-complexed sociopath.

22:15.627 --> 22:19.631
- I would love a shot at him as a patient.
- Do guests get to keep these?

22:19.798 --> 22:25.262
Heh. Sure, you do whatever you want with it.
We got a closet full of them.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.395
So long as you won't miss it.

22:45.949 --> 22:49.745
Breathe, David. Breathe.

23:33.205 --> 23:34.331
Billy close.

23:35.957 --> 23:38.126
Ace the cloak.

23:58.855 --> 24:01.358
Batman, land your vehicle now!

24:01.525 --> 24:03.568
Been following on the radio.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.613
It's over. Joker's gone.

24:07.614 --> 24:11.201
- How many?
- Don't know. Lots.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.995
You have five seconds to comply.

24:15.831 --> 24:17.541
Boosters.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.837
- Boosters!
- Peel.

24:30.345 --> 24:32.347
Head back to the cave.

24:32.514 --> 24:35.559
- I'm not fired?
- You're not fired.

24:41.731 --> 24:44.693
<i>The military has imposed
a communications blackout...</i>

24:44.860 --> 24:48.363
<i>... for the 500-mile area
surrounding Corto Maltese...</i>

24:48.530 --> 24:52.242
<i>... amid reports of severe weather
affecting the ongoing battle.</i>

25:54.095 --> 25:55.430
<i>While more locally...</i>

25:55.597 --> 25:58.600
<i>... tragedy struck at today's taping
of</i> The Dave Endochrine Show...

25:58.767 --> 26:03.063
<i>... where Joker used his deadly smile gas
to kill the entire audience.</i>

26:03.230 --> 26:05.565
<i>Joker is now reported to be on the loose...</i>

26:05.732 --> 26:09.986
<i>... as is the Batman,
who tangled with police at the scene.</i>

26:12.030 --> 26:13.990
You never should have come back, Bruce.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.618
You don't know
how much the world has changed.

26:16.785 --> 26:17.953
Selina.

26:31.174 --> 26:34.135
I need your help. It's very important.

26:44.396 --> 26:45.480
My help.

26:46.648 --> 26:50.694
I made myself pretty for you.
You should say thank you.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.153
Thank you.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.531
That's better.

26:55.198 --> 26:58.868
Ee. The years have not been kind,
have they?

26:59.035 --> 27:02.289
Anyhoo,
I have a little errand for one of your girls.

27:02.455 --> 27:03.665
I think her name's Elsie.

27:03.832 --> 27:07.377
She has a date
with a congressman tonight?

27:07.544 --> 27:11.715
<i>The death toll in the wake
of Joker's attack stands at 206...</i>

27:11.881 --> 27:15.385
<i>... including host Dave Endochrine
and Joker's own doctor...</i>

27:15.552 --> 27:17.053
<i>... Bartholomew Wolper.</i>

27:17.846 --> 27:21.057
- How do you fight someone like that?
- Simpler than I've made it.

27:21.224 --> 27:24.227
There's nothing wrong with Joker
that I can't fix.

27:24.394 --> 27:25.729
With my hands.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.856
<i>Both Joker and the Batman...</i>

27:28.023 --> 27:30.984
<i>... who himself left dozens of police
hospitalized...</i>

27:31.151 --> 27:33.069
<i>... are now fugitives from the law.</i>

27:37.407 --> 27:39.409
Oh, Elsie.

27:43.413 --> 27:46.041
There's something I need you to do,
congressman.

27:46.207 --> 27:49.252
- Will you do it?
- Yes, Elsie.

27:50.462 --> 27:53.590
He'll want me to pick up his trail.
This is his game.

27:54.215 --> 27:56.176
- He'll want it to go on.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

27:56.343 --> 27:59.012
<i>We're going now
to Ben Derrick, live in Midtown...</i>

27:59.179 --> 28:01.014
<i>... where a shocking story is unfolding.</i>

28:01.181 --> 28:04.059
<i>Lola, I'm standing outside
the Gotham Vista Hotel...</i>

28:04.225 --> 28:06.561
<i>... where Congressman
Hector Alejandro Noches...</i>

28:06.728 --> 28:08.938
<i>... has climbed out onto a 40th-story ledge...</i>

28:09.105 --> 28:12.275
<i>... and is demanding a full nuclear
strike against Corto Maltese.</i>

28:20.909 --> 28:24.079
You don't think they'll launch
their nukes over this?

28:24.245 --> 28:25.580
We have to strike first!

28:25.747 --> 28:27.957
We're the most powerful country
in the world.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.459
Sir, please.

28:32.629 --> 28:35.715
<i>Lola, it's just confusion
and one messy body down here right now.</i>

28:35.882 --> 28:39.594
<i>Commissioner Yindel has arrived on the scene.
I'll see if I can get a statement.</i>

28:39.761 --> 28:41.763
Commissioner,
any word on why the congressman...?

28:41.930 --> 28:43.515
Get those cameras behind the line!

28:46.017 --> 28:48.686
Commissioner. O'Halloran, 6th precinct.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.022
- Lieutenant.
- Any way I can help?

28:51.189 --> 28:53.983
This wasn't a suicide.
The girl upstairs has been drugged.

28:54.150 --> 28:57.904
- Says she's from Kyle Escorts.
- That's Selina Kyle. My old beat.

28:58.071 --> 29:01.825
- Shut it down and bring her in.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:01.991 --> 29:03.284
Commissioner.

29:03.451 --> 29:06.371
Lieutenant O'Halloran, ma'am.
Heard there was...

29:06.538 --> 29:08.498
- Is something wrong?
- Stop that man!

29:21.678 --> 29:23.847
All units to Kyle Escorts.

29:49.372 --> 29:51.124
Selina.

29:55.545 --> 29:57.172
Bruce...

29:58.089 --> 30:01.509
... he's worse than ever.
He's using lipstick...

30:01.676 --> 30:02.802
... mind control.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.808
The police are going to be here soon.
Can you walk?

30:09.809 --> 30:11.686
I think so.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.689
Boss, found something.

30:14.856 --> 30:16.232
Cotton candy.

30:16.399 --> 30:17.859
The fairgrounds.

30:18.026 --> 30:19.319
Thousands will be there.

30:19.486 --> 30:20.904
Half my friends will be there.

30:21.070 --> 30:23.406
- Fan out.
- Bring the Wing in close.

30:23.573 --> 30:24.908
Don't take the girl.

30:25.074 --> 30:27.118
- He'll...
- Don't worry.

30:28.578 --> 30:30.580
On the ground. Now.

30:56.523 --> 30:59.484
Good soldier. Good soldier.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.666
Boss, something's coming.

31:14.832 --> 31:17.627
- It's big. It's...
- Him.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.926
He's there. Hold tight.

31:32.141 --> 31:35.478
Children, do you know
why all these people are so upset?

31:35.645 --> 31:38.106
That bad man up there.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.651
Bobby, you know what to do.

31:50.493 --> 31:53.746
- Incoming.
- Wait, let it get closer.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.715
Don't worry, Mary dear.

32:03.881 --> 32:10.179
You two distract the little one,
and I'll handle the bad man.

32:45.089 --> 32:47.800
Are you out of your mind?

32:49.719 --> 32:52.013
I'm through playing, Joker.

32:52.722 --> 32:55.141
Be still, my heart.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.412
Don't leave in such a rush.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.082
- Unh.
- Aah!

33:41.062 --> 33:43.856
You're the Joker, right?
Batman's gonna kick your ass.

33:44.023 --> 33:47.026
He's gonna have to go through you first.

33:52.949 --> 33:54.784
Let the boy go, Joker.

34:19.766 --> 34:20.935
Oh, that's bad.

34:21.101 --> 34:24.480
You should get that looked at
when you have a chance.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.534
He's got a gun.

35:18.701 --> 35:20.703
Freeze, Joker.

35:51.943 --> 35:53.569
Excuse me, sorry. Beg your pardon.

35:53.736 --> 35:56.364
Coming through. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.

35:56.531 --> 36:00.493
Ooh, my bad. Excuse me.

36:30.439 --> 36:32.400
No more.

36:36.404 --> 36:40.950
All the people I've murdered
by letting you live.

36:41.784 --> 36:44.078
I never kept count.

36:44.954 --> 36:46.789
- I did.
- I know.

36:49.709 --> 36:51.711
And I love you for it.

37:01.721 --> 37:05.308
It's finally here, isn't it?
The moment we've both dreamed about.

37:10.938 --> 37:13.482
Oh, don't tell me you're gonna fall asleep
before we finish.

37:14.108 --> 37:17.486
You have gotten old, haven't you?

37:21.991 --> 37:25.786
Not quite how I imagined it...

37:26.495 --> 37:29.498
... but we can still end on a high note.

37:46.974 --> 37:50.102
You're in trouble now.

37:53.856 --> 37:55.024
Go ahead.

37:55.650 --> 37:58.694
Say this has never happened
to you before.

37:59.403 --> 38:00.529
Shut up.

38:00.696 --> 38:02.740
Make me.

38:02.907 --> 38:05.368
Come on, finish me.

38:10.581 --> 38:13.459
Doesn't matter. I win.

38:13.626 --> 38:16.212
I made you lose control.

38:19.548 --> 38:22.718
And they'll kill you for it.

38:26.222 --> 38:29.350
See you in hell.

38:57.336 --> 38:59.088
Keep going, down here.

39:01.632 --> 39:02.842
There's another body.

39:07.596 --> 39:10.516
Watch yourselves.
Witnesses saw both of them this way.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.398
Down this way. Go right.

39:18.482 --> 39:21.402
Robin, call the copter.

39:22.111 --> 39:24.488
Locate my signal.

39:36.959 --> 39:38.669
Don't touch him.

40:02.860 --> 40:04.904
Freeze, you son of a bitch. Unh.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.656
Cute gun.

40:07.823 --> 40:10.534
- Move forward.
- Keep your heads straight.

40:12.828 --> 40:14.497
How are we supposed to find him?

40:14.663 --> 40:16.415
If it isn't a cop, shoot it.

40:26.884 --> 40:28.844
- Over there.
- Clumsy.

40:37.561 --> 40:39.188
Stop laughing.

41:21.772 --> 41:23.691
Auto-pilot. Property damage.

43:02.289 --> 43:04.833
- He gonna make it?
- Suture.

43:10.381 --> 43:14.093
He'll live. He's far too stubborn to die.

43:18.138 --> 43:21.850
<i>Through this horrific murder
and his attacks on the police...</i>

43:22.017 --> 43:25.479
<i>... the Batman has revealed himself
to be an unqualified menace.</i>

43:25.646 --> 43:29.358
<i>I have asked the governor to place
the state police at Gotham City's disposal...</i>

43:29.525 --> 43:31.819
<i>... to hunt down this dangerous fugitive.</i>

43:31.986 --> 43:34.530
- No comment.
- Jim, you can't protect him anymore.

43:34.697 --> 43:36.198
<i>He's a murderer now.</i>

43:36.365 --> 43:38.701
<i>If you've talked to him,
you have to let me know.</i>

43:38.867 --> 43:40.536
He and I don't talk anymore.

43:40.703 --> 43:42.454
<i>I know everything I need to know.</i>

43:45.040 --> 43:47.334
<i>Joker's death and Batman's fugitive status...</i>

43:47.501 --> 43:51.839
<i>... have become more than local
or statewide issues these days.</i>

43:54.550 --> 43:57.886
<i>... and this morning,
White House spokesperson Melanie Endara...</i>

43:58.053 --> 44:01.724
<i>... said the FBI was providing
regular updates to the Oval Office...</i>

44:01.890 --> 44:04.643
<i>... on the progress police are making
in the hunt for Batman.</i>

44:04.810 --> 44:08.522
- The groceries? Now?
- Wanna eat tonight?

44:10.107 --> 44:12.318
I'm going.

44:14.862 --> 44:17.406
Be careful. And no cigars.

44:21.827 --> 44:25.414
<i>Another splinter group has emerged
from the remains of the Mutant army.</i>

44:25.581 --> 44:27.416
<i>Calling themselves the Nixons...</i>

44:27.583 --> 44:30.252
<i>... the group is committing
a spree of violent armed holdups...</i>

44:30.419 --> 44:33.255
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you a special report.</i>

44:33.422 --> 44:36.633
<i>We now go live to a statement
from the president of the United States.</i>

44:36.800 --> 44:40.554
<i>Well, folks, I've got some good news
and some bad news.</i>

44:40.721 --> 44:43.599
<i>The good news is that
our brave American troops...</i>

44:43.766 --> 44:46.101
<i>... were victorious in Corto Maltese...</i>

44:46.268 --> 44:49.063
<i>... and the Soviets
have completely withdrawn.</i>

44:49.229 --> 44:51.357
<i>Bad news is, well...</i>

44:51.523 --> 44:55.235
<i>... looks like those Russians
are some mighty sore losers.</i>

45:13.462 --> 45:16.465
<i>The warhead appears
to be on a course for Corto Maltese...</i>

45:16.632 --> 45:19.134
<i>... where 50,000 U.S. troops are stationed...</i>

45:19.301 --> 45:22.346
<i>... along with the 2 million citizens
of the small island.</i>

45:22.513 --> 45:25.140
<i>But the larger questions
on everyone's minds...</i>

45:25.307 --> 45:29.269
<i>... are whether this is the first strike
in a full-scale nuclear attack...</i>

45:29.436 --> 45:32.481
<i>... and whether the U.S.
has begun retaliation.</i>

45:57.339 --> 46:00.509
<i>We are getting reports
that the missile has changed course...</i>

46:00.676 --> 46:03.095
<i>... and will now detonate over an...</i>

46:06.432 --> 46:07.850
What happened?

47:41.068 --> 47:45.614
- What happened? Is he dead?
- No, he's quite alive.

47:45.781 --> 47:48.534
Appears the whole city
is having an outage.

47:50.577 --> 47:54.414
Odd that the emergency generator
hasn't kicked in.

47:57.209 --> 48:00.879
Aces. My cheapo watch stopped too.
Figure I didn't just buy it.

48:04.091 --> 48:06.134
- Boss.
- Show me.

48:10.514 --> 48:11.974
Clark...

48:12.724 --> 48:15.060
... you let them do it.

48:15.727 --> 48:17.312
You idiot.

48:17.479 --> 48:21.233
- What? What's happening?
- Sir, you have to rest.

48:21.400 --> 48:25.320
A blackout, our generator's dead,
and Robin's watch stopped.

48:25.487 --> 48:27.823
It's an electromagnetic pulse.

48:27.990 --> 48:30.409
In all likelihood, from a nuclear explosion.

48:30.576 --> 48:31.827
You don't know that.

48:34.121 --> 48:35.163
Oh, dear.

48:35.330 --> 48:37.666
We're still here.

48:39.751 --> 48:41.003
For the moment.

48:44.298 --> 48:47.467
May mean the Soviets
detonated a cold bringer.

48:47.634 --> 48:49.428
Not meant to kill us, just cripple us.

48:51.388 --> 48:55.100
- Ever ride a horse before?
- Don't think I've ever seen a horse before.

48:55.267 --> 48:58.061
You're about to learn fast.

49:03.025 --> 49:07.487
Not as fun as I thought it would be.

49:20.834 --> 49:22.836
This is our moment.

49:23.003 --> 49:24.880
Gotham is helpless.

49:25.047 --> 49:26.548
We will take charge.

49:26.715 --> 49:29.051
We will kill anyone who stands in our way.

49:30.552 --> 49:32.179
No.

49:46.485 --> 49:50.405
Tonight I am going to maintain order
in Gotham City.

49:50.572 --> 49:52.407
You are going to help me.

49:54.618 --> 49:56.078
But not with these.

49:56.244 --> 49:58.246
These are loud and clumsy.

49:58.413 --> 50:01.416
These are the weapons of cowards.

50:03.418 --> 50:05.587
Our weapons are precise and quiet.

50:05.754 --> 50:07.714
In time I will teach them to you.

50:07.881 --> 50:12.386
But for tonight, you will rely
on your brains and your fists.

50:12.552 --> 50:15.138
Tonight, we are the law.

50:15.305 --> 50:17.349
Tonight, I am the law.

50:27.275 --> 50:29.653
- Looters are gonna strip us dry.
- We need more cops.

50:29.820 --> 50:32.114
- We don't even have phone lines.
- One at a time.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.616
Commissioner, we got a problem.

51:21.037 --> 51:22.497
Slice and dice.

52:02.871 --> 52:07.626
- Hey, we need to put out the fires.
- Are you crazy? Let go of me.

52:09.211 --> 52:11.254
Get out of my store, huh. Get out of here.

52:24.851 --> 52:26.019
Listen up.

52:26.186 --> 52:28.063
This is our neighborhood.

52:28.230 --> 52:29.397
Our homes.

52:29.564 --> 52:31.691
We're better than this.

52:32.734 --> 52:36.571
The fires are spreading,
and the fire department isn't coming.

52:36.738 --> 52:39.407
So if any of you want roofs
over your heads tomorrow...

52:39.574 --> 52:42.702
... and the day after that, start helping.

52:45.497 --> 52:48.583
I have buckets.
Let's get those hydrants open.

52:48.750 --> 52:50.168
- All right.
- Yeah, right.

52:50.335 --> 52:51.378
Let's do it.

52:56.758 --> 52:59.928
- Here, let me help you.
- The drugstore has bandages.

53:17.237 --> 53:20.282
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

53:20.448 --> 53:23.785
... I'm here to appeal
to your community spirit.

53:23.952 --> 53:26.329
I know you've had your differences
in the past.

53:26.496 --> 53:29.124
Some of you will even argue
that you can't work together.

53:29.291 --> 53:30.458
That's fine.

53:30.625 --> 53:32.627
Those people will stay tied up.

53:32.794 --> 53:35.297
And it will not be a function
of which group you're in.

53:35.463 --> 53:39.134
What is this, the gestapo?
He lumps us together with criminals. Unh.

53:39.301 --> 53:40.385
Shut up, man.

53:40.552 --> 53:44.097
The rest of you can lend a hand
to keep our city from falling apart.

53:44.264 --> 53:46.182
You can lead by example.

53:46.349 --> 53:47.559
Your choice.

53:47.726 --> 53:49.644
I'm sure you're all eager to help.

54:08.330 --> 54:11.082
- I'm suing.
- Good luck with that.

54:15.962 --> 54:18.590
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

54:18.757 --> 54:20.675
He's too big.

54:20.842 --> 54:23.178
- All right.
- All right, keep it going, guys.

54:26.181 --> 54:28.642
- Come on.
- Keep working.

54:30.518 --> 54:33.146
- Come on, guys. Have that.
- More water.

54:48.203 --> 54:50.747
The fire is spreading to the East Side!

55:16.898 --> 55:17.899
Jim!

55:21.236 --> 55:22.737
Oh.

55:26.157 --> 55:29.661
<i>One week now that the U.S.
has been blanketed in a cloud of ash.</i>

55:29.828 --> 55:33.665
<i>Electricity is finally coming back online
in parts of the country...</i>

55:33.832 --> 55:37.711
<i>... but the impact on weather patterns
is expected to last much longer.</i>

55:37.877 --> 55:41.423
<i>It's high noon in Gotham City,
and yet there's no sun...</i>

55:41.589 --> 55:43.633
<i>... and it's the coldest day of the year.</i>

55:43.800 --> 55:45.260
<i>I don't know what to wear.</i>

55:45.427 --> 55:47.387
<i>Every major city in the country but one...</i>

55:47.554 --> 55:50.765
<i>... has descended into riots,
looting and other crimes.</i>

55:50.932 --> 55:53.351
<i>The president has imposed
limited martial law...</i>

55:53.518 --> 55:55.729
<i>... but this has been seen to have little effect.</i>

55:56.104 --> 55:58.064
<i>Only Gotham has maintained order...</i>

55:58.231 --> 56:00.942
<i>... thanks to the vigilante gang
being led by the Batman...</i>

56:01.109 --> 56:03.236
<i>... adding to the massive
credibility nightmare...</i>

56:03.403 --> 56:06.072
<i>... being experienced
by the president's administration.</i>

56:08.116 --> 56:11.911
- How are you feeling, son?
- Better, Mr. President. Thank you.

56:12.078 --> 56:14.039
Sorry I haven't been able to help more.

56:14.205 --> 56:18.126
Oh. This'll all blow over.
Don't you give it another thought.

56:18.585 --> 56:22.130
So long as you're up to handling
our other little problem now?

56:22.630 --> 56:23.631
Of course, sir.

56:23.798 --> 56:26.634
Though he'll never let me
bring him in alive.

56:26.801 --> 56:30.472
Well, you do what you need to do.

56:35.101 --> 56:37.228
You always did do it wrong, Bruce.

56:37.395 --> 56:40.148
Been five years since I busted out of jail...

56:40.315 --> 56:42.025
... and you know I've been busy.

56:42.192 --> 56:43.818
But I made it hard on them.

56:43.985 --> 56:45.945
They had to cover up my escape...

56:46.112 --> 56:48.281
... and now they have to cover up my work.

56:48.448 --> 56:51.951
And it's a lot harder to frost me
if they can't admit I exist.

56:54.370 --> 56:57.665
You draw too much attention to yourself.
Always have.

56:57.832 --> 57:00.794
I mean, sure, you play it mysterious...

57:00.960 --> 57:03.338
... but it's a noisy kind of mysterious.

57:03.505 --> 57:06.132
You, they have to kill.

57:06.299 --> 57:08.134
What is it you want, Oliver?

57:08.301 --> 57:10.345
A piece of him. The schoolboy.

57:11.679 --> 57:14.557
I always knew it would come down
to the two of you someday.

57:14.724 --> 57:16.851
The world's not big enough
for the both of you.

57:18.686 --> 57:20.772
Doesn't have to be a big piece.

57:20.939 --> 57:24.359
Just count me in, for old times' sake.

57:26.194 --> 57:28.363
Still hurts when it's cold.

57:28.530 --> 57:31.908
Lately, it's been cold a lot.

57:38.540 --> 57:41.543
Good. Now take him into a canter.

57:42.544 --> 57:43.545
No!

57:49.175 --> 57:51.553
Crime Alley.

58:00.478 --> 58:05.275
- You're not even close to fully recovered.
- Neither is he.

58:12.323 --> 58:16.911
He doesn't need a walking hospital bed
to keep his insides together.

58:19.998 --> 58:22.584
I know you're not looking forward
to your part in this.

58:22.750 --> 58:24.919
I can't say it will be pleasant.

58:25.086 --> 58:28.256
But it does fall within my duties.

58:35.346 --> 58:37.432
One hour.

58:37.599 --> 58:41.769
<i>Army troops have evacuated
the downtown slum known as Crime Alley.</i>

58:41.936 --> 58:45.356
<i>No explanation has been given,
and news coverage has been flatly...</i>

58:59.370 --> 59:01.956
Vehicle approaching from the west.
Something huge.

59:04.083 --> 59:06.211
Let it through. Then close the hole.

59:12.967 --> 59:16.137
He'll still be weak,
between the nuke and so little sunlight.

59:17.096 --> 59:20.642
Just how weak we'll see
when he finds my first surprise.

59:20.808 --> 59:25.063
Yeah, but how long you expect
to last against him?

59:25.230 --> 59:27.565
- Long enough.
- Boss.

59:27.732 --> 59:29.734
I'm trying to get the plan here.

59:30.401 --> 59:33.655
I mean, you gonna die tonight or what?

59:34.447 --> 59:36.449
Figure I will.

59:40.495 --> 59:42.288
I've got a visual. It's him.

59:42.455 --> 59:45.458
Do not engage. Just monitor his position.

59:45.625 --> 59:47.418
Wait, I lost him.

59:47.585 --> 59:50.838
Don't worry. He can't hide from what's coming.

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:55.320
Isn't this a school night, young lady?

01:00:55.486 --> 01:00:56.988
Clark.

01:01:00.199 --> 01:01:01.993
This is between you and me.

01:01:06.414 --> 01:01:10.084
- We don't have to do this.
- Sure we do.

01:01:16.466 --> 01:01:18.593
Bruce, be reasonable.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.178
You know what my orders are.

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:21.929
Your orders?

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.494
You say you answer
to some sort of authority.

01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:29.122
They only want me dead
because I'm an embarrassment.

01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:32.291
Because I do what they can't.

01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:34.001
What kind of authority is that?

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:44.303
It doesn't matter. It's their world,
and they won't stand for you anymore.

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:47.014
If it isn't me, it'll just be someone else.

01:02:47.932 --> 01:02:50.768
Really? Who do they send after you?

01:02:58.192 --> 01:03:00.862
We got the vehicle. Appears disabled.

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:03.531
- Unknown if anyone's inside.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

01:03:03.698 --> 01:03:05.867
<i>Approach with caution.</i>

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:56.978
Bruce, this is idiotic.

01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:12.577
That was three ribs, Bruce.

01:05:14.245 --> 01:05:15.580
Don't make me do this.

01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:24.130
<i>Robin. This is a recording.</i>

01:05:24.297 --> 01:05:26.966
<i>Clark should be too busy to listen now.
Here's the plan.</i>

01:05:34.098 --> 01:05:35.308
Anything good on?

01:05:38.352 --> 01:05:42.273
<i>What was that?
Who's up there? I want people on that roof.</i>

01:06:36.911 --> 01:06:38.371
Get ready.

01:06:46.337 --> 01:06:48.839
What are you doing?
Do you want me to kill you?

01:06:49.006 --> 01:06:51.092
Oh, you're not going to kill me.

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:52.259
Now.

01:06:58.766 --> 01:07:00.393
It wasn't easy to make, Clark.

01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:03.062
It took years and cost a fortune.

01:07:03.229 --> 01:07:05.564
Luckily, I had both.

01:07:06.107 --> 01:07:07.733
He's down here!

01:07:09.026 --> 01:07:10.695
Eyes downside, spud.

01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:12.530
Hi-ho freaking silver.

01:07:15.783 --> 01:07:17.952
You're feeling it now, aren't you?

01:07:18.119 --> 01:07:21.080
What the rest of us live with every day.

01:07:21.247 --> 01:07:22.790
Your own mortality.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:25.376
Don't worry, you'll survive.

01:07:25.793 --> 01:07:28.629
The kryptonite will work its way
out of your lungs soon enough.

01:07:32.466 --> 01:07:34.635
Bruce. Your heart.

01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:47.815
We got them. They got nowhere to go.

01:07:57.908 --> 01:08:00.494
But I didn't have to go easy on you.

01:08:00.661 --> 01:08:03.330
A different binding agent, a stronger mix.

01:08:03.497 --> 01:08:05.499
I want you to remember that.

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:08.002
I wanted to remind you
to stay out of my way.

01:08:08.169 --> 01:08:11.172
In all the years to come,
in your most private moments...

01:08:11.338 --> 01:08:15.509
... I want you to remember
the one man who beat you.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:22.183
Bruce.

01:08:49.752 --> 01:08:50.752
Don't touch him.

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:55.633
<i>Funeral proceedings are underway today
for Bruce Wayne...</i>

01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.054
<i>... as Gotham City still reels
from last week's spectacular revelation...</i>

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:03.640
<i>... that the world famous billionaire
was the Batman.</i>

01:09:03.808 --> 01:09:08.395
<i>All of Wayne's secrets, his methods
and tools in his decades as the Batman...</i>

01:09:08.562 --> 01:09:11.982
<i>... died with him
as Wayne Manor burned to the ground.</i>

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:14.734
<i>The fire was apparently set by his butler...</i>

01:09:14.902 --> 01:09:17.196
<i>... who himself died of a stroke at the scene.</i>

01:09:17.363 --> 01:09:19.073
<i>Every penny of Wayne's wealth...</i>

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.410
<i>... all of his accounts and financial holdings,
have also disappeared.</i>

01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:24.745
Amen.

01:09:35.089 --> 01:09:37.341
You've got some nerve showing up here.

01:09:37.508 --> 01:09:40.761
- I know who killed him, damn you...
- Selina.

01:09:40.928 --> 01:09:44.682
Don't. It's no use. Let's go.

01:09:46.934 --> 01:09:48.269
Were you a friend?

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:52.106
I think so. I honestly couldn't say.

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:54.775
Sounds about right.

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:40.321
- See that ledge? Get another lamp up there.
- Right, boss.

01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:43.782
- And, you, one there too.
- Cool, boss.

01:10:44.366 --> 01:10:46.160
There's a fresh spring under here.

01:10:46.327 --> 01:10:48.495
I want our water supply set up in one hour.

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:52.333
- We ain't got forever, people.
- Sure we do.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.357
Starting now,
I'm going to teach you everything.

01:11:16.523 --> 01:11:19.693
All of my ways. All of my secrets.

01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:22.780
You're going to be my army,
operating in the shadows...

01:11:22.947 --> 01:11:24.865
... keeping Gotham safe.

01:11:25.032 --> 01:11:28.494
And we're going to take
as long as we need.

01:11:28.661 --> 01:11:31.664
Now, do what Oliver says
and get to work.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:33.540
- Right, boss.
- You got it, boss.

01:11:33.707 --> 01:11:37.044
- Give me a hand here.
- Go. Come on, come on, come on.

01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:40.673
Heard the schoolboy found you out.

01:11:40.839 --> 01:11:43.384
It's all right.
I think the message got through.

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:46.887
As long as we stay quiet,
he'll leave us alone.

01:11:47.054 --> 01:11:51.558
- You gonna be all right with this?
- This quieter mysterious?

01:11:51.725 --> 01:11:55.104
I spent 10 years looking for a good death.

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:56.730
This...

01:11:58.524 --> 01:12:00.734
This'll be a good life.

01:12:26.468 --> 01:12:28.262
Good enough.
