Hey, guys,

00:19.987 --> 00:22.187
this is my little
brother, Mike.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.822
I'm surprised that people aren't
calling you by your nickname.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.157
(laughs)

00:25.159 --> 00:27.693
Skidmark.
(laughter)

00:27.695 --> 00:28.794
Our grandmother was dying

00:28.796 --> 00:30.129
and this guy went
on a kayaking trip.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.330
Good burn.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.998
Looks like we're even now.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.333
No, we're pretty far
from even, bud.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.367
Oh, my God.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.169
You know anything about,
uh, this?

00:37.171 --> 00:38.303
Burn.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.873
(chuckles wryly)

00:40.875 --> 00:42.574
CAROL: Tandy,
are you all right?

00:42.576 --> 00:45.177
'Cause I found
all this hair by the bed.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.378
I'm great.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.579
Oh, my.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.014
(chuckles)

00:49.016 --> 00:50.682
(gasps)

00:50.684 --> 00:53.152
Did you give yourself
a little haircut there?

00:53.154 --> 00:55.721
No, this is actually,
uh, Mike's work, I believe.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.356
Uh, am I right there, Mike?

00:57.358 --> 00:59.558
Oh, yeah, no, it sure is.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.394
Well, Mike,
I think you missed a spot.

01:04.764 --> 01:06.198
Oh, no, no, no, Carol,
I hit all the spots

01:06.200 --> 01:07.666
I was hoping to hit.

01:07.668 --> 01:08.834
See, you got business
on the right, there,

01:08.836 --> 01:10.235
and party on the left.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.937
Bet you think this
is a huge burn, huh?

01:11.939 --> 01:13.605
I think it's
a considerable burn, yes.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.908
Guess what? The burn's on you.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.343
Yeah, 'cause I friggin' love it.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.779
Yeah, I was going to actually
do this to myself at some point,

01:20.781 --> 01:22.948
so you just saved me
a bunch of time.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.616
So thank you.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.118
Oh, well, you're welcome, Phil.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.687
Tandy, were you really gonna
do this to yourself?

01:28.689 --> 01:31.523
Because it's wildly uneven.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.526
Yeah, it looks like you got
nuked right in the face.

01:34.528 --> 01:35.861
ERICA:
You look like

01:35.863 --> 01:37.896
two different serial killers.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.431
Yeah, you look like
you're from the future,

01:39.433 --> 01:41.066
and you're here
to warn us about technology.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.067
Give him a break, guys.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.202
You know, I-I-I kind of like it.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.303
Thank you Todd.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.704
And thank you, Mike.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.439
I mean, a-a-again,
absolutely love it.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.074
Major time saver.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.476
Well, I hope you were planning
on matching your carpet

01:50.478 --> 01:51.777
to your drapes,
'cause I went ahead

01:51.779 --> 01:53.011
and saved you some time
there as well.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.417
(laughs) Yeah, you did,
and yeah, I was.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.885
Another round of thanks.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.653
Another round
of you're welcomes.

02:04.257 --> 02:06.658
(laughter)

02:07.393 --> 02:09.561
(stressed sighing)

02:12.499 --> 02:14.199
Friggin' Mike.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.408
(groans)

02:23.410 --> 02:26.011
You know, now that
I'm used to it,

02:26.013 --> 02:28.981
it doesn't look
half bad. Boom.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.316
It's so fun to get
to say booms now.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.152
Hardy har har, Carol.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.954
If you don't like it,
you can just shave it off.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.157
Oh, and give Mike
the satisfaction?

02:38.159 --> 02:39.658
No way.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.160
I'm gonna give him
something else.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.861
A taste
of his own medicine.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.463
(scoffs) No.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.365
You two are even now.
What?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.800
You made him feel awful for
missing your grandma's death.

02:48.802 --> 02:52.371
This is just a classic
tit-for-tat situation.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.040
Your head's the tat,
and your grandma was the tit.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.476
God, Carol,
you're just like my parents.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.012
No matter what Mike did,
they always took his side.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.346
I'm on our side.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.781
Maybe you'd realize that if you

03:02.783 --> 03:05.384
just stopped focusing
on your tits.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.885
Carol, you got
to start listening

03:06.887 --> 03:08.120
to yourself when you talk.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.557
Hey.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.192
Hey, Sweet Cheeks.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.460
(laughter)

03:15.462 --> 03:18.697
I-I just stopped by
to say hi real quick.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.199
Oh, you're not gonna stay?

03:20.201 --> 03:22.301
I got a bunch
of stuff to do.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.203
I-I got to, you know,
clean out my desk,

03:24.205 --> 03:25.904
uh, (sighs) iron my socks.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.173
Todd, are you
going to see Melissa?

03:28.175 --> 03:30.008
Yeah.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.843
Okay, why didn't
you just say that?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.312
I should've.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.880
It's just...
I've-I've never had

03:34.882 --> 03:36.248
two girlfriends before.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.016
We're all adults here,

03:38.018 --> 03:39.851
and I think that we
should just make a promise

03:39.853 --> 03:42.187
that we're always gonna
be honest with each other.

03:42.189 --> 03:44.489
That sounds good
to me, okay.
(chuckles) Good.

03:44.491 --> 03:46.892
So when do you think
you'll be done with Melissa?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.360
Uh, ballparking it?
Uh-huh.

03:48.362 --> 03:49.728
Um, I get there around 6:00.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.163
We usually start a movie,

03:51.165 --> 03:52.731
then, uh, hop
underneath the covers.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.701
Uh, things, uh, uh, get
a little-little handsy.

03:55.703 --> 03:58.203
M-maybe some kissing, uh,

03:58.205 --> 04:00.772
and then she-she on top of me
for some light grinding,

04:00.774 --> 04:02.341
uh, maybe five minutes.

04:02.343 --> 04:05.277
Then, we, uh,
start taking our clothes off--

04:05.279 --> 04:06.778
you know that's quick--
two minutes.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.014
Uh, then, we, uh, have sex.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.849
You know, usually
missionary in nature...

04:10.851 --> 04:12.951
Okay, I think
I've got the picture.
Okay.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.953
We-we got this, right?
We got this.

04:14.955 --> 04:17.956
Okay, bye.
Okay, bye.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.926
TANDY:<i> Hey, Mike, hope you're</i>
<i>not allergic to poison oak,</i>

04:20.928 --> 04:23.795
'cause you're about
to be sleeping in it.

04:30.370 --> 04:33.138
Burn.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.551
(chuckles)

04:46.553 --> 04:48.587
Nice try,
you friggin' piece of crap.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.956
But you got to get up
a little earlier in the morning

04:50.958 --> 04:53.225
to put one over
on ole Tandycakes.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.249
What the hell is this?

05:17.251 --> 05:19.418
Who cares about money now?

05:19.420 --> 05:23.722
What a dummy.
(loud pop)

05:25.625 --> 05:27.893
He friggin' Smurfed me.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.167
(whining):
It's not coming off.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.536
It's not coming off.

05:37.538 --> 05:41.006
What do I do? What do I do?

05:42.375 --> 05:45.310
Bingo.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.779
CAROL:
<i>So there I am,</i>

05:47.781 --> 05:49.848
standing between
Denzel Washington's legs,

05:49.850 --> 05:52.317
and I'm saying,
"Push, Denzel, push."

05:52.319 --> 05:54.186
And Denzel pops out

05:54.188 --> 05:56.822
the most beautiful
little Siamese twins.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.790
They are perfect.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.525
And then he says, "Sally?"--

06:00.527 --> 06:02.194
'cause he's calling me Sally
for some reason--

06:02.196 --> 06:03.562
he says, "Sally,

06:03.564 --> 06:06.398
"you keep my attached babies.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.068
I got my movie career."

06:10.070 --> 06:12.237
And I have had
that dream 50 times,

06:12.239 --> 06:14.639
and I do not know what it means.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.742
Oh, that, that wasn't a dream,

06:16.744 --> 06:18.143
(imitating echo)
Sally... Sally... Sally...

06:18.145 --> 06:20.011
Oh, that's not funny.
I thought it...

06:20.013 --> 06:21.179
Good morning.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.582
I didn't mean
to scare you.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.023
Tandy, are you wearing makeup?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.259
(laughing): Oh, yeah,

06:34.261 --> 06:36.161
and I'm also wearing
a dress and heels, Gail.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.696
"Am I wearing makeup?"

06:37.698 --> 06:39.030
(laughing)
But seriously, though,

06:39.032 --> 06:40.265
everyone sleep well?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.433
Huh? Mike?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.435
Yeah, slept like a rock.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.170
Really? Hmm.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.772
I actually tried out this new,

06:46.774 --> 06:48.073
uh, house down the road here.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.608
Oh, you did, now?

06:49.610 --> 06:52.244
You did, now, huh.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.746
So, uh, bring that,
uh, sleeping bag with you?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.415
No. No, didn't need it.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.116
No, I slept in a bed
like a big boy.

06:58.118 --> 06:59.451
Huh.
Truth be told,

06:59.453 --> 07:02.120
it was sad being
so far away from you.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.055
Yeah, it made me real blue.

07:04.057 --> 07:07.592
I'm sure it did.
It did.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.261
So where is this new place?

07:09.263 --> 07:11.563
Local.

07:11.565 --> 07:15.133
(laughing) I'm gonna need
an exact address, bro.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.402
I mean, how am I gonna
get you your Christmas cards?

07:17.404 --> 07:19.304
Well, I'll have to show
it to you sometime.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.573
I'm<i> dying</i> to have you over.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.942
I'd like that.

07:23.944 --> 07:27.279
Really, it's like there's makeup
on top of blue ink.

07:27.281 --> 07:30.816
It's called a suntan,
guys, I mean... (laughs)

07:30.818 --> 07:33.418
You never seen
a suntan before?

07:33.420 --> 07:35.420
TODD:
<i>So, uh, Gail and I</i>

07:35.422 --> 07:37.989
had sex twice,
right before I came over.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.091
She had me trying out
some new maneuves,

07:40.093 --> 07:41.460
and we did that thing
where, uh, you hold

07:41.462 --> 07:43.829
the woman upside down
around the waist, uh...

07:43.831 --> 07:45.831
God, I know there's
a name for it... uh, it was...

07:45.833 --> 07:47.599
Todd, I don't... I don't
want to talk about that.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.468
Well, I-I just want
to be completely honest

07:49.470 --> 07:51.670
with you, hon, because,
uh, Gail said that

07:51.672 --> 07:53.271
that's the only way
that this is gonna work.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.106
Look, Todd, I already
only have you

07:55.108 --> 07:56.775
50% of the time,

07:56.777 --> 07:58.443
I don't want to spend that
time talking about Gail.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.479
No, yeah, no,
absolutely, you know,

08:00.481 --> 08:04.349
and you deserve 100%
of that 50%.

08:04.351 --> 08:07.352
Y... although, remember,
I do have to shave off

08:07.354 --> 08:09.788
a little slice
for Erica's baby.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.456
Y... d... say 20%.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.992
Uh, are you sure
you're not taking on

08:13.994 --> 08:15.527
more than you can handle?

08:15.529 --> 08:18.096
Uh, you-you can't be
all things to all people.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.632
Look, you are my priority.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.801
You're my number one.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.169
M-m-my co-number one.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.339
And-and-and you deserve,
you know,

08:27.341 --> 08:29.708
uh, exactly, uh,

08:29.710 --> 08:32.310
uh, b-between...

08:32.312 --> 08:34.913
40 and-and 50% of me.

08:36.048 --> 08:37.949
So romantic.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.072
Gotcha.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.911
TANDY:

Oh, yeah,

09:36.376 --> 09:38.677
home security system
I rigged up.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.712
Why would you need
something like that?

09:40.714 --> 09:43.348
No reason.

09:45.184 --> 09:46.851
See you got
your little suit on, huh?

uh, doing my neighborhood
watch program.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.462
Yeah, I'm actually
a block captain.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.897
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.599
Uh, just, uh,
sweeping the perimeter

10:00.601 --> 10:03.868
to make sure
everything's secure.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.770
Clear!

10:05.772 --> 10:08.073
See, it's funny,
'cause it kinda looks like

10:08.075 --> 10:10.575
you were gonna put
poison oak in my bed.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.044
(laughing)

10:15.081 --> 10:16.915
That's loco, man.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.483
You're friggin' paranoid.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.118
A friggin' block captain, uh,

10:20.120 --> 10:22.087
putting poison oak in your bed?

10:22.089 --> 10:23.655
Uh, that's the kind of stuff
I'm trying to stop, dude.

10:23.657 --> 10:24.823
Yeah.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.458
Wh-What's in the bag, then?

10:26.460 --> 10:28.560
You know, uh,

10:28.562 --> 10:31.663
just, uh, nothing, you know.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.498
See, I think that
it's poison oak.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.800
Well, then you're
a friggin' idiot,

10:35.802 --> 10:38.269
'cause this was gonna be
a housewarming gift for you.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.505
Hmm.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.607
I guess I'm a little confused.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.409
Why would
my older brother get me

10:44.411 --> 10:46.077
poison oak
as a housewarming gift?

10:46.079 --> 10:48.446
It's not poison oak, Mike!

10:48.448 --> 10:50.915
Why don't you look me
in the eyes and say that.

10:53.285 --> 10:55.820
It's not poison oak...

10:55.822 --> 10:57.689
Mike.

10:57.691 --> 11:00.992
Then why don't you go ahead
and rub it on your balls for me?

11:02.495 --> 11:03.728
Fine.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.868
You happy now?

11:09.870 --> 11:11.703
Outside the bag.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.972
Under the suit.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.674
Directly on your balls.

11:39.131 --> 11:41.566
I know it's poison oak,
Skidmark.

11:42.968 --> 11:44.202
I know it up here,

11:44.204 --> 11:46.538
and you know it.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.973
And I'm gonna
get you back.

12:04.256 --> 12:05.757
(screaming)

12:05.759 --> 12:08.259
(screaming gibberish)

12:26.779 --> 12:28.847
How dare you!

12:28.849 --> 12:31.683
Oh, relax, it's only
the fourth one.

12:31.685 --> 12:33.952
See?

12:36.255 --> 12:38.690
I can't believe you
just threw sand at me.

12:38.692 --> 12:40.024
I'm gonna have
to get you back for that one.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.427
Oh, you... (yells)

12:42.429 --> 12:45.263
Oh, I forgot,
I have something for you.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.534
You have some nerve!

12:49.536 --> 12:50.635
The fourth one.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.636
Here, eat sand.

12:51.638 --> 12:52.604
Still the fourth one.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.239
Mike! I didn't even

12:54.241 --> 12:56.875
hit you with the sand, man!

12:56.877 --> 12:59.878
Mike, you can't get me back
for something I didn't do!

12:59.880 --> 13:01.446
Come on, man!

13:01.448 --> 13:03.815
(sobbing)
I didn't do anything!

13:03.817 --> 13:05.150
Mike!

13:09.889 --> 13:11.489
TANDY:
<i>Mike, you in here?</i>

13:15.761 --> 13:17.929
Hey, Tandy.
(shrieks)

13:17.931 --> 13:19.597
I'm worried about you,
you're not looking good.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.466
He's too flippin' good, man.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.401
Friggin' guy is everywhere.

13:24.770 --> 13:27.071
I need your help, T.
I need your spirit.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.907
I can't.
I've crunched the numbers.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.176
It's a
mathematical impossibility.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.610
But I need you, bud.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.078
I need you so hard.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.181
And I want to be there
for you so hard,

13:36.183 --> 13:38.349
but I'm hanging on
by a thread, here.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.685
I've got two girlfriends;
something's got to give.

13:40.687 --> 13:41.953
(quietly):
You make me sick.

13:41.955 --> 13:42.954
No.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.190
I don't need your help.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.325
I can do this on my own.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.227
(snaps)
Get out of here.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.466
(clattering)

13:55.468 --> 13:56.935
Enough is enough.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.338
(shrieks)

14:00.340 --> 14:02.874
(gasps) Listen,
I'm here for you, buddy.

14:02.876 --> 14:04.375
What can I do to help?

14:09.014 --> 14:11.049
Mike.

14:12.051 --> 14:14.719
Have you met my friend, Todd?

14:18.390 --> 14:19.824
Mike.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.527
This is my house.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.329
This is my friend.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.463
This here Malibu

14:25.465 --> 14:28.166
is Tandy country.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.168
You been put on blast.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.837
Okay, this was just supposed
to be you and me goofing around.

14:32.839 --> 14:34.339
All right, now you're bringing
other people into it?

14:34.341 --> 14:35.974
I'm so sorry, Todd.

14:35.976 --> 14:39.310
You win. I'm out.

14:42.414 --> 14:44.749
Congratulations,
Tandy, it's over.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.251
You are so naive, Todd.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.186
It's not over.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.989
He just wants me to think it is
so I'll let my guard down.

14:52.157 --> 14:54.292
This is only the beginning.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.395
(loud popping)

14:57.397 --> 14:58.830
Whoa.

14:58.832 --> 15:01.165
Carol,
stop popping my alarm system.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.569
Okay, okay,
this has got to stop.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.739
This is like McDreamy
versus McSteamy redux.

15:07.741 --> 15:11.276
I'll stop when he stops,
and he will never stop, Carol.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.177
Hey, I want you
to see something.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.647
(popping continues)

15:20.552 --> 15:22.086
(chuckles)

15:22.088 --> 15:24.355
(sighs)

15:24.357 --> 15:25.723
Look at these two

15:25.725 --> 15:27.025
little boys.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.260
They love each other so much.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.362
I mean, yeah,
we had some good times.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.731
Hey, trust me,
you show him this stuff,

15:33.733 --> 15:35.733
it will turn on
his heart light.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.869
Family's everyone's weak spot.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.637
Hmm.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.539
You're right, it is.

15:45.911 --> 15:46.444
(sighs)

15:47.746 --> 15:50.148
What's wrong?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.550
I was reading this letter
that Mom and Dad wrote you

15:52.552 --> 15:53.851
while you were in space.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.387
It's really moving.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.822
What? Let me see it.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.558
I'd love to show
it to you, bud,

16:00.560 --> 16:01.926
but I'm gonna burn it.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.127
No, hey! Don't you dare!

16:03.129 --> 16:05.396
The pranks stop now.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.098
I-I already told you
I was stopping.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.334
Half of me really wants
to give it to you,

16:09.336 --> 16:11.336
but the other half
needs it for insurance.

16:13.839 --> 16:16.641
All right, I'm gonna go
put this in my hiding place,

16:16.643 --> 16:18.109
and don't bother looking for it,

16:18.111 --> 16:20.178
'cause you'll never find it.

16:22.681 --> 16:24.248
<i>(bubble wrap popping)</i>

16:24.250 --> 16:26.451
Bingo.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.687

16:29.689 --> 16:32.323
Now, let's take
a wild guess here.

(clears throat)

17:50.670 --> 17:52.670
Good evening.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.739
What in the name of G-O-D.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.108
Looks like Hitler's mustache
is sliding off your face.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.677
Yeah, you look like
a melon with a mold problem.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.512
It looks like the floor
of a barbershop

18:01.514 --> 18:03.414
took a dump on half your face.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.683
Well, take a good
long look at it,

18:05.685 --> 18:08.119
'cause this is who I am.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.420
My best friend's
having a meltdown?

18:09.422 --> 18:10.688
No problem.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.956
I shave half my hair, mustache,

18:11.958 --> 18:13.257
and mons pubis for him.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.428
Erica, you need me
to be your baby daddy?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.763
Done.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.965
Carol, you keep having
crazy baby dreams,

18:20.967 --> 18:23.868
obviously still upset
about Tandy's sterility.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.036
Well, I'm here for you.

18:25.038 --> 18:26.704
Just tell me what you need.

18:26.706 --> 18:30.108
'Cause I can give 100%
to every person

18:30.110 --> 18:33.377
on the face of the earth,
and still have 100%

18:33.379 --> 18:34.745
to give to you, Gail,

18:34.747 --> 18:36.080
and you, Melissa.

18:36.082 --> 18:37.448
Now-now I know that adds up

18:37.450 --> 18:39.584
to be about 600%,
but what can I say?

18:39.586 --> 18:42.153
I've never been good at math.

18:42.155 --> 18:45.723
Just about the only thing
I am good at...

18:45.725 --> 18:46.924
is Todd.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.293
Anybody has
any issues with that,

18:49.295 --> 18:51.329
there's the friggin' door.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.831
I mean, I'll get it for you.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.955
Yeah.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.758
And all that stuff
that I wrote in that letter--

19:20.760 --> 19:23.361
I got it from letters
they actually wrote to you.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.595
Hmm.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.098
Good to know.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.734

Here.

19:34.373 --> 19:37.108
(sighs)

19:37.110 --> 19:39.377
I mean, you were all

19:39.379 --> 19:42.046
that Mom and Dad
talked about.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.815
Even before
you went into space.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.218
I mean, they were
so proud of you.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.353
And, you know,

19:49.355 --> 19:51.989
I was always jealous
of that.

19:51.991 --> 19:54.058
You know they were
proud of you, too.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.027
Yeah, but it
was different.

19:56.029 --> 19:57.562
I was a temp.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.363
So what?
They didn't care about that.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.699
I cared about it.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.436
(sighs)

20:07.506 --> 20:09.640
I'm sorry.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.396
I miss them.

20:35.167 --> 20:39.070
I do, too.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.949
I swear to God I didn't know
we were gonna make up just now.

21:02.394 --> 21:03.728
Great speech.

21:03.730 --> 21:04.962
Thank you, Carol.

21:04.964 --> 21:07.398
Yeah, you know,
it got me thinking,

21:07.400 --> 21:10.034
maybe there is something
you can do for me.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.769
Anything, Carol.

21:11.771 --> 21:15.273
