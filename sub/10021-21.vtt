00:07.195 --> 00:08.389
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.597 --> 00:11.395
I guess a candle-lit dinner
wouldn't be enticing.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.295
You offer me cardiothoracic?

00:13.501 --> 00:16.094
Not officially until May.
But between us...

00:16.303 --> 00:19.762
- I'm covering the ER, all right?
- Fine, I'm finished here.

00:19.975 --> 00:21.943
Peter applied
for the trauma fellowship?

00:22.143 --> 00:23.303
Yeah, hadn't you heard?

00:23.511 --> 00:24.535
What do you think he'll do?

00:25.714 --> 00:27.011
He'll be on the first plane.

00:35.056 --> 00:37.081
Oh, my God! I'm really sorry.

00:37.292 --> 00:39.157
That's okay, it's part of the game.

00:39.361 --> 00:40.453
Being swatted by a ball?

00:40.662 --> 00:43.256
No, it's called a hindrance.
It's a do-over.

00:43.465 --> 00:44.796
So I don't get penalized?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.025
- No, I got in the way.
- Okay.

00:47.235 --> 00:48.327
So when do you go in?

00:48.536 --> 00:49.969
Noon. You?

00:50.171 --> 00:52.036
Depends. I may have a meeting.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.468
Oh, the trauma fellowship?

00:54.609 --> 00:56.873
- Maybe.
- That's not very nice.

00:58.847 --> 01:02.476
I mean, I don't know when, actually.
Romano keeps stalling.

01:02.684 --> 01:04.811
Don't worry.
You're more than qualified.

01:08.790 --> 01:12.453
I'm so sorry.
Why do you have to stand there?

01:12.661 --> 01:13.923
I've gotta stand somewhere.

01:14.129 --> 01:15.926
I didn't mean to hit you, honestly.

01:16.131 --> 01:17.496
Here, why don't you serve?

01:17.699 --> 01:19.098
Okay.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.466
You can't be enjoying this very much.

01:21.670 --> 01:23.069
The ball has to bounce first.

01:23.538 --> 01:24.903
Right!

01:28.076 --> 01:29.134
Bollocks!

01:30.211 --> 01:32.475
Blood pressure's fine.
How are you feeling?

01:32.681 --> 01:33.739
A lot better.

01:33.949 --> 01:36.543
That happens once you reach
your second trimester.

01:36.751 --> 01:38.480
I didn't gain weight in the first one.

01:38.687 --> 01:41.417
All of a sudden I've put
on two pounds in one week?

01:41.623 --> 01:42.954
Get used to it.

01:43.158 --> 01:45.126
I'll have Alice schedule
your ultrasound.

01:45.327 --> 01:46.624
Want to know your baby's sex?

01:47.395 --> 01:48.657
I haven't decided yet.

01:48.863 --> 01:50.524
Just tell me before we start.

01:50.732 --> 01:54.133
And we'll get an alpha-fetoprotein,
a spina bifida indicator.

01:54.336 --> 01:56.770
- And Down's syndrome.
- Right.

01:56.972 --> 01:58.098
You think I'm at risk?

01:58.306 --> 02:02.003
No, AFP standard.
We only do amnio when you're over 35.

02:02.210 --> 02:04.041
Unless there are genetic disorders.

02:04.245 --> 02:05.269
No.

02:05.480 --> 02:06.970
Cystic fibrosis? Tay-Sachs?

02:07.182 --> 02:09.877
- No.
- What about the father's side?

02:10.085 --> 02:10.983
I don't think so.

02:11.186 --> 02:13.120
Well, you should check on that.

02:13.321 --> 02:16.484
But everything looks fine.
Very healthy pregnancy.

<i>Dr. Ross, leave a message.</i>

03:23.324 --> 03:25.690
Hey, Doug, it's me.

03:26.294 --> 03:29.058
I know we said
we shouldn't call for a while.

03:29.264 --> 03:32.756
But I needed to tell you something.

03:32.967 --> 03:34.867
I faxed it.

03:38.339 --> 03:43.333
I really want you to read it
and sit with it for a while.

03:45.647 --> 03:48.377
And then we'll talk about it.

03:50.318 --> 03:51.717
Okay.

03:55.156 --> 03:56.453
Okay.

03:57.559 --> 03:58.651
Bye.

04:01.663 --> 04:05.463
<i>Semper fi,</i> do or die.
Die for my brother.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.430
I said die for my brother.

04:07.635 --> 04:10.468
Two mgs of Ativan for the Duke,
and a banana bag.

04:10.672 --> 04:13.163
- You have a rule-out triple A?
- Yeah, Exam Four.

04:13.374 --> 04:15.467
Sorry I had to cancel the meeting...

04:15.677 --> 04:17.007
I'm one of a few good men.

04:17.212 --> 04:18.803
That's good. Get a job.

04:19.012 --> 04:20.002
Sorry I had to cancel the meeting.

04:20.214 --> 04:22.809
I had a perfed appy.
But I'll have it rescheduled.

04:23.017 --> 04:24.006
I spoke to Anspaugh.

04:24.219 --> 04:26.414
He'll come back
after his seminar at 10:00.

04:26.621 --> 04:28.486
It's a little past my bedtime.

04:28.690 --> 04:31.716
He said you could present
your top three candidates...

04:31.926 --> 04:33.723
...and I'll pass them along.

04:34.362 --> 04:37.263
- I bet you would.
- I'm trying to prevent further delay.

04:37.465 --> 04:38.932
Very conscientious of you.

04:39.134 --> 04:40.192
- Thank you.
- I'll be there.

04:40.401 --> 04:41.390
I appreciate that.

04:41.603 --> 04:43.935
IKerry, you mind if I call you IKerry?

04:44.139 --> 04:45.071
Certainly, Robert.

04:45.273 --> 04:47.605
- Here, thank you.
- Hey, doc?

04:47.809 --> 04:50.539
I know how much this little
project means to you.

04:50.745 --> 04:51.803
Actually, I don't.

04:52.013 --> 04:55.346
But you would be smart
not to raid my surgical staff.

04:55.550 --> 04:59.008
If you're referring to Peter
and Elizabeth, they came to me.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.209
Send them right back.

05:00.421 --> 05:01.911
I didn't realize you owned them.

05:02.123 --> 05:05.286
Well, now you do.
Hire some hump from the outside.

05:05.493 --> 05:07.222
Make life a lot easier.

05:07.428 --> 05:09.862
- You want to see a picture?
- No need for that.

05:10.064 --> 05:11.258
That would turn her off.

05:11.466 --> 05:13.866
I don't need to be fixed up.
I'm not pathetic.

05:14.068 --> 05:15.695
- Who is?
- He won't meet my friend.

05:15.904 --> 05:17.633
You met her,
the urology nurse, Gina?

05:17.839 --> 05:19.602
- She's nice.
- What's the matter?

05:19.807 --> 05:22.173
Are you afraid she's
touched too many...?

05:22.377 --> 05:24.072
Facial and abdominal trauma coming.

05:24.279 --> 05:25.769
Little League umpire got beat up.

05:25.980 --> 05:28.778
- One too many bad calls, I guess.
- I guess.

05:28.983 --> 05:31.213
What is this country coming to?
Little League?

05:31.419 --> 05:33.444
See what happened to the
scoutmaster I treated?

05:33.655 --> 05:34.679
Come on, meet her.

05:34.889 --> 05:36.880
- I don't date nurses.
- Just med students?

05:37.091 --> 05:39.355
No, I keep my love life
out of the workplace.

05:39.561 --> 05:41.529
- Since when?
- Woman freaking out in Two.

05:41.729 --> 05:43.993
- Something alive in her ear.
- Carter.

05:44.199 --> 05:46.667
Page Surgery.
I'll meet the umpire outside.

05:47.735 --> 05:49.760
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- What?

05:49.971 --> 05:50.869
You don't look so good.

05:51.072 --> 05:53.131
I'm just tired.
I worked the night shift.

05:53.341 --> 05:54.535
Slept during the day?

05:54.742 --> 05:57.472
Yeah, a little. But I'm fine.

05:57.679 --> 05:58.839
What the hell is that?

05:59.047 --> 06:00.844
It's cool, huh? Sound-activated.

06:01.049 --> 06:03.017
I picked it up
at Grossman's Flea Market.

06:03.218 --> 06:07.177
- Wasn't the Macarena in two years ago?
- Three. I did it at my graduation.

06:07.388 --> 06:10.380
- Really? Why don't you show us?
- In your dreams.

06:10.592 --> 06:12.719
My friend knows
how to do the Macarena.

06:15.196 --> 06:16.220
Did you bruise?

06:16.431 --> 06:19.059
No, I don't think so.
I'm afraid to check.

06:19.267 --> 06:20.700
I'm sure you'll live.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.496
I didn't realize racquetball
was a contact sport.

06:23.705 --> 06:25.366
Well, I guess it's not my thing.

06:25.573 --> 06:27.302
Looked like you were
having fun there.

06:27.508 --> 06:30.705
Yeah, I was. It was a bit bizarre
bumping into Peter.

06:30.912 --> 06:33.244
- How so?
- You weren't uncomfortable?

06:33.448 --> 06:35.313
No, should I have been?

06:36.284 --> 06:37.512
This isn't our umpire.

06:37.719 --> 06:38.811
- You a doctor?
- Yeah.

06:39.020 --> 06:41.853
Lance Carmichael, FBI.
We've got a woman that's shot.

06:42.056 --> 06:43.045
What happened?

06:43.258 --> 06:45.658
Gunshot to the torso,
trouble breathing.

06:45.860 --> 06:47.521
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

06:47.729 --> 06:49.219
- Can't tell you that.
- Excuse me?

06:49.430 --> 06:51.990
Active operation,
we had to abort protocol.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.998
- What?
- Officially, we're not here.

06:57.305 --> 07:01.002
Resps are labored, pulse 130.
I'll get a gurney.

07:01.209 --> 07:03.006
Ma'am, can you tell me your name?

07:03.211 --> 07:05.179
Sorry, that's
confidential information.

07:05.380 --> 07:07.405
I'm trying to assess
her consciousness.

07:07.615 --> 07:08.639
Amber.

07:08.850 --> 07:11.341
Amber, why don't you
tell me how it happened?

07:11.552 --> 07:13.577
- Also confidential.
- You want me to help?

07:13.788 --> 07:15.722
Strictly need-to-know information.

07:15.923 --> 07:18.585
Amber, can you tell me
where you got hit?

07:18.793 --> 07:22.559
It felt like my chest,
but it hurts on the side.

07:22.997 --> 07:25.591
- How long ago?
- Eighteen and a half minutes.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.427
- What's your name?
- Dr. Greene.

07:27.635 --> 07:29.626
- Social security number?
- What?

07:30.038 --> 07:31.767
Gotta run a check.

07:31.973 --> 07:34.134
Get it out! Just get it out!

07:34.342 --> 07:37.334
Ma'am, you're gonna
have to hold still.

07:37.545 --> 07:40.878
What is it? What is it?

07:41.082 --> 07:43.346
I can still feel it moving around.

07:43.551 --> 07:46.349
I irrigated with lidocaine.
It should be dead.

07:46.554 --> 07:49.546
What? What should be dead?

07:52.560 --> 07:54.494
Looks like a cockroach.

07:55.029 --> 07:57.725
Ma'am, I can get it out.
I can get it out.

07:57.932 --> 08:00.059
- Oh!
- I can get it out.

08:00.268 --> 08:04.637
If you'll just hold still...
I don't want to puncture your eardrum.

08:05.640 --> 08:07.801
- I'm suing the bastard.
- Who's that, ma'am?

08:08.009 --> 08:10.068
My landlord.
I complained three times.

08:10.278 --> 08:12.803
I take a nap and wake up
with one in my ear!

08:13.014 --> 08:15.642
I'm gonna take him for
everything he has!

08:16.751 --> 08:20.517
Until then, I'd sleep with earplugs.

08:21.689 --> 08:23.247
I got it.

08:31.532 --> 08:32.520
All right.

08:32.734 --> 08:34.634
We'll get that cleaned up.

08:35.269 --> 08:38.432
You just sit still,
and I'll be right back.

08:42.409 --> 08:44.605
<i>Semper fi,</i> do or die!

08:44.812 --> 08:46.609
Lydia, can I get an angiocath?

08:46.814 --> 08:47.974
- Sure.
- And some Valium?

08:48.182 --> 08:49.672
- You got a headache?
- I'm fine.

08:49.884 --> 08:53.081
We need a secured area,
but more than one exit.

08:53.287 --> 08:55.482
- Is Trauma One open?
- Yeah, what do you got?

08:55.690 --> 08:57.885
Gunshot to the chest.
Possible pneumothorax.

08:58.092 --> 08:59.218
Metal slowed the bullet down.

08:59.427 --> 09:00.985
- Talk about a Wonderbra.
- It saved her?

09:01.195 --> 09:02.822
- Do you need them?
- They help.

09:03.030 --> 09:04.190
Essential personnel only.

09:04.399 --> 09:07.334
- What's this?
- FBI, it's all very cloak-and-dagger.

09:07.535 --> 09:09.662
I'm looking for a few good men here!

09:09.871 --> 09:12.738
- We gotta stay away from this patient.
- I am. Mark?

09:12.940 --> 09:14.805
Elizabeth and I can take it from here.

09:15.009 --> 09:16.874
We're gonna need some nurses.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.414
Whoa, relax, okay?
This happens all the time.

09:21.616 --> 09:23.584
I think I upset the apple cart.

09:23.985 --> 09:25.111
Get this guy out of here.

09:25.319 --> 09:27.981
<i>Semper fi,</i> do or die!

09:28.189 --> 09:29.349
Hey, Peter, what's this?

09:29.557 --> 09:31.149
Bowel obstruction.

09:31.359 --> 09:33.156
Tedious, huh? Well, don't worry.

09:33.361 --> 09:36.455
Soon you'll be
into the seat of the soul.

09:36.664 --> 09:37.790
Excuse me?

09:37.999 --> 09:39.557
The heart, Peter.

09:39.767 --> 09:42.201
You are serious about
the fellowship, right?

09:42.403 --> 09:43.700
- Yeah.
- Good, because I can't...

09:43.905 --> 09:46.032
...fight for you
and have you not take it.

09:46.707 --> 09:49.005
I thought you weren't making
a decision for weeks.

09:49.210 --> 09:51.178
We're not.
But the posturing's started.

09:51.379 --> 09:54.871
Besides, I don't want my guy
going off to waste his talent...

09:55.082 --> 09:57.209
...as some glorified ER doc.

09:57.418 --> 09:59.784
Well, I wouldn't exactly
consider it a waste.

10:02.557 --> 10:04.889
I know you're confused
with your son and all...

10:05.092 --> 10:08.255
...and we can be flexible about
that. But let's get real.

10:08.763 --> 10:11.027
You've worked too hard to settle...

10:11.232 --> 10:14.690
...for patching up drunk drivers
for the rest of your career.

10:14.902 --> 10:16.893
That's one way of looking at it.

10:17.104 --> 10:18.696
Good, so, I need to know.

10:20.141 --> 10:21.233
You my guy?

10:22.977 --> 10:26.037
If you're asking if I'm
interested in cardiothoracic, yeah.

10:26.314 --> 10:28.782
All right. Say no more.

10:31.652 --> 10:35.019
- Pressure's good, 130/80.
- Going to make a small incision.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.556
Will there be a scar?

10:37.758 --> 10:40.192
We'll hide this one under your arm.

10:41.028 --> 10:44.156
Oozing at the point of entry.
Apply pressure dressing.

10:44.365 --> 10:46.833
Curved IKelly.
Push another two of Versed.

10:47.034 --> 10:48.331
Easy on the painkillers.

10:48.536 --> 10:51.061
- She's been shot.
- She needs to stay clear-headed.

10:51.272 --> 10:53.763
I promise I won't listen to
anything she utters.

10:53.975 --> 10:55.567
- I got some fluid here.
- Blood?

10:55.776 --> 10:57.835
- Nothing in the chest cavity.
- I don't know.

10:58.045 --> 11:00.013
- Looks like saline.
- Do you have implants?

11:00.948 --> 11:03.576
- You popped my boob?
- The bullet did.

11:03.784 --> 11:06.753
- The implant might have helped...
- This area's off-limits.

11:06.954 --> 11:08.080
We need Merocel sponges.

11:08.289 --> 11:09.278
Get them someplace else.

11:09.490 --> 11:12.516
- I got to stop this nosebleed.
- Doesn't sound serious.

11:12.727 --> 11:13.989
- Are you a doctor?
- No.

11:14.195 --> 11:15.594
Thora-Seal, I'll connect the tube.

11:15.796 --> 11:17.161
Thanks.

11:17.698 --> 11:19.029
Hold it.

11:20.134 --> 11:21.123
And relax.

11:21.335 --> 11:23.360
- Did you just shoot that?
- What?

11:23.704 --> 11:26.264
- Did you just shoot that x-ray?
- Yeah.

11:26.474 --> 11:28.874
- I was in the room!
- I said "shooting."

11:29.076 --> 11:31.101
- What's wrong with you?
- What's happening?

11:31.312 --> 11:33.337
He took an x-ray
while I was in the room.

11:33.948 --> 11:36.508
Hey, Carol, it's okay.
We've all been exposed.

11:36.717 --> 11:39.447
I can't! You have to be more careful.

11:45.793 --> 11:48.694
She's very lucky.
No vital organ damage.

11:48.896 --> 11:50.363
When can we move her?

11:50.565 --> 11:52.362
We'll get her a bed upstairs.

11:52.567 --> 11:56.094
We need to move her to another
facility, one we can control.

11:56.304 --> 11:59.967
I need to monitor her for a few hours
before you can transport her.

12:00.174 --> 12:01.198
Are you done with that?

12:01.409 --> 12:02.706
- For now.
- I'll take it.

12:02.910 --> 12:06.402
And we'll need all original
documentation of any kind.

12:06.614 --> 12:09.845
Okay, the hospital keeps charts
even on Jane Does.

12:10.051 --> 12:11.541
We can't allow that.

12:11.752 --> 12:15.347
Let me guess,
this conversation never happened?

12:16.057 --> 12:17.524
Crit's 44, looks good.

12:17.725 --> 12:18.885
I'll take that.

12:23.064 --> 12:24.224
How are we gonna bill this?

12:24.432 --> 12:26.457
The bureau will be in touch.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.294
I have to call my chief of staff.

12:28.502 --> 12:30.970
We need the room.
Multiple MVAs coming in.

12:31.172 --> 12:34.073
- All right, let's go.
- Wait, what are you doing?

12:34.275 --> 12:37.142
Traffic accident coming in.
We'll move her to another room.

12:37.345 --> 12:38.334
Put them someplace else.

12:38.546 --> 12:39.706
This room is for trauma.

12:39.914 --> 12:41.905
This is a national security matter.

12:42.116 --> 12:44.516
I don't have time
to argue with you guys.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.581
- Who is she?
- I don't know.

12:47.788 --> 12:49.619
- What did she look like?
- A stripper.

12:49.824 --> 12:51.553
I'm guessing witness protection.

12:51.759 --> 12:54.193
A stripper, that's a way
to keep a low profile.

12:54.395 --> 12:56.056
Could be an undercover agent.

12:56.263 --> 12:57.662
She don't look like the type.

12:57.865 --> 13:00.698
- Isn't that the point?
- I'm guessing mobster's girlfriend.

13:00.901 --> 13:02.630
- Or a politician's.
- Maybe both.

13:02.837 --> 13:04.828
Got a Medevac coming.
Boating accident.

13:05.039 --> 13:06.233
- ETA?
- Five minutes.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.101
It's gonna be a long night.

13:08.309 --> 13:10.573
Mark, can you take these?
Medevac coming in.

13:10.778 --> 13:11.938
- Let's go.
- What do we got?

13:12.146 --> 13:14.137
Peter, you're with me, come on.

13:16.050 --> 13:17.517
You look like you're better.

13:17.718 --> 13:19.083
Got my second wind.

13:20.454 --> 13:23.753
Shannon Mitchell, 16 years old.
Front seat, ejected from the car.

13:23.958 --> 13:26.222
No seat belt, back pain.
Can't move her legs.

13:26.427 --> 13:27.416
Is her airway clear?

13:27.628 --> 13:30.096
Yeah, BP is 130 over 85, pulse 90.

13:30.297 --> 13:32.288
- My name's Elizabeth. Yours?
- Shannon.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.094
I want you to press your foot
against my hand...

13:35.302 --> 13:37.463
...just like you're stepping
on the gas.

13:37.672 --> 13:41.301
- I can't!
- Possible spinal cord injury, careful.

13:41.509 --> 13:42.533
On their way to the prom.

13:42.743 --> 13:44.904
Hit a telephone pole.
Restrained driver.

13:45.112 --> 13:47.512
Third-degree burns
to the hands and forearms.

13:47.715 --> 13:51.276
Pulled his friend out after
the tank exploded. Has chest pains.

13:51.485 --> 13:52.884
Where's Travis, did he make it?

13:53.087 --> 13:54.076
We got partial thickness.

13:54.288 --> 13:56.153
Ten mgs of morphine. How's his buddy?

13:56.357 --> 13:58.348
Carter? Carter!

14:00.461 --> 14:01.450
Oh, God!

14:01.662 --> 14:03.562
Travis Mitchell,
18-year-old passenger.

14:03.764 --> 14:05.391
Injury left him unconscious...

14:05.599 --> 14:09.330
...and his friend got him out.
Seventy-five percent area burned.

14:09.537 --> 14:10.731
We gave him saline en route.

14:10.938 --> 14:12.906
- His pressure?
- 94 over 68, pulse 130.

14:13.107 --> 14:14.131
Did you find Melissa?

14:14.341 --> 14:15.865
He's waking up, asking questions.

14:16.077 --> 14:18.204
Travis, my name is Dr. Carter.

14:18.412 --> 14:20.573
Are you having any trouble breathing?

14:20.781 --> 14:21.907
- Melissa?
- Who's Melissa?

14:22.116 --> 14:23.913
My girlfriend.
She was in the back seat.

14:24.118 --> 14:25.016
- Did she make it?
- Don't know.

14:25.219 --> 14:27.915
There were 3 victims.
They hadn't cleared the car.

14:31.726 --> 14:34.695
- I'll take the airway. Peter!
- What do we got?

14:34.895 --> 14:37.386
Andrea Brodoff, 34-year-old female.

14:37.598 --> 14:40.795
Rammed boat into a dock
with an attack of nausea.

14:41.001 --> 14:42.491
Be careful, I have AIDS.

14:42.703 --> 14:44.000
Penetrating abdominal injury.

14:44.205 --> 14:45.570
What's her pressure?

14:45.773 --> 14:48.537
95 over 60
after 800 cc's saline.

14:48.743 --> 14:50.404
- What's this?
- Fishing pole.

14:50.611 --> 14:51.908
We cut it off to transport.

14:52.113 --> 14:53.944
- Does it hurt on this side?
- Yes!

14:54.148 --> 14:56.173
- Who's this?
- This is Bruce, he's fine.

14:56.383 --> 14:58.476
Mom wouldn't take off without him.

14:58.686 --> 14:59.948
- Let's go!
- Taking Bruce?

15:00.154 --> 15:01.587
- I'll take him.
- So long.

15:01.789 --> 15:03.814
Come on, sweetie.

15:05.192 --> 15:06.284
Solu-Medrol's on board.

15:06.494 --> 15:08.689
- Shannon, can you lift your leg?
- No.

15:08.896 --> 15:09.885
How about your knee?

15:10.097 --> 15:12.258
Oh, my God! What's happening?

15:14.902 --> 15:17.166
- Babinski is positive.
- Is that bad?

15:17.371 --> 15:19.896
Push against
my hand with your big toe.

15:22.476 --> 15:23.943
All right, very good.

15:24.478 --> 15:26.571
- Where's X-ray?
- Coming.

15:26.781 --> 15:29.181
I'm gonna test the area
around your rectum.

15:29.383 --> 15:30.645
It might be uncomfortable.

15:30.851 --> 15:32.341
I won't be paralyzed, will I?

15:32.553 --> 15:35.522
Let's not worry about that.
I need you to focus now.

15:35.723 --> 15:37.918
- Dr. Greene, Carter needs you.
- What is it?

15:38.125 --> 15:39.922
- Burn victim.
- Is that my brother?

15:40.127 --> 15:42.061
- Who?
- The burn victim, is that Travis?

15:42.263 --> 15:44.823
Relax, Shannon.
We're doing everything we can.

15:45.032 --> 15:46.693
I'll be right back.

15:48.769 --> 15:51.135
Four units, ABG
and carboxyhemoglobin.

15:51.338 --> 15:52.737
What do you got, Carter?

15:52.940 --> 15:54.430
Near full-thickness burns.

15:54.642 --> 15:56.269
Maybe 80 percent.

15:56.877 --> 16:01.712
At 190 pounds, I'm calculating 1700
cc's of lactated Ringer's per hour.

16:01.916 --> 16:02.905
Sounds right.

16:03.117 --> 16:04.311
All right, Lydia, go ahead.

16:04.518 --> 16:05.849
How about vascular exam?

16:06.053 --> 16:08.214
Good peripheral pulses so far.

16:08.422 --> 16:12.222
Lucy, what do we do
to prevent constricting edema?

16:12.426 --> 16:16.419
Elevate the limbs
and do range-of-motion exercises.

16:16.630 --> 16:19.463
That's right.
Why don't you start on the left leg?

16:19.667 --> 16:22.158
- Is that my sister over there?
- Yeah.

16:22.369 --> 16:23.358
What's wrong with her?

16:23.571 --> 16:25.061
We don't know, she was ejected.

16:25.272 --> 16:26.432
Is she gonna be all right?

16:26.640 --> 16:28.267
She asked the same thing about you.

16:28.475 --> 16:30.875
Now, really move it, Lucy.
He can't feel it.

16:31.745 --> 16:34.179
- How's that d Ábridement?
- It'll take a while.

16:34.381 --> 16:37.373
BP is 95 over 65.

16:37.585 --> 16:40.213
All right, good bowel sounds.
Get me an ultrasound.

16:40.421 --> 16:43.413
I'll be right back.
Lucy, why don't you come with me?

16:44.024 --> 16:45.616
Yeah, go, I got this.

16:49.964 --> 16:52.432
- Find the parents.
- What should I tell them?

16:52.633 --> 16:54.931
That their kids
were in a serious accident.

16:55.135 --> 16:57.103
- Don't get into specifics.
- Okay.

16:57.304 --> 17:01.798
Burns can be pretty brutal.
It's okay to bow out your first time.

17:02.009 --> 17:03.033
Does he have a chance?

17:03.244 --> 17:04.233
There's always a chance.

17:04.444 --> 17:06.709
- Have you seen one this bad survive?
- No.

17:06.914 --> 17:11.442
We can't control this environment.
Transport's coming, please clear her.

17:11.652 --> 17:13.643
She has a tube.
She needs to be observed.

17:13.854 --> 17:15.845
You provided a valuable service.

17:16.056 --> 17:19.116
We appreciate it.
We've arranged for ongoing care.

17:19.326 --> 17:21.521
I don't know what to say.
She may need surgery.

17:21.729 --> 17:24.492
I'm not gonna release her
until she's stable.

17:24.698 --> 17:26.325
That's our problem.

17:26.532 --> 17:28.523
Dr. Greene, you got a sec?

17:28.736 --> 17:30.704
Hold on, I'll check her in a minute.

17:30.905 --> 17:32.634
I need a blood-alcohol level on them.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.330
Especially this one, he drove.

17:34.541 --> 17:35.599
He pulled his friend out.

17:35.809 --> 17:37.743
He also rammed the car into a pole.

17:37.945 --> 17:39.139
It's early. They're drunk?

17:39.346 --> 17:42.281
They came from a preparty.
Some parents served beer.

17:42.483 --> 17:45.452
Jeez, all right.
How's the fourth one?

17:45.653 --> 17:47.211
Haven't found her yet.

17:49.690 --> 17:51.157
You okay, Carol?

17:51.358 --> 17:54.088
<i>Semper fi,</i> you do or die.

17:54.295 --> 17:56.889
I die for my brother. I die...

17:58.132 --> 17:59.759
Central line kit's here.

17:59.967 --> 18:02.663
I got really sick.
I hit the throttle too hard.

18:02.870 --> 18:05.805
Let's get some O-neg
in case her pressure drops.

18:06.006 --> 18:08.133
- Where's Bruce?
- Ma'am, stay still, okay?

18:08.342 --> 18:09.604
He's in the lounge.

18:09.810 --> 18:13.007
Blood in Morison's pouch.
Might have nicked her liver.

18:13.213 --> 18:17.149
Let's get a gram of cefotetan,
and draw up preop labs.

18:17.351 --> 18:20.184
It's the medication.
I can't keep anything down.

18:20.387 --> 18:23.481
And the CMV just makes it worse.

18:23.691 --> 18:25.921
- You have CMV?
- Yeah.

18:26.126 --> 18:28.253
Call the O.R.,
tell them we're on our way.

18:28.462 --> 18:30.293
- Oh, God!
- What's wrong?

18:31.031 --> 18:33.261
She's vomiting! Roll her, roll her!

18:33.467 --> 18:34.661
Okay, okay.

18:36.236 --> 18:37.567
Carol!

18:38.872 --> 18:42.968
Die for your brother.
Die for your brother.

18:43.177 --> 18:46.146
It's limited to L-1.
I don't see any other involvement.

18:46.347 --> 18:47.371
How are we doing?

18:47.581 --> 18:51.415
She has sensation in the perianal
area and sphincter contraction.

18:51.618 --> 18:54.416
Cord lesion with fracture
of the first lumbar vertebra.

18:54.621 --> 18:56.851
A small fragment
impinging on her spinal cord.

18:57.057 --> 18:58.115
Give her steroids?

18:58.325 --> 19:01.294
Fifteen-hundred mgs
bolus IV Solu-Medrol.

19:01.495 --> 19:02.792
You'll take her to surgery?

19:02.997 --> 19:05.192
If we can decompress it,
she has a chance.

19:05.399 --> 19:07.026
Let's do it. Mother sign a consent?

19:07.234 --> 19:08.633
She's not here. I'll sign it.

19:08.836 --> 19:09.825
Okay, let's go.

19:10.037 --> 19:12.528
If she doesn't feel anything
in a day, she won't.

19:12.740 --> 19:14.571
Dr. Greene?
I think I sorted this out.

19:14.775 --> 19:17.175
The driver's date is
the spinal-cord injury.

19:17.378 --> 19:18.640
Her brother is the burn victim.

19:18.846 --> 19:21.440
And there's a fourth victim
no one can find.

19:22.049 --> 19:23.744
The driver's parents are coming.

19:23.951 --> 19:26.647
I spoke to neighbors
staying at the sibling's house.

19:26.854 --> 19:30.415
Their parents are in Milwaukee.
I have a call into their hotel.

19:30.624 --> 19:34.060
Okay, good.
Carter, how are we doing?

19:34.261 --> 19:36.491
Compromised circulation,
legs are cyanotic...

19:36.697 --> 19:39.063
...Iosing his pulse.
Prep for an escharotomy.

19:39.266 --> 19:41.734
- Okay, go ahead.
- Ten blade.

19:41.935 --> 19:43.266
What's happening?

19:43.470 --> 19:47.270
Well, the swelling is constricting
your blood supply.

19:47.474 --> 19:50.500
We need to make an incision
in the skin to release it.

19:50.711 --> 19:51.973
You're slicing my skin open?

19:52.179 --> 19:55.080
Don't worry, you're not gonna
feel a thing, okay?

19:55.282 --> 19:58.877
Lucy, why don't you go
talk him through it?

20:03.290 --> 20:06.054
All the way down to the sub-Q fat.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.108
- Did he start?
- See? It doesn't hurt.

20:23.110 --> 20:25.510
Will they be able to sew this back?

20:26.213 --> 20:27.407
We would do a skin graft.

20:28.782 --> 20:31.216
- You would or you will?
- We will.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.654
I got the medial aspect.

20:35.856 --> 20:40.657
Carry one centimeter proximal and
distal to the circumferential burn.

20:42.429 --> 20:45.523
- Did you find Melissa?
- Not yet.

20:49.870 --> 20:52.361
We're supposed to be
at the prom right now...

20:54.041 --> 20:55.269
...dancing.

20:56.410 --> 20:57.900
Was there a theme at your prom?

20:58.612 --> 21:00.671
Yeah, '40s.

21:01.281 --> 21:03.579
I was gonna wear a zoot suit,
but Melissa...

21:03.784 --> 21:06.252
...she wanted a tux.

21:09.890 --> 21:12.222
- Okay, that's one.
- Halfway there.

21:17.931 --> 21:20.957
Dr. Greene? FBI's looking for you.

21:21.168 --> 21:22.499
- They'll wait.
- Dr. Greene?

21:23.137 --> 21:24.604
- Yeah.
- Todd Hoffman, FBI.

21:24.805 --> 21:27.433
Did you treat a gunshot wound
to the chest?

21:27.641 --> 21:30.940
I told your other guys
that she's not ready to transport.

21:31.145 --> 21:34.046
- What other guys?
- Right in here.

21:35.649 --> 21:38.049
They were anxious
to get her out of here.

21:39.219 --> 21:40.880
I bet they were.

21:44.958 --> 21:46.516
And you believed them?

21:46.727 --> 21:49.025
They flashed a badge
just like you did.

21:49.229 --> 21:50.958
Why didn't you put out an APB?

21:51.165 --> 21:53.963
- I'll need all medical reports.
- They took everything.

21:54.168 --> 21:56.068
- Everything?
- Who are these guys?

21:56.270 --> 21:57.897
That's need-to-know.

21:58.138 --> 22:02.507
- Any idea where they were heading?
- No. They were acting like G-men.

22:02.709 --> 22:03.676
How's that?

22:03.877 --> 22:07.108
They were asking questions
and not giving information.

22:07.314 --> 22:09.282
- Jerry!
- Sorry.

22:09.483 --> 22:12.247
We have to take the tapes
from your surveillance cameras.

22:12.452 --> 22:13.714
Talk to Security.

22:13.921 --> 22:16.788
Jerry, put it away.
I don't want to see it again.

22:16.990 --> 22:18.480
Hey, Carol.

22:18.692 --> 22:19.750
Excuse me.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.793
We're looking for my daughter.
She was in a car accident.

22:22.996 --> 22:26.329
- Shannon Mitchell?
- No, but she was in the same car.

22:26.533 --> 22:27.557
Melissa Harold.

22:28.235 --> 22:31.204
I'm sorry. Your daughter
hasn't been brought in yet.

22:31.638 --> 22:33.970
Another parent told us
they were brought here.

22:34.174 --> 22:36.665
Police and paramedics
are still looking...

22:36.877 --> 22:39.675
- Where is she?
- They're still looking for her!

22:39.947 --> 22:42.711
- Where?
- You should speak with a policeman.

22:42.916 --> 22:44.349
Reggie?

22:44.885 --> 22:46.216
Come over here.

22:46.420 --> 22:49.719
These are Melissa Harold's parents
and they need information.

22:49.923 --> 22:51.288
Our daughter's missing?

22:51.491 --> 22:54.483
Yes. But it doesn't appear
she was in the vehicle.

22:54.695 --> 22:56.026
Doesn't "appear"?

22:56.230 --> 22:58.528
The car caught fire, ma'am.

22:59.499 --> 23:01.660
Hey. Are you all right?

23:01.868 --> 23:03.130
I'm fine.

23:03.337 --> 23:06.568
I'm sorry about before.
I'm just having a bad day today.

23:06.773 --> 23:09.037
I'd say it was a little more
than that.

23:09.810 --> 23:11.675
I'm not in the mood right now.

23:12.179 --> 23:13.271
Are you pregnant?

23:15.716 --> 23:17.206
Who told you?

23:18.418 --> 23:21.387
Nobody had to tell me.
You were upset about the x-ray.

23:21.588 --> 23:24.682
You didn't want to
expose the fetus to CMV.

23:25.726 --> 23:27.250
It was instinct, you know?

23:27.461 --> 23:31.761
I don't mind taking on the risks
of working in a hospital myself, but...

23:31.965 --> 23:33.523
It's perfectly understandable.

23:34.768 --> 23:36.531
How far along are you?

23:36.737 --> 23:38.136
Almost 15 weeks.

23:38.338 --> 23:41.569
Good. You didn't expose yourself
during the first trimester.

23:42.276 --> 23:45.006
Feel free to opt out
of treating infectious patients...

23:45.212 --> 23:48.238
...or doing anything that
makes you feel uncomfortable.

23:48.448 --> 23:51.815
We'll just deal with the rest
as we go along. Okay?

23:52.019 --> 23:53.316
Okay.

23:54.354 --> 23:55.412
Thanks, IKerry.

23:55.656 --> 23:56.953
Sure.

23:58.358 --> 24:00.292
<i>E</i> x <i>pose the spinous and lamina.</i>

24:01.161 --> 24:04.892
There. I can see the bony spicula
impinging on the spinal cord.

24:05.098 --> 24:09.626
No wonder she couldn't move her legs.
Let's rongeur that troublemaker.

24:10.604 --> 24:13.471
- You thought about what I said?
- What was that?

24:13.674 --> 24:16.609
About not wasting your life
on this trauma fellowship.

24:16.810 --> 24:21.304
- And miss out on cases like this?
- You're avoiding the question.

24:21.515 --> 24:25.849
- I don't have a lot of options.
- I'd consider you for cardiothoracic.

24:27.354 --> 24:30.915
- I could sneak in a late application.
- I thought it belonged to Peter.

24:31.124 --> 24:35.390
Well, he didn't hesitate to throw
his hat into your rice bowl, did he?

24:36.563 --> 24:38.997
This fragment's really embedded.

24:39.266 --> 24:42.167
Careful.
Not a large margin of error here.

24:44.838 --> 24:46.533
You shouldn't be out of bed.

24:46.740 --> 24:48.537
He's gonna die, isn't he?

24:48.742 --> 24:52.041
It's too early to tell.
I need you to sit down.

24:52.245 --> 24:55.078
I need to take a look
at those dressings.

24:57.718 --> 25:00.186
So your x-ray...

25:00.387 --> 25:03.686
...shows that you have
a fractured rib, okay?

25:05.625 --> 25:07.616
It'll hurt for a few weeks...

25:07.828 --> 25:09.921
...but it'll heal on its own.

25:11.064 --> 25:14.761
It's a brave thing you did, going
back in there for your friend.

25:14.968 --> 25:16.162
It won't matter.

25:17.204 --> 25:18.865
We're doing everything we can.

25:20.173 --> 25:24.303
They took my blood.
They think it was because I was drunk.

25:24.745 --> 25:27.339
Your blood-alcohol level was.09.

25:28.648 --> 25:31.014
I didn't mean for this to happen.

25:33.320 --> 25:36.448
- Let me know if you're in pain.
- Oh, my God!

25:36.656 --> 25:40.183
Oh, my God, Justin! You all right?

25:40.394 --> 25:42.726
- Will he be all right?
- I'm okay, Mom.

25:42.929 --> 25:45.989
- What happened?
- It was the CD player.

25:46.933 --> 25:50.391
I went to change the CD.
I totaled the car.

25:52.672 --> 25:55.732
Pulse ox is dropping.
It's 93 on 15 liters of oxygen.

25:55.942 --> 25:58.502
- Any burns to the airway?
- Some singed nasal hair.

25:58.712 --> 26:00.145
Chance of laryngeal edema.

26:00.347 --> 26:03.043
- And the Burn Unit?
- They called a registry nurse.

26:03.250 --> 26:04.717
She'll be here in an hour.

26:04.918 --> 26:08.786
- Tube him while you have an airway.
- I was waiting for the parents.

26:08.989 --> 26:10.616
They're on the road.

26:10.824 --> 26:12.451
- The sister?
- Still in surgery.

26:12.659 --> 26:15.594
Call the neighbors,
see if they have a car phone.

26:15.796 --> 26:18.196
It's up to you,
but don't crike him.

26:18.398 --> 26:19.558
Understood.

26:19.766 --> 26:21.700
What if we don't reach them?

26:21.902 --> 26:26.066
I tube him and he dies in the Burn
Unit within the next week.

26:26.273 --> 26:29.674
They can say goodbye. I want
to give him a chance to see them.

26:35.315 --> 26:36.373
How is she?

26:36.583 --> 26:39.177
Good. The pole nicked her liver.

26:39.386 --> 26:42.048
We repaired the defect
with very little blood loss.

26:42.255 --> 26:44.086
Good. Thanks.

26:46.159 --> 26:48.286
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:49.863 --> 26:54.232
Family Services said they'll watch
Bruce until someone can pick him up.

26:55.569 --> 26:56.900
How's he doing?

26:57.103 --> 26:58.468
He's asleep.

26:59.840 --> 27:01.774
Thank you.

27:03.877 --> 27:06.209
I'm sorry about what happened
downstairs.

27:06.413 --> 27:08.711
You don't need to explain.
I understand.

27:08.915 --> 27:11.645
It wasn't the HIV status.
I was afraid of the CMV.

27:11.852 --> 27:14.980
Really, you don't need to explain.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.523
Is that yours?

27:20.193 --> 27:21.524
Yeah.

27:24.664 --> 27:26.029
Time for your medication?

27:27.000 --> 27:28.558
Do you have it here?

27:28.969 --> 27:30.129
They're at home.

27:30.670 --> 27:32.797
Well, I can get it for you here.

27:33.707 --> 27:35.038
No.

27:35.842 --> 27:36.934
Thank you.

27:41.281 --> 27:44.079
Missing a dose could make it
harder to treat the HIV.

27:44.284 --> 27:45.808
I'm done with them.

27:46.753 --> 27:47.777
I'm sorry?

27:47.988 --> 27:50.422
I'm not going to take
any more medicine.

27:50.624 --> 27:52.888
It's not worth it. I can't function.

27:53.093 --> 27:56.995
Andrea, I know you're upset right now.

27:58.398 --> 28:00.764
But without your medication,
the chances...

28:00.967 --> 28:03.026
I know what it means.

28:04.571 --> 28:06.198
Bruce is 8.

28:06.406 --> 28:08.237
He needs a mother.

28:09.175 --> 28:13.976
It is more important that he have
a well mother for now...

28:14.180 --> 28:16.774
...than a sick one for longer.

28:22.188 --> 28:23.382
Good work, Lizzie.

28:23.590 --> 28:26.058
- What do you think?
- I give her a 50-50.

28:26.259 --> 28:28.056
Robert, you got a minute?

28:28.261 --> 28:30.092
Sure. You got her, Lizzie?

28:30.297 --> 28:31.457
Yeah.

28:32.332 --> 28:36.291
Look, I want to do this now. Where
are you on the trauma fellowship?

28:36.503 --> 28:40.701
I don't see the need, but if I'm the
minority, I vote for Georgetown guy.

28:40.907 --> 28:43.239
- IKerry?
- Benton's the strongest candidate.

28:43.944 --> 28:47.072
- Mark?
- Elizabeth brought us the idea.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.714
She has passion and certainly talent.

28:49.916 --> 28:52.248
I don't want to see
either one wasted on this.

28:52.452 --> 28:54.386
They both applied, didn't they?

28:54.588 --> 28:57.284
Well, it looks like you're all
of separate minds.

28:57.490 --> 29:00.755
It's late, I want to go home,
so I'll make this quick.

29:00.961 --> 29:02.724
Peter Benton it is. Thank you.

29:12.505 --> 29:15.531
- How's he doing?
- Pulse ox 92.

29:17.444 --> 29:20.777
- Could you get Dr. Carter?
- Sure.

29:24.417 --> 29:27.011
Travis, are you awake?

29:30.991 --> 29:35.223
The doctor needs to put a tube down
your throat to help you breathe now.

29:37.430 --> 29:38.863
Can you talk?

29:42.602 --> 29:47.301
I have your parents on the phone.
They're in a car on their way here.

29:47.507 --> 29:49.498
I thought you'd want to talk to them.

29:49.709 --> 29:51.540
How long?

29:52.646 --> 29:55.581
They'll be here in 45 minutes
but we can't wait.

29:55.782 --> 29:57.807
I mean, how long will the tube be in?

30:00.053 --> 30:01.987
At least a few days.

30:05.025 --> 30:06.287
Are you ready?

30:06.693 --> 30:07.819
Okay.

30:16.770 --> 30:18.101
Mr. Mitchell?

30:18.772 --> 30:20.763
Okay, you can talk to him now.

30:29.315 --> 30:32.079
Okay. It's okay.

30:32.519 --> 30:34.214
There you go.

30:36.089 --> 30:37.818
Hey, Dad.

30:39.092 --> 30:41.492
I know. I can't believe it.

30:43.530 --> 30:45.395
Did the doctor tell you?

30:47.934 --> 30:50.266
It's pretty bad.

30:52.072 --> 30:54.404
I don't think I'm gonna...

30:54.874 --> 30:57.934
I don't think I'm gonna make it
to the lake this summer.

31:02.282 --> 31:06.412
I don't know.
They took her into surgery.

31:06.619 --> 31:09.645
But I haven't heard anything yet.

31:14.294 --> 31:17.730
Hey, they have to put this tube in me.

31:17.931 --> 31:22.300
So, I'm not gonna be able
to talk for a couple of days.

31:23.636 --> 31:27.003
Okay, I'll see you when you get here.

31:29.409 --> 31:30.535
Hey...

31:31.478 --> 31:33.105
...Mom.

31:35.381 --> 31:38.282
You gotta hang in there.

31:38.651 --> 31:41.620
I'm okay. I mean, just a little...

31:46.626 --> 31:48.856
I love you too.

31:53.700 --> 31:55.292
Pulse ox is 89.

31:55.502 --> 31:59.131
Draw up four of Versed, then
insert with the angular tip.

31:59.339 --> 32:00.966
Number eight ET tube.

32:05.044 --> 32:06.841
Okay, Travis...

32:07.347 --> 32:09.713
...you're gonna feel a little sleepy.

32:09.916 --> 32:13.613
When you wake up, there will be
a ventilator helping you breathe.

32:25.632 --> 32:26.894
Hey.

32:27.534 --> 32:30.560
That's not a very
encouraging entrance.

32:31.137 --> 32:35.005
I'm sorry. You didn't get
the trauma fellowship.

32:37.977 --> 32:40.912
- Is it Peter?
- Yeah.

32:42.182 --> 32:44.241
That's that, then.

32:44.450 --> 32:46.884
I was looking forward
to working with you.

32:47.086 --> 32:49.384
Yeah. Same here.

32:52.225 --> 32:53.692
So now what?

32:54.060 --> 32:58.929
I guess I'm left to pick up scraps
wherever I can find them.

32:59.465 --> 33:01.592
Doesn't mean he was
a better candidate.

33:01.801 --> 33:03.701
Oh, I know.

33:07.140 --> 33:09.938
How much more time do you have
on your internship?

33:10.143 --> 33:11.542
Three weeks.

33:12.078 --> 33:15.047
You'll have your license.
You can do anything you want.

33:15.281 --> 33:17.511
Except the trauma fellowship.

33:17.717 --> 33:19.412
Just about anything.

33:22.956 --> 33:25.948
- How did the voting go?
- I think you know.

33:26.159 --> 33:29.595
Yeah, Romano didn't want either,
Anspaugh was keen on Benton.

33:29.796 --> 33:32.822
- Don't tell me you were.
- No, I wanted you.

33:33.032 --> 33:35.125
But I'm not really objective.

33:36.336 --> 33:37.826
Really?

33:42.008 --> 33:44.272
- You know what you need?
- What?

33:44.677 --> 33:47.009
A milkshake.
What time do you get off?

33:47.914 --> 33:50.405
- Midnight.
- Okay, I'll find you.

33:51.651 --> 33:54.347
Is this more of your bad-day therapy?

33:54.554 --> 33:56.522
It's free of charge.

33:57.090 --> 33:58.421
I'm sorry.

34:06.499 --> 34:09.400
- What about the place up the street?
- Don't go there.

34:09.601 --> 34:10.591
Excuse me.

34:13.973 --> 34:15.496
- Who is that?
- Who?

34:15.708 --> 34:18.734
- Talking to Chuny.
- I don't know. She works in Urology.

34:18.945 --> 34:19.934
Really?

34:20.146 --> 34:22.706
- Carter, are you on for a while?
- Six hours.

34:22.916 --> 34:24.940
A social worker's coming
from the HIV clinic...

34:25.150 --> 34:27.119
...to see a patient
in the surgical ward.

34:27.353 --> 34:28.342
Sure.

34:28.554 --> 34:31.887
- Randi, did you get that?
- Yeah. HIV clinic to Carter.

34:32.091 --> 34:33.888
ER? Yeah, she's right here.

34:34.092 --> 34:36.152
Carol? Doug.

34:36.896 --> 34:39.420
I'll get it in the lounge.

34:39.866 --> 34:42.164
- Hey, Chuny.
- What?

34:42.402 --> 34:46.202
- Is that the friend you talked about?
- You're too late now.

34:46.438 --> 34:49.135
- There was a time limit?
- You're so shallow.

34:49.342 --> 34:52.469
- I'm reconsidering your proposal.
- You snooze, you lose.

34:52.679 --> 34:55.045
"You snooze, you lose."
Is this 10th grade?

34:55.248 --> 34:58.274
- I set her up with an intern.
- Intern!

34:58.484 --> 35:02.750
I tell you what. If you're nice,
I'll try to get her to reconsider.

35:02.956 --> 35:04.389
<i>Adi Ãs.</i>

35:05.325 --> 35:07.452
Lucy, your prescription's ready.

35:07.660 --> 35:08.649
- You sick?
- No.

35:08.861 --> 35:10.260
- What is it then?
- Nothing.

35:10.463 --> 35:12.658
- Why are you on medication?
- Why are you nosy?

35:12.865 --> 35:15.698
- Who prescribed it?
- It's none of your business.

35:16.402 --> 35:18.962
This morning I saw you,
you were exhausted.

35:19.172 --> 35:22.232
You popped a pill and you were fine.
Now you're dragging.

35:22.442 --> 35:24.342
I'm not on speed, if you're asking.

35:24.544 --> 35:28.002
- So, what is it?
- Ritalin, okay? I'm on Ritalin.

35:28.214 --> 35:30.239
- Ritalin? Since when?
- Fifth grade.

35:30.450 --> 35:31.439
What?

35:31.651 --> 35:34.882
I tried to get off it, but my
grades dropped, so I kept on.

35:35.088 --> 35:38.455
- You've been on it since?
- Never been a good time to stop.

35:39.592 --> 35:41.719
Now would be a good time to stop.

35:41.928 --> 35:43.190
I'm not an addict.

35:43.396 --> 35:45.159
You shouldn't still be taking it.

35:45.365 --> 35:47.993
- It's a stimulant.
- I don't take it to get high.

35:48.201 --> 35:50.294
- I take it to function.
- You got A.D.D.?

35:50.503 --> 35:53.301
It wasn't a problem until
I was working so many nights.

35:53.506 --> 35:56.339
Ritalin is for hyperactive children.
You're 24.

35:56.542 --> 35:59.102
My doctor prescribes it,
so nothing's wrong.

35:59.312 --> 36:02.975
- You gonna take it forever?
- I'll stop when things are less hectic.

36:03.182 --> 36:04.979
Things are never less hectic.

36:05.184 --> 36:06.412
I'll think about it.

36:06.619 --> 36:08.644
But this really is my business.

36:08.855 --> 36:10.720
And I hope you'll respect that.

36:13.860 --> 36:18.058
<i>The signer's head leans to the right</i>
<i>and rests on the upturned palm...</i>

36:20.933 --> 36:21.991
Hey.

36:22.635 --> 36:23.966
Hey.

36:24.470 --> 36:26.495
I suppose congratulations
are in order.

36:27.540 --> 36:28.529
Look, Elizabeth.

36:30.276 --> 36:34.303
- You don't have to say that.
- I'm just trying to be gracious.

36:35.681 --> 36:36.705
Thank you.

36:39.852 --> 36:40.841
Peter.

36:41.454 --> 36:44.014
Elizabeth,
would you excuse us, please?

36:44.390 --> 36:46.654
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

36:50.029 --> 36:52.862
I always considered you
a man of your word.

36:53.066 --> 36:56.160
- I never said I'd take it.
- You wanted cardiothoracic.

36:56.369 --> 36:58.064
I said I was interested.

37:04.844 --> 37:07.438
Missed your calling.
You should've been a lawyer.

37:09.449 --> 37:10.814
I couldn't count on it.

37:11.017 --> 37:13.212
I told you I'd push for you. I have.

37:13.419 --> 37:16.183
Thank you, but I'm taking
the trauma fellowship.

37:18.624 --> 37:20.319
Fine. Whatever, Peter.

37:20.526 --> 37:23.984
I'm done looking out for you.
Throwing your life away is up to you.

37:24.197 --> 37:25.186
It is.

37:25.398 --> 37:28.492
Just don't come to me
when you realize you made a mistake.

37:30.002 --> 37:31.697
- Were you serious?
- What?

37:31.904 --> 37:34.873
The offer you made today.
Were you serious?

37:36.709 --> 37:39.200
Dr. Greene?
Someone left this off for you.

37:39.412 --> 37:41.642
- What is it?
- Do I read your mail?

37:42.248 --> 37:44.307
"Thanks for patching up Amber."

37:44.517 --> 37:46.883
- Who's Amber?
- She's a stripper.

37:47.086 --> 37:49.077
Whoa. Must've liked you a lot.

37:49.288 --> 37:52.086
- How much is there?
- Looks like about two grand.

37:52.291 --> 37:53.280
Party!

37:53.493 --> 37:56.360
Randi, get out the phone book
and look up "FBI."

37:56.562 --> 37:58.530
Have them come pick this up.

38:00.266 --> 38:02.166
Excuse me.

38:02.368 --> 38:05.860
I'm Greg Mitchell. Our son
and daughter were in an accident.

38:10.309 --> 38:13.870
I'm Dr. Greene. I saw both of them
here in the Emergency Department.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.445
Where are they?

38:16.315 --> 38:18.806
Shannon underwent surgery.

38:19.018 --> 38:23.455
There was a broken vertebra in her back
that was impinging on her spinal cord.

38:23.656 --> 38:24.816
But she'll be okay?

38:25.024 --> 38:28.187
It's possible she'll lose function
below her waist.

38:28.561 --> 38:30.119
Oh, God.

38:31.164 --> 38:35.123
Travis suffered third-degree burns
over the majority of his body.

38:36.469 --> 38:37.663
Third-degree?

38:37.970 --> 38:39.801
He's up in the Burn Unit.

38:40.006 --> 38:43.669
They're doing everything to make him
as comfortable as possible.

38:44.510 --> 38:45.841
But I have to tell you...

38:46.412 --> 38:48.437
...that with burns
of this magnitude...

38:48.748 --> 38:51.273
...the survival rate is very low.

38:55.588 --> 38:56.885
He's gonna die?

38:58.858 --> 39:01.053
He has a 20 percent chance
of survival.

39:02.195 --> 39:04.163
Oh, God!

39:04.363 --> 39:05.853
No!

39:26.953 --> 39:28.284
You're up.

39:30.356 --> 39:31.687
Where am I?

39:31.891 --> 39:34.553
The O.R. Recovery Room.
We operated on your back.

39:34.760 --> 39:37.422
You were in a car accident.
Do you remember?

39:39.031 --> 39:41.056
I thought it was a dream.

39:41.934 --> 39:43.333
Can I do a quick test?

39:49.809 --> 39:52.778
Tell me when you feel something,
all right?

40:00.586 --> 40:03.555
Shannon, are you with me?

40:03.756 --> 40:04.882
Yeah.

40:06.192 --> 40:09.218
There! What does that mean?

40:09.895 --> 40:12.295
It's no better. It's no worse.

40:14.267 --> 40:17.168
Let's see how your big toe's doing,
shall we?

40:21.974 --> 40:24.067
I want you to wiggle it like before.

40:24.543 --> 40:25.601
All right?

40:30.249 --> 40:31.273
Again.

40:36.122 --> 40:37.589
Is it moving?

40:39.625 --> 40:41.616
Let's just wait and see.

40:41.827 --> 40:44.455
The swelling has to come down first.

40:46.332 --> 40:49.199
Lily, I took Mr. And Mrs. Mitchell
to the Burn Unit.

40:49.402 --> 40:51.734
Show one of them to Surgical Recovery.

40:51.937 --> 40:53.165
- Sure.
- Thanks.

40:53.372 --> 40:56.205
- Mark, I wouldn't go in there.
- Why?

40:56.409 --> 40:59.435
We're giving Carol some space.
Doug called.

41:08.154 --> 41:10.782
- Carol?
- Go away, Mark.

41:15.695 --> 41:17.322
Did you tell him?

41:19.165 --> 41:20.928
He's not coming.

41:26.072 --> 41:29.269
- Did you ask him not to come?
- Yeah.

41:31.010 --> 41:33.444
I was very strong...

41:33.646 --> 41:34.840
...and clear.

41:36.315 --> 41:38.875
So he's respecting your wishes?

41:40.353 --> 41:42.878
That would be a first time,
wouldn't it?

41:47.193 --> 41:49.024
You wanted him to come.

41:51.030 --> 41:52.292
No.

41:56.635 --> 41:58.068
I've had...

41:58.971 --> 42:03.874
...hundreds of conversations
with him in my head, you know?

42:06.078 --> 42:10.606
What I would say,
what I would do if he showed up.

42:12.718 --> 42:15.551
I wouldn't let him
charm his way back in.

42:15.755 --> 42:17.347
Not now.

42:18.457 --> 42:20.755
Not because of the baby.

42:25.998 --> 42:28.398
I would never feel secure...

42:28.601 --> 42:31.934
...knowing that that's why
he came back.

42:34.373 --> 42:37.001
Maybe he feels the same way.

42:44.049 --> 42:46.609
I still expected him to come.

42:54.527 --> 42:56.256
I've gotta go home.

42:56.762 --> 42:58.286
You know what you need?

42:58.697 --> 42:59.925
What?

43:01.033 --> 43:02.261
What?

43:02.468 --> 43:05.562
You need a milkshake.

43:05.971 --> 43:09.998
Elizabeth and I are going to get
a milkshake. Why don't you come?

43:10.209 --> 43:12.268
No. I'm tired and I'm gonna go home.

43:12.478 --> 43:14.946
No, no. Just one...

43:15.147 --> 43:17.138
...little milkshake, okay?

43:17.349 --> 43:18.782
It was a date, wasn't it?

43:18.984 --> 43:22.078
Look, no. It wasn't a date.

43:22.888 --> 43:25.618
We were just gonna drown
our sorrows in ice cream.

43:26.192 --> 43:28.752
- Come on.
- I don't want to be a third wheel.

43:29.695 --> 43:32.425
How many times
have I been a third wheel?

43:33.933 --> 43:37.061
That's true. You do owe me.

43:40.573 --> 43:42.473
That's the spirit.

43:43.242 --> 43:44.800
Are you paying?

43:45.411 --> 43:48.403
- Of course I'm paying.
- Because I'm eating for two.
