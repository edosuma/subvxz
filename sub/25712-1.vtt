This husband...

Well, I'd love to be your assistant,

- Awesome!

05:57.190 --> 05:59.401
Actually, tonight we were planning
on family night.

Okay, cool. Another time.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.654
Enjoy!

06:03.738 --> 06:07.200
- What are you trying to do?
- Wait, wait! No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

06:11.496 --> 06:13.498
I know I've been out of it
these last couple weeks.

06:13.582 --> 06:14.749
Weeks?

06:15.876 --> 06:16.793
That was a good insult.

06:17.752 --> 06:18.837
Thank you.

So what are we gonna do?

06:27.804 --> 06:28.722
I don't know.

- [woman] Reset.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.341
Wow. I don't remember the last time
I saw you crash a machine.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.177
The current split
and blew up both the systems.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.720
Sleeping okay?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.514
Yeah. Well, better.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.142
You know, it's funny,
I was talking to somebody

07:56.226 --> 07:59.354
and they were telling me
about this clinic that people go to...

07:59.854 --> 08:02.482
for, you know, sleeplessness and stress.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.359
I could get you the number.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.988
- I'm just trying...
- No, no. It's just a little mistake.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.156
I'm gonna fix it.

08:10.782 --> 08:11.950
Sure. I got you.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.327
Okay.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.789
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Okay.

08:18.581 --> 08:20.250
Oh, um... David?

08:21.126 --> 08:24.004
Is there any way I could...
take off early today?

08:25.588 --> 08:26.840
Will you call the number for me?

08:28.383 --> 08:29.426
Yeah.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.302
All right.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.152
[woman] The aim would be to update
the drainage systems

08:47.235 --> 08:50.447
along Prescott, Calder, and Willow.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.825
Now, I believe that if we focus
on the tunnels beneath these streets,

08:53.908 --> 08:58.747
we could reduce overall runoff
in the city's west side by up to 30%.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.416
Thank you all so much.
That's all for today.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.713
They should have done the upgrade
years ago.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.465
Hey, that was great, Al.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.800
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.552
It makes me look good for promoting you.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.554
You want to work late tonight,

09:14.637 --> 09:17.015
talk about how to get this over the line
with Water and Power?

09:17.098 --> 09:21.186
Oh, I-I was actually going to ask you
if I could leave early today.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.605
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

36:32.232 --> 36:33.274
What is happening?

36:41.116 --> 36:42.617
[Hanna] We'll be safe up here,

36:43.535 --> 36:45.495
- right?
- [Alice] Just stay close to me.

36:51.334 --> 36:52.419
[Alice] Who are they?

36:53.128 --> 36:54.462
Why are they doing this?

36:54.546 --> 36:56.631
[people screaming in the distance]

37:03.680 --> 37:04.764
[Hanna] Those people!

37:06.725 --> 37:07.642
What do we do?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.144
I don't know.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.067
[Peter] Get down!

37:27.996 --> 37:29.080
Mommy!

37:31.708 --> 37:32.834
What's happening?

37:49.476 --> 37:52.020
Hey, Alice. We can't stay up here.

37:55.732 --> 37:57.650
- Come on, Lucy.
- Let's get out of here.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.153
- Okay, come on. Stay calm.
- Where are we going?

38:00.236 --> 38:02.530
- Don't let go of each other's hands.
- Where are we going?

38:02.614 --> 38:04.449
[Peter] I think we can use this
to get down.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.701
- We should use this.
- [Alice] What? No.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.244
- Alice!
- No! No.

38:08.328 --> 38:10.121
- I'm not putting the girls on that.
- Alice!

38:10.205 --> 38:12.540
- No! I'm not getting in there.
- We need to get off this roof.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.626
If it's between taking the girls
through the building

38:14.709 --> 38:17.295
- or putting them in that thing...
- If we stay here, we die.

38:17.378 --> 38:19.005
If we go through the building, we die.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.424
Just trust me, please.
I need you to trust me.

38:21.508 --> 38:24.219
We haven't got time for this.
This is gonna work. Let's go.

38:27.889 --> 38:28.723
[Samantha] No!

38:28.807 --> 38:30.767
- I don't wanna go down there!
- It's okay, come on.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.477
- Okay, okay.
- No!

38:32.560 --> 38:33.520
Okay.

38:34.270 --> 38:36.523
- Come on. Come with us.
- Get her down.

38:36.606 --> 38:37.816
I don't wanna go, Mommy!

38:53.623 --> 38:54.457
[Alice] Baby...

39:02.841 --> 39:04.259
[cries]

39:06.594 --> 39:08.638
Oh, Mommy, I'm scared!

39:08.721 --> 39:10.431
I don't like it up here, Mommy.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.600
[crying]

39:14.978 --> 39:16.145
What's happening?

39:19.858 --> 39:21.276
[all scream]

39:21.359 --> 39:22.235
Mommy!

39:22.318 --> 39:23.653
[Peter] I got you, I got you!

39:23.736 --> 39:25.613
- Hold on, hold on!
- Nobody move.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.574
- I wanna get off!
- Don't move!

39:28.700 --> 39:30.493
[creaking]

39:32.328 --> 39:33.496
We gotta go in.

39:35.748 --> 39:37.125
[Alice] No! Lucy, don't look down!

39:37.208 --> 39:38.793
Go on, Lucy. Come on.

39:38.877 --> 39:39.919
Come on! Go, go, go!

39:40.920 --> 39:42.589
- Hanna, let's go.
- They could be in there!

39:42.672 --> 39:43.882
Hanna, we have to go!

39:43.965 --> 39:45.133
Quick, quick!

39:46.050 --> 39:47.176
[screaming]

39:47.260 --> 39:48.636
- Grab on!
- Go, go!

39:59.564 --> 40:03.651
HANNA LUCY
HERMAN

40:07.697 --> 40:09.282
[mechanical whirring]

41:18.434 --> 41:20.645
Here. I found a flashlight.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.397
Don't turn it on, okay?

41:35.910 --> 41:36.953
In the dreams...

41:42.250 --> 41:43.626
did you see them kill us?

41:47.755 --> 41:49.132
[gunfire]

41:51.634 --> 41:54.846
- [Alice] <i>Did you see them kill our girls?</i>
- Mommy, wake up.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.724
Mommy, please wake up.

41:57.807 --> 41:59.892
[Alice] <i>Peter, you have to tell me.</i>

42:04.313 --> 42:05.356
[gunshot]

42:08.609 --> 42:09.902
Hey, any luck with this?

42:12.030 --> 42:14.574
[Peter] Um, the technology's
not much different than ours,

42:14.657 --> 42:18.244
but it's got a biometric trigger,
which can only be shot by its owner.

42:18.327 --> 42:21.039
- [Ray] Can you bypass it or something?
- I'm working on it.

42:22.165 --> 42:25.251
Either way, I don't think
we should stay here much longer.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.253
No, I think we need to leave the city.

42:27.336 --> 42:29.088
Find some place to hide.

42:29.714 --> 42:31.466
- Wait for help.
- Wait, wait...

42:32.800 --> 42:35.511
The factory I work at,
it's not far from here...

42:36.095 --> 42:37.680
and it's a government building.

42:41.684 --> 42:43.811
And it's, uh... it's right there.

42:44.395 --> 42:46.773
It's like... it's about ten blocks away.

42:47.356 --> 42:48.483
[Samantha] Is it safe?

42:48.941 --> 42:50.568
How do we know anywhere
is safe right now?

42:51.110 --> 42:53.946
Because of what's underneath it.
It's all storage space.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.656
It's like a fortress down there.

42:56.824 --> 42:58.117
I mean, it's just getting there.

42:58.201 --> 43:00.244
[screaming and gunfire in the distance]

43:00.912 --> 43:03.247
[Ray] Yeah, they're still firing
at anything that moves.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.333
Unfortunately, that's our only chance.

43:05.917 --> 43:06.751
The tunnels.

43:07.835 --> 43:10.129
The tunnels, there's the entrance...

43:10.213 --> 43:12.799
What street? There's the opening on...

43:13.716 --> 43:14.967
- Prescott!
- On Prescott!

43:15.051 --> 43:18.679
That's only a few blocks from here. We can
get to the factory through the tunnels.

43:18.763 --> 43:19.764
- [Peter] Yeah.
- Yes.

43:19.847 --> 43:22.100
- We can make it a few blocks, right?
- Yeah.

43:23.059 --> 43:24.310
[all scream]

43:43.037 --> 43:45.039
[indistinct yelling]

43:56.676 --> 43:57.635
Dad!

43:59.637 --> 44:00.471
Daddy!

44:00.555 --> 44:01.764
[both scream]

44:02.348 --> 44:04.183
[screaming indistinctly]

44:04.267 --> 44:05.977
[mechanical sound]

44:06.394 --> 44:07.645
Lucy!

44:07.937 --> 44:08.771
[screaming]

44:08.855 --> 44:10.231
[gunfire]

44:20.867 --> 44:22.910
[screaming]

44:26.164 --> 44:28.166
Come on, let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

44:31.294 --> 44:32.295
This way! Come here!

44:36.090 --> 44:38.551
- Move it! Oh, shit! Get down!
- [gunfire]

44:47.268 --> 44:48.519
[Lucy screams]

44:55.193 --> 44:56.736
[Peter yells indistinctly]

45:04.619 --> 45:06.579
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

45:08.247 --> 45:09.373
[gunfire]

45:11.500 --> 45:12.585
Dad!

45:12.668 --> 45:13.544
[gunfire]

45:17.548 --> 45:19.467
- All right, let's move.
- [Hanna] No, not there!

45:19.926 --> 45:21.969
The factory's ten blocks away,
we're gonna be safe.

45:22.053 --> 45:24.472
We're not going
to let anything happen to you.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.724
Okay? To either of you.

45:27.308 --> 45:28.517
- Okay?
- Let's go, let's go!

45:28.601 --> 45:29.936
- Okay? Come on.
- Let's go!

45:32.980 --> 45:35.233
[Lucy] Are we gonna die
like Megan's family?

45:35.942 --> 45:37.860
[Peter] Don't worry, honey,
you'll be safe.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.662
[indistinct yelling]

45:47.745 --> 45:49.330
Come on, come on. Lucy.

45:49.747 --> 45:50.623
[shushing]

45:51.874 --> 45:52.875
[man] Please, stop!

45:53.251 --> 45:54.585
[man yells indistinctly]

45:57.755 --> 45:59.507
[man screams]

46:00.091 --> 46:01.217
[man groans]

46:03.427 --> 46:05.263
[gunfire]

46:13.479 --> 46:15.064
- Who are they?
- I don't know.

46:18.901 --> 46:20.027
Go!

46:24.699 --> 46:25.825
Go, go! Get down!

46:27.034 --> 46:28.744
[Alice] Stay down. Stay down.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.797
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Come on!

46:39.880 --> 46:40.965
- Come on, run!
- Go, go, go!

46:41.048 --> 46:41.924
Run, run, run!

47:05.156 --> 47:05.990
Up here.

47:06.699 --> 47:08.659
- Come on.
- [Peter] Where should we go?

47:09.201 --> 47:10.244
It's to the right.

47:22.965 --> 47:23.799
Okay...

47:25.051 --> 47:27.887
- [Alice] On the other side of the plants.
- [Peter] Okay, I'll go first.

47:28.596 --> 47:29.680
Stay down.

47:40.775 --> 47:42.193
[grunting]

47:44.028 --> 47:45.446
[grunting]

47:54.497 --> 47:55.373
Go, hurry.

47:56.624 --> 47:59.043
Here, get up. We have to be quick.

48:01.170 --> 48:02.630
Okay, come here. Come here.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.715
Okay, be careful. Be careful.

48:07.593 --> 48:09.220
Stay right there. Stay right there.

48:10.471 --> 48:12.306
- Come on.
- Go. Go to Dad.

48:18.479 --> 48:19.480
Lucy!

48:20.898 --> 48:21.899
Lucy!

48:23.109 --> 48:24.068
Lucy, come here!

48:29.532 --> 48:30.574
Take her!

48:31.909 --> 48:33.244
Come on!

48:37.790 --> 48:39.291
[gunfire]

48:39.375 --> 48:41.001
- Let's go! Let's go!
- [Lucy screams]

48:43.546 --> 48:44.588
[all scream]

49:01.856 --> 49:04.358
- [Hanna panting]
- [Lucy coughing]

49:07.987 --> 49:09.321
Is everyone okay?

49:09.989 --> 49:10.990
You okay?

49:12.658 --> 49:14.535
[Lucy continues coughing]

49:19.540 --> 49:20.374
Mom?

49:25.296 --> 49:26.130
Dad?

49:27.298 --> 49:28.382
Do something.

49:31.469 --> 49:32.303
[Lucy cries]

50:13.719 --> 50:14.845
[Lucy] Mommy...

50:16.472 --> 50:17.806
It's okay, baby.

50:18.224 --> 50:19.433
Okay, watch your step.

50:20.893 --> 50:21.894
There we go.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.564
Okay, which way?

50:26.565 --> 50:27.650
We're under the park.

50:29.443 --> 50:30.277
North.

50:31.111 --> 50:31.946
Okay.

50:32.321 --> 50:33.155
Come on, girls.

50:38.452 --> 50:40.037
[Alice] What happens from here?

50:41.121 --> 50:42.248
Did you see this?

50:43.249 --> 50:44.375
[Peter] Not like this.

50:44.875 --> 50:46.961
[Alice] Promise me that you're going...

50:48.128 --> 50:49.505
to protect the girls.

50:51.924 --> 50:53.384
No matter what happens.

50:54.426 --> 50:55.261
Okay?

50:55.344 --> 50:57.054
- Alice...
- Just promise me.

50:58.973 --> 51:01.183
I don't want to do this
without you, please.

51:01.725 --> 51:04.186
- Please, I don't want to. Please...
- Promise...

51:04.270 --> 51:06.230
I know you can do it.

51:06.855 --> 51:08.732
Come on, you can do it.

51:09.733 --> 51:10.568
Please.

51:12.403 --> 51:13.237
Okay.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.447
There you go, there you go.

51:15.990 --> 51:16.865
Yes.

51:16.949 --> 51:18.617
There we go, that's my Alice.

51:19.034 --> 51:20.160
That's my Alice.

51:24.999 --> 51:26.250
I need to sit.

51:26.333 --> 51:28.127
No problem. Okay, okay.

51:31.422 --> 51:32.256
Okay.

51:33.382 --> 51:34.216
Here.

51:37.344 --> 51:38.304
Rub her hands.

51:39.638 --> 51:41.890
- Is she gonna be okay?
- Yes, she's gonna be fine.

51:41.974 --> 51:43.559
Keep them warm. Keep them warm.

51:44.643 --> 51:47.313
You're doing okay. You're doing okay.

51:48.981 --> 51:51.442
Let her rest, it's fine. It's okay.

51:51.734 --> 51:53.319
- It's okay.
- Daddy!

51:53.986 --> 51:54.945
[grunting]

51:58.907 --> 52:00.743
Leave my daddy alone!

52:14.006 --> 52:15.549
[Lucy] Daddy, I'm scared.

52:16.759 --> 52:18.052
[Peter] Just stay there.

52:35.527 --> 52:38.030
[gunfire]

52:45.704 --> 52:46.997
[grunts]

52:50.793 --> 52:53.671
[grunting]

53:07.309 --> 53:08.394
Why are you here?

53:13.482 --> 53:14.983
You want to hurt my family?

53:15.067 --> 53:17.569
Is that what you want?
You want to hurt my family?

54:02.906 --> 54:03.741
What...

54:05.159 --> 54:06.160
Who are you?

54:12.040 --> 54:13.250
Why are you doing this?

54:15.210 --> 54:16.044
[Hanna] Mom?

54:18.046 --> 54:19.089
Mom?

54:19.882 --> 54:21.550
She... she won't wake up!

54:21.633 --> 54:23.844
Mom, wake up! Mom!

54:23.927 --> 54:25.679
- [Lucy] Say something!
- [Hanna] Mom!

54:26.305 --> 54:28.724
- Mom, come on, wake up!
- Daddy, help!

54:29.600 --> 54:30.434
Mommy!

54:30.517 --> 54:32.686
Let's get her up. Let's get Mommy up.

54:33.562 --> 54:36.190
[Alice grunts]

54:38.484 --> 54:39.610
Girls, get behind me.

54:40.235 --> 54:41.361
Get behind me, girls.

54:41.445 --> 54:43.197
Get behind me. Lucy, get behind me.

54:50.829 --> 54:51.789
Pick her up.

54:52.664 --> 54:53.749
Do you understand me?

54:56.919 --> 54:58.086
Pick her up right now.

55:05.552 --> 55:06.678
Pick her up right now.

55:07.095 --> 55:08.680
And I want you to move slow.

56:12.119 --> 56:12.995
Hello?

56:14.830 --> 56:15.914
Hello?

56:15.998 --> 56:17.666
- [bangs on door]
- Hello?

56:18.166 --> 56:19.626
Maybe one of the other doors.

56:20.127 --> 56:21.503
Mom needs help now.

56:34.933 --> 56:35.976
No, no.

56:36.059 --> 56:38.186
- Oh, here, here.
- Here. Move!

56:38.270 --> 56:40.147
No, no, no!
Please, please! Please, no, no!

56:40.230 --> 56:41.189
No, no, no, please.

56:41.273 --> 56:43.358
That's my wife, she's in bad shape.
We need help.

56:43.442 --> 56:44.359
Peter?

56:45.027 --> 56:46.778
- David.
- [man] Hold up, hold up!

56:48.030 --> 56:49.489
- Hey.
- You got one.

56:49.573 --> 56:52.075
Alice, she's in bad shape right now,
she needs help right away.

56:52.159 --> 56:54.244
Hey, gurney! Right now!

56:54.328 --> 56:55.162
[man] Yes, sir!

56:55.871 --> 56:56.705
Coming through.

56:56.788 --> 56:59.499
She was hit on the left side really bad.

56:59.583 --> 57:01.126
Any other injuries?

57:01.209 --> 57:02.419
- Not that I...
- [Hanna] Dad!

57:03.503 --> 57:04.421
They're coming.

57:05.380 --> 57:06.965
[David] Everybody, inside, now!

57:25.859 --> 57:27.319
[woman] Hold her steady.

57:27.402 --> 57:28.236
Go ahead.

57:29.655 --> 57:31.281
- Scan her.
- You got to stop the bleeding.

57:31.365 --> 57:32.199
What is that?

57:33.367 --> 57:34.618
- Stop!
- Stop it!

57:34.701 --> 57:36.036
Wait, what are you doing?

57:36.119 --> 57:37.955
It's okay. It's a diagnostic.

57:38.038 --> 57:39.456
He knows what he's doing.

57:39.539 --> 57:42.209
[Peter] Stop! I said stop!
Don't touch her! Stop!

57:42.292 --> 57:44.169
- [Hanna] You're hurting her!
- I told you to stop!

57:44.252 --> 57:46.588
- Everybody just calm down.
- What the hell's going on?

57:46.672 --> 57:48.298
[David] We're all friends here, all right?

57:48.382 --> 57:50.717
[Lucy] Mommy! Stop it!

57:52.260 --> 57:54.054
Why does it feel
like you're prepared for this?

57:54.137 --> 57:57.015
What's happening out there has been
headed our way for a long time.

57:57.432 --> 57:59.643
But right now,
let's please focus on your wife

57:59.726 --> 58:01.353
and getting you and your family to safety.

58:01.770 --> 58:02.896
Please.

58:08.694 --> 58:10.612
There's an abandoned train station
below us.

58:10.696 --> 58:13.407
Headed to an underground base
where we've been stockpiling weapons.

58:13.490 --> 58:16.743
- What happened to all the storage?
- Sent ahead. We'll be safe.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.370
They'll never find us.

58:18.453 --> 58:21.248
Once we're there,
we'll finalize our plan to fight back.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.666
But I'm not a soldier.

58:22.749 --> 58:24.418
You'd be surprised
what you're capable of.

58:24.918 --> 58:26.294
- [loud thud]
- [screaming]

58:29.798 --> 58:30.841
They're directly above us.

58:30.924 --> 58:33.301
- They're gonna get through.
- [loud thud, screaming]

58:33.385 --> 58:36.179
Okay. Prepare for a breach
and get everyone downstairs now.

58:36.263 --> 58:37.347
- Yes, sir.
- Get rid of him.

58:37.431 --> 58:39.558
- Take him out back and kill him.
- It's your wife...

58:40.142 --> 58:42.310
The damage is way beyond
our ability to repair.

58:42.394 --> 58:44.980
If she can make it through the evacuation,
she might have a chance,

58:45.063 --> 58:46.356
but her system's shutting down.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.151
- There's nothing we can do.
- There's gotta be a way to help her.

58:49.234 --> 58:51.528
- I'm sorry, we don't have the equipment.
- Wait! No, no!

58:51.611 --> 58:54.656
- You can't quit on Mom.
- Nobody's quitting on Mom.

58:54.740 --> 58:56.283
Hey, I can help her! I can help her!

58:57.743 --> 58:59.745
I can help her, man!
I can keep her going!

59:00.203 --> 59:02.497
- What?
- I can keep her alive, keep her going!

59:03.165 --> 59:04.541
You can keep her going?

59:04.624 --> 59:06.376
- You trying to play games with me?
- I'm not.

59:06.460 --> 59:09.629
You our enemy? The medic said
he can't help her, and you can?

59:09.713 --> 59:11.465
I can keep her going long enough
to get help.

59:11.548 --> 59:13.050
- Why should I believe you?
- He's lying.

59:13.133 --> 59:14.593
- We have to go.
- It's not true.

59:14.676 --> 59:17.804
I had to learn everything about
your people, all right? There's ways.

59:17.888 --> 59:20.223
- [thud]
- [screaming]

59:21.183 --> 59:23.769
There's no time. We have to evacuate
right now. Get him out of here!

59:25.353 --> 59:26.688
- Go!
- I know what to do!

59:27.064 --> 59:28.315
- Let's go!
- Let me help!

59:30.442 --> 59:33.904
[Lucy crying]

59:34.362 --> 59:36.198
Okay, stop, stop! Stop!

59:40.077 --> 59:41.286
Okay, girls, girls.

59:42.579 --> 59:45.165
Okay, you have to listen to me.
You have to listen, okay?

59:45.248 --> 59:46.792
- You're going with David.
- No!

59:46.875 --> 59:49.377
I'm gonna stay with Mom
until she's good,

59:49.461 --> 59:51.630
and then I'm gonna join you guys,
I promise.

59:51.713 --> 59:53.006
We'll meet you at the train.

59:54.466 --> 59:55.425
Okay.

59:55.509 --> 59:57.469
[David] The evacuation transport
is downstairs.

59:57.552 --> 59:59.679
- We'll hold as long as we can.
- Okay.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.140
Girls, girls, girls, please, please.

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:04.101
- Know that I love you, okay?
- No!

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.268
[distorted] Dad!

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:07.938
No!

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:12.150
- Stop!
- Daddy! Dad!

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.118
You got time?

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:24.538
[man 1] Move, move!

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:26.957
[man 2] All the way down the back.
Let's go!

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:35.215
Give me a knife
and bring those lights over here.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.424
Stop.

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:44.432
Here you go.

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:49.479
All right.

01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:58.697
Hey! Easy! Easy, easy, please!

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:00.574
- Easy!
- You want me to do this?

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:02.325
I'm trying to help you!

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:29.311
All right.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:36.193
Oh, shit.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.112
They're right, it's bad.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.032
What is that? What is that?

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:44.951
What's in her?

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.078
What is that? What is in her?

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:51.291
You really don't know what... you are?

01:02:33.375 --> 01:02:35.335
Look, if you want to save her life,

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.337
she's gonna need
an alternative source of power.

01:02:40.423 --> 01:02:41.549
I'm talking about you.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:48.223
[people screaming indistinctly]

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:53.520
[Lucy] Hanna!

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.314
I lost Herman!

01:02:58.775 --> 01:02:59.859
[thudding]

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.036
Okay.

01:03:12.163 --> 01:03:13.957
Put the... put the knife down.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:18.503
And...

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:20.797
go over there.

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:28.805
Okay. All right, what do I do?

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:32.392
You got to...

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:36.688
You got to make an incision...
on your chest,

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:38.273
at a sideways edge.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:43.320
[thudding]

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:45.613

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:48.616
Okay.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.714
Okay.

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:06.217
Start at the top.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:09.179
Just make a straight line,
about six inches across.

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.352
[exhales]

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:19.564
[grunts]

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:55.952
I should warn you...

01:05:56.661 --> 01:05:57.829
if this doesn't work...

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.498
the current will split and...

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:02.959
then you're both dead.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.050
Let's do it.

01:06:16.764 --> 01:06:17.974

starting to wake up to the idea</i>

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:38.953

<i>We are not God, but we are their god</i>

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:43.625
<i>because we created them
and that makes us their god.</i>

to do with them whatever we want to.</i>

were against human beings,</i>

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:22.789
<i>Are they not starting
to exhibit lifelike tendencies</i>

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:26.459
<i>that would compel them to wonder
why they were built in the first place?</i>

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:32.757
Why did you do that?

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:39.639
I don't know.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:55.705
Hey...

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:57.081
it's okay.

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:01.752
Give me the gun.

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:03.588
Just give me the gun.

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:04.881
It's okay.

01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:07.508
Here I go.

01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:09.385
We're not gonna hurt you.

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:13.681
Are you guys here alone?

01:13:17.059 --> 01:13:19.770
They killed Mom and Dad
because they were human.

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:24.043
[woman] You'll no longer
have to live in fear.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:26.504
The memories of the past will be replaced.

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:28.130
And you will be a family.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:05.751
[Peter] Alice.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:09.422
[human] Careful.

01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:12.383
The cord's the only thing
keeping her alive right now.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.428
Okay, she's...
she's breathing better, that's good.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:19.223
- That's good.
- Wouldn't call it "breathing."

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:27.064
It worked.

01:15:28.315 --> 01:15:30.317
I don't know how long
it'll hold up, but...

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:34.655
It worked.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:43.914
I remember...

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:46.083
the... the war.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:48.627
You guys tried to wipe us out.

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:51.630
We chose to forget.

01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:54.008
Must be nice...

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:56.761
picking what memories you can keep.

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:02.016
Humans don't have that luxury.

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:10.608
Why are you helping us?

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:14.236
You could have killed us
when I was passed out.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:17.823
It was my grandparents
you chased off the planet.

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:22.411
I wasn't even born yet.

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:24.997
It was like 50 years ago.

01:16:30.461 --> 01:16:32.463
<i>We've been living in colonies
on Mars since.</i>

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:35.883
<i>None of us had even been to Earth before.</i>

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:38.302
<i>We didn't know what to expect.</i>

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:42.264
<i>Didn't even know
if we could still breathe down here.</i>

01:16:45.017 --> 01:16:46.435
<i>We did learn everything about you...</i>

01:16:47.728 --> 01:16:48.813
<i>the synthetics.</i>

01:16:51.649 --> 01:16:54.485
<i>How you drove us from our homes
and left us with nothing.</i>

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:59.782
<i>It took us all this time just to gather
the resources we needed to come back.</i>

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.202
<i>They told us you were monsters.</i>

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.122
<i>Savages.</i>

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:10.376
<i>It's kind of just one side of the story.</i>

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.089
<i>I know that now.</i>

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:20.845
<i>So why am I helping you?</i>

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.143
<i>'Cause no one said
I'd be coming down here killing kids...</i>

01:17:29.728 --> 01:17:30.646
<i>and families.</i>

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:34.024
<i>It's not what I signed up for.</i>

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:58.757
Peter.

01:17:59.717 --> 01:18:01.302
Baby! Baby?

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:03.721
- Hey, you're doing well.
- I saw...

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:06.182
I saw... I... I saw...

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:07.892
I saw... I...

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:11.645
Your dreams... it's the past.

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:13.772
It's our past.

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:16.567
- The dreams.
- Yeah.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:18.277
Those girls... the girls!

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.362
No, no, they're waiting for us.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:24.241

[man continues indistinctly over PA]

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.126
We can't wait any longer.

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:36.003
As soon as David gets here,
we're gone.

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:36.921
Last train!

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:39.006
Move, move, move!

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.800
- Lucy, come on.
- Not without Mommy and Daddy!

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:44.511
- Come on.
- They'll be here! Daddy said that!

You guys got to hide.

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.764
I'll tell them I'm alone
when they get in here, but...

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:31.767
- I don't know, it's your only shot.
- We gotta get back to the girls.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:35.646
All right.

01:19:36.230 --> 01:19:37.064
Come on.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:38.315

Here. You know what? Here.

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:08.637
It was never mine to begin with,
but thank you.

01:20:43.547 --> 01:20:44.465
Are you guys okay?

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:45.382
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:48.010
Okay, stay tight and low.
Cover, now! Go, go, go!

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:49.219

01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:29.570
How will they get in?

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.624
Come on!

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:47.004

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:54.553
Okay, look.

I need you girls
to get onto the transport now.

01:22:57.222 --> 01:22:59.391

I knew you'd save her.

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:47.476
Be right back.

01:25:50.937 --> 01:25:51.772
Come here.

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:53.732
Come here.

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:02.699
You remember?

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:05.369
Yeah.

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:06.912
Do they?

01:26:09.456 --> 01:26:10.415
[David] Like you,

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:13.293
they had their memories wiped...

01:26:14.252 --> 01:26:15.295
to start clean...

01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:18.548
without fear,

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:22.552
free of the guilt of...

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:25.097
what we had to do...

01:26:25.972 --> 01:26:27.391
just to be free.

01:26:28.308 --> 01:26:32.020
A few of us like me kept our memories,
so we could prepare for this day.

01:26:33.772 --> 01:26:35.899
But now they're all
gonna have to remember,

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:38.735
'cause this...

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:42.322
this is not over.

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:46.118
We'll be safe
at our underground base for now.

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:49.538
There, we'll finalize our plans
to take back home.

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:51.832
So be ready.

01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:40.839
I thought I lost you.

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:46.428
