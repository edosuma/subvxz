00:02.203 --> 00:04.172
BRYAN:
Having a baby on the way
with the holidays approaching,

00:04.205 --> 00:05.306
I can't help but think
of Goldie

00:05.339 --> 00:06.674
as our very own Virgin Mary,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.809
and David and I
as Jesus' gay dads.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.512
There's always room at our inn,
and she won't have

00:11.545 --> 00:13.347
to give birth in a barn
with a donkey watching.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.815
Although I can't explain why

00:14.848 --> 00:16.684
the Virgin also has an adorable
ten-year-old daughter.

00:16.717 --> 00:17.885
Because she's in her
second trimester,

00:17.918 --> 00:20.854
the only holiday gift Goldie
seems to want is food.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.656
As much and as often
as possible.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.926
She has to-- it's necessary
for the baby's development.

00:25.959 --> 00:28.096
But honestly? I think pregnancy
gives you a free pass

00:28.129 --> 00:29.497
to eat your feelings.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.365
If you're nervous or anxious,
have a burger.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.033
Feeling lonely?
Mac and cheese.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.070
Stressed?
Steak frites.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.905
Mmm.
So what's his excuse?

00:37.938 --> 00:39.607
Maybe he's stressed.
I mean, I certainly am.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.709
We're having a baby
in five months,

00:41.742 --> 00:43.111
so everything feels
overwhelming.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.245
And our meetings
with the baby proofer

00:44.278 --> 00:45.779
haven't exactly helped things.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.115
This is ridiculous.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.882
We really have to hire
somebody to teach us how

00:48.916 --> 00:51.719
to keep our child safe?
Our house isn't dangerous.
Bryan...

00:51.752 --> 00:52.920
Oh...

00:55.923 --> 00:58.592
Whoo! You see?
That's what happens to baby

00:58.626 --> 01:00.060
when you don't have a baby gate.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.395
Next, the pool.

01:01.429 --> 01:05.233
Or as I like to call it, "the
solar-powered water casket."

01:05.266 --> 01:07.568
BRYAN:
Everything just feels
so stressful lately.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.437
And I'm not saying
I deal with it perfectly,

01:09.470 --> 01:12.106
but I've developed a method of
coping that is tried and true.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.942
One for me and one for Goldie.

01:14.975 --> 01:16.410
Oh, no, I'm pregnant.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.978
I'm on call.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.413
I'm a child.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.615
And I'm in luck.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.789
I think they use these
for adults, too.
Right?

01:28.822 --> 01:31.091
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What is this?

01:31.125 --> 01:32.260
They're corner cushions.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.328
So that when baby falls,
his head will be safe.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.264
Oh, they're just so wrong.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.998
It's like traditional-colored
Band-Aids on Don Cheadle.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.300
Why do we need these?

01:39.333 --> 01:41.435
Baby-proofing isn't about
aesthetics, Bryan.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.103
It is about
protecting our child.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.605
This is leather.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.839
I took Carla
around the house,

01:45.873 --> 01:49.443
and it is like a toddler
Temple of Doom around here.

01:49.477 --> 01:52.112
First rule of daddyhood,
there are certain things that

01:52.146 --> 01:54.348
you may have to give up
for the safety of baby

01:54.382 --> 01:56.284
even if it makes you
uncomfortable.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.085
And, as your
baby concierge,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.154
it's my job to help
guide you through it.

02:00.188 --> 02:01.655
Why on the frame?

02:01.689 --> 02:03.123
What, is the baby
a giant now?

02:03.157 --> 02:04.625
Why can't we use
the baby-proofing style that

02:04.658 --> 02:07.461
my mother used, which was "Don't
set foot in here or else."

02:07.495 --> 02:09.497
The "Or else" being
the baby-proofing part.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.964
David, what did we just say?

02:10.998 --> 02:14.302
Do you know that the home is
where 99% of all babies die?

02:14.335 --> 02:16.804
Oh, look, your little guy's
taking his first steps.

02:16.837 --> 02:17.971
What a beautiful moment.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.973
Quick, honey, get
the camera. Bam!

02:20.007 --> 02:22.476
There goes his eyeball
across the floor.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.011
Blood gushing everywhere.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.979
Guess what? No chance
at being a jeweler

02:26.013 --> 02:27.315
or a military sniper.

02:27.348 --> 02:30.384
Parents must make sacrifices
for baby's safety.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.786
And we will.
I am completely on board

02:32.820 --> 02:34.855
with things like the pool cover
and the fence,

02:34.888 --> 02:36.690
but aren't you being
a little overdramatic?

02:36.724 --> 02:38.692
I mean, our baby's not even
gonna be toddling

02:38.726 --> 02:40.060
for another year and half.

02:40.093 --> 02:43.197
How about this one? I lean over
to kiss our beautiful baby,

02:43.231 --> 02:44.632
contact pops out
in the mouth,

02:44.665 --> 02:46.367
I'm half-blind,
the baby's choking to death.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.968
All right,
this is too much for me.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.370
I have to go to the bathroom.
What's this, Papa?

02:49.403 --> 02:51.505
Something I can play with.
Oh, this looks like fun.
(grunts)

02:51.539 --> 02:53.006
Oh, God! Oh, that could
totally happen!

02:53.040 --> 02:54.542
That image is never gonna
leave my head.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.378
Papa, hardcover books.
Will you please read to me...?

02:57.411 --> 02:58.712
Those are old and expensive!
Oh...

02:58.746 --> 03:01.014
Oh, and who wouldn't want
their skull crushed

03:01.048 --> 03:03.016
by the sardonic musings
of Chelsea Handler?

03:03.050 --> 03:04.017
Well worth it.

03:04.051 --> 03:05.686
Stop. I have to pee.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.422
No more hardcovers, Bry.
Only paperbacks.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.858
(sighs)

03:16.129 --> 03:17.265
Why is the toilet locked?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.699
It's a potty clamp.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.735
You'd be shocked at how many
toddlers are annually concussed

03:21.769 --> 03:25.105
as they reach in
to wash their little
hands in the poo-poo soup.

03:25.138 --> 03:26.240
How do I open it?

03:26.274 --> 03:27.875
Just press in,
twist right,

03:27.908 --> 03:29.443
tap-tap left
and lift.

03:29.477 --> 03:31.044
It's so cinch-y.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.246
I know it's all new, sweetie,

03:32.280 --> 03:34.948
but you'll get used to it.
This is our life now.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.587
It's okay!
I figured it out!

03:39.620 --> 03:40.721
Oh, that was easy.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.723
Tonight, I will drink
to forget this.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.558
(zipper rasps)

03:44.592 --> 03:46.260
I love Christmas!

03:46.294 --> 03:49.263
It is my absolute
favorite time of year.

03:49.297 --> 03:50.464
The music, the pageantry

03:50.498 --> 03:52.700
and everyone's just
a little bit kinder,

03:52.733 --> 03:54.702
with a little more love
in their heart.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.069
Plus you get
to sit on

03:56.103 --> 03:58.038
a man's lap and tell him
what you want

03:58.071 --> 03:59.239
without anyone judging you.

03:59.273 --> 03:59.973
(chuckles)

04:00.007 --> 04:01.241
Look at this one, Nana.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.743
It's got the
three wise men on it.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.745
You can even see
the frankincense,

04:04.778 --> 04:05.913
the myrrh and the gold.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.581
Oh, it's beautiful.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.950
Do you know that back in Ohio,

04:09.983 --> 04:12.620
I knew a man
named Abraham Wiseman?

04:12.653 --> 04:13.921
And don't you know it?

04:13.954 --> 04:15.589
He bought and sold gold, too.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.624
And...?

04:16.657 --> 04:18.659
Silver, I suppose.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.629
Yeah.

04:21.662 --> 04:24.998
(quietly):
So, uh, what is
the deal with...?

04:25.032 --> 04:28.101
Did another Kennedy pass away?

04:28.135 --> 04:30.804
No, this happens
every Christmas.
She's "eggnog nice."

04:30.838 --> 04:32.840
Something about the combo
of rum and cream

04:32.873 --> 04:35.609
makes her all, you know,
um, rummy and creamy.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.010
This one's beautiful.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.111
Good eye, Shania.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.481
That is 19th century
mercury glass from Poland.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.450
And that'll be going
right back in the box.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.584
No, David,
that my favorite ornament.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.952
It's from my grandmother.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.855
And I love Granny.
It's just we can't hang
glass ornaments

04:47.888 --> 04:50.190
six inches off the
floor with a baby
crawling around.

04:50.223 --> 04:53.160
We might as well hang
razor blades and shotgun shells.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.496
Ornaments are essential
to Christmas.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.131
They're like chestnuts
roasting on an open fire.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.801
Nuts. Oh, my God, our baby
could have nut allergies.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.503
Okay, we got to get rid
of all the nuts.

05:02.536 --> 05:03.704
No, Bryan, don't worry.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.540
You can hang them when
your baby's Shania's age.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.042
Sorry.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.811
Or maybe a little later.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.481
Did you guys make this
gingerbread house?

05:13.514 --> 05:15.349
Oh, it was a present
from one of my patients.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.150
*
I love gingerbread houses.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.219
It's so cool
to think about a place

05:19.252 --> 05:20.988
that you can eat,
but also live in.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.323
Aw, imagine waking up and taking
a bite of your pillow.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.659
I've been there.
Yeah. What?

05:25.693 --> 05:27.160
You know, David, I am not
the least bit surprised

05:27.194 --> 05:29.196
that one of your
patients made you

05:29.229 --> 05:31.499
such a thoughtful gift.
You are a wonderful doctor.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.333
BRYAN:
Do they make
eggnog year-round?

05:33.367 --> 05:35.669
'Cause I want
to get her some more.

05:35.703 --> 05:39.006
Oh, no! Santa's gonna have
to find another way in.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.575
Oh, like a pregnant Godzilla.

05:41.609 --> 05:42.743
Mmm!

05:42.776 --> 05:44.077
(growls a la Godzilla)

05:44.111 --> 05:46.079
How many glasses
of wine is that?

05:46.113 --> 05:47.214
You've been
drinking since noon.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.348
Yeah, and you've been remodeling

05:48.382 --> 05:50.418
that gingerbread house
with your mouth.

05:50.451 --> 05:53.186
And that's okay
'cause it's the holidays,

05:53.220 --> 05:54.855
and we're having a good time.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.324
Hey, Jane, how about a little
holiday cheer

05:57.357 --> 05:59.427
from your holiday queer?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.261
(chuckles)
You're a riot.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.030
I want to preserve
this Jane forever.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.866
Hey, Jane, my Realtor, Nancy
Niles, broker to the stars,

06:05.899 --> 06:08.436
she's having her holiday party.
You want to be my date?

06:08.469 --> 06:09.437
What about David?

06:09.470 --> 06:10.938
I don't go
to his Hollywood parties.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.606
I'm sick of
people's eyes

06:12.640 --> 06:14.875
glazing over when they find out
I'm only a doctor.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.411
And there's too much
baby-proofing to do.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.212
I mean, look at this.
Stockings within reach?

06:19.246 --> 06:20.881
Uh-uh. What if a baby
gets a hold of this?

06:20.914 --> 06:23.216
The only thing it's gonna
be filled with is tragedy.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.853
I guess that's why
Santa never had any kids.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.220
That we know of.

06:27.254 --> 06:29.289
Goldie, Shania, do you want
to come to this party?

06:29.322 --> 06:32.059
We'd love to, but we're
staying home to watch

06:32.092 --> 06:34.061
BOTH:
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

06:34.094 --> 06:37.064
Yeah, someone has a crush
on Yukon Cornelius.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.231
DAVID:
Aw.

06:38.265 --> 06:40.067
It's me!
Claymation redheads are hot.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.502
God, I hate
pregnancy hormones.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.905
Well, Jane, looks like you
and me are the only ones
with holiday spirit.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.907
I'll drink to that.

06:49.109 --> 06:50.944
Somebody needs
a refill.
Bryan...

06:50.978 --> 06:52.746
David, it's just
a tiny splash.

06:52.780 --> 06:53.914
Splash.

06:53.947 --> 06:56.484
(TV playing)
Mistletoe?

06:56.517 --> 06:58.786
How'd this get in here?
You want me to hang it off me?

06:58.819 --> 07:00.287
You're cute.
Not tonight, sweetie.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.956
What? The only
other time you've
rejected me was

07:02.990 --> 07:06.159
when you were passed out
from wisdom tooth surgery.

07:06.193 --> 07:07.961
And full disclosure,
you eventually gave in.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.631
Well, full disclosure,

07:10.664 --> 07:12.132
I don't like to fool around
when you've been drinking.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.601
It feels like
you don't mean it.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.435
We're men,
that's the beauty.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.970
We don't always
have to mean it.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.272
(turns off TV)
Okay, I'm gonna say it:

07:19.306 --> 07:22.275
I think you've been
drinking too much.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.310
And not just tonight.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.345
It's been six nights a week,
sometimes seven.

07:25.378 --> 07:26.346
You've been counting.

07:26.379 --> 07:27.781
Yes, because I'm concerned.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.517
It feels like it's gotten
out of hand.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.652
I've had dinner meetings almost
every night this week.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.488
You try sitting across
from Vanessa Redgrave

07:34.522 --> 07:36.356
as she recounts
her trip to Palestine.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.125
How am I supposed
to get though these

07:38.158 --> 07:39.960
monotonous work events
without a cocktail?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.795
I don't know.
Order a glass of water

07:41.829 --> 07:43.997
and zone out on
someone's bad outfit
like everyone else?

07:44.031 --> 07:45.465
I tried that tonight
with Goldie.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.534
It wasn't enough.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.769
You know why?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.704
You've been rigid
with me about everything

07:50.738 --> 07:53.006
concerning the baby, and
it makes me anxious.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.975
And it makes me anxious
that I feel like

07:55.008 --> 07:57.044
I have to look after
our child and for you.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.879
That's why I've been
counting the nights
you've been drinking.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.981
Well, I've been counting, too.

08:01.014 --> 08:04.117
Calories. And there
were, like, 25,000

08:04.151 --> 08:05.653
in that gingerbread
house tonight.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.487
Goldie ate the chimney.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.657
You know what?
I was gonna give this to you

08:09.690 --> 08:11.158
as a stocking stuffer
for Christmas,

08:11.191 --> 08:13.527
but now seems like a good time.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.666
A gift certificate
to Soul Cycle?

08:18.699 --> 08:21.168
You're just retaliating because
I've put on a few pounds.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.136
(turns on TV)
No, David, that is
a supportive nudge,

08:23.170 --> 08:25.539
because I'm concerned about my
partner's health, just like you.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.843
Oh, and we will be
removing the cactus garden.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.012
Having a baby in
a cactus garden is like...

08:32.045 --> 08:33.581
You know what?
I don't need an analogy.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.183
It's like having a baby
in a cactus garden.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.585
Absolutely not.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.820
I have spent three years
cultivating the perfect garden.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.354
I'll pay Diego extra
to stand guard.

08:41.388 --> 08:42.690
The cactuses are going, Bryan.

08:42.723 --> 08:45.025
The cacti will stay.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.060
I guess we'll just have
to agree to disagree.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.729
I couldn't agree more.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.401
David, crumbs in the bed?

09:00.574 --> 09:03.410
BRYAN:
Yeah. Hey, happy holidays!

09:03.443 --> 09:05.713
Hi. Hey, how are ya?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.180
His wife is cheating on him.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.850
Hey, you,
I remember your name.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.418
That's what
I'm looking for.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.886
Here we go, Jane.
Thank you.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.623
She has a bar
in her house?

09:15.656 --> 09:17.625
An oasis in
a snowy desert.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.760
To, uh, to getting
out of the house.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.361
In my case,
the hotel.
Mm-hmm.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.231
Wow, she got all this just from
selling real estate?
Mm-hmm.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.100
There he is! Bryan Collins,
my favorite client.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.135
Oh, mwa, mwa!
Mwa, mwa!

09:28.168 --> 09:30.738
Nancy Niles,
Realtor to the stars,

09:30.771 --> 09:33.106
Jane Forrest, long story.

09:33.140 --> 09:33.907
Welcome.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.408
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.576
The house looks amazing.

09:36.610 --> 09:37.745
Thank you.
Amazing.

09:37.778 --> 09:38.912
When did you put in the pool?

09:38.946 --> 09:39.913
It's always been there.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.415
It just had a cover on it
to keep it safe

09:42.449 --> 09:44.918
for the grandkids.
Learned that the hard way.

09:44.952 --> 09:45.919
I'm joking!

09:45.953 --> 09:47.655
I'm joking.
Oh! (laughs)

09:47.688 --> 09:49.089
Ah, baby-proofing,

09:49.122 --> 09:50.423
that's the world that David
and I are in right now.

09:50.457 --> 09:53.460
A baby?
Oh, sweetie, congratulations.
Thank you.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.295
Oh, there's Justin Bieber.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.164
I've been trying
to guilt him into getting

09:57.197 --> 09:58.598
his mother a better beach house.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.499
Yes.
I'll be back.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.434
I thought it was
Hilary Swank.

10:01.468 --> 10:05.338
She was about as genuine
as the bosoms on that girl.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.975
I'm so sick of this
baby-proofing stuff.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.276
Oh, then don't do it.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.679
All you need to control
a kid is an icy tone,

10:11.712 --> 10:13.647
a pursed lip
and a squinted eye.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.315
You don't have
to give up anything at all.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.785
I didn't give up
a single thing for my daughter.

10:17.818 --> 10:21.121
You haven't talked to
her in 17 years, huh?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.856
Oh, no, thanks.

10:22.890 --> 10:26.459
One glass of mid-priced
champagne is my limit.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.962
Plus David's been on me
about my drinking.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.664
Oh, that's just insane.

10:30.698 --> 10:33.200
In my day,
everybody drank all the time

10:33.233 --> 10:34.534
and it was
perfectly acceptable.

10:34.567 --> 10:37.971
You went to lunch,
you had a couple of
Harvey Wallbangers

10:38.005 --> 10:39.506
and then you napped
until Cronkite.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.841
No regrets, huh?

10:40.874 --> 10:44.144
No. I'm exactly where
I want to be.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.980
Really?
Living in a hotel,

10:47.014 --> 10:50.150
no jobs, following Goldie
and Shania around all day?

10:50.183 --> 10:51.719
That's not all I'm doing.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.722
I started a Twitter account,
I'm taking classes.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.656
I'm trying to establish
my brand.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.525
You have no idea
how hard it is

10:58.558 --> 11:00.660
to break into
the real estate market in LA.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.229
Because you have
this crazy notion

11:02.262 --> 11:03.897
that you're going to
go back to Ohio.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.533
Jane, if you're
gonna be here...

11:06.566 --> 11:07.901
be here.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.873
You don't understand.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.344
It's too scary for me.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.678
Look at that.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.980
Look at that big city.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.182
There are 12 million

11:22.215 --> 11:25.018
multicultural
gay-bi-straight

11:25.052 --> 11:27.354
liberal tofu lovers

11:27.387 --> 11:29.056
who wear short pants to work.

11:29.923 --> 11:32.692
How do I fit into that?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.728
Where do I even begin?

11:36.730 --> 11:39.900
You pick a spot,

11:39.933 --> 11:41.701
you plant your seed,

11:41.735 --> 11:43.737
and you watch it grow.

11:50.577 --> 11:53.580
That is some
extremely gay advice.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.219
MAN (on TV):
Oh, my dear sir!

11:59.252 --> 12:00.553
You know my assistant, Alfred,
Mr. Macy?

12:00.587 --> 12:01.922
There we go.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.257
Merry Christmas, Alfred.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.559
I can't stand
to see them suffer.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.795
Kill me.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.562
Oh, I want to.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.231
But there's enough death
in this house already.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.733
Did you know that
poinsettias and hollies

12:13.767 --> 12:15.769
are actually poisonous
to dogs and children?

12:15.803 --> 12:17.270
Really?

12:17.304 --> 12:18.438
Plus, Bryan reminded me

12:18.471 --> 12:20.407
that I might be
overdoing it a little.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.909
Mm. Me, too.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.643
You know, being pregnant

12:23.676 --> 12:25.445
gives me this great
excuse to eat.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.247
And?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.916
Oh. And nothing.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.083
It's completely awesome.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.252
The more I eat,
the bigger this baby gets.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.088
And you know, actually,
I am a little worried.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.957
It goes in so small,
and it comes out so big.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.758
From the same place.

12:38.792 --> 12:41.761
Maybe we should cut down on
the cookies a little bit.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.430
Deal.
Yeah.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.766
Maybe we could just split one?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.135
Yeah, it is
the holidays.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.136
I mean, who's it gonna hurt?

12:49.169 --> 12:50.603
Mom, can I have another cookie?

12:50.637 --> 12:51.671
I don't know, baby.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.106
You've already
had quite a few.

12:53.140 --> 12:55.475
Come on.
Who does it hurt?

12:55.508 --> 12:56.844
And could I get
another tiny splash?

12:56.877 --> 13:00.113
How am I supposed to think
without another drink?

13:00.147 --> 13:02.149
Forget it.
I'll just nurse this one.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.451
This is bad.
Yeah.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.119
We're modeling bad behavior.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.620
I mean, Bryan and I

13:07.654 --> 13:09.689
have been baby-proofing
this house to protect our son,

13:09.722 --> 13:11.959
but we need to
baby-proof ourselves,

13:11.992 --> 13:14.127
to protect him from
our bad behavior.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.929
Nana was so strict
with me growing up.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.630
It was always,
"No, no, no, Goldie."

13:17.664 --> 13:20.333
So I think for all the times
she said no to me,

13:20.367 --> 13:22.669
I've said yes to myself,
too much.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.305
It's not helping me
or my daughter.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.141
Sometimes,
I have to say no, too.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.309
No, Goldie.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.211
We need to cut down
on the bad foods.

13:31.244 --> 13:33.046
I'm starting right now,
with our pantry.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.651
Just... first have to figure out
how the child locks work.

13:38.685 --> 13:41.521
So, your first
big Hollywood party.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.656
What did you think?
It was wonderful.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.525
Although when you
went to the bathroom,

13:45.558 --> 13:48.061
I got pinned up against the wall
by that Oliver Stone.

13:48.095 --> 13:51.064
Oh.
Why is it that all
those left-wing commies

13:51.098 --> 13:52.665
have such terrible dandruff?

13:52.699 --> 13:54.701
Well, I'm glad you got to meet
our realtor, Nancy Niles.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.703
I didn't like her.
Oh, well, that's too bad.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.505
I was gonna see about getting
you a job interview with her.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.074
Well, in that case,
let me finish my sentence here.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.343
I didn't like her,
I loved her.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.679
You would do that for me?

14:06.713 --> 14:07.747
Yeah.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.682
Thank you, Bryan.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.418
(siren whoops)
Oh, no.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.020
Sobriety checkpoint ahead.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.021
What do I do?

14:14.054 --> 14:15.355
Okay, just relax.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.856
I mean, I've been drinking.

14:16.890 --> 14:19.359
I had a glass of champagne
and a piece of cake, rum cake.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.860
You only had a tiny splash.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.529
Oh, my God,
I'm a quasi-public figure

14:22.562 --> 14:23.830
who's about to become a father.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.232
I can't get a DUI, Jane.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.267
Don't be ridiculous.
George Bush got a DUI

14:27.300 --> 14:28.735
and he still got
elected President.

14:28.768 --> 14:31.271
Evening, officer.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.672
Evening.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.574
So where we been tonight,
a little party?

14:34.607 --> 14:36.376
Oh, yes.
We were at a wonderful party.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.411
And now we're
headed straight home.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.948
You know, you boys in blue
do a hell of a job.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.115
Sir.
Yes.

14:42.149 --> 14:43.116
Have you been drinking?

14:43.150 --> 14:45.618
I have had drinks in the past.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.255
In the spirit of full
disclosure, he did have

14:48.288 --> 14:51.224
a tiny little drink.
Tiny.

14:51.258 --> 14:53.927
(laughing)
Pull over.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.431
Okay, Mr. Collins.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.934
Please recite the
alphabet backwards.
(Jane sighs heavily)

15:00.968 --> 15:03.436
Z, Y, W...

15:03.470 --> 15:05.605
Honestly, I couldn't
even do this if I was sober.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.807
Which I am!
I am sober. I am sober.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.076
Which is why I can't do it.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.244
Look, I had like a demi-glass
of wine like two hours ago.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.812
I'm totally fine.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.847
If I was drunk,
could I do this?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.419
JANE:
Okay.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.453
Bryan, know your rights.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.454
Ma'am, get back
in that car.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.922
You... know your rights.
Jane, just...

15:22.956 --> 15:25.492
Jane, just listen.
You do not have
to participate

15:25.525 --> 15:28.095
in an illegal witch hunt
by this Stasi-like regime.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.762
Jane, listen to the man
with the gun.
Know your rights.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.264
Oh, please. I have a gun, too.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.599
Gun! Gun! Down!

15:32.632 --> 15:34.101
She's joking! She's joking!
I am protected by

15:34.134 --> 15:36.269
my Second Amendment rights!
Get your hands on the ground.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.470
I'm getting down, sir.
All the way down!

15:37.504 --> 15:39.139
I was getting down.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.407
I cannot get
all the way down, sir,

15:40.440 --> 15:41.541
this is a very expensive suit.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.282
Oh, hey, very nice.
Look at you.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.684
You covered the cord
and secured the base.

15:51.718 --> 15:52.852
Thank you.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.954
You are a baby-proofing
monster, Dave.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.457
I'm talking
borderline fanatical.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.659
Oh, sweet God, no.

16:01.694 --> 16:04.297
A rusty ornament with
pre-war toxic paint?

16:04.331 --> 16:07.134
I'm sorry, but this
death-tree's coming down.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.502
The baby isn't due
until way after Christmas,

16:09.536 --> 16:11.638
so, I think it's okay

16:11.671 --> 16:13.506
if he keeps his ornaments
this year.
No.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.142
It's okay, we can
take 'em all down.
Yeah.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.543
Maybe I can keep
the star on top?

16:16.576 --> 16:18.311
Oh, that's a good idea.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.979
Hey, what's that
rumbling sound? Oh, no!

16:20.013 --> 16:22.649
It's an earthquake!
The tree just fell over!

16:22.682 --> 16:25.185
And the pointy star just impaled
Junior right in the skull!

16:25.218 --> 16:27.487
Happy worst Christmas ever!

16:27.520 --> 16:29.189
Okay, that's enough, Carla.
Let's go this way.
Uh-huh.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.657
Off to the laundry room.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.693
Or as I like to call it, "the
giant metal baby coffin room."

16:37.364 --> 16:40.167
Bryan, when the police stopped
you and Nana the other night,

16:40.200 --> 16:41.901
how come they
didn't arrest you?

16:41.934 --> 16:44.337
Well, your nana's lucky
that the police aren't concerned

16:44.371 --> 16:45.872
about old white women with guns.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.707
And I wasn't drunk,
but I had

16:47.740 --> 16:50.377
been drinking, and I should not
have been behind the wheel.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.712
I made a bad choice.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.181
I'm gonna be somebody's dad,
Shania.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.083
I can't afford
to make mistakes like that.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.518
I know what I have to do.

17:01.721 --> 17:02.855
What are you doing?

17:02.889 --> 17:04.091
Bryan-proofing.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.693
Making sure that my baby
is safe in this home.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.161
Don't be so hard on yourself.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.097
You're a good person, Bryan.
You're just stressed.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.264
Of course I'm stressed.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.432
My whole life is about
to change.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.767
So? What's so bad about that?

17:14.801 --> 17:18.037
You didn't know me when I was
a kid, but I worried, too.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.206
A lot.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.440
Yeah? About what?

17:20.473 --> 17:22.709
I worried my dad would keep
forgetting about us,

17:22.742 --> 17:25.078
that my mom wouldn't be loved
the way she deserves,

17:25.112 --> 17:27.214
that I'd never get
to know more of the world

17:27.247 --> 17:28.715
than the neighborhood
where I was born.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.218
And now, everything's changed,
and it's awesome.

17:31.251 --> 17:33.052
But I'm not you.
I don't know

17:33.086 --> 17:34.387
if I'll be able to adjust

17:34.421 --> 17:36.089
to all this change
that the baby's gonna bring.

17:36.123 --> 17:38.891
I'm still trying to adjust from
Kellogg's changing the name

17:38.925 --> 17:40.627
of Sugar Smacks to Honey Smacks.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.729
Maybe you don't see yourself
how I see you.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.632
Five months ago, you probably
didn't think you'd be spending

17:45.665 --> 17:48.301
Christmas with me, my mom,
my dad and my nana.

17:48.335 --> 17:52.605
But here we are, a part of your
lives, a part of your family.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.443
Let me buy you
a drink, kid.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.113
Okay, but I have to warn you,

18:00.147 --> 18:03.116
after two lemonades,
I'm a living terror.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.485
So, you were quite
the realtor in Ohio.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.154
Well, not to brag,

18:07.187 --> 18:09.456
but I did win
Realtor of the Year Award

18:09.489 --> 18:10.957
from the Bowling Green
Chamber of Commerce.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.759
Oh, I don't consider that
bragging.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.263
And I don't care what you
did in Ohio. This is LA.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.998
We only care about Ohio
during presidential elections.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.433
What have you
done here?

18:20.467 --> 18:23.170
Um, I've been
establishing my brand.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.604
Meaning what, you started

18:24.637 --> 18:28.141
a MySpace account or
something? (laughs)

18:28.175 --> 18:30.109
What do you want from me,
Mrs. Forrest?

18:30.143 --> 18:32.279
A chance.

18:32.312 --> 18:36.449
I want to give up what I had in
Ohio for something better here.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.618
Yeah, well, what you need
to give up is

18:38.651 --> 18:39.852
that 1980s Mervyn's power suit

18:39.886 --> 18:42.522
in the staggering
jewel tone. Ugh.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.823
You know, Jane,

18:43.856 --> 18:45.525
when I look at you,
I see myself.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.528
Ten years ago when I lost
my husband and my way.

18:48.561 --> 18:51.164
I see a lot
of the old me in you.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.832
And I don't like it.

18:52.865 --> 18:56.002
I don't want you running around
my office, reminding me of what

18:56.035 --> 18:59.472
a completely...
unevolved creature that I was.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.708
And I don't like

19:01.741 --> 19:03.042
being where I'm not wanted.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.478
I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.314
Oh, yes.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.049
And, uh, speaking of waste,

19:10.082 --> 19:13.986
I mentioned to Bryan that
his house is in an HPOZ zone.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.388
Under the Mills Act,

19:15.422 --> 19:18.525
he would be entitled to a huge
reduction in property taxes.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.393
He said you never
pointed that out.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.894
I told him I'd let you know.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.162
(laughs)

19:23.196 --> 19:24.731
That's very smart,

19:24.764 --> 19:28.668
very informed and vaguely
undercutting of me.

19:28.701 --> 19:31.871
Now you're reminding me of
myself in a way that I like.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.506
Come on, Jane,
sit back down.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.008
Now, if... if we're going
to move forward with this,

19:36.042 --> 19:37.377
you need to know

19:37.410 --> 19:40.680
that the LA real estate market
is not Ohio.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.715
There are days when you
are going to have to be

19:42.749 --> 19:46.018
a balls out,
take-no-prisoners bitch.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.054
Now, you think you
can do that, Jane?

19:48.087 --> 19:49.889
I can try.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.391
Good.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.731
(panting)

19:58.765 --> 20:01.067
298, 299.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.869
Come on, don't think
about rotisserie chicken.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.371
Come on!
(groans)

20:04.404 --> 20:07.073
Aah. I was going
for three sets of 20,

20:07.106 --> 20:09.075
but it's a start.
Honey, you don't need
to do that.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.710
You look great.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.345
Besides, I don't want
to be held responsible

20:12.379 --> 20:14.247
for anybody's low body
self-image, except my own.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.115
Oh, you were right.

20:16.148 --> 20:19.586
Those cookies were
making me tired and foggy.
And cranky.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.454
I'm assuming. Were
they? I don't know.
(laughs)

20:23.590 --> 20:25.392
I shouldn't have been
so hard on you.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.059
No. I think it's good that
we do that for each other.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.561
Who else is going to remind us

20:28.595 --> 20:30.229
of our many, many
tragic shortcomings

20:30.263 --> 20:32.632
except for each other?
You mean besides our mothers?

20:32.665 --> 20:33.866
You know, it's funny. I think

20:33.900 --> 20:35.101
that psycho baby concierge
kind of nailed it.

20:35.134 --> 20:36.202
There are just
certain things

20:36.235 --> 20:37.304
we're gonna
have to give up,

20:37.337 --> 20:38.705
even if they make
us uncomfortable.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.640
Yeah, because look what
we're going to get in return.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.776
Which reminds me...

20:43.810 --> 20:46.045
I have something
to show you.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.547
Tell me what it is.
No, don't tell me what it is.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.115
I hate when you ruin surprises.
But tell me what it is.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.653
Oh, David, you did all this?

20:53.686 --> 20:56.289
Took a little hunting,
but all of the ornaments

20:56.323 --> 20:57.624
are baby-proof.

20:57.657 --> 21:01.060
Made with organic fabrics
and natural woods.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.595
And made by highly-paid,

21:02.629 --> 21:05.965
unionized adult American elves.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.834
Oh, I hate them.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.337
I really do.
I hate them all.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.939
Really? All of them?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.974
Even this one?

21:18.678 --> 21:21.681
Well, that one...
that one I love.

21:21.714 --> 21:29.822
Makes all the other
hideous ones worth it.
