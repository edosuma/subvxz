Oh, apparently, a woman
from the cleaning crew

10:26.974 --> 10:28.453
lost her damn mind
last night.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.542
She claimed a black blob
tried to choke her

10:30.586 --> 10:31.805
and then escaped through
an air vent.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.371
A black blob?I mean, obviously,

10:33.415 --> 10:35.591
she was having some sort of
nervous breakdown or something.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.506
Right.

10:37.549 --> 10:38.855
I'll see you later?

10:38.899 --> 10:40.944
Yeah.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.223
BRIAN:
I'm so glad she called me.

10:59.267 --> 11:00.442
This doesn't mean we're
back together, okay?

11:00.485 --> 11:02.966
It's 'cause I'm having
a rough day.

11:03.010 --> 11:06.883
It's... it's like a
stress release, you know?Yeah. Mm-hmm.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.319
Yeah, we're
just friends.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.191
Yeah.Totally stress releasing, right?

11:10.234 --> 11:12.149
BRIAN:
Whoo! I love afternoon sex.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.368
Hey, we're still broken up.

11:13.411 --> 11:14.804
Okay?
Yeah.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.066
Friends helping friends.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.372
I'm cool.
Okay.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.592
BRIAN:
God, I love her boobs.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.638
Boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs,
boobs, boobs, boobs.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.770
Oh, no.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.206
What's wrong?

11:25.249 --> 11:26.207
I just want to get on top.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.251
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Okay.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.951
BRIAN: Oh, man,
why'd she have to get on top?

11:30.994 --> 11:32.430
Hang in there, Bri.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.215
Just think about Nana Patty.

11:34.258 --> 11:37.479
Mm. Yeah, yeah, Nana-Nana Patty had that giant chin mole.

11:39.481 --> 11:41.352
Uh, don't look at her boobs.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.662
More stuff.
Uh, broccoli farts,

11:46.706 --> 11:48.055
ugly babies,

11:48.098 --> 11:49.360
World Series winners.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.145
World Series winners
in reverse order.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.147
Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.149
Mm, she's so hot.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.978
That was fun.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.936
Yeah. Yeah, so fun.

12:04.593 --> 12:08.075
Maybe, uh, we can chill
later, just as friends?

12:08.118 --> 12:10.773
Yeah, sure.

12:14.081 --> 12:16.736
BRIAN: I love her so much,
I have to get her back.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.523
Hopefully soon, unless you're
too busy detecting, Detective.

12:21.566 --> 12:22.611
NIKO:
Well, I wasn't sure

12:22.654 --> 12:23.830
if we're back together
like before,

12:23.873 --> 12:25.005
'cause then I'll
bring over subs for lunch.

12:25.048 --> 12:27.572
Or are we starting
from square one?

12:27.616 --> 12:30.358
'Cause then I will text you
and ask you out,

12:30.401 --> 12:33.361
and nervously watch the
dot-dot-dots for your response.

12:33.404 --> 12:35.058
Bring the subs.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.060
See you then.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.985
"Melly."

12:49.029 --> 12:51.814
Oh, my God.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.516
Harry?

12:58.560 --> 13:00.040
What are you doing here?

13:00.083 --> 13:02.956
Oh, I, uh...

13:02.999 --> 13:05.567
I just wiped this
poor woman's memory

13:05.610 --> 13:07.351
of a demon attack.
What are you doing here?

13:07.395 --> 13:10.093
Oh, I, uh, I heard about
what happened at the lab.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.313
Well, well, she's
obviously traumatized.

13:12.356 --> 13:15.620
The next step is to understand
precisely which demon did this.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.622
A companion of
Taydeus, perhaps.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.060
This demon could be
what's "begun."

13:20.103 --> 13:22.062
Did you hear any
specifics at the lab

13:22.105 --> 13:23.367
that could help us
narrow it down?

13:23.411 --> 13:25.587
No.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.023
No, sorry.

13:27.067 --> 13:29.373
Mm, too bad.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.550
Well, let me know if
you do hear anything.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.988
And let's check
back in later.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.598
Cheerio.

13:38.643 --> 13:41.342
God. My power
is officially the worst.

13:41.385 --> 13:43.213
I'm never gonna be able
to have sex again.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.130
What the hell are you doing?

13:47.174 --> 13:48.697
It's her. It's Mom.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.917
I'm asking questions
only she would know.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.701
About my first word,

13:52.744 --> 13:54.485
your weird attraction
to the green Teletubby

13:54.529 --> 13:56.009
in preschool...

13:56.052 --> 13:57.140
It's her spirit in there.

13:58.707 --> 14:01.971
I know you agree with Macy.You really think it's Mom?

14:10.023 --> 14:14.201
'Cause I'd really love
to talk to her right now.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.768
I know it's her.

14:20.468 --> 14:22.557
MACY:
What is going on?

14:22.600 --> 14:23.819
MAGGIE:
I'm sorry, Macy.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.386
Mom, are you there?

14:37.702 --> 14:39.313
MEL: I can't believe
you broke the board.

14:39.356 --> 14:42.925
I'm sorry. I was trying
to save Maggie from that thing.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.535
I think it was Mom's spirit.I know it was.

14:44.579 --> 14:45.536
She was trying to reach us.

14:45.580 --> 14:46.929
You had no right to do that!

14:46.973 --> 14:48.539
There must be a spell
to repair it.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.845
Mel, listen to me.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.673
There was another demon attack,

14:51.716 --> 14:53.153
a custodian
at the lab.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.632
I went to see her
at the hospital

14:54.676 --> 14:56.634
and Meghan Markle was there
wiping her memory.

14:56.678 --> 14:58.767
Yeah, to cover
his tracks, probably.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.944
Or because he's a Whitelighter
and that's his job.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.599
Look, I found a sample
of its residue,

15:04.642 --> 15:06.427
and I... I want
to show it to him.

15:06.470 --> 15:08.472
No way.
I don't trust him.

15:08.516 --> 15:11.432
Which is why we have this plan
to give him the truth serum.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.216
The way we all agreed.

15:13.260 --> 15:17.003
He drinks this, 30 minutes,
we know exactly where we stand.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.048
I'm starting to think that you
don't want it to be Mom.

15:20.789 --> 15:22.660
Or I'm just objective enough

15:22.704 --> 15:24.662
to know that
it can't possibly be.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.754
You had a horrible loss,

15:29.798 --> 15:32.888
you're grieving
and I'm sorry, but...

15:32.932 --> 15:34.455
It's different for me.

15:34.498 --> 15:37.588
You don't want to ask her
why she left you?

15:37.632 --> 15:38.981
I'm just not sure there's
anything she could say

15:39.025 --> 15:40.504
that would make it better.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.506
This whole sisterhood,

15:42.550 --> 15:45.379
Power of Three
thing, it's, um...

15:45.422 --> 15:50.036
It's really just you two and me,
the outsider.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.646
Macy, that's not true.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.474
NIKO:
Hey, who's hungry for

15:53.517 --> 15:55.693
a spicy Italian grinder?!Oh, God, Niko. Okay.

15:56.738 --> 15:59.001
In here!Enjoy your lunch.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.395
I'm going to figure out
if I can trust Meghan Markle.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.788
Hi, Maggie.
Hi, you must be Macy.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.183
Nice to meet you.Wow. Firm grip.

16:07.227 --> 16:08.924
I squeeze a lot
of stress balls.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.534
I was just leaving.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.710
Macy, wait.

16:12.754 --> 16:13.668
Is everything okay?

16:13.711 --> 16:15.887
More sisters, more drama.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.889
MAGGIE:
Oh.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.021
On that note,

16:19.065 --> 16:20.980
I will be leaving, too.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.982
There may be a way to fix...Mom's sewing machine.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.245
I'll check.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.944
You're taking up sewing?Yeah, I decided

16:28.988 --> 16:31.599
that not all domestic
tasks are oppressive.

16:34.167 --> 16:37.561
Ooh, you remembered
I like extra pickles.

16:37.605 --> 16:39.302
Yeah, it hasn't been that long.

16:39.346 --> 16:41.043
It's been too long for me.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.567
Mm.

16:43.611 --> 16:46.092
Hey, I got you
a little present.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.571
Just something
to let you know

16:47.615 --> 16:49.573
how happy I am
we're back together.

16:51.401 --> 16:53.751
No.

16:53.795 --> 16:56.450
The 1987 first pressing

16:56.493 --> 16:58.234
of The Cure's Kiss Me,
Kiss Me, Kiss Me.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.540
Still in the plastic.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.633
I have to get back
to the station.

17:05.676 --> 17:07.548
Well, that's all right.

17:07.591 --> 17:11.378
Just-just bring back the
handcuffs for later.

17:11.421 --> 17:11.943
Okay.

17:13.597 --> 17:15.599
Mmm.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.604
Hey, Mel.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.867
Yeah?

17:25.131 --> 17:28.482
Nothing, I'm just so happy.

17:28.525 --> 17:29.700
Me, too.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.922
I promise I'll get there
as soon as I can.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.271
Ah, don't stress.

17:35.315 --> 17:36.490
We already did
the extractions for you.

17:36.533 --> 17:37.839
Wait, what?

17:37.882 --> 17:39.188
That was my job.

17:39.232 --> 17:40.624
I-I know, but y-you
weren't here, so...

17:40.668 --> 17:42.496
I'll be there soon.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.801
What is going on in there?

17:43.845 --> 17:45.194
I can barely hear you.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.110
Remember that janitor
that freaked out

17:48.154 --> 17:50.069
in the lab the other day?

17:50.112 --> 17:51.548
She just died.

17:51.592 --> 17:53.681
What

17:53.724 --> 17:56.814
Sorry to keep you waiting.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.512
That's okay.

17:58.555 --> 17:59.904
The good news is

17:59.948 --> 18:02.342
I have found the Royal Doulton

18:02.385 --> 18:04.605
since you're so intent
on sharing a cuppa.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.088
TRIP:
Stop wasting our time.

18:09.131 --> 18:10.828
Two eyewitnesses I.D.'d you.

18:10.872 --> 18:13.788
You're looking at
20 years, minimum.

18:13.831 --> 18:16.617
Eyewitness testimony
is notoriously unreliable.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.401
Plus, those two idiots
were drunk.

18:18.445 --> 18:21.665
We have no case.
You're gonna walk.

18:23.493 --> 18:26.279
So, this demon--

18:26.322 --> 18:29.020
without evidence
left behind,

18:29.064 --> 18:30.239
it's hard to pin down.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.588
Taydeus could have associates.

18:31.632 --> 18:32.850
Did you bring The Book of Shadows?

18:32.894 --> 18:35.114
Uh, no. Don't you want your tea?

18:35.157 --> 18:36.550
Oh, yes.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.684
Ah, delicious.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.035
Mm, bit of an aftertaste,
though.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.650
MAGGIE:
Look, all I'm saying is

18:49.693 --> 18:51.391
I think we really hurt
Macy's feelings.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.828
We'll make it up to her.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.438
Let's just focus on
fixing this thing,

18:55.482 --> 18:57.875
so we can talk to Mom.

18:57.919 --> 19:01.183
Separate yolk from egg white
and anoint with saliva.

19:01.227 --> 19:04.360
Or instead, just kill me now
because that's so gross.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.929
Hold on.

19:07.972 --> 19:09.539
Hi.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.367
Hey, it's me.
I'm at work, but I have

19:11.411 --> 19:13.152
this overwhelming urge
to tell you how I really feel

19:13.195 --> 19:14.936
about something.Wait, what?

19:14.979 --> 19:16.894
I love you so much.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.593
And also, you're the
worst driver I've ever known.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.685
Oh, no.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.951
It's called personal space,
Moynahan.

19:29.994 --> 19:31.213
Respect it.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.301
I'm sorry.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.433
Come on, let's go.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.174
And Frank, I cannot translate

19:35.217 --> 19:36.958
the Mu Shu Palace
menu specials for you

19:37.001 --> 19:39.526
because I am not Chinese!

19:39.569 --> 19:42.616
These lenses are fake.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.792
I just wear them
so people take me seriously.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.010
Oh, God.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.448
I am hot!

19:48.491 --> 19:50.232
:
I don't know why
I try to hide it.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.755
Wait, why am I
talking so much?

19:51.799 --> 19:53.061
You'll be fine in a bit.

19:53.104 --> 19:54.802
I slept with Greta last week.

19:54.845 --> 19:56.630
Your ex

19:56.673 --> 19:58.719
Twice. I feel really
guilty about it.

19:58.762 --> 19:59.937
Are you kidding me?

19:59.981 --> 20:02.201
No. That's why I bought you
that Cure album.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.245
It was a guilt present.

20:03.289 --> 20:04.812
Yes, exactly.

20:04.855 --> 20:07.858
Maybe you should
give it to Greta then.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.730
See, this is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you.

20:09.773 --> 20:11.775
She was your fiancée.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.734
You were still
together when we met.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.649
And I left her for you.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.259
I'm allowed to have
feelings about this.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.782
Well, your version
of feelings

20:18.826 --> 20:20.044
usually means
shutting me out completely.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.003
I can't do that again, Mel.

20:22.046 --> 20:24.266
I love you,
but I won't do that again.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.493
Oh. It worked.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.410
Ugh.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.851
Not enough hand sanitizer
in the world.

21:04.045 --> 21:06.047
Oh, my God.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.659
Still no exclamation points.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.930
Everything is so hard, Mom.

21:21.845 --> 21:24.152
I wish you could help me.

21:34.075 --> 21:35.859
Release me?

21:37.078 --> 21:38.819
How?

21:38.862 --> 21:41.735
Guess what.

21:41.778 --> 21:43.998
Niko slept with Greta... twice.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.348
That sucks, but we don't
have time to unpack it.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.611
Mom can come back.
Her spirit.

21:48.655 --> 21:50.439
But we have to hurry.
Something about a...

21:50.483 --> 21:52.963
a lunar calendar,
or a lunatic.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.835
I don't know. I was keeping
track of a lot of letters.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.532
Let's go.
Macy's out.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.186
We have to do
this quickly.

21:58.229 --> 22:00.667
MEL/MAGGIE:
Ipsum revelare.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.582
Ipsum revelare.

22:02.625 --> 22:05.193
Ipsum revelare!

22:21.775 --> 22:24.168
MAGGIE:
Mom.

22:24.212 --> 22:27.171
Girls.

22:27.215 --> 22:29.217
Ah.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.403
Mom, it's you.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.057
You're really here.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.015
Oh, my God.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.366
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.498
I knew you were ready
to be the Charmed Ones.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.282
I have so many questions.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.328
:
And I need your help
with so many things.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.765
I was gonna tell you everything
that night to prepare you.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.245
I just didn't get the chance.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.334
Who did it, Mom?
Who killed you?

22:59.378 --> 23:00.901
Where's Macy?

23:00.944 --> 23:03.294
Where's your sister?
I need to speak with her.

23:03.338 --> 23:04.861
I only have a few hours.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.950
She was with our Whitelighter.
I texted her to come home.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.387
Harry?Mm-hmm.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.476
I warned you about Harry.

23:10.519 --> 23:12.303
He's the one who killed me.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.393
He wants to steal
your powers, and then

23:14.436 --> 23:16.220
he'll kill you, too.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.744
That's why I'm here.

23:21.487 --> 23:25.447
So, London must have changed
a lot since the '50s.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.275
You've asked me that already.

23:27.318 --> 23:29.364
Can we please stick
to the matter in hand?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.584
Have you ever met Meghan Markle?

23:31.627 --> 23:33.716
Macy, why the inane chitchat?

23:37.067 --> 23:40.070
Just one more question.

23:40.114 --> 23:42.899
Did you kill Janet?

23:42.943 --> 23:45.511
What is going on?
What are you

23:45.554 --> 23:47.164
and your sisters up to

23:48.644 --> 23:50.646
Oh, no.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.652
She's still not
answering my texts.

23:56.696 --> 23:58.698
What do we do

23:58.741 --> 24:01.048
The spirit board?

24:01.091 --> 24:04.355
What did you girls do?

24:04.399 --> 24:05.748
No.

24:07.054 --> 24:09.360
Macy?

24:16.803 --> 24:19.196
Mom?

24:21.111 --> 24:25.202
My brilliant,
beautiful daughter home at last.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.902
I can't believe
this is happening.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.079
:
Is this really happening?

24:32.122 --> 24:35.561
I never stopped dreaming
that I would see you again.

24:35.604 --> 24:39.782
Why did you leave me?It's a long story.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.480
Please tell me.
I need to hear it.
I will.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.004
I will tell you everything,
I promise.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.832
We just have
to get this Prism first.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.486
The Prism of Souls.
It's the only thing

24:47.529 --> 24:49.531
that can trap him
and protect you girls.

24:49.575 --> 24:51.315
He has it hidden somewhere.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.535
Okay.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.711
So, this-this Prism--
how do we find it?

24:55.755 --> 24:58.322
Well, it has to be hidden
behind a mirror,

24:58.366 --> 25:00.847
somewhere he could
keep an eye on it.

25:00.890 --> 25:03.458
He's using your old office.

25:03.502 --> 25:04.938
You had that antique mirror,
remember?

25:04.981 --> 25:06.374
It would be just like him

25:06.417 --> 25:08.550
to use something of mine.
Don't worry.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.204
I'll be here
when you get back.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.249
Okay.

25:19.779 --> 25:22.042
Why can't I tell
what you're feeling?

25:22.085 --> 25:23.434
I want to.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.306
I mean, that's-that's my power,

25:25.349 --> 25:27.090
reading minds, and...

25:27.134 --> 25:28.788
I can sense feelings
when I do it.

25:28.831 --> 25:31.225
Of course it is, with
your sense of empathy.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.836
But, baby, remember,
I'm not a person.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.185
I'm just a visiting spirit.

25:35.229 --> 25:37.840
I just wish you could stay.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.320
I wish that, too.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.675
I just wish that I'd known

25:46.719 --> 25:48.808
all of this when you were alive.

25:48.851 --> 25:50.157
I know,

25:50.200 --> 25:53.203
but that's not how
it was destined to be.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.292
MAGGIE:
Why would Harry

25:55.336 --> 25:56.990
have the one thing
that could trap him?

25:57.033 --> 25:58.295
So no one else can get it.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.864
Over here.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.609
MEL:
Let's see what that means.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.264
"The only way out
is together."

26:11.700 --> 26:13.528
I'm a scientist.

26:13.572 --> 26:16.531
I can read Latin.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.319
Whoa.

26:25.018 --> 26:26.585
So it's not behind
the mirror.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.456
It's inside it.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.765
MAGGIE:
Wait. Wait.

26:32.808 --> 26:34.201
But what if...?

26:34.244 --> 26:36.246
Guys?

26:49.825 --> 26:51.827
What the hell?

26:56.876 --> 26:58.268
Guys?

27:15.590 --> 27:17.070
Seriously, you guys.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.333
How do we get out of here?

27:22.771 --> 27:24.817
Like Mom said,
we find the Prism.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.601
Ah, maybe then
the way out will open back up.

27:32.607 --> 27:34.522
Wait.

27:34.565 --> 27:36.742
What's that?

27:36.785 --> 27:39.570
But that wasn't...

27:39.614 --> 27:41.790
There. This must be
what holds the Prism.

27:43.226 --> 27:45.751
How do we open it?

27:45.794 --> 27:47.100
Okay, there are three sides.

27:47.143 --> 27:49.189
Maybe we're the keys.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.760
Come on, Maggie.
We need your hand

27:54.803 --> 27:57.066
to unlock it.

27:58.981 --> 28:02.724
Wait. I'm sorry, but...
what if it's a trap?

28:02.768 --> 28:04.770
And it, like, sucks us inside
or something?

28:04.813 --> 28:07.294
Why would Mom send us here
if it was a trap?

28:07.337 --> 28:09.513
She wouldn't, unless
that wasn't really her.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.690
Look, when I touched her, I...MACY: She told you.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.213
It's because she's a spirit.

28:14.562 --> 28:16.695
We don't have time for this.

28:16.738 --> 28:18.784
Maggie, we decided
majority rules.

28:36.802 --> 28:38.760
See? No suckage.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.631
It wasn't a trap.

28:41.676 --> 28:42.982
Ooh.

28:43.025 --> 28:46.637
Big congrats, except
now we're trapped.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.161
Damn it.
My powers don't work in here.

28:49.945 --> 28:52.556
I think we came
through this one.No, it was this one over here.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.776
Wait. You guys, remember,
the only way out is together.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.561
I told you it wasn't that one!Right, like you knew.
You were guessing!

28:57.605 --> 28:59.738
Guys, here.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.528
The only way out...Is together.

29:13.229 --> 29:16.102
Maybe I should switch to
physics, because I'm pretty sure

29:16.145 --> 29:18.539
we just exited a parallel
dimension of the multiverse.

29:18.582 --> 29:21.542
Geek out later. We
don't have much time.

29:27.156 --> 29:28.854
Mom!

29:30.943 --> 29:33.119
Help me!

29:39.995 --> 29:41.692
Macy, help me!

29:44.434 --> 29:49.048
Listen, girls,
that's not your mother.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.963
They're not girls. They're
women. Women I'm very proud of.

29:51.006 --> 29:53.835
It's an Imposter Demon. It wants
to use the Prism to suck

29:53.879 --> 29:55.402
your powers.
That's what the Prism does.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.970
Enough of your theatrics, Harry.

29:58.013 --> 29:59.580
Macy, give me the Prism.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.974
No. No, no, don't.You can trust me.
I'm your mother.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.802
She's lying.Stop!

30:03.845 --> 30:05.673
Maggie?

30:05.716 --> 30:06.892
If you're really Mom,
then you'll know

30:06.935 --> 30:08.632
what I made you
in third grade art class.

30:08.676 --> 30:11.287
How could I forget? My
eight-year-old made me a bong.

30:11.331 --> 30:12.593
She got it right.

30:12.636 --> 30:13.681
Give it to her.

30:13.724 --> 30:14.725
HARRY: An Imposter
gets into your head.

30:14.769 --> 30:16.292
That's how it works.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.253
You really sure
it isn't her?

30:20.296 --> 30:21.863
Believe me,
I want it to be. But...

30:22.864 --> 30:24.692
...it's not. I can feel it.

30:24.735 --> 30:25.736
You guys are crazy.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.521
It's her. It has to be her.

30:27.564 --> 30:30.132
Mel, please, I'm your sister.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.917
This isn't something I normally
say, but I'm gonna say it.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.396
You have
to listen to me.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.485
MARISOL:
Trust yourself, Melly.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.487
Think about how close we were.

30:37.531 --> 30:40.316
It's always been you and me.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.413
Mel, don't.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.291
Mom would have never said that.

30:58.334 --> 30:59.814
She didn't play favorites.

31:02.904 --> 31:03.774
Careful, ladies,
she might...

31:14.524 --> 31:15.438
Macy!

31:26.188 --> 31:27.842
Harry, how do we kill
this thing?

31:27.886 --> 31:29.626
Expose the demon
to its true self

31:29.670 --> 31:31.367
and you'll vanquish it forever.

31:31.411 --> 31:33.021
Maybe without the poetics,
Lord Byron.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.762
Show the demon
its reflection in a mirror.

31:34.805 --> 31:35.894
More mirrors?

31:35.937 --> 31:37.243
Oh, but of course.

31:37.286 --> 31:39.114
All of yours broke
when you released the demon.

31:43.466 --> 31:46.078
Wait. Duh.

31:58.525 --> 32:01.006
Here.

32:01.049 --> 32:02.616
I got you.

32:08.796 --> 32:11.059
I really thought it was her.

32:11.103 --> 32:13.322
I did, too.

32:26.118 --> 32:29.121
Don't. You're not the first
to fall for an Imposter Demon.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.688
Let's just say I'm pretty sure
that's how Brexit happened.

32:31.732 --> 32:34.387
It's funny. They're
considered lower-level demons

32:34.430 --> 32:37.520
because their only real power
is emotional manipulation.

32:37.564 --> 32:41.785
In some ways, that makes
them the most lethal.

32:41.829 --> 32:45.485
And the most vulnerable to
a witch with your unique powers.

32:45.528 --> 32:49.054
Now who has
the cooler power?

32:49.663 --> 32:52.666
I wanted to hear her say
it was a mistake.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.189
Giving me up.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.061
But I should have
listened to you.

32:57.062 --> 32:57.976
I should have listened, too.

32:59.368 --> 33:01.109
I can be a know-it-all.I always think I'm right.

33:02.850 --> 33:06.071
:
Oh, my God.

33:06.114 --> 33:08.073
You guys are so much alike.

33:08.116 --> 33:10.989
Maybe you don't know each other
that well yet, but...

33:11.032 --> 33:13.861
you are definitely sisters.

33:16.385 --> 33:18.518
HARRY:
Maggie,

33:18.561 --> 33:20.041
trust your voice.
The more you do,

33:20.085 --> 33:22.739
the less you'll be overwhelmed
by the voices of others.

33:22.783 --> 33:24.611
Oh.

33:24.654 --> 33:27.527
Is that, like, the official way
I control my power?

33:27.570 --> 33:29.311
'Cause it's...

33:29.355 --> 33:31.531
it's kind of ruining
my social life.

33:31.574 --> 33:34.012
Yes. And it's also

33:34.055 --> 33:35.622
the Yoga Mill mantra.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.973
What do we do about that?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.931
HARRY: Well,
the Prism can't be destroyed.

33:40.975 --> 33:42.977
That's why your true mother
hid it in the mirror

33:43.021 --> 33:44.196
in the first place,
to protect you

33:44.239 --> 33:46.328
from its ability
to steal your powers.

33:46.372 --> 33:49.549
She's gone.

33:50.898 --> 33:52.204
All over again.

33:52.247 --> 33:54.771
HARRY: Ladies, I'm sorry.
This demon-fighting

33:54.815 --> 33:58.036
business we do,
it can take its toll on one's...

34:01.387 --> 34:04.042
...emotions.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.618
Here.

34:15.662 --> 34:17.620
You should put it back
in your office,

34:17.664 --> 34:19.709
behind that mirror.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.238
You really trust me?

34:26.281 --> 34:28.240
I trust you.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.242
I don't like you.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.113
But I trust you.

34:32.157 --> 34:34.855
I'll do that straightaway.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.030
Wait, th...

34:37.031 --> 34:39.773
...that janitor at the lab.

34:39.816 --> 34:44.256
Obviously,
you didn't kill her, right?

34:44.299 --> 34:45.257
Of course not.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.954
I just wiped her memory.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.348
But whatever demon attacked her

34:49.391 --> 34:52.090
left behind a fatal aftereffect,
unfortunately.

34:52.133 --> 34:57.007
Harry, I-I didn't tell you
what I knew about that demon.

34:57.051 --> 34:59.097
It left this behind.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.664
I scraped a sample
back at the lab.Oh, no.

35:01.708 --> 35:02.578
What?

35:02.622 --> 35:05.755
Just let me, um...

35:05.799 --> 35:07.235
I'll get back to you.

35:07.279 --> 35:08.584
Oh, and check
your phones, ladies.

35:08.628 --> 35:10.020
We have a shared
calendar now.

35:10.064 --> 35:10.717
Training starts

35:10.760 --> 35:11.718
tomorrow at 2:00.

35:11.761 --> 35:12.936
Please be prompt.

35:15.939 --> 35:18.246
So, I guess we can trust

35:18.290 --> 35:19.465
Meghan Markle.

35:19.508 --> 35:23.295
And we all have
to listen to each other.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.513
We're all we've got now.

35:24.557 --> 35:26.950
Yeah. About this
majority rules thing...

35:26.994 --> 35:28.735
Yeah, let's not do it.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.258
I mean, this is
about the Power of Three.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.783
Listen to me,
being all assertive.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.872
She's right.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.787
We all have to agree.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.398
Sold.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.139
Good call, Maggie.

35:41.182 --> 35:45.186
Great. So now that everyone
is listening to me,

35:45.230 --> 35:48.624
I have to give you guys
some personal advice.

35:48.668 --> 35:51.453
You need to stop living
in the past.

35:52.454 --> 35:53.934
I know it's hard, but...

35:53.977 --> 35:55.979
just forget you ever heard
about Niko and Greta.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.982
That wasn't meant
for your ears.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.855
And you...

36:02.986 --> 36:04.597
...you need to
apologize to Galvin.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.600
Hey, if you don't want me
to read your minds,

36:07.643 --> 36:09.210
don't let me touch you.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.212
I've got something
I got to do, too.

36:14.259 --> 36:15.869
Hey, how's it going?

36:15.912 --> 36:17.131
We need to talk.

36:17.175 --> 36:18.524
Okay.

36:18.567 --> 36:21.309
You have always
been so good to me.

36:21.353 --> 36:22.397
But...

36:22.441 --> 36:24.007
Maggie...

36:24.965 --> 36:27.837
I have to trust
my own feelings.

36:27.881 --> 36:30.797
Which are telling me
that this is over.

36:32.190 --> 36:36.324

Hey.

36:47.596 --> 36:49.816
You hung up on me yesterday.

36:49.859 --> 36:52.122
Galvin, I was
overreacting.

36:52.166 --> 36:54.124
You were right.

36:54.168 --> 36:56.344
I've just been feeling like
an outsider with my sisters,

36:56.388 --> 36:58.912
and I didn't want to feel
like that here, too.

36:58.955 --> 37:01.131
I'm sorry.
I'm...

37:01.175 --> 37:03.090
really screwing things up.

37:03.133 --> 37:04.961
You're not an outsider.

37:05.005 --> 37:06.789
Not with me.

37:07.834 --> 37:10.663
You sure?

37:10.706 --> 37:12.447
We're cool?

37:12.491 --> 37:15.233
Mm...

37:15.276 --> 37:16.886
Yeah.
Yeah, we're cool.

37:17.974 --> 37:19.672
Okay.

37:19.715 --> 37:21.195
Phew.

37:21.239 --> 37:24.242
MEL: Hey, Niko,
so you're feeling better?

37:25.895 --> 37:29.072
No, of course
you didn't say anything stupid.

37:31.118 --> 37:33.163
Love you, too.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.689
See you then.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.213
See?

37:39.257 --> 37:40.954
You should
always listen

37:40.997 --> 37:43.696
to my advice about Niko
from now on.

37:45.001 --> 37:47.961
Oh, my gosh.

37:48.004 --> 37:51.051
Lucy just commented on my post
with three exclamation points.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.966
Oh, my God, congratulations.

I beg your pardon?

38:41.928 --> 38:44.713
Oh. It's your nickname.

38:44.757 --> 38:47.586
We say it so you don't show up

38:47.629 --> 38:51.198
What? I don't show up
every time you say "Harry,"

38:51.241 --> 38:52.895
only when you call out
"Harry" with purpose.

38:52.939 --> 38:56.072
Why would I show up every time
you say "Harry"? That's absurd.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.074
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.773
This is urgent.
That black ooze,

39:00.816 --> 39:03.210
the Elders confirmed
my suspicions.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.212
It's the primordial
form of the Harbinger.

39:05.255 --> 39:06.561
MAGGIE:
The Harbinger?

39:06.605 --> 39:07.910
What does it...

39:07.954 --> 39:09.564
harbinge?

39:09.608 --> 39:11.479
Its full name
is the Harbinger of Hell,

39:11.523 --> 39:15.701
and its arrival heralds
the third phase of the Prophecy.

39:15.744 --> 39:17.311
"With the blossoming of death
comes the rise

39:17.355 --> 39:18.878
of the Source of All Evil.
And then..."

39:18.921 --> 39:20.401
"...we fall."

39:20.445 --> 39:23.709
Right. That whole
apocalypse thing.

39:23.752 --> 39:24.884
Precisely.

39:24.927 --> 39:26.929
And I don't want
to say preventing

39:26.973 --> 39:29.541
"that whole apocalypse thing"
rests solely

39:29.584 --> 39:32.457
on your shoulders,
but it does.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.634
As I speak, the Harbinger is
probably hunting for a vessel,

39:35.677 --> 39:37.070
a human vessel.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.289
And if it finds one...

39:41.074 --> 39:44.077
...everything's going
to change.
