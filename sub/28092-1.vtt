<i>Make 'em lose
their goddamn jobs.</i>

16:50.390 --> 16:52.992
Confront 'em
everywhere they go.

16:52.994 --> 16:54.994
What's gonna stop
pieces of shit like him

16:54.996 --> 16:57.463
from creatin' more damage?

16:57.465 --> 17:00.365
Guys like this
only have three options.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.835
Die young, life in prison...

17:02.837 --> 17:06.503
or, they start talkin'.

17:06.506 --> 17:08.307
- <i>Let's hope he starts talkin'.</i>
- Fuck that.

17:08.309 --> 17:11.444
There ain't no hope
for motherfuckers like him.

17:11.445 --> 17:14.311
They fucked Lonnie up.

17:14.314 --> 17:16.417
I suggest we do the same.

17:20.487 --> 17:22.423
Come here, man.
Let me talk to you for a second.

17:23.824 --> 17:24.825
<i>Come on.</i>

17:38.605 --> 17:40.740
<i>See that wall?</i>

17:40.742 --> 17:44.644
<i>That's 15 years of work.</i>

17:44.646 --> 17:47.379
<i>A lot of these guys out
are here were just like Babs.</i>

17:47.381 --> 17:49.317
<i>But one by one,
they turned.</i>

17:52.053 --> 17:54.853
See I started this because
I was angry, just like you.

17:54.855 --> 17:57.555
Matter of fact, shit,
I'm still angry.

17:57.557 --> 17:58.823
<i>But all the shit
that they do to us</i>

17:58.825 --> 18:01.359
and nobody seems
to give a damn.

18:01.361 --> 18:04.330
It's that anger that becomes a
part of the emotional tool box

18:04.332 --> 18:07.366
that we use to do this work.

18:07.368 --> 18:09.734
<i>I would also argue that we
can't stay angry forever</i>

18:09.736 --> 18:12.538
because that brings more blood
and more anger

18:12.540 --> 18:15.573
and more blood
and just never stops.

18:15.575 --> 18:16.844
<i>Am I right?</i>

18:19.046 --> 18:20.515
My father...

18:22.850 --> 18:26.619
He was a... a drug counselor
all his life.

18:26.621 --> 18:28.888
He used to have this saying...

18:28.890 --> 18:31.826
"I take human garbage and
I turn it into human beings."

18:35.028 --> 18:39.598
Look, if we can turn
one of these fascist assholes...

18:39.600 --> 18:42.702
so they can see the error
of their ways

18:42.704 --> 18:44.637
then I'll leave a crack
in the door.

18:49.509 --> 18:50.778
<i>Goin' home?</i>

18:57.517 --> 18:59.885
One day,
when you deep sleepin'

18:59.887 --> 19:02.855
we gon' find you
and fuck you up.

19:02.857 --> 19:06.091
You're a monster,
you ain't gonna see shit comin'.

19:06.093 --> 19:07.592
We gon' crack
your head open.

19:07.594 --> 19:09.628
Slice open
your motherfuckin' face.

19:09.630 --> 19:12.697
Just like you did to my son,
you piece of shit.

19:12.699 --> 19:14.934
- Hey! Ma'am! Ma'am!
- He's 14! 14!

19:14.936 --> 19:17.636
<i>Why didn't you let him go?
Why didn't you let him...</i>

19:17.638 --> 19:19.972
Ma'am, calm down, ma'am!

19:23.678 --> 19:26.678
- Answer me! Why?
- Calm down!

19:26.680 --> 19:28.714
Arrest him! Not me!

19:28.716 --> 19:30.549
Don't! Get off me!

19:30.551 --> 19:33.953
I'm comin' for you!
I am comin' for you!

19:33.955 --> 19:36.388
In your dreams,
motherfucker!

19:36.390 --> 19:38.090
In your dreams!

19:38.092 --> 19:40.993
You will never forget
about me!

19:40.995 --> 19:43.428
You better not
close your eyes.

19:43.430 --> 19:45.130
<i>Get off me!</i>

19:56.110 --> 19:58.144
She tried to take
your eyes out and...

19:58.146 --> 20:01.513
You didn't even move,
you should've just kept walkin'.

20:01.515 --> 20:03.616
<i>Somethin' wrong?</i>

20:03.618 --> 20:05.184
Just tired I guess.

20:05.186 --> 20:09.821
<i>♪ You'll be with me
everywhere I go ♪</i>

20:09.823 --> 20:12.590
<i>♪ I'll miss you ♪</i>

20:12.592 --> 20:15.593
<i>♪ I'll miss you ♪</i>

20:15.595 --> 20:18.400
<i>♪ More than you'll ever know ♪</i>

20:20.700 --> 20:23.505
<i>♪ More than you'll ever know ♪</i>

20:28.708 --> 20:30.876
<i>♪ Your love is genuine ♪</i>

20:30.878 --> 20:33.646
<i>♪ Your love is kind ♪</i>

20:33.648 --> 20:36.918
<i>♪ I hope there's only
good for you ♪♪</i>

20:47.027 --> 20:49.928
Hey, you in the patches,
come on over here for a second.

20:49.930 --> 20:53.131
Your mom can do better
than that.

20:53.133 --> 20:56.167
Gavin's gonna get molested.
Don't get molested, Gavin!

20:56.169 --> 20:57.471
Watch out.

20:59.474 --> 21:01.743
Oh, can't we just get
out of here? I need to shower.

21:03.578 --> 21:05.211
If your a fuckin' pervert,
I'll smash your face.

21:06.714 --> 21:07.745
Yeah, that's the spirit,

21:07.747 --> 21:10.049
I say death to all pervs.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.016
<i>What's your name, kid?</i>

21:12.018 --> 21:14.052
- Gavin.
- <i>Gavin, come on over here.</i>

21:14.054 --> 21:16.054
- <i>You live around here?</i>
- <i>Jesus.</i>

21:16.056 --> 21:18.491
- You want a beer?
- Oh, fuckin' hell.

21:18.493 --> 21:19.594
<i>Sure.</i>

21:24.732 --> 21:27.800
Gavin, I'm the Hammer,
this is my son, Babs.

21:27.802 --> 21:29.905
<i>You ever hear
of the Vinlanders Social Club?</i>

21:33.073 --> 21:34.974
<i>You watch YouTube,
I got a YouTube channel</i>

21:34.976 --> 21:36.809
called Race and Reason.

21:36.811 --> 21:38.878
Might find it interesting.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.679
<i>Where you from, Gavin?</i>

21:41.681 --> 21:43.048
Pennsylvania.

21:43.050 --> 21:45.951
Social Club's gonna have
a dinner tonight.

21:45.953 --> 21:48.920
Lot of good eats,
why don't you come on over, huh?

21:48.922 --> 21:51.724
<i>Where you thinkin'
of crashin' tonight?</i>

21:51.726 --> 21:53.995
- Just here, with my gang.
- Your gang?

21:56.264 --> 21:58.731
Hey, listen, Gavin,
you wanna join the real deal

21:58.733 --> 22:00.899
<i>and do some real damage?</i>

22:00.901 --> 22:03.068
Not hang out here
and smash bottles

22:03.070 --> 22:05.005
with a bunch
of pussy faggots.

22:09.677 --> 22:10.678
Come on.

22:43.311 --> 22:45.644
- Hey, monkey.
- Hey, Ma.

22:45.646 --> 22:48.250
- How you holdin' up? Yeah?
- I'm good.

22:50.851 --> 22:54.587
I knew they didn't have
shit on you.

22:54.589 --> 22:55.920
I have a clean towel
and some warm lunch for you

22:55.922 --> 22:57.191
waitin' inside.

23:01.294 --> 23:02.764
What's going on?

23:04.931 --> 23:06.735
Ma, meet Gavin.

23:08.134 --> 23:09.635
Find him a room.

23:09.637 --> 23:11.869
She's gonna take
good care of you.

23:11.871 --> 23:13.140
Hi, precious.

23:18.678 --> 23:19.680
Come here.

23:25.352 --> 23:28.119
Why don't I give you
some lunch first, okay?

23:28.121 --> 23:29.888
Yeah? Yeah.

23:29.890 --> 23:32.957
Fatten that baby boy up!

23:34.394 --> 23:36.895
Go inside, hon'.

24:55.275 --> 24:56.442
Come on!

25:09.355 --> 25:12.159
Hey!
Leave my fuckin' dog alone!

25:32.246 --> 25:34.312
- He's my fucking dog!
- He's a fucking Vinlander.

25:34.314 --> 25:36.782
You wanna fucking go again?

25:36.784 --> 25:39.885
Our ancestors
were spilling blood

25:39.887 --> 25:42.120
for the call of the Odin Gods.

25:42.122 --> 25:45.924
And you cocksuckers are acting
like a bunch of Mexican faggots

25:45.926 --> 25:48.494
fighting over a burrito.

25:48.496 --> 25:50.431
Who's the retard behind this?

25:52.867 --> 25:54.803
I asked, who's responsible?

25:56.771 --> 25:59.707
- I am.
- Why'd you do it?

26:03.878 --> 26:05.980
What're you, fuckin' deaf?
Give me a straight answer.

26:07.782 --> 26:08.750
April...

26:10.351 --> 26:13.551
Babs hurt April.
I hurt him back.

26:13.553 --> 26:17.222
Well, that makes a lot more
sense to me then, huh?

26:17.224 --> 26:21.426
Gavin, Slayer has dishonored
himself. Again.

26:21.428 --> 26:25.296
And his Vinlander brothers,
because Slayer

26:25.298 --> 26:29.267
is a worthless,
fathead fuck sack of shit

26:29.269 --> 26:31.536
who I've been trying
to turn into a man

26:31.538 --> 26:33.539
since he was
a stupid teenager.

26:33.541 --> 26:36.875
But obviously, I failed.

26:36.877 --> 26:39.244
And for that reason...

26:39.246 --> 26:42.414
Every time Slayer fucks up,
I am taxing you

26:42.416 --> 26:46.185
you, you and you
a hundred bucks.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.985
Simple as that.

26:47.987 --> 26:50.923
Because in this family,
we don't tolerate stupidity.

26:50.925 --> 26:52.424
Got that?

26:52.426 --> 26:53.891
- Yes, sir.
- I can't hear you!

26:53.893 --> 26:56.093
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

26:56.095 --> 26:57.531
Now, apologize.

27:01.435 --> 27:02.437
I'm sorry.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.476
Like a real Viking.

27:16.283 --> 27:18.386
Accept my offering, oh,
brother.

27:29.396 --> 27:30.365
Hail.

27:32.065 --> 27:33.034
Hail.

27:36.370 --> 27:39.306
Kid's your probate,
show him around, guide him.

27:41.207 --> 27:44.478
<i>For the rest of you,
dismissed, for now.</i>

27:50.551 --> 27:54.022
Good boy, good boy,
good boy.

27:57.323 --> 27:58.293
Hey.

28:00.194 --> 28:02.494
How you guys, uh,
how you guys doin'?

28:02.496 --> 28:05.030
Well, you know,
we're livin'.

28:05.032 --> 28:07.131
<i>Oh, yeah, well,
it was a very cool photo.</i>

28:07.133 --> 28:08.433
<i>Thank you
for sending it to me.</i>

28:08.435 --> 28:10.601
Hey! Hey! Desi!

28:10.603 --> 28:14.074
Desi! You let her be.
I'm on the fucking phone.

28:15.642 --> 28:18.209
- Is this a bad time? Should I...
- Look, I, uh...

28:18.211 --> 28:19.677
I gotta go cook the girls
some dinner

28:19.679 --> 28:21.379
before they start stabbin'
each other and me.

28:21.381 --> 28:23.014
- So...
- <i>You want me to stop by?</i>

28:23.016 --> 28:24.448
<i>I can stop by if you want.</i>

28:24.450 --> 28:27.921
<i>I can bring, uh,
you sound like you need a beer.</i>

28:29.223 --> 28:31.290
We can just, uh...

28:31.292 --> 28:33.224
<i>Look, I...</i>

28:33.226 --> 28:35.293
<i>I know it's gonna sound
like an excuse, but...</i>

28:35.295 --> 28:37.495
I don't really feel like being
nice to anyone right now.

28:37.497 --> 28:39.231
<i>I just fuckin'
hate being nice to anybody.</i>

28:39.233 --> 28:41.667
<i>So, let's just sit outside,</i>

28:41.669 --> 28:44.403
<i>we can fucking bitch
about life...</i>

28:44.405 --> 28:46.304
<i>Just a couple minutes.</i>

28:46.306 --> 28:48.607
What, you're gonna drive all
that way for a couple minutes?

28:48.609 --> 28:50.242
<i>Yeah, I was supposed to
be in the neighborhood anyway.</i>

28:50.244 --> 28:53.211
- <i>Oh yeah?</i>
- I got a body to bury, so...

28:58.718 --> 29:00.519
So I'll see you later?

29:00.521 --> 29:03.155
Alright, then.

29:03.157 --> 29:06.992
- Uh, gotta go. Gotta go. Bye.
- <i>Okay.</i>

29:06.994 --> 29:10.227
- How's Boss, brother?
- What's your name?

29:10.229 --> 29:12.097
Gavin.

29:12.099 --> 29:14.332
Gavin, you're the lowest form
of life in this club.

29:14.334 --> 29:16.167
My dog holds a higher position
than you do.

29:16.169 --> 29:19.071
I'm your senior VP. You don't
fucking call me brother.

29:19.073 --> 29:20.638
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.576
Good,
then get the fuck out of here.

29:24.178 --> 29:25.280
Yes, sir.

29:28.015 --> 29:31.116
- Why'd you get in the truck?
- Sorry?

29:31.118 --> 29:33.053
You heard me, why the fuck
did you get in the truck?

29:35.155 --> 29:37.723
To keep America white.
Keep this country pure.

29:37.725 --> 29:40.993
- Earn my patches and...
- It's alright, cut that shit.

29:40.995 --> 29:44.196
Cut that shit,
what're you doin' here?

29:44.198 --> 29:45.629
- Becomin' a Vinlander.
- So you what?

29:45.631 --> 29:47.131
Shaved your head
and you got the fuckin' shirt

29:47.133 --> 29:49.600
feel like a man now?

29:49.602 --> 29:52.637
Do you?
You feel like a big man?

29:52.639 --> 29:54.505
You gotta stand
like a fuckin' Viking.

29:54.507 --> 29:56.611
Stand like a fuckin' Viking,
be like a man!

29:58.746 --> 30:01.049
- Yes, sir.
- What're you doin' here?

30:04.083 --> 30:07.351
- I was hungry.
- You hungry?

30:07.353 --> 30:10.254
Go back to Pennsylvania,
you fuckin' idiot.

30:10.256 --> 30:12.124
<i>You wanna go for a walk?
Come on, let's go.</i>

30:56.303 --> 30:58.169
Hey, Julie.

30:58.171 --> 31:01.108
- Hey.
- <i>How you doin'?</i>

31:04.277 --> 31:06.711
Good.

31:06.713 --> 31:09.680
- What's goin' on?
- Behind on the rent again.

31:09.682 --> 31:13.452
Uh, yeah, no. I-I know,
I'll, I'll get it to you, I promise.

31:13.454 --> 31:16.655
Look, I got a complaint
from one of the neighbors.

31:16.657 --> 31:19.457
<i>You and your girls
were at a hate rally.</i>

31:19.459 --> 31:21.792
<i>No, no. No, no, no.
It was, it was just a gig, okay?</i>

31:21.794 --> 31:24.329
<i>We're, we're a little short
on cash right now, so...</i>

31:24.331 --> 31:27.267
<i>I thought we had an
agreement about those gigs.</i>

31:30.403 --> 31:32.736
I don't want
any Nazis in my house.

31:32.738 --> 31:34.674
Or in my neighborhood.

31:37.311 --> 31:39.246
You know, people change,
Sheryl.

31:55.696 --> 31:59.231
- Bad timing?
- Perfect timing for a beer.

31:59.233 --> 32:00.501
- Yeah?
- Hm.

32:08.342 --> 32:09.310
Oh.

32:12.345 --> 32:13.448
It's, uh...

32:15.815 --> 32:17.314
It's Boss.

32:18.752 --> 32:21.253
There's the... She could
have it with, you know...

32:21.255 --> 32:23.522
When she misses him.

32:23.524 --> 32:25.459
<i>I found it in a gas station.</i>

32:28.394 --> 32:29.663
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

32:33.499 --> 32:36.303
What you lookin' at?

32:37.670 --> 32:38.639
You.

32:41.440 --> 32:44.176
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

32:44.178 --> 32:45.446
Oh, fuck.

32:48.814 --> 32:51.249
Our five minutes are up.

32:51.251 --> 32:53.187
Got more than five minutes.

32:58.792 --> 33:01.659
Okay. Good job. Okay.

33:01.661 --> 33:05.132
Got it on? Breathe. Okay.

33:05.798 --> 33:07.734
Okay. Slow.

33:14.440 --> 33:15.874
<i>Thanks.</i>

33:24.817 --> 33:26.753
Do you have one
that you regret?

33:27.920 --> 33:29.788
Some.

33:29.790 --> 33:31.822
- What? You got one you regret?
- I...

33:31.824 --> 33:33.891
Hm, maybe.

33:33.893 --> 33:34.926
Let's see it, let's see it,
let's see it.

33:34.928 --> 33:36.962
No.

33:36.964 --> 33:38.796
I wanna fuckin' see it.
Let's see it.

33:38.798 --> 33:41.268
Fuck. Okay.

33:43.303 --> 33:45.803
<i>Danny Lombardo gave it to me.</i>

33:45.805 --> 33:47.671
Can't even look at it
without being sick.

33:47.673 --> 33:49.573
I can fix that for you.

33:49.575 --> 33:51.509
That's fuckin' easy,
that's like...

33:51.511 --> 33:53.714
For me,
fuckin' bread and butter.

33:55.314 --> 33:58.251
So... when was your first one?

33:59.719 --> 34:01.188
This right here.

34:02.456 --> 34:04.522
This, I got it
when I was 14.

34:04.524 --> 34:08.359
And, um... Uh,
Fred gave it to me, actually.

34:08.360 --> 34:09.960
- <i>Fred?</i>
- Yeah, he, uh-uh...

34:09.963 --> 34:11.899
President of the club,
and, um...

34:13.431 --> 34:15.632
So, I was, uh...

34:15.635 --> 34:18.503
I lived with my mom, grow,
growin' up, and, uh,

34:18.505 --> 34:20.804
she had a, a drinking problem,
she passed away,

34:20.806 --> 34:22.940
and, uh,
I moved in with my dad.

34:22.943 --> 34:25.809
Um,
he was a fuckin' drinker too.

34:25.811 --> 34:28.646
Fuckin' horrible fuckin' drunk.
Horrible. The worst.

34:28.648 --> 34:32.283
And, um, I w-went from,
you know,

34:32.284 --> 34:34.318
cleanin' up bottles
to havin' 'em thrown at my head.

34:34.320 --> 34:36.387
Running away constantly, uh,

34:36.389 --> 34:38.324
lived on the streets
for a while.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.893
And, um, Fred took me in.

34:42.896 --> 34:46.429
Picked me up,
put clothes on me,

34:46.431 --> 34:49.434
fed me... got me a job.

34:49.436 --> 34:51.369
Um, I owe him.

34:51.371 --> 34:53.338
- Fuckin' made me, that guy.
- I don't know...

34:53.340 --> 34:55.606
And Shareen too, both.

34:55.608 --> 34:56.576
Okay.

34:57.711 --> 35:00.812
- What?
- I just...

35:00.814 --> 35:03.284
I think real family
don't make you owe shit.

35:05.452 --> 35:08.419
The only responsibility
I have...

35:08.421 --> 35:10.387
are those three girls.

35:10.389 --> 35:12.659
I just want 'em to have
a better life than I did.

35:14.760 --> 35:17.062
Well, you're a good mom.

35:17.064 --> 35:19.631
I don't know about that.

35:19.633 --> 35:20.899
The fuck are you talkin' about?
You...

35:20.901 --> 35:22.837
You're all they have.

35:24.338 --> 35:26.604
- Hm.
- Fuck them.

35:26.606 --> 35:28.606
Fuck those people
who wanna tell you

35:28.608 --> 35:30.742
what to do and how to raise
your own fucking kids.

35:30.744 --> 35:33.077
Fuck them. Fuck 'em!

35:33.079 --> 35:35.113
- Fuck 'em.
- Yeah. Fuck 'em.

35:35.115 --> 35:37.816
Fuck 'em. Yeah.
Fuck them.

35:37.818 --> 35:39.486
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.

35:49.796 --> 35:52.497
- What are these scars?
- Nothin'.

35:52.499 --> 35:54.064
What do you mean?

35:54.066 --> 35:57.635
- They're fuckin' nothing. Hey.
- What are they?

35:57.637 --> 35:58.870
Oh, what?
Are we not being honest now?

35:58.872 --> 36:01.039
No, you keep asking, and...

36:01.041 --> 36:02.707
You'll fuckin' find out
what they are

36:02.709 --> 36:04.376
if you keep asking
stupid fuckin' questions

36:04.378 --> 36:05.646
that's for sure.

36:06.947 --> 36:09.414
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm.

36:09.416 --> 36:11.950
- What are you gonna do to me?
- I gonna fuckin' cut you.

36:11.952 --> 36:15.053
- With my fuckin' razor.
- Hm...

36:15.055 --> 36:17.088
I'm gonna make you bleed.

36:17.090 --> 36:19.090
And then I'm gonna
fuckin' lick it off you.

36:19.092 --> 36:21.959
That's what I'm gonna do. I'm
gonna fuckin' lick it off you.

36:21.961 --> 36:23.995
- Is that a promise?
- Yeah, it is.

36:23.997 --> 36:24.965
Yeah?

37:08.941 --> 37:09.909
Ooh.

37:35.135 --> 37:36.968
Desi, I wouldn't be here

37:36.970 --> 37:38.503
if I didn't see potential
in this, okay?

37:38.505 --> 37:41.004
- Oh, yeah.
- Try it today.

37:41.006 --> 37:42.907
Just, just give me something,
yeah?

37:42.909 --> 37:44.608
- I'm trying.
- You're not trying.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.144
He's actually trying.
Okay, guys!

37:46.146 --> 37:47.845
Come on! Calm down.

37:47.847 --> 37:49.680
She's throwing popcorn at me,
I can't help it!

37:54.787 --> 37:55.889
Just try.

38:00.727 --> 38:03.595
- <i>Hot dog.</i>
- There she goes again.

38:03.597 --> 38:07.200
And on three, two, one...

38:09.503 --> 38:11.439
Fuck you too, mom.

38:13.673 --> 38:16.941
There you go.
That's how you do it.

38:16.943 --> 38:19.711
- I got something for you guys.
- Ooh! Oh.

38:19.713 --> 38:23.280
- This is for Iggy Pop.
- Yay! Thank you.

38:23.282 --> 38:25.517
- Sierra.
- Thank you.

38:25.519 --> 38:28.086
- And Desi.
- Thanks.

38:28.088 --> 38:30.120
Open it, open it, open it,
open it, open it, open it.

38:30.122 --> 38:31.722
Oh, it's so cute!

38:33.793 --> 38:35.959
What you doin', huh?
What you doin'?

38:35.961 --> 38:37.898
I don't think she likes it.

38:44.871 --> 38:46.704
You guys wanna go surfing?

38:46.706 --> 38:48.539
Wow!

38:48.541 --> 38:51.142
I'm gonna show you.

38:51.144 --> 38:53.678
- Drive okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:53.680 --> 38:54.648
Good.

38:55.881 --> 38:58.149
This is it.

38:59.218 --> 39:00.919
- Awesome.
- It's cool.

39:00.921 --> 39:04.055
Wow. This is incredible.

39:04.057 --> 39:05.526
<i>So what?</i>

39:08.061 --> 39:09.760
Are all these yours?

39:09.762 --> 39:11.963
<i>Yeah, the ones top left. Yes.</i>

39:11.965 --> 39:14.966
- <i>You are talented.</i>
- <i>I wouldn't go that far.</i>

39:14.968 --> 39:16.733
- How much do these go for?
- Uh, those ones there...

39:16.735 --> 39:18.903
Three-fifty-four, and...
Starting from there.

39:18.905 --> 39:20.872
- Wait, seriously?
- Uh-huh.

39:20.874 --> 39:22.740
Wow, you must make good money.

39:22.742 --> 39:24.175
<i>Well, it all goes to the club,
but on a good day,</i>

39:24.177 --> 39:26.646
bring in about 1200, 1500,
somethin' like that.

39:28.347 --> 39:30.782
- Hey, can I get this one?
- <i>No.</i>

39:30.784 --> 39:33.084
No, no, we spoke about this.
Not till you're 18.

39:33.086 --> 39:35.022
Yeah, I got somethin'
for you guys, hang on.

39:36.923 --> 39:38.356
<i>You guys like transfers?</i>

39:38.358 --> 39:40.892
They're like fake tattoos,
basically.

39:40.894 --> 39:42.626
Here, Sierra.
You try this before?

39:42.628 --> 39:44.829
- Oh, they're pretty.
- Just put 'em on your arm...

39:44.831 --> 39:48.131
- Don't fuckin' touch me.
- Hey, Des.

39:48.133 --> 39:50.200
- Where you goin'?
- Air.

39:50.202 --> 39:53.704
Don't go far, okay?
We're leaving in an hour.

39:53.706 --> 39:55.340
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's alright, it's alright.

40:18.264 --> 40:20.164
- Can you draw?
- No.

40:20.166 --> 40:22.265
<i>Oh,
I hope you like the rainbow behind it.</i>

40:25.238 --> 40:26.903
<i>I felt so bad when she...</i>

40:26.905 --> 40:28.305
I'm sorry, listen...

40:28.307 --> 40:30.675
- No, I thought it would be cool.
- No, ignore it.

40:30.677 --> 40:32.843
She's not a kid anymore.

40:32.845 --> 40:35.146
She had it rough
when she was a kid.

40:35.148 --> 40:36.617
Did something happen to her?

40:38.751 --> 40:41.119
<i>Wait, was it that fuckin'
douchebag, what's his name?</i>

40:41.121 --> 40:42.887
- Danny Lombardo.
- <i>That's the one.</i>

40:42.889 --> 40:45.055
Yeah, a piece of shit
to give me that?

40:45.057 --> 40:47.658
What'd he do?

40:47.660 --> 40:50.294
I came home early
from work one day,

40:50.296 --> 40:52.162
found him in her room
beating the shit out of her.

40:58.070 --> 41:01.338
Told myself no one will ever
lay another hand on my kids.

41:01.340 --> 41:02.342
No one.

41:06.345 --> 41:11.082
- Hey, doll, is that car yours?
- My mom's.

41:11.084 --> 41:12.950
<i>You're Babs'
friend, aren't ya?</i>

41:12.952 --> 41:16.754
- My mom is.
- And she dragged you down here?

41:16.756 --> 41:19.026
This is the last place you
wanna be stuck in, huh, doll?

41:20.160 --> 41:23.160
- <i>Yeah, kinda.</i>
- Yeah.

41:23.162 --> 41:25.028
<i>Are they inside?</i>

41:25.030 --> 41:28.302
Yeah, he's givin' her
a tattoo or somethin' retarded.

41:29.769 --> 41:32.035
You're Desiree from Sid's?

41:32.037 --> 41:34.805
<i>Yeah, you've got the voice
of an angel, babe.</i>

41:34.807 --> 41:38.108
I'm Shareen.
You can call me Ma.

41:38.110 --> 41:41.079
Nice to meet you.

41:41.081 --> 41:43.017
Hey, do you have a lighter?

41:56.195 --> 41:58.729
Hm. Sorry, rude of me.

41:58.731 --> 42:01.332
- You first.
- Thanks. I'm not allowed.

42:01.334 --> 42:02.834
What do you mean,
you're not allowed?

42:02.836 --> 42:04.836
- Who's not allowing you?
- My mom.

42:04.838 --> 42:07.171
<i>Your mom's not allowing you?</i>

42:07.173 --> 42:10.041
I'll tell you what,
I'm the owner of this place.

42:10.043 --> 42:11.742
And I'm allowing you
to do whatever you want,

42:11.744 --> 42:14.077
so, how about that?

42:14.079 --> 42:16.012
<i>You got very delicate skin.</i>

42:16.014 --> 42:18.451
- Oh, yeah? You like it?
- I love it.

42:22.021 --> 42:23.421
Yeah.

42:35.535 --> 42:38.903
What's the verdict?

42:38.905 --> 42:40.841
- It's pretty strong.
- <i>Mm.</i>

42:56.421 --> 42:58.923
You like her?

42:58.925 --> 43:01.792
- Yeah, she's cool.
- That's Freya.

43:01.794 --> 43:04.394
Goddess of love and death.

43:04.396 --> 43:06.497
You know,
she slayed the souls of sinners

43:06.499 --> 43:09.267
killed in battle,
so they could feast in Valhalla?

43:09.269 --> 43:12.206
That's how cool she is.
Mm-hm.

43:15.508 --> 43:17.874
<i>She's all yours, precious.</i>

43:17.876 --> 43:20.178
- <i>Really?</i>
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>

43:20.180 --> 43:24.148
You got her killer eyes
and her gorgeous hair.

43:24.150 --> 43:25.119
Thanks.

43:32.224 --> 43:34.158
Shit. I gotta go.

43:34.160 --> 43:35.892
Hey.

43:35.894 --> 43:37.831
First one's on us, doll.

43:59.285 --> 44:00.584
- How're they doin' back there?
- I don't know.

44:00.586 --> 44:02.456
- Are they alright?
- Yeah, I think they are.

44:07.360 --> 44:10.164
- Come on, go fast!
- Go faster!

44:11.130 --> 44:12.099
Hey!

44:22.608 --> 44:25.142
Whoo!

44:25.144 --> 44:27.211
- Ready?
- Hands off the wheel!

44:27.213 --> 44:31.615
Not even driving!
Not even driving!

44:57.043 --> 44:58.608
Finally.

45:06.385 --> 45:08.322
Think it came out pretty good.

45:10.389 --> 45:13.957
<i>Oh, my God. This is incredible.</i>

45:13.959 --> 45:16.459
- <i>You know what it is?</i>
- <i>What?</i>

45:16.461 --> 45:19.032
It's a black bat flower.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.635
It's beautiful.

45:24.637 --> 45:27.137
This is a fuckin' great job,
yeah.

45:27.139 --> 45:30.106
Hey. Hey...

45:30.108 --> 45:31.377
You like it?

45:32.678 --> 45:34.615
I like
when you're a part of us.

45:44.122 --> 45:46.090
- I wanna be inside you?
- Yeah?

45:46.092 --> 45:48.258
Yeah. I wanna be inside you.

46:30.535 --> 46:34.738
<i>Come on. Let's go here.</i>

46:37.410 --> 46:39.075
<i>Ah. This is it.</i>

46:39.077 --> 46:40.644
Iggy, what do you think
about my look?

46:40.646 --> 46:42.713
You like it? Maybe should've
put some blood on it.

46:42.715 --> 46:46.017
But you're a skeleton,
skeletons don't have blood.

46:46.019 --> 46:48.184
<i>Yeah. You girls excited, huh?</i>

46:48.186 --> 46:50.254
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

46:50.256 --> 46:51.622
<i>Looks good.</i>

46:51.624 --> 46:54.492
Just your friendly
neighborhood documentarian.

46:54.494 --> 46:56.227
It's the Antifa welcoming party.

46:56.229 --> 46:57.461
- <i>Shut the fuck up, Jenkins.</i>
- <i>Alright.</i>

46:57.463 --> 46:59.399
Y'all have a nice day now.

47:00.599 --> 47:02.166
- Put this on.
- Okay.

47:02.168 --> 47:04.104
Got it? Hold my hand.

47:07.139 --> 47:09.205
Happy Halloween!

47:09.207 --> 47:11.408
- How y'all doin'?
- Hey, don't film the kid.

47:11.410 --> 47:13.778
Hey. Oh, shit,

47:13.780 --> 47:16.379
Goddamn, what the hell?

47:16.381 --> 47:18.182
Oh, shit.
Hey, who's this pretty lady?

47:18.184 --> 47:19.749
- Hey, what's your name, huh?
- Just keep walking.

47:19.751 --> 47:21.419
Listen, how you been?
I want to talk to you, man.

47:21.421 --> 47:22.820
Oh! You know

Stop that shit.

47:24.157 --> 47:25.488
Come on, Babs.

47:25.490 --> 47:26.624
So, you're a family man now?

47:26.626 --> 47:28.291
Listen, talk to me, Babs, yeah.

47:28.293 --> 47:29.559
You need my help? Huh?

47:29.561 --> 47:30.561
You need my help?
Come on, man.

47:30.563 --> 47:32.662
Hey, hey! Come on, man!

47:32.664 --> 47:34.365
Come on, Babs,
you know, the bad kids

47:34.367 --> 47:36.100
ain't gonna like it.

47:36.102 --> 47:37.568
You know what
kinda people they are.

47:39.405 --> 47:41.508
<i>You got a heart,

<i>Just up here, keep goin'.</i>

48:15.273 --> 48:16.539
<i>Yeah, hey, Des.</i>

48:16.541 --> 48:18.374
This is their mom, Julie.

48:18.376 --> 48:20.343
Hey. Heard a lot about you.

48:20.345 --> 48:22.680

48:22.682 --> 48:24.715
Hey, girls, why don't you
join the rest of the kids?

48:24.717 --> 48:26.483
Go grab a torch,
burn the Jihadi.

48:26.485 --> 48:29.820
Uh, no. We're not
into that anymore, sorry.

48:29.822 --> 48:32.655
You're not into Halloween?

48:32.657 --> 48:35.492
- <i>We're into candy.</i>
- <i>Okay, you into hot dogs?</i>

48:35.494 --> 48:38.229

48:38.231 --> 48:39.597
<i>Here, take this
Go pass that around.</i>

Uh, we've been together
for a couple of months.

48:59.418 --> 49:01.551
Enjoy it while it lasts.

49:01.553 --> 49:05.856
'Cause I know my son and he
ain't there for the long run.

49:05.858 --> 49:08.794

50:51.463 --> 50:53.400
<i>We'll be there in a minute.</i>

51:07.979 --> 51:09.481
Look...

51:13.452 --> 51:14.888
I like you.

51:16.555 --> 51:18.321
I like...

51:18.323 --> 51:20.823
I like how you treat my girls,
but...

51:20.825 --> 51:22.762
I'm not doing this again.

51:23.863 --> 51:25.662
We've gone too far,
I'm not...

51:25.664 --> 51:28.631
I'm not putting them
back in this shit.

51:28.633 --> 51:30.903
I'm not doing it.
I won't have 'em around it.

51:32.438 --> 51:33.836
You're better
than those racist shitheads.

51:33.838 --> 51:35.307
This is my family.

51:37.510 --> 51:39.910
And I know that they're, um...

51:39.912 --> 51:41.381
It's not normal.

51:44.015 --> 51:45.952
But this is what I have.

51:50.088 --> 51:53.323
But I want you...

51:53.325 --> 51:54.957
And I would never let
anything happen

51:54.959 --> 51:56.896
to those girls, ever.

52:00.066 --> 52:01.534
Swear to me.

52:10.476 --> 52:11.244
Fuck.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.613
I'm gonna get
round your mouth, right?

52:17.615 --> 52:20.550
- Uh, right there?
- Uh-huh.

52:20.552 --> 52:22.586
- Is it cold?
- Mm-hm.

52:22.588 --> 52:23.954
Uh, so, what was your favorite
candy that you ate?

52:23.956 --> 52:25.057
Um...

52:26.025 --> 52:27.459
Lollipop.

52:31.530 --> 52:33.363
It's not comin' off!

52:33.365 --> 52:35.365
You gotta do it harder.

52:35.367 --> 52:37.033
Get in there.

52:37.035 --> 52:39.405
Is it true, what Desi said?

52:40.639 --> 52:42.840
I don't know.
What did Desi say?

52:42.842 --> 52:44.910
That you're an evil man.

52:50.816 --> 52:52.952
I don't know.

53:15.840 --> 53:17.676
Maybe you're an evil man.

53:18.711 --> 53:20.647
Maybe you're an evil man.

53:45.137 --> 53:46.769
Yeah. Yep.

53:46.771 --> 53:48.571
<i>Did I wake you up, princess?</i>

53:48.573 --> 53:49.972
No, no. What's going on?

53:49.974 --> 53:51.844
<i>Get your ass outta bed.</i>

53:53.711 --> 53:55.648
<i>Get a move. Now.</i>

54:00.653 --> 54:03.954
I'll be right there, okay?

54:03.956 --> 54:05.892
Give me two secs.

54:07.992 --> 54:09.528
<i>See ya.</i>

54:21.907 --> 54:24.173
Hey, baby. What are you doing,
what are you doing up?

54:24.175 --> 54:26.578
- What's going on?
- Go back to sleep.

54:27.213 --> 54:28.644
What's going on?

54:28.646 --> 54:30.012
Fred, he called
a last minute meeting.

54:30.014 --> 54:31.747
So, I'm gonna...

54:31.749 --> 54:34.751
- It's like three a.m.
- I know.

54:34.753 --> 54:35.919
It's not gonna last very long,

54:35.921 --> 54:37.120
so why don't you
go back to bed?

54:37.122 --> 54:38.588
I was trying not to wake you up.

54:38.590 --> 54:39.957
No-no-no, what, where...

54:39.959 --> 54:41.158
No, it's just gonna be
a quick little meeting.

54:41.160 --> 54:42.758
I'll be back before you wake up.

54:42.760 --> 54:44.029
Are they here?

54:45.564 --> 54:46.963
You fucking kidding me?

54:46.965 --> 54:48.097
Give me a break,
just go back to...

54:48.099 --> 54:49.666
- Hey!
- What?

54:49.668 --> 54:51.033
Call them,
tell them you're not going.

54:51.035 --> 54:53.102
- I can't.
- Are you serious right now?

54:53.104 --> 54:54.805
You fucking liar.

54:54.807 --> 54:57.608
Girls! We're going.

54:57.610 --> 55:00.010
- Get up, Iggy. Now.
- <i>Julie, what are you doing?</i>

55:00.012 --> 55:03.012
We're leaving. Get up, get up.

55:03.014 --> 55:05.983
Stop, will you talk to me
for a second, please?

55:05.985 --> 55:07.718
- Iggy, now!
- What's going on?

55:07.720 --> 55:09.519
- Get your stuff.
- What happened? What happened?

55:09.521 --> 55:11.053
- What did he do to you?
- It doesn't matter.

55:11.055 --> 55:13.023
- What did he do to you?
- Just get your stuff. Take this.

55:13.025 --> 55:14.957
<i>Take this.
I'm done talking to you.</i>

55:14.959 --> 55:16.193
I have to, I have to...

55:16.195 --> 55:18.695
I'm an idiot, what am I doing?

55:18.697 --> 55:21.265
What was I thinking?
I should've done it!

55:21.267 --> 55:24.700
- Come here. Come here.
- Here, take this.

55:24.702 --> 55:26.068
Mom, tell me what's going on?

55:26.070 --> 55:27.803
Just take this, take this...

55:27.805 --> 55:29.740
- Mom, what's happening?
- Mom!

55:29.742 --> 55:31.807
Get off of her! Get off of her.

55:31.809 --> 55:33.809
- Iggy, go. Go.
- Why are you doing this?

55:33.811 --> 55:35.646
- Go. Iggy, Iggy, go.
- Julie.

55:35.648 --> 55:36.914
- Iggy. No!
- Julie!

55:36.916 --> 55:38.582
- I wanna stay with Boss!
- Get off of me.

55:38.584 --> 55:40.584
Iggy, I know, baby.

55:40.586 --> 55:43.253
You have to go. Go.
Take her downstairs now.

55:43.255 --> 55:45.923
- Julie... please.
- No. No-no-no. No-no-no.

55:45.925 --> 55:47.658
I came here for you, for this!

55:47.660 --> 55:50.227
It's not gonna change
our fucking lives!

55:57.936 --> 55:59.738
Julie! Fuck.

56:00.271 --> 56:01.905
Julie.

56:01.907 --> 56:05.111
Stop. Stop, stop. Fuck. Stop!

56:06.278 --> 56:08.615
Hey. Hey!

56:09.914 --> 56:11.914
Come back, Julie!

56:11.916 --> 56:13.950
You have to trust somebody
at some point, you know that.

56:13.952 --> 56:16.221
Yeah, it sure as hell
ain't starting with you.

56:38.110 --> 56:41.044
<i>The fuck was that back there?</i>

56:41.046 --> 56:43.213
We got in a fight. It's none
of your fuckin' business.

56:43.215 --> 56:46.115
You ain't got time
for that shit.

56:46.117 --> 56:48.151
Hey, did she tell you
her old man

56:48.153 --> 56:51.622
back in Wisconsin was
with the Klan in the old days?

56:51.624 --> 56:53.026
She tell you that?

56:56.361 --> 56:57.894
She didn't mention
that to me, no.

56:57.896 --> 56:59.296
Yeah, he was a goddamned rat.

56:59.298 --> 57:00.934
Dropped the patch.

57:03.735 --> 57:04.834
What's the kid doin' here?

57:04.836 --> 57:06.370
He's earnin' his reds tonight.

57:06.372 --> 57:09.071
- Aren't you, son?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

57:09.073 --> 57:11.878
<i>Hey, Gavin,
why don't you give Babs a beer?</i>

57:17.249 --> 57:19.084
Loosen the fuck up.

57:42.374 --> 57:44.811
<i>Alright, let's go. Go.</i>

58:23.048 --> 58:26.718
<i>Fuck outta here!
Let's go! Move, let's go!</i>

58:28.720 --> 58:30.486
<i>Come on, come on, move it, man!</i>

58:34.425 --> 58:36.361
Go, go, go, go on.

58:53.378 --> 58:54.347
Shit!

58:58.450 --> 59:00.850
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Gimme that!

01:00:43.521 --> 01:00:45.555
One People's.

01:00:45.557 --> 01:00:47.423
<i>You have a collect call from...</i>

01:00:47.425 --> 01:00:49.024
<i>Bryon Widner.</i>

01:00:49.026 --> 01:00:51.861
<i>To accept this call, press one.</i>

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.240
Hello?

01:01:04.242 --> 01:01:06.075
<i>Hey, how you doin'?
Can you hear me?</i>

01:01:06.077 --> 01:01:08.514
- <i>It's me.</i>
- <i>I'm listening.</i>

01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:13.285
Listen, I, uh, I quit.

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:17.086
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

01:01:17.088 --> 01:01:18.320
<i>You really
think I'd be calling you</i>

01:01:18.322 --> 01:01:20.258
<i>if I was still in this shit?</i>

01:01:23.095 --> 01:01:26.629
That kid from the
rally, is he okay?

01:01:26.631 --> 01:01:29.298
Why do you wanna know?

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.269
<i>Because I feel
fuckin' sick about what I did.</i>

01:01:32.271 --> 01:01:33.539
Yeah, you should.

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:36.608
That's a start.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:42.412
Let's just say he's got some,
uh, good people around him.

01:01:42.414 --> 01:01:44.613
I tried burnin'
my fuckin' face off.

01:01:44.615 --> 01:01:47.182
That didn't work.

01:01:47.184 --> 01:01:49.121
I don't know what to do.

01:01:50.956 --> 01:01:53.892
Look, you know I can help you
but it ain't for free.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.559
I need information.

01:01:57.561 --> 01:01:59.497
<i>About your Viking family.</i>

01:02:11.575 --> 01:02:14.209
Hey, girls, don't forget
to pack the closet, okay?

01:02:14.211 --> 01:02:15.480
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:02:27.693 --> 01:02:30.426
Boss!

01:02:30.428 --> 01:02:32.898
<i>Mom,
can we get this thing out of here?</i>

01:02:48.146 --> 01:02:49.582
You look like shit.

01:02:52.517 --> 01:02:54.520
I just came to say
that I'm sorry.

01:02:57.255 --> 01:03:00.189
- And?
- And we took off.

01:03:00.191 --> 01:03:03.126
We left. It was just him
and these bags.

01:03:03.128 --> 01:03:05.530
That's it. That's all I got.

01:03:08.432 --> 01:03:10.633
Yeah, well,
I don't trust you.

01:03:10.635 --> 01:03:14.738
I get it, but I'm gonna do
whatever it takes...

01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.307
to prove it to you
I'm not gonna fuck it up again.

01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:18.611
I'm not.

01:03:23.148 --> 01:03:24.381
- No.
- Julie. Hey, wait!

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:26.783
Julie! Julie, wait! Julie!

01:03:26.785 --> 01:03:30.285
We burned down a mosque
in Toledo.

01:03:30.287 --> 01:03:33.390
And there was people inside.
And it felt fuckin' sick.

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:35.658
It felt fuckin' wrong.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.193
I just want it all
to be fuckin' over.

01:03:37.195 --> 01:03:40.195
I am never fucking
goin' back there, ever.

01:03:40.197 --> 01:03:41.566
I am out.

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.974
What are Ma and Pa
gonna think about that?

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:53.678
Real family
don't make you owe shit.

01:04:49.367 --> 01:04:50.834
Don't...

01:04:50.836 --> 01:04:52.669
Don't do that!

01:04:52.671 --> 01:04:55.838
Don't do it!

- What the hell?

- I'm calling the cops.
- Don't call the cops.

01:12:38.169 --> 01:12:42.038
- Why not?
- Just let me talk to 'em.

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.142
Let me find out what they want.
Just take the kids to school.

01:12:54.152 --> 01:12:56.785
- I'm not leaving you alone.
- I dunno what's gonna happen.

01:12:56.787 --> 01:12:58.119
I don't know
what they're gonna do.

01:12:58.121 --> 01:12:59.654

- Fuck.

- You fuckin' better be.

01:13:58.116 --> 01:14:00.382

- Nope.

You haven't paid your dues. I

01:14:08.192 --> 01:14:09.859
- What do you call that?
- I was just here.

01:14:09.861 --> 01:14:11.827
I was working my ass off.

01:14:11.829 --> 01:14:13.695
Working your ass off.

01:14:13.697 --> 01:14:17.065
We think it's time for you
to come back home, kiddo.

01:14:17.067 --> 01:14:19.003
You drive down here
to tell me that?

01:14:21.805 --> 01:14:23.338
No.

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:25.708
You see, the cops back home,
they found

01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:30.011
four illegals hiding
in the field behind that mosque.

01:14:30.013 --> 01:14:32.847
Now, it turns out, they were
working construction that day,

01:14:32.849 --> 01:14:34.883
sleeping inside
a storage room

01:14:34.885 --> 01:14:37.185
<i>inside the mosque
when we burned it down.</i>

01:14:37.187 --> 01:14:41.023
<i>But somehow they got away.
Fuckin' miracle, right?</i>

01:14:41.025 --> 01:14:43.191
All the boys, they say
you were the last to leave.

01:14:43.193 --> 01:14:45.093
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

01:14:45.095 --> 01:14:46.995
All I wanna know, Babs,
is...

01:14:46.997 --> 01:14:49.398
What the hell is going on?

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.466
What do you mean?

01:14:50.468 --> 01:14:51.700
Because we got the Feds

01:14:51.702 --> 01:14:52.735
showin' up at the shop

01:14:52.737 --> 01:14:54.470
and six Jihadis runnin'

01:14:54.472 --> 01:14:58.110
around town jeopardizing
an entire movement.

01:15:04.482 --> 01:15:07.349
I didn't see
any fucking illegals.

01:15:07.351 --> 01:15:09.318
- If I saw any fuckin' illegals...
- You're lying.

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:11.220
- <i>I didn't see any illegals.</i>
- You're a fucking liar!

01:15:11.222 --> 01:15:13.388
No, no, no, because I had to
burn the motherfuckers alive.

01:15:13.390 --> 01:15:15.157
- He's lying.
- Are you... Are you crazy?

01:15:15.159 --> 01:15:16.992
- And this fucking wedding.
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:15:16.994 --> 01:15:18.894
This whole shit!
It's a fucking cover!

01:15:18.896 --> 01:15:21.062
She's my wife! A cover?
Are you fucking insane?

01:15:21.064 --> 01:15:22.364
You've been listening

01:15:22.366 --> 01:15:23.833
<i>He can't even fuckin' read.</i>

01:15:23.835 --> 01:15:25.101
You don't like
the fuckin' match

01:15:25.103 --> 01:15:26.435
because your hands
were shaking...

01:15:26.437 --> 01:15:28.837
Alright, no, no, no!
Ey, settle down!

01:15:28.839 --> 01:15:31.275
- Fucking stop!
- Sit down!

01:15:41.451 --> 01:15:43.387
I want a word with my son.

01:15:51.394 --> 01:15:53.330
Get the fuck out.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:04.873
You can't keep runnin' away
from us like that.

01:16:04.875 --> 01:16:06.175
You can't.
You can't do that.

01:16:06.177 --> 01:16:09.078
Pa needs you. I need you.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.546
- I'm not going back.
- No, you have no choice.

01:16:10.548 --> 01:16:12.080
- I'm not going back.
- Otherwise...

01:16:12.082 --> 01:16:13.114
They're gonna think
you're hiding...

01:16:13.116 --> 01:16:14.483
I fucking live here!

01:16:14.485 --> 01:16:16.284
This is my fucking family!

01:16:16.286 --> 01:16:19.821

not gonna be like that anymore.

01:16:30.567 --> 01:16:33.269
- Son?
- Hm.

01:16:33.271 --> 01:16:38.210
I promise you... I will not
let them touch my baby boy.

01:16:40.044 --> 01:16:42.981
Okay? I promise you that.

01:16:45.049 --> 01:16:47.986

01:18:05.095 --> 01:18:06.395

<i>They eyeballed your ass, Babs.</i>

01:18:12.903 --> 01:18:14.435
- They can't testify.
- I've never seen this...

01:18:14.437 --> 01:18:16.271
I've never seen these people
before in my life.

01:18:16.273 --> 01:18:17.672
- Take it, Babs.
- I swear to God.

01:18:17.674 --> 01:18:19.074

- Take this screwdriver.

01:18:19.076 --> 01:18:20.275
And finish 'em off.

01:18:21.545 --> 01:18:24.012
- Come on.
- Are you fuckin' dumb?

01:18:24.014 --> 01:18:28.050
Hm? Take a closer look
'cause they definitely saw you.

01:18:28.052 --> 01:18:30.118
They're fucking kids.
That's a kid.

I think we get the point.</i>

01:19:52.103 --> 01:19:54.470
Alan, Nick, take Babs in.

01:19:54.472 --> 01:19:57.439
<i>Finish off the Hajis
and burn 'em.</i>

01:19:57.441 --> 01:19:59.708
<i>Let's wrap this fucking
party up and go home.</i>

01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:02.744
Nobody fucking move.
Get back in the truck.

01:20:02.746 --> 01:20:04.613
What?

01:20:04.615 --> 01:20:06.550
You made the fucking rules,
boss.

01:20:08.219 --> 01:20:10.752
Babs dropped
the fucking patch.

01:20:10.754 --> 01:20:13.055
Bryon has to go.

01:20:13.057 --> 01:20:14.992
He'll go when I decide.

01:20:21.765 --> 01:20:24.099
I'm not your fuckin' monkey.

01:20:24.101 --> 01:20:26.135
<i>And I'm tired of you
calling me stupid names.</i>

01:20:26.137 --> 01:20:28.404
And backing up
with this fucking traitor!

01:20:28.406 --> 01:20:31.205
Slayer, I hear you.
I know you're angry.

01:20:31.207 --> 01:20:34.309
Let's, let's just go home
and solve this.

01:20:34.311 --> 01:20:35.580
<i>Okay, pumpkin?</i>

01:20:37.747 --> 01:20:39.683
Please, put the gun down.

01:20:41.384 --> 01:20:43.151
<i>I hear you.
I know you're angry.</i>

01:20:43.153 --> 01:20:44.653
You know what?

01:20:44.655 --> 01:20:48.791
It's time for the old fuck
and her majesty to step down

01:20:48.793 --> 01:20:50.793
and let the young folk
take the lead.

01:20:50.795 --> 01:20:52.627
You boys?

01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:55.763
Because we cannot stand
your fucking attitude anymo...

01:21:10.246 --> 01:21:14.052
Congratulations, son, you just
earned yourself a second patch.

01:21:15.719 --> 01:21:18.656
Kid's got more balls than
the rest of you fucking faggots.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.696
<i>Alright, clean it up.</i>

01:22:20.918 --> 01:22:24.685
Oh, God! Bryon? Baby?

01:22:24.687 --> 01:22:26.521
<i>Listen, I can't really talk.</i>

01:22:26.523 --> 01:22:28.190
<i>He's at Toledo Hope.</i>

01:22:28.192 --> 01:22:30.462
<i>Get here fast
before they kill him.</i>

01:22:31.762 --> 01:22:33.865
<i>Get here. Get here now.</i>

01:22:39.702 --> 01:22:43.905
<i>I've only been to a
hospital two times in my life,</i>

01:22:43.907 --> 01:22:49.578
the day I was born and the day
Ma went into labor.

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.515
When finally I got here...

01:22:52.782 --> 01:22:54.718
I just knew it was over.

01:22:56.452 --> 01:22:57.722
No heartbeat.

01:22:59.189 --> 01:23:00.457
No nothin'.

01:23:01.925 --> 01:23:03.393
And Ma...

01:23:05.562 --> 01:23:08.363
She had to go through labor

01:23:08.365 --> 01:23:11.733
and deliver a still baby

01:23:11.735 --> 01:23:14.671
with the cord
wound around his neck.

01:23:20.945 --> 01:23:23.747
Took us a whole year
to get back to ourselves.

01:23:25.381 --> 01:23:28.816
We didn't dare
get attached to

01:23:28.818 --> 01:23:30.921
anything that was ours again.

01:23:34.857 --> 01:23:37.758
<i>Babs, you're more
than a son to us.</i>

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:41.566
Ma and I, we made
a real investment in you.

01:23:42.765 --> 01:23:44.701
But in this business...

01:23:46.437 --> 01:23:47.569
you've gotta stay focused

01:23:47.571 --> 01:23:51.840
or... fall...

01:23:51.842 --> 01:23:53.777
right down the rabbit hole.

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:08.356
You're still breathing
because I own you.

01:24:08.358 --> 01:24:10.628
And every inch of ink on you.

01:24:16.366 --> 01:24:20.968
The only way anyone else
gets access to your trophies

01:24:20.970 --> 01:24:23.907
is if I ask them out myself.

01:24:35.619 --> 01:24:37.519
<i>So who is it?</i>

01:24:37.521 --> 01:24:40.457
Feds? Jenkins?

01:24:41.325 --> 01:24:43.260
SPLC?

01:24:46.597 --> 01:24:48.532
<i>What'd you give 'em, son?</i>

01:24:49.566 --> 01:24:53.368
Hm? Hm?

01:24:53.370 --> 01:24:55.870
What do they know about us?
Huh?

01:24:55.872 --> 01:24:57.808
<i>What do they know?</i>

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.548
Bryon Widner.

01:25:42.085 --> 01:25:43.720
Oh, baby.

01:25:48.025 --> 01:25:49.958
Hey.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.959
Hey.

01:25:51.961 --> 01:25:54.495
- Hey.
- Mm-hm.

01:25:54.497 --> 01:25:57.768
I'm here. I'm here.

01:26:05.142 --> 01:26:07.077
Here. Here.

01:26:08.612 --> 01:26:09.580
Here.

01:26:31.101 --> 01:26:33.571
- Are you sure?
- Mm.

01:27:05.835 --> 01:27:09.003
- Babs?
- Just Bryon, yeah.

01:27:09.005 --> 01:27:10.605
I don't really go
by Babs anymore.

01:27:10.607 --> 01:27:13.574
Oh, good.
Never liked that name no way.

01:27:18.549 --> 01:27:19.517
Look.

01:27:20.983 --> 01:27:22.452
I wanna help.

01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.887
But the Feds need
your full cooperation

01:27:26.889 --> 01:27:28.824
on this thing, Bryon.

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:33.528
Okay?
There ain't no deal without it.

01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:35.096
I just wanna know where we're
gonna go,

01:27:35.098 --> 01:27:36.998
where we're gonna live. Where
the... What about the girls?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.632
Look, man, look, all of that

01:27:38.634 --> 01:27:40.101
is classified, okay?

01:27:40.103 --> 01:27:42.570
Even I won't know
unless you want me to.

01:27:42.572 --> 01:27:45.774
Well, what about school
for the girls?

01:27:45.776 --> 01:27:47.775
- They will be taken care of.
- <i>I see.</i>

01:27:47.777 --> 01:27:49.877
I promise you that.

01:27:49.879 --> 01:27:52.012
It's been a hard time.

01:27:52.014 --> 01:27:54.583
I mean, yeah,
especially for...

01:27:54.585 --> 01:27:56.918
- The little one.
- Yeah.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.119
<i>Well, look, man.</i>

01:27:59.121 --> 01:28:01.590
<i>Look, you have an out,
Bryon.</i>

01:28:01.592 --> 01:28:03.057
<i>I can help you.</i>

01:28:03.059 --> 01:28:05.927
Your birth certificate
and your arrest sheet

01:28:05.929 --> 01:28:09.263
will be the only signs
that you are still alive.

01:28:09.265 --> 01:28:11.266
<i>Alright?</i>

01:28:11.268 --> 01:28:13.834
<i>Other than that,
you'd just be</i>

01:28:13.836 --> 01:28:17.705
<i>some... average nobodies
in this country.</i>

01:28:17.707 --> 01:28:20.644
I'm not exactly fucking average,
I mean, look at me.

01:28:25.147 --> 01:28:27.083
You've got a point there.

01:28:30.821 --> 01:28:31.789
Okay.

01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.991
Here's the thing.

01:28:35.791 --> 01:28:37.859
I wasn't gonna say anything

01:28:37.861 --> 01:28:40.628
because I didn't wanna get
your hopes up.

01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:41.598
<i>Alright?</i>

01:28:44.067 --> 01:28:48.869
There's this wealthy old lady
that works with the SPLC.

01:28:48.871 --> 01:28:53.641
Now... she's been working there
for years.

01:28:53.643 --> 01:28:56.977
They asked her
if she'd put up the money

01:28:56.979 --> 01:29:01.149
to remove the tattoos
from your face.

01:29:01.151 --> 01:29:05.886
<i>She heard about your story.
She was moved.</i>

01:29:05.888 --> 01:29:08.722
<i>We'll have another meeting.
They're gonna talk to her.</i>

01:29:08.724 --> 01:29:10.758
<i>She said she may be interested.</i>

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:14.865
Now, again...
It's, it's a chance.

01:29:18.201 --> 01:29:19.670
Who is she?

01:29:21.071 --> 01:29:22.540
Keeps it anonymous.

01:29:25.842 --> 01:29:30.712
I understand the place
you're in right now. I do.

01:29:30.714 --> 01:29:34.282
<i>See this? Defiant Nation '92.</i>

01:29:34.284 --> 01:29:36.351
- <i>No shit.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:29:36.353 --> 01:29:38.185
<i>And if I told my old lady
I wanted out,</i>

01:29:38.187 --> 01:29:40.020
she would have told
everyone else

01:29:40.022 --> 01:29:42.856
and they would have
murdered me and my kids.

01:29:42.858 --> 01:29:44.626
So what did I do?

01:29:44.628 --> 01:29:46.727
I kidnapped my own sons

01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:48.363
and I filed for legal custody

01:29:48.365 --> 01:29:50.164
and I started talking.

01:29:50.166 --> 01:29:52.803
<i>Now, I didn't even have
what you got here.</i>

01:29:56.607 --> 01:29:57.575
When?

01:30:04.348 --> 01:30:07.248
Be at this hotel
tomorrow night.

01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:09.985
It's an eight-hour drive.

01:30:09.987 --> 01:30:12.052
<i>Under the name "Manning."</i>

01:30:12.054 --> 01:30:16.159
<i>It's safe.
Talk to no one, okay?</i>

01:30:17.661 --> 01:30:19.030
I gotta go.

01:30:20.897 --> 01:30:22.062
What if I take all this
stuff off

01:30:22.064 --> 01:30:23.834
and I'm still a piece of shit?

01:30:25.768 --> 01:30:27.838
<i>There's only
one way to find out.</i>

01:30:47.957 --> 01:30:49.923
<i>Is there anything
else for the girls?</i>

01:30:49.925 --> 01:30:51.793
There's a box for the girls
here.

01:30:51.795 --> 01:30:54.395
What about Boss's box?
Do you have that?

01:30:54.397 --> 01:30:57.699
Uh, what do... H-he needs to go
out. Did he go out yet?

01:30:57.701 --> 01:30:59.400
- I thought you took him out.
- I didn't take him out.

01:30:59.402 --> 01:31:01.705
Okay, he's with the girls.
I'll grab him.

01:31:04.707 --> 01:31:07.374
<i>Come on, Boss, let's pee
in the night. Come on.</i>

01:31:07.376 --> 01:31:09.213
Good boy. Let's go. Good boy.

01:31:10.781 --> 01:31:12.946
Come on.

01:31:12.948 --> 01:31:14.884
Go get it, go get it.

01:31:16.952 --> 01:31:19.788
- Okay, this box is done.
- Babe...

01:31:22.125 --> 01:31:24.426
<i>Girls! Girls!</i>

01:31:24.428 --> 01:31:27.227
<i>Get to the bathroom now.
Just like the drills.</i>

01:31:32.302 --> 01:31:33.771
Oh, my God.

01:31:36.973 --> 01:31:38.707
Julie...

01:31:40.977 --> 01:31:42.043
<i>You okay?</i>

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:45.446
<i>Stay down! Stay down!</i>

01:32:00.062 --> 01:32:02.699
- <i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>
- <i>Come on, now.</i>

01:32:04.835 --> 01:32:06.501
<i>Hold it, stay there!
Stay there...</i>

01:32:06.503 --> 01:32:08.837
<i>Baby, where are you?
Oh, God.</i>

01:32:08.839 --> 01:32:11.071
<i>Bryon...
Bryon, where is she?</i>

01:32:11.073 --> 01:32:13.710
- <i>Baby!</i>
- Get back, get back.

01:32:15.512 --> 01:32:17.412
<i>You're okay, you're okay.</i>

01:32:17.414 --> 01:32:19.114
<i>Remember that time I took you
to that restaurant?</i>

01:32:19.116 --> 01:32:20.215
And this started happening,
I took you outside

01:32:20.217 --> 01:32:21.983
and we-we were on the bench.

01:32:21.985 --> 01:32:23.251
And it worked, right?

01:32:23.253 --> 01:32:24.519
Okay, okay,
let's do that again.

01:32:24.521 --> 01:32:26.186
Here, let's do that again.

01:32:26.188 --> 01:32:29.190
You got it? Okay.

01:32:29.192 --> 01:32:32.226
Oh, you got...
You okay?

01:32:32.228 --> 01:32:34.831
You feeling better?
Yeah?

01:32:40.937 --> 01:32:42.073
<i>Okay.</i>

01:32:46.442 --> 01:32:48.243
- <i>You guys okay?</i>
- Yeah.

01:32:48.245 --> 01:32:50.944
- <i>Yeah? You sure?</i>
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:32:50.946 --> 01:32:54.084
<i>Okay. Okay. Sierra?</i>

01:32:57.387 --> 01:33:00.157
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:34:15.999 --> 01:34:18.166
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:34:18.168 --> 01:34:20.400
Motherfuckers.

01:34:20.402 --> 01:34:21.571
Fuck!

01:34:29.411 --> 01:34:30.944
No, go-go back inside. Go...

01:34:30.946 --> 01:34:32.145
Don't let the kids come out.
Go ba...

01:34:32.147 --> 01:34:34.481
- Go back inside!
- Desiree!

01:34:34.483 --> 01:34:36.484
Desiree, get the girls inside!

01:34:36.486 --> 01:34:38.255
Get them inside!

01:34:56.171 --> 01:34:58.442
Oh, shi... Shit! Fuck!

01:35:07.517 --> 01:35:09.249
Oh, I'll fuckin' kill...

01:35:09.251 --> 01:35:11.953
Oh, I'll fuckin' kill...

01:35:11.955 --> 01:35:13.520
Fuck you!

01:35:13.522 --> 01:35:15.558
<i>You fucking cowards!</i>

01:35:24.968 --> 01:35:27.034
<i>I got you, baby.</i>

01:35:29.238 --> 01:35:31.342
Yeah, I got you.

01:35:36.979 --> 01:35:38.314
I got you.

01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:43.554
We're gonna be okay.
Okay, baby?

01:35:45.287 --> 01:35:47.223
I don't know what
we're gonna do.

01:36:11.246 --> 01:36:12.548
It's okay.

01:36:47.517 --> 01:36:49.420
Wait, there.

01:36:51.021 --> 01:36:52.089
Wait.

01:36:53.622 --> 01:36:55.058
You okay?

01:37:32.327 --> 01:37:33.660
Okay.

01:37:40.236 --> 01:37:43.206
Hey. Hey, baby.

01:37:44.506 --> 01:37:47.510
You okay? Come here.

01:37:49.612 --> 01:37:51.115
Oh...

01:37:52.682 --> 01:37:54.184
Okay.

01:37:56.452 --> 01:37:57.521
Okay?

01:38:12.102 --> 01:38:13.767
Don't answer it! Don't a...
Do-don't pick it up.

01:38:13.769 --> 01:38:15.802
<i>Don't pick it up. Leave it.
Leave it. Leave it.</i>

01:38:15.804 --> 01:38:17.370
- Babe, I know...
- <i>Let it ring, let it ring.</i>

01:38:17.372 --> 01:38:19.373
- <i>Don't pick it up.</i>
- I know.

01:38:21.277 --> 01:38:23.514
Just let it go.
Let it, let it ring.

01:38:49.138 --> 01:38:50.373
Hey, what are you doin'?

01:38:51.273 --> 01:38:54.141
The pool.

01:38:54.143 --> 01:38:57.177
Half an hour only, okay?
Stay where we can see you.

01:39:26.643 --> 01:39:28.312
Be right back.

01:39:53.469 --> 01:39:56.537
- Desi. Desi, get out.
- What for?

01:39:56.539 --> 01:39:57.805
Just get out,
I need to talk to you.

01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:09.520
Where'd you get that tattoo?

01:40:10.887 --> 01:40:13.721
- Black Eye Social.
- You're lying.

01:40:13.723 --> 01:40:15.388
- I know what that means...
- What are you talking about?

01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:17.557
- This is Freya.
- So who you talking to?

01:40:17.559 --> 01:40:19.360
I'd never get one
of your stupid designs.

01:40:19.362 --> 01:40:20.794
No, no, no, no, no...

01:40:20.796 --> 01:40:22.562
It's a Norse Goddess, you idiot.

01:40:22.564 --> 01:40:24.765
Are you talking to them? Is that
how they know... How th...

01:40:24.767 --> 01:40:26.266
- Is that how they...
- I didn't do anything wrong.

01:40:26.268 --> 01:40:27.568
Is that why they keep
showing up...

01:40:27.570 --> 01:40:29.337
I'm not lying,
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:40:29.339 --> 01:40:31.004
- Who did that to you?
- I didn't do anything wrong.

01:40:31.006 --> 01:40:32.907
- Hmm?
- Black Eye Social.

01:40:32.909 --> 01:40:34.542
I didn't do anything wrong.

01:40:34.544 --> 01:40:35.775
<i>It's a Norse Goddess.</i>

01:40:35.777 --> 01:40:37.845
Hey! Bryon!

01:40:37.847 --> 01:40:38.945
If you can tell me
where we're going...

01:40:38.947 --> 01:40:40.248
Help!

01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:41.548
- Is that why they keep...
- Help!

01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:44.385
- <i>Get off me!</i>
- Stay there, baby.

01:40:44.387 --> 01:40:47.788
- Ah! He's hurting me.
- Hey, buddy, you're hurting her.

01:40:47.790 --> 01:40:49.457
I'll fucking kill you, huh?

01:40:49.459 --> 01:40:51.258
You're gonna fucking get
in the middle of this, huh?

01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:53.463
You wanna fucking get
in the middle of shit, do you?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.533
Fucking stay right there!

01:40:59.535 --> 01:41:01.468
Fuck!

01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:02.669
<i>Fucking telling
you this is what</i>

01:41:02.671 --> 01:41:03.870
<i>they fucking do, okay?
No...</i>

01:41:03.872 --> 01:41:05.573
Get away from her!

01:41:05.575 --> 01:41:07.374
- Stop!
- <i>She's a teenager!</i>

01:41:07.376 --> 01:41:08.909
Why do you think
they keep showing up?

01:41:08.911 --> 01:41:11.712
I don't care.
I don't fucking care.

01:41:11.714 --> 01:41:14.547
Get away. Get away from us.

01:41:14.549 --> 01:41:17.051
You're fucking insane.
You're crazy.

01:41:17.053 --> 01:41:18.985
She's terrified of the...

01:41:18.987 --> 01:41:20.954
<i>I got her that fucking tat.</i>

01:41:20.956 --> 01:41:22.657
Wait, I'm sorry.

01:41:22.659 --> 01:41:23.724
- I'm sorry, I didn't...
- Get away!

01:41:23.726 --> 01:41:25.392
I told you...

01:41:25.394 --> 01:41:26.961
You fucking
lay a hand on my kid...

01:41:26.963 --> 01:41:30.297
You lay a hand on my child,
I'll fucking kill you.

01:41:30.299 --> 01:41:32.632
I told you.
It's fuckin' over.

01:41:32.634 --> 01:41:34.467
Get away from us.
Get away from...

01:41:34.469 --> 01:41:35.802
- Sorry that I put a hand...
- I will fucking kill you.

01:41:35.804 --> 01:41:37.370
I didn't mean to,
I was tryin' to...

01:41:37.372 --> 01:41:38.739
I was tryin' to get her
to understand.

01:41:38.741 --> 01:41:40.574
We could've all fuckin' died,
Julie.

01:41:40.576 --> 01:41:42.342
- We almost fucking did die.
- It's over.

01:41:42.344 --> 01:41:45.615
- We almost died...
- Get the fuck out of our lives!

01:42:38.835 --> 01:42:40.735
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:42:40.737 --> 01:42:42.470
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:42:42.472 --> 01:42:43.907
Fuck you!

01:42:48.811 --> 01:42:51.378
Fuck! Fuckin' stop!

01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:52.812
Fuckin' stop it!

01:42:52.814 --> 01:42:54.715

01:42:54.717 --> 01:42:56.452

01:46:03.039 --> 01:46:05.338
- You alright?
- I, uh...

01:46:05.340 --> 01:46:09.111
I don't know if I can do this.

01:46:16.686 --> 01:46:18.822
Show everyone
what I've been seein'.

01:46:22.592 --> 01:46:24.527
I'm gonna wait for you outside.

01:46:53.089 --> 01:46:54.758
Thank you, man.

01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:42.055
<i>This is not their town.</i>

01:49:42.057 --> 01:49:43.891
<i>This is not their town!</i>

01:49:43.893 --> 01:49:45.425
<i>This is not their park.</i>

01:49:45.427 --> 01:49:47.060
<i>This is not their park!</i>

01:49:47.062 --> 01:49:48.796
<i>This is not their state.</i>

01:49:48.798 --> 01:49:50.230
<i>This is not their state!</i>

01:49:50.232 --> 01:49:52.065
This is not their society.

01:49:52.067 --> 01:49:54.234
This is not their society!

01:49:54.236 --> 01:49:56.302
This is not their decision.

01:49:56.304 --> 01:49:58.941
This is not their decision!

01:50:05.313 --> 01:50:07.446
<i>And from the
bottom of my heart,</i>

01:50:07.448 --> 01:50:09.248
I just, I really
