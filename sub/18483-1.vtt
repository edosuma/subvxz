00:53.136 --> 00:54.471
<i>This is where we live.</i>

00:57.349 --> 00:59.184
<i>We have a great backyard.</i>

01:02.896 --> 01:04.772
<i>This is me, sparrow McGee.</i>

01:13.615 --> 01:16.701
<i>I'm on the way to the best party ever.</i>

01:19.496 --> 01:23.124
<i>We only do it once a year
'cause it takes a year to recover...</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:24.668
<i>Sometimes longer.</i>

01:26.878 --> 01:29.339
<i>And this car I'm on the back of
is the world's best car.</i>

01:31.549 --> 01:32.842
<i>The Aussie Ute.</i>

01:32.926 --> 01:34.469
<i>We love our Utes and they love us.</i>

01:40.642 --> 01:44.020
<i>Donuts, fishtails, spin-outs, figure-8s.</i>

01:44.062 --> 01:46.564
<i>We call this sport circle work.</i>

01:46.648 --> 01:49.359
<i>Do not try this at home.</i>

01:50.860 --> 01:54.447
<i>You can win prizes, but who cares?
It's all about the Utes.</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:02.997
<i>This is my best mate, Billy.</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:08.919
<i>Billy says we have the perfect life,
and I reckon he's right.</i>

02:13.133 --> 02:16.720
<i>And to top it off,
we've got another best mate,</i>

02:16.761 --> 02:17.846
<i>Lucy.</i>

02:17.887 --> 02:21.474
<i>Lucy could drive through a puddle of mud
and not spill a drop.</i>

02:21.558 --> 02:24.561
<i>When we were kids,
Lucy saved Billy from drowning.</i>

02:24.644 --> 02:26.084
<i>And they've been arguing ever since.</i>

02:26.938 --> 02:29.566
<i>The three of us are a team.</i>

02:29.607 --> 02:31.568
Lucy!

02:47.500 --> 02:50.128
<i>But a little bunch of mates
needs a bigger bunch of mates.</i>

02:50.211 --> 02:51.571
<i>And we grew up with some beauties.</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:57.260
<i>These girls,
they used to pick on me in high school.</i>

02:58.094 --> 03:00.096
<i>But they grew up just fine.</i>

03:06.394 --> 03:07.830
<i>Now they just pick on their boyfriends.</i>

03:07.854 --> 03:10.565
<i>Part-time cowboys, full-time unemployed.</i>

03:18.615 --> 03:21.242
<i>Podge and his old mate Boof,
they love their beer.</i>

03:21.284 --> 03:23.286
<i>And Michelle, she loves Podge.</i>

03:23.328 --> 03:25.538
<i>And who wouldn't? He's a champion!</i>

03:34.130 --> 03:37.467
<i>And this is Mary.</i>

03:37.509 --> 03:38.968
<i>She's the love of my life.</i>

03:39.010 --> 03:40.053
Hey, Mary!

03:42.555 --> 03:43.915
<i>Please don't tell her I said that.</i>

03:49.521 --> 03:51.231
<i>And this is everyone's best friend.</i>

03:54.317 --> 03:56.194
<i>We call her knob.</i>

03:56.277 --> 03:57.570
<i>Knob belongs to Billy.</i>

04:00.156 --> 04:01.491
<i>She also belongs to me.</i>

04:03.201 --> 04:04.994
<i>Billy really keeps Lucy on her toes.</i>

04:05.036 --> 04:06.162
Billy!

04:10.208 --> 04:11.584
<i>Then he tries to run over them.</i>

04:23.221 --> 04:24.389
Billy!

04:35.275 --> 04:36.693
<i>Now, Lucy's a bit uptight.</i>

04:37.235 --> 04:39.112
<i>And Billy's a bit too loose.</i>

04:52.667 --> 04:54.711
<i>Sometimes I worry
that if those two got together,</i>

04:54.794 --> 04:56.087
<i>it'd be the end of the team.</i>

04:58.465 --> 05:00.300
<i>But luckily, just friends.</i>

05:41.633 --> 05:44.636
<i>People come from all over the country.</i>

05:44.719 --> 05:46.805
<i>- Everybody's welcome.
- G'day, guys.</i>

05:50.850 --> 05:52.644
<i>Even these rough nuts...</i>

05:52.727 --> 05:54.771
<i>Spike and turps.</i>

05:58.608 --> 05:59.609
<i>Enough said.</i>

06:02.779 --> 06:04.114
Look out.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.699
There he is.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.326
Muttonhead.

06:08.993 --> 06:12.080
What's the rush, Popeye?
Afraid you'll miss out on a pretty boy?

06:12.122 --> 06:13.373
Not the way you pick 'em.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.792
Trust me, I'll set you up
with a real cowboy this time.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.503
Told you last year, Princess,
I don't want a cowboy.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.963
I'll get you one with teeth.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.256
Good girl.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.593
I'm just saying, Luce,

06:25.635 --> 06:28.072
if you don't get a root tonight,
it's a year till the next one.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.514
I can wait.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.487
<i>The delicate dance of circle work.</i>

06:44.529 --> 06:48.450
<i>The splendor of a gas-guzzling pirouette.</i>

06:50.869 --> 06:53.705
<i>Let's give it up for Mary Dankovitz,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

06:55.206 --> 06:57.709
Go on, Mary! Kick that sucker.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.336
Totes, Mary!

07:07.427 --> 07:09.929
<i>This isn't drivin' 'round in circles,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

07:10.013 --> 07:14.309
<i>This is driving 'round in circles
really, really fast.</i>

07:22.233 --> 07:23.485
Seen it.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.697
<i>Look at those scores.</i>

07:28.531 --> 07:29.866
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

07:40.418 --> 07:41.461
Missed a spot.

07:49.469 --> 07:53.014
<i>Tonight, we celebrate 100 years</i>

07:53.098 --> 07:56.476
<i>of the ram ticklers
bachelors and spinsters ball.</i>

07:56.559 --> 07:57.811
<i>That's right...</i>

07:57.894 --> 08:00.146
<i>A whole century of this debauchery.</i>

08:00.230 --> 08:03.066
<i>Dress is strictly black tie.</i>

08:03.149 --> 08:08.988
<i>And as always, young folk from all around
flock to dance, drink and fall in love.</i>

08:09.489 --> 08:12.492
<i>For many, that love may last a lifetime.</i>

08:13.451 --> 08:14.911
<i>And for some, just two minutes.</i>

08:15.453 --> 08:18.915
<i>But tonight, we party, party, party!</i>

08:18.998 --> 08:20.625
<i>Australian-style.</i>

08:26.506 --> 08:29.360
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen,
put your paws together for spike and turps</i>

08:29.384 --> 08:30.802
<i>from Manangatang!</i>

08:30.885 --> 08:31.928
<i>Give it up!</i>

08:32.011 --> 08:34.847
Yeah! Yeah, mate! Yeah, mate!

08:52.115 --> 08:54.451
I'm gonna get me arse out.
I'm gonna get me arse out, mate.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.535
Do it, do it.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.258
<i>Spike and turps from Manangatang,
sporting their usual...</i>

09:14.804 --> 09:16.306
Very classy.

09:18.350 --> 09:22.437
<i>And what an apt score, ladies and
gentlemen. What an apt score.</i>

09:27.859 --> 09:30.862
Merline was at me again last night
about getting a full-time job.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.948
Hey, hey! Remain calm, brothers.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.660
The ladies, when they hear our news,
will be rejoicing.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.504
So, it's crosses,

09:47.545 --> 09:51.007
figure-8s, Olympic circles,

09:51.049 --> 09:53.843
flares, fishtails,
and we finish with drifting. Right?

09:53.885 --> 09:55.696
- Sure.
- And the Olympic circles are clockwise.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.846
Whatever.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.641
Not "whatever". Clockwise.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.102
Don't go making it up, Princess.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.979
The deal is I watch you and you watch me.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.856
Yeah, yeah, I'll watch ya.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.234
I'm serious. Watch me.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.696
We could do the lazy Susan.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.030
Yes!

10:14.197 --> 10:15.323
The lazy Susan.

10:15.407 --> 10:17.367
No, we never once got that right.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.536
You push it too hard, you'll kill us both.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.204
Listen. What I want...

10:21.287 --> 10:24.374
What I've always wanted,
is for you to get your act together.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.834
Can't we just freewheel it?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.043
No.

10:40.724 --> 10:45.437
<i>And now, for the final circle
work routine of the day,</i>

10:45.520 --> 10:51.735
<i>wild boy Billy brandish
and my little sister, Lucy McClintock.</i>

10:51.776 --> 10:52.986
Buckle up, sparrow.

10:53.737 --> 10:54.863
<i>And, of course...</i>

10:54.904 --> 10:55.905
Here we go.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.491
<i>Sparrow McGee on the back there,
holdin' on.</i>

11:08.960 --> 11:10.253
Come on, Popeye.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.651
Numbnut!

11:58.927 --> 12:00.720
Billy?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.186
Billy, what...

12:21.074 --> 12:25.328
<i>Billy brandish is out of the car,
and he's out of his bloody mind!</i>

12:25.412 --> 12:29.207
What are you doing?
Get back in the car, Billy!

12:32.252 --> 12:33.837
Billy, you've gone too far.

12:37.716 --> 12:40.635
Billy... what the hell are you doing?

12:40.677 --> 12:42.262
Relax. I've got it all under control.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.763
Get back in the bloody car, idiot.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.098
Just mixin' it up a little bit.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.226
Billy!

12:50.812 --> 12:51.938
Get him...

13:03.533 --> 13:05.201
Relax. I've got it all under control.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.745
Doesn't look like it!

13:08.913 --> 13:10.331
Watch out!

13:13.168 --> 13:14.252
Billy!

13:18.048 --> 13:19.049
Move, Lucy!

13:21.426 --> 13:22.886
Not now.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.242
Good job, Billy.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.458
That was a bit hairy.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.127
Yeah, I've got skidmarks.

13:56.961 --> 14:00.340
<i>Give it up for wild boy Billy brandish!</i>

14:01.925 --> 14:04.636
<i>Give it up for my little sister,
Lucy McClintock!</i>

14:05.595 --> 14:08.556
<i>Give it up for sparrow!</i>

14:08.598 --> 14:10.767
<i>And knob the dog!</i>

14:11.559 --> 14:14.437
<i>This is the true spirit of the country.</i>

14:14.521 --> 14:17.232
<i>Right here... the worm!</i>

14:18.274 --> 14:20.068
<i>The judges aren't happy.</i>

14:20.151 --> 14:22.696
<i>The red flags have come out,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

14:23.571 --> 14:25.865
Come on, it wasn't my fault.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.828
I've seen people with more maturity
than you on an ultrasound.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.246
I love it when you get like this.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.556
I'm going to tear your nuts off.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.016
I love it when you get like that, too.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.458
I'm serious.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.674
That's it. That is it.

14:42.799 --> 14:43.842
That's what?

14:43.925 --> 14:46.094
I've been thinking about leaving.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.973
And now you've decided for me.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.100
I'm moving to Sydney. Tomorrow.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.353
Sydney?

14:55.437 --> 14:57.873
Uncle Barry said he'd give me a job
at the wool exchange in a heartbeat.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.940
Well...

14:58.982 --> 15:01.985
We've got it sweet here, Luce.
It doesn't get any better than this.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.828
No, you're right. It
doesn't get any better.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.822
And I want more.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.991
Sydney will chew you up.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.993
You can't leave. We're a team.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.454
No. Teammates look out for each other.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.955
Work together.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.665
They don't try to kill each other.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.169
What about sparrow?

15:22.172 --> 15:24.090
Time to grow up, Billy.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.397
This is great.

15:39.481 --> 15:42.525
With a bit of practice,
we'll really make that stuff-up work.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.413
Hello, cowboy.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.228
<i>This year's champion...</i>

16:18.269 --> 16:21.773
<i>Mary Dankovitz, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

16:25.527 --> 16:26.986
Love your work, Mary.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.794
Hey, hey, nice show.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.505
Yeah, wish you'd put as much thought
into getting a real job.

16:45.588 --> 16:48.508
Ladies, good news.

16:48.591 --> 16:51.428
We have heard your demands
for us to apply ourselves.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.763
And guess what,
all your problems are solved.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.557
We're getting off the welfare.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.434
This should be good.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.477
We're gonna take life by the horns...

16:59.561 --> 17:00.937
Throw it on the ground...

17:01.021 --> 17:02.355
And shoot it.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.773
You're starting that Internet business?

17:04.816 --> 17:05.942
About time.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.069
It is so much bigger than that, Shaz.

17:08.611 --> 17:09.779
You're gonna love it.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.241
Us fellas are joining the army.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.290
- Taylah, get your gun.
- Which one?

17:21.332 --> 17:23.460
- Hang on.
- The army?

17:23.542 --> 17:24.669
OMG.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.547
Ofg.

17:28.506 --> 17:29.966
How long for?

17:30.925 --> 17:32.135
Three years.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.489
Babe, you said, "show some initiative."

17:35.513 --> 17:38.475
I meant show some initiative
after you've told me what it is,

17:38.558 --> 17:39.642
and I give you permission.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.896
Now, how am I supposed
to run a pharmacy from an army base?

17:42.979 --> 17:45.148
I dunno. A soldier could get a headache?

17:45.231 --> 17:49.152
So, I've been sitting on that
bloody computer for three years,

17:49.194 --> 17:50.820
trying to get my degree,

17:50.862 --> 17:53.698
so that we can get married, and buy a farm.

17:53.782 --> 17:57.827
And now, you've got some flick-knob idea
to go flouncing off and play soldiers?

17:57.911 --> 17:59.704
- Flouncing?
- Totes, rooter.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.540
How am I supposed to run my classes
if we leave town?

18:03.291 --> 18:06.670
My boxercise, my jazzercise, my yogacise?

18:06.711 --> 18:07.837
All my sizes.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.673
And what about Taylah, JJ?

18:09.756 --> 18:12.884
What about the great dreams
that she had for her future,

18:12.967 --> 18:14.552
for her life?

18:14.636 --> 18:16.930
Yeah, I was gonna...

18:19.057 --> 18:21.059
She had plans, JJ, trust me.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.269
Babe, we did it to make you happy.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.689
It didn't work. We're done.

18:27.649 --> 18:28.817
What's that mean?

18:28.858 --> 18:32.737
It means, go find some chicks
who don't mind being treated like shit.

18:32.821 --> 18:36.032
We're gonna find guys
who don't mind being treated like shit.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.203
- Merline?
- Forget it, rooter.

18:41.538 --> 18:42.747
You should've asked me.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.624
Baby, please, c'mon.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.626
Get outta here, tubby.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.753
- Hey, ladies...
- Go. Just go.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.299
Go!

18:58.388 --> 19:01.474
Well, that, gents, is how you dump a woman.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.854
Eye of the tiger, Podge.

19:05.937 --> 19:08.982
No guts, no glory. Live the dream.

19:09.607 --> 19:10.775
I'll do it, Michelle.

19:10.859 --> 19:14.320
Focus, Podge. You're lookin'
excellence right in the face.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.906
Jeez, you look sexy, 'Chelle.

19:17.365 --> 19:18.366
Thanks, Podge.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.452
Enough of that.

19:20.535 --> 19:22.412
I'm just thinking of our baby.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.748
Little Podge.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.584
Hey, honeybear, we should have a talk.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.919
Michelle, do you mind? Podge has to focus.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.796
Focus?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.465
On getting pissed?

19:34.049 --> 19:35.484
This young man is looking down the barrel

19:35.508 --> 19:38.511
of the national b&s ball
beer-drinking record.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.639
Me and Podge, we really have to talk.

19:41.723 --> 19:42.807
Michelle, please...

19:42.891 --> 19:44.851
If Podge doesn't drink the record tonight,

19:44.934 --> 19:46.436
he's just another loser

19:46.519 --> 19:47.979
- with a drinking problem.
- Loser?

19:48.772 --> 19:49.773
You seen tubby?

19:51.066 --> 19:52.426
Billy, can you talk to these boys?

19:55.028 --> 19:56.780
You going for the record, Podge?

19:56.863 --> 19:58.073
He's seizing the dream.

20:01.493 --> 20:02.720
- Good on ya, Podge.
- Thanks, mate.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.204
What? What...

20:04.287 --> 20:06.331
- No guts, no glory.
- You all right, 'Chelle?

20:06.414 --> 20:07.957
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- She's fine.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.626
You sure, babe?

20:10.585 --> 20:12.170
Be careful, hon.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.633
Come on, fellows. Don't go soft on me now.

20:18.510 --> 20:19.761
Tubby!

20:21.179 --> 20:22.889
Bless my soul.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.642
Billy Brandish,
you inordinate pile of dogshit.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.726
Listen, tubby...

20:27.769 --> 20:29.646
And you've brought your lovely fiance.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.523
Hello, prick-sniffers.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.274
- Little arsehole.
- No, thanks, tubby,

20:33.358 --> 20:34.418
- I've already eaten.
- Shut up.

20:34.442 --> 20:35.527
Tubby,

20:35.610 --> 20:37.529
Lucy is moving to Sydney.

20:37.612 --> 20:38.697
- What?
- Tomorrow.

20:38.780 --> 20:39.989
Big deal.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.926
The boys and I just got dumped
because we joined the army.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.661
She's serious. She's breaking up the team.

20:45.537 --> 20:46.538
You what?

20:46.621 --> 20:47.622
We're joining the army.

20:48.123 --> 20:51.251
Well, the girls repeatedly told us to get
off welfare and get our act together.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.669
You joined the army?

20:52.711 --> 20:53.837
Yeah.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.505
First Podge's brother leaves.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.590
Then rooter's. Now Lucy. And you?

20:57.674 --> 20:59.274
Well, you'd be welcome to join us, bill.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.803
Can't be Peter Pan forever, mate.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.725
You've already got enough recruits.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.104
You lot get your own guns?

21:11.187 --> 21:12.188
Sparrow!

21:16.943 --> 21:18.236
Coming, Billy.

21:19.779 --> 21:23.033
Us girls got to stick together now.
Help each other.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.702
Can't be relying on
any of them nuff-nuffs anymore.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.786
What about men?

21:26.870 --> 21:28.747
We get new men.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.916
Better men. Sophisticated.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.144
Are you sure you're not over-reacting?

21:33.168 --> 21:36.546
Yeah, Shazza,
where am I ever gonna find another JJ?

21:36.629 --> 21:38.131
Are you kidding me?

21:38.214 --> 21:41.968
<i>Any girl who can get her picture
on the cover of babes and bows</i>

21:42.052 --> 21:44.637
is gonna have no problem
pulling in the guys.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.056
You got in?

21:46.139 --> 21:47.265
I got fifty bucks.

21:48.475 --> 21:50.477
Yeah. See?

21:51.686 --> 21:53.271
And check this out...

21:53.355 --> 21:55.190
Sealed section.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.984
I can't do that.

21:58.068 --> 21:59.110
Come on.

21:59.194 --> 22:00.379
You've got the prince of Monaco.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.571
He's just a Facebook friend.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.989
The prince of Monaco?

22:03.073 --> 22:04.240
It's nothing special.

22:04.282 --> 22:05.784
I just say, "what are you doing?"

22:05.867 --> 22:08.244
And he says,
"not much, what are you doing?"

22:08.328 --> 22:12.082
And I say, "not much,
what are you doing..."

22:12.123 --> 22:15.585
The prince of Monaco. Panting like a dog.

22:17.754 --> 22:18.838
New men.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.632
- Yeah.
- Sophisticated.

22:20.715 --> 22:22.133
Sophisticated.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.635
Fuckin' oath.

22:24.928 --> 22:26.179
You've always hated the bush,

22:26.262 --> 22:28.515
but here you are,
taking us to a ball in a shed.

22:28.598 --> 22:31.643
I told you, little brother,
I'm here to find me a man.

22:32.435 --> 22:33.937
Dig the cars, though.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.691
They're mint.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.859
Are you sure you're not adopted?

22:39.943 --> 22:41.486
And the girls, too, hey, sis.

22:42.237 --> 22:44.948
Earthy. Easy.

22:44.989 --> 22:48.410
I've done easy. Too much easy.

22:48.451 --> 22:51.496
I'm done with easy. I want real.

22:53.456 --> 22:54.624
Hello.

23:09.472 --> 23:11.433
Just stay close.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.519
Nic!

23:21.359 --> 23:23.236
We could put gravel in her gas tank.

23:24.863 --> 23:26.614
She's got a lock on it.

23:27.615 --> 23:29.325
Or we could cut her fan belt.

23:29.409 --> 23:30.744
She'll have a spare.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.789
You could break her leg again.

23:34.873 --> 23:37.167
That wasn't me. It was the bull.

23:37.250 --> 23:40.050
Come on. Don't blame bignuts.
You're the one that got him all riled up.

23:44.174 --> 23:45.759
What are we gonna do, Billy?

23:47.344 --> 23:48.887
Whatever it takes.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.975
I love Merline.

23:54.059 --> 23:55.518
What am I gonna do without Merline?

23:55.602 --> 23:56.853
Rooter, no!

23:56.936 --> 23:58.438
We got to stick to the plan.

23:58.521 --> 24:00.148
But what about the girls?

24:00.231 --> 24:01.483
Mate, you heard 'em.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.195
The girls are out there,
hunting for new men.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.447
We gotta do the same.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.657
I don't like men.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.579
- Okay. Pick a frock.
- Yeah.

24:14.662 --> 24:18.124
When we're done with you, even Billy
brandish will notice you're a girl.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.669
You know he's gonna pull out
all the stops to keep you here.

24:20.752 --> 24:21.753
Let him try.

24:21.836 --> 24:22.962
He'll be fucked without you.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.089
He'll be fine.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.715
- 'Course, he'll be fine.
- Fine.

24:25.799 --> 24:28.843
Yeah, fine, in a totally fucked way.

24:30.470 --> 24:33.723
Maybe I should stick
with my old boots, old jeans...

24:35.850 --> 24:39.688
Hello, pretty piece of nonsense.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.110
Totes.

24:45.193 --> 24:46.986
I wanna play with his mouth.

24:57.455 --> 24:58.748
Frock me.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.002
All right now, knob.

25:02.085 --> 25:04.254
Let's get you looking good for the ball.

25:05.714 --> 25:07.173
Beautiful.

25:07.257 --> 25:08.258
Good girl.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.695
Hello, good to see you again.

26:10.779 --> 26:12.989
- Get your tickets ready when you can.
- Pardon me.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.866
This is ball committee, coming through.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.010
We just got to sort something out
up in the front.

26:16.034 --> 26:17.369
Ball committee, coming through.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.305
- Official business. Make way, please.
- G'day, Andy.

26:19.329 --> 26:20.830
Hello. Good to see you again.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.100
Ball committee, coming through.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.125
Here we are.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.336
Easy-peasy.

26:27.671 --> 26:28.922
Don't peak too early.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.844
I've been thinking, Billy.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.054
I'm moving on.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.764
What? Where?

26:37.847 --> 26:39.432
Mary.

26:39.516 --> 26:42.644
She's a mountain of a woman
and I can't climb that mountain.

26:42.727 --> 26:44.020
So, I'm moving on.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.980
Sparrow, you haven't been there yet.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.458
I love her like a barrel of biscuits.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.943
Always have. Ever since kindergarten.

26:50.735 --> 26:52.862
You know, that day she tied my bootlaces...

26:54.739 --> 26:56.950
She's my woman and I'm her man.

26:57.409 --> 26:58.910
Are you ever gonna mention it to her?

26:58.993 --> 27:01.121
Look, she needs someone with a firm hand.

27:01.204 --> 27:03.164
Someone who can stand up to her.

27:04.457 --> 27:05.458
I'm too sensitive.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.043
- So, you're moving on?
- Yeah!

27:07.127 --> 27:08.396
- From where you haven't been?
- Yeah.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.588
- Again?
- Abso-finger-lickin'-lutely.

27:10.672 --> 27:11.881
Sparrow...

27:11.965 --> 27:13.234
Look, I don't care if she begs me.

27:13.258 --> 27:14.718
- Mate...
- You know, she can beg me.

27:14.759 --> 27:16.052
She can grab me in a sugar hold

27:16.094 --> 27:18.072
and say, "take me, big fella,
take me to sparrow town."

27:18.096 --> 27:19.973
- G'day, Mary.
- Mary!

27:20.306 --> 27:21.433
Who's talking?

27:21.516 --> 27:23.685
Yeah. Good one, Mary.

27:26.938 --> 27:28.148
Rubbers.

27:35.572 --> 27:36.740
Rubber.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.452
- Thanks, Mary.
- Shut up.

27:45.540 --> 27:46.708
You look great tonight, Mary.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.793
Well, bugger me, it's a shaved monkey.

27:50.587 --> 27:51.755
Beautiful dress.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.424
- Be nice.
- No, no, I mean it.

28:01.681 --> 28:04.684
No, I'm serious. You... you look pretty.

28:06.311 --> 28:07.997
And you do a great job
with security, you know.

28:08.021 --> 28:10.148
Everybody's always saying,
you know, you know...

28:10.231 --> 28:13.443
About you, "Mary, whoa!"

28:13.526 --> 28:15.570
We all feel very secure, very secure.

28:17.572 --> 28:19.282
- Sparrow...
- Yes?

28:20.325 --> 28:23.161
You've got about three seconds
before I kick your nuts so high,

28:23.244 --> 28:25.663
people are gonna think
you're blowing hairy little bubbles.

28:27.916 --> 28:29.250
Right.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.975
- Cheers!
- Yeah!

29:28.852 --> 29:32.022
Have a look at you.
Drinking like a soldier.

29:32.105 --> 29:33.231
Soldier?

29:33.314 --> 29:36.735
Tubby, if you want to get corn-holed
and killed,

29:36.818 --> 29:38.028
join the football team.

29:38.069 --> 29:41.781
Come, bill, it's about time
we showed a little get up and go.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.659
- We're gonna learn a trade.
- A trade?

29:44.743 --> 29:45.785
You've got a trade.

29:45.869 --> 29:46.953
Doing what?

29:47.037 --> 29:50.707
Mate, all I do is chase around cattle
all day, rooter cuts their balls off,

29:50.790 --> 29:51.916
and JJ...

29:52.000 --> 29:54.669
Fuck, we don't even know what JJ does.

29:55.337 --> 29:56.379
And you know what?

29:56.421 --> 29:59.299
It doesn't pay shit.
Mate, the army's got the lot.

29:59.382 --> 30:02.469
Hard yakka. Danger. Tax breaks.

30:04.262 --> 30:06.181
- What sort of danger?
- Come on, rooter.

30:06.264 --> 30:07.766
A little thing called warfare.

30:07.849 --> 30:08.892
With who?

30:08.975 --> 30:11.519
We're Australian, mate. We don't care.

30:11.603 --> 30:13.897
Boys, boys, boys.
You gotta think this through.

30:14.939 --> 30:17.942
The army's no picnic. The danger's real.

30:18.860 --> 30:19.986
It's real.

30:21.738 --> 30:23.740
What about e-cow?

30:23.782 --> 30:24.908
What's e-cow?

30:24.949 --> 30:26.659
It's a good concept, I'll give him that.

30:26.743 --> 30:29.079
All right, you sponsor
a cow, it's $2 a day.

30:29.162 --> 30:31.206
We send you pictures,
you get updates and that.

30:31.289 --> 30:32.916
And eventually, you get to eat it.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.084
That is good.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.251
It's a great idea!

30:35.335 --> 30:37.087
It's too much hard work, lads, yeah?

30:37.170 --> 30:38.171
Look at me.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.756
The army is the answer. All right?

30:40.799 --> 30:41.883
Remember? Come on.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.428
And you... hey!

30:45.512 --> 30:48.598
Are you gonna be
stewing in your juice all night?

30:48.682 --> 30:51.017
Bloody conga line out of the door.

30:51.101 --> 30:52.185
This is all your fault.

30:52.602 --> 30:53.603
My fault?

30:53.687 --> 30:54.771
Lucy.

30:54.813 --> 30:56.439
She'd stay if you stayed.

30:56.481 --> 31:00.151
Come on, bill.
Wake up and smell the proverbial.

31:01.611 --> 31:04.531
Well, I'm gonna show her
where the party's at.

31:04.614 --> 31:05.782
Yeah, good boy.

31:06.950 --> 31:09.630
<i>We're gonna need a bit more rocket fuel
than that, though, compadre.</i>

31:11.454 --> 31:12.497
Hey, lads.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.582
I've thought of a new drinking game.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.210
We all drink as much as we can...

31:21.423 --> 31:22.716
And that's it. Come on.

31:22.799 --> 31:24.050
That's good.

31:35.437 --> 31:36.438
Bill?

31:37.856 --> 31:39.441
William?

31:42.318 --> 31:44.612
Jeez, I'd close your mouth, mate.
The flies might get in.

31:46.031 --> 31:47.282
What are you gawking at?

31:47.365 --> 31:48.575
Sis!

31:48.658 --> 31:52.370
You look positively pulchritudinous.

31:52.454 --> 31:54.748
- Luce, you look beautiful.
- Thanks, sparrow.

31:56.666 --> 31:58.835
Come on, Princess, get it over with.

31:58.918 --> 32:01.129
I'm sure you've got
some smartarse thing to say.

32:02.672 --> 32:03.673
No.

32:04.341 --> 32:06.634
No, I don't, honest.

32:08.053 --> 32:09.346
It's just that...

32:09.387 --> 32:10.680
Just what?

32:11.806 --> 32:13.808
It's like seeing my brother in a dress.

32:28.448 --> 32:29.908
Shickety split, Billy.

32:29.991 --> 32:31.868
You're a smooth-talking bastard.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.286
What?

32:33.370 --> 32:34.996
Never seen her dressed like a...

32:35.955 --> 32:36.956
- A girl.
- Yeah.

32:37.040 --> 32:39.143
And she's probably
never gonna dress like one again, mate.

32:39.167 --> 32:41.378
- What was I supposed to say?
- Not that.

32:41.461 --> 32:43.338
Yeah. See, even sparrow gets it.

32:43.421 --> 32:45.090
Like, when I'm wooing a woman...

32:45.173 --> 32:47.050
I'm not "wooing" her.

32:47.092 --> 32:50.553
I put on a little bit of classical music,
I compliment her appearance.

32:51.012 --> 32:53.390
I play Keith urban and get her drunk.

32:53.431 --> 32:55.892
I'm not wooing Lucy, okay?

32:57.185 --> 33:00.105
She's a mate. A good mate.

33:00.522 --> 33:01.898
It was a shock.

33:02.899 --> 33:04.275
Keith urban, eh?

33:04.984 --> 33:06.319
Yeah.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.222
Why'd you have to say
Lucy looked like your brother?

33:38.893 --> 33:40.478
Are you mental? He's got a beard.

33:40.562 --> 33:42.355
It came out all wrong.

33:42.439 --> 33:44.858
That is not how you talk to a lady.

33:44.941 --> 33:46.109
Like you'd know.

33:46.151 --> 33:48.194
No, I'm making
some serious headway with Mary.

33:49.112 --> 33:51.072
Don't you worry about that.

33:52.115 --> 33:53.616
You got to apologize to Luce, though,

33:53.700 --> 33:56.161
'cause if she leaves,
that is the end of the team.

33:56.953 --> 33:58.038
Don't panic.

33:58.455 --> 34:01.332
I'll apologize, turn on the charm.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.877
She'll be eating out of
the palm of my hand.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.462
Good.

34:10.467 --> 34:11.551
Skull! Skull! Skull!

34:11.634 --> 34:14.471
Skull! Skull! Skull!

34:14.596 --> 34:16.306
Skull! Skull! Skull! Skull! Skull! Skull!

34:19.351 --> 34:21.853
The juggernaut!

34:21.936 --> 34:23.563
Yay!

34:28.902 --> 34:31.321
Michelle, I don't look
like a boy in this, do I?

34:32.322 --> 34:34.157
Definitely not.

34:35.867 --> 34:37.202
Look at him.

34:37.284 --> 34:39.579
He said he's gonna
give up the grog after this.

34:39.661 --> 34:40.746
For the baby.

34:40.830 --> 34:43.500
- How did he take the news?
- I haven't told him yet.

34:44.458 --> 34:46.378
'Cause Boof's always getting between us.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.920
You have to tell him.

34:48.004 --> 34:49.339
It's not his baby.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.675
Skull! Skull! Skull!

34:51.757 --> 34:53.510
It's gonna be the end of us.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.344
You should've thought of that before.

34:55.887 --> 34:57.138
Yeah!

35:02.894 --> 35:04.688
Bush.

35:04.771 --> 35:06.523
Nah. No bush, mate.

35:06.564 --> 35:08.358
Yeah, nah, I reckon there's bush.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.110
Absolutely no bush.

35:10.193 --> 35:11.861
I like bush.

35:11.903 --> 35:13.905
I can get lost in it for days.

35:14.656 --> 35:15.865
Wrong bush.

35:16.199 --> 35:19.994
Hey, I wouldn't.
She looks awfully sober, mate.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.337
You seen Lucy?

35:29.379 --> 35:30.547
Watch.

35:31.506 --> 35:36.177
The fearless JJ's making his move.
Look at him. Swift, like a grasshopper.

35:39.222 --> 35:40.223
Piss off.

35:46.730 --> 35:48.773
Looks like the master's
gonna have to show the way.

35:50.775 --> 35:52.152
Hello, madam.

35:53.028 --> 35:55.071
Yeah. I was...

35:55.155 --> 35:58.533
Just wondering if you would care
to sashay onto the dance floor.

35:59.409 --> 36:02.287
My, my. A talking dog.

36:13.048 --> 36:14.758
She is a bit sober.

36:15.884 --> 36:17.218
Bugger her.

36:17.510 --> 36:18.636
Bugger 'em all.

36:19.346 --> 36:21.264
None of 'em have got Merline's brains.

36:21.306 --> 36:22.557
Or Taylah's drive.

36:22.599 --> 36:25.602
Yeah, or Shazza's vagina.

36:28.897 --> 36:30.607
Hey, you gotta stay here, okay.

36:30.690 --> 36:31.983
This is private.

36:41.159 --> 36:42.744
Hi, Mary.

36:42.786 --> 36:43.912
I...

36:46.289 --> 36:48.049
Just wanted to grab
your advice on something.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.627
- My advice?
- Yeah.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.800
Well, if you keep your hands off it,
the rash should clear up in no time.

36:56.716 --> 36:57.801
No.

36:57.842 --> 37:00.470
Actually, I've just got this friend
who's dead keen on this girl,

37:00.553 --> 37:02.430
but he can't read her face.

37:02.472 --> 37:03.640
That ugly, huh?

37:03.723 --> 37:05.183
No, no, she's got something special.

37:05.892 --> 37:06.935
Adam's apple?

37:07.977 --> 37:09.187
Well, she's very handy.

37:09.813 --> 37:10.980
She's a bull dyke, then.

37:11.064 --> 37:13.817
Yeah, the thought had crossed my...
No, no, no way.

37:13.858 --> 37:15.735
And if she is, then god is a bastard.

37:16.903 --> 37:20.740
I'd say this chick sounds like a loudmouth,
bangle-rattling bushpig.

37:20.824 --> 37:25.704
But if your mate really wants to root her,
he should grab her and kiss her,

37:25.787 --> 37:27.664
and be a man about it.

37:30.583 --> 37:32.794
Yeah. Sounds like a great plan, Mary.

37:33.211 --> 37:34.295
I'm moving to Perth.

37:34.337 --> 37:36.006
- What?
- Yeah.

37:36.089 --> 37:38.133
I'm gonna try out
for the Olympic wrestling team.

37:39.009 --> 37:43.388
Get a career, put it in a half-Nelson
and slam it to the mat.

37:44.055 --> 37:45.473
Then I win gold for Australia.

37:45.515 --> 37:48.018
No, no, no, no! You can't move to Perth.
That's too far away.

37:48.101 --> 37:49.686
Try and stop me.

37:52.605 --> 37:54.774
Yeah, yeah. No. Yeah. No worries.

37:55.191 --> 37:56.484
Thanks, Mary.

37:56.526 --> 37:58.069
And get some cream for that rash.

37:58.153 --> 37:59.738
Yeah. Yeah.

38:14.419 --> 38:17.380
You don't look like my brother
in a dress, okay?

38:18.131 --> 38:20.175
Look, Luce, I didn't mean anything bad.

38:20.425 --> 38:21.843
You're my mate.

38:21.885 --> 38:24.387
So it's like seeing
one of your mates in a dress?

38:24.888 --> 38:26.014
Yeah.

38:26.514 --> 38:27.724
I...

38:27.766 --> 38:30.352
I mean, you look great not wearing a dress.

38:32.020 --> 38:34.898
I don't mean you look great naked.

38:35.065 --> 38:37.108
Just gets better and better with you,
doesn't it?

38:40.403 --> 38:42.655
Okay, Princess, take a breath.

38:43.239 --> 38:44.240
You want a root?

38:44.908 --> 38:46.117
What?

38:46.201 --> 38:47.952
A root. Sex.

38:48.411 --> 38:50.538
Might as well get it out of the way.

38:50.580 --> 38:51.581
Really?

38:51.664 --> 38:52.874
I'm up for it if you are.

38:52.957 --> 38:54.084
Yeah?

38:54.834 --> 38:56.002
So you haven't picked one?

38:58.254 --> 39:00.674
Are we setting each other
up for roots or what?

39:04.094 --> 39:05.762
I dunno, I haven't picked one yet.

39:05.804 --> 39:08.139
Chop-chop. Meanwhile...

39:08.765 --> 39:10.266
Set me up with him.

39:12.394 --> 39:15.021
- The one in the hat?
- Blue suit.

39:16.064 --> 39:17.565
Okay.

39:18.066 --> 39:19.609
Have you finished yet?

39:21.111 --> 39:23.988
Get me the legs 'n' lips in the blue dress.

39:24.948 --> 39:25.990
She's out of your league.

39:26.366 --> 39:27.992
You're right. Look who's talking.

39:33.957 --> 39:36.077
This is the last favor I'm doing you.
Then we're done.

39:36.793 --> 39:38.211
- Good.
- Good.

39:39.462 --> 39:43.049
I'm all over the fairy lights.
Lo-fi. Retro.

39:43.133 --> 39:45.176
It's Woodstock for rednecks.

39:47.095 --> 39:49.180
I'm getting a drink. You?

39:49.264 --> 39:50.557
What?

39:56.604 --> 39:57.772
G'day, mate.

40:02.902 --> 40:04.029
You're wearing sandals.

40:04.571 --> 40:07.490
Yeah, brah.
Gotta minimize that carbon footprint.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.452
Huh, right?

40:11.661 --> 40:14.164
- What're you drinking?
- Rum.

40:15.665 --> 40:18.710
Organic, yeah?
Ethically sourced? Fair trade?

40:20.253 --> 40:21.546
Yeah, all right.

40:27.427 --> 40:28.803
So, where you from, mate?

40:28.845 --> 40:30.055
Sydney.

40:32.599 --> 40:34.768
- What do you do?
- Aviation.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.356
- Light planes?
- No, a380s.

40:39.439 --> 40:40.899
The big ones.

40:44.277 --> 40:45.570
I think you've got a problem.

40:48.365 --> 40:49.741
See that chick?

40:50.575 --> 40:52.452
She's taken a shine to you.

40:53.745 --> 40:55.497
- Cool.
- Not cool.

40:55.538 --> 40:57.040
Definitely not cool.

40:57.123 --> 40:58.833
Nice rack. Tasty.

40:58.917 --> 41:02.003
What? No, look, do yourself a favor.

41:02.712 --> 41:04.589
- Steer clear.
- I like her energy.

41:04.673 --> 41:06.049
She's got a good energy about her.

41:06.091 --> 41:07.967
- Wait. She's done time...
- Huh?

41:08.551 --> 41:10.261
For armed robbery.

41:11.638 --> 41:12.639
Bullshit!

41:13.848 --> 41:16.267
She doesn't look like
that kind of girl, does she?

41:16.726 --> 41:21.106
Trust me, she only started
looking like a girl tonight.

41:26.194 --> 41:27.195
Just in time.

41:34.744 --> 41:37.497
But, darling,
there simply has to be some vodka.

41:38.164 --> 41:39.833
We have rum and beer.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.252
Fine. Get me a rum. A big one.

41:42.335 --> 41:43.503
Make that two.

41:44.963 --> 41:47.007
- You've got a stalker.
- Pardon?

41:47.215 --> 41:48.591
See that bloke over there?

41:52.137 --> 41:53.805
He's been watching you.

41:54.264 --> 41:56.099
Whatevs, every time I turn around,

41:56.182 --> 41:58.560
some creep's giving me
a pap smear with his eyes.

41:58.643 --> 42:00.270
You can't be from around here.

42:00.353 --> 42:02.605
Born and bred. You're not.

42:02.689 --> 42:04.024
Wait a mo.

42:04.107 --> 42:05.442
You and the cowboy...

42:05.525 --> 42:06.568
You're not a couple?

42:06.609 --> 42:07.694
No.

42:11.865 --> 42:13.283
I'm over the guys in Sydney.

42:13.575 --> 42:16.661
- I want someone genuine, real.
- Wait a second...

42:16.745 --> 42:18.246
He looks real.

42:18.288 --> 42:19.497
He's too real.

42:19.581 --> 42:22.375
- Introduce me.
- No. Not him.

42:22.459 --> 42:24.294
He seems very what-you-see-is-what-you-get.

42:24.377 --> 42:25.712
Yeah, that's all you get.

42:25.795 --> 42:28.173
That's all I want. No secrets.
No skeletons.

42:28.256 --> 42:29.466
No brains?

42:29.507 --> 42:30.717
Perfect.

42:31.384 --> 42:33.762
He has sex with sheep.

42:36.348 --> 42:37.724
I've done worse.

42:48.902 --> 42:50.987
What do you want? I'm busy.

42:51.029 --> 42:52.322
Perth, eh?

42:52.989 --> 42:54.824
Perth is a long way away.

42:55.492 --> 42:56.993
Well, at least it's got real men.

42:57.410 --> 42:58.787
Not like the pussies around here.

42:58.828 --> 43:00.663
- I'm not a pussy, Mary.
- Did you speak?

43:01.915 --> 43:03.333
No.

43:07.253 --> 43:09.172
I mean, won't you be lonely, Mary?

43:10.965 --> 43:12.550
All by yourself?

43:14.928 --> 43:17.764
You could get a manager.
You know, someone who can protect you.

43:19.724 --> 43:22.018
- Sparrow, go get a Biro.
- A Biro?

43:22.102 --> 43:23.228
A Biro.

43:23.311 --> 43:24.789
And then mark on your body
where you'd like me

43:24.813 --> 43:25.897
to tear that new arsehole.

43:32.445 --> 43:34.864
She is startin' to crack.

43:37.575 --> 43:38.910
Thanks, beautiful.

43:39.744 --> 43:41.184
You sure you're up for this, Podgie?

43:41.996 --> 43:43.373
Don't panic, Michelle, all right?

43:43.456 --> 43:46.918
I've got bloody
vitamin supplements, stethoscope.

43:47.002 --> 43:49.087
Skull! Skull! Skull!

43:49.212 --> 43:51.673
Skull! Skull! Skull! Skull! Skull! Skull!

43:55.218 --> 43:57.053
Right-o. Next can.

44:05.270 --> 44:07.772
I've never been overseas. Must be exciting.

44:07.856 --> 44:10.567
Yeah. Well, wouldn't be as cray-cray
as what you're used to.

44:15.655 --> 44:16.781
Your dress is mint.

44:17.532 --> 44:19.909
- It's smokin'. It's hot.
- Really?

44:19.993 --> 44:21.077
It's babelicious.

44:21.161 --> 44:23.246
- Babelicious?
- Absolutes.

44:25.206 --> 44:26.499
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

44:37.427 --> 44:38.928
Sheep, huh?

44:39.971 --> 44:42.974
Wouldn't have thought a man like you
would ever get that desperate.

44:45.727 --> 44:46.895
Sheep?

44:46.936 --> 44:48.730
It's fine by me.

44:48.772 --> 44:50.231
I'm very adventurous.

44:54.152 --> 44:56.821
Listen, I know who you've been
talking to and...

44:56.905 --> 44:57.947
You're really cut.

44:58.448 --> 45:01.242
But not like gym cut. It's refreshing.

45:02.243 --> 45:04.287
Be a darling, grab me a drink. Rum.

45:04.371 --> 45:05.789
Hold the olive.

45:06.498 --> 45:10.168
Look, I'm sorry. You're not my type.

45:13.797 --> 45:15.757
But I'm everyone's type.

45:15.799 --> 45:18.301
So, basically,
things can get pretty extreme up there.

45:18.385 --> 45:20.470
There's a lot of pressure. Lives at stake.

45:20.512 --> 45:22.597
Kinda like robbing banks.

45:22.972 --> 45:24.307
- What?
- Look, it's fine.

45:24.391 --> 45:26.935
I heard all about it.
You're a bit of a firecracker.

45:33.441 --> 45:36.486
Excuse me a minute,
I have to go and kill someone.

45:38.655 --> 45:41.825
Busy girl. How you doing?

45:48.123 --> 45:50.291
- Hey!
- Armed robbery?

45:51.501 --> 45:53.211
I don't remember what I said exactly,

45:53.294 --> 45:56.006
but the conversation
was frank and wide-ranging.

45:56.089 --> 45:58.425
The deal was to set me up,
not shoot me in the foot.

45:58.508 --> 45:59.676
And the sheep thing?

46:00.510 --> 46:02.470
That's your idea of being my wingman?

46:06.057 --> 46:08.101
Blimey! Heels! Ow!

46:09.477 --> 46:11.688
Just a minute, jackeroo.

46:11.771 --> 46:13.523
Why did you try to ruin my chances?

46:13.606 --> 46:14.941
Why'd you ruin mine?

46:16.026 --> 46:17.068
Jealous?

46:20.488 --> 46:23.700
When it comes to me and girls,
you've always been a spanner in the works.

46:23.783 --> 46:24.993
Now I see why.

46:25.076 --> 46:26.828
You don't need my help.

46:27.829 --> 46:29.873
Don't you sheepdog me.

46:33.668 --> 46:37.088
I should've seen it. There it was.

46:37.172 --> 46:38.506
All the time.

46:39.674 --> 46:40.675
A flicker.

46:42.177 --> 46:44.012
Get out of my way.

46:44.054 --> 46:46.389
Now I'm thinking about that day at the dam.

46:48.475 --> 46:49.684
When we were little.

46:51.519 --> 46:53.646
You saved me from drowning,

46:53.730 --> 46:55.231
and as I lay there,

46:58.401 --> 46:59.486
you kissed me.

47:00.779 --> 47:02.739
I was giving you oxygen!

47:03.573 --> 47:06.618
- Whatever it was, it worked.
- I was giving you oxygen!

47:06.701 --> 47:09.329
- Billy!
- Admit it. You like me.

47:09.746 --> 47:11.247
I don't go for cowboys.

47:11.289 --> 47:12.725
Why do you spend so much time with them?

47:12.749 --> 47:14.542
I swear I'll kick you in the gonads.

47:15.126 --> 47:16.711
More dirty talk.

47:18.797 --> 47:20.173
You're not my type.

47:22.592 --> 47:25.845
So, you won't mind if I stand this close.

47:26.930 --> 47:28.264
Stand where you want, Princess.

47:28.348 --> 47:31.434
Or this close?

47:32.519 --> 47:33.978
You're out of your mind.

47:34.729 --> 47:36.106
Not even...

47:37.232 --> 47:38.233
This close?

47:39.484 --> 47:43.530
The closer you get, the less I like you.

47:57.043 --> 47:58.795
- This is weird.
- Yeah, it is.

48:03.049 --> 48:04.968
But maybe we could get used to it.

48:06.177 --> 48:10.223
I dunno, maybe if you stay.

48:12.642 --> 48:14.144
Is this your plan b?

48:16.146 --> 48:18.732
Am I supposed to go weak at the brain
'cause we kiss?

48:20.650 --> 48:23.403
- You're a snake.
- I didn't plan this.

48:23.486 --> 48:24.946
You know I don't plan anything.

48:26.406 --> 48:27.490
God.

48:30.618 --> 48:32.328
It was more than oxygen.

48:32.787 --> 48:35.165
I should've saved my breath.

48:44.299 --> 48:45.842
I'm thumpin' undies, boys.

48:45.925 --> 48:48.386
- I gotta go first.
- It's me first.

48:48.470 --> 48:49.596
Don't...

48:49.679 --> 48:52.140
- It's me first.
- Stop screwin' around.

48:52.515 --> 48:53.683
Knock it off!

48:56.353 --> 48:58.688
Sorry, fellas. That is how I rock and roll.

49:07.781 --> 49:08.948
Shit.

49:14.371 --> 49:15.372
Shit.

49:21.878 --> 49:23.213
Toilet's broken.

49:25.840 --> 49:28.093
- He kissed me.
- He what?

49:29.719 --> 49:33.556
Wait. So he just grabbed you and
kissed you, right out of the blue?

49:33.598 --> 49:35.433
No, not really.

49:35.517 --> 49:38.311
- You kissed him?
- No, it just sort of...

49:39.729 --> 49:41.856
I mean, one second we were talking and...

49:43.525 --> 49:45.068
We were talking...

49:46.069 --> 49:49.531
God! Are you bastards
putting each other off?

49:49.739 --> 49:51.241
Here, come with me.

49:53.410 --> 49:55.745
Could you just tell me who kissed who?

49:55.787 --> 49:58.707
He did, all right? He did.

49:58.748 --> 50:00.125
Get off my tits.

50:00.208 --> 50:01.584
He only did it to make me stay.

50:02.002 --> 50:04.796
Dirty dog. Hang on...

50:04.879 --> 50:06.756
Maybe he's always had the hots for you.

50:06.798 --> 50:07.799
- What?
- Well...

50:07.882 --> 50:09.092
He's not a great communicator.

50:09.175 --> 50:10.260
He tried to kill me today.

50:10.343 --> 50:12.429
Maybe that's how he shows affection.

50:12.470 --> 50:13.596
I could've wrung his neck.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.349
And that is how you show yours.

50:18.143 --> 50:19.978
I'm just going to pretend
he never kissed me.

50:20.061 --> 50:23.857
Luce, you gotta ask yourself.
Was the kiss any good?

50:27.277 --> 50:28.570
You're not leaving?

50:28.611 --> 50:31.823
Nah. We're going another round.

50:31.906 --> 50:33.283
That's the spirit.

51:07.817 --> 51:10.695
Lots of guys here tonight.
Ya feelin' lucky?

51:10.779 --> 51:12.405
Hell no.

51:12.489 --> 51:14.157
Don't say that.

51:14.824 --> 51:16.326
Your prince will come.

51:17.160 --> 51:20.914
And when he does,
don't let anyone else come between you.

51:20.997 --> 51:23.750
He's your man and you're his woman.

51:27.253 --> 51:31.841
Mary, you just need someone
that sees the real you.

51:32.676 --> 51:34.636
You think my face is ugly.

51:34.678 --> 51:36.596
Cut that out!

51:37.138 --> 51:40.183
You are a diamond in the rough.

51:40.266 --> 51:41.851
Too rough.

51:42.310 --> 51:46.981
Look, there's gotta be
at least one boy you like here.

52:09.045 --> 52:10.213
Did I miss something?

52:11.881 --> 52:13.383
Sorry?

52:13.466 --> 52:15.468
Are there, like, bush rules?

52:15.552 --> 52:18.096
Some strange "bush" way of communicating,

52:18.179 --> 52:21.933
because in civilization,
it sounded like you snubbed me.

52:23.893 --> 52:25.812
What if I did?

52:25.895 --> 52:28.565
Well, forgive me if I'm a bit confused.

52:28.606 --> 52:30.900
Do you have a problem with your eyesight?

52:30.942 --> 52:32.068
Nope.

52:33.069 --> 52:35.405
- What, are you married?
- Hell no.

52:36.448 --> 52:37.449
Gay?

52:39.492 --> 52:40.785
Are these trick questions?

52:41.244 --> 52:45.749
Look, I think we got off
on the wrong foot here.

52:45.790 --> 52:47.959
You seem like a genuine guy.

52:48.084 --> 52:51.171
Up front. Down to earth.

52:52.505 --> 52:54.466
How could anyone resist?

53:09.856 --> 53:11.441
Shit.

53:14.861 --> 53:17.113
Hey, wait. Lucy.

53:18.114 --> 53:21.242
Look, I was just pissed off
and she was there and,

53:21.284 --> 53:22.369
I dunno...

53:22.452 --> 53:26.289
- Why did you kiss me?
- Hang on, you kissed me.

53:26.331 --> 53:27.791
- No way!
- Nah.

53:27.874 --> 53:31.461
You can't deny there was a bit
of licky-nibbly from your side.

53:31.503 --> 53:32.629
Bullshit.

53:33.546 --> 53:35.466
So what, you thought
you'd just mess with my head

53:35.507 --> 53:36.508
before you run away?

53:36.633 --> 53:38.778
And you thought you'd just mess with mine
so I wouldn't?

53:38.802 --> 53:41.137
Hey, it's the circle-work dude.

53:41.221 --> 53:43.807
- You're out of control.
- Yeah.

53:44.516 --> 53:45.934
What a team.

53:46.893 --> 53:48.645
Hey, how do I smell?

53:53.149 --> 53:54.275
Like I feel.

53:54.317 --> 53:56.319
Shickety.

53:56.361 --> 53:58.363
Me and Mary,
we just started gettin' our mojo.

53:58.488 --> 53:59.489
Yeah, right.

53:59.531 --> 54:02.409
No, no, serious, you know, we talked.
We really connected.

54:02.492 --> 54:05.212
And when it comes to Mary,
I'm telling you, I've got the magic touch.

54:05.829 --> 54:08.289
So it's all working out for sparrow McGee.

54:08.331 --> 54:11.334
Yeah, but she's moving to Perth.

54:11.418 --> 54:13.058
What do you reckon? Should I go with her?

54:14.838 --> 54:15.839
What?

54:15.880 --> 54:17.632
To manage her wrestling career.

54:19.884 --> 54:22.846
That'd be right. Another rat off the ship.

54:23.763 --> 54:25.140
What's wrong with everyone?

54:25.557 --> 54:28.018
Suddenly the country's
not good enough for ya.

54:28.476 --> 54:31.396
You're chuckin' all this
away, and for what?

54:33.189 --> 54:35.233
You're all bloody traitors.

54:35.358 --> 54:38.528
You haven't even told Mary how you feel,
'cause you're piss weak.

54:38.570 --> 54:39.863
Hey, don't say that.

54:40.238 --> 54:41.614
Piss weak.

54:44.200 --> 54:47.120
Hey, you shouldn't say things like that.
You know, you're my best mate.

54:47.203 --> 54:48.264
Mates don't say things like that. Mates...

54:48.288 --> 54:50.123
Fly away, sparrow.

54:50.206 --> 54:52.375
Fly away and don't come back.

54:58.381 --> 55:00.717
You know, I'm sick of being stuck
in the back of a Ute.

55:01.760 --> 55:03.887
But you want to stay here forever
and now I know why.

55:05.430 --> 55:07.057
'Cause you're scared, Billy.

55:08.391 --> 55:10.226
You're scared, not me.

55:16.066 --> 55:18.568
You're my best mate.
I dunno what I'd do without ya.

55:18.651 --> 55:20.028
You're a deadset bloody legend.

55:20.820 --> 55:22.739
- You are.
- No, mate, you are.

55:22.822 --> 55:24.574
You are.

55:40.423 --> 55:41.883
What?

55:56.773 --> 55:58.692
You're a deadset bloody legend.

55:58.775 --> 56:00.110
No, mate, you are, mate.

56:00.193 --> 56:02.362
- No, you are.
- Nah.

56:02.445 --> 56:04.114
You... you are.

56:05.156 --> 56:08.952
I see the good in you, turps.
Not many others can, but I do.

56:09.035 --> 56:10.870
I see it.

56:10.954 --> 56:13.623
- I love ya, mate.
- I love you, mate.

56:13.707 --> 56:15.250
I love you, mate.

56:15.291 --> 56:16.459
I love you, mate!

56:23.008 --> 56:24.134
No...

56:26.886 --> 56:28.471
Mate, I mean...

56:32.851 --> 56:34.144
I really love ya.

56:37.856 --> 56:39.232
Shit, mate.

56:56.666 --> 56:57.834
Hey.

57:00.045 --> 57:01.504
Did I scare you off?

57:01.546 --> 57:03.006
What? No.

57:03.048 --> 57:06.176
Okay, look, I didn't mean to get all up
in your business or anything like that.

57:06.259 --> 57:10.930
'Cause, you know, doing time
can leave some pretty big scars.

57:21.107 --> 57:22.734
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

57:24.069 --> 57:26.196
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>

57:26.237 --> 57:27.697
<i>I'm gonna sing you a song...</i>

57:27.781 --> 57:28.782
It's good.

57:29.074 --> 57:30.450
- About love.
- Two.

57:30.533 --> 57:33.036
One song, and that's it.

57:44.547 --> 57:48.343
That's the mother of my child.

59:12.177 --> 59:13.470
She's amazing!

59:19.184 --> 59:22.228
Anywhere in this place is...

59:32.739 --> 59:35.575
Man, I'm good. Good!

01:00:14.906 --> 01:00:16.032
Yeah!

01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:27.002
Let's dance.

01:02:33.837 --> 01:02:36.006
Hey, mate. How you going?
You having a good time?

01:02:36.089 --> 01:02:37.358
- Yeah, I'm having a good...
- Okay, time to say

01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:39.551
goodbye.

01:02:39.676 --> 01:02:41.052
But I'm not gonna... I'm good.

01:02:41.177 --> 01:02:42.262
Come on, Billy.

01:02:42.345 --> 01:02:43.680
- Good call.
- Good night, Billy.

01:02:43.722 --> 01:02:45.015
All right!

01:02:45.765 --> 01:02:47.350
Bedtime. Say goodbye.

01:02:58.862 --> 01:03:00.280
So what you never went to uni.

01:03:00.363 --> 01:03:03.033
I dropped out in first year.
It's too much reading.

01:03:03.533 --> 01:03:07.620
Hey. No, no, no. Good, I'm good.

01:03:07.704 --> 01:03:11.791
If you didn't finish university or
anything, how did you become a pilot?

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:13.376
Shut up!

01:03:16.546 --> 01:03:19.674
Actually, well... I'm not actually a pilot.

01:03:20.383 --> 01:03:22.385
- I'm cabin crew.
- You're a steward?

01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:25.513
Well, we prefer the term
"flight comfort engineer."

01:03:27.265 --> 01:03:29.142
Better than a jackeroo.

01:03:36.983 --> 01:03:38.568
I can't wait to see your guns.

01:03:39.152 --> 01:03:40.862
You don't waste time, do you?

01:04:01.299 --> 01:04:04.260
Okay. Yep.

01:04:20.276 --> 01:04:24.280
Dance, dance, dance,
in my beautiful golden shower.

01:04:26.366 --> 01:04:28.952
It's the world's first beer windmill!

01:04:30.787 --> 01:04:32.580
This is what heaven must feel like.

01:04:32.622 --> 01:04:36.042
This is sparrow's
most ingenious contraption yet!

01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:40.338
'Til the beer runs out.

01:04:41.548 --> 01:04:43.299
The final can. For the record.

01:04:44.175 --> 01:04:45.719
Here we go!

01:04:45.802 --> 01:04:48.096
- Focus, focus, focus.
- You okay?

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.390
I reckon I've had enough.

01:04:51.474 --> 01:04:53.476
We didn't come this far for you to fail.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.686
Boof, he's had enough.

01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:55.895
All right!

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:58.857
- Podge... Darren.
- Huh?

01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:01.985
You know I've loved you since my heart
was big enough to beat, right?

01:05:04.904 --> 01:05:07.157
- Jesus!
- Sit down, 'Chelle.

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:12.328
Well, there was this patient
at the hospital, on my rounds.

01:05:13.705 --> 01:05:17.167
He was dying. It was so awful.

01:05:18.168 --> 01:05:23.757
And his last request before he died
was to make love to a beautiful woman.

01:05:25.175 --> 01:05:27.010
You're a beautiful woman.

01:05:27.427 --> 01:05:29.262
Don't you see?

01:05:29.346 --> 01:05:32.182
I couldn't say no, not to a dying man.

01:05:33.683 --> 01:05:35.477
- So he died?
- No.

01:05:36.519 --> 01:05:38.229
He got better and went back to Wangaratta.

01:05:38.355 --> 01:05:39.856
But that's not the point.

01:05:42.567 --> 01:05:44.611
What about the baby? Is...

01:05:44.694 --> 01:05:48.490
- Is the baby all right?
- Yeah, the baby's fine.

01:05:48.531 --> 01:05:52.535
But, Darren, it's not yours.

01:05:59.042 --> 01:06:00.126
Okay.

01:06:00.752 --> 01:06:02.712
Did... did you hear what I said?

01:06:03.963 --> 01:06:05.965
- The baby's not yours.
- But it's yours.

01:06:06.633 --> 01:06:07.676
What...

01:06:07.717 --> 01:06:10.095
And that's enough for me.

01:06:11.221 --> 01:06:15.350
Besides, I like it that
you're up for it all the time.

01:06:15.392 --> 01:06:17.185
I love you, Podge.

01:06:18.478 --> 01:06:20.355
We're the best team ever.

01:06:23.316 --> 01:06:25.652
I'm done with beer.

01:06:25.735 --> 01:06:27.529
I got somethin' better.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:37.747
Hey, it's stopped.

01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:39.749
- Hey, where's the beer?
- What's going on?

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.628
What? No.

01:06:43.753 --> 01:06:45.630
You better get that thing working again.

01:06:45.755 --> 01:06:48.091
Don't worry, folks.
There's plenty more beer.

01:06:48.174 --> 01:06:49.718
There's no more beer.

01:06:50.427 --> 01:06:53.263
Folks, if you need a beer,
just suck on your clothes

01:06:53.304 --> 01:06:55.181
and that'll help with the beer stains, too.

01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:56.933
You used all the beer.

01:06:56.975 --> 01:06:58.393
- Yeah. We need beer.
- Beer!

01:06:58.435 --> 01:07:01.771
Look, fellas, I would not mess with me.
It's been a very emotional night.

01:07:02.939 --> 01:07:05.692
And what are we gonna do about that?

01:07:07.527 --> 01:07:08.611
Mudfight?

01:07:09.654 --> 01:07:10.780
Fair enough.

01:07:13.283 --> 01:07:14.951
Mudfight!

01:07:15.952 --> 01:07:17.203
Mudfight!

01:07:33.511 --> 01:07:34.804
A tough guy, have we?

01:07:36.348 --> 01:07:37.640
Not exactly.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:41.186
My legs are a little bit trembly
from rooting your mum all night.

01:07:45.315 --> 01:07:48.526
- Your mum, too.
- We've got the same mum.

01:07:48.651 --> 01:07:50.695
But I'm guessing, not the same dad?

01:07:51.446 --> 01:07:52.822
What?

01:08:05.043 --> 01:08:06.836
Thanks, Billy.

01:08:14.511 --> 01:08:16.429
Seen it. Seen it.

01:08:18.348 --> 01:08:19.599
Seen it.

01:08:25.063 --> 01:08:28.358
And that's what you call kickass-ercise.

01:08:29.526 --> 01:08:31.861
Mary, there's something I gotta say.

01:08:31.903 --> 01:08:33.697
You are the most...

01:08:40.537 --> 01:08:43.957
Mary, I'm really glad
we got to spend this time together.

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.041
You are just...

01:08:54.216 --> 01:08:56.553
You're a goddess. A Princess.

01:08:57.554 --> 01:08:58.555
What did you call me?

01:08:59.555 --> 01:09:01.057
Why'd you have to say his name?

01:09:02.058 --> 01:09:03.393
You know a guy named Princess?

01:09:04.644 --> 01:09:07.063
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

01:09:07.147 --> 01:09:08.732
Wait, wait, wait. You're not leaving.

01:09:08.773 --> 01:09:11.734
- I'm sorry. It's not you.
- Yeah!

01:09:11.776 --> 01:09:13.295
No, don't go. Please, come back. Don't go.

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:15.196
I'm never coming back.

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:26.957
Ladies.

01:09:33.965 --> 01:09:35.050
I'm okay with that.

01:09:39.970 --> 01:09:41.348
I'm Nic.

01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:44.559
Mary.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.381
You're beautiful and I love you.

01:09:49.647 --> 01:09:51.858
You're my woman. I'm your man.

01:09:52.901 --> 01:09:53.902
Deal with it.

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:12.003
I've done it, Billy.
I've declared myself. It's on.

01:10:14.089 --> 01:10:16.633
I always knew you would, mate.

01:10:16.675 --> 01:10:18.259
When you know, you know!

01:10:32.190 --> 01:10:33.274
Easy.

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:35.360
Hey, easy, Billy. Come on, eh!

01:10:35.443 --> 01:10:37.821
There's no reason for
fighting to be violent.

01:11:05.849 --> 01:11:08.143
Hey, bill. Come on, mate.

01:11:08.184 --> 01:11:10.520
Cut it out! Cut it out!

01:11:15.483 --> 01:11:16.943
Bill!

01:11:22.198 --> 01:11:23.241
Jesus.

01:11:33.168 --> 01:11:35.295
You could've hurt me, you dickhead.

01:13:07.512 --> 01:13:09.305
Last night was...

01:13:09.431 --> 01:13:11.808
- I don't remember a thing.
- Me neither.

01:13:15.311 --> 01:13:16.646
Tell you what, though.

01:13:17.605 --> 01:13:19.190
I'm comin' back next year.

01:13:21.192 --> 01:13:22.569
Hell, yeah.

01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.145
Has your guy flown the Coop?

01:13:57.187 --> 01:13:58.813
He's not my guy.

01:13:59.647 --> 01:14:01.691
What happens in the paddock
stays in the paddock.

01:14:01.816 --> 01:14:03.234
Nothing happened in the paddock.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.070
No need to explain.

01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:08.490
- Listen...
- Me first.

01:14:10.658 --> 01:14:12.202
I've had a bit of a think.

01:14:13.036 --> 01:14:14.371
So have I.

01:14:16.206 --> 01:14:18.083
I've made a fool of myself.

01:14:19.584 --> 01:14:21.586
And I'm holding you back.

01:14:23.588 --> 01:14:25.632
You always wanted to go.

01:14:27.008 --> 01:14:28.218
So, go.

01:14:30.261 --> 01:14:31.554
You're a fool.

01:14:32.222 --> 01:14:35.308
- I just said that.
- A gumnut-sucking twit.

01:14:35.392 --> 01:14:36.476
That's new.

01:14:37.435 --> 01:14:39.020
But you're not an arsehole.

01:14:43.441 --> 01:14:44.567
You could come with me.

01:14:47.112 --> 01:14:49.030
Listen, I don't know
what happened last night,

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.574
but something happened.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.285
Billy, you've always been there.

01:14:55.912 --> 01:14:57.792
I don't know
what life will be like without you.

01:14:59.457 --> 01:15:01.084
I don't think I'll like it.

01:15:02.877 --> 01:15:04.087
Then stay.

01:15:05.213 --> 01:15:08.091
I love it here, but I need more.

01:15:08.967 --> 01:15:10.802
So will you.

01:15:12.303 --> 01:15:13.763
Come with me.

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.933
I can't.

01:15:18.101 --> 01:15:20.770
- Why not?
- Because I'd drive you crazy.

01:15:20.812 --> 01:15:22.605
- I'd ruin everything for you.
- Billy...

01:15:22.647 --> 01:15:25.608
Luce, no matter where
you go, you'll be fine.

01:15:26.776 --> 01:15:28.278
But for me,

01:15:30.113 --> 01:15:31.614
it doesn't get any better than this.

01:15:32.782 --> 01:15:34.784
You want to freewheel it,

01:15:35.785 --> 01:15:37.454
so let's freewheel it.

01:15:43.752 --> 01:15:45.420
We had a good run.

01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:49.466
Let it go, Luce.

01:16:17.994 --> 01:16:19.662
So, I've decided.

01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:21.623
We're staying here.

01:16:21.664 --> 01:16:22.749
You've decided?

01:16:23.625 --> 01:16:25.585
I'm the man in the relationship.

01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:33.635
Mary.

01:16:40.392 --> 01:16:41.851
Barrel of biscuits.

01:16:44.062 --> 01:16:45.855
Hey, you know, there's a...

01:16:45.897 --> 01:16:47.774
There is a cooling off period.

01:16:47.857 --> 01:16:49.693
I've definitely cooled off.

01:16:50.777 --> 01:16:52.987
What about the soldier's life?

01:16:53.905 --> 01:16:56.157
- E-cow's the future.
- Yeah.

01:16:56.199 --> 01:16:58.576
- Isn't that right, rooter?
- Yeah.

01:16:58.702 --> 01:17:02.205
And, of course,
I'm gonna need JJ for moral support.

01:17:02.872 --> 01:17:05.834
No. I'm going. So's Taylah.

01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:07.585
What?

01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:08.712
I'm gonna be a sniper.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.549
Haven't seen that.

01:17:17.053 --> 01:17:18.555
Well, there you go, Shazz.

01:17:18.638 --> 01:17:21.224
- Looks like love won the day.
- Yeah.

01:17:22.017 --> 01:17:24.394
That and you got the
shit kicked out of you.

01:17:25.186 --> 01:17:26.187
Indeed.

01:17:42.579 --> 01:17:45.206
Never again, little brother.

01:17:46.041 --> 01:17:48.918
This is not what I meant by "real."

01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:55.592
I think...

01:17:56.718 --> 01:17:58.303
I might join a gun club.

01:17:59.554 --> 01:18:01.222
You really are adopted.

01:18:18.573 --> 01:18:20.158
Yeah, we stalled!

01:18:20.241 --> 01:18:22.452
We stalled!

01:18:34.464 --> 01:18:35.840
Hey, Billy.

01:18:36.841 --> 01:18:38.134
Guess what?

01:18:41.846 --> 01:18:43.390
Me and Mary are staying.

01:18:44.265 --> 01:18:46.643
It was my idea and she totally went for it.

01:18:49.562 --> 01:18:50.605
Where's Luce?

01:18:59.906 --> 01:19:01.574
Shickety.

01:19:05.829 --> 01:19:08.248
I know love isn't meant to be easy.

01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:09.833
I mean, look at me and Mary.

01:19:13.169 --> 01:19:15.005
I just always figured, you know.

01:19:15.714 --> 01:19:16.881
You're a jackeroo.

01:19:17.716 --> 01:19:19.801
Lucy's a jilleroo.

01:19:21.177 --> 01:19:23.471
I thought you guys were
made for each other.

01:19:25.015 --> 01:19:27.809
I mean, that day by the river
when she gave you the kiss of life?

01:19:27.851 --> 01:19:28.935
Magic!

01:19:30.687 --> 01:19:33.940
You know, for years you've been telling me
to man up to Mary, but you?

01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:39.672
You won't even tell Lucy how you...

01:19:39.696 --> 01:19:40.864
Billy?

01:19:44.242 --> 01:19:46.077
Run, you muttonhead!

01:19:47.871 --> 01:19:50.206
Run! Go get her!

01:20:03.678 --> 01:20:05.764
Shickety-splickety-shit.

01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:09.142
It's on.

01:20:12.103 --> 01:20:13.563
It's happening!

01:20:13.605 --> 01:20:16.274
Billy and Lucy! It's happening!

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.568
To the old quarry!

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:20.320
Billy and Lucy!

01:20:20.403 --> 01:20:21.863
- Shit.
- Come on!

01:20:22.655 --> 01:20:24.115
Go! Go, go, go!

01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:26.034
Come on, 'Chelle.

01:20:35.919 --> 01:20:37.545
They're heading to the quarry!

01:20:45.095 --> 01:20:46.096
You all right, hon?

01:20:46.429 --> 01:20:47.972
Oi, hold up.

01:21:00.151 --> 01:21:02.153
- Sparrow!
- Billy's going for it.

01:21:02.612 --> 01:21:04.698
- To the quarry.
- Yes!

01:21:05.615 --> 01:21:07.701
He's fighting for the love of his life!

01:22:01.504 --> 01:22:03.673
I knew it! There they are!

01:23:12.909 --> 01:23:17.122
Oh, my god. The lazy Susan.

01:24:10.925 --> 01:24:13.470
- Yes!
- Yeah!

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.100
You can't sheepdog me.

01:24:19.142 --> 01:24:20.352
I want to be with you.

01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:23.605
I don't care how. I don't care where.

01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:26.816
Town to town. Sydney.

01:24:27.817 --> 01:24:29.110
As long as it's with you.

01:24:32.822 --> 01:24:34.616
I love you, Lucy.

01:24:40.789 --> 01:24:42.582
It doesn't get any better than you.

01:24:45.835 --> 01:24:47.796
Don't get all soppy on me now, Princess.

01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:13.530
Hold me.

01:25:18.201 --> 01:25:19.536
It's love.
