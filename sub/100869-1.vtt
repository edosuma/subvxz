WEBVTT

00:33.563 --> 00:34.864
Lots of love!

00:53.075 --> 00:55.544
What? You little mutt!

00:55.610 --> 00:57.179
- Come back here!
- Oh!

00:57.245 --> 00:59.382
Bring back my gyros!

00:59.449 --> 01:01.115
Hey, watch it!

01:01.182 --> 01:02.216
Excuse me.

01:02.283 --> 01:03.517
Pardon me. Whoa!

01:03.584 --> 01:05.251
- Hey! Bone-headed pooch!
- Sorry!

01:05.319 --> 01:07.288
Ruh-roh!

01:07.356 --> 01:10.757
Dispatch, I've got a stray dog
on a tube of compressed meat.

01:12.292 --> 01:15.562
Repeat. I have
a grand theft gyro in progress.

01:15.628 --> 01:17.763
Hey, slow it down!

01:19.298 --> 01:20.599
Huh?

01:20.666 --> 01:22.768
Yikes. Whoa!

01:24.403 --> 01:25.536
Hey!

01:35.012 --> 01:35.979
Zoinks!

01:37.180 --> 01:39.249
Like, slow down, dude.

<i>Welcome to another episode

02:07.040 --> 02:10.443
Friends, Who Needs Them?
You Do.

Whew!

02:32.595 --> 02:33.663
Huh?

02:35.799 --> 02:38.600
Make friends. Check.

02:42.071 --> 02:44.972
Nice to meet you,
Shelly and Sandy.

02:47.642 --> 02:48.976
How was your day?

02:49.043 --> 02:53.347
Oh, you want me to start?
How polite, Sandy.

02:53.414 --> 02:57.250
Well, I told my mom I was
meeting my pals at the beach.

02:57.318 --> 02:58.585
So, if she asks,

02:58.652 --> 03:01.354
this technically counts
as a playdate.

03:01.421 --> 03:05.525
But it's all good.
I like eating lunch by myself.

03:05.591 --> 03:07.892
And hanging out by myself.

03:09.761 --> 03:12.130
And playing ping-pong
by myself.

03:13.466 --> 03:15.033
I lose a lot of balls.

03:19.670 --> 03:21.738
Ahh!

03:34.616 --> 03:36.785
I gotta warn you,

03:36.852 --> 03:38.120
it's got gummy worms,

03:38.186 --> 03:40.388
tater tots,
and ketchup leather.

03:40.455 --> 03:41.655
Hmm.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.624
I know. No liverwurst.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.726
It's not like me
to forget the protein.

03:48.128 --> 03:52.299
Yeah, I get it.
Nobody likes my sandwiches.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.702
Whoa!

04:08.413 --> 04:11.048
Mm. Is that peppercorn?

04:11.115 --> 04:13.584
Sand.

04:13.650 --> 04:15.252
- There you are!
- Ahh!

04:15.319 --> 04:17.821
This mangy stray's
done enough damage for today.

04:17.887 --> 04:19.255
He's coming with me.

04:19.322 --> 04:20.656
He's not a stray.

04:20.723 --> 04:22.191
Is he your dog?

04:22.258 --> 04:25.261
He is, like, totally mine.
If you wanna be.

04:25.328 --> 04:26.996
I'd like that very much.

04:27.062 --> 04:30.098
Okay, then. What's his name?

04:30.165 --> 04:31.367
I don't have one.

04:31.433 --> 04:32.934
His name's...

04:35.604 --> 04:37.037
- Snacks.
- What?

04:37.104 --> 04:38.272
Snacks?

04:38.339 --> 04:41.074
Uh, I mean... Scooby!

04:41.141 --> 04:42.644
Middle name?

04:42.709 --> 04:43.809
Dooby?

04:43.876 --> 04:45.077
Last name.

04:47.180 --> 04:48.281
Doo.

04:48.348 --> 04:51.318
All right.
If the dog has a middle name,

04:51.385 --> 04:53.785
there's no punishment
for damages or theft.

04:53.852 --> 04:56.289
I don't like it,
but them's the laws.

04:56.355 --> 04:59.358
Well, have a good day, sir.
Mr. Dooby-Doo.

05:04.396 --> 05:07.465
I'm Norville,
but everyone calls me Shaggy.

05:07.532 --> 05:08.632
Raggy.

05:08.698 --> 05:10.934
No, it's Shaggy.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.770
That's what I said. Raggy.

05:13.836 --> 05:15.138
We'll work on it.

05:19.442 --> 05:22.177
Shaggy, you and your
new friend better hurry up

05:22.244 --> 05:23.613
if you want to trick-or-treat.

05:23.679 --> 05:25.046
Yay! Okay, Mom.

05:25.947 --> 05:27.649
Let me show you my room.

05:27.715 --> 05:29.784
I mean, our room.

05:40.427 --> 05:41.927
Who's that?

05:41.994 --> 05:46.198
This is Blue Falcon.
He's half-man, half-falcon.

05:46.999 --> 05:49.267
Well, mostly man. All man.

05:49.335 --> 05:51.637
I guess it's just the suit
that's falcon.

05:51.704 --> 05:54.373
And his wonder dog sidekick,
Dynomutt.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.675
Like, they solve crimes
and save the world together.

05:57.741 --> 05:58.610
Cool.

05:58.676 --> 06:00.712
Ooh!

06:00.777 --> 06:02.012
What's this?

06:02.079 --> 06:04.514
- It's a bed. You sleep in it.
- Huh.

06:08.951 --> 06:12.153
Soft. I've never had
a bed before.

06:12.220 --> 06:15.957
In fact, I've never had
anything before.

06:17.426 --> 06:18.661
I, uh...

06:18.728 --> 06:22.263
I ran out this afternoon
and I got something for you.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.365
I know we just met

06:23.431 --> 06:25.300
and I didn't wanna
seem too desperate

06:25.367 --> 06:28.968
or, you know,
come on too strong, but...

06:35.376 --> 06:36.342
I love it.

06:40.112 --> 06:43.283
I promise
I'll never take it off.

06:49.554 --> 06:51.689
Thanks.

06:51.756 --> 06:53.391
Thank you!

06:53.457 --> 06:55.693
Trick or treat!

06:55.760 --> 06:58.128
I love Halloween!

06:58.194 --> 07:00.630
And may I say,

07:00.697 --> 07:02.831
you sure look good
in that costume.

07:02.898 --> 07:05.769
Ranks, Raggy.
It's all in the hips.

07:05.834 --> 07:07.935
Whoa! Jackpot!

07:08.002 --> 07:11.205
Big house, big candy.

07:11.273 --> 07:13.742
Like, no way, bro.
That's the Rigby house.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.976
It's haunted.
Let's get outta here!

07:16.043 --> 07:17.779
Mine!

07:17.844 --> 07:18.945
Hey!

07:19.012 --> 07:20.315
Give it back!

07:20.381 --> 07:22.550
Yeah! We worked hard
for that free candy.

07:22.617 --> 07:24.318
This stuff will rot your teeth.

07:24.384 --> 07:26.919
Yeah. Don't you know Halloween
is just a marketing ploy

07:26.986 --> 07:28.689
by Big Corn Syrup?

07:28.755 --> 07:30.557
Yeah, we're okay with that.

07:32.924 --> 07:34.427
Ruh-roh.

07:36.495 --> 07:39.030
Your blood sugar
will thank us.

07:44.034 --> 07:45.303
Are you guys all right?

07:47.538 --> 07:48.871
Yeah.

07:48.938 --> 07:52.041
They just hurt my pride.
And my tail feathers.

07:52.108 --> 07:53.377
Let me give you a hand.

07:57.245 --> 07:58.013
I'm Fred.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.147
- This is Velma.
- Hi.

07:59.214 --> 08:00.916
- And that's Daphne.
- Hey.

08:00.982 --> 08:03.453
I'm Shaggy.
And this is Scooby-Doo.

08:03.518 --> 08:05.219
Nice to meet you.

08:07.622 --> 08:09.223
Cool Wonder Woman costume.

08:09.291 --> 08:12.727
And are you... Harry Potter?

08:12.793 --> 08:15.962
I'm Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
obviously.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.699
Which house is she in?
Hufflepuff?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.866
She's a Supreme Court justice.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.901
Oh. Slytherin.

08:22.968 --> 08:24.571
Come on.
Let's go get your candy back.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.539
Wait,
that's the Rigby house.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.307
It's haunted by a ghost.

08:28.374 --> 08:29.874
Ghost?

08:29.941 --> 08:32.043
Ghost or no ghost,
it's Halloween.

08:32.110 --> 08:33.878
No one should go home
without their candy.

08:33.945 --> 08:35.513
Uh... Okay.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.548
We'll go in the haunted house
this one time,

08:37.615 --> 08:39.650
but we're not gonna make
a habit out of this.

08:39.717 --> 08:40.751
Right, Scoob?

08:40.818 --> 08:42.052
Right.

08:54.330 --> 08:55.196
Hello?

08:55.997 --> 08:57.932
Anybody home?

08:57.999 --> 09:00.968
This living room feels more
like a dying room.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.007
Here you go, Shaggy.

09:07.074 --> 09:09.343
Great.
Thanks a bunch. Let's go.

09:13.246 --> 09:14.914
It's the ghost!

09:14.981 --> 09:17.683
Guys, there's no such thing
as ghosts.

09:24.623 --> 09:26.591
Hmm.

09:26.658 --> 09:28.660
Uh...

09:28.727 --> 09:30.429
Girl dressed like Judge Judy,

09:30.495 --> 09:32.730
I don't think
this is a good idea.

09:39.202 --> 09:41.036
Huh?

09:50.746 --> 09:52.448
- The ghost!
- Go get help!

09:53.816 --> 09:55.284
Aah!

10:03.824 --> 10:04.925
Come on, hurry!

10:04.990 --> 10:06.959
Guys, we gotta do something.

10:10.630 --> 10:12.197
- Quick, upstairs!
- Come on, let's go!

10:12.264 --> 10:14.934
Daphne!

10:14.999 --> 10:16.335
Whoa!

10:16.402 --> 10:17.736
Run, Daphne, run!

10:28.745 --> 10:29.713
Fred, look!

10:35.651 --> 10:37.587
Uh-oh.

10:37.653 --> 10:39.087
Velma!

10:39.154 --> 10:40.590
Got it.

10:41.990 --> 10:43.792
Hey! What are you... Oh.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.362
Oh.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.330
Huh?

10:48.396 --> 10:50.231
Gotcha.

10:50.298 --> 10:52.065
Jeepers.

10:52.131 --> 10:54.835
It's a Halloween mask.

10:54.902 --> 10:56.470
Mr. Rigby!

10:58.472 --> 11:00.306
Uh, guys?

11:00.373 --> 11:03.276
I think we just found
the world's smallest Walmart.

11:06.144 --> 11:09.180
Man, this guy
stole a lot of stuff!

11:09.248 --> 11:10.415
Bag it all up, Frank.

11:10.482 --> 11:12.751
He's going away
for a long time.

11:17.989 --> 11:20.291
I would've
gotten away with this

11:20.358 --> 11:22.727
if it weren't for you
meddling...

11:24.761 --> 11:26.195
Congratulations, everyone.

11:26.263 --> 11:28.230
We just proved
this house wasn't haunted,

11:28.298 --> 11:29.566
and busted a perp.

11:29.633 --> 11:32.233
And even better,
we got our candy back.

11:32.301 --> 11:34.135
Not bad for a bunch of kids.

11:34.202 --> 11:35.971
Maybe we should do this again.

11:36.037 --> 11:37.940
- I like it.
- I'm in.

11:38.007 --> 11:39.207
What do you say, guys?

11:40.742 --> 11:42.243
We're in.

11:42.310 --> 11:45.747
I mean, like, how many
scary monsters could there be?

All right, everybody.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.765
I would like to pose to you all

12:45.832 --> 12:47.500
the question of questions.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.236
What's next for Mystery Inc.?

12:50.303 --> 12:53.472
Ooh, I totally have
the answer. Lunch.

12:53.539 --> 12:55.874
No, Shaggy, I think
what Fred means is that...

12:55.941 --> 12:57.610
I was also gonna say lunch.

12:57.676 --> 12:58.777
Guys, guys, guys.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.980
The Mystery Machine
needs a whole new...

13:02.046 --> 13:03.348
Needs a whole new everything,

13:03.414 --> 13:05.350
and I'm never gonna
get that smell out.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.618
I told you I needed a walk.

13:07.684 --> 13:10.654
It's time to turn Mystery Inc.
into a real business.

13:10.721 --> 13:13.122
What do you mean?
Like, carry a briefcase,

13:13.189 --> 13:16.191
and wear a tie, and pay taxes?

13:16.258 --> 13:17.860
Wait, have you not been
paying your taxes?

13:17.927 --> 13:19.528
I handle our accounting.

13:19.595 --> 13:21.731
Look, we're ready
to take on bigger cases,

13:21.797 --> 13:24.099
scarier villains,
and creepier mysteries,

13:24.164 --> 13:25.233
but that takes money.

13:25.300 --> 13:26.768
Fortunately,

13:26.835 --> 13:28.135
we found a possible investor.

13:28.202 --> 13:30.372
Oh, whoopee, a diner.

13:30.438 --> 13:33.340
I'll have a napkin
and some hand sanitizer.

13:33.407 --> 13:37.077
Whoa, man! It's Simon Cowell.

13:39.046 --> 13:44.117
<i>♪ In the shallow ♪</i>

13:44.182 --> 13:48.587
<i>♪ In the shallow ♪</i>

13:48.654 --> 13:52.924
<i>♪ I'm off the deep end
Watch as I dive in ♪</i>

13:52.991 --> 13:56.227
Uh, congratulations, gentlemen.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.396
You are terrible.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.231
How does he do that?
See, he's mean,

14:00.297 --> 14:01.866
but he makes it fun.

14:01.932 --> 14:04.434
We appreciate your interest
in Mystery Inc., Mr. Cowell.

14:04.501 --> 14:05.769
Every successful group

14:05.835 --> 14:08.738
requires hard work
and determination.

14:08.805 --> 14:13.174
Identifying potential is what
I do, and you have got it.

14:13.242 --> 14:15.411
Fred, you're the tank.
The muscle.

14:15.477 --> 14:16.645
- Cool.
- Daphne is

14:16.712 --> 14:18.547
the people person. The empath.

14:18.614 --> 14:21.015
- Aw.
- And Velma's got the smarts

14:21.082 --> 14:23.251
- and technical savvy.
- Thanks.

14:23.317 --> 14:24.852
But you two
aren't even listening.

14:24.919 --> 14:28.488
You're eating a clownishly
oversized sandwich.

14:29.156 --> 14:30.557
Like, sorry, man.

14:30.624 --> 14:32.726
You lost us at,
"Hard work and determination."

14:32.793 --> 14:34.928
But you got us back
at "sandwich."

14:34.995 --> 14:38.631
Look, a group can only be as
strong as its weakest links.

14:38.698 --> 14:41.567
Bottom line, I can't invest
with these two involved.

14:41.634 --> 14:45.036
But, Mr. Cowell, Shaggy and
Scooby are our best friends.

14:45.103 --> 14:48.273
Yeah, and like, what's more
valuable than friendship?

14:48.339 --> 14:50.308
Literally, anything.

14:50.375 --> 14:53.577
You can't count on friendship.
People change.

14:53.644 --> 14:55.312
And when you get
into real trouble,

14:55.379 --> 14:57.948
friendship won't save the day.

14:58.015 --> 15:01.250
Like, we don't need this,
Scoob. Let's bounce.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.886
Yeah, we know
when we're not wanted.

15:03.953 --> 15:05.054
No.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.389
- Ugh. Wait.
- Come on, guys.

15:06.456 --> 15:07.856
He didn't mean it.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.961
No fries for you. Hmm!

15:26.106 --> 15:28.074
You believe
the nerve of that dude?

15:28.141 --> 15:31.543
Simon Cowell thinks friendship
won't save the day.

15:31.610 --> 15:33.612
What does he know?

15:38.050 --> 15:40.551
Yeah, he's not that smart.
Just sounds like it,

15:40.618 --> 15:42.820
because he's British.

15:42.887 --> 15:44.322
Good point, Raggy.

15:44.388 --> 15:47.624
As long as we have each other,
we'll be just fine on our own.

15:48.291 --> 15:49.359
Right.

15:56.365 --> 15:57.566
Yes!

16:03.037 --> 16:03.938
Eyes?

16:04.005 --> 16:05.573
Raggy, look.

16:05.640 --> 16:09.377
- Huh?
- The pin. It has eyes.

16:16.583 --> 16:18.085
Oh, Scoob,

16:18.152 --> 16:21.053
I know it feels like
everyone's judging us today.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.555
Even the bowling pins.

16:22.622 --> 16:24.457
But don't freak out on me, bud.

16:26.125 --> 16:28.126
Uh...

16:28.193 --> 16:29.494
What's the hold-up?

16:29.561 --> 16:31.863
The ball return
won't return our ball.

16:39.870 --> 16:40.738
Huh.

16:49.213 --> 16:50.947
Oh, there it is.

16:52.314 --> 16:53.949
Zoinks!

16:54.016 --> 16:56.084
Like, what is going on?

16:58.353 --> 16:59.854
What are those things?

16:59.921 --> 17:01.889
I don't know,
but they don't look friendly.

17:05.227 --> 17:06.460
No offense, but I think

17:06.527 --> 17:08.694
I liked you better
as a bowling ball.

17:08.762 --> 17:09.863
Me, too.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.099
Look out!

17:15.268 --> 17:16.335
Whoa!

17:21.241 --> 17:22.540
No running.

17:23.974 --> 17:25.643
They're coming.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.483
- What now?
- Follow my lead.

17:34.252 --> 17:35.619
Who's hungry?

17:35.686 --> 17:37.521
Check out the specials.

17:38.822 --> 17:41.157
So, like, what are you guys
in the mood to eat?

17:41.225 --> 17:42.925
And please don't say human.

17:42.992 --> 17:43.960
Or dog.

17:48.463 --> 17:50.799
Okay, Bowling Alley Yakitori.

17:50.866 --> 17:53.401
And how about you guys?
Hot wings to share?

17:53.468 --> 17:54.369
Uh-huh.

17:54.436 --> 17:56.837
Got it. And for you?

17:58.505 --> 18:01.141
Oh, no! We're out of calamari.

18:06.579 --> 18:08.249
This way, Scoob!

18:16.889 --> 18:19.423
Huh, I always wondered
what was back here.

18:19.490 --> 18:20.658
Underwhelming.

18:25.997 --> 18:28.164
<i>All units.</i>

18:28.232 --> 18:30.166
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

18:30.234 --> 18:33.670
<i>We have a 4-1-5 in progress
at the Takamoto Bowl.</i>

18:33.737 --> 18:36.005
"Tiny violent
shape-shifting robots

18:36.071 --> 18:37.506
chasing a man and a dog

18:37.573 --> 18:40.142
in a bowling alley,
linen store or car wash."

18:40.210 --> 18:42.444
Wow, the police really do have
a code for everything.

18:42.511 --> 18:43.811
The Takamoto Bowl?

18:43.878 --> 18:45.413
That's where
Scoob and Shaggy hang out.

18:45.480 --> 18:47.249
Oh, no.

18:47.316 --> 18:48.516
Let's go.

18:55.223 --> 18:56.456
Did we lose 'em?

18:56.523 --> 18:58.125
Pretty sure we didn't.

19:16.607 --> 19:17.574
Yikes!

19:23.746 --> 19:26.683
Looks like this is goodbye,
old buddy.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.551
We never saw Paris.

19:31.053 --> 19:31.920
Huh?

19:57.743 --> 20:01.513
Oh, man,
dig that crazy elevator.

20:01.580 --> 20:02.981
You okay, Scooby-Doo?

20:03.047 --> 20:05.116
Yeah. I'm good.

20:06.385 --> 20:08.920
Whew. Where are we?

20:18.028 --> 20:20.364
Dude, hang on.

20:20.430 --> 20:22.299
Do you realize where we are?

20:22.366 --> 20:24.166
- No.
- Look around, man.

20:24.234 --> 20:25.768
The clean, modern aesthetic.

20:25.835 --> 20:27.769
The cool blue color palette.

20:27.836 --> 20:28.803
- We're in...
- IKEA!

20:28.870 --> 20:30.505
...the <i>Falcon Fury!</i>

20:30.572 --> 20:31.840
Did you say IKEA?

20:31.906 --> 20:34.576
Nope. I said <i>Falcon Fury.</i>
Just like you.

20:36.510 --> 20:38.179
Gentlemen, welcome aboard.

20:38.246 --> 20:41.815
I'm Dee Dee Skyes,
pilot of the <i>Falcon Fury.</i>

20:41.882 --> 20:43.417
- Well, we're Scoob...
- Scooby and Shaggy.

20:43.484 --> 20:44.884
We know. Follow me.

20:44.951 --> 20:46.886
Who sent those robots?

20:46.953 --> 20:48.821
It's this guy named
Dick Dastardly.

20:48.888 --> 20:50.956
Shocker!
He's a psychotic supervillain.

20:51.023 --> 20:53.091
He's trying to
you.

20:53.158 --> 20:56.862
Scoob, somebody thinks we're
important enough to...

20:56.928 --> 20:59.130
It's nice to be wanted.

20:59.197 --> 21:00.598
Mm, I hear that.

21:05.404 --> 21:07.371
Oh, wow!

21:07.438 --> 21:08.872
- Look! Look!
- Wow.

21:08.938 --> 21:11.141
Yes, I know
it's super cool in here,

21:11.208 --> 21:13.310
and I would totally let you
guys press random buttons,

21:13.377 --> 21:14.743
but they told me
we need to move.

21:16.045 --> 21:18.448
Seriously?
We're doing this now?

21:18.515 --> 21:20.115
Ooh. Is it him? Is it him?

21:20.183 --> 21:22.984
Yep. He likes to make
an entrance.

21:23.051 --> 21:25.153
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

21:25.220 --> 21:26.988
<i>since the dawn of time...</i>

21:27.055 --> 21:28.756
<i>...the falcon
has been worshipped</i>

21:28.823 --> 21:31.725
<i>as a symbol
of freedom and victory.</i>

21:32.193 --> 21:33.261
<i>Now,</i>

21:33.327 --> 21:36.497
<i>a new kind of falcon
rules the sky.</i>

21:36.563 --> 21:41.535
<i>And he is one bad mamma jamma.</i>

21:41.600 --> 21:42.868
Blue Falcon!

21:46.938 --> 21:48.307
Ooh, yeah!

21:57.248 --> 22:00.185
Welcome to the <i>Falcon Fury.</i>

22:03.086 --> 22:04.421
Hang on, hang on.

22:04.488 --> 22:05.855
Turn on the lights.

22:05.922 --> 22:06.923
Where are my balloons, Dee Dee?

22:06.989 --> 22:08.258
When I say <i>"Falcon Fury,"</i>

22:08.325 --> 22:10.093
that's supposed
to cue the balloons.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.060
Keith, what is the deal
up there, man?

22:12.127 --> 22:13.595
<i>I missed the cue.</i>

22:13.662 --> 22:16.466
Duh. You've got one job, pal.
Anyway,

22:16.532 --> 22:18.600
welcome aboard,
I'm Blue Falcon.

22:19.667 --> 22:20.634
No, you're not.

22:20.701 --> 22:22.270
Yes, I am.

22:22.337 --> 22:24.071
I told you I wasn't going to
be the only one who noticed.

22:24.138 --> 22:26.739
No, Blue Falcon's suit
has a bigger red "F"

22:26.806 --> 22:29.376
on the chest,
and it's way less, uh, scaly.

22:29.443 --> 22:31.945
They're feathers, all right?
And it's called an upgrade.

22:32.011 --> 22:33.780
This ain't
your daddy's Blue Falcon.

22:33.847 --> 22:36.849
I think you mean this ain't
your daddy's Blue Falcon.

22:36.915 --> 22:38.684
Allow me to introduce you

22:38.750 --> 22:43.255
to Blue Falcon's
large adult son, Brian.

22:43.322 --> 22:44.456
Dynomutt!

22:44.523 --> 22:45.890
Oh, him you recognize?

22:45.957 --> 22:48.960
Well, sure, man!
Dynomutt is the dog wonder.

22:49.026 --> 22:51.761
Blue Falcon doesn't go
anywhere without him.

22:51.828 --> 22:55.299
And yet here I am. Without him.

22:55.366 --> 22:56.666
Ow! What was that for?

22:56.733 --> 22:58.236
Making sure this isn't a dream.

22:58.302 --> 23:00.337
You're supposed
to pinch yourself.

23:01.271 --> 23:02.572
- Ow!
- Ow!

23:02.638 --> 23:04.274
- Oh!
- Ow!

23:04.341 --> 23:05.674
Ow.

23:06.741 --> 23:08.210
Finished?

23:08.277 --> 23:09.178
- Ow!
- Yes.

23:09.245 --> 23:11.247
- Wait, Brian...
- Blue Falcon.

23:11.313 --> 23:13.915
- If you're Blue Falcon now...
- I am.

23:13.982 --> 23:15.517
- Does that mean...
- Yes.

23:15.583 --> 23:19.187
Regretfully, my father has
moved on to a better place.

23:20.221 --> 23:21.822
Oh, no!

23:21.889 --> 23:25.459
What? Oh, no, he's not dead.
He retired to Palm Beach.

23:25.526 --> 23:28.761
We still miss him
very, very, very,

23:28.828 --> 23:30.862
- very, very...
- Oh, no, he's glitching.

23:30.929 --> 23:31.897
No, I'm not. Let me finish.

23:31.963 --> 23:35.368
...very, very, very much.

23:36.902 --> 23:38.437
It's Dastardly.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.037
He must have tracked you here
from the bowling alley.

23:40.104 --> 23:41.939
Let's move it, people.
To the Falcon Nest.

23:42.006 --> 23:43.774
Like, hey, wait up!

23:49.979 --> 23:53.617
Nobody gets away
from Dick Dastardly.

23:53.683 --> 23:54.850
Right, Rottens?

23:56.619 --> 23:59.688
I need what's on that ship,
or I'll never get my treasure.

23:59.755 --> 24:02.591
Do not fail me.

24:08.796 --> 24:10.499
Dee Dee, take the helm.

24:10.565 --> 24:12.132
Ready, sir.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.268
You might want to buckle up.

24:14.335 --> 24:16.537
And if you get sick,
puke on Brian.

24:16.604 --> 24:17.804
Punch it, Dee Dee.

24:19.138 --> 24:20.207
Hang on.

24:22.741 --> 24:24.777
- Zoinks!
- What's this guy's deal?

24:24.843 --> 24:26.513
Look, the hot goss
on my fan site

24:26.579 --> 24:27.745
is that Dastardly's collecting

24:27.812 --> 24:29.215
the three shells
of Seabiscuit...

24:29.281 --> 24:32.618
It's skulls of Cerberus,
Brian. We went over this.

24:32.685 --> 24:34.286
He's got one skull.

24:34.353 --> 24:36.119
Our mission is to make sure
he doesn't get the other two.

24:36.187 --> 24:38.989
Like, what do those creepy
skulls have to do with us?

24:39.056 --> 24:40.291
No idea.

24:43.260 --> 24:44.428
Hold tight.

24:55.103 --> 24:56.938
- I can't shake him.
- Try the shake button.

24:57.005 --> 24:58.673
Ooh, I'll take
a chocolate shake.

24:58.739 --> 25:00.242
Vanilla, please.

25:00.308 --> 25:02.410
- There is no shake button.
- Well, there should be.

25:04.246 --> 25:06.779
All right, Rottens.
Launch the harpoons.

25:10.684 --> 25:12.785
Incoming!

25:13.520 --> 25:14.953
What is going on?

25:20.627 --> 25:24.596
Well done. Reel them in.

25:24.663 --> 25:27.232
Dynomutt, can you reverse the
polarity of the tractor beam?

25:27.299 --> 25:28.600
Of course,
but that would make...

25:28.667 --> 25:30.269
- Reverse on my mark.
- On it.

25:32.470 --> 25:33.770
Now!

25:35.339 --> 25:37.241
Why have we stopped pulling
in that ship?

25:39.709 --> 25:41.278
Oh, no, no, no. No, no. No!

25:52.987 --> 25:54.489
Argh! Drat!

25:59.826 --> 26:01.362
Whew. Are you guys okay?

26:02.862 --> 26:04.797
Yeah, but, like, if you want,

26:04.864 --> 26:07.434
you can pull over
and drop us off here.

26:07.501 --> 26:11.404
We'll walk home.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.938
Dastardly could have
finished us if he wanted to.

26:14.005 --> 26:15.874
I think he wants
you guys alive.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.576
I knew you two were important.

26:17.643 --> 26:20.412
It would be safer for you if
you joined us on our mission.

26:20.478 --> 26:21.812
It would?

26:21.879 --> 26:25.417
Ring, ring! Ring, ring!
Ring, ring!

26:25.483 --> 26:26.417
Ring, ring!

26:26.483 --> 26:28.419
Boop! Hello? Oh!

26:28.485 --> 26:29.753
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

26:29.819 --> 26:31.221
Well, of course.

26:31.288 --> 26:33.823
Uh, guys, adventure's calling,
and it's for you.

26:36.392 --> 26:37.627
Hello, adventure.

26:37.694 --> 26:40.263
Yes, will you take my name
and number off your list?

26:41.631 --> 26:44.031
But, Raggy, this is our chance.

26:44.098 --> 26:45.400
Yeah, maybe you're right.

26:45.467 --> 26:47.968
We can show everyone
we're not the weak link.

26:48.035 --> 26:50.970
Uh, Mr. Adventure, sir,
it's me again.

26:51.037 --> 26:53.174
Uh, my partner is intrigued
by your offer,

26:53.240 --> 26:54.508
but I'm still on the fence.

26:54.575 --> 26:56.477
We're gonna have
to call you back. Bye-bye.

26:59.512 --> 27:00.447
Click.

27:00.513 --> 27:02.349
- You really wanna do this?
- Uh-huh.

27:02.415 --> 27:04.451
Well, I'm not gonna
let you do it without me.

27:04.517 --> 27:07.952
After all, there is no "I"
in Scooby and Shaggy.

27:08.019 --> 27:09.555
Wait, is there?

27:09.621 --> 27:10.955
No, all good.

27:11.022 --> 27:12.056
We're in.

27:12.124 --> 27:13.592
That's what I'm talking about!

27:13.659 --> 27:15.760
Now, I've got a few waivers
for you guys to sign.

27:17.762 --> 27:20.365
Oh, great. Great timing, Keith.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.166
<i>Thank you!</i>

27:22.233 --> 27:24.201
Well, uh,
the robots attacked

27:24.267 --> 27:26.136
this talking dog
and a gangly dude

27:26.203 --> 27:28.839
that had this habit
of using the word "like"

27:28.904 --> 27:30.140
at the start of every sentence.

27:30.207 --> 27:31.807
Almost as if he was

27:31.873 --> 27:35.211
some middle-aged man's idea
of how a teenage hippie talks.

27:35.277 --> 27:37.446
Oh, that's Scoob and Shaggy
all right.

27:37.513 --> 27:38.713
So, what happened?

27:38.780 --> 27:40.782
I don't know.
They seemed pretty bummed out.

27:40.849 --> 27:42.082
I guess their friends
dumped them

27:42.150 --> 27:43.951
in a cold-hearted way
or something.

27:44.017 --> 27:46.086
And then this blue light
came down from the sky

27:46.154 --> 27:47.521
and beamed them up.

27:47.588 --> 27:51.225
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Shaggy and Scooby were taken?

27:51.291 --> 27:52.593
Yeah.

27:52.659 --> 27:54.093
I'd have to assume that if
they were with their friends,

27:54.161 --> 27:55.762
they wouldn't
have been kidnapped.,

27:55.828 --> 27:57.663
I can't...

27:57.730 --> 27:59.165
I can't breathe.

27:59.232 --> 28:01.234
Whoever those friends are

28:01.300 --> 28:03.402
must be carrying a ton of guilt

28:03.468 --> 28:05.437
on their shoulders
right about now.

28:05.504 --> 28:07.239
Okay, can you skip
the emotional punishment

28:07.305 --> 28:08.807
and describe the robots,
please?

28:08.874 --> 28:11.642
Yeah, sure. Uh, they looked
like what's in this box.

28:11.709 --> 28:12.909
Whoa!

28:14.345 --> 28:16.580
Guys,
this thing is <i>increíble.</i>

28:16.647 --> 28:18.882
It's fully autonomous
and capable of modifying

28:18.947 --> 28:20.683
its external appearance.

28:20.750 --> 28:23.353
I'd like to shake the hand
of whoever created this.

28:26.655 --> 28:29.191
And then, you know,
throw that hand in prison

28:29.258 --> 28:30.992
for trying to kill our friends.

28:31.058 --> 28:32.761
Right? Am I right?

28:32.828 --> 28:35.061
Ew! Is that... a hair?

28:39.700 --> 28:41.935
Maybe this can lead us
to our culprit.

28:42.002 --> 28:43.236
What are you doing?

28:43.303 --> 28:44.970
You're touching it
with bare fingers.

28:45.037 --> 28:46.206
Grow up, Fred.

28:46.273 --> 28:47.774
Do you know
how many stray hairs

28:47.841 --> 28:49.576
the average human eats
every day without knowing it?

28:49.643 --> 28:51.075
If it's more than zero,
I don't wanna know.

28:51.143 --> 28:53.945
It's more. Much, much more.

28:54.012 --> 28:56.782
Huh. Trace amounts
of mustache oil.

28:56.849 --> 28:58.150
12-year-old Scotch.

28:58.217 --> 29:00.785
Ugh. Is the bad guy my dad?

29:00.852 --> 29:03.521
There are also some
microscopic soil particles.

29:03.588 --> 29:07.157
Composition is a mix
of arsenic, selenium and...

29:07.224 --> 29:08.926
Coppertone SPF 50.

29:08.991 --> 29:10.727
Anything over 30 is a waste.

29:10.794 --> 29:12.496
I'll see if the combination
of these elements

29:12.563 --> 29:14.564
matches
a geographical location.

29:15.398 --> 29:17.032
And...

29:17.098 --> 29:20.169
Bingo. Dastardly Demolition.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.237
Per county records,

29:22.304 --> 29:24.972
last known owner is...
Dick Dastardly.

29:25.039 --> 29:28.109
What would a creep like that
want with Scooby and Shaggy?

29:28.176 --> 29:29.511
Hmm. Well, let's see what

29:29.578 --> 29:31.812
the police department database
has to say.

29:31.879 --> 29:33.481
Ooh. Quite a rap sheet.

29:33.547 --> 29:35.182
It looks like
he's wanted for the theft

29:35.249 --> 29:38.351
of archeological artifacts
from a dig in Peru.

29:39.285 --> 29:41.187
<i>Tatty bye.</i>

29:41.254 --> 29:43.456
That looks like
a giant dog skull.

29:43.523 --> 29:44.324
Weird.

29:44.390 --> 29:46.558
It gets weirder. He also stole

29:46.625 --> 29:47.793
the genealogical records

29:47.860 --> 29:50.128
of a dozen dogs
from the Global Kennel Club.

29:50.195 --> 29:51.897
And apparently
he's been stealing Netflix

29:51.964 --> 29:53.198
by using his mother's account.

29:53.265 --> 29:54.866
That is not fair

29:54.932 --> 29:57.168
for the rest of us
who have to pay for Netflix.

29:57.235 --> 29:58.936
You have to pay for Netflix?

29:59.002 --> 30:00.471
This will not stand.

30:00.538 --> 30:03.206
Let's go get
that Dastardly dude.

30:20.488 --> 30:24.726
I just needed you
to retrieve one simple canine,

30:24.792 --> 30:27.494
so I could get my treasure.

30:27.561 --> 30:30.864
Now, were the missions
a failure?

30:32.432 --> 30:36.102
Pinhead.
The question was rhetorical.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.370
Of course it was a failure

30:37.436 --> 30:40.071
because you failed me.

30:40.139 --> 30:43.008
You are responsible
for my suffering.

30:47.279 --> 30:51.715
Oh, sorry. You're sorry?
You certainly are.

30:51.782 --> 30:54.218
And I thought my last sidekick
was worthless.

30:54.285 --> 30:56.320
At least he had a backbone.

30:57.988 --> 31:01.591
And fur and a wet nose.

31:01.658 --> 31:04.327
But you, whoa-ho-ho,
you've lowered the bar

31:04.394 --> 31:06.228
to new depths
of craven ineptitude

31:06.295 --> 31:07.996
I didn't even think
were possible.

31:09.464 --> 31:12.768
That's not a compliment,
you aluminum imbecile!

31:12.834 --> 31:14.268
You're not a partner,

31:14.335 --> 31:16.237
you're a disgrace, a lemming,

31:16.304 --> 31:18.172
a boot-licking...

31:19.707 --> 31:21.375
...suck-up.

31:21.442 --> 31:24.644
An example must be made.

31:25.845 --> 31:27.614
I want you to know
this is going to hurt me

31:27.681 --> 31:29.816
a lot more than
it's going to hurt you.

31:29.883 --> 31:33.252
No, not really.

31:36.221 --> 31:37.690
Let this be a lesson
to you all.

31:37.756 --> 31:40.692
If you're going to be
a sniveling suck-face...

31:41.759 --> 31:43.394
...you're going
to look the part.

31:45.597 --> 31:50.200
Forget you mechanical morons.
I'll fetch the key myself.

31:59.809 --> 32:01.410
To find the second skull,
I'm searching

32:01.477 --> 32:03.912
every possible location
with high fossil density.

32:03.979 --> 32:06.081
Brian! Quit putting filters
on your selfies

32:06.147 --> 32:07.449
and get in the game.

32:07.515 --> 32:09.085
Whoa, whoa,
what do you think I'm doing?

32:09.150 --> 32:11.819
I'm putting my social media
feelers out there, Dynobutt.

32:11.885 --> 32:13.354
Found it!

32:13.420 --> 32:14.355
The second skull?

32:14.421 --> 32:15.889
No. Even better.

32:15.956 --> 32:17.524
The Falcon Fridge.

32:17.591 --> 32:21.227
FYI, you are
officially out of...

32:21.294 --> 32:23.329
everything.

32:23.396 --> 32:24.998
Yes! I love these guys.

32:25.064 --> 32:27.332
I'm busting my tail
to save the world for him,

32:27.399 --> 32:30.369
and he loves the guys
who brought treats.

32:30.435 --> 32:33.805
Prepare your taste buds
for a Scoob-Shag specialty.

32:38.609 --> 32:41.646
Whoa, whoa. You put jalapeño
peppers on your ice cream?

32:41.712 --> 32:42.512
Heat and sweet.

32:42.579 --> 32:44.381
It's our signature dessert.

32:44.447 --> 32:45.615
Heat signature!

32:45.682 --> 32:48.018
That's it!
You guys are geniuses!

32:48.085 --> 32:50.120
We're geniuses.

32:50.185 --> 32:52.588
Take that, Simon Cowell.

32:52.655 --> 32:54.223
The supernatural energy
in that skull

32:54.289 --> 32:56.425
would give off
a specific heat signature.

32:56.492 --> 32:58.826
All we gotta do
is locate that spot.

33:00.328 --> 33:02.296
Boom! The skull
is in the Gobi Desert.

33:02.363 --> 33:03.631
Incorrect.

33:03.698 --> 33:05.233
I just found out
where the skull is,

33:05.299 --> 33:06.967
and it's not
in the Gobi Desert.

33:07.034 --> 33:08.301
It's in Romania.

33:08.368 --> 33:09.803
Like, how do you know?

33:09.870 --> 33:11.805
A hero never reveals
his secrets.

33:11.872 --> 33:13.774
I believe you're thinking
of magicians.

33:13.840 --> 33:15.474
I'm always thinking
of magicians.

33:15.541 --> 33:17.043
But if you must know,

33:17.110 --> 33:19.578
I got a DM from one of my fans
who gave me the locayshe.

33:19.645 --> 33:21.313
Brian, those are a lot of words

33:21.380 --> 33:23.115
no one your age
should be using.

33:23.181 --> 33:25.684
Sir, this could be a trap
set by Dastardly.

33:25.750 --> 33:29.054
If it was a trap, why would
Anonymous use his own name?

33:29.121 --> 33:34.558
Wait, do you think "Anonymous"
is the name of a person?

33:34.625 --> 33:36.894
Well, based on your tone
of voice, I don't any more.

33:36.960 --> 33:40.130
Sir, we really should go
to the Gobi Desert.

33:40.196 --> 33:42.298
I hear you.
You make a valid point,

33:42.365 --> 33:44.000
but we're gonna do
my thing, okay?

33:44.067 --> 33:45.702
To the Falcon Nest.

33:45.768 --> 33:47.769
Brian, last time you listened
to someone on the Internet,

33:47.836 --> 33:51.673
you thought Tinder was an app
that delivers firewood.

33:51.740 --> 33:53.275
Velma, what do you got?

33:53.341 --> 33:55.209
I built a sequencing program
to cross-match

33:55.276 --> 33:56.577
the biographical data

33:56.644 --> 33:58.146
that Dastardly stole
from the canine registry

33:58.212 --> 33:59.081
against Scooby-Doo.

33:59.147 --> 34:00.548
Good thing I'm the tank,

34:00.614 --> 34:02.282
because I could
not do any of that.

34:02.348 --> 34:03.683
Any leads?

34:03.750 --> 34:05.785
All the dogs, and Scooby,
seem to be related.

34:05.852 --> 34:07.121
Jeepers.

34:07.188 --> 34:09.987
If I take Dastardly's work
and follow the trail...

34:12.658 --> 34:15.994
Whoa! Scooby-Doo is the last
descendant of Peritas?

34:16.061 --> 34:17.228
Who's Peritas?

34:17.295 --> 34:18.963
He was
Alexander the Great's dog.

34:19.030 --> 34:21.933
Okay, so, Scooby is related
to some ancient dog.

34:21.998 --> 34:23.967
- So, what does that mean?
- I have no idea.

34:24.034 --> 34:26.603
Guys, this is our
most important mystery ever.

34:26.670 --> 34:29.371
Yeah. This isn't about
some guy in a rubber mask.

34:29.438 --> 34:30.774
It's about one of us.

34:30.841 --> 34:32.943
Fred, how much longer
to Dastardly Demolition?

34:33.009 --> 34:34.143
I know a shortcut.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.902
Hustle, you two!
We haven't got all day!

35:04.670 --> 35:06.438
Second thoughts?

35:06.505 --> 35:10.008
Honestly, buddy,
I'm on my 4th or 5th thoughts.

35:21.885 --> 35:22.986
Oh, man.

35:23.052 --> 35:26.723
This amusement park
isn't very amusing!

35:27.924 --> 35:29.392
According to Anonymous,

35:29.459 --> 35:32.327
the second skull
should be right here.

35:38.167 --> 35:41.803
Hey! Did Dastardly get
the anonymous tip, too?

35:41.869 --> 35:46.406
You dim-witted do-gooders!

35:46.473 --> 35:48.642
I've already retrieved
the second skull

35:48.708 --> 35:50.844
from the Gobi Desert.

35:50.911 --> 35:54.413
Gobi Desert? Hmm. Where have I
heard that before?

35:54.480 --> 35:57.483
Oh, right, me.

35:57.550 --> 35:59.085
Okay, Brian,
we've had our differences,

35:59.152 --> 36:01.353
but this is the moment
where we stand together and...

36:01.420 --> 36:02.487
Run!

36:04.022 --> 36:05.390
Classic Brian.

36:06.758 --> 36:09.027
Dee Dee, you cover
Scooby and Shaggy.

36:09.094 --> 36:10.394
I'll run interference.

36:25.898 --> 36:28.501
Stop right there,
you filthy animal.

36:28.568 --> 36:30.036
And your dog, too.

36:30.103 --> 36:31.237
This way!

37:00.429 --> 37:02.097
Aw.

37:04.967 --> 37:08.403
Weak link, my butt.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.911
Whoa, dude!
What do you want with us?

37:17.978 --> 37:21.148
I don't care about you.

37:21.214 --> 37:22.849
You're not remotely important.

37:22.915 --> 37:24.417
It's the dog I need.

37:25.551 --> 37:27.553
Raggy!

37:27.621 --> 37:30.623
Stay! Sit! Heel!
Did nobody train this thing?

37:37.696 --> 37:38.996
Oh, hey.

37:39.062 --> 37:40.364
Look, I know it looks like
I'm hiding,

37:40.431 --> 37:42.667
but this is actually
a superior vantage point!

37:45.302 --> 37:46.002
Whoa!

38:02.684 --> 38:04.518
Scooby-Dooby-Doo?

38:05.419 --> 38:08.222
Where are you?

38:08.289 --> 38:10.691
Come on now. Don't be scared.

38:10.758 --> 38:13.828
I love dogs.

38:13.894 --> 38:17.130
I had a dog myself once.
He was an ill-tempered brute

38:17.197 --> 38:18.631
with a ghastly underbite,

38:18.698 --> 38:21.868
who stunk and caused me
endless headaches.

38:21.935 --> 38:23.001
He's lost now.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.671
Is he chipped?

38:24.737 --> 38:26.037
Forget about him.

38:26.103 --> 38:28.039
It's all about you.

38:28.105 --> 38:31.175
You, my friend, are special.

38:31.242 --> 38:34.478
You see, within you lies a key.

38:34.544 --> 38:37.949
What... I don't have your key.
No pockets.

38:38.014 --> 38:39.951
No. You are the key.

38:41.751 --> 38:43.653
Join me, Scooby-Doo,

38:43.720 --> 38:46.790
and I will show you
how to harness your destiny

38:46.857 --> 38:50.559
and become the most
important dog in the world.

38:50.626 --> 38:52.360
No, thanks, Dastardly.

38:52.427 --> 38:55.230
Oh, please.
My friends call me...

38:56.097 --> 38:56.998
Dick.

38:57.065 --> 38:59.199
Rokay, Rick.

38:59.266 --> 39:02.770
No, I'm not a Rick.
I'm a Dick. With a D.

39:02.837 --> 39:04.238
Rick. With a D.

39:04.304 --> 39:06.773
D-D-D-Dick!

39:06.840 --> 39:08.976
R-R-R-Rick.

39:09.041 --> 39:10.376
Dick, Dick,

39:10.443 --> 39:11.778
Dick!

39:15.748 --> 39:16.716
Drat.

39:19.217 --> 39:21.086
Brian! Do something!

39:22.621 --> 39:25.089
- Like what?
- Like drop some F-bombs.

39:25.155 --> 39:27.124
Hey, man, whoa,
let's keep it PG.

39:27.191 --> 39:30.260
No. Falcon bombs!

39:30.326 --> 39:32.328
You know, my utility belt
has so many little pouches.

39:32.395 --> 39:34.698
- They're right there!
- Ah!

39:34.765 --> 39:36.299
12 trillion volts, brother.

39:36.366 --> 39:38.635
- You wanna throw it?
- Do I ever!

39:40.570 --> 39:43.205
F-bombs away!

40:06.793 --> 40:09.828
Here, boy! Where are you?

40:15.233 --> 40:17.769
You're mine, Scooby-Doo!

40:17.835 --> 40:19.637
Sit.

40:19.704 --> 40:20.437
Good boy.

40:20.504 --> 40:23.273
You can start screaming...

40:23.340 --> 40:25.475
now.

40:27.044 --> 40:28.177
Follow that dog.

40:36.619 --> 40:37.853
- Brian!
- Raggy!

40:39.989 --> 40:42.122
Whoo-hoo!

40:47.394 --> 40:48.563
I hate the loops.

40:51.130 --> 40:52.398
Give me that dog!

40:52.465 --> 40:54.200
- Raggy!
- Scooby!

40:54.267 --> 40:56.302
Everybody say,
"Hashtag foxy Falcon."

40:56.369 --> 40:58.037
Hashtag foxy Falcon!

41:04.043 --> 41:07.879
Drat!

41:12.350 --> 41:13.951
Not again.

41:15.820 --> 41:17.088
Dastardly will be back.

41:17.153 --> 41:18.990
Please tell me
you got some leads.

41:20.156 --> 41:22.157
Dastardly said I was the key.

41:22.224 --> 41:24.393
- The key to what?
- Ah-ha!

41:24.460 --> 41:26.195
- I knew this guy was special!
- Why?

41:26.261 --> 41:27.831
Because the bad guy said so?

41:27.897 --> 41:30.465
Exactly! What did Dastardly
say about you?

41:30.531 --> 41:33.434
Well, I believe
his exact words were, uh,

41:33.501 --> 41:34.870
"I don't care about you.

41:34.937 --> 41:36.437
You're not remotely important."

41:36.504 --> 41:38.505
And, "It's the dog I need."

41:38.573 --> 41:39.574
Harsh.

41:39.641 --> 41:40.842
And then he shot me
through the wall.

41:40.908 --> 41:42.076
Really harsh.

41:42.142 --> 41:43.377
But, on the bright side,

41:43.443 --> 41:45.712
your friend is super important.

41:45.779 --> 41:47.581
Now let's get
that dog a hero suit!

41:47.648 --> 41:49.583
- Huh?
- Shouldn't we be focusing

41:49.650 --> 41:51.885
on finding that third skull
before Dastardly?

41:51.952 --> 41:53.953
Or why Scooby is so important?

41:54.020 --> 41:55.487
- It could be a clue to...
- Details.

41:55.554 --> 41:58.189
All right, first things first.
Come on, Scooby-Doo!

41:58.256 --> 41:59.692
- Cool.
- Uh...

41:59.759 --> 42:01.525
Right behind you, Scoob.

42:06.031 --> 42:08.232
Drat, drat, and double drat!

42:08.298 --> 42:10.768
What is it?

42:12.502 --> 42:17.640
Scooby-Doo's friends.
How perfect.

42:17.707 --> 42:19.575
Send me
their location immediately.

42:41.194 --> 42:42.494
Oh!

42:42.562 --> 42:44.097
Huh?

42:44.164 --> 42:46.633
- Like, what's wrong?
- I don't know.

42:46.700 --> 42:48.267
Oh, looks like
that old collar's in the way

42:48.333 --> 42:49.535
of the chest panel.

43:08.719 --> 43:09.953
Huh?

43:11.755 --> 43:12.656
Hmm?

43:18.326 --> 43:20.462
Whoa. Awesome!

43:20.529 --> 43:22.296
What do you think, Raggy?

43:23.430 --> 43:24.733
Looks great.

43:33.339 --> 43:34.307
Hey.

43:34.373 --> 43:35.576
Hey, man.

43:35.642 --> 43:37.643
You're feeling left out.
I get it.

43:37.710 --> 43:39.478
Totally natural
when two buddies realize

43:39.545 --> 43:41.214
that one of them
is destined for greatness

43:41.279 --> 43:43.348
and the other one
is destined for,

43:43.415 --> 43:45.416
you know, other stuff.

43:45.483 --> 43:48.019
Look, the point is,
I got you something, too.

43:48.086 --> 43:50.021
Keith. Give it to me.

43:50.088 --> 43:51.790
My Blue Falcon Confidence Pack.

43:51.857 --> 43:53.524
Retails for $99.95.

43:53.591 --> 43:55.391
You got your
<i>Blue Falcon Nutrition Guide,</i>

43:55.458 --> 43:56.660
Blue Falcon resistance bands,

43:56.727 --> 43:58.896
a copy of
my dad's autobiography,

43:58.963 --> 43:59.997
<i>No Falcon Around,</i>

44:00.064 --> 44:01.931
and my light-hearted follow-up,

44:01.998 --> 44:03.332
<i>Just Falcon Around.</i>

44:03.867 --> 44:04.901
Oh, thanks, man.

44:04.968 --> 44:06.803
It means a lot
to hear that from you.

44:06.870 --> 44:08.071
How do you mean?

44:08.138 --> 44:10.438
Well, you know, we both
struggle with confidence.

44:10.505 --> 44:11.707
When Dastardly attacked,

44:11.774 --> 44:13.341
we were both freaking out
and hiding.

44:13.407 --> 44:15.611
Hey! It was
a superior vantage point!

44:15.677 --> 44:18.579
But, like, your father
was this great hero, right?

44:18.646 --> 44:20.848
So, like, you're expected
to be one, too,

44:20.915 --> 44:23.518
and those are big shoes
to fill.

44:23.584 --> 44:24.919
I mean,
the pressure is monumental.

44:24.986 --> 44:26.553
Not to mention
the imposter's syndrome

44:26.620 --> 44:28.054
that comes with the territory.

44:28.121 --> 44:30.757
How do you breathe
under the weight of all that?

44:31.390 --> 44:33.358
Uh...

44:43.568 --> 44:45.469
Dyno, what do you got?

44:45.537 --> 44:46.805
The signal's too weak.

44:46.871 --> 44:48.606
I can't lock in
the exact coordinates.

44:48.673 --> 44:50.541
I'm gonna cross-check
the triangulation pattern.

44:50.607 --> 44:52.375
Oh! Super cool.

44:52.441 --> 44:54.211
Better than bowling, huh?

44:58.981 --> 44:59.882
Hurry, Fred!

44:59.949 --> 45:01.416
Shaggy and Scooby
are in trouble

45:01.483 --> 45:02.985
and your shortcut
to Dastardly Demolition

45:03.052 --> 45:04.319
is taking forever.

45:04.386 --> 45:05.587
Technically, this route

45:05.654 --> 45:07.122
is 73 meters longer
than the highway.

45:07.189 --> 45:08.790
Meters, Velma?

45:08.857 --> 45:10.292
I don't even know what that
means. What are we, in Europe?

45:12.961 --> 45:16.197
It's a quantitatively superior
measurement system.

45:16.263 --> 45:17.363
Get with the program, Fred.

45:17.430 --> 45:18.532
Oh, you mean like your program?

45:18.599 --> 45:20.701
"I'm Velma."

45:20.768 --> 45:22.836
"The world is ones and zeros."

45:22.902 --> 45:24.671
Maybe if you spent more
time reading books,

45:24.737 --> 45:26.906
- then...
- Guys! Stop.

45:26.973 --> 45:28.541
Why are we fighting?

45:30.374 --> 45:32.044
We didn't eat lunch!

45:32.110 --> 45:33.712
We're just hangry.

45:33.779 --> 45:35.881
Ever since
Shag and Scoob disappeared,

45:35.948 --> 45:37.182
there's been no one
to feed us

45:37.249 --> 45:39.250
ridiculous sandwiches at lunch.

45:39.317 --> 45:40.785
I miss them.

45:40.852 --> 45:42.720
Oh, me, too. Those little
pickles on top are the best.

45:42.787 --> 45:46.256
No! The guys,
not the sandwiches.

45:46.323 --> 45:48.058
Aw, I miss them, too.

45:53.629 --> 45:54.864
<i>Ready?</i>

45:54.930 --> 45:56.497
<i>Ready!</i>

45:56.565 --> 45:58.033
<i>Okay, Shaggy,
take the picture.</i>

45:58.100 --> 46:00.102
<i>Hurry up and take it.
This hurts my face.</i>

46:00.169 --> 46:02.604
<i>Shaggy,
you have it on video.</i>

46:02.670 --> 46:04.404
<i>Oops!</i> <i>Sorry.</i>

46:06.941 --> 46:09.810
Jinkies! Scooby and Shaggy
are with Blue Falcon?

46:09.877 --> 46:10.844
Of course.

46:10.911 --> 46:13.113
Blue light, beamed up.

46:13.180 --> 46:14.447
That's the <i>Falcon Fury.</i>

46:14.514 --> 46:15.949
How do you know so much
about superheroes

46:16.016 --> 46:18.217
and so little
about the metric system?

46:18.284 --> 46:20.586
Because I'm an American man.

46:20.653 --> 46:22.321
Oh, I'm so happy they're okay.

46:22.387 --> 46:24.456
Oh, no.

46:24.523 --> 46:25.957
Pull over.

46:26.024 --> 46:26.958
Oh, boy.

46:34.598 --> 46:36.499
Okay, guys.
Let me do the talking.

46:36.567 --> 46:39.270
I've seen <i>Cops</i>
at least six times.

46:39.336 --> 46:40.671
So, I know exactly what to say.

46:40.738 --> 46:42.372
Good evening, Officer...

46:55.817 --> 46:58.485
Fred, say something!

46:59.186 --> 47:00.588
Hi.

47:00.655 --> 47:03.257
Do you kids have any idea
how fast you were going?

47:04.659 --> 47:07.193
Was it, uh, too fast?

47:07.260 --> 47:09.629
Funny story, Officer.

47:09.696 --> 47:12.165
We were rushing
to capture this evil villain

47:12.232 --> 47:14.733
who we thought was trying
to kill our friends.

47:14.800 --> 47:17.236
Uh-huh.
Step out of the vehicle.

47:17.303 --> 47:19.538
All of you.

47:19.605 --> 47:21.172
You've gotta
believe us, Officer.

47:21.239 --> 47:23.074
This guy is really dangerous.

47:23.141 --> 47:25.310
Ooh, dangerous.

47:25.376 --> 47:26.611
Sounds like he's a...

47:27.245 --> 47:28.546
handsome guy.

47:28.613 --> 47:32.582
Oh, no, no.
Bulbous nose. Huge chin.

47:32.649 --> 47:36.053
Yeah, but in a cool way,
like Gérard Depardieu.

47:36.119 --> 47:38.486
No, in a super gross way.

47:38.554 --> 47:41.924
Like a rat and a mound
of hair had a baby.

47:41.991 --> 47:43.693
How dare you!

47:45.593 --> 47:47.162
Dick Dastardly!

47:47.228 --> 47:49.998
I have so many mixed feelings.

47:50.699 --> 47:52.067
How did you find us?

47:52.133 --> 47:55.402
Oh, let's just say
I had insider information.

48:07.246 --> 48:09.348
You have the right
to remain silent.

48:10.782 --> 48:13.418
And everything you said
about my face...

48:14.987 --> 48:18.155
...will be used against you
in a court of claw!

48:25.996 --> 48:27.063
Ah.

48:34.303 --> 48:36.672
Mm.

48:36.739 --> 48:39.375
Does this make
my ears look big?

48:39.441 --> 48:41.209
Makes your ego
look big.

48:41.275 --> 48:42.643
What did you say?

48:42.710 --> 48:46.914
I said, uh, fine.
You look, uh, fine.

48:46.981 --> 48:48.950
It sounded like you said "ego."

48:49.017 --> 48:51.486
Nope. Must be in your head.

48:51.551 --> 48:54.287
- Hmm.
- Your giant, inflated head.

48:54.354 --> 48:55.722
- What?
- Nothing.

48:55.789 --> 48:57.857
Scooby! We need you!

49:07.500 --> 49:08.800
As far as masks go,

49:08.867 --> 49:11.202
I gotta say,
she was pretty hot.

49:11.269 --> 49:12.804
Fred, focus.

49:12.871 --> 49:15.105
We've got to find a way
to contact Scooby and Shaggy.

49:15.172 --> 49:17.274
There goes the last bobby pin.

49:19.276 --> 49:21.044
Daphne, what are you doing?

49:21.110 --> 49:23.112
If Scooby and Shaggy were here,

49:23.179 --> 49:26.082
they would accidentally sit
on a rigged chair,

49:26.149 --> 49:27.784
or bump their heads
against a wall

49:27.850 --> 49:29.818
and it would open
a secret passage out of here.

49:29.885 --> 49:32.821
They are surprisingly
effective goofballs.

49:32.888 --> 49:35.525
Whoa!

49:35.590 --> 49:37.291
Ow.

49:39.827 --> 49:43.631
Aw. Poor little thing.

49:43.697 --> 49:45.999
Uh, Daph, he's not on our side.

49:48.068 --> 49:49.135
Do you need help?

49:50.336 --> 49:52.739
It's okay. I want to help you.

50:03.381 --> 50:04.282
Better?

50:09.786 --> 50:12.055
Aw, you're welcome.

50:12.523 --> 50:14.191
Hey, hey.

50:14.257 --> 50:17.026
Do you think you can help us
get out of here, little buddy?

50:32.575 --> 50:33.874
Cool.

50:35.876 --> 50:39.680
Now, reveal
the final skull to me.

50:39.746 --> 50:41.647
Your reunion is nigh!

50:41.714 --> 50:45.318
My heart's desire
is within reach!

50:55.327 --> 50:56.728
Perfect. We have it!

50:56.795 --> 50:59.663
Set a course
for Messick Mountain!

50:59.730 --> 51:00.798
Messick Mountain?

51:00.865 --> 51:02.199
We can't let him
get there first.

51:02.266 --> 51:04.702
We have to warn Blue Falcon.

51:23.151 --> 51:25.219
Huh? There's
a communications device.

51:26.287 --> 51:27.955
I'm gonna see
if I can find a backdoor

51:28.022 --> 51:30.257
into Blue Falcon's comms,

51:30.323 --> 51:32.792
but I have no idea
what I'm patching into.

51:34.194 --> 51:37.363
I've narrowed my search down
to 11 possible hot spots.

51:37.429 --> 51:39.698
Oh. That one is a volcano.

51:39.765 --> 51:41.433
Ten possible hot spots.

51:44.003 --> 51:45.770
We need to search...

51:45.837 --> 51:49.107
I suddenly feel funky.

51:49.174 --> 51:51.309
- And I'm in.
- I've been hacked.

51:54.144 --> 51:55.979
- Dynomutt!
- <i>Emergency.</i>

51:56.046 --> 51:57.748
<i>Blue Falcon, come in,
Blue Falcon!</i>

51:57.814 --> 51:59.283
I repeat, this is an emergency.

51:59.349 --> 52:01.984
Stay out of
my search history.

52:02.051 --> 52:03.352
<i>My name is Velma Dinkley.</i>

52:03.419 --> 52:05.221
Who names their kid Velma?

52:05.288 --> 52:06.889
<i>We are
prisoners of Dick Dastardly!</i>

52:06.956 --> 52:08.424
Yikes! Where are you?

52:08.492 --> 52:09.991
<i>I don't know,
but we're heading towards</i>

52:10.058 --> 52:11.927
<i>a place
called Messick Mountain.</i>

52:11.993 --> 52:14.429
That's close to
a possible third hot spot!

52:16.331 --> 52:17.364
That's it!

52:17.431 --> 52:19.099
The skull must be
beneath the mountain!

52:19.166 --> 52:20.502
That was unpleasant.

52:20.569 --> 52:24.705
Hello? Hello?
Where are Scooby and Shaggy?

52:24.772 --> 52:28.174
- Hello? Hello?
- Whoa!

52:28.241 --> 52:30.410
- We lost the signal.
- Velma?

52:34.514 --> 52:35.481
Check it.

52:35.548 --> 52:37.916
That's a lock. But to where?

52:40.319 --> 52:42.420
The Gates to the Underworld.

52:42.487 --> 52:43.888
It all makes sense now.

52:43.955 --> 52:46.190
Oh, boy.
That's the serious face.

52:46.257 --> 52:47.992
We always get in trouble
after that face.

52:48.059 --> 52:50.961
Alexander the Great and
Peritas conquered the world

52:51.027 --> 52:53.664
and built the gates to protect
their enormous treasure.

52:53.730 --> 52:55.098
That's where the lock comes in.

52:55.165 --> 52:58.434
Only Alexander or Peritas
can unlock it.

52:58.501 --> 53:01.103
Or one of their descendants.

53:01.170 --> 53:03.239
Dastardly's going to
use Scooby

53:03.305 --> 53:05.440
to unlock the
Gates to the Underworld.

53:05.507 --> 53:07.342
So what? What happens then?

53:07.408 --> 53:10.311
Then all hell breaks loose.
Literally.

53:10.378 --> 53:12.581
There's more than treasure
behind those gates.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.549
Oh, jinkies.

53:14.616 --> 53:17.251
What? I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Someone had to say it.

53:17.317 --> 53:18.185
Look over there.

53:23.256 --> 53:24.156
Whoa.

53:25.958 --> 53:27.426
"Muttley."

53:27.494 --> 53:28.427
Put that down!

53:31.062 --> 53:34.634
You have no right
to be in here, Mystery Morons.

53:34.700 --> 53:36.034
It's Mystery Inc.

53:36.101 --> 53:37.801
Yeah, Fred. He knows.

53:37.868 --> 53:39.069
Who is Muttley?

53:41.071 --> 53:43.475
Muttley was my partner...

53:43.541 --> 53:45.775
my criminal co-conspirator.

53:45.842 --> 53:49.345
Until... Until...

53:49.412 --> 53:52.814
<i>I opened a portal,
a backdoor to the underworld.</i>

53:52.881 --> 53:56.519
<i>And through it,
a glowing gold vision.</i>

54:00.821 --> 54:03.124
<i>As I was about to enter,</i>

54:03.190 --> 54:06.861
<i>Muttley insisted on taking
the risk himself.</i>

54:07.828 --> 54:09.463
Rasm-Frasm.

54:09.530 --> 54:11.097
Ingrate.

54:13.867 --> 54:15.101
<i>I pleaded with him,</i>

54:15.168 --> 54:17.537
<i>"Muttley,
please don't do this."</i>

54:17.604 --> 54:21.708
<i>But no. The flatulent fleabag
wouldn't listen to reason.</i>

54:23.942 --> 54:25.810
Ta-da!

54:25.877 --> 54:27.713
Good boy, Muttley. Bring it!

54:27.780 --> 54:29.782
Yes, yes, come on.

54:29.847 --> 54:32.651
<i>But that ticket
was a one-way trip.</i>

54:32.717 --> 54:34.084
Muttley?

54:34.151 --> 54:36.286
<i>Even if I'd opened
a billion portals,</i>

54:36.353 --> 54:37.888
<i>he could never come back.</i>

54:37.954 --> 54:39.856
- Uh-oh.
- Muttley!

54:40.390 --> 54:41.758
Oh, no. No!

54:41.824 --> 54:43.527
Get out of there!

54:43.593 --> 54:46.996
Muttley! Muttley!

54:48.264 --> 54:51.099
Because Muttley isn't the key.

54:52.300 --> 54:53.569
Return them to their cell.

54:53.636 --> 54:55.070
Please, Dastardly,

54:55.136 --> 54:56.639
if you unlock those gates,
you'll...

54:56.705 --> 54:58.305
Stop!

54:58.372 --> 55:00.742
Poor man's Hemsworth
stays with me.

55:00.809 --> 55:01.810
- No.
- How dare you?

55:01.875 --> 55:03.511
Wait. Chris or Liam?

55:03.578 --> 55:05.311
What are you doing with him?

55:05.378 --> 55:09.315
Oh, I have grand plans
for Freddie boy.

55:15.521 --> 55:17.490
I'm picking up
the skull signature.

55:17.557 --> 55:19.157
Locking on.

55:19.224 --> 55:20.593
These suits
are incredible, right?

55:20.660 --> 55:22.026
Yeah!

55:22.093 --> 55:23.695
Accentuates the good stuff,
hides the flaws.

55:23.762 --> 55:25.096
I love it.

55:25.162 --> 55:26.832
I wanna see
cheeks to seats, people.

55:26.897 --> 55:28.099
Straps activated.

55:28.165 --> 55:29.834
But my cheeks
still need a seat!

55:29.899 --> 55:31.669
Here we go!

55:45.848 --> 55:48.082
Shaggy, what are you doing?

55:55.723 --> 55:56.890
Not so close.

55:56.957 --> 55:58.091
We're about to get closer.

55:58.158 --> 55:59.627
- Dee Dee, I advise we...
- Punch it!

56:10.068 --> 56:12.471
Wow. The heat
from the geothermal vents

56:12.538 --> 56:16.040
is creating
a completely unique ecosystem.

56:16.107 --> 56:18.075
Which appears to be Mesozoic.

56:24.681 --> 56:26.115
Just land the ship, Dee Dee!

56:40.662 --> 56:43.498
Okay, Falcon Force.
Good luck.

56:43.565 --> 56:44.999
Bring back that skull.

56:45.065 --> 56:46.535
Scooby and I will stay
on the ship.

56:46.601 --> 56:48.437
You know,
where it's safe and secure.

56:48.503 --> 56:51.371
Dude, I'm pretty sure Scooby
is gonna be safest with us.

56:51.439 --> 56:53.072
We're literally superheroes.

56:53.139 --> 56:55.108
No, you don't get it.

56:55.175 --> 56:57.644
We're chickens
and we always stick together,

56:57.710 --> 56:59.111
so we're staying here.

56:59.612 --> 57:00.547
Scoob?

57:00.613 --> 57:01.815
Scoob's clearly important

57:01.881 --> 57:04.551
to whatever Dastardly's
got planned. We need him.

57:04.616 --> 57:07.118
Yeah. I'm the key.

57:07.185 --> 57:09.987
The key? You're not the key.

57:10.054 --> 57:11.890
You're my best friend.

57:11.956 --> 57:13.223
At least I thought you were

57:13.290 --> 57:15.292
until you whipped off
your collar.

57:15.358 --> 57:18.962
My collar? You gave me the nod.

57:19.029 --> 57:21.565
But I didn't think
you'd really do it.

57:21.631 --> 57:22.998
Just come with us.

57:23.065 --> 57:24.967
"Us"? You're an "us" now?

57:25.034 --> 57:26.870
Well, what happened to us-us?

57:26.937 --> 57:28.237
Raggy.

57:28.304 --> 57:30.038
You need to choose.

57:30.940 --> 57:32.240
Now, I'm staying on the ship.

57:32.307 --> 57:34.743
Are you staying with me,
or going with them?

57:34.810 --> 57:36.344
That's not fair.

57:36.911 --> 57:38.045
Choose.

57:45.619 --> 57:49.288
I never thought I'd say this,
but Simon Cowell was right.

57:49.355 --> 57:51.758
You can't count on friendship.

57:59.532 --> 58:01.833
You know what?
Simon Cowell is always right.

58:01.900 --> 58:03.200
He gave the world
Kelly Clarkson.

58:03.267 --> 58:05.871
I mean, how much proof
do you need?

58:05.937 --> 58:07.506
Hey, man,
that breakup was brutal.

58:07.572 --> 58:09.405
All right, Shaggy was totally
out of line.

58:09.473 --> 58:12.710
We've never had
a fight before.

58:12.776 --> 58:14.110
Brian!

58:14.177 --> 58:16.579
Less talk, more walk!

58:16.646 --> 58:19.314
See? I'm dealing with
the same thing with Dynobutt.

58:19.381 --> 58:20.884
He's constantly riding me.

58:20.950 --> 58:23.953
He expects me to be
just like my dad, and I'm not.

58:24.019 --> 58:25.454
No, you're not.

58:25.521 --> 58:27.756
All I need is a moment.
A hero moment.

58:27.823 --> 58:30.626
To prove to him and the world
that I can do this.

58:30.692 --> 58:32.793
Maybe we both do.

58:36.363 --> 58:38.298
This thing still isn't working.

58:38.365 --> 58:40.001
Dyno, what do you got?

58:42.134 --> 58:43.637
I got bupkis.

58:43.703 --> 58:45.505
Who needs your techno-malarkey
when we got this guy?

58:45.572 --> 58:48.941
Now, let's let the real dog
sniff out this bone.

58:52.945 --> 58:53.812
Got it!

58:57.015 --> 58:58.416
Have fun being last!

59:20.168 --> 59:21.268
What are you doing?

59:21.335 --> 59:23.772
Huh. Raggy's never missed.

59:24.639 --> 59:25.974
Hello!

59:26.041 --> 59:30.044
Your tiny little brains
probably can't understand me.

59:30.109 --> 59:34.448
So, I will speak slowly,

59:34.515 --> 59:35.950
so that you may process

59:36.016 --> 59:39.184
the welcoming tones
of my voice.

59:39.251 --> 59:41.654
Uh, we understand
you perfectly.

59:41.721 --> 59:43.423
Oh, word? No disrespect.

59:43.489 --> 59:45.256
So, what brings you guys
to Mystery Island?

59:45.323 --> 59:46.992
We're looking for a skull.

59:47.059 --> 59:48.225
Yeah, it's about yea high,

59:48.292 --> 59:49.360
and full of sharp,
pointy teeth.

59:49.428 --> 59:51.162
You mean a slaghoople?

59:51.228 --> 59:52.597
Um, sure.

59:52.663 --> 59:54.632
Why didn't you say so?
Follow me.

59:54.699 --> 59:56.701
And mind
the pterodactyl droppings.

01:00:00.937 --> 01:00:02.137
But if you
get some on you, rub it in.

01:00:02.204 --> 01:00:03.640
It's just like lotion.

01:00:07.644 --> 01:00:08.510
Huh?

01:00:26.426 --> 01:00:29.796
I will never leave you.
No matter what.

01:00:33.566 --> 01:00:35.401
Huh?

01:00:39.905 --> 01:00:40.905
Hey!

01:00:40.972 --> 01:00:41.973
Fred?

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.942
- Shaggy?
- Fred!

01:00:44.009 --> 01:00:45.577
Shaggy!

01:00:45.644 --> 01:00:48.479
Wait, how'd you get here?
Where are Daphne and Velma?

01:00:48.545 --> 01:00:50.047
Dastardly kidnapped us

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:54.084
and was holding us captive
on his super awesome airship.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.819
Jeez, that thing is cool.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.186
But never mind that.

01:00:58.253 --> 01:01:00.288
Where's Scooby-Doo?
Has he been taken?

01:01:00.355 --> 01:01:04.093
No. He's with
his new "hero" friends.

01:01:04.159 --> 01:01:07.228
We're on a break.
You've missed a lot.

01:01:07.294 --> 01:01:08.295
Shaggy,

01:01:08.362 --> 01:01:10.132
Scooby-Doo is in grave danger.

01:01:10.197 --> 01:01:11.466
Dastardly's on his way here
right now,

01:01:11.533 --> 01:01:13.701
and he won't stop
until he gets him.

01:01:13.768 --> 01:01:16.771
Dastardly?
We can't let that happen.

01:01:16.837 --> 01:01:19.907
Exactly!
Now, take me to Scooby-Doo.

01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:22.575
As it turns out,

01:01:22.642 --> 01:01:25.645
I wasn't even
the velociraptor's father.

01:01:25.712 --> 01:01:30.314
Anyhoo, there it is.
The slaghoople.

01:01:30.381 --> 01:01:32.751
Brian, we found the last skull.

01:01:32.818 --> 01:01:34.019
Mission accomplished.

01:01:34.086 --> 01:01:36.254
Now, if you would give us
a hand carrying it out,

01:01:36.319 --> 01:01:37.187
we'll take it back to our jet.

01:01:37.254 --> 01:01:38.456
Uh-uh-uh.

01:01:38.523 --> 01:01:40.257
The only way
to take the slaghoople

01:01:40.323 --> 01:01:42.960
is to defeat the protector
in battle.

01:01:43.027 --> 01:01:44.561
And that's me.

01:01:44.628 --> 01:01:45.729
You?

01:01:45.796 --> 01:01:47.764
Scooby, this is it.
It's my hero moment.

01:01:47.831 --> 01:01:50.067
I can totally pound the crap
out of this little guy.

01:01:50.133 --> 01:01:52.069
Doesn't sound heroic.

01:01:52.135 --> 01:01:53.502
Hey, you're on,

01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:55.071
but I think you're gonna need
a few friends.

01:01:55.137 --> 01:01:59.207
Oh, I've got friends.
And they do like a good show.

01:02:14.755 --> 01:02:18.858
All right now.
Let's get our fight on!

01:02:20.159 --> 01:02:22.462
Come at me, little man.

01:02:22.528 --> 01:02:24.328
Little?

01:02:24.396 --> 01:02:25.964
Did you just call me little?

01:02:26.031 --> 01:02:27.199
No. He said big.

01:02:27.264 --> 01:02:29.300
I did call you little,
pipsqueak.

01:02:29.366 --> 01:02:30.736
He said big squeak.

01:02:30.802 --> 01:02:32.670
You can call me...

01:02:35.206 --> 01:02:40.242
Captain Caveman!

01:02:43.913 --> 01:02:47.684
I know I'm small.
It's a pituitary thing.

01:02:51.687 --> 01:02:53.956
Are you not entertained?

01:02:54.022 --> 01:02:56.256
Brian! Come on.

01:02:56.323 --> 01:02:58.860
Dynomutt is right.

01:03:00.194 --> 01:03:01.129
I'm not my dad.

01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:04.431
Scooby, help!

01:03:04.498 --> 01:03:05.465
What do I do?

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.033
Use the suit thingies.

01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.334
Who's your captain?

01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:09.770
Captain Caveman!

01:03:09.836 --> 01:03:12.005
Hoorah!

01:03:12.072 --> 01:03:13.038
Huh?

01:03:21.913 --> 01:03:23.681
Huh. Hey.

01:03:29.052 --> 01:03:31.522
Wow, you're doing great.

01:03:33.423 --> 01:03:35.192
I almost hate
to do this to you.

01:03:35.259 --> 01:03:37.727
Spin it to win it.

01:03:37.794 --> 01:03:40.730
I want my Raggy!

01:03:44.298 --> 01:03:46.501
Oh!

01:03:46.568 --> 01:03:47.736
You make a break for the skull.

01:03:47.803 --> 01:03:49.037
I'll go pick up
Brian and Scooby.

01:03:49.104 --> 01:03:50.304
On it.

01:03:50.372 --> 01:03:52.740
Leave him alone.

01:03:52.807 --> 01:03:55.709
I love a challenge
like I love dinosaur eggs.

01:03:55.776 --> 01:03:57.044
Over easy.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.682
- Uh...
- Look out!

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.353
Dang, those are
some dope wheels.

01:04:11.924 --> 01:04:14.259
Whatever wheels are!

01:04:14.325 --> 01:04:16.961
- Scooby!
- Raggy?

01:04:17.028 --> 01:04:18.830
- How'd you get here?
- No, let me go first.

01:04:18.896 --> 01:04:20.064
- Scoob...
- Where did that

01:04:20.131 --> 01:04:21.399
anachronistic van come from?

01:04:21.465 --> 01:04:22.834
Fred brought it,
but that's not important.

01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.367
How'd he get the van
to a prehistoric world

01:04:24.434 --> 01:04:25.902
hidden miles beneath
the North Pole?

01:04:25.969 --> 01:04:27.336
I don't know.
Why don't you ask Fred...

01:04:27.404 --> 01:04:28.939
Who's Fred?

01:04:29.005 --> 01:04:30.540
- ...right now, I need to...
- Not me.

01:04:35.477 --> 01:04:36.946
Dick Dastardly!

01:04:37.012 --> 01:04:38.247
That's right.

01:04:38.314 --> 01:04:39.582
Your foolish friend

01:04:39.648 --> 01:04:42.050
- led me straight to you.
- Oh, no.

01:04:47.889 --> 01:04:51.391
If you will excuse me,
I have a treasure to collect.

01:04:53.961 --> 01:04:55.329
Raggy!

01:04:55.429 --> 01:04:56.762
Scooby!

01:04:56.829 --> 01:05:00.199
Oh, and I almost forgot
to take out the rubbish.

01:05:00.266 --> 01:05:01.767
Whoa!

01:05:08.373 --> 01:05:10.842
- Whoa, nice catch!
- Ahhh!

01:05:10.909 --> 01:05:12.443
- What's up?
- Ta-ta!

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:14.211
See you all in Athens.

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:15.679
Oh! No, you won't.

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:17.815
Because the only way out
is with a jet.

01:05:17.882 --> 01:05:19.450
Well, good thing we have one.

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:22.685
Oh, do you now?

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.690
There's something
about the way he said,

01:05:28.757 --> 01:05:30.292
"Do you?" and then laughed

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.829
that makes me think
he did something to our ship.

01:05:35.797 --> 01:05:38.399
I hate it when I'm right.

01:05:38.466 --> 01:05:40.601
We're lucky
it doesn't happen often.

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:43.938
Ugh.

01:05:49.142 --> 01:05:51.645
The primary engine
is destroyed.

01:05:51.711 --> 01:05:53.045
The thrusters are intact,

01:05:53.112 --> 01:05:55.347
but they're way too small
to launch the ship.

01:05:55.414 --> 01:05:57.283
So, we're stuck here?

01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:58.617
Well, maybe
if your little buddy

01:05:58.684 --> 01:06:00.418
didn't lead the bad guy
right to us...

01:06:00.485 --> 01:06:02.353
Leave Shaggy alone.

01:06:02.453 --> 01:06:05.290
Yeah, what kind of hero blames
other people for his problems?

01:06:05.357 --> 01:06:06.392
Meet Brian.

01:06:06.457 --> 01:06:07.625
Hey, you shut your dog face.

01:06:07.692 --> 01:06:09.159
You shut your face-face.

01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:11.362
Because of you, Scooby-Doo has
a first-class ticket

01:06:11.428 --> 01:06:12.729
to the dogpocalypse.

01:06:12.796 --> 01:06:14.097
Don't you point
your finger at me.

01:06:14.164 --> 01:06:16.432
Well, don't double-point
your finger at me.

01:06:16.499 --> 01:06:18.034
Maybe I'll triple-finger point
at you.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.270
Then obviously I'm gonna
quadruple-finger point at you.

01:06:21.337 --> 01:06:22.972
Ha! That's just a wave,
dipstick.

01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:25.340
Hey, get off of him.

01:06:25.408 --> 01:06:27.309
He's the one that started it!

01:06:27.376 --> 01:06:29.277
Toxic masculinity.

01:06:29.344 --> 01:06:31.680
Stop! Stop it, all of you!

01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:35.082
It's my fault. I'm to blame.

01:06:35.149 --> 01:06:38.953
I let my own jealousy
break me and Scooby up.

01:06:39.019 --> 01:06:42.722
I was afraid that with his
new suit and his new team,

01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:44.624
things were gonna change.

01:06:46.759 --> 01:06:48.760
And they did change.

01:06:48.827 --> 01:06:52.931
But, like, that's okay.
People can grow.

01:06:52.998 --> 01:06:55.901
But it doesn't mean
that we're growing apart.

01:06:55.968 --> 01:06:58.803
Because the one thing
that will never change

01:06:58.869 --> 01:07:02.707
is that Scooby-Doo
is my best friend.

01:07:03.408 --> 01:07:04.808
Ten years ago,

01:07:04.874 --> 01:07:07.544
a little boy made a promise
to a stray puppy

01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:10.580
that he'd never leave him,
no matter what.

01:07:10.647 --> 01:07:12.748
And I'm gonna keep
that promise.

01:07:12.815 --> 01:07:15.818
Now, it's time we stop
this mustachioed menace

01:07:15.884 --> 01:07:18.020
from opening the gates
to the underpass...

01:07:18.087 --> 01:07:19.655
- Underworld.
- And letting loose

01:07:19.722 --> 01:07:21.322
the fearsome sippy-cup.

01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:22.991
- Cerberus.
- So, what do you say

01:07:23.057 --> 01:07:25.760
- we get out of Middle-earth...
- Copyright infringement.

01:07:25.827 --> 01:07:28.228
...and go get
my always-snacking,

01:07:28.295 --> 01:07:32.065
never-lacking,
often-napping dog back!

01:07:32.132 --> 01:07:33.133
Who's with me?

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.435
We are!

01:07:35.769 --> 01:07:37.203
Let's do this.

01:07:43.142 --> 01:07:44.009
Hey!

01:07:45.877 --> 01:07:48.279
That one! Thank you!

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:53.817
Momma!

01:08:07.897 --> 01:08:10.265
Dad! What is that thing?

01:08:22.276 --> 01:08:23.810
Oh, I've waited!

01:08:23.877 --> 01:08:27.046
I've waited and waited
for this very moment!

01:09:10.453 --> 01:09:11.618
Give me your paw.

01:09:11.685 --> 01:09:14.188
- No!
- What?

01:09:14.254 --> 01:09:16.990
Back again like a bad oyster.

01:09:17.057 --> 01:09:20.626
Guys, supernatural
transformation dead ahead.

01:09:23.662 --> 01:09:26.165
I thought
you mewling millennials

01:09:26.232 --> 01:09:27.033
were done for good!

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:30.068
Destroy those falcon fools!

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.618
- Yes!
- No!

01:10:09.936 --> 01:10:12.373
Whoa!

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.482
No!

01:10:22.549 --> 01:10:25.817
I told you, you were the most
important dog in the world.

01:10:25.884 --> 01:10:28.319
Now let me show you why.

01:10:32.656 --> 01:10:35.292
And the slipper fits.

01:10:39.263 --> 01:10:40.497
It's happening!

01:10:40.564 --> 01:10:42.899
It's finally happening!

01:10:52.774 --> 01:10:53.875
Uh-oh.

01:10:53.942 --> 01:10:55.677
Little more than
I bargained for.

01:10:56.977 --> 01:10:59.581
If I were you, I'd run!

01:11:06.186 --> 01:11:07.488
Monster!

01:11:07.555 --> 01:11:08.922
Hurry! Daddy!

01:11:15.861 --> 01:11:17.696
You guys are alive!

01:11:17.763 --> 01:11:19.764
Scooby-Doo!

01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:21.199
Scooby!

01:11:21.265 --> 01:11:22.568
Yoo-hoo!

01:11:22.634 --> 01:11:25.337
Oh, thank goodness! The gang's
finally back together.

01:11:25.404 --> 01:11:29.272
- Buddy, I never meant to...
- I know. Me neither.

01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.740
All right.

01:11:30.807 --> 01:11:33.243
<i>Time to take that 3-headed
hound down to the pound.</i>

01:11:34.911 --> 01:11:36.245
<i>Is everyone accounted for?</i>

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.187
Whew. Well, that was
my cardio for the day.

01:11:46.254 --> 01:11:47.956
Dynomutt, you saved us.

01:11:48.022 --> 01:11:48.990
Yeah, thank you!

01:11:49.057 --> 01:11:50.392
Yes, Dynomutt!

01:12:08.139 --> 01:12:11.843
At long last, my treasure!

01:12:23.153 --> 01:12:24.153
Oh, no.

01:12:25.623 --> 01:12:27.023
I'm too late.

01:12:29.292 --> 01:12:32.160
I've been searching for years,
my friend.

01:12:32.227 --> 01:12:34.330
But I didn't make it in time.

01:12:37.567 --> 01:12:38.800
I'm sorry.

01:12:39.569 --> 01:12:43.472
I'm so, so sorry.

01:12:43.538 --> 01:12:45.072
There are so many things

01:12:45.139 --> 01:12:47.108
we never got to do together.

01:12:51.545 --> 01:12:53.046
Huh?

01:12:53.113 --> 01:12:55.516
You're alive?

01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:57.016
You're alive!

01:12:57.082 --> 01:13:00.252
You cantankerous canine,
how could you do that to me?

01:13:01.053 --> 01:13:03.222
Rasm-Frasm.

01:13:04.523 --> 01:13:06.492
Stop! I'm not joking! Stop!

01:13:08.527 --> 01:13:09.994
Oh! I...

01:13:10.061 --> 01:13:11.696
I can't stay mad.

01:13:11.763 --> 01:13:13.564
You're alive!

01:13:23.005 --> 01:13:25.642
So, that's Cerberus.

01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:28.444
We've got to stop him
before he gets into the city.

01:13:28.511 --> 01:13:29.811
Like, how?

01:13:29.878 --> 01:13:31.347
We fight monsters
all the time.

01:13:31.414 --> 01:13:32.914
Remember the phantom sea squid
at the haunted aquarium?

01:13:32.981 --> 01:13:34.550
That was
a real estate developer

01:13:34.617 --> 01:13:37.117
with a couple of flashlights
and a sound effects machine.

01:13:37.184 --> 01:13:39.454
This is the real deal.
Right, Fred?

01:13:39.953 --> 01:13:41.021
Fred?

01:13:41.623 --> 01:13:42.490
Where's Fred?

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:49.396
You shall be avenged.

01:13:59.904 --> 01:14:02.973
For the Mystery Machine!

01:14:06.411 --> 01:14:07.911
He's just attacking.

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:09.447
I mean, are we supposed
to be attacking?

01:14:10.715 --> 01:14:12.882
Huh?

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:19.254
- Fred!
- Come on. Hurry! Run!

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:25.294
Sorry, gang. Never mess
with another man's vehicle.

01:14:26.861 --> 01:14:28.297
We need a plan.

01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:31.065
Okay, like, Velma and Fred,
you get to the gate

01:14:31.132 --> 01:14:33.033
and, uh, figure out
how to close it.

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.836
And we'll distract Cerberus.

01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:36.304
Great idea, guys.

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.438
That was awesome!

01:14:37.505 --> 01:14:38.840
Smart.

01:14:38.905 --> 01:14:41.475
Yeah,
we've been through a lot.

01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:42.908
We've grown.

01:14:46.011 --> 01:14:48.146
Brian!

01:14:48.213 --> 01:14:51.015
Go! Go, go, go, go, go!

01:14:54.387 --> 01:14:55.454
Now, Velma!

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.454
Let's go!

01:14:57.822 --> 01:14:58.956
What do we do?

01:14:59.022 --> 01:15:01.125
Maybe he wants a Scooby Snack?

01:15:02.259 --> 01:15:04.227
I don't have any Scooby Snacks.

01:15:05.228 --> 01:15:06.530
I always have a spare.

01:15:08.866 --> 01:15:10.199
Sorry.

01:15:10.266 --> 01:15:12.267
And that's why
I always have a spare spare.

01:15:13.836 --> 01:15:15.605
Scooby!

01:15:15.671 --> 01:15:17.172
I'm so weak.

01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:20.975
<i>Nice doggy.</i>

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:24.679
I got this.

01:15:41.594 --> 01:15:42.595
Look out!

01:15:46.565 --> 01:15:49.233
Are you okay, little guy?

01:15:53.337 --> 01:15:56.607
Brian, what are you
doing back here?

01:15:56.674 --> 01:15:57.941
I'm calling my dad.

01:15:58.342 --> 01:15:59.176
Hey!

01:15:59.242 --> 01:16:00.943
You don't need your dad.

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:03.179
Yes, I do, all right?
He's the hero.

01:16:03.245 --> 01:16:04.581
I'm not. I can't win this.

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:07.183
So what?
Look at Scooby and Shaggy!

01:16:07.249 --> 01:16:10.018
They're terrified, and they're
taking on Cerberus!

01:16:10.084 --> 01:16:11.520
I'm terrified!

01:16:11.587 --> 01:16:15.056
Why are we
taking on Cerberus?

01:16:19.993 --> 01:16:21.729
Well, in their own unique way.

01:16:21.796 --> 01:16:24.096
So you're saying it's heroic
to be scared,

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:25.998
and even to lose sometimes?

01:16:27.568 --> 01:16:29.168
Dude, this is it!

01:16:29.235 --> 01:16:32.805
This is my hero moment,
my real hero moment.

01:16:32.872 --> 01:16:34.272
And it's my moment, too.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.274
My job is to have your back.

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:39.411
So what do you say,
Blue Falcon?

01:16:41.546 --> 01:16:44.048
Okay, now I'm crying.

01:16:44.114 --> 01:16:45.550
- Dyno!
- Help!

01:16:45.617 --> 01:16:48.117
Scooby and Shaggy
are about to be puppy chow.

01:16:48.184 --> 01:16:51.856
It's time for you
to spread your wings and fly.

01:16:51.922 --> 01:16:53.324
You're right.

01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:54.692
This suit just makes me a hero
on the outside.

01:16:54.758 --> 01:16:57.760
It's time to tap
into the hero. In here.

01:16:57.827 --> 01:17:00.730
You know your suit has actual
wings and can fly, right?

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:05.767
Oh, right. The wings!

01:17:07.503 --> 01:17:08.403
Let's do this!

01:17:12.273 --> 01:17:15.242
I got a little too excited
on the takeoff.

01:17:15.309 --> 01:17:17.311
This way, Scooby-Doo!

01:17:25.352 --> 01:17:26.386
Oh, Cerberus.

01:17:26.453 --> 01:17:28.554
Here, poochie-boy.

01:17:39.964 --> 01:17:41.633
This superhero stuff is fun!

01:17:41.699 --> 01:17:43.066
Whoa!

01:17:43.901 --> 01:17:46.135
Scooby!

01:17:46.202 --> 01:17:48.739
- I got you.
- Ooh.

01:17:48.805 --> 01:17:49.973
Farewell, fools!

01:17:50.039 --> 01:17:51.741
<i>Sayonara,</i> suckers!

01:17:51.807 --> 01:17:52.708
Dastardly!

01:17:52.775 --> 01:17:54.010
We're rich!

01:17:54.075 --> 01:17:56.345
Rasm-Frasm. Money bath!

01:17:56.412 --> 01:17:58.213
Aw. He got his friend back.

01:17:58.281 --> 01:17:59.948
Daphne, focus.

01:18:00.015 --> 01:18:02.751
I wish I had that
clue from Dastardly's ship.

01:18:02.817 --> 01:18:04.786
You mean this thing?

01:18:04.853 --> 01:18:06.655
Are you telling me
you had that the whole time?

01:18:06.721 --> 01:18:08.889
Better late than never!

01:18:08.956 --> 01:18:10.424
This is awesome!

01:18:10.491 --> 01:18:12.693
Oh, good.
They got him distracted.

01:18:13.226 --> 01:18:14.762
Hey, little guy.

01:18:14.828 --> 01:18:15.995
Remember at the bowling alley

01:18:16.061 --> 01:18:17.697
when you transformed
into that thing?

01:18:19.365 --> 01:18:21.166
No. No, no, no.
Not that scary thing.

01:18:21.233 --> 01:18:23.535
Huh.
Looks like a riddle.

01:18:23.602 --> 01:18:25.069
Or a prophecy?

01:18:25.136 --> 01:18:27.306
"Two brothers
bridge the earthly void.

01:18:27.372 --> 01:18:30.375
One man, one dog.
The key employed."

01:18:30.442 --> 01:18:32.610
"One to open, two to close,

01:18:32.677 --> 01:18:37.348
a pair whose friendship
forever grows."

01:18:37.415 --> 01:18:41.150
That's it! It takes
one to open but two to lock.

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:44.788
Okay.
Before the creepy scorpion

01:18:44.854 --> 01:18:46.323
but after the scary pin.

01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:49.123
Yeah. Yeah, that's it!

01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:50.693
But there's a catch.

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:06.105
Incoming! We've gotta get
Cerberus closer to the gate!

01:19:06.172 --> 01:19:07.239
On it!

01:19:11.078 --> 01:19:13.211
Here, doggy, doggy, doggy.

01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:36.733
Man, looks like
we just spared the world!

01:19:36.799 --> 01:19:39.669
Bowling puns.

01:19:39.736 --> 01:19:41.304
This is so us.

01:19:47.208 --> 01:19:49.544
Okay, so how do we lock
that puppy up?

01:19:52.813 --> 01:19:53.981
What?

01:19:54.048 --> 01:19:56.117
One of you has to hold
the gates shut here...

01:19:56.182 --> 01:20:00.453
While one of you locks them
from inside the Underworld.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.688
What? No!

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:04.591
There has to be another way.
Right, Velma?

01:20:04.658 --> 01:20:06.393
Alexander the Great
built these gates

01:20:06.459 --> 01:20:11.063
to be locked only by him
and his dog Peritas.

01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:14.232
As the last descendant
of Peritas,

01:20:14.299 --> 01:20:15.900
Scooby has to do it.

01:20:15.967 --> 01:20:19.404
But the prophecy says he needs
his best friend to help him.

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:20.838
That's you, Shaggy.

01:20:31.247 --> 01:20:34.350
There's no other way.
I'm the key.

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:35.918
I'll go.

01:20:46.695 --> 01:20:49.263
It says one of us
had to be on the inside,

01:20:49.329 --> 01:20:51.230
but it doesn't say which one.

01:20:51.298 --> 01:20:53.434
No!

01:20:59.372 --> 01:21:04.042
Buddy, back when we were kids,
you saved me.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:05.243
Now it's my turn.

01:21:06.311 --> 01:21:08.780
No. Don't. Raggy, wait!

01:21:08.847 --> 01:21:10.682
No!

01:21:18.055 --> 01:21:19.556
Raggy.

01:21:19.622 --> 01:21:22.959
Scoob. You're the best friend
I could ever ask for.

01:21:24.794 --> 01:21:27.796
And you always will be.

01:22:20.276 --> 01:22:23.545
Raggy.

01:22:23.612 --> 01:22:25.547
Are we missing something?

01:22:25.614 --> 01:22:28.150
"A pair whose friendship
forever grows."

01:22:29.284 --> 01:22:31.585
Could it mean something else?

01:22:31.652 --> 01:22:33.988
I think it means that
Scoob and Shaggy's friendship

01:22:34.054 --> 01:22:37.625
will live on whether
they're together or not.

01:22:39.826 --> 01:22:41.861
But...

01:22:41.928 --> 01:22:43.663
...why would
Alexander make a gate

01:22:43.730 --> 01:22:46.466
that would separate him
from his best friend forever?

01:22:46.533 --> 01:22:48.901
He must have built a way out.

01:22:49.868 --> 01:22:51.570
Uh... Guys.

01:22:55.139 --> 01:22:56.808
It's Alexander the Great.

01:22:59.744 --> 01:23:02.580
Look at this inscription.
It's a message from him.

01:23:02.647 --> 01:23:05.415
"Our bond
will never break or bend..."

01:23:05.482 --> 01:23:10.887
"So, my friend, it's time
to return to your home."

01:23:10.954 --> 01:23:12.988
Maybe Scooby
should give it a try.

01:23:22.397 --> 01:23:26.467
Raggy, you promised
you'd never leave.

01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:28.068
Come home.

01:23:38.278 --> 01:23:39.412
Raggy?

01:23:43.849 --> 01:23:44.916
Zoinks!

01:23:44.983 --> 01:23:48.420
I guess friendship
really did save the day.

01:23:48.486 --> 01:23:49.521
Raggy!

01:23:49.588 --> 01:23:52.122
Scooby-Doo!

01:23:54.124 --> 01:23:56.093
I love you guys!

01:23:58.562 --> 01:24:00.897
You gave us
quite a scare, Shaggy.

01:24:05.034 --> 01:24:07.803
Well, it takes more
than a 3-headed monster

01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:10.839
to keep me away
from my best bud.

01:24:11.707 --> 01:24:14.009
Tank, empath, brain.

01:24:15.376 --> 01:24:17.246
I finally figured out
what you guys are.

01:24:17.312 --> 01:24:19.814
You're the heart
of Mystery, Inc.

01:24:26.953 --> 01:24:28.655
Ow, ow, oh. Ow!

01:24:28.722 --> 01:24:31.724
Sorry. Metal tongue.
Shoulda thought that through.

01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:34.627
Put me down,
you traitorous tin cans!

01:24:37.364 --> 01:24:41.032
Rasm-Frasm. Stupid robots.

01:24:41.099 --> 01:24:44.102
Time to pay for your crimes,
Dick Dastardly.

01:24:44.168 --> 01:24:45.637
Or is it?

01:24:48.438 --> 01:24:50.308
Simon Cowell?

01:24:51.842 --> 01:24:54.245
Wow, that is
a solid impersonation.

01:24:54.312 --> 01:24:55.279
Thank you.

01:24:55.345 --> 01:24:57.079
I also played Rum Tum Tugger

01:24:57.146 --> 01:25:00.350
in my secondary school's
production of <i>Cats.</i>

01:25:00.416 --> 01:25:01.584
This makes no sense.

01:25:01.651 --> 01:25:02.852
How could he have time to judge

01:25:02.918 --> 01:25:04.220
the world's
greatest talent shows

01:25:04.287 --> 01:25:05.587
and build a giant airship?

01:25:07.689 --> 01:25:09.691
Dick Dastardly?

01:25:09.758 --> 01:25:12.893
Drat. No one ever goes
for the double unmasking.

01:25:14.762 --> 01:25:16.497
You are coming with us.

01:25:16.563 --> 01:25:18.198
I would've gotten away with it

01:25:18.266 --> 01:25:19.300
if it weren't for you

01:25:19.366 --> 01:25:23.036
mismatched meddling miscreants!

01:25:23.102 --> 01:25:26.039
Congratulations, you two.

01:25:26.105 --> 01:25:27.172
You just saved the world.

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.140
How do you feel?

01:25:29.242 --> 01:25:30.343
Hungry.

01:25:38.216 --> 01:25:42.620
Oh, man. It's perfect.

01:25:42.687 --> 01:25:44.688
Wait, Shaggy,
where's the DJ you hired?

01:25:44.754 --> 01:25:46.823
Like, they'll be here
any minute.

01:25:46.890 --> 01:25:47.657
"They"?

01:26:04.605 --> 01:26:05.873
Surprise!

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.874
You know we wouldn't
miss your grand opening.

01:26:07.941 --> 01:26:10.644
<i>DJ Blue Falcon!</i>

01:26:13.547 --> 01:26:16.549
And that is how
you make an entrance.

01:26:17.116 --> 01:26:18.318
Good job, Keith.

01:26:18.385 --> 01:26:19.652
<i>Thank you, BF!</i>

01:26:30.762 --> 01:26:33.197
I'm so happy you're back.

01:26:37.469 --> 01:26:38.835
You know, I'm proud of him,

01:26:38.901 --> 01:26:40.837
but he couldn't have done this
without us.

01:26:40.903 --> 01:26:44.607
I know.
I am so gonna need a raise.

01:26:52.315 --> 01:26:53.216
Hello?

01:26:53.282 --> 01:26:54.849
<i>Hello, Mystery Inc.?</i>

01:26:54.915 --> 01:26:56.951
<i>There's been a mysterious
sighting in San Pedro.</i>

01:26:57.018 --> 01:26:59.520
<i>Residents report seeing
a phantom tuna trawler</i>

01:26:59.587 --> 01:27:01.188
<i>and the ghost
of an old sea captain.</i>

01:27:01.256 --> 01:27:02.424
G-g-g-ghost?

01:27:02.491 --> 01:27:03.957
Looks like we're on the case.

01:27:04.024 --> 01:27:05.058
Let's hit it.

01:27:05.125 --> 01:27:07.660
Hey, Dusty!
Watch the shop, please.

01:27:08.962 --> 01:27:10.929
What do you say, buddy?

01:27:10.996 --> 01:27:14.166
Let's Scooby-Dooby-Doo it!
