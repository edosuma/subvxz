00:26.652 --> 00:28.112
Hi.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.241
Well, good morning, everybody.
My name is Elaine,

00:32.241 --> 00:34.910
and it is my pleasure today
to show you

00:34.910 --> 00:36.287
what we do
here at CompWare.

00:36.287 --> 00:38.622
So why don't you all
come on back?

00:38.622 --> 00:40.708
Okay.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.878
Now, can anybody tell me
what a coder does?

00:43.878 --> 00:46.046
'Cause I seriously don't know
some days.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.801
- I do!
- Yes.

00:50.801 --> 00:53.429
- Coders write the games.
- That is correct.

00:53.429 --> 00:56.974
Coders write the games, but they
do not create the games.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.935
For that,
we rely on one person.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.062
Our great creator
in the sky.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.609
Who'd like to meet him?

01:06.609 --> 01:08.152
Okay.

01:12.490 --> 01:15.868
Sang-woo was just 13 years
of age when he published

01:15.868 --> 01:19.914
his first game, made in his tiny
bedroom in Busan, South Korea.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.374
Can anybody tell me
the name of that game?

01:22.374 --> 01:24.460
"Fuck Dragons".

01:24.460 --> 01:27.421
Actually, F-Dragons was
a later release.

01:27.421 --> 01:30.090
His first game was "Skittle
Dolly", which, to date,

01:30.090 --> 01:32.968
has garnered over
37 million downloads.

01:32.968 --> 01:36.680
Seven years later, Sang has over
100 original games on the market

01:36.680 --> 01:38.682
and many more in development.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.976
Obviously,
Sang is a very busy man,

01:40.976 --> 01:43.979
but I'm sure he'd just love
to say hello to y'all.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.982
And, maybe if you guys
ask nicely,

01:46.982 --> 01:49.568
he'll let you guys play
an exciting new demo

01:49.568 --> 01:51.821
of a game we've been working on.

01:51.821 --> 01:53.656
Just give me one second.

02:02.248 --> 02:05.251
Hi. The children from Glendale
Middle are here to see you.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.921
Okay.

02:08.921 --> 02:11.507
Alright. Here we go.
Come on in.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.509
Don't be shy,
he won't bite.

02:17.346 --> 02:18.764
Okay.

02:26.272 --> 02:28.190
He's got tiny people
in with him.

02:28.190 --> 02:31.485
How long are these little
fuckers gonna be in there?

02:31.485 --> 02:34.154
Um, if he needs his ego stroked,
30 minutes, but if not

02:34.154 --> 02:36.073
they'll be out in three.
What do you need?

02:36.073 --> 02:38.784
I actually have an idea that I
wanted to pitch to him.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.703
- You know how that tends to go.
- Uh-huh.

02:40.703 --> 02:43.414
Yeah, but this time,
I decided to take your advice,

02:43.414 --> 02:46.417
and I'm gonna make him think
that it's his idea.

02:46.417 --> 02:49.587
I know Sang can be...
conceited, vain...

02:49.587 --> 02:50.963
- Yes.
- immature, narcissistic,

02:50.963 --> 02:53.549
but he's not a bad person.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.593
Eh, he's sort of a bad person.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.849
No!

03:18.324 --> 03:20.159
I want my mommy.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.980
Did you come
to bed yet?

04:30.980 --> 04:34.984
Yeah, twice. But I think
I'm gonna go for a run.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.654
Be safe.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.715
Clear. Gunslinger 28.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.259
What's your location?
Where the fuck are you?

05:00.259 --> 05:01.885
I'm right behind you.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.638
What the fuck.

05:06.849 --> 05:10.019
Yo, is anyone gonna
waste this motherfucker?

06:02.571 --> 06:04.281
- What are you doing?
- Fuck, Craig!

06:04.281 --> 06:07.493
Oh! You almost gave me
a heart attack.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.328
What is that?

06:09.328 --> 06:10.788
- What?
- What... the thing

06:10.788 --> 06:12.873
that you're putting...
Is that, uh...

06:12.873 --> 06:16.752
- Is that a camera?
- What? You're paranoid.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.879
Okay, then show it to me.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.549
- Okay, it's a camera.
- What the fuck?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.468
What are you doing
filming in here?

06:24.468 --> 06:27.554
It was Sang's idea,
ever since the lawsuit,

06:27.554 --> 06:30.933
- he was paranoid.
- Okay, where else?

06:30.933 --> 06:32.893
Where else are all the cameras?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.899
I'm just getting started.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.527
Oh, this fucking place.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.989
What are you doing here?

06:45.989 --> 06:48.033
I can't sleep.
I was just...

06:48.033 --> 06:50.035
I think I left some weed here.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.413
Ah!

06:54.832 --> 06:56.375
Huzzah.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.210
You wanna share some of that?

07:06.677 --> 07:08.637
So, you found
something else yet?

07:08.637 --> 07:11.974
Yeah, looks like
I'm going to Lobster.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.517
They're putting
together an offer.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.936
- Oh.
- You?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.480
I'm just taking some time.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.983
Don't take too long,
it's cold out there.

07:23.986 --> 07:27.489
So, uh, what does Patti
think you should do?

07:27.489 --> 07:29.199
You guys are still--

07:29.199 --> 07:33.078
Yeah, she thinks that I should,
uh, pray for my soul

07:33.078 --> 07:35.289
and change my career.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.417
- She never said that.
- Eh...

07:38.417 --> 07:40.419
Not in the same breath.

07:43.547 --> 07:47.217
Hey, Elaine, you ever
think about how...

07:47.217 --> 07:49.845
...if the devil made him do it,

07:49.845 --> 07:53.056
then, like, what does that
make us?

08:00.230 --> 08:03.442
Cigarettes make you cough.

08:03.442 --> 08:06.695
Coke rots your teeth.

08:06.695 --> 08:08.322
TV makes you stupid.

08:10.073 --> 08:13.285
You've been playing video games
your whole life, right?

08:13.285 --> 08:15.871
Yeah, since I had thumbs.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.707
And did you ever go
on a killing spree?

08:18.707 --> 08:20.918
Did I ever go on
a killing spree?

08:20.918 --> 08:22.711
No, not yet.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.588
But, I, uh, you know...

08:24.588 --> 08:27.007
I'm not 30 yet, so who knows.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.597
- Didn't you lock up?
- I thought I did.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.951
Hello.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.285
Can I help you?

08:59.456 --> 09:01.792
Mr. Sang-woo, please.

09:04.795 --> 09:06.421
Sang isn't available.

09:06.421 --> 09:10.968
Is there someone else
I can direct you to?

09:10.968 --> 09:13.679
Oh, that's right, he killed
those children

09:13.679 --> 09:17.599
and then turned
the gun on himself.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.852
- I didn't get your name.
- Regus Patoff.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.021
Mr. Patoff, he actually didn't
kill any children.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.524
Some children killed him...
or one child shot him.

09:25.524 --> 09:27.442
It was a psychotic break
caused by...

09:27.442 --> 09:29.111
They don't know what
caused it.

09:29.111 --> 09:31.280
- We don't know what caused it.
- You're right.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.906
I told myself
that other version

09:32.906 --> 09:36.201
and it sounded so incredible,
it must have stuck in my mind.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.331
Do you mind?

09:41.331 --> 09:43.750
Uh... sure.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.882
- I'm not very good on stairs.
- Okay.

09:54.886 --> 09:58.432
I'm sorry, sir, can I just ask,
where do you think you're going?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.726
To work.

10:00.726 --> 10:04.104
I trust Mr. Sang was
true to his word

10:04.104 --> 10:07.316
and made an appropriate
arrangement.

10:07.316 --> 10:10.110
My contract isn't starting
until the morning,

10:10.110 --> 10:14.156
but it sets a very good example
to be the first one to arrive.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.658
What did Sang hire you
to do, Mister, uh...

10:16.658 --> 10:18.243
Patoff.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.413
Patoff.
Is that, uh, Russian?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.832
It's Crimean Peninsula.

10:23.832 --> 10:27.794
I am to consult Mr. Sang
on all matters of business.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.255
Specifically, corporate
structure?

10:30.255 --> 10:31.965
Productivity?
Branding?

10:31.965 --> 10:34.009
On all matters of business.

10:36.219 --> 10:39.139
Oh, it doesn't look so
high from down there.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.058
Yeah, there is
a service elevator,

10:41.058 --> 10:43.894
but we're more than
halfway up, so, maybe...

10:45.312 --> 10:48.231
Well, then, logic
dictates we proceed.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.456
Thank you.

11:04.456 --> 11:08.085
I can carry myself from here.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.378
Sir, sir!

11:09.378 --> 11:11.546
You can't go in there. Sir!

11:11.546 --> 11:13.340
Sir! That's...

11:17.219 --> 11:19.888
Yeah, this will do.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.474
Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.975
It's vacant.

11:26.561 --> 11:30.357
Mr. Patoff, I'm sorry if you've
had a wasted journey.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.735
Take a look around, there's no
business left to consult on.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.237
We're totally shuttered.

11:43.412 --> 11:49.543
I wish to call a full staff
meeting for tomorrow morning.

11:49.543 --> 11:52.045
Shall we say, 9 AM?

11:55.924 --> 11:58.802
And you'll find this...

12:00.804 --> 12:03.640
...illustrates
Mr. Sang's wishes.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.521
What does it say?

12:12.274 --> 12:14.317
Who owns us?

12:14.317 --> 12:16.987
When the lawyers are done,
Sang's only living relative,

12:16.987 --> 12:19.990
his mother, who lives in Busan
and speaks no English.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.785
Fuck, why did you let me
get high?

12:23.785 --> 12:27.164
It's what he says. He's here to
consult directly with Sang

12:27.164 --> 12:29.833
on all matters relating
to CompWare.

12:29.833 --> 12:32.836
Okay, so in the absence of Sang,
who's in charge here?

12:32.836 --> 12:34.754
Mr. Can't Get Up
the Fucking Stairs?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.214
Why are you asking me?

12:36.214 --> 12:37.299
You were Sang's assistant.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.176
Creative liaison.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.470
Creative liaison?

12:41.470 --> 12:43.972
- I gave myself a title bump.
- When?

12:43.972 --> 12:45.932
When I started applying
for other jobs.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.935
You don't know what it's like
out there. You don't try.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.021
Well, maybe you should
make yourself CEO,

12:51.021 --> 12:53.899
'cause apparently right now
we do not have one.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.457
Did you smoke weed last night?

13:13.168 --> 13:14.419
No.

13:14.419 --> 13:17.631
The bedding stinks.
I'm not nagging,

13:17.631 --> 13:20.717
but could you maybe
do a wash for me, please?

13:20.717 --> 13:23.428
- What time is it?
- It's 8:30. I gotta go.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.139
But will you be around later
to sign for something?

13:26.139 --> 13:29.434
- Wait, I have to go to work.
- No, honey. You don't.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.395
Ah, there's this guy, Patoff.
He's a consultant.

13:32.395 --> 13:35.315
Sang hired him.
Everybody has to go in.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.527
If you strip 'em, I'll wash 'em.
Love you.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.487
- Love you.
- Love you.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.500
Yo. Is he here?

13:53.500 --> 13:56.419
I don't know.
I don't think he left.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.881
Shouldn't someone
talk to legal?

13:59.881 --> 14:03.510
I already did. Unless they shut
us down or sell us off,

14:03.510 --> 14:06.263
everything sanctioned by Sang
is in play.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.153
Good morning, comrades.

14:24.739 --> 14:28.076
Unfortunately, Mr. Sang cannot
be with us today,

14:28.076 --> 14:30.287
but he sends his best regards.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.084
To the wonderful faces
I see below,

14:36.084 --> 14:40.714
thank you for being an important
part in CompWare's success.

14:40.714 --> 14:44.217
I'm looking forward to getting
to know you all personally.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.429
You are valued.

14:48.763 --> 14:53.476
Uh, and for those
who work remotely,

14:53.476 --> 14:56.855
you have exactly one hour
to get here in person

14:56.855 --> 14:59.858
or your contracts of employment
will be terminated.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.408
That's all.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.162
My God.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.706
Can he do that?

15:14.706 --> 15:16.708
He seems to think so.

15:26.176 --> 15:28.678
Dude, what happened
to Spin Diesel?

15:28.678 --> 15:29.971
Dude.

15:29.971 --> 15:34.643
This place is a fucking
death factory.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.645
Yo, so,
who's the suit?

15:36.645 --> 15:39.648
His name is Patoff.
That's all we know.

15:47.238 --> 15:50.200
Hi, Elaine Hayman for
Diane Delaney.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.412
Is she contactable?

15:56.122 --> 15:59.542
Yes, I'm just following up on
a position that we dis...

16:03.963 --> 16:07.676
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I understand. Things come up.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.680
Okay.

16:21.856 --> 16:24.609
Is there anything I can help you
with, Mr. Patoff?

16:24.609 --> 16:26.027
What do we make?

16:26.027 --> 16:28.655
- Make?
- The thing we sell?

16:30.824 --> 16:33.785
We produce games.
For your phone.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.662
People pay
for these games?

16:37.038 --> 16:38.665
No, not directly.

16:38.665 --> 16:44.421
They pay through advertising,
in-app purchases, merch.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.882
I'm surprised Sang didn't
explain this

16:47.882 --> 16:49.634
when he engaged
your services.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.345
It's pretty much all he did
in his short life.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.849
No, Mr. Sang and I discussed
wider concepts, but...

16:55.849 --> 16:57.517
Such as?

17:01.104 --> 17:05.150
There it is again.
Do you smell that?

17:05.150 --> 17:07.652
I...
I don't smell anything.

17:07.652 --> 17:13.408
It's like putrid fruit or
decaying flowers.

17:13.408 --> 17:14.868
I can, um...

17:18.121 --> 17:20.081
No, it's not you.

17:24.085 --> 17:26.504
Ah, 10 o'clock exactly!

17:30.675 --> 17:34.971
It's an, an entirely different
prospect going down, isn't it?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.057
Can I show you the elevator?

17:53.031 --> 17:54.449
Let her in.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.534
I gave them all one hour.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.037
She's right there.
If you just open the...

17:59.037 --> 18:01.706
Why should I make an exception
for her?

18:01.706 --> 18:04.125
What's different about this
employee from the others?

18:10.465 --> 18:11.966
Nothing.

18:11.966 --> 18:14.636
It's not as if she didn't
have transportation.

18:20.642 --> 18:22.060
I'm sorry.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.289
He doesn't even know
what we do here.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.000
You check your account this
morning? We all got paid.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.169
Did you hear
what he did to Lois?

18:48.169 --> 18:51.005
Wheelchair Lois
or cleft palate Lois?

18:51.005 --> 18:54.926
I don't know who the fuck
he thinks he is.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.886
I've been looking
into that.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.638
And?

18:58.638 --> 19:01.516
- And we'll talk at lunch.
- I want to talk now.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.726
Did you get rid of all
the cameras?

19:03.726 --> 19:04.727
- Not yet.
- Okay.

19:04.727 --> 19:06.646
So maybe we should talk
at lunch.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.647
Fine.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.572
He doesn't exist.

19:15.572 --> 19:18.032
There is sweet fuck-all out
there about Regus Patoff,

19:18.032 --> 19:20.326
or his so-called consultancy
firm. Hi. How's it going?

19:20.326 --> 19:24.414
Can I get the corn with no salt?
It's ok if you cook it in salt,

19:24.414 --> 19:27.000
but can I just get none of
the salt on the top?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.293
- Yep. Your name?
- Thanks. Craig.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.837
It doesn't stack up.
We were doing really well.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.299
We were in a bit of debt, but
Sang bought a shit-ton of toys.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.301
I don't know why he'd bring
in a grandpa.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.385
- Next.
- Cheese quesadilla.

19:37.385 --> 19:38.511
No conditions.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.846
- Name, please.
- Elaine.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.015
What if he's more than just
a consultant?

19:42.015 --> 19:45.351
Like, a guru? Sang would never
fall for that kind of shit.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.978
They don't give you
a choice.

19:46.978 --> 19:50.106
They worm their way in with
the top CEOs before you know it,

19:50.106 --> 19:52.275
their mission statement's being
translated into fucking Klingon.

19:52.275 --> 19:53.651
They're all parasites.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.820
Sang would never fall for any
of that kinda stuff.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.405
He didn't have friends.

19:57.405 --> 20:00.325
He didn't have any hobbies.
He didn't get laid.

20:00.325 --> 20:04.454
I know you hated him but he was
actually quite pathetic.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.080
Craig, Elaine?

20:06.080 --> 20:08.541
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.920
Ok, so you're saying this guy
just waltzed in off the street

20:11.920 --> 20:15.465
one day and then just got Sang
to sign over complete authority?

20:15.465 --> 20:16.549
I don't buy it.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.509
Are you saying
the contract is fake?

20:18.509 --> 20:21.304
- What's the date on it?
- Why?

20:21.304 --> 20:24.599
Well, if they signed
in person,

20:24.599 --> 20:26.976
then maybe Patoff came
to visit the office.

20:26.976 --> 20:30.146
We have everything recorded.

20:30.146 --> 20:32.899
Sang kept everything
on the server.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.526
Can we look at that?

20:35.526 --> 20:38.237
Yeah,
we just need the date.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.742
Hello, I'm Mr. Regus Patoff.

20:51.334 --> 20:53.503
Hello, I'm Mr. Regus Patoff.

20:53.503 --> 20:54.629
Chanel.

21:19.529 --> 21:22.156
Hello, I'm Mr. Regus Patoff.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.091
March 24th.

21:47.682 --> 21:50.852
Hello, I'm Mr. Regus Patoff.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.662
- Viktor Kulzer.
- Hello.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.719
Our-- our cleaning service
is the worst.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.471
I called and complained,

22:26.471 --> 22:29.599
and apparently they are not
authorized to remove blood.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.857
If it offends you so greatly,
I suggest you acquire

22:37.857 --> 22:42.070
a sponge and a bucket
with warm, soapy water.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.823
I'll get right on that.

22:49.327 --> 22:52.497
Oh. You'd be pleased to know...

22:52.497 --> 22:54.791
...I identified it,

22:54.791 --> 22:57.627
and have taken measures
to eradicate it.

22:59.962 --> 23:03.925
- What's that?
- That rancid smell out there.

23:03.925 --> 23:06.594
Won't be bothering us
any longer.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.349
- That's a relief.
- Yeah.

23:29.200 --> 23:33.538
March 24th. I was back East with
my sister all that week.

23:33.538 --> 23:36.249
Dana was handling
all of his appointments.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.002
Is that live?

23:40.002 --> 23:42.171
If you ever tell anyone
I did this...

23:42.171 --> 23:43.256
I'm not telling anybody.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.425
Right. It's archived,
it'll take a minute.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.094
Where you going?
You aren't helping?

23:48.094 --> 23:50.346
I thought we could
play the back nine

23:50.346 --> 23:52.348
for some Sour Patch
while we wait.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.517
I've gotta go clean up
a spill first,

23:54.517 --> 23:57.103
- but save me the green ones.
- You got it.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.662
Psst. Hey.

24:14.662 --> 24:18.249
- Oh.
- What happened?

24:18.249 --> 24:20.793
He's firing Iain.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.962
Says he doesn't like
the way he smells.

24:22.962 --> 24:27.341
It's constructed humiliation.
Who put this guy in charge?

24:27.341 --> 24:29.302
Sang... we think.

24:29.302 --> 24:32.013
Well, Iain relies
on this job.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.931
You know he can't survive
out there.

24:36.475 --> 24:39.103
- Let me see what I can do.
- Okay.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.860
In.

24:50.865 --> 24:53.993
I can do this later
if you're busy.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.912
No, you can work around me.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.918
Whoever would have thought

25:01.918 --> 25:04.503
pressing a repetitive
sequence of buttons

25:04.503 --> 25:07.798
could hypnotize a young mind
into murder.

25:07.798 --> 25:11.802
They still don't know what
made him do it.

25:11.802 --> 25:15.139
To think you could train an army
of soldiers from their beds.

25:15.139 --> 25:17.350
And when you're ready...

25:17.350 --> 25:20.978
Actually, gaming has been proven
to increase memory,

25:20.978 --> 25:24.815
focus concentration, and enhance
problem-solving abilities.

25:26.651 --> 25:30.529
In some instances,
it can benefit social skills.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.491
I picked up a baby's bottle.

25:33.491 --> 25:37.828
Do I feed the baby or restore
my own health?

25:37.828 --> 25:40.623
Well, if you wanna beat
the game...

25:42.625 --> 25:46.045
...eventually you'll have to
sacrifice the baby.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.973
Look, I know everyone's
pretty fucking grateful to

25:56.973 --> 25:59.976
be getting paid right now, but
that doesn't give you license

25:59.976 --> 26:02.687
to fire people who are five
seconds outside of curfew

26:02.687 --> 26:04.855
or because of the way
that they smell.

26:04.855 --> 26:10.027
My purpose is to improve
the business for Mr. Sang.

26:10.027 --> 26:12.196
Yes, but Sang's gone.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.573
What's left of him
is in my bucket.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.788
You liked him.

26:24.709 --> 26:27.253
I felt sorry for him.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.839
I think he had too much
too young,

26:29.839 --> 26:32.508
and he wasn't the genius
everybody said he was.

26:32.508 --> 26:35.219
It's rude of me,
but I am yet to ask.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.346
What do you do here?

26:37.346 --> 26:40.558
I was Sang's...

26:40.558 --> 26:43.602
I was Sang's creative liaison.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.604
Now that's a position of
responsibility?

26:46.856 --> 26:48.983
Sang could always rely on me.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.614
Then I'll leave
the matter to you.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.993
And if I smell him again,
you're both fired.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.931
Hello, I'm Mr. Regus Patoff.

28:15.528 --> 28:17.029
Motherfucker.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.754
Sang made him wait in
reception for 56 minutes.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.923
That means he didn't
have an appointment.

28:35.923 --> 28:38.092
Exactly. Is there any audio?

28:38.092 --> 28:40.344
Not in here.
Sang only wanted to know

28:40.344 --> 28:42.930
if the cleaners
were stealing his candy.

30:11.894 --> 30:13.562
That's it?

30:13.562 --> 30:16.899
14-minute conversation
and he gets this guy to sign?

30:16.899 --> 30:20.027
That is one charming
motherfucker.

30:20.027 --> 30:24.949
Have you, uh, ever heard
of Viktor Kulzer?

30:24.949 --> 30:29.161
Hilltech Industries? They make
artificial limbs in Moscow.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.789
You don't want to work
in Moscow.

30:31.789 --> 30:35.584
Well, their CEO signed
the same contract as Sang,

30:35.584 --> 30:39.255
and he was found decapitated in
his apartment two weeks later.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.283
Was Sang...

31:08.659 --> 31:10.286
Asexual.
