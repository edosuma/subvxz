00:26.504 --> 00:28.550
<i>I played
with a very good friend of mine.</i>

00:29.420 --> 00:31.944
<i>He and I used to pretend
like we were playing</i>

00:32.119 --> 00:34.556
<i>against eight other guys
and we played with anything</i>

00:34.730 --> 00:36.819
<i>that we could to pretend
like it was a baseball</i>

00:36.993 --> 00:38.342
<i>and we used broomsticks.</i>

00:39.561 --> 00:41.693
<i>I don't know
that you would call it baseball.</i>

00:41.867 --> 00:44.044
<i>But we did
the best we could.</i>

00:48.091 --> 00:51.007
<i>A baseball is round,
the bat's the same, you know?</i>

00:51.660 --> 00:53.270
<i>If you have talent,
no matter what color you are,</i>

00:53.444 --> 00:55.229
<i>and if you can play,
you can play.</i>

00:57.144 --> 00:59.885
<i>Baseball is the greatest game
that's ever been invented.</i>

01:02.932 --> 01:04.150
<i>I think
there's always been</i>

01:04.325 --> 01:06.022
<i>in African American life</i>

01:06.196 --> 01:10.113
<i>a real appreciation
of improvisation.</i>

01:11.158 --> 01:14.465
<i>You figured out other ways
of being able to succeed.</i>

01:15.031 --> 01:19.470
<i>And a perfect example of that
is what they did with baseball.</i>

01:20.645 --> 01:22.778
<i>And that's the story
really of the Negro Leagues.</i>

01:42.667 --> 01:44.191
"Prince" Joe: <i>I hear
Black people talking</i>

01:44.365 --> 01:45.975
<i>about church,
I talk about the Negro Leagues.</i>

01:46.454 --> 01:49.370
<i>So much depth.
You had all kind of stars.</i>

01:49.979 --> 01:51.763
<i>There was a camaraderie, man.</i>

01:52.547 --> 01:54.592
<i>You finished playing
a baseball game?</i>

01:55.027 --> 01:57.334
<i>And, man, you go
to the nice places</i>

01:57.508 --> 01:58.988
<i>within the Black community,</i>

01:59.206 --> 02:00.946
<i>and all of your people
were there.</i>

02:01.425 --> 02:03.079
<i>They're so loving, you know?</i>

02:03.732 --> 02:04.733
<i>Greatest thing
that ever happened</i>

02:04.907 --> 02:05.821
<i>to me in my life.</i>

02:07.910 --> 02:10.173
<i>Negroes didn't play ball
'cause they were making money.</i>

02:10.739 --> 02:13.742
<i>They played the ballgame
because they loved to play it.</i>

02:17.441 --> 02:19.400
<i>The Negro Leagues,
I think is a story</i>

02:19.574 --> 02:23.969
<i>about what Black Americans
were able to achieve</i>

02:24.231 --> 02:26.842
at a time when they only had
themselves to rely on.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.845
<i>They are a proud
bunch of men</i>

02:30.237 --> 02:32.500
<i>who play
between the white foul lines.</i>

02:33.109 --> 02:36.156
<i>They accepted their role
as a part of a movement</i>

02:36.460 --> 02:39.028
before we coined the term
"Civil Rights Movement."

02:40.682 --> 02:42.205
Bob K: <i>To go
to a Negro Leagues game,</i>

02:42.379 --> 02:44.381
<i>you could feel the immense pride</i>

02:45.208 --> 02:47.863
<i>that Black folks had
about this product</i>

02:48.037 --> 02:49.299
<i>known as the Negro Leagues.</i>

02:50.170 --> 02:52.563
<i>To a large degree
because they understood</i>

02:52.737 --> 02:56.088
<i>that it was something
that was inherently ours.</i>

02:56.263 --> 02:58.134
Now, it was shared
with the rest of the world,

02:58.787 --> 03:00.136
but it was still ours.

03:00.441 --> 03:01.964
The stories

03:02.182 --> 03:04.488

Baseball League</i>

03:05.010 --> 03:07.404

03:07.926 --> 03:09.798
People would say,
"Did you hear about the League?"

03:09.972 --> 03:11.974
And you always knew

04:35.623 --> 04:37.625
<i>but the great ballplayers
of the leagues</i>

04:38.060 --> 04:39.757
<i>would transform the game.</i>

04:40.932 --> 04:43.544
<i>Jackie Robinson

<i>as the first professional
African American ballplayer</i>

<i>to play in the Major Leagues.</i>

04:52.335 --> 04:54.076
<i>Well,
we know that in 1884,</i>

04:54.337 --> 04:56.165
<i>Moses Fleetwood Walker</i>

04:56.339 --> 05:00.212
<i>played for a professional team,
the Toledo Blue Stockings.</i>

05:00.648 --> 05:04.782
So there were African American
professional ballplayers

05:04.956 --> 05:07.045
in the 19th century.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.135
<i>African Americans
have been playing baseball</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:13.617
<i>for as long as White people
have been playing baseball.</i>

05:14.488 --> 05:17.882
As the sport began
to take hold in popularity,

05:18.056 --> 05:21.756
post-Civil War,
Black people were there always.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.585
<i>There were organized
Black teams,</i>

05:24.759 --> 05:26.238
<i>and they barnstormed.</i>

05:26.413 --> 05:27.936
<i>They played
against other Black teams.</i>

05:28.110 --> 05:30.025
<i>They played against White teams.</i>

05:30.808 --> 05:33.507
<i>There were Blacks
who did play</i>

05:34.072 --> 05:38.033
<i>with Whites on teams.
But the team was majority White,</i>

05:38.207 --> 05:40.296
<i>it may have one
or two Black players on it</i>

05:41.079 --> 05:42.994
<i>and that seemed to be something
that was more acceptable</i>

05:43.168 --> 05:44.953
<i>to the White paying public.</i>

05:45.257 --> 05:46.911
<i>If they only have one
or two Black players</i>

05:47.085 --> 05:48.304
as opposed to a team

05:48.478 --> 05:50.001
that might have
majority Black players

05:50.175 --> 05:51.307
and one or two White players.

05:53.396 --> 05:56.094
<i>But as we move forward
through history,</i>

05:56.399 --> 05:59.968
<i>we see that segregation
starts to tighten its hold.</i>

06:01.926 --> 06:03.711
<i>In 1887,</i>

06:04.059 --> 06:06.714
<i>the character named
Adrian "Cap" Anson</i>

06:06.888 --> 06:08.455
<i>who's up in the Hall of Fame
right now,</i>

06:08.629 --> 06:10.718
<i>one of the fathers
of professional baseball,</i>

06:10.892 --> 06:12.807
<i>is scheduled to play in Newark</i>

06:13.155 --> 06:14.765
against
the Newark Little Giants.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.245
Anson is a racist.

06:16.419 --> 06:17.942
There's no question
he's a racist

06:18.334 --> 06:20.380
<i>because two Black players,</i>

06:20.554 --> 06:22.817
<i>one of them named George Stovey,
a pitcher,</i>

06:22.991 --> 06:25.254
<i>and the other
Moses Fleetwood Walker.</i>

06:26.255 --> 06:27.909
Anson sends word ahead,

06:28.083 --> 06:30.433
"If those two so-and-so's..."

06:30.651 --> 06:33.436
and he uses a word stronger
than "so-and-so's,"

06:33.741 --> 06:35.960
"...are seen on
the field of play,

06:36.744 --> 06:38.354
my team is not gonna play."

06:41.183 --> 06:43.577
<i>Cap Anson, at the time,
is really popular,</i>

06:43.751 --> 06:47.058
<i>and the idea that Cap Anson
could potentially represent</i>

06:47.232 --> 06:50.018
<i>the beliefs and ideals
of White people</i>

06:50.192 --> 06:53.064
<i>throughout baseball,
throughout America in general,</i>

06:53.369 --> 06:54.631
<i>is something
that these executives</i>

06:54.805 --> 06:56.024
<i>really pay attention to.</i>

06:56.198 --> 06:58.374
So when he says
that he's not willing

06:58.548 --> 07:00.245
to take the field
with Black players,

07:00.420 --> 07:01.421
they're like, "Okay."

07:02.204 --> 07:03.945
<i>The International
League directors</i>

07:04.119 --> 07:06.513
<i>held a secret meeting
at the Genesee House yesterday,</i>

07:06.687 --> 07:08.036
<i>and the question
of Colored players</i>

07:08.210 --> 07:09.472
<i>was freely discussed.</i>

07:10.821 --> 07:12.606
<i>Many of the best players
in the League are anxious</i>

07:12.780 --> 07:14.738
<i>to leave on account
of the Colored element,</i>

07:15.347 --> 07:18.655
<i>and the board finally directed
Secretary White to approve</i>

07:18.829 --> 07:21.397
<i>of no more contracts
with Colored men.</i>

07:23.312 --> 07:26.837
<i>African American
ballplayers were very good</i>

07:27.011 --> 07:28.926
<i>at this game,
and they were so good</i>

07:29.100 --> 07:31.102
<i>at the game
that the fear was that,</i>

07:31.451 --> 07:33.670
you know,
they would consume the positions

07:33.844 --> 07:36.412
<i>that White players
were vying for.</i>

07:38.414 --> 07:39.850
<i>In 1896, we have</i>

07:40.024 --> 07:42.549
<i>the Plessy
versus Ferguson decision</i>

07:42.853 --> 07:45.769
<i>that determines
that separate is equal.</i>

07:46.161 --> 07:48.511
<i>Now, it's not, and we know that.</i>

07:48.685 --> 07:51.122
<i>And so, it sets up, essentially,</i>

07:51.296 --> 07:53.951
<i>what we have going well
into the 20th century,</i>

07:54.169 --> 07:56.258
<i>which is this legal doctrine
that says,</i>

07:56.476 --> 07:58.782
<i>"It is okay
to keep everyone separate."</i>

07:59.391 --> 08:03.308
What was happening there
is that a hand goes up

08:03.483 --> 08:06.703
with a stop sign on it,
and it's saying to Blacks

08:06.921 --> 08:10.054
<i>outside of baseball,
but also inside of baseball,</i>

08:10.228 --> 08:12.492
<i>"You can't do this.
You can't do that.</i>

08:12.666 --> 08:15.103
<i>You can't go here.
You can't be this."</i>

08:17.801 --> 08:21.544
<i>Well, what do you do
when that comes at you?</i>

08:23.285 --> 08:25.374
<i>You turn
back into yourself.</i>

08:25.809 --> 08:28.072
<i>You find resources
that are your own resources,</i>

08:28.508 --> 08:31.380
<i>and you establish things
for yourself</i>

08:31.598 --> 08:33.556
<i>that the larger world is saying
you can't do,</i>

08:33.730 --> 08:34.948
<i>et cetera, et cetera.</i>

08:36.907 --> 08:38.212
<i>Really all over the country</i>

08:38.386 --> 08:40.041
<i>Black people
were coming together</i>

08:40.215 --> 08:43.784
<i>and forming these
self-sustaining communities.</i>

08:43.957 --> 08:46.830
It's okay if they never fully
bring us into society.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.005
We can do it ourselves.

08:49.050 --> 08:53.184
<i>We enjoyed ourselves
because we were by ourselves.</i>

08:53.358 --> 08:55.578
<i>And nobody trying to tell us
what to do.</i>

08:55.926 --> 08:59.147
<i>So we learn how to do
with what we had.</i>

08:59.800 --> 09:02.759
<i>See, what do old ladies say?
"Got to use what you got"?</i>

09:03.412 --> 09:05.109
<i>So we had to use what we had.</i>

09:05.632 --> 09:07.764
<i>So Black businesses
come into being</i>

09:07.938 --> 09:09.374
<i>in that period of time,</i>

09:09.766 --> 09:12.334
<i>founded for themselves
out of their own resources,</i>

09:12.508 --> 09:15.990
<i>Black schools and baseball too.</i>

09:17.034 --> 09:19.515
<i>After the Plessy versus Ferguson decision,</i>

09:19.689 --> 09:23.911
<i>great Black professional
baseball teams come into being,</i>

09:24.607 --> 09:29.438
<i>and the players and the games
were ballyhooed by newspapers</i>

09:29.917 --> 09:32.006
<i>that were their own newspapers.</i>

09:32.267 --> 09:34.356
And those newspapers knew

09:34.530 --> 09:36.576
the audience
that they had to play to.

09:40.405 --> 09:42.712
<i>Everybody read
the</i> Chicago Defender

09:43.060 --> 09:44.845
<i>and thePittsburgh Courier...</i>

09:45.019 --> 09:48.457
<i>...the two leading
Black newspapers in the country.</i>

09:48.892 --> 09:51.329
My grandmother,
in our little town,

09:51.721 --> 09:55.029
wouldn't take
the weekly newspaper.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.683
She said it was written

09:56.857 --> 09:58.815
for Whites, by Whites,
and about Whites.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.470
<i>I mean, there were
several major Black newspapers,</i>

10:01.644 --> 10:03.037
<i>and</i> Chicago Defender

10:03.211 --> 10:05.561
<i>was probably the major
Black newspaper.</i>

10:05.779 --> 10:07.171
And lots of people read it.

10:07.345 --> 10:08.651
Lots of Black people read it
in the South.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.785
<i>And the</i> Chicago Defender
<i>was a big promoter</i>

10:11.959 --> 10:14.004
<i>of Black people
moving to the North.</i>

10:16.964 --> 10:18.400
<i>It was a push-pull thing.</i>

10:18.574 --> 10:20.184
<i>You're being attracted
by the possibility</i>

10:20.358 --> 10:22.665
<i>that life could be better
for you moving,</i>

10:22.839 --> 10:25.537
<i>and you want to get away
from a situation that's bad.</i>

10:25.712 --> 10:27.061
<i>So something's pushing you out,</i>

10:27.235 --> 10:28.889
as well as something
is pulling you forward.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.457
Bob M: <i>For Blacks
in the Jim Crow South,</i>

10:32.632 --> 10:33.763
<i>life was a struggle.</i>

10:34.546 --> 10:36.157
<i>Where I grew up in Alabama,</i>

10:36.592 --> 10:38.550
<i>fear and violence
were commonplace.</i>

10:40.465 --> 10:43.904
<i>The Ku Klux Klan always did
its dirty work at night</i>

10:44.078 --> 10:46.210
<i>and would often drive
right past us on the way</i>

10:46.384 --> 10:48.822
<i>to a lynching
or cross-burning ceremony.</i>

10:50.737 --> 10:52.216
Bob M: <i>Mama would shout,</i>

10:52.477 --> 10:54.262
<i>"Y'all kids, hurry up,
and turn off the lights,</i>

10:54.436 --> 10:56.046
<i>and lay down on the floor."</i>

10:56.438 --> 10:59.006
<i>With the house pitch black,
I could hear my heart pounding</i>

10:59.180 --> 11:00.616
<i>with terror as I lay there.</i>

11:01.182 --> 11:02.705
<i>If rifles were shooting
in the air...</i>

11:02.879 --> 11:03.793
<i>...then we knew</i>

11:03.967 --> 11:05.403
<i>some poor Black soul</i>

11:05.577 --> 11:07.362
<i>had been lynched
just over the hill.</i>

11:11.714 --> 11:13.716
<i>My brother had written me
several times,</i>

11:13.890 --> 11:15.936
<i>encouraging me to join him
in the North.</i>

11:16.458 --> 11:17.851
<i>I longed to go.</i>

11:18.503 --> 11:22.159
<i>So on a chilly October day,
I hopped aboard a freight train.</i>

11:23.073 --> 11:24.858
<i>As the train chugged forward,</i>

11:25.032 --> 11:27.077
<i>I could feel the weight
of Southern oppression</i>

11:27.251 --> 11:28.775
<i>lifted off my shoulders,</i>

11:29.123 --> 11:31.560
<i>on our way
to a promised land of jobs,</i>

11:31.734 --> 11:33.257
<i>independence...</i>

11:33.431 --> 11:36.217
<i>...and a better life
for a Colored man in America.</i>

11:37.087 --> 11:38.610
<i>We had a dream.</i>

11:39.481 --> 11:41.178
<i>People felt that</i>

11:41.483 --> 11:44.268
<i>this is a land of opportunity.
Okay, so I will move North,</i>

11:44.616 --> 11:47.054
I will move West, et cetera.

11:47.228 --> 11:52.189
All of these areas where we hope
to find the real America.

11:52.363 --> 11:55.584
<i>America that allows us
to be all we can be,</i>

11:55.976 --> 11:57.412
<i>all we can become.</i>

11:58.239 --> 12:00.937
<i>And it's a flood tide,
that immigration.</i>

12:01.329 --> 12:03.157
<i>Over a million Blacks come up</i>

12:03.331 --> 12:06.464
<i>out of the South to settle in
urban centers in the North.</i>

12:07.857 --> 12:10.817
<i>So it's no surprise
that Black baseball</i>

12:10.991 --> 12:13.994
<i>would develop as Black people
moved out of the South</i>

12:14.211 --> 12:16.387
<i>and into cities
where the segregation</i>

12:16.561 --> 12:20.130
<i>was a little less rigid
and they had transportation</i>

12:20.304 --> 12:22.480
<i>to get people to go
to a ballgame.</i>

12:22.785 --> 12:24.918
<i>These kinds of things
made a huge difference</i>

12:25.092 --> 12:26.484
<i>in making it possible
for Black people</i>

12:26.658 --> 12:28.835
<i>to have an array
of teams in cities.</i>

12:32.099 --> 12:33.883
<i>So now, you see</i>

12:34.492 --> 12:37.887
a few entrepreneurs trying
to make a go of it in baseball.

12:38.453 --> 12:42.805
<i>And people like Rube Foster,
in Chicago, is able to see</i>

12:42.979 --> 12:44.981
<i>that a Black club can be</i>

12:45.199 --> 12:47.201
<i>a successful
business enterprise.</i>

12:50.421 --> 12:54.774
Bob K: <i>Andrew Rube Foster owned
the Chicago American Giants,</i>

12:54.948 --> 12:57.733
and he managed
the Chicago American Giants.

12:58.212 --> 13:01.128
And Rube Foster,
in my own estimation,

13:01.302 --> 13:05.915
is the greatest baseball mind
this sport has ever seen.

13:06.350 --> 13:09.397
Rube Foster was light-years
ahead of his time.

13:10.398 --> 13:12.095
<i>He was better known
as a pitcher,</i>

13:12.400 --> 13:15.969
<i>he pitched seven no-hitters
in his brilliant career.</i>

13:16.360 --> 13:18.667
<i>Quite frankly,
by 1905, he might have been</i>

13:18.841 --> 13:20.930
<i>the greatest pitcher
in the world.</i>

13:21.452 --> 13:23.411
Bob K: <i>He is credited
with having invented</i>

13:23.585 --> 13:26.544
<i>what we now know
to be the screwball.</i>

13:26.980 --> 13:29.025
<i>Back then, it was called
a "fade away,"</i>

13:29.547 --> 13:32.072
and ol' Rube perfected
this pitch.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.162
<i>So much so that the great</i>

13:35.336 --> 13:37.904
<i>Major League manager,
John McGraw,</i>

13:38.469 --> 13:43.648
<i>would sneak Rube into his camp
so that Rube Foster could teach</i>

13:43.866 --> 13:47.043
<i>Christy Mathewson how to throw
the screwball.</i>

13:47.565 --> 13:49.741
<i>Christy Mathewson threw
the pitch all the way</i>

13:49.916 --> 13:52.005
<i>into the National Baseball
Hall of Fame,</i>

13:52.179 --> 13:54.268
<i>that he learned
from Rube Foster.</i>

13:55.791 --> 14:01.057
<i>Rube's greatest asset
was his genius as a manager</i>

14:01.231 --> 14:02.885
<i>and as an executive.</i>

14:03.059 --> 14:05.888
He's the founder
of the Chicago American Giants,

14:06.106 --> 14:10.501
1910 or thereabouts
and through the next decade,

14:10.675 --> 14:13.722
<i>Rube Foster makes that team
into the greatest Black team</i>

14:13.896 --> 14:16.116
<i>up to that point in time
that there was.</i>

14:16.812 --> 14:19.423
<i>Mr. Foster
was a pretty smart dude, now.</i>

14:19.815 --> 14:22.209
You would thought he went
to school somewhere,

14:22.687 --> 14:24.211
but he didn't.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.692
<i>He would go down South
to the Negro colleges in Texas,</i>

14:27.867 --> 14:30.521
<i>and he would get
a lot of the ballplayers</i>

14:30.957 --> 14:32.045
<i>out of the schools.</i>

14:33.046 --> 14:36.353
<i>If he was a fast man,
a good runner, he'd say,</i>

14:36.527 --> 14:39.443
<i>"Would you put on
some football pads?</i>

14:39.835 --> 14:41.184
<i>I want you to learn</i>

14:41.358 --> 14:43.056
<i>how to steal bases."</i>

14:43.230 --> 14:44.753
<i>And Mr. Foster taught
them all the tricks.</i>

14:46.015 --> 14:49.801
He exploited the rules
to his maximum benefit.

14:50.106 --> 14:51.803
<i>We're looking
at a bunt-and-run...</i>

14:51.978 --> 14:53.980
<i>...drag bunting...</i>

14:56.025 --> 14:57.113
<i>double steals...</i>

14:59.028 --> 15:01.465
<i>a suicide squeeze play
at home plate.</i>

15:01.726 --> 15:03.206
<i>He made the game more up tempo.</i>

15:03.772 --> 15:06.383
You see, he was adamant
about the style of play

15:06.949 --> 15:09.909
that would become signature
Negro Leagues Baseball.

15:10.126 --> 15:13.390
<i>Fast, aggressive, daring.</i>

15:13.564 --> 15:14.957
<i>They bunt their way up.</i>

15:15.175 --> 15:17.133
<i>They steal second,
they steal third.</i>

15:17.307 --> 15:19.005
And, man,
if you weren't too smart,

15:19.179 --> 15:20.528
they were stealing home.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.235
<i>During World War I,</i>

15:32.409 --> 15:34.977
<i>W.E.B. Du Bois wrote
a very famous editorial</i>

15:35.151 --> 15:37.110
<i>in the crisis
called "Close Ranks."</i>

15:37.327 --> 15:40.461
<i>He told Black people,
"We need to set aside</i>

15:40.722 --> 15:45.031
<i>our grievances and go join
with the country to go fight</i>

15:45.205 --> 15:46.467
<i>to save democracy."</i>

15:50.601 --> 15:51.820
News reporter: <i>Fighting
with the eighth Illinois</i>

15:52.038 --> 15:53.430
<i>on the Swanson Front...</i>

15:55.302 --> 15:57.652
<i>...372nd on the plains
of Mons-En-Chaussée.</i>

15:59.567 --> 16:01.047
But he thought that doing this,

16:01.221 --> 16:03.049
Black people would show
their loyalty,

16:03.223 --> 16:05.399
<i>and Black people would show
they were American citizens,</i>

16:05.573 --> 16:07.357
<i>and Black people would show
that they were putting</i>

16:07.531 --> 16:08.968
<i>being American</i>

16:09.359 --> 16:11.883
<i>above being Black,
and that this would get them</i>

16:12.058 --> 16:14.147
<i>some degree of acceptance.
This would get them some degree</i>

16:14.321 --> 16:16.714
<i>of White people listening
to their grievances</i>

16:16.888 --> 16:18.107
and responding
to their grievances.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.282
He turned out
to be totally wrong.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.416
<i>What happens is that
they come back</i>

16:22.982 --> 16:26.376
into a racial world
that is terribly negative.

16:26.594 --> 16:30.293
<i>In a couple of instances,
the</i> Chicago Defender <i>prints</i>

16:30.467 --> 16:35.037
<i>a Black soldier in his uniform
being hanged, being lynched.</i>

16:37.866 --> 16:41.261
<i>The Red Summer of 1919
was one of the worst summers</i>

16:41.435 --> 16:44.742
<i>of White terroristic violence
in history of this country.</i>

16:44.916 --> 16:49.399
<i>From the late winter
up until the following fall,</i>

16:49.573 --> 16:52.707
<i>there was violence all over,
and it was, almost all of it</i>

16:52.881 --> 16:55.014
<i>was White violence
against Blacks.</i>

17:11.464 --> 17:13.554
<i>The most noted
was Chicago.</i>

17:13.858 --> 17:16.992
<i>There was also terrible blow up
in Washington, DC,</i>

17:17.165 --> 17:19.690
<i>Wilmington, Delaware,
Elaine, Arkansas.</i>

17:19.864 --> 17:21.257
<i>It happened all over.</i>

17:22.127 --> 17:27.349
And part of it was White people
wanting to tell Black people

17:27.568 --> 17:31.963
the war doesn't change anything,
and we're still in charge.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.968
<i>But it convinced
a lot of Black people,</i>

17:37.317 --> 17:41.408
<i>all the more,
that we need to close ranks</i>

17:41.582 --> 17:44.498
<i>in another kind of way
to build our own institutions.</i>

17:54.682 --> 17:55.683
<i>You had the rise</i>

17:55.857 --> 17:57.293
<i>of someone like Marcus Garvey.</i>

17:57.467 --> 17:59.904
<i>You had people
who were telling Black people,</i>

18:00.079 --> 18:02.385
<i>in essence,
that they had a destiny.</i>

18:02.646 --> 18:04.692
<i>Soon after,
we got Alain Locke writing</i>

18:04.866 --> 18:06.824
<i>his great book called,</i>
The New Negro.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.044
<i>The New Negro had a new voice.</i>

18:09.349 --> 18:11.133
<i>The New Negro was not going</i>

18:11.307 --> 18:15.268
<i>to sit back and accept these
segregated sanctions anymore.</i>

18:15.485 --> 18:17.270
<i>And so we got a new mindset.</i>

18:17.574 --> 18:20.838
This is the perfect time
in America to start

18:21.100 --> 18:23.798
an organized league in 1920.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.541
<i>Rube Foster
certainly has to be aware</i>

18:27.715 --> 18:30.021
<i>of all these people
trying to figure out</i>

18:30.196 --> 18:32.633
how to move Black people forward

18:32.807 --> 18:35.853
in a society that has constantly
ostracized them,

18:36.027 --> 18:37.594
that has kept them
on the margins

18:37.768 --> 18:39.640
and doesn't appear
to be changing.

18:40.162 --> 18:44.949
<i>So Rube Foster wrote
a series of op-eds called,</i>

18:45.124 --> 18:48.388
<i>"The Pitfalls of Baseball"
for the</i> Chicago Defender,

18:48.562 --> 18:50.912
and he talked
about the importance

18:51.086 --> 18:54.133
of organizing Black baseball.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.439
<i>How it would benefit,</i>

18:56.613 --> 18:59.964
<i>not just the players,
but the owners of each team,</i>

19:00.139 --> 19:02.967
<i>for them to form
this connected league</i>

19:03.229 --> 19:06.014
and to have scheduled games
and play against each other

19:06.188 --> 19:08.495
and build a fan base.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.889
<i>"I have fought against
delivering Colored baseball</i>

19:12.063 --> 19:13.543
<i>into the control of Whites,</i>

19:14.065 --> 19:16.590
<i>thinking that with a show
of patronage from the fans</i>

19:16.851 --> 19:18.287
<i>we would get together."</i>

19:20.463 --> 19:24.554
<i>So he gets paperwork
done in the state of Illinois</i>

19:24.728 --> 19:27.078
<i>to incorporate
this non-existent league</i>

19:27.253 --> 19:29.646
<i>that no one has even agreed
to do yet.</i>

19:30.125 --> 19:33.128
And he gets these
other team owners to agree,

19:33.302 --> 19:36.175
<i>and they meet
in Kansas City at the Y.</i>

19:37.872 --> 19:39.917
Bob K: <i>You know,
I wish I could have been</i>

19:40.091 --> 19:42.920
a fly on the wall in that room
because Rube Foster had to be

19:43.094 --> 19:44.357
a master salesman.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.185
He had to be
because he had pulled

19:46.359 --> 19:48.099
<i>these independent
Black baseball team owners.</i>

19:48.274 --> 19:49.884
<i>So they were already
making money.</i>

19:50.058 --> 19:53.235
<i>And now he had to convince them
that they could be</i>

19:53.409 --> 19:57.065
<i>even more successful
if we organize</i>

19:57.370 --> 19:59.937
<i>and we now share
a piece of the pie</i>

20:00.199 --> 20:02.201
<i>by creating our own league.</i>

20:02.897 --> 20:04.986
And so, you know Rube
was a great salesman

20:05.247 --> 20:07.249
because he was able to do that.

20:08.032 --> 20:11.775
<i>And on February 13th, 1920,
they walked out having signed</i>

20:11.949 --> 20:14.256
<i>the documents to start
the Negro National League.</i>

20:16.606 --> 20:18.478
<i>His motto for the League</i>

20:18.826 --> 20:21.002
<i>he stole from abolitionist
Frederick Douglass.</i>

20:21.872 --> 20:23.091
"We are the ship..."

20:23.265 --> 20:24.788
- "...and all else..."
- "...the sea."

20:27.400 --> 20:28.618
Bob K:
<i>Yeah, he was serving notice</i>

20:28.792 --> 20:30.185
<i>to Major League Baseball</i>

20:30.359 --> 20:32.405
<i>that a new player had arrived
on the scene</i>

20:32.579 --> 20:33.797
<i>to be reckoned with.</i>

20:44.721 --> 20:46.288
Bob M: <i>When it came
to promoting a game,</i>

20:46.549 --> 20:49.160
<i>no one did it better
than the Negro Leagues.</i>

20:49.726 --> 20:51.989
<i>Window placards,
newspaper advertisements,</i>

20:52.338 --> 20:53.817
<i>and word-of-mouth
were in the works,</i>

20:53.991 --> 20:56.080
<i>well in advance for most games.</i>

20:57.299 --> 20:59.910
<i>Sometimes I spent the ten cents
to buy a ticket.</i>

21:00.650 --> 21:02.739
<i>Other times,
I'd peer through the knotholes</i>

21:02.913 --> 21:05.176
<i>in the wooden fence
outside the stadium.</i>

21:08.179 --> 21:10.965
<i>Pitchers zipped balls
with such speed across the plate</i>

21:11.226 --> 21:12.880
<i>that it was hard
to follow the pitch.</i>

21:13.968 --> 21:15.491
<i>Batters stretched singles</i>

21:15.665 --> 21:16.971
<i>into doubles,
and doubles into triples,</i>

21:17.188 --> 21:18.451
<i>with lightning speed.</i>

21:19.539 --> 21:21.584
<i>It was obvious the fans
didn't want the celebration</i>

21:21.758 --> 21:23.847
<i>to end, and neither did I.</i>

21:25.501 --> 21:28.591
Negro Leagues baseball
was so popular

21:29.200 --> 21:35.337
that Black churches would move
their service time up an hour

21:36.164 --> 21:37.861
so fans could go to the game.

21:38.253 --> 21:41.648
If you know anything
about the Black church,

21:42.039 --> 21:43.606
you don't mess
with service time.

21:43.824 --> 21:45.652
<i>But when the great Kansas City
Monarchs are playing,</i>

21:45.826 --> 21:47.480
<i>any of those great Black teams,</i>

21:47.828 --> 21:50.439
<i>service time would move up
to ten o'clock,</i>

21:50.657 --> 21:53.529
<i>and everybody filed out
going to that</i>

21:53.703 --> 21:56.140
<i>Sunday doubleheader
looking good.</i>

21:56.880 --> 21:58.621
<i>When they went
to baseball games,</i>

21:58.795 --> 22:01.363
<i>men would dress very sharply.</i>

22:01.755 --> 22:05.628
<i>Ladies wore dresses
and big hats, beautiful hats,</i>

22:06.194 --> 22:08.370
<i>with flowers
and whatnot on them.</i>

22:08.849 --> 22:13.549
<i>You would buy the fanciest
clothing in the world.</i>

22:14.811 --> 22:16.378
<i>The age
of the 20th century,</i>

22:16.552 --> 22:18.946
<i>the Harlem Renaissance,
New Negro Renaissance,</i>

22:19.207 --> 22:21.688
<i>was the age of the rise
of the Black professional.</i>

22:21.862 --> 22:24.299
<i>You know, you got
a new kind of presentation</i>

22:24.473 --> 22:25.953
<i>of the Black
professional musician.</i>

22:26.127 --> 22:27.781
<i>You got a new kind
of presentation</i>

22:28.042 --> 22:29.696
<i>of the Black
professional athlete</i>

22:29.870 --> 22:31.045
<i>with Negro League Baseball.</i>

22:31.654 --> 22:34.875
<i>These were professional men,
sometimes women,</i>

22:35.223 --> 22:38.052
<i>who were doing something
at a very, very high level</i>

22:38.531 --> 22:40.054
<i>and had a tremendous virtuosity.</i>

22:40.271 --> 22:42.230
Any time you saw
Black people doing something

22:42.404 --> 22:45.364
that was virtuosic,
you always... You felt like,

22:45.538 --> 22:47.191
"Okay, I can go on

22:47.366 --> 22:48.845
and deal
with the rest of my week...

22:49.019 --> 22:50.586
...'cause I saw
some Black people doing

22:50.760 --> 22:52.240
something
that's really excellent."

22:58.377 --> 23:00.770
<i>That's a home run
in the right field</i>

23:00.944 --> 23:03.860
<i>into the stands!
First home run of the series!</i>

23:06.036 --> 23:07.603
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

23:08.038 --> 23:10.650
<i>White baseball will soon become
a station-to-station game.</i>

23:11.390 --> 23:15.916
You don't run. You don't steal.
You don't bunt. No hit and run.

23:16.438 --> 23:18.658
<i>You try to hit it out
of the park.</i>

23:19.398 --> 23:23.271
<i>And I think that's a reflection
of Babe Ruth's influence.</i>

23:23.619 --> 23:25.491
<i>But it's, in many ways,
the antithesis</i>

23:25.708 --> 23:27.231
<i>of the Black game.</i>

23:28.102 --> 23:30.104
Bob K: <i>If a guy went
into the hole,</i>

23:30.539 --> 23:33.412
<i>flipped it behind his back,
start the double play...</i>

23:35.109 --> 23:37.241
<i>well, we see that now
every night of the week</i>

23:37.416 --> 23:40.549
<i>as a top-ten highlight
on some network.</i>

23:42.421 --> 23:44.510
<i>Back then, the Major Leaguers
would say</i>

23:44.684 --> 23:46.599
<i>that they were "showboating."</i>

23:47.556 --> 23:49.732
<i>But what the Major Leaguers
were trying to say then</i>

23:49.906 --> 23:51.255
<i>that the Negro Leagues
didn't play the game</i>

23:51.430 --> 23:52.648
<i>the right way.</i>

23:53.301 --> 23:56.826
<i>But really that was a code word
to say they didn't play the game</i>

23:57.044 --> 23:58.306
<i>the White way.</i>

24:03.920 --> 24:06.836
<i>But still,
it was a fabulous time</i>

24:07.228 --> 24:08.838
<i>for Black men in baseball</i>

24:09.012 --> 24:11.450
because coming out
of World War I,

24:11.624 --> 24:14.365
there were lots of people
who were looking

24:14.844 --> 24:16.672
for that equality,
but now they have

24:16.846 --> 24:18.326
their own league.
How about that?

24:19.240 --> 24:23.070
<i>So once Rube Foster organizes
the Negro National League,</i>

24:23.462 --> 24:26.595
<i>other people start to see that,
"Hey, there's a possibility."</i>

24:27.248 --> 24:29.032
<i>1923 rolls around.</i>

24:29.206 --> 24:31.687
<i>There's a guy in Philadelphia
by the name of Ed Bolden,</i>

24:32.209 --> 24:34.168
<i>and he'd worked
for the post office for years.</i>

24:34.342 --> 24:36.823
<i>He was the owner
of the Hilldale team.</i>

24:37.127 --> 24:38.868
He sees the writing on the wall,

24:39.042 --> 24:43.394
that Rube Foster's influence
is headed towards the East.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.571
So Ed Bolden gets

24:45.745 --> 24:48.225
<i>all of the Eastern teams together,</i>

24:48.399 --> 24:49.879
<i>and they have a big meeting,
and they form</i>

24:50.053 --> 24:52.534
<i>the Eastern Colored League
in 1923.</i>

24:55.015 --> 24:57.060
<i>With the creation
of the Eastern Colored League</i>

24:57.234 --> 24:59.585
<i>on the East Coast,
the Negro National League,</i>

24:59.759 --> 25:01.543
<i>that was primarily based
in the Midwest,</i>

25:01.848 --> 25:03.458
<i>has a competitive league</i>

25:03.632 --> 25:05.721
<i>that now they can stage
a World Series against.</i>

25:07.114 --> 25:10.378
<i>So in 1924,
the Kansas City Monarchs</i>

25:10.552 --> 25:13.424
<i>of the Negro National League
played the Hilldale Daisies</i>

25:13.599 --> 25:15.122
<i>of the Eastern Colored League</i>

25:15.296 --> 25:17.037
<i>in the very first
Colored World Series.</i>

25:17.951 --> 25:21.432
<i>The World Series in 1924
was the best of nine,</i>

25:21.998 --> 25:23.609
<i>not seven like it is today.</i>

25:24.740 --> 25:26.699
<i>It turned out to be
a great series.</i>

25:27.047 --> 25:28.744
<i>Series is tied up
four games each.</i>

25:28.918 --> 25:30.050
<i>We're in Chicago now,</i>

25:30.224 --> 25:31.486
the weather is
in the mid-fifties.

25:31.965 --> 25:34.576
<i>José Méndez has a cold,
and Rube Foster says,</i>

25:34.750 --> 25:36.099
<i>"You have to pitch this game."</i>

25:36.447 --> 25:38.493
<i>Hilldale comes out
with Script Lee.</i>

25:38.667 --> 25:40.364
<i>Script Lee
is a submarine pitcher.</i>

25:41.104 --> 25:42.671
<i>The Hilldale pitcher
had everything</i>

25:42.932 --> 25:45.108
<i>a pitcher could ask for
in the first seven innings.</i>

25:46.414 --> 25:49.025
<i>During that time,
only one man reached first.</i>

25:49.591 --> 25:50.897
<i>Then came the eighth.</i>

25:51.550 --> 25:54.030
But he runs out of gas
and he starts to pitch overhand.

25:54.204 --> 25:55.989
<i>The bases were full.</i>

25:56.206 --> 25:58.731
<i>Allen looked over the ball,
then singled to right scoring.</i>

25:58.905 --> 26:00.646
<i>Duncan slid into home plate...</i>

26:00.820 --> 26:03.083
<i>...half a second
ahead of Riggs' throw to Santop.</i>

26:03.344 --> 26:04.954
<i>Monarchs score five runs</i>

26:05.302 --> 26:09.263
and José Méndez, on three hits,
shuts out the Hilldale Club,

26:09.872 --> 26:12.483
<i>and the Monarchs take
the most dramatic World Series</i>

26:12.658 --> 26:13.789
<i>ever played.</i>

26:18.925 --> 26:21.667
It really kind of
established Black baseball.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.539
It was saying to White baseball,
"Look, we're the same.

26:24.713 --> 26:27.673
<i>We have the same end of the year
championship series,</i>

26:27.847 --> 26:29.283
<i>the same way you do.</i>

26:29.457 --> 26:30.937
<i>We've got
our two separate leagues,</i>

26:31.111 --> 26:32.634
<i>like the National
and American League,</i>

26:32.808 --> 26:35.115
<i>the same way you do."
And that was important.</i>

26:35.289 --> 26:39.423
As much as Rube Foster
and other executives wanted to,

26:39.598 --> 26:41.904
you know, get into baseball,
and have successful teams,

26:42.078 --> 26:43.645
so they could make
their own money

26:43.819 --> 26:45.734
and so that they could do this
incredible thing for

26:45.908 --> 26:47.301
and within the Black community.

26:47.475 --> 26:50.086
There was also
this constant effort

26:50.434 --> 26:53.350
to show White baseball
that Black baseball

26:53.524 --> 26:55.788
was good enough,
with the hopes that, ultimately,

26:56.005 --> 26:58.617
Black baseball could become one
with White baseball,

26:58.791 --> 26:59.792
that they could join forces.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.838
Bob K: <i>And Rube's initial vision</i>

27:03.099 --> 27:06.712
<i>was that he would create
a league that was so dynamic,</i>

27:07.103 --> 27:10.933
<i>that he would force Major League
Baseball's hand to expand.</i>

27:11.586 --> 27:15.155
So if we were looking at it
in a more modern-day context,

27:16.025 --> 27:19.899
<i>think football with the NFL
and the AFL merger,</i>

27:20.116 --> 27:22.075
<i>or for those
who are basketball fans,</i>

27:22.249 --> 27:24.817
<i>the merger of the NBA
and the ABA.</i>

27:25.208 --> 27:28.647
<i>Now, this was Rube Foster
in the 1920s.</i>

27:28.864 --> 27:32.651
<i>That's how forward-thinking
and how much a visionary</i>

27:32.825 --> 27:34.391
<i>this man was.</i>

27:38.700 --> 27:41.747
<i>Well, Rube Foster
was in Indianapolis for a game</i>

27:41.921 --> 27:44.401
<i>in May of 1925,</i>

27:45.185 --> 27:46.926
<i>and unfortunately,
he was subjected</i>

27:47.100 --> 27:51.278
<i>to carbon monoxide poisoning
from a leaky gas heater.</i>

27:51.974 --> 27:54.020
<i>Oh, he was rescued
by his teammates</i>

27:54.194 --> 27:57.240
<i>who came to his room
to deliver a telegram.</i>

27:57.937 --> 28:01.810
<i>Some newspaper accounts said
he was in serious condition.</i>

28:02.506 --> 28:03.899
<i>He was rushed to the hospital.</i>

28:04.204 --> 28:06.641
I don't think
he ever fully recovered.

28:06.815 --> 28:09.339
By September
of the following year, in 1926,

28:09.513 --> 28:11.646
he was admitted to a sanitarium.

28:36.105 --> 28:40.066
<i>Rube Foster died
on December the 9th, 1930.</i>

28:42.111 --> 28:44.592
Bob K: <i>And Rube Foster,
when he dies,</i>

28:45.332 --> 28:48.509
<i>the fans of Chicago lined
the streets for three days</i>

28:49.031 --> 28:52.121
<i>to pay their respect
to their beloved Rube Foster.</i>

28:53.601 --> 28:55.429
<i>Thousands of people
came from afar</i>

28:55.603 --> 28:57.561
<i>to celebrate this great legend.</i>

28:58.606 --> 29:00.651
<i>Rube Foster's death
was a great loss</i>

29:00.956 --> 29:02.741
to baseball and Black America.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.527
<i>And the Negro National League</i>

29:06.701 --> 29:08.442
<i>began to struggle.</i>

29:08.921 --> 29:11.750
And then, of course,
not only do they lose Foster,

29:11.924 --> 29:13.534
the Great Depression hits.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.232
And so the combination, I think,
of the two of those things

29:16.406 --> 29:17.843
really brings about the demise

29:18.017 --> 29:19.583
of that first
Negro National League.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.031
<i>As bad
as the Great Depression was</i>

29:32.205 --> 29:35.121
<i>for most White Americans,
it was a heck of a lot worse</i>

29:35.338 --> 29:36.818
<i>for Black Americans.</i>

29:38.037 --> 29:40.604
<i>When it comes
to Blacks, it's the old phrase,</i>

29:40.779 --> 29:43.172
<i>"Last hired, first fired."</i>

29:43.346 --> 29:44.739
That's what faced Blacks.

29:45.609 --> 29:48.221
<i>So the Black community,
which had enjoyed</i>

29:48.395 --> 29:52.486
a certain measure
of economic success in the '20s,

29:52.660 --> 29:55.402
<i>is once again facing hard times.</i>

29:57.752 --> 30:00.537
<i>And that was a bad time
for this country for,</i>

30:00.711 --> 30:02.148
<i>not only the Blacks,</i>

30:02.583 --> 30:05.020
<i>but for the majority
of poor people. It was bad.</i>

30:05.325 --> 30:07.675
I know. They could come
to a baseball game,

30:07.849 --> 30:09.242
forget about all their woes.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.201
And I was just as proud
of making them happy.

30:12.375 --> 30:13.550
And when I'd come in,

30:13.724 --> 30:15.204
you'd think
I had a million dollars.

30:15.683 --> 30:17.859
<i>That's how much baseball
meant to them.</i>

30:22.516 --> 30:24.213
Bob M: <i>All I wanted to do
was talk baseball.</i>

30:26.302 --> 30:27.869
Bob M: <i>The older folks
who hung out at the barbershops</i>

30:28.043 --> 30:29.610
<i>were more than happy to share
their wisdom with me.</i>

30:30.350 --> 30:33.222
<i>Stories of seeing greats
like Oscar Charleston,</i>

30:33.570 --> 30:35.877
<i>"Cool Papa" Bell,
and Josh Gibson.</i>

30:36.486 --> 30:38.662
<i>And legendary teams
like the Pittsburgh Crawfords</i>

30:38.837 --> 30:42.014
<i>and Homestead Grays rolled out
of the mouths of old men</i>

30:42.188 --> 30:44.712
<i>as if they knew
each player personally.</i>

30:46.714 --> 30:49.021
<i>Back in the '30s,
Pittsburgh becomes</i>

30:49.195 --> 30:51.458
<i>the crossroads
of Black baseball in America.</i>

30:52.241 --> 30:55.679
<i>It wasn't the largest
Black community by far,</i>

30:56.332 --> 30:58.639
<i>but it was situated geographically</i>

30:59.161 --> 31:00.989
<i>on the East-West rail lines,</i>

31:01.511 --> 31:03.774
<i>which meant
that any Black intellectual,</i>

31:03.992 --> 31:08.475
politician, figure of note,
or ballclub that's traveling

31:08.649 --> 31:10.956
<i>from New York to Chicago,
or anywhere else,</i>

31:11.130 --> 31:13.045
<i>is going to stop
and play in Pittsburgh.</i>

31:13.697 --> 31:18.354
Pittsburgh becomes the home to,
along with the <i>Chicago Defender,</i>

31:18.572 --> 31:21.662
the most influential
Black newspaper in the country,

31:21.923 --> 31:23.533
<i>the</i> Pittsburgh Courier.

31:23.707 --> 31:25.971
<i>Some of the greatest
jazz musicians of the era</i>

31:26.536 --> 31:28.930
<i>made their fortunes

31:29.148 --> 31:30.801
And in the world of sports,

31:30.976 --> 31:33.195
you have clearly
the two greatest

31:33.369 --> 31:35.806
Negro League dynasties
of the 1930s...

31:37.156 --> 31:39.549
<i>the Homestead Grays
and the Pittsburgh Crawfords.</i>

31:39.767 --> 31:42.074
<i>And those teams had two owners,</i>

31:42.291 --> 31:44.076
<i>who were both
intensely competitive,</i>

31:44.424 --> 31:48.123
<i>Gus Greenlee
and Cumberland Posey Jr.</i>

31:48.645 --> 31:50.430
<i>They were men
of different temperaments.</i>

31:50.821 --> 31:52.301
<i>They had different styles.</i>

31:52.475 --> 31:55.565
I think they knew
that their rivalry was something

31:55.739 --> 31:57.089
that was good for both of them

31:57.263 --> 31:59.308
and good for Black baseball
as a whole.

32:05.619 --> 32:07.751
<i>Cum Posey, who lived
a block and a half from me,</i>

32:08.100 --> 32:10.580
<i>was a great basketball player
at Penn State.</i>

32:11.103 --> 32:12.887
<i>His father was a fairly
well-to-do man,</i>

32:13.061 --> 32:14.628
<i>and so he had the time.</i>

32:14.802 --> 32:18.197
Most Black kids in those days
had worked after school

32:18.371 --> 32:19.938
and on Saturdays and Sundays...

32:20.982 --> 32:22.766
to supplement
your family's income.

32:22.941 --> 32:26.945
But Cum had the time to deal
with a hobby.

32:27.119 --> 32:30.252
<i>And he took some
of these Black baseball players</i>

32:30.426 --> 32:32.167
<i>and made up a team.</i>

32:33.908 --> 32:36.302
<i>It was just
a great experience</i>

32:36.519 --> 32:37.868
<i>to have been in Homestead</i>

32:38.043 --> 32:41.089
at that time and tied in
with that great ballclub

32:41.263 --> 32:42.656
called the Homestead Grays.

34:28.762 --> 34:30.590
<i>every 14 times at bat.</i>

34:31.982 --> 34:33.331
<i>He always led</i>

34:33.505 --> 34:35.159
<i>every league
that he ever played in,</i>

34:35.333 --> 34:36.509
<i>in batting average.</i>

34:36.857 --> 34:40.600
He might go, you know,
get eight for ten,

34:40.774 --> 34:43.994
you know, a 13 for 15.
You know, like that.

34:44.473 --> 34:45.692
Yeah. He was tough to get out.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.520
<i>Griffith Stadium,</i>

34:47.737 --> 34:49.478
<i>there was 405 feet down
the left of the line</i>

34:49.652 --> 34:52.002
<i>and behind that,
there was a scoreboard</i>

34:52.481 --> 34:54.788
<i>that had a big hotdog on it
with mustard on it.</i>

34:55.527 --> 34:58.531
And Josh hit the ball
over the 400 feet,

34:58.705 --> 35:00.185
up over the back
above the stands,

35:00.359 --> 35:02.012
and hit
that advertisement board

35:02.709 --> 35:04.232
<i>and peeled the paper
right off it.</i>

35:04.406 --> 35:05.973
<i>So we used to tease
and say that he knocked</i>

35:06.147 --> 35:07.366
<i>the mustard off the hotdog.</i>

35:07.801 --> 35:09.237
<i>I remember one time</i>

35:09.411 --> 35:11.196
<i>I was walking up the ramp
with Josh,</i>

35:11.718 --> 35:14.199
<i>and one little kid ran up,
said, "Mr. Gibson, Mr. Gibson,</i>

35:14.373 --> 35:16.375
<i>will you give me
one of your broken bats?"</i>

35:16.549 --> 35:17.854
Josh says,

35:18.159 --> 35:20.596
"Son, I don't break bats.
I wear them out."

35:21.684 --> 35:25.340
<i>Now, that Josh Gibson,
he was the type of person</i>

35:25.601 --> 35:27.690
<i>that just liked everybody.</i>

35:28.604 --> 35:31.912
<i>And always with a smile,
like a big overgrown kid.</i>

35:33.087 --> 35:37.483
If I step on the bus, he'd say,
"Why, oh, my, Ms. Posey."

35:37.657 --> 35:40.486
And he'd run
and he'd almost pick me up

35:40.660 --> 35:42.401
and put me in the bus
and everything

35:42.575 --> 35:44.098
he'd see that I had there
and say.

35:44.272 --> 35:46.535
And the first thing he'd say
to the boys is...

35:47.580 --> 35:48.624
And that was it.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.802
Bob K: <i>Cumberland Posey,</i>

35:52.976 --> 35:56.371
<i>of course, had built
the great Homestead Grays,</i>

35:57.111 --> 36:01.420
<i>and Cumberland Posey
had financial wherewithal.</i>

36:01.985 --> 36:04.031
And so he was able to pluck

36:04.205 --> 36:07.817
star players away
from other Black baseball teams.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.559
And he would do
that with regularity.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.649
<i>And then here comes
Gus Greenlee.</i>

36:14.172 --> 36:18.263
<i>Gus Greenlee would build
the great Pittsburgh Crawfords,</i>

36:18.785 --> 36:23.050
<i>as now a rival to Cumberland
Posey's Homestead Grays.</i>

36:24.269 --> 36:25.879
<i>He was in
a lot of businesses.</i>

36:26.184 --> 36:30.188
<i>He ran a very popular restaurant
called Crawford Grill,</i>

36:30.536 --> 36:32.886
and he was the leading entrepreneur

36:33.060 --> 36:35.280
in the Black numbers
gambling business.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.543
<i>Well, the numbers, essentially,</i>

36:37.717 --> 36:39.414
<i>were what we now know
as the lottery.</i>

36:40.154 --> 36:41.808
<i>They would base
the winning number</i>

36:41.982 --> 36:45.028
<i>usually on a number
in the stock tables that day,</i>

36:45.507 --> 36:47.988
and every day,
everybody played the numbers.

36:48.162 --> 36:49.468
My grandmother...

36:49.642 --> 36:51.209
...who, you know,
and my grandparents

36:51.383 --> 36:53.994
who ran a funeral home,
played the numbers every day.

36:55.256 --> 36:58.303
<i>Gus Greenlee was as fine
a man as you would want to know.</i>

36:58.477 --> 37:01.871
And I found that Gus would do
anything for anybody

37:02.045 --> 37:03.699
who was a friend of his.

37:04.526 --> 37:07.007
If he didn't even know them,
and they got in trouble,

37:07.964 --> 37:10.010
if there was anything
he could do to help them

37:10.184 --> 37:12.230
out of trouble, he would do it.

37:15.407 --> 37:16.712
<i>Gus Greenlee was approached</i>

37:16.886 --> 37:18.366
<i>by a couple members</i>

37:18.540 --> 37:20.455
<i>of the Pittsburgh Crawfords
baseball team,</i>

37:20.629 --> 37:23.502
and at the time they were
like a semi-pro sandlot team

37:23.676 --> 37:25.417
and, you know,
said that they needed money,

37:25.591 --> 37:29.072
they needed an investor.
And Gus jumped in headfirst.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.162
<i>When he took
the ball team,</i>

37:32.598 --> 37:36.602
he let us know that when he took
it that he was going to the top

37:36.776 --> 37:39.126
and he's gonna do
and get the best he could.

37:40.040 --> 37:43.739
<i>I think his top motivation
was he looked across town</i>

37:43.913 --> 37:46.742
<i>and he saw Cum Posey,
the son of the biggest</i>

37:46.916 --> 37:49.919
and wealthiest Black family
in town, and said,

37:50.093 --> 37:52.748
"If I can build the Crawfords
into a team

37:53.096 --> 37:54.794
that can beat the Grays,

37:55.273 --> 37:56.970
I'll be the top man
in Pittsburgh."

37:57.971 --> 37:59.886
Bob K: <i>He did
to Cumberland Posey,</i>

38:00.147 --> 38:02.628
what Posey had done
to other teams.

38:02.802 --> 38:06.632
<i>He outbidded Cumberland Posey
for his star players.</i>

38:06.806 --> 38:08.416
<i>He convinces
Oscar Charleston</i>

38:08.590 --> 38:11.201
<i>to cross town
and join the Crawfords.</i>

38:11.463 --> 38:13.073
<i>Then he sets his sight
on Josh Gibson.</i>

38:14.466 --> 38:18.774
<i>So now, Josh Gibson is playing
for the Crawfords.</i>

38:19.732 --> 38:21.821
And so he steals
every good player

38:21.995 --> 38:24.563
that Cumberland Posey
ever developed.

38:25.128 --> 38:27.870
But then the Crawfords are able
to pick up Satchel Paige.

38:32.788 --> 38:36.139
I just could pitch
and then the master just give me

38:36.314 --> 38:39.839
a home. And you just...
It was hard to beat me.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.319
You couldn't ought to beat me.

38:42.885 --> 38:46.628
<i>I did some things in baseball
I've never seen anyone else do,</i>

38:46.802 --> 38:48.369
<i>and I didn't know
what I was doing</i>

38:48.543 --> 38:50.719
<i>one half of the time.
But still, I did it.</i>

38:52.025 --> 38:55.071
<i>Satchel Paige is born
in Mobile, Alabama.</i>

38:55.333 --> 38:56.638
<i>He's dirt poor.</i>

38:56.943 --> 39:00.729
He has to go out
and hunt game with rocks,

39:00.903 --> 39:02.862
<i>and he gets his name, Satchel</i>

39:03.253 --> 39:06.866
<i>because later on,
after he's nine or older,</i>

39:07.257 --> 39:10.435
<i>he's able to work
at the railroad depot</i>

39:10.696 --> 39:13.960
carrying bags, luggage, satchels.

39:14.308 --> 39:15.570
<i>He learned how to pitch</i>

39:15.744 --> 39:18.573
<i>at the Mount Meigs
Reform school.</i>

39:19.313 --> 39:21.881
<i>And so, after that,
he comes out of there</i>

39:22.055 --> 39:25.188
<i>and begins his climb
to baseball fame.</i>

39:26.320 --> 39:28.017
<i>A fellow by the name
of Bill Gatewood,</i>

39:28.191 --> 39:31.151
<i>I just love the way he went,
the way he pitched.</i>

39:31.456 --> 39:34.241
<i>He said, "You know the thing is,
if you listen to me,</i>

39:34.981 --> 39:36.983
<i>I'll make you
one of the greatest pitchers</i>

39:37.462 --> 39:38.376
<i>in the world."</i>

39:39.202 --> 39:40.900
<i>He said,
"Because you love to play,</i>

39:41.074 --> 39:42.380
<i>you love the game,</i>

39:42.771 --> 39:44.599
<i>and you try to do
what I tell you."</i>

39:44.773 --> 39:46.209
<i>He says, "You see
all the fellas out there?"</i>

39:46.514 --> 39:49.299
<i>He says,
"I have the devil with them</i>

39:49.735 --> 39:51.476
<i>trying to make them practice."</i>

39:51.911 --> 39:54.217
<i>He said, "You practice
without me asking you."</i>

39:55.915 --> 39:57.525
<i>So he was gonna help me.</i>

39:57.873 --> 39:59.614
<i>But now, as far as me saying,</i>

39:59.788 --> 40:01.573
<i>"I am the greatest pitcher
in the world."</i>

40:02.095 --> 40:04.402
<i>I didn't say that.
It's other people saying it.</i>

40:06.926 --> 40:08.928
Bob M: <i>Once I became
an umpire in the leagues,</i>

40:09.102 --> 40:11.974
<i>I finally got my shot to go
behind the plate</i>

40:12.148 --> 40:15.064
<i>and call balls
and strikes for the legend.</i>

40:15.848 --> 40:18.372
<i>I had never seen a ball move
the way it did.</i>

40:19.112 --> 40:21.854
<i>I was stunned,
and so was the batter.</i>

40:22.028 --> 40:25.423
Satchel throw balls
that looked small,

40:25.597 --> 40:27.903
throw the small ball,
which is true.

40:28.077 --> 40:29.296
It'd be turning so fast,

40:29.470 --> 40:31.037
it looks smaller
than the regular ball.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.649
"Prince" Joe: <i>I weakly
grounded a ball back to him</i>

40:34.823 --> 40:37.043
and I felt
like I'd hit a home run.

40:37.609 --> 40:40.002
Just to know that I had made
contact with the ball.

40:40.916 --> 40:43.049
<i>Satchel Paige is,
without a doubt,</i>

40:43.266 --> 40:45.530
<i>the greatest pitcher
in Black baseball history.</i>

40:45.921 --> 40:50.230
<i>We can now show Satchel Paige's
strikeout rate per inning</i>

40:50.404 --> 40:52.537
<i>is very similar to Nolan Ryan's.</i>

40:52.711 --> 40:54.277
Bob F: <i>He would be
one of the top five</i>

40:54.452 --> 40:56.149
<i>or ten pitchers
in baseball history</i>

40:56.323 --> 40:58.238
<i>if he'd been in the big leagues
throughout his career.</i>

40:58.412 --> 41:00.588
But I saw him pitch
and he threw

41:00.762 --> 41:04.026
with very little effort
whatsoever. And the hitters say,

41:04.200 --> 41:05.767
"Well, you can't throw
the next one by me."

41:05.941 --> 41:07.290
Boom. There it goes.

41:07.595 --> 41:09.162
And, well, you're not going
to get that one by me.

41:09.336 --> 41:10.685
Oop, oop! There it goes.

41:11.991 --> 41:15.124
<i>He went out on that mound
and he looked up at the crowd.</i>

41:16.212 --> 41:18.606
He said, "Duty,
the sun is shining,

41:18.780 --> 41:21.043
but I'm gonna make them
think it's nighttime."

41:21.304 --> 41:24.699
<i>He struck out
21 of the 28 men he faced.</i>

41:25.091 --> 41:26.919
<i>We knew when we saw
Satchel Paige pitch,</i>

41:27.093 --> 41:29.008
when I saw Satchel Paige
and Satch could call in

41:29.182 --> 41:32.011
the whole team
and strike everybody out.

41:32.881 --> 41:35.144
You know, I saw that.
He'd call them all in.

41:35.623 --> 41:40.498
<i>Here he is, seven of us,
kneeling around the mound.</i>

41:41.107 --> 41:44.589
<i>He threw nine pitches,
and the side was out.</i>

41:45.459 --> 41:48.244
When he was in the backyard,
he just did amazing things.

41:48.462 --> 41:49.855
Like he'd say, "Look at that.

41:50.595 --> 41:52.858
Look at that berry hanging over
there on the bush.

41:53.032 --> 41:55.948
I bet I can hit it."
And I'd say, "No you can't."

41:56.122 --> 41:58.341
And he would pick up something and...

41:58.516 --> 42:00.126
...hit it and I would say,

42:00.300 --> 42:03.129
"Oh, wow!" You know,
that's what little children do.

42:03.303 --> 42:06.393
They don't think, well,
it was 55 feet away

42:06.567 --> 42:08.264
<i>and it was
the size of a quarter.</i>

42:08.613 --> 42:10.615
<i>You would have to be
a heck of a shot to make it.</i>

42:12.834 --> 42:15.271
<i>Before Gus Greenlee
hired Satchel,</i>

42:15.533 --> 42:18.057
<i>the initial Negro League,</i>

42:18.231 --> 42:19.972
<i>which was formed
by Rube Foster,</i>

42:20.146 --> 42:22.801
<i>had essentially fallen apart.</i>

42:22.975 --> 42:27.109
<i>So in 1933,
Greenlee and some others found</i>

42:27.283 --> 42:29.329
<i>the second
Negro National League.</i>

42:31.244 --> 42:33.681
<i>So they became
the Negro National League.</i>

42:33.855 --> 42:39.034
<i>But now it's all Eastern teams.
And in 1937, the Western teams</i>

42:39.208 --> 42:41.820
<i>organized the Negro American League.</i>

42:42.342 --> 42:44.257
<i>And so, Gus Greenlee</i>

42:44.431 --> 42:48.914
starts to bankroll
a bunch of new... ideas.

42:49.088 --> 42:51.438
<i>And one of those people</i>

42:51.830 --> 42:53.222
<i>talk about is the East-West game.</i>

42:53.396 --> 42:56.008
<i>And it was going to be
the premier event.</i>

42:56.530 --> 42:58.184
Gentleman Dave: <i>They picked
the best of the teams,</i>

42:58.358 --> 43:00.142
<i>players from the East</i>

43:00.403 --> 43:02.405
<i>and the best of the players
from the West,</i>

43:02.580 --> 43:04.973
<i>and they rented Comiskey Park.</i>

43:06.584 --> 43:13.068
<i>We started playing in 1933.
It was only 22,000 that year.</i>

43:13.503 --> 43:16.855
From that day on,
the crowd kept going and going,

43:17.551 --> 43:20.206
until the one time
we had 70,000.

43:20.902 --> 43:22.904
<i>People came
from all over the country.</i>

43:23.078 --> 43:26.516
<i>You had all the entertainers
come in, you got Count Basie,</i>

43:26.691 --> 43:30.433
<i>Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton,
Lena Horne was there.</i>

43:30.651 --> 43:33.785
Anybody who was anybody
was there at that game.

43:33.959 --> 43:36.788
<i>♪ Keep on swingin'
Trying to get to second base ♪</i>

43:37.092 --> 43:39.268
Bob K: <i>This was
the crème de la crème</i>

43:39.878 --> 43:40.835
<i>of baseball.</i>

43:41.662 --> 43:45.013
<i>There's Satchel Paige.
There's Hilton Smith,</i>

43:45.187 --> 43:48.321
<i>there's Josh Gibson,
and Buck Leonard, Mule Suttles.</i>

43:48.495 --> 43:51.324
<i>All these great stars.
They're all there.</i>

43:52.368 --> 43:55.937
Oh, man, you're talking
about a gala affair. A weekend.

43:56.329 --> 43:58.157
<i>They start coming in
by Thursday.</i>

43:58.984 --> 44:00.463
<i>Didn't leave
until Monday morning.</i>

44:01.682 --> 44:04.685
<i>The real impact
of the East-West Classic</i>

44:04.859 --> 44:08.515
<i>was that White sportswriters
started to cover it,</i>

44:09.037 --> 44:12.432
<i>and once they did, some of them,
for the very first time,</i>

44:12.606 --> 44:15.565
<i>saw a kind of baseball
they had never seen before,</i>

44:16.392 --> 44:18.003
<i>where games were won...</i>

44:18.177 --> 44:20.962
<i>...not just with hitting,
but with base stealing,</i>

44:21.397 --> 44:24.009
<i>with these incredibly
acrobatic catches</i>

44:24.183 --> 44:27.403
<i>in the outfield,
with just a level of speed</i>

44:27.839 --> 44:29.754
<i>that they had never seen
in baseball.</i>

44:32.104 --> 44:34.280
And they started
to write about that,

44:34.672 --> 44:40.634
and the appeal that could have
for White fans, as well.

44:41.156 --> 44:44.290
<i>So the East-West classic
is having a big impact</i>

44:44.464 --> 44:47.162
<i>on the vision of the future
for baseball.</i>

47:47.560 --> 47:50.258
<i>and he was very fair skinned.</i>

47:50.868 --> 47:52.782
So he went in,
and he got the rooms

47:52.957 --> 47:54.132
and everything.

47:55.002 --> 47:57.787
So they started
to unload the bus...

47:58.527 --> 48:01.095
...and when the players got off,

48:01.269 --> 48:04.359
they said, "Oh, no, no,
you can't stay here.

48:05.056 --> 48:07.058
This is a White hotel."

48:07.797 --> 48:09.756
<i>Black hotels

48:09.930 --> 48:12.977
<i>even in major cities
like Birmingham, Memphis,</i>

48:13.151 --> 48:15.936
<i>New Orleans, and whatnot,
they were very rare.</i>

48:16.545 --> 48:22.116
And usually the ballplayers
would find a rooming house,

48:22.290 --> 48:24.945
a Black rooming house
in the town,

48:25.163 --> 48:26.773
and that was where
they had to stay.

48:27.339 --> 48:28.818
<i>I can remember a town</i>

48:29.036 --> 48:33.040
<i>where we put up
in a rooming house in Arkansas.</i>

48:33.475 --> 48:34.912
<i>When you turn on the lights,</i>

48:35.260 --> 48:38.611
<i>you see the bedbugs start
to go for cover.</i>

48:39.046 --> 48:40.439
You have to sleep
with the lights on

48:40.613 --> 48:41.788
because if you don't,

48:41.962 --> 48:43.398
those little gremlins
would come out

48:43.572 --> 48:44.922
and you wouldn't get
any sleep anyhow.

48:46.053 --> 48:47.446
<i>Satchel Paige makes</i>

48:47.620 --> 48:49.622
<i>the point one
of his first games.</i>

48:49.796 --> 48:51.102
<i>They arrived at the park</i>

48:51.276 --> 48:52.842
and he said,
"Oh, I'm really tired.

48:53.017 --> 48:55.976
I want to hurry up and get
to bed and get some rest."

48:56.150 --> 48:59.153
And the manager said,
"What bed? What do you mean,

48:59.327 --> 49:00.589
get to rest?

49:00.763 --> 49:02.678
We're staying here
in the ballpark."

49:02.852 --> 49:05.768
I mean, you... you had to sleep
on your suitcase

49:06.291 --> 49:07.770
in the ballpark.

49:08.771 --> 49:11.339
<i>We didn't stop much
because they wouldn't feed us</i>

49:11.513 --> 49:12.645
<i>in the restaurants.</i>

49:13.559 --> 49:15.430
<i>So we had to eat out
of paper sacks</i>

49:15.604 --> 49:17.084
<i>and go in a grocery store.</i>

49:17.302 --> 49:19.173
<i>We got one dollar
a day meal money,</i>

49:19.826 --> 49:21.828
and we would buy
one loaf of bread

49:22.568 --> 49:25.223
and we would buy a jar,
a big jar of peanut butter.

49:26.615 --> 49:30.271
That's what we lived off
of for three or four days.

49:30.837 --> 49:32.926
Peanut butter and bread.

49:34.101 --> 49:36.016
<i>Sometimes I'd wonder,
I'd talk. I'd say,</i>

49:36.190 --> 49:38.453
<i>"Well, how in the world
do they expect you to play ball</i>

49:38.714 --> 49:40.151
<i>and you can't even eat?"</i>

49:40.673 --> 49:42.501
<i>You haven't had a bed
to sleep in.</i>

49:42.675 --> 49:44.068
<i>You slept in a bus.</i>

49:44.807 --> 49:48.115
It wasn't healthy.
It wasn't comfortable at all.

49:49.595 --> 49:54.730
<i>How they could play two
and three games in two days</i>

49:54.992 --> 49:56.906
<i>is really a mystery.</i>

50:00.214 --> 50:02.042
Bob M: <i>On long bus rides,
I had overheard</i>

50:02.216 --> 50:03.696
<i>Negro League players talk</i>

50:03.870 --> 50:05.480
<i>about their incredible experiences</i>

50:05.654 --> 50:07.308
<i>playing winter ball
in the Caribbean.</i>

50:08.440 --> 50:09.963
<i>The players said
that a Black man</i>

50:10.137 --> 50:12.183
<i>could just be a man
and not have to worry</i>

50:12.357 --> 50:14.402
<i>about paying
the social consequences for it.</i>

50:16.274 --> 50:18.232
Bob M: <i>It sounded
about perfect to me.</i>

50:20.234 --> 50:21.583
<i>First,
I played in Puerto Rico,</i>

50:21.757 --> 50:24.064
<i>then I played in Cuba,
and then Mexico.</i>

50:24.499 --> 50:26.110
<i>It was a wonderful place
to play.</i>

50:26.545 --> 50:28.025
They give you a chance
to go down there,

50:28.199 --> 50:30.549
and the salaries
were a little better.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.508
The crowds were better.

50:34.074 --> 50:36.250
<i>The teams in those towns
were the kings of the towns,</i>

50:36.424 --> 50:37.643
<i>it was like high school.</i>

50:37.860 --> 50:39.079
You can say that

50:39.253 --> 50:41.777
when the game was played
on weekends

50:42.213 --> 50:43.866
and the whole town
was at the game.

50:44.650 --> 50:48.654
<i>Fans were more like
football fans, you know,</i>

50:48.828 --> 50:52.049
<i>"rah rah" cheering
and hit a home run</i>

50:52.223 --> 50:55.008
<i>you'd take your cap around
and they'd put money in the cap.</i>

50:55.313 --> 50:58.055
And they had a company
called Don Q Rum.

50:58.403 --> 51:01.058
Every home run you hit,
you'd get a case of Don Q Rum,

51:01.232 --> 51:03.103
you know?
So it was fun.

51:06.019 --> 51:07.803
<i>There little kids
run behind you</i>

51:07.977 --> 51:11.024
<i>and after the ball game,
they want your autograph</i>

51:11.198 --> 51:14.332
<i>and it makes you feel
a part of something,</i>

51:14.506 --> 51:18.597
<i>instead of being something
separate unto itself.</i>

51:20.251 --> 51:22.079
But when you are out
of your own country,

51:22.514 --> 51:25.995
and you find everything
so much better...

51:27.258 --> 51:30.304
you know,
it's a revelation in a way,

51:30.478 --> 51:31.740
if you never experienced it.

51:32.915 --> 51:36.136
<i>But it's like heaven, you know?</i>

51:36.310 --> 51:38.530
<i>I want to go back, you know,
I got to go back there.</i>

51:38.704 --> 51:39.835
<i>I got to go back there.</i>

51:42.664 --> 51:44.666
<i>There was
very little discrimination.</i>

51:44.840 --> 51:47.016
<i>So you felt, you know, free.</i>

51:47.800 --> 51:49.149
<i>The fact that, you know,</i>

51:49.410 --> 51:51.151
<i>you were accepted
for your ability,</i>

51:51.325 --> 51:52.979
<i>not from the color of your skin,</i>

51:53.545 --> 51:55.199
<i>and that really
made you feel great.</i>

51:59.551 --> 52:01.292
<i>I think
from the very beginning,</i>

52:01.596 --> 52:05.426
<i>there was a sense of a kind
of a solidarity or connection</i>

52:05.600 --> 52:08.821
between Black players here
and Latin players,

52:08.995 --> 52:10.127
dark Latin players.

52:10.518 --> 52:11.998
<i>So in some ways,</i>

52:12.172 --> 52:14.783
<i>baseball generated
a kind of diaspora,</i>

52:14.957 --> 52:17.264
<i>'cause these Black Latin players</i>

52:17.438 --> 52:19.136
<i>could not play
Major League Baseball either.</i>

52:19.310 --> 52:20.833
<i>They had to play
in the Negro Leagues</i>

52:21.007 --> 52:22.878
<i>that they were playing
in the United States.</i>

52:23.879 --> 52:27.056
<i>And so Martín Dihigo
and José Méndez,</i>

52:27.231 --> 52:29.189
<i>Cristóbal Torriente,</i>

52:29.668 --> 52:32.888
the game was just full
of Latino ballplayers.

52:34.238 --> 52:36.762
<i>Negro Leagues
was a rainbow coalition</i>

52:37.545 --> 52:38.938
<i>of players of color,</i>

52:39.330 --> 52:41.114
everything from chalk
to charcoal.

52:41.549 --> 52:42.942
That was the pigmentation

52:43.116 --> 52:44.335
<i>that played
in the Negro Leagues.</i>

52:51.951 --> 52:54.649
News reporter: <i>Millions enjoy
a great year in American sports.</i>

52:54.823 --> 52:56.303
<i>But Dizzy and Daffy Dean,</i>

52:56.477 --> 52:58.871
<i>the Cardinal Ace's
new national heroes.</i>

53:00.829 --> 53:03.354
<i>Dizzy Dean
pretty much saved baseball</i>

53:03.528 --> 53:04.833
<i>during the Depression.</i>

53:05.225 --> 53:08.707
Babe Ruth was kind of fading out
for the Depression 1934,

53:08.968 --> 53:10.970
<i>and him and his brother
come in with the Cardinals.</i>

53:11.144 --> 53:12.537
<i>They win the pennant,</i>

53:12.754 --> 53:14.147
<i>and then they go
to the World Series.</i>

53:14.321 --> 53:16.062
<i>So they're like
on top of the world.</i>

53:16.236 --> 53:19.457
And they could have gone home,
but they were gonna barnstorm.

53:19.674 --> 53:22.851
And so they played
in that particular year, 1934.

53:23.025 --> 53:25.463
<i>They play six games
against Kansas City Monarchs,</i>

53:25.767 --> 53:27.769
<i>two against
the Philadelphia Stars,</i>

53:28.030 --> 53:30.032
<i>three against
the Pittsburgh Crawfords,</i>

53:30.294 --> 53:32.383
<i>and two against
the New York Black Yankees.</i>

53:32.557 --> 53:34.298
<i>And they tour all the way
across the country.</i>

53:36.256 --> 53:38.084
<i>But people didn't,
hadn't seen Blacks</i>

53:38.258 --> 53:41.957
<i>and Major League All-Star teams
mix too much in those days.</i>

53:42.567 --> 53:46.048
<i>So we always had large crowds.
I think we played ten games.</i>

53:46.440 --> 53:47.876
<i>We played against</i>

53:48.050 --> 53:49.965
<i>Dizzy Dean and his brother
in Cleveland,</i>

53:50.227 --> 53:51.880
<i>and they had a sellout crowd. And...</i>

53:52.838 --> 53:55.232
<i>Satchel beat Dizzy two-one
in 12 innings.</i>

53:55.928 --> 53:59.801
Bob K: <i>The record books bear out
that the Black teams</i>

53:59.975 --> 54:03.022
<i>won the majority
of those head-to-head matchups.</i>

54:03.196 --> 54:06.155
<i>What that tells me, number one,
is there was no doubt</i>

54:06.591 --> 54:08.767
<i>in the minds
of those Major League athletes</i>

54:08.941 --> 54:10.247
that these guys could play.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.553
<i>Now,</i>

54:12.988 --> 54:14.773
<i>we knew that we could play
baseball with anybody.</i>

54:15.077 --> 54:17.210
<i>If you've got Satchel
on your team,</i>

54:17.384 --> 54:21.170
<i>you can play our teams
that got nine devils on it.</i>

54:21.475 --> 54:23.216
<i>Somebody asked
Dizzy Dean, they said,</i>

54:23.390 --> 54:25.131
"Who's the greatest pitcher
you ever saw?"

54:25.305 --> 54:27.873
And Dizzy Dean was known
to be a little conceited,

54:28.134 --> 54:30.484
and they figured he's gonna
start talking about himself.

54:30.745 --> 54:32.181
He said, and he told them

54:32.617 --> 54:33.705
that the greatest pitcher
he ever saw was a Colored boy

54:33.879 --> 54:35.315
named Satchel Paige.

54:35.576 --> 54:37.230
He said, "If you can get him
and me on the same team,

54:37.404 --> 54:39.624
we could win the pennant
by the 4th of July

54:39.798 --> 54:41.626
and go fishing
until the World Series started."

54:43.802 --> 54:45.847
<i>I remember
we were playing in California</i>

54:46.021 --> 54:47.414
<i>in the winter league,</i>

54:47.632 --> 54:49.242
<i>and I was with
Satchel Paige's All-Stars.</i>

54:49.808 --> 54:52.463
<i>And we were playing
the Major Leagues All-Stars.</i>

54:52.811 --> 54:54.421
<i>And we played three Sundays.</i>

54:54.682 --> 54:56.510
And then Judge Landis,
who was the commissioner

54:56.684 --> 54:57.990
at that time,

54:58.382 --> 54:59.992
sent a telegram out
and told the Major Leaguers

55:00.166 --> 55:01.646
not to play us any more

55:02.037 --> 55:04.823
because they had everything
to lose and nothing to gain.

55:05.171 --> 55:07.434
We had everything to gain
and nothing to lose.

55:08.043 --> 55:12.918
I can only be for the best team
in each league to win a pennant.

55:13.397 --> 55:18.271
But to you fans, no heartaches
and not even a grouch.

55:18.489 --> 55:19.794
May you all win.

55:20.665 --> 55:22.319
<i>Kenesaw Mountain Landis</i>

55:22.580 --> 55:24.321
<i>is brought in as the first
commissioner of baseball</i>

55:24.495 --> 55:27.062
<i>after the Black Sox scandal
of 1919,</i>

55:27.759 --> 55:30.065
<i>which was the throwing
of the World Series.</i>

55:30.849 --> 55:33.982
<i>So the owners give
Kenesaw Mountain Landis</i>

55:34.156 --> 55:36.463
<i>essentially almost
dictatorial powers,</i>

55:36.898 --> 55:39.161
because they needed to clean up
the image of baseball

55:39.336 --> 55:40.685
after the Black Sox scandal.

55:41.729 --> 55:45.603
<i>Whatever views Landis had,
we know that by his actions,</i>

55:45.777 --> 55:50.347
<i>he maintained segregation
in Major League Baseball</i>

55:50.608 --> 55:53.567
<i>far longer than it needed
to be maintained.</i>

55:54.655 --> 55:59.791
Landis will soon prevent teams
of Major Leaguers

55:59.965 --> 56:03.011
from barnstorming against teams
of Negro Leaguers

56:03.229 --> 56:04.361
because he doesn't want

56:04.970 --> 56:07.842
intact Major League teams
being defeated.

56:08.190 --> 56:12.630
Whatever he says about,
"Oh, there's no law.

56:12.847 --> 56:15.633
There's no rule
against integration."

56:15.894 --> 56:22.291
The reality is, at every step,
he did nothing but block it.

56:22.640 --> 56:24.163
News reporter: <i>Today,</i>

and that's when the relationship
between him and Gus Greenlee

56:53.366 --> 56:54.323
becomes...

56:55.716 --> 56:57.457
strained.

56:57.762 --> 57:01.156
<i>By 1937, he had put in
two, like, really great seasons</i>

57:01.330 --> 57:02.767
<i>for Gus Greenlee.</i>

57:03.028 --> 57:05.683
He was back with the Crawfords,
and all of a sudden,

57:05.944 --> 57:10.601
these guys start
hanging around the stadium,

57:11.079 --> 57:13.734
<i>and it turns out
that they were emissaries</i>

57:13.995 --> 57:17.477
<i>from the strong man

57:17.651 --> 57:19.348
<i>Trujillo.</i>

57:19.523 --> 57:22.613
<i>So he sent his emissary
with 30,000 dollars</i>

57:22.787 --> 57:24.571
<i>to offer Satchel Paige</i>

57:24.745 --> 57:27.052
to play for him,
and then also carte blanche

57:27.226 --> 57:30.316
to then bring as many players
as he could bring with him.

57:31.273 --> 57:33.580
<i>Paige then was able
to reach out</i>

57:33.754 --> 57:36.540

Negro League players,</i>

57:36.714 --> 57:38.585

on the Crawfords.</i>

57:38.759 --> 57:42.110
"And yeah, I'll go with you.
Sure. For what? How much money?

57:42.284 --> 57:45.723
Pay me a couple thousand.
Oh, yeah, right. I'm coming."

57:48.290 --> 57:51.337
<i>Paige brought in a total
of nine Pittsburgh Crawfords</i>

57:51.511 --> 57:53.252
<i>from a roster of 16.</i>

57:54.035 --> 57:56.603
But it destroyed
the Pittsburgh Crawfords

57:56.777 --> 57:59.084
because they lost
their best players.

58:00.781 --> 58:03.088
<i>By 1938, they were history.</i>

58:04.742 --> 58:08.180
<i>It was too bad because Greenlee
did a great deal</i>

58:08.746 --> 58:10.138
<i>for Black baseball.</i>

58:10.530 --> 58:11.923
<i>So at that point,</i>

58:12.097 --> 58:13.881
<i>Cum Posey takes advantage, pounces.</i>

58:14.055 --> 58:15.927
<i>And he lured Josh Gibson back,</i>

58:16.101 --> 58:18.190
<i>started stealing
some of the players back.</i>

58:18.364 --> 58:20.409

58:20.627 --> 58:23.587
really, the last great
Negro League dynasty,

58:24.022 --> 58:26.372

<i>in the history of this country.</i>

59:27.607 --> 59:30.131
<i>Black soldiers were always put

59:35.136 --> 59:38.487
<i>On the battlefields

59:38.749 --> 59:41.142
<i>I would endure

59:42.056 --> 59:43.884
<i>More than half
of my company was killed.</i>

59:44.885 --> 59:47.366
<i>There were so many
dead bodies lying around,</i>

59:47.584 --> 59:49.194
<i>they could have covered
the playing field</i>

59:49.368 --> 59:51.544
<i>of any Major League ballpark
with the corpses.</i>

59:53.198 --> 59:55.853
<i>I had given America
two and a half years of service,</i>

59:56.549 --> 59:58.072
<i>and the country still
had not granted</i>

59:58.246 --> 01:00:00.945
<i>full rights to me
or my Black brothers.</i>

01:00:03.251 --> 01:00:04.862
<i>It was a huge contradiction</i>

01:00:05.036 --> 01:00:06.951
<i>that Americans were fighting
this war effort</i>

01:00:07.125 --> 01:00:11.303
<i>on behalf of civil rights
and liberties for people abroad.</i>

01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:13.261
<i>And Black people understood</i>

01:00:13.435 --> 01:00:15.481
<i>that they were still
second class citizens at home.</i>

01:00:16.351 --> 01:00:19.703
And I think Black people
took that as an opportunity

01:00:19.877 --> 01:00:21.182
to start pushing for more.

01:00:23.445 --> 01:00:25.012
<i>The Double V campaign</i>

01:00:25.186 --> 01:00:26.274

<i>The</i> Courier <i>rallied
Black opinion</i>

01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:31.889
<i>around the country,</i>

01:00:32.237 --> 01:00:35.066
<i>around the idea
of "We will support this war.</i>

01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:38.286
<i>We will enlist to fight.</i>

01:00:38.765 --> 01:00:41.681
<i>We will buy war bonds
and support the war.</i>

01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:45.729
We will be patriotic,
but we want it understood,

01:00:46.555 --> 01:00:49.384
that when the war is over,
we are going to get our rights."

01:00:50.168 --> 01:00:52.866
<i>And this is what they call
the Double Victory campaign.</i>

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:59.525
<i>The idea of having
to fight two wars, one overseas,</i>

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:02.920
<i>and more importantly, one here
at home against segregation.</i>

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:05.400
And in that discussion
comes one of, I think,

01:01:05.574 --> 01:01:08.665
one of the most powerful images
and stories that comes out

01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:10.971
is the idea they can fight,

01:01:11.276 --> 01:01:13.582
and go, and fight,
and die at Guadalcanal,

01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:15.672
but they can't play
on a diamond together?

01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:19.327
<i>At the time,</i>

01:01:19.588 --> 01:01:21.373
<i>baseball was America's
most important sport,</i>

01:01:21.547 --> 01:01:23.636
<i>and so integrating that</i>

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:27.074
<i>they felt symbolically
would be such a major step</i>

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:29.729
<i>to see Black people
and White people</i>

01:01:29.903 --> 01:01:31.688
working together
on the same team

01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:34.516
to achieve a common goal
of winning a game.

01:01:35.082 --> 01:01:36.475
<i>I was involved</i>

01:01:36.649 --> 01:01:38.390
<i>in an organization
of young people</i>

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.435
<i>interested in breaking</i>

01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:42.742
<i>the Jim Crow ban
in the big leagues.</i>

01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:46.180
<i>We used to go collect signatures</i>

01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:50.228
<i>from the fans
coming into Forbes Field</i>

01:01:50.576 --> 01:01:55.494
that we want to have Negroes
get into the big leagues,

01:01:55.668 --> 01:01:57.365
<i>and there were lots of petitions</i>

01:01:57.539 --> 01:02:00.238
<i>like we were making
in Pittsburgh, in New York.</i>

01:02:00.455 --> 01:02:01.805
<i>Many, many petitions</i>

01:02:01.979 --> 01:02:04.590
<i>were gathered
at the Yankee Stadium.</i>

01:02:04.764 --> 01:02:08.246
The owners knew
that this has got to change.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.683
Bob K: <i>Now, the Black press</i>

01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:15.557
<i>was pushing this agenda
all along. Sam Lacy, Faye Young.</i>

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.472
There were other
great Black writers

01:02:17.646 --> 01:02:21.825
who were all trying to alter
the course of baseball

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:25.045
and move Black folks
into Major League Baseball.

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:27.004
<i>But Wendell Smith,</i>

01:02:27.526 --> 01:02:30.659
<i>one of the great Black writers
of that era,</i>

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:33.227
<i>was really
its primary front man.</i>

01:02:35.012 --> 01:02:36.578
<i>Wendell Smith
started writing</i>

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:39.538
<i>this whole series of stories
about the issue.</i>

01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:44.369
<i>And so, when teams came to play
in Pittsburgh at Forbes Field,</i>

01:02:44.543 --> 01:02:47.415
<i>he would park himself
at the Schenley Hotel</i>

01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:49.287
<i>across the street
from the ballpark</i>

01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:53.900
<i>and buttonhole the top managers
and coaches and players and say,</i>

01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:57.121
<i>"Are you in favor of integrating
the Major Leagues?"</i>

01:02:57.295 --> 01:02:58.949
<i>And he got all of these top,</i>

01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:01.473
<i>well-known people
on the record saying "Yes."</i>

01:03:01.908 --> 01:03:04.432
And then he and other
sportswriters used

01:03:04.606 --> 01:03:07.044
some of that data
to start pressuring

01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.046
<i>the Commissioner Landis</i>

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:12.092
<i>to consider the integration
of Major League Baseball.</i>

01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:14.573
<i>And he had been dodging
the whole issue</i>

01:03:14.747 --> 01:03:16.880
<i>for a couple of decades.</i>

01:03:17.054 --> 01:03:23.669
<i>In December 1943,
leaders of the Black newspapers</i>

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:27.455
met with the commissioner
of baseball

01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:32.460
and the owners of baseball

01:03:33.026 --> 01:03:35.637
<i>about getting Blacks
into the big leagues.</i>

01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:40.338
<i>And they selected Paul Robeson
to be the spokesman</i>

01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:42.644
<i>of the delegation here
in New York.</i>

01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:54.613
Paul Jr: <i>Dad was then a great
theatrical star, film star,</i>

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:58.182
<i>the leading concert artist
in the country and in the world.</i>

01:03:58.878 --> 01:04:00.358
So my father's attitude was, especially,

01:04:00.532 --> 01:04:01.838
because I've reached
this pinnacle,

01:04:02.012 --> 01:04:03.404
because I'm who I am...

01:04:04.971 --> 01:04:07.321
I have to do whatever I can do

01:04:07.495 --> 01:04:10.803
to advance the interests
of African Americans as a whole.

01:04:10.977 --> 01:04:12.326
<i>And in this case,</i>

01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:15.590
<i>what better way than to throw
my weight behind the campaign</i>

01:04:15.808 --> 01:04:17.418
<i>to break the segregation</i>

01:04:17.592 --> 01:04:20.160
<i>in organized baseball
in particular.</i>

01:04:21.379 --> 01:04:22.946
<i>So Paul explained</i>

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:25.774
<i>to the commissioner
and to the others,</i>

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:29.604
<i>"We have a million Blacks
in the armed forces,</i>

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:32.607
and now, right during this war,

01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:37.221
they... You still have this ban
against them in what sport?

01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:38.657
The national sport.

01:04:39.223 --> 01:04:42.487
<i>How does that fit in
with what we're fighting for?"</i>

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:44.489
Voice as Paul Sr:
<i>We live in times</i>

01:04:44.663 --> 01:04:47.100
<i>when the world
is changing very fast,</i>

01:04:47.492 --> 01:04:49.886
<i>when you may be able
to make a great contribution</i>

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:52.453
<i>to not only the advance
of our own country</i>

01:04:52.627 --> 01:04:54.499
<i>but of the whole world.</i>

01:04:54.673 --> 01:04:56.631
<i>Because a thing like this...</i>

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.546
<i>...Negro ballplayers becoming</i>

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.027
<i>a part of the great
national pastime of America...</i>

01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:03.464
<i>can make a great difference</i>

01:05:03.638 --> 01:05:04.901
<i>in what peoples
all over the world</i>

01:05:05.075 --> 01:05:06.728

01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:09.688
<i>in a time
when we need their help.</i>

01:05:11.603 --> 01:05:15.215
Paul Jr: <i>He made about a ten,
12-minute presentation,</i>

01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:18.784
which was quite impassioned.
It was off-the-cuff

01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:21.656
and really had
an enormous effect

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:24.224
on the owners,
apparently because unusual,

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:27.097
they applauded at the end
and all that.

01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:29.534
And then of course,
everybody withdrew,

01:05:29.708 --> 01:05:33.277
and they went back
into private session.

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:35.757

01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.551
<i>And Landis said,</i>

01:05:46.725 --> 01:05:49.293
<i>"We have considered it.
No action has been taken."</i>

01:05:51.469 --> 01:05:54.428
<i>He said, "It is a matter

01:05:54.602 --> 01:05:56.604
<i>whether or not to sign
a Black player."</i>

01:05:57.344 --> 01:06:00.130
But as long
as he is the commissioner,

01:06:00.391 --> 01:06:04.482

<i>a good time for musicians.</i>

01:07:37.575 --> 01:07:39.272
They would come to the ballgame,
see us play.

01:07:39.446 --> 01:07:40.969
And at night we go on

01:07:41.144 --> 01:07:42.928
<i>dance and everything.</i>

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:45.452
<i>By the time

01:07:45.626 --> 01:07:47.889
<i>this is the heyday
of Black baseball.</i>

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:49.587
Because of World War II,

01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:51.632
there's money pouring
into the Black community, right?

01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:53.156
<i>Like defense hiring,</i>

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.158
<i>these manufacturers
can no longer say,</i>

01:07:55.332 --> 01:07:56.724
<i>"Well, we're not gonna hire you
'cause you're Black."</i>

01:07:56.898 --> 01:07:58.335
<i>It's all hands on deck, right?</i>

01:07:58.596 --> 01:08:02.208
So now, Black people
in the general community

01:08:02.382 --> 01:08:03.949
have more money to go
to baseball games

01:08:04.123 --> 01:08:05.864
and to support
these institutions.

01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:09.607
<i>So by the late '30s
and early '40s</i>

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:12.827
<i>Black baseball was considered
to be the third largest</i>

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.134
economic institution
in the Black community.

01:08:15.656 --> 01:08:17.267
<i>'Cause you have vendors,</i>

01:08:17.615 --> 01:08:19.399
<i>and you have advertising,
and you have ticket sales,</i>

01:08:19.573 --> 01:08:22.881
<i>and you have all of these
other aspects to the game</i>

01:08:23.055 --> 01:08:24.229
<i>that weren't considered,
you know.</i>

01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:26.058
People were making
money from it.

01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:30.279
Bob K: <i>The impact that it had
on urban communities</i>

01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:34.631
<i>was something that
we've not seen to that magnitude</i>

01:08:34.805 --> 01:08:36.112
<i>since the Negro Leagues.</i>

01:08:36.286 --> 01:08:37.983
So when we think
about Black baseball

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:41.421
and its impact on cities
like Chicago,

01:08:41.769 --> 01:08:43.944
Kansas City, New York.

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:46.992
<i>Wherever you had
successful Black baseball,</i>

01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:51.256
<i>you typically had
thriving Black economies.</i>

<i>♪ They got some

01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:56.044
Bob M: <i>My arrival
in Kansas City in 1946</i>

01:08:56.219 --> 01:08:59.395
<i>came at an exciting time
for Black baseball in the town.</i>

01:09:00.919 --> 01:09:02.399
Bob M:
<i>When the Monarchs advanced</i>

01:09:02.573 --> 01:09:03.965
<i>to the Negro League
World Series that year</i>

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.792
<i>against the hot contender
from the East,</i>

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:07.621
<i>the Newark Eagles.</i>

01:09:08.055 --> 01:09:09.928
<i>They were run
by powerhouse owners,</i>

01:09:10.145 --> 01:09:12.452
<i>Abe and Effa Manley.</i>

01:09:14.541 --> 01:09:16.630
<i>The ballplayers,
they have a word they used.</i>

01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:18.893
<i>I realized it
was the most important word</i>

01:09:19.067 --> 01:09:21.679
<i>in their vocabulary,
and the word is "satisfied."</i>

01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:24.856
<i>"I am satisfied."
If they're not satisfied,</i>

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:26.944
<i>all you've got is a guy
in a uniform.</i>

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:28.511
<i>And then on the case</i>

01:09:28.685 --> 01:09:30.035
<i>of our old time
Negro ballplayers,</i>

01:09:30.209 --> 01:09:31.993
<i>they were happy doing
what they did.</i>

01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:36.345
<i>Effa Manley was a woman</i>

01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.131
<i>who said the things
that needed to be said,</i>

01:09:39.305 --> 01:09:40.959
even if nobody wanted
to hear 'em,

01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:43.091
and did the things
that needed to be done,

01:09:43.265 --> 01:09:45.093
even if nobody else
wanted to do them.

01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:46.617
<i>She is called</i>

01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:47.705
<i>"The First Lady
of Black baseball"</i>

01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:49.402
<i>because there really,</i>

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:51.578
<i>at that time
and pretty much after that,</i>

01:09:51.752 --> 01:09:53.493
<i>weren't any other women</i>

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:56.496
<i>closely involved in successful
Black baseball teams.</i>

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:59.586
And there weren't very many
other women closely involved

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.806
with successful
White baseball teams, either.

01:10:02.241 --> 01:10:04.200
<i>But she was also an enigma.</i>

01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:08.421
<i>There's questions of like,
"Was Effa Black? Was Effa White?</i>

01:10:08.595 --> 01:10:09.901
<i>Was she passing,</i>

01:10:10.249 --> 01:10:11.816
or was she just living
her truth?

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:13.165
Was she just living her life?"

01:10:15.123 --> 01:10:16.951
<i>Before she gets
into baseball,</i>

01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:21.434
<i>she comes of age in Harlem
in the 1920s and early '30s,</i>

01:10:21.782 --> 01:10:23.958
<i>and she is absorbing all of it.</i>

01:10:24.524 --> 01:10:27.875
<i>I immediately became
very much involved</i>

01:10:28.049 --> 01:10:30.400
<i>in civic affairs.</i>

01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:32.793
<i>I was attending
a dinner one night,</i>

01:10:32.967 --> 01:10:34.752
<i>and we got
into this conversation</i>

01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:38.146
<i>about how hard it was
for Negroes to find employment.</i>

01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:41.628
<i>The department stores
and other big stores</i>

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:43.326
<i>on 125th Street in Harlem,</i>

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.329
which was the main
business street there, had no,

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:48.026
other than elevator operators,

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.898
you couldn't see
a Black employee in the store.

01:10:51.508 --> 01:10:53.858
<i>So she decides
to launch a boycott</i>

01:10:54.032 --> 01:10:56.295
<i>against a department store
in Harlem,</i>

01:10:56.469 --> 01:10:59.342
<i>because even though 70,
75 percent of their sales</i>

01:10:59.516 --> 01:11:01.169
<i>were coming
from the Black community,</i>

01:11:01.344 --> 01:11:02.867
<i>they would not hire
Black women as salesclerks.</i>

01:11:33.201 --> 01:11:35.639
<i>It worked.
And if you were gonna see</i>

01:11:35.813 --> 01:11:37.728
<i>how Effa Manley
was gonna run her team</i>

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:39.382
<i>in the Negro National League,</i>

01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:40.861
<i>you need only look
at those few months</i>

01:11:41.035 --> 01:11:42.515
<i>in Harlem in 1934.</i>

01:11:47.651 --> 01:11:51.568
<i>Abe Manley was involved
in numbers operations,</i>

01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:55.049
<i>and Abe had always been
a really big fan</i>

01:11:55.223 --> 01:11:56.703
<i>of Black baseball.</i>

01:11:57.182 --> 01:12:00.968
<i>Once he marries Effa and sees
what Effa is capable of</i>

01:12:01.142 --> 01:12:04.145
<i>during this Blumstein's boycott.
He can trust her.</i>

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.060
He knows that
she will do the work,

01:12:06.234 --> 01:12:08.585
that she is smart,
that she is savvy.

01:12:08.759 --> 01:12:12.719
He's like, "Yeah, let me give
this Black baseball thing a go."

01:12:12.893 --> 01:12:14.199
<i>Little by little,</i>

01:12:14.373 --> 01:12:16.375
<i>I found myself
doing more and more.</i>

01:12:16.549 --> 01:12:19.770
<i>I drew up the schedules,
bought the equipment,</i>

01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:21.815
<i>went to all of the meetings,
of course.</i>

01:12:21.989 --> 01:12:24.252
<i>I found myself
completely involved,</i>

01:12:24.427 --> 01:12:25.906
<i>and I enjoyed it.</i>

01:12:26.559 --> 01:12:28.953
Bob K:
<i>She was a shrewd negotiator.</i>

01:12:29.301 --> 01:12:32.957
She knew the business
of baseball as well as any man,

01:12:33.261 --> 01:12:35.307
and Monte Irvin
was fond of saying,

01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:37.309
"She never missed a payday."

01:12:37.614 --> 01:12:39.180
You had a lot of respect
for her,

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:42.227
and she tried to keep you on,
you know, tried to,

01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:43.576
particularly young fellas.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.056
She'd try to advise them
what to do,

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:46.623
how to do it
and that kind of a thing.

01:12:46.797 --> 01:12:48.320
<i>But I think
it was her ability</i>

01:12:48.494 --> 01:12:50.583
<i>and her characteristics
and what she was like</i>

01:12:50.757 --> 01:12:53.412
and what she wanted
the League to look like

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.110
that made her a presence

01:12:56.284 --> 01:12:59.505
in the Negro League situation,
you know? Very important. Yeah.

01:13:05.424 --> 01:13:08.688
<i>For many years in the '40s,
the Homestead Grays</i>

01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:10.603
<i>were constantly winning
the pennant,</i>

01:13:10.777 --> 01:13:12.257
<i>and the Eagles
were right behind them.</i>

01:13:12.649 --> 01:13:14.868
And in 1946,
they finally caught up.

01:13:15.303 --> 01:13:16.957
<i>It was special for Effa.</i>

01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:19.482
<i>She'd been in baseball
at this point, her and Abe,</i>

01:13:19.656 --> 01:13:21.222
<i>for over a decade.</i>

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:24.051
And this was the moment
that she had been working to.

01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:26.358
<i>She had Larry Doby,</i>

01:13:26.532 --> 01:13:28.534
<i>who became the first player
in the American League,</i>

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.014
<i>when he signed</i>

01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:31.885
<i>with the baseball team
out of Cleveland.</i>

01:13:32.277 --> 01:13:35.323
<i>Monte Irvin was on that team,
Leon Day was on that team.</i>

01:13:35.672 --> 01:13:37.369
Bob K: <i>Leon Day throws</i>

01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:39.502
<i>an opening day no-hitter...</i>

01:13:39.806 --> 01:13:41.112
<i>...in 1946.</i>

01:13:42.418 --> 01:13:45.508
Opening day,
that was tremendous.

01:13:45.682 --> 01:13:46.857
It was... I mean, it was...

01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:49.729
That's why that reaction,
it was shock.

01:13:50.034 --> 01:13:51.557
<i>The Black people threw
the little blue cushions</i>

01:13:52.079 --> 01:13:53.690
<i>they used to give you to sit on,</i>

01:13:53.864 --> 01:13:55.343
<i>they just covered
the stadium with pillows.</i>

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.302
And pillows were sailing out
from all over the place.

01:13:57.476 --> 01:13:58.782
I was a little boy
looking at that,

01:13:58.956 --> 01:14:00.523
I thought... I was like,
"Wow, look at this."

01:14:01.262 --> 01:14:04.352
Bob K: <i>And the Newark Eagles
rode that wave</i>

01:14:04.527 --> 01:14:06.224
<i>all the way to the World Series</i>

01:14:06.398 --> 01:14:08.095
<i>against the Kansas City Monarchs.</i>

01:14:08.269 --> 01:14:10.663
<i>The Monarchs were ahead,
three games to two,</i>

01:14:10.837 --> 01:14:12.622
<i>and were on the verge
of winning.</i>

01:14:12.796 --> 01:14:15.842
<i>The Eagles won a slugfest
in the sixth game to tie it up.</i>

01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:17.409
<i>So they're back
at Rupert Stadium</i>

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:18.715
<i>for the seventh game.</i>

01:14:19.498 --> 01:14:20.760
<i>And he gets to the ninth inning.</i>

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:22.545
The Eagles are ahead,
three to two.

01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:25.330
<i>Monarchs last chance.
First guy makes an out,</i>

01:14:25.504 --> 01:14:26.766
<i>the second guy singles,</i>

01:14:26.940 --> 01:14:28.376
<i>but he's thrown out at second,</i>

01:14:28.551 --> 01:14:30.378
<i>trying to stretch it
into a double.</i>

01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:31.858
<i>So now there are two outs,</i>

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:35.296
<i>and Effa Manley is just
as nervous as a cat</i>

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:36.907
<i>because the next guy gets a hit.</i>

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:39.866
<i>She's something
like in her memoirs,</i>

01:14:40.171 --> 01:14:43.087
<i>"How can a human heart
take all this tension?"</i>

01:14:43.261 --> 01:14:44.741
<i>She says, "I can't look,</i>

01:14:44.915 --> 01:14:46.960
I hear the crack of the bat
and I can't look.

01:14:47.134 --> 01:14:48.571
I finally opened my eyes,

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:50.703
<i>and the ball is coming
right down</i>

01:14:50.877 --> 01:14:52.139
<i>in first baseman
Lennie Pearson's mitt."</i>

01:14:52.313 --> 01:14:54.881
<i>He grabs it. The Eagles win.</i>

01:14:57.362 --> 01:15:01.018
<i>Boy, did we have
a ballclub in 1946.[chuckling]</i>

01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:03.063
<i>I don't believe</i>

01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:05.283
<i>any ballclub in the country
could have beaten us.</i>

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:11.637
<i>I'm in the Navy.</i>

01:15:12.116 --> 01:15:14.988
<i>I'm a boatswain,
stevedore platoon.</i>

01:15:15.162 --> 01:15:16.860
<i>It's an all Black battalion.</i>

01:15:17.817 --> 01:15:19.210
It's 10:30 at night.

01:15:19.384 --> 01:15:22.169
Everybody's in bed,
and the officer said,

01:15:22.343 --> 01:15:23.997
the officer of the day,

01:15:24.955 --> 01:15:26.870
"Boatswain O'Neil,
come to my office at once."

01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:29.002
I say, "Oh, hell,
what did I do now?"

01:15:29.176 --> 01:15:30.961
He said, "You know what?"
I say, "No, sir."

01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:33.920
"Branch Rickey
just signed Jackie

01:15:34.094 --> 01:15:36.314
to an organized
baseball contract."

01:15:36.575 --> 01:15:39.622
I say, "Whoop,
give me that horn."

01:15:39.839 --> 01:15:41.188
I got on it.

01:15:41.362 --> 01:15:43.495
I say, "Hear this,
hear this, hear this."

01:15:43.756 --> 01:15:45.715
Woke up the entire camp.

01:15:46.585 --> 01:15:49.066
And I said, "Branch Rickey
just signed Jackie Robinson

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.198
to an organized
baseball contract."

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.549
They whoop, they holler,
they shot their guns.

01:15:53.897 --> 01:15:57.422
We didn't sleep much that night.
Oh, man. That was it.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:15:59.990
I came out of the service,

01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:02.383
I joined a baseball team.
In a year or so,

01:16:02.558 --> 01:16:05.256
I was with
the organized baseball,

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:06.779
and in a very short time,

01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:08.694
<i>I was up there
in the Major Leagues.</i>

01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:10.870
<i>Boy, I was a pretty lucky fellow
because we do pretty well</i>

01:16:11.044 --> 01:16:12.480
<i>in the Major League
in baseball.</i>

01:16:14.091 --> 01:16:19.052
<i>♪ I got a good thing
A good thing going on ♪</i>

01:16:21.054 --> 01:16:26.190
<i>♪ I got a good thing
A good thing going on ♪</i>

01:16:27.104 --> 01:16:30.063
<i>♪ Woke up this mornin'
It's a brand-new day ♪</i>

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:32.718
<i>♪ And I know everything's
Gonna come my way ♪</i>

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:39.116
<i>♪ 'Cause I got a good thing
A good thing going on ♪</i>

01:16:42.249 --> 01:16:45.992
<i>Jackie Robinson had been
this incredible athlete at UCLA,</i>

01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:48.125
<i>and he was known
across the country</i>

01:16:48.299 --> 01:16:49.866
<i>as this football star,</i>

01:16:50.127 --> 01:16:51.694
<i>but there was no avenue
for him to play football.</i>

01:16:51.868 --> 01:16:54.697
And so, baseball really became
the best outlet for him

01:16:54.871 --> 01:16:57.482
to be a professional athlete
to make money.

01:16:57.830 --> 01:17:00.920
And that door opened for him
through the Negro Leagues,

01:17:01.094 --> 01:17:02.356
<i>through the Kansas City Monarchs.</i>

01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:04.315
<i>At the time,</i>

01:17:04.489 --> 01:17:07.361
<i>Wendell Smith decided
that Jackie Robinson</i>

01:17:07.535 --> 01:17:10.756
was the player
that had the best odds

01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:12.802
of breaking through
into the Major Leagues

01:17:12.976 --> 01:17:14.455
because he had
the right temperament,

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:15.979
<i>and he had the right look</i>

01:17:16.414 --> 01:17:18.764
<i>that would be accepted
by White fans.</i>

01:17:18.938 --> 01:17:20.897
<i>So it was actually Wendell Smith</i>

01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:24.988
<i>who put Jackie Robinson
on Branch Rickey's radar screen.</i>

01:17:28.208 --> 01:17:29.688
<i>Organized baseball</i>

01:17:29.862 --> 01:17:31.690
<i>hasn't had a Negro player
since 1884,</i>

01:17:31.864 --> 01:17:33.518
<i>when Moses Walker
was with Toledo.</i>

01:17:33.692 --> 01:17:36.956
<i>But 63 years later, in 1947,</i>

01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.132
<i>Jackie Robinson
joined the Brooklyn Dodgers</i>

01:17:39.306 --> 01:17:40.612
<i>and blasted his way to stardom.</i>

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:44.398
Bob M: <i>We never thought
we'd lived to see the day</i>

01:17:44.572 --> 01:17:46.487
<i>when a Black man would be
admitted into the Major Leagues.</i>

01:17:47.184 --> 01:17:49.142
<i>Equality was within our reach.</i>

01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:52.885
<i>If a Black man could integrate
the great American pastime,</i>

01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:55.279
<i>anything seemed possible.</i>

01:17:56.628 --> 01:17:59.631
Every Sunday
in my hometown Fairfield,

01:18:00.458 --> 01:18:02.590
I would read about three guys,

01:18:03.635 --> 01:18:07.204
<i>Joe DiMaggio,
Ted Williams, Stan Musial.</i>

01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:09.032
<i>Those are the guys</i>

01:18:09.206 --> 01:18:11.251
that were on the sport page
every Sunday.

01:18:11.774 --> 01:18:16.126
So when Jackie came in in '47,
he gave me hope.

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:18.519
Well, man, one of these days

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.913
I might be
on the front page like that.

01:18:22.175 --> 01:18:24.612
<i>Brooklyn became Harlem.</i>

01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:29.530
<i>Or that is to say,
it was a place most loved.</i>

01:18:30.662 --> 01:18:34.361
And whether you would ever go
there or not, you knew Brooklyn

01:18:34.535 --> 01:18:36.929
because Jackie Robinson
was there.

01:18:38.626 --> 01:18:41.020
<i>One of the very first times</i>

01:18:41.238 --> 01:18:44.632
<i>that I went to see the game
at Ebbets Field...</i>

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:48.767
First of all,
going on the subway,

01:18:48.941 --> 01:18:53.816
you'd have thought all of Harlem
was heading there.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.994
<i>Everybody I see,
they're bringing along baskets.</i>

01:18:58.255 --> 01:19:01.432
<i>They've got chicken.
It's like a big picnic.</i>

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:04.740
All of Harlem now
is going to Ebbets Field and so,

01:19:04.914 --> 01:19:07.046
you know where they're going,
and you know why they're going.

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.483
Jackie. Everybody's talking
about Jackie.

01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:13.792
<i>Jackie changed people.</i>

01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:16.621
<i>The whole dynamics
of America changed.</i>

01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:20.103
You know, when the Dodgers
began playing on the road...

01:19:22.192 --> 01:19:24.847
you saw tumultuous scenes,
you know, and...

01:19:26.065 --> 01:19:28.285
this was...
There was a first in everything.

01:19:28.807 --> 01:19:31.114
<i>There was an exhibition game
in Georgia.</i>

01:19:31.636 --> 01:19:33.638
<i>This tremendous crowd
of Black people,</i>

01:19:33.812 --> 01:19:35.553
<i>and the Dodgers emerged
from their dugout.</i>

01:19:37.685 --> 01:19:39.775
<i>A big roar of greeting
from the Black crowd.</i>

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.517
<i>The second thing
is booing from the White stands.</i>

01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:47.304
Okay.
Then the third thing happens.

01:19:47.521 --> 01:19:50.960
What's the third thing?
White people begin standing up

01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:53.005
and clapping
to differentiate themselves.

01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:57.183
<i>How many? Hundreds.</i>

01:19:57.357 --> 01:19:58.924
<i>So, who are these people,
you know?</i>

01:19:59.098 --> 01:20:01.884
<i>They're not all hidden
closet progressives, you know.</i>

01:20:02.754 --> 01:20:05.104
<i>So that's a great dynamic
at work there.</i>

01:20:06.236 --> 01:20:08.151
Black and White
took the field together.

01:20:08.891 --> 01:20:11.023
How do you estimate
the meaning of that, you know?

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:15.419
<i>Jackie Robinson not only
opened the doors for baseball,</i>

01:20:15.593 --> 01:20:17.856
<i>but he opened the doors
for a lot of other opportunities</i>

01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:19.640
<i>because he brought to mind</i>

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:22.252
<i>to a lot of predominantly
White businessmen,</i>

01:20:22.426 --> 01:20:24.994
why shouldn't we have
a Black telephone operator?

01:20:25.385 --> 01:20:27.561
Why shouldn't we have
a clerk in our store?

01:20:27.779 --> 01:20:29.041
They didn't understand that,

01:20:29.215 --> 01:20:30.956
until they got to see
Jackie Robinson

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:35.265
producing like
a professional baseball player

01:20:35.439 --> 01:20:37.441
and then projected that
into other areas of life.

01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:40.661
<i>I think Jack
was one of the catalysts</i>

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.272
<i>for the civil rights movement,</i>

01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:44.448
<i>that somehow
he alerted White people</i>

01:20:44.622 --> 01:20:46.929
to the fact of discrimination

01:20:47.103 --> 01:20:49.453
and what the losses
were for the society,

01:20:49.627 --> 01:20:51.629
that you couldn't include
this talent.

01:20:52.195 --> 01:20:53.631
<i>And I think
he made Black people,</i>

01:20:53.805 --> 01:20:55.285
<i>who had been made
to feel inferior,</i>

01:20:55.459 --> 01:20:57.548
<i>feel prouder of themselves.</i>

01:21:00.203 --> 01:21:02.379
<i>Signing him
was remarkable</i>

01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:05.861
<i>because Jackie was not
a great player when he started,</i>

01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:10.866
but every year he improved
and became very exciting,

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.520
<i>and a great second baseman,
and a team leader.</i>

01:21:14.043 --> 01:21:16.872
<i>He just... He did
a great job of pioneering.</i>

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:22.486
But the hostility
to Jackie was very, very strong.

01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:27.621
<i>And now, the Cardinals
were probably the most hostile.</i>

01:21:28.361 --> 01:21:31.712
<i>And I saw Enos Slaughter
run down</i>

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:35.891
<i>and just deliberately reach out
with his left foot</i>

01:21:36.108 --> 01:21:40.243
<i>and spike
Jackie Robinson's ankle.</i>

01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:43.855
<i>The things
that happened on the ball field</i>

01:21:44.029 --> 01:21:46.466
<i>hurt more than anything else,
simply because of the fact</i>

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.860
<i>that I had been in athletics
for many, many years,</i>

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:51.950
<i>and I had never really
experienced some of the things</i>

01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:54.126
<i>that were happening to me
at this particular time.</i>

01:21:54.474 --> 01:21:57.260
<i>So Mr. Rickey felt that
for the first few years</i>

01:21:57.434 --> 01:22:00.306
<i>that we couldn't oppose
actually some of the things</i>

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:01.873
<i>that were said and done to us.</i>

01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:04.136
<i>We had to sort of turn
the other cheek.</i>

01:22:04.832 --> 01:22:06.704
<i>I found that very difficult.
Matter of fact,</i>

01:22:06.878 --> 01:22:08.532
<i>my doctor told me
to get away from baseball</i>

01:22:08.706 --> 01:22:10.534
<i>for fear I was gonna
have a nervous breakdown.</i>

01:22:12.492 --> 01:22:13.929
<i>I knew
what he was going through,</i>

01:22:14.103 --> 01:22:15.974
and I could hear it
in certain cities,

01:22:16.366 --> 01:22:18.629
like Philadelphia and Baltimore,

01:22:18.803 --> 01:22:21.023
some of the places
where there would be

01:22:21.197 --> 01:22:22.807
racial epithets coming
out of the stands

01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:23.939
and that kind of thing.

01:22:24.548 --> 01:22:26.158
<i>And I would...
It would make me angry.</i>

01:22:26.332 --> 01:22:27.899
<i>But I was just as committed
to the course</i>

01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:29.770
<i>that Jack had chosen, as he was,</i>

01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:32.164
<i>and he would fight back
with his bat.</i>

01:22:32.338 --> 01:22:33.861
<i>I mean, he would do well,</i>

01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:37.039
<i>and that would silence
those detractors.</i>

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:40.738
<i>In that pressure cooker
of that first year,</i>

01:22:40.912 --> 01:22:44.002
<i>he still was Rookie of the Year,
and they won the pennant,</i>

01:22:46.004 --> 01:22:48.441
which has to be
the most incredible,

01:22:48.615 --> 01:22:50.966
courageous feat in the history
of American sports.

01:22:52.532 --> 01:22:54.970
<i>Just look at this,
and think about Jackie Robinson.</i>

01:22:55.361 --> 01:22:58.103
<i>Dark-skinned Black man
puts on a white uniform,</i>

01:22:58.277 --> 01:22:59.844
<i>picks up a bat
made of white ash,</i>

01:23:00.149 --> 01:23:01.802
<i>stands in a white batter's box</i>

01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.804
<i>to hit a white baseball
from a White pitcher...</i>

01:23:05.415 --> 01:23:06.851
<i>...thrown over
a white home plate,</i>

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:09.680
<i>hits the ball
between two white foul lines.</i>

01:23:10.202 --> 01:23:12.552
<i>He's called "out" or "safe"
by a White umpire,</i>

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:14.511
<i>as White fans boo or cheer.</i>

01:23:15.816 --> 01:23:17.079
He was an ink spot

01:23:17.253 --> 01:23:18.384
on the white canvas
of injustice.

01:23:18.732 --> 01:23:22.040
And so, no matter
how you feel...

01:23:22.475 --> 01:23:25.696
...he was under
a tremendous pressure...

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.220
to try to blend in.

01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.624
<i>All those that I talked to
or was around were very excited</i>

01:23:40.798 --> 01:23:43.061
<i>about the Negroes
breaking into the Majors,</i>

01:23:43.235 --> 01:23:46.543
<i>you know,
which I myself was, in a way,</i>

01:23:46.717 --> 01:23:49.024
<i>except that it did wreck
our business.</i>

01:23:49.198 --> 01:23:52.549
<i>And I do feel
it was an unfair approach.</i>

01:23:52.897 --> 01:23:55.943
<i>I feel that it should have been
handled much differently.</i>

01:23:56.596 --> 01:24:00.557
Black executives
of Negro Leagues teams

01:24:00.774 --> 01:24:05.083
were on board with integration
in the sense that they believed

01:24:05.257 --> 01:24:07.912
that integration in baseball

01:24:08.086 --> 01:24:09.914
would mean integration
in all of society,

01:24:10.088 --> 01:24:12.656
that Black people would
ultimately become "equals,"

01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:14.092
if you will.

01:24:14.484 --> 01:24:16.007
I'm not even gonna say
that they were opposed

01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:19.663
to integration in baseball

01:24:19.837 --> 01:24:24.146
in terms of its effect
potentially on their teams.

01:24:24.711 --> 01:24:26.844
You know, whether they might
lose some of their best teams.

01:24:27.018 --> 01:24:29.890
You know, once Jackie was signed
away from the Monarchs,

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.762
you know, they understood

01:24:31.936 --> 01:24:33.068
that their players
could be next.

01:24:33.242 --> 01:24:34.547
In fact,
their players were next.

01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:35.722
I don't even think

01:24:35.896 --> 01:24:37.550
they were really
opposed to that.

01:24:37.942 --> 01:24:39.465
The conflict came in

01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:41.902
because they wanted
to be treated fairly

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:43.469
as businessmen and women.

01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:46.516
<i>Even Cum Posey
was an advocate,</i>

01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:47.952
<i>before he died,</i>

01:24:48.387 --> 01:24:50.346
<i>of integration.</i>

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.738
He would give speeches
and he would say,

01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:53.392
I hope to, you know,

01:24:53.827 --> 01:24:56.047
eventually see Black players
playing in the Major Leagues.

01:24:56.656 --> 01:24:58.963
But it was always
with the expectation that the...

01:24:59.137 --> 01:25:02.314
that the Negro League teams
would be compensated,

01:25:02.923 --> 01:25:04.360
that if they jumped

01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:06.666
from the Negro Leagues
to a pro-team,

01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.407
that the pro-team
would essentially

01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:11.932
do what they would do,
you know...

01:25:12.585 --> 01:25:13.847
...amongst themselves,

01:25:14.065 --> 01:25:15.458
which are,
they would buy out the contract.

01:25:15.980 --> 01:25:18.635
<i>Branch Rickey opposed that
from the very beginning.</i>

01:25:18.809 --> 01:25:21.986
<i>In fact, he mocked the idea</i>

01:25:22.204 --> 01:25:25.337
<i>that Jackie Robinson
had any contractual obligation</i>

01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:26.991
<i>to the Kansas City Monarchs,</i>

01:25:27.513 --> 01:25:29.776
<i>or that the Negro Leagues
were even a real league.</i>

01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:31.517
<i>He said they're not even
a real league.</i>

01:25:32.170 --> 01:25:36.435
Branch Rickey didn't even ask...
He accused Dad of being...

01:25:37.828 --> 01:25:40.309
And the Negro Leagues
were ran by a bunch of gamblers.

01:25:40.483 --> 01:25:41.788
I don't know where he got...

01:25:41.962 --> 01:25:43.790
Well, there was one guy
in the East Coast,

01:25:43.964 --> 01:25:46.358
was in the number business,
but that's the only guy

01:25:46.532 --> 01:25:48.099
I ever heard of being
into gambl...

01:25:48.273 --> 01:25:50.319
But he used that
mainly as an excuse,

01:25:50.493 --> 01:25:51.929
so they wouldn't have
to pay him.

01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:54.410
But Branch Rickey
never paid anything,

01:25:54.888 --> 01:25:56.368
really, to anybody.

01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:59.676
He was a very close-operating,
cheap person.

01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:03.375
<i>He knew how
the baseball business worked.</i>

01:26:03.593 --> 01:26:05.812
<i>Here are these players
that you have invested in</i>

01:26:05.986 --> 01:26:07.945
<i>that you have trained,
that you have developed.</i>

01:26:08.119 --> 01:26:11.035
<i>Now, I want them to play
on my Major League roster.</i>

01:26:11.209 --> 01:26:13.124
<i>Here is what it should cost me.</i>

01:26:14.081 --> 01:26:17.215
<i>But Jackie Robinson signed
with the Dodgers,</i>

01:26:17.650 --> 01:26:21.263
<i>and Branch Rickey did not pay
the Monarchs for his contract.</i>

01:26:21.524 --> 01:26:24.440
<i>And later, Branch Rickey
signed Roy Campanella</i>

01:26:24.614 --> 01:26:26.224
<i>and did not pay Tom Wilson</i>

01:26:26.398 --> 01:26:28.183
<i>of the Baltimore Elite Giants
for his contract.</i>

01:26:28.357 --> 01:26:29.967
<i>And he signed Don Newcombe,</i>

01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:32.665
<i>and he didn't pay Effa and Abe
for his contract.</i>

01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:34.885
So there was this understanding

01:26:35.059 --> 01:26:36.887
that, not only
was integration happening,

01:26:37.061 --> 01:26:39.542
but it was going
to kill their businesses.

01:26:40.064 --> 01:26:43.328
<i>I never felt he was right
to take those valuable players</i>

01:26:43.502 --> 01:26:44.982
<i>and not give us
a nickel for them.</i>

01:26:45.156 --> 01:26:47.071
<i>I felt that was very wrong,</i>

01:26:47.811 --> 01:26:50.683
<i>and we should have had
some little compensation.</i>

01:26:50.857 --> 01:26:54.209
<i>But we were in no position
to protest, and he knew it.</i>

01:26:54.383 --> 01:26:56.863
<i>So he just completely
outmaneuvered us,</i>

01:26:57.647 --> 01:27:01.085
<i>outsmarted us,
or just plain raped us.</i>

01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:04.349
<i>I don't know what you'd say
or how you'd describe it.</i>

01:27:04.654 --> 01:27:07.396
Bob K: <i>To say that Effa Manley
couldn't stand Branch Rickey</i>

01:27:07.570 --> 01:27:09.049
<i>might be an understatement.</i>

01:27:09.528 --> 01:27:10.964
She didn't care
for Branch Rickey

01:27:11.138 --> 01:27:12.836
because she saw what Branch
was going to do,

01:27:13.445 --> 01:27:16.970
<i>and she was able
to kind of fight him off.</i>

01:27:18.668 --> 01:27:21.714
<i>But she knew she wasn't gonna
be able to continue to hold</i>

01:27:21.932 --> 01:27:25.109
<i>those other owners off
once this thing did break loose.</i>

01:27:25.457 --> 01:27:27.503
As we say,
there was blood in the water,

01:27:27.938 --> 01:27:29.635
and the sharks were coming out.

01:27:32.029 --> 01:27:33.596
<i>At this point,</i>

01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:35.772
<i>Jackie's establishing himself
with the Dodgers</i>

01:27:35.946 --> 01:27:37.469
<i>in the National League.</i>

01:27:37.904 --> 01:27:40.298
<i>Bill Veeck, from Cleveland,
had called and told Effa</i>

01:27:40.472 --> 01:27:42.300
<i>that he wanted
to sign Larry Doby,</i>

01:27:42.648 --> 01:27:44.781
<i>and immediately,</i>

01:27:44.955 --> 01:27:47.740
<i>I think Effa's probably
just happy she got a call</i>

01:27:47.914 --> 01:27:49.176
because she didn't get a call

01:27:49.351 --> 01:27:50.917
from Branch Rickey
for Don Newcombe.

01:27:51.178 --> 01:27:53.529
So already she understands,

01:27:53.703 --> 01:27:57.184
okay, he is at least trying
to do business with me.

01:27:58.055 --> 01:28:00.318
And he makes it clear that
he wants to sign Larry Doby.

01:28:00.492 --> 01:28:02.712
And she says, "Okay, well,
how much will you give me?"

01:28:02.886 --> 01:28:04.975
<i>So Bill Veeck,</i>

01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:06.759
<i>the owner
of the Cleveland Indians,</i>

01:28:06.933 --> 01:28:09.588
<i>offered 10,000 dollars
for Larry Doby's contract.</i>

01:28:09.806 --> 01:28:11.329
It wasn't a lot of money,

01:28:11.721 --> 01:28:12.939
but it was a whole lot more
than anybody else was paying.

01:28:13.592 --> 01:28:17.074
And Effa said,
"You know, Mr. Veeck,

01:28:17.248 --> 01:28:19.032
<i>if he were White
and a free agent,</i>

01:28:19.206 --> 01:28:21.121
<i>you could get
100,000 dollars for him."</i>

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.254
And Veeck says,
"Well, yeah, you're right.

01:28:23.428 --> 01:28:24.734
I'll tell you what.

01:28:24.908 --> 01:28:25.996
If he sticks with the team
for a month,

01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:27.737
I'll pay you another five."

01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:29.521
I think that made her
tremendously important.

01:28:29.695 --> 01:28:33.003
A woman in a man's space,
speaking up and running a team,

01:28:33.177 --> 01:28:35.614
but also a woman
in a man's space saying,

01:28:35.788 --> 01:28:36.920
"Run me my money."

01:28:38.138 --> 01:28:41.098
<i>So Bill Veeck
brings in Larry Doby.</i>

01:28:41.664 --> 01:28:44.275
<i>He also will bring in
Satchel Paige.</i>

01:28:44.928 --> 01:28:47.757
<i>Paige is pretty old
by that time,</i>

01:28:48.279 --> 01:28:49.759
but he comes in,

01:28:50.281 --> 01:28:54.111
he sets attendance records
in his first three games,

01:28:54.285 --> 01:28:55.852
and he can still pitch.

01:28:56.026 --> 01:28:57.854
Announcer 1: <i>Lou Boudreau
goes to the mound,</i>

01:28:58.028 --> 01:28:59.508
<i>that's all for Christopher
and it's gonna be Satchel Paige.</i>

01:28:59.682 --> 01:29:01.336
<i>And here's the announcement</i>

01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:03.381
<i>about the appearance
of Satchel Paige. Listen.</i>

01:29:03.555 --> 01:29:05.296
Announcer 2: <i>Satchel Paige!</i>

01:29:08.386 --> 01:29:09.648
<i>And he will pitch in relief,</i>

01:29:09.822 --> 01:29:11.433
<i>he will pitch
in the World Series,</i>

01:29:11.607 --> 01:29:13.043
<i>and the Indians will win.</i>

01:29:21.878 --> 01:29:24.881
<i>That was the death knell
of Negro League Baseball.</i>

01:29:26.752 --> 01:29:28.232
<i>When they signed
the Black players,</i>

01:29:28.406 --> 01:29:30.147
<i>the people that had been coming</i>

01:29:30.321 --> 01:29:33.803
<i>to Griffith Stadium
in Washington to see us play,</i>

01:29:33.977 --> 01:29:36.458
<i>and in Yankee Stadium
to see us play,</i>

01:29:37.154 --> 01:29:40.113
now, they want
to see Jackie play.

01:29:41.245 --> 01:29:42.899
<i>The interest
in the Negro League</i>

01:29:43.073 --> 01:29:44.596
<i>really fell off.</i>

01:29:44.901 --> 01:29:46.642
<i>So they found out
that they couldn't continue</i>

01:29:46.816 --> 01:29:48.121
<i>to pay the salaries.</i>

01:29:48.295 --> 01:29:50.254
<i>And, you know,
all those favorite fans</i>

01:29:50.428 --> 01:29:54.389
<i>now were going to see players
that had just been called up.</i>

01:29:56.303 --> 01:29:57.740
<i>Integration took place,</i>

01:29:57.914 --> 01:30:01.613
<i>and I begged Abe to quit
the next year</i>

01:30:01.787 --> 01:30:04.442
<i>because we dropped
another 20,000 dollars.</i>

01:30:04.616 --> 01:30:06.096
<i>I mean, the fans deserted us</i>

01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:08.446
<i>to go see the boys
on the White team.</i>

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:12.450
<i>Deserted us like they say
rats desert a ship.[chuckling]</i>

01:30:15.061 --> 01:30:16.367
Bob M: <i>With the onset
of integration</i>

01:30:16.541 --> 01:30:18.151
<i>in the great American pastime,</i>

01:30:19.065 --> 01:30:21.067
<i>the once-prosperous
Negro National League</i>

01:30:21.241 --> 01:30:24.070
<i>in the East folded in 1948.</i>

01:30:24.854 --> 01:30:27.334
<i>Only the Negro American League
in the Midwest was left</i>

01:30:27.509 --> 01:30:30.250
<i>to hold down the fort
of Black baseball.</i>

01:30:32.339 --> 01:30:34.429
<i>So on the East Coast primarily</i>

01:30:34.603 --> 01:30:38.302
<i>is where you saw
that really quick downfall.</i>

01:30:38.476 --> 01:30:40.391
<i>Effa called it
"Jackie Robinson Country"</i>

01:30:40.565 --> 01:30:42.828
because where she was playing
in Newark, like, you know,

01:30:43.002 --> 01:30:46.049
her fans could just catch
a train and go see Jackie.

01:30:46.266 --> 01:30:48.834
<i>When people have one option,
or you know,</i>

01:30:49.008 --> 01:30:50.445
<i>they don't have money
to go to multiple games,</i>

01:30:50.619 --> 01:30:52.272
<i>they're choosing
to go see Jackie.</i>

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:54.579
<i>Why am I going to go see
the segregated ballclub</i>

01:30:54.753 --> 01:30:56.407
<i>that was born of Jim Crow</i>

01:30:56.581 --> 01:30:58.453
<i>and represent segregation
and all of these things,</i>

01:30:58.627 --> 01:31:00.890
<i>when I can go see Jackie?
He's the hope. He's the future.</i>

01:31:04.154 --> 01:31:05.982
One of the questions
I get asked all the time

01:31:06.156 --> 01:31:09.202
about integration is,
"Layton, wasn't it wonderful

01:31:09.376 --> 01:31:12.118
that when Jackie Robinson
got called up,

01:31:12.292 --> 01:31:15.731
that it opened up baseball
for all the Black ballplayers?"

01:31:16.122 --> 01:31:18.342
And I said, "If you talk
to the ballplayers themselves,

01:31:18.516 --> 01:31:19.691
the answer is no."

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.825
Is... If you were
an impact ballplayer

01:31:22.999 --> 01:31:25.828
<i>like Larry Doby,
or Roy Campanella,</i>

01:31:26.002 --> 01:31:28.744
<i>or Don Newcombe,
or a Jackie Robinson,</i>

01:31:28.918 --> 01:31:30.310
<i>there was gonna be a chance</i>

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:32.051
that you could play
in organized baseball.

01:31:32.225 --> 01:31:34.750
But for the average
Negro League ballplayer, no.

01:31:35.446 --> 01:31:39.102
<i>I knew that everybody
couldn't be the same</i>

01:31:39.276 --> 01:31:41.583
<i>and be that at the same time.</i>

01:31:42.105 --> 01:31:44.411
It's a lack of opportunities,
that's all.

01:31:45.848 --> 01:31:47.327
<i>But we had ballplayers</i>

01:31:47.502 --> 01:31:48.764
<i>that could have played
in the Major Leagues</i>

01:31:48.938 --> 01:31:50.809
<i>when they first started playing.</i>

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:52.855
<i>But they didn't get the chance.</i>

01:31:54.247 --> 01:31:55.684
<i>Willie Wells,</i>

01:31:56.206 --> 01:31:58.208
<i>there ain't no baseball player
in Major League Baseball,</i>

01:31:58.382 --> 01:32:00.645
no better ballplayer
shortstop than Willie Wells.

01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:04.475
Raymond Dandridge...
...Josh Gibson.

01:32:06.129 --> 01:32:08.566
<i>Josh Gibson
was always in the conversation</i>

01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:10.742
<i>about this vision some day</i>

01:32:10.916 --> 01:32:12.439
<i>of Black players playing
in the Major Leagues</i>

01:32:12.962 --> 01:32:14.746
<i>because, by the mid-1930s,</i>

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.356
<i>he was considered
the greatest hitter</i>

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:17.749
<i>in Black baseball,</i>

01:32:18.054 --> 01:32:19.142
and people who had seen him play
would say, like,

01:32:19.316 --> 01:32:21.144
"He's greater than Babe Ruth."

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:23.407
<i>But in fact,
Wendell Smith himself,</i>

01:32:23.581 --> 01:32:25.540
<i>and some of the other
top Black sportswriters,</i>

01:32:25.714 --> 01:32:31.023
<i>had actually stopped advocating
for Josh Gibson by the 1940s</i>

01:32:31.197 --> 01:32:33.330
<i>because they thought
he had too many demons.</i>

01:32:33.678 --> 01:32:34.897
<i>According to the family,</i>

01:32:35.375 --> 01:32:37.987
<i>Josh was diagnosed
with a brain tumor.</i>

01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:41.556
<i>And it took a toll on him,
physically and mentally.</i>

01:32:42.382 --> 01:32:45.734
<i>He lost his sense
of who he was and control</i>

01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:48.998
<i>and was found wandering
around the streets of San Juan.</i>

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:52.741
<i>And he passed
not long after that.</i>

01:32:53.698 --> 01:32:57.963
<i>And it was a very,
very sad ending for someone who,</i>

01:32:58.137 --> 01:32:59.617
<i>anybody who saw him play,</i>

01:32:59.791 --> 01:33:01.184
<i>said this was one
of the greatest players</i>

01:33:01.358 --> 01:33:02.446
<i>who ever played the game.</i>

01:33:08.974 --> 01:33:10.672
There were still
attempts to keep going,

01:33:10.846 --> 01:33:12.499
to keep playing.
And even into the '50s,

01:33:12.674 --> 01:33:14.676
there were some players
that were being recruited.

01:33:15.111 --> 01:33:17.113
<i>Henry Aaron was playing
on a Black team</i>

01:33:17.287 --> 01:33:18.767
<i>when he was recruited,</i>

01:33:19.115 --> 01:33:22.379
<i>and we saw all kinds of efforts
to bring in more ticket sales,</i>

01:33:22.553 --> 01:33:24.642
<i>like the signing of women
to play games.</i>

01:33:26.775 --> 01:33:29.081
<i>There's good baseball
being played by Negro Leaguers,</i>

01:33:29.255 --> 01:33:33.695
<i>and the league itself
persists down to 1960.</i>

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:38.569
But it's not anywhere near
the quality of baseball played

01:33:38.743 --> 01:33:40.702
when the Negro Leagues
were at their height.

01:33:45.010 --> 01:33:46.621
<i>I don't know
if it was apparent at first,</i>

01:33:46.795 --> 01:33:49.536
<i>but I think over time the loss
of the Negro Leagues</i>

01:33:49.711 --> 01:33:52.322
<i>began to be more felt,</i>

01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:54.324
and that people began
to understand

01:33:54.498 --> 01:33:55.673
that the loss
of the Negro Leagues

01:33:55.847 --> 01:33:57.719
was something significant.

01:33:59.024 --> 01:34:02.724
<i>It was felt in many ways
that were tangible.</i>

01:34:02.985 --> 01:34:05.422
<i>You know, when we start talking
about all of the people</i>

01:34:05.596 --> 01:34:07.337
<i>that it takes
to make a team run,</i>

01:34:07.511 --> 01:34:10.122
<i>whether we're talking
about bus drivers, or, you know,</i>

01:34:10.296 --> 01:34:12.516
<i>people working concessions
or taking tickets,</i>

01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:14.474
all of those people
typically came

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:16.172
from within
that Black community.

01:34:17.695 --> 01:34:19.958
<i>But then,
there's also the intangible,</i>

01:34:20.132 --> 01:34:22.004
<i>of in the midst
of all of the stuff</i>

01:34:22.178 --> 01:34:24.746
<i>that we have to deal with
as Black people in this society,</i>

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:26.312
<i>this place where we can go,</i>

01:34:26.486 --> 01:34:28.140
<i>where we can get dressed
to the nines,</i>

01:34:28.314 --> 01:34:29.881
<i>where we can hang out,</i>

01:34:30.055 --> 01:34:31.666
<i>where we can root
for our favorite players</i>

01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:35.017
and are free to just be us
without the White gaze.

01:34:35.191 --> 01:34:36.366
They lost that too.

01:34:37.976 --> 01:34:40.979
<i>What happened
was starting in the '50s,</i>

01:34:41.153 --> 01:34:43.199
<i>a lot of the Black folks,</i>

01:34:43.373 --> 01:34:45.941
<i>who had the opportunity
to leave those communities</i>

01:34:46.115 --> 01:34:49.771
to go to college, to rise
within White professions,

01:34:49.945 --> 01:34:53.122
did so, and they left

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:55.907
<i>folks who were stuck
in those communities</i>

01:34:56.081 --> 01:34:57.561
<i>to be on their own</i>

01:34:57.996 --> 01:34:59.737
<i>at a time when they were
more vulnerable than ever,</i>

01:35:00.346 --> 01:35:02.914
<i>as a result
of the declining industries,</i>

01:35:03.088 --> 01:35:06.526
<i>as a result of the devastating
impact of urban renewal.</i>

01:35:07.136 --> 01:35:10.139
<i>These housing projects
and highway projects.</i>

01:35:10.617 --> 01:35:13.664
<i>So the demise
of the Negro Leagues</i>

01:35:13.969 --> 01:35:17.537
<i>foreshadows a larger crisis</i>

01:35:17.712 --> 01:35:19.931
<i>for Black America
in those communities.</i>

01:35:21.324 --> 01:35:23.195
<i>You look at just
the Crawford Grill</i>

01:35:23.369 --> 01:35:27.069
<i>and across the street
is a Black barbershop.</i>

01:35:27.417 --> 01:35:28.940
<i>And it's fascinating</i>

01:35:29.114 --> 01:35:31.769
<i>after the integration
of Major Leagues,</i>

01:35:32.074 --> 01:35:34.859
<i>you see the deterioration.</i>

01:35:36.643 --> 01:35:40.560
It's just devastating
to the Black community.

01:35:42.475 --> 01:35:44.216
Bob K: <i>When we talk
about integration,</i>

01:35:44.434 --> 01:35:49.134
<i>it was good morally,
it was good socially,</i>

01:35:49.787 --> 01:35:51.441
<i>and it moved us in ways</i>

01:35:51.615 --> 01:35:54.357
<i>in which we probably never,
ever dreamed possible.</i>

01:35:55.967 --> 01:35:58.535
But that progress
came at a cost.

01:36:02.757 --> 01:36:06.673
<i>The enduring importance
of the Negro Leagues is the fact</i>

01:36:06.848 --> 01:36:09.285
<i>that we can do this thing
on our own.</i>

01:36:09.459 --> 01:36:10.982
I'm not saying we should.

01:36:11.156 --> 01:36:13.071
I'm not saying that
we should go off in a corner

01:36:13.245 --> 01:36:15.160
and, you know,
build our own teams and leagues

01:36:15.334 --> 01:36:17.946
and recreate
Negro Leagues baseball.

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:19.164
But we can.

01:36:20.035 --> 01:36:23.865
<i>We know, and White baseball
should know as well,</i>

01:36:24.039 --> 01:36:26.868
<i>that we're capable
'cause we already did the thing.</i>

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:31.133
<i>Boom.
Out toward straight center.</i>

01:36:31.437 --> 01:36:34.963
<i>Willie Mays catches it,
450 feet.</i>

01:36:35.137 --> 01:36:37.704
<i>Say, hey, Willie,
was that a catch!</i>

01:36:37.879 --> 01:36:40.272
<i>Would baseball
be baseball today</i>

01:36:40.446 --> 01:36:42.797
<i>without Willie Mays
from the Birmingham Black Barons</i>

01:36:43.275 --> 01:36:46.017
<i>or Ernie Banks
from the Kansas City Monarchs?</i>

01:36:48.846 --> 01:36:52.241
The Negro Leagues brought
a new dynamic to the game.

01:36:52.415 --> 01:36:54.765
It made the game
a better version of itself.

01:36:55.026 --> 01:36:56.811
<i>By the '60s and '70s,</i>

01:36:57.028 --> 01:36:59.161
<i>guys who had not played
in the Negro Leagues</i>

01:36:59.639 --> 01:37:03.339
<i>come on the scene in what really
was the heyday of Black baseball</i>

01:37:03.513 --> 01:37:04.993
<i>in the Majors.</i>

01:37:05.167 --> 01:37:06.690
<i>Hank Robinson
jockeys the count</i>

01:37:06.864 --> 01:37:07.952
<i>to three and two,
before he gets his pitch</i>

01:37:08.474 --> 01:37:10.476
<i>Players like Frank Robinson</i>

01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:12.652
<i>excelled at every level
of the game.</i>

01:37:12.827 --> 01:37:15.220
<i>Like Rube Foster,
he was a star player,</i>

01:37:15.394 --> 01:37:18.049
<i>a manager,
and a baseball executive.</i>

01:37:18.528 --> 01:37:21.183
<i>Bob Gibson was the greatest
Black pitcher</i>

01:37:21.748 --> 01:37:23.185
<i>since Satchel Paige.</i>

01:37:23.576 --> 01:37:25.970
<i>And Reggie Jackson,
like Josh Gibson,</i>

01:37:26.144 --> 01:37:29.191
<i>who is one of the most feared
sluggers in baseball history.</i>

01:37:31.193 --> 01:37:34.239
Black and Latin players made it
a very different game,

01:37:34.413 --> 01:37:36.372
<i>and with their success
on the field,</i>

01:37:36.546 --> 01:37:38.156
<i>there was no turning back.</i>

01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:40.985
<i>Upton steals home!</i>

01:37:41.159 --> 01:37:43.466
Bob M: <i>On April 8th, 1974,</i>

01:37:43.945 --> 01:37:45.555
<i>Hank Aaron broke
Babe Ruth's record,</i>

01:37:45.729 --> 01:37:47.513
<i>one of the most sacred
in baseball,</i>

01:37:47.687 --> 01:37:51.213
<i>hitting his 715th home run
in the Major Leagues.</i>

01:37:51.387 --> 01:37:53.911
<i>Swinging and there's
a drive into left-center field,</i>

01:37:54.085 --> 01:37:56.000
<i>that ball is out of here!</i>

01:37:56.174 --> 01:37:57.784
<i>It's 715,</i>

01:37:58.002 --> 01:38:00.831
<i>there is a new home run champion
of all time,</i>

01:38:01.179 --> 01:38:02.528
<i>and it's Henry Aaron!</i>

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.574
<i>Hank Aaron once said,</i>

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:07.055
<i>"My abilities are only limited
by the lack of opportunity."</i>

01:38:07.316 --> 01:38:08.883
<i>And once he got
that opportunity,</i>

01:38:09.274 --> 01:38:11.320
<i>he made an assault
on Ruth's record.</i>

01:38:11.711 --> 01:38:15.150
<i>Henry Aaron,
the home run king of all time...</i>

01:38:15.324 --> 01:38:16.760
<i>So let's keep in mind</i>

01:38:17.108 --> 01:38:19.284
that Babe Ruth never hit
a home run off a Black pitcher.

01:38:19.458 --> 01:38:21.678
<i>His record was set
in apartheid baseball,</i>

01:38:21.852 --> 01:38:24.594
<i>which makes Hank Aaron's record
more valuable.</i>

01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:26.291
<i>His record was set</i>

01:38:26.465 --> 01:38:28.598
<i>against the best pitchers
on the planet.</i>

01:38:29.686 --> 01:38:31.688
Bob M: <i>Following years
of pressure from the public,</i>

01:38:32.210 --> 01:38:33.733
<i>Satchel Paige
became the first player</i>

01:38:33.908 --> 01:38:36.084
<i>to be inducted
into the Baseball Hall of Fame</i>

01:38:36.258 --> 01:38:38.782
<i>based on his record
in the Negro Leagues.</i>

01:38:39.217 --> 01:38:41.567
I am the proudest man
on Earth right today,

01:38:41.741 --> 01:38:44.396
and I know my wife is.

01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:48.139
Bob M: <i>The following year,</i>

01:38:48.531 --> 01:38:50.446
<i>he was joined by Buck Leonard
and Josh Gibson,</i>

01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:52.491
<i>and then "Cool Papa" Bell.</i>

01:38:52.752 --> 01:38:55.364
<i>Many more would follow,
including Rube Foster,</i>

01:38:55.625 --> 01:38:58.193
<i>Effa Manley,
and Cumberland Posey.</i>

01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.065
<i>It's hard to do
too much for pioneers.</i>

01:39:01.239 --> 01:39:03.372
I think, you know,
we stand on their shoulders,

01:39:03.546 --> 01:39:06.636
and we know it.
They paved the way for us,

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:09.595
<i>and we should have
a lasting gratitude toward them.</i>

01:39:10.901 --> 01:39:13.469
Bob K: <i>The Negro League
players themselves,</i>

01:39:13.773 --> 01:39:15.993
<i>they had no idea
they were making history.</i>

01:39:16.428 --> 01:39:18.735
Man, they didn't care
about making no history.

01:39:18.909 --> 01:39:23.522
They just wanted to play ball.
But the pride, the passion,

01:39:24.349 --> 01:39:26.699
<i>the courage that
they demonstrated</i>

01:39:26.873 --> 01:39:28.701
<i>in the face of adversity.</i>

01:39:29.267 --> 01:39:35.143
<i>To overcome the adversity
transcends race, transcends age,</i>

01:39:35.317 --> 01:39:38.189
<i>transcends gender.
And that's the real story.</i>

01:40:31.677 --> 01:40:32.983
It was in my blood.

01:40:33.244 --> 01:40:35.159
It'’s still in my blood
to be an umpire.

01:40:35.855 --> 01:40:38.684
You call a player safe,
it just get all over ya.

01:40:38.858 --> 01:40:41.426
You call a player out,
it just get all over ya.

01:40:41.731 --> 01:40:43.733
It's just like a... in heaven.
