00:12.200 --> 00:13.760
Rein!

02:01.640 --> 02:04.380
I imagined it would have been bigger.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.590
Because of its value, I suppose.

02:09.600 --> 02:13.470
A painting like this exudes intimacy.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.660
It invites the viewer in.

02:16.680 --> 02:19.270
Delicate brushwork.

02:19.320 --> 02:22.390
Consummate use of light and shade.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.780
The exquisite depth of field.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.350
A timely reminder of
the need for redemption.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.230
Yes.

02:32.280 --> 02:35.670
The worthy few at
the gates of Heaven.

02:35.720 --> 02:39.120
The lost souls, condemned
to damnation.

02:40.640 --> 02:44.710
Really is one of the finest
examples of a Doom painting

02:44.760 --> 02:46.710
ever put to canvas.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.200
1452.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.800
Yes, the artist left his mark.

02:58.760 --> 03:00.310
You clumsy lummox!

03:00.360 --> 03:03.110
Have you any idea
of the value of art?

03:03.160 --> 03:05.670
Ted, that lighting
in there is all wrong.

03:05.720 --> 03:07.950
I want theatre, I want drama.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.750
A celestial milieu to
stimulate the senses.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.510
I'm surrounded by Philistines.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.790
It was very trusting of the Vatican
to lend you the painting.

03:16.840 --> 03:21.030
Ah, it was hidden away
in the Apostolic Archives.

03:21.080 --> 03:24.310
I persuaded a cardinal
to pull some strings.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.630
Oh! As if I don't have
enough to contend with.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.990
What a surprise.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.630
And how did you get in?

03:31.680 --> 03:35.910
Well, I persuaded Mr Cadwaller
to give me a sneak preview.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.110
I am very interested
in this exhibition.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.550
Well, don't tell Felicia. I'll
never hear the end of it.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.870
Yes, well, I've checked
on security arrangements.

03:42.920 --> 03:44.390
Everything seems to be in order.

03:44.440 --> 03:46.350
Well, the Belvedere is fully equipped

03:46.400 --> 03:49.870
with a foolproof alarm system. All
the exhibits are perfectly safe.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.910
I'll be allocating PC Nyland
to keep an eye on things.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.360
Just to put our minds at rest.

03:56.640 --> 03:59.830
I'm never going to open
on time, at this rate.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.550
Perhaps I should leave you to it.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.740
Yes, perhaps you should.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.030
I have an appointment.
Pictura Magazine.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.950
~ Ah.
~ Now, there's the journalist
who's come to interview me,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.430
so I shall see you both
at tomorrow's preview.

04:13.480 --> 04:16.070
~ Sir.
~ It promises to be exclusive.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.110
Binkie Cadwaller.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.829
Museum curator.

04:19.880 --> 04:21.750
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.350
Yes, well, I can only spare you
about 20 minutes, I'm afraid.

04:24.400 --> 04:25.870
Well, let's get on with it then.

04:25.920 --> 04:27.910
Right, well, why don't
we do this in my office?

04:27.960 --> 04:32.270
I imagine you'll want to
take a photograph of me.

04:32.320 --> 04:35.350
It's certainly arousing
plenty of interest.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.140
Yes, and a drain on police resources.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.750
I hear the painting was insured
for a million pounds.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.670
So are Betty Grable's legs.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.910
I know what I'd rather look at.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.750
I don't suppose there's any
chance of a lift back...

04:52.800 --> 04:54.470
to Kembleford?

05:11.360 --> 05:14.870
A good exhibition takes
one on a journey,

05:14.920 --> 05:18.870
stimulates the senses
and educates the mind.

05:18.920 --> 05:20.910
It really is all about the narrative.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.830
We both know the value
of a good story.

05:24.440 --> 05:27.550
Well, I was rather hoping
for a decent spread.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.230
Last month's Pictura piece on Poussin

05:30.280 --> 05:32.990
could, at best, be described
as amateurish.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.790
I like to have an angle.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.910
In fact, I'm thinking
that this article

05:36.960 --> 05:38.790
should be less about the painting,

05:38.840 --> 05:42.310
and more about the man
behind the masterpiece.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.950
Binkie Cadwaller -
what makes him tick?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.670
Well, clearly a woman with taste.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.590
And the slightest hint of an accent?

05:52.640 --> 05:54.310
I was brought up in Germany.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.910
A country very close to my heart.

05:56.960 --> 06:00.750
The simple pleasures of Baden-Baden.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.030
The intimate bierkellers of Hamburg.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.220
Leipzig. Do you know it?

06:07.560 --> 06:10.470
That's a city that I'm not...

06:10.520 --> 06:13.520
not, um, terribly familiar
with, I'm afraid.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.600
Tinted by the grey hues
of Stalinist monotony.

06:20.240 --> 06:22.950
I was hoping that I might
have a look at the painting.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.240
Oh, no, no, I'm afraid you're
going to have to wait.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.830
Security concerns.

06:28.880 --> 06:31.310
It has such an intriguing history.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.870
Rumoured to have fallen into
private hands before the war.

06:34.920 --> 06:38.150
The painting belongs to the Vatican.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.400
I am merely its custodian.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.120
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I really must get on.

06:58.680 --> 07:02.280
Are you quite sure it was him?
Your eyesight isn't what it was.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.360
I think I can still manage
to see across the street.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.470
Someone has only gone and
nicked my sparkplugs.

07:10.520 --> 07:13.190
I'm going to have to call the
railway station now, because

07:13.240 --> 07:15.510
the Rolls is out of action
and Her Ladyship is turning

07:15.560 --> 07:17.110
up on the 3.15 train.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.430
If I were you, I would
go to the police.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.310
They'd only accuse me
of wasting their time.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.390
He knew I was there.
He was taunting me.

07:23.440 --> 07:27.280
If Flambeau's decided to show his
face, that can only mean trouble.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.400
Did you just say Flambeau?

07:31.840 --> 07:34.070
The Father claims to have seen him.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.110
Outside the Belvedere Museum.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.510
Well, you know what that means.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.150
Yes.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.670
He wants to steal the painting.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.390
It's awfully kind of
you to offer me a lift.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.830
Pleasure's all mine.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.670
I left His Lordship up
on the grouse moors.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.390
He likes to shoot things.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.350
In that case, I'm glad he's not here.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.430
I'm all alone in this
big empty house.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.430
I'd never leave a beautiful
woman to her own devices.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.550
You're nearly as fast
as your driving.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.830
I don't make a habit
of picking up strangers.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.430
In my case, I'm glad you did.

08:24.480 --> 08:27.030
So what brings you to Kembleford?

08:27.080 --> 08:29.550
I'm over in England to
paint some landscapes.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.670
~ An artist?
~ I dabble.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.830
It makes a welcome change
from the oil business.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.350
I'm attending a preview at
the Belvedere, tomorrow.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.630
Curator's a friend of mine.

08:38.679 --> 08:42.190
~ Religious art, it's not your thing?
~ On the contrary,

08:42.240 --> 08:43.710
religious art is my forte.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.230
I'd be delighted if
you came as my guest.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.950
Then I'd be delighted to escort you.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.830
~ Thank you, Hornby.
~ My Lady.

08:53.880 --> 08:57.710
Lounge suits and summer frocks.
We're very informal.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.310
I'll swing by and pick you up.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.630
Shall we say 2.30?

09:00.680 --> 09:04.270
~ I don't even know your name.
~ Charles Coiner the Third.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.320
Friends call me Chip.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.910
And when exactly is Flambeau
planning to steal this painting?

09:22.960 --> 09:24.670
Tomorrow afternoon. At the preview.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.150
~ In front of all those guests?
~ Well, Flambeau likes a challenge.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.190
~ Impossible.
~ Implausible.

09:30.240 --> 09:33.470
I'm expected to brief my men
over an impending art heist,

09:33.520 --> 09:36.550
based on a half-baked hunch?

09:36.600 --> 09:39.070
That just about sums it up, yes.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.270
Why are you sharing this information?

09:42.320 --> 09:45.630
Because the church owns the painting.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.710
I have a vested interest.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.990
I came this close to
catching him last time.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.670
If I remember rightly,
you helped him get away.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.750
That's not quite how I remember it.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.350
I'd go as far as aiding and abetting.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.340
Sorry, sir. Thought
you should see this.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.720
You've raised your concerns.
We'll take it from here.

10:12.680 --> 10:16.350
Mirren McConnell - released
on licence from Winsome Green.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.870
'How is he my problem?'

10:17.920 --> 10:20.150
'Failed to liaise with
his probation officer.'

10:20.200 --> 10:22.790
~ Seems he's gone to ground, sir.
~ Well, hand it down to uniform.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.980
It's his past form, sir.

10:30.240 --> 10:33.150
Sergeant, get some reinforcements
down to the Belvedere right away.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.150
All weekend leave is cancelled.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.300
I want a car posted outside
through the night.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.230
Perhaps if we were working together?

10:42.280 --> 10:45.190
If Flambeau makes an appearance,
we'll be there to apprehend him,

10:45.240 --> 10:46.790
and you won't be anywhere in sight.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.870
I'll have you taken
off the guest list.

10:48.920 --> 10:51.550
He gives you information, you
throw it back in his face.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.110
If either of you set foot in
that museum tomorrow, I'll have

10:54.160 --> 10:57.100
you arrested for
obstruction, understood?

11:02.040 --> 11:03.870
So we're just supposed to sit around

11:03.920 --> 11:06.350
and let Flambeau run rings
around them, are we?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.270
Mirren McConnell.
Name ring any bells?

11:08.320 --> 11:12.390
They call him The Spark. Wires,
explosives, alarms - he's your man.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.670
Scar from his ear to his chin.

11:14.720 --> 11:18.120
So, Flambeau may well have
found himself an accomplice.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.240
Back in the morning.
Bright and early.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.380
I'm on the press list.
Rebecca Himelbaum.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.550
I don't know how I ever
let you talk me into this.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.070
You didn't take much convincing.

12:56.560 --> 12:58.230
Bishop Talbot.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.380
And the Dowager...
Duchess of Worcester.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.420
I'm afraid I left my
tickets in the car.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.990
Your spectacles, ma'am.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.590
Oh, thank you, Carter.

13:11.640 --> 13:14.740
I shall require these
to admire the paintings.

13:15.680 --> 13:18.480
Until then, you carry
them, young man.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.750
Are you quite sure the
bishop is indisposed?

13:26.800 --> 13:29.140
Tied up at a synod in London.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.310
That ring better come
off. It was Mother's.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.710
She must have had big hands.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.500
Oi-oi, look out.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.510
Lies and deceit.

13:47.560 --> 13:50.660
We have descended to
Flambeau's level already.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.790
~ Mr Coiner is in the petroleum business.
~ Oh, crude oil?

13:57.840 --> 13:59.350
You make me sound so vulgar.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.030
On the contrary, he's something
of an art connoisseur.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.150
Yes, well, the Old Masters
have had their day.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.200
Pop art is the future.

14:08.960 --> 14:13.110
Bright young things like
Paolozzi and Rauschenberg.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.430
Perhaps you should advise
me on a good investment.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.070
Binkie's expert eye has
proved rather lucrative.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.800
Champagne, madame, monsieur.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.950
Thank you.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.990
I hear your latest acquisition
is quite valuable.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.750
No wonder security's tight.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.070
Listen, perhaps I should go and
liaise with Inspector Sullivan.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.670
Excuse me.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.830
I'm in safe hands.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.070
An exhibition to remember.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.990
I'll drink to that.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.910
I've got officers posted
throughout the museum.

14:45.960 --> 14:48.360
Based on a spurious tip-off.

14:51.280 --> 14:54.480
My openings have always
been fondly remembered.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.040
We wouldn't want to lower
the tone, now, would we?

14:59.200 --> 15:00.740
Yes, Jemima.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.350
~ Stake out the lobby, sergeant.
~ Yes, sir.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.630
Oh, and, Goodfellow,

15:07.680 --> 15:09.190
try and blend in.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.640
Yes, sir!

15:29.680 --> 15:32.470
Certainly takes the breath away.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.560
Uh... I've always found
it rather dark.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.710
Trial and retribution.

15:39.760 --> 15:43.040
The blinking of an eye
between time and eternity.

15:45.280 --> 15:48.380
The moment a soul's fate
is sealed forever.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.590
A consummate assessment.

15:51.640 --> 15:54.240
I learned about art from my father.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.110
Do you think the guilty
ever pay for their sins?

15:58.160 --> 16:01.160
I think you know my answer
to that question.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.510
I saw you arrive yesterday.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.840
How is the article on
Mr Cadwaller shaping up?

16:08.120 --> 16:11.620
Oh, it will be enlightening,
I can promise you that.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.580
A fitting obituary
to a colourful career.

16:22.640 --> 16:25.070
No sign of him so far.
Maybe he got cold feet.

16:25.120 --> 16:28.390
As I said to Her Majesty
only last Tuesday,

16:28.440 --> 16:31.040
the monarchy is safe in your hands.

16:32.760 --> 16:37.190
I am often called upon
to offer discreet advice,

16:37.240 --> 16:40.550
as a redoubtable stalwart
of the peerage.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.230
Are we perhaps getting
a bit carried away?

16:43.280 --> 16:46.480
Listen, I'm going to go
and look for McConnell.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.150
Well, I don't think
much of the paintings.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.340
Far too much naked flesh.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.180
I think we should concentrate
on the matter in hand.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.960
Now, he strikes me as
a very likely suspect.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.790
I think that's the
mayor, Mrs McCarthy.

17:06.839 --> 17:10.630
And I think you told me Flambeau
is a master of disguise.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.670
Oh, don't you worry, Father.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.589
Nothing gets past me.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.030
Father Brown! I wondered
where you'd got to.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.670
That's all we need.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.710
Lady Felicia.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.950
~ How was Scotland?
~ Rather weird.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.270
You simply have to meet a new
friend of mine. He's American.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.430
Oh, he was here a moment ago.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.790
Excuse me.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.780
Unfinished business.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.140
Why are you wearing my tiara?

17:44.640 --> 17:46.630
I'm working undercover

17:46.680 --> 17:49.190
as the Dowager Duchess of Worcester.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.510
Well, you are a loss
to the aristocracy.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.430
Oh, thank you so much.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.680
Perhaps you'd care to tell
me what I've missed.

18:01.600 --> 18:04.470
"Ladies and gentlemen,
I should like to...

18:04.520 --> 18:07.230
~ "congratulate you..." Oh!
~ Zut alors!

18:07.280 --> 18:10.750
~ Pardonnez-moi!
~ You imbecile!

18:10.800 --> 18:14.550
Votre chemise! Wet! Wet! Wet!

18:14.600 --> 18:16.350
G'oh! Get on with your work!

18:16.400 --> 18:20.900
I've got to go and get changed for
my welcoming speech, haven't I?!

18:46.200 --> 18:48.270
I finished the article.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.430
~ You shouldn't be in here.
~ I wanted you to read it.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.670
Yes, well, I have a speech to make.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.110
I'd read it now... if I were you.

18:57.160 --> 18:59.160
I've made you a copy.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.990
A list of priceless artwork.

19:13.720 --> 19:19.070
Matisse, Klimt, Egon Schiele...

19:19.120 --> 19:21.720
Perhaps you're familiar with them.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.910
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

19:29.960 --> 19:34.390
Paintings stolen by the Nazis
from Jewish families.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.470
Abramsky.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.910
Braunstein.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.600
Himelbaum.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.950
Perhaps you remember me now.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.550
Well, I wish someone had warned me.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.400
We don't even know
if Flambeau's here.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.750
I might have known.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.150
A bomb.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.870
It's a bomb... it's a bomb!

20:18.920 --> 20:20.670
Sergeant!

20:22.320 --> 20:24.950
There's no need to panic!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.870
Speak for yourself!

20:28.560 --> 20:30.760
Quick as you can, come on!

20:38.320 --> 20:40.550
They need some help. A bomb!

20:40.600 --> 20:42.390
Boom! Boom!

20:42.440 --> 20:44.200
Allez! Allez!

21:13.680 --> 21:15.710
Misdirection.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.710
A classic diversionary tactic.

21:18.760 --> 21:20.470
I'd love to stop and chat,

21:20.520 --> 21:23.390
but there's a painting
I need to steal.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.670
And if I tried to stop you?

21:25.720 --> 21:27.230
That wouldn't be advisable.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.080
Not while I've got
a knife in my hand.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.070
Hmm.

21:32.120 --> 21:34.920
A painting on the
theme of redemption.

21:35.720 --> 21:37.670
A irresistible prize.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.230
A welcome addition to
my private collection.

21:41.280 --> 21:44.440
And will you be strolling out
of here in broad daylight?

21:46.920 --> 21:48.350
That might be imprudent.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.670
Perhaps I should narrow
the odds in my favour.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.070
Hercule?

22:03.120 --> 22:04.520
Rebecca?

22:14.600 --> 22:15.830
Red...

22:15.880 --> 22:18.270
in, black in.

22:18.320 --> 22:19.760
Red out.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.200
He's got the painting.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.560
Oh, no.

22:32.640 --> 22:34.980
It's going to blow! Get down!

22:37.760 --> 22:39.760
Thank you, Inspector.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.660
One of these days...

22:50.920 --> 22:52.520
The painting!

22:55.440 --> 22:57.520
Oh, no, you don't...

23:01.120 --> 23:03.070
The painting's gone! Seal the exits.

23:03.120 --> 23:05.260
I want everyone searched.

23:07.160 --> 23:08.670
Have you seen Father Brown?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.860
He must be still inside.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.790
That's him! That's our man!

23:24.400 --> 23:26.030
I need to get you out of here.

23:26.080 --> 23:29.020
~ I can't leave the others!
~ It isn't safe.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.430
Well, of all the nerve!

23:32.240 --> 23:34.640
Get your greasy hands off me!

24:25.840 --> 24:27.400
Himelbaum.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.990
I've been looking at your war record.

24:41.040 --> 24:42.510
Distinguished service.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.230
Military Medal.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.580
Unexploded mortar shell.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.400
Blew up in my face when
I was trying to defuse it.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.430
I should be a hero.

24:53.480 --> 24:56.190
But you fell victim
to a life of crime.

24:56.240 --> 24:57.910
Written off.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.830
In favour of men who
barely saw service.

25:00.880 --> 25:04.070
You realise you'll get
ten more years for this?

25:04.120 --> 25:05.920
Bomb wasn't real.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.790
If we don't catch Flambeau,

25:08.840 --> 25:10.780
you'll take the rap.

25:16.520 --> 25:18.670
He paid me a visit in prison.

25:18.720 --> 25:20.720
Hired me for the job.

25:21.240 --> 25:23.590
~ Half the money upfront...
~ And now you're out of pocket.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.950
The rest of the money's
in a safety deposit box.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.110
Cheltenham Station.

25:28.160 --> 25:31.510
I expect he'll try and pick
it up, with me indisposed.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.790
Then we'll make sure
we're waiting for him.

25:33.840 --> 25:34.830
In the meantime,

25:34.880 --> 25:37.150
there's a cell in this station
with your name on it.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.590
I want to talk to my solicitor.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.310
Sergeant, get on to Cheltenham.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.390
All available units to
the railway station.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.870
~ Inspector...
~ I'll meet them there.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.470
Any news on Flambeau's whereabouts?

25:48.520 --> 25:51.120
None that I'll be sharing with you.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.790
It's just I'm concerned
about Mr Cadwaller.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.670
No-one's seen him since the heist.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.720
Maybe he was in on it.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.270
What do you mean by that?

26:02.320 --> 26:04.310
Recently cautioned for
suspected "shilling",

26:04.360 --> 26:05.910
pushing up the value of his paintings

26:05.960 --> 26:07.310
through fake bids at auction.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.910
Yes, the Met investigation
couldn't prove anything,

26:09.960 --> 26:12.070
but your pal Cadwaller's got form.

26:12.120 --> 26:15.620
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've a thief to apprehend.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.390
He'll be halfway to France by now.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.750
While the police waste their
time chasing shadows.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.830
Any news on Binkie?

26:27.880 --> 26:30.590
Ashamed to show his face, no doubt.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.840
His reputation in tatters.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.630
Binkie Cadwaller...

26:35.680 --> 26:37.230
is hiding a grievous secret,

26:37.280 --> 26:40.790
if the claims made in this
article can be verified.

26:40.840 --> 26:44.990
Someone else is intent on destroying
him, someone with a vested interest.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.430
Maybe Her Ladyship knows
where he's got to.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.990
And she left with the
American gentleman.

26:50.040 --> 26:52.240
Some people know no shame.

26:52.960 --> 26:56.030
What did the American
gentleman look like?

26:56.080 --> 27:00.480
Handsome, I suppose... in a raffish
sort of way. Expensive suit...

27:02.720 --> 27:04.720
.. and French cologne.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.390
Stolen from under our very noses.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.580
Typical French audacity.

27:12.480 --> 27:15.220
I didn't even get to set eyes on him.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.950
At least they caught
Flambeau's accomplice.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.150
McConnell was expendable.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.070
Collateral damage.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.590
Something's been troubling me.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.430
Well?

27:28.480 --> 27:29.910
Don't keep me in suspense.

27:29.960 --> 27:32.560
You offered to pick me up at 2.30.

27:33.080 --> 27:36.640
You knew what time the preview started,
even before I invited you.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.230
You're smarter than you look.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.270
You're no oil man.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.790
Your hands are too soft.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.790
I've never been to Texas.

27:44.840 --> 27:48.310
~ The climate doesn't suit me.
~ I had you down for a gentleman.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.990
You're nothing but a common thief.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.150
I needed a ticket.
You wanted attention.

27:52.200 --> 27:54.150
How dare you presume to
know anything about me!

27:54.200 --> 27:55.870
You're trapped in
a loveless marriage,

27:55.920 --> 27:57.830
filling the void with
mundane distractions.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.550
You see each other
briefly at breakfast

27:59.600 --> 28:01.790
and His Lordship only ever
looks right through you.

28:01.840 --> 28:04.110
If you don't leave this instant,
I'll ring for Hornby.

28:04.160 --> 28:05.670
You gave the butler the evening off.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.820
Cheltenham Picture House:
Singin' In The Rain.

28:16.720 --> 28:18.390
Hello, police?

28:19.320 --> 28:21.790
This is Lady Felicia Montague...

28:23.440 --> 28:25.310
The police are busy
searching for a thief.

28:25.360 --> 28:28.360
The last place they'll
look for him is here.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.950
~ Oh, thank goodness!
~ Well, if it isn't the bishop.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.270
I was expecting you earlier.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.060
Tell me you've brought reinforcements.

28:47.440 --> 28:48.750
I'm afraid I came alone.

28:48.800 --> 28:51.740
Not even armed with
your trusty umbrella?

28:51.840 --> 28:53.310
Ah, in all the excitement,

28:53.360 --> 28:55.110
I must have left it in the cloakroom.

28:55.160 --> 28:58.350
Inept and forgetful - you
ARE losing your touch.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.430
Rebecca Himelbaum.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.080
You know her.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.860
I knew her once.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.440
In another life.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.350
A wartime liaison
that ended abruptly.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.590
Bitte! Bitte! Nein, nein, nein!

29:16.640 --> 29:17.750
Vater!

29:17.800 --> 29:19.710
Rebecca! Nein!

29:19.760 --> 29:22.960
~ Bitte, nehmen Sie sie nicht weg!
~ Rebecca, nein!

29:24.480 --> 29:26.320
Sie auch. Jetzt.

29:29.920 --> 29:32.190
No! Lass die Finger von ihr!

29:39.880 --> 29:41.990
Nicht bewegen!

29:42.040 --> 29:43.710
~ Los!
~ Rebecca!

29:45.280 --> 29:46.760
Bewegen!

29:50.240 --> 29:51.550
In den Wagen!

29:51.600 --> 29:53.400
Halt dein Maul!

29:54.400 --> 29:55.720
Los!

30:02.600 --> 30:05.110
They took the Himelbaums
to Theresienstadt,

30:05.160 --> 30:07.110
a camp near the Elbe.

30:07.160 --> 30:09.560
I never saw any of them again.

30:09.800 --> 30:13.030
~ Until today.
~ I was convinced Rebecca had been murdered.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.950
A victim of the Holocaust.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.940
Binkie betrayed her.

30:17.800 --> 30:20.710
Cadwaller knew the Himelbaums
owned priceless works of art.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.630
He struck a deal with the SS.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.430
He sent them to their deaths
in return for a cut of the loot.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.080
You're lying.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.110
It soon became a lucrative habit.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.550
Binkie might be a rogue, but
he wouldn't stoop that low.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.990
As soon as the war ended,
he sold on the art

30:35.040 --> 30:37.190
for an exorbitant profit.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.270
There were plenty of buyers.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.320
The Vatican, for one.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.780
You stole that painting
to settle a grudge.

30:45.480 --> 30:46.950
This time it was personal.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.430
~ Where is it now?
~ That would be telling.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.110
Must be well hidden, otherwise
I would have spotted it.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.670
Rebecca is determined to
exact her own revenge.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.510
Why do women always
complicate things?

30:58.560 --> 31:01.990
The police will arrest her for
murder, unless we find her.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.510
Cadwaller deserves all he gets.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.950
Do you want her to hang?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.630
The past is history.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.670
~ It's of no concern to me.
~ This is your chance to make amends.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.990
This time you CAN save her.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.470
We don't even know
where she's taken him.

31:18.520 --> 31:21.920
Someone will have seen them
leaving the Belvedere.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.270
Two office doors.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.590
They never left the museum.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.910
I've been compiling a
dossier since the war,

31:32.960 --> 31:37.270
enough damning evidence
to lock you up for life.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.310
Circumstantial evidence.

31:39.360 --> 31:41.750
You'll never be able
to prove a thing.

31:41.800 --> 31:44.270
First the Jews were forced
to hide their art.

31:44.320 --> 31:47.260
Then they were forced
to hide themselves.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.760
Now it is the Nazis who are hiding.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.150
The Nazis and their collaborators.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.940
I had no idea what the SS were doing.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.350
You won't be around
to refute the claims.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.030
~ I doubt you'll be missed.
~ You're insane!

32:02.080 --> 32:03.670
You were party to genocide.

32:03.720 --> 32:06.920
~ I've presented the evidence.
~ This is your trial.

32:10.480 --> 32:13.360
Ways to kill a war criminal...

32:15.520 --> 32:18.120
I could leave you here to starve...

32:19.120 --> 32:22.320
.. untie you now and shoot
you while you escape.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.480
They say gas is a quick way to die.

32:29.680 --> 32:32.190
We can't ask the people
you sent to the camps.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.230
Please...

32:34.280 --> 32:38.920
~ this is madness.
~ Dangerously toxic in confined spaces.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.470
Thick steel walls.

32:47.880 --> 32:50.760
No-one will hear you scream.

32:57.320 --> 33:00.390
We've only got an hour before
Lady Felicia calls the police.

33:00.440 --> 33:01.630
You keep him talking...

33:01.680 --> 33:03.620
I'll break his neck.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.870
Ah, I only meant to hit the bonnet.

33:13.920 --> 33:15.510
Misdirection.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.900
I'll make a thief of you yet.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.990
A hoard of buried treasure,
safe from prying eyes.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.110
And thieving hands.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.750
There are worse sins than avarice.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.350
A sin is a sin.

33:36.400 --> 33:37.670
Sin requires guilt,

33:37.720 --> 33:40.310
a cognitive emotion I've
never experienced.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.630
Rebecca? You loved her once.

33:43.640 --> 33:45.230
Love is an indulgence

33:45.280 --> 33:47.150
that leads only to weakness.

33:47.200 --> 33:51.030
A trap, like religion. I'll never
make the same mistake again.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.830
It's a very lonely predicament.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.630
You took a vow of celibacy.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.510
Every night in an empty bed?

33:56.560 --> 33:57.790
I can always talk to God.

33:57.840 --> 34:00.830
Praying for some company? Now,
I'd say that was lonely.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.470
I think we should split up.

34:02.520 --> 34:04.190
I think so too.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.000
Rebecca?

34:27.199 --> 34:29.070
Cadwaller is mine.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.620
I didn't come back for Cadwaller.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.989
What did you turn into...

34:38.040 --> 34:40.550
while I festered in that place?

34:40.600 --> 34:42.230
I thought you were dead.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.380
You're no better than
the man who betrayed us.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.710
I stole the painting to ruin him.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.900
I didn't need your help.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.429
Vengeance is God's alone.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.620
You brought me a priest?

34:58.320 --> 34:59.870
He will face justice.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.720
My mother died of
typhoid in Birkenau.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.350
I held her in my arms...

35:05.400 --> 35:06.910
and she didn't even know me.

35:06.960 --> 35:07.990
This is not the way.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.640
My father was killed in Auschwitz.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.270
Betrayed and condemned,

35:13.320 --> 35:14.750
deprived of his dignity,

35:14.800 --> 35:16.070
the people he loved.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.110
But you survived.

35:17.160 --> 35:21.150
It took me eight long years to
find the proof to damn Cadwaller.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.670
And now I'm supposed to forgive?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.790
If it helps you to find peace, yes.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.270
It's a little too late
for a homily, Father.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.790
If Cadwaller dies, you'll hang.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.350
Bittersweet revenge.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.400
I give you my word...

35:34.960 --> 35:36.750
.. he will face justice,

35:36.800 --> 35:38.870
in return for his life.

35:39.880 --> 35:41.870
I locked him in.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.790
Help me!

35:43.840 --> 35:46.320
Please, God! Somebody!

35:54.840 --> 35:58.040
If you ever really loved
me, you'd let him die.

36:08.120 --> 36:10.190
If that man dies, she
will be a murderer.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.230
~ I'll see she gets away.
~ To live like you?

36:12.280 --> 36:13.830
A fugitive?

36:13.880 --> 36:16.150
You owe her more than that.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.920
Open it.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.790
He unlocked the vault
with a gun to his head.

36:23.840 --> 36:25.470
I don't even know the combination.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.520
For once in your life, use
your dubious skills for good.

36:33.600 --> 36:36.470
Drive camshaft.
Three-digit encryption.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.640
14.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.670
We're running out of time.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.950
To crack a lock like
this could take hours.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.520
I need tools. Silence.

37:00.600 --> 37:01.800
14?

37:05.320 --> 37:06.950
The year in the painting.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.710
1452.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.070
14-5-2?

37:11.120 --> 37:12.520
Try that?

37:42.160 --> 37:45.100
An early death would
be too good for you.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.110
The police will be arriving soon.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.270
I wouldn't want them
to find you here.

37:50.320 --> 37:53.270
Say a prayer for the
Himelbaums, Father.

37:53.320 --> 37:55.860
After all, we share the same god.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.000
Go after her.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.590
I went to the camp after liberation.

38:06.640 --> 38:08.590
No names.

38:08.640 --> 38:09.950
Only numbers.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.520
So you consigned me to history?

38:15.480 --> 38:17.710
~ It was easier.
~ Easier?

38:17.760 --> 38:18.750
For whom?

38:18.800 --> 38:21.750
I tortured myself for not
being able to save you.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.740
It was only a memory
that kept me alive.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.640
The memory of someone I loved.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.630
So you see, you did save me.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.790
Perhaps I could search
for the man I once was.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.710
We've both changed.

38:38.520 --> 38:40.460
We're strangers now.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.430
I would never have
been enough for you.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.510
You sent them to their deaths.

38:58.560 --> 39:01.660
~ It was just business.
~ They were murdered...

39:02.320 --> 39:05.150
~ .. for a painting?
~ If you expose me,

39:05.200 --> 39:07.470
you'll implicate the church.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.990
The guilty will answer
for what they have done.

39:12.040 --> 39:15.240
And you will pay with a proper trial.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.920
The first time I held it...

39:19.920 --> 39:22.260
.. I was looking into heaven.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.950
I saw the wicked...

39:25.600 --> 39:27.830
.. condemned to doom.

39:27.880 --> 39:29.560
To damnation.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.470
I saw my own fate.

39:35.520 --> 39:37.660
God is a merciful judge.

39:38.120 --> 39:42.840
There is always redemption
for those who truly seek it.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.590
I still want you to
return that painting.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.470
I thought I'd hang it
in my dressing room.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.910
And what will it remind you of?

39:59.960 --> 40:01.990
This is hardly the time for a sermon.

40:02.040 --> 40:04.630
You've exiled yourself
to a life of purgatory.

40:04.680 --> 40:07.150
Surrounded by beautiful things.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.710
Because your soul is dark.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.430
You grew up without your father.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.680
You couldn't help Rebecca.

40:14.560 --> 40:17.300
Is it because you couldn't save them?

40:18.280 --> 40:23.590
You are a bereaved human being
who now chooses to feel nothing.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.830
The choices are mine to make.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.880
There's no going back.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.870
My valet will be waiting.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.390
Then you mustn't let me keep you.

40:33.440 --> 40:36.110
The forecast is for evening showers.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.460
Why don't you take this?

40:43.280 --> 40:45.590
At least let me protect
you from the rain.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.550
A reckless offer to make to a thief.

40:47.600 --> 40:51.500
Well, I know that I will get
it back when I see you again.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.740
A bientot, Father Brown.

41:10.240 --> 41:13.640
~ Where's Flambeau?
~ I'm afraid... he gave me the slip.

41:26.080 --> 41:28.110
He played me for a fool.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.280
Beguiled and deceived
by easy flattery.

41:33.440 --> 41:36.070
Yes, well, Flambeau can
be quite the charmer.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.830
You let him off the hook. Again.

41:37.880 --> 41:40.110
You're beginning to sound
like Inspector Sullivan.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.950
On top of everything else, I've just
had the bishop on the telephone,

41:44.000 --> 41:46.710
"anguished" and "outraged"
at the loss of the painting.

41:46.760 --> 41:49.550
Wait till he reads about
Binkie's wartime exploits.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.880
~ Oh...!
~ There'll be quite a few
sweaty palms in St Peter's.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.110
I made a promise to Rebecca,

41:59.160 --> 42:02.030
and we're all going to have
to live with the consequences.

42:02.080 --> 42:05.180
While Flambeau gets away
with the stolen loot.

42:10.680 --> 42:14.070
~ Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
~ How on earth did you find it?

42:14.120 --> 42:17.620
He didn't have the painting
when he left the museum.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.740
Events conspired against him.

42:21.720 --> 42:25.230
'He realised that I could help
him get it out of the Belvedere,

42:25.280 --> 42:27.280
'hidden in my brolly.

42:28.680 --> 42:31.630
'Some clever improvisation
to evade the police.'

42:31.680 --> 42:33.950
That's him! That's our man!

42:34.520 --> 42:36.310
I need to get you out of here.

42:36.360 --> 42:39.310
~ I can't leave the others!
~ It isn't safe.

42:39.360 --> 42:42.300
He knew I'd work out
where he was hiding.

42:42.840 --> 42:44.710
An unwitting accomplice.

42:44.760 --> 42:47.100
Unfortunately for Flambeau...

42:48.360 --> 42:50.560
.. I can be absent-minded.

42:58.640 --> 43:00.470
"For what shall it profit a man

43:00.520 --> 43:02.350
"if he gain the whole world

43:02.400 --> 43:05.000
"and suffer the loss of his soul."

43:05.600 --> 43:07.440
Argh!

43:22.040 --> 43:23.430
So wait,

43:23.480 --> 43:25.990
he didn't go back to save Rebecca?

43:26.040 --> 43:27.630
Who knows?

43:27.680 --> 43:29.310
But for Flambeau,

43:29.360 --> 43:31.360
redemption is still...

43:32.640 --> 43:34.160
.. a long way off.
