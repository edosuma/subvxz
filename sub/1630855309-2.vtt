WEBVTT

00:11.791 --> 00:14.000
Look out! Oh! Ah!

00:14.000 --> 00:18.125
Stand your ground, wuss.
Stop getting cucked by the wind.

00:18.125 --> 00:21.458
Better to be a living cuck
than a dead hero.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.666
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:23.666 --> 00:25.083
Fuck! Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:25.083 --> 00:28.833
Ah! The fire! The piss!
The fire and the piss!

00:28.833 --> 00:30.958
You gonna plug that thing back in or not?

00:35.291 --> 00:38.666
And then Gavin,
sniveling coward that he is,

00:38.666 --> 00:40.291
started to weep and beg me

00:40.291 --> 00:43.708
to "pwease, pwease, pwease
plug the thing back in."

00:43.708 --> 00:47.916
And I said, "Of course, I will.
I am the bravest of wizards."

00:47.916 --> 00:52.416
And he replied, "Not me.
I just wee-weed my big-boy pants."

00:53.666 --> 00:56.125
Yeah, Gavin died a coward's death.
I called it.

00:56.125 --> 01:00.375
Those were, of course,
the last words Gavin ever spoke.

01:00.375 --> 01:03.666
He then slipped in a puddle
of his own sissy water

01:03.666 --> 01:07.500
and skidded off the roof
to his unflattering demise,

01:07.500 --> 01:11.125
leaving only me to tell his pathetic tale.

01:11.125 --> 01:14.333
God rest his chickenshit soul.

01:15.250 --> 01:18.833
But of course, I sallied on,
plugged in the thingy,

01:18.833 --> 01:20.625
and saved the entire office.

01:20.625 --> 01:23.125
Okay, we don't have all day.

01:23.125 --> 01:26.208
Here's your certificate
for "Employee of the Month."

01:26.208 --> 01:29.625
Show this at the cafeteria
and you get a free yogurt.

01:29.625 --> 01:30.750
- Not Greek.
- Woo!

01:30.750 --> 01:31.958
- All right!
- Oh, bittersweet.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.583
This will be in my office
if you want a closer look.

01:34.583 --> 01:37.583
You're my hero.
Will you sign my butthole, Mr. Hero?

01:37.583 --> 01:39.916
Ahh, with pleasure, young fellow.

01:39.916 --> 01:42.125
I love how every time you tell the story

01:42.125 --> 01:45.000
there are new details
that make you <i>more</i> fuckable.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.083
Yeah.
That is something, isn't it?

01:47.083 --> 01:48.583
- Who said that?
- I did.

01:48.583 --> 01:49.958
Gavin?

01:49.958 --> 01:51.875
You're... alive.

01:51.875 --> 01:56.833
Actually, I'm Guyvin. Gavin's identical
but suspiciously nice twin brother.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.125
- Oh!
- Oh, of course.

01:58.125 --> 01:59.541
Gavin had a twin brother.

01:59.541 --> 02:01.666
- Okay. That makes sense.
- No, it doesn't.

02:01.666 --> 02:05.083
Sometimes characters have twins
and that's just good storytelling.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.916
- That checks out.
- Right, my identical-twin sister, Bonnie?

02:07.916 --> 02:12.166
Yeah, Connie, but we're not identical
because I have a different haircut.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.791
- And glasses. Bye, Bonnie<i>.
-</i> Bye, Connie.

02:14.791 --> 02:17.708
- Hey, Wizard.
- Oh, no! Please don't hurt me, Gavin.

02:17.708 --> 02:20.500
Well, first of all, buddy,
my name is Guyvin.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.250
And second, I don't wanna hurt you,
I wanna thank you

02:23.250 --> 02:25.458
and give you a gentle hug.

02:25.458 --> 02:26.750
Thank me? For what?

02:26.750 --> 02:29.416
For being with my brother
in the last moments of his life.

02:29.416 --> 02:32.166
As his identical twin,
I could feel all of his pain.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.958
- Oh...
- But I don't know none of the details.

02:33.958 --> 02:35.583
Because they keep changing.

02:35.583 --> 02:37.208
That's why I wanna take you to coffee.

02:37.208 --> 02:41.000
So you can walk me through
his last moments, gimme a little closure.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.125
-"Closure"?
- Yeah.

02:42.125 --> 02:46.250
No distractions. Just you and me,
and some nighttime coffee.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.125
Yeah, well, the caffeine
may ruin my slumber,

02:49.125 --> 02:52.125
but how could I say no to you, uh, Guyvin?

02:52.125 --> 02:56.291
Oh, and his name is Guyvin because
it sounds like Gavin, but he's a guy.

02:56.291 --> 02:58.125
You know, that must be why
my brother's name

02:58.125 --> 03:00.083
is "Joe But With A Regular Penis."

03:00.083 --> 03:02.625
Oh, yeah, and how is
Joe But With A Regular Penis?

03:02.625 --> 03:04.541
You know, he's very sick, actually.

03:42.666 --> 03:43.916
Office chicken.

03:43.916 --> 03:48.458
So, um, Emmy, uh, as someone
who I am slowly growing to respect--

03:48.458 --> 03:51.041
What? Pete respects <i>moi-ha-ha?</i>

03:51.041 --> 03:55.875
I was just wondering if I could ask you
for some, uh, professional love advice?

03:55.875 --> 03:59.083
Oh, and now he needs Daddy's help.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.166
- Immediately regret this.
- No, no, no, no, no!

04:01.166 --> 04:03.250
Don't go. Uh, let me guess.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.708
Now that Dante and Rochelle are done-zo,

04:05.708 --> 04:10.500
you wanna know how long you should wait
before you make your big move.

04:10.500 --> 04:11.666
Actually, yes.

04:11.666 --> 04:14.166
I, uh, stayed up all night
coding parametric models

04:14.166 --> 04:16.583
- to pinpoint the optimal time to tell her.
- Okaaay...

04:16.583 --> 04:20.625
Each timeframe uses what I'm calling
"confession points" or "CPs."

04:20.625 --> 04:21.875
- Um...?
- As you can see here,

04:21.875 --> 04:24.416
if I go with a three-month CP,
I'm being respectful,

04:24.416 --> 04:26.500
but risk her moving on
and finding happiness.

04:27.083 --> 04:32.083
Hey, if you wanna "C" some "P,"
you gotta ask her out today, <i>hombre.</i>

04:32.083 --> 04:35.000
What? [stammers] No.
The trend line on a 24-hour CP is--

04:35.000 --> 04:39.375
Okay, listen, Old Sheldon,
this <i>Big Bang</i> energy ain't helping you.

04:39.375 --> 04:42.125
I have this friend.
I'm not gonna name any names--

04:42.125 --> 04:45.541
Is it Van? That Logic Rock
you won't stop talking about?

04:45.541 --> 04:49.166
It is. And Van just went for it with me.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.541
She smooched my brains out
at the Jizz Mitzvah,

04:51.541 --> 04:54.291
and now I'll do <i>anything</i> she wants.

04:54.291 --> 04:56.541
She basically owns my ass.

04:56.541 --> 04:59.625
So, do you wanna
own Rochelle's ass or not?

04:59.625 --> 05:01.500
Well, ideally, I would enter into

05:01.500 --> 05:04.208
some sort of cooperative agreement
with Rochelle's ass,

05:04.208 --> 05:05.833
where I assume a minority stake and--

05:05.833 --> 05:10.000
Oh, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete,
that's for the butt lawyers to work out.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.791
Daddy's gonna go talk you up to Rochelle...

05:12.791 --> 05:13.875
- What?
- ...right now.

05:13.875 --> 05:17.083
No! No, I'm not ready.
Please, Daddy, don't!

05:17.083 --> 05:20.875
Look at Dante eat-pray-fucking his way
through the southern hemisphere.

05:20.875 --> 05:24.708
It's like men get freakin' flyer miles
for every chick they screw over.

05:24.708 --> 05:29.416
Meanwhile, all Rochelle got
was a broken heart and Emmy's chlamydia.

05:29.416 --> 05:31.250
Guys, come on. I'm trying to work.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.458
I don't wanna see
Dante sucking off a llama.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.583
Oh! <i>That's</i> what he's doing.

05:35.583 --> 05:37.291
- You want my advice, Rochelle?
- Not really.

05:37.291 --> 05:40.833
- He's a loser. He left. Get over it.
- Petra's right.

05:40.833 --> 05:45.458
There are plenty of other fish
right here in the office,

05:45.458 --> 05:48.125
just waiting to get
absolutely filleted by you.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.583
Everyone stop, okay?
I'm not trying to filet any fish.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.916
I just wanna focus
on my clients right now.

05:53.916 --> 05:57.375
But if you, the world's greatest Lovebug,
can't find love,

05:57.375 --> 05:59.166
what chance do your clients have?

05:59.166 --> 06:00.958
- No chance.
- Exactly.

06:00.958 --> 06:04.333
Oh, my God, they have no fucking chance.

06:04.333 --> 06:07.541
- Whoa, Rochelle, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

06:07.541 --> 06:10.250
Tito's right.
Love is my whole fucking thing.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.875
If I suck ass at it,
what good am I to anyone? Hmm?

06:12.875 --> 06:14.416
Mm, mm, mm...

06:14.416 --> 06:18.458
- Bitch, what you need is a little Hope.
- Oh!

06:18.458 --> 06:21.666
Oh, my God, Hope!
Girl, where have you been?

06:21.666 --> 06:23.500
Honey, where <i>haven't</i> I been?

06:23.500 --> 06:26.208
There ain't a person
on that rapidly warming planet

06:26.208 --> 06:28.333
that don't wanna get to know my fine ass.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.041
But when I heard
my number one was hurting,

06:31.041 --> 06:33.916
chile, you best believe I said,
"Let 'em all die."

06:33.916 --> 06:38.125
So, wait, your job is hope
and your name is Hope?

06:38.125 --> 06:43.250
Yeah, it's my whole gestalt, baby.
I bring possibility and wonder.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.291
And a big sparkling bag of bullshit.

06:45.291 --> 06:47.541
- Hello to you, too, Petra.
- Ugh.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.833
- Please don't start, ladies.
- You know somethin'?

06:49.833 --> 06:52.458
My clients don't <i>hope</i> they get a new job,

06:52.458 --> 06:55.291
they work their asses off
and <i>earn</i> a new job.

06:55.291 --> 06:58.666
Girl, shut up. You know it's hope
that makes people hustle.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.250
Yeah, shut up, Petra.

07:00.250 --> 07:01.666
What'd you fuckin' say to me?

07:01.666 --> 07:03.000
I said I respect you so much.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.333
All right, Rochelle,
here's how we're gonna turn

07:05.333 --> 07:07.583
your mopin' into some hopin'.

07:07.583 --> 07:10.000
- First, we're taking the day off.
- Oh.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.875
I wish I could,
but I've got this client, Alice.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.250
She's got a first date tonight.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.500
Ooh! Even better. I love a first date.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.916
All the feels and suspense.
Will they be the one?

07:20.916 --> 07:23.375
Or just the one they fuck tonight?

07:23.375 --> 07:26.125
- First date intercourse!
- First date intercourse!

07:26.125 --> 07:28.166
I love it when Hope
comes to town.

07:28.166 --> 07:29.333
I'm coming too.

07:29.333 --> 07:32.583
You can't have a first date without the
constant fear of it going horribly wrong.

07:32.583 --> 07:33.625
Girls' night!

07:33.625 --> 07:36.833
I don't know, Hope. I don't wanna put
too much pressure on this date.

07:36.833 --> 07:41.291
Oh, loosen up, Rochelle.
Hope is here. Anything is possible.

07:42.208 --> 07:45.958
Okay, fine. But can we turn down
the disco booby balls?

07:47.208 --> 07:48.666
They don't have an off switch.

07:48.666 --> 07:50.166
What a fuckin' phony.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.083
Damn, Petra, you really hate Hope.

07:52.083 --> 07:55.041
I don't hate her.
I just think she's a total flake.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.916
And honestly?
I don't think her tits are real.

07:56.916 --> 07:58.875
Well, yeah. They're disco balls.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.875
<i>♪ Pee-pee time ♪</i>

08:09.875 --> 08:12.166
<i>♪ Time to go pee-pee
'Cause it's pee-pee time ♪</i>

08:16.083 --> 08:17.708
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

08:17.708 --> 08:20.125
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

08:20.125 --> 08:21.125
Every time.

08:21.125 --> 08:23.166
Wow. Every time.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.791
Fire-hose dick.

08:24.791 --> 08:27.416
- Pete! Hide with me.
- Oh!

08:27.416 --> 08:28.500
Uh, what? Why?

08:28.500 --> 08:31.708
- I don't want Guyvin to see us.
- Why? What's wrong?

08:31.708 --> 08:34.000
You must promise
not to call me cuckoo bananas.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.750
That's a promise
I feel comfortable making.

08:35.750 --> 08:38.416
I believe, beyond a shadow of a doubt,

08:38.416 --> 08:41.166
that Guyvin is actually Gavin.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.750
- No, yeah, you're cuckoo bananas.
- No! No, I'm not!

08:43.750 --> 08:46.500
I snuck in the bathroom
and looked at his penis.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.250
This isn't helping your case.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.333
It's identical to Gavin's.

08:50.333 --> 08:51.750
Well, they're twins.

08:51.750 --> 08:55.083
Look, it sounds like Gavin's death
was very traumatic for you,

08:55.083 --> 08:58.166
and there must be some part of you
that wishes he was still alive.

08:58.166 --> 08:59.916
No, no, no, no, that's not it.

08:59.916 --> 09:02.583
You probably have survivor's guilt
because you couldn't save him.

09:02.583 --> 09:06.541
Oh, survivor's guilt. Like you with Dante?

09:06.541 --> 09:08.666
Well, no. I <i>saved</i> Dante.

09:08.666 --> 09:11.250
By divorcing him from his favorite cock.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.458
To save his life.

09:12.458 --> 09:14.083
Sure, by ruining it.

09:14.083 --> 09:16.416
So if I'm scared of Guyvin,

09:16.416 --> 09:20.916
you must be terrified that Dante
will make good on his vow of revenge.

09:20.916 --> 09:23.375
Wait. Do you really think
Dante is gonna get revenge on me?

09:23.375 --> 09:24.666
- I do.
- Oh, God.

09:24.666 --> 09:28.375
And I'm quite sure
Gavin's back from the dead to kill me.

09:28.375 --> 09:30.750
I'll see you in hell, Peter.

09:30.750 --> 09:34.916
So, Alice, tonight's the big date.

09:34.916 --> 09:37.583
Tell me everything. Spill the tea.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.541
How did you and this dreamboat Shawn meet?

09:39.541 --> 09:43.208
- Well, he came to one of my talks.
- Alice is a disability rights activist.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.250
- And then he followed me on Twitter.
- She has a lot of fans.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.166
But this one direct messaged me.

09:48.166 --> 09:49.416
- Ha! That's right!
- Yeah!

09:49.416 --> 09:51.625
- Do you wanna see him?
- Oh my lord.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.625
Look at him in these coochie cutters.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.375
This man is a hunk of cheese.

09:55.375 --> 09:57.666
He is Monterey Jacked.

09:57.666 --> 10:00.500
You cheddar go home with him tonight.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.333
- Hey, can you please not do that?
- Do what?

10:04.333 --> 10:08.958
- Get Alice's hopes up about this guy.
- Girl, put some respect on my name.

10:08.958 --> 10:12.083
I'm just saying, men are trash
no matter how few dicks they have.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.000
Oh, man, Rochelle's not wrong.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.375
Yeah, Alice and I like to have
low expectations when it comes to romance.

10:18.375 --> 10:21.333
"Low expectations"? Why?

10:21.333 --> 10:24.083
Because what if this date
is a total shitshow?

10:24.083 --> 10:27.208
- Thank you. That's what I'm saying.
- I hear you, TeeTee.

10:27.208 --> 10:30.458
But I think the real question is,
what if it isn't?

10:30.458 --> 10:34.000
Oh, my God. I never even considered that.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.583
In fact, I could see this date
going fabulously.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.125
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

10:39.125 --> 10:40.500
Well, baby, I do.

10:40.500 --> 10:44.041
And you best believe

12:31.083 --> 12:32.791
- Shall we?
- Mmm!

12:32.791 --> 12:35.208
I wish he was wearing the shorts
from the picture,

12:35.208 --> 12:36.541
but he's still cute as a button.

12:36.541 --> 12:40.833
Well, hello. Sounds like someone's
feeling a little hopeful.

12:40.833 --> 12:43.666
Yeah, well. Don't let it go
to your big ol' sparkly titties.

12:45.708 --> 12:47.625
God, I love working late.

12:47.625 --> 12:51.333
No Emmy, no Lionel,
just me and my productivity.

12:52.666 --> 12:55.250
Hello? Is somebody here?

12:55.250 --> 12:57.041
Dante?

12:57.041 --> 12:59.333
Is that you?

12:59.916 --> 13:01.333
Uh...

13:01.333 --> 13:03.708
No, that's crazy. Dante's in Peru, right?

13:06.750 --> 13:09.916
Where is that throbbing noise coming from?

13:19.708 --> 13:21.166
Oh, my God!

13:21.166 --> 13:24.458
Why did they carpet over
this gorgeous wood?

13:25.333 --> 13:27.958
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

13:27.958 --> 13:30.750
No! No! No!

13:30.750 --> 13:32.208
I did what I had to do.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.958
I severed what I had to sever.

13:43.666 --> 13:45.791
Thank God. It was just a nightmare.

13:49.458 --> 13:53.583
A used triple-dick condom
with one sleeve torn off?

13:53.583 --> 13:56.208
The dream was real!

13:56.958 --> 13:59.583
Oh, uh... [chuckles] ...by the way,
I really like your sneakers.

13:59.583 --> 14:01.458
- Oh, thank you.
- Where'd you pick 'em up?

14:01.458 --> 14:04.041
Zappos. I don't leave my house
for anything.

14:04.041 --> 14:06.708
Well, you left for me, apparently.
I'm flattered.

14:06.708 --> 14:10.250
Ooh, look at them vibin'.
That's all you, Ro-Ro.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.625
You were right, Hope.
I needed a girls' night out.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.125
Me too. I feel like
I'm on <i>Sex and the City.</i>

14:15.125 --> 14:17.791
Or is it <i>Sex</i> in <i>the City?</i>
I can never remember.

14:17.791 --> 14:20.375
You know, I had sex <i>with</i> a city once.

14:20.375 --> 14:24.666
Pittsburgh gets a bad rap,
but, girl, it knows how to fuck.

14:24.666 --> 14:26.291
Ugh, goddamn it.

14:26.291 --> 14:28.791
I'm so sorry. I even called ahead
to make sure they had a ramp.

14:28.791 --> 14:32.541
Oh, no! We're getting cockblocked
by ADA non-compliance.

14:32.541 --> 14:35.125
All cock should be wheelchair accessible.

14:35.125 --> 14:39.250
- Goddamn it. Something always goes wrong.
- Can we just go home?

14:39.250 --> 14:40.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, ladies.

14:40.833 --> 14:44.000
Y'all are spiraling more than a staircase.
Look over there.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.333
There's a lovely restaurant
across the street

14:46.333 --> 14:48.208
with a super-cute cement ramp.

14:48.208 --> 14:50.375
- Ooh!
- That does look romantic.

14:51.166 --> 14:52.500
Yeah, that place looks awesome.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.541
Oh, but there's no TVs in there.

14:54.541 --> 14:56.416
Girl, you can play with my iPad, okay?

14:56.416 --> 14:58.875
Does your iPad
have sports and pornos on it?

14:58.875 --> 15:01.541
- Yeah, it's an iPad.
- All right.

15:02.625 --> 15:07.000
<i>I'm Guyvin, Gavin's identical
but suspiciously nice twin brother.</i>

15:07.000 --> 15:07.958
Oh, God.

15:07.958 --> 15:11.041
<i>I wanna take you to coffee...
Gimme a little... closure.</i>

15:11.041 --> 15:12.625
He's gonna kill me.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.333
- Knock, knock.
- Gavin!

15:16.333 --> 15:17.791
It's Guyvin, sweetie.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.958
Gavin's my beloved dead brother, remember?

15:19.958 --> 15:24.041
Of course, yes, yes.
Is it, uh... is it coffee time already?

15:24.041 --> 15:28.166
Actually, I thought we could go
up to the roof where he died,

15:28.166 --> 15:31.958
and you could show me
exactly how it happened.

15:31.958 --> 15:34.708
- Up on the roof?
- Just you and me.

15:34.708 --> 15:36.458
Yes, no witnesses.

15:36.458 --> 15:39.583
Well, I don't know what you mean by that,
but, yeah, I guess not.

15:39.583 --> 15:42.208
Oh, God, he really is gonna kill me.

15:42.208 --> 15:46.208
I thought if you could walk me through it,
since you seem to love telling the story,

15:46.208 --> 15:49.083
it might help me
put this whole dead-brother thing to bed.

15:49.083 --> 15:51.541
Oh, yes. Well, that sounds cathartic.

15:51.541 --> 15:53.708
Let me just grab a pashmina.

15:53.708 --> 15:55.416
It gets chilly up there.

15:55.416 --> 15:57.958
Uh, where-- Weapon, weapon,
I gotta find a weapon.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.958
My Nazi dildos.

16:00.958 --> 16:03.333
Yes, the Blitzkrieg,

16:03.333 --> 16:07.958
the largest and heaviest
of my perfectly normal collection.

16:07.958 --> 16:09.083
Oops.

16:09.083 --> 16:11.833
I almost forgot my pashmina.

16:11.833 --> 16:14.166
It really does get chilly up there.

16:17.083 --> 16:21.083
Oh, there's my book...
where I hide my drugs.

16:22.708 --> 16:23.791
Books are so stupid.

16:23.791 --> 16:25.166
- Emmy, hide with me.
- Ho!

16:25.166 --> 16:26.750
- Dude, what's your problem?
- Uh--

16:26.750 --> 16:28.875
I-I'm pretty sure
Dante is trying to kill me.

16:28.875 --> 16:31.083
No way. That's impossible.

16:31.083 --> 16:34.375
Dante's in South America
on some kinda sex safari.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.541
Well then, how do you explain this?

16:36.541 --> 16:39.541
- Okay, brag.
- No, don't you see?

16:39.541 --> 16:43.625
That's a Triton-brand triple-dick condom
with the third shaft torn off.

16:43.625 --> 16:45.208
And I found it in my throat.

16:45.208 --> 16:48.541
- Been there, choked on that, brother.
- Emmy, I'm serious.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.333
Okay, dude, just chill. Jeez.

16:51.333 --> 16:53.500
Dante really is out of town.

16:53.500 --> 16:57.541
Oh! And I think he just got engaged
to this gorgeous llama.

16:57.541 --> 17:00.541
But how do you explain the condom?
I woke up with it in my mouth.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.833
Well, I-I read a science article once

17:02.833 --> 17:06.666
that said we unknowingly swallow
four to five full condoms

17:06.666 --> 17:08.000
in our sleep every year.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.583
Uh, that seems inaccurate.

17:09.583 --> 17:13.416
So what, you think Dante
came all the way back from Peru,

17:13.416 --> 17:17.333
interrupting his llama-lingus,
just to shove a condom in your throat?

17:17.333 --> 17:18.500
Come on, man.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.416
Huh...

17:19.416 --> 17:23.333
I guess when you say it like that,
it does sound a little far-fetched.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.375
Exactly. <i>I'm</i> the voice of reason.

17:26.375 --> 17:29.541
Now, if you're not gonna use that condom,
I will, so hand her over.

17:29.541 --> 17:31.208
Emmy, you can't reuse a condom.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.541
Well, I read a science article once
that actually said you...

17:33.541 --> 17:36.375
Kids, I am morally obligated to tell you

17:36.375 --> 17:38.583
you can never reuse a condom,

17:38.583 --> 17:43.708
unless of course those condoms
are Dr. Maury's Reusable Dong Sleeves.

17:43.708 --> 17:47.916
The hog hats so nice,
you can junk in them twice.

17:47.916 --> 17:50.250
- What? No way.
- I'm serious.

17:50.250 --> 17:53.125
That's the one thing
you wish people would get from your work?

17:53.125 --> 17:55.791
Yeah. Everybody needs
to chill the fuck out.

17:55.791 --> 17:56.958
Okay. Damn.

17:56.958 --> 18:01.875
Disabled people do not need your pity,
especially me. I'm fucking perfect.

18:01.875 --> 18:05.375
You are. I knew it as soon as
you ordered fries for the table.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.458
Ooh! This guy is perfect for you.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.041
He likes your sneakers, he likes fries--

18:11.041 --> 18:14.541
If he likes giving oral,
I am marrying him.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.375
Girl, you should marry him.

18:16.375 --> 18:18.916
Oral is the bedrock of a good marriage.

18:18.916 --> 18:21.958
Damn, I kinda love
seeing Alice so excited about a man.

18:21.958 --> 18:24.708
See? I told you all she needed
was a little Hope.

18:24.708 --> 18:27.625
And I've barely thought about
how Dante tricked me into loving him,

18:27.625 --> 18:28.958
that no-good motherfucker.

18:28.958 --> 18:32.166
Girl, don't you go there.
We all get tricked sometimes.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.708
I once fell for
this brilliant young blonde.

18:34.708 --> 18:37.625
She said she was gonna heal the world
with one drop of blood.

18:37.625 --> 18:41.958
This bitch ended up defrauding
a small country's worth of investors.

18:41.958 --> 18:44.416
- You talking about that Theranos girl?
- The point is,

18:44.416 --> 18:47.958
you never know what's gonna happen
until it happens.

18:47.958 --> 18:51.083
And never trust anyone
who only wears turtlenecks.

18:51.083 --> 18:53.958
Hi. We're so sorry to bother you.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.166
- So don't?
- Yeah, please scram.

18:56.166 --> 18:59.958
But we just wanted to say
what an inspiration you are.

18:59.958 --> 19:01.416
Oh, you know my work?

19:01.416 --> 19:05.083
Oh, no. No, um...
I'm glad that you work, though.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.833
So brave. So inspiring.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.833
They are who I'm talking about.

19:08.833 --> 19:11.458
It's just so great
to see you out and about.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.166
Is this your helper? Your brother?

19:13.166 --> 19:15.125
They need to chill the fuck out.

19:15.125 --> 19:18.041
No, they don't need to chill out,
they need to fuck off.

19:18.041 --> 19:20.958
Excuse me, you guys
are being ableist assholes right now.

19:20.958 --> 19:22.125
You tell 'em, Shawn.

19:22.125 --> 19:25.833
And for your information, she's
a celebrated disability rights activist.

19:25.833 --> 19:28.083
And I'm not her helper, I'm her colleague.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.416
- What'd you say?
- Colleague?

19:29.416 --> 19:31.833
Did he just say they were colleagues?

19:31.833 --> 19:33.166
What the fuck, Rochelle?

19:33.166 --> 19:36.416
- What the fuck, Hope?
- Oh, shit. That's not good.

19:36.416 --> 19:41.000
Just so you know, I'm actually an ally.
My mother lost a finger fishing.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.458
Oh, God. Don't bow.

19:43.166 --> 19:46.708
So you're telling me
my brother, the bravest monster I know,

19:46.708 --> 19:50.083
urinated himself in fear,
accidentally slipped in it,

19:50.083 --> 19:51.666
and then fell off the building?

19:51.666 --> 19:54.208
Yes, yes, that's right.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.250
Gosh, that sounds like
something I would do.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.750
I've always been
the scaredy-cat in the family.

19:58.750 --> 20:00.291
Oh, come off it, Gavin.

20:00.291 --> 20:02.416
I told you, buddy. I'm Guyvin.

20:02.416 --> 20:06.625
Enough of the mindfucking.
Admit it, you bastard.

20:06.625 --> 20:07.750
Whoa! What are you doing?

20:07.750 --> 20:09.458
I know it's you, Gavin,

20:09.458 --> 20:13.250
back to get your revenge on me
for lying about your heroic death

20:13.250 --> 20:16.083
and claiming the glory for myself.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.875
- Is that true?
- We both know it is.

20:18.875 --> 20:22.625
I'm a chicken-shit coward liar.

20:22.625 --> 20:23.958
Oh, Lionel.

20:23.958 --> 20:26.625
I can see this has been
tearing you up inside.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.625
Yes, yes, like the Blitzkrieg. Wait, what?

20:29.625 --> 20:33.541
Oh, I feel terrible for you.
That's a lot to keep to yourself.

20:33.541 --> 20:35.583
So you're not upset?

20:35.583 --> 20:38.000
No, no. If anything, I'm relieved.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.666
This is the closure I needed,
and it sounds like maybe you did too.

20:41.666 --> 20:43.958
Yes, yes, perhaps I did.

20:43.958 --> 20:46.583
Wow, you actually are Guyvin,

20:46.583 --> 20:50.500
Gavin's identical
but suspiciously nice twin brother.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.083
Aw, bring it in, my fellow scaredy-cat.

20:53.083 --> 20:55.000
With pleasure, Guyvin.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.875
- Oh, my pashmina!
- I can't see!

20:56.875 --> 20:58.333
I'm afraid of the dark!

20:58.333 --> 21:01.208
- Oh, and now I'm panic-pissing.
- Oh, dear.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.916
The pashmina! The piss!
The pashmina and the piss!

21:03.916 --> 21:05.583
I know you can't see, Guyvin,

21:05.583 --> 21:09.125
but you're really getting
quite close to the edge. Oh!

21:09.125 --> 21:11.458
And he's gone.

21:13.458 --> 21:17.791
Well, that takes care
of that family, I hope.

21:19.041 --> 21:20.583
Guys, what the fuck?

21:20.583 --> 21:24.125
- He called her his fucking colleague.
- I thought this was a date.

21:24.125 --> 21:27.041
What do we do? Freak out?
I think we should freak out.

21:27.041 --> 21:28.666
Freak out on three? One, two--

21:28.666 --> 21:30.375
No, I'm just gonna ask him.

21:30.375 --> 21:34.125
So, Shawn, why exactly
did you ask me out to dinner?

21:34.125 --> 21:36.875
Oh, yeah. I was kinda hoping
I could pick your brain.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.791
- Ouch.
-"Pick your brain"?

21:38.791 --> 21:42.416
I would not have put on my bra
just to let him pick my brain.

21:42.416 --> 21:47.208
You're supposed to be picking her pussy,
you pickle-pulling non-pussy picker.

21:47.208 --> 21:50.750
I mean, when I told my girlfriend that
we were having dinner, she freaked out.

21:50.750 --> 21:51.791
She loves you.

21:51.791 --> 21:54.166
And he has a girlfriend?
What are you doing?

21:54.166 --> 21:56.000
Girl, he's not into her.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.333
- So you're bailing on us?
- You can't leave now.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.041
The Shawn just hit the fan.

22:00.041 --> 22:03.291
Ladies, I actually have
another client who needs me.

22:03.291 --> 22:06.791
- And if you must know, it is Joe Biden.
- The fuck?

22:06.791 --> 22:10.708
But that's okay, because I promise y'all,
I will be back soon.

22:11.625 --> 22:15.000
Anyway, I thought maybe
you can connect me with your publisher?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.541
- What do I do?
- Drag his ass.

22:17.541 --> 22:19.458
So, Shawn, I'm gonna stop you right there.

22:19.458 --> 22:22.000
Colleagues do not slide
into each other's DMs.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.916
This dinner?
Could have been a fucking email.

22:24.916 --> 22:28.666
And you're not even colleagues.
He has a shitty blog no one reads.

22:28.666 --> 22:31.000
But yes, you can have
my publisher's contact.

22:31.000 --> 22:31.916
Oh, great.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.583
- Wanna write this down?
- Yeah, of course.

22:33.583 --> 22:38.625
She's at SuckMyButt@LickMyBalls.com.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.375
That's right, motherfucker.

22:40.375 --> 22:42.500
- Wait, where are you going?
- I'm going home.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.625
And you're going on the list.

22:44.625 --> 22:45.833
- What list?
- The list.

22:45.833 --> 22:50.625
And it's not like Craigslist.
It's not fuckin' cool to be on this one.

22:51.208 --> 22:53.958
Ladies, I can't believe
I thought this was a date.

22:53.958 --> 22:58.041
No, baby girl, this is not your fault.
I let Hope get my guard down.

22:58.041 --> 23:00.333
Me too. What did I expect?

23:00.333 --> 23:02.625
That's it!

23:02.625 --> 23:04.333
Rochelle. Where you going?

23:04.333 --> 23:07.166
I am gonna whoop Hope's ass.

23:18.041 --> 23:21.500
Dante's dick?

23:25.208 --> 23:26.958
Hey, man, you okay?

23:26.958 --> 23:28.458
- Did you see that?
- See what?

23:28.458 --> 23:30.791
A penis was driving that... penis.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.333
Okay, safe and sound.

23:38.666 --> 23:41.708
"I know what you did last season"?

23:41.708 --> 23:42.791
Is this...

23:42.791 --> 23:44.958
Oh, God, it's jizz!

23:47.958 --> 23:50.375
"I had extra cum."

23:50.375 --> 23:51.958
Oh, gross!

23:51.958 --> 23:53.791
Ooh!

24:23.125 --> 24:24.541
It's dead, Pete.

24:25.041 --> 24:29.458
Dante's penis can't hurt you anymore.

24:30.583 --> 24:33.791
Come on, Kamala. March in there
and wake Sleepy Joe the fuck up.

24:33.791 --> 24:35.791
But, Petra, I don't understand.

24:35.791 --> 24:38.125
Why can't we just use
the printer in my office?

24:38.125 --> 24:39.791
Because Inkjet One

24:39.791 --> 24:42.458
is the most powerful printer
in the free world.

24:42.458 --> 24:44.125
Where the hell is she?

24:44.125 --> 24:46.250
Oh, man, this is gonna be good.

24:46.250 --> 24:48.125
It's okay, Joe.

24:48.125 --> 24:51.125
The Shamrock Shake will be back next year.

24:51.125 --> 24:53.250
How fucking dare you!

24:53.250 --> 24:55.083
Oh, girl, no. Not here.

24:55.083 --> 24:57.916
How could you walk out
in the middle of Alice's date?

24:57.916 --> 24:59.125
You're such a fucking flake.

24:59.125 --> 25:02.125
- I'm not doin' this with you, Rochelle.
- And why the hell not?

25:02.125 --> 25:05.416
Because this,
all this anger and hopelessness,

25:05.416 --> 25:07.083
has nothing to do with me.

25:07.083 --> 25:08.083
Excuse me?!

25:08.083 --> 25:11.208
This is about you
feeling sorry for yourself.

25:11.208 --> 25:13.791
The only person I feel sorry for is Alice.

25:13.791 --> 25:16.416
Getting her goddamn hopes up
like those fake-ass titties of yours.

25:17.333 --> 25:19.500
Okay, first of all, these are real.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.791
Yeah, real fake.

25:20.791 --> 25:23.875
And I'm sorry that guy
turned out to be an asshole.

25:23.875 --> 25:27.250
But Alice doesn't need your pity.
She said so herself.

25:27.250 --> 25:29.708
What she needs is a Lovebug

25:29.708 --> 25:32.750
who doesn't go to pieces
when things don't go her way.

25:32.750 --> 25:34.333
Don't you dare leave again.

25:34.333 --> 25:36.875
I love you, girl. You're my sister.

25:36.875 --> 25:40.958
And I wish I could stay, I really do,
but I simply cannot.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.250
Hey, not cool, man.

25:46.250 --> 25:48.583
Fuck you, Joe Biden.

25:48.583 --> 25:50.958
Aw, you can't lose hope, little lady.

25:50.958 --> 25:56.708
But I can fucking hate that bitch!

25:56.708 --> 25:58.000
Fuck yeah!
