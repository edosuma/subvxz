Naia is believed to be
13,000 years old,

11:01.261 --> 11:05.563

ever discovered in the Americas,

deep underwater,

100 to 105 pounds,

20:57.657 --> 20:59.056
but with much
of the key evidence

20:59.058 --> 21:02.260
buried beneath rising waters,

21:02.262 --> 21:04.562
I'm turning to legends
and oral histories

21:04.564 --> 21:07.064
to try and piece together
this lost time.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.833
This smells of sage,
lavender.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.368
I do smell
something.

21:12.405 --> 21:16.274
[ Singing

21:21.681 --> 21:24.649
Chief Joseph Riverwind
is from the Arawak Tribe

21:24.651 --> 21:29.453
and is an author and expert
on Native American oral history.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.256
His wife, Laralyn,
is a doctor of natural medicine

21:32.258 --> 21:33.991
from the Cherokee people.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.463
We've been looking into
the whole idea of

21:39.465 --> 21:42.967
when did people start
to populate the Americas.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.703
When did that happen,
and who were those people?

21:45.705 --> 21:48.072
And I know if someone had
a oral tradition

21:48.074 --> 21:50.207
that there was treasure buried
in the backyard

21:50.209 --> 21:51.709
of a house that I built,

21:51.711 --> 21:54.912
I would go dig up exactly
where the tradition says it is.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.514
Like, why wouldn't I do that?
-Right.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.683
And I feel like there's,
you know,

21:58.685 --> 22:02.219
there's so much there
to explore.

22:02.221 --> 22:06.524
Native Americans populated
this area over 3,000 years ago

22:06.526 --> 22:09.460
and have recently been proven
to have direct DNA connections

22:09.462 --> 22:12.963
to some of the earliest humans
in America,

22:12.965 --> 22:15.366
but the legends and stories
of Native Americans

22:15.368 --> 22:18.903
might tell us more than
modern science ever can.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.738
Well,
the understanding

22:20.740 --> 22:22.506
of how oral tradition
is passed down --

22:22.508 --> 22:25.076
it isn't just telling
the story around a campfire,

22:25.078 --> 22:26.744
which obviously would change
with each person

22:26.746 --> 22:27.912
that hears the story.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.648
The stories are learned
word for word,

22:30.650 --> 22:32.950
so when we hear
a traditional story,

22:32.952 --> 22:34.952
it's the same as we heard it
500 years ago

22:34.954 --> 22:37.221
or 1,000 years ago
or 2,000 years ago.

22:37.223 --> 22:39.256
There's an integrity
that's kept to it.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.759
So, what is the truth
in your oral traditions?

22:41.761 --> 22:44.161
When did people
come into the Americas?

22:44.163 --> 22:45.496
So, in oral tradition,

22:45.498 --> 22:48.065
our stories say that the land
was all one piece,

22:48.067 --> 22:50.267
one solid land mass,
and we were all one tribe.

22:50.269 --> 22:51.669
We were all
one people.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.003
But then our people
tried to build

22:53.005 --> 22:55.005
what we called a sky tower
to the creator,

22:55.007 --> 22:57.308
and Creator became angry
with the people.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.576
LARALYN:

22:58.578 --> 23:01.946

to build a great canoe

23:05.551 --> 23:07.752
and put two
of every animal in it...
Mm, mm-hmm.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.354
...because he would be
flooding the Earth.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.356
FOX: These various
Native American stories

23:12.358 --> 23:14.658
all seem to line up
with what science tells us

23:14.660 --> 23:17.294
about Earth's history.

23:17.296 --> 23:20.564
There was an ice age
where the lands were connected.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.066
This ice melted.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.300
Sea levels rose,

23:23.302 --> 23:26.837
and massive floods
spread across the world.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.840
Although these oral traditions
credit the gods,

23:29.842 --> 23:33.277
they're reporting on
the same events.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.745
Well,
you've got native tribes

23:34.747 --> 23:36.380
who say we've been here
for thousands of years,

23:36.382 --> 23:40.751
so I think that more and more
people are beginning to listen

23:40.753 --> 23:43.521
and to hear what
our people have to say.

23:43.523 --> 23:47.258
So, what does oral tradition
say about who those people were

23:47.260 --> 23:48.359
that were here?

23:48.361 --> 23:51.395
There's a heavy
oral tradition

23:51.397 --> 23:57.568
of "other" beings
within native storytelling,

23:57.570 --> 23:58.803
and I don't even want to
call them a race.

23:58.805 --> 24:02.273
It's a species because
they're not just human.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.908
They're hybrid.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.910
And these stories were found,
you know, the [Indistinct]

24:05.912 --> 24:07.945

the Cherokee,

24:07.947 --> 24:10.181
the Navajo, the Lakota,

24:10.183 --> 24:11.615
but you have
this whole race of giants

24:11.617 --> 24:14.852
that populated the land,
and they were not good.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.054
They were very sadistic.
They were very evil.

24:17.056 --> 24:20.558
Muskogee called the giants
isti papa,

24:20.560 --> 24:22.560
which means "man-eater"...
-Mm.

24:22.562 --> 24:26.197
...and they were notorious
for taking children and...

24:26.199 --> 24:27.631
-Mm.
-...making meals of them.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.034
They would grab a warrior
and just bite his head off

24:30.036 --> 24:31.502
and drink the blood.
Ugh.

24:31.504 --> 24:33.204
I mean, these guys were,
like, 9 foot, 10 foot tall.

24:33.206 --> 24:34.505
-Yeah.
-It was just...

24:34.507 --> 24:36.240
-Sometimes bigger.
-Yeah, sometimes bigger.

24:36.242 --> 24:39.243
And they're in almost
all of the Native stories.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.212
You ask a Native person,
"Who built this big mound

24:41.214 --> 24:42.746
or this Indian mound
over here?"

24:42.748 --> 24:44.381

According to the Riverwinds,

24:47.186 --> 24:49.019
giants are all over
the oral histories

24:49.021 --> 24:51.222
of dozens of Native tribes

24:51.224 --> 24:53.624
from the Iroquois
in the northeast

24:53.626 --> 24:56.026
to the Comanches
in the Great Plains

24:56.028 --> 24:59.230
to the Navajo in the southwest.

24:59.232 --> 25:02.199
These tribes were
hundreds of miles apart,

25:02.201 --> 25:04.568
but all shared a common story

25:04.570 --> 25:09.106
that early man

like, coming from
a scientific background?

25:17.283 --> 25:21.085
LARALYN:
I think there's some hesitancy
in the scientific community

25:21.087 --> 25:23.988
of believing oral tradition.

25:23.990 --> 25:28.225

the possibility

27:24.343 --> 27:26.443
that giants existed

29:17.957 --> 29:19.623
have all been seven feet.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.725
The tallest one
was eight feet.

29:21.727 --> 29:24.595
To play devil's advocate,
there's a lot of NBA players

29:24.597 --> 29:27.531
and athletes that are
in the seven-foot range,

29:27.533 --> 29:29.867
and they don't have
the gigantism,

29:29.869 --> 29:31.835
so are these
really giants,

29:31.837 --> 29:34.138
or are these
just larger people

29:34.140 --> 29:36.673

we have walking around today?

29:36.675 --> 29:39.109
The incidents of seven-foot
and taller people

29:39.111 --> 29:40.778
that were found
in the burial mounds

29:40.780 --> 29:42.546
is a much higher proportion

29:42.548 --> 29:44.982
than the smaller slice
of seven-foot and taller people

29:44.984 --> 29:46.316
you see today.
Yeah.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.785
And a lot of them
were described

29:47.787 --> 29:49.953
as enormous
with massive jaws,

29:49.955 --> 29:53.223
massive skulls,
massive bone structure,

29:53.225 --> 29:55.292
like almost
some kind of,

29:55.294 --> 29:57.728

That's

30:07.072 --> 30:09.339
and it was listed in several
other academic journals.

30:09.341 --> 30:12.309
Is there any evidence of where
that skeleton went?

30:12.311 --> 30:14.178
Did they put it back
where they got it?

30:14.180 --> 30:18.115
In 1990, there was the
Native American Graves
and Repatriation Act

30:18.117 --> 30:20.918
to protect
Native American remains,

30:20.920 --> 30:22.986

went back in the ground.

they just can't be found.

was found

30:28.260 --> 30:30.460
in a Native American
burial mound

30:30.462 --> 30:33.297
and removed without the
permission of the Shawnee Tribe

30:33.299 --> 30:35.432
that the land belonged to.

30:35.434 --> 30:38.135
With the passing
of a new law in 1990,

30:38.137 --> 30:40.237
the remains were returned
to the tribe

in America,

30:46.312 --> 30:48.712

we have another player

30:51.684 --> 30:53.350

30:53.352 --> 30:56.353
and they were found in this area

30:56.355 --> 30:57.888

the Denisovans,

30:57.890 --> 30:59.890

large beings that were here

30:59.892 --> 31:02.492

31:02.494 --> 31:05.128

There's no question.

that they thought

31:37.596 --> 31:39.162
it was a tooth
of a cave bear,

31:39.164 --> 31:41.198

the Max Planck Institute,

So, according to this theory,

31:55.047 --> 31:56.513
50,000 years ago,

31:56.515 --> 31:59.449
a large human-like species
called Denisovans

31:59.451 --> 32:02.486

32:02.488 --> 32:05.656
These ancient giants migrated
into the Americans

hundreds of broken

from a mastodon,

This is a map

Yes, we did.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.674
of 130,000
plus or minus 9,000.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.879

35:48.881 --> 35:52.382
Oh, my God.
It's so ancient.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.184
130,000 years ago,

35:54.186 --> 35:57.053
it's believed that humans
were extremely primitive

35:57.055 --> 35:58.321
and lived only in Africa,

35:58.323 --> 36:01.124
parts of Europe,
and southern Asia,

36:01.126 --> 36:04.794
but these ancient bones
aren't just extremely old.

36:04.796 --> 36:09.733
They're like nothing else
Tom has ever seen.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.702
So, what's interesting is
we have parts of femurs,

36:12.704 --> 36:14.771
but they're broken,
sharply broken,

36:14.773 --> 36:19.342
so that's just a piece of one
of these 3-foot-long leg bones.

36:19.344 --> 36:20.877
Yeah.
And that's
all we found.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.547
Found pieces of it, and even
the pieces that we did find

36:23.549 --> 36:27.050
could not be put back together
to form a complete femur,

36:27.052 --> 36:29.419
so that
was a real puzzle,

36:29.421 --> 36:31.087
and that
was the real indication

36:31.089 --> 36:34.424
that this site
was really unique.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.793
Usually when mastodons
are found underground,

36:36.795 --> 36:38.628
the skeletons
are partially intact

36:38.630 --> 36:40.864
and all in
the same general area,

36:40.866 --> 36:44.301
but this mastodon was broken
into over 300 pieces

36:44.303 --> 36:48.371
and spread across 400 feet.

36:48.373 --> 36:52.342
Even more unusual was the fact
that the ribs were intact,

36:52.344 --> 36:57.380
but the legs and femurs were
broken into dozens of pieces.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.183
So, we posed in our minds
several different hypotheses

37:00.185 --> 37:03.954
to explain
what caused this --

37:03.956 --> 37:07.357
fast-flowing streams
carrying sediment and rocks

37:07.359 --> 37:10.527
and perhaps the carcass
and burying the carcass.

37:10.529 --> 37:13.163
If this is all due to
just fast-flowing water,

37:13.165 --> 37:17.267
we wouldn't find ribs intact
and leg bones broken.

37:17.269 --> 37:19.903
We'd find legs intact
and ribs broken.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.605
-'Cause ribs are more fragile.
-Right.

37:21.607 --> 37:24.741
So, a purely
geological explanation

37:24.743 --> 37:27.611
in terms of
just water flowing didn't fit,

37:27.613 --> 37:29.813
and so we thought
of other scenarios,

37:29.815 --> 37:31.181
one of which is trampling,

37:31.183 --> 37:34.217
but we didn't see
any marks on the bones

37:34.219 --> 37:35.252
that suggest trampling.

37:35.254 --> 37:37.053
We kept coming back
to this idea

37:37.055 --> 37:42.459
that, well, humans perhaps
were responsible for this

37:42.461 --> 37:45.895
because not only did we find
bones and teeth and tusks,

37:45.897 --> 37:48.331
but we also found
five large cobbles --

37:48.333 --> 37:50.166
rocks about 30 pounds --

37:50.168 --> 37:52.469
and the rocks
really stand out as an anomaly

37:52.471 --> 37:55.672
and part of the story
that's really quite intriguing.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.208
These five large cobbles
were found here

37:58.210 --> 38:02.279
in this cluster
of broken leg bones.

38:02.281 --> 38:03.747
This suggests
that the breakage

38:03.749 --> 38:05.982
was occurring
at this location,

38:05.984 --> 38:08.752
telltale signs that would
indicate human activity.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.920
That's really amazing.

38:10.922 --> 38:14.357
FOX:
The five large rocks found
by the mastodon skeleton

38:14.359 --> 38:17.060
are not naturally occurring
within the sediment layer

38:17.062 --> 38:19.963
where the bones were found,

38:19.965 --> 38:22.265
so Tom and his team believe
that early humans

38:22.267 --> 38:24.401
used these as tools
to break apart

38:24.403 --> 38:26.569
the large femurs
of the mastodon,

38:26.571 --> 38:29.139
explaining
the strange bone patterns.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.940
130,000 is...
Mm-hmm.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.143
...much older than humans
were thought to have been

38:33.145 --> 38:35.312
in the New World.
Much, much older.

38:35.314 --> 38:37.547
Much, much older,
by an order of magnitude.
Yeah.

38:37.549 --> 38:41.251
And that's where
it became pretty exciting.

38:41.253 --> 38:43.453
This is astounding.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.088
If Tom is right,

38:45.090 --> 38:48.191
our history books weren't off
by 3,000 years.

38:48.193 --> 38:51.928
They were off by more than
100,000 years.

38:51.930 --> 38:54.864
This completely shatters all
other archaeological theories

38:54.866 --> 38:58.968

first arrived in America.

38:58.970 --> 39:02.305
How has it
been received?

39:02.307 --> 39:04.274
Well, it's had
mixed reviews.

39:04.276 --> 39:06.876
Most of the reaction
has been very negative

39:06.878 --> 39:09.846
because it goes against
the existing paradigm,

39:09.848 --> 39:11.414
and one
of our suggestions is

39:11.416 --> 39:13.516
that paleontologists
discovered this

39:13.518 --> 39:14.984
'cause they're
working in deposits

39:14.986 --> 39:17.087
that are
130,000 years old,

39:17.089 --> 39:19.222

don't look in sediments

39:19.224 --> 39:20.757

130,000 years old.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.592

well, let's start

39:22.594 --> 39:24.794
looking in older deposits

39:24.796 --> 39:27.697
'cause if you don't look,
you're not gonna find evidence.

39:27.699 --> 39:28.832
-Yeah.
-What if we're right?

39:28.834 --> 39:29.999
I mean,
that's pretty exciting,

39:30.001 --> 39:31.234

change everything.

the evidence is there.
