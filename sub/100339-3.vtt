WEBVTT

00:02.897 --> 00:06.252
I baptise you
in the name of the Father...

00:06.292 --> 00:07.370
...and the Son...

00:08.370 --> 00:09.810
...and the Holy Ghost.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.209
Amen.

00:23.369 --> 00:24.770
There is no greater love on Earth

00:24.810 --> 00:26.970
than that of a child
for their parent.

00:27.010 --> 00:31.209
They look to us for guidance,
comfort and unwavering support.

00:36.810 --> 00:40.249
You are their safe harbour,
never forget that.

00:42.289 --> 00:44.529
Your role as parents is a gift.

00:44.569 --> 00:48.410
You have been chosen
to help shape a young life,

00:48.450 --> 00:50.810
to guide them on the right path.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.730
Who knows
what Nancy will grow up to become?

00:54.209 --> 00:56.770
You can help make
her dreams a reality,

00:56.810 --> 00:58.810
with one vital ingredient.

00:59.889 --> 01:01.410
Love.

01:01.450 --> 01:04.929
Bit heavy on your toes this morning.
Oh, yes, this will help.

01:04.968 --> 01:07.929
Late night?
Yeah, try no sleep at all.

01:09.009 --> 01:10.770
You devil! Who was she?

01:10.809 --> 01:12.610
No, no, nothing like that,
I'm afraid.

01:15.770 --> 01:17.530
I think my mum's disowned me, Vic.

01:18.569 --> 01:20.449
It'll blow over,
these things always do.

01:20.490 --> 01:22.890
No. No, I think this is it.

01:23.970 --> 01:25.289
I think she's done with me.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.330
I've got two words for you, Will.

01:29.369 --> 01:30.530
Sod her.

01:31.649 --> 01:33.209
No, I mean it.

01:33.250 --> 01:35.970
My dad left when I was six,
my mum couldn't give a damn.

01:36.009 --> 01:38.569
Sod 'em, sod 'em both.

01:38.610 --> 01:40.970
The gospel according to Saint Vic.

01:41.009 --> 01:43.890
You've got your own life to live,
bloody well live it.

01:50.330 --> 01:52.610
Oh, I wouldn't mind seeing that.

01:54.050 --> 01:55.970
I get enough of that at work.

01:58.929 --> 02:02.209
I don't know, he just was there.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.130
Miss Grainger?
Where is he?

02:04.169 --> 02:06.369
Um, Betsey, yes.

02:06.410 --> 02:08.410
Inspector Keating,
you reported a break-in?

02:09.610 --> 02:11.169
There was this Indian fella,

02:11.209 --> 02:13.729
walked down the stairs,
bold as brass he was.

02:13.769 --> 02:16.130
I don't know how he got in,
we weren't even open.

02:16.169 --> 02:18.530
Is he still on the premises?
Isn't that your job?

02:20.410 --> 02:22.090
Take the alley.

02:24.609 --> 02:26.850
Let's see if your Indian man
is still here.

02:38.489 --> 02:40.370
Anything of value in here?

02:40.410 --> 02:44.130
Nothing, except these two beauties,
they're priceless. To me, anyway.

02:46.449 --> 02:47.650
Why is there two?

02:47.690 --> 02:51.609
Oh, it's a changeover system.
One reel plays, I ready the other.

02:51.650 --> 02:54.049
I'm like the Wizard of Oz
behind the curtain,

02:54.090 --> 02:55.609
keeping the dream alive.

02:58.489 --> 03:00.769
Where did you spring from?
Fire escape alley.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.810
The lock on the door downstairs
is knackered.

03:02.850 --> 03:06.130
Eurgh, yes, I keep meaning
to tell head office about that.

03:06.169 --> 03:10.370
You're a long way from home, Mr...?
Rogers, Wyatt.

03:10.410 --> 03:13.090
I can't tell you how much
I miss the Hollywood sunshine.

03:13.130 --> 03:14.449
And the magic of Tinseltown.

03:16.690 --> 03:18.250
Is this anything to do with you?

03:18.289 --> 03:20.729
It wasn't here last night
when I left.

03:20.769 --> 03:24.410
Someone's been sleeping here.
There's your answer.

03:24.449 --> 03:26.009
A vagrant, probably.

03:26.049 --> 03:28.210
Let's check
the rest of the building.

03:42.970 --> 03:44.930
So, are you an actor?

03:44.970 --> 03:48.530
Screenwriter. Well, was.
Call it a sabbatical.

03:50.090 --> 03:53.889
As a projectionist?
I'm on the blacklist.

03:53.930 --> 03:57.009
Just another victim
of Senator McCarthy's witch-hunt.

03:57.049 --> 03:58.810
They think you're a witch?

04:00.609 --> 04:02.970
Don't they have a news section
in The Beano, Larry?

04:04.049 --> 04:05.970
Have you met anybody famous?

04:06.009 --> 04:09.210
Marlon Brando's a sweet guy.
Doris Day's a gas.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.210
John Wayne, not so much.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.410
If I'd half a crown
every time I heard this story.

04:13.449 --> 04:16.850
If I'd half a crown every time
you asked me to repeat it.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.048
No sign of your intruder.

04:19.089 --> 04:21.369
I think Miss Grainger
scared him off.

04:21.410 --> 04:24.410
If only I'd known.
We all need a little charity.

04:25.450 --> 04:28.850
It's what makes us tick, right?
It's the beauty of this place.

04:30.010 --> 04:31.809
Transports us to new worlds.

04:32.970 --> 04:34.450
We forget ourselves, and yet...

04:36.010 --> 04:37.890
...it's us we search for up there.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.850
Exposing us to feelings
we never thought we'd know.

04:40.890 --> 04:42.809
Boredom, mostly.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.770
The public are banging
on the doors for the matinee.

04:46.970 --> 04:48.210
So, let them in, then.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.570
We'll leave you to it.

04:54.609 --> 04:56.770
Any chance you can get me
Brando's autograph?

05:02.530 --> 05:04.010
Just coming.

05:09.289 --> 05:11.289
I hope this buttercream
is not too stiff,

05:11.330 --> 05:12.809
or I'll not hear the end of it.

05:12.850 --> 05:15.770
You worry too much.
You have met Mrs Bennett?

05:26.929 --> 05:29.450
Drive slowly,
I don't want this on my lap.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.689
You made it.
I'm here with Larry.

05:51.369 --> 05:53.609
You're so easy to tease.

05:53.650 --> 05:56.210
Have you been eating popcorn?
Why? What?

05:57.570 --> 05:59.729
You're so easy to tease.
Oh, shut up.

06:01.289 --> 06:03.210
Vic. Good to see you.

06:03.249 --> 06:06.450
This is my lovely wife, Marie.
Pleasure to meet you at last.

06:06.489 --> 06:08.929
Likewise.
Vic won't shut up about you.

06:08.970 --> 06:11.289
Sounds like I've got competition.
We both do, honestly,

06:11.330 --> 06:13.489
it's all I hear,
Will this, Will that.

06:13.530 --> 06:16.369
Who knew there was so much to say?
This is Ellie Harding.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.489
Hi.

06:17.530 --> 06:19.689
Taking advice from the gospel,
I see.

06:19.729 --> 06:22.010
I'll make sure my lot
don't cramp your style.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.850
Oh, look at him!

06:23.890 --> 06:25.609
Oh, you scrub up well.

06:25.650 --> 06:27.929
Yeah, well, someone's
got to show you how it's done.

06:39.770 --> 06:42.650
Now, give it here!
Cigarette, sir?

06:48.410 --> 06:51.729
'Hero, come.'
'I'm not too keen on pets.'

06:51.770 --> 06:53.970
'Never mind, you stay where you are,
I'll get him.'

07:00.450 --> 07:03.530
Ciggies, handsome?
We're fine, thank you.

07:04.770 --> 07:06.410
Are you sure I can't tempt you?

07:07.609 --> 07:10.289
He's got all the temptation
he needs, thanks.

07:15.890 --> 07:18.530
'Good morning, Louis.'
'Mummy... '

07:19.809 --> 07:22.330
'I'm so sorry
you've been disturbed.'

07:23.890 --> 07:26.809
Your cup of cocoa,
with a dash of cream.

07:26.850 --> 07:28.289
Oh...

07:28.330 --> 07:30.689
Whatever did I do to deserve you?

07:32.249 --> 07:34.210
What in heaven's name?

07:35.289 --> 07:38.410
There's a man, Jack!
There's a man in our garden.

07:39.530 --> 07:40.530
Hey!

07:41.609 --> 07:42.970
Hey!

07:44.410 --> 07:45.689
Coward!

07:46.850 --> 07:50.369
'Bye-bye, thanks
for the nice tea, and everything.'

07:50.410 --> 07:52.049
'Goodbye.'
'Goodbye.'

07:57.530 --> 07:59.809
'What is that woman playing at?'

08:01.609 --> 08:04.010
'You're stuck in the door...'

08:04.049 --> 08:06.609
'Well, ring the bell,
Brains, don't just stand there.'

08:07.929 --> 08:09.410
'Thank you.'

08:20.809 --> 08:25.809
It's probably just a hitch.
So far, so disastrous.

08:25.850 --> 08:28.609
I don't know,
I'd say it's going pretty well.

08:30.129 --> 08:32.570
You do know he's a vicar?
So?

08:32.609 --> 08:36.090
Well, he's off-limits downstairs.
Unlike me, on the other hand.

08:36.129 --> 08:38.929
You need to work on
your chat-up lines.

08:38.970 --> 08:40.529
I wasn't talking to you.

08:48.690 --> 08:51.369
Help me! It won't stop bleeding.

08:53.050 --> 08:54.489
I'll call for an ambulance.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.409
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

09:05.445 --> 09:08.084
Please,
will you all remain in the foyer?

09:08.124 --> 09:11.084
It's a good job you're here.
That poor mite's in over his head.

09:12.165 --> 09:14.685
It's your lot.
Could you give him a hand?

09:14.724 --> 09:17.244
Looks like
he could do with a stiff drink.

09:17.285 --> 09:21.045
Ellie, always one step ahead.
I don't know how you do it.

09:21.084 --> 09:23.724
Who tipped you off this time?
Actually, I...

09:23.765 --> 09:25.484
We're, um...

09:25.525 --> 09:27.204
Oh, I see.

09:28.645 --> 09:30.445
Get some statements, would you?

09:34.565 --> 09:37.045
That's one way
of letting him down gently.

09:37.084 --> 09:40.724
I thought you said she was immoral?
I said what she did was immoral.

09:44.204 --> 09:46.925
Excuse me, ladies, if you could wait
to speak to the inspector...

09:46.964 --> 09:48.604
If you need to talk, then...
Ellie.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.765
It's Miss Grainger, isn't it?

09:59.525 --> 10:03.004
Oh, don't mind us, Mr...?
Parker.

10:04.364 --> 10:06.204
Edwin Parker.

10:08.405 --> 10:10.645
I understand you found the body,
is that right?

10:11.765 --> 10:15.045
Did either of you see anyone come
or go from the projection booth?

10:15.084 --> 10:16.244
I arrived late from my break

10:16.285 --> 10:18.445
and went straight
into the auditorium.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.124
I was in here.

10:20.165 --> 10:23.285
I can't be sure, but I think
I saw that Indian fella.

10:23.325 --> 10:26.445
Oh, my God. It could have been me.

10:27.925 --> 10:30.964
Did Wyatt ever mention any dealings
with this Indian fella before?

10:32.084 --> 10:36.124
I only started last month.
Typing pool before that.

10:37.165 --> 10:38.244
A bunch of wallflowers,

10:38.285 --> 10:40.445
counting down the days
till they get married off.

10:40.484 --> 10:42.124
Talk about the death of hope.

10:42.165 --> 10:44.805
Wyatt kept himself to himself.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.484
This place was his second home.

10:49.445 --> 10:51.004
Here, look, mine's clean.

10:52.925 --> 10:57.124
Silly, isn't it?
I only knew him for five minutes.

10:57.165 --> 11:00.364
Some people
can still make quite an impact.

11:00.405 --> 11:02.925
This Indian man,
what did he look like?

11:07.925 --> 11:09.325
Err...

11:09.364 --> 11:11.884
He was just dark, obviously.

11:11.925 --> 11:15.405
Scrawny looking, navy suit.

11:15.445 --> 11:18.124
Get on the radio,
circulate a description.

11:23.445 --> 11:25.045
What time did you find the body?

11:26.565 --> 11:28.724
About quarter past eight,
give or take.

11:30.645 --> 11:32.445
Film started at seven thirty,

11:32.484 --> 11:35.045
two reels played
of a 90 minute film,

11:35.084 --> 11:36.964
that's, err...

11:37.004 --> 11:40.565
What? Roughly...
20 minutes each. Why?

11:41.805 --> 11:44.484
Wyatt was still alive
when he changed the second reel.

11:45.604 --> 11:48.805
Gives us a time of death
of about ten past eight.

11:52.405 --> 11:53.925
Rules out robbery.

12:05.685 --> 12:07.805
Distinguished service medal.

12:13.565 --> 12:17.765
Subedar Aasim Hassan.
At least we have a name.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.724
Subedar is not a name, it's a rank.

12:20.805 --> 12:22.204
Indian army.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.484
Perhaps this intruder
wasn't an intruder after all.

12:29.405 --> 12:31.244
Question is...

12:31.285 --> 12:33.445
how does he know
our American friend?

12:44.285 --> 12:46.805
Do you have to go
creeping around like that?

12:46.844 --> 12:49.244
What do you want? A fanfare
every time I enter the room.

12:49.285 --> 12:52.884
Someone threw a brick through
the Chapman's window last night.

12:52.925 --> 12:56.525
What?
Are you OK? Sit down, Mrs C.

12:56.565 --> 12:59.325
I don't want to sit down.
The young today.

12:59.364 --> 13:01.805
They lack rectitude,
that's the problem.

13:01.844 --> 13:04.285
This could be the thin end
of a monoecious wedge.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.204
And I don't need any
of your big words either, Leonard.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.204
Why would anyone want to hurt you?

13:09.244 --> 13:11.445
No one needs a reason these days,
it seems.

13:11.484 --> 13:14.405
Talk to Geordie.
Jack doesn't want to make a fuss.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.844
You won't be making a fuss.

13:16.884 --> 13:18.604
No, it's done.

13:18.645 --> 13:20.805
I will not be cowed
by a little brown man

13:20.844 --> 13:22.565
in a moth-eaten suit.

13:23.805 --> 13:25.565
We will not be cowed.

13:34.805 --> 13:36.565
Have you seen my name badge
anywhere?

13:36.604 --> 13:39.805
Oh, yeah, it's on the side
with your handbag and keys.

13:39.844 --> 13:42.084
Shall I get fish and chips tonight
on my way home?

13:42.124 --> 13:43.124
Friday night treat.

13:43.165 --> 13:45.805
Actually, I thought
we'd eat ours on the beach.

13:45.844 --> 13:48.124
Clacton-on-Sea's
a hop, skip and a jump by bus.

13:48.165 --> 13:49.765
Oh, they've got school.

13:49.805 --> 13:52.724
Why are you not in your uniforms?
It's only one day.

13:53.765 --> 13:57.405
There are rules, Mum!
And rules are made to be broken.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.765
Please.
I said, "No".

14:01.805 --> 14:04.604
When was the last time
you and Geordie took them anywhere?

14:04.645 --> 14:07.685
Do you remember winning that
donkey race when you were nine?

14:07.724 --> 14:09.884
Barbara had a face
like a slapped leg.

14:11.004 --> 14:14.405
I kept the rosette on for a week,
just to rub her nose in it.

14:14.445 --> 14:15.645
Happy days.

14:17.364 --> 14:19.285
Please.

14:19.325 --> 14:23.244
All right, then. Back by four.
Be good!

14:23.285 --> 14:26.445
Esme, Esme!
And don't tell your father.

14:26.484 --> 14:28.724
We're going to the seaside.

14:28.765 --> 14:31.565
Is Geordie about? There's been
another sighting of your suspect.

14:31.604 --> 14:34.045
I know.
Keep up, vicar.

14:39.204 --> 14:41.405
Farmer found him
sleeping in his hayloft.

14:41.445 --> 14:44.124
Fast work, Larry.
I could say the same about you.

14:49.805 --> 14:52.645
Same surname as the medal,
different Christian name.

14:52.685 --> 14:54.364
Does he speak English?

14:54.405 --> 14:57.285
He didn't say a word in the car.
How's your Urdu?

14:57.325 --> 15:00.565
Oh, OK. I admit it,
I've been using too much Brylcream.

15:03.604 --> 15:05.165
Telephone the American Embassy,

15:05.204 --> 15:06.765
track down Wyatt Rogers'
next of kin.

15:06.805 --> 15:08.084
Yes, boss.

15:10.244 --> 15:13.244
Ooh, he's gunning for you.
So I gathered.

15:14.724 --> 15:17.405
Mr Hassan was picked up
outside Grantchester.

15:17.445 --> 15:19.604
It's plausible
he broke the Chapman's window.

15:20.685 --> 15:23.925
Two crimes solved in one day.
We'll be in the pub by lunchtime.

15:31.325 --> 15:34.844
You arrived within the last week.
What was your purpose here?

15:39.445 --> 15:42.724
You've got no money, no home.
So, why come?

15:49.204 --> 15:51.805
Give that back. It's my father's.

15:51.844 --> 15:54.884
So, you do speak English?
Do you like playing silly buggers?

15:54.925 --> 15:57.285
It's the only thing I have left
to remember him by.

15:57.325 --> 15:58.525
He was a soldier?

15:58.565 --> 16:01.124
He fought alongside the British,
El Alamein.

16:02.325 --> 16:03.645
Tough campaign, ey?

16:03.685 --> 16:06.204
He had respect
for their principles and integrity.

16:06.244 --> 16:08.204
He was wrong on both counts.

16:08.244 --> 16:10.484
What was it doing
in the victim's pocket?

16:10.525 --> 16:13.445
I must have dropped it in the
projection booth, I don't know.

16:13.484 --> 16:16.165
I-I... heard someone come, I ran.

16:16.204 --> 16:18.685
We have witnesses that put you
at the cinema last night, too.

16:19.925 --> 16:22.685
They're mistaken, I wasn't there.
Then where were you?

16:24.964 --> 16:27.124
Was it you
who broke the Chapman's window?

16:28.405 --> 16:31.084
Do you know what you get in this
country for murder, Mr Hassan?

16:32.165 --> 16:34.724
The death penalty.
You're trying to pin this on me?

16:34.765 --> 16:37.204
The inspector is just trying
to understand what happened.

16:38.884 --> 16:40.565
You have no interest in the truth.

16:42.525 --> 16:43.964
You British are all liars.

16:46.604 --> 16:48.604
Would you really murder someone
over a medal?

16:49.685 --> 16:51.925
Well, you can't put a price
on sentiment.

16:51.964 --> 16:53.805
Some people can't let go
of their parents.

16:53.844 --> 16:56.084
I'm going to take your word for it.

16:56.124 --> 16:58.325
Your mother still going kamikaze
with St John, then?

16:58.364 --> 16:59.724
Ah, it's her life.

17:00.884 --> 17:03.404
Why would you make the journey
all the way from Pakistan,

17:03.444 --> 17:05.805
to end up in Grantchester,
of all places?

17:05.844 --> 17:07.244
Unless you had a reason.

17:10.644 --> 17:12.805
Let's see if Wyatt can tell us.

17:19.045 --> 17:21.204
He certainly lived
the Hollywood dream.

17:22.325 --> 17:24.325
What are we looking for, exactly?

17:24.364 --> 17:27.604
Anything that might connect
our murder victim to Mr Hassan.

17:27.644 --> 17:29.084
Quiet a dent.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.245
One way to solve writer's block.

17:42.285 --> 17:43.404
Our debonair Mr Rogers

17:43.444 --> 17:45.765
didn't strike me as the type
to sleep with a teddy bear.

17:53.485 --> 17:58.005
Ooh. Cristal. None of your rubbish.
You would know.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.765
What's an exiled screenwriter
doing living the high life

18:01.805 --> 18:03.444
on a projectionist's wage?

18:09.285 --> 18:11.444
Lipstick marks.
Hmm?

18:13.604 --> 18:17.965
New relationship, then.
Lipstick and bubbly.

18:18.005 --> 18:21.404
Before you know it, it's
a cup of cocoa and an early night.

18:21.444 --> 18:24.805
With who?
Edwin said he never left the cinema.

18:33.725 --> 18:34.965
Take your pick.

18:36.725 --> 18:39.924
Can't it wait?
I've got a matinee in ten minutes.

18:41.805 --> 18:43.924
You said you hardly knew him.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.205
I'm sorry, I...

18:49.285 --> 18:50.325
I didn't mean to.

18:52.684 --> 18:53.844
It was early days.

18:55.205 --> 18:57.205
A kiss and a cuddle
in the projection booth.

18:57.245 --> 19:00.124
And a night in his flat.
I'm not a tart.

19:04.404 --> 19:05.884
Wyatt bought me champagne.

19:07.404 --> 19:09.965
No-one's ever
bought me champagne before.

19:10.005 --> 19:12.245
A lot of blokes
want to get their leg over...

19:13.485 --> 19:15.805
...not many treat you like
a film star while they're at it.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.924
But why keep it quiet?

19:21.525 --> 19:25.084
Edwin.
He can be a little bit intense.

19:25.124 --> 19:27.644
Ah. Jealous type, is he?

19:27.684 --> 19:31.164
He's a little creep.
I catch him staring at me sometimes.

19:31.205 --> 19:32.725
And you, Miss Grainger...

19:34.604 --> 19:36.725
...are you the jealous type?

19:39.005 --> 19:41.364
Made up your mind about me,
haven't you, Inspector?

19:43.844 --> 19:48.084
This lot was found
in Wyatt's little trophy cabinet.

19:49.245 --> 19:51.364
Under his bed.

19:54.844 --> 19:56.525
They're head shots.

19:56.565 --> 19:59.084
Wyatt took them
for a Hollywood agent friend of his.

20:00.525 --> 20:02.805
Said he'd fly me out
for a screen test.

20:02.844 --> 20:04.245
Said I had potential.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.844
Oh, it's all here in...

20:07.884 --> 20:09.084
black and white.

20:12.164 --> 20:14.525
"Thank you for submitting
your photo and resume.

20:14.565 --> 20:17.325
"You remind me very much
of a young Marilyn Monroe."

20:17.364 --> 20:19.644
Maybe if he'd only seen the photo.

20:19.684 --> 20:22.884
Is there a name?
Marcus Remington.

20:22.924 --> 20:25.565
The Remington partnership,
Wiltshire Boulevard.

20:25.604 --> 20:27.844
Why anyone would want to be famous
is beyond me.

20:27.884 --> 20:29.205
Life's not your own.

20:29.245 --> 20:31.844
All that money and adoration
must be terrible (!)

20:31.884 --> 20:34.725
Look who's got his hand in the till.

20:34.765 --> 20:36.124
Can I help you?

20:37.525 --> 20:38.725
Turn out your pockets.

20:38.765 --> 20:41.364
Hey, what happened
to the presumption of innocence, hm?

20:42.844 --> 20:44.205
You were saying?

20:48.565 --> 20:50.805
Matt, stop.

20:50.844 --> 20:53.285
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't give up on you.

20:57.884 --> 21:00.005
I think he just gave you two.

21:10.325 --> 21:12.604
A rat always finds its way back
to the nest.

21:12.644 --> 21:14.525
Not helpful, Geordie.
What's going on?

21:15.644 --> 21:17.644
I caught him
stealing from the cinema till.

21:17.684 --> 21:19.844
Crawling with bobbies
after last night.

21:19.884 --> 21:23.084
Not exactly brain of Britain.
Oh, mate, you didn't, did you?

21:25.844 --> 21:28.684
Oh, well. Win some, lose some.

21:30.765 --> 21:32.444
If only my job was always this easy.

21:32.485 --> 21:34.644
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

21:34.684 --> 21:37.404
You like it here.
why are you throwing it all away?

21:38.924 --> 21:41.805
If anyone is to blame, it's me.
Really?

21:42.844 --> 21:44.644
It's the running costs
of this place.

21:44.684 --> 21:46.285
They are through the roof, and...

21:46.325 --> 21:48.884
we've been rowing in front
of the boys, haven't we, love?

21:50.285 --> 21:53.364
Matthew did it for us.
Where's the money?

21:55.765 --> 21:58.164
I threw it away.
You threw it away?

21:58.205 --> 22:00.924
Nice try, Vic.
Wait, can we at least discuss this?

22:00.965 --> 22:03.205
Matthew Butler,
I'm arresting you for larceny.

22:06.844 --> 22:09.444
Are you coming?
No.

22:10.525 --> 22:12.164
See you later, then.

22:14.364 --> 22:15.884
Are things that bad?

22:15.924 --> 22:18.364
I didn't want to burden you.
We're friends, Vic.

22:20.884 --> 22:22.485
They're pretty bad.

22:22.525 --> 22:24.725
Will Geordie let Matt go
if I pay the cinema back?

22:26.164 --> 22:27.525
With what?

23:04.020 --> 23:07.379
It was in Matthew's locker.
I'm assuming it's all there.

23:08.859 --> 23:10.300
This doesn't change anything.

23:10.340 --> 23:11.820
If the cinema gets their money...

23:11.859 --> 23:13.459
If the Beaumont
want to press charges.

23:13.500 --> 23:17.699
So, have a word with them.
Please. For me.

23:19.379 --> 23:20.540
Boss.
Hmm.

23:20.580 --> 23:22.419
Mr and Mrs Chapman are here
for the ID parade.

23:22.459 --> 23:25.100
Bring them through.
Chase up the Yanks.

23:28.780 --> 23:31.379
I'll ask,
but don't hold your breath.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.780
Jack. Mrs C. Thanks for coming in.

23:41.820 --> 23:45.300
Far be it from me
to shirk a public duty.

23:45.340 --> 23:48.020
Right, Mrs C,
if you'd like to follow me.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.419
On my own?

23:51.179 --> 23:53.340
It was only you
that saw the suspect.

23:53.379 --> 23:55.820
Why don't I come with her?
Provide some moral support.

23:55.859 --> 23:58.379
It's not how it works, Jack.
I'd like that very much.

24:00.260 --> 24:01.699
I promise I won't say a word.

24:08.939 --> 24:11.300
If you recognise the gentleman
that broke your window,

24:11.340 --> 24:13.540
I'd like you to tap him
on the shoulder.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.540
Don't worry, I'm here.

24:21.859 --> 24:23.219
No.

24:28.419 --> 24:29.899
No, too tall.

24:37.619 --> 24:39.100
No. Too portly.

24:40.899 --> 24:42.100
Apologies.

24:52.419 --> 24:55.100
That's the brute,
I'd recognise him anywhere.

24:58.340 --> 25:00.179
I take it we're finished here.

25:13.540 --> 25:16.980
We need a full statement from you
before we can press charges.

25:17.020 --> 25:18.859
That won't be necessary.

25:20.060 --> 25:22.419
For an act of wanton vandalism?

25:22.459 --> 25:25.179
The poor man looks deluded, Sylvia.

25:25.219 --> 25:28.459
If you ask me,
he's in need of medical attention,

25:28.500 --> 25:30.100
not incarceration.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.540
It's the Christian thing to do.

25:36.780 --> 25:38.459
Whatever you think best.

25:38.500 --> 25:42.219
Well, if you change your mind.
The matter's closed, Inspector.

25:46.859 --> 25:48.619
Hello!

25:50.820 --> 25:52.619
Anybody home?

25:54.219 --> 25:55.859
Mum?

26:09.139 --> 26:11.859
Mrs C claims her window was broken
at quarter past eight.

26:11.899 --> 26:12.899
So?

26:12.939 --> 26:15.659
Wyatt was murdered
at around ten past eight.

26:15.699 --> 26:18.139
Even Roger Bannister
can't be in two places at once.

26:18.179 --> 26:20.379
What about
the medal in Wyatt's pocket?

26:20.419 --> 26:22.300
Perhaps Tariq's telling the truth.

26:22.340 --> 26:24.740
Perhaps he just dropped it
and Wyatt picked it up.

26:25.980 --> 26:28.139
I really don't have enough
to hold him at this rate.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.740
Humphrey Bogart would've had
this case wrapped up in two hours.

26:31.780 --> 26:32.939
Including intermission.

26:32.980 --> 26:35.780
Boss.
I contacted the American Embassy.

26:35.820 --> 26:37.060
And?

26:38.540 --> 26:40.179
Not a dicky bird.

26:40.219 --> 26:41.939
So, I spoke to the Beaumont
head office,

26:41.980 --> 26:44.419
got hold of Wyatt's
sister's address. Guess what?

26:44.459 --> 26:46.260
She lives just up the road
in Kettering.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.899
The only photo she had of him.
Their parents died when he was five.

26:51.939 --> 26:53.699
Car crash.

26:53.740 --> 26:54.939
They lost touch for a while,

26:54.980 --> 26:57.179
taken into different
children's homes.

26:57.219 --> 26:59.020
So, Wyatt's not even American.

27:00.459 --> 27:04.020
Hollywood connections.
I didn't believe a word of it.

27:05.060 --> 27:07.780
Larry was like a guppy
at feeding time.

27:07.820 --> 27:09.980
People believe
what they want to believe.

27:11.980 --> 27:13.740
Probably charging all those women

27:13.780 --> 27:16.980
through the nose
for his Hollywood connections.

27:17.020 --> 27:19.300
I can't stop thinking
about the teddy bear.

27:19.340 --> 27:23.300
Oh, yes? What,
fond memories of private school?

27:23.340 --> 27:24.820
You saw Wyatt's room.

27:24.859 --> 27:27.780
All that memorabilia,
it was like a film set.

27:27.820 --> 27:30.740
This teddy bear
is the last piece of his old life.

27:30.780 --> 27:32.340
So?

27:32.379 --> 27:34.859
So, I don't think
Wyatt was a conman.

27:34.899 --> 27:36.340
I think he was a fantasist.

27:36.379 --> 27:38.540
It's hardly a charmed childhood,
is it?

27:38.580 --> 27:40.939
Lose both your parents,
parted from your sister,

27:40.980 --> 27:43.500
suddenly your identity's gone,

27:43.540 --> 27:45.899
so why not invent something
he could be proud of?

27:45.939 --> 27:49.300
Financially, or not,
he still conned those women.

27:49.340 --> 27:52.020
Or, he wanted them to believe
in the best version of themselves.

27:52.060 --> 27:54.580
You're sounding more and more
like Vic.

27:54.619 --> 27:56.219
There are worse things.

27:58.580 --> 28:00.060
All right.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.580
We'll speak with
the blonde bombshell in the morning.

28:03.899 --> 28:06.260
And what about Matthew?
What about him?

28:08.219 --> 28:11.659
Nothing like a night in the cells
to focus the mind. Night.

28:25.780 --> 28:27.939
I was locked in here once.

28:27.980 --> 28:29.980
Geordie was the one who arrested me.

28:32.820 --> 28:33.899
If you say so.

28:33.939 --> 28:37.020
No, it's true.
Been friends ever since.

28:43.580 --> 28:46.219
Why steal money
and then throw it away, Matt?

28:48.859 --> 28:50.540
Do you know what I think it is?

28:53.899 --> 28:55.540
What?

28:55.580 --> 28:58.419
I expected too much of you.

28:58.459 --> 29:00.580
No-one can change overnight.

29:04.699 --> 29:07.060
Yeah... that's it.

29:09.219 --> 29:10.619
You expected too much of me.

29:11.899 --> 29:14.219
Tell your friend
I've got nothing to say.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.260
Good night.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.899
Come on. Here we are.

29:25.939 --> 29:28.859
Hello!
Where have you been?

29:28.899 --> 29:30.340
Oh, sorry, lost track of the time.

29:30.379 --> 29:32.740
You could have called
from a phone box.

29:32.780 --> 29:34.580
Oh, we had to run for the bus.

29:34.619 --> 29:37.780
The girls loved
splashing about in the water,

29:37.820 --> 29:39.419
didn't want to come home.
Liar!

29:39.459 --> 29:40.500
Esme.

29:40.540 --> 29:43.139
It was so embarrassing.
Singing on the bus.

29:43.179 --> 29:45.500
Everybody loves
'It's A Long Way to Tipperary'!

29:45.540 --> 29:48.060
Everyone was staring at us,
and then David went missing.

29:48.100 --> 29:51.100
What?
I turned my back for a moment...

29:51.139 --> 29:53.699
Dora and Ivy were crying,
I didn't know what to do.

29:53.740 --> 29:56.699
So dramatic.
Just like your mother.

29:56.740 --> 30:01.219
Oof.
Don't... you... dare.

30:01.260 --> 30:03.780
Hello!
Go on, upstairs.

30:09.540 --> 30:12.300
Hello, love. How was your day?

30:12.340 --> 30:14.580
Fine. You?

30:15.580 --> 30:17.379
Yeah, fine.

30:25.219 --> 30:26.899
Wait there, Mr Hassan.

30:37.659 --> 30:39.500
I want a word with you.

30:45.139 --> 30:47.260
You must be famished.

30:50.939 --> 30:51.980
There you go.
Thank you.

30:52.020 --> 30:53.060
Thank you.

30:54.459 --> 30:56.859
Miss Grainger,
sorry to bother you again.

30:56.899 --> 31:00.419
What is it this time?
Your head shots.

31:00.459 --> 31:04.659
Did Mr Rogers solicit money from you
for arranging them?

31:04.699 --> 31:06.500
He took them with his camera.

31:06.540 --> 31:08.859
Wyatt knew I didn't have
two farthings to rub together.

31:08.899 --> 31:10.699
None of us do.

31:10.740 --> 31:13.980
Edwin doesn't even get a wage.
He works here for nothing?

31:15.060 --> 31:17.980
You think head office would let that
bag of nerves near the public?

31:19.219 --> 31:24.020
Wyatt let him watch all the films
for free, such a big heart.

31:25.060 --> 31:27.020
He even gave him this medal
he found,

31:27.060 --> 31:29.619
reckoned it might be worth
something down the pawnshop.

31:45.580 --> 31:47.020
How do you know my husband?

31:49.619 --> 31:52.379
I didn't come down
with the last shower, Mr Hassan.

31:58.459 --> 32:00.260
My father was stationed in Amritsar.

32:01.939 --> 32:03.780
Mr Chapman was a civil servant,

32:03.820 --> 32:06.659
attached to the
Military Evacuation Organisation.

32:07.820 --> 32:09.060
Jack was in India?

32:09.100 --> 32:11.459
During the partition, yes.
Partition?

32:13.419 --> 32:17.419
The British divided our country
with a stroke of a pen.

32:17.459 --> 32:18.619
Do you know what it's like

32:18.659 --> 32:20.899
to find yourself
an enemy in your own country?

32:20.939 --> 32:24.419
I can't say that I do.
I was only 12 years old.

32:24.459 --> 32:26.139
The roads were run with blood.

32:27.260 --> 32:30.659
Uncles, aunties, school friends,
butchered like cattle.

32:32.100 --> 32:33.619
All in the name of religion.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.219
I'm sorry.

32:36.260 --> 32:38.939
But, what's this got to do
with Jack?

32:38.980 --> 32:41.540
There were more refugees
than trains to carry them.

32:41.580 --> 32:44.419
Mr Chapman commandeered a truck,

32:44.459 --> 32:47.340
drove families across the border,
for a price.

32:48.820 --> 32:51.300
No.
Jewellery, gold.

32:51.340 --> 32:53.060
They keep their value, you see.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.459
Are you sure
you've got the right man?

32:55.500 --> 32:57.820
Father was separated from us.

32:57.859 --> 33:00.619
My mother pleaded with Mr Chapman
to wait a few minutes,

33:00.659 --> 33:01.820
but he could not...

33:02.980 --> 33:04.820
My mother gave him her emerald ring

33:04.859 --> 33:07.540
as payment
to make the extra journey.

33:07.580 --> 33:09.219
It was her engagement ring.

33:10.580 --> 33:12.899
We heard a rumour
that my father was murdered

33:12.939 --> 33:14.540
before he could get to the truck.

33:16.219 --> 33:20.419
I want to know if that's true.
I need to know.

33:20.459 --> 33:22.139
So you can stop looking?

33:26.340 --> 33:27.699
I'm sorry for the window...

33:29.179 --> 33:31.020
...but your husband
refused to talk to me.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.980
He knew you were here?

33:35.419 --> 33:37.060
Guilty conscience.

33:38.340 --> 33:40.899
I'm so sorry, Mr Hassan.

33:45.780 --> 33:47.500
Please, give this to your mother.

33:49.020 --> 33:53.260
I hope it's of some consolation
to her.

34:05.619 --> 34:08.860
What's this?
An apology.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.819
I should have
consulted you yesterday.

34:10.860 --> 34:12.259
No, you were right.

34:12.299 --> 34:15.259
We should've called the men in
white coats when we had the chance.

34:15.299 --> 34:17.659
Sylvia, what's happened?

34:17.699 --> 34:20.420
I spoke to him.
I see.

34:20.460 --> 34:23.219
He told me about his mother's ring.

34:25.980 --> 34:29.420
You gave it to him?
You told me it was an heirloom.

34:29.460 --> 34:33.980
And if I'd told you the truth,
what good would that have done?

34:34.020 --> 34:38.299
India was... a different time,
different rules.

34:38.339 --> 34:40.460
What about Tariq's father?

34:41.980 --> 34:43.259
He didn't make it.

34:45.179 --> 34:49.219
And you still kept his wife's ring,
knowing full well...

34:49.259 --> 34:53.179
I decided to give her some hope.
You lied to her!

34:54.739 --> 34:56.460
You lied to me.

35:07.864 --> 35:10.105
How do you feel
about Betsey Grainger, Edwin?

35:11.585 --> 35:14.665
You couldn't do enough for her
the night Wyatt was killed.

35:14.705 --> 35:17.064
Are you in love with her?

35:17.105 --> 35:21.024
Betsey's a real pin-up,
every young lad's dream.

35:21.064 --> 35:23.745
Did you find out
about their relationship?

35:23.785 --> 35:26.225
Were you jealous, Edwin, is that it?

35:27.305 --> 35:28.944
What did you do, son?

35:32.105 --> 35:34.585
I just put the medal in his pocket,
that's all.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.785
You set out
to frame an innocent man.

35:36.825 --> 35:39.504
You lied about seeing Tariq Hassan
that night.

35:39.544 --> 35:42.145
Wyatt was already dead
when I got there, I swear.

35:43.305 --> 35:45.944
Oh, God, there was so much blood.

35:59.984 --> 36:01.305
What a waste.

36:01.344 --> 36:04.305
Thrown his life away
for the sake of a schoolboy crush.

36:04.344 --> 36:07.984
Oh, Edwin's not in love with Betsey.
He's in love with the idea of her.

36:08.024 --> 36:09.665
They're all as bad as each other.

36:09.705 --> 36:11.904
I mean, fantasists, the lot of them.

36:11.944 --> 36:15.384
Wyatt lived in a flipping film set,
for God's sake.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.665
Everything in his life
was a prop.

36:17.705 --> 36:19.944
Wait a minute, wait. The letter.

36:23.785 --> 36:24.904
Marcus Remington.

36:35.225 --> 36:37.344
When are you going to learn?

36:37.384 --> 36:39.984
For your information,
Betsey contacted me.

36:40.984 --> 36:43.464
I didn't mean to cause any trouble,

36:43.504 --> 36:47.064
I just want the world to know
what a good man Wyatt was.

36:47.105 --> 36:49.785
Despite the fact he lied to you,
Miss Grainger?

36:49.825 --> 36:51.745
Lied to me?
The letter...

36:52.904 --> 36:54.544
...it was a fake.

36:54.585 --> 36:56.585
What?
So was Wyatt.

36:56.625 --> 36:59.344
He wasn't a screenwriter,
he wasn't even American.

36:59.384 --> 37:00.705
But you knew that already.

37:02.185 --> 37:03.745
No.

37:03.785 --> 37:06.745
No, I loved him.
No, you didn't.

37:06.785 --> 37:08.904
It's the fame you love.

37:08.944 --> 37:11.665
Hence this little
kiss-and-tell circus.

37:11.705 --> 37:14.665
Not quite Tinseltown, but I suppose
the local rag will suffice.

37:14.705 --> 37:15.984
Oi!

37:16.984 --> 37:19.825
The agent's letter.
You found him out, didn't you?

37:21.305 --> 37:22.825
Marcus Remington.

37:22.864 --> 37:27.064
You'd worked in a typing pool,
so recognised the name.

37:27.105 --> 37:29.745
You realised
there was no Hollywood agent.

37:32.305 --> 37:34.185
Wyatt was your dream ticket,

37:34.225 --> 37:37.504
but he sold you a fantasy
and you fell for it.

37:43.785 --> 37:45.705
Argh!

37:45.745 --> 37:47.424
Argh!

37:47.464 --> 37:48.745
Argh!

37:48.785 --> 37:50.944
You confronted Wyatt
in the projection booth.

37:52.265 --> 37:54.504
Gave him the same treatment
you gave his typewriter.

37:55.864 --> 37:57.185
Do you know what he said?

37:58.265 --> 37:59.745
He said, "It didn't matter".

38:01.024 --> 38:02.944
That he'd,
"Fly me to Hollywood anyway".

38:04.185 --> 38:08.705
Pay a visit to some agents,
like some door-to-door salesman.

38:11.984 --> 38:13.585
He stood there...

38:15.145 --> 38:16.424
...beaming at me...

38:17.785 --> 38:20.745
...like it was some big adventure.

38:20.785 --> 38:22.544
You're such a goddamn drama queen.

38:25.864 --> 38:27.344
Argh!

38:29.544 --> 38:31.544
You switched the reels.

38:31.585 --> 38:33.944
It's hardly rocket science.

38:33.984 --> 38:37.544
You'd think you need a PhD,
the way Wyatt waxed on about it.

38:37.585 --> 38:40.185
He was dying on the floor
and all you could think about

38:40.225 --> 38:42.745
was buying yourself enough time
to get an alibi.

38:42.785 --> 38:45.665
Edwin must have seen you come
from the projection booth.

38:45.705 --> 38:48.984
He tried to cover it up for you,
because he thought he was in love.

38:49.024 --> 38:51.705
As if I'd give him a second glance.

38:51.745 --> 38:53.024
Pervy, little creep.

38:53.064 --> 38:57.265
Betsey Grainger, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Wyatt Rogers.

38:57.305 --> 39:00.745
That man took my dreams from me.
Oh, come on. You're no fool, Betsey,

39:00.785 --> 39:02.544
you believed him
because you wanted to.

39:02.585 --> 39:05.265
It's a cruel world we live in,
vicar.

39:05.305 --> 39:08.145
Nothing wrong with a bit
of harmless fantasy now and then.

39:09.464 --> 39:13.265
Oh, you can have that one for free.
It's Betsey with an E, by the way.

39:17.384 --> 39:19.544
Well, she's tenacious,
I'll give her that.

39:19.585 --> 39:21.265
That's the problem
with modern women,

39:21.305 --> 39:22.464
they know what they want.

39:23.665 --> 39:25.305
My first front-page scoop.

39:26.384 --> 39:28.105
Will I be in it?

39:28.145 --> 39:29.745
I'll be kind.

39:29.785 --> 39:32.825
How does "Grantchester's
most eligible vicar" sound?

39:32.864 --> 39:35.185
I'm Grantchester's only vicar.

39:35.225 --> 39:37.904
Perhaps we need to discuss
alternatives over a drink.

39:43.384 --> 39:44.665
Get off me.

39:47.105 --> 39:49.984
Hmm, it's not much
of a dressing room...

39:51.064 --> 39:52.585
...but, it'll have to do.

40:07.625 --> 40:09.344
This is your lucky day.

40:10.825 --> 40:13.384
Mr Davenport seems intent
on saving your soul.

40:13.424 --> 40:14.944
You owe this man your gratitude.

40:16.145 --> 40:18.424
Thanks.
And...

40:19.665 --> 40:21.024
...some money.

40:21.064 --> 40:23.864
But try not to steal
in front of a policeman next time.

40:25.745 --> 40:29.544
It was Inspector Keating who spoke
to the Beaumont head office.

40:29.585 --> 40:32.344
Thanks, Keatsy.
Only because you twisted my arm.

40:32.384 --> 40:35.625
I don't know what we'd do without
you, Will, honestly. We'd be lost.

40:35.665 --> 40:38.585
I don't know about that.
Come to dinner at ours tonight.

40:38.625 --> 40:40.984
She does a mean steak pie.
Sorry...

40:41.024 --> 40:45.785
Larry. I meant to say, good work.
You've just earned yourself a pint.

40:45.825 --> 40:48.544
Really?
You're buying.

40:48.585 --> 40:50.944
Night.
Night.

41:09.384 --> 41:11.825
I didn't think
this was your cup of tea, at all.

41:11.864 --> 41:14.225
Oh, there's a lot of things
you don't know about me.

41:19.625 --> 41:22.705
Kettering?
The Yank was from Kettering?

41:22.745 --> 41:25.504
The whole thing
was a total fabrication.

41:26.864 --> 41:29.785
Still, Betsey-with-an-E is right,

41:29.825 --> 41:32.904
nothing wrong with
a harmless fantasy now and then.

41:34.384 --> 41:36.585
Who said anything about harmless?

41:56.424 --> 42:01.944
♪ Just you and me
Under the pale moonlight

42:03.984 --> 42:09.024
♪ Together dancing Up all night

42:09.064 --> 42:14.864
♪ The warmth of your body
Against my heart

42:14.904 --> 42:19.705
♪ Dancing together for ever... ♪

42:19.745 --> 42:21.424
Where are we going?

43:04.504 --> 43:05.984
Don't stop.

43:09.504 --> 43:11.265
Don't stop, for God's sake.

43:22.145 --> 43:23.544
Will!

43:33.904 --> 43:36.585
Faith is the glue
that binds us to God.

43:38.424 --> 43:39.984
Faith is about trust.

43:41.384 --> 43:44.064
Beware who,
or what you put your faith in.

43:50.024 --> 43:52.665
Faith in a fantasy is destructive.

43:56.225 --> 43:59.944
Faith without question
closes our eyes to the truth.

44:02.504 --> 44:05.544
Living a lie can only end in sorrow.

44:09.984 --> 44:13.984
Being honest with ourselves
is often the most painful path.

44:16.185 --> 44:18.944
When we fail
to acknowledge the truth, we lie.

44:20.024 --> 44:21.504
And when we lie, we fall.

44:23.064 --> 44:24.705
And we take God with us.
