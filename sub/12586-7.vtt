WEBVTT

00:32.824 --> 00:34.284


00:34.367 --> 00:35.326
Bored.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.704
Bored-er.

00:37.787 --> 00:40.331
Hey, dudes, pass me your frog lungs.

00:41.666 --> 00:43.877
-

00:44.544 --> 00:46.129


00:46.796 --> 00:49.174


00:49.257 --> 00:51.301
-

00:51.384 --> 00:54.137
Aunt Peggy, I just ate a watermelon seed!

00:54.220 --> 00:57.265
Oh, my God! What if it grows in the baby?

00:57.348 --> 00:59.684
I don't want a watermelon baby!

00:59.768 --> 01:01.644
Luanne, we had this discussion.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.522
We're gonna love that baby
no matter how it comes out.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.985
So, Bobby, what's new at school?

01:09.069 --> 01:12.072
Nothing. School is so boring.

01:12.155 --> 01:16.326
We need a fire alarm
or a good class vomiting to mix things up.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.411
Too bad I'm not subbing there anymore.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.538
I was the fun teacher.

01:20.622 --> 01:24.167
Do the kids still talk about the day
I brought in microwave popcorn?

01:24.250 --> 01:25.293


01:25.376 --> 01:28.630
You guys should have a carnival
like we did in middle school.

01:28.713 --> 01:31.341
I met Nancy at the kissing booth.

01:31.424 --> 01:37.013
Even with the taste of 200 boys
on her lips, that kiss was magical.

01:37.722 --> 01:40.600
A carnival sounds great.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.228
Someone should propose that
to the student council.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.064
Hey, I'm a someone!

01:49.609 --> 01:53.071
So, unless you want me
to change my T-shirt

01:53.154 --> 01:57.575
to "Tom Landry Middle Does Not Rule,"
you will give us a carnival.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.744
What did you think?

01:59.828 --> 02:00.787
Hmm.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.623
I don't feel that you looked me
in the eye.

02:03.706 --> 02:06.126
And that makes me distrust you.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.335
I liked it.

02:07.418 --> 02:10.171
At first, I wasn't gonna give you
a carnival.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.341
Now I totally want to give you a carnival.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.426
But I don't have a carnival.

02:15.510 --> 02:16.719
Dad?

02:16.803 --> 02:20.181
The student council
is full of number crunchers.

02:20.265 --> 02:23.434
You need to show them that the carnival
will be equal parts fun

02:23.518 --> 02:25.562
and fiscal responsibility.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.729
I hear you.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.565
Less sizzle, more steak.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.942
That's right. Now, let's run it again.

02:31.025 --> 02:34.028
This time slower and with less passion.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.784
All those Baldwin boys
must be jealous of Alec.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.411
He's clearly the winner.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.370
Uncle Hank!

02:42.453 --> 02:43.371
Come quick!

02:43.454 --> 02:46.749
Mud Dauber made a Frisbee out of barbwire
and threw it to Lucky!

02:46.833 --> 02:51.004
And now his hands are all cut up
and he won't go to the hospital!

02:51.087 --> 02:53.298
Sorry. But I don't do hospitals.

02:53.381 --> 02:56.217
Everyone I know that's died
has been shot in the woods

02:56.301 --> 02:58.136
and then taken to a hospital,

02:58.219 --> 03:00.221
where they died.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.182
No hospital!

03:04.559 --> 03:06.477
Don't worry. I'll get him there.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.363
Principal Moss, there's a Terrence Pope

03:17.447 --> 03:19.991
from the superintendent's office here
to see you.

03:20.074 --> 03:22.202
I ran his school-district ID.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.286
He checks out.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.746
All right, send him in.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.625
What can I do for you, Mister Pope?

03:28.708 --> 03:31.669
It's Doctor Pope.
But I'm not hung up on formalities.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.672
According to our most recent survey,

03:34.756 --> 03:37.634
Tom Landry has reached
42 percent diversity.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.970
Diversity's good, right?

03:41.054 --> 03:44.224
Mm. All those cultures mixing together
is wonderful.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.184
Wonderful, that is, if they don't start

03:46.267 --> 03:48.061
tearing each other to shreds.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.730
What? We don't have any problems
like that here.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.107
Sure, every once in awhile
a nerd gets tossed around.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.068
But no one means nothing by it.

03:55.151 --> 03:59.405
Look, the superintendent sent me in to
perform a series of tolerance exercises

03:59.489 --> 04:01.699
to try and keep a lid on things.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.328
If you don't do it,
you'll lose your funding.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.788
Of course we'll do it!

04:08.748 --> 04:13.086
As you can see, there is absolutely
no reason not to have

04:13.169 --> 04:14.170
a carnival.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.840
I mean, there's got to be some extra money
lying around.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.175
But I don't want to touch

04:19.259 --> 04:20.260
my discretionary fund.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.428
I've built up the largest discretionary
fund in the history

04:22.512 --> 04:23.638
of the student council.

04:23.721 --> 04:24.681
And that,

04:25.014 --> 04:26.266
my friend, is my legacy!

04:27.684 --> 04:29.269
I say we put it to a vote!

04:30.520 --> 04:32.272
Who wants a carnival?

04:35.191 --> 04:36.609
Fine. Have your carnival!

04:36.693 --> 04:39.237
But it had better be great
or I will not take credit for it.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.284
Can you really do it, Bobby?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.077
I heard a rumor you got us a carnival.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.788
And that the new girl is really 22
and a cop.

04:48.871 --> 04:51.040
That's right! The carnival's on!

04:51.124 --> 04:54.544
I guess I'm gonna need a committee
to get this thing off the ground.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.004
Who's in?

04:56.087 --> 04:57.422
All right...

04:57.505 --> 04:59.173
Got here just in time.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.718
-Is it really that bad?
-Worse.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.095
I want to be in charge of bumper cars.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.597
No, dude. Bumper cars are my thing.

05:06.681 --> 05:07.807
Look at those children.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.392
A powder keg of diversity.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.060
I'll start with them.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.442
Oh.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.985
Look at my two boss men.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.611
I'm gonna make more bacon.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.948
Well, Bobby, you got your first carnival
committee meeting today.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.366
How are you feeling?

05:25.450 --> 05:26.993
Big day, big day.

05:27.076 --> 05:30.288
I decided to wear
my extra long short pants.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.249
I think they command more respect.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.250
Good call.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.045
So have you thought about
what kind of boss you're gonna be?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.213
There's different kinds?

05:39.297 --> 05:41.799
Well, sure. There's the cool boss

05:41.924 --> 05:43.801
who wants to be everybody's pal.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.595
He ends up with lots of friends,

05:45.678 --> 05:46.929
which is nice

05:47.013 --> 05:49.349
for when he gets fired
for not getting the job done.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.517
Oh, I hate working for buddy bosses.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.102
People walk all over them.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.520
And I am the worst.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.608
Then there's also the tough,
no-nonsense boss.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.610
The name pretty much says it all.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.695
Which kind do you think I should be?

06:02.779 --> 06:05.031
Well, it's kind of obvious.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.325
Gotcha.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.912
Welcome, carnival committee.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.748
You know, there's two kinds of bosses.

06:13.831 --> 06:17.293
And lucky for you,
I'm gonna be the fun kind.

06:18.586 --> 06:23.174
So if it's totally right on with everyone,
let's talk about theme.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.468
Let's talk about decorations instead.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.054
Okay, that's cool. No bad ideas.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.765
The theme informs the decorations, dude.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.811
Yeah, but decorations are way sexier.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.271
That is mad stupid.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.149
You're so inside the box.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.151
...the colors until we figure out what...

06:42.235 --> 06:43.403
Kids, listen up.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.363
This here's Doctor Terrence Pope.

06:45.446 --> 06:47.532
The district sent him to help us
get along better.

06:47.615 --> 06:50.451
I couldn't help but overhear
your little disagreement.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.955
I've got a great technique
for problem solving.

06:54.038 --> 06:54.997
Who's up for it?

06:56.332 --> 06:57.250
Perfect!

06:57.917 --> 07:00.128
Those of you who want to discuss

07:00.211 --> 07:01.796
themes, what if I said,

07:01.879 --> 07:05.174
"You could either work with the others
to find a compromise

07:05.258 --> 07:07.844
or send them on a vacation?"

07:07.927 --> 07:10.263
I say we send them on vacation.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.305
Yeah!

07:11.389 --> 07:13.641
That way they get to have a nice trip.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.436
And we can go back to working
on the carnival.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.438
Classic win-win.

07:18.521 --> 07:21.649
Well done.
You worked together to reach a decision.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.569
Sadly, it's the same decision

07:24.652 --> 07:28.531
all too many people reach
when one group disagrees with another.

07:29.699 --> 07:34.537
This "vacation" you sent these students on
goes by many names...

07:34.620 --> 07:38.249
Exile, internment, gulag, death camp.

07:38.332 --> 07:39.667
Congratulations!

07:39.750 --> 07:43.004
You've just ethnically cleansed
half your class!

07:47.675 --> 07:50.386
Lucky, I am taking
you to the hospital!

07:58.519 --> 08:01.189
Come on, Lucky.
We're doing this for your own good.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.614
What's going on? I can't get a grip.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.949
He keeps slipping away!

08:12.033 --> 08:12.950
He's like happiness!

08:15.328 --> 08:16.871
This is Vaseline!

08:18.664 --> 08:19.999
No hospital!

08:21.834 --> 08:22.668
Dangit!

08:22.752 --> 08:24.045
We'll never catch him!

08:24.128 --> 08:26.005
And he'll never rash!

08:26.088 --> 08:27.340
Genius.

08:28.090 --> 08:32.386
I didn't appreciate getting ethnically
cleansed, Connie.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.138
I didn't mean to kill you.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.182
I really thought I was sending you
on vacation.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.350
I don't get it.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.393
-Come on, everybody.
-Bobby!

08:39.477 --> 08:40.728
Why isn't anybody working?

08:40.811 --> 08:41.771
Uh...

08:41.854 --> 08:44.941
I went out on a limb for you, Hill!
You had better not screw this up!

08:45.024 --> 08:46.442
I also control the yearbook.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.445
And when you control the yearbook,
you control history.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.618
Come on, guys! Let's focus!

08:55.701 --> 08:57.286
And so it begins.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.123
Everybody pull up a chair.
I think we need some dialoguing.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.667
Now, pull up.

09:04.043 --> 09:07.880
We're gonna do a little exercise
to help you put things in perspective.

09:07.964 --> 09:11.300
Some of you will have to wear stars
on your person at all times.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.969
Oh, man!

09:14.262 --> 09:15.930
I'm a policeman?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.725
I'm getting too old for this crap.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.103
Look at me! I'm a star-bellied sneetch!

09:22.186 --> 09:24.063
No. You shouldn't be happy to have a star.

09:24.146 --> 09:28.234
A star means you've been singled out,
labeled, like the Jews in Nazi Germany.-

09:28.317 --> 09:31.696
So if we have stars, we're Jews?

09:31.779 --> 09:32.947
Exactly.

09:33.030 --> 09:36.784
-And we should be sad to be Jews?
-Yes...

09:36.867 --> 09:38.160
Well, no. It's complicated.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.245
I mean...

09:39.328 --> 09:40.705
My point is during the Holocaust,

09:40.788 --> 09:43.291
Jews weren't allowed to go to school,

09:43.374 --> 09:47.336
their property was taken away,
they had to live in prisons.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.838
I don't want to

09:48.921 --> 09:50.131
be a Jew!

09:50.214 --> 09:52.133
All right, forget the stars.
Get rid of the stars.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.092
We're moving on.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.844
New exercise.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.346
This side of the room
will be circles.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.682
And this side will be squares.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.518
Circles have absolute freedom.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.271
They can do whatever they want.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.941
But squares have no freedom, no rights,

10:09.025 --> 10:11.902
and must do whatever
the circles tell them.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.155
Begin.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.449
I said begin!

10:16.532 --> 10:17.366
Uh...

10:17.491 --> 10:21.329
Square dude, I command you
to bark like a donkey!

10:21.412 --> 10:24.373
-But donkeys don't...
-Do it, square!

10:27.918 --> 10:32.131
And you, you stupid square,
sing beautiful songs about me!

10:32.715 --> 10:34.383
Oh.

10:34.467 --> 10:41.140
<i>♪ Joseph, king of the school</i>
<i>You throw a football so far ♪</i>

10:41.223 --> 10:42.475
Yeah, yeah, I do.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.935
Okay, people!

10:45.019 --> 10:46.604
I tried being the cool boss

10:46.687 --> 10:47.688
and that didn't work.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.857
So here comes the tough boss.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.192
I'm a circle.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.861
And I order you to go back to work.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.579
That was an impressive display
of leadership.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.166
I bet you enjoyed ordering people
around like that.

11:07.249 --> 11:08.751
Well, I had to.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.087
I've got a carnival to organize.

11:11.170 --> 11:15.466
And my dad says the boss has to be tough
sometimes to get the job done.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.760
Your dad gets the job done.

11:17.843 --> 11:21.097
And his dad probably got the job done.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.641
Throughout history, "getting the job done"

11:23.724 --> 11:27.186
has meant everything
from persecution to genocide!

11:27.269 --> 11:30.523
What? My dad hasn't done
any of those things.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.901
I mean, my Grandpa Cotton
maybe a little. But...

11:33.984 --> 11:37.446
You enjoyed the power of being a boss,
of being a privileged circle

11:37.530 --> 11:39.407
that could order around a square.

11:40.324 --> 11:44.245
You see, circles and squares
are just symbols.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.580
A circle could be anything.

11:46.664 --> 11:48.833
You, circle, what is your heritage?

11:48.916 --> 11:49.917
Dutch.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.252
The Dutch.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.337
Windmills, wooden shoes...

11:53.421 --> 11:54.588
Apartheid!

11:55.798 --> 11:58.008
There are no clean hands in history.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.220
Homework, I want each of you
to research your heritage.

12:01.303 --> 12:03.389
See what you have done.

12:03.472 --> 12:05.057
You'll be able to fill a book.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.108
Mom, I'm doing some homework

12:14.191 --> 12:15.526
on my ancestors.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.195
What is our heritage? I forget.

12:18.279 --> 12:21.866
Well, let's see...
We're English and Irish.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.119
And I think your great-grandfather
was German...

12:25.202 --> 12:27.371
Stop. Just stop.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.956
Hey there, Bobby.

12:29.039 --> 12:33.169
I'd ask you how your day was,
but since you're the boss, I already know.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.045
Difficult and rewarding.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.964
Things are not good, Dad.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.717
I tried to be the cool boss,
and it didn't work.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.302
Of course it didn't.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.971
So I switched to being the tough boss.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.599
I yelled and everybody got to work.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.936
But then I was called
a horrible oppressor.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.396
Look, Bobby, you're the boss.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.733
You have to do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.654
That's what Doctor Pope said
you would say.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.411
This should be
the most exciting day of my life.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.163
But I can't be happy.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.457
The weight of my ancestors

13:11.540 --> 13:13.959
is pushing down right here!

13:14.043 --> 13:16.253
How do you think I feel?

13:16.337 --> 13:19.673
As a white man,
I've killed a little bit of everybody.

13:20.883 --> 13:24.220
That's all your stuff,
except for the goat.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.848
She fell off your truck.
But I saw her walking this way.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.225
She'll get here.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.689
Look at that snow-cone machine!

13:35.773 --> 13:39.443
First we take the Eskimos' land,
and now we're gonna eat it!

13:42.988 --> 13:45.699
Bobby, at your age, you shouldn't be
feeling this level of guilt,

13:45.783 --> 13:47.201
doubt, and self-loathing.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.622
And yet you are! I'm proud of you!

13:51.705 --> 13:54.708
-Really?
-I'm proud of all of you!

13:56.460 --> 14:00.422
Wouldn't it be great if every student felt
the same way you all do?

14:00.506 --> 14:04.927
Yeah. I wish we could tape their eyes open
and shove their faces into the truth!

14:06.554 --> 14:08.180
Wait. Why can't we?

14:08.264 --> 14:11.225
I can get through to them. Kids love me!

14:11.308 --> 14:13.686
Though they don't know
everything I'm guilty of.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.437
You've got something there, Bobby.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.857
Tomorrow, you'll have everyone
at your disposal.

14:17.940 --> 14:23.112
Instead of your carnival, we can gather
the students for an assembly of learning!

14:26.407 --> 14:28.284
The carnival is off, people!

14:28.367 --> 14:30.286
Let the healing begin!

14:37.293 --> 14:40.087
Well, tomorrow's
Bobby's big day at the carnival.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.589
I'm gonna be busy with that.

14:41.672 --> 14:45.426
So you guys are in charge of finding Lucky
and getting him to the hospital.

14:45.509 --> 14:46.594
Yup.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.012
-Yup.
-Yeah, man.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.097
Talking about ol' dang ol' hunt
is on, man.

14:50.180 --> 14:53.142
Hey, Dad. Do we have
any three-by-five cards?

14:53.225 --> 14:56.812
I'm delivering a speech tomorrow,
and I don't want to leave anything out.

14:56.896 --> 15:01.233
You know, I find that writing in all caps
puts me more at ease.

15:01.317 --> 15:04.069
-The four-by-sixes are on my desk.
-Great!

15:04.153 --> 15:06.530
Have a socially relevant day!

15:06.614 --> 15:08.073
Thanks! I will!

15:15.873 --> 15:17.499
I hope they have a tattoo...

15:19.960 --> 15:22.546
I remember when I was like them.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.757
So misguidedly happy.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.092
Oh! The superintendent just got here.

15:27.176 --> 15:31.221
If this goes well, I'll be running
programs like this all over the state.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.266
A full-time gig with health coverage
and benefits.

15:36.685 --> 15:40.022
Well, it looks as if all of Arlen
is here for the carnival.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.985
You know, we're not as handsome
a group as I thought.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.445
Oh, here comes Bobby.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.281
Make sure to buy anything as...

15:53.869 --> 15:55.371
Welcome, everyone.

15:55.454 --> 15:59.792
Before I begin, I want you to know
I will not kill you,

15:59.875 --> 16:02.878
or bring you famine, or give you smallpox.

16:06.507 --> 16:07.633
Oh, he's serious.

16:07.716 --> 16:10.427
I know you were all expecting a carnival.

16:10.511 --> 16:15.516
But millions of people were expecting
to not be genocided by our forefathers.

16:17.643 --> 16:23.065
So instead of a carnival,
we're gonna take some responsibility!

16:23.148 --> 16:25.109
What in the heck is he talking about?

16:25.192 --> 16:26.276
I'd like to take this
opportunity...

16:26.360 --> 16:28.487
-No carnival?
-How could he do this?

16:28.570 --> 16:30.698
You thought your son not popular before?

16:30.781 --> 16:33.325
Peggy Hill, get ready to be his prom date.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.410
I am anything.

16:34.493 --> 16:36.203
I can't believe Bobby did this to us.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.997
I haven't done this
since elementary school.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.916
But as God as my witness,
I swear I'm gonna bite him!

16:41.583 --> 16:44.753
-Sounds like typical schoolyard...
-My substitute sense is tingling.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.714
This crowd is about to attack.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.590
Bobby and Connie gonna get ass kicked.

16:48.674 --> 16:49.925
We need a diversion.

16:50.009 --> 16:53.721
-Tell kids Sponge Bob in front of school!
-...commit a violent act...

16:53.804 --> 16:55.639
I don't know what kids like.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.976
-What's up with that, you know?
-What are we supposed to do?

16:59.059 --> 17:01.562
First, my ancestors made...

17:01.645 --> 17:03.772
I have a different idea. Let's go.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.191
And now I'm...

17:13.907 --> 17:16.452
Okay, man, come on.
Let's go dang ol' do it, man.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.331
No hospital.

17:22.499 --> 17:26.170
Now, you can come quietly
or we'll wait until you pass out.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.008
Your call.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.052
Guilty.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.511
-Boo.
-Guilty.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.554
Boo.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.556
You're guilty of sucking.

17:37.639 --> 17:41.894
Doctor Pope, is it normal
for self-loathing to be so loud?

17:41.977 --> 17:43.896
I don't think they're getting it.

17:43.979 --> 17:46.148
Well, we picked the scab
and opened the wound.

17:46.231 --> 17:47.858
That's usually as far as I get.

17:47.941 --> 17:50.194
I'm sure they'll start reflecting
any minute now.

17:50.277 --> 17:52.237
All right, Pope.
What the hell is going on here?

17:52.321 --> 17:54.573
Oh! Superintendent, I can explain.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.408
See, Bobby Hill, right here,

17:56.492 --> 17:58.786
wanted to try and bring
the students together.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.621
How? By causing a riot?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.057
I just set up the house of mirrors.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.559
Hank Hill, you are a lucky man.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.103
Great. Let's keep it moving.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.395
Here they come!

18:30.025 --> 18:31.568
Pfft. Pfft.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.240
Dad, what are you doing?

18:36.323 --> 18:39.451
Trying to give these kids the carnival
that you promised them.

18:39.535 --> 18:44.039
I also promised to make the kids see
all the misery we're responsible for.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.292
You know, the slave trade,
potato famine...

18:47.376 --> 18:50.712
I'm supposed to be opening the wounds
so they can heal.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.047
That is ridiculous.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.050
If a wound is closed,
it's already healing.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.177
Yeah, well, I...

18:57.261 --> 18:58.720
I guess.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.347
Bobby, you're 13 years old.

19:00.430 --> 19:03.225
You didn't have anything to do
with any of that stuff.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.893
Oh, thank God!

19:04.977 --> 19:08.981
The only thing you're responsible for
is not delivering this carnival.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.191
But what about the hate, Dad?

19:11.275 --> 19:12.985
The simmering hate!

19:13.068 --> 19:16.071
If you want to learn about hate,
just look over there.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.578
-What do I do?
-Well, you're the boss.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.579
You tell me.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.167
Bobby, what should we do?
There's nobody in there.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.501
Do we keep talking?

19:29.585 --> 19:30.961
Five ticket.

19:31.628 --> 19:36.133
No! Enough talking!
The carnival's back on, everybody!

19:37.217 --> 19:39.219
But we've got a lot of work to do.

19:39.303 --> 19:41.388
Joseph, fill up the dunk tank.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.265
-With water?
-Yes.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.767
Clark, you get on the helium balloons.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.519
The rest of you come with me!

19:47.603 --> 19:50.731
We've got hot dogs to re-heat
and a goat to wrangle!

19:50.814 --> 19:51.648
Let's go!

20:00.365 --> 20:01.408
Ah.

20:17.841 --> 20:21.178
Look at all these diverse kids
working together!

20:21.261 --> 20:25.307
I don't know what the hell was going on
in there but this is great!

20:25.390 --> 20:28.143
Ah. Most exercises need some adjustments.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.811
Well, next time just do the carnival.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.063
I feel the same way.

20:31.146 --> 20:34.358
Hi. Dawn Thistle. Student council
president and carnival chairman.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.276
So what do you think? Pretty great, right?

20:36.360 --> 20:39.446
Everyone did such a fantastic job
implementing my ideas.

20:39.529 --> 20:40.864
This was your carnival?

20:41.782 --> 20:43.075
It's one of my many projects.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.284
Listen, while I have your ear,

20:44.368 --> 20:47.371
I think I'd make a great addition to the
Peers Against Pressure Teen Task Force.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.747
Let's walk and talk.

20:48.830 --> 20:51.375
It's hard to say whose idea
the carnival really was.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.460
Ideas were ping-ponging all over the room!

20:54.044 --> 20:55.921
Bobby, this is your carnival.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.547
Don't you want credit for it?

20:57.631 --> 20:59.216
I don't need credit, Dad.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.759
I'm the boss.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.886
It's all about results.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.721
It sure is.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.848
-Yup.
-Yup.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.729
-<i>Have a socially relevant day!</i>
