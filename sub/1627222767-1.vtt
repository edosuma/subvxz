WEBVTT

00:57.146 --> 00:59.248
You sure we didn't go too far?

00:59.281 --> 01:01.117
I'm seeing a lot of
nothing up ahead.

01:01.151 --> 01:02.386
Trust me,

01:02.418 --> 01:04.454
we've been coming here
since Kevin was little.

01:05.155 --> 01:06.790
We almost didn't go this year,

01:06.822 --> 01:09.992
but I guess dad wanted
to show off for you.

01:10.025 --> 01:12.328
Well, I told
him I never been up here.

01:13.530 --> 01:15.498
It's late in the season.

01:15.531 --> 01:18.501
I guess we'll have the place
more to ourselves that way.

01:18.534 --> 01:20.103
Oh, that's us.

01:20.137 --> 01:21.370
Old bear road.

01:21.403 --> 01:22.405
Now we're talking.

01:23.774 --> 01:25.876
I cannot wait to get
out on that lake.

01:26.843 --> 01:27.745
What's the point?

01:27.778 --> 01:28.938
It's too cold to swim anyway.

01:29.546 --> 01:31.481
Like you got
anything better to do,

01:31.515 --> 01:34.016
besides drinking in your dorm.

01:34.049 --> 01:37.855
Um, Kevin doesn't drink,
he plays video games.

01:37.888 --> 01:38.889
Are you kidding me?

01:39.956 --> 01:40.957
So what?

01:40.990 --> 01:42.259
No one ever got laid

01:42.292 --> 01:43.227
sitting in front of a

01:43.260 --> 01:44.337
- computer screen.
- Oh, shut up.

01:44.361 --> 01:45.829
He's just teasing.

01:45.861 --> 01:47.430
You think I'm joking?

01:47.463 --> 01:51.135
Man, you gotta be
out there making it happen.

01:51.168 --> 01:52.469
You're the salesman.

01:52.501 --> 01:54.804
As in business, so in life.

01:54.837 --> 01:56.939
You think I turn off
when I leave the office?

01:56.972 --> 02:01.879
Hell no, I'm selling, selling,
selling myself, my image,

02:01.912 --> 02:03.480
who I am and what I'm about.

02:03.513 --> 02:04.515
Sell to someone else.

02:04.548 --> 02:06.283
And I'll tell
you something else,

02:06.316 --> 02:09.186
I'm not just
sellin', I'm closing.

02:10.419 --> 02:15.191
New car, own it, plush
condo, movin' in.

02:16.425 --> 02:20.930
Lovely lady,
locked her down too.

02:23.233 --> 02:25.836
I don't think kev's
ever closed, kev?

04:40.136 --> 04:42.639
You wanna give
your mom a call, bee?

04:42.672 --> 04:44.942
You better
add her to your contacts.

04:44.975 --> 04:47.377
Come April, she's
gonna be your mom too.

04:47.410 --> 04:48.612
She's in there.

04:48.644 --> 04:50.012
Don't lie to me.

04:50.045 --> 04:51.615
Check my phone, she's in there.

04:51.648 --> 04:52.648
Hm-hm.

04:58.021 --> 04:59.423
No answer.

04:59.456 --> 05:00.456
Maybe they're out?

05:07.062 --> 05:10.099
Lay up on him this
weekend, he's trying.

05:10.766 --> 05:13.437
Everything's cool on my end.

05:13.470 --> 05:15.038
Let your parents
worry about him,

05:15.071 --> 05:18.242
I'm on vacation.

05:21.411 --> 05:23.079
Kev, come on, we're here.

05:50.173 --> 05:51.274
At least they're here.

05:55.144 --> 05:56.755
Did they say anything to
you about having car trouble?

05:56.779 --> 05:58.314
No, kev?

05:58.348 --> 05:59.650
Nobody tells me nothin'.

06:05.721 --> 06:07.089
Mom?

06:10.093 --> 06:11.427
Dad?

06:13.430 --> 06:14.430
Anybody home?

06:25.809 --> 06:27.210
When he gets out,

06:27.242 --> 06:28.521
let's go on over
to the big cabin,

06:28.545 --> 06:30.114
see if we can get our keys.

06:34.850 --> 06:36.819
Why did we even
bother coming out here?

06:36.853 --> 06:39.823
Relax, a little fresh
air never killed anybody.

06:39.855 --> 06:41.257
We've got fresh air at home.

06:41.290 --> 06:43.160
Are you two gonna
do this all weekend?

06:43.192 --> 06:44.460
It's just a couple days.

06:45.762 --> 06:46.663
What is your problem?

06:46.696 --> 06:47.872
I thought you liked coming here?

06:47.896 --> 06:50.500
Yeah, in the summer when
there are other people around.

06:50.533 --> 06:53.203
Yeah, it's the
off season, I guess.

07:03.312 --> 07:04.146
Hello!

07:04.180 --> 07:06.216
Oh, seriously?

07:07.317 --> 07:08.317
Anybody here?

07:39.214 --> 07:40.214
Well.

07:42.285 --> 07:45.588
Hello, anybody home?

07:46.456 --> 07:47.524
Mr. Maisky?

07:48.658 --> 07:49.660
This guy know you?

07:56.565 --> 07:58.101
Neighbors from next door!

08:00.569 --> 08:01.569
Hello?

08:06.543 --> 08:07.343
Stop!

08:07.377 --> 08:08.411
What, they don't care.

08:08.444 --> 08:09.746
There's food in the car.

08:12.915 --> 08:14.517
Ridiculous, four
hours outside the city

08:14.550 --> 08:16.252
and you don't know how to act.

08:16.886 --> 08:17.888
Yeah.

08:37.974 --> 08:40.944
What do you bet they're all out
on somebody's boat together?

08:40.976 --> 08:42.612
They should text, at least.

08:45.648 --> 08:47.283
There's another house
across the road,

08:47.317 --> 08:48.418
let's check with them.

09:09.339 --> 09:10.774
Yo, I see them!

09:24.120 --> 09:26.255
Hey mom, we didn't
see you inside,

09:26.288 --> 09:27.856
we were wondering
where everyone was.

09:34.264 --> 09:36.600
No.

09:52.282 --> 09:56.520
Dad, dad, no please, dad,
dad, dad come on, please,

09:58.321 --> 10:02.292
please, dad, please.

10:02.325 --> 10:04.561
Oh, no, no, please, please.

10:06.528 --> 10:08.831
I just knew y'all
were out here grilling...

10:08.865 --> 10:09.865
Freeze!

10:10.633 --> 10:11.801
Nobody fuckin' move!

10:13.568 --> 10:15.038
Dad?

10:15.071 --> 10:16.940
That's dad.

10:16.972 --> 10:18.540
Easy now, no need to hurt us.

10:18.573 --> 10:20.376
Shut up!

10:20.409 --> 10:24.346
Are you humans or
are you demons?

10:24.379 --> 10:25.381
We're on vacation.

10:26.381 --> 10:29.685
Mom, where's our mom?

10:29.719 --> 10:30.787
Where's our mom?

10:30.820 --> 10:32.355
No, no.

10:32.388 --> 10:36.326
They weren't human
anymore, the demons took 'em.

10:36.359 --> 10:38.528
We don't know nothin'
about no demons, buddy.

10:38.561 --> 10:39.629
I'm not your buddy.

10:41.798 --> 10:42.631
When'd you get here?

10:42.664 --> 10:43.866
We just got in.

10:45.033 --> 10:46.336
You just happen to stop in, huh?

10:46.369 --> 10:48.404
That's right, we,
we just drove in.

10:51.573 --> 10:52.908
Keys!

10:52.942 --> 10:53.743
What?

10:53.775 --> 10:54.844
Give me the keys!

10:59.414 --> 11:00.414
Now move!

11:01.417 --> 11:04.488
Let's go, move,
toward the house.

11:10.092 --> 11:12.995
Move, that's it,
inside, let's go.

11:15.465 --> 11:17.000
Inside, that's right.

11:18.634 --> 11:19.702
Down on the floor.

11:22.871 --> 11:27.310
All the way, arms
out, that's it, good.

11:28.811 --> 11:31.348
Now I want you to
count to a thousand,

11:31.380 --> 11:33.091
if anybody so much as
moves a finger before then,

11:33.115 --> 11:36.086
I'll blow your fuckin'
brains out, you got that?

11:36.119 --> 11:37.052
- Yes.
- Yeah.

11:37.086 --> 11:39.089
- One, two...
- Good.

11:39.121 --> 11:44.360
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

11:49.765 --> 11:54.770
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen.

11:58.408 --> 12:01.411
What do we do now?

12:02.812 --> 12:04.913
Call the cops.

12:04.947 --> 12:06.158
There's only one way outta here,

12:06.182 --> 12:07.116
they'll have a roadblock set up

12:07.149 --> 12:09.018
by the time he hits the highway.

12:09.051 --> 12:10.920
Careful, he said
he would come back.

12:10.952 --> 12:12.956
He's not comin' back.

12:14.657 --> 12:15.657
Shit, get down!

12:22.764 --> 12:24.400
All right, your cellphones.

12:24.433 --> 12:25.601
Hand 'em over.

12:30.005 --> 12:31.173
What about you?

12:31.206 --> 12:33.909
No, I left mine in my dorm.

12:33.942 --> 12:36.879
Seriously, seriously, I
don't have it, I promise you.

12:36.913 --> 12:38.447
You really wanna do this?

12:38.480 --> 12:39.448
I don't wanna have to shoot you.

12:39.481 --> 12:42.451
Well, then don't, just
leave us alone, please.

12:42.485 --> 12:43.820
How about I shoot her instead?

12:43.852 --> 12:44.953
I'll do it, you seen

12:44.988 --> 12:47.757
- the dead bodies out there.
- Take-take it, take it.

12:47.789 --> 12:49.091
Here, here.

12:49.125 --> 12:50.592
That's better.

12:51.624 --> 12:54.430
Now if you folks really
are human, I'm sorry,

12:55.465 --> 13:00.537
but I can't take any chances.
You ain't seen what I seen.

13:01.870 --> 13:03.639
Now I want you to
lock this door,

13:03.673 --> 13:05.509
and don't let anybody
in 'til sun up.

13:06.475 --> 13:07.510
I mean anybody.

13:33.101 --> 13:34.101
The fuck.

13:35.538 --> 13:38.007
Why did he keep asking
if we were humans?

13:38.039 --> 13:42.846
I don't know, because he's
a nutcase or on drugs or both?

13:42.879 --> 13:44.913
What the hell does it
matter at this point?

13:44.947 --> 13:47.716
They are dead, and... and there's
nothing we can do about it.

13:47.750 --> 13:48.851
They're dead, they're...

13:48.884 --> 13:50.261
- They're all dead, everybody's...
- Easy,

13:50.285 --> 13:51.353
easy now.

13:51.386 --> 13:54.556
We're all alive, now we're
gonna get through this,

13:54.590 --> 13:56.091
that's what counts.

13:56.125 --> 13:59.596
Maybe somebody has
a phone in the other cabins.

13:59.629 --> 14:01.465
Right, or a set of keys.

14:04.966 --> 14:06.970
It doesn't look like he's
coming back this time.

14:08.004 --> 14:09.473
We should be safe enough.

14:11.274 --> 14:14.211
Let's go then.

14:29.859 --> 14:31.594
Hello!

14:31.626 --> 14:32.528
Help!

14:32.562 --> 14:34.297
Yo guys, he might hear you!

14:34.330 --> 14:35.230
Dude seemed pretty eager

14:35.264 --> 14:37.167
to get as far away
from here as possible.

14:57.653 --> 14:58.653
Tony?

15:05.827 --> 15:06.827
Tony?

15:09.230 --> 15:10.266
Nothin' in there.

16:49.764 --> 16:51.800
Do you know how to hotwire it?

17:52.494 --> 17:53.494
Tony!

17:54.763 --> 17:55.763
Tony!

18:00.536 --> 18:02.772
I can't go in any more.

18:02.805 --> 18:05.007
There's nothing. They're
all dead, everyone.

18:07.910 --> 18:08.910
Okay.

19:52.647 --> 19:53.548
Nothing in the basement?

19:53.583 --> 19:56.019
Nothing I'm going
down there to look for.

19:57.619 --> 20:00.155
Is there a phone line anywhere?

20:00.189 --> 20:01.591
Yeah, but no phone.

20:03.925 --> 20:06.328
I just checked all
the bodies on the lake,

20:06.362 --> 20:08.064
no keys, no nothing.

20:09.664 --> 20:11.267
My guess is he took 'em.

20:13.035 --> 20:15.438
Either before or after.

20:17.906 --> 20:18.906
What are we gonna do?

20:28.450 --> 20:31.120
It's only a few
miles to the highway.

20:31.153 --> 20:33.890
Gas station maybe 10
miles back from there.

20:34.656 --> 20:35.891
Let's go.

20:37.058 --> 20:38.528
I'll move faster on my own.

20:40.028 --> 20:42.632
And leave us here,
alone with them?

20:42.664 --> 20:45.201
We shouldn't split
up now that it's dark.

20:45.233 --> 20:47.435
I can jog it. You
two will be fine,

20:47.469 --> 20:51.441
just stay here, uh, make
a fire or something.

21:06.255 --> 21:08.024
Look what I found.

21:08.824 --> 21:09.692
It could be a dead man's shoes.

21:09.724 --> 21:11.693
You don't know that.

21:11.727 --> 21:13.963
They're a little
tight, but they'll do.

21:21.103 --> 21:26.075
Stay strong
for a few more hours.

21:27.241 --> 21:28.419
If I can flag someone
down on the highway,

21:28.443 --> 21:29.803
I'll come right
back for you, okay?

21:38.086 --> 21:39.086
Be back soon.

22:10.752 --> 22:12.221
What are we supposed to do now?

22:12.253 --> 22:14.122
Just sit and wait for
Tony to ride back in?

22:15.624 --> 22:18.094
Honestly I'm surprised you
didn't offer to go instead.

22:18.126 --> 22:19.694
He's older, I'm a kid.

22:19.728 --> 22:22.597
Christ, you're nineteen.

22:22.631 --> 22:24.467
You need a babysitter?

22:24.500 --> 22:25.768
What's your problem?

22:25.800 --> 22:28.471
He wanted to go. I don't
know what's out there,

22:28.503 --> 22:30.538
this is bear country.

22:30.571 --> 22:33.208
Oh, god, if something
happens to him...

22:33.241 --> 22:34.241
He'll be okay.

22:36.045 --> 22:38.114
It's only a couple
miles to the highway,

22:38.146 --> 22:40.782
anyway, they say bears don't
usually attack humans, so...

22:40.816 --> 22:43.052
But what if he
gets to the highway

22:43.085 --> 22:43.986
and he can't get a lift?

22:44.019 --> 22:46.087
He'll be running on
the shoulder all night.

22:46.121 --> 22:48.124
Somebody will pick him up.

22:48.156 --> 22:49.125
A brother?

22:49.157 --> 22:50.658
At night, out here?

22:50.692 --> 22:52.394
More likely they'll
swerve to hit him.

22:52.428 --> 22:55.431
Well, he's a smart guy,
he won't let that happen.

22:57.432 --> 23:02.438
I just, I can't stop shaking,
I keep seeing mom and dad.

23:03.337 --> 23:04.337
Did you see them?

23:05.273 --> 23:07.376
Yeah, I saw them.

23:11.814 --> 23:14.050
If something happens to him,
I don't know what I'll do,

23:14.083 --> 23:15.083
he's all I got.

23:17.086 --> 23:18.187
He'll be okay, really.

24:35.730 --> 24:38.267
Damn it, where is he?

24:38.299 --> 24:41.236
If somebody did pick him up,
he could be on his way back.

24:41.269 --> 24:43.271
Yeah, but he might not
even be to the highway yet.

24:43.305 --> 24:44.206
Hmm.

24:44.239 --> 24:45.775
Christ, I wish I had a Xanax.

24:46.708 --> 24:47.877
Hold on.

24:47.910 --> 24:49.411
Oh, Kevin, don't leave.

24:49.443 --> 24:50.479
I'm not going anywhere.

25:00.888 --> 25:02.891
I saw these in the
fridge earlier.

25:02.924 --> 25:04.159
Nice.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.536
I thought you said
you didn't drink?

25:13.568 --> 25:14.568
You said I didn't drink.

25:19.974 --> 25:25.313
Nothing's ever
gonna be the same again.

25:27.215 --> 25:28.750
You know, I'm starting to regret

25:28.784 --> 25:30.286
not checking the
rest of those houses

25:30.318 --> 25:31.787
while it was still light.

25:31.819 --> 25:32.819
I don't.

25:34.690 --> 25:36.759
I wonder if maybe
someone left their phone,

25:36.791 --> 25:37.926
maybe...

25:38.993 --> 25:39.827
It's him!

25:39.861 --> 25:40.861
No!

25:45.334 --> 25:47.236
What do you want?

25:47.269 --> 25:49.538
What'd you do, tip them off,
let him know I was comin'?

25:49.570 --> 25:51.472
What the fuck are
you talkin' about?

25:51.506 --> 25:53.342
I'm talking
about the road, girly.

25:53.375 --> 25:54.809
The ambush.

25:54.843 --> 25:55.978
They burnt the goddamn car.

25:56.010 --> 25:58.681
No, wait, we're
humans, we can prove it to you,

25:58.713 --> 26:00.481
look, I... I've got
a pulse, feel it.

26:00.515 --> 26:01.951
I don't think so.

26:01.983 --> 26:02.817
Kevin!

26:02.852 --> 26:04.220
Against the wall!

26:04.252 --> 26:05.386
Do it!

26:05.420 --> 26:06.589
- No, no, no, no.
- Do it!

26:06.622 --> 26:08.289
Stop looking at me.

26:08.323 --> 26:10.403
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
we're... we've been drinking.

26:11.460 --> 26:14.296
Do demons drink alcohol?

26:14.328 --> 26:15.730
The hell do I know?

26:15.763 --> 26:17.332
Why would they?

26:22.371 --> 26:24.273
Give me one of those.

26:41.323 --> 26:43.292
No, no!

26:43.959 --> 26:45.294
Oh, my god... Tony!

26:47.461 --> 26:48.830
You mother... fucking...

26:48.864 --> 26:50.699
Piece of shit!

26:55.936 --> 26:58.873
Jesus, Tony, don't
kill him, do not kill him.

26:58.906 --> 27:00.275
Why not?

27:00.308 --> 27:01.743
You saw what he did
to your parents,

27:01.777 --> 27:02.944
he woulda killed you too.

27:02.978 --> 27:05.781
But... but the law, the cops
need to see how crazy he is.

27:05.814 --> 27:07.650
Otherwise, who's to
say we didn't do it?

27:07.682 --> 27:08.682
Right.

27:12.054 --> 27:13.355
Give me that shotgun.

27:14.455 --> 27:15.023
Tony?

27:15.057 --> 27:16.057
Give it to me!

27:20.328 --> 27:21.329
Up!

27:37.112 --> 27:38.314
Go on, do it!

27:38.346 --> 27:39.580
Don't.

27:39.614 --> 27:40.982
I won't unless I have to.

27:44.419 --> 27:46.355
What are we supposed
to do with him now?

27:48.089 --> 27:49.089
Kitchen.

28:01.135 --> 28:02.538
Be my guest.

28:02.570 --> 28:03.570
Fuck you!

28:04.806 --> 28:07.609
Climb down yourself or I'll
blow both of your feet off

28:07.642 --> 28:08.878
and push you down.

28:19.887 --> 28:21.624
You folks better be careful,

28:23.458 --> 28:25.561
because them things
are coming back.

28:26.862 --> 28:28.997
They're comin' back for you!

28:29.029 --> 28:30.432
They're comin' back!

28:43.444 --> 28:44.554
All right,
all right, I was wrong.

28:44.578 --> 28:45.980
Let me outta here.

28:46.013 --> 28:47.013
Come on.

28:52.421 --> 28:54.423
He's gonna be at it all night.

28:54.455 --> 28:55.156
What do you want me to do?

28:55.190 --> 28:56.392
You told me not to kill him.

28:57.858 --> 29:01.062
You don't need to do
anything, I was just sayin'.

29:02.263 --> 29:04.500
Hey, uh,
it's not what you're thinking.

29:04.532 --> 29:05.900
You guys ain't safe up there.

29:05.933 --> 29:10.605
We hear you, and we don't care.

29:10.638 --> 29:12.507
Shut the fuck up!

29:17.112 --> 29:18.480
Enough of this.

29:19.948 --> 29:20.988
Are you gonna let him out?

29:21.715 --> 29:23.418
No, I'm gonna double check

29:23.451 --> 29:25.011
there's no other way
out of that cellar.

29:41.001 --> 29:43.638
I'm not listening to
this shit all night.

30:25.279 --> 30:27.215
Why do we have to go?

30:27.249 --> 30:29.617
'Cause they're comin',
you could bet on it.

30:29.651 --> 30:31.220
Who, the police?

30:31.252 --> 30:33.821
The demons, you dumb shit.

30:33.855 --> 30:35.723
Like those dead
things out there.

30:35.757 --> 30:38.026
Those were my parents,
they were innocent people.

30:38.058 --> 30:41.896
No, they weren't, I'm no
murderer, those were demons.

30:43.131 --> 30:46.034
They look like you and
me, but they ain't,

30:46.067 --> 30:47.635
they're possessed or something.

30:49.671 --> 30:51.573
Well, how'd they get like that?

30:51.605 --> 30:53.645
I don't know, do I look
like a fucking psychologist?

30:53.674 --> 30:55.577
Psychopath, more like it.

31:01.215 --> 31:06.187
Hey, hey kid, there's
something down here with me.

31:08.123 --> 31:09.825
What is it?

31:09.857 --> 31:12.894
I don't know. I
think I saw somebody.

31:14.028 --> 31:15.797
There's something here with me.

31:15.829 --> 31:17.265
Uh, is Tony down in the cellar?

31:17.298 --> 31:19.835
No, stop talking
to that lunatic,

31:19.867 --> 31:21.503
he's just trying
to manipulate you.

31:23.872 --> 31:25.975
Uh, Tony, were you
just down in the cellar?

31:28.910 --> 31:30.612
There's nobody down there.

31:30.644 --> 31:31.779
Yes, there is.

31:31.813 --> 31:34.283
There's something here, you
gotta let me out of here now!

31:34.316 --> 31:36.018
Um, I'm sorry.

31:36.050 --> 31:37.318
It's one of them,

31:37.352 --> 31:40.122
please, get down
here, bring the gun!

31:40.154 --> 31:42.624
Please god, please help
me, it's down here,

31:42.656 --> 31:44.559
it's down here with me!

31:45.660 --> 31:48.130
Hey, stop, help!

31:52.767 --> 31:54.570
There's somebody in here!

31:54.603 --> 31:56.680
What if there's really
something down there with him?

31:56.704 --> 31:57.939
There's not, he just wants out.

31:59.941 --> 32:03.211
I hope it's a bear, and I
hope it takes its time with you!

32:03.243 --> 32:07.949
Hey, stop!

32:18.626 --> 32:19.694
Uh...

32:29.903 --> 32:31.606
Yo, asshole you down there?

32:36.944 --> 32:40.048
All right, follow me
down, but stay close.

32:40.080 --> 32:41.148
I can't see a thing.

32:41.182 --> 32:44.353
Don't, let's just close
the door, it was an act,

32:44.385 --> 32:46.221
he wants you to go down.

32:46.253 --> 32:47.221
He could be dead.

32:47.255 --> 32:49.024
I'm telling you, he's fine.

32:49.057 --> 32:50.925
He won't be when I find him.

32:50.959 --> 32:53.327
What if he doubles
back and climbs back up?

32:53.361 --> 32:57.600
Uh, here.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.769
There you go, poke him
until he goes back down.

34:12.273 --> 34:13.442
What the hell?

34:22.016 --> 34:26.221
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

34:26.253 --> 34:27.253
Tony?

34:28.856 --> 34:29.856
Kev?

34:31.525 --> 34:32.960
Are you guys all right?

34:57.885 --> 34:59.320
Is he, is he dead?

34:59.353 --> 35:01.255
I don't know.

35:27.849 --> 35:29.451
Nothin', he's dead.

35:29.483 --> 35:30.952
Who did that to him?

35:33.454 --> 35:34.789
Looks like the whole shelf

35:34.822 --> 35:36.857
just fell down on top of him.

35:36.891 --> 35:38.827
Maybe he was trying to climb up.

35:41.061 --> 35:42.163
Climb to where?

36:06.621 --> 36:07.856
Hello?

36:14.596 --> 36:15.596
Hello?

36:23.204 --> 36:24.204
I've got a knife.

36:45.460 --> 36:47.829
We're comin' up!

36:52.934 --> 36:55.036
So he was already dead?

36:55.068 --> 37:00.074
Accident, it looked like, or
suicide even, for all I know.

37:01.442 --> 37:02.452
I don't think he would've
tried to kill himself.

37:02.476 --> 37:03.577
Based on what?

37:03.610 --> 37:05.413
Your psych 101
lecture this semester?

37:05.445 --> 37:07.648
I... I just think it's
a dumb way to do it.

37:07.681 --> 37:10.417
Like I said, it probably
tipped over on him

37:10.451 --> 37:11.619
as he tried to climb up.

37:11.652 --> 37:13.288
Uh, head first?

37:13.320 --> 37:14.331
What difference does it make?

37:14.355 --> 37:15.523
He's dead, isn't he?

37:15.556 --> 37:16.490
Well, the difference
is whether or not

37:16.523 --> 37:17.659
somebody did that to him.

37:17.692 --> 37:19.094
Who?

37:19.126 --> 37:20.027
I don't know, he said there was

37:20.061 --> 37:20.629
somebody down there with him.

37:20.661 --> 37:21.962
Kev...

37:21.996 --> 37:22.931
Of course that's what he said,

37:22.963 --> 37:24.431
he was trying to sucker you.

37:24.465 --> 37:26.635
And, and then he just
tipped over a shelf and died?

37:26.668 --> 37:28.637
It was dark, he didn't
know what was happening,

37:28.670 --> 37:31.005
it... it was too heavy for him.

37:31.039 --> 37:32.149
All right, but, but he said
that there was somebody...

37:32.173 --> 37:35.476
You wanna go back downstairs
and take a second look?

37:35.510 --> 37:36.311
No.

37:36.344 --> 37:37.579
Good, neither do I.

37:53.661 --> 37:56.597
There's somebody out there.

37:56.630 --> 37:57.998
Police?

37:58.032 --> 38:01.570
I don't think
so, you see anyone?

38:02.737 --> 38:04.405
No.

38:04.438 --> 38:05.515
It's the person from the
cellar, we let them out!

38:05.539 --> 38:06.539
What?

38:08.242 --> 38:09.711
Tony, get down!

38:09.744 --> 38:10.545
Why?

38:10.577 --> 38:11.577
Maybe they have a car.

38:15.016 --> 38:16.217
I'm going outside.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.552
No, please,
just... just stay here.

38:18.585 --> 38:19.954
What's wrong?

38:19.987 --> 38:21.355
It could be a
killer or something,

38:21.389 --> 38:22.657
just... just get down.

38:24.224 --> 38:25.025
Go on!

38:25.059 --> 38:26.094
Ugh.

38:32.467 --> 38:33.635
This is stupid.

38:33.668 --> 38:35.403
It's not stupid, it's cautious.

38:35.436 --> 38:37.972
Look, whoever's outside
already knows we're in here.

38:38.005 --> 38:39.106
All the lights are on.

38:40.074 --> 38:41.074
Shit.

39:02.063 --> 39:04.967
Hello, is anybody there?

39:05.800 --> 39:07.202
Please!

39:07.235 --> 39:08.470
She's calling for help.

39:11.505 --> 39:13.541
Wait, wait, we don't
know if it's safe!

39:28.789 --> 39:30.025
Ma'am?

39:34.795 --> 39:37.331
Oh, god, oh, please don't!

39:37.364 --> 39:39.733
Please god, don't kill me!

39:39.766 --> 39:41.335
Calm down, lady, it's...

39:41.369 --> 39:44.405
Uh, we are here to help,
no one is gonna hurt you.

39:45.338 --> 39:47.342
He took my Walter.

39:47.375 --> 39:48.777
What?

39:48.809 --> 39:52.079
Uh, no, that man... that killer
is dead, we took his gun.

39:52.112 --> 39:54.215
This is Tony, he
didn't hurt anyone.

39:55.715 --> 39:58.685
How do I know you're
telling me the truth?

39:58.719 --> 40:01.056
You're just gonna
have to trust us.

40:01.088 --> 40:02.123
Look.

40:03.356 --> 40:06.161
See, there.

40:06.193 --> 40:07.633
We don't wanna hurt
you, I'm brittney

40:07.661 --> 40:09.230
a-and this is Tony and Kevin.

40:13.101 --> 40:15.804
Margie, Margie nealands.

40:15.836 --> 40:17.338
You look tired, Margie.

40:18.239 --> 40:19.574
Do you wanna come inside

40:19.606 --> 40:21.543
and we'll get you
something to eat and drink?

40:23.210 --> 40:24.779
I guess I could use some water.

40:27.648 --> 40:28.550
Be careful she doesn't go

40:28.583 --> 40:29.718
- for the gun...
- Shut up.

40:36.690 --> 40:37.759
Go for the gun?

40:38.759 --> 40:40.528
Well, if she's a demon, we...

40:59.146 --> 41:01.882
Sorry, this is all we got.

41:01.916 --> 41:03.118
Thank you.

41:05.152 --> 41:08.522
This all still feels
like some kind of nightmare.

41:10.724 --> 41:14.429
We lost family too. Can
you tell us what happened?

41:15.663 --> 41:16.663
What you saw?

41:18.231 --> 41:20.367
Only... only if you feel
comfortable talking about it.

41:21.936 --> 41:23.105
I think so.

41:24.938 --> 41:28.409
There was, uh, an
African American couple.

41:29.677 --> 41:30.677
Our parents.

41:32.246 --> 41:36.351
When the man with the gun
ran out onto the island,

41:36.384 --> 41:39.721
your father was the
one who found him.

41:39.753 --> 41:43.824
Some of the others had wanted
to run, but he wouldn't go.

41:43.858 --> 41:48.864
He was the first over the
bridge with Walter. Brave men.

41:52.699 --> 41:54.201
God rest their souls.

41:56.670 --> 42:01.475
When I heard the shots,

42:01.509 --> 42:05.146
and no one came back,

42:06.213 --> 42:07.581
I crept up and looked.

42:09.884 --> 42:12.753
We... we saw it too.

42:14.487 --> 42:19.460
The woods seemed like
the best place to run,

42:20.594 --> 42:23.797
but after a few
hours, I was so lost,

42:23.831 --> 42:27.369
I didn't know which way
to go to find the highway.

42:28.635 --> 42:30.572
My phone had no service.

42:32.739 --> 42:35.309
I'd probably still be out there

42:35.342 --> 42:37.277
if I hadn't followed the music

42:37.311 --> 42:40.282
and seen the lights
from the house.

42:44.452 --> 42:47.389
You're safe now,
that man is dead.

42:49.489 --> 42:52.259
Maybe we can get service
on your phone from here.

42:53.260 --> 42:54.260
Ours were stolen.

42:55.563 --> 43:00.568
I'm afraid I lost mine
in the dark, stupid!

43:01.034 --> 43:02.034
No.

43:02.704 --> 43:05.873
How did you
know he wasn't still here?

43:05.905 --> 43:07.307
Who?

43:07.340 --> 43:10.310
The crazy guy, how'd
you know it was safe?

43:10.344 --> 43:11.344
Kevin.

43:12.847 --> 43:15.682
If you'd spent a night alone
in those woods, young man,

43:15.715 --> 43:18.319
you wouldn't ask that question.

43:19.786 --> 43:22.389
You start to see
things in the darkness,

43:23.123 --> 43:25.359
I didn't care whether
I lived or died,

43:25.393 --> 43:29.364
I just didn't wanna
be alone anymore.

43:35.568 --> 43:37.572
Do you remember
seeing another gunman?

43:39.407 --> 43:40.742
Did he have anyone helping him?

43:41.742 --> 43:42.777
One was enough.

43:43.777 --> 43:46.480
He started while most of
us were out on the lake,

43:46.514 --> 43:49.651
by the time we got back,
all the cars were disabled,

43:49.684 --> 43:51.820
there was nowhere to go.

43:53.086 --> 43:55.590
Kevin thought there
might have been someone.

43:56.856 --> 44:00.929
No, I didn't see anyone else.

44:02.530 --> 44:04.298
There was only the one man.

44:06.733 --> 44:07.735
And now he's dead.

44:13.574 --> 44:17.711
All we need to do is sit tight
for the rest of the night,

44:17.744 --> 44:19.746
I wanna get moving as
soon as the sun comes up.

44:19.780 --> 44:21.349
Tony, not again.

44:21.382 --> 44:23.784
This time we all go
together, no one stays behind.

44:25.652 --> 44:29.590
In that case, I suppose
I should get some rest.

44:31.492 --> 44:33.361
Yeah, maybe find a comfy spot?

44:37.431 --> 44:40.501
Yeah, we should all
lay down for a bit.

44:40.534 --> 44:42.304
It's gonna be a
long walk tomorrow.

44:43.704 --> 44:45.407
Yeah, you're probably right.

45:16.137 --> 45:17.372
What are you lookin' for?

45:18.739 --> 45:21.509
I don't know, I just... it
just doesn't add up.

45:21.541 --> 45:24.010
Look, I don't know what happened

45:24.043 --> 45:25.413
down there in the cellar.

45:26.112 --> 45:29.449
It... it's not that, it's her.

45:29.483 --> 45:31.853
I mean, what was all
that shit about dad

45:31.885 --> 45:33.721
being brave and all?

45:33.753 --> 45:35.698
There's no way he went
charging across that bridge.

45:35.722 --> 45:37.962
We don't know that, you don't
know what he would've done.

45:37.992 --> 45:39.736
You remember that time
he got robbed downtown?

45:39.760 --> 45:42.764
He just... he just gave
those guys his money,

45:42.797 --> 45:45.500
they didn't even have guns
or knives or anything.

45:45.532 --> 45:46.567
So?

45:46.601 --> 45:48.436
When I asked him why
he didn't put up a fight,

45:48.469 --> 45:51.438
he was all, like, "I'd
rather be alive than a hero."

45:53.106 --> 45:55.809
Maybe he didn't think
he had a choice this time.

45:55.842 --> 45:57.545
People were counting on him.

45:57.577 --> 46:00.447
Okay, but did you
notice anything else weird?

46:00.481 --> 46:01.949
What?

46:01.981 --> 46:04.451
She didn't even ask how the
crazy guy, like the killer,

46:04.485 --> 46:06.521
how he died, uh it's
like she didn't care

46:06.554 --> 46:07.856
or she already knew.

46:09.489 --> 46:12.159
But she's probably just
exhausted and confused.

46:12.193 --> 46:14.862
I bet she's not even all the
way there after what happened.

46:14.894 --> 46:16.197
You think about that, Sherlock?

46:16.230 --> 46:17.030
Mm, no.

46:17.063 --> 46:18.175
Uh, I bet she doesn't even know

46:18.199 --> 46:19.901
half of what she's been saying.

46:21.068 --> 46:22.770
Don't turn this into
a grand jury hearing,

46:22.802 --> 46:24.438
it's just some
little old white lady

46:24.472 --> 46:26.441
who watched her
husband get blown away.

46:26.474 --> 46:28.410
I didn't think
about it that way.

46:31.144 --> 46:35.449
We know what happened,
let's just get to the police

46:35.483 --> 46:36.985
and worry about
the details later.

46:38.219 --> 46:39.554
Sure.

47:17.891 --> 47:19.259
We're waiting for you.

47:25.699 --> 47:28.570
We're waiting for you.

47:32.273 --> 47:34.776
We're waiting for you.

47:37.177 --> 47:39.847
We're waiting for you.

47:40.981 --> 47:42.817
We're waiting for you.

48:47.648 --> 48:49.851
Excuse me, young man.

48:51.719 --> 48:52.921
What are you doing up?

48:53.954 --> 48:55.690
Are you looking for something?

48:55.722 --> 48:56.923
There's a phone,

48:56.956 --> 48:57.791
you had your phone on
you this whole time.

48:57.824 --> 48:58.725
I did?

48:58.759 --> 49:00.760
Then I didn't lose it after all.

49:00.793 --> 49:01.962
What's going on?

49:01.996 --> 49:03.998
Cellphone, we
have her cellphone.

49:04.030 --> 49:06.199
I thought you said you lost it?

49:06.233 --> 49:07.201
Uh, like you said yourself,

49:07.233 --> 49:09.903
I... I was exhausted and confused.

49:09.936 --> 49:11.871
Like I said when?

49:11.905 --> 49:13.040
What?

49:13.072 --> 49:14.708
When did I say that?

49:14.742 --> 49:17.178
Kev, just give me the phone,

49:17.210 --> 49:19.021
- let me try to reach somebody.
- Just a second.

49:19.045 --> 49:21.114
Margie, were you
listening to Kevin and me?

49:21.148 --> 49:22.682
Yeah, we thought
you were asleep.

49:22.715 --> 49:24.117
I'm not on trial here.

49:26.387 --> 49:29.856
And I'd like to know
where you get the right,

49:29.889 --> 49:32.025
searching through my things.

49:32.059 --> 49:33.827
I better not have
any money missing.

49:33.860 --> 49:35.663
Are you serious?

49:35.695 --> 49:36.831
Tony, do you hear this?

49:36.864 --> 49:37.898
Ma'am,

49:37.931 --> 49:39.233
- this is unnecessary.
- Don't

49:39.266 --> 49:40.867
ma'am me.

49:40.900 --> 49:42.103
What was I supposed to think?

49:42.135 --> 49:44.704
I, I wake up to find
this little thief

49:44.737 --> 49:46.206
going through my purse.

49:46.239 --> 49:48.174
You should be thanking
him for finding the phone.

49:48.208 --> 49:50.043
Kev, just call the police.

49:50.077 --> 49:51.379
I'll call, give me the phone.

49:51.411 --> 49:55.382
Excuse me, but
I raised four kids

49:55.416 --> 49:59.621
and I am perfectly capable
of using my own phone.

50:01.454 --> 50:03.023
It is my phone.

50:09.762 --> 50:10.762
Thank you.

50:17.771 --> 50:19.840
Wouldn't you know, no service.

50:19.873 --> 50:21.418
- What, come on... this is...
- Just try calling.

50:21.442 --> 50:24.744
Whoa, whoa, cool it.
Everybody calm down.

50:24.777 --> 50:26.780
Margie, why don't you try to see

50:26.813 --> 50:29.115
if you can get service
outside? We had it earlier.

50:29.148 --> 50:30.083
But she's lying.

50:30.117 --> 50:31.285
- We're not...
- Can it.

50:31.318 --> 50:35.223
I am the victim here,
in case you forgot.

50:36.923 --> 50:38.759
I lost my Walter.

50:38.791 --> 50:40.126
We know, Margie.

50:40.159 --> 50:41.428
Now take a walk

50:41.461 --> 50:43.764
and see if you can get
through to the police.

50:43.797 --> 50:45.298
I will,

50:45.331 --> 50:48.670
and I will tell them how I
was treated by you people.

50:54.875 --> 50:56.777
Somebody should follow her.

50:56.809 --> 50:58.712
Look, you've been messed up

50:58.746 --> 51:00.715
since you saw that
body downstairs.

51:02.014 --> 51:03.014
Kevin!

51:10.224 --> 51:11.992
Hey, Margie!

51:17.530 --> 51:20.168
How did she not know
she had her phone, Tony?

51:21.168 --> 51:23.304
Something's not right with her.

51:23.336 --> 51:25.438
Well, what do
you want me to say?

51:25.472 --> 51:27.141
Do you want me to
point the gun at her

51:27.173 --> 51:28.742
and tell her give it up?

51:28.775 --> 51:31.778
Call her ass a demon like
the boy genius out there?

51:33.847 --> 51:35.516
She's scared and she's alone.

51:35.548 --> 51:37.518
Yeah, I just wish we knew.

51:37.550 --> 51:39.753
We know enough
to get out of this.

51:39.786 --> 51:40.821
Not me.

51:42.155 --> 51:45.759
Help, help me!

51:45.793 --> 51:46.494
What are you doing?

51:46.527 --> 51:47.927
We're trying to get out of here!

51:47.960 --> 51:48.928
Why did you do that?

51:48.961 --> 51:50.164
What are you doing?

51:50.197 --> 51:51.307
- He tried to kill me!
- She smashed the phone!

51:51.331 --> 51:53.867
Look, I was right!

51:53.900 --> 51:54.501
Tony!

51:54.534 --> 51:55.335
Mof.

51:55.369 --> 51:57.037
- Stop!
- He's out of his damn mind!

51:57.070 --> 51:58.506
She was supposed
to call for help!

51:58.539 --> 52:01.108
I did, the police said
they'll be here any minute!

52:01.141 --> 52:03.077
Yeah, don't bet on it!

52:03.110 --> 52:05.512
And when they get here,
they'll hear an earful from me!

52:05.545 --> 52:07.013
Yeah, you're a lying bitch!

52:08.014 --> 52:09.817
Tony! Stop hurting him!

52:09.849 --> 52:10.927
Are you listening to this kid?

52:10.951 --> 52:12.219
He's fuckin' nuts!

52:12.251 --> 52:13.463
He doesn't know
what he's saying.

52:13.487 --> 52:14.288
Kevin, shut up!

52:14.320 --> 52:15.889
I'm telling the truth!

52:15.922 --> 52:18.024
I'm going inside to wait.

52:18.057 --> 52:21.228
You can tell him if he
comes in and apologize

52:21.260 --> 52:22.829
like a civilized person,

52:22.862 --> 52:24.998
I'll think about not
pressing charges.

52:39.913 --> 52:40.847
Are you okay?

52:40.880 --> 52:41.882
That motherfucker.

52:43.884 --> 52:44.552
Why did you do that?

52:44.585 --> 52:45.985
She smashed the phone!

52:46.018 --> 52:47.221
Why would she do that?

52:49.523 --> 52:50.532
Come on, let me help you up.

52:50.556 --> 52:51.958
Leave me alone.

52:52.925 --> 52:53.927
Kevin.

52:53.960 --> 52:54.960
Just go!

53:41.240 --> 53:44.144
It's okay, I'm
sorry you had to go.

53:45.012 --> 53:45.613
How is he?

53:45.646 --> 53:47.248
What do you care?

53:49.416 --> 53:52.987
I'm sorry, bee, but
he was asking for it.

53:53.019 --> 53:54.621
To get punched in the face?

53:54.655 --> 53:55.590
He's a kid for gods sakes.

53:55.623 --> 53:58.925
He's no kid... anyway,
he was gunning for her.

53:58.958 --> 53:59.893
He was out of his mind.

53:59.927 --> 54:01.128
Yeah, he smashed my phone

54:01.161 --> 54:02.896
and then he came at me
like a crazy person.

54:02.929 --> 54:04.130
He smashed the phone?

54:04.164 --> 54:05.675
Yeah, and he might
have done worse to me

54:05.699 --> 54:07.967
if... if you two hadn't
come out there.

54:08.001 --> 54:11.939
Well, if everyone had gone
to sleep like I told you to,

54:11.972 --> 54:12.673
this never would've happened.

54:12.706 --> 54:14.341
If we would've been asleep,

54:14.373 --> 54:15.617
we would've never
found the phone

54:15.641 --> 54:17.320
and the cops wouldn't
be on their way here.

54:17.344 --> 54:18.979
Well, until they get here,

54:19.012 --> 54:21.181
your brother better
cool his ass down

54:21.213 --> 54:23.483
or I'll give him another
black eye to cry about.

54:23.516 --> 54:27.620
No need for any of that once
he cools his boots outside.

54:27.653 --> 54:29.056
You are not the law here,

54:29.088 --> 54:30.924
you're just an
asshole with a gun.

54:30.958 --> 54:32.159
For now, that's good enough.

54:32.192 --> 54:33.594
Oh, spare us.

54:33.626 --> 54:35.929
You never miss an
opportunity to give orders.

54:35.963 --> 54:37.439
This must be a dream
come true for you.

54:37.463 --> 54:38.364
Shut it.

54:38.398 --> 54:39.934
Or what, you're gonna slug me?

54:41.434 --> 54:43.237
Usually you just throw
your money around,

54:43.269 --> 54:46.005
but I guess waving a gun
around works even better.

54:46.039 --> 54:47.207
I throw money around?

54:47.239 --> 54:48.074
- Yeah.
- Are you hearing yourself

54:48.108 --> 54:49.310
right now?

54:49.342 --> 54:51.210
Easy now, it's just
talk, she's cracked.

54:51.244 --> 54:52.254
This has all been
too much for her.

54:52.278 --> 54:53.380
You know what?

54:53.413 --> 54:55.014
No one here is
cracked but you, lady.

54:55.047 --> 54:57.583
Maybe keep your mouth shut
until the cops get here.

54:58.684 --> 55:00.019
Margie?

55:00.052 --> 55:01.087
Kevin.

55:03.556 --> 55:05.025
Ma'am, I'm real sorry.

55:06.193 --> 55:07.736
I.. I don't know what
happened out there,

55:07.760 --> 55:09.563
maybe all this just
got to my head.

55:13.266 --> 55:16.369
I'm sorry too, young man.

55:16.402 --> 55:19.706
I-I-I should've just
given you the phone.

55:19.739 --> 55:21.442
Ah, that, that's on me.

55:21.474 --> 55:25.545
I, I lost my head there for
a minute, again, I'm sorry.

55:26.713 --> 55:29.983
Maybe we all got a little
out of hand, kev. Even me.

55:31.318 --> 55:33.554
Uh, don't blame yourself,
I was asking for it.

55:34.688 --> 55:35.756
Kevin?

55:35.789 --> 55:40.995
Oh, seriously, and poor
Margie here's no demon,

55:41.027 --> 55:43.063
she lost somebody
just like we did.

55:43.864 --> 55:46.099
What was his name,
uh, Henry, was it?

55:47.000 --> 55:51.972
Walter, my husband's
name was Walter.

55:53.039 --> 55:54.074
Are you sure about that?

55:54.108 --> 55:57.144
Are you sure it wasn't
Henry or maybe even Andrew?

55:58.644 --> 56:01.514
I think I'd know
my husband's name.

56:01.547 --> 56:02.682
Well, think very carefully.

56:02.715 --> 56:05.752
Are you absolutely certain
your husband's name was Walter?

56:05.786 --> 56:10.992
She already said his name
was Walter, Kevin, give it up.

56:12.159 --> 56:16.197
You people are something else!

56:18.065 --> 56:19.666
No, I'm just checking

56:19.699 --> 56:22.059
because there weren't any Walters
lying dead on that island.

56:24.271 --> 56:28.375
I got a Henry, a Clayton and
an Andrew, but no Walters,

56:28.407 --> 56:29.777
not even for a middle name.

56:31.177 --> 56:32.687
Those were the only
men on that island...

56:32.711 --> 56:34.347
Besides our dad, of course.

56:36.449 --> 56:38.218
Good god.

56:39.286 --> 56:40.653
Margie, what the fuck?

56:41.521 --> 56:43.057
Oh, good lord above.

56:43.090 --> 56:45.526
Maybe he's still alive,
if he's not out there,

56:45.559 --> 56:46.360
maybe he made it.

56:46.393 --> 56:47.594
He could be hurt.

56:47.626 --> 56:50.030
We didn't see any
survivors all day.

56:51.530 --> 56:56.237
Well, if nobody else
cares, I'm going to look.

57:01.108 --> 57:02.509
What are you doing?

57:02.541 --> 57:03.744
Kevin?

57:03.777 --> 57:05.612
Put that fuckin'
knife down, boy.

57:05.644 --> 57:08.615
Just as soon as she
answers my last question.

57:10.382 --> 57:11.851
Where are you from, Margie?

57:11.885 --> 57:15.189
Those are my things,
you have no right.

57:15.222 --> 57:17.324
Put it down, kev,
put the knife down.

57:17.356 --> 57:19.092
Only when she's
answered my question.

57:19.126 --> 57:20.394
Where are you from, Margie?

57:20.427 --> 57:22.829
Give me back my property!

57:22.862 --> 57:25.565
Look, I'll even give
you three guesses,

57:25.599 --> 57:28.168
city and state, Margie,
uh, here, here's a hint,

57:28.201 --> 57:30.137
it's in the continental
United States.

57:30.170 --> 57:32.606
Give me back my property!

57:32.639 --> 57:36.175
Oh, I will, but first Margie
old gal, where are you from?

57:36.208 --> 57:38.244
Give me back my property!

57:38.277 --> 57:39.480
Just answer him!

58:01.902 --> 58:03.137
Tony?

58:05.505 --> 58:09.309
It... it just fired.

58:13.547 --> 58:16.483
Kev, you saw, I... I didn't
even pull the trigger.

58:17.884 --> 58:20.121
I didn't see nothing,
I was looking at her.

58:20.920 --> 58:22.222
Oh, my god.

58:25.291 --> 58:27.228
You... you... you killed her.

58:28.695 --> 58:30.206
You were the one waving
the fucking knife around.

58:30.230 --> 58:31.398
I didn't use it!

58:31.431 --> 58:33.300
Why was it even here?

58:33.333 --> 58:34.843
I don't know,
I... how was I supposed to know

58:34.867 --> 58:36.536
she was gonna go for the gun?

58:38.204 --> 58:42.476
Oh my god, it was like she
had a seizure or something.

58:42.509 --> 58:43.510
Oh, that was no seizure.

58:43.543 --> 58:44.945
How do you know?

58:44.978 --> 58:47.380
Because she was a demon,
she was lying to us.

58:47.414 --> 58:49.450
No, Kevin, she's dead.

58:50.750 --> 58:53.253
Tony, she was gonna
use that gun, I saw her.

58:56.956 --> 58:59.826
God, that thing just
went off on its own.

59:22.349 --> 59:24.985
Do you think
they'll arrest Tony?

59:25.018 --> 59:26.519
I don't know.

59:27.853 --> 59:29.622
They wouldn't, would they?

59:29.655 --> 59:31.557
I mean, after all the
stuff that's happened,

59:31.590 --> 59:33.960
they'll know it was
an accident, right?

59:33.994 --> 59:36.463
What makes you
think they'll care?

59:36.496 --> 59:39.333
Well, there
could be more like her.

59:39.365 --> 59:40.266
Kev, would you let up with that?

59:40.300 --> 59:42.436
I don't know what was
wrong with that lady,

59:42.469 --> 59:44.672
but it doesn't matter now.

59:46.405 --> 59:47.875
Take a look at the license.

59:52.512 --> 59:53.647
Wisconsin?

59:55.282 --> 59:57.293
I honestly don't know why she
didn't just say that, but...

59:57.317 --> 59:58.585
Look at the name.

1:00:03.389 --> 1:00:04.391
It's not the same.

1:00:04.423 --> 1:00:05.423
I see it.

1:00:13.565 --> 1:00:16.971
Mom, dad and all
those people are dead,

1:00:19.505 --> 1:00:23.943
and the only person who
survived was lying to us.

1:00:23.976 --> 1:00:26.413
The whole time, she
was lying to us.

1:00:26.445 --> 1:00:28.681
This is what I've been saying.

1:00:28.715 --> 1:00:33.320
I think, I think Carol McCarthy
ran off into the woods,

1:00:33.353 --> 1:00:36.356
but someone else, or
something else, came out.

1:00:38.458 --> 1:00:43.297
And if that's true, and there
is something in the woods,

1:00:43.329 --> 1:00:46.299
then who else was out there?

1:01:16.963 --> 1:01:20.334
You got this, tone,
this is all you.

1:01:27.407 --> 1:01:29.009
No.

1:01:29.041 --> 1:01:30.443
Otherwise, Tony would be...

1:01:31.945 --> 1:01:33.080
What about Tony?

1:01:36.148 --> 1:01:37.550
How you holding up, baby?

1:01:38.985 --> 1:01:42.122
Terrible, after
what happened today?

1:01:42.155 --> 1:01:45.592
It was an accident,
she came at you.

1:01:46.992 --> 1:01:50.029
It was an accident,
but it was also my fault.

1:01:52.398 --> 1:01:54.008
And now I'm gonna relive
that moment every day

1:01:54.032 --> 1:01:55.501
for the rest of my life.

1:01:58.938 --> 1:02:02.376
I owe you an apology... I
owe you both an apology.

1:02:03.143 --> 1:02:07.047
Tonight, these last few
hours... this isn't me,

1:02:07.079 --> 1:02:11.418
this is not who I am. Things
just got out of hand so fast.

1:02:12.885 --> 1:02:14.463
I think we're all out of
our heads at this point.

1:02:14.487 --> 1:02:16.956
Let's just sit tight and wait.

1:02:18.458 --> 1:02:21.128
Right, for the police.

1:02:21.161 --> 1:02:24.164
I don't even think
she called the police.

1:02:24.197 --> 1:02:25.798
I think you're right.

1:02:26.733 --> 1:02:27.733
You do?

1:02:29.001 --> 1:02:32.873
Yeah, at the very least,
she was pretty unstable.

1:02:32.905 --> 1:02:35.074
Hard to know exactly
what was going on there.

1:02:36.476 --> 1:02:38.445
Yeah, we... we
know what you mean.

1:02:44.650 --> 1:02:46.652
Come on, let's take a walk.

1:02:47.586 --> 1:02:49.121
Outside?

1:02:49.155 --> 1:02:50.690
Yeah, outside.

1:02:50.722 --> 1:02:52.726
Let's do what we
shoulda did yesterday,

1:02:52.759 --> 1:02:55.528
get the hell out
of here, together.

1:02:55.561 --> 1:02:57.596
I'm not walking through
the woods in the dark.

1:02:57.630 --> 1:02:59.465
Nothing to be scared of,

1:02:59.498 --> 1:03:02.468
we'll stick by the
road the entire time.

1:03:02.501 --> 1:03:05.538
I think we should stay here
and wait until it's light.

1:03:06.606 --> 1:03:10.444
It'll be dawn before we
hit the highway! Come on!

1:03:14.646 --> 1:03:17.150
You're gonna make me
go out there alone?

1:03:17.182 --> 1:03:18.717
If five-o does show up,

1:03:18.751 --> 1:03:21.155
I don't want them to find
me out there by myself.

1:03:25.557 --> 1:03:26.626
What could it hurt?

1:03:28.494 --> 1:03:30.096
But we stay on the road.

1:03:31.264 --> 1:03:34.134
I'm not going
anywhere, it's not safe.

1:03:34.166 --> 1:03:36.536
It'll be safe if the
three of us go together.

1:03:38.505 --> 1:03:39.640
Kevin, please?

1:03:41.608 --> 1:03:43.577
Fine.

1:03:43.610 --> 1:03:45.945
Good. They'll be waiting for us.

1:03:47.547 --> 1:03:48.547
What?

1:03:49.215 --> 1:03:50.083
Huh?

1:03:50.115 --> 1:03:51.518
What did you just say?

1:03:52.619 --> 1:03:55.822
Let's hope they're waiting
for us. The police, I mean.

1:03:55.855 --> 1:03:57.757
You said, they'll
be waiting for us.

1:04:00.793 --> 1:04:01.793
Did I?

1:04:03.195 --> 1:04:05.598
My mouth has a mind
of its own sometimes.

1:04:05.632 --> 1:04:07.067
Come on, kev.

1:04:12.804 --> 1:04:13.606
No!

1:04:13.639 --> 1:04:14.639
Kevin!

1:04:20.547 --> 1:04:22.014
Guys, stop!

1:04:22.047 --> 1:04:23.250
No man, drop it!

1:04:35.594 --> 1:04:36.629
Baby, I...

1:04:38.030 --> 1:04:39.099
Brittney, wait!

1:04:44.170 --> 1:04:45.170
Come back!

1:04:59.284 --> 1:05:00.284
Brittney!

1:05:02.688 --> 1:05:03.688
Come back!

1:05:23.643 --> 1:05:24.643
Brittney!

1:05:25.177 --> 1:05:26.712
Come on, please!

1:06:01.847 --> 1:06:03.784
Bee, come on!

1:06:26.438 --> 1:06:29.009
Easy, easy.

1:06:29.041 --> 1:06:30.242
Get off of me!

1:06:30.275 --> 1:06:32.244
- Somebody help, help...
- Shut up! Shut up!

1:06:32.277 --> 1:06:35.114
I'm not gonna hurt you, but
you gotta shut the fuck up.

1:06:35.148 --> 1:06:36.148
Can you do that?

1:06:37.416 --> 1:06:38.851
You were dead.

1:06:38.885 --> 1:06:40.387
Not quite.

1:06:40.420 --> 1:06:42.398
Well, how did you get out
from under those shelves?

1:06:42.422 --> 1:06:43.889
It wasn't me, ya dumb shit.

1:06:43.922 --> 1:06:46.291
It was one of them
prick demon things.

1:06:46.324 --> 1:06:47.359
For real?

1:06:47.393 --> 1:06:48.927
Why do
you think I'm standing here

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:50.396
in my drawers
freezing my ass off?

1:06:51.697 --> 1:06:54.100
I gotta sit down.

1:06:56.735 --> 1:06:59.739
You were right,
you were telling the truth the whole time.

1:07:01.206 --> 1:07:02.785
I tried to tell you, but
nobody would listen to me.

1:07:02.809 --> 1:07:04.210
Hey fuck you, you
killed my parents,

1:07:04.242 --> 1:07:06.746
what the fuck were
we supposed to think?

1:07:06.778 --> 1:07:08.213
I thought you were possessed.

1:07:08.246 --> 1:07:09.414
No, you didn't.

1:07:09.447 --> 1:07:14.687
Maybe you're right,
I made a mistake, I'm sorry.

1:07:15.454 --> 1:07:17.223
If I'd a taken you with me,

1:07:18.423 --> 1:07:20.693
well, maybe we'd a got
out of this, but now,

1:07:20.726 --> 1:07:21.994
it's, it's on me.

1:07:24.797 --> 1:07:25.797
What about you?

1:07:27.032 --> 1:07:28.735
What do you mean, what about me?

1:07:29.936 --> 1:07:31.771
Ain't you gonna
say you're sorry?

1:07:31.804 --> 1:07:32.804
No.

1:07:33.806 --> 1:07:34.806
Oh.

1:07:35.942 --> 1:07:36.942
Brittney!

1:08:03.402 --> 1:08:06.271
I can't see either
of them, it's too dark.

1:08:06.304 --> 1:08:09.041
He's only got one shell left.

1:08:09.074 --> 1:08:10.476
Are you sure?

1:08:10.510 --> 1:08:12.445
It's my gun, I loaded it.

1:08:12.478 --> 1:08:14.813
Who the hell are you, anyway?

1:08:14.847 --> 1:08:17.182
Plumber, came here
to fix the shitter.

1:08:17.216 --> 1:08:18.518
With a shotgun?

1:08:18.551 --> 1:08:20.320
This is bear country, kid.

1:08:33.099 --> 1:08:34.768
Bee, come on!

1:08:42.073 --> 1:08:44.042
You might as well relax, kid.

1:08:44.076 --> 1:08:47.247
Sit back and wait for
that last shotgun blast.

1:08:47.279 --> 1:08:48.914
Brittney's out there.

1:08:48.948 --> 1:08:52.418
I just can't sit around and
wait here while he hunts her.

1:08:52.451 --> 1:08:53.353
From what I seen,

1:08:53.386 --> 1:08:54.855
she can take care of herself.

1:08:55.622 --> 1:08:57.858
That's my sister,
she's all I got left.

1:08:59.292 --> 1:09:01.928
What do you think you're
gonna do out there, anyway?

1:09:35.595 --> 1:09:36.863
Oh, fuck you.

1:09:37.863 --> 1:09:39.365
Wait, kid, wait!

1:10:12.597 --> 1:10:14.199
I don't know
what you are, but...

1:10:14.233 --> 1:10:16.336
What do you mean, what I am?

1:10:17.536 --> 1:10:19.372
You killed Kevin, I saw it.

1:10:19.404 --> 1:10:21.875
Baby, you don't even
know what you saw.

1:10:21.908 --> 1:10:23.509
You sound about as fucked up

1:10:23.542 --> 1:10:25.945
as your crazy ass
brother right now.

1:10:25.978 --> 1:10:27.313
Go inside, I'll show you.

1:10:27.345 --> 1:10:28.547
No.

1:10:28.581 --> 1:10:29.481
No?

1:10:29.515 --> 1:10:30.851
I'm not going inside with you.

1:10:32.318 --> 1:10:34.554
So you're just gonna stand
out here all fucking night?

1:10:34.587 --> 1:10:35.587
Is that it?

1:10:38.356 --> 1:10:40.025
Answer one question for me.

1:10:42.261 --> 1:10:43.864
When are we getting married?

1:10:44.831 --> 1:10:47.100
Are you serious
with this shit bee?

1:10:47.132 --> 1:10:48.277
I can't remember the goddamn...

1:10:48.301 --> 1:10:49.636
What month?

1:10:49.668 --> 1:10:51.904
What month are we
getting married Tony?

1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:57.176
Ain't nobody getting married.

1:11:00.145 --> 1:11:01.447
Tony!

1:11:01.479 --> 1:11:02.514
Kevin?

1:11:02.547 --> 1:11:03.949
Boy, you better back the...

1:11:10.389 --> 1:11:12.292
Mother... fff...

1:11:24.369 --> 1:11:25.305
Kevin.

1:11:25.337 --> 1:11:26.005
- Are you okay?
- I killed Tony!

1:11:26.037 --> 1:11:27.306
I killed Tony.

1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:28.307
Kevin, are you okay?

1:11:28.341 --> 1:11:29.576
I don't know.

1:11:31.609 --> 1:11:32.609
Are you okay?

1:12:15.720 --> 1:12:18.357
Hmm?

1:12:22.795 --> 1:12:26.699
Ah, shit!

1:12:28.701 --> 1:12:31.037
Now what do we do?

1:12:31.069 --> 1:12:32.070
Start walking.

1:12:32.104 --> 1:12:33.773
We ain't walking.

1:12:33.805 --> 1:12:35.640
Who said anything about we?

1:12:35.673 --> 1:12:37.743
What do you think, they're
just gonna let you two

1:12:37.777 --> 1:12:38.821
stroll your asses out of here?

1:12:38.845 --> 1:12:40.488
You don't even know
what you're talking about.

1:12:40.512 --> 1:12:42.081
Oh yeah?

1:12:42.113 --> 1:12:43.258
Yeah, you should've seen
what they done to me.

1:12:43.282 --> 1:12:44.684
- No one cares - guys, guys...

1:12:44.716 --> 1:12:45.827
- What happened to you...
- Guys!

1:12:45.851 --> 1:12:50.055
We're not walking out of
here. I've got a better idea.

1:15:40.492 --> 1:15:42.360
Looks safe enough, right?

1:15:42.394 --> 1:15:45.565
Uh, be careful, could be
some of them demons around.

1:15:45.597 --> 1:15:47.300
How do we know
you're not a demon?

1:15:47.332 --> 1:15:48.433
Ever think about that?

1:15:50.769 --> 1:15:51.769
Hey, look!

1:15:53.338 --> 1:15:55.474
Hey, do, do you
guys have a phone?

1:15:55.506 --> 1:15:56.841
We need the police.

1:15:56.875 --> 1:15:58.411
Or an ambulance.

1:16:05.251 --> 1:16:06.286
Come on.

1:16:07.119 --> 1:16:11.256
Uh I'm... i'm
not going up there.

1:16:11.289 --> 1:16:12.289
Then stay.

1:16:15.027 --> 1:16:16.195
Oh, shit!

1:16:24.502 --> 1:16:25.502
Drop it!

1:16:47.893 --> 1:16:51.331
We've been waiting for you.

1:16:53.832 --> 1:16:54.832
You?

1:16:58.470 --> 1:16:59.470
Walter?

1:17:06.679 --> 1:17:08.413
Shit.

1:17:14.319 --> 1:17:15.319
What are you?
