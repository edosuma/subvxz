00:32.920 --> 00:35.600
So let's go. Don't
leave us hanging.

00:35.600 --> 00:36.960
Come on!

00:36.960 --> 00:39.160
I wanna know
what happened!

00:40.520 --> 00:42.000
I think we got 'em.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.760
So who's the guy that
brought the chest to Sardo?

00:44.760 --> 00:46.960
Yeah. And where was
the cemetery?

00:46.960 --> 00:49.840
And how come only Rush
could open the chest?

00:49.840 --> 00:51.960
Let's have
a little recap here

00:51.960 --> 00:53.960
to get you
back up to speed.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.480
OK. Rush and Max
were brothers

00:56.480 --> 00:58.480
who didn't really
get along.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.480
All rich wanted to do
was grow up,

01:00.480 --> 01:02.440
but Max was always
keeping him down.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.560
Rush and Max had different
ideas of what fun was.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.320
Rather than pound
Max in the dirt,

01:07.320 --> 01:10.160
Rush bought him a magic
set to keep him busy

01:10.160 --> 01:11.680
and far away.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.200
But there was an odd treasure
chest at the magic mansion

01:15.200 --> 01:17.640
that no one could open
except Rush.

01:17.640 --> 01:18.920
Inside
was a strange spyglass

01:18.920 --> 01:20.800
that showed Rush images
of a spooky cemetery

01:20.800 --> 01:22.920
and played tricks
on Max.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.400
The spyglass was haunted,

01:25.400 --> 01:27.600
and it lured some
horrifying ghosts.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.960
One of the ghosts
kidnapped poor Max,

01:29.960 --> 01:31.560
and only Rush knew.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.560
Rush didn't know what
to do. Max was gone,

01:33.560 --> 01:35.240
and he couldn't
contact his parents.

01:35.240 --> 01:36.840
That's where
we left off.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.840
Kick it.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.320
Submitted
for the approval

01:40.320 --> 01:41.920
of the Midnight
Society,

01:41.920 --> 01:43.840
we call
this story...

01:52.000 --> 01:53.920
Mr. Sardo?

01:53.920 --> 01:56.600
Mr. Sardo,
you in there?

01:56.600 --> 01:57.760
[Knocking]

01:57.760 --> 01:59.440
Sardo. Sardo!

01:59.440 --> 02:01.040
Oh, this is hopeless.

02:01.040 --> 02:04.360
Go away!
We're closed until--

02:04.360 --> 02:05.680
You!

02:07.600 --> 02:09.520
I knew you'd be back!

02:09.520 --> 02:12.000
Look, buddy, I don't
know what this thing is,

02:12.000 --> 02:14.880
but it's making ghosts
show up in my house.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.880
Ghosts? Yes, well, they're
probably just illusions.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.360
Yeah? Then 2 illusions

02:19.360 --> 02:21.360
just snatched
my little brother.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.880
Either you tell me
what's goin' on,

02:23.880 --> 02:25.880
or I'm coming back
with the cops.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.720
I'm not so sure
the police would believe you

02:28.720 --> 02:30.240
any more than I do.

02:34.440 --> 02:37.320
They don't.
I've already tried.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.680
Look, Mr. Sar--

02:40.680 --> 02:42.560
I mean Sardo.

02:42.560 --> 02:45.280
All I want is
my brother back.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.280
I'm afraid
I don't know

02:47.280 --> 02:48.760
much more than you.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.360
But there's someone
who does.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.520
"The Wild Boar
Coiffure"?

02:55.960 --> 02:57.360
A barber shop?

02:57.360 --> 03:00.360
It's run by the same man
who gave me the chest.

03:00.360 --> 03:03.840
I suggest you go
and talk to him.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.320
Excuse me.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.320
I'm looking for
the guy who--

03:41.320 --> 03:42.440
You found him.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.840
Vink's the name.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.560
Dr. Vink.

03:49.560 --> 03:51.480
Dr. Vink?

03:51.480 --> 03:54.200
Precisely!

03:55.880 --> 03:57.760
I've been waiting
for you.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.000
You have?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.760
What do you think of
my latest endeavor?

04:01.760 --> 04:05.280
Of course, patrons are
less interested in coiffure

04:05.280 --> 04:09.000
than they are in my
unique hair tonics.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.280
They have such
interesting properties.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.280
[Sniffs]

04:15.280 --> 04:16.360
Shall I...

04:16.360 --> 04:19.279
Massage a few drops
into your scalp?

04:19.279 --> 04:20.760
Uh... no, thanks.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.120
Of course not.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.120
We have work to do.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.600
Look, my little
brother's in trouble--

04:27.600 --> 04:29.760
I know all about
your brother,

04:29.760 --> 04:32.280
and I can help you
find him

04:32.280 --> 04:35.720
as long as you
understand one thing.

04:35.720 --> 04:37.280
What's that?

04:37.280 --> 04:39.000
<i>I am not a nut bag!</i>

04:41.360 --> 04:44.160
How do you know about--

04:44.160 --> 04:45.160
Jonas Cutter.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.320
What?

04:46.320 --> 04:48.640
Captain Jonas Cutter,
he called himself.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.760
A murderous
galley slave.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.760
Who led the bloodiest
mutiny in maritime history.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.800
They say he took
the name Cutter

04:57.800 --> 05:00.720
because of his love
for the blade

05:00.720 --> 05:03.920
and what it could do
to flesh.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.920
History says he concealed
an immense treasure

05:06.920 --> 05:09.920
in a secret vault
that, to this day,

05:09.920 --> 05:11.720
has never been found.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.720
Why are you
telling me this?

05:13.720 --> 05:15.760
Because I do believe

05:15.760 --> 05:18.080
I've tracked
the beggar down.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.600
That's the guy!

05:19.600 --> 05:21.600
We gotta tell
the cops!

05:21.600 --> 05:24.280
The police
can't help you, lad.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.800
W-why not?

05:27.800 --> 05:31.840
Because Jonas Cutter has
been dead for 200 years.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.280
I don't believe this.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.720
This chest belonged
to the one man

05:42.720 --> 05:44.240
who tried to defeat
Cutter,

05:44.240 --> 05:46.720
but instead met with
a grisly death.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.400
That's from
the Magic Mansion!

05:48.400 --> 05:50.160
I left it there
myself,

05:50.160 --> 05:52.240
hoping to find
the champion.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.560
Who?

05:53.560 --> 05:55.080
Before he died,

05:55.080 --> 05:58.240
this brave soul
vowed that one day

05:58.240 --> 06:00.560
a champion would come

06:00.560 --> 06:04.520
to avenge the deaths
of all of Cutter's victims.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.160
These tools...

06:06.160 --> 06:10.160
Were empowered by the
souls of those victims.

06:10.160 --> 06:14.640
Legend says that whoever
opened the chest

06:14.640 --> 06:16.160
to retrieve them

06:16.160 --> 06:19.840
would be the one
to do battle.

06:19.840 --> 06:20.600
No.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.160
You opened the chest,
didn't you?

06:24.160 --> 06:25.240
Y-yeah, but--

06:25.240 --> 06:28.080
What's your name,
your full name?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.560
Russell Ian Keegan.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.720
So what?

06:32.840 --> 06:34.760
This belonged
to your ancestor.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.760
You are the one, lad.

06:36.760 --> 06:40.080
You have to finish
what he began 200 years ago!

06:40.080 --> 06:42.080
Forget it.
I'm just a kid.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.040
Perhaps you're right.

06:48.040 --> 06:52.200
I suppose it's easier to
hide behind the veil of youth

06:52.200 --> 06:54.200
than to face
the responsibility

06:54.200 --> 06:57.440
for a brother
you despise.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.200
I don't despise Max!

06:59.200 --> 07:01.520
I want him back!

07:01.520 --> 07:04.360
Then accept
your destiny.

07:37.840 --> 07:39.120
A cemetery!

07:39.120 --> 07:41.120
Perfect!

07:41.120 --> 07:43.120
Now what do we do?

07:43.120 --> 07:45.120
The spyglass
brought you here.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.120
You'll need these...

07:48.120 --> 07:49.760
To continue.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.120
What do I do with them?

07:53.120 --> 07:55.640
You'll know...

07:55.640 --> 07:57.120
When the time comes.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.640
Why are you
doing all this?

07:59.640 --> 08:01.560
If all goes well,

08:01.560 --> 08:03.560
a few pieces of treasure

08:03.560 --> 08:07.080
will help to fund some
of my unique endeavors.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.560
And if all doesn't
go well?

08:09.560 --> 08:11.560
It must!

08:11.560 --> 08:13.920
It's your destiny!

08:23.640 --> 08:25.560
I've done this before.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.000
It's like my dream.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.080
That means--

08:31.080 --> 08:32.080
Grandson.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.159
Aah!

08:34.200 --> 08:35.880
Who are you?

08:35.880 --> 08:38.600
Sir, you know
who I am.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.760
Ian Keegan?

08:45.320 --> 08:48.200
[With dread]
Oh, man.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.600
Look, I don't know
about any curse.

08:50.600 --> 08:53.600
All I want is
my brother back.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.800
The dagger
has the power.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.160
Grandson.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.040
Do not be fooled.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.040
What he wants

09:16.040 --> 09:19.400
is not what
he desires.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.000
What does that mean?

09:22.000 --> 09:24.520
All our hopes
go with you.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.960
Don't go.
You gotta help me!

10:08.600 --> 10:09.880
<i> Grandson.</i>

10:09.880 --> 10:11.560
<i> Look everywhere.</i>

10:19.680 --> 10:20.960
Yuck!

10:24.160 --> 10:25.600
Welcome aboard,
skipper!

10:25.600 --> 10:27.960
Ha ha ha ha
ha ha!

10:27.960 --> 10:30.000
Ha ha ha ha ha!

10:31.160 --> 10:32.800
Aah!

10:37.200 --> 10:38.960
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

10:38.960 --> 10:40.080
Aah!

10:50.520 --> 10:51.720
Swell.

10:51.720 --> 10:56.040
<i>Man: Not leavin'
so soon, are ya?</i>

10:56.040 --> 10:58.720
<i> You just came aboard.</i>

10:58.720 --> 11:01.240
Uh...I know who you are.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.720
<i> Do ya, now?</i>

11:02.720 --> 11:04.720
<i> Heh heh heh heh heh!</i>

11:04.720 --> 11:07.920
<i> Then let's see
if you can find me.</i>

11:18.560 --> 11:19.280
<i> Pity!</i>

11:21.240 --> 11:23.680
<i> Your first choice
was a poor one.</i>

11:23.680 --> 11:25.680
<i> Not a good start.</i>

11:38.000 --> 11:40.600
<i> Oh, careful, now.</i>

11:42.720 --> 11:45.680
<i> Get the point?
Hee hee hee!</i>

11:45.680 --> 11:47.680
Look, I'm no hero.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.680
I don't wanna
hurt you or anything.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.160
<i> Doh!</i>

11:52.160 --> 11:53.680
<i> Heh heh heh!</i>

11:53.680 --> 11:55.520
<i> Does I sound afraid?</i>

12:13.240 --> 12:16.440
<i> Mmm. This is gettin'
interestin'.</i>

12:16.440 --> 12:17.960
<i> Heh heh heh!</i>

12:17.960 --> 12:20.880
<i> Let's see what other fires
we can stop.</i>

12:20.880 --> 12:22.240
<i> Heh heh heh!</i>

12:35.200 --> 12:36.240
Max!

12:36.240 --> 12:38.600
Max! Are you OK?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.800
Come on, let's go!

12:42.200 --> 12:43.880
Come on! What's the--

12:46.200 --> 12:47.440
Sorry.

12:48.680 --> 12:52.040
Just... doin' me job.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.720
Rush!

13:32.120 --> 13:34.120
I-it's really you,
isn't it?

13:34.120 --> 13:35.640
Yeah! Get me
outta here!

13:37.640 --> 13:40.080
I didn't think
you were gonna come.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.560
What are you
talking about?

13:41.560 --> 13:43.560
You said you hated me.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.760
Look, Max, I said a lot of
stupid things I didn't mean.

13:47.760 --> 13:49.400
I'm sorry.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.560
Can I be on your
team again?

13:55.560 --> 13:57.560
Ha ha ha ha ha.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.360
Touching.
Very touching.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.760
Ha ha ha.

14:01.760 --> 14:06.200
I am so moved,
I can almost die!

14:06.200 --> 14:08.000
But then again...

14:08.000 --> 14:10.160
I am already dead.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.880
Look, I don't want
any trouble.

14:16.880 --> 14:21.000
But you went through all
that trouble trackin' me down!

14:21.000 --> 14:24.000
You went through all the
trouble running my gauntlet

14:24.000 --> 14:25.600
and dispatchin'
Mr. Noise!

14:25.600 --> 14:27.840
You went through
all the trouble

14:27.840 --> 14:29.600
breaking into
my treasure room!

14:29.600 --> 14:31.800
Yes, I think you're
looking for trouble,

14:31.800 --> 14:33.400
and, skipper,
you found it!

14:35.080 --> 14:36.200
Look...

14:37.920 --> 14:40.040
I didn't want
any part of this.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.280
You were the one--

14:41.280 --> 14:42.800
I've stood guard here

14:42.800 --> 14:45.320
for 2 centuries,

14:45.320 --> 14:48.800
waitin' for ya to come,
waiting for a grand battle!

14:48.800 --> 14:50.440
I don't wanna fight.

14:50.440 --> 14:54.840
Then you've come
to the wrong place!

14:58.080 --> 15:01.040
The fight will be
a fair one.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.760
I think swords
will do just fine.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.280
I--I don't have
a sword.

15:09.080 --> 15:10.080
Pity.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.800
Then you really
are in trouble!

15:21.480 --> 15:23.480
I have looked
forward to this.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.600
I haven't skewered anyone
in nearly 200 years!

15:31.520 --> 15:33.640
I'm enjoying this!

15:33.640 --> 15:35.120
Ha ha ha ha!

15:35.120 --> 15:37.120
You're forgetting, lad.
The dagger.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.160
Use the dagger!

16:03.200 --> 16:05.160
Is this it?

16:06.200 --> 16:08.120
Is this
the grand battle

16:08.120 --> 16:09.760
I've been waitin' for?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.240
Get up and fight!

16:11.240 --> 16:14.600
I can't. I don't
know what to do.

16:16.560 --> 16:20.400
Then there's nothin'
left for me to do...

16:20.400 --> 16:24.400
But to put ya out
of my misery.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.400
I don't think so!

16:26.400 --> 16:28.560
Leave him alone!

16:29.800 --> 16:33.040
Oh, 2 boys!

16:33.040 --> 16:33.840
2 boys.

16:35.480 --> 16:38.520
2 dead little boys!

16:38.520 --> 16:41.440
Who wants to go first?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.480
You do.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.920
How'd you do that?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.440
Good show, lads!

16:59.440 --> 17:01.920
There's only one thing
left to do.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.440
Who are you?

17:03.440 --> 17:06.440
You must run him through
with the dagger

17:06.440 --> 17:08.000
and fulfill your destiny.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.920
Come on, skipper!

17:09.920 --> 17:12.280
Use the bloody dagger!

17:12.280 --> 17:14.079
Ha ha ha!
You cannot hurt me!

17:14.079 --> 17:15.920
Ha ha ha ha ha!

17:15.920 --> 17:17.839
I'm already dead!

17:19.000 --> 17:20.359
Go on, lad.

17:20.359 --> 17:21.800
Use it.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.079
You won't do it,
will ya?

17:28.920 --> 17:32.400
Yer just a scared
little boy.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.320
How you fear the dagger!

17:38.120 --> 17:40.960
But your fear
should be of me!

17:42.280 --> 17:45.360
For I'll be comin'
after ya, skipper.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.360
But before that,

17:49.360 --> 17:52.720
I'll get your
little brother!

17:52.720 --> 17:53.800
No!

17:53.800 --> 17:56.640
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

17:59.000 --> 18:00.400
What's the trouble, lad?

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
What he wants

18:02.400 --> 18:05.080
is not what he desires.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.080
That's what Ian's ghost
said.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.800
He was a fool!

18:10.960 --> 18:12.600
Finish!
Finish the deed!

18:12.600 --> 18:13.880
No.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.440
This isn't right.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.280
You're afraid,
aren't ya?

18:18.280 --> 18:19.800
Yeah, I am.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.800
And I think
you are, too.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.880
You've been guarding
this treasure,

18:23.880 --> 18:27.240
but there's no one
to guard it from.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.560
That's why you took Max.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.480
<i>To make sure
I would come.</i>

18:34.800 --> 18:36.720
You wanted
one last battle.

18:36.720 --> 18:38.320
Nonsense talk!

18:38.320 --> 18:40.360
Use the dagger!

18:40.360 --> 18:43.480
This treasure's no good
to you anymore, is it?

18:43.480 --> 18:45.880
But you have to
guard it forever.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.880
I believe
you're right, lad.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.640
Use the dagger, and
Cutter's wretched soul

18:50.640 --> 18:52.640
may be released
from this prison!

18:52.640 --> 18:54.120
No, it's not true!

18:54.120 --> 18:55.640
What do I do?

18:55.640 --> 18:58.880
Justice
for Cutter's victims

18:58.880 --> 19:00.880
is in your hands.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.480
Use it wisely.

19:03.480 --> 19:05.400
Use it, blast ya!

19:05.400 --> 19:06.960
Use it!

19:13.920 --> 19:15.400
Curse ya!

19:15.400 --> 19:17.840
Curse ya all!

19:17.840 --> 19:18.920
[Rumbling]

19:18.920 --> 19:20.320
It's caving in!

19:20.320 --> 19:21.840
Where'd he go?

19:21.840 --> 19:23.720
Come on.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.000
Ah, you cowards!

19:33.000 --> 19:35.160
Cowards all!

19:40.160 --> 19:41.080
No!

19:41.080 --> 19:43.000
No, don't leave me here!

19:44.400 --> 19:45.160
Go!

19:48.240 --> 19:49.160
No!

19:49.160 --> 19:51.160
Please don't
leave me alone!

19:51.160 --> 19:53.400
Noooooo!

20:04.840 --> 20:06.200
Come on! Hurry!

20:19.000 --> 20:20.080
Grab my hand!

20:36.160 --> 20:37.280
Pull!

20:40.520 --> 20:41.960
I gotcha! Come on!

20:54.880 --> 20:56.080
Cool!

20:57.160 --> 20:59.120
Grandson.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.520
I'm proud of you.

21:03.520 --> 21:06.160
Did I do
the right thing?

21:06.160 --> 21:10.320
The dagger was meant to punish
Cutter for his evil ways,

21:10.320 --> 21:12.320
and that's what
was done.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.440
Aye, ya did
the right thing.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.880
Farewell,
grandsons.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.720
Thank you.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.240
<i>No one's ever
gonna believe this.</i>

21:40.240 --> 21:42.560
Good show, lads!

21:42.560 --> 21:44.600
What happened to you?

21:44.600 --> 21:47.600
I thought it best to leave
you to your own devices.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.600
After all,
this is your adventure.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.240
Sorry you didn't get
the treasure you wanted.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.880
No matter!
Treasure doesn't last.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.880
It's the adventure,
the excitement,

21:55.880 --> 21:57.000
the game!

21:57.000 --> 21:59.880
That's what stays
with you a lifetime.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.080
Remember that.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.480
Though a little treasure
never hurt, right?

22:07.840 --> 22:09.080
Wow!

22:09.080 --> 22:12.080
I guess you didn't
come away empty-handed.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.600
No, but I did!

22:13.600 --> 22:15.080
We had a deal.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.080
I delivered.
Now I expect you to.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.840
Please. I intend
to double your fee.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.200
Double.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.200
Oh, well.
That's different.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.200
Uh... maybe we
could, uh...

22:27.200 --> 22:28.720
[Horn honks]

22:28.720 --> 22:30.600
Mom and Dad!

22:33.280 --> 22:35.480
I don't know who
you guys are,

22:35.480 --> 22:38.600
but I don't think
I'll ever forget you.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.840
Listen...

22:43.840 --> 22:45.200
What other little
adventures

22:45.200 --> 22:48.480
do you think we might be
able to cook up together?

22:48.480 --> 22:50.080
Mom, Dad!

22:51.280 --> 22:52.680
Whoa!
What's this about?

22:52.680 --> 22:54.680
You're never gonna
believe this--

22:54.680 --> 22:56.200
You're never
gonna believe this.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.200
We had the most
amazing weekend.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.800
Wait'll we tell ya. It's the most
unbelievable thing you ever heard.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.320
[Sighs]

23:06.280 --> 23:08.360
Are we gonna
tell them?

23:14.760 --> 23:16.600
I don't think so.

23:18.120 --> 23:22.640
Rush and Matt never told
anyone their adventures

23:22.640 --> 23:24.160
because
they were afraid

23:24.160 --> 23:26.160
someone might look
for Cutter's treasure.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.640
If they found it,

23:27.640 --> 23:30.640
they'd also find the ghost
of the pirate captain,

23:30.640 --> 23:34.200
lying in wait
for one last battle.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.960
The end.
The end.

23:37.960 --> 23:38.960
Awesome story.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.160
Excellent!

23:41.160 --> 23:43.800
That was a really
awesome story.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.640
I declare this meeting
of the Midnight Society

23:46.640 --> 23:47.760
closed.
