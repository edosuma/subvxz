04:42.716 --> 04:43.982
How would you know?

04:43.984 --> 04:46.018
I was Fatso's agent.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.352
Annie Dubinsky.

04:47.354 --> 04:50.522
If you ever hear a star's name
and wonder, is he dead?

04:50.524 --> 04:53.191
The answer is either
I represent him or yes.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.694
Now, let me ask you something:
is there a place for

04:55.696 --> 04:58.830
an old-fashioned lard-ass
like me on today's television?

04:58.832 --> 05:02.834
Um, would you play a
bloated corpse on<i> CSI?</i>

05:02.836 --> 05:04.169
Would I?!

05:05.839 --> 05:08.373
Wow, that's good
bloat work!

05:08.375 --> 05:11.043
He always comes back
really religious.

05:12.346 --> 05:14.946
You're killing me here
with this Catchy and Patchy.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.815
I'm barely on my own show.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.184
Today's kids are uncomfortable
with a clown

05:19.186 --> 05:22.020
whose every reference they have
to look up on Wikipedia.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.956
Wikipedia, Twitter--
who names these things?

05:24.958 --> 05:26.425
Percy Dovetonsils?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.593
(laughs)

05:28.595 --> 05:29.928

05:29.930 --> 05:34.599
Come on, he was on Ernie Kovacs
with a smoking jacket...

05:35.636 --> 05:36.668
Krusty,

05:36.670 --> 05:38.670
we want to make some changes.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.372
What kind of changes?

05:40.374 --> 05:44.009
Krusty, um, this is never easy,

05:44.011 --> 05:45.777
but you're fired.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.479
Oh, that<i> was</i> easy.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.714
Oh, no!

05:48.716 --> 05:50.982
My contract states
there's only one way

05:50.984 --> 05:52.718
you're allowed to fire me!

05:52.720 --> 05:55.120
(drumroll)

05:55.122 --> 05:57.656
Yep, everything's
nice and legal!

06:00.527 --> 06:01.660
(groans)

06:01.662 --> 06:03.495
Could this be
more awkward?

06:05.499 --> 06:09.334
They took my dressing room, my
parking space, even my writer,

06:09.336 --> 06:11.336
so I don't have a
funny third item.

06:11.338 --> 06:15.674
But at least I got you,
my agent and best friend.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.042
(sighs)

06:17.044 --> 06:19.010
Krustila, I'm gonna
drop you as a friend first,

06:19.012 --> 06:21.046
so that when I drop you
as a client,

06:21.048 --> 06:22.681
you'll know it's only business.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.282
But we shared everything!

06:24.284 --> 06:26.485
Boats, girlfriends, condos.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.821
And when I finished, every one
of them was spic and span.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.090
Krusty, I'm gonna prove
that it's over.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.326
What? I'm on
your garage door opener?

06:34.328 --> 06:36.495
It's a smartphone,
you out-of-it hack.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.165
(groans)

06:42.703 --> 06:44.269
Little help?

06:44.271 --> 06:47.506
This only shuts the door.

06:48.876 --> 06:52.544
So, what was everyone's
favorite moment at the museum?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.946
I liked the
knowledgeable docents.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.282
I liked the early
closing time.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.617
(sobbing)

06:58.619 --> 06:59.684
Krusty?

06:59.686 --> 07:02.287
Fate is so cruel.

07:02.289 --> 07:06.024
This morning I was a star,
with a top agent.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.860
Now I'm strung out
in a ball pit!

07:08.862 --> 07:10.829
(sobbing)

07:10.831 --> 07:12.264
Go away.

07:12.266 --> 07:15.267
No kid should see
his hero sunk so low.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.002
Well, you're not
exactly my hero.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.137
I see you more as
a cautionary tale.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.338
What?!

07:20.340 --> 07:22.174
I'll show you
who's a cautionary tale.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.542
(grunting)

07:23.544 --> 07:26.011
I'll show everybody!

07:29.950 --> 07:31.049
You're not licked,
Krusty.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.284
People love a comeback.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.886
Look at Robert Downey Jr.,
Mickey Rourke.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.322
I don't know if
I got it in me.

07:37.324 --> 07:39.257
Well, people also
love a quitter--

07:39.259 --> 07:40.959
Sarah Palin, The Beatles...

07:40.961 --> 07:43.328
Eh, it's hopeless
without an agent.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.763
You need an agent?

07:44.765 --> 07:46.097
We met a ten percenter today.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.833
She'll get you meetings
with the eye,

07:47.835 --> 07:49.534
the peacock,
the alphabet web.

07:49.536 --> 07:52.037
You'll have a skein on the sked
before you can say

07:52.039 --> 07:55.340
"Krusty's wardrobe furnished by
Ha-Has of Beverly Hills."

07:55.342 --> 07:56.975
A new agent?!

07:56.977 --> 07:58.109
I better freshen up.

07:59.112 --> 08:02.047
(humming)

08:02.049 --> 08:05.283
Also better get back on
those anti-psychotic meds.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.285
(dog howling)

08:07.287 --> 08:10.188
Oh, this is a bad sign.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.324
I've been to classier
gas stations.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.925
(laughs)

08:13.927 --> 08:15.861
I know that laugh!

08:15.863 --> 08:17.796
It's the laugh of
the most ungrateful,

08:17.798 --> 08:19.364
credit-grabbing,

08:19.366 --> 08:22.267
other-people's-room-service-
eating man that I ever met.

08:22.269 --> 08:26.037
I will never forgive you
for what you did to me.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.640
Krusty, you know her?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.208
She sure knows me.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.014
Ms. Dubinsky,
can you please just tell us

08:36.016 --> 08:37.282
why you hate Krusty?

08:37.284 --> 08:39.451
Come on in.

08:39.453 --> 08:41.119
It's a long story.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.288
(groans): Oh, now
I hate him, too.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.257
It was the mid '60s.

08:45.259 --> 08:47.526
<i>I was a virgin agent,</i>

08:47.528 --> 08:50.095
<i>looking for a first client</i>
<i>or a fourth husband.</i>

08:50.097 --> 08:51.530
<i>And then I saw him.</i>

08:51.532 --> 08:52.864
Hey-hey.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.165
Scary world.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.968
They start with the A-bomb,
then skip right to the H-bomb.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.204
These geniuses can
blow up the planet,

08:59.206 --> 09:00.839
but they don't know
the alphabet.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.041
(laughter)

09:04.845 --> 09:06.645
<i>I knew he could be big.</i>

09:06.647 --> 09:08.446
<i>He just needed</i>
<i>some savvy fingers</i>

09:08.448 --> 09:11.449
<i>to mold his clay into an Ali.</i>

09:12.386 --> 09:14.819
Herschel, you killed
them tonight!

09:14.821 --> 09:18.189
(chuckles) There wasn't a
dry turtleneck in the house.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.958
But mark my words:

09:19.960 --> 09:21.960
the bohemian crowd
is small potatoes.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.795
You're gonna have to
broaden your act

09:23.797 --> 09:25.330
if you want to play in Peoria.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.965
I don't want
to play in Peoria.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.668
They're always doing
construction on Highway 74.

09:29.670 --> 09:33.004
I mean, if you want to hit it
big, you got to lose this...

09:35.275 --> 09:37.409
stick this on...

09:38.879 --> 09:41.279
and make your comedy
a touch more physical.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.647
How do I do that?

09:42.649 --> 09:44.015
Like so.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.084
(screaming)

09:47.988 --> 09:50.522
(laughter)

09:50.524 --> 09:51.656
(chuckles)

09:51.658 --> 09:52.924
Wow.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.794
This is the best kind of
comedy of all: cheap!

09:55.796 --> 09:59.164
Herschel, you are gonna get
everything you want:

09:59.166 --> 10:00.799
money and women...

10:00.801 --> 10:02.601
There's only one
thing I want:

10:02.603 --> 10:04.369
ice for my ding-dong!

10:04.371 --> 10:05.937
And you.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.306
<i>Every night, he had them</i>
<i>rolling in the aisles,</i>

10:08.308 --> 10:10.942
<i>followed by a roll</i>
<i>in the hey-hey with me.</i>

10:17.351 --> 10:20.118
This is the part where I get
the kids out of the room.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.519
Oh, grow up.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.489
Today's kids are less sensitive
than an army condom.

10:24.491 --> 10:27.826
They see more on TV than my
mother did on her wedding night.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.528
And they don't complain about it
for the next 50 years.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.832
I got big plans
for us, Krusty.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.467
This is just
the beginning.

10:35.469 --> 10:37.802
Actually, sweetheart,
it's the end.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.972
I'm leaving you for Ron
Rabinowitz at United Parasites.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.041
You waited until now
to tell me that?!

10:43.043 --> 10:45.710
I can only tell the truth
right after sex.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.946
But all during sex
I was thinking it.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.147
Get out!

10:49.149 --> 10:50.982
(groans)

10:50.984 --> 10:53.118
You ungrateful pig!

10:53.120 --> 10:55.020
I made you!

10:55.022 --> 10:57.856
Deep down, I'm doing this
to get back at my father.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.257
Don't blame
this on me.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.192
Your childhood
was heaven.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.661
(groans)

11:02.663 --> 11:04.195
I was so mad at him

11:04.197 --> 11:06.831
I didn't have sex with a clown
for five months.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.932
What about mimes?

11:07.934 --> 11:09.968
Come on.
I'm not made of stone.

11:09.970 --> 11:14.439
Annie, would you ever consider
taking Krusty back as a client?

11:14.441 --> 11:17.175
No! Absolutely not!

11:17.177 --> 11:19.844
Trust with me is
like a candle.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.547
When you blow it out,
it's gone for good.

11:22.549 --> 11:24.115
What about a comedy candle?

11:24.117 --> 11:26.384
You know, that relights itself?

11:26.386 --> 11:28.553
I don't find those funny,
just frustrating.

11:28.555 --> 11:29.621
They're pretty funny.

11:29.623 --> 11:30.855
Once, I used one on Milhouse.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.291
He was wishing for his parents
to get back together,

11:33.293 --> 11:34.793
but the flame never went out.

11:34.795 --> 11:35.927
(blows raspberry, laughs)

11:35.929 --> 11:37.529
(chuckles)
Good one, boy.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.665
Annie, I'm down on
my rebuilt knee.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.001
Can't you forgive me?
Please?

11:43.003 --> 11:46.104
For the sake of me
getting what I want?

11:48.775 --> 11:51.376
(chuckles) Fine.
But no nonsense.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.844
Except, of course,
during working hours,

11:52.846 --> 11:54.846
then it's all nonsense.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.048
Great. So we're booked

11:57.050 --> 12:00.051
for three weeks in June
at the Springfield Playhouse.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.855
I promise you Krusty will show
up on time or sober.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.191
Yeah, that's right, I said "or."

12:06.193 --> 12:08.259
Let me get this straight:

12:08.261 --> 12:10.695
you want me
to do my kids' show for adults?

12:10.697 --> 12:13.264
They're gonna want F-bombs and
all I can give 'em is

12:13.266 --> 12:14.933
"ca-ca" and "ta-tas."

12:14.935 --> 12:18.536
Krusty, there is nothing people
love more than the things

12:18.538 --> 12:19.971
they loved when they were kids.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.440
So you re-create
your show for adults!

12:22.442 --> 12:24.809
It worked like magic
for Pee-Wee Herman

12:24.811 --> 12:26.277
after his setback.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.879
What did he get in trouble for?

12:27.881 --> 12:29.814
(whispering)

12:29.816 --> 12:30.949
That's all?!

12:30.951 --> 12:33.918
I did that while
you were on the phone!

12:38.191 --> 12:40.158
You know, I'm
a little nervous

12:40.160 --> 12:42.093
about doing
live theater again.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.429
Come on. Didn't you do
your TV show in front

12:44.431 --> 12:45.830
of an audience
for years?

12:45.832 --> 12:49.000
Yeah, but they were kids and we
gave 'em candy if they laughed.

12:49.002 --> 12:49.934
And if they didn't,

12:49.936 --> 12:52.704
until the '70s,
I hit 'em with a stick.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.939
Some jerk tracked down the kids
and made a documentary.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.475
It's called<i> Circus of Shame</i>
or something.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.043
(drum roll)

12:59.045 --> 13:01.546
And now, let's welcome a man

13:01.548 --> 13:07.018
the Spanish call "Señor No-Fun":
Krusty the Clown!

13:07.020 --> 13:08.887
(cheers)
Hey-hey, kids!

13:08.889 --> 13:10.955
ALL:
Hey-hey, Krusty!

13:10.957 --> 13:13.158
Who here likes nostalgia?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.359
(all cheer)

13:14.361 --> 13:16.528
Everything's perfect
about the past

13:16.530 --> 13:18.129
except how it led
to the present.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.000
Then welcome back the original
Tick-Tock the Clock!

13:22.002 --> 13:24.669
Would that I could
turn back time

13:24.671 --> 13:27.005
and never play this
career-killing role.

13:27.007 --> 13:32.210
Ooh, looks like Tick-Tock is
telling us it's time for...

13:32.212 --> 13:35.180
ALL:
What's In Krusty's Pocket?!

13:35.182 --> 13:37.649
Mmm. Ah!

13:37.651 --> 13:39.884
(chuckles)

13:43.023 --> 13:44.389
(cheering)

13:47.928 --> 13:50.595
I've pulled out everything
but my Little Krusty.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.631
Aw, what the heck?

13:53.633 --> 13:55.099
(audience laughs)

13:57.704 --> 13:59.304
Oh, that was great, man!

13:59.306 --> 14:01.673
I feel like I'm
ten again!

14:01.675 --> 14:03.541
Everything I loved
as a kid

14:03.543 --> 14:06.311
and hated as a teenager
I love as an adult!

14:06.313 --> 14:08.179
No one knows better
than me

14:08.181 --> 14:11.049
that it's "Here today,
gone tomorrow."

14:11.051 --> 14:13.718
But I'm here today!

14:13.720 --> 14:15.486
Thanks to you, honey!

14:15.488 --> 14:17.522
BOTH:
Mmm... mwa!

14:17.524 --> 14:18.957
Uh, um, sorry...

14:18.959 --> 14:20.892
This one, I think,
is mine.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.160
Yeah, I'll take that...

14:22.162 --> 14:23.294
I'll, give me
that one.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.996
Well, that looks
better on you, honey.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.698
Yeah.
No, no, no,
it screams you.

14:26.700 --> 14:27.832
Let's just keep smooching

14:27.834 --> 14:29.667
till everything sorts
itself out.

14:29.669 --> 14:30.902
Mmm... I'm done.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.276
Krusty, you're getting
the best reviews of your career!

14:38.278 --> 14:40.378
Yep! I'm back on top!

14:40.380 --> 14:44.315
And this time I'm not blowing it
on cocaine for my horses.

14:44.317 --> 14:47.452
They start well, then they get
paranoid around the third turn.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.687
And you'll have plenty
to invest.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.023
The networks have
come crawling.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.558
Which ones? Telebozo?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.960
Shtick at Nite? E.S.P.U.?

14:55.962 --> 14:57.629
Better, baby.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.864
Our premium cable network is
a little different

14:59.866 --> 15:01.299
from what you're used to.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.534
Our brand is classy
and upscale.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.504
And we pay for everything
with soft porno and boxing.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.674
Wait a minute.
There's<i> soft</i> porno?

15:09.676 --> 15:11.542
And here you don't have
to worry about budgets,

15:11.544 --> 15:13.044
and the critics are
in our pocket.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.712
Even the<i> Boston Phoenix?</i>

15:14.714 --> 15:17.115
If not, we'll burn it
to the ground!

15:17.117 --> 15:19.317
And that will be the end
of that phoenix.

15:19.319 --> 15:23.488
All good. I just have one
non-negotiable demand:

15:23.490 --> 15:27.558
This brass begonia here is
my producer now

15:27.560 --> 15:29.761
until the end of time.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.296
Really?
Yep.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.932
And you know
that anything said

15:33.934 --> 15:37.368
at a network pitch meeting
can be taken to the bank.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.675
♪ ♪

15:49.983 --> 15:52.116
Krusty, my man,
you finally hit it big.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.451
You said it!

15:53.453 --> 15:56.220
The<i> Entourage</i> actors are
now my interns!

15:56.222 --> 15:57.555
I got your coffees,
Mr. K.!

15:57.557 --> 15:59.057
Too hot!

15:59.059 --> 16:00.358
Too cold!

16:03.029 --> 16:03.995
Genius!

16:03.997 --> 16:05.430
No, no, no!

16:05.432 --> 16:06.998
What, are you crazy?!

16:07.000 --> 16:08.833
You can't put
a green wall behind

16:08.835 --> 16:10.601
a clown with green hair!

16:10.603 --> 16:12.003
Beloved entertainer...

16:12.005 --> 16:12.837
sad old man!

16:12.839 --> 16:14.439
Beloved entertainer...

16:14.441 --> 16:16.040
sad old man!

16:16.042 --> 16:19.978
He ain't changing, so everything
else in the world has to!

16:19.980 --> 16:21.846
(hushed):
Annie, it's your first day
on the set.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.948
Scream something nice.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.951
Krusty, I am here to serve
you and no one else.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.954
"Nice" gets booked
at birthday parties!

16:29.956 --> 16:32.957
Hey, birthday parties got me
through some tough times.

16:32.959 --> 16:35.560
For years I lived on
piñata candy!

16:35.562 --> 16:38.763
Yeah? Well, from now on
the only birthday parties

16:38.765 --> 16:40.865
you are gonna do are
for the insane sons

16:40.867 --> 16:42.967
of rich Middle Eastern
dictators.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.702
Your going rate is 100
barrels of oil.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.971
Whoa, that's Beyoncé volume.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.406
(chimp grunts)

16:51.845 --> 16:54.445
(chatters)

16:57.684 --> 17:00.018
(laughs)

17:00.020 --> 17:02.720
Wait one hairy, banana-peeling,
scene-stealing minute here!

17:02.722 --> 17:03.888
Wha...?
What'd I do?

17:03.890 --> 17:05.623
Whose show is this?
Huh? Huh?!

17:05.625 --> 17:06.891
Whose name is on
that sign?!

17:06.893 --> 17:08.693
(chatters)

17:08.695 --> 17:10.995
Yeah, that's right,
little buddy boy!

17:10.997 --> 17:11.829
Krusty! Krusty!

17:11.831 --> 17:14.198
And don't you ever
upstage him

17:14.200 --> 17:16.701
or craft service will be
serving chimp tacos!

17:16.703 --> 17:17.969
(drooling)

17:17.971 --> 17:20.271
Yeah, I'd like to squeeze
a lime on that!

17:20.273 --> 17:21.005
(chuckles)

17:21.007 --> 17:24.509
(whimpering)

17:24.511 --> 17:26.711
Now apologize to Krusty!

17:26.713 --> 17:29.047
(chatters)

17:30.216 --> 17:31.682
(hushed):
Not so hard.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.518
She'll know
we have a past.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.953
What's going on,
yanking me out
of my<i> schvitz?!</i>

17:35.955 --> 17:37.855
I look like an unwrapped mummy.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.991
Ooh! Idea for sketch:
rapping mummy.

17:39.993 --> 17:42.293
Notorious T-U-T.
It writes itself.

17:42.295 --> 17:43.795
Find someone to write it.

17:43.797 --> 17:44.929
Where's Annie?

17:44.931 --> 17:46.664
Annie is what we need
to discuss.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.965
She's out of control.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.768
She called a network
vice president "unhip."

17:50.770 --> 17:53.104
And he reads<i> GQ</i>
and he's straight.

17:53.106 --> 17:55.273
And recently
we had this incident.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.443
(gasping) Wait!
What are you doing?!

17:58.445 --> 17:59.710
She claimed this intern

17:59.712 --> 18:01.779
sharpened her pencil
"too pointy."

18:01.781 --> 18:04.949
Oh, I see what's
going on here:

18:04.951 --> 18:07.452
if a woman does it,
she's a bitch.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.288
But in a man,
those traits would
be considered...

18:10.290 --> 18:11.189
Uh-oh!

18:11.191 --> 18:12.390
(gasping)

18:12.392 --> 18:14.625
(tires squeal)

18:14.627 --> 18:17.462
That hallway looks
familiar.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.297
I'm only getting
college credit for this!

18:19.299 --> 18:20.431
(crash)
My legs!

18:20.433 --> 18:21.532
(groans)

18:26.372 --> 18:28.106
Wow, I can't believe
we're in the audience

18:28.108 --> 18:29.674
of a pay-cable show!

18:29.676 --> 18:33.478
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
Krusty's favorite part

18:33.480 --> 18:36.481
of the taping: talking to the
audience before the show.

18:36.483 --> 18:39.517
Hey-how-are-ya-don't-talk-to-me
-the-show's-starting.

18:39.519 --> 18:40.885
(all muttering)

18:40.887 --> 18:45.857
And now... the clown
that never lets you down...

18:45.859 --> 18:50.795
Krusty the... Clown!

18:52.699 --> 18:55.666
Hey, hey, premium cable
subscribers! (applause)

18:55.668 --> 19:00.104
Tonight we've got the cast of
the hit<i> Boardwalk Vampire!</i>

19:00.106 --> 19:03.007
We've also got Janeane Garofolo.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.041
Wait a minute!

19:04.043 --> 19:06.844
We have very specific
language in our contract

19:06.846 --> 19:10.381
saying "No guests who are
funnier than Krusty."

19:10.383 --> 19:13.284
Janeane has promised to be
strictly angry and polemical.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.887
And I'll keep my promise,
like Obama did with Guantanamo.

19:15.889 --> 19:17.221
(cheers, applause)

19:17.223 --> 19:20.458
Oh! That's funnier
than I can ever hope to be!

19:20.460 --> 19:23.294
Sorry, Janeane.
Grab some shrimp and go.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.763
You can fill
your stupid beret once.

19:25.765 --> 19:29.467
Burn on you! I brought
my expandable beret!

19:29.469 --> 19:30.768
(audience cheers)

19:30.770 --> 19:32.870
Krusty, this is
exactly the kind of meddling

19:32.872 --> 19:34.872
that only we're allowed to do.

19:34.874 --> 19:36.274
Fire her as we discussed!

19:36.276 --> 19:37.942
Don't make us
threaten you.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.677
Krusty?!

19:39.679 --> 19:41.012
What did you tell them?

19:41.014 --> 19:43.181
Oh, I, I did that laugh
that people interpret

19:43.183 --> 19:44.315
any way they want.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.617
(laughs nervously)

19:46.619 --> 19:48.853
I thought that laugh meant
"I love you."

19:48.855 --> 19:50.988
It can...

19:50.990 --> 19:52.890
Well, there's no room
for waffling anymore.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.725
You're with me
forever or never.

19:54.727 --> 19:55.793
Which is it?

19:55.795 --> 19:57.995
What, uh, when you said...

19:57.997 --> 19:59.263
(laughs nervously)

19:59.265 --> 20:00.831
I'm paying extra
for this channel?

20:00.833 --> 20:03.534
Hasn't been good since
<i>The Wire.</i> Ah, who am I kidding?

20:03.536 --> 20:04.802
I never watched<i> The Wire.</i>

20:04.804 --> 20:07.638
