00:00.668 --> 00:03.202
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:03.204 --> 00:05.004
<i> the people are represented</i>

00:05.006 --> 00:07.306
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:07.308 --> 00:09.274
<i> the police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:12.578
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:12.580 --> 00:14.179
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:14.181 --> 00:17.116
(<i> garbled radio transmission</i> )

00:25.059 --> 00:27.192
This damn
Indian winter, man.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.560
That's summer, genius.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.596
No such thing
as Indian winter.

00:30.598 --> 00:33.365
When it's this cold
this late in the year,

00:33.367 --> 00:35.601
it is definitely
somebody's fault.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.370
Oh, so blame it
on the Native Americans?

00:38.372 --> 00:41.073
You got somebody
better to blame?

00:41.075 --> 00:42.508
The problem with the world--

00:42.510 --> 00:44.243
crap doesn't just happen.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.311
It's got to be
someone's fault.

00:46.313 --> 00:49.114
Yeah, well, it keeps us
in business.

00:49.116 --> 00:51.450
It makes a lot
of lawyers rich.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.052
Early morning jog?

00:53.054 --> 00:55.187
Five to two
they did something.

00:55.189 --> 00:58.457
Well, it's too cold
to find out exactly what.

00:58.459 --> 01:01.493
RADIO DISPATCHER:
Holding suspect
at 496 Broadway.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.628
Are you...

01:02.630 --> 01:04.463
Look at this.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.665
Bobby, it's freezing
outside, man.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.467
What harm could it do?

01:08.469 --> 01:09.468
There's smoke.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.136
Maybe there's fire.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.305
Could be a medal of honor
in this.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.406
Hey, you coming?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.108
In and out.
In and out.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.677
to finish my coffee?
How am I supposed

01:18.679 --> 01:21.613
I'm coming back as a C.P.A.
Next lifetime

01:21.615 --> 01:23.082
No outdoor work.

01:23.084 --> 01:25.350
a damn trash fire.
Bobby, it's

01:25.352 --> 01:27.152
Trash my ass.

01:27.154 --> 01:29.088
That's a body.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.423
MAN:
<i> So far not a whole lot.</i>

01:31.425 --> 01:32.858
Flame burned evenly.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.426
Hardly touched the skin.

01:34.428 --> 01:38.097
Multiple bruises, fractures--
all from a blunt object.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.132
Still, your clothes are on fire

01:40.134 --> 01:42.568
you're going to be doing
a rain dance.

01:42.570 --> 01:46.138
This guy was probably dead
before they torched him.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.479
We've also got
a mess of footprints.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.582
See if you
can size it.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.383
You caught it?

01:58.385 --> 02:00.185
We saw the flames
from the car.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.587
You got any witnesses?

02:01.589 --> 02:04.189
None standing on line
to be interviewed.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.191
He's beaten, then burned.
He had to scream.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.326
Somebody had to hear it.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.727
I don't know
if this means anything,

02:08.729 --> 02:11.196
but right before
we found the body,

02:11.198 --> 02:14.666
we saw four or five black kids
run by, heading uptown.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.401
Could you pick them out?

02:16.403 --> 02:18.537
The victim's name
is Ezra Shore.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.906
He lives over
on Columbus Avenue.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.609
I thought this only
happened in Brooklyn.

02:23.611 --> 02:24.610
Come again?

02:24.612 --> 02:25.911
You didn't tell him?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.713
The dead guy was wearing

02:27.715 --> 02:30.649
one of those Jewish
beanie things.

02:30.651 --> 02:34.319
Son, that's called
a<i> yarmulkah.</i>

02:38.759 --> 02:43.162
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/Universal

03:59.873 --> 04:02.441
He wasn't just beaten;
he was brutalized.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.842
The smoke clears on this,

04:03.844 --> 04:05.577
it will be
Crown Heights revisited.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.748
There is no evidence
that this is a hate crime, Mike.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.884
Did you look
at these photographs?

04:11.885 --> 04:14.019
Two uniforms on the scene
said some black kids...

04:14.021 --> 04:15.988
Run across
the street.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.489
You've seen this played out
before.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.324
We jump to conclusions.

04:19.326 --> 04:21.593
The press follows our lead.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.861
The waters get so muddy
that we never see the bottom.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.998
Should we treat it
like a mugging?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.867
No. I want to treat it
like a homicide.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.336
We play
the usuals.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.605
Family, friends, business...

04:33.607 --> 04:36.475
We're just spinning our wheels
we go that way.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.477
Maybe not;
Ezra was brutalized.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.446
That means there should
be blood all over,

04:41.448 --> 04:44.483
but C.S.U. didn't find
near the scene.anywhere

04:44.485 --> 04:47.486
So they killed him someplace
in the alley.ed him

04:47.488 --> 04:49.821
But hate crimes
are crimes of fear.

04:49.823 --> 04:52.357
The bodies usually
don't get moved.

04:52.359 --> 04:53.592
And the fire?

04:53.594 --> 04:54.793
Destroying evidence.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.561
Or sending a message.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.630
You know what
might be helpful?

04:58.632 --> 05:03.001
If we could find out something
about the departed Mr. Shore.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.939
WOMAN:
<i> that killed him,re</i>

05:07.941 --> 05:09.308
it was the beating.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.476
Blood oxygen analysis,

05:10.477 --> 05:11.643
he was dead
before they torched him.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.912
You think there were
more than one?

05:13.914 --> 05:15.514
Angle of blows to the head,

05:15.516 --> 05:18.350
chest, broken vertebrae
in the spine...

05:18.352 --> 05:19.484
yeah, I'd say so.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.086
Yeah. That
or a mack truck.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.521
Did he put up a fight?

05:22.523 --> 05:24.523
Well, he didn't go gentle.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.992
Defensive wounds
on the hands and arms.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.527
Fingernail scrapings.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.062
We got some dried blood.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.930
Enough to tell a story?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.965
Not enough to DNA.
Sorry.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.600
But one was type-AB.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.469
Hey, that narrows it down.

05:37.471 --> 05:40.539
Well, this is just
a preliminary, Mike.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.476
Ezra called me from the store.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.879
It must have been around 6:00.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.654
That was the last time
you talked to him?

05:55.656 --> 06:00.559
He said he would be
working late with Isaac.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.961
"Go ahead," he said.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.663
Eat without him.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.631
Isaac?

06:06.633 --> 06:08.633
His brother.

06:10.938 --> 06:15.640
What business is
your husband in, Mrs. Shore?

06:15.642 --> 06:17.576
Jewels.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.511
Diamonds mostly.

06:19.513 --> 06:23.014
He has his own store
on West 47th Street.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.020
Was business good?

06:29.022 --> 06:31.590
I don't understand.

06:31.592 --> 06:35.594
Well, sometimes if there's
a problem with cash flow,

06:35.596 --> 06:38.163
one might be induced
to borrow money

06:38.165 --> 06:39.931
from the wrong people.

06:39.933 --> 06:44.936
My husband did very well,
Detective.

06:44.938 --> 06:49.441
One shouldn't be saying
<i>yizkor</i> for a man of 45.

06:49.443 --> 06:52.010
It's the prayer
for the dead.

06:56.150 --> 06:59.418
Do you have any idea who...?

07:01.422 --> 07:03.655
Well, there was something.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.658
Every now and then
they hassled me and Ben

07:06.660 --> 07:10.162
on the way back from school--
these black kids.

07:10.164 --> 07:11.496
It's no big deal.

07:11.498 --> 07:14.099
The police should know
everything, Caleb.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.200
Now they do.

07:15.202 --> 07:18.120
Is there a possibility

07:18.121 --> 07:21.039
that your husband was carrying
the jewelry on him when...?

07:21.041 --> 07:26.077
Anything that would relate
to the business,

07:26.079 --> 07:29.648
you would have to ask Isaac.

07:29.650 --> 07:33.718
He's probably at the shop
closing up right now.

07:35.489 --> 07:39.024
Father died 15 years ago.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.560
Ezra never missed a beat.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.528
He took over the business?

07:43.530 --> 07:45.163
I was independent.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.200
I thought
I didn't need the family.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.001
I learned the hard way.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.204
Six years ago Ezra took me in.

07:52.206 --> 07:55.507
Rachel said you were here
with him last night.

07:55.509 --> 08:01.079
We went over inventories
till maybe about 8:00.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.648
And then?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.617
I left.

08:05.619 --> 08:11.656
If I knew it was going
to be the last time...

08:11.658 --> 08:14.626
we had words...

08:14.628 --> 08:17.529
had a disagreement

08:17.531 --> 08:19.498
over purchase orders.

08:20.567 --> 08:24.102
Did he ever carry
the stones on him?

08:24.104 --> 08:26.505
Oh, sure.

08:40.220 --> 08:45.223
He signed out lot 492,
six stones.

08:45.225 --> 08:52.030
Worth probably ten, 12,000.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.599
I'm sure he had
a late sales meeting.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.568
He often visited clients

08:56.570 --> 08:58.904
after store hours.

08:58.905 --> 09:01.239
He'd walk around with that much
in his pocket?

09:01.241 --> 09:02.674
In a briefcase.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.676
It's the way
we do business.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.578
Mind if I look?

09:06.580 --> 09:08.313
Please.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.234
The meeting.

09:12.235 --> 09:14.319
Do you know
where it was or with whom?

09:14.321 --> 09:16.855
Ezra lived for his work.

09:16.857 --> 09:22.127
He often visited four
or five clients in an evening.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.797
Did your brother
use this car service?

09:25.799 --> 09:28.233
Yes. Miracle Limo.

09:28.235 --> 09:32.103
They're over on Tenth.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.106
...used to be I flip
through a couple of pages,

09:35.108 --> 09:36.341
takes two seconds.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.910
Now you got to boot
the damn machine--

09:38.912 --> 09:40.812
whatever the hell that is.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.614
Here you go--
Shore Diamonds.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.317
Yesterday, pickup 9:15 p.m.,
26 West 47th.

09:45.319 --> 09:46.651
And you dropped him?

09:46.653 --> 09:47.752
21St and Seventh.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.621
That's a lot
of real estate.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.590
You got anything
more specific?

09:51.592 --> 09:54.326
You're lucky
I got the machine turned on.

09:54.328 --> 09:55.594
Yeah, we're lucky.

09:59.333 --> 10:02.167
Ezra got here
at the earliest at 8:30.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.769
So it has to be somebody
who works late.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.338
Let's see what we got.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.341
Interior design firm,
temp employment agency...

10:09.343 --> 10:11.276
There's a lot of doctors.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.679
Bringing ten G's worth
of diamonds to a checkup?
I don't think so.

10:14.681 --> 10:15.614
An accountant?

10:15.616 --> 10:16.381
Flanagan.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.682
Here we go. Nah.

10:17.684 --> 10:20.652
Summers Estate Sales,
seventh floor.

10:20.654 --> 10:25.657
CERRETA:
Top floor, Near East Gems,
Joe Tashjian, President.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.691
Oh, my God.

10:26.693 --> 10:27.826
He was a nice man.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.694
I should call
on the family.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.262
Yesterday, Mr. Tashjian

10:31.264 --> 10:33.698
did you have a meeting
with Ezra Shore?

10:33.700 --> 10:35.634
A meeting? No.
A battle, yes.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.335
You don't talk
to Ezra Shore.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.370
You butt heads.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.639
He showed up
quarter to 10:00.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.307
Haggled for maybe two hours.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.175
So you bought
his diamonds?

10:44.177 --> 10:45.243
I'm an importer.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.245
I buy abroad;
I sell domestic.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.848
Ezra bought sapphires
and rubies from me.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.650
Bargained me down
to 15 G's.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.685
And he left here with them?

10:53.687 --> 10:54.719
Sure.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.364
You want a copy?

11:06.366 --> 11:07.699
Maybe.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.300
Did Ezra say

11:09.302 --> 11:11.670
where he was heading
when he left?

11:11.672 --> 11:14.806
Tried his car service,
but he couldn't get through.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.307
Said he'd hail a cab.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.910
The jewels--
they weren't on the body?

11:18.912 --> 11:21.413
I don't want
to be crude or anything,

11:21.415 --> 11:23.948
but the sapphires
and the rubies--

11:23.950 --> 11:25.884
they weren't paid for yet.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.385
$10,000 in diamonds

11:27.387 --> 11:29.754
another 15
in sapphires and rubies

11:29.756 --> 11:31.956
and this guy
travels unprotected?

11:31.958 --> 11:34.392
Would you prefer
he carry a piece?

11:34.394 --> 11:36.828
I'd prefer he travel
by armored car.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.329
Wouldn't have mattered.

11:38.331 --> 11:41.433
You rob someone,
you take the money and run.

11:41.435 --> 11:45.036
You don't hang out
for a beating and a barbecue.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.772
My call is they
were after Ezra.

11:47.774 --> 11:49.908
The diamonds were gravy.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.276
Whatever.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.777
They took the jewels.

11:52.779 --> 11:55.814
We find the jewels,
we find our guys.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.452
Got some lines out
on the local pawns.

12:00.454 --> 12:03.221
13 wedding rings,
half a dozen watches,

12:03.223 --> 12:04.422
some gold earrings.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.926
No sapphires, no rubies,
no unmounted diamonds.

12:07.928 --> 12:11.396
Did Ezra Shore have a kid
named Caleb?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.731
Yeah. Why?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.432
He's in holding.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.969
Seems he did a number
on some homeboy's face.

12:19.740 --> 12:23.408
LOGAN:
It says here you went after
one Reginald Beggs.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.944
Black, 15 years old.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.979
What happened, Caleb, hmm?

12:27.981 --> 12:31.850
Was this one of the kids
who bothered you before?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.420
Yeah, sure.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.892
Problem is, two witnesses say
you were all over him.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.495
No provocation, nothing.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.499
Caleb,

12:47.501 --> 12:50.301
all you have to do is
tell us the truth

12:50.303 --> 12:51.936
and we can help you out.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.305
It's as simple
as that.

12:55.509 --> 12:58.910
You can't beat
on every black kid in the city.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.378
What do you want?

13:00.380 --> 13:01.880
The guy killed Dad.

13:03.550 --> 13:04.516
He told you this?

13:04.518 --> 13:06.785
It's all over
the neighborhood.

13:06.787 --> 13:10.288
Those guys laughed
about Dad dying in an alley.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.390
Laughing doesn't mean
he killed him.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.993
The son of a bitch said
he liked burning him.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.394
He said I was next.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.329
What do you want me to do?

13:25.472 --> 13:26.504
You hassling me

13:26.506 --> 13:28.840
and it's my face
that's busted.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.108
You're an angel.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.543
You got that.
Caleb Shore says

13:31.545 --> 13:34.212
you did the number
on his old man.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.214
So I must be lying?

13:36.216 --> 13:39.517
The guy's going to pop you
for no reason?

13:39.519 --> 13:42.020
You look at them guys?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.288
They look normal to you?

13:43.290 --> 13:46.224
Like I said,
I was just hanging,

13:46.226 --> 13:48.526
then my head's
being smashed in.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.362
Tuesday morning--
who were you with?

13:51.364 --> 13:54.532
I was here with my sister,
studying.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.535
I'm going to be a lawyer.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.104
Some picture, Reg.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.207
You had a nice smile.

14:02.209 --> 14:05.210
Yeah, before
he busted up my face.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.411
Do you mind?

14:06.413 --> 14:08.479
I got a choice?

14:10.050 --> 14:13.351
OFFICER:
<i> Used to be to stay alive,</i>

14:13.353 --> 14:15.353
you stayed below 86th Street.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.324
Nowadays, somebody's just
looking to step into something.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.227
This one of the kids
you saw that day?

14:22.229 --> 14:26.898
We weren't really looking.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.066
What about clothes?

14:28.068 --> 14:29.067
Anything?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.168
They were running.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.269
Sorry.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.271
on 93rd...
That deli

14:33.273 --> 14:35.540
guys like to hang there.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.142
They don't bother me,
my customers.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.177
I let them hang.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.178
Mm-hmm.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.546
Is this one of them?

14:41.548 --> 14:42.881
Two packs a day.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.183
Tries to get me
to sell him beer.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.417
The day of the murder?

14:46.419 --> 14:47.452
Couldn't say.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.187
You believe
that stuff?

14:49.189 --> 14:50.321
We can be convinced.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.422
It's talk.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.158
All these kids
are looking for juice.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.427
Did you hear Reggie
admit to it?

14:56.429 --> 14:58.563
Yeah, that
and 25 other things.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.265
Thanks a lot.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.238
Well, it corroborates
Caleb's story.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.107
It might just be talk.

15:09.109 --> 15:12.343
At least we know Reggie
hangs in the neighborhood.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.480
We got nothing to put him
in that alleyway.

15:15.482 --> 15:16.614
Maybe we do.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.617
What size shoe
do you think Reggie wears?

15:19.619 --> 15:22.186
Let's talk to the man
about a warrant.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.621
You can't be serious, man.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.357
Yo, you can't take
my Michaels, man.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.959
Just the left one.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.360
I got rights, man.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.362
And we got a warrant.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.364
So, give us
the shoe now,

15:33.366 --> 15:34.632
or you come downtown,

15:34.634 --> 15:36.968
we run it through
some tests,

15:36.970 --> 15:38.703
and you're out of there.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.505
With my shoe?

15:40.507 --> 15:41.940
Depends what we find.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.408
You see this here?

15:43.410 --> 15:47.178
It's kind of blurry,
lighter than over here.

15:47.180 --> 15:49.647
Whoever wears this shoe

15:49.649 --> 15:51.683
over-pronates
when he walks.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.685
It's worn away, uneven.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.553
Similar wear patterns here.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.256
Unfortunately,
they're not fingerprints.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.258
What's this?

16:00.260 --> 16:03.995
Running shoes tend to pick up
more pebbles, glass, et cetera.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.964
Now, is it possible

16:05.966 --> 16:09.968
these two prints are
from the same shoe? Yes.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.236
Is it probable?
I'm not sure.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.405
Which means I wouldn't be
a very good witness.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.474
Reggie doesn't know that.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.543
Can I borrow these two?

16:18.545 --> 16:22.347
Y'all only doing this
because I'm black, man.

16:23.016 --> 16:26.250
This one was lifted
out of the alley

16:26.252 --> 16:29.020
the day that Ezra Shore
was murdered, Reggie.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.356
So, what you want me to do?

16:31.358 --> 16:33.224
To look at this one.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.360
It's from your shoe.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.763
They're the same.

16:38.765 --> 16:41.199
It proves you were
in the alley

16:41.201 --> 16:43.301
at the time
of the murder.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.403
Man, go 'head with that.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.673
We have two people who swear
you were bragging about it.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.309
So? That don't prove nothing.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.311
It proves
you stepped in something

16:53.313 --> 16:54.445
and it stinks

16:54.447 --> 16:56.447
and it's not going away.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.783
You killed him for the jewels?

16:58.785 --> 17:00.051
Or 'cause he was Jewish?

17:00.053 --> 17:02.420
I ain't do anything, man.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.222
You know what, Reggie?

17:04.224 --> 17:06.524
I personally
don't believe you.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.526
Yo, talk to the deli guy.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.029
I was in there
buying cigarettes.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.631
I ain't know
what was going down.

17:17.070 --> 17:20.071
Who was it, Reggie?

17:20.073 --> 17:24.609
I am talking to you.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.248
Fontaine, man.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.750
Yo... crazy, man.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.353
And Cyrus and Harley.

17:35.355 --> 17:39.690
I came out the store,
they was lighting him on fire.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.326
And beating the living crap
out of him?

17:42.328 --> 17:46.764
What was it,
baseball bats?

17:46.766 --> 17:49.267
Bricks?

17:49.269 --> 17:50.668
How did it feel

17:50.670 --> 17:51.803
to crush his skull?

17:51.805 --> 17:53.771
Yo, that's bull, man.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.474
The hell with this punk.

17:56.476 --> 17:58.709
25 Years
is too short for him.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.512
All right, yo, look... yeah

18:01.514 --> 18:03.648
but I just watched, man.

18:03.650 --> 18:06.784
I swear, I didn't have nothing
against that dude.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.386
And Fontaine did?

18:11.391 --> 18:12.757
Yeah.

18:12.759 --> 18:17.095
Says they should go back
where they came from.

18:17.097 --> 18:18.796
CRAGEN:
<i> Wait a minute here.</i>

18:18.798 --> 18:21.566
He says his buddies
did the number on Ezra

18:21.568 --> 18:24.435
and we already know
there's no blood there?

18:24.437 --> 18:27.338
His story may not get 100%
on the stink test

18:27.340 --> 18:29.507
but it's a start.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.675
I've had month-old flounder
that smelled better.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.412
He knew the M.O.,
The beating, the fire.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.414
Maybe he reads
the newspapers.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.716
Granted, his facts
are a little off,

18:38.718 --> 18:42.386
but the bottom line is,
he says he saw it go down.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.490
Two uniforms saw four kids
running from the scene.

18:45.492 --> 18:46.858
Reggie named three names.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.660
If he's innocent,
he keeps his mouth shut.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.896
Sure, sitting
in an interrogation room

18:51.898 --> 18:53.397
without his shoes.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.399
You check out these homeboys?

18:55.401 --> 18:57.168
Yeah, they're clean.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.469
What about the diamonds?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.505
He never saw
the briefcase.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.706
That could be his buddies.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.774
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

19:03.776 --> 19:05.576
Cragen.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.512
Yeah.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.380
Mm-hmm.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.848
All right.

19:10.850 --> 19:11.916
3:00.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.651
Okay.

19:13.653 --> 19:18.189
Everybody wants
to join the party now.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.393
got a witness,
Yes, we've

19:22.395 --> 19:25.696
only his facts don't jive
with our forensics report.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.398
How far off base
is he?

19:27.400 --> 19:28.866
With the beating
that Ezra took,

19:28.868 --> 19:31.802
there should have been
blood splattered somewhere

19:31.804 --> 19:33.571
and we found nothing.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.840
Which means he wasn't
killed in the alley.

19:35.842 --> 19:36.941
Except Mr. Beggs said

19:36.943 --> 19:38.910
he saw the guys
do the job there.

19:38.912 --> 19:43.814
Suppose the blood was on garbage
that was destroyed in the fire.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.484
He could be telling the truth.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.753
Well, we've applied
for warrants.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.523
Maybe we'll find the briefcase
or the jewels.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.626
Look, this is not
the only dance on my card.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.895
Typical case, your office
wouldn't even be involved yet.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.431
It's not a typical case.

20:00.433 --> 20:04.468
Ben, I want you to present this
to a grand jury.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.571
There's no way we convict.

20:06.573 --> 20:07.838
Even a mediocre lawyer
gets this tossed.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.941
I'm not talking
about a conviction.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.909
I'm talking about an indictment.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.211
We get a bill...

20:13.213 --> 20:15.646
it looks like
we're doing something.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.482
Politics controlling
the grand jury process?

20:18.484 --> 20:19.984
This is a political office.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.919
Kid says he's an eyewitness.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.888
We can put him at the scene.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.923
This isn't the first time
we indict

20:25.925 --> 20:28.459
and then develop
our case for trial.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.928
You got the names
of these other kids?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.663
Yeah.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.266
Read them their rights.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.610
What's up?

20:45.612 --> 20:46.877
Fontaine Robinson,

20:46.879 --> 20:48.813
Cyrus Tanner,
Harley Monks,

20:48.815 --> 20:51.916
you're under arrest
for the murder of Ezra Shore.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.484
That's harassment!

20:53.486 --> 20:55.720
You have the right
to an attorney.

20:55.722 --> 20:59.557
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.892
You have the right
to remain silent.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.895
Anything you do say
can be used against you
in a court of law.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.030
Take them away.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.469
COURT CLERK:
Docket number 776761--

21:11.471 --> 21:15.773
<i> People</i> v.<i> Fontaine Robinson,</i>
<i>Cyrus Tanner, and Harley Monks.</i>

21:15.775 --> 21:19.377
One count each,
murder in the second degree

21:19.379 --> 21:23.347
and one count each,
robbery in the first degree.

21:23.349 --> 21:24.782
JUDGE:
Is legal aid

21:24.784 --> 21:27.585
representing these defendants
just for arraignment?

21:27.587 --> 21:29.754
I'm in it
for the long haul.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.589
Well, give me a plea.

21:31.591 --> 21:32.790
Not guilty.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.660
The people are serving
grand jury notice

21:35.662 --> 21:36.727
upon the defense

21:36.729 --> 21:38.863
and filing the same
with the court.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.666
What do I hear on bail?

21:41.668 --> 21:43.734
100,000 on each defendant.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.636
They're teenagers.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.871
It's excessive.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.839
Would it make a difference

21:48.841 --> 21:51.842
if the state asked for $50,000,
Miss Langstrom?

21:51.844 --> 21:55.012
Bail set at $100,000.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.847
Next.

21:56.849 --> 22:00.017
Only thing this proves
is Reggie Beggs and his Hi-Tops

22:00.019 --> 22:02.787
were in the alley
at some point.

22:02.789 --> 22:04.889
Reggie put your boys
with him.

22:04.891 --> 22:07.024
That makes him an accomplice--

22:07.026 --> 22:09.694
meaning you're short
on corroboration.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.430
The blood under
the victim's fingernail

22:12.432 --> 22:13.798
matches Harley Monks.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.567
It matches me and a million
others in Manhattan.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.769
You searched
my clients' homes.

22:18.771 --> 22:21.639
You ran their clothing
through the lab.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.442
No baseball bats,
no blood tracks...

22:24.444 --> 22:26.544
all show and no tell.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.646
The grand jury will indict.

22:28.648 --> 22:29.780
And I'll have it dismissed

22:29.782 --> 22:31.649
before your head
hits the pillow.

22:31.651 --> 22:32.750
With an eyewitness?
I doubt it.

22:32.752 --> 22:34.752
Reggie Beggs went bragging

22:34.754 --> 22:37.655
that your clients
killed Ezra Shore.

22:37.657 --> 22:39.890
And posturing
constitutes evidence?

22:39.892 --> 22:43.060
You think I don't know
what you're up to?

22:43.062 --> 22:46.831
You and Schiff can put on
your happy faces for the press.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.432
But I'm telling you now,

22:48.434 --> 22:50.434
you go the distance
on this

22:50.436 --> 22:52.703
you can expect
a civil rights suit

22:52.705 --> 22:54.438
against the city.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.707
Do you get the feeling

22:56.709 --> 22:59.744
we're scrambling
to catch a train here?

22:59.746 --> 23:02.513
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

23:02.515 --> 23:03.881
Hello?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.883
Uh-huh.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.818
What's up?

23:07.820 --> 23:09.854
(<i> sighs</i> )

23:09.856 --> 23:11.722
All right.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.724
Isaac Shore and his lawyer.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.994
They want to meet with us
before the grand jury.

23:16.996 --> 23:19.830
Now you come to us?
The grand jury starts
in 15 minutes.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.733
Ezra was my brother.
Believe me, I want to help,

23:22.735 --> 23:24.802
but I have to visit my rabbi
before I do anything.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.804
It's a matter
of Talmudic law.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.572
There may be
a prohibition

23:28.574 --> 23:30.875
against incriminating
family members.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.110
Isaac, we've got three teenagers

23:33.112 --> 23:35.713
suspected
of killing your brother.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.815
How in the world
do you expect...?

23:37.817 --> 23:40.618
They were also charged
with robbery.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.853
You're going to ask
Isaac about the diamonds

23:42.855 --> 23:44.755
Ezra was carrying?

23:44.757 --> 23:47.491
Of course, but what does that
have to do

23:47.493 --> 23:49.493
with your client's family?

23:49.495 --> 23:51.729
<i> If</i> all required duties
weren't paid

23:51.731 --> 23:54.098
when those diamonds
entered the country,

23:54.100 --> 23:56.634
Mr. Shore's heirs
could be liable

23:56.636 --> 23:58.035
for substantial fines.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.504
Give me a couple of days.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.573
We'll check with the rabbi.

24:02.575 --> 24:03.874
It's probably much ado.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.576
He's scheduled
a second witness.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.545
He's been subpoenaed
and if he doesn't testify,

24:07.547 --> 24:10.514
you know I can hold him
for contempt.

24:10.516 --> 24:13.717
I also know you're not going
to do that, Ben.

24:13.719 --> 24:16.687
ROBINETTE:
We could grant the family

24:16.689 --> 24:18.088
transactional immunity.

24:18.090 --> 24:20.925
That's possible, but...

24:20.927 --> 24:22.693
Whatever you say
on the stand,

24:22.695 --> 24:25.029
no matter how much
you incriminate them,

24:25.031 --> 24:26.897
they can't be charged.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.900
So even if the Talmud
prohibits it...

24:29.902 --> 24:32.770
You're perfectly
in the clear.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.706
Only tell me, Ben,
are you going

24:35.708 --> 24:37.808
to put Caleb
on the stand?

24:37.810 --> 24:39.777
All right, fine.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.812
They both have immunity.

24:41.814 --> 24:45.783
TASHJIAN:
It was two hours before
we settled on a price: $15,000.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.085
How many stones
were there exactly?

24:48.087 --> 24:50.821
TASHJIAN:
Three sapphires, one carat each.

24:50.823 --> 24:54.558
The rubies were small,
half carat, maybe four stones.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.794
What did Mr. Shore do with them?

24:56.796 --> 24:58.896
He put them in his briefcase.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.831
And then what did he do?

25:00.833 --> 25:02.733
He left.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.803
I assume he was going home
to his family.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.805
ISAAC:
<i> I know from the ledger</i>

25:07.807 --> 25:10.107
Ezra signed out lot 492.

25:10.109 --> 25:14.745
What was the value
of the diamonds in lot 492?

25:14.747 --> 25:17.848
Retail, maybe $10,000.

25:17.850 --> 25:21.151
Did your brother often take
diamonds from the store?

25:21.153 --> 25:26.090
If he had business that evening
or early the next morning, yes.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.826
Mr. Shore, do you have any idea

25:28.828 --> 25:31.629
who might have killed
your brother?

25:31.631 --> 25:35.165
Well, I know he...

25:35.167 --> 25:38.802
Ezra had problems
in the neighborhood.

25:38.804 --> 25:42.773
Thank you.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.875
It was Dad, Benny, and me.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.011
We got to the park on 100th.

25:47.013 --> 25:48.979
We used to cut through,

25:48.981 --> 25:51.849
but since the black kids
started hassling us,

25:51.851 --> 25:53.684
we go around.

25:53.686 --> 25:56.720
What happened
on that particular day?

25:56.722 --> 26:00.724
Four guys were hanging there,
the same guys as before.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.027
They called us names--
yid, kike.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.029
STONE:
Then what happened?

26:05.031 --> 26:07.865
CALEB:
Dad yelled at them and he said

26:07.867 --> 26:11.135
that he'd kick their butts
if they didn't lay off.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.837
BEGGS:
I was on Amsterdam near 93rd.

26:13.839 --> 26:16.974
I went to this deli
to buy a pack of cigarettes.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.209
Then what did you do, Mr. Beggs?

26:19.211 --> 26:21.845
I went outside
to look for my friends.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.681
What were they doing?

26:23.683 --> 26:25.249
They was
in the alley.

26:25.251 --> 26:27.885
They was standing
over Mr. Shore.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.154
Cyrus threw garbage on him.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.723
Fontaine lit him on fire.

26:32.725 --> 26:34.024
Let's back up a step.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.759
You left the deli.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.194
You went to the alley.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.897
What was the first thing
you saw?

26:39.899 --> 26:43.901
Like I told you,
they lit him on fire.

26:43.903 --> 26:48.272
Mr. Beggs, you testified
under oath to the police

26:48.274 --> 26:52.710
that you saw your friends
beat Mr. Shore

26:52.712 --> 26:55.012
and<i> then</i> set him on fire.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.814
I was scared, man.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.782
I didn't know what to do.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.885
Young man,
are you now telling me

27:01.887 --> 27:03.887
that that was a lie?

27:03.889 --> 27:09.326
Look, I had to tell them
something.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.328
I seen Fontaine
start the fire.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.063
That's it.

27:13.065 --> 27:16.800
That man was already dead
when I got there.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.770
But you also told Caleb Shore

27:19.772 --> 27:23.073
that your friends
killed his father.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.776
That was just air, man.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.745
You just made this up?

27:27.747 --> 27:29.747
It's like...

27:29.749 --> 27:31.782
I was just trying...

27:31.784 --> 27:34.151
It's about getting juice.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.021
Like people think
you wasted a man,

27:37.023 --> 27:39.289
they step aside
when you walk by.

27:39.291 --> 27:42.326
Do you know what perjury is,
Mr. Beggs?

27:42.328 --> 27:45.062
I'm sorry we lit him up.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.064
I'm sorry I lied.

27:47.066 --> 27:50.968
You don't believe me,
that's up to you.

27:50.970 --> 27:54.004
Our witness changes his story
on the stand.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.240
I had to withdraw
the murder case.

27:56.242 --> 27:59.877
You hit a bad lie,
you don't walk off the course.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.879
There's no way the grand jury
would indict

28:01.881 --> 28:03.781
even if I finished presenting,
they'd no bill the kid.

28:03.783 --> 28:05.315
Then what?

28:05.317 --> 28:08.786
Then we wouldn't have
some op-ed wannabe

28:08.788 --> 28:11.121
write that we're
choosing sides.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.257
Oh, great. Two weeks ago,

28:13.259 --> 28:15.192
we were patsies
to the Jewish lobby.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.994
Now it's the black caucus.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.295
30 years ago, blacks and Jews

28:18.297 --> 28:19.930
were marching together
in Selma, Alabama.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.199
Now it's every man
for himself.

28:22.201 --> 28:26.136
You're named as respondent in
this Writ of Mandamus petition.

28:26.138 --> 28:28.872
Forced us to re-present
the case to the grand jury.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.774
Who filed it?
Isaac Shore.

28:30.776 --> 28:33.010
He wants us to release
the grand jury transcripts.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.945
He's angry. He wants justice.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.413
Talk him out of it.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.348
There was no conspiracy,
no gentlemen's agreement.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.917
The case simply fell through.

28:39.919 --> 28:42.086
My brother
was beaten and burned.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.288
The police have the boys
that did it.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.824
<i> You</i> let them go.
What should I think?

28:46.826 --> 28:48.225
That we didn't have
enough evidence.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.027
That we relied
on the wrong witness.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.895
Then Ezra was
the wrong victim.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.832
it's obviously a whitewash.
Come on, Ben,

28:54.834 --> 28:57.801
Their leaders screamed louder
than ours.

28:57.803 --> 28:59.269
The case mysteriously
disappears.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.905
If and when we get new evidence,

29:01.907 --> 29:04.341
we will resubmit
to the grand jury.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.376
Two days later, you withdraw.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.879
STONE:
What's your implication?

29:08.881 --> 29:10.180
It's no implication, Ben.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.882
It's an assertion.

29:11.884 --> 29:15.219
If you wanted an indictment,
you could have gotten one.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.854
That's nonsense.

29:16.856 --> 29:19.123
Then turn over
those transcripts.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.258
Grand jury proceedings
are secret.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.428
Then we'll proceed
with the Writ of Mandamus.

29:24.430 --> 29:28.298
The decision to resubmit is
entirely within my discretion.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.869
There's statutory prohibition
against releasing transcripts.

29:31.871 --> 29:34.872
Not if I can prove to the judge

29:34.874 --> 29:37.841
there was
prosecutorial misconduct.

29:37.843 --> 29:39.877
ISAAC:
These boys
killed my brother.

29:39.879 --> 29:45.015
I will not turn the other cheek,
Mr. Stone.

29:45.017 --> 29:49.153
Well, I'll make
the transcripts available.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.155
Thank you.

29:51.157 --> 29:54.224
I'll send over a messenger.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.927
You'll see them
in my office, Mr. Shore.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.863
TOBIS:
Mr. Shore has
two families to feed.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.499
We're talking almost
a day's worth of reading.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.368
Who's it going to hurt?

30:04.370 --> 30:07.905
I'll bend the rules
for your client, Mr. Tobis.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.273
I won't break them.

30:09.275 --> 30:11.408
You want to read
those transcripts,

30:11.410 --> 30:13.410
come to 1 Hogan Place.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.246
ROBINETTE:
<i> If the case is withdrawn</i>
<i> from the grand jury,</i>

30:16.248 --> 30:18.515
Isaac's got
a legitimate gripe.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.285
Reading the transcripts
is the only way

30:21.287 --> 30:24.288
to convince himself
nothing funny went down.

30:24.290 --> 30:27.891
Exactly, so it shouldn't matter
where he reads them.

30:27.893 --> 30:29.426
Unless someone else

30:29.428 --> 30:31.929
wants to see
the transcripts.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.163
The real killers.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.531
Could be this case
has nothing to do with race.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.266
Diamonds, money.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.902
Greed is always
a good place to start.

30:38.904 --> 30:40.971
Let's take a look
at the grieving brother.

30:40.973 --> 30:43.407
The past three months,
cash flow reports

30:43.409 --> 30:45.142
show the Shore Jewelry

30:45.144 --> 30:47.477
bought over $3 million
worth of diamonds.

30:47.479 --> 30:49.479
Not bad in a recession.

30:49.481 --> 30:52.115
Only during the same period,

30:52.117 --> 30:54.117
they only carried
2.2 million in insurance.

30:54.119 --> 30:56.520
What's that have
to do with Isaac?

30:56.521 --> 30:58.922
What, they bought more diamonds
than they insured?

30:58.924 --> 31:00.557
$900,000 more.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.559
Who prepared
the insurance lists?

31:02.561 --> 31:04.294
Isaac.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.280
He did the books.

31:06.281 --> 31:08.265
Could be Isaac skimmed
from the business,

31:08.267 --> 31:10.434
buying jewels
for his own account.

31:10.436 --> 31:12.102
And Ezra found out...

31:12.104 --> 31:14.171
Isaac killing his own brother...

31:14.173 --> 31:16.039
I don't know if I buy that.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.442
Maybe he's not in this alone.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.944
Hmm, could be.

31:20.946 --> 31:23.080
The discrepancies are too big
to be overlooked.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.183
ISAAC:
The diamond market
is very complicated.

31:26.185 --> 31:28.452
Inventory is tied
to real market value.

31:28.454 --> 31:31.355
ROBINETTE:
You undervalued your inventory

31:31.357 --> 31:33.590
for the purposes of insurance?

31:33.592 --> 31:36.426
If that's what
he says he did.

31:36.428 --> 31:39.196
I think he stole money
from his brother.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.598
You think Isaac
killed his brother?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.600
ROBINETTE:
He had motive and opportunity.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.435
We can make a case.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.604
STONE:
All the evidence points to you.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.573
You didn't do it alone.

31:49.575 --> 31:53.577
So speak up and maybe
we can work something out.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.579
Nice try.

31:55.581 --> 31:58.615
Come on, Isaac.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.584
Mike, wait.

32:00.586 --> 32:07.357
I'd like to talk
to my attorney in private.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.312
Almost 20 minutes.

32:28.314 --> 32:31.181
You think Tobis
will let him talk or what?

32:31.183 --> 32:33.050
25 Years in Attica...

32:33.052 --> 32:35.585
I think
he'll cough up a name.

32:35.587 --> 32:39.256
His lawyer is just
plugging up the loopholes.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.465
I want to say this
for the record.

32:48.467 --> 32:52.669
My client still has immunity
deriving from his appearance

32:52.671 --> 32:55.138
before the grand jury.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.241
Whatever he says,
you can't touch him.

33:01.246 --> 33:03.613
I'm the one, Mr. Stone.

33:03.615 --> 33:05.515
I killed Ezra.

33:05.517 --> 33:07.284
I did it alone.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.653
Uh, Mr. Shore,
this is a mistake.

33:09.655 --> 33:12.155
You're protecting someone.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.523
Why?

33:13.525 --> 33:16.560
Believe whatever you want.

33:16.562 --> 33:19.096
That's what happened.

33:24.770 --> 33:27.337
We gave him immunity because
he didn't want to testify
about the business.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.484
We never mentioned
murder.

33:29.485 --> 33:31.630
The statute covers
everything he talks
about on the stand.

33:31.631 --> 33:33.776
We gave him immunity as quid pro
quo for his testimony; he lied.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.345
That breaks the deal--
common sense.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.348
Common sense has nothing
to do with it.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.650
Man waives
his Fifth Amendment rights

33:40.652 --> 33:41.718
by testifying.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.454
Whether he tells the truth
or not.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.289
It doesn't matter.
He's entitled to immunity.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.258
You think
he killed his brother?

33:48.260 --> 33:50.360
No, I think
he's protecting someone.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.329
Uh-huh.

33:52.331 --> 33:54.664
Then we threaten him
with perjury.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.267
The idea of four years in Attica

33:57.269 --> 33:59.770
should scare the hell out
of him. He'll talk.

33:59.772 --> 34:03.273
The alternative
might scare him more.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.775
The man's scared.

34:04.777 --> 34:07.444
He saw what happened
to his brother.

34:07.446 --> 34:11.248
Man is desperate enough
to steal from his own family.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.316
Subpoena his personal records

34:13.318 --> 34:15.786
and find out
who he owes money to.

34:15.788 --> 34:18.155
Banks kill
with a thousand cuts

34:18.157 --> 34:19.389
not with a whack.

34:19.391 --> 34:21.425
Some lenders
are in a bigger hurry.

34:21.427 --> 34:24.094
Ezra dies,
Isaac gets the business.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.730
It's a good way
to insure prompt payment.

34:35.240 --> 34:37.240
His bank statements look clean.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.243
No evidence of regular payments
to anyone.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.745
No withdrawals.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.246
Sure it's<i> not</i> about money?

34:43.248 --> 34:44.781
I didn't say that.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.716
Remember those diamonds
Isaac bought but never insured?

34:46.718 --> 34:49.219
They're all purchased
from Joseph Tashjian.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.121
$300,000 worth
of sapphires

34:51.123 --> 34:53.290
and rubies each month.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.291
A month later,

34:54.293 --> 34:56.827
they were sold back to Tashjian

34:56.829 --> 34:59.029
at a $10,000 mark-up.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.230
And you don't think Tashjian
is stupid about money?

35:01.233 --> 35:03.333
I don't think
the diamonds exist.

35:03.335 --> 35:04.868
It's smoke and mirrors

35:04.870 --> 35:07.571
with real money
shuffling back and forth.

35:07.573 --> 35:08.805
So it's a laundry.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.774
Dirty money in.
Clean money out.

35:10.776 --> 35:14.144
With phoney receipts to make it
all look kosher.

35:14.146 --> 35:16.546
They're laundering
over $4 million a year.

35:16.548 --> 35:19.449
The Shore brothers get $10,000
off every resale?

35:19.451 --> 35:22.219
Their fee for laundering
Tashjian's money.

35:22.221 --> 35:24.421
Tashjian's was the last place
Ezra went.

35:24.423 --> 35:26.256
I'll get a warrant.

35:28.861 --> 35:32.329
Half an hour, my lawyer
will have your butts out.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.764
Your butt's going to be
in a patrol car

35:34.766 --> 35:36.399
if you don't shut up!

35:36.401 --> 35:38.869
Phil...

35:38.871 --> 35:40.570
you want a Rolex?

35:40.572 --> 35:42.873
Maybe a Cartier
for the missus?

35:42.875 --> 35:45.575
Looks like, feels like,
sounds like.

35:45.577 --> 35:48.178
A warehouse
full of felonies.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.479
(<i> speaking Armenian</i> )

35:51.850 --> 35:54.618
Mr. Tashjian produced
counterfeit goods

35:54.620 --> 35:56.520
without the benefit
of a license

35:56.522 --> 35:57.921
from the copyright holder.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.322
He smuggled them
into the country.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.491
It has nothing to do
with my client.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.492
It does

36:02.494 --> 36:04.194
under federal
conspiracy laws.

36:04.196 --> 36:07.364
Laundering profits
from an illegal enterprise.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.398
That's tax fraud
and racketeering.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.367
You gave me immunity.

36:10.369 --> 36:11.801
State, not federal.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.237
You don't have a patch of ground

36:14.239 --> 36:15.572
to stand on,
Mr. Shore.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.440
We know
Joseph Tashjian

36:17.442 --> 36:19.442
killed your brother.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.378
You don't realize my family...

36:21.380 --> 36:22.512
Mr. Shore,

36:22.514 --> 36:24.281
what you don't realize

36:24.283 --> 36:27.350
is, we are talking
about racketeering charges.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.452
You will forfeit
all the proceeds

36:29.454 --> 36:31.454
from your illegal activities.
That's everything, sir.

36:31.456 --> 36:34.391
Cars, homes, cash...

36:34.393 --> 36:36.426
Ben, you'll never be able
to prove

36:36.428 --> 36:38.862
which assets were bought
with bad money.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.598
The burden of proof
is on your client.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.901
We will strip your family bare.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.648
Ezra took me into the business.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.418
He paid me as much as he could.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.652
I don't blame him.

37:02.654 --> 37:06.289
But it wasn't enough
for my family.

37:06.291 --> 37:08.425
So when Joseph Tashjian

37:08.427 --> 37:10.560
asked me to help him
with his money,

37:10.562 --> 37:11.928
I thought,

37:11.930 --> 37:14.664
"Who could get hurt?"

37:14.666 --> 37:17.000
So your brother Ezra had no idea

37:17.002 --> 37:19.336
the business
was laundering money.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.872
Not for a whole year.

37:22.874 --> 37:25.575
He rarely looked at the books.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.344
He trusted me.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.312
STONE:
And what did he do
when he found out?

37:29.314 --> 37:31.448
SHORE:
He was furious that I would risk

37:31.450 --> 37:34.317
everything my father
had worked for.

37:34.319 --> 37:37.954
He demanded I stop
immediately.

37:37.956 --> 37:40.590
He just didn't understand.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.026
What didn't he understand?

37:43.028 --> 37:46.663
He didn't understand
I wanted to stop as well,

37:46.665 --> 37:49.332
but Tashjian
wouldn't let me out--

37:49.334 --> 37:54.304
that he had partners,
dangerous men.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.740
Ezra didn't care.

37:56.742 --> 37:59.409
He wanted to talk
to Tashjian himself.

37:59.411 --> 38:01.411
Well, I told him, "Please."

38:01.413 --> 38:03.980
I begged him.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.684
Around 9:00, he got a car

38:07.686 --> 38:10.654
and went over
to Tashjian's office anyway.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.623
STONE:
And what did you do?

38:16.428 --> 38:18.428
I followed him.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.399
Please tell the court
what happened

38:22.401 --> 38:24.034
at Joseph Tashjian's.

38:26.638 --> 38:30.307
Everything got out of hand.

38:30.309 --> 38:33.977
I tried to calm Joe down,
but he was...

38:33.979 --> 38:37.347
he was ranting like a crazy man.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.382
He blamed me.

38:39.384 --> 38:43.987
Said we were trying
to run him out of his business.

38:46.425 --> 38:50.493
Tashjian took a cane...

38:52.431 --> 38:54.964
He was acting like an animal,

38:54.966 --> 38:56.966
like a savage,

38:56.968 --> 38:59.602
again and again...

38:59.604 --> 39:01.604
bashing Ezra's head...

39:01.606 --> 39:06.409
his body.

39:06.411 --> 39:08.712
There was so much blood.

39:08.714 --> 39:12.515
And he just kept beating
and beating.

39:16.588 --> 39:18.655
And I just watched.

39:22.127 --> 39:25.628
He killed my brother
and I just watched.

39:31.570 --> 39:35.438
Mr. Shore, why didn't you
tell the police?

39:35.440 --> 39:36.706
I was scared.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.408
So scared

39:38.410 --> 39:40.610
you would have let
three innocent boys

39:40.612 --> 39:42.112
go to jail?

39:42.114 --> 39:46.416
I thought after a while
the charges would be dropped.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.451
STONE:
And when they were,

39:48.453 --> 39:50.587
then you confessed. Why?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.088
Because

39:52.090 --> 39:54.557
he said
he would hurt the family.

39:54.559 --> 39:57.460
He would kill my children,
Ezra's children.

39:57.462 --> 40:01.398
Mr. Stone,

40:01.400 --> 40:04.667
my family-- that's all I have.

40:10.742 --> 40:13.543
No more questions.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.750
Who owns Shore's Jewelry?

40:20.752 --> 40:22.419
Ezra.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.187
My father gave him the business.

40:24.189 --> 40:27.157
And how much did Ezra pay you?

40:27.159 --> 40:29.626
$60,000 a year.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.162
And how much did you earn
last year

40:32.164 --> 40:35.665
from Mr. Tashjian's
money-laundering operation?

40:35.667 --> 40:38.067
About 140,000.

40:38.069 --> 40:40.637
And your brother wanted
to take that away, huh?

40:42.641 --> 40:44.707
Must have made you mad.

40:46.778 --> 40:48.645
Mad enough to kill?

40:48.647 --> 40:49.846
Objection.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.181
Withdrawn.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.920
Mr. Shore,
you admitted

40:56.922 --> 40:58.755
lying to the police, right?

40:58.757 --> 41:00.190
Yeah.

41:00.192 --> 41:01.558
And to your attorney?

41:01.560 --> 41:03.092
Yes.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.127
To the district attorney?

41:04.129 --> 41:04.794
Yes.

41:04.796 --> 41:05.795
And you lied

41:05.797 --> 41:07.797
to the grand jury.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.533
To protect my family.

41:10.535 --> 41:13.937
What did you
expect me to do?

41:15.740 --> 41:17.106
Do you at all

41:17.108 --> 41:19.242
feel responsible
for your brother's death?

41:19.244 --> 41:23.813
It's possible.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.682
You confessed to his murder,
didn't you?

41:28.487 --> 41:31.921
If it weren't for you,
your brother would be alive.

41:31.923 --> 41:34.190
Isn't that correct, Mr. Shore?

41:35.594 --> 41:37.193
Yes!

41:46.571 --> 41:48.505
He was very compelling.
What more could they want?

41:48.507 --> 41:50.640
If the jury doesn't believe
your eyewitness,

41:50.642 --> 41:52.208
it's all worthless.

41:52.210 --> 41:55.512
They will understand
Isaac's motive for lying.

41:55.514 --> 41:58.615
They'll see he was scared.
Empathy goes a long way.

41:58.617 --> 42:00.884
And they'll also see

42:00.885 --> 42:03.152
he neatly avoided forfeiting
all his assets under<i> Rico</i>

42:03.154 --> 42:04.521
by testifying.

42:04.523 --> 42:06.189
You don't believe
I can win.

42:06.191 --> 42:09.292
I believe you got
a hell of a mountain to climb

42:09.294 --> 42:10.760
in your summation.

42:10.762 --> 42:12.629
Isaac's lack of credibility

42:12.631 --> 42:14.797
translates
into reasonable doubt.

42:14.799 --> 42:18.167
The jury could find Tashjian
technically not guilty.

42:18.169 --> 42:21.971
We all know he killed
Ezra Shore.

42:21.973 --> 42:25.241
Our knowledge is a long way
from proof.

42:30.882 --> 42:34.250
One witness--
that's all they have.

42:34.252 --> 42:37.020
The victim's brother.

42:37.022 --> 42:39.889
If you fully believe Isaac Shore

42:39.891 --> 42:42.592
is telling the truth,
convict him.

42:42.594 --> 42:44.260
Why not?

42:44.262 --> 42:47.263
Isaac Shore lied
to the grand jury,

42:47.265 --> 42:48.731
to his family.

42:48.733 --> 42:52.035
He lied to the police,
to the prosecutors.

42:52.037 --> 42:58.308
At one point, he confessed
to having killed him.

42:58.310 --> 43:02.845
Of course, he could be
telling the truth now.

43:02.847 --> 43:04.581
Sure, it's possible

43:04.583 --> 43:07.584
Joseph Tashjian
murdered Ezra Shore.

43:07.586 --> 43:10.053
You may even think it's
probable,

43:10.055 --> 43:11.721
but in that case,

43:11.723 --> 43:15.258
there's only one thing
you can do.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.926
Your duty is clear.

43:16.928 --> 43:19.262
You must return a verdict

43:19.264 --> 43:22.248
of not guilty

43:22.249 --> 43:25.233
because in this system,
"probably" is not good enough.

43:25.236 --> 43:27.337
You must be convinced

43:27.339 --> 43:31.674
beyond a reasonable doubt.

43:31.676 --> 43:34.711
Isaac Shore
has told so many lies

43:34.713 --> 43:39.983
that it would be unreasonable
not to doubt his testimony.

43:39.985 --> 43:42.685
Yes, Isaac Shore
should have come forward

43:42.687 --> 43:46.789
and said that, "Joseph Tashjian
savagely murdered my brother."

43:46.791 --> 43:50.093
And he should have stood up
in the grand jury and said,

43:50.095 --> 43:52.328
"Those three boys are innocent.

43:52.330 --> 43:54.297
Joseph Tashjian's the killer."

43:54.299 --> 43:55.965
But he didn't do that.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.635
Was he immoral?

43:58.637 --> 44:00.670
Was he evil?

44:00.672 --> 44:03.373
Isaac Shore was terrified.

44:03.375 --> 44:07.977
He'd eyewitnessed
an unspeakable horror--

44:07.979 --> 44:11.314
the brutalization
of a family member.

44:11.316 --> 44:16.886
And it was his greatest fear
to ever see that happen again.

44:16.888 --> 44:21.324
So why would Isaac Shore
concoct a story like this?

44:24.396 --> 44:26.396
The fears of Isaac Shore--

44:26.398 --> 44:29.999
they don't make his testimony
any the less credible

44:30.001 --> 44:33.102
and they certainly
don't make Joseph Tashjian

44:33.104 --> 44:34.871
any the less guilty.

44:34.873 --> 44:39.342
Joseph Tashjian is guilty
of murder in the second degree.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.422
On the sole count
of the indictment,

44:52.424 --> 44:54.857
murder in the second degree,

44:54.859 --> 44:56.993
how does the jury find?

44:59.097 --> 45:01.998
We find the defendant
not guilty.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.935
(<i> yelling</i> )

45:12.043 --> 45:13.776
Quiet in the court.

45:13.778 --> 45:15.478
(<i> yelling continues</i> )

45:30.061 --> 45:34.731
My father is convinced
everyone is motivated by fear.

45:34.733 --> 45:36.032
Mine thinks it's greed.

45:36.034 --> 45:37.734
What do you think?

45:37.736 --> 45:39.736
That Isaac fell victim
to both.

45:39.738 --> 45:41.104
(<i> gunshot</i> )

45:41.106 --> 45:42.872
(<i> woman screams</i> )

45:42.874 --> 45:44.173
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.
