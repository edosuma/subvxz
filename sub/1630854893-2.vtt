WEBVTT

00:00.664 --> 00:03.264
(upbeat music)

00:30.111 --> 00:32.111
But where do you live now?

00:32.791 --> 00:34.792
With the lost boys.

00:35.712 --> 00:37.172
Who are they?

00:37.272 --> 00:40.493
They are the children who fall
out of their perambulators

00:40.593 --> 00:42.594
when the nurse is looking the other way.

00:43.754 --> 00:46.635
And if they're not claimed in seven days,

00:47.635 --> 00:50.195
then they are sent far away,

00:54.356 --> 00:56.357
to Neverland.

00:57.037 --> 01:00.658
- Bed.
- Daddy?

01:00.758 --> 01:02.618
- Yeah?
- We're like lost boys,

01:02.718 --> 01:04.419
- aren't we?
- Why?

01:04.519 --> 01:05.699
Because you have lots of adventures.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.800
No, because we don't have a mummy.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.641
Daddy, do you have adventures?

01:13.681 --> 01:15.681
Erm, you guys,

01:19.762 --> 01:21.763
you guys are my big adventure.

01:23.563 --> 01:25.564
Night, babies.

01:26.284 --> 01:28.844
(gentle music)

01:49.129 --> 01:52.530
(gentle music continues)

02:05.813 --> 02:07.814
What are you thinking about?

02:09.534 --> 02:11.534
Today.

02:13.895 --> 02:16.216
- Do you want my advice?
- Yeah.

02:17.176 --> 02:20.877
Just get through it.

02:20.977 --> 02:22.977
Are you gonna have a drink today?

02:23.897 --> 02:27.418
No. If I start, I won't be able to stop.

02:30.219 --> 02:33.860
Okay. The other thing
I was gonna say was,

02:36.860 --> 02:38.861
- if you start to cry.
- I won't.

02:40.901 --> 02:42.902
- Why?
- Same reason.

02:48.143 --> 02:51.164
(baby crying)

02:51.264 --> 02:53.264
Is that yours or mine?

02:55.705 --> 02:57.785
- Mine.
- What time is it?

02:59.186 --> 03:02.546
(baby continues crying)

03:07.588 --> 03:09.588
Ten to five.

03:11.148 --> 03:14.149
Right, let's call that
morning then, shall we?

03:20.591 --> 03:23.191
(gentle music)

03:45.396 --> 03:49.637
- (baby cries)
- Shh, shh, it's okay.

03:50.718 --> 03:54.119
(gentle music continues)

04:05.881 --> 04:07.882
I knew Jess for three years,

04:13.083 --> 04:15.083
and I loved her.

04:17.564 --> 04:19.565
We had two children together

04:23.285 --> 04:25.286
and we were a family,

04:29.167 --> 04:31.167
for two days,

04:34.408 --> 04:36.408
and that's not fair.

04:39.729 --> 04:43.670
It's not fair on me and
it's not fair on her.

04:43.770 --> 04:45.971
But most importantly,
it's not fair on them.

04:48.251 --> 04:50.252
'Cause without Jess in our lives,

04:51.332 --> 04:54.313
no matter how much we, we
think we're missing out on,

04:54.413 --> 04:56.413
it's, it's nothing
compared to what they are

05:00.054 --> 05:02.054
because I can't love them for her.

05:03.975 --> 05:05.975
I can do this on my own

05:09.136 --> 05:12.497
and that might sound strange,
so, so let me clarify it.

05:19.499 --> 05:20.599
I can do this on my own

05:20.699 --> 05:24.020
because I have to,
because they need me to.

05:25.580 --> 05:27.580
It doesn't mean that I want to.

05:28.261 --> 05:31.421
- (baby crying)
- Sorry.

05:37.743 --> 05:39.743
So here's another promise.

05:41.464 --> 05:42.204
If you ever wake up

05:42.304 --> 05:46.505
and think, "I'd like
to see the twins today.

05:47.385 --> 05:49.246
I wonder if that's possible".

05:49.346 --> 05:51.626
Then know that the answer
will always be yes,

05:52.946 --> 05:54.947
because if we do that,

05:55.267 --> 05:57.207
if every time you want
to see them, then you do,

05:57.307 --> 05:59.648
if every time you want to
be with them, then you are,

05:59.748 --> 06:04.029
then maybe, maybe we
can love them for her.

06:17.232 --> 06:19.233
I think that's what Jess would've wanted.

06:22.433 --> 06:24.834
(soft music)

06:31.636 --> 06:33.836
They wanna know if they
can have a biscuit in bed.

06:35.236 --> 06:37.237
Didn't think so.

06:38.037 --> 06:39.337
You know, you don't have to
sleep on that every time.

06:39.437 --> 06:41.818
- I don't mind.
- Yeah, I know.

06:41.918 --> 06:42.678
But you also don't mind complaining

06:42.678 --> 06:44.759
about your back for all
the next day, do you?

06:49.640 --> 06:51.640
- Mum?
- What?

06:52.880 --> 06:56.461
- I don't want to go.
- Oh, bloody hell, Ben.

06:56.561 --> 06:58.562
You're meeting a mate, not.

06:59.562 --> 07:01.142
You can't spend the rest of your life sat

07:01.242 --> 07:01.943
in here with me.

07:02.043 --> 07:05.303
You need to go out and, I don't know.

07:05.403 --> 07:06.264
Go, go. Go on.

07:06.364 --> 07:08.364
- Go on.
- Okay.

07:10.205 --> 07:12.205
- See you later.
- Have fun.

07:13.805 --> 07:16.806
(upbeat club music)

07:24.488 --> 07:25.948
Hey, do you ever, erm,

07:26.048 --> 07:28.549
ever like think about
having another relationship?

07:28.649 --> 07:29.829
- No.
- Okay.

07:29.929 --> 07:33.070
But like in the future,
distant future, I dunno.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.510
Do you think about like..?

07:34.610 --> 07:35.831
Three features deadlines, an appointment

07:35.931 --> 07:38.391
to get ear wax extracted
from a child's ear

07:38.491 --> 07:40.792
and two World Book Day costumes

07:40.892 --> 07:42.072
that we haven't even started yet.

07:42.172 --> 07:43.312
Right? Those are the things that I need

07:43.412 --> 07:44.913
to think about before Friday,

07:45.013 --> 07:47.593
so no, I don't think about relationships

07:47.693 --> 07:48.554
in the distant future

07:48.654 --> 07:51.274
because I don't think
about the distant future.

07:51.374 --> 07:53.475
- I just think about.
- Ear wax.

07:53.575 --> 07:55.195
Yeah. Yeah, more than you know.

07:55.295 --> 07:57.296
- Why?
- Huh?

07:58.056 --> 08:00.056
What do you reckon?

08:00.736 --> 08:02.637
Come on mate. Time to
get back in the game.

08:02.737 --> 08:04.737
- Come on
- Come on.

08:05.097 --> 08:07.098
Really?

08:10.619 --> 08:12.279
Do you know what's weird?

08:12.379 --> 08:17.240
That neither of them feel
the need to come up for air?

08:17.340 --> 08:20.721
I mean, I'm actually
starting to worry for them.

08:20.821 --> 08:22.822
Do you think we should call someone?

08:26.863 --> 08:29.303
(soft music)

08:43.907 --> 08:45.907
Okay?

08:48.228 --> 08:51.228
I'm really sorry. I can't do this.

08:53.069 --> 08:55.909
(soft club music)

09:02.151 --> 09:06.072
(people indistinct chattering)

09:09.833 --> 09:12.553
- I envy that.
- What?

09:16.474 --> 09:19.855
Faith, you know, the kind of faith

09:19.955 --> 09:22.116
that allows you to
believe that she's okay,

09:23.116 --> 09:26.176
that she's in a better place,
that you'll see her again.

09:26.276 --> 09:29.617
The kind of faith that
allows you to experience all

09:29.717 --> 09:34.358
of this and just praise God.

09:36.799 --> 09:38.659
I'm not sure if that's what he's doing.

09:38.759 --> 09:40.760
[Ben] What do you think he's doing?

09:43.120 --> 09:45.121
I think he's searching for him.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.763
I'll go.

09:55.323 --> 09:59.244
(people indistinct chattering)

10:11.647 --> 10:13.648
- You promised me.
- What?

10:14.848 --> 10:17.368
You sat at our table
and you promised me that

10:18.809 --> 10:21.689
that you would keep our only child safe.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.511
Why couldn't you do that, hm?

10:26.611 --> 10:28.071
Why did you let this happen?

10:28.171 --> 10:29.031
Can we not do this now?

10:29.131 --> 10:31.612
- I want to know why.
- I don't know why!

10:34.012 --> 10:35.993
I don't know why any
of this had to happen.

10:36.093 --> 10:39.794
I don't think that everything
happens for a reason and I,

10:39.894 --> 10:42.114
and I don't believe that that
God moves in mysterious ways,

10:42.214 --> 10:43.355
'cause if he does and this is it,

10:43.455 --> 10:44.195
- then he can go...
- Oi!

10:44.295 --> 10:46.295
Well he didn't keep her safe, did he?

10:56.618 --> 11:00.319
I don't know why, but if blaming me

11:00.419 --> 11:02.159
makes you feel one iota
better, then go for it.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.259
'Cause you know what makes me feel better?

11:06.300 --> 11:08.300
Absolutely nothing.

11:11.341 --> 11:13.362
- Ben.
- Leave him alone.

11:13.462 --> 11:15.782
- Ben!
- Leave him alone!

11:25.985 --> 11:29.225
(door slamming closed)

11:31.826 --> 11:36.827
(sirens wailing)
(city traffic rumbling)

11:42.388 --> 11:47.310
- (door slamming)
- Oi, shh. You'll wake 'em.

11:52.271 --> 11:54.251
- Good night?
- No.

11:54.351 --> 11:57.552
- Oh God, why not?
- Mum, can you just leave it,

11:59.152 --> 12:00.613
please, all right, for tonight,

12:00.713 --> 12:02.173
can you actually just leave it?

12:02.273 --> 12:05.594
- I've had enough of this.
- Yeah, well go home then.

12:09.115 --> 12:10.935
You know, some people actually pay me

12:11.035 --> 12:12.976
to clean their houses, Ben.

12:13.076 --> 12:15.736
I have a job. I have a life.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.137
Do you think that I drive 200 miles

12:17.237 --> 12:18.857
down here every month for
the good of my health?

12:18.957 --> 12:20.137
Do you think this is easy for me?

12:20.237 --> 12:22.538
Do you think this is easy for me?

12:22.638 --> 12:27.019
Do you? Do you think that,
that eating and sleeping,

12:27.119 --> 12:28.979
walking, talking, breathing
in and out is easy for me

12:29.079 --> 12:29.820
'cause it's not, all right?

12:29.920 --> 12:31.580
- Nothing is easy for me.
- So move on.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.701
I tried! Right tonight, I tried.

12:35.801 --> 12:36.741
I actually tried.

12:36.841 --> 12:38.842
And even when I try.

12:42.242 --> 12:43.423
Look, you asked me if
tonight was a good night,

12:43.523 --> 12:47.844
and to be honest with you,
yeah, yeah it was, and then I.

12:55.606 --> 12:58.706
Do you remember a couple
years ago when Jack

12:58.806 --> 13:02.067
and Poppy wanted a glitter
party for their birthday.

13:02.167 --> 13:04.068
I had to ask Dee what one was

13:04.168 --> 13:05.348
- and she said it's just.
- A load of glitter.

13:05.448 --> 13:07.308
Yeah, it's just glitter, right?

13:07.408 --> 13:10.109
It's glitter drinks
and glitter face paint.

13:10.209 --> 13:13.210
Anyway, after you'd all left,

13:14.050 --> 13:16.050
it took me an age to clean the flat.

13:17.331 --> 13:20.231
But the funny thing is
right, even though I thought

13:20.331 --> 13:24.552
that I'd got it all, a couple
of days later, I'd be tidying

13:24.652 --> 13:26.653
up and I'd move something and ooh,

13:29.574 --> 13:31.574
there's a piece of glitter.

13:33.134 --> 13:34.675
And then a few days later,
there'd be another piece

13:34.775 --> 13:37.235
and had a couple of months
later, at Christmas maybe,

13:37.335 --> 13:42.337
or on Jess's birthday,
I'd be shaking the rug out

13:42.657 --> 13:47.258
and loads of pieces of
glitter would just fly off,

13:51.259 --> 13:55.020
even though I felt sure
that I'd got it all by then.

14:00.141 --> 14:02.141
That's what it feels like.

14:05.262 --> 14:08.843
Just when you think
you're, you're doing well.

14:08.943 --> 14:10.943
Just when you think you, you're healing,

14:14.544 --> 14:16.545
there's a piece of glitter

14:19.465 --> 14:24.466
and your heart breaks all over again.

14:30.348 --> 14:33.309
The truth is, I met someone
really special and she died

14:35.989 --> 14:38.150
and I'm never gonna meet
anyone as special again.

14:50.913 --> 14:54.514
So, not a good night then?

15:01.595 --> 15:04.196
(gentle music)

15:31.082 --> 15:33.083
This is my story now.

15:37.124 --> 15:41.325
We had two children
together and the next day.

15:50.287 --> 15:53.447
(churchgoers singing)

16:00.129 --> 16:01.909
This is where I want to get married.

16:02.009 --> 16:04.010
Oh, yeah?

16:05.010 --> 16:07.011
Got anyone in mind?

16:07.851 --> 16:11.011
(churchgoers singing)

16:23.814 --> 16:26.415
(gentle music)

16:40.058 --> 16:41.319
In you go.

16:41.419 --> 16:43.419
Hello, love.

16:46.220 --> 16:48.200
He's in a good mood.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.301
(door slams shut)
Doors!

16:50.781 --> 16:54.442
Poppy? What happened at school today?

16:54.542 --> 16:56.542
We're not talking about it.

16:59.743 --> 17:01.743
I'll go.

17:02.584 --> 17:04.584
- (door slams shut)
- [Ben And Linda] Doors!

17:06.424 --> 17:09.025
(gentle music)

17:15.067 --> 17:18.907
Guys, do you want to tell
me what happened today now?

17:20.468 --> 17:22.468
Are you gonna tell him?

17:24.109 --> 17:29.110
Okay. Well apparently Jack
said that their mummy was

17:30.470 --> 17:35.131
in heaven and then some kid
at school said, no she wasn't,

17:35.231 --> 17:37.172
because heaven doesn't exist.

17:37.272 --> 17:40.192
Is that true?
(gentle music)

17:46.634 --> 17:48.634
Erm.

17:52.555 --> 17:55.236
Don't. I just spoke to my dad.

17:57.036 --> 17:58.777
- How is he?
- Good.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.877
He mentioned christening them again.

18:01.958 --> 18:03.218
Look, I know you don't believe.

18:03.318 --> 18:04.178
- Yeah, I don't.
- And honestly,

18:04.278 --> 18:05.778
I'm not sure I believe either.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.899
But I would like them to be open

18:07.999 --> 18:10.239
to the possibility of
believing in something.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.440
I think it's important.

18:13.800 --> 18:14.861
It's important to my family

18:14.961 --> 18:17.621
- and it's important to me.
- Yeah, I know, I just.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.342
Do we really wanna start
raising our children

18:19.442 --> 18:23.002
by telling them that Jesus is magic?

18:25.883 --> 18:27.624
How about we start raising our children

18:27.724 --> 18:29.104
by showing them there's more

18:29.204 --> 18:30.824
than one way of looking at things.

18:30.924 --> 18:32.745
How about we do that, Ben?

18:32.845 --> 18:34.145
Can we at least have
a conversation about it?

18:34.245 --> 18:36.066
We just did.

18:36.166 --> 18:38.166
- (door shuts)
- Doors!

18:39.246 --> 18:41.807
(gentle music)

18:43.207 --> 18:45.208
Well, the truth is,

18:47.368 --> 18:50.829
that different people
believe different things,

18:50.929 --> 18:52.469
but nobody really knows.

18:52.569 --> 18:54.570
Well, where do you think she is?

18:57.571 --> 18:59.571
Well, I know where she is.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.292
She's in you, isn't she?

19:03.532 --> 19:05.272
She's part of you.

19:05.372 --> 19:09.573
She's in your eyes and
she's in your smile.

19:11.414 --> 19:13.414
She's in the things that you like.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.856
Did she like trains?

19:23.657 --> 19:26.817
- Yeah. Yeah, she did.
- Train mad.

19:27.978 --> 19:30.578
(gentle music)

19:39.380 --> 19:41.561
On the desk.

19:41.661 --> 19:42.361
So, the kids tea is in ...

19:42.461 --> 19:43.221
Mum, I'm sure whatever you were about

19:43.221 --> 19:44.122
to say was gonna be riveting,

19:44.222 --> 19:47.042
- but I've gotta go, okay.
- Fine.

19:47.142 --> 19:48.563
And you can take that down
for me while you're at it.

19:48.663 --> 19:52.083
- Okay.
- Why are you rushing?

19:52.183 --> 19:54.184
- Are we late?
- No.

20:00.905 --> 20:01.646
[Dee On Phone] You're late.

20:01.746 --> 20:03.926
But I've been writing for
this paper for six years.

20:04.026 --> 20:05.487
Do you know how many
actors I've interviewed

20:05.587 --> 20:07.327
for this column about rising stars?

20:07.427 --> 20:09.367
- Lots.
- Yeah, correct.

20:09.467 --> 20:10.568
And do you know how many have risen?

20:10.668 --> 20:11.568
- None.
- Yeah, correct again.

20:11.668 --> 20:12.848
Look, this is a pointless column

20:12.948 --> 20:15.049
that nobody's interested
in, least of all me.

20:15.149 --> 20:17.809
Also, nobody cares about plays.

20:17.909 --> 20:20.070
- Ah, just do it.
- Anyway, I'm here.

20:29.272 --> 20:33.493
Hi, hey, sorry, sorry,

20:33.593 --> 20:37.454
I had to run and haven't,
well, run in 10 years.

20:37.554 --> 20:39.294
- I can tell.
- Yeah.

20:39.394 --> 20:42.015
Anyway, thank you so much for doing this.

20:42.115 --> 20:44.136
Everyone at the paper is
really excited about it,

20:44.236 --> 20:46.236
so I'm just gonna find my dictaphone.

20:47.716 --> 20:48.577
Oh, here we go.

20:48.677 --> 20:50.677
Sorry. Bear with.

20:51.637 --> 20:55.438
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:57.599 --> 21:00.980
Sorry, we're just, we're
just doing an interview.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.080
Who with?

21:04.920 --> 21:06.301
Emma Lyttleton.

21:06.401 --> 21:09.161
It's funny, because I'm Emma Lyttleton.

21:12.802 --> 21:14.803
- Wait, so, so you're?
- Not.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.464
- No. Should I?
- Yeah.

21:19.564 --> 21:23.025
- Yeah, sure. Sorry.
- It's all right.

21:23.125 --> 21:25.125
Sorry.

21:29.326 --> 21:34.327
- Sorry. Right, that was awful.
- Which bit?

21:35.608 --> 21:37.888
[Ben] Pretty much all
of it so far, I'd say.

21:40.689 --> 21:42.949
- Do you do this a lot?
- Embarrass myself.

21:43.049 --> 21:45.750
- Interview people.
- Yeah, I, I do a bit

21:45.850 --> 21:48.831
for the paper and I also
write for a men's magazine.

21:48.931 --> 21:50.111
What's that?

21:50.211 --> 21:52.212
All cars, clothes, and
how to talk to women.

21:52.532 --> 21:55.312
I have never written an
article on how to talk to women.

21:55.412 --> 21:58.613
- Or read one, apparently.
- Okay, great.

21:59.733 --> 22:00.874
Should we start?

22:00.974 --> 22:04.815
Okay, cool. Recording.

22:06.335 --> 22:11.196
So Emma, is this the worst start

22:11.296 --> 22:13.297
to an interview you've ever had?

22:13.897 --> 22:15.037
I've never been interviewed before,

22:15.137 --> 22:16.717
so I've little to compare it to.

22:16.817 --> 22:18.038
Okay. Well you should
probably know it's,

22:18.138 --> 22:19.038
it's pretty bad.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.999
Do you think there's any
chance we can turn it around?

22:22.099 --> 22:24.479
I doubt it, but you know,

22:24.579 --> 22:26.580
we'll give it a try.

22:27.260 --> 22:29.260
So, what happens next?

22:30.421 --> 22:32.981
(upbeat music)
