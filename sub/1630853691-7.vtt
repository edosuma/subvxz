00:06.719 --> 00:07.719
Did you see who that was?

00:07.759 --> 00:09.199
Who, the hot girl?

00:09.320 --> 00:10.439
No, that's Groshovsky.

00:11.039 --> 00:12.039
Paul Groshovsky.

00:12.119 --> 00:13.359
His 'Seagull'
was a masterpiece,

00:13.439 --> 00:14.679
they teach it in graduate school

00:14.720 --> 00:15.720
College too.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.039
Shall I put it more plainly?

00:18.480 --> 00:19.679
If you could, yes.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.640
Get rid of that man
of yours right now,

00:21.719 --> 00:23.519
otherwise you'll be stuck
with him forever.

00:33.119 --> 00:34.119
I wanted to talk to you.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.159
You're either shooting a movie
or you're pregnant.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.320
I'm getting married.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.640
Mazel Tov.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
What happened
was a mistake, okay?

00:42.079 --> 00:43.520
So... it won't happen again.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.119
Of course.
Who'd go near you anyway?

00:47.320 --> 00:51.159
Can you help me join... Tinder?
-Tinder?

00:51.759 --> 00:53.159
I love curls.

00:53.240 --> 00:54.640
Coward! Coward!

00:54.719 --> 00:58.520
There's a man like you
in every port.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.119
What is this leg?

01:03.320 --> 01:04.519
What is it?

01:04.719 --> 01:08.120
It's fat, that what it is.
-You idiot.

01:08.439 --> 01:11.359
It's beautiful,
it's a woman's leg.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.439
What did you expect, a chicken leg?
I'm a woman.

01:14.519 --> 01:17.359
Look at this,
look at all this flesh.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.159
Stop, Ofer.
-It's like a peasant's leg.

01:19.239 --> 01:22.159
She milks cows,
puts a whole lamb on her neck,

01:22.239 --> 01:24.719
walks around with it, collects eggs,
strong, sturdy.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.439
Shut up.
-It's a building block.

01:26.519 --> 01:29.439
This cellulite of yours
you hate so much.

01:29.519 --> 01:32.719
It's a medal of honor! -It's fat that got stuck.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
Okay, Ofer, we get the picture.
Stop it. -And this ass!

01:38.200 --> 01:42.040
It's driving me crazy.
It's insane fertility! -Stop.

01:42.120 --> 01:45.439
You can't look at an ass like this
and not think about kids.

01:45.519 --> 01:47.680
You think about kids
when you look at my ass?

01:47.719 --> 01:49.159
Then you may be a pedophile.

01:49.239 --> 01:50.719
Could it be

01:50.760 --> 01:53.640
that you're excited that I'm...

01:53.760 --> 01:56.599
a girl who likes food and cake?

01:56.680 --> 02:00.680
And your other girlfriends
didn't like cake.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.359
I love you.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.719
Great.
-I really love you.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.199
You know how I know?
-How?

02:11.759 --> 02:13.520
Because you're not hot

02:14.479 --> 02:15.520
Yes.

02:15.639 --> 02:18.719
That could be
an indication. of love.

02:19.199 --> 02:21.360
I actually love you.

02:21.759 --> 02:24.280
You're not hot.
-You have to stop saying that.

02:24.319 --> 02:28.199
You have to stop saying that.
-You don't believe me, do you?

02:28.280 --> 02:30.520
It's just that
you don't really know me.

02:30.639 --> 02:33.039
True, I don't know you,
but I can still tell you

02:33.120 --> 02:34.639
that I love you
and that I've never felt like this...

02:34.719 --> 02:37.759
Great, enough, okay?
-In my life.

02:38.039 --> 02:38.719
Enough.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.159
Why is it enough?

02:41.319 --> 02:44.520
Why is it enough when
I love this flesh

02:44.560 --> 02:46.599
and this head so much,
why is it enough?

02:48.199 --> 02:49.680
You're so beautiful.

02:51.599 --> 02:53.039
Thank you.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.120
No, thank you.

02:55.719 --> 02:58.280
Thank you, thank you.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.520
Again?
-Just a quickie. -What's with you?

03:02.639 --> 03:03.719
Just a quickie.
-What are you, 16?

03:03.759 --> 03:06.360
Real quick, real quick.
-But I'm tired.

03:06.479 --> 03:08.039
Just a quickie.

03:08.319 --> 03:09.680
A quickie.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.319
"Reut, my love.

03:43.719 --> 03:48.520
"We've finally reached a point
where we're gonna rock this joint.

03:48.599 --> 03:53.159
"Under a canopy of stars,
the night is ours.

03:54.120 --> 03:58.039
"You make me so high,
we've reached the sky

03:58.199 --> 04:02.520
"After two years, oh my!
I'm the pudding and you're the pie.

04:02.639 --> 04:05.719
"I love you from your brow to your toes,
and so much more than anyone knows.

04:06.000 --> 04:06.599
"Yours, Buddha."

04:06.680 --> 04:08.199
He calls me Buddha.

04:14.039 --> 04:15.360
It's awful.

04:15.719 --> 04:18.360
Why?
No, it's nice.

04:19.519 --> 04:21.120
Really?
-Sure.

04:24.319 --> 04:26.199
I just have one little remark.
-See? It's awful.

04:26.319 --> 04:29.519
No, it's fine,
it's naive and...

04:29.560 --> 04:31.319
Tell me the truth.
-I am,

04:31.399 --> 04:35.639
there's just one tiny little thing...
-Well?

04:36.319 --> 04:41.040
I would add a sentence
that's a little more...

04:41.399 --> 04:42.519
specific.

04:43.079 --> 04:45.720
Something that tells me something
about Reut himself

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
or about your special relationship.

04:49.319 --> 04:52.199
You mean, something witty, like...

04:52.319 --> 04:54.360
"You look at me
with so much love that

04:54.399 --> 04:56.040
"I become the hand
and you the glove"

04:56.120 --> 04:57.319
Forget rhyming.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.199
Why? -Forget rhyming,
it's too limited.

05:00.279 --> 05:03.000
You've wasted so much time thinking
about a rhyme for 'sky',

05:03.079 --> 05:05.160
you ended up with 'pudding and pie'.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.480
We've reached the sky
you're the apple of my eye.

05:06.519 --> 05:07.639
We've reached the sky,
now we shall die.

05:07.720 --> 05:10.639
It just makes you
write nonsense,

05:10.720 --> 05:12.360
instead of telling the truth.

05:12.439 --> 05:15.040
Then why did you say it's nice?
You don't think it's nice.

05:18.040 --> 05:19.759
No, it is nice.

05:21.639 --> 05:23.360
The part about the brow is...

05:23.480 --> 05:25.600
It's cute.
-And aside from that?

05:26.319 --> 05:27.759
It's not...
-It's not good, it's not good.

05:28.040 --> 05:31.519
It is good, but it's not a matter
of good or not good, it's...

05:32.519 --> 05:36.160
You know, I wrote
my wedding vows to Tomer

05:36.240 --> 05:38.199
after our first year together.

05:39.079 --> 05:41.360
I'm such an idiot.
-And?

05:41.720 --> 05:44.160
He took me to a vacation cabin,

05:44.240 --> 05:46.439
so I was sure
he was going to propose.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.360
He didn't propose or anything,

05:49.439 --> 05:51.439
we just fought all day
and he said

05:51.519 --> 05:53.639
he's just not ready
to move in together, so...

05:53.720 --> 05:55.600
Why didn't you leave him then?

05:56.279 --> 05:59.160
Why?
I thought things would work out.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.360
You write it for me.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.160
What?
-You write it.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.199
Or just give me
what you wrote to Tomer,

06:12.279 --> 06:14.040
for all I care.
as long as it's nice

06:14.319 --> 06:16.160
Maya, I'm not writing it.

06:16.240 --> 06:19.040
I have to go upstairs.
I'm counting on you, Iris.

06:19.560 --> 06:22.360
Don't bring a check,
I don't want a check.

06:26.759 --> 06:31.240
She said there's no running water
because there's no budget for it,

06:31.360 --> 06:33.639
and we won't get half of
the appliances we asked for

06:33.720 --> 06:36.040
because there aren't
enough outlets on stage.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.720
And I don't know what
we'll do about the laundry scene

06:38.759 --> 06:40.480
I can't believe
they told me

06:40.560 --> 06:42.399
two minutes
before the first run...

06:42.519 --> 06:44.040
Good morning.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.360
Good morning.
-Ofer, what are you doing here?

06:46.399 --> 06:47.759
We're doing a run for Vera,

06:48.040 --> 06:49.759
I asked you guys
to go over the script.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.759
Yeah, I just asked them
to print mine out again.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.759
What happened to your text?
-I lost it.

06:57.279 --> 07:01.800
But I know the whole thing
by heart, don't worry.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.759
Anyway, I'll come back...

07:10.199 --> 07:11.639
some other time.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.680
And we're supposed
to rely on him... So,

07:16.160 --> 07:17.360
what do you think?

07:17.439 --> 07:18.519
It's nice.

07:20.360 --> 07:21.399
What's nice?

07:21.519 --> 07:23.199
It's nice, the set is nice.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.319
What, with the electricity?
-Great.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.319
This is nice? Thank you.
-No, no. -Fine.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.040
It's not nice.
-Thanks a lot.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.360
I'll go take a look at...
-The electricity.

07:30.399 --> 07:31.639
I'll go to take a look at the set.
-Okay.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.399
Good luck to us.
-Things always work out...

07:37.759 --> 07:40.079
Hello.

07:41.480 --> 07:42.680
The actors are a little nervous,

07:42.759 --> 07:45.079
it's the first time
we have an audience,

07:45.279 --> 07:48.399
so we'll try to do a run
from the top,

07:48.519 --> 07:53.399
if there's a problem, we'll stop,
fix it and continue. -Good luck.

07:54.759 --> 07:55.639
Go ahead.

07:58.279 --> 08:00.639
And lights.

08:05.399 --> 08:07.759
Tzutz, look.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.360
What? -Our own apartment,
what do you think?

08:13.079 --> 08:15.639
It's our own.
It's a good apartment.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.360
You think
we made a mistake?

08:17.439 --> 08:19.680
With the apartment?
-Moving in together?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.360
Do you regret it?
-I don't, do you?

08:23.199 --> 08:24.639
I do.
-What?

08:25.639 --> 08:27.399
I'm used to living alone.

08:27.759 --> 08:30.560
Listen, we'll be like roommates who
sleep together

08:30.600 --> 08:32.080
I can live with that.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.639
Then let's mark our territory.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.200
Okay, what should I do?
Pee around?

08:36.279 --> 08:39.399
No, but we need a constitution,
let's make some rules.

08:39.440 --> 08:40.799
First rule.
-Yes.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.399
If you find
one of my shirts on the floor,

08:43.480 --> 08:47.240
don't touch it! There's thought behind it.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.679
Whoever doesn't replace the toilet paper roll,
should watch out.

08:50.759 --> 08:53.399
If anyone suspects

08:53.600 --> 08:56.039
that the milk or yogurt
in the fridge have expired,

08:56.120 --> 08:58.639
you have to throw it away
before the other one drinks it.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.759
Hair may clog the shower drain
from time to time,

09:03.039 --> 09:06.639
don't worry, don't panic,
dude, it'll be taken care of.

09:07.159 --> 09:09.480
No one calls me 'dude'
in this house. -Why not? It's funny.

09:09.559 --> 09:10.559
I don't think so.

09:10.679 --> 09:11.720
Agreed.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.559
What now?
-We organize things.

09:14.799 --> 09:16.559
After that?
-We live here.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.799
Two, three and...

09:20.120 --> 09:21.480
Black. Great. Music...
-Wait,

09:21.559 --> 09:23.240
I'm sorry to interrupt.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.559
Does it go on like this?

09:25.639 --> 09:28.080
Uh... yes, now

09:28.159 --> 09:29.399
it starts getting a little funnier.

09:29.519 --> 09:31.240
They don't move at all?
-Excuse me?

09:31.320 --> 09:32.559
They don't move at all?

09:37.759 --> 09:40.399
The beginning is a little static.

09:42.639 --> 09:43.639
Paul,

09:47.480 --> 09:50.559
Oh, she's asking
if you want to say something.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.240
It's... the concept.

10:53.679 --> 10:55.759
Concept.
-What? -Concept.

10:58.799 --> 11:00.759
What nonsense.

11:52.320 --> 11:56.399
Sarel. -A t-shirt, please.
-Hurry.

12:37.360 --> 12:40.559
Holy shit!

12:42.240 --> 12:43.799
Let him, let him.
-Vera!

12:57.519 --> 12:59.240
Leave the toilet.

13:03.519 --> 13:06.039
You guys do it,
don't let him help.

14:30.559 --> 14:33.039
Kasha, cigarette.

14:33.399 --> 14:35.360
You can't smoke in here.

14:35.759 --> 14:37.799
He can. It's okay.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.480
Thank you.

15:22.679 --> 15:24.559
Isn't this amazing?

15:24.720 --> 15:27.080
Maybe I won't pay you.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.679
Maybe you should be paying me

15:28.759 --> 15:32.759
for the lessons you get for free
from a master? What do you say?

15:33.120 --> 15:37.799
Anyway, continue from here,
just try not to ruin it, okay?

15:48.080 --> 15:52.639
Hey, I think you're a great director,
it's just a shame

15:52.720 --> 15:55.720
you're sleeping with a woman
half your age.

15:55.759 --> 16:00.159
I think it's disgusting,
but the ideas are great, really, you're...

16:00.360 --> 16:01.559
a shitty person.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.240
Let her go already,
let her live.

16:09.679 --> 16:11.039
Are we done?

16:21.399 --> 16:22.759
Take a break.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.639
And...

16:26.320 --> 16:29.360
do... do whatever you want.
I don't care.

16:49.559 --> 16:51.159
What's up?

16:52.519 --> 16:54.039
I'm fine, how are you?

16:54.679 --> 16:55.559
Why did you have to do that?

16:55.639 --> 16:58.360
Why humiliate him?
He upgraded our play.

16:58.399 --> 16:59.639
What do you want?

16:59.720 --> 17:01.519
Do you have anything
in particular to say?

17:02.200 --> 17:03.519
No.
-Fine.

17:03.559 --> 17:05.039
Where are you going?

17:05.119 --> 17:08.680
To buy some food and get back to work.
I have to change loads of things.

17:08.799 --> 17:11.359
Okay, I'll stay with you.
-No thanks.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.559
It's my job,
I'm the director.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.400
If you're the director,
you're the director.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.079
Are you no longer interested
in the production?

17:17.160 --> 17:18.480
Are you done?

17:18.559 --> 17:20.079
Why do you say that?

17:20.160 --> 17:21.240
I don't know.

17:21.359 --> 17:23.559
You're all giggly... with Ofer.

17:24.759 --> 17:26.480
Are you...

17:26.559 --> 17:28.759
Are you with him?
Are you dating Ofer?

17:31.599 --> 17:34.759
Yes. -Seriously?
-Seriously.

17:36.359 --> 17:37.519
What's the problem?

17:38.279 --> 17:41.240
What's the problem with me
being with Ofer? -Sorry.

17:43.359 --> 17:45.319
What's so funny?
-Nothing.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.200
No, no, nothing, it's cool.

17:49.039 --> 17:50.480
Watch out for STDs.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.359
He does not believe
in the theater.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.559
He used to laugh at me.

18:04.759 --> 18:06.200
He used to laugh
at my dreams,

18:07.119 --> 18:08.480
so that little by little
I became down-hearted.

18:09.720 --> 18:11.680
I could not control my voice.

18:12.680 --> 18:15.240
I didn't know how
to stand on stage,

18:15.359 --> 18:17.240
I never knew
what to do with my hands

18:17.759 --> 18:21.519
You cannot imagine the state of mind
of one who knows

18:22.119 --> 18:25.039
as he goes through a play
how terribly badly he is acting.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.400
Again.

18:27.559 --> 18:29.759
I am so tired.

18:30.799 --> 18:32.680
If I could only rest.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.240
Rest a little.

18:36.359 --> 18:38.079
Rest.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.559
I am a sea-gull.

18:44.160 --> 18:47.160
No, no, now I am a real actress.

18:49.119 --> 18:53.359
He does not believe in the theater,
he used to laugh at me,

18:53.480 --> 18:55.359
at my dreams,

18:55.519 --> 18:57.359
I became down-hearted.

18:58.319 --> 19:02.160
I could not control my voice.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.200
I never knew
what to do with my hands.

19:04.680 --> 19:08.359
Can you imagine?
Being on stage,

19:08.799 --> 19:12.359
Knowing in your heart
that your acting is terrible?

19:16.240 --> 19:19.480
Dear guests, Maya and Reut's
wedding ceremony is about to begin.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.400
Please, come up to the canopy.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.519
Buddha, switch sides with me.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.240
What?

19:45.359 --> 19:48.759
I want to switch sides.
-Okay.

19:48.799 --> 19:50.519
One moment, please.

19:54.279 --> 19:57.680
The parents have to switch sides, too.

19:59.160 --> 20:01.240
This is my good side.

20:02.240 --> 20:06.400
You're the most beautiful woman,
body and soul,

20:06.480 --> 20:11.519
and every day is a wonder with you,
making you happy is my goal.

20:12.279 --> 20:15.200
I'm grateful for you,
for our families,

20:15.440 --> 20:17.240
for the skies above,

20:17.319 --> 20:19.559
and for Shiri who helped us fall in love

20:21.799 --> 20:25.079
I love you, Buddha,
really, for life.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.240
So lets have tons of kids,
now you're my wife.

20:30.759 --> 20:32.240
Lovely.

20:32.359 --> 20:36.799
Wow, I'm so excited,
I didn't think I'd be this excited,

20:37.079 --> 20:40.559
I'm used to standing
before an audience.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.759
Full disclosure,

20:48.519 --> 20:53.359
I wrote my vows before I knew
you were going to propose.

20:58.519 --> 21:00.400
Which means I'm totally pathetic,

21:00.480 --> 21:03.759
but it also means that
I really do want to marry you

21:04.039 --> 21:07.160
and that I didn't say yes
just because you proposed.

21:08.039 --> 21:11.480
So the answer to your question
which you have not yet asked is yes.

21:12.200 --> 21:14.200
I'd love to marry you.

21:15.799 --> 21:19.480
Although
getting married is sheer chutzpah, right?

21:24.359 --> 21:28.559
Why should we stand here like two idiots
dressed up like bride and groom

21:29.759 --> 21:33.680
and pretend that everything's
super easy, while we both know

21:34.400 --> 21:37.039
and everyone standing around
the canopy knows

21:37.119 --> 21:39.640
how hard it is to succeed as a couple

21:42.160 --> 21:44.720
and that this beautiful canopy
is only the beginning of our journey

21:44.759 --> 21:47.759
that no one knows
where and how it'll end.

21:49.359 --> 21:52.480
Wow, I'm becoming convinced
that I shouldn't marry you.

22:00.039 --> 22:02.079
But nevertheless,
I close my eyes

22:02.160 --> 22:05.559
and go to a tiny, pure place
in my heart

22:05.599 --> 22:09.400
that was fortunate enough to meet
the pure place in your heart

22:09.519 --> 22:13.240
and they're sitting on the couch
in one of the heart's chambers,

22:13.319 --> 22:17.079
probably in front of the TV.

22:17.759 --> 22:20.319
Devoid of any cynicism and defenses,

22:20.400 --> 22:25.640
asking to believe that this time
things will turn out well. Period.

22:26.319 --> 22:29.400
Some people may call me foolish,
but I'm going for it.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.319
You're amazing.

22:40.119 --> 22:41.680
Break the glass.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.400
Cheers.
-Cheers.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.200
How's it going?

23:40.640 --> 23:42.079
Fine.

23:50.400 --> 23:54.559
Listen, buddy, I can't handle
the elephant in the room.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.079
No, there's no elephant in the room.
-You know there is.

23:56.160 --> 23:57.240
No, really.

23:57.319 --> 23:58.799
She's not an elephant
and it's all good.

23:59.599 --> 24:01.200
Really, she's a big girl,

24:01.279 --> 24:02.799
she can do whatever she wants.
-No, I know,

24:03.079 --> 24:04.359
of course, it's not...

24:04.519 --> 24:08.680
I just want you
to hear it from me.

24:09.119 --> 24:11.200
Man to man,
I want to tell you,

24:11.279 --> 24:14.359
if it didn't mean anything,
I wouldn't do it.

24:14.519 --> 24:16.400
Okay.
-And you know,

24:16.559 --> 24:19.079
you left her.
You told us.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.559
I don't know.
Yes, I guess.

24:22.680 --> 24:26.160
If she had left you
and you were heartbroken and all,

24:26.240 --> 24:27.559
I wouldn't have.

24:28.039 --> 24:29.240
Cool.

24:30.759 --> 24:33.240
It was unexpected.

24:33.400 --> 24:37.079
I'm still shocked that it's happening.

24:37.160 --> 24:39.400
No, she's...
-She's so amazing.

24:39.480 --> 24:40.559
Iris, yes.

24:41.079 --> 24:44.200
But you're my director, too.
-It's fine.

24:44.279 --> 24:45.559
Fine.

24:46.599 --> 24:50.480
I just don't like keeping
stuff like this bottled up inside.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.559
I didn't even realize
I was into her

25:02.640 --> 25:04.640
until we were sitting at that play

25:04.720 --> 25:06.240
and she says to me...

25:06.400 --> 25:08.799
that nutcase says
that she likes to kiss,

25:09.079 --> 25:10.559
that she met some idiot
on Tinder and they...

25:10.680 --> 25:13.240
I don't think I need all the...
-They kissed and it...

25:13.359 --> 25:14.559
it pissed me off!

25:14.680 --> 25:16.559
I thought,
damn, that pissed me off!

25:16.680 --> 25:19.240
Then I realized
I was in love with her.

25:19.359 --> 25:21.799
Okay.
-Wait, listen, it's not...

25:22.079 --> 25:24.559
I want to tell you something
that's important.

25:26.359 --> 25:30.559
I know, she means a lot to you,
you were together for many years.

25:30.599 --> 25:34.240
You mean
a lot to me too, really...

25:34.519 --> 25:36.759
I just wanted to tell you that...

25:37.519 --> 25:41.079
Don't worry,
she's in good hands.

25:43.039 --> 25:44.240
I'm not worried.

25:45.680 --> 25:47.079
Again.

26:03.599 --> 26:05.079
Yuvi!

26:12.039 --> 26:15.240
You're the love of my life,
the love of my life.

26:15.319 --> 26:16.759
You're THE man!
Get him some water.

26:17.039 --> 26:19.079
No, no, no, listen.

26:19.359 --> 26:21.079
I love you, bro.

26:21.519 --> 26:23.359
You're the love of my life.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.720
You're in my heart.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.400
You're my brother.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.559
I love you.
-Love you, man.

26:37.119 --> 26:38.319
C'mon.

26:55.440 --> 26:55.759
Raise your hands high!

26:57.279 --> 26:58.480
Congrats!

26:59.440 --> 27:00.680
How did it go?

27:04.559 --> 27:07.400
Vera, I just want to say that...

27:07.519 --> 27:10.319
I have lots of new ideas and...

27:11.079 --> 27:12.680
I'll be making a lot of changes.

27:13.279 --> 27:15.680
Based on what he suggested,
of course, but...

27:15.759 --> 27:20.680
Why shawarma, sushi and ravioli
all together? Why?

27:21.400 --> 27:24.319
Listen, opening night is next week,

27:24.359 --> 27:27.079
so you're almost out of time.

27:27.240 --> 27:32.200
so if next time I come to see a run
and it's no good, I'll have you replaced

27:32.480 --> 27:34.079
and you'll be out the frickin' door.

27:34.599 --> 27:36.079
Bon appetit.

27:50.119 --> 27:52.559
What is this?

27:52.559 --> 27:54.759
Look at this.

28:00.759 --> 28:03.359
Look at this.

28:11.079 --> 28:13.400
What are you doing,
are you crazy?

28:17.039 --> 28:19.559
She was just helping me
with something.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.039
What was she helping you with?
-What?

28:22.119 --> 28:24.240
Iris, don't tell Vera.

28:24.319 --> 28:26.400
Yeah, it's nothing,
it's not...

28:26.559 --> 28:27.720
It's nothing, it's nothing.

28:27.759 --> 28:30.720
I don't understand what's going on.
-You're nothing. -Yeah.

28:31.559 --> 28:32.680
Oh no...

28:32.759 --> 28:35.240
I don't understand,

28:35.359 --> 28:37.400
I don't understand anything.
-Nothing, I was here...

28:37.759 --> 28:40.240
puking my guts out,
so she...

28:40.519 --> 28:43.359
No, like... already?

28:43.440 --> 28:44.559
Wait one second.

28:45.440 --> 28:48.240
Yesterday you told me
you're in love with me 700 times.

28:48.359 --> 28:49.559
So wait...
-I am in love with you,

28:49.559 --> 28:51.359
you think I was lying?
-Listen,

28:51.400 --> 28:53.559
something is wrong with you.
-What do you mean, wrong?

28:53.559 --> 28:55.079
I'm telling you...
-Something's wrong.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.400
I was puking my guts out.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.799
Instead of helping me...
-No,

28:58.039 --> 28:59.559
something is wrong with you.
-Instead of being sensitive...

28:59.559 --> 29:01.559
Iris!

29:19.279 --> 29:20.519
Come here.

29:21.599 --> 29:22.759
Let me go.

29:23.559 --> 29:25.759
It was nothing, Iris.

30:06.559 --> 30:07.640
Thank you.

30:08.559 --> 30:10.240
For what?

30:12.039 --> 30:14.400
For being so brave.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.640
And for putting
that mistake behind us.

30:19.559 --> 30:21.039
Bravo.

30:21.359 --> 30:22.359
You...

30:22.440 --> 30:25.359
helped me realize
how much I love him.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.240
Thank you.

30:30.480 --> 30:33.200
I can't stop thinking about you.
-What?

30:35.799 --> 30:38.240
I can't stop thinking about you.

32:54.759 --> 32:57.559
They're so gross,
they're polluting the dance-floor.

32:59.039 --> 33:01.720
People are leaving
because of them.

33:17.599 --> 33:19.480
No thanks.
-Yes, please.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.319
Thank you.

33:44.359 --> 33:45.839
Enjoy.

34:17.559 --> 34:20.400
Just kidding, just kidding,
just kidding.
