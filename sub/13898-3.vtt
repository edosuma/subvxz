I thought you said it wasn't
flammable. I'm on fire!

00:11.340 --> 00:13.050
It's not flammable,
but clothes are --

00:13.090 --> 00:14.840
clothes are flammable, Des!

00:14.890 --> 00:16.260
Stop running!

00:16.300 --> 00:18.930
No no no! I gotta stop drop
and run! Or is it roll?

00:18.970 --> 00:20.390
Should I run? Should I run?

00:20.430 --> 00:21.390
Shhh!

00:21.430 --> 00:22.770
Should I roll?

I'm on fire, I'm on fire...

00:26.940 --> 00:29.650
Okay! Okay!
Just close your eyes.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.870
Oh my god!
What are they doing here?

00:38.950 --> 00:40.080
What the hell
is going on in here?

00:40.120 --> 00:41.200
I have no idea.

It can do like a quarter mile

I can almost feel the speeding
tickets already.

01:19.450 --> 01:21.660
Yeah. That's a bit of an
exaggeration, don't you think?

Good job.

this is my son Jake.

Jake, Bradley needs our

02:31.860 --> 02:32.980
help finding his wife.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.900
I need discretion.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.990
This is obviously a very very
sensitive matter.

02:38.030 --> 02:40.320
Of course.
We're professionals.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.030
My wife. Janel...

02:42.070 --> 02:43.660
She's supposed to be dead.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.700
We were vacationing in Hawaii
two years ago.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.290
We assumed she drowned.

02:48.330 --> 02:48.750
No body was recovered?

02:50.120 --> 02:52.170
Hawaii's a bit out of our
catchment zone, isn't it?

02:52.210 --> 02:53.840
A week or so ago, I saw this in

02:53.880 --> 02:56.590
the paper, your paper. Here.

02:56.630 --> 02:57.470
Achoo!

Sorry, sorry.

Have had terrible allergies
since I got here.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.510
Well this is definitely the same
girl, or it looks like it.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.180
The question is, if she's
supposed to be dead,

03:06.220 --> 03:07.810
what's she doing at
the Folk Festival?

03:07.850 --> 03:09.270
I thought I was crazy.

03:09.310 --> 03:12.860
They say you see your spouse
everywhere after they die,

03:12.900 --> 03:16.070
but this is her.
I need your help,

03:16.110 --> 03:18.110
and money is no obstacle.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.610
Good. I hate those
kind of obstacles.

03:20.450 --> 03:20.530
Could I use your bathroom?

03:21.660 --> 03:23.450
Oh, yes, of course.
Just follow me.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.120
Maybe it's
the constant sneezing,

03:29.160 --> 03:30.870
but do you get
a creepy feeling off him?

03:30.910 --> 03:33.080
I hate these kind of cases.
You know, we could be leading

03:33.130 --> 03:34.920
a wacko stalker
right to his target, or

03:34.960 --> 03:35.210
if she is really his wife,

03:36.630 --> 03:38.460
maybe she needed to get away
from him for a reason.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.920
He'll get someone else
if not us.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.220
We can at least control
the situation this way.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.930
Kyla MacRury. I know the girl
who wrote this article.

03:44.970 --> 03:45.810
I'm sure you do.

03:46.510 --> 03:47.680
Nice job on the car.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.680
[snorts] Not.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.690
[Des] Why are you digging up
stuff on this guy?

03:56.730 --> 03:57.940
His history is a little off...

03:57.980 --> 03:59.780
I mean he was
Jake's old partner in the RNC

03:59.820 --> 04:01.440
and then he kills
this drug misses --

04:01.490 --> 04:03.700
Was accused of killing. Never
convicted or stood trial.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.580
Right, ‘cause he disappeared
for like ten years.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.200
That's one way to beat it,
hey b'y?

04:08.240 --> 04:10.660
...then he came back
and kidnapped us.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.330
What are the odds
that he would kidnap me?

04:12.370 --> 04:14.420
Odds of what?...
Tinny --

04:14.460 --> 04:17.040
Why are you so interested
in Kevin Crocker?

04:17.090 --> 04:18.880
As we both know infatuation
leads to broken promises

04:18.920 --> 04:20.300
and the odd late
night drunken text...

04:20.340 --> 04:22.430
Tinny -- this isn't you.
You're not this person...

04:22.470 --> 04:23.510
Shut up.

04:25.090 --> 04:26.050
What's this?

04:26.090 --> 04:27.760
It's a shirt
that I got for you.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.180
Wha-for-me-why,
are-you-going-to-hurt-me?

04:29.220 --> 04:31.060
- Is this gift preemptive?
- Kind of.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.100
Where is it gonna land?
Is it the face?

04:32.140 --> 04:33.060
Because I can handle the face.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.690
Kevin Crocker is my dad.

04:37.230 --> 04:39.020
The guy who had us held up
in a salt meat factory...

04:39.070 --> 04:40.900
...is my biological father. Yes.

04:40.940 --> 04:42.320
Holy crap sticks.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.070
He kidnapped me, Tinny...
He kidnapped you too!

04:47.580 --> 04:48.830
Well he didn't know he was
kidnapping his own daughter.

04:49.700 --> 04:50.870
Why are you just telling me now?

04:50.910 --> 04:51.950
I wanted to wait
until you were fully healed.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.210
No one knows, okay?
So keep this between us.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.210
What about Jake?

04:56.250 --> 04:58.170
Especially don't tell Jake.

04:58.210 --> 05:01.670
So what, are you going to tell
the madman convict Kevin Crocker

05:01.710 --> 05:02.970
that you're his kin and then
like what, go visit him?

05:03.010 --> 05:04.260
Maybe.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.800
I just wanna look him
in the eye, you know?

05:06.840 --> 05:09.680
See what's behind the terrible
man we know about.

05:09.720 --> 05:13.430
This is a lot to process, this
is way -- it's a lot to process.

05:13.480 --> 05:16.100
But then again you did buy me
this nice shirt.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.270
Which means you care about how I
would take this,

05:17.310 --> 05:18.650
which means you care --

05:18.690 --> 05:20.270
-Shut up.
-Okay.

05:21.820 --> 05:22.780
-Mom's here!
-Wha?

05:22.820 --> 05:23.780
Take it.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.240
Hide it!

05:28.990 --> 05:30.160
What's on the G-O, guys?

05:30.200 --> 05:32.370
Ah hi, I gotta go to work.
So Hi! Bye!

05:37.290 --> 05:40.170
He's almost a genius, almost an
idiot. It's very odd...

05:40.590 --> 05:41.960
Tinny...

05:43.050 --> 05:44.300
Why do you have that photo?

05:44.920 --> 05:46.130
It's nothing.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.590
No, it's not nothing.
We need to talk about

05:47.630 --> 05:49.470
whatever it is you're thinking
about doing here.

05:49.510 --> 05:53.520
Mom, seriously,
just let me obsess over this.

05:54.930 --> 05:57.810
If I need to dig into his past,
just let me, okay?

05:57.850 --> 05:58.810
I need to follow through.

05:58.850 --> 06:00.360
Follow through on what?

06:00.400 --> 06:01.440
I don't know yet.

06:08.030 --> 06:08.530
Kyla MacRury.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.370
How's my favorite Newfoundland
and Labrador arts reporter?

06:13.240 --> 06:14.580
What can I do for you today?

06:14.620 --> 06:16.330
I need your help
with a case I'm working on.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.330
And, you know,
if it's newsworthy,

06:18.370 --> 06:19.960
you'll get
the first crack at it.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.750
A 'case' like the one you handed
me about a corrupt mayor

06:21.790 --> 06:22.880
kind of case?

06:22.920 --> 06:25.210
Or is it like your
missing horse case?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.970
Well, it's hard to tell, but...
you covered and shot

06:28.010 --> 06:29.140
the Folk Festival, right?

06:29.180 --> 06:30.260
Yep.

06:30.300 --> 06:31.640
I'm looking for
some intel on this girl.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.140
This how you find
all your love interests?

06:35.100 --> 06:37.730
I took it,
but I don't know the missus.

06:37.770 --> 06:39.390
I mean, this town is small
but it's not that small.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.560
Okay, how about I get a look

06:40.600 --> 06:41.900
at all the other shots
you took that day.

06:41.940 --> 06:43.440
See if I can get
a clearer image.

06:43.480 --> 06:46.360
Sure. But... you've given me
some good stories in the past

06:46.400 --> 06:48.320
and all of a sudden
you just stopped calling.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.110
Something I said?

06:50.160 --> 06:51.700
No. No, no, I was just waiting

06:51.740 --> 06:53.080
for something that was worthy
of your awesome... ness.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.580
If I find out you've cozied up
to some other reporter who will

06:56.620 --> 06:58.910
actually make out with you --
I won't be happy.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.250
Heh heh. You know, you could
just make out with me.

07:01.290 --> 07:04.420
Send a message to all other
reporters, kind of like marking

07:04.460 --> 07:05.710
your territory, kinda thing.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.470
Ta! Not going to happen, Jakey.

07:08.510 --> 07:11.970
I will send you those pictures
but you still owe me.

07:12.010 --> 07:13.180
Okay. I owe you.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.320
Okay, so there's a bunch of
shots here, but three of them

07:29.360 --> 07:32.240
have Janel -- which is too bad
because she's really photogenic.

07:32.280 --> 07:33.530
[phone ringing]
I bet she's an autumn.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.530
Dad. What do you got?

07:35.580 --> 07:38.240
Apparently Janel's police file
has been sealed.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.290
Leslie might be the best person
to help us get access.

07:40.330 --> 07:43.000
Look, that's all what I would
call a bit complicated.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.590
What did you do
to poor Leslie this time?

07:44.630 --> 07:46.380
No, I didn't do anything to her.

07:46.420 --> 07:47.510
It's not that, okay.
It's just complicated, so...

07:49.050 --> 07:51.130
I'm here with Bradley. We're
going over everything to see

07:51.170 --> 07:53.510
if he has any more
info to help us.

07:53.550 --> 07:55.100
Alright. Look, I'll try
and contact Leslie.

07:55.140 --> 07:57.180
But just I can't make any
promises.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.470
I'll talk to you later.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.940
[sniff]
Can you be allergic to fog?

08:01.980 --> 08:04.980
I suppose anything's possible?

08:05.020 --> 08:06.070
Achoo!

08:07.690 --> 08:09.940
That's weird. That's Janel.

08:11.030 --> 08:12.320
What's with all the kids?

08:12.360 --> 08:13.740
Um, maybe she has candy?

08:13.780 --> 08:15.490
Nudding wrong with a bit of one-
cent candy, hey, b'y?

08:15.530 --> 08:16.660
Although, that'd be weird
for her to lure the children

08:16.700 --> 08:17.700
with candy.

08:17.740 --> 08:18.870
She doesn't look
like the type so...

08:20.080 --> 08:22.500
Or it's a daycare. She works at,
or runs --

08:22.540 --> 08:24.120
-- a daycare, right.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.130
Run a check on all the daycares
in the area

08:25.170 --> 08:26.840
close to Bannerman Park?

08:26.880 --> 08:29.920
Okay. And hey, don't you think
our shirts look alike?

08:30.420 --> 08:31.420
No.

08:45.060 --> 08:46.770
That's all we got.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.030
Oxy's in short supply.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.690
I gotta make this count.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.320
[phone ringing]

08:55.160 --> 08:56.870
Somewhere you needs to be?

08:56.910 --> 08:58.080
No.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.330
Why?

08:59.740 --> 09:00.870
Jealous?

09:00.910 --> 09:02.710
You wish, Princess.

09:04.330 --> 09:07.710
So...
Feel like little a promotion?

09:09.290 --> 09:10.710
What's that supposed to mean?

09:10.750 --> 09:13.470
Feel like selling a bit of this
gear for me out there?

09:13.510 --> 09:16.340
More money...
more responsibility.

09:17.470 --> 09:19.680
You sure knows
how to talk to a gal.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.600
So? You up for it,
Mount Pearl princess?

09:24.850 --> 09:28.270
Feel like puntin' a little
hillbilly heroin?

09:30.110 --> 09:31.650
They're beautiful, actually --

09:32.900 --> 09:36.570
If you lets me sell it --
I won't forget it.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.990
The opportunity, I mean --

09:41.740 --> 09:45.580
And no using, alright?
I want you to sell it.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.670
And you sells for me.

09:48.710 --> 09:54.130
You wants to use it,
you buys from me. Got it?

09:55.970 --> 09:56.090
I got it.

09:57.510 --> 10:02.220
Unless you can think of
a better way of to pay me.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.560
I'm not getting naked for you,
Taylor.

10:06.600 --> 10:11.230
You'll get naked when
I tells ya to, believe that.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.070
Sell as much as you can.

10:14.780 --> 10:15.990
If you does good...

10:17.240 --> 10:20.830
Ah, we'll talk about
that naked bit. Okay?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.460
[phone ringing]

10:42.180 --> 10:44.640
"The customer you are trying to
reach is currently unavailable.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.850
Please try again later."

10:47.680 --> 10:49.980
So... Tinny's cool. Huh?

10:50.020 --> 10:52.730
Des, if you're looking for my
blessing to date her, please.

10:52.770 --> 10:55.320
Okay, we've been making some
good progress so don't blow it.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.570
No, no, I'm not doing that weird
thing that you think I'm doing.

10:57.610 --> 11:00.070
I'm just asking if you think
she's... doing well. Like...

11:00.110 --> 11:02.280
maybe she has a lot on her mind?

11:02.320 --> 11:04.660
Maybe she needs
someone to talk to?

11:04.700 --> 11:06.580
About what? You?

11:06.620 --> 11:08.040
Whoa! Whoa, whoa whoa.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.540
It's Janel. Jake, it's her.

11:11.580 --> 11:12.960
It looks like her.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.340
We can't do anything until we're
absolutely sure.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.010
Let's go in and have
a look around.

11:17.050 --> 11:19.220
And stop talking about my niece.

11:20.130 --> 11:21.090
Word.

11:22.550 --> 11:24.560
Ah! Oh.

11:25.510 --> 11:25.720
Des! Just try to keep it quiet.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.020
Right. Seeing you're always
teaching, I think you'd be

11:29.060 --> 11:29.560
a wonderful dad.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.770
What?
What are you talking about.

11:31.810 --> 11:33.480
Unlike some people
who have terrible dads,

11:33.520 --> 11:35.400
people have terrible dads.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.610
I mean not everyone, but, not
some people I know. Or maybe.

11:39.110 --> 11:40.280
Ow!

11:40.320 --> 11:41.280
Des.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.490
My knee.

11:42.530 --> 11:44.240
Ow! My arm. I'm sorry

11:47.660 --> 11:49.870
-Hello!
-Hello!

11:49.910 --> 11:50.920
Ow.

11:58.670 --> 12:00.260
Miss Katie.

12:02.130 --> 12:04.350
Looks like our Janel is a Katie.

12:05.680 --> 12:06.680
Either way, this is definitely
the same woman.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.730
Or she has a twin.
Twins are awesome.

12:12.140 --> 12:14.230
I don't get it. Did she fake her
own death? Or what?

12:14.270 --> 12:16.230
Well, if she faked her own death
to get away from our client...

12:16.270 --> 12:17.730
Are we sure we want to tell him
that she's alive?

12:18.320 --> 12:19.570
I don't know.

12:23.860 --> 12:24.740
What's this?

12:26.160 --> 12:27.530
Oh, if you're going to make some
tea, I'll have some

12:27.580 --> 12:29.870
English Breakfast with five
fresh milk -- no sugar.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.000
-Des.
-Wha?

12:31.040 --> 12:32.290
-Shut up.
-Okay.

12:35.710 --> 12:37.460
Ah... how'd you know
how to do that?

12:37.500 --> 12:40.010
Dad used to stash the booze
in a cabinet like this

12:40.050 --> 12:41.420
when we were young.

12:42.590 --> 12:44.090
Cool.

12:49.010 --> 12:51.100
This is definitely Janel.

12:52.680 --> 12:53.730
How fast can you get into that?

12:53.770 --> 12:55.140
Ah, this fast?

12:55.190 --> 12:57.650
She doesn't have a password
so I just turned it on...

12:57.690 --> 13:00.400
There's an encrypted file.
Let me see what I can do.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.070
Katie?

13:02.820 --> 13:04.160
It's me.

13:05.070 --> 13:05.990
Katie?

13:08.030 --> 13:09.540
Katie?

13:11.580 --> 13:12.830
Hello?

13:31.270 --> 13:32.470
Son of a...

13:35.690 --> 13:38.020
We better get out of here before
he comes back.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.780
Unless you're planning on making
breakfast first.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.360
Nope, I just got your back, bro.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.900
Family is super important.
Don't you agree?

13:45.950 --> 13:48.070
That guy had a gun.
Who was he?

13:48.110 --> 13:50.870
This is a really wicked pan,
though. It's a good weight.

13:51.620 --> 13:51.740
Whoa, Janel. Wait, wait.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.410
Listen. I need to talk to you,
okay, we're here --

13:55.460 --> 13:56.370
I know why you're here.

13:56.410 --> 13:57.420
Is that Bear spray?

13:57.460 --> 13:59.750
Ah! Arrrh!

14:00.210 --> 14:01.380
[thunk]

14:02.500 --> 14:05.550
Jake! Jake!
I think I got them. Jake?

14:14.270 --> 14:15.560
No use, hombre.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.810
Janel tied them super tight.

14:16.850 --> 14:18.020
Nice stuff, actually.

14:18.650 --> 14:19.770
What happened?

14:19.810 --> 14:21.440
Well, after Janel
bear sprayed us,

14:21.480 --> 14:23.190
she totally whacked us
with something.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.440
I can't remember. It was so fast
I can't remember.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.650
Where's Janel now?

14:27.150 --> 14:28.320
Over here.

14:29.610 --> 14:31.570
And I didn't whack you with
anything --

14:31.620 --> 14:33.410
Hi, Janel! You look like
you can really cook.

14:33.450 --> 14:34.330
I'm looking forward to the meal.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.580
I know you're here to kill me.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.620
Uh, I'm not here
to kill you --

14:38.660 --> 14:40.250
Well you have a pretty funny way
of showing it.

14:40.290 --> 14:42.380
With all due respect -- I'm the
one who was knocked unconscious,

14:42.420 --> 14:47.090
was bear sprayed and I'm
currently taped to your table.

14:47.130 --> 14:48.760
What are you doing here?

14:48.800 --> 14:50.840
Start talking before I cut up
your little friend.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.930
Shouldn't you clean that first?
You were cutting vegetables --

14:52.970 --> 14:54.220
[door bell]

14:56.100 --> 14:57.930
Do not move or say anything

14:57.980 --> 14:59.190
or I swear to God
this will be a lot

14:59.230 --> 15:00.850
more painful
than it needs to be.

15:02.270 --> 15:04.770
Des. We gotta get
the hell outa here -- now.

15:04.820 --> 15:08.240
Right, a plan.
Or we can wait for backup.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.820
The kids will be dropping off
the parents in the next 24 hours

15:09.860 --> 15:10.990
or the parents and the kids...

15:11.030 --> 15:12.530
Des, use the element
on the stove

15:12.570 --> 15:14.410
to burn through your restraints.

15:14.450 --> 15:15.790
Sorry, a little gun shy.

15:15.830 --> 15:17.500
Okay, buddy I know, I know.

15:17.540 --> 15:21.210
But trust me, okay. I believe in
you. You can do this.

15:21.250 --> 15:21.960
Well, isn't bear spray
flammable?

15:22.000 --> 15:23.290
I'm like covered in it.

15:23.330 --> 15:26.420
The bear spray is not flammable.
The propellant is.

15:26.460 --> 15:29.760
Right. Right.
Of course. Stupid me.

15:35.010 --> 15:36.470
Oh, it's getting' hot Jake.

15:36.510 --> 15:38.020
Jeez, she must have
tied these really tight.

15:38.060 --> 15:39.640
I can really feel the burn.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.440
-Des.
-Wha?

15:41.480 --> 15:42.650
Arrgh!!

15:44.440 --> 15:44.900
Des! Stop running! Stop running!

15:46.360 --> 15:48.360
I thought you said it wasn't
flammable! I'm on fire!

15:48.400 --> 15:50.190
It's not flammable.
The clothes are --

15:50.240 --> 15:52.990
clothes are flammable, Des!
Stop running!

15:53.030 --> 15:55.450
No, no, I gotta stop,
drop and run! --

15:55.490 --> 15:57.450
Or is it -- roll? Should I run?

15:57.490 --> 15:58.540
Shushhhh.

15:58.580 --> 15:59.580
[whispering]
Should I roll?

16:00.500 --> 16:01.290
Des!

16:02.210 --> 16:04.290
Oh, I'm on fire, I'm on fire.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.750
Okay. Okay.
Just close your eyes.

16:13.090 --> 16:14.930
Oh my god.
What are they doing here?

16:15.970 --> 16:17.010
What in the hell
is going on here!?

16:17.060 --> 16:18.270
I have no idea --

16:18.310 --> 16:19.350
[thud]

16:19.980 --> 16:21.640
Da da da da da.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.400
I think it's time that you
and I had a little chat.

16:30.070 --> 16:31.440
Des. What are you doing?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.320
You're making him look creepy.
Knock it off.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.410
I just want to make sure that
he's comfortable, b'y.

16:35.450 --> 16:37.030
Oh man, Tinny's gonna kill me.
She just bought me this...

16:38.490 --> 16:40.750
Do you mind explaining why you
faked your own death?

16:40.790 --> 16:41.950
Who was it that hired
you to kill me?

16:42.000 --> 16:44.420
Why do you think we're here
to kill you?

16:44.460 --> 16:45.540
Because you are
trying to kill me.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.920
Does he look like an assassin's
apprentice to you?

16:51.720 --> 16:53.220
Good point.

16:53.260 --> 16:55.050
Well, how about you
put down your gun

16:55.090 --> 16:57.640
and we'll talk all about it?

16:57.680 --> 17:00.680
Heh, heh, heh. See I get this
weird feeling if I let my guard

17:00.720 --> 17:04.060
down around you, you'll knock me
out with a frying pan again.

17:04.100 --> 17:05.690
I never knocked you out with --

17:05.730 --> 17:07.560
Ah, how 'bout we have some of
those freshly cut up vegetable.

17:07.610 --> 17:08.230
It would be a sin to waste 'em.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.610
Jake, don't listen to her, okay?
[phone ringing]

17:11.650 --> 17:14.150
She's trying a little divide and
conquer technique.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.610
You are a strange little man.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.280
Well, surely I can.
If I have to be.

17:19.950 --> 17:21.330
Yeah?

17:21.370 --> 17:21.700
Where you been? Why aren't you
answering your phone?

17:23.290 --> 17:26.000
Well, I got good news. Janel's
alive. But it's complicated.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.290
What are we dealing with?

17:28.330 --> 17:31.380
Besides the fact that I think
this Bradley guy is a real knob?

17:31.420 --> 17:34.510
Well, the knob's not dead wife
has a new boyfriend who's

17:34.550 --> 17:36.050
unconscious right
in front of me.

17:36.090 --> 17:37.590
[Mal] Good for her.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.350
Not sure how Bradley will react.
Where are you?

17:40.140 --> 17:41.060
I'm at Janel's daycare.

17:42.180 --> 17:44.390
Rose, can I bother you
for a tissue?

17:44.430 --> 17:45.810
Oh, yes. Of course. Sit tight.

17:47.060 --> 17:49.650
[Mal] So, where?
And Janel is there with you.

17:49.690 --> 17:51.730
Yes, I'm at Janel's
daycare with Janel.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.150
Got it.

17:53.190 --> 17:55.200
Listen. I'll take a few photos
of the new boyfriend

17:55.240 --> 17:56.360
and send them to you.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.610
I'll get Rose to check into it.

18:00.990 --> 18:01.910
-Des!
-Yeah?

18:01.950 --> 18:02.870
Have you found anything?

18:02.910 --> 18:04.330
No, I haven't checked yet.

18:04.370 --> 18:06.790
I want to make sure his head's
at the right angle and...

18:06.830 --> 18:07.830
there's that's good.

18:09.670 --> 18:10.710
Oh.

18:12.170 --> 18:13.840
US Marshal? Oh boy.

18:18.840 --> 18:20.300
You're in witness protection?

18:20.350 --> 18:20.390
Yup.

18:21.890 --> 18:23.720
And the Law doesn't usually like
to be knocked out with

18:23.770 --> 18:25.890
a fire extinguisher.

18:27.730 --> 18:30.310
We found Janel. Your wife.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.650
Really? Fantastic. Where is she?

18:33.690 --> 18:34.900
I know you're
anxious to see her,

18:34.940 --> 18:36.900
but we need to figure a few
things out first.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.320
Ah, ah, ah...

18:38.360 --> 18:39.860
Are you okay?

18:39.910 --> 18:41.910
Stress makes my allergies worse.

18:45.410 --> 18:47.000
Oh, sorry.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.870
Just a little overwhelming to
find out that she's alive after

18:49.920 --> 18:53.170
all of this time --
I need to go lie down.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.920
Of course. You can lie down in
the living room.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.090
No, no no. I'll make it.

19:01.760 --> 19:05.930
Jake says Janel's with another
man. If Bradley finds out,

19:05.970 --> 19:08.060
it'll send him into a sneezy
panic attack.

19:08.100 --> 19:10.770
Oh, we'd better check into this
before we let Bradley see her.

19:13.690 --> 19:15.530
[Des] Not good. If we get
arrested, that means we're gonna

19:15.570 --> 19:16.780
go to American Jail.

19:16.820 --> 19:19.150
Which means we're gonna need
dual citizenship.

19:21.110 --> 19:21.820
What did you do to land yourself
into witness protection?

19:23.450 --> 19:26.750
Okay. If you don't know that,
truly, what's your play here?

19:27.660 --> 19:29.620
Why are you tracking me down?

19:29.660 --> 19:30.710
I'm a private detective.

19:30.750 --> 19:32.250
We both are.

19:32.290 --> 19:35.670
And I was hired by your husband,
Bradley, to track you down.

19:36.460 --> 19:38.670
I don't have a husband.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.340
What have you done?

19:50.520 --> 19:54.480
Well well well. So this is the
cadet I'm supposed to meet.

19:54.520 --> 19:58.280
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
the last time I saw you face,

19:58.320 --> 20:00.110
I do believe I was
kidnapping it,

20:00.150 --> 20:03.030
am I right or am I right?

20:06.030 --> 20:08.540
This is seriously perverse
stuff, little girl.

20:08.580 --> 20:09.910
It's perverse even for me.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.790
Now what do you want from me,
exactly?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.880
These meetings are part of my
training.

20:16.840 --> 20:17.880
Interviewing convicts

20:17.920 --> 20:19.510
and getting experience
talking to them.

20:19.550 --> 20:21.630
Right. Yeah.
I did the exact same exercise

20:21.670 --> 20:23.180
when I was a cadet.

20:23.220 --> 20:24.470
Good. So you get it.

20:24.510 --> 20:27.720
No, not really,
'cause as I recall,

20:27.760 --> 20:30.430
the cadet gets to choose
whatever convict they like.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.640
So?

20:31.680 --> 20:33.850
So you picked me?
The man who kidnapped you?

20:33.900 --> 20:36.020
It's a bit odd, no?

20:36.060 --> 20:38.320
I ask the questions here.
Not the other way around.

20:39.190 --> 20:41.280
Forgive me for overstepping.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.530
Are you gonna play nice?

20:42.570 --> 20:44.700
Are you gonna drop
that snotty tone?

20:44.740 --> 20:47.160
If I leave, we both know that
the best conversation you're

20:47.200 --> 20:49.160
gonna have today is with your
homicidal bunkmate.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.410
Must be riveting stuff.

20:51.450 --> 20:52.660
Well, don't knock it.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.170
I derive a great deal of joy

20:54.210 --> 20:56.670
from my chats
with Mister Shamrock.

20:59.460 --> 21:00.960
Okay tough girl.
What's your name?

21:01.380 --> 21:02.510
Tinny.

21:03.010 --> 21:03.930
Doyle.

21:03.970 --> 21:05.510
Jake's niece. Real name Katrina.

21:05.550 --> 21:06.590
Tinny.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.970
Okay, Tinny.
What do you want to know?

21:10.970 --> 21:12.600
Start with your family.

21:14.480 --> 21:17.770
I got two sisters. I've a dead-
beat dad, well did, he's dead.

21:17.810 --> 21:20.270
My mother is a saint.

21:20.320 --> 21:22.240
I've never been married and I
have no children.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.900
How's that for a start?

21:26.530 --> 21:28.700
What is it?
Is it something I said, sport?

21:28.740 --> 21:31.330
I'm trying to answer your
questions. I mean, maybe it's

21:31.370 --> 21:34.870
being face to face with me
that's sort of throwing you.

21:37.080 --> 21:40.670
You know, the kidnapping thing
was nothing personal.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.760
I'll come back.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.050
This was just a screening,
so...

21:48.090 --> 21:49.220
bye.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.570
Katrina?

22:01.610 --> 22:02.980
Monica.
Constable Hayward.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.110
What are you doing here?

22:05.150 --> 22:07.070
Research on convicts.

22:07.110 --> 22:11.160
I see. I'm talking to a C.I.
myself. Don't worry.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.290
It get's easier.

22:14.330 --> 22:16.370
Hey, you're grandfather was
asking about

22:16.410 --> 22:19.170
a woman's police records.
You know about that?

22:19.210 --> 22:20.710
No. They don't tell me about
their cases.

22:20.750 --> 22:23.300
Well they should know they can
come to me for help.

22:23.340 --> 22:26.010
- You too.
-Thanks.

22:36.520 --> 22:37.730
He's not upstairs.

22:37.770 --> 22:39.810
He moves fast
for a fella with bad balance.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.150
He's got my notepad --

22:43.190 --> 22:45.240
with the address of
where Jake's got Janel.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.240
Call Jake!

22:47.240 --> 22:49.660
I've never been married.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.660
[phone rings]
What's the next lie?

22:51.490 --> 22:54.080
Why are you guys after me?

22:54.490 --> 22:55.370
Achoo!

22:56.500 --> 22:59.000
Get down! [gunshot]

23:00.960 --> 23:02.920
I'll get Janel outa here.

23:02.960 --> 23:03.920
Achoo.

23:06.590 --> 23:07.970
Who the hell are you?

23:08.010 --> 23:12.090
Listen, if you're after Janel,
pal, there's a long line

23:12.140 --> 23:13.810
of people and it starts way --

23:13.850 --> 23:15.180
[click]

23:15.220 --> 23:16.600
Run!

23:18.520 --> 23:19.600
Where is she?

23:19.640 --> 23:21.770
I don't know. Achoo.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.190
[punch] [thud]

23:26.570 --> 23:27.570
Over here.

23:33.030 --> 23:33.910
Where's John?

23:34.990 --> 23:35.950
You left John?

23:35.990 --> 23:37.620
Yeah, but a new
friend showed up.

23:37.660 --> 23:39.790
Okay, so not only did you knock
out a federal officer, you left

23:39.830 --> 23:41.920
him with two madmen
and he got kidnapped?

23:41.960 --> 23:43.960
Not our best moment. But on the
plus side, we still have you.

23:45.590 --> 23:48.460
Bradley wasn't after you, but
our new friend definitely was.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.760
I need you to start telling me
the truth. Right now.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.310
So is the reason you're in
witness protection because

24:00.350 --> 24:03.850
you've seen unspeakable things
that no one should have?

24:03.900 --> 24:06.070
And if so,
can you speak of them?

24:06.980 --> 24:09.360
The marshal,
John McGarry.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.200
He's been in the US Marshal
Service for twenty years.

24:12.240 --> 24:13.740
So Bradley wasn't after you.

24:13.780 --> 24:15.620
He was after some Federal
Marshal? You wanna start

24:15.660 --> 24:17.160
being straight with us?

24:17.200 --> 24:20.370
Why should I? I'm not the one
who led a hit man to someone

24:20.410 --> 24:21.620
in witness protection
and at the same time

24:21.660 --> 24:24.330
got her handler kidnapped.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.250
Have you ever seen
Bradley before?

24:26.290 --> 24:29.170
No. Bradley was
posing as my husband

24:29.210 --> 24:31.260
to get to John obviously.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.930
And you have no idea why?

24:32.970 --> 24:34.640
Ah, ah, ah. I have a hypothesis

24:34.680 --> 24:36.010
that I think
is fairer than fair.

24:36.050 --> 24:37.550
-Des?
-Shutting.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.220
This other guy -- this Sheen
Barry -- he is following you.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.640
Sheen works for the people I
testified against.

24:43.770 --> 24:44.440
He is a killer.

24:45.860 --> 24:49.610
This Bradley guy -- honestly --
I have no idea why

24:49.650 --> 24:50.820
he'd be after John.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.990
We have to help him. Please.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.580
I can pay you to get John back.
I have money.

24:57.620 --> 24:58.740
I just -- I can't do it alone.

24:59.870 --> 25:02.620
John's not just your handler,
is he?

25:05.380 --> 25:06.670
We're together.

25:08.000 --> 25:08.500
We've been lovers for a while,

25:09.880 --> 25:12.760
but if the police find out,
they'll separate us.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.010
Nobody knows about us.

25:16.050 --> 25:17.930
We were gonna run away together
just disappear.

25:19.220 --> 25:22.140
We were just waiting for
the time to be right.

25:22.890 --> 25:24.480
Well, that's just great.

25:24.520 --> 25:28.360
Please, find him before it's too
late.

25:28.980 --> 25:30.440
Will you help me?

25:30.480 --> 25:31.980
Like we have a choice.

25:32.030 --> 25:33.070
It was Jake's fault John got
kidnapped in the first place.

25:34.280 --> 25:37.320
Whatever. Listen.
I'll go talk to the cops.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.280
See if I can get some help
without letting them know that

25:39.320 --> 25:40.990
I need their help.
Rose, you want to come with?

25:42.200 --> 25:44.620
Good call.
I'll keep an eye on these two.

25:44.660 --> 25:45.330
Call me if anything happens.

25:45.870 --> 25:47.130
You got it.

25:53.630 --> 25:55.510
[Hood] Thanks inspector.
We'll keep you posted.

26:04.270 --> 26:06.270
They think you're too deep.

26:06.310 --> 26:07.650
You get the feeling they wanna
pull you out?

26:08.610 --> 26:09.110
Maybe.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.980
Look, I'm telling you.
I'm in good with Taylor.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.780
It's only a matter of time
before he tells me

26:14.820 --> 26:16.700
who the real supplier is.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.780
In the meantime...

26:21.080 --> 26:22.540
he's looking to sell more.

26:23.330 --> 26:25.290
More drugs on the street.

26:25.330 --> 26:27.160
I tell you,
this oil money is bringing

26:27.210 --> 26:29.540
more trouble than it's worth.

26:33.750 --> 26:35.130
Watch yourself, Bennett.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.930
I'm here if you need me, okay?

26:40.890 --> 26:42.100
See you later, pig.

26:46.180 --> 26:47.940
Everything okay, Jake?

26:47.980 --> 26:49.020
What do you want?

26:49.060 --> 26:51.480
Was that -- was that Leslie?

26:51.520 --> 26:54.230
What can I do for you Doyles
this time? And I'd like to point

26:54.270 --> 26:56.150
out that the favors are adding
up and I haven't come close

26:56.190 --> 26:57.570
to cashing in these chips.

26:57.610 --> 27:00.490
I'm happy to pay you back, you
know, by having you over

27:00.530 --> 27:05.700
to my bar, which I own,
and buying you a drink.

27:05.740 --> 27:08.290
If you own it, it's not really
buying me one, is it?

27:08.330 --> 27:09.960
Good point.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.840
Um, okay, I do need a favor,
and I can't tell you details,

27:14.880 --> 27:16.880
and you're not allowed to ask me
but I can tell you that it's

27:16.920 --> 27:18.760
very, very, very important.

27:19.880 --> 27:21.180
Who's this?

27:21.220 --> 27:23.350
Ah, that's part of the favor.
His name is Sheen.

27:23.390 --> 27:24.760
We need a little info on him,

27:24.810 --> 27:25.470
if you could do a background
check, maybe?

27:26.600 --> 27:28.140
Okay. This will
just take a minute.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.310
What's the rest of the favor?

27:29.350 --> 27:30.850
[phone ringing] Um...

27:33.230 --> 27:36.940
I'm sorry.
I have to take this. Hello?

27:36.980 --> 27:38.530
Ah, you get used to it.

27:38.570 --> 27:39.490
Bradley.

27:39.530 --> 27:40.860
Achoo!

27:40.900 --> 27:43.370
Bradley, where are you and where
do you have John?

27:44.370 --> 27:45.870
Sorry, allergies
still really bad.

27:46.870 --> 27:48.790
Hey, did you cash
that cheque yet?

27:48.830 --> 27:50.750
No. For some reason, I've been
kind of busy. I wonder why.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.500
It's a good cheque.
And guess what?

27:54.540 --> 27:58.300
I have to hire you for another
case. This one's a bit easier.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.720
The pay's not as good though.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.680
[muffled]

28:04.590 --> 28:07.470
Listen. I don't have a lot of
time for small talk right now.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.720
What do you want?

28:08.770 --> 28:11.640
John has a list -- had --
and now you have it.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.560
Get it to me or he dies. Simple.

28:13.600 --> 28:16.150
Uh, okay. Except that I have no
idea what the hell

28:16.190 --> 28:17.650
you're talking about. What list?

28:17.690 --> 28:18.990
Don't do anything stupid.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.490
Talking to cops gets him killed.

28:22.530 --> 28:24.780
Mr. Doyle,
I don't have all day.

28:26.740 --> 28:29.040
Right. Sorry. A friend of mine
had daycare troubles.

28:30.370 --> 28:32.160
So, what did you find out about
our man Sheen?

28:32.210 --> 28:34.210
-Impatient, aren't we?
-Yup.

28:34.250 --> 28:38.210
Sheen Barry. Enforcer for some
US Coyotes. He's a bad guy Jake.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.840
People smugglers.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.800
They help sneak people into the
United States, and this guy --

28:43.260 --> 28:45.390
he's our enforcer. Suspect for
numerous disappearances.

28:46.930 --> 28:49.020
He's a killer, Jake. I hope you
know what you're doing.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.520
Yeah, me too.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.680
What's the rest of the favor?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.190
No there is no other favor.

28:53.230 --> 28:54.900
I just want to thank you for
everything you've done.

28:56.150 --> 28:58.400
What are you doing?
We need info on Bradley.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.900
We got a bigger problem now.

29:06.700 --> 29:08.620
Why are you digging
into my past?

29:08.660 --> 29:10.200
I'm not just some snoop.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.000
I have to make sure I don't miss
anything while I'm in the middle

29:12.040 --> 29:12.500
of an investigation.

29:13.790 --> 29:15.750
What kind of trouble are we in
with this guy?

29:15.790 --> 29:16.750
A lot.

29:16.790 --> 29:19.050
[phone ringing]

29:21.050 --> 29:22.300
[Jake] Dad. Listen to me.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.300
This Sheen guy's
the real deal, alright?

29:24.340 --> 29:25.510
I know we don't like
to use guns,

29:26.430 --> 29:27.760
but go downstairs, in the bar,

29:27.800 --> 29:28.470
and grab the shotgun, okay?
Right away.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.180
You know what the worst part of
this is? I picked the client

29:32.220 --> 29:35.310
that got us into this mess,
not you. It's killing me.

29:35.350 --> 29:37.480
Yeah, just hurry up, okay? Bye.

29:38.810 --> 29:41.110
I gotta step out for a moment.
Keep a sharp eye.

29:43.400 --> 29:46.700
So, I guess it's
just you and me.

29:46.740 --> 29:47.910
And me.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.660
Sheen. What are you doing here?

29:51.830 --> 29:53.710
What do you think
I'm doing here, Janel?

30:04.420 --> 30:05.470
Aghh.

30:05.510 --> 30:06.800
Ugh!

30:08.590 --> 30:09.890
[punch]

30:11.180 --> 30:13.560
[Des] Oh, I'm going to
throw up in my mouth.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.890
You might want to curb that
killer instinct of yours.

30:16.390 --> 30:16.440
Ugh!

30:17.810 --> 30:20.110
-Oh! Knock it off!
-Guys! Oh my god. Oh my god.

30:20.150 --> 30:20.900
You pissed a lot of people off,

30:21.980 --> 30:23.400
testifying against
them like that.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.490
They deserved it.

30:24.530 --> 30:25.610
Oh yeah?

30:28.990 --> 30:29.950
[Des] Aaah!

30:29.990 --> 30:30.870
Des.

30:34.450 --> 30:36.040
[Janel] I helped smuggle
people into America

30:36.080 --> 30:37.920
to give them a better life.

30:37.960 --> 30:40.170
You ruined -- abused them!

30:43.550 --> 30:48.340
Now, I don't wanna kill you just
yet, but one of these bullets

30:48.380 --> 30:50.300
will slow you down considerably.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.850
I've got money.

30:56.890 --> 30:57.850
Good for you.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.600
You can have it.
Just let me go.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.690
It's back at my place.
I can take you there.

31:03.480 --> 31:05.400
Good. Just one thing --

31:05.440 --> 31:07.570
Okay. Looks like you guys got
this all worked out,

31:07.610 --> 31:09.450
so I'll probably just get out of
your hair.

31:09.490 --> 31:11.740
No -- oh no, please,
not again. Ugh!

31:14.450 --> 31:15.620
Was that really necessary?

31:18.710 --> 31:20.120
Hey!

31:21.080 --> 31:21.880
Uggh.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.920
Des? Des?

31:25.340 --> 31:26.340
Uuuh.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.300
Oh, Des. Are you okay?

31:32.220 --> 31:34.050
Twice. He hit me twice. Twice!

31:34.100 --> 31:35.270
I know that you've had a rough
time today but you gotta try

31:36.430 --> 31:37.930
to piece this together.
What happened?

31:37.980 --> 31:39.850
Ah, yes.
I knows, I knows,

31:39.890 --> 31:41.650
but I can't remember what
I knows, you know?

31:41.690 --> 31:43.190
Sheen showed up. Grabbed Janel.

31:43.230 --> 31:46.360
So we're screwed. Sheen has
Janel and Bradley's gonna kill

31:46.400 --> 31:49.490
the marshal if we don't deliver
him some stupid list he wants.

31:49.530 --> 31:50.950
What list?
What are we talking about.

31:50.990 --> 31:52.860
List! List! List! Yes!
I knows about a list too.

31:52.910 --> 31:54.240
I emailed myself the encrypted
file from Janel's computer.

31:55.660 --> 31:57.910
I only got half of it
but it was a list of names.

31:58.410 --> 31:59.580
Ah! [thud]

32:02.580 --> 32:03.580
[Jake] Whoa.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.000
I know what this is.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.010
These people -- they're all in
witness protection.

32:09.050 --> 32:10.550
This is a list of John's
protectees.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.640
I'm guessing the full version
has their new identities

32:12.680 --> 32:14.180
and addresses.

32:14.220 --> 32:16.430
If that list gets into the wrong
hands, a lot of angry people

32:16.470 --> 32:16.970
can get some serious revenge.

32:17.890 --> 32:19.810
Bradley cannot get hold of this.

32:19.850 --> 32:20.940
-Des?
-Yes!

32:22.440 --> 32:25.230
Do you think that you can track
this number for me? Des?

32:25.860 --> 32:26.900
-Des?
-Yeah?

32:26.940 --> 32:28.230
Do you think you can do that?

32:28.280 --> 32:31.200
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Give me a minute.

32:32.070 --> 32:34.240
Okay. Des?
Listen to me.

32:34.280 --> 32:35.910
Did Sheen say where he was
taking Janel?

32:37.120 --> 32:40.080
Did Sheen say where
he was taking Janel?

32:40.120 --> 32:41.500
He's headed to the daycare

32:41.540 --> 32:44.870
and she promised him cash.
It might not be too late.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.920
Alright. Dad, if Des manages to
track that number,

32:47.960 --> 32:51.050
you go free John.
I gotta go help Janel.

32:51.090 --> 32:52.180
Son, wait.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.300
No, I'm good.

32:57.930 --> 33:01.480
Uhm. Okay. Yeah, okay I got it.
He's at a building downtown.

33:01.520 --> 33:03.980
Great.
Can we have an address, honey?

33:04.020 --> 33:05.980
Uhhh just a minute.

33:06.020 --> 33:10.530
Bradley, it's me. I got your
list. We gotta meet.

33:12.740 --> 33:13.950
Where's this money?

33:13.990 --> 33:16.240
Half a million. Cash.

33:18.070 --> 33:21.750
Ah ah ah. No funny business like
pulling a gun out of there.

33:22.370 --> 33:24.120
Back up.

33:30.590 --> 33:32.130
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
You still got it Janel.

33:32.170 --> 33:35.590
I thought you might have lost
your edge. Most dangerous Coyote

33:35.630 --> 33:38.050
I know -- runs a daycare?

33:38.930 --> 33:40.390
You got your money.

33:40.430 --> 33:41.140
Leave.

33:41.180 --> 33:42.390
I wish.

33:42.430 --> 33:44.810
But then the Coyotes would
come after me too.

34:23.930 --> 34:28.770
-Wait. Wait. I lied.
-What about?

34:28.810 --> 34:31.650
It's not the full amount.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.780
I have another stash.

34:33.820 --> 34:35.240
Where's the rest of it?

34:35.280 --> 34:36.320
Promise you won't shoot me.

34:37.030 --> 34:38.320
Oh sure. No problem.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.920
Now Doll, this is the end.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.250
[door bell]

34:54.300 --> 34:56.130
It's probably a parent.

34:56.170 --> 34:57.220
One false move and you're dead.

34:57.260 --> 34:58.720
Just be cool.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.930
Whoever this is has nothing to
do with any of this, okay?

35:00.970 --> 35:02.350
Let's hope you're right.

35:09.310 --> 35:10.560
There's no one here.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.610
What? What's going on here?

35:18.860 --> 35:20.570
Huh!

35:26.790 --> 35:28.540
[spray] Arrgh!

35:29.170 --> 35:30.290
Sorry about this!

35:30.330 --> 35:32.460
[bonk] Argh. [thump]

35:33.880 --> 35:36.250
That smile on your face is
slightly disconcerting.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.470
Come on. We gotta find John
before it's too late.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.220
-You got my list?
-What list?

35:44.260 --> 35:45.520
Where's John?
What did you do to him?

35:46.220 --> 35:47.680
He's fine and safe.

35:47.720 --> 35:50.020
He'll stay that way as long as I
get John's list.

35:51.650 --> 35:56.110
The list of all his protectees.
Their old and new identities

35:56.150 --> 35:56.980
and where they're living --

35:58.070 --> 36:01.410
ah ah ah --
and drop the frying pan.

36:03.910 --> 36:06.200
I'll take you to your list,
alright. Just calm down.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.200
Follow me.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.160
Now.

36:11.790 --> 36:13.710
So... What are you
gonna do with this list?

36:15.130 --> 36:18.300
I'm gonna sell each name and
location, one by one,

36:18.340 --> 36:20.880
to the wronged parties.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.180
I'm gonna make a mint.
A lot of money in revenge.

36:23.220 --> 36:25.390
So the system works. Great.

36:28.970 --> 36:31.810
Easy there. I'm not interested
in any bear spray tricks.

36:32.560 --> 36:33.940
Just give me
the list.

36:33.980 --> 36:36.320
This is where she got the list
stashed, alright? Relax.

36:46.740 --> 36:48.490
It's on this hard drive.

36:49.580 --> 36:50.660
Back off.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.040
Here we go.

36:58.380 --> 36:59.800
I'd drop that if I was you.

37:01.050 --> 37:03.130
I'm a real good shot
when I'm not tied up.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.300
I'd do what he says.

37:05.340 --> 37:07.850
He's had a long time to think
about what to do with you.

37:07.890 --> 37:09.140
John, honey, are you okay?

37:09.180 --> 37:09.470
Never better.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.350
Let's see how
good a shot you are

37:12.390 --> 37:14.480
with your girlfriend
on the line.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.850
Do it.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.270
Or not.

37:19.230 --> 37:20.110
[punch]

37:22.070 --> 37:24.610
I told you I didn't like
that guy. Job well done.

37:24.650 --> 37:28.240
Yeah.
Where are the love birds?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.370
Hey! Any luck?

37:33.410 --> 37:37.330
Well. It's official.
John and Janel have vanished.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.590
Not before they took all of the
savings out of the house too.

37:39.630 --> 37:41.380
-Pint?
-Yup.

37:41.420 --> 37:43.630
Hey, I was talking to a friend
of mine with the Crown.

37:43.670 --> 37:45.680
Bradley and Sheen have already
been charged and they're going

37:45.720 --> 37:47.220
to serve long prison sentences.

37:47.260 --> 37:49.180
That's great. But we should
probably cash that cheque from

37:49.220 --> 37:51.220
Bradley sooner
rather than later.

37:51.260 --> 37:52.890
I already tried. It bounced.

37:52.930 --> 37:55.850
See. Can we at least write this
whole case off as some sort of,

37:55.890 --> 37:57.440
like, charity thing, or --

37:57.480 --> 37:58.860
Afraid not.

37:58.900 --> 38:00.780
This was left at
the bar for you.

38:02.900 --> 38:03.530
Whoa.

38:04.860 --> 38:08.410
It's from John and Janel.
They've run off together

38:08.450 --> 38:10.330
but they decided to leave us
this little gift.

38:11.580 --> 38:14.040
Not a bad day's work.
Supper to celebrate?

38:14.080 --> 38:16.080
Uh. I'll have to catch up.

38:16.120 --> 38:19.080
You weren't invited. You're on.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.170
I'll go get my coat.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.010
Malachy? Hi.

38:28.390 --> 38:32.600
So, this is the bar, hey?
I'm kind of owed a drink.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.770
Ah, so you're
looking for Jake then.

38:34.810 --> 38:36.600
Yes I am.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.650
He left me with two fugitives
today, with a ton of evidence.

38:38.690 --> 38:40.690
So I figure the first
round's on me.

38:40.730 --> 38:42.230
Well, you just missed him.

38:42.270 --> 38:44.650
But I'll pass on the message.

38:46.650 --> 38:48.030
Anything else?

38:48.070 --> 38:50.660
No. That's all.

38:54.410 --> 38:56.460
Who was that?

38:56.500 --> 38:57.960
Trouble.

38:59.580 --> 39:01.590
Oh my god. You look terrible.
What happened to your shirt?

39:02.710 --> 39:04.130
Well, I got good news
and bad news.

39:04.920 --> 39:06.960
The bad news is I got lit

39:07.010 --> 39:09.510
on fire and that nice shirt you
bought me is ruined.

39:10.390 --> 39:11.600
Okay. What's the good news?

39:11.640 --> 39:12.850
I also got bear sprayed,

39:12.890 --> 39:13.890
nailed in the head twice
and knocked unconscious.

39:15.310 --> 39:18.310
And I also hit Jake in the head
with a frying pan.

39:19.650 --> 39:21.650
You didn't tell him about
Crocker though, did you?

39:21.690 --> 39:27.070
No Tinny, no! I didn't!
And ahhh! Ahh! I didn't.

39:28.240 --> 39:29.070
But maybe you should.

39:29.950 --> 39:29.990
I think Jake would understand.

39:31.620 --> 39:33.620
Maybe he could be helpful.
I find he can be super helpful.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.040
Yeah. Those hits on the head are
making you worse than normal.

39:39.330 --> 39:43.130
I just need to deal with this
on my own, okay?

39:43.960 --> 39:46.420
But, I did see him today.

39:46.840 --> 39:48.090
What?

39:48.130 --> 39:49.340
-- You what?

39:49.380 --> 39:50.260
Ah, I'm leaving.

39:51.930 --> 39:53.010
You saw him?

39:53.050 --> 39:56.470
Yeah. And I'm all
in one piece so...

40:00.640 --> 40:05.650
Tin, all I want is for you
to be safe, okay?

40:06.940 --> 40:08.400
So if this is something
that you need to do,

40:08.440 --> 40:10.530
then I'm not gonna
get in your way.

40:10.570 --> 40:11.280
-Good.
-But,

40:12.740 --> 40:16.540
be careful, because he's
charming, and he's brilliant,

40:18.080 --> 40:22.670
but also take everything that he
says with a grain of salt.

40:26.670 --> 40:28.800
I love you brat.

40:30.220 --> 40:31.260
Me too.

40:33.970 --> 40:35.100
I do.

40:46.860 --> 40:48.030
Hi.

40:51.320 --> 40:52.700
That's pretty cryptic.

40:52.740 --> 40:55.070
You texting me your
address like that.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.450
How'd you know it was mine?

40:57.240 --> 40:58.620
A fella can hope.

41:00.700 --> 41:02.540
Like what I've done
with the place?

41:02.580 --> 41:05.880
Yeah. Needs a hooked rug.
Maybe Des can make you one.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.290
He's taking a class.

41:08.670 --> 41:12.930
Leslie. Please tell me that
you're okay.

41:13.630 --> 41:15.550
I'm fine Jake.

41:16.050 --> 41:16.470
Just off.

41:18.100 --> 41:21.930
This undercover stuff is very
heavy. Alright? And no one --

41:23.520 --> 41:27.400
no one is going to think any
less of you, if you get out now.

41:28.150 --> 41:29.110
I'm fine.

41:29.940 --> 41:30.900
I am.

41:32.030 --> 41:35.700
The only problem is, I like it.

41:35.740 --> 41:37.370
This job.

41:38.120 --> 41:38.950
I'm kicking ass.

41:39.660 --> 41:41.040
I don't wanna stop.

41:43.540 --> 41:46.920
And ah, what's this I hear

41:46.960 --> 41:51.960
about you handing the new girl
easy collars?

41:52.010 --> 41:53.260
Um, Monika?

41:54.590 --> 42:01.430
Ahem, yeah, she's
very very hot. Why? You jealous?

42:05.480 --> 42:07.020
What do you think?

42:07.060 --> 42:10.110
I'm gonna go with a no.
But, I mean,

42:11.820 --> 42:14.240
it could be a...

42:16.150 --> 42:18.120
a yes?
