WEBVTT

00:26.871 --> 00:28.248
Thanks, Fikret.

00:48.143 --> 00:52.689
Hey, Ken! Just wanted to be on hand
to smooth and say welcome home.

00:52.689 --> 00:55.442
- Who are they?
- Additional manpower for the new role.

00:56.192 --> 00:59.279
Okay, welcome additional manpower.
They can fuck off until I need them.

01:01.072 --> 01:03.199
I just want to show my face,
check in with the grays,

01:03.199 --> 01:04.534
and then get to the plane.

01:04.534 --> 01:06.703
I'd rather have more time
on the other end, okay?

01:06.703 --> 01:10.540
Maybe I get in early and fucking
slip a Mickey in Matsson's meatballs.

01:11.082 --> 01:13.417
Okay, we'll make sure
the plane is ready to go.

01:16.296 --> 01:19.089
Before takeoff, might be nice
to get a shot of you and Roman,

01:19.089 --> 01:21.343
candid shot, stepping up,

01:21.343 --> 01:23.970
"CE-bros" is kind of the bad version.

01:24.554 --> 01:26.514
Shall we maybe
not do the bad version?

01:27.098 --> 01:28.557
Agreed.

01:41.029 --> 01:42.572
Thank you.

01:48.328 --> 01:49.703
Thank you.

01:50.789 --> 01:53.415
Thank you.
Got a knack for the theatrics.

01:53.957 --> 01:55.501
What about one of these?

01:55.876 --> 01:58.380
- You get any sleep?
- A little bit.

01:58.380 --> 02:00.214
Did you get the condolence assistance?

02:00.214 --> 02:01.633
Yeah, what do you think?

02:01.633 --> 02:04.218
Old guard loading us up
with human listening devices?

02:05.595 --> 02:08.890
Look at you fucking chumps.
This the Romey A team?

02:08.890 --> 02:10.391
- This is the team.
- What's shaking?

02:10.391 --> 02:12.101
You camp out overnight, I hear?

02:12.101 --> 02:14.604
I got here early, I'm just getting
briefed. Should I get Shiv?

02:15.021 --> 02:17.523
Bastian, could you get Shiv, please?

02:17.983 --> 02:21.736
Okay, so what's bubbling?
Short range top lines?

02:21.736 --> 02:24.114
Studio would like to schedule
a call this morning, red flag.

02:24.114 --> 02:27.491
We're okaying "Kalispitron"
reshoots, panicky vibes.

02:27.491 --> 02:31.036
Second producer signed off on leave,
citing mental collapse/overload.

02:32.497 --> 02:34.915
We okay it.
We're balls deep already.

02:34.915 --> 02:36.501
I think gotta keep spending.

02:36.501 --> 02:39.921
I will say no a lot and shout,
obviously, initially, but yeah.

02:39.921 --> 02:42.882
And you got my email
on Matsson angles, deal thoughts?

02:42.882 --> 02:44.968
Which one?
You sent several.

02:44.968 --> 02:47.428
The last one,
ignore previous emails.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.431
Yeah, great, thanks for putting me
through all that.

02:49.431 --> 02:52.559
We're good here, by the way, guys.
You can all fuck off, yeah.

02:52.559 --> 02:56.187
- Don't talk to my team, Hugo.
- So, talk on the plane?

02:56.645 --> 02:59.648
Well, here we go.
March of the Emperor Penguins.

03:01.316 --> 03:02.694
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:02.694 --> 03:04.654
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

03:05.029 --> 03:07.364
- Congrats.
- Nothing to celebrate, but...

03:07.364 --> 03:10.160
So what is this, you guys
are reinterviewing for your jobs?

03:10.160 --> 03:12.745
No, just a check-in pre-Norway.

03:12.745 --> 03:15.790
Okay, I think we did the check-in
on the board call

03:15.790 --> 03:19.544
and on the follow-up call
and with your 33 000 emails.

03:19.544 --> 03:22.463
Well, just anything we can do
to be helpful

03:22.463 --> 03:26.217
in terms of like dry running
the negotiation or...

03:26.217 --> 03:29.762
Okay, we trust you absolutely,
now tell us every single word

03:29.762 --> 03:31.513
you plan on saying to him.

03:31.513 --> 03:33.558
Look, we wanna knock
this out of the park.

03:33.558 --> 03:35.726
Squeeze an extra three,
four dollars a share.

03:35.726 --> 03:39.814
Rome and me. Shiv, on point
here to advise and liaise.

03:39.814 --> 03:43.776
Cool, yeah, did I miss the invite?
What's the conflab?

03:43.776 --> 03:45.904
Boomers versus zoomers?

03:45.904 --> 03:48.156
No, this is on schedule, Shiv.

03:48.156 --> 03:50.866
Mom and Dad just stopped by to
make sure we have food in the fridge.

03:50.866 --> 03:54.871
Okay, Matsson.
He's saying not to freak out.

03:54.871 --> 03:56.580
- What?
- Freak out, why?

03:56.580 --> 03:58.374
Why, is he wobbling?

03:58.833 --> 04:00.709
Did you all just get this?
Do you have this?

04:00.709 --> 04:04.339
They're asking for everyone.
They're requesting us all in Norway,

04:04.339 --> 04:07.716
plus division heads,
bunch of EVPs. I've forwarded.

04:07.716 --> 04:09.635
He actually sent a list of names.

04:09.635 --> 04:12.263
- So that's sinister as fuck.
- What is it, do we think?

04:12.263 --> 04:15.809
- Cultural compatibility check.
- It's early, but it is smart.

04:15.809 --> 04:19.729
But why check cultural compatibility
if we haven't done the deal?

04:19.729 --> 04:22.481
I guess because we are
probably doing the deal.

04:22.481 --> 04:25.944
- It's positive.
- Unless he's looking for a way out.

04:25.944 --> 04:27.529
Yeah, or invite everyone

04:27.529 --> 04:30.447
so he doesn't just have to deal
with the B-roll brothers.

04:30.447 --> 04:31.783
Can I have a look at this list?

04:31.783 --> 04:33.951
You should all have it,
you're on the list.

04:33.951 --> 04:35.577
No, you didn't send it to me.

04:36.413 --> 04:39.498
What does it look like if we say no?
We don't play that weak.

04:41.042 --> 04:44.879
I guess in the interest of doing
the deal that we all want,

04:44.879 --> 04:47.381
maybe we should play ball.

04:48.383 --> 04:51.720
Yeah, no, great, great, good.

04:53.387 --> 04:55.973
Let's go get the deal.
Let's bleed the Swede.

06:17.846 --> 06:19.848
SUCCESSION

06:27.565 --> 06:29.025
Sir, sir!

06:33.028 --> 06:37.574
Whirlwind, huh?
So why Norway, not Sweden?

06:37.574 --> 06:40.244
Annual retreat. Anyway, Norway,
Sweden, what's the difference?

06:40.244 --> 06:42.204
All descended from the same rapists.

06:42.204 --> 06:44.373
- Hello!
- How are you?

06:45.207 --> 06:51.088
Well, excited to get a feel
for Scandinavia and some hotties?

06:51.548 --> 06:52.715
The hotties.

06:52.715 --> 06:55.343
The arctic foxes,
bit of Norwegian wood.

06:55.343 --> 06:57.010
Greg, show some respect.

06:57.010 --> 06:59.471
It's not a trip to the Guggenheim, Greg.

06:59.930 --> 07:01.515
It's musical electric chairs.

07:01.515 --> 07:03.935
To see whether they like us
after the acquisition.

07:04.352 --> 07:08.355
Find out who they like, everyone
else, welcome to the lime pit.

07:09.314 --> 07:10.859
You're on the other plane,
by the way.

07:10.859 --> 07:12.610
Yeah, I know, thanks, Hugo.

07:12.985 --> 07:15.739
But you're not worried, right?

07:15.739 --> 07:17.197
Me? No.

07:17.865 --> 07:20.200
With the ATN carve out,
I'm not worried about Matsson.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.621
I'm worried about being whacked
by the cast of Bugsy Malone over there.

07:35.924 --> 07:39.012
- You got a problem, Tom?
- No.

07:55.820 --> 07:58.114
You guys are seriously
not concerned about this dad stuff?

07:58.114 --> 08:01.325
- Cuz there's been more.
- Sorry, I have to focus.

08:01.743 --> 08:04.661
Studio overages,
"Kalispitron: Hibernation".

08:04.661 --> 08:07.082
225 mil sunk cost.

08:07.082 --> 08:09.042
Estimating about three weeks
of reshoots,

08:09.042 --> 08:12.002
which is like 25 mil plus CGI.

08:12.629 --> 08:16.757
It's a fucking sleepy robot in a cave.
How is that a quarter of a bill?

08:17.342 --> 08:22.222
I'm just struck by the number
of pieces that knife Dad

08:22.222 --> 08:25.516
and imply that his children,
particularly his younger sons,

08:25.516 --> 08:28.478
have been covering for him
for quite some time.

08:29.269 --> 08:31.147
- Hugo?
- Yeah?

08:32.524 --> 08:34.734
If someone's briefing anything
against Dad,

08:35.068 --> 08:39.113
we'll fucking crucify them, okay?
Ratfucker Sam, okay?

08:39.113 --> 08:40.407
Okay.

08:41.950 --> 08:45.620
Rome, do you wanna do the Matsson
dossier together for angles, yeah?

08:45.620 --> 08:47.538
Let's do it.

08:48.122 --> 08:53.962
Yeah, I don't actually care
if you wanna burn Dad's legacy...

08:54.378 --> 08:57.631
Shiv, we're trying
to prep to get inside his head

08:57.631 --> 09:01.051
to squeeze every nickel out
of this fucking thing

09:01.051 --> 09:03.722
and keeping the numbers straight
across five fucking divisions.

09:03.722 --> 09:06.932
Shiv, we're death-wrestling
with ogres.

09:06.932 --> 09:09.518
You're reading documents,
is what you're doing, Ken.

09:13.147 --> 09:16.735
You know one thing, if you want,
just to mention it.

09:16.735 --> 09:19.028
- What?
- We can cut Tom's throat.

09:23.283 --> 09:25.784
Well...
Yeah, how's he doing?

09:25.784 --> 09:27.954
I mean, he's doing fine.

09:27.954 --> 09:31.875
We thought in case that might
be a nice thing for you.

09:32.667 --> 09:37.296
Well, thanks.
It's so nice of you to offer that.

09:38.297 --> 09:39.424
You know what?

09:39.424 --> 09:41.760
I'm up to my fucking eyeballs
in investor conference shit,

09:41.760 --> 09:44.845
so I should speak to Gerri.

09:49.726 --> 09:53.396
I don't know, guys, I would say
there's a lot to admire.

09:53.396 --> 09:55.065
Yeah, did you see?

09:55.065 --> 10:00.028
Their deputy of comms
is a ski jumper, ex-Winter Olympian.

10:00.028 --> 10:02.113
- Yeah, I saw.
- A ski jumper?

10:03.489 --> 10:05.909
You can hardly stand up.
You're fucked.

10:05.909 --> 10:10.288
Fullbrights coming out of their ass.
NASDAQ master race.

10:10.288 --> 10:15.459
They're just a bunch of really
impressive, very serious young people.

10:15.459 --> 10:18.212
Did you see what happened when
they acquired the video game publisher?

10:18.212 --> 10:19.880
Less than 10% retention.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.925
They went through
the place like fire ants.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.050
Incredibly meritocratic.

10:23.050 --> 10:26.346
Insular, weird, brutal
motherfuckers and we're dead.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.349
Hey, come on guys, listen.

10:29.975 --> 10:34.103
Sure, they're young and they're fit,
but they're European.

10:34.520 --> 10:35.646
They're soft.

10:36.106 --> 10:38.524
Hammocked in their social
security safety nets.

10:39.066 --> 10:41.819
Sick on vacation mania,
and free healthcare.

10:41.819 --> 10:44.905
They may think they're Vikings,
but we've been raised by wolves.

10:44.905 --> 10:48.033
Exposed to a pathogen that
goes by the name Logan Roy.

10:48.033 --> 10:52.079
And they have no idea
what's coming to them, okay?

10:57.584 --> 10:59.295
We're snakes on a plane.

11:08.512 --> 11:10.682
You guys clock that he's a movie guy?

11:11.182 --> 11:15.185
We might need a line in case
he queries the fucking cash incinerator

11:15.185 --> 11:16.521
that the studio is right now.

11:16.896 --> 11:22.402
Belt's so fucking tight.
It's like strangling me.

11:24.903 --> 11:26.406
You nervous, Ken?

11:29.034 --> 11:31.702
No, he's just some guy.

11:32.494 --> 11:33.705
The Iceman.

11:34.247 --> 11:38.751
I don't know, maybe a little anxious
about the deal, sure.

11:40.003 --> 11:41.503
All right, you're good.

11:41.503 --> 11:45.300
Just, you know, fucking every dollar
you squeeze makes us stronger

11:45.300 --> 11:48.053
for when we do Pierce-ATN, yeah?

12:05.736 --> 12:07.529
Let's see how it goes.

12:07.529 --> 12:10.282
I'm looking forward to meeting
your winter Olympian.

12:10.282 --> 12:13.244
Andreas Bloc? The guy blew
a seven point lead

12:13.244 --> 12:16.955
at the Sochi Winter Games.
He's a possible choker.

12:16.955 --> 12:18.208
Possible choker!

12:19.917 --> 12:21.169
Where should we go?

12:21.169 --> 12:23.462
Which way to Chairman
Matsson's re-education camp?

12:23.462 --> 12:26.132
Take a seat, it's next stop.
We're about to leave.

12:26.132 --> 12:27.592
Two more bags coming.

12:36.935 --> 12:38.435
Shiv, pretty nice, huh?

13:16.890 --> 13:19.393
I already got fucking mud
on my sneaks.

13:19.936 --> 13:22.188
- Nice.
- You like the merch?

13:22.896 --> 13:25.066
I'm gonna jerk off over it
while staring at you.

13:25.066 --> 13:27.943
You like that, you little bitch?
I see you.

13:29.070 --> 13:31.656
- Look out your window.
- Is that you?

13:31.656 --> 13:33.742
Yeah, of course that's me,
the handsome one.

13:34.074 --> 13:38.037
Is yours small?
Mine is fucking small.

13:38.037 --> 13:40.915
When a bear shits in the woods,
it uses one of these, I think.

13:43.043 --> 13:44.961
- Yeah. Let me call you back.
- Yeah, great.

13:45.335 --> 13:48.797
So divisional heads, etc.
are offered brunch

13:48.797 --> 13:53.178
and Matsson's invited
the negotiating team up top

13:53.178 --> 13:55.680
to get into it and they'll escort us
if you want.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.349
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:14.282 --> 14:17.993
Hey, you wanna walk the deck
once more, talk the angles,

14:17.993 --> 14:20.830
the foreseeable unforeseens?

14:20.830 --> 14:23.082
No, we're good.
Good on the plan.

14:24.376 --> 14:27.127
Well, yeah, everyone has a plan
until they get punched in the mouth.

14:27.544 --> 14:31.465
But I might just add,
I've seen guys going in,

14:33.968 --> 14:37.471
playing hardball and then
not being able to row back.

14:38.347 --> 14:42.560
Your dad, often,
he would just start with a joke,

14:43.185 --> 14:46.481
just to establish that no matter
how tough things are...

14:46.481 --> 14:48.608
That's the whole thing, right?

14:49.609 --> 14:53.320
Bringing an offer lower than 144,
net result unhappiness.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.032
Over 144, net result happiness.

14:56.032 --> 14:59.160
Increasing exponentially with each
additional dollar

14:59.160 --> 15:01.578
until such time as Karl
creams his pants

15:01.578 --> 15:03.497
while dropping
into his golden parachute.

15:03.497 --> 15:06.084
Aiming for 147,
hoping for 148,

15:06.084 --> 15:10.170
but with everything,
would settle for 145, 146.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.590
Right?
That's the whole of the game?

15:12.590 --> 15:13.842
- Rome.
- Hey, Con.

15:13.842 --> 15:16.927
- I'm at Frank E. Campbell.
- Yeah, now it's not a good time.

15:16.927 --> 15:20.265
Look, are you guys okay to talk?

15:20.265 --> 15:24.393
Because Marcia's been in.

15:24.768 --> 15:27.479
And she's talking about putting him
in a kilt,

15:27.479 --> 15:30.692
like a fucking Bay City roller.

15:30.692 --> 15:32.277
What?

15:32.277 --> 15:36.113
It's Con. Marcia's been in, and
they're talking about dad with a kilt.

15:36.113 --> 15:38.241
- What?
- Yeah.

15:39.034 --> 15:42.662
Can he just fucking figure it out?
Is it just drama?

15:42.995 --> 15:45.040
Yeah, yeah.
I heard that, Ken.

15:45.040 --> 15:46.833
I got a pretty full plate here.

15:47.541 --> 15:50.754
I just had to cancel on a room full
of working class whites in Cleveland.

15:51.129 --> 15:53.839
So look, I am genuinely concerned

15:54.299 --> 15:56.885
that he will look odd
and I'll be blamed.

15:56.885 --> 16:01.138
Con, we appreciate
you holding it down for us,

16:01.138 --> 16:04.391
but what do you need from us?

16:04.391 --> 16:05.477
Carte blanche.

16:05.894 --> 16:11.023
If I go in the embalming room
and start throwing my weight around,

16:11.023 --> 16:14.611
I'm gonna need to make some asks,
but I don't wanna get blamed.

16:15.028 --> 16:17.905
Sure, okay, Con, carte blanche,
you're empowered.

16:17.905 --> 16:19.490
No recriminations.

16:21.785 --> 16:24.828
If you want, send photos
or whatever.

16:24.828 --> 16:27.624
Send photos? He's not taking him
to the fucking beach.

16:27.624 --> 16:30.627
Don't send photos.
Okay, bye, bye!

16:32.002 --> 16:33.962
Can I have a waffle, please?

16:35.173 --> 16:36.216
Looks good.

16:36.673 --> 16:40.679
Serious Scandi spread here.
Thank you so much.

16:42.971 --> 16:44.515
What's this guy?

16:44.515 --> 16:47.852
Ambush, he took the bait,
fattened for the kill.

16:47.852 --> 16:50.145
- Hi.
- Good luck, everybody.

16:50.145 --> 16:51.606
- Hello.
- How you doing?

16:51.606 --> 16:52.981
- Hey, gang!
- Hi there.

16:52.981 --> 16:55.192
- Hi, morning!
- How you doing?

16:55.192 --> 16:59.698
Ebba? Good afternoon!
Comms and public affairs.

16:59.698 --> 17:01.323
- Karolina.
- Yes, exactly.

17:01.950 --> 17:04.702
You look well, very refreshed.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.038
Hi, Tom.

17:08.122 --> 17:10.125
Oskar? I'm Tom.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.835
Tom, Tom of Siobhan?

17:12.835 --> 17:15.088
Yeah... And ATN.

17:15.671 --> 17:19.717
So I'm not really part
of this whole situation.

17:19.717 --> 17:24.138
And yeah, if you want
a little guide of our forest,

17:24.138 --> 17:28.475
the mighty oaks of Waystar and
the deadwood, just give me a nod.

17:28.475 --> 17:30.603
- Okay?
- You're the guy?

17:30.603 --> 17:33.356
I'm the guy.
All right, good to see you.

17:36.568 --> 17:38.945
Easy, buddy.
Leave some for us.

17:39.487 --> 17:41.864
Would you like some?
I'm happy to share.

17:41.864 --> 17:45.577
I metabolize fast
because I'm dynamic.

17:48.413 --> 17:50.457
Andreas! Hey, man.

17:51.915 --> 17:56.086
They tell me that you nearly got
a bronze at Sochi.

17:57.629 --> 17:59.214
Another lifetime, you know.

17:59.214 --> 18:00.507
Oh, man!

18:01.176 --> 18:04.095
That's almost huge, man, you know?

18:04.095 --> 18:06.597
Those darn tenths of a second, huh?

18:14.814 --> 18:16.148
That guy's a dick.

18:16.858 --> 18:17.942
Hey.

18:18.734 --> 18:20.278
Hey, hey, there he is.

18:20.987 --> 18:24.573
Wow, look at you all.
Rolling deep, huh?

18:25.492 --> 18:28.578
Rock Steady Crew.
What's up?

18:28.578 --> 18:31.288
Hey. You made it.

18:31.288 --> 18:33.583
- Hey, bro.
- What the fuck are you doing here?

18:34.375 --> 18:36.670
- Keen to get into it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:37.503 --> 18:39.047
I'm not sure, what do we do here?

18:39.047 --> 18:40.799
Am I gonna get a lawsuit
if I hug you or?

18:40.799 --> 18:42.758
Maybe, wanna find out?

18:44.177 --> 18:45.427
Okay.

18:47.347 --> 18:50.684
Wow, you brought
the whole gang, huh ?

18:50.684 --> 18:52.352
Outmaneuvered me.

18:53.353 --> 18:54.604
I'm solo, baby.

18:55.229 --> 18:58.233
Are you guys scared to come
talk without the village elders?

18:58.899 --> 19:00.192
No.

19:00.192 --> 19:02.277
We don't wanna outman you, bro.

19:03.404 --> 19:05.323
- I'm just kidding.
- Let's talk.

19:05.323 --> 19:06.950
- But seriously...
- Just us.

19:06.950 --> 19:09.868
- Let's chat.
- If you want...

19:11.245 --> 19:13.081
Fuck him and his dude-bluff.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.964
Thanks for coming out.
Appreciate it.

19:22.089 --> 19:23.550
I know it's not ideal.

19:25.176 --> 19:28.345
Yeah, well, felt like our dad died yesterday.

19:28.847 --> 19:30.431
It was a couple of days ago, so...

19:30.431 --> 19:33.935
At least you didn't find him yourself,
BMW still running.

19:35.185 --> 19:39.064
- That shit can be traumatic.
- Right, sure, sure.

19:42.443 --> 19:44.028
No sorries for Lukas?

19:44.028 --> 19:47.114
No, sure. I'm sorry.
Sorry, man.

19:47.656 --> 19:48.867
It's not a competition.

19:48.867 --> 19:52.996
Saw that your little kicky ball team,
they won a thing.

19:52.996 --> 19:55.289
They did a win or something.
Congrats on that.

19:55.289 --> 19:58.251
Yeah, yeah, thank you.
Good dossier.

19:58.251 --> 20:00.295
You wanna know what I have on you?

20:00.295 --> 20:01.588
Yeah.

20:02.172 --> 20:04.007
- So, do you wanna...
- Also, in terms of...

20:08.844 --> 20:10.888
Relax, guys.
It's just me, we can talk.

20:11.806 --> 20:14.516
- All right?
- Okay.

20:16.393 --> 20:18.937
So what the fuck is this place?

20:18.937 --> 20:22.816
Like the fucking 50K wedding
mill for lawyers' daughters?

20:22.816 --> 20:24.234
Bridal shots by the window?

20:24.234 --> 20:29.491
I know, it's kind of bullshit,
but it's also cool.

20:29.491 --> 20:32.534
I don't give a fuck, honestly.
But can we get into it?

20:32.534 --> 20:35.747
I feel like I wanna say shit.
Do you want me to wait?

20:35.747 --> 20:37.540
Yeah, yeah, let's get into it.

20:38.290 --> 20:41.753
We've come to say
that we like your offer.

20:42.711 --> 20:45.674
But we don't as yet think it reflects
the full valuation

20:45.674 --> 20:47.967
of the potential
of what you're purchasing.

20:48.510 --> 20:49.803
Okay.

20:50.679 --> 20:54.390
And your stock dropped 20%
on Friday?

20:54.390 --> 20:57.102
- And regained 10 Monday.
- Okay.

20:57.518 --> 21:00.021
Logan was never gonna be part
of the company going forward.

21:00.021 --> 21:03.857
On a business sense,
his absence is not relevant.

21:03.857 --> 21:07.695
Our key growth drivers are
unaffected by our father's passing.

21:07.695 --> 21:08.947
The dip is the dip.

21:08.947 --> 21:12.492
But I still feel like I'm going
to the checkout during the sale

21:12.492 --> 21:13.827
and getting asked to pay more.

21:13.827 --> 21:17.579
Well, Lukas, if you were
willing to pay 144 last week,

21:17.579 --> 21:18.999
shareholders won't like...

21:18.999 --> 21:20.417
Can I interrupt you right there?

21:20.417 --> 21:22.961
I'd rather you didn't,
but you already did, so...

21:24.420 --> 21:27.674
I would like to propose an offer.

21:30.134 --> 21:32.469
I wanna buy
your entire operation

21:33.388 --> 21:37.224
for the price of one...

21:41.395 --> 21:43.231
... single dollar.

21:49.863 --> 21:52.573
- I'm kidding.
- That's really good.

21:52.907 --> 21:54.950
That's funny. One single dollar.

21:54.950 --> 21:58.037
Sorry. Your face...

22:00.498 --> 22:03.084
But I do want ATN though.

22:03.418 --> 22:06.963
Well, no, ATN's off the table,
Dad carved it out.

22:06.963 --> 22:09.548
Yeah, I'm not sure it makes sense
and I want it back in.

22:09.548 --> 22:11.384
- Why?
- Why?

22:11.384 --> 22:12.427
Why?

22:17.514 --> 22:20.060
I feel like I don't
have to say why, do I?

22:20.726 --> 22:24.355
It's the original deal.
We have the shape.

22:25.732 --> 22:28.693
This can be fast, you can get the
sugar that you came looking for.

22:31.362 --> 22:33.865
- The price is what?
- I don't think we're at price.

22:33.865 --> 22:35.783
Like 187 per share.

22:36.909 --> 22:40.664
50/50 cash-stock for the whole thing.

22:53.342 --> 22:54.885
Are you gonna tell me what you think?

22:56.887 --> 22:58.263
Yeah, yeah, sure.

22:59.056 --> 23:01.141
All right, maybe you guys
haven't done this before,

23:01.141 --> 23:03.895
but how it usually works is,
I say something

23:05.105 --> 23:06.605
and then you say something.

23:06.605 --> 23:11.152
- Cuz if you don't say anything...
- Can I interrupt you and say fuck off?

23:11.152 --> 23:12.778
Thanks for the pro tip.

23:12.778 --> 23:15.115
We weren't expecting that,

23:15.115 --> 23:17.659
and I'm not sure that that works.

23:17.659 --> 23:19.118
It works.

23:19.118 --> 23:22.372
Okay, yeah, well, we're not sure
that it does work.

23:24.039 --> 23:25.332
It works.

23:28.711 --> 23:31.756
Do you maybe wanna check in
with the boiled eggs out there?

23:33.924 --> 23:36.510
Well, yeah, this is a material change,
we need to...

23:36.510 --> 23:39.221
Of course, of course, all that.
100%.

23:40.849 --> 23:42.599
But do you like it?

23:43.642 --> 23:44.978
Just between us.

23:46.770 --> 23:48.313
You like it a little bit, don't you?

23:49.314 --> 23:50.775
There's something there.

23:51.484 --> 23:55.405
You don't have to answer,
but maybe an indication?

23:58.033 --> 23:59.283
Bit of bubbles?

23:59.909 --> 24:01.618
I think we're just gonna take a beat, actually.

24:02.245 --> 24:03.912
We're just gonna, yeah.

24:05.373 --> 24:07.082
- We'll talk later.
- Yeah.

24:07.082 --> 24:08.625
Okay?

24:20.346 --> 24:22.098
So fucking eager.

24:23.141 --> 24:25.559
- We say, yeah?
- Yeah, we say.

24:26.894 --> 24:31.607
Hi, so the offer is 187,

24:31.607 --> 24:33.901
but he wants ATN.

24:33.901 --> 24:35.612
He's right there.

24:35.612 --> 24:38.906
Okay, well, why don't you
tuck your boner away, Karl?

24:38.906 --> 24:41.950
- But he wants the deal?
- Yeah, he wants the deal.

24:42.534 --> 24:44.788
And I think he knows
ATN is an emotive issue,

24:44.788 --> 24:46.372
and he's being a fucking asshole.

24:46.372 --> 24:50.001
Sure, sure, sure,
but excellent news, gents.

24:51.126 --> 24:54.296
- Excellent.
- You effectively achieved a bump.

24:54.296 --> 24:56.799
Yeah, we did amazing,
we're amazing people.

24:56.799 --> 24:58.218
So we take it to the board.

24:58.218 --> 25:01.388
Well, first we have to run through it
and make sure it works.

25:01.388 --> 25:04.015
- Where's Shiv?
- She went back down.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.059
Okay.
We will talk to her too.

25:07.059 --> 25:08.560
Let's go do that.

25:10.271 --> 25:11.606
Excellent.

25:12.649 --> 25:14.608
You think he's just trying
to fuck with us?

25:14.608 --> 25:16.944
He actually wants ATN
or is this a move

25:16.944 --> 25:19.488
so that we have to subtract
and he goes low?

25:19.488 --> 25:21.449
Who cares, what do we want?

25:21.449 --> 25:23.034
Well, we want to keep it, right?

25:23.034 --> 25:26.620
We do dad's deal, keep ATN,
we add PGN,

25:27.121 --> 25:32.251
and you, me, and Shiv, you know,
the Three Fuckateers.

25:32.251 --> 25:34.254
So I just got a bad rumor
in my ears.

25:35.088 --> 25:38.425
Apparently ATN has an open line
to Jeryd Mencken's campaign team

25:38.425 --> 25:42.095
and they're just dialed in
on editorial morning conference.

25:42.846 --> 25:44.389
Did you know that?

25:44.389 --> 25:45.765
I did not know that.

25:46.640 --> 25:49.394
Rome, if this comes out,
this blows any credibility.

25:50.269 --> 25:51.730
- Yep.
- It's not okay.

25:51.730 --> 25:53.188
- Yeah.
- Rome.

25:53.188 --> 25:56.775
Yeah, I don't know, fucking Cyd.
Cyd is in operational charge.

25:56.775 --> 25:59.529
- It's a mutual back scratch.
- Even Dad had a line.

25:59.529 --> 26:03.073
Look, Shiv, we should get into that.

26:03.073 --> 26:04.784
It's not okay.

26:08.163 --> 26:10.165
But we do need to focus.

26:10.165 --> 26:14.543
Big picture, we should discuss what
do we think on ATN folded back in.

26:16.463 --> 26:17.839
ATN back in?

26:18.506 --> 26:21.217
Fuck, well then yeah, sure, fine,
get rid of it.

26:21.217 --> 26:22.802
It's a toxic asset.

26:22.802 --> 26:25.763
It's also Dad's pride and joy
he died trying to keep.

26:25.763 --> 26:28.640
Let's just keep one
of his old sweaters, less racist.

26:28.640 --> 26:31.019
You know, there's leverage
in not looking too thirsty.

26:31.477 --> 26:35.397
He needs to know that if there's no
deal, we're good, we survive, thrive.

26:35.397 --> 26:37.275
But do we?
Can we?

26:37.275 --> 26:40.110
Well, Ken and I have been doing
a pretty good job.

26:40.110 --> 26:41.821
In the last 24 hours.

26:41.821 --> 26:43.989
Price is stabilized,
markets seem to like us.

26:43.989 --> 26:46.367
Yeah, the markets like
that you're selling to Matsson.

26:47.827 --> 26:49.661
Well, Dad wanted to keep ATN.

26:49.661 --> 26:51.873
Yeah, but he also wanted
to poison Brezhnev

26:51.873 --> 26:55.001
and hang Mandela,
doesn't mean he's always right.

26:55.001 --> 26:57.544
I think that overall, he wanted
the deal, so...

26:58.045 --> 27:01.965
Well, we don't know.
We can't navigate by Dad maps.

27:01.965 --> 27:03.759
- He's not here.
- I know he's not here.

27:03.759 --> 27:06.970
I have a giant hole in my heart
and a 24 hour migraine.

27:07.555 --> 27:09.975
I'm just saying,
I don't think we know

27:09.975 --> 27:12.976
would he have done the deal,
would he not have done the deal?

27:12.976 --> 27:17.356
You know what? Whatever.
Let's get the deal done.

27:27.741 --> 27:30.745
Okay, so we need to play
this very delicately.

27:31.412 --> 27:34.416
Laid before you is a chess board,
so every move is crucial.

27:34.416 --> 27:35.833
So what have you got?

27:37.002 --> 27:39.421
Matsson, pretty cold.

27:40.546 --> 27:44.425
When he's fucking randos, he does
noise cancelling headphones.

27:45.801 --> 27:47.052
Podcasts.

27:47.512 --> 27:52.475
He just lies back, cans on,
watches them slide the bean pole.

27:52.850 --> 27:56.186
Okay. Well, I'm not sure how I'm
gonna use that to my advantage.

27:56.186 --> 27:58.856
And what about in terms
of the cage fighting?

27:58.856 --> 28:02.068
So some say Ebba,
some say Oskar.

28:03.027 --> 28:05.070
In terms of who's keeping
the kill list.

28:05.070 --> 28:06.321
So there is a kill list?

28:07.156 --> 28:10.160
I have it on good authority.
There's a kill list, yeah.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.581
Like, eight, nine names.
It's evolving.

28:14.581 --> 28:17.667
Okay, I'm going in. Fuck it.
I need profile.

28:17.667 --> 28:18.960
But keep your eyes out, okay?

28:18.960 --> 28:22.130
If I need a pawn sacrifice,
I'm gonna give you the eyes. Okay?

28:32.307 --> 28:33.892
Can I take a beer, please?

28:33.892 --> 28:36.852
The bankers will give
the number yellow light,

28:36.852 --> 28:38.855
so that gives us room for maneuvers.

28:39.856 --> 28:41.023
Okay.

28:41.941 --> 28:44.027
What's up?
What's the counter?

28:45.528 --> 28:46.905
What?

28:46.905 --> 28:49.948
Just saying, in case you guys
wanna sling some ideas around.

28:51.700 --> 28:54.663
Just within the safety of the quad.

28:56.998 --> 28:59.291
- The quad?
- Yeah, the quad squad.

28:59.833 --> 29:05.131
The Roy Patrol, the old team,
the family.

29:06.298 --> 29:09.176
The fuck? Yeah, maybe you could
get me a coffee or something.

29:18.144 --> 29:20.354
Hey. Mind if I perch?

29:21.314 --> 29:22.690
Sure, no problem.

29:23.358 --> 29:26.443
Lukas, you remember we laughed.
We were at Sun Valley.

29:26.443 --> 29:32.283
We were mocking Sundar's
cargo shorts, the creases.

29:37.163 --> 29:38.999
Okay. Yeah.

29:40.542 --> 29:45.088
Well, we were just discussing...
Is France gonna make it?

29:46.881 --> 29:49.299
Sorry, in terms of...

29:50.050 --> 29:52.428
As in like, will France make it?

29:52.428 --> 29:55.848
Birth rate, youth unemployment,
sclerotic state,

29:56.433 --> 29:59.018
fucking angry Arabs, all that.

29:59.018 --> 30:01.812
Will they make it or will they pull
a Greece?

30:02.188 --> 30:04.732
Well, I think what you need
to know about,

30:04.732 --> 30:10.195
from a US news perspective,
is that we really don't give a fuck.

30:11.280 --> 30:15.535
US is late imperial
and we don't know.

30:15.535 --> 30:17.494
Because we don't really wanna know.

30:17.494 --> 30:21.165
We have our own Paris and
when it burns, we'll build another.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.877
Wow, Tom.

30:24.793 --> 30:29.382
I read a great article recently
in The Economist about this.

30:29.382 --> 30:32.384
Excuse me.
"The Economist", s'il vous plait!

30:32.384 --> 30:36.348
Tell us more.
No, no, go on, go on, go on.

30:36.348 --> 30:39.600
Yeah, just in terms of education
and quality of life,

30:40.226 --> 30:45.774
old lady France, fucking don't fucking
bet against the old fucking...

30:45.774 --> 30:50.236
The baguette might be mightier
than the bagel.

30:50.236 --> 30:54.074
Sorry. Who are you?
I don't remember you from the list.

30:54.074 --> 30:55.867
- Me?
- Yeah.

30:56.493 --> 30:58.078
Therein hangs a tale.

30:58.410 --> 31:01.246
Greg Hirsch, Ory.
Gregory Hirsch.

31:01.246 --> 31:04.209
He's a cousin.
He's Logan's nephew.

31:04.542 --> 31:06.752
Wait, are you serious?

31:08.129 --> 31:10.298
He's my cousin. He's good.

31:10.757 --> 31:12.424
There's more of them.

31:13.842 --> 31:18.139
Wait, are you all related?
This is one big...

31:21.308 --> 31:25.562
Did we end up at one of those
incestuous family reunions?

31:26.898 --> 31:31.568
Six-foot nine of pure nepotism.
Inbred Hapsburg giant.

31:33.488 --> 31:36.240
- Yeah, you agree?
- Yeah, I do. I do actually.

31:37.991 --> 31:42.413
Are you done?
Maybe it's funnier with subtitles.

31:42.413 --> 31:44.207
Sorry, man, sorry.

31:44.207 --> 31:47.252
It's fine,
I've seen enough of this shit.

31:47.876 --> 31:50.672
But, yeah, you do what you like.

31:50.672 --> 31:54.216
We're just passing time
till you come up with a counter.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.513
You wanna do this here?

32:00.723 --> 32:01.933
All right.

32:09.815 --> 32:12.151
- Thanks, Ken.
- Yeah, give us a minute.

32:13.611 --> 32:15.362
Okay, well...

32:18.533 --> 32:20.492
I don't wanna preempt
the board,

32:21.661 --> 32:25.748
but my view, our view,
it's not necessarily compelling.

32:26.583 --> 32:27.959
We're running the numbers,

32:27.959 --> 32:31.670
but we wanna explore options
for us keeping ATN.

32:33.131 --> 32:35.382
Okay, bad.

32:35.382 --> 32:38.845
We just wanna hear you on price
for dad's deal, no ATN.

32:39.929 --> 32:41.638
You don't want ATN.

32:41.638 --> 32:44.725
Okay, sure, but we kinda do.

32:44.725 --> 32:46.101
You don't.

32:47.144 --> 32:50.148
I've been talking to Oskar
and we see a way back.

32:50.148 --> 32:51.565
You see a way back?

32:53.193 --> 32:55.028
Okay, wow, okay.

32:55.028 --> 32:58.698
You see a way back
for our phenomenally lucrative

32:58.698 --> 33:01.284
and influential news operation?

33:01.284 --> 33:03.994
You gonna save that?
Thanks, bro.

33:03.994 --> 33:07.748
It's fine, but the graph is horrible.

33:07.748 --> 33:13.128
Well, look, honestly,
we're concerned about the fit,

33:13.128 --> 33:14.713
about your vision,

33:14.713 --> 33:18.468
and with half our value
coming in stock, 50/50 split,

33:19.385 --> 33:24.348
we stand to lose a lot of value if you
screw it up, so it's complicated.

33:25.974 --> 33:27.894
It's not complicated, I've seen it.

33:28.769 --> 33:31.480
It's a lot of yelling,
small men, big veins.

33:31.480 --> 33:33.190
Fat wallets.

33:33.190 --> 33:36.987
Sure, but long term, I don't think
news for angry old people works.

33:37.444 --> 33:41.615
I don't, I would fold it in,
fat pipe that shit,

33:41.615 --> 33:43.827
make it more Bloomberg grey.

33:44.702 --> 33:48.999
Simple, cheap, huge, Ikea'ed to fuck.

33:48.999 --> 33:50.499
Dude, I gotta say,

33:51.835 --> 33:55.379
I think maybe you don't understand
what you're buying.

33:55.379 --> 33:58.799
And maybe that's why there's
a disconnect here on value.

33:58.799 --> 34:01.385
Sure, lecture me, Vaulter guy.

34:02.554 --> 34:05.014
Hey, took a big swing.

34:06.140 --> 34:11.020
If you look at experiences, you look
at the high ceiling on parks, cruises,

34:11.020 --> 34:13.689
IP turboed residential
from a trusted brand...

34:14.898 --> 34:17.944
- Did you call it a trusted brand?
- Yeah.

34:17.944 --> 34:22.281
No, no, it's a parts shop.

34:23.450 --> 34:25.994
Good parts, yes, bad brand.

34:30.914 --> 34:33.167
Gotta say, I just think
fundamentally you're wrong.

34:33.167 --> 34:36.545
Yeah, well, I don't care what
you think, you're a tribute band.

34:40.507 --> 34:42.634
- We okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

34:42.634 --> 34:45.013
I'm just trying to make you
fucking rich.

34:46.097 --> 34:47.474
Already rich.

34:48.307 --> 34:51.895
Okay, well, on the offer, I think
I am what I am what I am.

34:52.811 --> 34:57.317
Okay, Popeye, we'll check in,
take it back to the board, right?

34:57.317 --> 34:59.276
Hate to see this break down.

34:59.276 --> 35:02.154
Yeah, let's make it work.

35:03.906 --> 35:07.285
All right, it's time, time for sauna.

35:07.285 --> 35:12.457
Sauna, sauna, sauna!
Come on!

35:25.261 --> 35:28.056
My God!

35:30.015 --> 35:31.350
Poor bastards.

35:33.477 --> 35:36.231
Hanging in the window
like Peking duck.

35:39.901 --> 35:41.819
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:41.819 --> 35:45.281
Sorry about the shit weather here.
Should have been here last week.

35:45.281 --> 35:48.410
Yeah, well, everything
was better last week.

35:48.410 --> 35:51.245
So, Siobhan, this is Ebba,
our head of comms.

35:51.245 --> 35:52.746
Hey, hi.

35:52.746 --> 35:55.709
Ebba's like an estrogen air freshener
we keep around

35:55.709 --> 35:58.544
to try to keep us smelling clean.

35:58.544 --> 36:00.463
It's okay, I keep notes.

36:00.463 --> 36:03.841
When I walk, it either goes
in my book or they pay me off.

36:03.841 --> 36:06.427
You'll never walk, you fucking love it.

36:07.637 --> 36:09.139
I love it?

36:13.268 --> 36:17.271
So how bad was this thing?

36:17.271 --> 36:21.609
This, the majestic stag sparring
with their memory foam hard-ons?

36:21.609 --> 36:23.778
It was a breathtaking spectacle.

36:25.322 --> 36:28.824
Listen, I like to fuck around.

36:29.617 --> 36:34.622
I do, but I like to fuck around
like psilocybin at breakfast.

36:35.497 --> 36:39.168
When it comes to money,
just say the fucking number.

36:40.794 --> 36:43.673
Sure, so what am I,
the messenger girl?

36:44.423 --> 36:47.634
Is it there?
The fucking deal.

36:50.430 --> 36:51.764
Yeah, potentially.

36:53.058 --> 36:54.434
It's potentially there.

37:16.539 --> 37:19.416
What do you think?
How does it feel?

37:21.670 --> 37:23.420
Yeah, I don't know.

37:23.962 --> 37:28.592
Not great, but also I guess
that's the thing, right?

37:29.802 --> 37:33.264
We're selling,
it's like have we won or lost?

37:33.264 --> 37:34.973
It's kind of hard to tell.

37:38.979 --> 37:40.522
Because...

37:41.898 --> 37:44.150
... I think I'd like to tank
the deal.

37:44.775 --> 37:46.443
Keep ATN?

37:48.404 --> 37:51.240
I think tank the whole deal.

37:51.825 --> 37:54.743
Like kill it, blow it up.

37:58.623 --> 38:04.086
Well, that's quite the high risk.
piece of fucking swords swallowing.

38:04.086 --> 38:06.506
I like running the ship,
I think we're good at it,

38:06.506 --> 38:08.966
and I don't want to stop.
I mean, do you?

38:10.968 --> 38:13.554
Well, everyone wants the deal,
it's dad's deal.

38:14.848 --> 38:16.056
He's a bad fit.

38:17.141 --> 38:18.350
You know it, he's a bad fit.

38:18.350 --> 38:21.311
He doesn't get the company,
and I think he's gonna fuck it.

38:21.937 --> 38:23.856
We've seen him up close,
and he's a card trick,

38:23.856 --> 38:26.483
and he's gonna destroy
everything dad built.

38:30.738 --> 38:33.449
You wanna chew it with Shivy?

38:34.784 --> 38:37.704
Yeah, I just think...

38:37.704 --> 38:38.913
What?

38:39.789 --> 38:41.374
Can Pinky dance?

38:42.332 --> 38:46.212
I mean, no, obviously not, but...

38:48.089 --> 38:49.506
You like it though?

38:51.091 --> 38:53.887
Go from fucking weekend warriors
to bossing full time?

38:55.220 --> 38:56.805
It's dad's deal.

38:57.306 --> 39:00.517
It just, it feels,
fucking do the deal.

39:00.934 --> 39:03.938
Finish his breakfast, you know.
What do you think he would do?

39:04.646 --> 39:06.483
- What do I think he would do?
- Yeah.

39:07.316 --> 39:10.195
Exactly whatever the fuck he wanted, right?

39:10.195 --> 39:11.571
That's right.

39:13.072 --> 39:15.241
Well, we have to make him walk, right?

39:16.033 --> 39:18.536
- So that he thinks it's his call?
- Yeah.

39:18.536 --> 39:20.664
I mean, if the old guard smells
that we're getting smart,

39:20.664 --> 39:22.749
they're gonna shit their beans,
go crying to the board,

39:22.749 --> 39:24.584
and we're fucking toast.

39:26.378 --> 39:29.588
It's a fucking tightrope walk
on a straight razor.

39:30.214 --> 39:32.341
500 foot reputational drop.

39:32.341 --> 39:35.053
Okay, why is that making you smile?
That shouldn't make you smile.

39:35.053 --> 39:38.348
Who likes tightrope
walking a straight razor, nut bag?

39:38.348 --> 39:41.058
I just think it's
fucking feel the force time.

39:41.558 --> 39:43.185
Choose our adventure.

39:43.852 --> 39:46.980
Full bore.
Fuck the living shit out of this thing.

39:49.983 --> 39:51.151
You with me?

39:54.030 --> 39:55.239
Yeah, let's do it.

39:56.116 --> 39:58.493
Let's tank it. Let's fucking do it.

40:04.374 --> 40:05.749
All right.

40:05.749 --> 40:10.005
I can find it hard
to see the angles on people. You know?

40:11.463 --> 40:13.882
Like I get into things

40:16.761 --> 40:19.138
and then I don't have
very good boundaries.

40:21.306 --> 40:22.808
Like, I'm doing it now.

40:24.893 --> 40:30.483
Okay, so I think a meaningful
bump gets you over the line.

40:32.027 --> 40:33.653
All right.

40:33.653 --> 40:37.782
So you're saying
if I keep offering more and more money,

40:39.326 --> 40:41.118
eventually I'll get it.

40:42.578 --> 40:45.164
- Thanks, top mind.
- You got it.

40:49.210 --> 40:51.296
What do you think of Ebba?

40:54.548 --> 40:57.718
- I don't know.
- Ebba is not good.

40:58.802 --> 41:02.098
She's very, she won't let me in.

41:03.266 --> 41:05.017
What's your Karolina like?

41:05.017 --> 41:07.437
She's good.
Yeah, she's solid.

41:09.606 --> 41:11.608
- Here.
- Sure.

41:12.316 --> 41:17.238
Well, I might be in a bit of a pickle.

41:19.656 --> 41:21.076
People are judging me.

41:22.077 --> 41:23.744
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:25.789 --> 41:27.373
Lots of judging.

41:29.876 --> 41:33.088
So what's going on with your husband
situation thing?

41:35.548 --> 41:40.345
Well, we're fucked.
It's a disaster.

41:41.805 --> 41:44.975
I broke his heart and he broke mine.

41:46.559 --> 41:49.853
And we lost our footing.
I don't know.

41:53.107 --> 41:56.110
Hey, I'm not gonna give you

41:56.652 --> 42:02.075
the whole backstory and everything,
but I was seeing this girl.

42:02.950 --> 42:05.912
And after we broke up,

42:07.579 --> 42:12.418
because of some things that we said
when things were nice

42:12.418 --> 42:18.800
and intense, a sort of a nasty,
friendly joke

42:18.800 --> 42:20.844
about what I shouldn't do.

42:22.803 --> 42:24.597
I sent her some of my blood.

42:25.098 --> 42:26.807
Okay...

42:27.642 --> 42:29.686
Half a liter of frozen blood brick.

42:31.103 --> 42:34.399
- As a joke.
- Half a liter?

42:35.190 --> 42:36.275
Yeah.

42:36.275 --> 42:40.029
Well, I mean, obviously, first of all,
good one.

42:40.697 --> 42:41.865
Yeah.

42:43.825 --> 42:47.202
Well, she got a bit weirded
when I did that.

42:47.202 --> 42:52.875
But I just kept doing it again
and again and again.

42:53.459 --> 42:58.213
And then it became not a joke,
and then a joke again.

42:58.213 --> 43:02.010
And now it's apparently not a joke.

43:05.554 --> 43:06.806
Yeah.

43:07.181 --> 43:11.268
Who is this?

43:12.227 --> 43:13.563
It's Ebba.

43:14.689 --> 43:17.692
Actually, it's Ebba. Yeah.

43:18.609 --> 43:24.698
It's a complex situation.

43:25.908 --> 43:29.453
But I'll just deny it, right?

43:29.453 --> 43:32.749
I'll call bullshit
and just lawyer it out.

43:32.749 --> 43:39.130
Well, deniability is difficult given
she has so much of your blood.

43:42.508 --> 43:44.219
Man, your head of comms...

43:44.219 --> 43:46.846
I don't know who
you got advising you on this,

43:46.846 --> 43:50.183
but whatever they're telling you,
you gotta 10x it.

43:50.183 --> 43:53.770
People don't know you, and
if this acquisition goes through,

43:54.395 --> 43:57.064
US media are gonna be all over you.

43:57.064 --> 44:01.318
So if you're the creepy stalker guy
who sits in the dark writing code,

44:01.318 --> 44:04.656
dripping into an IV bag
and harassing his direct reports,

44:05.948 --> 44:07.826
it's gonna have an economic impact.

44:08.243 --> 44:09.494
That's bad.

44:09.494 --> 44:13.999
Well, three point PR plan
just off the top of my head.

44:14.666 --> 44:18.336
Point one, might be hard for you,

44:19.671 --> 44:22.214
but stop sending people your blood.

44:23.590 --> 44:28.638
And then catch and kill maybe,
or just have a really open meeting.

44:29.806 --> 44:32.474
Do not fire her.

44:33.351 --> 44:35.728
Yeah, you know Gerri
would be good on this.

44:35.728 --> 44:38.856
And I can give you
some informal advice if you like.

44:38.856 --> 44:40.567
I would like that.

44:41.276 --> 44:42.652
I would.

44:45.154 --> 44:47.407
I like you. You're cool.

44:48.450 --> 44:53.121
You're not judgy.
You can take a joke.

44:54.038 --> 44:56.582
I like that.
Like your dad.

44:59.002 --> 45:00.210
Yeah...

45:02.796 --> 45:04.256
- Hey, Kenny!
- Greg, hey.

45:04.716 --> 45:06.301
Listen, I need some help.

45:07.677 --> 45:09.387
Yeah, sure, what do you got for me?

45:09.387 --> 45:13.140
I have a contact. They're gonna
be calling you on this line.

45:17.270 --> 45:18.772
Any additional context?

45:18.772 --> 45:21.274
You're just telling a journalist
the truth,

45:21.274 --> 45:23.526
which is that nobody's getting along.

45:23.526 --> 45:26.946
The two cultures don't mesh
and the deal vibes are bad.

45:26.946 --> 45:29.699
Okay, yeah, sour the vibes
to give us juice in the room.

45:29.699 --> 45:32.327
- Yeah, something like that.
- Quad squad.

45:32.327 --> 45:36.080
- It's quad squad type shit.
- Yeah, you can do that?

45:36.080 --> 45:37.289
Yeah.

45:37.289 --> 45:39.708
Jess, I need you to liaise
with their AV guy.

45:39.708 --> 45:41.628
Set up a screening.

45:41.628 --> 45:45.340
"Kalispitron: Hibernation" rough cut, 4K,

45:45.340 --> 45:47.967
fucking giant screen, full three hours.

45:48.759 --> 45:51.137
- For when?
- Tomorrow morning.

45:52.763 --> 45:54.140
Sure, yeah.

46:12.116 --> 46:15.662
Killing off GoJo members,
one by one like Kalispitron.

46:15.662 --> 46:19.957
Hey!
Hey, you seen this?

46:20.582 --> 46:26.338
Nasty little piece about out here,
no one getting along, bad vibes.

46:27.881 --> 46:29.383
You know where
this is coming from?

46:30.010 --> 46:31.303
Shiv...

46:32.428 --> 46:33.929
Them, I'm sure.

46:33.929 --> 46:36.266
They're probably trying
to put the squeeze on you.

46:38.018 --> 46:40.352
You were getting pretty close
to Lukas last night.

46:40.352 --> 46:41.895
Yeah, you jealous?

46:42.813 --> 46:44.816
Just working the case,
looking for angles.

46:44.816 --> 46:47.819
Right, you get anything we can use?

46:50.030 --> 46:52.239
- Where you going?
- Yeah, I'm gonna go back.

46:52.949 --> 46:54.491
It's so intriguing.

46:56.202 --> 46:59.621
I mean, honestly, no, I think
he wants ATN for real

46:59.621 --> 47:01.040
and he's gonna go high to get it.

47:01.040 --> 47:02.207
So what's the plan?

47:02.207 --> 47:04.209
Up on the ridge, crunch time.

47:04.710 --> 47:09.548
Okay, pitch is we retain ATN
and we'll bite at 146,

47:09.548 --> 47:12.427
or he takes ATN,
but we need a crazy premium.

47:13.218 --> 47:16.473
- Good?
- Yeah, very good.

47:16.473 --> 47:20.351
- Good, great.
- Let's take it to the ridge.

47:20.351 --> 47:22.478
Rock it!
Rock it, fellas!

47:22.478 --> 47:23.813
Shut up.

47:24.439 --> 47:25.482
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:25.482 --> 47:26.690
What are you hearing?

47:26.690 --> 47:29.401
I hear that Jimenez thinks
he's gonna be tap dancing across...

47:29.401 --> 47:31.738
You know, you should be careful, Tom.

47:31.738 --> 47:32.863
Why?

47:32.863 --> 47:34.783
Cuz people are coming down
from molly

47:34.783 --> 47:36.326
and their pupils are dilated.

47:36.326 --> 47:39.037
And your shoes are like looking
at the sun.

47:39.703 --> 47:42.331
No, they're dangerous.

47:42.831 --> 47:45.042
What are you doing?

47:45.042 --> 47:47.044
I'm helping you, Tom.

47:47.044 --> 47:49.046
This is why people
don't take you seriously,

47:49.046 --> 47:50.840
cuz your shoes are so fucking white.

47:52.592 --> 47:55.011
Your earlobes are thick and chewy.

47:55.011 --> 47:57.513
- What the fuck?
- Yeah, like barnacle meat.

47:59.973 --> 48:02.059
How was
your little chat with Lukas?

48:02.477 --> 48:05.647
Good. I mean, he's boring,
but he's very conventionally attractive.

48:07.065 --> 48:08.274
He's broad.

48:08.274 --> 48:10.235
I used to think you were broad,

48:10.235 --> 48:12.569
but, compared to him,
you're wiry.

48:13.070 --> 48:15.490
You're like a fucking spelunker.

48:30.171 --> 48:32.840
Jesus fucking Christ!
Goddammit!

48:33.924 --> 48:35.301
What?

48:36.928 --> 48:41.641
Connor, dad, but it's not dad.
Fucking sent the picture.

48:41.975 --> 48:43.308
Jesus Christ!

48:44.935 --> 48:46.146
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

48:48.605 --> 48:50.024
Do you wanna see it?

48:53.360 --> 48:54.654
No, I don't.

48:56.531 --> 48:58.658
Is it okay?

48:59.950 --> 49:04.705
No. Yeah, it's fine.
It's not, it's just... Fuck!

49:16.926 --> 49:18.970
Sending out cool tweets?

49:18.970 --> 49:20.513
- Hey.
- Hi.

49:23.932 --> 49:25.894
People are fucking tiny, right?

49:26.978 --> 49:28.938
Not us.

49:32.358 --> 49:34.985
So thanks for the link.
I saw the movie.

49:34.985 --> 49:38.614
Yeah, no worries.
You know, it's early cut.

49:38.614 --> 49:41.617
Still some work,
but we're excited.

49:41.617 --> 49:43.327
- It's the big one.
- Yeah?

49:43.327 --> 49:45.664
Yeah. I mean,
it needs to be strategically.

49:45.664 --> 49:48.457
You know, a few issues,
but exciting.

49:48.457 --> 49:50.835
Everything is fine
is the headline.

49:53.004 --> 49:54.923
I feel like there's a but.

49:54.923 --> 49:56.256
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

49:56.256 --> 49:58.677
The first two hours of the movie
is a sleeping robot,

49:58.677 --> 50:00.887
but we can fix it.
We got control of the cut.

50:00.887 --> 50:02.847
But the low down
is that it's spiraling

50:02.847 --> 50:05.976
and tomorrow or soon
there's gonna be a press thing

50:05.976 --> 50:08.561
about it being in crisis
or whatever, something like that.

50:08.561 --> 50:10.647
You know, Hollywood's
always in fucking crisis, right?

50:10.647 --> 50:13.982
Yeah, right, right.
But it's a big one, huh?

50:13.982 --> 50:16.735
Yeah, fucking LA studio
is out of control.

50:17.236 --> 50:21.116
It's cultural issues, but it's cool.
The fix is easy.

50:21.116 --> 50:23.033
We only flag it so you know
we're not hiding.

50:23.033 --> 50:24.535
Appreciate that, thanks.

50:26.537 --> 50:28.331
Hey, guys.

50:30.249 --> 50:31.709
Are you for real?

50:32.085 --> 50:34.087
- What?
- The movie.

50:35.088 --> 50:37.340
What about
these fucking press stories?

50:39.508 --> 50:41.511
Are you Scooby Doo-ing me here?

50:42.554 --> 50:44.097
Is that where you went?

50:44.097 --> 50:46.932
Hanna-Barbera
fucking business school?

50:46.932 --> 50:49.435
You tell me the theme parks
are haunted.

50:49.435 --> 50:52.480
Your big movie is shitty.
Are you tanking the deal?

50:53.857 --> 50:56.109
No, man.
We're just being open.

50:56.734 --> 50:58.777
Look, on our models
and the bank's models,

50:59.361 --> 51:02.699
I think there needs to be more value
for the board to get conviction on this.

51:02.699 --> 51:05.659
Right, the banks. Of course.

51:05.659 --> 51:07.161
Also the pace.

51:07.828 --> 51:11.791
You know, we might need to slow
it down a little. It's a behemoth.

51:13.835 --> 51:15.837
Slow it down a bit.

51:15.837 --> 51:18.882
And we got the election coming up,
and then there'll be the transition.

51:18.882 --> 51:22.384
And we have relationships, so, you
know, in terms of regulatory issues...

51:22.384 --> 51:24.721
I preferred doing this
with your dad.

51:25.971 --> 51:28.391
He was a prick, but at least
he knew what he wanted.

51:28.391 --> 51:33.228
Pedant's corner.
Our dad was not a prick, okay?

51:33.228 --> 51:35.314
Sure, but he was.

51:35.314 --> 51:38.067
There are just some issues,
is the honest truth,

51:38.067 --> 51:40.236
fucking streamers,
studio news, it seems a lot.

51:40.236 --> 51:42.322
I need to make this happen fast.

51:42.322 --> 51:43.781
Totally.

51:44.323 --> 51:48.410
We're committed,
but it's a long distance run.

51:48.410 --> 51:49.953
It's not a sprint.

51:51.538 --> 51:54.083
I think he'd be embarrassed
if he saw you two now.

51:54.459 --> 51:58.129
His two big boys
playing Scooby-Doos.

51:59.506 --> 52:03.467
Am I gonna have to go around you?
Talk directly to the board?

52:04.676 --> 52:06.429
Talk to the old ones?

52:08.681 --> 52:10.224
Unbelievable.

52:18.358 --> 52:19.733
- Rome?
- Yeah.

52:21.528 --> 52:23.445
Hey, I was just thinking...

52:24.197 --> 52:26.990
Do you remember when you asked
when my dad was gonna die?

52:27.909 --> 52:29.702
Yeah, that was a joke, Roman.

52:29.702 --> 52:32.372
You really couldn't push this
a week, could you?

52:32.372 --> 52:34.624
There was no part of you
that could just be like,

52:34.624 --> 52:37.960
hey, let's reschedule and move this
cause their dad just died.

52:38.544 --> 52:41.256
My sister's kinda,
she's fucked up about it

52:41.756 --> 52:43.716
and her brother's a mess
and I'm gone.

52:43.716 --> 52:46.719
I'm on the fucking, I'm dead.
It's over for me.

52:46.719 --> 52:47.928
It's okay, it's fine.

52:47.928 --> 52:52.309
But you just drag us out here,
you inhuman fucking dog man.

52:53.226 --> 52:54.601
- Crazy...
- Easy, brother.

52:54.601 --> 52:57.354
You fucking killed him too.
You're the one who did it.

52:57.354 --> 52:59.898
You did.
You drained the life out of him.

52:59.898 --> 53:02.110
You dragged this thing out
for six fucking months

53:02.110 --> 53:05.196
and then you bring us out here now.
You couldn't wait like a few days.

53:05.196 --> 53:08.699
You actually couldn't do that for us.
No idea, huh?

53:09.283 --> 53:10.660
God!

53:10.660 --> 53:12.203
- This is good.
- Shut the fuck up, man.

53:12.203 --> 53:14.247
We're not selling to you, okay?
We're not doing that.

53:14.247 --> 53:16.750
We are gonna grind you down, man.
We are sanding the gears.

53:16.750 --> 53:18.418
Every email's gonna
take like six months.

53:18.418 --> 53:20.920
We're all gonna spend hundreds
of millions of dollars and in the end,

53:20.920 --> 53:23.297
you're gonna get fucking
bored and move on.

53:23.297 --> 53:25.216
It's not happening, okay?

53:26.341 --> 53:27.885
- Really?
- Yeah.

53:28.927 --> 53:30.805
Yeah, I fucking hate you.

53:32.598 --> 53:34.392
And if you tell the board
I said any of this,

53:34.392 --> 53:36.019
I'm just gonna say
it was a negotiating tactic.

53:36.019 --> 53:38.104
And you know what?
Maybe it is, but it's not.

53:38.104 --> 53:40.022
- So fuck you!
- Wait, wait.

53:41.648 --> 53:43.567
- You just fucked yourself.
- Did I?

53:43.567 --> 53:45.487
- Good.
- Really?

53:46.446 --> 53:49.574
Did you hear what little brother said?

53:49.574 --> 53:51.492
- Did you hear it?
- Was that clear?

53:52.034 --> 53:56.289
You know, it's a negotiating tactic,
you stupid cunt.

53:56.289 --> 53:57.790
- All right.
- It is.

53:58.458 --> 54:00.085
You piece of shit!

54:01.628 --> 54:03.213
You heard that, right?

54:20.187 --> 54:23.441
It wasn't the plan,
but maybe it plays.

54:26.611 --> 54:29.029
If a deal collapses in the woods
and no one hears it,

54:29.029 --> 54:31.241
is it an SEC violation?

54:44.879 --> 54:46.755
I feel like he looks solemn.

54:47.756 --> 54:49.551
Maybe danger, maybe no deal.

54:49.551 --> 54:51.177
No, no, Ken's unreadable.

54:51.678 --> 54:54.931
It's Roman you want to eyeball.
I think they got it over the line.

54:58.518 --> 54:59.727
You.

55:01.521 --> 55:04.481
How are you?
Thanks for calling.

55:06.401 --> 55:07.693
Hey, it's Matsson.

55:08.987 --> 55:11.072
- Matsson?
- Yep, yep.

55:12.449 --> 55:13.700
Okay.

55:14.743 --> 55:15.993
Well, thank you.

55:16.952 --> 55:19.580
I'd be glad to pass
that message along.

55:19.580 --> 55:22.834
Would you like to speak
to one of them yourself?

55:25.045 --> 55:26.212
No.

55:27.421 --> 55:30.466
Revised offer, 192.

55:32.676 --> 55:35.347
5 dollar bump, okay!

55:35.347 --> 55:38.349
- He really wanted ATN.
- Hey, it's a home run, boys.

55:38.349 --> 55:41.560
- Hail the conquering heroes.
- Your dad would be really proud.

55:41.560 --> 55:44.480
- You're welcome.
- 192, amazing.

55:44.480 --> 55:45.774
Very good. Excellent.

55:45.774 --> 55:48.817
Let's run the numbers
and take it to the board. Shall we?

55:48.817 --> 55:50.944
Good, good, yeah, terrific.

55:50.944 --> 55:53.782
192, it's undeniable.

55:53.782 --> 55:55.283
192.

55:55.283 --> 55:59.537
We came, we saw, we pillaged.
We raided the Vikings.

56:00.455 --> 56:02.206
Are you kidding me?

56:02.206 --> 56:04.333
- Great job, guys.
- Thanks.

56:04.333 --> 56:06.001
Thanks, Jess.

56:08.380 --> 56:10.547
So there's apparently a deal.

56:11.883 --> 56:14.385
- Deal?
- Yeah, Matsson takes ATN.

56:14.385 --> 56:16.221
Whole caboodle.

56:17.806 --> 56:19.307
Okay.

56:20.516 --> 56:23.769
Come on, Tom, you can be happy.
It's the great escape.

56:23.769 --> 56:27.773
Well, we'll see.

56:29.275 --> 56:32.152
Yeah, we're looking
at some moves at ATN.

56:33.153 --> 56:34.738
I'm not happy.

56:37.033 --> 56:39.284
Okay, you're really gonna do this?

56:39.284 --> 56:40.704
Yeah.

56:40.704 --> 56:43.038
Cyd's getting too close to Mencken.

56:43.790 --> 56:47.710
She's a little bit power crazed
post-dad,

56:47.710 --> 56:49.294
so she's gotta go.

56:50.295 --> 56:51.631
You think?

56:52.381 --> 56:53.675
Yeah, you wanna let her know?

56:53.675 --> 56:56.093
Sure, yeah.

56:57.052 --> 56:59.389
Don't get an erection, Tom.
It's weird.

57:01.265 --> 57:03.392
You wanna get dinner
when we get back?

57:04.810 --> 57:07.314
- Well, I don't know.
- Hang on.

57:08.939 --> 57:10.358
Important call.

57:11.734 --> 57:13.652
- Hey.
- Are you with your brothers?

57:16.489 --> 57:19.242
Can you send me a photo
of their faces?

57:20.617 --> 57:21.994
Yeah, sure.

57:28.168 --> 57:30.377
Congrats, congrats, congrats!

57:30.961 --> 57:33.964
What's going on there?
What is that?

57:33.964 --> 57:36.800
Is that the kill list?
It is, isn't it?

57:39.345 --> 57:40.513
Yeah, yes, it is.

57:41.514 --> 57:45.642
Early draft, GoJo finance list
of potential severance costs.

57:46.227 --> 57:49.605
It's highly provisional, it's caveated,
it's subject to change.

57:49.605 --> 57:51.315
It would just be an interpretation.

57:51.315 --> 57:53.610
Come on, Gerri,
don't leave us hanging.

57:53.610 --> 57:56.196
- Who's on it?
- Okay, if you insist.

57:57.946 --> 57:59.908
In seemingly no particular order,

58:00.699 --> 58:04.621
just potentially surplus
to requirements are Ray...

58:04.621 --> 58:06.330
God fucking damn it!

58:07.373 --> 58:09.500
- Mark.
- Shit!

58:10.877 --> 58:14.254
- Hugo.
- That slalom motherfucker!

58:14.254 --> 58:17.050
- Frank.
- Naturally, it's just speculation.

58:17.509 --> 58:19.009
Karl.

58:19.843 --> 58:21.470
Let the good times roll.

58:21.470 --> 58:23.306
Wait, what about Karolina?

58:24.181 --> 58:27.435
She's not on the list, so retained.

58:27.435 --> 58:29.269
- Retained?
- And you? Congratulations.

58:29.269 --> 58:32.356
- Also not on the list.
- Tom, what about Tom?

58:32.356 --> 58:34.317
Tom must be on the list.

58:34.317 --> 58:36.110
- Oh my God.
- I don't see him.

58:36.110 --> 58:38.947
Great fucking trip,
highly fucking productive.

58:38.947 --> 58:41.032
So much for being raised by wolves.

58:41.491 --> 58:44.493
- Congratulations, you guys!
- Nothing to it.

58:45.662 --> 58:47.330
- 192.
- You did it.
