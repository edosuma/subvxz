01:19.310 --> 01:21.222
I had the weirdest dream,

01:21.913 --> 01:24.837
that there was this rapping at my window at 4 o’clock in the morning

01:24.863 --> 01:27.628
followed by my boyfriend, who has his own apartment by the way,

01:27.832 --> 01:29.613
asking if he can crash in my room.

01:30.541 --> 01:31.375
Wait a second.

01:32.595 --> 01:33.864
I had to get out of there.

01:35.534 --> 01:39.276
Did I mention this is a recurring dream? This is, what? Like the fourth time in two weeks?

01:40.443 --> 01:43.433
Not that I’m complaining but it does defeat the purpose of having your own place.

01:43.501 --> 01:45.768
Tim keeps bringing over all these hot chicks.

01:46.428 --> 01:49.127
Which is a problem because none of them are you.

01:52.025 --> 01:56.229
That place is like party central. It’s not even my party.

01:56.371 --> 01:58.549
Well maybe it should be. Oh we should throw our own party,

01:58.609 --> 02:01.338
like a take-back-the-party party.

02:01.701 --> 02:04.820
Alright. Let’s do it. How about this Saturday?

02:05.162 --> 02:06.340
Sounds good! I’m free.

02:06.586 --> 02:09.330
Done. You’ve got to plan it though.

02:09.382 --> 02:12.873
And make sure it’s kind of low-key. Just a few friends, you know.

02:12.971 --> 02:15.153
Okay. So much fun!

02:15.740 --> 02:18.465
Now crawl back out the window before my parents wake up and hear you.

02:18.593 --> 02:20.278
Hear what? This?

02:21.513 --> 02:23.944
Oh shoot! Just don’t tickle me!

02:24.897 --> 02:25.674
Hey, Peyton.

02:26.181 --> 02:26.832
What’s up?

02:27.219 --> 02:30.163
Nathan and I are having a little thing at his place on Saturday.

02:30.236 --> 02:31.833
Haley James, party girl.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.353
Yeah it’s not going to be that big of a deal but he said that I could invite who ever I want,

02:34.404 --> 02:35.571
- so do you want to come?
- Hell yeah!

02:35.638 --> 02:36.886
- Alright, I’ll see you there.
- Later.

02:41.733 --> 02:42.482
Hey, Keith.

02:43.113 --> 02:44.649
That’s Mr. Scott.

02:45.913 --> 02:47.644
What I can’t call you Keith anymore?

02:48.079 --> 02:49.246
No, I’m just trying it out.

02:49.753 --> 02:54.234
What do you think of me as a teacher? High School auto shop.

02:54.361 --> 02:56.798
Well, I think you’d be great. Why?

02:57.084 --> 02:59.799
Because I have an interview tomorrow at a school in Charleston.

03:01.362 --> 03:02.205
Wow.

03:03.609 --> 03:07.033
When you said you planned on leaving, I didn’t realize it would be this fast.

03:07.171 --> 03:10.454
Well, no reason to wait. Right?

03:13.029 --> 03:13.777
Hey, Keith.

03:14.765 --> 03:17.685
Hey, Luke. Tell me you’re going to practice.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.624
Therapist says I’m ready to go.

03:19.710 --> 03:21.185
Now that’s what I’m talking about.

03:23.990 --> 03:26.038
You didn’t tell him about my proposal, did you?

03:26.279 --> 03:27.945
I was kind of wrestling with that.

03:31.231 --> 03:32.849
Should I tell him you plan on leaving town?

03:33.673 --> 03:35.128
No, I’ll do it.

03:36.608 --> 03:37.746
He’s going to miss you.

03:39.449 --> 03:40.279
Yeah.

03:48.555 --> 03:49.817
Knock it down, Lucas.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.152
Keep shooting, man. It will come.

04:17.470 --> 04:18.428
See you guys later.

04:19.708 --> 04:21.514
Well, the good news is I’m back.

04:22.186 --> 04:23.937
Bad news is, I suck.

04:25.945 --> 04:28.718
- You okay?
- Yeah, it’s just a little tight.

04:29.072 --> 04:29.636
Here.

04:30.782 --> 04:34.735
You’re just rusty. Pretty soon you’ll really suck. Just like before.

04:36.824 --> 04:37.637
Better?

04:41.580 --> 04:45.631
You know I’d tell you two to get a room, but then you’ve already done that.

04:51.139 --> 04:51.754
Brooke!

04:53.049 --> 04:54.743
Brooke, we got to stop doing this.

04:54.857 --> 04:59.080
Fine, I’ll stop talking to you and you can definitely stop talking to me.

04:59.147 --> 04:59.787
Okay.

05:02.665 --> 05:04.879
I mean we’re not really friends anymore, are we?

05:05.511 --> 05:07.841
You know, for a fake blonde you catch on slow.

05:08.845 --> 05:12.393
Alright, I tried apologizing to you and I’m done trying now.

05:12.736 --> 05:15.762
Good. I mean it’s really pretty pathetic.

05:17.151 --> 05:20.570
Fine, if that’s what you want. Fine.

05:33.531 --> 05:34.666
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:35.889 --> 05:36.994
I got everything but the drinks.

05:38.357 --> 05:43.195
Make it BYOB. Or BYOT. Get it? Tim? “T”.

05:45.738 --> 05:48.126
You know, if you need some cash I’ve got some from selling the car.

05:48.213 --> 05:51.320
No, this party’s totally on me. But listen, I ran into some extra people

05:51.372 --> 05:54.392
and I didn’t want to say no. But it’s going to be low-key, I promise.

05:54.736 --> 05:55.918
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:01.341 --> 06:02.012
What?

06:02.641 --> 06:04.033
You’re just lucky Tim’s here.

06:04.382 --> 06:06.701
Cause I’ve got a thing for girls named Haley James.

06:07.342 --> 06:10.137
Really? Well you’re lucky Tim’s here too.

06:11.873 --> 06:13.695
- Tim, go home.
- Tim, go home.

06:13.802 --> 06:14.704
What?

06:15.682 --> 06:19.557
Um, I’ve got more stuff in the car, so go play. I’ll kiss you later.

06:19.644 --> 06:20.305
Alright.

06:27.337 --> 06:29.276
Damn, she sure was a surprise.

06:30.075 --> 06:35.440
It’s like everything you touch turns cool. You’re like King Midol, or something.

06:35.523 --> 06:36.849
Were you playing this whole time!

06:36.935 --> 06:38.327
Yeah. Your team sucks.

06:43.541 --> 06:44.497
Hey, Mr. Scott.

06:48.411 --> 06:49.822
I win. See ya.

06:53.485 --> 06:54.841
How’s my wife?

06:58.541 --> 07:00.355
You want to tell me why some guy I’ve never seen before

07:00.416 --> 07:02.663
came in to put a security system in a new mustang?

07:02.740 --> 07:05.024
A mustang I thought I had given to you as a gift!

07:05.378 --> 07:06.467
Cause I sold it.

07:06.785 --> 07:07.820
You had no right to do that.

07:07.911 --> 07:10.677
Dad look, I’ve got expenses now. Like rent.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.692
Uh uh, no, you don’t get that as an out. I’m offering you a home.

07:13.743 --> 07:15.207
You turn me down, you’re on your own.

07:15.443 --> 07:18.633
I want the rest of the money from the sale. I’ll take cash or a check.

07:18.904 --> 07:22.053
Or you can keep the money, and come home with me now.

07:31.608 --> 07:32.836
Thanks for stopping by, Dad.

07:34.879 --> 07:36.292
We should do this more often.

07:48.214 --> 07:50.640
We’re just trying to keep it small, so don’t advertise.

07:50.692 --> 07:54.090
Oh hey, our lips are sealed. Thanks for the invite, Haley. You rock.

07:54.175 --> 07:54.843
Sure.

07:56.335 --> 07:57.162
Hi, friend.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.666
- Hey, Brooke.
- So when’s the party?

07:59.831 --> 08:02.574
Well, it’s Saturday night, but...

08:03.117 --> 08:05.273
Don’t worry, I’m not going to tip off the paparazzi.

08:05.335 --> 08:09.482
Oh no, I’m not worried, we’re just trying to keep it small. So.

08:09.933 --> 08:11.509
Peyton said not to invite me.

08:11.596 --> 08:13.557
No, she didn’t. Not exactly.

08:14.459 --> 08:18.590
Alright. You know, have your little party, and play your naked twister, and...

08:18.657 --> 08:20.786
Brooke, it’s really just going to be couple of friends.

08:21.648 --> 08:24.400
Right, but I’m not one of them.

08:25.328 --> 08:26.444
Whatever.

08:30.982 --> 08:32.844
What kind of experience do you have to have to work at a mall?

08:33.684 --> 08:35.179
I don’t know. Some.

08:36.807 --> 08:40.299
Okay, you want a smoothie? On me?

08:41.097 --> 08:43.001
What do you want? A fruit frolic with protein?

08:43.479 --> 08:45.076
How about something with cash in it.

08:47.392 --> 08:48.445
Actually.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.087
Food service?

08:53.493 --> 08:54.252
Pen.

08:58.818 --> 08:59.981
Nathan Scott.

09:01.158 --> 09:02.172
Can you start now?

09:03.923 --> 09:04.665
Yeah.

09:05.367 --> 09:06.463
Well, that was easy.

09:14.732 --> 09:17.133
Hey. I got your Blackout CD.

09:17.752 --> 09:18.797
I forgot I had it.

09:19.247 --> 09:20.180
Thank you.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.055
So you smell that?

09:25.469 --> 09:26.180
What?

09:27.040 --> 09:28.296
That scent in the air.

09:28.904 --> 09:30.209
I think it’s called guilt.

09:31.213 --> 09:32.416
Brooke and I called it quits today.

09:32.908 --> 09:33.717
That sucks.

09:33.957 --> 09:36.864
Yeah. Usually girls don’t break up,

09:36.942 --> 09:39.431
we kind of just bitch and bicker until we can work it out.

09:39.992 --> 09:41.357
I’m sorry, Peyton.

09:41.802 --> 09:44.095
Yeah, me too. I’m going to miss her.

09:44.765 --> 09:47.422
Anyway I’m glad you came by, I was actually going to call you.

09:47.571 --> 09:48.335
Why, what’s up?

09:48.641 --> 09:51.033
Haley’s party. Are you going?

09:51.657 --> 09:55.051
Yeah. How great is that, huh? I don’t think Haley’s ever thrown a party.

09:55.349 --> 09:56.342
Do you want to go together?

09:57.582 --> 09:59.219
Not like a date or anything.

09:59.721 --> 10:01.678
Okay, how exactly does that work?

10:01.876 --> 10:05.543
Let’s see, um, we don’t make out. But we don’t argue.

10:05.631 --> 10:07.411
I think we kind of just have fun.

10:08.928 --> 10:13.739
Look we’re friends, okay? And it would really be great if we could just be friends.

10:14.022 --> 10:15.052
What about Brooke?

10:15.174 --> 10:16.725
Hang out with her, date her, whatever.

10:17.027 --> 10:19.147
You know, but you and I shouldn’t have to avoid each other.

10:22.271 --> 10:22.957
Okay.

10:23.708 --> 10:25.326
- Haley’s party.
- Great.

10:25.594 --> 10:28.205
So, what are you listening to, huh?

10:28.572 --> 10:32.775
Actually, I’m on this big 80’s metal kick. I just picked up this rat album.

10:33.116 --> 10:35.398
It’s outstanding. Check it out.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.745
Excuse me, can I get a napkin, here?

11:02.068 --> 11:04.080
Yeah, just hang on a second.

11:05.627 --> 11:07.593
Here you go, sir, I’m sorry about that.

11:07.762 --> 11:08.468
Thank you.

11:10.516 --> 11:12.595
Customers first, Scott. Pulp.

11:12.798 --> 11:13.460
What?

11:13.582 --> 11:16.174
P.U.L.P. Performance Understanding Leadership People.

11:16.235 --> 11:17.808
Pulp. The Hot and Twisted way.

11:18.129 --> 11:20.709
Isn’t that what they used to call your mom? Hot and Twisted.

11:21.268 --> 11:24.796
You might be a big star at school but here I’m your boss.

11:25.888 --> 11:27.648
Wait, you got to Tree Hill?

11:27.785 --> 11:29.205
I’m in your history class.

11:30.879 --> 11:33.931
Okay here’s some more recent history. Homecoming last year.

11:33.981 --> 11:37.832
You and a few of your Ravens buddies kicked my ass just for fun. Ring a bell?

11:39.418 --> 11:40.336
Kind of.

11:42.521 --> 11:43.265
Sorry.

11:57.532 --> 11:58.650
Who’s the tie for?

11:58.993 --> 12:01.860
It’s for Keith. He’s got a job interview coming up.

12:04.377 --> 12:06.054
He’s thinking of moving, Luke.

12:08.053 --> 12:08.998
Why?

12:09.797 --> 12:11.046
He can’t get a job here?

12:12.912 --> 12:15.741
I don’t think he wants a job here.

12:20.927 --> 12:21.758
Mom.

12:23.831 --> 12:26.038
Keith proposed to me and I said no.

12:33.181 --> 12:34.343
I got to go see him.

12:42.165 --> 12:43.390
Hey, Luke, what’s up?

12:44.004 --> 12:44.706
Keith.

12:47.485 --> 12:48.541
I’m sorry, man.

12:49.432 --> 12:50.291
That’s okay.

12:51.767 --> 12:52.999
Mom told me what happened.

12:54.291 --> 12:55.305
Said you're leaving.

12:56.503 --> 12:57.694
We’ll see.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.544
Why didn’t you tell me?

12:59.964 --> 13:03.916
Well as hard as it was that your mom turned me down,

13:04.715 --> 13:06.460
the thought of leaving you is even harder.

13:07.582 --> 13:10.173
I don’t want to be the second Scott brother to do this to you.

13:10.506 --> 13:12.477
Yeah but you know that I don’t see you that way.

13:14.023 --> 13:16.393
Look, I know that Mom said no.

13:17.357 --> 13:19.092
But does that mean that you have to go?

13:19.917 --> 13:21.580
It’s time for me to move on, Luke.

13:22.928 --> 13:26.167
It’s just something I’ve got to do. Whether I get this job or not.

13:27.360 --> 13:31.733
But look, where ever I end up, you can always call or visit.

13:33.114 --> 13:35.276
I’ll always be a guy you can turn to.

13:37.498 --> 13:38.363
I know.

13:40.524 --> 13:42.814
And I want you to have what you want, you know?

13:45.378 --> 13:49.525
But, I wanted you to be my dad, too.

14:01.718 --> 14:04.051
They were so much simpler then.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.702
You nostalgic for sleepless nights?

14:07.763 --> 14:12.976
Well let’s see, my husband won’t divorce me, but my son didn’t have to think twice about it.

14:13.456 --> 14:15.167
Oh, Deb, I’m sorry.

14:17.417 --> 14:22.114
You know, I was sitting alone in that big empty house

14:22.897 --> 14:27.531
and it occurred to me, that on my long list of dumb decisions,

14:28.674 --> 14:32.068
turning down your partnership offers was one of the dumbest.

14:34.152 --> 14:35.714
Any chance it still stands?

14:35.954 --> 14:37.408
Of course it does.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.670
Good. Then let’s do it.

14:40.721 --> 14:41.505
Alright.

14:42.222 --> 14:47.060
Well, I’m off to tell Dan that he’s got 24 hours to clear out his things or they go to Good Will.

14:47.147 --> 14:49.030
Or else I could help you burn them.

14:50.142 --> 14:51.698
You look nice.

14:52.047 --> 14:52.768
Thank you.

14:55.322 --> 14:56.045
Bye Deb.

14:56.962 --> 14:57.679
Bye.

15:01.856 --> 15:04.007
I wanted to give this to you before your interview.

15:04.224 --> 15:05.165
Oh thanks.

15:05.375 --> 15:07.457
But employee daycare called.

15:09.178 --> 15:10.685
Oh, that’s great.

15:11.129 --> 15:12.030
It’s for good luck.

15:12.589 --> 15:13.623
I’ll get this off.

15:14.052 --> 15:15.978
I already tied it up for you.

15:17.007 --> 15:19.986
You know, Lucas came by to see me last night.

15:20.191 --> 15:21.790
Yeah, he said he was going to.

15:22.050 --> 15:27.912
It really meant a lot to me. And I think he’s going to be okay.

15:28.480 --> 15:33.294
Even if I do get the job, I’m less than three hours away, so he can always visit me.

15:33.597 --> 15:35.817
Here, let me help you with that collar.

15:36.242 --> 15:38.947
There you go. Aren’t you cute.

15:51.035 --> 15:52.557
There, that’s better.

15:54.071 --> 15:54.731
Perfect.

15:57.431 --> 16:00.057
Well, I guess I should be going.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.577
You’re going to do great.

16:02.561 --> 16:03.379
Thanks again.

16:06.248 --> 16:07.030
Good luck.

16:07.726 --> 16:08.416
Bye.

16:09.283 --> 16:11.807
Hey. So how goes day two?

16:12.067 --> 16:14.813
Well, I’m mopping, Hales. And I look cool doing it.

16:15.170 --> 16:15.896
I’m sure you do.

16:16.036 --> 16:18.738
I said no cell phones, you’ve got customers, Scott.

16:20.009 --> 16:22.350
Alright, I got to go. Duty calls.

16:22.738 --> 16:23.952
Did you clean the blenders yet?

16:24.162 --> 16:24.940
No, but...

16:25.114 --> 16:26.957
I told you to do that half an hour ago.

16:27.096 --> 16:28.109
Okay relax.

16:28.273 --> 16:31.621
I can’t relax. Unlike you, I actually need this job.

16:32.907 --> 16:33.727
What does that mean?

16:35.338 --> 16:38.528
It means some of us don’t have a rich daddy waiting for them when things get tough.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.938
You know, if I want to go to college I’m going to have to pay for it,

16:41.011 --> 16:44.089
so if you’re just going to waste my time you might as well quit now.

16:44.299 --> 16:45.312
That’s not what I’m doing.

16:45.389 --> 16:48.472
Good. Cause Jerry called in sick. I’m going to need you to cover till 10 o’clock

16:48.527 --> 16:50.903
- then we clean up and do inventory.
- Look, I have plans tonight,

16:50.954 --> 16:52.828
Alright, then you’re fired. Take your pick.

16:56.044 --> 17:00.540
Well, selling the shop really couldn’t be avoided.

17:01.041 --> 17:04.329
I’m curious why you quit so soon after they hired you on.

17:05.946 --> 17:10.083
Well, the new management was taking things in a different direction.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.722
And you had a problem with that?

17:11.912 --> 17:15.700
The new management was my brother. And he’s an ass.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.353
I see.

17:19.422 --> 17:23.364
Mr. Scott, you may be qualified from a technical standpoint,

17:23.492 --> 17:26.007
but teaching teenagers is a whole other thing.

17:27.409 --> 17:28.664
Why do you want this job?

17:29.646 --> 17:33.847
To me, it’s not about teaching them to change a spark plug.

17:34.233 --> 17:39.765
It’s about giving them the confidence to do something that maybe they think they couldn’t do before.

17:39.893 --> 17:43.671
And once you do that, you’ve earned their trust.

17:44.116 --> 17:47.485
And when you have that, you can really have an effect.

17:51.648 --> 17:53.041
My brother’s an ass too.

18:09.147 --> 18:10.484
Somebody’s early.

18:18.054 --> 18:22.312
Hi, you know, Nathan’s not even back from work yet so if you want to come back later.

18:22.455 --> 18:24.994
Somebody’s got to kick this mother off.

18:26.661 --> 18:27.713
What up, Nose?

18:28.759 --> 18:29.557
It’s mouth.

18:33.909 --> 18:36.597
Wow. You’re kind of hot.

18:37.544 --> 18:38.286
Yeah?

18:39.787 --> 18:44.088
So look, I know we’re just hanging out, but I got you a gift.

18:44.318 --> 18:45.532
Dude, you shouldn’t have.

18:45.644 --> 18:46.704
I know, but I did.

18:46.888 --> 18:49.775
Alright, well good. Give it to me, I love gifts.

18:50.052 --> 18:52.049
Well I know how you’re into this whole 80’s metal thing.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.919
So I got you the first test of the record.

18:56.115 --> 18:58.388
Oh! This is sweet.

18:59.017 --> 19:04.757
Um, I got you a high five. Do you want it now or later?

19:04.808 --> 19:05.878
- Now is good.
- Okay.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.747
No one’s coming, I’m sure of it.

19:11.556 --> 19:13.547
Most people don’t want to be first at a party.

19:18.131 --> 19:19.318
Nathan’s late too.

19:20.153 --> 19:21.192
Oh finally!

19:24.146 --> 19:27.111
What’s up! Party in the House.

19:28.673 --> 19:29.477
Um, Tim?

19:32.407 --> 19:33.700
Do you know any of these people?

19:34.469 --> 19:38.190
Not really, but it’s a party, Haley. You wanted people to show up, right?

19:38.738 --> 19:42.234
Yeah, sure. Yeah, cool.

19:42.329 --> 19:43.547
Cool, okay.

20:03.908 --> 20:04.856
Buy you a drink?

20:06.961 --> 20:09.730
Okay, guy in need of a clue. Here’s one.

20:09.890 --> 20:12.603
Women send signals. That was a brush off.

20:12.771 --> 20:17.512
Before you dip into your shallow pool of wit let me paint us a picture and save us both the trouble.

20:17.778 --> 20:21.174
Here’s your evening. You are going to slink back off to your buddies,

20:21.247 --> 20:24.835
laugh this off, get wasted, go home, and make nice with yourself.

20:24.885 --> 20:29.360
But don’t be thinking of me, because even your fantasy of me, isn’t interested in you.

20:35.678 --> 20:39.228
Nice work. Extra points for style.

20:40.036 --> 20:42.054
I’ve seen you around. You’re Jake’s ex, right?

20:42.457 --> 20:45.150
No, he’s mine. You go to Tree Hill?

20:49.021 --> 20:51.991
So what brings you out into the big, bad, real world?

20:52.072 --> 20:54.613
Anger, alcohol and a fake ID.

20:54.700 --> 20:55.913
Nice combo. Men?

20:56.129 --> 20:58.537
Dogs. Two of them.

20:58.811 --> 21:02.452
Ex boyfriend and backstabbing ex girly best friend.

21:02.534 --> 21:07.460
Typical. If you have a strand of hair and five minutes I can show you a great curse you can put on them.

21:07.548 --> 21:08.477
Okay.

21:10.690 --> 21:11.986
Bring it on, witch.

21:13.722 --> 21:15.585
Okay. What are their names?

21:15.907 --> 21:18.288
Lucas, and Peyton.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.147
And where are they tonight?

21:23.286 --> 21:27.474
They are at a party that I was not invited to. Can you believe that?

21:27.607 --> 21:32.098
They sneak around like little mongrels and I get removed from the A list.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.654
Can I get you ladies anything?

21:33.879 --> 21:37.714
Yeah, two vodkas. And two for my new friend here.

21:40.872 --> 21:42.328
Now you’re talking, witchiepoo.

21:52.460 --> 21:53.591
Nice move, all-star.

22:00.304 --> 22:01.440
You know, it’s a shame.

22:02.126 --> 22:05.495
I have pictures of you in your first bath, your first hair cut.

22:06.432 --> 22:09.627
The first time you walked. Here it is, your first job, and me without a camera.

22:10.057 --> 22:12.693
Of course if I did have a picture of you mom would most likely take it in the divorce.

22:12.740 --> 22:14.287
But that probably sounds bitter.

22:14.455 --> 22:16.549
Dad, I’m trying to work here, okay?

22:16.708 --> 22:19.038
I can see that. But come on, Nate.

22:19.253 --> 22:21.691
How long are you going to keep this job? A month? A week?

22:22.319 --> 22:24.107
Come home with me, this is embarrassing.

22:24.337 --> 22:27.327
No, dad, watching you and mom fight is embarrassing.

22:27.999 --> 22:30.922
This might be the ground floor but at least I’m doing it on my own.

22:31.839 --> 22:32.949
Unlike some.

22:33.315 --> 22:34.377
Meaning what?

22:34.962 --> 22:37.075
I could just live off mom's money like you did.

22:39.150 --> 22:42.477
Okay. Alright you’ve got a lot to learn, kid but go ahead.

22:42.832 --> 22:44.228
Impress me.

22:48.319 --> 22:48.873
Dad.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.120
Have a pretzel.

22:53.225 --> 22:54.161
It’s on me.

23:09.363 --> 23:13.095
Nathan Scott and your own apartment. You have, like, the best life ever.

23:13.966 --> 23:17.217
Well, thanks, I mean it’s not my apartment, but...

23:18.529 --> 23:19.122
Hi!

23:20.167 --> 23:22.870
- Haley, who are all these people?
- Who cares? It’s a party.

23:23.786 --> 23:24.713
Sorry I’m late.

23:26.341 --> 23:28.589
Hope nobody minds, but I brought a friend.

23:29.874 --> 23:31.241
Let the games begin.

23:47.184 --> 23:48.930
Maybe if we just invited her.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.059
It’s not your fault, Hales.

23:53.149 --> 23:54.731
Who is this Nikki person anyway?

23:54.794 --> 23:58.786
It’s Jake’s baby’s mom. Yeah. She’s a train wreck.

24:02.982 --> 24:04.234
That did not sound good.

24:06.090 --> 24:08.003
Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me.

24:14.171 --> 24:16.461
I like a guy who can keep a secret.

24:18.150 --> 24:19.446
You asked me not to say anything.

24:20.562 --> 24:22.683
- So where’s Jake?
- Working tonight.

24:23.192 --> 24:27.843
Really? Then we’ll just have to have all fun.

24:30.018 --> 24:32.195
Know if they have a carousel in this place?

24:32.374 --> 24:38.001
Look, Nikki, you asked me to do you a favor, and I did it. Okay?

24:38.328 --> 24:42.087
I didn’t tell Jake what happened. Now it’s your turn to do me a favor, okay?

24:42.143 --> 24:45.608
Take Brooke and get her out of here before she starts something. Alright?

24:45.654 --> 24:47.437
My friend, Haley, she doesn’t need this tonight, alright?

24:47.590 --> 24:50.315
Need what? Just having a little fun.

24:54.323 --> 24:55.854
I thought I smelled something.

24:56.746 --> 25:01.183
Oh that’s skank. And I think it’s coming from you.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.184
Come on, Lucas.

25:09.044 --> 25:10.246
Please.

25:18.881 --> 25:20.584
You don’t remember it, do you?

25:21.886 --> 25:22.730
Homecoming.

25:23.493 --> 25:25.803
I remember it. I told you I’m sorry.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.177
What do you need this job so bad for anyway?

25:30.907 --> 25:32.155
You saw my dad, right?

25:33.574 --> 25:38.432
If I can't show a judge that I can support myself, I’ve got to live with that guy.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.858
Wow, then you better hope that I don’t fire you.

25:45.228 --> 25:46.631
Alright, here’s the deal, man.

25:47.452 --> 25:51.807
I’m going to work hard because I need this job. Not because you’re gunning for me.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.176
So you can either let it go and accept my apology,

25:55.827 --> 25:57.572
or you can just fire me right now.

26:01.105 --> 26:03.706
Alright, I’ll let it go, but you’ve got to do better, man.

26:03.972 --> 26:06.998
I will. Pulp, all the way, man.

26:10.961 --> 26:14.744
Okay, you can take off. You’re having a party tonight, right?

26:15.558 --> 26:17.387
Well everyone at school knows about it.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.124
- You can stop by if you want.
- Right, right.

26:21.195 --> 26:23.935
Pry your lips off my ass and get out of here. I’ll see you tomorrow.

26:26.106 --> 26:27.002
Thanks, Gary.

26:28.665 --> 26:29.521
Whatever.

26:35.952 --> 26:37.103
It’s not gonna fill itself.

26:43.909 --> 26:45.199
So, you’re hanging out with Nikki.

26:45.665 --> 26:46.704
Sorry, do I know you?

26:47.165 --> 26:49.285
Look, Brooke, just don’t cause any trouble tonight, okay?

26:50.262 --> 26:53.861
Wait a minute, you’re that tallish lying person I used to be friends with.

26:54.112 --> 26:57.037
Why don’t you go crawling back to the boyfriend formally known as mine.

26:57.236 --> 27:02.017
Okay, this whole not being friends with you thing, is getting so much easier every time I see you.

27:18.029 --> 27:21.238
Hey, you’ve reached Haley James, congratulations.

27:29.866 --> 27:30.753
You’re late.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.625
Are you going to divide those up too?

27:34.173 --> 27:36.153
And deprive you of your glory days?

27:37.336 --> 27:38.632
Wouldn’t think of it.

27:40.170 --> 27:42.522
Oh, may I? Or should I pour half back?

27:43.986 --> 27:45.528
Why are we going through this charade, Deb?

27:46.296 --> 27:48.206
You’re just going to have to unpack that stuff later.

27:48.790 --> 27:50.664
Time to move out of denial, Dan.

27:51.258 --> 27:52.241
Me in denial?

27:52.937 --> 27:56.455
You’re the one sitting here creating busy work for yourself while our son gets a job at the mall.

27:56.552 --> 27:59.019
A direct result of your irrational need to rip the three of us apart.

27:59.452 --> 28:01.713
I ripped us apart?

28:02.982 --> 28:06.511
You know, Dan if I wasn’t half drunk I’d tell you to go screw yourself.

28:07.515 --> 28:08.312
Here they are.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.175
Your trophies.

28:15.281 --> 28:16.664
Congratulations.

28:18.511 --> 28:21.850
So this is what we’ve come to. Huh?

28:21.917 --> 28:24.481
Boxing up our lives, trading insults, drinking cheap wine.

28:24.539 --> 28:26.273
Oh no, the wine’s not cheap.

28:29.832 --> 28:31.051
This is our wedding crystal.

28:31.180 --> 28:33.785
No that’s yours. I broke mine.

28:36.090 --> 28:39.468
I don’t want to do this, Deb. I don’t want to divide up our lives.

28:39.545 --> 28:43.406
Dan you already did. You divided this family a long time ago.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.842
How? What did I do? What? By working hard? By building up the business?

28:46.958 --> 28:49.437
Giving you a nice life, a car in the driveway, clothes on your back.

28:49.525 --> 28:52.771
You know what, Dan? You know, keep it all. Here.

28:54.854 --> 28:55.689
You want the car?

28:57.665 --> 28:58.793
Here. Keep the keys.

28:59.422 --> 29:02.038
- You want the house? Take the house.
- Deb, stop.

29:02.160 --> 29:05.151
Here you want the clothes off my back? Here, take the clothes off my back.

29:05.208 --> 29:08.728
Deb, stop. Will you stop!?

29:08.791 --> 29:12.217
What? What else do you want, Dan?

29:12.718 --> 29:15.402
You. I want you.

29:16.917 --> 29:18.027
Don’t say that.

29:28.587 --> 29:31.263
Be careful, please. Be careful. Mouth.

29:31.798 --> 29:35.532
- Little help.
- I cannot stop the madness.

29:36.616 --> 29:39.051
Okay, you know what? Drink this, you look like you could use it.

29:41.867 --> 29:42.799
Wow!

29:44.309 --> 29:48.656
So you two are playing games. Watch out for them, they look like they might cheat.

29:48.823 --> 29:52.298
Oh you’re still here. I thought that you’d be running off to tuck in my kid.

29:52.501 --> 29:53.787
Someone’s got to.

29:53.910 --> 29:56.495
Yeah well hopefully it’s not some slutty boyfriend thief.

29:57.221 --> 29:58.183
I’ll drink to that.

29:58.414 --> 30:00.842
Look, why don’t you do what you’re really good at and disappear.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.174
You have a problem?

30:02.597 --> 30:04.896
- Wow, Nikki, she’s not worth it.
- Get off me.

30:06.210 --> 30:09.670
- I asked you if you had a problem.
- Yeah, I do. It’s called you, bitch.

30:30.139 --> 30:31.491
Haley, help me out here.

30:35.404 --> 30:38.272
Come on! Stop!

30:50.707 --> 30:53.624
- What the hell are you doing?
- Isn’t this what you wanted?

30:55.678 --> 30:57.788
Stop! You need to go!

30:59.011 --> 31:00.387
Well isn’t this sweet?

31:00.818 --> 31:03.567
Lucas Scott coming to the defense of his women.

31:03.998 --> 31:08.243
Oh, but wait. Shouldn’t that include someone else?

31:10.520 --> 31:14.289
Don’t worry, I can keep a secret too.

31:22.856 --> 31:23.961
You sure you’re okay?

31:24.089 --> 31:26.623
What did she mean by that? Someone else?

31:34.554 --> 31:36.459
She’s the girl I met in the bar.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.492
Lucas Scott betrayal train, all aboard.

31:44.400 --> 31:45.112
Move.

31:46.107 --> 31:47.739
And you called me easy.

31:53.294 --> 31:56.330
- Haley? What?
- Nathan! Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry.

31:56.423 --> 31:57.573
Whose apartment is this?

31:58.408 --> 32:01.583
It’s not going to be that hard to figure out so why don’t you just save us some time.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.766
Alright, it’s mine.

32:04.639 --> 32:08.152
Everyone else, get out of here before we start checking ID’s.

32:10.651 --> 32:13.559
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Writing you a citation.

32:13.657 --> 32:15.125
Me? I didn’t do anything!

32:15.325 --> 32:18.182
Underage drinking. Disturbing the peace.

32:18.259 --> 32:20.936
Look, sir, he had nothing to do with this. He just got here.

32:21.045 --> 32:23.871
It’s his apartment, it’s his responsibility.

32:24.431 --> 32:27.106
Great, I’m impressed. You learn that in detective school?

32:27.676 --> 32:32.267
So, you want to smart off. Fine.

32:32.719 --> 32:34.735
- You can do that from a cell.
- Come on!

32:34.787 --> 32:38.074
You want to join him? I didn’t think so.

32:38.566 --> 32:39.595
Come on, let’s go.

32:49.646 --> 32:52.594
Do you remember Christmas break, first semester?

32:55.288 --> 33:00.110
Yeah, we stayed on campus because I was afraid to tell my parents I was pregnant.

33:00.279 --> 33:04.939
We were in that dorm room for days. Everyone was gone. It was quiet.

33:06.116 --> 33:09.275
I remember thinking that maybe the world wasn’t out there anymore.

33:10.012 --> 33:11.902
Maybe it’s just the two of us.

33:12.813 --> 33:15.126
And all the trouble outside has just gone away.

33:19.417 --> 33:20.042
Great.

33:25.854 --> 33:26.580
Yeah?

33:26.892 --> 33:29.232
- Mr. Scott, this is the sheriffs department.
- What?

33:29.448 --> 33:31.721
- You’re son’s been arrested.
- Where?

33:31.880 --> 33:32.959
He's down at the station.

33:33.923 --> 33:34.624
Okay.

33:36.747 --> 33:37.712
Who was that?

33:38.137 --> 33:41.685
That was the real world. It’s still out there. I got to go.

33:45.804 --> 33:49.570
Bang up job, Nathan. Every time I blink you seem to sink to a new low.

33:49.882 --> 33:51.418
Part of me thinks I should have left you in there.

33:51.491 --> 33:52.514
Maybe you should have.

33:52.647 --> 33:55.171
This experiment of yours is over. You’re coming home.

33:55.652 --> 33:56.502
Forget it!

33:57.178 --> 33:58.521
- Now!
- No way.

33:58.678 --> 34:00.957
Hey, I brought you into this world, I promise I can take you out.

34:01.120 --> 34:01.905
Let him go.

34:03.680 --> 34:06.527
And the disappointments just keep on coming. You stay out of this.

34:06.687 --> 34:10.050
Haley, go get an officer.

34:11.320 --> 34:14.146
Let me get this straight. Your mom runs off and has a fling,

34:14.197 --> 34:17.217
I get the cops to drop the charges and now I’m the bad guy here?

34:17.330 --> 34:17.965
Dad.

34:18.835 --> 34:23.070
You might want to think before you start trying to make a case for what a great father you’ve been.

34:23.454 --> 34:25.239
What do you know about me being a father?

34:25.748 --> 34:26.762
Exactly.

34:27.735 --> 34:30.480
You know what? Why don’t you shut up and go talk to your mom.

34:30.701 --> 34:33.402
Tell her you want to know what really happened between us back then.

34:33.690 --> 34:37.426
And you. You want to ruin your life, go ahead. I’m done here.

34:49.859 --> 34:54.913
Come on, it’s late. We’ll take you home.

35:10.227 --> 35:11.691
Hey, what are you doing up?

35:11.929 --> 35:14.046
You know I can’t sleep until you’re home.

35:26.231 --> 35:28.782
You know, it meant a lot to Keith that you went to go see him.

35:31.733 --> 35:35.280
- Are we going to talk about that?
- It’s not really my place, is it?

35:37.377 --> 35:42.196
You deserve to be happy, mom. I mean, no body deserves it more.

35:44.982 --> 35:46.271
But so does Keith.

35:49.559 --> 35:52.027
I just thought that you could be happy together.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.538
You know, I love Keith very much.

35:59.711 --> 36:01.626
I’m just not in love with him.

36:03.219 --> 36:04.161
Were you ever?

36:04.839 --> 36:07.649
I guess I never really let my heart completely go there.

36:07.749 --> 36:10.919
In part because he has been a very good friend.

36:12.526 --> 36:15.401
And sometimes romance confuses a friendship.

36:16.674 --> 36:17.458
Yeah.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.556
Well I can’t tell you how to feel in your heart.

36:27.803 --> 36:29.393
It just sucks for Keith, that’s all.

36:32.644 --> 36:33.679
Goodnight, mom.

36:42.464 --> 36:43.755
Don’t worry about it.

36:47.319 --> 36:50.466
I never thought this many people would actually show up.

36:51.250 --> 36:51.915
Why?

36:52.561 --> 36:54.989
Because why would they? I mean, it’s just me.

36:56.101 --> 36:57.934
It kind of comes with the territory, you know?

36:58.684 --> 36:59.694
What territory?

37:00.396 --> 37:01.336
Popularity.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.038
This was just your coming out party.

37:20.039 --> 37:22.325
Who knew tutor girl could throw such a rager!

37:24.563 --> 37:25.370
Who knew.

37:30.979 --> 37:32.815
So thanks for sticking up for me.

37:35.301 --> 37:39.251
Nikki was kind of my responsibility, it was probably a mistake to bring her.

37:39.574 --> 37:40.413
You think?

37:42.518 --> 37:45.779
Judgment impaired by rage and cocktails, I admit it.

37:48.698 --> 37:50.197
I’m sorry.

37:52.196 --> 37:53.313
I want to call truce.

37:55.365 --> 37:56.108
A real one.

37:58.442 --> 37:59.318
Friends again?

38:02.655 --> 38:04.110
Just not enemies anymore.

38:10.029 --> 38:11.642
I was thinking about Lucas.

38:14.806 --> 38:19.234
You know, he’s just a guy, he makes mistakes like all the rest of them.

38:20.499 --> 38:21.199
Maybe.

38:23.407 --> 38:26.556
It just feels so much worse when you expect more from somebody.

38:29.059 --> 38:30.289
Yeah, I know.

38:36.198 --> 38:38.083
So that Nikki bitch is crazy.

38:45.326 --> 38:48.588
You think it’s possible you and me will ever get back to the way we were?

38:51.199 --> 38:53.448
It doesn’t feel like it sometimes.

38:56.133 --> 38:56.825
Yeah.

39:02.392 --> 39:03.472
I’m so tired.

39:05.654 --> 39:06.514
Me too.

39:13.933 --> 39:14.485
Hey.

39:15.452 --> 39:16.712
I got the job.

39:17.726 --> 39:20.568
That’s great. I knew you would.

39:20.644 --> 39:22.488
Yeah, I actually think it was the tie.

39:22.795 --> 39:24.325
I’m pretty sure it was you.

39:24.674 --> 39:30.726
Oh man, I’ll tell ya, I have felt for too long like everyone else is out there living their lives

39:30.767 --> 39:35.001
and when they said they wanted me... I felt good.

39:38.805 --> 39:39.937
So when do you start?

39:40.669 --> 39:42.154
A couple of weeks.

39:43.060 --> 39:44.142
Wow, that soon.

39:45.519 --> 39:46.797
Yeah, that soon.

39:58.654 --> 39:59.818
Weird night.

40:01.554 --> 40:02.844
You can say that.

40:03.991 --> 40:06.525
You know, I was thinking this morning that you should have this divorce.

40:09.191 --> 40:11.522
What changed your mind?

40:12.173 --> 40:14.870
I just realized the same thing I realized in the dorm room.

40:15.736 --> 40:17.564
The real world’s always going to be out there.

40:19.121 --> 40:20.252
And there’s no going back.

41:05.209 --> 41:07.249
Welcome to Hot and Twisted, how can I help you?

41:18.373 --> 41:19.482
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:21.412 --> 41:25.913
Look, I didn’t know about Nikki and Jake until I met her.

41:26.486 --> 41:29.102
So she was just some stranger in a bar you slept with?

41:30.744 --> 41:33.162
Lucas, you don’t need to apologize. Okay?

41:33.234 --> 41:37.704
It’s just that, after all the stuff that you and I had been through,

41:38.436 --> 41:42.353
where my head and my heart were at I couldn’t have gone and just slept with some stranger.

41:44.183 --> 41:47.017
You know when you and I first met? I was with Nathan.

41:47.308 --> 41:52.296
And he was a pretty bad guy, if you remember.

41:52.731 --> 41:53.412
Yeah.

41:54.436 --> 41:55.685
I’m not doing that again.

41:57.991 --> 41:59.950
Who knew that you two would switch places?
