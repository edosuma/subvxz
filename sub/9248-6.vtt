WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:05.527
Hey, honey.

00:05.614 --> 00:07.050
Whatcha doing?

00:07.137 --> 00:08.095
Just going through your
credit card bills.

00:08.182 --> 00:10.140
Uh, ye...
Coming!

00:11.620 --> 00:14.057
Nobody else is home, Molly.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.754
Have a seat.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.930
This is becoming, like,
an every month thing for you.

00:18.018 --> 00:21.325
Well, now that we're
a one-income family

00:21.412 --> 00:23.023
we really have got
to watch our spending.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.242
Hey, I've been
really good lately--

00:25.329 --> 00:27.288
no Starbucks, no manicures,

00:27.375 --> 00:29.768
I've only had one palm reading.What?

00:29.855 --> 00:31.596
See? Madam Olga said
you'd be upset.

00:33.729 --> 00:34.295
You're hilarious.

00:34.382 --> 00:35.774
[giggles]

00:35.861 --> 00:37.385
Look, I was going
over these bills,

00:37.472 --> 00:38.908
and I think there's
a few more areas

00:38.995 --> 00:40.170
where we can cut back.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.780
Let's hear it.Well, how about this

00:41.867 --> 00:43.347
"Wax On, Wax Off" place,
is that a car wash?

00:43.434 --> 00:45.610
'Cause I could do
that in the driveway.

00:45.697 --> 00:48.091
That's my bikini wax, you want
to do that in the driveway?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.095
We'll file that under
"medical expenses."

00:52.182 --> 00:55.533
Here's what we don't need--
NFL Sports Package.

00:55.620 --> 00:56.708
No, no, no, no!

00:56.795 --> 00:58.275
We both need that.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.277
If I'm not watching
football here,

01:00.364 --> 01:01.670
I'm at a bar.

01:01.757 --> 01:03.324
If I'm at a bar,
having a few beers.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.108
Now, games are Sunday,
Monday, and Thursday.

01:05.195 --> 01:08.024
Let's say at least
three beers per game,

01:08.111 --> 01:10.853
times 17 weeks...Uh-huh.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.073
plus playoffs.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.945
Saving $50 has cost you...

01:16.032 --> 01:18.165
one husband to alcoholism.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.298
Anything's better
than this.

01:21.385 --> 01:22.386
What?
What?

01:24.954 --> 01:26.782
O-Okay.

01:26.869 --> 01:29.306
Oh, here, here's
a perfect example

01:29.393 --> 01:31.047
of a luxury item
we do not need.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.266
Bottled water.

01:32.353 --> 01:33.963
Mike, we need water to live.

01:34.050 --> 01:35.225
We have it...

01:35.312 --> 01:36.183
right here.

01:36.270 --> 01:39.055
Look, and it's free.

01:39.142 --> 01:41.231
From Lake Michigan to our home.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.321
See? Perfectly good water.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.324
You gonna drink that
or paint the house with it?

01:47.411 --> 01:50.849
Well, give it a second,
you just got to let the minerals

01:50.936 --> 01:52.851
and vitamins sink to the bottom.

01:52.938 --> 01:55.767
Or-- I have another idea--
how about you drink that,

01:55.854 --> 01:56.942
I'll drink
the bottled water.

01:57.029 --> 01:58.596
It'll last twice as long.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.337
[gasps] Who just cut
our water bill in half?

02:00.424 --> 02:03.123
You're welcome.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.385
Out of water?

02:04.472 --> 02:05.125
Mine's still full.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.172
Mine will be-- let me just
swap out this dead soldier.

02:09.259 --> 02:11.087
You can't lift that jug,
let me help you with it.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.350
No, I got it,
it's my water.

02:13.437 --> 02:14.395
[sighs]

02:14.482 --> 02:16.048
I can change it.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.878
Just enjoy your
"Cloudy with a Chance of Hep C."

02:19.965 --> 02:21.880
Would you like some help?

02:21.967 --> 02:23.447
No, I got it.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.319
Oh...

02:25.406 --> 02:27.669
God...!

02:27.756 --> 02:28.931
[groans]

02:29.018 --> 02:30.976
[breathes heavily]

02:31.063 --> 02:32.369
Easy-peasy.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.329
All right, so it's
just a little...

02:35.416 --> 02:37.853
a full flip, and there we go.

02:53.129 --> 02:55.131
It's delicious.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.180
♪ La, la-ba-dee-da ♪

03:00.267 --> 03:03.183

03:15.804 --> 03:18.763

03:24.247 --> 03:27.903
Just leave the pot.
I hardly slept.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.557
Well, you should
get a body pillow.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.907
Ever since I got one,
I've been sleeping like a baby.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.343
I literally woke up
with my thumb in my mouth.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.087
Well, don't tell me
where the other thumb was,

03:38.174 --> 03:40.568
I had enough
nightmares last night.

03:40.655 --> 03:43.048
Have you heard the one
where you wake

03:43.135 --> 03:44.746
to the passionate sounds
of your roommate

03:44.833 --> 03:46.138
humping a body pillow?

03:46.574 --> 03:49.881
I told you, I was just
flipping it to the cool side.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.363
My thighs get hot.

03:53.450 --> 03:56.410
No, this dream started with
all my teeth crumbling.

03:56.497 --> 03:59.804
Oh, that usually represents
a feeling of powerlessness,

03:59.891 --> 04:01.676
like your life is falling apart.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.069
Or it could reflect
your dental hygiene.

04:04.287 --> 04:06.681
Picking your teeth
with a parking citation

04:06.768 --> 04:08.291
is not the same as flossing.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.208
After my teeth fell out,
I was suddenly in a bathroom.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.297
I sat on a pot, and money just
started pouring out of it--

04:14.384 --> 04:17.169
coins, bills, everything.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.477
But when I tried to grab it,
it all flushed away.

04:20.564 --> 04:21.391
Diarrhea money.

04:23.741 --> 04:26.004
This is a very common dream.

04:26.091 --> 04:28.485
Your loose bowels represent
a lack of control in your life.

04:28.572 --> 04:29.791
The money could be anything.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.923
Like money.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.231
Yeah! Money!

04:35.318 --> 04:36.754
At the rate me and Molly
are paying down our debt,

04:36.841 --> 04:38.278
our first home's gonna
be a nursing home.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.323
Boo-hoo.

04:40.410 --> 04:44.066
My credit rating is so bad,
I can't even get intodebt.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.197
CARL:
Mm!

04:45.285 --> 04:47.722
Praise God, someday.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.506
Yeah, I feel bad
for you guys,

04:49.593 --> 04:51.421
'cause after 37 years
of living with my grandma

04:51.508 --> 04:53.205
[chuckles] I'm flush.

04:58.559 --> 05:01.257
I'm paying for lunch, aren't I?

05:01.344 --> 05:05.827
Samuel, get me
the dessert menu.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.399
[laughs]

05:12.486 --> 05:15.967
Oh, uh-oh... Ooh...

05:16.054 --> 05:17.317
Do you want
to go in?

05:17.404 --> 05:18.840
No, no, no,
I'm fine out here.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.668
I promised Mike
I would be good,

05:20.755 --> 05:22.322
and I'm going to be good.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.672
God, those shoes
are beautiful.

05:24.759 --> 05:28.763
Oh, I think I can smell the
leather through the glass.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.854
Can't you just
try them on?

05:32.941 --> 05:34.682
No, I can't try them on.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.118
I try them on, I'm...

05:36.205 --> 05:38.250
I'm gonna buy 'em,
and, I mean...

05:38.338 --> 05:40.557
You know, I guess if
I tried on just one...

05:40.644 --> 05:42.559
you know, in maybe,
like, a size too small,

05:42.646 --> 05:44.692
then it would pinch, and
that would be a really

05:44.779 --> 05:46.520
bad shoe experience,
and I wouldn't want to...

05:46.607 --> 05:49.087
I wouldn't want to
get them, you know.

05:49.174 --> 05:51.742
B-But, if-if they run big,
and it fits perfectly,

05:51.829 --> 05:54.049
then I got, you know,
that's fate...

05:54.136 --> 05:57.095
and who am I to deal with fate,
so then I ambuying the shoe...

05:57.182 --> 05:58.880
No, you know what,
I'm-I'm just gonna st...

05:58.967 --> 06:00.751
I'm not going in.

06:00.838 --> 06:01.665
Okay, then we'll leave.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.319
No, we're not leaving.

06:03.406 --> 06:05.756
You're trying on shoes!
Get in there!

06:05.843 --> 06:08.193
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:08.280 --> 06:10.065
We don't need boots.
No, come here.

06:10.152 --> 06:12.546
These are the showstoppers.
The black ones.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.722
Yeah, they're all black.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.071
Yeah, not the ugly black ones,

06:16.158 --> 06:18.160
the amazing black ones.
These.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.640
Come on. No... no!

06:19.727 --> 06:22.164
I'm not the
bass player for KISS.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.252
Come on, one up,

06:23.339 --> 06:25.080
one up, and two over.

06:25.167 --> 06:26.298
One up, up, up, up.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.737
Two over. Two over.

06:29.824 --> 06:30.738
Two... yes.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.000
Yes, yes, yes.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.218
These are nice.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.655
Right? I know! Hello!

06:34.742 --> 06:37.353
Excuse me, do you
have these in nine?

06:37.440 --> 06:38.485
Or eight? Eight?

06:38.572 --> 06:40.008
But I'm a nine.

06:40.095 --> 06:41.662
All right, fine.
Do they run small?

06:42.532 --> 06:45.840
That's the last pair
we have and it's an eight.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.537
[gasps] Did you say eight?
'Cause I'll take 'em.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.061
I thought you weren't
gonna buy anything.

06:50.148 --> 06:52.107
I'm not, you are.
Put it on my credit cards.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.239
I was never here.
I'll meet you in the alley.

06:59.854 --> 07:01.290
Oh, God.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.248
Why did you let me
let you do something

07:03.335 --> 07:04.554
that I wasn't supposed to do?

07:04.641 --> 07:06.730
And why are you
so beautiful?

07:08.906 --> 07:11.953
I know this is weird,
coming from your stoner sister:

07:12.040 --> 07:14.303
but you've got a problem.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.696
JOYCE:
The only problem

07:15.783 --> 07:17.959
she'll have is
if Mike sees them.

07:18.046 --> 07:20.048
You want me to keep them
in my vibrator cabinet?

07:20.135 --> 07:21.658
I lock those up like guns.

07:21.745 --> 07:25.270
No. I mean, I did it,
I have to be honest

07:25.357 --> 07:26.489
and own up to my own mistakes.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.883
[door closes]
MIKE:
Molly!

07:28.970 --> 07:31.015
Oh, God, get 'em off,
get 'em off, get 'em off!

07:31.102 --> 07:32.930
Oh, oh!Hey.

07:33.017 --> 07:35.324
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, you.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.457
I stayed home
all day,

07:37.544 --> 07:38.806
I don't know what
these two did.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.986
What's up with
those two?

07:45.073 --> 07:46.596
Drunk? High? Who knows.

07:49.033 --> 07:52.167
Addiction is a problem,
and we have to be understanding.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.345
Why are you so tall?

07:56.432 --> 07:58.129
Why are you so handsome?

08:03.526 --> 08:04.527
Where are you going?Where are yougoing?

08:05.659 --> 08:07.399
What are you doing?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.489
What are youdoing?

08:09.576 --> 08:12.143
No, no.Are those new shoes?

08:12.230 --> 08:13.493
No.Really?

08:13.580 --> 08:16.234
No.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.714
How much were they?They were on sale.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.455
Really?Yes.

08:19.542 --> 08:20.587
Molly?

08:20.674 --> 08:22.414
No.You are killing me!

08:23.590 --> 08:26.331
Come on, they're
one pair of shoes.

08:26.418 --> 08:27.811
I promise I won't do it again.

08:27.898 --> 08:29.770
You say that every time.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.598
But we're drowning in debt
and it's all on my shoulders.

08:31.685 --> 08:34.601
It's not all on your shoulders,
it's on my shoulders, too.

08:34.688 --> 08:35.732
How?

08:35.819 --> 08:37.255
Are you going to work every day?

08:37.342 --> 08:38.648
No, you're just
going out and shopping

08:38.735 --> 08:40.607
and spending all of my money.

08:41.825 --> 08:42.696
Really?

08:42.783 --> 08:44.611
Oh, boy.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.482
Yourmoney? Wow.

08:46.569 --> 08:47.875
Look, I...
don't turn this on me,

08:47.962 --> 08:49.224
you're the one who
bought the stupid shoes.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.531
Got it:
stupid shoes, your money.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.663
Hey, I'm right on this one,

08:53.750 --> 08:56.231
and you're not making
me feel bad about it.

08:57.275 --> 08:59.495
Damn it!
I feel bad about it.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.029
Vince.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.857
There he is.
Have a seat, champ.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.946
Brewed a fresh pot of coffee
and made you some eggs.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.122
Why are you
making me breakfast?

09:18.209 --> 09:19.646
You got to be hungry

09:19.733 --> 09:22.213
after that ass chewing
you gave your wife.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.214
You heard about that?

09:23.301 --> 09:25.521
The whole house is abuzz.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.392
Sit down, hero.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.133
Hero.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.832
I slept on a La-Z-Boy
in the basement last night.

09:31.919 --> 09:34.051
And Jesus wore
a crown of thorns.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.099
It was just a dumb
fight about shoes.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.971
No, it was much more than that.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.059
You said, "my money."

09:42.146 --> 09:44.322
You had the balls to say

09:44.409 --> 09:46.063
what a generation of men
have wanted to

09:46.150 --> 09:47.935
since the dawn
of joint checking accounts.

09:48.022 --> 09:50.677
Morning.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.679
Morning, Moll.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.681
Nice shoes.Yeah, bite me.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.204
Just so you know,

09:56.291 --> 09:57.945
I'm going out and
getting a job today,

09:58.032 --> 09:59.903
just so I can pay you
back your precious money.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.297
Molly, you're being ridiculous.
You don't have to get a job.

10:02.384 --> 10:03.994
Oh, am I ridiculous now, too?[groans]

10:04.081 --> 10:05.909
You know what? I'm gonna
put that on my resumé

10:05.996 --> 10:07.519
under "Special Skills."

10:07.607 --> 10:09.130
VINCE:
Hey, if you're

10:09.217 --> 10:11.001
looking for a job, I got
a buddy who owns a school

10:11.088 --> 10:12.524
teaching foreigners
how to drive cars.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.962
You'd be surprised
how much money you can make

10:15.049 --> 10:17.138
exploiting the undocumented
immigrant market.

10:17.225 --> 10:21.316
I have a master's degree,
Vince, okay?

10:21.403 --> 10:24.188
I think I can get something
a little bit better than that.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.756
VINCE:
Wow.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.280
You may never
get laid again.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.078
So, do you have any skills?

10:44.165 --> 10:46.080
Uh, yeah, I was a teacher
for the Chicago school system

10:46.167 --> 10:48.169
for the last ten years, so...

10:48.256 --> 10:51.346
Oh. No skills.

10:51.433 --> 10:54.175
No, no, no, I have,
I have skills-- I can type.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.916
I'm very good with a computer.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.526
Oh, that's terrific.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.007
Uh, how do you feel
about house painting?

11:00.094 --> 11:02.052
[chuckles]
Painting.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.272
[laughs]: Well, I couldn't
start you off as a painter.

11:04.359 --> 11:07.014
No, maybe a scraper
or a prepper.

11:07.101 --> 11:09.103
A can... shaker. That...

11:09.190 --> 11:11.279
I-I have a master's degree.

11:11.366 --> 11:15.500
Well, if it's
a master's degree in...

11:15.587 --> 11:17.285
air-conditioning repair,
you're in luck.

11:17.372 --> 11:20.157
Uh, no, it's in
medieval literature.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.770
Um, I just, I just
think that I have

11:23.857 --> 11:26.860
a little more to offer the
world than manual labor.

11:26.947 --> 11:30.037
[chuckles] Well, the world
doesn't give a hot crap.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.954
Do you mind if, uh,
we get real for a second?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.695
Realer than that?

11:35.782 --> 11:36.521
Here it is:

11:36.608 --> 11:38.219
We're all screwed.

11:38.306 --> 11:42.789
If you don't have money now,
you are never getting any.

11:42.876 --> 11:44.791
Because the three guys
that have it all

11:44.878 --> 11:46.488
are not sharing.

11:46.575 --> 11:49.317
Are you sure that
you're the one

11:49.404 --> 11:52.755
I'm supposed to be talking
to about getting a job?

11:52.842 --> 11:54.322
There are no jobs.
In fact,

11:54.409 --> 11:57.629
this agency is shutting down
in two weeks.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.153
We're all getting laid off.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.765
And I just got
a fully-loaded Ford Focus.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.028
Those are nice.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.421
Yeah.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.597
Nice enough to live in?

12:10.642 --> 12:12.253
You know what, I'm just...

12:12.340 --> 12:14.821
I'm probably just gonna go.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.214
Hey, you know...
how about you...

12:17.301 --> 12:19.826
get yourself a little
treat at lunch,

12:19.913 --> 12:21.218
on me.
[nervous chuckle]

12:21.305 --> 12:22.872
Bless you.

12:22.959 --> 12:25.440
You know I'm gonna
spend this on liquor.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.530
I do.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.362
[sighs]

12:34.449 --> 12:36.799
Can't believe this
is the only job I could get.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.670
I have a master's degree.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.718
I'm just doing this so I can
get a job driving a taxi.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.415
And I have a PhD.

12:44.502 --> 12:48.028
Well, good for you, Dr. Don't
Have a Driver's License.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.681
Ten and two!

12:49.769 --> 12:51.553
That's 11 and one!
Ten and two!

12:57.211 --> 12:58.690
You know, this is me and Molly's
first big fight.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.954
Well, that's what
happens with couples.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.303
I remember our
first big fight.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.348
The day you brought
harmonica to work?

13:04.435 --> 13:05.915
No. Before that.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.308
When I snatched that second
double cheeseburger

13:07.395 --> 13:08.657
out of your hand.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.181
Oh, right,
that was a bad one.

13:11.268 --> 13:14.054
Yeah. You bit me.

13:14.141 --> 13:16.796
I let up when I realized
it wasn't hamburger.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.928
[chuckles]

13:19.015 --> 13:20.930
I-I just didn't understand
the issues that you
were going through,

13:21.017 --> 13:22.584
but you know,
I did it out of love.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.107
Oh, I know.

13:24.194 --> 13:25.935
It was right after that
that I joined OA.

13:28.633 --> 13:29.504
Molly?!

13:29.591 --> 13:30.635
She was there, too.

13:30.722 --> 13:31.941
Changed my whole life.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.813
No, Molly.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.162
Molly?

13:35.249 --> 13:36.250
Oh, you got
to be kidding me.

13:36.337 --> 13:37.817
Drive. Drive.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.122
It's a red light.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.820
Then... check both
ways, but go, go,

13:40.907 --> 13:41.429
go!

13:44.301 --> 13:45.737
Where is she going?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.435
She was looking
right at me.

13:47.522 --> 13:49.350
Wow. Never seen somebody
storm off in a Prius.

13:49.437 --> 13:53.571
Didn't make any noise,
but it sure made her point.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.183
Follow that car.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.841
Damn it, we can't
shake these clowns.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.320
Aren't we supposed to
pull over for the police?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.714
Only if there's lights
and a siren.

14:05.801 --> 14:06.715
[siren wailing]

14:06.802 --> 14:08.369
Gah!Oh.

14:08.456 --> 14:09.587
Oh, my goodness.

14:09.674 --> 14:10.762
Just keep it together,
professor,

14:10.850 --> 14:11.676
and make a left up here.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.330
Don't use your signal,

14:13.417 --> 14:14.941
they'll know
which way we're turning.

14:15.028 --> 14:16.420
Just accelerate
through the turn.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.248
Watch it.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.772
[tires squeal]

14:20.860 --> 14:22.644
I don't know why that
woman's taking classes.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.864
You see the way she
just took that corner?

14:24.951 --> 14:27.344
[amplified]: Molly, pull over,
we need to talk.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.042
The police know you?!

14:29.129 --> 14:30.565
Are you a criminal?

14:30.652 --> 14:31.348
No, I'm your one chance
out of this mess.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.655
Speed bump.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.353
MOLLY:
Aah!

14:36.440 --> 14:38.442
Speed bump.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.662
[sighs]

14:40.749 --> 14:42.185
You know, I hate to pry,

14:42.272 --> 14:43.752
but obviously,
this is a result

14:43.839 --> 14:44.971
of a lack of communication

14:45.058 --> 14:46.363
between you and
your spouse.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.235
Shut up, you.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.542
I'm just saying,
I know how you can be.

14:51.629 --> 14:52.630
Hey, I'm not
in the wrong, here.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.719
She bought the shoes.Ah.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.939
See what you did, there? Instead
of trying to find a solution,

14:57.026 --> 14:58.680
you're trying to lay blame.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.682
Really? So even when she's wrong
I don't get to be right.

15:00.769 --> 15:02.553
Like Oprah says,
"Do you want to be right

15:02.640 --> 15:03.511
or do you want
to be married?"

15:03.598 --> 15:05.469
Oprah isn't married.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.862
Well, she's got Gayle.

15:08.559 --> 15:11.040
Come on, Molly,
pull over the car, please.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.086
Please, please
let me pull over.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.653
Oh, fine. If you're gonna be
such a stickler for the law,

15:15.740 --> 15:17.438
you're never gonna make it
as a cabbie in this town.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.095
I know she's my wife,

15:22.182 --> 15:23.618
but this is still
evading arrest.

15:23.705 --> 15:24.967
Don't go in
with a hot head.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.665
Remember: listen,
acknowledge,

15:27.752 --> 15:30.320
admit, and apologize.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.583
LAAA.

15:32.670 --> 15:33.628
Oprah?

15:33.715 --> 15:35.543
Carl.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.115
Molly, what the hell
are you doing?

15:42.202 --> 15:43.812
I am trying to earn
my own money.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.640
This is ridiculous.Why?

15:45.727 --> 15:49.122
What you said is true-- the
money you make is not my money.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.080
It isyour money.No, it's not.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.865
I'm not working,
I'm just spending.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.303
Well, you're working
at trying to be a writer.[scoffs]

15:56.390 --> 15:58.522
I don't even know if I'm
good enough to be one.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.003
You are.How do you know? I...

16:01.090 --> 16:03.788
Idon't even know.
And that's what scares
the hell out of me.

16:03.875 --> 16:05.877
Then I get scared, and
I get nervous, and I...

16:05.965 --> 16:07.618
go shopping,
and if I go shopping,

16:07.705 --> 16:10.578
I buy stupid shoes, all trying
to make me feel better.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.406
[sighs]

16:12.493 --> 16:13.407
Do they make you
feel better?

16:13.494 --> 16:17.237
Yes.

16:19.195 --> 16:20.370
Then you should keep 'em.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.329
No, I can't.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.287
Yes, you can.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.420
I want you to be happy.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.552
'Cause when you're not happy,

16:28.639 --> 16:31.381
I'm miserable.

16:32.687 --> 16:35.081
In that case, there's a...

16:35.168 --> 16:38.780
there's a purse and a belt that
might put me over the moon.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.129
Don't push it.I know.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.349
You're right.
And I'm going to,

16:42.436 --> 16:44.264
I'm going to work
really hard to be better.

16:44.351 --> 16:45.787
You know what?

16:45.874 --> 16:47.397
I'm gonna give you
my credit cards.

16:47.484 --> 16:49.399
You don't have to do that.No, I want-I want to.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.619
I already canceled them.

16:51.706 --> 16:55.014
Even the ones you
don't know about?

16:55.101 --> 16:56.580
You're gonna be the death of me.[giggles]

16:59.496 --> 17:01.759
I'll see you at home.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.331
Sorry.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.941
Are we in trouble?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.422
No, no. Just take a turn
at the next light and head

17:12.509 --> 17:14.903
towards Michigan Avenue.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.514
I've got a purse and a belt
I need to return.

17:24.869 --> 17:28.569
Okay, I'd like to return these.
Uh, funny story--

17:28.656 --> 17:30.832
I got home, and my
husband had already

17:30.919 --> 17:32.312
bought me the same shoes,
the same belt

17:32.399 --> 17:34.270
and the same purse.

17:34.357 --> 17:37.230
I mean, does he
know me or what?

17:37.317 --> 17:38.796
[chuckles]

17:38.883 --> 17:39.710
You wore these.

17:39.797 --> 17:42.583
No, no, I didn't.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.063
They're still warm.

17:48.023 --> 17:50.678
All right, then take
back the purse and belt.

17:50.765 --> 17:54.073
Come on, my frickin'
marriage is on the line here.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.553
Best I can do is give you
a store credit.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.385
Okay, I'll take the
purse and the belt.
