00:01.430 --> 00:04.467
Previously, on Elementary...
This belongs to Jonathan Bloom.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.797
He was here
two nights ago.

00:05.830 --> 00:08.060
You like young woman
who do what you want

00:08.100 --> 00:10.239
in exchange for a fix,
women who,

00:10.270 --> 00:14.377
on one or two occasions, have
just... never been seen again.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.241
People don't make plans
just to break them.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.702
People don't; my father does.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.741
Dad never shows.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.748
Well, you didn't
fall last night,

00:21.780 --> 00:24.214
so now I just have
to give you a little push.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.512
It's good stuff.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.227
(grunting)

00:29.260 --> 00:31.080
(Holmes kicking, grunting)

00:31.130 --> 00:34.122
(gasping)

00:35.130 --> 00:38.258
Ithought
you might be ready to talk.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.165
Your father called.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.168
He found out
about what happened.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.508
He's gonna be here tomorrow.

00:50.610 --> 00:53.170
*

01:22.150 --> 01:24.345
(phone ringing)

01:26.280 --> 01:28.316
Whose phone is that?

01:30.420 --> 01:31.580
Mine.

01:31.620 --> 01:33.315
Sorry. Forgot.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.257
Is this seriously
all we're going to do today?

01:37.290 --> 01:39.121
Do you have
something better to do?

01:39.160 --> 01:40.092
No.

01:40.130 --> 01:43.429
But usually when you call us,
we have fun.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.267
This is not fun.

01:45.300 --> 01:46.733
Well, it could be worse.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.692
It could be 1927,

01:48.740 --> 01:50.901
and your name
could be Ruth Bixby,

01:50.940 --> 01:52.908
yours could be May Smith.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.601
One of them let a killer

01:54.640 --> 01:57.746
into this very apartment.

01:57.780 --> 02:00.715
He was never identified.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.513
So...

02:02.550 --> 02:05.189
what, this is
gonna help you catch him?

02:05.220 --> 02:09.179
Well, he's almost
certainly long dead.

02:09.230 --> 02:11.551
Recreating this crime scene

02:11.590 --> 02:14.297
might help me
ratchet in on one...

02:14.330 --> 02:17.390
of several suspects.

02:20.340 --> 02:24.663
Justice is like an orgasm--
it can never come too late.

02:24.710 --> 02:27.178
Don't you get enough
of this at work?

02:27.210 --> 02:28.734
My relationship
with the department

02:28.780 --> 02:31.340
is complicated at the moment.

02:31.380 --> 02:32.711
Complicated how?

02:32.750 --> 02:35.241
Well, several days ago,
I used heroin,

02:35.280 --> 02:37.840
and that was after I beat
a former acquaintance

02:37.890 --> 02:39.380
nearly to death.

02:39.420 --> 02:40.682
What happened?

02:40.720 --> 02:43.257
He upset me,
so I fractured his skull.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.281
Repeatedly.
Broke several of his ribs,

02:45.330 --> 02:46.752
lacerated his spleen.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.392
The district attorney

02:48.430 --> 02:49.863
is, at this very moment,

02:49.900 --> 02:51.868
deciding whether or not
I should be charged

02:51.900 --> 02:53.765
with felonious... assault.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.860
IfI am, good chance
I'll be sent to prison.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.866
So... if you don't mind,

02:58.910 --> 03:00.901
I'd really like
to complete this experiment

03:00.940 --> 03:02.544
while I still can.

03:05.450 --> 03:06.769
(phone buzzing)
Okay.

03:09.320 --> 03:10.947
WATSON:
Sherlock, it's me again.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.208
Your father is gonna be here
any second.

03:13.260 --> 03:14.409
You said you'd be here.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.655
Call me back.

03:16.690 --> 03:19.227
(doorbell rings)

03:24.400 --> 03:25.526
Hey.

03:25.570 --> 03:28.289
Morning.
I was in the neighborhood.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.968
That's so sweet.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.228
Please, come in.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.305
Is, uh, Holmes here?

03:35.340 --> 03:36.079
(Watson sighs)

03:36.110 --> 03:38.305
No. He got up early
this morning

03:38.350 --> 03:41.808
to work on a project,
but he'll be back soon.

03:41.850 --> 03:44.887
Kind of figured
you'd be with him...

03:44.920 --> 03:47.855
all the time right now.
Well,

03:47.890 --> 03:50.324
I'm not his sober companion
anymore, so if he's gonna

03:50.360 --> 03:53.295
stay clean, he has to want to do
the work himself-- he gets that.

03:53.330 --> 03:55.298
You two finally talked?

03:55.330 --> 03:56.991
(sighs):
Last night.

03:57.030 --> 03:59.339
It was good. I mean...

03:59.370 --> 04:02.430
he's disappointed
and embarrassed.

04:02.470 --> 04:05.439
But he's not the same
person he was when he
got sober the first time.

04:05.470 --> 04:07.734
He believes in the program;
he knows it can help him.

04:07.780 --> 04:08.974
He's been going to meetings?

04:09.010 --> 04:10.409
Every day.

04:10.450 --> 04:11.542
You know, when
it happened,

04:11.580 --> 04:14.617
uh, when he finally called us
to tell us where he was,

04:14.650 --> 04:17.346
and it's where Oscar Rankin
and hIS snster were,

04:17.390 --> 04:20.018
I'd never seen him so rough.

04:21.590 --> 04:23.353
He, uh...

04:23.390 --> 04:25.551
he said he'd come see me,

04:25.590 --> 04:27.399
we'd talk about it.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.921
He will,
when he's ready.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.790
Have you heard anything
from the DA?

04:31.830 --> 04:34.469
I put in a good word
with all the right people,

04:34.500 --> 04:36.604
told them about all the good
that Sherlock's done,

04:36.640 --> 04:39.370
but, uh, the department's
had a rough year.

04:39.410 --> 04:42.641
There's a perception out there
that we go too easy on our own.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.604
If the city wanted
to make an example,

04:45.650 --> 04:46.969
he's a perfect
candidate.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.488
He works with the police,
but he isn't police.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.455
The DA could come down
as hard as he wants on him,

04:52.490 --> 04:54.549
not worry about the PBA
making a fuss.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.825
(door opens)

04:57.860 --> 04:59.396
(door closes)

04:59.430 --> 05:01.455
Watson...

05:01.500 --> 05:03.092
a thousand apologies.

05:03.130 --> 05:05.496
I just received your
many voice mails.

05:05.530 --> 05:07.430
I am, of course,

05:07.470 --> 05:09.506
tumescent with questions about
your meeting with my father.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.064
So was he everything
you'd imagined?

05:12.510 --> 05:13.909
Was he driven here,
or did he arrive

05:13.940 --> 05:15.339
in a plume of black smoke?

05:17.580 --> 05:19.673
He didn't show up, did he?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.870
What is wrong with him?
Why would he tell people

05:21.920 --> 05:23.842
he's gonna be someplace
and then not show up?

05:23.890 --> 05:26.552
He doesn't tell "people,"
Watson, he tells me.

05:26.590 --> 05:28.080
You're angry.
Don't be angry.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.884
The longer he forgets I exist,
the longer we keep our home.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.079
You really think he's gonna come

05:32.130 --> 05:34.553
all the way to New York
just to kick us out?

05:34.600 --> 05:37.398
_ You recall his terms
With regards to the brownstone.

05:37.430 --> 05:40.558
IfI use, I end up
on the streets. I used.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.965
(sighs)

05:42.000 --> 05:43.558
Has the captain been here?

05:43.610 --> 05:45.566
Or have you taken
to wearing his cologne?

05:45.610 --> 05:47.635
Yeah, he brought us some food.
He said he wanted

05:47.680 --> 05:49.568
to let you know
he was thinking about you.

05:49.610 --> 05:51.703
Hmm.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.570
So, how was your day?

05:53.620 --> 05:55.440
It was productive.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.584
Went to a meeting,
then another.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.986
Saw some old friends.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.113
I also heard
from Alfredo.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.650
And?

06:03.690 --> 06:04.884
His recuperation

06:04.930 --> 06:06.557
is going well--
he says he'll be back

06:06.600 --> 06:08.124
from his sister's next week.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.594
And he doesn't seem to hold
the Oscar business against me,

06:10.630 --> 06:11.562
which I think's quite sporting.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.489
I also
narrowed down

06:14.540 --> 06:16.428
the number of prisons
I might be sent to

06:16.470 --> 06:19.132
if the DA convicts me
of felonious assault.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.536
Each one of them,
I'm happy to report,

06:21.580 --> 06:23.548
has a recovery program,

06:23.580 --> 06:24.979
so I shan't want for meetings.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.571
Oscar Rankin kidnapped Alfredo,

06:28.620 --> 06:30.679
and he tortured you.
Mm, not physically.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.859
It doesn't matter-:
you're not gomg to prison.

06:32.890 --> 06:35.609
A week ago, you'd have said
I'd never relapse.

06:36.890 --> 06:38.687
No, I wouldn't.

06:41.530 --> 06:43.669
I'm due for another meeting.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.793
*

06:52.480 --> 06:53.902
Mr. Holmes.

06:56.140 --> 06:57.846
Mr. Bloom.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.575
I know approaching

06:59.620 --> 07:02.441
someone like you on his way
into a meeting is...

07:02.490 --> 07:03.582
bad form, but...

07:03.620 --> 07:07.613
hey, so is beating up on a man
with his arm in a sling,

07:07.660 --> 07:08.684
wouldn't you say?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.187
How'd you find me?

07:10.230 --> 07:12.528
Lawyers. Lots of 'em.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.028
I have a virtual army
on retainer.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.664
But you already
knew that.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.019
Well, you've successfully
disappeared three women

07:18.070 --> 07:19.958
since 2010,
including your own wife,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.833
so if I were you, I'd have
an army of lavwers, too.

07:22.870 --> 07:26.579
You kicked up a lot of dust
for me last week,

07:26.610 --> 07:28.703
finding that girl who overdosed,

07:28.740 --> 07:32.005
telling the police
the drugs came from me.

07:32.050 --> 07:34.143
I'm the tabloids'
darling again.

07:34.180 --> 07:35.647
The talk

07:35.680 --> 07:37.147
of every news station.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.057
DA's just itchin'
to charge me with something.

07:40.090 --> 07:42.888
But you know how that feels,
am I right?

07:42.930 --> 07:45.023
Yeah. Uh, what do you want?

07:45.060 --> 07:46.652
To hire you.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.793
I hear you're
quite the detective.

07:48.830 --> 07:52.061
Unfortunately,
I've got a "no sadist" policy.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.397
You're right.

07:53.440 --> 07:57.069
I can be connected to the
three women who went missmg.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.534
My wife Alicia
in 2010,

08:00.580 --> 08:03.276
and then two girls I...

08:03.310 --> 08:05.778
partied with...

08:05.810 --> 08:08.813
one in 2012,
another a year later.

08:08.850 --> 08:11.944
They all disappeared,
just like you said.

08:11.990 --> 08:14.959
Yeah. I am quite familiar
with your crimes, Mr. Bloom.

08:14.990 --> 08:16.981
I killed the two girls.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.798
I didn't mean to, of course.

08:22.830 --> 08:26.061
They just couldn't take
the rough stuff.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.988
Addicts.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.702
I buried the bodies

08:30.740 --> 08:33.538
at a property my father
once owned in New Rochelle--

08:33.580 --> 08:36.549
2434 Owen Place.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.639
Why are you telling me?

08:38.680 --> 08:40.978
Because I didn't kill my wife.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.944
Either someone else did,
or...

08:43.990 --> 08:46.584
she left me that night
and never looked back.

08:46.620 --> 08:50.021
Whatever the case, it hurt me,
the things people said.

08:50.060 --> 08:52.085
I was good to Alicia.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.859
She had nothing.
She came from nothing.

08:53.900 --> 08:56.619
I gave her the world.
I deserved better.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.558
I want people

08:58.600 --> 09:01.137
to know the truth.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.834
Do you mean to compel me
to work for you?

09:05.870 --> 09:08.304
No. This isn't for you.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.718
(gunshot echoes)

09:14.220 --> 09:17.644
*

09:50.750 --> 09:52.752
Then he looked at me
like he didn't have

09:52.790 --> 09:54.212
a care in the world,
and then...

09:54.260 --> 09:56.751
put a gun under his chin.

09:56.790 --> 09:57.984
Is that it?

09:59.260 --> 10:01.694
Did he say
anything else?

10:02.730 --> 10:04.960
No.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.968
Sorry you had to see that.

10:08.140 --> 10:10.233
It's hard to put much stock
in anything

10:10.270 --> 10:11.908
a guy like Jonathan
Bloom had to say,

10:11.940 --> 10:14.875
but obviously, we'll talk
to the New Rochelle PD,

10:14.910 --> 10:18.209
get someone out to that property
he told you about.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.111
You doing okay?

10:25.150 --> 10:27.755
Is the captain here?

10:29.020 --> 10:31.284
Captain.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.423
Sherlock.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.655
(sighs):
I was, uh...

10:35.700 --> 10:39.124
waiting for you to finish up
with Marcus. Come in.

10:41.400 --> 10:43.300
Have a seat.

10:45.970 --> 10:48.973
Heard you stopped
by the brownstone earlier on.

10:49.010 --> 10:51.308
That's, uh, very kind.
Ah.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.875
Well, you were
on my mind.
Yeah.

10:53.920 --> 10:57.310
Of course I was.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.045
Several days ago,
I nearly killed a man,

10:59.090 --> 11:01.684
and I injected myself
with a controlled substance.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.756
Me.

11:03.790 --> 11:07.021
Your consultant.

11:07.060 --> 11:08.925
Sherlock...

11:08.960 --> 11:11.463
My behavior was inexcusable,
and,uh".

11:11.500 --> 11:14.389
I do apologize.
You're acting

11:14.440 --> 11:16.806
like you did something.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.434
Something was done to you.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.268
No, I chose to use heroin.

11:22.310 --> 11:25.302
That was my choice.

11:26.410 --> 11:29.447
Anyway, I'm far from ruined.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.484
I recovered myself once before,
and I'll do so again.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.988
But if there

11:36.020 --> 11:38.056
is some difficult news
that you've been putting off

11:38.090 --> 11:40.422
telling me,
th-there's really no need.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.997
Well, I know, aanay.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.969
_Th_at whether or not
the district attorney charges me

11:51.010 --> 11:52.807
with a crime,

11:52.840 --> 11:55.968
my consultancy with the NYPD
has come to an end.

11:59.010 --> 12:02.946
Just tell me I didn't drag
Watson down with me.

12:02.990 --> 12:05.049
I can't.

12:05.090 --> 12:08.059
Captain...
It's done.

12:08.090 --> 12:11.059
The Chief of Detectives
is from the old school.

12:11.090 --> 12:14.059
He never liked the idea
of consultants.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.988
What happened,

12:16.030 --> 12:18.999
it just made it easier for him
to cut ties.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.999
Everything you've
been through this week,

12:22.040 --> 12:24.235
everything
you're going through,

12:24.270 --> 12:26.067
I-I...

12:29.080 --> 12:31.207
I was just waiting
for the right time to tell you.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.810
To tell both
of you.

12:33.850 --> 12:37.240
You know
how much she has to contribute.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.952
When I left for London,
she thrived here.

12:39.990 --> 12:42.208
It's out of my hands.

12:43.860 --> 12:45.851
I'm sorry.

12:48.260 --> 12:51.525
(various overlapping voices
from various broadcasts)

12:51.570 --> 12:54.130
(overlapping voices
continue in distance)

13:04.510 --> 13:05.977
MALE REPORTER: ...the location
was a body with a...

13:06.010 --> 13:08.843
ANCHORWOMAN:
...early this morning, as police
recovered two female bodies

13:08.880 --> 13:11.314
from the backyard
of his suburban home.

13:11.350 --> 13:13.489
Authorities remain tight-lipped
about the identity

13:13.520 --> 13:16.819
of the two women, but we've
learned both are considered

13:16.860 --> 13:18.350
victims of Jonathan Bloom...

13:18.390 --> 13:21.518
He was telling
the truth.
What?

13:21.560 --> 13:23.027
ANCHORWOMAN: ...his wife,
Alicia Garcia-Bloom...

13:23.070 --> 13:24.025
(mutes overlapping broadcasts)

13:24.070 --> 13:25.321
Bloom. The bodies
of the two women

13:25.370 --> 13:27.167
were exactly where he said
they would be.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.191
The police have yet to confirm
their identities, but I assume

13:29.240 --> 13:31.037
that's only
a matter of time.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.833
Is this what I think it is?

13:32.880 --> 13:35.075
If you think it is
my personal collection

13:35.110 --> 13:37.203
of materials relating
to the disappearance

13:37.250 --> 13:39.844
of Bloom's wife,
Alicia Garcia-Bloom,

13:39.880 --> 13:42.371
in 2010, then... yep.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.082
No. I mean are you
seriously doing what he asked?

13:45.120 --> 13:47.179
Are you trying
to clear his name?

13:47.220 --> 13:50.348
If by "you," you mean "we,"
then, yeah.

13:50.390 --> 13:53.325
Two bodies. Right where
he said they'd be.

13:53.360 --> 13:57.490
Jonathan Bloom was a narcissist
and a pathological liar.

13:57.530 --> 13:59.498
Maybe he only told you where
to find them because he wanted

13:59.530 --> 14:01.930
people to do what you're doing
right now: question

14:01.970 --> 14:04.063
his involvement in the one
murder he cared about, AliCia's.

14:04.110 --> 14:07.307
There was never any physical
evidence connecting him
to her disappearance.

14:07.340 --> 14:09.308
Everyone knew their
marriage was on the rocks.

14:09.340 --> 14:11.604
He was cheating on her.
She found out.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.345
Mmm. That doesn't make him
a killer.

14:13.380 --> 14:16.144
He couldn't account for one
of his guns, a .22-caliber.

14:16.180 --> 14:18.978
And, less than a week
before Alicia went missing,

14:19.020 --> 14:20.453
he used his home computer
to search

14:20.490 --> 14:22.048
for ways to dispose of a body.

14:22.090 --> 14:24.183
He insisted that wasn't him.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.084
If memory serves,
he also insisted he didn't kill

14:26.130 --> 14:29.327
two heroin addicts that he lured
into his apartment, right up

14:29.360 --> 14:32.090
until last night.
A complicated man, to be sure.

14:32.130 --> 14:35.293
Uh, I'm confused.
Do you want him to be innocent?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.438
What is that?

14:38.470 --> 14:39.664
It's an article
on the disappearance

14:39.710 --> 14:42.201
of a woman named
Maribel Fonseca.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.468
She went missing
from a motel in Sussex,

14:43.510 --> 14:45.649
New Jersey, the same week
Alicia vanished.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.274
Bloom left an impression on me
last night.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.617
Not to mention some gray matter.

14:49.650 --> 14:52.289
And so, in addition
to revisiting my files,

14:52.320 --> 14:54.481
I considered the possibility
that Alicia fell prey,

14:54.520 --> 14:57.080
not to someone who knew her,
but to a criminal

14:57.130 --> 14:59.382
with an appetite
more serial in nature.

14:59.430 --> 15:02.194
Like Alicia,
Maribel was originally

15:02.230 --> 15:04.095
from Honduras.
She's attractive.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.098
She's in her early 30's.

15:06.130 --> 15:09.531
Well, I could see how they
might've been someone's type.

15:09.570 --> 15:12.130
You know, we didn't even talk
about what you saw last night.

15:12.170 --> 15:13.535
I called you from the station.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.070
Well, we haven't talked.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.270
A bad man let his brains out

15:16.310 --> 15:17.447
for some fresh air.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.277
What else is there to discuss?

15:19.310 --> 15:21.244
WATSON: (sighs)
Did you see the captain?

15:21.280 --> 15:23.180
Just missed each other,
apparently.

15:23.220 --> 15:26.485
You and I both know that,
depending on the DA's mood,

15:26.520 --> 15:28.408
this may well be
my last investigation

15:28.460 --> 15:29.654
for quite some time.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.988
So what do you say?

15:32.030 --> 15:34.328
Hmm? For old times' sake?

15:34.360 --> 15:36.191
MAN:
Whatever happened

15:36.230 --> 15:38.960
to Ms. Fonseca, there's no way
of telling when it happened.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.161
Not exactly.
What do you mean?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.202
She checked in
on a Monday.

15:43.240 --> 15:44.969
Said that she would check out
on Thursday.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.979
Only Thursday came and she was
a no-show at the front desk.

15:48.010 --> 15:50.171
So I went to her room.
I saw that she had left

15:50.210 --> 15:52.599
her stuff there.
I figured she changed her mind,

15:52.650 --> 15:54.675
so I left her a message
on her room phone,

15:54.720 --> 15:57.689
said it was fine, just let me
know the new departure date.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.689
Couple days go by.
No sign of her.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.052
That's when I called
the cops.

16:03.090 --> 16:06.127
According to the newspaper
article, no signs of foul play.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.219
No. Just her stuff.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.228
The cops poked around
a little.

16:10.270 --> 16:13.137
Told me to hold on to her bags,
in case she came back.

16:13.170 --> 16:14.967
That was five years ago.

16:17.470 --> 16:20.268
So, any idea what she
was doing in Sussex?

16:20.310 --> 16:22.198
When I called the police
a few weeks later,

16:22.240 --> 16:24.049
they said she was up
from Florida.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.446
Said she had no family,
worked as a housekeep.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.689
That's all I know, 'cause
that's all they ever found out.

16:30.720 --> 16:33.280
(phone ringing)

16:35.290 --> 16:36.518
Hello?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.425
(over phone):
Ms. Watson, this is Mr. Cook.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.223
I work with Mr. Holmes.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.251
I'm sorry, do you mean
my Mr. Holmes or...

16:42.300 --> 16:46.259
The Mr. Ho_lmes. I understand
you left qUIte a few messages

16:46.300 --> 16:48.598
for him at the New York office
yesterday.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.234
His son and I were expecting
him. He never showed up.

16:51.270 --> 16:53.079
I'm afraid something came up.

16:53.110 --> 16:54.475
But you will be pleased to know

16:54.510 --> 16:56.808
you may be seeing him
as early as next week.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.808
What-what do you mean
we may be seeing him?

16:58.850 --> 17:01.410
I mean the chances
are very good. Cheers.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.338
(hangs up)
Wait a second. I...
(groans)

17:05.420 --> 17:06.387
Who was that?

17:06.420 --> 17:07.648
No one.

17:07.690 --> 17:10.523
So, four changes

17:10.560 --> 17:12.448
of clothing for what she told
the motel manager

17:12.490 --> 17:14.651
was a four-day trip,
some credit card receipts,

17:14.700 --> 17:16.656
and a few
family photos.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.498
I'm beginning to understand
why the Sussex PD didn't take

17:19.530 --> 17:21.691
any of these
things with them.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.065
Look, I get why
you'd want there to be

17:26.110 --> 17:27.338
a connection
between this woman

17:27.380 --> 17:29.109
and Alicia
Garcia-Bloom.

17:29.140 --> 17:30.402
It's a distraction
from everything

17:30.450 --> 17:32.077
that's going on with the DA.

17:32.110 --> 17:34.374
If I wanted
a distraction, Watson,

17:34.420 --> 17:36.638
I'd pay another visit
to Athena and Minerva,

17:36.680 --> 17:39.444
and thrust myself into work
more aerobic than crime scene

17:39.490 --> 17:41.549
reconstruction.
I'm just saying.

17:41.590 --> 17:43.558
I don't want there to be
a connection

17:43.590 --> 17:46.479
between Alicia and Maribel.
I have one.

17:46.530 --> 17:48.851
Puberty is still running

17:48.900 --> 17:50.390
its transformative
course,

17:50.430 --> 17:52.091
but surely you can see that this

17:52.130 --> 17:54.360
is a young Maribel Fonseca.
I'd put her age

17:54.400 --> 17:56.095
at about 15.

17:56.140 --> 17:58.404
This other girl,

17:58.440 --> 17:59.429
it's Alicia.

17:59.470 --> 18:01.438
They knew each other.

18:13.490 --> 18:15.458
Mr. Cook.

18:15.490 --> 18:17.754
I'm Joan Watson.
You called me yesterday.

18:17.790 --> 18:20.759
How did you know where I lived?
I'm here

18:20.800 --> 18:22.290
because I want you to give
a message to Mr. Holmes.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.560
He has a secretary.
Several of them, actually.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.862
You're the one who called me.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.300
Very well.
What's your message?

18:31.340 --> 18:34.309
He can come and visit his son
or he can stay away.

18:34.340 --> 18:37.343
What he can't do is threaten
to come and then never show.
Mr. Holmes

18:37.380 --> 18:39.245
is an extremely busy man.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.716
I'm busy, too. So is Sherlock.
Tell him.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.514
Can a heroin addict be busy?

18:45.550 --> 18:47.552
I'm just curious.

18:47.590 --> 18:51.185
I imagine procuring the drug
might take some effort,

18:51.230 --> 18:53.152
but, after
that, it's a...

18:53.200 --> 18:57.762
simple matter of aim and shoot,
is it not?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.265
What's the hardest
you've ever been hit?

19:02.300 --> 19:03.858
Excuse me?

19:03.910 --> 19:05.639
It's a simple question.

19:06.670 --> 19:08.331
Talk to Mr. Holmes.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.348
Tell him what I said.

19:10.380 --> 19:13.213
I'd hate to have to come back.

19:20.390 --> 19:23.450
(speaking Spanish)

19:23.490 --> 19:25.924
WOMAN: Gracias.
HOLMES: De nada. Adios.

19:25.960 --> 19:26.756
(video call blips off)

19:26.790 --> 19:29.520
Who was that?
Alicia Garcia's aunt.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.358
She still resides
in the same city that Alicia

19:32.400 --> 19:35.961
and Maribel grew up in--
San Pedro Sula, Honduras.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.639
She was just telling me
the tragic circumstances

19:38.670 --> 19:40.831
by which the two women came
to know each other.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.677
In 1995, when both

19:42.710 --> 19:45.508
were just 15, their families
and several others

19:45.550 --> 19:48.678
paid a coyote to bring them
out of Central America,

19:48.720 --> 19:51.314
through Mexico,
and across the American border.

19:51.350 --> 19:54.956
Several days into their journey,
however, they were stopped

19:54.990 --> 19:57.823
by members of the Mexican
Escarra Cartel.

19:57.860 --> 20:00.988
It seems the coyote had pocketed
the tribute he normally paid

20:01.030 --> 20:02.657
to traverse Escarra territory

20:02.700 --> 20:04.964
and was trying
to sneak the caravan through.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.833
The Escarra soldiers escorted
the group into a ditch.

20:07.870 --> 20:10.839
Realizing they were about to be
slaughtered, Alicia and Maribel

20:10.870 --> 20:13.737
and several others made a break
for a wooded area.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.577
The Escarra s_oldiers
opened fire.

20:15.610 --> 20:17.271
When all was said and done,

20:17.310 --> 20:19.346
Alicia and Maribel were
the only survwors.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.268
Several days later,

20:21.320 --> 20:25.518
they escorted the Mexican
authorities back to the site.

20:25.550 --> 20:28.713
All that was left was
a smoldering pile of corpses.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.684
Obviously,
they did eventually

20:31.730 --> 20:33.994
make it to America-- _
the former through her marriage

20:34.030 --> 20:37.568
to Jonathan Bloom, the latter
via green card lottery.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.864
But according to Alicia's aunt,
they only stayed in touch

20:39.900 --> 20:42.368
for a short while
after the massacre.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.369
As they grew older,
they went their separate ways.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.573
15 years later,
they both disappeared.

20:50.040 --> 20:52.600
Do you think someone
from the Escarra Cartel

20:52.650 --> 20:53.947
caught up with them?

20:53.980 --> 20:55.345
If the cartel wanted them dead,

20:55.380 --> 20:56.847
it would've happened
a long time ago.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.518
And as that image attests,

20:58.550 --> 21:00.689
cartels are in the habit
of making statements

21:00.720 --> 21:01.914
with their killings.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.951
If an Escarra
did murder Alicia

21:03.990 --> 21:05.981
and Maribel, it seems unlikely
he would've disposed

21:06.030 --> 21:08.851
of their bodies,
rather than put them on display.

21:08.900 --> 21:11.323
(phone chimes)

21:12.570 --> 21:14.868
I have to go.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.061
An old friend has agreed
to procure Maribel's cell phone

21:17.100 --> 21:18.806
and credit card information

21:18.840 --> 21:20.603
from the weeks
before she disappeared.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.005
I'm hoping
it will provide a clue

21:22.040 --> 21:23.644
as to why she went
to New Jersey.

21:23.680 --> 21:25.477
What do you mean, an old friend?

21:25.510 --> 21:28.377
Why don't you just call
Marcus or the captain?

21:28.420 --> 21:32.618
I'd like you to pay a visit
to a Honduran restaurant

21:32.650 --> 21:34.709
in New Jersey, by the name
of Novena Vida.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.320
Why?

21:37.360 --> 21:39.328
There was a receipt
in Maribel's belongings.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.022
It indicates she ate there the
week before she disappeared.

21:42.060 --> 21:45.359
So, you're hoping
that she talked to someone.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.890
Her or Alicia.

21:46.930 --> 21:49.398
According to my files,
she dined there

21:49.440 --> 21:51.465
the day before Maribel
left Florida.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.434
Hard to imagine
that's just a coincidence.

22:07.460 --> 22:09.587
You're late.

22:09.620 --> 22:12.726
I think what you mean
to say is "Thank you."

22:12.760 --> 22:15.399
Thank you, Mr. McNally,

22:15.430 --> 22:17.796
for violating the privacy
of an American citizen.

22:19.030 --> 22:20.793
A nice beard.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.467
Yeah, I'd tell
you what it's for,

22:22.500 --> 22:24.434
but then I'd
have to kill you.

22:24.470 --> 22:27.576
That makes us even
for London, by the way.

22:27.610 --> 22:29.430
By London, you mean
the moment I realized

22:29.480 --> 22:31.107
a member
of your agency was about

22:31.150 --> 22:33.414
to break into the offices
of a British newspaper.

22:33.450 --> 22:34.917
You called me,
let me fix it.

22:34.950 --> 22:36.110
I appreciate that.

22:36.150 --> 22:38.141
Take care, Holmes.

22:38.190 --> 22:42.012
Agent McNally, I'm sure you're
aware of my recent troubles.

22:43.490 --> 22:45.856
I-I wanted you to know that...

22:45.890 --> 22:48.097
if I don't go to prison,

22:48.130 --> 22:50.769
I will be parting ways
with the department.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.825
Are you hitting me up
for a job?

22:52.870 --> 22:55.464
You know more than most how
effective Watson and I can be.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.764
You're hitting me
up for two jobs.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.165
I'm doing you the favor
of making you aware

23:00.210 --> 23:02.178
of our availability.
Yours would be one

23:02.210 --> 23:04.098
of several agencies
that we would consider

23:04.150 --> 23:05.674
for future consultations.

23:05.710 --> 23:07.575
Aren't you the one
who was just saying

23:07.620 --> 23:10.077
how all the NSA does is
violate other peoples rights?

23:10.120 --> 23:13.556
Some of the investigative work
you do has merit.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.581
Some of it is even important.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.951
(sighs)

23:19.990 --> 23:21.924
Look, you two are good.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.789
You really think
any federal agency

23:26.830 --> 23:29.060
is gonna want to
get near you now?

23:29.100 --> 23:30.704
You nearly killed a guy.

23:30.740 --> 23:33.402
Oh, and by the way,
you're a drug addict.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.534
Hey, maybe...

23:36.580 --> 23:38.775
I mean, maybe somebody'll
throw you some black bag work,

23:38.810 --> 23:40.209
but I wouldn't
hold my breath.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.569
We're not cat burglars.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.588
No, you're liabilities.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.659
On the bright side,

23:47.690 --> 23:50.079
you have time now.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.987
Time to get better.

23:53.030 --> 23:55.225
May be just what
the doctor ordered.

23:55.260 --> 23:58.468
MAN:
Yeah. Sure.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.819
I seen that picture in

23:59.870 --> 24:01.462
the news the last
couple of days.

24:01.500 --> 24:02.831
She was married
to that guy.

24:02.870 --> 24:04.735
The, uh... the one
who killed himself.

24:04.770 --> 24:07.830
But you didn't know her?
No.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.632
Why?

24:09.680 --> 24:12.171
Well, she drove up here
from New York in May, 2010.

24:12.210 --> 24:14.519
She had lunch. I thought
maybe she was a regular.

24:14.550 --> 24:17.178
No. Sorry.

24:18.220 --> 24:21.883
What about this woman,
Maribel Fonseca?

24:21.920 --> 24:24.855
She'd have come a couple
of days after Alicia.

24:24.890 --> 24:26.858
Do you remember her?

24:26.890 --> 24:28.892
Yeah. It's strange.

24:28.930 --> 24:31.524
It's like dj vu or something.

24:31.570 --> 24:34.266
What do you mean?
I do remember her.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.235
She was doing what you're
doing-- showing me pictures.

24:37.270 --> 24:39.033
But hers were of a man.

24:39.070 --> 24:41.538
She wanted to know if
I had seen him here.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.002
She was trying to ﬁnd him.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.907
Did she say why
she wantedN to find him?
0.

24:45.950 --> 24:47.713
She didn't tell you his name?

24:47.750 --> 24:51.709
No, but I remember he was
very tall, very handsome.

24:51.750 --> 24:55.584
Think I said I had seen him
in the bar once or twice.

24:55.620 --> 24:59.556
I just remembered because
it was so strange.

24:59.590 --> 25:02.297
A beautiful woman coming here,

25:02.330 --> 25:05.197
asking me to look at pictures.

25:05.230 --> 25:07.562
Now I wonder if I
should get used to it.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.669
WATSON:
I brought some food
from Novena Vida.

25:14.710 --> 25:16.575
Anything else?

25:16.610 --> 25:18.805
Yes. The owner recognized
Maribel Fonseca.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.977
He said that she came
into the restaurant

25:21.020 --> 25:22.817
in 2010 and showed
him a few pictures

25:22.850 --> 25:25.284
of a Latino man in his 30's,
very tall,

25:25.320 --> 25:27.880
very handsome.
Did she give the man's name?

25:27.920 --> 25:31.128
No. Didn't say what she wanted
with him, either.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.799
The odds
are quite good, Watson,

25:33.830 --> 25:36.526
that she wanted to kill him.

25:37.830 --> 25:39.866
Alicia and Maribel
didn't just know each other.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.562
I believe
they were plotting a murder.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.645
Combine Maribel Fonseca's
credit card and phone records

25:51.680 --> 25:53.307
with Alicia's,
and a certain time line

25:53.350 --> 25:56.046
comes into view.
On May the first,

25:56.080 --> 25:58.947
Maribel receives a phone call
from Alicia in Florida.

25:58.990 --> 26:01.709
Very next day, she's on a plane
bound for Newark.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.682
So they weren't as out of touch

26:03.730 --> 26:06.119
as Alicia's aunt thought
they were.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.253
On May the third, Maribel goes
to the Honduran Restaurant,

26:08.300 --> 26:11.098
Novena Vida in New Jersey.
Day after that,

26:11.130 --> 26:14.099
she goes to a hardware store,
purchases the following items.

26:14.140 --> 26:17.029
A tarp, two pairs
of rubber gloves, two shovels,

26:17.070 --> 26:18.606
and several gallons

26:18.640 --> 26:20.130
of industrial-strength
drain cleaner

26:20.170 --> 26:22.104
consisting chiefly of lye.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.199
It's a good shopping list if
you're planning to kill someone.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.071
All of this less than one week
after Alicia goes

26:27.110 --> 26:28.611
to the same restaurant,

26:28.650 --> 26:30.709
and someone
in the Bloom household

26:30.750 --> 26:33.878
searches the phrase,
"Ways to dispose of a body."

26:33.920 --> 26:36.115
The police thought
that was Jonathan Bloom.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.957
You're saying it was Alicia.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.220
If I'm right, she's also
the most likely reason

26:40.260 --> 26:41.921
his .22 was never discovered.

26:41.960 --> 26:44.224
It was her contribution
to the murder plot.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.727
Whoever she and Maribel
were looking for--

26:46.770 --> 26:48.135
I submit they found him.

26:48.170 --> 26:50.058
Only something went wrong.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.660
He got the upper hand,
killed them,

26:52.710 --> 26:54.007
and then got rid
of their bodies.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.234
It would fit the evidence.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.134
Perhaps if the media
had not seized

26:57.180 --> 26:59.648
so immediately
and so viciously on Bloom

26:59.680 --> 27:01.238
_ as_ the architect
of his Wife's disappearance,

27:01.280 --> 27:02.941
the connection
would have been made

27:02.980 --> 27:04.208
between the women much sooner.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.718
Yeah. Gee, poor guy.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.810
I mourn not for him,
but for the missed opportunity.

27:09.860 --> 27:12.852
This case may never have grown
so cold.

27:12.890 --> 27:14.323
So, does any of this tell us

27:14.360 --> 27:16.225
who Alicia and Maribel
were looking to kill?

27:16.260 --> 27:17.989
No.

27:18.030 --> 27:19.327
But the owner
of Novena Vida said

27:19.370 --> 27:20.997
they were looking
for a Latino man.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.291
The two women were bound

27:22.340 --> 27:23.864
by their family slaughter

27:23.910 --> 27:25.832
at the hands
of the Escarra cartel.

27:25.870 --> 27:29.033
Yesterday, you posited that an
Escarra came looking for them.

27:29.080 --> 27:32.743
Perhaps they went looking
for an Escarra.

27:32.780 --> 27:35.112
(lock buzzes)

27:39.220 --> 27:42.087
Stop it.
Stop what?

27:42.120 --> 27:46.329
Imagining me on a line like
that, coming to see you.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.024
Truthfully, I'd rather you not
visit me in prison.
Why?

27:51.070 --> 27:53.368
I hate for you to see me
in a place like this.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.197
You're not going to prison.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.196
If you like,
we can write letters.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.798
Not writing you letters.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.775
I'll have other correspondence--
C, Moriarty.

28:01.810 --> 28:04.244
That's still
g0ing on?

28:04.280 --> 28:06.339
Sherlock Holmes,
Joan Watson.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.847
You can see him now.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.379
I did it.

28:15.420 --> 28:16.978
Did what?

28:17.020 --> 28:18.351
(scoffs)

28:18.390 --> 28:21.052
Whatever we came here
to talk about.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.159
You got me.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.168
You may recall

28:25.200 --> 28:27.225
incarcerated members
of drug cartels

28:27.270 --> 28:28.294
often confess to crimes

28:28.340 --> 28:30.490
committed by
their compatriots.

28:30.540 --> 28:32.360
They receive a level of
protection on the inside;

28:32.410 --> 28:34.970
their families, a level
of support on the outside.

28:35.010 --> 28:37.877
Unfortunately, we're not here
to accuse you of anything.

28:37.910 --> 28:39.844
WATSON:
20 years ago,

28:39.880 --> 28:41.347
four Escarra soldiers massacred

28:41.380 --> 28:43.018
a group of Honduran immigrants.

28:43.050 --> 28:44.347
The only survivors

28:44.390 --> 28:45.743
were two young women,

28:45.790 --> 28:47.815
Alicia Garcia
and Maribel Fonseca.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.179
HOLMES:
In 2010,

28:49.220 --> 28:50.756
we believe Alicia
and Maribel

28:50.790 --> 28:52.382
came across one of
the men responSIble

28:52.430 --> 28:53.488
and they planned
to kill him.

28:53.530 --> 28:56.351
Before your arrest in 2012,

28:56.400 --> 28:57.867
you were a well-connected,

28:57.900 --> 28:59.367
New York-based
Escarra lieutenant.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.834
So we were hoping
that you might be able

29:01.870 --> 29:04.361
to help us identify the man
that they were after.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.469
WATSON:
He was tall.
Six feet, good-looking.

29:06.510 --> 29:10.401
He would have been in his
mid- to late 30's in 2010.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.249
And he may have been a regular

29:12.280 --> 29:14.441
at a restaurant in New Jersey
called Novena Vida.

29:14.480 --> 29:18.439
You're talking about Benicio.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.310
Alto, guapo...

29:20.350 --> 29:23.251
Had to be him.

29:23.290 --> 29:25.326
Does Benicio have
a last name?

29:25.360 --> 29:27.419
Del Toro.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.849
Benicio del Toro is an actor.

29:32.300 --> 29:33.938
HOLMES:
You should know, Zuniga,

29:33.970 --> 29:36.336
that Miss Watson
and I did our homework

29:36.370 --> 29:38.361
prior to this visit.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.002
We know that your wife

29:40.040 --> 29:41.576
and 19-year-old son
reside in Juarez.

29:41.610 --> 29:43.874
After I leave
here today,

29:43.910 --> 29:47.448
I'm going to wire them $100,000.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.209
(chuckles)

29:49.250 --> 29:50.569
You can't bribe me, man.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.315
You misunderstand.

29:52.350 --> 29:53.339
I'm not offering a bribe.

29:53.390 --> 29:55.051
I'm issuing a threat.

29:55.090 --> 29:57.012
The cartel has been
true to its word.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.119
Your family has been
taken care of.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.582
I understand your son
is even being groomed

30:00.630 --> 30:02.825
for a management position.

30:02.860 --> 30:05.988
What would happen if they
suddenly receive $100,000,

30:06.030 --> 30:07.463
along with the hearty thanks

30:07.500 --> 30:10.230
of a known associate
of the NYPD? Hmm?

30:11.370 --> 30:13.167
Are they as loyal to
the Escarras as you?

30:13.210 --> 30:15.178
Would they report
that windfall?

30:15.210 --> 30:17.132
How might the cartel react?
Would they look to silence you?

30:17.180 --> 30:18.477
Your family?
Your family's family?

30:18.510 --> 30:21.013
We all know how thorough
the Escarras can be.

30:24.050 --> 30:26.018
We should leave.

30:26.050 --> 30:27.915
Banks close in an hour.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.552
I know the names

30:29.590 --> 30:31.478
of the four men who did this.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.021
That's all they are now.
Names.

30:37.060 --> 30:39.199
Explain.

30:40.470 --> 30:42.859
(sighs)

30:42.900 --> 30:45.368
After the massacres,

30:45.410 --> 30:47.628
la polica waged war on us.

30:47.670 --> 30:50.434
We lost many of our soldiers,

30:50.480 --> 30:53.244
including the men
that you're asking about.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.875
So none of them were
in New Jersey in 2010.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.139
They were in the ground
in Mexico.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.381
I sold you short, didn't I?

31:04.430 --> 31:07.285
I'm going to wire your family
$200,000.

31:07.330 --> 31:10.128
You're wrong that the two girls
were the only ones who survived.

31:12.170 --> 31:15.162
The coyote, he survived, too.

31:15.200 --> 31:16.997
Maybe he's the one
that they saw.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.439
WATSON:
You're telling us

31:18.470 --> 31:20.108
the cartel killed everyone

31:20.140 --> 31:21.505
except for the man
who ripped them off?

31:21.540 --> 31:26.045
Eh... a good coyote,
an earner...

31:26.080 --> 31:28.048
he's hard to find.

31:28.080 --> 31:30.412
Immigrants?

31:30.450 --> 31:32.509
They never run out.

31:32.550 --> 31:35.314
Give me his name.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.510
All I ever heard was a nickname.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.027
"El Gato."

31:45.370 --> 31:48.168
Assuming we can take
Mr. Zuniga at his word,

31:48.200 --> 31:50.168
we'll have our work
cut out for us.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.998
We need to find the
name of El Gato,

31:53.040 --> 31:57.409
a coyote who was active in
San Pedro Sula in the mid-'905

31:57.440 --> 31:59.977
and in the tri-state
area in 2010.

32:00.010 --> 32:01.978
He certainly makes
sense as a suspect.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.612
If he hadn't kept
the Escarras' money,

32:03.650 --> 32:05.413
none of those people
would have died.

32:05.450 --> 32:07.179
May as well have put
a gun to their heads.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.716
Our only hope is that
the man is as stupid

32:10.760 --> 32:12.523
as his street
handle, "The Cat."

32:12.560 --> 32:14.528
If he is, he might not be
too difficult to identify.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.324
Hmm. You don't happen to know
anyone in law enforcement

32:17.360 --> 32:19.169
in San Pedro Sula, do you?
(cell phone rings)

32:19.200 --> 32:21.668
I don't, but you know me-- I
make friends expeditiously.

32:23.340 --> 32:24.307
Hmm.

32:24.340 --> 32:26.137
Hello.

32:26.170 --> 32:28.172
Yeah.

32:30.010 --> 32:32.001
Yes, indeed.

32:33.650 --> 32:35.242
That was my barrister.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.475
Just heard from the
district attorney.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.648
Seems you will not have to
visit me in prison after all.

32:40.690 --> 32:43.056
You're not being charged.

32:45.290 --> 32:47.258
Okay, I'm gonna heat up
some celebratory leftovers.

32:47.290 --> 32:49.258
And then we're gonna
talk about all the women

32:49.300 --> 32:50.528
that you don't have
to write to.

32:54.540 --> 32:55.962
(feet descending stairs)

33:01.580 --> 33:03.536
Okay, there's something
that you should know.

33:03.580 --> 33:08.040
I lied the other night when I
said I hadn't seen the captain.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.048
We talked.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.048
And I was made
aware of the fact

33:12.090 --> 33:13.614
that because_ of
my transgressmns,

33:13.650 --> 33:16.050
neither one of us
will be permitted

33:16.090 --> 33:17.489
to consult for _
the department again.

33:22.430 --> 33:24.421
We-We've been sacked.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.098
Yeah, um, I, uh...

33:32.140 --> 33:33.767
Sorry, Watson.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.675
It's okay.

33:39.710 --> 33:42.713
Kind of had a feeling.

33:42.750 --> 33:45.639
I mean,
we're not cops.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.659
What we do and what they do,
it's different.

33:48.690 --> 33:50.658
So we don't have
the same restrictions,

33:50.690 --> 33:53.124
so we don't have
the same protections.

33:57.330 --> 33:59.127
Well, I have a plan.

33:59.170 --> 34:02.560
Um, involves
another confession.

34:02.600 --> 34:06.468
My reasons for investigating
the disappearance

34:06.510 --> 34:09.331
of Alicia Garcia-Bloom were
not entirely selfless.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.575
The mystery of
her disappearance

34:11.610 --> 34:13.407
has been one of the greatest
of the last 20 years,

34:13.450 --> 34:15.247
or so the popular media
would have us believe.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.078
Jonathan Bloom's face has been
on the cover of every magazme,

34:18.120 --> 34:19.644
he's been the subject
of books, documentaries...

34:19.690 --> 34:21.658
Uh, if you think
solving this case

34:21.690 --> 34:23.510
is gonna get us back into the
department's good graces...

34:23.560 --> 34:24.527
Not us, Watson.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.528
You.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.553
My fate is sealed.

34:29.600 --> 34:30.794
As is appropriate.

34:30.830 --> 34:32.388
But you?

34:32.430 --> 34:34.239
No, I think there's
still a chance.

34:34.270 --> 34:37.865
So whe we discover what
happened to AliCia and Maribel,

34:37.900 --> 34:39.231
you'll take the credit.

34:39.270 --> 34:40.635
Sherlock...

34:40.670 --> 34:42.228
Glory will be bestowed upon you,

34:42.280 --> 34:44.669
and the NYPD, I predict,
will want to say

34:44.710 --> 34:46.507
that they played some
small part,

34:46.550 --> 34:49.348
so you will acknowledge them
to whatever degree is required,

34:49.380 --> 34:51.746
and then they will forget
that they dismissed you.

34:51.790 --> 34:53.348
What about you?

34:53.390 --> 34:56.188
As I said, my fate is sealed.

34:56.220 --> 34:59.280
But that's not what I meant.

34:59.330 --> 35:01.423
Say "Operation: Bestow Glory"
actually works.

35:01.460 --> 35:03.428
What are you gonna do
while I consult with the police?

35:03.460 --> 35:06.293
You know I have my distractions.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.292
You really don't get it.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.205
I don't get what?

35:11.240 --> 35:14.209
When it comes to what we do,

35:14.240 --> 35:17.835
the only thing that matters
to me is our partnership,

35:17.880 --> 35:20.508
so you go, I go.

35:20.550 --> 35:22.609
You offered me a job.

35:22.650 --> 35:24.447
I didn't take it
to work with the police.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.412
I took it to work with you.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.912
Well, you should know
that my detractors

35:29.960 --> 35:32.520
are not limited
to the NYPD.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.654
My professional prospects
are quite bleak in general.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.850
We'll figure it out.

35:39.430 --> 35:41.489
We always do.

35:49.610 --> 35:51.407
Yeah, you're
right, it is ours.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.849
Thanks for
putting it aside.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.849
Just out of curiosity,
how did a dead squirrel

35:55.880 --> 35:57.677
play into the work
you were doing here?

35:57.720 --> 35:59.688
It didn't.

35:59.720 --> 36:01.688
Well, not exactly.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.517
It's kind of
a long story.

36:03.560 --> 36:06.620
Well, ifI find any more
of your stuff lying around,

36:06.660 --> 36:08.457
I'll call you.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.491
Thanks.

36:13.730 --> 36:16.528
You know I think the brass
is making a mistake, right?

36:16.570 --> 36:18.629
I mean, if there was someone
I thought I could talk to...

36:18.670 --> 36:19.807
It's okay.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.398
Really.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.237
And this isn't good-bye.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.941
It's not like we're not
gonna see each other

36:24.980 --> 36:26.675
just because we're not
working together.

36:26.710 --> 36:28.644
Who knows? Maybe Sherlock
and I will throw a party.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.773
(scoffing): Yeah, sure,
that sounds like him.

36:30.820 --> 36:32.617
(chuckles)

36:32.650 --> 36:34.618
You guys talked about
what you're gonna do next?

36:34.660 --> 36:36.651
We're reaching out
to people.

36:36.690 --> 36:37.850
We're letting them know
we're available.

36:37.890 --> 36:39.926
(elevator bell chimes twice)

36:42.660 --> 36:44.628
Something will turn up.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.764
Things won't be
the same around here.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.431
(Sherlock speaking Spanish)

36:56.310 --> 36:57.277
Adios.

36:57.310 --> 36:58.902
(sighs)

36:58.950 --> 37:01.271
That was a homicide detective
in the city of San Pedro Sula.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.719
Most unpleasant fellow.

37:02.750 --> 37:06.618
What happened to "making
friends expeditiously"?

37:06.650 --> 37:08.652
I was attempting
to clear up a discrepancy

37:08.690 --> 37:11.659
between our information
regarding El Gato and his.

37:11.690 --> 37:13.658
Man took it
as a personal affront.

37:13.690 --> 37:14.896
He purports to
be a detective

37:14.930 --> 37:16.727
but peddles his
questionable skills

37:16.760 --> 37:19.320
in a city with the highest
murder rate in the world.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.759
San Pedro Sula averages
nine murders a day,

37:21.800 --> 37:24.268
97% of which go unsolved.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.266
And I'm sure you didn't
mention that to him.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.937
Might have come up.

37:27.970 --> 37:29.301
I've been looking
for that.

37:32.710 --> 37:35.349
So you said that his facts
and ours don't match up?

37:35.380 --> 37:36.779
He confirmed that a coyote
known as El Gato

37:36.820 --> 37:38.378
operated out of his city

37:38.420 --> 37:41.651
at the time of the E_scarra
massacre in MeXIco.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.715
But while the Polica
Nacional were never able

37:43.760 --> 37:45.728
to uncover his real_
name or apprehend him,

37:45.760 --> 37:47.557
they claim that several
clients described him

37:47.590 --> 37:49.797
quite consistently in 1995.

37:49.830 --> 37:53.493
Average height, jowly,
receding hairline.

37:53.530 --> 37:56.499
Well, the owner at Novena Vida
said that Maribel was looking

37:56.540 --> 37:58.804
for a tall, handsome man
in his 30's.

37:58.840 --> 38:01.001
If the Hondurans are
to be believed,

38:01.040 --> 38:04.009
El Gato would currently
be in his 50's.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.702
So we would be wrong
about Alicia and Maribel

38:06.750 --> 38:09.913
finding and attempting
to kill him five years ago.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.488
You know what "Novena Vida"
translates to?

38:19.530 --> 38:21.327
You've heard me co_nduct
several conversations

38:21.360 --> 38:22.327
entirely in Spanish.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.952
"The ninth life."

38:24.000 --> 38:27.993
As in "nine lives," as in
the number a cat would have.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.733
I don't understand. Why...

38:34.780 --> 38:36.907
Wait, this is
my favorite bit. There.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.048
This video went viral
in April 2010.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.412
Someone tried to rob you,
and you fought back.

38:44.450 --> 38:45.917
You beat the _man
into submissmn.

38:45.950 --> 38:46.712
One of your employees

38:46.750 --> 38:48.752
posted the security
footage online.

38:48.790 --> 38:50.348
My cook.

38:50.390 --> 38:53.359
He was proud, kept
calling me Rocky.

38:53.390 --> 38:56.621
I didn't like it, but it brought
us a little extra business.

38:56.660 --> 38:58.924
Well, we think it gained some
negative attention as well.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.619
Alicia Garcia-Bloom
saw that video,

39:00.670 --> 39:02.365
and she recognized you
as El Gato--

39:02.400 --> 39:04.709
the coyote hired
by her parents

39:04.740 --> 39:06.765
in San Pedro Sula in 1995.

39:06.810 --> 39:08.675
The one who cost
them their lives.

39:08.710 --> 39:10.132
What?

39:10.180 --> 39:11.841
That's why she came
here in 2010,

39:11.880 --> 39:13.472
to see if it was really you.

39:17.550 --> 39:19.518
You say I'm from San Pedro Sula?

39:19.550 --> 39:22.155
You're right-- 15 years ago.

39:22.190 --> 39:24.158
But I told you-- I'd never
even heard of that woman

39:24.190 --> 39:25.521
until she was in the news.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.881
But you do remember
Maribel Fonseca.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.989
You said
you two talked.

39:30.030 --> 39:31.827
She showed you
pictures of a man.

39:31.870 --> 39:34.896
Another fiction--
she never said a word.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.999
And she certainly never
showed you any photographs.

39:37.040 --> 39:40.999
More likely, she came here
to size up her prey.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.598
The other day, you told me
Maribel was looking

39:42.640 --> 39:43.971
for a tall, handsome man.

39:44.010 --> 39:45.807
But that was just
to keep us

39:45.850 --> 39:47.408
from taking
a closer look at you.

39:47.450 --> 39:49.816
If you were attempting to
describe your exact opposite,

39:49.850 --> 39:51.613
well done--
you have the face and frame

39:51.650 --> 39:53.117
of a distressed catcher's mitt.

39:53.150 --> 39:56.654
WATSON: Maribel and Alicia would
not have come after you here.

39:56.690 --> 39:59.921
They knew about the security
cameras from the video.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.951
More likely, they pounced
at your home.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.491
You gained the upper hand,
as you are wont to do.

40:04.530 --> 40:07.124
Suddenly, you had
two bodies to get rid of.

40:07.170 --> 40:10.059
But your victims brought their
own shovels, tarps and lye.

40:10.100 --> 40:13.069
You could have buried them
right there in your yard.

40:13.110 --> 40:14.907
Tell us, Mr. Murillo,

40:14.940 --> 40:16.908
when the New Jersey police
search your home,

40:16.940 --> 40:19.079
will they find two graves?

40:19.110 --> 40:21.670
Say they do.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.574
It was self-defense,
you said it yourself.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.986
I did, I did.

40:26.020 --> 40:28.215
You may have killed those women,
you may have been complicit

40:28.250 --> 40:31.219
in the deaths of their entire
families, but none of that

40:31.260 --> 40:33.820
will guarantee a conviction
in an American court.

40:33.860 --> 40:36.226
Emphasis on "American."

40:36.260 --> 40:38.797
But did you know that
the US. and Honduras have

40:38.830 --> 40:41.697
a mutual extradition treaty that
dates back over a hundred years?

40:41.740 --> 40:42.695
HOLMES:
Mm-hmm.

40:42.740 --> 40:44.708
This is a warrant
for your arrest

40:44.740 --> 40:46.708
for the murder of a competing
coyote and his wife

40:46.740 --> 40:48.935
in San Pedro Sula,
in 1999.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.949
You thought you were
an Internet sensation before.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.948
Give it a few hours.

41:00.190 --> 41:03.079
WATSON: So what do you
think of New Jersey?

41:03.120 --> 41:05.156
Just made some new friends.

41:05.190 --> 41:08.990
We told them they could
leave our names out of it.

41:09.030 --> 41:11.999
Are you suggesting we become
commuting consulting detectives?

41:12.030 --> 41:14.897
Well, it's a big state,
plenty of crime.

41:14.940 --> 41:16.089
Could do worse.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.869
Well, if travel's
not an issue,

41:17.900 --> 41:19.265
San Pedro Sula could
benefit from our presence.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.504
You're kidding, right?
(cell phone chimes)

41:23.610 --> 41:27.569
You said you had some errands
to run this afternoon, correct?

41:27.610 --> 41:29.009
I have one of my own.

41:34.250 --> 41:36.252
*

41:56.940 --> 41:58.908
I'd forgotten
about the view here.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.099
It's really quite something.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.742
Is that what you wanted?

42:01.780 --> 42:02.940
To discuss the slqline?

42:02.980 --> 42:05.642
I let myself in.
I hope you don't mind.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.840
It's your property, Father,
you can do as you please.

42:13.760 --> 42:14.954
You don't look well.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.560
You look as spry as ever.

42:17.600 --> 42:20.023
My compliments to the virgins
whose blood you bathe in.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.197
I see the opiates
haven't dulled your wit.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.333
Nor has old age
withered yours.

42:24.370 --> 42:27.168
I didn't come here
to exchange barbs.

42:27.210 --> 42:30.008
Why did you come here?

42:30.040 --> 42:32.099
Why do we ever
meet like this?

42:32.150 --> 42:35.039
You've made a
mess, Sherlock.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.342
I'm here to fix it.

42:36.380 --> 42:39.884
* Drop what I'm doing,
and sit beside you... *

42:39.920 --> 42:41.911
