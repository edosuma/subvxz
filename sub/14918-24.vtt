WEBVTT

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
(pills clattering)

00:15.040 --> 00:18.000
(telephone rings,
footsteps approach)

00:18.000 --> 00:19.200
(Kitty) MWAH. OKAY, BABY.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.100
(ring)
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE, EVAN.
DON'T...

00:22.100 --> 00:24.010
(ringing)
IT'S YOUR MOM.

00:24.010 --> 00:26.020
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

00:26.020 --> 00:28.020
OKAY. NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

00:28.020 --> 00:30.050
THIS IS MOMMY'S PHONE.
HI, MOM. WHAT'S WRONG?

00:30.050 --> 00:32.040
WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME
SO EARLY IN THE MORNING?

00:32.040 --> 00:34.200
Look, when you're in your 60s,
you don't sleep,

00:34.200 --> 00:36.160
EVER. REMEMBER THAT.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.010
MM.
No, it's your sister.
I'm worried--

00:39.010 --> 00:41.010
DO YOU THINK THERE'S
ANY CHANCE THAT YOU COULD

00:41.010 --> 00:43.180
STOP BY OVER THERE
AND CHECK ON HER TODAY?
I'm so sorry, Mom,

00:43.180 --> 00:45.070
BUT I CAN'T.
I'M CAMPAIGNING ALL WEEKEND.

00:45.070 --> 00:48.090
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE ANY TIME.
AND--AND, ROBERT, ARE YOU NOT--

00:48.090 --> 00:52.010
ARE YOU NOT PACKED? WE HAVE TO
CATCH THE BUS IN, LIKE, AN HOUR.
I HAVE TO TAKE A RAIN CHECK.

00:52.010 --> 00:55.040
SOMETHING CAME UP WITH
THE APPROPRIATIONS BILL.
AND YOU'RE JUST TELLING ME
ABOUT THIS NOW?

00:55.040 --> 00:58.160
I woke up to a stream
of panicked e-mails.
I WAS REALLY

00:58.160 --> 01:00.160
LOOKING FORWARD TO SPENDING
SOME TIME WITH YOU.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.020
Oh, maybe I should
go with you.
WHERE?

01:03.020 --> 01:06.070
CAMPAIGNING. I'VE NEVER BEEN.
Mom, do you think
I really need to bring

01:06.070 --> 01:08.160
MY RABIDLY DEMOCRATIC MOTHER
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH ME?

01:08.160 --> 01:10.180
I'M AHEAD IN THE POLLS
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

01:10.180 --> 01:13.170
I WOULD LIKE
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
YOU SHOULD TAKE HER.
YOU HAVE 16 STOPS.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.220
YOU NEED SOMEBODY
TO PLAY CARDS WITH.
I PLAY CARDS.

01:15.220 --> 01:18.180
WHERE ARE WE GOING?
NO, <i>I'M.</i> I'M GOING TO
A FUND-RAISER IN SACRAMENTO,

01:18.180 --> 01:20.220
AND THEN I'M GOING TO
AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN OXNARD,

01:20.220 --> 01:22.220
AND THEN I'M GOING
TO A FIREHOUSE IN--

01:22.220 --> 01:25.130
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT IS.
MWAH. I LOVE YOU.

01:25.130 --> 01:27.130
FIREMEN?
KITTY, I LOVE FIREMEN.

01:27.130 --> 01:31.040
AH! MWAH.
I LOVE YOU. HERE.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.030
HOW'S THIS TIE, GOOD?
IT'S--IT'S GREAT.

01:33.030 --> 01:35.100
UM, HONEY, DON'T FORGET
ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT.

01:35.100 --> 01:38.130
SAUL AND SCOTTY ARE DOING THEIR
RESTAURANT MENU UP IN OJAI.
YEAH, I'LL BE THERE.

01:38.130 --> 01:41.050
KNOCK 'EM DEAD.
ALL RIGHT.

01:41.050 --> 01:43.110
SO... ARE WE ON?
ON? ON WHAT?

01:45.180 --> 01:48.030
<i>(man) WHY ARE YOU SO NERVOUS?</i>
<i>(woman) I JUST--I JUST...</i>

01:48.030 --> 01:49.190
WOW.

01:49.190 --> 01:51.190
I MEAN, MOM SAID
YOU WERE DEPRESSED,

01:51.190 --> 01:53.140
BUT EATING PIZZA
IN THE MORNING?

01:53.140 --> 01:55.220
WHAT, ARE YOU IN COLLEGE?
TASTES GOOD COLD.

01:55.220 --> 01:58.110
TASTES GOOD COLD! (growls)
OH! GET OFF ME.

01:58.110 --> 02:01.170
HEY, JUSTIN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
UH, WELL, I HEARD DORM GIRL
WAS DOWN IN THE DUMPS,

02:01.170 --> 02:04.030
SO I CAME BY TO CHEER HER UP.
WELL, I'M SORRY
I'M NOT MORE UPBEAT.

02:04.030 --> 02:06.030
UNEMPLOYMENT DOESN'T REALLY
SUIT ME.

02:06.030 --> 02:08.120
UH, WELL, YOU'RE TALKING TO
THE KING OF UNEMPLOYMENT,

02:08.120 --> 02:10.030
AND DON'T WALLOW.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.110
SO CLEAN THE CLOSET,
WRITE A RéS--

02:12.110 --> 02:15.010
HAVE YOU EVEN STARTED LOOKING
FOR A JOB YET?
NO ONE'S HIRING,
AND EVEN IF THEY WERE HIRING,

02:15.010 --> 02:17.010
THEY'RE CERTAINLY NOT
HIRING ANYBODY THAT DROVE

02:17.010 --> 02:19.180
THEIR FAMILY BUSINESS
INTO THE GROUND.
(groans)

02:19.180 --> 02:21.130
JUSTIN, SHE'S BEEN ON THE COUCH
FOR THREE DAYS NOW.

02:21.130 --> 02:23.100
SHE WANTS TO BE ALONE.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.100
BUT I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU ALONE.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.110
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU ALONE.
MM.

02:27.110 --> 02:30.000
ALL RIGHT? SO PLEASE STOP EATING
THIS LEFTOVER PIZZA.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.120
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.

02:31.120 --> 02:34.080
YOU WANT TO EAT SOMETHING?
I'LL MAKE YOU AN OMELET. WHOA.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.050
JUST ONE MORE PIECE.
SARAH.

02:36.050 --> 02:38.140
(Luc sighs)

02:38.140 --> 02:40.230
I LOST EVERYTHING,
JUSTIN.

02:40.230 --> 02:42.130
NOT EVERYTHING.

02:42.130 --> 02:44.200
I MEAN, YOU STILL HAVE
NARROW LAKE.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.200
THAT WORTHLESS
PIECE OF PROPERTY?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.200
HOW TRAGIC IS IT
THAT MOM, HOLLY AND I

02:48.200 --> 02:52.040
END UP JOINT OWNERS
OF THAT DAMN PLACE?
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY TRAGIC.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.140
IT'S LIKE THE BOOBY PRIZE.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.140
ALL RIGHT. NO MORE PIZZA.
UGH!

02:55.140 --> 02:57.090
YOU'RE DONE.
(whispers) OH, GOD.

02:57.090 --> 03:00.070
IT'S GROSSING ME OUT.
(normal voice) AT LEAST
REBECCA GOT A JOB OFFER.

03:00.070 --> 03:02.200
YEAH, SHE DID. SO, SO MUCH
FOR GOING TO HAITI.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.160
HAITI?
UH, WELL, MY COLLEGE
IS OFFERING A PROGRAM...

03:05.160 --> 03:08.040
(telephone ringing)
WHERE WE GO DOWN TO HAITI
AND HELP OUT FOR A YEAR.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.040
AND I'D ACTUALLY GET
FULL CREDIT.
WOW. A YEAR?

03:10.040 --> 03:12.170
(Luc) HELLO.
THAT'S KIND OF A LONG TIME
TO BE APART, DON'T YOU THINK?

03:12.170 --> 03:14.170
(Luc speaking indistinctly)
YEAH. BUT SHE DIDN'T
TAKE THE JOB YET,

03:14.170 --> 03:17.060
SO I WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO
CONVINCE HER TO COME WITH ME.
OH.

03:17.060 --> 03:19.200
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GONNA BE
IN A LIBRARY THE WHOLE TIME.

03:19.200 --> 03:23.060
I MEAN, I'M DOWN THERE
HELPING OUT PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?
HEY, MORE GOOD NEWS. AHEM.
YOUR MOM IS COMING OVER.

03:23.060 --> 03:25.140
UGH!
(clicks on tv)

03:25.140 --> 03:27.050
<i>(Olivia Newton-John's</i>
<i>"Physical" playing)</i>

03:27.050 --> 03:30.060
(inhales) OH, SAUL--
SAUL, THESE PEACHES--

03:30.060 --> 03:33.020
YOU CAN'T GET ANYTHING
LIKE THAT IN L.A.

03:33.020 --> 03:36.020
WOW. ARE YOU SURE WE'RE GONNA
BE READY IN A MONTH?

03:36.020 --> 03:38.160
WELL, WE MAY NOT BE FIRING
ON ALL FOUR BURNERS,

03:38.160 --> 03:41.020
BUT WE'LL BE SERVING FOOD.
OH! I FOUND

03:41.020 --> 03:43.150
A REALLY GREAT DAY CARE CENTER
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

03:43.150 --> 03:46.020
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE THE BABY
WITH US IN THE RESTAURANT?

03:46.020 --> 03:48.020
WELL, SOMETIMES,
BUT NOT ALWAYS.

03:48.020 --> 03:50.200
A BABY!
A BABY!

03:50.200 --> 03:53.100
(groans)
OH, DID WE WAKE YOU?
MWAH.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.010
WHAT, WITH ALL THE BANGING,
THE CLANGING,

03:56.010 --> 03:58.150
THE OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN PLAYING?
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

03:58.150 --> 04:00.180
I'M SO GLAD WE RENTED
THE OLD OJAI HOUSE

04:00.180 --> 04:02.220
FOR SOME PEACE AND QUIET
THIS WEEKEND.

04:02.220 --> 04:04.220
WELL, WE'RE NOT HERE
FOR PEACE AND QUIET.

04:04.220 --> 04:06.070
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY'S COMING
TOMORROW.

04:06.070 --> 04:08.230
MM-HMM. MM.
YOU MADE A MENU.
YEP, IT'S A TEST MENU.

04:08.230 --> 04:12.020
WE WANT EVERYONE'S OPINION
ON HOW EVERYTHING TASTES.

04:12.020 --> 04:14.160
OH, SO IT'S AN ORAL EXAM?
WAIT TILL YOU SEE
THE AMAZING RECIPES

04:14.160 --> 04:16.210
WE'RE GONNA MAKE.
I FEEL BLOATED ALREADY.

04:16.210 --> 04:19.120
OKAY, KEVIN, IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HELP, OUT OF THE KITCHEN.

04:19.120 --> 04:23.090
INSIDE VOICE, PLEASE.
I NEVER KNEW THAT MY NEPHEW WAS
SUCH A GRUMP IN THE MORNING.

04:23.090 --> 04:26.050
I NEVER KNEW MY UNCLE WORE
A MUUMUU, SO WE'RE EVEN.

04:26.050 --> 04:28.030
IT'S NOT A MUUMUU.
IT'S A NIGHTSHIRT.
(cell phone ringing)

04:28.030 --> 04:31.190
(blows air) WHERE--
DO YOU KNOW WHERE MY--

04:31.190 --> 04:33.070
(rings)
YEAH.

04:33.070 --> 04:36.070
(rings and beeps)
HEY, KIT.
SAUL'S WEARING A MUUMUU.

04:36.070 --> 04:39.030
SAYS THE MAN
IN THE SLEEPING MASK.
HOW'S MY SENATOR-TO-BE?

04:39.030 --> 04:41.080
OH, CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.190
WHAT, ABOUT THE PRIMARY?
No, about me and Mom
on a bus.

04:43.190 --> 04:45.190
I-I SOMEHOW GOT SUCKERED
INTO LETTING HER

04:45.190 --> 04:48.050
CAMPAIGN WITH ME ALL WEEKEND.
I'LL TAKE THAT FOR YOU.

04:48.050 --> 04:50.140
I MEAN, I-IT COULD BE FUN,
RIGHT?
I'm sor--Mom,

04:50.140 --> 04:53.120
THE MOST VOCAL BLEEDING-HEART
LIBERAL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA?

04:53.120 --> 04:55.120
NO. THAT'S NOT FUN.
THAT'S CAMPAIGN SUICIDE.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.050
OH, I WAS SO HOPING
YOU WEREN'T GONNA SAY THAT.
WHOO-HOO! KITTY!

04:58.050 --> 05:01.080
SHE BROUGHT SARAH.
SARAH'S NOT EXACTLY
THE PERSON

05:01.080 --> 05:04.190
I'D WANT CHEERING
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
NO, SHE LOOKS LIKE
SOMEBODY KILLED HER CAT.

05:04.190 --> 05:07.130
OH, I-I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW, OKAY?
(beeps)

05:07.130 --> 05:10.140
SURPRISE. YOU'VE GOT
THE BOTH OF US.
(chuckles) YEAH.
HEY. HI, SARAH.

05:10.140 --> 05:13.160
HI. DOES THIS THING
HAVE A TV?
UH... YEAH.

05:13.160 --> 05:16.000
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU THINKING?

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
SHE WAS DOING NOTHING
BUT EATING PIZZA

05:18.000 --> 05:21.050
AND WATCHING SOAP OPERAS.
MOM, THIS IS NOT
A BUS TO VEGAS, OKAY?

05:21.050 --> 05:23.150
WELL, I--
I HAVE SOME
SERIOUS CAMPAIGNING TO DO.

05:23.150 --> 05:25.150
WHERE'S THE REMOTE?
UM, CH--

05:25.150 --> 05:27.190
OH, NEVER MIND. GOT IT.

05:27.190 --> 05:30.150
YOU SEE? SHE'S BETTER ALREADY.
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

05:30.150 --> 05:33.030
COME ON, HONEY.

05:33.030 --> 05:35.190
LOOK AT THIS. I JUST GOT
ANOTHER FRIEND REQUEST.

05:35.190 --> 05:38.020
SAUL JUST DISCOVERED
Facebook.

05:38.020 --> 05:39.130
OOH. HOT. OLD FLAME?

05:39.130 --> 05:42.040
WELL, WE HAD A LITTLE MOMENT,
BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

05:42.040 --> 05:45.210
OH, LOOK. HE'S A BIG
A.I.D.S. ACTIVIST.

05:45.210 --> 05:48.130
IT SAYS HE'S BEEN LIVING WITH
A.I.D.S. FOR THE LAST 22 YEARS.

05:48.130 --> 05:50.210
OH, HE DOES THOSE BIKE-A-THONS
AND EVERYTHING.

05:50.210 --> 05:53.190
THAT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE.
I DID A BIKE-A-THON.

05:53.190 --> 05:56.150
I RAISED 1,500 BUCKS, AND THEN
I HAD TO SPEND 1,500 BUCKS

05:56.150 --> 05:59.020
ON MY OWN CHIROPRACTOR.
OH, THAT REMINDS ME. YOU HAVE
YOUR PHYSICAL NEXT WEEK.

05:59.020 --> 06:01.040
OH, YEAH.
DO YOU TWO STILL GET TESTED?

06:01.040 --> 06:04.140
MM-HMM.
FOR H.I.V.? YEAH, OF COURSE.
IT'S SORT OF LIKE HABIT NOW.

06:04.140 --> 06:08.120
YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE SPRING CLEANING.
YEAH, AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE
THIS ONE'S BEEN TRAMPING AROUND.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.110
<i>EXACTLY.</i>
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"EXACTLY"?

06:11.110 --> 06:14.020
(chopping)
WHAT ABOUT YOU, SAUL?

06:14.020 --> 06:16.030
WHAT, ME, TESTED?

06:16.030 --> 06:18.230
(laughs) OH, WHAT--WHAT FOR?
I'M 100 YEARS OLD.

06:18.230 --> 06:22.050
ANYWAY, I HAVEN'T HAD SEX SINCE
THE "HINDENBURG" EXPLODED.

06:22.050 --> 06:25.010
NO, THE ONLY THING ABOUT ME
THAT GETS TESTED IS MY PATIENCE.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.160
NOW COME ON.

06:26.160 --> 06:31.110
WE HAVE RECIPES TO COOK.
WE HAVE MEALS TO MAKE.

06:31.110 --> 06:34.110
LISTEN, WE HAVE ENOUGH
TO HANG THIS GUY.

06:34.110 --> 06:36.160
STANTON'S BEEN BUYING VOTES

06:36.160 --> 06:39.070
TO WIN HIGHLY INFLATED
DEFENSE CONTRACTS.

06:39.070 --> 06:42.190
HE IS GETTING RICH
ON THE BACKS OF OUR SOLDIERS.
YOU THINK
THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT?

06:42.190 --> 06:44.130
THEN WHY
HANG ON TO THE TAPES?

06:44.130 --> 06:47.070
YOU HAVE HIM OFFERING YOU
MONEY, A JOB--
HE THREATENED KITTY.

06:47.070 --> 06:49.070
THE ONE THING
I TOLD YOU WAS,

06:49.070 --> 06:52.120
I WOULDN'T LET THIS
COMPROMISE HER CAMPAIGN.
HE HASN'T ANYTHING ON KITTY.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.050
THEN HE'LL MAKE SOMETHING UP.
I'M ALREADY HEARING THIS CRAP

06:55.050 --> 06:58.030
ABOUT KITTY USING MY PLANE
TO CAMPAIGN AROUND THE STATE.

06:58.030 --> 07:00.190
I MEAN, WHO DO YOU THINK
THAT IS? IT'S STANTON.

07:00.190 --> 07:04.000
LOOK, IT IS JUST NOISE.
IT'S THE KIND OF NOISE THAT
DROWNS EVERYTHING ELSE OUT.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
AND IT STARTS WITH
THE LITTLE LIES AND...

07:06.000 --> 07:08.130
(glass clatters)
THEN IT'S THE BIG LIES,
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

07:08.130 --> 07:11.170
SHE'S DESTROYED.
IF YOU DON'T GO PUBLIC,
HE'S GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER--

07:11.170 --> 07:13.200
LITERALLY. HE IS
OUT THERE ON HIS OWN

07:13.200 --> 07:15.200
OPERATING WITHOUT
ANY ACCOUNTABILITY,

07:15.200 --> 07:17.100
AND AMERICAN SOLDIERS
ARE DYING

07:17.100 --> 07:19.110
BECAUSE ALL HE CARES ABOUT
IS MAKING MONEY.

07:19.110 --> 07:21.110
OKAY, LOOK, I TOLD YOU
I'D GO AFTER THIS GUY,

07:21.110 --> 07:23.030
AND I'VE DONE MY PART.

07:23.030 --> 07:26.030
BUT I ALSO TOLD YOU, IF IT GOT
ANYWHERE NEAR HER, I WAS OUT.

07:26.030 --> 07:28.030
HE KNOWS
THAT WE'RE ON TO HIM NOW.

07:28.030 --> 07:30.020
HE'S GONNA BE IN CHURCH
EVERY SUNDAY

07:30.020 --> 07:33.040
SINGING IN THE CHOIR.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.040
THOSE TAPES ARE
OUR ONLY SHOT.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.010
NOW PLEASE...
GIVE THEM TO ME.

07:38.010 --> 07:40.230
I CAN'T.
(sighs)

07:40.230 --> 07:43.230
I HAVE TO DO THIS IN A WAY
THAT PROTECTS MY WIFE.

07:43.230 --> 07:47.200
I HOPE YOU HAVE
A SAFE PLACE TO HIDE THEM.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.150
TAPES WILL BE SAFE.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.040
HONEY, YOU KNOW, I THINK
YOU'RE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.040
WELL, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MOM.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THIS STOP,

08:06.040 --> 08:08.060
MAYBE YOU SHOULD START OUT
WITH IMMIGRATION REFORM

08:08.060 --> 08:10.030
INSTEAD OF TAX CUTS.

08:10.030 --> 08:12.200
LAST THREE STOPS, IT'S JUST BEEN
TAX CUTS, TAX CUTS, TAX CUTS.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.030
THAT'S BECAUSE TAX CUTS WORK.
THEY STIMULATE THE ECONOMY--

08:16.030 --> 08:20.020
OH, MY GOD! THEY FOUND ANOTHER
FERAL CHILD IN WISCONSIN.

08:20.020 --> 08:21.210
<i>(tv playing indistinctly)</i>
OH, WAIT.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.210
NEVER MIND.
THIS WAS A REALLY BAD IDEA.

08:24.210 --> 08:26.210
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE,
HONESTLY.
MNH-MNH. MNH-MNH.

08:26.210 --> 08:28.210
AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER
ALL OF THE OPTIONS,

08:28.210 --> 08:31.060
I THINK WATCHING SOAP OPERAS
AND READING TRASHY MAGAZINES

08:31.060 --> 08:33.210
IS A PRETTY HARMLESS WAY
OF SELF-MEDICATING.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.220
I'M NOT SELF-MEDICATING, MOM.
I AM GRIEVING.

08:35.220 --> 08:37.160
THERE ARE STAGES.

08:37.160 --> 08:39.210
YES, I KNOW, HONEY.
THERE ARE FIVE STAGES.

08:39.210 --> 08:42.080
UH, EXCUSE ME. CAN I HAVE
THIS FOR A MINUTE?
NO!

08:42.080 --> 08:45.070
MY FAVORITE SHOW'S
ABOUT TO COME ON.
KITTY, THE GOVERNOR'S
GONNA BE ON.

08:45.070 --> 08:47.030
THIS IS ALL I'M LIVING FOR.

08:47.030 --> 08:49.200
DON'T LET THEM TAKE IT
AWAY FROM ME, KITTY.
SARAH.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.200
<i>SARAH.</i>
(sighs deeply)

08:51.200 --> 08:53.190
IS SHE GONNA BE LIKE THIS
THE WHOLE TIME?

08:53.190 --> 08:56.010
NO, NO.
YOU HAVE TO--
YOU HAVE TO FIX THIS.

08:56.010 --> 08:58.060
GIRLS. OKAY, GIRLS. STOP.
JUST--
FINE.

08:58.060 --> 09:00.080
SARAH, SARAH,
LISTEN TO ME.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.080
HONEY, COME ON NOW.
COME ON NOW.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.110
WE'RE--WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
SOME FUN.

09:04.110 --> 09:08.030
FUN? I AM STUCK ON A BUS
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE

09:08.030 --> 09:10.180
LISTENING TO MY SISTER'S
CHEERING, ADORING FANS.

09:10.180 --> 09:13.010
NOT THAT I-I'M NOT HAPPY
FOR YOU.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.210
I MEAN, I WANT HER TO WIN.
HONESTLY, I DO.

09:15.210 --> 09:17.210
BUT I TANKED
MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS.
OH.

09:17.210 --> 09:20.060
I BET THE HOUSE ON NARROW LAKE.
I CAME UP DRY.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.150
LET'S FACE IT.
MY INSTINCTS SUCK.

09:22.150 --> 09:25.150
SWEETHEART,
YOUR INSTINCTS DON'T SUCK.

09:25.150 --> 09:27.140
WELL, THEY DO, A LITTLE.
OH.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.050
<i>(tv playing indistinctly)</i>

09:29.050 --> 09:30.140
SARAH, HONEY,
LISTEN TO ME.

09:30.140 --> 09:32.200
YOU CANNOT BEAR THE WEIGHT

09:32.200 --> 09:35.040
OF OJAI GOING OUT OF BUSINESS
ALL BY YOURSELF.

09:35.040 --> 09:38.110
I'M JUST AS RESPONSIBLE
AS YOU ARE.
DOES ANYONE KNOW
IF I GET CARSICK?

09:38.110 --> 09:41.030
WELL, WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT
I THINK.

09:41.030 --> 09:43.230
<i>(tv playing indistinctly)</i>

09:43.230 --> 09:46.030
HERE.
SHE CAN HAVE THIS BACK.

09:46.030 --> 09:48.000
<i>(man) ...ACCOUNTS FOR 12%</i>
<i>OF THE ENTIRE U.S...</i>

09:52.020 --> 09:54.030
UM...
WHAT?

09:54.030 --> 09:56.110
IT'S SAUL.
OH, HE CAN'T HEAR US.

09:56.110 --> 09:59.190
THE WALLS ARE, LIKE, OAK.
NO, IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT THAT.

09:59.190 --> 10:02.010
HE SHOULD GET TESTED, KEVIN.
OH, THAT.

10:02.010 --> 10:05.030
LOOK, HE HASN'T HAD SEX SINCE
THE STONE AGE, THAT POOR MAN.

10:05.030 --> 10:06.130
HE SAID SO HIMSELF.

10:06.130 --> 10:08.200
(Saul) I HEARD THAT!
SAUL?

10:08.200 --> 10:11.060
YES.
ARE YOU HOLDING
A GLASS TO THE WALL?

10:11.060 --> 10:13.130
NO, BUT I HAVE
MY NEW HEARING AIDS IN.

10:13.130 --> 10:16.110
OKAY, IT IS VERY SWEET
FOR YOU BOTH TO CARE,

10:16.110 --> 10:18.220
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT,
BUT THIS IS NOT A POSSIBILITY.

10:18.220 --> 10:21.220
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE TESTED?
WOULD YOU PLEASE
STOP WORRYING ABOUT ME?

10:21.220 --> 10:25.020
LET'S WORRY ABOUT THE RESTAURANT
THIS WEEKEND, OKAY?
YOU KNOW, WHAT IF
WE ALL WENT TOGETHER?

10:25.020 --> 10:27.160
I'M SURE THERE'S A PLACE
IN TOWN WE COULD GO.
(whispers) COME ON.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.160
YEAH, WE COULD GO TOMORROW
OUT OF SAUL-IDARITY.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.140
(normal voice)
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

10:31.140 --> 10:33.160
I'LL GO NEXT MONTH WHEN I HAVE
MY CHOLESTEROL CHECKED.

10:33.160 --> 10:36.010
GREAT. GREAT. I'LL GO
WITH YOU IF YOU WANT.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.070
IT'S OKAY. I'LL BE FINE.
THANK YOU.

10:38.070 --> 10:40.160
OH... DON'T START
FOOLING AROUND.

10:40.160 --> 10:43.110
THE WALLS ARE PAPER THIN.

10:43.110 --> 10:46.060
(door closes)

10:46.060 --> 10:48.220
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING.

10:48.220 --> 10:52.200
UH, SURE. SURE.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.200
I GUESS THE, UH,
OBVIOUS QUESTION IS,

10:54.200 --> 10:57.170
WHAT AM I DOING HERE
AT 11:30 AT NIGHT?

10:57.170 --> 11:00.050
HEY, YOU DIDN'T FINISH
AT THE HOSPITAL TILL NOW.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.200
OKAY, LET ME REPHRASE.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.110
WHAT ARE <i>WE</i> DOING HERE
AT 11:30 AT NIGHT?

11:04.110 --> 11:06.210
I JUST WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

11:06.210 --> 11:08.230
UM, WELL, I-I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG, DID I?

11:08.230 --> 11:10.130
NO, NO, TO THE CONTRARY.

11:10.130 --> 11:15.010
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
THAT I CAN TRUST RIGHT NOW.

11:15.010 --> 11:18.040
LOOK, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT. YOU'RE A SOLDIER.

11:18.040 --> 11:21.010
THAT'S WHAT I NEED
RIGHT NOW.

11:21.010 --> 11:24.080
I WANT YOU
TO HOLD ON TO THAT.
WHAT IS THIS?

11:24.080 --> 11:26.110
IT'S A KEY
TO A SAFE DEPOSIT BOX.

11:26.110 --> 11:28.130
THIS IS THE ADDRESS
TO THE BANK.

11:28.130 --> 11:30.140
NOW THIS IS
IN BOTH OF OUR NAMES,

11:30.140 --> 11:33.050
AND YOU AND I ARE THE ONLY ONES
WHO KNOW ABOUT IT.

11:33.050 --> 11:35.140
(chuckles)
Y-YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?
THERE'S AN ENVELOPE INSIDE.

11:35.140 --> 11:38.000
AND WHEN I FIGURE OUT
WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH IT,

11:38.000 --> 11:39.150
I'LL LET YOU KNOW,

11:39.150 --> 11:42.080
BUT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME,
I WANT YOU TO GIVE IT TO KITTY,

11:42.080 --> 11:45.080
AND SHE'LL MAKE THE DECISION
ON WHAT TO DO.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO YOU?

11:45.080 --> 11:47.180
IS THIS ABOUT YOUR HEALTH OR--
JUSTIN,
DO THIS FOR ME, PLEASE.

11:47.180 --> 11:50.040
OKAY?
YEAH.

11:50.040 --> 11:51.070
YEAH.

11:54.060 --> 11:58.000
THERE.
THAT'S A LITTLE MORE FESTIVE.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.150
NOW I'M GONNA TURN
THIS LIGHT RIGHT HERE...

12:02.150 --> 12:05.010
MOM, MOM, WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:05.010 --> 12:08.060
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING NOW.
WELL, THAT'S THE POINT.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.140
IT AIN'T EXACTLY
THE RITZ AROUND HERE.
THEY BETTER HAVE CABLE.

12:11.140 --> 12:15.050
NO, NO, NO.
NO MORE TV FOR YOU, MISSY.

12:15.050 --> 12:18.050
YOU'RE CUT OFF.
WE'RE DOING FACIALS.
OH, MY GOD.
WE'RE OUT OF WINE.

12:18.050 --> 12:21.060
WHERE'S THE MINI BAR?
(Kitty)
AT THE FOUR SEASONS. TH--

12:21.060 --> 12:23.020
(bed clatters)
(whispers) MOTHER.

12:23.020 --> 12:24.060
(sighs)

12:24.060 --> 12:26.200
(bed clatters)
OH, OH!

12:26.200 --> 12:28.200
JUST GET UP. GET UP.
WHAT? WHAT?

12:28.200 --> 12:32.110
THEY NEVER WASH THOSE
BEDSPREADS. GET UP OFF OF THERE.

12:32.110 --> 12:34.110
YOU'RE LIABLE TO GET
SOME HORRIBLE SKIN DISEASE.

12:34.110 --> 12:37.160
I'D LIKE A SKIN DISEASE.
ANYTHING JUST TO FEEL AGAIN.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.130
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LISTEN UP.

12:40.130 --> 12:43.020
WE'RE GONNA DO FACIALS.
GOT IT.

12:43.020 --> 12:45.170
WAIT A MINUTE.
HAVE YOU GUYS EVER HEARD OF

12:45.170 --> 12:47.170
"CITIZENS FOR
A CORRUPT-FREE AMERICA"?

12:47.170 --> 12:49.160
NO, IT SOUNDS LIKE
SOME HORRIBLE,

12:49.160 --> 12:51.160
RIGHT-WING, MILITANT,
GUN-TOT--

12:51.160 --> 12:53.090
(chuckles)
YEAH, WELL, THEY'RE SAYING

12:53.090 --> 12:55.140
THAT I'M FLYING AROUND
CALIFORNIA IN A PRIVATE JET.

12:55.140 --> 12:58.010
WELL, YOU--YOU DO FLY AROUND
CALIFORNIA IN A PRIVATE JET.

12:58.010 --> 13:00.030
I DON'T CAMPAIGN IN IT,
MOTHER.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.190
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

13:01.190 --> 13:03.180
THEY'RE SAYING
THAT I CAMPAIGN IN IT.

13:03.180 --> 13:07.040
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T USE
TAXPAYERS' DOLLARS TO GAS IT UP.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.170
I MEAN, THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.
WELL, KITTY, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

13:09.170 --> 13:12.040
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA DO
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, MOM.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.100
YOU CAN'T FIGHT THESE WACKOS.
KITTY, THEY'RE LYING
ABOUT YOU.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.100
NO, MOM, LET IT GO.
I MEAN IT. PLEASE.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.070
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
I'M SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP.
WELL, I-I, YOU KNOW--

13:18.070 --> 13:19.190
MOM.
WHAT?

13:19.190 --> 13:22.040
SHE SAID LET IT GO.
I AM LETTING IT GO.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.010
(Sarah and Nora
talking over each other)
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GUYS,
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

13:25.010 --> 13:27.230
I NEED YOU TO BE QUIET.
I'M SORRY.

13:27.230 --> 13:32.050
BUT I REALLY HAVE TO START
WORKING ON MY SPEECH.

13:32.050 --> 13:34.060
OKAY, GIVE ME THE KEYS
TO THE BUS.

13:34.060 --> 13:37.050
I'M GONNA GET MORE LIQUOR.
NO. NO, YOU'RE NOT
DRIVING THE BUS.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.100
OKAY,
I WILL GET A CAB.

13:39.100 --> 13:41.010
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DRIVE ANYTHING.

13:41.010 --> 13:43.010
FOR GOODNESS SAKES.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:43.010 --> 13:46.000
I'M GONNA GO GET ONE OF THOSE
NICE, LITTLE INTERN PEOPLE

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
AND HAVE THEM GO TO THE STORE.
OH, GOOD IDEA.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.050
MAKE SURE HE GETS A SCREW TOP
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AN OPENER.
FOR GOD SAKES.

13:52.050 --> 13:55.050
(door closes)

13:55.050 --> 13:57.070
DON'T YOU DARE.

14:05.050 --> 14:07.050
MM.

14:07.050 --> 14:08.010
MM.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.000
WAIT.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.190
MY FACE FEELS FUNNY.

14:13.190 --> 14:16.050
IT LOOKS FUNNY.

14:16.050 --> 14:19.180
OH. DID I FORGET
TO WASH MY MASK OFF?

14:19.180 --> 14:21.030
UH-HUH. OH, MY GOD, SARAH.

14:21.030 --> 14:23.210
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
SUCH TINY LITTLE PORES ON--

14:23.210 --> 14:25.060
ON THAT SIDE ANYWAY.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.120
OH, GOOD.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.030
WHERE'S MOM?

14:29.030 --> 14:30.120
DON'T KNOW.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.170
OH!

14:31.170 --> 14:32.200
(gasps)

14:32.200 --> 14:34.000
OH.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.160
UH, MY SCIATICA'S
KICKING IN.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.100
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.200
MOM, WHY DID YOU
SLEEP ON THE FLOOR?

14:40.200 --> 14:42.050
I HAVE NO IDEA.

14:42.050 --> 14:44.100
OH! OH!

14:44.100 --> 14:46.100
OH, OH, MY...
(cell phone ringing)

14:46.100 --> 14:48.200
RIGHT SIDE
OF MY BODY IS NUMB.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.050
OH, OH.
(ring)

14:50.050 --> 14:52.050
OH, OH.
(rings and beeps)

14:52.050 --> 14:55.000
HEY, WHAT'S UP?
OH, GOD.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.020
THIS PLACE LOOKS LIKE
A FRAT ROOM.
(Sarah) MOM...

14:58.020 --> 15:00.140
WHAT, YOU'RE KIDDING?
YOU'VE GOT POTATO CHIPS
IN YOUR HAIR.

15:00.140 --> 15:03.040
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.
EW! GET IT OUT! EW.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.060
(beep)

15:04.060 --> 15:07.100
OH, I DIDN'T SLEEP
ONE WINK LAST NIGHT.

15:07.100 --> 15:11.000
WHICH ONE OF YOU TWO GIRLS
HAS A TINY LITTLE BLADDER?

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
THAT WOULD BE
THE MOTHER OF TWO.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.090
EXCUSE ME.

15:14.090 --> 15:17.010
HEY, MOM, DID YOU HAPPEN
TO SIGN ON THE WEB SITE

15:17.010 --> 15:20.130
THAT WAS TRASHING ME
LAST NIGHT?
(inhales deeply)

15:20.130 --> 15:22.210
MAYBE JUST FOR
ONE LITTLE MINUTE.

15:22.210 --> 15:24.160
OH, MY GOD, MOM.

15:24.160 --> 15:27.090
KITTY, I COULDN'T LET THEM
GET AWAY WITH IT.

15:27.090 --> 15:29.090
THEY--THEY WERE LYING
ABOUT YOU.

15:29.090 --> 15:31.170
YOU HAD TOO MUCH WINE.
KITTY, LISTEN...

15:31.170 --> 15:33.170
IT WASN'T
JUST THE JET PLANE.

15:33.170 --> 15:36.080
THE--THEY--THEY STARTED IN
ABOUT YOUR WIG.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.040
THEY SAID YOU SPENT THOUSANDS
AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

15:39.040 --> 15:41.160
AND SINGLE-HANDEDLY
PLUCKED STRANDS OF HAIR

15:41.160 --> 15:44.160
OUT OF POOR LITTLE ORPHAN GIRLS'
HEADS TO MAKE THE WIG.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.070
I HAD TO RESPOND.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.230
OH, MY GOD. YOU TOLD THEM
HOW MUCH MY WIG COST.

15:48.230 --> 15:51.060
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
YOUR WIG COST.

15:51.060 --> 15:53.140
REALLY? BECAUSE IT SAYS
RIGHT HERE. $4,300.

15:53.140 --> 15:56.020
OH, THAT IS ABSURD.
NO, SARAH,
IT'S NOT ABSURD.

15:56.020 --> 15:58.120
THAT'S WHAT IT COST--
EXACTLY WHAT IT COST.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.100
I MEAN, I KNOW
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE,

16:01.100 --> 16:03.090
BUT THEY'RE INCREDIBLY
EXPENSIVE.
(clicking keyboard keys)

16:03.090 --> 16:06.040
WELL, SWEETHEART,
YOU HAD CANCER.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.000
THEY CAN'T BEGRUDGE YOU
ONE LITTLE WIG.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
NO, MOM, YOU'RE WRONG.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
IT'S EITHER
RICH KITTY McCALLISTER--

16:12.000 --> 16:14.130
OUT OF TOUCH,
SPENDING ALL THIS MONEY,

16:14.130 --> 16:17.010
OR IT'S POOR KITTY McCALLISTER--
CANCER SURVIVOR, FRAGILE.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.010
HOW WILL SHE EVER WITHSTAND
A PRIMARY

16:19.010 --> 16:21.020
LET ALONE
A TERM IN THE SENATE?

16:21.020 --> 16:23.020
NO, THIS IS COMING
FROM SOMEONE

16:23.020 --> 16:25.020
WHO KNOWS
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING,

16:25.020 --> 16:28.000
SOMEONE WHO FOUND OUT PRECISELY
HOW MUCH MY WIG COST.
WELL, WHO?

16:28.000 --> 16:30.110
THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

16:30.110 --> 16:33.100
OKAY, SO YOU'RE SAYING
IF SOMEONE IS TAKING AMIODARONE,

16:33.100 --> 16:36.230
THEY COULD BE SUFFERING
FROM VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA?

16:36.230 --> 16:39.170
WOW, THAT'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

16:39.170 --> 16:42.210
UM, NO, NO. I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG HE'S BEEN TAKING IT.

16:42.210 --> 16:45.130
OKAY. UH, WELL,
THANKS A LOT, PROFESSOR.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.130
AND, UH, I WILL, UH,
GET BACK TO YOU.

16:47.130 --> 16:49.060
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

16:49.060 --> 16:51.060
(cell phone beeps)
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

16:51.060 --> 16:54.160
UH, NOTHING.
JUST A-A SCHOOL QUESTION.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.160
SO, JUSTIN,
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

16:56.160 --> 16:59.060
ABOUT THE WHOLE HAITI THING.

16:59.060 --> 17:03.050
AND... WH-WHAT IF WE BOTH DO
WHAT WE WANT TO DO?

17:03.050 --> 17:04.190
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:04.190 --> 17:08.080
YOU GO TO HAITI,
AND... I TAKE THIS JOB.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.140
HOW WOULD THAT WORK?
I MEAN,
I-I KNOW IT WOULD BE--

17:10.140 --> 17:12.140
IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT, BUT--
I MEAN--TIME-OUT.

17:12.140 --> 17:14.130
REBECCA, LIKE,
W-WE JUST GOT MARRIED.

17:14.130 --> 17:16.130
THE WHOLE POINT
IS TO STAY TOGETHER.

17:16.130 --> 17:19.110
(sighs)
I TOOK THE JOB, JUSTIN.

17:19.110 --> 17:21.230
YOU WHAT?
YOU KNEW THE DEADLINE
WAS TODAY.

17:21.230 --> 17:24.020
YEAH, REBECCA, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU WERE JUST GONNA

17:24.020 --> 17:27.010
TAKE THE JOB--
JUSTIN,
I WANT THIS OPPORTUNITY.

17:27.010 --> 17:31.030
THIS IS A HUGE STEP FORWARD
FOR ME.
SO WHAT, I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST
GO TO HAITI WITHOUT YOU?

17:31.030 --> 17:33.100
I'M TRYING TO COMPROMISE.
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT
TRYING TO COMPROMISE.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.060
YOU JUST MADE THE DECISION
FOR US.
NO, I DID NOT--

17:35.060 --> 17:37.060
YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.
I'M NOT GOING.

17:37.060 --> 17:39.130
REBECCA, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.

17:39.130 --> 17:41.130
AT LEAST BE HONEST
ABOUT IT.

17:46.050 --> 17:48.100
SO YOU'RE HERE
FOR AN H.I.V. TEST?

17:48.100 --> 17:51.110
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, WHY?
ARE YOU SURPRISED?

17:51.110 --> 17:54.040
YOU PROBABLY DON'T GET
MANY PEOPLE MY AGE

17:54.040 --> 17:56.030
COMING IN HERE TO--
I WISH WE DID.

17:56.030 --> 17:58.030
THE OVER-50 SET IS OUR
FASTEST GROWING RISK GROUP.

17:58.030 --> 18:00.040
IT'S THOSE
PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING PILLS.

18:00.040 --> 18:01.130
AH. AH, YES.

18:01.130 --> 18:04.040
WELL, THE TRUTH IS, I REALLY
HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING

18:04.040 --> 18:06.040
TO PUT MYSELF AT RISK
FOR YEARS.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.130
SO, UH...

18:07.130 --> 18:09.040
I SEE.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.200
I'M PROBABLY WASTING YOUR TIME
AS WELL AS MINE.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.190
I MEAN,
I'M IN PERFECT HEALTH.

18:13.190 --> 18:17.030
MY HEARING ISN'T AS GOOD
AS IT USED TO BE,

18:17.030 --> 18:19.080
BUT I HAVE THESE AMAZING
HEARING AIDS NOW, AND I...

18:21.160 --> 18:24.060
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

18:24.060 --> 18:27.200
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE
TO BE H.I.V.-POSITIVE

18:27.200 --> 18:30.140
FOR I-I DON'T KNOW,
LET'S SAY DECADES,

18:30.140 --> 18:32.180
AND NOT KNOW?

18:32.180 --> 18:34.180
IF YOU'RE ASKING
IF YOU COULD BE POSITIVE

18:34.180 --> 18:36.180
AND COMPLETELY ASYMPTOMATIC...
RIGHT.

18:36.180 --> 18:39.200
THE ANSWER IS YES.
I SEE.

18:39.200 --> 18:43.050
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT TYPICAL,
BUT IT CAN HAPPEN.

18:43.050 --> 18:44.230
WOW.

18:44.230 --> 18:47.030
I TAKE IT YOU'VE NEVER
BEEN TESTED BEFORE.

18:47.030 --> 18:50.080
NO. NO, NO. I-I JUST
NEVER THOUGHT THAT I NE--

18:50.080 --> 18:52.080
IS THERE A REASON
FOR CONCERN NOW?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.020
YEAH.

18:54.020 --> 18:56.110
YEAH.

18:56.110 --> 18:59.050
UH, THIS FRIEND OF MINE--

18:59.050 --> 19:01.010
WE WERE TOGETHER
YEARS AGO--

19:01.010 --> 19:04.050
UH...

19:04.050 --> 19:06.000
I JUST FOUND OUT

19:06.000 --> 19:09.120
THAT HE--HE'S, UH,
LIVING WITH A.I.D.S.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.210
AND, UH...

19:13.230 --> 19:17.120
LISTEN, IF SOMEONE
TESTS POSITIVE,

19:17.120 --> 19:20.110
THERE ARE ALL SORTS
OF DRUGS THEY CAN TAKE NOW.

19:20.110 --> 19:23.110
A PERSON CAN LIVE A LONG,
HEALTHY LIFE THESE DAYS.
GOOD.

19:23.110 --> 19:26.010
WE COULD GET YOU TESTED
RIGHT NOW.
NOW? WOW.

19:26.010 --> 19:28.200
YOU'D KNOW TOMORROW MORNING,
ANYTIME AFTER 8:00.

19:28.200 --> 19:32.170
GOOD. OKAY.
LET'S GO FOR IT.

19:40.110 --> 19:42.110
OKAY, SO YOU DRY
THE FRISéE,

19:42.110 --> 19:45.200
AND I'LL START PUTTING
THESE EGGS IN.
YEAH.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.200
OH, SAUL, DID YOU PUT,
UM, VINEGAR IN THAT WATER?
YES, I PUT VINEGAR
IN THE WATER.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.030
I DO KNOW
HOW TO POACH AN EGG.
OKAY, RELAX.

19:51.030 --> 19:54.030
SCOTTY, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO JUMP ON YOU.

19:54.030 --> 19:56.170
I JUST... DIDN'T SLEEP
VERY WELL LAST NIGHT.

19:56.170 --> 19:59.210
WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT WHAT
WE TALKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

19:59.210 --> 20:03.040
NO.
BECAUSE I DIDN'T MEAN
TO PRESSURE YOU.

20:03.040 --> 20:06.090
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET TESTED--
COULD WE JUST CONCENTRATE
ON THE FRISéE SALAD, PLEASE?

20:06.090 --> 20:09.020
(mouths word)
HEY. ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO HEL--

20:09.020 --> 20:11.060
WHOA! OH.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

20:11.060 --> 20:13.190
LISTEN, REBECCA,
DO ME A FAVOR.

20:13.190 --> 20:16.000
THERE ARE TOO MANY COOKS
IN THIS KITCHEN.
UH, REBECCA,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.030
WOULD YOU MIND TAKING OUT
THESE EMPANADAS FOR ME?

20:19.030 --> 20:20.070
DEFINITELY.

20:20.070 --> 20:22.020
(door opens and closes)

20:22.020 --> 20:25.040
(mouth full)
HOW WAS THE DRIVE?

20:25.040 --> 20:28.090
OH, IT WASN'T BAD.
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T GO IN THE KITCHEN.

20:28.090 --> 20:30.170
EVERYBODY'S FREAKING OUT.
I'M GONNA GRAB A SWEATER.

20:30.170 --> 20:32.070
YOU WANT ONE, JUSTIN?
(scoffs)

20:32.070 --> 20:35.200
JUSTIN.
NO, I WOULD'VE ASKED.
THANK YOU, REBECCA.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.160
(normal voice)
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?

20:37.160 --> 20:39.200
WE'VE BEEN BETTER.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

20:39.200 --> 20:42.030
HOW YOU FEELING?
I FEEL FINE.

20:42.030 --> 20:44.020
WHAT DO THEY HAVE YOU
TAKING THESE DAYS?
TAKING?

20:44.020 --> 20:46.000
FOR YOUR HEART, ROBERT.
ATORVA,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
WHICH IS WHY I'M GONNA HAVE
SOME MORE OF THIS.
(Nora) WHOO-HOO.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.040
HI, GUYS.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.040
HOW WERE THE CROWDS?
THE CROWDS WERE LARGE,
FRIENDLY.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.040
WELL--
LOUD, EXCRUCIATINGLY LOUD.

20:57.040 --> 21:00.030
ROBERT, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?
(Robert) SURE.

21:00.030 --> 21:03.120
OH, DON'T GO IN THE KITCHEN.
SAUL MIGHT KILL YOU.
WHAT?

21:03.120 --> 21:06.030
(Sarah) THAT'S NICE.
OH, LOOK HOW CUTE.
THEY HAVE MENUS.

21:06.030 --> 21:08.030
SO LET'S SEE, THEY HAVE

21:08.030 --> 21:10.040
"LAMB BURGERS WITH YOGURT,

21:10.040 --> 21:12.040
CHIPOTLE MEATLOAF."

21:12.040 --> 21:14.230
OOH, YUM.
ANYONE WANT
SOME OLIVE TAPENADE?

21:14.230 --> 21:17.000
WINE, PLEASE.
(Nora) WINE, PLEASE.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.050
HERE.
OH, REBECCA, WHEN DO YOU
START YOUR NEW JOB?

21:20.050 --> 21:23.150
IT'S A SENSITIVE SUBJECT.
YEAH, SO MAYBE
WE SHOULD JUST DROP IT.

21:27.130 --> 21:29.220
ALL I AM SAYING, ROBERT,
IS THAT IT'S WEIRD.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.120
OKAY, I'VE TRIED TO TRACK

21:31.120 --> 21:33.120
CITIZENS FOR
A CORRUPT-FREE AMERICA,

21:33.120 --> 21:35.160
AND THEY ARE NOT
A REGISTERED LOBBYING GROUP.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.060
THEY DON'T EXIST ANYWHERE.

21:37.060 --> 21:40.070
I'M SURE IT'S JUST SOME
WING NUT WITH A COMPUTER.

21:40.070 --> 21:42.070
NO, THEY PUT IT UP
IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT PLACES.

21:42.070 --> 21:44.070
CABLE NEWS PICKED UP
THE PRIVATE JET STORY

21:44.070 --> 21:46.190
JUST AS WE WERE
COMING OFF THE BUS.
OKAY, WELL, LOOK, IT'S NOT--

21:46.190 --> 21:49.040
IT'S IRONIC.
IT'S NOT TRUE, SO--

21:49.040 --> 21:51.140
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S NOT TRUE, ROBERT.

21:51.140 --> 21:54.060
THERE IS SOMEBODY OUT THERE
WHO HAS A LOT OF INFORMATION

21:54.060 --> 21:56.150
AND A LOT OF EXPERIENCE,
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON,

21:56.150 --> 21:59.010
THEY'VE DECIDED
TO COME AFTER ME.
OKAY, LOOK,
YOU'RE UP IN THE POLLS,

21:59.010 --> 22:01.010
SO IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.
OKAY, IT MAKES SENSE,

22:01.010 --> 22:03.140
BUT I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIND OUT WHO IT IS.

22:03.140 --> 22:05.220
AND I'VE CALLED A COUPLE
OF MY FRIENDS, YOU KNOW,

22:05.220 --> 22:08.040
ON THE OTHER SIDE,
AND THEY FLATLY DENY IT.
HEY, LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT THIS.

22:08.040 --> 22:10.190
ROBERT, THEY BROUGHT UP
THE WIG...

22:10.190 --> 22:13.010
AND HOW MUCH IT COST.

22:13.010 --> 22:15.210
I MEAN, THEY BROUGHT UP
THE CANCER.

22:15.210 --> 22:19.020
I DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE GONNA
DO THAT, AND THEY--THEY DID.

22:29.050 --> 22:30.200
(water runs)

22:30.200 --> 22:32.150
(knife scrapes board)

22:32.150 --> 22:36.010
OH. TOO MUCH CILANTRO
IN THAT.
(water turns off)

22:36.010 --> 22:38.000
I'M SURE IT'S FINE.
MM.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.010
HOW'S EVERYONE DOING IN HERE?
OH, GREAT.
HE'S A LITTLE JITTERY.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.140
KEVIN, DROP IT. HE DIDN'T
SLEEP WELL LAST NIGHT.

22:42.140 --> 22:44.120
IT'S OUR FAULT.
OH, COME ON, SCOTTY,
FOR GOD SAKE.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.200
WHY IS IT OUR FAULT?
WHY, BECAUSE WERE TALKING

22:46.200 --> 22:48.180
ABOUT GETTING TESTED?
WHY ARE YOU EVEN WORRIED?

22:48.180 --> 22:50.130
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
AROUND THE BLOCK.

22:50.130 --> 22:53.040
YOU'VE BARELY SET FOOT
OUTSIDE YOUR OWN HOUSE.
WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP

22:53.040 --> 22:55.200
BEING SO PATRONIZING
AND CAVALIER ABOUT THIS?
OKAY, I'M SORRY
I EVER MENTIONED IT.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.150
ARE YOU?
YEAH.

22:57.150 --> 23:01.020
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING OF ME? DO YOU?

23:01.020 --> 23:03.150
THIS WORLD
THE TWO OF YOU LIVE IN,

23:03.150 --> 23:06.150
WHERE EVERYTHING IS SO EASY
AND SO MUCH IS POSSIBLE...

23:06.150 --> 23:08.150
YOU HAVE A SURROGATE
CARRYING YOUR CHILD.

23:08.150 --> 23:11.010
YOU'RE--YOU'RE MARRIED.
TECHNICALLY,
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

23:11.010 --> 23:12.230
OH, KEVIN, EXCUSE ME.
I'M SO SORRY.

23:12.230 --> 23:15.070
YOU'RE DOMESTIC PARTNERS.
WHATEVER. WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

23:15.070 --> 23:17.070
I JUST HOPED
THAT I WOULDN'T GET ARRESTED

23:17.070 --> 23:19.170
WHEN I WALKED INTO A GAY BAR.
SAUL, IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET TESTED, I'LL TOT--

23:19.170 --> 23:21.180
IT'S TOO LATE.
I ALREADY DID.
WHAT?

23:21.180 --> 23:23.120
I TOOK THE TEST
THIS MORNING.

23:23.120 --> 23:27.050
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD THING,
RIGHT?
IT'S GREAT FOR PEOPLE
LIKE YOU,

23:27.050 --> 23:29.050
BECAUSE IT'S
SPRING CLEANING FOR YOU.

23:29.050 --> 23:31.050
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU SAID,
YOU GO EVERY YEAR?

23:31.050 --> 23:33.130
BUT YOU SEE,
I NEVER OPENED THAT CLOSET.

23:33.130 --> 23:36.040
REGARDLESS OF THE WORLD
THAT YOU GREW UP IN,

23:36.040 --> 23:39.040
THE WORLD THAT I KNEW
WAS A LOT LESS ACCEPTING.

23:39.040 --> 23:42.050
PEOPLE DIED.

23:42.050 --> 23:44.000
DON'T YOU GET IT?

23:44.000 --> 23:47.100
FOR ME, BAD NEWS IS PO--

23:47.100 --> 23:49.100
SO WHY DON'T YOU
PLATE UP THIS FOOD?

23:49.100 --> 23:52.030
AND I WILL GET
SOME FRESH AIR.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.120
(door closes)

23:53.120 --> 23:55.220
IT'S JUST PUSHING MY BUTTONS
IS ALL.

23:55.220 --> 23:59.050
IT'S JUST MAKING ME
DOUBT EVERYTHING.

23:59.050 --> 24:01.070
WHAT ARE YOU DOUBTING?

24:01.070 --> 24:04.020
WELL, IT'S BEEN TWO MONTHS
SINCE MY LAST TEST.

24:04.020 --> 24:05.190
AND YOU WERE FINE.

24:05.190 --> 24:07.190
BUT I HAVE TO HAVE
ANOTHER ONE IN SIX MONTHS

24:07.190 --> 24:09.090
AND ANOTHER ONE AFTER THAT.

24:09.090 --> 24:11.050
IT'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THERE.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.030
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET SICK AGAIN.

24:13.030 --> 24:16.070
WHAT IF I DO?

24:18.120 --> 24:20.160
WHAT IF I REALLY...

24:20.160 --> 24:22.080
CAN'T HANDLE THIS?

24:22.080 --> 24:25.120
DON'T DO THIS. DON'T.

24:25.120 --> 24:27.120
DON'T LET ONE PERSON
DO THIS TO YOU.

24:27.120 --> 24:30.170
YOU ARE UP IN THE POLLS,
AND YOU HAD A BAD DAY.

24:30.170 --> 24:34.020
(sighs) OKAY, I AM GONNA GO
GET US SOME WINE. MWAH.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.120
(door opens)

24:42.150 --> 24:44.110
WHERE THE HELL IS HE GOING?

24:44.110 --> 24:46.180
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.
BUT HE SEEMED REALLY UPSET.

24:46.180 --> 24:50.010
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA GO
TALK TO HIM.
MOM, STOP. DON'T.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.190
DON'T GET INVOLVED.

24:51.190 --> 24:54.020
KEEP DRINKING.
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I'LL GO TO THE KITCHEN, MOM.

24:54.020 --> 24:57.150
I WILL FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON, OKAY?
MM. I'LL COME WITH YOU
FOR MORAL SUPPORT.

24:57.150 --> 25:00.120
(cell phone rings)
WHY IS YOUR MOTHER
CALLING ME?

25:00.120 --> 25:02.120
I DON'T KNOW.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.030
(rings and beeps)

25:04.030 --> 25:06.070
HEY, HOLLY.

25:06.070 --> 25:08.000
WHAT'S UP?

25:08.000 --> 25:11.020
THEY'RE DRILLING AGAIN?

25:11.020 --> 25:14.140
WELL, WHO AUTHORIZED THAT?

25:14.140 --> 25:17.000
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
LOOK, SARAH, I CAN EXPLAIN--
NO, I WILL TALK TO HER.
THANK YOU.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
(beep)
MOM, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.220
LOOK, IT'S WORTH THE TIME
AND EFFORT. I KNOW IT.

25:24.220 --> 25:27.010
SO YOU PAID
FOR MORE DRILLING?

25:27.010 --> 25:29.120
IT'S MY MONEY.
THERE'S NOTHING THERE, MOM.

25:29.120 --> 25:32.120
IF THERE WAS, THEY WOULD'VE
FOUND IT BY NOW.
SARAH, IT'S JUST
A FEW MORE DAYS DRILLING.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.070
OH, GOD, MOM. I LOVE YOU,
BUT YOU HAVE TO STOP.

25:35.070 --> 25:37.030
YOU CANNOT SOLVE
EVERYBODY'S PROBLEMS--

25:37.030 --> 25:39.040
MINE, KITTY'S, SAUL'S.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.100
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE,
AS A FAMILY,

25:41.100 --> 25:44.180
WE CAN'T HELP EACH OTHER.
THEN HOW CAN I MOVE ON
IF YOU DON'T?

25:49.040 --> 25:51.010
(Justin) I NEED
MORE INFORMATION, ROBERT.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.150
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
REALLY WEIRD ABOUT THIS.

25:53.150 --> 25:55.140
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
I CAN SAY.

25:55.140 --> 25:58.030
WHY ARE YOU TAKING
AMIODARONE?

26:00.080 --> 26:03.040
I STARTED TO HAVE
SOME ARRHYTHMIA AGAIN.

26:03.040 --> 26:05.060
DOES KITTY KNOW?

26:05.060 --> 26:08.060
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE KNEW.
I'M SORRY. I SAW THE BOTTLE
ON YOUR DESK, ALL RIGHT?

26:08.060 --> 26:10.130
AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
YOU'RE HIDING IT FROM KITTY.

26:10.130 --> 26:13.210
WHAT IS GOING ON, ROBERT?
WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO DO HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH MY HEALTH.

26:13.210 --> 26:15.210
THEN WHAT IS IN
THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX?
JUSTIN, DON'T DO THIS.

26:15.210 --> 26:18.130
I NEED TO.
YOU CAN'T EXPECT ME TO JUST--
NO, I CAN EXPECT IT.

26:18.130 --> 26:21.040
THAT'S WHY I CHOSE YOU.
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.010
I'M SORRY. I'M WORRIED
ABOUT YOU, ROBERT.

26:24.010 --> 26:25.210
GIVE ME THE KEY BACK.

26:25.210 --> 26:28.180
I MEAN IT. I CLEARLY CHOSE
THE WRONG PERSON.

26:28.180 --> 26:30.030
(door opens)

26:30.030 --> 26:31.230
HEY, GUYS.
TASTING MENU'S READY.

26:31.230 --> 26:34.010
EXCUSE ME.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.230
IS HE OKAY? 'CAUSE HE SEEMS
A LITTLE TESTY.

26:40.230 --> 26:43.230
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE--HE'S FINE. HE'S FINE.

26:43.230 --> 26:45.090
(footsteps approach)

26:45.090 --> 26:47.120
UNCLE SAUL, I--I'M...

26:47.120 --> 26:49.080
SORRY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE--

26:49.080 --> 26:53.000
IT'S OKAY. COME ON.
LET'S GO EAT.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.030
MENUS.

27:00.030 --> 27:02.040
THANK YOU.
MENUS.

27:08.230 --> 27:10.180
THANK YOU.

27:10.180 --> 27:12.180
MENUS.

27:12.180 --> 27:15.040
(Scotty) OKAY, SO, UH, THE IDEA
BEHIND OUR RESTAURANT

27:15.040 --> 27:18.090
IS COMFORT FOOD MEETS ORGANIC
MEETS <i>TAPAS.</i>

27:18.090 --> 27:21.000
AND WE ARE VERY HOPEFUL
AND VERY OPTIMISTIC.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.110
WE BETTER BE,
'CAUSE WE OPEN IN A MONTH.

27:23.110 --> 27:25.160
SO, UM, YOU ALL HAVE
YOUR MENUS.

27:25.160 --> 27:28.050
UM, MARK DOWN WHAT YOU LIKE
IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE.

27:28.050 --> 27:30.160
AND I WANT EVERYBODY'S OPINION,
NOT JUST KEVIN'S.
(clears throat)

27:30.160 --> 27:32.160
SO, UH, DIG IN.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:32.160 --> 27:34.010
(Kevin) WHAT'S WRONG?
ROBERT?

27:34.010 --> 27:37.050
I THINK SOMEONE
SHOULD CALL 9-1-1.
WHAT'S WRONG?

27:37.050 --> 27:39.090
(Kitty) ROBERT. ROBERT.
(Kevin) JUSTIN!

27:39.090 --> 27:41.010
(Justin) CALL 9-1-1.
(Kitty) WHAT'S HAPPENING?

27:41.010 --> 27:43.020
YOU OKAY? YOU OKAY?
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
(phone beeps)

27:43.020 --> 27:44.180
LOOK AT ME. BREATHE.
JUST BREATHE, ALL RIGHT?

27:51.200 --> 27:55.020
(indistinct conversations)

28:03.010 --> 28:06.050
OH.

28:06.050 --> 28:08.160
OH, HEY.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.030
OH, WOW. WHAT TIME IS IT?
IT'S EARLY.

28:11.030 --> 28:14.050
(sighs)
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

28:14.050 --> 28:16.110
I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU.
WHAT COULD BE BETTER?

28:16.110 --> 28:19.030
HMM. I NEED COFFEE.

28:19.030 --> 28:22.060
I WILL CALL ROOM SERVICE.
(sighs)

28:25.020 --> 28:28.120
YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

28:28.120 --> 28:30.020
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

28:30.020 --> 28:33.100
YOU HAVE BEEN WALKING AROUND
WITH AN ARRHYTHMIA,

28:33.100 --> 28:35.100
AND YOU NEVER BOTHERED
TO TELL ME.

28:35.100 --> 28:37.030
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO...

28:37.030 --> 28:39.000
DIDN'T--DIDN'T WANT WHAT?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.130
I--TO HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN ME AND THE CAMPAIGN.

28:41.130 --> 28:43.130
THAT'S WHAT GROWN-UPS DO.

28:43.130 --> 28:47.020
WE TALK ABOUT IT
AND WE SET PRIORITIES.

28:47.020 --> 28:52.030
BUT I WANT YOU TO WIN.
ROBERT, WE HAD TO CALL
AN AMBULANCE.

28:52.030 --> 28:54.010
LOOK...

28:54.010 --> 28:56.030
I GOT DIZZY, ALL RIGHT?

28:56.030 --> 28:58.030
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE SAID ANYTHING.

28:58.030 --> 29:00.050
(laughs) YOU ARE--
I--I'M SORRY.

29:00.050 --> 29:03.010
SERIOUSLY,
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.
I'M--I'M--I'M SORRY.

29:03.010 --> 29:05.000
YOU KNOW THAT?
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.230
YOU JUST WILL NEVER ACCEPT
ANYTHING FROM ANYONE.

29:08.230 --> 29:11.220
YOU ARE INCREDIBLY STOIC,

29:11.220 --> 29:15.030
AND I...

29:15.030 --> 29:18.020
I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU.

29:18.020 --> 29:20.020
I REALLY DO.

29:20.020 --> 29:22.170
BUT, YOU KNOW, I ALSO
LOVE THE PART OF YOU

29:22.170 --> 29:24.020
THAT IS VULNERABLE.

29:24.020 --> 29:26.180
I LOVE THE PART OF YOU
THAT NEEDS ME.

29:26.180 --> 29:30.130
WHEN YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT
TIE TO WEAR, I AM IN HEAVEN.

29:30.130 --> 29:32.130
WHEN YOU CAN'T FIND
YOUR GLASSES, I--

29:32.130 --> 29:34.140
FORGET ABOUT IT. I'M...

29:34.140 --> 29:38.040
(sighs) I JUST DIDN'T FALL
IN LOVE WITH THE HERO.

29:38.040 --> 29:41.010
I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GUY
WHO WAS AFRAID THAT,

29:41.010 --> 29:43.010
AFTER HIS HEART ATTACK...

29:43.010 --> 29:46.230
HE WASN'T GONNA BE ABLE
TO KEEP UP WITH HIS KID.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.030
(inhales and exhales deeply)

29:53.030 --> 29:55.040
LOOK...

29:55.040 --> 29:59.070
I MAY HAVE GOTTEN MYSELF
INTO A SITUATION.

29:59.070 --> 30:02.140
THOSE HITS
THAT YOU'VE BEEN TAKING?

30:02.140 --> 30:04.110
THEY'RE DIRECTED AT ME.

30:04.110 --> 30:08.050
THEY'RE SHOTS ACROSS THE BOW
FROM A GUY NAMED STANTON.

30:08.050 --> 30:12.020
HE'S IN LINE
FOR A BIG DEFENSE CONTRACT.

30:13.210 --> 30:16.090
GO ON.

30:18.010 --> 30:20.070
(exhales deeply)

30:20.070 --> 30:22.040
YOU'RE OUT EARLY.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.190
YEAH. I WENT
FOR A LITTLE WALK.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.040
AH.

30:26.040 --> 30:28.080
I JUST TALKED TO KITTY.
OH?

30:28.080 --> 30:31.000
SHE SAID
ROBERT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
THEY ARE RELEASING HIM
FROM THE HOSPITAL TODAY.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
OH, BOY. THAT'S GREAT.
THANK GOD, HUH?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.140
YOU'RE THE ONE
I'M WORRIED ABOUT.
ME?

30:37.140 --> 30:40.120
YEAH.
OH, I SEE. YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING TO THE BOYS.

30:40.120 --> 30:44.120
I'M SO SORRY I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE GOING THROUGH.

30:44.120 --> 30:47.150
PLEASE TELL ME ABOUT
THIS FRIEND OF YOURS.

30:47.150 --> 30:50.010
WHAT CAN I SAY?

30:50.010 --> 30:53.040
HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.130
I-I-I... (sighs)

30:55.130 --> 30:58.140
I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE
LIVING IN SHAME, NORA.

30:58.140 --> 31:02.010
THERE WERE NO ROLE MODELS
FOR ME WHEN I WAS GROWING UP.

31:02.010 --> 31:04.010
BUT YOU CAN'T BE ALONE
EVERY NIGHT,

31:04.010 --> 31:06.020
AND THERE--THERE WERE TIMES
WHEN I LET MYSELF--

31:06.020 --> 31:08.020
BUT IT WAS ALWAYS IN SECRET,

31:08.020 --> 31:10.050
AND IT WAS RARELY
WITH THE SAME PERSON,

31:10.050 --> 31:12.220
SO IT COULD NEVER BE
ANYTHING REAL.

31:12.220 --> 31:14.170
I MADE SURE OF THAT.

31:14.170 --> 31:18.120
DIDN'T YOU WORRY ABOUT WHAT
THAT MIGHT COST YOU?

31:18.120 --> 31:21.150
DON'T FORGET. WE KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON

31:21.150 --> 31:24.090
IN THOSE DAYS,
AND THERE WERE TIMES--
I MEANT COST YOU--
YOUR--YOUR HEART, YOUR SOUL.

31:24.090 --> 31:28.050
NO. NO, I C--I COULDN'T
LET MYSELF THINK THAT WAY.

31:28.050 --> 31:30.050
WELL, THEN IT'S TIME
TO START.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.050
YOUR LIFE IS NOT OVER YET.

31:32.050 --> 31:34.010
W-WHEN DO YOU GET
YOUR RESULTS?

31:34.010 --> 31:36.190
NOW. TODAY.
WHENEVER I WANT.

31:36.190 --> 31:39.150
GOOD. LET'S CALL, AND I'LL
SIT RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

31:39.150 --> 31:43.060
NO, I HAVE TO DO THAT
WHEN I'M ALONE. PLEASE.
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
WHAT IS WRONG WITH EVERYONE?

31:43.060 --> 31:45.160
WHAT, IS THERE A MORATORIUM
ON COMPASSION AROUND HERE?

31:45.160 --> 31:48.180
WE'RE FAMILY. THAT MEANS YOU
DON'T HAVE TO DO THINGS ALONE.

31:48.180 --> 31:51.010
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.090
YOU ARE SO PUSHY.

31:52.090 --> 31:54.010
WELL, TOUGH.

31:54.010 --> 31:55.160
HERE. TAKE THAT.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.010

I'M CALLING FOR THE RESULTS.
