WEBVTT

00:15.049 --> 00:17.718
George. George.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.688
What?
I heard something downstairs.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.524
It's just the house settling.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.293
It sounded like a door opening.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.728
Go back to sleep.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.197
I won't be able to unless you...

00:29.297 --> 00:30.998
Unless I check it out.

00:31.099 --> 00:33.567
Please.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.504
George,

01:10.604 --> 01:12.440
is everything okay?

01:27.955 --> 01:29.290
What's up, Doc?

01:29.390 --> 01:30.991
We praying?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.493
Absorbing the stillness

01:32.593 --> 01:34.595
that only the dead
can truly attain.

01:34.695 --> 01:38.266
Okay, well, our victim's
not getting any fresher. May I?

01:38.366 --> 01:39.667
Oh, by all means.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.335
Lacerated blood vessels

01:41.435 --> 01:43.103
around a fractured
supraorbital foramen

01:43.204 --> 01:46.707
indicate Captain Bernal was
killed by blunt force trauma.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.577
His wife succumbed
to a similar injury.

01:49.677 --> 01:52.045
No sign of sexual
assault on either.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.581
Almost looks like bite marks.

01:53.681 --> 01:54.948
Any idea what
the murder weapon was?

01:55.048 --> 01:58.419
A small, blunt object
with serrated edges.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.654
Wielded with great force.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.523
Doesn't exactly narrow it down.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.159
Not yet, but have faith.

02:05.893 --> 02:07.961
How long have they been dead?

02:08.061 --> 02:10.698
Both bodies have entered
secondary flaccidity.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.433
Best guess? 48 hours.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.067
Which tracks.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.970
Captain Bernal didn't report
for work the last two days.

02:17.070 --> 02:18.372
His office called HPD

02:18.472 --> 02:19.940
for a wellness check
this morning.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.642
All right, talk me through
what we know.

02:21.742 --> 02:25.313
So, the intruder surprised
Captain Bernal here.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.014
Took him down.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.583
Intruder then headed upstairs
and the bedroom was ransacked

02:29.683 --> 02:31.952
after Mrs. Bernal was murdered.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.454
How do you know?

02:33.554 --> 02:35.656
Check this out.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.392
Blood streaked on the drawers

02:38.492 --> 02:39.993
and the wall safe.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.529
Here.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.234
Jewelry and valuables stolen.
The classic

02:46.334 --> 02:47.901
robbery gone wrong.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.503
Or as intended.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.640
Maybe our suspect
wanted to hurt them. Maybe.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.408
But here's where it gets weird.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.576
There is no sign
of forced entry.

02:55.676 --> 02:56.977
No broken locks.

02:57.077 --> 02:58.646
No smashed windows.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.147
And get this...
You're about to tell me

03:00.248 --> 03:03.217
that the alarm was still armed
when HPD arrived.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.052
Yeah.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.520
How'd you know?

03:06.620 --> 03:09.423
Well, because
I've seen it before.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.559
Seven years ago.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.663
Rebecca Fox, 17 years old,

03:15.763 --> 03:17.631
daughter of Admiral Jason Fox,

03:17.731 --> 03:19.099
Pac fleet commander at the time.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.101
I mean, the case got
national attention.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.104
We were full-court press.
And you think the
cases are related?

03:24.204 --> 03:25.573
I know they are.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.775
It's a bit of a stretch,
isn't it?

03:27.875 --> 03:30.578
Other than robberies gone wrong.

03:30.678 --> 03:33.547
Look, no sign of forced entry.
Alarm engaged.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.783
Victims beaten
with a similar weapon.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.353
No trace evidence.
There's all kinds of the same.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.456
Okay.
When was the alarm first armed

03:42.556 --> 03:43.991
at Captain Bernal's house?

03:44.091 --> 03:46.794
Security company said it was
turned on two nights ago,

03:46.894 --> 03:49.229
at 9:00 p.m., and was
never turned off again.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.098
Well, then how did
the killer gain access?

03:51.198 --> 03:52.933
Second story window
above the garage.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.969
The sensor was deactivated.
Suspect climbed up a tree.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.439
Yeah, that's the one detail
that's different.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.207
Rebecca Fox's killer had a key.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.676
How is that possible?

04:02.776 --> 04:05.045
Petty Officer Sean Clark.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.947
He's Admiral
Fox's enlisted aide,

04:07.047 --> 04:08.416
which means
he would have

04:08.516 --> 04:10.818
a key and the alarm code.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.587
And Clark confessed
to the murder.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.823
Okay. Where's he now?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.691
Serving life at Halawa.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.793
Then he didn't do it.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.463
Clark may not have murdered
the Bernals himself,

04:22.563 --> 04:25.232
but these cases are related.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.634
You thinking copycat?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.068
You know, guys spend

04:28.168 --> 04:30.404
a lot of time in prison
trading war stories.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.640
Maybe Clark
inspired another inmate.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.342
I know it's not
a lot to go on,

04:34.442 --> 04:36.209
but I also know I'm not wrong.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.513
All right.
Let's see if you're right.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.082
We should meet with
the lead agent on the Fox case.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.584
Pick their brain.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.854
That may be
a little bit complicated.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.722
Lead agent was Jim Carter.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.926
What? What am I missing?

04:53.026 --> 04:55.429
Carter's no longer with NCIS.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.765
And I'm the reason why.

05:00.634 --> 05:04.438
Who am I?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.540
Who... am I?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.909
Who am I?

05:11.244 --> 05:13.046
Carla Chase?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.348
Incorrect, actually.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.484
At least, I'm not
entirely Carla Chase.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.852
Nor are you entirely
Ernie Malik.

05:18.952 --> 05:22.189
I go by many names,
especially online.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.557
Cool setup, by the way.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.527
I take it you're mapping
the insular cortex

05:26.627 --> 05:28.496
by asking yourself,
"Who am I?"

05:28.596 --> 05:29.730
Ooh, close.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.832
I was practicing
self-inquiry meditation.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.234
Ah, Ramana Maharshi.
Yes!

05:34.334 --> 05:36.904
Though he derived it from
the ancient Hindu tradition

05:37.004 --> 05:38.772
of Advaita Vedanta. Ooh.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.708
Something tells me
that the ancient gurus

05:40.808 --> 05:43.010
didn't use electrodes
to reach enlightenment.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.344
Well, they didn't have
hot and cold running water.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.114
Antibiotics, either.
Technology isn't all bad.

05:47.214 --> 05:48.816
Who you telling?

05:48.916 --> 05:50.117
As much as I enjoy
our metaphysical chats,

05:50.217 --> 05:51.619
I'm assuming you're here
with a purpose.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.821
Jesse's convinced
the Bernal murders

05:53.921 --> 05:55.188
connect to an old case.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.024
I brought you
the autopsy file.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.092
Clearly, you didn't look at it.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.695
I assisted
on the original autopsy.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.131
My first assignment at AFMES.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.733
Oh.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.736
Well, you think Jesse's right?

06:08.836 --> 06:10.504
The evidence suggests he is.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.873
The wound patterns for both
cases are almost identical.

06:12.973 --> 06:16.376
Likely caused by
a tactical flashlight.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.378
How can you tell?

06:18.479 --> 06:20.881
The teeth along the bezel
match the indentations

06:20.981 --> 06:22.315
around the victims' injuries.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.587
Rebecca Fox was struck
on the left brow,

06:26.687 --> 06:27.888
shattering her orbit
and forehead.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.857
So were the Bernals.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.925
All three victims were
struck at close range

06:32.025 --> 06:35.195
in nearly the same place
while facing their assailant.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.264
Did you get an DNA
from the Bernal house?
No.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.299
This killer was
exceedingly careful.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.934
And precise.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.903
We have enough to suggest
these murders are connected...

06:43.003 --> 06:45.405
But not enough
to point to a suspect.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.307
Well, there is one suspect
already convicted

06:47.407 --> 06:48.809
of the first crime.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.778
Maybe he has the answer.

06:50.878 --> 06:54.482
Sean Clark worked as
Admiral Fox's aide for months.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.584
Knew every detail of
his home and his routine.

06:56.684 --> 07:00.020
Then snuck into his house,
beat his daughter to death

07:00.120 --> 07:01.889
and watched as her
life drained away.

07:01.989 --> 07:04.191
How do you know that last part?
It's in the confession.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.759
He then calmly stole

07:05.859 --> 07:07.761
about $20,000
worth of cash and jewelry

07:07.861 --> 07:09.229
and walked into the night.

07:09.329 --> 07:12.299
Point being?
That he's a
stone-cold killer.

07:12.399 --> 07:15.335
Probably won't share
much with you.
I don't know.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
I can be pretty persuasive.
I know, boss,

07:17.538 --> 07:18.839
but do me a favor--

07:18.939 --> 07:20.340
don't proffer anything
off of his sentence.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.175
Sean Clark doesn't deserve
to see daylight again.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.044
I'm just gonna
talk to him, Jesse.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.598
Mr. Clark.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.868
I'm Special Agent in Charge
Jane Tennant. NCIS.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.703
I've been expecting you.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.371
You have?
Yeah.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.773
I knew at some point

07:52.873 --> 07:55.042
you guys would realize
I'm an innocent man.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.411
I'm confused, Mr. Clark.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.081
Please, call me Sean.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.553
You confessed
to Rebecca Fox's murder, Sean.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.920
But now you claim
you're innocent.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.990
I am innocent.
Always have been.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.959
Except when you signed
your confession.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.061
Because I was coerced.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.696
Which I've attested to
dozens of times

08:15.796 --> 08:16.897
over the last seven years.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.899
First I'm hearing of it.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.534
Then why are you here?

08:22.269 --> 08:23.771
Because of a double homicide

08:23.871 --> 08:27.007
that is similar
to Rebecca's murder.

08:30.143 --> 08:33.213
I need to know who you've been
talking to about your crimes.

08:33.313 --> 08:34.548
Cellmates,

08:34.648 --> 08:37.651
family, friends...
I don't have cellmates,

08:37.751 --> 08:39.820
family or friends anymore.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.755
Just a lawyer that
barely takes my calls.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.991
Clearly, you're talking
to someone, Sean.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.626
Because they mimicked
your killing.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.661
What part of "I'm innocent"

08:47.761 --> 08:49.029
don't you understand?!

08:59.306 --> 09:00.641
I'm sorry.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.243
So, why confess to something
that you didn't do?

09:03.343 --> 09:06.513
People make false confessions
all the time.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.549
I tried to recant the next day.
Ask Agent Carter.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.319
Your DNA, your fingerprints
were all over the Fox house.

09:12.419 --> 09:15.155
I was Admiral Fox's
enlisted aide.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.992
I practically lived at his
house, doing his chores.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.194
Spent more time there
than my own apartment.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.831
You were the only one
who had the alarm code.

09:23.931 --> 09:24.832
The key.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.800
The combination to the safe.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.669
Clearly, I wasn't.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.938
Then who?

09:31.038 --> 09:33.741
Maybe whoever did this.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.076
The DNA "evidence"

09:36.176 --> 09:38.511
is how Carter
got me to sign.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.781
Told me I'd be facing
life without parole

09:40.881 --> 09:42.616
if I didn't man up.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.919
Now it's only 20 to life.

09:48.021 --> 09:51.491
I was exhausted.
He wore me down.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.262
So he wrote up the confession
and I signed it

09:55.362 --> 09:57.931
hoping that someone would
come up with the truth.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.033
Carter wrote it up?
Yeah.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.870
It's all on the tape.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.405
You'll see how he forced me
into this.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.277
I'll look into it, Sean.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.413
No. I'm never gonna
see you again. Hey.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.884
If there's any validity to what
you're saying, I'll find it.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.086
The truth won't stay
hidden forever.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.396
I think Rebecca caught you
robbing her house

10:29.496 --> 10:31.231
and you made a big mistake.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.701
But you didn't mean to kill her.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.635
I didn't kill her.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.071
I didn't rob anything.
I wasn't there.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.973
Hey, hey, hey, I'm on your side.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.641
Okay?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.210
I'm the only one that is.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.045
Carter's got technique,
I'll give him that.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.646
You should just take it easy...

10:46.747 --> 10:48.281
Five hours in and he hasn't
broken a sweat

10:48.381 --> 10:49.683
or raised his voice.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.551
Yeah, I mean, he was
the best at good cop.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.253
You know, he was all
"pal" and "buddy"

10:53.353 --> 10:54.521
until he closed the deal.

10:54.621 --> 10:55.823
Look, buddy, I get it.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.825
Admiral Fox--
he's an arrogant ass.

10:57.925 --> 11:00.894
He refused to recommend you
to officer training.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.030
Told me I needed
to wait six months.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.332
That's an eternity
carrying his water.

11:05.432 --> 11:09.136
Sometimes being good
at your job works against you.

11:09.236 --> 11:11.071
Gets you stuck
in a crap position.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.606
Could make anyone lose
their cool.

11:13.707 --> 11:17.510
Make a bad decision.
Let that anger out.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.614
Clark is at his breaking point.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.852
Yeah, this is when
Carter will close it up.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.087
Just tell me everything.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.656
I think I need a lawyer.

11:29.757 --> 11:30.858
Whoa.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.793
Didn't see that coming.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.427
No, that's 'cause it
wasn't supposed to.

11:34.527 --> 11:37.564
First I'm gonna,
I'm gonna get you some food.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.672
Wait, what happened?
I don't know.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.908
A computer glitch or something?

11:48.008 --> 11:50.010
Now read it.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.413
And sign.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.948
Did we just skip ahead?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.549
No, man, this isn't...
this isn't right.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.251
Look at the time code.
A whole hour has passed.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.452
The camera got shut off.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.654
Hard part's done.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.157
I'm proud of you.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.658
I don't get it.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.995
Clark was adamant he was
innocent the whole night, right?

12:08.095 --> 12:10.230
Never once confirmed
any of the accusations.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.965
And then, what-- he just caves?

12:13.200 --> 12:14.401
What happened?

12:14.501 --> 12:15.903
<i>Jim Carter happened.</i>

12:16.003 --> 12:18.205
He broke Clark,
didn't want a record of it,

12:18.305 --> 12:19.539
so he cut the camera.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.408
That's quite
the accusation, boss.

12:21.508 --> 12:22.843
You're thinking it too.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.078
I don't know what I'm thinking.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.814
Okay, well, I just spent
the afternoon with a man

12:26.914 --> 12:28.816
who's pretty damn sure
that he's innocent.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.051
Told you not to
let him get to you.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.655
Have you ever spent time
with Sean Clark?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.757
No, I was there
when he was arrested.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.927
But no, not really.
He just doesn't seem like

12:40.027 --> 12:41.461
the cold-blooded
killing type.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.264
So, what are you saying?
I don't know yet.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.067
Let's focus on some facts.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.836
We got an inventory
of everything

12:48.936 --> 12:50.403
that was stolen from
the Bernal home.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.771
Might lead us to their killer.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.173
All right, I'll have
Ernie look at that.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.741
Cross-reference them
with the known fences.

12:54.842 --> 12:55.909
Check pawnshops, too.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.744
I can do it.
I actually

12:57.845 --> 13:00.780
need you for something else.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.650
Carter.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.186
You want me to ask about
the missing hour on the tape?

13:06.286 --> 13:07.720
Look, it's better
coming from you than me.

13:07.821 --> 13:09.422
Okay? You don't need
to confront him.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.691
Just find out if there's
anything about the case

13:11.791 --> 13:13.660
that we're missing.

13:13.760 --> 13:15.162
Like that hour.

13:16.830 --> 13:19.299
Yeah. On it, boss.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.005
<i>Damn it, Boone.</i>

13:25.105 --> 13:27.574
I look a thousand years older.

13:27.674 --> 13:28.708
You just look prettier.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.343
Clean living.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.682
I like the threads.
Yeah, head of
security, huh?

13:35.782 --> 13:37.784
Silky smooth.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.987
Big man on campus.
How's the gig?
It's sweet.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.522
There's more money,
less blood on the wingtips.

13:42.622 --> 13:43.723
Are you looking to make a move?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.092
I can make that happen.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.060
Ah, I still don't mind
the blood.
Really?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.429
Let me show you around. Huh?
Maybe you'll change your mind.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.664
Yeah, I don't know if I got time
for the grand tour,

13:51.764 --> 13:53.000
but I was, uh,

13:53.100 --> 13:55.268
I was hoping there was
someplace we could chat.

13:56.103 --> 13:57.938
That's your serious face. Oh...

13:58.038 --> 13:59.772
You want help with a case?

13:59.873 --> 14:02.675
One of your old cases, actually.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.812
I didn't leave any
open cases, kiddo.
No, it's not open,

14:05.913 --> 14:08.715
but, uh, you recall the, uh...

14:08.815 --> 14:11.318
Rebecca Fox murder, right?
Oh, yeah.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.686
I still talk to her father

14:13.786 --> 14:15.322
every year on the anniversary.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.125
I'm working a robbery
turned double homicide.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.792
But get this--
the alarm was still armed

14:19.893 --> 14:22.695
when HPD arrived, just like Fox.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.664
Okay, that sounds like
a coincidence.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.666
Ah, there's some other
details too, you know?

14:26.766 --> 14:28.001
I was hoping we could go
to your office.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.236
I want to walk you through it

14:29.336 --> 14:31.671
'cause it might help
clear up both cases.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.942
Sean Clark killed Rebecca Fox.

14:35.042 --> 14:38.111
There's nothing to
clear up there.
That's not what I meant, Jimmy.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.379
It's just, I don't remember
all the specifics

14:39.479 --> 14:40.613
about your case,

14:40.713 --> 14:42.282
and there might be
some details in there

14:42.382 --> 14:45.352
that could help with mine.
She sent you, didn't she?

14:47.754 --> 14:49.022
Who, Tennant?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.958
I mean, yeah.
She's the boss, so...

14:51.058 --> 14:53.126
Ha.
She is, Jimmy.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.129
And we're working a case
that resembles yours, so...

14:56.229 --> 14:58.498
If she wants to find out
about the Fox case

14:58.598 --> 15:01.101
she can look up the files,
watch the tape,

15:01.201 --> 15:03.170
read the fricking headlines.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.404
It's closed.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.905
Well, about that tape...

15:06.006 --> 15:07.807
What about it?
Well, there's,

15:07.907 --> 15:10.043
like, an hour missing.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.045
What do you know about that?

15:13.846 --> 15:15.915
Well, it's almost nice
to see you, kiddo.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.585
Come on, Jimmy. No.

15:18.685 --> 15:22.355
She wants to accuse
me of some B.S.,

15:22.455 --> 15:25.158
she's got to man up.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.826
Do it herself.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.505
Alex, dinner.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.308
All right, girlie, we are
gonna eat real quick

15:41.408 --> 15:43.010
and then I am
gonna teach you

15:43.110 --> 15:45.078
the secret Tennant
slipknot maneuver

15:45.178 --> 15:46.679
guaranteed to
deliver goals.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.050
That's okay, Mom.
No, no, no, I promised

15:50.150 --> 15:52.785
when you were ready, and
you have club tryouts tomorrow.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.722
I better focus
on my science reading.

15:55.822 --> 15:59.359
Um, said Julie Tennant never.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.261
No, really.
I'm behind, and...

16:01.361 --> 16:04.031
Oh, my God, Jules.
Just tell her.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.399
Tell me what?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.035
Nothing.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.502
Mom's gonna find out anyways.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.871
I will. Obviously.
So let's cut out the middle man.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.742
It's-it's just that...
Jules isn't trying out
for soccer.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.677
What?
Alex.

16:19.412 --> 16:21.148
Come in. Why?

16:21.248 --> 16:23.016
I just don't feel like it.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.052
Translation being
the team captain's mean to her.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.553
Alex.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.955
Julie.
Hello.

16:30.723 --> 16:31.758
Jim.

16:31.858 --> 16:34.427
I mean, you said come in, so...

16:34.527 --> 16:37.464
Sure.
Please, come in.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.337
Hey, guys, can I just
get a second? Just, can you...

16:48.141 --> 16:51.244
You sent Boone
to interrogate me?

16:54.114 --> 16:55.915
I sent him to ask for help.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.485
If you're calling me
into question,

16:58.585 --> 16:59.986
do it to my face.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.354
That's not what's happening.

17:01.454 --> 17:02.389
You don't have to use
your library voice

17:02.489 --> 17:03.656
with me, Tennant.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.426
Keeping up appearances.
Just us here.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.728
Actually, my kids
are in the other room.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.230
As you know.

17:10.330 --> 17:13.266
You've had it out for me
the minute you met me.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.903
And you won.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.471
You fired me.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.940
I didn't fire you.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.276
No. No, that's right.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.912
Jane Tennant
doesn't do the dirty work.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.414
You just...

17:27.514 --> 17:30.517
you just made sure I had
no other choice but to quit.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.586
You were openly hostile
and insubordinate.

17:33.686 --> 17:34.887
I was effective

17:34.987 --> 17:36.456
and that pissed you off.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.925
You ignored all of my directions
and made my job harder.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.861
So I reported you
to the IG and you--

17:41.961 --> 17:43.163
you resigned.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.997
You remember it
however you want.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.167
You're still doing it.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.936
Still making my job harder.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.340
You cut the camera for an hour

17:53.440 --> 17:55.508
during your interrogation
of Sean Clark.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.809
Why?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.412
It's not against the law.
Not my question.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.415
Why'd you do it?
I don't have to take this.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.053
I'm sorry.

18:07.154 --> 18:08.988
Am I standing in your home

18:09.088 --> 18:11.158
with your kids
in the other room?

18:15.895 --> 18:17.997
Well, this was a waste of time.

18:23.336 --> 18:26.406
If you coerced Clark
into confessing, I'll find out.

18:45.292 --> 18:47.994
He just turns up at her place?

18:48.094 --> 18:50.897
Yeah, with Alex and
Julie right there.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.533
This guy your friend?

18:53.633 --> 18:56.436
He was like a
mentor, you know?

18:56.536 --> 18:59.138
Something changed when
Tennant showed up to Pearl.

18:59.239 --> 19:02.275
He just had it made up in
his mind she was no good.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.644
Our Tennant?
Yeah,

19:04.744 --> 19:05.912
it's crazy.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.880
And when she made SAC,
he lost it.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.350
Probably 'cause she got
promoted over him.
Don't know.

19:10.450 --> 19:14.521
Partly. But, I mean, he gave
the last SAC a hard time, too.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.256
One of those cowboy cops,
you know?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.524
Old-school mentality.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.426
So, what's she gonna
do about him?

19:19.526 --> 19:21.894
Hit the gym.
Beat up the heavy bag.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.163
Focus on the case.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.266
Ernie said it's, uh,

19:26.366 --> 19:28.000
stall with the
flags, right?

19:28.100 --> 19:30.203
This is our fence.

19:31.338 --> 19:34.040
Hey, Vinh, right?
Yeah, we emailed you

19:34.140 --> 19:36.643
about that '82 Rolex Submariner.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.045
Yeah, is it, uh...

19:39.145 --> 19:41.348
I don't see it in here.

19:43.583 --> 19:46.185
I don't keep
the good stuff on display.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.655
Only for serious connoisseurs.

19:49.956 --> 19:53.125
Don't worry.
I got you.

20:02.769 --> 20:06.205
Sweet little piece, right?
Oh, yeah.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.874
Looks familiar?

20:07.974 --> 20:09.842
Just what we were looking for.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.110
Matte dial,

20:11.210 --> 20:14.213
original crystal.
Mint condition, brother.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.115
Oh, it's not completely mint.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.917
Serial number's scratched off.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.719
Ain't nothing
in life is perfect.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.721
Just a little wear and tear.
It's interesting.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.557
Wear and tear only affected
the serial number.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.928
You guys gonna
make an offer or not?

20:29.028 --> 20:30.630
Yeah, here's the offer.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.765
We're gonna take the watch,
the rest of them, too.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.967
And you into custody.
Federal agents.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.804
That watch was likely stolen
in a robbery.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.072
Cool down, guys, I-I didn't
rob nothing from nobody.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.174
Okay, you guys want the watches?

20:42.275 --> 20:43.476
Take 'em, bro!

20:45.812 --> 20:47.480
Damn it. Why didn't
you grab him?

20:47.580 --> 20:49.282
Hey, why didn't you grab him?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.018
Move, move, move.
Whoa!

20:53.353 --> 20:55.154
Wardrobe change.
All right. Split up.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.357
We got to find him fast.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.573
Sorry.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.111
Federal agent. Move!

21:19.211 --> 21:22.449
Hey, buddy, federal agents.
I need your cart. Thanks.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.267
Should have just
given us the watch.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.445
All right,
I'm out of here.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.713
Hey, don't forget your lunch.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.014
I'll just grab
something at school.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.716
Or you can take
the bento box

21:56.816 --> 21:58.751
that I just spent 30 minutes
making for you.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.286
I'm not gonna have much time.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.054
Alex, there's always
time for lunch. Mom.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.289
What the heck, Alex?

22:03.390 --> 22:05.792
Just take it, okay?
Don't be an ass.

22:07.494 --> 22:10.697
Uh... yeah.
Sure. Good plan.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.269
Uh, so...

22:18.671 --> 22:19.772
What was that?

22:19.872 --> 22:22.375
I know, right?
He's so rude.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.613
I meant you, sweetie.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.149
You seem very passionate about
your brother's lunch today.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.819
He should be nicer. Sure.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.921
But there's something else.

22:35.021 --> 22:36.889
Is this about soccer tryouts?

22:36.989 --> 22:38.758
No. I'm gonna try out.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.359
Okay, then what?

22:41.928 --> 22:43.863
You know that Carter guy
last night?

22:44.897 --> 22:47.133
Why did he talk to you
like that?

22:48.367 --> 22:49.836
Well...

22:51.003 --> 22:52.905
He and I used to
work together.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.307
But we didn't
really get along.

22:55.408 --> 22:57.877
That doesn't really
tell me anything.

22:57.977 --> 23:01.481
It's kind of
hard to explain. Try.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.656
Jim Carter doesn't
like me very much.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.459
He didn't like
having me as his boss.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.994
And he let everyone know.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.430
So he's a bully.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.098
Well, yeah.
Sort of.

23:19.198 --> 23:21.834
But the way he sees it,

23:21.934 --> 23:23.402
I'm the bully.

23:23.503 --> 23:24.904
How could he think that?

23:26.405 --> 23:30.009
I have asked myself that
for a very long time.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.711
Don't have a good answer.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.780
Well, I like you.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.815
Thanks, baby.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.250
I like you, too.

23:39.285 --> 23:42.789
And I want to punch that
Carter guy in the face.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.057
Oh, man.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.298
Morning, guys.
Morning, boss.

23:52.398 --> 23:55.535
Hey. Triple Red Eye,
as requested.

23:55.635 --> 23:58.004
You are a godsend.
Thank you.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.540
Did you get anything
from the fence?
No.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.074
Lawyered up. Not talking.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.877
But we don't need him to
because all his stuff is hot.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.946
About 60 grand
in stolen watches.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.015
None linked to
the Bernals, though.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.450
Got it.
So we're nowhere.

24:11.551 --> 24:12.985
Not exactly.

24:13.085 --> 24:15.522
One of the watches tracks
to another admiral

24:15.622 --> 24:17.490
who was robbed last year.

24:17.590 --> 24:20.392
Wait, I'm sorry.
Another admiral?
Yeah, in Norfolk.

24:20.493 --> 24:23.663
He was beaten as well,
but he survived.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.365
So we have three robberies

24:26.465 --> 24:27.900
involving high-ranking
Navy officials

24:28.000 --> 24:29.101
in two different cities.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.237
More than a coincidence,
I'd say.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.906
No, that's a pattern.
Figure our suspect
stole the watch

24:34.006 --> 24:36.643
in Norfolk and sold it
here in Hawai'i.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.545
Okay, that suggests that
when he robbed Admiral Fox

24:38.645 --> 24:40.580
seven years ago, he got rid
of the property somewhere else.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.315
If the same suspect
robbed Admiral Fox.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.885
It's becoming
less and less of an "if."

24:45.985 --> 24:48.020
Let's check NCIC.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.756
Find out if any of
Admiral Fox's property

24:49.856 --> 24:51.457
showed up over the years
in other cities.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.864
You okay after last night?

24:58.931 --> 25:03.035
I'm fine.
Julie, not so much.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.871
She and Alex
saw the whole thing.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.173
Well, maybe it's time
I go to his place,

25:07.273 --> 25:08.741
rearrange his attitude.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.644
I appreciate your willingness
to avenge my honor,

25:11.744 --> 25:14.180
but I handled it.
Yeah, but you shouldn't have to.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.015
I mean, it's kind of my fault.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.751
How on earth is Carter
your fault?

25:18.851 --> 25:20.486
I was too nice to him.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.321
Made him feel like
we're on the same side.
Okay, look,

25:22.421 --> 25:25.057
Carter's issues with me
have nothing to do with you.

25:25.157 --> 25:26.793
Plus, I sent you to
make nice with him.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.327
I didn't mean yesterday.

25:29.228 --> 25:30.663
When you took over SAC,

25:30.763 --> 25:33.365
I was one of the boys
sitting on the sidelines

25:33.465 --> 25:35.501
watching you and Carter
hash it out.

25:36.703 --> 25:40.006
That wasn't your fight.
And you weren't alone.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.941
Everybody loved Carter,

25:42.041 --> 25:44.110
and everybody wanted
to protect him.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.378
Yeah, we were all wrong.

25:46.478 --> 25:49.448
He played by his own rules.
Didn't listen to the bosses.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.517
But your intervention
wouldn't have mattered.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.986
Carter was never gonna
tolerate me as boss.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.688
You could say that again.

25:55.788 --> 25:59.058
This guy definitely has the
control aversion of a teenager.

25:59.158 --> 26:02.028
Control aversion?
He hates being told what to do.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.496
By SACs, his wife, the dentist.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.232
At least,
according to his email.

26:06.332 --> 26:07.700
You hacked his email?

26:07.800 --> 26:10.402
No. I mean yes.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.640
His, uh, deactivated NCIS email.
Not his personal one.

26:13.740 --> 26:16.142
Though I could if you want...
It's... We're fine.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.777
Uh, all right.
What'd you find?

26:17.877 --> 26:21.347
As important as the Rebecca Fox
investigation was,

26:21.447 --> 26:23.415
he was cutting corners
to close the case.

26:23.515 --> 26:26.052
Well, there was a lot of
pressure to find the suspect.

26:26.152 --> 26:27.787
Not just <i>the</i> suspect.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.188
Any suspect.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.491
What do you mean?
There are some emails here

26:32.591 --> 26:35.361
about a witness
named Don Mercado.

26:35.461 --> 26:38.064
Claimed he saw the killer
leave the Fox house

26:38.164 --> 26:39.699
the night of the murder.

26:39.799 --> 26:42.134
I don't remember a witness
statement from a Don Mercado.

26:42.234 --> 26:45.071
That's because
Carter didn't include it.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.472
He met with Mercado.

26:46.572 --> 26:48.540
Deemed him unreliable
because he was homeless.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.443
Told the SAC at the time
it was a dead end.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.179
Carter didn't think
he was reliable

26:53.279 --> 26:54.580
because he was homeless?

26:54.681 --> 26:56.382
Do we have any idea
what Mercado's story was?

26:56.482 --> 26:58.350
Well, that is not on the email.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.452
But I did track Mercado down

27:00.552 --> 27:03.255
at a homeless shelter
in Chinatown.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.029
There's literally
hundreds of people

27:10.129 --> 27:12.865
that go in and out of here
all day.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.201
Maybe that volunteer can help.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.237
Excuse me.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.906
Sorry to interrupt.
One sec, hold on.

27:20.006 --> 27:23.042
Special Agents Boone
and Holman. NCIS.

27:23.142 --> 27:25.477
We're, uh, looking for

27:25.577 --> 27:27.880
a regular resident here
named Don Mercado.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.749
He's not a resident anymore.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.417
But you have found him.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.620
I run the place.

27:34.721 --> 27:36.488
How can I help?

27:37.289 --> 27:39.325
Been thinking about
this a long time.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.460
So, you remember making
a witness statement?

27:41.560 --> 27:43.262
I remember like
it was yesterday.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.798
It was so spooky.
Spooky how?

27:45.898 --> 27:48.801
Like seeing a <i>kepalo</i> climb out
somebody's second-story window

27:48.901 --> 27:50.302
in the middle of the night.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.340
<i>Kepalo?</i>
It's like a... evil spirit.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.642
Or the bogeyman. Yeah.

27:56.743 --> 27:59.678
If the bogeyman
wore a red hazmat suit.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.281
He was wearing a hazmat suit?

28:02.381 --> 28:04.817
That's what it looked like. Freaky.

28:04.917 --> 28:08.354
Can you tell us anything else
about this guy you saw?

28:08.454 --> 28:10.622
Short.
Stocky.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.159
Couldn't see his face
'cause of the mask.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.161
And he was turned away
when he took it off.

28:15.928 --> 28:19.165
But he took his mask off?
In the yard before he left.

28:19.265 --> 28:23.169
His back was to me.
He had sandy hair.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.973
Sean Clark has dark hair,

28:27.073 --> 28:29.075
and is about six foot.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.243
You said all this

28:31.343 --> 28:32.812
in your statement
to the authorities?

28:34.013 --> 28:35.748
A Special Agent Carter.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.484
And what'd he say?
Nothing.

28:38.584 --> 28:41.687
Thanked me for my statement.
Never got back to me.

28:41.788 --> 28:43.122
But the guy
in the red hazmat suit

28:43.222 --> 28:44.290
coming out of the window?

28:44.390 --> 28:46.258
Real as you and me.

28:47.994 --> 28:49.728
<i>Hazmat suit</i>

28:49.829 --> 28:51.497
explains the lack of DNA.

28:51.597 --> 28:54.233
Could help us track a suspect.
Yeah, I did
some research.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.169
Level A hazmat suits are
often red in color.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.306
Submariners have access
to escape immersion equipment.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.208
Resembles a red hazmat suit.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.110
Yes, but Sean Clark
didn't work anywhere

29:04.210 --> 29:05.711
near chemicals or submarines.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.814
No, but he had the
code to the alarm,

29:07.914 --> 29:10.682
and how would a suspect avoid
triggering it without that?

29:10.783 --> 29:12.251
What if he was
already in the house

29:12.351 --> 29:14.153
when Rebecca set the alarm?

29:14.253 --> 29:15.721
So, he was hiding there
for hours?

29:15.822 --> 29:17.890
You'd think Carter
would have found some evidence.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.458
Unless he missed it.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.394
Like he missed Don Mercado.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.631
Go back to the Fox house.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.699
See if you can find
a viable hiding place.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.275
Must be hard on the admiral.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.344
Having us stir
all this up again.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.180
He doesn't come here
much anymore, anyway.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.082
I don't blame him.

29:43.182 --> 29:45.084
That must be the window

29:45.184 --> 29:48.020
Don saw the killer
exiting through.
Active neighborhood.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.156
He'd have to enter early
and wait all day.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.024
Could be an attic.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.226
Let's check it out.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.964
Feels like no one's been
up here for decades,

29:58.064 --> 30:00.399
let alone years. Yeah.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.102
Alarm sensor
was only activated

30:03.202 --> 30:04.503
if the window's closed,

30:04.603 --> 30:06.372
so, suspect could have
left it open.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.874
And then what--
just hung out?

30:07.974 --> 30:09.741
Well, if he was a submariner,

30:09.842 --> 30:12.544
hanging around in a small space
is no big deal.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.185
Will you look at that?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.453
It's a depression in
the insulation there.

30:21.553 --> 30:24.423
Somebody was sitting there.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.893
Tracks with Mercado's statement.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.162
Hey, you got a glove on you?
Yeah.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.936
Maybe our suspect...

30:37.036 --> 30:38.871
wasn't as careful as he thought.

30:40.039 --> 30:43.409
Hopefully kind enough
to leave behind a little DNA.

30:44.643 --> 30:46.745
How did Carter miss all this?

30:56.022 --> 30:58.324
This place feels
completely different.

30:58.424 --> 31:01.360
Yeah, well, got a face-lift
a few years ago.

31:01.460 --> 31:05.197
Nah, it's not that.
It's the smell.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.033
It's too clean.

31:09.635 --> 31:13.439
Maybe I just need
to mark my territory again.

31:13.539 --> 31:15.541
Hey, how you doing?

31:15.641 --> 31:17.443
Jim Carter.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.078
This used to be my desk.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.846
Kai Holman.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.548
Yeah, I guess it's mine now.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.352
Hell of a grip guy,
Kai. You serve?

31:26.452 --> 31:27.619
Yeah, Marines.

31:27.719 --> 31:30.289
It's nice to meet
a fellow devil dog.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.294
Excuse me.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.832
One of hers, huh?

31:50.876 --> 31:52.444
Love the decor.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.513
But it doesn't feel like
too much police work

31:54.613 --> 31:56.015
happens in here.

31:57.316 --> 32:00.452
Hey, Jimmy,
we're in the conference room.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.654
Why don't you ask me
your questions?

32:02.754 --> 32:05.257
No, we're gonna wait
for boss to do that. Yeah,

32:05.357 --> 32:08.627
making me wait.
It's a real power move.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.096
Yeah.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.164
Hey, get up.
I'm cool.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.100
I'm just gonna hang right here.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.801
So,

32:15.901 --> 32:18.004
make yourself comfortable.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.107
Isn't this awkward?

32:22.041 --> 32:24.410
It's only 'cause
you're trying so hard.

32:32.985 --> 32:35.554
You have him trained
really good.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.158
Let's talk Rebecca Fox.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.760
Okay.
What am I looking at--

32:41.860 --> 32:43.262
bad insulation?

32:45.031 --> 32:46.798
That's Admiral Fox's attic,

32:46.898 --> 32:49.935
and evidence that somebody
was hiding in there for hours.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.337
That's a stretch.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.740
No, Carter, that's a detail.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.075
And the devil is in the details.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.743
This proves nothing.
In this case,

32:57.843 --> 33:00.312
the devil's in a tobacco tin
that we found in that attic.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.882
Forensics pulled DNA from it
and they're running it now.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.384
But it's not Sean Clark.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.254
What do you want from me?
I want you to pay attention.

33:08.354 --> 33:11.123
Okay, we have DNA, the attic,
and a witness who saw

33:11.223 --> 33:13.459
a suspect climb from
the second story window.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.927
Is this the homeless guy
who cried wolf?

33:16.028 --> 33:17.796
And we've just confirmed
that someone was hiding

33:17.896 --> 33:19.465
in the Bernal attic.

33:21.300 --> 33:24.470
My case is connected
to your case.

33:24.570 --> 33:25.971
Maybe.

33:26.072 --> 33:28.107
It's possible you got it wrong.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.209
You brought me here
to rub it in my face.

33:30.309 --> 33:32.411
I'm asking for your help.

33:33.945 --> 33:36.782
Okay, what do you notice
in this file?

33:36.882 --> 33:39.451
Were Bernal and Fox connected?
What are we missing?

33:39.551 --> 33:40.619
I don't know.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.288
It's been, uh...

33:42.388 --> 33:44.456
You know, it's been seven years.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.359
I mean, I'm not the...

33:49.595 --> 33:50.662
Huh.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.532
What?
Well, that's something.

33:53.632 --> 33:57.203
Both victims were insured
by the same insurance company.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.772
Maybe that's how
the killer targeted them.

34:00.872 --> 34:03.742
Captain Bernal and Admiral Fox's
home insurance policies had

34:03.842 --> 34:05.111
the same underwriter.

34:05.211 --> 34:07.379
Wait, but it doesn't
seem strange.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.015
High-ranking naval officers
stationed in Hawai'i.

34:10.116 --> 34:12.384
Fair enough.
It does start to get strange

34:12.484 --> 34:14.120
when we look at
the other regions.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.821
I've got six policies
from six different officers

34:15.921 --> 34:17.123
all over the country.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.691
Each one robbed
in the last seven years.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.527
Including two in Norfolk, huh?

34:21.627 --> 34:24.196
Those two robberies happened
in the same week last year.

34:24.296 --> 34:26.031
Your fence's Rolex was stolen

34:26.132 --> 34:28.167
as well as some
diamond earrings,

34:28.267 --> 34:29.835
a tennis bracelet,
two necklaces.

34:29.935 --> 34:32.571
Hey, any of the other robberies
include violent assault?

34:32.671 --> 34:33.905
Four of the six.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.541
So, who's the underwriter?

34:37.276 --> 34:39.378
Carrie Holland.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.513
36 years old,
lives in Carson City, Nevada,

34:41.613 --> 34:43.081
and has a brother--

34:43.182 --> 34:45.384
Petty Officer Jeffrey Holland,
30 years old,

34:45.484 --> 34:47.553
who happens to be a submariner.

34:48.354 --> 34:49.855
You called it.

34:49.955 --> 34:51.390
Holland's service record

34:51.490 --> 34:53.259
lines up with each
and every one of the robberies.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.827
So, he's using
his sister's database

34:55.927 --> 34:57.563
to identify high-value targets.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.632
He had means and opportunity.
Where is he now?

35:00.732 --> 35:02.067
Uh, sub's still at Pearl.

35:02.168 --> 35:03.502
Let's go pick him up.

35:03.602 --> 35:05.103
I already reached
out to his post.

35:05.204 --> 35:07.706
He's been on liberty
for the last few days.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.975
C.O. has no idea where he is.

35:20.819 --> 35:22.188
Okay, team.
We tracked the suspect's

35:22.288 --> 35:23.889
cell phone to this neighborhood,

35:23.989 --> 35:25.857
which means his next target is
likely one of the houses here.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.693
He may already be hiding
in one of the homes,

35:27.793 --> 35:29.628
so we need to get
the families to safety

35:29.728 --> 35:31.563
and search every inch
of every one of the homes.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.399
Consider the suspect
armed and dangerous.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.401
Any questions?

35:35.501 --> 35:36.735
Let's roll.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.958
All the houses evacuated?
Almost.

36:00.058 --> 36:02.127
Agents are trying to coax
an old lady out of her home.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.795
As soon as they do,
REACT's got the green light

36:03.895 --> 36:05.163
to search all the houses.
All right.

36:05.264 --> 36:08.434
Scarlett? Scarlett?
Ma'am. Ma'am.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.969
Please, you have to
let me go back.
Calm down. Over here.

36:11.069 --> 36:13.205
What's going on?
My daughter.

36:13.305 --> 36:15.106
She was here and-
and she's gone.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.942
I think she went back
into the house.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.077
Why would she do that?
The cat.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.747
She-she wanted to get the cat.
I told her no, but...

36:21.847 --> 36:24.816
Please, let me go get her.
It's okay. Look, I'll go.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.620
I'll go with you.
No, I need you out
here in the lookout.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.289
If Holland's in that house,

36:30.389 --> 36:31.923
I don't want him slipping out
the window when I'm inside.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.125
I don't want him
slipping in behind you either.

36:35.427 --> 36:38.297
All right, stay outside
but stay close.

36:49.174 --> 36:50.742
Scarlett?

37:02.388 --> 37:03.689
Scarlett, you home?

37:03.789 --> 37:05.491
I'm sorry.

37:05.591 --> 37:08.093
Oh. Hey.

37:08.193 --> 37:10.228
It's okay.
Are you Scarlett?

37:11.196 --> 37:12.998
I'm Jane.

37:13.098 --> 37:14.733
What's your cat's name?

37:14.833 --> 37:17.168
Pinkie.
Pinkie.

37:19.104 --> 37:21.640
Hey, can I hold Pinkie?

37:22.408 --> 37:24.075
Okay.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.813
Guess what? Your mom's
a little worried about you.

37:27.913 --> 37:28.914
So, what do you say

37:29.014 --> 37:32.318
you, me and Pinkie go find her?

37:32.418 --> 37:34.920
Yeah? Okay,
come on.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.157
Hi.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.992
Can you get Scarlett and Pinkie
back to their family?

37:41.092 --> 37:44.062
Okay.
Thank you.
Bye, Scarlett.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.702
Someone's upstairs.

37:51.737 --> 37:52.804
Think it's Holland?

37:52.904 --> 37:55.273
Thinking we find out. Quietly.

38:59.771 --> 39:00.739
You okay?

39:00.839 --> 39:02.641
Yeah. You?
Yeah.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.042
We get him?

39:06.244 --> 39:07.946
We got him.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.628
Suspect down.
All clear.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.796
Copy.

39:32.871 --> 39:36.708
I heard you got the guy
who killed your captain

39:36.808 --> 39:38.109
and his wife. Yeah.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.946
It's a submariner named,
uh, Jeffrey Holland.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.715
His DNA matched
the tobacco tin

39:43.815 --> 39:45.784
that we found in
Admiral Fox's attic.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.419
Okay.

39:48.454 --> 39:52.458
Means Clark's innocent.
He'll be exonerated.

39:53.459 --> 39:55.060
Well, why you telling me?

39:57.228 --> 39:58.396
He spent seven years in prison

39:58.497 --> 40:00.799
for something
he didn't do, Jimmy.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.635
What do you want?

40:03.735 --> 40:06.071
I did the work.

40:06.171 --> 40:09.007
I followed the leads.
I got the confession.

40:10.341 --> 40:12.744
If he was innocent...
He <i>is</i> innocent.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.613
Then he shouldn't
have confessed.

40:15.514 --> 40:17.649
You know what you did
in that interrogation room.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.585
Yeah. My job.

40:19.685 --> 40:22.621
No, your job is to
uphold the law.
Which I did.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.656
Yeah?
Then why cut the tape?

40:24.756 --> 40:26.157
You know, kiddo...

40:27.125 --> 40:29.394
...nobody would have
given a crap

40:29.495 --> 40:32.731
about the tape
if Clark had done it.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.534
Okay, but he didn't
do it, Jimmy. Yeah,

40:35.634 --> 40:38.904
but everyone-- and I mean
everyone, including you--

40:39.004 --> 40:41.239
was convinced he was the guy.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.312
That's the job.

40:47.412 --> 40:49.948
Win some, lose some.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.786
Now, look, just...

40:54.886 --> 40:57.455
Stay in touch, Jesse.

40:59.491 --> 41:00.892
Or don't.

41:13.739 --> 41:15.574
Mom.
Mom.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.008
Are you guys making dinner?

41:17.108 --> 41:19.010
Don't be so shocked, Mom.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.547
Okay, I'm just trying
to figure out your angle.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.915
There's no angle.
'Cause we're not getting a dog.

41:24.015 --> 41:25.817
Mom, we're just trying
to take care of you.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.218
How are you?

41:27.318 --> 41:28.453
I'm okay.

41:28.554 --> 41:31.122
It's been a rough
few days for you.

41:31.222 --> 41:32.891
Let's eat on the lanai.

41:32.991 --> 41:35.961
But you guys
are really freaking me out.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.863
Does this have anything
to do with your tryouts?

41:37.963 --> 41:39.598
Other than I made the team?

41:39.698 --> 41:41.833
Baby, yeah!

41:41.933 --> 41:43.835
She's leaving a part out.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.937
Sit down.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.373
I walked up to the
team captain and said,

41:48.473 --> 41:50.341
"Becca, we may not
like each other,

41:50.441 --> 41:51.710
"but we're on
the same team.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.211
So let's act like it."

41:54.079 --> 41:57.583
Wow.
And what did she say?

41:57.683 --> 42:00.919
Uh, she kind of made a face
and then walked away.

42:01.019 --> 42:04.322
But not everyone can
like you, right, Mom?

42:04.422 --> 42:05.791
Yeah.

42:05.891 --> 42:08.526
Right. Um...

42:10.562 --> 42:11.763
Look, I'm okay.

42:11.863 --> 42:13.398
Really.

42:16.001 --> 42:17.936
Here you go, Mama.

42:18.036 --> 42:19.204
Yes.
Dig in.

42:19.304 --> 42:22.240
Thank you.
It smells amazing.

42:22.340 --> 42:25.210
Now... about that dog.
