WEBVTT

00:06.528 --> 00:08.138
- So you may have heard about
the new ownership,

00:08.182 --> 00:09.705
but we're still Cloud 9,

00:09.748 --> 00:11.707
Zephra is just
our new parent company.

00:11.750 --> 00:14.318
- And just like any time a new
parent comes into the picture,

00:14.362 --> 00:16.277
I'm sure it's gonna be
smooth sailing.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.236
- I think it's cool that
Zephra has a lady CEO.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.369
Or should I say "She-E-O"?

00:21.412 --> 00:22.979
- You don't need to.
No.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.111
- The press release says

00:24.154 --> 00:25.677
that the new company's
based in California.

00:25.721 --> 00:28.289
Are we all gonna have to start
caring about the environment?

00:28.332 --> 00:29.551
- No, the buy-out
won't interfere

00:29.594 --> 00:30.726
with you destroying
the planet.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.293
- Well, I heard
they're turning our stores

00:32.336 --> 00:33.555
into fulfillment centers.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.557
- Wait, we're gonna get
laid off?

00:37.124 --> 00:40.475
Okay, nobody--no, guys!
Guys.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.694
Calm down, it's--
it's all gonna be fine.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.349
Look, Corporate
sent over a memo that says,

00:45.393 --> 00:48.918
"Cloud 9 is excited about
this exciting new chapter

00:48.961 --> 00:50.746
full of exciting
possibilities."

00:50.789 --> 00:53.096
- An alarming number of times
to say "exciting."

00:53.140 --> 00:55.794
- Look, there's no point in
speculating about the future.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.274
So let's just calm down,

00:57.318 --> 00:59.102
and let me get through
shift assignments.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.321
- I heard there might
be a payout.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.540
- Really?
- Heather, you're in Housewares.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.499
- Well, I wonder how much.
- I heard four grand.

01:04.542 --> 01:05.978
- How?
Justine just said it.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.371
- Rumors travel fast,
Garrett.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.373
- Elias, if you could please
just float between...

01:09.417 --> 01:10.809
- I can't learn Chinese.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.550
- Yeah, they're definitely
moving us to China.

01:12.594 --> 01:13.899
That's what I heard.

01:13.943 --> 01:16.119
- Grocery and Sporting Goods,

01:16.163 --> 01:18.295
because we're a little bit
short in--

01:18.339 --> 01:19.731
Okay, you know what?

01:19.775 --> 01:21.733
I'm just gonna put these up
in the break room.

01:21.777 --> 01:23.605
- They're moving the whole
store to China?

01:23.648 --> 01:24.736
- Mm-hmm.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.526
- So Saint Louis
has this program

01:31.569 --> 01:33.571
where you can request
a free tree,

01:33.615 --> 01:36.400
you know to fight climate
change, and I figure we owe one.

01:36.444 --> 01:39.447
- Jonah, I cut down one tree
for Christmas purposes.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.623
- Well, I kind of already
ordered ten for the parking lot.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.320
We'll have to lose some spaces,

01:43.364 --> 01:45.105
but it'll encourage
public transportation.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.889
- Look, I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

01:46.932 --> 01:48.369
but this is just not the week

01:48.412 --> 01:49.500
for me to tear up
the parking lot--

01:49.544 --> 01:50.719
- You don't have to.
I'll do it.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.764
Or I'll find someone
with a machine.

01:52.808 --> 01:55.593
- Look, I know that the union
dying was really hard.

01:55.637 --> 01:58.161
- Not dying, just napping.
- Sure.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.815
A-and I'm really glad
that you're still looking

01:59.858 --> 02:01.425
for something to fight for,

02:01.469 --> 02:03.645
but in the last month there's
been the voter registration,

02:03.688 --> 02:06.082
and the bricks in the toilet
for the water conservation,

02:06.126 --> 02:07.605
and then that poor dog

02:07.649 --> 02:09.346
you rescued
from his own backyard.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.001
- That yard was a mess,
and he was skittish.

02:12.044 --> 02:15.178
- Yeah, because a stranger
was taking him from his home.

02:15.222 --> 02:16.832
- It's just--

02:16.875 --> 02:18.486
It's a lot.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.270
- Okay, all right, all right.
I get it.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.881
You're busy,
and I'm annoying.

02:22.925 --> 02:25.667
- No, no, that is not what I--

02:25.710 --> 02:28.626
But if you feel that way,
I mean, I support you stopping.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.193
- Hey, Rodriguez,
we have a problem.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.455
- I thought
I was gonna tell her.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.196
- It's my job to report issues
to the manager.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.242
Marcus came to me
with a problem with--

02:37.679 --> 02:39.333
Oh, you're gonna laugh,
but I've forgotten what it was.

02:39.376 --> 02:41.378
- Oh, come on.
We're low on produce.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.250
Our distro guy said we haven't
re-upped our contr--

02:43.293 --> 02:44.207
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.687
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.732
So no new contracts until
the acquisition is finalized,

02:47.776 --> 02:49.169
which means no produce
deliveries,

02:49.212 --> 02:52.389
so today we are skewing
a little husky.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.738
So we should be fine,

02:53.782 --> 02:55.697
but there is a chance
that we may have a problem

02:55.740 --> 02:57.220
when the weekend kale-heads
roll in.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.309
- Okay, fine, I'll figure out
who I'm supposed to call,

02:59.353 --> 03:00.310
and I'll call them.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.833
- A-and what do I tell my guys?

03:01.877 --> 03:03.661
With deliveries down, everyone's
worried about their jobs.

03:03.705 --> 03:06.708
- Just tell 'em
that nothing's gonna change.

03:06.751 --> 03:07.839
Probably.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.668
- Emphasize "probably."

03:10.712 --> 03:12.366
It's not reassuring,
but it is honest.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.671
- All right.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.630
- Garrett, do you mind
if I use your phone?

03:15.673 --> 03:16.979
My bus driver asked
to use mine,

03:17.022 --> 03:19.068
and then he put it in his pocket
and drove off.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.026
- Sure, yeah.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.377
Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you,
I got your wedding invitation,

03:23.420 --> 03:26.336
and the food options
are savory orsweet?

03:26.380 --> 03:29.034
I was kind of hoping to have one
followed by the other.

03:29.078 --> 03:31.211
- Anyway!

03:31.254 --> 03:33.038
It's 2020.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.475
Finally, right?

03:34.518 --> 03:36.346
- When did you mail out
invites?

03:36.390 --> 03:38.174
Mine hasn't arrived yet.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.610
- Oh, that's weird.

03:39.654 --> 03:42.222
You know the post office;
so slow.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.615
- Well,
I guess it doesn't matter.

03:44.659 --> 03:48.184
You already know
my RSVP is yes.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.142
- Yay.

03:50.186 --> 03:52.797
I didn't invite
Carol to the wedding.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.669
- Yeah, I was able
to piece that together.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.061
But I thought
you guys were cool?

03:56.105 --> 03:57.541
- No.
I mean--

03:57.585 --> 03:59.151
She's been helping me
with wedding stuff,

03:59.195 --> 04:00.718
but I'm still a little nervous.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.546
I walked in on her
in the bathroom yesterday,

04:02.590 --> 04:04.505
and she was practicing smiling.

04:04.548 --> 04:05.636
- Okay, you know what?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.290
You're making too big a deal
out of this.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.770
You just need to go up to her
and go,

04:08.813 --> 04:11.076
"Carol, you're not coming
to the wedding."

04:11.120 --> 04:12.948
- Wow, what a wordsmith.

04:12.991 --> 04:14.558
You should tell her
exactly like that.

04:14.602 --> 04:15.994
- Oh, me?
No, I'm not--

04:16.038 --> 04:17.387
- You're right.
It just makes sense

04:17.431 --> 04:18.736
since you're Jerry's best man.

04:18.780 --> 04:19.955
Thanks, Garrett.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.391
You don't have to get us
a wedding present.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.524
Telling Carol
is more than enough.

04:24.742 --> 04:27.005
- Oh, hey,
that's my phone.

04:27.963 --> 04:30.313
- Girl, you're looking hot.
- Oh, my God. I love this.

04:30.357 --> 04:32.446
- Slow day
at the Vision Center?

04:32.489 --> 04:34.404
- I'm avoiding Dan today.

04:34.448 --> 04:35.753
He just saw "Fight Club"

04:35.797 --> 04:38.495
so he's having a really dated
midlife crisis.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.063
- Wow.
Cool shirts.

04:41.106 --> 04:42.412
- I know, right?

04:42.456 --> 04:44.196
- Who knew Cloud 9
would ever catch up

04:44.240 --> 04:46.764
to intersectional feminism?

04:46.808 --> 04:49.289
- We'll look it up later.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

04:49.985 --> 04:52.117
- Although, I do wonder
if there's an opportunity here

04:52.161 --> 04:54.816
to--to kind of make more
of a statement out of this?

04:54.859 --> 04:56.426
Instead of just
makeup and phones,

04:56.470 --> 04:58.472
what if we gave them all
computers, you know?

04:58.515 --> 05:01.779
Or--or--or put them in, like,
a science lab, you know?

05:01.823 --> 05:04.304
You know, like,
Marie Curie and--

05:04.347 --> 05:06.567
I--her gang.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.308
- You want to give
mannequins jobs?

05:08.351 --> 05:10.614
Never forget how fun you are,
Jonah.

05:10.658 --> 05:13.748
- Look, everything is so hectic
with this acquisition,

05:13.791 --> 05:15.532
and I need a floor supervisor,

05:15.576 --> 05:17.926
and you are the obvious choice.

05:17.969 --> 05:21.190
- This is such an honor.
- Oh, God.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.713
- I'm getting emotional.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.933
I don't know if it's that music
that you're playing, but--

05:24.976 --> 05:26.543
- Oh, I'm just on hold
with Corporate

05:26.587 --> 05:28.371
trying to get more produce
into the store.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.851
- Oh, shouldn't be
a problem today.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.332
It's looking
really husky out there.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.116
- Right?
So husky.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.378
- I know.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.727
- Anyway, so you can start
right away?

05:36.771 --> 05:39.774
- Um, actually, I'm not sure.

05:39.817 --> 05:42.124
It's just that when I supervise,
I stress,

05:42.167 --> 05:43.604
when I stress,
I drink juice,

05:43.647 --> 05:45.780
and when I drink juice,
I develop Type 2 diabetes, so--

05:46.998 --> 05:49.349
Could I just think about it
for a little while?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.438
- Um, okay, yeah.

05:51.481 --> 05:54.354
Sure, take...some time.

05:54.397 --> 05:57.269
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.880
- It's funny 'cause Tuesday's
are usually the husky days.

05:58.923 --> 06:00.621
- I know.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.449
-  Thank you
for calling Cloud 9 Corporate.

06:02.492 --> 06:05.408
There are 97 callers
ahead of you.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.105
- Please continue to hold.

06:07.149 --> 06:10.761
- ♪ So don't delay, act now,
supplies are running out ♪

06:10.805 --> 06:14.809
♪ Allow if you're still alive,
six to eight years to arrive ♪

06:18.726 --> 06:20.380
- Good job on the display.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.903
- Oh, thanks.
Yeah.

06:21.946 --> 06:24.035
This one's doing
stem cell research.

06:24.079 --> 06:27.691
Which obviously doesn't matter,
but it matters.

06:27.735 --> 06:30.172
- Ah, it's great.
T-shirt activism.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.565
Anytime we cash in on a cause,

06:31.608 --> 06:33.654
it always means cha-ching,
cha-ching.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.438
That's a cash register.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.962
- Yeah, maybe
it's a little calculated,

06:38.006 --> 06:40.269
but it's--
it's promoting gender equality.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.749
That's--that's a good thing.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.665
- Well, let's take a look.
Yup, $12.99.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.232
The similar style in
the men's department: $7.99.

06:47.276 --> 06:50.322
- Well, the--glitter's probably
pretty expensive.

06:50.366 --> 06:53.108
- Oh, wake up, Jonah,
this is the pink tax in action.

06:53.151 --> 06:56.067
Women have to pay more
for clothes, razors, deodorant,

06:56.111 --> 06:58.635
I mean, that's why
I use dog shampoo.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.463
'Cause I know the truth.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.073
But I mean, this is great.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.161
We're gonna sell
a ton of these.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.120
You should be very proud
of yourself.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.774
- Yeah.

07:06.817 --> 07:09.167
- Whoa, mom, these are cool.
- No, they're not!

07:09.211 --> 07:11.082
We're taking advantage of you.

07:11.126 --> 07:12.432
Not...her.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.259
All--all girls.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.052
Whoa, man.

07:24.095 --> 07:26.141
Did you take all those
girly power shirts down?

07:26.184 --> 07:28.665
- Oh, yeah.
I-it was problematic.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.014
- Yeah, I know.

07:30.058 --> 07:32.408
Yeah, so much for
"nothing's gonna change," huh?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.541
That new girl CEO
isn't wasting much time.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.847
- I--I don't think
there's a connection.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.937
These--these had to be ordered
way before the acquisition.

07:39.981 --> 07:40.982
- Oh, yeah.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.070
Hey, could you direct me

07:42.113 --> 07:44.028
to the shirts
that say "boy boss"?

07:44.072 --> 07:46.988
- Would you want that shirt?

07:47.031 --> 07:49.120
- Yeah, zip that baby up
underneath the coveralls

07:49.164 --> 07:51.514
and feel secretly powerful
all day?

07:51.558 --> 07:54.996
My point is,
a lot of guys around here

07:55.039 --> 07:56.693
feel the same way we do
about this stuff.

07:56.737 --> 08:01.306
- We--we don't feel the same
about anything, really.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.438
- Hey, you don't
have to be ashamed.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.918
- I'm not.

08:03.961 --> 08:04.962
- You're fighting
the good fight.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.486
- Nope, different fight.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.662
Better fight.
- Same team.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.886
- It's not a wig.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.758
Even though we want it
to be a wig, that's pure Carol.

08:17.801 --> 08:21.109
- Oh, no, uh, actually,
I got roped in to telling Carol

08:21.152 --> 08:23.111
that she's not invited
to Sandra's wedding.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.156
- Of course she isn't.
She's still into Jerry.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.550
- You know, maybe breaking
the news to Carol

08:27.594 --> 08:29.117
is more of a maid of honor
kind of thing?

08:29.160 --> 08:31.119
- Sure, I'm great
at delivering bad news.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.643
I would've crushed it
as a doctor.

08:33.687 --> 08:34.862
It's terminal!

08:34.905 --> 08:35.950
See?

08:35.993 --> 08:38.518
Informational, professional,
brief.

08:38.561 --> 08:41.651
Hey, Carol, you're not invited
to Sandra's wedding!

08:42.739 --> 08:44.654
- I think it just
might be awkward,

08:44.698 --> 08:46.438
'cause of your history
with Jerry.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.005
- Oh, that.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.398
That's all in the past.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.879
Sandra and I are besties now.

08:51.922 --> 08:54.534
There's no way
I'm missing that wedding.

08:54.577 --> 08:55.709
I'd rather die.

08:59.364 --> 09:01.497
- Press pound and leave
a call back number,

09:01.541 --> 09:03.238
and we'll contact you soon.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.414
- Oh, will you?
Will you contact me soon?

09:05.457 --> 09:07.764
Liar.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.157
Oh, oh, Glenn, Glenn, Glenn!

09:09.200 --> 09:11.507
- Oh!
Amy.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.162
Amy Sosa,
sorry I didn't see you there.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.642
- Have you made a decision

09:15.685 --> 09:17.339
about the floor supervisor
thing?

09:17.382 --> 09:18.558
I mean, I don't mean
to pressure you,

09:18.601 --> 09:19.646
but I could really
use the help.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.473
I mean, I'm doing
all this floor work,

09:21.517 --> 09:23.214
and I'm trying to get through
to Corporate--

09:23.258 --> 09:26.174
- Well, yes,
I've made a decision.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.439
And my decision is...

09:30.482 --> 09:32.006
- What are you?
- Um--

09:32.049 --> 09:33.573
- Glenn, why are you--
- That I--

09:33.616 --> 09:36.271
That--
that I need until end of day!

09:38.099 --> 09:40.318
- Sure, take your time!

09:41.711 --> 09:43.321
- She didn't believe you?

09:43.365 --> 09:46.411
- Look, Sandra, I think maybe
she needs to hear it from you.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.718
Mostly 'cause,
we ain't gonna try again.

09:48.762 --> 09:50.154
- We're not.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.591
- It's fine.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.724
Carol can go to the wedding,
and Jerry and I won't go.

09:54.768 --> 09:57.379
We can have our own
secret wedding in our apartment

09:57.422 --> 09:59.033
and dance with our cat.

09:59.076 --> 10:03.472
- Or maybe there's a slightly
less depressing solution, like,

10:03.515 --> 10:06.388
we get her to do something else
that's better than your wedding.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.477
Like going to a movie.

10:08.520 --> 10:11.088
A really--
a really good movie.

10:11.132 --> 10:12.568
- Oh, come on, Garrett.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.049
It wouldn't have to be
that good.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.055
Oh, hey, guys.

10:21.098 --> 10:24.188
- Hey, I just had to show the
other guys what you were doing.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.583
- Oh, oh, Marcus,
I already told you, I--I--

10:27.627 --> 10:29.672
- Hey, you don't have to front.
Okay, Dan's cool.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.239
I mean, he gets it.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.023
He's got ducks all over
his tie, he's clearly not cool.

10:33.067 --> 10:36.244
- Well, they're mallards,
so not just ducks, but yeah.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.854
I get it.

10:37.898 --> 10:41.684
You're fighting back
because men are under attack.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.381
- By shirts?

10:43.425 --> 10:45.253
- Yeah,
I mean haven't you noticed

10:45.296 --> 10:46.776
that the entire
women's clothing section

10:46.820 --> 10:48.082
just keeps getting bigger?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.213
And now they got
these rad shirts

10:49.257 --> 10:51.085
that are only made for women?

10:51.128 --> 10:53.740
- And they put them right where
the Hawaiian shirts used to be.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.786
I was saving up for one.
I was gonna look so chill.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.746
- First the radio silence
from Corporate, and now this?

10:59.789 --> 11:02.574
It's obvious--the new CEO
is gonna clean house

11:02.618 --> 11:04.489
and only let women work here
from now on.

11:04.533 --> 11:07.492
- Well, that would be illegal.
- Exactly!

11:07.536 --> 11:09.364
That's why you have to do
something about it.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.148
- Women get enough
special treatment already.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.715
You ever been
in the ladies bathroom?

11:12.759 --> 11:14.848
There's no pee on the floor.
- None.

11:14.891 --> 11:17.198
- Okay, guys, settle down.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.722
I mean,
I get that the acquisition

11:19.766 --> 11:22.333
and the bathroom floor

11:22.377 --> 11:23.900
might have everybody
a little bit on edge,

11:23.944 --> 11:27.034
but I mean, everybody gets
that you guys matter.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.296
We're all good.

11:28.339 --> 11:31.691
- You're right.
Guys do matter.

11:37.784 --> 11:42.397
- Gotta say,
your new cause is unexpected.

11:42.440 --> 11:46.314
- Look, this was just kind of
a spiraling situation.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.750
- This one just says bacon.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.318
Is that their stance?
Bacon?

11:50.361 --> 11:52.712
- Yeah, they were really proud
of that one.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.152
- It wasn't why I was doing it,

11:58.195 --> 11:59.719
but I really tapped
into something here.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.025
These guys are really freaked
out about the acquisition.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.766
- Yeah,
everybody's freaked out.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.289
It's a freaky time.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.552
Just tell 'em to take it down
and get back to work.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.554
- But that'd kinda just be like
a Band-Aid, wouldn't it?

12:09.598 --> 12:10.904
- Yeah, Band-Aids heal things.

12:10.947 --> 12:11.948
Why does everybody
hate Band-Aids?

12:11.992 --> 12:13.776
- Things are going to bubble up

12:13.820 --> 12:15.473
if we don't actually
address the problem here.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.779
- Oh, God.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.781
- Maybe, instead,
we should make them feel

12:18.825 --> 12:19.869
like they're actually
being heard.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.479
Give them a voice, you know?

12:21.523 --> 12:23.917
Try and get to the root of
what's actually bothering them.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.788
- I gotta be honest,
that sounds awful.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.224
- What if I change their mind?
- Jonah.

12:27.268 --> 12:29.836
- Come on.
Give me a chance.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.621
Please, please,
give me a chance.

12:32.664 --> 12:34.797
Just one chance.
Amy.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.017
- Okay, fine,
I will call a meeting.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.801
- Yes!
Thank you so much.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.977
- Why are the Hawaiian shirts
out again?

12:41.021 --> 12:43.327
- Because it's my time, Amy.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.812
- Carol, so, um--

12:49.856 --> 12:51.814
I ended up buying these tickets

12:51.858 --> 12:54.817
to Whitney Houston's
hologram tour,

12:54.861 --> 12:57.820
but they're on
the same day as my wedding.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.300
Do you want 'em?

12:59.343 --> 13:00.475
- No, thanks.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.129
I liked Whitney as an actor,

13:02.172 --> 13:04.827
but as a singer,
not so much.

13:04.871 --> 13:08.526
- That's so lucky,
because this is a tour

13:08.570 --> 13:12.226
of her hologram just acting out
scenes from movies.

13:12.269 --> 13:15.838
Anyway, here,
I'll save you some cake.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.405
- Sandra,

13:17.448 --> 13:19.929
did Dina and Garrett
put you up to this?

13:19.973 --> 13:23.019
- Wh--what?
No.

13:23.063 --> 13:26.153
I mean, they might have--

13:26.196 --> 13:28.895
- They're trying
to control your wedding.

13:28.938 --> 13:31.462
They told me I'm not invited.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.769
Can you believe that?

13:33.813 --> 13:37.555
- Carol, this isn't easy
for me to say,

13:37.599 --> 13:39.340
but you're...

13:42.734 --> 13:44.562
Right.

13:44.606 --> 13:46.738
They probably tricked me.

13:46.782 --> 13:49.176
That's probably what happened.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.047
Yeah.

13:55.138 --> 13:58.402
- Okay, thank you everybody
for coming!

13:58.446 --> 14:00.230
It has recently come
to my attention

14:00.274 --> 14:02.624
that there are some men in
the store who have some issues

14:02.667 --> 14:04.060
you would like to discuss.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.366
- What do men
have to complain about?

14:05.409 --> 14:06.933
Their beauty standers
are way lower,

14:06.976 --> 14:08.282
their clothes are designed
for comfort,

14:08.325 --> 14:09.674
and they never had to watch
"Sex in the City."

14:09.718 --> 14:11.154
- That is a good point, Dina.

14:11.198 --> 14:14.114
It does sort of feel society
is set up by and for men,

14:14.157 --> 14:17.073
and that any complaint really
just sounds like whining--

14:17.117 --> 14:18.858
is what I hear Dina saying.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.033
- Yeah, okay,
hey, you know what?

14:20.076 --> 14:22.209
Why don't we set
some ground rules

14:22.252 --> 14:24.864
so that everyone feels
like they've got a safe space

14:24.907 --> 14:26.561
that they can--
- Nope, nope.

14:26.604 --> 14:29.042
I'm not saying squat in
anything called a "safe space."

14:29.085 --> 14:31.914
- What if we call it
"the Octagon."

14:31.958 --> 14:33.350
- Aw, hell yeah.
- There you go.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.526
- Yeah, yeah.
- What does that mean?

14:35.570 --> 14:37.441
- Yeah, whatever they wanna--
- Okay, yeah, fine.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.400
- Octagon.
- Welcome to the Octagon.

14:39.443 --> 14:40.444
- Welcome to the Octogan!

14:40.488 --> 14:42.098
- And just to be clear:

14:42.142 --> 14:44.492
you will not be judged
here in the Octagon.

14:44.535 --> 14:47.756
Right?
Just want to make sure I'm safe.

14:49.801 --> 14:53.109
- ♪ Just call me angel
of the morning ♪

14:53.153 --> 14:55.285
♪ Angel

14:55.329 --> 14:57.287
♪ Just touch my cheek

14:57.331 --> 14:58.506
- So I'm paying,

14:58.549 --> 15:00.725
and then my wife comes up
and tickles me

15:00.769 --> 15:02.292
right in front of my mechanic.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.208
And she knew
what she was doing.

15:05.252 --> 15:08.037
- Thank you, so much, Dan,
for sharing, um, but--

15:08.081 --> 15:10.431
perhaps going forward,
we could all focus on--

15:10.474 --> 15:13.260
on the issues that we have
here at--at work.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.609
- Well, it affects my work.

15:14.652 --> 15:17.742
- It does.
It really does.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.876
- Amy, do you
want to weigh in here?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.661
- No, I think it's okay for you
to run this one by yourself.

15:23.705 --> 15:25.228
- Okay, great.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.534
Great, great.

15:26.577 --> 15:29.145
Uh, gentlemen,
it sounds to me like, uh,

15:29.189 --> 15:30.799
a lot of these frustrations

15:30.842 --> 15:33.019
stem from a sense
of powerlessness.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.977
which historically,

15:35.021 --> 15:37.937
has been something that women
have had to deal contend with.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.200
- Yeah, but they're
not powerless anymore.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.637
I mean, Amy and Dina run
the frickin' store.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.334
And now the new CEO?

15:44.378 --> 15:47.337
All men have left
are the NFL and the country.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.904
- That's right!
- Yeah!

15:49.905 --> 15:51.080
- Guys, look,

15:51.124 --> 15:54.649
feminism can exist
without this feeling

15:54.692 --> 15:57.086
that something is being taken
away from you, you know?

15:57.130 --> 15:58.740
And--and--and honestly,

15:58.783 --> 16:01.221
if you listen to--
to what the women are saying--

16:01.264 --> 16:02.265
- What?

16:02.309 --> 16:04.572
What are the women saying,
Jonah?

16:04.615 --> 16:06.835
- Right, yes, yeah, yeah.
That's a good--

16:06.878 --> 16:08.532
that's a good point.

16:08.576 --> 16:11.361
I think we should probably hear
a few more, uh, female voices.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.798
- I'll give you a female voice.
My wife:

16:13.842 --> 16:16.018
"Do this, do that.
Ugh, I'm Donna!"

16:17.846 --> 16:19.979
-  I know I'm not
being a very good feminist

16:20.022 --> 16:23.765
right now, but I've met his
wife, and that was spot on.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.723
- Personally,
I'm not a feminist.

16:25.767 --> 16:26.898
- What?

16:26.942 --> 16:28.291
- Yeah, I just think
that men and women

16:28.335 --> 16:30.076
should be treated equally.

16:30.119 --> 16:33.122
- Yeah, Cheyenne,
that's what feminism means.

16:33.166 --> 16:36.125
- Oh, well, now I wish
I was a feminist.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.823
- Okay, I've heard
what you all are saying,

16:38.867 --> 16:42.566
um, but as a father
of a daughter--

16:42.610 --> 16:45.482
- Listen up, ladies,
father of a daughter talking.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.049
- Thank you.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.878
Of course I want the world
to be better for Rose,

16:49.921 --> 16:52.750
but I want it to stay
the same for me.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.404
Is that too much to ask?

16:54.448 --> 16:56.058
- That's all I want.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.060
- Yes, that's the problem.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.583
- Okay, okay, okay!

16:59.627 --> 17:01.933
This is great, this is healthy,
this is--this is--

17:01.977 --> 17:04.153
we're--we're dialoguing.
Okay.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.850
- Yeah, it feels kinda good.

17:05.894 --> 17:08.766
I mean, you know,
I know I say I'm mad,

17:08.810 --> 17:11.073
but the truth is,
I'm scared.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.640
I need this job.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.772
My wife would leave me
if I couldn't provide for her,

17:14.816 --> 17:16.383
and I don't blame her.

17:16.426 --> 17:17.906
- Yes, yes, yes,
this is store 1217.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.299
Ozark Highlands.

17:19.342 --> 17:22.258
- Oh, my God.
Are you on the phone?

17:22.302 --> 17:24.086
- Uh, just give me
one second, please.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.261
- Amy.

17:25.305 --> 17:26.741
- Yeah,
I've been on hold all day long,

17:26.784 --> 17:28.786
just trying to get an answer
to your question, actually.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.920
- This man has dumped his guts
out all over the floor,

17:31.963 --> 17:33.443
and you're on the phone.

17:33.487 --> 17:36.229
- Guys, she is not listening
to us.

17:36.272 --> 17:39.101
We need to make her listen!

17:42.278 --> 17:46.326
- ♪ We're not gonna take it,
no, we ain't gonna take it ♪

17:46.369 --> 17:47.936
♪ We're not gonna take it
anymore ♪

17:47.979 --> 17:50.895
- Hey, guys, I'm pretty sure
there are some sections

17:50.939 --> 17:53.289
in the store
that need covering.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.596
Hey, Marcus,
put some pants on.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.250
- I bet you wouldn't say that
if I was a woman

17:57.293 --> 17:58.251
wearing my underwear.

17:58.294 --> 18:00.122
- Uh, yeah I would.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.124
- Sorry, I meant, uh, a woman
wearing her own underwear.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.734
Like, "my underwear."

18:03.778 --> 18:06.085
Like, "I'm a woman,
wearing women's underwear."

18:06.128 --> 18:07.956
- Okay, just stop.
- No, you're making this weird.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.697
- No, you're making it weird.
- Just touch my underwear.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.874
- Okay, I know that this looks
bad, but I have an idea--

18:12.917 --> 18:14.267
- No.
- No, no, just hear me out--

18:14.310 --> 18:15.442
- No.
- I can--

18:15.485 --> 18:16.617
No!
No more.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.140
I have bent over backwards

18:18.184 --> 18:21.012
all day long
to make men feel comfortable.

18:21.056 --> 18:24.146
These guys, Glenn, you.
- Me?

18:24.190 --> 18:25.408
- Yes, you.

18:25.452 --> 18:28.629
Jonah, I wasted my afternoon
in that meeting

18:28.672 --> 18:30.935
just to go along
with your new cause,

18:30.979 --> 18:32.807
and I know you feel bad
about the union,

18:32.850 --> 18:34.504
and I'm sorry about that,

18:34.548 --> 18:36.506
but making men feel better
is not my job!

18:36.550 --> 18:38.117
- Okay, calm--

18:38.160 --> 18:42.338
up, you--come up
with the best ideas.

18:42.382 --> 18:44.297
- This ends now.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.127
- But first,
can you sneak me a burger?

18:48.170 --> 18:49.476
With cheese.

18:49.519 --> 18:51.565
- So I've been doing
some thinking,

18:51.608 --> 18:55.090
and I want Carol
to be my co-maid of honor.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.137
- And you're good with this?
- Uh-huh.

18:59.877 --> 19:01.401
- Why are you looking at Carol?

19:01.444 --> 19:03.446
- I'm not.
- You are.

19:03.490 --> 19:04.882
Do you not feel
your eyes moving?

19:04.926 --> 19:06.493
What's wrong with your head?

19:06.536 --> 19:08.277
- I'm good with this.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.759
- Oh, that's so sweet.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.936
I'm gonna make sure
this wedding is unforgettable.

19:16.677 --> 19:18.679
- Ah, it's not the worst idea.

19:18.722 --> 19:20.811
I mean, she's clearly
more invested than I am.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.857
- We can go now.
- Okay.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.294
- This way.
- Oh, this way.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.733
- Oh, nice to have you, man.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.170
Didn't think
you'd come on over.

19:31.213 --> 19:33.781
- Yeah, I had
a change of heart.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.087
I got tired of all the guff.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.699
- Okay, guys,
so enough's enough!

19:38.742 --> 19:39.874
Back to work!

19:39.917 --> 19:41.919
- Yeah, right.

19:41.963 --> 19:44.052
- Excuse me,
I don't work for you,

19:44.095 --> 19:46.924
and we don't have to listen
to women anymore, right?

19:46.968 --> 19:49.188
We could have a second glass
of wine with dinner if we want.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.885
- Yep.
- Yeah!

19:50.928 --> 19:53.888
- Wow, uh, anybody else?
Glenn, you--you look like you--

19:53.931 --> 19:55.585
were you about to say
something?

19:55.629 --> 19:57.239
- I wanna say something!

19:58.719 --> 20:01.591
Amy, us men of the store

20:01.635 --> 20:03.898
are tired of taking orders
from a woman.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.682
men: Yeah!
- He's right.

20:07.336 --> 20:10.905
- And I think it's time
that a man was in charge here.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.167
- Hell yeah it is!
men: Yeah!

20:12.211 --> 20:14.300
- Huh, you know,
that's a good point.

20:14.343 --> 20:18.173
You could finally make
a man floor supervisor.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.827
- Yeah, Amy,

20:19.870 --> 20:23.178
I insist that you make me
floor supervisor.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.616
It's high time that a man
was third in charge here.

20:26.660 --> 20:28.096
- I was floor supervisor.

20:28.139 --> 20:31.578
- Third in charge again,
as one was recently!

20:35.146 --> 20:36.496
- It's not enough.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.759
- It's something, besides
my legs are really cold.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.935
- Hey, guys,
I did get the shirt.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.937
- Yes, but I mean,
is this what everyone wanted?

20:42.980 --> 20:45.113
- My kid's in a play.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.463
- All right, fine, okay,
all right, fine, go ahead.

20:47.507 --> 20:49.639
- Okay, Amy.
We'll take it.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.774
- Okay, then I guess
from now on,

20:53.817 --> 20:56.429
you all answer to Glenn;
a man.

21:01.085 --> 21:02.609
- Who will report to me.

21:02.652 --> 21:03.740
It's a victory for men
everywhere.

21:03.784 --> 21:04.828
Now get back to work.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.352
- Good dialogue,

21:06.395 --> 21:08.223
I feel like we really moved
the needle today, guys.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.659
- Oh, my God, you guys,

21:09.703 --> 21:11.052
I've been reading
about feminism.

21:11.095 --> 21:14.795
Did you know that women
make less money than men?

21:14.838 --> 21:16.623
- Huh.
- Wow.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.320
- That is  up.
