00:17.640 --> 00:18.600
Vitals?

00:19.120 --> 00:21.040
Twenty-three at 50 bpm.

00:25.880 --> 00:27.160
Final incision.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.040
That's it.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.520
Both twins are stable.
Congratulations, Dr. Farrow.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.280
Congratulations.
Thanks.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.720
Pleasure to watch you.
You really pulled that back.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.440
- No, it was a team effort, really.
No, it's your name in lights.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.360
- Enjoy it.
- Thanks, mate.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.160
Hello, handsome.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.280
- Well done, darling.
I'm starving.

01:32.520 --> 01:34.440
Could have got a taxi.

01:35.040 --> 01:37.160
You wouldn't have got a kiss
from the driver.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.920
- You're not gonna get one now.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.240
Jay's coming up tomorrow too.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.400
Hmm.

01:44.400 --> 01:47.240
We might get a bit more out of him
about his latest.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.440
Sally said that she's someone older
but didn't... didn't say anything else.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.840
You know what Jay is like.

01:54.520 --> 01:58.480
What happened to the last one?
Portia? She's long gone.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.680
For God's sake,
what do you two talk about?

02:03.680 --> 02:06.520
Don't suppose there's anywhere
we could stop for a drink?

02:06.520 --> 02:08.160
- No!
- Please!

02:08.160 --> 02:09.080
No.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.520
- We have to get up to my dad's.
Okay.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.120
This weekend's about celebrating you,

02:15.960 --> 02:17.920
whether you like it or not.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.440
Getting out to the countryside
will do us all some good.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.960
Think Edward'll have
a bottle open?

02:33.960 --> 02:36.440
I doubt it.
He'll probably be asleep.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.640
You should try
to have a lie-in tomorrow.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.560
You've had an enormous few weeks.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.200
Morning, Jay.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.360
Morning, Gramps.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.280
Still driving that old banger?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.840
You saying I can have one
of those beauties you keep in the garage?

04:02.840 --> 04:05.400
No! Not if you're gonna
look after them like that.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.800
Well, you look shattered.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.440
- Morning, Mum.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.440
What she means is, you look like shit.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.480
Thank you, Sally.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.720
So, did you get any sleep at all
last night?

04:16.720 --> 04:18.080
I'm ignoring you.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.440
- Coffee on?
Not enough for you.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.400
Not enough? Wow.

04:22.400 --> 04:25.400
I'm not accepting any of this.
I need more details.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.840
When are we gonna meet her?

04:26.840 --> 04:29.240
There's no way
I'm exposing her to you lot.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.280
- I actually like her.
- Oh, you like her!

04:33.280 --> 04:35.280
Yes, I do. Bloody hell.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.720
- Then tell me her name.
- No!

04:37.720 --> 04:39.960
He's still pissed off
we scared the last one away.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.080
Turn this up. I want to hear it.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.840
<i>...operation was an unreserved success.</i>

04:44.840 --> 04:49.760
<i>Surgeon William Farrow expects the twins
to go on and live long and full lives.</i>

04:50.960 --> 04:53.080
<i>- Our reporter...</i>
There he is!

04:53.080 --> 04:55.120
Yes, all right. Yes.
- Morning.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.840
Oh, turn that off.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.760
Eggs for the man of the hour.
- No, thank you, Edward.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.040
The junior doctor group chat's
on fire.

05:02.040 --> 05:02.960
Thrilled for you.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.120
There you go.
- Hey!

05:05.120 --> 05:07.360
My wonderful, talented man.
- Morning, love.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.200
Wednesday's party will be,
uh, a good chance

05:11.200 --> 05:15.040
to bring you into the House of Commons
to discuss the advisory position.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.120
Don't remember agreeing to this, Edward.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.160
You should both come
to the press launch.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.160
Health tsar. It suits you.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.360
I'm gonna be in chambers.
I'll join you as soon as I can escape.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.240
- Sounds like I don't have much choice.
- Reap the rewards of your successes.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.080
A?

05:30.080 --> 05:32.800
A... A... A... A... A... Amy?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.280
No.
Anna?

05:34.280 --> 05:35.760
Shut up.

05:37.640 --> 05:39.160
Anna Barton!

05:39.880 --> 05:42.440
- What?
- Anna Barton. Jay's girlfriend.

05:42.440 --> 05:46.720
Anna Barton! Oh, I knew you'd break!

05:46.720 --> 05:50.920
You didn't stand a chance
against our own fucking Sherlock Holmes!

05:50.920 --> 05:52.680
- She wore me down.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.200
Thought you were made of sterner stuff.

05:55.200 --> 05:58.600
You can talk! As if you wanna go
to a drinks party in Parliament.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.480
He wore me down.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.120
- Health tsar? That's very nice.
- Yeah, hugely influential.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.720
- Mm-hmm. You'll be PM by next year.
- It doesn't quite work like that.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.680
That would be handy. You could fast track
my funding for the stem cell trials.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.920
That'll be my priority when I take power.

06:14.920 --> 06:16.640
- I should hope so.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.440
Thanks to Edward
for hosting us tonight,

06:19.440 --> 06:22.200
and a special thank you
to the clinicians here

06:22.200 --> 06:25.400
who are going to lead
our new approach on urgent care.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.400
Please make full use
of the well-stocked bars.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.840
- Thank you so much for coming, Mel.

06:34.840 --> 06:37.720
It's really appreciated.
What do you make of it? I...

06:51.160 --> 06:52.360
Hey, William. Uh...

06:52.880 --> 06:55.160
- Sorry?
What do you make of it?

06:56.600 --> 06:59.320
- Uh, excuse me, one moment.
Of course.

07:11.800 --> 07:12.640
Sir.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.720
Thank you.

07:31.240 --> 07:32.080
Hello.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.560
I'm Anna. I'm Anna Barton.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.200
I'm William Farrow.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.080
You're Jay's father.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.000
That's right.

07:47.840 --> 07:48.920
He's really proud of you.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.200
Well...

07:52.200 --> 07:55.400
...he's been pretty secretive about you.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.200
- Think he's worried about introducing us.
- Oh. Should he be?

08:07.800 --> 08:10.440
I've been hoping we'd meet
since he told me who you were.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.040
Oh?

08:15.840 --> 08:16.880
The operation.

08:19.160 --> 08:22.320
To separate the twins.
What an incredible achievement.

08:28.320 --> 08:29.480
How strange.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.320
Is that for me?

09:07.120 --> 09:09.200
- I'm going to go now.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.840
That's what I said to her.
I was like...

09:25.120 --> 09:29.440
You were supposed to wait until I arrived
before you lost control of your senses.

09:29.440 --> 09:32.960
- How much have you had to drink?
- No, I'm... I'm fine.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.480
I've had the day from hell,

09:34.480 --> 09:37.000
so I'm not fussed about staying
if you're not.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.720
I know
how much you hate these things.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.040
I'm fine.
Just had one drink too many.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.600
All right.
Hello.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.680
Where to?
Queen's Park, please.

10:00.160 --> 10:03.440
Apparently, Jay's new girlfriend
was supposed to be there tonight.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.680
You didn't happen
to bump into her, did you?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.960
Wouldn't know what she looked like.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.440
Jay. Jay.

10:53.800 --> 10:54.640
Will?

10:56.520 --> 10:57.520
Come to bed.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.760
I wasn't sure if I should wake you.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.640
I can categorically say

11:12.640 --> 11:15.400
that you can always,
always wake me for that.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.480
Okay, look.
- Mm-hmm?

11:26.720 --> 11:29.400
We've been seeing each other
for a few months now.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.480
Mm-hmm?

11:31.800 --> 11:32.640
And...

11:38.280 --> 11:40.920
I'm afraid I've come
to this really difficult conclusion

11:42.320 --> 11:43.160
that...

11:44.920 --> 11:46.920
I think it's time you meet my family.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.520
You bastard!

11:50.520 --> 11:51.440
This weekend?

11:51.440 --> 11:53.320
- If you think it's too soon--
- No.

11:54.720 --> 11:55.560
I'd like to.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.040
We should make it a lunch thing

12:16.040 --> 12:18.920
'cause Grandad,
he does a really good Sunday roast.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.080
Jay, it's me.

12:59.760 --> 13:00.720
Uh...

13:03.560 --> 13:05.040
Just call me back, okay?

13:40.480 --> 13:41.320
Hello.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.040
Hello. Who is this?

13:46.040 --> 13:47.080
<i>It's me.</i>

13:51.920 --> 13:54.600
I'm coming to lunch next Sunday.
I wanted you to know.

13:59.040 --> 13:59.880
Thank you.

14:04.120 --> 14:04.960
Goodbye.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.320
Anna,
it's so nice to meet you at last.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.200
Don't be too intense, Mum.
Don't be silly, Jay.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.280
We went with the lamb.

14:53.280 --> 14:57.720
I did ask Jay if you ate meat,
but he never replies to my texts.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.160
Thanks.
I love lamb.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.480
Oh, good. Where's my husband?

15:01.480 --> 15:03.400
Too rude to come and say hello.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.680
Why are you lurking up there? Come say hi.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.600
He's had a very busy week.
Um, Anna, this is William.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.200
Hello, William.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.200
Hello, Anna.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.160
Make sure she gets a drink.

15:17.160 --> 15:19.560
Jay, come with me.
You can help lay the table.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.400
You okay?
Yeah, fine.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.200
Hope Gramps hasn't burned it.
Don't be ridiculous.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.680
What would you like to drink?

15:29.480 --> 15:32.000
Hmm. What would you like me to drink?

15:54.720 --> 15:55.560
Dad?

16:00.640 --> 16:03.480
- You must be Anna. I'm Sally.
Hi.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.400
Come on, I'll show you around.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.160
Lovely house.

16:25.120 --> 16:29.560
- Anna, will you have some more wine?
- Yes. And the food was delicious, Ingrid.

16:29.560 --> 16:33.400
Well, you've Dad to thank
for that. I just peel the potatoes.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.840
With great precision!

16:34.840 --> 16:38.120
A surgeon and a barrister's
a recipe for late night takeaways

16:38.120 --> 16:40.000
and not much else, I'm afraid.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.600
You work at the Foreign Office?
Mm. Yes. Ben Collier's team.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.800
Oh, Ben. Bit of a reputation, I think.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.240
Oh. I know. Don't worry.
Nothing I can't handle.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.960
- So, Anna, where did you study?
I did politics at Leeds.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.040
Did you join the Civil Service
straight away?

16:54.040 --> 16:56.880
Mum! We can print you off her CV
if you like?

16:56.880 --> 16:59.240
- Sorry, Anna.
- Don't be.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.600
I hear we were at the same party
last week. What did you make of it?

17:03.600 --> 17:07.560
Oh. If I'm honest, I tend to try
and avoid those kind of work events.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.480
But in the end, I was glad I went.

17:11.720 --> 17:15.520
Oh, yes, Edward, it was a lovely party.
Thank you for inviting me along.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.560
Thank you.
- Well, I'm sorry I missed you.

17:20.320 --> 17:21.800
- You finished?
Mm.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.080
Anyway, um, much more thrillingly,

17:25.080 --> 17:27.640
Jay tells me
that you're planning a trip to Paris.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.480
Mm-hmm.
- Yes. A long weekend.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.440
Oh wow.

17:30.440 --> 17:33.440
- It's one of my favorite cities.
So romantic.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.080
Where shall I put these?
- Just here, thanks.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.240
Bye.
Bye, Anna.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.120
- There we go.
Hmm.

18:27.120 --> 18:30.400
She actually seemed quite nice.
- I thought she was charming.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.720
Yes. Very in control.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.280
She's so much older than him.

18:42.120 --> 18:43.320
That's not unusual.

18:45.840 --> 18:49.720
She gives me, I don't know,
this strange feeling.

18:50.760 --> 18:53.720
Don't worry. I doubt it'll last.
They never do with him, do they?

18:53.720 --> 18:55.760
Did you see how he was with her though?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.360
Maybe it's just sex.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.480
What are you looking like that for?

19:05.040 --> 19:07.000
Of course they're shagging.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.720
God, Will, you can't be that shocked.
Jay's had more women than--

19:11.720 --> 19:12.640
Than me.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.240
I should hope so.

19:17.880 --> 19:22.200
And aren't I the lucky one
that you stopped with me?

19:33.920 --> 19:35.680
- Good night.
- Night, love.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.000
- What a weekend.

19:56.000 --> 19:56.960
Yeah.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.320
Can you put the kettle on?
- Mm-hmm.

20:15.320 --> 20:19.200
<i>Paging Dr Gordon.
Dr Gordon, please report to reception.</i>

20:41.040 --> 20:42.120
You gonna get that?

20:52.480 --> 20:53.480
Hello?

20:55.680 --> 20:56.520
<i>It's me.</i>

20:59.840 --> 21:00.680
4:30.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.240
Send me your address.

21:40.960 --> 21:41.880
Stable.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.400
Checking your name's
still in the headlines?

22:08.760 --> 22:10.040
Is everything okay?

22:11.240 --> 22:12.680
Yeah, just family stuff.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.080
Right.

Hey.
Hey.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.920
- Sorry I kept you.
It's all right.

29:19.040 --> 29:19.960
Tough day?

29:19.960 --> 29:20.960
Awful.

29:23.000 --> 29:23.840
So?

29:25.320 --> 29:26.640
I presume this isn't just

29:26.640 --> 29:29.720
because you're desperate
for a drink with your old man.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.320
I'm all ears.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.680
Mum's not keen on Anna, is she?

29:42.320 --> 29:43.640
Why do you say that?

29:44.320 --> 29:45.160
Well,

29:46.440 --> 29:49.040
we're all so close,
and Anna's family isn't.

29:50.800 --> 29:53.000
I think she doesn't feel comfortable
with us yet.

29:55.120 --> 29:55.960
Ah.

29:56.480 --> 30:00.200
Maybe... she's just worried
that you're rushing into things.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.600
I'm sure Mum likes Anna.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.040
Do you?

30:09.960 --> 30:12.160
Doesn't really matter
what either of us think.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.000
Are you happy?

30:15.000 --> 30:16.480
Yes. I am.

30:17.480 --> 30:21.360
I feel this overwhelming need
to be with her...

30:21.360 --> 30:23.280
...all the time.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.200
Honestly, that is
the most important thing.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.880
I'd love
for you to get to know each other.
