WEBVTT

00:01.349 --> 00:03.525
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:03.568 --> 00:05.048
After 6 years
of being a vigilante,

00:05.092 --> 00:07.007
the only way to achieve my goal

00:07.050 --> 00:10.314
and save my city was to confess
to being the green arrow.

00:10.358 --> 00:14.492
Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.

00:14.536 --> 00:16.190
I am no longer a hero.

00:16.233 --> 00:20.672
I am inmate 4587.

00:20.716 --> 00:24.154
Previously on "arrow"...

00:24.198 --> 00:25.155
Hmm?

00:25.199 --> 00:26.461
Felicity, don't.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.506
We need him to help Oliver.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.118
I made a deal
with the feds, a trade...

00:31.161 --> 00:33.207
Diaz for your husband.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.686
Oliver's coming home?

00:34.730 --> 00:35.861
Why'd you kill dunbar?

00:35.905 --> 00:37.341
I didn't kill that guard.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.995
Your Blade says you did.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.127
Guards found prints on it.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.216
Turner, you're
going to the hole.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.870
W-wait. You got
the wrong guy.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.090
If you hadn't found
Turner's Blade,

00:47.134 --> 00:48.309
it would have been
all over for me.

00:48.352 --> 00:50.485
You were in the hole, Stanley,

00:50.528 --> 00:54.663
so how'd you know
it was Turner's Blade?

00:54.706 --> 00:57.231
I guess I must have
heard it somewhere.

01:19.166 --> 01:22.865
Good morning, 4587.

01:22.908 --> 01:26.086
A beautiful day.

01:26.129 --> 01:27.739
Be ready for an escort

01:27.783 --> 01:30.916
to receiving and
releasing in 6 hours.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.570
As of this afternoon,

01:32.614 --> 01:34.964
you will be a pain
in someone else's ass.

02:07.388 --> 02:10.651
Did you know Queen's
getting out of here today?

02:10.695 --> 02:12.697
I did, actually.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.527
He told me...

02:18.399 --> 02:21.837
When I told him how
much I was gonna pay.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.627
Get me a change of clothes.

02:29.671 --> 02:33.196
Get rid of them.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.503
I got a score to settle.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.506
I can't believe it.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.334
You're gonna get out of here,

02:40.377 --> 02:43.685
be able to eat real food,
not this crap.

02:43.728 --> 02:46.209
I'm really happy for you, man.

02:46.253 --> 02:47.863
I mean, I'm gonna miss you,

02:47.906 --> 02:49.212
but the green arrow

02:49.256 --> 02:51.388
never should've been
put behind bars.

02:51.432 --> 02:53.477
Remember when I told you

02:53.521 --> 02:55.653
that I was wrongfully accused?

02:55.697 --> 02:58.221
I was thinking maybe now
that you're getting out,

02:58.265 --> 03:00.745
you could ask your friend Laurel

03:00.789 --> 03:02.312
to help with my appeal, too.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.226
Stop.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.880
I know. It's a big ask,

03:04.923 --> 03:07.665
but, honestly, I don't know
how long I can survive

03:07.709 --> 03:09.189
in here without you.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.931
Stanley, I'm not
gonna help you, ok,

03:12.975 --> 03:15.673
because in here is

03:15.717 --> 03:17.414
exactly where you belong.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.721
What are you talking about?

03:19.764 --> 03:24.247
You killed dunbar, and
then you manipulated me

03:24.291 --> 03:26.554
into blaming Turner for it.

03:26.597 --> 03:28.077
What are you talking about?

03:28.120 --> 03:30.384
Oliver, we're, like,
best friends.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.299
We were never friends.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.566
I was just doing what
the green arrow always does

03:38.609 --> 03:40.089
to bad guys.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.612
I don't kill innocent people.

03:41.656 --> 03:42.918
But you hurt them.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.094
Remember what you did to yorke?

03:45.137 --> 03:48.010
To those other guards
to get sent to level 2?

03:51.753 --> 03:53.450
Prison changes people.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.409
It didn't change me.

03:55.452 --> 04:01.937
When I get out of here,
I promise you...

04:01.980 --> 04:03.460
You will face justice

04:03.504 --> 04:05.114
for what you did.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.768
If you do that,

04:06.811 --> 04:09.379
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life in here.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.815
I know.

04:12.948 --> 04:15.167
That's what you deserve.

04:15.211 --> 04:17.474
Don't do this.
Don't do this to me.

04:35.536 --> 04:38.190
I heard the news...
early release.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.757
You're a lucky boy.

04:39.801 --> 04:43.805
Too bad Turner wasn't so lucky.

04:43.848 --> 04:46.982
You know, after today,

04:47.025 --> 04:50.290
you're never gonna see
my face again.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.639
Tossers like you

04:51.682 --> 04:53.771
don't stay on
the outside for long.

04:53.815 --> 04:56.513
Wouldn't be surprised if you
was back here pretty soon.

04:57.906 --> 05:00.300
This ain't good-bye, Queen.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.653
Turner.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.874
You have a death wish
or something?

05:11.398 --> 05:13.269
I'm gonna find my way
out of here.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.751
And when I do,
I'm coming for you.

05:16.794 --> 05:19.928
I know that you didn't
kill officer dunbar.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.235
I made a mistake,

05:23.279 --> 05:24.846
and I'm sorry.

05:24.889 --> 05:27.370
What the hell do I care
if you're sorry?

05:27.414 --> 05:30.068
I'm getting released.

05:30.112 --> 05:32.375
I'm gonna make this
right for you.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.377
Of course you're
getting out today.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.074
I'm gonna speak with
Lyla Michaels

05:36.118 --> 05:37.075
at a.R.G.U.S.,

05:37.119 --> 05:41.428
and I'll just see if we

05:41.471 --> 05:43.386
can make some kind of deal, ok?

05:43.430 --> 05:46.084
Yeah, I know how much
promises are worth

05:46.128 --> 05:48.391
to people like you,
especially when you

05:48.435 --> 05:49.958
make them to people like me.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.699
That's not true.

05:51.742 --> 05:54.266
Yeah. You think
I'm a criminal...

05:54.310 --> 05:56.878
you said it yourself...

05:56.921 --> 05:58.445
and criminals
belong behind bars.

05:58.488 --> 06:01.099
Isn't that right?

06:01.143 --> 06:05.277
I think that years ago,
you saved Lyla's life.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.628
Now, I don't know

06:07.671 --> 06:09.586
if you can be that kind
of hero again...

06:11.806 --> 06:14.330
But I think you deserve
the chance to try.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.943
I have to go.

06:18.987 --> 06:21.424
I'm gonna make this right.

06:46.014 --> 06:48.669
Get up, 4587.

06:48.712 --> 06:51.889
You got a visitor.

07:13.215 --> 07:15.173
Hello, Oliver.

07:39.241 --> 07:40.547
Huh.

07:43.027 --> 07:44.986
I see that prison life

07:45.029 --> 07:47.162
hasn't been treating
you so well.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.555
You listen to me very carefully.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.731
I don't think you're
in the place

07:50.774 --> 07:52.472
to be giving demands
right now...

07:57.433 --> 07:59.217
Not unless you want

07:59.261 --> 08:01.089
a whole bunch of
innocent people to die.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.181
When I heard that...

08:06.224 --> 08:09.750
You were getting released today,

08:09.793 --> 08:14.015
it felt as if...

08:14.058 --> 08:19.586
My last chance at payback

08:19.629 --> 08:21.588
was getting away.

08:23.111 --> 08:25.069
And I couldn't have that.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.115
So that's your play?

08:28.638 --> 08:31.380
You're gonna come after
me in a federal prison?

08:31.423 --> 08:32.642
Mm-hmm.

08:35.905 --> 08:39.431
See, I've been in and out
of places like this

08:39.475 --> 08:41.650
my whole life.

08:41.695 --> 08:46.656
I know how to handle
guards like that.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.615
Now, you, brother...

08:50.573 --> 08:52.923
They don't see you as
green arrow in here.

08:52.967 --> 08:57.624
You're just a number.

08:57.667 --> 09:01.236
It's pretty dehumanizing,
isn't it?

09:03.499 --> 09:05.327
Bet you weren't
thinking about that

09:05.370 --> 09:08.112
when you were locking
these people up in here.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.853
Well...

09:11.376 --> 09:14.641
I'm not gonna do that to you.

09:18.383 --> 09:21.169
I'm gonna end you.

09:21.212 --> 09:24.041
You're going to die today.

09:27.828 --> 09:30.918
And I'm gonna be the one
who's gonna do it.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.576
But before that...

09:36.619 --> 09:40.536
I'm gonna make you suffer...

09:40.580 --> 09:44.671
The way you made me suffer.

09:44.714 --> 09:46.673
And when I'm done with you,

09:46.716 --> 09:50.372
oh, I'm just gonna, you know,

09:50.415 --> 09:55.072
pay a little visit
to Felicity...

09:55.116 --> 09:57.858
Yeah...

09:57.901 --> 10:00.861
And little William.

10:02.906 --> 10:06.388
And I'm gonna make sure

10:06.431 --> 10:10.044
that this time,

10:10.087 --> 10:13.482
I finish the job.

10:16.920 --> 10:20.054
Hey! Get in there!
Get in there now!

10:20.097 --> 10:22.665
Hey! Let me go!

10:22.709 --> 10:24.580
That's Ricardo Diaz...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.190
Get over there!
Get him! Pickup!

10:26.234 --> 10:27.931
That's Ricardo Diaz!

10:27.975 --> 10:30.064
Get over there.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.030
Hey, you,

10:40.074 --> 10:42.119
where do you think you're going?

11:00.094 --> 11:02.705
You're lucky we didn't
throw you in the hole,

11:02.749 --> 11:04.315
inmate.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.448
I don't care if this
is your last day.

11:06.491 --> 11:07.928
As long as you are in here,

11:07.971 --> 11:09.973
you will still follow the rules.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.453
You don't understand.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.977
That was Ricardo Diaz.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.240
He is here inside the prison.

11:16.284 --> 11:18.547
You need to let me
help you stop him.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.943
Slabside is a level 4
supermax facility.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.640
That doesn't matter.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.076
We have 50 officers on duty,

11:26.120 --> 11:27.948
each one of them
a trained professional.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.819
Trust me.
We have it covered.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.995
Trust me.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.302
That is not gonna be
enough against him.

11:34.345 --> 11:37.653
You only have a few hours
left in here, inmate.

11:37.697 --> 11:41.178
I suggest you stay
quiet until then.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.008
Diaz is here?

11:45.052 --> 11:49.012
Oliver, please talk to me.
What are we gonna do?

12:06.856 --> 12:09.163
I know you're still mad
about the dunbar thing,

12:09.206 --> 12:11.339
but this is Diaz.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.864
I mean, everyone deserves
a second chance, right?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.765
Oh, my god. You're
"shawshanking" out of here.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.249
Oliver, you got to
take me with you.

12:52.293 --> 12:54.121
Stay out of this!

12:59.953 --> 13:02.912
4587, stand down.

13:02.956 --> 13:06.786
If you are not gonna call
for backup, then I will.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.224
Let me go.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.139
You don't want this.

13:14.706 --> 13:18.014
I said, stand down.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.345
Whoa.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.741
Kiss your
early release good-bye.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.664
Target's on the third floor.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.015
Initiate lockdown procedure now!

14:05.845 --> 14:07.281
Lockdown, level one...

14:07.324 --> 14:09.109
Secure perimeter door now!

14:09.152 --> 14:10.980
Lockdown, level one.

14:11.024 --> 14:13.287
Lockdown, level one.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.028
Lockdown, level one.

14:20.076 --> 14:23.863
Hey! Are we gonna
be here all day?

14:23.906 --> 14:25.995
You are gonna be
here as long as we say.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.692
You got that, inmate?

14:27.736 --> 14:29.346
Inmates!

14:31.261 --> 14:35.048
Look at yourselves.

14:35.091 --> 14:37.702
You're on your knees.

14:37.746 --> 14:41.402
You're cowering before
men who are weak...

14:43.099 --> 14:45.232
Men who are beneath you.

14:46.973 --> 14:49.236
I've been where you are.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.066
I know how it feels

14:53.109 --> 14:56.243
to be treated like an animal.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.987
You can only take that
for so long.

15:01.030 --> 15:04.251
Hey, why don't you zip it, pal?

15:07.776 --> 15:09.038
Hyah!

15:22.573 --> 15:24.271
Stand up!

15:26.795 --> 15:30.755
These guards,
they imprisoned you.

15:30.799 --> 15:32.583
Yeah.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.412
They disrespected you.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.110
Yeah!

15:37.153 --> 15:38.981
They taunted you.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.591
Yeah!

15:40.635 --> 15:42.985
You all want to make 'em pay?

15:43.029 --> 15:44.160
Yeah!

15:44.204 --> 15:46.858
You all want to make 'em pay?

15:46.902 --> 15:48.425
Yeah!

15:48.469 --> 15:49.992
Make 'em pay!

15:50.036 --> 15:52.125
Yeah!

15:59.306 --> 16:01.351
No sign of 4587.

16:22.416 --> 16:25.245
You made quite
the mess there, Queen.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.900
Taking out prison guards
doesn't seem

16:28.944 --> 16:31.686
a very green arrow thing to do.

16:31.729 --> 16:33.688
I guess this place
really has changed you.

16:33.731 --> 16:36.560
I don't have time for this.
Ricardo Diaz is here!

16:36.604 --> 16:39.694
And he will not think twice
about killing us all.

16:39.737 --> 16:42.044
No, he won't think
twice about killing you.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.133
You see, I just met him.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.395
He seems a reasonable chap.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.354
Of course you're working
for Diaz.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.399
No. I don't work
for anybody.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.227
You see, me and Sampson,

16:51.271 --> 16:53.882
we got our own
plans, as per usual,

16:53.925 --> 16:55.840
but I could always take

16:55.884 --> 16:58.234
a little time out
for a bit of fun.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.201
Aah!

17:32.660 --> 17:35.358
Ugh!

17:35.402 --> 17:36.925
Aah!

17:36.968 --> 17:40.102
Been waiting to do that
for a long time now.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.932
Bad move, Turner.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.116
Sampson...

17:54.160 --> 17:55.552
That was your femoral artery.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.250
You've got maybe 6 minutes

17:57.293 --> 17:59.034
before you bleed out.

18:05.258 --> 18:08.304
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

18:14.832 --> 18:16.573
You're not going after them?

18:16.617 --> 18:18.227
I've got better things to do.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.620
Thanks for your help.

18:19.663 --> 18:21.404
It doesn't mean I like you.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.840
Turner...

18:24.538 --> 18:26.453
How did you get out
of your cell?

18:26.496 --> 18:28.672
How did you get out of yours?

18:53.567 --> 18:56.178
What are you looking for?

18:56.222 --> 18:59.181
Ricardo Diaz broke
into the prison.

18:59.225 --> 19:01.531
People usually break out
of prison.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.188
He wants to kill me,

19:06.232 --> 19:09.322
and he will kill as
many people as he has to

19:09.365 --> 19:11.193
in order for that to happen.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.195
I thought I had a lot
of enemies.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.545
Don't have a signal.
Come on.

19:15.589 --> 19:19.070
Hello. Are you having
technical difficulties?

19:19.114 --> 19:20.942
It's a little, uh,

19:20.985 --> 19:23.901
little going away present
from the longbow hunters.

19:23.945 --> 19:27.209
They jammed the signal,
so no calls in and out.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.429
You are so predictable,
you know that?

19:29.472 --> 19:31.387
You're trying to make
a call for help?

19:31.431 --> 19:35.217
You're trying to save the day?

19:35.261 --> 19:37.393
Ohh.

19:39.134 --> 19:42.006
I have someone here that
wants to say hello to you.

19:43.617 --> 19:44.879
Go ahead.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.186
Don't do anything he
tells you to do.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.413
Try again.

19:59.676 --> 20:03.114
You have failed this city,
Oliver Queen.

20:03.158 --> 20:06.248
Diaz, that's enough.
Let him go!

20:06.292 --> 20:09.425
You speak
and people do as you say?

20:09.469 --> 20:11.732
That's how it goes?

20:11.775 --> 20:14.300
Doesn't matter if you're
right or wrong?

20:18.434 --> 20:20.219
Not this time.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.224
Not anymore.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.666
How's that feel?

20:35.538 --> 20:39.673
How's it feel, somebody
else playing god?

20:39.716 --> 20:41.936
This is between you and me,

20:41.979 --> 20:45.156
and no one else
needs to die, ok?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.681
Wrong!

20:47.724 --> 20:49.291
Wrong again.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.294
I want you to spend
the last hours

20:52.338 --> 20:56.298
of your pathetic life knowing

20:56.342 --> 20:59.301
that these men, they died...

20:59.345 --> 21:01.782
they died because of you.

21:01.825 --> 21:04.306
I'm coming for you.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.178
But will you make it
in time to save the guards?

21:07.222 --> 21:09.790
It was hard enough getting
through a few prisoners.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.705
I wonder what it's gonna be like

21:11.748 --> 21:15.839
going against the entire prison.

21:33.379 --> 21:34.858
Keep your head down.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.860
They're not gonna mess
with me. They know better.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.558
It's not about them.

21:38.601 --> 21:39.907
Diaz knew we were
in the locker room,

21:39.950 --> 21:41.691
which means he's watching us.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.084
There are only two rooms
with camera access.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.564
There's the main security room...

21:44.607 --> 21:46.522
no way he got in there.
It's too fortified.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.524
Then he's in the control
room in the mess hall.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.396
That's where we have to go.

21:50.439 --> 21:51.875
There's no "we."

21:51.919 --> 21:53.355
I saved your ass

21:53.399 --> 21:54.530
so you could get me
a deal with a.R.G.U.S.

21:54.574 --> 21:56.184
Doesn't mean we're
some kind of team.

21:56.227 --> 21:58.273
Did you hear Diaz?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.449
He's killing hostages.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.365
You said I was wrong about you?

22:03.409 --> 22:05.062
You said you've changed?

22:05.106 --> 22:06.586
Prove it.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.721
The only way to the mess hall is

22:11.765 --> 22:13.027
through the cell block.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.507
It'll be 10 times worse
in there.

22:14.550 --> 22:15.551
This place is already
a powder keg,

22:15.595 --> 22:17.248
and it's about to blow.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.555
It's the only way to
the mess hall.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.782
These inmates are
gonna kill them.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.793
And if we don't get out of
here, they may kill us,

22:39.836 --> 22:41.795
and, clearly, we'll never
make it to the mess hall.

22:41.838 --> 22:44.667
I'm not gonna let
innocent people die.

23:31.105 --> 23:32.628
Uh!

23:32.672 --> 23:35.370
Uh!

23:35.414 --> 23:37.241
Hyah!

23:37.285 --> 23:39.200
Uh!

24:01.091 --> 24:02.745
Come on.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.674
Thanks, Queen.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.459
Where are the rest
of the guards?

24:20.502 --> 24:22.286
A few of them made it
to the panic room.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.724
Some were taken to
the mess hall.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.290
Diaz set the inmates loose.

24:26.334 --> 24:29.076
He convinced them
to gather up the guards.

24:29.119 --> 24:33.297
Listen, a few of my buddies
have already died.

24:33.341 --> 24:37.519
It's like Diaz is
killing them for sport.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.435
How many inmates
in the mess hall?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.132
Last I heard, around 30.

24:42.176 --> 24:43.090
You good to walk?

24:43.133 --> 24:44.439
Yeah, I'm good.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.788
All right.

24:45.832 --> 24:47.094
Take them to the panic room,

24:47.137 --> 24:49.096
and I'll meet you at
the commissary.

24:49.139 --> 24:50.576
Not the time for a snack.

24:50.619 --> 24:52.273
If we're gonna fight our
way through 30 inmates,

24:52.316 --> 24:54.101
we're gonna need weapons.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.779
I really, really need
to talk to you.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.747
Oh, good.
You're awake.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.490
I'm sorry about the sedative.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.970
I was just trying
to get your attention.

25:37.013 --> 25:39.842
It's ok. I... i understand,
Stanley.

25:39.886 --> 25:40.843
I was just, um...

25:42.845 --> 25:45.761
busy trying to stop Diaz from
killing everyone in the prison,

25:45.805 --> 25:47.546
you know?

25:47.589 --> 25:51.637
So, honestly, Stanley, I
think I could use your help.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.160
Really?

25:53.203 --> 25:54.335
Yeah. Really.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.599
Just, why don't you untie me,

25:57.643 --> 26:02.473
and we'll make a plan
and you can be my sidekick?

26:02.517 --> 26:04.040
Ohh! Heh.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.173
Actually, I already have a plan.

26:07.435 --> 26:08.610
You know how to get out of here

26:08.654 --> 26:09.872
through the morgue, right?

26:09.916 --> 26:12.222
So why don't we
escape this place,

26:12.266 --> 26:13.833
you... you and me?

26:13.876 --> 26:17.401
Yeah, we could,
but what about Diaz, right?

26:17.445 --> 26:19.055
Who cares about Diaz?

26:19.099 --> 26:20.840
These people deserve whatever
he's gonna do to them.

26:20.883 --> 26:22.058
You know that.

26:22.102 --> 26:23.407
Yeah. I...

26:23.451 --> 26:25.584
I can't leave all
these people to die.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.334
You were gonna leave me.

26:40.468 --> 26:41.730
You were gonna abandon me

26:41.774 --> 26:43.602
to brick and Sampson,

26:43.645 --> 26:45.560
and I shouldn't even be in here.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.128
I did nothing wrong.

26:48.171 --> 26:49.999
Hey, come on.

26:53.437 --> 26:54.917
It was just because

26:54.961 --> 26:58.617
you were going to
attack me. Ok?

26:58.660 --> 26:59.922
Why would I attack you?

26:59.966 --> 27:02.229
Because you're the green arrow,

27:02.272 --> 27:03.709
and you fight bad guys,

27:03.752 --> 27:05.449
and you think I'm a bad guy.

27:05.493 --> 27:06.755
And you just think

27:06.799 --> 27:08.931
that I'm what everyone
says that I am.

27:08.975 --> 27:10.324
How could I?

27:10.367 --> 27:12.892
I don't... i don't know
what people say.

27:12.935 --> 27:15.111
That I'm a killer,

27:15.155 --> 27:18.114
that I'm a monster,

27:18.158 --> 27:21.117
that everything I did,
everything I did...

27:21.161 --> 27:22.902
that whole dunbar thing.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.947
It was just like
the dunbar thing. I...

27:24.991 --> 27:29.125
I didn't have a choice!
I didn't have a choice!

27:29.169 --> 27:31.345
And all those people
had it coming.

27:31.388 --> 27:33.956
You killed other people
before dunbar?

27:34.000 --> 27:36.959
Honestly, what you and I
do is not so different,

27:37.003 --> 27:38.308
right?

27:38.352 --> 27:44.314
So, like, we make
such a great team.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.099
So why don't we just
get out of here,

27:46.142 --> 27:47.491
maybe we could work
together again?

27:47.535 --> 27:50.016
Oh!

27:51.495 --> 27:53.193
Why'd you do that?

28:08.164 --> 28:09.731
What the hell took you so long?

28:09.775 --> 28:11.951
It's a long story.

28:11.994 --> 28:13.779
How are felton and Miller?

28:13.822 --> 28:15.868
They're safe.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.480
I can't believe

28:19.523 --> 28:21.830
I'm working with
the green arrow.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.790
You aren't.

28:24.833 --> 28:28.968
Hey, maybe... maybe prison
has changed me,

28:29.011 --> 28:30.839
compromised my
judgment of people.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.667
You sure that's a bad thing?

28:32.711 --> 28:34.582
Look...

28:37.019 --> 28:38.194
No offense.

28:38.238 --> 28:39.674
Ok.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.851
But the old green arrow,
he wasn't the best.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.897
He saw the world
in black and white,

28:44.940 --> 28:46.594
but now you... you know

28:46.637 --> 28:48.552
there's gray out there, too.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.469
Maybe that makes you
a better hero.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.912
And I know it's bad for you,

28:59.955 --> 29:01.740
but do you really think
you're gonna stop Diaz

29:01.783 --> 29:02.915
with a can of soda?

29:02.958 --> 29:05.656
We're about to find out.

29:51.528 --> 29:53.704
Are you planning some
kind of light show?

29:53.748 --> 29:55.706
Something like that.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.491
It's nice to know
someone hates Queen

29:57.534 --> 30:00.494
as much as I do.

30:00.537 --> 30:03.714
If it wasn't for him, I'd
still be running Star City.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.325
Yeah, me, too.

30:05.368 --> 30:08.719
He's a cockroach.
He refuses to die.

30:08.763 --> 30:11.200
Diaz!

30:21.558 --> 30:23.865
Look who decided to
come to my party.

30:23.909 --> 30:27.173
Let those guards go.

30:29.871 --> 30:32.482
I told you...

30:32.526 --> 30:37.879
The only thing I wanted was
to see you suffer...

30:39.750 --> 30:41.361
Before you die.

30:41.404 --> 30:45.147
You're not gonna get
what you want.

30:45.191 --> 30:46.279
No?

30:48.020 --> 30:50.544
Uh!

30:53.416 --> 30:57.203
Ooh. I've been
waiting to do that

30:57.246 --> 30:59.770
for a long time.

31:02.208 --> 31:04.384
You get your shots in
while you can

31:04.427 --> 31:06.777
because I'm gonna see to it

31:06.821 --> 31:09.389
that you spend
the rest of your life

31:09.432 --> 31:12.609
eating your meals
in a spot just like this.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.046
I promised myself

31:14.089 --> 31:15.786
I'm never gonna die in prison.

31:15.830 --> 31:18.441
And I'm gonna take you with me.

31:18.485 --> 31:20.487
Oh, you sure about that?

31:25.448 --> 31:27.798
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

31:50.647 --> 31:51.822
Queen!

32:11.494 --> 32:13.801
Queen!

32:13.844 --> 32:18.675
Calling for help won't save you!

32:21.896 --> 32:23.463
This place...

32:23.506 --> 32:25.856
Is gonna be ash

32:25.900 --> 32:29.904
long before anyone gets here.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.340
Come on.

33:14.383 --> 33:16.951
- Get up! Get up! Come on!
- Let's go. Go! Go! Go! Go!

33:16.995 --> 33:18.735
Get going.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.523
What the hell happened?

33:23.566 --> 33:25.090
Diaz has some sort of device.

33:25.133 --> 33:26.917
It must have triggered
an electrical fire.

33:26.961 --> 33:29.181
The whole place is gonna go up.

33:29.224 --> 33:31.096
You need to get them
to the secure courtyard.

33:31.139 --> 33:32.227
What about you?

33:32.271 --> 33:33.576
I'm going after Diaz.

33:33.620 --> 33:37.406
You'll need these.
No half-measures.

34:15.835 --> 34:17.141
Just the two of us?

34:25.541 --> 34:27.978
Aah! Uh! Uh!

34:36.552 --> 34:38.511
Hyah!

35:08.845 --> 35:11.848
I'm a lot stronger now.

35:20.944 --> 35:24.339
Uh! Ohh!

35:24.383 --> 35:27.995
Uh! Uh!

35:28.038 --> 35:31.041
Prison's made you weak.

35:48.407 --> 35:49.886
Come on.

35:49.930 --> 35:52.193
Come on.
Get up.

35:52.237 --> 35:55.283
Yeah. Yeah.

36:12.126 --> 36:14.955
You're not surviving this.

36:22.397 --> 36:27.097
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

36:28.969 --> 36:30.449
I guess what you
and Felicity have

36:30.492 --> 36:31.754
in common, huh?

36:31.798 --> 36:33.278
Don't you say her name.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.330
Felicity.

36:42.374 --> 36:46.987
Do you know she tried
to kill me?

36:47.030 --> 36:50.991
She put a gun right to my face.

36:51.034 --> 36:53.341
She was about to pull
the trigger.

36:53.385 --> 36:56.518
I don't believe you.
That's not her.

36:58.651 --> 37:00.522
It is now.

38:27.783 --> 38:30.308
Arrow's little sidekick.

38:30.351 --> 38:33.615
How did you find out
about this place, Dover?

38:35.356 --> 38:37.967
I could ask you
the same question.

38:40.492 --> 38:43.233
Well, the only way out
of this place is

38:43.277 --> 38:44.713
through the morgue.

38:44.757 --> 38:47.803
But you don't have to be dead.

39:00.512 --> 39:03.036
Actually, I think you do.

39:05.821 --> 39:08.302
You shouldn't have been
so mean to me.

39:38.027 --> 39:39.333
Turner...

39:48.037 --> 39:49.691
Thanks.

39:49.735 --> 39:51.214
For what?

39:51.258 --> 39:56.219
Without you, we
would all be dead.

41:42.369 --> 41:43.631
Greg, move your head!
