00:16.892 --> 00:17.893
Excuse me.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.687
Do you have any games that don't suck?

00:23.065 --> 00:24.066
Thank you.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.115
That game, that one doesn't suck.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.661
Midnight Justice Five: Corpse Pile?

00:35.744 --> 00:36.995
Yeah, it's Corpse Pile.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.832
Sounds like the name of a band
whose drummer even I wouldn't sleep with.

00:40.916 --> 00:41.917
Okay, tough critic.

00:42.334 --> 00:45.712
This one will be a challenge.
This might be for you.

00:45.796 --> 00:46.880
-No.
-No. Okay.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.091
-What about this?
-Amateur hour.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.884
-This?
-Disgusting.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.803
-This?
-Almost as bad as Corpse Pile.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.138
Do you even like video games?

00:55.222 --> 00:56.223
-Love them.
-You do?

00:56.807 --> 00:59.810
-Then what kind of game do you wanna play?
-I don't know. Something...

01:00.853 --> 01:02.980
-dark.
-Very off-brand.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.815
I contain multitudes.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.066
Okay.

01:07.192 --> 01:12.739
I don't know. I want something
bleak and hopeless, like real life.

01:13.365 --> 01:16.243
Do you know about
Dr. Robotnik and the Mean Bean Machine?

01:17.119 --> 01:18.120
This?

01:18.203 --> 01:21.957
Dr. Robotnik kidnaps the bean people
to suck the joy out of this world.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.084
I think that's pretty real.

01:24.168 --> 01:27.462
Would you consider yourself more
the doctor or a bean in this scenario?

01:27.546 --> 01:28.672
Me? I'd be the doctor.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.300
Not 'cause I'm an evil genius,
but because I'm a man.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.720
That was meant to be charming.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.515
So I guess that makes me
a joyless bean then.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.058
There are worse legumes.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.194
Pointless.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.655
Well, maybe the game
you wanna play doesn't exist.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.992
You ever considered making your own?

01:57.951 --> 01:59.411
-Yes.
-You have?

01:59.494 --> 02:00.495
Yeah.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.747
You said that really fast.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.124
I thought you were gonna be
kind of impressed and blown away

02:04.208 --> 02:05.459
by me even asking.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.585
I'm a video game producer.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.669
-No way.
-Yeah, for real.

02:07.753 --> 02:08.752
-You are?
-Yeah.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.506
I was saying that for real
'cause that's what I do.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.174
I produce video games.
We make video games.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.009
I got a couple games here actually.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.011
-You really have a game?
-What games have you produced?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.346
-What games do I have?
-Yeah.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.555
Have I ever heard of any?

02:18.931 --> 02:19.932
-Mine?
-Yeah.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.016
-I'm sure.
-Like what?

02:21.099 --> 02:22.893
I've been in the business for six years.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.186
What have you produced?

02:32.945 --> 02:33.946
What?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.865
-What have you produced?
-Games.

02:37.741 --> 02:38.825
What's your idea?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.370
-Tell me a game you've produced first.
-I don't want to.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.290
Corpse Pile.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.711
It's a better game than the title.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.588
And I didn't come up
with the title or the cover.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.423
-You really produced Corpse Pile?
-I really did.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.509
-I did not expect that--
-Man, you must feel fuckin' ashamed.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.177
Yeah. The start was bad.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.346
And then you tried to get me
to buy Corpse Pile.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.765
No. I tried to get you
to say it was a good game.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.935
And then I was gonna say
I'm a video game producer to impress you.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.689
-Well.
-Yeah.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.357
-Okay.
-Okay.

03:31.420 --> 03:35.174
So you roam through the different levels

03:35.257 --> 03:38.260
using your flashlight
to kill the monsters?

03:38.343 --> 03:41.221
Very close. You don't kill the monsters,
you just push them back.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.432
They're a metaphor for fear and mortality.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.768
Well, I'm confused.
How do you win the game then?

03:46.852 --> 03:48.937
That's the best part. There's no winning.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.316
Yeah. There's no evil boss.
There's no glorious ending.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.276
It's like actual life, you know.

03:54.359 --> 03:57.529
You're just surviving as long as you can.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.037
I'm gonna help you with this.

04:05.495 --> 04:10.250
This is the part of the pitch
where you appreciate our scrappy spirit,

04:10.334 --> 04:11.877
but you say, "Thanks, but no thanks."

04:11.960 --> 04:13.587
-It's not what he said.
-We know how this ends.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.214
-Don't--
-We've done this a thousand times.

04:15.297 --> 04:20.052
Well, admittedly the concept is a bit of
a departure from our current portfolio.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.515
We tend to produce
family-friendly platformers here.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.434
You may have heard of Kitten Bonsai.

04:27.518 --> 04:28.727
Classic. So fun.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.313
Or Rockin' Boppin' Chicken.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.523
Yeah. Great.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.775
So, what is this game called?

04:35.317 --> 04:36.527
Dark Quiet Death.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.365
-A working title?
-Yeah.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.699
Okay, look.

04:42.783 --> 04:46.119
Here's where we're at with it. We know
the DQD game is a little bit off-brand,

04:46.203 --> 04:48.080
but that's why my fiancÃ©e and I made it.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.040
There's nothing like it
in the marketplace.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.125
-And you say it's already completed?
-90%.

04:52.209 --> 04:55.128
We need funding for beta testing,
certification, but we're--

04:55.712 --> 04:57.130
If it's a hill, we're right at the top.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.801
Could you make it work
for, say, a $300,000 advance?

05:01.718 --> 05:02.719
Yes.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.099
What the heck. Let's do it.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.642
-Thank you for your time.
-Okay.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.520
I will have the team in Montreal get
in touch with you guys with final numbers.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.146
-What?
-Looking forward to working with you.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.440
-And also with you.
-Thank you. Thank you.

05:15.524 --> 05:16.775
-You're welcome.
-Thank you very much.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.403
-And the game doesn't have a winner.
-Thank you.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.745
-Be cool. Be cool.
-Be cool. Be cool.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.425
Nope.

05:46.138 --> 05:47.139
No.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.473
You can't win this one either.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.478
You're trash.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.049
As you can see,
there is plenty of natural light.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.927
-Very exciting.
-And with a few minor renovations,

06:25.886 --> 06:28.180
-you can build walls, make offices.
-Sure we can.

06:28.263 --> 06:31.350
What's the outlet situation?
'Cause we're gonna need the wattage.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.436
I'm not sure offhand, but I can check.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.772
I'll tell you why, Patricia.
We're a video game company.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.275
Yeah. We made the game
Dark Quiet Death, so...

06:41.235 --> 06:43.695
-Wow.
-Yeah. Not sure if you heard of it, but--

06:43.779 --> 06:45.364
I haven't, but it sounds great.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.116
We're doing the sequel right now
and that's why we need this space.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.244
-And a lot of space.
-Congratulations to you.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.912
-Thank you. Gimme a sec, okay?
-Great.

06:54.665 --> 06:55.874
I kinda love it.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.501
I feel at home. You?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.419
You a yeah?

07:00.212 --> 07:05.092
I think it feels too exposed.

07:05.175 --> 07:10.264
Beans, Montreal expects
a 45% sales bump for DQD 2.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.849
It's gotta be amazing.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.559
Well, I thought DQD 1 was amazing.

07:13.642 --> 07:14.726
DQD 1 is amazing,

07:14.810 --> 07:18.355
but now we have so much money
we can kinda do anything we want.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.148
And I think this space would help.

07:20.232 --> 07:24.236
I don't like thinking about our game
in terms of square footage.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.320
Neither do I.

07:25.988 --> 07:29.324
Okay. Picture this-- you and me in here

07:29.825 --> 07:32.995
toiling to bring
our bleak message of fatalism

07:33.078 --> 07:34.329
to all the little boys

07:34.413 --> 07:38.876
and all the little girls
suffering from unearned optimism.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.216
That's all I've ever wanted.

07:48.177 --> 07:49.803
I just don't see
how we can afford this place.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.180
That brings up the best part.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.723
I was saving this part.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.226
-Patricia!
-Yes. Here we go.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.437
-There you are.
-I'm coming. Yes.

07:58.812 --> 08:02.065
Do you mind telling my lovely wife
why this place is so inexpensive?

08:03.275 --> 08:04.401
Well, you know.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.821
The interest rates are so high
and that keeps the prices down.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.656
Patricia, you mind
cutting the shit a little bit?

08:10.782 --> 08:13.493
This is the old
Harrison & Sons Textiles building.

08:14.745 --> 08:15.746
Wait.

08:16.455 --> 08:21.335
Harrison & Sons Textiles as in
the Harrison & Sons sweatshop inferno?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.630
-That's the one.
-Well, it wasn't a sweatshop.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.673
And "inferno" is a very strong word.

08:26.757 --> 08:30.219
Isn't it true that there were 40 workers
who were burned to death

08:30.302 --> 08:32.638
-in this very room?
-Forty-two.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.389
That was a hundred years ago.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.517
And technically,
they died of smoke inhalation.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.183
Oh, my God. That's so much worse.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.520
Yeah, it's terrible.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.356
And isn't it also true
that in the last century

08:42.438 --> 08:45.651
almost every business
that's come here has failed?

08:45.734 --> 08:50.113
As if this place is-- What's the word
I'm looking for? Like it's cursed.

08:50.531 --> 08:51.573
"Cursed."

08:51.949 --> 08:53.534
And don't some people say that

08:53.617 --> 08:57.496
the specters of all these burned victims
roam these halls,

08:57.579 --> 08:59.456
-punishing people who try to come here?
-Wait, no--

08:59.540 --> 09:02.835
-This building is not haunted.
-We'll take it.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.419
We'll take it.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.879
Good news. We'll take it.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.300
That's great.
There's just a couple of things to sign.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.468
Already on it.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.765
Sorry.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.517
The building isn't technically yours yet--

09:18.600 --> 09:20.477
I wouldn't interrupt her
when she has the knife out.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.770
She gets a little jumpy.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.232
-You said something about paperwork?
-Yes, I did.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.817
I'm your guy. Let's get to signing.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.735
Come on, let's go have some fun.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.738
Fuck you.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.312
All right. Thank you, guys.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.525
All right. Cool. Here are the notes.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.035
-Love of my life.
-Look at this.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.829
The art department just sent up
new concept ideas for the monster design.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.332
But I think that we're still seeing
too much of the monsters.

10:23.415 --> 10:26.001
So, in later levels,
I wanna weaken the flashlight beams

10:26.084 --> 10:27.711
so it's like
the batteries are running low.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.795
To illustrate fatigue.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.214
-Exactly.
-I think it's great.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.298
Thank you.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.383
This is terrible.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.678
-I was sprucing the place up.
-Beans!

10:37.763 --> 10:38.764
This goes in here.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.892
And this is a very sweet gift
from Montreal. Okay?

10:42.309 --> 10:43.685
And this goes right here.

10:45.062 --> 10:48.440
It's a nice gift
because we sold so many units.

10:48.524 --> 10:53.612
Speaking of success, I just went
to a really wild meeting with Marketing.

10:53.695 --> 10:55.155
-They're vampires.
-Parasites.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.616
But some of the research they did,

10:57.950 --> 11:00.202
when you actually go over
all the analytics of everything--

11:00.285 --> 11:01.286
Like focus groups?

11:01.954 --> 11:04.164
Yeah, some of the focus groups they did,
but they actually--

11:04.248 --> 11:05.874
We agreed we weren't
gonna do any focus groups.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.627
And we're not doing focus groups.
They're doing focus groups.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.087
-'Cause they're imbeciles.
-Morons.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.172
But they came up with
some interesting stuff

11:12.548 --> 11:14.258
-that we don't have to take.
-Great.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.808
It's just, the thing that they kept
coming back to about our game--

11:22.891 --> 11:25.352
-They want to kill the monsters.
-They'd like to kill the monsters.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.563
Yes, of course.
That completely tracks for them.

11:27.646 --> 11:30.399
That's why you don't ask John Q. Meatbag
his opinion on things.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.150
And I agree.

11:33.193 --> 11:37.781
But Montreal thinks that would bring in
tons of new people to our game.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.868
Eluding the inevitable
is what our entire game is about.

11:40.951 --> 11:41.952
-Right?
-Right.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.038
So if you, all of a sudden,
can kill the monsters,

11:45.122 --> 11:47.124
that changes all of that.
That's not our game.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.752
If the monsters die,
our game also dies. Yes?

11:51.211 --> 11:55.591
But if we had the art department
make the monsters look like your mother,

11:56.300 --> 11:58.719
would you be okay with
a wholesale slaughter then?

11:59.136 --> 12:01.221
We both know there aren't
enough pixels in the world

12:01.305 --> 12:03.307
to capture a monster of that magnitude.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.391
So true.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.435
All I'm asking you to do...

12:08.604 --> 12:09.605
just take a look.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.065
That's it.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.157
At the inside.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.672
Fuckin' shit.

12:37.174 --> 12:38.175
Ass.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.935
Are you afraid of the dark?

12:49.394 --> 12:52.105
Maybe you should be.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.238
Get ready for Dark...

13:01.490 --> 13:02.491
Quiet...

13:03.700 --> 13:04.701
Death...

13:06.453 --> 13:07.454
2.

13:13.669 --> 13:14.795
Coming this Christmas.

13:22.261 --> 13:23.262
Okay.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.765
I mean, you can't accuse
Marketing of being subtle.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.685
What... was that?

13:29.768 --> 13:30.769
Yeah.

13:31.687 --> 13:37.150
I agreed to guns in the game that would
dissipate the monsters,

13:37.234 --> 13:39.570
not kill them. Right?

13:39.653 --> 13:41.363
Right. And that's still true for the game.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.740
Doc, did we just watch the same thing?

13:44.700 --> 13:48.537
Because to me, a monster's skullcap
blasting through a drop ceiling

13:48.912 --> 13:50.038
looks a lot like death.

13:50.122 --> 13:51.415
-Yeah, but--
-No. It looks permanent.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.499
You're dead right.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.043
But it's just for dramatic effect
to pull people to the game.

13:55.127 --> 13:57.171
That's all this is.
We gotta see this for what it is.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.797
-That's all it is.
-So we're lying?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.340
No. We're not lying.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.177
Our game is true. Marketing is lying.

14:03.260 --> 14:05.637
But it's just to pull people in.
I don't see anything wrong with that.

14:05.721 --> 14:08.348
That is a wonderfully
sagacious justification, Doc.

14:08.432 --> 14:09.933
I don't know what any of those words mean

14:10.017 --> 14:12.144
except for "wonderful,"
and I like that word.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.938
Beans, look at it this way, okay?

14:15.022 --> 14:18.192
That commercial aired last night
during The X-Files, right?

14:18.442 --> 14:21.528
Which means
there are 20 million new people

14:21.612 --> 14:23.780
who now know about our game
and might wanna buy it.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.200
What happens when they get
their grubby little mitts on our game

14:26.283 --> 14:29.745
and realize they can't Jackson Pollock
monster viscera all over the walls?

14:29.828 --> 14:31.455
-What then?
-Then we thank Video Hut

14:31.538 --> 14:34.958
for their aggressive no-return policy
and we count our money.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.586
Come on. This is okay.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.839
Mom and Dad are fighting.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.508
We are, but we still love ya.

14:42.591 --> 14:44.426
But if we break up, it is your fault.

14:45.219 --> 14:46.470
We're being charming.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.430
This is charming right now. Trust us.

14:49.473 --> 14:51.266
Okay, guys, okay.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.769
Right. Go ahead, Brandon.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.313
Okay. So the weapon wheel
was just so overcrowded

14:56.396 --> 14:59.024
that we were having a hard time
maintaining the flashlight slot.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.402
But we know it's integral to the game,
so we came up with this.

15:04.238 --> 15:07.199
Light still plays a role,
but it's in tandem with the weapons.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.283
That makes sense.

15:08.367 --> 15:09.368
Thank you, Tom.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.871
A laser sight isn't a flashlight.

15:13.372 --> 15:15.499
I know. We tried mounting
the flashlight on the rifle,

15:15.582 --> 15:19.336
but it was clunky and the new environments
have the game much better lit,

15:19.419 --> 15:22.130
so the flashlight's more of
a throwback than a necessity.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.215
That makes perfect sense.

15:23.298 --> 15:26.009
Yes, it does make perfect sense, Tom.
Thank you again for jumping in.

15:26.093 --> 15:29.221
I'm gonna explain to you what I already
explained to the art department.

15:29.304 --> 15:34.142
The game is called Dark Quiet Death, yes?

15:35.102 --> 15:38.397
The shotgun addition has already blown
a gaping wound in the "quiet."

15:38.480 --> 15:41.066
We are not going to
lose the "dark" as well.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.569
-We're all on the same page.
-Understood universally, right?

15:43.652 --> 15:44.653
-Right? Yes?
-Thank you.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.114
And I think that's represented here.

15:47.739 --> 15:48.740
Am I right?

15:48.824 --> 15:51.451
I think what they're saying
is the laser light implies darkness.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.453
Something either is dark or it is not.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.455
-What do you mean, "implies darkness"?
-I mean, if you--

15:55.539 --> 15:57.207
-Do you understand what "implies" means?
-I do.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.709
-What does it mean?
-"Implies" is actually--

15:58.792 --> 15:59.793
Shut the fuck up, Tom.

15:59.877 --> 16:01.587
I don't think you understand
what you're talking about.

16:01.670 --> 16:04.298
Darkness, it cannot be implied.
It either is or isn't. It's a constant.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.133
This guy did a lot of work.
He's doing good work.

16:06.216 --> 16:07.301
-No, I--
-There's room for nuance.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.552
-I agree.
-Thank you, Tom!

16:08.635 --> 16:10.220
It's the Tom Show, everyone.

16:10.304 --> 16:13.724
Thank God that the brand manager
thinks that there is room for nuance.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.517
Could you please show a little respect?

16:16.226 --> 16:19.396
-Please.
-My tone is implying respect for Tom.

16:19.938 --> 16:23.567
This seems like a larger discussion
that we need to make time for,

16:23.650 --> 16:26.904
so let's table it for now
and we'll jump back in tomorrow?

16:26.987 --> 16:27.988
-Okay? Thanks, guys.
-Sure.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.072
-Thank you, Brandon.
-Thank you.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.490
-Thanks, everybody.
-Thank you.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.995
And we're still on for that call tomorrow
morning at 9:00 a.m.? In my office.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.747
I don't think you should
speak to him like that

16:36.830 --> 16:38.373
-and you know it.
-What call?

16:40.626 --> 16:41.627
What call?

16:42.377 --> 16:43.462
Disney reached out.

16:46.965 --> 16:47.966
No.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.928
That wasn't a question.
It was a statement.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.680
You think this is a Disney product?
Are you out of your mind?

16:54.181 --> 16:56.892
I think it's worth taking the call
because it's Disney.

16:56.975 --> 16:58.018
But we know how it's gonna end.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.270
This isn't a children's musical.
It's Dark Quiet Death.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.480
Why am I having to repeat myself?

17:01.563 --> 17:03.941
I just said this in front of--
You of all people should know this.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.026
I know Tiffany Winters is interested
in playing the lead.

17:07.611 --> 17:08.654
Tiffany Winters?

17:14.952 --> 17:16.493
She's America's sweetheart.

17:16.828 --> 17:22.626
Bean! Look, we both know
that a DQD movie is inarguably insane.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.002
But it could bring millions
of people to our game.

17:25.087 --> 17:28.464
Doc, if you take your eye off the vision,
they will murder it. Do you understand?

17:28.549 --> 17:30.509
It's like the thing with the frog
in the pot of water.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.135
That he just keeps swimming away.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.180
He's oblivious to the fact
that he is being boiled to death.

17:35.264 --> 17:37.224
-We're not gonna let that happen--
-It has already happened.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.308
It hasn't.

17:38.392 --> 17:41.186
Yes, it has. Look at the amount of
concessions that we have made.

17:41.270 --> 17:43.897
Pretty soon there is gonna be nothing left
of my game worth saving.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.695
Is that what you think?
This is just your game?

17:49.778 --> 17:51.405
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the only one protecting it.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.489
You think this is your game.

17:52.573 --> 17:54.283
-Sometimes.
-Not our game. "Sometimes."

17:57.619 --> 18:02.749
I am really sorry that DQD didn't just
end up some little indie one-off. Okay?

18:03.125 --> 18:06.086
And I have not been happy about
every concession that we have had to make,

18:06.170 --> 18:09.506
but, admit it or not,
those concessions brought us people.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.341
And without those changes,

18:11.425 --> 18:15.762
this game would've died long before
it ever left your fucking dream journal.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.853
How many fucking times have I told you?
This means something to me!

18:25.230 --> 18:26.857
Stop putting flowers in it.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.163
You're right.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.418
If our game had been a baby...

18:47.878 --> 18:50.380
I probably would've
drowned it in the toilet at prom.

18:50.881 --> 18:53.467
Why do you have to be
so morbid all the time?

18:54.510 --> 18:56.011
I'm just sick of it.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.607
I didn't mean it like that.

19:27.543 --> 19:29.127
Well, that was really sweet.

19:31.588 --> 19:32.881
How off-brand of me.

19:45.269 --> 19:47.020
I'm sorry I said those mean things.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.194
You're not wrong.

19:59.408 --> 20:00.409
I know that.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.872
But this has all gotten
really big really fast.

20:04.955 --> 20:08.125
And I am constantly terrified
that we are going to lose

20:08.208 --> 20:11.670
the thing about our game
that makes it worth all of...

20:14.006 --> 20:15.007
all this.

20:17.301 --> 20:18.302
But we're not.

20:20.137 --> 20:23.390
They took the dark. They took the quiet.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.142
They'll never take the death.

20:27.019 --> 20:29.229
We will always have the death.

20:30.314 --> 20:32.316
You weird, morbid chick.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.405
Look, it is still you and me.

20:39.740 --> 20:43.869
Look, it's still you and me all the way
down at the bottom fighting everybody off.

20:43.952 --> 20:47.748
And it always has been,
and it always will be. Okay?

20:55.130 --> 20:57.257
I promise I'll try to be more open.

20:58.884 --> 21:01.261
I promise I'll try to raise
your little toilet baby

21:01.345 --> 21:02.971
as if it was my toilet baby.

21:09.561 --> 21:12.231
I have hated you since the day I met you.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.818
I'm counting the days
until you turn to dust.

21:39.967 --> 21:44.263
This summer, darkness will fall.

21:51.603 --> 21:56.900
But one warrior will not go quietly.

21:58.569 --> 21:59.486
Let...

22:00.445 --> 22:01.738
there...

22:02.281 --> 22:03.198
be...

22:10.581 --> 22:11.582
light.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.253
Tiffany Winters is...

22:18.297 --> 22:20.090
Ash Light.

22:23.719 --> 22:26.638
Dark Quiet Death, the movie.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.807
Lights out, baby.

22:34.438 --> 22:37.524
Coming soon. This film is not yet rated.
AOL keyword: "Dark Quiet Death."

22:39.443 --> 22:41.069
Tom, give me the good news.
What do you got?

22:41.153 --> 22:43.780
Good news is all I got, man.
The movie's a hit,

22:43.864 --> 22:46.283
the studio is thrilled,
they already green-lit the sequel.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.285
Oh, and the part
I know you care most about,

22:48.368 --> 22:51.079
game sales are up 35%.

22:51.163 --> 22:53.498
Holy shit. Are you kidding me?

22:53.582 --> 22:55.334
The guys in Montreal
are losing their minds, man.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.502
They are pushing

22:56.585 --> 22:59.671
for the next game to be released
along with the summer movie cycle.

22:59.755 --> 23:00.797
You gotta be kidding me.

23:00.881 --> 23:03.717
No, no. You don't mean this summer, right?
'Cause that would be crazy.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.803
It would be crazy to say "this summer."
And you're not a crazy person, Tom.

23:06.887 --> 23:09.431
You're getting way ahead of yourself, man.

23:09.806 --> 23:12.809
Look, the deal isn't going anywhere.

23:12.893 --> 23:15.229
We can hash all this out on Monday.

23:15.312 --> 23:17.439
Let's just take the win for now, okay?

23:17.523 --> 23:20.776
All right, I'm just not--
All right, you're right.

23:20.859 --> 23:21.985
It's been a crazy year,

23:22.069 --> 23:25.447
and I think the lady and I
have earned a little celebration.

23:25.531 --> 23:27.991
Damn right you did.
You two enjoy your trip.

23:28.075 --> 23:30.577
All right, my friend. I'll talk to you.

23:34.706 --> 23:35.707
Hey, girl.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.630
-We're a hit.
-We are. I knew we would be.

23:42.673 --> 23:44.550
-You excited?
-Yes!

23:45.717 --> 23:47.344
-Here we go.
-Let's go.

24:05.529 --> 24:07.447
All right, little buddy, that's enough.

24:07.531 --> 24:08.532
Let's go.

24:11.577 --> 24:12.870
Oh, Roscoe.

24:16.039 --> 24:17.499
Roscoe mad!

24:18.292 --> 24:21.003
-Tom, what are you laughing at?
-Roscoe mad.

24:21.086 --> 24:23.130
At Roscoe. Roscoe's funny, man.

24:23.213 --> 24:24.965
They named that thing "Roscoe"?

24:25.048 --> 24:26.466
Yeah, Montreal seems to think

24:26.550 --> 24:29.052
there's room to expand his role
in the DQD-verse.

24:30.012 --> 24:32.472
-That character?
-He tested through the roof, man.

24:32.556 --> 24:36.810
Did you tell them it's an insane idea?
'Cause it is. It's an insane idea.

24:36.894 --> 24:40.606
Because obviously DQD is not a kids' game.

24:40.689 --> 24:44.109
Well, that's not entirely true anymore.

24:44.193 --> 24:48.655
Since the movie, we've seen a significant
uptick in players eight and younger.

24:48.739 --> 24:51.408
Who lets their eight-year-old
play Dark Quiet Death?

24:51.491 --> 24:53.577
-I don't know, man.
-I'm not changing the game

24:53.660 --> 24:55.913
'cause people don't know how
to raise their shitty kids.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.081
I'm just not doing it.
Doesn't make any sense.

24:58.165 --> 24:59.499
I hear you.

25:00.375 --> 25:06.215
I hear you, but this is an opportunity
to reach a much wider audience.

25:06.298 --> 25:09.801
Tom, we moved 5.3 million units last year.

25:09.885 --> 25:11.678
I think we're moving
in the right direction.

25:11.762 --> 25:12.763
Look...

25:15.891 --> 25:17.434
All they want...

25:18.060 --> 25:22.189
is a final battle where the player
has the chance to beat the game.

25:22.272 --> 25:23.649
An end? They want an end?

25:23.732 --> 25:25.859
-An end they can win, yeah.
-We've discussed this.

25:25.943 --> 25:28.111
That's overcoming death.
It doesn't make any sense.

25:28.195 --> 25:30.113
Well, it's worth considering.

25:30.197 --> 25:33.242
We could be the biggest game in the world.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.577
Yes, that would be nice.

25:35.661 --> 25:38.705
But this isn't the way to do it.
It just doesn't work.

25:38.789 --> 25:39.831
All right.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.753
I want to get there too,
and we are gonna get there, okay, friend?

25:44.837 --> 25:46.338
But this isn't the way to do it.

25:46.421 --> 25:47.673
I don't agree.

25:48.382 --> 25:49.383
What?

25:52.302 --> 25:53.470
I don't agree, man.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.515
Well, then fuck you.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.058
What?

25:58.141 --> 26:01.353
Fuck you and your brand manager bullshit.

26:01.436 --> 26:02.479
Okay. Okay.

26:02.563 --> 26:04.898
Don't say "okay."
This is just like you guys.

26:04.982 --> 26:06.400
-What guys?
-You!

26:06.984 --> 26:09.069
Movie execs, Montreal,

26:09.653 --> 26:11.655
your focus groups,

26:11.738 --> 26:13.740
your quarterly portfolios, all of it.

26:13.824 --> 26:16.410
It's just enough, man. It's suffocating.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.496
You know, it's funny.

26:21.123 --> 26:24.334
You know what? My ex-wife was right.
She was right about something.

26:26.003 --> 26:28.922
It's like the frog in the pot, right?

26:29.590 --> 26:32.509
And you guys keep turning up the heat.

26:32.593 --> 26:37.097
And you keep turning it up
until I am boiled to death.

26:37.181 --> 26:39.433
I think you have your metaphor twisted.

26:40.017 --> 26:43.520
You're not the frog in that scenario,
you're the chef.

26:44.521 --> 26:45.731
Very good.

26:45.814 --> 26:49.526
It's really easy for you to
say something like that, right?

26:49.610 --> 26:53.197
It's really easy for you to say that
because you don't care like I care.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.408
Because it's not your game, it's my game.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.622
You're right, it's yours.

27:03.207 --> 27:06.168
And you can berate me all you want,
I'll sit here and I'll take it.

27:06.251 --> 27:07.794
'Cause at the end of the day,

27:07.878 --> 27:10.005
me, movie execs, the focus groups,

27:10.088 --> 27:13.050
the guys in Montreal,
we're all gonna do what you say, man.

27:13.509 --> 27:16.303
You know why? Because we always have.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.057
'Cause you're the boss, Michael.

27:45.874 --> 27:47.125
You're right.

27:50.003 --> 27:51.505
You're right, I am.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.342
And I won't corrupt it for another second.

27:57.052 --> 28:01.557
Death remains the beating heart
of this game,

28:01.640 --> 28:05.561
and I will be goddamned if I rip it up.

28:06.645 --> 28:07.813
It's enough.

28:09.022 --> 28:10.566
No final battle.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.527
No Muppet.

28:16.154 --> 28:19.741
It's either Roscoe or me.

28:25.289 --> 28:27.332
It's Roscoe!

28:27.416 --> 28:28.750
Roscoe!

28:28.834 --> 28:31.253
Hey, kids,
say hello to your new best friend.

28:31.336 --> 28:32.337
Awesome!

28:32.421 --> 28:34.882
And now you can have
the perfect Roscoe for any adventure.

28:34.965 --> 28:36.842
Deep Sea Roscoe, Safari Roscoe,

28:36.925 --> 28:38.218
Princess Roscoe,

28:38.302 --> 28:39.636
Arctic Attack Roscoe,

28:39.720 --> 28:41.388
Rappin' Roscoe with boom box.

28:41.471 --> 28:43.682
I'm Rappin' Roscoe
And I'm here to say

28:43.765 --> 28:45.976
I like to rap in a major way

28:46.059 --> 28:48.937
If you loved him on the screen,
you'll want him in your heart.

28:49.021 --> 28:50.397
Roscoe!

28:50.606 --> 28:53.066
Now available everywhere.

29:19.092 --> 29:20.427
My God.

29:25.641 --> 29:26.850
No escape.

29:31.647 --> 29:33.440
Just trash.

29:41.657 --> 29:43.784
I hate that snaggletooth shit.

29:45.035 --> 29:47.079
But he did pay for my veneers.

29:47.704 --> 29:48.705
So...

29:50.374 --> 29:52.918
Yes, I went with the full set
of wooden dentures.

29:53.418 --> 29:54.711
Oh, yeah?

29:54.795 --> 29:56.630
Well, that's just practical.

29:56.713 --> 29:59.675
And sustainable. I applaud that, actually.

30:03.011 --> 30:04.012
Hey, Bean.

30:05.347 --> 30:06.348
Hey, Doc.

30:07.975 --> 30:08.976
-Hey.
-Hi.

30:09.351 --> 30:11.061
How are ya?

30:19.236 --> 30:20.779
Can you believe all this garbage?

30:21.989 --> 30:23.448
Just all run-and-gun now.

30:23.532 --> 30:26.034
Well, I think there's
some good stuff, right, Beans?

30:26.118 --> 30:28.453
You got Blood Siren Seven:
Curse of the She-Wolf.

30:28.537 --> 30:29.538
Oh, Doc, come on.

30:29.621 --> 30:31.748
-Seems to be a layered think piece.
-Right.

30:32.332 --> 30:33.584
There's some other good stuff.

30:33.667 --> 30:37.045
I think we could-- There's something fun
with Barrel Ape Madness 3.

30:37.129 --> 30:39.173
No? You're not seeing this
the way I'm seeing this?

30:39.256 --> 30:40.257
Well, I mean, I--

30:40.340 --> 30:42.384
No, I see. I see.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.636
-Oh, you are seeing.
-Yeah, I know.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.388
-I wasn't seeing Barrel Ape Madness.
-Yeah.

30:46.471 --> 30:48.849
Please rest assured
this is a pile of shit.

30:49.516 --> 30:52.019
But it shuts my kids up, so...

30:53.020 --> 30:54.021
it's worth it.

31:03.363 --> 31:05.699
-I didn't even know you were married.
-Yeah.

31:07.910 --> 31:08.911
How many kids?

31:10.996 --> 31:12.664
Nineteen. How's Tiffany?

31:17.127 --> 31:18.253
-She's dead?
-No.

31:18.337 --> 31:19.463
-You killed her?
-No. She's--

31:19.546 --> 31:21.965
I thought it was gonna be the cocaine
that killed her, but, oh, my God.

31:22.049 --> 31:23.091
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

31:23.175 --> 31:25.093
I'm sorry, Doc, that's not--

31:25.761 --> 31:27.638
-I deserve this.
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?

31:27.721 --> 31:28.722
I'm fine.

31:30.015 --> 31:31.892
And, Beans, I'm the one that's sorry.

31:48.116 --> 31:49.117
You know,

31:49.993 --> 31:52.204
if you're not finding the game
you wanna play...

31:54.039 --> 31:55.791
maybe you should make it yourself.

31:56.375 --> 31:57.918
You know, I just might.

32:06.802 --> 32:08.637
It was really good to see you, Doc.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.763
-You're leaving?
-Yeah.

32:09.847 --> 32:10.848
-So soon?
-Yeah.

32:10.931 --> 32:12.474
We just started talking.

32:13.684 --> 32:15.185
Take care of yourself, okay?

32:15.894 --> 32:17.521
Okay, yeah. You too.

32:23.402 --> 32:24.403
Bye, Beans.

32:50.846 --> 32:52.181
Nine dollars.

33:30.719 --> 33:32.387
You should try this one.

33:32.471 --> 33:34.223
This was a really good game.

33:49.530 --> 33:53.242
In conclusion, yes,
there are many other MMOs out there,

33:53.325 --> 33:56.578
but this game will lay waste to them all.

34:00.332 --> 34:04.044
Mythic Quest will revolutionize the genre

34:05.003 --> 34:09.091
because this game has something
that no one else will:

34:13.011 --> 34:14.012
Me.

34:14.721 --> 34:16.556
And a bunch of other guys. Like this.
