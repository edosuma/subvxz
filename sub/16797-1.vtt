<i> This is a takeover,</i>

00:06.707 --> 00:08.841
The major described
a good orgasm

00:08.843 --> 00:11.577
<i> like a red comet</i>
<i> followed by a black abyss.</i>

00:11.579 --> 00:14.913
You were the nicest guy
I've met in a long time.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.148
Good night, everyone.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.883
Is Teddy showing signs
of dementia?

00:17.885 --> 00:22.021
JIM: <i> I really like</i>
<i> spending time with you.</i>

00:22.023 --> 00:24.423
You know, socially or not.

00:24.425 --> 00:28.160
You want to, you know,
like last time?

00:30.296 --> 00:32.765
Rosalie,
this is Rosalie.

00:32.767 --> 00:33.499
What?

00:33.501 --> 00:34.833
WALTER:
<i> Are you dating Moby-Dick?</i>

00:34.835 --> 00:37.069
It's just Moby, no Dick.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.771
And, yes, I am.
When did this happen?

00:38.773 --> 00:40.906
Walter, we're divorced.
It's none of your business.

00:40.908 --> 00:45.310
I wish I had your breasts.
Argh. (LAUGHS)

00:45.945 --> 00:47.413
Celia, Shelly.

00:47.415 --> 00:50.516
It's only 9:30
in the morning.

00:52.152 --> 00:55.020
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:05.932 --> 01:08.400
(GROANS)
Not so tight, Harry.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.536
It's a necktie,
not a noose.

01:10.538 --> 01:13.739
My brain needs oxygen.
It does, Major?

01:13.741 --> 01:16.575
Don't provoke me, Harry.
Yes, Major.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.545
I made the changes
to the Dalai Lama paternity
story, Walter.

01:19.547 --> 01:22.481
Thank you, Martin.
What have you done
to your hair?

01:22.483 --> 01:24.550
Oh, my girlfriend likes
a center part.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.717
She's in charge
of my look now.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.019
Here are the talking
points on the bombing.

01:27.021 --> 01:29.388
Thank you, Shelly.
Hmm, you smell good, Walter.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.956
I like when you
don't wear deodorant.

01:30.958 --> 01:35.227
I am wearing deodorant.
And I applied it.

01:36.496 --> 01:37.796
Jim, Celia, stop that.

01:37.798 --> 01:38.897
There's a lot
of strep throat about.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.900
Uh, you're right, Walter.
I don't know what
we were thinking.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.968
I'm so sorry, Walter.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.604
I wish Jim would let you
see other people.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.072
All I want
is one night a week.

01:47.074 --> 01:49.641
I'd go down on you
for hours.
Shelly!

01:49.643 --> 01:52.511
There's my number one team.
I love you, I love you.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.446
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.181
And I especially
love you.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.416
Mmm!
Oh!

01:57.418 --> 01:59.284
Bob, please.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.155
Rosalie,
Bob just struck me
on the ass again.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.057
Will you have
a word with him
about it?

02:05.059 --> 02:06.291
He says
it's for good luck.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.127
Ha!
STAGE MANAGER:
We're on in 10, Walter.

02:08.129 --> 02:11.597
Have a great show.
Thank you. (CLEARS THROAT)

02:11.599 --> 02:14.333
Mwah. Oh, shit.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.669
Five, four, three,

02:17.671 --> 02:20.172

Shit.

<i> Good evening.</i>
<i> Welcome to</i> Blunt Talk.

02:22.743 --> 02:26.578
<i> I am Walter Blunt</i>
<i> right here, right now.</i>

02:40.860 --> 02:41.493
Walter Blunt?

02:41.495 --> 02:44.963
What you doing
on the bus, man?
You got canceled?

02:44.965 --> 02:45.898
No, sir.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.134
Just trying to be
a responsible citizen.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.637
Our world is in peril.

02:53.072 --> 02:56.175
Right.
All right, okay.

02:57.043 --> 02:57.976
All done.

02:57.978 --> 03:01.513
I been thinking about
the nature of time, sir.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.015
Again, Harry?
Yes, sir.

03:03.017 --> 03:06.418
Our experience
of time is like
the knitting of a hat.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.121
Each pass of the needle
is a day in one's life

03:09.123 --> 03:12.257
and the finished hat
is an obituary.

03:12.259 --> 03:14.693
A summing up,
an accounting.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.229
An epigraph
and an epitaph.
It can't be.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.765
Cornelia!
Major?

03:19.767 --> 03:21.900
It's Cornelia.

03:22.602 --> 03:23.669
Cornelia!

03:23.671 --> 03:26.171
Stop the bus.
Stop the bus!

03:26.173 --> 03:27.873
I'm fucking Walter Blunt!

03:27.875 --> 03:30.008
(TIRES SCREECH)
Whoa.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.618
Major!

03:39.620 --> 03:40.919
Oh, my knitting!

03:40.921 --> 03:43.088
(CAMERA CLICKS)

03:46.693 --> 03:48.227
Oh!

04:01.074 --> 04:03.609
Major,
what's going on?

04:03.611 --> 04:04.977
I saw Cornelia, Harry.

04:04.979 --> 04:07.679
I'm sure of it.
Here in LA.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.550
What?
And now I've lost her.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.453
Again.

04:15.488 --> 04:17.189
Cornelia.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.493
I'm sorry, sir.

04:28.301 --> 04:34.072
"Then each soul
shall be paid what
it has earned."

04:37.844 --> 04:39.611
The end.

04:40.013 --> 04:43.348
Well, that finishes
the Koran, Major.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.916
Very good, Harry.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.818
Thank you.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.086
(SIGHS)

04:48.088 --> 04:50.422
The Koran,
the Bible,

04:50.424 --> 04:52.357
the Torah.

04:52.359 --> 04:55.327
My education
is nearly complete.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.762
Oh, what about Confucius?

04:56.764 --> 04:59.231
He's next
on the syllabus, sir.

04:59.932 --> 05:03.602
And each soul
shall be paid

05:03.604 --> 05:05.937
what it has earned.

05:06.939 --> 05:08.140
Your medicine, Major.

05:08.142 --> 05:09.541
Oh, no,
thank you, Harry.

05:09.543 --> 05:12.411
It doesn't feel right
to drink so soon

05:12.413 --> 05:14.513
after finishing
the Koran.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.281
Oh, yes, I...

05:16.283 --> 05:17.549
I see your point, sir.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.718
I keep thinking
about Cornelia.

05:19.720 --> 05:23.388
Could it have been her
or am I insane?

05:23.390 --> 05:24.723
You're not insane, sir.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.592
But perhaps when
it comes to Cornelia,

05:27.594 --> 05:31.063
there is still a touch
of lunacy inside you.

05:31.065 --> 05:34.299
So I think
it was an illusion.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.334
You're probably right.

05:35.336 --> 05:38.904
I'm forever looking out
of the corner of my eye
in crowds.

05:38.906 --> 05:42.474
"Is that her?
Is that her?"

05:43.576 --> 05:47.012
I will never love
like that again.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.716
Oh, fuck it, Harry.
Give me my medicine.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.984
Right away, sir.

05:58.891 --> 06:02.694
Is it my destiny
to die alone, Harry?

06:02.696 --> 06:05.797
Not as long
as I'm around, Major.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.902

can you come to bed?

I'm lonesome,
I'm blue, I'm horny.

06:16.075 --> 06:18.110
Right away, darling.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.850
Good night, Major.

<i> I had six polyps.</i>

That's Jim calling now.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.022
Um, yes, Jim?

07:37.657 --> 07:38.623
Just wanted to say

happy three-month
anniversary, Mommy.

Happy anniversary,
sweetheart.

But I've told you not
to call me Mommy at work.

What does he call you?
JIM: <i> Why?</i>

saying mami for years.

Not well.

Cornelia.

08:40.254 --> 08:40.852
Yes, sir.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.389
And I had a sinister dream
about Orson Welles.

08:44.391 --> 08:49.094
My subconscious, I'm afraid,
is polluted by anxiety.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.229
I'm sorry
to hear that, sir.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.297
Me, too.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.965
But I love
Orson Welles.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.500
I was in
<i> Touched By Evil.</i>

08:55.502 --> 08:57.969
You mean <i> Touch of Evil.</i>
<i> "Touched By."</i>

08:57.971 --> 09:00.906
It's an erotic
reimagining of the film.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.707
Ronnie directed.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.242
Naturally.

09:04.244 --> 09:07.412
Anyway, Orson
glowered at me

09:07.414 --> 09:08.713
as if I was a criminal,

09:08.715 --> 09:12.651
but I haven't done
anything wrong lately,
have I?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.553
The only thing
I can think of, sir,

09:14.555 --> 09:16.988
is that you've yet
to respond to Vivian

09:16.990 --> 09:19.324
and Moby's
wedding invitation.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.792
It was sent
over a month ago.

09:20.794 --> 09:26.131
I guess I'm putting it off
in the hope it's not true.

09:27.700 --> 09:30.001
What do they mean
by "come as yourself"?

09:30.003 --> 09:33.471
I mean,
how is that a guideline
for how to dress?

09:33.473 --> 09:36.741
It is open
to interpretation, sir.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.677
Moby.

09:38.679 --> 09:42.013
Well, maybe he'll make
her happy.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.716
I wonder if he's
an adequate lover.

09:44.718 --> 09:48.353
It's not something
I've considered, sir.

09:48.721 --> 09:49.854

seem meager.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.798
More NFL players
are dying ev...
Nope.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.600
Some professors at MIT
seem to be able

11:08.602 --> 11:10.869
to send text messages
with their minds.
No.

11:10.871 --> 11:16.074

with an app that helps with
premature ejaculation.

11:19.545 --> 11:21.413
Nope.
The royal family has...

11:21.415 --> 11:22.814
Jesus Christ, no!

11:22.816 --> 11:24.949
How about this, Walter?
Half a million Americans

11:24.951 --> 11:27.118
die of colon cancer every
year and these mortalities

11:27.120 --> 11:29.721
could be prevented with
routine colonoscopies.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.389
I haven't got the figures
for rectal cancer, but...

11:31.391 --> 11:33.258
How is colon cancer
better than HPV?

11:33.260 --> 11:35.460
I haven't finished yet.
Jim's mother has six polyps.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.963
It's hereditary,
so Jim will have
to have a colonoscopy

11:38.965 --> 11:42.100
and I say why not make it
into a live broadcast?

11:42.102 --> 11:43.768
What? Mommy.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.003
Mommy?
Oh.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.272
I like
the colonoscopy idea.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.841
Me, too.
But, Walter,
I... I don't want to.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.777
Jim, you're doing it.
This colonoscopy broadcast

11:52.779 --> 11:53.878
to millions
could save lives.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.216
Dr. Mendelson and Beth
are here for your cognitive
therapy, Major.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.417
Thank you, Harry.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.853
All of you,
there is something
you can do for me.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.655
There's a writer for
<i> The Guardian.</i>

12:03.657 --> 12:06.691
Cornelia White.
Find out if she's in LA.

12:06.693 --> 12:07.926
Any reason why, Walter?

12:07.928 --> 12:10.795
I thought
I saw her last night

12:10.797 --> 12:13.431
and 30 years ago

12:13.699 --> 12:16.101
I was madly
in love with her.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.870
Okay.
Now, tell me.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.506
Well, you see,
my love,

12:21.508 --> 12:23.608
these past two months
have been

12:23.610 --> 12:27.846
the happiest months
of my life.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.281
Oh, I've been
so happy, too.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.718
I want to be
with you always.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.687
I'm filing for divorce.

12:35.689 --> 12:36.688
Rafe is a mature boy.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.457
He will come to accept...
Walter, Walter, no.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.193
You've misunderstood
everything.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.229
What have
I misunderstood?

12:44.231 --> 12:47.365
I never wanted you
to leave your wife.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.201
Oh, God.

12:51.804 --> 12:53.404
I think

12:53.406 --> 12:55.874
I'd better leave

12:55.876 --> 12:57.575
right now.

12:58.911 --> 13:01.412
Walter, I'm so sorry.

13:01.514 --> 13:05.784
WALTER:
<i> And that was the last time</i>
<i> I ever saw her.</i>

13:05.918 --> 13:08.820
DR. MENDELSON:
I imagine that must have
hurt like hell, Walter.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.588
I went through something
similar in my own life

13:10.590 --> 13:13.825
and my liver failed
and I wasn't even drinking.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.960
Oh, yes, it hurt.

13:16.829 --> 13:18.797
A great deal.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.400
But now I remember
that time

13:22.402 --> 13:24.636
more like a movie I saw
than a life I lived.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.372
It's interesting.
In the few months that
we've been working together,

13:27.374 --> 13:31.109
I don't believe I've ever
heard you describe anything

13:31.111 --> 13:33.511
with quite that le...

13:34.113 --> 13:35.213
Oh, dear, Beth.

13:35.215 --> 13:38.183
Beth, are you all right?
What is it?

13:38.185 --> 13:40.185
I just thought
for a moment there that,

13:40.187 --> 13:41.553
that Beth had
stopped breathing,

13:41.555 --> 13:43.955
but as you can see, she's,
she's perfectly fine.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.791
So sorry.
No, it's just that we're
very much attached, you see?

13:46.793 --> 13:49.294
We've been together for,
for 18 years.

13:49.296 --> 13:53.364
Anyway, I tried my best
to forget her, but...

13:53.366 --> 13:58.102
Well, I'm afraid
that's all we have time
for today, Walter.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.205
But, uh, we'll be certain
and pick it up right here

14:00.207 --> 14:02.874
when we get together
next week.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.314
Great colonoscopy pitch,
Celia.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.149
Oh, thank you.
You got a second?

14:11.151 --> 14:14.419
Um, I am in the middle
of stretching, Rosalie.
My sciatica.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.688
Good, thank you.

14:16.690 --> 14:20.992
I just spoke to Teddy.
He's arrived in Montana.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.560
How did he sound?

14:22.562 --> 14:23.661
A bit confused.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.598
But his brother
is wonderful with him.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.268
They're gonna go
fishing every day
for months.

14:30.270 --> 14:33.638
Apparently it's good
for dementia.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.040
And how are you?
Are you okay?

14:36.042 --> 14:38.276
I think I'm okay.

14:38.278 --> 14:41.012
Do you want to go
drinking tonight?

14:41.014 --> 14:43.114
I know this piano bar.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.315
Sometimes I get up
and sing.

14:44.317 --> 14:48.353
Oh, I'd love to,
but it's French movie
night with Jim.

14:48.355 --> 14:48.786
Ah.

14:48.788 --> 14:51.856
Do you think it's strange
that he calls me Mommy?

14:51.858 --> 14:54.292
No, it's very male.

14:54.294 --> 14:58.363
Most men think it,
but he's got the guts
to say it.

14:59.198 --> 15:01.599
Do you call him Daddy?

15:01.767 --> 15:03.167
No...

15:03.802 --> 15:06.104
but I'd like to.

15:13.779 --> 15:14.746
That's better.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.948
Your hair
is very willful.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.182
I know.
I hate my hair.

15:18.184 --> 15:20.885
Try not to
use the word hate,
even about your hair.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.922
You're right.
Um, thanks for bringing
my lunch, Rosalie.

15:23.924 --> 15:27.425
Don't forget to over chew.
It helps with your digestion.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.560
See you tonight.

What are you doing?

15:39.973 --> 15:43.174
I'm checking for lumps.
I didn't like hearing
about those polyps.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.444
In my mind, I see them
dangling like stinky
grapes in her colon.

15:46.446 --> 15:51.382
Uh, but aren't you supposed
to do that with your arms
above your head?

15:51.384 --> 15:52.684
Like pulling
the breast taut?
Huh?

15:52.686 --> 15:56.955
Uh, Rosalie number two
has a plastic card in her
shower with the diagram.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.589
Oh, well, if you know
so much about it,

15:58.591 --> 16:00.391
can you check and see
if there's a lump?

16:00.393 --> 16:04.062
No. No, I can't touch
your breast.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.430
No, you're too competitive.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.333
Yes, you can.
You're like my brother.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.469
And he used to touch
my breasts all the time
when I was little.

16:11.471 --> 16:11.869
Really?

16:11.871 --> 16:15.073
Yes, that's what
happens in families.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.541
Okay, so put your arms

Yes, well, I thought
I'd get a drink, too.

20:59.058 --> 21:02.827
Get your courage up.
Uh, that's just what
I've been doing.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.495
Walter.

21:05.497 --> 21:06.764
Oh.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.065
Oh.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.237
You always were
very French.

21:18.477 --> 21:21.746

21:38.598 --> 21:42.667

we have a choice.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.101

21:44.103 --> 21:46.137

more like

21:46.139 --> 21:49.607
a <i> Mother and the Whore</i>
night, I think.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.309
But before we watch
a French movie,

21:51.311 --> 21:53.511
can we talk about
my colonoscopy?

21:53.513 --> 21:55.012
Of course.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.814
The thing is,

21:56.816 --> 21:59.317
I don't want to do it.

21:59.751 --> 22:00.818
But it's all set up.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.953
It's important for your
health and your career.

22:02.955 --> 22:08.025
And I think people
will think you're
quite heroic.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.094
They will?
Yeah.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.863
I already do.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.500
Um...

22:16.935 --> 22:18.736
Can I do my thing?

You're looking
very well, Walter.

gentle with you.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.829
You're as beautiful
as ever.

22:44.896 --> 22:46.197
That's sweet.

22:46.199 --> 22:49.500
Do you know
what I remember most
about those days?

22:49.502 --> 22:50.968
No, what do you
remember?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.703
When your dog
gave you fleas

22:52.705 --> 22:53.871
and your shins
were on fire

22:53.873 --> 22:58.075
and you scratched
until you got a staph
infection.

why are you in LA?

23:03.516 --> 23:04.648
What are you
working on?

23:04.650 --> 23:08.285
Let's not
talk about work.
It's so dreary.

23:08.487 --> 23:10.354

23:10.356 --> 23:14.191

so we can drink more?
