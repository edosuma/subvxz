00:02.068 --> 00:05.231
This will be my most exciting
lighting display ever.

00:05.338 --> 00:09.274
The guys at the power plant will be
working overtime for this bad boy, huh?

00:09.342 --> 00:12.709
You might want to read this flyer.
I found it in the mailbox.

00:12.812 --> 00:15.303
It's from
the lighting contest committee.

00:15.882 --> 00:19.181
"Because certain rooftop displays
have exceeded the bounds

00:19.252 --> 00:22.551
of prudent energy consumption
and good taste,

00:22.622 --> 00:25.955
this year's lighting contest
will be strictly regulated."

00:26.893 --> 00:29.054
They're pulling the plug on you, Dad.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.393
What makes you think
this has to do with me?

00:31.464 --> 00:35.924
It says right here, "To be referred to,
henceforth, as the Tim Taylor clause".

00:38.772 --> 00:42.037
This is bunk.
This is bunk. Come on!

00:42.108 --> 00:44.668
"Electricity is limited
to two 20-amp breakers."

00:44.778 --> 00:47.338
Who can work with that?
"No bulbs over 25 watts."

00:47.414 --> 00:48.642
Ha, ha!

00:49.516 --> 00:51.677
"Maximum height of elves, three feet."

00:51.785 --> 00:53.844
What kind of elf is three foot tall?

00:55.555 --> 00:57.113
This one's gonna kill you.

00:57.190 --> 01:01.149
"Nativity scenes may include only
characters mentioned in the Bible."

01:02.629 --> 01:05.188
Which means no more Three Stooges.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.230
Those were the Three Wise Men.

01:09.335 --> 01:12.429
Really? Then why were they poking
each other in the eye?

01:12.505 --> 01:15.167
To break up the trip.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.965 --> 02:13.660
What is that smell?

02:13.733 --> 02:15.860
I'm making us a special Christmas cake.

02:15.935 --> 02:19.598
It's really cool. It's got pineapple
and mangoes and papaya.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.175
It's a fruitcake.
Everybody hates fruitcake.

02:23.243 --> 02:27.407
I know that. This is not a fruitcake.
This is a Christmas cake with fruit.

02:30.049 --> 02:32.609
"Cake with fruit."
Reverse that.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.279
- "Fruitcake."
- Don't take it out on me

02:35.355 --> 02:39.121
just 'cause the neighborhood
put the kibosh on your lighting display.

02:39.225 --> 02:43.457
You say "ki-bosh,"
I say "pish-tosh".

02:44.931 --> 02:47.695
- I got Wilson to be my partner.
- To help you do the roof?

02:47.800 --> 02:50.291
No, no. He's gonna give me
two 20-amp circuits.

02:50.370 --> 02:53.737
He's not decorating his roof.
I get his allotment of electricity.

02:53.806 --> 02:54.966
I get more wattage.

02:55.041 --> 02:58.477
It means I can make elves
the size of Shaquille O'Neal.

02:59.345 --> 03:03.281
I can't believe Wilson would go along
with this after reading that flyer.

03:03.349 --> 03:04.714
I'm not sure he read it.

03:06.786 --> 03:10.313
- Where are the boys? I need help.
- Picking up Mom from the airport.

03:10.390 --> 03:15.259
Listen, um... when she gets here
I want you to be extra nice to her.

03:15.328 --> 03:18.297
Oh. Now you tell me.
I just short-sheeted her bed.

03:19.632 --> 03:23.796
No. You know, I want this
to be a really great holiday for her.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.636
It's the first one since Dad died,
and she's bound to be depressed.

03:27.740 --> 03:31.506
If anything will lift her spirits,
it will be the new lighting display.

03:31.611 --> 03:33.943
Guess who's bearing frankincense
this year?

03:39.519 --> 03:41.578
Come here. I want you to see this.

03:41.654 --> 03:42.814
Look.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.982
- Wow.
- Yeah.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.026
It's your mom and dad at their wedding.

03:47.126 --> 03:50.289
I found it in her house after
the funeral, so I had it restored.

03:50.363 --> 03:52.388
I'm gonna give it to her for Christmas.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.330
They did a nice job restoring this.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.767
They were able to airbrush a smile
over your dad's scowl.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.838
No, that's a real smile.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.204
You said he never smiled
at their wedding.

04:02.275 --> 04:04.368
No, he never smiled at our wedding.

04:08.514 --> 04:12.177
- Oh, Tim! Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas, Lillian. How are you?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.152
- It's good to see you.
- Hi, Mom.

04:14.220 --> 04:16.051
- Hello, baby.
- Can I take your coat?

04:16.122 --> 04:19.421
- It's so good to see you.
- Merry Christmas. I love your hair.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.322
- You look gorgeous.
- It's so cute.

04:21.394 --> 04:24.158
How was the trip back with Brad
from the airport?

04:24.230 --> 04:27.165
It was a lot less scary
than when I ride with Tim.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.662
I never knew Detroit had stop signs.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.838
Roundish red things.
Yeah, I've seen them.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.810
Oh, Jill, the tree looks beautiful.

04:40.913 --> 04:42.437
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

04:42.515 --> 04:45.882
Well, except for this spark plug here.

04:48.121 --> 04:52.751
That's right. Every year
Tim sneaks auto parts onto the tree.

04:53.593 --> 04:55.959
And on Easter we have a muffler hunt.

04:57.830 --> 05:01.891
Mom, there's a present that
I want you to open while we're alone.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.334
Oh, no, no. It's not Christmas yet.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.269
No, this one's kind of personal.

05:06.339 --> 05:09.866
I want you to open it while there's not
a lot of other people around.

05:09.942 --> 05:14.106
Speaking of having other people around,
there's something I need to ask you.

05:14.180 --> 05:18.480
Would you mind if I invited a friend
to join us for Christmas?

05:18.551 --> 05:21.111
- Oh, a friend!
- He's really very nice.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.413
He.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.788
His name is Parker and he's an engineer.

05:27.593 --> 05:31.085
He's going to be visiting people
in Detroit during the holidays.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.927
Is... Uh... Mom?

05:33.032 --> 05:36.524
What are you saying?
You're seeing someone? Like dating?

05:36.602 --> 05:39.162
I guess that's
what you would call it.

05:39.272 --> 05:41.968
We've been going out together
for a couple of months.

05:42.041 --> 05:43.599
I really like him.

05:44.310 --> 05:47.973
- Would it be all right if he joined us?
- Sure. It's fine, it's great.

05:48.047 --> 05:50.811
Whatever's gonna make
your Christmas good for you.

05:50.883 --> 05:54.319
I can't tell you how happy that
makes me. I was nervous to tell you.

05:54.387 --> 05:57.515
Oh! Well, now you've told me
and now I know.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.320
So, there's nothing
for anybody to be nervous about.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.122
Let me show you his picture.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.494
I brought a picture along with me
for you to see.

06:06.332 --> 06:07.629
Here it is.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.630
He has a duck tail
and you're wearing a poodle skirt.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.470
Yes, it... it was Fifties Night

06:16.542 --> 06:19.033
at Karaoke Pete's Tandoori Kitchen.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.374
Oh!

06:20.446 --> 06:24.007
<i>Parker does a mean
Blue Suede Shoes.</i>

06:24.083 --> 06:26.176
Yeah, I... I see he's wearing some.

06:26.986 --> 06:28.886
He's... He's just a wild man.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.021
Now, how about that Christmas present?

06:34.594 --> 06:38.758
Oh. You know, now that I look at this,
this isn't the right one.

06:38.831 --> 06:41.493
I'm gonna have to look for it
and give it to you later.

06:41.567 --> 06:45.401
All right. I'm going to call Parker
and tell him that he's invited.

06:45.471 --> 06:48.406
- I can't wait for you to meet him.
- Me, too.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.205
Look at this.

06:52.278 --> 06:54.109
A Partridge in a pear tree.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.848
Tim.

07:09.128 --> 07:11.494
Mom just told me that she's...

07:11.597 --> 07:13.929
...bringing a date for Christmas.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.763
Why doesn't she bring a whole box?

07:15.835 --> 07:18.099
You can put them
in your "Christmas cake."

07:18.171 --> 07:19.934
No. Come here.

07:20.006 --> 07:23.772
His name is Parker. She's been
seeing him for a couple of months.

07:23.843 --> 07:25.333
Wow.

07:25.411 --> 07:28.278
That's, uh, kind of soon.
I mean...

07:28.347 --> 07:31.783
- How do you feel about that?
- Well, I was in shock.

07:31.851 --> 07:35.287
I mean, I'm starting to give her
this photo of her and Dad,

07:35.354 --> 07:37.822
then she starts talking
about this other man.

07:37.890 --> 07:41.417
I didn't feel I could give it to her.
Do you think I'm overreacting?

07:41.494 --> 07:43.792
No. I think
you're taking this very well.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.890
My mom waited 30 years to start dating
and I still think it's too soon.

07:48.801 --> 07:52.100
It's obviously a little awkward for me,
but it's not about me.

07:52.171 --> 07:56.073
So I'm gonna be supportive and when
Parker gets here we'll be hospitable.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.168
It'll be easier for me.
He's not shacking up with my mom.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.443
Whatever I can do to help.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.619
See, Parker, here's my problem.

08:11.691 --> 08:16.025
Even with... Even with Wilsors
allotment of electricity,

08:16.095 --> 08:19.326
I still can't get these mechanical
things to work properly.

08:19.398 --> 08:23.027
If I'm reading this right,
this doesn't say anything about voltage.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.228
Huh?

08:24.303 --> 08:28.205
You can use a 220 volt line for your
appliances instead of the standard 110.

08:28.274 --> 08:31.641
It takes the same 20-amp breaker,
but doubles your power.

08:31.744 --> 08:35.578
Yeah. Double your power,
double your fun. Oh, oh, oh!

08:35.648 --> 08:36.945
Let's go to the garage.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.482
Would you like to know
where Parker and I met?

08:43.556 --> 08:44.989
Uh-huh. OK.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.825
In the frozen vegetable section
of the supermarket.

08:50.963 --> 08:54.228
Nothing says romance
like a bag of frozen succotash.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.469
We chatted a little more in paper goods,

08:59.238 --> 09:02.002
and ended up exchanging life stories
in pet food.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.834
By the time you got to checkout,
you were an item?

09:06.712 --> 09:08.270
It didn't go quite like that.

09:09.615 --> 09:12.106
You want to know what we did
on our first date?

09:12.852 --> 09:14.217
Yeah, sure.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.914
Parker took me dancing.

09:18.991 --> 09:22.222
- I thought you hated dancing.
- No!

09:22.295 --> 09:25.162
Well, it was your father
who didn't care for it.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.063
Do you and Parker go dancing a lot?

09:29.135 --> 09:30.693
Every Saturday night.

09:30.803 --> 09:35.172
A couple of weeks ago he took me
to a square dance festival in Austin.

09:35.775 --> 09:37.538
You drove up for the day?

09:37.643 --> 09:40.203
Well, actually we made a weekend of it.

09:43.516 --> 09:46.041
It's a great idea.
I'll run a line from the garage.

09:46.118 --> 09:49.747
Parker figured out how to get more
electricity and not break the rules.

09:49.822 --> 09:53.121
- This guy's sneaky. I like him.
- You're pretty sneaky yourself.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.717
You figured out
how to use a motor from your dryer.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.794
You're taking apart our dryer?

10:01.867 --> 10:03.732
I'm taking apart the dryer for you.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.136
It's for the holidays.

10:07.239 --> 10:10.174
You won't have to do laundry
until way into the new year.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.904
<i>Guess what,
Tim asked me to come to Tool Time.</i>

10:12.979 --> 10:15.413
Oh, that's wonderful.

10:15.481 --> 10:19.611
Just remember, if Tim uses words like
"tweaked" and "souped up" and "uh-oh,"

10:19.685 --> 10:21.414
you run like hell.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.257
If we're gonna make the Johnsons'
for dinner we better go.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.486
Oh, they're Parker's oldest friends
in the world.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.623
I'm a little nervous about meeting them.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.927
- They're gonna love you.
- Oh.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.629
- How could they not?
- Wait. What time are you gonna be home?

10:37.703 --> 10:40.263
You don't have to wait up, honey.
I have my keys.

10:41.707 --> 10:43.971
- See you later. Have fun.
- Bye.

10:46.612 --> 10:48.170
Parker's a great guy.

10:48.280 --> 10:52.182
Hey, how would you feel about
him becoming part of the family?

11:04.430 --> 11:06.159
You throw pretty good for a girl.

11:10.903 --> 11:13.167
What do you got against Keith Partridge?

11:13.239 --> 11:15.139
He's not dating your mother.

11:16.776 --> 11:20.439
I just... I can't believe
the way that she's acting!

11:20.513 --> 11:22.481
It's like Dad never even existed.

11:22.581 --> 11:26.517
And the way she goes on and on about
her tawdry square dancing weekend.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.746
Come on, it's just
square dancing, honey.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.221
I could just see the two of them,
do-si-do-ing around naked.

11:40.766 --> 11:44.099
It gives new meaning to the words,
"Grab your partner".

11:45.805 --> 11:49.832
And you! You! You! You're going out
of your way to be chummy with him!

11:49.909 --> 11:53.436
I'm being hospitable
because you, you, you asked me to!

11:54.380 --> 11:56.746
<i>You asked him to come to Tool Time.</i>

11:56.849 --> 11:59.215
<i>You never asked my father
to come to Tool Time.</i>

11:59.318 --> 12:01.252
<i>Your father hated Tool Time.</i>

12:01.754 --> 12:04.848
He'd never go. He said,
"I'd rather watch a test pattern."

12:05.591 --> 12:09.687
How come you never took my father's
suggestions about the Christmas lights?

12:09.762 --> 12:13.254
Jill, your father never gave me
suggestions. He gave me orders.

12:13.332 --> 12:15.300
OK, yeah, he was gruff.

12:15.367 --> 12:18.894
He was a very difficult person,
but that doesn't make this easier.

12:18.971 --> 12:22.634
It seems like Mom's happier with Parker
than she ever was with Dad.

12:22.708 --> 12:25.677
That's not the case.
It's because it's a new relationship.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.542
I've got to talk to Mom
about this thing, the way I feel.

12:28.614 --> 12:30.309
- No, no, don't.
- Why not?

12:31.617 --> 12:35.075
It's Christmastime. It's no time
to tell people how you feel.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.919
Does everybody know what time it is?

12:42.995 --> 12:44.428
<i>Tool Time!</i>

12:44.497 --> 12:48.627
That's right. Binford Tools is proud
to present Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

12:52.371 --> 12:53.838
Thank you.

12:53.906 --> 12:57.000
Wow, what a good audience.
Good for you. Thank you, Heidi.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.703
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.</i>

12:58.778 --> 13:01.679
I am Tim "The Yule Man" Taylor.

13:03.349 --> 13:06.079
Of course, you all know
my assistant, Al Borland.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.983
Thank you.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.989
Well, it's almost Christmas,
and Christmas is a time...

13:12.057 --> 13:13.217
...for giving.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.522
Right. And for you last-minute shoppers,

13:15.594 --> 13:18.927
the "Tool Man" here's got a selection
of last-minute gift ideas.

13:18.998 --> 13:23.059
And to start us off,
we have the Binford 6100 Sleep Enancer.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.603
It's for you guys
who can't drift off to sleep.

13:25.671 --> 13:28.572
It produces sounds
to help you deep, deep sleep.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.166
We have "Primeval Forest,"
"Babbling Brook"...

13:31.243 --> 13:33.302
Boring. Boring.
I like this one.

13:36.582 --> 13:37.844
Ahh.

13:39.118 --> 13:42.554
Indy cars going 220 miles an hour.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.657
All right. What do we have next?

13:46.725 --> 13:49.159
I have a big surprise.
I'll be right back.

13:49.228 --> 13:53.665
In the meantime, why don't we look at
some stocking stuffers from Binford?

13:53.732 --> 13:58.066
This year, say "Merry Christmas"
with how-to videos starring Tim and Al.

13:58.137 --> 14:02.403
Right. Show your loved ones how to get
rid of that annoying hum from lights

14:03.042 --> 14:05.670
<i>in Silence of the Lamps.</i>

14:08.347 --> 14:12.283
<i>And learn when to use nails
instead of adhesives in Glueless.</i>

14:14.119 --> 14:17.213
<i>And my personal favorite,
The Nutty Compressor.</i>

14:20.426 --> 14:22.360
They loved this one in France.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.554
And Tim has one more gift to show us.

14:25.631 --> 14:27.155
He said it was a red wagon.

14:27.733 --> 14:30.566
What would a grown man want
with a little red wagon?

14:48.120 --> 14:49.417
Oh, boy.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.921
Wilson, what are you doing?

14:52.992 --> 14:55.552
Well, I'm trying to black out my windows

14:55.628 --> 14:57.789
so I can finally get some sleep.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.799
- Insomnia?
- No, no, no. "Timsomnia."

15:01.867 --> 15:04.233
Here they go!

15:10.542 --> 15:13.238
Do not look directly into the Jesus.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.013
Oh. I brought you a present.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.949
Oh, my goodness.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.318
Oh, boy, that's heavy.

15:24.723 --> 15:26.850
Jill, is it fruitcake?

15:26.926 --> 15:30.089
No, it's not a fruitcake!
It's a Christmas cake.

15:30.162 --> 15:32.323
It's made with mangoes
and papayas and...

15:32.431 --> 15:35.958
Oh, hell, it's a fruitcake!
Fruitcake! Fruitcake! Fruitcake!

15:38.370 --> 15:41.032
I'm sorry, I'm just upset
about this whole thing

15:41.106 --> 15:43.370
with my mother and her new boyfriend.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.535
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.842
Tim says I should wait till
after the holidays to talk to her,

15:48.914 --> 15:52.873
but I'm acting so crazy. I'm throwing
baked goods at Keith Partridge.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.249
I don't know.
What do you think?

15:56.322 --> 15:58.290
Well, he's no Greg Brady, but...

15:58.390 --> 15:59.618
No!

16:00.626 --> 16:03.754
I mean, what do you think
about whether I should talk to her.

16:03.829 --> 16:06.127
Well, I agree
with the poet William Blake,

16:06.198 --> 16:08.723
who said,
"I was angry with my friend

16:08.801 --> 16:12.464
I told my wrath
My wrath did end".

16:12.538 --> 16:15.371
Yeah, but if I talk to her
it could ruin her Christmas.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.103
If you don't,
it could ruin everybody else's.

16:18.177 --> 16:20.509
Wilson, I want
to show you Santa's sleigh.

16:20.579 --> 16:22.444
- Not now.
- It'll take a minute.

16:22.514 --> 16:24.675
- Just a couple minutes.
- I want to show you.

16:24.783 --> 16:27.115
What if I say the wrong thing
and she gets hurt?

16:27.186 --> 16:31.555
Well, she won't if you just express
yourself in a sensitive and tactful way.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.434
Tim, will you keep your freakir Santa
out of my yard?!

16:51.577 --> 16:53.306
Merry Christmas, honey.

16:53.379 --> 16:55.142
Oh, Merry Christmas, Mom.

16:55.214 --> 16:58.581
I told Parker to come over around 9:00
if that's not too early.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.850
Fine.

17:02.254 --> 17:05.621
Jill, are you feeling OK?
You seemed a little quiet last night.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.519
Mom, I have to talk to you
about something. Um...

17:10.362 --> 17:13.729
I hope that you don't hate me
for saying this, but

17:13.799 --> 17:16.632
I am uncomfortable with you dating.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.363
Oh, I see.

17:19.438 --> 17:22.737
It doesn't have anything
to do with Parker. It's just...

17:22.808 --> 17:24.776
...so soon after Dad's death.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.436
Well, it seemed soon to me, too.

17:27.512 --> 17:31.745
That's why when Parker first asked me
out in the grocery store, I said no.

17:31.817 --> 17:35.275
I thought it would be disrespectful
to the memory of your father.

17:35.354 --> 17:38.687
So, you waited
till you got to the parking lot?

17:41.560 --> 17:44.791
For your information,
I turned Parker down for weeks.

17:44.863 --> 17:47.354
I spent a lot of sleepless nights
feeling guilty

17:47.433 --> 17:49.765
for even considering going out with him.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.666
Mom, that's what you should feel!

17:51.737 --> 17:53.898
I mean, you were married to Dad
for 50 years!

17:54.006 --> 17:56.270
It was 51 years.

17:56.341 --> 17:59.504
And seven months. I don't need you
to tell me how I should feel.

17:59.578 --> 18:03.674
Excuse me. I'm having some trouble
having to see you with another man.

18:03.749 --> 18:08.015
It just seems like, I don't know,
like Dad has just been replaced.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.520
Replaced?

18:11.857 --> 18:13.620
Jill.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.859
Your father could never be replaced.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.492
He's still so much a part of my life

18:22.568 --> 18:26.129
that it takes everything I've got
to let someone else in.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.205
I'm sorry, Mom.

18:29.775 --> 18:33.233
I just... I hadrt anticipated how hard
it would be for me to...

18:33.745 --> 18:35.713
...not have Dad here for Christmas.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.544
Well, it's hard for me, too.

18:38.750 --> 18:43.084
I mean, as much as I'm trying
to move on with my life, it...

18:43.155 --> 18:46.488
Not having him around
just tears my heart out.

18:47.593 --> 18:48.753
Oh.

18:49.361 --> 18:52.228
You don't know how happy that makes me.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.231
Well, not happy.

18:56.301 --> 18:59.168
- That sounded awful!
- I know what you mean, honey.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.671
Oh, Mom.

19:00.739 --> 19:02.502
Oh, now, come on now, come on.

19:03.275 --> 19:07.405
Remember when you girls were little and
your father would get up on Christmas

19:07.479 --> 19:10.778
and make his famous apple pancakes?

19:10.849 --> 19:12.077
Oh, yeah.

19:12.151 --> 19:15.018
As soon as he left the room
we fed them to the dog.

19:17.022 --> 19:19.456
Do you think that's what killed the dog?

19:20.993 --> 19:23.223
Well, it was sweet of him
to do it for us.

19:23.295 --> 19:26.731
And nice of him to pass
his cooking skills along to me.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.165
- Mom.
- Hmm?

19:30.235 --> 19:32.999
You remember I wanted you
to open that present?

19:33.105 --> 19:34.800
- Oh, yes.
- Would you do that now?

19:34.873 --> 19:36.636
- Yes, thank you.
- Here.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.874
Here you go.

19:39.511 --> 19:43.379
Oh, look at that.
There's an air filter and a gas cap.

19:48.086 --> 19:49.713
Oh, Jill.

19:50.989 --> 19:53.753
I found it in your house
and I had it restored.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.952
Oh, it's beautiful.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.563
You were a beautiful bride.

19:59.631 --> 20:02.259
Look at that lovely alabaster skin.

20:02.334 --> 20:05.428
No, I was pale 'cause I was stuffed
into that dress so tight

20:05.504 --> 20:08.268
the blood couldn't get to my head.

20:08.373 --> 20:11.536
Of course, Dad's uniform is perfect.
Check out the sword.

20:12.711 --> 20:15.077
That wasrt just for show, you know.

20:16.248 --> 20:18.944
What? You're gonna tell me
he cut the cake with it?

20:19.017 --> 20:22.578
No, he used it to cut me
out of that dress.

20:24.690 --> 20:28.251
All right, Dad. Judges are
out front. Turn on your lights.

20:28.327 --> 20:30.693
- Judges, you all ready?
- Ready.

20:30.796 --> 20:33.264
One, two, three.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.211
Oh!

20:49.715 --> 20:51.273
Dad!

20:51.350 --> 20:53.784
Your Santa bounced off
three different cars.

20:53.852 --> 20:56.013
What did the judge think of the lights?

20:56.121 --> 20:58.885
We'll let you know
when he regains consciousness.

21:03.662 --> 21:07.291
Christmas is over. Your wife might have
got you stuff you didn't want.

21:07.366 --> 21:08.526
So, what do you do?

21:08.634 --> 21:11.660
I say exchange them
for some how-to videos

21:11.737 --> 21:14.228
from Binford's new
home video collection.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.934
<i>Like this one,
our newest, Look Who's Caulking.</i>

21:21.046 --> 21:25.415
<i>The most important thing when
caulking is to get a smooth seal.</i>

21:25.517 --> 21:27.485
<i>I like to use a harbor seal.</i>

21:30.155 --> 21:32.817
<i>- Right, Al?
- I don't think so, Tim.</i>

21:32.891 --> 21:36.258
<i>Concentrate on the work
or there could be an accident.</i>

21:36.328 --> 21:39.764
<i>Actually, there's already
been an accident.</i>

21:40.299 --> 21:41.732
<i>Mom!</i>

21:45.037 --> 21:47.403
I never knew Detroit had stop signs.

21:48.373 --> 21:51.638
Those octagonal red things? Yeah.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.871
Are those octagons?

21:56.248 --> 21:58.079
Just... are they octagonal?

21:58.617 --> 22:00.744
Well, I scared myself with that word.

22:03.355 --> 22:06.085
I never knew Detroit had stop signs.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.126
Ah. Those octagonal red things. No.

22:10.862 --> 22:13.228
I never knew Detroit had stop signs.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.364
Those are those octagonal red...
