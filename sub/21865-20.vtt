Bailey's on vacation. Yeah.
Wha...?

Who approved that?

16:50.910 --> 16:52.712
BOWMAN:
Randy's books were cooked.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.814
Do you see the pattern?

16:54.814 --> 16:57.416
Of course I see it.

16:57.416 --> 16:58.751
What am I looking at?

16:58.751 --> 17:01.420
Cash sales twice a month.
Look at the price.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.155
$50K!

17:03.155 --> 17:05.191
Either they have some
high‐end sunglasses, or...

17:05.191 --> 17:06.559
Or they were using
the shop as a front

17:06.559 --> 17:09.328
to hawk stolen goods.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.163
Great work, Bowman.

17:11.163 --> 17:12.565
Now, aren't you glad

17:12.565 --> 17:14.300
we volunteered you
for this assignment?

17:14.300 --> 17:15.735
Mm‐hmm‐hmm.
I told Riggs,

17:15.735 --> 17:17.470
and he said he's gonna stop
by the stepfather's shop

17:17.470 --> 17:18.671
on his way back.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.373
Way back from where?

17:20.373 --> 17:24.110
Not sure, but he wanted me to
get him a traffic citation pad.

17:24.110 --> 17:26.579
LATIMER:
<i>You got to be kidding me.</i>

17:26.579 --> 17:27.880
I wish I was, sir,

17:27.880 --> 17:29.715
but parking violations are
a serious crime

17:29.715 --> 17:31.117
in the city of Los Angeles.

17:31.117 --> 17:34.353
Okay, so how much is
this gonna cost me?

17:34.353 --> 17:37.323
I can't take your money, Coach.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.624
Do I know you?

17:38.624 --> 17:42.862
Look, I can overlook
this ticket... and the bribe

17:42.862 --> 17:44.697
if you play Ben Hendricks
the next game.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.132
Wait a minute.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.533
So, you're extorting
me into starting a kid

17:47.533 --> 17:48.734
in a Little League game?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.636
I think he'd make
a great second baseman.

17:50.636 --> 17:53.306
You know, Ben asked
me to sit him.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.640
He didn't want to play.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.410
What are you talking about?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.644
He's a good kid,

17:58.644 --> 18:01.180
but he sat in the dugout
the whole game.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.182
I think it's because he
doesn't know how to play.

18:03.182 --> 18:06.218
He can't hit,
throw, catch...

18:06.218 --> 18:08.087
Well, you're his coach.
Why don't you teach him?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.323
I don't have time to go through
the basics with every kid.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.724
Look, if it matters
so much to you,

18:11.724 --> 18:13.392
teach your son yourself.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.094
He's not my son.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.696
Not every kid's
an athlete.

18:16.696 --> 18:19.465
Look, maybe he should
try something else.

18:19.465 --> 18:20.600
Like painting.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.705
I really wish
you hadn't said that.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.643
You arrested
a Little League coach?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.745
He tried to blame <i>me</i> for Ben
hating America's pastime.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.213
Okay, what was I supposed to do?

18:34.213 --> 18:37.750
Hear him out.
Not overreact. Be patient.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.385
The cornerstones
of being a parent?

18:39.385 --> 18:41.687
Oh, wait a minute,
you're gonna lecture me

18:41.687 --> 18:42.688
on being a father today?

18:42.688 --> 18:43.889
Really? Come on.

18:43.889 --> 18:45.725
Riana knows she screwed up,
okay?

18:45.725 --> 18:47.259
And she's grounded.

18:47.259 --> 18:49.729
I bet she's up in her room
right now thinking about

18:49.729 --> 18:50.863
what she did.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.231
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You know,

18:52.231 --> 18:53.766
maybe I should get
a statue, Rog,

18:53.766 --> 18:57.303
because you are father
of the year, Roger Murtaugh.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.304
I gotta let you go.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.239
Thank you for
your time, sir.

19:00.239 --> 19:03.175
Have a great day.

19:03.175 --> 19:06.712
Stanley Wright?
Uh, LAPD.

19:06.712 --> 19:09.215
Uh, I want to talk to
you about your stepson.

19:09.215 --> 19:11.684
Right, right.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.186
(clattering)

19:14.186 --> 19:15.788
Look, I'm‐I'm sorry
for your loss.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.790
MAN:
Where the hell is it, old man?

19:17.790 --> 19:20.593
Nothing downstairs.
Just these old boxes.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.729
So, I've just walked
in on a robbery.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.385
(two gunshots nearby)

19:46.385 --> 19:49.155
(woman screams)

19:51.290 --> 19:53.125
(siren wailing)

19:53.125 --> 19:54.293
(gunfire, tires screeching)

19:54.293 --> 19:56.262
(car horn honks)

19:56.262 --> 19:57.496
(automatic gunfire)

19:57.496 --> 19:58.531
MAN:
This is the police.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.366
We have you surrounded.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.367
(helicopter blades whirring)

20:01.367 --> 20:02.768
Come out with your hands up.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.437
(automatic gunfire)

20:04.437 --> 20:06.205
(siren wailing)

20:08.474 --> 20:10.776
(gunfire)

20:13.379 --> 20:14.747
(man shouts)

20:14.747 --> 20:17.750
(grunting)

20:17.750 --> 20:20.820
RIANA:
Riggs?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.621
What are you doing here?

20:22.621 --> 20:25.324
Riana?
I thought you were grounded.

20:25.324 --> 20:26.592
(grunts)

20:33.325 --> 20:36.395
Don't look at the glass.

20:36.395 --> 20:39.699
No one's coming to save you.

20:39.699 --> 20:42.268
Not till you answer
my questions.

20:42.268 --> 20:43.903
Understand?

20:43.903 --> 20:45.638
Yes, sir.

20:45.638 --> 20:49.475
All right, tough guy...

20:49.475 --> 20:54.513
how long have you been
canoodling with my daughter?

20:54.513 --> 20:55.748
It was just our first date.

20:55.748 --> 20:57.383
There was absolutely no...

20:57.383 --> 20:58.417
Canoodling.

20:58.417 --> 21:00.653
We just went
to see a movie.

21:00.653 --> 21:03.856
Even though Riana
was grounded?

21:03.856 --> 21:06.192
Well, w‐we thought it wouldn't
be a big deal to just...

21:06.192 --> 21:08.794
Oh, yeah,
forget the rules, Jesse.

21:08.794 --> 21:11.363
I bet you're gonna
tell me,

21:11.363 --> 21:13.632
"It was all Riana's idea."

21:13.632 --> 21:15.201
Uh...

21:15.201 --> 21:18.771
Does my daughter smoke pot?
What about house parties?

21:18.771 --> 21:22.475
You ever been to a sick rager
up at Riana's crib?

21:22.475 --> 21:25.444
N‐No. Riana?
(chuckles)

21:25.444 --> 21:27.279
No way, sir. I mean,
that sounds like

21:27.279 --> 21:28.481
something my sister
Phoebe would do.

21:28.481 --> 21:32.585
And then blame it on me.

21:32.585 --> 21:33.819
Phoebe's <i>your</i> sister?

21:33.819 --> 21:35.488
Yes, sir.
I mean,

21:35.488 --> 21:36.822
my mom's kind of hard on her.

21:36.822 --> 21:38.290
It's like she can't help
but act like a lunatic.

21:38.290 --> 21:40.659
(laughs)
So‐so, uh,

21:40.659 --> 21:42.828
<i>Phoebe</i> is the troublemaker.

21:42.828 --> 21:46.665
And my Riana is innocent.

21:46.665 --> 21:48.501
Yeah. I mean,
Riana's the best.

21:48.501 --> 21:50.302
You can tell how much
she looks up to you, sir.

21:50.302 --> 21:54.607
Hey. You know what? You're gonna
overplay your hand. Go on.

21:57.409 --> 21:59.278
(door opens)

21:59.278 --> 22:01.247
RIGGS: All right,
who's the smart one

22:01.247 --> 22:02.815
that took off running
when he saw the badge?

22:02.815 --> 22:06.719
His name is Nico Vicente.
Ex‐military guy.

22:06.719 --> 22:08.254
Did business with my stepson.

22:08.254 --> 22:09.188
Is that who killed him?

22:09.188 --> 22:13.793
Nico thought Randy
was stealing from him.

22:13.793 --> 22:16.228
Some shipment of diamonds
was missing from his house.

22:16.228 --> 22:18.531
That's what they
were after at the shop.

22:18.531 --> 22:19.799
You know where the shipment is?

22:19.799 --> 22:21.834
No. I stayed away from all that.

22:21.834 --> 22:23.769
You stayed out
of all that?

22:23.769 --> 22:25.538
But you let him
run a black market

22:25.538 --> 22:27.106
out the back
of your shop.

22:27.106 --> 22:28.207
Look,

22:28.207 --> 22:32.378
Randy was always
a very difficult kid.

22:32.378 --> 22:34.847
Never had much in the way
of a role model.

22:34.847 --> 22:39.385
His dad did a real number
on him before he took off.

22:39.385 --> 22:40.719
And God forbid you be a man.

22:40.719 --> 22:43.122
Right?
I tried!

22:43.122 --> 22:45.591
God, what the hell did I know
about being a father?

22:48.360 --> 22:49.461
NATHAN:
That little punk

22:49.461 --> 22:51.897
struck you out all day,

22:51.897 --> 22:55.134
and you shake hands with him
like he's your pal?

22:55.134 --> 22:57.703
It was the end
of the game, Dad.

22:57.703 --> 23:01.273
Soft, just like her.

23:01.273 --> 23:03.609
0 for 4.

23:03.609 --> 23:06.478
I don't even...
Damn, that's embarrassing.

23:06.478 --> 23:08.214
I got dis‐distracted.

23:08.214 --> 23:11.283
Distracted? What the hell
you distracted by?

23:11.283 --> 23:13.385
You.

23:13.385 --> 23:15.688
I saw you
by the fence,

23:15.688 --> 23:17.623
watching.

23:17.623 --> 23:19.758
You know what, son?

23:22.528 --> 23:24.563
Maybe I didn't give you
a proper lesson.

23:25.431 --> 23:26.599
You see, the key

23:26.599 --> 23:28.634
to getting a hit...

23:29.768 --> 23:33.105
is all about making contact.

23:35.441 --> 23:37.142
It's all about form.

23:38.644 --> 23:41.647
Hands bottom up, palm down.

23:41.647 --> 23:42.781
Get it right!

23:42.781 --> 23:46.218
You understand me?!

23:46.218 --> 23:47.386
(grunting)

23:51.223 --> 23:54.059
Dad! Dad!

23:58.297 --> 23:59.732
(bat clatters)

23:59.732 --> 24:01.834
Let me see.

24:04.603 --> 24:06.071
Be still.

24:18.550 --> 24:22.721
Soft, just like I said.

24:31.096 --> 24:33.098
RIGGS:
<i>Okay.</i>

24:33.098 --> 24:36.268
Let's just toss
it around, nice and easy, okay?

24:36.268 --> 24:38.504
But I suck.

24:38.504 --> 24:40.105
Hey. You don't suck.

24:40.105 --> 24:42.374
Look, Babe Ruth didn't learn
how to catch a baseball

24:42.374 --> 24:43.542
until he was 40,
all right?

24:43.542 --> 24:45.311
And they named a candy bar
after him, so...

24:45.311 --> 24:46.278
Is that true?

24:46.278 --> 24:48.547
I don't know, maybe.
But you smiled, so...

24:48.547 --> 24:50.249
All right,
here we go.

24:50.249 --> 24:51.750
Watch the ball.

24:52.651 --> 24:55.220
It's okay, it's okay.
Come on.

24:58.257 --> 25:01.427
It's okay. Here you go.
Let the glove do the work.

25:01.427 --> 25:05.331
Let the glove do the work.

25:05.331 --> 25:08.233
Hey!
Yeah!

25:08.233 --> 25:10.202
Nice job, buddy.

25:10.202 --> 25:12.204
Now bring the heat.

25:12.204 --> 25:13.605
Whoo!

25:14.606 --> 25:16.675
Buddy!
Yeah!

25:16.675 --> 25:20.546
Good job. You're a natural,
you know that?

25:20.546 --> 25:22.648
Hey, Mom, check out Ben.
He's a natural.

25:22.648 --> 25:26.118
Nice, buddy.
We need to talk.

25:26.118 --> 25:26.952
What's that?

25:26.952 --> 25:28.754
Did you...?
Okay, hold on. Pop fly.

25:28.754 --> 25:31.290
Did you arrest Coach Latimer?
Ow!

25:31.290 --> 25:35.194
(groans) Mom, Mom.
Hey. Are you okay?

25:35.194 --> 25:36.562
You all right?

25:36.562 --> 25:38.230
Hey, buddy,
hey, let me see.

25:38.230 --> 25:39.798
Get your head back,
get your head back.
Come here.

25:39.798 --> 25:41.333
Get your head back.
Ow.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.502
Let's go.
You're gonna be
all right, man.

25:43.502 --> 25:45.070
Ow. (whimpers)

25:47.306 --> 25:49.575
(door opens and closes)

25:49.575 --> 25:51.677
(soul music playing)

25:58.317 --> 26:00.152
Hey, where's Ri?

26:00.152 --> 26:02.221
I sent her to bed
without dinner.

26:02.221 --> 26:03.322
Really?

26:03.322 --> 26:07.259
Roger, no, but I did revoke
her phone privileges.

26:08.527 --> 26:10.763
Are you starting to second‐guess
how we're handling this?

26:12.097 --> 26:14.800
Roger, I don't want
to be the bad guy here.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.136
Well, look, I'm starting
to think that

26:17.136 --> 26:20.773
maybe we're too hard on her.
It's like you said, right?

26:20.773 --> 26:23.375
We shouldn't sweat
the small stuff.

26:23.375 --> 26:24.810
Oh, my gosh, Roger.

26:24.810 --> 26:28.781
There is nothing small
about her friend being involved

26:28.781 --> 26:30.482
in a homicide case.

26:30.482 --> 26:33.118
Right, but Riana wasn't involved
in that. I talked to Jesse,

26:33.118 --> 26:35.587
and he reassured me...
Jesse? (chuckles)

26:35.587 --> 26:39.491
Really? The boy she was out on a
date with when she was grounded.

26:39.491 --> 26:41.593
You talked to him?
He's actually a nice kid.

26:41.593 --> 26:43.095
A little dorky.

26:43.095 --> 26:44.797
Oh, gosh.
I don't know why
she always goes

26:44.797 --> 26:46.765
for the dorky ones, but...

26:46.765 --> 26:49.134
Look, can I at least
go see how she's doing?

26:49.134 --> 26:51.570
Roger, no.

26:51.570 --> 26:53.372
She lied to us twice.

26:53.372 --> 26:57.242
Okay? We need to stick
together in this.

26:57.242 --> 26:58.744
There's no good cop, bad cop.

26:58.744 --> 27:00.779
I'm not being a good cop.
I just want to

27:00.779 --> 27:03.148
talk to my daughter.

27:03.148 --> 27:04.083
Your daughter?

27:04.083 --> 27:06.218
Yeah. My daughter.
Hmm...

27:06.218 --> 27:08.787
And you know what, if I want
to talk to <i>my</i> daughter,

27:08.787 --> 27:10.222
that's what I'm gonna do.

27:10.222 --> 27:13.125
Roger... Roger.

27:19.398 --> 27:21.366
Where's your daughter?

27:22.634 --> 27:24.503
♪ ♪

27:24.503 --> 27:25.737
(siren wailing)

27:25.737 --> 27:27.840
PHOEBE:
<i>I cannot believe</i>

27:27.840 --> 27:29.641
this is your first time
sneaking out.

27:29.641 --> 27:32.244
I know. My parents are going
to freak when they realize.

27:32.244 --> 27:34.246
So just blame me.
That's what I would do.

27:34.246 --> 27:37.583
(laughs) So what's
the big emergency, anyway?

27:37.583 --> 27:40.752
See for yourself. You ready?

27:44.723 --> 27:46.825
Holy crap. Phoebe,
are those real?

27:46.825 --> 27:48.694
Oh, where'd you even get those?

28:02.708 --> 28:05.677
Tyler, let's go
for a ride, huh?

28:09.681 --> 28:12.217
(elevator bell dings)

28:14.620 --> 28:17.456
Murtaugh, I'm at your
disposal. I'll do...
Not now, Scorsese.

28:17.456 --> 28:19.658
Tell me you have every uni
awake looking for her.

28:19.658 --> 28:21.059
Yeah, yeah, I've
sent out a BOLO.

28:21.059 --> 28:22.494
I'll be Bailey
and track her phone.

28:22.494 --> 28:24.630
I've also reported your car
as stolen to OnStar.

28:24.630 --> 28:27.099
(phone ringing)

28:27.099 --> 28:28.834
Hey, Trish. Is she there yet?

28:28.834 --> 28:30.502
TRISH:
No. I've called everyone.

28:30.502 --> 28:31.670
Okay, well, breathe.

28:31.670 --> 28:33.505
(phone ringing)

28:33.505 --> 28:34.740
Guys, OnStar.

28:34.740 --> 28:36.608
Hold on.
This is Detective Bowman.

28:36.608 --> 28:38.477
Hi, this is Patty from OnStar.

28:38.477 --> 28:40.412
We have a location
on the stolen vehicle.
Oh, great.

28:40.412 --> 28:42.347
It is stationary,
and we have sent the signal

28:42.347 --> 28:43.348
to block the ignition.

28:43.348 --> 28:45.250
Thank you. They found the car.
It's stationary.

28:45.250 --> 28:47.519
They've sent out the signal
to block the ignition.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.488
Can I get a location
on the vehicle?

28:49.488 --> 28:51.690
TRISH: Roger, what if something
happened? What if she's hurt?

28:51.690 --> 28:53.525
Hey, it's gonna be
all right, okay?

28:53.525 --> 28:54.793
Look, let me call you back.

28:54.793 --> 28:56.595
I don't even know
why I told you.

28:56.595 --> 28:57.863
I should've known
you would freak out.

28:57.863 --> 28:59.598
You have to turn those in.
And say what? Huh?

28:59.598 --> 29:01.200
That I found them?

29:01.200 --> 29:02.734
They'll know that I stole them
and I'll go to jail.

29:02.734 --> 29:04.403
Let me call my dad and...
No, no, no.

29:04.403 --> 29:06.638
The last time I talked
to your dad, I ended up

29:06.638 --> 29:09.208
in a police station.
Phoebe, he can help.

29:09.208 --> 29:12.411
Okay, if you just explain what
happened, he'll understand.

29:12.411 --> 29:14.046
Please, just take me home.

29:16.148 --> 29:18.150
(beeping)

29:20.352 --> 29:22.221
What is going on?

29:22.221 --> 29:25.657
Oh, no, uh, my parents must have
reported the car stolen.

29:26.558 --> 29:27.659
(Phoebe laughs)

29:27.659 --> 29:29.061
No, no, it's great, it's great,

29:29.061 --> 29:31.330
so they just, they just
shut down the car?

29:31.330 --> 29:34.399
Seriously? Look, I'm getting
out of here, but, Ri...

29:34.399 --> 29:37.002
promise you're not
gonna tell your dad.

29:39.805 --> 29:41.607
Okay?
Okay.

29:45.544 --> 29:47.779
(turns key)
(beeping)

29:48.680 --> 29:50.415
(siren wailing)

29:50.415 --> 29:52.150
Yeah, okay.

29:52.150 --> 29:54.319
Yeah, they‐they found the car.

29:54.319 --> 29:56.321
Riana's wallet
was on the front seat.
Riana?

29:56.321 --> 29:58.123
Is she still there?
Let me talk to her.

29:58.123 --> 30:00.559
She was gone before
they got there.

30:00.559 --> 30:01.860
(siren wailing)

30:01.860 --> 30:04.229
(door opens and closes)

30:04.229 --> 30:05.564
Hey!

30:05.564 --> 30:07.099
Where is everybody?

30:07.866 --> 30:09.134
Hey, I didn't know what flavor

30:09.134 --> 30:10.602
he wanted,
so I got one of each.

30:10.602 --> 30:11.870
Thanks. I think
he needs to rest.

30:11.870 --> 30:14.373
But I'll try them.

30:14.373 --> 30:15.340
So how's he doing?

30:16.508 --> 30:18.310
Nose isn't broken,
but he's gonna bruise.

30:20.279 --> 30:21.580
It's crazy, I mean, obviously,
the last thing

30:21.580 --> 30:22.848
I want to do is,
you know, hurt him.

30:22.848 --> 30:24.850
I know that.
He knows that.

30:24.850 --> 30:27.719
But maybe you went
a little overboard,

30:27.719 --> 30:29.187
arresting his coach?

30:29.187 --> 30:32.724
So, most dads don't do
that kind of thing?

30:32.724 --> 30:35.494
Most dads don't have a badge.

30:35.494 --> 30:36.895
Right.

30:36.895 --> 30:41.400
Hey, listen, I know your heart
was in the right place.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.869
You don't have to force it.
You'll figure it out.

30:43.869 --> 30:45.304
Just give it time.

30:45.304 --> 30:47.606
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, I...

30:47.606 --> 30:49.207
Riggs. Hey.

30:50.375 --> 30:52.344
It was an accident.

30:56.848 --> 30:58.784
YOUNG MOLLY:
<i>How bad does it hurt?</i>

30:58.784 --> 31:00.886
It's fine.

31:00.886 --> 31:05.624
Okay, hold still.

31:08.193 --> 31:09.761
(winces)

31:17.169 --> 31:21.340
You can't stay here.
Come to my house.

31:21.340 --> 31:22.574
I can't.

31:22.574 --> 31:24.743
This is my home.

31:24.743 --> 31:28.213
He's gonna kill you, Martin.

31:28.213 --> 31:31.817
It was an accident, Molly.

31:36.722 --> 31:38.824
(car horn honking in distance)

31:41.493 --> 31:43.462
(indistinct conversation)

31:45.464 --> 31:48.066
Riggs.
Yeah?

31:49.534 --> 31:52.871
Riana. You had everyone
in the precinct looking for you.

31:52.871 --> 31:55.240
I screwed up,
I know that, I...

31:55.240 --> 31:57.476
I just... really
need some help.

31:57.476 --> 31:59.611
All right, let's go upstairs
and talk to your dad.

31:59.611 --> 32:01.680
No, no, I can't.

32:02.647 --> 32:05.317
I just... I know
it sounds stupid,

32:05.317 --> 32:08.420
but I made a promise
that I can't tell him.

32:08.420 --> 32:10.822
And I don't even know
how I could face him.

32:10.822 --> 32:12.858
(clears throat)

32:12.858 --> 32:17.195
I want you to listen
to something for me.

32:17.195 --> 32:19.197
MURTAUGH: Riggs. Hey, man,
we tracked down the car,

32:19.197 --> 32:22.467
but Riana wasn't inside.
I'm starting to freak out.

32:22.467 --> 32:23.668
Running out of places to look.

32:23.668 --> 32:25.437
I tried the school,
bowling alley,

32:25.437 --> 32:28.373
zoo, mall, ice rink,
natural history museum.

32:28.373 --> 32:30.175
She used to love
those dinosaur bones.

32:30.175 --> 32:31.443
We used to call...
(beep)

32:31.443 --> 32:34.713
So... I've got, like,
20 more just like that.

32:34.713 --> 32:37.582
He, you know, gets
nostalgic when he panics.

32:37.582 --> 32:39.818
Come on.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.688
It's Riana Rose.

32:43.688 --> 32:46.525
Yeah, just... the picture, yeah.

32:46.525 --> 32:49.761
All right‐‐ well, she looks
a little like her mother.
Dad?

32:49.761 --> 32:51.763
I'll call you back.

32:51.763 --> 32:53.231
I'm so sorry for scaring you.

32:53.231 --> 32:55.267
I never meant to hurt you.

32:56.401 --> 32:58.336
It's okay, I'm just glad
you're all right.

33:00.872 --> 33:02.774
Where the hell were you?

33:02.774 --> 33:04.709
I was worried sick,
my stomach was in a knot.

33:04.709 --> 33:06.378
You know I have IBS.
Dad. Dad.

33:06.378 --> 33:08.647
Phoebe has these diamonds,
I think she stole them

33:08.647 --> 33:10.282
from the house
they broke into.

33:10.282 --> 33:12.284
Where is she?
She's at home.

33:12.284 --> 33:13.418
And...

33:13.418 --> 33:14.753
that's where I crashed
last night.

33:14.753 --> 33:16.321
Okay, call your mother
right now,

33:16.321 --> 33:19.291
and then, you sit here,
until she comes to pick you up.

33:20.692 --> 33:22.194
(elevator bell dings)

33:22.194 --> 33:23.762
(music playing over earbuds)
(phone ringing)

33:23.762 --> 33:25.464
(humming)

33:25.464 --> 33:27.732
Hey, baby.

33:27.732 --> 33:29.334
Hey, Phoebs.

33:29.334 --> 33:31.169
Do you still have
those diamonds with you?

33:31.169 --> 33:32.671
Come see for yourself.

33:32.671 --> 33:35.540
I'm on my way.
Don't go anywhere, okay?

33:35.540 --> 33:37.676
(beeps)

33:37.676 --> 33:39.211
(line clicks, phone beeps)

33:39.211 --> 33:40.479
Good boy.

33:40.479 --> 33:41.713
(chuckles)

33:53.458 --> 33:55.393
(knocking on door)

33:58.497 --> 34:00.432
(phone buzzing)

34:05.136 --> 34:07.239
Baby?

34:07.239 --> 34:11.309
Always look through the
peek hole before you answer.

34:11.309 --> 34:12.711
Anybody else here?

34:12.711 --> 34:13.812
What is going on?

34:13.812 --> 34:15.447
Where are the diamonds, Phoebe?

34:15.447 --> 34:17.082
I don't know what
you're talking about.

34:17.082 --> 34:18.316
Look, we don't have time
for this.

34:18.316 --> 34:19.584
Bad men with guns
are coming to get them back.

34:19.584 --> 34:21.586
Riana told you.

34:21.586 --> 34:22.854
RIGGS:
Well, technically,

34:22.854 --> 34:23.855
she told me first‐‐
which, we can sort

34:23.855 --> 34:25.223
all that out later, first...

34:25.223 --> 34:25.891
(guns clicking)

34:25.891 --> 34:27.225
I was just holding her hand.

34:27.225 --> 34:27.959
I swear.

34:27.959 --> 34:29.661
Is there another
way out of here?

34:30.462 --> 34:31.730
I think she knows of one.

34:36.568 --> 34:38.036
(panting)

34:42.641 --> 34:43.742
(grunts)

34:45.377 --> 34:46.578
Hey.

34:46.578 --> 34:48.446
Phoebe, how are you?

34:48.446 --> 34:50.115
(doorknob rattling)

34:50.115 --> 34:51.416
(quietly):
Come here.

34:54.619 --> 34:56.187
You stay low and quiet.

34:56.187 --> 34:57.489
No, no, please, I'm afraid
of the dark. Please.

34:57.489 --> 34:59.658
You dork, why does
my daughter even like you?

34:59.658 --> 35:01.326
Wait, Riana likes me?

35:01.326 --> 35:02.761
So, uh,

35:02.761 --> 35:04.229
why don't you come on
inside here and let's talk

35:04.229 --> 35:05.497
about what's...
Can't go to jail.

35:05.497 --> 35:06.565
All right, well, I don't think

35:06.565 --> 35:08.266
the, uh, the fire escape

35:08.266 --> 35:10.835
is a viable option, so why don't
you just give me your hand,

35:10.835 --> 35:12.103
Phoebe, and let's come in...

35:12.103 --> 35:13.171
Stay away from me!

35:14.606 --> 35:16.207
(doorknob rattling)

35:28.587 --> 35:30.355
(whispers):
Maybe they left.

35:32.857 --> 35:34.392
(automatic gunfire)
(high‐pitched scream)

35:38.597 --> 35:39.464
(screams)

35:41.800 --> 35:42.867
Oh, my God.

35:42.867 --> 35:44.836
Oh, my God.
Hey. Phoebe.

35:44.836 --> 35:46.338
Hey, listen to me.

35:46.338 --> 35:47.005
Listen to me.

35:47.005 --> 35:48.740
Everything's gonna be okay.

35:48.740 --> 35:49.741
You stay right out here.

35:49.741 --> 35:51.176
What?
Don't move.

35:51.176 --> 35:52.344
Do not try to get
to that fire escape.

35:52.344 --> 35:53.545
I'll be right back.
No, no, no!

35:53.545 --> 35:54.679
Don't leave,
don't leave!

35:54.679 --> 35:56.281
I'm gonna fall. Oh, my God.

35:56.281 --> 35:59.684
(crying):
Come back, please.

35:59.684 --> 36:01.486
Okay, okay, I'm here.

36:01.486 --> 36:03.455
I'm here, okay?

36:03.455 --> 36:06.291
On the count of three,
I'm gonna pull you in the room.

36:06.291 --> 36:07.459
Okay?
Okay.

36:07.459 --> 36:08.460
All right, three,

36:08.460 --> 36:09.494
two...
Don't rush me!

36:09.494 --> 36:11.630
Okay.

36:11.630 --> 36:12.764
Okay.

36:12.764 --> 36:14.165
Go at your own pace.

36:14.165 --> 36:16.101
I'm‐I'm here when you're ready.

36:22.641 --> 36:24.843
Um... but the sooner
the better.

36:24.843 --> 36:26.244
All right, Nico!

36:26.244 --> 36:28.713
We done here? Want
to put the gun down?

36:33.752 --> 36:35.253
(gun clicks)

36:37.522 --> 36:39.190
(whimpers)
All right.

36:39.190 --> 36:40.692
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

36:40.692 --> 36:42.027
You ready?

36:45.664 --> 36:47.432
(panting)

36:47.432 --> 36:49.167
(screams)

36:54.339 --> 36:55.373
(grunts)

36:56.741 --> 36:59.210
(shouting)

36:59.210 --> 37:01.079
Pull me up,
please. Please!

37:01.613 --> 37:02.714
Rog!

37:02.714 --> 37:05.283
It's okay, I got this!
(Phoebe screams)

37:06.351 --> 37:07.619
PHOEBE:
Please, please, please, please.

37:08.453 --> 37:09.821
(screams)

37:09.821 --> 37:11.389
Pull me up, please, please.

37:11.389 --> 37:12.724
(grunting)

37:12.724 --> 37:14.059
PHOEBE:
I'm too young to die!

37:14.793 --> 37:16.695
(grunting)

37:18.129 --> 37:19.464
PHOEBE:
Please, please.

37:19.464 --> 37:20.565
Please, I can't die.

37:20.565 --> 37:21.466
(Murtaugh shouts)
Please!

37:23.702 --> 37:25.270
(screams)

37:30.508 --> 37:33.211
(panting)

37:33.211 --> 37:34.713
Grab me. Grab me, please.
All right.

37:34.713 --> 37:37.248
Please, don't let me die.
Don't let me fall.
Come on.

37:37.248 --> 37:38.516
(Phoebe sobbing)

Hey, bud.

(door closes)

38:13.151 --> 38:14.719
Mind if I join you?

(groans)

38:21.726 --> 38:23.328
How you feeling?

38:23.328 --> 38:25.029
Fine.

38:26.731 --> 38:30.401
Mind if I take a peek?

38:30.401 --> 38:32.337
See the carnage?

38:34.672 --> 38:37.242
Hey.
(quietly):
Ow.

38:37.242 --> 38:40.078
You just got a
little battle scar.

38:40.078 --> 38:42.080
Chicks dig those, man.

38:46.317 --> 38:48.787
So, um...

38:48.787 --> 38:52.490
You know, my‐my dad,

38:52.490 --> 38:56.561
he was a... he was
a pretty rough guy.

38:56.561 --> 38:57.762
You know?

38:57.762 --> 39:01.199
And, um,

39:01.199 --> 39:03.434
he used to hurt me,
when I was a little boy.

39:05.670 --> 39:10.642
So yesterday, when you got hurt,

39:10.642 --> 39:13.011
I mean, that scared me to death.

39:14.779 --> 39:16.447
So, look,

39:16.447 --> 39:20.552
if you want to play baseball,
I'll drive you down there.

39:20.552 --> 39:24.289
If you don't want
to play baseball, that's fine.

39:24.289 --> 39:28.393
Either way, I'm gonna be
right there, by your side.

39:28.393 --> 39:29.694
Okay?

39:29.694 --> 39:31.763
I just want you to be happy.

39:33.364 --> 39:36.201
I think I'll give it
another shot.

39:36.201 --> 39:36.801
Yeah?

39:36.801 --> 39:38.136
Yeah.
All right.

39:38.136 --> 39:39.337
Well, go get your stuff.

39:39.337 --> 39:41.239
But...

39:41.239 --> 39:44.375
what if someone hits me
with the ball again?

39:44.375 --> 39:48.346
Well, you know, I mean,
it's baseball, right?

39:48.346 --> 39:52.417
So, if you get hit in the game
of baseball, it's really not...

39:52.417 --> 39:53.651
(quietly): If you get
beaned more than twice,

39:53.651 --> 39:54.719
you charge the mound.

39:54.719 --> 39:55.720
(chuckles)
All right?

39:55.720 --> 39:57.455
Yeah.
All right.

39:57.455 --> 39:59.691
Oh, hey, hey, don't tell your
mom I said that, though, okay?

39:59.691 --> 40:01.793
All right.
All right.

40:11.469 --> 40:13.872

40:17.642 --> 40:18.710

40:18.710 --> 40:20.378
you lied to us,

40:20.378 --> 40:21.613
you broke curfew...

40:21.613 --> 40:24.449
