00:12.380 --> 00:13.802
Mr. Reddington.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.637
So pleased you made it, sir.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.908
Ha! So am I.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.372
What a ride.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.970
You can't imagine
what it took
to get here.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.215
And might I say
not a moment too soon.

00:23.250 --> 00:26.014
We are in for
qUIte a storm.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.016
Arthur Rodman.
I'm at your serwce.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.823
What a place.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.452
This is lovely.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.288
I'm sorry.
I wasn't prepared for...

00:34.330 --> 00:35.991
You were told _
no seconds are permitted?

00:36.030 --> 00:38.191
Oh, no, no,
Dembe won't be staying.

00:38.230 --> 00:40.061
Raymond, are you sure
this place is secure?

00:40.100 --> 00:43.160
RODMAN: Oh, you needn't worry.
The island is a safe haven.

00:43.210 --> 00:47.203
Mr. Vries, our owner,
offers it to men and women
such as Mr. Reddington

00:47.240 --> 00:50.243
as a place to do business
or resolve disputes

00:50.280 --> 00:52.612
with absolute privacy
and security.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.039
And your property
is the only one
on the island, yes?

00:55.080 --> 00:59.187
Yes. My employer
provides staff,
lodging, fine dining.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.882
You should go
before the sky
gets any darker.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.057
Please.

01:03.090 --> 01:06.218
And don't worry.
I'll see you here
in two days,

01:06.260 --> 01:07.693
and we'll celebrate.

01:07.730 --> 01:09.425
I don't trust
Cassandra.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.960
Ah.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.195
Eat a whole pizza,
read a couple
of great books.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.232
Maybe take the kids skating.
My God, I can't remember

01:16.270 --> 01:19.398
the last time
you had a whole
weekend off.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.998
Two days, Raymond.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.270
Remember,
you promised Agnes
to be at the ballet.

01:23.310 --> 01:24.800
I'll see you Sunday.

01:24.850 --> 01:27.273
**

01:27.320 --> 01:28.571
Not to worry.

01:32.890 --> 01:34.710
A|| firearms
will be kept in a safe

01:34.760 --> 01:36.728
until the proceedings
are complete.

02:01.780 --> 02:04.749
There he is.
In the flesh.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.424
You're looking like
the best of times.

02:10.460 --> 02:12.519
I wasn't sure _
you were gomg to make It.

02:17.530 --> 02:20.192
I had to come.
I couldn't let down
the others.

02:20.240 --> 02:22.800
The others. Mm.

02:22.840 --> 02:26.901
Well, to be honest,
I was hoping that part
of you came for me.

02:28.380 --> 02:29.938
The best part did.

02:32.180 --> 02:33.613
You brought
your piece?

02:34.520 --> 02:35.578
Of course.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.315
(LAUGHS)

02:37.350 --> 02:38.681
Then it's official.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.585
We have the complete set.

02:40.620 --> 02:42.679
_ You'_re convinced
It's the right time to sell?

02:42.730 --> 02:45.290
Iam. But, um...

02:45.330 --> 02:47.491
_Re|ax.
Busmess later.

02:47.530 --> 02:49.964
I'll lay everything out
for the group tonight.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.434
RODMAN: We will stay out
of your way during your stay,

02:52.470 --> 02:54.097
but anything you need,
Mr. Reddington,

02:54.140 --> 02:55.459
don't hesitate to ask.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.501
Thank you, Arthur.

03:01.110 --> 03:04.102
Think it's bugged?

03:04.150 --> 03:06.618
Annika, your brow
is already furrowed.

03:06.650 --> 03:07.810
(LAUGHS)

03:07.850 --> 03:10.387
I swept my whole room...
The basket, the vents.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.115
It appears clean.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.481
That's a relief.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.817
Mm.

03:14.860 --> 03:15.918
You bring it?

03:15.960 --> 03:17.552
Hmm. I brought it.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.182
I didn't want to touch it,
but...

03:19.230 --> 03:21.152
(LAUGHS)
Same old Annika.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.997
You've been reading
ghost stories.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.692
Not ghost stories,
news stories.

03:25.730 --> 03:27.539
It came
from a tomb, right?

03:27.570 --> 03:29.094
The original dig
was in Turkey...

03:29.140 --> 03:30.937
Give me a hug.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.870
Three of the archaeologists
are dead...

03:32.910 --> 03:35.208
One pancreatic cancer,
one suicide,

03:35.240 --> 03:37.708
one heart disease.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.809
You think
the caskets we stole

03:39.850 --> 03:41.875
gave an archaeologist
pancreatic cancer?

03:41.920 --> 03:43.512
They are cursed.

03:43.550 --> 03:44.744
(NEBULIZER HISSES)
I believe you.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.519
Well, I believe
you believe you.
Mm-hmm.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.757
That innate sense of danger
is what drove you to become

03:49.790 --> 03:53.954
perhaps the single best
security expert I know.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.195
I'm right.
Don't touch it.

03:56.230 --> 03:58.164

Have you seen
the others?

03:58.200 --> 03:59.758
Mm, just Margo.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.768
You think
I haven't changed?

04:01.800 --> 04:04.507
(CHUCKLES) Come on.

04:04.540 --> 04:06.735

where you'd think
she'd be.

**

04:09.280 --> 04:13.114
(CHUCKLES) Ready, Margo?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.808
Thirty seconds.

04:17.550 --> 04:18.539
Go.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.222
Ah. Know what
I'm thinking, Margo?

04:23.260 --> 04:24.727
I'm thinking
of all the ways

04:24.760 --> 04:28.025
I'm going to be
spending your moneys, yes?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.925

REDDINGTON: I can name
three other can openers
who could crack those locks.

04:54.490 --> 04:57.084
Only one could do it
in 30 seconds,

04:57.130 --> 05:00.395
and none could do it
after a half pint of aquavit.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.921
Reddington,
you dapper dog.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.119
Margo, you're a Viking.

05:04.170 --> 05:05.899
Five grand says
I can do it again in 20.

05:05.930 --> 05:09.434
No dice.
I came here to make money,
not give it away.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.306
Good evening, Margo.

05:12.340 --> 05:13.807
(LOUDLY)
Hello, Mahmoud.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.001
Mahmoud, your hearing
has gotten worse?

05:16.040 --> 05:18.247
Oh, it's not all gone.
Butsoon.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.975
I'm terribly sorry.

05:20.020 --> 05:23.080
You're kind. But when
I decided to blow things
up for a living,

05:23.120 --> 05:25.281
I knew there'd be
occupational hazards.

05:25.320 --> 05:30.019
Tell me, did I detect
a chill in the air
from the two of you?

05:30.060 --> 05:32.620
Are you on again
or off again?

05:32.660 --> 05:34.491
(DOOR OPENS)
Ah.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.964
Welcome, everyone.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.560
Thank you for coming.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.693
I hope after
what you're about to hear,

05:41.740 --> 05:45.460
you'll decide
that it has been worth it.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.831
Let's talk business.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.472
It's been just
under three years

05:49.510 --> 05:51.398
since I first
went to Reddington,

05:51.450 --> 05:54.010
told him about the caskets,
asked him to fund the job...

05:54.050 --> 05:55.711
You have buyer or not?

05:55.750 --> 05:57.411
Let her talk.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.850
I want to say
we did the right thing.

05:59.890 --> 06:03.485
No legitimate fence
would've touched
what we had.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.421
Every art crime cop
in every continent
was watching.

06:07.460 --> 06:09.860
The right thing to do
was Split it and wait.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.458
And you think
it's been long enough?

06:11.500 --> 06:15.038
I do. We've seen a number of
high-profile thefts this year.

06:15.070 --> 06:18.130
The FBI, INTERPOL,
they're busy elsewhere.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.330
It's time to move.

06:19.370 --> 06:21.179
Who's the buyer?

06:21.210 --> 06:26.307
A collector, with a particular
interest in Byzantine art.

06:26.350 --> 06:30.286
I did some research
and floated the idea
last month.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.185
You Should've
asked us first.

06:32.220 --> 06:34.017
I agree.
I don't.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.210
As the architect,

06:36.260 --> 06:39.081
it's Cassandra's right
to explore a next move.

06:39.130 --> 06:40.825
Everything was done
anonymously.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.169
He has no idea who we are,

06:43.200 --> 06:45.998
but he is on his way,
and weather permitting,

06:46.030 --> 06:47.566
he should be here
this time tomorrow.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.238
What kinda bread
we baking?

06:49.270 --> 06:51.101
Ah, it's hard to know.

06:51.140 --> 06:54.906
Each individual piece
could be worth a few million,

06:54.940 --> 06:59.104
but the complete set
increases the potential
number to maybe...

06:59.150 --> 07:00.412
Seventy-five.

07:00.450 --> 07:02.714
No, that's high.
Come on.

07:02.750 --> 07:06.652
The Blue Wittelsbach-Graff
Diamond went for over $23 mil.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.682
The Qianlong vase
went for 53,

07:09.730 --> 07:12.290
or maybe you think
I'm too dumb
to do my homework.

07:12.330 --> 07:13.957
Take it easy.
Easy?

07:14.000 --> 07:17.299
The five of you
got 18% each.

07:17.330 --> 07:21.061
That's even _cut
for each specralty.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.763
But me, I'm just
a goon with a gun,
so I only get 10%?

07:24.810 --> 07:28.075
No way I'm letting
you undersell and cut
my take even more.

07:28.110 --> 07:29.873
Keep your voices down.
Nobody wants to undersell...

07:29.910 --> 07:32.276
You know what? Rules say

07:32.310 --> 07:35.245
we don't sell
unless It's unanimous,

07:35.280 --> 07:39.683
so maybe I don't
agree to anything
until my cut is even!

07:39.720 --> 07:40.948
That's enough, Joko.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.423
You got 10%
because you came in late,

07:46.460 --> 07:50.464
not because anyone here
undervalues your contribution.

07:50.500 --> 07:54.061
As far as I'm concerned,
the goon with the gun,

07:54.100 --> 07:56.534
he's the real operator.

07:56.570 --> 07:59.300
He's the one who has to handle
himself under pressure

07:59.340 --> 08:01.171
when things go sideways.

08:01.210 --> 08:04.702
He's the one
everyone else
has to rely on.

08:04.750 --> 08:08.072
The goon with the gun
doesn't do his job,
there is no job.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.417
We needed you.

08:09.450 --> 08:12.487
Nobody's ever said otherwise
except maybe you.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.956
At the end of the day,
you accepted your cut,

08:15.990 --> 08:17.651
and it's done.

08:17.690 --> 08:21.490
**

08:21.530 --> 08:25.022
So, let's all take a breath
and remember we're friends.

08:26.130 --> 08:27.563
I vote we sell.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.636
Agreed.
The sooner the better.

08:29.670 --> 08:31.706
Agreed.
Then I make five.

08:38.350 --> 08:39.339
Agreed.

that they get her remains.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.393
What do you think
happened to her?

What is it?

10:20.580 --> 10:22.116
What do you see?

that's not helpful right now.

Y-You think
I'm kidding?

10:30.790 --> 10:32.382
Margo was number four.

10:32.430 --> 10:34.227
Four bodies
connected to
these caskets

10:34.260 --> 10:35.557
in the three years
since they were found!

10:35.600 --> 10:36.624
She said stop it.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.422
Everyone, just
try to calm down.

10:38.470 --> 10:39.596
What could've happened?

10:39.630 --> 10:41.734
Come on.
Are you serious?

10:41.770 --> 10:43.203
I'll tell you what happened.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.105
Diabetes. Hypertension...

10:45.140 --> 10:46.266
You hardly knew her.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.971
I don't have to know her.
Look at her.

10:48.010 --> 10:50.945
Morbidly overweight,
probably alcoholic.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.039
Did she smoke?
Yes, but...

10:53.080 --> 10:55.071
Then the question isn't
why it happened.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.610
It's why it didn't
happen sooner.

10:56.650 --> 10:58.641
REDDINGTON:
All right, Joko,
you made your point.

10:58.690 --> 11:00.817

in less than eight minutes

11:02.660 --> 11:04.355

11:04.390 --> 11:07.154
She had ice_water
In her veins.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.760
Okay, She didn't
make healthy choices,

11:09.800 --> 11:13.167
but this had nothing
to do with stress

11:13.200 --> 11:16.829

or a curse.

11:22.310 --> 11:25.347
Why? Who would do that?

11:25.380 --> 11:28.110
Someone who stands to gain
from her death.

11:28.150 --> 11:29.788
That could be
any one of us.

11:29.820 --> 11:32.288
Before, it was
a six-way split.
Now it's only five.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.515
Perhaps,
but only one of us

11:34.560 --> 11:36.653
was complaining about
the Size of their percentage.

11:36.690 --> 11:38.555
You think I killed
your girlfriend?

11:38.590 --> 11:39.989
She wasn't my girlfriend.

11:40.030 --> 11:41.657
That's right.
You two broke up,

11:41.700 --> 11:42.962
so maybe you killed her.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.467
Maybe you can't handle idea

11:44.500 --> 11:46.195
of her shacking up
with someone new.

11:46.230 --> 11:47.333
Go to hell!

11:47.370 --> 11:48.530
Mahmoud, look at me.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.708
We are genuinely sorry
for your loss.

11:52.740 --> 11:55.334
But the truth is,
we don't have enough evidence

11:55.380 --> 11:57.871
to start accusing each other
of homicide.

11:59.780 --> 12:02.317
I suggest
we all turn in early

12:02.350 --> 12:03.385
and look at this

12:03.420 --> 12:04.546
with fresh eyes
in the morning.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.556
What about
Margo's casket?

12:07.590 --> 12:10.479
If everyone agrees,
I'll hold onto it for now.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.952
We do.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.151
Everyone else,
take yours with you.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.067
We'll reconvene here
at 7:00 am.

Do you remember
what happened

12:25.870 --> 12:28.179
the last time you knocked
on my door at 2:00 am?

12:28.210 --> 12:29.370
Yes, you shot at me.

12:29.410 --> 12:31.469
I thought you were
someone else.

12:31.510 --> 12:32.841
You thought
I was your husband.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.872
I like committing
crimes of passion.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.342
Want to commit one now?

12:38.820 --> 12:41.653
I had something
a bit more frigid
in mind.

12:42.590 --> 12:44.353
Petechial hemorrhages?

12:44.390 --> 12:46.483
Broken blood vessels

12:46.530 --> 12:47.849
in her eyes.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.492
Also on the inside
ofheerS

12:49.530 --> 12:52.021
and underneath
her ﬁngernails.

12:52.070 --> 12:53.537
That means
she was pOIsoned?

12:53.570 --> 12:57.939
Not definitively, no,
but it certainly suggests it.

12:57.970 --> 13:01.030
We won't know for sure
until we open her up.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.172
What?

13:02.210 --> 13:04.303
We need towels,

13:04.810 --> 13:06.869
tongs, and a ladle.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.218
Doesn't matter what Size.

13:12.020 --> 13:15.080
Boy, you really know
how to Show a girl
a good time.

13:16.990 --> 13:19.891
Tell me,
do you do autopsies
during all your dates,

13:19.930 --> 13:22.797
or am I special?

13:31.510 --> 13:34.308
I never heard from you
after Marseilles.

13:35.110 --> 13:37.078
Was a perfect job.

13:37.110 --> 13:40.876
An even more perfect four days
together at Hotel de la Mer.

13:42.350 --> 13:43.840
Can I have a towel?

13:45.890 --> 13:47.687
Raymond.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.927
I've walked away
from Marco.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.325
From everything.

13:52.190 --> 13:53.589
Ithought
you would, too.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.025
I was going to.

13:59.670 --> 14:02.935
Till I found out
we took nearly $40 million
from that vault,

14:02.970 --> 14:04.198
not 30.

14:05.270 --> 14:09.570
You're either very bad at math
or very good at lying.

14:09.610 --> 14:10.838
I'm good at both.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.438
What I'm terrible
at is life.

Another towel.

14:14.650 --> 14:17.016
(SIGHS)

14:20.560 --> 14:25.623
After Marseilles,
I heard about a job
in Lisbon.

14:25.660 --> 14:28.356
Big score,
but it came with
a big overhead.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.824
Tunneling gear,
commercial grade,
the works.

14:31.870 --> 14:35.738
I thought about
bringing it to you,
but I couldn't.

14:37.070 --> 14:40.528
You say you walked away
because I took the money,

14:40.580 --> 14:43.378
but I took it because
you'd already walked away.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.346
Can you hold that?

14:50.950 --> 14:52.542
I shouldn't
have done it,

14:52.590 --> 14:54.512
but I was hurt, and...

14:55.660 --> 14:56.786
I regret it.

14:57.890 --> 14:59.551
You have no reason
to believe me,

15:01.860 --> 15:02.849
but I do.

15:04.930 --> 15:06.261
Tell me about Lisbon.

15:08.100 --> 15:12.332
Uh, I invested
everything I had

15:12.370 --> 15:14.429
and even some
I didn't have.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.344
And then,
at the last minute,

15:17.380 --> 15:19.803
just two days before
we were set to move,

15:19.850 --> 15:22.546
the museum
shipped the piece
back to New York,

15:22.580 --> 15:27.813
made a secret deal
to trade exhibits,
and that was it.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.885
_ I lost
my entire Investment.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.421
Why are you
telling me this?

15:32.430 --> 15:33.692
You asked.

15:33.730 --> 15:35.425
You brought it up.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.298
Why?

15:38.330 --> 15:41.936
Because I've had a run
of bad luck lately,

15:41.970 --> 15:44.404
and I've been thinking
a lot about why.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.600
You sound like Annika.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.029
(SCOFFS)
It's no accident

15:48.080 --> 15:51.049
that things went wrong
when I burned what we had.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.719
I would do anything
to take it back,

15:54.550 --> 15:56.415
to go back to that suite

15:56.450 --> 15:57.610

16:38.590 --> 16:40.990
This didn't happen
naturally.

16:41.030 --> 16:42.452
Someone killed her.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.662
Someone on this island.

MAHMOUD: Murdered?

16:50.240 --> 16:52.162
You wanted a _forensic
Investigation.

16:52.210 --> 16:54.030
That's what it showed.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.138
Where's Joko?

16:55.180 --> 16:56.670
I-I knocked
on his door.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.041
And you're sure?

16:58.980 --> 17:01.141
Yes.
She was poisoned,

17:01.180 --> 17:05.014
_ closed with
an anti-coagulating agent.

17:05.050 --> 17:07.154
D-Dosed?
You... You mean injected?

17:07.190 --> 17:09.909
It seems more likely
it was administered orally,

17:09.960 --> 17:12.053
in her food
or something she drank.

17:12.090 --> 17:13.318
Last night at dinner?

17:13.360 --> 17:15.999
What I saw
would've taken hours
to develop...

17:16.030 --> 17:17.759
Six, maybe even eight.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.290
What time
did Margo get here?

17:19.330 --> 17:20.866
Yesterday morning.
We all did...
W-W-What you saw?

17:20.900 --> 17:22.629
You did an autopsy?
You cut her open?

17:22.670 --> 17:25.002
So it happened
here on the island.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.179
I saw you
having breakfast with her.

17:28.910 --> 17:31.208
You think I killed her?
As far as motives go,

17:31.250 --> 17:33.070
there aren't any
more powerful than love.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.815
Money.

17:34.850 --> 17:36.943
Maybe, but if money
were the objective,

17:36.980 --> 17:39.642
why stop there? Why not
kill the rest of us, too?

17:39.690 --> 17:41.180

gang to ask!

This calls
for a celebration.

In the south of France,
perhaps.

38:49.590 --> 38:50.784
Do you mean that?

As you said,
I fulfilled my obligation.
