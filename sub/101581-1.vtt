00:36.954 --> 00:39.391
<i>Police say the
man was a Good Samaritan</i>

00:39.424 --> 00:42.092
<i>stabbed while trying
to stop a mugging.</i>

00:42.126 --> 00:44.596
<i>Surveillance video shows
the man bleeding to death</i>

00:44.629 --> 00:46.997
<i>on the sidewalk for over an hour</i>

00:47.031 --> 00:50.000
<i>as 25 people passed him by.</i>

01:00.378 --> 01:02.846
<i>The man
continues to attack the women,</i>

01:02.880 --> 01:05.583
<i>knocking them both
to the ground for a second time</i>

01:05.617 --> 01:09.119
<i>while people stand by
and film the assault.</i>

01:16.960 --> 01:19.029
<i>In a video that has gone viral,</i>

01:19.063 --> 01:21.065
<i>a young girl
is brutally attacked,</i>

01:21.098 --> 01:24.068
<i>and instead of helping her,
people pull out their cellphones</i>

01:24.101 --> 01:25.903
<i>and record the incident.</i>

01:39.083 --> 01:41.653
<i>In what has become
an all too familiar occurrence,</i>

01:41.686 --> 01:44.021
<i>the victim was attacked
while bystanders,</i>

01:44.054 --> 01:47.091
<i>including security guards,
stood by and watched.</i>

01:47.124 --> 01:49.327
<i>The victim is still
in critical condition.</i>

01:49.361 --> 01:52.930
<i>Her family is demanding that the
witnesses be held accountable,</i>

01:52.963 --> 01:54.932
<i>but there are no laws
compelling people</i>

01:54.965 --> 01:57.335
<i>to help others
in distress or danger.</i>

02:11.316 --> 02:13.418
<i>A drunk
driver slams into the man.</i>

02:13.451 --> 02:15.018
<i>As he lies crumpled
on the street</i>

02:15.052 --> 02:16.254
<i>for almost two minutes,</i>

02:16.287 --> 02:19.189
<i>a total of 15 cars drive by him.</i>

02:19.223 --> 02:20.625
<i>No one stops to help.</i>

02:33.705 --> 02:35.306
<i>As the beating continued,</i>

02:35.340 --> 02:37.575
<i>several people
filmed the assault.</i>

02:37.609 --> 02:40.210
<i>The victim later died
from his injuries.</i>

02:40.244 --> 02:42.045
<i>But the story doesn't end there.</i>

02:42.079 --> 02:43.581
<i>In an eerie coincidence,</i>

02:43.615 --> 02:46.418
<i>after posting
the shocking video online,</i>

02:46.451 --> 02:49.052
<i>two witnesses
were later found dead.</i>

03:58.690 --> 03:59.591
Dad?

04:01.326 --> 04:03.394
What are you doing?

04:03.428 --> 04:04.395
Happy Birthday?

04:05.396 --> 04:07.365
I'm making pancakes.

04:07.398 --> 04:11.569
- Was trying to make pancakes.
- I love you.

04:11.603 --> 04:14.706
And I love the effort, but,
you know, maybe you should stop.

04:16.307 --> 04:19.377
Your mom always had birthday pancakes
ready for you when you woke up.

04:21.579 --> 04:25.115
That is right,
Mickey Mouse face and sprinkles.

04:26.116 --> 04:27.452
It's been years.

04:29.787 --> 04:33.190
Well, I still want my key back.

04:33.223 --> 04:35.092
That was for emergencies only.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.628
This was an emergency.

04:36.661 --> 04:39.697
I thought I'd start
your day with a smile.

04:39.731 --> 04:43.066
Okay, fine, you can keep the key
if it makes you feel better.

04:49.340 --> 04:51.208
- Who is that?
- Mm?

04:52.377 --> 04:54.244
Probably Josh.

04:54.279 --> 04:56.213
Birthday surprise.

04:56.246 --> 04:58.650
Ha! He's bringing
you the birthday sex.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.386
Ew.

05:01.419 --> 05:04.355
Dad, no.

05:04.389 --> 05:07.157
Oh, my God.
And who says "the sex?"

05:07.190 --> 05:09.594
Ugh.

05:14.766 --> 05:15.667
Okay.

05:16.801 --> 05:18.403
- Okay.
- Dad...

05:18.436 --> 05:20.237
Daddy! Dad!

05:20.271 --> 05:21.773
Where is the money?

05:21.806 --> 05:23.474
- Where is the money?
- Leave him alone!

05:23.508 --> 05:25.410
Caitlin!

05:32.149 --> 05:32.884
Why!

05:57.207 --> 05:59.844
<i>Come on.</i>

05:59.877 --> 06:02.847
<i>We've got a pulse.</i>

06:02.880 --> 06:04.315
<i>She's coming back.</i>

06:08.519 --> 06:10.822
I was going
through my dad's old Bible.

06:10.855 --> 06:14.425
- Mm-hmm.
- And inside there is this note that he had written.

06:15.360 --> 06:17.562
He loved his mottos.

06:19.330 --> 06:21.299
And it said...

06:22.567 --> 06:26.671
"Sometimes you have
to choose to be happy."

06:27.839 --> 06:28.840
That is great.

06:30.408 --> 06:31.643
But I am worried...

06:32.744 --> 06:34.912
I'm still having hallucinations.

06:34.946 --> 06:37.180
That is normal as you heal.

06:37.214 --> 06:39.851
Honestly,
your recovery is miraculous.

06:50.962 --> 06:52.897
Did Zach check the server?

06:52.930 --> 06:54.632
I knew it.

06:54.666 --> 06:56.467
Jesus, just forget it.
I'll come in.

07:00.571 --> 07:02.707
I got to head back
in the office,

07:02.740 --> 07:04.442
I leave for a few hours,
the whole place falls apart.

07:04.475 --> 07:07.345
Oh, no worries, I'm good. Uh...

07:08.479 --> 07:11.416
I actually just called the school
about getting my old job back.

07:11.449 --> 07:13.718
- Really? Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

07:15.586 --> 07:17.755
You around a bunch
of little rug rats?

07:17.789 --> 07:19.490
Careful,
you might catch a baby fever.

07:22.527 --> 07:23.561
You never know.

07:27.832 --> 07:29.667
Looking for your stash?

07:31.569 --> 07:34.572
Jerk, I told you I will quit next month.

07:34.605 --> 07:36.941
I know, it's always next month.

07:36.974 --> 07:38.776
Don't worry, you can still
get all your nicotine fix,

07:38.810 --> 07:41.244
just without all the tar,
and cancer, and...

07:41.279 --> 07:43.981
Fine, fine,
no more procrastinating.

07:44.015 --> 07:45.583
Heard that before.

07:47.318 --> 07:48.886
Maybe you should think
about getting out.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.256
I am. I think
I'm going to go for a run.

07:52.290 --> 07:53.524
I was thinking...

07:54.926 --> 07:56.694
something a little bit
more permanent.

07:58.663 --> 08:01.899
They caught the guys, I'm safe.

08:01.933 --> 08:05.503
I know, I just thought maybe
it'd be good for your recovery.

08:05.536 --> 08:09.440
This is my house. I'm not going to
let them take that from me, too.

08:10.374 --> 08:11.275
You're right.

08:12.443 --> 08:14.679
Enjoy the run.
I'd come with you, but...

08:14.712 --> 08:17.381
They need your big brain
at the office.

08:18.082 --> 08:21.452
Have I ever told you I think
nerds are incredibly sexy?

08:21.486 --> 08:22.420
Um.

08:24.555 --> 08:26.991
It's geeks, babe,
the term is geeks.

08:27.024 --> 08:28.726
- Bye.
- Bye, I love you.

09:15.606 --> 09:17.008
...I'm so lost.
No, no, no, no,

09:17.041 --> 09:18.576
you said that
she was moving out,

09:18.609 --> 09:20.778
- you promised me.
- Stop being hysterical.

09:20.812 --> 09:21.913
It's just taking...

09:23.114 --> 09:24.615
Just chill.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.055
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

09:31.088 --> 09:32.957
- Just embarrassed.
- No, don't be.

09:32.990 --> 09:36.527
- Douglas.
- Caitlin.

09:36.561 --> 09:37.728
Well, have a good run, Caitlin.

10:18.569 --> 10:20.037
Help me.

10:20.071 --> 10:21.906
Give me your phone,
give me your phone!

10:21.939 --> 10:22.840
What are you doing?

10:28.880 --> 10:30.481
Does this look like the guy?

10:33.885 --> 10:36.053
- Ms. Kramer?
- Um? Um.

10:36.087 --> 10:37.521
Does this look like the guy?

10:39.523 --> 10:40.958
Yeah.

10:40.992 --> 10:41.893
Good.

10:42.927 --> 10:44.862
We'll put out an APB.

10:44.896 --> 10:47.531
I'll call you
if I have any more questions.

10:47.565 --> 10:51.002
Has your number changed
since your father's case?

10:51.035 --> 10:52.069
Mm-mm.

10:53.004 --> 10:55.439
Do you think
he's going to be all right?

10:55.473 --> 10:56.540
It's hard to say right now.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.142
Okay.

11:00.211 --> 11:02.813
- Can I go get some air?
- Yeah, let's go.

11:09.921 --> 11:12.490
There is nothing
I could've done.

11:12.523 --> 11:14.125
He could've had a gun.

11:15.126 --> 11:17.929
- You can't expect me to risk...
- ...I probably could've taken him,

11:17.962 --> 11:20.965
but she grabbed my arm,
scared he might have a gun.

11:20.998 --> 11:22.500
She asked me
not to leave her, so...

11:22.533 --> 11:25.836
...I recorded it
for you guys, you know?

11:25.870 --> 11:27.071
In case he got away.

11:33.577 --> 11:35.146
You sure you don't want
to talk about it?

11:40.952 --> 11:43.020
<i>I should warn
you, the video footage</i>

11:43.054 --> 11:44.889
<i>you're about
to see is disturbing.</i>

11:44.922 --> 11:47.191
<i>Video of the assault
in Bristol Park</i>

11:47.224 --> 11:49.593
<i>and the fact that several
bystanders stood by</i>

11:49.627 --> 11:51.095
<i>and just watched it happened</i>

11:51.128 --> 11:53.497
<i>has sent shockwaves
through the city.</i>

11:53.531 --> 11:54.999
<i>Douglas Helton was a good man</i>

11:55.032 --> 11:56.667
<i>involved in a lot
of charitable works</i>

11:56.701 --> 11:58.437
<i>around the city and his death...</i>

12:00.305 --> 12:04.809
<i>Well, it tears me up. And judging
from the public outcry, I'm not alone.</i>

12:04.842 --> 12:06.911
<i>Now, joining us on today's show</i>

12:06.944 --> 12:08.980
<i>is the man
who filmed the attack,</i>

12:09.013 --> 12:11.949
<i>computer programmer,
Nathan Rome.</i>

12:11.983 --> 12:14.252
<i>Nathan, welcome, thanks for
speaking with us today.</i>

12:14.286 --> 12:18.055
<i>Thank you for having me,
I feel horrible about what happened,</i>

12:18.089 --> 12:21.625
<i>and I just wanted an opportunity
to explain myself.</i>

12:21.659 --> 12:23.094
<i>Yes, go ahead.</i>

12:23.127 --> 12:24.962
<i>Please, explain away.</i>

12:24.996 --> 12:26.731
<i>Tell us how you could
just stand there</i>

12:26.764 --> 12:29.000
<i>and watch a man
get beaten to death.</i>

12:29.033 --> 12:32.770
<i>Basically, if you, if anyone
had done anything at all,</i>

12:32.803 --> 12:35.906
<i>he would still be alive.</i>

13:01.132 --> 13:03.134
<i>Help me.</i>

13:34.131 --> 13:35.032
Hey, you.

13:36.401 --> 13:37.701
Hungry?

13:41.972 --> 13:43.774
I couldn't sleep last night.

13:44.909 --> 13:47.178
I can't stop thinking
about Douglas.

13:47.211 --> 13:48.979
I feel awful.

13:49.013 --> 13:50.181
What happened to him, it...

13:51.148 --> 13:53.251
It's horrible.
But, babe, that is not on you.

13:54.752 --> 13:58.323
I read online that there is
a vigil in the park tonight.

13:59.824 --> 14:03.328
- I think I can go after church.
- Want me to meet you there?

14:03.361 --> 14:05.162
You don't want
to come to church?

14:06.130 --> 14:07.865
I'll go for you.

14:07.898 --> 14:10.268
You know,
church isn't really my thing.

14:10.302 --> 14:12.970
I mean, you don't want I start
going all Damien with the thrashing

14:13.003 --> 14:14.406
- and the screaming.
- It's okay.

14:14.439 --> 14:15.906
- Yeah.
- I...

14:18.209 --> 14:19.710
I can just meet you after.

14:21.112 --> 14:22.347
Okay.

14:22.380 --> 14:23.981
I should probably do this
on my own.

14:49.940 --> 14:50.908
Hey.

14:51.876 --> 14:54.979
We didn't get a chance to,
uh, talk earlier.

14:56.947 --> 14:57.848
Althea.

14:58.983 --> 14:59.950
Caitlin.

15:01.453 --> 15:03.421
I don't see
any of the others here.

15:04.889 --> 15:06.157
I almost didn't come.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.429
I thought coming here might
give me a sense of closure.

15:13.398 --> 15:14.698
I have a son...

15:15.866 --> 15:16.800
Jesse.

15:19.069 --> 15:21.672
His father died
years ago and, uh...

15:22.907 --> 15:24.842
I lost my job and our house.

15:26.877 --> 15:27.945
He's my world.

15:30.147 --> 15:32.850
I got no regrets
about what I did.

15:32.883 --> 15:34.785
Excuse me.

15:34.818 --> 15:35.753
Did you all know Doug?

15:37.188 --> 15:38.856
Uh, yeah.

15:39.757 --> 15:40.691
Through work.

15:41.426 --> 15:43.261
I'm Lucas, his brother.

15:44.496 --> 15:46.464
If you two are free
this weekend,

15:46.498 --> 15:47.932
we're doing a tribute video.

15:49.066 --> 15:51.035
I'd love to have you all
come share some memories of him.

15:51.969 --> 15:52.870
I'll try.

15:55.940 --> 15:57.708
I'm sorry about your brother.

15:58.776 --> 16:00.378
I lost my dad recently.

16:01.346 --> 16:03.847
I know how hard it is.

16:03.881 --> 16:05.216
Well, the police said
a witness came forward,

16:05.249 --> 16:06.784
so I hope they'll catch
the guy soon.

16:07.985 --> 16:09.720
And those people who watched.

16:12.290 --> 16:13.258
I'm glad you came.

16:14.124 --> 16:15.893
I know Doug would've
appreciated it.

16:17.462 --> 16:18.363
Thank you.

16:22.500 --> 16:24.134
I got to get home to my boy.

16:26.937 --> 16:27.972
I made my peace.

16:30.542 --> 16:33.110
- You take care.
- Thanks, you too.

16:57.835 --> 16:59.837
Christ, forgive me.

17:12.384 --> 17:15.118
At the end, all of the candles
just blew out.

17:17.021 --> 17:18.922
Felt like somebody walked
over my grave.

17:21.025 --> 17:22.359
I still feel that chill.

17:23.861 --> 17:24.994
I guess I'll warm you up.

17:30.368 --> 17:31.969
Hot chocolate.

17:32.002 --> 17:33.538
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

17:33.571 --> 17:35.473
You've seriously
never seen this?

17:35.507 --> 17:36.940
Where have you been, on Mars?

17:37.941 --> 17:39.277
Check it.

17:39.311 --> 17:40.612
He totally wails on the dude.

17:42.614 --> 17:44.549
And the dude tried
to crawl away.

17:44.582 --> 17:46.451
And, bam! Kidney punch.

17:46.484 --> 17:48.520
Hey, that is messed up.

17:48.553 --> 17:50.288
And you're messed up
for watching it.

17:50.322 --> 17:52.390
Want to know
something really messed up?

17:52.424 --> 17:55.460
Nathan Rome,
the guy who took this,

17:55.493 --> 17:56.927
he lives right upstairs.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.095
No way.

18:04.669 --> 18:08.038
- Oh, God.
- Caitlin, it's just a coincidence.

18:09.341 --> 18:10.342
I'll be right back.

18:25.189 --> 18:27.592
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

18:31.228 --> 18:33.365
<i>So, basically, if you,</i>

18:33.398 --> 18:36.100
<i>if anyone had done
anything at all,</i>

18:36.133 --> 18:38.403
<i>he would still be alive.</i>

18:44.576 --> 18:47.211
- Honey, are you all right?
- Something is wrong. Something is wrong.

18:54.151 --> 18:56.321
I... Um...

19:18.443 --> 19:20.944
Caitlin.

19:27.552 --> 19:28.453
Caitlin.

19:31.756 --> 19:34.359
Hey, hey, wow, easy, easy.

19:38.763 --> 19:41.499
- How is your head feeling?
- Uh, it's throbbing.

19:41.533 --> 19:43.167
Yeah, I bet,
that was a nasty fall.

19:44.234 --> 19:46.304
Luckily, though, no concussion.

19:47.572 --> 19:48.706
So...

19:50.174 --> 19:52.075
You said you saw someone.

19:52.109 --> 19:54.178
In the window, I...

19:54.211 --> 19:56.046
I didn't get a good look at him.

19:56.079 --> 19:58.182
They said they found
a note in his place

19:58.215 --> 19:59.950
saying he was sorry.

20:01.453 --> 20:03.421
They think that
because of his issues

20:03.455 --> 20:07.325
- and being outed like that, but...
- No. No, I'm sure I saw someone.

20:17.502 --> 20:21.339
<i>The coroner's report says
that Nathan Rome died at 9:12,</i>

20:21.372 --> 20:23.475
<i>the same time as Douglas Helton.</i>

20:23.508 --> 20:26.277
<i>This eerie coincidence
has not gone unnoticed</i>

20:26.311 --> 20:27.679
<i>by local residents.</i>

20:27.712 --> 20:30.715
<i>It's not a coincidence.
It's karma.</i>

20:30.748 --> 20:33.451
<i>When you do evil,
evil comes back to you.</i>

20:35.320 --> 20:38.590
Okay, sensationalized bullshit.

20:41.058 --> 20:42.660
- What if she's right?
- Caitlin.

20:42.694 --> 20:46.129
I felt something
when Nathan fell.

20:50.301 --> 20:51.536
Come on, let's get some sleep.

20:52.770 --> 20:55.005
Detective Boyd wants to get
your statement in the morning.

20:59.243 --> 21:02.747
Hi. I am here
to see detective Boyd,

21:02.780 --> 21:04.349
I'm Caitlin Kramer.

21:04.382 --> 21:05.517
I'll let him know.

21:05.550 --> 21:07.117
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

21:19.264 --> 21:21.466
Hey, Shaina. Is Boyd in?

21:21.499 --> 21:23.801
- Yeah, let me get him for you.
- Thank you.

21:26.771 --> 21:27.672
Hi.

21:28.806 --> 21:30.173
- Hi.
- Uh.

21:31.576 --> 21:33.143
Sorry, I forgot your name.

21:33.176 --> 21:34.512
Uh, Caitlin.

21:34.546 --> 21:36.447
Oh, right. Lucas.

21:36.481 --> 21:37.549
It's nice to see you again.

21:39.717 --> 21:41.653
Is everything okay?

21:41.686 --> 21:42.587
Yeah.

21:43.488 --> 21:44.789
Why?

21:44.822 --> 21:46.724
Well, you're here.

21:53.130 --> 21:54.231
I'm sorry.

21:55.733 --> 21:56.834
- I...
- Sorry for what?

21:58.670 --> 22:01.306
- Uh...
- Hey, it's nice to meet you. Josh.

22:01.339 --> 22:03.106
I'm sorry about
your brother, man.

22:04.309 --> 22:05.208
Thank you.

22:06.644 --> 22:08.580
Ms. Kramer.
You can come on back.

22:09.914 --> 22:11.148
Come on in.

22:13.518 --> 22:14.719
Thanks for coming down.

22:16.287 --> 22:18.823
- Thank you for letting me in.
- You're welcome.

22:18.856 --> 22:21.659
Sergeant Boyd,
can I speak with you?

22:21.693 --> 22:22.594
I'll be right in.

22:35.238 --> 22:36.139
Hey.

22:36.173 --> 22:38.175
Hi, Tony Cusumano.

22:38.208 --> 22:40.712
- Caitlin.
- You two know each other?

22:40.745 --> 22:41.746
We met at the vigil.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.549
I was going to go,
but my wife...

22:45.483 --> 22:46.851
I haven't told her.

22:46.884 --> 22:48.118
Join the club, man.

22:49.186 --> 22:51.756
I'm Curt. And this is Maria.

22:51.789 --> 22:54.425
- I can speak for myself.
- Oh, I know that.

22:54.459 --> 22:56.661
- You never stop talking.
- God! You know what?

22:56.694 --> 22:59.162
Let's just have a little bit
of sympathy for the guy who died

22:59.196 --> 23:00.665
and the one who killed himself.

23:01.866 --> 23:03.401
I don't think he killed himself.

23:05.737 --> 23:07.305
I was at his building.

23:07.338 --> 23:08.406
When he fell.

23:10.441 --> 23:11.909
I saw somebody in his window.

23:12.977 --> 23:14.612
What are you talking about?

23:14.646 --> 23:16.314
Sir, wait.
You can't go in there.

23:19.917 --> 23:21.151
You were there.

23:24.756 --> 23:25.657
You all were.

23:27.825 --> 23:28.726
And you.

23:30.261 --> 23:31.562
You looked me
in the eyes and said

23:31.596 --> 23:32.930
that you knew
what I was going through.

23:35.633 --> 23:38.269
- Are you arresting them?
- They didn't break any laws.

23:38.302 --> 23:40.505
- They let my brother die!
- We'll catch the guy who did this.

23:40.538 --> 23:42.440
Come on. I promise, come on.

23:42.473 --> 23:43.741
Let's go, let's go to my office.

23:43.775 --> 23:45.242
How can you live
with yourselves?

23:48.312 --> 23:50.782
Great, more grief,
just what I need.

23:50.815 --> 23:54.419
All you need?
You didn't just lose a brother.

23:54.452 --> 23:56.721
- Neither did you.
- Hey, you are cold, man.

23:56.754 --> 23:59.791
- We all own a part of this.
- The guilt was killing me,

23:59.824 --> 24:02.225
okay, I saw it,
I had to do something!

24:02.260 --> 24:05.663
- Yeah, we all saw something.
- Okay.

24:05.697 --> 24:08.299
Did you ever think to call
the cops, you know, anonymously?

24:09.734 --> 24:11.602
They came to my house.

24:11.636 --> 24:13.738
Had a hell of a time
explaining that to my wife.

24:14.872 --> 24:16.307
Now you're scared to lie to her?

24:19.944 --> 24:22.013
Wha... what happened to Nathan?

24:22.046 --> 24:23.781
She said there was
someone at the window.

24:23.815 --> 24:25.783
She made a mistake.

24:25.817 --> 24:27.885
- But I saw somebody...
- We'll talk privately.

24:28.986 --> 24:32.256
I brought you all here because
media is painting you as villains.

24:32.957 --> 24:35.526
Reporters are trying
to find out who you are.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.929
So be vigilant, but this
is all going to blow over.

24:37.962 --> 24:40.598
There will be another tragedy
or scandal,

24:40.631 --> 24:42.567
and you'll be old news.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.601
We need to talk.

24:48.706 --> 24:49.674
Straight that way.

24:52.910 --> 24:55.747
Everyone here seems
to know them pretty well.

24:55.780 --> 24:57.849
We work
with the family's charity.

24:57.882 --> 25:00.952
But I didn't bring you
down here to talk about that.

25:00.985 --> 25:03.955
I know you think you saw
someone in Nathan's apartment.

25:03.988 --> 25:05.423
I did.

25:06.691 --> 25:08.326
Look.

25:08.359 --> 25:09.427
I didn't wanted to bring this up

25:09.460 --> 25:10.795
in front of the others, but...

25:11.696 --> 25:14.265
Josh told me
about your hallucinations.

25:17.735 --> 25:19.070
I know when I'm hallucinating

25:19.103 --> 25:21.706
and I know when I'm not,
I promise.

25:21.739 --> 25:23.407
It's different.

25:23.441 --> 25:24.776
There's no evidence anyone else

25:24.809 --> 25:26.611
was inside Nathan's apartment.

25:26.644 --> 25:28.546
So while I finish
this investigation,

25:28.579 --> 25:31.449
I need to be sure no one else
starts any unnecessary panic.

25:32.483 --> 25:33.951
- Understood?
- Yes!

25:35.653 --> 25:36.554
Okay.

25:40.858 --> 25:43.427
- I can't believe you told him.
- Just about the hallucinations,

25:43.461 --> 25:44.495
I didn't tell him
about everything.

25:44.529 --> 25:45.630
Oh, oh, okay,

25:45.663 --> 25:47.765
well, thank you for that.

25:47.799 --> 25:49.333
I thought you had my back, Josh.

25:49.367 --> 25:50.768
- I'm just looking out for you.
- Um.

25:50.802 --> 25:51.803
Come on, you have to know that.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.576
I'm going to go for a walk.
To clear my head.

25:58.609 --> 25:59.577
You and I can talk later.

26:04.782 --> 26:07.418
"I will bring trouble upon them,

26:07.451 --> 26:08.820
all the things they fear.

26:09.754 --> 26:13.524
For when I called out to them,
they refused to answer.

26:13.558 --> 26:15.993
And when I spoke,
they would not hear."

26:18.429 --> 26:19.463
You look lost, child.

26:21.833 --> 26:23.901
What did you say
about not hearing?

26:25.536 --> 26:28.372
God says, "Do not fear,
I will help you."

26:28.406 --> 26:31.576
He has a plan for us, you just
have to listen to the signs.

26:31.609 --> 26:34.846
Love thy Lord, thy God
with all thy heart and thy soul.

26:34.879 --> 26:36.614
And love thy neighbor
as thyself.

26:37.515 --> 26:41.686
All the answers are there.
Luke 10:27.

26:41.719 --> 26:43.855
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:10.481 --> 27:11.949
<i>Pretty amazing, huh?</i>

27:11.983 --> 27:13.584
<i>And this is just the beginning.</i>

27:13.618 --> 27:15.453
<i>Thanks to the public,
we are building</i>

27:15.486 --> 27:16.988
<i>three new homeless shelters
for battered women.</i>

27:20.825 --> 27:22.460
<i>And you let me die, Caitlin.</i>

27:23.661 --> 27:25.796
<i>You... let...</i>

27:27.198 --> 27:29.500
<i>me... die!</i>

27:41.145 --> 27:43.481
Die!

27:58.095 --> 27:59.797
Look,

27:59.830 --> 28:01.565
I know I can be
a little loose with the lips...

28:02.934 --> 28:04.201
but you know I got your back.

28:05.536 --> 28:06.737
Basically all of you.

28:11.642 --> 28:14.211
It's okay, we're good.

28:19.817 --> 28:22.553
You sure? Your face
isn't saying we're fine.

28:23.654 --> 28:25.189
I'm just a little bit
creeped out right now.

28:26.724 --> 28:28.125
So.

28:28.159 --> 28:30.761
Douglas Helton's birthday
is the same day as mine.

28:32.163 --> 28:33.464
August 27th.

28:34.865 --> 28:38.069
And I don't know why,
I just feel like it's a weird coincidence.

28:38.102 --> 28:40.705
"In the magical universe,
there are no coincidences."

28:41.706 --> 28:43.874
William S. Burroughs.
Brilliant dude.

28:43.908 --> 28:44.809
And a drug addict.

28:44.842 --> 28:46.010
And today,

28:46.043 --> 28:47.578
I ran into a street preacher,

28:47.611 --> 28:50.047
and he quoted Luke 27.

28:50.081 --> 28:54.185
- Um, it's a lot of 27s. Could be a sign.
- Yeah.

28:54.218 --> 28:56.887
- That's what I was thinking...
- Honey, I'm just kidding.

28:57.955 --> 29:00.491
If you look hard enough,
you can find signs anywhere.

29:01.259 --> 29:04.161
After all that I've been through,
can you really blame me for having faith?

29:04.195 --> 29:07.865
Of course not,
I love you for it.

29:07.898 --> 29:10.268
Just don't want you torturing
yourself over all of this.

29:34.959 --> 29:36.093
<i>Happy Birthday?</i>

29:37.295 --> 29:38.896
<i>I thought I'd start
your day off with a smile.</i>

29:40.231 --> 29:41.632
<i>Why?</i>

29:56.047 --> 29:57.148
Hello?

29:57.181 --> 29:59.150
<i>Help!</i>

30:02.354 --> 30:03.255
Hello?

30:32.716 --> 30:34.252
<i>Help me.</i>

30:45.029 --> 30:45.930
<i>Help me.</i>

31:26.770 --> 31:27.705
Hello?

32:13.817 --> 32:14.885
Help me!

32:19.823 --> 32:20.958
- Hey.
- No, help!

32:22.360 --> 32:23.328
What the hell is going on?

32:23.361 --> 32:24.828
Someone grabbed me.

32:25.963 --> 32:27.299
I don't see anyone.

32:30.868 --> 32:33.137
- Stop!
- Are you okay?

32:33.170 --> 32:35.206
- I heard you screaming.
- Where did you come from?

32:37.475 --> 32:40.844
And I've got a bruise
from where he grabbed me.

32:40.878 --> 32:43.381
He? So a man attacked you?

32:44.982 --> 32:46.717
The neighbor said
he didn't see anyone.

32:48.353 --> 32:49.987
Josh didn't see anyone either.

32:51.055 --> 32:52.390
What if it wasn't a person?

32:54.858 --> 32:56.894
I was dead
for almost three minutes.

32:56.927 --> 33:00.931
They say those who die
and come back are more sensitive

33:00.965 --> 33:03.934
or more connected
to the spiritual world.

33:03.968 --> 33:05.202
Some people believe that.

33:06.338 --> 33:08.205
But it's
the medical field's position

33:08.239 --> 33:11.942
that paranormal experience
is a symptom of psychosis.

33:13.911 --> 33:16.046
Do you think I'm psychotic?

33:16.080 --> 33:17.114
This isn't about me,

33:18.048 --> 33:19.817
this is about you

33:19.850 --> 33:21.553
and what you believe.

33:21.586 --> 33:25.022
I believe that my actions...

33:26.023 --> 33:29.126
and my choices are
coming back to haunt me.

33:33.063 --> 33:34.532
<i>My brother was a forgiving man.</i>

33:36.368 --> 33:38.503
<i>But he also believed
in accountability.</i>

33:38.536 --> 33:41.839
<i>These cowards think that
they can hide in the shadows.</i>

33:41.872 --> 33:44.041
<i>But the light of truth
is about to shine on them.</i>

33:45.377 --> 33:46.810
<i>The bad Samaritans are...</i>

33:48.313 --> 33:49.347
<i>Althea Noble...</i>

33:51.416 --> 33:54.184
<i>Maria Sanchez,</i>

33:54.218 --> 33:55.819
<i>Tony Cusumano...</i>

33:57.289 --> 33:59.023
<i>Curt Miley...</i>

33:59.056 --> 34:00.057
What the hell?

34:01.326 --> 34:03.160
<i>...Caitlin Kramer.</i>

34:05.095 --> 34:05.996
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:13.471 --> 34:14.572
<i>Who does that?</i>

34:16.641 --> 34:18.141
<i>How could that happen?</i>

34:21.945 --> 34:23.080
<i>What was he thinking about?</i>

34:29.219 --> 34:30.888
<i>Caitlin.</i>

35:12.263 --> 35:13.931
You need to be focusing
on your recovery,

35:13.964 --> 35:15.966
not going down some rabbit hole.

35:18.336 --> 35:20.137
I know you're
going through a lot.

35:20.170 --> 35:22.206
But your name is out there now,
you're not safe.

35:22.239 --> 35:24.007
Josh, I will not run.

35:31.649 --> 35:33.251
And I think
I remember something.

35:39.424 --> 35:43.595
Red, triangle. Interesting.

35:43.628 --> 35:45.929
<i>Yeah, I think it could be a, um,</i>

35:45.963 --> 35:47.699
a necklace,
or a keychain, or something.

35:47.732 --> 35:48.899
Okay.

35:50.234 --> 35:51.603
Thank you.

35:51.636 --> 35:53.304
That guy,

35:53.338 --> 35:54.339
I think I saw...

35:55.573 --> 35:56.608
Saw what?

35:58.075 --> 35:59.009
Nothing.

36:00.177 --> 36:02.347
I'm just a little worried h...

36:02.380 --> 36:04.716
he's out there
and now he knows who we are.

36:04.749 --> 36:07.352
We've got everyone
working this case,

36:07.385 --> 36:09.086
we haven't caught the guy,

36:09.119 --> 36:10.622
<i>but we found
a pair of black gloves</i>

36:10.655 --> 36:13.023
<i>in the garbage can by the park.</i>

36:13.056 --> 36:14.559
Forensics is running the DNA.

36:16.226 --> 36:17.729
I'll keep you updated.

36:17.762 --> 36:20.465
<i>Call me if you think
of anything else.</i>

36:20.498 --> 36:22.232
Yeah, I will.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.167
Have a good night.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.008
What are you doing?

36:31.041 --> 36:32.310
At the station,

36:32.343 --> 36:34.044
Curt said,
"We all saw something."

36:35.012 --> 36:37.615
What if we saw something that
separately doesn't mean anything,

36:37.649 --> 36:40.485
but together can help us
find the man who killed Douglas.

36:40.518 --> 36:42.554
Well, if you have a theory,
tell the police.

36:42.587 --> 36:44.289
But they're
not going to believe me,

36:44.322 --> 36:46.558
not without proof.
I have to talk to the others.

36:46.591 --> 36:48.560
No, you need
to stay here and calm down.

36:48.593 --> 36:50.060
Calm down?

36:51.228 --> 36:53.631
I have an opportunity
to make this right.

36:54.566 --> 36:56.200
If you don't want
to help me, fine,

36:56.233 --> 36:57.335
but stay out of my way.

37:14.719 --> 37:16.421
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:18.423 --> 37:20.558
At least you're not
another one of those reporters.

37:21.559 --> 37:22.460
Come on in.

37:26.698 --> 37:29.367
- Want a drink?
- No, no, I'm good.

37:30.702 --> 37:32.202
I hate drinking alone.

37:34.472 --> 37:35.440
My wife left me.

37:38.141 --> 37:39.377
See how long that lasts.

37:49.454 --> 37:50.455
What are you doing here?

37:52.624 --> 37:54.726
I want to talk to you
about the park.

37:54.759 --> 37:56.561
Jesus, I'm tired
of talking about it,

37:56.594 --> 37:59.464
- tired of thinking about it.
- Okay, okay, I understand.

38:01.633 --> 38:04.201
But I have to ask you.

38:07.272 --> 38:08.273
Have you...

38:09.206 --> 38:12.777
...experienced anything
strange lately?

38:13.845 --> 38:18.516
- Strange like?
- Like, have you seen anything weird?

38:19.751 --> 38:23.454
Or felt like
you're being attacked?

38:27.592 --> 38:29.126
Hey,
you want to know how I feel?

38:30.461 --> 38:32.630
When I think about
what I did to my family...

38:34.231 --> 38:35.132
to Maria...

38:36.066 --> 38:37.702
what happened
to that guy at the park...

38:38.703 --> 38:41.104
I feel like shit, okay?

38:43.308 --> 38:45.242
And I want to stop
feeling anything.

38:47.579 --> 38:48.613
Anything at all.

38:55.553 --> 38:56.588
What the hell?

39:12.537 --> 39:13.671
Has that happened before?

39:13.705 --> 39:15.373
No.

39:15.406 --> 39:17.308
Birds usually don't crash
into my window.

39:27.819 --> 39:29.587
Why the hell are you here?

39:29.621 --> 39:33.190
At the station,
you said, we all saw something.

39:33.223 --> 39:35.426
Yeah, we saw a guy getting
the crap beat out of him.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.894
How about since then?

39:38.463 --> 39:40.197
- Like what?
- Like...

39:43.334 --> 39:44.369
Douglas.

39:46.203 --> 39:47.472
- Get out.
- I promise,

39:47.505 --> 39:49.172
- you can tell me if you've see...
- Get out!

41:42.754 --> 41:46.691
- Hello?
- Hey, Curt? It's Caitlin.

41:46.724 --> 41:48.659
I ca... I can't hear you,
I'm, I'm in the basement.

41:48.693 --> 41:51.395
I'm sorry, I'm just calling
to make sure everything is okay.

41:51.429 --> 41:53.464
Ho... Hold on.

42:01.472 --> 42:04.041
<i>Curt? Curt?</i>

42:05.376 --> 42:06.611
<i>Hey, Curt?</i>

42:06.644 --> 42:08.012
<i>Help me.</i>

42:35.406 --> 42:36.307
Curt.

42:43.648 --> 42:44.882
I called the police.

42:46.684 --> 42:48.019
They'll be here in any minute.

42:51.522 --> 42:52.423
Curt.

43:02.767 --> 43:03.668
Curt!

43:12.510 --> 43:13.411
Curt?

43:29.527 --> 43:30.494
Oh, my God.

43:36.701 --> 43:38.703
Hey, hey! It's okay.

43:42.506 --> 43:44.909
<i>The story about
the attack in Bristol Park</i>

43:44.942 --> 43:47.011
<i>has taken another twist.</i>

43:47.044 --> 43:50.114
<i>Curt Miley
was found dead last night.</i>

43:50.147 --> 43:52.450
<i>He's the second witness
to the brutal assault</i>

43:52.483 --> 43:55.653
<i>to die mysteriously
and everyone is asking:</i>

43:55.686 --> 43:58.890
<i>Is this just a coincidence
or something more?</i>

43:58.923 --> 44:00.892
<i>Our phone lines
have been burning up.</i>

44:00.925 --> 44:02.159
<i>I saw the video.</i>

44:02.193 --> 44:04.161
<i>It's disgusting. If you ask me,</i>

44:04.195 --> 44:06.063
<i>they're getting
what's coming to them.</i>

44:06.097 --> 44:07.999
<i>If I saw one of them in trouble,</i>

44:08.032 --> 44:10.001
<i>I would do exactly
what they did.</i>

44:10.034 --> 44:11.669
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

44:11.702 --> 44:13.104
<i>They're just a bunch of cowards</i>

44:13.137 --> 44:14.438
<i>and they get to go on
with their lives</i>

44:14.472 --> 44:15.439
<i>while that poor guy is dead.</i>

44:15.473 --> 44:16.707
<i>It's not fair.</i>

44:16.741 --> 44:17.808
<i>And if law don't do</i>

44:17.842 --> 44:19.176
<i>something to these people,</i>

44:19.210 --> 44:20.745
<i>can you really be surprised</i>

44:20.778 --> 44:22.013

44:22.046 --> 44:22.947

44:25.082 --> 44:26.717
<i>If I were them,</i>

44:26.751 --> 44:27.985

44:28.019 --> 44:30.187
<i>This isn't a coincidence.</i>

44:30.221 --> 44:32.957
<i>People get

44:32.990 --> 44:34.959
<i>One way or the other,</i>

44:34.992 --> 44:38.095
<i>you can't escape karma.</i>

44:41.933 --> 44:43.901
A crow flew into his window,

44:44.835 --> 44:46.771
you know a crow
is a sign of death, right?

44:46.804 --> 44:48.706
All right, listen,
after last night,

44:48.739 --> 44:50.841
I can't deny something weird
is definitely going on...

44:52.176 --> 44:53.644
but I don't know what
you want to find here.

44:53.678 --> 44:54.645
Answers.

44:57.915 --> 45:01.218
The death of this righteous man,

45:01.253 --> 45:02.520
is on every tongue.

45:04.221 --> 45:06.757
But this story isn't new.

45:07.959 --> 45:09.894
It goes back,

45:09.927 --> 45:12.630
back to the tale

45:12.663 --> 45:14.065
of the Good Samaritan.

45:14.098 --> 45:16.968
Now, Jesus never said

45:17.001 --> 45:19.603
that this was a parable.

45:19.637 --> 45:20.538
So...

45:21.706 --> 45:26.877
it is possible that he
was describing an actual event.

45:26.911 --> 45:31.749
The story teaches us
lessons of compassion.

45:33.784 --> 45:35.886
It's right in front of you.

45:36.854 --> 45:38.923
Right in front of you

45:38.956 --> 45:42.526
if you choose to see it.

45:42.560 --> 45:45.529
Luke, chapter ten.

45:46.731 --> 45:48.032
It is a story

45:48.065 --> 45:49.667
about a treacherous road

45:49.700 --> 45:53.237
that leads
from Jericho to Jerusalem

45:53.271 --> 45:56.540
that is known
as "The Way of Blood."

46:14.759 --> 46:15.926
Caitlin.

46:18.763 --> 46:19.930
What are you doing here?

46:21.699 --> 46:23.134
- Josh! Josh.
- You put her name out there, man?

46:23.167 --> 46:24.702
- You put her life in danger.
- That's enough.

46:24.735 --> 46:26.804
- Please.
- God.

46:26.837 --> 46:29.573
Lucas, I am so sorry

46:29.607 --> 46:31.208
about not helping your brother,

46:31.242 --> 46:32.710
for everything.

46:32.743 --> 46:35.012
Why would you come here?
Of all places.

46:35.046 --> 46:36.281
I didn't know
this is your church.

46:36.314 --> 46:37.948
So this is just a coincidence?

46:40.918 --> 46:42.920
- No. No, it's not.
- Caitlin, honey...

46:42.953 --> 46:44.155
Then why are you here?

46:45.656 --> 46:48.225
I have seen things
and felt things

46:48.260 --> 46:51.695
since that day in the park, and I thought
coming here would make sense of it all.

46:53.298 --> 46:54.799
What are you talking about?

46:56.133 --> 46:57.668
It's hard to explain.

47:00.405 --> 47:02.106
I keep seeing the number 27.

47:03.774 --> 47:06.243
Douglas and I,
we were both born on the 27th,

47:06.278 --> 47:09.347
and that quote has a 27.

47:09.381 --> 47:14.585
And I've felt this presence.

47:19.090 --> 47:21.393
You mean, like,
Douglas's presence?

47:21.426 --> 47:22.327
Yeah.

47:29.066 --> 47:29.967
I felt it too.

47:32.203 --> 47:34.238
- You have?
- Yeah.

47:36.140 --> 47:37.708
And I think I've seen Doug.

47:37.741 --> 47:39.043
A glimpse in the crowd,

47:39.076 --> 47:41.011
a figure out of the corner
of my eye.

47:41.045 --> 47:42.980
My doctor said it was,
it was just my mind

47:43.013 --> 47:44.282
trying to process the loss.

47:45.816 --> 47:46.951
I thought I was going crazy.

47:47.918 --> 47:48.853
Um...

47:50.255 --> 47:53.291
I should go,
but can we meet later?

47:53.325 --> 47:54.859
Caitlin, no. Come on. Let's go.

47:55.826 --> 47:57.295
At least let me give you
my phone number.

47:57.329 --> 47:58.330
In case you change your mind.

48:07.305 --> 48:08.239
Thank you.

48:15.913 --> 48:19.251
I went there for an answer.
And I found one.

48:20.151 --> 48:21.986
I'm... I'm not imagining this,

48:22.019 --> 48:23.888
Lucas felt it too.

48:23.921 --> 48:25.156
He saw his brother!

48:25.189 --> 48:26.291
When my mom died,

48:26.324 --> 48:28.025
I thought I saw her everywhere.

48:28.058 --> 48:29.894
Yeah, Josh, I get that.

48:29.927 --> 48:32.096
But I'm telling you,
this is different.

48:39.170 --> 48:40.070
I love you.

48:50.881 --> 48:52.016
And I love you too.

48:56.954 --> 48:57.855
What?

48:59.524 --> 49:01.725
It's Lucas. He says he wants

49:01.759 --> 49:03.461
- to meet with me.
- No, no, that's not a good idea.

49:03.495 --> 49:05.129
Well, I have to tell him
what's been happening.

49:05.162 --> 49:06.331
He's just going
to feed your paranoia.

49:06.364 --> 49:08.300
Josh, this isn't paranoia.

49:08.333 --> 49:10.100
No, it's worse,
don't you get it?

49:10.134 --> 49:12.236
You went to Curt's house
that night, alone.

49:12.270 --> 49:14.238
Whoever killed him,
they could've killed you too.

49:15.172 --> 49:17.241
Look, babe, I love you,

49:17.275 --> 49:20.177
but I, I can't just sit by and
watch you spiral out of control.

49:20.211 --> 49:22.447
I am in control.

49:22.480 --> 49:24.848
For the first time
in a long time.

49:27.785 --> 49:30.522
- Okay, I'm going to call Gateways...
- No.

49:30.555 --> 49:32.823
I don't need Gateways,

49:32.856 --> 49:34.191
and I don't need you
doubting me.

49:34.225 --> 49:36.727
Okay? Not now.

49:40.164 --> 49:41.065
Caitlin.

49:42.166 --> 49:43.067
Caitlin!

49:51.543 --> 49:55.313
- Hi. Uh, I am Caitlin...
- I know who you are.

49:55.347 --> 49:56.780
You don't have an appointment.

49:56.814 --> 49:58.082
And you got some nerve

49:58.115 --> 49:59.551
showing your face around here.

49:59.584 --> 50:02.086
It's okay, Betty. I got this.

50:06.156 --> 50:07.057
Come with me.

50:14.366 --> 50:15.766
This was Doug's next project.

50:16.900 --> 50:19.169
Buy abandoned buildings,
converting them into shelters.

50:22.607 --> 50:23.841
Let's go.

50:35.353 --> 50:36.854
Curt said he saw something.

50:38.188 --> 50:41.359
But when I asked him
about Douglas, he got defensive.

50:41.393 --> 50:44.228
In your experience,
did you just see something,

50:44.262 --> 50:47.231
or did you feel
some sort of physical contact?

50:49.334 --> 50:51.303
Before we talk about that,
I need to say something.

50:52.337 --> 50:54.506
I'm really trying
to keep forgiveness in my heart

50:54.539 --> 50:55.507
for you and the others.

50:56.608 --> 50:57.509
But I need to know...

50:59.943 --> 51:00.911
why didn't you help him?

51:06.351 --> 51:08.085
There hasn't been
a day that has gone by

51:08.118 --> 51:10.087
that I haven't agonized
over that morning.

51:12.056 --> 51:13.891
The thought... What if I...

51:16.661 --> 51:19.163
When I told you
that I lost my father...

51:21.098 --> 51:22.400
I was telling the truth.

51:23.967 --> 51:26.338
About nine months ago.

51:28.440 --> 51:30.342
Some people
broke into our house...

51:32.910 --> 51:34.312
and they shot my dad.

51:37.582 --> 51:38.882
We both died.

51:41.286 --> 51:43.655
And they were able
to bring me back.

51:43.688 --> 51:45.956
But not him.

51:49.294 --> 51:50.194
And...

51:52.129 --> 51:53.864
...I blamed myself...

51:55.367 --> 51:56.867
I had a breakdown, I...

52:00.204 --> 52:04.108
So that day in the park,
when I saw your brother being attacked,

52:04.141 --> 52:05.510
I went back to that morning...

52:07.345 --> 52:08.446
and I froze.

52:13.518 --> 52:17.322
All I can say
is that I was weak.

52:20.224 --> 52:22.192
And scared.

52:22.226 --> 52:24.629
I am so sorry.

52:41.245 --> 52:42.480
Thank you.

52:49.587 --> 52:52.323
Well, I spent the afternoon
researching spirits.

52:54.459 --> 52:57.429
And I can't believe I just said that.

52:57.462 --> 53:00.565
I mean, I'm kind of spiritual,

53:00.598 --> 53:03.468
I was sort of going
to church when Douglas died.

53:03.501 --> 53:07.338
Mostly for the "reap what you sow"
sermons, which is kind of like karma.

53:08.473 --> 53:10.408
What you do comes back on you.

53:12.075 --> 53:13.511
Well, karma is a force.

53:14.746 --> 53:16.381
Which means it can use people,

53:17.315 --> 53:19.350
but it can also use things.

53:19.384 --> 53:20.485
Like spirits.

53:21.653 --> 53:24.188
Well,
this says what they all say.

53:25.155 --> 53:26.624
If someone dies violently,

53:26.658 --> 53:28.326
a part of them
can remain in our world,

53:28.359 --> 53:31.362
like a trace or an echo,

53:31.396 --> 53:33.765
- until they're avenged.
- Oh, my God.

53:33.798 --> 53:37.067
- What?
- Wait, you know how I keep seeing the number 27?

53:37.100 --> 53:38.001
- Yeah.
- Look.

53:40.605 --> 53:42.607
What... what does that mean?

53:42.640 --> 53:44.542
I think it means
we're on the right path.

53:46.778 --> 53:49.046
You said you thought
Curt may have seen something

53:49.079 --> 53:50.715
- in the park, right?
- Yeah.

53:50.748 --> 53:51.982
What about the others?

53:52.983 --> 53:55.420
You're right.
That is what I need to find out.

53:58.523 --> 53:59.791
Is there anything
else that you remember?

53:59.824 --> 54:01.659
I told the cops
everything I know.

54:01.693 --> 54:04.094
- Are you sure? Maybe you forgot something.
- Yes.

54:05.497 --> 54:09.066
Is this... is this why you
brought us all down here? Huh?

54:09.099 --> 54:11.235
Have you guys experienced
anything weird

54:11.269 --> 54:12.704
since Douglas died?

54:12.737 --> 54:15.573
Could you be
a lot more specific?

54:15.607 --> 54:17.709
Like,
have you felt something ominous,

54:17.742 --> 54:19.277
like a presence?

54:21.111 --> 54:24.582
I know it sounds weird, but I've felt
something since that day in the park.

54:24.616 --> 54:26.484
- Lucas has too.
- Lucas?

54:26.518 --> 54:28.118
Why are you talking to him?
He hates us.

54:28.151 --> 54:30.555
No, no, he doesn't,
and he is really sorry

54:30.588 --> 54:33.791
- for the press conference.
- Sorry? Sorry is not going to bring back Curt.

54:39.564 --> 54:42.199
I don't know what is going on with you
two, but leave us out of it.

54:42.232 --> 54:44.636
I had to take Jesse
out of school after that.

54:44.669 --> 54:47.272
You know, you're going to have
to stop living in the past,

54:47.305 --> 54:49.374
and figure out a way
to put this to rest.

54:49.407 --> 54:52.410
Like I did. You're going
to drive yourself crazy.

54:59.551 --> 55:00.451
Hello?

55:02.253 --> 55:03.153
Yes?

55:05.290 --> 55:06.189
Hi.

55:11.296 --> 55:13.598
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be there in a second.

55:19.236 --> 55:20.203
Are you ready?

55:22.440 --> 55:23.575
Okay.

55:30.882 --> 55:31.849
Is that him?

55:35.920 --> 55:36.854
Yeah, that is him.

55:40.157 --> 55:41.091
You sure?

55:43.294 --> 55:45.597
Yeah, that is him.

55:46.798 --> 55:47.699
Okay.

55:48.600 --> 55:49.500
Let's go.

55:54.204 --> 55:56.441
<i>Caitlin.</i>

56:11.489 --> 56:12.857
- You okay?
- Yeah.

56:21.265 --> 56:24.167
Listen, I know words,
they don't mean much,

56:24.902 --> 56:26.604
but about your brother,

56:26.638 --> 56:27.772
I am sorry.

56:29.307 --> 56:30.742
We've all done things we regret.

56:31.876 --> 56:34.479
I shouldn't have gone public
with your names,

56:34.512 --> 56:35.513
put you in danger.

56:40.718 --> 56:41.786
It's our guy.

56:44.455 --> 56:45.423
Who is he?

56:45.456 --> 56:46.491
Mark Gaddis,

56:46.524 --> 56:47.625
he had a long record.

56:47.659 --> 56:49.761
Robbery, assault, possession.

56:49.794 --> 56:52.397
Cleaning crew
found his body in an alley.

56:52.430 --> 56:54.532
Looks like a drug overdose.

56:54.565 --> 56:57.335
That medallion you saw
was from a 12 step program.

56:58.803 --> 57:00.638
Why did he kill my brother?

57:00.672 --> 57:03.274
Uh, we found a Chapel Care card
in his pocket.

57:04.241 --> 57:06.544
Think he might've known Douglas
from one of these shelters.

57:06.577 --> 57:08.346
Followed him
into the park to rob him.

57:09.514 --> 57:11.616
He saw you all on the news,

57:11.649 --> 57:13.484
got worried
you could identify him.

57:13.518 --> 57:14.752
I am so sorry.

57:18.289 --> 57:19.189
So that is it?

57:19.891 --> 57:21.959
- It's over?
- Yeah.

57:21.993 --> 57:23.327
Thank God.

57:24.495 --> 57:25.463
Wait, I don't...

57:26.998 --> 57:29.000
I don't think
he killed Nathan and Curt.

57:29.033 --> 57:30.902
Please, stop it.

57:32.870 --> 57:33.771
Let's talk.

57:42.480 --> 57:44.749
- What is the matter?
- I know that guy killed Douglas,

57:44.782 --> 57:47.719
- but I still...
- Caitlin, this whole "reap what you sow" thing, I get it.

57:48.619 --> 57:50.822
Think about it rationally.

57:50.855 --> 57:52.757
If there really is
some kind of karmic justice

57:52.790 --> 57:54.425
going on here,
it shouldn't affect you.

57:55.727 --> 57:58.362
You froze because of your past.

57:58.396 --> 57:59.664
That is how karma works, right?

58:00.565 --> 58:01.632
Your intentions?

58:03.301 --> 58:04.302
You helped him.

58:04.335 --> 58:05.970
You called the police.

58:06.003 --> 58:07.405
It's over.

58:10.908 --> 58:12.376
The black gloves.

58:13.511 --> 58:16.547
- What?
- When I called

58:16.581 --> 58:18.850
about the medallion
the guy was carrying,

58:18.883 --> 58:21.352
you said they found
black gloves in the trash can.

58:22.053 --> 58:24.789
I never told you the killer
was wearing black gloves.

58:26.924 --> 58:28.326
Althea told me.

58:29.827 --> 58:31.529
Look,
I know you're scared, but...

58:32.730 --> 58:34.899
don't go looking for trouble
where there isn't any.

58:38.436 --> 58:39.670
You need a ride home?

58:40.705 --> 58:43.040
No. No, I'm good.

59:05.930 --> 59:08.933
- Hey.
- Where have you been? I've been calling you all day.

59:08.966 --> 59:11.068
I'm sorry
for running out on you.

59:12.470 --> 59:14.605
It's okay. Are you home?

59:14.639 --> 59:15.540
Yeah.

59:16.507 --> 59:17.775
I'll be there in ten minutes.

59:18.776 --> 59:19.677
Okay.

59:20.678 --> 59:21.579
Thank you.

59:23.514 --> 59:24.448
<i>I love you, Caitlin.</i>

59:25.716 --> 59:26.751
I love you too.

59:36.127 --> 59:37.995
Jesus.

59:42.967 --> 59:44.502
- Hello.
- It's Maria.

59:45.503 --> 59:48.339
Cait...
I'm really sorry about earlier.

59:50.007 --> 59:52.410
<i>It's just, I've been
a wreck since Curt died.</i>

59:53.644 --> 59:55.947
Did they, um...

59:55.980 --> 59:58.449
...did they find the guy
who killed Douglas?

59:59.684 --> 01:00:01.385
Yeah.

01:00:01.419 --> 01:00:04.422
They think he killed
Nathan and Curt too.

01:00:05.623 --> 01:00:06.624
He didn't.

01:00:08.492 --> 01:00:10.895
Maria? What is wrong?

01:00:16.634 --> 01:00:18.669
I saw Douglas.

01:00:19.804 --> 01:00:20.705
Are you sure?

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.908
You saw him?

01:00:23.941 --> 01:00:26.611
<i>Yeah. And, um,</i>

01:00:26.644 --> 01:00:27.879
Curt and me...

01:00:32.116 --> 01:00:35.920
we saw something
at the park that day.

01:00:36.954 --> 01:00:38.055
Where are you?

01:00:48.666 --> 01:00:49.567
Maria?

01:01:39.251 --> 01:01:40.252
Maria?

01:02:08.179 --> 01:02:11.048
I was on your side,
all this time.

01:02:11.082 --> 01:02:13.684
But you have a habit
of turning up when people die.

01:02:13.718 --> 01:02:15.820
One time I can write off
as a coincidence.

01:02:15.853 --> 01:02:17.788
Twice I get suspicious.
Three times...

01:02:18.756 --> 01:02:20.057
Well, no one is that unlucky.

01:02:20.091 --> 01:02:21.926
So you need to be
straight with me now.

01:02:21.959 --> 01:02:23.494
You think I did this?

01:02:24.895 --> 01:02:26.230
Why?

01:02:26.264 --> 01:02:28.766
Maybe guilt?

01:02:28.799 --> 01:02:30.768
Maybe, in some twisted way,

01:02:30.801 --> 01:02:32.103
you think you're
making things right?

01:02:32.136 --> 01:02:34.005
No, no, no, no. Talk to Lucas,

01:02:34.038 --> 01:02:36.841
- he's seen his brother too.
- He thinks he's seen him.

01:02:36.874 --> 01:02:40.711
That guy is going through hell and you're
filling his head with, with ghost stories.

01:02:40.745 --> 01:02:41.946
Are you arresting me?

01:02:41.979 --> 01:02:43.781
Not yet.

01:02:43.814 --> 01:02:46.550
But CSI is going
over the crime scene.

01:02:46.584 --> 01:02:48.219
Don't think about leaving town.

01:02:48.253 --> 01:02:50.688
And stay away
from the other witnesses.

01:02:52.056 --> 01:02:54.892
We're putting them
under 24-hour surveillance.

01:02:54.925 --> 01:02:58.095
You go near them,
I'll lock you up myself.

01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.964
Is that clear?

01:03:02.867 --> 01:03:03.768
Get out of here.

01:03:51.383 --> 01:03:53.150
What are you doing?

01:03:53.184 --> 01:03:55.619
Sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:03:57.988 --> 01:04:00.392
- Maria is dead.
- What?

01:04:00.425 --> 01:04:03.794
- But I... I thought they found the guy.
- No, I told you, it wasn't him.

01:04:04.695 --> 01:04:07.098
Okay, well, you're
staying with me tonight.

01:04:07.131 --> 01:04:10.302
- And no arguing, okay? Your life is in danger.
- Okay, okay, fine.

01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:16.140
Wait, how did you know
that I'd be here?

01:04:17.442 --> 01:04:19.944
Uh, Boyd called.

01:04:19.977 --> 01:04:23.080
Said he brought you in
for questions. Why?

01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:29.220
Caitlin, what's wrong?

01:04:29.254 --> 01:04:30.721
I, uh...

01:04:30.754 --> 01:04:32.823
Caitlin, you're...
you're being silly.

01:04:34.892 --> 01:04:36.760
- I, uh...
- Caitlin, open the door.

01:04:36.794 --> 01:04:38.229
Caitlin, come on, open the door.

01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:46.170
Okay, I will go get my car.

01:04:47.705 --> 01:04:48.706
Wait for me.

01:04:53.311 --> 01:04:55.413
<i>Caitlin.</i>

01:06:25.537 --> 01:06:26.870
Oh, my God!

01:06:31.041 --> 01:06:32.310
Oh!

01:06:55.232 --> 01:06:56.200
Althea?

01:06:58.002 --> 01:06:58.902
Althea.

01:07:00.204 --> 01:07:01.972
Althea. Hey. Hey.

01:07:03.107 --> 01:07:05.477
Althea. What happened?

01:07:06.578 --> 01:07:07.878
Was it Douglas?

01:07:09.381 --> 01:07:11.383
No, no.

01:07:22.226 --> 01:07:26.096
<i>Love thy god with all thy heart and thy soul.</i>

01:07:27.131 --> 01:07:29.467
<i>And love thy neighbor as thy self.</i>

01:07:32.002 --> 01:07:34.506
The signs are real,
they're real.

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.009
Twenty-seven.

01:07:39.043 --> 01:07:40.478
I thought it was a bible verse.

01:07:40.512 --> 01:07:42.212
The answers are all there.

01:07:42.246 --> 01:07:47.117
Right in front of you,
if you choose to see it.

01:07:47.151 --> 01:07:48.852
But it was the chapter.

01:07:48.886 --> 01:07:50.888
You know crows are
a sign of death, right?

01:07:51.656 --> 01:07:55.926
The book of Luke.

01:08:02.267 --> 01:08:03.568
You said you saw him.

01:08:04.636 --> 01:08:06.371
You lied.

01:08:06.404 --> 01:08:07.905
Help me.

01:08:11.276 --> 01:08:12.477
I know you're angry...

01:08:14.446 --> 01:08:16.514
- I know loss.
- Loss?

01:08:20.216 --> 01:08:21.885
You had a lifetime
with your father.

01:08:23.087 --> 01:08:23.987
Our dad?

01:08:25.089 --> 01:08:27.124
He abandoned us
when we were kids.

01:08:27.157 --> 01:08:28.426
Mom drank herself to death.

01:08:30.027 --> 01:08:33.063
We ended up alone,
on the streets.

01:08:33.096 --> 01:08:34.865
Do you know what happens
to kids out there?

01:08:40.037 --> 01:08:41.238
Doug protected me.

01:08:43.107 --> 01:08:44.642
When I wanted
to give up and check out

01:08:44.676 --> 01:08:47.010
of this miserable life,
he kept me going.

01:08:47.044 --> 01:08:48.946
He was everything to me.

01:08:48.979 --> 01:08:50.314
I'm so sorry.

01:08:55.620 --> 01:08:58.656
Killing us won't bring him back.

01:09:00.392 --> 01:09:03.127
I haven't killed anyone,
you did.

01:09:05.996 --> 01:09:06.997
Murder.

01:09:08.031 --> 01:09:09.434
Suicide.

01:09:09.466 --> 01:09:11.100
This?

01:09:11.135 --> 01:09:13.069
This is the gun
you shot Maria with.

01:09:13.103 --> 01:09:14.238
- No.
- Yes.

01:09:15.205 --> 01:09:18.175
I had her call you,
lure you to the salon

01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:21.379
just like I brought you
to Chapel City Cares.

01:09:21.412 --> 01:09:23.481
So you could see
the buildings we're buying.

01:09:23.515 --> 01:09:24.416
This one.

01:09:26.751 --> 01:09:29.587
It's a perfect place
for you to end it all.

01:09:29.621 --> 01:09:31.456
The signs were protecting me...

01:09:32.557 --> 01:09:33.457
from danger.

01:09:34.626 --> 01:09:37.227
- From you.
- You're pathetic.

01:09:37.261 --> 01:09:40.532
You are so desperate to believe
that there is something

01:09:40.564 --> 01:09:42.634
greater at work out there,

01:09:42.667 --> 01:09:43.600
when all there is...

01:09:44.836 --> 01:09:47.439
is a world filled with rotten selfish people...

01:09:47.471 --> 01:09:50.006
...who think they can do whatever
they want and not pay the price.

01:09:51.609 --> 01:09:52.676
If karma is real...

01:09:54.178 --> 01:09:55.713
it screwed you all over good.

01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:00.083
You going to talk us to death?

01:10:01.419 --> 01:10:04.054
Or are you going
to man up and do something?

01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:06.691
All right.

01:10:06.724 --> 01:10:08.726
What you s...

01:10:10.462 --> 01:10:11.629
Caitlin!

01:10:13.465 --> 01:10:14.599
Running again?

01:10:15.667 --> 01:10:18.235
You can't shoot me and frame me.

01:10:18.269 --> 01:10:21.639
Pull the trigger, I get away,
your plan goes to hell.

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:21.733
Caitlin.

01:11:32.242 --> 01:11:33.143
Please.

01:11:34.746 --> 01:11:37.047
Please.

01:11:41.719 --> 01:11:44.789
Help! Please help me!

01:11:51.228 --> 01:11:54.499
- Caitlin!
- Stop! Please!

01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:56.801
God, help me.

01:11:56.834 --> 01:11:58.369
God won't save you.

01:11:59.337 --> 01:12:01.639
There are no signs, no karma.

01:12:02.774 --> 01:12:03.841
It's just you and me.

01:13:11.676 --> 01:13:13.143
Don't make me shoot.

01:13:54.419 --> 01:13:55.653
You're a fighter.

01:13:57.889 --> 01:14:00.558
- You're a lucky lady.
- It wasn't luck.

01:14:04.829 --> 01:14:05.930
I wasn't alone in there.

01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:19.977
<i>Okay, fine, you can keep
the key if it makes you feel better.</i>

01:14:20.011 --> 01:14:22.413
Who is that?

01:14:33.691 --> 01:14:34.992
We need to go.

01:14:36.694 --> 01:14:38.563
No, we don't.

01:14:38.596 --> 01:14:39.497
But...

01:14:40.932 --> 01:14:42.600
Those guys there, um...

01:14:45.403 --> 01:14:46.971
- They're going to...
- I know.

01:14:48.673 --> 01:14:49.640
It's okay.

01:15:04.455 --> 01:15:05.990
I miss you so much.

01:15:11.028 --> 01:15:12.697
I'm so sorry.

01:15:14.632 --> 01:15:17.368
Sweetheart,
this wasn't your fault.

01:15:20.104 --> 01:15:21.339
I love you.

01:15:23.808 --> 01:15:25.643
I love you too.

01:15:38.623 --> 01:15:40.925
Answer the door, sweetheart.

01:16:52.997 --> 01:16:54.065
How is it going?

01:16:56.901 --> 01:16:59.003
Oh, that is right.

01:16:59.036 --> 01:17:00.471
You can't talk.

01:17:01.672 --> 01:17:02.673
Or walk.

01:17:04.642 --> 01:17:06.110
Tough break, huh?

01:17:15.186 --> 01:17:19.457
You think you were justified
on what you did? Huh?

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:21.959
Avenging Chapel City's saint?

01:17:23.594 --> 01:17:25.563
Let me tell you something...

01:17:27.531 --> 01:17:29.133
your brother wasn't no saint.

01:17:31.836 --> 01:17:34.739
I stayed in one of his shelters
when I lost my house.

01:17:36.173 --> 01:17:38.776
And he promised
to take care of me.

01:17:40.611 --> 01:17:41.545
One night...

01:17:42.546 --> 01:17:44.048
he came into my bedroom.

01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:46.083
And he said...

01:17:47.252 --> 01:17:49.987
"If you don't want to be
on the streets with your boy...

01:17:53.524 --> 01:17:54.959
shut your mouth...

01:17:55.893 --> 01:17:57.561
and do what I say."

01:17:59.063 --> 01:18:00.665
I wasn't the only one.

01:18:02.533 --> 01:18:03.768
You were right.

01:18:04.902 --> 01:18:07.772
You said people got to own up
to their own actions.

01:18:10.841 --> 01:18:11.742
I found a guy.

01:18:14.011 --> 01:18:17.481
It's amazing
what people would do for $200.

01:18:18.616 --> 01:18:21.185
See, I wasn't just
in the park that day for a walk.

01:18:23.187 --> 01:18:27.491
I was there to see
your brother get what he deserved.

01:18:27.525 --> 01:18:28.225
I...

01:18:29.727 --> 01:18:31.228
I didn't mean for him to die.

01:18:33.864 --> 01:18:35.199
I told the guy just...

01:18:36.133 --> 01:18:37.201
just rough him up a bit.

01:18:39.704 --> 01:18:42.206
You think all these people
would hate us if they knew

01:18:42.239 --> 01:18:44.208
what kind of man he really was?

01:18:45.609 --> 01:18:46.644
Would you?

01:18:48.913 --> 01:18:53.651
You and your misguided
vengeance.

01:18:55.619 --> 01:18:57.221
You see where it got you?

01:19:00.224 --> 01:19:01.759
Paralyzed.

01:19:03.661 --> 01:19:05.162
And locked up for life.

01:19:08.866 --> 01:19:09.834
I guess it's true.

01:19:12.136 --> 01:19:14.605
Karma really is a bitch.

01:19:35.693 --> 01:19:37.528
<i>Lucas.</i>

01:19:40.064 --> 01:19:41.098
<i>Help me.</i>

01:20:01.845 --> 01:20:06.845
