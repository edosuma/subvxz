WEBVTT

00:16.084 --> 00:18.252
Terra Nova H.Q., this is Foster.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.390
I just pulled up

00:22.423 --> 00:24.492
at communications relay station
19-A.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.395
Copy that. Commence repair.
Roger that.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.371
Smithson, is that you?

00:37.405 --> 00:40.040
You sleeping off another bender
in there,

00:40.074 --> 00:42.410
or did you lock
yourself in again?

00:51.685 --> 00:53.121
Smithson, wake up.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.389
Smithson?

01:17.311 --> 01:18.955
Yeah, it looks pretty straight
forward happened here to me.

01:18.979 --> 01:22.216
Foster made the mistake of leaving
the shed door open while he was working.

01:22.250 --> 01:26.053
Must have snuck up behind him.
Never saw it coming.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.688
What did it to him?

01:27.721 --> 01:30.191
Nykoraptor. Bite marks on the
torso were a dead giveaway.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.792
They've got three rows
of incisors.

01:31.825 --> 01:35.796
Nykos are vicious.
Basically two-legged sharks.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.531
Easy with him.

01:37.565 --> 01:40.734
Do they hunt around here?

01:40.768 --> 01:43.704
No, no, not usually.
But these Ankylosaur nests...

01:43.737 --> 01:46.140
- Their eggs are easy prey.
- With easy prey nearby,

01:46.174 --> 01:47.641
why'd the Nyko go after a human?

01:47.675 --> 01:49.186
You got an endless
supply of chicken...

01:49.210 --> 01:50.454
Doesn't mean you're going to
turn your nose up

01:50.478 --> 01:52.313
at a bloody rare steak.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.899
Good morning, Josh.

02:45.933 --> 02:49.237
I need to talk to you for a sec
about our arrangement.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.171
There's been
a complication.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.274
It's about your girl.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.243
Kara? We had a deal.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.412
You told me you could get her
here on one of the next pilgrimages.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.514
Like I said, there's been
a complication.

03:00.548 --> 03:03.351
Now if you want me
to get her here,

03:03.384 --> 03:05.185
you're going to have
to do something.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.787
I'm listening.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.792
You might want a shot
of courage first.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.963
Hey.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.331
Hi.
Good morning.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.032
What brings you to my end
of the compound?

03:19.066 --> 03:20.234
Oh, well, Jim
asked me

03:20.268 --> 03:21.411
to autopsy this soldier
that was killed.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.504
See if anything out
of the ordinary turned up.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.574
I won't distract you.
Okay.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.281
Amazing.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.449
Just amazing.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.254
Ankylosaurus.

03:40.288 --> 03:41.755
Where'd you get it?

03:41.789 --> 03:44.825
In a nest near
the scene of the accident.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.963
Oh, wow, looks
pretty damaged.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.332
The others had hatched.

03:51.365 --> 03:53.367
This one, unfortunately,
didn't make it.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.970
But it is an incredible
research opportunity.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.739
I'd say so.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.774
Hey, babe.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.009
Hey.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.311
Hey, Zoe.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.413
Why aren't
you at school?

04:05.446 --> 04:07.415
Well, her teacher
sent for me.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.417
Somebody has
an earache.

04:09.450 --> 04:12.386
Oh. And yesterday it was
your tummy, wasn't it?

04:12.420 --> 04:14.254
I just miss you, Mommy.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.524
I know you do, sweetheart,

04:16.557 --> 04:17.634
but school is
really important.

04:17.658 --> 04:21.261
Look, I need to just have
a quick word with Daddy.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.331
So why don't you go
and take a look

04:23.364 --> 04:24.674
at some of that cool
stuff over there.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.310
Just be careful not to
touch anything, all right?

04:26.334 --> 04:28.001
Go on.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.473
The autopsy turn up anything?

04:32.506 --> 04:35.543
Yeah, I was just in the middle of
something when you came in. Great.

04:37.077 --> 04:40.213
So I found two types of blood
on Foster's torso.

04:40.247 --> 04:41.715
One was his.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.217
And the second's
probably from the Nyko.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.553
Yes, that's what
I was thinking.

04:45.586 --> 04:50.391
Hmm, it says the second type of
blood came from one of those.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.259
I don't understand.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.294
I think I do.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.163
Malcolm.

04:56.196 --> 04:58.399
What's a Nykoraptor's
favorite food?

04:58.432 --> 05:01.335
You're looking at it.

05:01.369 --> 05:04.738
It's a Galesaur.
Sort of a prehistoric turkey.

05:04.772 --> 05:05.973
Why?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.975
I think this was a murder.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.743
Help me out here.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.712
How do you kill a man
with a dinosaur?

05:11.745 --> 05:15.483
You trap it somewhere where you
know the victim's going to show up.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.586
All you need is the right bait and
knowledge of your vic's schedule.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.354
We found blood from
the bait that was used

05:20.388 --> 05:22.022
to lure the Nyko
inside the shed.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.557
And the back
of that door

05:23.591 --> 05:26.460
was covered in scratches from
when it was trying to get out.

05:26.494 --> 05:32.032
We've lost our share of folks,
but never like this.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.767
Not to murder.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.540
Foster was a good soldier.

05:39.573 --> 05:43.243
If somebody killed him,
I want to know who.

05:43.276 --> 05:46.213
Find out. Do it quick
and do it quiet.

05:46.246 --> 05:48.416
Wash, you're on this with him.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.685
First thing, we should
talk to his friends.

05:52.853 --> 05:57.425
A day like today, I think
I know where they'll be.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.204
Boys.
Lieutenant.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.105
Hi, Mr. Shannon.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.173
Hey.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.808
Sorry about Foster.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.343
And I'm sorry to
interrupt you guys.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.945
I know this isn't
a good time,

06:17.978 --> 06:20.948
but I've got a few questions I
need to ask if that's okay? Sure.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.183
Did Foster get along with
everyone in your unit?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.753
Uh, pretty much. Why?

06:25.786 --> 06:28.856
Can you think of anyone who
would have wanted to harm him?

06:28.889 --> 06:32.192
Hold on, you're investigating
this as a murder or something?

06:32.225 --> 06:34.294
I don't
believe this.

06:34.327 --> 06:37.264
You know, Foster was
seeing a woman.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.166
Yeah? What's her name?
I don't know.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.368
None of us do.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.036
He never told us
who she is.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.006
Yeah, but he was always
up in his bunk

06:46.039 --> 06:48.108
looking at pictures
of her on his tag.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.244
I thought they only held
personal info and blood type.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.080
Yeah, plus a medical history

06:53.113 --> 06:55.949
and a locator. You're not
supposed to, but everyone hacks in

06:55.983 --> 06:58.519
and throws a couple of pictures
of loved ones on there.

06:58.552 --> 06:59.853
Maybe some music
for when

06:59.887 --> 07:02.189
you're holed up someplace
or on a long patrol.

07:02.222 --> 07:04.257
Well, thanks, gentlemen,

07:04.291 --> 07:07.427
and again, sorry for your loss.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.498
You find it odd that
this mystery woman

07:10.531 --> 07:13.333
hasn't stepped forward? Now
you're getting the hang of this.

07:13.366 --> 07:15.969
So let's go take a look
at Foster's tag.

07:16.003 --> 07:19.172
Foster's personal effects...
Can we, uh, can we see them?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.908
Well, yeah.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.181
Could you get me the deceased's
personal effects, please.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.277
Thanks.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.146
What's going on?

07:26.179 --> 07:28.916
Well, Foster had
a dog tag...

07:32.620 --> 07:35.523
Be careful! Be, be
very careful with that.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.024
Gently, sweetheart.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.125
Sorry.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.093
It's broken.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.530
Are you trying
to fix it?

07:46.233 --> 07:48.468
The baby wants
to come out.

07:48.502 --> 07:52.239
- My God, it's still alive!
- Who would have thought?!

07:52.272 --> 07:54.942
You're going to help it,
right?

07:59.179 --> 08:02.583
Yeah, of course we are,
sweetheart, yeah.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.585
Hey.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.756
Okay.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.291
A few terras.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.960
A flashlight.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.828
But the tag wasn't recovered.

08:14.862 --> 08:18.131
You said it has a locator.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.202
It's on the move.
Yeah.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.005
A Nyko must
have eaten it.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.175
Then we're going to have
to go get that Nyko.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.251
Shannon, you copy?

08:39.285 --> 08:40.788
Copy.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.389
You two have eyes
on the Nyko?

08:42.422 --> 08:44.892
Negative, sir. We lost it.
Stand by.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.065
Contact! Eyes on target, 9:00!

08:52.099 --> 08:54.367
20 meters!

08:54.401 --> 08:56.169
Good. Flank him to the right.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.337
Swing him back towards me.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.872
Coming your way.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.275
All right, up ahead
is the choke point.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.452
It dead-ends in dense forest.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.145
Force it
into the shooting gallery.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.155
We got you now.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.135
Anybody got a visual?

09:28.168 --> 09:29.837
No joy, sir.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.773
All right, just so we're clear...

09:32.806 --> 09:35.575
We're not killing
this thing, right?

09:35.609 --> 09:37.477
No need. Whatever
we get out of its belly,

09:37.510 --> 09:39.046
we're going to obtain on site.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.683
Lieutenant Washington there is
about the finest combat medic

09:42.716 --> 09:46.353
I've ever had the pleasure to be stitched
up by, isn't that right, Lieutenant?

09:46.386 --> 09:47.788
If you say so, sir.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.790
How many stitches you put
in my side that time?

09:49.823 --> 09:51.124
67, sir.
Yeah.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.572
Where'd it go?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.175
How long can
he stay up there?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.844
You got somewhere you
need to be, Lieutenant?

10:10.878 --> 10:15.082
I'd love not to be here
when the sun sets.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.294
How long can
he stay up there?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.869
We got him.
Open him up.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.382
This was the bait.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.221
And, uh, this is
what else he ate

10:54.254 --> 10:56.056
when he was in the shed.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.425
And here's what we came for.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.427
Foster's tag.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.730
It's pretty banged up.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.399
There he is,

11:06.433 --> 11:08.635
and he's with a woman,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.303
but I don't think
I know her.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.405
We can run a facial rec

11:12.439 --> 11:13.440
against our database.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.508
Damn it to hell.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.510
It's okay, sir.
I recognize her.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.712
She works at the Mess Hall.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.213
Yeah, I know Foster.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.150
I know you, too.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.119
Working in the Mess,
I meet my share of soldiers.

11:27.187 --> 11:31.792
Well, his friends seem to think
it was, um... more than that.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.593
I was nice to him.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.629
Support staff,
it's our job to be nice.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.698
I'm sorry if he took
it the wrong way.

11:38.732 --> 11:42.169
Look at this.

11:44.905 --> 11:48.075
Terra Nova
lottery notification.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.610
How long you guys
been married?

11:50.643 --> 11:52.379
Three years.

11:52.412 --> 11:57.918
And was the wedding before
or after he... got this?

11:58.351 --> 12:00.353
Hmm. So what happened?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.090
You loved him until he got you
through the Portal,

12:03.123 --> 12:04.825
then you traded up
for another man?

12:04.858 --> 12:05.869
I mean, I'm just
spitballing here.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.394
I'm a married woman.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.596
You can't just come in here
and make accusations.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.899
Honey?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.635
Afternoon,
Mr. Milner.

12:15.668 --> 12:16.937
I'm Jim Shannon
from Security.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.972
This is Lieutenant Washington.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.209
Why are you here?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.477
It's about the soldier
who died, Ken Foster.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.046
It's nothing, Howard.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.290
They're just asking
some questions.

12:27.314 --> 12:27.981
Yeah.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.850
Are you okay, Mr. Milner?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.151
You-you seem upset.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.285
I'm fine.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.363
'Cause your wife knew this man
Foster from the Mess Hall.

12:34.387 --> 12:37.024
Of course I do I serve
these guys every day.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.126
Look, I told them this already.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.495
I don't know what the hell
they're still doing here. Shut up.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.865
Just shut up.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.801
Do you think I didn't know?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.369
Do you think I'm a fool?

12:50.871 --> 12:52.873
Well, you're here, right?

12:52.906 --> 12:56.043
You're gonna find out
sooner or later.

12:57.244 --> 13:01.248
I killed
that son of a bitch Foster.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.252
And given the chance,
I'd kill him again.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.788
Hey.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.991
I just dropped Zoe
back at school.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.993
All she could talk
about was this egg.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.395
Please give me
some good news.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.064
Well, I wish I could.

13:17.097 --> 13:19.766
It looks like the reason it
didn't hatch with the others

13:19.799 --> 13:21.101
is that it has birth defects.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.070
You see this dark patch here?
Yeah.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.039
Its front right leg
is fused to its neck,

13:26.073 --> 13:28.675
which has compromised its
windpipe and its blood flow.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.243
And if it were
to hatch now,

13:30.277 --> 13:32.045
it wouldn't get nearly
enough oxygen.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.256
Wouldn't survive
three minutes.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.082
The mother must've
had to abandon it

13:35.115 --> 13:37.050
to care for the other
hatchlings. Yes.

13:37.084 --> 13:39.719
And I'm afraid we have
to abandon it, too.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.955
Oh, no, that's not
gonna work for me.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.457
You saw the look on her face.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.895
No, there must be something
we can do to help it along.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.429
I don't know yet.

13:49.462 --> 13:52.665
Um... in ovo surgery through
the shell if we have to.

13:54.767 --> 13:58.038
There's gotta
be something.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.710
When did you find out that
your wife was having an affair?

14:03.743 --> 14:06.046
I just did
who cares how?

14:11.418 --> 14:14.221
I do.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.891
The shed...
How'd you get it open?

14:17.925 --> 14:21.661
Anything with a circuit board
can be hacked.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.805
But how'd you know his shifts?

14:22.829 --> 14:24.831
That he'd be the one
to get the call?

14:24.864 --> 14:29.402
Well, I tailed him for a week.

14:29.436 --> 14:32.973
That night I went out and broke
the piece of equipment

14:33.006 --> 14:35.275
that caused the repair beacon
to sound.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.410
I tied up some bait
inside the shed.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.080
Then I waited in the rover
until the Nykoraptor came.

14:40.113 --> 14:44.117
When it went after the bait,
I closed the door behind it,

14:44.151 --> 14:45.953
and then I drove away.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.290
Very elaborate.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.994
I mean, you must, you must
really love this woman.

14:56.063 --> 14:59.032
With all my heart.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.068
You can't imagine
what it was like

15:01.101 --> 15:02.535
winning the lottery.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.005
Maybe you both had love

15:05.038 --> 15:07.840
in your lives,
maybe not.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.409
But I haven't.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.345
And then all of a sudden
there was a flood of it.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.482
And the best thing to come along
was Rebecca.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.384
And it was perfect.

15:18.418 --> 15:22.589
You know, coming back
to a world like this...

15:22.622 --> 15:25.959
how could she not love me
for bringing her here?

15:28.395 --> 15:31.231
How could I have been so stupid?

15:31.264 --> 15:34.401
Why didn't I see
that she was using me?

15:36.036 --> 15:39.439
But you know what
the stupidest thing of all was?

15:39.472 --> 15:43.710
Thinking that it could actually
be different for me this time.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.554
You were right.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.089
It was murder.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.491
Lieutenant Washington knows

15:58.525 --> 16:02.962
I expect my people to adhere
to a strict code of honor.

16:02.996 --> 16:07.100
For one of them
to get involved

16:07.134 --> 16:09.236
with a married
Terra Novan, well...

16:09.269 --> 16:11.938
that's not just frowned upon,

16:11.971 --> 16:14.041
I won't tolerate it.

16:14.074 --> 16:18.445
But Foster didn't
deserve to die for it.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.515
Shannon, have you been
out to Memorial Field?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.985
Not yet.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.987
It's beyond the fields

16:28.021 --> 16:29.456
before those low hills.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.192
Simple headstones buried
in the earth.

16:32.225 --> 16:37.397
We have sustained losses...
Fallen soldiers,

16:37.430 --> 16:38.965
accidents,

16:38.998 --> 16:44.237
citizens who succumbed
to syncillic fever.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.243
But we've never had a
murder in Terra Nova.

16:55.382 --> 16:59.219
Unless I commute Milner's
sentence to imprisonment,

16:59.252 --> 17:01.921
the bylaw says banishment.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.590
Out there?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.392
Out there.

17:05.425 --> 17:09.628
I'm going to go
bury our soldier.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.134
And I'm going to
make a decision.

17:14.166 --> 17:18.405
I don't recall ever having
to make a tougher one.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.878
So Boylan said
if I want to get Kara here,

17:26.913 --> 17:29.249
I have to meet with someone.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.452
It's outside the gates.

17:32.485 --> 17:36.123
Why can't you just
meet at the bar?

17:37.924 --> 17:40.026
It's Mira.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.863
Leader of the
Sixers, Mira?

17:43.896 --> 17:47.033
Is there another one? 'Cause if
there is, it'd be pretty awesome

17:47.066 --> 17:50.137
if I just misunderstood this
whole thing.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.574
You can't go.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.809
There's no telling
what she might be up to.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.511
I don't have a choice.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.979
Yes, you do.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.149
Look, I know you
promised Kara,

18:02.182 --> 18:03.983
but it's not worth
getting yourself killed.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.319
You have no idea
what 2149 is like.

18:07.887 --> 18:11.358
I had three friends junior year
that killed themselves.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.963
Nobody believes
they have a future.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.065
Nobody believes
in anything anymore.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.433
Nothing means anything.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.871
I have to get her out of there.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.342
Okay.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.380
But you're not going alone.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.660
It was quite moving today.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.762
Sad.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.565
The procession.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.200
Everyone in
the streets.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.101
Can you imagine that
back in Chicago?

19:29.135 --> 19:31.471
No. Honestly, it felt
like something

19:31.504 --> 19:33.773
from another time
we've only ever read about.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.708
So what do you think
will happen tomorrow?

19:35.742 --> 19:37.710
I don't know, but
the good news is,

19:37.744 --> 19:40.213
there's not gonna
be a drawn-out trial.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.648
You don't think
he deserves one?

19:41.681 --> 19:44.617
He confessed. There's something
to be said for swift justice.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.019
But, Jim, come on,
this is wrong.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.622
It's frontier justice
you know that.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.424
You say that like
it's a bad thing,

19:51.458 --> 19:53.726
like I should miss the
system we left behind.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.928
You remember the crap
I dealt with.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.764
Everything moved
iceberg slow,

19:57.797 --> 19:59.432
and I'd work a good
case for months

19:59.466 --> 20:02.302
only to have someone buy
the verdict out from under me.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.404
Yeah, I know,
I know that was bad,

20:04.437 --> 20:06.906
but I fail to see how it's worse
than barbaric decisions

20:06.939 --> 20:08.016
being made by one man alone.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.709
Barbaric?
Yeah.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.444
Okay.

20:11.478 --> 20:14.113
Don't forget Milner's
a confessed killer.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.691
What do you think
we should do with him?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.784
Confine him.
Put him on trial.

20:17.817 --> 20:20.052
And if he's guilty,
then put him in prison,

20:20.086 --> 20:21.754
but try to show some mercy.

20:21.788 --> 20:22.822
I was just in prison.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.625
And "mercy" is not the first
word that comes to mind

20:25.658 --> 20:27.093
when I think back on my time.

20:27.126 --> 20:30.162
Maybe we should talk about this later.
If someone had given me the choice

20:30.196 --> 20:32.475
between an eight-by-eight in
Golad and a chance in the wild

20:32.499 --> 20:33.942
with a gun in my hand, I know
which one I would've picked.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.102
Okay, I didn't think
before I spoke, all right?

20:36.135 --> 20:37.604
I didn't mean it that way.
Maybe...

20:37.637 --> 20:39.081
I'm trying to take this back!
What do you want from me, Liz?

20:39.105 --> 20:40.006
I mean, I got a confession.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.774
You're acting like I
beat it out of the guy.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.710
Jim...

20:45.312 --> 20:47.280
I'm sorry.

20:47.314 --> 20:50.016
Like no one's ever had reason to
falsely confess?

20:55.922 --> 20:58.891
Hey. I'm sorry about Foster.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.026
Thanks.

21:00.059 --> 21:01.761
So the guy that did this

21:01.794 --> 21:04.397
gets banished
like he deserves.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.965
Sorry, I, uh...

21:05.998 --> 21:07.567
I know it sounds harsh.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.704
No. Look, I know you want
justice for your friend,

21:11.738 --> 21:16.509
but whatever happens, it's a
really sad day for the colony.

21:16.543 --> 21:20.647
I mean, this place is supposed
to be a new beginning.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.483
And I guess
I shouldn't be surprised

21:23.516 --> 21:26.052
that some of the old
problems followed us here.

21:43.035 --> 21:48.775
Howard Milner, you've confessed
to the murder of Ken Foster.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.780
Do you have anything else
to say for yourself?

21:59.051 --> 22:01.788
Ours is a colony of laws.

22:02.822 --> 22:07.960
A violation such as murder is a
crime against every one of us.

22:07.994 --> 22:12.064
Terra Nova cannot
survive unless we hold

22:12.098 --> 22:14.166
ourselves... hold each other...

22:14.200 --> 22:18.304
To standards higher than
our standards of the past.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.673
With a heavy heart...

22:21.808 --> 22:25.445
...I carry out this
judgment of banishment.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.249
Taylor!

22:30.282 --> 22:32.318
You know this is
a death sentence.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.887
Isn't there another way?

22:34.921 --> 22:39.091
The only way is forward,
for the good of the colony.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.961
What we're building here...

22:41.994 --> 22:44.564
There's no place for
a crime like this.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.199
Just as we've come back
to remake this world,

22:47.233 --> 22:50.102
we have to let
this world remake us.

22:50.136 --> 22:53.072
If we can't dare to live lives

22:53.105 --> 22:55.775
that are worthy of this
remarkable place,

22:55.808 --> 22:58.177
well, we should have
just stayed in the future

22:58.210 --> 23:00.079
to perish with the planet.

23:00.112 --> 23:03.950
Milner, you have
a fighting chance out there.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.918
That's more than
you gave Ken Foster.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.321
Don't ever come back
to the colony.

23:09.355 --> 23:12.158
You've made your own fate.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.160
Now live or die with it.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.489
Hey! Hey, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.190
What are you doing here?
Take it easy.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.992
Just put the weapon down.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.296
So.

24:24.330 --> 24:27.767
How you doing
out here so far?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.870
I would be scared
out of my mind.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.639
I mean, between the wildlife
and the Sixers,

24:32.672 --> 24:34.907
there's a lot of ways
to die in this jungle.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.043
Well, I... I deserve what I get.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.477
I gotta admit,

24:38.511 --> 24:42.782
I was surprised when Taylor
went through with the sentence.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.059
Seemed like a lot
of people were.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.894
What about you? Were you...
Were you surprised?

24:45.918 --> 24:48.487
We have a law.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.256
He followed it, so...

24:50.289 --> 24:51.289
No.

24:53.693 --> 24:54.837
Not sure I believe you, Howard.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.229
I think you were surprised.

24:57.263 --> 24:59.766
I think you were betting on
Taylor commuting the sentence.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.367
I mean, it would have
been a lot easier

25:01.400 --> 25:03.002
to be the hero
in a colony jail

25:03.035 --> 25:04.036
than it is out here.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.172
The hero?
What are you talking about?

25:06.205 --> 25:08.641
Well, I saw the way you
and Rebecca were looking

25:08.675 --> 25:10.710
at each other back there,
and it got me thinking.

25:10.743 --> 25:12.278
I mean, what if she
killed Foster?

25:15.948 --> 25:18.651
I know you're crazy about her.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.787
The question is,

25:20.820 --> 25:23.422
are you crazy enough to
fall on your sword for her

25:23.455 --> 25:25.124
when it means facing
this jungle alone?

25:30.129 --> 25:31.230
What do you want?

25:34.634 --> 25:36.002
Howard!

25:36.035 --> 25:37.269
I'm sorry.

25:37.303 --> 25:39.238
I couldn't go through with it.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.440
Go through with what?

25:41.473 --> 25:44.043
I know Foster broke things off
with you a couple of weeks ago.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.351
So, isn't that why you did it?

25:52.384 --> 25:54.186
Did what?

25:54.220 --> 25:56.589
Hang on, what... you...

25:56.623 --> 25:57.757
You think I killed him?

25:57.790 --> 26:00.960
What...? So, you didn't?

26:00.993 --> 26:02.394
Of course not!

26:04.263 --> 26:05.732
Is that why you confessed?

26:05.765 --> 26:08.735
Well, I... I didn't want you
sent out there to die alone.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.675
So, Howard,
when you confessed to me,

26:15.708 --> 26:16.876
how did you know what to say?

26:16.909 --> 26:19.378
I'd heard the details
of the crime

26:19.411 --> 26:20.780
flying around the colony.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.058
Whoever killed Foster clearly
had a reason to spread them.

26:23.082 --> 26:26.819
But Rebecca...

26:26.853 --> 26:28.120
Foster did end it with you.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.991
To be honest,
I was happy that he did.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.693
I'm better off without him.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.762
Why is that?

26:35.795 --> 26:37.997
He turned out to be a jerk.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.700
He chose his friends,
and his drinking,

26:40.733 --> 26:41.634
and his gambling over me.

26:41.668 --> 26:42.935
Gambling?

26:42.969 --> 26:45.204
It was all he cared about.

26:45.237 --> 26:47.874
He was always over at
Boylan's playing cards.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.241
There's quite a scene
over there.

26:49.275 --> 26:53.579
But it's illegal, so people
stay pretty quiet about it.

26:55.381 --> 26:59.051
Just what exactly were
you thinking, Shannon?

26:59.085 --> 27:02.789
Look, you told me to do
my job, and I did.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.057
Milner recanted his confession.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.760
Well, how do you know he
didn't just take it back

27:07.794 --> 27:09.428
'cause he got scared
to death out there?

27:09.461 --> 27:10.797
My gut's telling me.

27:10.830 --> 27:14.366
Oh. Oh, well,
why didn't you say so?

27:14.400 --> 27:16.202
Commander, let me explain.

27:16.235 --> 27:17.704
No, you let me explain.

27:17.737 --> 27:19.071
Banishing Milner,

27:19.105 --> 27:22.341
I put a huge chunk of my
reputation on the line.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.912
You saw as well as I did,
not everybody was overjoyed

27:25.945 --> 27:28.614
with my decision to stick to
the letter of the law on this,

27:28.647 --> 27:31.583
and now you tell me that
I got the wrong guy?

27:31.617 --> 27:33.319
But he's alive.
And I got a new lead.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.521
So if we keep the Milner
return under wraps

27:35.554 --> 27:37.456
just long enough for
me to follow it...

27:37.489 --> 27:39.325
You do exactly that.

27:39.358 --> 27:43.863
'Cause your gut's not
good enough on this.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.133
You follow that new lead.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.669
Otherwise, I guarantee you
I am bouncing Milner's ass

27:50.703 --> 27:52.739
right back outside that gate.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.282
Rotate ten degrees.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.250
Stop.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.753
There we go.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.188
Almost there.

28:09.221 --> 28:10.289
Amazing.

28:10.322 --> 28:13.392
Shame Jim couldn't be here
to see you work your magic.

28:13.425 --> 28:17.296
Well, surgery's not really
a spectator sport.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.133
Well, with you
holding the knife,

28:21.167 --> 28:22.568
it should be.

28:22.601 --> 28:24.570
You're very sweet, but...

28:24.603 --> 28:29.008
I'm sure Jim has many more
important things to do today

28:29.041 --> 28:32.711
than watch me attempt
to alter nature's course.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.515
Okay.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.384
Uh... Foster's financials.

28:38.417 --> 28:41.353
I've got them right here.

28:43.756 --> 28:46.692
Looks like Rebecca was right
about what goes on at Boylan's.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.294
That is interesting.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.396
Look who owed Foster
a lot of money.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.497
Okay.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.099
Let's take it to Taylor.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.843
He's going to want a real
confession this time.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.969
Yeah. And I know
how to get it.

29:01.273 --> 29:02.641
Mr. Sheriff!

29:02.674 --> 29:04.043
Welcome back.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.478
And Commander Taylor.
Now, what a pleasure.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.580
You never darken my door.

29:08.614 --> 29:10.282
Josh?

29:10.316 --> 29:11.450
Hi, Dad.

29:11.483 --> 29:12.518
What are you doing here?

29:12.551 --> 29:14.486
I work here.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.555
We're very impressed
with your boy.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.057
Josh has already proven himself

29:18.090 --> 29:20.026
a very worthy
member of the team.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.828
We'll talk about that,
you bet your ass,

29:21.861 --> 29:23.329
but first things first.

29:23.362 --> 29:29.301
Boylan, I been looking forward
to saying this for a long time.

29:29.335 --> 29:31.703
We're taking you in.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.840
What are you doing?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.308
You nuts?

29:36.342 --> 29:39.578
You have never made a bigger
mistake in your life, Taylor.

29:39.611 --> 29:43.049
Okay, get up.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.952
Easy!

30:01.367 --> 30:03.569
The long and the short of
it is this, Boylan:

30:03.602 --> 30:05.938
You're going to come clean
about gambling at your place,

30:05.972 --> 30:07.673
or I might have
to shut you down.

30:07.706 --> 30:10.076
Oh, Commander.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.412
Your loyal subjects
would just love that.

30:13.445 --> 30:17.749
I created the one place in
Terra Nova that operates

30:17.783 --> 30:20.319
just outside your grip.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.254
Close my shop,

30:22.288 --> 30:25.524
and see how people respond
when you take that away.

30:25.557 --> 30:26.926
You run card games.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.360
And we know you take a cut.

30:28.394 --> 30:32.698
Are there card games that
take place under my roof?

30:32.731 --> 30:33.866
Yeah.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.435
Do I take a small
percentage off the top?

30:36.468 --> 30:39.038
Well...
Define small.

30:39.071 --> 30:41.240
Now, is that unreasonable?

30:41.273 --> 30:42.508
No.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.043
No, it is not.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.578
Foster played at your shop,
didn't he?

30:46.612 --> 30:49.215
Yeah. So?

30:51.317 --> 30:53.819
Well, you don't
think I killed him.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.821
- Did you?
- No.

30:55.854 --> 30:56.855
Why would I?

30:56.889 --> 30:59.425
Same reason you do everything.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.526
Money.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.528
See, Boylan,

31:02.561 --> 31:05.497
colony financials told
us something good, but...

31:05.531 --> 31:08.800
well, we dug deeper and
found something even better.

31:08.834 --> 31:11.703
You keep off line
financial records.

31:11.737 --> 31:15.141
Old-school.
On, on paper.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.809
And they're going to tell us
everything we need to know

31:17.843 --> 31:19.345
about you and Ken Foster.

31:20.779 --> 31:21.981
Bar's closed.

31:22.014 --> 31:25.251
You, too. Get out.
Get some air.

31:26.752 --> 31:28.787
Josh, come here.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.856
I want you to check
behind the bar,

31:30.889 --> 31:32.091
in the back room, every inch.

31:32.124 --> 31:35.527
That ledger's here somewhere.
Find it.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.264
Today's your last day, buddy.
You're not working here.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.598
Yes, I am.

31:39.631 --> 31:40.599
No, no. There's no discussion.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.244
You're always on me about
taking responsibility,

31:42.268 --> 31:44.836
and then all of a sudden you
don't approve of the job I get?

31:44.870 --> 31:46.572
No, it's not just
that this is a bar.

31:46.605 --> 31:50.242
It's that you should have talked
to me and your mother first.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.944
Why?

31:51.978 --> 31:53.545
So you could just
shoot it down?

31:53.579 --> 31:55.948
Either I'm supposed to
be an adult here, or I'm not.

31:55.982 --> 31:57.984
You better get
your stories straight.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.857
Tore the place apart.
If he's got that ledger,

32:05.891 --> 32:07.793
it definitely isn't here.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.861
Boylan ran. And he had help.

32:09.895 --> 32:10.896
Let's go.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.532
Move it out!
Let's go!

32:16.868 --> 32:17.803
Wash, you copy?

32:17.836 --> 32:19.171
Copy.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.873
I want you and Reynolds
to check the security logs.

32:21.907 --> 32:23.709
I want to know who
helped that scum.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.644
You got anything on the scanner?

32:25.677 --> 32:27.646
Yeah, life up ahead.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.081
Hang on, sir.

32:29.115 --> 32:31.383
Signal stopped moving, sir.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.724
We're closing in on the signal.

32:38.757 --> 32:40.092
Right up ahead.

32:40.126 --> 32:42.328
Wash, what's the status
on that security cam?

32:43.895 --> 32:45.931
Nothing yet.
I'm still scanning.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.234
Copy that. Taylor out.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.905
This is supposed to be the spot.

32:53.939 --> 32:56.875
Signal's coming
from right here.

32:56.908 --> 32:58.344
Boylan!

32:58.377 --> 33:02.214
Well, maybe
the scanner's busted.

33:06.052 --> 33:09.221
If I were a betting man,
I'd say he's not here.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.560
You a betting man, Jim?

33:14.593 --> 33:15.761
No, I am not.

33:15.794 --> 33:17.896
But, Curran...

33:17.929 --> 33:19.965
you are.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.233
What are you
talking about?

33:21.267 --> 33:23.635
The money you owe Foster.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.375
Your account's been tapped.

33:29.408 --> 33:33.045
Last four transactions
all payments made to Foster.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.247
How much more
did you owe him, son?

33:35.281 --> 33:37.716
How much couldn't you pay him?

33:37.749 --> 33:41.287
You're way off, sir.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.096
Now, you look me in the eye

33:50.129 --> 33:53.932
and you tell me
you didn't kill Foster.

33:53.965 --> 33:55.634
I didn't.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.369
I didn't kill him.

33:58.504 --> 33:59.805
You're lying.

33:59.838 --> 34:01.840
Prove it.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.843
I don't have to.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.478
I know you did it.

34:06.512 --> 34:09.114
I can tell.

34:13.952 --> 34:16.388
The Boylan arrest was staged?

34:16.422 --> 34:17.856
Yeah.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.458
So, why'd you bring me out here?

34:20.492 --> 34:23.529
Couldn't we have just
done this inside the gates?

34:25.496 --> 34:28.134
No.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.849
You didn't think
I'd give you a live one?

34:43.882 --> 34:47.186
It's over.

35:01.066 --> 35:03.202
One of my soldiers
kills one of our own?

35:03.235 --> 35:05.771
I should separate your head
from your shoulders!

35:09.775 --> 35:11.076
You didn't kill Foster?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.745
You didn't
kill Foster?

35:13.779 --> 35:15.481
No!

35:24.055 --> 35:26.192
Then why'd you
steal this

35:26.225 --> 35:28.227
from the bar, huh?

35:28.260 --> 35:32.198
Except to hide the fact
that you owed Foster money.

35:35.967 --> 35:38.337
You're staying here.

35:40.005 --> 35:41.106
You can't do this.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.941
I can, and I am.

35:42.974 --> 35:43.975
No!

35:44.009 --> 35:46.345
Are you out of your mind?!

35:48.079 --> 35:50.582
You can't prove
I did anything.

35:50.616 --> 35:54.353
We-We're going back, and
I get a court-martial.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.589
You just had one.

35:59.090 --> 36:01.693
Start walking.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.962
With nothing?

36:03.995 --> 36:05.997
No.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.334
Sir, come on.

36:10.068 --> 36:12.204
Well, you gave
Milner a gun.

36:12.238 --> 36:15.674
You can't send me out
there with nothing!

36:19.578 --> 36:21.913
Okay.

36:21.947 --> 36:23.849
I'm going.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.286
I'm going.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.594
You think he'll survive
out there on his own?

36:35.627 --> 36:36.895
I did.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.898
It can be done.

36:39.931 --> 36:41.099
Whatever happens,

36:41.132 --> 36:43.835
I'm not gonna lose
any sleep over it.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.427
Hell of a thing.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.863
Him taking a fall
like that for her.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.832
And him taking her back.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.967
If that ain't love.

37:19.405 --> 37:22.474
Hey, Boylan, thanks
for playing along today.

37:22.508 --> 37:25.677
You know, that's the
first and last time

37:25.711 --> 37:28.013
I do a favor for
you for free.

37:28.046 --> 37:30.449
And here I was starting to think

37:30.482 --> 37:33.018
you might actually
be good for something.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.358
That man does not like you.

37:39.391 --> 37:43.061
You could die trying
to please everybody.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.935
Sounds good.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.604
Where is everybody?

37:52.638 --> 37:55.173
Uh, Zoe wanted to go
and watch the egg hatch,

37:55.206 --> 37:57.042
so Mom took her over there.

37:57.075 --> 38:00.178
Maddy called it
an early night.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.581
Okay, and what are
you still doing here?

38:02.614 --> 38:03.982
Aren't you
late for work?

38:06.818 --> 38:07.853
You serious?

38:07.886 --> 38:10.789
Look, uh, I would have
liked for you

38:10.822 --> 38:12.724
to have talked to us
before taking this job,

38:12.758 --> 38:13.768
but guess you're
old enough now

38:13.792 --> 38:16.061
to start making
your own decisions.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.633
Stay out of trouble
over there.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.035
And, Josh, in
this family,

38:24.069 --> 38:26.304
no secrets.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.619
My dad changed his mind.

38:40.652 --> 38:44.356
As long as you can pay
me, the deal's back on.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.492
What the hell's she doing here?

38:46.525 --> 38:48.403
She's not gonna tell anyone
she just wants to help.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.661
Oh, great.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.163
Well, there's a stack
of dirty dishes back at the bar.

38:52.197 --> 38:53.799
Look, how much
do you trust Mira?

38:53.832 --> 38:54.700
I don't.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.134
But I've been told
I have issues.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.970
Okay, well, you send him OTG
in the middle of the night

38:59.004 --> 39:00.038
and he doesn't come back,

39:00.071 --> 39:01.106
that's bad
for everyone.

39:01.139 --> 39:02.173
You know he stands

39:02.207 --> 39:04.042
a better chance with me.

39:08.814 --> 39:11.783
Okay, you're meeting just
outside the perimeter mines,

39:11.817 --> 39:13.919
so you should be
safe from predators.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.020
But just in case,

39:15.053 --> 39:17.989
take this.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.893
Follow this map exactly,

39:21.927 --> 39:24.763
and you'll get to
the rendezvous point.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.065
Then what?

39:30.669 --> 39:33.805
Then you pray Mira likes
surprises better than I do.

39:46.785 --> 39:49.154
Should be
just up ahead.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.060
Okay.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.095
Hey, whoa.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.797
I'm not going in there blind.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.099
This way.

40:07.005 --> 40:08.740
Where are they?

40:10.676 --> 40:13.144
Behind those rocks.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.734
I didn't ask for her.

40:35.767 --> 40:36.902
You're right, you should

40:36.935 --> 40:38.069
probably just
turn her loose.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.671
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Enough!

40:39.705 --> 40:42.073
You're the cop's kid.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.909
Or Josh.

40:45.711 --> 40:48.514
But "the cop's
kid" works.

40:50.415 --> 40:53.218
For Boylan to
work his magic,

40:53.251 --> 40:54.986
get your girl here,

40:55.020 --> 40:58.023
he's got to be able
to talk to 2149.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.892
Which means he's got
to go through me.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.203
You want money, too, is that it?

41:02.227 --> 41:04.262
Not money.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.965
But someday I'm gonna ask
you to do something for me.

41:06.998 --> 41:11.069
And when that day comes,
you'll comply without question.

41:11.102 --> 41:13.004
Without hesitation.

41:13.038 --> 41:15.641
Do we have a deal?

41:23.048 --> 41:24.916
Yes. Yes.

41:24.950 --> 41:26.985
Take them back to
where you found them

41:27.018 --> 41:29.487
and point them home.

41:38.096 --> 41:40.231
Hey.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.305
Anything yet?

41:47.338 --> 41:49.340
No, still waiting.

41:49.374 --> 41:52.077
Where's Malcolmus?

41:52.110 --> 41:54.212
He went home.

42:15.433 --> 42:17.769
You did it, Mommy.

42:20.171 --> 42:22.908
Very gently, very gently.

42:27.278 --> 42:30.248
Can we keep him?

42:31.683 --> 42:34.820
Can we? Just for
a little while?
