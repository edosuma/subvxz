WEBVTT

03:11.826 --> 03:13.795
Did you get everything you need?

03:15.963 --> 03:16.931
I saw you shooting me,

03:16.964 --> 03:22.804
Stalker.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.807
OK. OK, yeah you caught me.

03:26.741 --> 03:28.810
So I'm...

03:28.843 --> 03:29.944
Tessa. From Echo Park.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.313
Look, I assumed shooting
you was OK since you were late

03:33.346 --> 03:35.650
and I, I was just bored.

03:43.858 --> 03:47.461
Aren't you supposed to offer me
a drink or something?

03:48.529 --> 03:50.497
Right. Hey, yo, Stace.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.298
What do you want?

03:51.331 --> 03:53.266
Uh, Red-eye large.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.502
What's up, Nicky?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.939
Can we get two large
Red-eyes...in uh...

03:59.040 --> 04:00.908
Sure thing. Yeah. In to-go cups.

04:00.942 --> 04:04.946
So does photographing
unsuspecting girls constitute
art for you?

04:06.514 --> 04:07.815
It's a little creepy.

04:08.082 --> 04:08.916
Creepy?

04:08.950 --> 04:10.585
Yeah. Creepy.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.420
Let me show you something.

04:14.155 --> 04:16.289
Can I invade your space for a
sec?

04:16.323 --> 04:19.259
Invade away.

04:20.962 --> 04:22.630
Do me a favor.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.032
Hold this knob and turn it

04:25.066 --> 04:28.435
so it gets really close to your
eyes.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.538
Alright, you see that? Yeah.
You got my scar.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.006
You got a scar. Where?

04:36.611 --> 04:37.678
Me too.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.987
But, uh, that's not what I'm
talking about.

04:46.821 --> 04:47.789
Look again.

04:48.256 --> 04:50.390
What am I looking at?

04:50.423 --> 04:52.593
How crystal clear the focus is.

04:52.627 --> 04:53.861
Yes, it's very crystal.

04:53.895 --> 04:57.031
Yeah, see...

04:57.565 --> 05:00.935
A regular person
wouldn't just hold that pose for
so long.

05:01.836 --> 05:03.838
Kind of feels...

05:04.172 --> 05:05.706
unnatural.

05:06.174 --> 05:08.910
Usually when I shoot candid
shots,
the subject would be moving

05:09.610 --> 05:10.845
One inch this way, one inch the
other.

05:10.878 --> 05:13.480
You lose the focus.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.316
I lose the shot. OK.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.753
You know what this feels like?

05:18.786 --> 05:21.388
No. Educate me.

05:21.421 --> 05:23.891
It almost feels like you stood
still because you knew I was
there.

05:24.525 --> 05:28.896
Like...maybe you liked it.

05:32.567 --> 05:33.668
Here y'all.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.937
Two large Red-eyes to go.

05:35.970 --> 05:37.705
Oh, thank you so much.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.607
Keep the change, alright?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.978
You want to go for a smoke and a
walk?

05:44.011 --> 05:46.080
I'm good with sitting.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.114
What?

05:47.148 --> 05:48.649
You don't like walking?

05:48.683 --> 05:49.650
Not really.

05:51.484 --> 05:52.954
Makes me feel closer to home.

05:52.987 --> 05:55.690
Are you trying to take me on an
adventure?

05:55.723 --> 05:56.456
Yeah.

05:57.959 --> 05:58.593
Yeah

05:58.626 --> 05:59.927
You ever hear of those, uh,

06:00.261 --> 06:01.461
7-Eleven adventures?

06:01.494 --> 06:02.530
No.

06:02.897 --> 06:04.165
It's pretty wild.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.567
All the cool kids are doing it.

06:06.601 --> 06:07.367
You in?

06:25.653 --> 06:28.522
Can I ask you a personal
question?

06:28.556 --> 06:29.090
Sure.

06:29.523 --> 06:31.792
So your pictures are very good.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.062
What the fuck are you doing
photographing

06:35.096 --> 06:38.498
shitty fucking SoundCloud
rappers?

06:38.532 --> 06:41.202
This way. They were respected
musicians from East Los Angeles

06:41.235 --> 06:42.703
thank you very much.

06:42.737 --> 06:44.505
And to answer your question...

06:44.538 --> 06:45.539
They paid me in pills.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.641
You like pills?

06:47.942 --> 06:49.777
I like the occasional trip to
Mars and back.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.212
That's interesting.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.180
Could be an adventure.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.518
Yeah, maybe.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.922
OK, this is me.

07:00.955 --> 07:02.723
OK.

07:05.927 --> 07:07.962
No, I live here.

07:08.296 --> 07:10.631
Yeah, no I gathered, weirdo.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.067
Do you need me to order you like
a ride or something?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.435
No. I'll keep doing the Chicago
thing.

07:21.742 --> 07:22.777
Hey, Nicky.

07:22.810 --> 07:23.476
Yeah?

07:23.511 --> 07:26.047
I did know you were watching.

07:26.080 --> 07:27.148
You were right.

07:29.050 --> 07:30.518
Right about what?

07:30.785 --> 07:31.852
I liked it.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.566
Hey, Ma.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.868
Yeah, no,
I'm on my way to a shoot right
now.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.904
I can't really talk, alright?

07:49.937 --> 07:52.139
Yeah no, the money's good. It's
a good shoot.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.042
I got to pull up. Tell...

07:55.076 --> 07:56.677
Yeah, tell Pop I said hi,
alright?

07:56.711 --> 07:58.212
OK.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.681
Hey, I love you ma. Bye.

08:44.892 --> 08:45.826
Fuck.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.294
It's too soft. Come on, Nicky.

08:47.328 --> 08:49.263
You piece of shit.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.035
That's not bad.

08:58.873 --> 08:59.740
Hey, fuckface.

08:59.774 --> 09:01.075
Hey, man.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.946
So, what's this big fucking
news?

09:06.280 --> 09:09.216
I got you a job,
and the pay is really great.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.218
Just me? You're not going to be
in it?

09:11.485 --> 09:12.686
No.

09:14.188 --> 09:15.122
OK, what is it?

09:15.156 --> 09:16.657
It's for Elixir magazine.

09:16.690 --> 09:18.059
Holy...it's crap...

09:18.092 --> 09:19.460
It's a shit magazine.

09:19.493 --> 09:23.097
All about high key lighting
women
in nothing next to nothing for

09:23.130 --> 09:24.698
no fucking reason.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.701
First off, that is not always
true.

09:28.069 --> 09:29.703
And second, what the fuck

09:29.737 --> 09:32.139
are you calling all these little
cash
shoots that you're doing for
spare change?

09:32.173 --> 09:33.607
It's not me saying anything.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.776
It's just point...and shoot some
shit.

09:35.810 --> 09:36.744
That's it.

09:36.777 --> 09:41.315
OK, well the spare change on
this one is 10K.

09:42.016 --> 09:43.884
Still not interested, but thank
you.

09:43.918 --> 09:46.353
Don't do that. Nicky!

09:46.387 --> 09:47.888
Nicky, seriously.

09:47.922 --> 09:51.058
Dude, you are way too fucking
talented
to not be moving this shit
forward.

09:51.092 --> 09:53.861
I didn't move out here to go
down someone else's path
and neither the fuck did you.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.898
See, this is why I'm glad we
met.

09:58.232 --> 09:59.133
We see eye to eye.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.769
Yeah yeah yeah. Go fuck
yourself.

10:01.802 --> 10:02.636
OK, I got to bail.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.737
I've got a shoot.

10:09.243 --> 10:09.977
What else we got?

10:10.010 --> 10:11.645
What else we got?

10:23.257 --> 10:24.191
Shit.

10:24.225 --> 10:25.126
Shit.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.033
Jesus Christ.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.001
Alright.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.240
Coming. Fuck.

10:51.185 --> 10:53.220
I come bearing gifts.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.359
Fuck.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.363
Alright, now this is creepy.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.368
Wait. How the fuck did you get
in here?

11:07.401 --> 11:10.971
Door's fucked. Did you take all
these?

11:11.005 --> 11:11.438
Yeah.

11:13.508 --> 11:17.044
Oh, Nicky from Chicago can take
a picture.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.247
OK, we have to get you out of
here

11:20.281 --> 11:23.284
and, as luck would have it,
I come with a plan.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.788
What exactly are we talking
about?

11:27.821 --> 11:31.458
The People Who Actually Fucking
Live Life
intro to L.A.

11:31.492 --> 11:33.127
The No Bullshit tour.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.095
No, I got a shit ton of work to
do.

11:35.129 --> 11:37.798
No, you don't. Yeah, I do.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.969
And also, I'm not into corny
fucking tours.

11:42.002 --> 11:44.738
Well, are you into corny fucking
tours

11:45.172 --> 11:46.373
on drugs?

11:52.780 --> 11:54.982
Maybe a little.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.016
Mm. That's what I thought.

12:05.459 --> 12:08.362
No fucking way. This might be
the cheesiest fucking thing.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.296
Yeah.

12:09.330 --> 12:11.732
Isn't that what first dates
consist of?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.169
Oh. So this is official, huh?

12:15.202 --> 12:17.905
Maybe, if you're lucky.

12:18.906 --> 12:23.410
OK, if this is the No Bullshit
tour, then I'm definitely gonna
need more Molly.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.947
Oh this? This is what you want?

12:27.348 --> 12:28.048
Yeah.

12:29.850 --> 12:30.518
Alright,

12:30.552 --> 12:32.219
surfing is definitely a thing.

12:32.253 --> 12:33.921
It's my thing.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.890
And it will soon be done by all
of the
tragically interesting people
everywhere.

12:37.992 --> 12:39.493
If you say so.

12:39.527 --> 12:43.797
I still say it's dangerous,
pushy as fuck,
and probably, probably illegal.

12:45.099 --> 12:47.101
You like those drugs, right?

12:47.134 --> 12:47.835
Yeah.

12:48.302 --> 12:50.337
It's a little hypocritical.

12:51.506 --> 12:52.473
Fine.

12:53.508 --> 12:54.942
Yes, Tessa.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.178
Yes, I like the drugs. Hmm. Hmm.

13:06.588 --> 13:08.022
OK, so let's recap.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.257
We got a little adventure.

13:10.291 --> 13:12.527
Yeah. A lot of comedy.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.161
Debatable.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.497
And we're about to have
an epically romantic kiss

13:16.531 --> 13:19.099
in the best view in all of Los
Angeles.

13:36.317 --> 13:38.352
That wasn't cheesy, was it?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.556
It was a little fucking cheesy.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.381
What are you thinking about?

14:07.414 --> 14:09.551
Champagne! No, fuck off. Why?

14:09.751 --> 14:12.386
You've been in
LA for fucking far too long.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.254
Champagne shots. Tequila? Yes.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.523
Whiskey? Yes. Champagne?

14:15.557 --> 14:17.024
No fucking way.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.059
OK, fine. We'll toss a coin.

14:19.426 --> 14:22.930
Heads, champagne. Tails,
whatever fucking shot

14:22.963 --> 14:25.499
you need to feel like a tough
guy,

14:25.533 --> 14:27.635
Tough Guy. OK, fine.

14:28.068 --> 14:31.405
But I'm tossing the coin
because I don't fucking trust
you.

14:31.740 --> 14:32.473
Ready? Fuck!

14:36.611 --> 14:39.012
Champagne,
please!

15:36.069 --> 15:37.037
Really?

15:44.344 --> 15:49.016
Oh! That is fucking disgusting.
Your face!

16:11.606 --> 16:15.976
Alright,
what do you want to do next?

16:16.778 --> 16:18.111
I want to dance.

16:18.145 --> 16:18.713
You can dance?

16:18.746 --> 16:19.714
Oh yes. I can dance.

16:19.747 --> 16:21.749
I might be the best dancer in
the whole world.

16:21.783 --> 16:24.184
I move like a fucking fish in
water.

16:24.218 --> 16:25.587
I fucking believe you. Can you
teach me?

16:25.620 --> 16:27.087
Yeah, of course. What's going on
in there?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.089
We're coming out to dance, man!

17:08.095 --> 17:09.463
You're so damn good.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.798
Sure.

17:10.832 --> 17:11.599
No, I mean it. I mean it.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.403
You need to be sharing this
point of view.

17:16.905 --> 17:20.708
No, seriously,
I've worked with so many
shooters.

17:20.742 --> 17:24.278
And none of them have, like,
a tenth of your talent.

17:26.179 --> 17:32.452
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Blah.

17:33.855 --> 17:34.822
Really? Hmm.

17:36.558 --> 17:38.125
That's my favorite photo.

17:38.158 --> 17:41.128
Look at those fucking eyes.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.063
OK, enough of that crap.

17:46.568 --> 17:48.703
I don't know what to think of
you.

17:48.736 --> 17:54.576
Good.

17:54.609 --> 17:57.579
Kind of...

17:58.880 --> 18:00.548
Kind of scare me a little bit.

18:00.582 --> 18:01.448
Good. Yeah.

18:01.616 --> 18:02.249
Good.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.553
Mm Hmm.

18:34.582 --> 18:37.585
Fucking jeans.
Fucking jeans.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.798
What are you doing? Don't move,
don't move, don't move.

21:04.132 --> 21:04.665
No, I look horrible.

21:04.699 --> 21:06.934
I have morning breath.

21:08.503 --> 21:10.905
First of all, you're gorgeous.

21:10.938 --> 21:13.775
And second of all, I promise
not to photograph your breath.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.512
You are so fucking beautiful.

21:28.589 --> 21:31.424
I'm gonna go get a coffee. You
want one?

21:31.458 --> 21:32.325
Yes, please.

21:32.994 --> 21:33.694
Alright.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.728
Hey, I forgot my wallet.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.366
Tessa.

22:20.174 --> 22:22.475
Why are you going through my
photos?

22:25.713 --> 22:26.346
Nick,

22:26.379 --> 22:27.882
I just thought I could help.

22:31.819 --> 22:33.554
Help?

22:33.588 --> 22:35.923
No, Tessa. What the fuck are you
doing?

22:37.725 --> 22:38.993
I was emailing

22:39.026 --> 22:41.996
my designer friend Rudy
some of your photo series.

22:42.429 --> 22:45.533
Who? Who the...

22:46.934 --> 22:48.169
Who the fuck is Rudy?

22:48.202 --> 22:51.939
Rudy is a friend,
and I think he'd really like
your vibe.

22:51.973 --> 22:54.407
And maybe he'd bring you in
to shoot his new line.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.442
No, no, no, no.

22:55.475 --> 22:58.646
Fuck that shit, Tessa. You
don't...

22:58.679 --> 23:01.716
You don't fucking go through my
shit
and send it to fucking anybody

23:01.749 --> 23:03.017
without asking me first.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.852
OK, you need to calm down
because you're yelling right
now.

23:04.886 --> 23:06.954
You see that, right? Yelling?

23:07.154 --> 23:07.822
How am I yelling?

23:07.855 --> 23:10.390
You're going through my shit!

23:43.190 --> 23:45.059
You're fucking welcome.

24:17.858 --> 24:20.094
Tessa, hey, um...

24:20.127 --> 24:22.930
I'm sorry, OK?

24:23.731 --> 24:24.165
I just

24:24.198 --> 24:24.832
I get...

24:25.900 --> 24:27.535
a little fucking crazy

24:27.568 --> 24:30.004
sometimes and I just

24:31.072 --> 24:32.873
I...I was an asshole.

24:37.812 --> 24:41.248
Could you, could you please
forgive me?

24:41.882 --> 24:43.951
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean
it. I didn't mean it.

24:58.833 --> 24:59.567
Come on. Come on.

25:03.270 --> 25:04.805
Come here.

25:41.342 --> 25:45.312
Tell me you're not obsessing
over those photos.
Shut it.

25:52.119 --> 25:53.888
Huh?

25:56.624 --> 25:59.794
What? What's up?

26:00.995 --> 26:02.930
Nothing.

26:15.676 --> 26:18.612
Alright. Where I'm from people
don't get

26:18.646 --> 26:19.280
what I'm doing.

26:19.313 --> 26:20.247
Actually,

26:21.082 --> 26:22.249
my mother

26:23.250 --> 26:26.053
she understood, right?

26:26.087 --> 26:27.588
But my father...

26:28.055 --> 26:29.223
when I told him about my phot-

26:29.256 --> 26:30.758
photography.

26:31.892 --> 26:34.128
The only thing he said to me was

26:35.930 --> 26:39.700
I hope you like the taste of
black beans.

26:39.733 --> 26:40.601
Meaning...

26:42.937 --> 26:43.604
he didn't really think

26:43.637 --> 26:45.673
I was going to amount to much.

26:46.841 --> 26:48.909
I guess I'm trying to say...

26:50.911 --> 26:52.746
Thanks for understanding.

26:54.415 --> 26:55.116
You know?

27:07.728 --> 27:08.929
OK, you're ready.

27:13.134 --> 27:14.802
Ready for what?

27:19.406 --> 27:21.308
Hey, how are you?

27:21.342 --> 27:23.711
Good to see you, this
is Nicky. Come on.

27:24.979 --> 27:25.412
What's up, man?

28:57.438 --> 28:58.138
Oh.

29:11.553 --> 29:13.354
Is that thing
still recording?

29:13.387 --> 29:16.357
Uh huh.

29:45.085 --> 29:48.856
Ooh. Mmm. That's gross.

30:03.237 --> 30:04.271
I want to

30:04.305 --> 30:05.873
Introduce you to Nemo. Where is
that little slut?

30:06.641 --> 30:08.842
Oh, there he is. Come, come on.

30:08.876 --> 30:10.578
Nemo!

30:11.646 --> 30:14.214
Sammy! Honey. Gorgeous.

30:14.248 --> 30:15.449
Mmmm.

30:15.482 --> 30:18.352
Look at you. You're beautiful.
This gold dress.
Thank you.

30:18.385 --> 30:21.021
Can I borrow it?
If you can fit your little tush
in it.

30:21.055 --> 30:23.891
You know I can.
How are you? I'm good.

30:23.924 --> 30:26.093
You know, just spicing things
up.
While more basic bitches flood
the catwalk.

30:26.126 --> 30:28.028
Oh my God, talking about basic
bitches,

30:28.062 --> 30:29.463
look at these basic bitches.

30:29.496 --> 30:30.397
Here, come with me.

30:30.431 --> 30:33.033
Did you know that everyone is a
cunt here?

30:33.067 --> 30:35.235
Cunt, Cunt, Cunt, C-

30:36.437 --> 30:39.873
Who's your handsome
cutie pie of a friend?

30:39.907 --> 30:41.008
And why haven't I seen you

30:41.041 --> 30:42.309
at one of my poisonous soirees.

30:42.343 --> 30:44.345
Wait, I know you. I do

30:46.980 --> 30:48.949
I had sex with you in a dream
once.

30:48.982 --> 30:51.619
Meow. What's your name again?
Uh, Nemo,

30:51.653 --> 30:56.490
this is the photographer slash
brilliant
artist that I told you about.
Oh?

30:57.191 --> 30:59.093
Nick Gatto, man. K. It's a
pleasure meeting you.

30:59.126 --> 31:00.327
Yeah.

31:01.261 --> 31:03.263
Yeah. I'm a big fan of your
lines, man.

31:03.297 --> 31:04.865
Ping, ping, ping. Ping.
Especially...

31:06.100 --> 31:07.067
Especially the sneakers.

31:07.101 --> 31:10.070
Boring. Is he party trained?

31:10.104 --> 31:11.372
I guess he is.

31:11.405 --> 31:13.006
How dare you,

31:13.040 --> 31:15.577
OK? How dare you come to this
party,

31:15.610 --> 31:18.646
take my friend, drinking my
champagne.

31:18.680 --> 31:19.913
Look at me.

31:19.947 --> 31:22.383
Yeah, I see you in those bedroom

31:22.416 --> 31:25.018
eyes, those cherry lips,
and you have the nerve

31:25.553 --> 31:28.489
to think that somehow
I'm going to give you a job?

31:29.557 --> 31:31.191
Is that what you think?

31:31.793 --> 31:34.161
Well, you're right, it's your
lucky day.

31:34.696 --> 31:36.631
I'm going to give you a job.

31:38.499 --> 31:40.134
I'm going to give you a blowjob.

31:43.571 --> 31:45.072
Why did you laugh?

31:45.105 --> 31:47.174
Sorry, it was too much. A
blowjob?

31:47.207 --> 31:49.476
I could have carried on.
You. Listen, man.

31:49.511 --> 31:50.545
We were fucking with you, man.

31:50.578 --> 31:51.679
You were fucking with me?

31:51.713 --> 31:53.947
Truly. I'm sorry, man. She was
alright.

31:53.981 --> 31:55.215
Hey, listen, I have seen your
work.

31:55.249 --> 31:58.285
Is it like, Chicago inspired or
L.A.?

31:58.318 --> 31:59.420
What's the deal?

31:59.721 --> 32:02.456
Yeah, I shot some of it
in Chicago and some of it here.

32:03.424 --> 32:05.092
And I moved to L.A.

32:05.125 --> 32:07.428
because I'm trying to fucking
figure out,
you know, where it's going. Hey
mate,

32:07.461 --> 32:09.531
We're all trying to figure out
what's going on.

32:09.731 --> 32:12.065
I believe in you. You're here,
right?

32:12.099 --> 32:12.933
Yeah. You're in town?

32:12.966 --> 32:14.736
Yeah. You're going to put us in
contact?

32:14.769 --> 32:16.538
Definitely.
Keep sending me your stuff, man.

32:16.571 --> 32:17.404
Keep doing it and

32:17.438 --> 32:19.239
maybe, you know, we'll do
something.

32:19.273 --> 32:20.073
Wait.

32:21.008 --> 32:21.643
What?

32:23.778 --> 32:24.378
Are you fucking with me?

32:24.411 --> 32:25.580
I'm not fucking with you.

32:25.613 --> 32:26.514
You're fucking with me? Im not
fucking with you anymore.

32:26.548 --> 32:29.049
Seriously,
I want to do something. Alright?

32:29.082 --> 32:29.617
I dig it, man.

32:29.651 --> 32:31.218
For real, OK?

32:31.251 --> 32:33.420
Yes? Yeah. I'm not fucking with
you.

32:33.454 --> 32:34.254
You're great.

32:34.288 --> 32:35.088
I love you.

32:35.122 --> 32:36.123
Good to see you.

32:36.156 --> 32:37.958
I'm going to go mingle with
these douchebags.

32:38.392 --> 32:40.595
I fucking love you.

32:41.663 --> 32:44.164
Thank you. You're welcome.

32:44.198 --> 32:47.201
Now, let's both go get laid,
shall we?

32:47.602 --> 32:48.435
Yes. Thank you.

33:32.312 --> 33:34.649
So what exactly is your plan for
me, sir?

33:37.150 --> 33:39.687
You know, I was thinking

33:39.721 --> 33:43.023
that this just isn't really
working out,
so we should probably just call
it quits.

33:43.892 --> 33:46.360
Yeah, I was thinking the same
thing.

33:46.393 --> 33:47.194
Good.

33:49.731 --> 33:52.667
Because I can't stand you.

35:36.971 --> 35:38.171
Tessa.

35:41.241 --> 35:42.376
Tessa, you,

35:42.409 --> 35:45.178
you gotta talk to me here.

35:48.816 --> 35:49.282
Come on.

35:49.316 --> 35:51.251
Please talk to me.

35:52.887 --> 35:54.254
Please. Who...

35:54.287 --> 35:56.524
Who were those guys?

36:04.866 --> 36:06.601
I'm gonna have to get out.

36:09.804 --> 36:10.470
What?

36:12.439 --> 36:14.676
I'm going to have to get out of
L.A.

36:19.346 --> 36:22.650
No. Mm mmm.

36:22.684 --> 36:24.384
Tessa, you can trust me.

36:24.418 --> 36:24.986
You know that, right?

36:25.019 --> 36:26.353
You can, you can...

36:26.386 --> 36:28.255
You can trust me.

36:28.890 --> 36:29.791
Come on.

36:29.824 --> 36:31.693
Just tell me what the fuck is
going on.

36:45.039 --> 36:47.809
When I first got to LA,

36:49.043 --> 36:52.814
I went to a party

36:54.481 --> 36:55.717
in the hills

36:59.419 --> 37:03.457
and it was the end of the night.

37:03.490 --> 37:06.426
I was about to call a ride.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.529
I...lost consciousness. And...

37:13.968 --> 37:15.368
My next

37:16.070 --> 37:18.740
memory is by a pool.

37:21.843 --> 37:24.311
I was completely naked on a pool
chair.

37:27.481 --> 37:29.550
And the youngest one, his name's
Matteo,

37:30.585 --> 37:31.886
he kissed me.

37:35.523 --> 37:38.258
It's really confusing because
the way

37:39.594 --> 37:41.428
that he was with me was, like,

37:41.461 --> 37:44.431
I was forgetting that

37:45.666 --> 37:48.536
like we were already together or
something.

37:49.402 --> 37:54.909
And... I remember us
having sex

37:58.445 --> 37:59.479
but it didn't...

38:00.347 --> 38:02.683
didn't feel like rape

38:02.717 --> 38:04.752
because he was being sweet.

38:05.720 --> 38:08.523
And, well, I was out of it.

38:08.556 --> 38:11.391
And I know that because

38:11.626 --> 38:15.029
my next memory is the tatted up

38:15.062 --> 38:17.031
one on top of me.

38:19.767 --> 38:21.569
He was so much bigger than me.

38:21.602 --> 38:23.738
He was rough and aggressive.

38:28.943 --> 38:31.344
And then the next one.

38:33.548 --> 38:35.917
It just went from,

38:36.449 --> 38:39.319
like, confusing to a fucking
nightmare.

38:41.055 --> 38:44.625
Like, how did I not remember
anything?

38:44.659 --> 38:48.361
How was I so fucked up?

38:54.869 --> 38:56.671
I remember them laughing and

38:56.704 --> 38:57.705
they were taking

38:58.471 --> 39:00.808
photos and videos because I'd
come to

39:00.842 --> 39:03.410
and seen, like, a phone in my
face.

39:07.615 --> 39:09.917
And it was fucking just a blur.
And...

39:15.823 --> 39:17.859
I'm so sorry.

39:17.892 --> 39:19.026
I'm sorry.

39:23.865 --> 39:27.134
Did, did you go to the police?

39:27.668 --> 39:28.736
I tried.

39:31.672 --> 39:33.440
So what happened to them?

39:33.473 --> 39:36.744
I tracked down

39:36.777 --> 39:40.014
the girl who invited me,
and she told me who these people
are.

39:41.582 --> 39:42.617
Nicky, they're not

39:43.017 --> 39:45.720
the kind of people
you can just get arrested

39:45.753 --> 39:47.555
and then it's over.

39:52.159 --> 39:57.798
So, you think your only option
is to...is to...

39:59.466 --> 39:59.967
leave L.A.

40:00.001 --> 40:03.671
and run from this?

40:04.739 --> 40:06.741
I can't. I can't. I...

40:08.475 --> 40:11.979
I told myself that it was over.

40:12.013 --> 40:15.182
you know, it was just like a
fuckin', a crazy

40:16.851 --> 40:19.854
fucking situation
I got myself into with people

40:20.288 --> 40:22.890
from another world
and I'd never see them again.

40:22.924 --> 40:26.127
And I would never put
myself in that position. And...

40:27.628 --> 40:30.197
they were fucking there. They
were there,

40:30.398 --> 40:31.098
Nicky.

40:31.832 --> 40:33.500
And they saw me.

40:34.735 --> 40:36.203
They saw me.

40:36.436 --> 40:36.938
OK,

40:37.905 --> 40:40.107
we'll pack up the car right now
and we'll get the fuck out of
here.

40:40.408 --> 40:41.075
We're out of here.

40:41.108 --> 40:44.145
I'm not asking you to do that.

40:58.059 --> 41:01.629
Nicky. I've never
met anyone like you.

41:06.934 --> 41:08.903
Somewhere in the middle of the
past
few weeks

41:08.936 --> 41:11.038
I fell in love with you.

41:13.841 --> 41:14.542
Me too.

41:16.077 --> 41:20.648
But, um...seeing them...

41:20.848 --> 41:24.552
It just, it made me realize it
wasn't

41:24.585 --> 41:28.255
a fucking dream or nightmare.

41:28.289 --> 41:32.059
Its real, you know, and I can't
bury it and I...

41:34.662 --> 41:36.897
They're fucking animals, Nicky.

41:37.965 --> 41:40.634
No.

41:40.668 --> 41:41.802
I can't.

41:41.836 --> 41:44.105
I can't imagine you're not here.

41:45.773 --> 41:47.074
I don't want to lose you.

41:47.108 --> 41:49.543
Don't leave, don't leave me.

41:49.577 --> 41:52.146
Because I, I, I...

41:52.446 --> 41:53.581
I need you.

41:53.614 --> 41:54.248
I do.

41:57.151 --> 42:00.121
Do you need me?

42:03.024 --> 42:05.526
Do you love me?

42:06.727 --> 42:07.561
Of course I do.

42:10.031 --> 42:10.998
Then kill them.

42:19.774 --> 42:21.709
They don't deserve to breathe.

42:29.116 --> 42:31.919
They don't deserve to
breathe.

42:38.159 --> 42:39.160
Tessa,

42:43.731 --> 42:45.599
are you hearing yourself?

42:48.235 --> 42:50.104
You're asking me to kill people.

42:54.809 --> 42:56.310
I...I ca-

42:56.343 --> 42:59.880
I'm asking you to love me enough
to protect me from animals.

43:09.223 --> 43:11.092
I...I can't.

43:12.393 --> 43:15.362
I just, I...

43:17.064 --> 43:19.100
I can't, I can't do that.

43:25.840 --> 43:29.176
Hey, hey, I understand, I
understand.

43:30.077 --> 43:30.845
Yeah. No.

43:33.147 --> 43:33.781
Yeah.

43:34.215 --> 43:36.083
Please, please, Tessa,

43:36.117 --> 43:37.618
where are you going? I don't
know.

43:37.952 --> 43:40.020
I can't stay here. Yes, you can.

43:40.054 --> 43:42.223
No, I can't. You have a choice
here.

43:42.524 --> 43:43.757
I don't have a choice. Yes, you
do. No, I don't.

43:43.791 --> 43:44.225
I don't.

43:44.258 --> 43:44.725
I fucking

43:44.758 --> 43:45.926
don't! Yes, you...

44:54.995 --> 44:56.830
Hey, how you doing?

44:56.864 --> 44:59.266
Hey, where the fuck are our
girls?

44:59.601 --> 45:01.168
I pitched our girls. But the
brand,

45:01.202 --> 45:03.170
You know, they handle casting.
They do what they want.

45:03.204 --> 45:04.705
You know how it is.

45:05.372 --> 45:06.273
Who's that?

45:06.307 --> 45:07.408
It's Vincent.

45:08.275 --> 45:10.077
Did he hire these girls?

45:10.277 --> 45:12.112
He might have had a say. It's,
look, he's great.

45:12.146 --> 45:14.248
They're great.
I talked to them. They're really
nice.

45:14.516 --> 45:17.017
Look, I know it's not what you
expected,
but they're really cool.

45:17.051 --> 45:18.018
I talked to them.

45:18.052 --> 45:20.187
No, this is...This is...This is
bullshit, Sam.

45:21.222 --> 45:23.490
Look, it's just one day.

45:24.191 --> 45:27.127
And you can just do your thing.

45:28.329 --> 45:29.863
I'll figure it out.

45:38.272 --> 45:39.173
Is he alright?

45:39.206 --> 45:40.374
Yeah, he's great.

46:10.904 --> 46:11.872
Eyes.

46:14.308 --> 46:15.376
A little to the right to the
right...

46:15.409 --> 46:16.310
to the right to the right.

46:16.343 --> 46:17.311
Right here.

46:21.115 --> 46:22.850
I want to do some blood effects
on her eyes

46:22.883 --> 46:24.385
but I don't want it to be too
theatrical.

46:24.418 --> 46:26.820
I just want a little bit
under, dripping down.

46:27.888 --> 46:30.124
Like a blanket, like a red
blanket.

46:33.093 --> 46:33.595
Faith,

46:33.628 --> 46:34.862
where's that blood?

46:48.075 --> 46:50.512
Hey man, um,
can I get a quick minute, if
that's OK?

46:50.712 --> 46:52.547
Yeah. Sorry about that. Sorry.
Sorry.

46:52.580 --> 46:53.814
Just over here. Yeah.

46:55.650 --> 46:57.217
This isn't the aesthetic we
agreed on.

46:57.251 --> 46:58.586
What are you trying to do?

46:58.787 --> 47:01.088
Yeah, I'm just going to pivot.
Pivot?

47:01.121 --> 47:02.524
She's wearing pale makeup.

47:02.557 --> 47:05.025
This is meant to be high
fashion.
What's going on here?

47:05.059 --> 47:05.859
It's going to be great.

47:07.995 --> 47:08.530
Alright?

47:09.664 --> 47:10.464
Clea, Moira,

47:10.497 --> 47:12.132
can I get you over here?

47:18.205 --> 47:18.939
Just down on here?

47:18.972 --> 47:19.507
Yeah.

47:19.541 --> 47:21.075
Let's have you lay down.

47:23.477 --> 47:24.579
Looks great.

47:26.413 --> 47:28.415
Put you over here for a sec.
Alright

47:28.449 --> 47:31.852
what I'm going to do is put you
feet
first here. Uh huh.

47:34.188 --> 47:36.190
Get you right down here.

47:36.223 --> 47:39.293
Hey, Faith, can you come here
for a sec?

47:40.227 --> 47:41.295
Looks great.

47:41.596 --> 47:42.329
Yeah.

47:44.031 --> 47:44.898
Can I...

47:47.434 --> 47:49.637
Yes.

47:49.671 --> 47:51.573
Both of you look up into...Yup.

47:51.606 --> 47:54.174
Thank you. You guys are great.

47:55.042 --> 47:57.177
Bring that arm right back where
it was.

47:57.211 --> 47:59.380
And yup...up.

47:59.748 --> 48:01.516
Hey, I want to talk about this.

48:01.549 --> 48:02.650
It's just another shoot.

48:02.684 --> 48:03.651
Fuck it.

48:05.219 --> 48:06.453
That is not what I'm talking
about and

48:06.487 --> 48:09.089
you know that. You are obviously
hurting.

48:09.123 --> 48:12.226
What's going on? It's just
fucking life,

48:18.465 --> 48:21.135
Now, she's gone.

48:21.168 --> 48:23.003
She's gone. I don't know where
the fuck

48:23.036 --> 48:25.239
she is. She's gone. Look, I'm
sorry to hear that, man,

48:25.272 --> 48:31.011
I am. OK but that shoot was not
what we had talked
about and it was some dark shit.

48:32.413 --> 48:33.615
What are you saying?

48:33.882 --> 48:35.449
You just said it was genius.

48:35.482 --> 48:36.383
and fucking Vince?

48:36.417 --> 48:39.353
He loves it. Yeah. So, what's
the issue?

48:39.386 --> 48:40.555
Yes, I did.

48:40.588 --> 48:41.756
And obviously he does.

48:41.790 --> 48:44.158
But the point is,
I don't know where it's coming
from

48:44.191 --> 48:45.492
and I'm trying to make sure that
you're OK.

48:45.527 --> 48:47.161
Just give me a fucking break,

48:47.194 --> 48:47.928
alright?

48:59.206 --> 49:00.007
Hey, it's Tessa,

49:00.040 --> 49:01.576
leave a message.

49:04.411 --> 49:05.613
Hey, it's me...um...

49:08.750 --> 49:10.652
Could you please just call me
back, huh?

49:13.187 --> 49:14.021
I just I...

49:14.656 --> 49:16.558
I got to hear your voice,
you know, I just got to know

49:16.591 --> 49:18.125
you're alright.

49:21.295 --> 49:21.962
I mean, come on

49:21.995 --> 49:23.197
this can't be it and all that.

49:23.230 --> 49:24.097
You know, you know,

49:24.131 --> 49:25.165
you know.

49:28.502 --> 49:31.205
Just please call me back,
alright?

50:29.429 --> 50:30.063
It's OK.

50:30.097 --> 50:32.232
You don't have to come back.

50:32.266 --> 50:34.368
Tessa, come back. Tessa. Tessa,
come back.

50:34.702 --> 50:36.403
Come back. Where are you? Come
back.

50:36.436 --> 50:37.672
Tessa. Where are you?

50:37.705 --> 50:38.438
Tessa.

50:39.072 --> 50:41.341
Come back
Tessa, come back.

50:43.243 --> 50:44.579
Please come back.

51:19.346 --> 51:20.147
Tessa...

51:25.185 --> 51:26.453
We've got to find another way.

51:35.162 --> 51:35.730
I can't.

51:38.833 --> 51:40.334
I can't do it.

51:54.682 --> 51:57.417
How could you say you'd protect
me and
then betray me?

51:59.219 --> 52:00.588
Betray you?

52:03.625 --> 52:04.659
Tessa, I...

52:05.026 --> 52:06.393
I love you.

52:06.426 --> 52:08.295
No, you don't. No, you don't.

52:08.328 --> 52:10.531
No. Yeah. No, you're

52:10.565 --> 52:12.165
just like everyone else, you're
leaving me.

52:12.199 --> 52:14.301
Tessa!

52:14.334 --> 52:16.203
I'm trying not to abandon you.

52:16.236 --> 52:19.507
No, I already told you who
these fucking men are, OK?

52:19.540 --> 52:23.210
And when they beat this, and
make no fucking mistake, they
will,

52:23.243 --> 52:25.312
who do you think they're going
to come after?

52:51.271 --> 52:52.272
I'll do it.

52:59.714 --> 53:01.516
But you can't stay here.

53:02.684 --> 53:04.217
I'm also going to need
everything that

53:04.251 --> 53:04.852
you got on 'em.

54:12.687 --> 54:15.022
If this cocksucker's home.

54:18.025 --> 54:18.860
Matteo!

54:23.564 --> 54:26.500
Yo, Matteo!

54:27.935 --> 54:30.037
Fucking call this guy.

54:34.709 --> 54:35.576
Thanks.

55:12.412 --> 55:13.080
Shit.

55:40.908 --> 55:43.044
Hi, uh, can I get two steak
tacos and a horchata?

58:07.054 --> 58:07.888
What's up?

58:10.024 --> 58:10.891
Yeah, nine's good.

58:12.093 --> 58:14.562
No, not tomorrow,
I need to do it tonight.

58:16.197 --> 58:16.697
Yeah, it's just a

58:16.731 --> 58:18.199
lot of shit to move.

58:29.810 --> 58:33.614
Who the fuck are you,
motherfucker?

58:34.215 --> 58:36.751
Why you following me, fucker?

59:35.810 --> 59:38.579
Alright, I'm meeting him at the
door right now.
Don't worry.

59:42.383 --> 59:43.150
Hey. Hey.

59:43.184 --> 59:44.885
You must be Nick.

59:45.119 --> 59:47.388
Thanks for getting here so
quick.

59:47.421 --> 59:50.291
We're really excited
to be working with you.

59:50.324 --> 59:52.927
I know Nemo is for sure.

59:53.562 --> 59:56.030
Uh, you can set up anywhere.

59:58.232 --> 1:00:00.634
Can I get you anything?

1:00:01.402 --> 1:00:03.904
Yeah, a water and a...

1:00:05.372 --> 1:00:07.374
a Red-eye.

1:00:08.175 --> 1:00:10.044
Yeah, of course.

1:00:43.410 --> 1:00:43.911
Nemo,

1:00:43.944 --> 1:00:44.546
we have 30 projects,

1:00:44.579 --> 1:00:46.313
I can't confirm anything.

1:00:46.347 --> 1:00:48.749
This is a solid, this is a solid
idea.

1:00:49.216 --> 1:00:50.184
It's not a solid idea. I'm not
going to approve.

1:00:50.217 --> 1:00:51.352
Find me something interesting.

1:00:51.385 --> 1:00:53.320
Otherwise, I'm not interested.

1:00:53.622 --> 1:00:56.056
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick. Nick.
Hey, man.

1:00:56.090 --> 1:00:57.758
Thanks for doing this last
minute.
I appreciate it.

1:00:57.791 --> 1:00:59.994
I really do. You know, it's
like I said on the message, I
want you to

1:01:03.130 --> 1:01:05.299
run with this. Nick, Nick, you
with me?

1:01:05.332 --> 1:01:06.734
What happened to your lip?

1:01:08.435 --> 1:01:09.103
Huh?

1:01:10.204 --> 1:01:11.906
Oh yeah, I get it.

1:01:12.173 --> 1:01:13.774
Art.

1:01:13.807 --> 1:01:15.843
Oh, Sammy, where's Sammy?

1:01:17.845 --> 1:01:19.046
Oh, she's sick.

1:01:19.079 --> 1:01:20.281
Well, who brought these girls?

1:01:20.314 --> 1:01:22.049
Are these? Sasha? Yeah.

1:01:22.082 --> 1:01:23.350
The fuck are these girls?

1:01:23.384 --> 1:01:24.418
We had to book them last minute.

1:01:24.451 --> 1:01:26.787
We booked them? Yeah. But
they're fine.
Shhh.

1:01:26.820 --> 1:01:27.855
Don't embarrass them.

1:01:28.389 --> 1:01:29.256
Nick.

1:01:29.456 --> 1:01:30.758
Hey, listen to me.

1:01:31.425 --> 1:01:32.927
Do you like these girls? I can
change these girls

1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:34.461
If you don't like these girls.
Don't be shy.

1:01:34.495 --> 1:01:37.264
Just tell me the truth.
I can give a fuck about these
girls. I can get you

1:01:37.298 --> 1:01:38.098
nice girls.

1:01:38.132 --> 1:01:38.633
No, they're great.

1:01:38.667 --> 1:01:41.335
You sure? Yeah. OK.

1:01:42.169 --> 1:01:43.137
Be free.

1:01:45.406 --> 1:01:46.840
Inspire me.

1:01:55.482 --> 1:01:57.318
Why you following me, fucker?

1:01:59.954 --> 1:02:01.355
These are the best shoes
in the fucking world,

1:02:01.388 --> 1:02:03.791
alright? Knife up
like you've held a knife before.

1:02:03.824 --> 1:02:04.959
Yeah, right there.

1:02:06.093 --> 1:02:07.928
What the fuck do you want?

1:02:07.962 --> 1:02:10.264
You thought you could fuck with
me, huh?

1:02:10.297 --> 1:02:11.298
Just be natural

1:02:11.332 --> 1:02:13.867
that's all I fucking need,
alright? Don't act.

1:02:14.101 --> 1:02:16.303
Be natural. Alright?

1:02:16.337 --> 1:02:17.838
Fuck you.

1:02:18.172 --> 1:02:21.308
Close, close, close, fucking
closing.

1:02:35.889 --> 1:02:44.031
Groaning

1:02:44.532 --> 1:02:47.268
Groaning

1:03:20.267 --> 1:03:22.269
I'm asking you this one time.

1:03:22.537 --> 1:03:23.772
Why'd you kill Victor?

1:03:23.804 --> 1:03:26.840
What the fuck do you want from
us?
I don't know anything!

1:03:26.874 --> 1:03:28.242
It was a fucking accident!

1:03:28.275 --> 1:03:30.844
It was an accident! Tell me what
you're
talking about...I don't know!

1:03:30.878 --> 1:03:32.846
I don't kn- Why?

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:41.288
FUCK!

1:03:41.322 --> 1:03:44.391

fucking phone,

1:04:08.315 --> 1:04:10.351
pick up your fucking phone.

1:04:10.384 --> 1:04:11.485
Pick it.

1:04:13.420 --> 1:04:16.323
Hey, it's Tessa, leave a
message.

1:04:16.357 --> 1:04:22.429
Tessa. Tessa, it's
Nicky.

1:04:35.042 --> 1:04:38.445
Where the fuck are you?
Pick up your fucking phone!

1:05:19.319 --> 1:05:22.089
Hey, Ma.

1:05:22.423 --> 1:05:23.591
Yeah. No, no, I'm fine...

1:05:23.625 --> 1:05:24.158
I'm fine.

1:05:24.191 --> 1:05:26.493
Yeah, I'm just calling

1:05:28.362 --> 1:05:29.531
I uh...

1:05:29.898 --> 1:05:31.599
I just miss you, that's all.

1:05:31.633 --> 1:05:32.132
You know?

1:05:32.166 --> 1:05:33.535
I miss you and uh...

1:05:37.037 --> 1:05:37.471
Yeah.

1:05:37.505 --> 1:05:38.606
No, no, don't...

1:05:41.375 --> 1:05:43.110
Don't worry about me, you know?

1:05:43.143 --> 1:05:45.012
Yeah, is Pop there?

1:05:45.045 --> 1:05:45.513
Let me. I just.
