01:39.060 --> 01:43.200
Wind speeds topping 140 miles an hour,

01:43.200 --> 01:46.240
this storm is cutting a path of
destruction along the gulf coast.

01:46.240 --> 01:51.100
it’s been pouring rain for hours,
with almost zero visibility.

01:51.100 --> 01:54.340
Collapsed structures have
trapped people and widespread

01:54.340 --> 01:57.300
flooding has isolated residential areas.

01:57.300 --> 02:01.390
Frantic calls to 911 have
overcome the emergency system.

02:01.390 --> 02:06.500
Anyone who chose to remain in the city or
somehow did not get the evacuation order,

02:06.500 --> 02:09.550
they must rescue themselves at this
point or they will need to ride out

02:09.550 --> 02:13.580
the storm until rescuers can
get to them once again.

02:13.580 --> 02:18.620
As for now, as you can see the
conditions are just too treacherous.

03:04.850 --> 03:06.910
You be careful.

03:06.910 --> 03:10.970
How long will you be gone?

05:11.240 --> 05:14.290
Madison.

05:14.290 --> 05:18.360
Did I wake you? No. You didn't.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.380
Same dream?

05:21.380 --> 05:23.420
No.

05:23.420 --> 05:25.430
Do you need me to come over there?

05:25.430 --> 05:28.470
No. But will you talk to
me until I fall asleep?

05:28.470 --> 05:31.520
Of course, what do you
want to hear this time?

05:31.520 --> 05:34.540
When mom and dad met at the wine party.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.580
Well, your dad and I were

05:37.580 --> 05:40.610
having a small get-together
at our apartment.

05:40.610 --> 05:44.630
Your mom was a friend of a friend.

05:44.630 --> 05:46.670
And you didn't know her, right?

05:46.670 --> 05:49.750
That's right. Neither one
of us had ever met her.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.770
She wasn't supposed to come to the party,

05:52.770 --> 05:53.820
but at the last minute

05:53.820 --> 05:58.870
she decided to come because all
her plans fell through in Napa.

05:59.870 --> 06:01.360
We didn't have Syrah that night.

06:01.360 --> 06:05.300
The Beaujoulais Nouveau just came in.

07:27.760 --> 07:31.800
Packed up your desk with the
files you requested. Oh, thanks.

07:31.800 --> 07:35.810
Is that still your hobby, maps? Didn't
your parents do something like that?

07:35.810 --> 07:39.830
Storm chasers. Something like that.

07:39.830 --> 07:43.880
What about that map? Did
they figure anything out?

07:43.880 --> 07:47.980
No, not before they... I'm sorry.

07:47.980 --> 07:52.030
It's okay.

07:52.030 --> 07:56.090
So, New Orleans? Yeah. Have you been?

07:56.090 --> 08:00.180
Never. I love Nawlins.

08:00.180 --> 08:04.200
Nawlins? Is that how they say it?

08:04.200 --> 08:08.310
Hey. Oh, sure you don't need a
ride to the airport. Not flying.

08:08.310 --> 08:12.370
You're kidding? Doc insists on
escorting me. And he doesn't fly.

08:12.370 --> 08:16.390
Have him take you on one of those
ghost tours while he's there.

08:16.390 --> 08:20.430
I'm not into that voodoo stuff.
Maybe Doc will be.

08:20.430 --> 08:24.520
You know, put a curse on people.
Talk to the dead.

08:24.520 --> 08:28.570
Chicken feet dangling from the ceiling.
You're terrible.

08:28.570 --> 08:32.630
Maybe it'll loosen him up. I doubt it.

08:32.630 --> 08:36.650
What's so funny? Nothing. Anymore boxes?

08:36.650 --> 08:40.720
No, that's the last one. What is this?

08:42.700 --> 08:46.910
Some of mom and dad's old stuff.

08:46.910 --> 08:50.960
Relics. Yeah.

08:50.960 --> 08:53.990
So where does it go?

08:53.990 --> 08:56.050
Actually you know, I'll take that with me.

08:56.050 --> 08:58.080
Hey, call me when you get in.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.100
Bye sweetie. Take care.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.150
Have a safe trip, Doc.

09:03.150 --> 09:06.150
I don't like it when she calls me that.

09:06.150 --> 09:08.220
It's disrespectful.

09:11.970 --> 09:13.990
Why? I call you that.

09:13.990 --> 09:17.010
Yeah, that's different. I've always like
to pretend it mean uncle coming from you.

09:17.010 --> 09:22.060
Yeah, but we're not related. I'm
your guardian. I'm not 14 anymore,

09:22.060 --> 09:25.080
I'm an adult.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.030
But I'll always look after you. I know,

09:27.030 --> 09:30.390
as soon as I get things going
down there, I'll be back.

09:30.390 --> 09:33.190
Ready?

10:07.560 --> 10:11.560
Hey, Tricia. What the hell
are you doing here, Roger?

10:11.560 --> 10:13.580
I'm here to pick up Katie.

10:13.580 --> 10:16.600
Well, she's not here. What do
you mean, "she's not here"?

10:16.600 --> 10:19.640
She left with her daddy. I'm her daddy.

10:19.640 --> 10:23.660
Did he take her to school again?
This is the third time.

10:23.660 --> 10:26.168
I just drove two hours. I
woke up at 4 o'clock this

10:26.180 --> 10:28.700
morning so I'd be here on time.
This was scheduled.

10:28.700 --> 10:32.730
Have you been drinking. No.

10:32.730 --> 10:35.780
I haven't. Come back tomorrow.

10:35.780 --> 10:38.840
You know it ain't that easy. You
purposely moved two hours away.

10:38.840 --> 10:42.870
Well, you could have moved too.
My work's in New Orleans.

10:42.870 --> 10:44.878
Oh, that's right, you
build mobile homes.

10:44.890 --> 10:46.910
It's modular construction,
not mobile homes.

10:46.910 --> 10:50.960
It's the same thing and you can do
that here. It's where the work is.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.463
Well, you chose and you
made your decision.

10:53.475 --> 10:55.990
Tricia... Actually, don't
come back here again.

10:55.990 --> 10:59.050
I want to see my daughter.
Take me to court.

11:22.320 --> 11:26.370
Daddy! How's my little girl? Good.

11:26.370 --> 11:30.520
When am I coming to your house?
Soon, sweetheart. Soon.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.580
Do I have a room? You sure do,
it's real pretty just like you.

11:34.580 --> 11:38.600
I miss you.

11:38.600 --> 11:42.670
I miss you too.

12:02.980 --> 12:04.060
I know it's been years, but we have to make
sure the ward can sustain development.

12:04.060 --> 12:08.090
People are out of their homes for a reason.

12:08.090 --> 12:11.120
But for how long, Mayor?

12:11.120 --> 12:15.200
As long as it take to restore order.
It's dangerous right now.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.213
Squatters, looters,
unsafe structures. Mayor

12:17.225 --> 12:19.250
Bennett, what about
the disappearances?

12:19.250 --> 12:23.310
The disappearances are under investigation.
This is the fifth disappearance month.

12:23.310 --> 12:27.390
As mayor of our beloved New Orleans,

12:27.390 --> 12:31.410
I'll get to the bottom of this.
One step at a time though.

12:31.410 --> 12:35.410
That's all for now. Mayor!
Mayor! We need answers.

12:35.410 --> 12:37.470
Where are you going?

12:37.470 --> 12:43.640
You seriously have never flown on a plane?
Never. Why?

12:43.640 --> 12:47.720
Birds fly, not humans.
That's ridiculous, Doc.

12:47.720 --> 12:51.800
Why fly when it's so nice to drive?
Because it takes like five times

12:51.800 --> 12:55.830
as long to get anywhere. Well, it gives me
five times as much time to spend with you.

13:02.910 --> 13:04.010
Was this the way?

13:04.030 --> 13:08.070
They took road trips all over the country.

13:08.070 --> 13:12.140
This was the road? I mean, this is
where their notes stop on the map.

13:12.140 --> 13:16.160
Yes, um, they were coming
back up from the south.

13:16.160 --> 13:20.210
And, uh, they took this road.

13:44.510 --> 13:48.530
Hmm.

13:51.530 --> 13:52.540
What's that?

13:52.540 --> 13:56.590
Research on tremors in the bay area.

13:56.590 --> 14:00.640
Not your thing, huh? What's up there?

14:00.640 --> 14:04.670
I don't know. You didn't ask?

14:06.670 --> 14:10.730
Well, I didn't get the grand tour.

14:10.730 --> 14:12.810
How did you find out about this place?

14:12.810 --> 14:16.830
Online. It's kind of a dump.

14:16.830 --> 14:20.890
It's okay, it's close to work.
If you need money...

14:20.890 --> 14:24.900
Oh, I'm good, Doc. When do you start work?

14:24.900 --> 14:26.908
I don't know, I meet
with the director

14:26.920 --> 14:28.940
tomorrow and he's going
to tell me where I go.

14:28.940 --> 14:32.970
I presume it's the ward that's
never been rebuilt. Hmm.

14:32.970 --> 14:36.980
Hey, Lew.

14:36.980 --> 14:41.020
I assume you are the owner
of this lovely place. Hello.

14:41.020 --> 14:45.080
Uh, this is my uncle, Dr. Leland Garr.
Doctor? What kind of doctor?

14:45.080 --> 14:48.110
I've been having terrible
sleeping problems.

14:48.110 --> 14:52.150
I'm not that kind of a doctor.
What kind of doctor are you?

14:52.150 --> 14:57.190
Doctor of religion, sorry. Kind
of confusing that doctor title.

14:57.190 --> 15:01.200
What's up there? Attic.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.260
What's in the attic?

15:03.260 --> 15:06.293
All kinds of stuff. I keep it locked.
Nobody's

15:06.305 --> 15:09.350
been up there in years.
Is that right?

15:09.350 --> 15:11.390
Doc.

15:11.390 --> 15:13.390
It's time for America's
Funniest Home Videos.

15:13.390 --> 15:17.450
I love that show. Nice to meet
you, Doctor "not that kind" Garr.

15:17.450 --> 15:21.550
Madison, I'll be seeing you around.
Alright. Bye, Lew.

15:21.550 --> 15:25.580
I told you, there's nothing to worry about.

15:25.580 --> 15:29.620
What are you, kidding?
He's obviously a lunatic.

15:29.620 --> 15:33.680
Who still watches that show?

15:33.680 --> 15:37.710
This is the stuff form
your folks' attic. Yeah.

15:41.760 --> 15:45.790
Childhood stuff.

15:46.820 --> 15:49.880
"Most likely."

15:49.880 --> 15:53.950
"Most likely" to fall in on you.

15:53.950 --> 15:57.950
It's a dump.

15:57.950 --> 15:59.000
I'll be back, okay?

15:59.000 --> 16:04.040
You sure you're going to be
alright, baby girl. Yeah, sure.

16:13.110 --> 16:15.110
You'll be working with the
contractor who won the bid.

16:15.110 --> 16:17.668
Everyone in the ward needs to be vacated.
Some of the

16:17.680 --> 16:20.250
houses have been marked for demolition.
But not all.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.253
Why has it taken so long?
Things don't happen

16:22.265 --> 16:24.280
over night. Maybe that's
been your experience

16:24.280 --> 16:26.320
in the past.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.390
No, it hasn't. But there is a
possibility of rebuilding?

16:30.390 --> 16:33.420
A storm came. Levee broke, washed
everything and everyone out.

16:33.420 --> 16:36.470
And if it's not, you can just
note that and be on your way.

16:36.470 --> 16:40.490
There are a few people still living
in the ward in damaged homes.

16:40.490 --> 16:44.520
And squatters. Did I say that already?
We can't do anything until they're gone.

16:44.520 --> 16:48.580
Everyone's given up on that ward.

16:48.580 --> 16:53.600
Evaluate the soil and water. And let me
know if she can be rebuilt. Eugenia!

16:55.600 --> 16:57.620
Could you check to see where
that contractor is? Yes.

16:57.620 --> 17:01.670
And get the files for Madison.
Right way, Mr. O'Reilly.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.810
That'll be all.

17:22.849 --> 17:26.940
Thank you.

17:26.940 --> 17:31.020
That's all? I'm afraid so.
After all these years?

17:31.020 --> 17:33.023
That's all I have to give you.
But the

17:33.035 --> 17:35.050
contractor is waiting downstairs.
Okay, thanks.

17:41.130 --> 17:42.130
So you won the bid?

17:42.130 --> 17:46.180
Been trying for months now. Competing
with all kinds of contractors.

17:46.180 --> 17:49.250
Just trying to get things back on track.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.253
That's great they have
a program that allows

17:51.265 --> 17:53.280
independent contractors
to get guaranteed work.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.280
And guaranteed payment.

17:55.280 --> 17:59.320
Aw, crap. I can fix that.

17:59.320 --> 18:03.390
You're a jeweler too?

18:03.390 --> 18:05.410
I am a man of many trades.

18:05.410 --> 18:07.410
No, it's okay.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.500
It's a nice necklace.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.530
Thanks. My parents gave it to me.

18:16.530 --> 18:20.530
Cool. Your parents gave you
jewelry, mine kicked me out.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.530
You close to your parents?

18:22.530 --> 18:25.560
They're gone. I'm sorry.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.620
Kitch? That's a nice name.

18:27.620 --> 18:29.618
Yeah, friends gave it to me.
When my wife left,

18:29.630 --> 18:31.640
she took everything by
the kitchen sink and me.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.690
My real name is Roger.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.820
So, why'd you stop?

18:45.820 --> 18:47.820
We'll have to walk from here.
Mud is getting kinda deep.

18:58.950 --> 19:00.990
Gosh,

19:01.990 --> 19:03.990
I didn't know it was this bad here.

19:03.990 --> 19:08.120
This is our dumping ground. Seriously?

19:08.120 --> 19:12.180
Yeah, instead of driving down to the
city dump, contractors have been

19:12.180 --> 19:16.190
sweeping trailers full of debris down here.
All kinds of stuff, you name it.

19:16.190 --> 19:20.220
We need to get movin', I don't
wanna be here after dark.

19:20.220 --> 19:22.260
Okay.

19:32.360 --> 19:34.430
Where is this water coming from?

19:34.430 --> 19:38.430
Beside from the rain, ward
don't even have running water.

19:38.430 --> 19:39.430
What's that?

19:39.430 --> 19:41.918
It's a water and soil test kit.
I need to take some

19:41.930 --> 19:44.430
samples. See what stuff was
left over from the flood water.

19:44.430 --> 19:48.520
Sometimes all kinds of things get dredged
up leaving the foundation unstable.

19:48.520 --> 19:54.540
The water may be contaminated
with sewage or animal waste.

19:54.540 --> 19:57.540
Chemicals from the rain, roads, farms,

19:57.540 --> 20:00.640
storage buildings,
sediment and other stuff.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.680
If the surrounding ground is saturated it
may create uneven pressure on the system's

20:04.680 --> 20:08.740
foundation resulting in
cracking or even collapsing.

20:08.740 --> 20:12.770
You know your stuff. Sorry. You
probably know this already.

20:12.770 --> 20:16.790
Not as much as you.

20:18.790 --> 20:22.830
So what are those markings over there?

20:22.830 --> 20:26.890
When a house is cleared for demolition,
it's marked with that x there.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.920
Contractor shorthand.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.990
And why are those markings there different.
Not familiar with those.

20:32.990 --> 20:37.080
Somebody else's shorthand,
not sure what those mean.

20:37.080 --> 20:41.120
Why don't we start at the end of the
block and work our way up. Okay.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.600
Uh. These overhangs aren't supported.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.600
Stay here. I'm going make sure
it's safe for you to enter.

21:30.600 --> 21:33.640
I can determine that.

21:33.640 --> 21:37.660
I'll just make sure no one's inside.

22:09.090 --> 22:13.170
Is anyone in there? Can I come in?

22:30.520 --> 22:34.540
How does it look?

22:40.630 --> 22:44.680
Shit! What is it?

22:44.680 --> 22:46.680
Snake.

22:46.680 --> 22:50.740
Didn't I tell you to wait outside?

22:50.740 --> 22:54.810
I'm not good with commands.
Can you please wait outside?

22:54.810 --> 22:56.860
No.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.020
This room and water are nasty.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.080
Don't move. Why? I'm not afraid of snakes.

23:15.080 --> 23:18.160
Don't take another step!

23:18.160 --> 23:22.200
That whole area is wood rot. It'll
cave right in if you walk on it.

23:26.270 --> 23:29.300
Don't move.

23:32.300 --> 23:35.320
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

23:35.320 --> 23:39.350
Take your right food and
move it back two inches.

23:47.480 --> 23:51.510
How did you know?

23:59.570 --> 24:03.640
Cuboidal cracking. Cubes
start to form in the wood.

24:03.640 --> 24:07.660
That's one way to tell.

24:07.660 --> 24:11.710
That piece over there is all fibrous.

24:11.710 --> 24:15.780
On appearance it looks stable.

24:15.780 --> 24:19.800
But, put a little pressure on
it, it's as soft as tissue.

24:19.800 --> 24:23.820
You'll fall right through. When
walking into a damaged house,

24:23.820 --> 24:27.900
always look before you step.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.190
I don't think anyone's living here.

24:35.190 --> 24:37.230
Careful.

25:15.610 --> 25:19.630
That's strange. Yeah, because it's
the only house standing, right?

25:19.630 --> 25:21.670
Yeah.

25:21.670 --> 25:25.740
Looks like she jumped right over this one.

25:25.740 --> 25:29.750
Not foot or tire tracks. Just ours.

25:47.910 --> 25:51.950
Yes. Can I help you? Hi ma'am.
My name is Madison Richards

25:51.950 --> 25:54.020
and I'm with the US Army Corps. And
this is our contractor Kitch Jones.

25:54.020 --> 25:57.090
We're here to assess the damage in
the area to see if we can rebuild.

25:57.090 --> 26:01.110
No damage here.

26:01.110 --> 26:06.140
Ma'am, we just have to make sure.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.303
I know it's been some time,
but I assure you that

26:16.315 --> 26:18.330
our office is determined
to rebuild this area

26:18.330 --> 26:22.380
to the way it was. To the way it was?

26:22.380 --> 26:26.450
Tea? No, thank you.

26:26.450 --> 26:32.470
But in the meantime, modular housing.
I'll take a cup please.

26:34.530 --> 26:38.560
Thank you, ma'am. You're welcome.

26:48.640 --> 26:52.670
You do any renovations?

26:52.670 --> 26:56.690
No, I never needed to. Unbelievable.

26:56.690 --> 27:00.750
There's no structural damage at all.
Well, I was one of the fortunate ones.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.750
The only one.

27:02.750 --> 27:06.790
You know, someone from your office
comes here at least once a year.

27:06.790 --> 27:10.860
Surveyors, like you. Or more voyeurs.

27:10.860 --> 27:14.880
They ask the same questions and
I give them the same answers.

27:14.880 --> 27:18.910
You never see or hear from them again.

27:18.910 --> 27:22.940
Then you come,

27:22.940 --> 27:26.100
like it's all brand new. Meanwhile
we've been here all this time.

27:26.100 --> 27:30.130
They want us to leave
this ward, but I won't.

27:30.130 --> 27:34.150
I won't go. I thought you
said you lived alone?

27:34.150 --> 27:38.170
Yes. Why?

27:38.170 --> 27:42.210
I thought I just saw someone.

27:44.300 --> 27:48.340
Sorry, I was looking at my phone.
There's no reception in here.

27:48.340 --> 27:52.300
No, ma'am, there is not.

27:52.300 --> 27:56.340
Have you heard from any
of the other neighbors.

27:56.340 --> 28:00.410
No, they never returned.

28:03.410 --> 28:07.550
Your family from around here. No, Ms.
Legaux, I'm from Northern California.

28:07.550 --> 28:10.490
Sophie. Sophie.

28:10.490 --> 28:12.550
Seemed like you'd have some roots here.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.710
So how have you managed

28:23.710 --> 28:26.790
to live here with no electricity
and no running water?

28:26.790 --> 28:30.810
Well, I clean the well water.

28:30.810 --> 28:36.850
Well water? Yes. From the floodwater?

28:36.850 --> 28:38.860
Yes.

28:38.860 --> 28:41.733
I'm quite sufficient. All
my needs are met here.

28:41.745 --> 28:44.630
I have a garden in the
back with a few chickens.

28:44.630 --> 28:48.640
A sturdy gate. And a shotgun.

28:48.640 --> 28:52.710
Like a pioneer. Much like a pioneer.

28:52.710 --> 28:54.790
We've taken up enough of your time.

28:54.790 --> 28:58.810
Well, thank you very much.
You're quite welcome.

29:04.850 --> 29:08.890
What makes you different from
all the others who have come?

29:08.890 --> 29:10.920
Um...

29:10.920 --> 29:14.950
I'm going to get the job done.

29:14.950 --> 29:17.463
No doubt, you're different.
You'll come back

29:17.475 --> 29:20.000
to let me know, won't
you, if that changes?

29:20.000 --> 29:24.020
Yes, of course.

29:24.020 --> 29:26.080
Alright, Ms. Legaux.

29:42.170 --> 29:46.220
Hello? Is anyone in there?

29:50.250 --> 29:54.320
I'll check around here.

29:58.350 --> 30:02.400
I don't think anybody lives here.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.450
You know, it has those same markings,
and not the contractor ones. Madison?

30:06.450 --> 30:10.470
I see...I see something.

30:55.990 --> 30:58.050
Kitch! He went out the window.

30:58.050 --> 31:00.050
He has my bag!

31:11.100 --> 31:15.140
Kitch!

31:15.140 --> 31:19.190
Kitch! Kitch!

31:21.190 --> 31:23.210
Kitch!

31:23.210 --> 31:25.230
Kitch!

31:25.230 --> 31:29.230
Hey, hey, it's okay. It's me.

31:29.230 --> 31:33.250
You okay? Did you see who it was?

31:33.250 --> 31:38.270
No. Was that guy blue? I'm not sure.

31:38.270 --> 31:43.330
He looked blue. Okay, sometimes twilight
can play tricks with your eyes.

31:43.330 --> 31:46.360
Anyway, he's gone.

31:46.360 --> 31:50.390
My bag. Here, he dropped it.

31:53.430 --> 31:57.430
Is everything in there?
Samples are still here.

31:59.450 --> 32:03.490
My necklace is gone. What, you sure?

32:03.490 --> 32:07.530
It's not here.

32:07.530 --> 32:11.560
Shit! I’m sorry.

32:11.560 --> 32:15.590
It’s okay. Come on.

32:28.670 --> 32:31.710
He lives here.

32:33.710 --> 32:36.740
Don't matter, we can mark
this house for teardown.

32:36.740 --> 32:39.780
He shouldn't be here anyway.

32:39.780 --> 32:43.860
Let's keep it moving. It's getting dark.
I want to get out of here. Okay.

32:55.970 --> 33:00.030
What is it?

33:00.030 --> 33:04.090
It's a picture of me and my parents.

33:12.140 --> 33:14.163
There's some homeless guy
with a digital camera.

33:14.175 --> 33:16.210
It's not going to exactly
make the 10 o'clock news.

33:16.210 --> 33:18.213
But it was a picture of my
and my parents. I don't

33:18.225 --> 33:20.240
know, it's not so grave
that you can't do your job.

33:20.240 --> 33:24.290
I mean, you do want the job, right?

33:24.290 --> 33:28.340
I've got 30 guys lined up for this job.
I don't need you seeing blue men.

33:28.340 --> 33:32.360
How long have been trying
for this job, Kitch?

33:32.360 --> 33:38.280
I know what I saw. Right, Kitch?

33:38.280 --> 33:42.310
I don't know what I saw.

33:42.310 --> 33:46.330
Yeah, that's what I thought. Look,
he probably heard you were coming.

33:46.330 --> 33:50.360
The press is going crazy with
the possibility of rebuilding

33:50.360 --> 33:54.410
and with this open contractor program.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

33:54.410 --> 33:58.500
I have a meeting with the mayor.

33:58.500 --> 34:02.520
You must be Madison Richards
and Kitch Jones. Mayor.

34:02.520 --> 34:06.580
Looking forward to seeing what you
come up with. We're working on it.

34:06.580 --> 34:10.650
Everything okay? Yeah.

34:10.650 --> 34:14.699
Everything's fine. Ready for that meeting?

34:14.699 --> 34:18.750
Yeah. Alright, let's go.

34:22.760 --> 34:26.780
What was that? Nothing. There was a picture
of Madison Richards in one of the houses.

34:30.810 --> 34:32.920
There isn't anything I should
know about, is there? Richards?

34:32.920 --> 34:34.949
I don't know.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.958
I'm going to check the
files to see if anyone

34:38.969 --> 34:40.989
else has experienced
anything like this.

34:40.989 --> 34:44.040
The picture or the blue guy?

34:44.040 --> 34:46.060
Both.

34:46.060 --> 34:50.120
And I know what I saw, it wasn't twilight.

34:50.120 --> 34:57.130
And something tells me that those
symbols were not contractor shorthand.

35:27.430 --> 35:29.100
Lew?

36:11.230 --> 36:14.320
You're back. I didn't mean to scare you.

36:14.320 --> 36:18.340
Want to join me for cookies?
No thanks. The --

36:18.340 --> 36:22.380
The what? Nothing.

36:22.380 --> 36:24.440
Good night.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.890
Oh!

37:49.890 --> 37:52.920
Is everything okay? There's...there's
somebody in the walls.

37:52.920 --> 37:56.010
Well, animals crawl from the trees into
the attic. But I keep that locked.

37:56.010 --> 38:00.040
No, no, the attic was open.

38:19.150 --> 38:22.190
It’s locked. See.

38:22.190 --> 38:26.260
I'll get the key and we can go take a look.

38:26.260 --> 38:30.280
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

38:45.470 --> 38:47.510
This house...

38:47.510 --> 38:51.550
It's not haunted if that's what you think.
I know you can go on those ghost tours.

38:51.550 --> 38:54.620
I can assure you,
generations have lived here

38:54.620 --> 39:00.670
and died old and happily
surrounded by their loved ones.

39:00.670 --> 39:04.690
No disgruntled deceased here.

39:04.690 --> 39:08.740
How can you be sure?
That's it's not haunted?

39:08.740 --> 39:11.760
I’ve been here a long time.

39:11.760 --> 39:15.800
But it's a little too big for me.

39:15.800 --> 39:21.890
I like the company. Yeah, I know what
it's like living in a big house.

39:21.890 --> 39:25.910
It can be isolating. Especially at night.

39:31.930 --> 39:34.980
But I like the company as well.

39:37.010 --> 39:41.040
See, nothing. Are you satisfied?

39:41.040 --> 39:44.060
I'm the only one with a key.

39:44.060 --> 39:47.120
Let's have cookies.

40:11.330 --> 40:15.370
Another cookie? Last one. Thanks.

40:15.370 --> 40:19.410
So tell me about the ninth ward.
It's not safe.

40:19.410 --> 40:23.450
Yeah, water damage, infrastructure support.

40:23.450 --> 40:27.470
It’s never been safe. The
rich live behind big gates

40:27.470 --> 40:31.540
and the middle class have left.
All you're left with is

40:31.540 --> 40:35.550
the poor. And crime.

40:35.550 --> 40:39.590
And whatever else. Nothing
like New Orleans,

40:39.590 --> 40:43.620
there's no place I'd rather be.
It's a vibe,

40:43.620 --> 40:47.630
it's a feeling.

40:47.630 --> 40:51.660
I'm going to go to bed now.

41:40.490 --> 41:44.530
Hey Cindy, it's me. Can I
text you a picture for doc?

41:44.530 --> 41:48.570
Yeah, he still doesn't
have email or cell phone.

41:48.570 --> 41:50.580
Alright, thank you.

42:05.730 --> 42:07.760
Hey, Kitch.

42:07.760 --> 42:11.730
Yeah, I'd love to join you for a drink.
Sounds great.

42:11.730 --> 42:15.730
Sure. Yeah, I'll see you there.

42:15.730 --> 42:16.760
Alright. Bye.

42:28.810 --> 42:31.860
Hey, Lew, I thought you went to bed.

42:31.860 --> 42:35.880
Can't sleep. Why are you
sitting in the dark?

42:35.880 --> 42:39.910
I keep the lights off this time of year.
We have breaking news

42:39.910 --> 42:43.930
another person has gone
missing without a trace.

42:43.930 --> 42:47.970
This marks the sixth in a
string of disappearances over

42:47.970 --> 42:49.020
the last several months.

42:49.020 --> 42:52.020
Can't sleep either?

42:52.020 --> 42:54.060
Think I'm still on west coast time.

42:54.060 --> 42:58.090
Want to join me for some television?
We can catch the Late Late Show.

42:58.090 --> 43:02.110
No, thanks, I gotta go meet a friend.
Actually a co-worker.

43:02.110 --> 43:04.150
I see.

43:04.150 --> 43:07.230
You be careful.

43:07.230 --> 43:10.270
Yeah. Thanks.

43:14.310 --> 43:18.340
Crazy day today. Yeah.

43:18.340 --> 43:22.390
Yeah, can I get you a drink?
Oh, great yeah. Uh.

43:22.390 --> 43:26.410
Whiskey sour would be great. Whiskey sour

43:26.410 --> 43:28.470
and a diet coke, Allen.

43:28.470 --> 43:32.540
Diet coke? You're going
to make me drink alone?

43:32.540 --> 43:36.560
I've done my share.

43:36.560 --> 43:40.610
Six months sober.

43:40.610 --> 43:44.690
So why are we meeting at a bar?

43:44.690 --> 43:48.730
Uh, best crawfish

43:48.730 --> 43:52.790
and dirty rice in town,
believe it or not. And darts.

43:52.790 --> 43:55.830
You play? Do you play?

43:55.830 --> 44:00.860
Is that a challenge? I like a challenge.
I wasn't challenging you.

44:00.860 --> 44:04.920
You backing down now? I never back down.

44:04.920 --> 44:08.950
Okay. Ladies first.

44:11.970 --> 44:12.040
Thank you, sir.

44:20.060 --> 44:24.100
You ready? Have at it.

44:31.190 --> 44:34.230
Good shot.

44:36.230 --> 44:39.300
How long did you have a problem?

44:39.300 --> 44:43.310
Long enough to lose my daughter.

44:43.310 --> 44:47.360
Sorry. Yeah, me too.

44:47.360 --> 44:53.410
Me and her mother were never good together,

44:53.410 --> 44:57.470
but I could have been better.

44:57.470 --> 45:01.510
What's your daughter's name?

45:01.510 --> 45:03.540
It's Katie. Katherine Marie.

45:03.540 --> 45:06.570
But she likes going by Katie.

45:06.570 --> 45:09.610
Katie, that's a pretty name. Thank you.

45:09.610 --> 45:12.680
So do you get to see her?

45:12.680 --> 45:15.680
Trying. Finish this job

45:15.680 --> 45:20.680
and a few months of sobriety hopefully
I'll get a chance to get her back.

45:20.680 --> 45:22.740
You're on the right track.

45:22.740 --> 45:27.970
Yeah, well I hope so.
It's been a long road.

45:29.970 --> 45:31.990
You find anything in those files?

45:31.990 --> 45:36.010
Not much. There was a symbol though.

45:36.010 --> 45:40.030
Yeah? What did it look like?

45:40.030 --> 45:44.080
Similar to the demo symbols, but I
don't know, slightly different.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.078
I've never seen it before.
Voodoo? I'm not

45:46.090 --> 45:48.100
sure. I can't find
anything remotely like it.

45:48.100 --> 45:52.180
So I sent it to my uncle to check it out.

45:52.180 --> 45:56.270
The library's got old books.
We can check there too.

45:56.270 --> 45:58.290
Great, and I'll check the
files at the office.

45:58.290 --> 46:02.340
You really suck at darts.

46:02.340 --> 46:06.400
I never said I was good. I
said I like a challenge.

46:06.400 --> 46:10.450
Just keep practicing. Touché.

46:10.450 --> 46:14.470
Thank you.

46:26.580 --> 46:30.620
How are we going to do this? Excuse me?

46:30.620 --> 46:34.640
I didn't mean that. I meant,

46:34.640 --> 46:38.660
how are we going to actually get
work done in the ward after today?

46:42.710 --> 46:46.800
What is it? It's my predecessor.

46:48.800 --> 46:52.830
Missing persons? Do you know him?

46:52.830 --> 46:55.870
No, I tried calling him.

46:55.870 --> 46:58.368
Do you think he went
missing on the job? Here?

46:58.380 --> 47:00.890
I’m not sure. I'm going
to see if I can get

47:00.890 --> 47:04.920
in contact with my other predecessors.
I have to go. No problem. Go.

48:05.530 --> 48:09.550
Getting closer to what the
significance of the ward is.

48:09.550 --> 48:13.610
Levees will not be able to sustain
next storm. They must be warned.

48:13.610 --> 48:17.660
Talk to the residents.

48:30.860 --> 48:33.900
Not safe here. Hmm.

48:53.260 --> 48:55.320
Oh! Oh!

48:55.320 --> 49:00.360
Oh! Oh!

49:12.570 --> 49:15.550
Oh! Ouch!

49:15.550 --> 49:19.570
They're attracted to light.
Termites are attracted to light.

49:19.570 --> 49:23.660
It's okay. It's okay, it happens.

49:23.660 --> 49:27.680
But not like that.

49:58.030 --> 50:02.030
You stay here, Madison. What's going on?

50:04.060 --> 50:08.100
Why now? We have to warn them.

50:08.100 --> 50:12.110
What if something happens? Just
keep her safe. We made a deal.

50:12.110 --> 50:16.140
That's all we can tell, okay.
We will be in contact with you.

50:16.140 --> 50:20.220
How long will you be gone. You be good

50:20.220 --> 50:24.240
and you listen to Doc. I love you.

50:24.240 --> 50:28.290
You keep this. Hold it for me.

50:28.290 --> 50:32.360
Until I get back.

50:36.390 --> 50:38.430
Thank you.

51:08.800 --> 51:12.840
Hey, I'm wake. You don't have to be
quiet on my account. How did you sleep?

51:12.840 --> 51:16.890
It was one of my better nights. Good.

51:16.890 --> 51:20.910
You hungry? Oh, yeah.

51:24.950 --> 51:28.990
There we go.

51:28.990 --> 51:33.060
Alright. Wow.

51:37.100 --> 51:41.150
Coffee? Yes, please.

51:41.150 --> 51:45.170
Thanks. You bet.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.320
These are really good.
And I don't like eggs.

51:58.320 --> 52:01.330
I'm sorry. Katie doesn't like them either.

52:01.330 --> 52:05.400
But she'll eat them like this.
No really, they're good.

52:05.400 --> 52:09.430
How do you get Katie to like them.
Secret? Lots of cheese.

52:09.430 --> 52:13.480
Yeah, secret.

52:13.480 --> 52:17.540
Well, it ain't really a secret. It's...

52:19.540 --> 52:21.560
Madison?

52:21.560 --> 52:25.620
They were hiding a secret.
Who? What secret?

52:25.620 --> 52:29.690
My parents. We need to find
the secret they found.

52:29.690 --> 52:31.683
If we can figure out the
secret, we can figure

52:31.695 --> 52:33.700
out why the people have
been disappearing.

52:33.700 --> 52:37.720
Okay, how?

52:37.720 --> 52:41.790
Well, I have a list of the former
residents whose homes were destroyed.

52:45.820 --> 52:47.840
And

52:52.860 --> 52:56.890
who would have lived here when my
parents went missing 15 years ago.

52:56.890 --> 52:58.930
I have their forwarding addresses.

52:58.930 --> 53:00.960
And a few live nearby.

53:28.140 --> 53:30.190
You're her first visitor.

53:30.190 --> 53:34.230
I hate to say it, but she's
not really coherent.

53:34.230 --> 53:38.250
She doesn't recognize anyone
or remember anything.

53:38.250 --> 53:42.280
I'm not sure she's going to be of any
help, but here she is. Thank you.

53:46.320 --> 53:50.390
Hello. Ms. Dottie?

53:52.390 --> 53:54.430
My name is Madison.

53:54.430 --> 53:57.450
I'm an engineer with the US Army Corps.

53:57.450 --> 54:00.510
They took my house away from me.

54:00.510 --> 54:03.510
Yes. The hurricane.

54:03.510 --> 54:08.590
They took it. They took
them all away from us.

54:08.590 --> 54:10.610
All?

54:14.630 --> 54:18.680
You be careful, they're watching.

54:22.710 --> 54:26.750
Take me outside for some air.

54:26.750 --> 54:30.770
And grab that umbrella over there.

54:32.800 --> 54:35.840
Come on, let's go.

54:39.840 --> 54:42.920
The heat is too harsh on my skin.

54:42.920 --> 54:45.960
I didn't want to talk to you in there.

54:45.960 --> 54:48.960
I know, you think I'm crazy too.

54:48.960 --> 54:53.020
But do you know what's crazier,
me staying in that ward

54:53.020 --> 54:57.050
So you want to be here? I can stay here,

54:57.050 --> 55:01.080
I'm fed three times a day,
a warm bed to sleep in,

55:01.080 --> 55:05.130
and no one hunting me.
I'm off the map here.

55:05.130 --> 55:09.210
Off the map? Yeah.

55:09.210 --> 55:13.250
Listen, I'm sorry I thought
you could help me.

55:13.250 --> 55:17.300
You've lived in that ward for over
20 years. And I just thought --

55:17.300 --> 55:21.380
you know, my parents were -- They
didn't want us in that ward.

55:21.380 --> 55:25.410
If you didn't leave on your
own, you were left on you own.

55:25.410 --> 55:28.450
So you think you were forced to leave?

55:28.450 --> 55:31.460
Why else hasn't that ward been rebuilt?

55:31.460 --> 55:34.510
They didn't want us there from the get go.
So someone...

55:34.510 --> 55:37.510
Something, forced us out.

55:37.510 --> 55:41.550
Could be an act of God. Or just an act.

55:41.550 --> 55:44.570
They offered us money to leave the ward.

55:44.570 --> 55:48.610
Some who didn't take the money,
our homes were destroyed.

55:48.610 --> 55:51.640
And when that didn't keep us out,

55:51.640 --> 55:54.650
some disappeared. Those spared

55:57.650 --> 56:01.680
owe their lives.

56:01.680 --> 56:05.770
Who do you owe your life to?

56:08.800 --> 56:11.830
Do these people look familiar to you?

56:11.830 --> 56:14.900
They were warned.

56:14.900 --> 56:18.910
What do you mean, "they were warned"?
The watchers.

56:18.910 --> 56:21.910
I hope I haven't said too much.
They know you.

56:21.910 --> 56:24.950
Watchers? Who are watching?

56:24.950 --> 56:28.030
Oh, you don't want to go too
deep down that rabbit hole.

56:28.030 --> 56:32.070
You might not like what you find.

56:32.070 --> 56:35.110
The power these people have. Power, I mean,

56:35.110 --> 56:38.170
who has has that much power?
Do you believe -- Belief?

56:38.170 --> 56:40.678
Doesn't matter if I
believe it or not, if

56:40.690 --> 56:43.210
it's true. Listen, I
read that you have a son

56:43.210 --> 56:45.728
that he lives with you.
Do you think that I might

56:45.740 --> 56:48.270
be able to talk with him?
Does he know what

56:48.270 --> 56:52.340
you're talking about. They got him too.

56:52.340 --> 56:54.390
I'm going go ahead and go right now.

56:54.390 --> 56:58.390
My dinner's getting cold.
You go see the man

56:58.390 --> 57:02.440
at the house.

57:02.440 --> 57:06.460
You'll know it when you see it.

57:06.460 --> 57:10.480
And, uh, you can go ahead and keep that
umbrella. Because it's going to rain.

57:24.660 --> 57:26.680
The sediment in your

57:26.680 --> 57:30.680
samples didn't come from the flood water.

57:30.680 --> 57:34.720
But where did it come from? That's
actually fresh water bacteria.

57:34.720 --> 57:38.740
Not found in salt water. People
are dumping tires, mattresses

57:38.740 --> 57:41.750
and trash. I mean, who would
bring in fresh water?

57:41.750 --> 57:44.253
I also found that the soil
in one of your samples

57:44.265 --> 57:46.780
contained a high concentration
of silver nitrate.

57:46.780 --> 57:50.860
Who's putting silver in the soil?

57:50.860 --> 57:54.880
It could have been dredged up from
the broken levee. A lot of stuff

57:54.880 --> 57:58.930
settled in the soil once they drained the
water. The water from levee brought in an

57:58.930 --> 58:02.950
infestation of mosquitoes with the
West Nile virus. Among other diseases

58:02.950 --> 58:06.970
that settled in the soil
with the stagnate water.

58:06.970 --> 58:11.020
But if a garden has a high level of silver
nitrate... It would be contaminated.

58:11.020 --> 58:15.070
And anything that was ingested
you would see it on their skin.

58:15.070 --> 58:19.090
Blue skin. Argyria.

58:19.090 --> 58:23.140
The reaction of ingesting
silver, it turns the skin blue.

58:27.200 --> 58:31.240
City plans from the 1900s.

58:31.240 --> 58:35.260
Power grid.

58:37.320 --> 58:41.320
Library closes in five minutes.
Okay. Thank you, ma'am.

59:02.540 --> 59:04.590
Property deeds?

59:05.540 --> 59:09.590
That doesn't make sense.

59:14.630 --> 59:17.660
Hey Madison. You find anything?

59:17.660 --> 59:21.710
Yeah, but I'm not sure what it means.
The Legaux house isn't on any grid.

59:21.710 --> 59:24.730
No water or power running
to or from the house.

59:24.730 --> 59:27.730
But she had electricity.
Did she have a generator?

59:27.730 --> 59:31.760
I didn't see or hear one.

59:31.760 --> 59:36.810
Any luck on your end. Yeah, bits and
pieces, but not a clear picture.

59:36.810 --> 59:41.840
I'll meet you back at your place.
I have to make a stop first.

59:41.840 --> 59:43.890
Okay. I'll see you then.

59:51.930 --> 59:55.980
That wasn't five minutes. Hey.

59:55.980 --> 59:57.980
Hey, I'm still here.

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:04.070
Ma'am?

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.120
Hello! Hello?

01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:22.310
Anybody! Hello!

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:40.410
Hello?!

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:54.540
Hello! Hello?!

01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:05.620
Hello?!

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.040
Merci.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.040
Can I help you? Yes, maybe you can.

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:45.090
We got candles, incense, crystals.

01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:49.120
What is this?

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.140
I don't know. You tell me. It's a triangle
with a circle inside. Is it voodoo?

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:57.160
You think all black people practice voodoo?
Get out of here.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.200
I'm sorry.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:03.220
Where did you see it?

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.250
In the 9th Ward

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:09.250
on the houses marked for teardown.
How many of them were there?

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:13.270
I think there were about seven. Do
you have any idea what it means?

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:21.330
The three sides of the triangle
might possibly mean trinity.

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:25.360
Like in Christianity? Yeah. But
trinity may means different

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.410
things for different people.
Like mother, father, child.

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:33.450
Creation, preservation, destruction.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:37.470
And it is not a circle in the triangle.
It is an eye.

01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:41.490
It means cleansing. A sign of protection.
You see those two elements?

01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:43.498
There's a female element
and a male element.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:45.530
And together they
are very powerful.

01:02:45.530 --> 01:02:48.560
Protection from what?

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.590
That's not the symbol I'd be worried about.
If I were you,

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:56.610
I'd worry about this mark on the house.

01:02:56.610 --> 01:03:00.650
But that's contractor shorthand. It
looks like the symbol from voodoo

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:04.680
queen of New Orleans. What does it mean?
The story is that

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.780
Marie Laveau, voodoo
queen, will grant you help

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:11.830
if you mark it with an x.

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:14.850
But you must mark it on a tombstone.

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:31.980
I don't want any of that stuff in here.
No black magic here.

01:03:33.010 --> 01:03:35.050
Leave.

01:03:35.050 --> 01:03:39.110
Grant protection from what?
There's voodoo in that ward.

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:46.130
What is all this?

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:48.170
Voodoo shit? I don't know, it's something.

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:52.170
Something that people are disappearing
because of. And it's real.

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:56.240
Why are we doing this then? This is crazy.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.300
Don't you want to know what's going on?
No. I just want to do the job,

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.288
get paid and keep it going. If
we don't find out what's going

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:06.300
on, we're not going to get
anywhere with this project.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.793
I mean, I think there is
more information in the

01:04:07.805 --> 01:04:09.310
files at the corps office.
The hell with the files.

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:10.323
You're doing this for
more than the project. I

01:04:10.335 --> 01:04:11.360
have to find out what
happened to my parents.

01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.360
If there is any connection
-- To whose end? Your own?

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.420
I thought you were with me in this.

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.450
Shit, I was. But it ain't
worth getting killed over.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:23.450
Missing parents or not. It does you
no good when you end up like them.

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.530
Don't go.

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:31.530
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.640
Don't work too late.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.640
No one notices and they
don't appreciate it.

01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:46.690
Have a good night. Goodnight.

01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:50.750
Hey, Eugenia is there any reason
why my access would be restricted.

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:54.800
Umm, no. No, I don't know. But O'Reilly
is still here maybe you can catch him.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.840
Okay, thanks.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.900
O'Reilly. What do you want?

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.940
I was trying to access some
information and I couldn't get in.

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:12.000
What are you looking for? Some information
about the 9th Ward. Is that a problem?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.040
No problem. Some people start asking
too many questions bad things happen.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.080
I'm sorry, is that a threat?

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.120
It's an observation. Don't let
the residents manipulate you.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.120
You're here for one reason. If you don't
think it's rebuildable then deem it,

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.990
stamp it, and go back home.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:35.030
Or stay.

01:06:37.690 --> 01:06:39.690
Lew?

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.810
No, it's me.

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:51.870
Madison, I know you're upset with me.
What are you doing here?

01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:55.890
I know you think I let
you down, but I didn't.

01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:59.960
I know you were just trying to make
sense of your parents' work. Sorry.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.180
Kitch!

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.340
So connecting the coordinates
creates one big triangle.

01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:37.400
Over the 9th Ward.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:41.420
A ward within a ward. Sophie
Legaux's house in the center of it.

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:44.450
Yes, my parents' work.

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:48.510
Maybe they knew the levees had been
undermined. Set up to be destroyed.

01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:52.530
Beyond the lack of maintenance. The city
knew the levee needed reinforcement?

01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:56.560
Worse, no one did anything.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:00.610
That's some pretty serious
shit you're suspecting.

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:04.630
Someone intentionally destroyed the ward?

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:08.710
Well, maybe someone knew there was
a pattern and they intentionally

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:12.760
manipulated that pattern
for their own purposes.

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.770
Don't have to rebuild the levee,

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:18.778
know a storm is going to
hit, cause catastrophic

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:20.810
repercussions. Forcing
people to leave their homes.

01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:22.823
That's where the property
deed comes in. Yeah,

01:08:22.835 --> 01:08:24.859
and that's what my
parents' research showed.

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:28.880
They knew something was
happening in this ward.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:32.930
It still doesn't explain the disappearance
or the other that have gone missing since.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:37.020
Yeah. It's a place to start.

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:41.050
If that's true, we need to report this.
To whom?

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.053
To the police. Or someone
who will listen. This is

01:08:43.064 --> 01:08:45.080
beyond us. Beyond, beyond
the scope of what I do.

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.113
Listen, let's just meet at
the office tomorrow and go

01:08:47.125 --> 01:08:49.170
through more of the files,
we need more information.

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:57.270
Okay. Alright.

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:09.390
You sure you're going to be okay here?
Yeah, I'll just, uh,

01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:13.399
turn the light down dim.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:17.420
Well,

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.439
call me if you need anything. Thanks.

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:35.560
Yeah, I'm on my way, I just
need to make a stop first.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:41.600
Sit tight. Take care of yourself.
And what is that supposed to mean?

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.630
Will I end up like others have?

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:49.660
Ms. Sophie. Now you're not
getting soft on me, are you?

01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:53.680
Anyway, no one was supposed to get hurt.
And yet many have.

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.790
Madison.

01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:11.930
What brings you here, Mayor? It's my city.

01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:13.020
I have to take care of it.

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:18.020
Why don't you come by the
office later and we can talk.

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:20.070
And you can give me an update.

01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:26.090
See you later.

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.150
He comes here now and then to check on us.

01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:34.180
I laugh. He doesn't give a damn really.
Why does he come here?

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:38.210
Well, he thinks I have some
kind of influence, power.

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:42.280
Do you? Marie Laveau?

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.300
My name's Legaux.

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.330
Do you think I'm the voodoo queen
and I made the storm happen?

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:54.390
I don't know what to think anymore.
You seemed troubled, child.

01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:00.450
I shouldn't have come here.

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:03.450
Why did you come?

01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:06.510
Thought I could get some answers. Change.

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:10.570
That's what they mean. What?

01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:12.620
The symbols on the houses.

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.620
What kind of change. Changing of the times.

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:18.640
Nothing will be the same.
Or it will be as it was.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.670
Okay.

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:26.730
I don't know what to tell you.

01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:30.790
You know I need this. Yeah, I'm sorry.
I did everything I can.

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:34.810
I’m going to have to let you go.
There’s nothing I can do.

01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:38.850
There's nothing you can do? No.

01:11:38.850 --> 01:11:42.930
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing. Kitch.

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:46.960
What's going on? I just lost my
at getting my daughter back.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.963
I got pulled off. Someone
else got the contract.

01:11:48.975 --> 01:11:50.990
They can't do that.
Well, they just did.

01:11:50.990 --> 01:11:53.010
Madison, can I see you?

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:59.030
Hey, you did this.

01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:03.080
Be careful. Kitch.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:10.140
Why did you fire Kitch?

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.200
I want progress. As of now, I'm not
getting it. Do you have an update?

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:18.250
We were getting a better understanding.
Can you rebuild or not? It's that simple.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:21.280
Well, I found some anomalies. Anomalies?

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:23.793
Is that really your job? I
figured you'd come here, tell

01:12:23.805 --> 01:12:26.330
me there isn't a way to
rebuild and be on your way.

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:29.380
If that's a problem, you
need to tell Washington.

01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:33.420
You can tell them on your flight back home.
You're not needed here anymore.

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.490
Eugenia will see you out.

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:42.640
I will see myself out.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:59.820
You've reached the voicemail of Kitch
Jones. Kitch, please don't be mad.

01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:03.890
I promise I'll get your job back.
Call me when you get this.

01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:15.030
So where we at? Looks like it won't happen.

01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:19.060
Foundation is too unstable. What about
Madison? I thought she was the one.

01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:23.110
There's too much going on
to rebuild at this time.

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:25.133
We still got squatters. Those
have been taken care of.

01:13:25.145 --> 01:13:27.180
And there are residents who
are expecting to come back?

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:32.220
Most have relocated and not even thinking
about coming back any time soon.

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:35.280
There's on person in
particular we're waiting on.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.300
Well, what are we going to do with her?

01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:40.300
Persuade her a little harder to leave.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:44.350
And if she doesn't? Well,
she's an older woman.

01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:48.380
It'd be a tragedy if something happened
to her while she was all alone

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:52.440
in that big house.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:54.490
Well, I can't condone that, can I?

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:57.490
She’ll be out and you don’t
have to know about it.

01:13:57.490 --> 01:14:01.580
Listen, we just want safety.

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:04.600
You’ll get safety. Don't worry.

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:32.840
Don't go. Don't go.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.840
Move! Out of the way.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.980
Kitch, please don't be mad. I
promise I'll get your job back.

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:57.010
Call me when you get this.

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:16.660
Madison! Madison!

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:26.740
Hey. She's not here.

01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:29.760
Dammit!

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.780
But I think I'm on to something about
what's going on in the ward. Oh yeah?

01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:38.810
What's that? That something more
than a natural disaster happened.

01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:41.820
Someone is trying to manipulate the
situation trying to convince people

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:46.850
that the land is not rebuildable. Pumping
bacteria, contaminating the soil.

01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:50.900
So you think something else is at play?

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:54.970
And who do you think is responsible?
O'Reilly? Well, that's a start, I mean.

01:15:54.970 --> 01:15:58.990
Why have my predecessors
left or gone missing?

01:15:58.990 --> 01:16:00.010
What would he benefit?

01:16:00.010 --> 01:16:03.010
I'm not sure.

01:16:03.010 --> 01:16:07.030
But why would be pull Kitch
and me off the project?

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:11.060
And why hasn't this ward been rebuilt?

01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:15.120
If the land is deemed condemned
and the owners can't rebuild then

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.190
somebody would just buy
that land dirt cheap.

01:16:19.190 --> 01:16:23.210
And make a fortune in development.

01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:31.230
There's a few reasons why the
ward hadn't been rebuilt.

01:16:31.230 --> 01:16:35.260
See, things don't happen over night
down here. It takes years sometimes.

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.280
Patience. Funding.

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.340
And residents not willing to leave.

01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:47.370
You know, I may have some
information that may help you.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.390
Great.

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:51.390
But I want to hear more of your theory.

01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:53.460
You think you could write
something up for me?

01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:56.510
I believe you. I think you may be right.

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:58.510
Thank you for looking into this.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.520
Let me walk you out.

01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:18.670
You know what, I may have that information
that you need right around here somewhere.

01:17:18.670 --> 01:17:21.690
Give me a second, I'll get it for you.

01:17:21.690 --> 01:17:23.740
Um, actually, Kitch is waiting
for me downstairs in his truck.

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:26.790
So, thank you.

01:17:26.790 --> 01:17:31.810
You sure, it'll only take a minute?
Oh yes, and I'll get that

01:17:31.810 --> 01:17:35.870
report in to you in the morning. And
I'll be on my way back to San Francisco.

01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:49.390
We're renovating this side of the building.

01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:52.420
It was hit bad by the storm.

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:55.480
A lot of water damage.

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:25.850
Accidents happen in construction sites.

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:37.980
Wood rot.

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:10.320
Listen, I'm sorry it had to end like this.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.330
Why couldn't you just leave like
all the rest of the engineers.

01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:17.340
You had to be the one with the solution.

01:21:17.340 --> 01:21:21.390
Mess up everything, everything
I've been trying to do for years.

01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:24.410
What about the people in the ward?

01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:28.450
That ward is no longer for the poor.

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:30.450
You know how much money I
stand to make on that land?

01:21:30.450 --> 01:21:34.470
All you had to do was
say it was unbuildable.

01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:38.510
Because the parcels of the land are
still in the hand of the land owners.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.640
Come here! Help!

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.660
Help!!!

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:54.710
Help!

01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:06.840
Oh my god! Help!

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.920
Help!

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:14.940
Ohh! Help!

01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:19.010
She sent me to protect you.

01:22:34.130 --> 01:22:37.150
Thank you. You okay?

01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:39.150
Yeah.

01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:43.190
It's over. We got proof now.

01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:03.450
Madison! Madison!

01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.450
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:07.450
Madison is not here. She's fine.

01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:10.480
She had to make a stop before she left.

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:12.520
Who the hell are you?

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.520
Kitch Jones.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.540
We work together.

01:23:23.570 --> 01:23:26.600
Just keeps getting weirder around here.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.600
Ms. Legaux. You came back.

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.690
You get your answers?

01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:34.250
Yes. Your neighbors will be moving back.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:36.250
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:39.250
I already got what I wanted.

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:43.330
And the ward will be rebuilt.
To the way it was?

01:23:43.330 --> 01:23:47.390
With improvements. By the way, the
soil in your garden is contaminated.

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:51.400
I know. So what happened?

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.480
The mayor had no intentions

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:59.490
of rebuilding for the current
residents, but had aspirations

01:23:59.490 --> 01:24:01.530
to gentrify the ward.

01:24:01.530 --> 01:24:03.540
And how was he able to do that?

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.560
Move everyone out.

01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.600
Or get rid of them.

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.660
Yes, then he could do as he pleased.

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:11.690
Come in, won't you. Yes.

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:23.690
How is it that you have power?

01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:27.750
There's more than one kind
of power in this world.

01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:31.840
Batteries.

01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.950
Ah, right.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.050
Tea?

01:24:38.050 --> 01:24:40.050
Sure.

01:24:48.150 --> 01:24:52.200
Do you think you'll like it here? Nawlins?

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.220
I think it might take a
little getting used to.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:57.220
But I think Doc is off to a good start.

01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:00.250
I don't believe you still watch this stuff.

01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:02.330
You think that's funny?

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:06.350
Hahaha. Look. Kicked in the crouch.

01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:08.390

Any leads on your parents?

01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:12.390
No. But...

01:25:12.390 --> 01:25:16.440
Doc said he'll help me find them.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.470
I didn't know but he's been

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:20.500
Wow.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:24.520
Madison!

01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.520
Katie! Hey, sweetheart.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.550
