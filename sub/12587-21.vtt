<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:32.198 --> 00:36.204
Gentlemen, today I achieved
a significant milestone.

00:36.203 --> 00:39.207
I killed my ten-thousandth rat.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.424
Mrs. Dunphy's Weimaraner
gets co-credit,

00:41.415 --> 00:43.509
but I got my mallet in there.

00:43.502 --> 00:44.673
Wow, man, Wow.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.216
Like a dang ol'
exclusive club, man.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.930
Well, congratulations, Dale.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.515
That's exciting news.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.555
Look who's telling
me about exciting.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.725
The man who stood
behind Waylon Jennings

00:53.719 --> 00:55.142
on an escalator!

00:55.137 --> 00:57.140
Well, I was five people back.

00:57.307 --> 00:58.182
Hey Gribble,

00:58.350 --> 00:59.646
the trophy shop said

00:59.643 --> 01:01.235
this was the biggest plaque
they had.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.606
Thank you, Octavio.

01:03.604 --> 01:06.198
Eh, he was supposed
to be mid-roar.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.323
Uh, so, Bill,

01:09.319 --> 01:10.695
what have you been up to?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.781
I, uh...

01:13.781 --> 01:16.786
I gave my ten-thousandth
Army haircut.

01:16.784 --> 01:18.206
Mm-hmm.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.500
And I'm getting a plaque.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.382
Wait a second.

01:22.373 --> 01:26.174
I feel like I saw that
in a movie or something.

01:26.168 --> 01:28.216
You disguised certain
facts, <i>esse</i>,

01:28.212 --> 01:30.716
but that story is Gribble's
intellectual property.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.468
Bill, tell us something
that's happened to you.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.516
Well... recently
I stole Dale's story

01:36.513 --> 01:38.515
and tried to pass it off
as mine.

01:40.308 --> 01:44.234
I'm a boring man
and I have no life.

01:45.646 --> 01:48.695
So, Boomhauer,
what's new with you?

01:48.692 --> 01:50.159
<i>Did you guys hear what happened</i>

01:50.319 --> 01:51.161
last night?

01:51.319 --> 01:53.197
Someone broke into the art room

01:53.195 --> 01:55.198
and ate all the macaroni
projects.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.040
I heard some janitors talking

01:57.033 --> 01:59.206
about weird stuff
going on here at night.

01:59.201 --> 02:01.704
Showers turning on
by themselves.

02:01.704 --> 02:04.003
Mysterious toilet cloggings.

02:03.998 --> 02:07.003
Sounds like Prom Queen Mary
is back.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.628
Who's Prom Queen Mary?

02:09.628 --> 02:13.224
The ghost of a former
Tom Landry prom queen.

02:13.216 --> 02:17.015
She was decapitated when
a basketball hoop collapsed

02:17.012 --> 02:19.230
under the weight
of too much crepe paper.

02:19.222 --> 02:22.225
Every prom season,
she comes back.

02:22.224 --> 02:24.818
She still wants to dance.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.812
The headless prom queen is back!

02:26.812 --> 02:28.235
What else could it be?

02:28.230 --> 02:29.231
Move along, kids.

02:29.231 --> 02:30.528
You want to have a conversation,

02:30.525 --> 02:32.072
do it in the back of class.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.866
Principal Moss,

02:33.861 --> 02:35.283
have you heard anything

02:35.280 --> 02:37.578
about Tom Landry being haunted

02:37.574 --> 02:39.793
by a headless prom queen?

02:39.784 --> 02:43.085
No, we had a couple kids choke
on erasers, but no hauntings.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.002
I'd probably remember
something like that.

02:46.957 --> 02:48.925
Joseph, tomorrow night

02:48.918 --> 02:52.173
we are getting video proof
of Prom Queen Mary!

02:54.216 --> 02:56.218
<i>Before Debbie gets here,</i>

02:56.218 --> 02:59.187
I didn't exactly tell her
you were my roommate.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.227
I said you were my gay butler.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.224
Oh, no, you didn't!

03:04.225 --> 03:05.978
Here comes trouble!

03:05.977 --> 03:07.569
Dude,
she's not gonna buy it.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.235
When I slept with
Debbie last night,

03:09.230 --> 03:11.233
I told her I was
a race car driver.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.235
Oh, no, you didn't!

03:15.069 --> 03:16.413
Those roommates!

03:16.405 --> 03:18.372
Aren't they funny?

03:21.075 --> 03:23.670
That's it!

03:23.662 --> 03:25.663
I was watching TV last night,

03:25.663 --> 03:28.133
and I figured out what was
missing from my life.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.218
Everything, except a TV?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.757
A roommate!

03:31.752 --> 03:33.221
It will transform my life

03:33.212 --> 03:35.932
from gritty drama
to bright new comedy!

03:35.924 --> 03:37.766
Hey, hey, whoa, man.
That's madness.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.510
Now, hold on there, Bill.

03:39.510 --> 03:43.231
Why don't you start small and
work your way up to a roommate?

03:43.223 --> 03:46.227
What about that fighting fish
you've had your eye on?

03:46.225 --> 03:48.194
Nope, roommate!

03:54.234 --> 03:56.235
Bill, guys your age
don't get roommates

03:56.235 --> 03:57.908
unless they're in prison.

03:57.903 --> 03:58.950
And that only works

03:58.947 --> 04:01.040
because they have
something in common.

04:01.032 --> 04:05.127
No, Hank, having a roommate will
be instant fun all the time.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.919
Roommates go on double dates,
they swap clothes.

04:08.914 --> 04:10.040
When the phone rings,

04:10.040 --> 04:11.668
and it's a person
you're avoiding,

04:11.668 --> 04:14.045
you can whisper, "I don't want
to talk to him,"

04:14.044 --> 04:16.548
and your roommate will say,
"He's right here."

04:16.548 --> 04:18.221
That's hilarious!

04:18.216 --> 04:20.218
Bill, you and your
roommate crack me up.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.185
What can possibly happen next?

04:22.345 --> 04:24.221
Everyone, slow down.

04:24.221 --> 04:26.940
Bill, if you weren't you
and you met you,

04:26.932 --> 04:28.685
would you want to live with you?

04:28.685 --> 04:31.483
Well, maybe not,
but someone will.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.231
I placed this ad online.

04:33.230 --> 04:37.235
"Roommate urgently wanted
for fun, good times,

04:37.235 --> 04:39.612
"and getting in and out of jams.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.456
"I'm up for anything.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.495
Anything."

04:42.490 --> 04:44.209
Think I'll get any responses?

04:44.201 --> 04:46.202
Unfortunately, yes.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.625
Bill, whoever you get
affects us, too.

04:50.122 --> 04:53.423
I'm sorry, but we're taking over
your roommate search.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.136
I still get final decision,
right?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.137
Yes.

04:56.295 --> 04:58.718
But we reserve ultimate
decision.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.682
Fair enough.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.682
As an artist,

05:03.677 --> 05:06.055
I'm not able to pay rent.

05:06.055 --> 05:08.228
But I will fill
your home with art.

05:08.225 --> 05:11.399
Over there,
I see a rusty bathtub

05:11.394 --> 05:14.237
filled with bicycle parts
and urine.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.824
Sounds beautiful.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.692
Here's two keys...
No.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.240
I-I-I don't want the small room.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.238
I want the big room-- your room.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.956
Okay. When can you...

05:23.949 --> 05:25.747
And I changed my mind.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.165
I want both rooms--
All the rooms!

05:28.161 --> 05:30.163
And a sign in front that says
"Jimmy's House."

05:30.329 --> 05:32.002
I don't hear a deal-breaker.

05:31.997 --> 05:33.375
Bill.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.218
So I'm Kadee Calhoun.

05:35.209 --> 05:38.134
I recently got divorced,
so I'm looking for a new place.

05:38.295 --> 05:40.139
I hostess at Luly's and...

05:40.130 --> 05:42.132
Are you the
same Kadee Calhoun

05:42.300 --> 05:44.223
who was Miss March, 1978?

05:44.218 --> 05:45.937
Why, yes I am.

05:47.012 --> 05:48.230
Oh, God...

05:48.223 --> 05:51.101
Kurt Vonnegut Jr.
And mopeds.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.226
war.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.228
Do you still miniature golf
in the nude

05:54.228 --> 05:55.776
or was that just
for the picture?

05:55.771 --> 05:57.990
Wow... you really remember.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.406
I have a memory for things
I look at all the time.

06:00.401 --> 06:03.245
Well, those pictures
were taken a lifetime ago.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.615
Now, I'm just focused
on my career,

06:05.615 --> 06:08.209
staying positive,
and finding a place to live.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.124
I hope I'm what
you're looking for.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.497
Well, Kadee Calhoun,
I am quite confident

06:12.497 --> 06:14.214
that you've...
Got to keep looking.

06:14.206 --> 06:15.333
Good luck with that.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.961
Bill, you'd just get

06:17.961 --> 06:20.213
emotionally involved
with someone like her.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.930
No, no, no!
No, I wouldn't.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.470
Look at her!
She needs me.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.218
We're here to find
a middle-aged guy

06:26.218 --> 06:27.687
with a job, that's it.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.726
Sorry for wasting your time,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.975
Miss, uh... March.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.192
Remember, it's Luanne's
wedding video in here,

06:41.192 --> 06:44.446
so we don't want to tape over it
unless we are positive

06:44.446 --> 06:46.413
it's a ghost.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.827
What's that rattling?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.201
Is it the spirit board?

06:49.199 --> 06:51.201
Maybe she's trying
to tell us something.

06:51.201 --> 06:53.125
No, I couldn't find
the spirit board,

06:53.288 --> 06:54.915
so I brought Word Scramble.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.793
Maybe she's trying to tell us
something in spelling.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.216
;
Joseph!

07:02.213 --> 07:05.182
Those are not human words!

07:06.216 --> 07:07.843
She's in
the science lab!

07:07.843 --> 07:10.221
She's trying to
reanimate herself!

07:11.848 --> 07:13.225
Run!

07:18.939 --> 07:20.737
Here's a good way to save money.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.951
Instead of throwing away
calendars, save them

07:23.944 --> 07:26.947
and use them again
in seven to 14 years.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.415
Huh.

07:29.406 --> 07:31.158
Hello?

07:31.158 --> 07:33.206
Dad, you have to come get us.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.079
Bobby? Where are you?

07:35.079 --> 07:37.457
We're in the girls'
bathroom at school.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.504
It's actually not that
different.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.050
And there is some
creepy stuff going on.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.422
I'll be right there.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.673
Don't touch anything.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.560
I can't believe

07:48.550 --> 07:50.144
you kids broke into the school

07:50.302 --> 07:52.180
over this nonsense.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.773
Bobby, you're grounded.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.608
Joseph, I'm sure your dad

07:55.600 --> 07:57.523
will have his own
punishment for you.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.192
Oh, I will.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.110
For starters, mister,
you will be my shield

08:02.107 --> 08:04.235
when we encounter the
headless prom queen.

08:04.233 --> 08:07.158
Dale, there is no prom queen.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.206
I didn't hear the bell.

08:15.202 --> 08:17.000
Is it first period already?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.216
When my wife and I split up,

08:21.209 --> 08:24.213
she got the money and the house,
and I was living in the car.

08:24.211 --> 08:25.805
Then she got the car, too,

08:25.797 --> 08:27.173
so this is the logical choice.

08:27.339 --> 08:30.468
I can't believe
Principal Moss is living

08:30.468 --> 08:32.470
at Tom Landry Middle School.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.187
I know, with a ghost!

08:34.179 --> 08:36.227
You fellas have time to stay
for a health film?

08:36.224 --> 08:37.600
I know the good ones.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.570
Carl, you can't keep
sleeping at the school.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.235
I know that, Hank.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.981
But I had a hell of a run.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.779
Wait a sec.

08:45.774 --> 08:48.778
The solution to everyone's
problem is right here.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.201
No, it's not.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.870
Bill, meet your new roommate.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.210
You got Skinemax?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.202
Yes.

08:57.202 --> 08:58.750
Let's do it.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.506
I'll just get the crate
of little milks,

09:08.505 --> 09:10.052
and that's all my stuff.

09:11.967 --> 09:13.220
Please, Hank.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.937
I want adventure and
fun-loving good times.

09:15.929 --> 09:17.977
Carl smells like sloppy joes.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.601
Carl is the perfect
roommate for you.

09:20.601 --> 09:22.524
One, he'll be able to pay rent.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.822
Were you gonna give me a "two"?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.613
Dang it,
you don't need a "two."

09:27.609 --> 09:28.985
Do need a two.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.986
Sure gonna be different
sleeping in a place

09:30.986 --> 09:32.989
where bells don't go off
every 50 minutes.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.209
Well, I know you guys are
eager to make a chore wheel,

09:36.201 --> 09:38.249
so I'm gonna get
out of your way.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.211
Well, let's make
the best of this.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.709
What do you want to do first?

09:43.707 --> 09:44.924
Buy a foosball table?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.043
Crash a wedding?

09:46.043 --> 09:47.886
I should pick up some deodorant.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.130
I've been using blackboard chalk

09:49.297 --> 09:51.220
under my arms
for the last three months.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.181
Let's go.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.231
Uh, it seems we're after

09:59.224 --> 10:00.942
the same pack of party napkins.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.936
May I offer a compromise?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.234
You and your friend can wipe
your faces with them

10:05.230 --> 10:08.153
at a pizza party
my roommate and I are throwing.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.202
Only if you let
my roommate and me

10:12.195 --> 10:14.243
bring this giant thing
of margarita mix.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.740
You guys got a blender?

10:15.740 --> 10:17.037
Hey, Bill?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.751
Which of these bad boys
fits better, you think?

10:19.744 --> 10:21.120
My 'rhoids are murder.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.174
Excuse us.

10:29.294 --> 10:31.263
They both look nice.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.182
Bobby, with Principal Moss
living nearby,

10:37.177 --> 10:39.020
the most important
homework you could do

10:39.013 --> 10:40.639
is to cozy up to him.

10:40.639 --> 10:41.856
I get it.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.820
You say "suck up,"
I say "how high?"

10:44.811 --> 10:46.187
Exactly.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.904
He is almost done
with his cigarette.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.696
When he finishes, I want
you to go out there and...

10:50.692 --> 10:52.114
Aw, too late.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.407
He started another one.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.528
Damn.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.996
He'll need an ashtray!

10:55.989 --> 10:57.581
Go!

10:57.573 --> 11:00.702
So we call it
the "Bully Awards."

11:00.701 --> 11:02.500
And when the bullies
come onstage

11:02.495 --> 11:05.214
to accept their prize,
we pack them up

11:05.206 --> 11:07.207
and ship them to another school.

11:07.207 --> 11:08.129
Mm-hmm.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.216
What's the story
with Gribble's wife?

11:11.211 --> 11:13.965
Uh, I'll just freshen this up.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.509
<i>Thanks for
having us over, guys.</i>

11:17.509 --> 11:20.229
I love the literacy posters.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.938
Is that your touch, Carl?

11:21.931 --> 11:24.104
They're covering some
holes in the plaster.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.692
Carl had a little
too much to drink

11:25.684 --> 11:27.437
and thought his shadow
was attacking him.

11:28.645 --> 11:31.274
Uh, okay,
jacks or better to open.

11:32.357 --> 11:34.951
Carl, why don't you
put on some shoes?

11:34.943 --> 11:36.240
It's okay to walk
around barefoot

11:36.236 --> 11:38.740
when it's just you and me,
but we have company.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.119
Oh, right, your fancy party that
you've been planning for days.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.210
Well, here it is,

11:43.202 --> 11:45.080
the social event of the season.

11:45.078 --> 11:47.206
Is it everything
you dreamed of, Bill?

11:47.206 --> 11:48.674
We'll talk about it later.

11:48.665 --> 11:49.792
It never stops.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.088
"Carl, put on your shoes.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.631
"Carl, get up so I can vacuum.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.471
Carl, don't fall asleep
on the toilet."

11:54.463 --> 11:56.057
Try living with that.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.551
Um...

11:57.549 --> 12:00.224
we're still looking
for our jacks.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.767
You see how he is?

12:01.763 --> 12:04.231
And another thing,
Carl swore he didn't eat

12:04.224 --> 12:05.897
all my mustard,
but I know he did.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.235
Tonight, after he vomits,
I'll have my proof.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.230
You still yappin'
about that mustard?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.697
Oh, look who's back.

12:11.688 --> 12:13.032
Aw, man, look,

12:13.024 --> 12:14.741
talkin' about
a dang ol' cat fight, man.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.244
Man, I'm getting
out of here, man.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.283
I'm out, too.

12:18.278 --> 12:20.998
I'm Boomhauer's
designated walker.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.206
Yeah, uh...

12:22.200 --> 12:25.124
Yeah, I might not have
set my parking brake.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.713
That one went in my beer!

12:35.712 --> 12:37.556
That's the kind of thing

12:37.548 --> 12:39.390
if you were trying to do it,
you just couldn't.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.226
Oh, I hate you!

12:41.219 --> 12:43.221
I could have had
a Miss March living here

12:43.221 --> 12:44.221
instead of you!

12:44.221 --> 12:45.474
Hank was wrong!

12:45.472 --> 12:47.191
And now I'm gonna
make things right!

12:52.855 --> 12:55.073
Table for one? Bill!

12:55.066 --> 12:57.239
I'm here under false pretenses.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.236
I already had a big lunch,
and I,

12:59.236 --> 13:00.830
I don't need a table for one.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.789
I have a house for two.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.375
Kadee, will you be my roommate?

13:04.366 --> 13:06.836
Yeah, I'm still looking,
so sure.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.422
Oh! You've made
me so happy!

13:09.413 --> 13:12.087
And this happiness
makes me hungry.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.299
Table for one.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.383
That's the last of it.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.130
I'm giving Carl
five more minutes,

13:18.130 --> 13:19.724
and then I'm putting
him on this pile.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.764
All of this could have
been avoided

13:21.759 --> 13:23.760
with an egg timer
in the bathroom.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.229
It got Peggy and me

13:25.221 --> 13:27.222
through the roughest patch
in our marriage.

13:27.222 --> 13:28.190
I feel bad we're throwing

13:28.349 --> 13:29.645
Carl out of the house.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.894
Me, too.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.610
But we'll watch movies

13:32.602 --> 13:34.947
and eat popcorn
and forget all about it.

13:34.938 --> 13:38.067
Bill, you always
make me feel better.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.034
Guess I'll go check
out the closet space.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.200
Bill, this is going to go badly.

13:45.198 --> 13:46.415
Extremely badly.

13:46.408 --> 13:49.037
And when it does,
don't come crying to me.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.130
You should write some
of this down, Hank.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.167
If Kadee and I end up
getting married,

13:54.167 --> 13:57.636
you'll need funny stuff
for your best man speech.

13:57.628 --> 14:01.006
12:05. It's checkout
time at Casa Dauterive.

14:04.092 --> 14:06.221
Carl, I need the room.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.392
Carl?

14:08.472 --> 14:09.850
Bill.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.976
Guess who thinks
I've got cute feet?

14:19.107 --> 14:20.485
It's weird, Bill.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.203
It started as a good-bye hug
and just kept going.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.743
Guess some days it just pays

14:24.739 --> 14:26.206
not to get out of
bed, huh, William?

14:26.198 --> 14:29.123
Mm-hmm, well, Kadee and I
have a lot of roommate stuff

14:29.284 --> 14:31.207
to go over, Carl,
so you're in the way.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.205
Time to leave.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.081
Let's hear what the
lady has to say.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.207
Face it, Bill.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.552
Things would get kind of boring
with just the two of us.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.509
Bill, I'm gonna need my pillow.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.178
I'll go get it.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.898
Hey, Bill.
What's new?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.066
It's like I don't see
you anymore.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.739
We're out of O.J., roomie.

15:14.788 --> 15:16.541
Yeah, things are great.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.634
Kadee and Carl get along
fabulously,

15:18.625 --> 15:19.751
thank goodness.

15:19.751 --> 15:22.096
And Kadee's got so much energy.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.216
She's always dashing out
in the middle of the night

15:24.215 --> 15:25.888
or getting strange phone calls

15:25.883 --> 15:28.226
from a really
impolite Russian guy.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.769
Or warning me not
to touch all these

15:31.764 --> 15:33.892
mysterious boxes she's got.

15:33.890 --> 15:35.393
Life's good.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.778
Well, looks like
you've got company.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.786
This Kadee's house?

15:48.780 --> 15:50.658
I have many boxes for her.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.500
It's my house, actually.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.461
I, I think we've chatted
on the phone.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.671
My name is...

15:55.663 --> 15:57.164
Go away, Yankee Doodle.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.173
We'll call you if we need you.

15:59.332 --> 16:02.177
Okay. Nice night
for a stroll.

16:10.510 --> 16:12.683
Uh, thought I'd come in.

16:12.679 --> 16:14.852
I've got to get up
in four hours.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.946
Bill, we have an interesting
opportunity here.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.240
Kadee and her ex-husband,
Yuri, have lots

16:27.235 --> 16:29.203
of authentic-looking
merchandise

16:29.197 --> 16:31.495
at low, low prices.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.209
They even get all the hit
Hollywood movies

16:33.201 --> 16:34.793
while they're still
in the theaters.

16:34.784 --> 16:36.662
Eye-popping CGI, man.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.376
And because he's the principal,

16:42.375 --> 16:44.470
handsome here said
we could sell our things

16:44.461 --> 16:45.963
at Tom Landry Middle School.

16:45.962 --> 16:47.215
Especially the movies.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.091
That way, kids won't
be downloading them

16:49.091 --> 16:51.092
off the Internet,
which is illegal.

16:53.553 --> 16:55.147
Is fake vodka.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.232
Now I ready to crash.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.899
No! I'm putting my foot down.

16:59.894 --> 17:02.488
Yuri, Carl, I want you both out!

17:02.480 --> 17:04.857
Kadee, I still want
to live with you

17:04.856 --> 17:06.233
but you need a better attitude.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.861
We split difference.

17:07.858 --> 17:09.202
Everybody stay.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.163
Even you.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.704
<i>Attention,
students and faculty.</i>

17:14.700 --> 17:16.701
Today's fire drill is canceled

17:16.701 --> 17:19.125
so you can take advantage
of a fire sale.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.748
So stop by
the principal's office

17:20.748 --> 17:22.464
for some A+ merchandise

17:22.458 --> 17:24.210
at D-minus prices.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.211
That's my neighbor!

17:28.588 --> 17:30.465
Bill won't admit it, but I know

17:30.465 --> 17:31.762
something's going on over there.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.228
Yesterday, that Yuri
tried to sell me

17:34.220 --> 17:36.939
Tim Conway's <i>Dorf On Golf 8.</i>

17:36.931 --> 17:40.560
Everyone knows that's not coming
out for another six months.

17:40.559 --> 17:43.403
Like all Russians, he's just
after your blue jeans.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.193
I'm afraid to put
our laundry on the line.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.528
I'm pooped.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.241
School was exhausting.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.702
But the bargains
were incredible.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.038
Why are you wearing
a girl's purse?

17:53.029 --> 17:56.409
It's a Louis Vuitton backpack
and it's unisex.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.127
Does the Devil
wear Prada?

17:59.119 --> 18:03.215
I don't know,
but the propane salesman does.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.130
And Mom,

18:05.125 --> 18:07.799
I have nothing up my sleeve,
except...

18:07.795 --> 18:09.923
Hermes scarves.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.934
Bobby, where did
all this stuff come from?

18:13.925 --> 18:16.223
Principal Moss had
a special sale.

18:16.220 --> 18:20.144
He even threw in this Cartier
'cause we're neighbors.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.563
All right, that's it.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.105
I'm going over there.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.400
Hank, wear your Prada!

18:27.230 --> 18:29.232
Look who changed mind.

18:29.232 --> 18:30.951
<i>One Dorf on Golf</i> coming up.

18:30.942 --> 18:33.866
I'm not here to buy
an illegal comedy product.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.580
Let me talk to Bill.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.540
Fat man! Visitor!

18:38.200 --> 18:39.122
Hi, Hank.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.537
I'd invite you in,

18:40.536 --> 18:42.788
but we only have
four fondue forks.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.664
Bill, you can drop the act.

18:44.664 --> 18:46.383
I know your roommates
are running

18:46.375 --> 18:48.218
a counterfeit goods operation.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.586
Are they?

18:49.586 --> 18:51.180
Those nutty nuts.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.470
Look, I know I said
when this thing blows up,

18:53.465 --> 18:55.218
don't come crying to me.

18:55.217 --> 18:56.969
Well, you can come cry to me.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.221
The important thing is
that you agree

19:00.221 --> 19:02.441
to stop making decisions
for yourself.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.230
Yes, Hank.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.943
Now, we gotta move fast

19:05.935 --> 19:08.529
before you get even more
got-dang roommates.

19:10.231 --> 19:11.653
I think the problem is,

19:11.651 --> 19:13.243
I don't have enough roommates.

19:13.234 --> 19:14.702
I have an idea.

19:14.694 --> 19:16.571
That sounds like decision talk.

19:16.571 --> 19:17.788
Please, Hank.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.659
Give me one more chance
to fix this myself.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.161
All right.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.923
I supervise a lot of
math teachers, Yuri,

19:26.915 --> 19:29.920
and your dividing by three
skills need a lot of work.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.215
You forgot overhead.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.180
Magic markers, white-out...

19:33.338 --> 19:34.840
So, here's the place.

19:34.839 --> 19:36.092
Oh, hi.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.094
This is Octavio
and his brothers.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.686
They're gonna be
living here, too,

19:39.679 --> 19:40.976
as my guests.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.723
From now on, I park
in the driveway, <i>esse</i>.

19:43.723 --> 19:46.693
Driveway space is mine.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.197
Roommate vote.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.066
Who wants the scary
new guys to leave?

19:53.233 --> 19:55.452
Who wants the scary
new guys to stay?

19:56.237 --> 19:57.739
Tiebreaker!

20:02.535 --> 20:05.663
If the dude filming this takes
one more call on his cell, man,

20:05.663 --> 20:07.006
I'm turning this off!

20:06.997 --> 20:08.589
Who drank my soy milk?

20:08.582 --> 20:10.174
I didn't see no name on it.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.586
I drew a bunny on it.
Same thing!

20:12.586 --> 20:15.839
Hey, we're not taking crap
from an ex-centerfold.

20:15.839 --> 20:17.217
You listen to me.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.684
Once a bunny, always a bunny!

20:19.676 --> 20:22.806
Uh-oh, are my roommates
not getting along?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.603
Maybe a few of you
want to move out.

20:24.597 --> 20:26.851
Casual Encounter?

20:26.851 --> 20:29.444
South of Rainey Street is mine
for perfume, esse.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.439
Is different demographic.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.530
Don't be baby.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.365
Baby? I'll show you baby.

20:35.358 --> 20:37.281
Let's go!

20:50.665 --> 20:52.919
Once the police get
a handle on things,

20:52.917 --> 20:55.511
I think we'll agree that
my plan was a good one.

20:59.090 --> 21:00.843
So I'm thinking of moving out.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.220
Things have gotten
too complicated.

21:02.219 --> 21:03.220
Okay.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.223
Did I get a security
deposit from you?

21:08.933 --> 21:10.230
<i>Hold on.</i>

21:10.227 --> 21:13.446
You gave our rent money
to a phony fortune-teller?

21:13.439 --> 21:14.736
She wasn't phony.

21:14.731 --> 21:16.700
She predicted you'd be mad!

21:55.522 --> 21:58.447
<i>Oh, no, you didn't!</i>

22:01.500 --> 22:09.500
