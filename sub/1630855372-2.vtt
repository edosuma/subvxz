00:02.294 --> 00:05.088
<i>This kid is
a high school basketball phenom.</i>

00:06.423 --> 00:10.928
<i>Depending on who you talk to, top 30,
top 25 in the nation.</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:14.139
<i>But he's about to turn 18 now.</i>

00:15.807 --> 00:17.935
<i>They're gonna look
at him a little differently.</i>

00:18.477 --> 00:20.270
<i>They're no longer gonna ask themselves,</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:24.566
<i>"Does this kid project as someone
who could play on the next level?"</i>

00:24.566 --> 00:26.109
Happy birthday.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.402
<i>They'll be asking,</i>

00:27.903 --> 00:30.572
<i>"Can this grown man play
at the next level?"</i>

01:53.655 --> 01:55.240
Birthday boy!

01:56.200 --> 01:59.661
Hey, sorry I missed your party.

01:59.661 --> 02:03.665
Had a game. We won, but, yeah, sorry.

02:22.226 --> 02:25.729
Don't forget after work I have
a cosmetic party for my consultants.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.067
What time did you go to bed?

02:30.067 --> 02:32.319
- After midnight.
- You need to get more sleep.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.572
Sleep is for kids. I'm a man now.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.950
Not till Friday, baby.
What are you working on?

02:39.076 --> 02:42.204
I have a democracy group project
for Dr. Lawson's class.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.125
I hope it's not due today.

02:47.751 --> 02:48.919
Jace.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.922
Why do you think I was up past midnight?
Cedar Cove is hard, Mom.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.465
Then you better not be late.

02:54.132 --> 02:58.929
I'm about to let everyone
know 18-year-old Jace Carson has arrived.

02:58.929 --> 03:02.391
New season, new coach, new level.

03:02.391 --> 03:03.851
Get your butt to school.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.148
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you too.

03:15.571 --> 03:21.577
<i>I'm every woman
It's all in me</i>

03:24.413 --> 03:26.123
- <i>Every one from A to Z</i>
- Come on, Daddy.

03:26.123 --> 03:29.626
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh-oh</i>

03:29.626 --> 03:32.921
All right. Let's do this.

03:34.798 --> 03:35.632
Okay.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.553
Free tuition, not a bad perk.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.055
Perk is an understatement.

03:42.556 --> 03:46.310
A year's tuition in a place like this
would be two years' salary for me.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.437
- That's crazy.
- Be right back, okay?

03:51.982 --> 03:52.900
Okay. Now remember

03:54.067 --> 03:55.903
when we drop her off
and we say our goodbyes,

03:55.903 --> 03:58.322
- we have to mean it even if she cries.
- Even if she cries.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.824
I know. I know.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.327
I'm more worried about you.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.413
I'm not the reason she's still sleeping
in our bed.

04:06.413 --> 04:10.167
It's not my fault we made a cute-ass baby
that thinks I'm cozy.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.837
It's not part-time day care anymore, okay?

04:13.837 --> 04:17.507
This is eight hours a day,
five days a week.

04:26.892 --> 04:27.893
- Good morning.
- Morning.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.729
Hi.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.153
- Okay.
- Yeah. All right. 'Kay.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.989
- Good morning.
- Okay, Mom and Dad.

04:40.989 --> 04:41.907
Yeah.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.743
All right. Come on, baby. All right.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.704
Mommy and Daddy love you, okay?

04:47.704 --> 04:51.625
We love you so much, Kat Kat,
but we gotta go now, okay? Goodbye.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.835
Okay, bye.

04:58.131 --> 04:58.966
Okay.

05:01.385 --> 05:05.597
So if she gets upset,
you could FaceTime me-- us.

05:05.597 --> 05:09.393
And she loves to sing so-- She loves it.

05:09.393 --> 05:10.978
- Thank you. Let's go.
- Okay.

05:10.978 --> 05:11.937
All right.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.528
Phil! Baby, come on.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.200
This boy.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.078
What's good, Phil?

05:28.078 --> 05:29.663
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, what's good, big man?

05:29.663 --> 05:30.747
We're late.

05:34.209 --> 05:37.212
We're only late
'cause my other shirt is too tight.

05:37.212 --> 05:40.132
Well, maybe you should think
about not growing so damn much.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.677
You know I can't control that.

05:45.429 --> 05:49.850
Listen, remember what Coach Ike said
about today, okay?

05:51.768 --> 05:53.312
Just be yourself.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.397
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:56.815 --> 05:59.026
- Okay, ten and two.
- All right.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.782
The speeches of W.E.B. Du Bois.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.702
The talented tenth.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.120
You're familiar with his teachings?

06:11.872 --> 06:12.915
I'm a little rusty.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.836
He believed the most talented tenth
of our race should be leaders of thought,

06:18.337 --> 06:19.838
missionaries of culture.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.716
- Thank you.
- Of course.

06:25.886 --> 06:29.139
Landing Phil Marksby would be
very impressive to the board,

06:29.139 --> 06:30.474
who, by the way,

06:30.474 --> 06:32.643
are very excited
to meet our interim coach.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.895
They wanna know if you can
win us a national championship.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.189
Doc, you said this interim thing
was a formality.

06:37.189 --> 06:40.567
It is. Just win your first game.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.218
Damn.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.053
Yeah.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.181
<i>What are you interested
in other than basketball?</i>

08:34.972 --> 08:37.726
I've been playing chess since I was 12.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.770
I'm almost at a 1,800 ranking,

08:41.438 --> 08:44.024
but I need to improve my endgame.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.860
Wow, very impressive.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.781
Yeah, I got good playing online.
Not for money or anything.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.533
Just for fun?

08:52.533 --> 08:55.077
Yeah. I mean, yes.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.997
What are your goals for next year?

08:59.581 --> 09:03.544
I'm really interested in
studying criminal justice in college.

09:03.544 --> 09:07.047
Fantastic.
Do you think law school's in your future?

09:07.047 --> 09:11.176
I'm not sure yet,
but I do know that the system is broken.

09:12.636 --> 09:17.182
And sometimes they treat people
who are in need like they're criminals.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.476
I wanna fix that.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.439
If you'd like,
it would be great to have you

09:24.439 --> 09:26.400
and your mom observe a class today.

09:26.984 --> 09:29.987
I'd really like that. Thank you.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.578
No. Don't do it. Don't.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.876
Hey, Dr. Lawson,
can we have an extension on our outline?

09:44.418 --> 09:49.464
We just need another day to...
elevate the material.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.719
Why would you get an extension
over everyone else?

09:55.304 --> 09:57.472
Actually, Dr. Lawson,

09:58.932 --> 10:01.018
I'm really passionate
about this assignment.

10:02.060 --> 10:06.148
It's just taking me a while

10:07.274 --> 10:09.359
to put it all into words, you know?

10:09.359 --> 10:10.819
Get all my thoughts together.

10:10.819 --> 10:13.363
Let me have a private word
with Mr. Carson.

10:21.371 --> 10:25.292
Finish this sentence,
"To whom much has been given..."

10:25.292 --> 10:26.376
"Much is expected."

10:27.753 --> 10:30.547
- So you have heard that.
- Yes.

10:33.008 --> 10:36.178
If I understand correctly,
you are on the cusp of 18.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.433
- Yes, but what does that--
- As a young man,

10:41.433 --> 10:45.270
I expect you to be acutely mindful
and acutely prepared,

10:46.063 --> 10:50.651
not just on the hardwood,
Mr. Carson. Understood?

10:51.693 --> 10:52.986
Understood.

10:56.365 --> 10:59.743
- Krista Cooke.
- Krista, it's Joe Warrick.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.370
Coach Joe Warrick.

11:01.954 --> 11:03.497
<i>I thought you were behind bars.</i>

11:03.497 --> 11:05.165
I'm on probation right now.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.544
I'm trying to piece back my life
after all those false allegations.

11:08.544 --> 11:09.711
What do you want?

11:10.212 --> 11:13.882
I have something that a good journalist
like yourself may be interested in seeing.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.217
I doubt it.

11:15.217 --> 11:18.095
It's about the guys Crystal Jarrett
had attack me.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.264
<i>I know who they are.</i>

11:24.935 --> 11:27.312
You didn't realize she was behind it.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.735
Wasn't expecting to coach my son again. Thanks.

11:35.529 --> 11:37.865
Before y'all thank me,

11:37.865 --> 11:41.910
the athletic director made it a point
to remind me that I'm interim.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.997
So, I guess that holds for y'all as well.

11:44.997 --> 11:47.749
We'll keep the Swagger club team rolling

11:47.749 --> 11:49.001
and I'll head up the 15Us,

11:49.001 --> 11:53.213
if you prove yourself worthy
of the Cedar Cove way.

11:57.551 --> 11:58.385
Good morning.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.595
Morning.

11:59.595 --> 12:02.556
Lady and gentlemen,
Seymour Greyson at your service.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.766
- Coach Ike.
- Hi, Ike. It's a pleasure.

12:04.766 --> 12:06.351
- Meg.
- Meg.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.769
- Naim.
- Naim.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.023
- Welcome to Cedar Cove Prep.
- Thank you.

12:11.023 --> 12:13.609
They said you've been here for 35 years?

12:14.276 --> 12:15.694
- Thirty-eight.
- So,

12:15.694 --> 12:18.655
what's the secret to surviving
in a place like this?

12:18.655 --> 12:20.115
I wish I could say it was winning,

12:20.115 --> 12:24.244
but I think it's a combo play
of politician and coach.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.915
Might as well not unpack these boxes.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.000
Okay, I'll take these back then.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.797
- Hey, Sierra, ready for class?
- Yeah, just gotta write down...

13:05.202 --> 13:10.249
Steinbeck's plot focuses
on the migrants moving west.

13:10.249 --> 13:13.502
Thematically,
what does his narrative touch on?

13:14.086 --> 13:16.839
How a community can
help each other through challenging times.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.967
It reflects core American values of unity.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.388
Obviously, Christianity becomes a theme.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.516
All good points.
Let's continue the reading.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.434
Casey.

13:30.978 --> 13:34.356
"The concrete highway was edged
with a mat of tangled, broken, dry grass,

13:34.356 --> 13:38.068
and the grass heads were heavy
with oat beards to catch on a dog's coat,

13:38.068 --> 13:40.863
and foxtails to tangle
in a horse's fetlocks."

13:41.405 --> 13:44.283
Never thought Phil
would get the opportunity

13:44.283 --> 13:49.955
to go to a place like Cedar Cove,
but it's not a lot of Black faces though.

13:51.123 --> 13:55.419
I mean, right now he's got
Black classmates, Black teachers.

13:56.295 --> 14:01.049
Here it's almost all white.
Yeah, it's 15 to a class.

14:01.049 --> 14:04.595
There's like 35 students to a class
at Seat Pleasant.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.642
What do you think of this place?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.313
It's only my second day here.

14:14.313 --> 14:18.609
Yeah, but you took the job. How come?

14:19.109 --> 14:20.527
A place like this...

14:24.031 --> 14:28.660
it can either make a kid,
or it could break a kid.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.829
Break a kid, how?

14:31.455 --> 14:35.751
If Cedar Cove makes Phil think he has
to be someone other than himself,

14:36.835 --> 14:38.670
then it's destructive.

14:41.507 --> 14:45.385
But if he could keep it a hundred
and do well,

14:46.762 --> 14:50.307
I don't know, it could open up some doors.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.607
- The Jace Carson...
- Yeah, he coming.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.902
...taking time out
of his busy schedule to give me a tour?

15:01.902 --> 15:03.987
Wow, I'm honored.

15:03.987 --> 15:06.782
I'll leave you in his capable hands.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.867
Thanks for everything.

15:11.662 --> 15:14.164
What's up, Big Zero? What's good, boy?

15:14.164 --> 15:16.208
- What's up, bro?
- Cool, my man.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.544
- Hey, this place is crazy.
- What's up, Phil?

15:18.544 --> 15:22.130
Damn, y'all really pulling
out the red carpet for a brother.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.215
What's up, dawg?

15:23.215 --> 15:26.844
Hey, the best player need the best NFTs.
Let me put you on real quick.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.053
What?

15:33.058 --> 15:34.643
That does hit different.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.020
- Right?
- Okay.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.648
Hey, when you in your own lane,
Phil, there's no traffic.

15:39.648 --> 15:43.527
All right, look, you commit to Cedar Cove,
I'll consult you on your NIL portfolios.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.696
And, look,
between my debate team experience

15:45.696 --> 15:48.115
and my basketball skills,
I'm a one-stop shop.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.242
- He ain't lying.
- Okay, Royale.

15:50.242 --> 15:54.997
And listen, everyone comes to our games.
Think your little D1 offers are cool now?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.790
They'll triple the second you put on

15:56.790 --> 15:58.208
- a Cedar Cove jersey.
- That's right.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.543
Okay, Mendez.

16:00.836 --> 16:02.546
I didn't even see you coming, fool.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.966
I really do blend here, man.

16:05.966 --> 16:09.636
Get your chopsticks, bro.
They serve sushi in the cafeteria.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.221
- Real talk.
- For real?

16:11.221 --> 16:13.557
- Hi, Jace, who's your friend?
- Jessica,

16:13.557 --> 16:16.643
- this is your soon-to-be classmate, Phil.
- What's going on?

16:17.436 --> 16:19.062
- How you doing?
- Can I get a picture?

16:19.062 --> 16:21.148
- Why not?
- For sure.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.232
Come on, get in here.

16:26.278 --> 16:29.573
Your hair. It's so cool.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.658
Bye, guys.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.327
Wow.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.245
- Really?
- Oh, my God. Did you get it?

16:35.245 --> 16:36.455
- Oh, my-- Shit.
- Bruh.

16:36.455 --> 16:37.873
I feel you, no cap.

16:37.873 --> 16:41.335
- There's some things about this school.
- Yeah. Say less.

16:41.335 --> 16:44.254
Yo, at the end of the day, you got us.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.798
And come next year,
who knows where all of us are gonna be?

16:46.798 --> 16:48.050
Yeah, man.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.552
You're not supporting cast.
You're the missing piece.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.931
This is our last chance
to all be on the same team.

16:53.931 --> 16:56.600
If we gotta go out,
we should go out as brothers.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.809
- That's right.
- For real.

16:57.809 --> 16:58.977
Back together, bro.

16:58.977 --> 17:04.191
Big Phil, this could be the best
birthday present you ever gave me.

18:24.396 --> 18:25.898
Yo, big man.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.149
What's good, Crystal?

18:27.149 --> 18:30.569
I heard a rumor that you leaving us
for some country club school.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.653
Hi, Crystal.

18:31.653 --> 18:33.822
I haven't made my mind up yet.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.367
Basketball-wise,
I'd get way more visibility,

18:37.367 --> 18:41.371
but I don't know about the culture
over there where it's all cool

18:41.371 --> 18:45.083
for white kids to come up to me,
investigate my hair.

18:46.043 --> 18:51.048
But between you and me,
I think I'm in love.

18:51.924 --> 18:53.008
What? With who?

18:54.218 --> 18:55.511
I don't know her name.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.472
You don't know her name, but...

18:58.472 --> 19:01.058
- She the one though. Like...

19:01.683 --> 19:03.685
- Okay.
- Yo, you a bona fide menace.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.729
I'ma see you at Jace's birthday party?

19:08.899 --> 19:12.653
Nah, I have a game, so
can't make that one. Yeah.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.155
- All right, get buckets, son.
- Yeah.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.866
Thirty-piece. Yeah.

19:20.661 --> 19:23.914
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.458
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:27.626 --> 19:31.922
The opening day of the new
science building is finally here.

19:36.051 --> 19:39.555
It's all because of the generous donation
from the Gibbons family.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.478
But we wouldn't be here today

19:46.478 --> 19:50.566
if it weren't for
one very special student, Amber Gibbons,

19:51.483 --> 19:54.152
who has just received
early acceptance into MIT

19:54.152 --> 19:57.573
and is the very inspiration
for the building before you.

19:57.573 --> 20:00.158
And let's give it up
for our fearless leader,

20:00.158 --> 20:03.871
chairwoman of the board,
Diane Harrison-Fitzpatrick.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.461
You have to smile. Be nice.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.130
I'm nice.

20:13.130 --> 20:16.341
Diane secured
the generous $20 million donation

20:16.341 --> 20:19.761
from the Gibbons family
and matched it in grants.

20:21.346 --> 20:23.223
- Champagne? No?
- No, thanks.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.934
Hey. How about you? Champagne?

20:25.934 --> 20:27.019
All right.

20:27.019 --> 20:30.230
Yeah. Yeah, all right.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.776
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Hope you're well.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.404
Let's-- So, anyway...

20:40.657 --> 20:41.700
Megan Bailey.

20:42.451 --> 20:43.785
Camden Ryder, Senior.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.370
You owe me 20 bucks.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.496
Excuse me?

20:46.496 --> 20:48.749
For the loss against
the Pistons eight years ago.

20:49.541 --> 20:52.711
Wow. Okay.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.507
Your son CJ,
he's a promising young player.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.259
Happy to have him in the family business.

21:00.511 --> 21:03.180
You're the first female coach
he's ever had.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.390
That's not the first time I've heard that.

21:05.390 --> 21:11.480
Just so you know, I don't want you
to go easy on my son. He can take it.

21:13.690 --> 21:17.152
Diane Harrison-Fitzpatrick,
who needs no introduction.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.988
- It's lovely to meet you. Tonya.
- Pleasure--

21:19.988 --> 21:23.325
Pleasure to meet you.
And pleasure to meet you as well.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.661
I love what you've done with this place.

21:27.496 --> 21:30.499
As you know, Diane, the basketball team

21:30.499 --> 21:32.751
had earth-shattering success
under Coach Nichols,

21:32.751 --> 21:35.712
but the athletic department is thrilled

21:35.712 --> 21:39.132
to have Ike here on board
as the interim coach.

21:40.968 --> 21:44.304
He's taking night classes
towards his college degree

21:44.304 --> 21:46.765
and displaying a real commitment
to the Cedar Cove way.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.895
My son Johnny is on your team,

21:51.895 --> 21:54.481
and he's over the moon
to have you as his coach,

21:54.481 --> 21:57.651
so I can't wait to see what you do
at the season opener.

21:57.651 --> 22:00.153
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.530
Excuse me.

22:02.614 --> 22:05.075
...red wine.
I've been usually a Bordeaux kind of guy.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.328
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.542
I hope there are no hard feelings

22:13.542 --> 22:15.961
that Swagger decided not
to renew with Gladiator.

22:15.961 --> 22:18.672
No. No. No hard feelings at all. Stop.

22:18.672 --> 22:22.634
So, what brings you to the opening
of a science building?

22:22.634 --> 22:23.886
You didn't hear?

22:23.886 --> 22:25.762
Gladiator Sneakers is actually in business

22:25.762 --> 22:28.891
with a few prep schools,
namely Cedar Cove.

22:28.891 --> 22:31.351
So, as soon as that ink is dry,

22:31.351 --> 22:33.437
you guys will have some fresh new gear
coming your way.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.314
- Alonzo Powers.
- My man.

22:35.314 --> 22:37.274
I have someone I want you to meet.

22:37.274 --> 22:38.859
- Okay. Absolutely.
- Come this way. Excuse us.

22:38.859 --> 22:39.943
- Definitely.
- No worries.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.696
Sorry, Meg,
you haven't gotten rid of me yet.

22:47.910 --> 22:49.328
Did he say interim?

22:50.120 --> 22:52.247
Setting me up to fall on my face.

22:52.998 --> 22:54.917
You remember
when my ex-boyfriend came over

22:54.917 --> 22:56.793
to my parents' house for Sunday brunch,

22:56.793 --> 22:59.087
and you were there
to meet my entire family?

22:59.087 --> 23:02.549
I couldn't go out like a punk in front
of your grandma and Uncle Bobby.

23:03.467 --> 23:06.887
You won the charm offense,
and I sent homeboy packing.

23:08.639 --> 23:09.806
Be that.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.642
- Champagne? Of course.
- Thank you.

23:12.309 --> 23:13.560
Let's light 'em up.

23:32.955 --> 23:34.915
- A toast to Ike and Tonya.
- Thank you.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.376
Yes!

23:37.376 --> 23:39.378
Don't get me wrong, I love working,

23:39.378 --> 23:42.381
but there's also that part
of me that feels guilty.

23:42.381 --> 23:45.926
No, no, no.
It's a job to be a stay-at-home mom.

23:45.926 --> 23:48.345
You just can't put it on your résumé.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.389
It's the hardest job I've ever had.

23:50.389 --> 23:52.766
I feel blessed to have been able
to have been there

23:52.766 --> 23:55.561
every step of the first few years
of my baby's life.

23:55.561 --> 23:59.314
It's complicated and we do it anyway.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.358
So, moms and-- Hello.

24:01.358 --> 24:02.526
- Hello, hello.
- Hey, baby.

24:02.526 --> 24:04.653
Good to see you. Good to see you.
Good to see you.

24:04.653 --> 24:06.572
- You came to save me?
- You enjoying yourself?

24:06.572 --> 24:07.489
Definitely.

24:07.489 --> 24:11.285
Look, we're begging you, big homey,
please give us the exclusive, all right.

24:11.285 --> 24:15.747
Do it not only for the culture
but for our loyal subscribership.

24:17.332 --> 24:20.169
Phil "My Bad" Marksby.

24:20.169 --> 24:22.296
My melanin-lacking brother.

24:22.296 --> 24:26.550
Where will you be playing basketball
this season?

24:29.094 --> 24:30.679
After much discussion,

24:32.222 --> 24:36.351
this season,
I will be bringing my talents to...

24:42.399 --> 24:44.276
- Swagger Prep!
- Yo! Y--

24:47.070 --> 24:50.616
Yo! What? Dawg,
he just renamed our school on the pod--

24:50.616 --> 24:53.368
- He just renamed the whole school.
- Our podcast!

24:55.245 --> 24:58.290
That's our cue.
One last thing before we go, a PSA.

24:58.290 --> 25:01.960
Fellow white people,
this one's an oldie but a goody,

25:02.586 --> 25:06.256
please stop touching Black people's hair.

25:07.341 --> 25:08.509
You're crazy, Drew.

25:08.509 --> 25:10.928
- Drew, you really crazy, dawg.
- Swagger Prep!

25:12.429 --> 25:13.597
- Yeah?
- Yo.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.682
Yo. Great practice today.

25:16.225 --> 25:18.477
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, close the door.

25:21.647 --> 25:26.652
All right, so, Ohio State and Providence
hit me about you this morning

25:27.152 --> 25:29.863
and I just got off the phone
with the University of Memphis.

25:30.614 --> 25:33.283
All right, so there's a lot
of heat on you right now,

25:33.283 --> 25:35.619
and I just wanna know
where your head is at with it.

25:39.248 --> 25:40.249
I'm excited,

25:40.832 --> 25:43.252
but don't wanna to make any wrong moves.

25:43.252 --> 25:45.462
A coach could say he's dying to coach me,

25:46.004 --> 25:47.464
then have me riding the bench.

25:48.340 --> 25:51.593
You know what my strategy was
when I was getting recruited?

25:51.593 --> 25:52.845
What?

25:52.845 --> 25:55.055
Avoid a decision at all costs.

25:55.639 --> 25:59.560
Mine is be cool all day,
stress the hell out all night.

26:01.144 --> 26:02.354
Not getting much sleep?

26:03.981 --> 26:07.568
Nah. I kind of feel like something big
is about to happen.

26:11.321 --> 26:12.656
Well, look...

26:13.365 --> 26:16.493
It's not just coaches I'm hearing from.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.121
What do you mean?

26:20.497 --> 26:22.040
I heard from your pops.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.544
He's in town, and he wanna meet up
with you. I thou--

26:25.544 --> 26:26.628
Why is he calling you?

26:28.881 --> 26:32.009
He said you wasn't replying
to his messages

26:32.009 --> 26:33.677
and that he couldn't find a way
to reach your mom.

26:33.677 --> 26:36.138
There's a reason nobody wants
to talk to him.

26:37.598 --> 26:39.975
Jackie won't talk to him.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.145
My mom probably been blocked his number.

26:43.145 --> 26:45.397
Okay. So how do you want to handle it?

26:45.981 --> 26:48.400
Because he's been calling me
every month asking about your life.

26:51.236 --> 26:52.070
Hold on.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.406
Listen. I know why you're upset,

26:54.406 --> 26:56.700
but if I could do it all over again
with my pops--

26:56.700 --> 26:58.285
I gotta go.

27:29.149 --> 27:32.861
Birthday boy, it's been a while.
Good to hear from you.

27:36.698 --> 27:37.699
Yeah.

27:43.038 --> 27:44.581
Is something wrong?

27:48.794 --> 27:53.298
Coach told me that my father
really wanna see me.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.676
I don't really know how to feel
about that.

27:56.176 --> 27:57.928
I mean, with all that's going on.

27:59.513 --> 28:04.726
Recruiting pressure,
my school is hard as hell.

28:10.107 --> 28:13.318
I know I should be grateful...

28:15.779 --> 28:18.532
but all I wanna do is get back
to the court

28:18.532 --> 28:21.451
where everything disappears
for just a second.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.291
Honestly, Crys...

28:34.131 --> 28:36.592
I'm hoping you can come to my game

28:37.342 --> 28:42.306
'cause I don't really know how I'm gonna
do 18 without you.

28:45.976 --> 28:48.478
Hello?

29:17.090 --> 29:18.425
Hey, college boy.

29:20.302 --> 29:23.514
What does being in a geometry class at 33

29:23.514 --> 29:26.183
have to do with me
being a good basketball coach?

29:27.559 --> 29:30.604
Isn't basketball a game of angles?

29:30.604 --> 29:33.232
I don't wanna admit that's true
in this conversation.

29:35.943 --> 29:38.362
I had a job interview today at Cedar Cove.

29:38.362 --> 29:40.531
What? Why didn't you tell me?

29:40.531 --> 29:42.407
I just thought it was
some coach's wife coffee tour

29:42.407 --> 29:45.160
with the head of the school,
but turns out there's an opening

29:45.994 --> 29:48.830
in the Department
for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

29:48.830 --> 29:51.208
- And they want you?
- They made an offer.

29:52.084 --> 29:55.295
Told 'em I'd think about it.
What do you think?

29:55.295 --> 29:58.423
I think Cedar Cove would be lucky
to have you,

29:58.423 --> 30:00.676
as long as you're cool with
running into me.

30:00.676 --> 30:02.970
I'm kind of the big man
on campus now, but--

30:02.970 --> 30:04.930
Right, right. Well--

30:04.930 --> 30:06.014
I'm proud of you.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.100
Thanks, babe.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.143
I haven't said yes yet.

30:10.143 --> 30:12.646
You know I'm not trying to be the person
of color in the display window.

30:12.646 --> 30:15.524
- I'm sure you made that very clear.
- You know I did.

30:17.442 --> 30:18.777
What's this?

30:18.777 --> 30:21.238
I have to paint your fingernails.

30:23.282 --> 30:26.702
- I don't remember--
- You promised.

30:32.207 --> 30:33.667
<i>Yo, you okay?</i>

30:34.543 --> 30:36.503
Yeah, you busy?

30:38.088 --> 30:40.632
Kathryn is painting my fingernails.

30:40.632 --> 30:42.009
Don't ask.

30:44.887 --> 30:48.265
I don't need to. You a good dad.

30:53.103 --> 30:54.229
Thanks, man.

30:55.522 --> 31:00.777
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't let on
about your pops.

31:00.777 --> 31:02.487
I wanna meet up with him.

31:05.324 --> 31:06.533
Can you hook it up?

31:07.743 --> 31:10.078
Yeah. Yeah, I got you.

31:10.078 --> 31:11.496
<i>Thanks, Coach.</i>

31:12.206 --> 31:14.583
<i>All right. All right. Bye, man.</i>

31:28.222 --> 31:32.559
That is beautiful.
Look at that. Just amazing.

31:33.268 --> 31:36.355
Thank you so mu-- All right, you know.

31:37.356 --> 31:39.483
I think it looks great. What do you think?

31:40.400 --> 31:42.694
It needs a little stripe.

31:43.403 --> 31:47.324
Okay, a little stripe.
That should match the uniform perfectly.

31:47.324 --> 31:48.825
Thank you.

31:48.825 --> 31:51.411
Yo, look what the cat dragged in.

31:51.411 --> 31:54.206
You know I wouldn't miss
seeing my bighead brother turn 18.

31:54.206 --> 31:57.960
Plus, we all know that you prefer
when I make the birthday pancakes.

31:59.419 --> 32:00.420
Hey, Jack.

32:00.420 --> 32:01.922
Hey, old man.

32:03.006 --> 32:04.258
What's up?

32:05.217 --> 32:06.385
What's wrong?

32:09.721 --> 32:13.433
Coach told me our father's
been reaching out to him.

32:16.645 --> 32:18.480
He wants to meet me in person.

32:19.565 --> 32:20.732
When?

32:27.531 --> 32:28.532
Tonight.

32:33.328 --> 32:35.539
The night before your 18th birthday?

32:36.832 --> 32:37.875
Yeah.

32:41.753 --> 32:44.798
The season's about to start,
and you don't need any distractions.

32:44.798 --> 32:50.846
It's always a distraction...
whether I see him or not.

32:55.726 --> 32:57.186
I'm about to be a man.

32:58.312 --> 33:00.522
And you wanna handle this like a man.

33:03.150 --> 33:04.151
Yes.

33:06.612 --> 33:10.032
If that's what you need, I get it.

33:17.122 --> 33:18.832
When did you get in town?

33:20.417 --> 33:22.669
I wanted to say happy birthday in person.

33:25.255 --> 33:30.594
I didn't know what to get you,
so I got you this.

33:31.345 --> 33:33.055
Nah, man.

33:33.055 --> 33:35.390
$1800. Hundred every year.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.352
It's not a lot.

33:41.313 --> 33:43.482
But figured if I give you this,

33:43.482 --> 33:47.986
at least you could get something
that you want for yourself.

33:53.116 --> 33:57.079
If it's all right with you,
I'ma give this to my mom.

34:08.715 --> 34:13.344
I just needed to see you, man.

34:21.603 --> 34:23.230
I needed to see you too.

34:25.815 --> 34:27.818
I'm sure you got stuff
to get off your chest.

34:28.860 --> 34:30.112
I'm ready.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.034
I'm okay.

34:38.620 --> 34:40.371
I'm gonna be okay.

34:43.792 --> 34:47.670
I wanted to tell you that man-to-man.

34:55.304 --> 34:58.974
You know, for a while,
I thought I was sick or something.

34:58.974 --> 35:00.934
I thought there was something wrong
with me.

35:01.852 --> 35:05.522
Dead-ass. I didn't think you left Mom.

35:07.524 --> 35:11.236
It didn't even feel like you
left my sister.

35:11.236 --> 35:13.030
It felt like you left me.

35:16.033 --> 35:18.202
I thought something was wrong with me.

35:25.792 --> 35:27.419
But I need you to know...

35:31.089 --> 35:32.591
I'm okay.

35:49.066 --> 35:53.320
All right, so as president,
I would just like to say,

35:54.446 --> 35:56.782
happy birthday, Jace Carson.

35:59.576 --> 36:01.370
Thank you, thank you, thank you, y'all.

36:01.370 --> 36:04.456
Thank you.
Let's continue the meeting, please.

36:04.456 --> 36:10.629
All right, in my English class, you guys,
we are on our third white author in a row.

36:11.296 --> 36:14.842
Now, I really do doubt our teacher
means any harm

36:14.842 --> 36:18.804
because he's just so excited
about us reading a story

36:18.804 --> 36:20.639
featuring the migrants movement.

36:21.473 --> 36:24.852
However, we are learning
that 400,000 settlers

36:24.852 --> 36:26.520
- moved to the West, right?
- Right.

36:27.646 --> 36:28.897
What about the Harlem Renaissance

36:28.897 --> 36:32.609
where six million Black people moved
from the South to the North?

36:32.609 --> 36:36.488
And this just goes to show that,
once again, it's like our authors,

36:36.488 --> 36:38.866
our voices and our stories are silenced.

36:38.866 --> 36:39.992
Right.

36:39.992 --> 36:45.080
We are gonna be establishing
a committee to challenge the curriculum,

36:45.080 --> 36:47.791
and we are looking for some volunteers.

36:47.791 --> 36:50.544
- That's cool.
- For sure. Okay.

36:55.132 --> 36:58.218
I'm Phil Marksby. I'm new here,

36:59.219 --> 37:03.182
but I, for one, am down for the cause.

37:03.724 --> 37:05.809
Yeah.

37:05.809 --> 37:07.102
Okay, thank you.

37:11.481 --> 37:12.608
Man, what you doin'?

37:20.991 --> 37:25.162
Hey, Rae.
I could kick it with you for a minute?

37:30.584 --> 37:32.336
I'm pretty busy right now,

37:32.336 --> 37:34.338
but I'm sure that one of your teammates

37:34.338 --> 37:36.089
that are just looking
to get club membership

37:36.089 --> 37:38.133
on their college transcript
could help you out.

37:40.636 --> 37:44.848
Wow, so you got me
all figured out then, huh?

37:46.016 --> 37:47.100
Don't I?

37:53.190 --> 37:58.111
And now, your Cedar Cove Mustangs!

38:20.509 --> 38:22.177
Grown-ass man, happy birthday.

38:23.011 --> 38:25.389
Thanks. Appreciate it.

38:26.598 --> 38:29.101
Hey, why do I keep hearing people
call you interim?

38:30.185 --> 38:32.104
They say it's just a formality, so...

38:33.480 --> 38:35.357
Heard you gotta win to keep your job.

38:37.734 --> 38:40.821
Let's not find out. How was pops?

38:41.655 --> 38:42.865
It was all right.

38:43.699 --> 38:46.118
It takes a lot of energy
to stay mad at people.

38:48.871 --> 38:50.122
Thanks for connecting us.

38:52.082 --> 38:54.293
Jace Carson's mom's driving up.

39:01.466 --> 39:03.552
- Hey. Thank you.
- Hey, Ms. Carson.

39:30.871 --> 39:32.539
- Hey, Jackie.
- Crazy.

39:35.125 --> 39:36.210
I'm not doing this.

39:39.129 --> 39:41.298
Jackie. Baby girl.

39:41.298 --> 39:42.591
I'll be back.

39:44.301 --> 39:47.471
As long as you're here,
it's a little late for this.

39:47.471 --> 39:49.848
I know that cash is just a little drop
in the bucket, Jenna.

39:49.848 --> 39:52.559
But I can't take it back.

39:59.233 --> 40:00.275
Let's go, boys!

40:01.026 --> 40:02.277
You must be Alonzo Powers.

40:02.277 --> 40:04.780
Dr. Lawson.
Man, I can't wait to work with you.

40:05.280 --> 40:09.368
We should definitely talk.
The deal hit a bit of a snag.

40:10.077 --> 40:11.078
How so?

40:11.828 --> 40:14.122
Gladiator offered a one-year commitment.

40:14.623 --> 40:18.210
We-- I am looking for something longer.

40:18.710 --> 40:20.087
I see.

40:21.255 --> 40:24.925
Well, you guys have Jace Carson,
Nick Mendez

40:24.925 --> 40:28.053
and Phil Marksby as your starters,
but they're seniors.

40:28.053 --> 40:31.014
So convince me that you'll be
as dominant next year,

40:31.014 --> 40:33.141
and then we'll have something to discuss.

40:34.768 --> 40:39.523
My advice to you though,
don't get in our-- my way.

40:51.827 --> 40:52.703
Ball, ball, ball!

40:56.790 --> 40:57.708
Come on, Jace!

40:58.876 --> 41:00.627
Defense!

41:00.627 --> 41:02.212
Move left!

41:06.216 --> 41:07.217
We gotta find out.

41:14.266 --> 41:16.768
Oh, yes!

41:26.486 --> 41:27.613
Happy birthday.

41:33.202 --> 41:36.705
I heard glowing reviews
about your interview.

41:37.372 --> 41:41.543
Not to overstep,
but do you have any indication

41:41.543 --> 41:43.212
of which way you may be leaning?

41:45.964 --> 41:47.966
I haven't notified the head
of the school yet,

41:47.966 --> 41:51.470
but I've decided to take the job.

41:53.805 --> 41:56.183
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much for everything.

41:56.183 --> 41:57.351
Of course.

41:58.060 --> 42:00.020
There it is. High-- That's high.

42:05.067 --> 42:08.695
Hey, where's your head at?
Yo, where you at right now?

42:08.695 --> 42:10.113
Here, right here.

42:11.073 --> 42:13.492
Look at this pink fingernail.
You see this pink fingernail?

42:14.076 --> 42:15.077
What?

42:15.077 --> 42:17.955
I thought about scrubbing it off,
but then I thought,

42:18.747 --> 42:22.042
"This is where I am right now.
This is my new chapter."

42:22.042 --> 42:25.254
- Okay, Coach. I got it.
- Okay, then don't forget to play.

42:25.254 --> 42:27.673
- I am playing.
- Nah, man. Play.

42:32.135 --> 42:33.220
Everybody!

42:41.270 --> 42:42.187
Let's go!

42:43.438 --> 42:45.190
Let's go, let's go.

42:45.190 --> 42:47.025
- Cedar Cove on three.
- No, no, no!

42:47.526 --> 42:52.573
Forget Cedar Cove! Swagger Prep on three.
One, two, three!

42:52.573 --> 42:53.824
Swagger Prep!

42:53.824 --> 42:55.117
Let's go.

42:56.660 --> 42:59.830
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- Right.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.501
Bring that baby.

43:04.501 --> 43:05.586
Yeah.

43:08.422 --> 43:09.965
Yeah, let's go!

43:13.760 --> 43:15.470
<i>Here's what I would say.</i>

43:15.470 --> 43:19.933
<i>Know who you love, know what you believe
and know what you stand for.</i>

43:20.642 --> 43:21.977
<i>'Cause the truth of it is,</i>

43:22.561 --> 43:25.606
<i>playing ball has very little
to do with being a man,</i>

43:26.148 --> 43:30.235
<i>but being a man has everything
to do with how you play ball.</i>

43:35.699 --> 43:36.658
Let's go!

43:39.828 --> 43:41.496
Let's go!

43:52.799 --> 43:53.842
There he is!

43:53.842 --> 43:56.345
- Let's go!
- Let's go, Jace!

43:56.345 --> 43:58.514
Birthday boy!

44:00.265 --> 44:01.558
What you doing here?

44:03.018 --> 44:04.019
Yeah.

44:29.253 --> 44:34.716
- My Bad! My Bad! My Bad!
- My Bad!

44:35.592 --> 44:38.095
My Bad!

44:42.474 --> 44:44.059
My Bad! That's how you do it!

45:00.784 --> 45:02.411
Wait, hold up. Hold up.

45:08.542 --> 45:11.128
Yes! Way to hit, Johnny.

45:12.129 --> 45:16.133
Yeah! Yeah! Let's go!

45:18.093 --> 45:19.094
Go!

45:34.234 --> 45:35.485
Three!

45:42.242 --> 45:46.121
Yeah! Yeah!

46:01.595 --> 46:06.183
Jace Carson! Jace Carson!

46:07.643 --> 46:09.353
Jace Carson!

46:10.145 --> 46:14.233
Swagger Prep! Swagger Prep! Swagger Prep!

46:14.233 --> 46:24.535
Swagger Prep! Swagger Prep! Swagger Prep!

46:24.535 --> 46:29.081
Crystal Jarrett, sorry to bother you.
I'm Krista Cooke with the <i>Marylander</i>.

46:29.081 --> 46:30.666
I know who you are.

46:30.666 --> 46:33.335
Last season you wrote
I'm "so good, it's scary."

46:34.211 --> 46:35.504
And I meant it.

46:39.383 --> 46:40.717
I'm told you might have knowledge

46:40.717 --> 46:42.719
about who attacked Joe Warrick
four years ago.

46:46.682 --> 46:49.268
Swagger Prep! Swagger Prep! Swagger Prep!

46:53.730 --> 46:57.109
Swagger Prep! Swagger Prep!

46:57.109 --> 46:59.695
Hey! I see you, Coach!

47:01.238 --> 47:03.073
Whole world see you, kid.
