00:09.343 --> 00:10.928
NEEDLEMAN:
(WHISPERING) Did you come alone?

00:11.011 --> 00:12.012
(WHISPERING) Yes.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.639
What's the password?

00:13.722 --> 00:15.849
Okay. What's the password?
What's the password?

00:15.933 --> 00:17.768
(NORMALLY) Okay. I have no idea.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.936
Psst.

00:19.019 --> 00:23.899
Capital one, two, three,
lowercase four, five, six.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.150
(WHISPERING) Thank you.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.319
(NORMALLY) One, two,
three, four, five, six!

00:27.402 --> 00:29.238
NEEDLEMAN AND SMITTY: Enter, friend.

00:31.156 --> 00:35.244
Welcome to Needleman and Smitty's
vacation door emporium.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.787
I love vacation doors.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.871
That's right.

00:37.955 --> 00:41.500
Each of these doors was personally rescued
by us from the shredder,

00:41.583 --> 00:47.256
and guaranteed to deliver you to
an isolated, human-free destination.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.633
Okay. Oh, please. I can't wait.
Tell me, what do you got?

00:49.716 --> 00:55.264
Who wouldn't wanna chill out on a cruise
to an abandoned ship in the Arctic Circle?

00:55.347 --> 00:57.808
This vacation sounds cool.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.894
Shut up! I give the sales pitch,
you're the glamour model.

01:02.187 --> 01:06.191
Transyl-Romania is known
for blood-sucking vampires.

01:06.275 --> 01:11.154
But what doesn't suck are the deluxe
amenities of this musty, deserted castle.

01:13.323 --> 01:17.035
You'll have a rotten time
in this decaying cabin in the woods.

01:18.704 --> 01:21.081
-(GROANS)
-Nah, too fishy. What else you got?

01:21.164 --> 01:24.877
Soak up the sun at this condemned
Caribbean beach resort.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.880
Beach vacation!
Yes, yes, yes! That's the one!

01:27.963 --> 01:29.673
Excellent choice, my good man.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.509
This vacated vacation paradise is yours.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.594
Hold it.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.513
You're so sure that using a door
that was supposed to be shredded

01:36.597 --> 01:38.390
isn't against company policy?

01:38.473 --> 01:41.518
Oh, we don't say "against company policy."

01:41.602 --> 01:44.563
That's right. We say "debit or credit."

02:13.258 --> 02:15.344
FRITZ: Okay, everybody, are you ready?

02:15.427 --> 02:17.137
'Cause it's time to play...

02:17.221 --> 02:21.225
(IN UNISON) Wheel of Temporary Supervisor!

02:21.308 --> 02:22.851
Today's my lucky day, Roto.

02:22.935 --> 02:26.563
-Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Yes!
-(PURRING)

02:26.647 --> 02:27.648
Why is my name on there?

02:27.731 --> 02:30.567
When Fritz goes on vacation,
the wheel picks a temporary supervisor.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.945
I see the ambition
in your eyes, College Boy.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.613
You'd love to have me under your thumb,

02:34.696 --> 02:36.698
squishing me with your little
temporary supervisor thumb.

02:36.782 --> 02:38.408
-(GROWLS)
-Thumb? What are you...

02:38.492 --> 02:41.370
I've told you, Duncan.
I have no interest in Fritz's job, okay?

02:41.453 --> 02:43.372
-Uh-huh.
-I signed your ridiculous contract.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.708
Right. Like a two-faced charlatan like you
would honor a contract.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.711
-Two-face... What are you talking about?
-Come on. Let's go, wheel!

02:49.795 --> 02:51.880
Mama needs a temporary promotion!

02:51.964 --> 02:53.340
DUNCAN: Yes, yes, yes!

02:53.423 --> 02:55.509
-VAL: Come on, come on!
-DUNCAN: Yes, no, no, no!

02:57.052 --> 02:58.345
-Yes!
-CUTTER: Glad it's not me.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.306
Congratulations, Temporary Supervisor Val.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.934
Oh, I have so many fun things
planned for my employees.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.144
Mindfulness Mondays, Tamale Tuesdays,

03:06.228 --> 03:08.856
Waffle Wednesdays,
Friendly French Fry Fridays.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.357
What next, yoga? Uh-uh.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.234
Neither me nor my schedule is flexible.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.611
Yeah, yeah, let's hear it for Val.

03:14.695 --> 03:18.240
So much for my humble dream
of being temporary supervisor.

03:18.740 --> 03:23.078
I'll just throw away the only thing
I've ever wanted in my insignificant life.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.874
-Ah, great.
-(CHITTERS)

03:26.957 --> 03:29.626
-I can't even throw away my dreams right.
-TYLOR: Huh.

03:29.710 --> 03:34.590
Kinda goes against my better judgment,
but I feel a little sorry for him.

03:34.673 --> 03:39.094
Yeah. Yeah, Mom, you know how you always
told me, "Dreams can come true"? (SCOFFS)

03:39.178 --> 03:42.389
Yeah, well, uh,
I learned today that they can't.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.642
(VOICE BREAKING)
No, don't cry. Don't cry, Mom.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.562
-(SIGHS)
-I tried my best. I did. I did.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.439
I'll cry for the both of us.

03:50.522 --> 03:53.025
-Uh, Fritz?
-Huh?

03:53.108 --> 03:54.902
Looks like I made an oopsie.

03:54.985 --> 03:58.280
The temporary supervisor is Duncan.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.073
Me? <i>Moi?</i>

04:00.157 --> 04:01.450
(GASPS) The fates have chosen.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.243
Well, uh, Mr. Fritz, sir,

04:03.327 --> 04:06.413
there's no way I can match your
robust managerial skills, blah-blah-blah,

04:06.496 --> 04:08.457
but I will do my best
to make you proud, sir,

04:08.540 --> 04:10.876
and, uh, supervise the team.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.431
(SINGING) <i>So I'm waving goodbye</i>

04:24.515 --> 04:25.891
<i>And while I'm gone</i>

04:25.974 --> 04:30.187
I expect you all to maintain
the get-along, MIFTer spirit.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.023
Get Along's my middle name, sir.
Duncan P. "Get Along" Anderson.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.610
Now, you go get yourself a creepy colada
and make some memories!

04:36.693 --> 04:39.530
(SINGING) <i>I'm getting sand in my toes</i>

04:39.613 --> 04:40.697
-Have a great time.
-Enjoy.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.158
(SINGING) <i>And I'll see ya in two weeks</i>

04:43.242 --> 04:46.203
<i>Bon voyage-e!</i> (CHUCKLES)

04:47.996 --> 04:49.414
Hmm...

04:49.498 --> 04:53.710
Well, well, well.
Looks like I'm now the supervisor.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.212
-"Temporary."
-Supervisor.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.922
-For a limited time. (GROANS)
-Supervisor!

04:57.005 --> 05:00.217
And that means that everybody
has to do whatever I say.

05:01.134 --> 05:05.514
Now, who's under whose thumb, College Boy?
Squishy-squish-squish.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.141
(SIGHS) I hope you did the right thing.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.479
<i>-(DOOR</i> OPENS)
-DUNCAN: (OVER MEGAPHONE) <i>Ahem.</i>

05:18.986 --> 05:20.571
Hear ye, hear ye.

05:20.654 --> 05:25.075
<i>Now presenting his Supervisorship,</i>
<i>Duncan P. Anderson.</i>

05:25.158 --> 05:26.159
<i>Huzzah.</i>

05:28.954 --> 05:31.832
"Dearest Mother,
I have clawed my way to the middle,

05:31.915 --> 05:34.459
"and I now command a capable workforce."

05:34.543 --> 05:36.503
-Read that last bit back to me.
-I got it.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.505
-Read it back.
-"Dearest Mother..."

05:38.589 --> 05:41.216
-With enthusiasm.
-"Dearest Mother..."

05:41.300 --> 05:43.594
To my supervisory chambers,
and be quick about it.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.678
Chop-chop.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.598
Chop-chop, chop-chop, chop-chop.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.391
Ah.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.645
Hmm. Not good enough, Roto.
It's not good enough.

05:53.729 --> 05:57.024
Well, maybe the fifth time
will be the charm, College Boy.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.651
Up here, College Boy.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.904
Down there, College Boy.
Open your eyes, College Boy.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.739
Here, College Boy.
Over there, College Boy.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.909
DUNCAN: (REPEATING) College Boy!

06:11.955 --> 06:13.332
Pick up the pace, College Boy.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.293
Mr. Sullivan wants these old canisters
emptied by Friday.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.046
Too bad for you scream power's
a thing of the past, huh?

06:20.172 --> 06:21.423
Boombox!

06:25.260 --> 06:27.721
Back on canister duty, huh?
Glad I'm not you.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.556
That job's monotonous.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.141
Drive a monster crazy.

06:31.225 --> 06:35.604
I'll tell you who's crazy. Duncan.
Crazy with temporary supervisor power.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.731
-(GRUNTS)
-Hey, hey, hey, hey! Careful.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.734
You damage the valve of one of these,
even ones with barely any juice,

06:40.817 --> 06:43.445
it'll knock a monster your size
halfway across the room.

06:43.529 --> 06:45.364
Or if you're Duncan-size...

06:46.657 --> 06:48.367
...all the way across the room.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.327
Just sayin'.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.083
-TYLOR: Oh!
-(CHUCKLING)

06:56.166 --> 06:57.251
Whoops.

06:58.794 --> 07:01.421
You think that's funny, huh,
Mr. Jokester? (YELPS)

07:01.505 --> 07:04.049
Did I do that?
I guess I need better supervising.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.134
Oh, I'll supervise you.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.970
-TYLOR: No. Duncan. No, no.
-What are you doing?

07:08.053 --> 07:09.805
-No, that's... Let go of that.
-(LAUGHING)

07:09.888 --> 07:11.849
Okay, that's a bad idea, Duncan.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.101
-TYLOR: Duncan, let go!
-(SCREAMS)

07:14.184 --> 07:15.269
TYLOR: Okay.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.022
No!

07:22.359 --> 07:23.402
TYLOR: Run, run!

07:26.113 --> 07:28.031
-This is your fault!
-My fault?

07:35.205 --> 07:36.832
Mama!

07:38.792 --> 07:40.794
-(BLABBERING)
-Whoa! Whoa!

07:47.301 --> 07:48.343
Oh.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.095
-Huh?
-High score!

07:50.179 --> 07:51.263
Aw.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.349
-EMPLOYEE MONSTER: Uh-oh.
-Whoa.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.434
What caused that?

07:55.517 --> 07:57.394
Relax, Sulley, relax.
I'm sure it's nothing.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.647
See? Emergency power. Everything's A-okay.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.108
Mike, Sulley,
power's out in the entire city.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.693
-M.E.R.C.'s on the phone.
-M.E.R.C.?

08:04.776 --> 08:06.778
-M.E.R.C.
-Murray's Eye and Retina Center?

08:06.862 --> 08:08.906
Has it been six months
since my last appointment?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.283
No. M.E.R.C.-M.E.R.C., not Murray M.E.R.C.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.535
Monstropolis Energy Regulatory Commission.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.662
They're sending an investigator.

08:15.746 --> 08:16.914
So, not Murray?

08:17.789 --> 08:18.957
I'm just being clear.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.184
Oh, no, not him.

08:37.267 --> 08:41.188
That's Argus Blinks.
He hasn't taken a day off in 20 years.

08:41.271 --> 08:44.983
If he finds a problem, he'll shut us down.
This could be the end of laugh power.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.405
Argus Blinks, M.E.R.C. Investigator.

08:50.489 --> 08:53.158
James P. Sullivan,
CEO, Monsters, Incorporated.

08:53.242 --> 08:56.453
Yes, "Mr. Laugh Energy,"
I know who you are.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.955
Is that good or bad?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.249
I am here to determine
the cause of today's blackout,

09:00.332 --> 09:04.294
and whether or not a shutdown
or a change in management is in order.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.088
You'll have our full cooperation, sir.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.590
Full cooperation!
Now, if you could please sign in.

09:10.425 --> 09:11.510
What is this?

09:11.593 --> 09:13.387
That? Oh! (CHUCKLES)

09:13.470 --> 09:14.847
That's my lunch money.

09:14.930 --> 09:17.683
-Or it could be your lunch money.
-(SULLEY CLEARS THROAT)

09:17.766 --> 09:18.767
(SOFTLY) Mike.

09:18.851 --> 09:20.435
Are you trying to bribe me?

09:20.519 --> 09:22.813
(NORMALLY) No, no, of course he's not.
(SOFTLY) Put that away.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.897
That's so silly.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.066
By chance,
did you drop these box seat tickets

09:26.149 --> 09:27.734
to the Monstropolis Creepees game, uh,

09:27.818 --> 09:30.070
row double-A,
seats one through three, free food?

09:30.153 --> 09:32.155
Was that possibly yours, by any chance?

09:32.239 --> 09:35.993
-(NORMALLY) Are those my tickets?
-Your office, if you please.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.452
Right this way, sir.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.456
Welcome, sir. Mr. Wazowski wants us
to bribe you with a brand-new...

09:41.540 --> 09:42.541
Not now, boys. Not now.

09:42.624 --> 09:43.625
Excuse the car, sir.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.752
It's "Park Anywhere You Want" Day today.

09:45.836 --> 09:46.920
Hmm...

09:47.754 --> 09:49.131
Here's a 50. Get rid of the car.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.091
Wait, a 20. Here's a 20,
get rid of the car.

09:51.175 --> 09:53.343
You know what? Forget it.
Just get rid of the car.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.556
Almost. (GRUNTING)

09:59.433 --> 10:01.226
You got one more up there, kiddo.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.526
Forget that last canister.
It's not goin' anywhere.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.486
Tylor! You're not gonna believe this.

10:11.570 --> 10:13.280
Power's out all over Monstropolis.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.575
A M.E.R.C. investigator is on his way.
Heads are gonna roll...

10:16.658 --> 10:19.286
Whoa. What happened?

10:19.369 --> 10:20.829
-Duncan did it.
-College Boy did it.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.581
-You're in charge.
-It's not about me.

10:22.664 --> 10:23.665
I say you both did it.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.626
-It was your idea.
-Yeah. It's your fault.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.044
-You acted on it.
-Not about me.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.795
-You're all accountable.
-DUNCAN: Not about me.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.507
So are you. If it wasn't for you,
Duncan wouldn't be supervisor.

10:31.590 --> 10:34.927
-I can't lose my pension over this.
-I can't lose my shot at the Laugh Floor.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.011
Okay, okay. All right.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.014
The only way to save our jobs
is to hide all the evidence

10:39.097 --> 10:41.225
and make sure
nobody ever finds out the truth.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.727
I don't know.
Sounds like you're suggesting a cover-up.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.229
No! Not a cover-up.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.732
Just a thing where we all conspire
to avoid accountability for our actions.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.025
-So, a cover-up.
-(CHUCKLING) No!

10:50.108 --> 10:54.238
Why is this concept so difficult to grasp?
Not a cover-up.

10:55.781 --> 10:58.825
Mr. Blinks, you sure you don't want us
to take you to the control room?

10:58.909 --> 11:02.871
Not necessary, Mr. Sullivan.
My eyes can see everything from here.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.963
-(SULLEY SHUDDERS)
-Ugh, that's disturbing.

11:11.046 --> 11:13.215
That's comin' from a guy
who's nearly 100% eye.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.593
My highly-trained inspection orbs
will seek out the malfunction

11:16.677 --> 11:18.929
and report back to me what happened,

11:19.012 --> 11:23.058
-and who is responsible.
-Ugh!

11:53.297 --> 11:55.257
DUNCAN: It's not a cover-up, okay?

11:55.340 --> 11:58.552
As your supervisor, you're hiding it
from view with a large tarp.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.762
And you, as my subordinate, do as I say!

12:00.846 --> 12:03.348
Why is this supervisor thing
so important to you anyway?

12:03.432 --> 12:06.643
If you think that bein' supervisor
someday is all I've ever wanted,

12:06.727 --> 12:10.439
and that messin' this up is somehow
gonna crush my hopes and dreams,

12:10.522 --> 12:12.232
then that's, uh, you know...

12:13.567 --> 12:16.153
Oh, Duncan, I, uh... I didn't mean to...

12:16.236 --> 12:17.362
It's none of your business.

12:17.446 --> 12:19.072
-Now, get to work.
-Okay, fine.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.867
But once I'm done covering it up,
this cover-up is complete.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.243
DUNCAN: Stop saying, "cover-up!"

12:23.327 --> 12:25.037
Okay, as supervisor, I say we call it,

12:25.120 --> 12:28.457
"Operation Hide All the Evidence and Make
Sure Nobody Ever Finds Out the Truth."

12:28.540 --> 12:31.960
-TYLOR: Yeah, that's much more covert.
-Yep, covert and secretive.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.091
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.927
Mmm-hmm? Mmm-hmm?

12:41.720 --> 12:42.971
Hmm.

12:43.055 --> 12:47.392
It appears the cause for the power outage
is inconclusive.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.019
I guess you won't shut us down today.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.105
If you pack up your creepy-eye suitcase,
I'll gladly show you the way out.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.193
-Just one moment.
-(POPPING)

12:56.276 --> 12:59.071
Hmm. Mmm-hmm?

12:59.154 --> 13:00.405
Yes.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.241
Well, I stand corrected.

13:02.324 --> 13:05.285
I seem to have found those responsible.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.873
As the Facilities Team here
at Monsters, Incorporated,

13:09.957 --> 13:13.001
all of you are in violation
of numerous M.E.R.C. codes,

13:13.085 --> 13:15.420
as eye-witnessed by my eyes.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.130
-And as supervisor, M...
-"Temporary."

13:17.214 --> 13:20.133
Temporary supervisor,
Mr. Duncan P. Anderson,

13:20.217 --> 13:22.678
you are responsible
for the actions of your team.

13:22.761 --> 13:26.098
You should be fired,
or, better yet, banished!

13:26.682 --> 13:27.683
Banished?

13:29.768 --> 13:30.811
-Me?
-Hey, wait.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.605
Come on, it's his first day as supervisor.
Give him a break.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.148
Give him a break?

13:35.232 --> 13:38.443
I've been working non-stop
as a M.E.R.C. official for 20 years,

13:38.527 --> 13:40.028
and no one's ever given me a brea...

13:45.242 --> 13:46.243
DUNCAN: Is he...

13:46.326 --> 13:48.412
-(RATTLING)
-Oh.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.832
Oh, well.
I'll log him in my accident journal.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.876
-We gotta get rid of the body.
-What?

13:53.959 --> 13:55.460
I mean, check his pulse, obviously.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.130
-He's alive.
-Oh, hurray.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.506
Aw.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.425
Looks like he finally got his break.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.801
Break. Give him a break.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.303
(GASPS) Good idea, me!

14:04.386 --> 14:06.305
We can hide him in the vacation door!

14:06.388 --> 14:08.724
Oh, of course, yes, vacation door.
Perfect. Right.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.809
-Come on.
-Oh. Okay, this is gross.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.936
Everything's wet. Why is everything wet?

14:13.020 --> 14:14.730
-I'll tie the tentacles in a knot.
-Gross.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.356
Is this the right thing to do?

14:16.440 --> 14:18.650
I'm gonna remain neutral
until I see what happens.

14:18.734 --> 14:21.320
-This is so gross. (GRUNTS)
-The eye is looking at me.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.614
-The eye is looking at me.
-Whoa, oh. Yep, yep, yep.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.282
Almost there, almost there.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.366
And in he go...

14:33.207 --> 14:35.834
Ouch. I felt that. But he didn't.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.878
Come on, let's send him on his holiday.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.508
TYLOR: Oh, one of his thingies...

14:42.591 --> 14:43.926
-DUNCAN: Goodbye.
-Yeah, there you go.

14:45.260 --> 14:49.056
Guys? I am pretty sure disposing of a body
may be another banishable offense.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.974
That was the only thing we could do.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.769
His work-life balance
was totally out of whack, all right?

14:53.852 --> 14:55.729
-Duncan?
-Right. College Boy is right.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.106
We'll make a pact.
None of us will speak of this again.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.108
We take this to our graves.
Nobody saw nothin'.

15:00.192 --> 15:01.360
-Well...
-Nobody saw nothin'!

15:02.819 --> 15:03.820
Mmm-hmm?

15:06.949 --> 15:08.075
Shh!

15:08.158 --> 15:12.746
(WHISPERING) We need to close the case.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.546
BOTH: Close it!

15:20.629 --> 15:22.464
-Ugh! (EXCLAIMS)
-Get those eyes!

15:23.590 --> 15:24.675
DUNCAN: Get it, get it!

15:24.758 --> 15:26.969
-Smash it! Yeah!
-No, no, no, no. (GRUNTS)

15:30.639 --> 15:31.640
Aha!

15:31.723 --> 15:32.975
No, there it goes.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.373
-Aha!
-Yes!

16:02.171 --> 16:03.505
-Incoming.
-(GRUNTS)

16:10.846 --> 16:13.182
-Yah! Bleh!
-(POPS)

16:16.226 --> 16:18.020
And problem solved.

16:18.562 --> 16:19.563
Done and done.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.398
Not quite. Fritz is still in there.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.901
Whatever. Fritz ain't coming back
for two weeks.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.444
I'll figure somethin' out.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.244
All right, kiddos, it's been two weeks.
What do you got?

16:34.328 --> 16:35.579
-I got nothin'.
-I got nothin'.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.997
CUTTER: Well, here goes nothin'.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.550
That was, without a doubt...

16:49.801 --> 16:52.137
the best vacation of my life!

16:52.221 --> 16:53.222
Wow!

16:53.305 --> 16:55.766
I believe it, Argus.
'Cause you really needed to unwind.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.309
-Mmm-hmm. Hmm.
-You're very wound.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.728
So, uh, you're doing okay?

16:59.811 --> 17:01.355
I'm more than okay.

17:01.438 --> 17:05.234
Sipping creepy coladas,
napping beneath the palms,

17:05.317 --> 17:07.236
cha-chaing the night away.

17:07.319 --> 17:08.320
(SINGING) <i>Cha-cha-cha-cha...</i>

17:08.403 --> 17:10.280
Argus? You're still here?

17:10.364 --> 17:12.074
Yeah, I thought you left two weeks ago.

17:12.157 --> 17:14.368
Oh, no. I took a little time off.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.411
I have your MIFT crew to thank.

17:16.495 --> 17:19.289
You are welcome.
And that is the last we will speak of it.

17:19.373 --> 17:22.167
Well, of course,
I will be writing all of you up,

17:22.251 --> 17:24.795
but just a warning this time.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.839
Goodbye, Mr. Laugh Energy.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.257
(SINGING) <i>Cha-cha-cha-cha-uh-uh...</i>

17:28.340 --> 17:31.218
(SIGHS) That was too close.
We were nearly shut down.

17:31.301 --> 17:34.054
You caused a major power outage,
conspired to cover it up,

17:34.137 --> 17:37.015
and if that weren't enough,
attempted to bribe a M.E.R.C. official.

17:37.516 --> 17:40.102
-Mike, that was you.
-Stay on point, Sulley, stay on point.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.687
Is all this true?

17:42.521 --> 17:43.605
Duncan?

17:43.856 --> 17:46.525
(SIGHING) Yes, sir.

17:48.569 --> 17:50.487
Oh, this is all my fault.

17:51.530 --> 17:54.908
I tipped the wheel so that Duncan
could be temporary supervisor.

17:54.992 --> 17:57.744
Well, regardless of how
he became temporary supervisor,

17:57.828 --> 17:59.746
it all happened on your watch, Duncan.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.791
And any of these accusations
is grounds for dismissal.

18:04.585 --> 18:05.586
Dismissal?

18:07.588 --> 18:08.672
Um...

18:10.132 --> 18:12.467
Temporary supervisor's, uh...

18:12.551 --> 18:15.762
(SNIFFLING) Well, he's gotta go down
with his temporary ship...

18:16.471 --> 18:17.472
I guess.

18:18.849 --> 18:22.519
So, uh, Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Wazowski...

18:22.603 --> 18:23.812
I'm sorry, I...

18:23.896 --> 18:26.857
I'm the one that caused the outage, okay?

18:26.940 --> 18:31.528
Duncan, he was just trying
to be a good supervisor.

18:32.070 --> 18:36.533
So if anyone deserves
to be dismissed, it's me.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.370
-The truth is...
-Yeah, well...

18:40.454 --> 18:41.496
No, no, no.

18:41.580 --> 18:44.750
The power outage
and, you know, all the other stuff,

18:44.833 --> 18:46.210
that was my fault, too.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.712
Though I am significantly
less at fault than him.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.883
Hmm. I am so proud of you two.

18:53.467 --> 18:56.261
Not only have you displayed
that get-along, MIFTer spirit,

18:56.345 --> 18:58.722
you've shown that
you're willing to sacrifice one another.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.557
BOTH: "Sacrifice for one another"?

19:00.641 --> 19:03.018
That, too. So, Mr. W, Mr. S,

19:03.101 --> 19:07.814
what do you say we forget all the
dismissal jumbo-mumbo-bumbo-bimble?

19:07.898 --> 19:10.234
Speaking of dismissal mumbo jumbo,

19:10.317 --> 19:13.695
what about that "against company policy"
vacation door?

19:13.779 --> 19:15.822
Taken care of, Sulley.
I'm having it shredded.

19:15.906 --> 19:19.159
Mr. Wazowski, we're here
to take the vacation door to your office.

19:20.369 --> 19:21.912
Our office?

19:39.346 --> 19:41.014
"Knock-knock."
(DEEP VOICE) "Who's there?"

19:41.098 --> 19:42.599
(NORMALLY) "I." (DEEP VOICE) "I, who?"

19:42.683 --> 19:45.143
"I am here to teach you
about knock-knock jokes."

19:46.270 --> 19:47.563
You see how easy that is?

19:47.646 --> 19:49.898
A simple knock and response
leads to laughter.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.025
Yes, Chuck, question?

19:52.109 --> 19:54.319
Uh, yeah, shouldn't there be a door?

19:54.403 --> 19:56.822
No. That's the beauty of it.
No door is required.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.824
Well, then what do you knock on?

19:58.907 --> 20:00.117
You don't knock on anything.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.327
-I'm confused.
-It doesn't make sense.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.662
It's simple. (CLEARS THROAT)

20:03.745 --> 20:06.373
I say, "Knock-knock."
And you respond, "Who's there?"

20:06.456 --> 20:08.876
Why would I ask who's there?
I can see you.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.586
You're standing right in front of us.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.671
-That's why you need a door.
-Or a barrier.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.089
Yes, yes! You need a door.

20:14.173 --> 20:16.466
You don't need a door, okay?
You don't need a door.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.468
I say, "Knock-knock."
You say, "Who's there?"

20:18.552 --> 20:20.888
I say something like, "orange."
You say, "Orange, who?"

20:20.971 --> 20:22.848
But you're not orange,
you're clearly green.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.183
That doesn't seem like a joke.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.102
This is a classic setup.
It's "Knock-knock." "Who's there?"

20:27.186 --> 20:29.229
-You're asking me to lie to kids.
-He's right.

20:29.313 --> 20:31.815
Knocking on a fake door,
misrepresenting yourself.

20:31.899 --> 20:34.067
-It's all very suspect.
-I don't like lying to kids.

20:34.151 --> 20:36.778
-Yeah, that's against company policy.
-Don't make me lie.

20:36.862 --> 20:37.863
It's okay, Chuck.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.323
We just won't answer the door,

20:39.406 --> 20:42.284
no matter how much he fake knocks
and lies about who he is.

20:42.367 --> 20:44.286
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
I can't take it anymore.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.579
It's just a simple thing.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.372
"Knock-knock." "Who's there?"

20:47.456 --> 20:50.626
That's how it works. It's called humor.

23:33.664 --> 23:36.542
DUNCAN:<i> Hey, Ma. We're gonna make it.</i>
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

23:37.042 --> 23:40.337
<i>I know you were dependin' on that</i>
<i>temporary supervisor money comin' in.</i>

23:40.420 --> 23:41.547
<i>No, I love you, too.</i>

23:42.047 --> 23:43.924
<i>Turn up your hearing aid, Ma!</i>
