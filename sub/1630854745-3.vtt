WEBVTT

00:06.466 --> 00:08.366
This body's been here
twelve months at least.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.733
Care to hazard
a cause of death?

00:09.866 --> 00:11.000
Blunt force cranial damage.

00:11.132 --> 00:12.800
- Someone smashed her head in?
- Not her.

00:12.933 --> 00:15.333
<i>We've got a DNA match
for the lad in the woods.</i>

00:15.466 --> 00:16.733
The same DNA as Sally Palmer?

00:16.866 --> 00:18.800
<i>Alan Ratcliffe,
a close blood relative.</i>

00:18.933 --> 00:21.400
Ah, yes. I remember Alan.

00:21.533 --> 00:23.333
I treated him for Lyme disease.

00:23.466 --> 00:25.666
<i>That's Dr Maitland, Henry.</i>

00:25.800 --> 00:27.066
Has he always been in a chair?

00:27.200 --> 00:29.766
Road accident. He lost his wife
in the accident.

00:31.666 --> 00:33.200
No, no, you're wet.
Your clothes are all wet.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.533
Whose clothes are these?

00:40.200 --> 00:41.500
How's Granddad?

00:41.633 --> 00:43.033
In the bedroom, sleeping.

00:43.166 --> 00:44.600
I'm at George Mason's caravan,
top end of Farnham Woods.

00:44.733 --> 00:46.633
I've just found him dead.
Decorated like the others.

00:46.766 --> 00:47.833
I think it's all Dan.

00:47.966 --> 00:49.900
You shouldn't be here,
Dr Hunter.

00:50.033 --> 00:51.600
You can't be here!

00:54.333 --> 00:56.633
I've got her, I've got Jenny.
She's gone into hypo.

00:56.766 --> 00:58.533
Henry! Check her pulse.

00:58.666 --> 01:00.700
Ambulance are on the way.
How's she doing?

01:02.200 --> 01:03.966
- Hmm, what?
- I'm sorry, David.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.065
How about Belize?

02:09.699 --> 02:12.000
There's a giant marine sinkhole
just off the coast

02:12.200 --> 02:14.200
called the Great Blue Hole.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.400
Jacques Cousteau said it was
one of the best diving sites.

02:18.766 --> 02:20.032
Midnight parrot fish,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.032
turtles,

02:23.200 --> 02:24.600
Caribbean reef sharks.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.065
It's 150 metres deep.

02:31.766 --> 02:33.200
They'd never find us down there.

02:33.300 --> 02:34.833
Amongst the sharks.

02:36.733 --> 02:37.800
Safer than here.

02:38.766 --> 02:39.933
And we get to be together.

02:42.065 --> 02:44.733
Don't you want to swim
with a turtle?

02:47.999 --> 02:48.965
What?

02:51.633 --> 02:53.200
What the fuck?

02:58.366 --> 02:59.800
Please, Henry.

03:01.233 --> 03:02.733
Get in the car.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.200
Now.

03:29.965 --> 03:30.866
Please!

03:42.433 --> 03:44.633
You have done this!

04:09.333 --> 04:10.965
Hello, Dr Maitland.

04:15.766 --> 04:16.866
Dan.

04:17.964 --> 04:18.899
Is he hurt?

04:22.433 --> 04:23.466
Yes.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.366
Like a bird
who's lost his wing, yeah?

04:29.466 --> 04:30.766
Yeah.

04:32.032 --> 04:34.366
Mr Anders says
when animals are hurt,

04:34.500 --> 04:36.266
you have to give them
back to nature, yeah?

04:37.333 --> 04:39.065
That's right.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.633
And we don't want any of God's
creatures suffering, do we?

04:42.766 --> 04:43.999
No.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.833
If you want, Dr Maitland,
I can take it from here.

04:48.999 --> 04:50.766
I know what he needs.

04:51.800 --> 04:52.932
Thank you, Dan.

04:53.865 --> 04:55.233
That's very kind of you.

04:56.932 --> 04:59.999
Maybe we shouldn't
tell anyone about this.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.932
We don't want them to be sad.

05:02.065 --> 05:03.466
Yeah, no.

05:05.099 --> 05:08.200
Perhaps you could swing by
the surgery tomorrow?

05:08.300 --> 05:09.832
You want me to cut the grass?

05:10.832 --> 05:11.999
Yes, Dan...

05:13.300 --> 05:15.065
I do.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.400
Okay.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.032
I love you, you know that?

05:59.999 --> 06:02.233
We'll work it out, I promise.

06:02.366 --> 06:04.633
Things will be better than ever.

06:45.899 --> 06:48.999
<i>Afraid all my life now</i>

06:50.233 --> 06:54.200
<i>Got no time for the dark in me</i>

06:54.333 --> 06:58.266
<i>Now I breathe</i>

06:58.400 --> 07:00.533
<i>Now I breathe</i>

07:02.633 --> 07:05.999
<i>I'm calm but I talk
like a waterfall</i>

07:06.200 --> 07:10.899
<i>Taking more and more
until I burst</i>

07:11.032 --> 07:14.300
<i>And then I can't live
with the aftermath</i>

07:14.433 --> 07:16.233
<i>I'm cursed</i>

07:27.266 --> 07:30.400
<i>And then I can't live
with the aftermath</i>

07:30.533 --> 07:32.965
<i>I'm cursed</i>

07:49.999 --> 07:51.200
David.

07:57.200 --> 07:58.433
David.

08:00.533 --> 08:01.799
You need to focus.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.300
David!

08:14.099 --> 08:16.965
Just a small dose of ketamine.
You'll be fine.

08:17.099 --> 08:19.200
This syringe

08:19.333 --> 08:21.765
contains 125 milligrams
of morphine.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.032
If any police
enter the building, David,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.865
nothing they do
will save your lady friend here.

08:32.765 --> 08:34.232
- David?
- I warned you!

08:34.366 --> 08:35.932
(slurring) Get out!
Get out.

08:36.065 --> 08:38.466
- Leave, get out.
- Get off my property!

08:38.600 --> 08:40.065
- Get back, get back, get back!
- Now!

08:40.200 --> 08:41.698
Okay.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.333
- You don't...
- Have to do this.

08:51.466 --> 08:54.233
No, she...

08:54.366 --> 08:57.032
She's done nothing to you.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.732
There you go again
with your reason and logic.

09:03.065 --> 09:04.200
You're not well.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.200
Do you really think
patronising me

09:06.200 --> 09:08.200
is a good way to go right now?

09:08.300 --> 09:09.732
You don't...

09:15.333 --> 09:18.266
You don't want to kill her.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.533
The colour of her lips

09:19.665 --> 09:21.865
suggests her fate
may already be sealed.

09:23.799 --> 09:26.065
You can make this alright.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.300
We can... save her.

09:29.433 --> 09:31.300
You, you can save her.

09:31.433 --> 09:34.533
Oh, fuck off,
you tiresome fucking prick!

09:34.665 --> 09:36.065
Please.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.599
Please, please, please, please.

09:37.732 --> 09:41.200
You are still
the same snivelling,

09:41.333 --> 09:45.699
whining, naval-gazing wretch
that showed up on my doorstep.

09:45.832 --> 09:48.366
You haven't even asked me
what I want.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.565
It doesn't matter.

09:52.699 --> 09:54.665
Not even
a little curious?

09:55.799 --> 09:59.433
To live with...
with so little imagination,

09:59.565 --> 10:02.300
are... are you sure your wife
didn't drown herself on purpose?

10:03.832 --> 10:08.333
Ah, there he is, he lives.

10:10.333 --> 10:11.333
What do you want?

10:13.099 --> 10:16.699
I want... you to suffer.

10:17.799 --> 10:19.166
Why?

10:19.300 --> 10:20.699
For ruining me.

10:22.266 --> 10:25.433
After everything
I have done for you.

10:25.565 --> 10:27.565
A home, a job.

10:27.699 --> 10:31.400
Endless nights listening
to your pitiful whining.

10:31.532 --> 10:35.032
I gave you back your life
and this is how you repay me?

10:35.166 --> 10:37.599
- Helping the police?
- Traitor!

10:38.499 --> 10:40.400
So, now I shall simply
restore you

10:40.532 --> 10:42.965
to the state
in which I found you.

10:43.099 --> 10:47.266
Snivelling over yet another
woman you have failed to save.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.099
Betrayal.

10:56.333 --> 10:57.765
She died, what...

10:59.099 --> 11:00.599
four or five years ago.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.233
Same time as Sally's brother.

11:05.366 --> 11:07.065
A coincidence.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.266
That's it.

11:10.233 --> 11:12.200
They were lovers, weren't they?

11:12.333 --> 11:14.732
A dalliance, nothing more.

11:14.865 --> 11:17.599
But maybe it was for her.

11:18.433 --> 11:21.999
Maybe she was dreaming
of escaping you

11:22.200 --> 11:25.099
while she was fucking
a younger man.

11:25.233 --> 11:26.433
Do not talk about my wife!

11:31.465 --> 11:33.465
I'm going to fucking kill you!

11:37.799 --> 11:39.532
Come here!

11:39.665 --> 11:42.200
Get in now! Get in here now!

11:42.300 --> 11:43.432
Move! Move!

11:43.565 --> 11:45.499
Come on! Hurry up!

12:15.665 --> 12:17.632
She's gonna be okay.

12:19.932 --> 12:22.266
Dr Maitland
made a full confession.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.300
It all started
when he caught Sally's brother

12:27.432 --> 12:28.965
having an affair with his wife.

12:31.765 --> 12:34.465
So, Sally came to town,
looking for her brother.

12:36.765 --> 12:38.632
And found out about the affair.

12:42.832 --> 12:44.266
What about Dan?

12:46.200 --> 12:49.266
Dr Maitland somehow found a way
of getting inside his head.

12:53.899 --> 12:57.732
So, it was him that was...
disposing of the bodies?

12:57.865 --> 13:00.233
Yeah, I'm not entirely sure
he even knew

13:00.365 --> 13:01.932
that what he was doing
was wrong.

13:05.032 --> 13:06.532
Will he stand trial?

13:08.599 --> 13:10.899
He'll need
a full psych evaluation.

13:13.965 --> 13:15.765
What... what about Linda?

13:17.032 --> 13:18.732
Maitland again.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.332
Covering his tracks.

13:21.965 --> 13:23.432
When you mentioned the letter,

13:23.565 --> 13:25.865
he couldn't be sure what else
Sally might have told her.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.865
Hey, don't even go there.

13:35.266 --> 13:36.765
It's not your fault, David.

13:38.499 --> 13:39.765
I wish that were true.

13:41.332 --> 13:43.865
I don't understand
why people do what they do.

13:46.432 --> 13:48.732
My job is simply
to determine the facts.

13:50.832 --> 13:52.899
But I do know
when someone's got a gift.

13:54.465 --> 13:56.899
And something tells me
you need to use yours.

15:45.665 --> 15:47.532
You need to get me another job.

15:47.665 --> 15:49.999
<i>Er, you do know
it's four in the morning?</i>

15:50.199 --> 15:53.432
You got me back into this.
You owe me.

15:59.532 --> 16:00.799
Have they, er...

16:02.065 --> 16:03.532
Have they said anything more?

16:04.732 --> 16:08.532
Hmm, they said I can leave
tomorrow or the day after.

16:10.199 --> 16:11.365
Good.

16:11.499 --> 16:12.565
Yeah.

16:14.465 --> 16:17.199
I really want to go back
to school soon.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.399
- You sure?
- Yeah.

16:21.532 --> 16:25.865
I... need things
to feel ordinary.

16:27.665 --> 16:30.465
But I'm not sure
you're ready for that.

16:34.865 --> 16:36.999
You know my favourite part
of sailing?

16:38.999 --> 16:40.499
The moment where...

16:42.465 --> 16:44.199
the boat's just drifting.

16:45.699 --> 16:47.232
Then suddenly...

16:49.032 --> 16:50.932
the sail fills...

16:52.565 --> 16:53.999
and you're moving.

16:55.999 --> 16:59.732
Sometimes you just need to go
where the wind takes you.

17:05.265 --> 17:07.199
Then that's what I'll do.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.765
Why don't you
take some time?

17:16.932 --> 17:18.199
What have you got?

17:20.199 --> 17:21.499
Okay, a favour
for a friend of mine

17:21.632 --> 17:23.199
is all I've got to offer you,

17:23.299 --> 17:25.964
if, erm... confirmation
of an accidental death

17:26.098 --> 17:27.632
isn't beneath your pay grade?

17:27.765 --> 17:29.799
I don't have a pay grade.

17:29.932 --> 17:32.765
Alright, DCI Wallace based
out of Glasgow,

17:32.899 --> 17:34.999
but he also covers
the Western Isles.

17:35.199 --> 17:37.532
Body found on the island of Runa
a couple of days ago.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.799
But his team are busy
with a train crash.

17:39.932 --> 17:41.499
He needs someone ASAP.

17:41.632 --> 17:42.832
Okay.

17:44.765 --> 17:46.899
Okay, I'll see myself out.

18:34.799 --> 18:36.265
Best to look at the horizon.

18:38.599 --> 18:39.699
It's to do with your inner ear

18:39.832 --> 18:40.965
and your eyes
seeing different things.

18:41.098 --> 18:43.098
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you, I know.

18:44.799 --> 18:46.098
Course, sorry. I...

18:47.265 --> 18:50.932
I haven't had the chance to work
with forensics before, so...

18:59.599 --> 19:00.932
Hiya, Mary love, it's me.

19:01.064 --> 19:02.199
Tickets?

19:02.299 --> 19:05.031
Erm, listen,
I'll see you tonight.

19:05.199 --> 19:06.932
I'm on my way, okay? Love you.

19:10.098 --> 19:12.098
Nearly went without you
back there, Maggie.

19:12.232 --> 19:14.365
No, you wouldn't.
My gran would kill you.

19:15.932 --> 19:19.265
Here, who's that that came
on the boat with the police?

19:20.665 --> 19:21.899
Don't know.

20:12.732 --> 20:14.832
Hello, are you the pathologist?

20:14.964 --> 20:16.064
Er, you are?

20:17.064 --> 20:19.031
Detective Andrew Brody. Retired.

20:19.165 --> 20:21.098
David Hunter,
forensic anthropologist.

20:21.232 --> 20:23.165
You found the body
and contacted DCI Wallace?

20:23.299 --> 20:26.699
Aye, I wanted my information
acted on.

20:26.832 --> 20:28.565
A small island like ours

20:28.699 --> 20:31.199
tends to get pushed to the back
of the queue, otherwise.

20:31.332 --> 20:32.899
Oh, I'm sure.

20:33.031 --> 20:34.765
You two thinking
of walking there?

20:34.898 --> 20:36.998
Best not keep Sergeant Fraser waiting.

20:37.131 --> 20:39.931
In you go, girl, up you go,
come on.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.832
- Thank you.
- Come on, girl.

21:13.365 --> 21:14.799
On you come, girl.

21:15.499 --> 21:17.265
Good. There we go.

21:17.399 --> 21:19.465
Oh, whose is the camper van?

21:20.499 --> 21:22.632
Oh, it's mine.

21:22.765 --> 21:24.098
I've been using it
to keep an eye on things

21:24.232 --> 21:26.098
since I found the body.

21:26.232 --> 21:28.998
But as far as I can tell,
nobody's been up here.

21:29.199 --> 21:30.265
- Right.
- But look,

21:30.399 --> 21:31.732
if you want me
to leave it behind,

21:31.864 --> 21:32.832
if you think you can use it?

21:32.964 --> 21:35.199
Ah, there you go,
home sweet home.

21:35.199 --> 21:36.732
What?

21:36.864 --> 21:38.199
- Right, we'll be off.
- Okay.

21:38.332 --> 21:40.064
If you need me,
you know where I am.

21:40.199 --> 21:41.365
Thank you.

22:00.031 --> 22:00.964
Okay.

22:13.031 --> 22:14.432
Jesus fuck.

22:14.565 --> 22:15.898
Oh, my God.

22:16.031 --> 22:17.199
Are you okay?

22:17.332 --> 22:18.898
Yeah, yeah, I'll be alright.

22:25.064 --> 22:26.765
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

22:26.898 --> 22:29.199
No, it's a highly unusual burn.

22:30.332 --> 22:31.798
Wallace would have
been better off

22:31.931 --> 22:33.432
getting Mulder and Scully.

22:33.565 --> 22:36.432
Windows are sealed,
no sign of water ingress.

22:36.565 --> 22:38.031
Modest risk of contamination,

22:38.199 --> 22:40.332
otherwise site integrity
remains sound.

22:42.432 --> 22:44.998
- What does that mean?
- We work here.

22:45.199 --> 22:47.365
Duncan has ambitions for CID.

22:47.499 --> 22:49.432
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, if you can,

22:49.565 --> 22:51.964
it's always best to study
a body in situ.

22:52.098 --> 22:53.199
Context is everything.

22:53.332 --> 22:54.898
Yeah, well,
context is saying

22:55.031 --> 22:58.299
that some druggie just passed
out on his fucking candle.

22:58.432 --> 23:00.831
Right, let's get working lights
set up,

23:00.964 --> 23:02.798
er, outer and inner perimeter.

23:02.931 --> 23:04.365
No, it's clearly
an accident.

23:04.499 --> 23:05.599
I mean, look at the place.

23:05.732 --> 23:09.098
Well, presumption doesn't
dictate process.

23:09.232 --> 23:11.732
And you can lose these.

23:11.864 --> 23:13.764
The DNA will have been
destroyed in the fire.

23:13.898 --> 23:15.465
- Sure.
- Okay.

23:15.599 --> 23:17.199
Thank you.

23:22.864 --> 23:25.931
<i>Given the right
temperature, everything burns.</i>

23:26.064 --> 23:29.064
<i>Wood, clothing, people.</i>

23:33.931 --> 23:36.898
<i>At 250 degrees Celsius,
flesh will ignite,</i>

23:37.031 --> 23:40.199
<i>skin blacken
and muscle contract.</i>

23:42.998 --> 23:46.199
<i>Of the soft tissue, the organs
are always the last to go.</i>

23:46.199 --> 23:47.565
<i>Cocooned in moistness,</i>

23:47.699 --> 23:49.199
<i>they will hold out
till the bitter end.</i>

23:50.199 --> 23:52.365
<i>But bone is different.</i>

23:54.199 --> 23:56.199
<i>It resists the hottest
of fires,</i>

23:56.299 --> 23:57.831
<i>often retaining
its ghostly shape</i>

23:57.964 --> 24:00.432
<i>even when all the carbon
has been burned from it.</i>

24:00.565 --> 24:02.831
<i>A final bastion stubbornly
clinging to the memories</i>

24:02.964 --> 24:04.565
<i>of a life once lived.</i>

24:23.199 --> 24:25.031
No, I have to make the bed.

24:25.199 --> 24:26.232
I'll help.

24:27.499 --> 24:29.365
You're not the kind of help
I need.

24:29.499 --> 24:31.265
I'm good with beds.

24:39.432 --> 24:41.332
Fire was highly localised

24:41.465 --> 24:44.399
and must have been intensely hot
to reduce the body to ash.

24:45.764 --> 24:47.831
Radiant heat has scorched
surrounding objects,

24:47.964 --> 24:51.532
but nearby mattress remains untouched.

24:57.599 --> 24:59.299
Hip bones too wide for a man,

24:59.432 --> 25:00.898
head of the humerus too narrow.

25:01.031 --> 25:04.031
It's cumulative.
Either one could be marginal.

25:04.199 --> 25:07.931
But together,
they suggest a female.

25:12.299 --> 25:15.499
Alright. How many fire sources
are you seeing?

25:17.599 --> 25:20.064
Okay, so we have the one
in the hearth

25:20.199 --> 25:21.631
and that smaller one,

25:21.764 --> 25:25.199
but aren't they too far
from the body to be the cause?

25:25.332 --> 25:27.465
Not so simple.

25:27.599 --> 25:29.232
No one stays still
when they catch fire,

25:29.365 --> 25:30.664
even if they're unconscious.

25:30.798 --> 25:33.465
The body's instinct is always
to save itself.

25:33.598 --> 25:37.098
Of course. Erm, well, could
an accelerant have been used?

25:38.332 --> 25:39.499
That's a good question.

25:39.631 --> 25:41.265
Erm, haven't smelt
any residual benzine

25:41.399 --> 25:44.532
and accelerants like petrol
don't burn hot enough.

25:44.664 --> 25:45.731
Plus...

25:46.698 --> 25:49.499
The fire would have spread
and the whole cottage gone up.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.199
But it's rare, surely,

25:51.199 --> 25:53.199
I mean, no, no fire damage
to the building?

25:53.332 --> 25:55.598
- It's certainly a first for me.
- Marvellous.

25:55.731 --> 26:00.031
Let's call it a day for now,
start again in the morning.

26:00.232 --> 26:02.031
If you could start sealing
the building up, please?

26:02.199 --> 26:03.299
Yeah, sure.

26:21.564 --> 26:24.199
Come on, he'll be here soon.

26:24.199 --> 26:27.931
Get a wriggle on, then.
I need five more minutes.

26:28.064 --> 26:30.064
Oh, come on.

26:30.199 --> 26:32.399
- Oi.
- Oh.

26:34.299 --> 26:35.199
No...

26:45.465 --> 26:47.399
Nice to have money
to burn.

26:48.698 --> 26:51.399
- Who lives there?
- Strachans.

26:51.531 --> 26:54.064
Came to Runa
from God knows where.

26:54.199 --> 26:56.698
Started chucking money around,

26:56.831 --> 27:00.731
fixed roads, school,
medical clinic.

27:00.864 --> 27:02.098
Isn't that good?

27:02.232 --> 27:04.898
Well, makes them think
that they own the place.

27:05.798 --> 27:08.199
<i>Officials have
confirmed that the derailment</i>

27:08.299 --> 27:11.399
<i>of a passenger train was caused
by a terrorist attack.</i>

27:11.531 --> 27:13.265
<i>- The train, which was...</i>
- Hello?

27:13.399 --> 27:14.998
<i>- ...hundreds of passengers...</i>
- Hi, Josie.

27:15.199 --> 27:17.365
- Hey, lovely, how are you doing?
- Good.

27:18.564 --> 27:21.664
- Oh, I need a drink.
- Coming up.

27:21.798 --> 27:25.199
Ta, and I've been calling Mary
all day to tell her I'm coming.

27:25.199 --> 27:27.232
And no answer, I guess?

27:27.365 --> 27:28.698
Don't suppose you've managed
to hold her down?

27:28.831 --> 27:30.465
- You'll find her in the kitchen.
- Ah.

27:30.598 --> 27:32.199
She's been better,
but she's doing okay.

27:32.199 --> 27:33.399
She's looking forward
to that holiday.

27:33.531 --> 27:34.498
That makes two of us.

27:34.631 --> 27:35.465
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:35.598 --> 27:37.498
Oh, sorry, er, Dr Hunter.

27:37.631 --> 27:39.664
"Ellen" is what she forgot
to say.

27:39.798 --> 27:41.399
I wasn't sure what time
you'd be arriving,

27:41.531 --> 27:43.299
but your room's ready,
if you want to follow me.

27:43.432 --> 27:46.098
Thank you, I'll be down.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.299
Aye.

27:59.898 --> 28:01.498
Alice.

28:02.464 --> 28:03.531
Oh, her name's Anna,

28:03.664 --> 28:05.498
and I've told her
it's past bedtime.

28:05.631 --> 28:07.399
I can't sleep.
The sea's too loud.

28:07.531 --> 28:10.265
Oh, funny how it didn't bother
you last week. Bed, young lady.

28:10.399 --> 28:12.831
I'll come to you once I've shown
Dr Hunter his room.

28:13.764 --> 28:16.631
Talking of, room's not
very grand, I'm afraid.

28:16.764 --> 28:19.365
Oh, I'm sure it's fine.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.731
Oh, always the way, oh, hey.

28:23.498 --> 28:26.564
Er, there's no Wi-Fi, so you can
plug into the phone line.

28:26.698 --> 28:28.199
There's no taxis on the island,

28:28.299 --> 28:30.431
so guests borrow my car
when needed.

28:30.564 --> 28:33.199
She's not a Porsche
but she's tough.

28:33.199 --> 28:35.498
I'm-I'm sorry about the muddle
with Anna.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.332
She's used to all kinds,
living here.

28:48.798 --> 28:50.399
<i>The Met Office</i>

28:50.531 --> 28:53.631
<i>has issued a severe weather
warning for Storm Marnie,</i>

28:53.764 --> 28:56.098
<i>which is due to hit
the west coast of Scotland</i>

28:56.232 --> 28:58.098
<i>later this evening.</i>

28:58.232 --> 29:01.498
<i>Severe flooding is expected,
and high winds are anticipated</i>

29:01.631 --> 29:04.664
<i>across most of Scotland
and northwest England.</i>

29:36.631 --> 29:38.964
That's considerably
further north than before.

29:40.364 --> 29:41.764
They're the coordinates.

29:44.898 --> 29:46.598
Four?

29:46.731 --> 29:48.232
Six.

29:48.364 --> 29:49.898
That's not what we agreed.

29:50.031 --> 29:53.464
Now, I told you from the start,
four per trip, max.

29:54.764 --> 29:56.364
So, say no.

29:59.598 --> 30:03.398
48-hour turnaround,
no different any other times.

30:04.698 --> 30:05.864
It's too big a risk.

30:10.364 --> 30:11.798
I want 30 percent.

30:14.764 --> 30:16.998
See, that is what I admire, Ian.

30:18.664 --> 30:20.998
A man who's not afraid
to speak his mind.

30:23.564 --> 30:24.898
How's that son of yours?

30:25.764 --> 30:27.064
Capable lad, I hear.

30:28.564 --> 30:32.531
If he ever fancies
broadening his horizons,

30:32.664 --> 30:34.298
be sure to let me know.

31:11.664 --> 31:12.864
<i>Hey.</i>

31:14.398 --> 31:16.064
- Hello.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

31:18.564 --> 31:22.964
Erm... the Outer Hebrides.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.664
<i>Oh.</i>

31:24.798 --> 31:26.564
An island called Runa.

31:26.698 --> 31:27.664
<i>Okay.</i>

31:27.798 --> 31:28.898
<i>I thought you were kidding.</i>

31:29.031 --> 31:30.598
No.

31:31.798 --> 31:33.664
<i>What are you doing, David?</i>

31:34.564 --> 31:35.498
Er...

31:39.998 --> 31:41.031
I'm not sure.

31:42.464 --> 31:43.864
A job.

31:43.998 --> 31:46.564
<i>Sounds like a long way
to go for a job.</i>

31:47.964 --> 31:49.698
I think the wind blew me here.

31:51.631 --> 31:52.698
You don't mind me calling?

31:55.064 --> 31:57.931
<i>No, I like hearing your voice.</i>

31:59.064 --> 32:00.764
<i>Stay safe, David.</i>

32:03.398 --> 32:04.464
And you.

32:15.198 --> 32:16.798
Made yourself at home,
Sergeant Fraser?

32:16.931 --> 32:20.331
Hey, aye, er, well, my daughter,

32:20.464 --> 32:22.698
she works here at the hotel
and Ellen's an old friend.

32:22.831 --> 32:25.198
You know, you may be right,
from what I...

32:27.931 --> 32:29.331
From what I can tell, er,

32:29.464 --> 32:31.264
the heat fractures on the skull
aren't in a grid,

32:31.398 --> 32:32.964
which means they occurred
before decomposition.

32:33.098 --> 32:34.431
If I can confirm
that it's natural,

32:34.564 --> 32:35.631
then we should be able to...

32:35.764 --> 32:37.798
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
erm, up here, Doc,

32:37.931 --> 32:40.598
when we're finished working
for the day, we're done.

32:41.998 --> 32:43.064
Okay.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.964
I'll start early tomorrow,
but I can make my own way up.

32:47.098 --> 32:48.664
Yeah, knock yourself out.

32:48.798 --> 32:51.998
- This is Duncan's.
- Oh, great, thanks, Ellen.

32:52.198 --> 32:54.864
Making the lad cook in
the camper van's a bit harsh.

32:54.998 --> 32:56.064
Even for me.

33:00.864 --> 33:01.831
Hello.

33:02.764 --> 33:03.698
How did it go?

33:05.664 --> 33:08.664
Oh, sorry, you're not meant
to tell me what you've found.

33:08.798 --> 33:10.264
It's early days.

33:10.398 --> 33:13.064
Er, we don't run to a menu,
so I hope mutton stew's alright.

33:13.198 --> 33:14.631
I've left yours at your table, Andrew.

33:14.764 --> 33:16.031
Thanks, Ellen.

33:16.198 --> 33:17.664
Would you care to join me?

33:17.798 --> 33:19.798
It's comfier than eating
at the bar.

33:22.098 --> 33:23.198
Sure.

33:30.498 --> 33:31.898
Hi, lads.

33:32.031 --> 33:33.664
- I'll get your .
- Aye, well, there you go.

33:33.798 --> 33:36.431
We don't go up
by the cottage much.

33:36.564 --> 33:39.831
Bess, she chooses her own routes
these days.

33:39.964 --> 33:41.664
She must have caught a scent.

33:41.798 --> 33:42.864
I'm sure she did.

33:46.664 --> 33:49.531
Well, it's a beautiful place
to live.

33:49.664 --> 33:52.731
Oh, these islands
are pretty enough indeed,

33:52.864 --> 33:54.064
but don't be fooled.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.798
We've had
a long-standing problem

33:55.931 --> 33:58.798
of empty properties
being used as drug dens.

33:58.931 --> 34:00.231
- Really?
- Hmm.

34:00.364 --> 34:02.398
Come over from the mainland
on the ferry.

34:02.531 --> 34:04.064
And as we've no police here,

34:04.198 --> 34:06.531
we're as near as we get
to lawless.

34:43.598 --> 34:45.563
<i>Far from being
the hard and brittle forms</i>

34:45.697 --> 34:47.498
<i>that museums might invoke,</i>

34:47.630 --> 34:50.063
<i>skeletons are a living tissue,</i>

34:50.197 --> 34:52.331
<i>malleable, responsive.</i>

34:55.664 --> 34:58.464
<i>Forever shaping,
changing, remoulding,</i>

<i>Bone records all.</i>

35:07.331 --> 35:12.198
<i>An archive of human history,
a map of the lived experience.</i>

35:25.831 --> 35:29.864
Ah, shit.

35:32.364 --> 35:35.198
Tibia and fibula
charred as far as the shins.

35:37.798 --> 35:41.864
Signs of decomposition
on remaining soft tissue.

35:41.997 --> 35:45.030
Does that mean that you can tell
when she died?

35:45.198 --> 35:47.864
Well, it's tricky with
very limited insect activity,

35:47.997 --> 35:50.764
but given the conditions,
that's what I'd expect.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.664
Surely you have some idea, gents?

35:53.798 --> 35:55.731
Mr Brody.

35:55.864 --> 35:57.498
You can't be in here.

35:57.631 --> 35:59.231
The site is closed
to the public.

35:59.364 --> 36:00.698
Oh.

36:00.831 --> 36:02.898
I didn't realise it was
an official crime scene.

36:03.030 --> 36:04.898
You are retired, remember.

36:06.798 --> 36:07.997
Come on, Bess.

36:19.997 --> 36:21.198
Is this far enough?

36:21.298 --> 36:22.798
Well...

36:22.931 --> 36:26.631
You know, I could always
stick my fingers in my ears.

36:28.198 --> 36:30.798
Feel free to stick them
wherever you want.

37:09.864 --> 37:13.198
Fireplace, one-three-two.

37:14.198 --> 37:15.198
One-three-two.

37:15.298 --> 37:17.331
- Let's do the stairs.
- Yep.

37:20.063 --> 37:23.231
Er, 27.5.

37:25.364 --> 37:26.764
So, we know it's a woman,

37:26.897 --> 37:29.731
but do we have anything more
on her?

37:29.864 --> 37:32.231
Like how long she's been dead?

37:32.364 --> 37:34.298
Well, er...

37:34.431 --> 37:36.364
Assuming she's been here
all this time,

37:36.498 --> 37:39.097
and looking at the way
the stone's scorched underneath,

37:39.231 --> 37:44.598
I would say we're looking
at around... four to five weeks.

37:44.731 --> 37:46.798
Commitment's an issue with you,
isn't it?

37:46.930 --> 37:49.030
She's 30.

37:49.198 --> 37:50.997
Erm, a couple of years younger, perhaps.

37:51.198 --> 37:52.731
How can you tell that?

37:52.863 --> 37:56.198
The female pubic bone
flattens with age,

37:56.198 --> 37:59.764
and this one's eroded,
but not badly damaged.

37:59.897 --> 38:01.930
Wait a sec.

38:16.831 --> 38:17.598
What is that?

38:20.863 --> 38:22.063
Body fat.

38:25.298 --> 38:26.963
- Sorry.
- That's it.

38:29.231 --> 38:30.564
That's it.

38:30.698 --> 38:33.331
There's two ways you can
reduce a human body to ash.

38:33.464 --> 38:35.664
You incinerate it
at a very high temperature,

38:35.798 --> 38:36.897
which we know didn't happen

38:37.030 --> 38:38.963
because the cottage
didn't burn down.

38:39.097 --> 38:41.063
Or you burn it
at a lower temperature,

38:41.198 --> 38:42.564
but for much longer.

38:43.398 --> 38:47.063
This was a low-intensity fire.
It's called the wick effect.

38:47.198 --> 38:48.897
The what?

38:49.030 --> 38:52.431
She didn't roll onto a candle.
She was the candle.

38:52.564 --> 38:55.063
Body fat the wax,
clothing the wick.

38:55.198 --> 38:58.863
Less fat towards the extremities
means the fire goes out.

38:58.997 --> 39:01.398
How the fuck is she
on the ceiling?!

39:01.531 --> 39:03.198
Fat liquifies.

39:04.231 --> 39:05.963
Gets carried up in the smoke.

39:06.097 --> 39:09.564
Like a chip pan fire
without the chips.

39:10.631 --> 39:11.997
Sorry.

39:14.331 --> 39:15.598
So, erm...

39:17.264 --> 39:21.464
Are we any closer to figuring
out if this is a crime scene?

39:23.631 --> 39:24.897
No.

39:29.863 --> 39:31.930
So, we do this right
and there's more,

39:32.063 --> 39:34.431
all proceeds to be split
between ourselves,

39:34.564 --> 39:36.897
everything free and fair.

39:38.231 --> 39:40.231
Anyone having a good enough year
to say no?

39:42.331 --> 39:44.331
So, you inviting us in
to keep us quiet?

39:44.464 --> 39:45.631
Is that it, Ian?

39:47.531 --> 39:49.264
Aye, aye.

39:52.364 --> 39:53.997
What time is it?

39:54.198 --> 39:55.863
6.30.

39:55.997 --> 39:58.963
You were already here when
I got up at 6.00 this morning.

39:59.930 --> 40:01.063
Was I?

40:03.531 --> 40:05.398
It looks like her head
just exploded.

40:05.531 --> 40:07.930
I mean, was that the heat or...?

40:08.997 --> 40:10.730
That's what they used to think.

40:10.863 --> 40:12.231
Cranial blowout.

40:12.364 --> 40:14.063
But it was nonsense.

40:18.464 --> 40:19.331
Want to feel?

40:19.464 --> 40:20.997
- Yeah.
- Careful.

40:23.264 --> 40:24.730
Heat induces fractures.

40:24.863 --> 40:28.097
Each has a different texture,
a different feel.

40:29.231 --> 40:30.331
Give it here.

40:43.298 --> 40:44.398
Shit.

40:46.298 --> 40:47.531
I can feel a depression.

40:48.631 --> 40:50.063
What is it?

40:54.863 --> 40:58.997
Concentric circular fractures

40:59.130 --> 41:01.897
caused by an impact
to the skull.

41:02.030 --> 41:05.264
In this case consistent
with interpersonal violence.

41:05.398 --> 41:07.331
So, unlawful killing?

41:07.464 --> 41:12.231
Er, in all likelihood, yes.

41:14.063 --> 41:18.697
Okay, yeah, I will call Wallace
and get the CSIs over here.

41:45.431 --> 41:47.364
You can get the fuck
out of here.

41:47.498 --> 41:49.030
Any idea who it is?

41:49.198 --> 41:50.997
Are there any suspicious
circumstances?

41:51.198 --> 41:52.897
- Leave.
- I'm just doing my job.

41:53.030 --> 41:54.264
People have a right to know.

41:54.398 --> 41:56.231
Look, no, you little shit!

41:58.398 --> 42:00.264
Can't blame a girl for trying.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.531
Lying, conniving bitch.

42:31.198 --> 42:34.231
Oh.

42:52.597 --> 42:54.498
See ya. Bye.

43:23.264 --> 43:24.697
<i>Heavy rains overnight</i>

43:24.830 --> 43:27.997
<i>and winds in excess
of 80 miles per hour</i>

43:28.198 --> 43:30.630
<i>are expected
across much of Scotland,</i>

43:30.763 --> 43:33.030
<i>with the northwest
and coastal locations</i>

43:33.198 --> 43:35.264
<i>experiencing the brunt
of the storm.</i>

43:35.398 --> 43:38.431
<i>It's expected that there will
be serious consequences</i>

43:38.563 --> 43:40.364
<i>for travel across the country,</i>

43:40.498 --> 43:43.331
<i>with road, rail, air
and ferry services</i>

43:43.464 --> 43:45.630
<i>all likely to be
severely affected.</i>

44:05.663 --> 44:06.897
Fuck.

44:13.530 --> 44:14.830
Helen!

44:27.331 --> 44:28.630
Alice.

44:34.364 --> 44:35.563
Wait, Alice!

44:37.463 --> 44:38.630
Alice.

44:39.763 --> 44:40.730
Alice!

44:48.431 --> 44:50.431
Stay, Alice!

44:55.364 --> 44:56.797
Alice!

45:08.663 --> 45:09.963
Ah!

45:15.963 --> 45:19.630
Alice!
