TV ANNOUNCER (quietly):
He approaches the green.

00:33.431 --> 00:34.591
He thinks better
of it

00:34.632 --> 00:36.793
and backs away
two steps.

00:36.834 --> 00:37.801
Three steps.

00:37.835 --> 00:38.802
Wake up, girl.

00:38.836 --> 00:40.804
You don’t want to miss
all the excitement.

00:40.838 --> 00:43.500
(quietly):
Wesley Tung
is now three inches

00:43.541 --> 00:45.702
from the putting
surface.

00:45.743 --> 00:47.142
Electrifying.

00:47.178 --> 00:50.636
Heart-pounding. That grass
was topped a few days ago,

00:50.681 --> 00:52.410
but it's still a bit thick.

00:52.450 --> 00:53.747
A terrible challenge.

00:53.784 --> 00:56.582
BILL (faintly):
Hank, help me.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.589
Help, Hank.

00:59.657 --> 01:01.625
I’m just hearing things.
Right, girl?

01:01.659 --> 01:04.628
ANNOUNCER(quietly):
This is an absolutely
crucial chip.

01:04.662 --> 01:06.994
BILL:
Please, Hank,
help Bill.

01:07.031 --> 01:08.191
Help!

01:08.232 --> 01:09.961
(exasperated sigh)

01:12.737 --> 01:13.761
Help!

01:14.405 --> 01:15.633
(sighing):
Not again.

01:15.673 --> 01:16.662
Help me, Hank!

01:16.707 --> 01:18.072
I'm trapped!

01:18.175 --> 01:20.666
(wheezing)

01:21.012 --> 01:22.502
Thanks, buddy!

01:22.546 --> 01:25.174
I was looking
for change under there,

01:25.216 --> 01:26.649
and I got stuck.

01:26.751 --> 01:29.185
I'm ordering a pizza. Hungry?

01:29.220 --> 01:35.625
No, and don't bring
it to my house.

01:37.194 --> 01:39.890
A gushing geyser
of golf greatness.

01:39.930 --> 01:41.864
Wouldn't you
agree, Hank?

01:41.899 --> 01:43.628
I forgot,
you missed it.

01:43.668 --> 01:47.331
All told, a treasury
of golden golf memories,

01:47.371 --> 01:51.865
but only for those
who actually saw
this storied golf.

01:51.909 --> 01:55.470
You officially owe me
one memorable sports moment.

01:55.513 --> 01:59.040
Dang it. Lately my scalp's
been itching like crazy.

01:59.083 --> 02:02.314
You, too? I thought my
Spider-sense was tingling

02:02.353 --> 02:04.014
to warn me of danger.

02:04.055 --> 02:06.853
Unless we both have
Spider-sense.

02:06.891 --> 02:07.858
Finally!

02:07.892 --> 02:09.860
We can talk about
something besides

02:09.894 --> 02:12.454
who ruined whose
golf-watching day.

02:12.496 --> 02:16.125
(chuckling):
My scalp is itchy, too!

02:16.167 --> 02:17.134
It's lice,
you know.

02:17.168 --> 02:18.260
What?!
No, man!

02:18.302 --> 02:19.667
There's a lady
in town

02:19.704 --> 02:22.138
who does lice treatment
for school kids.

02:22.173 --> 02:23.162
She's so pretty.

02:23.207 --> 02:26.335
So, I stuck my arms
into a big pile of hair

02:26.377 --> 02:29.346
we cut off some new recruits,
and those little critters,

02:29.380 --> 02:32.577
they just hopped
right aboard me.

02:32.616 --> 02:35.176
If any of you guys know a better
way to meet the lice lady,

02:35.219 --> 02:36.277
I'd like to hear it.

02:36.320 --> 02:37.981
You gave us all Ice,

02:38.022 --> 02:42.925
you disgusting he-freak!

02:42.960 --> 02:45.793
Uh, hi, Hank?

02:45.830 --> 02:47.627
(screaming)

02:47.665 --> 02:50.896
DALE:
Boomhauer, your bathroom
Is gorgeous.

02:50.935 --> 02:52.596
Can I bring Nancy
by tonight

02:52.636 --> 02:53.603
after dinner?

02:53.637 --> 02:55.867
Okay, everybody.
Heads in the tub.

03:00.344 --> 03:01.743
Now, according
to the label,

03:01.779 --> 03:03.542
all the lice should be dead,

03:03.581 --> 03:05.549
and our hair should be bouncy
and manageable.

03:05.583 --> 03:06.550
So, how's
everybody feel?

03:06.584 --> 03:13.353
Man, dang ol' bunkered in, man.

03:13.391 --> 03:15.359
Talkin' bout clean out now, man.

03:15.393 --> 03:19.921
I got no dang end
to this stuff, man.

03:19.964 --> 03:20.988
(screaming)

03:21.031 --> 03:23.124
Die! Die! Die!

03:23.167 --> 03:24.191
(sighs)

03:24.235 --> 03:25.259
Yup. Mm-hmm.

03:25.302 --> 03:27.395
Gih... gih... gih!

03:27.438 --> 03:28.928
(screaming)

03:28.973 --> 03:29.997
(sobbing)

03:30.040 --> 03:32.167
Pull it together,
Dale.

03:32.209 --> 03:37.511
I don’t want to have
to put the plastic cone

03:37.548 --> 03:39.641
around your neck.

03:39.683 --> 03:40.707
(sobbing)

03:40.751 --> 03:43.117
PEGGY:
Hank, Ice are nothing

03:43.154 --> 03:44.212
to be ashamed of.

03:44.255 --> 03:45.222
If it's nothing,

03:45.256 --> 03:47.224
why are you still wearing
your shower cap?

03:47.258 --> 03:49.590
Am I? No...
Why, so I am.

03:49.627 --> 03:51.595
(nervous laugh):
That is so funny.

03:51.629 --> 03:53.893
I... well, I'll just take
it off when I go outside,

03:53.931 --> 03:57.094
where it'll be easier
to... take off.

03:57.134 --> 03:59.728
That got-dang Bill.

03:59.770 --> 04:01.135
Ever since Lenore left him,

04:01.172 --> 04:03.197
I've done nothing
but cut him slack.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.468
He sleeps on my car,

04:04.508 --> 04:06.976
he's always stealing
Ladybird's squeaky toys...

04:07.011 --> 04:09.809
Remember when he kept
a chamber pot by his bed?

04:09.847 --> 04:11.576
(sighs)

04:11.615 --> 04:14.914
He keeps burying his porno
in our backyard, and he...

04:14.952 --> 04:16.920
Well, I can't put up
with it forever.

04:16.954 --> 04:17.921
It ends today.

04:17.954 --> 04:18.922
Yup.

04:18.956 --> 04:20.014
Yup.

04:20.057 --> 04:22.184
Yu-up!

04:22.226 --> 04:24.421
(sighs)

04:24.462 --> 04:26.726
Well, the lice lady's booked up
for weeks...

04:26.764 --> 04:29.562
big epidemic
at the Cub Scout jamboree.

04:29.600 --> 04:32.433
She says the only thing
we can do is shave our heads.

04:32.470 --> 04:36.531
Ding! Better idea.
As an exterminator,
I will take steps

04:36.574 --> 04:39.566
to spare us the shame
of hairlessness.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.077
(grunting)

04:41.111 --> 04:44.046
A mixture of malathion
and lindane.

04:44.081 --> 04:46.709
Fairly harmless,
according to the government,

04:46.750 --> 04:49.685
which has been squirting it
at you for most of your life.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.051
Dang it, Dale,
I don't like

04:51.088 --> 04:53.249
the whole head-shaving
thing either, but...

04:53.290 --> 04:55.815
BILL:
Yup!
Get lost, Bill!

04:55.860 --> 04:58.761
Observe.

04:58.796 --> 05:01.765
(humming)

05:01.799 --> 05:04.131
Simple enough. Huh!

05:04.168 --> 05:06.762
And... tingling.

05:06.804 --> 05:09.466
And... burning.

05:09.507 --> 05:12.908
Itching, itching... burning.

05:12.943 --> 05:15.707
And... blindness.

05:15.746 --> 05:18.476
Intense burning.

05:18.516 --> 05:24.079
Hank, get your hose.

05:24.121 --> 05:27.022
Now! Hank!

05:27.057 --> 05:28.991
I want to play
lawn games, too.

05:29.026 --> 05:32.462
But nobody wants Blll's
head on their lawn, oh, no.

05:32.496 --> 05:36.660
"Bill has lice,
he's no good."

05:36.700 --> 05:39.863
"Blibbity, blibbity bloo."

05:39.904 --> 05:41.997
I suck.

05:42.039 --> 05:44.564
Huh... you usually
get a case.

05:44.608 --> 05:48.044
That's back when I had
friends to share beer with.

05:48.078 --> 05:49.875
Can I drink here?

05:49.914 --> 05:51.905
Nope.

06:03.761 --> 06:07.390
(slurring):
Just you and me, mailbox.

06:07.431 --> 06:10.696
There you go, buddy.

06:10.734 --> 06:13.259
Uh, sir,
you can't do that.

06:13.304 --> 06:17.297
(chuckling):
Oops. I'm sorry, Fuzz... Fuzzy.

06:17.341 --> 06:19.309
All right sir,
time to come downtown.

06:19.343 --> 06:21.243
I've got a 1-4-9
on a 3-4-4.

06:21.278 --> 06:24.907
(garbled radio transmission)

06:24.949 --> 06:27.247
Did you catch
the North-side burglar?

06:27.284 --> 06:28.717
No, he's a drunk.

06:28.752 --> 06:30.720
(exasperated):
Is a 1-4-9 a burglary, Doug?

06:30.754 --> 06:32.016
You said 1-4-9?

06:32.056 --> 06:34.024
I thought you said
"I got the burglar."

06:34.058 --> 06:38.586
No, he said 1-4-9.

06:38.629 --> 06:45.467
Sorry. I'm a little drunk.

06:45.502 --> 06:47.629
I have always wanted
to use one of these.

06:47.671 --> 06:50.435
Bobby, don’t you
have something
better to do

06:50.474 --> 06:52.374
than watch this?

06:52.409 --> 06:54.969
Oh, right... like I'm supposed
to go do my homework

06:55.012 --> 06:56.980
when my dad is getting
his head shaved!

06:57.014 --> 06:59.448
Let's get this done with.

06:59.483 --> 07:02.111
It'll be one less thing
to remind me of Bill.

07:02.152 --> 07:03.119
(phone rings)

07:03.153 --> 07:05.053
Hank? Thank God you're home.

07:06.423 --> 07:08.721
Well, where the hell else
would I be?

07:08.759 --> 07:11.125
I'm sitting here getting
my head shaved, thanks to you.

07:11.228 --> 07:13.458
I'm in jail.
I fed a mailbox.

07:13.497 --> 07:16.022
I only get one phone call
and I called you...

07:16.066 --> 07:18.534
my bestest, oldest
friend in the world.

07:18.569 --> 07:20.161
You have to come
down here.

07:20.204 --> 07:21.171
(groans)

07:22.072 --> 07:22.731
No.

07:22.773 --> 07:24.673
You're my... Hank!

07:26.210 --> 07:29.077
(sobbing)

07:29.113 --> 07:32.241
(whimpers):
Oh...

07:32.282 --> 07:35.342
Nancy shaved me.
She did my armpits, too.

07:35.386 --> 07:36.944
I feel so clean.

07:36.987 --> 07:40.445
Hank! Boomhauer
and me are shaved.

07:40.491 --> 07:41.958
Are you shaved yet,
Hank?

07:41.992 --> 07:43.960
Ooh, Hank, you are going to look

07:43.994 --> 07:45.962
awfully studly
when I'm through.

07:45.996 --> 07:46.963
(sighs)

07:46.997 --> 07:47.964
Hmm?

07:47.998 --> 07:48.965
What is...!

07:48.999 --> 07:51.661
Hank! Why have you never
told me you have a tattoo?

07:51.702 --> 07:55.661
What? That's impossible.
I don't have a...

07:55.706 --> 07:56.832
I am looking right
at it!

07:56.874 --> 07:58.842
Who is she, huh?
Your first love?

07:58.876 --> 08:01.572
Some roadhouse tramp?!

08:01.612 --> 08:02.806
"Bill"?

08:02.846 --> 08:04.939
Bwaaagh!

08:08.152 --> 08:09.779
Got-dang it!

08:09.820 --> 08:11.481
How could this be here?

08:11.522 --> 08:12.614
Get off me!

08:12.656 --> 08:14.123
PEGGY:
Hank, it's a tattoo.

08:14.158 --> 08:16.558
You cannot rub it off
with a washcloth!

08:16.593 --> 08:18.288
Got-dang it!

08:18.328 --> 08:19.522
How does a man
lose track

08:19.563 --> 08:21.895
of the back
of his own head?

08:21.932 --> 08:23.593
Ugh, a tattoo?

08:23.634 --> 08:26.933
I've been lying every time
I donated blood.

08:26.970 --> 08:29.962
(muttering gibberish)

08:30.007 --> 08:31.531
(sighs)

08:31.575 --> 08:33.941
'Watsa matter, buddy?

08:33.977 --> 08:37.640
I'm the matter.

08:37.681 --> 08:39.511
I screw everything up.

08:39.549 --> 08:40.948
All my friends
are mad at me

08:40.984 --> 08:43.179
because I gave
them lice.

08:43.220 --> 08:44.812
You got lice?

08:44.855 --> 08:46.755
I also spit when I talk.

08:46.790 --> 08:48.519
And I fart when I spit.

08:48.559 --> 08:51.995
That's what makes
the world interesting.

09:01.605 --> 09:05.041
Hank? So, you're
the North-side burglar.

09:05.075 --> 09:06.406
Wait here a minute.

09:06.443 --> 09:10.072
Nancy! Will you bring
me a gun, please?

09:10.114 --> 09:11.445
Knock it off, Dale.

09:11.482 --> 09:13.450
I need to ask you
something serious.

09:13.484 --> 09:15.543
Now, can you
remember any reason

09:15.586 --> 09:18.487
why any of us might have
ever gotten a tattoo?

09:18.522 --> 09:21.082
What kind of tattoo?
Like a bar code?

09:21.125 --> 09:23.923
Because that would point
to the Rand Corporation.

09:23.961 --> 09:24.928
(groans)

09:24.962 --> 09:25.929
Good night, Dale.

09:25.963 --> 09:30.696
Mr. Hill, I have to tell you,
tattoo removal is very painful

09:30.734 --> 09:32.395
and time consuming.

09:32.436 --> 09:35.200
Are you sure you can't work
things outwith this "Bill"?

09:35.239 --> 09:36.672
I'm sure.

09:36.707 --> 09:39.039
Oh, come on, what'd he do...
forget your anniversary?

09:39.076 --> 09:41.738
Look at another guy
with a little more hair?

09:41.779 --> 09:44.475
Bill is not my...
anything.

09:44.515 --> 09:46.642
I don't even know
how it got there.

09:46.683 --> 09:49.379
I just want it off
my head now.

09:49.419 --> 09:51.944
BILL:
Sure, your fingers turn blue
from the barbicide,

09:51.989 --> 09:53.684
but that’s just part of the job.

09:53.724 --> 09:55.589
You have a job?
Sure.

09:55.626 --> 09:57.218
Gotta pay the
mortgage somehow.

09:57.261 --> 09:59.286
You got a house?

09:59.329 --> 10:01.923
Well, yeah. I got it
in the divorce.

10:01.965 --> 10:03.557
You were married?

10:03.600 --> 10:05.158
(gasping enviously)

10:05.202 --> 10:07.602
Guess we got
a nickname for you...

10:07.638 --> 10:13.634
(slurring):
"Hollywood."

10:13.677 --> 10:15.645
Well, if anyone can
explain your tattoo,

10:15.679 --> 10:16.703
it'll be Boomhauer.

10:16.747 --> 10:18.544
He figured out it was Dale

10:18.582 --> 10:20.550
who was stealing
your paper, remember?

10:20.584 --> 10:23.144
Hey, man. Little
ol' Hank. Peggy.

10:23.187 --> 10:26.179
(laughs):
Oh, man, you didn't.

10:26.223 --> 10:30.592
Find a little ol' skin
art, did ya, man?

10:30.627 --> 10:32.322
(laughing)
Dang ol' Hank.

10:32.362 --> 10:33.795
A dang ol' wild man.

10:33.831 --> 10:35.594
All right, Boomhauer.
Spill it.

10:35.632 --> 10:37.896
Tell you what, why don't
you go ahead and relax?

10:37.935 --> 10:40.597
Sit down a speck, I'm gonna
tell you a little story, man,

10:40.637 --> 10:43.572
'bout a long time ago,
in a dang ol' Arlen,
far, far, away.

10:43.607 --> 10:47.202
You know, talkin'
'bout a simpler time.

10:47.244 --> 10:49.212
You know, man,
bunch of crazy kids.

10:49.246 --> 10:52.477
No bell bottoms, dang ol"...
none of that "Disco sucks"...

10:52.516 --> 10:55.542
Talkln' bout back
In the day, man...

10:55.586 --> 10:57.781
I can't believe
Bill joined up.

10:57.821 --> 11:00.051
Every time I exercise
my freedoms,

11:00.090 --> 11:02.285
I'll think of him
protecting them.

11:02.326 --> 11:05.386
(crying):
I'll wait for you.

11:05.429 --> 11:07.397
Boy, that's
the third one today.

11:07.431 --> 11:09.729
And none of them is going
to miss him more than me.

11:09.766 --> 11:13.668
Or me.
Or, dang ol'...
dang.

11:13.704 --> 11:15.001
Look at us, all mopey.

11:15.038 --> 11:16.801
This isn't any kind of send-off

11:16.840 --> 11:18.831
for a soon-to-be
war hero.

11:18.876 --> 11:20.537
Road trip! Whoo-hoo!

11:20.577 --> 11:23.944
Big ol' D, man!
Here comes.

11:23.981 --> 11:24.948
Party!

11:24.982 --> 11:26.779
Dallas! Can we see

11:26.817 --> 11:30.218
where Lee Harvey Oswald
was framed?

11:30.254 --> 11:32.518
Well, I just hope
you fellas don't go

11:32.556 --> 11:35.116
and have too much fun
while I'm gone.

11:35.158 --> 11:37.683
We won't. This is
the last night of fun

11:37.728 --> 11:39.559
we'll have till
you get back.

11:39.596 --> 11:41.086
Now I want to be
the first one

11:41.131 --> 11:43.429
to buy the Army man
a drink.

11:43.467 --> 11:44.434
The "Chainsaw." Huh.

11:44.468 --> 11:47.164
Probably a hangout
for the lumber industry.

11:47.204 --> 11:49.035
(playing punk rock)

11:49.072 --> 11:53.236
HANK (slurring):
Look out, enemies
of America!

11:53.277 --> 11:55.108
Here comes our friend,

11:55.145 --> 11:57.443
Private First Class,
Bill Dauterive!

11:57.481 --> 11:59.745
The man! Yay!
To Bill!

11:59.783 --> 12:01.307
Dang 'ol, man.

12:01.351 --> 12:02.579
Play "The Gambler!"

12:02.619 --> 12:05.747
Come on, play "The Gambler!"

12:05.789 --> 12:12.627
♪ You got to know
when to hold 'em ♪

12:12.663 --> 12:14.426
♪ Know when to fold 'em ♪

12:14.464 --> 12:16.432
(slurring):
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.

12:16.466 --> 12:18.434
Every time I go
to the hardware store

12:18.468 --> 12:20.436
and the guy says,
"Okay, here's your bill,"

12:20.470 --> 12:22.438
I'm going to say
"No, it's not."

12:22.472 --> 12:23.439
"This is my Bill."

12:23.473 --> 12:24.440
Hey, jackass.

12:24.474 --> 12:28.342
How'd you like to
lose that finger?

12:28.378 --> 12:29.402
Whoa, whoa, there!

12:29.446 --> 12:32.381
You watch your
language around GI Bill!

12:32.416 --> 12:37.945
Take it easy, friend.

12:37.988 --> 12:40.582
Aren't we all just here to rock?

12:40.624 --> 12:43.320
(blowing raspberry)

12:43.360 --> 12:46.761
(punk rock music plays)

12:46.797 --> 12:47.764
Boomhauer!

12:47.798 --> 12:50.961
Get Hank out of here!

12:51.001 --> 12:55.062
So Bill saved my butt
and I never even thanked him.

12:55.105 --> 12:57.073
(laughs):
Oh, yes,
you did, man.

12:57.107 --> 13:01.476
♪ Bill knows when to fold 'em ♪

13:01.511 --> 13:03.502
♪ He knows when to hold 'em. ♪

13:03.547 --> 13:04.514
(Dale retching)

13:04.548 --> 13:06.709
Boomhauer, stick with Hank.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.014
It's going to be a while
with Dale.

13:09.052 --> 13:11.418
(weakly):
I had a big dinner.

13:11.455 --> 13:14.288
I tried to join up, too,
but they didn't take me...

13:14.324 --> 13:16.792
(slurring):
Narrow urethra.

13:16.827 --> 13:17.794
Bill!

13:20.664 --> 13:22.791
Hey, man,
d-dang... no, man.

13:25.635 --> 13:27.728
HANK:
Big, big letters, here to here

13:27.971 --> 13:30.838
B-l-L-L. Bill!

13:30.874 --> 13:31.932
Okay.

13:31.975 --> 13:33.533
(sighs)

13:33.577 --> 13:35.135
(moaning)

13:35.178 --> 13:36.236
(snoring)

13:36.279 --> 13:38.941
Hey, man, dang...
dang ol' passed out cold, man.

13:38.982 --> 13:40.916
L-let's d... let it go, man.

13:40.951 --> 13:44.250
I accepted his money;
he's getting his ink.

13:44.287 --> 13:45.254
(groans):
Dang it.

13:45.288 --> 13:46.255
Oh, okay, man.

13:46.289 --> 13:48.257
But let's not-not... across
the dang ol' chest, man.

13:48.291 --> 13:49.383
F-Find a d... someplace

13:49.426 --> 13:52.918
where the dang ol' sun
don’t shine, man.

13:52.963 --> 13:54.931
You know, I've been talking
about it

13:54.965 --> 13:56.933
like I thought you'd never know,
man.

13:56.967 --> 13:58.935
A dang ol' lice... threw in
that dang ol' curve-ball, man.

13:58.969 --> 14:01.403
Just like a got-dang ol'
Sandy Koufax, man.

14:01.438 --> 14:03.201
(sighs heavily)

14:03.240 --> 14:04.502
Yeah, I guess I forgot

14:04.541 --> 14:07.339
all about the Bill
that Bill used to be.

14:07.377 --> 14:08.969
I ought to kick
my own ass.

14:09.012 --> 14:10.980
You know,
the real surprise here

14:11.014 --> 14:12.345
is that those poor lice

14:12.382 --> 14:15.818
could ever have survived
off your cold, cold blood.

14:15.852 --> 14:22.416
BILL:
Mmm, Dr. Milford,
be straight with me...

14:22.459 --> 14:23.619
what have I got?

14:23.660 --> 14:26.060
(deep voice):
It's a heart murmur.

14:26.096 --> 14:27.495
Tune in tomorrow.

14:27.531 --> 14:28.429
Oh, no!

14:28.465 --> 14:29.796
Aah, what happens?!

14:29.833 --> 14:31.198
A heart murmur?!

14:31.234 --> 14:33.702
Hey, come on, fellas,
you got to be patient, now.

14:33.870 --> 14:37.670
Man, jail was a lot less
fun before you got here.

14:37.707 --> 14:38.731
William Dauterive?

14:38.775 --> 14:40.675
Time for your court appearance.

14:44.714 --> 14:46.875
William Dauterive,
$50 fine.

14:46.917 --> 14:48.544
Don't do it again.

14:48.585 --> 14:49.552
You're free to go.

14:49.586 --> 14:52.555
Pay on your way out.

14:59.362 --> 15:01.262
Excuse me, Your Honor.

15:01.298 --> 15:03.266
What if I don't pay the fine?

15:03.300 --> 15:04.426
If you can't pay,

15:04.468 --> 15:05.765
you spend two days
in jail.

15:05.802 --> 15:07.667
I'm not paying!

15:07.704 --> 15:08.671
What?

15:08.705 --> 15:09.672
Whatever.

15:09.706 --> 15:11.503
Two days in jail.

15:11.541 --> 15:12.872
Thank you.

15:12.909 --> 15:14.877
Bill, what the heck
are you doing?

15:14.911 --> 15:17.209
What do you want?

15:17.247 --> 15:18.544
Did you come to mock me?

15:18.582 --> 15:20.413
No, Bill, I came to help.

15:20.450 --> 15:21.815
Well, you're a little late.

15:21.852 --> 15:24.412
I'm hanging up on you,
like you did to me.

15:24.454 --> 15:27.787
And I might stay here longer
than two days.

15:27.824 --> 15:28.950
I'll commit another crime.

15:28.992 --> 15:31.654
Hell, I'll tell them
I'm the North-side burglar.

15:31.695 --> 15:33.026
They'll lock me up

15:33.063 --> 15:34.394
and throw away the key.

15:34.431 --> 15:35.398
That'll show you.

15:35.432 --> 15:37.400
Come on, Bill,
you're being crazy.

15:37.434 --> 15:40.403
Bailiff, escort me
home, please.

15:40.437 --> 15:41.904
Hey, I got an idea.

15:41.938 --> 15:44.133
You tell the guys
back in the cell

15:44.174 --> 15:45.573
I got electrocuted,

15:45.609 --> 15:47.577
then I'll jump out
and surprise them.

15:47.611 --> 15:49.476
Bill! Bill!
No, wait! Bill!

15:52.649 --> 15:53.946
(siren walling)

15:54.985 --> 15:58.284
Officer, I demand to see
Bill Dauterive immediately.

15:58.321 --> 16:02.052
If necessary, I'll be happy to
fill out the proper paperwork.

16:02.092 --> 16:05.061
Mr. Dauterive
is refusing to see visitors.

16:05.095 --> 16:07.222
He was quite specific.

16:07.264 --> 16:10.995
I am not leaving this station
until I get to see my friend.

16:11.034 --> 16:17.269
Uh, sir, we really don't
do threats around here.

16:17.307 --> 16:18.399
Bill! Bill!

16:18.441 --> 16:19.738
I need to talk to you!

16:19.776 --> 16:21.539
BILL:
Go away!

16:21.578 --> 16:23.978
TIM:
Yeah, go away!

16:24.014 --> 16:25.811
Who are you?

16:25.849 --> 16:28.249
TIM:
Who are you?!

16:28.285 --> 16:29.479
Now, get lost!

16:29.519 --> 16:30.543
We're busy!

16:30.587 --> 16:32.817
(men singling):
♪ There's a hole,
there's a hole ♪

16:32.856 --> 16:34.847

16:34.891 --> 16:37.223

(singling continues)

16:48.271 --> 16:49.238
Yeah, the fat one keeps saying

16:49.272 --> 16:52.833
he might be ready to cop
to those B & Es.

16:52.876 --> 16:54.537
Hey, you want your pizza?

16:54.578 --> 16:57.604
Work on him
until you get a confession.

16:57.647 --> 16:58.614
(sighs)

16:58.648 --> 17:01.708
MAN:
You know, the fat
bald guy in the T-shirt

17:01.751 --> 17:02.740
wants to confess

17:02.786 --> 17:05.117
to all those burglaries
on the North-side.

17:05.155 --> 17:06.122
Really?

17:06.156 --> 17:07.123
So, Hollywood
Dauterive

17:07.156 --> 17:09.215
wants to start doing
some hard time.

17:09.259 --> 17:10.226
(chuckling)

17:10.260 --> 17:12.228
Peggy, don't save dinner
for me tonight.

17:12.262 --> 17:13.729
I'll explain everything later.

17:13.762 --> 17:16.288
But right now,
I'm afraid I have to...

17:16.333 --> 17:18.324
break the law.

17:31.948 --> 17:37.909
(sighing)

17:59.643 --> 18:02.134
I believe I'm in violation
of the law.

18:02.178 --> 18:03.167
Go ahead

18:03.213 --> 18:04.180
and arrest me.

18:04.214 --> 18:06.444
Uh, sir, that's not
officially a law.

18:06.483 --> 18:09.680
Eh, it’s just store policy,
but I don't enforce it.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.778
I'm not even wearing shoes
back here.

18:27.771 --> 18:29.671
You scratched
the bumper sticker

18:29.706 --> 18:33.836
from my daughter's school,
jackass.

18:39.449 --> 18:42.077
Hey, brother.

18:42.118 --> 18:43.517
MAN:
Yeah, the guards
let me have

18:43.553 --> 18:45.077
a tape recorder
in here.

18:45.121 --> 18:46.554
You want to hear

18:46.589 --> 18:48.352
what your confession
would sound like,
just for fun?

18:48.391 --> 18:49.858
BILL:
Eh, I appreciate that.

18:49.893 --> 18:52.020
I just don’t want it
to sound too rehearsed.

18:52.062 --> 18:53.086
HANK:
Bill! Bill!

18:53.129 --> 18:54.528
Hey, Bill.

18:54.564 --> 18:55.531
Hank?

18:55.565 --> 18:56.793
What are you doing here?

18:56.833 --> 18:57.800
I came to help you.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.131
Don’t confess.

18:59.169 --> 19:01.831
Well, why should some criminal
get to go to jail

19:01.871 --> 19:03.168
and make me go back

19:03.206 --> 19:05.470
to my lousy life
without any friends?

19:05.508 --> 19:07.203
I'm your friend, Bill.

19:07.243 --> 19:08.210
Prove it.

19:08.244 --> 19:09.211
Prove it?

19:09.245 --> 19:11.213
I've been your friend
for 25 years.

19:11.247 --> 19:13.306
Who talked you out of buying
the houseboat?

19:13.350 --> 19:16.513
Who kept you from killing
yourself after Lenore left you?

19:16.553 --> 19:19.681
Who listens to you for hours
after you've had a nightmare?

19:19.723 --> 19:21.748
And I'm happy to do it
because we're friends.

19:21.791 --> 19:24.885
Heck, I even got myself arrested
just so I could talk to you.

19:24.928 --> 19:25.895
Huh.

19:25.929 --> 19:27.191
Yeah, and it turns out

19:27.230 --> 19:29.425
I also had your
name tattooed

19:29.466 --> 19:30.660
on the back of my head.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.328
Really?
Let me see it.

19:33.370 --> 19:34.462
Uh, actually,

19:34.504 --> 19:37.098
I just, kind of had it removed.

19:37.140 --> 19:38.801
Very painful process.

19:38.842 --> 19:41.276
Not because it wasn’t
a great tattoo. But...

19:41.311 --> 19:42.278
Guard, I want to confess!

19:42.312 --> 19:44.803
Ow, dang.

19:44.848 --> 19:49.547
Uh, sir,
do you think I could have

19:49.586 --> 19:52.214
a moment of your time?

19:52.255 --> 19:56.521
(groaning):
Gosh, that smarts.

19:56.559 --> 19:59.323
If you want, I can
frame it in barbed wire.

19:59.362 --> 20:00.852
Or snakes.

20:00.897 --> 20:04.230
(Bill humming)

20:04.267 --> 20:05.734
HANK:
Bill. Hey, Bill.

20:05.769 --> 20:09.500
Now what?

20:09.539 --> 20:12.508
You, uh...
you still got that mirror?

20:12.542 --> 20:14.703
Will you look at that?

20:14.744 --> 20:16.871
I especially like
the smiley face

20:16.913 --> 20:20.314
over the "I."

20:20.350 --> 20:23.649
Wow. That must've been
incredibly painful.

20:23.686 --> 20:25.711
Yep.

20:25.755 --> 20:30.351
Yep.

20:31.027 --> 20:33.393
Looks like you're out early
on good behavior.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.364
If good behavior
is a factor here,

20:35.398 --> 20:37.628
I cleaned the toilets
and made the beds.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.032
Sit down, baldy.

20:39.068 --> 20:42.162
Your court date's not
till noon.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.708
Well, fellas,
looks like this is it.

20:46.743 --> 20:48.802
(men groaning)

20:48.845 --> 20:50.779
I promised myself
I wasn't going to cry.
Gee, Bill.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.612
But look at me now.
Later, Hollywood.

20:53.650 --> 20:56.551
Hank, if you want,
I can get myself locked up again

20:56.586 --> 20:58.315
to keep you company
till noon.

20:58.354 --> 21:00.914
No, no. You've paid your
debt to society, Bill.

21:00.957 --> 21:02.424
Now I'll pay mine.

21:02.459 --> 21:06.327
Okay then.

21:06.362 --> 21:08.557
Okay.

21:18.508 --> 21:19.372
Uh...

21:19.409 --> 21:21.570
Mr. Dauterive,
you're free to go.

21:21.611 --> 21:23.602
Uh... that's okay.

21:23.646 --> 21:27.548
I'm waiting for a friend.

22:07.290 --> 22:08.882
(men singling):
♪ There's a hole,
there's a hole ♪

22:08.925 --> 22:10.790
♪ There's a hole
in the bottom of the sea. ♪
