00:20.257 --> 00:21.556
<i>Previously
on Doom Patrol...</i>

00:21.559 --> 00:23.093
<i>What's the Bureau
of Normalcy?</i>

00:23.094 --> 00:24.792
<i>It's a top secret
government agency</i>

00:24.795 --> 00:26.564
<i>run by a bunch of
demented zealots.</i>

00:26.597 --> 00:29.466
Welcome to your new base
of operations, Captain Trainor.

00:29.501 --> 00:31.536
I'm Agent
Charles Forsythe, DOD.

00:31.568 --> 00:32.738
<i>Who's Darren Jones?</i>

00:32.740 --> 00:34.572
<i>A couple of years
back, Darren Jones botched</i>

00:34.573 --> 00:36.640
<i>a search-and-destroy
mission on Danny.</i>

00:36.673 --> 00:37.875
<i>I killed my mom.</i>

00:37.908 --> 00:39.277
Hey, this is bullshit!

00:41.179 --> 00:43.112
Grid, authenticate footage.

00:43.146 --> 00:44.850
<i>There is this
tiny voice in my head</i>

00:44.883 --> 00:46.594
<i>that believes Mr. Nobody
when he says that...</i>

00:46.618 --> 00:48.152
You don't even
have memories.

00:48.185 --> 00:49.319
You have programming.

00:49.320 --> 00:50.553
<i>The rest of
the team can't know.</i>

00:50.554 --> 00:51.986
<i>They'll worry
I'm turning into that</i>

00:51.987 --> 00:53.756
<i>psychopath in
Jane's painting.</i>

00:53.758 --> 00:54.557
Grid went haywire.

00:54.558 --> 00:56.225
- How's Grid now?
- Turned it off.

00:56.228 --> 00:57.556
The machine's taking over.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.686
And I can't stop it.

00:58.719 --> 01:02.057
Look at my elbow.

01:02.090 --> 01:03.091
Look at my elbow.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.659
Look at my fist,
motherfucker.

01:10.331 --> 01:11.132
Vic!

01:11.133 --> 01:12.932
Hello, Victor.

01:12.933 --> 01:16.534
Welcome to the Ant Farm.

02:41.858 --> 02:44.126
...which
brings us to recent events.

02:44.158 --> 02:46.127
This botched raid, foremost.

02:46.163 --> 02:49.830
"Failure to
retrieve Agent Morris Wilson."

02:49.865 --> 02:51.800
Wilson was a defector...

02:51.832 --> 02:52.867
and a traitor.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.703
Either way,
he remains at large.

02:54.704 --> 02:57.899
Disappeared along with
this Danny the Street.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.306
I think the General
would agree

02:59.342 --> 03:01.210
we <i>are</i> starting
to question your ability

03:01.241 --> 03:03.576
to effectively execute
our priorities,

03:03.610 --> 03:05.379
Agent Jones.

03:05.413 --> 03:07.147
This Dolores Project.

03:07.181 --> 03:08.849
A long-term stakeout
and surveillance operation

03:08.850 --> 03:11.854
you initiated years ago
has cost the bureau millions.

03:11.888 --> 03:13.831
Just yesterday, one of the
men you'd assigned to it

03:13.855 --> 03:16.890
was injured. And with
nothing to show for it.

03:16.925 --> 03:21.295
Not quite nothing, sir.

03:21.330 --> 03:22.663
In the interest
of discretion,

03:22.699 --> 03:25.735
I excluded certain details
from my official report.

03:25.769 --> 03:28.371
As a matter of fact, yesterday's
operation yielded something

03:28.402 --> 03:31.552
quite... interesting.

03:40.474 --> 03:41.598
Cyborg?

03:41.599 --> 03:44.538
I acknowledge it's a...
sensitive acquisition.

03:44.569 --> 03:48.775
But the applications
are limitless.

03:48.807 --> 03:51.509
This could harm our relationship
with S.T.A.R. Labs.

03:51.544 --> 03:53.747
Not to mention
if it got out that...

03:53.778 --> 03:55.747
we'd obtained
such a well-known figure...

03:55.781 --> 03:57.651
I hear your concerns.

03:57.682 --> 03:59.419
But we've been
dependent on S.T.A.R. Labs

03:59.450 --> 04:02.288
as subcontractors
for some time.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.824
Whether we weaponize him,

04:03.855 --> 04:07.158
or we scrape the asset
for proprietary technologies,

04:07.193 --> 04:10.729
the intelligence
we gather could render this

04:10.762 --> 04:14.234
relationship redundant.

04:14.265 --> 04:15.901
It's a big risk,

04:15.935 --> 04:19.870
but with a big upshot.

04:19.904 --> 04:23.975
General?

04:24.009 --> 04:28.060
We mustn't
upset the butts.

04:31.315 --> 04:32.918
Okay, Jones.

04:32.951 --> 04:34.985
You've gotta tell us.

04:35.019 --> 04:40.019
How did your team
apprehend Cyborg?

04:41.526 --> 04:44.629
It was surprisingly easy...

04:44.630 --> 04:45.630
sir.

05:38.916 --> 05:41.153
You can't do this to me.

05:41.185 --> 05:42.786
You can't do this to me.

05:42.822 --> 05:44.555
Do you know who I am?

05:45.424 --> 05:47.661
Who my father is?

05:47.692 --> 05:49.394
He's with S.T.A.R. Labs,
Silas Stone.

05:49.427 --> 05:50.961
Automatic nanite
regrowth here.

05:50.995 --> 05:52.697
Ahh! Listen to me.

05:53.501 --> 05:55.166
No regeneration here.

05:56.249 --> 05:59.370
Well, we've confirmed
his operating system is missing.

05:59.403 --> 06:00.599
What I didn't expect is

06:00.600 --> 06:02.273
how limited
his functions would be without it.

06:02.274 --> 06:04.442
What? You don't
know shit!

06:04.475 --> 06:06.877
Get off me.

06:13.651 --> 06:18.358
<i>This</i> is
the great Cyborg?

06:23.795 --> 06:26.331
Is this what you saw
at the park?

06:26.365 --> 06:28.165
That looks older,
but yeah.

06:28.199 --> 06:30.269
What is it?

06:30.302 --> 06:31.870
The Bureau of Normalcy.

06:31.903 --> 06:35.139
The men you and Vic
fought on Danny the Street?

06:35.173 --> 06:36.675
Yeah.

06:36.709 --> 06:38.819
When the Bureau was founded at
the turn of the last century,

06:38.843 --> 06:41.512
it was called
the Bureau of Oddities.

06:41.548 --> 06:43.449
It was a secret division
of the government

06:43.483 --> 06:47.485
tasked with investigating
the odd and unusual.

06:47.519 --> 06:50.956
Sometime after World War
I, their mission changed.

06:50.988 --> 06:52.824
Their focus shifted.

06:52.858 --> 06:54.192
To containment,

06:54.225 --> 06:56.194
weaponization,

06:56.228 --> 06:57.862
and eradication.

06:57.896 --> 07:00.565
How do you know all this?

07:00.598 --> 07:03.834
Because I was
one of their assets.

07:03.867 --> 07:05.370
For years.

07:05.403 --> 07:07.305
They studied me...

07:07.338 --> 07:10.742
tortured me.

07:10.774 --> 07:14.146
Us.

07:18.016 --> 07:21.315
Larry.

07:24.122 --> 07:26.324
Where?

07:26.358 --> 07:27.995
The Ant Farm.

07:28.026 --> 07:31.028
It's the Bureau's research and
containment facility.

07:31.062 --> 07:32.197
It's top secret,

07:32.230 --> 07:33.500
deep underground,

07:33.531 --> 07:35.435
it's like Area 51 meets

07:35.466 --> 07:36.769
Dante's Inferno.

07:36.802 --> 07:39.338
So we go there,
we spring Vic loose...

07:39.370 --> 07:43.375
No. No, we don't.
We can't.

07:43.408 --> 07:46.745
There's no walking
into or out of the Ant Farm.

07:46.778 --> 07:49.714
I only ever got out
because Niles got me out.

07:49.747 --> 07:51.182
Well,
Niles is gone.

07:51.216 --> 07:53.120
Yes, but Silas isn't.

07:53.151 --> 07:55.754
He might know what to do.
He's got connections.

07:55.788 --> 07:57.355
If anyone can
get Vic out...

07:57.389 --> 07:59.891
No.

08:00.894 --> 08:03.228
Vic wouldn't want us
involving his father.

08:03.262 --> 08:04.362
He doesn't trust him.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.865
I agree. Silas is
a grade-A douchenozzle.

08:06.899 --> 08:11.002
Is it possible
this will just work itself out?

08:11.036 --> 08:12.471
Vic's not like us!

08:12.504 --> 08:14.105
He's fucking Cyborg!

08:14.139 --> 08:15.375
A real superhero.

08:15.406 --> 08:17.242
He can use
his computer thingie,

08:17.274 --> 08:19.444
bust himself free,
I don't know...

08:19.478 --> 08:21.048
send a text to Batman!

08:21.079 --> 08:26.079
Unless he doesn't
have his computer thingie.

08:26.151 --> 08:27.351
He offloaded Grid.

08:27.387 --> 08:29.353
Why?

08:29.387 --> 08:31.524
Grid was malfunctioning.

08:31.557 --> 08:32.991
Vic was struggling.

08:33.024 --> 08:35.259
Ever since Mr. Nobody
blew up his arm

08:35.293 --> 08:37.428
and we pushed the reset,

08:37.461 --> 08:42.067
his cyber-whatever
has been taking over.

08:42.068 --> 08:46.149
He's becoming
more machine.

08:47.206 --> 08:50.408
And you both knew this?

08:50.442 --> 08:52.177
Well, fuck!

08:52.211 --> 08:55.048
Vic!

08:55.081 --> 08:57.515
- We told you...
- Vic's not here.

08:57.548 --> 08:59.485
Yeah, he's on
a mission. Superhero shit.

08:59.519 --> 09:00.784
I know he's here.

09:00.785 --> 09:02.086
Now, Victor may have
locked me out,

09:02.087 --> 09:04.490
but I still receive
non-specific system alerts.

09:04.524 --> 09:06.424
Grid was compromised
12 hours ago

09:06.457 --> 09:09.927
somewhere inside
this building.

09:21.774 --> 09:23.475
What the hell's been
going on in here?

09:37.523 --> 09:40.125
- This can't be happening.
- What?

09:40.158 --> 09:41.860
It's Grid.

09:41.894 --> 09:46.130
He put his computer-thingie
in that computer-thingie?

09:46.163 --> 09:48.701
If Grid is here...

09:48.735 --> 09:52.485
where the hell
is my son?

09:54.472 --> 09:59.472
Uh, just wanna say
snitches get stitches.

10:00.044 --> 10:01.995
The Ant Farm.

10:11.222 --> 10:14.759
Let me out!

10:14.793 --> 10:16.360
You can't do this to me!

10:16.394 --> 10:19.264
Hey!

10:54.567 --> 10:55.833
Hey, buddy?

10:55.869 --> 10:59.004
You're looking
for a way out?

10:59.038 --> 11:00.273
Trying to escape?

11:03.475 --> 11:05.610
'Cause that never works.

11:05.644 --> 11:07.547
I should know.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.284
Who're you?

11:13.317 --> 11:15.152
I'm 722.

11:15.153 --> 11:16.153
722?

11:16.154 --> 11:17.423
Well, that's my name.

11:17.456 --> 11:19.256
Are you sure
that's not your room number?

11:20.326 --> 11:23.995
One and the same, bud.

11:24.028 --> 11:25.630
Hey, buddy.

11:25.663 --> 11:27.600
Don't be so sad. It's...

11:27.634 --> 11:29.433
It's not so bad
in here, really.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.971
You get three...
three squares a day,

11:32.004 --> 11:33.971
and all of them
are sandwiches.

11:34.004 --> 11:36.576
Mmm.

11:36.607 --> 11:38.809
And who
doesn't like sandwiches?

11:39.980 --> 11:42.413
Plus, you get to
serve your country.

11:42.447 --> 11:44.482
- That's good, right?
- Serve your...

11:44.515 --> 11:46.318
- Serve your country?
- Well, yeah.

11:46.351 --> 11:49.322
Well, every so often
they come and get you, and...

11:49.355 --> 11:52.191
and then you leave...

11:52.222 --> 11:53.957
Well...

11:53.991 --> 11:56.727
And then...

11:56.763 --> 12:00.298
Well, I don't know
what happens then.

12:00.332 --> 12:02.869
But usually,
when you come back, there's a...

12:02.900 --> 12:05.004
a perk waitin' for ya.

12:05.038 --> 12:08.240
I got this armchair.

12:08.274 --> 12:10.509
And a color television.

12:10.543 --> 12:12.543
I got my...
fuzzy slippers.

12:12.576 --> 12:16.149
So cozy.

12:16.182 --> 12:21.182
Exactly how long
have you been kept in here?

12:22.788 --> 12:27.787
Well, I can't recall
the exact date.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.660
You know the soap opera,
<i>Secret Hearts?</i>

12:29.696 --> 12:31.764
It was around the time...

12:31.798 --> 12:33.764
when that premiered.

12:33.798 --> 12:36.836
I think that was
in the '60s, so...

12:36.870 --> 12:39.605
Well, anyhow,
sometime after that.

12:39.639 --> 12:41.472
Or was it before that?

12:41.505 --> 12:42.505
Shit.

12:55.486 --> 12:58.490
What the hell?

13:03.495 --> 13:04.864
This doesn't make sense.

13:04.898 --> 13:06.264
What doesn't make sense?

13:06.298 --> 13:07.365
Vic.

13:07.399 --> 13:08.567
He was running diagnostics,

13:08.600 --> 13:10.403
obsessively.

13:10.434 --> 13:13.038
It's as if he thought...

13:13.072 --> 13:15.073
He was being hijacked
by his own tech?

13:15.106 --> 13:18.110
Tech that was installed
by his overbearing father?

13:18.144 --> 13:20.645
Oh, burn!

13:20.678 --> 13:22.413
Hijacked?

13:22.447 --> 13:23.548
That isn't possible.

13:23.581 --> 13:25.783
So it wasn't disobeying
Vic's commands?

13:25.817 --> 13:28.586
Something I saw happen
with my own eyes,

13:28.620 --> 13:29.721
and his...

13:29.754 --> 13:31.356
- Ninates.
- Nanites.

13:31.389 --> 13:34.893
...his nanites weren't trying to
take over his body?

13:34.894 --> 13:35.961
Not unless he was injured.

13:35.995 --> 13:38.163
The emergency protocol.

13:38.197 --> 13:39.432
The nanites...

13:39.465 --> 13:40.600
which I might remind you

13:40.631 --> 13:43.434
Victor and your robot pal
here triggered,

13:43.467 --> 13:45.370
only repair
damaged tissue.

13:45.403 --> 13:47.471
I wouldn't have
built it any other way.

13:47.505 --> 13:48.706
Vic knows that.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.643
You should've known that.

13:50.677 --> 13:54.379
Unless he thought
you wanted him that way.

13:54.413 --> 13:55.715
Full machine.

13:55.746 --> 14:00.746
I built that protocol
to save my son's life.

14:01.754 --> 14:03.855
You think I'd...

14:03.889 --> 14:05.990
Doesn't matter
what we think.

14:06.024 --> 14:08.592
You say these nanites
couldn't take over,

14:08.626 --> 14:10.596
couldn't start

14:10.629 --> 14:13.698
repairing healthy tissue.

14:13.731 --> 14:18.235
But do you know that
for sure?

14:20.538 --> 14:22.475
I took you offline.

14:22.509 --> 14:26.846
<i>Any deterioration
can and will be reversed.</i>

14:26.879 --> 14:28.246
What're you
talking about?

14:28.279 --> 14:30.398
<i>Just as the emergency
protocol's nanites</i>

14:30.399 --> 14:31.399
<i>healed your injuries,</i>

14:31.400 --> 14:33.619
<i>my system has
regenerated itself.</i>

14:33.653 --> 14:35.052
<i>I have been restored.</i>

14:35.053 --> 14:37.023
<i>I'm still working on
repairing your eye light.</i>

14:37.057 --> 14:39.024
No, no, no,
that's not possible.

14:39.057 --> 14:40.725
Nanites heal
injuries, not...

14:40.759 --> 14:44.230
<i>Your father and I
already discussed this.</i>

14:44.263 --> 14:45.264
What?

14:45.298 --> 14:47.033
<i>Your father and I
already discussed this.</i>

14:47.067 --> 14:48.432
<i>Your father
and I already discussed it.</i>

14:48.433 --> 14:50.335
<i>You should be kissing
my behind right about now...</i>

14:50.336 --> 14:52.104
<i>You're the one
who told me that I should be</i>

14:52.105 --> 14:53.370
<i>spending more time
with my friends.</i>

14:53.371 --> 14:54.739
<i>Not at the expense
of your grades.</i>

14:54.740 --> 14:55.774
<i>That's bullshit!</i>

14:58.677 --> 14:59.711
Stop.

14:59.745 --> 15:01.514
<i>That's bullshit!</i>

15:01.547 --> 15:03.081
Grid. Stop!

15:06.184 --> 15:07.596
<i>Not at the expense
of your grades.</i>

15:07.620 --> 15:10.389
<i>That's bullshit!</i>

15:10.423 --> 15:11.557
Turn it off!

15:18.462 --> 15:19.932
<i>System override.</i>

15:19.966 --> 15:22.366
<i>Rebooting.</i>

15:22.399 --> 15:23.634
<i>Rebooting.</i>

15:23.668 --> 15:26.605
<i>Rebooting.</i>

15:26.639 --> 15:30.475
I don't need to remind you
what we owe each other.

15:30.509 --> 15:34.712
So if you could just...

15:34.745 --> 15:38.515
Yes.

15:38.549 --> 15:41.821
Yes.

15:41.852 --> 15:46.802
Let me know
if you hear anything.

15:47.826 --> 15:50.062
That's the last of them.

15:50.096 --> 15:52.496
Every string
I have to pull.

15:52.529 --> 15:53.865
My contacts
on the outside,

15:53.899 --> 15:56.366
the DOD, the NSA,
none of them know anything.

15:56.400 --> 15:57.903
Or if they do...

15:57.937 --> 15:59.639
they're not telling me.

15:59.672 --> 16:02.140
Vic's been disappeared.

16:02.173 --> 16:04.708
There must be
something you can do.

16:04.744 --> 16:05.844
You know those creeps.

16:05.845 --> 16:06.979
You've worked
with those creeps.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.514
You basically are
one of those creeps.

16:08.547 --> 16:10.115
The Bureau has Cyborg.

16:10.149 --> 16:12.150
They obtained him
extra-legally.

16:12.183 --> 16:15.653
They have no reason
to engage with me.

16:15.687 --> 16:17.054
And however
they obtained him,

16:17.090 --> 16:19.524
he's far too
valuable to give up.

16:19.557 --> 16:20.793
My name,

16:20.826 --> 16:22.461
my influence

16:22.495 --> 16:24.443
mean nothing.

16:30.101 --> 16:32.471
I can't do this alone.

16:32.504 --> 16:34.005
- Uh...
- Do what?

16:34.038 --> 16:35.673
- Break in.
- In?

16:35.706 --> 16:36.908
Wait, to the Ant Farm?

16:36.942 --> 16:39.010
- With you?
- For this to work,

16:39.043 --> 16:41.779
I need you. All of you.

16:41.812 --> 16:43.682
This is a joke.

16:43.716 --> 16:46.566
You must be joking!

16:49.254 --> 16:52.890
You can't seriously
be considering this.

16:52.924 --> 16:53.924
Jane?

16:53.927 --> 16:55.159
After everything
Vic told us,

16:55.193 --> 16:56.894
you want to
trust this man

16:56.928 --> 17:01.231
with your life,
with all of our lives?

17:01.265 --> 17:03.601
Cliff?

17:03.634 --> 17:04.770
Larry.

17:04.803 --> 17:07.207
Of all the people, you...

17:07.239 --> 17:12.239
you want to go back
to Dante's Inferno?

17:12.477 --> 17:15.481
I'm losing my mind.

17:15.515 --> 17:18.650
What kind of break-in
are we talking about?

17:21.987 --> 17:23.890
I'll need to see
Niles' closets.

17:23.922 --> 17:26.025
Ah.

17:26.058 --> 17:27.794
<i>But if you're his son,</i>

17:27.826 --> 17:29.527
<i>that makes me...</i>

17:29.561 --> 17:31.330
<i>Mommy.</i>

17:31.363 --> 17:33.531
<i>Would you like me
to run another diagnostic?</i>

17:33.565 --> 17:35.267
No.

17:35.301 --> 17:37.669
<i>Would you like me
to run another diagnostic?</i>

17:37.702 --> 17:39.004
No.

17:39.005 --> 17:40.738
<i>Would you like me
to run another diagnostic?</i>

17:40.739 --> 17:42.240
You're not real.

17:42.241 --> 17:44.309
<i>Would you like me
to run another diagnostic?</i>

17:44.342 --> 17:45.544
No.

17:45.577 --> 17:46.878
Hey! He already told you

17:46.912 --> 17:50.715
he doesn't wanna run
another diagnostic.

17:50.749 --> 17:52.217
Geez.

17:52.251 --> 17:56.221
<i>My poor, sweet Kenneth.</i>

17:58.390 --> 17:59.424
722.

17:59.457 --> 18:01.827
You heard that?

18:01.861 --> 18:03.294
Well, yeah. Why?

18:03.328 --> 18:05.164
How?

18:05.198 --> 18:07.967
Hey, buddy, mind if we
talk about this later?

18:08.000 --> 18:12.950
I'm in the middle
of a show here.

18:15.874 --> 18:17.542
How are you real?

18:17.575 --> 18:19.144
How are you real?

18:19.178 --> 18:21.446
<i>Would you like me
to run another diagnostic?</i>

18:30.355 --> 18:31.390
No. Stop.

18:31.422 --> 18:33.525
You can't...

18:35.861 --> 18:37.196
Ah, God.

18:40.098 --> 18:42.601
<i>Would you like me
to run another diagnostic?</i>

18:42.634 --> 18:43.669
How are you real?

18:43.702 --> 18:45.505
Just stop!

18:45.538 --> 18:50.209
Elinore! Elinore! Elinore!
Elinore!

18:50.242 --> 18:51.609
Elinore!

18:52.878 --> 18:54.146
Like I said,

18:54.179 --> 18:56.014
he's been like this
for hours.

18:56.015 --> 18:57.150
And it's only getting worse.

18:58.617 --> 19:01.887
Are you telling me we got bupkis
from his intake procedure?

19:01.920 --> 19:03.890
Zip? Zilch?

19:03.922 --> 19:07.893
And the kid is
completely off his gourd?

19:07.926 --> 19:10.328
How are you real?

19:10.361 --> 19:11.663
Fuck!

19:34.753 --> 19:37.489
I get it.

19:37.523 --> 19:40.125
I don't wanna
go back either.

19:40.159 --> 19:42.294
But Silas has a plan.

19:42.327 --> 19:47.127
And we need to do this.
For Vic.

19:50.436 --> 19:52.804
- This it?
- Yeah, conveniently located.

19:52.837 --> 19:54.473
Ample parking.

19:54.507 --> 19:59.507
And only high-level Bureau personnel
know how to operate this thing.

20:01.113 --> 20:04.816
Larry?

20:04.851 --> 20:06.200
All good.

20:23.803 --> 20:27.207
Time to suit up.

20:33.246 --> 20:35.413
Seriously, no one
saw <i>Star Wars?</i>

20:47.759 --> 20:48.959
Hold on.

21:00.305 --> 21:02.640
Wh-wh-what the fuck?

21:10.449 --> 21:12.617
Oh, I'm gonna throw up!

21:16.255 --> 21:17.823
What is this fuckery?

21:17.856 --> 21:21.006
Almost there.

21:25.464 --> 21:28.133
<i>Maintenance
required in sector A...</i>

21:28.166 --> 21:29.234
Everybody good?

21:29.268 --> 21:30.436
Define good.

21:30.469 --> 21:33.905
<i>Maintenance required.</i>

21:33.939 --> 21:36.039
Come this way.

21:43.782 --> 21:45.784
It's okay.

21:45.817 --> 21:47.467
We're okay.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.874
What the hell
are those things?

22:09.909 --> 22:11.176
The operators.

22:11.209 --> 22:13.009
Don't stare.

22:17.009 --> 22:17.983
Freeze!

22:17.984 --> 22:19.784
What the fuck?

22:19.818 --> 22:24.055
Welcome.

22:24.089 --> 22:27.125
Glad all of you
could make it.

22:27.159 --> 22:29.127
What the f...

22:29.161 --> 22:33.231
Jane!

22:33.265 --> 22:35.133
Motherfucker!

22:35.167 --> 22:36.268
Okay, pal.

22:36.301 --> 22:41.301
If there was ever
a time to fight, it's...

22:51.249 --> 22:55.521
You have no idea
how satisfying that was.

22:55.554 --> 22:59.157
Shall I take you
to your son?

22:59.191 --> 23:00.192
What the...

23:00.226 --> 23:04.864
Judas fuck!

23:04.897 --> 23:06.465
<i>What's Niles Caulder gonna do</i>

23:06.498 --> 23:08.932
when he finds out you
surrendered all his toys to us?

23:08.933 --> 23:09.933
Haven't you heard?

23:09.934 --> 23:11.236
Niles in MIA.

23:11.269 --> 23:12.637
There's not much
he can do.

23:14.105 --> 23:16.342
Stone-cold Silas Stone.

23:16.375 --> 23:18.477
I guess you can take the
man out of the Ant Farm...

23:18.510 --> 23:19.946
Let's get
something straight.

23:19.979 --> 23:22.981
You and your ilk destroyed
what this place used to be.

23:23.015 --> 23:24.749
Trust me,

23:24.784 --> 23:27.787
- I'm out.
- Hmm.

23:27.820 --> 23:32.820
You're gonna wanna
prepare yourself.

23:33.459 --> 23:35.160
How are you real?

23:35.193 --> 23:36.561
How are you real?

23:36.594 --> 23:39.898
Victor?

23:39.931 --> 23:43.368
Dad?

23:43.402 --> 23:45.237
I thought no one
was gonna come.

23:45.270 --> 23:48.772
I'm here. I'm here.

23:54.480 --> 23:56.915
No. No, Grid, stop.

23:56.948 --> 23:58.284
What did they do to you?

23:58.317 --> 24:01.320
We didn't do anything.

24:01.353 --> 24:04.390
We found him like this.

24:04.423 --> 24:06.425
Now, Silas, I know
what you're thinking.

24:06.458 --> 24:08.428
But, no...

24:08.460 --> 24:11.896
There'll be no take-backsies
on this deal.

24:11.930 --> 24:14.065
Deal?

24:14.099 --> 24:15.599
What deal?

24:33.453 --> 24:37.356
It is an absolute pleasure to be
in your presence again, Trainor.

24:37.390 --> 24:39.391
Couldn't believe when
they said you were back.

24:39.424 --> 24:42.127
But I'll be damned.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.262
Forsythe.

24:44.296 --> 24:46.498
What've you done?

24:46.532 --> 24:48.433
So you sense it.

24:48.467 --> 24:53.467
A supernumerary
phantom limb sensation.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.241
What're you talking about?

24:56.275 --> 24:58.243
You may have
left the Ant Farm

24:58.276 --> 25:01.613
rather prematurely,
Trainor...

25:01.647 --> 25:06.647
But not in spirit.
You'll pardon the pun.

25:08.153 --> 25:10.489
You see...

25:10.522 --> 25:15.323
we never stopped
working on you.

25:26.137 --> 25:27.406
So what're you
gonna do to me?

25:27.439 --> 25:28.773
Torture?

25:28.806 --> 25:29.909
Surgery?

25:29.941 --> 25:30.943
Reprogramming?

25:30.976 --> 25:34.012
'Cause let me warn you,
I've been through a lot.

25:34.045 --> 25:35.146
A shit ton.

25:35.180 --> 25:36.548
Hive-mind Nazis,

25:36.582 --> 25:39.085
giant evil eye, whole fucking
town being swallowed up.

25:39.118 --> 25:41.420
Stabbed an alligator in two
for my daughter.

25:41.453 --> 25:42.821
So lay it on me, four-eyes.

25:42.855 --> 25:46.291
Take your best shot
'cause I don't crack!

25:46.324 --> 25:48.760
Primitive design.

25:48.794 --> 25:52.797
What?

25:52.830 --> 25:53.998
Hey, wh... Hey!

25:54.032 --> 25:55.834
Welding, subpar.

25:55.868 --> 25:57.736
Circuitry, rudimentary
at best.

25:57.770 --> 25:59.471
Limited motor function.

25:59.505 --> 26:00.706
Uh, no, no, no,

26:00.707 --> 26:01.973
you might not
realize this, dude,

26:01.974 --> 26:03.976
but I'm a functioning
human brain in a robot.

26:03.977 --> 26:05.343
How many times
have you seen that?

26:05.377 --> 26:06.746
About a dozen.

26:06.779 --> 26:09.247
The BON got pretty Looney
Tunes in the Nixon years,

26:09.281 --> 26:10.883
stuffing brains
into everything.

26:10.916 --> 26:12.584
We still have
a super sarcastic toaster

26:12.618 --> 26:14.053
that we use
on the newbies.

26:14.085 --> 26:16.788
It's fun.

26:16.821 --> 26:18.057
A toaster?

26:18.090 --> 26:20.925
Subject is recommended for the
"Scrap and Recycle" program.

26:20.959 --> 26:22.828
Recycle? Scrap?

26:22.861 --> 26:24.730
Didn't you hear me?
The alligator, the Nazis?

26:24.763 --> 26:26.932
I'm a fucking
unstoppable force!

26:26.967 --> 26:31.335
Dude, we stopped you
with a magnet.

26:34.807 --> 26:39.007
Wakey wakey,
eggs and bakey.

26:46.652 --> 26:48.821
They wanted me to
run some tests on you.

26:48.854 --> 26:51.356
Flip through a couple
of Rorschachs.

26:51.390 --> 26:56.161
Should we give it a try?

26:56.194 --> 26:57.829
What do you see?

26:57.862 --> 27:01.166
Hmm?

27:01.199 --> 27:04.650
Bitch who broke my arm.

27:07.239 --> 27:11.343
Bitch who broke my arm.

27:11.376 --> 27:13.246
And...

27:13.278 --> 27:14.413
bitch who broke my arm

27:14.446 --> 27:19.446
who's about to get
what's coming to her.

27:19.718 --> 27:24.523
You see that observation
glass over there?

27:24.556 --> 27:27.992
Paid the guy off.

27:28.026 --> 27:31.063
No witnesses.

27:31.096 --> 27:32.364
Uh-uh.

27:32.397 --> 27:34.232
Don't worry, Jane.

27:34.266 --> 27:36.334
I'm a gentleman.

27:36.368 --> 27:39.538
I promise to
take it nice...

27:39.571 --> 27:41.140
...and slow.

27:43.308 --> 27:44.876
Mmm.

27:44.909 --> 27:46.411
Oh, uh...

27:46.445 --> 27:48.680
I'm sorry,
discount Dexter.

27:48.714 --> 27:52.015
Did you say something?

28:01.727 --> 28:03.462
You can't do this.

28:03.496 --> 28:05.162
I'm more than
a machine.

28:05.163 --> 28:06.163
I'm a mind.

28:06.164 --> 28:09.000
Why do you think
they saved my brain?

28:09.034 --> 28:10.469
I'm a genius!

28:10.502 --> 28:12.103
All right, genius.

28:12.137 --> 28:13.839
- Two trains.
- Trains?

28:13.872 --> 28:16.007
Train A, traveling
70 miles per hour

28:16.008 --> 28:17.742
leaves Westford,
heading towards Eastford,

28:17.743 --> 28:19.611
which is 260 miles away.

28:19.612 --> 28:20.711
- Wait, slow down.
- Train B,

28:20.712 --> 28:22.581
traveling 60 miles
per hour,

28:22.582 --> 28:24.282
leaves Eastford,
heading towards Westford.

28:24.316 --> 28:26.049
When do the two trains meet?

28:26.050 --> 28:26.851
Uh...

28:26.852 --> 28:28.420
Now, you said two trains?

28:28.453 --> 28:30.323
Literally, high school math.

28:30.355 --> 28:32.057
I'm not
a goddamn mathematician!

28:32.092 --> 28:34.960
Oh, goddamn you,
you sick, conceited ass!

28:34.994 --> 28:38.030
Sure I look like some kind of
metal garbage Frankenstein.

28:38.063 --> 28:40.565
But I have
thoughts, desires,

28:40.599 --> 28:43.902
My head is a library
of faces and places,

28:43.936 --> 28:46.070
and shitty ad jingles
that I can't forget.

28:46.104 --> 28:47.506
I am a soul.

28:47.539 --> 28:50.943
A mind. A person!

28:50.976 --> 28:53.211
Frankenstein's the name
of the scientist,

28:53.244 --> 28:56.015
not the monster.

28:56.047 --> 28:57.950
Dipshit.

28:57.983 --> 29:02.983
One walking,
talking, human dirty bomb.

29:03.488 --> 29:05.490
You're the tool and energy

29:05.525 --> 29:08.827
with power to
transcend space and time.

29:08.861 --> 29:12.611
One asset split into two.

29:13.900 --> 29:17.799
Think of the applications.

29:19.270 --> 29:20.806
This being of energy

29:20.839 --> 29:23.241
should be a feather
in the agency's cap

29:23.275 --> 29:26.145
for decades to come.

29:26.178 --> 29:30.148
And you, with your
radioactive properties,

29:30.181 --> 29:34.486
should serve us well.

29:34.519 --> 29:37.789
Although, at this stage,

29:37.823 --> 29:42.260
your survival is
a little more...

29:42.294 --> 29:44.544
"wait and see."

29:48.299 --> 29:49.801
You traded them?

29:49.835 --> 29:51.969
Why would you do that?

29:52.003 --> 29:53.338
I had to.

29:53.371 --> 29:55.273
You're a monster.

29:55.307 --> 29:58.544
You are all that I have!

29:58.577 --> 30:00.512
Everything seems
wrong right now,

30:00.545 --> 30:01.814
but I promise you,

30:01.847 --> 30:05.150
it will all work out.

30:05.183 --> 30:07.285
It will...

30:07.319 --> 30:08.519
be okay.

30:16.829 --> 30:20.732
So, we're getting captured.

30:20.766 --> 30:22.167
On purpose.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.236
And tortured, right?

30:24.270 --> 30:26.972
Chances are these psychofucks
will want to take us apart.

30:27.006 --> 30:28.707
There will be torture.

30:28.740 --> 30:29.775
Physical,

30:29.808 --> 30:31.210
psychological.

30:31.243 --> 30:34.412
So captured and
tortured. Great plan.

30:34.446 --> 30:35.948
It's a big ask.

30:35.981 --> 30:37.950
- But...
- It's the only way.

30:37.983 --> 30:39.785
You expect them

30:39.818 --> 30:42.320
to trust this insane plan,

30:42.354 --> 30:44.088
to trust you?

30:44.089 --> 30:46.391
The only thing
we know about the Ant Farm

30:46.392 --> 30:48.194
is that they're impenetrable
and vicious.

30:48.227 --> 30:49.962
We already know
they want Larry.

30:49.996 --> 30:51.698
Rita, that's the point.

30:51.730 --> 30:53.765
Let's say...

30:53.799 --> 30:54.967
...you get them in,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.871
and this ridiculous plan
somehow works out.

30:57.903 --> 31:01.974
How do you
rescue <i>them?</i>

31:02.007 --> 31:04.643
Actually, Miss Farr...

31:04.676 --> 31:07.246
that's where
you come in.

31:07.278 --> 31:11.316
You're the linchpin.

31:11.349 --> 31:13.053
Okay, Rita. Showtime.

31:13.085 --> 31:15.950
Oh, thank God.

31:15.951 --> 31:17.959
Get me the hell out of here.

31:17.960 --> 31:19.558
I can't take it anymore.

31:19.592 --> 31:21.493
Ugh. Ew.

31:21.526 --> 31:23.361
Ew. Ew!

31:23.395 --> 31:24.696
Ew.

31:24.730 --> 31:27.166
Ew.

31:27.199 --> 31:29.169
Cliff, that was excruciating!

31:29.201 --> 31:32.671
Your insides smell like
an old, greasy oil drum.

31:32.704 --> 31:34.039
Hey, that wasn't me!

31:34.073 --> 31:36.375
It was the rat that was
running around inside me.

31:36.409 --> 31:38.810
I told Vic to
put an air freshener in there.

31:38.844 --> 31:42.113
Ugh. Just
avert your eyes.

31:42.146 --> 31:43.314
No peeping!

31:43.348 --> 31:46.051
What? Oh, sure.

31:46.085 --> 31:48.053
- You don't use a moisturizer, do you?
- Cliff!

31:48.087 --> 31:49.622
All right, all right.

31:49.655 --> 31:53.490
Just hurry up before the stupid
know-it-all scientist gets back.

31:53.491 --> 31:54.459
Little witch.

31:54.460 --> 31:57.096
Rita! Get me down,
we gotta find the others.

31:57.130 --> 32:00.866
Making you feel small
and stupid and useless.

32:00.900 --> 32:04.636
You're not useless!

32:04.669 --> 32:07.505
Hi.

32:07.539 --> 32:10.575
Uh...

32:13.678 --> 32:14.780

32:14.813 --> 32:17.217

It's the generals.

Hey!

- What's going on?
- You can't leave us in here!

34:54.172 --> 34:55.940
Victor, listen to me.

34:55.974 --> 34:58.378
There's a plan.

34:58.409 --> 35:00.746
Your friends are
getting free,

35:00.780 --> 35:03.614
but you're the last piece.

35:03.648 --> 35:05.717
We need your help

35:05.751 --> 35:09.800
to get out
of the Ant Farm.

35:11.556 --> 35:13.458
<i>You were
supposed to stay put.</i>

35:13.492 --> 35:15.793
You all stay put,

Let's just concentrate
on finding Larry.

35:24.235 --> 35:27.139
This is exactly what we
were concerned about!

35:27.172 --> 35:28.885
You promised us that
everything was under control.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.378
<i>I assure you,
everything is under control.</i>

35:34.646 --> 35:36.782
Larry!

35:36.815 --> 35:41.119
Cliff.

35:41.152 --> 35:42.621
Are you okay?

35:42.655 --> 35:43.722
I don't know.

35:43.755 --> 35:47.655
Come on,
let's go.

35:51.898 --> 35:53.732
Is that...

35:53.733 --> 35:54.733
Yeah.

36:01.907 --> 36:04.775
You're coming with me, pal.

36:04.809 --> 36:06.143
How do we find Vic?

36:06.177 --> 36:08.545
The high-priority wing.
This way.

36:08.581 --> 36:09.715
Wait.

36:09.748 --> 36:12.952
What about the rest?

36:12.985 --> 36:14.954
There could be
hundreds of 'em.

36:14.985 --> 36:17.222
Weirdos like us.

36:17.255 --> 36:21.005
We can't just leave them.

37:12.880 --> 37:15.981
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
- God damn it. You again?

37:16.014 --> 37:19.784
Big mess you made
here today.

37:19.818 --> 37:21.920
Rita Farr.

37:24.023 --> 37:27.427
My wife was a big fan
of your movies.

37:27.458 --> 37:29.860
Threw a dinner party once,
'50s theme.

37:29.896 --> 37:32.898
Your movies were
the inspiration.

37:32.931 --> 37:34.867
Home-cooked meal,

37:34.900 --> 37:36.668
perfectly set table.

37:36.702 --> 37:37.835
Well,

37:37.869 --> 37:40.739
almost perfectly set.

37:40.773 --> 37:42.873
The chinaware was all there.

37:42.909 --> 37:44.409
But there was a fork,

37:44.443 --> 37:48.280
one mismatched abomination
with a plastic handle.

37:48.313 --> 37:50.916
The only one of its kind
at the whole table.

37:50.949 --> 37:53.284
So I took that fork,

37:53.318 --> 37:56.487
and I jammed it
in her eye.

37:56.523 --> 38:00.871
Over and over
and over again.

38:03.429 --> 38:05.364
If we can't protect
what's normal in this world,

38:05.398 --> 38:08.300
then what're we left with?

38:08.333 --> 38:10.235
You sick fuck!

38:11.771 --> 38:12.771
They're loose!

38:15.940 --> 38:18.177

38:52.043 --> 38:54.813

38:59.217 --> 39:01.286
- Yes.
<i>- General, sir.</i>

39:01.320 --> 39:02.688
<i>The butts are loose.</i>

39:02.719 --> 39:04.856

39:04.889 --> 39:08.327

Gentlemen,

39:24.209 --> 39:28.112

39:30.215 --> 39:33.217

Vic.

39:34.187 --> 39:35.253
What the hell is that?

39:35.286 --> 39:36.456
It's Grid.

39:36.487 --> 39:38.525
- Grid?
- We need Cyborg.

40:37.684 --> 40:41.853
<i>Vic could become fully
cybernetic, all machine.</i>

40:41.887 --> 40:43.856
<i>There would be
nothing left of your son.</i>

40:47.327 --> 40:51.226
<i>Your point?</i>

40:55.199 --> 40:56.199
Vic?

41:32.304 --> 41:35.474
You did it, Vic.

41:35.507 --> 41:38.409
What a masterpiece!

41:38.443 --> 41:41.146
I mean, forget Black Box,
let's take this straight

41:41.179 --> 41:42.215
to Broadway.

41:44.014 --> 41:46.251
The stunning conclusion

41:46.284 --> 41:48.420
of Cyborg's origin story.

41:52.157 --> 41:54.958
- What did you do?
- Me?

41:54.994 --> 41:56.527
You punched him.

41:56.563 --> 41:58.965
No, no, this was
all you, Victor.

41:58.998 --> 42:01.867
Sure, Silas put
the reset button in,

42:01.900 --> 42:03.135
Cliff pressed it,

42:03.168 --> 42:05.737
but it was
your squishy brain

42:05.771 --> 42:08.806
that took the wheel from there.
I mean, come on.

42:08.842 --> 42:12.878
Grid taunting you
with videos of your father

42:12.911 --> 42:14.179
saying the exact,

42:14.213 --> 42:16.949
on-the-nose, worst
possible things

42:16.983 --> 42:19.085
you could imagine.
The last one wasn't even real.

42:19.119 --> 42:22.021
That was a Mr. Nobody
straight-to-video special.

42:22.052 --> 42:23.322
You're welcome.

42:23.356 --> 42:25.190
Vic, you bought it!

42:26.324 --> 42:27.492
You know...

42:27.525 --> 42:29.262
I told you...

42:29.293 --> 42:30.697
when we first met,

42:30.728 --> 42:33.032
don't come looking for me!

42:33.063 --> 42:34.833
But you shiny, glossy,

42:34.867 --> 42:37.735
front-page superheroes,
you're all alike.

42:37.771 --> 42:39.204
You can't wait
to prove yourself.

42:39.237 --> 42:40.639
You can't wait
to get the bad guy.

42:40.672 --> 42:43.108
Well, look what you've done.

42:50.315 --> 42:53.251
No.

42:53.284 --> 42:55.085
Dad.

42:55.121 --> 42:58.690
Dad, Dad, Dad.

42:58.724 --> 43:01.327
It's so sad, you know?

43:01.360 --> 43:03.563
I mean, you do know,
don't you?

43:03.594 --> 43:05.697
Deep behind the brambles
of all of that

43:05.731 --> 43:08.668
depressing negative
self talk,

43:08.699 --> 43:13.204
dear Silas Stone
really loved his son.

43:13.237 --> 43:18.039
He only wanted
the best for you.

43:18.976 --> 43:21.679
Whoops.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.168
Dad.

43:43.202 --> 43:45.469
Daddy, wake up.

43:45.505 --> 43:50.141
Dad... Dad.

43:51.305 --> 43:57.265
