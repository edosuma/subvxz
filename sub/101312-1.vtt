WEBVTT

01:24.918 --> 01:27.375
We're back from the hunt.
Tell the butcher.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.220
Sort out those horns
and put them on the table.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.851
And get the blood off these horns.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.806
You know the dogs
will smell them at customs.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.267
- They've got to be clean.
- You got it, boss.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.227
- Ah, this side is messy.
- Yep.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.571
Got the kill shot...

01:56.658 --> 01:59.775
Oh, yeah, messy. Head, claws, and hide?

01:59.870 --> 02:01.986
- Same, same.
- Got it.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.661
- Now.
- Another hunt later?

02:03.749 --> 02:06.491
Some Americans in an hour.
So which one do you want?

02:07.753 --> 02:09.960
Uh, boss, which one do you want?

02:10.047 --> 02:11.127
Mm...

02:14.843 --> 02:16.549
They want a male, so, uh...

02:17.679 --> 02:18.714
This one, number seven.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.884
Time's up, Donnie.

02:21.975 --> 02:25.012
Oh, yeah.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.289
Gonna run out if this keeps up.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.849
Ah, so what? We can get more.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.270
- Hmm.
- Business is good.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.189
We can get more, right, boss?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.983
Oh, yeah.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.686
Put it on the flame, boys.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.596
These are ready for shipping.
Put them with the others.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.860
Ready.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.208
Move, move. Go.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.581
Come on. Quick, quick! Pull!

02:56.677 --> 02:57.904
- She's heavy.
- Pull.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.338
Send another. Come on, come on.

02:59.429 --> 03:02.387
Move! Come on!

03:03.975 --> 03:05.055
Get up!

03:07.312 --> 03:08.768
Get down!

03:08.855 --> 03:10.220
She's in.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.324
- Got it, boss.
- That's it.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.477
Right there. Keep to it.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.527
Keep still. Pull it up.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.495
She's down!

03:27.582 --> 03:29.322
Jj

03:31.336 --> 03:32.746
Come on, move!

03:38.552 --> 03:40.463
Hey, hey! I don't think she's dead!

03:42.264 --> 03:43.584
Get out of there! She's not dead.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.148
What the fuck is going on in there?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.272
I've told you both before, don't...

04:08.081 --> 04:10.072
Jj

04:21.136 --> 04:23.127
Jj

04:36.943 --> 04:38.353
Hey.

04:39.863 --> 04:40.863
Hey, come on.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.442
- Where are the rhino horns?
- Here.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.026
And the ivory you asked for.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.531
Where are the rhino horns?

04:49.623 --> 04:51.343
There's no rhinos.
You killed them all, man.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.953
How many guards are inside?

04:59.341 --> 05:00.797
At least four.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.672
Rogue one for rogue two. Send sitrep.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.340
Good to go, boss.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.060
Stand by.

05:15.899 --> 05:16.934
Copy you.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.524
Standing by.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.490
Just a quick job, she said.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.241
Just a snatch and grab, she said.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.163
What do you want?

05:34.251 --> 05:36.537
I wanna get paid and get out of here.
I got places to be.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.414
Oh, you owe money again, Joey?

05:38.505 --> 05:42.748
So it's a girl this time, huh? Or a boy.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.835
Ii don't judge. I don't judge.

05:47.931 --> 05:51.094
Your fireworks are ready and set.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.424
How you wanna do this?

05:53.478 --> 05:55.844
Sunset's in an hour.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.351
I say we sit tight and then... boom!

06:00.318 --> 06:03.560
Why does everything always have to be
so noisy around you?

06:03.655 --> 06:05.987
You know, a girl's gotta make an entrance.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.066
Hm? Hm? Hm?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.783
Be aware that the asset
is in the green hut.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.368
Green hut. Solid copy.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.919
J am I original j

06:22.007 --> 06:23.087
j yeah j

06:23.174 --> 06:25.335
j am I the only one? J

06:25.427 --> 06:27.133
j yeah j

06:27.220 --> 06:29.586
j am I sexual? J

06:29.681 --> 06:31.512
why do you like that song so much?

06:31.600 --> 06:34.683
I don't, it's a fucking earwig. I hate it.

06:34.769 --> 06:37.511
But it keeps me awake
when I'm hanging out with you.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.062
You have a beautiful singing voice.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.658
You need to read this, boss.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.332
Shit!

06:57.334 --> 06:59.746
Okay, we go now.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.497
What now? What happened to dark?

07:01.588 --> 07:04.000
There's no time. They're moving the asset.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.921
Pata, are you sure about this building?

07:09.012 --> 07:10.012
I think so.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.005
You think so, or you know so?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.930
The difference can mean all of our lives.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.633
That is what my contact told me.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.442
Ahem.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.236
Mm...

07:33.119 --> 07:34.234
I love this bit.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.138
Water!

07:54.474 --> 07:56.010
Get the water!

07:57.102 --> 07:59.559
Get the water! Water!

08:05.652 --> 08:08.689
Get ammo! Get the fucking ammo!

08:12.784 --> 08:15.400
Quickly. Come on, move!

08:15.495 --> 08:17.326
Who the fuck did these smokers?

08:21.876 --> 08:23.832
Stop fucking up!

08:25.672 --> 08:26.712
Come on! Come on!

08:31.428 --> 08:32.918
Put the fire out!

08:41.895 --> 08:43.602
Okay, on three.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.143
On three, or three, two, one, go?

08:46.234 --> 08:47.519
Elijah, every time?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.644
- It's funny. Every time.
- Come on.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.525
Three, two, one.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.357
Jj

08:55.452 --> 08:57.317
- Shit!
- Shit!

08:57.412 --> 08:59.778
Wrong building. There's nothing here.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.706
What the fuck? Pata, this is not
how you fucking make amends.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.453
They told me it's this building.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.730
What do you want us to do, boss?

09:05.754 --> 09:07.039
It's gotta be that one, right?

09:09.215 --> 09:11.080
It's gotta be.

09:11.176 --> 09:12.656
That's a lot of open ground to clear.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.545
Rogue two, I'm gonna need you
to draw their fire.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.674
Send again, boss.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.535
You got to piss them off
so bad they shoot at you.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.675
- Copy?
- Solid fucking copy.

09:21.770 --> 09:25.479
- You know this is stupid, right?
- Yeah. We do stupid very well.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.055
Yes, we fucking do!

09:28.777 --> 09:29.777
What the fuck?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.311
Shit!

09:35.116 --> 09:36.356
What the fuck's going on?

09:36.451 --> 09:38.282
Give me the gun!
Give me the gun!

09:39.954 --> 09:40.818
Come here!

09:40.914 --> 09:42.996
Ding dong! Fuck you!

09:43.083 --> 09:44.083
Moving!

09:44.125 --> 09:46.741
- It's very painful.
- Good.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.372
Boss, this could get messy.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.380
I like messy.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.140
Yeah, we got 'em,
we got 'em up here, boss.

10:01.559 --> 10:02.912
- On three.
- On three or three, two, one?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.927
- Elijah!
- Go!

10:09.692 --> 10:10.692
Clear!

10:11.861 --> 10:13.442
Clear!

10:15.448 --> 10:16.904
Put the fucking guns down.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.071
Who's guarding the girls?

10:18.159 --> 10:21.026
Over here! Come here!

10:21.121 --> 10:22.907
You're fucking missing them, man!

10:22.997 --> 10:24.237
- Shoot him!
- Cover me!

10:24.290 --> 10:25.290
Moving, moving!

10:29.879 --> 10:32.461
Shoot him!

10:32.549 --> 10:33.669
Shoot the bad guys!

10:33.758 --> 10:35.965
Shoot them so I don't have to!

10:39.139 --> 10:40.174
Fuck!

10:41.808 --> 10:43.969
- Over here!
- Over... hey!

10:45.979 --> 10:47.640
You wanna take what's mine, yeah?

10:49.107 --> 10:51.473
Hey! Hey! Over here!

10:51.568 --> 10:53.104
Well, we'll see about that.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.113
- Yes!
- Fuck, what is this?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.366
They're trafficking girls.

11:01.452 --> 11:02.888
Please! Please! Please! Please!

11:02.912 --> 11:04.197
We'll help you, don't worry.

11:04.289 --> 11:05.641
Open the door!
You can open the door!

11:05.665 --> 11:07.747
- You can open the door! Please!
- No, not you.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.618
Hey, girl! Girl!

11:11.713 --> 11:13.920
- What's your name?
- Asilia Wilson.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.376
Bingo! She's the money.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.136
Light them up, boys!

11:32.150 --> 11:33.811
No, get back!

11:33.902 --> 11:36.018
- Get down! Secure her.
- She said don't move.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.569
Rogue one to rogue three,
we're ready for extraction.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.656
Copy you. Inbound.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.470
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about the others?

11:43.494 --> 11:45.530
- They're not part of the plan.
- Sam!

11:45.622 --> 11:47.600
You just said we gotta move.
That'll just slow us down.

11:47.624 --> 11:48.893
We don't have room in the vehicles.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.407
- Rogue one for rogue three.
- Sam!

11:50.501 --> 11:53.208
Hey! Fucking don't make me
pull rank on you, Eli!

11:53.296 --> 11:55.082
This is not about rank.

11:55.173 --> 11:57.276
We didn't fucking plan for this!
We're not getting paid for this!

11:57.300 --> 11:58.300
- Come on!
- Sam!

11:58.384 --> 11:59.794
We're not getting paid for this.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.422
Please, somebody!
Just help me! Please!

12:01.512 --> 12:02.512
What the fuck?!

12:03.681 --> 12:07.515
Please! Please! Please!
Please! I'm begging you!

12:07.602 --> 12:10.372
If I fucking die because I'm doing
the right thing, I'm gonna be so pissed.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.307
Fuck it, do it!

12:20.031 --> 12:21.271
Light 'em up!

12:21.366 --> 12:23.197
- Get me a motor car!
- Hey, over here!

12:25.536 --> 12:27.902
When you want them to shoot,
they don't shoot.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.034
Go! Gol

12:32.043 --> 12:34.034
burn these fuckers up! Go!

12:34.128 --> 12:37.211
Burn these fuckers to death!
Get in there!

12:40.468 --> 12:44.086
Well, we ain't leaving this fucking way!
We need a back door!

12:44.180 --> 12:47.297
Everybody duck! Pull back! Stay down!

12:47.392 --> 12:49.178
They set the building on fire!

12:49.269 --> 12:51.009
They're fuckin' holding. Sit down!

12:52.397 --> 12:54.012
Sixty seconds out. Where are you?

12:55.900 --> 12:59.188
We're fucked! We're fucked! We're all
gonna burn! What kind of rescue is this?

12:59.279 --> 13:01.736
Nobody fucking sent anybody
to rescue you.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.281
Seconds away. Where do you want us?

13:05.368 --> 13:09.361
Second building. Low bungalow,
south side. Back door.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.616
There's no back door in building two!

13:11.708 --> 13:12.868
There will be.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.333
- Move!
- Listen to me, come here!

13:16.421 --> 13:18.332
Come here now!

13:18.423 --> 13:20.288
Shh, it's gonna
be okay. All right?

13:20.383 --> 13:21.986
I want you to cover your ears
and open your mouth.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.125
- What? Why? Why?
- Hey!

13:23.219 --> 13:25.364
Unless you wanna blow out your lungs
and your fucking eardrums,

13:25.388 --> 13:26.798
you're gonna do what I say.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.075
You're gonna blow up the room?

13:28.099 --> 13:30.636
No, just the wall. Get down.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.054
Fire in the hole!

13:41.362 --> 13:44.104
Go around the back! Around the back!

13:45.533 --> 13:47.219
Come on! Hurry, hurry!
Get in, get in!

13:47.243 --> 13:49.780
I thought there was only one hostage!

13:49.871 --> 13:52.578
It's an evolving situation. Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

13:52.665 --> 13:54.075
How many we got?

13:54.167 --> 13:56.328
It's a "rescue one, get three" kinda deal.

13:56.419 --> 13:57.771
Let's get the fuck outta here!

13:57.795 --> 13:59.376
Go, go, Bobbie! Go, go, go, go, go!

14:00.381 --> 14:02.713
Hey! You, man. Come!

14:02.800 --> 14:04.131
Go get the truck!

14:05.762 --> 14:06.882
Come on! Let's go, let's go!

14:07.847 --> 14:09.929
Don't go, my legs are shorter than you!

14:16.939 --> 14:19.931
Let's go! Let's go!
Open that fucking gate!

14:21.486 --> 14:23.442
- Come on!
- Get in! Get in! Get in!

14:23.529 --> 14:25.110
Light 'em up!

14:36.084 --> 14:37.494
Someone order an uber?

14:40.505 --> 14:41.995
- Too soon?
- Yeah.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.626
Rogue one for osprey. Over.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.276
Go for osprey. Sitrep.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.799
We've got the package plus two,

14:46.886 --> 14:48.530
and we're three minutes
from the extraction point.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.294
I repeat, three minutes. Over.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.150
Unit copy.
Three minutes to extraction.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.094
Boss! Theyre sending more!

14:58.189 --> 15:00.430
- We need to lose these guys!
- I'monit! I'm on it!

15:00.525 --> 15:01.525
Hold on!

15:08.950 --> 15:09.950
Take stuff from me, eh?

15:14.372 --> 15:16.158
Company, company, company!

15:17.166 --> 15:18.747
I'm coming for you!

15:18.835 --> 15:20.621
They're shooting on the left!

15:25.883 --> 15:27.123
Come on!

15:29.595 --> 15:31.176
I got osprey!

15:31.264 --> 15:33.264
- Chopper's up! Chopper's up!
- Yes!

15:36.561 --> 15:38.392
Give me the rpg! Quick! Quick!

15:38.479 --> 15:39.844
Give me the rpg!

15:40.982 --> 15:41.982
Give me it!

15:43.359 --> 15:44.359
Fuck!

15:46.863 --> 15:48.728
- Rpg!
- Take him out! Take him out!

15:48.823 --> 15:50.529
I've got him! I've got him!

15:52.285 --> 15:53.445
I don't got him!

15:53.536 --> 15:54.946
Oh... shit!

15:55.037 --> 15:56.306
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Osprey, rpg fired!

15:56.330 --> 15:58.036
Pull up! Pull up, osprey!

16:06.716 --> 16:08.047
Fuck! Fuck!

16:11.012 --> 16:12.377
Fuck you!

16:20.354 --> 16:22.436
Open fire, open fire!
To the left! To the left!

16:22.523 --> 16:23.523
Stick with me.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.739
Don't worry. It's not that bad.
It's gonna be...

16:32.074 --> 16:34.736
Let me see. Oh, yeah, they shot him.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.326
Joey! Calm her the fuck down!

16:44.420 --> 16:46.706
- Hey! What's your name?
- Chloe.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.317
Chloe? Chloe, that's a beautiful name.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.611
Now look, I know you're scared,
and I know you're frightened,

16:50.635 --> 16:51.904
but you need to calm down for all of us.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.795
The cavalry's, uh...
Well, the cavalry's gonna come back.

16:55.806 --> 16:56.841
Shut up.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.185
Bobbie!

17:05.775 --> 17:07.935
Elijah! Take over!

17:08.027 --> 17:10.439
- Fuck!
- Let me control it! I got this!

17:10.530 --> 17:12.316
Keep firing! Just keep them off us!

17:13.950 --> 17:16.281
Jj

17:16.368 --> 17:18.233
Keep firing!

17:21.707 --> 17:22.867
(Grenade out!

17:28.798 --> 17:29.878
(Grenade out!

17:32.468 --> 17:34.174
(Grenade out!

17:39.267 --> 17:42.634
- Joey, grenade! It's hot.
- Thank you.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.348
See you later, assholes!

17:50.361 --> 17:52.272
These wheels are done. Fuck!

17:53.281 --> 17:54.817
All right, we gotta move.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.635
- Out! Out! Out!
- Move, move, move!

18:00.871 --> 18:01.951
Come with me. Come with me.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.044
Cover me!

18:11.132 --> 18:15.125
- Moving!
- Move! Covering! Covering!

18:16.137 --> 18:17.377
Michael, you good?

18:18.889 --> 18:20.629
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Down! Down, down.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.390
Ah, shit!

18:23.477 --> 18:25.934
It's hot.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.512
- Incoming!
- We got to jump.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.063
Looks good to me.

18:29.150 --> 18:31.311
Move! We're gonna have to jump.

18:31.402 --> 18:33.063
What? No, we can't! No, we can't!

18:33.154 --> 18:34.735
It's not deep enough.

18:36.282 --> 18:37.567
It's deep enough.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.052
Oh, my god! That's no way of telling!

18:39.076 --> 18:40.846
Hey! Do you want to take
a fucking stand here?

18:40.870 --> 18:42.076
Because we're gonna die.

18:42.163 --> 18:43.824
Bo, you good?

18:43.914 --> 18:45.495
- I'm running...
- Change!

18:50.713 --> 18:52.669
Come on, come on, come on.

18:52.757 --> 18:53.757
There you go.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.012
We can't!

19:02.767 --> 19:04.974
This is my last one! We need a plan!

19:05.978 --> 19:08.219
Hey, boss! What's the plan?

19:10.149 --> 19:11.789
- Fuck.
- Sam, what are we doing?

19:11.859 --> 19:14.601
- What are we doing?
- Take out your plates.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.423
- Get rid of your longs.
- Keep it down! Keep it down!

19:16.447 --> 19:17.799
Anything that's gonna drag you down.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.360
- We have to jump!
- There's no way!

19:20.451 --> 19:24.535
We're losing our longs? Losing our armor?
She's fucking this up!

19:24.622 --> 19:26.662
Hey, you know, we stay here,
we're gonna die, right?

19:26.749 --> 19:28.705
We can't jump! Please, please, please!

19:28.793 --> 19:31.079
You think we wanna die
from jumpin' off a cliff?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.170
Fucking nuts!

19:32.254 --> 19:33.934
I'm not gettin' paid enough for this shit!

19:34.382 --> 19:36.839
Killing bad guys is one thing,
losing that shit...

19:38.135 --> 19:39.500
Listen to me...

19:39.595 --> 19:40.801
- I can't swim.
- Hey, hey.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.449
You can do anything
that you need to do to survive.

19:42.473 --> 19:43.659
You've already survived this far.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.298
Look at this. This jump? It's nothing.

19:45.393 --> 19:46.929
It's nothing, it's just air.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.180
That river, it's nothing. It's just water.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.852
You can do this, we're gonna be okay.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.147
I'm out!

19:59.990 --> 20:01.230
Masakh.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.817
Masakh!

20:06.205 --> 20:08.537
What are you doing? Get down!

20:08.624 --> 20:10.831
Get down!

20:11.919 --> 20:13.204
Not here, my friend.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.331
That man, he needs to die!

20:17.174 --> 20:19.586
- Take your revenge another time.
- We've got to move!

20:19.677 --> 20:21.154
- Pata, now, move!
- Listen to me...

20:21.178 --> 20:22.178
- Move!
- Let's go!

20:22.221 --> 20:23.221
- Okay.
- Okay?

20:23.264 --> 20:25.425
Pata! Let's move!

20:25.516 --> 20:27.006
Go, go, go, go, go!

20:32.064 --> 20:33.929
We gotta go. We gotta move. Move!

20:34.024 --> 20:38.484
Anyone want to go for a swim?
Get your bikini! Go! Go!

20:42.408 --> 20:43.528
No, no, no! We're gonna die!

20:47.163 --> 20:49.099
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.
It's gonna be fine.

20:49.123 --> 20:50.123
Come on. Trust me.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.743
Trust me!

20:56.839 --> 20:59.672
You ready? On me. Move!

20:59.759 --> 21:01.215
Go! Let's go!

21:03.804 --> 21:05.795
Tj! No! Dammit!

21:05.890 --> 21:08.302
Shit. Get her. Come here.
Get her, get her, get her.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.688
Hey, hey, pressure on the wound.
Tj, put pressure on the wound.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.067
Bo, I'm out!

21:19.069 --> 21:20.069
Go!

21:24.200 --> 21:26.566
- I'm done. Just go!
- No. No!

21:26.660 --> 21:28.305
You know what they're gonna do to a woman.

21:28.329 --> 21:31.742
I'll cover you. Don't worry,
I'll be dead before they get me.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.492
- Moving!
- Let's swim!

21:38.798 --> 21:39.958
I'm covering!

21:42.718 --> 21:44.003
Shit!

21:44.094 --> 21:46.085
Jj

22:09.411 --> 22:10.776
Where are the girls?

22:19.004 --> 22:20.585
Where are the girls?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.811
I've got you. I've got you. I've got you.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.987
Shit!

22:56.208 --> 22:58.119
Jj

23:11.807 --> 23:13.297
Come on.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.088
- Hold on!
- Grab me by the hand!

23:25.112 --> 23:27.112
- Come on, grab.
- Come on. Grab her!

23:28.032 --> 23:29.676
- I got you.
- Head count, head count!

23:29.700 --> 23:31.406
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

23:31.493 --> 23:32.949
Are you okay, bruv?

23:34.038 --> 23:35.994
God, I'm so cold!

23:36.081 --> 23:38.117
Come on, you gotta get up.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.542
Come on. Come on.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.967
We gotta go.
We didn't move that far.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.532
- Come on, you're there.
- Come on!

23:52.556 --> 23:54.236
We gotta keep moving.
We gotta keep moving.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.552
- There you go, buddy.
- Come on.

23:56.644 --> 23:59.135
- Good.
- Come on. Go.

23:59.229 --> 24:02.266
We gotta keep moving,
come on. Let's go.

24:02.358 --> 24:06.021
- Stick together!
- Barasa, on your feet.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.687
Jj

24:26.465 --> 24:29.332
Let's keep heading
down the river. Two clicks.

24:29.426 --> 24:31.587
And you're still in command?

24:35.766 --> 24:38.052
Yeah, you better
fucking believe that I am.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.510
Even after your fucking mess?
We'll see how much longer that lasts.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.723
Hey, hey. Another word out of your mouth,
and we've got a problem.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.860
We've already got a fucking problem!

24:54.368 --> 24:56.359
Jj

25:01.875 --> 25:06.244
We need to rest.
We need a break. Please!

25:06.338 --> 25:09.421
- Please, we need a fucking break!
- Come on.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.045
- We need to rest. I can't do it.
- Take my hand.

25:12.136 --> 25:14.377
You don't know
what we've been through!

25:14.471 --> 25:16.658
- There could be anything in there!
- Get in the fucking water!

25:16.682 --> 25:18.513
I'm not getting in the fucking water!

25:18.600 --> 25:21.433
If you don't get in the water,
you're gonna fucking die!

25:34.408 --> 25:35.768
You're wasting your ammo! Stop it!

25:37.036 --> 25:39.027
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

25:39.121 --> 25:40.952
Everybody, move back! Move, move!

25:41.040 --> 25:43.122
We need to move back.
There might be a new animal.

25:46.754 --> 25:48.540
We have to do something, Sam.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.292
She's dead. You're wasting ammo.

25:52.342 --> 25:56.130
Mike, Mike... they're gonna hear us.

25:57.681 --> 25:58.716
Come on.

26:00.350 --> 26:01.635
Move out!

26:30.089 --> 26:31.545
Zalaam!

26:31.632 --> 26:34.999
Brother, help me!

26:39.139 --> 26:40.970
You're dying, my brother.

26:41.058 --> 26:42.514
No...

26:42.601 --> 26:46.560
Yeah. Yes. It's okay.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.433
This is your time.

26:50.442 --> 26:54.651
Do you remember hillah? Huh?

26:54.738 --> 26:58.731
And all our brothers that were
slaughtered at that day? Huh?

26:58.826 --> 27:03.320
Do you remember the ground?
It was covered in blood, huh?

27:03.413 --> 27:07.326
And we'd say, it's as if the earth
was somehow crying for them.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.623
Do you remember that?

27:08.710 --> 27:11.372
For they wasn't crying out of sadness.

27:12.381 --> 27:15.123
They were crying out of joy.

27:15.217 --> 27:19.677
They are the lucky ones.

27:19.763 --> 27:24.427
They are the chosen ones...
To have died that day.

27:25.853 --> 27:29.846
And now... you are the chosen one now.

27:30.858 --> 27:32.143
I love you, my brother.

27:33.235 --> 27:34.600
But no more suffering.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.064
Jj

27:52.004 --> 27:53.790
- Yeah.
- Easy, easy, easy.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.886
- Looks like a guard post.
- Guarding what?

28:05.184 --> 28:07.220
Here, you guys sit down.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.390
Guys, we got buildings up there.

28:16.445 --> 28:19.152
- Why don't you two go check it out?
- Oh, yippie!

28:21.283 --> 28:23.490
All right, me and you, Bo. Let's go.

28:25.913 --> 28:28.154
It's going to be
a poacher's moon tonight.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.614
Bad for us.

28:31.877 --> 28:33.037
Why is that?

28:33.128 --> 28:34.584
It's a full moon, my friend.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.129
Abundant light in the night.

28:39.134 --> 28:42.752
Therefore, we are easy to see,
easy to hunt.

28:42.846 --> 28:45.804
Hunt? Really?

28:45.891 --> 28:48.473
You think zalaam is gonna
give up so easily?

28:50.103 --> 28:52.264
She's the governor's daughter.

28:54.441 --> 28:58.275
With her in his hand,
zalaam is wielding much power.

28:59.613 --> 29:03.197
And he will not stop until he has
the entire government on their knees...

29:03.283 --> 29:05.444
Hey, pata, bro.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.318
That's enough.

29:09.706 --> 29:10.991
That's enough.

29:15.045 --> 29:18.082
I'm sorry. No, we are well,
going to be safe here.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.126
Jj

29:38.610 --> 29:41.101
Hey, this is the last time.

29:41.196 --> 29:42.924
Last time you said,
"this was the last time."

29:42.948 --> 29:44.717
Yeah, but this time,
it's really the last time.

29:44.741 --> 29:47.949
- Mm.
- That was a shit sandwich back there.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.822
Tell me you don't think
she fucked up, huh?

29:49.913 --> 29:52.074
The plan was to rescue one girl.
We rescue three.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.497
Different plan. Different outcome.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.129
Yeah.

30:11.268 --> 30:12.929
I wonder what this place is.

30:13.020 --> 30:15.386
Looks like a farm.
What do you think they kept here?

30:16.523 --> 30:17.523
I don't know.

30:19.109 --> 30:22.046
- Let me know when you got an opinion.
- Yeah, you'll be the first to know.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.810
This looks like home.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.861
Yeah.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.780
- Let's knock.
- Yeah.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.445
Jj

30:58.482 --> 31:00.848
- Clear.
- Yeah, it's good.

31:01.860 --> 31:02.940
Well done.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.106
You got a "well done.â

31:06.198 --> 31:08.063
Shouldn't we ask...

31:08.158 --> 31:10.444
Sit there.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.742
Shouldn't we ask the owner's permission?

31:12.829 --> 31:16.071
- We looked. No one here.
- Finders keepers, right? Mm.

31:16.166 --> 31:17.576
Where do you think they went?

31:19.461 --> 31:21.167
We're gonna find out.

31:21.254 --> 31:23.415
- Eli, you good?
- Always.

31:23.507 --> 31:26.624
You guys get cleaned up.
Joey, take care of that.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.131
- The shit just hit the fan.
- Good time to go sober.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.009
Never a good time.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.591
Pata, barasa, I want you on watch.
Keep on comms.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.389
Copy you.

31:38.480 --> 31:43.224
Wait, wait. So we just wait here
until they come again?

31:43.318 --> 31:46.310
We're far ahead. They're not
gonna be able to track us.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.005
We're gonna find a way to call for help.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.609
What about the sat phone?

31:49.699 --> 31:51.699
It's fucked.
Bullet went right through it.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.119
I guess they don't make these .762 proof.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.071
You got the receipt?

31:58.166 --> 31:59.952
Well, don't you guys have radios?

32:00.043 --> 32:03.581
- Just for us. Not enough range.
- Oh, okay.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.084
Don't worry. We got this.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.010
You guys get some rest. You two, on me.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.592
Oh, shit.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.222
Fucking things.

32:20.605 --> 32:22.015
Waterlogged.

32:22.107 --> 32:24.018
Any one of you got a bowl of rice?

32:24.109 --> 32:25.645
Don't look at me, huh?

32:28.905 --> 32:30.145
Chinaman.

32:31.324 --> 32:33.315
Jj

32:48.049 --> 32:49.129
You okay?

32:49.217 --> 32:51.583
Yeah. Are you?

32:51.678 --> 32:54.340
- Yeah.
- Good.

32:54.431 --> 32:57.034
You two check the perimeter.
If you hear or see anything, check in.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.798
Copy you.

32:58.894 --> 33:00.759
Radio check.

33:00.854 --> 33:03.140
- Good check.
- Good check.

33:13.700 --> 33:17.113
Thanks, Joey.

33:17.204 --> 33:19.115
- Can you grab my med kit?
- Yeah.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.572
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

33:25.879 --> 33:27.995
Ooh. Who's hungry?

33:28.089 --> 33:29.169
Ll am.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.963
What is it?

33:31.051 --> 33:32.757
Energy bar.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.551
Oh, okay. Better than nothing.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.338
Don't eat all at once, huh?

33:39.434 --> 33:42.392
Okay, slowly, slowly.

33:42.479 --> 33:43.389
Joey.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.480
Hey, thanks, brother.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.313
It's so good, but so gross.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.400
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-mm.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.183
Like cup noodles. Mmm.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.436
Can I help you?

33:53.532 --> 33:55.193
It's not the first time.

33:56.576 --> 33:57.986
What, that you've been shot?

33:58.078 --> 34:00.660
Yeah, shot, stabbed, beaten.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.033
And that was before
he joined the marines.

34:05.085 --> 34:06.120
No, it's right there.

34:09.255 --> 34:13.750
So why is she in charge?
Sam, or whatever her name is?

34:13.842 --> 34:18.507
Oh... you should ask her.

34:18.598 --> 34:20.158
Her dad's the governor.
He employed her.

34:21.976 --> 34:23.933
And so she employs you guys?

34:24.020 --> 34:26.261
Yeah. It's okay, I got it. I got it.

34:27.482 --> 34:29.313
So you're just in this for the money.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.857
What, you want me to fight for free?

34:32.152 --> 34:33.984
Why not? Zealots and believers do.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.529
And ain't they just the loveliest people.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.607
So if she didn't pay you...

34:39.619 --> 34:41.826
We'd still be in those fucking cages?

34:41.913 --> 34:44.370
Tessa, they're trying to help us.

34:44.456 --> 34:47.449
I know. I mean,
this is just a job to them.

34:47.543 --> 34:50.411
She's just a boss, and they
don't even fucking like her.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.338
Who likes their boss, huh?

34:53.425 --> 34:56.632
Yeah, but you don't think
that she can do this, do you?

35:01.266 --> 35:03.678
- I just think that...
- Is she good?

35:06.938 --> 35:08.849
Yeah, yeah.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.228
Yeah, she's good.
She's been in the suck,

35:12.319 --> 35:15.231
and she's been in some gnarly places,
and she came out forged hard.

35:16.531 --> 35:18.613
Maybe too hard.

35:18.700 --> 35:22.192
But she will... get us out of here?

35:53.985 --> 35:55.100
Yes.

36:02.327 --> 36:05.319
Fuck. There's no power.

36:06.998 --> 36:10.331
The whole camp doesn't have power.
The generator must be off.

36:17.425 --> 36:21.134
Okay, we find the gennie, get it started,
and get this kit back online.

36:22.138 --> 36:23.674
Call for an extraction.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.175
That sounds like a plan...

36:26.351 --> 36:28.387
If we can find the generator.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.847
Huh, back in business, bruv.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.686
Fuckin' wonder where everyone went.

36:38.405 --> 36:41.772
There are many abandoned farms
and villages here.

36:41.866 --> 36:45.029
So, when al-shabaab came,
many people ran away.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.906
Others were killed.

36:46.996 --> 36:48.987
So you're from here?

36:49.082 --> 36:52.574
I am Maasai, yes.
So this whole area was my home.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.418
When did you move?

36:55.505 --> 36:58.747
I didn't. I stayed.

37:03.179 --> 37:06.012
- You're actually saying you joined them.
- I stayed.

37:06.099 --> 37:07.739
I believed everything
the imam was saying.

37:07.767 --> 37:09.928
I was a young person. What?

37:10.019 --> 37:13.261
That's why you knew that big tosser
back at the cliff.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.017
Masakh.

37:15.108 --> 37:19.317
You see, that man...
I'm telling you, one day, I will kill him.

37:19.404 --> 37:22.362
For all of my sins and his.

37:22.449 --> 37:26.909
We've all done bad things, bruv.
That's how we end up here.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.922
What do you think dug this?

37:45.013 --> 37:46.719
It's big rats.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.261
Big, big, big rats.

38:06.910 --> 38:09.697
Mm... look at this mess.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.745
Blood in the backyard, too.
What do you think?

38:16.836 --> 38:19.168
Looks like the driver
was cut up and dragged out.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.916
Yeah, it looks like it.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.958
This one's left running.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.373
Looks like they were trying
to get away when they were hit.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.429
By what?

38:29.516 --> 38:31.427
I don't know. Big rats.

38:33.895 --> 38:37.934
This place just... feels wrong.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.936
Are we doing feelings now?

38:42.362 --> 38:44.694
Yeah, I got feelings.

38:44.781 --> 38:46.021
I know you do.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.969
What I'm saying is that I don't think
it's a bad idea

38:48.993 --> 38:51.985
if you just show it, you know,
just-just every now and then.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.117
Oh, yeah? What good is that gonna do?

38:55.208 --> 38:58.166
Makes you human, Sam.
It'll help you keep your team in line.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.539
My team is getting paid to be in line.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.831
Not the ones that don't make it home.

39:08.221 --> 39:09.961
Hey, Sam.

39:11.307 --> 39:14.344
I've got your back. Always.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.350
On three.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.319
Three.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.363
What the fuck is this?

39:34.539 --> 39:36.951
It's what I thought... a lion farm.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.373
Poachers' stronghold.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.952
A lion farm? Why would you farm lions?

39:43.047 --> 39:44.628
You can't eat 'em.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.298
Oh, their skins?

39:47.385 --> 39:48.465
And these bones crushed up?

39:49.846 --> 39:51.586
It's worth a lot of money in the east.

39:53.266 --> 39:55.052
- Fuckers.
- I thought that was tigers.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.181
Tigers started becoming rare,
so they turned to lions.

39:59.272 --> 40:01.183
Now the lions are becoming rare.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.604
The difference is that they breed
really well in captivity.

40:05.695 --> 40:07.777
So we have lion farms.

40:09.699 --> 40:13.863
All the big males are shot
in canned lion-hunting farms.

40:13.953 --> 40:18.117
Some rich, fucking lazy
dickhead comes here with $100,000,

40:18.207 --> 40:21.620
shoots the animal, flies back, he's got
a nice big head he can put on his wall,

40:21.711 --> 40:26.831
and a story about how brave he was
to kill the king of the jungle.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.506
These animals have never known freedom.

40:28.593 --> 40:31.209
Where they put them out,
that's where they die.

40:31.304 --> 40:34.216
- That's fucked up.
- It is fucked up.

40:34.307 --> 40:36.013
This is fucked up.

40:39.771 --> 40:43.684
Looks like maybe the lions
got their own back.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.436
Good.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.605
- What do you think, like...
- Hmm.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.357
I don't know. Maybe two days?

40:50.448 --> 40:52.279
Hmm, huh.

40:54.077 --> 40:56.819
I don't know. I don't know.
I can't tell in this heat.

40:59.832 --> 41:03.871
Generator went down...
The lions dug themselves out.

41:06.005 --> 41:07.836
Okay, but where did they go?

41:09.592 --> 41:11.958
Back to the bush. There's no reason
for them to stay here.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.545
Good luck to them.

41:17.934 --> 41:19.765
You know, Sam, when I was a little boy...

41:19.852 --> 41:21.997
Oh, here we go.
Another "when I was a little boy" story.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.916
- No, no, no. This is a good one.
- I can't wait.

41:23.940 --> 41:26.682
When I was a little boy, I used to dream
about being chased by lions.

41:26.776 --> 41:29.483
And no matter how fast
or how high I jumped,

41:29.570 --> 41:31.401
those motherfuckers...

41:31.489 --> 41:34.447
Hey, boss.
This place looks deserted.

41:34.534 --> 41:36.240
You got anything?

41:36.327 --> 41:39.239
Yeah. We got a couple of ripe bodies.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.821
- It's pretty gnarly.
- Copy you.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.747
Got few more of these huts
to check out.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.871
Stand by.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.078
Elijah?

41:53.136 --> 41:55.127
Jj

42:03.479 --> 42:04.719
Elijah?!

42:10.236 --> 42:12.648
Elijah?!

42:15.491 --> 42:16.776
Elijah!

42:17.869 --> 42:19.780
Jj

42:59.202 --> 43:00.408
Oh, shit...

43:01.412 --> 43:02.618
Fuck...

43:06.667 --> 43:07.873
Elijah.

43:10.088 --> 43:11.624
Elijah.

43:25.728 --> 43:28.561
Jj

43:29.732 --> 43:31.768
- What are they shooting at?!
- Get down! Get down!

43:31.859 --> 43:33.565
Get down! Get down! Shh.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.018
What do you see?

43:35.113 --> 43:36.799
- Okay, okay.
- What do you see?

43:36.823 --> 43:38.984
Stay down. Get down.

43:39.075 --> 43:40.531
- Quiet.
- Please.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.028
- Okay.
- Shh.

43:42.120 --> 43:45.203
Hey, Bo.
You stay with them, okay?

43:45.289 --> 43:47.780
No, you stay. You're more injured.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.116
This?

43:50.211 --> 43:52.293
What's that?

43:57.176 --> 43:59.713
Hey, be my guest.

43:59.804 --> 44:01.169
You're supposed to argue more.

44:01.264 --> 44:03.050
Nah, we're good.

44:13.234 --> 44:15.225
Jj

44:41.053 --> 44:43.214
- Jesus...
- What is it? What happened?

44:43.306 --> 44:45.242
- Something took Elijah.
- What do you mean, something?

44:45.266 --> 44:47.257
- Is he dead?
- Yes, he's fucking dead.

44:47.351 --> 44:49.307
He-he's torn to pieces.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.862
Jj

46:01.634 --> 46:06.674
Bo yinn, what would
your mother say, huh?

46:06.764 --> 46:08.345
She'd say...

46:09.558 --> 46:12.550
Oh, shit!

46:12.645 --> 46:14.306
Shit. Stay here.

46:14.397 --> 46:15.682
Don't move! Don't move!

46:15.773 --> 46:17.809
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.731
Bo! Bo!

46:34.208 --> 46:35.664
Lion...

46:38.379 --> 46:39.664
A lion...

46:39.755 --> 46:42.667
I got it.

46:42.758 --> 46:44.544
- It's injured.
- Yeah, good job.

46:44.635 --> 46:45.750
You tagged it, buddy.

46:45.845 --> 46:47.255
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:47.346 --> 46:49.257
Yeah.

46:49.348 --> 46:52.340
Ooh, got you too a little bit, huh?

46:52.435 --> 46:55.302
Okay, he got me, too. Just a little bit.

46:55.396 --> 46:58.479
- What the fuck happened here?
- A fucking lion got him.

46:58.566 --> 47:01.103
Shit. One killed Elijah, too.

47:01.193 --> 47:03.184
Elijah's dead?

47:03.279 --> 47:05.549
- All right, put it down.
- Okay, get his webbing off.

47:05.573 --> 47:07.217
- Look at me, Bo. Look at me.
- Get his webbing off, we need to see.

47:07.241 --> 47:09.357
There you go. There you go.

47:09.452 --> 47:12.194
Okay, he's got lacerations
all up the left side.

47:12.288 --> 47:14.016
- Morphine! Give him that morphine.
- He's bleeding out here.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.642
- What happened to him?
- Someone get the tourniquet.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.453
- Someone talk to me!
- Okay. Bo, look at me.

47:18.544 --> 47:20.647
Give him the lollipop.
He needs the morphine. Get it.

47:20.671 --> 47:21.877
What the fuck happened to him?

47:21.964 --> 47:24.080
- A lion!
- My god!

47:24.175 --> 47:25.039
Come help. Help now.

47:25.134 --> 47:26.570
Hold on.
This is gonna hurt, buddy.

47:26.594 --> 47:28.630
- Lion attack him.
- There you go.

47:28.721 --> 47:30.561
I need you
to put pressure on this wound.

47:30.598 --> 47:32.451
- Hold on, man. Hold on, Bo.
- No, I don't wanna hurt him.

47:32.475 --> 47:34.761
Put pressure on the wound,
or he'll fucking die.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.538
- I got it. I got it.
- There you go.

47:36.562 --> 47:38.682
- Press it down. Down.
- Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

47:38.731 --> 47:40.687
- Hold on, buddy.
- Oh, fuck.

47:40.775 --> 47:43.357
- There you go.
- Hey, Bo?

47:43.444 --> 47:44.980
- Hey, hey...
- Hey, hey, hey.

47:45.071 --> 47:45.981
Stay with me.

47:46.072 --> 47:47.357
- Stay with us!
- Stay here.

47:47.448 --> 47:48.717
- Bo, in the room, in the room.
- Fuck. Fuck!

47:48.741 --> 47:50.948
J everybody j

47:51.035 --> 47:52.616
j yeah j - open up.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.194
- & rock your body &
- What the fuck?

47:55.289 --> 47:56.369
J yeah j

47:56.457 --> 47:58.948
& everybody j

47:59.043 --> 48:02.456
j rock your body right j

48:02.546 --> 48:05.379
j backstreet's back, all right! J

48:05.466 --> 48:07.627
you're right, it is very annoying.

48:07.718 --> 48:10.004
- Very annoying.
- It's very annoying.

48:10.179 --> 48:12.090
Jj

48:21.899 --> 48:25.483
Boss, boss! I've picked up their trail.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.184
- Where?
- Five miles, south.

48:27.279 --> 48:30.521
- Well done, brother. Let's go!
- Come on. Come on!

48:32.076 --> 48:34.067
Jj

48:43.254 --> 48:45.119
Joey, Mike.

48:58.394 --> 49:00.134
I gave him all the morphine we had.

49:00.229 --> 49:02.311
The bleeding has stopped,
but he needs an extraction.

49:02.398 --> 49:05.731
- We all need an extraction.
- So we gotta get comms up.

49:06.735 --> 49:08.851
All right. So this is us.

49:08.946 --> 49:12.154
There's a vhf radio in this building,
but it has no power.

49:12.241 --> 49:14.553
I didn't see a generator,
but you gotta assume there is one.

49:14.577 --> 49:16.488
Uh, you also gotta assume
that it's out of gas.

49:16.579 --> 49:19.241
So we're gonna
identify the generator, gas it up,

49:19.331 --> 49:22.323
get the power on, get the radio working.

49:22.418 --> 49:23.783
All before our friends come back.

49:23.878 --> 49:25.539
Lion friends, or terrorist friends?

49:25.629 --> 49:26.709
Grindr friends.

49:28.007 --> 49:29.622
Look, I think we can do this.

49:29.717 --> 49:31.548
I know we've all been through a lot worse.

49:31.635 --> 49:35.969
No. Not without ammo,
fucking weapons, or some backup.

49:36.056 --> 49:37.967
There's a first time for everything.

49:39.226 --> 49:41.666
Plus, I think there's many places
a lion can hide here.

49:41.729 --> 49:44.186
And why is the fucking thing still here?

49:44.273 --> 49:47.606
Seriously, why isn't it out
with his fucking fuzzy friends out there?

49:49.028 --> 49:52.612
Because some lions go rogue.
They like to kill.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.441
So we're at the bottom of the food chain.

49:58.078 --> 50:00.078
What's the deal with the ammo?
What do we got left?

50:09.590 --> 50:12.002
That's nothing. Jesus.

50:12.092 --> 50:14.128
Shooting her won't help anyway.

50:14.220 --> 50:15.460
This caliber...

50:16.514 --> 50:18.345
This is not going to stop her.

50:18.432 --> 50:21.424
It might annoy her,
but she will kill you first.

50:21.519 --> 50:23.259
How do you know it's a "she"?

50:24.563 --> 50:26.724
Because females are the true killers.

50:29.985 --> 50:33.193
Okay. Well, what about, uh,
what about fire?

50:33.280 --> 50:36.192
They're afraid of fire, right?
Can we make that work?

50:36.283 --> 50:39.650
Truth with lions, actually,
they're not afraid of fire.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.656
In fact, it might even attract them.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.811
Makes you wonder how the fuck we got out
of Africa in the first place, huh?

50:46.835 --> 50:49.497
Why do you know so much about lions?

50:49.588 --> 50:53.046
Our Maasai people have been
living alongside lions for generations.

50:53.133 --> 50:57.251
Hunting them is a tradition.
Passage into manhood.

50:57.346 --> 51:00.804
In fact, a boy has to kill
3 lion in order to be a man.

51:01.809 --> 51:03.094
So you've killed one?

51:06.605 --> 51:09.312
No, I didn't.

51:09.400 --> 51:12.016
I couldn't. I just couldn't.

51:12.111 --> 51:16.571
I couldn't take life in order to prove
some kind of ideal of manhood.

51:19.702 --> 51:22.489
I... I shamed my family.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.913
Hey, I-I think that the ability to kill

51:26.000 --> 51:28.912
is the least quality
that it takes to be a man.

51:33.299 --> 51:35.415
So what do you do
when something tries to kill you?

51:37.636 --> 51:39.467
I guess we'll find out.

51:46.770 --> 51:49.728
- You ready?
- Yeah.

51:49.815 --> 51:52.557
Barasa, you see anything?

51:55.529 --> 51:57.485
Almost in position, boss.

51:58.782 --> 52:00.067
Stand by.

52:11.086 --> 52:12.417
Okay.

52:17.217 --> 52:18.217
Come on.

52:20.137 --> 52:23.925
Oh, fuck. Where's this fucking thing?

52:26.727 --> 52:28.968
I'm gonna go check
these buildings over here.

52:29.063 --> 52:31.475
- You get our six.
- Copy.

52:31.565 --> 52:36.025
Sam... Sam, don't run.

52:37.029 --> 52:38.565
Do not act like prey.

52:41.950 --> 52:43.440
We are prey.

52:43.535 --> 52:45.526
Jj

52:52.294 --> 52:55.502
- It's just a walk in the woods.
- I hate the woods.

53:11.605 --> 53:15.268
Got ya. It's all clear, boss.

53:15.359 --> 53:16.599
Copy.

53:19.196 --> 53:21.187
Jj

53:32.418 --> 53:36.912
Pata, eyes on you.
You hold there.

53:37.005 --> 53:38.870
Okay, copy you.

53:41.093 --> 53:43.084
Jj

54:01.864 --> 54:03.820
Wait! Stop, stop, stop!

54:04.825 --> 54:07.407
The lion is right there.

54:07.494 --> 54:09.701
Ten o'clock. Keep still, don't move.

54:22.092 --> 54:23.172
Fucking things!

54:24.178 --> 54:28.012
Talk to me. Where is she?

54:28.098 --> 54:30.714
Bear with me, boss.
Technical problems.

54:30.809 --> 54:33.391
Not prey. Not prey. Not prey.

54:33.479 --> 54:34.594
Not prey.

54:37.566 --> 54:40.353
Barasa, can you see her?

54:42.112 --> 54:44.444
Okay, okay,
just-just give me a second.

54:44.531 --> 54:45.771
We go back?

54:47.493 --> 54:49.404
We gotta have that radio, Joey.

54:51.497 --> 54:54.284
Barasa, anything?

54:54.374 --> 54:55.614
Okay, stand by.

55:01.715 --> 55:02.795
Fuck.

55:04.384 --> 55:05.965
We lost her, boss.

55:10.766 --> 55:12.381
Start walking.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.472
Jj

55:16.563 --> 55:18.303
Get me eyes on her. Copy?

55:18.398 --> 55:19.854
Stand by, boss.

55:20.859 --> 55:22.599
Fucking equipment failure.

55:29.159 --> 55:30.569
Nothing, boss.

55:30.661 --> 55:34.370
Okay. I'll go east, you go west.

55:35.958 --> 55:37.949
Jj

55:47.678 --> 55:51.170
Oh, yes! Wow!

55:55.978 --> 55:58.219
Fuck. Shit!

55:59.523 --> 56:02.230
Oh, shit!

56:05.153 --> 56:08.611
Joey, I found the generator,
but there's no fuel.

56:10.325 --> 56:12.907
I can fix that. I found the fuel.

56:12.995 --> 56:14.906
Bring it to me.

56:14.997 --> 56:16.328
Yeah, coming now.

56:34.683 --> 56:36.594
Fucking thing!

56:36.685 --> 56:38.471
Shit.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.095
Fucking things!

56:52.242 --> 56:54.233
Thank you.

56:57.581 --> 56:59.492
There. All right.

57:01.460 --> 57:03.041
Oh, my gosh!

57:05.797 --> 57:06.797
C'm on!

57:10.636 --> 57:12.172
Yeah, that's it.

57:13.430 --> 57:15.421
Jj

58:13.490 --> 58:15.355
We're back in business, boss.

58:42.477 --> 58:45.514
Yeah. All right.

58:48.150 --> 58:51.187
C'mon, baby.

59:06.960 --> 59:08.040
All right.

59:15.844 --> 59:17.835
Jj

59:24.311 --> 59:26.017
No! No, no.

59:28.732 --> 59:30.142
Boss...

59:31.610 --> 59:32.610
She got him.

59:33.987 --> 59:35.272
Barasa's gone.

59:38.658 --> 59:40.649
Shit! On me!

59:49.377 --> 59:51.368
Goodbye, my friend.

59:59.805 --> 01:00:01.511
Station one, this is rogue team, over.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:05.056
Come on...

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:07.600
Station one, this is rogue team, over.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:11.350
Rogue team, go for station one.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:14.604
We lost the osprey extraction,
and we're in urgent need of assistance.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:17.731
We have the governor's daughter plus one.
She's a British national.

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:21.532
We've an al-shabaab militia group
in close proximity.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.358
We're out of ammo.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.490
We have multiple wounded,
we have hostile animals near.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:28.993
We're in urgent need
of extraction. How copy?

01:00:31.044 --> 01:00:33.626
Copy that. That's a negative
on extraction.

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:37.046
No asset free until dawn.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:42.176
Negative. We're not
gonna make it six hours.

01:00:42.264 --> 01:00:44.971
We need assistance now.
Put Briggs on.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:46.594
Roger that.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.929
Sam, this is Briggs.
Send sitrep.

01:00:52.023 --> 01:00:53.604
We have the girl.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:55.774
Good job. I'll let the governor know.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:58.819
Heard you're having a little trouble?

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:02.568
We're not gonna make the night.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:05.696
You will. You always do, Sam.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.698
That's why I bring you
on the tough jobs.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:13.250
Make it till dawn, and I promise you,
I'll get you out of there.

01:01:19.217 --> 01:01:20.957
Dawn. Copy. Out.

01:01:26.975 --> 01:01:30.559
Whose stupid fucking idea
was this mission anyway?

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:32.977
Uh, yours.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.310
Oh, yeah.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:40.064
Help is coming.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:43.134
We just have to stay here
a little while longer.

01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:46.366
- How much longer?
- Till sunrise.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.906
What? We can't do that.

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:51.363
Yes, you can. Just a few more hours.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.574
But, Sam, they will come for us.

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:56.330
They won't. They don't know
where you are. You're safe, it's fine.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:59.709
We're not safe here.
Zalaam does not give up.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.382
She is of value to them.

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:04.755
She was not taken
just for a ransom of money.

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.087
She means they have power
over her father.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:09.594
That gives him control
over this entire region.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.930
You seem to know an awful lot about him.

01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:14.352
Why is that?

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:16.100
Because I was an al-shabaab soldier.

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:19.057
I'm sorry. What the fuck?

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:21.268
Hey, no!

01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:23.228
You're one of them!

01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:25.283
Does my father know
that you've trusted the enemy?

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:26.844
Your father knows
a lot more than you think.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:27.868
What does that mean?

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:30.035
We couldn't have rescued you
without pata.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.495
I'll take this, okay?

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.493
No bullets. We're out of ammo, remember?

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.165
The men that took us are evil!

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:38.915
I'm not evil! I'm not like one of them!

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:43.294
I would never be abducting
little girls and be...

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.125
Asilia, asilia, show 'em.

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.461
- Oh, fucking Christ!
- No!

01:02:47.555 --> 01:02:49.762
He needs to see! Look at this!

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:52.886
They whipped her,
and they beat us! Look at that!

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.688
I don't know what your idea of evil is,

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.711
but if you're with the kind
of people that do that,

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:03.727
then you're not coming out the other side
as mother fucking Theresa.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:13.821
I was... I was young
when I... when I joined.

01:03:13.915 --> 01:03:15.325
So?

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:17.624
I tried to leave long ago.

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.201
But they made it clear that...

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.334
If you leave, they will kill your children
and your family.

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:24.790
So I stayed.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:31.843
Zalaam came from england,
a man with many ideas to teach us.

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:34.299
To teach the people the ways of Allah.

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:36.180
Jesus Christ, get to the fucking point!

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:37.636
I left!

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:39.847
We escaped, okay? That is why I'm here.

01:03:41.192 --> 01:03:42.682
But they came.

01:03:42.777 --> 01:03:46.861
And they did exactly
what they said that they would do.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.482
My children...

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.030
My family...

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:59.916
All of them, you see?

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:03.040
And they decided to-to keep me alive,

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.543
and they made me watch.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:13.513
They came to our school... our class.

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:18.597
They lined eight of us against the wall...

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:22.977
Told us to get down on our knees,

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:27.232
bound our hands behind our back,
put bags over our heads.

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:31.985
And he said, if we made a sound...

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:35.693
He would shoot us.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:44.624
And we waited. We waited to die.

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:51.422
We didn't make a sound.

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:56.932
I waited my turn to die!

01:04:57.936 --> 01:05:01.144
We waited our turn to die!

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:09.273
He killed them, when they could've
just taken me!

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.939
I never saw any hostages.

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:16.151
Those hostages have names!

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:17.611
We have names!

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:22.369
What were your children's names?

01:05:25.505 --> 01:05:27.041
What were their names?

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.001
What were their names?

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:35.344
I'm sorry.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:46.105
Boss, somebody needs to keep watch.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:51.402
I need to keep watch, boss.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:12.257
- The others in position?
- All in position.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:15.585
Spread out. Come in from all sides.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.797
And remember, the girl lives.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.429
Everyone else, do as Allah commands.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:23.979
Go!

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.102
It's about time
we let them know we're here.

01:06:28.193 --> 01:06:30.935
- Yeah, it is.
- You got the c-47?

01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:33.482
Let's go.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:18.482
She's a good girl.

01:07:19.494 --> 01:07:20.609
Yeah.

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.287
She cares about things.

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:25.989
More than I do, anyway.

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:29.124
Are you guys friends?

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:32.249
Hmm, not really.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.582
I mean, I hardly knew her
before this little adventure.

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:37.508
Why are you in Africaâ?

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:40.595
Just lucky, I guess.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:43.264
My parents' grand idea to help ground me

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:46.468
was to send me
to an expensive international school.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:50.647
Wow. Count yourself lucky.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:56.353
I mean, my parents sent me
to military academy when I was 13.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:08:00.110
I don't think I even
left campus before I was 16.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:02.157
From there, it was
straight into basic training,

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:05.487
and then right into the rangers academy.

01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:09.954
So no husband, kids, ten cats?

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.410
No, no, and no. Mm.

01:08:13.673 --> 01:08:17.586
I live a moment away from death,
either mine or someone else's,

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:21.761
so I just don't really want to do that
to another person, you know.

01:08:21.848 --> 01:08:23.554
Yeah.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.929
I mean, I figured you were just too much
of a bitch for someone to handle.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.636
Yeah, there is that.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:35.559
So what are you gonna do
when you get home?

01:08:37.196 --> 01:08:38.685
You think we're getting home?

01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:42.694
Five more hours. Cakewalk.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.991
He's here, he's here!

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.787
Zalaam is here! He's coming!

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:49.875
Sit down.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:51.282
Hey, just get over there.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.459
Sit down. Sit now!

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.912
Okay, so I spotted a scout
over on the east side.

01:08:56.924 --> 01:08:58.334
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Hey!

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.029
What are you doing, you crazy little man?

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:02.385
I heard there is a fight
that I didn't want to miss out.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:05.805
Okay, there's no ammo in this.
You're gonna stay here with the girls.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:08.474
No, I can fight. Let me fight.
I can't just sit here.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.663
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
Sit the fuck down, right now!

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:11.723
- No!
- Captain's orders.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:15.102
She's not a captain.
Are you? Are you a captain?

01:09:15.193 --> 01:09:17.058
You know I'm a fucking captain, Bo.

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:18.438
- But you're a girl.
- Whoa! Hey!

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:19.631
That's just the morphine talking.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.317
Come here. Let's have a lie down.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.863
- I'm here.
- There you go, Bo. There you go.

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:25.737
And if you feel the need
to walk to that big,

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.535
bright light at the end of the tunnel,
just remember...

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:32.866
- J everybody &
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.451
J everybody j

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.002
Sam, what's the plan?

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:39.421
Sit down. Sit down!

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:41.841
- That's not the plan.
- Shut the fuck up! Sit down!

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.009
Holy shit, boss! Good news.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.636
Joey, what've you got?

01:09:48.725 --> 01:09:51.889
Boss, I found a Lee Enfield.
It's got nine rounds.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:53.749
I figured we could shoot
a couple of those fuckers,

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:55.559
take their aks, even the odds.

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:56.890
Boom!

01:09:58.403 --> 01:09:59.643
Get out!

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:01.352
Oh, shit!

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:05.398
Hey! Hey!

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:22.173
Get off me, you...

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:26.378
Hey! Me! Me! Look at me!

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.724
Oh, fuck!

01:10:49.871 --> 01:10:51.031
Tessa!

01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:51.219
Oh, fuck!

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.055
Okay. Well, that doesn't work.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:58.644
That's right.

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:01.063
Fuck you good. Fuck you, pussycat.

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.141
Just because I'm a fucking dog person, eh?

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.321
Come here, kitty cat!

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:24.538
Jj

01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:53.366
Sam, draw it out! Give me the shot!

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:57.529
Sam! Sam, you gotta move.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.329
You gotta draw it out so I can get a shot.

01:13:14.849 --> 01:13:16.055
Hey, kitty, kitty.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:20.635
Jj

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:46.168
Holy shit!

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:49.213
Well, turns out pata was right.
They really were coming.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.131
Jesus, Joey, that lion
really fucked you up.

01:13:51.218 --> 01:13:52.754
Yeah, I've had worse relationships.

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.961
But those scars,
they're deep on the inside.

01:13:55.056 --> 01:13:57.513
Can you see them?
You good for this fight?

01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.386
Are you good to do this?

01:13:59.477 --> 01:14:01.889
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got a...
I got a little gas in the tank.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:03.939
No, not a whole, but light...
Lights on, you know,

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:05.354
but it's not empty.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.228
Good - yeah, you want a gun?

01:14:08.319 --> 01:14:10.981
No, no, I'm gonna figure something out.
You keep this.

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:14.112
- Let's go get the girls.
- Let's fucking go.

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:19.322
All right, fuckers! Move!

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:20.994
Light 'em up!

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:23.416
Keep moving, boss!

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:25.999
- Boss?
- Moving!

01:14:31.968 --> 01:14:32.968
Move!

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:40.517
Are you okay?

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:41.601
He's here.

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:43.392
/zalaam"s here?

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.310
Yeah, it looks like it. Where's Tess?

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:47.810
She was... I thought she was behind me.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:50.391
- We have to find her.
- Yes, I'm going to.

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:53.090
You have to stay here and you do not
fucking move until I tell you.

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:54.194
Do you understand?

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:56.363
Do you understand? Yes!

01:14:57.368 --> 01:15:00.405
Joey. Joey.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.908
Joey, I've got asilia.
She's in the comms room.

01:15:02.999 --> 01:15:04.359
Do you have eyes on the other one?

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:07.659
That's a negative, boss.

01:15:10.214 --> 01:15:12.375
But I'll keep my eyes open.

01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:14.422
Thank you. Out.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.920
Okay.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:21.506
Okay. That's quite heavy.

01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:48.787
Shit!

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:50.084
Nol

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:54.501
no!

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.376
No need to take you alive.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:06.509
Come on! Grab on, let's go!

01:16:06.604 --> 01:16:07.719
No, no, Sam!

01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:12.021
Run! Back!

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:17.778
Up, now, now, now.

01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:22.285
Come on, get down.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:25.403
Jj

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:38.048
Ooh, no, he's gonna get me.

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:39.875
Ah, he missed.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:41.490
There you are.

01:16:41.514 --> 01:16:42.799
You son of a bitch.

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:48.684
Okay.

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:53.602
Ah... fuck, I'm good.

01:17:11.502 --> 01:17:13.493
Jj

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.171
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Follow me!

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:22.210
Okay.

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:24.920
Okay, when I say go,
you're gonna run to the comms room.

01:17:25.015 --> 01:17:26.971
Right there. It's where asilia is.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.515
- Okay?
- I'm not gonna leave you.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:30.308
You can do it.
You can go, all right?

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:33.604
I'm gonna cover you. Okay?
When I say, go.

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:36.182
- Okay, okay. Yeah.
- Ready? Go.

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:37.562
Okay. Fuck!

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:40.947
Hold on!

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:47.614
Wait, wait, wait...

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:54.794
Shit.

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:58.750
Fucking stupid, Samantha. Fuck.

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:02.917
Jj

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:11.600
All right, now we got an even fight.

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:24.272
Asilia! Are you okay?

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.651
- Where's Sam?
- She's coming.

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:27.904
Get the door. Get the door!

01:18:33.292 --> 01:18:35.283
- Okay. You want help?
- Wait.

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:37.962
What?

01:18:39.506 --> 01:18:41.087
Wait! We can't always be babies.

01:18:41.175 --> 01:18:43.006
We-we can't stay here, we will die.

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:44.879
- I mean, yeah.
- We have to fight.

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.130
You wanna fight?

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.928
I've never fought back in my entire life,

01:18:48.015 --> 01:18:50.552
- but I wanna fucking fight!
- Okay.

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.342
- Okay, you ready?
- Shh.

01:18:57.858 --> 01:18:59.439
Okay.

01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:06.572
Hey, boss. I've got you.

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:10.033
Here, take this.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:15.872
- Moving.
- Covering!

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:21.829
Jj

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:27.845
Okay...

01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:36.845
There's no one else
I would've rather been kidnapped with.

01:19:42.069 --> 01:19:44.526
That's fucked up even for you.

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:46.729
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.406
Me too.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:53.073
Let's do this.

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:56.114
Okay, let's go.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.560
Jj

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:31.114
Shit...

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:37.071
Oh, no. No.

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:41.701
Oh, no...

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:29.502
- You are zalaam's now.
- No!

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:30.753
- Quiet now!
- Let go!

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.445
Jj

01:22:14.388 --> 01:22:16.470
Masakh!

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:21.679
Pata! My brother!

01:22:24.231 --> 01:22:26.392
You're still breathing, ah?

01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:38.529
And you grow some balls.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:42.290
Come.

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:46.158
Come!

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:54.385
Come again.

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:58.386
An?

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:08.354
Come on, man. Huh?

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:24.905
Coward!

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.865
Where was your bravery before,

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.168
when you stood by and watched
your family die, huh?

01:23:44.645 --> 01:23:45.680
Hey...

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.352
Huh?

01:23:47.439 --> 01:23:48.975
Hey?

01:23:50.275 --> 01:23:51.481
Huh?

01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:55.154
Huh?

01:23:57.199 --> 01:24:00.612
We... let you live.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:03.736
We let you live!

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.195
That was no life!

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:17.958
Stay down!

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:21.212
I ook at me.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:25.882
I ook at me.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:31.931
You took everything from me!

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.687
My children's names were...

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:36.902
Tabu...

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:43.117
Josie and Sarah.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:58.750
Now... now, I am a man.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:05.130
I think I saw him over there!

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:06.225
Go...

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.306
This is a good death.

01:25:12.482 --> 01:25:13.642
You did good, brother.

01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:16.516
Your family would be proud.

01:26:14.586 --> 01:26:16.076
Oh, hey, Bo.

01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:20.672
My brother.

01:26:22.344 --> 01:26:23.550
Why don't you pull up a chair?

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:40.855
I clipped a guy over-over there.

01:26:41.863 --> 01:26:44.570
Hey, he dropped his ak.

01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:46.865
You got the strength
to go over there and get it?

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:50.652
Yeah, me neither.

01:26:56.169 --> 01:26:57.249
She's out there.

01:26:57.337 --> 01:27:00.921
Uh, the lion? No.

01:27:01.007 --> 01:27:06.377
No... with the fire
and the-the fighting, no.

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:09.178
There's no way she stayed.

01:27:09.266 --> 01:27:11.507
She doesn't even have a reason.

01:27:13.937 --> 01:27:16.428
Unless she's just mean.

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:24.194
It's justice if she takes us. Huh...

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:27.694
The things we've done
to this world...

01:27:27.784 --> 01:27:29.024
Death...

01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:33.658
So much death.

01:27:35.459 --> 01:27:37.745
These creatures were killed for what?

01:27:40.756 --> 01:27:41.996
Medicine?

01:27:43.008 --> 01:27:44.748
Magic charms?

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:50.637
I don't understand how anyone
would want these animals dead...

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:53.010
Instead of alive.

01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:57.052
For a belief a thousand years old.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.731
I'm ashamed.

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:07.354
Jj

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:11.945
Oh, hi, boys.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:20.333

01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:24.413

Wow.

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:55.072
Well, that happened.

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:02.542
But you were right.
She js still out there.

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:10.918
Jj

01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:25.891
You rest well, you crazy chinaman.

01:29:46.256 --> 01:29:47.587
- What's going on?
- Fuck...

01:29:47.674 --> 01:29:48.789
- Fuck you!
- Come here.

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:52.126
- Shit. Fuck!
- You bitch!

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.428
Fucking... shit!

01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:57.702
I should've known you'd be a handful
when we first got you.

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.262
Fucking Midlands girl, right?

01:29:59.352 --> 01:30:02.185
Fuck you! Murderer! Traitor!

01:30:02.272 --> 01:30:04.809
I'm not a murderer any more
than your government's a murderer.

01:30:05.859 --> 01:30:07.315
Your government, too, dickhead!

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:09.734
Nah. Not anymore. It's not my country.

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:11.424
It never wouldn't wanted me
in the first place

01:30:11.448 --> 01:30:13.188
or anyone in my skin color or religion.

01:30:13.283 --> 01:30:15.239
I don't get to go back home.

01:30:15.327 --> 01:30:18.285
- At least, I'm welcome here.
- 'Cause of what you've done!

01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:19.849
- I haven't even started yet!
- No, no, no, no.

01:30:19.873 --> 01:30:21.704
- Get up! Get up!
- No!

01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:23.247
Get up!

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:25.075
- No, no, no...
- Shut your mouth!

01:30:50.612 --> 01:30:53.649
Hey, baby.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:01.195
Jj

01:31:45.125 --> 01:31:47.036
No, no, no, no, no!

01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:49.834
Let her go. Hey, hey.
She's not the one that you want.

01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:52.207
You're not the one I want, either.

01:31:52.298 --> 01:31:53.708
So no, fuck it.

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.916
I think I might cut her head off.

01:31:56.011 --> 01:31:57.672
- No!
- Real slow!

01:31:57.762 --> 01:32:01.675
Tess, Tess. Hey, hold still.
It's gonna be okay.

01:32:01.766 --> 01:32:04.974
Why the fuck would you say that?
You know it's not gonna be.

01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:07.598
Huh? Shut the fuck up!

01:32:13.069 --> 01:32:15.685
Okay, take me. Okay?

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.065
Are you stupid or something?

01:32:17.157 --> 01:32:19.864
I told you, I want
the governor's daughter!

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:22.408
Now, I know you know where she is.

01:32:22.495 --> 01:32:23.905
So bring her to me.

01:32:23.997 --> 01:32:26.454
Now, if you don't,
you're all gonna die anyway.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:28.748
Including this one. Your choice!

01:32:28.835 --> 01:32:30.871
Ah!

01:32:30.962 --> 01:32:32.953
He's gonna do it.

01:32:34.507 --> 01:32:36.998
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll give her to you.

01:32:37.093 --> 01:32:39.084
Just call off your men,
and you let her go.

01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:43.546
Yeah, two lives for one.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.976
- Fuck!
- Get down on the floor!

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:54.308
Shit.

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:58.270
- Fuck.
- We wait.

01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:05.364
Asilia?

01:33:14.297 --> 01:33:15.628
Asilia?

01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:18.884
Hey.

01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:27.264
Hey, asilia.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:28.762
I fucking told you to stay in...

01:33:32.232 --> 01:33:33.688
I killed a man.

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.184
- I fucking...
- Yes.

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:38.768
- I fucking...
- Okay.

01:33:38.863 --> 01:33:40.569
- I killed a man.
- Yes.

01:33:40.657 --> 01:33:42.238
I know it's hard.

01:33:43.326 --> 01:33:45.567
Just... we can finish this.

01:33:47.038 --> 01:33:49.199
But I need you to listen.
I need you to be strong.

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:53.621
- I have a plan, okay?
- Where is she?

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:54.791
This way, come on.

01:34:14.065 --> 01:34:16.602
Fuck me.

01:34:25.952 --> 01:34:28.193
Well? Where is she?

01:34:29.956 --> 01:34:33.039
She's in the barn.
You can take her easily,

01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.663
and that way she won't know
that it was me.

01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:40.080
Why do you care so much
about what she thinks of you?

01:34:43.303 --> 01:34:45.419
Because I promised her
I would keep her safe.

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:49.222
Oh, yeah? Well, you lied.
Now lead the way.

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:52.350
- Get up!
- Tess, come on.

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:54.719
Come on!

01:35:00.486 --> 01:35:02.477
Why's she so valuable to you, anyway?

01:35:02.572 --> 01:35:05.780
Her father's never gonna give you power.
It doesn't matter what you do to her.

01:35:05.867 --> 01:35:07.698
I want what's owed to me.

01:35:09.454 --> 01:35:11.410
Okay, so what about the caliphate?

01:35:11.497 --> 01:35:14.455
Caliphate? There is no caliphate.

01:35:14.542 --> 01:35:17.534
It's about what it's always about.
It's about money.

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:19.290
Her father stole... don't look at me!

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.587
Her father stole from me! He owes me.

01:35:21.674 --> 01:35:23.960
Okay. So this was all an act.

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:26.714
Would you prefer if I was some zealot?
That's for fools, man.

01:35:28.223 --> 01:35:31.636
Her father deals in the exact
same ivory trade as we do.

01:35:31.726 --> 01:35:33.762
Lion parts, rhino horns.

01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:37.220
Even this place, he owns it.
Part of his business...

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:39.180
Breeding lions to shoot for profit.

01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:44.351
It's a great cover story, innit?

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:47.147
The fact is, everything has a value...

01:35:47.242 --> 01:35:50.530
Animals, humans.

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:52.901
He has the highest kill count
in the whole of the country,

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:54.071
and he plays dirty.

01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:57.202
But don't worry, I can play dirty, too.
You get me?

01:35:57.293 --> 01:35:59.830
Yeah, okay.
She's in there, I told her to hide.

01:35:59.921 --> 01:36:01.732
You can just go in
and make it look like you found her.

01:36:01.756 --> 01:36:04.088
Are you trying to take me
for some dickhead or something?

01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:06.712
You think I'm dumb, going in there alone?

01:36:06.803 --> 01:36:08.509
You first.

01:36:10.807 --> 01:36:12.672
Let Tess go.

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:16.309
You don't need her.

01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:18.512
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Go.

01:36:19.857 --> 01:36:21.063
Lead the way.

01:36:23.319 --> 01:36:25.856
You can come out now, asilia.

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:34.156
So where is she?

01:36:34.247 --> 01:36:35.247
Run, now.

01:36:37.667 --> 01:36:39.658
Jj

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:43.331
Hey, girls.

01:36:43.423 --> 01:36:44.708
I ook what I found.

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:47.965
What, you think that scares me?

01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:50.043
I told you, I'm fucking bad man out here.

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:52.049
I've got the gun. I've got the power.

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.631
Actually, I don't think either of us do.

01:37:08.489 --> 01:37:10.320
So now you have a choice.

01:37:12.327 --> 01:37:14.568
Which bitch is gonna kill you?

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:19.614
I swear one of us will.

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:22.371
Well, then, you die first.

01:38:12.095 --> 01:38:14.928
All hail the queen.

01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:24.220
Put it down, Tess. Put it down.

01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:35.736
Yeah. Go, ho-ho.

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:37.818
Jj

01:38:49.799 --> 01:38:51.039
Oh, my god.

01:38:59.642 --> 01:39:01.758
All she wanted was to protect her cubs.

01:39:04.147 --> 01:39:06.467
And that's why she stayed behind
and the rest of them left.

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:10.437
She reminds me of someone I know.

01:39:13.614 --> 01:39:15.024
Hey, what am I, chopped liver?

01:39:15.116 --> 01:39:16.822
Hey, you did okay.

01:39:16.909 --> 01:39:18.490
- I mean, for a guy.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:39:18.578 --> 01:39:20.443
- Or did you want a hug?
- No, no.

01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:22.950
- Maybe you do.
- Oh, oh. I got issues. Oh.

01:39:26.127 --> 01:39:28.038
Ooh.

01:39:28.129 --> 01:39:29.619
Oh, that hurt. Ow.

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.793
Jj

01:39:54.614 --> 01:39:56.605
Jj
