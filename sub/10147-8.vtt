01:12.240 --> 01:14.659
{933931

01:19.580 --> 01:21.582
You overfed, miserable moneybags!

01:21.666 --> 01:23.376
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

01:23.459 --> 01:25.836
You hear that?
He needs some manners.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.755
What he really needs
is a bigger boat.

01:37.056 --> 01:39.100
- Who are they?
- Is this a show?

01:42.186 --> 01:43.813
Flight right and charge!

01:46.816 --> 01:48.109
Get out of here.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.968
Mine's bigger than yours.

02:14.051 --> 02:17.179
All the money in the world
and not an ounce of refinement.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.105
Your jewels, your watches.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.607
Please, be so kind
as to turn them over to us.

02:28.691 --> 02:30.359
And no cheap heroics.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.832
Definitely something weird
going on over there.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.666
<i>People dressed up
like playing cards.</i>

02:45.750 --> 02:47.335
Did you say playing cards?

02:47.418 --> 02:49.712
Uh-huh. They travel
in your circles?

02:49.795 --> 02:51.130
<i>I'm afraid so.</i>

02:51.213 --> 02:53.466
Well, guess I better
go introduce myself.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.762
No, please!

02:57.845 --> 03:00.139
Come on. You'll have
another one soon enough.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.724
You won't have to steal for it.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.185
Yeah, she earns hers
the old-fashioned way.

03:04.268 --> 03:05.268
Hey!

03:19.116 --> 03:20.618
Time to go, I'd say.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.122
Sorry, love. This is why
I came back to Gotham.

03:46.268 --> 03:49.730
Who's it going to be?
My husband or all these passengers?

03:58.781 --> 04:01.534
Everyone! Into the life boat!

04:01.617 --> 04:02.952
<i>Everything all right there?</i>

04:03.035 --> 04:05.371
Fine. Perfect.
Except they got away.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.081
<i>We'd better reconvene.</i>

04:07.164 --> 04:08.517
<i>You should know
who you're dealing with.</i>

04:08.541 --> 04:10.876
Be there when I can.
I'm late for an appointment.

04:12.628 --> 04:13.963
But I need to talk to you.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.729
Dana, sorry I'm late.
I got stuck in...

04:30.813 --> 04:33.315
What are you apologizing for?
I wasn't expecting you.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.151
But... I... But...

04:35.234 --> 04:36.944
How many times
has it been now, Terry?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.946
After a while, a girl gets the idea.

04:39.572 --> 04:41.198
No. You got it all wrong!

04:42.074 --> 04:43.159
Do I?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.918
It's not like I wanna be late.

04:53.002 --> 04:56.130
It's just that
I've got these responsibilities.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.339
Sure you do.

04:57.423 --> 04:58.442
Look, if you can't handle it,

04:58.466 --> 04:59.776
maybe we should just
forget the whole thing.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.760
Terry, I already have forgotten it.

05:12.897 --> 05:14.106
Big fight?

05:16.817 --> 05:17.902
I was watching.

05:22.114 --> 05:25.075
I got this...
this after school job.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.703
It takes up a lot of my time.
Too much.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.997
Maybe you should ask your boss
for more time off.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.917
Not this guy.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.793
Him you don't ask for time off.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.879
So, what kinda after school job
is this, anyway?

05:37.338 --> 05:39.798
Well, I do errands...
Sort of.

05:39.882 --> 05:43.219
It's kinda hard to describe.
What about you?

05:43.302 --> 05:45.030
What were you doing out there?
How come you didn't go in?

05:45.054 --> 05:46.722
- Didn't know anyone.
- New in town?

05:46.931 --> 05:48.599
Perpetually.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.311
My parents move around a lot,
'cause of work.

05:52.394 --> 05:53.896
At least you get to see
the world.

05:53.979 --> 05:57.066
Yeah, see the world
and lose all your friends.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.277
You know what it's like
being uprooted every few weeks?

06:00.361 --> 06:02.988
Never quite knowing
what's gonna be happening next?

06:03.072 --> 06:05.574
I'm beginning to get an idea
of what that's like.

06:05.658 --> 06:08.452
Two of a kind.
That's what we are.

06:08.536 --> 06:11.789
I'm Melanie. Melanie Walker.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.915
Terry McGinnis.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.837
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.257
It's... just kinda quick,
that's all.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.050
With me, it's always been
now or never.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.468
Ever consider later?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.929
How much later?

06:27.012 --> 06:28.764
I could see you tomorrow night.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.607
- That'd be great.
- Where can I pick you up?

06:30.641 --> 06:33.102
Um, better not.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.813
Why don't we just meet
right here tomorrow at midnight?

06:36.272 --> 06:37.982
Under the big clock.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.108
I'll be here.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.624
You're late. Dana again?

06:55.708 --> 06:58.335
That's all over now.
Thanks to you and this job.

06:58.419 --> 07:01.797
Don't dramatize. You two will be
back together soon enough.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.483
And in the meantime,
we've got to figure out

07:03.507 --> 07:04.675
how to stop this gang.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.885
I gave 'em a lot more
than they expected.

07:06.969 --> 07:08.679
- They're gone.
- They'll be back.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.347
We've got history, they and I.

07:10.431 --> 07:12.933
The Royal Flush Gang
has been around a long time.

07:13.017 --> 07:14.518
<i>They're a family.</i>

07:14.602 --> 07:17.229
<i>They bring in new members,
sons, daughters, husbands,</i>

07:17.313 --> 07:20.107
<i>wives, as the older ones
retire or go to prison.</i>

07:20.190 --> 07:21.950
<i>They think they're better
than everyone else.</i>

07:22.151 --> 07:23.569
<i>The Aristocrats of Crime.</i>

07:33.537 --> 07:35.205
You're acting like children.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.042
If you'd been pros,
Batman would be dead now.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.878
We got away with the jewels!
What difference does it make?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.630
I'll tell you the difference.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.465
Years ago, when I was your age,

07:44.548 --> 07:46.425
he broke up this gang
for a while.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.470
He outsmarted us. Humiliated us.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.889
And I've been waiting years
to pay him back.

07:51.972 --> 07:56.852
Ah, the old revenge game.
But tell me something, sire.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.646
How's that gonna make us
any richer?

08:01.440 --> 08:04.443
All right. We've gotta start
planning the next one.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.236
- Where's Ten?
- Right here.

08:30.177 --> 08:33.055
- How are you doing?
- Just a few more wires.

08:33.138 --> 08:36.892
Be thorough, Ten. We have
all the time in the world.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.563
Yeah, right.

08:50.406 --> 08:51.490
You're sure about this?

08:51.573 --> 08:54.952
Everything they steal
is tied to playing card suits.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.288
And the earliest European cards
had swords, not spades.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.456
<i>How does the yacht fit in?</i>

08:59.540 --> 09:00.833
<i>It was part of a yacht club.</i>

09:00.916 --> 09:01.916
Ouch!

09:05.421 --> 09:07.756
- Okay, alarm's off.
- You're sure?

09:07.840 --> 09:10.634
I'm sure.
Now, can we get this over with?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.206
Hold it right there!

09:51.383 --> 09:52.885
All the time in the world.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.213
You don't look so royal now.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.815
All right! Everyone, hands up!

11:42.202 --> 11:44.705
It appears
we've been dealt a wild card.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.166
If you value his welfare,
I suggest you not follow.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.595
Looks like a clean getaway.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.179
Think so?

12:04.308 --> 12:05.684
- Drop him.
- What?

12:07.019 --> 12:09.646
- You can't do that.
- Of course I can.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.190
You heard, what I said!
Drop him!

12:12.274 --> 12:13.442
Sorry, gramps.

12:28.707 --> 12:32.502
Don't ever argue with me again.

12:42.846 --> 12:45.557
- Oh! My leg!
- Come on.

12:45.641 --> 12:46.725
I'll get you to a hospital.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.528
- What is it?
- Nothing.

13:39.611 --> 13:42.155
Come on, something's
bothering you. I can tell.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.366
It's my family.

13:44.574 --> 13:47.619
I... I think
we're gonna be moving again.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.413
- How soon?
- Real soon.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.583
A month? A week?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.044
I don't wanna think that far ahead.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.546
Live for the moment, you know?

14:00.632 --> 14:02.759
- Can I see you tomorrow night?
- Sure.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.469
But don't you mean tonight?

14:09.433 --> 14:11.101
Tonight, then.

14:11.435 --> 14:13.228
Same place, same time?

14:13.562 --> 14:15.063
Be there.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.785
Late again.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.912
Or early, depending
on how you look at it.

14:30.996 --> 14:33.749
How I look at it is,
the Gang's gonna hit again.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.727
And we've only got a few hours
to figure out where.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.711
You're sure it'll be tonight?

14:37.794 --> 14:39.588
You've got something
better to do?

14:39.671 --> 14:42.007
- Yeah, I do.
- This is getting tiresome.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.801
Look, if you had any proof
they were gonna try

14:44.885 --> 14:46.485
something tonight,
it would be different!

14:46.595 --> 14:49.306
But I'm not gonna change
my plans because of a hunch.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.389
Batman would.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.143
Hey, I put my life
on the line all the time.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.312
One night's
not gonna make any difference!

14:56.855 --> 14:58.940
One night always
makes the difference!

14:59.024 --> 15:00.442
I know what it is.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.236
You can't stand to see anyone
going out and having a life.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.989
You want me
to end up like you. Alone.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.898
How many times
do I have to tell you?

15:17.959 --> 15:19.836
There's no room for mistakes
in this business!

15:19.920 --> 15:21.755
You've got to keep focused.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.840
- You haven't!
- What?

15:23.924 --> 15:27.677
This thing you've got for Batman,
you're making us take stupid risks.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.346
We're gonna get nailed.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.558
No one disrespects me or this family.
Not for long, anyway.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.895
And if you can't get behind
that, you might as well leave.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.146
Amen to that!

15:42.859 --> 15:44.319
Ten!

15:46.488 --> 15:47.488
Melanie!

15:49.282 --> 15:51.118
This family's taken
good care of us,

15:51.201 --> 15:53.245
and it's always going to be there.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.288
But why would you want
to throw that away?

15:55.497 --> 15:57.207
A... A boy.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.127
- Love. Great.
- It is.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.963
Melanie, men come and go.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.340
Most of 'em
cause nothing but trouble.

16:05.423 --> 16:06.800
Some of them are worth it.

16:06.883 --> 16:10.095
But not one is worth the
sacrifice you're about to make.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.888
You don't know this one.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.850
You didn't see fit
to introduce us to him.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.394
That's because you knew
he wouldn't fit in, right?

16:19.396 --> 16:21.314
Someday the right one
will come along.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.151
One who will fit in.
He'll be your king.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.778
You'll have all the money
you want. All the freedom.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.072
The very finest life can offer.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.992
But only if you
stick with this family.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.160
Well?

16:38.582 --> 16:40.208
- Melanie?
<i>- Terry.</i>

16:40.292 --> 16:41.877
<i>I... I can't see you tonight.</i>

16:42.085 --> 16:44.004
Something come up?
School work?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.839
<i>- No.
- Then what is it?</i>

16:45.922 --> 16:48.175
I... I can't see you again.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.594
- Even
<i>- Why?</i>

16:50.677 --> 16:53.972
It just didn't work out.
I gotta go now.

16:54.306 --> 16:56.683
Melanie, there's something
wrong, isn't there? Tell me.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.645
There's nothing wrong.
Nothing. Goodbye, Terry.

17:16.828 --> 17:18.496
Computer. Cross reference address.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.461
Floor plan.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.140
No.

17:51.488 --> 17:55.116
We did it! Cash cards!
Plastic gold!

17:56.826 --> 17:59.496
Now I can actually
buy some diamonds.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.748
Well, what's wrong?
You look almost disappointed.

18:01.831 --> 18:05.335
No Batman. I had a special card
just for him.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.837
Hey! We've had a visitor!

18:07.921 --> 18:09.005
Spread out.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.174
You stay here.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.671
I knew you wouldn't disappoint me.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.392
Ten! Come get me!

19:46.102 --> 19:47.395
What are you waiting for?

19:47.479 --> 19:50.065
Don't do it. Just go.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.206
I don't suppose I could
convince you to let me go?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.104
Mr. Wayne.

20:29.187 --> 20:31.147
Those things I said...

20:31.231 --> 20:32.732
I'm sorry.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.818
This kinda thing ever happen to you?

20:36.319 --> 20:39.322
Let me tell you about
a woman named Selina Kyle.
