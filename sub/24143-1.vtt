00:15.000 --> 00:18.833
Might feel a bit hot initially.
Here we go.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.542
But the market in general
is just out of control.

00:41.833 --> 00:45.369
All these poor schmucks
buying apartments

00:45.381 --> 00:48.167
at crazy prices. It's just nuts.

00:48.458 --> 00:54.292
And the banks are just approving
more and more mortgages.

00:54.583 --> 00:58.000
<i>So... yeah.</i>

00:58.292 --> 01:04.417
It's wild. One-bedroom apartments
selling for almost 400.000 euros.

01:04.708 --> 01:06.958
It's insane.
It is insane.

01:07.250 --> 01:11.167
It really is.
Price levels are just crazy right now.

01:12.458 --> 01:16.792
Lean back a little.
There we go. Perfect.

01:18.292 --> 01:21.958
What shampoo do you use?

01:23.500 --> 01:28.333
Not sure. Don't even know if they
sell it in Sweden. Glizz or something.

01:28.625 --> 01:32.625
You've heard about the market,
now that you're back in Stockholm?

01:32.917 --> 01:35.083
Market is going up, UP, UP-

01:35.375 --> 01:39.667
The market goes up in fits.
First it goes up.

01:39.958 --> 01:44.000
Then down, but not as much
as it went up, then up again.

01:44.292 --> 01:47.625
Interest rates go up,
mortgage payments...

01:47.917 --> 01:51.625
They're forced to sell.
And all these first-time buyers.

01:51.917 --> 01:56.083
Without wealthy parents,
you're pretty much screwed.

02:47.292 --> 02:53.375
THE REAL ESTATE

04:46.417 --> 04:50.833
He had a hard life,
but he made it to 97 years of age.

04:55.125 --> 05:00.750
This will hang over the entrance
of his bridge club...

05:01.042 --> 05:03.125
Eventually.

05:04.792 --> 05:07.375
He was a very good friend.

05:08.625 --> 05:12.250
A client... and a father.

05:13.667 --> 05:17.625
A real estate owner
with a social conscience.

05:18.875 --> 05:24.542
Nojet, now it's up to you.
Now you take over.

05:24.833 --> 05:31.917
As your dad's lawyer, I want to tell you
I'm grateful you came to me.

05:32.208 --> 05:36.000
And that you want to continue
on your father's path.

05:37.125 --> 05:39.667
That makes me very happy.

05:39.958 --> 05:46.083
And I've said on numerous occasions
that this won't be easy...

05:47.917 --> 05:50.375
What did you say?

05:50.667 --> 05:52.583
His dad.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.500
What did you say?

05:59.417 --> 06:01.833
Your dad?
Yes.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.208
He wasn't exactly your dad.

06:07.542 --> 06:08.875
What's that?

06:10.417 --> 06:15.375
Are we still the managers
of the building or what?

06:15.667 --> 06:18.875
Nothing's set in stone.
I know nothing right now.

06:19.167 --> 06:21.083
Nothing.

06:21.375 --> 06:25.625
I just want to play this game of bridge,
then we'll see.

06:29.542 --> 06:34.083
I don't know.
We'll see what happens.

06:34.375 --> 06:37.750
I want to thank him my own way.

06:38.042 --> 06:42.083
Friendship through actions,

06:42.375 --> 06:45.958
forever keep him in grateful memory.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.250
Thank you.

06:48.542 --> 06:52.042
What about the other unit?

06:52.333 --> 06:55.792
Laserbridge.
You just shoot.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.792
Okay. Don't know what that is.

06:59.083 --> 07:02.500
It's a game. Packed every day.

07:02.792 --> 07:04.500
Laserbridge.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.207
Hello.
I just wanted to introduce myself.

08:38.292 --> 08:41.457
I own the building.
I inherited it.

08:42.957 --> 08:46.375
It's nice to meet some tenants.

08:46.667 --> 08:49.833
Put a face to them.

08:50.125 --> 08:53.708
I understand if I'm bothering you.

08:56.625 --> 08:58.833
Did you ever meet my dad?

09:00.417 --> 09:04.333
Yes. It's my building.

09:12.542 --> 09:14.583
Put a face to the tenants...

09:16.125 --> 09:18.125
That would be nice.

09:22.333 --> 09:25.583
Right...
There's a problem with the contracts.

09:27.458 --> 09:31.333
I understand there are some problems
with the leases.

09:32.458 --> 09:35.708
Yes, that's the way it is.

09:36.833 --> 09:40.042
It's all fucking shit.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.583
Hello. Sorry to bother you.

09:48.875 --> 09:52.917
I'm your landlord, and I've got
a few questions for you.

09:53.208 --> 09:56.125
I'm the owner of the building.

09:56.417 --> 09:58.750
Right.
May I come in?

09:59.042 --> 10:01.000
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

10:03.667 --> 10:08.417
I'd like to have a
look at your contract.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.917
I'm renting this place.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.792
You don't have a contract?

10:15.333 --> 10:19.875
This is a sublet? Or are you renting
from the person it's sublet to?

10:20.167 --> 10:21.417
Yes.

10:21.708 --> 10:25.292
How did you get this place?
Online.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.458
Online?
I saw an ad.

10:27.750 --> 10:31.583
I didn't have a place to live,
so I looked around...

10:32.875 --> 10:36.333
Oh, that's too bad.
Something wrong?

10:40.500 --> 10:42.167
<i>No, but...</i>

10:43.917 --> 10:45.833
Your daughter?
Yes?

10:46.125 --> 10:48.708
Any idea how she got this contract?

10:49.000 --> 10:53.375
Yeah, through a friend... of hers.

10:53.667 --> 10:56.750
Someone.
Don't really know who, but...

10:57.917 --> 11:01.208
They tipped her off. Yeah...

11:01.500 --> 11:04.583
Great tip!
Yes, it was.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.917
Good friend.
Yes...

11:07.208 --> 11:09.542
It's a nice place.
Yes, it is.

11:09.833 --> 11:14.250
Do you know if she had
to pay for the contract?

11:14.542 --> 11:17.417
Yes, because I lent her some cash.

11:17.708 --> 11:20.292
That's a nice Mommy!
Yes...

11:20.583 --> 11:23.958
As you should be.
If you have the possibility...

11:28.375 --> 11:33.333
There are two names on the door.
One of them is definitely not Swedish.

11:33.625 --> 11:36.625
Where's your husband from?
Estonia.

11:36.917 --> 11:40.042
How long has he been in Stockholm?
Or in Sweden?

11:41.167 --> 11:45.417
He's been here for nine years.
Nine years...

11:45.708 --> 11:49.250
Who lives there?
I see there's a bed there.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.083
My son.
How old is he?

11:54.667 --> 11:57.125
He's nine.

11:57.417 --> 12:03.750
Okay. So you had him right after
the guy came here from Estonia?

12:04.042 --> 12:06.833
Or maybe that's why he came here?

12:07.125 --> 12:10.625
I don't understand why that's relevant.

12:10.917 --> 12:15.458
Maybe it's a digression,
but maybe I'm trying to get to know you.

12:15.750 --> 12:18.208
You live in my building, after all.

12:19.375 --> 12:22.625
Did you ever meet Chris?

13:09.292 --> 13:12.625
Hi.
I need to come inside.

13:12.917 --> 13:16.875
What?
Let me in.

13:18.750 --> 13:23.000
Sit down. I'm just going
to get something to drink.

13:25.625 --> 13:27.333
Want a Bloody Mary?
No thanks.

13:28.583 --> 13:32.875
I'm good.
No worries, I'll go solo, as usual.

13:56.750 --> 14:00.417
I was out looking,
ringing every damn doorbell.

14:00.708 --> 14:03.250
To see if I could talk to someone.

14:03.542 --> 14:08.375
A few of them opened, but of course
they didn't have any contracts.

14:08.667 --> 14:13.542
Shifty eyes, excuses,
"my husband knows where it is."

14:13.833 --> 14:17.000
"It's probably in the safe-deposit box."

14:17.292 --> 14:21.000
But you must have all the leases.

14:21.292 --> 14:25.000
Where are they?
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:25.292 --> 14:29.167
Who signed those leases?
I did.

14:29.458 --> 14:33.750
You haven't made money off those
leases? What about your dad?

14:38.708 --> 14:41.875
Because those contracts
are worth a lot of money.

14:42.167 --> 14:44.833
I'm not stupid.
I've been abroad,

14:45.125 --> 14:50.708
but I know these illegal sublets
generate a lot of cash.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.792
Yeah, we haven't...

14:53.083 --> 14:58.167
We've done everything by the book.

14:58.458 --> 15:02.083
We've been going by the waiting list.

15:02.375 --> 15:08.875
So the 7th floor is all waiting list?

15:11.583 --> 15:17.750
Chris, these people got their leases
under the table from someone.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.958
A middle-man made money off them.

15:25.875 --> 15:30.333
It's insane. The building is
being so poorly managed.

15:32.708 --> 15:36.375
It's so poorly managed,
it's so run down by now.

15:36.667 --> 15:39.000
And it was supposed to be your job.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.000
But the thing is, you...

15:51.292 --> 15:55.583
The truth <i>is...</i>
you only think about yourself.

15:59.167 --> 16:03.208
You have to respect the work I do.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.875
That's all there is to it. Right?

16:10.500 --> 16:14.625
You have to understand what it's like

16:14.917 --> 16:19.042
to live for these people,
I mean the tenants and stuff.

16:19.333 --> 16:26.250
They don't have a ton of money in their
bank accounts, they are struggling...

16:26.542 --> 16:29.375
Forget that for a second.
Students...

16:29.667 --> 16:32.167
Single mothers...

16:32.458 --> 16:34.625
Can you just drop...
immigrants.

16:34.917 --> 16:41.042
Forget all that for one second...
I can't. It's about ideals.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.833
Want a drink?
No, thanks.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.583
Maybe chill a little?
<i>I...</i>

16:45.875 --> 16:48.042
Chill out!

18:56.417 --> 18:59.792
You're not going to your hotel.
You're homeless.

19:21.125 --> 19:24.125
I need to talk to you.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.917
Can you hear me?

19:27.208 --> 19:31.542
Hello?
Lex, I need to talk to you.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.875
Lex, I just need two seconds!

19:38.167 --> 19:43.125
Don't interrupt me
in the middle of rehearsal.

19:43.417 --> 19:46.500
What do you want?
Lex, what do you think?

19:46.792 --> 19:50.375
Is it working?
Good. Very good.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.208
Raise your arms toward the sky.

19:53.500 --> 19:57.000
That's important.
Gold raining from the sky.

19:57.292 --> 20:01.042
Seize the opportunity.
Raise your arms!

20:01.333 --> 20:04.250
That's <i>it...</i>
Get your arms up.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.625
That's it, that's great!
You're receiving.

20:12.917 --> 20:18.000
Here comes the money. It's falling.
Good! Collecting it with one hand.

20:21.333 --> 20:24.583
Spread your legs in the sack

20:24.875 --> 20:27.583
and find a synchronized rhythm.

20:33.125 --> 20:35.542
Know what I'm saying?

20:35.833 --> 20:38.917
Right, your options.

20:39.208 --> 20:41.042
You have two right now.

20:42.292 --> 20:47.625
Either you keep the building,
and keep on receiving a monthly payment.

20:47.917 --> 20:51.458
Right. Or I put it on the market.
Exactly.

20:53.958 --> 20:59.417
You'd have to turn it around quickly.
And you wouldn't have a buyer in mind?

20:59.708 --> 21:04.708
Why do I have to turn it around quickly?
I want to, but why do I have to?

21:05.000 --> 21:08.917
Otherwise the tenants will have time
to form a co-op.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.458
And if they're successful,

21:11.750 --> 21:16.000
any buyer is irrelevant -
they've got right of first refusal.

21:16.292 --> 21:19.292
If they turn the building into a co-op,

21:19.583 --> 21:23.708
you'd be unable to sell
for the next couple of years.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.667
Okay.

21:25.958 --> 21:29.458
This building is a hard sell,
no doubt. It's run down,

21:29.750 --> 21:36.167
heavily mortgaged, and badly managed.

21:36.458 --> 21:40.583
And I don't suppose
you've got a buyer lined up?

21:40.875 --> 21:44.417
No.
Right. I might have one.

21:44.708 --> 21:47.792
I'll put you in touch with him.

21:48.083 --> 21:51.458
We'll see what he says.
See if we can get an offer.

21:51.750 --> 21:54.750
You trust him?
Yeah, <i>I...</i>

21:55.042 --> 22:00.958
Doesn't matter. If he puts down
the money and buys it, then he does.

22:01.250 --> 22:05.542
So... it's not about trust.

22:05.833 --> 22:08.542
You need a quick turnaround.
That's it.

22:12.667 --> 22:15.042
One, two, three, four, five, six...

22:15.333 --> 22:19.375
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Times twelve, that's 72.

22:19.667 --> 22:22.083
How many in the annex?

22:22.375 --> 22:25.542
I don't know.
We'll see when we get there.

22:25.833 --> 22:29.750
But that's a good number...
So total number of units...?

22:30.042 --> 22:35.375
A bit unclear. But 72 sounds like
a great number, right?

22:35.667 --> 22:37.958
Great. Yes.
Well, then.

22:38.250 --> 22:43.125
These are questions I can't answer.
This was the last building Dad bought.

22:43.417 --> 22:46.167
I wasn't even in Sweden at the time.

22:46.458 --> 22:51.542
Were you and your dad close?
Very, but we didn't see each other much.

22:51.833 --> 22:54.458
You never talked business?
No.

22:54.750 --> 22:59.292
He didn't think I needed to occupy
my little girl's head with it.

22:59.583 --> 23:03.000
The idea is for me to take over.

23:03.292 --> 23:08.167
But let's just say I'm
not super excited.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.667
Did I hear a sales pitch?

23:10.958 --> 23:13.708
You bet.
Right, I figured.

23:14.833 --> 23:18.333
These are totally unnecessary.
Just get rid of them.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.042
It's all just junk anyway.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.542
What does this say?

23:24.833 --> 23:26.875
"Unit belonging to..."

23:28.167 --> 23:31.542
A lot of storage.
So much storage.

23:31.833 --> 23:35.833
Do they pay extra rent for these?
It's included, I think.

23:36.125 --> 23:40.875
That's even worse.
Hey, I didn't get a list of tenants.

23:41.167 --> 23:45.167
No, but that can be obtained, obviously.

23:45.458 --> 23:50.292
Right, but it's pretty crucial.
Are there a lot of "immies" here?

23:50.583 --> 23:53.792
"Immies"?
Yeah, I mean... immigrants.

23:54.083 --> 23:57.417
How many Swedes
versus foreigners live here?

23:57.708 --> 24:01.083
Haven't got the faintest idea.

24:01.375 --> 24:06.458
No idea, but what does it matter
as long as they pay the rent?

24:06.750 --> 24:11.417
Maybe it makes no difference to you,
but there's a huge difference.

24:14.917 --> 24:17.833
One square meter...
That's not a lot.

24:18.125 --> 24:20.500
It's not a lot, no.
Right.

24:24.833 --> 24:29.375
Is there some sort of sewage leak?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.125
Nice, right?

24:38.792 --> 24:42.000
Hey? Are you here?

24:47.583 --> 24:49.583
Just looking around a little.

24:53.583 --> 24:55.542
He's asking why you're here.

24:55.833 --> 24:58.542
This is my brother.
Pleasure.

24:58.833 --> 25:00.875
He manages the building.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.125
Run along now.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.208
Shall we continue?

25:18.458 --> 25:20.042
Hello?

25:22.417 --> 25:26.750
Hello? Come in.
This is breaking and entering.

25:27.042 --> 25:28.875
You need permission.

25:29.167 --> 25:31.042
For what? It's my building.

25:31.333 --> 25:34.875
You can't just walk in.
I own it. You wanted to see.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.958
Yes, that's the main thing.

25:38.458 --> 25:40.958
Are they all to this same standard?

25:41.250 --> 25:43.208
I don't actually know.

25:46.667 --> 25:49.458
Not exactly a smorgasbord...

25:51.250 --> 25:54.625
This is great.
Tear it out, raise the rent.

25:56.458 --> 25:59.333
It's actually much better
than I thought.

26:00.833 --> 26:03.417
Definitely.
Better than I thought.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.042
This was my father's dream.

26:09.292 --> 26:14.042
There was always talk about
what he would do with it.

26:21.708 --> 26:24.917
Are there any others?
What do you mean?

26:26.583 --> 26:28.917
You're the sole heir?
Sole...

26:29.208 --> 26:35.750
Mom brought one son into the nest.
That's how you say it, right?

26:36.042 --> 26:39.542
She was previously married.
He's my bonus brother.

26:39.833 --> 26:43.417
He's a stepchild.
I'm constantly about to sneeze.

26:44.917 --> 26:47.333
One stepchild.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.375
Any other buildings?

26:51.667 --> 26:53.542
No.

26:53.833 --> 26:56.042
None?
If I own any other ones?

26:56.333 --> 26:59.208
Your father, the family <i>or...</i>

26:59.500 --> 27:01.500
First off, my father's dead.

27:01.792 --> 27:04.250
That's why we're here.
Is that so?

27:26.250 --> 27:29.417
It's not that easy <i>to...</i>

27:29.708 --> 27:32.417
You know, these things...

27:32.708 --> 27:35.292
In Korea they use these as dildos.

27:35.583 --> 27:40.833
Use a knife and fork.
No. I like using chopsticks.

27:41.125 --> 27:44.458
You look so good and efficient doing it.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.292
How about you shut up now?
Cheers.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.833
You're so unromantic and boring.

27:51.292 --> 27:53.125
Too formal for you?

27:56.208 --> 27:58.417
What's your life like?

28:01.708 --> 28:05.875
I live fairly close to the water.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.167
I don't own a house.

28:10.458 --> 28:14.000
But I've got a totally
fabulous apartment.

28:15.375 --> 28:18.417
And so I get <i>up...</i>

28:18.708 --> 28:21.208
...whenever I feel like it, go out.

28:22.458 --> 28:29.083
I sit down with a newspaper, which
of course is in Spanish, unfortunately.

28:30.292 --> 28:34.375
And my Spanish is pretty limited, still.

28:35.500 --> 28:41.042
I can read, I can understand
roughly what it's about.

28:41.333 --> 28:45.542
And I tell myself,
if I read it each and every morning

28:45.833 --> 28:50.708
my Spanish will eventually improve.
I've told myself that for 20 years.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.208
Got any kids?
No.

28:55.167 --> 28:58.833
Thank God.
And unfortunately not.

28:59.125 --> 29:01.167
You?
When did you leave Sweden?

29:02.500 --> 29:04.542
Some 25 years ago.

29:05.833 --> 29:10.375
I wasn't supposed to leave,
but I fell in love, obviously.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.875
Obviously.
Madly in love.

29:13.167 --> 29:17.500
With some... Toreador?
Pretty much.

29:21.917 --> 29:25.667
And <i>so... I</i> ended up staying there.

29:25.958 --> 29:28.750
Then I came home for a bit.

29:29.042 --> 29:33.667
And I realized it was pretty scary,
coming home.

29:33.958 --> 29:40.667
People were judging you.
"So, what have you been up to?"

29:40.958 --> 29:44.958
"Does being away
make you special in some way?"

29:45.250 --> 29:48.125
I was so young, so <i>I...</i>
That's so Swedish.

29:48.417 --> 29:52.167
Exactly.
Ridiculed for coming back.

29:52.458 --> 29:57.125
Pretty much.
So I just left again, and went back.

29:57.417 --> 30:01.625
Then I lived with a guy for...
seven years, I think.

30:03.083 --> 30:06.458
And it was great.
Super cute.

30:06.750 --> 30:09.750
Is there a man in your life now?
No.

30:10.042 --> 30:14.792
And what's sad is that
we never had any kids.

30:15.083 --> 30:17.458
You regret it?

30:17.750 --> 30:20.000
Now I kind of do, yes.

30:20.292 --> 30:23.917
But I also like that
I'm only responsible for myself.

30:24.208 --> 30:28.542
Of course it's still sad, somehow.

33:47.083 --> 33:49.917
I'm home free.

33:50.208 --> 33:54.958
I'm home free. Home free!

33:55.250 --> 33:59.542
Home free. In Swedish,
that means "without a home."

36:00.625 --> 36:02.458
How did you find me here?

36:04.000 --> 36:08.208
The hotel told you I was here?
Okay. I see...

36:11.167 --> 36:13.792
Want to talk about the building? Okay.

36:14.917 --> 36:17.000
I'm selling.

36:19.583 --> 36:23.958
I can... Seriously,
I'm not going to fix it up.

36:25.083 --> 36:27.583
No. I can't be bothered.

36:27.875 --> 36:30.292
I've seen it.
I don't care about it.

36:33.583 --> 36:37.417
Chris can get another job.
Yes, he can!

36:37.708 --> 36:40.167
People get new jobs all the time.

36:45.625 --> 36:50.792
I get that this is hard for you.
But this is what's going to happen.

36:57.042 --> 37:00.167
I'm sorry, but I can't hold on to it.

37:00.458 --> 37:02.542
I have to sell.

37:12.500 --> 37:15.208
Cut it out.
I won't fall for it.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.708
But you know what you should do?

37:19.458 --> 37:24.667
I don't feel good about it,
but I'm going to sell.

37:24.958 --> 37:31.417
Shoot me an email with all your
questions, queries, thoughts, whatever.

37:35.708 --> 37:38.208
Unfortunately, that's the way it is.

37:47.083 --> 37:51.500
I think we should handle this via email.

38:25.833 --> 38:28.208
Please, Michael!
Can you leave?

38:38.917 --> 38:41.875
This is a soft-boiled egg.

38:42.167 --> 38:44.917
But this is a hard-boiled egg.
Yes?

38:45.208 --> 38:48.000
How can they be different?

38:48.292 --> 38:53.875
You got it from the seven-minute basket.
Sure you got it from the right basket?

38:54.167 --> 38:58.667
We have two baskets next to each other.
They're from the same one.

39:45.125 --> 39:47.542
Could just be tension.

39:47.833 --> 39:49.917
<i>Okay...</i>

39:52.042 --> 39:54.458
Must be in your head.

39:56.875 --> 39:59.000
Take a deep breath.

40:02.625 --> 40:04.333
The back.

40:05.542 --> 40:07.375
Breathe, breathe.

41:05.375 --> 41:08.375
Hey. I want to talk to you.
You know...

41:08.667 --> 41:10.667
Angry.
It's not okay.

41:10.958 --> 41:13.000
Very angry.
Not okay.

41:13.292 --> 41:16.458
The third time!
You're the one taking them down.

41:16.750 --> 41:18.042
But Why?

41:18.333 --> 41:23.542
We're just trying to make things work.
It's not all about money.

41:23.833 --> 41:27.042
It'll never happen. Cool it.
You know what?

41:27.333 --> 41:28.375
None of your business.

41:28.667 --> 41:31.917
See you soon. Take it easy, baby.
Yeah, right.

41:36.667 --> 41:38.750
Bunch of bullshit...

41:39.042 --> 41:40.708
Bullshit.

41:56.333 --> 42:02.542
We don't know who's who.
Keys to the entrance...

42:03.500 --> 42:04.792
Hi.

42:05.083 --> 42:09.875
Having a good time, are we?
Drinking coffee...

42:10.167 --> 42:12.292
Do you live here?
No.

42:12.583 --> 42:15.042
No, I don't live in the building.

42:15.333 --> 42:18.667
You're having a meeting?
Yes...

42:18.958 --> 42:22.708
How nice.
Why are you here? Who are you?

42:23.000 --> 42:28.250
I'm the owner of the building.
Oh, right...

42:28.542 --> 42:33.333
So, Chris is your son?
God, no. He's my nephew.

42:33.625 --> 42:37.958
Right. Okay.
Do you deal with him a lot?

42:38.250 --> 42:42.500
I'm afraid we're a bit disappointed
with him at the moment.

42:42.792 --> 42:47.417
He's undermining us pretty actively.

42:47.708 --> 42:50.417
Sorry, what kind of meeting is this?

42:50.708 --> 42:55.792
To tell you the truth,
we're interested in forming a co-op.

42:56.083 --> 42:58.708
Okay...
Possibly interested, we should say.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.500
We're trying to figure
out who wants what.

43:02.792 --> 43:07.208
But hang on.
Then you need to buy the building.

43:07.500 --> 43:08.208
Sure.

43:08.500 --> 43:12.875
But I have no intention of selling it.

43:13.167 --> 43:15.208
<i>No, no... okay.</i>

43:18.667 --> 43:21.167
But" Well...

43:23.417 --> 43:25.958
But... don't let me disturb you.

43:26.250 --> 43:31.667
I won't embarrass you anymore.
No worries. Thanks anyway.

43:32.833 --> 43:34.667
Let's continue.

43:54.542 --> 44:00.333
There's so much at stake.

44:00.625 --> 44:05.667
I'm so impressed myself. I try to come
down here as often as possible.

44:05.958 --> 44:10.083
One, because when the cat's away,
the mice will play.

44:10.375 --> 44:14.333
You need to show your face.
Not that I'm 100 percent involved.

44:14.625 --> 44:19.792
But I still represent the investors.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.042
Stockholm is "the Venice of the North."
I know.

44:41.333 --> 44:45.083
We're just taking that idea
to its logical conclusion.

44:46.417 --> 44:50.417
Surrounded by Swedish rain forest.

44:50.708 --> 44:55.292
All of this is definitely super
interesting and totally fantastic.

44:55.583 --> 44:57.125
Etcetera.
Thanks.

44:57.417 --> 45:02.917
But shouldn't we finish this?
Huh?

45:03.208 --> 45:06.125
What we discussed earlier.
The building.

45:06.958 --> 45:08.375
Your building?
Yes.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.958
That was then. Not now.

45:11.250 --> 45:13.375
What do you mean, then?

45:15.542 --> 45:18.792
You wanted to buy the building, right?

45:19.083 --> 45:22.750
Yes, but business is business.

45:23.042 --> 45:27.125
Is it because of what happened
between us the other night?

45:27.417 --> 45:30.833
No, definitely not.
But you don't want to buy it?

45:31.125 --> 45:34.176
That has nothing to
do with the building.

45:34.188 --> 45:36.083
But maybe with your head.

45:36.375 --> 45:39.375
You don't want to buy it?
My head is here.

45:39.667 --> 45:41.792
I need to focus on this.

45:42.083 --> 45:45.708
I'm just not interested.
I don't know, it's just...

45:46.000 --> 45:49.292
Call it karma... a hunch...

45:49.583 --> 45:52.292
I just don't feel like it anymore.

45:52.583 --> 45:55.583
Seriously, that building is trouble.

45:55.875 --> 45:59.208
Too many illegal sublets.
You can't turn a profit.

45:59.500 --> 46:02.625
Sorry.
Say no more.

46:02.917 --> 46:05.875
There's nothing wrong with the building.

46:06.167 --> 46:10.458
<i>But I just don't...
...want to buy it. That's the problem.</i>

46:10.750 --> 46:13.083
You should've played it straight.

46:13.375 --> 46:14.917
Serum, over.

47:21.625 --> 47:27.958
Words, words, words, words.
What the hell should I do?

47:28.250 --> 47:31.333
Can you do the chorus
and just say "homeless life"?

47:31.625 --> 47:34.042
What was his reason, you feel?

47:34.333 --> 47:39.500
Excuse me, Lex.
Can you turn it down a little?

47:41.583 --> 47:43.958
It's a disaster.
It's an absolute...

47:56.667 --> 47:59.292
Some tenants want to form a co-op.

47:59.583 --> 48:02.333
But it will never happen.

48:02.625 --> 48:06.583
Too many illegal sublets.
They need a majority to bid.

48:06.875 --> 48:10.583
And Chris definitely doesn't want it
turned into a co-op.

48:10.875 --> 48:15.833
And why is that?
He got the whole 7th floor moved in.

48:17.042 --> 48:20.208
Can you evict tenants?

48:20.500 --> 48:24.292
I think you should negotiate
with them and get them <i>to...</i>

48:24.583 --> 48:28.375
Forget about negotiating with them.
Listen to me.

48:28.667 --> 48:34.000
You come here and interrupt me when
I'm working on the music. Homeless.

48:41.833 --> 48:44.167
What happens if I do that?

48:44.458 --> 48:51.417
If they find out you did it,
you'll probably do four to six years.

48:51.708 --> 48:56.667
But, I do think
you'll lose your tenants...

48:56.958 --> 49:00.542
And...
I wouldn't torch it myself.

49:00.833 --> 49:07.000
No, but the police can quickly get to
the bottom of who's done it and why.

49:07.292 --> 49:09.667
Where the orders have come from.

49:09.958 --> 49:14.000
So don't assume you'd get away with it.

49:14.292 --> 49:16.083
You rarely do.

49:19.375 --> 49:23.583
If I... were to lose the tenants...

49:23.875 --> 49:28.833
<i>...will</i> they lose their leases, too?
So they can't come back?

49:29.125 --> 49:33.292
Yes, that's a possibility.
If there's a fire.

50:42.750 --> 50:44.792
Excuse me.

50:45.083 --> 50:48.375
I need to talk to you now.

50:48.667 --> 50:52.042
I need to talk to you now.
It won't take very long.

50:52.333 --> 50:56.250
Hang on. It won't necessarily
take very long.

51:05.750 --> 51:10.625
I mean, of course I know.
Jesus Christ... I know about it.

51:11.917 --> 51:15.417
I know all about it.
I've spoken to them.

51:17.833 --> 51:22.792
You're selling the leases illegally.
Chris is obviously doing that.

51:23.083 --> 51:25.583
Yes! That's exactly what you're doing.

51:25.875 --> 51:31.417
And it can't be turned into a co-op
because of all the illegal sublets.

51:33.625 --> 51:36.250
You're hopeless.

51:43.583 --> 51:46.500
Hey. What are you doing here?

51:46.792 --> 51:50.458
Having a chat with your father.
Yeah. He's great.

51:50.750 --> 51:54.708
Yeah. Want to leave us alone
for a second?

51:55.000 --> 51:59.958
Absolutely not. I've got a piece
of paper I need you to sign.

52:00.250 --> 52:03.167
I've got all the documents right here.

52:03.458 --> 52:07.583
And all your bullshit about
illegal leases and stuff.

52:08.792 --> 52:13.875
The main thing is that
you sign... this piece of paper.

52:14.167 --> 52:17.500
So that we may continue
to manage the building.

52:17.792 --> 52:22.708
You think I'm stupid? You know
I won't sign a thing without Lex.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.500
You'll sign that piece of paper!

52:24.792 --> 52:27.349
To make sure that all
the things we've

52:27.361 --> 52:30.125
fought for collectively
continue to work.

52:30.417 --> 52:37.000
I know what you're doing! You're trying
to shut me out of my own building.

52:37.292 --> 52:39.167
It's nuts!

52:39.458 --> 52:41.917
Right now, I can neither
form a co-op nor sell.

52:42.208 --> 52:47.625
You think I'm stupid?
Forget floor 7. It's about survival.

52:47.917 --> 52:50.917
Then you should've run it properly!

52:51.208 --> 52:55.625
You're fine, on your fucking island.
But we struggle every day.

52:55.917 --> 52:58.167
Struggle? You don't do shit!

52:58.458 --> 53:01.750
When was the last time
you fixed a fucking pipe?

53:02.042 --> 53:04.375
Sign, and we'll go away.

53:04.667 --> 53:08.000
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand!

53:08.917 --> 53:10.250
<i>Don't you get that...</i>

53:10.542 --> 53:12.958
Doing the right thing hurts.

53:13.250 --> 53:16.333
Sign so we can do our fucking jobs!
Get it?!

53:16.625 --> 53:19.583
Sign it!
Don't come so close!

53:21.042 --> 53:22.625
Sign it! Sign it!

53:22.917 --> 53:26.417
Cut it out.
Sign it! Now!

53:26.708 --> 53:29.458
Stop <i>it...</i>
Are you fucking stupid?!

53:33.833 --> 53:36.792
What have you done to our lives?

53:37.083 --> 53:42.917
Do you realize what it means
to do this shit? Do you?

53:43.208 --> 53:47.333
Get a grip! Get a fucking grip!
And you, shut the fuck up!

53:47.625 --> 53:53.083
Don't you get how it fucking feels?

53:53.375 --> 53:57.042
What are you doing?

53:58.042 --> 54:01.000
Fuck off, I'm telling you.
Do you hear me?

54:01.292 --> 54:06.208
You are not thinking,
for one second,

54:06.500 --> 54:10.208
about how much we've helped the family.

54:10.500 --> 54:12.792
Do you get that? I love you.

54:13.708 --> 54:19.000
How can you not understand...
what you've done?

54:26.667 --> 54:32.625
What are you doing?

54:32.917 --> 54:34.208
Take it easy.

54:35.333 --> 54:39.542
Shut up, you fucking cunt!
Fuck you!

54:43.167 --> 54:44.625
Get a grip! Get a grip!

56:29.208 --> 56:31.917
Honey, what are we going to do?

56:32.208 --> 56:35.583
We'll manage.
We've got a bit of everything here.

56:36.875 --> 56:39.333
There... just let me get this off...

56:39.625 --> 56:41.292
Ow, ow, ow!
That's better.

56:41.583 --> 56:44.583
You've got a cut there, too.
Oh, Lord.

56:44.875 --> 56:47.417
Does this hurt? Oh, dear...

56:48.792 --> 56:51.708
Yeah, I don't know about that...

56:53.333 --> 56:54.583
<i>Oh, dear...
Ow!</i>

56:56.875 --> 56:58.417
<i>There...</i>

57:00.750 --> 57:03.458
You just take it nice and easy.

57:03.750 --> 57:06.625
We're out in the country.
Peace and quiet.

57:06.917 --> 57:08.667
On a lovely farm.

57:08.958 --> 57:13.042
Where we'll spend a few days
to help you recover.

57:13.333 --> 57:15.125
How do you feel?
So-so.

57:15.417 --> 57:18.292
Naturally.
Does your head hurt?

57:19.167 --> 57:22.125
You bet your damn ass.
I get that.

57:32.417 --> 57:36.542
There's a lid on top of that.

57:37.833 --> 57:42.583
There you go. That's enough
for what we're doing.

57:48.375 --> 57:51.083
There you go!
Well done! Well done...

57:54.375 --> 57:59.042
Very well done, Nojet.
Thank you so much. I'll connect this.

58:04.167 --> 58:06.667
How do you want it?

58:07.625 --> 58:10.250
Looks good.
I hope so. Hope so.

58:11.708 --> 58:14.875
I'm trying to cheer you up.

58:15.167 --> 58:20.917
But it probably won't happen until
you sink your teeth into this bad boy.

58:21.208 --> 58:23.542
It's huge, I'm telling you.

58:25.833 --> 58:27.042
Beautiful eggs.

58:29.375 --> 58:33.042
This right here, Nojet...
This is good stuff.

58:34.083 --> 58:36.750
Eggs from the farm...

58:37.042 --> 58:39.292
...pork from the farm...

58:39.583 --> 58:43.292
Only thing foreign is the HP sauce.

58:43.583 --> 58:47.000
You want that, right?
We'll get you some of that.

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.958
Italian ravioli.

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:08.042
For tonight's festivities.

01:01:13.083 --> 01:01:18.458
I think it's actually quite nice,
to just heat <i>up...</i>

01:01:21.417 --> 01:01:24.083
Would you like some ravioli?

01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:32.250
Would you like some ravioli, Nojet?

01:01:34.833 --> 01:01:36.750
What are you doing, Nojet?

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:41.042
You're doing your thing.

01:01:41.333 --> 01:01:48.333
But... it wasn't really what
I had in mind for this evening.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:54.250
I thought we'd be able to socialize
a little, in a different way...

01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:57.083
We will, eventually.

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:01.958
Like, when?

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:08.958
You've been on that goddamn machine
around the clock.

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:12.125
Just let me do my thing.
Come again?

01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:16.000
Nothing.

01:02:18.833 --> 01:02:23.542
This dongle is just total garbage.

01:02:29.292 --> 01:02:32.250
There we <i>go...</i>
Let's go!

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:35.958
Hello?

01:02:40.042 --> 01:02:44.458
Wonderful! In a minute...
I'm giving up any fucking second now.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:48.042
But I'll keep insisting.
Are you ready?

01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:52.792
Cheers. But God you're annoying.
Cheers.

01:02:53.083 --> 01:02:57.167
That's because you don't listen.
You've got that machine...

01:02:57.458 --> 01:03:00.292
I have to listen!
...ruling your life.

01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:02.333
And it's scary!

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:28.708
Where will this end?

01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:36.708
Enough.
Cut it out!

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.083
Close that shit. Remove it.

01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:41.708
Wait a second.
Almost done.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.167
This dongle is running
out of data anyway.

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:52.667
Reminds me of a story about how
my last dog was attacked by a wild boar.

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:55.792
I went totally berserk.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:59.958
I had to get the wild boar off
my beloved Labrador.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:06.083
So I attacked the wild boar with
this machete, which I've had for years.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:09.000
And that's a little bit how I feel now.

01:04:09.292 --> 01:04:14.833
I bashed... this goddamn...
wild boar... to death.

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:18.125
And I did everything
I could to save my dog.

01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:22.042
I hit it, stabbed it -
beat the living shit out of it.

01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:26.542
All the way. And that's
a little bit how I feel right now.

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:31.833
I've made an effort
so you'll have a pleasant evening.

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:36.042
But you just keep pushing the buttons
on your damn computer.

01:04:36.333 --> 01:04:39.250
I could cut that thing in half.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:43.167
With this machete.
Do you realize that?

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:49.125
Wait a second. I'm almost done.
I won't wait a second...

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:52.833
I can't wait a second.

01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:58.125
I'm not waiting no goddamn second.
I'm fucking done.

01:05:01.958 --> 01:05:04.667
Goddamn it.

01:05:04.958 --> 01:05:07.333
Fucking bullshit.

01:05:57.542 --> 01:05:59.208
<i>Hello.
Hi.</i>

01:06:00.417 --> 01:06:01.833
How are you?

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:05.750
What do you think?

01:06:06.042 --> 01:06:07.708
Right.

01:06:27.708 --> 01:06:32.167
Ever, never give up, as they say.

01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:35.958
We'll have to keep going
and try to find a solution.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.125
I think you realize...

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:45.167
I could just leave things be.

01:06:45.458 --> 01:06:51.583
But the thought of my wonderful
relatives looking after the building,

01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:55.208
and making big bucks, makes me sick.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500
I get that.

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.333
I need to go home.

01:07:05.208 --> 01:07:09.583
This is a small arsenal.

01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:12.583
Fromanno Dazumal, in many ways.

01:07:12.875 --> 01:07:19.417
You've probably seen this
in many American movies.

01:07:19.708 --> 01:07:24.458
Like this... They sit on their horses
and fire their guns.

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:28.417
This is Sweden's big, famous weapon.

01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:31.500
I like that one.
It's a submachine gun.

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:34.750
Carl Gustaf. Swedish-made.

01:07:35.917 --> 01:07:38.000
Here's a magazine.

01:07:38.292 --> 01:07:41.583
Can I hold it?
Yes.

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:45.792
It's a masterpiece.
Many of them are masterpieces.

01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:52.667
Especially around the trigger.
They tend to be beautiful.

01:07:53.792 --> 01:07:57.125
That's why it's become so popular...

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:03.833
<i>...to</i> squeeze the trigger and mow down
most things in your way, I'm afraid.

01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:07.500
It's terrible, but true.
War is war.

01:08:08.833 --> 01:08:11.167
Super cool.

01:08:22.417 --> 01:08:24.167
You'll make a good soldier.

01:08:24.457 --> 01:08:25.875
You think?
Yeah.

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:28.707
I wonder how long I'd last.
Yeah...

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000
But I won't surrender, they must die!

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.082
Yeah, they'll go down.

01:08:57.875 --> 01:09:02.457
That's wonderful, darling.
You are so fucking strong.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.417
What?
Good, darling.

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:11.292
You look lethal shooting that thing.

01:09:11.582 --> 01:09:14.875
You should've had
one of those through life.

01:09:15.167 --> 01:09:17.917
And blasted it around.

01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:21.707
Now it's your turn.
Let's see what you've got.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.500
Give it to the boss.

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:27.375
That's nothing to worry about.

01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:03.417
How about that?

01:12:03.833 --> 01:12:05.500
Come on! Come on!

01:12:05.792 --> 01:12:07.458
Stop! Stop!

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:10.958
We need to talk!

01:13:28.042 --> 01:13:30.333
What are you doing?

01:13:30.625 --> 01:13:32.042
What are you doing?

01:13:45.042 --> 01:13:47.333
Come on!

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.458
Fucking hell!
We can talk about it!

01:16:13.167 --> 01:16:16.917
Hey. Quick question.

01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:21.708
If I clear the entire 7th floor,
will you buy the building then?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.083
You're saying you will clean out
the 7th floor?

01:16:25.375 --> 01:16:27.292
I'll clean out the 7th floor.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.875
Evacuating an entire floor is not easy.

01:16:30.167 --> 01:16:34.542
Don't you worry about it!
Our guys say it's impossible.

01:16:34.833 --> 01:16:37.417
It's why the deal fell through.

01:16:37.708 --> 01:16:42.167
If I succeed, will you buy it?

01:16:42.458 --> 01:16:44.292
Simple question.
