00:16.717 --> 00:19.419
Come on, Lucy.
Pick up the phone. Pick up.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.454
Pick up. Pick up.
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.156
- Hey, it's Lucy.
- Ah, hello, Lucy.

00:23.157 --> 00:27.761
Er, hello, answering machine.

00:27.762 --> 00:31.731
It's me, Tom.
Remember?

00:31.732 --> 00:33.133
We met a couple of weeks ago.

00:33.134 --> 00:37.337
Think you were chatting
me up at the bar.

00:37.338 --> 00:40.040
Yeah, so I was thinking
there was this festival

00:40.041 --> 00:43.443
this weekend in Ireland
that I'm going to,

00:43.444 --> 00:48.181
and I thought maybe...
okay, I'll call later, actually.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.316
Hey, it's Lucy.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.085
Listen, I didn't...
about this weekend,

00:52.086 --> 00:55.922
I didn't mean just you and I.
It's not like a date or anything.

00:55.923 --> 00:59.492
It's... there's going to be, like,
a whole bunch of us camping.

00:59.493 --> 01:03.229
So, yeah, bring some friends,
if you have any,

01:03.230 --> 01:05.065
just in case we don't get along,

01:05.066 --> 01:08.534
which we would, if you came.

02:47.033 --> 02:49.001
Hello?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.446
Quick. Quick. Let's get out of here.
Here, close the door.

03:03.783 --> 03:05.285
That was a nice pub.

03:05.286 --> 03:08.922
I think I counted 12 men,
seven dogs,

03:08.923 --> 03:11.923
no women, and me.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.331
I thought since the festival
doesn't start tonight,

03:18.332 --> 03:20.500
there's no bands playing,

03:20.501 --> 03:22.634
for a special treat...

03:24.504 --> 03:26.204
I've booked a hotel.

03:30.009 --> 03:33.011
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.783
- You cheeky fuck.
- Ow.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.219
Fore... okay, we've started
already foreplay.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.120
You said we were going up
to the festival tonight.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.189
- That was the plan.
- Yes...

03:43.190 --> 03:45.391
Now I have friends
up there camping,

03:45.392 --> 03:47.225
thinking we're on our way.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.529
It's our two-week anniversary.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.199
Remember?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.902
Oh, you can't have
a two-week anniversary.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.605
It's a nice hotel.
Look in the glove box.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.346
I printed out some stuff
from the website.

04:01.207 --> 04:03.909
Go on, look at it.

04:06.312 --> 04:09.582
"Your slice of paradise
in the Emerald Isle."

04:09.583 --> 04:11.450
Mm-hmm. That's why I booked it.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.291
Forgot to say
you look really nice today.

04:25.164 --> 04:28.067
Okay. Let's go.

04:28.068 --> 04:30.069
You mean it?

04:30.070 --> 04:32.472
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.174
We have to wait here until 7:00,

04:35.175 --> 04:38.177
and then someone's gonna come
and show us the way.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.746
That's what I arranged.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.748
What if I said no?

04:41.749 --> 04:44.050
I thought I was being
vaguely romantic.

04:46.220 --> 04:47.720
Ah.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.589
That's him?

04:49.590 --> 04:51.590
I guess so.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.194
All right, wait.
Whew.

05:10.743 --> 05:13.379
You know, I was chatted up
on the way to the toilet.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.214
Oh, yeah?

05:15.215 --> 05:17.884
Barman thought that I was

05:17.885 --> 05:21.688
a "strong, fine-looking
young thing."

05:21.689 --> 05:22.988
That's a good line.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.395
What? You want me to go back?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.198
You want me to go back
and have words?

05:32.199 --> 05:34.367
I'll have a stern word
in that man's ear.

05:34.368 --> 05:37.603
I'll take him outside, and I'll hit him
right in the middle of the forehead.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.642
Well, whilst you were on the
toilet, some guy bumped into me

05:42.643 --> 05:45.811
and spilt my drink all over me,
on my new jumper.

05:47.046 --> 05:49.882
And then I ended up buying him
and all his friends a drink.

05:49.883 --> 05:53.052
The whole pub?
Why?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.855
Well, he bumped into me,
spilt my drink on me,

05:55.856 --> 05:58.658
so I was like, "Excuse me,"
and he said it wasn't his fault,

05:58.659 --> 06:00.626
and I said,
"Well, it wasn't my fault."

06:00.627 --> 06:02.161
And then it got a bit weird,

06:02.162 --> 06:04.197
and then he did offer
to buy me a drink,

06:04.198 --> 06:06.032
but by that point,
I was like, "Well, look,

06:06.033 --> 06:08.401
I'll buy you
and your friends a drink,"

06:08.402 --> 06:10.703
just to keep things calm.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.704
'Cause I'm a lover.
I'm not a fighter.

07:02.321 --> 07:03.890
What?

07:11.097 --> 07:13.633
Oh, okay.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.635
Yeah, nice to meet you.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.807
Tom, no! He could have seen you.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.675
- Oh.
- Don't be rude like that.

07:48.367 --> 07:50.368
That's really weird.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.117
Do you want some help?

08:05.118 --> 08:06.219
Fine!

08:35.414 --> 08:36.982
Whoo!

08:38.618 --> 08:40.784
Yeah, yeah. Very funny, Lucy.

08:47.727 --> 08:48.861
Ugh.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.263
- Got dirty hands now.
- Ugh.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.898
- Stay away. Ugh.
- Huh?

08:51.899 --> 08:53.599
- Huh? Huh?
- No. Ugh.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.833
Huh? Huh?

09:20.026 --> 09:21.661
Idiots.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.763
They're the guys from the pub?

09:23.764 --> 09:25.197
Think so.

09:27.034 --> 09:29.801
- I need to make a phone call.
- Fine.

09:36.042 --> 09:39.946
I don't know where I am, actually.
Tom booked a hotel,

09:39.947 --> 09:43.349
so I'm not going
to be there tonight.

09:45.052 --> 09:48.653
I've talked with him.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.254
It's a sad field.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.758
How can a field be sad?

10:27.960 --> 10:31.229
I don't know. Just is.

10:32.698 --> 10:35.533
Oh, look. There's an angry tree.

10:36.602 --> 10:39.037
There's some worried mud.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.709
- What?
- I just went over a grumpy stone.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.120
Whoa, whoa. Stop.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.725
Map says to go that way.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.794
- The sign says that way.
- Yeah, but if...

11:01.795 --> 11:03.362
you know, if they're different,
we should check.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.131
Or we just follow the signs.

11:05.132 --> 11:06.998
We could just
throw the map away.

11:08.768 --> 11:12.403
Look, it says Kilairney House
Hotel on the left.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.407
All right, I'm going.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.761
Thought I saw someone.

11:35.762 --> 11:38.029
Oh, yeah?

11:38.931 --> 11:41.199
Was that the end of the story?

11:53.679 --> 11:56.382
You don't have your map out.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.417
Just following the signs now?

11:58.418 --> 12:00.785
- I'm giving you a little bit of time.
- I win.

12:08.594 --> 12:12.465
- Can't see what it says.
- It says "Kilairney House."

12:12.466 --> 12:14.899
They're hidden a little bit.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.448
- This way.
- Yeah.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.583
Oh.

13:08.454 --> 13:10.154
That's...

13:14.026 --> 13:17.061
Um... that's wrong.

13:18.764 --> 13:20.298
What does the map say?

13:21.200 --> 13:24.069
I don't know. Can't see
with this fucking orange blob.

13:24.070 --> 13:27.773
- Well, we followed the signs.
- I'm going to call the hotel.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.011
He's going to say follow the signs.
We may as well just turn round

13:32.012 --> 13:33.845
and phone back when we come back.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.249
Hey...

13:37.250 --> 13:38.884
- ow... fuck.
- Sorry.

13:38.885 --> 13:41.086
I have... sorry.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.789
We've got a reservation
for tonight,

13:43.790 --> 13:46.792
but we've been
following the signs...

13:46.793 --> 13:49.028
We've been following the signs
but we've got lost.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.162
Shh! And we don't know
where to go.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.197
We've been trying to find
the way for a little bit.

13:54.033 --> 13:57.436
Um... well, there's...

13:57.437 --> 14:00.905
they've got two signs, and...

14:01.941 --> 14:05.543
Yeah, no, that's what we've been doing,
but now it's telling us to go back.

14:06.579 --> 14:10.583
Yeah, and I was trying to map
read, but it was saying different

14:10.584 --> 14:13.519
to what the signs were saying.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.153
Hello?

14:20.125 --> 14:22.595
They just hung up.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.998
- Hey, I'm going to go...
- It's not ringing back.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.834
- I'm going back, okay?
- Well, no... he was in mid-conversation.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.803
It hung up. I'm just going
to try to call back.

14:30.804 --> 14:32.337
- Um...
- I'm going to go.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.740
- I'm going.
- Come on.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.042
- No, wait. I have to...
- I'm going.

14:37.043 --> 14:38.843
Shit.

14:50.189 --> 14:52.490
It's not answering.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.560
I don't have any signal.

15:00.165 --> 15:01.367
The Land Rover.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.001
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop him. Stop him.

15:07.339 --> 15:09.974
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

15:14.780 --> 15:17.682
Well, it must be that way.

15:19.018 --> 15:22.388
- What do you mean? Why?
- That's the way he came from.

15:22.389 --> 15:24.223
- So what?
- So it's that way,

15:24.224 --> 15:25.858
'cause he must have come
from the hotel.

15:25.859 --> 15:28.227
Yeah, but no. He left us
before we went into the...

15:28.228 --> 15:29.561
through the gate.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.463
Yeah, well, he's obviously
gone and got someone,

15:31.464 --> 15:34.466
and then he's going back...
he's gone back,

15:34.467 --> 15:37.035
and he's going back
to get someone else.

15:44.209 --> 15:45.711
Ah.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.645
"Kilairney House Hotel"
left.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.926
Well, it says the hotel's
meant to be secluded,

16:00.927 --> 16:04.629
so... must be...

16:14.206 --> 16:17.008
How can we be back
at this bit again?

16:19.511 --> 16:21.347
You must have done something wrong.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.583
We haven't done anything wrong.
Followed the signs.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.218
Well, let's just go
back to the pub,

16:26.219 --> 16:28.053
and they can send someone
to meet us there.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.121
Okay. Let's do that.

17:07.092 --> 17:10.295
This isn't the way we came.
We're going back.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.531
We can't be.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.099
We just can't see it yet
'cause of all the trees.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.935
Tom, we're going in circles.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.070
We can't, Lucy. We're nearly there.

17:19.071 --> 17:20.772
- How are we nearly there?
- We are.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.807
We don't know where we're going.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.929
What are you doing?

17:43.930 --> 17:45.431
I'll go ahead and check,

17:45.432 --> 17:47.532
see if I can see it from outside.

18:48.327 --> 18:50.328
Tom?

18:51.930 --> 18:53.731
Tom?

19:30.536 --> 19:32.837
Tom?

19:51.891 --> 19:54.325
Whoa! It's me. It's me.

19:55.160 --> 19:58.063
What?

19:58.064 --> 20:00.165
- Come on.
- Did you pull my hair?

20:00.166 --> 20:02.300
No.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.940
Hurry up.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.217
Scared?

20:22.120 --> 20:23.554
Aw.

20:26.692 --> 20:30.429
- We're not lost, by the way.
- Oh, really?

20:30.430 --> 20:32.296
But if we were...

20:34.333 --> 20:37.401
it's not either of our faults.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.672
Tom...?

21:04.330 --> 21:06.297
Tom?

21:18.278 --> 21:19.979
Come on, get in. Hurry up.

21:20.712 --> 21:22.947
Hurry up. Come on, come on. Get in.

21:24.516 --> 21:27.585
Fucking hell.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.989
- Keys aren't in the car.
- What do you mean?

21:30.990 --> 21:32.724
They're not in the car.

21:32.725 --> 21:36.728
- They're not in your pocket?
- No, they're not in my pocket.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.096
They have to be around here, then.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.164
They have to be here.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.933
If you say you left them in the
car, then they have to be here.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.269
- Fucking hell.
- Tom! God.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.576
- Fuck, there they are.
- Were they there all the time?

21:51.577 --> 21:53.210
No. I don't know.

22:18.303 --> 22:19.937
Ahem.

22:23.942 --> 22:26.410
I don't know why
I was so scared there.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.948
You were scared there as well.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.082
I see you were.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.688
Huh?

22:36.689 --> 22:39.223
You were quite...

22:40.425 --> 22:42.294
At the time,
I thought someone like,

22:42.295 --> 22:43.862
was gonna to be
sitting at the bush,

22:43.863 --> 22:46.063
waiting for me or something,
jumping out.

22:46.898 --> 22:48.967
I must have taken the keys
out of the car

22:48.968 --> 22:51.002
when I jumped out or something,

22:51.003 --> 22:54.405
or how could they have got there? I
swear they weren't in my pocket.

23:19.631 --> 23:23.267
We're not lost.
We're in a fucking maze.

23:28.306 --> 23:29.940
Was that there before?

23:31.943 --> 23:35.079
- What?
- The sign on the door.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.883
Who cares?

23:41.920 --> 23:44.688
No. Lucy. Lucy.

23:45.524 --> 23:46.824
Lucy.

23:48.293 --> 23:50.261
Lucy.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.912
- What is that?
- It's a map.

24:06.913 --> 24:09.014
Of what? What does it say?

24:09.015 --> 24:11.516
It's in case of a fire.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.218
There's a track through the
forest back to the main road.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.019
Right. Let's go.
Lucy.

24:19.624 --> 24:21.191
Lucy?

24:22.027 --> 24:25.163
Come on. It's nothing.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.400
- Lucy?
- I'm coming. Wait.

24:28.401 --> 24:30.301
I'm coming.

24:41.112 --> 24:42.913
Which way, left?

24:43.782 --> 24:45.183
Lucy, left?

24:45.184 --> 24:46.984
Yes, it'll be on the left.

24:47.886 --> 24:49.354
Just give me the map
for two seconds.

24:49.355 --> 24:51.789
Um...

24:54.793 --> 24:56.461
Yeah. Good.

24:56.462 --> 24:58.563
So if we get reception
on the main road,

24:58.564 --> 25:00.765
we should just phone them
and just say...

25:00.766 --> 25:03.468
just say send someone down
to show us the way.

25:03.469 --> 25:04.970
What are you talking about?

25:04.971 --> 25:07.752
Well, if we can phone them, at least
maybe they can come pick us up.

25:09.941 --> 25:11.475
Huh?

25:16.214 --> 25:18.383
What? What's wrong?

25:18.384 --> 25:21.485
Tom, I do not want to have to go
past that cabin again.

25:28.426 --> 25:30.060
This is it.

25:50.282 --> 25:52.116
Shit.

25:55.520 --> 25:58.489
Oh, fuck.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.732
We can't go this way.

26:45.136 --> 26:47.438
Something's wrong!

26:51.643 --> 26:52.810
Tom, slow down.

26:54.012 --> 26:57.181
Tom, stop. Stop. Tom!

27:01.987 --> 27:03.987
Give me the map.

27:25.210 --> 27:27.312
Just don't know what
the fuck is going on.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.715
I mean, a 50-foot
fucking tree falling?

27:30.716 --> 27:35.420
We're just getting ourselves
in a panic, and it's stupid.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.521
Just don't know
what the fuck's going on.

27:45.897 --> 27:50.134
- My God, we...
- What? It's just branches.

27:54.205 --> 27:56.975
Well, have I got loads of...
have I got room on that side?

27:56.976 --> 27:58.710
I don't know.

27:58.711 --> 27:59.944
- Huh?
- No.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.546
- What?
- Kind of.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.914
Well, do I have room or not?

28:05.016 --> 28:06.651
What? Lucy, look out that side.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.920
- I'm... fuck!
- I'm just asking.

28:08.921 --> 28:12.123
No, it's okay. I don't know.
It's fucking tiny, okay?

28:12.124 --> 28:14.159
Well, all you've got to do
is look out the window.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.260
I'm just asking you to help.

28:27.772 --> 28:30.075
There's another sign.
"Kilairney House Hotel."

28:30.076 --> 28:31.142
What?

28:31.143 --> 28:32.677
- Tom!
- What are you doing?

28:32.678 --> 28:34.112
Tom, there's
someone standing there.

28:34.113 --> 28:35.714
- Where? What?
- Back there.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.782
- There is someone there.
- All right.

28:37.783 --> 28:39.851
- What are you doing?
- Well, if there's someone standing...

28:39.852 --> 28:41.519
- No! No, Tom!
- No, I'll go back.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.688
- Tom, fucking stop!
- Look, if there's a guy there,

28:43.689 --> 28:45.390
I'll ask him if we're
going the right way.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.357
If there's not someone there,
you'll be happy.

28:57.869 --> 29:00.505
Where? Where is he?

29:02.708 --> 29:04.541
It's a scarecrow.

29:07.178 --> 29:09.646
It's just your imagination
playing tricks.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.355
- I really need to go for a piss.
- Now?

29:17.356 --> 29:19.657
I'll be quick. I'm the
fastest pee-er in the world.

29:19.658 --> 29:22.660
You're trying to prove a point.

29:22.661 --> 29:25.062
I'm going to wet myself.
Be two shakes.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.250
- What?
- Tom!

30:19.251 --> 30:20.385
Turn the lights off!

30:20.386 --> 30:21.719
Tom, there's someone
behind you!

30:21.720 --> 30:22.821
What?

30:22.822 --> 30:24.055
There's someone behind you!

30:24.056 --> 30:25.657
Turn the lights off!

30:25.658 --> 30:27.058
Tom!

30:27.059 --> 30:28.793
Turn the fucking lights off!

30:28.794 --> 30:32.329
Tom! Tom!

30:36.334 --> 30:38.570
- What is wrong with you?
- Tom, there was someone there.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.071
Can't I just take a quick piss?
What you doing?

30:40.072 --> 30:41.372
- You didn't see them.
- What?

30:41.373 --> 30:42.941
There's no one there!

30:42.942 --> 30:45.910
Lucy, we've just had that moment
with the scarecrow.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.645
My door slammed, and then there was

30:47.646 --> 30:49.881
someone there when I
turned the lights on again.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.382
Your door slammed?
What, so your door opened up?

30:53.384 --> 30:56.621
No, your door slammed.
My door was closed.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.588
Your door slammed.

30:59.657 --> 31:01.892
Well, I didn't hear anything.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.895
You're scaring me, honestly.

31:06.764 --> 31:08.999
Tom, I'm scared.

31:25.683 --> 31:27.784
He was wearing a white mask.

31:30.054 --> 31:33.657
There was no face.
I couldn't see his face.

31:34.659 --> 31:37.527
Or he had his face painted
or something. I don't know.

31:41.566 --> 31:44.001
Could it have been
one of those men we saw?

31:45.737 --> 31:47.704
Why would you say that?

31:50.909 --> 31:53.143
What happened in the pub?

31:55.213 --> 31:57.381
I've told you.

32:03.154 --> 32:04.688
What the...?

32:06.858 --> 32:09.393
Ah, that's really weird.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.542
They're mine.

32:24.543 --> 32:25.910
- No, they're not.
- Yes, they are.

32:25.911 --> 32:28.812
- It can't be your clothes.
- No, they're my clothes.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.686
Wait, no. Tom, leave it.

32:34.687 --> 32:37.087
Be two shakes.

32:40.725 --> 32:43.427
- That's yours?
- Yes! It's all mine!

33:10.488 --> 33:11.789
This doesn't make sense.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.125
I mean, we've been
with the car the whole time.

33:14.126 --> 33:16.527
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know, Lucy.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.964
What do you mean?
Why are they doing this to us?

33:19.965 --> 33:21.665
Why would I know?!

33:52.597 --> 33:55.500
Whew.

33:59.604 --> 34:01.738
Are you fucking with me?

34:10.815 --> 34:12.815
Why would you say that?

35:14.946 --> 35:17.480
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.

35:23.354 --> 35:25.589
No point in going on.

35:26.424 --> 35:28.592
I don't know where we're going.

35:30.261 --> 35:33.197
There's no signs...

35:33.198 --> 35:35.700
and the petrol's low.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.068
May as well just sit here
until we can see something.

35:48.246 --> 35:50.180
Ahem.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.449
Right. Let's play a game.
You ready?

36:25.450 --> 36:27.718
- What?
- Let's play a game, okay?

36:27.719 --> 36:29.120
You have to answer straightaway.

36:29.121 --> 36:30.821
Whatever I say, you have
to answer straightaway

36:30.822 --> 36:31.923
or else it doesn't count, okay?

36:31.924 --> 36:33.824
Okay.

36:33.825 --> 36:34.926
Pink or blue?

36:34.927 --> 36:35.993
Blue.

36:35.994 --> 36:40.131
A sofa or a... or a seat?

36:40.132 --> 36:42.767
- Sofa.
- Running or walking?

36:42.768 --> 36:43.801
Walking.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.204
- Bare feet, shoes?
- Bare feet.

36:46.205 --> 36:47.305
Naked or clothed?

36:47.306 --> 36:48.806
Naked. Clothed.

36:48.807 --> 36:52.375
Ah, eh... you said, "naked" first.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.512
I changed my mind.

36:57.515 --> 36:59.816
A knife or a fork?

37:00.718 --> 37:02.386
Come on. You have
to answer straightaway.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.620
Okay...

37:04.989 --> 37:07.290
gun or a knife?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.961
I know something happened
in the pub.

37:16.467 --> 37:17.535
Yep.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.936
- Tell me.
- No, that's it.

37:23.541 --> 37:26.677
Tell me. Tell me about the barman.

37:26.678 --> 37:29.146
Maybe you did something to him.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.414
Could be what you didn't do to him.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.985
Could be what you didn't do to him.

37:33.986 --> 37:36.086
- Fuck you.
- Where you going?

37:36.954 --> 37:39.589
I'm cold. I'm getting a coat.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.021
You okay?

38:52.463 --> 38:54.764
No, not really.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.534
You okay?

38:58.803 --> 39:01.237
Yeah. I just don't know
where we're going.

39:06.677 --> 39:08.745
You building a nest?

39:11.115 --> 39:12.449
Yeah.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.634
Stop! Hey!

39:30.635 --> 39:33.369
Stop! Hey! Hey!

39:34.538 --> 39:37.006
Tom!

39:37.875 --> 39:39.276
Oh, God!

39:39.277 --> 39:40.745
- Oh, God!
- Stop!

39:40.746 --> 39:42.446
No!

39:42.447 --> 39:44.581
Get in! Go!

39:47.418 --> 39:50.053
Tom!

40:04.502 --> 40:06.769
What the fuck is going on?

40:14.612 --> 40:16.112
What the fuck?

40:18.416 --> 40:20.817
What the fuck is going on?

40:30.729 --> 40:32.629
- Oh, did I...
- Tom, no.

40:36.901 --> 40:38.536
He hit the car.
He hit the car.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.638
He definitely hit the car.
He hit the side of the car.

40:40.639 --> 40:42.907
- Hit the side of the car.
- Was he wearing a mask?

40:42.908 --> 40:46.911
I can't see anything.
I can't see anyone.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.345
No, I don't think
he was wearing a mask.

40:48.346 --> 40:50.613
I don't think he was.

40:51.882 --> 40:55.052
Lucy, I need to... I need to know
what has happened, 'cause I can't...

40:55.053 --> 40:56.320
What if it's him? What if it's him?

40:56.321 --> 40:58.122
What if we killed...
what if we killed someone?

40:58.123 --> 41:00.057
What if we killed someone?
He wasn't wearing the mask.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.891
What if he's running away?
What if...

41:09.500 --> 41:12.368
I'll go. If you say it, I'll go.
Right now, I'll go.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.940
Tell me. Tell me, and I'll
drive on if you say it.

41:15.941 --> 41:18.274
Tell me. I will drive on.

42:24.875 --> 42:27.177
What?!

42:27.178 --> 42:29.179
Please stop!

42:29.180 --> 42:31.714
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey!

42:36.955 --> 42:38.989
- Did you do this to me?
- No. Wait, wait, wait.

42:38.990 --> 42:41.292
Did you do this to me?

42:41.293 --> 42:42.826
- Did you do this to me?
- No, it's okay.

42:42.827 --> 42:44.161
- What?
- Did you do this to me?

42:44.162 --> 42:46.330
- He didn't do that to you.
- No, we were in the car.

42:46.331 --> 42:48.132
Yeah, we were in the car.
We stopped.

42:48.133 --> 42:49.967
I'm not talking about
when you knocked me over.

42:49.968 --> 42:52.369
Talking about in that woods.
Did you drag me into that clearing,

42:52.370 --> 42:54.004
and did you do this to me
with a knife?

42:54.005 --> 42:56.840
- No. We got attacked too.
- When? When?

42:56.841 --> 42:58.542
Just before.

42:58.543 --> 43:01.378
They're still out there, man.
They're out there now.

43:01.379 --> 43:04.214
- We need to go now.
- Fuck. Tom, get in.

43:04.215 --> 43:06.784
Hold on. Where...
how... where are you from?

43:06.785 --> 43:08.786
- I'm from around here.
- Get in the car.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.387
I got attacked.
We need to get out of here now.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.289
They're going to be looking for us.
We need to go now.

43:12.290 --> 43:15.392
- We need to get out of here now.
- Okay, Tom. Tom. Tom!

43:15.393 --> 43:18.596
- Please just get in the car.
- Do you want this to happen to you?

43:18.597 --> 43:21.097
Do you want it to happen to her?
We need to go now.

43:21.966 --> 43:24.234
- Tom. Tom, get in. Tom!
- I'm serious.

43:24.235 --> 43:25.736
Can we go?
I don't care if you take me

43:25.737 --> 43:28.372
a mile down the road, even less.
Just get me out of here.

43:28.373 --> 43:29.673
Drive.
We can talk about this later.

43:29.674 --> 43:31.642
Please, can we just
get out of here now?

43:31.643 --> 43:33.510
We need to go now.

43:33.511 --> 43:35.145
- Can we go now?
- Tom, please.

43:35.146 --> 43:37.613
Can we go now, please?

44:20.357 --> 44:23.661
Listen... thank you.

44:23.662 --> 44:26.163
I know you hit me and everything,

44:26.164 --> 44:29.766
but if you guys hadn't come
around that corner there...

44:33.637 --> 44:34.705
Ah, Jesus.

44:37.776 --> 44:41.278
- You need a doctor.
- Ah, don't worry about me.

44:41.279 --> 44:43.881
I'm sure the car
took the most of it.

44:47.885 --> 44:49.520
Did you see who attacked you?

44:49.521 --> 44:51.522
I'm not quite sure. I'll be honest.

44:51.523 --> 44:53.924
Could be a group of guys.

44:53.925 --> 44:56.460
They drink at the local pub.

44:56.461 --> 44:58.861
They're not right in the head.
I mean...

45:00.164 --> 45:01.831
I don't understand what's going on.

45:03.600 --> 45:07.003
I'm Max, by the way.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your names.

45:08.772 --> 45:10.273
I'm Lucy.

45:11.108 --> 45:12.575
- I'm Tom.
- Tom.

45:28.659 --> 45:30.227
So are you... I forgot your name.

45:30.228 --> 45:32.730
Linda? Lucy, is it?

45:32.731 --> 45:33.997
Lucy.

45:33.998 --> 45:35.933
Wanna do me a favor and just

45:35.934 --> 45:38.034
tilt the mirror down there
just over here?

45:39.369 --> 45:40.636
Just want to check something.

45:41.872 --> 45:44.407
Just want to check my face.

45:45.642 --> 45:49.246
Oh, Jesus. Is it bad? Is it bad?

45:49.247 --> 45:50.613
No, it's not that bad.

45:52.349 --> 45:54.284
Oh, that's even worse
than I thought it was.

45:54.285 --> 45:56.452
That's a lot of blood.

45:57.287 --> 45:58.655
We better get going.

45:58.656 --> 46:01.125
There's a hotel not far from here.

46:01.126 --> 46:03.827
- Yeah, Kilairney House Hotel.
- Kilairney House Hotel, yeah.

46:03.828 --> 46:05.529
We just went past the sign.

46:05.530 --> 46:08.465
We'll be able to get a
doctor from there or something.

46:08.466 --> 46:09.732
Jesus, I...

46:11.769 --> 46:13.837
I think I need to lie down.
Is that okay?

46:13.838 --> 46:15.372
- What?
- Is it okay if I just lie down a bit?

46:15.373 --> 46:17.241
Yeah. Yeah.

46:17.242 --> 46:18.842
Do you know where we're
going, though, don't you?

46:18.843 --> 46:20.210
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just go straight.

46:20.211 --> 46:21.744
If you follow the signs...

46:47.838 --> 46:49.173
- Max.
- Yeah?

46:49.174 --> 46:52.074
- There's a sign there.
- Yeah, just follow it.

46:55.479 --> 46:58.948
So are you guys a couple, or...?

47:01.218 --> 47:03.219
No.

47:05.055 --> 47:08.125
Yeah, we're going to a festival.
Just stopping off.

47:08.126 --> 47:11.060
- Where's the festival?
- Eh, not too far.

47:14.097 --> 47:16.499
Why are you staying
in the hotel, then?

47:22.039 --> 47:24.407
It's none of my business,
anyway. I'm sorry.

47:29.146 --> 47:31.715
You been drinking, Tom?

47:31.716 --> 47:32.848
No.

47:37.654 --> 47:40.057
No wonder you didn't see me.

47:45.229 --> 47:48.130
I'm not giving you a hard
time, Tom. I'm just...

47:57.140 --> 47:59.176
Uh...

47:59.177 --> 48:01.877
hey, whoa!
Hey, hey, hey!

48:05.749 --> 48:07.150
Fucking sitting ducks here.
Go, go, go!

48:07.151 --> 48:08.619
- Go back? Go back? Go back?
- No, go through.

48:08.620 --> 48:10.654
- Go back?
- Go through it!

48:10.655 --> 48:11.755
Tom, go through it!

48:11.756 --> 48:13.090
- Go through. Don't stop.
- No!

48:13.091 --> 48:14.590
- Tom!
- Don't stop. Go through it.

48:18.562 --> 48:20.197
I know who they are.

48:20.198 --> 48:22.264
Butchers and hunters,
the lot of them.

48:25.637 --> 48:27.638
Fuck's sake, Tom.

48:27.639 --> 48:31.040
Just going to leave 'em there, Tom?
Fucking get rid of 'em.

48:33.076 --> 48:36.346
I'll tell you who they are, and I
know exactly why they're after me.

48:36.347 --> 48:38.782
- Why?
- Ah, bad blood.

48:38.783 --> 48:40.784
Been going on for years.

48:40.785 --> 48:42.251
There's this one guy...

48:43.453 --> 48:47.356
he'll be out there right now.
He's the ringleader.

48:48.191 --> 48:50.026
When he was a kid...

48:50.894 --> 48:53.931
took a notion to hide in the ditch
and wait for a car to come,

48:53.932 --> 48:55.799
and just when it was approaching,

48:55.800 --> 48:59.068
he stepped out in front of it
just to see what would happen.

49:00.337 --> 49:04.474
Now, the driver hardly had time to brake.
I'm sure they tried.

49:04.475 --> 49:07.576
But to avoid hitting the kid,
they swerved off the road...

49:09.546 --> 49:13.315
crashed the car.
Driver was killed instantly.

49:22.526 --> 49:24.727
Have we been here?

49:25.629 --> 49:27.763
- Huh?
- Have we been here?

49:32.636 --> 49:34.972
Why'd you bring us back here, Tom?

49:34.973 --> 49:37.374
This is the last place
in the world I want to be.

49:37.375 --> 49:40.177
You've told me you knew these roads.
Why are you blaming me?

49:40.178 --> 49:41.678
There's no blame here, Tom.

49:41.679 --> 49:43.246
I'm just trying
to figure out what happened.

49:43.247 --> 49:45.615
I've been lying down here in
the back, bleeding to death

49:45.616 --> 49:46.750
after you hit me with the car.

49:46.751 --> 49:48.185
It's not why you're bleeding.

49:48.186 --> 49:51.221
I mean, I'm not all
there right now.

49:51.222 --> 49:53.490
I mean, my head's
been fucking cut open.

49:53.491 --> 49:56.092
I got... you knocked me down.
I mean...

49:57.094 --> 49:59.895
look, you don't
know the way, but I do.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.135
Which way?

50:05.136 --> 50:08.404
Go straight ahead, first right.

50:21.952 --> 50:24.120
Yeah, right. Right, Tom.

50:34.631 --> 50:36.198
Left. Go left.

50:42.939 --> 50:45.508
Just keep going straight, Tom.

50:53.517 --> 50:55.584
Left.

51:17.307 --> 51:19.942
How the fuck did we come...?

51:22.946 --> 51:24.581
They'll still be out there.
I thought they would have

51:24.582 --> 51:26.016
given up by now and gone home.

51:26.017 --> 51:28.285
They've changed the signs around.

51:28.286 --> 51:31.121
Follow any of the signs, you'll come
back to exactly where you started.

51:31.122 --> 51:33.857
You brought us here.
I followed your directions.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.192
You did this.

51:35.193 --> 51:37.059
What did you do to piss them off?

51:38.395 --> 51:39.463
What?

51:39.464 --> 51:41.498
You must have done something.
Something's happened.

51:41.499 --> 51:42.732
Now, what happened?

51:42.733 --> 51:44.034
- We haven't done anything.
- What happened?

51:44.035 --> 51:45.802
We haven't done anything.

51:45.803 --> 51:49.339
- Did you provoke them?
- No, we didn't provoke anyone.

51:49.340 --> 51:51.608
Nah, something's happened.
What's happened?

51:51.609 --> 51:53.809
Nothing fucking happened.

51:55.212 --> 51:57.780
What about the pub?

52:03.787 --> 52:06.189
- What happened in the pub? Did...
- Nothing happened in the pub.

52:06.190 --> 52:07.424
Did you say something to them?

52:07.425 --> 52:09.326
Nothing happened in the pub,
all right? Leave it.

52:09.327 --> 52:13.063
- Well, clearly something did.
- No, nothing happened in the pub.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.135
Lucy, what happened in the pub?

52:18.136 --> 52:19.936
- Someone...
- Did you say something to them?

52:19.937 --> 52:22.472
No, I didn't say anything to them.
Nothing happened in the pub.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.241
So what? Now, clearly
something happened.

52:24.242 --> 52:25.575
Tell him, Tom.

52:25.576 --> 52:29.279
Why are we having... why are we
having this conversation? Huh?

52:29.280 --> 52:31.548
- You said something, didn't you?
- Tom, please.

52:31.549 --> 52:33.349
Lucy, tell me what happened.

52:34.484 --> 52:36.119
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

52:36.120 --> 52:39.156
You provoked 'em, Tom.
Tom, what happened in the pub?

52:39.157 --> 52:40.624
Nothing happened in the pub.

52:40.625 --> 52:42.058
Then, why don't you want Lucy
to say anything?

52:42.059 --> 52:45.529
When it's going to be something
that's really stupid

52:45.530 --> 52:48.798
- that you're going to be saying!
- What? I'm not saying anything...

52:48.799 --> 52:50.267
Tom!

52:50.268 --> 52:51.689
- Tom!
- Tom, where are you going?

53:06.550 --> 53:08.351
Wow.

53:08.352 --> 53:10.653
Really exploring his
maleness there.

53:11.955 --> 53:13.522
Is he always like that?

53:14.591 --> 53:17.359
- We only met two weeks ago.
- Oh.

53:20.430 --> 53:23.366
Well, he did piss off
those men in the pub.

53:23.367 --> 53:26.903
They took offense, which is why
they're doing all this, of course.

53:26.904 --> 53:29.406
You were in the pub?

53:29.407 --> 53:32.408
I didn't say it earlier, 'cause I
didn't want to alarm anybody...

53:33.376 --> 53:35.512
but I saw Tom,

53:35.513 --> 53:37.581
and Tom spilled this man's pint.

53:37.582 --> 53:39.849
No.

53:39.850 --> 53:41.651
No, no, no, no.
It was the other way around.

53:41.652 --> 53:43.787
No.

53:43.788 --> 53:46.022
Tom spilled a pint,

53:46.023 --> 53:47.724
and he was refusing
to buy another one

53:47.725 --> 53:52.261
until the man got real nasty
with your friend back there.

53:53.396 --> 53:55.198
Tom's not like that.

53:55.199 --> 53:57.667
He wouldn't...
he bought everyone a round.

53:57.668 --> 53:59.469
We joked about it.

53:59.470 --> 54:02.237
Yeah, I know it's confusing.

54:07.477 --> 54:10.112
Christ, this pain is getting worse.

54:12.182 --> 54:14.351
You wouldn't have any water
on you, would you?

54:14.352 --> 54:16.652
Yeah, by your feet.

54:18.121 --> 54:20.656
Lucy, could you...?

54:40.243 --> 54:42.245
Thanks.

54:42.246 --> 54:44.246
It's fine.

54:46.349 --> 54:48.784
Couldn't open it for me, could you?

55:18.381 --> 55:20.917
You feel better, Tom?

55:20.918 --> 55:22.785
Do you want me to drive?

55:29.192 --> 55:31.093
No.

55:40.203 --> 55:42.004
I know where we are now.

55:42.939 --> 55:45.073
I can get us out.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.510
So let's go.

56:34.591 --> 56:37.025
My... my head's
starting to bleed again.

56:38.027 --> 56:40.430
Would you have
a handkerchief or something?

56:40.431 --> 56:41.965
I don't want to bleed
all over your seats.

56:41.966 --> 56:43.266
No, I haven't.

56:43.267 --> 56:44.801
Oh, you wouldn't
check the glove box?

56:44.802 --> 56:48.270
It's just that I don't want to
ruin all of your upholstery.

57:02.285 --> 57:04.453
What's that, Lucy?

57:06.523 --> 57:08.858
It's a fire hazard warning.

57:08.859 --> 57:11.161
Where'd you get that?

57:11.162 --> 57:13.062
Tom threw it out the window.

57:13.063 --> 57:15.664
Huh. That's strange.

57:16.499 --> 57:19.334
Did you cut your own face, Max?

57:21.271 --> 57:23.540
You took my clothes,
pulled my hair.

57:23.541 --> 57:25.408
- I did it all.
- You dragged me out of the car.

57:25.409 --> 57:27.043
I cut the tree.

57:27.044 --> 57:29.811
I even wrote on the fucking wall.

57:31.214 --> 57:33.415
It was always just me.

57:36.220 --> 57:37.720
Drive as fast as you fucking can.

57:37.721 --> 57:39.255
I've got a knife in the back
of her fucking head.

57:39.256 --> 57:40.657
Drive as fast as you can, Tom!

57:40.658 --> 57:41.825
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

57:41.826 --> 57:46.162
I'll go straight through
the back of her fucking skull.

57:46.163 --> 57:47.297
Faster, Tom.

57:47.298 --> 57:49.332
Faster, Tommy boy. Faster!

57:49.333 --> 57:52.235
Lucy, go on, tell him.
Can you feel that, Lucy?

57:52.236 --> 57:54.571
- I can feel it.
- There you go.

57:54.572 --> 57:56.706
- Faster, Tom.
- I can't go any faster.

57:56.707 --> 57:58.608
You can go faster.
You're not trying, Tom.

57:58.609 --> 58:00.208
I will kill her. I am not joking.

58:01.344 --> 58:03.812
- Tom!
- Look at the road, Tom.

58:07.016 --> 58:09.352
- I can't go any faster.
- Yes, you can. You can.

58:09.353 --> 58:11.688
I can't go any faster,
or else I'll crash the car.

58:11.689 --> 58:13.456
You make that choice.
Do you want to crash the car,

58:13.457 --> 58:15.391
or do you want Lucy to die?
You can do it.

58:15.392 --> 58:18.261
You can do it. Come on, Tommy.

58:18.262 --> 58:19.796
- Come on, Tom.
- I can't go any faster.

58:19.797 --> 58:21.364
Oh, you can go faster
than that, Tom.

58:21.365 --> 58:22.732
You can go faster than that, Tom.

58:22.733 --> 58:24.434
I can't go any faster!

58:24.435 --> 58:26.536
Faster!

58:26.537 --> 58:28.271
I'll put this knife
right through her skull.

58:28.272 --> 58:30.707
I'm going to put this knife
through her head.

58:30.708 --> 58:32.909
- I can't go any faster!
- Going to put it through her head, Tom.

58:32.910 --> 58:35.545
Faster! Faster!

58:36.714 --> 58:38.480
Faster! Faster!

58:43.853 --> 58:45.955
Whoo!

58:45.956 --> 58:48.424
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

58:48.425 --> 58:51.861
You had a choice back there,
Tommy boy.

58:51.862 --> 58:53.796
I'm not wearing a seat belt.
You both are.

58:53.797 --> 58:57.267
You probably could have killed
me and saved yourselves.

58:57.268 --> 59:00.103
Now you've only
one more choice to make.

59:00.104 --> 59:02.204
I want you to make it, Lucy.

59:03.706 --> 59:06.209
I want you to choose
which one of you I kill.

59:06.210 --> 59:08.077
No!

59:08.078 --> 59:09.145
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

59:09.146 --> 59:10.580
- 10...
- Fuck you!

59:10.581 --> 59:12.982
It's just a name.
Nine...

59:12.983 --> 59:14.083
Fuck you!

59:14.084 --> 59:15.251
- Do it.
- No!

59:15.252 --> 59:16.386
- Do it, Lucy.
- Eight.

59:16.387 --> 59:17.420
- Seven.
- No!

59:17.421 --> 59:19.289
Six.

59:19.290 --> 59:20.390
- Go ahead.
- Five.

59:20.391 --> 59:22.792
Four.

59:22.793 --> 59:24.027
No.

59:24.028 --> 59:25.795
Don't move, Tom. Don't move.

59:29.032 --> 59:31.267
Three.

59:31.268 --> 59:34.604
- How much do you love Tom?
- Do it. Do it.

59:34.605 --> 59:37.106
Two.

59:37.107 --> 59:39.207
How much do you love your life?

59:40.176 --> 59:42.045
You or Tom?

59:42.046 --> 59:43.246
One.

59:43.247 --> 59:45.381
Tom! Tom!

59:56.760 --> 59:58.661
Fuck's sake, lads,
I don't even have a knife.

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:05.935
Wow. Thanks.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:08.270
Thank you.

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.708
What are you doing?

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:14.410
Okay, listen,

01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:16.746
it's been interesting,

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:19.214
and thanks for the ride.

01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:23.586
What are you doing, you fuck?

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:25.054
- See you later.
- Get out!

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:28.157
It's not like I've done anything.

01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:30.693
Get out of the fucking car!

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.369
Safe home.

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.549
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:30.919
- Come on.
- You bastard!

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.022
Come on.

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.758
Come on!

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:40.997
Get the fuck off me!

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:43.032
Come on. Come on.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:44.867
That's it, boy.

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:46.202
- Tommy boy.
- You're fucked up.

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:48.370
That's it. That's it.

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:54.744
All right, Tom.

01:01:54.745 --> 01:01:56.411
Come on, Tom.

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:35.183
Let's finish this.

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:13.556
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:03:13.557 --> 01:03:15.825
- Get off.
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:17.193
Ow, ow, ow.

01:03:17.194 --> 01:03:18.760
Shh, shh, shh.

01:03:33.676 --> 01:03:37.012
Violence is the mother
and the daughter.

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:55.463
Tom?

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.734
Tom?

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.938
Tom?

01:04:11.982 --> 01:04:14.417
Tom.

01:04:14.418 --> 01:04:17.086
Tom!

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:19.354
Tom!

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.541
Ow, ow.

01:05:03.566 --> 01:05:05.734
We're out of petrol.

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:22.385
I wanted...
I wanted to kill him, Lucy.

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.738
I said your name.

01:05:47.176 --> 01:05:49.978
I said, "Tom."

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:07.463
Tom, get out of the car.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.065
Tom! Tom!

01:06:09.066 --> 01:06:11.199
I can't get...

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.972
- What are you...
- Tom.

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:21.609
Go. Move. Move. Run.

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:34.289
Lucy, Lucy, Lucy, wait.

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:47.535
Okay, turn... turn your light off.
Turn your light off. Shh.

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:50.538
- Tom.
- Do it.

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:57.412
Lucy, Lucy...

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:02.884
just keep going. Just keep going.
Go. Come on.

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:06.789
Stop, Tom. Stop.

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:09.057
What's that?
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.468
Go. Go.

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.543
Tom?

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:12.287
Tom?

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:18.393
Tom? Tom?

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.854
Know what you're thinking!

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:48.357
"It looked a lot better
on the website!"

01:13:48.358 --> 01:13:50.726
That took me ages!

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:53.895
You know how hard it was
to find a place like this?

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:01.403
Breakfast is served
half-6:00 to 10:00!

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:04.373
If you need a hand with your bags,
you're going to have to wait!

01:14:04.374 --> 01:14:07.009
As you can see, I am snowed under!

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:10.512
Okay, I'll admit,
rooms are a little drafty!

01:14:12.315 --> 01:14:14.416
See you in the morning, Luce.

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:17.318
Picture-postcard Ireland.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.103
Shit. Shit.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:01.897
Come on, Lucy. Come on. Go faster.

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:04.266
What do you want from me?!

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:10.138
What do you want?!

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:27.989
Come on, Lucy.

01:15:31.427 --> 01:15:34.028
Just finish your fucking game!

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:39.601
You fucking got me!

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:42.837
Whoo-hoo!

01:17:03.051 --> 01:17:05.854
Tom? Tom!

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:08.089
Tom!

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:11.392
Tom!

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:54.822
Come on, Lucy.

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:24.785
