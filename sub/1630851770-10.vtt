09:43.104 --> 09:45.585
WE ARE NOT ATTACHED
AT THE HIP.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.064
AH, COULDA FOOLED ME.

09:47.108 --> 09:49.327
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S IT. I--

09:49.371 --> 09:51.591
WE--WE HAVE TO FIND
SOMETHING FOR HER, REALLY.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.071
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- SHE JUST NEEDS

09:54.115 --> 09:56.508
TO FIND SOMETHING TO DO,
ANYTHING.

09:56.552 --> 09:59.120
SHE'S NOT EVEN ON
THE LABEL ANYMORE, AND
HONESTLY, I AM SWAMPED

09:59.163 --> 10:01.731
ORGANIZING
TOMORROW'S SHOWCASE
AT SLAUSON CAFEÉ.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.647
SHE CAN HELP
WITH THAT IF YOU WANT--
PATIENCE: NO, NO, NO, NO.

10:04.691 --> 10:06.780
I AM PERFORMING
AT THE SHOWCASE, OK?

10:06.823 --> 10:10.784
MAYBE GIVE HER SOMETHING
TO JUST DO ON HER OWN,
SEPARATE FROM MY THING.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.438
I WILL, UH, GET HER
TO MENTOR SOME OF
THE NEWER ARTISTS.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.527
SHE'S GONNA BE
REALLY GOOD AT IT,
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN

10:15.571 --> 10:17.181
GONNA NOTICE SHE'S
THERE, I PROMISE.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.749
- DON'T PLAY WITH ME.
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.751
- HEY.
- HEY.
- HEY.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.361
UH,
YOU REMEMBER CLAY.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.625
YEAH. NEW ORLEANS, RIGHT?

10:25.668 --> 10:27.757
WHAT'S UP?
CLAY: I'M GOOD.

10:27.801 --> 10:29.759
JUST WANTED TO STOP BY
AND GIVE LAYLA HER COFFEE.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.805
ICE, TWO SUGARS, A DAB
OF WHIP MIXED IN,

10:31.848 --> 10:34.111
JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT, RIGHT?
LAYLA: UH, YES. THANK YOU.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.113
- I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT, LOVE.
- OH.

10:36.157 --> 10:37.854
[KISS]
HEY, GOOD SEEING YOU AGAIN.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.508
- YEAH, YOU, TOO,
YEAH, YOU, TOO.
- THANK YOU.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.423
YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:43.033 --> 10:46.689
GIRL, YOU GOT
A BOYFRIEND!

10:46.733 --> 10:49.300
HA HA!
LAYLA: NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, HE'S NOT MY BOYFRIEND,

10:49.344 --> 10:52.042
HE'S...JUST, LIKE, A--
LIKE, A SUMMER THING.

10:52.086 --> 10:55.132
SUMMER'S OVER,
AND I SAW WHAT I SAW.

10:55.176 --> 10:58.309
- OK.
- OK, RIGHT.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.311
SEARCH COMMITTEE
IS WORTHLESS.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.313
THEY RECOMMENDED
HAYDEN FROM VENICE?

11:02.357 --> 11:04.315
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HAYDEN?

11:04.359 --> 11:06.491
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM
SINCE HE SHAVED
HIS MUSTACHE OFF?

11:06.535 --> 11:09.494
HUH! SOMETHING
AIN'T RIGHT WITH
THAT UPPER LIP. PASS.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.496
HEY, GIRL, HEY.
[GIGGLES]

11:11.540 --> 11:13.498
CAN'T YOU JUST ASK HIM
TO GROW IT BACK?

11:13.542 --> 11:15.718
OH, THERE'S
NOT ENOUGH TIME.
CLASS STARTS IN A WEEK.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.329
BESIDES, THAT PROBABLY
VIOLATES SOME RULE
OR SOMETHING.

11:18.373 --> 11:21.985
OK, LOOK, SINCE
WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR
AN INTERIM PRINCIPAL,

11:22.029 --> 11:23.987
HOW 'BOUT WE LOOK
FOR SOMEONE RIGHT HERE?

11:24.031 --> 11:26.337
HOW 'BOUT BILLY BAKER?
DENISE: YOU THINK HE'D SAY YES?

11:26.381 --> 11:27.730
I CAN ASK HIM.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.080
SHOULD WE OFFER HIM
A SCOOTER?

11:30.124 --> 11:32.343
OR NO.
MAYBE WE CAN JUST

11:32.387 --> 11:33.997
PUT THAT IN OUR
BACK POCKET FOR NOW.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.825
LET'S PUT THAT IN
OUR BACK POCKET, YEP.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.348
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, LET'S GO.
DENISE: ALL RIGHT.

11:37.392 --> 11:39.916
- WELL, YOU'RE EARLY.
- NOPE.

11:39.960 --> 11:43.572
TURNS OUT BEING
ON TIME AROUND HERE
IS ACTUALLY LATE.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.748
WHAT, EVEN FOR
A SNACK BREAK?

11:45.792 --> 11:48.403
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE, MAYBE NOT.

11:48.446 --> 11:51.014
I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT ALL
THE RULES HERE.

11:51.058 --> 11:53.364
I'M PROBABLY SUPPOSED
TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE
RIGHT NOW.

11:53.408 --> 11:56.019
YOU SAID YOU WERE
TOO TIRED TO TALK
LAST NIGHT.

11:56.063 --> 11:58.630
YOU WANT TO TALK
TO ME NOW?

11:58.674 --> 12:00.632
- YOU GO FIRST.
- OH...

12:00.676 --> 12:02.852
COME ON, COME ON.
I NEED SOME GOOD NEWS.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.463
UH, UM...I'M SORRY.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.727
I, UH, DON'T HAVE
ANY GOOD NEWS.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.729
UM, DAY ONE
AT THE "TRIBUNE"--

12:09.772 --> 12:12.732
[SIGHS]--WASN'T EXACTLY
WHAT I ENVISIONED.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.777
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

12:14.821 --> 12:17.606
WELL, THIS BAND-AID
WAS FROM A PAPER JAM
IN THE SHREDDER.

12:17.649 --> 12:21.088
THAT WAS ACTUALLY
EASIER THAN THE PAPER
JAM IN THE COPIER.

12:21.131 --> 12:23.743
THEY DON'T GOT NOBODY
TO DO ALL THAT?

12:23.786 --> 12:25.745
THEY DO NOW.

12:25.788 --> 12:29.400
[SIGHS]
OK, SO THEY NOT LETTING
YOU WRITE FOR 'EM.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.403
- MM-MMM.
- BUT YOU WAS WRITING
FOR 'EM ALL SUMMER.

12:32.447 --> 12:35.406
I MEAN, ONE ARTICLE,
YOU KNOW, AND THAT WAS

12:35.450 --> 12:38.061
JUST PART OF
THE SUMMER INTERNSHIP.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.063
JUST--[SIGHS]---

12:40.107 --> 12:42.805
IT'S LIKE I'M STARTING
FROM SCRATCH.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.460
YEAH. I KNOW HOW
THAT FEELS.

12:45.503 --> 12:48.463
OBVIOUSLY, THE HEAD COACH
DOESN'T CARE HOW GOOD
I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

12:48.506 --> 12:50.595
SO I GOT TO PROVE MYSELF
ALL OVER AGAIN.

12:50.639 --> 12:52.815
OH, WHICH YOU WILL,

12:52.859 --> 12:55.513
AND JUST BE LUCKY
THAT YOU'RE NOT
COVERED IN BAND-AIDS.

12:56.993 --> 12:58.952
[HISSES]
OUCH!

12:58.995 --> 13:01.171
YEAH.
SPENCER: YEAH.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.434

MY POSITIONS MEETING,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.004
THEY GONNA SEE
HOW VALUABLE YOU ARE.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.137
- THANKS.

WHAT YOU WATCHING?

13:13.836 --> 13:15.969
- BAKING COMPETITION.
- OOH, WHICH ONE?

13:16.012 --> 13:18.449
THEY'RE ALL THE SAME,
BUT THIS IS THE BEST PART.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.364
HE'S ABOUT TO PUT
THE FINISHING TOUCHES

13:20.408 --> 13:22.279
ON HIS DESSERT.
THIS IS ART.

13:22.323 --> 13:25.805
[CHUCKLES]
OK, UM, I HAVE AN IDEA.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.285
YOU WANT TO BAKE
SOMETHING?

13:28.329 --> 13:30.810
NO. WELL, I MEAN,
NOW, KIND OF, BUT NO.

13:30.853 --> 13:34.378
UM, LOOK, I WAS
WONDERING IF YOU
WOULD HELP ME PRODUCE

13:34.422 --> 13:37.947
THE SHOWCASE CONCERT
AT SLAUSON CAFEÉ
TOMORROW.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.558
NAH. I'M GOOD.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.996
I COULD REALLY USE
YOUR HELP MENTORING
THESE NEWER ARTISTS.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.346
IT'S A REALLY GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM

13:45.389 --> 13:47.739
AND KIM NITTY TO GET
SOME GREAT EXPOSURE.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.959
WELL, WAIT.
AIN'T--AIN'T PATIENCE

13:50.003 --> 13:52.353
SUPPOSED TO PERFORM, TOO?
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T
MENTION HER.

13:52.396 --> 13:55.182
YES, BUT I WANT
YOU TO FOCUS ON
THE NEWER ACTS.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.662
OK, UM,
THINK OF YOURSELF

13:57.706 --> 14:01.231
AS A KEY INGREDIENT
IN ONE OF THESE
BAKING SHOWS, OK?

14:01.275 --> 14:03.843
FINAL PRODUCT'S
GONNA BE BETTER
IF YOU'RE INVOLVED.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.411
[LAYLA CHUCKLES]

14:09.196 --> 14:11.763
[CHUCKLES]
I SAID ON TIME

14:11.807 --> 14:14.375
IS 15 MINUTES EARLY,
NOT 30 MINUTES EARLY.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.377
YEAH, MAN, I'M JUST
TRYING TO DO IT RIGHT.

14:16.420 --> 14:19.902
I MEAN, THIS FIRST YEAR,
ESPECIALLY THESE
FIRST FEW WEEKS,

14:19.946 --> 14:21.904
IT'S GONNA BE A BIG
ADJUSTMENT FOR YOU.

14:21.948 --> 14:25.255
COACH, I GOT TO ADMIT,
MAN, THIS SCHEDULE?

14:25.299 --> 14:27.518
I CAN BARELY KEEP
MY EYES OPEN.

14:27.562 --> 14:30.739
I MEAN, I'M
DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION,

14:30.782 --> 14:33.002
BUT INSTEAD, I GOT COACH
THINKING I'M A SHOW-BOATER.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.352
I MEAN, YOU DID
HIT US WITH YOUR
HIGHLIGHT REEL, MAN.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.354
STOP. STOP, MAN.
[CHUCKLES]

14:37.398 --> 14:39.922
SERIOUSLY, MAN, I DOUBT
HE EVEN REMEMBERS.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.359
COACH, HE SINGLED ME OUT
IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE TEAM.

14:42.403 --> 14:45.275
LOOK, I AM TEAM FIRST.
ALWAYS HAVE BEEN.

14:45.319 --> 14:48.235
AND NOW EVERYBODY ELSE
IS GONNA THINK
THAT I'M, LIKE--

14:48.278 --> 14:51.238
STOP. LOOK,
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER

14:51.281 --> 14:53.805
BECAUSE TOMORROW NIGHT,
YOU WILL GET THE CHANCE

14:53.849 --> 14:55.895
TO SHOW EVERYBODY WHO
YOU REALLY ARE.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.723
- WHAT'S TOMORROW?
- COACH IS GONNA ANNOUNCE
IT AT PRACTICE,

14:58.767 --> 15:02.249
BUT WE GET TO PLAY
A LIVE SCRIMMAGE,
UNDER THE LIGHTS.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.904
YEAH.
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE

15:04.947 --> 15:07.080
TO CLIMB
THAT DEPTH CHART,
AND YOU GOTTA TAKE

15:07.123 --> 15:10.953
FULL ADVANTAGE OF
THESE OPPORTUNITIES,
SPENCE, SO BRING IT

15:10.997 --> 15:13.956
BECAUSE
EVERYBODY ELSE WILL.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.611
YES, SIR.

15:21.137 --> 15:22.747
YOU'RE PROBABLY
ALL WONDERING WHY

15:22.791 --> 15:24.401
I CALLED
A HOUSE MEETING
THIS MORNING.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.403
SINCE OUR LEASE IS UP
IN A FEW DAYS,

15:26.447 --> 15:29.232
I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD HAVE A TOAST
TO THE BEST SUMMER EVER.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.060
WITH THIS STUFF?
IS IT SAFE?

15:31.104 --> 15:34.846
WELL, THE FERMENTATION
PROCESS IS COMPLETE...

15:36.544 --> 15:38.502
ACCORDING TO
THE INSTRUCTIONS.

JORDAN: MMM.
SPENCER: NOPE, NOPE,
NOT DRINKING THAT.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.985
BESIDES, ME AND J.
GOT A SCRIMMAGE
TONIGHT, SO...

15:43.029 --> 15:45.596
JORDAN: WELL, HOLD ON.
I MEAN, IT IS ONLY
ONE SIP, SPENCE.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.598
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
COACH GARRETT DIDN'T

15:47.642 --> 15:49.252
SINGLE YOU OUT
DURING PRACTICE.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.950
JORDAN: NO, I MEAN,
HE'S JUST NOT PLAYING

15:50.993 --> 15:52.473
FAVORITES IN HANDING
PLAYERS THEIR SPOTS,

15:52.516 --> 15:54.083
WHICH--I THINK THAT'S
A GOOD THING.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.955
MEANS THAT EVEN THOUGH
I'M JUST A WALK-ON,

15:55.998 --> 15:57.521
I CAN STILL
EARN A SPOT
ON THE DEPTH CHART.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.133
JJ: GUYS--HEH!--UH,
YOU'RE KINDA RUINING

16:00.176 --> 16:02.700
MY BIG TOAST.
SPENCER: HOLD UP.
J., I'M NOT SAYING MY SPOT

16:02.744 --> 16:05.355
SHOULD BE HANDED TO ME.
JORDAN: NO, YOU'RE JUST
SURPRISED THAT IT WASN'T.

16:05.399 --> 16:08.010

WORKING MY ASS OFF.

ASHER: JJ, DON'T EVEN
GET ME STARTED, DUDE.
JJ: BUT WHAT?

16:17.846 --> 16:20.327
THESE GUYS ARE TRYING
TO MAKE IT TO THE NFL,

16:20.370 --> 16:22.807
ALL RIGHT?
THAT'S NOT MY DREAM.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.462
I WANTED A FULL RIDE
TO COASTAL, AND I GOT IT.

16:25.506 --> 16:28.683

IN HIGH SCHOOL
MATTERS ANYMORE.

EARN IT, THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE.

ONE BAD CALL AWAY
FROM A STATE TITLE.

WITH THE LINEUP, BUT

17:10.246 --> 17:12.553
YOU COULD REALLY HELP
THE SCHOOL OUT.

FOR AN INTERIM
PRINCIPAL.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.949
