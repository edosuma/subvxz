00:02.920 --> 00:05.047
And the Burkes are going to Washington.

00:05.130 --> 00:06.465
I have some news of my own.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.133
I reached out to the National Gallery.

00:08.217 --> 00:10.594
They just called me
and offered me a position.

00:10.677 --> 00:13.472
No more handlers,
no more cases, no more anklet.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.975
I've talked to a lawyer.
A recommendation from you is critical.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.435
NEAL: The <i>Mosconi Codex.</i>

00:18.519 --> 00:21.021
If this book is a puzzle,
maybe these are the pieces.

Take a look at the pages.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.275
This is the idol of Sita.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.152
The idol had eyes
made out of rare diamonds.

00:27.236 --> 00:29.363
The Hope Diamond.
We're looking for its twin.

00:29.446 --> 00:31.865
Mosconi's symbols aren't a message.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.075
They're numbers.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.077
PETER: Her real name is Rachel Turner.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.578
She's the prime suspect

00:36.662 --> 00:39.164
in the murders of
Curtis Hagen and Agent David Siegel.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.124
Neal, she's in love with you.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.169
You are under arrest for murder.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.672
I'm impressed, Neal. That was well played.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.800
-What's the threat?
-I'll see you soon.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.135
-This is Agent Burke.
-Peter, what is it?

MAN 1: <i>Name, Rachel Turner,</i>

01:10.779 --> 01:12.489
Is this some kind of message?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.783
-"Anything you can do, I can do, too"?
-I doubt it.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.996
She walked right out the door in uniform,
same way you did once.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.123
Hey, I didn't have to hurt anyone
to break out of prison.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.792
The CO's in pretty rough shape,
but she'll survive.

01:23.876 --> 01:25.085
When did this happen?

01:25.169 --> 01:29.298
When she was escorted to the yard
for her hour of exercise yesterday.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.341
She used a stethoscope

01:31.425 --> 01:33.510
she cribbed from the infirmary
to strangle her.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.679
Another 30 seconds, she'd have been dead.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.015
Rebecca's former law enforcement.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.225
She's got the skill set
of a trained agent.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.102
With the instincts of a criminal.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.189
This is what we do, Neal, you and me.
Let's track this.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.774
Her first step on the run.
What would it be?

01:48.150 --> 01:50.694
NEAL: <i>On the run, the first thing she'd do</i>
<i>is change her appearance.</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:52.613
<i>Quick haircut, decent dye job.</i>

01:52.988 --> 01:55.365
<i>She'd want to be invisible.</i>

01:58.577 --> 02:02.164
PETER: <i>She'd also need to be mobile.</i>
<i>She'd get a car.</i>

02:02.623 --> 02:07.002
<i>But something that doesn't stick out.</i>
<i>Something nondescript.</i>

02:09.254 --> 02:10.797
She'd also need new credentials.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.341
Who would she go to here in New York?

02:12.424 --> 02:13.675
She doesn't need to go to anyone.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.720
She's a professional,
and every professional has a go bag.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.014
-We already have hers.
-Well, I underestimated her.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.725
<i>Anyone this good</i>

02:21.808 --> 02:25.020

02:25.103 --> 02:26.772
<i>She'll have everything she needs.</i>

02:27.564 --> 02:31.026
But if I'm her, I'm not leaving this city
without the one thing I want.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.110
The diamond.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.738
Yeah, she killed Siegel,
used and murdered Hagen,

02:34.821 --> 02:37.324
manipulated me and everyone in my life
to get to it.

-Which, as we all know, is a joke.

Truly, there's no need.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.356
-You said Rebecca was here.
-NEAL: What happened?

03:09.439 --> 03:12.192
I was asleep, but I heard a noise.

03:12.276 --> 03:15.028
She must have come in
through the balcony. I didn't see her.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.447
I was leaving you a voice message when…

03:18.156 --> 03:20.701
I don't know. She knocked me out.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.161
The least I can do
is make you some tea, hmm?

03:23.245 --> 03:24.580
Something a little stronger.

03:26.915 --> 03:30.002
Wing-tips, would you like some coffee?

03:30.419 --> 03:32.504
Yeah, give us a moment.

-Thank you, June.
-Of course.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.052

03:39.261 --> 03:41.805
It's been sore since I woke up.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.020
-It's a needle mark.
-She injected you with something?

03:48.103 --> 03:50.856
-It could be sodium pentothal.
-Truth serum?

03:50.939 --> 03:52.357
I could be under its influence right now.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.401
Break any laws recently?

03:54.735 --> 03:55.986
Absolutely none.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.362
Definitely not truth serum.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.364
MOZZIE: What if I told her
about my breakthrough?

03:59.489 --> 04:02.242
She could have taken the next step.
She might have the diamond.

on the line. This is a simple trade.

We are on the verge of discovering

-Rebecca's probably bluffing.

Neal said you had

06:02.154 --> 06:03.155
-Yeah.
-Slow down.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.199
We've been looking at them as letters,

06:05.282 --> 06:07.242
when we should be looking at them
as numbers.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.368
Numbers from where?

06:08.452 --> 06:10.579
MOZZIE: An old Hindu numerical system,

06:10.662 --> 06:14.291
probably Mosconi's inspiration,
given the origin of the diamond.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.043
Do we have any idea what they mean?

06:16.126 --> 06:17.920
I'm working on it, but it's tough.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.464
These last two,
I don't know what they are.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.257
They're the only ones
that don't correspond.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.926
They're coordinates.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.553
You have 14 numbers.

06:26.637 --> 06:29.181
Seven and seven in a particular order.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.141
-Latitude and longitude.
-Could be.

06:31.225 --> 06:36.063
And these two symbols you can't decode.
Probably cardinal directions.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.024
I think Mosconi was telling us
where he hid that diamond.

06:45.030 --> 06:46.156

06:46.240 --> 06:50.160
Doubtful the diamond is in
my least favorite parliamentary republic.

06:50.410 --> 06:54.331
They still have a practice there
called marriage by capture.

-Sounds familiar.
-PETER: Keep working.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.292
Trying south by west,

06:57.376 --> 06:59.837
which leads us to somewhere in Chile.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.964
Mosconi never had any kind
of history there.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.049
Try north and west.

07:08.846 --> 07:12.015
It's a stone fort. In Queens.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.893
Stone. Probably made by Masons.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.148
Fort Totten was built in 1862
for the Civil War.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.943
So it existed when
Mosconi was in New York City.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.112
If I have a priceless diamond
that needs safekeeping,

07:25.195 --> 07:28.031
what better place than
a US military installation?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.325
I'll let the FBI know

Hey, uh, that was Peter.

There's a problem with Caffrey's pal.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.674
-It's serious.
-Something's happened to Mozzie?

07:46.592 --> 07:48.051
He was poisoned by Rebecca Lowe.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.722
He's okay for now, but apparently
he only has a few hours left.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.100
You okay?

07:56.018 --> 07:58.478
-Do they know what it is?
-No. Not a clue. It's a mystery.

07:58.562 --> 08:01.398
And I guess they don't have enough time
to wait for the blood test.

for any thefts at a doctor's office,
pharmacy or lab since Rebecca's escape.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.699
She had to get the toxins from somewhere.

in Williamsburg.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.248
-Mugging in Midtown.
-That's interesting.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.375
What? Hanawalt Pharmaceuticals?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.045
Looks like some kind of greenhouse.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.923
Yeah, a lot of prescription meds
start out as poisonous plants.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.091
Robbery happened
after the main lab closed.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.968
Yeah, this could be it.
And, according to this,

08:30.052 --> 08:32.179
NYPD's currently on the scene,
which is where I should be.

-Hey, if you need me, you got me.

This is my… Mozzie.

Agent Burke, right, your offices called,
said you were on the way.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.874
I'm Hopper. Alan Hopper.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.085
Ranger Hopper, actually.
What's all this about?

09:03.168 --> 09:05.838
We believe there's a vital piece
of information inside

09:05.921 --> 09:07.965
that could lead us to
the capture of a known fugitive.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.133
-We're in a bit of a hurry.
-Copy that.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.844

US Army officer and engineer known as
the father of brick fortification.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.022
Foundation's mostly granite.

09:24.106 --> 09:28.402
Well, he had to make some modifications
when the rifled-bored cannon arrived.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.655
Well, I think we can take it from here.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.198
I really appreciate your cooperation.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.575
Anything I can do to help.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.998
You know,
if you could coordinate with my offices

09:41.081 --> 09:43.417
and keep me apprised
of any developments, that'd be great.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.960
I'll get on the horn right now, Chief.

09:47.045 --> 09:51.133
Nice. Let's start looking.
Mosconi must have left some kind of trail.

10:01.059 --> 10:04.855
There are a million different hiding spots
in this place. We need some direction.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.441
PETER: Yeah, I don't see
any distinctive markings or clues.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.693
MOZZIE: Keep looking. We've come too far.

10:09.776 --> 10:13.906
"Death is nothing, but to live defeated
and inglorious is to die daily."

10:15.032 --> 10:16.033

10:16.116 --> 10:18.994

he would stop at nothing

10:19.077 --> 10:21.038
to find the Hope Diamond's twin rock.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.123
Neither will we.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.541
Are you okay?

10:24.708 --> 10:26.293
Yeah, perfectly fine.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.504
It's just a little hot out here.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.131
My pulse is up a little.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.800
It's probably just the heat, though.

10:38.889 --> 10:42.851
We may have to drag him to a hospital,
kicking and screaming if need be.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.520
He says he's feeling fine.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.981
Moz insisted on coming. That's his choice.

10:48.065 --> 10:50.067
But understand,
I look at him as more than a resource.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.152
Resource? You think I'm using him?

10:52.236 --> 10:54.279
Yeah, I think you'll do whatever it takes
to catch Rebecca.

10:54.696 --> 10:55.864
Thirty-three.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.618
-What's 33?
-Thirty-three steps.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.411
The winding staircase, Peter.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.581
Did you just call him Peter?

11:05.249 --> 11:06.250
Who, the Suit?

11:06.875 --> 11:08.377
Okay, maybe he's worse than I thought.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.045
Look, your symptoms are manifesting.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.256
What's manifesting are the answers.

11:12.339 --> 11:17.219
To the Masons, the winding staircase
was considered a theological ladder.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.720
Ladder?

11:18.804 --> 11:20.222
Yeah, representing an ascent

11:20.305 --> 11:23.392
from a lower sphere of consciousness
to a higher one.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.561
We need to climb!

11:26.562 --> 11:29.106
Moz, hold on to the rail.

11:32.484 --> 11:36.029
MOZZIE: Twenty-six, 27, 28, 29, 30…

11:37.489 --> 11:38.782
I don't see anything.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.868
But I'm certain that
Mosconi wanted us to notice.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.369
-Notice what?
-I don't know!

11:42.452 --> 11:44.830
-Okay, okay, stay calm.
-Stay calm?

11:44.913 --> 11:48.166
I'm hours away from palming St. Peter
a twenty to get past the gate.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.835
Calm is not an option.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.470
Freemasons may control the world,
but not my fate.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.598
They have their hand everywhere.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.933
The all-seeing eye of the $1 bill,

12:05.017 --> 12:06.018

12:06.351 --> 12:09.021
MJ's <i>Dangerous</i> album cover.

12:09.104 --> 12:12.691
We're here. The 33rd degree.
The magic number.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.736
The highest level of understanding.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.738
-So why can't I see?
-Moz!

12:21.950 --> 12:23.076
Oh.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.746
Now I see.

12:26.955 --> 12:27.998
Hey.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.876
Moz.

12:39.968 --> 12:43.096
Whatever it is has been in his system
for about four hours now.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.224
EMT: The doctors will run tests
as soon as we get him to the ICU.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.643
-He doesn't have time for tests.
-All right?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.103
Go to the hexagon.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.398
Find my antidote.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.153
I called Elizabeth.

12:58.237 --> 12:59.821
She's gonna be at the hospital with you.

13:00.405 --> 13:03.075
-You're not gonna be alone. Understand?
-EMT: We have to move him.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.284
Now.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.300
When he fell, he saw something.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.428
-Yeah, he said, "Now I see."
-He was looking at the ceiling.

13:27.850 --> 13:29.393
NEAL: This is the hexagon he saw.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.228
PETER: It's made of brick, not granite.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.063
NEAL: Yeah, and it's unlike
the rest of the fort.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.149
Does a hexagon mean anything
to the Masons?

13:36.233 --> 13:37.401
Not that I remember.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.027
They were masters of geometry,

13:39.111 --> 13:41.780
but the shape they were obsessed with
was the triangle.

13:42.114 --> 13:44.032
Six triangles form a hexagon.

13:44.116 --> 13:46.034
NEAL: Yeah, if we look at this
as six triangles,

13:46.118 --> 13:47.536
they all meet at the same point.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.538
Moz said this was all about ascension.

13:49.621 --> 13:52.124
The 33rd degree,
the highest level of enlightenment.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.292
You think we need to go higher?

13:53.375 --> 13:55.252
Yeah, I think we need to get up
on the roof.

13:58.589 --> 14:01.133
JONES: She's playing with us.
She knew we'd track her here.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.051
It could take days to test him
for all of these.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.721
And by then, whatever it is
will be listed as the cause of death.

14:05.804 --> 14:07.681
Beautiful and clever enough
to con Caffrey.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.349
Hell, even I could have fallen
for this psychopath.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.185
Yeah, me too. (CLEARS THROAT)

14:13.061 --> 14:14.980
Right there. I think I saw something.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.816
You see how she moved out
of camera range and stepped back in?

14:18.108 --> 14:20.110
-Let's see what's back there.
-All right.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.907
All right, I'm pretty sure
this is directly above where we were.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.366
It's an old flag pole base.

14:26.617 --> 14:28.285
Any idea what it could mean?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.078
Back when this fort was operational,

14:30.162 --> 14:33.123
they used wind flags
to discern how best to fire a cannon.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.541
How do you know that?

14:34.625 --> 14:37.211
We used wind flags
for firearm training at Quantico.

14:37.294 --> 14:41.965
Essentially, this is a compass
centered around 360 degrees.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.968
Hey, it's all about degrees.
Thirty-three to achieve enlightenment.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.053
What are you getting at?

14:46.136 --> 14:48.597
I think we need to look 33 degrees
from this position.

14:48.972 --> 14:52.142
All right. If true north is 0 degrees,

14:52.684 --> 14:55.729
then 33 degrees points to…

14:55.979 --> 14:59.066
There. That building.
Notice anything about it?

14:59.316 --> 15:01.652
Yeah, it's brick,
and it's another triangle.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.156
PETER: This was a gunpowder room.

15:06.490 --> 15:10.118
Yeah, probably the most guarded
place in the entire fort at the time.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.511
(HOLLOW CLANGING)

15:29.012 --> 15:31.265
What do you have?

15:31.932 --> 15:34.059
This part of the wall isn't brick.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.522
-It's clay.
-Looks like brick, though.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.066
It's pretty hardened.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.735
Some alkaline textures
can thicken over time.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.698
Especially when they're coated in oil.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.032
Oil, as in oil paints?

15:49.992 --> 15:52.160
Mosconi was a great artist.

15:52.244 --> 15:53.704
I think he painted over the clay

15:53.787 --> 15:57.291
so no one would notice this spot
on a first or even a second glance.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.042
This is a faux painting.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.754
There's something behind this wall.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.923
-Still have your lock pick set?
-Always.

pretty enlightened right now.

17:15.118 --> 17:16.995

We give her the diamond,
she gives us the antidote.

18:20.392 --> 18:22.561
What makes you think
she'll keep her promise?

18:22.644 --> 18:24.605
Because she won't do anything to hurt me.

18:24.688 --> 18:25.898
That includes letting Moz die.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.734
As long as we have the diamond,
we have control.

18:28.817 --> 18:31.778
-With criminals, control is everything.
-I know the buyer she'll contact.

18:31.862 --> 18:32.905
I can find her.

18:32.988 --> 18:35.490
You're an expert at being a criminal,
and I'm an expert at catching them.

18:35.574 --> 18:37.326
-Oh, God.
-We can save Mozzie

18:37.409 --> 18:39.828

-But no one enters the park.

No one. You got that?

-It's too easy.
-Tell them I'm on my way.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.185

She has to have another plan.

Give me your gun, Agent Burke. Slowly.

we're dumb enough to follow them here.

That's all you've got? An old trick?

23:57.271 --> 23:59.022
Unless you got a paper clip.

23:59.106 --> 24:01.650
Step aside, Houdini.
I'll get us out of here.

24:03.318 --> 24:06.280
Oh. If I knew you were looking
for a more elegant option.

24:06.446 --> 24:08.448
-It'll work. Now kick.
-(EXCLAIMS)

24:09.032 --> 24:11.743
-On three, all right? A little teamwork.
-Yeah.

24:11.827 --> 24:13.996
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

24:17.374 --> 24:18.834
(HELICOPTER APPROACHING)

24:18.917 --> 24:21.211
-You hear that?
-It's the smartest way off this island.

24:21.295 --> 24:23.422
Yeah, which is usually her way.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.513
-HOPPER: Agent Burke!
-All right.

24:31.805 --> 24:32.931
-You were right.
-Agent Burke!

24:34.391 --> 24:36.101
Agent Burke?

24:37.477 --> 24:39.730
Agent Burke, your wife called.

24:39.980 --> 24:41.440
-Is it Mozzie?
-Yes, sir.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.817
I was to report to you that
he's been given an antidote.

24:43.901 --> 24:45.861
He's responding to treatment.

24:46.028 --> 24:48.030
(LAUGHS) Give me your phone now.

24:48.113 --> 24:50.240
There's no reception down here, sir.
We'll need to go out front.

24:50.741 --> 24:51.742
I'm going after Rebecca.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.744
-Wait for me. I'm calling for backup.
-There's no time.

24:53.827 --> 24:56.038
What can you do to stop her?

24:56.496 --> 24:58.081
Give her a reason to stay.

25:06.381 --> 25:08.008
Rebecca!

25:08.091 --> 25:11.220
Don't come any closer.
I won't graze you this time.

25:13.430 --> 25:15.432
Can that helicopter take both of us?

25:16.058 --> 25:19.102
That diamond could buy us
a nice castle in Croatia.

25:20.103 --> 25:21.605
We could live like royalty.

25:22.564 --> 25:23.899
Sounds perfect.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.277
NEAL: The FBI's not listening.
It's just you and me.

25:28.445 --> 25:31.281
And that helicopter can take us
anywhere we want to go.

25:32.157 --> 25:34.743
How many times do you think
I'm gonna fall for that?

25:35.077 --> 25:38.747
You don't want me.
You've made that very clear.

25:39.540 --> 25:41.166
I think you'll stay anyway.

25:43.085 --> 25:44.878
Why would I stay?

25:45.128 --> 25:47.047
'Cause you won't leave
without the diamond.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.259
What are you talking about?

26:01.103 --> 26:02.145
Check your pocket.

26:03.355 --> 26:04.606
Check it.

26:13.031 --> 26:14.950
Nothing says "I love you"

26:15.033 --> 26:16.368
like a brick.

26:19.204 --> 26:20.956
You.

26:21.039 --> 26:22.374
You son of a bitch.

26:22.457 --> 26:25.502
Hey, just a little sleight of hand.
No big deal.

26:25.586 --> 26:27.880
Maybe your critical thinking got clouded.

26:28.297 --> 26:30.382
I love how good you are.

26:30.465 --> 26:32.050
I hate how good you are.

26:32.134 --> 26:34.428
-Give me the diamond.
-I can't.

26:34.511 --> 26:36.555
Neal, don't make me kill you.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.724
I'll just take it off your beautiful,
dead body.

26:41.018 --> 26:42.519
I don't have it anymore.

26:43.979 --> 26:45.105
Where is it?

26:46.732 --> 26:50.360
Local law enforcement and every FBI agent
in New York are on their way.

26:50.444 --> 26:52.279
Yes, sir. I'll coordinate everything.

27:06.126 --> 27:07.628
REBECCA: You just killed your best friend.

27:07.711 --> 27:09.963
No, Mozzie's recovering as we speak.

27:10.297 --> 27:12.549
Looks like he's out of the woods.

27:13.050 --> 27:14.134
Oh.

27:14.301 --> 27:16.053
And you're in the weeds.

27:16.929 --> 27:20.140
-Where are you going?
-He's gone, and he's not coming back.

27:20.641 --> 27:22.100
He must have heard it over the radio.

27:22.392 --> 27:25.938
Every law enforcement officer in New York
is headed here right now.

27:35.072 --> 27:37.491
Then I'll just trade you for the diamond.

27:37.991 --> 27:39.743
You're going to get me out of here,

27:40.035 --> 27:41.703
one way or another.

27:42.579 --> 27:46.291
Rebecca, you have to know when it's over.

27:48.669 --> 27:52.631
Sometimes, you have to stop running.

28:48.437 --> 28:50.439
(SIRENS APPROACHING)

29:07.915 --> 29:09.625
It's beautiful here.

29:38.570 --> 29:40.822
Well, the leaf of one plant
strikes me down,

29:40.906 --> 29:43.116
the fruit of another restores me.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.535
The circle of life.

29:44.618 --> 29:47.788
Do you really think you should be drinking
this soon after Waterloo, Grouchy?

29:47.871 --> 29:51.500
Uh, doctor's orders. I was instructed
to drink a lot of liquids.

29:52.751 --> 29:57.381
So where is this gem
I almost cashed in all my chips to get?

29:58.423 --> 29:59.508
(GASPS)

29:59.591 --> 30:00.676
Is that real?

30:01.051 --> 30:03.053
They didn't make fakes that good in 1886.

30:03.470 --> 30:04.805
Can I hold it?

30:11.019 --> 30:13.814
You know,
after he had the Hope Diamond cut,

30:13.897 --> 30:16.859
Louis XIV would wear it on his pinkie.

30:18.986 --> 30:21.238
He had grotesquely large fingers.

30:21.947 --> 30:26.201
So is this diamond
our path to easy street?

30:26.285 --> 30:28.078
Yeah, who actually, you know, owns that?

30:28.620 --> 30:32.082
It's my duty as a federal officer
to turn it over to the State Department.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.001
Glad you're feeling better, Moz.

30:34.459 --> 30:36.753
-You ready?
-Yeah.

30:41.008 --> 30:43.969
That diamond is not meant
to be under bulletproof glass

30:44.052 --> 30:47.139
with a bunch of tourists in Bermuda shorts
gawking at it.

30:47.222 --> 30:51.018
Better than being lost
behind a brick wall. See ya.

30:51.977 --> 30:53.687
-See ya.
-MOZZIE: Hey.

30:54.146 --> 30:57.858
Thanks for going all
<i>Terms of Endearment</i> on the doctor for me.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.484
It was fun.

31:04.448 --> 31:06.450
Okay, that diamond is ours, Neal.

31:06.533 --> 31:07.784
We are gonna get it back.

31:07.868 --> 31:09.161
You want to rob the State Department?

31:09.244 --> 31:10.954
Well, it hasn't gone there yet.

31:11.830 --> 31:13.040
It's our meal ticket.

31:13.123 --> 31:17.127
It's supposed to set us up for life,
in a perversely legitimate fashion.

31:17.211 --> 31:20.631
There is no reason
to go after it illegitimately.

31:20.714 --> 31:22.424
Come on, Moz.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.051
It was never about the money.

31:24.134 --> 31:26.345
Of course not, but we could…

31:26.428 --> 31:30.098
You think, if it goes missing,
Peter won't know the first place to look?

31:30.974 --> 31:34.520
My freedom is worth more than
anything that diamond could buy.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.480
Sure it is.

31:36.563 --> 31:40.150
Except your freedom still eludes you.

31:56.124 --> 31:57.835
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

32:52.931 --> 32:56.143
-Am I in trouble?
-Nope. No trouble.

32:57.519 --> 33:01.148
-Did Rebecca escape again?
-She's not going anywhere. Ever.

33:02.024 --> 33:03.275
Then what?

33:03.984 --> 33:06.361
Did I get a new handler?
Who's the lucky agent?

33:06.820 --> 33:08.155
No one.

33:09.281 --> 33:11.700
Well, it certainly isn't you.

33:12.075 --> 33:13.619
You still look like
you're going somewhere.

33:14.161 --> 33:16.496
I made a call to Bruce in Washington.

33:17.039 --> 33:20.542
I filled him in on
your capture of Rebecca Lowe.

33:23.128 --> 33:25.255
I told him you deserve your freedom.

33:27.716 --> 33:29.092
(EXHALES)

33:29.760 --> 33:32.137
-Peter.
-He agreed.

33:33.639 --> 33:36.683
He's meeting with the FBI Director
to put your release in motion.

33:37.601 --> 33:39.228
Once he signs off,

33:39.311 --> 33:42.105
it should only take a call to
the Attorney General to get it done.

33:44.900 --> 33:47.277
-When?
-Shouldn't be more than a couple of days.

33:48.695 --> 33:51.907
-But there is one condition.
-What?

33:52.241 --> 33:54.743
You visit El and me in Washington a lot.

33:55.077 --> 33:58.497
I will be the house guest
that never leaves. (LAUGHS)

33:59.039 --> 34:00.541
And if you don't keep your promise,

34:01.083 --> 34:03.544
if I find out you've pulled
even one caper,

34:03.627 --> 34:06.255
I'm gonna leave my cushy desk job
and hunt you down.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.924
Just like old times.

34:09.341 --> 34:11.051
With the same outcome.

34:25.274 --> 34:27.401
-All right.
-(CHUCKLING) Yeah.

34:27.651 --> 34:30.153
-I'll see you in DC.
-You got it.

34:58.140 --> 35:00.350
Not getting the diamond
changes everything.

35:00.434 --> 35:03.979
Well, finding it helped buy my freedom,
and that is everything.

35:04.062 --> 35:05.063
Except you'll be broke,

35:05.147 --> 35:07.107
without even a government check
to pay your rent.

35:07.191 --> 35:09.610
(SCOFFS) You don't know
how good that sounds.

35:09.693 --> 35:10.694
No worries.

35:10.777 --> 35:15.073
There's a lot of top feeders just
out of range just waiting to be scaled.

35:16.158 --> 35:17.951
I'm done, Moz.

35:18.452 --> 35:20.495
I'm giving up the life.

35:22.122 --> 35:23.123
Oh, come on.

35:23.207 --> 35:26.084
I'm serious. No more jobs.
No more fish metaphors.

35:27.294 --> 35:31.131
Neal, if you're not a criminal,
then what are you?

35:32.508 --> 35:34.593
That's what I want to find out.

35:35.677 --> 35:38.055
You know, it's been five years
since I've seen Paris,

35:39.139 --> 35:40.807
Bangkok, Istanbul.

35:40.891 --> 35:43.018
When my anklet's off, we can go.

35:43.977 --> 35:47.022
Fine, and, while we're there,
if a whale swims by,

35:47.105 --> 35:48.815
we can throw a harpoon.

35:48.899 --> 35:51.902
A whale is not a fish,
so that metaphor is acceptable.

35:53.403 --> 35:57.115
Monet kept painting even when
he was too blind to find his easel.

35:57.199 --> 36:00.285
Mick Jagger will keep touring
until he drops dead on stage.

36:00.369 --> 36:03.163
You have to continue doing
what you're great at.

36:03.247 --> 36:05.499
One of the many differences
between Mick Jagger and I

36:05.582 --> 36:08.544
is that I face prison again
if I keep going.

36:08.627 --> 36:11.004
That diamond was supposed
to be our retirement.

36:11.088 --> 36:12.714
The Suit took that away.

36:12.798 --> 36:14.675
He's helping you get your freedom,

36:14.758 --> 36:18.053
but with a future
lacking in the finer things.

36:19.137 --> 36:23.308
For you,
that's like cutting off your oxygen.

36:30.023 --> 36:32.025
Paris without money.

36:33.026 --> 36:35.112
Is not the city of lights.

37:01.054 --> 37:03.724
Hey, honey, what time is the moving van
coming tomorrow?

37:04.016 --> 37:06.518
-8:00.
-You think we'll be ready?

37:06.852 --> 37:09.897
Well, that's the thing about deadlines.
We have to be.

37:10.105 --> 37:11.690
-I'm gonna tackle upstairs.
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)

37:11.773 --> 37:13.942
No excuses for not joining me.

37:15.277 --> 37:17.070
This is Peter Burke.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.740
Oh, hey, Bruce.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.328
NEAL: Perfect weather for shorts.

37:25.287 --> 37:28.707
When I lose my anklet, I'm gonna go out
and buy a hundred pairs.

37:28.790 --> 37:30.375
Glad you could come by.

37:31.043 --> 37:33.128
-Why the serious face?
-Sit down.

37:34.004 --> 37:36.173
Oh, okay, I get it.

37:36.256 --> 37:38.050
You pretend to look all serious,

37:38.133 --> 37:39.593
then tell me how the FBI Director

37:39.676 --> 37:41.178
and the Attorney General
discussed my case,

37:41.261 --> 37:43.680
and it wasn't as open and shut
as they thought.

37:44.973 --> 37:46.892
It should have been.

37:49.394 --> 37:51.230
You've never been one for the misdirect.

37:52.940 --> 37:54.983
The Attorney General was never called.

37:55.567 --> 37:57.611
The FBI Director reviewed your record.

37:58.737 --> 38:02.282
He told Bruce you blew
any chance of an early release

38:02.574 --> 38:05.244
because of your escape
into Cape Verde last year.

38:05.327 --> 38:07.871
What, and everything I've done since
doesn't matter?

38:07.955 --> 38:10.374
It likely mattered a lot.

38:10.457 --> 38:13.168
We have the highest arrest record
in the bureau.

38:13.252 --> 38:15.337
-Yeah.
-Bruce thinks the real reason

38:15.420 --> 38:18.423
he won't release you
is because you're such a big asset.

38:18.507 --> 38:19.842
The bureau doesn't want to lose you.

38:23.303 --> 38:24.596
I screwed myself.

38:27.057 --> 38:28.642
If you weren't good,

38:28.725 --> 38:31.061
they would have revoked your deal
and sent you back to prison.

38:31.144 --> 38:32.771
So the game was rigged.

38:33.146 --> 38:34.940
No, this isn't a game.

38:36.149 --> 38:37.818
Everything is.

38:40.904 --> 38:42.823
Don't do anything crazy, Neal.

38:43.949 --> 38:45.534
This isn't over.

38:54.793 --> 38:55.836
You okay?

38:58.547 --> 39:01.800
How disappointed would you be
if we didn't move to Washington?

39:04.761 --> 39:05.804
What's wrong?

39:07.097 --> 39:09.683
My request to release Neal was denied.

39:09.892 --> 39:12.352
They want him to serve his sentence
at White Collar.

39:12.436 --> 39:13.520
(SIGHS)

39:13.604 --> 39:16.023
That's not fair. He earned it.

39:16.106 --> 39:17.900
Exactly how I feel.

39:20.485 --> 39:24.031
And now you don't want to go to DC.

39:25.657 --> 39:27.618
It's all bureaucracy, El.

39:28.410 --> 39:30.037
I mean, guys sitting behind desks,

39:30.120 --> 39:32.122
making decisions
about other people's lives

39:32.206 --> 39:35.834
without being a part of those lives
on a daily basis.

39:37.961 --> 39:39.338
It's not me.

39:44.593 --> 39:48.847
Well, hon, if this is what you feel like
you need to do,

39:48.931 --> 39:51.016
then of course I'm okay.

39:55.020 --> 39:58.649
Maybe I'll just…
I'll commute back and forth.

39:59.233 --> 40:01.318
We could talk every night,

40:01.401 --> 40:04.571
and it could be fun
to catch up on weekends.

40:11.119 --> 40:13.956
If that's what you feel you need to do.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.292
Babe, it's the National Gallery.

40:18.335 --> 40:21.171
I mean, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

40:22.714 --> 40:26.426
You wouldn't expect me not to take the job
just because you changed your mind.

40:28.262 --> 40:30.389
I wouldn't. No.

40:34.893 --> 40:37.646
MOZZIE: So the moral of this story,
the Suit can't be trusted.

40:37.729 --> 40:38.856
NEAL: It wasn't Peter.

40:38.939 --> 40:41.400
That you know of,
but, really, what's the difference?

40:41.483 --> 40:43.735
Suits by any other name
are still the enemy.

40:43.819 --> 40:45.487
The question is, what now?

40:45.571 --> 40:48.532
I cracked your old anklet.
I can crack this one.

40:48.615 --> 40:51.535
But the real question remains,
do you want me to?

40:54.079 --> 40:55.581
I want my freedom.

40:56.039 --> 40:57.291
Any way I can get it.

40:59.501 --> 41:02.129
Give me a week,
and we'll be back in business.

41:02.504 --> 41:05.174
-Try to make it sooner.
-Restock your liquor cabinet.

41:30.824 --> 41:32.409
Hey.

41:34.036 --> 41:35.370
Why are you following me?

41:37.331 --> 41:39.041
Who are you?

41:41.418 --> 41:44.004
I'm about to become
the last person on earth

41:44.087 --> 41:45.464
who knows where you are.

41:47.841 --> 41:49.176
(MUFFLED GRUNTING)
