Okay! You can

00:46.460 --> 00:48.460
They are open already.
Your hands are still in way.

00:48.460 --> 00:50.120
-Oh. My bad.
-[gasps]

00:50.120 --> 00:53.830
You have brought me
to cornball game?

00:53.830 --> 00:55.670
And front-row seats?

00:55.670 --> 00:58.460
Not just any
front-row seats.
You, my friend,

00:58.460 --> 01:01.670
are the personal guest
of Queen Eclipsa herself.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.040
Hi!
Have you seen my baby?

01:04.040 --> 01:06.250
Eclipsa,
this is Buff Frog.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.420
Very nice to meet you.
Sweetie!

01:08.420 --> 01:09.830
[giggles]

01:09.830 --> 01:12.460
Sweetie,
come back to Mommy!

01:12.460 --> 01:14.540
So... cornball!

01:14.540 --> 01:17.620
The greatest sport.
Brings together families.

01:17.620 --> 01:20.830
Star Butterfly,
what are you planning?

01:20.830 --> 01:22.750
Nothing.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.460
I'm just really excited to
watch this game with you...

01:25.460 --> 01:28.710
and... maybe convince you
to come back to Mewni.

01:28.710 --> 01:30.670
Why would cornball game
do that?

01:30.670 --> 01:34.080
Because, Buff Frog,
this isn't just any
cornball game.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.960
For the first time,
Mewmans and monsters

01:37.960 --> 01:40.170
will play together.

01:40.170 --> 01:42.080
You mean against each other.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.380
Oh, no, no, no, no.
With each other!

01:45.380 --> 01:47.500
This is the first-ever
integrated match.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.000
Monsters and Mewmans

01:49.000 --> 01:51.500
working together
on the same teams!

01:51.500 --> 01:53.920
That is terrible idea!

01:53.920 --> 01:55.620
Okay, okay. okay,
just hear me out.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.420
I know things were bad
when you left.

01:57.420 --> 02:01.380
Like, really
super, super bad.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.080
But things have changed.
Thanks to Eclipsa,

02:04.080 --> 02:06.580
monsters and Mewmans
are totally equal now.

02:06.580 --> 02:08.830
Just because
things have changed

02:08.830 --> 02:10.620
does not mean
they are better.

02:10.620 --> 02:13.460
Look, I know this is
a lot to take in,

02:13.460 --> 02:16.460
but can you please just
give this game a chance?

02:16.460 --> 02:18.380
For me?

02:18.380 --> 02:19.670
Hmm.

02:19.670 --> 02:22.790
All right, Star Butterfly.
For you.

02:22.790 --> 02:26.620
Anyway, I cannot turn down
a free cornball game.

02:26.620 --> 02:28.120
[exclaims]

02:28.120 --> 02:30.830
But beside all that,
how did you even track me down?

02:30.830 --> 02:32.540
I am master spy

02:32.540 --> 02:34.460
and made sure
we were untraceable.

02:34.460 --> 02:36.210
-I have my ways.
-[croaking]

02:36.210 --> 02:38.620
Whoa! Huh?

02:38.620 --> 02:40.540
Whoa! Ooh!

02:42.580 --> 02:44.460
[slurping]
Hi!

02:44.460 --> 02:47.380
I'm so excited to see
my first cornball game!

02:47.380 --> 02:50.790
Katrina,
did you tell Star
where we were hiding?

02:50.790 --> 02:53.460
What did I say about
being master spy?

02:53.460 --> 02:56.750
You cannot let anyone know
what you are doing.

02:56.750 --> 02:59.080
Just like how
you had no idea

02:59.080 --> 03:02.380
I was still in contact
with Star on a daily basis?

03:02.380 --> 03:05.540
One day, she will surpass me.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.750
I am so proud.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.920
[Kelly over PA]
Welcome to the first-ever

03:09.920 --> 03:12.620
monster and Mewman
cornball game.

03:12.620 --> 03:14.170
It's starting!

03:14.170 --> 03:17.290
We are so glad
you could all join us today

03:17.290 --> 03:19.330
for the greatest game!

03:19.330 --> 03:21.710
Whoo-hoo!
Cornball! Yeah!

03:21.710 --> 03:23.710
Ow! That's so loud!

03:23.710 --> 03:27.290
[chuckles] Sorry, dude.
I am just so hyped!

03:27.290 --> 03:28.670
Hey, nothing wrong with that.

03:28.670 --> 03:30.580
I just wish
I understood the rules.

03:30.580 --> 03:32.710
Mm, don't worry.
I got you covered.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.080
Okay, so that's
Selena Fortune,

03:34.080 --> 03:36.250
Mewni's number-one
cob-kicker.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.670
-Mm-hmm.
-Bleck Drockman,

03:37.670 --> 03:41.330
-the MCL's top stickler!
-Stick, uh, what?

03:41.330 --> 03:43.420
Yeah. The Cassidy Brothers,
they are

03:43.420 --> 03:46.880
-an unstoppable
moat guardian combo.
-Huh?

03:46.880 --> 03:50.540
That's Midfield
husker Danny Doom,
but that's just a nickname.

03:50.540 --> 03:54.040
Wait. And new
up-and-comer Blabby FrontFaws.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.330
Oh, yeah.

03:55.330 --> 03:56.830
But those are just
player names.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.540
I don't know what
they actually do.

03:58.540 --> 04:00.540
Hmm. Oh! I know.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.620
I have an expanded
limited collector edition

04:02.620 --> 04:05.210
of the original rules
and... [grunts] regulations

04:05.210 --> 04:08.380
-It'll clear everything up.
-This is big. [groans, exclaims]

04:08.380 --> 04:09.830
Do you need any help?

04:09.830 --> 04:12.120
Nah, girl.
I'm super good at books.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.960
Uh, you don't have to
stay here either.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.080
You could go sit with Star
if you want.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.210
No, that's okay.
We just got done

04:18.210 --> 04:19.920
with this whole drama
with the Blood Moon Ball.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.500
It's kind of
a long story, but...

04:21.500 --> 04:23.540
If you came here
to see some cornball,

04:23.540 --> 04:26.580
-let me hear you scream!
-[crowd roars]

04:26.580 --> 04:28.330
Oh, sorry, Marco.
[chuckles]

04:28.330 --> 04:30.380
I'm kind of in, like,
professional mode
when I work, yeah.

04:30.380 --> 04:31.710
Uh, were you saying
something?

04:31.710 --> 04:33.920
Nah, it's not important.
You do your thing.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.960
I'll go grab us
some snacks and, uh...

04:35.960 --> 04:38.040
[grunts] skim through
the rule book.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.420
Sounds good, breakup buddy.

04:40.420 --> 04:44.170
What up, sports fans?
It is time to pick teams.

04:44.170 --> 04:46.580
Today's captain
for the purple team
is Bleck Drockman,

04:46.580 --> 04:49.080
and for the red team,
Jason Sheffield.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.170
Aw, yes. This is where
the magic happens.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.880
I'm so excited!

04:53.880 --> 04:56.790
-Let's not get hopes up.
-Shh! Let them concentrate.

04:56.790 --> 05:00.290
And first pick for Bleck is...
Blabby FrontFaws.

05:00.290 --> 05:03.670
Bleck is going for
an aggressive offense
with the up-and-coming rookie.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.000
So, monster
picks monster.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.960
Oh, it's just
the first pick.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.460
I mean, come on.
Look at that guy.
He's built like a tank.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.580
And Jason goes for Selena.

05:12.580 --> 05:15.210
Selena is known for preferring
a low-scoring game.

05:15.210 --> 05:16.920
And Mewman pick Mewman.

05:16.920 --> 05:18.670
Yeah.
[nervous chuckle]

05:18.670 --> 05:21.330
And Bleck's turn.
Back to Jason.

05:21.330 --> 05:23.250
Bleck again.
Now Jason.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.670
Now Bleck.
Back to Jason.

05:25.670 --> 05:27.880
It looks like
old alliances hold strong

05:27.880 --> 05:29.620
on the field today, folks.

05:29.620 --> 05:32.210
Oh, come on!
What are you doing?

05:32.210 --> 05:34.790
You guys notice anything?
This is supposed to be

05:34.790 --> 05:36.880
an integrated
exhibition match,

05:36.880 --> 05:39.710
but you're the super opposite
of that right now.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.670
Come on! Time to
mix it up, guys!

05:41.670 --> 05:45.500
[all muttering]

05:45.500 --> 05:47.880
It is not going to be
working, Star.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.500
I don't get it.
Is this part of the game?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.500
-No.
-Hmm...

05:52.500 --> 05:54.710
This is gonna ruin
everything.

05:54.710 --> 05:56.830
Eclipsa!
What should we do?

05:56.830 --> 05:59.380
-Oh. Well, perhaps we should--
-[snarls]

05:59.380 --> 06:02.210
Popcorn.
Get your popcorn.
[crying out]

06:02.210 --> 06:04.330
Sweetie, what did Mommy say

06:04.330 --> 06:06.670
about preying on those
weaker than you?

06:06.670 --> 06:08.330
I just want to
watch them play.

06:08.330 --> 06:11.250
-Hey, uh, want to see
something cool?
-Yeah.

06:11.250 --> 06:14.460
I just got
a brand-new cornball.
Want to go test it out?

06:14.460 --> 06:15.880
Yeah!

06:15.880 --> 06:18.080
Come on!
This can't be that hard!

06:18.080 --> 06:20.500
You guys have
so much in common!

06:20.500 --> 06:22.330
Like what, even?

06:22.330 --> 06:25.120
Uh, what about...

06:25.120 --> 06:27.120
monsters and Mewmans
both love cornball.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.670
She's right.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.880
[man] But Mewmans
love cornball way more!

06:30.880 --> 06:34.290
In fact, Mewmans
love cornball so much,
we invented it.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.500
Hey, even if
that were true,

06:36.500 --> 06:39.120
which it's not,
monsters perfected cornball!

06:39.120 --> 06:41.170
[man]
Why don't you come here
and say that to my face?

06:41.170 --> 06:42.920
I am not liking
this vibe.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.880
[seethes]
They are ruining
the spirit of cornball!

06:45.880 --> 06:47.710
Hey,
got you a cornshake.

06:47.710 --> 06:50.710
No time for cornshakes, Marco!
I got to go save cornball!

06:50.710 --> 06:52.830
Hey, uh, wait.
Wh-Who's gonna announce?

06:52.830 --> 06:55.120
Oh, yeah.
Uh, cover for me, okay?

06:55.120 --> 06:58.540
If you have any questions,
check the manual.

06:58.540 --> 06:59.580
Right.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.750
Just check the manual.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.420
Chapter one...

07:03.420 --> 07:06.830
The first-ever cornball players
were Mewman. That's a fact.

07:06.830 --> 07:08.420
Oh, yeah?
Where did you read that?

07:08.420 --> 07:10.420
A Mewman history book?

07:12.380 --> 07:14.790
-Hey, you want to come too?
-Come where?

07:14.790 --> 07:17.080
-To... [whispering]
-Wow! Really?

07:17.080 --> 07:19.330
Yeah! Follow me!

07:19.330 --> 07:21.170
Oh, come on.

07:21.170 --> 07:23.620
Guys, guys, cut it out!

07:23.620 --> 07:25.750
Magic bubble
double diffusion!

07:28.120 --> 07:31.000
-What's happening?
-Whatever's going on
is your fault!

07:31.000 --> 07:32.670
[seethes]

07:32.670 --> 07:35.540
-[crowd boos]
-[Star] You guys
need to cool it!

07:35.540 --> 07:39.330
Would it really kill you to
just give each other a chance?

07:39.330 --> 07:41.920
The only thing
I'm giving this guy
is a piece of my mind!

07:41.920 --> 07:44.790
Yeah. Forget cornball.
Let's settle this
the old-fashioned way!

07:44.790 --> 07:46.830
[all chanting]
Fight, fight, fight, fight!

07:46.830 --> 07:49.750
-Guys...
-Do not bother, Star.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.580
It was good for you
to be trying,

07:51.580 --> 07:53.750
but I knew Mewni was

07:53.750 --> 07:56.380
not ready for
this kind of thing.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.960
No, no, no.
I know things
look bad now,

07:58.960 --> 08:00.960
but we can't
give up yet.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.750
Eclipsa,
Show Buff Frog

08:02.750 --> 08:04.880
how much you care about
monster-Mewman unity.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.460
What?
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.420
I'm afraid I'm still
looking for Meteora.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.500
I don't want her
running off on her own
if a brawl breaks out.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.380
Yes. This place is no longer
safe for the children.

08:15.380 --> 08:17.040
It is time for me to leave.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.670
-But, Buff Frog---
-But, nothing.

08:18.670 --> 08:21.000
I refuse to put my family
in danger.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.790
Katrina, Buff children,

08:22.790 --> 08:24.620
-we leave now.
-'Sup, Dad?

08:24.620 --> 08:27.040
Alexi, Anya, where are
your brothers and sisters?

08:27.040 --> 08:29.790
-At the cornball game.
-What? Where?

08:29.790 --> 08:31.380
Not that game.
The other game.

08:31.380 --> 08:33.460
Yeah, the actually fun one.

08:33.460 --> 08:35.290
The other game?

08:37.000 --> 08:37.880
-Wow.
-Whoa!

08:37.880 --> 08:40.830
[laughing, whooping]

08:40.830 --> 08:42.880
Hey, over here!
[chuckles]

08:42.880 --> 08:45.830
They're playing...
cornball.

08:45.830 --> 08:48.000
[Marco] Okay, okay,
so-so if a kicker

08:48.000 --> 08:50.460
kicks with his left leg
and scores, that's three points.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.880
But if it's
raining on a Tuesday,
then that's four points.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.460
-I get it! It's so simple!
-[kids exclaiming]

08:55.460 --> 08:57.830
Huh? What?
Where's that coming from?

08:57.830 --> 09:00.040
[screams]
The game's over here now?

09:00.040 --> 09:03.170
Aw! How did I miss this?
All right, uh...

09:03.170 --> 09:06.120
And they're off! The red team's
hitting the offense hard
with a classic,

09:06.120 --> 09:08.080
uh, creepy crop circle
formation.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.290
And the game's really
starting to heat up, folks.

09:11.290 --> 09:13.500
Team red's going all in
with the beanbag blitz.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.040
Team purple counters
with a hula hoop hustle.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.620
Hey, they made my Jeanie
third kicksmith.

09:18.620 --> 09:21.120
That's cute.
They made my kid
first kicksmith.

09:21.120 --> 09:23.920
-He's got it!
-[crowd cheers]

09:26.380 --> 09:28.920
[gasps]
There you are.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.960
Well, all's well
that ends well.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.500
Jordie,
smile for Mommy.

09:33.500 --> 09:34.880
Go get 'em, Lexxy!

09:34.880 --> 09:36.710
Here come
the huckster hurdles.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.710
They're clearing one,
two, three.

09:38.710 --> 09:40.580
They nailed it!

09:40.580 --> 09:42.880
Got some great
monster-Mewman teamwork here.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.920
Hey, your kids got moves.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.290
We've got some air time--
Nope!

09:47.290 --> 09:49.330
Interception
by the moat guardian!

09:49.330 --> 09:51.040
And he's tossing
to his tenth baseman!

09:51.040 --> 09:53.250
This is for you David.
I'll always love you!

09:53.250 --> 09:55.420
-[whistle blows]
-Wait. What's going on here?

09:55.420 --> 09:57.120
Oh.
That's rule 23:

09:57.120 --> 09:58.920
no shout-outs to exes
on the field.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.880
Oh, yeah. That makes
no sense at all.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.080
-And it's the final play?
-What?

10:03.080 --> 10:05.960
One more cross-field goal
could mean...

10:05.960 --> 10:08.250
Katrina steals the ball!

10:08.250 --> 10:09.960
Looks like team red has it
in the bag, folks.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.250
[Kelly]
Katrina's bookin' it
towards the goal!

10:12.250 --> 10:14.960
She's got a clear shot!
She's going for it!

10:14.960 --> 10:16.170
[all gasp]

10:16.170 --> 10:20.000
It is a corn...
in... the... hole!

10:20.000 --> 10:21.420
What does that mean?

10:21.420 --> 10:24.080
It means they just scored
15 points! They won!

10:24.080 --> 10:26.420
Fifteen points?
What kind of rule is--

10:26.420 --> 10:28.040
You know what?
I give up.

10:28.040 --> 10:31.040
[all cheering]

10:31.040 --> 10:33.000
-Good game.
-It was so much fun.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.040
-That was awesome!
-Great job!

10:35.040 --> 10:37.120
Yeah, we should
do it again.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.330
Hey, your kid played
a pretty amazing game.

10:39.330 --> 10:42.040
And your kid's got quite
the kick... for a monster.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.960
-What did you say?
-Oh, come on.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.750
You people get offended
by anything!

10:45.750 --> 10:48.120
I'm not just gonna stand here
while you belittle...

10:48.120 --> 10:51.750
And...
we're back to this.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.120
Hey, Katrina,
everything okay?

10:54.120 --> 10:56.620
Yeah. I just wish
we could've won.

10:56.620 --> 10:58.920
Guess we will need
rematch.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.170
But cornball
is only played on Mewni.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.120
Then I guess
we will have to stay.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.790
-What?
-What? Thanks, Dad!

11:05.790 --> 11:07.920
Buff Frog,
are you serious?

11:07.920 --> 11:09.750
I still have doubts,

11:09.750 --> 11:12.080
but this game has filled me
with hope.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.000
I'm gonna go tell everyone!

11:14.000 --> 11:16.790
But the adults are still
angry with each other.

11:16.790 --> 11:19.540
[scoffs]
Our generation
is garbage.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.750
-But the little ones...
-[giggles]

11:21.750 --> 11:23.750
they might turn out okay.
