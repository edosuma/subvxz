WEBVTT

00:36.620 --> 00:39.236
( panting )

00:47.047 --> 00:49.254
( neighs )

00:56.390 --> 00:58.381
(men yelling)

01:15.284 --> 01:17.696
( horse snorts)

01:21.373 --> 01:22.783
( neighs )

01:36.763 --> 01:37.969
Come back!

02:00.495 --> 02:02.406
- ( neighs)
- Behind you!

02:15.302 --> 02:16.838
( neighs )

02:50.170 --> 02:51.876
I believe the man's dead.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.043
( laughs)

02:56.218 --> 02:58.174
Agron!

03:01.390 --> 03:03.676
Supplies. Be quick.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.226
Take anything of value.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.052
(wind blowing)

03:20.200 --> 03:22.737
Spartacus, you leave
his cock to the sun?

03:22.911 --> 03:25.243
No.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.075
| send a message...

03:28.250 --> 03:30.206
to an old friend.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.227
Glaber:
Pompey was a fool

03:51.398 --> 03:54.140
to engage Sertorius
absent support.

03:54.317 --> 03:56.979
When has Pompey
ever delayed action

03:57.154 --> 03:59.145
in favor of reason?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.984
Advancing in years,
yet ever the adolescent butcher.

04:02.159 --> 04:04.571
Where youth plummets,

04:04.745 --> 04:06.610
maturity may soar.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.076
Rome will lose all of Hispania

04:10.250 --> 04:12.161
if Pompey's numbers
are not shored against the renegade.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.623
And who would lead such a force
to glorious accolade?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.253
Freshly minted praetor, perhaps?

04:17.424 --> 04:20.211
I serve the Republic, Marcus.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.421
We will take arms
against her enemies

04:22.596 --> 04:25.338
if so commanded.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.883
The embellished robes
of a praetor not yet to wrinkle,

04:30.061 --> 04:33.770
and yet he speaks of war
and laurels.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.398
I speak only
of pressing matters.

04:37.569 --> 04:41.232
We need not tread foreign soil
to find them, do we, Varinius?

04:41.406 --> 04:42.987
Not when Spartacus
and his mongrels

04:43.158 --> 04:44.614
continue to evade capture.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.618
The man is no longer
bound to my concerns.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.574
More of young Seppius's men

04:49.748 --> 04:51.284
were slaughtered
on the road outside Capua.

04:51.458 --> 04:55.326
He sends word to me that one
of the fallen bore your name

04:55.504 --> 04:57.711
carved into his chest.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.249
An unfortunate tether.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.260
Albinius:
Quickly to be severed.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.263
Cossutius awaits my attentions.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.298
Apologies to your daughter,

05:10.477 --> 05:13.514
that I could not linger
to gaze upon her.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.771
Disappointment
to be tempered

05:16.942 --> 05:19.024
with promise
of future visit, hmm?

05:22.405 --> 05:25.397
Come. Let us break meal.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.315
The consuls
will present a motion

05:27.494 --> 05:28.859
dispatching you
to Capua at once.

05:30.622 --> 05:33.159
This is a simple tumultus,
Albinius,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.198
undeserving the attentions
of a praetor.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.369
You brought the Thracian
to Roman soil, Gaius.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.208
You granted patronage

05:40.382 --> 05:42.213
to that grinning shit Batiatus

05:42.384 --> 05:45.376
a breath before his house
fell to massacre,

05:45.554 --> 05:50.014
a massacre my daughter
barely fucking escaped!

05:51.434 --> 05:53.971
Varinius lends his support
to Seppius.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.387
If he's the one to bring
Spartacus to justice,

05:57.566 --> 06:00.683
then that victory will be used
to embarrass you.

06:00.861 --> 06:03.694
Attend to this,

06:03.864 --> 06:07.573
or see yourself rise
no further within the Senate.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.418
( rats squeaking )

06:19.546 --> 06:20.911
(men grunting)

06:23.884 --> 06:25.499
Man:
Don't lower your sword.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.847
(grunting continues)

06:38.523 --> 06:40.809
Eight more Romans
sent to the afterlife!

06:40.984 --> 06:43.600
( cheering )

06:47.532 --> 06:50.319
Peirastes!

06:50.493 --> 06:53.075
Replace wood with steel
for those who are ready.

06:53.246 --> 06:56.488
Vitus, Pyrrhus, Lysandros,

06:56.666 --> 06:58.327
divide these among you
according to skill,

06:58.501 --> 07:00.241
and ready the rest
for demonstration.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.503
lwill kill many Romans.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.288
Of that, l have no doubt.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.879
Return to training.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.588
Spartacus, we need food,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.223
not more weapons.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.975
Steel and coin
are all they carried.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.933
( laughter)

07:21.983 --> 07:23.974
- Whoo!
- ( overlapping chatter)

07:24.152 --> 07:26.609
Oh, good.
My fish supper.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.396
Crixus's men fare better.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.407
Rhaskos.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.987
Where is Crixus?

07:34.162 --> 07:37.279
He seeks Marcellus,
the cunt peddler.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.789
( laughter)

07:39.960 --> 07:42.076
Your men have done well
for themselves.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.460
See everyone to equal portion.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.747
Fuck!

07:46.925 --> 07:49.416
Let the rabbits
fend for themselves.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.676
You have more than enough.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.427
Gained by blood and risk.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.304
What do they do but lay about?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.056
Divide what you have.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.593
I will not ask again.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.530
Fucking Gauls.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.334
Rhaskos is a selfish fool,

08:24.504 --> 08:26.836
unable to see
beyond his own desires.

08:27.007 --> 08:29.419
Spartacus:
No one will go hungry tonight.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.299
That is all that matters.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.676
And tomorrow?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.634
Will bring death
to yet more Romans.

08:41.021 --> 08:44.138
I would see all of them
struck down...

08:46.276 --> 08:49.609
yet not at the cost
of your life.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.238
l have proven
troublesome to kill.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.491
( laughs)

08:59.330 --> 09:01.366
There is no one
that stands your equal.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.156
Hmm.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.836
Yet for those less skilled,

09:08.006 --> 09:10.463
moving towards
the mountains in the east

09:10.633 --> 09:12.294
would be sorely welcome.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.334
Game is plentiful there

09:14.512 --> 09:16.377
and Roman numbers sparse.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.382
It would be wise.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.347
Then why do we stay?

09:23.521 --> 09:24.727
What holds us here,

09:24.898 --> 09:27.184
so near Capua and the threat--

09:27.358 --> 09:29.394
Spartacus.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.110
I hear you wish
to command my men.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.239
No.

09:45.794 --> 09:49.628
Simply to remind them
of what is just.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.585
You would have done the same,
had you been present.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.597
I shall have words with them.

10:08.775 --> 10:12.142
They would be better received
from your lips.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.817
You were in town again.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.116
You risk discovery.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.447
l was not seen,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.487
except by Marcellus,

10:24.666 --> 10:26.076
and he will never speak of it.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.500
Did his blood bear fruit?

10:29.671 --> 10:32.162
A name.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.705
Trebius.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.552
The slaver?

10:36.719 --> 10:38.926
Spartacus:
He will point us towards her?

10:39.097 --> 10:41.679
Marcellus revealed that he
brokered deal of Naevia.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.390
Where do we find him?

10:44.561 --> 10:46.847
He frequents Capua upon
each moon to trade his wares

10:47.021 --> 10:49.148
and to wet his cock
at Arminius's brothel.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.306
News to lift the heart.

10:56.656 --> 11:00.240
It remains firmly bound
until Naevia is back in my arms.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.618
I will have those words now.

11:10.712 --> 11:11.701
Crixus.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.626
Have you had sight of Doctore?

11:17.719 --> 11:19.380
The ludus was his life's blood.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.886
To lay eyes upon those
who have spilled it,

11:22.056 --> 11:25.014
it would salt mortal wound.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.442
- ( cheering )
- ( yells)

11:55.173 --> 11:57.539
( screams )

12:00.803 --> 12:02.418
You fight like a woman!

12:02.597 --> 12:04.007
Fucking kill him!

12:26.829 --> 12:28.740
( booing )

12:35.338 --> 12:37.545
(groaning)

12:37.715 --> 12:39.706
A poor showing,

12:39.884 --> 12:42.717
even for the lesser games
of the Vulcanalia.

12:42.887 --> 12:44.752
Apologies, Magistrate.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.296
These were the best
that could be procured.

12:46.474 --> 12:50.467
The crowd demands spectacle,
Mercato.

12:50.645 --> 12:51.885
Hmm?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.015
They must be distracted,

12:57.193 --> 12:59.809
lest the city fall
to ill temper and panic.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.945
Gladiators and games

13:05.785 --> 13:09.073
Your brother has the matter
well in hand, Seppia.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.787
Words of comfort

13:11.958 --> 13:14.791
to the eight of his men
slaughtered this morning.

13:14.961 --> 13:17.077
Eight?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.913
( crowd cheering )

13:30.143 --> 13:31.474
Yeah!

13:32.603 --> 13:33.592
Apologies.

13:33.771 --> 13:37.355
Pressing business
conspired to delay me.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.140
Is it true, Seppius?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.605
Eight more of your men,
fallen to Spartacus?

13:41.779 --> 13:45.021
- ( giggles)
- A thing of little note.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.030
Spartacus will soon
be brought to terms.

13:47.201 --> 13:51.035
And our beloved
cousin Sextus avenged.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.866
Or you to join him,

13:53.041 --> 13:56.124
leaving me woefully unattended.

13:56.294 --> 13:59.127
What form of brother would I be

13:59.297 --> 14:02.209
to abandon such cherished blood?

14:02.383 --> 14:03.919
(giggles)

14:04.093 --> 14:05.708
Would that Batiatus yet lived

14:05.887 --> 14:09.175
to feel the sting of blame
properly braced.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.715
Spartacus and his shits will be
put to grass soon enough.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.349
l have already
sent dispatch to Rome

14:13.519 --> 14:14.725
for aid in the matter.

14:16.064 --> 14:19.352
Perhaps you can secure
better entertainment as well.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.517
The current offerings bore
beyond the telling.

14:27.909 --> 14:30.696
( cheering )

14:34.207 --> 14:36.038
(gasping )

14:36.209 --> 14:37.415
( groans )

14:48.638 --> 14:50.754
(jeering, booing )

14:59.816 --> 15:01.807
Crowd: No! No! No!

15:01.984 --> 15:03.315
No!No!No!No!

15:03.486 --> 15:04.851
No!No!No!No!

15:05.029 --> 15:07.020
A poor showing.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.732
( cheering )

15:36.310 --> 15:37.811
l have nothing of worth.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.810
We seek only words.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.978
I am absent them as well.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.768
You were Batiatus's man,
were you not?

15:46.946 --> 15:48.152
You are mistaken.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.778
No, I saw him

15:49.949 --> 15:52.065
when he yet commanded
the sands of the arena.

15:52.243 --> 15:55.531
l was there in Pompeii
the day he faced Theokoles

15:55.705 --> 15:58.242
and barely lived to speak of it.

15:58.416 --> 16:01.123
Oenomaus, he was called.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.876
It is fortunate you are not him.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.332
The man stands accused
of turning upon his dominus,

16:06.507 --> 16:10.876
the reward for his capture
a substantial sum,

16:11.053 --> 16:13.180
toward Spartacus yet higher.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.849
If he were to be revealed,

16:18.019 --> 16:20.510
a man such as you could...

16:20.688 --> 16:22.224
continue not being himself.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.731
As I said,

16:25.902 --> 16:28.439
l have nothing of worth.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.063
A lesser sum, then.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.868
( screams )

16:47.256 --> 16:48.291
Apologies.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.883
You are not Batiatus' man.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.464
(gurgles)

17:03.773 --> 17:05.764
( dog barks )

17:08.110 --> 17:10.442
Spartacus:
You should not be outside.

17:10.613 --> 17:11.978
I wanted to see the moon.

17:12.156 --> 17:15.273
Janus loves to gaze upon it.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.819
Varro would hoist him
upon his shoulders,

17:19.997 --> 17:21.373
and he would stretch
his hands out,

17:21.541 --> 17:23.623
attempting to wrest it
from the heavens.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.749
Perhaps one day he shall.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.253
Butnotupon
his father's shoulders.

17:31.133 --> 17:34.261
Janus is yet too young
for memory to take proper hold.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.387
I doubt he would recall
the sight of me now.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.265
You are his mother.

17:41.435 --> 17:45.098
Years would not lessen
such a bond.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.934
He will burst
as sun through clouds

17:47.108 --> 17:48.473
at the sight of you.

17:50.945 --> 17:54.358
l have dreamt of nothing else
since our parting.

17:54.532 --> 17:58.116
A lopsided grin,
eyes promising mischief.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.319
I've seen it many times...

18:03.457 --> 18:05.118
on his father.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.167
It was what drew me to him.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.336
I fell to love the crooked bend
of Varro's lips

18:14.510 --> 18:16.216
long before the man himself.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.721
As did I.

18:26.147 --> 18:28.638
Mira speaks of the mountains
to the east.

18:28.816 --> 18:31.102
l have thoughts
towards dispatching men

18:31.277 --> 18:33.142
to hunt for game.

18:34.572 --> 18:37.655
Your brother tends to Janus
not far from there, does he not?

18:37.825 --> 18:39.406
The moon within closer reach.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.238
I would shorten the distance.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.744
You think l have not longed
to have it so?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.250
To be far from all of this?

18:52.089 --> 18:55.627
I am branded fugitivus
with the rest of you.

18:55.801 --> 18:59.635
What life could I offer my son
beneath such shadow?

19:00.848 --> 19:02.054
None...

19:02.224 --> 19:05.591
within the Republic.

19:07.271 --> 19:11.560
All the coin l have relieved
of the Romans since our escape--

19:11.734 --> 19:14.942
enough to buy you
and your son passage

19:15.112 --> 19:16.101
far from these shores.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.895
Spartacus--

19:18.074 --> 19:20.986
Varro's last words
were of you and Janus,

19:21.160 --> 19:23.822
that | see you cared for.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.831
It need not have been spoken.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.509
Send word to Crescentia

19:44.684 --> 19:47.346
that I must move our midday meal
to later in the week.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.594
And respond to Varis' request

19:50.773 --> 19:52.263
for our presence
at his celebration.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.306
We will not be attending.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.356
(giggles)

19:58.531 --> 20:00.317
I know you
do not care for the man,

20:00.491 --> 20:02.732
yet he is well connected.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.650
We must make appearance.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.410
Your father
would have it otherwise.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.071
He dispatches me to Capua

20:09.250 --> 20:10.865
to deal with Spartacus.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.124
- I will have word with him.
- He is set upon it.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.131
You are a praetor, Gaius.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.634
Hunting errant slaves
is beneath you.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.975
Yet it must be done.

20:30.980 --> 20:34.097
But I promise
we will return to Rome

20:34.275 --> 20:37.767
well before our child
enters this world.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.936
We?

20:40.114 --> 20:41.445
You will accompany me,
of course.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.196
lwill not.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.948
Out.

20:52.626 --> 20:56.164
I am bound to the house
of Batiatus by patronage,

20:56.338 --> 20:59.171
granted only
to bury knowledge

20:59.341 --> 21:00.547
of the blood
staining your hands.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.299
What happened to Licinia
was an accident.

21:02.470 --> 21:04.756
She was the cousin
of Marcus Crassus!

21:04.930 --> 21:06.795
She was a fucking bitch!

21:16.901 --> 21:19.734
All who knew of the deed

21:21.489 --> 21:23.025
speak no more.

21:26.327 --> 21:28.739
Let us put it behind us.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.614
I intend to.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.040
Now make preparations.

21:36.212 --> 21:38.077
We leave for Capua

21:38.255 --> 21:40.507
to put an end
to the curse of Spartacus.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.629
You believe
the words of Marcellus,

21:47.807 --> 21:50.219
bleated from tongue
with sword to neck?

21:50.392 --> 21:52.303
Crixus moves on Arminius
and his place of whores,

21:52.478 --> 21:53.934
and I will be at his side.

21:54.104 --> 21:56.595
So we follow
the fucking Gaul now?

21:56.774 --> 21:58.389
I swore aid in the matter.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.148
You did not.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.402
I would not think less
if you stayed from it.

22:05.449 --> 22:06.825
I am with you.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.530
You had me at whores.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.954
Avoid unnecessary risk

22:14.124 --> 22:17.582
and provoking words
towards the Gauls.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.332
( man laughs)

22:21.507 --> 22:23.623
( man coughs)

22:23.801 --> 22:25.382
Was he swayed?

22:25.553 --> 22:27.760
Have you met the man?

22:27.930 --> 22:30.672
Taking such a large force
to the city is foolish.

22:30.850 --> 22:34.843
As are all things
in the pursuit of a woman.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.809
Peirastes leads
the hunt for game.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.274
He will see you safely
to your son's arms,

22:43.445 --> 22:46.312
from where you have been
too long absent.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.404
See your boy to a man,

22:51.579 --> 22:54.571
that I may one day greet him
as a brother.

22:54.748 --> 22:57.876
lwill tell Janus of you,

22:58.043 --> 23:02.036
of the man who loved his father
above all others.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.269
She takes to foot?

23:23.444 --> 23:25.435
Long overdue.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.440
As are many things this night.

23:30.618 --> 23:32.404
This is not your fight,
Spartacus.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.364
I gave my word.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.449
Blood and honor,

23:36.624 --> 23:38.330
it yet speaks to the man.

23:39.543 --> 23:43.536
Then let us split darkness
with the cries of Romans.

23:44.882 --> 23:47.373
(music playing )

23:47.551 --> 23:50.167
(women laughing,
squealing )

23:53.474 --> 23:55.089
( man shrieks )

24:16.121 --> 24:17.702
(woman laughs)

24:17.873 --> 24:19.579
(man yelling)

24:26.674 --> 24:28.756
( laughter)

25:09.425 --> 25:10.414
( screams )

25:10.592 --> 25:12.753
( all screaming )

25:27.192 --> 25:28.898
Go!

25:30.863 --> 25:32.774
Trebius!

25:36.827 --> 25:38.158
( screams )

25:53.886 --> 25:55.717
(gasping )

26:10.861 --> 26:13.398
Where is Trebius?

26:16.700 --> 26:18.201
Where?

26:21.080 --> 26:23.446
(women sobbing )

26:23.624 --> 26:25.330
- Get off the fucking floor!
- No!

26:25.501 --> 26:27.537
Get off the fucking floor,
bitch!

26:27.711 --> 26:29.326
( screams )

26:29.505 --> 26:30.745
(spits)

26:30.923 --> 26:32.914
- ( chuckles )
- ( screaming )

26:33.926 --> 26:35.587
Trebius.

26:38.055 --> 26:40.296
I would have words.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.007
I would not.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.550
Raah!

26:44.728 --> 26:45.934
(metal ringing)

26:46.105 --> 26:47.470
Hah!

26:54.738 --> 26:55.818
No!

26:59.827 --> 27:01.442
- Your man?
- More guards!

27:01.620 --> 27:03.030
We need--

27:03.205 --> 27:05.617
Trebius. You fucking cunt!

27:05.791 --> 27:06.780
Agron!

27:06.959 --> 27:10.668
This is the Roman shit
that sold me and Duro to Batiatus.

27:10.838 --> 27:12.624
My brother would be alive
if it were not for him.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.334
He knows the whereabouts
of Naevia.

27:14.508 --> 27:15.668
We will take him and go.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.174
He will not last.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.584
( groans )

27:18.762 --> 27:21.595
I need but a moment.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.175
You shall have it.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.090
The man meets his end.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.634
That is all that matters.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.938
(men grunting)

27:33.193 --> 27:34.694
- ( metal ringing)
- Man: Go!

27:34.862 --> 27:37.148
(sobbing )

27:37.322 --> 27:39.483
You brokered the sale of a woman

27:39.658 --> 27:42.274
from the house of Batiatus,

27:42.452 --> 27:44.192
dark of skin,

27:44.371 --> 27:48.364
the mark of the domina
upon the back of her shoulder.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.622
Where is she?

27:53.755 --> 27:55.746
Fuck yourself.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.755
I'm already dead.

27:58.969 --> 28:01.711
( groans )

28:04.349 --> 28:07.682
There is life in you yet.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.686
Speak, and see it
ended quickly.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.472
(gasping )

28:21.950 --> 28:23.656
Spartacus: South?

28:23.827 --> 28:26.239
There are villas and farms

28:26.413 --> 28:27.619
far from the city.

28:27.789 --> 28:29.745
And Naevia was sold
to one of them?

28:29.917 --> 28:32.704
No. She was handed
from dominus to dominus,

28:32.878 --> 28:35.585
a gift from Batiatus
to secure favor

28:35.756 --> 28:37.121
on his campaign
for fucking aedile.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.585
These places you speak of,

28:39.760 --> 28:41.751
how heavily are they guarded?

28:41.929 --> 28:43.544
It would not matter
if the gods stood watch.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.337
How many villas are there
in the south?

28:45.515 --> 28:47.642
Over what spread of distance?

28:47.809 --> 28:49.970
How will you know if Naevia's
even located in one of them?

28:50.145 --> 28:52.477
Only a few are owned
by men of note,

28:52.648 --> 28:56.232
cocks Batiatus would have sucked
to further his cause.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.312
We'd be exposed,
in the open.

28:58.487 --> 29:00.227
We must proceed
with caution.

29:00.405 --> 29:01.440
(sighs)

29:01.615 --> 29:04.322
You advising caution?

29:04.493 --> 29:06.484
The tempest shouts
for the breeze to calm itself!

29:06.662 --> 29:08.027
What good will
your death be to Naevia

29:08.205 --> 29:09.911
if we do not pause to think?

29:10.082 --> 29:12.243
She has been
from my arms too long.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.659
I do not have time
to sit and ponder.

29:15.837 --> 29:18.123
None of us do now.

29:18.298 --> 29:19.913
What is your meaning?

29:22.594 --> 29:25.802
With his last breath,
Trebius frothed of Rome

29:27.266 --> 29:29.803
and the death that has been
dispatched from her bosom

29:29.977 --> 29:32.468
to wash us away
in rivers of blood.

29:32.646 --> 29:33.852
Soldiers.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.729
Arriving with the sun.

29:39.861 --> 29:42.113
Who leads them?

29:42.281 --> 29:44.317
( neighs )

30:13.478 --> 30:15.343
The city is in a panic.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.229
Scores were slaughtered
in the raid against Arminius.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.140
Halt!

30:20.319 --> 30:23.152
See the men fed and rested.

30:23.322 --> 30:26.155
Squads to sweep the countryside
by nightfall.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.861
Your will, Praetor.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.321
Fallout! Break supplies!

30:32.748 --> 30:35.581
(shouting orders)

30:35.751 --> 30:38.117
Do you have enough men for this?

30:41.089 --> 30:42.829
It does not appear
you have enough men.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.881
They face only slaves,

30:46.053 --> 30:47.384
not Hannibal at the gates.

30:47.554 --> 30:50.045
They are gladiators,
led by Spartacus,

30:50.223 --> 30:52.179
- the Slayer of the Shadow of--
- Where is the magistrate?

30:52.351 --> 30:54.216
I would discuss this
with someone of note.

30:54.394 --> 30:57.852
He was otherwise detained,
in view of last night's--

30:58.023 --> 30:59.729
He sends apologies.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.016
Seppius, however,
is eager for audience.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.901
The man has
Praetor Varinius's ear.

31:05.072 --> 31:07.939
l have no desire for his tongue
to fill mine as well.

31:11.828 --> 31:14.160
I would address the people,
put their minds to ease,

31:14.331 --> 31:16.743
tomorrow as the sun rises
in the marketplace.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.873
( laughs )
What will you say?

31:19.044 --> 31:21.831
Attend to the arrangements.

31:22.005 --> 31:23.870
Yes, Praeto r.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.131
Why have I been brought here?

31:34.393 --> 31:37.851
Gaius, why have I
been brought here?

31:38.021 --> 31:39.010
To this house?

31:39.189 --> 31:40.304
The hilltop offers

31:40.482 --> 31:42.894
excellent vantage
of the surrounding country.

31:43.068 --> 31:45.275
The ludus below will easily
garrison my men.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.981
Then use it as such.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.942
I will remove myself
to my father's villa.

31:53.120 --> 31:57.113
You will stay at my side.

32:01.878 --> 32:05.120
Now, set the house to order.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.383
This is our home now, llithyia.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.092
Until Spartacus falls.

32:17.310 --> 32:20.643
I want everything
in this fucking house

32:20.814 --> 32:22.896
seen over the cliff.

32:23.066 --> 32:26.650
We will purchase
new appointments of much coin.

32:26.820 --> 32:28.811
If my husband
would have me here,

32:28.989 --> 32:31.526
he can certainly pay
for the comfort.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.533
And see all traces
of blood cleansed.

32:34.703 --> 32:38.537
lt reeks of Batiatus
and his faded bitch.

32:38.707 --> 32:41.449
- Go! Go!
- Yes, Domina.

33:11.531 --> 33:14.443
( laughter)

33:17.329 --> 33:19.320
(moaning)

33:40.060 --> 33:43.928
( screams )

33:44.105 --> 33:45.311
What has happened?

33:45.482 --> 33:46.938
ln matters concerning my wife,

33:47.108 --> 33:49.019
the gods themselves
fear to speculate.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.361
(shuddering )

33:55.283 --> 33:56.898
Have you lost wit?

33:59.162 --> 34:01.369
Speak.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.793
You should have sent word
you were coming.

34:14.094 --> 34:17.006
We would have prepared a feast.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.128
Lucretia.

34:19.307 --> 34:20.808
You see it, then?

34:22.102 --> 34:24.809
- You see it?
- ( claps hands ) Naevia,

34:24.980 --> 34:26.720
bring wine
for our honored guests.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.401
Kill it. Kill it! Kill it!

34:33.572 --> 34:35.028
Praeto r!

34:35.198 --> 34:36.574
This is Batiatus's wife?

34:40.078 --> 34:42.444
A shadow of the same.

34:42.622 --> 34:44.078
And yet she lives.

34:44.249 --> 34:45.659
To be spared from such carnage,

34:45.834 --> 34:47.040
a blessing from the gods,

34:47.210 --> 34:50.043
one that would calm a city,
if it were known to be such.

34:50.213 --> 34:51.669
Naevia!

34:51.840 --> 34:54.047
Apologies.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.211
I do not know
where she's gone.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.089
Lucretia: What...

35:03.268 --> 35:04.929
Why do you pause?

35:05.103 --> 35:07.515
She could prove
a powerful symbol.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.054
It would give the city hope

35:09.232 --> 35:11.188
to see a woman
survive Spartacus and his men

35:11.359 --> 35:13.020
and courage to confront them,

35:13.194 --> 35:15.321
speeding your return to Rome.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.700
Gaius...

35:21.870 --> 35:24.202
you cannot let her live.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.960
See her bathed and tended

35:32.130 --> 35:35.418
and what fragments
her shattered mind yet holds.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.085
( Lucretia muttering )

35:44.267 --> 35:46.644
- The Roman army?!
- We are all of us dead!

35:46.811 --> 35:49.063
- Grab your fucking cock.
- We never wanted this!

35:49.230 --> 35:51.095
You gladiators,
you will see us all to our end.

35:51.274 --> 35:53.890
- You little fuck.
- Agron!

36:02.327 --> 36:04.409
We knew this day would come.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.163
Some have feared its approach.

36:10.251 --> 36:13.163
Others have longed for it.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.713
Yet few have grasped
deeper meaning...

36:19.511 --> 36:21.342
that this moment...

36:22.972 --> 36:25.714
was always fated to be so.

36:28.853 --> 36:31.686
I made promise to all of you

36:31.856 --> 36:34.643
when the house of Batiatus fell...

36:36.319 --> 36:38.605
that we would
see Rome tremble.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.362
Doctore: You are the ones
that shall quake.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.820
(murmuring)

36:48.248 --> 36:52.082
l have witnessed Glaber
and his men entering the city,

36:52.252 --> 36:57.337
enough in number
to end your lives.

36:59.759 --> 37:03.627
Then stand with us,
and balance the odds.

37:04.848 --> 37:08.011
Mercato has announced
Glaber will make address

37:08.184 --> 37:10.140
in the market as day breaks.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.597
It would be wise to use
the distraction

37:12.772 --> 37:15.559
andleave
such thoughts behind.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.232
Doctore!

37:20.447 --> 37:23.780
That is no longer my title.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.281
Where do you go?

37:27.078 --> 37:29.069
There is but one place

37:29.247 --> 37:31.078
for an animal without honor.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.243
(murmuring)

37:36.421 --> 37:37.957
He is lost to us.

37:38.131 --> 37:39.667
How many more
would you have follow?

37:39.841 --> 37:41.297
- ( sobbing )
- Come on.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.174
Join with us, brother.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.550
We can head south

37:44.721 --> 37:46.382
while Glaber cups his balls
and makes speeches.

37:46.556 --> 37:49.013
He's the reason I am here

37:49.184 --> 37:51.345
and my wife forever absent.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.851
You often preach to me
aboutcauﬁon.

37:54.022 --> 37:55.637
Turn advice now towards self.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.147
- We are ready.
- ( gasping )

37:58.318 --> 38:01.276
House slaves
playing at being men.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.653
They are not gladiators.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.360
They are not an army,
as much you wish it to be so.

38:11.498 --> 38:14.114
Sleep upon it, Spartacus,

38:14.292 --> 38:16.283
but when the sun rises,

38:16.461 --> 38:18.497
I would see reason dawn.

38:32.435 --> 38:34.050
Lucretia: Water.

38:34.229 --> 38:37.062
How did we come by it,
with the drought?

38:38.441 --> 38:40.352
llithyia: Drought is long past.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.768
Do you not recall its ending?

38:46.741 --> 38:50.029
It is of no concern. Come.

38:50.203 --> 38:53.491
lwould have you dry
and seen to proper dress.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.842
Your wound.

39:05.969 --> 39:06.958
Wound?

39:07.136 --> 39:09.218
How did you come by it?

39:21.693 --> 39:23.900
Leave us.

39:32.829 --> 39:35.115
It must have been terrible...

39:36.374 --> 39:38.490
trapped within these walls,

39:38.668 --> 39:41.410
your beasts running wild.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.000
Everyone believed you dead,

39:45.174 --> 39:48.337
smashed upon the cliffs,

39:48.511 --> 39:52.379
bits of bone and flesh...

39:53.391 --> 39:55.552
your only testament.

39:57.770 --> 40:01.354
How did you survive all alone?

40:04.360 --> 40:06.316
Lucretia.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.942
We are friends, are we not?

40:11.743 --> 40:13.950
The very best.

40:16.372 --> 40:19.409
And you have so many--

40:19.584 --> 40:22.496
Aemilia, Caecilia...

40:24.380 --> 40:25.756
...Licinia.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.422
Cousin to Marcus Crassus.

40:32.722 --> 40:35.964
It would be a very great honor
to be seen at her side.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.303
Would you make introduction?

40:43.483 --> 40:45.895
Let us see you dressed.

40:46.903 --> 40:47.938
llithyia.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.275
Why didn't you tell me?

40:56.496 --> 40:59.363
You're with child.

41:04.337 --> 41:07.625
Quintus and l have been trying
for such a long time.

41:10.051 --> 41:11.461
This is a sign,

41:11.636 --> 41:13.797
a sign from the gods.

41:19.936 --> 41:22.894
Life blossoms
in the house of Batiatus.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.906
This is why
we are yet in Capua...

41:37.704 --> 41:40.195
why you saw Aurelia away.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.742
You hoped
they would send Glaber.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.669
No.

41:46.879 --> 41:49.040
I prayed for it.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.881
And what do you pray for now

41:56.055 --> 41:59.013
to the gods
you do not believe in?

42:01.436 --> 42:03.643
Would your wife
have wanted this?

42:05.523 --> 42:07.354
To see her husband
consumed?

42:07.525 --> 42:09.857
There are many things
she would not have wanted,

42:10.028 --> 42:12.269
and yet they are so.

42:14.824 --> 42:17.281
Follow Crixus to the south.

42:19.162 --> 42:21.118
Do not let your vengeance

42:21.289 --> 42:23.621
claim so many
you have saved from bondage.

42:34.177 --> 42:37.635
I would not see another life
forfeit to my desires.

42:52.779 --> 42:55.361
We will find Naevia

42:55.531 --> 42:58.944
and move far beyond
the grasp of Rome...

43:01.788 --> 43:05.121
far from the name Spartacus
they have branded you with.

43:07.710 --> 43:11.123
Let us turn thought
from uncertain future

43:11.297 --> 43:14.710
and embrace
fleeting moment.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.894
Get up!
Move to fucking purpose.

43:29.065 --> 43:31.147
Be ready when word is given.

43:31.317 --> 43:33.103
You bark as a dominus.

43:33.277 --> 43:35.063
Sheep stand idle
if not prodded by snapping jaw.

43:35.238 --> 43:37.320
- Lazy fuck.
- Get up!

43:37.490 --> 43:39.355
Does the maw from a pup
spur the same?

43:39.534 --> 43:41.616
( laughter)

43:41.786 --> 43:44.152
Let us compare teeth
and have answer.

43:44.330 --> 43:46.662
Cease your quarrels.

43:46.833 --> 43:49.996
I am for Spartacus
and the lay of his thoughts.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.909
Last night, they were
towards heeding caution

43:52.088 --> 43:54.750
and joining you in the south.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.539
And in the light of morning?

43:59.762 --> 44:02.845
He was gone from our bed
when I awoke.

44:05.685 --> 44:08.518
(crowd murmuring)

44:08.688 --> 44:11.555
Magistrate: There is no cause
for rising concerns!

44:11.732 --> 44:14.439
The situation
is well in control!

44:14.610 --> 44:15.986
What of Arminius?!

44:16.154 --> 44:17.485
Is that fucking control?!

44:17.655 --> 44:19.156
Seppius: No!

44:21.909 --> 44:23.774
It was an act of savagery,

44:23.953 --> 44:28.117
committed by animals
who know nothing more.

44:29.417 --> 44:33.376
These same beasts laid waste
to the house of Batiatus.

44:33.546 --> 44:35.787
Many were lost that night,

44:35.965 --> 44:38.047
women of proper standing,

44:38.217 --> 44:40.799
men of honor and position,

44:40.970 --> 44:43.131
my own cousin Sextus,

44:43.306 --> 44:45.922
your beloved magistrate
of years past,

44:46.100 --> 44:47.886
among the dead.

44:48.060 --> 44:49.186
- ( murmuring)
- He speaks the truth!

44:49.353 --> 44:51.969
At the hands of butchers,

44:52.148 --> 44:54.560
who crave only blood and death.

44:54.734 --> 44:58.318
And they shall see it
returned in kind.

45:02.742 --> 45:04.278
But Spartacus leads them!

45:04.452 --> 45:06.443
Even Theokoles fell before him!

45:07.705 --> 45:09.616
He's the Bringer of Rain!

45:09.790 --> 45:13.499
Spartacus is but a man,

45:13.669 --> 45:17.161
and not all fall to his touch.

45:18.507 --> 45:22.716
The wife
of Quintus Lentulus Batiatus

45:22.887 --> 45:25.594
stood against
the merciless assault

45:25.765 --> 45:28.882
of Spartacus and his dogs,

45:29.060 --> 45:31.972
and by favor of the gods...

45:33.522 --> 45:35.228
she yet lives.

45:50.665 --> 45:52.576
Woman: It's a miracle!

45:52.750 --> 45:54.331
- Gods be praised!
- ( gasping )

45:54.502 --> 45:56.993
- It is a blessing!
- ( murmuring)

46:01.259 --> 46:04.592
You stand eclipsed.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.884
You ought to shed
a fucking tear.

46:09.058 --> 46:12.300
She is their herald...

46:13.479 --> 46:17.392
plucked from the shores
of the afterlife

46:17.566 --> 46:19.397
to deliver a message

46:19.568 --> 46:23.106
that Spartacus
shall never triumph

46:23.281 --> 46:26.739
over the people of Capua!

46:26.909 --> 46:29.025
( cheering )

46:35.960 --> 46:37.996
He comes.

46:38.170 --> 46:41.662
He comes.
He comes.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.706
- He comes.
- Still yourself.

46:43.884 --> 46:48.594
And yet the gods
grace us with further signs

46:48.764 --> 46:52.928
that Spartacus's end is near.

46:55.813 --> 46:58.179
Woman: Burn! Burn!
Just fucking burn her!

46:58.357 --> 47:00.348
( crowd jeering )

47:03.195 --> 47:05.902
Man: Open her guts
onto the ground!

47:09.952 --> 47:11.567
Hack that bitch! Fuck her!

47:14.790 --> 47:17.497
- Get rid of her!
- Gut the cunt!

47:30.848 --> 47:34.136
My men came upon
a clutch of Batiatus' slaves

47:34.310 --> 47:38.474
attempting harm
in the mountains to the east.

47:39.774 --> 47:41.435
( gasps )

47:41.609 --> 47:46.069
This one is all that remains
amongst the living.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.856
Before she succumbs
to her wounds,

47:50.034 --> 47:52.776
I will force
her tongue to purpose,

47:52.953 --> 47:55.080
and with her dying breath,

47:55.247 --> 47:57.033
she will tell me

47:57.208 --> 48:00.416
where Spartacus and his men
hide themselves.

48:01.962 --> 48:06.422
And they shall be struck
from this mortal world

48:06.592 --> 48:12.883
by the hand
of Gaius Claudius Glaber!

48:13.057 --> 48:15.093
( cheering )

48:15.267 --> 48:18.395
Glaber! Glaber! Glaber!

48:18.562 --> 48:20.894
Glaber! Glaber! Glaber!

48:21.065 --> 48:22.976
Glaber! Glaber! Glaber!

48:23.150 --> 48:25.641
( cheering )

48:27.071 --> 48:28.186
Preening little shit.

48:28.364 --> 48:30.605
I rather favor him.

48:30.783 --> 48:33.115
As I favor the shade
of our villa.

48:33.285 --> 48:34.411
(giggles)

48:35.538 --> 48:37.324
Thank you.

48:45.673 --> 48:48.164
- Yaah!
- ( screams )

48:55.808 --> 48:58.049
(yelling)

49:25.921 --> 49:28.037
Surround him!

49:34.180 --> 49:35.169
Seize him!

49:36.724 --> 49:38.589
Spartacus!

50:00.706 --> 50:02.207
Seize him!

50:04.210 --> 50:05.666
Take Aurelia and go!

50:26.148 --> 50:28.059
- Where is Naevia?
- ( screams )

50:39.954 --> 50:41.364
Take him!

50:45.834 --> 50:47.210
You cannot win this!

50:52.216 --> 50:55.299
Stay, and see vengeance
forever denied.

51:10.276 --> 51:12.892
You are no better than Rhaskos
and the fucking Gauls.

51:13.070 --> 51:16.028
All driven
only by your own desires.

51:16.198 --> 51:18.940
Do any of us hold
fucking worth to you?

51:19.118 --> 51:20.574
The reason I went alone.

51:20.744 --> 51:24.202
A hard comfort, if you had
fallen to Glaber's men.

51:24.373 --> 51:25.829
Agron would have led you south.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.115
We need a leader,

51:27.293 --> 51:30.205
not some angry boy
who can barely piss

51:30.379 --> 51:31.835
without splashing
everyone about him.

51:32.006 --> 51:33.587
What would you have me do?

51:33.757 --> 51:38.046
Turn from the man that condemned
my wife to slavery?

51:38.220 --> 51:41.053
Let him live,

51:41.223 --> 51:44.386
that took everything from me?

51:49.690 --> 51:53.057
Your heart still beats.

51:53.235 --> 51:56.102
Place ear to chest,

51:56.280 --> 51:59.067
and you will find it
absent sound.

52:01.118 --> 52:03.951
And yet you are not dead.

52:06.707 --> 52:08.322
Because of you.

52:08.500 --> 52:10.627
Know that you have my gratitude.

52:13.213 --> 52:15.124
I didn't come to lend you aid,
you mad fuck.

52:15.299 --> 52:17.255
-(coughs)
- I came to stop you.

52:20.554 --> 52:23.887
You would place yourself between
Glaber and what he deserves?

52:24.058 --> 52:28.347
As you would place yourself
between Naevia and me.

52:30.189 --> 52:32.521
What do you think
would be the result

52:32.691 --> 52:36.149
of killing a fucking praetor?

52:36.320 --> 52:38.231
The Senate would burn upon itself,

52:38.405 --> 52:41.112
belching forth fire and vengeance.

52:41.283 --> 52:43.865
They would not send a few men,
as they do with Glaber.

52:44.036 --> 52:45.242
They would send thousands,

52:45.412 --> 52:47.403
a true army...

52:48.957 --> 52:50.788
which we will never be.

52:54.380 --> 52:56.792
( footsteps )

52:58.967 --> 53:01.253
Aurelia calls for you.

53:18.487 --> 53:20.648
(gasping )

53:22.199 --> 53:23.405
Spartacus.

53:23.575 --> 53:26.032
I am here.

53:30.124 --> 53:31.330
Promise me...

53:31.500 --> 53:33.331
Anything.

53:35.421 --> 53:36.877
Promise...

53:37.047 --> 53:39.254
you will stay far from my son.

53:42.261 --> 53:45.253
I would not have him die
in your wake...

53:47.099 --> 53:49.431
as his father

53:49.601 --> 53:51.341
and mother.

54:25.846 --> 54:29.134
Glaber and his men
will pay in blood.

54:30.350 --> 54:31.851
Gather swords.

54:32.019 --> 54:33.600
No.

54:37.065 --> 54:38.441
We move south...

54:41.278 --> 54:42.939
to find Naevia.

54:44.072 --> 54:47.235
Let Crixus and the other Gauls
chase lost hope.

54:47.409 --> 54:49.525
- Spartacus--
- The decision's been made.

54:52.790 --> 54:54.826
We must stand as one...

54:58.378 --> 55:01.745
or fall divided.

55:07.304 --> 55:09.966
A lesson hard learned.

55:11.642 --> 55:13.178
Shackle will be struck

55:13.352 --> 55:15.968
from every slave
upon our path.

55:16.146 --> 55:19.513
We will see
our numbers grow,

55:19.691 --> 55:23.183
and when they
have become legion,

55:23.362 --> 55:25.569
we will face Glaber

55:25.739 --> 55:29.072
and the hordes of Rome again,

55:29.243 --> 55:32.235
and the gods shall weep
for their suffering.
