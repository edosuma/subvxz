00:01.392 --> 00:03.307
<i>Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:03.351 --> 00:05.048
If you're gonna
save your world,

00:05.092 --> 00:07.050
<i>you have to work
with Lex Luthor.</i>

00:07.094 --> 00:09.792
<i>You must give up everyone
that you hold dear.</i>

00:09.835 --> 00:12.621
Lex Luthor has launched
32 satellites to space.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.927
<i>Well, Lex and Leviathan
are planning something</i>

00:14.971 --> 00:17.060
<i>using Obsidian's
virtually reality platform.</i>

00:17.104 --> 00:18.888
And my tech likely
made that possible.

00:18.931 --> 00:21.543
I am a god.
You are nothing.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.023
Do you understand?

00:23.066 --> 00:24.850
I thought it was
forbidden to use Myriad.

00:24.894 --> 00:28.071
What I'm doing
is finding people
your brother disappeared.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.855
Humanity can't be fixed.

00:29.899 --> 00:31.770
<i>They need to be controlled.</i>

00:31.814 --> 00:35.861
I want to help
stop Lex and Leviathan.

00:35.905 --> 00:39.604
Wow.
This is amazing.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.606
<i>Rather than
kill the gods,</i>

00:41.650 --> 00:42.999
<i>I'll shrink them.</i>

00:43.043 --> 00:45.436
<i>You gave me exactly
what I needed.</i>

00:45.480 --> 00:47.134
<i>I'm just gonna
kill Supergirl myself.</i>

00:47.177 --> 00:49.049
It's Brainy. He needs my help.

01:22.212 --> 01:25.041
Guys, I think I'm close
to finding Brainy.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.391
I've dropped a pin
at my location.

01:27.435 --> 01:28.958
I just hope I'm not too late.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.572
-Brainy!
Nia.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.444
Let me in.

01:36.487 --> 01:37.662
Can't.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.665
Yeah. Yes, you can.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.798
-There's a panel.
You can hit it.
-Radiation.

01:42.841 --> 01:45.409
I'm not gonna let you die.

01:45.453 --> 01:47.716
Nia, you should hear this.

01:49.196 --> 01:54.549
You have to work
with Lex to destroy Leviathan.

01:54.592 --> 01:57.160
Pushing you away, hurting you,

01:58.335 --> 01:59.945
it was to protect you.

02:01.947 --> 02:04.950
I love you.

02:04.994 --> 02:07.475
No, you're not getting
off the hook that easily.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.666
<i>You.</i>

02:24.709 --> 02:26.711
You didn't die?

02:26.755 --> 02:29.671
<i>You cannot kill technology,</i>

02:30.846 --> 02:34.241
<i>but technology can kill you.</i>

02:56.350 --> 02:58.090
Alex.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.962
I'll get Alex and Brainy
out of here.

03:05.707 --> 03:06.838
Where'd she go?

03:08.449 --> 03:09.928
She's in
the computer.

03:16.108 --> 03:18.502
I've got them.
You get back in there.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.951
This is Martian nanites
laced with potassium iodide.

03:32.995 --> 03:34.779
It's gonna give your system
a chance to repair itself

03:34.823 --> 03:36.520
now that you're out
of that room.

03:36.564 --> 03:37.956
But it's not gonna be fun.

03:42.874 --> 03:46.356
Gamemnae.
I know how to stop her.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.879
The Anti-Life Equation.

03:52.362 --> 03:53.885
Leviathan were ancient aliens,

03:53.929 --> 03:55.757
but Gamemnae's
a technological being,

03:55.800 --> 03:57.106
which is exactly what

03:57.149 --> 03:59.151
the Anti-Life Equation
was designed for.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.892
All we need
is a method of uploading it

04:00.936 --> 04:03.155
into that center console,

04:03.199 --> 04:05.245
which has to be
the ship's command hub.

04:05.288 --> 04:06.202
Like this?

04:10.467 --> 04:12.643
Yes. Brilliant.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.795
-Supergirl.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.623
Put this in the center console.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.993
Everyone out now!

05:07.611 --> 05:10.875
<i>The Leviathan energy transfer
has been initiated.</i>

05:16.272 --> 05:17.186
Are you all right?

05:24.062 --> 05:25.803
I'd say I'm more
than all right.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.160
Now you're just showing off.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.205
Not yet.

05:53.265 --> 05:56.356
To think you said
you weren't obsessed
with the Kryptonians.

06:00.098 --> 06:02.318
I told Lena
that she had it right.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.277
Aliens shouldn't be
Earth's saviors.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.322
A Luther should.

06:07.454 --> 06:08.629
And now I will be.

06:08.672 --> 06:11.196
Leviathan is gone.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.418
Next, I'll get rid of
the Kryptonian
and all her friends,

06:15.462 --> 06:17.420
and then the non-believers.

06:17.464 --> 06:20.945
And once I fix this planet,
I'll do what the Anti-Monitor
failed to do.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.426
Fix every other planet
in the universe.

06:23.470 --> 06:26.124
Well, that sounds
like a good plan.

06:26.168 --> 06:29.998
Please get back to the part
about ridding this planet
of the non-believers.

06:30.041 --> 06:34.872
Leviathan intended
to use Obsidian Platinum
to kill people in VR.

06:34.916 --> 06:39.137
Instead, I used Obsidian
to upgrade people's brains
in perpetuity.

06:39.181 --> 06:42.619
A little thing I like to call,
I Love Lexi.

06:42.663 --> 06:46.493
-That's very
alliterative, dear.
-Thank you.

06:46.536 --> 06:49.757
I knew that fixing this planet
would require big moves

06:49.800 --> 06:51.498
that not everyone
would appreciate.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.849
So, I took advantage
of Lena's delivery system

06:54.892 --> 06:59.854
to make sure
that everyone in VR
would always appreciate me,

07:00.768 --> 07:02.204
no matter what I do.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.728
And what about the people
who were not in VR?

07:04.772 --> 07:08.384
The ones unenlightened
to the goodness that is my son?

07:08.428 --> 07:11.256
The satellites I launched
during the Obsidian World Tour

07:11.300 --> 07:14.390
are armed with sonic weapons
poised to obliterate the minds

07:14.434 --> 07:16.958
of anyone who didn't get
the I Love Lexi upgrade.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.613
My satellites will be aligned

07:19.656 --> 07:23.399
to beam the kill frequency
in about five hours.

07:23.443 --> 07:27.577
I assume I will be safe without
being brainwashed to love you,

07:27.621 --> 07:28.970
since I already do.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.450
Course, Mother.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.060
There's a special do-hickey
with your name on it.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.105
And your sister.
You can't kill her either.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.499
Why not? She killed me first.

07:36.543 --> 07:40.111
If you hurt your sister
in any way, I will turn on you.

07:40.155 --> 07:43.027
And no amount
of brainwashing will stop me.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.420
You'll be all alone,

07:44.464 --> 07:47.423
save for the sycophants
you detest.

07:47.467 --> 07:51.296
Think of how tragic
your father's demise was.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.124
Is that how you want to end up?

07:55.649 --> 07:56.998
Save your sister.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.137
I just got your signal.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.140
Where are Eve and the others?

08:09.184 --> 08:11.273
William took her
and her mom to CatCo.

08:11.316 --> 08:12.927
She agreed to go on the record,

08:12.970 --> 08:15.146
tell him everything
she knows about Lex.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.932
Well, that's amazing,
but does William really think

08:17.975 --> 08:19.847
any article about Lex
is gonna help right now?

08:19.890 --> 08:23.415
How is that possible?
Everybody thinks Lex is a hero.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.026
I think
it's worse than that.

08:25.069 --> 08:27.028
The program
I was developing
was supposed

08:27.071 --> 08:30.205
to expand the human mind,
to do no harm.

08:30.248 --> 08:33.861
It was on
the Obsidian platform,
but I think...

08:35.166 --> 08:36.777
I think Lex reworked it.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.475
Rewiring the human mind
so that they adored Lex

08:39.519 --> 08:41.172
when they were in
the Unity Festival.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.523
That's half
the world's population.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.133
What about the other half?

08:45.176 --> 08:47.483
Eve told me about an experiment
that Lex did on two mice.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.486
<i>One had gold eyes,
and it adored him,</i>

08:50.530 --> 08:53.141
and the other...

08:53.184 --> 08:58.842
Lex emitted some radiation
from a Q-wave antenna onto it
and it exploded.

08:58.886 --> 09:02.890
I saw people's eyes flash gold
when they were coming
out of the VR.

09:02.933 --> 09:06.154
That's why he launched
those satellites
during his world tour.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.783
Dreamer.
What did you dream?

09:26.827 --> 09:28.611
I saw Lex as the Anti-Monitor.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.266
He was destroying
every planet in existence.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.882
I have located
Lex's satellites.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.623
Twelve of them
orbiting the Earth.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.104
Each armed with
Claymore cannons
to fire on hard targets

09:43.147 --> 09:45.106
should any one of them
be tampered with.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.629
It would appear the only way
to shut them down

09:46.673 --> 09:49.414
would be to shut them
all down at the same time.

09:49.458 --> 09:51.286
But only four of us can fly.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.593
Synchronizing our movements,
too, could prove impossible.

09:53.636 --> 09:56.117
We could shut it down
with the Dorkri Surth-Uh.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.423
The what?

09:58.467 --> 10:01.252
A Martian ritual
which translates
to "the binding".

10:01.296 --> 10:03.211
And you could use this
on the satellites?

10:03.254 --> 10:07.171
It would require M'gann
and I to join our minds,
synchronize our thoughts.

10:07.215 --> 10:09.521
We could create
a web of psychic energy

10:09.565 --> 10:13.656
that we could literally
bind onto things
and move them in unison.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.266
We can do it.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.094
Okay, but even
if you stopped the satellites,

10:17.138 --> 10:20.010
half the people out there
are still gonna be
brainwashed by Lex.

10:20.054 --> 10:23.187
Lena, if you had
the code Lex used,

10:23.231 --> 10:25.146
could you reverse it
using Myriad?

10:26.974 --> 10:28.628
Myriad. Yes, but...

10:30.151 --> 10:32.762
You'd trust me?
Even after everything?

10:32.806 --> 10:34.459
You want to help people.

10:34.503 --> 10:37.898
Whatever else has happened,
I know what's in your heart.

10:37.941 --> 10:42.032
I will go to Obsidian,
download the server
database into a hard drive

10:42.076 --> 10:43.468
and get it to you.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.557
Well,
that solves two problems.

10:45.601 --> 10:48.909
Now, if we only knew
how to make Lex mortal again.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.345
We need his Kryptonite.

10:52.173 --> 10:55.045
Not Kryptonite, Jarhanpurium.

10:56.525 --> 10:59.702
Fragments of that planet
must have made it to Earth.

10:59.746 --> 11:02.574
It would be toxic to Lex,
just like Kryptonite is
to Supergirl.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.142
But finding it would be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

11:05.186 --> 11:06.709
That's what my dream was about.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.973
There was a green bottle,
Kryptonite green.

11:10.017 --> 11:11.671
I could invert
the energy in the bottle,

11:11.714 --> 11:13.803
run it through the machine
I used to make Kryptonite.

11:13.847 --> 11:16.066
Sprock. It could work.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.851
The monument
Supergirl was trapped in

11:17.894 --> 11:20.984
on Shelley Island
was also in my dream.
The bottle must be there.

11:21.028 --> 11:24.379
It's the same energy station
Lex used last year
on Earth-38.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.035
-I'll go.
-No, you're still too weak.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.907
-I'll go.
-And I'll go with you.

11:30.951 --> 11:33.388
Brainy, you and Lena
work on Myriad
and her Kryptonite machine

11:33.431 --> 11:35.999
for when we bring
you back that bottle.

11:36.043 --> 11:37.522
I'll get Myriad
from the Fortress.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.307
And there's got to be
something there

11:39.350 --> 11:41.352
we can use to weaponize
the Jarhanpurium.

11:41.396 --> 11:43.093
That way we can
strip Lex of his powers

11:43.137 --> 11:44.529
and make him mortal again.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.967
Let's not forget,

11:47.010 --> 11:49.186
Lex still wants to kill us all.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.362
And he has Leviathan powers,

11:51.406 --> 11:54.801
which means he can sense us,
especially Supergirl.

11:54.844 --> 11:58.239
He'll strike as soon as
we try to make a move.
We need another diversion.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.763
I can buy you guys time
by offering myself up.

12:00.807 --> 12:03.200
We're not gonna
let you do that, Supergirl.
It's too risky.

12:03.244 --> 12:07.422
If that's what it takes
to save half the population
and stop Lex,

12:07.465 --> 12:09.424
I'm willing to take that risk.

12:17.649 --> 12:21.218
Your sister is still MIA.
You shouldn't be celebrating.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.220
You should be out there
looking for her.

12:23.264 --> 12:26.528
Can't, Mother.
If I calculated correctly,

12:26.571 --> 12:30.010
we should be getting
a call any moment.

12:30.053 --> 12:33.100
-Oh, see.

12:34.623 --> 12:37.669
Ah, the maid of might.
What a surprise.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.802
We know you've placed
satellites around the world,

12:39.846 --> 12:41.673
and when they sync up,
they'll send out a signal

12:41.717 --> 12:44.372
killing everyone
you haven't brainwashed.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.243
What do you want?
A gold star?

12:46.287 --> 12:48.811
I want you to disable
the satellites.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.901
You do that, I'll give you
what you've always wanted.

12:51.945 --> 12:55.470
What's that?
And don't say hair,
that's low-hanging fruit.

12:55.949 --> 12:56.863
Me.

12:58.299 --> 13:01.781
Well, that is tempting.

13:01.824 --> 13:04.392
I assume there's
no strings attached,

13:04.435 --> 13:07.090
no trap,
no attempt to outwit me.

13:07.134 --> 13:09.832
Or has the razzle dazzle
of my immortality

13:09.876 --> 13:12.574
made you forget that
I'm the smartest man alive?

13:12.617 --> 13:14.619
Do you really think I'd fall
for something so prosaic?

13:14.663 --> 13:16.230
I'm wearing a Truth Seeker,

13:16.273 --> 13:17.709
and I think
your obsession with me

13:17.753 --> 13:19.755
outweighs your desire
to kill half the world.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.540
I surrender.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.891
Name the place,
and bring a way
to disable satellites.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.153
Any place?

13:26.196 --> 13:28.068
As long as
no civilians get hurt.

13:28.111 --> 13:31.854
The Fortress. One hour.
I hear it's beautiful
this time of year.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.334
I'll send you the coordinates.

13:35.336 --> 13:39.819
You aren't actually considering
going to the Fortress, are you?

13:39.862 --> 13:41.255
Of course, it's a trap.

13:41.298 --> 13:44.475
Ah, no.
I'm taking advantage
of an opportunity.

13:44.519 --> 13:48.958
Supergirl hasn't seen
new, improved me
in action yet.

13:49.002 --> 13:52.135
I will destroy her.

13:52.179 --> 13:56.226
And while you're doing that,
her friends will be busy
undoing all your hard work.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.794
With Supergirl out of the way,
her friends will be
easy targets.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.144
And even if they're successful,
at stopping my satellites,

14:01.188 --> 14:03.973
I'm a god, Mother.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.541
I'll have plenty of time
to fix what they mess up.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.369
Oh, uh...

14:08.412 --> 14:10.284
and silver lining...

14:10.327 --> 14:13.809
if Supergirl's friends
go behind my back
and take down my satellites,

14:13.853 --> 14:16.159
you don't have to
worry about Lena.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.987
You see...

14:18.031 --> 14:20.250
it is time to celebrate.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.057
Andrea...

14:44.100 --> 14:45.536
What happened?

14:47.234 --> 14:49.714
My father, he...

14:49.758 --> 14:52.326
he blames me for everything.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.329
What do you mean?

14:56.069 --> 14:57.897
Just...

14:57.940 --> 14:59.376
Leviathan...

14:59.420 --> 15:03.728
hijacking our technology,
destroying our company.

15:03.772 --> 15:06.775
He said I destroyed his legacy.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.822
I'm so sorry.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.913
I sacrificed
everything for him.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.221
I sold my soul...

15:18.265 --> 15:21.224
to make Obsidian North
a success.

15:21.268 --> 15:23.792
Once the market
opens tomorrow I'll...

15:24.793 --> 15:26.882
I'll be bankrupt.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.059
Not just Obsidian,
but CatCo, too.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.974
Your father...

15:32.018 --> 15:34.237
is a selfish narcissist.

15:34.281 --> 15:37.066
You are a brilliant woman...

15:37.110 --> 15:40.504
who built this place
from sheer force of will.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.854
The mistake
was doing it for him.

15:51.994 --> 15:55.998
Well, I haven't seen you
this tense since...

15:56.042 --> 15:58.261
well, since the last time
the fate of the world

15:58.305 --> 16:00.220
rested on our shoulders.

16:00.263 --> 16:01.569
Redirecting those satellites

16:01.612 --> 16:03.614
isn't as simple
as melding minds.

16:03.658 --> 16:06.008
To engage
on that level requires

16:06.052 --> 16:07.879
complete openness.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.753
M'gann will see
everything about me.

16:12.754 --> 16:15.800
Memories of my daughter,
my wife...

16:17.846 --> 16:20.414
every violent thought
I've ever had...

16:20.457 --> 16:22.329
about white Martians...

16:24.070 --> 16:25.288
She will know things about me

16:25.332 --> 16:27.377
that I would
never choose to share.

16:27.421 --> 16:28.988
What if...

16:29.031 --> 16:30.641
subconsciously,

16:30.685 --> 16:32.774
my apprehensions derail us?

16:32.817 --> 16:35.385
We might not be able to
take those satellites offline,

16:35.429 --> 16:37.126
I could...

16:37.170 --> 16:38.780
kill both of us.

16:38.823 --> 16:43.002
J'onn, you have been through
so much in your life.

16:44.220 --> 16:45.743
War,

16:45.787 --> 16:47.223
loss,

16:47.267 --> 16:48.572
love.

16:48.616 --> 16:52.054
You've had to face
some hard truths.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.013
But so has M'gann.

16:54.578 --> 16:55.840
You know, I...

16:55.884 --> 16:57.668
I know it's easier said
than done,

16:57.712 --> 17:00.367
but at the end of the day,
all you can really do is trust.

17:01.194 --> 17:02.325
And who knows,

17:02.369 --> 17:03.848
engaging like this,

17:03.892 --> 17:07.678
being this open with M'gann,

17:07.722 --> 17:10.377
it could lead to
something really beautiful.

17:12.248 --> 17:15.295
I meant what I said before.

17:15.338 --> 17:18.515
I truly am
so sorry for everything.

17:19.212 --> 17:21.388
You hurt me, Brainy.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.868
You abandoned us.

17:23.912 --> 17:26.306
I know it was
to save the world but...

17:27.568 --> 17:29.091
What's the point
of saving anything

17:29.135 --> 17:31.572
if it means you have to
hurt the people who love you?

17:35.750 --> 17:38.405
Yeah. You're right.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.630
Take this.
It's a loaner...

17:46.674 --> 17:48.589
while I'm recovering.

17:51.026 --> 17:53.724
And the first step
in trying to...

17:53.768 --> 17:56.379
make up
for everything I've done.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.728
Who knows,

17:57.772 --> 17:59.861
it might be of service.

18:02.211 --> 18:05.084
<i>With Obsidian North
set to lose billions</i>

18:05.127 --> 18:07.390
<i>with the misfire
of their VR platform,</i>

18:07.434 --> 18:11.438
<i>Bernardo Rojas made
a stunning public rebuke
of his daughter</i>

18:11.481 --> 18:13.004
<i>in an interview earlier.</i>

18:27.280 --> 18:28.759
There's a section of the armory

18:28.803 --> 18:31.414
that's just artifacts
from the Andromeda Galaxy.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.374
-The Jarhanpurium weaponry
should be in there.
-Okay.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.638
I may be
able to reinforce
the anti-Luthor protocol.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.118
It won't kill Lex now
that he's immortal,

18:39.161 --> 18:40.989
-but it might slow him down...
-Lena...

18:41.032 --> 18:41.859
Kara,

18:41.903 --> 18:43.948
he's gonna try and kill you.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.254
All right?
I won't let you turn this

18:45.298 --> 18:47.126
into a suicide mission.
I can't.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.953
We've got no other choice.

18:48.997 --> 18:51.521
It's okay.
I've come to terms with it.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.610
As long as you guys
stop the satellites,

18:53.654 --> 18:55.482
and help everyone
with the Myriad...

18:56.265 --> 18:57.919
It'll be worth it.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.489
When Lex comes,

19:02.532 --> 19:05.927
you're gonna wanna
take the higher path,
but you know him.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.668
He plays dirty. Mean.
-Hm-mm.

19:07.711 --> 19:09.409
Maximizing the pain
wherever he can.

19:09.452 --> 19:11.150
Well, I was stuck
in the Phantom Zone

19:11.193 --> 19:13.152
replaying the destruction
of my planet

19:13.195 --> 19:14.370
for nearly a decade.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.155
Bring it on.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.463
We should probably...

19:20.507 --> 19:21.812
Kara.

19:22.944 --> 19:26.252
I know it wasn't easy
to trust me again.

19:26.295 --> 19:27.557
Especially with Myriad...

19:27.601 --> 19:28.645
You're the only person
in the galaxy

19:28.689 --> 19:30.604
I know would do right by it.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.085
Come on.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.120
I'm sorry, Father.

20:12.559 --> 20:14.474
I got the weapon.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.693
I'll go get Myriad.

20:16.737 --> 20:19.479
Oh, um, I'm gonna
borrow this portal watch.

20:19.522 --> 20:20.871
I think it could
come in handy.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.134
Yeah, as long as you return it.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.875
I always return
the things that I borrow.

20:24.919 --> 20:26.877
Oh, yeah? Tell that
to every graphic tee

20:26.921 --> 20:28.618
I owned from junior high on.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.623
You know, it is...

20:33.667 --> 20:36.322
it's just really nice
to see you working
with Lena again.

20:36.365 --> 20:38.585
Yeah.

20:38.628 --> 20:41.109
Yeah, we've got
a ways to go but...

20:41.718 --> 20:43.024
It is nice.

20:43.720 --> 20:46.549
I love you.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.684
Always.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.516
We have to go.

20:56.559 --> 20:57.778
Right.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.698
I will see you later.

21:05.786 --> 21:07.744
With this. Maybe.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.315
Good luck, Kara.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.795
You, too.

21:35.468 --> 21:38.384
I am Kara Zor-El.

21:38.427 --> 21:41.343
I'm entrusting a record
of all of my knowledge

21:41.387 --> 21:45.478
and experiences
into the crystals
you see before you...

21:45.521 --> 21:48.350
in the hope that they
will bring guidance to others,

21:48.394 --> 21:49.699
whenever they need it,

21:49.743 --> 21:51.962
now that I'm...

21:53.529 --> 21:55.096
now that I'm gone.

21:57.533 --> 22:00.928
This is my legacy download...

22:00.971 --> 22:03.974
Audio-visual, volume one.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.281
We have to make sure
that all the satellites

22:06.325 --> 22:09.676
are in exact alignment
to start the binding.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.853
-What's wrong?

22:13.375 --> 22:14.376
You realize,

22:14.420 --> 22:15.725
after this,

22:15.769 --> 22:18.119
win or lose,

22:18.162 --> 22:21.035
everything will be
different between us.

22:21.078 --> 22:23.864
Well, then we better
make this count.

22:41.664 --> 22:42.970
How's it coming?

22:44.885 --> 22:47.366
Kelly was able to access
Lex's code at Obsidian.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.411
Thus far, it's been easy enough
to reverse engineer,

22:49.455 --> 22:52.327
but the sequencing,
the control flow...

22:52.371 --> 22:54.416
the way Lex
was able to override free will

22:54.460 --> 22:56.070
with a few keystrokes...

22:56.984 --> 22:58.464
is quite terrifying.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.858
The code was my design...

23:03.294 --> 23:05.688
Are J'onn and M'gann
in position?

23:05.732 --> 23:07.647
Affirmative.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.126
And we're ready
to trigger Myriad

23:09.170 --> 23:10.867
as soon as they
take down all the satellites.

23:10.911 --> 23:13.435
Hopefully,
Supergirl will keep
Lex busy long enough

23:13.479 --> 23:15.219
so we can stop him.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.309
Lena, I...

23:20.094 --> 23:21.356
I need you to know that

23:21.400 --> 23:24.272
I had no idea
that this was Lex's plan.

23:24.315 --> 23:26.753
I thought that if...
if I was...

23:26.796 --> 23:29.712
close to him,
I would be able to know...

23:29.756 --> 23:32.541
how and when
to stop him, but I...

23:32.585 --> 23:34.717
I didn't.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.240
I was so worried that...

23:36.284 --> 23:38.068
by working with Lex
I was becoming the villain,

23:38.112 --> 23:39.983
that... that I lost track of...

23:40.027 --> 23:42.116
of what he was up to.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.597
I thought...

23:44.640 --> 23:47.338
that by doing this
I would help save the world,

23:47.382 --> 23:48.905
but...

23:48.949 --> 23:50.864
look what it's done...

23:53.344 --> 23:55.085
Brainy,

23:55.129 --> 23:57.566
you were willing
to sacrifice everything

23:57.610 --> 23:59.350
to save your friends.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.396
On the other hand,
I was the hypocrite

24:01.440 --> 24:04.617
who believed
that she had the answers
to all the world's problems.

24:04.660 --> 24:05.922
It's the closest I've ever come

24:05.966 --> 24:07.924
to seeing things
through Lex's eyes.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.796
Self-pity
and blinding hubris

24:09.839 --> 24:11.232
should be the
Luthor family motto.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.930
So if anyone's gonna win
the culpability award,

24:13.974 --> 24:15.932
I've got you by a landslide.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.414
What do we do now?

24:19.458 --> 24:23.157
Try and cope with
the mistakes of the past and...

24:23.200 --> 24:25.768
appreciate that we have friends
who still believe in us.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.251
Now let's go save the world.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.995
<i>Volume one is complete.</i>

24:35.038 --> 24:37.824
<i>Shall we move on
to volume two, Kara Zor-El?</i>

24:42.002 --> 24:43.960
Volume two?

24:44.004 --> 24:46.963
I suppose brevity
was never in your arsenal
of superpowers.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.269
Did you bring it?

24:48.312 --> 24:49.531
Behold...

24:49.575 --> 24:51.664
my remote controller...

24:51.707 --> 24:53.317
preloaded with the key codes

24:53.361 --> 24:55.450
to deactivate
every one of my birds
in the sky.

25:05.852 --> 25:08.724
Brainy's intel was spot-on.

25:08.768 --> 25:11.379
Let's find that bottle.

25:11.422 --> 25:12.728
Hey, little guys,

25:12.772 --> 25:16.558
Uncle Otis is gonna protect you
no matter what.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.821
Otis?
-Hand over the bottle.

25:20.649 --> 25:22.782
You didn't actually think
I was gonna give you

25:22.825 --> 25:24.523
the real key codes, did you?

25:24.566 --> 25:25.524
No!

25:25.567 --> 25:26.829
A word of advice?

25:26.873 --> 25:28.614
Next time you land
on somebody else's planet,

25:28.657 --> 25:32.574
try one where the sun
boosts your brain
and your brawn.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.489
Oh, but I just remembered...

25:34.533 --> 25:35.708
for you...

25:35.751 --> 25:37.753
there won't be a next time.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.674
The satellites
are coming into alignment.

26:11.134 --> 26:13.572
The signal...

26:16.009 --> 26:17.924
-It's the satellites...

26:26.280 --> 26:29.631
Aw, somebody got
a little boo-boo in their head?

26:29.675 --> 26:31.241
-No.

26:31.285 --> 26:34.114
We are not giving up.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.053
Okay.

27:00.096 --> 27:02.446
-J'onn and M'gann must've
shut down the satellites.
-Yeah.

27:02.490 --> 27:05.014
I'll activate Myriad
and restore normal
brain functions.

27:15.329 --> 27:18.767
I'm afraid
we haven't time for
any last words, Dream Girl...

27:18.811 --> 27:20.551
It's "Dreamer."

27:27.167 --> 27:29.560
-Who's got the headache now?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.436
Here.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.525
Let's hope we're not
too late for Kara.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.312
-What,

27:42.356 --> 27:45.315
no pleading,
no hopeful pontification

27:45.359 --> 27:47.622
about how I can change

27:47.666 --> 27:51.757
and learn to be
a better person...

27:53.062 --> 27:54.977
That's your problem, Kara...

27:55.021 --> 27:58.415
you, Leviathan,
you're all the same.

27:58.459 --> 28:02.028
Pushing an agenda,
trying to make humanity bend

28:02.071 --> 28:04.552
in ways that
it just doesn't want to.

28:04.595 --> 28:07.337
Yeah, like you tried
to bend Lena...

28:07.381 --> 28:08.904
pitting her against me?

28:08.948 --> 28:12.821
You're a man with alien DNA
coursing through him,

28:12.865 --> 28:15.955
thinking he knows
what's best for this world.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.219
Sound familiar?

28:21.264 --> 28:22.439
Sounds like someone
willing to do

28:22.483 --> 28:24.354
whatever it takes
to save humanity.

29:23.022 --> 29:26.590
<i>♪ I've paid my dues</i>

29:26.634 --> 29:29.289
<i>♪ Time after time</i>

29:30.464 --> 29:33.902
<i>♪ I've done my sentence</i>

29:33.946 --> 29:37.123
<i>♪ But committed no crime</i>

29:38.254 --> 29:40.343
<i>♪ And bad mistakes</i>

29:42.084 --> 29:44.565
<i>♪ I've made a few</i>

29:46.088 --> 29:49.526
<i>♪ I have had my share
of sand kicked in my face ♪</i>

29:49.570 --> 29:52.573
<i>♪ But I've come through</i>

29:56.490 --> 30:00.320
<i>♪ We are the champions
my friends ♪</i>

30:03.889 --> 30:07.588
<i>♪ And we'll
keep on fighting... ♪</i>

30:12.375 --> 30:16.249
Well, if you're here to save
the Girl of Steel,

30:16.292 --> 30:18.468
you're one glam rock hit
too late.

30:21.994 --> 30:23.343
Are we?

30:26.694 --> 30:29.349
-How?
-You're predictable.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.481
You can thank your sister
for proving that.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.832
You still think
you can beat me?

30:33.875 --> 30:35.007
I'm invincible.

30:35.050 --> 30:37.096
Not if we have anything
to say about it.

30:37.139 --> 30:39.315
Welcome to mortality, Lex.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.755
Oh, that's just embarrassing.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.929
I didn't think this day
could get any better.

31:45.294 --> 31:47.427
A Phantom Zone Projector.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.357
No!

32:14.193 --> 32:17.283
Kara! No!

32:25.117 --> 32:26.901
I won.

32:31.297 --> 32:34.256
Careful. I bruise easily.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.911
I'm not immortal anymore,
remember?

32:36.955 --> 32:39.000
Brainy, what's taking so long
with that Projector?

32:39.044 --> 32:40.828
The date has been wiped.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.395
I don't know
if it's recoverable

32:42.438 --> 32:44.049
and the Projector itself...

32:44.092 --> 32:45.964
No, we don't need it.
I'll just open
a transmat portal

32:46.007 --> 32:47.226
like I did during Crisis.

32:47.269 --> 32:48.705
No, no, no.
Even if that were to work

32:48.749 --> 32:50.098
without the coordinates
of where he sent her,

32:50.142 --> 32:52.666
she could be anywhere
in the Phantom Zone.

32:54.494 --> 32:55.625
Guys.

32:55.669 --> 32:57.410
I found recording crystals.

32:57.453 --> 32:59.934
Ah, yes.
When I arrived,

32:59.978 --> 33:01.457
she was in the middle
of a missive.

33:01.501 --> 33:04.025
Sort of a last will
and testament.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.374
Very dry.

33:05.418 --> 33:06.985
You're lucky I cut her off
when I did.

33:08.682 --> 33:11.076
No, no, no, no.
We're not watching those

33:11.119 --> 33:12.512
'cause Kara is not dead.

33:12.555 --> 33:14.470
We are bringing her home.

33:14.514 --> 33:18.387
And you are going to wish
that you were dead

33:18.431 --> 33:20.346
while you are rotting
in that cell.

33:20.389 --> 33:21.956
Hmm. About that...

33:22.000 --> 33:25.090
I'm not going anywhere
near a cell.

33:25.133 --> 33:28.136
Unless you want me to reveal
Supergirl's identity.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.746
She may be gone,
but she still has

33:29.790 --> 33:31.748
an awful lot of enemies
out there.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.663
It would be tragic
if Mama Danvers

33:33.707 --> 33:36.405
or your lovely Kelly Olsen

33:36.449 --> 33:38.277
were to become
the target of one of...

33:41.845 --> 33:43.412
Sorry. Did you want
to do that?

33:43.456 --> 33:45.675
No. Family first.

33:45.719 --> 33:47.503
M'gann and I will take him
to the authorities.

33:47.547 --> 33:49.418
Then I'll go and speak
to my brother Mal.

33:49.462 --> 33:50.854
He spent time
in the Phantom Zone.

33:50.898 --> 33:52.856
He may be able
to help us locate her.

33:55.555 --> 33:56.860
What am I going to do
with Kelly?

33:56.904 --> 34:00.516
How am I supposed to explain
all this?

34:00.560 --> 34:02.649
Kelly doesn't know
that Kara is Supergirl?

34:11.875 --> 34:13.877
<i>Lex Luthor has been arrested</i>

34:13.921 --> 34:16.576
<i>in what sources are calling
a plot against the world.</i>

34:16.619 --> 34:17.620
Can't believe it.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.448
Lex Luther, a bad guy?

34:19.492 --> 34:21.320
Believe it, Mackenzie.

34:21.363 --> 34:23.713
Lucky for us,
our very own William Dey

34:23.757 --> 34:25.889
has the inside scoop.

34:25.933 --> 34:28.544
This firsthand account
Eve Tessmacher gave you...

34:28.588 --> 34:31.634
It's going to earn CatCo
another Pulitzer.

34:31.678 --> 34:32.983
You mean
we're still in business?

34:33.027 --> 34:34.768
After what happened
with Obsidian?

34:34.811 --> 34:37.249
Sadly, Obsidian North
has folded.

34:37.292 --> 34:40.730
But that
is my father's problem.

34:40.774 --> 34:44.517
He bought all my shares
right before the company
crashed this morning.

34:44.560 --> 34:48.173
I realize in retrospect,
I was undervaluing CatCo.

34:48.216 --> 34:51.741
We could be a beacon,
the crown jewel
of investigative journalism.

34:51.785 --> 34:54.004
We certainly have the talent.

34:54.048 --> 34:56.920
And reporting in-depth,
real news,

34:56.964 --> 34:59.140
we can change hearts
and minds.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.533
We'll start our relaunch

35:00.576 --> 35:03.231
with unparalleled
news coverage on Lex Luther,

35:03.275 --> 35:04.580
thanks to William.

35:04.624 --> 35:07.017
Well, it wasn't
just me, Andrea.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.150
That story has
a shared byline.

35:09.194 --> 35:10.630
Kara Danvers...

35:10.673 --> 35:12.675
She's been with me
following every lead on Lex,

35:12.719 --> 35:14.068
since I got to National City.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.070
Oh. Well,
where is Ms. Danvers?

35:16.114 --> 35:17.115
I'd like to thank her.

35:17.158 --> 35:21.031
She's with Cat Grant
on a story.

35:21.075 --> 35:23.033
She said it was supposed to be
the biggest of her life.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.297
Kara left town?

35:25.340 --> 35:27.299
I guess when Cat says "jump,"
you jump.

35:27.342 --> 35:29.779
Well, since Kara
is exclusive to CatCo,

35:29.823 --> 35:31.868
whatever story Cat's
pulled her away to do

35:31.912 --> 35:33.653
will be our front page soon.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.829
Let's hope it's a doozy.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.787
Tick-tock.
Everyone back to work.

35:37.831 --> 35:39.789
We've got a paper to put out.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.054
Nia?

35:44.098 --> 35:47.014
Did you speak
to Kara yourself?

35:47.057 --> 35:49.408
I just can't believe
she left without telling me.

35:49.451 --> 35:51.105
Alex told me.

35:51.149 --> 35:52.411
I'm sure she would
have called you

35:52.454 --> 35:53.803
if she could have, William.

35:58.417 --> 36:01.420
I want it on the record
that I'm resisting the urge

36:01.463 --> 36:02.986
to say "I told you
your obsession

36:03.030 --> 36:04.814
with the Kryptonians
would end like this."

36:04.858 --> 36:06.686
I'm glad you
held your tongue, Mother.

36:08.992 --> 36:10.168
Lena?

36:19.351 --> 36:20.700
Hey.

36:22.919 --> 36:24.704
I think this belongs to you.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.141
Came in handy.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.838
Thanks.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.797
I should have protected Kara.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.018
I failed.

36:36.150 --> 36:37.456
I failed everyone.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.197
You didn't fail, Brainy.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.285
You defeated Leviathan.

36:40.328 --> 36:41.982
Supergirl is gone.

36:42.591 --> 36:45.203
Lex Luther lives.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.248
I should have let the other
Brainiac-5's take on Leviathan

36:47.292 --> 36:49.207
because clearly I was
too stupid to get it right.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.599
Brainy, stop!

36:52.340 --> 36:55.213
You are not stupid.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.215
You were put in
a no-win situation

36:57.258 --> 37:00.043
and you did the best
you could.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.567
I hurt you.

37:02.742 --> 37:06.267
That... was not the best.

37:08.269 --> 37:09.618
You did.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.143
But I still care about you.

37:13.187 --> 37:15.711
How can you
be so kind after...

37:16.712 --> 37:18.236
after everything?

37:18.801 --> 37:20.890
It's not logical.

37:20.934 --> 37:22.762
The heart isn't logical.

37:26.113 --> 37:30.944
When we thought you were dying
on the Leviathan ship,

37:30.987 --> 37:33.381
you said that you loved me.

37:33.425 --> 37:35.688
If that's still true and...

37:36.819 --> 37:40.301
you want to fix us,

37:40.345 --> 37:43.609
you need to start engaging
with me honestly,

37:44.697 --> 37:45.959
no matter what.

37:46.002 --> 37:47.743
Even if you think
you're protecting me.

37:47.787 --> 37:50.093
Because, Brainy,

37:50.137 --> 37:52.922
I am not a woman
who needs to be protected.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.623
Of course.

37:59.146 --> 38:01.975
You're a woman who
stops tidal waves...

38:04.282 --> 38:06.980
and who dreams
impossible things.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.200
And loves you too.

38:14.204 --> 38:15.684
No more secrets?

38:17.512 --> 38:18.948
I promise.

38:30.351 --> 38:31.787
Hey.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.485
Did Malefic have any advice
about getting her back?

38:33.528 --> 38:35.965
Unfortunately not.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.967
He was only able to find
Midnight in the Phantom Zone

38:38.011 --> 38:41.319
because he knew
her exact location.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.016
He did tell me about
someone who once mounted

38:43.059 --> 38:44.670
a rescue mission there,
though.

38:44.713 --> 38:46.715
We need to get to them, now.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.413
M'gann is already looking
for him.

38:48.456 --> 38:50.284
J'onn,

38:50.328 --> 38:52.591
I need my sister.

38:52.634 --> 38:54.984
Hey, the people out there...

38:55.028 --> 38:56.725
Nia covered for her
at CatCo,

38:56.769 --> 38:58.466
but everyone else,
they need to know

38:58.510 --> 39:02.644
that she's still around,
that she's protecting people.

39:02.688 --> 39:05.386
You're not your sister,

39:05.430 --> 39:08.389
but you're every part a hero
as she is.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.826
I've seen that every day
I've spent with you.

39:10.870 --> 39:12.741
And I saw it today,

39:12.785 --> 39:14.395
when you summoned the strength

39:14.439 --> 39:18.399
and belief in yourself
to take down Lex Luther.

39:18.443 --> 39:21.097
In fact, you remind me
of a colleague I once had

39:21.141 --> 39:23.970
on Mars called N'orr Cott.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.842
We were a team.

39:26.886 --> 39:28.104
Every time I put
criminals away,

39:28.148 --> 39:29.497
she would always stand guard

39:29.541 --> 39:32.413
in case of a surprise escape
or an ambush.

39:32.457 --> 39:36.374
She had patience, courage
and commitment,

39:36.417 --> 39:38.071
just like you.

39:38.941 --> 39:41.204
We called her Sentinel.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.252
I want to show you something.

39:50.431 --> 39:53.216
This was her symbol,

39:53.260 --> 39:57.264
and now I think
it should be yours.

39:59.179 --> 40:00.398
Sentinel.

40:02.443 --> 40:03.792
I like that.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.933
We will get her back.

40:13.976 --> 40:15.717
Until then,

40:15.761 --> 40:19.417
together we will keep
this city safe.

40:26.989 --> 40:28.948
Sorry. I didn't mean
to interrupt.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.212
It's okay.

40:32.255 --> 40:34.693
I came to return Myriad
for you to safeguard it

40:34.736 --> 40:37.086
till Kara gets back.

40:37.130 --> 40:38.740
I have to admit though,
I did use it

40:38.784 --> 40:40.220
one last time tonight.

40:42.352 --> 40:46.269
On Lex and my mother
and everyone associated
with them.

40:46.313 --> 40:48.794
I wiped their minds
of Supergirl's identity.

40:49.621 --> 40:51.274
To protect you all.

40:53.755 --> 40:58.934
I understand now
why keeping Kara secret
was meant to keep me safe.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.242
But, Alex,

41:03.330 --> 41:05.114
you really need
to tell Kelly.

41:05.158 --> 41:06.899
She's your person.

41:06.942 --> 41:09.205
And you're going to need
someone to talk to
through all of this.

41:09.249 --> 41:12.861
If you don't, you'll just
end up walling yourself off.

41:13.906 --> 41:16.082
Trust me, that won't do you
any good.

41:17.910 --> 41:19.868
Lena's right.

41:19.912 --> 41:21.827
Kara would want you
to tell her.

41:25.004 --> 41:27.136
We will get her back.
