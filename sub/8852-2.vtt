Oh... good morning.

01:05.120 --> 01:06.222
Oh...

01:06.289 --> 01:09.692
Oh, my brain is.

01:09.759 --> 01:11.126
Look at this dude.

01:11.194 --> 01:15.264
Oh, Blake, how long have
you been up, man?

01:15.332 --> 01:19.468
- Blake!
- Blake!

01:19.536 --> 01:22.438
I'm up. I'm up.

01:22.505 --> 01:26.141
I'm up.

01:26.209 --> 01:27.170

Ugh...

01:40.690 --> 01:43.353
Our house smells like sweaty taint.

01:43.519 --> 01:44.855
It smells exactly like sweaty taint.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.982
That might be
your upper lip, man.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.317
Good one. Burn!
You're burnin' me.

01:49.483 --> 01:52.301
- Uh-uh.
- Seriously. Like, do you not remember

01:52.369 --> 01:54.236
smearing the poo moustache

01:54.304 --> 01:55.657
and calling yourself Adolf Shitler?

01:55.823 --> 01:57.075
I remember that.
That was...

01:57.241 --> 01:59.909
That was weirdly early
in the night, actually.

01:59.976 --> 02:01.204
That was...That was fun.

02:01.370 --> 02:03.379
I mean, what time
did everything even end?

02:03.446 --> 02:05.459
Who said it ended?

02:07.250 --> 02:08.544
Hey, what's up, fellas?

02:08.711 --> 02:12.321
Now, I know your bellies ready
for some of this eggs Tyrone.

02:12.389 --> 02:15.157
It's off the chain, baby!

02:15.225 --> 02:17.893
You ready to fill them stomachs up

02:17.961 --> 02:21.016
with some hot cheese and eggs?

02:21.182 --> 02:22.142
What up?

02:22.308 --> 02:23.565
Oh, man,
this is cold-blooded.

02:23.633 --> 02:24.767
Y'all changed overnight.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.188
That's what we do.
We change. Okay.

02:26.354 --> 02:30.205
Oh, hello.
Don't slam it, dude.

02:30.273 --> 02:31.985
I'm never drinking again.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.737
We said the same thing
last week.

02:33.903 --> 02:37.115
- I wanna die.
- No, you don't.

02:37.281 --> 02:38.533
That's just the hangover talking.

02:38.699 --> 02:40.827
We should just drink more.
It'll make us feel better.

02:40.993 --> 02:44.164
No, I'm not 16.
I can't drink like that anymore.

02:44.330 --> 02:46.208
Oh, come on,
<i>Blakeypoo.</i>

02:46.374 --> 02:48.123
Have a beer for mama.
Have a...

02:48.191 --> 02:50.086
No, get that away.
I'll puke if I smell it.

02:50.252 --> 02:52.297
Guys, I have a headache,
so quiet.

02:52.463 --> 02:56.468
Whoa-ho-ho!
Blon-ders in the building!

02:56.634 --> 02:58.200
Oh...

02:58.268 --> 02:59.137
What-ders?

02:59.303 --> 03:02.599
Take a peeksey.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.307
Oh, my--aah!

03:05.375 --> 03:06.645
Oh, my God, is that real?

03:06.811 --> 03:08.043
- Did you do this to me?
- No.

03:08.111 --> 03:09.945
Oh, now I remember.
Remember last night,

03:10.013 --> 03:12.651
he kept talking about
Jared leto from <i>fight club?</i>

03:12.817 --> 03:14.277
Oh, yeah!

03:14.443 --> 03:15.654
And here we are.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.720
My God, I was. Okay...
All right, all right, that's it.

03:17.787 --> 03:20.489
That's it. I put my career
in jeopardy for the last time.

03:20.557 --> 03:22.077
We've got to stop drinking.

03:22.243 --> 03:23.726
- What?
- Yeah.

03:23.793 --> 03:25.163
You know what, you're right.

03:25.329 --> 03:27.165
Let's do it.
Let's...Let's do it.

03:27.331 --> 03:30.126
Let's make sure we don't have
one of those weird problems.

03:30.292 --> 03:32.045
- Yeah.
- Quit drinking?

03:32.211 --> 03:36.842
Wha...I...I...I don't...
I can't even...I'm...

03:37.008 --> 03:38.774
I'm sorry. If you
probably couldn't handle it,

03:38.842 --> 03:40.220
then we'll do it... that's fine.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.611
No, I could han...
I can quit.

03:42.679 --> 03:44.266
I'm not drinking right now.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.977
Fully in control
of my addiction, so...

03:47.143 --> 03:50.146
Cool. How long are we
thinking? Maybe, like...

03:50.312 --> 03:51.481
- A month?
- Like two days.

03:51.647 --> 03:52.983
Two days?

03:53.149 --> 03:55.986
If I wasn't so drunk
right now, I'd smack you.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.697
- A week.
- A week.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.996
Totally sober for a week.
What do you guys say?

04:01.064 --> 04:02.664
This is me saying yes.

04:02.732 --> 04:04.160
- All right. Deal?
- Deal.

04:04.326 --> 04:05.912
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:06.078 --> 04:08.137
Let's do it, then.
Let's make a pinky promise,

04:08.204 --> 04:09.165
make this official.

04:09.331 --> 04:11.334
- All right.
- Do we have to?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.075
Come on now,
get in here, you two.

04:13.143 --> 04:14.212
Get up in the mix.

04:14.378 --> 04:15.611
I actually like it.

04:15.678 --> 04:19.259
Mmmmmmwah!

04:19.425 --> 04:20.682
I don't think this is
gonna be that hard. Right?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.951
We just do what we do...
Whenever we do what we do,

04:23.019 --> 04:24.180
but without drinking.

04:24.346 --> 04:26.558
♪ She's my cherry pie ♪

04:26.724 --> 04:29.728
Think about it,
that's someone's child.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.938
A father's daughter.

04:32.104 --> 04:33.595
Judging from
the c-section scar

04:33.663 --> 04:34.900
I'd say she's a mother herself.

04:35.066 --> 04:36.985
Sweetie, have you had lunch today?

04:37.151 --> 04:40.402
$9 for a ginger ale?

04:45.659 --> 04:48.043
Haven't they heard
of night construction?

04:48.111 --> 04:51.833
Like, they're being
so rude out there.

04:51.999 --> 04:53.549
No, sir, I'm not
a country music fan either.

04:53.616 --> 04:56.296
Just personally...

04:56.462 --> 04:58.006
This is reba,
and these are her hits.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.789
Hello?

05:00.857 --> 05:02.624
Can you stop?
I just lost a sale.

05:02.692 --> 05:03.553
What are you even doing?

05:03.719 --> 05:04.860
I'm making an app

05:04.928 --> 05:07.098
that translates farts into English.

05:07.264 --> 05:09.498
That's great.
So what's your business model?

05:09.566 --> 05:10.899
Are you gonna program it?

05:10.967 --> 05:12.646
Do you even have a target demo
that you're thinking of?

05:12.812 --> 05:15.771
Well, I don't think
that <i>fartsi</i> needs one of those

05:15.839 --> 05:19.775
once the blog buzzes gets to it.

05:21.177 --> 05:23.323
Canoe, or small boat.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.680
I'm friends with
a nine-year-old boy.

05:24.747 --> 05:25.825
This is great.

05:25.991 --> 05:27.850
And I'm, like, great friends,
apparently,

05:27.917 --> 05:30.830
with Ric flair,
so that's cool too--whoo!

05:30.996 --> 05:32.855
Guys, I know that
we're all struggling

05:32.922 --> 05:34.056
with our sobriety right now.

05:34.124 --> 05:35.543
I really feel we should
go cold Turkey.

05:35.709 --> 05:38.380
I don't think that's what
they mean by that.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.062
- No.
- No, what do you mean?

05:40.130 --> 05:41.830
That's exactly what it means.
Dr. drew said

05:41.898 --> 05:44.133
the best way to quit drinking
is by going cold Turkey.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.764
And he's a doctor, so why
would you question...Doctors?

05:47.930 --> 05:50.183
- So true.
- What's up with your headset?

05:50.349 --> 05:54.476
What's up, uh,
with your old face, Anders?

05:54.544 --> 05:56.311
- No...
- Or should I say <i>Blonders?</i>

05:56.379 --> 05:58.046
That's funny. Why don't you
go back in your area?

05:58.114 --> 05:59.848
I just saw you lick
your microphone.

05:59.916 --> 06:00.983
- No, you didn't.
- What is that?

06:01.050 --> 06:02.417
- This is my office space!
- Is that--

06:02.485 --> 06:04.620
- you're intruding
my office space right now.

06:04.687 --> 06:06.032
- Oh, my God, that's booze!
- Get out of here!

06:06.198 --> 06:07.723
- No, that's booze.
- Stop it!

06:07.790 --> 06:09.391
Oh, looky here.

06:09.459 --> 06:12.706
Mr. cold Turkey put a mini
booze bottle in his headset?

06:12.872 --> 06:15.041
I really like your ingenuity,

06:15.207 --> 06:17.752
- but... destroy "ze" prototype.
- Gladly.

06:17.918 --> 06:19.468
No, that's my...
You know how many minutes

06:19.536 --> 06:20.802
of tinkering that took me?

06:20.870 --> 06:22.632
It took me, like,
seven minutes to make.

06:22.798 --> 06:24.039
We took an oath, all right?

06:24.107 --> 06:25.510
Yeah.
You're not special.

06:25.676 --> 06:26.942
I am special.
That's why I took

06:27.010 --> 06:28.471
all those "special" classes
in high school.

06:28.637 --> 06:30.557
Why do you think you can
boss me around, huh...

06:30.723 --> 06:32.434
Slim shady?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.983
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- I'm a big boy, slim shady.

06:35.051 --> 06:36.151
- I'm not slim shady.
- That's a trigger word.

06:36.219 --> 06:37.486
That's a trigger.

06:37.554 --> 06:38.481
I'm Marshall mathers
or something even cooler.

06:38.647 --> 06:40.222
You know what,
I don't give a shoot.

06:40.290 --> 06:42.925
I'm gonna go back to work,
eat my cold Turkey,

06:42.992 --> 06:48.408
and beat this addiction
like the <i>boss</i> that I am.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.567
Psych!
Oh...What?

06:51.634 --> 06:52.620
There's a boss move!

06:52.786 --> 06:54.236
- That's it!
- Hey, hey!

06:54.304 --> 06:55.498
- I'm the boss!
- Okay, look...

06:55.664 --> 06:58.006
All right, I now this is
really tough for us...

06:58.074 --> 06:59.708
Like, bizarrely tough for us...

06:59.776 --> 07:01.910
But I now something
that can cool us out.

07:01.978 --> 07:04.846
Check it out, I got some
dank William juniors.

07:04.914 --> 07:07.761
Got it from Karl. Two nugs
for my two best buds. Let's...

07:07.927 --> 07:08.887
Sober means sober, okay?

07:09.053 --> 07:11.514
No weed, no booze, no nothing.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.099
If I can't drink,
you can't smoke weed.

07:13.265 --> 07:14.523
- Right.
- What?

07:14.591 --> 07:15.791
Unless we want to smoke weed.

07:15.858 --> 07:17.312
We should smoke weed, I feel.

07:17.478 --> 07:18.605
- No!
- Let's smoke some weed.

07:18.771 --> 07:22.030
I'm so sorry,
but we're <i>not doing this!</i>

07:22.098 --> 07:23.565
We took an oath!
Just go back to work.

07:23.633 --> 07:24.733
You destroy something of mine,

07:24.801 --> 07:26.702
I destroy something of yours.

07:26.769 --> 07:29.471
Oh-ho! Guess what,
I also destroy your stuff.

07:29.539 --> 07:31.640
- Yep. That's right.
- I'm gonna destroy...

07:31.708 --> 07:33.342
- Oh, that's my stuff.
- I'm gonna take this,

07:33.409 --> 07:34.543
and I'm gonna just...

07:34.611 --> 07:38.917
Get rid of your stuff,
you stupid dummy!

07:42.852 --> 07:44.047
Hi.

07:45.965 --> 07:48.802
Before you can say anything,
you should know

07:48.968 --> 07:51.093
that we're ithe process
of going sober right now,

07:51.160 --> 07:53.014
so that's why we're, ahhhh...

07:53.180 --> 07:56.164
I didn't realize that.

07:56.232 --> 07:57.811
How long has it been
since your last drink?

07:57.977 --> 08:01.689
Um, it's going on,
like, 20 hours.

08:01.855 --> 08:02.982
- Nice job.
- Well, I can, um...

08:03.148 --> 08:05.741
I can understand
what you guys are going through.

08:05.808 --> 08:09.280
I'm actually two years sober myself.

08:09.446 --> 08:12.180
Whoa! Uhh! Wow...

08:12.248 --> 08:14.285
Wow, sounds like
you had a real problem.

08:14.451 --> 08:15.851
We're not trying
to go <i>sober</i> sober.

08:15.918 --> 08:16.996
We're just trying to...

08:17.162 --> 08:18.820
We're just kinda
pumping the brakes.

08:18.888 --> 08:20.255
You know, doing
the Hollywood cleanse.

08:20.323 --> 08:21.501
Yeah.
Yeah, we are.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.924
We drank, like,
a weird amount, but, like,

08:22.992 --> 08:25.004
- it'd be weirder to stop.
- Yeah, that would be weird.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.923
Straight-edge people
are weird.

08:27.089 --> 08:29.664
Okay, here's the deal.
You're gonna clock out,

08:29.732 --> 08:31.633
and you're gonna go see Eric in h.R.

08:31.701 --> 08:33.602
Then you're gonna take
a substance-abuse course

08:33.669 --> 08:35.181
before you can start working again.

08:35.347 --> 08:36.638
I don't know
if we necessarily need

08:36.706 --> 08:37.808
to take a substance-abuse course...

08:37.975 --> 08:39.269
Or I can fire you.

08:39.434 --> 08:41.176
Wow, we just dodged a bullet.

08:41.244 --> 08:44.413
She definitely could have axed
the brothers mcmuffins.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.281
- That's us.
- Oh, cool.

08:46.349 --> 08:48.049
We don't have
a substance-abuse problem.

08:48.117 --> 08:50.018
If anything, we have
a <i>subway</i> abuse problem...

08:50.086 --> 08:52.282
- We <i>destroy</i> $5 foot-longs.
- Yeah, we do.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.055
I don't know man,
maybe we do have

08:54.123 --> 08:55.201
a substance-abuse problem.

08:55.367 --> 08:57.092
Yeah, well, I don't know.
Maybe we do.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.593
Maybe we don't.
I don't know.

08:58.661 --> 09:01.496
You know? I'm not the king
of substance abuse.

09:01.564 --> 09:03.765
All I do know is I gotta
go pinch out a growler,

09:03.833 --> 09:05.211
and it's a furious beast.

09:05.377 --> 09:06.868
- So I'm gonna go do that...
- Okay.

09:06.936 --> 09:08.506
And I'll see you guys
at the head shrinker's office.

09:08.672 --> 09:10.925
Dude, hurry up.
We're supposed to be there now.

09:11.091 --> 09:13.074
Yeah, I'm gonna go
hurry up my bowel movement

09:13.142 --> 09:15.043
so I'm not two minutes late
for some fake-ass class.

09:15.111 --> 09:17.179
Yeah!

09:17.246 --> 09:20.449
Yeah, Blonders, that's a good idea.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.937
That's a good... that's a good idea.

09:23.103 --> 09:24.419
♪ ♪

09:24.487 --> 09:25.821
- ♪ you gotta ♪
- ♪ You gotta be fresh ♪

09:26.648 --> 09:28.182
♪ it's insane ♪

09:34.389 --> 09:35.366
Dude, Adam better hurry up.

09:35.532 --> 09:37.911
It's like the guy never
listens to me.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.127
Chapstick.

09:40.195 --> 09:42.296
Okay, I'm going to
sock you in the mouth

09:42.363 --> 09:44.031
if you don't cut it out
with that crap!

09:44.099 --> 09:46.767
- It's not crap, it's farts.
- Whoa! T.M.I.

09:46.835 --> 09:49.002
That stands for too much information.

09:49.070 --> 09:50.904
- Oh, we weren't even...That's...
- Oh, I don't care.

09:50.972 --> 09:52.573
Come on, have a seat.
Not this one.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.219
Okay.

09:54.385 --> 09:57.745
Little b.G. On me...
I do h.R.

09:57.812 --> 10:00.433
Means human resources here at t.A.C.

10:00.599 --> 10:04.651
My name is Eric rossdale.
Some people call me "cool Eric."

10:04.719 --> 10:06.386
They called me that once.
Some young people too.

10:06.454 --> 10:08.483
Some young...Some...
One young person did that.

10:08.649 --> 10:11.444
I love people.
To say that another way,

10:11.610 --> 10:13.994
I <i>love</i> people!

10:14.062 --> 10:15.865
That one's got a little more
fun to it, doesn't it?

10:16.031 --> 10:18.576
Okay, we are here today...

10:18.742 --> 10:20.968
- Uh...
- Why are you pointing at us?

10:21.035 --> 10:22.703
Help out
with substance abuse...

10:22.771 --> 10:23.937
Well, I'm just trying to
bring everybody into it.

10:24.005 --> 10:25.750
Help out with substance abuse.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.543
Okay? And how do I do that?

10:27.709 --> 10:28.976
Well, one way is
to work through this workbook,

10:29.043 --> 10:30.129
start to finish.

10:30.295 --> 10:32.548
We do every single drill
in this thing.

10:32.714 --> 10:35.115
I sign a piece of paper saying
you've cleaned up your act,

10:35.183 --> 10:37.084
but more importantly, we have dug out

10:37.152 --> 10:38.952
the roots of your addiction.

10:39.020 --> 10:41.121
And you're looking at me
like "what happened to that guy

10:41.189 --> 10:42.923
we called cool two seconds ago?"

10:42.991 --> 10:45.159
He's right here.
How 'bout this instead?

10:45.226 --> 10:48.523
How 'bout we fire up some
<i>step brothers</i> on the blu-ray,

10:48.689 --> 10:50.831
we chill out a little bit...
How does that sound to you?

10:50.899 --> 10:53.236
- Yeah, that sounds...Awesome.
- Yeah.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.735
Okay, great.

10:54.803 --> 10:57.371
Before we start, let me do
some attendance, if that's okay.

10:57.438 --> 10:58.783
Uh, <i>black</i> Anderson.

10:58.949 --> 11:01.119
Uh, I...I think that's me.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.277
Oh, terrific. Oh,
'cause of the curly hair,

11:03.344 --> 11:05.164
like a black man.
That's fun.

11:05.330 --> 11:06.416
Anders holmvik.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.793
- Yeah, right here.
- Yeah, Norwegian.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.086
- Yeah.
- Yeah. <i>Hvordan gar det?</i>

11:10.252 --> 11:12.005
Oh, is that...
No, I don't speak...

11:12.171 --> 11:14.465
- <i>Hvordan gar det?</i>
- Much of the language.

11:14.631 --> 11:16.426
Oh. Oh, you should.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.011
Oh, no, it's a beautiful country.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.512
And Adam demamp.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.764
Actually, Adam's running
a little...

11:21.930 --> 11:23.141
Uh, I am Adam.

11:28.102 --> 11:30.337
Well, I hope you like
sandwiches, Adam,

11:30.405 --> 11:32.108
'cause I got a backpack full of 'em.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.652
Thought they're kinda hot
'cause they were in my backpack.

11:34.818 --> 11:38.406
This is a tuna.
That's made out of tuna.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.908
This is a slightly hotter tuna.

11:41.074 --> 11:42.282
What is that?
Oh.

11:42.350 --> 11:45.538
And I've got a hot,
hot tuna coming through.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.708
Okay...
And I'll turn off the lights.

11:48.874 --> 11:50.376
Dude, where's Adam?

11:50.542 --> 11:51.992
I don't know,
but he's gonna be pissed.

11:52.060 --> 11:53.004
He loves this movie.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.759
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.800
Oh...Oh!

11:59.868 --> 12:01.554
Oh...

12:01.720 --> 12:05.975
Goooooal...

12:11.605 --> 12:13.024
Adam gets it.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.276
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

12:16.902 --> 12:18.488
Thank you, thank you.

12:18.654 --> 12:19.853
You guys deserve some of the credit.

12:19.921 --> 12:22.158
I deserve a little bit more,
but thank you very much.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.285
Hey, nice shot, buddy.
Have a beer.

12:24.451 --> 12:25.626
Hello. No. I'm good.

12:25.693 --> 12:28.328
I'm in a sober pact with my buddies.

12:28.396 --> 12:30.430
It's pretty dumb.
I hate it, but I can't.

12:30.498 --> 12:32.299
However you say no in Spanish,

12:32.367 --> 12:35.630
that is what I'm saying
to you, my Mexican friend.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.504
What, you one of them
straight-edge weirdoes?

12:37.572 --> 12:40.073
No.

12:40.141 --> 12:42.136
Maybe just a little sip, right?

12:44.388 --> 12:45.348
Go!

12:45.514 --> 12:46.847
Well, we all have...
Whoa. Everything...

12:46.915 --> 12:48.248
What's happening?
Should I pause it?

12:48.316 --> 12:50.812
Ooh, must have been the bad tuna.

12:50.978 --> 12:52.397
I am Adam.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.788
You hold it right there, bud.

12:54.856 --> 12:57.193
Well, well, look who's
too good for his friends.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.820
Buddy, if you want to
ditch on the class,

12:58.986 --> 13:01.194
I get that...
But we took an oath!

13:01.262 --> 13:03.030
Yeah, we did our
secret pinky promise.

13:03.097 --> 13:05.076
You had your finger in my mouth.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.967
No, I know that.
Slow your mouth down, okay?

13:07.035 --> 13:07.995
I didn't break any oath.

13:08.161 --> 13:09.670
So don't even go there, okay?

13:09.737 --> 13:10.871
No, you're the one
who's going there.

13:10.939 --> 13:12.083
We're here, you're there.

13:12.249 --> 13:14.174
No, I'm here, you're there.

13:14.242 --> 13:15.442
You've been up there the whole time.

13:15.510 --> 13:16.743
You don't know
what's going on out here.

13:16.811 --> 13:17.911
- I didn't drink anything.
- Well, we're here now!

13:17.979 --> 13:19.246
- Oh, you didn't drink anything?
- No!

13:19.314 --> 13:20.647
He handed...He passed me
the beer, I didn't drink...

13:20.715 --> 13:22.677
What about that little thing
you had on your head, huh?

13:22.843 --> 13:24.484
I feel like I'm at the doors
of the labyrinth,

13:24.552 --> 13:26.180
and everything he's saying is a lie.

13:26.346 --> 13:27.487
- Yeah.
- Is that how we're gonna do?

13:27.555 --> 13:29.267
Guess what, I'm gonna do this
right now.

13:29.433 --> 13:30.724
No, you put it down.
Adam, gimme that beer.

13:30.792 --> 13:31.959
I'm just gonna shoot him
with this nail gun.

13:32.026 --> 13:34.188
- Is there a safety on this?
- Hey, put it down.

13:36.030 --> 13:38.398
Oh, and it's gonna be
so good too.

13:38.466 --> 13:40.069
This is such a dumb plan!

13:40.235 --> 13:41.612
Get down right now!

13:41.778 --> 13:43.364
- Hey, you put that beer down.
- I'm drinking it now.

13:43.530 --> 13:44.699
- Drop the beer, man!
- Don't--

13:44.865 --> 13:46.951
- we're doing this
for you, you moron!

13:47.117 --> 13:48.953
I'm doing this for your...

13:49.119 --> 13:50.621
Oh, we got it.
I'm trying to help you.

13:50.787 --> 13:53.580
You see, Adam,
the thing about this stuff is...

13:53.648 --> 13:55.282
It's poison.
It really is.

13:55.350 --> 13:56.586
No. What are you doing?

13:56.752 --> 13:58.218
God, don't you guys
have any restraint?

13:58.286 --> 14:00.320
You should see yourselves.
It's pathetic.

14:00.388 --> 14:03.551
Okay? We're done with this beer.
Let's go back to work.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.014
Drop that.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.265
Ugh!

14:12.517 --> 14:14.234
Oh, great.

14:14.302 --> 14:16.439
You guys want it, you got it.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.858
Oh, my God!
Ooh--oh...

14:19.024 --> 14:20.776
Funky butt-lovin'!

14:20.942 --> 14:22.375
Did he just say
funky butt-lovin'?

14:22.443 --> 14:23.738
Yeah.

14:29.242 --> 14:30.225
I've gotta be honest
with you, guys.

14:30.293 --> 14:31.893
I'm a little confused
right now, okay.

14:31.961 --> 14:33.289
'Cause one minute we're having fun,

14:33.455 --> 14:35.497
and the next minute
I got a <i>cerveza</i> in the face.

14:35.565 --> 14:36.918
Do you not like <i>step brothers?</i>

14:37.084 --> 14:38.836
- No, it's great. Funny movie.
- It's awesome.

14:39.002 --> 14:40.880
You guys and Diego
got to watch <i>step brothers?</i>

14:41.046 --> 14:42.137
Yeah. But guess what,
it's off.

14:42.205 --> 14:44.105
And you can forget about
the deleted scenes too

14:44.173 --> 14:45.468
because we're going back
to the workbook.

14:45.634 --> 14:47.637
- Oh...
- Come on, don't be bogus.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.177
And you don't
clock back into work

14:49.245 --> 14:50.745
until you've gone through
every exercise.

14:50.813 --> 14:51.847
And that means
you're not gonna get paid

14:51.914 --> 14:52.892
until you do this right.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.450
Okay, so exercise one.

14:55.518 --> 14:57.146
Oh, art therapy.
This'll be fun.

15:00.489 --> 15:03.444
All right, I want you to draw
a picture of your addiction.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.321
Okay, so what does addiction
look like to you?

15:05.487 --> 15:07.462
Addiction.
Get it?

15:07.530 --> 15:09.825
A <i>dick shin.</i>

15:09.991 --> 15:13.768
Next-level <i>far side</i> stuff, dude.

15:13.836 --> 15:15.373
Keep it up, funny guys.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.208
But I'm not going anywhere!

15:18.774 --> 15:20.542
Next exercise is to
write a letter to yourself

15:20.610 --> 15:22.296
five years from today.

15:22.462 --> 15:25.046
And once all 25
of the demamp spawn

15:25.114 --> 15:27.182
have grown up and graduated
from sculpture school...

15:27.250 --> 15:28.553
- Not a real thing.
- It is.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.419
We'll pick the best one
to make a statue of our body,

15:31.487 --> 15:32.554
and then nike will probably buy it...

15:32.622 --> 15:33.855
Probably not.

15:33.923 --> 15:35.857
And make all their mannequins
exact replicas of it,

15:35.925 --> 15:37.478
because our body is
the perfect human form...

15:37.644 --> 15:39.060
You're fat.

15:39.128 --> 15:41.463
Yeah, you guys are as funny as
the step brothers, aren't you?

15:41.530 --> 15:42.733
Except guess what.

15:42.899 --> 15:45.278
The step brothers don't have
a drinking problem.

15:45.444 --> 15:49.537
Okay, so next exercise, number 11,

15:49.605 --> 15:51.617
finish my sentences.
This one is pretty...

15:51.783 --> 15:53.452
- Self-explanatory.
- Yes, but I haven't actually...

15:53.618 --> 15:55.538
You haven't actually
had sex with an animal? Okay.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.946
- Yeah, but we gotta stick...
- Our butt cheeks together

15:58.014 --> 16:00.048
- and clap our hands?
- All right, you know what,

16:00.116 --> 16:01.294
- I don't want to--
- Do this exercise?

16:01.460 --> 16:02.450
Yeah, neither do I.
Let's not do it.

16:02.518 --> 16:04.797
Okay. You're welcome.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.299
And the last one is
sock puppets.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.989
I know... I know it sounds ridiculous,

16:08.057 --> 16:09.760
but you're not getting paid
until you do it.

16:09.926 --> 16:11.192
Plus, it says it's a lot of fun.

16:11.260 --> 16:13.395
On the other hand, it is
a sock puppet saying that.

16:13.462 --> 16:15.308
I don't know if you can
really take his word for it.

16:18.401 --> 16:21.736
♪ ♪

16:21.804 --> 16:24.940
Okay, those are...
Great, actually.

16:25.007 --> 16:28.543
- So let's use 'em.
- This is so dumb.

16:28.611 --> 16:29.989
I'm not gonna do this.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.283
Dude, it's notbout you.
Okay? Sock up.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.367
Use the puppet.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.787
Fine. This is <i>dumb.</i>

16:36.953 --> 16:39.206
Almost as dumb as not drinking
for an entire week.

16:39.372 --> 16:42.126
Everything
you don't want to do is dumb.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.629
And <i>fartsi's</i>
a <i>genius</i> idea!

16:44.795 --> 16:47.506
Yeah.
For once, Adam's right, Blake.

16:47.672 --> 16:49.531
It's time you grew up
and put your time towards

16:49.598 --> 16:51.866
something that's worth something
to somebody

16:51.934 --> 16:52.887
anywhere on this planet.

16:53.053 --> 16:54.055
Get him!

16:57.339 --> 16:59.107
Don't tell me what to do.

16:59.175 --> 17:03.147
You're not the boss of me,
you fake-ass grown-up.

17:03.313 --> 17:04.579
Ooh...

17:04.646 --> 17:06.580
Oh, I'm sorry, maybe
if you weren't so immature,

17:06.648 --> 17:09.028
I wouldn't have to hold your
hand and wipe your ass for you.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.071
Okay, that was one time.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.824
And I told you, I'd never been
camping before.

17:13.990 --> 17:16.993
Hey, guys, why don't we
talk about me now?

17:17.160 --> 17:18.926
Oh, of course.
Who could forget you?

17:18.993 --> 17:20.595
I love how it takes us
to quit drinking

17:20.663 --> 17:23.498
to remember how selfish Adam
"the main attraction" demamp

17:23.566 --> 17:24.752
really is.

17:24.917 --> 17:27.602
Oh, I like how you're using
that nickname

17:27.670 --> 17:29.840
to hurt my feelings,
but guess what, Anders.

17:30.006 --> 17:31.172
- Yeah?
- I love it.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.636
And I'm gonna use it
all the time now.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.930
Do you ever stop talking?

17:36.096 --> 17:38.432
Yeah, Blake, I'll agree.
But at least he knows

17:38.598 --> 17:41.060
how to write a rent check
on time, like an adult.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.729
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh. You want me to grow up?

17:43.895 --> 17:46.315
Yeah, I'm immature.
I'm <i>real</i> immature.

17:46.481 --> 17:51.292
But I'm immature
because I know, when I grow up,

17:51.360 --> 17:53.294
it means I'm gonna be
that much closer

17:53.362 --> 17:54.796
to moving away from you guys,

17:54.864 --> 17:56.909
and marrying girls and stuff.

17:57.075 --> 17:59.954
Come on, man, don't say that.

18:00.120 --> 18:04.539
No...He's right.

18:04.607 --> 18:07.142
I'm sorry too.

18:07.209 --> 18:09.644
I know I can be
self-centered sometimes,

18:09.712 --> 18:13.259
but...
I never heard "no" growing up.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.784
Now that I've logged
10,000 hours of being a brat,

18:16.852 --> 18:19.220
I'm just a total
self-serving outlier,

18:19.288 --> 18:22.223
and that's not how Adam
"the main attraction" demamp

18:22.291 --> 18:23.436
wants to live!

18:23.602 --> 18:25.527
Oh, man. Adam, look...

18:25.594 --> 18:27.231
It's hard to say no to that face.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.649
- It's a cute one.
- It is.

18:28.815 --> 18:29.942
Thank you.

18:30.108 --> 18:32.066
I know I can be
controlling sometimes,

18:32.134 --> 18:34.655
but it's just because
I care about you,

18:34.821 --> 18:36.907
and I want the best r you.

18:37.073 --> 18:38.940
But sometimes I don't know
what's best.

18:39.008 --> 18:41.537
And that... that scares me.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.915
Life...Is...Scary.

18:45.081 --> 18:47.148
I know that I can
tell you guys this,

18:47.216 --> 18:50.451
and you won't judge me.

18:50.519 --> 18:55.301
I...Like...You guys!

18:55.467 --> 18:56.791
I like you too, man!

18:56.859 --> 18:59.263
I like you.
Let's stop fighting.

18:59.429 --> 19:01.682
Let's stop fighting.
I like you guys!

19:01.848 --> 19:04.199
I like you guys!

19:04.266 --> 19:06.812
Wow.
That was intense.

19:06.978 --> 19:09.037
This book works.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.839
I mean, you guys made
actual progress today.

19:11.907 --> 19:13.374
And it was because of...

19:13.442 --> 19:15.029
- Us.
- Me!

19:15.195 --> 19:17.907
I gotta... congratulations. You pass.

19:18.073 --> 19:19.325
- Really?
- Cool. Thank you so much.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.451
Thanks, cool Eric.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.016
Yeah, just leave your puppets
at the door,

19:22.084 --> 19:23.204
and here's your release form.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.587
- You are cool.
- Thanks. Um, actually,

19:25.654 --> 19:27.082
is it cool if I keep mine?

19:27.248 --> 19:28.250
- Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.

19:28.416 --> 19:30.252
I keep all puppets.

20:46.119 --> 20:49.852
That was, uh...Weird.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.988
Yeah.

20:52.055 --> 20:54.023
Being sober makes you
really see things

20:54.091 --> 20:55.170
the way they really are.

20:55.336 --> 20:58.924
So...What now?

21:02.427 --> 21:03.929
Drinks for my buddies!

21:04.095 --> 21:05.598
- All right.
- Send 'em down.

21:05.764 --> 21:07.308
Sendin' 'em down.

21:09.106 --> 21:10.895
That means thank you!

21:11.061 --> 21:13.355
I'm making an app
that translates farts.

21:13.521 --> 21:15.912
Oh, baby, that sounds amazing.

21:15.979 --> 21:17.780
Now give big mama some money.

21:17.848 --> 21:19.515
All right, now,
you gotta do it right, okay?

21:19.583 --> 21:24.241
Let's graze the skin,
then put it under the strap.

21:24.407 --> 21:25.367
See the goose bumps?

21:25.533 --> 21:27.369
Oh, she's feeling you, dude.

21:27.535 --> 21:29.258
I don't even mind
the pregnancy scars.

21:29.326 --> 21:31.127
- Hell, I <i>like</i> 'em.
- Those are cool!

21:31.194 --> 21:33.996
- These chicks get it!
- Yeah!

21:34.064 --> 21:37.171
Let's hear it for eunice.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.201
And coming to the stage now,

21:39.269 --> 21:41.008
the seductive Karen.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.968
Get at it, boys.

21:43.134 --> 21:44.573
- That guy is awesome!
- Yeah.

21:44.641 --> 21:47.681
- Take my money.
- What's he doing?

21:47.847 --> 21:51.514
Oh, dude!
Aaaaa...You are awesome!

21:51.581 --> 21:53.082
You should come to our house
and party,

21:53.150 --> 21:55.147
and bring eunice
and all these awesome chicks.

21:57.087 --> 21:58.984
Heil, shitler!

21:59.150 --> 22:00.527
Cool, cool.
Definitely.

22:00.693 --> 22:03.530
Shitler party,
shitler party, yeah.

22:03.696 --> 22:06.700
Wow, I don't know
what that means!
