(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:02.670 --> 00:04.205
sexually based offenses

00:04.238 --> 00:06.540
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.576
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.609 --> 00:10.511
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.544 --> 00:12.080
are members of an elite squad

00:12.113 --> 00:13.781
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.417
These are their stories.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.619
Aah!

00:18.652 --> 00:20.588
Please, oh, God.
Please, please.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.123
No. No.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.657
[crying]
No.

00:23.691 --> 00:24.592
Nooo!

00:24.625 --> 00:26.760
Aah!

00:26.794 --> 00:27.761
Please, don't!

00:27.795 --> 00:29.097
Police, don't move!

00:29.130 --> 00:30.264
Aah!

00:30.298 --> 00:31.265
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

00:31.299 --> 00:32.366
It's a movie!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.068
Keep rolling, this is great.
Push in on the fat one.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.069
Turn that thing off.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.604
Cut.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.673
We're making a student film.
Rosemary's Bridesmaid.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.609
She's a hell of a screamer,
isn't she?

00:41.642 --> 00:42.843
Who called 911?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.645
I don't know.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.647
You?
Not me.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.282
Dispatch
must have screwed up.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.584
Gotta be 15-D,
not 15-B.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.087
Police!

01:02.630 --> 01:04.732
This is 3-William-56
to dispatch.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.801
Requesting a bus
to 403 West 45th.

01:07.835 --> 01:10.671
And notify SVU.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.873
[camera shutter clicking]

01:12.906 --> 01:16.577
(Benson)
CSU found wedding invitations
in our victim's closet.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.613
"Vicky Emily Riggs
and Alan Anthony Winchell

01:19.647 --> 01:22.583
request the honor of your
presence at their marriage."

01:22.616 --> 01:23.751
When?

01:23.784 --> 01:24.785
Next month.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.188
I don't think
this guy was invited.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.622
"Don't marry him.

01:28.656 --> 01:31.159
"You belong with me.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.593
Marriage is the end of love."

01:32.626 --> 01:33.594
Signed?

01:33.627 --> 01:36.630
No. There are about
a dozen of them over there.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.166
Unopened, no postmark.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.333
Must have been
hand-delivered.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.868
Stalker, maybe
an ex-boyfriend

01:40.901 --> 01:42.270
who didn't want
to see her married?

01:42.303 --> 01:43.671
No sign of forced entry.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.439
He either had a key,
or she let him in.

01:45.473 --> 01:46.440
(Warner)
She has a tan line

01:46.474 --> 01:49.277
on her left
ring finger.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.614
(Benson)
He took her engagement ring.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.183
(Stabler)
One last "screw you"
to the groom.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.517
(Warner)
Literally.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.685
Kit tested positive
for fluids.

01:57.718 --> 01:58.752
From bruising on her neck,

01:58.786 --> 02:01.355
he choked her to death,
maybe during the rape.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.556
What about
this blow to the head?

02:02.590 --> 02:03.591
My guess:

02:03.624 --> 02:04.792
she struggled
during the attack.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.694
Smashed her head
against the head board.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.696
Dispatch said that the 911 call
came from this phone.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.697
Any prints?

02:09.730 --> 02:10.664
Not even the victim's.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.666
Killer wiped it clean.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.235
So he rapes her,
he chokes her,

02:14.268 --> 02:15.703
maybe he doesn't
mean to kill her.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.471
He feels bad,
calls 911.

02:17.505 --> 02:18.439
He didn't feel that bad.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.408
He took her engagement ring
off the body.

02:20.441 --> 02:23.677
If he couldn't have her,
no one could.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.364
Vicky Riggs, 29,
attorney at Jackson and Walsh.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.332
Security guard saw her
leave work at 7:00.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.334
911 call came in at 9:45.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.570
Neighbors heard nothing except
the noise from the student film.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.971
Well, since it wasn't
a break-in,

03:24.004 --> 03:25.406
who had keys
to Vicky's apartment?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.275
According to her fiancÃ©
Alan Winchell,

03:27.308 --> 03:28.609
just the victim,
her, and the landlord.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.677
Landlord was in Phoenix.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.978
Winchell says that
he was at work.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.280
We believe him?

03:32.313 --> 03:33.314
We'll see.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.748
Just make sure
you get him talking.

03:34.782 --> 03:36.650
Morales will
monitor the interview

03:36.684 --> 03:38.986
and compare his voice
to the 911 caller.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.355
You have enough original audio
to make a voice print match?

03:41.389 --> 03:43.424
His 911 call
is only 25 words.

03:43.457 --> 03:46.794
We usually need at least 40.
But I'll give it a shot.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.195
This is the 911 call.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.364
(male operator)
This is operator 604.
Where is your emergency?

03:50.398 --> 03:53.534
(man)
Oh, God.
You gotta help her.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.369
I-I-I don't
know what happened.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.571
Vicky! Vicky!

03:57.605 --> 03:59.640
Can you hear me?

03:59.673 --> 04:02.676
She's not breathing.
I think she's dead.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.845
Hmm, perp knows her.
Calls her by her first name.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.880
FiancÃ©'s looking
pretty good for it.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.350
If you can, try to get him
to use the same words

04:09.383 --> 04:11.285
the 911 caller did.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.854
Did Vicky have any problems
with anyone?

04:13.887 --> 04:15.389
No.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.057
Anybody ever threaten
to hurt her?

04:17.090 --> 04:18.759
No.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.461
Well, what about work?

04:20.494 --> 04:22.296
Any disgruntled clients?

04:22.330 --> 04:25.566
I mean, she defended
the scum of the earth.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.901
She thought she was
saving the world,

04:27.935 --> 04:30.003
one crackhead hooker
at a time.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.406
I thought Jackson Walsh
was a corporate law firm.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.876
They do a lot
of pro bono work.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.078
I mean, Vicky got too close
to those losers,

04:38.111 --> 04:40.414
and I told her
to be careful.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.750
She said I was being
overprotective.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.084
What was I supposed to say

04:44.117 --> 04:47.020
when she brought a junkie
home for dinner?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.789
(Stabler)
Did she mention inviting

04:48.822 --> 04:50.758
one of her clients
over last night?

04:50.791 --> 04:52.526
No.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.729
But sometimes...
they'd just drop by.

04:55.763 --> 04:57.431
(Stabler)
Where were you last night?

04:57.465 --> 04:58.732
(Alan)
At my office.
I'm an architect.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.469
I was working on a presentation
until late.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.470
(Stabler)
How late?

05:02.503 --> 05:03.704
Maybe midnight.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.009
I'm telling you,
I didn't hurt Vicky.

05:09.777 --> 05:10.778
What about her family?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.514
Her mom's in Tulsa.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.084
Oh, God.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.353
How am I gonna tell her
she's dead?

05:21.555 --> 05:23.323
(man on tape)
Oh, God, she's dead.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.870
(Benson)
Is Winchell our guy?

05:36.904 --> 05:39.373
The vocal pattern
is distinctly different.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.641
It's not him.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.642
You know,
those film students

05:41.675 --> 05:43.110
were shooting around Vicky's
building last night.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.712
Maybe they caught
the killer on tape.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.680
I'll send Munch
to pick up the footage.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.548
Talk to Vicky's boss.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.483
Find out if she's been
wining and dining

05:49.517 --> 05:50.951
any crackheads lately.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.823
(Tessa)
You defend
enough criminals,

05:55.856 --> 05:57.024
you learn who barks
and who bites.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.059
Vicky would only let in
someone she trusted.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.661
Well, Vicky's fiancÃ© said
he was worried

06:00.694 --> 06:02.162
about some
of her clients.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.665
Alan didn't like Vicky working
with the huddled masses.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.033
But she loved it.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.067
And you didn't mind her

06:07.100 --> 06:08.736
burning up billable hours

06:08.769 --> 06:10.938
with charity cases?

06:10.971 --> 06:12.873
Being paralyzed, I guess,
makes me a sucker

06:12.906 --> 06:14.442
for hard luck stories.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.510
Was she working on
any case in particular

06:16.544 --> 06:18.412
that would have
gotten her in trouble?

06:20.481 --> 06:22.049
She was handling
a labor law case.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.985
Organizing a union
at the 4-Play Club

06:25.018 --> 06:25.819
in Times Square.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.755
Strippers there
are going on strike?

06:27.788 --> 06:28.922
They threatened to.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.424
The Rimaldi family
doesn't want to pay

06:30.458 --> 06:31.659
for their health insurance
or pension.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.828
Yeah, but if you cross the mob,
you wind up in the landfill.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.064
She was found raped
and murdered in her bed.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.467
All I can tell you is

06:39.500 --> 06:41.569
I did warn Vicky
about the Rimaldis.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.637
I told her
we had to be careful.

06:43.671 --> 06:44.938
You take money
out of their pockets...

06:44.972 --> 06:47.875
you're playing with fire.

06:47.908 --> 06:52.513
[cheering]

06:52.546 --> 06:55.449
Do I look like
a killer to you?

06:55.483 --> 06:57.084
You look like a man who
exploits women

06:57.117 --> 06:58.686
for a living,
Mr. Rimaldi.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.920
Joyce is about
to bleed that guy

06:59.953 --> 07:01.689
for every dollar
in his wallet.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.223
Who's exploiting who?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.592
And you fleece
the both of them.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.693
What's your take
on that, 70%?

07:05.726 --> 07:07.795
Union in here, that'd cut
into your family's profits.

07:07.828 --> 07:09.797
That's why I made a deal
with Vicky.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.099
Okay?
I give them insurance.

07:12.132 --> 07:16.136
I take 80%.
And I gave her a job.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.538
She already has a job.

07:17.571 --> 07:18.906
What would she want
to work with you for?

07:18.939 --> 07:20.841
She wanted to dance.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.910
Great rack.
Who was I to say no?

07:24.812 --> 07:25.979
Vicky danced here?

07:26.013 --> 07:27.681
Yeah.
Naked?

07:27.715 --> 07:29.717
She kept her shoes on.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.519
Come on.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.686
Three nights a week
up there with Miss Josie.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.654
Should have seen the sack.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.656
By the grand finale,
guys were throwing 50s,

07:35.689 --> 07:37.991
100s on the stage.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.560
She didn't do it
for the cash.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.728
She liked dancing.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.864
Having every guy in a room
wrapped around your finger.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.766
It's a power trip.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.868
She tell her fiancÃ©
about what she was doing?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.837
I didn't ask,
she didn't tell.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.105
All I know...

07:52.139 --> 07:54.608
she could not wait
to get married.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.779
Vicky ever have a problem
with any of her customers

07:58.812 --> 08:00.814
getting too close?

08:00.848 --> 08:03.851
There was one guy, Tim.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.053
She called him
the wiener man.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.756
He liked to grab his package
while she danced.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.991
I think he followed her home
from work a couple of times.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.826
Where can we find this Tim?

08:12.860 --> 08:15.963
Weiner World.
Sells hot dogs.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.166
Hey, Tim, heard you
got a great wiener.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.901
The best in town.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.135
Well, the girls
at the 4-Play

08:22.169 --> 08:24.972
say your dog's
no big thang.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.807
What's this about?

08:26.840 --> 08:27.941
Vicky Riggs.

08:27.975 --> 08:30.010
We hear you're
her number one fan.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.979
She's my girlfriend.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.947
We're getting married.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.749
Really?

08:35.783 --> 08:38.251
Tonight's the night.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.187
I'm gonna propose.

08:40.220 --> 08:43.824
That's a nice rock.
Mind if I take a look?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.125
Vicky and Alan forever.

08:45.158 --> 08:46.126
Where's that leave you, Tim?

08:46.159 --> 08:48.962
I can explain.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.798
We can't wait
to hear it.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.232
(Tim)
She was beautiful.

08:52.265 --> 08:55.235
Alan wasn't right
for Vicky.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.971
He didn't appreciate
how special she was.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.139
Oh, is that why
you wrote

08:59.172 --> 09:00.841
these threatening
letters to her?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.209
I wasn't threatening her.

09:02.242 --> 09:05.345
I was warning her.
She wouldn't have been happy.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.314
What, are you
a therapist now, wiener man?

09:07.347 --> 09:09.249
Vicky didn't love Alan.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.619
She wasn't gonna marry him.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.053
She tell you that
between lap dances?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.588
After work.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.789
(Stabler)
When you followed her home.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.858
I was making sure
she was safe.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.226
You were stalking her.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.994
I was protecting her!

09:21.028 --> 09:23.030
The only protection she needed
was from guys like you.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.098
There are bad people
out there.

09:25.132 --> 09:29.236
She had no idea what some men
are capable of.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.738
So what are you
capable of, Tim?

09:30.771 --> 09:32.239
Stalking, murder, rape.

09:32.272 --> 09:35.075
What are you talking about?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.744
We're talking
about you raping

09:36.777 --> 09:38.078
and choking Vicky Riggs
to death.

09:38.111 --> 09:40.080
No. I would never
hurt Vicky.

09:40.113 --> 09:40.914
I loved her!

09:40.948 --> 09:42.916
You loved her so much,
you killed her,

09:42.950 --> 09:43.984
and you stole this
off her corpse?

09:44.017 --> 09:45.385
I got that
from the trash!

09:45.418 --> 09:47.087
Trash.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.388
She threw it out.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.925
Behind the club, after
that jerk Alan dumped her.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.898
(Alan)
We were calling off
the wedding.

09:57.931 --> 09:58.999
(Benson)
Why?

09:59.032 --> 10:01.334
Last week, the guys took me out
for a bachelor party.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.637
And we hit every
strip club in town.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.272
Including the 4-Play.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.907
We walked in and...

10:06.940 --> 10:10.077
there was Vicky
grinding on some guy.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.179
Some of the guys
thought it was hot.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.415
I just went outside
and puked.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.085
I called her later
and told her we were finished.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.021
Why did you lie to us?

10:21.054 --> 10:24.024
I didn't want her face
all over the tabloids.

10:24.057 --> 10:27.661
"Lawyer by day,
stripper by night."

10:27.695 --> 10:31.131
I wouldn't want my fiancÃ©
stripping for money.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.033
I'd kill him.

10:33.066 --> 10:36.369
I didn't hurt her.

10:36.403 --> 10:40.173
I told you, I was here.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.975
Alan Winchell's alibi
checks out.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.076
He was at the office.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.211
No time to slip out
and kill Vicky.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.379
And his voice didn't match
the 911 caller.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.982
Weiner Man
isn't our mystery caller.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.684
Morales just finished
the voice analysis.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.819
No match.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.053
I might have
a match for you.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.055
Our student Scorsese
was filming exteriors

10:55.088 --> 10:56.757
outside Vicky's apartment.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.726
Caught her in the background
with this guy.

10:58.759 --> 10:59.827
Student's gonna give us
the footage for free

10:59.860 --> 11:04.064
in exchange for a blurb
from a real-life NYPD captain.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.999
"I catch killers
for a living,

11:06.033 --> 11:08.068
"but even I wasn't prepared
for the horror

11:08.101 --> 11:09.970
of Rosemary's Bridesmaid."

11:10.003 --> 11:10.971
I gotta say this?

11:11.004 --> 11:11.872
I've seen it.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.406
Believe me,
nothing could prepare you

11:13.440 --> 11:15.008
for this piece of schlock.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.077
I asked TARU to blow up
some stills from the movie.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.111
Check it out.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.047
There's Vicky going into
the building with our guy.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.449
(Munch)
Camera log says this happened
about 8:15.

11:22.482 --> 11:24.351
That's an hour
before Vicky died.

11:24.384 --> 11:25.886
Not even inside yet,
and it looks like

11:25.919 --> 11:27.020
he's about to make
a DNA deposit.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.922
Maybe she met him
at the club,

11:28.956 --> 11:30.490
brought him home.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.026
(Munch)
This is no ordinary pickup.
Our boy's got a key.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.095
(Benson)
We're not looking for a rapist.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.831
We're looking
for her lover.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.105
I may have a way to I.D.
Vicky's mystery lover.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.240
I called in a favor
from the state police.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.942
They have access
to every driver's license

11:48.976 --> 11:50.243
issued in New York.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.945
So if the guy
in your picture has one,

11:51.979 --> 11:52.946
we'll find him.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.047
We're gonna look through

11:54.081 --> 11:55.148
11 million
driver's licenses?

11:55.182 --> 11:57.184
Not us...
the computers.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.252
First, we magnify
the photo.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.788
Then we compare it
to an image

12:00.821 --> 12:02.522
in the DMV database.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.758
Like Elliot's.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.459
Nice picture!
Let's see yours.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.896
(Morales)
Facial recognition software
does the rest.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.798
Congratulations.
You're not our perp.

12:10.831 --> 12:15.102
We continue the process until
the computers find our guy.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.137
I set the search parameters
to male, white,

12:17.170 --> 12:18.271
age 30 to 50.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.207
How accurate
is this software?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.341
Depends on the quality
of the photo.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.442
The higher-res the image,

12:22.475 --> 12:23.811
the more likely
we'll get a match.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.045
Homeland security wants
to use this

12:25.078 --> 12:26.279
for a national I.D. system.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.181
[beeping]

12:28.215 --> 12:29.316
We got something.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.388
(Stabler)
Linus McKellen.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.957
How do I know
that name?

12:36.990 --> 12:38.859
Tessa McKellen.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.894
Vicky's boss.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.032
(Linus)
I'm her husband.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.800
Tessa's in the living room.

12:46.834 --> 12:48.168
I was just about
to give her her insulin.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.569
If you, uh,
if you wait here,

12:49.602 --> 12:50.904
she'll be right out.

12:50.938 --> 12:51.939
We're here
to talk to you.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.106
About Vicky Riggs.

12:53.140 --> 12:56.443
Tessa told me what happened.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.577
So how can I help?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.213
(Stabler)
Well, how well
did you know her?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.916
She took over a lot
of Tessa's cases

13:02.950 --> 13:04.952
after my wife's accident
three years ago.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.086
Have you seen Vicky
recently?

13:06.119 --> 13:08.388
Linus.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.057
Excuse me.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.859
Detectives, please,
come in.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.127
Do you have news
about Vicky?

13:14.161 --> 13:17.430
We need to ask your husband
a few questions about her.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.432
(Stabler)
Nice sculpture.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.600
(Tessa)
That's my father.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.902
Amazing, huh?

13:21.935 --> 13:24.905
He had an incredible eye
for art.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.073
I inherited his collection

13:26.106 --> 13:28.275
along with his...
house.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.010
Mrs. McKellen, we need to speak
to your husband in private.

13:30.043 --> 13:33.580
As his attorney,
I'm afraid I can't let you.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.615
Ready for
my daily torture.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.417
Mr. McKellen,
are you a doctor?

13:37.450 --> 13:41.021
No...I just
take care of Tessa.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.055
This photo was taken

13:42.089 --> 13:43.156
8:15 Wednesday night,

13:43.190 --> 13:45.825
an hour before
Vicky was murdered.

13:47.594 --> 13:48.962
I ran into Vicky.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.130
In Times Square.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.298
Walked her home.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.499
(Tessa)
He told me about it.

13:52.532 --> 13:53.934
When he got back.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.035
Why didn't
you tell us?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.569
I didn't think
it was relevant.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.271
Your husband ran into
a homicide victim

13:58.305 --> 13:59.439
the night of her murder,

13:59.472 --> 14:01.374
but you didn't think
it was relevant?

14:01.408 --> 14:04.044
Maybe you need
a new attorney.

14:04.077 --> 14:05.979
Linus had nothing to do
with Vicky's death.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.981
Mr. McKellen, where were you
at 9:15 on Wednesday night?

14:08.015 --> 14:09.883
I was stuck in traffic.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.284
That's the downside
to living in Mount Pleasant.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.986
I didn't get home
till after 10:00.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.354
(Benson)
You stop anywhere
on the way home?

14:14.387 --> 14:15.622
Bite to eat,
go to the bathroom?

14:15.655 --> 14:16.623
Anything like that?

14:16.656 --> 14:17.891
(Linus)
No.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.993
(Tessa)
I don't appreciate
this line of questioning.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.261
You should leave now.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.896
Mr. McKellen,
this coat here.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.631
Is that the same one
that's in the photo here?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.033
Yes.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.968
How'd you get blood
on the sleeve?

14:28.001 --> 14:30.237
I had a nose bleed
last night.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.072
It's mine.

14:32.105 --> 14:33.506
We're gonna need a DNA sample
from both of you.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.508
(laughs)
Then you better
get a court order.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.676
We will.
Come with us, please.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.145
Are you arresting him?

14:38.178 --> 14:39.479
No, we just need to
interview your husband

14:39.512 --> 14:41.081
officially
down at the station.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.315
Then I'm coming with you.
No.

14:42.349 --> 14:45.685
No, you stay here
and rest.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.388
You've got nothing
to worry about.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.191
(man)
Vicky! Vicky!
Can you hear me?

14:51.224 --> 14:56.096
She's not breathing.
I think she's dead.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.098
Looks like we
have a winner.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.933
Only the lab
will say for sure.

14:59.967 --> 15:02.635
Linus, what do you think
will convict you?

15:02.669 --> 15:04.504
Your sperm inside
the victim,

15:04.537 --> 15:06.539
her blood on your coat,
or...

15:06.573 --> 15:08.241
your voice
here on the tape?

15:08.275 --> 15:11.011
Why don't we listen
to it again?
No, don't.
It's me.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.547
I called 911 when
I found Vicky's body.

15:16.984 --> 15:19.386
We were having an affair.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.222
I haven't been able
to have sex with my wife

15:22.255 --> 15:24.124
since her accident.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.994
Vicky was smart, pretty.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.561
It just happened.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.997
And you fell in love
with her.
No.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.465
No, I love my wife.
It was a fling.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.466
That's all.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.202
Vicky feel the same way?

15:35.235 --> 15:37.337
She wanted me
to leave Tessa.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.438
I couldn't.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.506
Why not?

15:39.539 --> 15:43.276
My wife's paralysis
is my fault.

15:43.310 --> 15:47.047
I was driving.
We hit black ice.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.715
I walked away.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.618
So you stay
out of guilt and...

15:51.651 --> 15:53.653
screw around on the side.

15:56.323 --> 15:58.058
Did Vicky threaten
to tell Tessa?

15:58.091 --> 15:59.192
That why you killed her?

15:59.226 --> 16:01.161
No. We had sex.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.529
I left.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.031
On my way to the car,

16:04.064 --> 16:05.565
I realized that I'd
forgotten my watch.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.766
I went back to get it.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.768
That's when
I found Vicky's body.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.770
Well, if you
didn't kill her,

16:10.803 --> 16:12.105
why didn't you stay?

16:12.139 --> 16:14.507
I didn't want Tessa
to find out.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.775
She's sick.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.277
It would have destroyed her.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.212
Do you really
expect us to believe

16:19.246 --> 16:21.014
that in the five minutes

16:21.048 --> 16:22.515
that you went
out of that apartment,

16:22.549 --> 16:25.018
somebody else slipped in
and murdered Vicky?
Yes.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.186
Look, if Vicky's death
was an accident,

16:26.219 --> 16:27.387
maybe it wasn't even
your fault.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.421
We can help you out.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.523
Test my DNA.
Test the damn coat.

16:30.557 --> 16:33.126
But I swear to God,
I didn't kill Vicky.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.728
There's no way anyone else
could have done this.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.564
We got him dead to rights.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.432
The film students
were shooting in the lobby

16:39.466 --> 16:41.334
between 8:00 and 9:30.

16:41.368 --> 16:43.470
Six people came and went,
all excluded,

16:43.503 --> 16:44.771
except for Linus.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.074
And they got a shot of him
leaving at 9:12.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.208
Right around the time
of Vicky's death.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.177
He'll plead out.
No, he won't.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.445
I'll get the case thrown out.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.746
On what grounds?

16:53.780 --> 16:55.182
Violation
of due process.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.117
I read the case report.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.119
Police had no right
to dig through my client's

16:59.152 --> 17:01.088
DMV records.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.127
(Judge Petrovsky)
The police use DMV records
all the time.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.395
There's no privacy issue.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.496
It's not about privacy,
your honor.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.231
It's about technology.

17:11.264 --> 17:13.400
The police didn't
search the DMV records.

17:13.433 --> 17:15.168
A computer program did.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.103
Well, the police use

17:16.136 --> 17:18.071
computer-assisted searches
all the time.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.839
That's how they make
fingerprint matches.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.408
According to the Frye
standard,

17:21.441 --> 17:24.211
a scientific technique
cannot be used

17:24.244 --> 17:26.146
unless it has been tested
and found reliable

17:26.179 --> 17:28.315
within
scientific communities.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.283
This facial recognition
software

17:30.317 --> 17:32.152
fails to meet
those standards.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.121
This software is used
by government agencies

17:34.154 --> 17:35.122
across the country.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.090
It's unreliable.

17:37.124 --> 17:40.327
CNN showed how this software
couldn't match up

17:40.360 --> 17:43.096
a correspondent's photo
with his driver's license.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.298
Are you aware of this,
Ms. Novak?

17:45.332 --> 17:46.799
The technology is new,

17:46.833 --> 17:48.868
but that doesn't mean
it's unreliable.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.204
In our case, it identified
the right person

17:51.238 --> 17:52.872
who then confessed
to being at the scene

17:52.905 --> 17:54.241
on the night
of the murder.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.276
And admission made
after the police

17:56.309 --> 17:58.478
broke evidentiary
procedure

17:58.511 --> 18:00.780
by using technology
unapproved by the court.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.150
The detectives were acting
in good faith.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.785
The detectives identified
my client unlawfully.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.455
Which makes any evidence
stemming from that ID

18:08.488 --> 18:09.622
inadmissible.

18:09.656 --> 18:13.126
I have to agree.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.561
The ID is out.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.762
So is everything
that came after it.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.131
Including Mr. McKellen's
arrest.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.168
Linus' affair with Vicky,
the DNA samples,

18:21.201 --> 18:22.602
the blood on his coat,
it's all thrown out.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.404
For what it's worth,
the blood on Linus' coat

18:24.437 --> 18:25.572
wasn't Vicky's,
it was Tessa's.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.774
I guess her nosebleed story
panned out.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.342
All we need is one
piece of evidence

18:29.376 --> 18:30.777
that leads us back
to Linus.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.245
Then everything we know
goes back in.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.580
We have Vicky's
phone records.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.782
If she called Linus,
we can re-interview him.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.284
Vicky didn't.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.351
The only phone calls
that she made

18:38.385 --> 18:39.819
were to Tessa McKellen

18:39.852 --> 18:41.221
at three different
phone numbers.

18:41.254 --> 18:43.690
One work, two cellulars.

18:43.723 --> 18:44.857
Why does somebody need
two cell phones?

18:44.891 --> 18:47.494
Well, Tessa's name
could be on both phones

18:47.527 --> 18:49.229
but Linus is using
one of them.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.798
(Benson)
Yeah, and I bet I know
which one.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.466
This cell phone made
dozens of calls to Vicky Riggs

18:53.500 --> 18:55.568
in the middle of the night.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.603
Guess who else he called?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.905
Josie Post.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.541
It's Vicky's stripper friend
from the 4-Play.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.245
[knocking on door]

19:05.278 --> 19:09.716
Josie, it's detectives
Benson and Stabler.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.267
She's dead.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.536
Whatever she knew,
Linus didn't want her to tell.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.338
Looks like there's fluids
on her skirt.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.939
(Stabler)
This is one sick
son of a bitch.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.274
He just can't
help himself.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.408
But how did he get
in and out

19:35.442 --> 19:38.545
with the chain
still on the door?

19:38.578 --> 19:39.912
Only way in is
through those windows.

19:39.946 --> 19:43.750
No fire escape.

19:47.787 --> 19:51.591
And we're eight
stories up.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.659
The only person who could have
gotten in here

19:52.692 --> 19:54.026
is Spider-Man.

19:57.897 --> 20:00.700
No window washing equipment.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.206
Elliot, check this out.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.681
Spider-Man.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.424
Same boot print as
the one you found

20:24.457 --> 20:25.925
in Josie Post's apartment.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.660
Vicky Riggs didn't
open the door for her killer,

20:27.694 --> 20:28.961
he came in through
the window.

20:28.995 --> 20:30.730
So Spider-Man either
climbed up 15 stories

20:30.763 --> 20:31.964
or repelled down?
He repelled.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.734
Your perp tied his tether
to this pipe.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.336
See the friction marks?

20:36.369 --> 20:38.037
He lowered himself down.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.706
We found the same marks
on a chimney stack

20:39.739 --> 20:41.007
on the roof
of Josie's building.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.108
How'd he get up here
in the first place?

20:42.141 --> 20:44.411
Super said the door
to the roof is always locked.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.045
He didn't come through
this building.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.615
He used that cable
to cross over.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.784
What, are you serious?
Hand over hand?

20:51.818 --> 20:54.554
Was Linus McKellen
ever in a circus?

20:54.587 --> 20:57.724
Either that or someone's
setting him up.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.426
I have no idea who would
wanna frame me.

20:59.459 --> 21:02.061
Do you have any enemies?
People threatening you?

21:02.094 --> 21:02.929
No.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.665
I spend all my time
at home with Tessa.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.934
These murders have nothing
to do with me.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.502
You slept with both victims.

21:09.536 --> 21:11.003
I never slept with
Josie Post.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.872
We found your semen
inside her.

21:12.905 --> 21:16.075
That's impossible.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.377
Hey, we don't care if you're
screwing half the strippers

21:17.410 --> 21:18.511
in the city.

21:18.545 --> 21:19.612
But you gotta
stop lying to us.

21:19.646 --> 21:22.882
I'm not.
I told you...

21:22.915 --> 21:25.752
I slept with Vicky.
I never met Josie Post.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.720
You called her
dozens of times.

21:27.754 --> 21:31.090
Well, me and Vicky
used her place sometimes.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.059
I called Josie
to set it up.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.727
Right, but you never met her.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.363
So how'd your DNA
wind up inside her?

21:39.065 --> 21:41.033
Whoever's setting me up
put it there.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.969
Well, how did they
get your sperm?

21:43.002 --> 21:44.704
I mean, you just leave it
lying around?

21:44.737 --> 21:47.374
I wish I knew.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.676
Then I could prove
I was telling the truth.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.813
I believe Linus--I don't think
he slept with Josie.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.482
A man's DNA doesn't just pop up
inside a woman

21:55.515 --> 21:56.916
without his participation.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.618
He's talked to us twice
without a lawyer.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.786
He's not hiding anything.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.622
Linus is basically
a nursemaid.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.056
He stays home with Tessa.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.057
Now, why would that piss
somebody off so much

22:05.091 --> 22:07.660
that they'd wanna try
to send him to prison?

22:07.694 --> 22:10.096
Maybe the killer's trying
to hurt Tessa.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.532
If Linus goes away,
she's the one that suffers.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.100
She's completely dependent
on him.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.102
Wouldn't be the first time
somebody tried to get revenge

22:16.135 --> 22:18.471
against a lawyer
by hurting their family.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.879
Come in, Detectives.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.548
Linus told me
you'd be stopping by.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.649
[coughs]

22:32.419 --> 22:33.753
You feel up to talking?

22:33.786 --> 22:35.822
I've got pneumonia.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.790
The diabetes
and the paralysis

22:37.824 --> 22:41.127
makes my body more susceptible
to infection.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.929
Must be rough.

22:42.962 --> 22:47.567
Linus takes
good care of me.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.069
Your firm deals with a lot
of high profile cases.

22:50.102 --> 22:54.106
Could one of your clients
be trying to frame your husband

22:54.140 --> 22:56.142
to hurt you?

22:56.175 --> 23:00.880
I'm not a criminal attorney.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.583
I don't handle
killers and rapists.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.818
You handle
multimillion-dollar lawsuits.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.620
That kind of money
can turn people ugly.

23:07.654 --> 23:11.824
And even the ugliest deserves
attorney-client privilege.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.192
I can't hand you a list
and go let you

23:13.225 --> 23:14.827
interrogate my clients.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.729
I promise you
we'll be discreet.

23:16.763 --> 23:20.533
I'll be disbarred if I violate
privilege, Detective.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.169
You do know whoever
killed these women

23:23.202 --> 23:25.037
could've sent your husband
away for life.

23:25.071 --> 23:28.975
I know.

23:29.008 --> 23:32.912
But I'm still bound by my
professional code of ethics.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.584
We copied every public record
we could find.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.085
Every case that
Tessa McKellen handled

23:39.118 --> 23:41.621
in the past five years.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.089
That's it?

23:43.122 --> 23:44.524
Well, she only does
three cases a year

23:44.557 --> 23:45.324
because of her
medical condition.

23:45.357 --> 23:46.859
She still makes
a partner's salary?

23:46.893 --> 23:48.561
She's living the high life
on daddy's money.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.598
The court clerk said that
her father founded the firm

23:51.631 --> 23:52.765
and left her his half
when he died last year.

23:52.799 --> 23:56.035
Tessa won ten million bucks
on a copyright case last year.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.236
Check this one out.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.840
Silverhammer Protection
vs. United States.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.141
She sued the Department
of Defense

24:02.174 --> 24:03.142
for a $100 million.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.077
Over what?

24:05.111 --> 24:07.013
Looks like the reneged
on a handshake agreement

24:07.046 --> 24:08.881
with a private military
corporation.

24:08.915 --> 24:12.852
The court threw out the suit.
Silverhammer lost.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.020
$100 million
is a lot of money to lose

24:14.053 --> 24:15.955
over a bunch
of rent-a-cops.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.824
PMCs aren't rent-a-cops
or security guards.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.026
It's a billion dollar
a year industry.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.260
What do PMCs do?

24:21.293 --> 24:23.730
Profit from the fighting
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

24:23.763 --> 24:26.098
Don't get him started
on Dick Cheney again.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.900
Here it is,
Silverhammer Protection.

24:30.570 --> 24:33.906
Run by Jeffrey Sobchak
ex-Delta Force Commander.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.808
Professional mercenaries
and bodyguards for hire.

24:35.842 --> 24:38.110
And Tessa lost them
that big fat contract.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.846
I bet one of these
Silverhammer guys

24:39.879 --> 24:41.047
is our Spider-Man.

24:43.049 --> 24:45.818
(Sobchak)
Look. I know people think

24:45.852 --> 24:47.019
we're just guns for hire.

24:47.053 --> 24:49.622
Silverhammer's employees
are not mercenaries.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.824
We're private citizens
with specialized training

24:51.858 --> 24:53.560
who subcontract
to our armed forces.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.295
You jump into ugly situations
for a heap of cash.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.197
We do what
we're asked to.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.899
The State Department allocates
a billion dollars a year

24:59.932 --> 25:02.001
to Private Military
Corporations.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.570
You must have been
pretty upset

25:03.603 --> 25:05.204
when you lost
your government contract.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.206
Well, there's always
trouble somewhere.

25:07.239 --> 25:10.977
A Liberia or a Sierra Leone
in need of our services.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.144
And we're always looking
for a few good men.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.914
And women.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.683
How many good men
did you have to fire

25:16.716 --> 25:18.317
when Tessa McKellen lost you
$100 million?

25:18.350 --> 25:21.087
About 50.

25:21.120 --> 25:21.854
Damn shame.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.923
Yeah?
We'll need their names.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.792
I'll need
a court order first.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.627
Okay.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.729
But I'll tell ya, if our DA
has to get a court order,

25:29.762 --> 25:31.664
she's gonna want to open
a whole grand jury investigation

25:31.698 --> 25:34.066
into your operation.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.334
But I'm sure you have
valid documentation

25:35.367 --> 25:37.169
for all your weapons,
right?

25:42.008 --> 25:43.342
We do thorough
background checks.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.811
Psych screenings.

25:44.844 --> 25:45.845
We don't hire nut-jobs.

25:45.878 --> 25:46.846
What about the wash-outs?

25:46.879 --> 25:48.781
I hire the best
of the best.

25:48.815 --> 25:49.949
All my men are rock stars.

25:49.982 --> 25:50.883
Yeah?

25:50.917 --> 25:53.753
Well, this rock star
has a criminal record.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.054
Walter Inman.

25:55.087 --> 25:57.189
Domestic violence,
assault, burglary.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.358
He had a beef with some girl
he was banging.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.795
Infiltration specialist.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.631
With an expert rating
in mountaineering.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.200
Walter Inman!

26:08.234 --> 26:09.636
Yeah?
Police.

26:09.669 --> 26:13.172
We need to ask you
a few questions.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.643
Mr. Inman.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.044
He's running.

26:27.654 --> 26:30.056
Liv, radio down!

26:34.360 --> 26:36.028
Fin, he went out
the window.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.063
He's coming down now.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.103
That's far enough, Spidey!

26:44.136 --> 26:45.204
Walter Inman,
you are under arrest

26:45.237 --> 26:47.073
for the murder
of Vicky Riggs.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.041
Hey!

26:49.075 --> 26:51.077
Freeze!
Hands up!

26:51.110 --> 26:53.245
Hands up!

26:53.279 --> 26:55.982
Up!

26:56.015 --> 26:57.717
All right, let's try
that again!

26:57.750 --> 26:59.051
Walter Inman,
you are under arrest

26:59.085 --> 27:01.420
for the murder of Vicky Riggs
and Josie Post.

27:01.453 --> 27:05.257
And for assaulting one
of New York's finest finest.

27:06.959 --> 27:10.096
Found these boots
in your closet.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.232
The soles are
a perfect match...

27:13.265 --> 27:15.935
to the boot prints
at both crime scenes.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.937
It's a popular shoe.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.439
You're a pretty
smart guy, Walter.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.075
You really had us stumped,
but you made one mistake.

27:23.109 --> 27:27.880
You left the chain latched
on Josie Post's front door.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.015
That's how we knew
Linus McKellen didn't kill her.

27:29.048 --> 27:34.153
And that's what led us
to your big messy boot prints.

27:34.186 --> 27:36.155
Now where did you
get Linus' semen?

27:36.188 --> 27:40.827
Did you two have little
'don't ask don't tell'

27:40.860 --> 27:43.195
thing going?
[scoffs]

27:43.229 --> 27:47.399
Walter, why'd you do it?

27:47.433 --> 27:50.703
I don't know
what you're talking about.

27:50.737 --> 27:53.472
But if you get any closer...

27:53.505 --> 27:55.141
I'll jam my knee
in your balls so hard

27:55.174 --> 27:57.309
you'll have to spit 'em out.

28:00.312 --> 28:01.714
You didn't think you could
pull a confession

28:01.748 --> 28:03.916
out of Inman, did you?
I don't get it.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.918
G.I. Jerk wants revenge
against Tessa.

28:05.952 --> 28:07.787
So he kills Vicky and Josie?

28:07.820 --> 28:08.988
Why not just murder Tessa?

28:09.021 --> 28:10.189
Because he wanted her
to suffer.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.190
That's why
he framed her husband.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.825
The thing that
I don't understand,

28:12.859 --> 28:16.796
is how Inman got Linus' DNA
inside Josie Post.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.731
Maybe he was shadowing Linus,

28:18.765 --> 28:20.066
saw he was having
an affair with Vicky

28:20.099 --> 28:21.267
and stole a used condom.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.401
That sets him up
for 50-to-life.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.937
I miss the days when revenge
just meant shooting someone.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.005
And I miss the days
when I never

28:26.038 --> 28:28.507
had to say "I ran more
DNA tests on that semen."

28:28.540 --> 28:29.742
Sample from Josie Post?

28:29.776 --> 28:33.445
Yep, I found amylase mixed in
with Linus McKellen's sperm.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.815
Amylase, that's in saliva
isn't it?

28:35.848 --> 28:37.316
It's an enzyme.

28:37.349 --> 28:40.152
It didn't match Linus' DNA
or Josie's.

28:40.186 --> 28:43.890
So I ran it against
the DNA sample from his coat.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.258
Tessa's blood
from her nosebleed.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.360
It's Tessa's saliva mixed in
with Linus' DNA.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.897
She performed oral sex
on her husband

28:50.930 --> 28:51.998
and saved the sperm?

28:52.031 --> 28:53.866
Then she gave it
to Walter Inman

28:53.900 --> 28:56.135
to plant in Josie Post.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.370
Inman wasn't trying
to get back at Tessa.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.307
She hired him
to frame her husband.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.380
What possible reason
would I have

29:08.414 --> 29:09.782
to frame my husband?

29:09.816 --> 29:11.150
(Benson)
Revenge.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.419
Your husband cheated on you,
and you wanted him to pay.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.789
I didn't know Linus
was having an affair...

29:16.823 --> 29:17.924
until you told me.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.959
All those calls
between Linus and Vicky.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.360
You were never
suspicious?

29:21.393 --> 29:23.362
(Walsh)
Look, even if my client
had an inkling,

29:23.395 --> 29:25.832
your theory
that she hired

29:25.865 --> 29:27.433
a professional assassin

29:27.466 --> 29:29.368
to kill her
husband's mistress

29:29.401 --> 29:31.403
and then to frame him
is ridiculous.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.805
Not as ridiculous
as her behavior.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.275
You performed oral sex
on your husband

29:36.308 --> 29:37.376
to get his DNA.

29:37.409 --> 29:40.346
Incorrect.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.415
It's the only way he and I have
to be intimate.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.986
(Walsh)
My client and her husband
engaged in sexual activity.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.856
So her saliva was on him.

29:49.889 --> 29:52.992
So, when Linus had sex
with Josie Post,

29:53.025 --> 29:54.827
Tessa's DNA
went along for the ride.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.929
Okay.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.330
There's one problem
with that theory.

29:58.364 --> 29:59.598
Linus didn't have sex
with Josie.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.233
Well, so he says.
Why would he lie?

30:01.267 --> 30:02.368
He already admitted
to one affair.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.535
Why deny another?

30:03.569 --> 30:07.539
Even if he had ten affairs,
I would never hurt Linus.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.075
I love him.

30:09.108 --> 30:11.143
And you didn't
want him to leave.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.279
You'd rather see your husband
behind bars

30:13.312 --> 30:14.313
than with another woman.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.415
I need him.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.417
I couldn't survive
without him.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.418
That's enough,
we're leaving.

30:19.451 --> 30:24.056
Unless you have enough evidence
to arrest Tessa?

30:24.090 --> 30:25.591
No, I didn't think so.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.628
I need Walter Inman
to flip on Tessa.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.598
He won't talk
without a deal.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.066
Well, I'd hate
to give him one.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.267
He planned and executed
the murders

30:35.301 --> 30:36.502
of two innocent women.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.504
And got paid
big bucks to do it.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.539
His daughter Phoebe
is a freshman at Columbia.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.374
He paid her tuition
in cash.

30:42.408 --> 30:43.442
So he's using blood money

30:43.475 --> 30:44.977
to put his kid
through college.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.345
Where's he keepin' the money?

30:46.378 --> 30:47.413
College said it was wired

30:47.446 --> 30:49.581
from an account
in Grand Cayman.

30:51.984 --> 30:55.354
(Novak)
Ever heard of the
Son of Sam law, Walter?

30:55.387 --> 30:58.891
You're not allowed to profit
from illegal activities.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.026
I haven't done anything
illegal.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.461
You can try and prove that
at trial,

31:02.494 --> 31:03.930
but until you do,
all of your accounts

31:03.963 --> 31:04.997
have been frozen.

31:05.031 --> 31:08.134
Including the one
in Grand Cayman.

31:08.167 --> 31:12.171
How will Phoebe
pay for school?

31:18.644 --> 31:21.280
If I confess...

31:21.313 --> 31:23.382
will you leave
my money alone?

31:23.415 --> 31:25.051
You testify
against Tessa McKellen,

31:25.084 --> 31:26.385
and I'll allow you
to transfer enough money

31:26.418 --> 31:28.988
to your daughter
to pay for her education.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.190
No deal.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.561
Okay, fine.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.096
I'll tell Phoebe
to pack her bags.

31:37.129 --> 31:37.829
Guard!

31:37.863 --> 31:39.365
I'll tell you
what you need.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.637
I'm listening.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.240
Tessa came to me after
Silverhammer fired me.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.442
She thought her husband
was cheating on her,

31:50.476 --> 31:52.411
so she hired me
to trail him.

31:52.444 --> 31:54.080
I followed him
to two stripper's apartments.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.548
Vicky and Josie.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.384
I told Tessa he was
banging both of them.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.086
You were wrong, he wasn't
sleeping with Josie.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.288
So you killed a girl
for no reason at all.

32:05.191 --> 32:08.394
You do any other jobs
for Tessa?

32:08.427 --> 32:10.729
No hits.
A little B & E.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.100
What did you steal?

32:14.133 --> 32:16.002
Some stuff from a lab.

32:16.035 --> 32:18.304
What stuff?

32:18.337 --> 32:21.073
Viruses.

32:21.107 --> 32:24.010
Bacteria.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.212
Strepto-pneumo something
was one.

32:26.245 --> 32:28.680
Why did she want that?

32:28.714 --> 32:31.450
I thought she was gonna
whack her husband,

32:31.483 --> 32:33.252
but she used it
on herself.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.722
I saw her inject that crap
right into her arm.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.291
Can you prove this?

32:39.325 --> 32:41.293
Yeah.

32:41.327 --> 32:43.195
She gave me a shopping list
of all the stuff she needed

32:43.229 --> 32:45.197
from the lab.

32:45.231 --> 32:46.298
In her own handwriting.

32:46.332 --> 32:51.037
Give me the list
and you've got a deal.

32:52.804 --> 32:55.341
Hey, put that down.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.509
What are you doing?
I need my insulin.

32:57.543 --> 32:58.577
With a meningitis chaser?

32:58.610 --> 33:00.079
Leave her alone.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.780
Linus, they're taking
my insulin.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.715
Your wife has been
making herself sick.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.251
Injecting herself
with all kinds of germs.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.185
That is disgusting.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.287
Well, Inman gave you up.
You're under arrest.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.421
What are you saying?

33:09.455 --> 33:12.091
She hired a hit man
to frame you.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.226
Linus help me.
I'm gonna faint.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.794
Arrest me, it's my fault.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.396
I paralyzed my wife.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.298
I had an affair,
I made her sick.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.467
She wasn't too sick
to plan two murders.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.202
I need my insulin, please.

33:23.235 --> 33:25.304
Oh, you'll get that
at central booking.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.341
From everything that
you're telling me,

33:29.375 --> 33:32.278
it seems to me that Tessa
has a factitious disorder.

33:32.311 --> 33:33.479
Munchausen's Syndrome.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.447
She's making herself sick
to get attention?

33:35.481 --> 33:37.149
She was in a nearly fatal
car accident

33:37.183 --> 33:39.318
and she does have diabetes.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.520
The syringe that Olivia
and Elliot took from her

33:41.553 --> 33:42.488
contained insulin.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.390
But my guess is that
she just became addicted

33:44.423 --> 33:46.192
to all the attention she gets
being sick.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.359
Well, it's one thing

33:47.393 --> 33:49.161
to play sick
to get attention,

33:49.195 --> 33:50.162
and another
to inject yourself

33:50.196 --> 33:51.597
with streptococcus bacteria.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.099
I mean,
she could have died.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.167
People with Munchausen's
often do.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.169
I once had a patient
who used a catheter

33:57.203 --> 33:58.204
to pump egg whites
into her kidneys

33:58.237 --> 33:59.438
to cause renal failure.

33:59.471 --> 34:01.373
She was about to be
on the transplant list

34:01.407 --> 34:03.275
when we caught her.

34:03.309 --> 34:04.210
But Tessa knows
the difference

34:04.243 --> 34:05.244
between right and wrong.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.612
That's true.

34:06.645 --> 34:09.215
She hired that hit man,
and she planned those murders

34:09.248 --> 34:11.283
to punish her husband
for cheating on her.

34:11.317 --> 34:13.252
Once he was in prison,
he'd never leave her

34:13.285 --> 34:14.653
for another woman.

34:14.686 --> 34:17.189
A jury's never gonna let her
get away with murder.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.690
Oh, a jury's never gonna
hear this case.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.459
You come to plead her out?

34:20.492 --> 34:23.095
No, no.

34:23.129 --> 34:24.563
I came to give you this.

34:26.832 --> 34:30.269
Not guilty by reason
of mental disease or defect.

34:30.302 --> 34:32.304
Your client knew exactly
what she was doing.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.840
My client
is a very sick woman.

34:34.873 --> 34:37.276
And I think after
your doctor examines her,

34:37.309 --> 34:39.678
he will agree that she is
not competent to stand trial.

34:42.514 --> 34:45.251
How many times
have you been hospitalized?

34:45.284 --> 34:46.618
Too many to count.

34:46.652 --> 34:49.288
And what have you
been admitted for?

34:49.321 --> 34:52.224
This year?
Uh-huh.

34:52.258 --> 34:56.228
Pneumonia.
Uh, pyelonephritis.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.764
Septicemia.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.467
And meningitis.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.435
Wow.

35:03.469 --> 35:04.470
You look pretty healthy
for someone

35:04.503 --> 35:05.504
who's been so sick.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.739
Thank you.

35:07.773 --> 35:10.842
The paralysis weakens
my immune system.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.278
Makes the body
more susceptible

35:12.311 --> 35:14.280
to bacterial infections.

35:14.313 --> 35:17.383
Really?

35:17.416 --> 35:18.417
You know, some doctors
might think

35:18.450 --> 35:21.353
that you have Munchausen's.

35:21.387 --> 35:22.388
You know what that is?

35:22.421 --> 35:29.261
I'm not making myself sick.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.630
Who would ever wanna endure
what I've had to go through?

35:31.663 --> 35:35.734
Good question.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.503
You're beautiful,
you're rich.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.371
You have a great career.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.407
I think that
you crave attention so much

35:41.440 --> 35:42.841
that you made your husband
into your servant.

35:42.874 --> 35:45.711
My husband loves me.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.513
Your husband
had an affair.

35:50.382 --> 35:53.652
Vicky seduced him.

35:53.685 --> 35:57.423
That's why you hired Inman
to kill her.

35:57.456 --> 36:02.594
I haven't seen Inman
since the Silverhammer trial.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.396
He says that
you gave him a list

36:04.430 --> 36:06.432
of bacterial cultures
that you wanted him

36:06.465 --> 36:08.234
to steal.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.335
He is a liar.

36:09.368 --> 36:11.337
The list is in
your handwriting.

36:11.370 --> 36:14.406
He was in Special Ops.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.809
He has access to the
best forgers in the world.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.279
So you're saying
that Inman's persecuting you?

36:20.312 --> 36:22.348
He hates me.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.416
I lost the case and now
he's taking it out on me

36:24.450 --> 36:26.452
and my husband.

36:26.485 --> 36:27.919
If I wasn't stuck
in this chair,

36:27.953 --> 36:31.423
I would kill him myself.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.396
Nothing in my exam
of Tessa McKellen

36:37.429 --> 36:38.630
suggests that
she's incompetent

36:38.664 --> 36:39.665
to stand trial.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.433
She has no cognitive
impairment.

36:41.467 --> 36:42.734
She's responsive
to questions.

36:42.768 --> 36:44.836
And she clearly understands
the serious nature

36:44.870 --> 36:46.972
of the charges against her.

36:47.005 --> 36:49.841
But in your report,
you made a diagnosis

36:49.875 --> 36:52.878
of a factitious disorder,
Munchausen's.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.481
Doesn't that mean
that she's mentally ill?

36:55.514 --> 36:56.915
That means that she has
a psychiatric disorder.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.285
But that has no bearing
on her competence.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.686
Her Munchausen's doesn't
impede her ability

37:00.719 --> 37:02.521
to assist in
her own trial.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.422
(Walsh)
But wouldn't the
Munchausen's diagnosis

37:03.455 --> 37:06.325
itself make
a good defense?

37:06.358 --> 37:08.494
Tessa denies
that she has Munchausen's.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.961
She maintains that all
her illnesses

37:09.995 --> 37:11.963
were caused by
a weakened immune system.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.765
(Walsh)
In other words,
she can't admit,

37:13.799 --> 37:16.034
even to herself, that she's
made herself sick.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.803
(Huang)
That's right.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.838
(Walsh)
Despite overwhelming evidence

37:19.871 --> 37:22.508
that all her diseases
have been self-induced.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.444
Tessa's too invested
in assuming the sick role.

37:25.477 --> 37:27.946
She won't give up
the attention she gets.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.549
(Walsh)
So you're saying that Tessa
has a valid diagnosis

37:30.582 --> 37:31.983
of Munchausen's.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.952
Which would make
a valid defense.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.821
But she refuses
to use that defense.

37:35.854 --> 37:40.559
How can you say that she's
competent to stand trial?

37:40.592 --> 37:41.460
(Huang)
What I'm saying is...

37:45.797 --> 37:47.466
Get a medic!

37:47.499 --> 37:50.869
Emergency in Part 46.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.037
The seizure was
self-induced.

37:52.070 --> 37:54.005
Tessa McKellen intentionally
OD'd on insulin.

37:54.039 --> 37:55.307
Proving my point.

37:55.341 --> 37:57.343
She is not fit
to stand trial.

37:57.376 --> 37:59.545
Your Honor, she is
manipulating the court.

37:59.578 --> 38:00.946
She's faking illness
to get sympathy

38:00.979 --> 38:02.548
and dodge a life sentence.

38:02.581 --> 38:03.882
My client is sick,
your honor.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.551
She cannot stop.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.019
Whenever she's under stress,
she will make herself ill.

38:08.053 --> 38:09.488
Well, then, gee, why don't
we let her off

38:09.521 --> 38:10.689
before she injects herself
with HIV?

38:10.722 --> 38:13.692
Nobody is talking
about letting her off.

38:13.725 --> 38:17.028
But I'm concerned about
another incident like today.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.765
I don't think Mrs. McKellen
is fit to stand trial

38:19.798 --> 38:20.866
at the moment.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.934
She needs
psychiatric treatment.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.035
We agree, Your Honor.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.871
And we ask that
because of the rarity

38:25.904 --> 38:28.407
of this condition
and her paralysis,

38:28.440 --> 38:29.408
that she be given treatment
in a private hospital,

38:29.441 --> 38:31.577
which, of course,
my client will pay for.

38:31.610 --> 38:33.379
That sounds reasonable.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.746
And when she gets out,
who's she gonna kill next?

38:34.780 --> 38:36.715
That's enough, Counselor.

38:36.748 --> 38:38.950
My client will surrender
in the morning, Your Honor.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.353
Her bail is continued
and your request is granted.

38:41.387 --> 38:43.555
Your Honor,
don't fall for this.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.857
Don't question the ruling
of this court, Ms. Novak.

38:45.891 --> 38:48.594
If and when the defendant
is well enough to stand trial,

38:48.627 --> 38:50.629
she will.

38:50.662 --> 38:54.700
Until then, she will receive
the treatment she needs.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.034
I have a bulletproof case
against Tessa,

38:56.067 --> 38:57.235
but I can't put her on trial
so long as

38:57.268 --> 39:00.472
she's hanging out at some
cushy private mental hospital.

39:00.506 --> 39:01.440
At least she'll be
in some locked ward

39:01.473 --> 39:03.809
where she won't hurt herself
or anybody else.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.512
Yeah, but she belongs in prison
with her hit man buddy Inman.

39:06.545 --> 39:10.148
Is there any way
to change Petrovsky's mind?

39:10.181 --> 39:11.583
Show her that Tessa's
a manipulative

39:11.617 --> 39:13.485
calculating bitch
who planned this defense

39:13.519 --> 39:14.920
meticulously.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.722
Just like the murders.

39:16.755 --> 39:19.558
Maybe it's not the judge
we have to convince.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.160
Tessa is sick.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.695
She didn't know
what she was doing.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.564
She's getting away
with two murders.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.666
The court said
she's not responsible.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.736
Your wife is using her illness
to manipulate you.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.604
To make you think
that she's a victim.

39:32.638 --> 39:33.739
She is a victim.

39:33.772 --> 39:36.908
You have no idea
what it's like for her.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.944
Her neurologists say
she's in constant pain.

39:38.977 --> 39:41.513
Do they also say
that excuses her behavior?

39:41.547 --> 39:43.749
I don't know,
I haven't talked to them

39:43.782 --> 39:44.750
in a couple years.

39:44.783 --> 39:45.817
(Stabler)
Well, why not?

39:45.851 --> 39:46.852
You do everything else
for her.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.019
Why haven't you
talked to them?

39:48.053 --> 39:49.721
Tessa doesn't like me
to go with her.

39:49.755 --> 39:51.823
She says it reminds her
of the accident.

39:51.857 --> 39:55.527
So you have no idea
whether she's gotten better.

39:55.561 --> 39:58.697
She says she hasn't.

39:58.730 --> 39:59.631
If you haven't talked
to the doctors,

39:59.665 --> 40:01.867
how do you know that's true?

40:13.612 --> 40:17.048
Linus, what are they
doing here?

40:17.082 --> 40:18.049
Linus?

40:18.083 --> 40:20.586
Linus, what are
you doing?

40:20.619 --> 40:22.053
[Tessa screams]

40:32.731 --> 40:34.600
(Benson)
Look, it's a miracle.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.167
She can swim.

40:51.617 --> 40:53.719
And she can walk too.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.627
Linus.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.628
Let me explain.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.596
Don't.
Don't!

41:04.630 --> 41:06.565
All those years.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.600
I took care of you.

41:08.634 --> 41:11.136
I did everything for you
because I loved you.

41:11.169 --> 41:12.904
I'm sorry.
I love you.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.773
But I'm sick.
I need your help.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.577
You are sick.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.045
You're on your own.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.614
No, don't leave me.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.215
Don't leave me!

41:24.249 --> 41:26.785
No.

41:26.818 --> 41:31.222
What's gonna
happen to me now?

41:31.256 --> 41:33.659
Who's gonna
take care of me?

41:33.692 --> 41:36.595
The warden will.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.163
You'll never be alone
in prison.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.198
