[instrumental music]

01:42.202 --> 01:43.737
Cousin, you'll
never guess what!

01:44.805 --> 01:45.739
Oh!

01:47.774 --> 01:49.442
‐ Are you alright?
‐ I couldn't be better.

01:49.475 --> 01:51.311
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ I have great news.

01:51.344 --> 01:54.548
I signed us up for three days
and two fun‐filled nights

01:54.581 --> 01:56.750
at the Hidden
Mountain Ski Resort.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.719
We're going skiing!

01:58.752 --> 02:01.655
Skiing? What are
you talking about?

02:01.688 --> 02:03.857
That nice game where you
put sticks on your feet

02:03.890 --> 02:06.492
and slide down a mountain.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.562
Balki, I know
what skiing is.

02:08.595 --> 02:09.795
And I hate skiing.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.298
Oh, how do you know?
Have you ever tried it?

02:12.332 --> 02:13.534
Yes.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.502
Our family went
skiing every winter

02:15.536 --> 02:19.339
and every winter I spent
a week with my face in the snow.

02:19.372 --> 02:22.909
My brothers and sisters
would use me as a ski jump.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.711
I'm the only
Appleton who can't ski.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.580
Dad thinks it's a recessive
gene or something.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.850
But, cousin, you haven't
heard the best part yet.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.351
‐ Balki, Balki‐‐
‐ It‐it, let me‐‐

02:31.384 --> 02:32.819
You signed me up
for something

02:32.853 --> 02:34.821
without my permission,
didn't you?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.356
‐ Yes, I did, but‐but‐‐
‐ And you shouldn't have.

02:36.389 --> 02:37.658
Should you?
You shouldn't have.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.458
‐ You shouldn't have.
‐ Cousin, cousin, cousin‐‐

02:38.491 --> 02:39.259
You shouldn't
have signed me up.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.794
You shouldn't
have signed me up

02:40.827 --> 02:43.329
for something
without my permission.

02:43.363 --> 02:44.898
‐ No, I shouldn't have.
‐ Fine.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.234
I'm drained.

02:49.369 --> 02:50.704
[knocking on door]

02:50.737 --> 02:52.839
Nothing could get me up
on a pair of skis again.

02:52.873 --> 02:53.940
‐ But‐‐
‐ No matter what you do.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.842
‐ 'But‐‐'
‐ No matter what you say.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.745
No way are you getting
me up on that mountain.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.514
Hey, Larry, ready
to hit the slopes?

03:03.784 --> 03:05.552
Bad news, Jennifer.

03:05.586 --> 03:06.853
Cousin Larry and I
can't go skiing

03:06.887 --> 03:07.821
with you and Mary Anne.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.389
We can't?

03:09.422 --> 03:10.223
Oh, no, we
needed two more

03:10.256 --> 03:12.492
to get a group rate.
Why can't you go?

03:12.526 --> 03:15.729
Because Cousin Larry
have a recess in his jeans.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.464
Uh, no, no, no, Balki, uh,
uh, what I, what I said was

03:18.498 --> 03:20.534
I had to reassess my means.

03:20.567 --> 03:21.334
[chuckles]

03:21.367 --> 03:23.670
Oh, and great news,
I can afford it.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.405
Oh, good,
because I need your check

03:25.438 --> 03:26.973
for the deposit.
It's $45.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.609
Forty five dollars.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.776
Well, that's
cheap when you're

03:29.810 --> 03:32.478
used to skiing at
Aspen or...the Alps.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.316
But, cousin, you told
me you hate skiing!

03:36.349 --> 03:38.852
Alone, I hate
skiing alone.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.886
Going down the face
of a mountain

03:39.920 --> 03:41.722
where no man
has skied before.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.490
I want somebody
to share it with.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.459
Well, there
will be 20 of us!

03:48.962 --> 03:50.931
Cousin Larry used
to be a ski jump.

03:50.964 --> 03:51.898
Er.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.035
Ski jumper, yeah.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.136
Used to be a ski jumper.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.972
Uh, but this trip, we'll all
keep our skis on the snow.

03:59.005 --> 04:01.007
[laughing]

04:01.041 --> 04:02.709
Oh, oh, ha ha ha..

04:04.511 --> 04:05.478
‐ Terrific.
‐ Yeah.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.479
‐ See you Friday.
‐ Yeah.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.749
‐ Bye, Balki.
‐ Hey, see you on the slopes.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.416
[laughs]

04:12.318 --> 04:13.620
'Me and Jennifer..'

04:13.654 --> 04:15.589
...long talks by the fire.

04:15.622 --> 04:18.391
Jacuzzi...moonlight.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.959
I wish I had time
to grow a beard.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.564
‐ Sipping brandy..
‐ Observation.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.430
Yes.

04:24.464 --> 04:27.968
‐ A man says he hates skiing.
‐ Yes.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.470
A woman he yearns
for walks into the room

04:30.504 --> 04:33.439
and suddenly that same
man is skiing the Alps.

04:38.545 --> 04:40.514
Now, uh, cousin,
konk me on the head

04:40.547 --> 04:42.482
with an anvil
if I'm wrong..

04:44.851 --> 04:46.953
...but didn't you just tell
one lallopalooza of a lie?

04:46.987 --> 04:48.755
Not at all.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.457
You told me
you hate skiing!

04:51.491 --> 04:53.426
Balki, there's
a difference between skiing

04:53.459 --> 04:55.962
and skiing with Jennifer.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.598
One of them is a sport.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.365
The other is something
worth dying for.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.504
So, technically
I wasn't lying.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.938
Well, in Mypos
we have a saying.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.708
[speaking in Myposian]

05:13.914 --> 05:15.649
‐ Do you want me to translate?
‐ Not really, no.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.886
It says, "He who lies

05:19.920 --> 05:22.656
falls into a deep pit."

05:25.592 --> 05:27.728
In America
we have a saying.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.329
"Butt out."

05:31.865 --> 05:35.401
Candlelit dinners,
romantic music.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.437
Maybe I should bring
my Julio Iglesias tapes.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.642
[instrumental music]

05:44.711 --> 05:46.680
How do those boots feel?

05:46.713 --> 05:49.415
Well, ooh..

05:49.449 --> 05:51.351
...kinda make you
walk like Lee Majors.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.393
How do I look?

06:01.662 --> 06:03.764
Like six million bucks.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.666
Okay, now, I got us a book

06:05.699 --> 06:07.433
that will teach us
everything we need to know.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.804
‐ Have you seen the book?
‐ Well, I think so.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.841
‐ Ah, here it is.
‐ Oh, where?

06:16.476 --> 06:18.078
Uh, careful.

06:20.080 --> 06:20.814
[clears throat]

06:23.483 --> 06:25.018
‐ Maybe I'll just put them down.
‐ Yes.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.453
[thud]

06:29.189 --> 06:31.491
I'll put them down,
you move the table

06:31.525 --> 06:32.893
over there.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.396
Boy, you know, these
boots are killing me.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.601
Is that what they mean by
"The agony of the feet?"

06:46.873 --> 06:47.608
[laughs]

06:50.476 --> 06:53.446
"The Zen Book Of Skiing.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.448
Achieving Oneness
with the Snow."

06:58.118 --> 07:00.621
‐ "Oneness?"
‐ Oneness.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.524
This book will teach you
to think like an expert skier.

07:06.059 --> 07:08.795
"Chapter one,
putting on your skis."

07:11.532 --> 07:13.967
Well, I can
get us that far.

07:14.000 --> 07:14.735
Here.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.505
It's easy, just step in.

07:18.539 --> 07:21.241
Toe in, heel down.

07:21.274 --> 07:25.045
Toe in...in.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.547
‐ Heel down.
‐ Yeah.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.015
Toe in, heel down.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.217
Toe in, heel down.

07:33.019 --> 07:35.756
Boy..

07:35.789 --> 07:37.691
...these little
babies really lock on.

07:37.724 --> 07:40.026
‐ Hmm.
‐ Uh, how you get them off?

07:41.695 --> 07:43.664
Well, usually I fall
and they pop right off.

07:47.033 --> 07:49.536
Alright, now, let me,
let me get the book.

07:49.570 --> 07:50.671
‐ Just..
‐ Yeah, yeah.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.739
No, look out,
you're on my..

07:52.773 --> 07:55.676
No, Balki, I,
I, alright, no.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.043
‐ Balki, look, back up.
‐ Well, I‐‐

07:57.077 --> 07:59.112
Back up, back up,
Balki, back up.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.213
[creaking]

08:04.284 --> 08:06.219
‐ You alright?
‐ Think so.

08:06.252 --> 08:07.187
Alright.

08:09.255 --> 08:09.990
[creaking]

08:21.134 --> 08:22.669
Don't do that.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.305
‐ Alright. Back up.
‐ Maybe I..

08:25.338 --> 08:26.272
[creaking]

08:28.141 --> 08:30.544
[creaking]

08:54.334 --> 08:56.970
‐ Balki, Balki, let go.
‐ You, let go.

08:57.003 --> 08:57.904
‐ You, let go first.
‐ No, you, let go.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.774
Alright, Balki...
on the count of three

09:00.807 --> 09:01.975
we'll both let go. Ready?

09:02.008 --> 09:03.877
(both)
One, two, three.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.317
Alright, on the count of three
we'll really let go. Ready?

09:11.351 --> 09:13.086
(both)
One, two, three.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.259
Alright, alright, move your,
move your right foot.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.261
Pick up, pick up your right
foot, put it over there.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.831
Alright, move your left
foot, put it over there.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.868
Alright, s‐straighten out,
straighten out.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.270
[sighs]
Alright, now
let's get the book.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.882
Any idea how we
can get over there?

09:43.216 --> 09:45.886
Ah, yes.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.622
Uh, you take your downhill ski,
or is it your uphill ski?

09:48.655 --> 09:50.190
No, you take
your downhill ski

09:50.223 --> 09:53.059
and you put it over
your uphill ski

09:53.093 --> 09:56.229
like that. Okay? Yeah.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.198
I remember this move
because my brothers and sisters

09:58.231 --> 09:59.633
used to use it
to step over me.

09:59.666 --> 10:00.601
[chuckles]

10:02.035 --> 10:03.970
[breathing heavily]

10:04.004 --> 10:06.139
Cousin, do‐do
you really think

10:06.172 --> 10:08.809
you can be an expert skier
by tomorrow afternoon?

10:09.810 --> 10:11.678
Well, I'm going to try.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.180
Now, you just take your uphill
ski, put it over the other one

10:14.214 --> 10:16.216
and you're home free.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.083
‐ Oh!
‐ Oh!

10:21.121 --> 10:24.290
Alright, alright,
Balki, you're right.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.159
Who was I trying to kid.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.861
I can't even ski
in my own living room.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.964
This isn't going to work.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.767
But, cousin, I'm sorry
to say this, but I'm glad.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.835
Now, you can make
a new beginning

10:34.868 --> 10:37.003
and tell
Jennifer the truth.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.005
The truth? The truth?

10:39.039 --> 10:41.274
Who said anything
about the truth?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.109
I just need a better plan.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.845
[grunting]

10:44.878 --> 10:45.979
[Larry panting]

10:46.012 --> 10:48.148
You say plan,
but you mean lies.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.751
How about this?

10:53.419 --> 10:55.088
As soon as we get
up there, I'll insist

10:55.121 --> 10:57.323
we go for one run
before the lifts close.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.193
Then after about a 100 yards,
I'll fall in a soft spot

11:00.226 --> 11:01.862
fake an injury and spend
the rest of the weekend

11:01.895 --> 11:03.463
getting sympathy from Jennifer.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.998
Listen to yourself.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.800
You want to tell one more lie

11:06.833 --> 11:08.101
to cover up another.

11:08.134 --> 11:10.270
It's like a snowball
rolling down a hill.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.872
By the time it get to the bottom

11:11.905 --> 11:13.940
it's one humongous
snowball of lies!

11:16.276 --> 11:17.143
What happened to the pit?

11:17.177 --> 11:19.045
Where do you think
the snowball lands?

11:20.480 --> 11:21.214
Now..

11:23.283 --> 11:25.118
...you think
everything is so simple.

11:25.151 --> 11:26.920
You think everything
is black and white.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.089
Well, it's not.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.457
There is a lot of grey
in this world. A lot.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.194
I'm not lying.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.195
I'm simply..

11:35.228 --> 11:37.964
...reshaping the facts
into a greater truth.

11:37.998 --> 11:40.266
Cousin, why you
have to do that?

11:40.300 --> 11:42.068
Why you have to
reshape the facts?

11:43.336 --> 11:45.138
Why can't you just
be Larry Appleton?

11:45.171 --> 11:47.173
Balki, where have you been?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.776
I have been Larry Appleton
for the past six months

11:49.810 --> 11:51.978
and Jennifer isn't
interested in him.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.880
That's because she
never sees him.

11:55.882 --> 11:57.851
After she's blinded by love

11:57.884 --> 12:00.386
then I will show her
the real Larry Appleton.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.088
But tomorrow, all
Jennifer is going to see

12:02.122 --> 12:04.257
is Larry Appleton
downhill racer.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.025
Oh..

12:06.392 --> 12:07.528
[grunts]

12:07.561 --> 12:10.496
[instrumental music]

12:29.550 --> 12:31.885
[panting]

12:31.918 --> 12:33.554
That ski lift was fun.

12:33.587 --> 12:34.821
‐ Wasn't it?
‐ Yeah.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.423
‐ Wasn't it fun?
‐ Yeah, terrific.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.860
You don't think anybody saw
me fall when I got off, do you?

12:41.361 --> 12:43.797
Well, of course not.
Don't be ridiculous.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.967
Those people were laughing
about something else.

12:47.000 --> 12:47.934
Now..

12:49.603 --> 12:51.538
...I‐I'm sorry about
skiing over your hand.

12:51.572 --> 12:53.173
Uh, oh, don't
worry about it.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.275
I'm used to it.

12:55.308 --> 12:57.844
Alright, now
there's a good spot.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.245
(Larry)
'I'll look good for about
a 100 yards, then fall'

12:59.279 --> 13:02.916
in that soft pile of
snow and fake an injury.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.085
The pit deepens.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.823
Alright, here come
the girls. Try to look cool.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.831
What are you guys
doin' over here?

13:17.864 --> 13:19.800
Trying to look cool.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.204
I'm just a sucker
for fresh powder.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.173
But the run is over there,
this side isn't even marked.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.175
‐ Oh.
‐ Looks too steep for me.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.545
Come on, take
a bite outta life.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.047
No guts, no glory.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.550
Ye‐e‐eah!

13:36.583 --> 13:39.319
[Larry screaming]

13:42.055 --> 13:45.158
Cousin, I think you
missed your soft spot!

13:45.191 --> 13:47.260
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, ho, ho!

13:47.293 --> 13:49.429
Help! Help!

13:49.462 --> 13:52.298
[screaming]

13:52.332 --> 13:54.134
Boy, he really likes
to show off, doesn't he?

13:55.468 --> 13:57.538
No, he's screaming for help.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.640
Help! Oh, no! Oh, no!

13:59.673 --> 14:00.974
[Larry screaming]

14:01.007 --> 14:02.408
No, no!

14:02.442 --> 14:05.245
[screaming]

14:10.150 --> 14:11.918
[grunts]

14:11.952 --> 14:14.087
Hang on, Larry, we're coming!

14:14.120 --> 14:16.422
‐ Here we come!
‐ Wait for me. Wait.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.391
We're on our way, Larr.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.560
Hang on.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.061
Wait, you wait.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.664
Whoo, oh..

14:23.697 --> 14:26.432
[indistinct mumbling]

14:26.466 --> 14:28.401
Whoo! Oh! Oh, baby.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.538
I'm skiing!

14:31.572 --> 14:33.073
Whoo!

14:33.106 --> 14:36.042
[screaming]

14:37.277 --> 14:40.380
Cousin, are we
having fun...or what?

14:45.552 --> 14:48.221
[instrumental music]

14:56.530 --> 14:58.498
Yoo‐hoo! Anybody home?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.201
Oh, thank God.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.335
We finally found a place

15:02.368 --> 15:04.304
to get in out of the cold.

15:05.471 --> 15:08.642
Well, let's rest here
for a couple of minutes.

15:12.613 --> 15:15.448
And then we'll make
our way down the hill

15:15.481 --> 15:17.651
and see if we can
find the highway.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.186
We've been walking for
two hours, I'm exhausted.

15:21.487 --> 15:24.625
Well, I'll say one thing for us.

15:24.658 --> 15:27.160
I think we all achieved
oneness with the snow.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.332
And you, you achieved
oneness with that tree, huh?

15:34.635 --> 15:36.703
Do I have any more pine needles
sticking out of my forehead?

15:38.672 --> 15:39.540
No.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.009
Now I know what it feels
like to have acupuncture

15:43.043 --> 15:45.345
at 60 miles per hour.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.380
Oh, poor thing.
Sit down.

15:47.413 --> 15:48.649
You must be
really shaken up.

15:48.682 --> 15:51.985
No, I'm fine.
Uh, except for my ankle.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.021
I think I twisted it.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.190
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

15:57.223 --> 15:59.059
Well, it's getting dark.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.127
I think we better
stay here for the night.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.696
I‐I don't think I can
walk on this ankle.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.635
Hey, look, I found a blanket
and a bottle of wine.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.471
You two get out
of your wet coats.

16:11.505 --> 16:13.339
I saw some firewood outside.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.474
Come on, Mary Anne.

16:14.508 --> 16:16.209
Well, I'll open that.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.613
[door creaks open]

16:27.487 --> 16:30.390
Well, well, well.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.227
Mr. Liar‐Liar‐Pants‐On‐Fire.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.766
‐ I hope you're happy.
‐ Yes, very happy.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.704
How can you say that?

16:43.737 --> 16:46.206
We slide down the wrong
side of the mountain

16:46.239 --> 16:47.808
wander around for two hours

16:47.841 --> 16:51.311
bodies all aching
and racked with pain..

16:51.344 --> 16:52.513
...and now, we're
stuck in this cabin

16:52.546 --> 16:54.347
with the girls
for the whole night.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.188
You don't have
to thank me now.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.227
Looks like fate has put us
right where we wanted to be.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.395
Cousin, no! Not faith.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.565
It's your lies
that put us here.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.599
Fate, lies, what's
the difference?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.403
My plan is working.

17:17.436 --> 17:19.105
Cousin, don't you
see what's happening?

17:19.138 --> 17:22.208
Ever since you told a lie
things have been going wrong.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.377
"Going wrong?"
Balki, look around.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.614
I have wine,
a beautiful woman

17:27.647 --> 17:29.482
a mountain cabin.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.384
I guess this puts
an end once and for all

17:31.417 --> 17:33.654
to the great
Myposian pit theory.

17:35.689 --> 17:38.224
Well, maybe things
look good now

17:38.258 --> 17:40.126
but you mark my words

17:40.160 --> 17:42.663
it ain't over 'til
the fat lady eats.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.839
[instrumental music]

17:56.342 --> 17:58.444
It was the Giant Slalom
Finals at Innsbruck.

18:01.615 --> 18:04.785
It came down to a duel
between Ingmar...and myself.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.756
We stared across at each
other with a fierce respect

18:09.790 --> 18:11.625
born out of years
of intense competition.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.226
It's getting deeper..

18:15.428 --> 18:16.797
...and deeper.

18:18.599 --> 18:20.133
Anyway, by the first turn

18:20.166 --> 18:21.535
I was already
a split second ahead

18:21.568 --> 18:24.404
but then fate stepped in.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.840
A few meters in front
of me, frozen in fear

18:26.873 --> 18:28.842
was a snowshoe rabbit.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.711
Poor little rabbit.
What did you do?

18:30.744 --> 18:32.646
Well, I lost the race.

18:33.514 --> 18:34.648
How tragic.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.885
Not really.

18:38.919 --> 18:41.221
I grew up a lot on
the mountain that day.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.527
You see, I could have
skied right through

18:46.560 --> 18:48.795
that furry little creature..

18:48.829 --> 18:50.664
...but I learned that
there are a lot of things

18:50.697 --> 18:52.566
more important than winning.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.535
Is the truth one of them?

18:57.804 --> 18:59.773
Anyway, my racing
days are in the past.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.876
I like to live
in the present.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.678
There's so much I
don't know about you.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.847
Hmm, you can say that
again, and that reminds me..

19:08.982 --> 19:11.217
...I have a story.
It's called..

19:11.251 --> 19:13.419
[speaking in Myposian]

19:16.389 --> 19:17.323
What does that mean?

19:17.357 --> 19:20.326
It means the little
goat herder who lied.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.731
Well, I think the girls
are a little tired of stories.

19:24.765 --> 19:26.366
Not at all.
Go ahead, Balki.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.934
Once upon a time..

19:29.503 --> 19:31.437
...there was
a little goat herder

19:31.471 --> 19:34.340
and he had curly brown hair

19:34.374 --> 19:37.878
and, uh...little
round cheeks..

19:37.911 --> 19:39.813
...and, uh, no
upper lip at all.

19:43.449 --> 19:44.685
Balki.

19:44.718 --> 19:46.920
It came to pass
that the king

19:46.953 --> 19:48.722
announced a royal yak hunt.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.892
Well, that was a wonderful

19:51.925 --> 19:53.560
little folktale.
More wine, anyone?

19:53.594 --> 19:55.796
It was the day of the hunt

19:55.829 --> 19:57.330
and the little goat herder

19:57.363 --> 19:59.332
decided to show off
for the fair maiden.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.402
So he shot
an arrow into the air..

20:02.435 --> 20:04.871
...and where it landed...
he didn't care.

20:06.472 --> 20:09.810
But he should have,
because it hit the king

20:09.843 --> 20:11.878
right smack in
the royal buttocks.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.450
And they all lived
happily ever after?

20:17.483 --> 20:19.485
The king was
exceeding angry

20:19.520 --> 20:22.823
and he threw the little
goat herder into a dungeon.

20:22.856 --> 20:25.358
A dungeon not unlike a pit.

20:28.929 --> 20:30.931
I think I saw that on TV.

20:33.534 --> 20:35.736
Wasn't Richard Chamberlain
the little goat herder?

20:41.007 --> 20:43.510
Ah, those Mypos tales.

20:43.544 --> 20:45.278
Who knows what they mean?

20:45.311 --> 20:46.379
And who cares?

20:48.014 --> 20:49.950
‐ Well, this is the last log.
‐ Hmm.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.621
Well, you know, the best
way to fight off the cold

20:54.655 --> 20:57.490
is with, uh, body heat.

20:57.524 --> 20:58.892
That's a great
last resort

20:58.925 --> 21:00.861
but we have a fire.

21:00.894 --> 21:01.562
Uh, I'll just get
some more wood.

21:01.595 --> 21:03.964
Oh, no, no, no,
you stay here.

21:03.997 --> 21:06.600
I'll go get it.
Uh. That's a man's job.

21:09.503 --> 21:10.504
How's that ankle?

21:10.537 --> 21:13.339
Oh, huh. Well, comes and goes.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.775
Changes legs too.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.080
Are you sure you
don't need any help?

21:20.113 --> 21:22.649
Oh, no, no, I'll just go
rustle up some firewood.

21:22.683 --> 21:25.418
[chuckles]
Love to breath that
fresh mountain air.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.419
[chuckles]

21:26.452 --> 21:27.420
[wind whooshing]

21:27.453 --> 21:28.488
[breathes heavily]

21:28.522 --> 21:29.656
[coughing]

21:31.558 --> 21:33.393
Good Lord, it's cold out here.

21:35.829 --> 21:36.930
I'm getting hungry.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.899
I wonder if
there's any food.

21:42.903 --> 21:45.939
I'm really sorry that
we ruined your ski trip.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.374
Oh, that's okay,
I'm having fun.

21:49.610 --> 21:51.712
But a little body
heat would be nice.

21:56.550 --> 21:59.520
Well, it's a good thing
I brought my body.

22:06.092 --> 22:09.029
[rumbling]

22:16.102 --> 22:17.437
Wow!

22:20.907 --> 22:22.776
‐ Did you feel that?
‐ Well, of course, I did.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.845
Don't be ridiculous.

22:27.681 --> 22:29.683
I still respect you.

22:32.152 --> 22:34.120
I think we just
had an earthquake.

22:34.154 --> 22:35.989
They don't have
earthquakes in Wisconsin.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.490
It was probably
just an avalanche.

22:37.524 --> 22:38.058
Hmm.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.661
[all shouting]
Avalanche!

22:40.694 --> 22:42.062
Cousin Larry!

23:08.622 --> 23:10.123
I found the wood.

23:18.498 --> 23:19.800
Get him to the couch.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.569
[indistinct mumbling]

23:23.570 --> 23:26.507
[groaning]

23:27.741 --> 23:30.176
Oh, Larry, are you okay?

23:30.210 --> 23:32.946
I was outside.
I was happy.

23:34.648 --> 23:36.617
I found the perfect log.

23:36.650 --> 23:38.685
And suddenly I heard
this...this‐this..

23:38.719 --> 23:40.554
‐ Rumbling?
‐ Yes, this rumbling.

23:40.587 --> 23:43.824
And I turned around
and saw this big, this big..

23:43.857 --> 23:46.627
‐ Mountain?
‐ Yes, mountain!

23:46.660 --> 23:49.763
The mountain started chasing
me towards the‐the‐the..

23:49.796 --> 23:50.931
Pit?

23:56.202 --> 23:58.972
No, not the pit.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.241
Where we are now,
the cabin!

24:01.274 --> 24:03.143
I never saw so much snow!

24:03.176 --> 24:05.145
There was enough snow
to cover this entire..

24:08.081 --> 24:11.017
[panting]

24:22.729 --> 24:24.898
[whimpering]

24:24.931 --> 24:27.934
Oh, cousin,
we're buried alive.

24:27.968 --> 24:29.970
Not for long.

24:30.003 --> 24:31.171
Very soon
we'll all be dead.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.041
[intense music]

24:41.815 --> 24:44.551
[theme music]

25:06.707 --> 25:09.242
[music continues]
