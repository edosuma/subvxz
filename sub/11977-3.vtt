WEBVTT

00:06.308 --> 00:07.942
Previously on Rogue...

00:07.976 --> 00:09.010
Talk to me, Travis

00:13.282 --> 00:15.317
They've had me chained up in
a basement for three fucking days.

00:15.350 --> 00:16.818
I thought I was dead, Sarah.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.653
And Kelly is my best shot.

00:18.687 --> 00:19.754
All right,
I got into the database.

00:19.788 --> 00:21.523
Guess who propped up.

00:21.556 --> 00:24.259
Ethan Kelly. He was picked up for a
B & E in Chicago a few days ago.

00:24.293 --> 00:25.694
No charges were filed.

00:26.995 --> 00:28.597
Last chance, Fanelli.
Is she in Chicago?

00:28.630 --> 00:30.098
I think so.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.793
Grace Travis
is heading your way.

00:32.901 --> 00:34.469
Well, you want me to ask
around who the white guy was?

00:34.503 --> 00:36.805
That's the general idea, Lobo.

00:36.838 --> 00:38.540
Get me a name. Find out
what he was doing there.

00:38.573 --> 00:40.809
I'm watching you. Understood?

00:40.842 --> 00:42.511
I know you stole a file
from the Stein firm

00:42.544 --> 00:44.313
and gave it to Adam Hutchings.

00:44.346 --> 00:46.014
Some drunk black chick Talia.

00:46.047 --> 00:48.116
She's all pissed off
'cause Stein closed her salon.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.018
I poured everything
into that place,

00:50.051 --> 00:52.721
and you just let Big
Master Marty take it away.

00:52.754 --> 00:55.521
Saying I know enough about his
business to ruin his white ass.

00:57.058 --> 01:00.128
The guy who shot Darius
also shot a judge's son.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.830
We want the shooter, Cups.
Alive.

01:01.863 --> 01:03.164
I can do that for you.

01:03.198 --> 01:05.300
Kill the motherfuckers
that killed Dee.

01:05.334 --> 01:07.688
Kill all the motherfuckers
you have to.

02:06.060 --> 02:07.711
This was three weeks ago.

02:07.746 --> 02:09.315
You need to relax.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.466
This doesn't concern you?

02:11.500 --> 02:13.602
Yeah, sure it does,
but times are changing, Deak.

02:13.635 --> 02:15.304
There's no privacy anymore.

02:15.337 --> 02:17.272
Hutchings was a reporter,
chasing a story.

02:17.306 --> 02:18.807
This is what they do.

02:18.840 --> 02:20.642
Oh, this is what they do,
that's great.

02:20.675 --> 02:22.311
There's nothing newsworthy
about us.

02:22.344 --> 02:24.145
How're you gonna do
a story about Chicago gangs

02:24.178 --> 02:25.880
without looking at the people who
fuck up their world on the regular?

02:25.914 --> 02:27.282
What worlds are we fucking up?

02:27.316 --> 02:29.951
What about Cups
coming to us the other night?

02:29.984 --> 02:32.421
Tail so far between his legs, I
thought he was sprouting wood.

02:32.454 --> 02:34.055
He still hasn't delivered
the shooter.

02:34.088 --> 02:36.791
The point is, he came.
And do you know why he came?

02:36.825 --> 02:37.959
- Fear.
- Fear, huh?

02:37.992 --> 02:39.227
Hell yeah.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.264
Fear that we put in him
day in, day out.

02:42.299 --> 02:43.932
You're a real terror, Patty.

02:43.965 --> 02:45.099
You know why reporters
are snapping our picture?

02:45.133 --> 02:46.968
'Cause we are the real story.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.303
We're goddamn celebrities
in this town.

02:48.337 --> 02:49.604
- Oh, we're celebrities now?
- Yeah!

02:49.638 --> 02:51.139
I'm John Wayne.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.185
You're the pretty Indian girl
fucking John Wayne.

02:53.442 --> 02:55.410
Look, all I'm saying is

02:55.444 --> 02:58.638
what we do here,
it is important!

02:59.481 --> 03:01.015
'Bout time
the world figured it out.

03:01.049 --> 03:02.150
Okay, what about
the rest of these?

03:04.653 --> 03:06.521
What is that?

03:06.555 --> 03:08.618
- It's urban art.
- No, what is that?

03:10.291 --> 03:11.626
That.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.530
Is that something on the lens?

03:17.198 --> 03:19.294
- Who's Mata Hari?
- Lobo.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.505
You need to cut that kid loose.

03:23.972 --> 03:24.873
What?

03:26.307 --> 03:28.677
Mmm-hmm.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.472
You bet your freedom
on it, huh?

03:31.245 --> 03:32.714
Well, that's good.
'Cause that's what at stake.

03:36.685 --> 03:37.819
Yeah, we'll be there.

03:40.589 --> 03:43.057
- You never learn, do you?
- Never know, either.

03:43.091 --> 03:45.159
He says he's got something
for us tonight.

03:45.193 --> 03:46.828
Right now, I'm gonna see
what Cups was shopping for.

03:46.861 --> 03:49.030
Maybe a lamp?

03:49.063 --> 03:50.899
He doesn't seem like
the chandelier type.

03:50.932 --> 03:52.534
All right, I'm going to
hang back here,

03:52.567 --> 03:55.003
finish sorting through the stuff
we pulled out of Hutchings' car.

03:55.036 --> 03:56.371
- I'm gonna catch up with you later.
- All right.

04:01.009 --> 04:03.244
Where will we be
if we stop working?

04:05.079 --> 04:07.315
Walking through the slush,
that's where.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.151
And marching right down
to City Hall

04:10.184 --> 04:12.754
to bang on your door
to ask you why!

04:18.091 --> 04:19.560
Now, now, now!
Hold on a second.

04:19.594 --> 04:22.263
- Nobody wants a strike, right?
- No!

04:22.296 --> 04:24.232
We don't want to walk out, we
want to work, feed our families.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.568
Yeah!

04:26.601 --> 04:30.038
But when some
pencil pushing three piece

04:30.071 --> 04:33.508
steps on our dignity, stomps
on our dignity, crushing it

04:33.542 --> 04:36.745
under his $400 Florsheims,
I'm gonna tell you something,

04:36.778 --> 04:39.047
I will do whatever it takes...

04:39.080 --> 04:41.850
We will do whatever it takes

04:41.883 --> 04:43.585
to lift it back up

04:43.618 --> 04:45.787
where it belongs.
That's all I gotta say.

04:51.426 --> 04:53.361
Sick and tired of
this shit right now.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.429
- Nice speech, buddy.
- Nice speech, mate.

04:55.564 --> 04:56.631
I love you, I love you.

04:58.266 --> 05:00.301
You're a man of the people.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.803
I assume you found the leak.

05:01.836 --> 05:04.405
He's a bartender
from Edison's, his name's CC.

05:04.439 --> 05:06.074
He stole the file
while delivering sandwiches.

05:10.078 --> 05:12.914
Well... Well, I didn't expect
that one, I have to admit.

05:12.947 --> 05:14.315
Well, he and Hutchings
are old buddies.

05:14.983 --> 05:17.318
Damn.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.987
I guess a good bartender's
hard to find these days.

05:30.999 --> 05:33.101
- Marty, that was a great, fucking speech.
- Sit the fuck down.

05:33.134 --> 05:34.897
And shut the fuck up.

05:39.974 --> 05:42.847
You stupid fuckin' prick.

05:43.612 --> 05:46.515
How can you put the idea
of a 50 cent raise

05:46.548 --> 05:48.617
into these nickel brains?

05:48.650 --> 05:50.418
Look, we haven't had a raise...

05:50.451 --> 05:52.120
- Didn't I say shut the fuck up?
- Jesus... Fuck...

05:52.153 --> 05:53.849
Shut up!

05:55.456 --> 05:59.099
You infant! You fuckin' moron!

05:59.994 --> 06:02.196
This is how it's gonna play.

06:02.230 --> 06:05.534
You're going to wait two days

06:05.567 --> 06:07.435
and then you're going to tell
those meatheads out there

06:07.468 --> 06:10.038
that the Mayor says the 50
cents will bankrupt the city,

06:10.071 --> 06:11.873
which, in fact, it will do.

06:11.906 --> 06:13.441
And that you have personally
scrubbed the books

06:13.474 --> 06:15.176
to confirm that fact

06:15.209 --> 06:17.879
and that they're lucky the Mayor
doesn't demand givebacks.

06:17.912 --> 06:20.014
What the fuck, Marty?

06:20.048 --> 06:21.816
You are our lawyer, okay?
You work for us...

06:21.850 --> 06:23.284
- You are goddamn right.
- You don't work for the fuckin' Mayor.

06:23.317 --> 06:24.553
I am their lawyer

06:24.586 --> 06:26.521
and I don't want
my clients out of work,

06:26.555 --> 06:30.158
wondering where the fuck they're
going to get their next paycheck,

06:30.191 --> 06:31.860
how the fuck they're gonna
feed their families.

06:33.695 --> 06:35.340
You know what?

06:37.699 --> 06:39.776
Let's just keep this
simple, huh?

06:40.168 --> 06:41.922
Let's put it this way.

06:42.871 --> 06:47.010
If one truck, one,
misses one delivery,

06:47.542 --> 06:49.243
your wife is going to find out

06:49.277 --> 06:50.712
that your dick got sucked
by two skanks

06:50.745 --> 06:52.686
in Atlantic City last month.

06:55.049 --> 06:56.184
We understand each other?

06:58.119 --> 06:59.253
Say it out loud.

07:01.790 --> 07:03.798
I understand.

07:11.365 --> 07:13.835
The "man of the people" thing
is one hell of a hand job.

07:13.868 --> 07:16.104
Nothing like a nice hand job
every now and then.

07:16.137 --> 07:18.734
Now bring me
that fucking bartender.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.673
Hi.

07:30.919 --> 07:33.054
- How can I help you?
- Here on business.

07:33.087 --> 07:34.956
Mine, not yours, unfortunately.

07:34.989 --> 07:36.925
I see. What's this about?

07:36.958 --> 07:38.226
Do you recognize this man?

07:41.395 --> 07:42.263
Hmm.

07:46.635 --> 07:48.637
- No, I don't think so.
- You don't think so?

07:48.670 --> 07:51.873
I'm sorry, but we get a lot of
people coming in and out of here.

07:51.906 --> 07:54.976
His name is Eugene Harris,
sometimes goes by Cups.

07:55.009 --> 07:56.645
Well, I can check our records,
if you don't mind waiting.

07:56.678 --> 07:58.547
- That'd be great.
- Yeah.

08:05.920 --> 08:06.821
Harris...

08:09.858 --> 08:15.063
No. No Harris or Cups
in the system.

08:15.096 --> 08:15.830
Is this something
I should be worried about?

08:15.864 --> 08:17.298
Is this guy dangerous?

08:17.331 --> 08:19.459
Only if he has reason to be.

08:20.168 --> 08:21.135
How long have you been here?

08:21.169 --> 08:23.004
About 10 years now.

08:23.037 --> 08:25.974
How does one get into the
chandelier business exactly?

08:26.007 --> 08:28.576
The idea just came to me
one day, I suppose.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.419
Oh, like a light bulb moment?

08:31.713 --> 08:34.683
- We get a lot of mileage out of
that one around here. - I bet.

08:34.716 --> 08:35.817
If he comes back,
give me a call, all right?

08:35.850 --> 08:37.351
Of course. Look,

08:37.385 --> 08:40.058
I'll knock 40% off
that chandelier for you.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.192
What? Is that a bribe?

08:42.227 --> 08:44.215
No, it's a civil service
discount.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.942
Get the fuck out of here.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.344
What, a brother can't have some of
his own brother's fries? Come on.

09:03.377 --> 09:04.312
I don't know
where your hands have been.

09:04.345 --> 09:06.514
Where they've been?

09:06.547 --> 09:08.683
They been in Delilah's twat,
that's where they've been.

09:08.717 --> 09:11.552
- Taste that. Taste that.
- Mama wouldn't like you talkin' like that.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.988
Well, it's a good thing
Mama ain't around then, huh?

09:14.022 --> 09:16.516
What's wrong with you, man?

09:18.359 --> 09:20.848
Shit, I didn't mean it
like that, you know?

09:23.765 --> 09:25.472
I'm sorry.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.735
Sorry, Mama.

09:27.736 --> 09:29.410
Right?

09:30.772 --> 09:32.173
Now, did you sell
all that shit or what?

09:39.748 --> 09:42.316
Mean, little bro...

09:42.350 --> 09:44.485
- Ain't no thing.
- What do you mean, "Ain't no thing"?

09:44.518 --> 09:46.354
You Jay fuckin' Z up in this
motherfucker now, huh?

09:46.387 --> 09:48.256
Stop it, man.

09:55.096 --> 09:56.597
Yo.

09:58.299 --> 09:59.960
Ten.

10:01.770 --> 10:03.772
Cups is callin' us in.
Finish your fuckin' fries.

10:05.473 --> 10:07.608
You got a couple off the floor
too there, homie.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.710
- Move it, Lobo.
- Yeah, man, let's book it.

10:09.744 --> 10:11.935
- Move your ass!
- Yeah.

10:16.550 --> 10:17.318
Mmm.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.621
Mmm.

10:22.490 --> 10:24.092
I got to tinkle.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.025
Gotta go. Gotta go.

10:39.607 --> 10:42.589
Mmm.

10:43.411 --> 10:45.213
That smells good.

10:45.246 --> 10:46.314
You don't got to tell me
it smell good,

10:46.347 --> 10:49.083
I know it smell good.

10:49.117 --> 10:50.952
That's the true shit
right here.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.887
Homemade.

10:52.921 --> 10:56.090
Yeah, whatever...
You know me.

10:56.124 --> 10:58.292
Oh, I'm sure Leo probably
spilled you all about it.

11:00.528 --> 11:02.964
- He didn't tell me anything. Promise.
- Mmm.

11:02.997 --> 11:05.299
- He didn't tell you 'bout our business?
- Nah.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.534
'Cause we're looking
for investors.

11:10.138 --> 11:12.399
Investors?

11:13.107 --> 11:14.042
Give me your hand.

11:21.282 --> 11:24.352
Tell me that ain't the
best shit you've ever felt.

11:24.385 --> 11:25.553
- Fuck yeah, it is.
- Fuck yeah, it is.

11:26.454 --> 11:28.422
It's got coconut...

11:28.456 --> 11:31.292
Some natural shit...

11:31.325 --> 11:33.161
Leo's boy cooked it up for us.

11:33.194 --> 11:35.796
Sweet. So where do you buy it?

11:35.831 --> 11:38.281
You can't. Not yet.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.534
We're gonna get
a bank loan, you know,

11:40.568 --> 11:42.837
make this shit for real.

11:42.871 --> 11:44.939
I'm gonna get
another salon soon.

11:44.973 --> 11:48.510
I could sell that shit like
fucking hot cakes to my clients.

11:48.545 --> 11:49.677
Fuck yeah.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.145
- Fuck yeah.
- Fuck yeah!

11:51.179 --> 11:52.280
Fuck yeah!

11:52.313 --> 11:53.882
Fuck yeah.

11:53.915 --> 11:55.016
'Cause you could sell that,
we could sell that shit

11:55.049 --> 11:57.151
in Kohls, fuckin' Macy's,

11:57.185 --> 12:00.488
all those places for real.
Shit!

12:00.521 --> 12:02.690
Oprah would be giving this
shit out for free on her show.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.325
Oprah ain't giving out
no freebies.

12:04.358 --> 12:06.394
She ain't even on TV no more.

12:06.427 --> 12:08.029
- Why you ain't tell me about this shit?
- What?

12:08.062 --> 12:10.064
Oh, that shit, yeah, yeah.

12:10.098 --> 12:11.232
I was gonna tell...
I was gonna tell you about it,

12:11.265 --> 12:13.579
but, you know, it's just...

12:14.435 --> 12:15.904
We're tryin' to do...
We're trying' to do this up big...

12:15.937 --> 12:17.972
For real, like, legit.

12:18.006 --> 12:19.540
Look, the start-up's
ain't cheap.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.009
You know, partnership's...
It's expensive.

12:21.042 --> 12:22.710
How expensive?

12:22.743 --> 12:25.013
I don't know, like, 30...

12:25.046 --> 12:26.680
- Thirty.
- Thirty grand?

12:26.714 --> 12:28.535
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's it?

12:28.570 --> 12:30.120
I can get that shit easy.

12:31.119 --> 12:32.386
What do you mean?

12:32.420 --> 12:34.488
Get 30 grand fucking easy.

12:34.522 --> 12:36.457
You fuckin'...

12:38.192 --> 12:39.360
- Are you serious?
- Fuckin' serious.

12:39.393 --> 12:41.429
Fuck yeah. Fuck yeah.

12:41.462 --> 12:42.363
I guess we're
celebrating now, hmm?

12:54.808 --> 12:55.876
Y'all check the back.

12:57.045 --> 12:58.947
Look's good, Cups.

12:58.980 --> 13:01.249
We're moving
the 10th Street stash.

13:01.282 --> 13:03.669
Marvin and Audell gonna come
through with the vans at 8:00.

13:03.751 --> 13:05.286
Where're we goin'?

13:05.319 --> 13:07.355
Some blue piece of shit
up on the 16th.

13:07.388 --> 13:08.856
I'm gonna check it out
personal at midnight.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.192
- Y'all keep your eyes until I get there.
- A'ight.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.127
Look, this is some
sensitive ass shit, all right?

13:13.161 --> 13:15.688
You feel me?
So keep your eyes wide.

13:16.330 --> 13:18.132
Look, the cops have been up
on our shit for a while now.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.567
So if this motherfucker
don't smell good,

13:19.600 --> 13:21.869
you make sure you walk away.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.304
- Yeah, I feel that.
- All right.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.777
Let's bounce.

13:34.015 --> 13:35.649
Just have a drink.
Just relax, man.

13:35.683 --> 13:38.953
- He's gonna kill me.
- No. Listen, CC...

13:38.987 --> 13:40.788
He's a lawyer, okay?
He's not going to kill you.

13:41.455 --> 13:42.991
Hey.

13:43.024 --> 13:44.925
As long as what you
told me is the truth,

13:44.959 --> 13:47.431
you'll be fine. I promise.

13:48.096 --> 13:49.845
You think?

13:49.863 --> 13:51.854
Yeah, probably.

13:53.034 --> 13:54.568
Thanks.

13:54.602 --> 13:55.803
Let's go. Come on.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.205
Get your stuff. Let's go.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.140
I'm gonna lose my job
though, aren't I?

14:00.174 --> 14:01.642
Listen, just keep it simple.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.444
You were helping out a friend.
Period.

14:03.477 --> 14:05.913
- I was. - And I might leave out
that thing about Talia.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.946
Wait a minute, why?

14:10.818 --> 14:12.686
Look, you can say
whatever you want,

14:12.720 --> 14:13.987
but if it was me, I would
want it over real quick.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.190
You understand?

14:16.224 --> 14:18.359
You start bringing up other people
and it starts to feel like,

14:18.392 --> 14:20.961
you know, a conspiracy or something.
You follow me?

14:20.996 --> 14:22.089
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.748
- Yeah.
- Any sign of her?

14:47.020 --> 14:48.121
Nothing so far.

14:54.362 --> 14:56.597
I must've been like, 15, 16...

14:56.630 --> 14:58.832
The manager's got me working
the cash register, right?

14:58.866 --> 15:00.368
And this old black guy comes in

15:00.401 --> 15:03.237
wearing a Billy Williams
Cubs jersey.

15:03.271 --> 15:05.439
And of course, we all know
what a diehard Sox fan I am,

15:05.473 --> 15:07.207
so I let him have it.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.876
"We don't serve
your kind here."

15:08.909 --> 15:11.245
- You did not.
- I swear to God.

15:11.279 --> 15:15.048
I realized what I said as soon as
it fucking came out of my mouth.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.586
All my fucking co-workers are
just staring at me in disbelief.

15:18.619 --> 15:21.289
Oh, man. Is this the story about
how your face got fucked up?

15:21.322 --> 15:23.123
I'm trying to convince this guy
it's just a fucking sports joke.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.393
I named every rookie
on the triple-A roster

15:25.426 --> 15:26.394
until he finally,
like, breaks down,

15:26.427 --> 15:27.895
he starts fucking laughing.

15:27.928 --> 15:29.297
See, this is why you should
never try to be funny.

15:29.930 --> 15:30.964
Look who's here.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.257
Look, the little wolf.

15:39.239 --> 15:40.308
Get to it.

15:40.341 --> 15:42.042
Found your guy.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.812
- What guy?
- The one you've been bustin' my ass about.

15:44.845 --> 15:46.447
Pasty fucker,
talking to Cups in the yards.

15:47.748 --> 15:49.552
Name's Adam Hutchings.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.620
Some kind of reporter.

15:52.653 --> 15:54.736
Yeah, he said he's fixing to
make Cups famous or some shit.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.725
Wow, Lobo. This could
break the case wide open.

15:57.758 --> 15:58.892
So my sheet clean?

15:58.926 --> 16:00.394
I don't see why not?

16:00.428 --> 16:01.762
I don't know a judge in town

16:01.795 --> 16:03.497
who wouldn't flush
your entire criminal record

16:03.531 --> 16:05.232
for telling us
something we already know.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.417
Swing and a miss, Lobo,
that's strike two.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.885
Who shot the judge's kid?

16:11.505 --> 16:12.806
I'm working on it.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.832
Hey, look.
It's your buddies over there.

16:14.867 --> 16:16.644
No, no, no.

16:16.677 --> 16:18.553
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

16:18.588 --> 16:19.980
He's gonna get me killed.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.782
What's our incentive
to keep you unkilled?

16:21.815 --> 16:23.851
How about some human decency?

16:23.884 --> 16:25.353
Ain't heard of it. You want
me to go get them right now?

16:25.386 --> 16:26.354
'Cause I can.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.658
All right, we're moving
a stash house tonight.

16:30.691 --> 16:32.192
What makes you think
we give a shit about

16:32.225 --> 16:33.594
a couple of dime bags?

16:33.627 --> 16:34.895
- This is different.
- Why is that?

16:39.900 --> 16:41.435
'Cause Cups is gonna be there.

16:41.469 --> 16:43.937
Cups is gonna be there,
like in the same fucking room?

16:43.971 --> 16:45.154
Yeah, that's what
I'm telling y'all.

16:49.343 --> 16:50.478
So, uh...

16:52.245 --> 16:54.992
Like I said, I didn't know
what I was taking.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.418
I just picked up
what was sitting there.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.824
I didn't mean to
cause you any problems.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.601
You've always been good to me.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.132
Yeah.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.401
I never should have
listened to Adam.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.236
He begged, you know.

17:21.541 --> 17:22.742
And I needed the money.

17:29.417 --> 17:30.784
CC, how long
have we known each other?

17:32.520 --> 17:34.087
Five, six years.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.723
What do I drink?

17:35.756 --> 17:37.591
Uh, well, Michter's, neat.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.728
If you're eating,
then it's Chateau Haut-Brion.

17:40.761 --> 17:43.196
So, I'm not just some
random customer.

17:43.931 --> 17:45.733
No, sir.

17:45.766 --> 17:48.403
- Would you say we were friends?
- We are.

17:49.437 --> 17:52.576
Where I come from, friends
don't fuck over other friends.

17:53.474 --> 17:54.408
Yeah.

17:56.610 --> 17:57.645
You're gonna make this
up to me.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.448
Yes, sir.

18:00.481 --> 18:01.281
That wasn't a question.

18:03.551 --> 18:04.552
No, of course.

18:05.419 --> 18:06.554
Of course not.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.204
Now get out of here and give me
a minute to talk to Mr. Kelly.

18:13.761 --> 18:15.387
Thank you.

18:23.771 --> 18:25.873
I guess, a marker
is always a marker.

18:25.906 --> 18:26.740
I found your leak.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.342
I guess our business is done.

18:31.679 --> 18:33.165
Is that what you want?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.455
You know, if I was
blonde-haired, blue-eyed

18:41.489 --> 18:43.123
Brooks Brothers-wearing
son of a bitch

18:43.156 --> 18:44.725
from Winston ***

18:44.758 --> 18:46.355
this is where I'd say
something like...

18:46.794 --> 18:48.896
I like the cut of your jib.

18:48.929 --> 18:50.397
Fact of the matter is,

18:50.430 --> 18:51.665
I have no idea what a jib is.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.335
Well...

18:57.705 --> 18:58.706
I'll think about it.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.678
Yeah. All right.

19:06.680 --> 19:08.616
Take all the time you need.

19:08.649 --> 19:10.527
Until end of business
tomorrow, that is.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.490
Thanks for the drink.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.028
All right, Cups,
where the fuck are you?

19:22.462 --> 19:23.697
I had a date tonight, you know?

19:23.731 --> 19:25.670
So, go.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.307
Get out of here.

19:29.803 --> 19:32.372
I know how bitchy you get
when you're all stopped up.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.390
Jack ever complain
about your late nights?

19:37.377 --> 19:39.613
Bed to himself,
what's to complain about?

19:39.647 --> 19:41.448
I don't know,
you're out on stakeouts

19:41.481 --> 19:44.017
with virile young lawmen.

19:44.051 --> 19:46.687
Doesn't he ever worry about
what you might get up to?

19:46.720 --> 19:49.997
No, he knows I'm with you.

20:05.773 --> 20:07.507
Fucking Lobo.

20:07.541 --> 20:10.134
Fucking Lobo.

20:14.014 --> 20:15.248
I thought you said payback
was bad for business.

20:15.282 --> 20:17.217
Look, man,
I changed my mind. Yo!

20:17.250 --> 20:20.520
Put the motherfucking
flashbangs down, man!

20:20.554 --> 20:21.989
What the fuck's
wrong with y'all?

20:22.022 --> 20:23.090
Goddamn!

20:32.933 --> 20:34.668
Y'all get the fuck out, man.

20:34.702 --> 20:35.736
Let's go! Get out!

20:45.112 --> 20:47.414
Look, man.
Latrell capped D, all right?

20:47.447 --> 20:49.683
- I don't know Latrell.
- You don't need to.

20:49.717 --> 20:51.904
- But you're gonna take care of him.
- All right.

20:52.052 --> 20:53.220
Want me to bring Lobo along?

20:53.253 --> 20:55.055
Yeah, you go and do that,

20:55.088 --> 20:56.624
and when you're done, you
gonna take care of him, too.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.961
What the fuck
you just say to me?

21:00.994 --> 21:02.429
Listen to me, my nigger,
your brother's been talking,

21:02.462 --> 21:04.064
the nigger is a snitch.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.766
- Fuck that!
- Listen, man.

21:05.799 --> 21:08.068
Police, Feds, all that shit
got to be handled.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.637
I'm serious, man.
Shut the fuck up!

21:09.670 --> 21:11.772
Listen to me, man! This shit's
already been confirmed.

21:11.805 --> 21:14.141
- I'm sorry, D.
- Nah, nah.

21:14.174 --> 21:15.408
He's just unloaded
like a key for y'all.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.077
He's fuckin' working.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.846
He's working and then
he's also talking, man.

21:21.649 --> 21:23.150
So why're you telling me this?

21:23.183 --> 21:25.118
'Cause there's some delicate
circumstances right now.

21:25.152 --> 21:26.319
I gotta know where you fall.

21:26.353 --> 21:27.988
Nah.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.289
I'm not doing it.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.259
My nigger,
I don't make the rules.

21:32.459 --> 21:33.627
He's family, Cups!

21:33.661 --> 21:35.875
So are we.

21:37.698 --> 21:39.733
Now, look, I feel you.
I do, all right?

21:39.767 --> 21:42.659
But this shit's gonna be
handled one way or another.

21:45.338 --> 21:47.507
Don't you want your face to be
the last one that he sees?

22:57.210 --> 22:59.212
- I ain't asking for much.
- Look, I can't do it, Tal.

22:59.246 --> 23:01.715
Oh, like you're so hard up?

23:01.749 --> 23:03.917
Oren has got
your weekly, right?

23:03.951 --> 23:05.585
So let's talk about
the rest tonight.

23:05.618 --> 23:06.920
You owe me, Mar.

23:08.621 --> 23:11.058
I said I'll find you
something, all right?

23:11.091 --> 23:12.726
- I'll find you something.
- I don't need you to find me shit.

23:12.760 --> 23:13.660
- Oh, yeah?
- I find my own.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.028
Hey.

23:15.062 --> 23:16.663
- The fundraiser, right?
- Yeah. Ethan.

23:16.696 --> 23:19.232
I'm Marlon.
This is my sister Talia.

23:19.266 --> 23:20.267
Oh, very nice
to meet you, Talia.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.268
Hey.

23:22.435 --> 23:23.670
Leave you to business.

23:23.703 --> 23:24.637
Mmm.

23:26.273 --> 23:27.707
So what're you
in the market for?

23:27.741 --> 23:29.009
Oh, I was just
in the neighborhood,

23:29.042 --> 23:31.111
I thought I'd stop by and see
what all the hype's about.

23:31.144 --> 23:32.545
Yeah? So how're we
doing so far?

23:32.579 --> 23:34.281
Not bad. Not bad.

23:34.314 --> 23:36.083
Let's see if we can
upgrade that to just fine.

23:39.286 --> 23:40.954
So, uh...

23:40.988 --> 23:42.722
What would something
like this go for?

23:42.756 --> 23:43.924
Just a little bit under $3,000.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.394
$3,000 for that?

23:56.069 --> 23:58.105
Hey, Talia!

23:58.138 --> 24:00.173
I was just about to call
Marlon, got your weekly ready.

24:01.842 --> 24:03.310
How are you?

24:03.343 --> 24:03.977
I've been better.

24:06.246 --> 24:07.848
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

24:08.581 --> 24:09.582
Got all day?

24:11.852 --> 24:13.954
Things are rough, huh?

24:13.987 --> 24:15.155
Things are shit
is what they are.

24:32.505 --> 24:33.841
Uh, $5,000.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.680
Uh, Talia?

24:46.319 --> 24:47.654
I'm sorry.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.485
Uh, it's okay, it's okay.

24:53.193 --> 24:55.195
I thought this was it,
you know, like...

24:55.228 --> 24:56.997
Like real, true love.

24:58.631 --> 25:01.027
But then he goes
and fucks my best friend

25:02.169 --> 25:05.670
- in a fucking bathroom stall.
- Oh.

25:09.176 --> 25:11.144
Do you have a, uh...

25:11.178 --> 25:14.514
- A tissue?
- Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.

25:14.547 --> 25:17.017
Let me just, um...

25:17.050 --> 25:18.852
Just, just stay right there.

25:46.079 --> 25:47.180
Thank you.

25:48.515 --> 25:49.582
I should go.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.955
Hold on.

26:01.561 --> 26:02.862
Your allowance?

26:05.933 --> 26:06.900
Thank you.

26:37.998 --> 26:40.067
Oh, hey.

26:40.100 --> 26:41.234
I got it.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.135
Wh...

26:43.170 --> 26:44.471
What?

26:44.504 --> 26:46.194
I got the 30 grand.

26:47.774 --> 26:49.576
Oh, shit.

26:49.609 --> 26:52.297
This is... Oh, yeah.
Okay, cool.

26:53.813 --> 26:55.915
So, what happens next?

26:55.949 --> 26:57.617
I'm gonna... I'm gonna get
the ball rolling on this.

26:57.650 --> 27:00.453
I'm gonna call you tomorrow.
We're going to, uh...

27:00.487 --> 27:02.422
We'll put together a meeting,
strategy, we could put together

27:02.455 --> 27:03.490
a marketing plan.

27:05.325 --> 27:06.626
This is gonna be great.

27:07.594 --> 27:08.996
Yeah.

27:09.029 --> 27:10.430
All right.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.431
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:11.464 --> 27:12.499
Okay.

27:16.469 --> 27:17.870
This is gonna be great.
Thanks.

27:20.273 --> 27:21.274
Holy shit.

27:45.732 --> 27:47.634
It has three speeds,
comes with multiple heads,

27:47.667 --> 27:49.969
AM and PM rejuvenating cleanser

27:50.003 --> 27:52.005
and it is fantastic
for blackheads.

27:52.039 --> 27:53.206
How much?

27:53.240 --> 27:54.874
With tax it'll be $326.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.643
And if I'm payin' cash?

27:56.676 --> 27:57.644
$326.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.815
Y'all don't know
how to run a business, do you?

28:17.697 --> 28:19.966
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I can't accept this.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.568
Excuse me?

28:21.601 --> 28:23.478
Do you have any other
method of payment?

28:25.072 --> 28:29.668
Bitch, I got all the methods
of payment.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.878
What the fuck kind of place
don't take cash?

28:31.911 --> 28:34.070
We take cash.
Just not this cash.

28:34.447 --> 28:37.150
Fuck this place. Fuck you.

28:37.184 --> 28:40.489
Fuck your infomercial trash,
garbage shit.

31:03.763 --> 31:05.031
Oh, shit.

31:06.766 --> 31:08.235
Hey, Dad.

31:08.268 --> 31:09.436
Ethan Kelly?

31:10.737 --> 31:12.171
This is him.

31:12.205 --> 31:14.140
This is the Chicago
Fire Department, sir.

31:14.173 --> 31:15.508
Your father had a heart attack,

31:15.542 --> 31:17.244
and he asked us to call you.

31:17.277 --> 31:19.078
- Is he okay?
- Hyper acute

31:19.111 --> 31:21.514
ST segments on EKG.
Push TPA.

31:23.283 --> 31:25.552
We're on our way
to the Chicago City Hospital.

31:25.585 --> 31:26.919
Any way you could
meet us there?

31:26.953 --> 31:30.281
Yeah, yeah.
I'm on my way.

31:34.126 --> 31:36.396
Just in the neighborhood
again, right?

31:36.429 --> 31:37.930
This is a strange
coincidence...

31:37.964 --> 31:39.968
Fuck your coincidence.
What the fuck I look like?

31:41.100 --> 31:43.995
Get the fuck gone now, Ethan.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.802
Fuck!

31:51.778 --> 31:53.413
Oh, God!

31:53.446 --> 31:55.147
It's Lobo. It's the third time
he's called.

31:56.883 --> 31:58.585
- Maybe he's got something.
- Jesus Christ!

31:58.618 --> 32:00.219
What do you want me to say?

32:00.253 --> 32:01.954
God, I know you're right.
Fuck it, I'm done with him.

32:04.624 --> 32:06.893
Harper Deakins. Please leave a message.

32:08.461 --> 32:09.729
Shit!

32:09.762 --> 32:11.464
Thought you were taking a piss.

32:11.498 --> 32:12.299
Who you calling?

32:14.601 --> 32:15.768
Nobody.

32:16.836 --> 32:17.904
Didn't look like nobody.

32:19.672 --> 32:21.308
It's nothing, all right?

32:33.085 --> 32:34.421
Hey, so what if he ain't alone?

32:35.254 --> 32:36.656
He ain't gonna be alone.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.926
I mean, what if he
come out with, like,

32:39.959 --> 32:41.160
I don't know,
kids and shit, man?

32:42.295 --> 32:45.041
I don't know.
What you think?

32:45.832 --> 32:48.167
I don't want to do no kid.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.602
Getting got to
get done, all right?

32:53.105 --> 32:54.106
Yeah.

32:55.942 --> 32:57.677
All right.

32:57.710 --> 33:00.246
Should be coming out of
that church any minute.

33:00.279 --> 33:01.314
Keep your eyes
peeled, all right?

33:02.715 --> 33:03.883
Hey, you remember this place?

33:08.020 --> 33:09.322
When Ma caught us
dumping tadpoles

33:09.356 --> 33:10.490
in the fountain during service.

33:10.523 --> 33:11.958
Shit. Yeah, I remember.

33:14.193 --> 33:15.462
You ever seen Ma that mad?

33:15.495 --> 33:16.729
Here they come.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.333
All right, he's a goofy
looking nigger

33:20.367 --> 33:21.501
with a blonde streak
in his hair.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.142
I got him.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.525
Yo, Latrell!

33:45.558 --> 33:47.560
Gun!

33:59.539 --> 34:01.502
Motherfucker.

34:14.353 --> 34:15.588
Come on! Come on!

34:25.732 --> 34:27.996
What the fuck is wrong with you?

34:49.822 --> 34:51.322
George Kelly? He was
brought in by ambulance.

34:54.994 --> 34:57.263
Sorry, sir, there's no one
here by that name.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.798
Well, check again, I just
talked to the paramedics.

34:58.831 --> 35:00.767
He had a heart attack.

35:00.800 --> 35:01.768
I'm sorry, sir.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.525
I'm not here for you.

35:33.299 --> 35:34.767
What the hell
is going on, Grace?

35:36.503 --> 35:38.004
You know, you got a tail.

35:38.037 --> 35:39.739
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

35:39.772 --> 35:40.707
Look.

35:42.509 --> 35:44.243
Spring Peaks Hotel.

35:44.276 --> 35:48.202
Room 1404. 11:00.

35:48.237 --> 35:49.649
And don't bring your friend.

35:49.682 --> 35:52.519
Why would I show up there?

35:52.552 --> 35:54.787
Because something tells me that
you're just as fucked as I am.

35:57.156 --> 35:59.025
Stay an hour.

35:59.058 --> 36:00.326
Then tell him
your stitches ripped.

36:29.989 --> 36:31.023
All right, man, we good.

36:32.692 --> 36:33.860
Yeah.

36:35.094 --> 36:36.395
Yeah, we good.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.366
You a man today, 'Bo.

36:41.200 --> 36:43.069
Man, what?

36:43.102 --> 36:45.237
You came out hard,
that's all I'm sayin'.

36:47.006 --> 36:49.508
Yeah, but, you know
the damn gun jammed.

36:49.542 --> 36:50.743
- Piece of shit.
- Hey!

36:52.779 --> 36:54.413
That don't make no difference.

36:55.715 --> 36:58.637
You showed something.
For real.

36:58.918 --> 36:59.952
All right.

37:06.559 --> 37:07.594
I love you.

37:09.696 --> 37:11.582
You know that, right?

37:12.765 --> 37:14.662
I love you.

37:41.594 --> 37:42.795
I'm so sorry.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.497
I'm sorry.

37:47.133 --> 37:47.967
It's cool.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.637
It's all good.

37:51.671 --> 37:52.905
It's all good.

40:20.619 --> 40:23.055
I gotta admit, Grace,

40:23.089 --> 40:24.791
I didn't think I'd see you
in another emergency room.

40:24.824 --> 40:26.225
Yeah.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.794
Just like old times, right?

40:28.327 --> 40:29.228
Yeah.

40:32.731 --> 40:33.966
Put your hands up.

40:34.901 --> 40:36.068
You wearing a wire?

40:39.906 --> 40:40.773
All right, my turn.

40:41.774 --> 40:43.709
Come on.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.577
Now that we're done
with the foreplay...

40:45.611 --> 40:48.147
Wanna tell me
what you're doing here?

40:48.180 --> 40:50.404
I'm in some serious shit.

40:52.118 --> 40:53.986
And naturally you come to your
best friend for help, huh?

40:55.988 --> 40:57.389
They wanna kill me, they tried.

40:57.423 --> 40:59.625
Who did?

40:59.658 --> 41:01.928
The same people who've been
cleaning up after you.

41:01.961 --> 41:04.063
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:04.096 --> 41:08.011
Oh, come on. Pakistan.
The money laundering. Ray's murder.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.602
Someone's trying really hard
to keep you in play.

41:10.636 --> 41:12.671
Why?

41:12.704 --> 41:15.107
Well, maybe I just
have good friends.

41:15.141 --> 41:16.675
Not anymore, you don't.

41:22.849 --> 41:24.571
Why are you so
important to them?

41:26.986 --> 41:28.888
You must be doing something valuable
to collect all those favors.

41:30.722 --> 41:32.959
Do you think I'm here
by choice, Grace?

41:32.992 --> 41:34.994
Things seem to be working out
just fine for you so far.

41:35.027 --> 41:36.528
Oh, yeah?
What's working out fine?

41:36.562 --> 41:38.865
There's nothing
working out about this.

41:38.898 --> 41:40.266
I'm a prisoner in
my own goddamn life.

41:40.299 --> 41:41.500
I know all about that.

41:41.533 --> 41:43.469
Maybe we should make T-shirts.

41:43.502 --> 41:45.371
You don't want to make those motherfuckers pay?
What's wrong with you?

41:46.906 --> 41:48.607
They're the common enemy.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.776
You could be an ally.
We could figure this out.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.378
- Are you insane?
- I'm motivated.

41:52.411 --> 41:54.791
Motivated to do what?

41:55.014 --> 41:57.483
Build a case?
Expose the conspiracy?

41:57.516 --> 41:59.651
- Bring down the bad guy?
- Why not?

41:59.685 --> 42:01.353
- I want...
- What? What, Grace?

42:01.387 --> 42:03.455
Justice? Is that what
you were gonna say?

42:03.489 --> 42:04.957
Please tell me you weren't
gonna say justice,

42:04.991 --> 42:07.960
I mean, God damn it, how long
have you been a cop?

42:07.994 --> 42:11.230
How long have you been on that
side and you still don't know?

42:11.263 --> 42:12.865
You're still throwin' around
the word like you're some

42:12.899 --> 42:14.967
wide-eyed,
fresh-out-of-the-academy

42:15.001 --> 42:16.302
something I don't
even fucking know.

42:16.335 --> 42:17.669
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

42:17.703 --> 42:19.638
Oh, don't give me that shit.

42:19.671 --> 42:21.974
- I served eight years overseas...
- Oh, yeah.

42:22.008 --> 42:24.143
- ...fighting for justice.
- Mmm-hmm.

42:24.176 --> 42:25.912
Let me tell you something.
It doesn't exist.

42:25.945 --> 42:27.880
And if it ever did,
it's fucking gone.

42:29.248 --> 42:30.682
These people
that you talk about,

42:30.716 --> 42:33.185
these people responsible
for this or for that,

42:33.219 --> 42:34.720
they're the ones,
they're the closest you get.

42:34.753 --> 42:36.255
They're the deciders.

42:36.288 --> 42:39.191
They decide what justice is
and what it isn't.

42:39.225 --> 42:40.759
Yeah. And I don't
have a choice.

42:41.427 --> 42:43.662
I can't go home.

42:43.695 --> 42:46.232
I can't see my family.
I can't do my fucking job.

42:46.265 --> 42:47.766
This is the only
option I've got.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.768
It's not an option.

42:49.801 --> 42:52.204
Trust me.

42:52.238 --> 42:54.240
Just because you're too pussy
to fight for your own life,

42:54.273 --> 42:55.674
- doesn't mean the rest of us are.
- Jesus Christ.

42:57.209 --> 42:58.877
You think I like
being a puppet,

42:58.911 --> 43:01.347
with a hand shoved up my ass?

43:01.380 --> 43:03.049
These people, Grace,

43:03.082 --> 43:05.251
there's no bringing them down.

43:05.284 --> 43:07.386
You see, once you're in,
you're in.

43:07.419 --> 43:08.620
Until they say otherwise.

43:08.654 --> 43:10.756
Fuck you. And fuck that
helpless crap.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.793
I guess things just haven't
got bad enough for you yet.

43:14.826 --> 43:15.794
My God...

43:17.663 --> 43:19.165
You really are insane.

43:21.467 --> 43:22.734
You got any booze
in this shithole?

43:22.768 --> 43:24.003
I need a drink.

43:28.740 --> 43:29.775
Deakins.

43:31.677 --> 43:33.650
Fuck. When?

43:35.114 --> 43:36.615
God damn it.

43:38.350 --> 43:39.351
Yeah, I'm on my way.

43:40.186 --> 43:41.787
What was that?

43:41.820 --> 43:44.323
- I think Cups fucked us.
- What?

43:44.356 --> 43:45.958
CPD caught a couple bodies
on Shepard.

43:45.992 --> 43:47.593
One of 'em matches
the description

43:47.626 --> 43:49.795
that college kid gave
on our shooter.

43:51.964 --> 43:53.532
So much for that fear.

44:08.180 --> 44:10.149
Agent Deakins?

44:10.182 --> 44:11.317
Patrol just called in
another one.

44:11.350 --> 44:12.784
Couple blocks away.

44:12.818 --> 44:13.919
He's got a Smith and Wesson
on him.

44:13.952 --> 44:14.686
We think he's one
of the shooters.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.322
Great, thanks. Let's go.

44:49.488 --> 44:50.489
Hey!

44:51.490 --> 44:53.059
You okay?

44:53.092 --> 44:54.260
What? Yeah.

44:56.028 --> 44:57.396
This is not on you.

44:58.597 --> 44:59.698
You hear me?

45:00.499 --> 45:01.800
This is not your fault.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.069
Yeah, I know.

45:04.170 --> 45:05.104
I'm fine.

45:08.507 --> 45:09.675
It's gonna be okay.

45:09.708 --> 45:11.510
Will it?

45:11.543 --> 45:13.379
Because nothing in this case
is going right, Pat.

45:13.412 --> 45:14.613
Like, nothing.

45:38.537 --> 45:40.063
You good?

45:43.409 --> 45:44.776
Why you ain't do it
at the church, man?

45:47.779 --> 45:48.814
It's done, ain't it?

45:59.325 --> 46:01.059
Our mom is buried there.

46:03.262 --> 46:04.896
I didn't want her to see that.

46:07.799 --> 46:09.168
All right, man. Come on.

46:10.302 --> 46:11.803
We got something else.

46:52.511 --> 46:55.347
He's still got your medals and
all your trophies lined up.

46:58.617 --> 47:01.153
Grace Travis in the home
I grew up in.

47:01.187 --> 47:02.188
Wow.

47:03.189 --> 47:04.523
That's pretty weird.

47:05.357 --> 47:06.792
He's so proud of you.

47:09.027 --> 47:10.941
That's because
he doesn't know me.

47:13.699 --> 47:16.001
Most sons would love it if their
dads were that proud of them.

47:19.037 --> 47:21.640
Yeah, well, I suppose
it's easy to live in some

47:21.673 --> 47:24.343
bullshit made-up
fantasy world.

47:24.376 --> 47:25.911
But who the hell
would want that?

47:33.084 --> 47:34.686
Did Sam make that for you?

47:40.058 --> 47:42.093
I read about the shooting,
when I looked into you, Grace.

47:44.396 --> 47:45.264
I'm sorry for your loss.

47:50.936 --> 47:53.104
- He made it on his first day of school...
- Hmm.

47:56.542 --> 47:58.844
I put it in a box to give it
to him when he was older.

48:07.553 --> 48:08.420
Hmm.

48:14.926 --> 48:16.828
It's getting early,
I'm gonna...

48:16.862 --> 48:18.397
I'm gonna go.

48:18.430 --> 48:20.098
How do you think
this ends for you?

48:23.869 --> 48:25.937
Huh?

48:25.971 --> 48:27.506
I'm not sure, yet.

48:27.539 --> 48:28.974
- They're gonna kill you.
- Hmm.

48:30.376 --> 48:33.712
No matter what you do for them.

48:33.745 --> 48:35.447
Or how valuable
you are right now.

48:36.715 --> 48:38.746
That's how this ends.

48:40.586 --> 48:42.901
Well, we'll see.

48:45.724 --> 48:47.125
You take care, Grace.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.481
Move!
