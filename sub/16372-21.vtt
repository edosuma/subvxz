00:02.920 --> 00:03.956
What the hell is going on?

00:04.120 --> 00:06.191
Is this fool going to deliver?
It's been an hour!

00:06.400 --> 00:08.039
Relax. It's fine!

00:12.920 --> 00:16.152
It's been an hour, Raymond.
Your men coming or not?

00:16.320 --> 00:18.789
As I said, there's been a slight delay
at the border.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.440
Yes, you said that.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.159
I'll kill him if he screws me on this.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.596
I'm taking a great risk here.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.515
Salaam seems grouchy. Perhaps
he's hungry. God knows I'm starving.

00:27.680 --> 00:30.832
What the hell are we doing
standing around in this warehouse?

00:31.000 --> 00:33.356
Let's get a meal,
break bread, drink some arak.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.752
When the shipment gets here,
we'll finish our business.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.631
- The truck isn't coming, is it?
- What is that supposed to mean?

00:41.520 --> 00:44.638
I've heard the rumors, Raymond.
We all have.

00:45.520 --> 00:46.840
- People are whispering.
- What?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.514
Tell him I'm done waiting.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.391
They're saying bills are not being paid.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.553
Yeah, suppliers are defecting.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.919
People are talking, Raymond.
The rats are fleeing the ship.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.510
I'll put a bullet in his head
if he's lied.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.800
We need these weapons.

01:04.280 --> 01:08.160
He has men waiting for arms. If they're
not supplied as promised, they'll die.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.470
The truck will be here.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.711
My sons need arms.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.033
The lives of my boys depend on you.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.396
Their blood is on your hands.

01:16.040 --> 01:17.030
Take it easy. Calm down.

01:18.280 --> 01:23.196
Rhinehart, assure your client, as much
as I detest him and his dirty little war...

01:23.360 --> 01:27.036
...his shipment is en route
and will get here when it gets here.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.352
However, if he expects
to take delivery...

01:30.520 --> 01:33.513
...he needs to put his gun
back in his pants.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.310
If that truck doesn't show,
we're all dead. Understand?

01:37.960 --> 01:38.996
We're dead.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.669
Tell him to put the gun down.

01:42.920 --> 01:43.956
And what do you know?

01:56.800 --> 01:58.314
I got here as soon as I could.

01:58.480 --> 02:01.473
But the situation at the border
is the least of our problems.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.436
- What happened?
- The supplier never showed.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.917
They sent a man to say your funds
never arrived. There was yelling.

02:09.080 --> 02:12.357
He said the Beck family is done
doing business with Mr. Reddington.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.715
Then he left.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.155
The blood of my sons is on your...

02:22.760 --> 02:26.037
Indeed, the rats are fleeing, Dembe.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.756
If the payment wasn't made, it's because
Kaplan's making a run on the bank.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.715
Get Abe on the phone.
Let's find out what deals are in play.

02:43.840 --> 02:48.039
The deal will be fine. Things are
nowhere near as bad as you believe.

02:48.200 --> 02:49.714
No, no.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.237
No, the Latvian route is defunct,
which is fine.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.557
I have many other resources.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.280
No, you should've received those funds.
We sent them.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.909
She said anything? Call Brimley.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.150
What?

03:02.320 --> 03:04.880
Yes, of course.
I'm confirming that as we speak.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.595
What the hell is going on
with Bank Rheinfelden?

03:08.480 --> 03:11.234
Confirmation of the funds transfer.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.360
For what it's worth, I can assure you,
there have been no security breaches...

03:15.520 --> 03:17.671
...in the event
Mr. Reddington would reconsider.

03:17.880 --> 03:19.917
He won't reconsider. Thank you.

03:20.080 --> 03:24.120
Yes, yes, Von Hauser is gone, which
is unfortunate but indicative of nothing.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.910
I can assure you, the passage is safe
and the documents are clean.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.549
I've got Rice on the line. He's...

03:30.720 --> 03:32.996
Your only risk is if you step out now...

03:33.160 --> 03:36.915
...your clients end up with inferior
material, or worse yet, end up in custody.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.196
Fine.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.994
- He hung up.
- Well, what did he say?

03:43.200 --> 03:44.714
Canceled the order.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.440
It appears the Frankfurt
and Bagan accounts are both gone.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.320
I thought Kaplan was removed
from the account.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.837
She must be trading on your trust,
saying she still represents you.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.638
Oh, it's exhilarating.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.992
I can actually feel
my body releasing endorphins.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.597
You were on the treadmill
for 15 minutes, walking.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.117
Race walking. It's an Olympic sport.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.875
This is why you're good for me.
I never exercise.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.872
I feel amazing.

04:15.040 --> 04:16.918
It's like a total stress reducer.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.149
Aram Mojtabai?

04:21.160 --> 04:23.117
- Yeah?
- You've been subpoenaed to appear...

04:23.320 --> 04:26.233
...in front of a federal grand jury
tomorrow, noon.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.472
- Everything's there in the envelope.
- Is this about the task force?

04:29.640 --> 04:31.040
Did everyone get one of these?

04:31.200 --> 04:35.319
It's illegal to tell a target of an investigation
that you've been called to testify.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.551
Keep it to yourself.

04:41.160 --> 04:42.514
Knock, knock.

04:42.680 --> 04:46.117
Brimley, at last, a friendly face.

04:46.480 --> 04:47.470
Here, here.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.920
Two rabbits.

04:52.600 --> 04:56.594
There's a woman in the other room.
I need you to get her to divulge...

04:56.760 --> 04:59.400
...the name and the address
of Kaplan's new driver.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.396
I'm skipping euchre with the Saltmans
to tell you this face to face. I'm out.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.358
Please, we can discuss that later.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.716
I'm with you, what, 19 years?

05:08.880 --> 05:12.715
There's talk of bodies turning up,
an investigation.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.520
I wanna help. You're hotter
than a four-peckered goat...

05:15.680 --> 05:18.752
...and I can't risk doing another stretch,
not even for you.

05:18.960 --> 05:20.394
I need you, Teddy.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.995
Betsy's the best I can do for you.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.314
You know what my time at Lompoc did.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.393
No dust mite covers,
no hypoallergenic pillows.

05:29.560 --> 05:33.554
I barely made it,
and that was before the hypoxemia.

05:33.720 --> 05:37.077
Whatever you need her to say,
Betsy will squeeze it out of her.

05:37.240 --> 05:41.757
- And then it's rabbit stew for dinner.
- Not stewed, live.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.879
She likes a little tickle in her throat.

05:48.720 --> 05:52.191
Mr. Reddington.
Whatever this is, I don't wanna know.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.431
- The accounts?
- I've gone over each one.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.195
- And?
- She's cleaning you out.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.232
It's brutal.

06:11.720 --> 06:14.838
Yeah, the ME says
the decapitation occurred postmortem.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.831
Why do you think
Reddington would do that?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.957
Maybe he gave it to someone as proof.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.237
You know, a warning to an enemy.

06:22.440 --> 06:26.753
See, I'm thinking he gave it
to a friend as a gift...

06:26.920 --> 06:28.877
...like an offering.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.556
<i>Donald, I want you to know
that I do understand how you feel.</i>

06:32.720 --> 06:35.110
<i>- From Mr. Reddington.
- You get an ID?</i>

06:35.280 --> 06:38.751
Oh, yeah. I ID'd the body,
and I was able to ID the friend.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.635
<i>- You know where to find him?
- I already did.</i>

06:43.200 --> 06:45.669
He's standing right in front of me.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.433
This is Mako Tanida.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.832
He killed some
of the Bureau's best men and women.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.437
And then Reddington goes and kills him.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.316
Why would Reddington do that?

06:59.520 --> 07:02.274
In exchange for your protection.

07:03.240 --> 07:06.870
I followed you to the woods.
I saw you and Keen with Reddington.

07:07.040 --> 07:10.590
I was wrong.
Keen wasn't informing Reddington.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.992
Reddington was informing you,
the Bureau.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.159
After everything we did
to try and hunt down Reddington...

07:17.320 --> 07:21.951
...after everything that Reddington did,
America's most wanted man...

07:23.280 --> 07:24.680
- ...you cut a deal with him.
- No.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.999
No, Julian. I didn't make a deal,
all right? Main Justice did.

07:29.160 --> 07:34.679
And when I found out, what you're feeling
right now, that's exactly how I felt.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.274
So then what?

07:36.440 --> 07:38.352
Reddington cuts Tanida's head off.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.600
And you think, "Whoa, not so bad having
an assassin on the payroll."

07:42.760 --> 07:47.073
No, no, you went to Records. You read
SCI-7. You know the good we do.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.880
- Are you trying to justify this to me?
- In four years...

07:50.360 --> 07:53.239
...we've made more high-level arrests
than every other division combined.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.153
Yeah, okay.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.279
Reddington's a mass murderer.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.391
If I can prove that you
or anybody else on the task force...

08:02.560 --> 08:05.473
...turned a blind eye
when he killed any of these people...

08:05.640 --> 08:07.757
...I'm gonna take you down.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.794
Yeah, I'm gonna take everybody down.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.556
- Was that a threat?
- It's a promise.

08:24.480 --> 08:27.075
- Don Julio.
- Raymond.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.594
How are you?

08:28.760 --> 08:33.232
I miss Alonissos.
No money. Shack on the beach.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.833
Dreams of infamy.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.636
That was a lifetime ago.

08:37.799 --> 08:39.712
Two, maybe.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.477
You said you had a question.
If so, I must ask you to be brief about it.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.790
Don Julio, I've never known you
to be brusque.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.119
- Certainly not at meal time.
- I hear things, Raymond.

08:54.280 --> 08:58.718
And what I hear is that Mr. Kaplan has
proven to be a formidable adversary.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.552
I have a name.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.517
Squeezed it out of a contractor
in Kaplan's employ. Phillip Roque.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.637
I understand he used to be your driver.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.952
- If I get to him, I get to Kaplan.
- Can't help you.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.239
Can't? Or wont?

09:17.920 --> 09:20.640
Seems this Mr. Kaplan pays well.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.237
I'm told that Roque recently bought
a Porsche.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.831
- That's all you know?
- No.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.079
That's all you need.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.073
Send my love to Chitra.

09:57.640 --> 10:02.157
Stainless steel, set of six.
You got your large and medium kitchen...

10:02.320 --> 10:06.109
...your boning, your fruit,
your paring, and your bread.

10:06.280 --> 10:10.115
End of the month, the guy
with the most sales takes home the set.

10:10.280 --> 10:15.480
Incentive: the currency of politicians,
dog trainers and criminals.

10:15.640 --> 10:18.155
We're in a meeting here.
Who do you think you are?

10:18.320 --> 10:21.791
I'm Raymond Reddington.
I'm looking for a customer of yours.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.189
Phillip Roque.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.432
In the last four weeks,
he purchased an automobile...

10:26.640 --> 10:31.317
...from one of you fine gentlemen, tricked
out with all the bells and whistles.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.998
Anyone?

10:34.160 --> 10:35.514
No?

10:36.040 --> 10:37.440
Perhaps an incentive.

10:42.720 --> 10:46.714
You get to keep all your fingers and toes.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.072
Phillip Roque.

10:53.240 --> 10:56.597
No address or number. Everything ran
through a business manager.

10:56.800 --> 10:59.599
And who was that exactly?

11:00.240 --> 11:02.072
Hello, Abe.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.158
You won't be using that arm again.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.630
That's your left arm.
I know you're right-handed.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.520
I know that because we've
worked together for 11 years.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.273
I know your wife has diabetes.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.314
That your daughter's favorite animal
is a hippo.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.119
I know you love Chinese food.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.199
That you'd eat it every Wednesday
when you shack up with your girlfriend...

11:20.360 --> 11:23.239
...in her apartment
above WuFat Noodle House.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.156
I know you skim an extra grand
every week to help pay for that girlfriend.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.756
Abe, you steal my money
so you can get laid...

11:30.960 --> 11:33.077
...which I've ignored
because you're an accounting wizard.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.436
What I cannot ignore is your betrayal.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.274
You are how Mr. Kaplan has drained
my accounts.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.239
- Red, I can explain.
- Phillip Roque.

11:41.960 --> 11:45.715
You wired money to buy him a car.
Where is he?

11:46.840 --> 11:48.274
Page 12.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.354
- Mario Dixon?
- I can't help with Roque.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.716
I would if I knew where he was,
but I don't.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.031
Who's Mario Dixon?

12:09.960 --> 12:11.235
We have a new target.

12:14.520 --> 12:15.715
Elizabeth.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.596
I need you to find out what you can
about a Mario Dixon.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.713
Kaplan wired him
$300,000 two days ago.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.669
Whatever her next move is,
Dixon is helping her make it.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.034
Grabbing lunch at Sol's. Want anything?

13:00.200 --> 13:02.032
Tuna salad on rye.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.032
Extra pickles.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.519
Thank you, Mario.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.833
- Who are you? Where am I?
- The good news is you're going to live.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.356
The bad news is your depth perception
will never be the same.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.070
There must be some mistake.
Look, I don't... I'm nobody.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.391
Which is your dominant eye?

13:43.760 --> 13:47.515
- Agent Mojtabai, thank you for coming in.
- Did I have a choice?

13:47.720 --> 13:52.033
Victims of Reddington were recently
unearthed and turned over to the FBI.

13:52.200 --> 13:55.113
Based on the investigation,
I've convened a grand jury...

13:55.280 --> 13:59.274
...to hear testimony about whether
the task force you are a part of...

13:59.480 --> 14:02.359
...enabled Raymond Reddington
to continue committing crimes...

14:02.520 --> 14:04.557
...while working as a Bureau informant.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.918
- I have nothing to say about that.
- And whether that task force...

14:08.080 --> 14:11.312
...ignored or facilitated
those crimes in exchange for...

14:11.480 --> 14:14.439
...information Reddington provided
in pursuit of targets.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.479
If you insist on calling my client
before the grand jury...

14:17.640 --> 14:20.280
...he will invoke his fifth amendment right
against self-incrimination.

14:20.440 --> 14:23.000
- I'm granting him immunity.
- "Immunity"?

14:23.160 --> 14:28.519
To testify against my friends, who may
or may not work for a task force...

14:28.720 --> 14:33.351
...that may or may not even exist.
Yeah, I'm not doing that.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.399
I don't have to do that, right?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.069
Granting you immunity
in exchange for your testimony...

14:38.240 --> 14:39.993
...takes away your right
to plead the fifth.

14:40.160 --> 14:44.359
How? Take away my constitutional right
by granting me something I don't want.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.716
I don't want immunity. You can...

14:46.880 --> 14:49.440
I refuse to let you grant it.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.557
Consider me ungranted.

14:51.720 --> 14:55.475
Counselor, I trust you will help your client
to understand the gift he has been given.

14:55.640 --> 14:59.111
"Gift"? To turn on my friends?

14:59.280 --> 15:01.795
My alleged friends.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.913
To stay out of prison.
Unless you refuse to answer questions...

15:05.080 --> 15:08.596
...in which case you could go to jail
for being in contempt.

15:11.520 --> 15:15.116
Gale, he knows everything.
He saw me with Keen and Reddington.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.398
Yeah, but is that so terrible? I mean...

15:18.600 --> 15:21.434
It's not good,
but the task force is legal.

15:21.600 --> 15:25.230
- He can't get a grand jury to indict us.
- Who said anything about a grand jury?

15:25.440 --> 15:28.558
Gale's angle is Reddington
and what we've let him do for cases.

15:28.720 --> 15:32.839
It's a slippery moral slope
we've navigated with care, as with any CI.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.152
But our CI's responsible
for 86 homicides in America.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.357
He's ID'd most of them.
He has a timeline.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.512
He knows we've let
Reddington get away with murder.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.796
But he can't prove it.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.914
Not unless one of us testifies that it's
true, which none of us would ever do.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.993
Unless he can prove
the existence of a deal, he has nothing.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.038
But whether Gale can prove it or not...

15:51.200 --> 15:56.070
...and I'm not saying that he can because,
I mean, if I have anything to do with it...

15:56.240 --> 15:59.438
...he will not. Whatever. I'm proud
of the work that we've done here.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.677
Proud of facilitating a criminal empire?

16:01.840 --> 16:03.718
- A necessary evil.
- Maybe.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.440
Some of the blood he's spilled
is on our hands.

16:06.600 --> 16:10.071
I agree with Ressler and with Aram.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.120
I'm proud, and I'm ashamed.

16:12.320 --> 16:16.633
One day, when they teach a course
on Reddington's task force at Quantico...

16:16.800 --> 16:19.395
...we can do a panel
and debate the pros and cons.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.314
But right now we need
to get Kate Kaplan.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.314
Kaplan? I think you missed the part
about Julian Gale.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.631
- He's steps away from indicting us.
- The closer Gale gets...

16:27.840 --> 16:30.355
...the faster we need to remove Kaplan
as a threat to Reddington.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.989
- How are the two connected?
- We need Reddington to deal with Gale.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.198
- Are you suggesting killing him?
- Of course not.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.194
I'm not suggesting anything
other than what we already know.

16:39.360 --> 16:43.320
If we wanna get out from Gale's shadow,
we're gonna need Reddington's help.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.036
And if we don't stop Kaplan now,
he won't be around to give it to us.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.795
Fine. Mr. Kaplan, what do we know?

16:49.960 --> 16:53.032
<i>- Westcott scissors.
- Her real name is Kathryn Nemec.</i>

16:53.240 --> 16:55.800
<i>She's a trained mortician
turned crime scene cleaner...</i>

16:55.960 --> 16:59.431
<i>...and one of Reddington's oldest
and most trusted confidants.</i>

16:59.600 --> 17:00.829
Lacrimal dissector.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.874
Kaplan spent 30 years
tending to his messes...

17:04.079 --> 17:05.912
...while Reddington built
his criminal empire.

17:06.079 --> 17:09.835
And it took her five months
to surgically dismantle it.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.195
<i>We believe she hired Natalie Luca...</i>

17:12.359 --> 17:15.159
<i>...to go after Reddington's
money launderer, Zach Smoll.</i>

17:15.319 --> 17:17.835
Isabella Stone
to murder Stratos Sarantos...

17:18.000 --> 17:21.038
...cutting off Reddington's
Mediterranean shipping operations.

17:21.200 --> 17:25.955
Dr. Bogdan Krilov to sideline Ressler,
the Apothecary to poison Reddington.

17:26.119 --> 17:30.478
She put 86 skeletons
in the hands of Julian Gale...

17:30.640 --> 17:33.917
<i>...shutting Reddington out of Europe
completely and putting us at risk.</i>

17:34.080 --> 17:35.958
<i>- Does Reddington have any leads?
- One.</i>

17:36.120 --> 17:37.873
<i>- Mario Dixon.
- Who's he?</i>

17:38.040 --> 17:39.110
Put it on ice.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.272
<i>According to the NCIC database...</i>

17:41.440 --> 17:45.514
...Mario Brandon Dixon is a thief
who specializes in high value targets.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.514
- Jewels, art, cars, nuts.
- "Nuts"?

17:48.680 --> 17:50.194
Probably Macadamias.

17:50.360 --> 17:53.159
When stolen by truckload,
they're actually quite lucrative.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.437
It's a fun fact.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.479
- Any known associates?
- He has a kid brother in prison.

17:58.680 --> 17:59.955
Mecklenburg Correctional.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.873
- Why are you doing this?
- I told you. We're gonna need...

18:05.040 --> 18:07.032
Reddington hired
the Debt Collector to kidnap you.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.270
Which is indefensible.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.631
Allowed you to be drugged
by a sociopath.

18:10.800 --> 18:14.191
He did, and if he's in trouble,
then so are we.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.552
I'm convinced we either rise together
or fall apart.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.231
Navabi, you and Keen get
to Mecklenburg.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.278
See what the brother has to say.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.672
- If you're here about Mario...
- No, we're here for you, Dino.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.236
What you threw away for him.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.195
You graduated high school
with a 3.8 GPA...

18:39.360 --> 18:41.238
...and a soccer scholarship
to Clemson.

18:41.400 --> 18:45.713
Mario saw the life you wanted,
and he dragged you into his, into this.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.634
I know what it's like to have
a criminal brother you love.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.156
It's been a rough haul, hasn't it?

18:51.320 --> 18:53.232
If you're not in the SHU,
you're in the infirmary.

18:53.440 --> 18:54.999
We can get you moved.

18:55.160 --> 18:58.949
If the information you provide leads us
to your brother...

18:59.120 --> 19:01.794
...we're authorized
to slice five years off your sentence.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.155
Deal.

19:03.320 --> 19:06.597
Before you interrupted me,
I was gonna rat out the prick for nothing.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.036
He's got a place in Baltimore
where he keeps his booty.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.600
Checks in on it regularly.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.073
Elizabeth.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.156
What do you know?

19:18.320 --> 19:21.757
Mario Dixon works out of some
high-end hipster boutique in Hampton.

19:21.920 --> 19:25.800
<i>- We're working on a warrant now.
- Won't be necessary. Just the address.</i>

19:31.640 --> 19:34.792
Oh, my land. Look at this, Dembe.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.031
Gaited trail saddle.

19:37.200 --> 19:38.793
Do we have any need for a saddle?

19:38.960 --> 19:43.318
Wouldn't it go great
with the chaps and the spurs?

19:44.520 --> 19:46.989
Look at that crescent wrench. How fun.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.671
- What a handy little store.
- Perhaps this is the wrong place.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.196
Can I help you fellas find something?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.476
Look at you.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.956
What might this old thing be worth?

19:58.600 --> 20:02.833
Perhaps a trip to the back room.
I trust there's a back room.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.675
Now this is more like it.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.472
Where might we find Mr. Dixon?

20:16.000 --> 20:19.960
I don't know.
Honestly, I don't know who that is.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.711
You ever have one of those days
when nothing goes right?

20:24.880 --> 20:30.194
People give you the runaround,
everything seems to take twice the effort.

20:30.360 --> 20:34.400
The kind of day you'd kill
to get your mojo back.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.430
I'm having one of those days.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.873
So...

20:40.320 --> 20:43.040
...you can either be honest with me
about Mario Dixon...

20:43.200 --> 20:47.240
...or I can get behind the wheel
of this fine automobile and run you over.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.400
He's in Philly...

20:49.800 --> 20:51.439
<i>...on a job...</i>

20:51.640 --> 20:54.235
<i>...picking up a package from a client.</i>

20:56.120 --> 20:58.430
You're clear on the document
and its location?

20:58.600 --> 21:01.752
- Good to go. Keys inside?
- Yes.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.550
Please get the document.
The document is all that matters.

21:35.640 --> 21:38.678
It's okay. They're gone.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.957
Afternoon, Mr. Gorrell.

22:27.240 --> 22:29.630
- Georgie.
- Hey. Is it true?

22:29.800 --> 22:31.393
- Did they issue a subpoena?
- Yeah.

22:31.560 --> 22:33.392
An agent named Aram Mojtabai.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.314
- How great is that?
- Well, it's great if he talks.

22:36.480 --> 22:39.552
Let's hope he's not the strong,
silent type. Georgie, what's that?

22:39.720 --> 22:42.030
Lunch. Your mom dropped it off.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.919
Homemade tuna salad.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.515
She seems like a real sweet lady.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.720
<i>Dembe, call an ambulance.</i>

23:13.760 --> 23:17.117
- Why on earth would she do this?
- My eye...

23:17.280 --> 23:18.839
My eye.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.437
Why did she take your eye?

23:22.600 --> 23:27.117
There's a scanner at work.
She needs my eye for access.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.511
To what? Where do you work?

23:29.920 --> 23:32.389
Stone Canyon Storage Facility.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.678
I don't know what that is, Stone Canyon.
What's stored there?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.752
The government...

23:37.920 --> 23:41.277
The secrets, everything.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.120
Sir.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.875
ID and requisition, please.

24:46.440 --> 24:49.433
<i>- Who is this?
- You can call me "the cleaner."</i>

24:49.600 --> 24:52.718
<i>Where are you on the case,
Agent Gale?</i>

24:52.880 --> 24:54.473
You know I can't tell you that.

24:54.680 --> 24:58.071
<i>Have you presented your findings
to Main Justice?</i>

24:58.240 --> 25:00.630
How do I know you are
who you say you are?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.280
<i>Eighty-six bodies.</i>

25:02.440 --> 25:06.514
Sixty-two gunshots, 11 stabbings, nine
blunt-force traumas, four were poisoned.

25:06.680 --> 25:08.034
<i>Where are you on the case?</i>

25:08.200 --> 25:11.079
A grand jury's been convened.
Without proof of a connection...

25:11.280 --> 25:14.318
...between Reddington and the task force,
they'll never hand up an indictment.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.711
<i>- Bodies just don't give me that.
- No, they don't.</i>

25:16.880 --> 25:18.633
<i>But I can.</i>

25:30.160 --> 25:31.196
There.

25:31.360 --> 25:32.999
The guy with the shoulder bag.

25:45.320 --> 25:48.313
FBI! Hands where I can see them!

26:01.640 --> 26:04.439
We're in pursuit. Suspect's
on a motorcycle headed west...

26:04.600 --> 26:06.319
<i>...on 6th near Independence.</i>

26:12.840 --> 26:13.956
It's a dead end.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.271
Aram, he went underground.
Some kind of tunnel.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.669
<i>- Do you have eyes?
- I do.</i>

26:20.840 --> 26:23.719
And it is an absolute maze.
If I'm reading this right...

26:23.880 --> 26:26.270
<i>...he could access half the city
using these tunnels.</i>

26:26.480 --> 26:28.631
- Could you narrow that down?
- We don't have to.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.476
We got support units from the Bureau,
ATF, ICE, DEA scrambling right now.

26:32.640 --> 26:33.960
That's great. How?

26:34.120 --> 26:36.351
<i>Word got out
that Stone Canyon was compromised.</i>

26:36.520 --> 26:38.273
They insisted.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.914
FBI, halt!

27:00.080 --> 27:01.639
P.D.!

27:02.800 --> 27:04.871
Get your hands up!

27:13.480 --> 27:15.836
You Agent Keen?
We found him carrying this.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.677
- Has anyone opened it yet?
- No, ma'am.

27:19.840 --> 27:22.150
On orders
from Director Harold Cooper himself.

27:22.320 --> 27:23.720
Thank you.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.359
What is it?

27:31.720 --> 27:35.714
It's Reddington's signed immunity deal
with the Department of Justice.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.872
Let me get this straight.

27:42.040 --> 27:45.158
You think I'm going to jail?
You two are smarter than that.

27:45.320 --> 27:47.357
You shot three federal officers.

27:47.560 --> 27:49.756
You stole a document
from a government facility...

27:49.920 --> 27:52.560
- ...you shouldn't have known existed.
- You won't charge me.

27:52.720 --> 27:55.155
- Is that right?
- Oh, I guarantee it.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.875
See, I know what I stole back there.

27:58.040 --> 28:02.034
Proof of an immunity agreement
between the FBI...

28:02.240 --> 28:04.391
...and Raymond Reddington.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.756
You want some advice, Mario?
Stop talking.

28:06.920 --> 28:07.956
Stop?

28:08.160 --> 28:11.119
No, no. Ladies, I'm just getting started.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.794
So you charge me...

28:13.000 --> 28:15.754
...I have a constitutional right
to present a defense.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.317
And I promise you
that immunity deal will be exhibit A.

28:19.480 --> 28:20.596
I wouldn't celebrate.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.990
We're not charging you, but we're
not exactly letting you go either.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.389
Meaning what?

28:26.600 --> 28:28.273
You're gonna shoot me?

28:28.440 --> 28:31.080
With all due respect,
you two don't seem the type.

28:37.560 --> 28:39.233
Reddington.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.750
I'll leave you two to talk.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.919
Sit.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.234
Impressive.

28:51.400 --> 28:53.392
You got the FBI on your payroll.

28:53.560 --> 28:56.075
They deliver me right to you,
no questions asked.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.470
I was thinking about that...

28:59.640 --> 29:02.917
...poor soul whose eye you stole.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.158
What a shame.

29:05.320 --> 29:09.394
Disfigured for life,
caught up in all this nastiness.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.957
Wasn't my decision.
Take it up with the lady who hired me.

29:13.120 --> 29:16.158
Mr. Kaplan.
I will when you tell me where to find her.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.879
You're nuts.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.918
I know about your immunity deal.

29:20.080 --> 29:22.595
That means I'm dead
no matter what I tell you.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.558
Ratting Kaplan out gets me nothing.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.313
She had you steal that agreement.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.279
You must have had a plan
to bring it to her.

29:30.160 --> 29:33.756
You can tell me where and when,
or you can tell him.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.833
One way or another, the truth will out.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.273
We don't know each other...

29:40.440 --> 29:44.354
...so I'll forgive you for not knowing
that I don't scare easily.

29:44.800 --> 29:47.554
I expect to die here today.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.480
That's the end of your leverage, but...

29:50.680 --> 29:52.273
There's a but.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.559
Please. Do go on.

29:57.960 --> 30:00.191
If you wanna negotiate...

30:00.400 --> 30:02.756
...I might be willing to help.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.515
I can deliver her to you.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.469
In exchange for what?

30:11.160 --> 30:12.560
<i>Yeah. I got it.</i>

30:12.720 --> 30:13.790
Any problems?

30:14.560 --> 30:16.631
Nothing unexpected.

30:16.800 --> 30:20.794
But anybody holding this thing is a target.
I don't wanna keep it any longer.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.480
I can meet you later today.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.473
We're all set.

30:29.680 --> 30:32.195
I'll serve her up on a silver platter...

30:32.360 --> 30:35.432
...if you hold up your end of the deal.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.993
<i>You got Dixon to talk. How?</i>

30:39.160 --> 30:41.595
You know what, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

30:41.760 --> 30:43.911
- Didn't touch him.
- He told you how to find Kaplan?

30:44.080 --> 30:47.471
Yes. Southwest Waterfront. Five p.m.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.757
She'll be there to take the agreement.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.673
Five doesn't give us much time.

30:51.840 --> 30:55.038
Then you'll have to hurry.
I'll be in touch as soon as I know more.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.351
What about Dixon?
Our people should wire him up.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.671
<i>They'll have time before the meet.
I have to go.</i>

30:59.840 --> 31:03.277
Go where? There's something wrong.
I can hear it in your voice.

31:03.440 --> 31:06.672
<i>- Where are you going?
- I have to take care of something.</i>

31:07.040 --> 31:08.554
Five o'clock.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.991
The war ends tonight.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.480
This is a mistake.

31:24.360 --> 31:25.510
Perhaps.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.956
Your purpose is to protect Elizabeth.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.680
But mine is to protect you.

31:30.840 --> 31:34.675
If things get very bad,
this will make that impossible.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.678
Hello, Dom.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.592
What do you want?

31:46.880 --> 31:48.633
You told me never to open this.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.594
- Yes. Without me.
- That's not what you said.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.156
I'm old, but I'm not that old.

31:54.760 --> 31:58.151
You said this was for emergency only.
The last resort.

31:58.320 --> 32:01.472
- If you opened this, it would mean...
- I know what it means.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.396
What is it, Raymond? What's happened?

32:05.560 --> 32:07.711
I'm under attack, Dom.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.952
Most of my business has been destroyed.
Many of my people killed.

32:11.120 --> 32:12.474
Mother of God.

32:12.640 --> 32:15.872
Fight back.
That's what you do with it. You fight.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.394
I'm trying.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.120
But regardless, this isn't for me.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.795
I don't understand.
You're just giving this away?

32:23.000 --> 32:24.150
Why would you do that?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.834
For Masha.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.596
She's alive, Dom.

32:31.800 --> 32:34.759
I thought we lost her once.
I won't lose her again.

32:40.880 --> 32:42.280
Unbelievable.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.040
Dom, will you wait?
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.270
Like you care.

32:46.480 --> 32:50.315
Like you're even capable of considering
anyone else's feelings but your own.

32:50.480 --> 32:51.914
That's not fair.

32:52.080 --> 32:55.710
Masha's alive.
My granddaughter is alive.

32:55.880 --> 32:58.475
How long have you known?
How long have you let me sit...

32:58.640 --> 33:00.313
...thinking that she was...

33:00.480 --> 33:02.472
You told me she was dead.
How could you lie?

33:02.640 --> 33:04.597
I wasn't lying.

33:04.960 --> 33:09.034
When I told you Masha was gone,
I believed she had died in childbirth.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.317
She deceived me.
Faked her own death.

33:11.480 --> 33:14.518
At the time,
she wanted to get away from me.

33:14.720 --> 33:16.040
So do I.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.040
She had help from one of my people.

33:23.200 --> 33:26.079
A woman close to me
who betrayed my trust.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.075
Dom, I know you've been conditioned
to assume my selfishness.

33:32.280 --> 33:35.637
I'm sure that's largely my fault,
but this is different.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.031
This woman, she's made it her mission...

33:38.240 --> 33:42.120
...to eliminate me, to remove me
from Masha's life whatever the cost.

33:42.280 --> 33:46.911
The truth is, she's proven to be adept
at killing the people closest to me.

33:47.080 --> 33:50.312
She knows everything about my operation.
I kept her at my side for years.

33:50.480 --> 33:53.234
But the one thing
she doesn't know is you.

33:53.400 --> 33:57.713
I haven't told you about Masha
because I didn't wanna risk coming here.

33:57.880 --> 34:01.271
Or making contact with you again
until this fight was over.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.160
- I'm supposed to say thanks?
- Don't have to say anything.

34:04.320 --> 34:07.631
You don't have to believe me or help me
or like me. You never have.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.076
I don't know why you'd have to start now.

34:10.639 --> 34:13.074
But this isn't about me, Dom.

34:13.639 --> 34:15.120
This is about Masha.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.870
- If I don't come back...
- You always come back.

34:20.199 --> 34:22.476
If I don't come back...

34:23.080 --> 34:25.197
...you need to find her, Dom.

34:25.719 --> 34:27.837
Tell her who you are.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.793
Raymond.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.678
I have to go.

34:39.199 --> 34:40.839
I'm sorry.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.475
For what?

34:42.679 --> 34:43.830
All of it.

34:45.600 --> 34:49.799
I wish I'd been the person
you wanted me to be.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.556
Mr. Cooper,
can I talk to you for a second?

35:01.720 --> 35:03.200
Not now.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.556
- Tactical's in place?
- Waiting on our command.

35:05.720 --> 35:07.996
Where's our asset?
Reddington should be here.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.799
I'll call him.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.600
<i>- Elizabeth.
- You're supposed to be here with Dixon.</i>

35:15.800 --> 35:17.757
Our meeting with Kaplan's
in less than an hour.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.594
<i>I'll be taking that meeting alone.</i>

35:23.480 --> 35:25.836
You lied about the location.

35:26.000 --> 35:30.040
<i>- You're gonna kill her.
- I don't know what the outcome will be.</i>

35:30.640 --> 35:32.996
I asked you not to do this.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.436
You asked if I could promise you
that I wouldn't.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.193
I said, no.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.719
That was Dembe.

35:46.880 --> 35:50.237
- He said he can't find Reddington.
- What do you mean, he can't find him?

35:50.400 --> 35:53.359
If we don't show up with Dixon,
our whole operation's blown.

35:53.520 --> 35:55.273
Where the hell is he?

36:04.920 --> 36:06.479
Where did Kaplan tell you to meet?

36:06.680 --> 36:08.592
Where's what you promised me?

36:10.040 --> 36:11.190
A box.

36:11.360 --> 36:15.832
I'm supposed to believe my escape plan
and my future survival fits into a box?

36:16.000 --> 36:17.434
This is no mere box.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.910
Inside you'll find travel vouchers...

36:21.080 --> 36:23.436
...security codes, boat keys...

36:23.600 --> 36:29.232
...and ownership papers for a private
96-acre island off the coast of Brunei.

36:29.400 --> 36:33.519
It's a self-sufficient turnkey property
with a desalination well...

36:33.680 --> 36:36.752
...a solar and wind farm,
full-time wait staff...

36:36.960 --> 36:40.397
...grounds crew, security team,
and a property manager...

36:40.560 --> 36:44.349
...all paid for in perpetuity
by a very healthy trust fund.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.113
Paradise.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.237
With no extradition treaty.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.791
And what's to prevent you from kicking
me off this island once I move in?

36:52.960 --> 36:55.520
Right now,
the island's owner is legend.

36:55.680 --> 36:58.354
Nobody on the island knows
who it belongs to.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.319
All they know is, that one day...

37:01.480 --> 37:07.112
...someone will arrive with a key that fits
into an old lock on the front door.

37:07.280 --> 37:10.830
Whosoever opens that lock
with this key...

37:11.040 --> 37:13.191
...the staff will loyally serve...

37:13.360 --> 37:17.877
...and the guards will forever defend
against all comers.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.197
The location of the meeting.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.597
Falstaff Theater on M Street.
Two miles from here.

37:30.760 --> 37:33.514
Kaplan expects me in 20 minutes.

37:40.200 --> 37:44.080
The box is actually intended
for someone else.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.397
If it's not about locating Reddington...

37:56.560 --> 37:58.233
- It's not but...
- It'll have to wait.

37:58.400 --> 38:02.474
Sir, I've been subpoenaed
to testify in front of a grand jury.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.872
Not supposed to tell you because
you're a target of the investigation.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.474
- Me?
- Everyone.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.991
Julian Gale's convinced the U.S. Attorney
that we've broken the law.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.391
Sir, he's coming after us.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.319
All of us.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.438
Mario?

38:32.240 --> 38:33.799
Weapons.

38:39.720 --> 38:40.995
Hello, Kate.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.793
- Raymond.
- I have to hand it to you. You did it.

38:46.320 --> 38:48.596
My associates, my accounts...

38:49.120 --> 38:50.474
...cash reserves...

38:50.680 --> 38:52.433
...gone.

38:52.640 --> 38:56.031
About the only thing you left me
is the hat on my head.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.320
And this.

38:59.360 --> 39:00.999
The way out.

39:01.160 --> 39:02.913
The island.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.273
Too many killings, Kate.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.352
On all sides.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.236
I don't want more death.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.595
And neither do you.

39:13.760 --> 39:16.116
I simply want this to end.

39:17.320 --> 39:19.471
You can have the island.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.396
- To be my prison.
- Yes.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.278
In paradise.

39:25.440 --> 39:27.750
Elizabeth is who she is, Kate.

39:28.240 --> 39:33.190
She's not Masha anymore. With little
to none of my presence or influence...

39:33.360 --> 39:38.116
...through the years, she has grown up
to be Special Agent Elizabeth Keen.

39:38.280 --> 39:42.718
Her area of scholarship and expertise
is the study of criminals.

39:42.880 --> 39:46.396
The habits and inclinations,
the curiosities and proclivities...

39:46.560 --> 39:48.711
...the psychiatry of criminals.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.712
That's who she is.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.436
That may be the world she was born to...

39:55.600 --> 40:00.197
...but it is most certainly
the world she has chosen to live in.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.959
I can continue to...

40:03.120 --> 40:07.080
...give her more distance, but she is
going to continue to be who she is.

40:07.240 --> 40:10.278
And I'm not going
to stop watching out for her.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.320
So...

40:12.480 --> 40:15.837
...either you go and save yourself...

40:16.480 --> 40:19.154
...or this ends right here.

40:19.520 --> 40:21.193
Now.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.317
I'm not going anywhere, Raymond.

40:24.520 --> 40:28.309
So you better make sure
you finish the job this time.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.871
For both our sakes.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.240
FBI! Drop your weapon!

40:46.680 --> 40:49.354
- How'd he find us?
- Kate must have made a deal.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.475
Reddington's got
the immunity agreement. Call this in.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.393
What about Kaplan?

41:20.960 --> 41:23.236
- You didn't run.
- Run?

41:23.400 --> 41:26.552
Just standing here makes my head flare.

41:27.080 --> 41:29.675
I'm sorry I failed to deliver
on my promise to you.

41:29.880 --> 41:32.475
Raymond must've intercepted
the immunity agreement...

41:32.640 --> 41:34.199
...or perhaps the task force did.

41:34.360 --> 41:37.671
- It doesn't matter.
- No, no. It does matter, lady.

41:37.840 --> 41:41.038
I needed that document
to prove that Keen, Ressler...

41:41.200 --> 41:43.556
...and I don't know who else in the FBI...

41:43.720 --> 41:46.918
...enabled Reddington to grow and profit
from a criminal empire.

41:47.080 --> 41:51.472
The date on that agreement, that was
my smoking gun to bring them down.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.838
So, yeah, it does matter.
Because without it, I've got nothing.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.195
Wrong.

41:56.720 --> 41:58.677
You have me.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.630
Raymond thinks
he outmaneuvered me today.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.917
But he underestimated my commitment.

42:04.120 --> 42:06.954
I've been his cleaner, keeper...

42:07.120 --> 42:09.271
...and confessor for 30 years.

42:09.440 --> 42:12.831
And I'm prepared to tell you everything
you need to know.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.833
In open court.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.519
In exchange for immunity.

42:18.720 --> 42:19.836
Yes.

42:20.320 --> 42:24.075
So maybe we should get on with it
and you should arrest me.
