ADAM: Wright knows the tech

00:43.173 --> 00:45.567

millions, so he hires a team

00:45.610 --> 00:47.177

wipe them,

00:47.221 --> 00:49.571

You know what?

11:16.023 --> 11:18.155
I really think
you did the right thing.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.723
Hating someone is so easy.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.204
It's a lot, it's a lot harder
to forgive.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.727
Not that I would know.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.860
Yeah, remind me
not to get on your bad side.

11:28.775 --> 11:32.039
Look, um,
just give your dad some time.

11:32.082 --> 11:33.431
Think he'll come around.

11:34.955 --> 11:36.913
Yes, I hope you're right.

11:38.915 --> 11:41.135
[knocking on glass]Yo.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.050
Wait, let me guess,

11:43.093 --> 11:45.269
this is your daily request
for more fieldwork?

11:45.313 --> 11:49.186
Actually, no. I just got
a very strange phone call.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.710
Yeah? Who from?

11:50.753 --> 11:52.059
The wife of Omar Hassan.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.757
Mm-hmm. What'd she want?

11:54.801 --> 11:56.063
To apologize.

11:56.106 --> 11:57.717
For her husband

11:57.760 --> 12:00.241
sending those guys to kill Joe
and the rest of the SEAL team.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.546
She wants to ask
your forgiveness

12:01.590 --> 12:03.418
on behalf of her family.

12:03.461 --> 12:05.725
Well, it's been
over five months,

12:05.768 --> 12:07.639
so why is she asking now?I don't know.

12:07.683 --> 12:10.599
But she also asked
if she could bring her son,

12:10.642 --> 12:13.776
because she wants him
to be here to see it.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.822
[phone ringing]

12:22.742 --> 12:25.309
Yeah, okay. Have them come in.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.531
[door opens]

12:30.924 --> 12:32.926
Duke, what's up?

12:35.450 --> 12:37.931
LUKELA:
Victim is Bryson Kahele.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.323
His girlfriend came
to check on him

12:39.367 --> 12:40.455
when he wasn't
answering his phone.

12:40.498 --> 12:41.761
She found him like this.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.895
M.E.'s already determined
it was a poisoning.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.028
VX nerve agent, to be specific.

12:48.071 --> 12:49.769
STEVE: Okay, you
said this homicide

12:49.812 --> 12:52.293
could be connected
to Aaron Wright somehow.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.642
How so?LUKELA:
Kahele was already

12:53.685 --> 12:55.949
on the HPD
cyber crime unit radar.

12:55.992 --> 12:58.647
Apparently, he was a big deal
in the local hacking community.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.083
Given the timing,
we figured

13:00.127 --> 13:01.824
the murder might
be related to Wright.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.478
DANNY:
Well, it's cold-blooded,

13:03.521 --> 13:05.523
needlessly sadistic, high-tech.

13:05.567 --> 13:08.483
Yeah, it certainly feels like
one of Wright's greatest hits.

13:08.526 --> 13:09.527
JERRY: Hey, I got something.

13:12.704 --> 13:14.837
MAN: Go ahead and cover.Say cheese.

13:18.841 --> 13:19.973
Okay.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.322
Okay, that's us.

13:21.365 --> 13:23.324
There's a camera
in here somewhere.

13:23.367 --> 13:24.455
Over there.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.637
Good. Keep going,
keep going,

13:32.681 --> 13:34.030
keep going,
keep going.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.510
Is that it?

13:35.553 --> 13:37.164
Must be hidden in this charger.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.861
That's a little too close.

13:38.905 --> 13:42.647
Hey, Jerry, check the recording
history of this thing.

13:43.735 --> 13:44.998
Yeah, I'm on it.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.695
I'm pulling up footage
from the past 24 hours.

13:49.741 --> 13:51.178
I got something.

13:51.221 --> 13:54.181
And... time's up.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.530
STEVE:
Yeah,

13:55.573 --> 13:57.445
that's our boy.Hey.

13:57.488 --> 13:59.882
The deal is on.
Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.363
I'll text you the details.

14:02.406 --> 14:04.408
2:00 p.m., that's like
three hours from now.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.889
Okay. So we're
officially on the clock.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.935
Now we need to find Wright
before he sells these weapons.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.589
It's hard to imagine the extent
of the damage they could do.

14:11.633 --> 14:12.895
No pressure.

14:19.815 --> 14:20.990
STEVE: All right, so
here's what we know.

14:21.034 --> 14:22.339
Aaron Wright is in possession

14:22.383 --> 14:24.907
of NSA cyber weapons
which he intends to sell.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.866
Transaction will go down
at 2:00 p.m. today,

14:26.909 --> 14:29.172
which gives us a little
over two hours to find him.

14:29.216 --> 14:31.000
DANNY: Okay, and then
there's what we don't know,

14:31.044 --> 14:32.393
which is where the
sale's going down

14:32.436 --> 14:33.829
and who it is being sold to.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.700
I bet it's not anybody
you'd want to invite over

14:35.744 --> 14:37.702
for Christmas dinner.
We know it's someone looking

14:37.746 --> 14:40.357
to take down an entire country's
defense system,

14:40.401 --> 14:42.359
but unfortunately, that
doesn't narrow it down much.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.927
Adam's right. It could be
any number of backsliders:

14:44.971 --> 14:46.929
a terror group,
nation state...

14:46.973 --> 14:48.278
TANI: I've been combing
through the arrivals

14:48.322 --> 14:49.453
from ports
and airports,

14:49.497 --> 14:50.715
but there's no indication
that anyone

14:50.759 --> 14:52.108
who was on some sort
of security watch list

14:52.152 --> 14:53.805
has made their way
to the island.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.590
JUNIOR: We also have every law
enforcement agency scouring

14:55.633 --> 14:57.766
the island for Wright.
Still nothing.

14:57.809 --> 15:00.725
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what.
If we don't find him quick,

15:00.769 --> 15:03.728
you can kiss
his slippery ass goodbye.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.339
The minute
he sells those cyber weapons

15:05.382 --> 15:07.341
and gets his cash, he's out.

15:07.384 --> 15:10.387
Jerry, please tell me
you got a lead on Aaron Wright.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.998
More like a lead ona lead.

15:12.041 --> 15:14.304
Uh-huh.So, I've been reviewing
the hidden camera footage

15:14.348 --> 15:16.306
from his accomplice's loft,
and take a look.

15:17.481 --> 15:18.439
Okay, this is Wright

15:18.482 --> 15:20.658
placing the call to his buyer.

15:20.702 --> 15:23.444
I was able to enhance the audio,
and using the unique frequencies

15:23.487 --> 15:26.273
of the keypad tones,
determined the number he dialed.

15:26.316 --> 15:27.839
STEVE: All right, great.
Why don't we

15:27.883 --> 15:29.667
ping that phone
for a location? No?Uh...

15:29.711 --> 15:31.234
DANNY: I'm pretty
sure that's a "no."

15:31.278 --> 15:34.107
Yeah. Sorry. It came back
as an encrypted phone.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.195
And you can't
crack it?

15:35.238 --> 15:36.674
A man knows his
limitations.

15:36.718 --> 15:37.762
This is a little

15:37.806 --> 15:39.155
above my pay grade.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.374
Damn, Jerry.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.376
Well, we got new
friends at the NSA.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.768
Hell, let's call them.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.379
Yes. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, that's the move.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.250
I'll make a call, they'll be
able to crack the encryption,

15:47.294 --> 15:49.687
get us the text that Wright sent
to his buyers which included[phone ringing]

15:49.731 --> 15:50.950
The location, right?

15:50.993 --> 15:53.691
Ah, sorry. I got to take this.
[clears throat]

15:53.735 --> 15:55.476
ADAM: Meantime, I'll alert
SWAT and HPD.Mom.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.521
Have them on standby.JUNIOR:
Hey, it's okay. Calm down.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.741
Calm down.ADAM: We'll need to move fast.

15:59.784 --> 16:02.091
STEVE: Good idea.All right, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.137
Hang tight. Bye.

16:05.399 --> 16:07.009
You all right?
Yeah.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.228
What was that about?

16:08.271 --> 16:10.230
Nothing.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.058
Well, you're obviously
not all right, Joons.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.407
Tell us what's going on.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.453
Uh, it's my dad.

16:16.497 --> 16:17.889
My mom doesn't know where he is,

16:17.933 --> 16:19.630
and she can't get
in touch with him.

16:19.674 --> 16:21.154
She's really worried.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.243
We got this. Go find Pops.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.592
Thank you.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.291
STEVE:
Okay.

16:28.335 --> 16:29.858
I'm gonna make that call.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.005
[camera clicking]

16:47.658 --> 16:49.356
All right, heads up.
Heads up.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.705
Buyers are on site.

16:54.926 --> 16:56.406
[camera clicking]

17:00.584 --> 17:03.065
Jerry, I'm sending
you the photos now.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.633
Copy that.
Running facial rec now.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.467
Okay, here we go.
You got eyes on Monica Felix.

17:13.510 --> 17:16.773
She's got
a pretty extensive rap sheet.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.906
All major league crimes,
including

17:18.950 --> 17:20.952
gunrunning
and human trafficking.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.214
She definitely has the contacts

17:22.258 --> 17:24.217
to get these weapons
in the wrong hands.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.695
It looks like she's made FBI

17:25.740 --> 17:27.742
and Interpol's Most Wanted list.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.962
Popular lady.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.008
[tires screeching]

17:35.402 --> 17:36.838
Everybody stay sharp.

17:36.881 --> 17:39.014
Nobody moves
until we get eyes on Wright.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.151
Okay, got him.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.112
STEVE:
Five-O!

17:50.156 --> 17:53.202
Hands! Hands!
All of your hands right now.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.508
Hands where we
can see 'em.

17:54.551 --> 17:56.597
That's right. Don't move!

17:56.640 --> 17:57.815
Aaron Wright,
get on your knees

17:57.859 --> 17:59.426
right now.
On your knees.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.471
Hands behind your head.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.606
Look, look, I don't know
what the hell's going on.

18:05.649 --> 18:07.347
Some guy just gave me five Gs
to show up here and hand over

18:07.390 --> 18:09.044
this bag.Stop! Stop!

18:09.088 --> 18:11.394
What's in the bag?I-I don't know.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.135
The deal was to deliver it,
no questions asked.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.705
Back. Back!

18:20.011 --> 18:22.231
[shouting]

18:22.275 --> 18:24.668
[glass shattering]

18:48.127 --> 18:50.129
[indistinct chatter]

18:52.000 --> 18:53.219
Hey.

18:53.262 --> 18:55.177
You guys all right?

18:55.221 --> 18:56.613
I'm fine,
but look at this poor guy.

18:56.657 --> 18:57.919
He lost all his hair
in the explosion.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.094
What happened to your eyebrows?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.443
What do you mean?

19:00.487 --> 19:01.749
Hey, guys,
just spoke to CSU.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.272
Apparently, that briefcase
contained roughly

19:03.316 --> 19:06.319
$30 million
worth of Eurobonds.

19:06.362 --> 19:07.407
GROVER:
That's a very

19:07.450 --> 19:09.148
expensive explosion.

19:09.191 --> 19:11.411
Okay, Wright had to have known
we were up on this deal.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.282
So rather than call it off,
he sets this trap.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.458
And blows up all his own money?

19:15.502 --> 19:17.286
You know,
knowing him,

19:17.330 --> 19:20.289
this is probably a stunt
to distract us

19:20.333 --> 19:21.464
while he's making
his escape

19:21.508 --> 19:22.596
from the island right now.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.598
No. No way.
There's no way

19:24.641 --> 19:25.947
he's walking away from this
without getting paid,

19:25.990 --> 19:27.470
not after all this risk.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.820
Look, if we know Aaron Wright,

19:29.864 --> 19:31.996
we know he has
a contingency plan.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.260
I'm thinking he has
a backup buyer in place.

19:34.303 --> 19:37.132
[line ringing]Okay, fair enough,
but that doesn't answer

19:37.176 --> 19:38.481
the bigger question, which is,

19:38.525 --> 19:40.614
how the hell did he know
we were gonna be here?

19:40.657 --> 19:41.963
STEVE: We need to see if
Jerry's got anything.

19:42.006 --> 19:43.660
JERRY: Commander.Hey.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.314
Uh, it pains me

19:45.358 --> 19:46.837
to have to tell you this,

19:46.881 --> 19:49.449
but at some point
when Wright was here,

19:49.492 --> 19:52.321
he implanted spyware
on my computer.

19:52.365 --> 19:53.496
I just discovered it.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.063
Don't tell me.

19:55.106 --> 19:57.892
He didn't just get
your Spotify playlist.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.198
I wish that were the case.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.547
He installed a keystroke logger

20:00.590 --> 20:02.810
and advanced system monitoring.

20:02.853 --> 20:05.726
He basically turned my laptop
into a listening device.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.380
So Wright's been up
on all Five-O comms,

20:07.423 --> 20:08.990
knows everything
we've been up to,

20:09.033 --> 20:11.166
where any of us are at any time?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.212
Yeah. Sorry about that.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.735
I should have caught it sooner.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.998
Um, we all know
what Wright's capable of, Jerry.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.740
All right, well, thanks. I guess
we have no idea where he is.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.226
Password?

20:27.269 --> 20:28.879
You'll get it when
I have my money.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.537
Transferring now.

20:35.973 --> 20:37.410
[phone chirps]

20:37.453 --> 20:39.150
And there it is.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.935
Funds have been transferred.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.895
What?

20:44.939 --> 20:47.115
You try memorizing
42 characters.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.784
Nice doing business with you.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.220
Likewise.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.656
Do me one favor?

21:06.700 --> 21:07.918
What's that?

21:07.962 --> 21:09.485
Maybe wait till
I get off this rock

21:09.529 --> 21:10.834
before you launch
World War III?

21:15.839 --> 21:18.538
[engine starts, revs]

21:27.895 --> 21:29.331
Yeah, Tani, what's up?

21:29.375 --> 21:31.072
Hey, I'm here with Jerry.
We're trying to get a bead

21:31.115 --> 21:32.552
on Wright's location.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.641
So, we know that he was
in contact with our dead hacker,

21:34.684 --> 21:36.991
Bryson Kahele,
as recently

21:37.034 --> 21:39.036
as last night, so we looked
into Kahele's phone records.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.386
And?

21:40.429 --> 21:42.301
JERRY:
And using his recent

21:42.344 --> 21:44.390
incoming calls, we
managed to I.D. the burner

21:44.433 --> 21:46.000
that Wright used
to contact him.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.001
DANNY:
And let me guess.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.959
He dumped that phone, right?

21:49.003 --> 21:50.265
Well, your pessimism
is well placed,

21:50.309 --> 21:51.353
but it wasn't
a complete dead end.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.441
Yeah, lucky for us,

21:52.485 --> 21:53.921
we were able to trace that phone

21:53.964 --> 21:55.662
back to the store
where Wright bought it,

21:55.705 --> 21:58.099
and it turns out
he likes to buy in bulk.

21:58.142 --> 22:01.189
The burner he used last
night is one of seven

22:01.232 --> 22:03.713
that Wright purchased at the
cell phone store in Kaimuki.

22:03.757 --> 22:05.411
Smart. He keeps
cycling through burners

22:05.454 --> 22:07.021
like that, we'll never get
a bead on him.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.414
How does any of this
help us find him?

22:08.457 --> 22:09.763
JERRY:
Well,

22:09.806 --> 22:11.895
we now have several weeks of
cell phone records

22:11.939 --> 22:13.114
from each of these phones

22:13.157 --> 22:15.682
and one number
keeps popping up.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.510
TANI:
So up until

22:17.553 --> 22:19.468
pretty recently,
he was in contact

22:19.512 --> 22:21.731
with a local named
Lindsay Acosta.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.255
She's 25, she has
no criminal record.

22:24.299 --> 22:25.474
Also no ties to intelligence

22:25.518 --> 22:26.910
or the hacking communities.

22:26.954 --> 22:29.173
Okay, well, what's
Wright's interest in her?

22:29.217 --> 22:32.612
Well... I'll tell you what
his interest in her could be.

22:32.655 --> 22:34.701
Wright's been on the island
for a couple months.

22:34.744 --> 22:37.268
I'm willing to bet that
he was seeing the girl.

22:37.312 --> 22:39.488
Okay, bring her in.

22:41.925 --> 22:44.363
What's this about?
Have I done something wrong?

22:44.406 --> 22:45.799
You know this guy.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.193
That wasn't a question.
We know you know him.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.500
Sorry. It's just
a little surprising.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.415
Yes, that's... Drew.

22:53.459 --> 22:54.721
We were dating.

22:54.764 --> 22:56.505
Is he in trouble?

22:56.549 --> 22:58.159
Yes. Yes, he is.

22:58.202 --> 22:59.421
But, uh, we'll
get to that.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.422
JERRY: You said
you weredating.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.206
So it didn't work out?

23:02.250 --> 23:03.947
No.

23:03.991 --> 23:06.385
He broke it off two weeks ago.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.822
Which wasn't exactly surprising.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.390
He was always...
pretty secretive.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.741
I got the sense
he had something else going on.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.960
Mm-hmm. When you
say "secretive,"

23:17.004 --> 23:18.701
what do you mean by that?He would go days

23:18.745 --> 23:20.181
without returning my calls.

23:20.224 --> 23:24.054
He'd tell me he couldn't see me,
but when I asked why...

23:24.098 --> 23:26.579
I got the feeling
he wasn't telling me the truth.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.758
I'm kind of ashamed
to tell you this, but...

23:31.801 --> 23:34.064
one night I left
my phone in his car.

23:34.108 --> 23:36.980
You know, to track
where he was going,

23:37.024 --> 23:38.895
see if he was cheating on me.

23:38.939 --> 23:41.898
That's excellent tradecraft.

23:41.942 --> 23:43.944
TANI:
What did you find?

23:43.987 --> 23:44.988
That's just it.

23:45.032 --> 23:46.773
There was no other woman.

23:46.816 --> 23:47.991
Well...

23:48.035 --> 23:49.906
that time, at least.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.865
He just went
to some storage place
