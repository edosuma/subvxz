WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:01.436
<i>Previously, on "The Ark"...</i>

00:06.049 --> 00:08.356
- I need answers.
- Will any of this work
on Prox B?

00:08.356 --> 00:11.446
It'’ll have different soil,
which means different vegetation.

00:11.446 --> 00:14.101
Then you'’re the most
important man on this ship.

00:14.101 --> 00:18.496
- The hull of that attacking
ship said Ark 15?
- That'’s who attacked us?

00:18.496 --> 00:21.456
- I know where Ark 15 is.
- It goes straight to Proxima B.

00:21.456 --> 00:24.067
We'’re running straight
towards the ship
that tried to kill us.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.721
Can I count on you
to stand by my side

00:25.721 --> 00:27.766
- no matter what happens?
- Of course you can.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.203
After what they did to me,

00:29.203 --> 00:30.726
my only remaining loyalty
lies with you.

00:30.726 --> 00:33.337
Have more water.

00:33.337 --> 00:35.687
Thank you.

00:35.687 --> 00:37.733
What did you do?

00:41.215 --> 00:43.739
It is my reluctant obligation
to take command of Ark 1,

00:43.739 --> 00:46.872
and my first order
is that we resume our mission
to Proxima B.

00:46.872 --> 00:51.703
- Are you okay?
- I don'’t want to hear anything
that you have to say.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.054
There'’s a ship approaching.
That'’s Ark 15.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.708
Ark 15, I have him.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.515
You'’re coming with me,
Mr. Trust.

01:20.515 --> 01:23.039
- He'’s not going
anywhere with you.
- Listen, young lady.

01:23.039 --> 01:26.825
You don'’t have to do this.
Let'’s just talk it out, hmm?

01:26.825 --> 01:29.089
Why don'’t you hand me
the gun, sweetheart?

01:29.089 --> 01:32.179
- No.
- You don'’t want to hurt anyone.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.268
You'’re right, I don't.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.053
But I will.

01:47.672 --> 01:49.283
Anyone else?

02:27.669 --> 02:29.105
Why aren'’t
they shooting at us?

02:29.105 --> 02:31.890
That is a very good question

02:31.890 --> 02:33.109
considering they'’re the ones

02:33.109 --> 02:35.372
who shot and trashed
our cryo pod bays.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.418
And killed everyone on Ark 3.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.898
This is Lieutenant
Sharon Garnet of Ark 1.

02:39.898 --> 02:41.900
Ark 15, what are
your intentions?

02:48.124 --> 02:53.129
- Ark 15, please respond.
- What the hell are they up to?

03:00.963 --> 03:03.792
- They'’re launching a shuttle.
- Why would they do that?

03:03.792 --> 03:05.663
It might be a boarding party.

03:05.663 --> 03:09.145
Attention, Ark 15 shuttle,
what are your intentions?

03:11.756 --> 03:14.716
Ark 15 shuttle,
inform us of your
intentions or turn back.

03:14.716 --> 03:19.242
Or what? We don'’t have any
weapons to defend ourselves.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.505
Eva, how long until we can jump
to faster than light?

03:21.505 --> 03:23.681
82 minutes to charge.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.293
Can we lock down
the shuttle hatch
so they can'’t get in?

03:26.293 --> 03:27.468
I could torch-weld it.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.557
Get someone else to do it.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.254
Look, for all we know
she'’s on their side.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.909
Really?

03:33.909 --> 03:35.345
Go do it, Eva.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.915
I'’ll keep an eye on her.

03:39.915 --> 03:42.352
I'’ll organize some
sort of defense.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.441
- I'’ll come along.
- No, you stay here.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.356
- Why?
- Because I no longer trust you.

03:46.356 --> 03:48.706
- What? Why?
- Why? Seriously?

03:48.706 --> 03:50.578
- You participated in a coup.
- I made a wrong decision.

03:50.578 --> 03:52.884
I do not have time
for this right now.
You stay here!

03:52.884 --> 03:55.800
You need all the help--
I'’m sorry.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.240
Frankly, I don'’t want much
to do with you either, Griff.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.850
The only reason
you'’re not locked up

04:01.850 --> 04:03.634
is because you let us out
when it mattered.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.290
I understand.

04:12.991 --> 04:16.168
Attention all personnel,
this is Lieutenant Garnet.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.780
<i>We believe Ark 1
is about to be boarded</i>

04:18.780 --> 04:20.347
<i>by personnel from Ark 15.</i>

04:20.347 --> 04:22.610
<i>We can'’t be sure
they'’re hostile,</i>

04:22.610 --> 04:24.699
<i>but due to the lack
of response to our hails,</i>

04:24.699 --> 04:27.005
we are assuming they are,

04:27.005 --> 04:28.659
which means
they are probably armed.

04:28.659 --> 04:31.749
For this reason, I am ordering
a shipwide lockdown.

04:31.749 --> 04:34.926
<i>All crew, unless you are part
of the security detail,</i>

04:34.926 --> 04:36.580
are to seal your bulkheads,

04:36.580 --> 04:38.147
<i>barricade, and prepare
to defend yourselves</i>

04:38.147 --> 04:40.323
<i>until otherwise ordered.</i>

04:52.596 --> 04:53.423
Where'’s the guard?

04:55.991 --> 04:57.427
Guard, you in there?

05:00.996 --> 05:03.825
Oh, good, Angus.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.392
You saved me from having
to come find you.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.263
Come on in.
Join the party.

05:07.263 --> 05:10.310
Thank you, but I'’m not in
a party mood right now. Okay.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.876
Okay, I'’m coming in. I'll--

05:17.229 --> 05:19.449
Lieutenant Lane,
you want me to set that for you?

05:19.449 --> 05:21.408
- What?
- Don'’t try anything

05:21.408 --> 05:22.409
or I'’ll have to pull
the trigger.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.674
This will only hurt
for a second.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.069
So much better.
You'’re welcome.

05:31.069 --> 05:33.594
Kelly, what are you doing?

05:33.594 --> 05:35.160
I was setting
Lieutenant Lane'’s nose.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.860
But did you kill that guard?
Did you shoot Mrs. Trust?

05:38.860 --> 05:40.470
- Calm down.
- How can I calm down?

05:40.470 --> 05:41.993
There'’s a dead person there
and another one dying!

05:41.993 --> 05:44.213
Kelly, can I make
a suggestion?

05:44.213 --> 05:47.216
Why don'’t you let Cat
and Angus just take
Mrs. Trust to the med bay?

05:47.216 --> 05:49.653
Mr. Trust and I will stay here.
He'’s who you want anyway.

05:49.653 --> 05:51.655
- I can'’t do that.
- Why not?

05:51.655 --> 05:53.875
Well, for one,
I want Angus with me.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.443
- Why?
- Because you'’re important.

05:56.443 --> 05:58.140
- I need you.
- What?

05:58.140 --> 05:59.794
Well, what about me?

05:59.794 --> 06:01.056
Let me take her to get
the medical help she needs.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.405
Why, so you can alert
everyone else?

06:02.405 --> 06:04.102
I won'’t tell anyone.
I won'’t.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.235
Yeah, right.
She has a bullet in her.

06:06.235 --> 06:07.976
I think people
will figure it out.

06:07.976 --> 06:09.630
But she'’s bleeding out.
She'’ll die.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.546
I'’m sorry.
I really didn'’t want
to hurt anyone.

06:12.546 --> 06:15.287
I swear, I didn'’t,
but she shouldn'’t
have come at me.

06:15.287 --> 06:16.332
It'’s her own fault.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.296
- Can you go any faster?
- No.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.214
- Nice sword.
- Yeah. Long story.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.043
They'’re docking.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.839
- Hurry up.
- I'’m moving as fast as I can.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.275
Yeah, well, move faster!

06:46.275 --> 06:48.103
I know you'’re mad at me,
but now is not the time.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.627
Damn straight,
I am mad at you.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.542
- You drugged me.
- I did it for you!

06:52.542 --> 06:57.373
You wouldn'’t have lived long
enough to make it to Ross 128!

06:57.373 --> 06:58.940
Wait. Go, go. Now.
They'’re here, go!

06:58.940 --> 07:00.202
Go, go!

07:03.074 --> 07:04.728
We don'’t want to hurt
anyone until we'’re sure
they'’re hostile.

07:06.948 --> 07:10.647
Are you kidding?

07:10.647 --> 07:12.823
They'’re armed. Take cover!

07:12.823 --> 07:15.043
Everyone, get down!

07:15.043 --> 07:17.959
They'’re wearing body armor
and carrying automatic weapons,

07:17.959 --> 07:22.180
- so clearly they do not
come in peace.
- You think?

07:22.180 --> 07:25.183
It'’s five so far.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.968
- What did you just do?
- Call me a dreamer,

07:26.968 --> 07:28.448
but first I have to try this.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.930
We'’re friendly!
Put down your weapons.

07:32.930 --> 07:36.673
- They'’re taking aim!
- So disappointing.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.514
<i>Airlock seal repressurizing.</i>

07:51.514 --> 07:54.778
Huh.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.563
Nice.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.956
- We'’re clear.
- For now at least.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.613
We should maintain
the lockdown.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.679
<i>EVA airlock opening.</i>

08:29.596 --> 08:31.075
<i>Pressuring.</i>

08:31.075 --> 08:33.382
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

08:36.428 --> 08:38.300
<i>Atmosphere equalized.</i>

09:06.633 --> 09:08.635
He'’s the only one in there.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.288
Must have gotten stuck
in the hatchway

09:10.288 --> 09:12.073
when the others were sucked out.

09:12.073 --> 09:15.467
I'’m not sure if he froze
or asphyxiated first.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.687
Search the shuttle.

09:17.687 --> 09:20.560
See if we can get
any clue why the hell
they sent these guys

09:20.560 --> 09:22.039
instead of just shooting us
with that weapon of theirs.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.238
Everyone, stay where
I can see you.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.335
William Trust in the flesh.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.337
I didn'’t believe it
when Kelly signaled.

09:59.337 --> 10:02.558
Congratulations, kid.
Good job.

10:02.558 --> 10:03.907
- I hope she thinks so.
- She will.

10:03.907 --> 10:07.519
- Who is she? Your boss?
- Shut up.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.913
- Where'’s the DNA vault?
- I don'’t know.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.959
- But he does.
- Take us.

10:15.745 --> 10:17.355
Mr. Trust, you'’re coming, too.

10:17.355 --> 10:20.576
No. Helena needs me
to take care of her.

10:20.576 --> 10:23.187
I'’ll be happy to put
a bullet through her head,

10:23.187 --> 10:25.450
then there would be
nothing to care for.

10:25.450 --> 10:28.279
- No.
- It'’s all right, Will.

10:28.279 --> 10:33.763
- Go. I'’ll be fine.
- I love you.

10:37.288 --> 10:41.075
- You'’re coming, too, Angus.
- What? But why?
I'’m no use to you.

10:41.075 --> 10:44.426
You'’re the most important man
on this mission, remember?

10:44.426 --> 10:46.602
And we were just starting
to get to know each other.

10:46.602 --> 10:49.692
Okay.

10:49.692 --> 10:52.129
Okay, okay.

11:03.793 --> 11:07.144
I'’m here, Helena.
It'’s going to be okay.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.320
No, it'’s not.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.976
But if I can'’t have my husband

11:12.976 --> 11:14.935
holding my hand while I die,

11:14.935 --> 11:18.547
my next choice would be
my best friend.

11:23.247 --> 11:26.120
No.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.340
Okay, okay.

11:33.823 --> 11:36.826
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

11:39.176 --> 11:40.308
Help!

11:40.308 --> 11:43.398
Help!

11:43.398 --> 11:44.616
Help!

12:01.764 --> 12:04.245
- The halls are too empty.
- They locked themselves

12:04.245 --> 12:05.725
in their rooms
when they saw you coming.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.075
Which probably
wasn'’t such a bad idea

12:08.075 --> 12:09.990
since they don'’t have
any weapons, thanks to me.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.688
I convinced
their head of security
to space them all.

12:12.688 --> 12:15.038
- How'’d you manage that?
- Long story,

12:15.038 --> 12:17.214
but should be clear sailing back
to our shuttle.

12:19.434 --> 12:20.957
- Damn it.
- What?

12:20.957 --> 12:22.872
Just got a message from Ark 15.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.265
All our crew members are dead.

12:26.267 --> 12:28.356
- You think it'’s funny?
- Calm down.

12:28.356 --> 12:29.749
We might need him to get back
to Ark 15.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.402
We can'’t get back.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.491
They have our shuttle.
It'’s guarded.

12:36.146 --> 12:39.106
But you know what'’s probably
not guarded? Their shuttle.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.153
Lead the way.

13:03.086 --> 13:03.913
Don'’t move!

13:14.663 --> 13:16.621
Shoot him!

13:16.621 --> 13:18.058
- Shoot him now!
- I can'’t get a clean shot!

13:18.058 --> 13:20.060
Shoot!

13:35.466 --> 13:38.121
Bet you regret dumping

13:38.121 --> 13:39.383
those guns about now, huh?

13:39.383 --> 13:42.647
Missed one by the way.

13:42.647 --> 13:46.129
Was anything you told me true?

13:46.129 --> 13:49.480
- Did you even know Robert?
- Never met the man.

13:51.091 --> 13:54.181
But I knew Marko,
who you just killed.

13:54.181 --> 13:57.053
He was a friend.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.013
Oh, is he your friend, Angus?

14:18.205 --> 14:19.249
Wake up.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.344
It'’s me. It's me, Griff.

14:27.344 --> 14:30.608
- Griff?
- Let me go.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.705
Damn.

14:40.705 --> 14:44.187
Strickland to
Lieutenant Garnet.
Are you all right?

14:44.187 --> 14:47.538
<i>I'’m fine, why?</i>
- We have a problem.

15:02.597 --> 15:04.033
It'’s not too late
to change your mind.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.296
This is crazy
what you'’re doing.

15:06.296 --> 15:09.038
What'’s so crazy about it?
It seems to be
going well for me.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.954
Okay, who'’s going
to fly this thing?

15:11.954 --> 15:15.001
- Are you a pilot?
- No. But you are.

15:15.001 --> 15:19.179
- No. No, I'’m not.
- Sure you are.
Angus told me.

15:21.529 --> 15:25.359
- Now fly us to Ark 15.
- And what if I refuse?

15:25.359 --> 15:27.535
Well, I don'’t really need Angus.

15:27.535 --> 15:30.016
Okay, fine, fine.
I'’ll fly you.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.114
I never would have
really shot you.

15:41.114 --> 15:42.767
You know that, right?

16:04.006 --> 16:08.358
You'’ve been my best friend
for 15 years.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.099
You'’ve been mine.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.801
I want you to know
that I knew.

16:18.890 --> 16:22.068
- You knew?
- Mm.

16:22.068 --> 16:26.289
I could tell by the look
in your eyes

16:26.289 --> 16:28.074
that you were in love
with William.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.904
Well, I, uh...

16:32.904 --> 16:34.776
But you never acted on it.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.347
And that'’s a true friend.

16:43.654 --> 16:48.833
I need you to tell him
how much I love him.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.793
Helena, you'’re going
to tell him yourself.

16:51.793 --> 16:56.145
Promise me that--
that you'’ll watch out for him.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.588
Helena?

17:12.727 --> 17:14.163
Helena.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.168
Is everyone in here...

17:30.310 --> 17:34.401
- Did you find them?
- Not yet, but we have search
parties on every deck.

17:34.401 --> 17:37.186
- The shuttle just launched.
- Their shuttle is disabled.

17:37.186 --> 17:40.189
- Our shuttle.
- Oh, boy.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.278
That means they got whatever
they wanted on Ark 1.

17:42.278 --> 17:44.150
They wanted Lane, Angus,
and Trust.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.803
- Why?
- I don'’t know.

17:45.803 --> 17:46.848
But the second
that shuttle is clear,

17:46.848 --> 17:48.589
Ark 15'’s gonna fire on us.

17:48.589 --> 17:50.156
- Yup.
- Tell me it'’s been 82 minutes.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.505
Almost. A few seconds.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.468
Three, two, one.

18:09.566 --> 18:13.396
Whoo! Let'’s go.

18:13.396 --> 18:17.096
Nice job, guys.
We sustained
no additional damage.

18:42.469 --> 18:46.255
- Evelyn Maddox.
- Hello, William.
It'’s been too long.

18:46.255 --> 18:48.866
I'’d say it hasn't been
long enough.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.608
I was really hoping
for forever.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.132
Hi, Mother.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.265
I was surprised
you were still alive, Kelly.

18:56.265 --> 19:01.183
- Well, I am.
I did good, didn'’t I?
- It appears so.

19:01.183 --> 19:04.665
But why did you bring these
other two people with you?

19:04.665 --> 19:08.451
Oh, right. Um, Mother,

19:08.451 --> 19:10.671
I would like you to meet Angus.

19:10.671 --> 19:13.108
- Another boy.
- You'’ll like this one.

19:13.108 --> 19:15.676
- Hmm.
- He'’s a genius at making food.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.373
He'’ll be of great use
for our survival.

19:17.373 --> 19:21.290
And he'’s sweet.
You'’ll see once you get
to know him.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.467
- And, what about this one?
- Oh, I just needed him
to pilot.

19:24.467 --> 19:28.036
Oh, so he'’s no longer
of any use.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.733
Kill him and put him
in the NOR.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.909
Oh, you figured that out, too?

19:34.521 --> 19:37.088
- Never mind.
- Where is Marko
with the package?

19:37.088 --> 19:40.309
Um, Marko didn'’t make it.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.878
Neither did the package.
It'’s still on Ark 1.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.923
That package was the most
important part.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.273
Can'’t you do anything right?

19:47.273 --> 19:48.317
If I had gone back
for the package,

19:48.317 --> 19:49.579
we would have been caught.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.712
I thought Mr. Trust
was more important.

19:51.712 --> 19:53.496
- You thought?
- I'’m sorry.

19:53.496 --> 19:56.325
I thought you'’d be impressed
that I found Mr. Trust.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.634
You need me.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.767
I was second in command
on Ark 1.

20:03.767 --> 20:07.206
I know everything about it,
the commanding officer,
the way she thinks.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.164
Okay. Where did they go?

20:09.164 --> 20:13.951
- I don'’t know.
- Ugh. Take him.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.910
No, but I have a very good guess
of where they'’ll go eventually.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.477
- Where?
- Proxima B.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.783
I mean, that'’s where
she'’ll expect to find Ark 15.

20:19.783 --> 20:24.788
Why would she want to find us?
They know we have the weapon.

20:24.788 --> 20:27.922
Well, I mean,
if it was just me or Mr. Trust,
she probably wouldn'’t.

20:27.922 --> 20:30.272
In fact,
I'’d advise her against it.

20:30.272 --> 20:35.495
But knowing Sharon,
she'’ll want to come
and rescue Angus.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.279
Oh, yeah, she has
a soft spot for this kid.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.544
It looks like your latest
boy of the week

20:41.544 --> 20:43.372
might be valuable after all.

20:45.592 --> 20:50.205
And you might be of use, too.
Take us to Proxima B.

20:57.691 --> 21:01.695
If we go back, we'’re gonna
end up just like Ark 3,

21:01.695 --> 21:03.566
with another big hole
in the side of our ship,

21:03.566 --> 21:05.046
except this one will be fatal.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.352
Well, Mr. Trust'’s
vast knowledge

21:06.352 --> 21:08.179
might be valuable
to our survival.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.355
No, look, as far
as I'’m concerned,

21:09.355 --> 21:12.009
that man is not worth saving.

21:12.009 --> 21:14.795
He killed a lot
of people with Klampkins.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.841
Agreed. But what about Angus?

21:17.841 --> 21:22.368
Best hope, Kelly
sincerely cares about Angus

21:22.368 --> 21:24.370
so she'’ll keep him safe.

21:24.370 --> 21:26.850
I doubt it.
She was only using him.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.070
She doesn'’t really care
about Angus like I do.

21:33.509 --> 21:36.251
Like we do.

21:36.251 --> 21:38.035
Besides, what about
Lieutenant Lane?

21:40.255 --> 21:43.519
To be honest, I'’m not sure
how I feel about Lane
at this point.

21:43.519 --> 21:48.045
- He did lead a mutiny.
- It sounds like you'’re leaning
towards leaving them.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.657
No! We can'’t abandon Angus.

21:50.657 --> 21:53.137
- I insist we go
and rescue him.
- Oh, do you now?

21:53.137 --> 21:55.575
Even if we risk killing
every single person
on the ship trying?

21:57.838 --> 22:00.188
Perhaps before we make
this decision,

22:00.188 --> 22:02.625
we should question
Dr. Brandice.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.540
Maybe she overheard
something of value.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.476
Can'’t you move me
somewhere else?

22:27.476 --> 22:29.609
Cat, you knocked me out.
That'’s mutiny.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.611
Which is punishable by death.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.657
So if I were you,
I'’d cooperate.

22:34.657 --> 22:39.096
She was my best friend,
and I--

22:39.096 --> 22:40.576
I was a really bad friend.

22:40.576 --> 22:43.144
I mean really bad.

22:45.059 --> 22:50.107
But I really loved him.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.719
And you were probably
the closest thing
I had to a friend

22:52.719 --> 22:57.071
on this goddamn mess of a ship
and I screwed you over, too.

22:57.071 --> 23:00.857
And I haven'’t even accomplished
what I came here to do.

23:00.857 --> 23:03.382
I mean, the Juno Project
is all messed up.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.602
- Not that it matters anyway.
- Wait, Juno Project?

23:06.602 --> 23:08.387
And then you went and made me
the ship'’s shrink,

23:08.387 --> 23:10.519
which I'’m not qualified for,

23:10.519 --> 23:13.435
so I'’m undoubtedly
messing up people'’s heads
all over the ship.

23:13.435 --> 23:16.699
I mean, look at me,

23:16.699 --> 23:20.094
I'’m so messed up myself.

23:20.094 --> 23:21.791
How can I possibly--

23:21.791 --> 23:24.315
Cat.

23:24.315 --> 23:26.492
Cat.

23:26.492 --> 23:31.018
Hey, take a breath.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.367
We'’ll talk about all
that stuff later.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.500
But for now, I need you
to tell me anything

23:34.500 --> 23:36.937
that was said in this room
that might help.

23:36.937 --> 23:39.330
- Like what?
- Anything that will
give us a clue

23:39.330 --> 23:40.810
what Kelly'’s boss wanted.

23:40.810 --> 23:44.553
- They never said.
- Think.

23:44.553 --> 23:48.296
There has to be something.
A name, a time table.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.345
The guy with the gun
said something about DNA.

23:56.391 --> 24:00.395
Cat, you just earned
yourself house arrest
in your own quarters.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.745
Take her to her quarters.

24:02.745 --> 24:05.008
Alicia, meet me
in the DNA vault.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.758
They took whatever
they were looking for.

24:15.758 --> 24:17.586
And they tore the label
off the drawer.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.762
They didn'’t want us
to know what it was.

24:19.762 --> 24:22.243
Did you check the body
of the man who attacked you?

24:44.570 --> 24:46.006
Do you know
what these are for?

24:46.006 --> 24:49.009
Loxosceles rufescens.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.577
It'’s a Mediterranean
recluse spider.

24:51.577 --> 24:54.449
Biology is more Angus'’ thing.

24:54.449 --> 24:58.409
It says that it'’s
a really venomous spider.
Why would they want that?

24:58.409 --> 25:01.543
I don'’t know.
See if you can find out.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.892
And get it on ice
in the meantime.

25:10.378 --> 25:11.684
I love what you'’ve done
with the place.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.686
Isn'’t it wonderful?

25:13.686 --> 25:16.253
Someone had to take all
the beautiful creations of man

25:16.253 --> 25:19.822
instead of letting it all rot
in Le Louvre or Le Hermitage.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.608
- So you stole all of this?
- No one cared.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.697
They had no use
for beautiful objects.

25:24.697 --> 25:28.657
Everyone was too busy
trying to find food
and safe water.

25:28.657 --> 25:31.312
So everything Kelly
told us was true.
It really got that bad?

25:31.312 --> 25:34.881
I don'’t know what she told you,
but the world fell apart.

25:34.881 --> 25:38.449
My people and I were fortunate
to grab Ark 15 and get out.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.800
- Grab?
- She stole it.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.890
After Ark 5,
the last official ship,

25:43.890 --> 25:47.850
people were so busy
making their own armies
and taking ships by force.

25:47.850 --> 25:51.898
Half the arks blew up
because people didn'’t know
how to operate them.

25:51.898 --> 25:55.684
So you took that little
mercenary force you always had
and stole Ark 15?

25:55.684 --> 25:59.383
- I created the arks.
They were rightfully mine.
- I created the arks.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.129
Here it is, William.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.133
Proxima B.

26:12.092 --> 26:15.704
The culmination of everything
you worked for.

26:18.881 --> 26:21.667
It was just as much
Helena'’s work.

26:21.667 --> 26:25.366
Helena was unfortunate
collateral damage in our
progress to save humanity.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.934
From what I'’ve seen,
you'’ve left a lot of collateral
damage in your wake.

26:27.934 --> 26:31.502
Like half of the people on Ark 1
and everyone on Ark 3.

26:31.502 --> 26:34.941
And it looks to me like there'’s
plenty of room down there.

26:34.941 --> 26:38.205
I don'’t understand why we can't
just share the planet.

26:38.205 --> 26:42.601
Because Evelyn wants
total and complete control
over what'’s left of humanity.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.515
But the GSA stood
in her way.

26:44.515 --> 26:47.344
Look who'’s talking.
You wanted the same thing.

26:47.344 --> 26:50.130
- You wanted to rule.
- I wanted to lead.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.479
There'’s a huge difference.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.568
And people would want me to,

26:53.568 --> 26:55.309
since I would have just saved
all of their lives

26:55.309 --> 26:56.919
and mankind itself.

26:56.919 --> 26:59.313
Lead? You couldn'’t even
lead your own company,

26:59.313 --> 27:00.749
much less all of humanity.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.143
Wow, you guys really do
give "god complex"

27:03.143 --> 27:05.058
a whole new meaning,
don'’t you?

27:07.756 --> 27:10.585
So that'’s why you attacked
Arks 1 and 3?

27:10.585 --> 27:12.282
Just to get rid
of the GSA command?

27:12.282 --> 27:16.591
Don'’t be stupid.
That was just a bonus.

27:16.591 --> 27:19.159
I was looking for something
very important to me.

27:19.159 --> 27:22.031
Whatever the package was that
Kelly neglected to get you.

27:22.031 --> 27:24.947
The truth is, I was also hoping

27:24.947 --> 27:28.559
to kill William and Helena.

27:28.559 --> 27:32.520
- Why?
- I have my reasons.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.609
I'’m sure you do.

27:34.609 --> 27:36.611
But now that you have me,
why aren'’t you killing me?

27:36.611 --> 27:40.267
Because as much
as I hate to admit it,
you were right.

27:40.267 --> 27:44.184
Proxima B
is an eyeball planet.

27:44.184 --> 27:45.402
Well, I told you that
ten years ago.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.187
What does that mean,
an eyeball planet?

27:47.187 --> 27:49.972
It'’s a planet that doesn't spin
on its own axis.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.018
The sun only hits
one segment of the planet.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.803
It'’s too hot there,
and too cold on the rest
to sustain human life.

27:54.803 --> 27:58.024
But William has
a solution, don'’t you?

27:58.024 --> 28:01.941
He was working on a technology
to restart planetary rotation.

28:01.941 --> 28:05.205
Get it to the right speed
to even out the heat

28:05.205 --> 28:07.120
on the whole planet.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.599
Yes, I was working on that.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.210
And then you
took over Trust Corp

28:10.210 --> 28:11.733
and decided it was
a waste of money.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.692
I never completed
the programming.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.912
- But you did complete
the devices.
- I did.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.653
But they'’re worthless
without the programming.

28:18.653 --> 28:21.003
Oh, come on, William.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.918
How long have we known
each other?

28:22.918 --> 28:24.441
We both know you finished it.

28:24.441 --> 28:26.835
- You just never gave it to me.
- Not true.

28:26.835 --> 28:29.055
I'’m literally
betting my life on it.

28:29.055 --> 28:31.274
What did you do?

28:31.274 --> 28:35.017
We already deployed
the devices on the planet.

28:35.017 --> 28:37.498
I only need you
to beam down the programming

28:37.498 --> 28:40.066
and the parameters necessary
to activate them.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.459
And even if I had
the programming,

28:42.459 --> 28:43.809
why would I give then to you?

28:43.809 --> 28:46.028
Because I'’ll guarantee
your safety

28:46.028 --> 28:50.032
to live out your life
on Proxima B in luxury.

28:50.032 --> 28:53.035
Your dream.

28:53.035 --> 28:55.298
It'’s meaningless to me
without Helena.

28:55.298 --> 29:00.826
Come on. You'’ll be
in bed with another woman
as soon as you have a bed.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.175
Go screw yourself, Evelyn.

29:04.612 --> 29:06.353
Let him rot in the brig
for a while.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.616
He'’ll change his mind.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.115
There was a day I would have
given my left arm

29:29.115 --> 29:31.334
to have been in the same room
as you and Evelyn Maddox.

29:34.685 --> 29:37.471
What is it they say?

29:37.471 --> 29:39.690
Never meet your heroes?

29:39.690 --> 29:41.127
Well, I'’m sorry to disappoint.

29:41.127 --> 29:44.217
Do the devices
she deployed even work?

29:44.217 --> 29:47.568
Of course they work.
I designed them.

29:47.568 --> 29:51.180
If Evelyn deploys
my super electromagnets
properly on the equator,

29:51.180 --> 29:54.444
I simply have to program them
with the proper parameters

29:54.444 --> 29:57.447
to push against
the planet'’s magnetic poles
and slowly spin it up.

29:57.447 --> 30:00.450
Then why didn'’t you take
the deal she offered?

30:00.450 --> 30:03.540
Because I know Evelyn.

30:03.540 --> 30:07.762
If I give her what she wants,
she'’ll kill me and you.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.895
What happens if you
never give it to her?

30:09.895 --> 30:12.723
Eventually she'’ll
still kill us,

30:12.723 --> 30:14.813
but at least
this buys us time.

30:25.127 --> 30:27.521
We'’ve uncovered something
very promising.

30:27.521 --> 30:29.610
Lieutenant Brice,
Lieutenant Brice!

30:29.610 --> 30:32.743
- It'’s amazing news!
- Is it? Did you get
your grown-up teeth?

30:32.743 --> 30:35.616
We figured out why
they need the recluse
spider'’s DNA so much.

30:35.616 --> 30:38.575
We cross-referenced the Ark 3
historic archives with
this particular species of--

30:38.575 --> 30:41.143
The spider'’s venom
is the cure for Klampkins.

30:41.143 --> 30:45.191
Slow down.
It'’s a component of the cure.

30:45.191 --> 30:48.585
And let me guess.
You don'’t have
the other components?

30:48.585 --> 30:53.982
- Well, I don'’t even know
what they all are.
- Of course you don'’t.

30:53.982 --> 30:57.333
Well,
the article only said that
the scientists combined it

30:57.333 --> 31:00.423
with the other two ingredients
they'’ve been experimenting with,

31:00.423 --> 31:04.166
- and it worked.
- So it actually cured
Klampkins in people?

31:04.166 --> 31:05.907
100% of the people
they gave it to.

31:05.907 --> 31:07.822
I'’m sensing there's
a "but" coming.

31:07.822 --> 31:10.172
When they tried
to mass produce it,

31:10.172 --> 31:12.609
the spiders
were already endangered.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.394
Pharma companies
didn'’t slow production

31:14.394 --> 31:16.048
so they could
breed more spiders.

31:16.048 --> 31:19.616
Instead they burned right
through the remaining population

31:19.616 --> 31:21.227
and the spider went extinct.

31:21.227 --> 31:24.230
Didn'’t they have it in
the Smithsonian DNA repository?

31:24.230 --> 31:26.972
That got burned down
by anti-science protesters.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.670
- So did the one in London.
- But here'’s the good news.

31:29.670 --> 31:32.194
There are still several
samples of the DNA

31:32.194 --> 31:34.414
from that particular spider

31:34.414 --> 31:36.068
and it'’s spread across
a whole bunch of the arks.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.721
And one of them is Ark 1?

31:37.721 --> 31:39.723
But I'’m guessing,
not Ark 3 and not Ark 15.

31:39.723 --> 31:42.378
So that'’s why Ark 15
wanted ours so badly.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.119
You know what
that means, right?

31:44.119 --> 31:46.121
Yeah, it means that someone
over there has Klampkins.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.906
And I'’m betting
it'’s someone important.

32:00.831 --> 32:01.702
Hungry?

32:04.661 --> 32:05.532
I guess.

32:08.491 --> 32:11.799
- Mind if I sit with you?
I'’m starving.
- Whatever.

32:11.799 --> 32:14.584
- It'’s your room.
- No, it'’s yours.

32:14.584 --> 32:19.241
We have a bunch
of rooms like this.
Mine'’s next door.

32:19.241 --> 32:22.766
And I hope that you and I
will move into a room
together one day.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.511
I know we don'’t know
each other that well yet,

32:28.511 --> 32:32.298
but I think once
you get to know me better,
you'’ll see.

32:32.298 --> 32:34.822
We would be perfect together.

32:34.822 --> 32:37.956
Are Lieutenant Lane
and Mr. Trust in rooms
like this, too?

32:37.956 --> 32:41.481
No, they'’re in the brig.

32:41.481 --> 32:42.917
They'’re not my friend
like you are.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.484
If I'’m your friend,
you have a funny way

32:44.484 --> 32:47.269
of showing it--
keeping me locked up.

32:47.269 --> 32:51.143
Well, I'’m sorry, Angus,
but you have to prove
that I can trust you first.

32:51.143 --> 32:54.276
Why?

32:54.276 --> 32:56.148
Obviously I can'’t trust you.

32:56.148 --> 32:59.978
- How can you say that?
I saved your life.
- From what?

32:59.978 --> 33:02.197
Far as I can tell,
you saved me from you.

33:02.197 --> 33:06.506
You and your mom
tried to kill me
and all my friends.

33:06.506 --> 33:10.292
- I'’m sorry you see it that way.
- On the other hand,

33:10.292 --> 33:12.947
Lieutenant Lane
really saved your life.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.557
You'’d be dead on Ark 3 and--

33:17.517 --> 33:20.476
Wait a minute,
why were you on Ark 3?

33:20.476 --> 33:23.740
I was part of a boarding party.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.091
For someone so smart,
you sure are stupid sometimes.

33:26.091 --> 33:31.531
So-- so after your mom
killed everyone on Ark 3

33:31.531 --> 33:34.316
with her big gun on Ark 15,

33:34.316 --> 33:36.144
she sent a boarding party?

33:36.144 --> 33:38.842
Of course.
We had to find the DNA.

33:38.842 --> 33:41.976
We didn'’t know there was
a DNA vault on Ark 1 until
Lieutenant Lane showed me.

33:41.976 --> 33:45.371
Well, I guess you didn'’t
find it on Ark 3 either.

33:45.371 --> 33:49.331
Never got to look for it.
There were five of us,
but a bunch of the Ark 3 idiots

33:49.331 --> 33:52.160
were suited up in EVA suits
making repairs.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.816
They killed three of us.
Four if you count Ross.

33:55.816 --> 33:58.166
- And then I killed
all of them when--
- You killed all those people?

33:58.166 --> 34:00.908
Well, what else would I do?
It was me or them.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.350
So why were you still there?

34:13.355 --> 34:14.487
Did your mother leave you?

34:14.487 --> 34:16.750
She didn'’t know
I was still alive.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.145
Don'’t you have comms
on your wrist device?

34:20.145 --> 34:22.190
Mine was broken, remember?

34:22.190 --> 34:26.064
She would have done anything
to save me if she knew
I was still alive.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.415
Really? Because I saw when
I came aboard this ship,

34:29.415 --> 34:32.026
- she didn'’t even hug you
when she saw you.
- Shut up.

34:32.026 --> 34:34.942
All I heard was her
calling you an idiot.

34:34.942 --> 34:36.335
I don'’t get
your loyalty to her.

34:36.335 --> 34:37.858
She'’s my mother.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.080
I don'’t want to eat
with you anymore.

34:55.136 --> 34:58.400
Is it true?
You turned us around and now
we'’re going to Proxima B

34:58.400 --> 35:01.186
- instead of Ross 128?
- Yes.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.753
- You know Ark 15 will be there.
- Yup.

35:03.753 --> 35:05.929
Then it'’s suicidal to go.
They already fired on us once.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.714
We'’ve already had
this argument, Felix.

35:07.714 --> 35:10.847
- You'’re spinning your wheels.
- We'’re almost there.

35:10.847 --> 35:13.023
I'’m getting a signature
on Ark 15'’s electronics.

35:13.023 --> 35:14.851
I can pinpoint
where they are in orbit.

35:14.851 --> 35:17.680
Good. Drop us out of FTL
within shuttle range of them.

35:17.680 --> 35:21.467
- Are you sure?
- Guys, they'’re not gonna
fire on us.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.425
We have a bargaining chip
they won'’t put at risk.

35:40.921 --> 35:44.054
Ark 15, this is
Lieutenant Garnet of Ark 1.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.882
We have your spider DNA.

35:45.882 --> 35:48.450
If you fire on us,
we will destroy it.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.800
<i>This is Evelyn Maddox.</i>

35:55.153 --> 35:58.156
I can'’t say it's a pleasure
to meet you, Miss Maddox,
after what you'’ve done.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.766
So I'’ll cut right to the chase.

35:59.766 --> 36:02.116
We have the Spider DNA
you want so badly.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.031
Give us back our people
and we'’ll give it to you.

36:04.031 --> 36:07.687
If you do anything else,
shoot at us,

36:07.687 --> 36:10.516
try to board us,
we'’ll destroy it.

36:10.516 --> 36:13.954
<i>I don'’t know what spider DNA
you'’re talking about.</i>

36:13.954 --> 36:16.913
I'’m not playing games,
Miss Maddox.

36:16.913 --> 36:21.701
<i>Nor am I. I have no interest
in any kind of DNA.</i>

36:21.701 --> 36:26.923
Is it you
or someone close to you
who has Klampkins?

36:26.923 --> 36:29.317
<i>I don'’t know
what you'’re talking about.</i>

36:29.317 --> 36:31.145
From what I understand,
Klampkins victims

36:31.145 --> 36:32.668
don'’t know when
it'’s going to kill them.

36:32.668 --> 36:34.888
You could even die
in the next few minutes.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.978
So if I were you,
I'’d get serious
about this offer fast,

36:37.978 --> 36:41.721
before I throw this DNA
out of the airlock.

36:41.721 --> 36:43.418
Call me back when you'’re ready
to make a deal.

37:03.090 --> 37:06.311
That was a ballsy move, Sharon.

37:06.311 --> 37:08.661
I really hope it was
the right one.

37:08.661 --> 37:12.404
Well, they didn'’t fire on us.
So there is hope.

37:12.404 --> 37:15.015
<i>Lieutenant?</i>

37:15.015 --> 37:19.193
- I'’m here.
- <i>I have a counter offer.</i>

37:19.193 --> 37:22.370
<i>We will give you the boy wonder
and your Lieutenant Lane,</i>

37:22.370 --> 37:25.373
<i>but we will not give you
William Trust.</i>

37:25.373 --> 37:27.680
You can keep Trust.
We don'’t want him.

37:27.680 --> 37:31.161
<i>Good. Send someone
in your shuttle with the DNA</i>

37:31.161 --> 37:32.380
<i>and we'’ll make a trade.</i>

37:32.380 --> 37:34.121
We'’ll send someone immediately.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.993
- Have the prisoners ready.
- Are you crazy?

37:36.993 --> 37:40.127
Sharon, you can'’t
trust Evelyn Maddox.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.824
You'’re right. We can't.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.437
Oh, you devil.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.047
You'’re playing 3-D chess here,
aren'’t you?

37:47.047 --> 37:47.917
Mm-hmm.

37:50.790 --> 37:51.791
All right, what'’s the plan?

37:51.791 --> 37:53.793
- I'’ll go.
- No, you won'’t.

37:53.793 --> 37:56.404
What if you pass out
in the middle of
whatever this plan is?

37:56.404 --> 37:59.102
Well, you know what?
Beats the hell out
of waking up in a closet

37:59.102 --> 38:02.149
because your friend drugs you
after having sex with you first.

38:02.149 --> 38:05.587
I tried to get you
to drink the water before
we did it, but you wouldn'’t.

38:05.587 --> 38:06.762
Aww, come on now--

38:13.508 --> 38:15.597
Passing out
will not be a problem

38:15.597 --> 38:17.338
because I'’m taking
Cogner with me to copilot.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.558
- You are?
- Yeah.

38:21.821 --> 38:24.389
Um, Eva'’s right.

38:24.389 --> 38:26.565
This mission
might take a while.

38:26.565 --> 38:29.829
If you pass out,
that would be a problem, okay?

38:29.829 --> 38:32.397
- I'’ll go with Cogner.
- What? No, I should go.

38:32.397 --> 38:36.139
I appreciate your offer,
Felix, but this one'’s mine.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.274
Brice, you'’re in charge
until I return.

38:54.723 --> 38:57.204
I mean, Brice and Eva.

38:57.204 --> 38:58.640
From what I'’ve been told,

38:58.640 --> 39:00.860
Brice and any woman
is not surprising.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.557
I can attest to that.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.433
I mean, it was my idea.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.304
Just burning off some stress.

39:13.307 --> 39:18.007
- He'’s hot. You must
have thought about--
- Never. Not once.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.732
- Did you bring the DNA?
- I did.

39:46.732 --> 39:51.911
But you should know,
my partner is staying behind
in the shuttle with a bomb,

39:51.911 --> 39:55.088
and she'’ll detonate it
if you pull a fast one.

39:55.088 --> 39:56.306
The DNA.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.797
Uh, wait.
Where are our people?

40:08.797 --> 40:13.367
We have to test the DNA
to make sure it'’s
legitimate first.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.848
- Surely you understand.
- But that was not our deal.

40:15.848 --> 40:19.155
Go back to your ark,
and we'’ll send
our prisoners over

40:19.155 --> 40:21.680
when we'’re sure you gave us
the real product.

40:21.680 --> 40:26.728
Give me our people now
or my partner will
blow up your ship.

40:26.728 --> 40:30.036
And kill us all?
You and my hostages included?

40:30.036 --> 40:33.169
- I don'’t think so.
- But we had a deal.

40:33.169 --> 40:34.823
I mean, you were supposed--

40:34.823 --> 40:38.305
You'’re lucky I'm letting you
go back to your ship alive.

40:38.305 --> 40:40.438
I'’m starting to change my mind.

40:55.017 --> 40:59.587
As soon as Dr. Rogers confirms
it'’s the right DNA, open fire.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.981
Make sure you leave
no survivors this time.

41:13.775 --> 41:16.996
- Do they suspect anything?
- No.

41:16.996 --> 41:17.866
Did you make it in?

41:38.452 --> 41:40.976
I'’m in.
<i>Good luck.</i>

41:40.976 --> 41:43.588
I was in Engineering.

41:43.588 --> 41:45.807
Want to explain
what just happened?

41:45.807 --> 41:48.244
We used the same ruse
they used on us.

41:48.244 --> 41:51.813
Garnet space walked to their
other airlock and snuck in

41:51.813 --> 41:53.511
while they were focused
on the shuttle dock.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.077
So she'’s on Ark 15?
