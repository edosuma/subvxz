00:05.214 --> 00:07.376
Oh, please, I was just reading
some cooking blogs

00:07.674 --> 00:09.711
and got a little Epicurious
and decided to just

00:10.010 --> 00:11.592

whatever looked fun.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.798
Candied walnuts?
These are fantastic.

Couldn't have been easier.

You crack them, hull them,

00:18.602 --> 00:19.592

00:19.895 --> 00:21.636
rub with cayenne pepper,
some turmeric,

00:21.939 --> 00:23.600
cinnamon sugar
and put them in the oven

00:23.899 --> 00:25.640

00:49.800 --> 00:51.416
One single date
with some stranger

00:51.718 --> 00:53.459

than what we fake have?

00:53.762 --> 00:56.049
Yeah, and honestly,
I'm sick of being your beard.

00:56.348 --> 00:58.385
For someone who behaves
nothing like a gay guy,

00:58.684 --> 01:01.051

how to act like a straight guy.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.310

01:03.605 --> 01:06.267
Can't get enough of these,
am I right?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.938

Then you followed it with

01:10.237 --> 01:12.069
"Don't even get me started with
what's going on down there."

You come out.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.903
Ugh, coming out is so gay.

Why me?

01:25.335 --> 01:26.746
Why not me?
You're my only hope.

Jane, there is no one else.

Wait, can nobody hear me?
Am I a ghost?

01:31.508 --> 01:32.873
Yes.
It's nothing personal.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.588
| just personally feel
that Jane would be better at it.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.469
How is that not personal?
It's true.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.550
I'd be an awesome beard.
Parents love me.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.012
So you'll do it?
No, Max, it's time to come out.

Jane's right.
Look, I hear you guys.

No.

and you insulted me to my face.
