00:00.997 --> 00:03.148
<i>Okay, so last time
you all saw</i> Star...

00:03.150 --> 00:06.596
- Dee, chill.
- Somebody come quick, please!

00:06.598 --> 00:08.281
<i>I thought I was never
gonna see you again.</i>

00:08.350 --> 00:11.117
Double-cross the devil's wife
and you squash our beef.

00:11.186 --> 00:12.318
You juggling too much.

00:12.387 --> 00:13.760
- Let me handle the salon.
- You up to it?

00:13.762 --> 00:16.027
- I heard you on the phone with Elliot.
- He offered me a job.

00:16.030 --> 00:17.607
<i>So he done got you locked and
then gonna offer you a job?</i>

00:17.631 --> 00:19.298
So, do I get my
own parking spot?

00:19.367 --> 00:21.345
It's not just one thing this
lady doesn't like about us.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.748
She has a whole list.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.149
<i>Your group released property</i>

00:24.218 --> 00:25.384
<i>without my written consent.</i>

00:25.419 --> 00:26.852
As a result, you're parked.

00:26.921 --> 00:29.148
Whatever we got to deal with
with Ayanna and Midtown,

00:29.150 --> 00:30.204
we gonna do it together.

00:30.206 --> 00:31.368
<i>Carlotta Brown's
here to see you.</i>

00:31.392 --> 00:32.725
I did my homework on you.

00:32.793 --> 00:33.873
Do I need to call security?

00:33.928 --> 00:35.995
I am security. And if
you take your head

00:36.063 --> 00:39.262
out your ass, you'll see that
I'm security for you, too.

Mm...

00:52.776 --> 00:54.324
- I'm not hurting you, am I?
- No, babe.

00:54.348 --> 00:55.881
- Are you sure.
- It's... it's perfect.

00:55.950 --> 00:58.639
Just... let's finish
before Grandma get up.

00:59.512 --> 01:00.753
Okay.

01:05.292 --> 01:07.660
Okay. Your lines are clear.

01:07.728 --> 01:10.062
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:23.978 --> 01:26.445
Nice. That new?

01:31.253 --> 01:34.486
No, my mom got this
for me a while ago.

01:37.420 --> 01:39.714
_

01:56.674 --> 01:59.089
They said the doors supposed to
be open since Dee killed herself.

01:59.113 --> 02:01.380
Hey, look, I'm sorry
about what happened,

02:01.449 --> 02:03.482
and I know that she
was your friend.

02:04.618 --> 02:07.319
Are you... you trying to
bond with me or something?

02:07.388 --> 02:09.217
Just 'cause Dee's dead?

02:10.291 --> 02:12.524
I don't need your
sympathy, all right?

02:12.560 --> 02:13.726

Oh, good, the nail station.

03:37.529 --> 03:38.928
Put that over here for me, babe.

03:38.997 --> 03:40.274
We gonna have to knock
one of these walls down

03:40.298 --> 03:41.731
'cause this ain't gonna work.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.866
You ain't knocking down
no walls in this house.

03:43.935 --> 03:45.504
This ain't no HGTV makeover.

03:45.506 --> 03:48.673
Dyes and cuts, yes.
Little paint, maybe.

03:48.742 --> 03:50.683
Knocking down walls?
I don't think so.

03:50.685 --> 03:52.455
Would you let me reclaim
my time so we can get

03:52.479 --> 03:53.623
some coins flowing through here?

03:53.647 --> 03:54.980
You about to reclaim your spot

03:55.048 --> 03:56.893
on the unemployment line
is what you about to do.

03:56.917 --> 03:59.084
Oh, my gosh.

03:59.153 --> 04:00.806
Look at you.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.799
You gotta put you on some
work boots and a flannel,

04:02.823 --> 04:03.933
girl, and butch it
up around there.

04:03.957 --> 04:05.301
Bruce, why you always
throwing shame?

04:05.325 --> 04:06.458
I ain't throwing shame.

04:06.527 --> 04:07.704
I'd throw a palm tree at her ass

04:07.728 --> 04:09.294
if it'd knock some
sense into her.

04:09.363 --> 04:11.141
You know, girls getting
killed for that these days.

04:11.165 --> 04:12.230
She can pass.

04:12.299 --> 04:13.732
And she can handle herself.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.178
Ain't nothing wrong with
working a straight job

04:15.202 --> 04:16.468
in a crooked world.

04:16.536 --> 04:18.637
You would know about crooked.

04:18.704 --> 04:20.183
You and my crooked
daddy wrote the book.

04:20.207 --> 04:21.817
I'm surprised the girls
even took you back

04:21.841 --> 04:24.018
with your lying ass.

04:24.020 --> 04:25.877
Hey.

04:25.946 --> 04:27.812
Stop disrespecting your mother.

04:29.721 --> 04:31.194
You're lucky she
didn't knock you out.

04:31.218 --> 04:33.151
Hey, get out of my way, Jahil.

04:33.220 --> 04:35.620
Hey, hold up a second.
Can I talk to you?

04:35.689 --> 04:37.255
- I'm late for work.
- Yeah, listen.

04:37.291 --> 04:39.391
I heard about that
new gig with Elliot.

04:39.459 --> 04:40.803
Are you sure that's the
way you want to go?

04:40.827 --> 04:43.261
It's legit. I'm legit for once.

04:43.330 --> 04:45.030
Do you have a
better option, <i>Dad?</i>

04:45.098 --> 04:47.299
Look, I know you're
hurt, okay, Cotton?

04:47.334 --> 04:48.466
- Listen.
- Listen to what?

04:48.535 --> 04:49.601
How you couldn't trust me?

04:49.670 --> 04:51.236
I had to disappear, all right?

04:51.305 --> 04:53.405
Look, we were trying
to protect you.

04:53.473 --> 04:55.807
I had to disappear until this
whole thing just blew over.

04:55.876 --> 04:57.120
But now you're gonna blow back,
and we're supposed to be

04:57.144 --> 04:58.577
one big, happy family?

04:58.645 --> 05:00.023
Look, I'm just trying
to put the pieces

05:00.047 --> 05:01.157
back together,
Cotton, that's it.

05:01.181 --> 05:04.449
Okay? I know I messed up.
I know that.

05:06.386 --> 05:08.954
- But you're the most important piece.
- Listen.

05:09.022 --> 05:10.755
I don't need you to
put me back together,

05:10.791 --> 05:12.958
and I know your shady ass,
so whatever gray cloud

05:13.026 --> 05:15.026
you're under, it's
still following you.

05:16.930 --> 05:19.130
Hey, hey... Hey, come on.

05:19.199 --> 05:20.332
Thanks for the car.

05:28.408 --> 05:29.808
<i>Good morning, everybody.</i>

05:29.876 --> 05:31.977
Good morning, everybody.

05:32.012 --> 05:33.144
Good morning.

05:33.180 --> 05:34.846
Hey, sorry, I...

05:34.915 --> 05:36.381
was helping Derek.

05:36.450 --> 05:38.683
All right, you are
all in competition

05:38.752 --> 05:42.220
to be the artist who puts
Midtown Sound on the map.

05:42.289 --> 05:44.022
<i>Good Day Atlanta</i>
will be here doing

05:44.091 --> 05:46.558
an in-house segment covering
me and my new label,

05:46.627 --> 05:49.108
and two artists will
be a part of that.

05:49.110 --> 05:50.962
You will all be singing today,

05:51.031 --> 05:52.829
performing at various venues.

05:52.831 --> 05:55.000
Those performances
will determine

05:55.068 --> 05:56.434
who is highlighted on <i> GDA.</i>

05:56.503 --> 05:59.070
What is this,
<i>Ayanna's Got Talent?</i>

05:59.106 --> 06:00.538
More like <i>Ayanna's Got Ego.</i>

06:00.607 --> 06:02.040
No, just chill. We got this.

06:02.109 --> 06:05.110
Noah, you will be a
part of that segment.

06:05.178 --> 06:08.546
We will use <i> Good Day Atlanta</i>
to announce your new contract.

06:08.582 --> 06:11.750
Mass Effect, surprise. You're
performing at The Loft.

06:11.818 --> 06:13.485
- All right, all right.
- Seena Melody...

06:13.553 --> 06:17.255
Looks like she already wants
your boy front and center.

06:17.324 --> 06:18.356
Where do you want me?

06:18.425 --> 06:20.191
From what I hear,

06:20.260 --> 06:22.394
you wouldn't know what to
do once you got there.

06:22.462 --> 06:25.497
Big Trouble, you're performing
at Atlanta Underground.

06:25.565 --> 06:28.466
Uh, we're performing at a mall?

06:28.535 --> 06:30.046
The hell would you have
us perform at a mall for?

06:30.070 --> 06:31.654
It's a waste of
everybody's time.

06:31.656 --> 06:34.539
I mean, we won Atlanta
NextFest, didn't we?

06:34.608 --> 06:36.419
Until you have a sound, you
don't know what you are.

06:36.443 --> 06:37.842
I have an idea.

06:37.911 --> 06:39.944
Don't put us with
cheap-ass producers

06:40.013 --> 06:41.246
and maybe we'd find our sound.

06:41.315 --> 06:42.580
I've put you with a producer

06:42.649 --> 06:43.915
who can help you find a sound.

06:43.984 --> 06:45.216
He remixed "Suga."

06:45.285 --> 06:46.217
You'll be singing it today.

06:46.286 --> 06:47.552
Carlotta...

06:47.621 --> 06:49.264
is there a problem here?

06:49.634 --> 06:51.056
No.

06:51.124 --> 06:52.657
We'll do the gig.

06:53.986 --> 06:56.494
So, we know what we
doing, everybody?

06:56.530 --> 06:57.796
Let's get money.

07:01.268 --> 07:02.701
Relax, y'all.

07:02.769 --> 07:04.147
I know how to play
this trick here.

07:04.171 --> 07:05.503
A remix in a mall is bull.

07:05.572 --> 07:07.212
A mall is what we got
to prove who we are.

07:07.274 --> 07:09.174
Understand something,
this woman is gonna

07:09.209 --> 07:10.420
make you work three times harder

07:10.444 --> 07:11.621
than any artist on this label.

07:11.645 --> 07:12.645
But why?

07:12.713 --> 07:13.987
I don't understand that.

07:13.989 --> 07:16.548
First of all, she inherited you.
She didn't get to choose you.

07:16.616 --> 07:18.683
But on top of that, you're
three strong women,

07:18.752 --> 07:19.784
and that threatens her...

07:19.853 --> 07:21.586
Puts you on her level.

07:21.655 --> 07:23.023
So just slay the gig,

07:23.025 --> 07:26.491
and we'll be able to go for whatever
the hell we want after that.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.093
I'll deal with Ayanna.

07:28.161 --> 07:32.564
♪ So I give him my suga,
suga, suga, suga ♪

07:32.632 --> 07:34.399
♪ He don't deserve it
but I give him my ♪

07:34.468 --> 07:37.635
♪ Suga, suga, suga, suga... ♪

07:37.704 --> 07:40.739
She took one of our best songs and
ruined it. I'm not singing this.

07:40.774 --> 07:42.741
Oh, so we're just gonna
tell Miss Carlotta

07:42.809 --> 07:44.943
we're gonna bag the track
and blow our opportunity?

07:45.011 --> 07:47.612
This entire process has been
us jumping through hoops.

07:47.681 --> 07:50.382
We should just bounce from
Midtown, honestly... I'm done.

07:50.450 --> 07:52.550
Let the contract expire.

07:53.926 --> 07:55.019
Slow down, Rihanna.

07:55.088 --> 07:57.755
Maybe that's an option for you,
but me and Simone need this.

07:57.757 --> 07:59.991
Yeah, the track is wack
and the venue sucks,

08:00.060 --> 08:01.938
but if we leave Midtown with
nothing to show for it,

08:01.962 --> 08:03.162
we're gonna be bouncing around

08:03.196 --> 08:04.629
to different labels
looking burnt.

08:04.698 --> 08:06.931
So take a risk. Go indie.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.633
Says the girl with the
platinum parachute

08:08.702 --> 08:11.202
- in her Chanel backpack.
- Have you not seen my life lately?

08:11.271 --> 08:13.866
- I might as well be you.
- What is that supposed to mean?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.051
- You know exactly what it means.
- 'Cause you know what? Yeah.

08:15.075 --> 08:16.552
- You still look pretty blingy to me.
- Don't get this twisted.

08:16.576 --> 08:18.076
I don't have any jewelry on.
Do you, Simone?

08:18.078 --> 08:20.289
- Do not get this twisted. You don't see
- I'm calling it like I see it.

08:20.313 --> 08:21.647
A damn thing unless you're
in the center of it.

08:21.649 --> 08:23.214
Guys, can we all take a breath?

08:26.620 --> 08:28.620
Some things never change.

08:28.688 --> 08:33.091
And people wonder why girl
groups never work out.

08:40.549 --> 08:43.916
Talk about fake news.

08:44.817 --> 08:46.619
I knew you weren't
dead, in my bones.

08:47.112 --> 08:49.088
And Carlotta confirmed it.

08:49.123 --> 08:51.524
What do you want?

08:51.559 --> 08:53.092
Nothing.

08:53.161 --> 08:55.261
Just checking in on you,
you know, now that you're

08:55.330 --> 08:57.863
at the label that we all worked
so hard to get you signed to.

08:57.932 --> 08:59.076
You know you weren't
in the picture

08:59.100 --> 09:00.399
when we got signed here, Jahil.

09:00.468 --> 09:01.767
You weren't even in the frame.

09:01.836 --> 09:03.369
And you wouldn't
even gotten signed

09:03.438 --> 09:04.982
unless I had put you on in
the first place, right?

09:05.006 --> 09:06.939
So you want to
focus on what was,

09:07.008 --> 09:08.841
or do you want to
deal with what is?

09:08.910 --> 09:10.654
Because let's start with Alex.
She's right on point right now.

09:10.678 --> 09:13.913
That "Suga" remix, it's not you.

09:13.982 --> 09:15.548
You need a better producer.

09:15.583 --> 09:17.783
- Oh, here he goes.
- So let me produce it.

09:17.852 --> 09:19.865
Come on. Like I did for Mixed Harmony.
Let me do it.

09:19.867 --> 09:22.388
Damn. You haven't even
been here for a second,

09:22.457 --> 09:23.723
and you're already trying to...

09:23.758 --> 09:25.291
You were a half-assed
manager, Jahil.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.904
What? You want to try
your hand now at being

09:26.928 --> 09:28.339
- a half-assed producer?
- Look, I've been working

09:28.363 --> 09:29.807
on a lot of music
while I've been away.

09:29.831 --> 09:31.197
And I got decades of experience

09:31.265 --> 09:32.843
under my belt in this
game and you know it.

09:32.867 --> 09:34.467
So you're serious?

09:34.535 --> 09:36.013
- Yes, I am.
- You think this is about to be

09:36.037 --> 09:37.370
some kind of shakedown?

09:37.438 --> 09:39.138
That's not how this
is gonna go, Jahil.

09:39.207 --> 09:41.107
We've been at this label
working our asses off

09:41.142 --> 09:42.742
to turn this hustle
into something real.

09:42.810 --> 09:44.977
You were actual dead weight.

09:45.046 --> 09:47.380
You're not pulling
us down this time.

09:47.448 --> 09:51.183
Go sell drugs or girls or
whatever it is you do.

09:56.005 --> 09:59.886
Ms. Brown. You're not allowed on the
executive floor without security anymore.

10:00.159 --> 10:01.694
- Excuse me?
- Um, unfortunately,

10:01.729 --> 10:03.596
Ayanna has asked that
all your communications

10:03.665 --> 10:05.931
go through your new A&R
exec, Maurice Jetter.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.433
Is this about the other night?

10:07.502 --> 10:09.035
Obviously.

10:09.103 --> 10:10.614
- Well, you let me in.
- Well, you came in and put your feet

10:10.638 --> 10:12.238
on the lady's desk and
fixed your drink.

10:12.306 --> 10:13.951
- Didn't nobody ask you to do all that.
- You said,

10:13.975 --> 10:15.875
make myself comfortable.
You know what?

10:15.943 --> 10:17.621
I'm tired of being
disrespected at this label.

10:17.645 --> 10:18.911
What's the matter?

10:21.649 --> 10:23.582
This kid here is telling me

10:23.651 --> 10:26.752
that I need my new A&R guy to
hold my hand at this label.

10:26.788 --> 10:28.320
I'll handle this.

10:28.389 --> 10:30.589
- Come with me.
- No. I don't need to be handled.

10:30.658 --> 10:32.925
I just need to see
whoever this A&R guy is.

10:32.994 --> 10:35.461
I'll take care of
you, just this way.

10:38.439 --> 10:40.177
This is ridiculous.

10:42.403 --> 10:44.203
And of course, he's
not here, right?

10:44.272 --> 10:45.416
Look, let me tell you right now,

10:45.440 --> 10:47.576
this is not the way
you do business.

10:47.578 --> 10:49.258
I don't know what it
is you do around here,

10:49.310 --> 10:51.110
but take note of
this very moment,

10:51.179 --> 10:53.446
and do the exact damn opposite.

10:55.111 --> 10:57.511
What is it you do
around here, anyway?

11:01.380 --> 11:02.621
I'm your A&R guy.

11:02.690 --> 11:04.623
Maurice Jetter.

11:04.692 --> 11:06.625
You needed to vent.

11:09.497 --> 11:11.664
You been handling
this album all wrong.

11:11.733 --> 11:14.834
Ambushing the last president,
storming into Ayanna's office...

11:14.902 --> 11:17.135
I didn't storm in her office.
We had drinks.

11:17.137 --> 11:19.605
No one hangs artists
over balconies anymore

11:19.640 --> 11:21.985
- or jumps on tables during meetings.
- Well, maybe they should.

11:22.009 --> 11:23.909
At least deals got done.

11:23.978 --> 11:25.889
Maybe that's how cats rocked
it in the Mixed Harmony days,

11:25.913 --> 11:27.480
but this is different times.

11:27.548 --> 11:28.948
What you know about
Mixed Harmony?

11:29.016 --> 11:30.516
I have dope taste in music.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.221
Well, good then. You should
know my girls are the dopest.

11:35.256 --> 11:36.489
I'm on their side.

11:36.557 --> 11:38.268
Yeah, and at 3:00 you got
another artist in here.

11:38.292 --> 11:39.859
At 4:00, you got another group.

11:39.927 --> 11:42.695
- Can you even focus?
- Look, I asked to work with your artists

11:42.764 --> 11:45.297
because I see their potential.
Now, our job

11:45.366 --> 11:47.666
is to make sure they're
ready for this album.

11:47.735 --> 11:51.013
- Don't question my focus.
- Then we need producer approval.

11:51.939 --> 11:53.105
You trippin'.

11:53.174 --> 11:55.574
Look, we both know when artists
don't have producer approval,

11:55.610 --> 11:57.042
it's a bad look all around.

11:57.111 --> 11:58.644
Prince, Beyoncé,

11:58.679 --> 12:00.913
- Miley Cyrus, Stevie, Marvin.
- All right, Carlotta.

12:00.982 --> 12:02.948
Look, they all took
control of their careers.

12:03.017 --> 12:05.468
They didn't let nobody
call their shots.

12:07.219 --> 12:08.503
Okay.

12:09.191 --> 12:11.157
Okay, if they kill this
gig at the Underground,

12:11.225 --> 12:14.693
then I can make that ask.

12:14.762 --> 12:16.162
Fair?

12:16.230 --> 12:19.365
I mean, not completely fair,
'cause the record is wack, but...

12:19.433 --> 12:22.142
my girls still gonna
kill it, anyway.

12:22.144 --> 12:23.502
So, fair.

12:25.373 --> 12:27.173
PVC, it's not rocket science.

12:27.241 --> 12:29.875
Ship it here so I can cut it.

12:32.713 --> 12:34.413
You didn't have to
get so dressed up.

12:34.482 --> 12:35.915
I didn't know what to wear.

12:35.983 --> 12:37.283
Hey, mami.

12:37.318 --> 12:39.685
Show me that brown sugar loaf.

12:39.754 --> 12:41.565
Why don't you let me see
what's going on in that dress

12:41.589 --> 12:43.469
so I can sleep good tonight?

12:43.690 --> 12:45.558
If you saw what was going
on under this skirt,

12:45.626 --> 12:46.892
you'd sleep good every night.

12:46.928 --> 12:49.428
- How about a preview?
- Hey, hey.

12:49.463 --> 12:52.103
You talk to my employee like
that again, you're fired.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.066
Chinese ass.

12:54.135 --> 12:55.734
You know, better yet?

12:55.803 --> 12:57.736
Grab your tools and leave.

12:57.805 --> 13:01.106
You're fired. Go!

13:01.142 --> 13:02.541
Elliot.

13:03.707 --> 13:06.045
- I'm here to help you.
- Don't.

13:06.968 --> 13:10.082
Could you just show me
where the office is?

13:23.197 --> 13:25.064
This is our stage?

13:25.132 --> 13:28.033
At least we're close to
the sticky buns place.

13:28.069 --> 13:31.270
I'm-a go check the sound to make
sure at least that's right.

13:31.339 --> 13:33.305
This is not happening to me.

13:33.374 --> 13:35.614
- This is not happening. This...
- Yo, this is happening.

13:35.676 --> 13:38.644
Come on, let's rehearse
these harmonies.

13:38.713 --> 13:40.224
This is Derek's medical insurance.
I got to take it.

13:40.248 --> 13:42.481
Can you do it when
we're done rehearsing?

13:42.550 --> 13:45.117
Damn, that girl is making
all the wrong choices.

13:45.186 --> 13:46.852
Maybe she doesn't
have any choices.

13:46.921 --> 13:48.621
Noah, quick one for the girls?

13:48.689 --> 13:50.133
- Of course.
- They're gonna go crazy.

13:50.157 --> 13:51.991
We're always gonna ride for you.
We love you.

13:52.059 --> 13:54.271
Thank you. Check me on <i> Good
Day Atlanta</i> tomorrow, a'ight?

13:54.295 --> 13:55.895
- Okay.
- Thank you.

13:55.963 --> 13:58.030
You here to see
how it gets down?

13:59.396 --> 14:00.844
I'm just here to get
my sneakers cleaned.

14:00.868 --> 14:03.202
Oh, okay. You just happened
to choose the same mall

14:03.271 --> 14:05.070
Ayanna has us performing at?

14:05.139 --> 14:07.779
But you know if we kill this, she'll
put us on <i> GDA</i> with you, right?

14:07.842 --> 14:10.987
And we will show your ass up, so
you should be a little shook.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.411
Shook?

14:12.480 --> 14:14.680
Three chicks harmonizing in a food court?
Come on, baby.

14:14.715 --> 14:16.317
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, there's Noah.

14:16.319 --> 14:17.650
But stay tuned.

14:17.685 --> 14:19.029
Let me show you what putting
it down looks like.

14:19.053 --> 14:21.420
What's up, baby? How you doing?

14:21.489 --> 14:23.489
This is what desperation
looks like.

14:23.557 --> 14:25.224
You know you came
to see me blow.

14:25.293 --> 14:27.026
And you will.

14:27.094 --> 14:28.694
Ah.

14:28.763 --> 14:30.429
Oops.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.500
Yes, we already filled
out all the paperwork

14:34.568 --> 14:36.135
to see what coverage
he's eligible for.

14:36.203 --> 14:38.971
No, this is not a
pre-existing condition.

14:39.040 --> 14:42.841
How the hell is being paralyzed
a pre-existing condition?

14:42.910 --> 14:45.544
No, I don't want to be
transferred over again.

14:45.546 --> 14:48.614
I been trying to get this
answer for the past three days.

14:49.401 --> 14:50.983
Hell...

14:51.052 --> 14:54.578
- You need to get your head on straight.

Look at her.

18:53.127 --> 18:54.760
Oh, my God, she's crazy.

19:01.446 --> 19:03.776
Now I'm interested.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.143
When I said I wanted you
to smash this performance,

19:11.212 --> 19:13.546
I did not mean my
$10,000 speakers.

19:13.581 --> 19:15.147
Is there some kind
of mental deficiency

19:15.216 --> 19:16.593
I should know about
with you, Alex?

19:16.617 --> 19:18.084
No, no, I'm great.

19:18.152 --> 19:19.496
In fact, since you're
the one that had us...

19:19.520 --> 19:22.254
Sit your non-talented ass down.

19:22.323 --> 19:24.256
Alex, just sh-shut up.

19:24.325 --> 19:26.959
Listen, don't let this one
performance define us.

19:26.995 --> 19:29.328
Um, excuse me, Ms. Ayanna,

19:29.397 --> 19:31.308
do you know what it's like

face with gross food? It's...

19:33.568 --> 19:35.501
It's your job to
make them forget

19:35.536 --> 19:36.747
about stuffing their
face with food.

19:36.771 --> 19:37.815
Make them forget
about everything.

19:37.839 --> 19:39.939

19:40.008 --> 19:41.207

how the hell are you
going to own a stadium?

19:43.598 --> 19:45.811
I don't know. Give
us that album spot

19:45.880 --> 19:47.366

19:47.368 --> 19:50.138

that offensive.

Balls are awesome.

Ayanna, but do you see that?

200,000 views.

20:44.113 --> 20:45.771
That's-that's garbage.

20:46.787 --> 20:50.299
Failed... It could be a
failed prayer, maybe?

21:09.130 --> 21:10.863
Got it, got it.

I found it.

21:14.068 --> 21:15.901

21:15.937 --> 21:18.270
- Shut up!
- No, you shut up!

21:18.339 --> 21:20.306
We know the original
version of "Suga" works.

21:20.374 --> 21:22.286
Yeah, and we know that the
crowd will respond to it.

21:22.310 --> 21:24.150
Yeah, but we also know
that Noah's not gonna do

21:24.178 --> 21:26.145

we might as well.

That's true. We should.

21:30.451 --> 21:32.359
That song is dope and it's new.

21:32.361 --> 21:34.687
We can't do "Suga." It
just blew up in our faces.

blew up in our faces.

21:37.658 --> 21:39.558

close to ready, okay?

- It's not there.

- Oh.
- And now look at you.

keep the girls safe, right?

it was also to help keep me safe, but...

25:05.765 --> 25:08.139
- don't worry about it.

performing after Noah.

26:08.628 --> 26:10.828

one act performing today.

Uh, we actually have to get her

Hey, girls.

26:14.767 --> 26:16.901
Put these on.

26:16.969 --> 26:20.037
- Why?
- You're too shiny for backup singers.

26:21.222 --> 26:23.774
Backup singers... for who?

26:23.810 --> 26:26.710
Oh, you didn't actually think you
would be <i> rewarded</i> for your behavior?

26:26.779 --> 26:28.913

never really left.

27:05.318 --> 27:06.917

assault case last year

27:10.323 --> 27:12.590
- with your former label exec...
- Yeah, well, that label

27:12.658 --> 27:14.158
wasn't a good fit for me.

27:14.227 --> 27:15.926
That's why I came over
to Midtown Sound.

27:15.995 --> 27:18.062

any label I ever been at.

27:18.130 --> 27:20.175

a case that's been closed.

27:20.199 --> 27:22.099
