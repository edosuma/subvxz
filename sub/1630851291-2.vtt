10:04.688 --> 10:06.521
homophobic commentary

10:06.556 --> 10:09.524
She knows nothing about
his sexuality.

10:09.559 --> 10:11.860
He had not labeled himself
as gay,

10:11.895 --> 10:13.895
and she's busy labeling him
that way.

10:13.947 --> 10:19.200
All we want from brooks
is to identify as our son.

10:19.236 --> 10:21.536

I think she's treated better

39:00.222 --> 39:01.788
because of her temper.

39:01.823 --> 39:03.023
I think we all walk
on eggshells

39:03.058 --> 39:04.307
because of her temper.

39:04.359 --> 39:05.725
But you remember when we
started hanging out?

39:05.760 --> 39:07.444
-Listen.
-No, I absolutely agree.

39:07.479 --> 39:08.611
Remember when we started
hanging out?

39:08.647 --> 39:10.113
But it doesn't matter.
If it's done to me,

39:10.148 --> 39:11.364
it's a different--I feel
it's a different standard.

39:11.400 --> 39:14.367
I'm not gonna do it to you,
babe. I don't wanna do it to you

39:14.403 --> 39:17.070
and I don't do it to you,
and I will not do it to you.

39:17.105 --> 39:20.640
The problem is
jen loses her temper,

39:20.675 --> 39:25.145
hurts our feelings, and then
fails to ever make the apology.

39:25.180 --> 39:26.830
And she still cannot seem
to make that connection.

39:26.882 --> 39:29.132
When has she ever said sorry?

39:29.167 --> 39:31.301
I say it for breathing.

39:31.336 --> 39:34.170
So what do we do?
So are you breaking up with me?

39:34.222 --> 39:36.222
I feel like you're breaking up
with me.

39:36.258 --> 39:38.591
-[sighs]
-I've never had a boyfriend,

39:38.626 --> 39:39.893
so I feel like you're
breaking up with me right now.

39:39.928 --> 39:41.061
Is that what's happening?

39:41.096 --> 39:42.695
[sniffles]

39:44.433 --> 39:45.899
I need you to--I need to--
[sniffles]

39:45.934 --> 39:48.234
I need to feel like
you trust me.

39:48.270 --> 39:51.604
That's gonna be hard
for a while.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.307
And that's okay.

39:54.326 --> 39:57.660
I love you
and want to be a friend to you.

39:57.696 --> 40:01.614
And not just
first, second year friend.

40:01.649 --> 40:05.585
Like, cruise control, don't even
have to think about it.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.420
And you know you can
count on me for anything.

40:07.456 --> 40:10.957
That is the type of friend
I will continue to be

40:10.992 --> 40:14.227
if that is what you want.

40:16.264 --> 40:19.382
Otherwise,
we shouldn't be friends

40:19.434 --> 40:22.668
because I will not
suspend my disbelief

40:22.687 --> 40:25.671
when people send me screenshots
with your name on it

40:25.690 --> 40:27.307
that it was made up.

40:27.342 --> 40:29.642
That's too much
of a leap for me.

40:29.677 --> 40:34.114
But I don't care, if you can
just promise to stop doing it.

40:35.951 --> 40:39.068
Look, I don't think
you're racist.

40:39.121 --> 40:41.287
I am sorry for reposting that.

40:41.323 --> 40:44.991
I know I need to make changes,
you know,

40:45.026 --> 40:48.328
in the way I communicate
and all of that.

40:48.363 --> 40:53.699
I know you have been there
for me and stuck up for me.

40:53.718 --> 40:57.253
Like, I appreciate that a lot.

40:57.305 --> 41:03.259
And I am sorry
for not being there for you.

41:03.311 --> 41:07.730
'cause I wasn't. I wasn't even
there for my own family.

41:07.766 --> 41:11.100
No, I...I've been there, too.

41:11.153 --> 41:15.321
I know I can move forward
with heather.

41:15.357 --> 41:20.360
When you get underneath
all that nonsense,

41:20.395 --> 41:22.579
we--we love each other.

41:22.614 --> 41:25.615
She's like the only friend
that can, like,

41:25.667 --> 41:29.118
sing the same rap songs
that I can sing, okay?

41:29.171 --> 41:32.705
Which...Is a lot in utah, okay?

41:34.075 --> 41:36.776
We have churros.

41:36.811 --> 41:39.412
[sizzling]

41:39.431 --> 41:41.130
I don't think you're supposed
to throw that in there.

41:41.183 --> 41:43.783
I don't...Probably not.

41:43.818 --> 41:46.352
[laughs] no, don't--
that's a good churro, man.

41:46.388 --> 41:49.155
Your glove's gonna be
on fire.

41:49.191 --> 41:50.190
No.
You just--you gotta be fast.

41:50.225 --> 41:51.524
Oh, my gosh.

41:51.560 --> 41:52.692
Haven't you ever camped before?

41:52.727 --> 41:54.527
There's two more. No.

41:54.563 --> 41:58.615
First of all,
let's eat a friendship churro.

41:58.650 --> 42:00.733
[crunches]

42:00.768 --> 42:03.436
I just burnt my tongue.

42:03.471 --> 42:04.604
[laughs]

42:06.658 --> 42:09.792
<i> next time on "the real</i>
<i> housewives of salt lake city"..</i>

42:09.828 --> 42:12.612
-Go!
-Aah! [laughs]

42:12.631 --> 42:15.415
aah! [laughing]

42:15.450 --> 42:18.167
I think we should have
more children.

42:18.220 --> 42:20.620
Honestly, you know how
I feel about this, right?

42:20.639 --> 42:22.555
I want more kids.

42:22.591 --> 42:24.591
I'm not gonna untie my tubes.

42:24.626 --> 42:26.092
Do you think when you go away
to college,

42:26.127 --> 42:30.163
you'll wanna go to church?
-Not the mormon church, no.

42:30.198 --> 42:32.565
I'm planning an adventure outing
for the girls.

42:32.601 --> 42:34.684
It's time for us to get out
of our comfort zone.

42:34.736 --> 42:37.237
-Let's do this.
-You got a fish.

42:37.272 --> 42:38.321
Let's see if we have dinner
tonight.

42:38.356 --> 42:40.673
That's an appetizer.

42:40.709 --> 42:44.110
There are homophobic tweets
regarding my son's sexuality

42:44.145 --> 42:45.478
that you have liked.

42:45.497 --> 42:48.147
I have somebody that runs
my stuff. That is not me.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.749
It's your ----ing twitter, jen!

42:49.784 --> 42:52.201
I'm done. Is she ----ing
out of her mind?!

42:52.254 --> 42:53.536
I can't listen to
the projecting, deflecting,

42:53.588 --> 42:54.654
and lying anymore.
I've had enough.

42:54.673 --> 42:58.291
She's disengaging,
so I'm gonna let her disengage.
