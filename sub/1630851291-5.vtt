Hi! Playing the piano?

10:04.488 --> 10:06.471
-Did it come?
-Yeah.

10:06.506 --> 10:09.157
I just log into the portal,
and it'll, like, say on there.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.042
-Okay, but--
-but I've been looking, like,

10:11.078 --> 10:12.243
on instagram at all the people
who have gotten it.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.279

mine will be likewise.

10:18.135 --> 10:20.352
Okay, log in. Use my computer.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.304
So ashley's applied
to a number of colleges.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.292
This is my dream school, though.
Like, my top choice for sure.

10:28.312 --> 10:31.346
Ucsb in santa barbara is one
of her top choices,

10:31.398 --> 10:32.981

focusing on it.

10:33.016 --> 10:34.983
-It's so exciting.
-I know. I'm scared.

10:35.018 --> 10:36.501

if you don't get in?

10:36.536 --> 10:37.852

10:52.252 --> 10:53.818

10:53.837 --> 10:55.170

-look at the confetti.
-And I'm so happy for you.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.926
It feels like a big payday
as a parent,

11:01.962 --> 11:05.847

the relentless grind, you know,

11:05.882 --> 11:08.183

your homework?"

11:08.218 --> 11:10.518

driving them to their classes.

11:10.554 --> 11:13.722

11:15.242 --> 11:16.741
I'm so proud of you!
This is a top tier school.

11:16.777 --> 11:19.110
-This is amazing.
-I'm so happy.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.413

It's like a whole new life.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.850
Like, you're gonna meet people
from all over the nation.

11:25.869 --> 11:27.535
You won't just meet people
from, like,

11:27.571 --> 11:28.870
you won't be asking people,

11:28.905 --> 11:30.205
"what high school
did you go to?"

11:30.240 --> 11:31.389
you'll be asking them, like,
"where are you from?" you know?

11:31.425 --> 11:32.290
Totally.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.393
It's just gonna expand
your whole world.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.862
She's never left the bubble
of salt lake city.

11:37.881 --> 11:41.299
She's never even left our home.
It's like she's been eating

11:41.334 --> 11:43.168

to see all the options.

school you applied for,

schools to choose from.

11:53.563 --> 11:55.430
Even pepperdine, I was like,
oh, I might wanna go there,

31:47.156 --> 31:50.123

31:58.834 --> 32:00.533
before you sent her off,
or how did you do it?

32:00.552 --> 32:04.704
So I mean, we've had a million
conversations over the years.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.924
-Right.
-My kids were very open with me

32:06.976 --> 32:10.394
about everything that went on
more or less sexually

32:10.429 --> 32:13.230
and where they kind of,
like, got

32:13.265 --> 32:14.748
from point "a" to "b" to "c,"
you know?

32:14.783 --> 32:15.616
I mean, it's a new thing for me
to worry about,

32:15.651 --> 32:19.102
because before,
I never even worried

32:19.154 --> 32:21.688
because in my mind,
I was so mormon

32:21.723 --> 32:23.073
that it wasn't even
a possibility or a concern

32:23.108 --> 32:24.358
because she's just gonna be
a virgin

32:24.393 --> 32:26.893
till the day she gets married
so nobody's gonna talk about it,

32:26.912 --> 32:28.996
because it's an absolute.

32:29.031 --> 32:32.616
So you're saying you haven't had
any conversations about sex?

32:32.668 --> 32:34.201
Um...

32:34.236 --> 32:36.753
Like a real conversation
about sex with ashley

32:36.789 --> 32:38.872
or--or any other girls?

32:38.907 --> 32:41.574
I can't even barely say
those words to<i> you.</i>

32:41.593 --> 32:43.010
Okay, I do think one thing--

32:43.045 --> 32:44.628
because it feels like it's
writing a permission slip

32:44.680 --> 32:48.765
to be like, "if you're not
having sex, something's wrong,"

32:48.801 --> 32:50.934
and this is a different message
than I've ever given them.

32:50.970 --> 32:53.854
Since they were born, it was,
"get straight a's,"

32:53.889 --> 32:55.522
and they are abstinent.

32:55.557 --> 32:58.325
-Like, those were our rules.
-Those are the rules.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.893
My parents never had a sex talk
with me.

32:59.928 --> 33:01.561
The only sex talk we had was,

33:01.596 --> 33:04.498
"absolutely don't do it
under any circumstances ever.

33:04.533 --> 33:05.932
Ever."

33:05.968 --> 33:07.767
she's had a boyfriend
for a couple of years, right?

33:07.786 --> 33:09.703
Two years, yeah.

33:09.738 --> 33:12.155
And has she talked with you
about sex with him at all?

33:12.207 --> 33:13.790
Yeah, I mean,
we've talked about it,

33:13.826 --> 33:16.827
and at the time, she said,
"not yet."

33:16.879 --> 33:19.279
so what's there to worry about
on that front?

33:19.298 --> 33:21.164
Well, I just wanna know
the language,

33:21.216 --> 33:23.300
because in the context
of my culture,

33:23.335 --> 33:26.353
there is no language
except for absolutely no,

33:26.388 --> 33:32.225
because it will sabotage
your ability to get married,

33:32.261 --> 33:35.345
to be a good wife,
and to be a good mother.

33:35.397 --> 33:38.098
The first time I really
figured out what sex was,

33:38.133 --> 33:40.067
I was over at my friend's house,
and we were watching "taps."

33:40.102 --> 33:43.670
and we knew what time the, uh,
naked scene came on,

33:43.706 --> 33:45.672
so we had to, like, hold
a towel up over the tv screen

33:45.708 --> 33:47.824
so that we wouldn't see
the boobs.

33:47.860 --> 33:52.579
But then she showed me a book
that all I can remember is it

33:52.614 --> 33:55.182
was a pop-up book where
you, like, pulled the things,

33:55.217 --> 33:58.051
and it had two chickens, and I
could pull the little thing

33:58.087 --> 34:01.371
and see the chickens doing it,
and I realized, like,

34:01.423 --> 34:04.925
what I had--it, like,
all kinda came together.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.094
It's just fascinating to me
because a year ago,

34:07.129 --> 34:10.764
I would've been horrified

34:10.799 --> 34:13.666
if she was considering having
sex before she got married,

34:13.685 --> 34:18.671
and now I am horrified
at the thought of her not

34:18.690 --> 34:21.041
having sex
before she gets married.

34:21.076 --> 34:23.110
If ashley were to tell me that
she wanted to wait to have sex

34:23.145 --> 34:24.394
until after she was married,

34:24.446 --> 34:26.730
the first question I would
ask her would be, "why?"

34:26.782 --> 34:29.566
because I would be afraid
that she would feel that way

34:29.618 --> 34:31.818
because of the way
that I had raised her.

34:31.853 --> 34:35.205
My whole life, I thought
everything that wasn't mormon

34:35.240 --> 34:37.124
was off the rails,

34:37.159 --> 34:40.293
and so I don't even know how
to, like, build a bridge

34:40.329 --> 34:41.528
to the other world.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.830

-I would do one of each.
-Okay, let's do that.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.211
-You wanna do that?
-That's not--

38:18.246 --> 38:19.145
will you share with me?

38:19.181 --> 38:20.613
Yeah, just bring a bigger slice
of apple.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.448
-Okay.
-'cause I'm allergic to pecans.

38:21.483 --> 38:23.833
-Oh.
-We don't need an epipen, do we?

38:23.885 --> 38:25.585
-No.
-Well, depending on

38:25.620 --> 38:26.920
this conversation,
we'll see if we need one.

38:26.955 --> 38:28.688
-Well, we might.
-[laughter]

38:30.258 --> 38:31.725
-do you have a problem with me?
-No, I don't--

38:31.760 --> 38:33.426
is there something about me
that bothers you...

38:33.461 --> 38:35.011
-No.
-...That you don't like...

38:35.063 --> 38:36.513
-Not at all.
-...That you don't want around?

38:36.565 --> 38:38.014
No, not at all. Not at all.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.599
So everything that
has been said to this point

38:39.634 --> 38:43.470
and done to this point
is a misunderstanding?

38:43.505 --> 38:45.855
I think it's a misunderstanding.

38:45.907 --> 38:48.975
I wanna understand why
the other night at casino night,

38:48.994 --> 38:50.977
when I walked into the room,

38:50.996 --> 38:52.529
you go,
"what is<i> this</i> doing here?"

38:52.581 --> 38:54.581
-this is what I wanna know--
-you and heather

38:54.616 --> 38:55.582
were relentless with me,
and I was like,

38:55.617 --> 38:58.618
"why are you seeking out
a friendship with this?"

38:58.653 --> 38:59.853
oh, "with<i> this."</i>

38:59.888 --> 39:01.054
with this person
that's going for me.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.722
"with<i> this."</i>

39:02.758 --> 39:04.624
oh, I didn't mean it like that.

39:04.659 --> 39:07.994
The problem was, is like,
I didn't want anyone else

39:08.013 --> 39:09.996
coming into our conversation.

39:10.015 --> 39:14.768
Like, what I meant to say is
"this one," like you,

39:14.803 --> 39:16.853
like,
whitney coming in here for--

39:16.888 --> 39:19.055
my name. When you say
very rude things,

39:19.107 --> 39:22.008
how am I misunderstanding
your intention?

39:22.044 --> 39:24.027
Well, I think, like,
from my perspective,

39:24.062 --> 39:26.346
I feel like everyone's thinking
that they know

39:26.381 --> 39:28.448
what I'm thinking, feeling...

39:28.483 --> 39:32.986
I'm not just saying what I feel
about you to, like, be rude.

39:33.021 --> 39:36.740
When you tell angie, "don't
claim her as your cousin,"

39:36.792 --> 39:38.074
how's that--how does that look

39:38.126 --> 39:40.744
like you're being
misinterpreted?

39:40.796 --> 39:41.861
Yeah, I totally get
where you're coming from.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.830
-And do you realize how rude...
-It's understand--

39:43.865 --> 39:46.366
...And demeaning it is to tell
someone don't claim them

39:46.401 --> 39:48.051
as your relative?
-I didn't mean it that way.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.336
I've been friends with angie
for 25 years.

39:50.371 --> 39:53.056
If I saw her having discord
with somebody else,

39:53.091 --> 39:56.259
I would never seek out
that person,

39:56.311 --> 39:58.044
and I felt like she was
seeking you out,

39:58.063 --> 39:59.729
and I think that
that's where, like,

39:59.765 --> 40:03.683
you're sensing my, like,
defensive energy.

40:03.718 --> 40:06.019
Oh, my gosh.
That looks amazing. Thank you.

40:06.054 --> 40:07.570
This is
the white cheddar cheese.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.255
-Thank you.
-Yum. Thank you.

40:09.291 --> 40:11.491
So good. Thank you.

40:11.526 --> 40:14.110
Um...

40:14.162 --> 40:16.362
Whitney, I just think we have
a bunch of miscommunications.

40:16.397 --> 40:18.698
I feel no anger towards you.
I feel no hostility towards you.

40:18.733 --> 40:21.734
I feel nothing but, like,
oh, my gosh, like,

40:21.753 --> 40:23.036
she doesn't get me,
and then for me--

40:23.071 --> 40:24.904
well, you've never allowed me
to get you.

40:24.940 --> 40:27.090
[mouth full] I'll give you that.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.925
You have drove me crazy
at times.

40:28.960 --> 40:29.976
-I'm sorry about that.
-But--

40:30.011 --> 40:32.295
it wasn't my intention.

40:32.347 --> 40:34.130
I haven't really wanted
to get to know you

40:34.182 --> 40:36.933
after all of that,
but I keep finding myself

40:36.968 --> 40:39.636
being bothered by you...
-[laughs]

40:39.688 --> 40:41.821
...And irritated by you.

40:41.857 --> 40:44.641
So I'm really trying to dive
into what does that mean.

40:44.693 --> 40:47.143
-Mm-hmm.
-Because that tells me maybe

40:47.195 --> 40:50.430
I do want to be your friend,
and all of your friends

40:50.465 --> 40:52.765
tell me, "no, lisa's amazing.
Lisa's kind,"

40:52.784 --> 40:56.536
and I'm like, I would love
to know that lisa.

40:56.571 --> 41:00.457
I'm so sick and tired of being
on the hamster wheel with lisa

41:00.492 --> 41:02.175
and arguing with her.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.128
I really just hope that we can
get to a point

41:05.163 --> 41:08.164
where truly we just leave
the past in the past

41:08.216 --> 41:11.000
and move on.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.303
I mean, like, where do you think
we go from here?

41:13.338 --> 41:17.056
Like, I'm open and wanting
to get to know you more.

41:17.092 --> 41:21.427
I'm a sag. Like, I just wanna
free fly and be fun,

41:21.463 --> 41:25.298
like, maneuver through, like,
life, having a good time.

41:25.317 --> 41:26.966
Well, you know I'm a libra
and that's...

41:26.985 --> 41:28.151
-Yeah.
-...I'm the same way.

41:28.186 --> 41:30.136
Yeah, so we should be
flying together.

41:30.172 --> 41:32.689
So just help me understand
one thing.

41:32.741 --> 41:36.075
Like, it just hurts me that
I get called those names...

41:36.111 --> 41:37.911
-Mm-hmm.
-...And, you know, being asked

41:37.946 --> 41:39.879
to not be claimed by a friend,

41:39.915 --> 41:42.365
but I can forgive that.
-Mm-hmm.

41:42.417 --> 41:46.619
Um...I just think we need
to spend time

41:46.654 --> 41:50.507
so that we can...Move past that.
-Mm-hmm.

41:50.542 --> 41:51.958
'cause if you're saying
that's not your intention...

41:51.993 --> 41:53.710
It's not my intention,

41:53.762 --> 41:55.828
and I know that there's gonna be
some things that set us back.

41:55.847 --> 41:58.214
I hope that we can, like,
reset and be like,

41:58.266 --> 41:59.465
"nope. I'm giving
the benefit of the doubt there."

42:14.065 --> 42:15.365
-whoo!
-Go, lisa!

42:15.400 --> 42:17.116
[laughs]

42:17.152 --> 42:19.035
my mom and dad
did not sit me down

42:19.070 --> 42:20.653
and have
a birds and bees conversation.

42:20.688 --> 42:23.239
When a man and a woman...

42:24.292 --> 42:26.192
[laughs]

42:26.228 --> 42:27.961
-how are you?
-Good. How are you doing?

42:27.996 --> 42:30.747
It's a little strange that
lisa chose this restaurant

42:30.799 --> 42:32.465
for our date tonight.

42:32.500 --> 42:33.566
So I walked into a trap tonight.

42:33.602 --> 42:35.001
-No. No.
-Here I was, thinking

42:35.036 --> 42:36.035
that lisa wanted to be
my friend.

42:36.071 --> 42:37.870
-Whitney.
-You brought me here...

42:37.906 --> 42:40.406
-Oh, my god.
-...To cover your tracks.

42:40.442 --> 42:42.108
♪♪♪

42:42.143 --> 42:46.079
I have 13 pregnancy, and I
end up with 3 living kids...

42:46.114 --> 42:48.414
-Oh, my god.
-...And one stillbirth.

42:48.450 --> 42:51.818
My daughter passed away
when she was 42 weeks.

42:51.853 --> 42:53.286
I think we should have
more children.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.521
You know I don't wanna have
any more kids.

42:55.557 --> 42:57.290
Why don't we get a sister wife?
