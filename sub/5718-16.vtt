WEBVTT

00:03.837 --> 00:05.039
Hey.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.574
Dave got invited
to a birthday party.

00:06.640 --> 00:07.975
Legit or entire class?

00:09.143 --> 00:10.478
Does it matter?

00:10.544 --> 00:12.480
No, it does not.
Hmm.

00:12.546 --> 00:14.582
Let's savor the victory.

00:14.648 --> 00:17.285
Okay, I need to be
picked up at 3 o'clock
sharp today.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.019
And bring a snack,
'cause you'll be
driving me to yoga

00:19.087 --> 00:21.622
and waiting in the car,
and I know you get grumpy
when you don't eat,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.257
and that'll harsh
my Zen.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.494
Thanks, Mom.
Bye.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.530
Yoga, huh?
Maybe I should try that.
I've been so stressed out.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.499
Okay, Molly!
Have a great day!

00:31.565 --> 00:32.666
What's that, sweet pea?

00:32.733 --> 00:34.034
Okay! I'll have
a great day, too.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.369
(CHUCKLES)

00:35.436 --> 00:38.372
Oh, a hug?
You got it!
Get over here!

00:40.040 --> 00:43.144
Man, it's like
she doesn't even
acknowledge that I exist.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.645
She used to be
all about me.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.180
Remember when she
was a baby?

00:46.247 --> 00:49.883
We used to hear her
on the monitor saying,
"Dada. Dada."

00:49.950 --> 00:52.753
Yeah. And then you
would wake me up
and make me go in?

00:53.687 --> 00:54.855
Oh, I'm sorry, Al.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.225
I guess I should have
breastfed her.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.293
I just miss how close
we used to be.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.629
It's just a phase.
She's a teenager.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.897
Her brain's telling her
to only think about herself.

01:03.964 --> 01:06.300
So, she gets to pretend
I don't exist,

01:06.367 --> 01:07.901
and I just have to deal
with it?

01:07.968 --> 01:09.570
That doesn't sound
very me.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.241
Well, why don't you try
and do more
things with her?

01:13.307 --> 01:14.742
It's hard.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.745
When she was, like, 13,
I used to take her shopping
at Forever 21,

01:17.811 --> 01:19.313
but now she never wants
to go with me.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.149
I don't blame her.

01:21.215 --> 01:22.950
Nobody wants to spend
four hours watching
you try on overalls.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.520
Look,
if it really bugs you,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.122
you could make
more of an effort.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.857
Or I could just double down
on Dave.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.392
Can boys wear wedges?

01:31.459 --> 01:34.295
I thought it'd be cool
if I showed up
to the party taller.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.866
Yeah, I'll figure
something out with Molly.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.606
Yo!

01:45.673 --> 01:46.674
'Sup?
Holla.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.075
What it do.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.212
So, my friend Joanne
is trying to unload

01:51.279 --> 01:52.913
some tickets to a boy band
concert tomorrow

01:52.980 --> 01:55.149
'cause her daughter
called her a bitch.

01:55.216 --> 01:58.018
So, you guys heard
of a group called Emblem3?

01:58.085 --> 02:00.020
(ALL GASP)
E3?

02:00.087 --> 02:01.789
Molly loves them!

02:01.855 --> 02:03.957
I remember
when they were first
on The X Factor.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.826
It was like,
(SCREAMING)
"Oh, my God!

02:05.893 --> 02:08.929
"You got to get in here
and see this now!"

02:08.996 --> 02:11.399
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
And Molly was like,
"What is it, Dad?"

02:12.566 --> 02:15.303
E3 is the best.

02:15.369 --> 02:17.971
Wesley and Keaton
and Drew are amazing.

02:18.038 --> 02:19.373
And, fun fan fact,

02:19.440 --> 02:21.209
Drew's favorite color
is glitter.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.412
What?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.113
I'm lonely.
You know this.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.016
Who wants the tickets?

02:29.082 --> 02:30.551
Ooh! Ooh! Me!
(LAUGHS)

02:30.618 --> 02:32.386
Ha! Seniority!
In your face!

02:32.453 --> 02:34.255
(LAUGHS)

02:34.322 --> 02:35.823
I'm gonna take Molly
and her friends.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.291
I've been looking
to do more stuff with her,

02:37.358 --> 02:40.060
and this is stuff!
(LAUGHS)

02:40.127 --> 02:41.195
So, how much?

02:41.262 --> 02:42.296
$50 each.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.997
Damn, Gina!
(LAUGHS)

02:46.667 --> 02:48.269
Kidding. It's fine.
I'm a doctor.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.908
Damona.
I got you a chai latte.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.810
Ah.
This says, "Carlos."

02:57.878 --> 02:59.613
Don't worry about it.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.085
So, I know it's not
going great for Carlos,

03:05.152 --> 03:06.620
but how are things
with you and Pat?

03:06.687 --> 03:08.356
(SIGHS)
I don't know.

03:08.422 --> 03:09.757
At first,
it was exciting,

03:09.823 --> 03:11.659
but now it feels like
the wind has kind of died

03:11.725 --> 03:13.394
and the anchor
is dragging

03:13.461 --> 03:14.928
and I think
I've been spending
too much time

03:14.995 --> 03:16.196
on his damn boat.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.300
(SIGHS)
I got to end this.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.801
Okay.
Here's what you do.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.504
Give him a reason
to break up with you.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.507
Like fake
your grandmother's death

03:26.574 --> 03:28.342
and then subtly hint

03:28.409 --> 03:30.778
that you are
the police's
number-one suspect.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.816
Or...
You could just rip
the Band-Aid off

03:35.883 --> 03:37.217
and end it for good.

03:37.285 --> 03:41.188
That's what
Topher and I do
every time we break up.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.990
Yeah,
I think you're right.
Okay.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.058
Three reasons
why my way is better

03:45.125 --> 03:48.429
Joe, Nando, and Nando T.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.264
They all believe
I killed my grandmother,

03:50.331 --> 03:52.165
and they all dumped me
because of it.

03:52.232 --> 03:56.169
So...
Who is the
relationship expert now?

03:56.770 --> 03:58.539
Girls, boom.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.981
Well, the race
for Father of the Year
is heating up,

04:08.048 --> 04:10.518
and I'm the early favorite
to bring home a Daddy.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.253
(CHUCKLES)

04:13.321 --> 04:15.289
You know,
that's what they would call it
if they had an award show.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.690
Anyone mind
if I take
another run at this?

04:16.757 --> 04:18.359
Thank you.
Okay. Great.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.860
Hey, Mol.
Guess what?

04:19.927 --> 04:23.030
Tomorrow afternoon,
you're gonna see Emblem3!

04:23.096 --> 04:24.498
What?
(SCREAMS)

04:24.565 --> 04:26.567
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh!

04:27.635 --> 04:28.902
That's right.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.671
I'm taking you
and your besties
to see

04:30.738 --> 04:34.241
what Tiger Beat and I call
"California's
most kissable band."

04:35.275 --> 04:36.977
Wait.
You're taking me?

04:37.044 --> 04:40.314
Yeah, totally.
It's gonna be stupid.
(CHUCKLES)

04:40.381 --> 04:42.750
Me, you,
and our entire squad.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.753
Our squad?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.087
Mom, can't you take us?

04:47.154 --> 04:48.656
I'm taking Dave
to a birthday party.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.391
Legit or entire class?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.993
Does it matter?
Let's just savor
the victory.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.665
Okay. I guess
Dad'll take us.
Beggars can't be choosers.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.199
No, they cannot.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.935
Tammy. Guess what.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.637
We're gonna go
see Emblem3!

05:03.704 --> 05:04.972
(SCREAMS)

05:05.573 --> 05:07.908
(SCREAMS)

05:07.975 --> 05:10.678
Dad, please!
I'm trying to have
a conversation.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.113
(SCREAMS)

05:18.386 --> 05:20.988
Keaton just
Insta'd himself
with his shirt off.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.222
I am dead.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.658
No way.
Screen shot
and text it to me.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.762
Did you see
his girlfriend?

05:28.829 --> 05:31.098
Basic.
(SCOFFS) Lol!

05:32.700 --> 05:35.068
He means LOL.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.571
Um, so, have you seen
Emblem's new video?

05:37.638 --> 05:39.873
Yes. Oh, my God.
It's so great.
Um, like 100 times.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.743
Am I wrong
or does Wesley have,
like, a Gosling quality?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.213
Dad, seriously stop.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.449
Just put on Emblem3.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.685
What? Why would you
want to listen to a band
we're about to see?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.387
It's gonna
ruin the magic.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.122
If you order steak
for your entree,

05:55.188 --> 05:57.157
would you also
order steak
for your appetizer?

05:57.224 --> 05:59.226
I wouldn't know.
I'm a pescatarian.

05:59.292 --> 06:02.396
Oh, so fish are just
garbage animals
you can slaughter at will?

06:02.463 --> 06:04.231
Come on, Tammy.
Let's be honest
with ourselves.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.702
Okay,
who's ready
to crack open

06:08.769 --> 06:11.038
those pressed juices
I got at the juicery

06:11.104 --> 06:13.474
where all the cool,
healthy teens hang out?

06:13.541 --> 06:15.075
'Cause that place
is my jam.

06:17.445 --> 06:18.612
Ohmga!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.815
He means OMG.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.889
Oh, no!
What happened?

06:28.956 --> 06:30.758
Dave was
chasing a butterfly
at a birthday party,

06:30.824 --> 06:32.259
and he stepped
on a rusty nail.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.127
It wouldn't have gone
through my shoe

06:34.194 --> 06:35.863
if you'd let me wear
the wedges.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.732
Ken's at a concert

06:38.799 --> 06:40.834
and the emergency room
is always packed,
so I brought him here.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.636
Good thinking.
Around these parts,

06:42.703 --> 06:44.404
you will always be
a V.I.P.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.707
That's
a Very Important Park.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.042
Ken would have
loved that,

06:49.109 --> 06:51.679
not because it's funny
but because
it's all about him.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.014
Come on, sir.
Let's get you cleaned up.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.116
So, hey, does your dad
ever talk about me
at home?

06:56.183 --> 06:57.551
Nope.
Okay.

06:58.486 --> 06:59.620
Okay.
Here's the deal.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.221
I know Dave needs
a tetanus booster,

07:01.288 --> 07:02.623
but he's deathly afraid
of needles.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.092
Oh, don't worry.
I'm great with kids.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.494
I was one.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.062
(LAUGHS)

07:09.129 --> 07:11.431
That's what I tell them.
They love it.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.802
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:14.868 --> 07:17.337
Okay, just one more thing.
Have you had
your tetanus shot?

07:17.404 --> 07:22.175
Yeah. Why?
He will bite
if he feels cornered.

07:22.242 --> 07:25.012
If you don't believe me,
ask our neighbor's dog.
He knows.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.983
Okay, okay.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.652
I'm gonna get us
some snacks,
so stay in your seats.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.086
I don't want you
getting into trouble.

07:33.153 --> 07:34.622
I mean, of course,
YOLO and everything,

07:34.688 --> 07:37.691
but stay aware
of your surroundings
because, again, YOLO.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.628
I'll go with you.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.296
Yeah, you will.
My dawg. YOLO!

07:45.332 --> 07:47.601
Dad, if your behavior
doesn't change,

07:47.668 --> 07:49.469
you are no longer
my father.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.171
Wow. Cold as ice.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.273
But hanging
with our squad
is my jam.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.475
Stop saying
everything is your jam.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.410
Geez.
Anything else?
Yeah.

07:57.477 --> 08:01.114
Here's a list
of other things you need
to never do again.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.150
"No using terms
like 'YOLO.'

08:03.216 --> 08:06.386
"No asking questions
about boyfriends.
No interacting?"

08:06.453 --> 08:07.755
Why don't I just go wait
in the car?

08:07.821 --> 08:08.822
Scroll down.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.091
"Go wait in the car."
Oh, okay.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.459
I'll text you
during the encore

08:12.526 --> 08:13.927
so you can put
the seat warmers on.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.630
Make sure you turn
Tammy's on high.
Her butt runs cold.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.499
First concert
with your daughter?

08:19.567 --> 08:20.834
How could you tell?

08:20.901 --> 08:23.370
We overheard her
giving you the list.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.673
We've all gotten
the list.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.241
My daughter
laminated mine.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.678
My daughter made mine
the wallpaper
on my iPhone.

08:30.744 --> 08:33.714
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
I don't know
how to change it.

08:33.781 --> 08:35.883
But you don't have
to stand here
and take it.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.384
Where else am I gonna go?

08:37.450 --> 08:39.352
A parents' lounge?

08:39.419 --> 08:41.154
Hells, yeah!

08:41.221 --> 08:43.624
Who needs my self-absorbed
she-devil of a daughter

08:43.691 --> 08:45.793
when I could be absorbing
some of that SauvyB?

08:45.859 --> 08:47.861
(CHUCKLES)
That's my jam!

08:47.928 --> 08:50.163
"My jam."
What a fresh expression.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.072
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

08:59.139 --> 09:02.409
Ah, Damona.
My professional coworker.

09:02.475 --> 09:04.477
Hang on.
(HUMMING)

09:08.982 --> 09:10.784
M'lady.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.487
Pat, listen.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.124
I've been having
a lot of fun with you...

09:17.190 --> 09:18.859
Okay.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.327
I think I know
where you're headed
with this.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.930
Oh, that is such
a relief.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.965
We need

Here's the thing.

09:38.712 --> 09:42.049
My grandmother just died,
and I'm the police's
number-one suspect.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.451
Not a big deal.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.586
I can provide you
with an airtight alibi.

09:48.555 --> 09:49.923
So...

09:54.795 --> 09:56.997
Dave, I get
being scared of shots.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.767
I know a lot about kids.
I was one.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.338
Okay.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.675
Look,
this will just feel
like a minor bee sting.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.042
Oh, I got stung once.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.443
See?
Not so bad, right?

10:10.510 --> 10:12.545
I was allergic,
and my throat closed up.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.383
It was the most painful
and terrifying experience
of my young life.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.621
Okay.
Ixnay on the eestingbay.

10:21.689 --> 10:23.323
I speak pig Latin.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.059
A meeting of the minds.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.830
This'll be quick.
I promise.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.832
Fine.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.500
Can I get
a glass of water first?

10:33.566 --> 10:34.935
Sure, kiddo.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.538
We are a go for the shot,

than being shunned
by your daughter?

11:06.767 --> 11:08.702
Ugh.
Completely.
Oh.

11:08.769 --> 11:11.604
It's like one day
she woke up in a bad mood
and it never went away.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.873
And that was
three years ago.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.341

11:14.407 --> 11:16.609
Oh. That's nothing.

calling me "Mom" and
started calling me "Sheryl."

11:20.580 --> 11:22.015
My name is Lynda.

Well, on the bright side,
they'll be off
to college soon,

11:26.820 --> 11:29.556
and we can turn
their rooms
into home gyms.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.558
We're turning Kara's
into an extra bedroom.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.326
Because she wrecked
our marriage.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.265
All I know is
it's gotten a lot easier
with Amy

11:38.331 --> 11:39.632
since I've given up.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.902
Okay, wait.
You've given up?

11:41.969 --> 11:44.237
Oh, God, yeah.
We all have.
More wine?

11:44.304 --> 11:46.874
No, wait.
It's just
temporary, right?

11:50.177 --> 11:53.580
Okay, no.
I know I'm hilarious,
but I'm being serious.

11:53.646 --> 11:54.948
She's going through
a phase.

Amen.
Mmm-hmm.

You guys may have given up,
but that's not gonna be me.

Because I love my daughter,
and I'm gonna go be with her.

that's gonna stand in the way

goes to Mr. Pat's office,

'cause it's the color
of El Diablo.

And this green key goes
to Mr. Dr. Ken's office,

15:18.485 --> 15:20.920
because he's jealous
that Mr. Pat got
the red key.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.990
And this key goes
to a locker
at the airport

15:23.056 --> 15:24.657
that my cousin RonJulio
gave to me

in my office?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.102

I stepped on a nail,

16:09.169 --> 16:12.605
and now those
sadistic monsters
are trying to give me a shot.

can be important.

from Bangkok,

I got a shot that saved me
from going blind.

that smart cardigan

I do know is I've got

No, you weren't.
You were hopped up
on sleep meds.

and you were buying
a kayak online.

I got to check
that prescription.

I mean, at one point,
we did have a moment
when I was onstage

19:59.165 --> 20:00.800
and Molly and I did
the heart thing
to each other.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.669
Wait.
You were onstage?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.003
For a bit.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.938
Until I got pancaked
by a giant security guard.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.007
Also tased me.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.576
Anyway,
on the ride home,

20:09.642 --> 20:11.778
the only thing she said
to me was that
I was embarrassing.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.247
Embarrassing
is not terrible.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.616
It's not like she said
she never wants
to see you again.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.150
Or she put Post-its
on your sweaters

20:18.217 --> 20:19.752
saying,
"Don't wear me."

20:19.819 --> 20:21.921
Oh, yeah.
Those Post-its
were totally from Molly.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.825
Hey, Dave.
Spoke to Clark.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.895
I heard you created
quite a stir at the
hamo yesterday.

20:28.961 --> 20:29.996
HMO.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.033
Yes. I don't know
how you work with that Julie.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.868
She sucks you in
with the cartoony voice,

20:35.935 --> 20:37.970
but she is quick
to the needle.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.573
Mom,
I'm taking the car

20:40.640 --> 20:42.609
to meet Tammy
at Yogurtland then Drybar.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.844
We're doing
a froyo and blow.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.313
Have a great day, Dad.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.915
Cool.
You, too, Mol.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.184
(DOOR CLOSES)
(SQUEALS)

20:52.251 --> 20:54.321
Kiss on the cheek!
(LAUGHS)

20:54.387 --> 20:56.289
That is my jam!

20:56.356 --> 20:58.791
Daddy's gonna have
a good day.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.793
* Kiss on the cheek
