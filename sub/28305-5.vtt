WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:03.699
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
All righty,
you'll recall Jane was in love

00:03.742 --> 00:06.441
with her baby daddy Rafael and
they even moved in together.

00:06.484 --> 00:07.964
And while Jane was moving out,

00:08.008 --> 00:10.619
Alba's pretend husband
Jorge was moving in.

00:10.662 --> 00:13.448
So, yes, the Villanuevas
were making strides.

00:13.491 --> 00:16.973
But then, Jane's ex-husband Michael returned from the dead.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.496
And he wanted her back.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.368
Do you still love him?I don't know.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.283
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Straight
out of a telenovela, right?

00:22.326 --> 00:23.371
Well, imagine this.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.546
Rogelio's baby mama Darci

00:24.589 --> 00:26.809
was dating
his archrival, Esteban.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.637
And Petra? Well, you'll recall

00:28.680 --> 00:30.856
her crazy ex-husband Milos
was out to get her.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.120
But J.R. came to the rescue.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.339
And then Petra did
the right thing for once.

00:35.383 --> 00:38.342
Are you sure you want
to call police on man that owns

00:38.386 --> 00:40.562
two-thirds of Marbella Hotel?

00:40.605 --> 00:42.825
NARRATOR: Because she loved J.R.

00:42.868 --> 00:45.523
And friends, they finally
got back together.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.872
J.R., I mean it.

00:46.916 --> 00:51.007
I will never lie to you
again, ever. I love you.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.835
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I know, romantic, right?

00:52.878 --> 00:54.663
So what could go wrong?

00:54.706 --> 00:58.667
When Jane Gloriana Villanueva
was 29 years,

00:58.710 --> 01:00.669
eleven months
and seven days old,

01:00.712 --> 01:03.976
she was exactly three weeks
away from turning...

01:04.020 --> 01:08.198
30? O-M-G, that is so old.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.721
Whoa.

01:09.765 --> 01:13.029
Well, I don't feel old, Mateo.
I feel great.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.987
Like I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.380
ROGELIO:
Agreed.

01:16.424 --> 01:19.775
And, by the way,
is there anything in particular

01:19.818 --> 01:22.821
you were thinking of doing
to mark the occasion?

01:22.865 --> 01:24.519
What?

01:24.562 --> 01:26.695
That was just a casual question.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.349
JANE:
Actually...

01:28.392 --> 01:30.264
I thought it might be fun
to have a party this year.

01:30.307 --> 01:31.743
A party?

01:31.787 --> 01:34.094
Yeah; there's so much
to celebrate, you know?

01:34.137 --> 01:35.443
Raf and I
are moving in soon.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.184
I'm about to start
writing full-time.

01:37.227 --> 01:38.663
You filled up your punch card

01:38.707 --> 01:40.622
at the coffee shop this morning
and got a free latte.

01:40.665 --> 01:41.927
JANE:
You know?

01:41.971 --> 01:43.233
Life is good.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.801
I really think we need
to blow it up.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.980
Yes, exactly! Blow it up!

01:51.023 --> 01:53.417
Let's blow it out, let's blow
the roof off this joint!

01:53.461 --> 01:55.811
: Oh.RAFAEL: Wow.

01:55.854 --> 01:58.292
Okay. What about
two signature cocktails?

01:58.335 --> 02:00.729
"Jane-a-colada"
and "Jane and Tonic"?

02:02.600 --> 02:04.515
And two choices of cake?Yes, Matelio!

02:04.559 --> 02:07.388
And an ice sculpture
in the shape of Jane's head.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.346
I think it should be
a unicorn party.

02:09.390 --> 02:13.350
Yes, Matelio,
because Jane is like a unicorn.

02:13.394 --> 02:15.613
There's no one
else like her.

02:15.657 --> 02:18.138
And could we get a real unicorn?What?

02:18.181 --> 02:20.618
Can we, Mom? Please?

02:25.319 --> 02:26.929
You know, you
only turn 30 once.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.235
Let's get a
real unicorn.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.584
Yes!Yay.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.064
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
But alas...

02:32.108 --> 02:33.805
that was all before this:

02:35.459 --> 02:36.765
I need you to leave.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.375
MATEO:
I don't want to leave.

02:38.419 --> 02:39.811
I want to stay here with Daddy.

02:45.948 --> 02:48.168
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which led to this:

02:57.220 --> 02:58.569
What? Who's there?

02:58.613 --> 03:00.310
Oh, my God! No!
No, no, no, no.Jane.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.659
I didn't know
you were coming home.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.444
No, no, no--
Please don't get up!

03:09.101 --> 03:11.365
Rafael told me to leave.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.592
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Which brings us here, now.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.683
Rafael, I love you.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.033
I-I... I just need
to hear your voice.

03:28.077 --> 03:30.384
I... I don't know what to do.
Please, call me back.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.168
I love you.LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.735
She's been doing that
a lot lately.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.441
I don't want a party anymore.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.493
What am I celebrating?

03:52.536 --> 03:54.843
My relationship is in crisis,

03:54.886 --> 03:56.279
I got kicked out
of my apartment,

03:56.323 --> 03:57.628
my son hates me.

04:25.265 --> 04:29.138
Oh, my God.
Is that a gray hair?

04:43.065 --> 04:44.196
Where's my phone?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.810
No, I'm gonna call Marlene
and cancel that meeting.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.337
Uhp. I can't.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.817
I don't have pages to discuss,

04:55.860 --> 04:58.341
I haven't written a word
since Michael came back.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.782
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He couldn't have gone for oatmeal?

05:06.393 --> 05:07.611
Hmm.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.184
I don't know,
it was pretty awkward.

05:15.227 --> 05:16.359
I saw his...

05:28.806 --> 05:30.765
XIOMARA:
Mm... incredible.

05:30.808 --> 05:33.768
I can finally eat desert without
feeling instantly nauseous.

05:33.811 --> 05:36.597
And I definitely like
the banana the best.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.207
Then it should be yours.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.122
What do you mean?

05:40.165 --> 05:42.124
We're tasting cakes for Jane.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.605
Yes, but I've been thinking
you should have a cake as well.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.520
To celebrate being
done with chemo.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.652
You're out of
the woods now.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.438
The cake could be you...

05:51.481 --> 05:54.005
literally coming
out of the woods.

05:54.049 --> 05:55.659
I'm not out of the woods yet.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.531
Until after the PET scan.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.184
It's too early to celebrate.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.491
Let's just keep
the focus on Jane.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.712
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, saved by the...

06:04.755 --> 06:07.845
Baby!Who wants an adorable baby

06:07.889 --> 06:09.586
to breathe germs all over them?

06:09.630 --> 06:11.936
Me.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.199
The doctor said
my immune system

06:14.243 --> 06:15.984
can handle the exposure.

06:16.027 --> 06:18.595
Yes, he did.
Yes, he did.

06:18.639 --> 06:22.294
Are you ready to spend
quality time with Daddy?

06:28.823 --> 06:30.085
Ti-Ti-Tickle.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.349
Sorry.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.004
She's really clinging
to me these days.

06:37.919 --> 06:39.790
Just be...

06:42.097 --> 06:43.403
She's acting like
I'm a stranger.

06:45.274 --> 06:47.319
What did you do to her?

06:47.363 --> 06:49.974
Just loved her.

06:50.018 --> 06:51.498
Relax.

06:51.541 --> 06:54.239
Esteban's had more
face time lately.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.633
She'll warm up
after a couple nights with you.

06:56.677 --> 06:57.721
That's right.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.244
She will.

06:59.288 --> 07:02.552
She just needs
more face time with her daddy.

07:02.596 --> 07:05.076
Her real daddy.
Not daddy's stand-in.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.035
'Cause you're
my baby girl.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.864
My precious baby girl.

07:14.477 --> 07:17.088
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, dear.

07:17.132 --> 07:19.787
You know, let's check in
on Rogelio's other baby girl.

07:35.716 --> 07:37.587
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Geez,
maybe we should get Esteban

07:37.631 --> 07:38.893
to hold her.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.030
I'm sorry I haven't
answered your calls,

07:46.074 --> 07:48.250
but I need some time;
my life's a mess.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.295
Uh, that's not why I'm here.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.036
Uh, I just...JANE: Oh, my God,
Rafael's here.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.124
He can't see you.
Oh, God.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.605
Oh... Go, go.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.172
Hide.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.352
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Phew. That could've been bad.

08:03.395 --> 08:06.137
Hey, Mr. Sweetface.
What a nice surprise.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.967
So glad to see you.

08:10.011 --> 08:12.317
We're just here because Mateo
forgot his block castle

08:12.361 --> 08:13.710
for show and tell.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.625
Hurry up, buddy.
We're gonna be late.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.932
Uh, wait! Mateo, stop.

08:17.975 --> 08:19.977
Where's my hug?
I miss you.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.544
I'll get it.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.111
Oh, uh, no, don't.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.940
I, uh--
It-It's just a mess in there.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.289
That's fine.

08:54.621 --> 08:57.319
You're obviously busy.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.842
We're going.

08:58.886 --> 09:01.192
I need the dragon, too.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.846
RAFAEL:
Mateo, stop!Mateo!

09:05.675 --> 09:07.634
Why is he in my room?!

09:07.677 --> 09:10.506
Yeah, why is he?It-It's not what it looks like.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.334
Looks like Michael is
in our son's bedroom.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.162
I was just telling him to leave.That's true.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.164
Stay out of this!I hate you.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.557
This is all your fault!

09:18.775 --> 09:20.516
We're leaving.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.308
You have to go.Okay, but can I just tell you...

09:30.352 --> 09:31.440
Not right now.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.050
I have to talk
to Rafael and explain.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.269
I know you want answers
from me, but...

09:34.312 --> 09:35.575
It's not about that.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.054
What is it?

09:37.098 --> 09:39.970
My life insurance company
wants their money back.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.319
They found out I'm alive.

09:41.363 --> 09:42.799
They think I committed
insurance fraud.

09:42.843 --> 09:43.974
What?

09:44.018 --> 09:45.497
Yeah, I know.
It's ridiculous.

09:45.541 --> 09:46.803
But people fake deaths
for money,

09:46.847 --> 09:48.326
so we have to prove we didn't.

09:48.370 --> 09:49.806
We?

09:49.850 --> 09:51.939
Well, yeah.

09:51.982 --> 09:54.768
You're the beneficiary,
so you're liable, too.

09:56.857 --> 09:59.642
Anyway, the company wants
their 40 grand back.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.992
I don't have it.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.516
After you died, I had
to take some time off of work.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.388
I used the money
to support myself.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.004
MICHAEL:
I figured as much.

10:14.048 --> 10:16.311
Which is why we need
to provide documentation

10:16.354 --> 10:18.966
to prove that you really
believed I was dead.

10:19.009 --> 10:20.184
Can you help me with that?

10:20.228 --> 10:22.317
Yeah. Of course.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.492
But later, okay?

10:23.535 --> 10:25.494
My family's falling apart.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.017
PETRA :
Hurry up.

10:27.061 --> 10:30.368
You're going to be late
for your Mandarin lessons.

10:30.412 --> 10:33.502
Once the girls are gone, maybe
I can take this afternoon off

10:33.545 --> 10:35.373
so we can spend
some time together.

10:35.417 --> 10:38.855
And then, maybe
you can spend the night?

10:38.899 --> 10:41.510
I'm bartending until about 1:00.

10:41.553 --> 10:45.470
Don't make that face every time
I mention my job.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.951
I lost my license
to practice law. I have bills.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.649
I just feel bad.

10:49.692 --> 10:52.564
Don't. It is what it is.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.131
Come over after?

10:54.175 --> 10:57.700
Look, um,

10:57.744 --> 11:01.835
I'm actually not ready
to spend the night yet.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.663
Let's just take this slow.

11:03.706 --> 11:07.231
Yeah. Got it. No-no problem.

11:12.759 --> 11:16.458
Oh, hello, Temp.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.939
There's an emergency
at the brunch buffet.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.418
They ran out of shrimp.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.029
How did this happen?

11:22.072 --> 11:24.727
TEMP: The shellfish vendor
said Milos cancelled the order.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.947
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, good old Milos.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.259
He called and said

11:35.303 --> 11:36.696
no shellfish until you
talk to him again,

11:36.739 --> 11:39.699
and he asked that when
you speak to him that you...

11:39.742 --> 11:42.092
: "not be
crabby or shellfish".

11:42.136 --> 11:43.920
You think that's funny?
No.

11:43.964 --> 11:45.792
If you laugh,
you're fired.

11:45.835 --> 11:49.926
Go! Call the prison,
set up a phone call.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.624
I'm surprised you're
still in touch with Milos.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.148
Only because he owns the hotel.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.455
Trust me, he's the last person
I want to talk to.

11:57.499 --> 11:58.935
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And the last person

11:58.979 --> 12:00.632
Rafael wants to talk to?

12:00.676 --> 12:02.199
Thanks for
meeting me.

12:02.243 --> 12:03.766
I was gonna go
to your office

12:03.810 --> 12:05.333
and make another
big scene, but...

12:06.943 --> 12:08.466
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
I swear, that wasn't me.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.077
Those are actual crickets.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.906
I'm so sorry about everything
that happened this morning.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.516
I didn't invite
Michael over.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.779
He came because of a legal issue
with his life insurance.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.347
But then you and Mateo
showed up, and I panicked.

12:19.390 --> 12:21.218
I didn't want you to get
the wrong impression,

12:21.262 --> 12:22.742
which of course ended up
happening anyway.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.221
Yeah.

12:24.265 --> 12:28.443
I'm so sorry.
I love you.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.619
Yeah, but you love him, too.

12:30.662 --> 12:34.536
No. I mean, yes,

12:34.579 --> 12:36.277
because he was my husband,

12:36.320 --> 12:39.367
so a part of me still loves him,
but not the way I love you.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.282
And the point is that
I'm choosing you.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.849
I can get over those feelings.

12:42.892 --> 12:45.025
Get over them?That's not what I mean.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.854
Come on, I know you, Jane,
you're gonna have to explore it.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.117
That's not true.It is true.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.814
Otherwise, he wouldn't
still be here.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.947
And I don't want to wait around
while that happens

12:53.990 --> 12:55.992
'cause I'll just end up
in a bad place.

12:56.036 --> 12:57.341
So what are you saying?

13:00.431 --> 13:02.607
You need to move the rest
of your stuff out.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.697
That's it?

13:05.741 --> 13:08.396
We're just... over?

13:08.439 --> 13:10.877
I just can't do this again.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.053
Wait.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.145
I want to pick Mateo up
from school today.

13:18.188 --> 13:19.799
I need to smooth things
over with him.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.720
ROGELIO: Don't be sad,
my sweet, little daughter.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.593
You have a party
to go to tomorrow.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.856
Your big sister's
turning 30,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.859
but don't be jealous.

13:36.903 --> 13:40.167
When you turn 30,
you're gonna have...

13:41.821 --> 13:44.214
...a big party, too,
with lots of cake

13:44.258 --> 13:46.738
and ice cream
and balloons.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.964
Shh...

13:56.226 --> 13:57.445
Don't take it personally,

13:57.488 --> 13:59.273
he just has a way with babies.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.449
You really have
a talent, Smush.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.885
Yes, well,

14:02.929 --> 14:04.626
we all have talents.

14:04.669 --> 14:07.585
Mine happens to be acting
and executive producing.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.588
I just watched a cut of The
Passions of Steve and Brenda

14:10.632 --> 14:13.330
and it's phenomenal.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.900
Come here, sweet Baby.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.207
Oh, oh, it's okay.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.035
You're okay.

14:24.646 --> 14:27.301
Oh, boy. Baby needs
a diaper change.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.346
I got it, Mush.

14:32.654 --> 14:35.352
Could you please stop gloating
about your career to Esteban?

14:35.396 --> 14:37.528
Could he please stop
gloating about the fact

14:37.572 --> 14:39.704
that he's so good
with Baby?

14:39.748 --> 14:41.315
He wasn't, I was.

14:41.358 --> 14:44.405
Because his whole life
is looking after Baby right now.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.276
Sebastian el Gigantetanked,

14:46.320 --> 14:49.627
and he's been struggling
to get his next role.

14:49.671 --> 14:53.718
Oh. I didn't know that.Yeah.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.416
So cut him a break, okay?

14:55.459 --> 14:57.679
Of course.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.125
Barry, I need a favor.

15:09.169 --> 15:10.474
MARLENE:
No way.

15:10.518 --> 15:11.954
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, Marlene.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.435
I know I asked you
to catch me up on your life,

15:14.478 --> 15:16.480
but I was not expecting
all of that.

15:16.524 --> 15:17.960
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Jane's former teacher,

15:18.004 --> 15:20.093
current mentor,
and future golf partner.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.138
Well, once. Jane shoots a 200,

15:22.182 --> 15:24.097
nails an old lady
in the back of the head,

15:24.140 --> 15:25.663
and gets asked
to never come back.

15:25.707 --> 15:28.797
Yeah, so that's why I haven't
gotten much writing done.

15:28.840 --> 15:34.324
Wow. I am so sorry for you.
That is... wow.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.978
You don't look that sorry.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.111
No, no, no,
I am, truly.

15:38.154 --> 15:42.115
This is... this is just
such great material.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.987
The love, the heartbreak,
the conflict.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.511
Well, it doesn't feel like great
material when you're living it.

15:47.555 --> 15:48.948
It feels horrible.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.340
A-At least when
Michael had amnesia,

15:50.384 --> 15:51.863
I wasn't breaking up
my entire family...

15:51.907 --> 15:52.995
That! That sentence.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.692
You have to
write that down.

15:54.736 --> 15:58.870
I know, I'm sorry,
it's a terrible situation,

15:58.914 --> 16:00.307
but write it.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.178
I can't write.
I'm too emotional.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.571
Well, at least
take notes,

16:03.614 --> 16:06.052
so you can remember
all the details later.

16:06.095 --> 16:07.705
I don't think I can handle
taking notes

16:07.749 --> 16:09.707
on some of the most painful
moments of my life.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.622
Just pretend you're an observer.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.363
Write in a dispassionate
narrative voice.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.712
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Hey!

16:14.756 --> 16:16.366
Narrators are not
dispassionate.

16:16.410 --> 16:17.889
We have a clear point of view.

16:17.933 --> 16:20.109
Detached. Objective.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.198
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Would you
rather have Siri narrate this?

16:22.242 --> 16:25.549
Okay. I'll give dispassionate
narrator a try.

16:25.593 --> 16:27.377
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Fine, so will I.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.206
: Here is Jane,
taking Marlene's advice

16:30.250 --> 16:32.382
while waiting to pick
her son up from school.

16:32.426 --> 16:35.907
Oh, look.
Mateo dislikes his mother.

16:35.951 --> 16:38.388
See? Boring!

16:38.432 --> 16:40.912
Come on, sweetie,
let's go.

16:40.956 --> 16:44.612
Hey, I know you're
mad at me, but-- Wait!

16:44.655 --> 16:47.267
Mateo, don't you
run away from me!

16:47.310 --> 16:49.704
Hey!

16:51.880 --> 16:53.751
You know
better than

16:53.795 --> 16:55.231
crossing the street
without holding my hand!

16:55.275 --> 16:57.973
I'm not going with you!
Do not touch my body!

16:58.017 --> 16:59.018
WOMAN:
Is something wrong?

16:59.061 --> 17:00.932
Oh, he's, uh...
I'm his mother.

17:00.976 --> 17:03.022
No, she's not!
Stranger danger!

17:03.065 --> 17:04.893
Are you really
this boy's mother?

17:04.936 --> 17:06.764
Yes, I am.
No, you're not!

17:06.808 --> 17:08.679
Here, I'll show you.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.160
Here's one of us together.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.596
That doesn't look
like him at all.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.425
No, it's j-just a weird angle.
Hang on. Stop it.

17:17.514 --> 17:18.994
Okay, Mateo,

17:19.038 --> 17:21.431
it's time to go now.

17:21.475 --> 17:25.305
What are...?

17:25.348 --> 17:27.524
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

17:27.568 --> 17:28.569
I hate you!
I hate you!

17:28.612 --> 17:30.092
I hate you! I hate you!

17:30.136 --> 17:32.094
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Write it down, Jane.

17:32.138 --> 17:34.096
Write it down!

17:46.674 --> 17:47.718
NARRATOR: You'll recall,
we last left Jane...

17:47.762 --> 17:49.894
I don't want to hear
another word!

17:49.938 --> 17:51.418
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Geez, okay.

17:51.461 --> 17:52.462
Go to your room, Mateo.

17:52.506 --> 17:54.943
What's going on?He ran away from me.

17:54.986 --> 17:56.727
Across the street, with no adult
holding his hand,

17:56.771 --> 17:58.381
and then he pretended
like he didn't know me.

17:58.425 --> 18:02.907
Well, he's had
a rough couple of days.

18:05.040 --> 18:08.652
Yes, he has, but even so,
he can't run into the street.

18:08.696 --> 18:13.483
I just think we can give him
a pass, given the circumstances.

18:13.527 --> 18:15.833
A pass?
He's upset.

18:15.877 --> 18:19.315
And he won't do it again.
Right, buddy?

18:20.925 --> 18:22.840
XIOMARA:
So he totally undermined you?

18:22.884 --> 18:24.712
Yes, in front
of Mateo.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.627
I know he's upset,
but we have to co-parent!

18:26.670 --> 18:29.543
Don't yell at me.I'm not, I'm yelling at Rafael!

18:29.586 --> 18:31.458
I agree. When it comes
to co-parenting,

18:31.501 --> 18:32.720
you must do whatever it takes,

18:32.763 --> 18:35.201
even get someone
a job in Mexico.

18:37.203 --> 18:38.552
I'm not following, Dad.

18:38.595 --> 18:41.555
I had a small co-parenting
issue of my own,

18:41.598 --> 18:45.820
which I solved by sending
"the issue" away.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.648
You got Esteban
a job in Mexico?

18:47.691 --> 18:49.215
How is that good co-parenting?

18:49.258 --> 18:51.739
It's a lead role. Barry had
to pull a lot of strings.

18:51.782 --> 18:54.350
And while Esteban's gone,
Baby will bond with me.

18:54.394 --> 18:55.569
That is not good co-parenting!

18:55.612 --> 18:56.744
That is you thinking
of yourself!

18:56.787 --> 18:57.919
What is wrong with you?

18:57.962 --> 19:00.182
Are you really yelling
at Rafael again?

19:00.226 --> 19:02.706
No, Dad, I'm yelling at you!

19:02.750 --> 19:05.013
PETRA: I don't get it,
why are you angry?

19:05.056 --> 19:07.363
Because I went to get my phone
and picked up yours

19:07.407 --> 19:08.930
and saw this e-mail to Milos.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.367
I didn't e-mail Milos.Unbelievable.

19:11.411 --> 19:12.803
It's right here, Petra,

19:12.847 --> 19:14.457
how you said you won't
testify against him

19:14.501 --> 19:16.024
if he gives you the hotel.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.982
What are you
talking about?

19:18.026 --> 19:19.201
I didn't write this.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.116
It's from your account.Yes, I know,

19:21.160 --> 19:23.727
but I'm being set up.
You have to believe me.

19:23.771 --> 19:26.687
Really? The last time
we went down this road,

19:26.730 --> 19:28.732
you let me believe that
you were innocent for months.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.691
And you honestly think
I'd lie to you again?

19:31.692 --> 19:33.911
I swear this wasn't me.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.566
I'll-I'll prove it to you.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.395
JANE: Okay.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.615
Lots of proof.

19:41.658 --> 19:44.531
Oh, it's for my
birthday party.

19:44.574 --> 19:48.448
Yeah. Big one coming up,
if I remember correctly.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.930
Don't worry. I'm not gonna crash
your 30th birthday party.

19:52.974 --> 19:56.412
I found a bunch of receipts, uh,
from your funeral arrangements.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.066
You can send that to the
insurance company, right?

19:58.109 --> 19:59.285
Yes, that's great.

19:59.328 --> 20:02.940
Wow, you went really big
on the flowers.

20:02.984 --> 20:06.379
Oh, yeah. Spared no expense.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.080
Uh, plus medical files

20:12.123 --> 20:13.690
and witness testimonies
from the LSATs.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.388
That's got to be enough.

20:15.431 --> 20:18.129
If not, I can always
take out a loan.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.610
I could split it.
Cut corners. No vacations.

20:20.654 --> 20:21.742
Have you been taking vacations?

20:21.785 --> 20:23.483
No vacations ever.

20:23.526 --> 20:26.094
But I do aspire to be a person
who takes vacations.

20:28.531 --> 20:31.578
We were pretty good
at planning stay-cations,

20:31.621 --> 20:34.233
as I remember.

20:37.018 --> 20:42.153
Um, so we didn't get to go to
Puerto Rico for our honeymoon,

20:42.197 --> 20:46.245
so this is... well, it's not
that, but something else.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.464
Michael.

20:48.508 --> 20:50.510
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.644
What to do
in such a passionate moment?

20:57.560 --> 21:00.998
We actually might need
that document for the case.

21:01.042 --> 21:04.306
Hmm? You write a dispassionate note.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.918
Okay, that one doesn't
look dispassionate.

21:10.704 --> 21:13.837
I see you, Rogelio.
What do you want?

21:13.881 --> 21:15.839
You have excellent
peripheral vision.

21:15.883 --> 21:21.149
I just came by to bring Baby
this adorable lavender tutu.

21:21.192 --> 21:24.500
And see if I could get some more
impromptu face time with her

21:24.544 --> 21:25.762
before the party.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.199
She's sleeping in the nursery.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.853
You can wait here
until she's up.

21:31.507 --> 21:34.467
I notice you have
your rage face on.

21:34.510 --> 21:35.990
What are you doing?

21:36.033 --> 21:40.168
Filling out a Darci Factor
breakup workbook.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.344
I feel calmer
already.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.172
Wait. Breakup?

21:44.215 --> 21:46.783
Esteban took a job shooting
a telenovela in Mexico,

21:46.827 --> 21:48.350
and he broke up with me.

21:54.704 --> 21:57.228
Darci. Look...Be quiet. I'm fine.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.621
No. Listen, this
is all my fault.

21:58.665 --> 22:01.232
I was jealous of
Baby's attachment

22:01.276 --> 22:05.367
to Esteban, and...
I got him that job.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.413
No kidding.

22:07.456 --> 22:08.892
We realized that, you jackass.

22:08.936 --> 22:12.243
And it was
a really dumb thing to do.

22:12.287 --> 22:14.071
But the fact that
he broke up with me

22:14.115 --> 22:16.117
to do this show, well...

22:16.160 --> 22:20.382
well, you exposed some real
problems in my relationship.

22:20.426 --> 22:23.907
Darci Factor rule #83.

22:23.951 --> 22:27.476
"Use the fight
to shine a light."

22:27.520 --> 22:29.478
Better I know now than later.

22:29.522 --> 22:31.741
I'm so sorry this happened.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.309
Well, if you really feel bad,
you can meet Esteban

22:34.353 --> 22:36.311
and pick up
some of Baby's stuff.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.313
I can't see his face right now.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.663
Darci Factor rule #13.

22:40.707 --> 22:44.450
"When it ends,
don't be friends."

22:44.493 --> 22:46.365
Are you okay?

22:46.408 --> 22:49.368
No.

22:49.411 --> 22:52.283
But I will be.

22:52.327 --> 22:55.678
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Okay. Let's get out
of this sad place,

22:55.722 --> 22:57.680
and head over
to our birthday girl.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.204
Okay, just as miserable. Noted.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.470
Yeah, yeah, I'm hurrying.

23:08.996 --> 23:10.867
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I didn't want to say it, but...

23:10.911 --> 23:12.521
I'm just not in the party mood.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.614
It's Rafael.

23:18.658 --> 23:20.137
Hello?

23:20.181 --> 23:21.661
Hi, it's me, Mateo.

23:21.704 --> 23:24.664
Oh, hey, Mateo.
I can't wait to see you tonight.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.666
The unicorn can't wait, either.
He told me.

23:26.709 --> 23:29.625
I'm not coming.
And unicorns don't talk.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.279
What do you mean
you're not coming?

23:31.322 --> 23:32.759
I'm sick.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.761
Are you really sick,

23:34.804 --> 23:36.415
or are you just mad
because my...

23:39.461 --> 23:41.463
He hung up.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.944
Hi, you've reached
Rafael Solano,

23:43.987 --> 23:47.426
please leave...Voice mail. I'm done. Mm-mm.

23:49.123 --> 23:52.692
My son is not missing
my unicorn birthday party.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.087
What are you doing here?

23:57.131 --> 23:59.525
Look, I know you're unhappy with
me, but we are co-parents first.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.178
We have to be on the same team.

24:01.222 --> 24:02.745
Do you think that
I want to have a party today?

24:02.789 --> 24:05.835
No. But I'm having one
and my son needs to be there.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.882
And no matter how you feel about
me, you have to support that.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.798
He says he doesn't feel well.

24:11.841 --> 24:14.017
And he's clearly faking it
because he's mad at me.

24:14.061 --> 24:16.019
And you're letting him
get away with that.

24:16.063 --> 24:18.892
And letting your feelings get in
the way is not good parenting.

24:20.415 --> 24:21.547
Come on, Mateo. Let's go.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.641
Oh...

24:28.684 --> 24:31.426
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Impressive
commitment to faking it.Oh, sweetie.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.515
Here, Mommy will stay, too.
Let me take care of you.

24:33.559 --> 24:34.951
No. Go away.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.695
It's okay. I got this.

24:39.739 --> 24:40.914
You can go.

25:01.587 --> 25:04.415
You know, it's okay to
want Mommy right now.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.809
No. I'm mad
until you're not mad.

25:06.853 --> 25:10.421
No. No, we are separate people.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.946
And no matter what happens
with me and Mommy,

25:12.989 --> 25:14.556
your mommy loves you.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.253
Do you still love her?

25:16.297 --> 25:18.255
Always.

25:18.299 --> 25:22.216
We're just figuring out
the way we love each other.

25:26.481 --> 25:29.397
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
True, for the record.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.755
PETRA:
Please don't cry.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.148
Then stop yelling at me.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.672
I'm not yelling at you,
I'm-- you're just here,

25:43.716 --> 25:45.892
and I'm angry, okay?No...?

25:45.935 --> 25:47.807
Shh. Did you find
the security footage

25:47.850 --> 25:49.243
from the time
the e-mail was sent?

25:49.286 --> 25:50.549
Yes. You were right.

25:50.592 --> 25:51.985
You were firing
Travis the busboy.

25:52.028 --> 25:54.030
Yes. I knew it.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.512
W-Wait. Where am I?

25:58.557 --> 26:00.297
Oh.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.735
T-That's okay. Travis can
vouch for me, say I was there.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.998
I don't think Travis
will want to help you
since you just fired him.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.869
Shh. No one asked you, Temp.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.305
Jane!

26:08.349 --> 26:11.482
Look, right there.

26:11.526 --> 26:15.574
You know, I should get
to her party a little early.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.401
Gift-wrap this.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.969
ROGELIO: Hey, I'm gonna be
a few minutes late.

26:20.013 --> 26:22.319
Esteban isn't here yet.
How does the house look?

26:22.363 --> 26:24.626
It's the unicorn party
of your dreams.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.454
Okay, good.

26:26.497 --> 26:28.630
Oh, make sure Jane's head
is away from the door

26:28.674 --> 26:31.764
so it doesn't melt.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.635
Got it.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.812
Oh, thank God. It's him.
Okay, see you soon.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.032
And don't worry, I look amazing.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.645
Hello, thank you
for stopping by.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.516
I'll just take that
so we can both be on our way.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.649
Hold on.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.303
I want to show you
exactly where everything is

26:49.346 --> 26:52.175
so Baby always has
what she needs.

26:52.219 --> 26:56.440
I put her favorite paci
in the front pocket

26:56.484 --> 26:59.182
and her second favorite paci
in the back pocket.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.750
Great. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Bye.

27:01.794 --> 27:02.969
Wait.

27:05.580 --> 27:08.104
I also brought another bag,
with some of Darci's things.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.672
Could you give it to her?

27:10.716 --> 27:12.369
Yes, of course.

27:15.242 --> 27:18.462
What are you doing?

27:18.506 --> 27:20.290
I'm crying, man.

27:20.334 --> 27:23.859
I love Darci, and my heart has
broken into a million pieces

27:23.903 --> 27:26.557
that my body
can no longer contain.

27:26.601 --> 27:28.559
Then why did you
break up with her?

27:28.603 --> 27:31.127
Because it was the right thing
to do, for the family.

27:31.171 --> 27:33.695
W-What is that supposed to mean?

27:33.739 --> 27:36.393
I came from a messed up family.

27:36.437 --> 27:40.093
My father and my mother's
three lovers hated each other,

27:40.136 --> 27:42.965
and the constant fighting
really messed me up.

27:43.009 --> 27:45.881
So when I found out
the lengths you went through

27:45.925 --> 27:49.058
to get me out of Baby's life,
I realized

27:49.102 --> 27:52.061
that I could not put Baby
through that.

27:52.105 --> 27:55.499
Because I know
how Baby would feel.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.588
Because...

27:57.632 --> 27:59.982
I am Baby.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.769
Anyway,

28:03.812 --> 28:06.293
let me get her car seat.

28:09.383 --> 28:11.907
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ugh, parenting.

28:11.951 --> 28:14.083
It's hard sometimes.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.129
But hey, come on, Jane.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.653
The party. Focus on the party.

28:26.226 --> 28:28.707
Maybe she just went to get ice?

28:33.189 --> 28:34.408
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Ah, yes. You'll recall

28:34.451 --> 28:35.801
we last left our Jane

28:35.844 --> 28:39.065
fleeing her own unicorn party.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.370
This is bad, people.

28:40.414 --> 28:42.372
Where is she going?

28:45.245 --> 28:46.594
I'm coming with you.

28:46.637 --> 28:47.726
You are?

28:47.769 --> 28:49.249
Yes, of course.
I care about Jane, too.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.555
And she needs her
to corroborate an alibi.

28:51.599 --> 28:55.472
Someone get that little donkey
with a horn out of my house.

28:55.516 --> 28:56.909
I don't care
how magical it may be,

28:56.952 --> 28:58.606
I am not dealing
with unicorn poop.

28:58.649 --> 29:00.434
How will we find her?XIOMARA:
Easy.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.218
We're a Find My Friends
kind of family.

29:02.262 --> 29:04.786
Okay. Where'd you go, Jane?

29:04.830 --> 29:06.005
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Found her.

29:06.048 --> 29:07.484
XIOMARA:
Jane!

29:07.528 --> 29:08.964
What are you doing here?

29:09.008 --> 29:11.184
What are you doing here?I wanted to be alone.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.667
Yes, I can. I'm a grown woman
and I can run away if I want to.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.408
Oh, no! My notes!

29:28.331 --> 29:30.507
No!DARCI: Oh, no.

29:30.551 --> 29:31.944
What is he doing here?

29:31.987 --> 29:34.207
Esteban still loves you, Darci.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.731
He only broke up with you
to protect Baby from us.

29:36.775 --> 29:37.950
ESTEBAN:
You know how I grew up.

29:37.993 --> 29:39.821
With my father and my mother,

29:39.865 --> 29:42.998
and Diego and Matias and
Alejandro always fighting.

29:43.042 --> 29:45.566
I can't put Baby through that.

29:47.220 --> 29:49.831
Well, that's a better reason,
at least.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.398
I thought you wanted
to sleep with some

29:51.441 --> 29:53.530
sexy telenovela bombshell.

29:53.574 --> 29:57.752
You are the only sexy telenovela
bombshell for me, Darci.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.189
Aww. See?

30:00.233 --> 30:03.410
Great, so now you can make up.

30:03.453 --> 30:06.456
No. It's still over.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.374
Wait, wait.Why?

30:11.418 --> 30:14.029
Because what happens the next
time he does something stupid?

30:14.073 --> 30:15.683
He won't. Will you?

30:15.726 --> 30:17.511
I won't.
You will.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.208
And I'm stuck
with this doofus, Esteban.

30:19.252 --> 30:22.081
Okay, that's true, you are.
But I can do better.

30:22.124 --> 30:24.213
I want to do better,
because it's best for Baby

30:24.257 --> 30:26.215
to be surrounded by people
who love each other.

30:26.259 --> 30:28.391
And you two
love each other.

30:28.435 --> 30:31.394
Please, Darci.
Take Esteban back.

30:31.438 --> 30:34.484
Please, Darci. Take me back.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.533
Fine.

30:39.576 --> 30:42.884
But if this
ever happens again...

30:45.626 --> 30:47.628
Oh.

30:51.284 --> 30:56.245
How about a champagne toast
and a foot rub

30:56.289 --> 30:59.945
to celebrate the end of this
dark time of separation?

30:59.988 --> 31:02.948
You don't have to do that.
It was only one day.

31:02.991 --> 31:05.646
Hmm. Darci Factor
rule #355.

31:05.689 --> 31:07.909
"Want to keep your mate?

31:07.953 --> 31:10.912
Then take every chance
to celebrate."

31:10.956 --> 31:13.828
That's really good advice.

31:15.656 --> 31:17.397
Now, I should find Jane.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.920
Oh, she's not here.

31:18.964 --> 31:20.704
What? Where is she?

31:20.748 --> 31:23.055
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Oh, look. Found her again.

31:23.098 --> 31:25.187
I'm sorry, hon.

31:25.231 --> 31:27.189
Oh, it's okay.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.626
Celebrating my 30th birthday
while sitting in a ditch

31:29.670 --> 31:31.672
feels pretty right, honestly.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.725
PETRA: What happened?

31:41.769 --> 31:45.251
Just seeing everyone
waiting there,

31:45.294 --> 31:49.081
and, uh, having to walk in
without Rafael,

31:49.124 --> 31:51.953
I couldn't do it.

31:51.997 --> 31:55.652
Because then, it would be all
so real that this is happening.

31:57.654 --> 32:00.048
I know it's just a stupid
birthday party, but celebrating

32:00.092 --> 32:02.050
without Rafael feels
like I'm accepting

32:02.094 --> 32:04.966
that I'm moving forward
without him.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.406
XIOMARA:
Yeah, we're here for you.

32:10.450 --> 32:12.843
As long as it takes.PETRA:
Absolutely.

32:12.887 --> 32:15.237
Hey, don't worry. Rafael will
realize he's making a mistake.

32:15.281 --> 32:17.239
Want me to call him
and yell at him?

32:17.283 --> 32:19.981
No, don't. I'll figure it out.

32:20.025 --> 32:23.593
Aww, there's that smile.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.465
Can I just grab that napkin?Hmm?

32:25.508 --> 32:27.336
Well, the one you're holding. Do
you mind-- can I just have it?

32:27.380 --> 32:29.121
Thank you. Yes! Great.

32:29.164 --> 32:31.775
"Jane can't pick up her check
until Petra is done viciously

32:31.819 --> 32:33.516
"firing Travis, but Jane
doesn't even feel bad for him

32:33.560 --> 32:35.779
"because all she can think about
is how lucky he is that his kids

32:35.823 --> 32:37.694
are still speaking
to him." Yay!

32:37.738 --> 32:39.958
This plus the video is the proof
I need to save my relationship.

32:40.001 --> 32:42.090
Okay, I'm off. Oh, hey.

32:42.134 --> 32:43.831
You got this, girl.
Okay? Happy birthday.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.708
Oh, it was Marlene's idea.

32:51.752 --> 32:54.146
She told me to write
dispassionate observations

32:54.189 --> 32:56.278
about my life instead
of trying to write.

32:56.322 --> 32:57.714
Hmm.

32:57.758 --> 33:00.804
"Michael still
mispronounces 'deficit.'

33:00.848 --> 33:03.459
"And even though he talks
slower, his eyes still

33:03.503 --> 33:06.288
look the same before he's
about to make a joke."

33:06.332 --> 33:09.988
"He's slower to laugh

33:10.031 --> 33:13.295
"than he used to be,
but when he does,

33:13.339 --> 33:15.384
it's still contagious."

33:15.428 --> 33:18.387
"As Jane sat there with
Michael across the table,

33:18.431 --> 33:21.912
"the urge to take his hand
was so strong that suddenly,

33:21.956 --> 33:24.915
"Jane felt like she was
back in their old apartment,

33:24.959 --> 33:26.569
"living their old life.

33:26.613 --> 33:29.572
And if she was being honest,
she liked that feeling."

33:29.616 --> 33:34.621
Hon, these don't seem
very dispassionate.

33:34.664 --> 33:36.231
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Told you.

33:36.275 --> 33:38.407
Narrators always have
a point of view.

33:38.451 --> 33:43.064
It seems like there are
feelings there, for Michael.

33:43.108 --> 33:46.763
And if there are,

33:46.807 --> 33:50.202
why are you trying so hard
to get Rafael back?

33:57.426 --> 33:59.776
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Friends,
exactly four weeks ago,

33:59.820 --> 34:02.431
Rafael's girlfriend was four
weeks away from turning 30.

34:02.475 --> 34:04.955
Let's get a real unicorn!

34:04.999 --> 34:07.219
There goes my gift.

34:07.262 --> 34:08.872
Ha.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.179
But really. What do you want?

34:11.223 --> 34:12.963
Nothing. We're saving money.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.182
Still.

34:14.226 --> 34:17.403
A card telling me
how much you love me.

34:20.145 --> 34:23.670
Which, for the record,
he wrote that very night.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.803
Very not dispassionately.

34:26.847 --> 34:29.502
But alas, that was before...

34:29.545 --> 34:31.547
Michael got his memories back.

34:31.591 --> 34:33.506
Which led to this...

34:33.549 --> 34:35.073
I need you to leave.

34:35.116 --> 34:37.597
Leaving him here,
at this moment,

34:37.640 --> 34:39.425
four weeks later.

34:39.468 --> 34:43.255
RAFAEL: "A card, telling you
how much I love you.

34:43.298 --> 34:45.126
"That's what you said.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.867
"Which feels impossible, Jane,

34:46.910 --> 34:50.000
"because I love you with
everything that I am.

34:50.044 --> 34:54.092
But I guess this sums it up:
will you marry me?"

35:01.882 --> 35:03.449
Thanks for coming.

35:03.492 --> 35:06.713
Thanks for asking me to.

35:06.756 --> 35:09.237
Uh, you were right.

35:09.281 --> 35:10.934
I wasn't being
a good parent.

35:10.978 --> 35:15.591
I should have supported
you, and I'm sorry.

35:15.635 --> 35:17.419
And also...We should talk about-- oh.

35:17.463 --> 35:19.465
Uh, go ahead. You.

35:19.508 --> 35:22.250
I was just about to say
you were right.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.731
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And friends,
it feels cruel to point out

35:24.774 --> 35:27.299
that his heart
had opened, briefly.

35:27.342 --> 35:30.258
I can't just dismiss
how I feel about Michael.

35:30.302 --> 35:34.567
But alas, that's my job.

35:34.610 --> 35:38.266
I've been running away from my
feelings because I'm confused,

35:38.310 --> 35:41.661
but it's-it's not fair

35:41.704 --> 35:44.272
for me to ask you to stick
around while I sort through it.

35:47.667 --> 35:51.627
Yeah. Yeah,
that's what I thought.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.803
What's she doing here?

35:55.501 --> 35:57.590
You're spending the
night at Mommy's place

35:57.633 --> 35:59.592
like we talked about.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.116
But...
Get your stuff.
It's not up for debate.

36:03.726 --> 36:05.815
J.R.:
He looks devastated.

36:05.859 --> 36:07.600
What did you say to him?

36:07.643 --> 36:09.602
T-That's not the point.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.604
The-the point is,
I was firing the busboy

36:11.647 --> 36:14.215
and Jane was writing about it
at exactly the same time

36:14.259 --> 36:15.608
the e-mail was sent to Milos.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.218
So it couldn't
have been me.

36:17.262 --> 36:20.395
Someone was setting me up.
Milos, probably.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.832
Yeah, okay.

36:22.876 --> 36:25.139
I believe you.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.880
Look-- but wait.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.273
Running around
that ditch,

36:28.316 --> 36:30.884
trying to find
a piece of paper--

36:30.927 --> 36:32.712
I can't do that.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.453
If we're going
to do this--

36:34.496 --> 36:38.544
us-- I need you to trust me.

36:38.587 --> 36:42.200
How am I supposed to?
After what happened?

36:42.243 --> 36:45.464
How can we be in a relationship
if you can't?

36:46.987 --> 36:49.207
Look, I get
taking things slow.

36:49.250 --> 36:50.382
That's fine.

36:50.425 --> 36:53.602
But you have
to believe, deep down,

36:53.646 --> 36:55.604
that I would never
lie to you again.

36:55.648 --> 36:58.825
And I don't know, deep down,
that I do believe that.

36:58.868 --> 37:01.610
It's hard.

37:01.654 --> 37:05.048
You lied for a long time.
And I work at a bar now.

37:05.092 --> 37:07.355
You said you didn't
blame me for that.I don't.

37:07.399 --> 37:10.228
But it's a constant
reminder, and...

37:10.271 --> 37:11.838
well, the truth is,

37:11.881 --> 37:14.536
it's hard to feel safe with you.

37:18.584 --> 37:21.369
Okay.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.328
Okay?

37:23.371 --> 37:25.721
I'll have to work harder, then.

37:25.765 --> 37:28.028
To make you feel safe.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.380
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Also working hard...

37:32.424 --> 37:34.426
Do you want me to read
you a bedtime story?No.

37:37.559 --> 37:40.083
Do you want a kiss?

37:40.127 --> 37:42.738
And maybe it was
Mateo's constant rejection

37:42.782 --> 37:45.567
or the return of Jane's
complicated love triangle

37:45.611 --> 37:48.309
or the fact that she spent
her 30th birthday in a ditch,

37:48.353 --> 37:50.180
but in that moment,

37:50.224 --> 37:53.053
Jane couldn't run away
from her feelings.

37:55.142 --> 37:56.926
Mommy, are you crying?

37:56.970 --> 37:59.886
No, I'm fine. I promise.

37:59.929 --> 38:03.759
Oh. It's okay, Mommy's
just going through a lot,

38:03.803 --> 38:05.761
but it has nothing
to do with you, okay?

38:05.805 --> 38:07.850
I'm sorry I ran away.

38:07.894 --> 38:11.114
Yeah, that wasn't okay.

38:11.158 --> 38:13.465
Oh...

38:13.508 --> 38:16.337
But honestly?

38:16.381 --> 38:18.600
I understand
why you did it.

38:18.644 --> 38:22.604
Because today, I ran away
from my own birthday party.

38:22.648 --> 38:23.866
You did?

38:23.910 --> 38:25.607
I didn't even go inside.

38:25.651 --> 38:28.349
I-I just drove up, I saw all
the people and then I ran away.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.872
Then what happened?

38:29.916 --> 38:34.790
Well, I actually
ended up in a ditch.

38:36.226 --> 38:39.317
And then Abuela and Bisa
and Auntie Petra,

38:39.360 --> 38:41.971
they showed up..XIOMARA:
I hope Jane's feeling better.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.712
She's a strong,
capable 30-year-old

38:43.756 --> 38:45.148
with impeccable genes.

38:45.192 --> 38:46.802
She'll be fine.

38:46.846 --> 38:49.152
Even if she doesn't feel
like celebrating right now.

38:49.196 --> 38:52.634
And speaking of celebrating...

38:56.725 --> 39:01.164
It's a Rocovery basket, for you.

39:01.208 --> 39:03.645
It is filled
with everything

39:03.689 --> 39:05.343
you've been deprived
of during chemo

39:05.386 --> 39:08.258
to celebrate that you're
on the path to recovery.

39:08.302 --> 39:10.173
Rogelio, I told you,
I don't want...

39:10.217 --> 39:12.480
I-I know, I-I know,
we can't celebrate

39:12.524 --> 39:14.352
the ultimate victory yet.

39:14.395 --> 39:18.268
But we can celebrate
smaller victories along the way.

39:18.312 --> 39:20.662
Thank you, Rogelio.

39:20.706 --> 39:21.837
Of course.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.665
Not just for the basket,

39:23.709 --> 39:27.452
but for being my rock
through all of this.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.545
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And from one happy couple

39:33.588 --> 39:36.199
to, well, Jane and Michael.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.897
So I submitted the evidence,

39:37.940 --> 39:40.943
and the company agreed
to settle for $10,000,

39:40.987 --> 39:42.902
which I can pay
in installments,

39:42.945 --> 39:44.991
so we're all good.I can help.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.514
No. I'll take care of it.

39:46.558 --> 39:50.257
I also wanted to bring you
your belated birthday gift.

39:55.088 --> 39:57.090
Thanks, but I already own,
like, 400 copies.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.613
Well, this one's different,
'cause I really wanted

39:58.657 --> 40:00.049
to talk to you
while I was reading it,

40:00.093 --> 40:03.357
so I wrote down
my reactions instead.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.750
And I noted a few places
where I thought

40:04.793 --> 40:07.405
Martin could have been
a little funnier.

40:10.103 --> 40:12.148
Happy birthday, Jane.

40:13.715 --> 40:16.152
Or Josephine.

40:47.749 --> 40:50.665
Oh. Oh...

41:05.071 --> 41:06.507
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
And so, friends,

41:06.551 --> 41:08.944
without knowing
where she was going,

41:08.988 --> 41:11.599
Jane began to write again.

41:17.866 --> 41:19.607
UNICORN: Happy
birthday, Jane.

41:19.651 --> 41:22.044
From one unicorn to another.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.946
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
Uh-oh.

41:53.989 --> 41:57.340
Looks like Rafael may be
the one running away.
