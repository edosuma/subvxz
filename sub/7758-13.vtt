SO...

01:19.513 --> 01:22.616
HOW DO WE MAKE THIS
FUCKING UGLY SHOE EXCITING?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.352
- THE SAME WAY WE MADE
THOSE FUCKING UGLY RAINCOATS

01:24.385 --> 01:25.353
EXCITING LAST MAY.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.121

01:27.155 --> 01:31.325
BY TAKING YOUR EYE
OFF THIS SHOE...

01:31.359 --> 01:34.462
- AND PUTTING IT ON THIS FACE.

01:37.531 --> 01:42.170
- YEAH, BUT THE TROUBLE IS THAT
WE'RE NOT SELLING THIS FACE.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.639
WE'RE SELLING

THE SHOE

02:07.861 --> 02:11.332
WITH MAYBE
A THOUGHT BUBBLE

02:11.365 --> 02:13.934
SAYING SOMETHING LIKE,

02:13.967 --> 02:17.137
"I'M NOT HIP.
I'M A CLASSIC."

02:19.673 --> 02:21.475
- BRIAN, MAY WE CONTINUE,
PLEASE?

02:21.509 --> 02:24.245
- NO, YOU MAY NOT.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.480
"I'M NOT HIP.
I'M A CLASSIC."

02:26.514 --> 02:30.584
YOU'VE GIVEN IT
PERSONALITY WITH HUMOR

02:30.618 --> 02:34.422
AND RETAINED
ITS SO-CALLED DIGNITY.

02:34.455 --> 02:35.489

02:37.691 --> 02:40.661

02:58.879 --> 03:01.649
- YOU KNOW, I JUST HAVE TO SAY
THAT A YEAR AGO

03:01.682 --> 03:03.484
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US
WOULD HAVE DREAMED

03:03.517 --> 03:05.686
THAT WE'D BE SITTING HERE
PREGNANT.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.656
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY HAPPENED.
[woman laughs]

03:08.689 --> 03:12.993

[clapping]

03:20.368 --> 03:21.435

03:21.469 --> 03:23.671
- [singsong] SHH, YOU DON'T
WANT THEM TO HEAR YOU.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.472
- I DON'T CARE IF THEY DO.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.806
WHY DID WE GO THROUGH
WITH THIS?

03:25.839 --> 03:27.308
- WE PLANNED IT FOR MONTHS.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.876
WE COULDN'T DISAPPOINT
FRANNY AND ZOE,

03:28.909 --> 03:30.244
HOW WOULD THEY FEEL?

03:30.278 --> 03:31.345
- HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

03:31.379 --> 03:33.447
LIKE A LIAR AND A FOOL.

03:33.481 --> 03:34.315

03:34.348 --> 03:35.849
- SURE, HONEY,
LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.551

04:09.517 --> 04:12.486
- OH, CHRIST,
I WOULD JUST KILL

04:12.520 --> 04:13.687
FOR A CIGARETTE RIGHT
ABOUT NOW.

04:13.721 --> 04:14.922
- MM.

04:14.955 --> 04:18.359
- ALL THIS BABY BUSINESS IS
JUST MAKING ME A LITTLE CRAZY.

04:18.392 --> 04:19.860
- WHY,
BECAUSE YOU WANT ONE?

04:19.893 --> 04:22.596
- BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ONE.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.733
DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I LIKE KIDS.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.568
OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.304
FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES.
- [chuckles]

04:30.338 --> 04:33.574
- I'M MORE OF
A CAREER DYKE MYSELF.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.509
- I USED TO SAY
THE SAME THING.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.711
THAT WAS UNTIL
WE HAD OUR SON.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.514
- HMM.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.783

04:42.816 --> 04:45.919
- I'M MARIANNE MACDONALD.
DEFINITELY NOT A ROLE MODEL.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.055
- WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.458
- THOUGH, I SUPPOSE

04:50.491 --> 04:54.862
YOU COULD SAY I AM "PC."

04:54.895 --> 05:00.534
THAT IS, IF PC STANDS FOR
"PERFORMS CUNNILINGUS".

05:00.568 --> 05:03.471
- [laughs]
OH, GOD, YOU'RE WICKED.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.873

05:41.008 --> 05:42.843

05:42.876 --> 05:44.478
OR HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN?

05:44.512 --> 05:46.747

05:52.620 --> 05:54.422

OH, YEAH, YEAH.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.595

06:01.629 --> 06:03.997

06:05.032 --> 06:06.500
I'M FINE.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.634
AND I WANT TO GO.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.002
ALL THOSE MEN,

06:42.035 --> 06:44.738
ALL THOSE DRUGS.

06:44.772 --> 06:47.007
SORRY.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.177
AND THAT'S NOT THE WORST
OF IT.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.514
TODAY I ALMOST SOLD

06:53.547 --> 06:55.082
MY GRANDFATHER GAVE ME

06:55.115 --> 06:58.151
[clears throat]
TO BUY A TICKET FOR

06:58.185 --> 07:00.854
BARBRA'S
ABSOLUTELY FINAL FAREWELL,

I-SWEAR-TO-GOD-THIS-IS-IT
CONCERT.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.592
I MEAN,

07:04.625 --> 07:06.460
I CAN BARELY SURVIVE
ON MY WEEK'S SALARY,

07:06.494 --> 07:08.929
AND I'M GOING TO HELP FILL
MRS. BROLIN'S COFFER?

07:08.962 --> 07:11.164
SICK.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.633
I'M SICK.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.867
- BUT THERE'S A CURE.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.836
THAT'S WHY YOU CAME TO
"SEE THE LIGHT."

07:15.869 --> 07:17.237
BELIEVE ME,
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.440
I'VE BEEN THERE.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.477
LOOK AT THIS.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.845
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.179
- A PICTURE OF A DRAG QUEEN.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.549
OR YOUR MOTHER.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.117
- THAT WAS ME.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.686
- NO!
COME ON.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.987
BUT YOU'RE SO...

07:34.021 --> 07:35.923
- STRAIGHT?
THANK YOU.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.958
I KEEP THIS PHOTO
AS A REMINDER

07:37.991 --> 07:39.560
OF MY FORMER LIFE.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.862
BUT EVEN THEN,
I KNEW UNDER ALL THOSE WIGS

07:41.895 --> 07:44.097
AND THOSE FABULOUS GOWNS,

07:44.131 --> 07:47.701
THERE WAS A CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLICAN COMPUTER ANALYST

07:47.735 --> 07:50.671
DYING TO BE FREE.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.540
THAT'S WHAT
"SEE THE LIGHT" DID FOR ME.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.241
AND IT CAN DO THE SAME
FOR YOU,

07:54.274 --> 07:56.644
IF YOU'RE SERIOUS.
- I AM.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.912
I AM SERIOUS,
I SWEAR TO GOD.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.549
- GOOD.
BUT DON'T FOOL YOURSELF.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.716
IT WON'T BE EASY.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.784
AT SOME POINT
YOU MAY EVEN HAVE TO

08:03.817 --> 08:05.018
EXTRICATE YOURSELF FROM

08:05.052 --> 08:07.521
CERTAIN CORRUPT INFLUENCES.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.122
- YOU MEAN MY FRIENDS?

08:09.156 --> 08:10.624
- ARE THEY REALLY
YOUR FRIENDS

08:10.658 --> 08:12.259
IF THEY LEAD YOU
INTO TEMPTATION?

08:12.292 --> 08:14.762
- WELL, THEY NEVER DO IT
DELIBERATELY.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.898
- EMMETT,
IF YOU SEE THE LIGHT,

08:17.931 --> 08:20.568
YOU MUSTN'T ALLOW
ANYTHING OR ANYONE

08:20.601 --> 08:24.538
TO DIVERT YOU
FROM THE PATH.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.309
- THANK YOU, MATT,
FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.078
- HEY,
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,

08:31.111 --> 08:35.248
TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SLIP.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.059
- BRIAN.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.028
- YOU CEO OF THE COMPANY
YET?

08:48.061 --> 08:49.963

GIVE ME A WEEK OR TWO.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.065
SO, MR. RYDER TOLD ME
YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO

08:52.099 --> 08:54.301
USE MY IDEAS

08:54.334 --> 08:57.070
- I'LL STEAL ANYTHING GOOD
AND PUT MY NAME ON IT.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.572
- THAT'S GREAT.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.774
ALTHOUGH BOB AND BRAD
AREN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT IT.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.676
- WELL, PEOPLE WITH NO TALENT
USUALLY AREN'T

09:02.710 --> 09:06.213
WHEN SOMEONE WITH REAL TALENT
COMES ALONG.

09:06.246 --> 09:09.182
- YEAH, I HEAR YOU'RE PRETTY
TALENTED YOURSELF.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.652
IN FACT,
YOU HAVE A REPUTATION.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.053
- I DO?

09:13.086 --> 09:15.756
- FOR BEING THE BEST
ACCOUNT EXEC IN THE COMPANY.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.693
- YEAH. THAT TOO.

09:19.727 --> 09:23.063
- AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED
IF I COULD WORK WITH YOU.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.798
- I THOUGHT RYDER ASSIGNED YOU.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.934
- YEAH. I, UH...

09:26.967 --> 09:28.902
LIED.

09:31.705 --> 09:35.776
- COME HERE FOR A SECOND.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.812
THIS IS A NEW CAMPAIGN
WE'RE STARTING FOR LIBERTY AIR.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.814
I WANT YOU ON THE TEAM.

09:40.848 --> 09:46.153
- OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S--THAT'S FANTASTIC.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.320
WOW.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.623
HOW CAN I EVER THANK YOU?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.963
- BY DOING A GOOD JOB.

09:55.996 --> 09:59.366
- YOU CAN COUNT ON IT.

10:06.674 --> 10:08.608
[door closes]

10:10.744 --> 10:13.246
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU CAN...

10:13.280 --> 10:15.949
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME
FOR ANYTHING.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.251
DAY OR NIGHT.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.188
- WELL, YOU REALLY ARE GOING
FOR THE GOLD WATCH.

10:21.221 --> 10:24.191
- I MEAN IT.

10:28.696 --> 10:32.733
BECAUSE I THINK
YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY AMAZING.

10:38.038 --> 10:41.742
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.076
- SHIT.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.845
I'M SORRY, UM...

10:44.878 --> 10:47.414
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

10:47.447 --> 10:50.951
LOOK, I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.322
- YEAH, WELL,
WHATEVER IT WAS,

10:55.355 --> 10:59.960
YOU THOUGHT WRONG
BECAUSE...

10:59.993 --> 11:02.195
I'M THE ONE...

11:44.004 --> 11:46.506
- YOU FUCKED HIM IN YOUR OFFICE?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.175
- HE WAS THE BEST THING
TO COME ACROSS MY DESK

11:48.208 --> 11:50.110
IN A LONG TIME.
- YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.745
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.214
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.
- DON'T TELL ME

11:54.247 --> 11:56.249
NO ONE'S EVER HAD
A BIG "O" AT THE BIG "Q."

11:56.283 --> 11:58.886
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.
- WELL, I WOULD.

11:58.919 --> 11:59.953
FROM FIRSTHAND.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.489
AND I MEAN,
"FIRSTHAND" EXPERIENCE.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.690
- ARE YOU SAYING--

12:03.723 --> 12:06.093
- YOU REMEMBER LAST CHRISTMAS
WHEN I CAME TO PICK YOU UP

12:06.126 --> 12:07.961
AND YOU WERE SETTING UP
FOR SANTA'S WORKSHOP?

12:07.995 --> 12:11.131
- NOT SANTA. DON'T TELL ME
YOU FUCKED SANTA!

12:11.164 --> 12:15.002
- AH, EVEN I WOULDN'T
DO THAT.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.870
I'M NOT INTO FAT.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.772
HIS ELF.

12:18.806 --> 12:19.840
- YOU DIDN'T!

12:19.873 --> 12:23.510
- WHAT HE LACKED IN FEET
HE MADE UP FOR IN INCHES.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.313
- I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.348
BUT YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.250
I MEAN,
DOING IT IN YOUR OFFICE

12:30.283 --> 12:32.953
MAY BE A LITTLE TOO HIGH-RISK
EVEN FOR YOU.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.522
- BUT HE ASKED FOR IT,
HE CAME ON TO ME.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.457
I GAVE HIM A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY

12:37.490 --> 12:39.159
AND A GREAT FUCK.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.996
HE HAS NO COMPLAINTS.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.865
- WELL, IT WAS OUR PLEASURE,
FRANNY.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.967
YEAH, WE HAD FUN TOO.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.336
SO, I GUESS
IT'S ANY DAY NOW.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.537
WELL, WHEN IT HAPPENS,
DON'T WORRY.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.372
WE'LL BE THERE, OKAY?

12:52.405 --> 12:54.241
LOVE TO ZOE.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.576
AND MEL SENDS HER LOVE TOO.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.546
[scribbling]
OKAY. BYE.

13:01.148 --> 13:04.017
FRANNY AND ZOE SEND THEIR LOVE.
- THAT'S NICE.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.452
- THEY REALLY APPRECIATED
THE SHOWER,

13:05.485 --> 13:06.553
AND THEY REALLY LIKED
THE MOBILE

13:06.586 --> 13:08.121
I MADE FOR OVER THE CRIB.

13:08.155 --> 13:11.424
- DON'T YOU EVER GET TIRED
OF BEING CHEERY?

13:11.458 --> 13:14.494
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

13:14.527 --> 13:15.896
- WELL, I'M TIRED.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.430
I'M TIRED OF PUTTING
IN THESE EXTRA HOURS

13:17.464 --> 13:19.532
SO YOU CAN BE WITH THE BABY,
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST

13:19.566 --> 13:22.035
GO BE WITH THE BABY?
- IT'S NOT JUST FOR ME.

13:22.069 --> 13:23.971
I WISH YOU'D STOP SAYING THAT.
IT'S SO GUS--

13:24.004 --> 13:25.205
- CAN BE RAISED BY ONE
OF HIS MOMMIES

13:25.238 --> 13:26.139
INSTEAD OF A STRANGER.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.375
NOW, CAN I PLEASE
JUST GET BACK TO WORK?

13:28.408 --> 13:29.977
- NOT UNTIL YOU APOLOGIZE

13:30.010 --> 13:31.979
FOR THE WAY YOU BEHAVED
AT THE SHOWER.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.380
- HOW DID I BEHAVE?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.115
- YOU WERE RUDE,
CRITICAL,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.349
HALF THE TIME
YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.919
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR?
SMILING AND GRACIOUS AS EVER,

13:38.952 --> 13:40.854
AS IF NOTHING'S WRONG.
- OH, PLENTY IS WRONG.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.489
WE JUST DON'T HAVE TO SHARE IT
WITH OUR FRIENDS.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.623
- WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.392
MAYBE OUR FRIENDS SHOULD KNOW
THAT THEIR ROLE MODELS

13:45.425 --> 13:49.329
AREN'T SO PERFECT AFTER ALL.

13:49.362 --> 13:50.530
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:50.563 --> 13:53.967
- FOR A SMOKE.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.608
- "SHAVING RYAN'S PRIVATES",
"GOOD DICK HUNTING",

14:01.641 --> 14:03.610
"AS BIG AS IT GETS".

14:03.643 --> 14:05.045
IT DID GET BIG.

14:05.078 --> 14:07.347
GONE.

14:07.380 --> 14:12.285
OH, "FATAL ERECTION".
FILM CLASSIC.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.121
I DON'T SUPPOSE
IT WOULD DO ANY HARM TO--

14:14.154 --> 14:17.357
NO. GONE.

14:17.390 --> 14:21.228
[sighs]
STERLING SILVER COCK RING.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.296
LOOKED FABULOUS ON.

14:23.330 --> 14:25.532
BUT IT DID REQUIRE
A LOT OF POLISHING,

14:25.565 --> 14:27.901
SO, GONE!

14:27.935 --> 14:28.902
- HI, EM!

14:28.936 --> 14:31.204
- OH, HI.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.372
- I JUST CAME BY

14:32.405 --> 14:35.175
- AH, IT'S RIGHT THERE.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.980
- AND WANTED TO SEE IF YOU
WANTED TO GRAB A BITE TO--

14:40.013 --> 14:41.148
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:41.181 --> 14:43.383
- SPRING CLEANING.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.385

14:53.160 --> 14:57.497

PORN TAPES.

14:59.432 --> 15:01.468
[blows air]

15:01.501 --> 15:03.403
AND A DOUBLE-HEADED DILDO.
- [snorts]

15:03.436 --> 15:04.504
- WELL,
YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE

15:04.537 --> 15:08.475
SOME LUCKY BAG LADY
VERY HAPPY.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.342
- ALL RIGHT.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.544
MIGHT AS WELL
BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.014
both: STRAIGHT.
- MM-HMM.

15:14.047 --> 15:17.017
- IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE,
YOU KNOW.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.052
LOOK, I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE MY FRIENDS,

15:19.086 --> 15:20.587
AND YOU'LL SUPPORT ME
IN ANYTHING

15:20.620 --> 15:22.322
I CHOOSE TO DO.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.523
- OF COURSE.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.058
- WEREN'T WE THERE
TO CHEER YOU ON

15:25.092 --> 15:29.262
WHEN YOU PAINTED
YOUR TOENAILS MAGENTA?

15:29.296 --> 15:32.632
- I'VE DECIDED THAT
I NEED TO EXPLORE

15:32.665 --> 15:36.036
THE PART OF ME
THAT ISN'T GAY.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.071
- AND WHAT PART, PRAY TELL,
WOULD THAT BE?

15:38.105 --> 15:41.408
- SO, I'M--I'VE JOINED
THIS GROUP,

15:41.441 --> 15:42.409
"SEE THE LIGHT."

15:42.442 --> 15:44.711
- OH, SHIT.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.446
- AND THEY'RE GOING
TO HELP ME FIND MY WAY

15:46.479 --> 15:47.247
BACK TO MY TRUE SELF.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.582
- WHO YOU ARE
IS YOUR TRUE SELF.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.252
- NO, THIS IS WHO
I'VE ALLOWED MYSELF TO BECOME.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.420
- THAT'S BULLSHIT!

15:53.453 --> 15:55.755
- THEY SAID
YOU MIGHT REACT BADLY.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.624
- YEAH, WHAT ELSE
DID THEY SAY?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.392
- THAT I COULD BE THE PERSON
GOD WANTS ME TO BE.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.062
- JESUS, EMMETT,
THEY'RE BRAINWASHING YOU.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.663
- NO, THEY'RE NOT.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.632
THEY'RE
VERY, VERY NICE PEOPLE.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.134
- YEAH, WHO JUST HAPPEN
TO WANT EVERY GAY PERSON

16:07.167 --> 16:08.301
ON EARTH ANNIHILATED.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.503
- THEY HAVEN'T OFFERED YOU
ANY KOOL-AID YET, HAVE THEY?

16:10.537 --> 16:14.441
- YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T
APPRECIATE BEING MOCKED.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.076
[video tapes clatter]

16:16.109 --> 16:18.678
- THAT'S THE NAPKIN
THAT LIZA AUTOGRAPHED TO YOU.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.647
- GONE.

16:23.183 --> 16:24.617
- THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.652
I'M THE ONE WHO BEGGED HIM

16:25.685 --> 16:27.354
TO COME WITH ME
FOR MY HIV TEST.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.356
IF HE HADN'T HAD THAT SCARE,
THIS NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.225
- YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIM LOSING HIS MIND.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.227
MAYBE ALL HE NEEDS
IS ONE GOOD FUCK

16:34.261 --> 16:36.463
AND HE'LL FORGET
ALL ABOUT THIS.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.100
LOOK AT THIS.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.102
ZACK O'TOOL IS IN A PLAY.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.636
- THE PORN STAR?

16:43.670 --> 16:46.539
- I HAVE HIS ENTIRE OEUVRE
ON DVD.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.541
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HE COULD TALK.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.143
- I WONDER WHAT KIND OF PLAY
IT IS.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.178
- WELL, WHAT KIND OF PLAY
DO YOU THINK

16:51.211 --> 16:55.348
SOMETHING CALLED
TWELVE HORNY MEN IS?

16:55.382 --> 16:56.783
- WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT?

16:56.816 --> 16:58.485
- [sighs]

16:58.518 --> 17:01.788
THAT FEELS SO GOOD.
[laughs]

17:03.090 --> 17:04.791
THERE ARE TIMES
I WOULD DO ANYTHING

17:04.824 --> 17:07.127
FOR A CIGARETTE.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.696
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

17:12.299 --> 17:13.366
- [exhales]

17:13.400 --> 17:16.269
- SO, WHY DON'T YOU
INDULGE YOURSELF

17:16.303 --> 17:17.837
WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE IT?

17:17.870 --> 17:21.141
- I GAVE UP SMOKING
WHEN THE BABY CAME.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.276
LINDSAY WAS CONCERNED
ABOUT SECONDHAND SMOKE,

17:23.310 --> 17:24.077
AND SHE'S RIGHT.

17:24.111 --> 17:24.911
- IS LINDSAY
ONE OF THESE PEOPLE

17:24.944 --> 17:26.813
WHO IS ALWAYS
INFURIATINGLY RIGHT?

17:26.846 --> 17:30.183
- ABOUT ALMOST EVERYTHING,
DAMN HER.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.524
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU WERE SUCH A RELIEF.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.426
I MEAN, AT THE SHOWER,

17:39.459 --> 17:41.661
EVERYONE TALKING BABIES,
BREATHING BABIES.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.796
- YES,
IT WAS A BIT OPPRESSIVE.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.166
- I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I LOVE MY SON.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.167
BUT SOMETIMES--

17:47.200 --> 17:48.768
- SOMETIMES...

17:48.801 --> 17:52.639
YOU JUST NEED SOMETHING ELSE.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.278
- [clears throat]

17:58.311 --> 17:59.846
DO YOU MIND IF I BUM ANOTHER?

17:59.879 --> 18:01.714
- HAVE THE WHOLE PACK.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.185
- [chuckles] NO, THAT'S OKAY.
ONE'LL DO.

18:05.218 --> 18:08.188
- THANK YOU.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.623
- [exhales]

18:10.657 --> 18:11.624
"M.M."?

18:11.658 --> 18:12.859
- YEAH.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.461
YOU, ME, AND MARILYN MONROE.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.730
WE ALL HAVE
THE SAME INITIALS.

18:17.764 --> 18:18.731
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT MEANS?

18:18.765 --> 18:21.301
- JESUS, THAT TWO OUT OF
THREE OF US ARE DYKES.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.636
- YOU KNOW,
I ACTUALLY HEARD--

18:23.670 --> 18:25.405
- NO, STOP.
[laughs]

18:25.438 --> 18:28.375
OH, GOD!
- I'M SERIOUS.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.444
WELL, I THINK
THAT THIS IS FATE.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.547
JUST WHEN YOU NEEDED SOMEONE
TO TELL YOUR TROUBLES TO.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.683
[overlapping chatter]

18:36.716 --> 18:38.851
NOT THAT YOU HAVE
TO TELL ME,

18:38.885 --> 18:40.720
CONSIDERING I AM
YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND

18:40.753 --> 18:43.756
AND WEED PUSHER.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.759
- LOOK,
EVERYONE HAS THEIR...

18:46.793 --> 18:49.762
- YEAH, I KNOW.
HA.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.866
AND WAIT TILL
YOU GET A LOAD OF MINE.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.238
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
SOMETHING.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.507
THAT WHATEVER'S SAID HERE
AT THIS TABLE

19:00.540 --> 19:03.843
DOESN'T GO ANY FURTHER.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.813
GIRL SCOUT'S HONOR.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.350
[glasses clinking]

19:13.453 --> 19:15.922
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN ME?

19:15.955 --> 19:18.525
I DON'T DO DATES.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.260
- IT'S NOT A DATE.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.195
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU WANT

19:22.229 --> 19:24.931
TO COME TO BABYLON
WITH ME.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.570
- THE ANSWER'S NO.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.505
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.242
- SINCE WHEN HAS
THAT EVER STOPPED YOU?

19:35.275 --> 19:37.810
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE STUDYING
FOR YOUR S.A.T.s.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.781
- DANCING HELPS ME CONCENTRATE.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.350
SERIOUSLY.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.552
YEAH, IT RELEASES
CERTAIN ENDORPHINS

19:45.585 --> 19:47.420
SO THAT I CAN STUDY HARDER

19:47.454 --> 19:49.289
AND FOR LONGER PERIODS
OF TIME.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.324
- HMM, SO BABYLON IS GOOD
FOR YOUR HEALTH.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.892

20:03.703 --> 20:05.605

20:05.638 --> 20:07.707
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
- KIP?

20:07.740 --> 20:11.611
- AND IT IS BUSINESS,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.812
- I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE
TO FIND

20:12.845 --> 20:14.281
SOMEONE ELSE TO DANCE WITH.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.548
IT SHOULDN'T BE
A PROBLEM.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.984
- AND THEN YOU CAN STUDY
LONGER AND HARDER.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.286
- [grunts]

20:19.319 --> 20:23.456
[elevator hums]

20:24.491 --> 20:26.459

YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE
FINDING IT?

20:29.429 --> 20:30.863

TO DRINK?

20:42.475 --> 20:45.878
- YEAH, YOU GOT A BEER?
- YEAH.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.781
- SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND
MY ASKING,

20:48.815 --> 20:52.452
HOW MUCH DOES A PLACE
LIKE THIS COST?

20:52.485 --> 20:55.522
- MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD
ON YOUR CURRENT SALARY.

20:55.555 --> 20:59.392
- YEAH, BUT NOT FOR LONG.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.694
- YEAH.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.530
I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING
TO GO FAR.

21:03.563 --> 21:05.465
[bottles clink]

21:06.566 --> 21:08.501
- YOU MIND IF I TAKE
A LOOK AROUND?

21:08.535 --> 21:10.370
- GO AHEAD.

21:10.403 --> 21:13.806
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

SO, WHY DON'T WE...

GET...

21:38.498 --> 21:39.932
STARTED?

21:39.966 --> 21:43.703
- THAT'S JUST
WHAT I HAD IN MIND.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.539
- WE'VE BEEN LOCKED IN
THIS JURY ROOM FOR THREE DAYS.

21:46.573 --> 21:50.410
THREE DAYS
TRYING TO REACH A VERDICT.

21:50.443 --> 21:55.682
THREE DAYS
WITH NO HUMAN CONTACT.

21:55.715 --> 21:59.619
THREE DAYS BREATHING
THE AIR IN HERE,

21:59.652 --> 22:02.689
THICK WITH THE SMELL
OF MAN-STENCH.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.657

22:04.691 --> 22:05.958
YOU EVER HEARD
SUCH DIALOGUE?

22:05.992 --> 22:08.094

IT'S BRILLIANT.

22:08.127 --> 22:10.763

THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY

22:10.797 --> 22:14.401

[cheers and applause]

22:27.947 --> 22:32.885
[cheers and applause]

22:35.888 --> 22:36.856
- THIS MUST BE
HOW THEY REACHED

22:36.889 --> 22:38.758
THE VERDICT
IN THE O.J. TRIAL.

22:38.791 --> 22:42.128
- AND THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A HUNG JURY.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.496

23:03.650 --> 23:04.684
UH...

23:04.717 --> 23:07.086
- THAT WAS
A VERY INTERESTING PLAY.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.821
- TO ME,
IT CHALLENGES THE VERY NATURE

23:08.855 --> 23:10.156
OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM
AND ASKS,

23:10.189 --> 23:12.859
"IS IT IN FACT POSSIBLE
TO RECEIVE A FAIR TRIAL?"

23:12.892 --> 23:14.827
- OH, I'D SAY
OUR JUDICIAL BRANCH

23:14.861 --> 23:17.964
IS IN FINE SHAPE.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.700
- SO, WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO SIGN YOUR PROGRAMS?

23:20.733 --> 23:23.503
- ACTUALLY, MR. O'TOOL--

23:23.536 --> 23:24.904
OH, MY GOD,
I CAN'T BELIEVE

23:24.937 --> 23:28.140
I'M ACTUALLY TALKING

23:28.174 --> 23:31.711
WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU EVER
DID PERSONAL APPEARANCES?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.112

23:43.490 --> 23:46.793
IS HAVING CERTAIN DOUBTS
ABOUT HIMSELF,

23:46.826 --> 23:48.895
AND SINCE
YOU ARE HIS VERY FAVORITE,

23:48.928 --> 23:51.063
FAVORITE PORN STAR,

23:51.097 --> 23:52.599
WE THOUGHT A VISIT
FROM YOU MIGHT--

23:52.632 --> 23:54.200
- TELL HIM TO COME SEE
MY SHOW

23:54.233 --> 23:56.202
OR WAIT TILL NEXT MONTH.

23:56.235 --> 23:59.238

YOU'RE GOING OR EVEN CALL?

26:17.176 --> 26:18.344
WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO GUS

26:18.377 --> 26:20.212
AND I NEEDED YOU?

26:20.246 --> 26:28.187

I WENT FOR A CIGARETTE.

26:36.395 --> 26:39.932

- AREN'T I ALLOWED ANY TIME
TO MYSELF?

27:28.147 --> 27:31.250
- OF COURSE YOU ARE.

27:31.283 --> 27:34.386
I WAS JUST WORRIED.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.213
- OKAY,
THAT--THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.381
- AND WHY'S THAT?

28:35.414 --> 28:36.949
- BECAUSE THAT'S ME.

28:36.983 --> 28:40.119
- WELL, I HEARD YOU'RE
ONE OF MY BIGGEST FANS.

28:40.152 --> 28:43.522
SO I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY

29:29.568 --> 29:31.303
WHEN YOU RAPE THE TWO BUSBOYS.

29:31.337 --> 29:32.805

THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY
IN DEEP END: PART 2

29:38.544 --> 29:40.146
WHEN YOU RAPE
THE TWO POOL BOYS.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.149

30:18.450 --> 30:21.053
- I'VE GOT A MEETING OUTSIDE
THE OFFICE IN 20 MINUTES.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.855

MEETING OUTSIDE THE OFFICE.

30:22.889 --> 30:25.291
- WHAT?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.459
[laughs]
OH.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.195
- SO WHEN DO YOU WANT
TO GET TOGETHER?

30:29.228 --> 30:30.629
- ASK CYNTHIA
TO CHECK MY SCHEDULE.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.264
MAYBE AFTER
THE SCHULMANN MEETING.

30:32.298 --> 30:33.565

30:33.599 --> 30:35.902

I'M LATE.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.269

30:37.303 --> 30:41.173
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.875
- YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.044
- DAVE HARCOURT'S BEING
BUMPED UP TO DIRECTOR,

30:45.077 --> 30:46.412
WHICH MEANS
HIS MANAGER POSITION'S

30:46.445 --> 30:47.646
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.648
I'D LIKE TO GO UP FOR IT.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.918
AND I'D LIKE YOU
TO RECOMMEND ME.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.953
I THINK I'D BE DAMN GOOD.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.658

30:59.691 --> 31:00.659
- THEN WHY
DO YOU KEEP TELLING ME

31:00.692 --> 31:02.394
HOW GREAT MY IDEAS ARE?

31:02.428 --> 31:04.596
- THEY ARE, BUT YOU STILL
HAVE A LOT TO LEARN.

31:04.630 --> 31:05.898
- I CAN LEARN ON THE JOB.

31:05.932 --> 31:07.466
- I ADMIRE YOUR AMBITION,

31:07.499 --> 31:09.501
BUT YOU NEED THE EXPERIENCE
TO BACK IT UP.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.204
GIVE IT TIME.
- I DON'T HAVE TIME.

31:12.238 --> 31:14.373
BY THEN THEY'LL HAVE GIVEN IT
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

31:14.406 --> 31:18.344
LOOK, I KNOW I'D BE PERFECT.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.979

YOU'RE NOT READY.

31:27.153 --> 31:29.188

31:29.221 --> 31:31.290
NO ONE IN THE GROUP'S
HAD A GIRL YET.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.292
- I KNOW TWO GUYS,
HARRY AND SAM,

31:33.325 --> 31:34.660
THEY JUST HAD A LITTLE GIRL.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.267
I WAS AT THE SHOWER.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.601

I HOPE YOU TWO TAKE CARE
OF EACH OTHER.

31:58.184 --> 32:01.053
YOU KNOW,
PROTECT WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

32:01.087 --> 32:05.157
YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE IT.

32:28.714 --> 32:30.549
I MEAN, IT WASN'T

32:30.582 --> 32:32.018
THAT YOU AND LINDS

YOU TWO LOOKED.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.456
- YOU TWO LOOK THE SAME WAY.

32:37.489 --> 32:41.027
- WOULD YOU GUYS EXCUSE ME?

32:47.033 --> 32:49.968

32:53.039 --> 32:55.607
- WE WERE RADIANT,
WEREN'T WE?

32:55.641 --> 32:57.509
WHEN WE WERE HERE,
WHEN WE HAD GUS,

32:57.543 --> 32:58.610
WE WERE SO HAPPY.

32:58.644 --> 33:03.182
- YEAH, IT WAS THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.117
OUR LIVES.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.119
- [clears throat]

33:09.455 --> 33:12.158
SO, HOW DID IT GET TO THIS?

33:12.191 --> 33:14.560
- TO WHAT?
- TO WHERE WE ARE.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.763
- [sighs]
WE HAVE OUR PROBLEMS, BUT--

33:17.796 --> 33:20.066
- NO, THEY'RE JUST
NOT PROBLEMS.

33:20.099 --> 33:21.333
EVERYTHING'S WRONG.

33:21.367 --> 33:24.470
- NOT EVERYTHING.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.138
LOOK, I'VE BEEN THINKING.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.773
IF IT WOULD HELP
TO TALK TO SOMEONE,

33:27.806 --> 33:31.643
THEN THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO,
LIKE YOU SAID.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.248
- SOMETHING HAPPENED.

33:36.282 --> 33:38.484
- WHAT?

33:41.187 --> 33:44.723
- SOMETHING...HAPPENED.

33:44.756 --> 33:48.127
I-I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT TO,

33:48.160 --> 33:50.529
BUT IT DID.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.431
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DO YOU--

33:52.464 --> 33:55.434
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

34:04.176 --> 34:06.412
YOU...

34:20.226 --> 34:22.161
WHO WAS IT?

34:22.194 --> 34:25.564
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.834
- THE NURSE HAS COME
TO GET THE BABY.

34:28.867 --> 34:32.171
YOU ONLY HAVE
A FEW MORE MINUTES.

34:41.447 --> 34:45.217

[rock music]

34:58.497 --> 35:00.666
*

35:00.699 --> 35:03.369
- YOU HOOKED EMMETT UP
WITH ZACK O'TOOL?

35:03.402 --> 35:06.272
- I WISH I COULD'VE BEEN
THERE TO SEE HIS FACE

35:06.305 --> 35:07.606
WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.475
- AND JUST SAW HIM
STANDING THERE.

35:09.508 --> 35:11.777
- ZACK O'TOOL'S SUPPOSED
TO HAVE A 12-INCH DICK.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.779
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHO ZACK O'TOOL IS?

35:13.812 --> 35:16.848
- EVERYBODY KNOWS
WHO THE MANRAMMER IS.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.484
- EVEN SCHOOLBOYS?

35:18.517 --> 35:20.219
- OF COURSE.
THAT'S PART OF THE CURRICULUM.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.787
GAY PORN STARS 101.

35:21.820 --> 35:22.821

AND HERE'S THE FIRST LESSON:

35:22.854 --> 35:24.256
THOSE THAT CAN, DO

35:24.290 --> 35:27.759

WATCH PORN.

35:30.529 --> 35:33.399
SEE YOU, BOYS.

35:37.869 --> 35:40.372
- HEY, BRIAN.

35:40.406 --> 35:41.773
YOU WANNA DANCE?

35:41.807 --> 35:43.575
- I DON'T THINK SO.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.844
- WE'RE NOT IN THE OFFICE NOW.
LET'S GET DOWN.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.279
- I'M BUSY.

35:47.313 --> 35:50.882
OR AT LEAST I WAS.
WHAT'RE YOU ON?

35:50.916 --> 35:51.950
- COUPLE BUMPS.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.386
- YOU SHOULDN'T LET
SENIOR MANAGEMENT KNOW THAT.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.554
- I'M JUST CELEBRATING.

35:55.587 --> 35:57.289
SEE, TONIGHT'S
A SPECIAL OCCASION.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.191
- OH?
- YEAH, YOU DIDN'T HEAR?

35:59.225 --> 36:00.792
JIM CLEMENSKI
GOT THAT POSITION.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.262
YOU KNOW THE ONE
YOU WOULDN'T RECOMMEND ME FOR?

36:03.295 --> 36:05.364
- LOOK, I TOLD YOU--
- YOU OWED IT TO ME.

36:05.397 --> 36:07.666
- WHY,
BECAUSE I FUCKED YOU?

36:07.699 --> 36:10.736
YOU WEREN'T THAT GOOD.

36:14.306 --> 36:17.676
- I'M GAY, YOU'RE GAY.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.978
- YEAH, WE'RE ALL GAY.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.614
DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS
I OWE YOU SOME FAVOR?

36:22.648 --> 36:24.450
- HOW ELSE ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO GET AHEAD

36:24.483 --> 36:25.917
IF WE DON'T HELP EACH OTHER?

36:25.951 --> 36:27.786
[man moaning]

36:27.819 --> 36:30.956
- THE SAME WAY THAT I DID,
BY HELPING YOURSELF.

36:30.989 --> 36:34.460
YEAH, AND BY DOING YOUR JOB
BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.728
IF YOU CAN DO THAT,
THEN TRUST ME,

36:36.762 --> 36:38.864
THEY WON'T GIVE A SHIT
WHERE YOU STICK YOUR DICK.

36:38.897 --> 36:41.667
AND DON'T MIX THAT
WITH BOOZE.

36:41.700 --> 36:46.238
THERE,
I DID YOU A FAVOR.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.007
- WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?
CALL ME.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.909
THAT'S THE FOURTH MESSAGE
I'VE LEFT FOR HIM.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.311
- HE'S PROBABLY STILL
RECOVERING

36:52.344 --> 36:54.980
FROM HAVING ZACK O'TOOL
FUCK HIS BRAINS OUT.

36:55.013 --> 36:55.914
- WELL, IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
FOR HIM

36:55.947 --> 36:57.583
NEVER TO THINK OF
"SEE THE LIGHT" AGAIN,

36:57.616 --> 36:59.718
THEN THAT $1,000
I SPENT WAS WELL WORTH IT.

36:59.751 --> 37:02.588
- OH, GOD.

37:06.358 --> 37:07.459
OH, THERE HE IS!

37:07.493 --> 37:08.860
EM! EMMETT!

37:08.894 --> 37:10.862

37:18.304 --> 37:20.639
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
- DID YOU GET OUR MESSAGES?

37:20.672 --> 37:22.508
- I'VE BEEN BUSY.
- I'LL BET YOU HAVE.

37:22.541 --> 37:24.543
[chuckles]
- SO, COME HAVE A DRINK WITH US.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.545
- I CAN'T.
I'M MEETING SOMEONE.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.979
- A GUY?

37:28.013 --> 37:30.749
- IF YOU MUST KNOW, YES.
HIS NAME'S MATT.

37:30.782 --> 37:35.621
- GUYS NAMED MATT ARE
BY MY CALCULATION, 87.5% CUTE.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.489
- IT MUST HAVE WORKED.

37:37.523 --> 37:38.757
- SO, TELL US ALL ABOUT IT.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.326
- ALL ABOUT WHAT?

37:40.359 --> 37:41.360
- THE OTHER NIGHT.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.894
- THE OTHER NIGHT?

37:42.928 --> 37:44.663
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN A CERTAIN SOMEONE

37:44.696 --> 37:46.598
WITH A WELL-ENDOWED SOMETHING

37:46.632 --> 37:49.401
CAME A TAP-TAP-TAPPING
AT YOUR CHAMBER DOOR.

37:49.435 --> 37:50.736
- OH, YOU MEAN ZACK.

37:50.769 --> 37:51.770
- "OH, YOU MEAN ZACK."

37:51.803 --> 37:53.372
I LOVE HOW
HE'S SO BLASE ABOUT IT.

37:53.405 --> 37:55.507
- IT WAS QUITE
AN EYE-OPENING EXPERIENCE.

37:55.541 --> 37:56.942
AND I OWE IT ALL TO YOU.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.009
- OH, ANYTHING FOR A FRIEND.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.978
- JUST AS LONG
AS IT DID THE TRICK.

38:00.011 --> 38:01.413
- IT DID THE TRICK
ALL RIGHT.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.949
I REALLY--I CAN'T
THANK YOU ENOUGH.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.385
IT HELPED ME PROVE
TO MYSELF THAT

38:06.418 --> 38:08.954
I CAN RESIST ANY TEMPTATION,

38:08.987 --> 38:10.856
EVEN THE ONLY MAN
I'VE EVER HAD

38:10.889 --> 38:12.624
A SPONTANEOUS ORGASM OVER,

38:12.658 --> 38:16.395
PROVIDED MY RESOLVE
IS STRONG ENOUGH.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.029
- WHAT?

38:18.063 --> 38:19.965
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING?

38:19.998 --> 38:21.933
- TALKED.
- YOU TALKED?

38:21.967 --> 38:24.470
- DID YOU KNOW THAT HE STUDIED
ACTING WITH UTA HAGEN,

38:24.503 --> 38:25.437
AND HE'S FLUENT
IN THREE LANGUAGES?

38:25.471 --> 38:26.304
- YEAH, THAT'S NOT THE KIND
OF TONGUE ACTION

38:26.338 --> 38:29.941
I PAID $1,000 FOR.
- YOU PAID $1,000?

38:29.975 --> 38:31.076
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DID,
BUDDY.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.678
- WOW.

38:32.711 --> 38:33.945
THEY TOLD ME
YOU WOULD STOP AT NOTHING

38:33.979 --> 38:36.415
TO PREVENT ME FROM FINDING
MY TRUE SELF,

38:36.448 --> 38:37.549
AND THEY WERE RIGHT.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.850
- EMMETT, LISTEN TO ME.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.787
YOU'VE ALREADY FOUND
YOUR TRUE SELF.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.055
- YOUR TRUE SELF IS
A BIG, NELLY QUEEN

38:44.089 --> 38:46.024
WHO LIKES TO GET DOWN
ON HIS KNEES AND SUCK COCK,

38:46.057 --> 38:47.926
AND ONCE A YEAR ON HALLOWEEN

38:47.959 --> 38:49.561
DRESS UP
AS THE UGLIEST FUCKING CHER

38:49.595 --> 38:50.962
THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.

38:50.996 --> 38:53.098
AND THAT'S OKAY.

38:53.131 --> 38:55.767
NOW, YOU'VE GOT TO GET AWAY
FROM THOSE SICKO CREEPS

38:55.801 --> 38:56.868
BEFORE THEY DESTROY YOU.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.738
- NO, NO.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.740
ACTUALLY, IT'S YOU
I HAVE TO GET AWAY FROM.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.709
THEY TRIED TO TELL ME THAT,

39:03.742 --> 39:05.511
ONLY I DIDN'T WANT TO
BELIEVE THEM.

39:05.544 --> 39:09.014
BUT NOW I SEE THE LIGHT.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.782
- * CAN YOU HEAR

39:10.816 --> 39:14.453

39:38.477 --> 39:40.646
I'VE CAUSED ENOUGH HARM.

39:40.679 --> 39:43.815
I WOULD ONLY BE DESTRUCTIVE
TO YOU, TO ME, TO GUS.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.518

WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

39:46.552 --> 39:48.654
TO HER?

39:50.756 --> 39:52.858
- THERE WAS NEVER
ANY INTENTION OF IT

39:52.891 --> 39:54.660
ON EITHER OF OUR PARTS
TO BE ANYTHING

39:54.693 --> 39:56.495
MORE THAN WHAT IT WAS.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.597
I'M GOING TO GO STAY
AT MY COUSIN RITA'S.

39:58.630 --> 40:02.901

NEVER THOUGHT WE'D MAKE IT?

40:06.705 --> 40:08.540

40:11.810 --> 40:16.748
- WELL, I THINK SHE DESERVES
THE PRIZE FOR BEING RIGHT, HUH?

40:25.724 --> 40:28.727
WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S EVERYTHING FOR NOW.

40:30.962 --> 40:34.032
CAN I HAVE A MOMENT ALONE
WITH GUS?

40:34.065 --> 40:37.536
[Gus cries]

40:37.569 --> 40:42.007

OOH.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.653
[clears throat]

41:28.153 --> 41:31.122
- WE THOUGHT THE NOSTALGIC
REFERENCE TO THE '50s

41:31.156 --> 41:32.691
WOULD APPEAL
TO THE DENTURE SET.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.593
- BY REMINDING THEM
THAT THEIR BEST YEARS

41:34.626 --> 41:36.628
ARE BEHIND THEM,
AND THAT ALL THEY HAVE

41:36.662 --> 41:37.729
TO LOOK FORWARD TO

41:37.763 --> 41:40.298
IS FURTHER DETERIORATION
AND DEATH?

41:40.331 --> 41:44.269
- WE THOUGHT
IT WOULD MAKE THEM SMILE.

41:44.302 --> 41:46.104
- THEY'RE AFRAID TO SMILE.

41:46.137 --> 41:50.742
THEIR FUCKING TEETH
WILL FALL OUT!

41:50.776 --> 41:53.111

42:11.029 --> 42:12.664

FROM KIP THOMAS'S LAWYER.
