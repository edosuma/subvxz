00:01.760 --> 00:03.680
[Greg]<i> I have to give a report</i>
<i>on your mental state</i>

00:03.720 --> 00:06.240
at your committal
into the murder of
the real Kath Maxwell.

00:06.280 --> 00:09.720
-I won't cooperate.
-[Vera]<i> You might have</i>
<i>convinced Dr. Miller,</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:12.080
but don't think for a second

00:12.120 --> 00:14.080
that I am buying your act.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.520
Oh, fuck! [grunting]

00:16.560 --> 00:18.400
[Will]<i> Find out who put Ann</i>
<i>Reynolds in the hospital.</i>

00:18.440 --> 00:20.040
That's the only way
this will end.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.960
[woman]
<i>You're fuckin' useless!</i>

00:22.000 --> 00:23.920
Your request to apply for
top surgery has been granted.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.880
So you've just got to get a tick
from Dr. Miller to proceed

00:25.920 --> 00:27.400
to the next stage.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.200
The government requires me
to sign off on it.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.160
Mate, I'm trans, not psychotic.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.960
Okay, can you tell me
what happened?

00:33.000 --> 00:35.120
It was just like I was
back there. I just hit him.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.920
He thinks I'm a nutcase,
and he's never,

00:36.960 --> 00:38.560
ever gonna sign off
on my surgery now.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.720
[Judy] I know
who bashed Ann Reynolds.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.680
I saw Lou Kelly
coming out of the kitchen.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.680
-[shouting]
-[sirens blaring]

00:45.720 --> 00:48.160
-Give me Ann Reynolds' attacker.
-[Allie] It was Lou Kelly.

00:48.200 --> 00:49.800
-She bashed Ann Reynolds.
-[Lou] Fuck off!

00:49.840 --> 00:51.600
I didn't fuckin' do it!

00:51.640 --> 00:55.400
This cult you and Lou were in.
How did everyone die?

00:55.440 --> 00:56.680
Poison.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.120
[theme music playing]

01:49.720 --> 01:51.320
[typing on keyboard]

02:02.160 --> 02:04.360
[Jake] Civilian clothes
or prison uniform?

02:06.360 --> 02:08.920
You're on remand. You can wear
your own clothes or the teal.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.160
Up to you.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.640
I'll wear the teal.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.160
I'm Governor Jackson.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.080
We don't have a Protection Unit,

02:22.120 --> 02:24.360
but given the court's
suppression order,

02:24.400 --> 02:26.840
none of the inmates
know who you are
or why you're here.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.400
They don't tend to ask.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.080
But I'd keep your charges
to yourself.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.520
Do you have any questions?

02:34.720 --> 02:36.280
Can I keep this?

02:36.320 --> 02:38.720
You'll get it back.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.200
Eventually.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.600
Does everyone
get the royal welcome?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.200
Only mass murderers.

03:00.800 --> 03:03.040
You can't keep blanking me,
Kath.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.960
Your committal hearing's
this week.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.240
That doesn't concern you?

03:11.200 --> 03:13.320
Why does she hate me so much?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.480
Why don't you ask her?

03:18.760 --> 03:22.280
-I know what I'd hear.
-Mm-hm. What's that?

03:24.120 --> 03:27.800
Do you think Joan sees
herself as a bad person?

03:27.840 --> 03:30.000
'Cause I think if she was
sitting here right now,

03:30.040 --> 03:33.040
she would tell me that
everything she ever did

03:33.080 --> 03:34.880
was necessary.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.480
Good, bad--
it's all relative.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.200
She killed a child.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.720
Have you remembered something?

03:47.280 --> 03:50.480
If you've recovered memories,
Kath, I need to know.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.040
Kath.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.640
-[grunting]
-Kath! Hey! Hey!

04:06.680 --> 04:09.080
Hey! Kath!
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

04:14.440 --> 04:18.040
You won't get anywhere
by hiding from the past.

04:21.960 --> 04:24.720
As hard as it is,
you have to engage with me.

04:26.840 --> 04:32.240
The only way that I can help you
is if you help yourself.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.800
[Will] Yes,
that's where we are.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.440
Ann!

04:43.480 --> 04:45.160
What are you doing here?

04:45.200 --> 04:47.640
Broken ribs hurt
just as much at home, Vera.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.760
I was just commending Will
on keeping it out of the news.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.160
[clears throat]

04:53.280 --> 04:55.080
So did you find out
who attacked me?

04:55.120 --> 04:56.800
Lou Kelly.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.160
Lou Kelly?

04:59.200 --> 05:01.960
She was exposed after
she instigated a riot

05:02.000 --> 05:02.960
to undermine the top dog.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.160
It was part of some play--

05:04.200 --> 05:06.120
Wait. What?
We had a riot?

05:06.160 --> 05:08.040
It was a minor disruption.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.640
It wasn't so minor.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.920
We had to shut down the creche.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.680
But everything's fine now.

05:13.720 --> 05:17.320
In your absence,
I made some decisions
to restore the status quo.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.200
Are you that disgruntled
about being my snitch?

05:36.240 --> 05:38.960
-Fuck you.
-So what...

05:39.000 --> 05:41.560
you stuck the boot in
because you resent me?

05:41.600 --> 05:45.280
Do you really think
I'd risk Reb's surgery?

05:45.320 --> 05:48.320
You might be a cunt, but
you've been true to your word.

05:48.360 --> 05:50.480
[Boomer]
<i>So what do you reckon?</i>

05:50.520 --> 05:52.040
Shh! I'm up to the bit

05:52.080 --> 05:54.000
where he talks about
sucking on your toes.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.520
Aww, yeah.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.960
That one's a bit gross.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.200
You should see his photo.
Hot as<i> fuck.</i>

06:00.240 --> 06:02.360
You better show me hot-as-fuck.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.000
Okay!

06:04.040 --> 06:05.600
Of course it's in your titties.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.920
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.880
Hang on, wait.

06:11.080 --> 06:13.240
[gasps] Boomer!

06:13.280 --> 06:15.680
-I'd almost turn for him.
-Hey!

06:15.720 --> 06:18.600
-Fuck, that's Allie.
-Uh, here.

06:18.640 --> 06:21.000
No, he just Photoshopped
all this together.

06:21.040 --> 06:22.880

07:06.920 --> 07:08.440
Jenkins.

-Yo.
-This is Bausch.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.520
Jenkins is a Peer Worker.
She'll take you under her wing.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.200
That's your cell.
Play nice.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.920

Who's Liz?

07:53.680 --> 07:54.880
Friend of mine.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.240
Sort of like me mum.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.560
She's dead.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.920
How'd she die?

08:01.960 --> 08:04.200
I smothered her
with a pillow.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.520
What you in for?

08:07.560 --> 08:09.640
I didn't think you
were supposed to ask.

08:10.840 --> 08:14.040
-I'm a nosy cow.
-Murder.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.520
Well, you'll be
right at home, then.

08:17.400 --> 08:19.160
So these are the rules, okay?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.240
You keep your door
open at all times.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.680
Don't touch
other people's stuff,
like especially not mine.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.120
And out here's a panic button.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.600
Don't ever press it.

-No.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.400
I just wanna buy some acid.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.640
I just want to forget for a bit.

08:53.680 --> 08:56.000
Couple of tabs is all.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.040
[Ann]
It doesn't make any sense.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.480
I am helping them
with Keane's transition.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.080
Don't expect
gratitude from Kelly.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.200
Our information
came from a reliable source.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.960
-Who?
-You know I can't tell you that.
There are protocols in place.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.320
Well, stuff the protocols.
I am the General Manager.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.440
I have a right to
get to the truth.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.080
-Oh, shit!
-Ann--

09:25.120 --> 09:26.800
[Will] I'm sorry, Ann.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.360
The protocols are there
to protect prison informants.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.440
Yeah, excuse me.

09:31.480 --> 09:34.160
-[Ann] I'm not going
to leak it, Will.
-What is it?

09:34.200 --> 09:37.080
-Is it Grace?
-It's Ferguson.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.200
She wants to speak to you.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.880
Said it's a private matter.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.520
Yeah.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.600
This is it, Vera.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.520
Her committal's in three days.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.880
This is where she pulls some
fuckin' rabbit out of her arse.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.040

10:11.080 --> 10:12.720
[gasps] Oh! Goodness me!

10:51.520 --> 10:53.560
What do you want?

10:53.600 --> 10:56.280
I want to um...

10:56.320 --> 10:59.400
I want to know what it is
that I have done

10:59.440 --> 11:02.480
to deserve your enmity
and disrespect.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.280
[chuckles]

11:07.040 --> 11:08.680
You're not serious.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.040
Dr. Miller suggested
that I speak to you, to ask you.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.720
Even if the response is...

11:17.200 --> 11:18.480
unpalatable.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.080
Un...

11:22.080 --> 11:23.400
palatable.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.200
Hmm.

11:27.440 --> 11:30.360
Well, where do I start, Joan?

11:30.400 --> 11:34.880
Well, how about the time
you let a prisoner

11:34.920 --> 11:38.320
stick a needle in my neck
and infect me with Hepatitis C.

11:38.360 --> 11:39.800
Do you remember that?

11:39.840 --> 11:42.680
Or when you pretended
to mentor me,

11:42.720 --> 11:45.280
but were really manipulating me
the entire time?

11:45.320 --> 11:48.600
Or what about
when you stripped me
of the Deputy Governorship

11:48.640 --> 11:50.160
after publicly shaming me.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.440
Or that time you slapped my face

11:52.480 --> 11:54.320
and threatened to destroy--
No, no, hang on.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.840
What about when you used the man
I fell in love with to seduce

11:57.880 --> 12:00.800
and spy on me and then to betray
and utterly humiliate me?

12:00.840 --> 12:03.120
Let's just cut through
all the bullshit, Joan,

12:03.160 --> 12:05.480
and tell me what the fuck
you really want!

12:15.400 --> 12:17.440
Linda.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.680
Hey, you didn't turn up
to our session this morning.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.440
I was busy.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.760
When the man
who bashed Ferguson was caught,

12:28.800 --> 12:31.840
he had $30,000 on him
that he had stolen from her.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.600
-Do you know what that means?
-Vera--

12:33.640 --> 12:37.160
It means that
she was this close to escaping.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.000
She had worked so hard for it.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.640
It was her total focus.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.200
Her amnesia is part
of that focus, Greg.

12:43.240 --> 12:46.800
Her bloody-minded determination
to win at all costs.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.200
Do you want a cup of tea?

12:52.480 --> 12:56.280
If you testify on Friday
that her amnesia is genuine,

12:56.320 --> 12:58.920
she is going to use that
as the basis for her defense

12:58.960 --> 13:00.560
when it goes to trial.
You know that, don't you?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.920
I'm aware of that possibility,
yeah.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.520
So what are you going
to tell the committal hearing?

13:06.600 --> 13:08.720
I haven't completely decided.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.720
[Reb]
This looks fuckin' delicious.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.240
Corn and carrot, my favorite.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.520
Oi, Ms. Miles?

13:25.560 --> 13:27.000
When's Lou back from the slot?

13:27.040 --> 13:28.480
Up to the Governor.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.160
If it was up to me, Keane,
you'd be all man

13:30.200 --> 13:32.080
by the time she gets
out of the slot.

13:33.840 --> 13:35.480
What are you looking at, Winter?

13:35.520 --> 13:40.280
You used to be all smiles.
Now you're just a cunt.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.600
[Boomer]
And here's the pig trough.

13:42.640 --> 13:44.440
Hope you like shit food.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.080
-Yeah, stay away from the beans.
-Yeah.

13:57.680 --> 14:00.040
[Linda]
Jesus, Keane, pick that up!

14:00.080 --> 14:01.320
Hey!

14:01.360 --> 14:03.680
Keane!
Get back here.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.120
Hey!

14:10.240 --> 14:11.600
[coughing]

14:13.800 --> 14:16.680
My God, it's you.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.000
Rebecca.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.160
What are you doing here?

14:24.400 --> 14:26.040
-Rebecca--
-It's Reb.

14:27.440 --> 14:28.920
Why are you in here?

14:29.880 --> 14:32.320
Um, armed robbery.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.600
What? Armed--

14:35.720 --> 14:37.400
I thought you were dead.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.000
Th--

14:40.040 --> 14:42.440
-This is a miracle--
-Why are you here, Sheila?

14:42.480 --> 14:44.280
I cashed one check too many.

14:45.920 --> 14:49.480
-Oh, so you stole the money.
-I didn't steal anything.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.720
I raised that money
for the clinic

14:51.760 --> 14:54.080
through investments that I made.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.840
When I got back there
that morning,

14:56.880 --> 14:58.640
the whole place was in ashes.

14:58.680 --> 15:02.200
There were bodies...everywhere.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.240
How are you not dead?

15:07.280 --> 15:09.520
Lou-- Lou woke me up.

15:09.560 --> 15:12.880
-Lou?
-She's here.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.440
-With me.
-What? Where?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.360
She's in the slot.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.960
They think I was in on it.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.800
They think that I helped Mendel
poison everyone.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.000
I wasn't even there.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.440
You would know that.
You can tell them it wasn't me.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.600
-Rebecca, you're my savior--
-Reb.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.920
I told you.

15:35.960 --> 15:37.480
Lou woke me up and we just...

15:37.520 --> 15:38.720
we just ran.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.440
I didn't<i> see</i> anything.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.880
Hey, you okay?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.880
Who are you?

15:52.480 --> 15:53.720
I'm Sheila.

15:56.840 --> 15:58.480
Come into my cell, hon.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.960
[flushes toilet]

16:08.840 --> 16:12.520
<i>Okay, Miss Grace.</i>
<i>Are you hungry, love?</i>

16:12.560 --> 16:14.400
-[knock on door]
-Yep.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.640
-You got a sec?
-Yeah.

16:16.680 --> 16:20.240
-Hmm?
-Oh, Jake installed a camera

16:20.280 --> 16:21.520
in the nursery at home.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.480
To perv on the hot nanny?

16:23.520 --> 16:24.760
Yeah, probably.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.360
-How are the ribs?
-Yeah, I'll live.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.360
Mm-hm.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.800
Look, I know I was a bit short
with you earlier, and I'm sorry.

16:38.120 --> 16:43.280
It's just, you know,
you can work so hard
at your job and your life,

16:43.320 --> 16:47.520
and then things outside of
your control just come in and...

16:47.560 --> 16:49.480
pull the rug out.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.360
Yeah, I do know that feeling.

16:53.320 --> 16:57.720
So you do understand why I had
to make the changes I've made.

16:57.760 --> 16:59.840
[grunts]

16:59.880 --> 17:02.080
To a point.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.960
I draw the line at spit-bags,
Ann. I think they're abhorrent.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.440
Yeah, well, when that spit-bag
was shoved over my head, I...

17:09.480 --> 17:11.080
felt helpless.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.960
Same feeling I had

17:14.000 --> 17:15.720
standing outside that
London tube station,

17:15.760 --> 17:18.040
listening to the sirens wailing.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.160
Yeah, look,
I feel like a victim again,
and that's the cruelest blow.

17:25.200 --> 17:29.440
And the worst thing
is that whoever really did this

17:29.480 --> 17:30.840
could go unpunished.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.800
They won't.
We have the right person.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.800
I really wish
I could believe that.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.000
-The top dog told us.
-Allie Novak?

17:45.680 --> 17:47.400
I think we can trust her word.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.680
Thanks, Vera.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.800
[Reb] No, mate.
Well, she-- no.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.400
No, mate.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.760
No, I know
it's a tough spot for you, mate.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.840
She's been in the slot
for a week. That's why she
hasn't paid the guy.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.680
No, I can't, Trav.
I don't have the bank codes.

18:19.720 --> 18:20.800
Unh--

18:20.840 --> 18:22.680
No, mate, only Lou does.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.560
Yep.

18:24.600 --> 18:27.480
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
You'll just have to stall him.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.640
-Okay, bye.
-[phone beeps]

18:56.320 --> 18:58.040
[beeping]

19:02.640 --> 19:04.880
[cell phone ringing]

19:09.960 --> 19:11.160
Hello?

19:13.840 --> 19:15.040
Hello?

19:21.880 --> 19:23.480
[Joan]<i> Who is this?</i>

19:25.040 --> 19:26.680
Joan, is that you?

19:28.040 --> 19:29.280
Joan?

19:32.240 --> 19:33.440
[beep]

19:36.400 --> 19:38.120
[Marie] Kath?

19:39.000 --> 19:40.280
What are you--

19:40.320 --> 19:41.960
I'd put that back if I were you.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.160
Before Reb sees.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.480
Where's the phone?
Where is it?

20:06.520 --> 20:09.800
If you don't give it to me now,
I will have this cell tossed.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.360
It's you.

20:11.400 --> 20:12.600
What?

20:14.240 --> 20:15.520
It's you.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.000
What is me?

20:20.520 --> 20:23.040
Do you know what it's like
to be alone?

20:24.600 --> 20:26.240
Real loneliness?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.880
Not having a connection
with another human being, not...

20:30.920 --> 20:33.040
not knowing
who your friends are,
your family.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.520
It's like...

20:36.480 --> 20:38.480
It feels like floating in space.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.960
Untethered.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.520
Abandoned.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.120
Just surrounded by nothing--

20:45.160 --> 20:47.560
Okay, I don't know
what you're playing at.

20:47.600 --> 20:50.280
Except for a single
point of light.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.680
Just this--this...

20:54.720 --> 20:58.160
gut certainty that there
is something in my life

20:58.200 --> 21:01.600
of value and meaning
that's real.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.360
And it was always there.
It was just--

21:04.400 --> 21:05.760
it was like a, um...

21:08.080 --> 21:10.160
it was like a pulse.

21:12.360 --> 21:14.240
A number.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.920
And I didn't know what it was,
or what it meant or--

21:16.960 --> 21:19.560
I mean, I just--
I just knew...

21:19.600 --> 21:21.760
I just--just knew that
it was really important to me

21:21.800 --> 21:24.720
that this number connected me
to something, to some...

21:27.960 --> 21:29.400
to someone...

21:32.320 --> 21:34.880
who could connect me
to who I am.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.720
And who could...

21:41.640 --> 21:43.640
who could release me from this.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.120
It was you.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.080
Novak.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.840
Can I have a word?

22:16.600 --> 22:20.600
You know Ferguson's whole
amnesia thing is a big ruse.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.320
Yeah, no shit.

22:22.360 --> 22:24.480
Well, Dr. Miller is
of the belief that it is real

22:24.520 --> 22:26.720
and he's going
to testify to that

22:26.760 --> 22:28.240
at her committal hearing
on Friday.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.560
Okay, but it's just a committal.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.680
-It's not a trial.
-Yes, yes, yes.

22:31.720 --> 22:35.000
But if he tells the hearing that
she is suffering from amnesia,

22:35.040 --> 22:36.960
she will use that
at the murder trial

22:37.000 --> 22:39.160
to make the jury
feel sorry for her.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.520
If she acts up a storm,
like the one
that I have just witnessed,

22:42.560 --> 22:44.720
she will win that jury over.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.360
And when she does,

22:46.400 --> 22:49.520
they will drop the charges
for Bea's murder.

22:49.560 --> 22:52.200
-What? They can't--
-Yeah, they can...

22:52.240 --> 22:53.760
and they will.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.520
I need your help to expose
Ferguson to Dr. Miller.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.680
[stammers] How?

22:59.720 --> 23:02.320
I've already thrown
everything at that bitch.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.280
She won't break.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.640
[grunts]

23:10.600 --> 23:13.000
-...when's Lou getting out?
-I don't know.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.760
She won't tell me.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.360
Can I please speak to Reb?

23:25.960 --> 23:27.240
Okay.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.280
You didn't see what happened.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.920
But you know he did it, right?

23:34.440 --> 23:36.920
So you just need
to tell the police
you witnessed it,

23:36.960 --> 23:39.680
and it'll get me off
the murder charges.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.520
You want me to lie?

23:42.560 --> 23:45.280
Isn't that against
my "truth path," Sheila?

23:45.320 --> 23:48.880
Do you think my true path
is to suffer for
what Mendel did?

23:48.920 --> 23:51.600
We both know what he was, Reb.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.600
I know what he did to you.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.400
Don't you ever
fuckin' talk about that.

23:57.440 --> 24:00.400
I would have thought
that you'd want to help me.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.240
After what we shared.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.160
What we sh--

24:04.200 --> 24:06.840
You were a part of my therapy,
Sheila.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.000
You humiliated me.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.920
You made me feel deeply ashamed
of who I was--

24:10.960 --> 24:12.360
Mendel forced me to--

24:12.400 --> 24:13.960
Yeah, and you believed
in what he was doing.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.760
I just wanted to let the light
into your heart--

24:15.800 --> 24:17.360
Yeah, well, fuck the light.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.320
-To help cure you--
-I'm sor-- To cure me?

24:20.360 --> 24:22.920
Of your perverse lesbianism.

24:22.960 --> 24:26.520
-The wicked will not inherit--
-I'm not a fuckin' lesbian!

24:26.560 --> 24:28.440
God, you never got it, Sheila!

24:29.320 --> 24:31.080
I'm a man.

-[TV on]

24:46.880 --> 24:49.160
... all six inches.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.280
Hang on, no.
He says twelve inches.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.480
As if. Check out his pecs.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.760
-What?
-Oi, Judes.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.120
What you reckon?
Definitely on the 'roids, eh?

24:58.160 --> 25:00.480
You know what that shit
does to the love muscle.

25:00.520 --> 25:03.360
[Boomer] What--
To what?

25:03.400 --> 25:04.880
[Ruby] The love muscle.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.000
No. No. It's twelve.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.000
Twelve inches...

25:10.040 --> 25:11.920
of throbbing hot dog.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.520
[Ruby] Yeah all right, whatever.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.160
[Boomer] Oh, yeah!

25:16.200 --> 25:18.240
[chatter continues]

25:24.600 --> 25:27.800
Get your-- No, get your dirty,
crusty feet away from me.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.960
Say it. They're my sexy--
say I got sexy feet!

25:33.200 --> 25:34.480
[Marie] You okay?

25:34.520 --> 25:36.200
Yeah. Yeah.

25:39.240 --> 25:43.680
I was thinking that you should
go back and see Dr. Miller.

25:46.560 --> 25:49.600
And you said yourself,
it wasn't his fault.

25:49.640 --> 25:52.960
No, I'm all good. Thanks.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.120
You have to get him to sign
off on that surgery, Reb--

25:56.160 --> 25:57.960
Lou said she would sort it.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.440
When Lou gets out of the slot,

26:01.480 --> 26:04.000
she's gonna
take a crack at him.

26:04.040 --> 26:05.720
Is that what you want?

26:05.760 --> 26:07.160
What are you talking about?

26:07.200 --> 26:11.480
Her way of sorting Miller...

26:11.520 --> 26:14.040
is to get rid of him,
any way she can.

26:14.080 --> 26:17.960
-That's bullshit.
-Do you want that on
your conscience, Reb?

26:21.520 --> 26:24.160
You know, my boy, Danny...

26:24.200 --> 26:28.840
he went down that violent path
and it cost him everything.

26:28.880 --> 26:31.240
I don't want the same for you.

26:33.600 --> 26:36.680
I'm not gonna let that happen.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.920
-[Judy] I can't go there!
-[Ruby] Whoa whoa whoa.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.760
-You can't fucking make me!
-No one's trying to make
you do anything.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.400
-I can't, I can't!
-No, you're staying here,
with us.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.960
-What's going on?
-I don't know,

26:46.000 --> 26:47.080
she just started carrying on.

26:47.120 --> 26:48.360
I can't go there!

26:48.400 --> 26:50.760
Why is my Dad
making me go there?!

26:50.800 --> 26:52.960
Hey, hey, hey, come on,
look at me. Look at me.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.280
Fuck, what have you taken?

26:54.320 --> 26:55.840
-What do you mean?
-What's she taken?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.360
-I don't bloody know.
-Oh, fuck,

26:57.400 --> 26:58.800
something's wrong
with me, isn't it?

26:58.840 --> 27:00.360
No, no, no, no.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.200
Come on, let's get her
into her cell.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.240
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
Have you taken ice?

27:04.280 --> 27:05.760
-What?
-Have you taken ice?

27:05.800 --> 27:07.760
No, no, just a little acid,
that's all,

27:07.800 --> 27:09.600
just to take the edge off.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.280
Why are you looking at me
like that?

27:11.320 --> 27:12.800
Stop looking at me like that!

27:12.840 --> 27:15.080
I'm--I'm not looking at you
like nothing!

27:15.120 --> 27:17.520
Okay, don't crowd her.
Just give her some space.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.640
-Judy--
-Aw, fuck.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.480
Judy, it's okay.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.440
It's okay, you're safe.
Nothing to worry about.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.760
Just look at me.
Look at my face.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.600
-Who the fuck are you?
-I'm Sheila.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.800
-Did my father send you?
-No, sweetheart.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.040
You're just having a bad trip,
that's all.

27:32.080 --> 27:35.080
It's just the acid.
It's messing with your mind,

27:35.120 --> 27:37.320
-okay?
-Yeah, okay.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.960
So what I need, I need you to
focus on your thoughts, okay?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.760
Just acknowledge
any bad thoughts

27:42.800 --> 27:45.360
and just let them go,
because it's not real.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.840
-It's not real.
-Yeah, it's not real.

27:47.880 --> 27:50.280
-He wants me to die.
-No, no,

27:50.320 --> 27:52.480
you're surrounded by
people who love you,

27:52.520 --> 27:54.080
who only want the best for you.

27:54.120 --> 27:56.440
I just need you to concentrate
on your thoughts--

27:56.480 --> 28:00.000
that's it, yes?--
and just let them go.

28:00.040 --> 28:02.960
Just let your thoughts
just come and go.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
It's not real.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.400
[Judy's breathing slows]

28:06.440 --> 28:09.840
-It's not real.
-[Judy gasps]

28:09.880 --> 28:12.960
That's good.
That's really good.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.360
So, Judy, how about
we lie down now?

28:15.400 --> 28:18.400
You wanna do that?
Let's lie down. Okay.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.080
[whispers] She'll be all right.
I'll stay with her.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.480
[Judy] I'm afraid.

28:24.520 --> 28:28.160
Shh. Shh. It's all right.
It's all good.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.560
You're safe.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.880
You're safe.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.200
You're safe.

28:41.200 --> 28:42.840
You're safe.

28:44.040 --> 28:47.080
-I'm happy to watch her.
-Thanks.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.280
You've done this before.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.680
Don't look at me like that, Dad.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.920
-Shh, shh, shh.
-I'll be a good girl.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.280
You are a good girl.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.920
Hmm? And you're safe.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.880
It's a bit like a truth serum.

29:02.920 --> 29:06.560
With LSD,
whatever you're suppressing,
it always bubbles up.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.360
Good girl.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.440
I know how to break
Ferguson's act.

29:26.480 --> 29:29.000
-What?
-But I'm gonna need you
to pull her shadow.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.520
Yeah, I can organize that but--

29:30.560 --> 29:33.360
I'm also going to need
some way of recording her.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.000
[Zheng]
Okay, girls, time to eat.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.680
You want a cup of tea, Kath?

30:26.720 --> 30:28.920
[Joan/Kath]
That would be lovely, thank you.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.280
-Uh, Zheng?
-Hmm.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.760
Can I grab some coffee, please,
for our unit? We're low.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.400
Great, thank you.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.040
Okay, thank you.

31:08.440 --> 31:11.480
-Aren't you having one?
-Nah.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.200
Well, I...
I wouldn't have-- Thank you.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.000
It's okay.
You deserve it.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.200
Oh, God.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.160
Keane. Appointment
with Dr. Miller.
Let's go.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.640
I'm really glad you decided
to come back.

31:49.680 --> 31:51.440
Yeah, I didn't have much choice,
so...

31:51.480 --> 31:54.880
-What happened last time--
-Wasn't your fault.

31:54.920 --> 31:56.680
I have some, um...

31:58.840 --> 32:02.680
issues when it
comes to therapists.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.720
Well, you wouldn't be the first.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.160
[laughs softly]

32:06.200 --> 32:08.800
Can you tell me more about that?

32:12.800 --> 32:14.640
I'll tell you what. Um...

32:14.680 --> 32:17.640
why don't we try something,
yeah?

32:17.680 --> 32:20.800
Do you know what a mind map is?

32:20.840 --> 32:24.400
Okay. So I'm going
to write the word
"therapist" here,

32:24.440 --> 32:27.840
and I just want you
to free-associate.

32:27.880 --> 32:29.840
Single words are fine.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.240
Just whatever comes
into your head,

32:31.280 --> 32:34.640
I want you to
say it out loud, yeah?

32:38.360 --> 32:40.320
Any word.
There's no right or wrong,

32:40.360 --> 32:42.920
just whatever
comes into your head.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.920
-Cult.
-Okay, good.

32:46.960 --> 32:48.840

32:48.880 --> 32:50.920

No, no, no!

33:36.040 --> 33:38.000
Please! No!

33:38.040 --> 33:40.040
Reb, are you okay?

33:40.080 --> 33:42.240
[panting]

34:10.720 --> 34:14.200
[distorted ambient sounds]

34:20.240 --> 34:21.440
[Allie] Hey.

34:24.360 --> 34:25.560
You all right?

34:26.520 --> 34:28.480
Come with me.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.120
Let's get you back to your unit.

34:30.160 --> 34:32.240
Okay? That's it.

34:32.280 --> 34:36.240
Why don't we, um,
get you to sit...right here.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.640
That's good. Yeah.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.280

<i>That's good. That's good.</i>

34:44.000 --> 34:47.240
<i>[distorted sounds]</i>

34:49.160 --> 34:50.440
I feel very odd.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.600
Why are you being so nice to me?
I thought you hated me.

34:56.640 --> 34:59.040
[audio distorted]
I was wrong about you.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.200
I can see that you've changed.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.600
[inmates chattering]

35:13.720 --> 35:14.920
[beep]

35:20.160 --> 35:23.320
Oh! [laughs]

35:23.360 --> 35:25.520
What's this for, hey?

35:25.560 --> 35:29.000
Oh, I take it things went well
with Dr. Miller, then?

35:29.040 --> 35:31.640
Yeah.
Thank you.

35:32.520 --> 35:34.040
My pleasure.

35:45.080 --> 35:47.240
I'll help you.

35:49.640 --> 35:52.880
I'll tell the police
I saw Mendel make everyone
drink the poison.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.360
On one condition.

35:55.400 --> 35:58.640
You don't ever tell anyone
about what he did to me.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.240
I don't want Lou knowing.

36:03.280 --> 36:06.480
I don't want that to affect
how she feels about me.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.960
Of course.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.560
Thank you.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.240
[breathing heavily]

36:21.280 --> 36:23.040
You don't look so good.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.440
I think...

36:25.480 --> 36:27.280
I think I'm coming down
with something.

36:27.320 --> 36:29.840
-Holy shit!
-What?

36:31.520 --> 36:34.200
-What's happening to your face?
-What do you mean?

Your face, it's...

You're not Kath.

36:44.560 --> 36:45.880
I-I am.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.960
I think you know
who you really are.

-I don't!
-Come on, Joan.

36:50.280 --> 36:53.520
-Nothing is making sense.
-No, I know it doesn't
make any sense,

36:53.560 --> 36:54.800
but it--it will.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.760
It will if you just...tell me.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.800
Come on, just tell me
who you really are.

36:58.840 --> 37:01.200
Tell me who you really are.

-[Joan/Kath] I don't understand.

Blood!

Where? Where?

On my hand!
On my hand!

Whose blood is it, Joan?
Is it Bea's blood?

Is it--

-It's the girl.

-It's not Kath!
-I'm Kath. I'm Kath.

38:11.160 --> 38:12.920
-No, you're not Kath.
-I'm Kath!

38:12.960 --> 38:15.640
You are Joan Ferguson.
You're Joan fucking Ferguson!

39:30.800 --> 39:32.920
-[slicing]
-Ohh!

39:36.600 --> 39:38.440
I'm sorry.

39:39.480 --> 39:43.040
I'm so, so sorry. I didn't...

I...

39:51.680 --> 39:53.800
[panting]

39:53.840 --> 39:55.640
I killed her.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.680
I am so sorry.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.800
I killed her.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.280
I killed her!

Kath.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.560
It's okay.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.120
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.280
We just need you to be calm,
okay?

40:17.320 --> 40:20.040
I killed her.

40:20.080 --> 40:22.800
So I want you
to come with me to Medical.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.040
We'll have you checked out,
okay?

40:25.080 --> 40:27.760
It's gonna make you feel
so much better, I promise.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.040
Will you come with me?

40:33.000 --> 40:34.200
Kath?

-Shit!
-Fucking hell.

Shit!

40:59.240 --> 41:00.960
On your feet, Kelly.

41:04.520 --> 41:05.920
Give us a second.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.440
I spoke to the police.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.720
I expressed my doubts
that you assaulted me.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.920
They're reconsidering
the charges.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.640
You're welcome.

41:21.120 --> 41:23.120
Also gets you out of here.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.840
Governor's order.

41:24.880 --> 41:28.640
Just so you know...

41:28.680 --> 41:31.920
it was Novak who lagged on you.

41:31.960 --> 41:36.000
I figure either she bashed me,
or she's protecting who did.

41:37.880 --> 41:41.800
And it's not my business, but...

41:41.840 --> 41:44.120
I'd use all my authority
to protect you

41:44.160 --> 41:47.080
if you decided
to take it personally.

41:58.440 --> 42:00.160
[breathing heavily]

42:00.200 --> 42:02.240
Hey, Kath, how're you feelin'?

42:02.280 --> 42:03.480
The girl.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.480
The girl, I keep seeing her.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.760
And she...

42:08.800 --> 42:11.960
she looks at me with such...

42:12.000 --> 42:13.360
accusation.

42:13.400 --> 42:16.560
-Kath--
-Joan Ferguson murdered her.

42:16.600 --> 42:19.040
I-- I think she--
I think she stabbed--

42:19.080 --> 42:22.600
she stabbed-she stabbed her
with...a shard of glass.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.160
Kath, listen to me.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.880
We got the results
of the blood tests back.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.600
You have LSD in your system,
okay?

42:27.640 --> 42:29.600
It's causing hallucinations.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.960
Nothing you're
experiencing right now
can be trusted. Okay?

42:34.680 --> 42:36.240
-What's that?
-It's okay.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.440
-What is that?
-It's okay, Kath.

42:37.480 --> 42:38.760
It's just to help you sleep.

42:41.520 --> 42:43.680
Please... [grunts]

42:46.000 --> 42:48.280
Why were there no guards
with her?

42:48.320 --> 42:50.080
I removed them.

42:50.120 --> 42:51.600
Shit, Vera!

42:51.640 --> 42:53.760
The nanny cam?
Seriously?

42:53.800 --> 42:55.520
How many times
do we have to go through this?

42:55.560 --> 42:58.080
Exposing Ferguson only risks
exposing us.

43:00.200 --> 43:02.560
Okay, she should be asleep
for hours.

43:02.600 --> 43:05.040
So you heard what
she screamed in the corridor.

43:05.080 --> 43:06.000
"I killed her.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.960
<i>I</i> killed her."

43:08.000 --> 43:09.760
That is as good as a confession.

43:09.800 --> 43:11.320
To what?

43:11.360 --> 43:13.840
[sighs] To the murder
of Kath Maxwell.

43:13.880 --> 43:16.360
I don't think she was
talking about Kath Maxwell.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.000
Besides, her blood
has high levels of LSD.

43:19.040 --> 43:21.560
Somebody's obviously
slipped it to her.

43:21.600 --> 43:25.080
Look, whatever she said
or did under its influence,

43:25.120 --> 43:26.480
it's meaningless.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.280
[door buzzes, opens, closes]

43:41.360 --> 43:43.240
-[door buzzes]
-Linda!

43:43.280 --> 43:45.920
I'm about to do
the incident report.

43:45.960 --> 43:49.080
When you're done, finish up
and hand your pass in
at the gate.

43:49.120 --> 43:52.360
-What?
-There was no need for you
to assault the prisoner.

43:52.400 --> 43:55.720
Your three strikes are up.
You're suspended.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.920
[PA system]<i> Attention compound,</i>

44:04.880 --> 44:06.960
Oh, my God! [laughing]

44:07.000 --> 44:08.920
-Oh!
-[kissing]

44:17.040 --> 44:18.520
Hey, guess what?

44:18.560 --> 44:22.480
Um...you're not gonna
believe this.

44:22.520 --> 44:24.000
What?

44:24.040 --> 44:25.760
Sheila's here.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.720
You remember the news report
on the telly?

44:30.760 --> 44:32.560
It was her.

44:32.600 --> 44:34.080
She stole the clinic's money.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.240
-Sheila's here?
-Yeah.

44:37.600 --> 44:40.040
Cops reckon she helped Mendel
poison everyone.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.760
She's been charged with murder.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.880
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay,
'cause I told her

44:44.920 --> 44:47.200
I'd just tell the police
that she wasn't even there.

44:47.240 --> 44:49.200
What?
No, Reb, you can't--

44:49.240 --> 44:51.640
[stammers]
Nine people were killed.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.320
All the records were burnt.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.360
The police don't even know
we were there.

44:55.400 --> 44:57.320
You cannot get us
mixed up in that shit.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.840
But she didn't do anything.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.200
-You can't do it.
-Well, I have to, Lou.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.200
Look, I know Sheila
did some awful stuff,

45:03.240 --> 45:05.320
but she was just as much of
a victim of Mendel as we were.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.840
No, she wasn't.

45:11.920 --> 45:15.480
She used...to drug some
of the girls with Rohypnol

45:15.520 --> 45:17.040
so Mendel could rape them.

45:19.680 --> 45:23.000
Sheila's no victim.
She is a fuckin' monster.

45:38.880 --> 45:40.920
Lou.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.360
Oh, it's so good to see you.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.840
Cut the crap, Sheila.

45:44.880 --> 45:47.680
I am the last fuckin' face
you wanna see.

45:47.720 --> 45:50.440
If you think that Reb
is gonna bail you out,

45:50.480 --> 45:53.160
you're even fuckin' crazier
than I remember.

45:55.440 --> 45:57.320
So you're still controlling her?

45:59.560 --> 46:02.520
Him. And he made
the decision himself

46:02.560 --> 46:05.040
after I told him
what you really are.

46:05.080 --> 46:07.680
And what about you, Lou?

46:07.720 --> 46:10.600
Have you told Reb the truth
about you?

46:15.400 --> 46:16.760
[Boomer]
Shit!

46:16.800 --> 46:18.400
Oh, shit, shit!

46:18.440 --> 46:20.680
Aw, shit! Aw, shit!

46:20.720 --> 46:23.200
What's going on?
Don't tell me you've
dropped acid too.

46:23.240 --> 46:26.600
No, no, she's just freakin' out
'cause Gavin's coming
to visit tomorrow.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.720
-Well, isn't that good?
-No, it's not good, no,

46:28.760 --> 46:30.400
'cause he thinks
that I look like you,

46:30.440 --> 46:33.040
like I've got your boobs
and your arse and--

46:33.080 --> 46:36.400
like all this is all<i> that,</i>
and it's not.

46:36.440 --> 46:38.600
Yeah, but he's into
your sexy voice.

46:38.640 --> 46:40.480
Coming out of her sexy mouth.

46:40.520 --> 46:43.720
-What are you talking about?
-I'm-- Oh, fuck it!

46:43.760 --> 46:47.280
Boomer, it won't matter
when he sees you and talks
to you in person.

46:47.320 --> 46:48.880
[laughing]

46:48.920 --> 46:50.000
What?

46:50.040 --> 46:51.920
You're gonna give up hot-as-fuck

46:51.960 --> 46:53.600
and not give it a chance?

46:53.640 --> 46:55.840
I mean, think about the abs.

46:55.880 --> 46:59.480
Well, what if he, like, takes
one look at me and just bolts?

46:59.520 --> 47:01.840
If he does, he's an idiot.

47:03.040 --> 47:04.560
He won't.

47:04.600 --> 47:07.200
Besides, we're gonna do
your hair and makeup.

47:07.240 --> 47:10.000
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
look like such a spunk.

47:10.040 --> 47:12.640
Can you please make me
look like Allie?

47:12.680 --> 47:14.600
I'm not a bloody miracle worker.

47:14.640 --> 47:16.040
You little shit!

47:17.160 --> 47:19.000
[gasps]

47:19.040 --> 47:21.240
You're fucked!
You're fuckin' dead,
you little fuck!

47:21.280 --> 47:24.560
-Ohh!
-That won't stop me!

47:24.600 --> 47:25.960
Keep running!

48:31.360 --> 48:33.400
I love you, Mummy.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.880
[Reb]<i> I can't believe</i>

48:46.920 --> 48:48.560
it's finally gonna happen.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.920
[Lou laughs softly]

48:50.960 --> 48:53.520
-I owe it all to you, babe.
-Mm.

48:53.560 --> 48:55.240
No, really.

49:03.360 --> 49:04.600
I love you.

49:09.440 --> 49:11.200
<i>No!</i>

49:17.920 --> 49:20.960
<i>No! No!</i>

49:21.000 --> 49:23.320

49:23.360 --> 49:25.160
<i>No!</i>

49:26.120 --> 49:28.480
<i>No!</i>

49:30.880 --> 49:33.000
<i>No!</i>

49:36.760 --> 49:39.320
Baby, there's something
I need to tell you.

49:47.120 --> 49:49.880
Reynolds told me it was
Novak who lagged.

49:52.200 --> 49:54.000
We're gonna take the bitch down.
