<i>Take a look around you right now.</i>

00:03.680 --> 00:06.559
<i>There's one thing everyone
who's come out here tonight has in common.</i>

00:07.320 --> 00:08.356
<i>Defiance.</i>

00:09.200 --> 00:10.200
<i>But it's more than that.</i>

00:11.320 --> 00:12.959
<i>You didn't just opt out</i>

00:13.400 --> 00:15.710
<i>of the creatures and the curfew</i>

00:16.400 --> 00:18.790
<i>of the rules and restrictions
that come with it.</i>

00:19.480 --> 00:21.551
<i>No, you went further than that.</i>

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
<i>You opted in.</i>

00:24.040 --> 00:25.759
<i>Now, nothing about the race is easy.</i>

00:25.840 --> 00:27.752
<i>But it is going to be worth it.</i>

00:28.600 --> 00:31.832
<i>Cos at the end of tonight,
one team is gonna come with me</i>

00:31.880 --> 00:36.557
<i>to a place where you can sit out at night
and gaze up at the stars.</i>

00:37.960 --> 00:39.394
<i>A place without creatures.</i>

00:40.640 --> 00:41.756
<i>A place with hope.</i>

00:43.080 --> 00:44.116
<i>Good luck, people.</i>

You've lost a lot of blood
but you'll start to stabilise

02:42.800 --> 02:44.320
as soon as I can control the bleeding.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.400
But you need to stay calm.

02:46.840 --> 02:47.840
Where's the entry wound?

02:47.880 --> 02:49.951
The bullet has gone into your upper abdomen

02:50.080 --> 02:51.800
and it looks like it went straight through.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.190
Just stay with me, Professor Underhill.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.516
I admire your bedside manner, Doctor Newman

02:56.560 --> 02:59.075
but I think it might be wasted on me.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.679
I have a fairly good understanding
of my prognosis.

03:04.040 --> 03:09.354
You're a brilliant scientist, professor.
You know how resilient the human body is.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.516
I need you, Kaye.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.990
I need you to pick up the baton.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.354
Any hope of a cure is in your hands now.

03:54.200 --> 03:59.116
Ziggy was almost completely paralysed
without any movement or sensation

03:59.160 --> 04:00.594
in his legs or his tail.

04:01.800 --> 04:05.510
Six weeks ago, the chances of his
ever walking again were zero.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.957
We took glial cells from his brain,
combined them with the viral vector

04:12.760 --> 04:17.277
injected them into his spine
and the results were remarkable.

04:22.120 --> 04:26.194
Ziggy is now fully ambulatory,
paralysis is completely reversed

04:26.800 --> 04:31.716
and, in fact, this morning he was literally
swinging from the chandeliers.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.795
You must both be incredibly proud
of your mother.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.749
Totally. Mum rocks.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.875
Big day for you too, Peter.
You must be pretty excited.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.276
I am, yes. Very excited.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.676
Er, how's the world of neuroscience?

04:55.800 --> 04:59.271
Oh, you know, my supplementary motor area's
still trying to make brainwaves.

05:01.400 --> 05:05.679
Um... You're, you're so funny
when you talk about your work.

05:05.880 --> 05:06.711
Ha!

05:06.840 --> 05:09.674
Uh, Have you thought any more
about your mother's offer?

05:10.160 --> 05:11.674
We'd both love to have you

05:12.520 --> 05:14.671
er, er join the team.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.917
Er, yeah. It's an amazing offer.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.760
I'm just trying to see if I can juggle it
with my other commitments.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.593
Was I alright?

05:21.840 --> 05:24.674
- Yeah, you killed it!
- You and the monkey kicked ass.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.953
Oh, I'm not normally nervous but I must admit
my stomach was doing somersaults up there.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.954
Do you remember that time
you were giving your graduate presentation

05:33.000 --> 05:34.480
on fibril formation?

05:34.720 --> 05:35.995
You completely froze.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.576
Kaye loves it when you tell this story.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.751
When she did speak,
it was complete gibberish.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.553
I think of that sometimes

05:41.600 --> 05:45.150
just to steady my nerves cos at least I know
it will never be that bad.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.350
I'm sorry to interrupt.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.596
I just wanted to say well done
on the presentation.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.677
Thank you. This is Sebastian Underhill.

05:52.720 --> 05:56.714
He works for Brookeheath Pharmaceutical.
- Yes, we've recently, er, invested

05:56.760 --> 05:59.514
in taking your mother's amazing work
to the next level

06:00.480 --> 06:01.550
human trials.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.235
Which means that I unfortunately
have to take her away

06:05.280 --> 06:06.839
and introduce you to a few people.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.156
Back in a minute.

06:09.680 --> 06:10.680
Ugh...

06:11.840 --> 06:12.840
Every time.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.238
I don't think I can work for Mum.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.872
She bosses me around too much as it is.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.496
Do you remember that time
I tried to cook Christmas dinner?

06:22.520 --> 06:23.795
She printed me a timetable.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.519
She won't take no for an answer.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.554
When there's something she wants,
she's like a machine.

06:29.400 --> 06:30.754
That why you moved to Cornwall?

06:31.880 --> 06:32.880
That and the waves.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.592
I was thinking about getting this thing
fixed up and taking it back with me.

06:39.320 --> 06:40.720
She'll get rid of it if I don't.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.516
She can't, it's Dad's car.
- That won't stop her. Nothing ever does.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.719
Not when she gets an idea in her head.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.994
We have to save Dad's car.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.120
Let's do it.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.456
If we drive through the night,
we'll be there by morning.

06:55.800 --> 06:56.800
Yeah!

07:07.760 --> 07:09.911
I was seriously up for that.
- Yeah, me too.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.696
I don't understand
what there is to think about.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.394
This kind of opportunity
doesn't come round very often.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.358
Most people would bite their right arm off.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.681
Well, most people
wouldn't have to report to their mother.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.472
Of course, you don't need to work for me.
You could do anything you wanted to.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.955
Dad always used to say.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.551
The truth is, Kaye, I need you.

07:37.200 --> 07:42.150
This study has the potential to have
an enormous impact on the whole world.

07:43.840 --> 07:44.990
Take as long as you need.

07:48.840 --> 07:49.840
Bye, darling.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Bye.
- Bye.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.200
Give me a call soon.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.280
Yeah. I will.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.478
The whole place gives me the creeps.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.400
What? I'm only saying what you're thinking.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.191
Mum's on the verge
of a major breakthrough.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.677
Yeah, so was Dr Frankenstein.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.238
His blood pressure's 360 over 190.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.756
Let's run a full set of diagnostics.

08:35.360 --> 08:36.960
Let me know when you've got hold of him.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
Oh, nasty...

08:50.240 --> 08:52.896
<i>I just think you need
to put things in perspective, Helen.</i>

08:52.920 --> 08:56.311
Yes, well, you didn't see how aggressive
that monkey was before he died.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.717
<i>These kind of accidents are bound to happen.</i>

08:58.800 --> 09:00.176
<i>It would be a massive over-reaction</i>

09:00.200 --> 09:02.510
to suspend the trials
at such a critical stage.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.677
You're on the verge of something
really remarkable here, Helen.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.598
<i>You just need to hold your nerve.</i>

09:11.600 --> 09:16.356
<i>We stick to the original timetable
and go to full human trials.</i>

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
OK.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.789
You did everything you could.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.189
Didn't make any difference.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.360
Couldn't save him.

09:53.920 --> 09:55.195
I can't save anyone.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.120
You can though.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.240
Kaye, Underhill figured it out.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.831
You can finish off
what him and your mum started.

10:01.920 --> 10:04.799
If we go back to Kiloran,
we can find the cure.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.355
No, I can't go back there.
- Yes, you can.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.120
Kaye, the whole time I've known you,
you've never let anything stand in your way.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.554
You don't know what happened.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.280
So tell me.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.473
You're still there, aren't you?

10:21.800 --> 10:24.190
Make yourself cosy, you're going nowhere.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.155
What's that? Speak up.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.120
I can't hear you.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.714
It's your fault.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.958
Oh well, that's rich, coming from you.

10:39.040 --> 10:43.114
You single-handedly wiped out
a tenth of the world's population.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.959
It's my cross to bear.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.719
Too fucking right it is.

10:47.880 --> 10:51.351
My daughter lives... with a terrible burden.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.320
But you...

10:55.720 --> 10:57.552
you played your part.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.197
That's a matter of opinion.

11:01.120 --> 11:05.319
You... deserve to die.

11:05.760 --> 11:06.760
Yeah, well.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.874
You know how the song goes.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.315
You can't always get...

11:15.760 --> 11:16.910
what you want...

11:39.040 --> 11:40.040
Are you alright?

11:40.720 --> 11:42.439
Yeah, I'm fine, sorry.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.639
You really alright? You seem a bit...

11:53.200 --> 11:54.475
Oh, I'm so terribly sorry.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.911
It's these beastly nosebleeds.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.118
I've suffered from them since I was a child.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.240
Excuse me.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.954
I knew you'd be back.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.674
You've made the right decision.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.600
Hi.

12:56.440 --> 13:00.036
His name's Michael Garwick. He's a T-Nine.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.558
He was in a car accident three weeks ago.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.714
Practically no scar tissue.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.954
<i>He's young. He was in perfect health.</i>

13:08.000 --> 13:10.913
As far as we know.
Don't we need a psychological profile?

13:11.560 --> 13:12.960
We're not here to judge him, Kaye.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.080
We're here to help him walk again.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.912
Welcome to Kiloran Medical Facility,
Mr Garwick.

13:23.560 --> 13:24.880
Hope your journey was OK.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.400
Well, I've had worse.

13:29.720 --> 13:30.720
What's the food like?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.633
<i>You wanna know how I feel?</i>

13:53.800 --> 13:54.800
<i>Like my life's over.</i>

13:58.800 --> 14:00.160
Do you think I'm gonna walk again?

14:00.560 --> 14:03.871
You wouldn't have been offered a place
on this trial if there wasn't a chance.

14:36.960 --> 14:37.960
<i>Occupation?</i>

14:38.120 --> 14:39.120
Driver.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.312
Family history?
- The usual.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.674
Are your parents still alive?

14:45.720 --> 14:46.915
As far as I'm aware.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.440
Do you live by yourself?

14:49.920 --> 14:51.149
Except when I have company.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.520
What's with all the questions?
I've already consented to your trial.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.109
You've been through a lot.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.837
I just want to make sure you're otherwise
fit and well, physically and mentally.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.560
How do you feel about your accident?

15:02.600 --> 15:05.354
Angry? Depressed? Frightened?

15:11.360 --> 15:13.238
OK, I can see you're not in the mood.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.600
We'll just...

15:15.560 --> 15:16.710
we'll do it another time.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.240
I had it coming.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.116
You think your injuries
are some form of punishment?

15:39.880 --> 15:41.030
No one else was hurt.

15:42.080 --> 15:46.279
You may have been driving too fast
but it could've been much worse.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.800
Most of the patients on this trial
were in car accidents.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.480
Nah.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.155
See, I love cars.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.436
When you're driving...

16:01.240 --> 16:02.720
and you've got a good tune on

16:04.400 --> 16:05.675
it's just you and the road.

16:06.160 --> 16:07.719
It's like you're flying or something.

16:11.520 --> 16:13.273
Honestly, there's no better feeling.

16:14.680 --> 16:15.830
I actually can't drive.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.876
Seriously?
- I failed my driving test.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.760
It's the only test I've ever failed.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.359
Yeah, we're gonna have to rectify this.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.395
Is he prepped and consented
for tomorrow's surgery?

17:40.120 --> 17:41.320
Do you really think it's safe?

17:43.560 --> 17:44.560
Yes.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.869
You like him, don't you?

17:53.360 --> 17:56.478
I think he's stubborn, reckless
and ambivalent about his future.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.919
Don't let personal feelings
cloud your judgement, Kaye.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.000
I need you with a clear head.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.080
Oh!

20:06.200 --> 20:07.200
<i>Peter.</i>

20:07.480 --> 20:08.311
<i>How are you?</i>

20:08.400 --> 20:10.676
Much better recently, thank you for...

20:11.680 --> 20:12.511
er, for asking.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.632
It's just these ghastly migraines.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.800
Mum said you still don't know
what's causing them.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.515
Are they getting worse?

20:19.920 --> 20:22.037
They... tend to lift in the evenings.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.080
But I've been, er...

20:26.120 --> 20:29.511
...rather struggling in the daytime,
to be honest.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.590
Did you ever get a chance
to take a look at the, er...

20:38.240 --> 20:41.153
pathogenic virus that the viral vector
was based on?

20:42.040 --> 20:43.040
Of course.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.834
The modifications were remarkable

20:44.880 --> 20:46.336
especially what you did
with the helper virus.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.795
You realise in order to do that, we had to...

20:49.880 --> 20:53.840
leave certain elements
of the viral genome intact.

20:54.920 --> 20:55.920
But...

20:56.000 --> 20:59.357
that would make it capable
of uncontrolled replication.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.636
Did you ever ask your mother
about what happened to Ziggy?

21:04.640 --> 21:06.677
Ziggy's death had nothing to do
with the treatment.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.199
What aren't you telling me, Peter?

21:10.280 --> 21:11.800
You should really talk to your mother.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.480
Ah, Kaye. Sit down.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.630
Got lots to discuss.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.069
Peter's symptoms...

21:21.920 --> 21:23.960
they're the same as the other patients,
aren't they?

21:24.680 --> 21:28.037
I'm seeing hyper-sensitivity to light.
Chronic fatigue.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.196
Chest infections.

21:29.560 --> 21:30.676
How did they get sick?

21:33.840 --> 21:36.480
Peter told me
that the viral vector wasn't stable.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.479
If there is even a possibility
that this is contagious

21:39.720 --> 21:41.757
we have to shut the trials down now.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.320
No, you need to tell me what happened.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.159
I'll help you, Mum. I promise.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.711
I don't need your help - what I need
is more time to continue with the trials.

21:48.760 --> 21:49.796
Is Michael in danger?

21:51.200 --> 21:52.953
Oh, is that what this is about?

21:53.520 --> 21:56.160
You're not here
to indulge in some petty romance.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.593
You're losing your focus, Kaye.

21:58.840 --> 22:02.470
You are so focused on your work,
you can't see anything else.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.189
Ruby and I spent our entire lives
trying to get your attention

22:06.240 --> 22:08.709
and even when Dad got sick,
you just ignored him

22:08.760 --> 22:10.399
because nothing else can get in the way.

22:10.520 --> 22:13.718
Your patients might be dying.
You have to stop.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.389
You need to listen to me!

22:15.640 --> 22:17.996
God, I fought so hard
to get to where I am today.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.920
And I knew it wouldn't be easy.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.917
Punish the successful woman because
God forbid she should be brilliant at her job

22:23.960 --> 22:24.996
and a good mother.

22:25.240 --> 22:29.632
Everybody warned me,
but I fought that fight for you.

22:30.040 --> 22:32.509
For my daughters. For a different future.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.656
And the one thing they didn't tell me
was that in the end

22:35.680 --> 22:37.319
it's your daughters who'll turn on you.

23:01.720 --> 23:04.189
Yeah, we really need
to work on your clutch control.

23:05.680 --> 23:08.070
Just get in the car.
- You didn't tell me where we're going.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
Do you trust me?

23:11.640 --> 23:12.640
With my life.

23:12.960 --> 23:13.960
Just get in the car.

23:20.120 --> 23:21.156
On one condition.

23:22.920 --> 23:23.920
I'm driving.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.360
I should have told you then.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.234
I knew that something was wrong.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.976
You might've had your suspicions,
but you didn't know for sure.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
I knew.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.272
I was just too scared
to do anything about it.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.518
Peter's are the most advanced.

23:50.080 --> 23:54.871
But almost all the other patients
are now presenting the same symptoms.

23:56.880 --> 24:00.715
Look, I cannot control
the situation any longer.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.877
<i>No, I'm very glad you called me, Helen.</i>

24:07.320 --> 24:08.674
It was the right thing to do.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.079
<i>I'm sending a specialist team.</i>

24:11.400 --> 24:12.754
<i>They'll take care of everything.</i>

24:37.320 --> 24:39.152
Kaye! What are you doing here?

24:40.920 --> 24:41.920
Ah...

24:43.560 --> 24:44.560
This is Michael.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.511
How's it going?

24:46.680 --> 24:48.160
It's going good, thank you.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.595
D'you remember what happened
to Mr Proops?

24:55.120 --> 24:57.157
That was the name of our cat,
when we were kids.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.552
Mr Proops? Whose idea was that?

25:01.160 --> 25:03.914
Mine. Kaye wanted to call him Fluffy.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.314
He was really fluffy.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.116
Anyway, Mum hated him.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.678
After Dad died,
she said that Mr Proops got hit by a car.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.636
Turns out, she'd had him put down.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.029
Acute kidney failure.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.390
She just didn't want the cat
pissing all over the house.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.793
My point is, she lied to us.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.336
And now she's blatantly doing it again.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.431
You don't know that for sure.

25:24.480 --> 25:27.056
If you didn't think there was something wrong
we wouldn't be here, right?

25:27.080 --> 25:28.116
Exactly.

25:28.840 --> 25:31.196
You're better off without her, Kaye.
We all are.

25:31.960 --> 25:32.960
Mr Proops.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.315
Mr Proops.
- Mr Proops.

25:42.640 --> 25:44.472
<i>Hello, this is Professor Newman.</i>

25:44.520 --> 25:46.079
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

25:46.680 --> 25:48.558
Mum, it's me again.

25:50.520 --> 25:54.594
I'm really sorry for what I said
but I'm worried, can you please call me back?

25:55.800 --> 25:57.473
Even if it's just to tell me you're OK.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.960
Everyone needs to stay calm.

26:52.640 --> 26:54.552
- Can you tell us anything?
- Alright.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.240
Follow me.

26:59.880 --> 27:00.880
What's happening?

27:01.040 --> 27:02.040
Who is doing this?

27:02.920 --> 27:04.559
Just...

27:05.640 --> 27:06.790
Put your weapons down.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.952
Somebody kindly tell me
what the hell's going on?

27:10.000 --> 27:11.320
You wanna know what's going on?

27:11.760 --> 27:12.989
You lot are going nowhere.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.000
So pull up a chair and make yourselves cosy.

28:40.040 --> 28:41.040
Mum!

29:45.680 --> 29:46.680
Hello?

30:01.720 --> 30:02.720
Mum?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.240
Hello?

30:47.520 --> 30:48.520
Hello?

30:56.520 --> 30:58.716
Come in! Can anybody hear me?
Is anybody there?

31:02.960 --> 31:03.960
<i>Is it safe?</i>

31:04.880 --> 31:05.880
Who is this?

31:06.080 --> 31:08.920
Where are you? I'm in the ward,
I think that we need to get out of here.

31:09.840 --> 31:10.956
<i>Is it safe?</i>

31:11.280 --> 31:12.839
<i>Tell me.</i>

31:23.120 --> 31:24.120
<i>Who are you?</i>

31:24.280 --> 31:25.280
<i>Who's with you?</i>

31:25.720 --> 31:26.720
Where are you?

31:29.520 --> 31:30.749
<i>I'm not coming down there.</i>

31:47.600 --> 31:48.600
What's your name?

31:51.360 --> 31:53.720
I know you're scared,
but please will you tell me your name?

31:54.080 --> 31:54.911
<i>Jared.</i>

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
<i>It's Jared.</i>

31:59.680 --> 32:00.875
What happened here, Jared?

32:02.960 --> 32:04.189
Where's Professor Newman?

32:05.160 --> 32:06.594
<i>You need to get away from here.</i>

32:07.000 --> 32:08.912
<i>I'm not coming down. No way.</i>

32:10.960 --> 32:12.314
What are you so scared of?

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
Jared?

32:22.400 --> 32:23.400
Are you still there?

32:28.920 --> 32:30.559
You can talk to me, Jared.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.633
I want to help you.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.719
<i>You can't help me.
Not until the whole place is secure.</i>

32:45.600 --> 32:47.239
There's no one else here right now.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.400
<i>What?</i>

32:54.720 --> 32:56.240
<i>What do you mean, there's no one else?</i>

32:57.000 --> 32:58.514
What are you talking about?

32:58.880 --> 33:00.439
We need a fucking army!

33:02.240 --> 33:03.310
It's just you...

33:07.800 --> 33:08.800
and me.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.560
Where are the others?

33:26.720 --> 33:30.316
Why don't you just calm down
and tell me what happened out there?

33:38.080 --> 33:39.400
Containment job, they said.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.478
Zip it up, sit on it,
await further instructions.

33:45.280 --> 33:46.350
Two teams of six.

33:47.280 --> 33:50.398
Six cans of VX gas,
sitting and waiting in the back of the van.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.757
Felt a bit heavy-handed to me,
but what do I know?

33:56.720 --> 33:58.552
We tracked the one we knew about,
no problem.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.873
Barricaded himself in his bedroom.

34:01.320 --> 34:02.151
Peter...

34:02.200 --> 34:03.520
But he was too strong for us.

34:03.840 --> 34:04.876
We had him on the run

34:06.400 --> 34:08.760
but when we got downstairs,
the place was crawling with 'em.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.754
I was expecting one, maybe two,
not all of them.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.712
Soon as we broke cover, they was all over us.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.554
Every patient, inhuman. Fucking monsters.

34:20.239 --> 34:23.199
I saw three of my guys ripped to pieces
like they was never there.

34:25.679 --> 34:26.679
I got the hell out.

34:28.719 --> 34:29.719
Buggered me leg.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.041
Managed to crawl in here,
thought I could just sit it out.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.270
What about my mother?

34:36.719 --> 34:37.915
Professor Newman.

34:38.920 --> 34:39.920
She was in charge.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.112
I heard them
scratching outside the door for...

34:58.440 --> 35:01.399
Well, I don't know how long they were there.
I lost track of time.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.396
They're not out there now.
I think, if we move now

35:04.440 --> 35:06.496
we should be fine.
- You don't know that though, do you?

35:06.520 --> 35:08.876
I say we get out of here while we still can.
- Is it safe?

35:12.680 --> 35:13.680
It's safe.

35:37.240 --> 35:38.240
Come on!

35:51.040 --> 35:53.032
I... I don't think
we should just leave like this.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.197
No, you're right.
You need to gas the fuckers.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.278
There's six canisters
in the back of that van.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.438
Connect them to the pump
and open the valves.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.680
They'll be like rats in a trap.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.230
What are you waiting for?

36:08.240 --> 36:09.435
You lied to me.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.475
You don't know that's her.

36:14.520 --> 36:15.874
We need to go. Now.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.156
Not without my mother.
- You can't go back in there!

36:18.760 --> 36:20.513
At least, at least give me the keys.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.240
How do I know that I can trust you?
- You can't just leave me here.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.520
What if...

36:25.880 --> 36:27.109
what if you don't make it?

36:30.160 --> 36:31.160
I'll make it.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.837
Mum? I know you're in there!

36:53.080 --> 36:54.833
Please, we have to leave, Mum.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.280
Kaye.

36:58.840 --> 36:59.840
You were right.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.350
I should have listened.

37:03.440 --> 37:04.715
I'm not leaving you here.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.156
Oh!

37:12.840 --> 37:13.840
It's bad, isn't it?

37:16.200 --> 37:17.350
What's happened to you?

37:18.000 --> 37:22.517
I underestimated it.
The replication speed, the host range.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.036
It's not too late. We can fix this.

37:25.080 --> 37:27.595
That's what I thought.
That's what I've been trying to do.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.998
Suffice to say
that in searching for a solution

37:32.280 --> 37:34.397
I ended up becoming part of the problem.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.720
Did you infect yourself?

37:38.760 --> 37:42.071
With a strain.
Not the entire viral vector, no.

37:42.120 --> 37:45.875
At the time,
there was a lack of viable alternatives.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.795
Which is ironic,
considering how quickly it spreads.

37:48.840 --> 37:50.160
We've got to get you out of here.

37:50.240 --> 37:52.152
No, nothing leaves Kiloran.

37:52.280 --> 37:53.839
And that includes me, I'm afraid.

37:54.120 --> 37:56.840
We'll take you somewhere safe,
away from everyone else.

37:56.880 --> 37:57.880
I'll find a cure.

37:57.920 --> 38:00.230
Yeah but that's what I thought,
and it's too late.

38:06.680 --> 38:08.034
I'm not leaving without you.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.120
Come on...

38:55.000 --> 38:56.036
Grab the pole!

40:10.160 --> 40:11.160
Go, go!

40:12.440 --> 40:13.440
Wait!

40:25.720 --> 40:26.720
Peter...

40:56.120 --> 40:57.918
All I had to do was pull the trigger.

40:59.840 --> 41:01.194
None of this would have happened.

41:03.080 --> 41:06.676
The outbreak... the curfew.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.314
Millions of people would still be alive.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.599
Everything you did, every decision

41:15.880 --> 41:17.360
you was trying to do the right thing.

41:18.560 --> 41:20.836
And the right thing now
is we try and fix this.

41:21.160 --> 41:24.790
If we go back to Kiloran,
we can make it right.

41:26.240 --> 41:27.240
Me and you.

41:27.480 --> 41:28.480
Together.

41:30.760 --> 41:31.955
I know you can do it, Kaye.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.400
You need to...

41:43.840 --> 41:45.069
To...

41:50.400 --> 41:51.595
What happened, Zane?

41:52.680 --> 41:53.680
Can you hear me?

41:55.440 --> 41:56.600
Did he say something?

42:00.360 --> 42:01.360
There's no pulse.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.320
Come on, boy.

43:02.960 --> 43:04.952
No... No, Michael! No-no-no!

43:10.960 --> 43:11.960
In! Get in!

43:12.280 --> 43:13.280
Come on!

43:30.200 --> 43:31.200
Welcome to the party.
