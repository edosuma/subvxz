(mellow music playing)

00:53.400 --> 00:57.166
Don't you love rain
tapping on your window?

00:57.233 --> 01:01.700
Absolutely. I throw open the window,
uncork a bottle of Cold Duck,

01:01.767 --> 01:05.367
and wear my Frederick's of Hollywood
ostrich-feathered nightie.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.633
Just because rain
taps at your window?

01:09.700 --> 01:11.600
Oh, I thought she said Wayne.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.367
My mistake. Sorry.

01:16.867 --> 01:19.166
-Ma, where are you going?
-To the market.

01:19.233 --> 01:20.800
Why? It's raining.

01:20.867 --> 01:25.000
The market's in Miami.
In phoenix, I'd be going in the sun.

01:25.500 --> 01:29.100
Now, Sophia, Rose asked
a perfectly sensible question.

01:29.166 --> 01:31.133
Am I the only one
she surprised?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.300
Oh, Ma.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.700
Rose, I'm going to buy a nectarine.

01:34.767 --> 01:37.100
Every day I buy a nectarine.

01:37.166 --> 01:41.133
At 82, that's life,
taking the bus to buy nectarines.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.600
That's so sad.

01:45.667 --> 01:47.467
Not sad, life.

01:47.533 --> 01:50.066
Sad is when you have
to mash it with a fork.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.467
It's a shame Sophia has nothing
constructive to do.

01:58.533 --> 02:01.734
She needs something
to make her feel more fulfilled.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.500
I know what will make her
feel fulfilled.

02:04.567 --> 02:05.934
-Blanche.
-Blanche.

02:07.000 --> 02:07.967
A hobby.

02:08.033 --> 02:11.266
Oh, I thought you meant a man.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.834
You got a better hobby?

02:14.734 --> 02:17.600
I don't think a hobby is the answer.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.266
Well, what is?

02:19.333 --> 02:20.400
I wish I knew.

02:20.467 --> 02:23.500
Life is as interesting
as you make it.

02:23.567 --> 02:26.633
At ma's age,
it's harder to make the effort.

02:26.700 --> 02:30.300
I should be grateful
she's able to get out,

02:30.367 --> 02:33.400
even if it's only
to buy a nectarine.

02:33.467 --> 02:35.233
Well, since it's raining,

02:35.300 --> 02:38.867
we could tackle those household
chores we talk about.

02:38.934 --> 02:40.967
I'll change the hallway bulb.

02:41.033 --> 02:42.233
I'll help.

02:42.300 --> 02:46.000
I meant rearranging the furniture
in the living room,

02:46.066 --> 02:49.367
cleaning out the garage,
or relining the kitchen shelves.

02:49.433 --> 02:50.567
Bingo!

02:50.633 --> 02:53.834
Oh, bingo's fun on a rainy day.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.367
She was talking about
relining the shelves.

02:57.433 --> 02:59.433
That could be fun too.

02:59.500 --> 03:02.233
We'll divide into teams
and grease our hands.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.800
I got arrested for that once
at a party in Chattanooga.

03:11.133 --> 03:14.600
Oh, my goodness,
look what I found,

03:14.667 --> 03:16.500
double fudge cookies.

03:16.567 --> 03:19.300
I thought we agreed
not to keep cookies around.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.133
Right. After this last box.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.633
You're not going to eat them?

03:22.700 --> 03:27.233
No, we'll go to some dumb country
and try to use them as money.

03:29.734 --> 03:31.900
I thought we were going
to divide up work.

03:31.967 --> 03:33.700
That's right, Rose,
make a fresh pot of coffee

03:33.767 --> 03:36.867
Dorothy, get the plates, and
I'll just tear into these suckers.

03:38.734 --> 03:43.367
(serene music playing)

03:47.900 --> 03:50.367
Hey!
You got any decent nectarines?

03:50.433 --> 03:52.667
There's nothing wrong with those.

03:52.734 --> 03:57.266
I got wax bananas that
will be ripe before these are.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.367
You're crazy.

03:59.433 --> 04:01.467
This nectarine is beautiful.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.934
I never saw a more perfect
piece of fruit.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.667
No?
Then try kissing my behind.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.834
It's a real peach.

04:19.700 --> 04:20.533
Sophia?

04:20.600 --> 04:23.667
Nah, Cesar Chavez. I got hungry.

04:23.734 --> 04:25.700
They giving you a hard time too?

04:25.767 --> 04:27.734
I can't pick a decent nectarine.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.333
This way, they do it.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.133
Why don't you ask for help?

04:32.200 --> 04:36.033
Boy scouts help broads like us.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.734
We got to look after ourselves.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.867
They giving you trouble?

04:38.934 --> 04:42.300
I can't get a refund
on this lamb chop.

04:42.367 --> 04:46.300
When I got it home
the bottom was all fat.

04:46.367 --> 04:47.700
Come with me.

04:47.767 --> 04:50.533
Please,
I don't want to make trouble.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.834
When did I make trouble?

04:52.900 --> 04:54.367
Aisle three.

04:54.433 --> 04:56.767
Oh, relax.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.367
Sir? Uh...

04:58.433 --> 05:02.800
I said you can't return it.
It's against store policy.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.367
Would you sign an
affidavit to that effect?

05:05.433 --> 05:07.333
-A what?
-An affidavit.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.433
It's standard in
any NOPRL investigation.

05:09.500 --> 05:10.533
NOPRL?

05:10.600 --> 05:14.166
The NOPRL, Network of
Older People Retired but Living.

05:15.934 --> 05:19.367
Sophia Petrillo, past president
and legal counsel.

05:19.433 --> 05:21.133
This store's in trouble.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.834
My case is better
than Valerie Harper's.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.033
Excuse me, ladies.
Pardon me.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.400
I there a problem here?

05:27.467 --> 05:32.100
Only if you consider a class action suit
and a boycott by OREP a problem.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.867
I thought it was NOPRL.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.233
It's too big for NOPRL.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.433
-It's up to OREP.
-OREP?

05:37.500 --> 05:40.266
Organization of Retired
and Elderly People.

05:40.333 --> 05:43.066
Sophia Petrillo, executive director

05:43.133 --> 05:46.066
and leader of the '87 march
on Neiman-Marcus.

05:47.467 --> 05:51.066
Mrs. Petrillo, isn't there some way
to resolve this matter?

05:51.133 --> 05:54.633
I'm afraid not. The wheels of
justice are already in motion.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.967
Of course, a refund could
reverse those wheels.

05:58.033 --> 06:00.233
-How much?
-$1.17.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.767
You got it. Here.

06:03.667 --> 06:04.500
Keep the change.

06:04.567 --> 06:07.266
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

06:07.333 --> 06:11.600
Oh, listen,
how much for the nectarine?

06:11.667 --> 06:12.834
It's on the house.

06:12.900 --> 06:15.033
We can't do that.
It against the bylaws.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.333
Ok, pay me 45 cents.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.166
45 cents for one lousy nectarine?

06:22.333 --> 06:24.600
What's inside, a pit or a pearl?

06:27.367 --> 06:29.467
This is a 25 cent nectarine.

06:29.533 --> 06:31.100
Fine. Sold.

06:31.166 --> 06:34.367
Claire, don't just stand there.
Give the man a quarter.

06:36.934 --> 06:42.200
(serene music playing)

06:42.266 --> 06:46.133
When the waiter brought me
a big bowl of gazpacho,

06:46.200 --> 06:47.867
I said, "I ordered the Consommé."

06:47.934 --> 06:50.834
He said, "A hot number
needs something spicy."

06:50.900 --> 06:53.600
I said,
"I'll give you something spicy"

06:53.667 --> 06:55.767
and poured the gazpacho
right down his pants.

06:57.900 --> 07:00.700
So you never went out with him?

07:00.767 --> 07:04.700
No. I just slept with him.
He wasn't my type.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.467
Oh, my goodness.
Blanche, how could you?

07:11.533 --> 07:14.467
Oh, come on, Rose,
she's just teasing you.

07:14.533 --> 07:17.033
That's right, honey.
I'm just teasing.

07:17.100 --> 07:19.433
You always tease the one you love...

07:20.734 --> 07:22.734
actually, tease and tickle...

07:24.633 --> 07:27.400
-actually, tease, tickle, and spank.
-Blanche.

07:30.266 --> 07:31.767
-Actually--
-Blanche.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.467
I'm sorry.

07:35.533 --> 07:37.734
What was I talking about?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.800
Teasing because you love me.

07:39.867 --> 07:41.900
That's right. It's true.

07:41.967 --> 07:44.133
Now, I learned that
during my sorority years

07:44.200 --> 07:47.300
when I was dating
Preston Bougainvillaea.

07:47.367 --> 07:51.367
-Lord, the teasing that boy endured.
-Because of his name?

07:51.867 --> 07:55.467
No, because of his ears.

07:55.533 --> 08:01.233
He had these long floppy ears...
kind of like a basset hound.

08:02.700 --> 08:06.500
When he picked me up
for our blind date,

08:06.567 --> 08:11.934
he jumped out of the car and
bounded up onto the front porch,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.967
and I remember thinking,
"He's going to trip on those ears."

08:17.767 --> 08:21.734
But he didn't. There he stood
before me, introducing himself.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.700
I was still stunned.

08:23.767 --> 08:26.400
I half muttered a "How do you do?"

08:26.467 --> 08:30.600
He said, "I'm sorry,
I didn't hear you."

08:30.667 --> 08:32.834
Well, I don't know
what came over me.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.467
I just blurted out,
"Didn't hear me?

08:35.533 --> 08:39.000
I'd think you could pick up radio
free Europe with those things."

08:45.300 --> 08:46.900
And you know what he did?

08:46.967 --> 08:48.533
He laughed.

08:48.600 --> 08:53.066
Right then and there, I grew very
fond of Mr. Preston Bougainvillaea.

08:53.133 --> 08:56.300
Over the next several months,
we saw each other frequently.

08:56.367 --> 08:59.367
Oh, that's really
very sweet, Blanche.

08:59.433 --> 09:00.767
I know.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.967
By the way, did you know
that the size of a man's ears

09:06.033 --> 09:10.700
is directly proportionate to
the size of his other bodily organs?

09:23.300 --> 09:24.500
What do you mean?

09:26.500 --> 09:29.600
He had a big floppy pancreas, Rose.

09:34.166 --> 09:38.266
Look, could we get back
to lining the shelves? Hmm?

09:38.333 --> 09:40.066
I don't feel like it anymore.

09:40.133 --> 09:41.500
What do you want to do?

09:41.567 --> 09:44.233
I know, let's rent an adult video,

09:44.300 --> 09:46.667
drink mimosas,
and French kiss the pillows.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.700
I don't think so, Blanche.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.433
Fine. I'm out of ideas.
You think of something.

09:57.934 --> 10:00.600
How about rearranging
the living room furniture?

10:00.667 --> 10:05.033
Shouldn't we wait for Sophia?
Maybe she'd like to help.

10:05.100 --> 10:08.934
Honey, she's always exhausted
when she gets back from the market.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.133
She just goes and takes a nap.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.734
Well then, we'll do it right now.
Come on.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.000
Okay.

10:17.066 --> 10:21.834
(music playing)

10:21.900 --> 10:26.066
Take five. Even the sea gulls
stopped listening.

10:26.133 --> 10:28.367
The rain kept our fans away.

10:28.433 --> 10:30.700
Baloney. Every week
we've collected, what,

10:30.767 --> 10:32.567
$20, $30 for the clinic?

10:32.633 --> 10:34.934
Lately, we haven't broken $10.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.667
Why? We're losing our edge.

10:37.734 --> 10:40.734
The excitement is gone.
We're not driven anymore.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.433
Haven't we learned anything
from the tragic examples

10:43.500 --> 10:46.433
of Mike Douglas
and Ferdinand Marcos?

10:48.300 --> 10:50.133
Come on, Sophia...

10:51.066 --> 10:54.600
you know, a little lunch
might cheer you up.

10:54.667 --> 10:55.533
You brought yours?

10:55.600 --> 10:59.900
Nah, this is a nectarine.
I'm waiting for the sausage guy.

10:59.967 --> 11:01.834
So let's see, who's buying?

11:01.900 --> 11:03.100
Pulse or pressure?

11:03.166 --> 11:04.400
Pressure.

11:04.467 --> 11:06.400
140 over 80.

11:06.467 --> 11:08.066
130 over 80.

11:08.133 --> 11:10.467
120 over 70. Your treat, Esther.

11:11.467 --> 11:14.033
And I'd stay away from the sausage.

11:14.100 --> 11:17.567
Come to my art class today.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.066
Did you talk Murray Shimowitz
into posing naked?

11:20.133 --> 11:21.967
He's down to his truss.

11:22.033 --> 11:24.266
I've seen it. It's impressive.

11:24.333 --> 11:28.734
It looked like he had
a turkey platter in his pants.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.266
Besides, it's my hospital day.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.500
You're not feeling good?

11:32.567 --> 11:36.967
I haven't felt good since Hugh Downs
left <i>The Today Show,</i>

11:37.033 --> 11:38.934
but that's not it.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
Hey, look.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.734
Ok, break's over.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.600
Let's pretend
we know what we're doing.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.800
Come on, girls,
give it all you got.

11:48.867 --> 11:50.867
Remember the clinic.

11:50.934 --> 11:53.133
Remember your art and be proud.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.333
Remember an F-sharp and blow.

11:55.834 --> 11:58.033
One, two. One.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.033
(playing
"When The Saints Go Marching In")

12:37.567 --> 12:41.367
(serene music playing)

12:42.734 --> 12:45.100
Well, I guess we should
get back to work.

12:45.166 --> 12:49.834
I suppose so, but a big meal
always makes me sleepy.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.667
Is that why you go right to bed
after a date buys you dinner?

13:00.734 --> 13:02.367
Who said that?

13:02.433 --> 13:04.767
You did.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.900
At the beauty parlor.
Don't you remember?

13:06.967 --> 13:09.266
Agnes said you were
full of hot air.

13:09.333 --> 13:12.600
You said she was jealous
because she wasn't getting any.

13:15.667 --> 13:17.900
I said, "Getting any what?"

13:17.967 --> 13:20.467
You said, "rice pudding."
And I said--

13:20.533 --> 13:23.400
Could we just get back
to moving the furniture?

13:25.266 --> 13:26.900
The weather's cleared up.

13:26.967 --> 13:31.100
We should save a big project
like this for a rainy day.

13:31.166 --> 13:33.734
We agreed not to waste time.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.266
That's a big mistake.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.133
We would regret it forever.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.567
Rose, we're eating pizza,
not getting tattoos.

13:41.700 --> 13:45.066
I've always hated wasting time.

13:45.133 --> 13:47.500
Ever since what happened
to my neighbor in St. Olaf.

13:47.567 --> 13:52.533
Rose, are you about to educate us
on the evils of wasting time

13:52.600 --> 13:56.533
by telling a long,
tedious St. Olaf story?

13:56.600 --> 13:58.400
Do you know a better way?

14:00.967 --> 14:02.633
She has a point.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.367
It was back in 1955,

14:05.433 --> 14:07.767
and we'd just moved
into our first house,

14:07.834 --> 14:10.166
right next door to Pigpen Johanssen.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.667
That wasn't his real name.
That was a nickname.

14:13.734 --> 14:14.967
Pigpen?

14:15.033 --> 14:16.533
No, Johanssen.

14:18.834 --> 14:22.867
Anyway...
Pigpen had just turned 80,

14:22.934 --> 14:25.633
and the town bylaws
made him leave his job

14:25.700 --> 14:27.500
teaching high school
drivers' training.

14:28.567 --> 14:31.100
Come on.
At 80, it was about time.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.166
It had nothing to do with his age.

14:33.233 --> 14:36.300
There was an old law
about driving with your shirt off.

14:37.834 --> 14:40.800
I got arrested for that
in Chattanooga too.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.266
Blanche,
let me ask you a question.

14:45.333 --> 14:48.233
Are you allowed to go
back to Chattanooga?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.967
Are you kidding?
The sheriff still writes.

15:02.133 --> 15:04.100
-Go on, Rose.
-Anyway,

15:04.166 --> 15:07.200
without a job
Pigpen started feeling useless

15:07.266 --> 15:10.000
so the town fathers thought
they'd give him a new job.

15:10.066 --> 15:13.066
Putting up the "welcome to St. Olaf"
sign out on Miller's lane.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.100
Rose,
is there a point to this story?

15:15.166 --> 15:16.467
Yes.

15:16.533 --> 15:20.734
That same year on founder's day
the governor was coming.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.266
And Pigpen forgot
to put up the sign.

15:24.333 --> 15:26.300
And the governor drove
straight through town

15:26.367 --> 15:29.200
without ever realizing
he was in St. Olaf.

15:29.266 --> 15:32.200
I would have thought the glazed
look on everyone's face

15:32.266 --> 15:33.834
would have tipped him off.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.266
So the point is Pigpen
ruined founder's day

15:38.333 --> 15:39.967
all because he was wasting time.

15:40.033 --> 15:43.200
That's right. And the town fathers
took down his picture.

15:43.266 --> 15:45.467
It had always hung
in the St. Olaf auto shop

15:45.533 --> 15:47.266
right next to Andy Granatelli.

15:47.767 --> 15:51.333
My mother used to date him.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.967
You know what he has
under that trench coat?

15:55.000 --> 15:56.533
A wrench?

15:58.633 --> 16:00.433
That's what mother called it.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.867
Anyway, mother was having
trouble with her transmission...

16:10.934 --> 16:14.100
(calm music playing)

16:14.166 --> 16:19.367
It's after 1. You're late.

16:19.433 --> 16:21.066
So dock me.

16:21.133 --> 16:22.567
You do this for free.

16:22.633 --> 16:23.800
Then be grateful.

16:23.867 --> 16:25.033
Anything happening?

16:25.100 --> 16:28.400
We got three in surgery,
two in x-ray.

16:28.467 --> 16:30.734
Deliver these on your break.

16:30.800 --> 16:33.100
In your dreams.

16:33.166 --> 16:36.333
I'm a sunshine lady,
not a teamster.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.433
Get the hell out of here.
Let me do my work.

16:38.934 --> 16:43.533
Oh, your boyfriend
was looking for you.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.900
Sam wheeled himself out here
just to see me?

16:46.967 --> 16:49.333
Yeah. I don't get it.

16:49.400 --> 16:50.734
He must see a side of you

16:50.800 --> 16:53.767
that's hidden
from the rest of the world,

16:53.834 --> 16:56.700
like the dark side of the moon.

16:56.767 --> 17:00.233
You're jealous because you know
you'll never have me.

17:05.467 --> 17:07.300
What's the matter, you don't watch
<i>General Hospital?</i>

17:07.367 --> 17:09.400
This place is a passion pit.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.633
Any flowers for me today?

17:13.700 --> 17:14.533
No.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.333
Are you sure?
The name's Leonard.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.033
I know your name.
You ask me every day.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.734
The answer is always no.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.800
Wait a minute.
I made a mistake.

17:26.867 --> 17:28.467
There are flowers
for you today.

17:28.533 --> 17:30.633
Really? Which one?

17:30.700 --> 17:33.700
All of them. And the balloons too.

17:35.533 --> 17:37.367
There's no one here
to deliver them right now,

17:37.433 --> 17:41.433
so you leave your walker here,
and wheel these to your room.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.767
-Oh, thank you!
-No, thank you!

17:50.200 --> 17:51.500
Hi, Sophia.

17:51.567 --> 17:53.467
Sam!
How you doing?

17:53.533 --> 17:55.233
I'm feeling real good today.

17:55.300 --> 17:56.700
Your strength's coming back.

17:56.767 --> 17:58.900
You wheeled yourself
down the hall.

17:58.967 --> 18:02.433
I'd like to check on
my husband Mr. Carp.

18:02.500 --> 18:03.967
Prostate surgery.

18:04.033 --> 18:05.266
Nothing yet. He'll be fine.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.633
I went through it myself
20 years ago.

18:10.667 --> 18:13.000
You had prostate surgery?

18:13.066 --> 18:15.333
What do I look like,
a cross-dresser?

18:16.533 --> 18:19.667
My husband had the surgery.
I went through it.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.934
So, tell me, Sam, what's new?

18:24.000 --> 18:29.033
So, anyway, lars froze solid
right in the lake!

18:29.100 --> 18:32.066
The town fathers mistook him
for max Brinker,

18:32.133 --> 18:34.333
the inventor of herring Krispies...

18:36.867 --> 18:40.367
which, by the way,
go great with borscht.

18:40.433 --> 18:41.500
But what doesn't?

18:42.667 --> 18:43.700
(ding)

18:43.767 --> 18:45.800
Cake's done.

18:45.867 --> 18:47.633
Forty-five minutes.

18:50.734 --> 18:53.400
Gee, why isn't ma
back from the market?

18:53.467 --> 18:56.133
She is probably
resting on a bench.

18:56.200 --> 18:58.600
Her problem's not physical.

18:58.667 --> 19:00.633
She could do more
if she wanted to.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.800
She has energy, not the desire.

19:02.867 --> 19:04.033
Exactly!

19:04.100 --> 19:08.967
Her mother lived to be 94
and was active till the end.

19:09.033 --> 19:14.433
When grandma was in a wheelchair,
she was always on the go,

19:14.500 --> 19:17.900
but always had time to talk
to her grandchildren.

19:17.967 --> 19:21.667
If I close my eyes,
I hear her saying,

19:21.734 --> 19:24.800
"Come on, you snot-nosed
little rug rats."

19:26.767 --> 19:28.033
"Pick up those jacks.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.667
They're puncturing holes
in my tires."

19:32.600 --> 19:36.233
But what's amazing about grandma
is that in 1952,

19:36.300 --> 19:38.834
she decided to go into politics!

19:38.900 --> 19:40.533
Politics?

19:40.600 --> 19:43.000
She felt
it was her personal responsibility

19:43.066 --> 19:45.934
to elect Adlai Stevenson president.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.467
She didn't care for Eisenhower

19:47.533 --> 19:50.400
because he claimed
to have liberated Italy.

19:50.467 --> 19:54.000
She said Italy was liberated enough.

19:54.066 --> 19:57.834
Already too many people
eating meat on Friday

19:57.900 --> 20:00.567
-and wearing condoms on Saturday.
-Oh!

20:05.500 --> 20:06.934
Whatever happened to her?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.667
She colonized life on Venus.

20:13.133 --> 20:15.533
Rose, she was 94 when I was 6!

20:15.600 --> 20:17.700
She died, you idiot.

20:19.934 --> 20:21.533
How did she die?

20:23.900 --> 20:26.166
You know, we're not sure.

20:26.233 --> 20:29.000
One night,
she left in her wheelchair,

20:29.066 --> 20:31.266
and she never came back.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.867
The next day, the neighborhood kids

20:33.934 --> 20:39.233
had a go-cart
with two really big back wheels.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.066
Dorothy,
why don't you just remind Sophia

20:50.133 --> 20:51.767
how active her mama was?

20:51.834 --> 20:53.667
Ma never saw that!

20:53.734 --> 20:55.900
To grandma, it was no big deal.

20:55.967 --> 20:59.400
She just did what
she'd done all her life.

20:59.467 --> 21:04.667
To ma, well, all she saw
was the woman she loved,

21:04.734 --> 21:08.633
growing old and wrinkled
in a wheelchair.

21:08.700 --> 21:12.900
Goes to show how different
generations can be from each other.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.900
-Absolutely.
-I'll say.

21:18.033 --> 21:20.700
Well,
what do you all want to do now?

21:20.767 --> 21:22.667
We aren't going to waste this day.

21:22.734 --> 21:24.600
We have to do
something constructive.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.166
<i>Jeopardy!</i> is on in 15 minutes.

21:26.233 --> 21:28.233
Sounds good to me.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.900
I'll just slice up this
cake and bring it in.

21:33.166 --> 21:36.033
Sophia, don't you have
to go back to work?

21:36.100 --> 21:37.800
Please,
I don't perform brain surgery,

21:37.867 --> 21:40.667
I give people directions
to the cafeteria.

21:40.734 --> 21:43.033
If I like them, I give
them the wrong directions.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.600
Have any visitors today?

21:46.667 --> 21:48.633
Mom and dad were
by this morning.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.100
They brought comic books.

21:50.166 --> 21:53.066
I never let my boy,
Phil, read comic books.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.633
Of course, when he was 16
we shared an underwear drawer.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.533
Did you bring me anything today?

22:00.600 --> 22:02.066
Don't I always.

22:02.133 --> 22:03.433
I thought maybe you forgot.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.767
I never forget.

22:05.834 --> 22:07.834
But I hate nectarines.

22:07.900 --> 22:09.900
You have to eat.

22:09.967 --> 22:13.033
Sophia, it doesn't matter.
You know that.

22:13.100 --> 22:17.166
Crazy talk, comes from not
eating enough fresh food, here.

22:17.233 --> 22:20.066
Sophia, once they goofed up
my blood with that transfusion

22:20.133 --> 22:22.133
there wasn't anything,
anyone could do.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.000
No one's ever beat it, Sophia.

22:24.066 --> 22:25.333
But someday they will.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.867
And it could be tomorrow.

22:26.934 --> 22:28.767
And it could be you.
I believe that.

22:28.834 --> 22:30.200
And you're gonna believe that.

22:30.266 --> 22:34.233
Because, right now, today,
that's all we got, hope.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.867
And a nectarine.

22:37.934 --> 22:39.667
And a nectarine.

22:40.400 --> 22:45.400
(serene music playing)

22:50.066 --> 22:51.100
It's a shame.

22:51.166 --> 22:53.600
We didn't accomplish
anything today.

22:53.667 --> 22:55.667
Of course, we did!

22:55.734 --> 23:00.000
We found out in a pinch, fruit
cocktail is not bad on a bagel.

23:02.867 --> 23:04.567
-Hi, Ma.
-Hello there.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.266
You guys ready for bed already?

23:07.667 --> 23:09.967
I guess we are.

23:10.033 --> 23:11.233
We're very tired.

23:11.300 --> 23:15.567
We took care of a lot of odds and ends
around the house today.

23:15.633 --> 23:16.734
What did you do, Ma?

23:17.233 --> 23:18.800
What did I do today?

23:18.867 --> 23:21.633
What I do every day,
I bought a nectarine.

23:34.033 --> 23:38.166
(theme music playing)
