02:10.763 --> 02:11.961
Welcome back.

02:11.963 --> 02:14.464
If you're just joining us,
we are here behind the scenes

02:14.466 --> 02:17.701
on the set of upcoming Hollywood
horror movie Cain Hill,

02:17.703 --> 02:20.404
starring Damar Martin
And Laura Jean Marsh,

02:20.406 --> 02:24.407
this movie is sick, it's
violent and it's gruesome.

02:24.409 --> 02:28.245
And we've been granted
exclusive access to the set,

02:28.247 --> 02:32.715
which is shooting right here
at the real Cain Hill Asylum.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.851
Something that's made
all the more terrifying

02:34.853 --> 02:37.387
by the fact that this is a true
story

02:37.389 --> 02:39.822
and the events depicted in the
film

02:39.824 --> 02:43.827
happened right where I'm
standing just five years ago.

04:39.845 --> 04:41.014
Hey baby, how are you?

04:41.913 --> 04:42.781
Yeah, wow.

04:43.749 --> 04:46.819
I know, I know, but it's
only for a few days.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.656
I know, but I have to work.

04:52.958 --> 04:53.957
You always tell me you actually
enjoy

04:53.959 --> 04:55.495
your weekends with your mom.

04:57.428 --> 04:58.864
I promise I'll be safe.

05:00.966 --> 05:01.834
Okay,

05:03.067 --> 05:04.534
love you too,

05:04.536 --> 05:05.702
bye.

05:05.704 --> 05:06.572
How is she?

05:07.439 --> 05:08.704
Annoyed I'm working,

05:08.706 --> 05:09.805
and not afraid to tell me about
it.

05:09.807 --> 05:11.908
I think she's a little
worried about us being here.

05:11.910 --> 05:13.442
Understandable.

05:13.444 --> 05:14.644
It always amazes me
how an eight year old

05:14.646 --> 05:16.445
can make you feel so guilty.

05:16.447 --> 05:18.714
And that my friend, is
why I don't have any kids,

05:18.716 --> 05:20.416
freedom to do as I want.

05:20.418 --> 05:21.485
Here's me theory, it's
because you haven't been

05:21.487 --> 05:23.553
in a serious relationship
for at least two years.

05:23.555 --> 05:24.656
... Fuck you.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.757
We should have enough
batteries for the shoot.

05:27.759 --> 05:28.825
I've got the generator in the
car,

05:28.827 --> 05:31.560
but the battery kit should
work the night cameras.

05:31.562 --> 05:33.130
Mike, the tech guy, will make
sure it runs alright anyway.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.663
Good, do you know when we're
shooting

05:34.665 --> 05:36.399
the interviews with the local
residents?

05:36.401 --> 05:37.466
I haven't managed to get
anyone we asked

05:37.468 --> 05:38.702
to agree to be interviewed.

05:38.704 --> 05:40.870
We'll just ask around,
and if anyone's willing

05:40.872 --> 05:42.772
to be on camera, we'll start
shooting.

05:42.774 --> 05:43.973
Leonard will have all the
paperwork.

05:43.975 --> 05:45.474
Good, and I'll keep take
camera around

05:45.476 --> 05:46.877
and get some cool shots of the
town.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.978
Also, it'd be good to get
a shot of the building

05:48.980 --> 05:49.913
looming over the town as well.

05:49.915 --> 05:52.082
Yeah cool, sounds good.... Yeah, good.

05:56.922 --> 05:59.488
That's the whole point of
doing it.

05:59.490 --> 06:01.690
Yeah, I understand but now I'm
on location

06:01.692 --> 06:04.629
so I'm gonna have to call you
back anyway when we get back.

06:05.630 --> 06:07.531
Yeah, all right, cheers.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.031
Problem?

06:09.033 --> 06:09.899
Just post production.

06:09.901 --> 06:11.134
The guy we got to do the offline
edit,

06:11.136 --> 06:14.570
he's been offered more money
elsewhere so he's pulled out.

06:14.572 --> 06:15.772
Shit.

06:15.774 --> 06:17.039
Well how soon can he be
replaced?

06:17.041 --> 06:18.007
I was gonna give it a few
days,

06:18.009 --> 06:20.543
I'll sort it out, you folks
don't need to.

06:20.545 --> 06:23.846
Steve, this is your runner,
this is Richard, your director.

06:23.848 --> 06:24.914
Good to see ya.

06:24.916 --> 06:28.185
And this, well this is,
sorry, did we invite him

06:28.187 --> 06:29.622
or did he break in?

06:31.156 --> 06:32.959
This is Marcus, he's our camera
op.

06:34.192 --> 06:35.024
It's all right, you'll be
fine.

06:35.026 --> 06:36.692
If you wanna know anything, just
ask.

06:36.694 --> 06:37.961
Cool, so we're sorted, ready
to go?

06:37.963 --> 06:39.529
Yep.... Cool.

06:39.531 --> 06:40.596
Let's get hustling, I
guess we've gotta go meet

06:40.598 --> 06:43.199
Mike and Mary at the hive.... Cool, cool, let's go.

06:43.201 --> 06:44.534
Okay Steve, can you help these
guys

06:44.536 --> 06:46.803
load anything they need to into
the van?

06:46.805 --> 06:48.074
Sure, will do.

06:51.509 --> 06:52.808
I've got a good
feeling about this one, Rich.

06:52.810 --> 06:53.776
Me too.

06:53.778 --> 06:57.079
Good script, good location,
good people.

06:57.081 --> 06:59.048
What more could you want?

06:59.050 --> 07:00.550
Bigger budget.

07:00.552 --> 07:02.618
Always in independent
filmmaking,

07:02.620 --> 07:03.923
people want bigger budgets.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.791
But if you want it, you
could always sell a kidney.

07:07.793 --> 07:08.661
Great.

07:09.661 --> 07:10.961
No, no kidneys?

07:57.108 --> 07:59.711
Ah, that is great news, thank
you, Vickie.

08:02.146 --> 08:03.913
Good news?... Yeah, good news,

08:03.915 --> 08:05.848
she's found another editor for
us.

08:05.850 --> 08:07.149
Oh, brilliant.

08:07.151 --> 08:09.685
And the best bit is it's
less than the last guy

08:09.687 --> 08:11.587
'cause you managed to
persuade him for a contact

08:11.589 --> 08:13.255
that it's a great opportunity.

08:13.257 --> 08:15.060
... Now that is a relief.

08:16.562 --> 08:17.827
So now our only problem
is sticking to schedule.

08:17.829 --> 08:19.064
So where is Steve?

08:44.322 --> 08:45.854
Find everything you needed
today, sir?

08:45.856 --> 08:48.660
Yeah, thanks, just
there's some, pump four.

08:50.828 --> 08:51.828
You guys filming something?

08:51.830 --> 08:54.196
What?... Your equipment?

08:54.198 --> 08:55.967
Oh yes, a documentary.

08:57.001 --> 08:59.069
Let me guess, Cain Hill.

08:59.071 --> 09:01.671
Yeah, how'd you guess?

09:01.673 --> 09:02.504
Everyone who comes in here

09:02.506 --> 09:03.739
is always interested in Cain
Hill.

09:03.741 --> 09:04.676
Oh, yeah?

09:05.910 --> 09:08.344
I don't know why, it's
just an old building.

09:08.346 --> 09:10.379
People have gone missing
there.

09:10.381 --> 09:13.617
People go missing all over
the world every day, so what?

09:13.619 --> 09:16.252
It's just a load of
internet hype if you ask me.

09:16.254 --> 09:17.123
I guess.

09:20.759 --> 09:24.060
That is 52 pounds 50
altogether.

09:24.062 --> 09:26.228
All right, and,

09:26.230 --> 09:27.099
that.

09:28.232 --> 09:31.133
... Nice.

09:31.135 --> 09:35.839
Yeah.

09:35.841 --> 09:40.844
Let's go, let's
go, let's go, come on.

09:40.846 --> 09:43.012
What have you got there?... Nothing.

10:15.346 --> 10:17.347
So we put all that in.

10:17.349 --> 10:19.848
You can do that in the
time you've got, right?

10:19.850 --> 10:21.751
Yeah, that shouldn't take
more than an hour or two.

10:21.753 --> 10:22.419
There ya go.

10:22.421 --> 10:23.289
Oh, Mary!

10:30.796 --> 10:32.328
Mary, this is Richard, our
director.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.430
Richard, this is Mary, our
researcher.

10:34.432 --> 10:36.266
Good to meet you, Richard.... Nice to meet you too, Mary.

10:36.268 --> 10:37.800
So you're our expert on Cain
Hill?

10:37.802 --> 10:39.435
Well, I wouldn't say expert

10:39.437 --> 10:42.439
but I've done my research
and I know enough.

10:42.441 --> 10:45.041
Ah, the gatekeeper.... Yeah, well I've been wanting

10:45.043 --> 10:46.443
to check the place out for
awhile.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.877
I hear some of the
stories are a bit intense.

10:48.879 --> 10:50.479
Intense is one word for them.

10:50.481 --> 10:51.980
Well, thanks for being a part of
this.

10:51.982 --> 10:52.916
Thanks for having me.

10:52.918 --> 10:56.087
Okay then, people, let's
gather 'round.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.057
Okay, welcome to first day of
production.

11:02.059 --> 11:04.294
This is Mary, she's our research
expert.

11:04.296 --> 11:06.296
She knows everything there
is to know about Cain Hill

11:06.298 --> 11:09.132
but specifically about
ex-inmate Chester Lockhart.

11:09.134 --> 11:10.267
Now plan of action today, Rich,

11:10.269 --> 11:12.901
I'm gonna need you to take
Marcus and Mary into town,

11:12.903 --> 11:15.805
speak to locals, get as much B
cam footage as you can, yeah?

11:15.807 --> 11:16.805
Yeah, no worries.

11:16.807 --> 11:19.074
Okay, and I'm gonna go
with Michael and Steve.

11:19.076 --> 11:20.810
We're gonna get things prepped.

11:20.812 --> 11:21.511
You know where we're meeting,
yeah?

11:21.513 --> 11:22.612
I know it's on the call sheet,

11:22.614 --> 11:24.980
I'm not too confident about
the area, to be honest.

11:24.982 --> 11:25.915
No worries, I'll swing around
the hotel,

11:25.917 --> 11:27.816
I'll grab you there, yeah?

11:27.818 --> 11:30.119
Now, most importantly
today, guys, is safety.

11:30.121 --> 11:31.887
We are going to an old abandoned
building.

11:31.889 --> 11:33.790
It is gonna be derelict and run
down

11:33.792 --> 11:36.191
so just be careful, please.... You actually care?

11:36.193 --> 11:37.026
About you?

11:37.028 --> 11:39.295
No, about production insurance,
yes.

11:40.298 --> 11:41.830
Rich, have you got
anything you want to say?

11:41.832 --> 11:43.233
Yeah, sure.

11:43.235 --> 11:45.068
Guys, thank you so much for
being here.

11:45.070 --> 11:46.102
It's gonna be a long weekend

11:46.104 --> 11:48.238
but an enjoyable one, I hope.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.473
So let's be smart, be safe,

11:50.475 --> 11:52.876
get in there and get some great
footage.

11:52.878 --> 11:53.709
All right?

11:53.711 --> 11:54.844
Let's get going guys, let's
go.

11:54.846 --> 11:56.012
Thanks guys.

12:04.089 --> 12:05.954
Are we rolling Marcus?

12:05.956 --> 12:06.890
Okay, great, here we go.

12:06.892 --> 12:09.729
So could you start by giving us
your name?

12:12.464 --> 12:13.833
I'd really rather not.

12:15.133 --> 12:17.199
Okay, but you
own the local butcher's

12:17.201 --> 12:18.334
here in the town, right?

12:18.336 --> 12:19.502
I do, yes.

12:19.504 --> 12:22.438
And you claim to
have seen Chester Lockhart.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.138
Claim?

12:23.140 --> 12:26.010
Well, a lot of people claim but

12:27.511 --> 12:30.847
people around here are afraid
of what goes on up there

12:30.849 --> 12:33.916
and we don't like to talk about
it much.

12:33.918 --> 12:36.018
I appreciate that
but if there's anything at all

12:36.020 --> 12:37.887
you can tell us.

12:37.889 --> 12:41.190
I can tell you he's broken
into my place numerous times

12:41.192 --> 12:44.594
and it's Lockhart, I'm sure of
it.

12:44.596 --> 12:46.496
What was stolen, money?

12:46.498 --> 12:47.967
Money, no, meat,

12:48.866 --> 12:50.902
lots of meat every time, but,

12:52.102 --> 12:52.971
I suppose

12:54.172 --> 12:55.905
a man's got to eat.

12:55.907 --> 12:56.605
Okay, but what makes
you

12:56.607 --> 12:57.906
think it was Chester Lockhart?

12:57.908 --> 12:59.242
Have you ever seen him?

12:59.244 --> 13:02.782
Well, we installed a
lot of these newfangled CT

13:05.583 --> 13:07.083
V cameras

13:07.085 --> 13:10.320
and I put them in and
he smashed them all up

13:10.322 --> 13:13.122
and then the next time when I
got them in,

13:13.124 --> 13:15.057
he'd smash them again.

13:15.059 --> 13:17.228
What made you
think it was him though?

13:22.366 --> 13:23.235
This.

13:36.347 --> 13:39.047
... Well, that went well.

13:39.049 --> 13:41.383
Yeah, people just didn't
want to talk about it.

13:41.385 --> 13:42.451
To be honest, with everything
that's happened here,

13:42.453 --> 13:43.953
I'm not really surprised.

13:43.955 --> 13:45.188
People are probably sick and
tired

13:45.190 --> 13:46.156
of talking about the place.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.424
Doesn't help us though
for the documentary.

13:48.426 --> 13:49.360
Yeah, we'll just

13:50.528 --> 13:52.594
head back to the hotel, get
ourselves sorted tomorrow

13:52.596 --> 13:55.134
and we'll catch some great
footage at the asylum.

13:56.167 --> 13:58.300
There's my dream team.

13:58.302 --> 14:01.170
What's up, how'd it go?... Not great.

14:01.172 --> 14:04.040
People are sick of talking
about the place, I think.

14:04.042 --> 14:06.408
Don't worry about it, that's
where the real story is.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.377
Did you get the release
forms for the interview?

14:08.379 --> 14:10.313
We did, not many, but I got
them.

14:10.315 --> 14:11.113
All right, let's go to the
hotel,

14:11.115 --> 14:12.985
grab some grub then, yeah?... Cool.

14:34.272 --> 14:35.604
I love this guy, I've been
working

14:35.606 --> 14:37.406
with him for years now.... You certainly have.

14:37.408 --> 14:38.342
My work wouldn't be half as
good

14:38.344 --> 14:40.008
if I didn't have this guy
directing me.

14:40.010 --> 14:41.044
Stop it, you're gonna make me
blush.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.377
I'm serious.

14:42.379 --> 14:45.180
Well, I've only known
you for a couple of hours.

14:45.182 --> 14:46.148
Probably best to reserve
judgment

14:46.150 --> 14:46.816
'til after the weekend then.

14:46.818 --> 14:48.151
And by the end of filming,

14:48.153 --> 14:50.118
you'll agree with me, I know it.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.286
Isn't he nice when he's drunk?

14:51.288 --> 14:52.222
Get a couple of beers inside,

14:52.224 --> 14:53.723
he's a proper little sweetheart
isn't he?

14:54.659 --> 14:56.224
How do you know so much about
Cain Hill?

14:56.226 --> 14:57.727
Yeah, I wanted to
ask that.

14:57.729 --> 15:01.030
Well, I was always kind
of interested in the stories

15:01.032 --> 15:03.299
being urban legends and all that

15:03.301 --> 15:05.033
and then a couple of years ago I
decided

15:05.035 --> 15:07.970
I wanted to know a bit
more about my parents.

15:07.972 --> 15:09.973
I was adopted.

15:09.975 --> 15:12.975
You don't have to get out
the miniature violins.

15:12.977 --> 15:16.212
I found out that it was
something to do with Cain Hill.

15:16.214 --> 15:17.647
Really?

15:17.649 --> 15:18.714
Yeah, so I wanted to find out

15:18.716 --> 15:20.382
a bit more about that, you know?

15:20.384 --> 15:22.318
Did you ever find out the
connection?

15:22.320 --> 15:25.354
No, it was something to do
with

15:25.356 --> 15:27.757
investigating the practices at
Cain Hill

15:27.759 --> 15:31.026
but I just kind of became
fascinated with the stories here.

15:31.028 --> 15:34.097
Wow, should have made her
the star of the documentary.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.035
Well, it's nice to have someone
who knows about the place.

15:39.037 --> 15:40.036
Come on then, guys,
Michael's not coming,

15:40.038 --> 15:42.271
he got distracted by a
kebab shop on the way.

15:42.273 --> 15:44.339
So here's to a great shoot

15:44.341 --> 15:47.477
and hoping he's not eating our
supplies.

15:47.479 --> 15:49.081
Cheers.... Cheers.

15:55.186 --> 15:57.686
So how long have you guys
been making films then?

15:57.688 --> 15:59.589
I met Leonard on my
first shoot, actually.

15:59.591 --> 16:03.225
I was an assistant camera op
and we got on really well.

16:03.227 --> 16:05.427
We all wanted to make more work
so we did.

16:05.429 --> 16:07.497
That's amazing.... Yeah.

16:07.499 --> 16:10.233
Do you ever find it hard?... What, doing these job?

16:10.235 --> 16:11.334
Yeah, I mean, it's not easy

16:11.336 --> 16:13.301
not knowing where your next
paycheck's coming from.

16:13.303 --> 16:15.504
True but I'd rather that

16:15.506 --> 16:17.507
then pick up a paycheck at a job
I hate.

16:17.509 --> 16:21.643
I still do, part time
at a department store.

16:21.645 --> 16:22.413
I don't envy you.

16:23.615 --> 16:26.214
I used to work in a DIY shop
actually

16:26.216 --> 16:27.752
with a bunch of complete idiots.

16:28.653 --> 16:30.652
Met a great girl there though.

16:30.654 --> 16:31.523
Lucky girl.

16:33.091 --> 16:35.425
Anyway, I'm hoping that this
project

16:35.427 --> 16:37.292
will be a chance to change all
that.

16:37.294 --> 16:39.762
Have you always wanted
to work in documentaries?

16:39.764 --> 16:43.132
No but I thought I'd
try a different angle

16:43.134 --> 16:45.233
and I did a few short ones
before this.

16:45.235 --> 16:46.605
It's great to have you on
board.

16:48.339 --> 16:49.208
So,

16:50.075 --> 16:52.277
is there someone waiting for you
at home?

16:54.611 --> 16:55.581
It's complicated.

16:56.514 --> 16:58.448
What's complicated
about it?

16:58.450 --> 17:00.315
Get straight to it, don't you?

17:00.317 --> 17:01.552
Life's too short not to.

17:02.620 --> 17:06.823
I was with this guy and he
cheated.

17:06.825 --> 17:09.691
I broke it off, we
spent a few months apart

17:09.693 --> 17:12.728
and then we had a drunk night
together

17:12.730 --> 17:15.597
and now he's trying to
make a go of things again.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.201
Can't shake him?... Exactly.

17:18.435 --> 17:19.669
You know what I'd do in your
situation?

17:19.671 --> 17:21.103
What's that?

17:21.105 --> 17:24.574
Move house and have
someone tell him I died.

17:24.576 --> 17:25.775
Dark.

17:25.777 --> 17:28.376
Yeah, I mean in my experience
if something's complicated

17:28.377 --> 17:31.447
you can make it less
complicated by moving on.

17:31.449 --> 17:32.618
Easier said than done.

17:34.352 --> 17:35.317
What about yourself?

17:35.319 --> 17:36.885
Have you got someone
waiting at home for you?

17:36.887 --> 17:38.322
Best girl in the world.

17:39.656 --> 17:40.823
I don't get to see her
as much as I like though,

17:40.825 --> 17:42.557
she lives with her mum.

17:42.559 --> 17:43.828
Her mum?... My daughter.

17:45.195 --> 17:46.261
Mum and I didn't work out

17:46.263 --> 17:49.467
but she's just the best
little girl in the world.

17:52.136 --> 17:53.469
Aw, she's beautiful.

17:53.471 --> 17:55.438
I don't know how guys like you
do it.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.873
You clearly haven't
had enough to drink then.

17:57.875 --> 17:59.275
I'm gonna have a smoke and then

17:59.277 --> 18:01.212
I'll get us some more drinks.... Sure.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.894
All right guys,
how's things?

18:18.896 --> 18:19.728
Not bad.

18:19.730 --> 18:22.364
How you feeling about the
shoot?

18:22.366 --> 18:23.665
I think we're gonna get
some really good stuff

18:23.667 --> 18:25.334
this weekend.... 100%.

18:25.336 --> 18:28.270
You've seen the pictures from
the locations, haven't ya?

18:28.272 --> 18:30.206
Well, in real life, it's
even better than that.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.511
It's gonna blow your creative
little mind.

18:33.443 --> 18:37.246
Marcus, you excited about the
shoot, yeah?

18:37.248 --> 18:38.116
Yeah.

18:38.782 --> 18:40.248
You okay?

18:40.250 --> 18:42.785
Just a bit nervous about going
up there.

18:42.787 --> 18:43.654
Why?

18:44.622 --> 18:46.622
Just got this uneasy feeling.

18:46.624 --> 18:49.892
Old buildings creep me out.... Understandable.

18:49.894 --> 18:51.794
This one used to be full of
loonies.

18:52.864 --> 18:53.563
Don't worry about it, man,

18:53.565 --> 18:54.497
the whole team's gonna be there.

18:54.499 --> 18:56.632
What if something happens?... Like what?

18:56.634 --> 18:58.170
I don't know, something.

18:58.936 --> 19:00.835
Leonard's got it all sorted.

19:00.837 --> 19:03.338
He scouted the place out.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.373
If anything happens, we'll just
leave.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.309
Whoa, unless it costs us
money.

19:11.982 --> 19:13.548
Got a light?

19:13.550 --> 19:14.418
Yeah, sure.

19:22.527 --> 19:24.563
Couldn't help but overhear you
in there.

19:25.529 --> 19:26.962
Filming, are you?

19:26.964 --> 19:29.765
Oh right, yeah, we're
shooting a documentary.

19:29.767 --> 19:33.369
Yeah, nothing expensive just
cheap kit,

19:33.371 --> 19:34.673
nothing he can steal.

19:35.673 --> 19:38.975
Let me guess, you're here
investigating Cain Hill.

19:38.977 --> 19:39.845
Yeah.

19:41.578 --> 19:42.711
Thought so.

19:42.713 --> 19:45.413
Not that anyone wants to
tell us anything about it.

19:45.415 --> 19:46.782
Do you blame them?

19:46.784 --> 19:49.684
Month after month, some
fanatic comes through this town

19:49.686 --> 19:51.322
asking the same questions.

19:53.857 --> 19:55.560
My dad worked there as a
janitor.

19:56.594 --> 19:58.728
Really?... For years.

19:58.730 --> 19:59.761
Used to come home and
tell us all the stories

19:59.763 --> 20:02.265
he'd heard about the place.

20:02.267 --> 20:03.869
He saw everything.

20:04.969 --> 20:06.238
Everything?

20:07.538 --> 20:08.406
Everything.

20:09.606 --> 20:12.708
Back in '76, Annie and George
Lockhart

20:12.710 --> 20:14.278
were admitted to Cain Hill.

20:15.279 --> 20:17.479
They're the couple that
kidnapped and murdered

20:17.481 --> 20:18.750
all those teenagers, right?

20:22.019 --> 20:23.385
That's them,

20:23.387 --> 20:24.620
claimed that they were doing
God's work,

20:24.622 --> 20:28.290
that they were cleansing
the world of evil.

20:28.292 --> 20:29.258
Nutters.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.495
When they admitted
Annie, she was pregnant

20:33.330 --> 20:34.764
and because of her mental state,

20:34.766 --> 20:36.431
the institute thought it best

20:36.433 --> 20:38.502
that she have the baby inside
the...

20:41.306 --> 20:42.607
Inside the asylum.

20:43.674 --> 20:46.776
On November 16th, 1977,

20:46.778 --> 20:49.847
she gave birth to Chester
Lockhart.

20:51.449 --> 20:52.882
Not long after Chester was born,

20:52.884 --> 20:54.920
George Lockhart killed himself.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.786
He slit his throat with a shard
of glass.

21:00.657 --> 21:02.394
Did Chester remain at Cain
Hill?

21:04.061 --> 21:04.893
He did.

21:04.895 --> 21:07.395
Only one day he spun out and
went mad

21:07.397 --> 21:09.597
and started a massive fire
that killed half the inmates

21:09.599 --> 21:10.801
and loads of the staff.

21:11.769 --> 21:13.605
So what happened to
him?

21:14.605 --> 21:15.805
Who knows?

21:15.807 --> 21:17.442
Some say he died in the fire.

21:18.409 --> 21:21.410
Some say he's in there
now roaming the halls.

21:21.412 --> 21:24.546
People think he's the one
behind the disappearances?

21:24.548 --> 21:25.414
Who knows?

21:25.416 --> 21:27.882
It's just a story, nothing else,
right?

21:27.884 --> 21:28.750
Wouldn't be a cool place

21:28.752 --> 21:30.686
if it didn't have a neat story,
right?

21:30.688 --> 21:33.458
We're going out there tom...... In the next few days.

21:34.491 --> 21:36.560
Nickel's worth of free advice
for you...

21:41.398 --> 21:42.867
Stay well away from that place.

21:46.436 --> 21:47.071
See ya!

21:51.075 --> 21:52.708
What a nutter.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.442
If this was a horror movie,

21:54.444 --> 21:56.845
he'd be the guy that shows
up at the end as the killer.

21:58.048 --> 21:59.114
Yeah, I don't trust him
though,

21:59.116 --> 22:01.052
I'm gonna make sure he's
not stealing from our van.

22:05.088 --> 22:05.956
So,

22:07.424 --> 22:09.124
Mary seems nice.

22:09.126 --> 22:10.125
Yeah, she does.

22:10.127 --> 22:13.129
And you two seem to be
getting on pretty well.

22:13.131 --> 22:14.796
Yeah, she's easy to talk to, I
guess.

22:14.798 --> 22:16.465
Oh, so nothing to do with the
fact

22:16.467 --> 22:18.700
that she's fit as fuck?

22:18.702 --> 22:21.136
Of course not, no, it's
totally platonic

22:21.138 --> 22:24.105
plus I'm a professional,
I can keep it in my pants.

22:24.107 --> 22:26.976
Until after the shoot.... Well then it's alright.

22:28.746 --> 22:29.978
No, I don't know, she's a nice
girl

22:29.980 --> 22:32.480
but I think there's
some kind of complicated

22:32.482 --> 22:33.449
situation going on at home.

22:33.451 --> 22:34.816
And then you're just
gonna waltz in there

22:34.818 --> 22:36.885
and complicate it even further.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.091
I need a drink.

22:42.093 --> 22:43.961
I'll be in in a bit.

22:57.808 --> 22:59.674
So there have been all these
murders

22:59.676 --> 23:03.481
and then people go missing
at this place for years but

23:04.182 --> 23:05.280
nobody's ever been caught.

23:05.282 --> 23:09.117
I mean, it's a little
convenient, don't you think?

23:09.119 --> 23:12.520
Well, I don't make
up the stories, I just,

23:12.522 --> 23:15.524
I followed them and they
were all pretty similar.

23:15.526 --> 23:16.792
Yeah, a bit like all the
people

23:16.794 --> 23:19.728
who claim to have seen
the Loch Ness monster.

23:19.730 --> 23:21.130
Yeah, but what about all the
murders?

23:21.132 --> 23:23.668
You can't deny those and
there's dozens of them.

23:24.868 --> 23:28.136
Well, this place is half
burned down and derelict.

23:28.138 --> 23:30.672
I mean, isn't it just possible
that

23:30.674 --> 23:32.810
people hurt themselves being
there?

23:33.810 --> 23:35.678
There are some survivors.

23:35.680 --> 23:36.815
I mean, not many,

23:37.949 --> 23:42.084
but they all say the same
thing, they were attacked

23:42.086 --> 23:44.152
by a giant man

23:44.154 --> 23:48.623
with a baseball bat with nails
in it wrapped in barbed wire.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.694
And does anybody have any idea
why?

23:51.628 --> 23:54.729
I don't know but he's
never attacked anyone

23:54.731 --> 23:58.769
outside of the building so maybe
he's just

23:59.804 --> 24:02.107
this guy who's protecting his
home?

24:03.074 --> 24:04.739
Is that really that hard to
believe?

24:04.741 --> 24:08.110
Yeah, protecting his home
makes sense but, you know,

24:08.112 --> 24:10.981
doing it in a leather mask
with a lethal weapon doesn't.

24:13.951 --> 24:17.519
Well that's why we're here,
to make sense of it all.

24:17.521 --> 24:19.822
Close, but,

24:19.824 --> 24:22.157
we are here to make a
documentary

24:22.159 --> 24:24.559
about an empty old building

24:24.561 --> 24:25.863
and make it seem exciting.

24:27.565 --> 24:30.632
I have a sneaky feeling
that this Chester guy

24:30.634 --> 24:33.235
is conveniently not gonna show
up

24:33.237 --> 24:37.672
because I think it's a load
of drug-hallucinated crap.

24:37.674 --> 24:40.744
If any of us believed it,
none of us would be here.

24:41.711 --> 24:45.314
But I do think it's a
historically interesting place

24:45.316 --> 24:48.683
and I think with my family's
connections to the place,

24:48.685 --> 24:50.318
it's gonna be really interesting

24:50.320 --> 24:52.688
to work there for the weekend.

24:52.690 --> 24:53.889
I agree.

24:53.891 --> 24:54.890
Well, no, actually,

24:54.892 --> 24:58.661
I think it's gonna be a
long and boring weekend.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.161
So,

25:00.163 --> 25:02.898
I think we are gonna need to
think of ways

25:02.900 --> 25:06.101
of entertaining ourselves
when we're not filming.

25:06.103 --> 25:10.041
So how do you fancy a bit of
strip poker?

25:11.308 --> 25:12.978
I've never played strip poker.

25:15.145 --> 25:17.313
I'm sorry, I don't buy that.

25:17.315 --> 25:19.248
How can you have never played
strip poker?

25:19.250 --> 25:21.784
What kind of girl do you take
me for?

25:21.786 --> 25:23.651
You really think that I'm
gonna take off my clothes

25:23.653 --> 25:24.623
just for a game?

25:25.789 --> 25:27.024
A bet, maybe,

25:28.025 --> 25:29.792
but not just a game.

25:29.794 --> 25:30.929
Well, that's a shame.

25:34.230 --> 25:35.099
And why's that?

25:36.067 --> 25:37.932
'Cause I've never
really been into betting

25:37.934 --> 25:42.071
but I guess now it's gonna have
to change.

25:42.073 --> 25:45.607
Well, it's a shame that
you're sharing a separate room

25:45.609 --> 25:49.612
with someone else and then
for the next few days,

25:49.614 --> 25:52.317
we're gonna be staying
in an abandoned asylum.

25:53.217 --> 25:55.918
But otherwise, I would
take you up on the bet.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.219
Well,

25:57.221 --> 25:58.088
maybe we should

25:59.323 --> 26:03.825
go upstairs and have a preview
at least, see where it goes?

26:03.827 --> 26:05.829
Easy tiger, what about Marcus?

26:07.765 --> 26:09.797
Marcus is

26:09.799 --> 26:11.900
chatting another girl he's had
his eye on.

26:11.902 --> 26:15.136
You know, honestly, if
Marcus has his usual way,

26:15.138 --> 26:16.838
it'll be the bar toilets

26:16.840 --> 26:18.976
or her car that gets it, not our
room.

26:21.979 --> 26:24.145
I'm not sure that I know you
that well.

26:24.147 --> 26:26.382
Well then we really should
get to know each other

26:26.384 --> 26:28.083
a little bit better.

26:28.085 --> 26:31.353
As your director, I insist.

26:31.355 --> 26:32.757
As my director, huh?

26:34.959 --> 26:36.161
For the weekend, at least.

26:39.864 --> 26:40.731
Wait.

26:42.333 --> 26:43.201
Stop.

26:44.701 --> 26:45.703
What's the matter?

26:46.703 --> 26:47.638
It's not right.

26:50.007 --> 26:52.106
What do you mean?

26:52.108 --> 26:53.644
I have a boyfriend.

26:55.413 --> 26:57.112
The ex you can't
shake?

26:57.114 --> 26:58.650
Well, that's beside the point.

27:00.351 --> 27:02.754
I'm not that kind of
girl and it's not right.

27:03.753 --> 27:06.921
Okay, Mary I just thought we
were getting on really well.

27:06.923 --> 27:08.660
And we still will, but,

27:09.894 --> 27:13.298
just once I've told him
that it's completely over

27:14.298 --> 27:16.097
and if you're still interested
then,

27:16.099 --> 27:17.935
then maybe we can go on a date.

27:18.935 --> 27:22.136
But until then, I may be drunk,

27:22.138 --> 27:24.707
but I still have my integrity.

27:24.709 --> 27:27.276
Mary, I was never suggesting
that...

27:27.278 --> 27:28.844
Richard.

27:28.846 --> 27:32.180
I'm gonna go to bed,
we have an early start.

27:32.182 --> 27:34.382
I will see you in the morning,
okay?

27:34.384 --> 27:36.351
Do you guys want anything more
to drink?

27:36.353 --> 27:38.786
It's last order in a minute.

27:38.788 --> 27:40.924
No, I'm okay, thank you.

27:41.925 --> 27:43.424
I'm gonna go to bed.

27:43.426 --> 27:45.326
Are you sure we're okay?

27:45.328 --> 27:47.161
Yeah, of course we are.

27:47.163 --> 27:48.333
Yeah, I just...

27:51.167 --> 27:52.334
Yeah, I'll see you in the
morning.

27:52.336 --> 27:53.203
Okay.

28:00.009 --> 28:00.979
Marcus.

28:02.946 --> 28:03.814
Marcus!

28:05.782 --> 28:06.950
Marcus, it's important!

28:17.060 --> 28:18.494
What's up, Rich?

28:18.496 --> 28:19.495
I really need to talk to you
about Mary.

28:19.497 --> 28:20.430
Oh, well, it's gonna
have to wait a minute,

28:20.432 --> 28:23.701
I am in there with that girl
over there.

28:24.434 --> 28:25.767
I really need a chat, mate.

28:25.769 --> 28:27.004
Oh, man, but she is fit.

28:40.884 --> 28:42.183
See what you've gone and done
now?

28:42.185 --> 28:43.818
Shit.

28:43.820 --> 28:46.488
Go on then, this better be good.

28:46.490 --> 28:48.393
I may need a few more drinks
first.

28:49.926 --> 28:52.861
I've decided, you've probably
had enough, haven't you?

28:52.863 --> 28:54.997
Knowing you though,
you've had a few too many.

28:54.999 --> 28:56.832
No way, you just ruined my
chance

28:56.834 --> 28:58.432
with that feisty lady.

28:58.434 --> 29:01.804
Now I need some more
alcohol and you're buying.

29:01.806 --> 29:04.342
Trust me, I'll be fine, come on,
let's go.

29:21.057 --> 29:22.426
Are you okay, Marcus?

29:24.394 --> 29:26.862
You sure?... He's all right.

29:26.864 --> 29:29.067
Just one or two too many
last night, that's all.

29:30.433 --> 29:32.069
Look alive, guys, we're here.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.956
Hi, you must be the owner of
Cain Hill.

30:25.623 --> 30:27.221
I'm Leonard Kinster, the
Producer.

30:27.223 --> 30:29.924
Mr. Kinster, I'm here
on behalf of the owners,

30:29.926 --> 30:32.960
I'm Elizabeth Barrett, the
key master of Cain Hill.

30:32.962 --> 30:35.296
Question, do you know the
gatekeeper?

30:35.298 --> 30:39.101
Yeah, or Zuul?

30:39.103 --> 30:40.936
Shall we?... Please.

30:46.277 --> 30:47.910
This is the entrance hallway,

30:47.912 --> 30:49.644
one of the only public
places in the building

30:49.646 --> 30:51.580
so it's been well maintained.

30:51.582 --> 30:54.682
Unfortunately the same cannot
be said about the rest.

30:54.684 --> 30:56.617
This place is amazing.

30:56.619 --> 30:57.986
Pretty impressive,
huh?

30:57.988 --> 30:59.388
It's even better than the
photos.

30:59.390 --> 31:02.360
It's giving me the
chills.

31:07.397 --> 31:08.396
The second and third floors

31:08.398 --> 31:10.565
have encountered a lot
of damage over the years

31:10.567 --> 31:12.566
since it shut 40 years ago.

31:12.568 --> 31:14.236
In fact, the fires left parts of
it

31:14.238 --> 31:16.270
being declared highly unsafe,

31:16.272 --> 31:19.540
hence our reluctance to let you
film here.

31:19.542 --> 31:23.077
The main issue we have is with
the security of the building.

31:23.079 --> 31:24.246
And that's all good.

31:24.248 --> 31:25.980
Mr. Kinster,

31:25.982 --> 31:29.084
your safety and your wellbeing
is your own responsibility.

31:29.086 --> 31:31.486
That was made very clear from
the outset.

31:31.488 --> 31:33.988
Should anything happen
during your time here,

31:33.990 --> 31:35.190
our concern is limited only

31:35.192 --> 31:37.292
with the security of the
building,

31:37.294 --> 31:39.026
a building which is very old

31:39.028 --> 31:42.564
and one that holds great
significant value to the owners.

31:42.566 --> 31:44.565
You and your colleagues are only
here

31:44.567 --> 31:46.535
by their gracious good will

31:46.537 --> 31:48.269
and should anything
happen during your stay,

31:48.271 --> 31:50.171
damages will be chargeable

31:50.173 --> 31:52.309
and you will be held
completely responsible.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.978
I was just making a joke.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.446
I see.

32:10.994 --> 32:12.760
That's great, that.

32:12.762 --> 32:15.596
We should've got more.... It's pretty creepy.

32:15.598 --> 32:17.365
I know.

32:30.381 --> 32:32.546
So those are the basic house
rules

32:32.548 --> 32:34.451
that the owners wanted me to
express.

32:35.352 --> 32:37.084
I take it there won't be any
problems.

32:37.086 --> 32:38.420
No, not a problem.

32:38.422 --> 32:40.255
Thank you very much for
your time, Ms. Barrett

32:40.257 --> 32:43.091
and, yeah, thanks for showing us
around.

32:43.093 --> 32:43.961
Quite.

32:45.295 --> 32:46.264
Here's your keys.

32:48.499 --> 32:49.968
Word of advice,

32:50.768 --> 32:54.369
keep the doors locked at all
times.

32:54.371 --> 32:55.504
Uh,

32:55.506 --> 32:56.374
thanks?

32:58.375 --> 33:00.642
... There is no Dana.

33:00.644 --> 33:04.115
... Only Zuul.

33:09.219 --> 33:12.254
It's gonna take a few
trips to get this kit inside.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.555
No worries, I've set
aside the rest of the day

33:13.557 --> 33:15.222
for set up.... Do you need a hand?

33:15.224 --> 33:17.058
Yeah, that'd be great, thank
you.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.660
Marcus, do you mind
grabbing some exterior shots

33:18.662 --> 33:19.661
while we're unloading, just so
we can see

33:19.663 --> 33:20.528
the difference in the
place during the day?

33:20.530 --> 33:22.663
Yep, no problem.... Okay, thank you.

33:22.665 --> 33:24.466
Steve, you good, you
got everything you need?

33:24.468 --> 33:25.566
Yeah, I'm good,
thanks.

33:25.568 --> 33:26.535
Michael, do you wanna come in
with us

33:26.537 --> 33:28.503
or do you want us to
come back down to you?

33:28.505 --> 33:31.209
I'm in no rush to go back
inside there, believe me.

34:18.121 --> 34:18.954
Okay, now we've got all the
kit in,

34:18.956 --> 34:21.188
let's decide what room to move
in.

34:21.190 --> 34:22.159
Here we go.

34:24.628 --> 34:25.596
Okay.

34:30.266 --> 34:32.233
Here, where's best for ya?... Well, we can't do much

34:32.235 --> 34:34.469
until Mike gets the
cameras up and running.

34:34.471 --> 34:36.206
Where are you thinking for a
base?

34:37.172 --> 34:38.472
That's actually the biggest
room

34:38.474 --> 34:40.440
and we're right here so
we might as well just

34:40.443 --> 34:41.742
move in there, no point in
moving it all.

34:41.744 --> 34:42.612
Cool.

34:44.481 --> 34:46.780
I'm just gonna see if
there's a room through here.

34:46.782 --> 34:47.782
Do you need anything?

34:47.784 --> 34:49.784
Nah, I just need to
find a nice, quiet room

34:49.786 --> 34:51.588
and I'll be good to go.... Cool.

35:06.570 --> 35:08.869
This room's great, what's
with all the monitors?

35:08.871 --> 35:10.905
This is obviously used
to run the building's

35:10.907 --> 35:13.407
security from, I think we
can hook up our cameras

35:13.409 --> 35:16.510
to these monitors but the
real interesting thing,

35:16.512 --> 35:18.947
I think this used to be the
safe room for the staff.

35:18.949 --> 35:20.615
Check out the door.

35:22.518 --> 35:24.519
Does that lock from the
inside?

35:24.521 --> 35:25.519
Yeah.

35:25.521 --> 35:26.521
Planning on
locking yourself in here

35:26.523 --> 35:27.389
all weekend, Mike?... That's a very good idea,

35:27.391 --> 35:30.191
Richard, I think I might.

35:30.193 --> 35:32.661
So what are you guys actually
doing?

35:32.663 --> 35:34.963
Richard wants everything
monitored while we're here

35:34.965 --> 35:37.802
so we're gonna set up a
network of these little things.

35:38.768 --> 35:39.900
So no matter what happens, day
or night,

35:39.902 --> 35:41.936
we can capture it on camera.

35:41.938 --> 35:43.604
Have you decided
where you wanna put 'em yet?

35:43.606 --> 35:47.275
Yeah, main stairwell,
hallways,

35:47.277 --> 35:49.811
main hall and a few additional
rooms.

35:49.813 --> 35:52.646
According to the research the
second floor

35:52.648 --> 35:55.550
was reserved for the less
violent patients

35:55.552 --> 35:57.219
with the top floor serving as
the home

35:57.221 --> 35:58.653
for the more exciting patients,
right?

35:58.655 --> 36:01.423
Yeah, so each floor ran
individually.

36:01.425 --> 36:02.958
Staff were allocated a floor

36:02.960 --> 36:04.959
and a set amount of patients
each.

36:04.961 --> 36:07.528
Do we know where Chester
stayed?

36:07.530 --> 36:09.231
Third floor.

36:09.233 --> 36:10.264
So I wanna get the
cameras set up there first,

36:10.266 --> 36:11.999
I don't wanna miss a thing.

36:12.001 --> 36:14.635
So wait, do we actually have a
plan?

36:14.637 --> 36:15.572
You know,

36:16.706 --> 36:18.405
if we see him.

36:18.407 --> 36:19.974
Seriously?

36:21.112 --> 36:24.012
We're documentary filmmakers,
we're not Ghostbusters.

36:24.014 --> 36:25.512
I wouldn't risk myself or any
of team if I actually thought

36:25.514 --> 36:28.416
there was any substance in this
bullshit.

36:28.418 --> 36:29.751
Our job is to make
things seem interesting,

36:29.753 --> 36:30.922
even if they may not be.

36:32.521 --> 36:34.956
So this is where the party is.

36:34.958 --> 36:36.858
Okay, audio equipment
is in and so is the kit

36:36.860 --> 36:38.659
and the doors are now locked.

36:38.661 --> 36:41.996
We have checked in to hotel Cain
Hill.

36:41.998 --> 36:44.298
Boss, do we get bed and
breakfast?

36:44.300 --> 36:45.133
Oh, sleeping bags, sugar puffs

36:45.135 --> 36:46.967
and Steve servicing ya.

36:46.969 --> 36:49.670
Okay, you are gonna need
those to put your cameras out.

36:49.672 --> 36:51.706
I will need them back
to me once you're done.

36:51.708 --> 36:53.608
Cool, I'm gonna get some pick
up shots

36:53.610 --> 36:55.546
and take a look around.... Sure thing.

37:02.052 --> 37:02.920
So...

37:04.521 --> 37:06.454
Pretty good at all this techy
stuff, huh?

37:06.456 --> 37:08.690
Oh, pretty good.... Love it.

37:08.692 --> 37:11.358
We'll see how you
feel in a decade or two.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.028
Look, can you find the
mains power for this place?

37:14.030 --> 37:15.796
I need to charge up these
batteries,

37:15.798 --> 37:17.365
we haven't got lights or power.

37:17.367 --> 37:18.633
We were told that there would be
some,

37:18.635 --> 37:21.869
so I'm figuring it's just the
breakers.

37:21.871 --> 37:23.007
Oh, okay.

37:24.708 --> 37:25.706
Any ideas?

37:25.708 --> 37:27.541
I'd imagine
it's in the basement.

37:27.543 --> 37:28.411
Take a torch.

37:29.079 --> 37:30.378
Right.

37:30.380 --> 37:31.579
Yeah, no, sure.

37:31.581 --> 37:32.717
I can do that.

38:01.644 --> 38:02.512
Nice.

38:31.574 --> 38:32.909
Oh, oh god.

38:33.909 --> 38:36.379
Oh god, no, no, no.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.447
Bloody.

38:57.501 --> 38:58.502
Excellent.

39:02.105 --> 39:03.641
Genius.

41:40.996 --> 41:41.865
Hello?

41:50.639 --> 41:53.608
As you can see, Annie
was an expensive inmate,

41:53.610 --> 41:55.610
she requested haircuts every
week

41:55.612 --> 41:57.612
and new clothes all the time.

41:57.614 --> 41:59.949
Murdering all those teenagers
didn't cramp her style.

42:02.652 --> 42:03.584
Whoa, what's the matter?

42:03.586 --> 42:05.920
Richard, I was looking around.

42:05.922 --> 42:08.188
Okay, breathe, and what
happened?

42:08.190 --> 42:10.325
I went upstairs to
take a look around and I,

42:10.327 --> 42:12.193
I heard this sound.

42:12.195 --> 42:13.595
Jesus, did you hurt yourself?

42:13.597 --> 42:14.463
No, I'm fine.

42:14.465 --> 42:16.965
So you heard a sound and then
what?

42:16.967 --> 42:18.231
Well, nothing,

42:18.233 --> 42:20.001
I freaked out and I came back
down here.

42:20.003 --> 42:21.101
Oh, you freaked out
when you heard the sound?

42:21.103 --> 42:22.804
Wasn't just any sound!

42:22.806 --> 42:25.072
Well, you're safe now,
that's what matters.

42:25.074 --> 42:27.008
I don't think we should stay
here, Rich.

42:27.010 --> 42:29.747
We've only just got here,
everyone's a bit on edge.

42:30.947 --> 42:33.146
Or we could just play a fun
game called

42:33.148 --> 42:35.617
man the fuck up, go on.

42:35.619 --> 42:38.720
Maybe just sit down for a
minute.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.088
Mary, do you mind grabbing
him a bottle of water?

42:40.090 --> 42:41.789
Sure.

42:41.791 --> 42:44.094
Recharge, have drink, take a
breather.

42:47.797 --> 42:48.862
We need to get the cameras up
and running

42:48.864 --> 42:49.863
as soon as possible.

42:49.865 --> 42:53.066
It's gonna be hours
until they're ready yet.

42:53.068 --> 42:54.135
You're not buying into this, are
ya?

42:54.137 --> 42:55.369
I trust him.

42:55.371 --> 42:57.738
I don't wanna take any chances.

42:57.740 --> 42:59.043
Fine, yep, cool.

43:02.311 --> 43:03.179
A dead,

43:04.414 --> 43:06.850
bloody badger, Mike.

43:07.784 --> 43:11.719
It took 10 minutes to get out of
my shoe.

43:11.721 --> 43:15.960
It fucking stank.... And we're in business!

43:17.260 --> 43:20.360
Bloody hell, how many
cameras do we have up?

43:20.362 --> 43:22.632
There's 32
of them all together.

43:23.766 --> 43:26.967
And they're all
recording at the same time?

43:26.969 --> 43:30.137
Yeah, they all feed back
to the master recorder.

43:30.139 --> 43:32.874
They record everything 24/7,
that's where we can review it

43:32.876 --> 43:34.845
all afterwards and decide what
we need.

43:36.278 --> 43:38.179
32 cameras.

43:38.181 --> 43:40.014
It's a bit excessive, don't you
think?

43:40.016 --> 43:42.717
It is a lot but
we've got a TV show to make.

43:42.719 --> 43:44.284
Plus it's gonna make me feel a
lot better

43:44.286 --> 43:45.920
sleeping here for the next few
nights

43:45.922 --> 43:48.789
knowing that we've got
a camera on everything.

43:48.791 --> 43:50.258
You know,

43:50.260 --> 43:51.793
just in case.

43:58.068 --> 43:58.936
That's it.

44:00.836 --> 44:03.172
And slowly pull focus in
the end of the corridor.

44:04.907 --> 44:06.039
That's it.

44:06.041 --> 44:08.311
Beautiful, lovely shots.

44:12.114 --> 44:13.317
And cut there, please.

44:14.317 --> 44:15.782
I wanna intercut these location
shots

44:15.784 --> 44:17.184
with the green screen
stuff I'm gonna shoot

44:17.186 --> 44:18.385
without you in a few weeks'
time.

44:18.387 --> 44:20.287
That's fine with me, it's
looking good.

44:20.289 --> 44:22.990
The actor, they should
be sorted in the next

44:22.992 --> 44:25.126
couple of weeks,
negotiations with the agent's

44:25.128 --> 44:27.195
taking a bit longer, but,
yeah, should be sorted.

44:27.197 --> 44:28.130
Cool, well, let's worry about

44:28.132 --> 44:29.863
getting the location stuff
sorted first,

44:29.865 --> 44:31.164
I want to keep the pace up.

44:31.166 --> 44:32.499
Yeah, that's true, just in
case Chester

44:32.501 --> 44:35.802
makes another appearance.... Fuck the both of you.

44:50.987 --> 44:52.286
Oh, wow, you know it was
exactly

44:52.288 --> 44:54.121
this sort of luxury I had in
mind

44:54.123 --> 44:56.758
when I was paying my
way through university.

44:56.760 --> 44:58.458
Yeah, I was led to
believe there would be

44:58.460 --> 45:01.762
luxury bedding provided.

45:01.764 --> 45:03.363
Well, you bollocks,
if you wanted luxury,

45:03.365 --> 45:05.068
you should've packed it like me.

45:08.838 --> 45:10.371
What the fuck?... Bastard.

45:10.373 --> 45:13.173
I knew you'd do something like
this.

45:18.947 --> 45:22.083
Leonard, please, boss, best
boss.

45:22.085 --> 45:24.050
I'm a girl, you're not gonna
let me sleep on the cold,

45:24.052 --> 45:25.353
hard floor are you?

45:25.355 --> 45:26.887
All right, sleep wherever you
want,

45:26.889 --> 45:30.358
just not on my bed.... Cold, boss.

45:30.360 --> 45:31.729
No, you're right.

46:20.876 --> 46:22.577
You know, I do hope
I don't get a bad back

46:22.579 --> 46:24.345
lying on this cold floor.

46:24.347 --> 46:25.579
I wouldn't be able to work now,
would I?

46:25.581 --> 46:27.315
Well, you could sleep in the
van.

46:27.317 --> 46:28.452
Floor it is, then.

46:30.286 --> 46:31.954
Is Michael coming down?

46:34.389 --> 46:35.555
Steve!

46:35.557 --> 46:36.456
Yeah?

46:36.458 --> 46:37.960
Mike, is he coming down?

46:39.262 --> 46:40.961
Yeah, he was just finishing
something,

46:40.963 --> 46:43.063
he'll be down when it's done.

46:43.065 --> 46:44.197
Yeah, I just think it'll be
better

46:44.199 --> 46:46.032
if we're all sleeping together.

48:00.376 --> 48:02.108
Mike?

48:02.110 --> 48:03.476
Mike.

48:03.478 --> 48:04.347
Michael!

48:05.215 --> 48:07.651
Come on, mate, Leonard's got us
bacon.

48:10.018 --> 48:11.017
Really?

48:11.019 --> 48:13.521
No, he's got us cereal
and from the taste of it

48:13.523 --> 48:14.625
month-old milk.

48:16.224 --> 48:17.657
Mike,

48:17.659 --> 48:19.392
when did you stop working?

48:19.394 --> 48:20.463
About two hours ago.

48:23.432 --> 48:25.302
Just gonna get some of that
cereal.

48:30.206 --> 48:32.639
Morning, all, so this
is our first full day

48:32.641 --> 48:34.075
in the asylum, yeah?

48:34.077 --> 48:36.010
So we're gonna have to
make the most of it,

48:36.012 --> 48:36.945
I'm probably gonna spend a lot
of time

48:36.947 --> 48:39.447
with Richard and Marcus, but
Mary is here

48:39.449 --> 48:41.682
if you need any guidance,
any kind of insight.

48:41.684 --> 48:43.617
And Steve, I'm just gonna
need you back and forth

48:43.619 --> 48:44.552
all day, mate, all day.

48:44.554 --> 48:46.220
Make sure everyone's got what
they need.

48:46.222 --> 48:47.454
Yep, sure.

48:47.456 --> 48:48.623
Okay, guys, first thing today
I wanna do the dining room,

48:48.625 --> 48:51.358
I wanna get some coverage to
play for the effects guys.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.726
All right?

48:52.728 --> 48:54.461
Let's go.

49:10.545 --> 49:12.213
Steve, can you take the
radios up to the safe room

49:12.215 --> 49:14.251
and change the batteries?

49:53.588 --> 49:55.655
Hey Mike.... Hey.

49:55.657 --> 49:57.193
So you wrapped for the day?

49:58.293 --> 49:59.996
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

50:01.197 --> 50:02.396
What's the matter?

50:02.398 --> 50:06.066
All right, I thought I saw
someone.

50:06.068 --> 50:08.836
But I had my glasses off at the
time

50:08.838 --> 50:13.240
so for all I know it
could've just been a curtain.

50:13.242 --> 50:14.809
Don't tell me that shit, man.

50:14.811 --> 50:17.014
This place freaks me out enough
as it is.

50:26.688 --> 50:29.091
Right, that's
the radios on charge.

50:29.791 --> 50:31.258
Shh!

50:35.197 --> 50:37.130
Go and get Leonard and Richard.

50:37.132 --> 50:38.833
Wait...... Just go!

50:38.835 --> 50:41.568
Okay, okay, okay.

50:41.570 --> 50:43.336
Yeah, well I slept
pretty well last night.

50:43.338 --> 50:45.572
Not as good as Leonard did, I'm
sure.

50:45.574 --> 50:47.576
Don't be bitter because
you didn't think ahead.

50:52.248 --> 50:55.182
Rich, Leonard, Mike needs you
now.

50:55.184 --> 50:56.450
What for?

50:56.452 --> 50:58.188
He didn't say but he needs
you.

50:58.887 --> 51:00.056
Now, come on!

51:05.728 --> 51:07.130
What's wrong?

51:11.434 --> 51:12.298
What the hell is that?

51:12.300 --> 51:14.235
I haven't got a clue.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.536
Well, what's on the cameras?

51:15.538 --> 51:18.238
Nothing, but we can't
have cameras everywhere.

51:18.240 --> 51:19.240
The microphones pick up a lot
more...

51:19.242 --> 51:22.412
What the hell is that?... I don't have a clue.

51:23.612 --> 51:24.878
Chester?

51:24.880 --> 51:26.750
It could just be kids
trespassing.

51:28.317 --> 51:29.650
Have we got cameras in
all the places we wanted?

51:29.652 --> 51:30.650
Yes.

51:30.652 --> 51:31.586
You've got
cameras upstairs, too?

51:31.588 --> 51:33.787
Yeah, I've got a
couple up there for you.

51:33.789 --> 51:34.889
Well did you see anything?

51:34.891 --> 51:36.693
No, nothing while I was
working.

51:38.293 --> 51:39.126
Well, just do us a
favor

51:39.128 --> 51:39.994
and keep an eye on things, will
you?

51:39.996 --> 51:41.729
Yeah, I'm gonna be here all
night.

51:41.731 --> 51:44.231
Yeah, well, you make sure
Steve gives you a break.

51:44.233 --> 51:45.166
Yeah, right.

51:45.168 --> 51:47.300
Steve, did you get those
radios charged?

51:47.302 --> 51:48.903
Yeah, they should be good to
go now.

51:48.905 --> 51:50.704
Okay Rich, you take
one and I'll take one

51:50.706 --> 51:53.507
and Mike you keep some here for
you, yeah?

51:53.509 --> 51:54.941
Are you sure
everything set up and online?

51:54.943 --> 51:57.510
We have eyes all over the
place.

51:57.512 --> 51:59.246
If anything happens we'll see
it.

51:59.248 --> 52:01.548
If anybody turns up we will see
them.

52:01.550 --> 52:04.385
Okay, if you see anything you
radio us.

52:04.387 --> 52:05.786
No problem.

52:11.561 --> 52:14.260
Do you really think it
was Chester that we heard?

52:14.262 --> 52:15.095
Maybe.

52:15.097 --> 52:16.930
What if he's watching us right
now?

52:16.932 --> 52:18.566
Watching everything we're doing.

52:18.568 --> 52:21.735
We have the cameras set
up, we're all here together,

52:21.737 --> 52:24.405
I'm sure we'll see him before he
sees us.

52:24.407 --> 52:25.838
This is one of those
times I have to question

52:25.840 --> 52:27.409
my career choice.

52:32.815 --> 52:34.847
Steve?... Yeah?

52:34.849 --> 52:36.249
One for you, they'll call you
on that

52:36.251 --> 52:37.284
if they need you, yeah?

52:37.286 --> 52:39.353
Channel two, yeah?... Cheers.

52:39.355 --> 52:40.222
Hey, boss,

52:41.657 --> 52:43.856
don't mind if I go for a quick
fag do you?

52:43.858 --> 52:46.929
No, I've given the keys to
Mike.

52:48.297 --> 52:49.463
If you keep it on and you're
quick, yeah,

52:49.465 --> 52:51.231
just jump in one of the next
rooms, yeah?

52:51.233 --> 52:51.902
Cheers.

54:46.414 --> 54:47.514
Oh for God's sake,

54:47.516 --> 54:50.487
every time I go to eat
something something happens.

56:35.990 --> 56:38.157
All I'm saying is if
the power goes out again,

56:38.159 --> 56:40.226
we're limited to running
night vision cameras

56:40.228 --> 56:41.961
that run off the batteries.

56:41.963 --> 56:43.130
Yeah.

56:44.233 --> 56:45.135
Smoke!

56:46.802 --> 56:47.670
Shit!

56:50.940 --> 56:52.005
Shit.

56:52.007 --> 56:56.976
Find something to put it
out, quickly, go, go, go!

56:56.978 --> 57:00.983
I've got a blanket!... I've got an extinguisher!

57:04.052 --> 57:05.087
Oh fuck, Mike.

57:10.092 --> 57:11.691
Who would do something like
this?

57:11.693 --> 57:13.594
I'm done.... We need to stay calm.

57:13.596 --> 57:15.431
Where are the keys?

57:16.931 --> 57:19.066
He must've left them in the
safe room.

57:19.068 --> 57:19.969
Shit, Steve!

57:21.103 --> 57:23.269
He's got a radio, get him
there.

57:23.271 --> 57:24.871
Steve?

57:24.873 --> 57:27.173
Leonard to Steve!

57:27.175 --> 57:28.177
For fuck's sake!

57:30.144 --> 57:31.945
We can't just leave
him there,

57:31.947 --> 57:34.146
we'll have to go get him.... What?

57:34.148 --> 57:35.081
We can't just leave him there!

57:35.083 --> 57:35.916
Yeah, Mary's right, I'll come
with you.

57:35.918 --> 57:37.918
You two go back to the safe
room,

57:37.920 --> 57:39.019
find the keys, lock yourselves
in,

57:39.021 --> 57:42.722
we'll come and get you, all
right?

57:59.641 --> 58:02.309
I knew it was a bad idea, I
should've listened to Megan.

58:02.311 --> 58:03.709
She's just a
kid, she's just worried

58:03.711 --> 58:05.144
about her dad, it's not your
fault.

58:05.146 --> 58:07.981
Mike came here
because of me.

58:07.983 --> 58:09.983
He came here
because he wanted to.

58:09.985 --> 58:12.151
What's important now is if
we all get out of here alive.

58:12.153 --> 58:15.492
This place is a
labyrinth.

58:19.862 --> 58:21.327
Are you okay?... I just need a moment.

58:21.329 --> 58:23.296
We don't have a moment!

58:23.298 --> 58:24.166
Chester!

58:44.786 --> 58:46.586
You seen this
before?

58:46.588 --> 58:49.990
No, I've not
seen this room before.

58:49.992 --> 58:52.862
Is it on the map?... I don't know.

58:54.128 --> 58:54.998
Steve!

59:14.083 --> 59:15.182
He can't get in, can he?... No, this is a safe room,

59:15.184 --> 59:17.851
this is what it's designed for.

59:25.927 --> 59:28.028
What's he doing?

59:28.030 --> 59:28.965
I have no idea.

59:33.235 --> 59:34.637
Are they the...... Keys.

59:35.971 --> 59:36.838
Oh shit!

01:00:06.402 --> 01:00:08.003
Jesus Christ, Steve.

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:10.273
Oh, fuck.

01:00:11.806 --> 01:00:13.673
This is getting way to much,
Lenny,

01:00:13.675 --> 01:00:15.409
he was just a kid.... Oh, shit.

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.347
We need to get out of here
right now.

01:00:19.313 --> 01:00:20.746
Where are they?

01:00:20.748 --> 01:00:22.117
I don't know, I don't see
them.

01:00:27.021 --> 01:00:29.255
Wait, there they are.

01:00:29.257 --> 01:00:30.225
Is that Steve?

01:00:31.326 --> 01:00:32.260
He's killed him.

01:00:33.195 --> 01:00:35.295
... Oh my god.

01:00:35.297 --> 01:00:37.396
The fuck is going on, we're all
gonna die.

01:00:37.398 --> 01:00:39.865
No, we're getting out of here
alive.

01:00:39.867 --> 01:00:40.666
How?

01:00:40.668 --> 01:00:41.534
That fucking lunatic has the
keys

01:00:41.536 --> 01:00:42.202
and he knows this place inside
and out

01:00:42.204 --> 01:00:43.068
and we're just sitting here!

01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.174
I don't know but we will find
a way.

01:00:47.342 --> 01:00:48.311
Chester!

01:00:55.217 --> 01:00:56.818
Richard, Leonard, it's Mary!

01:00:57.786 --> 01:00:59.720
It's Chester, he's the one
behind this

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:01.387
and he's got the keys!

01:01:01.389 --> 01:01:02.488
What?... Say again.

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:05.325
He's got the keys and he's
headed straight for you!

01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:06.927
This isn't good.

01:01:13.335 --> 01:01:14.434
I think we need to find a
weapon.

01:01:14.436 --> 01:01:16.372
What?... Find a weapon.

01:01:17.405 --> 01:01:19.106
If that bastard's coming
we need to get a weapon,

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.206
we need to be ready to fight.

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:22.008
Don't think we'll be much
of a match for that guy.

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:23.943
Find a goddamn weapon!

01:01:37.092 --> 01:01:38.224
Look, whatever you're doing,
do it fast,

01:01:38.226 --> 01:01:40.159
he's coming straight for you.

01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:43.262
Find somewhere to hide, we
need to get a jump on him.

01:02:21.503 --> 01:02:22.371
Leonard!

01:02:24.972 --> 01:02:28.210
... Richard!

01:03:02.143 --> 01:03:04.513
That's it, we're fucked,
we're all going to die.

01:03:11.452 --> 01:03:13.320
Typical, no signal.

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:15.322
We're gonna die in this tiny
little room and for what?

01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:17.289
A fucking documentary?

01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:19.391
As long as we're in
this room, we're safe.

01:03:19.393 --> 01:03:20.492
So we just stay in here
forever?

01:03:20.494 --> 01:03:22.061
No, we find a way out.

01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:31.371
He's out there and
without all the cameras,

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:33.039
there's no way of us knowing
where he is.

01:03:33.041 --> 01:03:34.641
We can't get out of here
without him knowing!

01:03:34.643 --> 01:03:36.208
Look, I don't know
how we get out of here

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:37.911
but we have to try.

01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:48.217
Mary.

01:04:49.318 --> 01:04:51.016
Marcus, are you there?

01:04:51.018 --> 01:04:53.019
Richard, is that you?... Yeah.

01:04:53.021 --> 01:04:54.090
Are you okay, buddy?

01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:57.460
I'm not in a good way.

01:04:59.393 --> 01:05:01.561
We need to get outta here.

01:05:01.563 --> 01:05:03.398
We're trying, can you
walk?

01:05:04.599 --> 01:05:05.468
Barely.

01:05:07.168 --> 01:05:10.373
I managed to get the keys off
Chester

01:05:11.306 --> 01:05:14.039
but he's gonna find out pretty
soon.

01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:16.675
Okay, stay there,
we're coming to get you.

01:05:16.677 --> 01:05:17.545
Hurry.

01:05:24.052 --> 01:05:26.322
What do we do?... I don't know, let me think.

01:05:29.224 --> 01:05:30.657
One of us has to distract
Chester

01:05:30.659 --> 01:05:32.361
while the other one gets
Richard.

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:37.197
Why can't we just stay
together?

01:05:37.199 --> 01:05:39.264
Because that room is a dead
end,

01:05:39.266 --> 01:05:41.467
we both go in there and we're
trapped.

01:05:41.469 --> 01:05:44.070
One of us needs to make sure
that he doesn't get in there.

01:05:44.072 --> 01:05:45.141
No, it's suicide.

01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:48.141
There's no other way.... I don't know.

01:05:48.143 --> 01:05:50.744
Look, if you've got a
better idea then I'm all ears.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.751
All right, I'll distract
him, you get Richard.

01:05:58.753 --> 01:06:01.420
No, I'll distract him, you get
Richard.

01:06:01.422 --> 01:06:03.690
No way, I'll do it!... It was my idea.

01:06:03.692 --> 01:06:06.094
I'm pretty fast and I
think I can outrun him.

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:10.496
Okay, if you're sure.

01:06:10.498 --> 01:06:13.233
Just go get Richard and
meet us back in the main hall.

01:06:13.235 --> 01:06:15.501
And you?... I'll meet you there.

01:06:15.503 --> 01:06:17.172
And if you don't?

01:06:18.239 --> 01:06:20.642
Just make sure you get help.

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:28.775
You good?

01:07:28.777 --> 01:07:29.876
I don't know if I can do this.

01:07:29.878 --> 01:07:32.114
You got this, I trust you.

01:07:33.447 --> 01:07:37.318
Mary, don't fuck this up.... Go get Richard, okay?

01:07:38.719 --> 01:07:40.186
Let's do this.

01:07:55.871 --> 01:07:56.739
Chester!

01:08:02.744 --> 01:08:03.612
Chester!

01:08:14.389 --> 01:08:15.257
Chester!

01:08:25.432 --> 01:08:27.366
Rich, buddy.... You came to get me.

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:29.801
Sure I did and we're gonna
get you out of here, yeah?

01:08:29.804 --> 01:08:32.272
Where's Mary?... She's looking for Chester.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.272
What, why?

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:34.540
That doesn't matter
right now, what matters

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:36.910
is that we get you out of here.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:39.344
Okay.

01:08:39.345 --> 01:08:40.746
Just give me a minute.

01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:42.182
Listen, I don't know
how many of those we have,

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.515
we need to get moving now.

01:08:43.518 --> 01:08:46.122
Okay, just, can you grab
me that piece of wood?

01:08:52.493 --> 01:08:57.500
One, two, three!

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:36.568
Mary, it's Marcus, are you
there?

01:11:10.798 --> 01:11:11.998
Mary!... Hurry!

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Where's Chester?... He's right behind me!

01:11:14.002 --> 01:11:15.701
I can't run!

01:11:15.703 --> 01:11:18.004
I'll help, we've gotta
get down the stairs!

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.967
Marcus, are you okay?

01:11:47.969 --> 01:11:50.870
Is he alive?... I don't think so.

01:11:50.872 --> 01:11:54.139
What about Chester?... Same.

01:11:54.141 --> 01:11:57.378
We need to get out of here, come
on.

01:12:05.987 --> 01:12:06.855
Go, now!

01:12:27.475 --> 01:12:28.610
Take the keys!

01:13:57.131 --> 01:13:58.801
What the hell happened here?

01:14:01.034 --> 01:14:03.635
The girl that survived said
that one guy

01:14:03.637 --> 01:14:05.771
murdered all of them.... Why?

01:14:05.773 --> 01:14:06.873
She doesn't know.

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.644
Did she say what he looked
like?

01:14:10.244 --> 01:14:11.943
Yep.

01:14:11.945 --> 01:14:16.249
Tall, male, beard, face mask,

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:19.050
had with him a bat with nails in
it.

01:14:19.052 --> 01:14:21.687
... Not Lockhart!

01:14:21.689 --> 01:14:24.190
Would sound like it.... Sounds like bullshit.

01:14:24.192 --> 01:14:27.727
She seemed legit, she was
part of a documentary film crew.

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:30.795
Did they film anything that
could be used as evidence?

01:14:30.797 --> 01:14:34.000
Doesn't seem like it,
tech crew had a quick look.

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:36.268
So far nothing but static.... Static?

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:38.004
Yep, static.

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:39.638
Well they can't be
that good at filmmaking

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.074
if they only managed to film
static.

01:14:43.144 --> 01:14:45.981
Any sign of him or anything
you guys might find?

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.049
Nope.

01:14:49.016 --> 01:14:50.085
Not a trace.

01:14:51.719 --> 01:14:53.152
He's like a fucking specter.

01:14:53.154 --> 01:14:56.492
Same description every
time, never a fucking trace.

01:15:02.930 --> 01:15:05.164
That guy looks really messed
up.

01:15:05.166 --> 01:15:07.666
Yeah, he's the only other
survivor.

01:15:07.668 --> 01:15:08.871
They think he'll make it.

01:15:16.911 --> 01:15:18.678
How much was there?

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.048
I'm sorry?... Footage, how much was there?

01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:26.654
Approximately 18
hours, the tech guy said.

01:15:30.057 --> 01:15:31.792
18 hours of static.
