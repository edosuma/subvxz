E. R.

00:04.062 --> 00:05.063
Previously on E. R.

00:05.144 --> 00:07.396
I have a baby
with an amphetamine overdose.

00:07.497 --> 00:09.735
- Joyce, you in there?
- I'm calling the police.

00:09.736 --> 00:10.536
No.

00:10.580 --> 00:13.518
- I'm trying to help a sick child.
- Mom, he has leukemia.

00:13.619 --> 00:14.739
He may not survive.

00:14.840 --> 00:17.449
If you've got some kind of twisted need
to relive this, that's fine.

00:17.450 --> 00:20.417
I'm not gonna do it again.
I made my peace a long time ago.

00:20.418 --> 00:21.809
What the hell happened?

00:22.173 --> 00:23.841
She swallowed Rachel's Ecstasy.

00:23.842 --> 00:25.653
- She could still die!
- I know, Dad!

00:25.754 --> 00:27.649
Please, please, Dad. I'm sorry!

00:27.750 --> 00:31.266
I don't understand
why this has happened.

E. R. 8x14 "A SIMPLE TWIST OF FATE"

00:51.260 --> 00:53.503
Dr. Lewis, you need to get up.

00:54.181 --> 00:55.510
- Dr. Lewis!
- What?

00:55.683 --> 00:57.427
You need to get up.

00:59.397 --> 01:01.390
- What time is it?
- Almost 7.

01:02.485 --> 01:05.652
Oh, my God, I was just gonna
lie down for a second.

01:05.864 --> 01:08.356
- When was that?
30.

01:13.291 --> 01:14.536
I need to get home.

01:14.752 --> 01:17.243
Animal attack from the zoo in 15 to 20.

01:17.422 --> 01:19.997
- Oh, no. I'm not on till noon.
- Weaver needs you now.

01:20.176 --> 01:22.715
Yeah, and I need a hot shower
and some mouthwash.

01:23.139 --> 01:24.716
Dr. Greene is still up in the PICU.

01:24.891 --> 01:28.225
Someone has to cover him. You
happened to be curled up in the lounge.

01:28.396 --> 01:29.890
- Is she extubated?
- His daughter?

01:30.065 --> 01:32.023
- Yeah.
- They're waiting on a blood gas.

01:32.192 --> 01:33.521
- She triggering the vent?
- No.

01:33.695 --> 01:35.984
- Did Neurology read the EEG?
- I don't know.

01:36.115 --> 01:39.070
- I said, no!
- We're talking bagels and cream cheese.

01:39.244 --> 01:41.072
No one is taking a bribe.

01:41.247 --> 01:44.451
Promotions like this add to
the cost of pharmaceuticals.

01:44.627 --> 01:47.914
Marketing expenditures passed on
to mostly elderly consumers.

01:48.090 --> 01:49.288
I'm elderly.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.875
- There's no free lunch, Frank.
- This is breakfast.

01:52.054 --> 01:56.184
Yes. This is Susan Lewis in the ER.
I need to speak with the charge nurse.

01:56.351 --> 01:59.639
They weaned her down to 30 percent,
she's off sedation...

01:59.815 --> 02:02.354
...and the PICU fellow
ordered a CPAP trial.

02:02.528 --> 02:05.280
Oh, thanks. Never mind.

02:05.489 --> 02:08.064
I'll take the rack.
You clear the pass-ons...

02:08.285 --> 02:10.324
and get this borborygmi out of 4.

02:10.497 --> 02:13.167
You wanna ask me to cover all day
after staying all night?

02:13.334 --> 02:16.123
All night was your choice.
Welcome to management.

02:16.297 --> 02:18.836
- No whining allowed.
- You sleep with your eyelids open.

02:19.008 --> 02:21.382
- Partly open.
- Still...

02:21.554 --> 02:22.883
...kind of freaky.

02:23.056 --> 02:26.723
Not as freaky as watching you eat
with your mouth open. Any strawberry?

02:26.895 --> 02:29.054
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Looking for a knife.

02:29.231 --> 02:32.103
- Next to the penlights.
- All right. You're gonna eat that?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.530
Why not?

02:34.697 --> 02:38.946
The next time you get a pneumonitis
and you have to prescribe Reprotrex...

02:39.120 --> 02:43.749
...or the cheaper, effective generic drug,
you're not gonna feel slightly beholden?

02:44.336 --> 02:45.617
By a bagel? No.

02:45.796 --> 02:47.422
Are you sure?

02:48.383 --> 02:52.465
Okay. I'm gonna go to Doc Magoo's,
get some breakfast, find a toothbrush...

02:52.639 --> 02:55.392
...change my underwear,
and then I'll clear your borborygmi.

02:55.561 --> 02:56.592
Fifteen minutes.

02:56.770 --> 03:00.807
If I stick with the underwear I've got on,
can we at least keep the food out?

03:03.029 --> 03:05.865
It's all right. It's all right.

03:06.867 --> 03:09.407
You can't titrate a little Versed
so she won't remember?

03:09.579 --> 03:12.416
Any benzo
decreases her ventilatory drive.

03:13.252 --> 03:14.628
Then do it.

03:14.795 --> 03:17.714
But if you allow the sedation to
wear off, you have to be ready.

03:17.883 --> 03:22.049
I need to warn you. Extubation's a leap
of faith with little ones. I can't do a NIF.

03:22.222 --> 03:25.391
PEEP's under two, CO-2 is normal.

03:26.395 --> 03:28.935
- Let's go.
- Okay.

03:29.191 --> 03:32.691
Have the ambu bag ready.
Disconnecting the vent.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.524
And tape is clear.

03:39.247 --> 03:41.952
And tube. Suction.

03:42.751 --> 03:45.161
All right, come on, Ella.

03:45.422 --> 03:47.297
Big cough. Big cough.

03:47.467 --> 03:48.712
She's not breathing.

03:49.803 --> 03:53.339
Blow by O-2. Give her time.
Give her time.

03:53.725 --> 03:57.226
Break open the airway box.
Draw up a milligram of midazolam.

03:57.940 --> 03:59.732
Come on, Ella.

04:02.529 --> 04:04.357
- Positive pressure now.
- No, wait.

04:10.749 --> 04:12.244
That's a happy sound.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.753
We're here. We're here. It's all right.

04:20.387 --> 04:21.616
Yeah, we're here.

05:11.677 --> 05:13.136
Is his car still there?

05:13.804 --> 05:18.097
Sometimes he skips Marketing,
but he won't skip Cost Accounting.

05:19.892 --> 05:22.430
If you wanna wait,
I can be there when you do it.

05:22.603 --> 05:26.517
No. I'm gonna ask him at school. He'll
stay calm in front of his study group.

05:26.690 --> 05:29.359
- You can't ask him, Joyce.
- Right. I know.

05:29.859 --> 05:33.809
- And you have to leave if he doesn't-
- I know. I know.

05:36.824 --> 05:38.816
Do you wanna come to work with me?

05:39.076 --> 05:42.325
- Can I stay here until he leaves?
- Of course.

05:45.164 --> 05:47.203
Call me after you talk to him.

05:47.916 --> 05:49.411
Abby.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.709
These groups, they really work? He
only lasted two sessions in counseling.

05:54.881 --> 05:56.292
- Joyce-
- I know.

05:56.466 --> 05:58.692
I wanna try and help him.
It's worth a try.

05:58.727 --> 06:00.668
You can go back to him if he gets better,

06:00.928 --> 06:02.884
or file a complaint and a judge can-

06:02.971 --> 06:05.640
He'll do this. If he knows I'm serious,
he'll do this for me.

06:08.684 --> 06:10.427
- Call me.
- Thanks, Abby.

06:11.395 --> 06:12.973
Lock the door.

06:20.611 --> 06:22.071
Abby?

06:22.238 --> 06:23.696
You seen Joyce?

06:23.948 --> 06:27.151
- Abby, my wife. You seen her?
- What? No.

06:27.368 --> 06:29.241
She didn't come home.
I'm getting worried.

06:29.745 --> 06:31.736
- She didn't call you?
- No.

06:32.121 --> 06:33.366
Did you call the police?

06:34.332 --> 06:37.499
No. We had a fight.
She might just be mad at me.

06:38.794 --> 06:40.833
If you hear from her, have her call me?

06:40.963 --> 06:41.993
Yeah, sure.

06:42.798 --> 06:44.873
Thanks. Have a good day.

06:49.137 --> 06:50.381
She's moving extremities?

06:50.554 --> 06:52.594
All four. Fixing and following.
Good color.

06:52.764 --> 06:54.092
Oh, Mark, that's great.

06:54.266 --> 06:57.101
No seizure in the next 48 hours,
we should be home free.

06:57.269 --> 06:58.300
What's that for?

06:58.478 --> 07:01.513
The breast pump up in OB
is missing a collection tube.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.764
- She's eating?
- She's about to try.

07:03.941 --> 07:05.020
Thank you for covering.

07:05.109 --> 07:07.101
Don't worry. Take care of your daughter.

07:07.277 --> 07:10.610
Positive LOC.
Now GCS 13, postictal.

07:10.781 --> 07:12.109
This is the zoo trauma?

07:12.281 --> 07:14.653
- Yeah. He got bit by a monkey.
- It was a sloth.

07:14.826 --> 07:16.818
- What is a sloth?
- It's like a monkey.

07:16.994 --> 07:19.235
No, it's not.
They're not anything like primates.

07:19.413 --> 07:21.986
- They're not even in the same order.
- Dr. Greene?

07:22.665 --> 07:24.124
I hear your baby's doing better.

07:24.542 --> 07:26.748
- Off the vent.
- Oh, good. That's really good news.

07:26.878 --> 07:28.040
So far.

07:28.588 --> 07:32.667
- I didn't file a H-5122 with the chart.
- A what?

07:32.841 --> 07:35.130
Mandatory reporting
of illegal substance abuse.

07:35.301 --> 07:36.760
Oh, right.

07:37.094 --> 07:39.503
I just wasn't sure.
I thought maybe you'd want to-

07:39.680 --> 07:41.388
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

07:56.237 --> 08:00.281
Sometimes it takes a little longer
during shift change.

08:00.448 --> 08:01.693
Shift change?

08:01.867 --> 08:05.234
When one nurse goes home,
another comes on?

08:05.661 --> 08:07.286
Oh, right.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.114
I'll go get her.

08:09.873 --> 08:11.782
- Etoposide?
- Two-CdA.

08:11.958 --> 08:14.580
- He'll piggyback in the second phase.
- Hey.

08:14.753 --> 08:17.918
His IV has run out,
and there's an alarm going off.

08:18.089 --> 08:21.706
It's only a pretreatment solution. The
nurse will change it when they move him.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.801
- Move him?
- To the treatment room.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.009
His cells are
almost 100 percent leukemic.

08:27.180 --> 08:29.753
He'll need a second
chemo induction now.

08:30.058 --> 08:33.841
- And then a bone marrow transplant.
- He's already failed one.

08:34.020 --> 08:36.722
Another one's gonna make him
sicker and be more dangerous.

08:37.054 --> 08:40.802
- Chemotherapy alone is gonna save him?
- Maybe.

08:40.972 --> 08:43.759
He's gonna get a set of drugs
he didn't get before.

08:44.475 --> 08:48.604
- You've decided to experiment on him?
- I haven't decided anything.

08:50.273 --> 08:53.806
Look, it's as much luck as science
involved at this point.

08:54.150 --> 08:56.771
- You look like you need a rest.
- No.

08:57.153 --> 09:01.197
You're gonna pump that junk back into
his veins, I'm gonna stay right here.

09:11.122 --> 09:14.869
I meant to get the ring sized smaller,
but I didn't get the chance.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.124
How did you swallow it?

09:17.293 --> 09:19.202
He likes me to suck on his fingers.

09:20.213 --> 09:21.587
I see.

09:21.964 --> 09:24.834
Nothing to panic about.
It should pass in two or three days.

09:25.049 --> 09:26.840
- "Pass"?
- Two or three days?

09:27.009 --> 09:30.508
She'll be fine. Add some fiber to your
diet and let nature take its course.

09:30.762 --> 09:32.138
He's not worried about me.

09:32.305 --> 09:35.554
He's afraid his wife'll notice
his wedding ring is missing.

09:36.892 --> 09:39.845
- There's nothing we can do?
- Well, I could try an endoscopy.

09:40.019 --> 09:41.513
I don't like the sound of that.

09:41.687 --> 09:44.309
- We stick a tube down your throat-
- I gotta get to work.

09:44.481 --> 09:45.726
Honey, I need my ring!

09:45.900 --> 09:48.271
Well, I need my job.
I'm on stage in an hour.

09:48.442 --> 09:50.849
I gotta get to work.
And I ain't searching my stool.

09:51.027 --> 09:53.104
Abby's ready for that vag bleed in 1.

09:53.279 --> 09:55.604
- I got Registry to fill in for me.
- You're leaving?

09:56.032 --> 09:58.700
I'm on my second dose of Compazine.
I'm still puking.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.527
- Five hundred?
- Hey.

10:00.702 --> 10:04.070
How much would you charge
to stick a tube down your throat?

10:05.789 --> 10:08.113
You two negotiate.
I'll be right back.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.575
Frank, are you sick too?

10:13.170 --> 10:14.545
I ain't praying!

10:18.548 --> 10:21.170
- How many pads?
- Two so far. Started bleeding yesterday.

10:21.343 --> 10:25.257
Hi, Valerie, I'm Dr. Lewis.
When was your last period?

10:25.429 --> 10:28.216
- Two months ago.
- Do you think you could be pregnant?

10:28.391 --> 10:31.390
My parents would freak.
My older sister just had a baby.

10:31.559 --> 10:34.512
Abby, line two. It's your neighbor.

10:35.145 --> 10:37.601
Just relax. I need to take a look,
all right?

10:37.939 --> 10:39.729
- Joyce?
- How old is your sister?

10:39.899 --> 10:42.520
- Eighteen.
- Okay, wait. What? Hold on. Hold on.

10:43.569 --> 10:44.979
What?

10:47.071 --> 10:52.065
Okay. Come here, and I'll give you
my key and-

10:55.620 --> 10:57.244
Do you have a coat on?

10:57.454 --> 11:01.203
- Maybe she's not hungry.
- She hasn't had anything in 12 hours.

11:01.374 --> 11:03.781
Come on. Come on, Ella.
Come on.

11:03.960 --> 11:08.087
- We could put a little TPN in her line.
- Hey, there.

11:08.255 --> 11:10.461
There. She's taking it.

11:10.632 --> 11:13.204
Yeah, you're hungry, aren't you? Yeah.

11:13.383 --> 11:15.459
Dr. Greene,
your daughter's on the phone.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.634
I'll call her back.

11:18.346 --> 11:20.054
Where is she?

11:20.223 --> 11:23.008
Home. Katherine stayed over.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.805
- Did they charge her with anything?
- Who?

11:27.269 --> 11:28.894
The police.

11:29.062 --> 11:30.473
No.

11:31.106 --> 11:32.931
Well, what did they do?

11:35.776 --> 11:38.348
You didn't tell them, did you?

11:38.820 --> 11:41.524
I wasn't the Attending physician.

11:41.697 --> 11:44.054
Mark, she was in possession
of a controlled substance...

11:44.089 --> 11:46.405
...that could've killed our daughter.

11:47.118 --> 11:49.443
She wasn't trying to hurt her.

11:50.204 --> 11:53.619
It was three pills. I don't think they're
gonna waste a lot of time on it.

11:53.789 --> 11:55.497
- Waste time?
- You know what I mean.

11:55.666 --> 11:57.457
You're already making excuses for her.

11:57.626 --> 12:00.959
- No, I'm not.
- You're not doing anything, are you?

12:02.631 --> 12:04.788
What would you like me to do?

12:06.132 --> 12:07.876
You want me to have her arrested?

12:08.050 --> 12:10.967
You think she should go to juvenile hall?
Would that be better?

12:11.137 --> 12:13.426
Do something.
You haven't even called her mother.

12:13.597 --> 12:16.597
- Well, I've been a little busy-
- There's a phone!

12:17.016 --> 12:19.803
- She's in court all day.
- No. No, you're avoiding.

12:19.977 --> 12:22.514
Even now you're refusing
to deal with a problem...

12:22.688 --> 12:25.143
...you should have handled
way before this happened!

12:25.314 --> 12:28.433
- Are you blaming me for this?
- Oh, damn it!

12:28.901 --> 12:30.644
Her stomach's just upset.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.807
Trauma 2. Have fun.

12:32.977 --> 12:35.016
I'm going home before it
comes out both ends.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.643
- Who's working the desk?
- Personnel is sending a temp.

12:37.814 --> 12:39.143
I'm already down four nurses.

12:39.316 --> 12:43.527
Abby is coming back, but this is gonna
get worse before it gets better.

12:43.695 --> 12:46.316
Anybody who ate those bagels and
that cream cheese is gonna blow chunks.

12:46.405 --> 12:49.157
I ate one of those bagels.

12:50.701 --> 12:54.484
I'll add your name
to the class-action suit.

13:00.335 --> 13:04.545
Oh, my God! Joyce, I thought you said
you were just locked out.

13:04.838 --> 13:08.289
He came back.
He left and then he came back.

13:08.467 --> 13:09.711
Where are your shoes?

13:09.884 --> 13:12.375
I just ran. I hid down the street
until he left again.

13:12.553 --> 13:13.964
Okay, let me see.

13:15.807 --> 13:18.344
Can you just let me inside?
It's freezing out here.

13:18.517 --> 13:20.391
- We need to go to the hospital.
- I'm okay.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.805
No. I have to get an x-ray.

13:22.395 --> 13:26.137
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- Yes, it is. Your cheekbone's broken.

13:27.506 --> 13:29.795
Pulse ox is 82 on 2 liters.

13:29.967 --> 13:33.088
- Oh, no. Not you too.
- Yeah. I had the garlic.

13:33.263 --> 13:35.256
No breath sounds on the left.
Chest tube.

13:35.432 --> 13:36.677
Am I dying?

13:36.851 --> 13:39.424
- The icicle collapsed your lung.
- Pressure's down to 70.

13:39.603 --> 13:41.929
- God! This is it.
- Squeeze in 2 liters of saline.

13:42.107 --> 13:43.850
I'm gonna use a tube to re-inflate it.

13:44.026 --> 13:46.778
I reached Dr. Kovac.
Mark's coming down until he gets here.

13:46.946 --> 13:49.069
- No, we can handle this.
- I have to go home.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.278
If I'm working a double,
you're not stiffing me after a few hours.

13:52.453 --> 13:55.324
- No, I really have to go home.
- Wait. Wait!

13:55.499 --> 13:57.123
You ate the bagels?

13:57.292 --> 14:01.041
- It's a teaching hospital.
- I'd still prefer you to do it.

14:03.007 --> 14:05.713
What's your mom doing in there?
I thought he was an orphan.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.678
You should at least be supervising her.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.720
I can see her from here.

14:10.058 --> 14:13.012
John, something's wrong,
he's coughing up blood!

14:13.187 --> 14:15.678
They gave him a blood thinner.
Hemoptysis is normal.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.182
- This isn't normal.
- Did you hit the lung?

14:18.359 --> 14:19.938
No. I slipped it in the subclavian.

14:20.111 --> 14:22.188
Pulse ox is 95.
Let's bring him to 2 liters.

14:22.364 --> 14:25.116
- Is he thrombocytopenic?
- Thirty thousand this morning.

14:25.285 --> 14:28.784
- Pretty low for a central line.
- They transfused him after the treatment.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.198
Please stop debating this and help him!

14:33.002 --> 14:35.872
- What do his coags look like?
- He got platelets, cryo and FFP.

14:36.047 --> 14:37.875
- He's in pain. Help him.
- Morphine?

14:38.259 --> 14:40.715
Pressure's low already.
I don't wanna bottom him out.

14:40.886 --> 14:44.054
- You can always give him more blood.
- Sure. Blood in, blood out.

14:45.976 --> 14:50.106
Let's page Dr. Neiser. CBC, PT, PTT,
portable chest and a blood gas.

14:50.273 --> 14:53.477
And call the blood bank. Have them
prep another 10-pack of platelets.

14:53.652 --> 14:55.278
And an x-ray.
Let's check placement.

14:55.446 --> 14:59.065
How are you doing there, Mick?
Are you having any trouble breathing?

15:03.415 --> 15:04.826
Mom?

15:05.125 --> 15:07.747
Mom, what are you doing?

15:07.920 --> 15:10.246
I can't. Please take care of him.

15:10.423 --> 15:12.547
I'm only here because
you asked for my help.

15:12.717 --> 15:15.921
I can't see him in that kind of pain.
Not again.

15:16.096 --> 15:18.054
- What did you expect?
- I don't know.

15:18.224 --> 15:20.217
You can't get this kid's
hopes up and leave!

15:21.645 --> 15:22.676
You're gonna do this?

15:22.854 --> 15:25.394
You're gonna drag me back
and bail when it gets tough?

15:26.067 --> 15:29.816
The kid doesn't think he has to
do this alone again! Don't leave him!

15:29.988 --> 15:31.530
Thank you.

15:35.328 --> 15:39.279
She was at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Shortness of breath and wheezing.

15:39.458 --> 15:41.118
Ariel, are you allergic to any food?

15:41.294 --> 15:43.536
- Did you give epi?
- It got worse as we pulled up.

15:43.714 --> 15:46.383
- Go upstairs. I got this.
- I saw the board. You're buried.

15:46.550 --> 15:47.630
I'll close to trauma.

15:47.718 --> 15:49.129
It's bad enough you got my shift.

15:49.304 --> 15:50.964
- It's not a problem.
- Slide her over.

15:51.973 --> 15:55.473
Are you sure that you've never had
any asthma or trouble breathing before?

15:55.645 --> 15:58.101
Put her on a pulse ox
and get Respiratory down here.

15:58.648 --> 16:01.056
- What were you eating?
- Shrimp and lobster.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.934
- Shrimp and lobster?
- Where do you keep pulse ox cables?

16:04.113 --> 16:06.071
- Second drawer.
- Did you eat a lot?

16:07.493 --> 16:11.241
Fifty of Benadryl, 125 of Sol...

16:12.957 --> 16:13.989
Solu-Medrol?

16:15.252 --> 16:16.663
Yeah. IV, now.

16:16.837 --> 16:20.752
And let's get a crash cart ready.
6.5 ET and a two-mac.

16:20.926 --> 16:22.254
No, really, Mark.
I got this.

16:22.427 --> 16:24.504
Ella's doing great, okay?
She's sleeping.

16:25.055 --> 16:27.179
- I need the distraction.
- They're not here.

16:27.350 --> 16:28.761
Well, then try next door.

16:28.935 --> 16:32.186
She's not moving air.
Get her on a nebulizer. Push 1 cc...

16:32.356 --> 16:34.016
Where are the pulse ox cables?

16:34.191 --> 16:35.852
- Who are you?
- Registry.

16:36.027 --> 16:38.186
Outside, third supply cart to the left.

16:40.533 --> 16:44.068
Most of the time, we totally click.
We totally get each other.

16:44.287 --> 16:45.948
- He makes me laugh.
- Okay, sit back.

16:46.122 --> 16:49.040
- He's considerate.
- Okay, that's good.

16:49.210 --> 16:54.372
Other days, he's just a different person.
He becomes a different person.

16:57.220 --> 16:58.500
Chin up.

16:58.805 --> 17:00.963
And then I become a different person.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.175
I know he's all the same man,
it's just...

17:04.604 --> 17:07.855
- Hard to walk away from the good part.
- You have to hold still.

17:09.108 --> 17:13.737
Ninety-five percent of the time,
he's my best friend, my husband.

17:14.574 --> 17:17.825
- That's hard to walk away from.
- Well...

17:18.579 --> 17:20.738
...it looks like he answered
your ultimatum.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.074
I didn't have a chance to give it.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.124
I think he answered it all the same.

17:27.423 --> 17:29.915
Yeah, well, how long is that gonna take?

17:31.220 --> 17:34.470
Look, this isn't just any patient,
this is my daughter.

17:36.684 --> 17:40.730
Call another neurologist if you have to,
I want that EEG read.

17:50.910 --> 17:52.108
She smiled at me.

17:53.121 --> 17:56.206
That's good, right? She's smiling?

17:57.835 --> 18:01.086
Yes. That's good.

18:05.970 --> 18:08.640
I was thinking about taking one
at a party.

18:09.099 --> 18:11.768
They were in my bag.
I forgot about it.

18:17.317 --> 18:18.563
I'm so sorry.

18:21.406 --> 18:24.656
- Nothing I can do can make it right.
- You can leave.

18:26.203 --> 18:29.655
You can pack up your things
and leave my house.

18:33.421 --> 18:35.912
- I have to call my mom.
- Then call her.

18:47.813 --> 18:49.889
Dr. Lewis, I need a facial-lac repair in 2.

18:49.982 --> 18:51.013
Simple or complex?

18:51.109 --> 18:54.027
She's gonna need a couple sub-Q,
and I'm waiting on a facial series.

18:54.195 --> 18:57.363
Okay. Send her over to CT
and clear this hallway.

18:57.533 --> 19:00.071
Why is there a pregnant woman
squatting in the hallway?

19:00.245 --> 19:01.621
- Susan?
- I need you to see her.

19:01.788 --> 19:03.532
Yeah. One second.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.330
- Who's running the desk?
- That's Bouser, from Accounting.

19:06.502 --> 19:07.913
Of course. That makes sense.

19:08.087 --> 19:09.962
She's never been allergic to anything.

19:10.048 --> 19:12.919
Shellfish allergies come suddenly.
Especially in large amounts.

19:13.094 --> 19:15.502
This is Dr. Lewis.
I'll be right back.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.350
- She's still wheezing.
- Dad, I talked to Mom.

19:19.101 --> 19:22.517
And Mom will buy the tickets,
you just have to drive me to the airport.

19:22.689 --> 19:25.690
- Slow down. No one wants you to leave.
- Elizabeth does.

19:25.859 --> 19:27.899
You just gotta give her space
for a few days.

19:28.070 --> 19:30.562
- Once everything's okay with-
- She told me to leave.

19:30.949 --> 19:33.737
- You talked to her?
- Upstairs. She wants me out.

19:34.953 --> 19:37.243
You caught her at a bad time.
I'll talk to her.

19:37.415 --> 19:40.250
No, it's okay, Dad. I understand.
She's not my mother.

19:40.419 --> 19:42.328
She cares about Ella,
and I hurt her baby.

19:42.504 --> 19:44.912
I don't wanna cause more trouble.
I should just go.

19:45.091 --> 19:46.751
You're not going anywhere, Rachel.

19:46.926 --> 19:49.334
Mom says I should go
if Elizabeth doesn't want me.

19:49.513 --> 19:51.921
Your mom's not here and she doesn't-

19:53.310 --> 19:55.017
Are you okay?

19:57.439 --> 19:59.896
Just go home, and we'll
figure this out tonight, okay?

20:00.068 --> 20:02.559
- Dad?
- Rachel, please, now? Now.

20:02.737 --> 20:04.280
How long has she been overweight?

20:04.448 --> 20:08.494
Just recently, she put on 15 pounds
in the last couple months or so.

20:08.661 --> 20:11.616
I can send a nutritionist to come
speak with you if you'd like.

20:11.790 --> 20:14.282
Yes, please. I can't seem
to stop her from eating.

20:14.460 --> 20:15.919
We'll move her to another room.

20:16.087 --> 20:18.626
We'll monitor her breathing
for the next couple hours.

20:18.799 --> 20:21.255
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. I'll be right back.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.429
Hey, what happened?

20:26.599 --> 20:27.975
Oh, I bit my tongue.

20:28.144 --> 20:30.635
You did a really good job.
How's Rachel?

20:30.813 --> 20:32.641
- I don't know.
- Let me see.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.643
No. I just need to keep pressure on it.

20:34.985 --> 20:36.978
Come on.
Stick your tongue out.

20:38.657 --> 20:40.863
It's on the right.
I can't see if you do that.

20:41.035 --> 20:42.577
- Do what?
- Stick it out straight.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.662
I did.

20:49.502 --> 20:51.081
What?

20:53.675 --> 20:57.036
Well, it's not so bad.
Just keep applying pressure.

21:56.846 --> 21:59.220
- You didn't call for backup?
- That's what you are.

21:59.392 --> 22:02.762
Clear the rack. I'll take the fast tracks.
Dispo the pityriasis in 3.

22:02.939 --> 22:04.138
- Please?
- What?

22:04.316 --> 22:07.485
I've been flying all night.
I come in on my day off and it's a mess.

22:07.654 --> 22:09.613
- You could ask.
- Flying was your choice...

22:09.782 --> 22:13.533
...and it's not my fault you answered
your phone. Lower GI bleed in 5.

22:13.872 --> 22:17.457
Dr. Lewis, CT shows a non-displaced
zygomatic arch fracture.

22:17.628 --> 22:20.833
- Is she worthy to be seen yet?
- Luka's here. Give it to him.

22:21.510 --> 22:23.467
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:23.638 --> 22:25.346
- You're back.
- Yeah. This morning.

22:25.515 --> 22:28.352
I was getting worried.
I thought I'd at least get a postcard.

22:28.520 --> 22:30.312
You need to get e-mail.

22:30.481 --> 22:32.855
Didn't take long to get
sucked into this insanity.

22:33.028 --> 22:34.985
No. But it's good to see you, though.

22:35.156 --> 22:37.030
- You too.
- How long you been on?

22:37.201 --> 22:40.701
I was supposed to be off an hour ago.
Joyce Westlake.

22:40.873 --> 22:44.492
Her husband beat her up this morning,
broke her cheekbone.

22:45.088 --> 22:46.997
Don't let me open them.

22:48.050 --> 22:49.711
Good strength.

22:50.220 --> 22:51.466
Check the lower branches.

22:52.307 --> 22:53.968
Show me your teeth.

22:54.727 --> 22:59.273
Nice and symmetrical. Okay,
blow out your cheeks with air. Fine.

22:59.443 --> 23:01.188
Cranial nerves two through 11 intact.

23:01.279 --> 23:02.443
But not 12.

23:03.115 --> 23:06.118
It's an isolated dysfunction
of the right hypoglossal nerve.

23:06.287 --> 23:08.494
- It's a recurrence.
- You don't know that.

23:08.666 --> 23:10.125
I couldn't say "Solu-Medrol.”

23:10.585 --> 23:13.790
I do that all the time, especially if
I haven't had my morning latte.

23:13.966 --> 23:16.090
Pedes MVA rolling up.
Air-bag burn.

23:16.261 --> 23:17.839
Okay. In a second.

23:18.473 --> 23:20.716
- If you're worried, get an MRI.
- Yeah.

23:21.268 --> 23:24.851
Mark, it could be a lot of things. You're
under an enormous amount of stress.

23:24.886 --> 23:25.686
I'll check it out.

23:25.700 --> 23:28.159
You could have inflammatory changes
from your tumor vaccine.

23:28.237 --> 23:29.650
- Air bag?
- First and second degree.

23:29.740 --> 23:32.197
- BP's 110/70.
- He was in the front seat?

23:32.286 --> 23:34.659
- We were in a rush.
- You don't put kids in the front seat!

23:34.748 --> 23:35.911
It was a parking lot!

23:36.083 --> 23:38.705
- We're good. Luka's here.
- Good. Well, I got this one...

23:38.879 --> 23:40.588
...and you can get out from under it.

23:40.756 --> 23:43.760
- Any medical problems?
- Hay fever in the summer.

23:43.845 --> 23:46.634
Okay. Let's start with a lateral C-spine.

23:54.904 --> 23:57.277
- What are you doing?
- I'm on a break.

23:57.867 --> 23:59.777
Hello. We're getting killed here.

24:00.620 --> 24:02.614
I still get a break.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.585
Where is she?

24:05.754 --> 24:07.628
- What?
- Did you bring her here?

24:07.799 --> 24:09.342
- Joyce?
- Yes, Joyce!

24:09.510 --> 24:10.791
No. Why?

24:10.971 --> 24:12.928
I know she stayed with you last night.

24:13.015 --> 24:14.593
I know you picked her up, so stop lying.

24:14.768 --> 24:16.477
I know you beat the crap out of her.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.518
She swung a bat at my head.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.186
- Here. Wanna feel?
- No, thanks.

24:20.360 --> 24:22.603
- Just tell me what room.
- You're kidding, right?

24:22.780 --> 24:25.736
It's none of your business.
I thought you figured that out.

24:25.910 --> 24:27.369
You wanna see her?
I'll take you.

24:27.538 --> 24:30.576
She's talking to police.
I'm sure they have questions for you too.

24:30.960 --> 24:34.001
- Abby, can you get me the slit lamp?
- Yeah, sure.

24:34.136 --> 24:35.983
I need to check for hyphema.

24:38.054 --> 24:40.344
- Who's that?
- The husband.

24:41.893 --> 24:44.350
- Any belly pain?
- Soft, non-tender.

24:44.523 --> 24:46.480
Needs a BP.
Titrate four of morphine.

24:46.651 --> 24:49.356
Probably corneal burn.
BP, 120/50.

24:49.530 --> 24:53.031
All right, we need Alcaine,
fluorescein and a Wood's lamp.

24:53.203 --> 24:55.612
What exactly is Alcaine?
And where do you keep it?

24:55.790 --> 24:57.201
Mark?

24:57.710 --> 25:00.546
Can you get gentamicin ophthalmic
from the pharmacy?

25:00.714 --> 25:01.960
Did you get my page?

25:02.591 --> 25:04.087
I got a page from Neurology.

25:04.721 --> 25:07.556
Yeah. I was in Neurology
looking at your daughter's EEG.

25:08.392 --> 25:10.053
- You got this?
- Yeah.

25:10.229 --> 25:12.021
Coat the facial burns with Neosporin.

25:12.190 --> 25:13.768
Any spikes or sharp waves?

25:13.943 --> 25:16.352
No. Normal K complexes
and spindles throughout.

25:16.530 --> 25:19.819
- Good. Good. That's a good sign.
- Yeah, for now.

25:20.078 --> 25:23.578
You missed the consult. I thought you
were only gonna be here half an hour.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.494
They got swamped down here.

25:25.669 --> 25:27.663
- Swamped?
- Yeah.

25:29.425 --> 25:31.798
- What?
- Your daughter's in the PICU, Mark.

25:32.096 --> 25:35.763
- Breathing and showing signs of recovery.
- You run away and leave it all to me!

25:35.935 --> 25:39.310
I'm gonna go home, I'm gonna shower,
I'm gonna change my clothes, okay?

25:39.483 --> 25:43.102
Be careful, because the evil daughter's
there, waiting for me.

25:43.656 --> 25:46.528
Just go upstairs and sit with your baby.

25:47.119 --> 25:49.196
You told her to leave.

25:51.209 --> 25:52.787
She asked me what she could do.

25:52.961 --> 25:55.038
- You're serious?
- I'm perfectly serious.

25:55.215 --> 25:58.004
- I can't do that.
- Can't do what?

25:58.178 --> 26:00.005
I can't turn her away, not now.

26:00.181 --> 26:02.555
What has to happen?
Does she have to kill her?

26:02.810 --> 26:04.685
- Elizabeth-
- No! No!

26:04.855 --> 26:07.347
This time, I'm doing something.
She's out!

26:08.611 --> 26:10.404
I'm not choosing
between my daughters.

26:10.572 --> 26:12.446
You don't have to!
I'm choosing for you!

26:12.617 --> 26:15.026
What am I telling her
by letting you ship her away?

26:15.204 --> 26:18.825
That she needs to grow up!
That she needs to take responsibility!

26:19.001 --> 26:22.503
That what she does has very real
consequences for people besides herself!

26:22.674 --> 26:25.926
She realizes that. Do you think
she would actually hurt Ella again?

26:26.096 --> 26:29.633
Either she's out of the house
or I'm not taking that baby home.

26:29.810 --> 26:31.519
Hold on. Calm down.
Take a breath-

26:31.688 --> 26:34.560
- She's my child, Mark!
- I know that! She's mine too!

26:34.734 --> 26:37.191
Then start acting like it!

26:41.495 --> 26:43.868
- Ma'am, we're trying to help.
- You called the cops?

26:44.041 --> 26:47.043
- He fractured your face.
- No, he didn't! He didn't even touch me!

26:47.213 --> 26:48.541
Where can we find him?

26:48.714 --> 26:50.543
- Did you check the university?
- Abby, no!

26:50.718 --> 26:52.343
That's a big area. He's not at home.

26:52.428 --> 26:54.304
He hangs out at a bar down the street.

26:54.473 --> 26:55.885
I don't want to press charges.

26:56.059 --> 26:58.468
It's called The Windbreaker,
on Fourth and Ashland.

26:58.646 --> 27:00.973
There's obvious signs of abuse.
It's not up to you.

27:01.150 --> 27:03.109
Tell them no!
Tell them not to do this!

27:03.278 --> 27:05.652
We'll check it out.
Call if he shows up here again.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.984
He was here?

27:08.161 --> 27:10.618
- Sit down and let the doctor finish.
- What did he say?

27:10.791 --> 27:13.912
We're gonna find you a shelter,
someplace where he can't hurt you.

27:14.087 --> 27:16.330
I don't want to go to a shelter!
I wanna go home!

27:16.507 --> 27:18.382
What if you have a kid with him?

27:18.552 --> 27:21.424
Is this what you want for your kids?
You want him to beat them?

27:21.599 --> 27:23.676
- He wouldn't do that!
- Oh, wake up, Joyce!

27:24.269 --> 27:28.400
This is it. This is your chance
to get away, right now.

27:28.568 --> 27:31.274
It doesn't matter how wonderful
he can be sometimes.

27:31.448 --> 27:34.818
If you go back now, you're telling him
it's okay to do this to you...

27:34.994 --> 27:36.275
...and it is not okay.

27:41.254 --> 27:43.294
It's not okay.

27:51.478 --> 27:53.306
Your car's here.

27:58.197 --> 28:02.695
I managed to get a flight to Logan,
but I'm on standby.

28:02.871 --> 28:04.746
Can you imagine?

28:05.709 --> 28:07.999
I'll call you from the Cape.

28:08.880 --> 28:12.631
I'm sorry. John, I really am.

28:13.512 --> 28:15.222
Kids, you know...

28:15.849 --> 28:17.760
...they get over stuff.

28:19.438 --> 28:20.602
I bet if you went back...

28:20.774 --> 28:23.942
...Mickey would forget today
as quick as he can down a milk shake.

28:24.488 --> 28:28.024
No, you were right.
I became too involved.

28:30.413 --> 28:32.740
I'm thinking maybe I wasn't right.

28:36.882 --> 28:38.128
You see that tree?

28:41.848 --> 28:45.978
You and your brother built
a fort on that big limb...

28:46.063 --> 28:49.100
- ... and you played Tarzan.
- Bobby played Tarzan.

28:49.693 --> 28:51.272
I played Cheetah.

28:53.157 --> 28:55.484
You fell down
and you sprained your wrist.

28:55.870 --> 28:58.540
And you never even thought about
telling me that he pushed you.

29:00.502 --> 29:01.747
You knew?

29:02.547 --> 29:04.172
You two had your secrets.

29:05.634 --> 29:10.014
You stuck together.
I saw no reason to pull you apart.

29:12.479 --> 29:15.814
I didn't spend much time...

29:15.985 --> 29:19.686
...thinking about how
your brother's death affected you.

29:22.327 --> 29:26.113
I didn't spend much time on anyone.

29:28.294 --> 29:29.493
Do you have time now?

29:32.009 --> 29:33.967
I won't betray another little boy.

29:35.473 --> 29:38.641
- Betray?
- You don't wanna give up hope.

29:39.145 --> 29:43.524
You can't. Hope is all
either of you have.

29:43.985 --> 29:47.024
Your brother believed me
when I told him he'd get better.

29:47.950 --> 29:51.286
It didn't matter where he was...

29:51.455 --> 29:54.494
...how he felt, what the doctor said.

29:54.669 --> 29:57.161
I told him he'd get better.

29:58.383 --> 30:01.505
He died believing me.

30:02.473 --> 30:03.848
No.

30:04.183 --> 30:05.679
He was pretending for you.

30:07.355 --> 30:11.486
That was another one of our secrets.
I was supposed to not let you be sad.

30:17.371 --> 30:19.613
I was supposed to make you forget...

30:23.380 --> 30:25.255
...to make you happy.

30:28.346 --> 30:31.219
He made me promise to make you happy.

30:36.568 --> 30:38.228
I'm sorry, Mom.

30:43.577 --> 30:45.287
I love you.

30:45.581 --> 30:49.283
Do you hear me? I love you.

30:55.471 --> 30:58.010
Well, if there's no money,
it should be fairly-

30:58.184 --> 31:00.094
Can you hold on one second?

31:02.983 --> 31:04.941
- Yeah?
- Campanelli's. I got your pizza.

31:05.112 --> 31:06.606
Come on up.

31:06.947 --> 31:10.365
If there's no money, it should be
fairly straightforward, right?

31:11.204 --> 31:13.613
Well, there's a counselor there,
isn't there?

31:14.083 --> 31:15.994
Well, talk to her tomorrow.

31:16.755 --> 31:18.463
I don't know,
I guess you just...

31:18.632 --> 31:21.587
...go and get what you need
when you know he's not there.

31:22.638 --> 31:25.131
You know,
you did the right thing, Joyce.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.641
Okay. Can you hold on one second?

31:30.025 --> 31:33.728
We- We like this place too.
Good fettuccine.

31:34.866 --> 31:37.822
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Where's the delivery guy?

31:38.079 --> 31:39.704
Oh, I got it. It's on me.

31:39.874 --> 31:42.448
- No, that's okay.
- Where do you want it? Over here?

31:43.629 --> 31:45.338
Yeah, that's fine.

31:47.510 --> 31:49.837
We're still planning on
inviting you for dinner.

31:50.014 --> 31:52.767
- Brian...
- Listen, I screwed up.

31:55.523 --> 31:59.653
I have a problem, I need to get
some help for it. But I love my wife.

31:59.946 --> 32:02.985
I just have these strong feelings,
you know?

32:03.369 --> 32:06.869
And that's not an excuse,
and she might not talk to me.

32:07.500 --> 32:11.546
I understand I don't deserve forgiveness,
but I just wanna tell her I'm sorry.

32:11.715 --> 32:14.041
County Social Services
can get her a letter.

32:15.888 --> 32:17.882
So she's in a group home or something?

32:17.974 --> 32:19.553
I can't talk to you about this, Brian.

32:21.188 --> 32:24.807
- I just wanna make sure she's all right.
- She will be.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.567
Tell me where she is.
I promise I won't hurt her.

32:27.740 --> 32:28.937
I think you should leave.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.899
She's my life.

32:32.121 --> 32:34.695
Don't you get that?
She's everything to me.

32:34.875 --> 32:37.581
- You can't take her away from me.
- I didn't!

32:38.214 --> 32:40.421
- Abby, please. Where is she?
- No.

32:40.843 --> 32:42.587
- Where is she?
- All right, listen.

32:42.763 --> 32:45.172
You have to leave now,
or I'm gonna call the police.

32:45.350 --> 32:49.017
And I'm pretty sure you're not interested
in talking to them again, right?

32:53.237 --> 32:54.732
You're right.

32:55.115 --> 32:56.694
I'm sorry.

32:57.285 --> 32:58.693
Good night.

33:16.585 --> 33:18.590
911, what is your emergency?

33:22.263 --> 33:24.289
Brian. Brian!

34:52.335 --> 34:54.293
Oh, my God.

35:19.490 --> 35:21.815
Did she recommend a diet?

35:22.076 --> 35:24.650
- Did she talk to your parents?
- My mom.

35:24.912 --> 35:26.952
Tim is my stepdad.

35:27.123 --> 35:29.365
Well, I know it'll be hard at first.

35:29.542 --> 35:32.330
But if you start eating better,
you'll start feeling better.

35:32.504 --> 35:34.544
I know I'm fat. I don't care.

35:34.715 --> 35:38.297
I'm glad you're comfortable with
your body. That's very important.

35:38.469 --> 35:41.138
But you put on a lot of weight
in a short time...

35:41.222 --> 35:43.843
...and that can cause health problems.

35:44.100 --> 35:47.185
And, you know, you'll be
going to high school soon.

35:47.353 --> 35:50.105
- You'll be interested in boys.
- I don't like boys.

35:50.273 --> 35:53.689
Well, you say that now, but trust me,
in a couple of years, you'll want-

35:53.861 --> 35:56.778
No, I won't. I hate boys.

35:57.614 --> 36:00.366
Why? Why do you hate boys?

36:02.745 --> 36:04.702
Do you have problems with boys?

36:05.414 --> 36:06.873
With men?

36:07.167 --> 36:11.034
I don't want boys to touch me. Ever.

36:13.214 --> 36:16.548
Ariel, when did your mom
marry your stepfather?

36:16.718 --> 36:19.922
- Dr. Lewis, we need you.
- In a second.

36:20.263 --> 36:21.722
Was it within the last year?

36:22.725 --> 36:24.883
- Three months ago.
- Dr. Lewis, it's Abby.

36:25.061 --> 36:27.219
- She was assaulted.
- What?

36:27.396 --> 36:29.686
Pupils are 4 millimeters and reactive.

36:29.774 --> 36:31.054
How long were you passed out?

36:31.150 --> 36:32.942
- I don't know.
- What happened?

36:33.111 --> 36:36.694
My neighbor got pissed because I sent
his wife to a battered woman's shelter.

36:36.864 --> 36:41.077
Follow my finger with your eyes.
The guy that came here today?

36:42.329 --> 36:44.286
Chest is clear.

36:44.456 --> 36:45.737
He's your neighbor?

36:45.916 --> 36:50.163
Yeah. He wanted to know
where we placed Joyce.

36:50.338 --> 36:52.331
Good bowel sounds. Any belly pain?

36:52.423 --> 36:54.381
- Not really.
- And he knows where you live?

36:54.759 --> 36:56.218
Obviously.

36:58.930 --> 37:01.172
- Tender at the right costal margin.
- No, my nose.

37:01.349 --> 37:02.595
Oh. Sorry. Sorry.

37:02.768 --> 37:04.594
Can I get a gown?

37:05.813 --> 37:07.355
Right here.

37:12.445 --> 37:16.193
Okay. Head and facial CT.
CBC and dip a urine.

37:16.365 --> 37:18.939
- And titrate up to 10 of morphine.
- No, Tylenol.

37:19.160 --> 37:22.494
- Abby, you may have broken your nose.
- Yeah. I don't want any narcotics.

37:22.664 --> 37:24.455
- At least some Vicodin.
- Just Tylenol.

37:25.167 --> 37:28.453
Six-centimeter contusion,
medial aspect of the right thigh.

37:28.629 --> 37:29.910
Did you get kicked?

37:30.089 --> 37:31.713
I don't know.
Maybe when I fell.

37:31.883 --> 37:35.133
- Is there a chance you were raped?
- No.

37:36.220 --> 37:37.798
No, I don't think so.

37:37.972 --> 37:39.799
Set up a lighted speculum and rape kit.

37:39.974 --> 37:41.931
I was unconscious, I wasn't in a coma.

37:42.101 --> 37:44.059
We just need to be sure.

38:09.839 --> 38:11.168
Did she eat?

38:11.633 --> 38:13.508
Just passed out.

38:15.763 --> 38:17.174
Have you?

38:17.765 --> 38:19.508
- What?
- Eaten.

38:19.684 --> 38:21.012
No.

38:25.023 --> 38:27.181
Go. I'll take her.

38:34.491 --> 38:35.820
- We need to talk.
- No.

38:35.992 --> 38:39.694
I don't want to discuss it anymore.
Not tonight.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.725
Okay. Just one more swab.

39:00.060 --> 39:02.729
And then a vaginal aspirate...

39:02.980 --> 39:04.605
...then we're done.

39:05.525 --> 39:07.897
Have you had intercourse
in the last 72 hours?

39:08.903 --> 39:10.362
No.

39:10.780 --> 39:13.153
No signs of abrasion.

39:13.366 --> 39:16.071
No signs of trauma.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.453
No semen.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.742
I didn't think so.

39:23.419 --> 39:25.127
You can put your feet down.

39:25.295 --> 39:29.424
- So this guy lives on the same floor?
- Yeah.

39:29.592 --> 39:31.466
I'd think about moving.

39:31.636 --> 39:34.506
No, I'm not moving.
He's moving.

39:36.474 --> 39:38.847
Well, you definitely
have a nasal fracture.

39:39.019 --> 39:41.723
But it's non-displaced,
so when the swelling goes down...

39:41.897 --> 39:43.177
...you'll look good as new.

39:43.983 --> 39:47.601
CBC's normal, no blood in the urine.

39:48.738 --> 39:50.861
Could've been a lot worse.

39:51.282 --> 39:52.860
Yeah.

39:53.660 --> 39:56.198
You should be careful about
getting into these things.

39:56.621 --> 39:59.575
You know, I was trying to help the girl.

40:01.335 --> 40:06.044
I did help the girl. I mean, somebody
needed to do something. Something.

40:07.966 --> 40:09.295
Is there someone I can call?

40:09.719 --> 40:12.210
- Your mom?
- No.

40:12.388 --> 40:15.508
We don't need to admit you. Is
there somewhere you can stay tonight?

40:15.683 --> 40:17.475
Yeah, I'll be fine.

40:20.314 --> 40:23.065
You can't go home until they find him.
You can stay with me.

40:24.192 --> 40:25.817
I'm- I'll-

40:25.986 --> 40:29.153
I'm just gonna get a hotel or something.
Really, I'll be fine.

40:29.615 --> 40:31.025
And do you have your wallet?

40:32.827 --> 40:35.152
- I'll figure something out.
- Abby, stop it.

40:35.330 --> 40:39.493
It's a pullout, but it's comfortable.
It's free and it's safe.

40:42.921 --> 40:44.201
Thank you.

40:48.510 --> 40:50.171
The radiologist cleared the head CT.

40:50.346 --> 40:52.754
- And the facial cuts?
- Just the nose.

40:52.932 --> 40:54.176
- Was she...?
- No, no.

40:54.350 --> 40:57.850
No evidence of anything but getting
pummeled in the face. Did they find him?

40:58.021 --> 40:59.978
I don't know. Triage is cleared.

41:00.148 --> 41:02.983
Can you prep the pass-ons?
I still haven't unpacked.

41:03.151 --> 41:06.236
I've lived here five months,
I haven't unpacked.

41:06.404 --> 41:08.527
Yeah, bail.

41:11.618 --> 41:13.160
We did catch up.

41:13.246 --> 41:14.989
Yeah, now that you got a professional.

41:15.164 --> 41:17.536
- Jerry?
- Dr. Lewis.

41:17.708 --> 41:21.208
- They let this place go, huh?
- Yeah. What are you doing?

41:21.546 --> 41:23.206
- Working.
- Since when?

41:23.381 --> 41:25.753
I've been temping since
I've come out of retirement.

41:25.925 --> 41:27.301
- Where did you get that?
- What?

41:27.468 --> 41:28.714
The bagel.

41:28.887 --> 41:33.181
Under the desk. Somebody threw away
perfectly good dip too. You want some?

41:33.350 --> 41:35.557
You should go home, now.

41:50.744 --> 41:53.579
- I don't have a problem with you.
- I have a problem with you.

41:53.747 --> 41:56.417
- I got angry. It was a mistake.
- You hit women by mistake?

41:56.583 --> 41:58.291
I screwed up.

41:59.045 --> 42:00.622
Let's see you hit me, huh?

42:00.921 --> 42:02.945
I didn't mean to.
I lost my temper.

42:03.057 --> 42:05.084
Lose your temper with me.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.918
I'm gonna go to the cops now
and turn myself in.

42:12.434 --> 42:14.592
- Wait. Just wait!
- Better start swinging back!

42:16.605 --> 42:18.099
Hold on! Wait!

42:18.273 --> 42:20.432
I was wrong. I got angry.

42:20.943 --> 42:22.271
She took away my wife!

42:23.570 --> 42:24.946
You took away your wife!

42:28.701 --> 42:31.905
I know, I know, I know.
But I loved her.

42:32.080 --> 42:34.203
She's everything to me, and I lost her.

42:34.373 --> 42:35.655
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

42:36.626 --> 42:39.461
I won't mess with Abby again.
I won't even talk to her.

42:39.880 --> 42:41.919
I'll move. I'll move out
of the building.

42:42.091 --> 42:44.130
Please, I'm sorry. Please.

42:48.348 --> 42:50.305
You touch her again...

42:50.558 --> 42:52.215
...I'll kill you.

44:27.055 --> 44:30.139
