00:57.015 --> 00:58.933
Hi, José. What's up, asshole?

01:05.106 --> 01:09.819
-How are you doing that so fast?
-These new LCD screens are pretty easy.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.363
A couple screws and an attachment,
and you're there.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.616
Mo, where are those iPhone cases?

01:14.699 --> 01:17.535
Hurry up, asshole.
This gringa's waiting for us.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.121
-More specific. Which cases?
-iPhone 13.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.791
Next to the Samsung cases.
The ones with Selena.

01:22.874 --> 01:23.917
Rest in peace.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.630
-José will ring you up. Have a great day.
-You too.

01:28.713 --> 01:31.299
-Mo, I need to speak to you.
-What?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.718
You're speaking Arabic?

01:33.802 --> 01:36.471
Speaking Arabic
in front of customers is not a good sign.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.808
ICE raided our other store.
Put it right in our ass.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.769
Another infraction and we're shut down.
I'm so sorry, Mo.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.772
-You firing me?
-You don't have a work permit. Sorry.

01:45.855 --> 01:48.608
-What about José? He can't be legal.
-No, José is legal.

01:48.691 --> 01:50.652
Yeah, fuck you, I'm legal. I married in.

01:50.735 --> 01:51.945
You should marry Maria.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.114
She's fine as hell, and she's a mechanic.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.157
So… she got them… oily hands.

01:56.241 --> 02:00.370
Don't talk about her hands
or anything about her. He's disgusting.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.163
-Imagine his search history.
-Please.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.959
-He just did this.
-Look, no jerking off in public. Stop.

02:06.042 --> 02:08.169
How will you run things?
It's my place. I run--

02:08.253 --> 02:10.338
I mean, it's your place, but I run it.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.507
My asylum case is coming up soon.
Don't worry.

02:12.590 --> 02:16.386
-How long have you been waiting? 20 years?
-Twenty-two, actually. 22 years.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.638
<i>Inshallah</i>, it works out,
and you come back.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.348
I wouldn't if I had a work permit.

02:20.431 --> 02:24.102
Listen, come on. I'm so sorry.
I wish I could have done more.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.813
My blessings to your family.

02:26.896 --> 02:29.190
Not the first time
ICE has run me out of a job.

02:29.274 --> 02:32.235
-Damn, they gonna do you like that?
-Yeah, man.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.611
I'm gonna miss you.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.822
I wish I could say the same, <i>puto</i>.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.574
<i>-Cabrón</i>. All right.
-Asshole.

02:42.871 --> 02:46.291
I'm telling you,
if I see Ramón's ass crack one more time.

02:46.374 --> 02:48.001
Don't wanna hear about asses.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.795
I don't wanna see them.
I've tried everything. Nothing works.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.964
This guy's crack is relentless.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.383
Get him on oil changes.
Hide him under the car.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.635
Hm, not a bad idea.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.388
You gonna retire that?
Hang it up like a jersey?

03:00.471 --> 03:03.391
I'm gonna keep it.
I don't want my mom to know I got fired.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.059
-You haven't told her?
-No.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.354
I'll figure out my next move,
and then I'll tell her.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.816
What? Why're you looking at me like that?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.151
Why that face?

03:13.234 --> 03:14.611
You don't know my mom.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.488
-Because you never let me see her.
-You saw her a week ago.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.574
I said hello and goodbye, like always.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.742
Two years.

03:20.825 --> 03:22.869
Two years dating,
and we've never had dinner.

03:22.952 --> 03:26.122
-You want her to grill you again?
-I can't take her religious shit?

03:26.706 --> 03:30.585
"Maria, why do you Catholics
worship the three gods?"

03:30.668 --> 03:32.337
My mom turned into the Godfather?

03:32.420 --> 03:35.965
"You broke my heart, Sonny.
You broke my heart." What are you doing?

03:36.049 --> 03:38.384
-Who is this person?

03:38.468 --> 03:40.178
What is the Trinity? Explain.

03:40.261 --> 03:44.933
-The Father, Son, Holy Ghost.
-What is it? No, don't do that. Good lord.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.685
-Kiss it, kiss.
-No, it neutralize it.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.606
What's it about? Want me to wear a hijab?
Is that what this is about?

03:51.689 --> 03:54.984
I mean, a hijab is optional.
What about cutting out pork first?

03:55.068 --> 03:57.987
-No <i>pastor</i>?
-Or work on your titty cleavage?

03:58.071 --> 04:00.823
You were just complaining
about butt cleavage.

04:00.907 --> 04:05.453
Titty cleavage. Okay! Why don't you start
with the basic Muslim package first?

04:05.536 --> 04:07.622
Are you calling me basic? Huh?

04:07.705 --> 04:10.416
Any of this basic? This basic to you?

04:11.125 --> 04:12.210
-No.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.711
-Hm?
-Mm-mm.

04:15.129 --> 04:18.424
-Besides, you don't even go to mosque.
-All right, get off me.

04:19.425 --> 04:22.637
Can't mention mosque, okay?
It's the anti-Viagra.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.473
We were getting freaky.
Now I'm thinking about my family.

04:25.556 --> 04:26.599
It's fucked up.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.810
You should go to church with me someday.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.020
You could use a good confession.

04:33.564 --> 04:36.776
You know, nuns wear hijab,
and they're not basic.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.322
It's the OG hijab.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.964
Everything here
is made from plastic.

04:58.047 --> 05:02.343
I want authentic wooden baking molds.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.138
Everything here is made in China.

05:05.972 --> 05:06.848
<i>Habibi!</i>

05:06.931 --> 05:09.434
Watch what's in front of you.
You'll drop my lamps.

05:09.517 --> 05:12.270
You have 100 lamps
and none are plugged in.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.855
Those are antiques.

05:13.938 --> 05:17.442
Antiques? It has a Target sticker
for $11.99. Don't exaggerate.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.610
So people know the bargain I got.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.113
Come, Hamoodi wants to say hello.

05:22.196 --> 05:25.199
-<i>Come here, habibi.</i>
-Come. May God keep him happy.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.827
-He just got back from work. Say hi.
-Hello.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.330
Peace and blessings. Hello.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.124
<i>Hi, habibi.</i>
<i>Looks like you're gaining weight.</i>

05:33.207 --> 05:35.209
Okay. All praise due. Everything's well.

05:35.293 --> 05:40.340
For the love of God, move the camera back.
All I see is your nose. Much better.

05:40.423 --> 05:45.345
<i>You need to take care if you want to find</i>
<i>a good woman that's loveable and sweet.</i>

05:45.428 --> 05:46.554
Mom, let me leave.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.891
He's not dating anyone
named Aysha or Khadija

05:49.974 --> 05:52.310
because he is with a Mexican girl.

05:52.393 --> 05:54.354
Not only that, she's Christian too.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.815
<i>What are you saying?</i>
<i>Is it true, Hamoodi?</i>

05:57.899 --> 05:58.941
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

05:59.025 --> 06:01.986
-She might convert. You never know.
-God willing.

06:02.070 --> 06:08.076
<i>Hadi wants the Samsung Galaxy.</i>
<i>Can you get me one from work? We'll pay.</i>

06:08.159 --> 06:12.538
I can't take money from my cousin.
What are you talking about?

06:12.622 --> 06:15.124
I promise on my eyes and head.
No money or anything.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.252
<i>-You sure?</i>
-Of course I am.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.713
I have to go, Mama, please.

06:20.797 --> 06:24.384
-God give you wellness.
-And may God give you wellness.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.178
Did you see what I am dealing with?

06:27.845 --> 06:32.392
As I told you,
the wooden molds and a tin of olive oil.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.897
I want the wooden molds
and also a tin of olive oil.

07:10.346 --> 07:13.558
-Why are you looking at me like that?
-Working on my eye contact.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.809
Yeah.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.811
-Hey, Hamoodi?
-Yeah, <i>habibi</i>?

07:16.894 --> 07:21.107
I need you to get Meow Munch Original.
It's the only brand Crystal eats now.

07:21.190 --> 07:23.401
What do we do
with the Perfect Portions we got?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.319
I also need you to return that.

07:30.032 --> 07:33.077
I don't have time for this.
I'll get it for you when I can.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.620
If you don't get it in time…

07:35.580 --> 07:38.499
-I'll tell Mom about your tattoo.
-Please don't, okay?

07:38.583 --> 07:41.043
Mom, Hamoodi distorted
his body with a tattoo.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.422
-Everything is great.
-Sameer, keep it down! I'm watching TV.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.340
He's joking with you.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.050
I'll get your stupid cat food.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.302
My cat's not stupid.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.804
No, not the cat, I love Crystal.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.222
Crystal loves you, too. Okay.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.932
Peace be upon you.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.058
Peace be upon you.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.560
Go ahead.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.562
-May God keep you safe.
-You too.

08:21.667 --> 08:25.004
-You Zionists drive me crazy.
-You can huff and puff until you're blue,

08:25.087 --> 08:28.549
but in 1947, the UN presented a plan
offering both sides their own country.

08:28.633 --> 08:32.553
It began, devised by European colonists
who seized the land in the first place.

08:32.637 --> 08:35.515
Rabin, Arafat,
you done recording your podcast?

08:36.098 --> 08:37.391
Let's table the peace talks.

08:37.475 --> 08:41.187
-Peace? Don't you talk about peace.
-Calm down.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.648
Enough drama, okay?
I already got fired.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.108
-Lost your job? What did you do?
-Yeah.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.278
I didn't do anything, why me?
Rahman's other store got raided by ICE.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.864
-He got scared and let me go.
-No balls, that guy.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.492
Here, guys. Okay, we got the hummus,

08:54.575 --> 08:56.118
we got a side of chickpeas.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.830
Lemon juice. Very sexy, huh?

08:59.914 --> 09:02.124
Learn English, kid. Hummus ain't sexy.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.418
<i>Shee foo</i>, man. <i>Shee foo</i>.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.672
Look at him.
How he does his hummus. So particular.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.674
A true native.
The love of my heart.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.260
I'm real. It's in my blood.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.929
They have a new snack-cup
hummus now. It's not bad.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.848
It's a damn war crime.
I'm triggered by this.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.352
-It hurts. Like a cyst on my scrotum.
-What will you do for work?

09:21.435 --> 09:23.563
Back to selling bootlegs and counterfeits.

09:23.646 --> 09:26.065
-What else?
-Why do you need to sell that crap?

09:26.148 --> 09:28.317
I'm good at it. Will you hook me up?

09:28.401 --> 09:31.487
Selling is the only thing
I can do without papers.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.824
Aba has a suit shop,
why don't you go and work for him?

09:34.907 --> 09:36.409
-I'd love to.
-Of course.

09:36.492 --> 09:38.828
Kid's a natural salesman.
But what am I, a charity?

09:38.911 --> 09:41.414
He wants to sell merch. Introduce him.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.667
It's just a side hustle.
I'll look for other jobs.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.044
Listen, Mo, your father…

09:47.128 --> 09:49.046
-God have mercy on him.
-Amen.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.215
He wouldn't want you
getting in trouble.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.593
I'm not gonna get in trouble. Okay?

09:53.676 --> 09:56.887
I need to support my family.
I don't wanna sell this shit.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.223
Should I start whoring out on the streets?

09:59.307 --> 10:02.893
I have to beg? After whoring,
knocking door-to-door. You want that?

10:02.977 --> 10:05.479
-I'll help you. I'll call.
-You'll call?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.815
Thank you. .

10:07.898 --> 10:09.692
Happy now?

10:09.775 --> 10:13.738
I'm happy. I'd be really
happy if we'd go back to 1967 borders.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.615
Ten million Palestinians exiled.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.533
-What about our right to return?
-1967?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.452
That was a war. You lost it.

10:19.535 --> 10:23.372
-What did you say now?
-We'll never reach a deal with that…

10:51.317 --> 10:54.612
Hey, how you doing, bro?
Hey, I'm not your dad, bro.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.989
Don't have to be mad at me.
How you doing, ma'am?

10:57.073 --> 10:58.074
I like your outfit.

10:58.157 --> 11:01.202
I have something that'd go with that.
That goes very well with that.

11:01.285 --> 11:05.039
You don't need…
You don't need me. Have a nice day.

11:19.303 --> 11:21.931
-How're you doing? Beautiful weather.
-Yeah, it is.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.975
-We're lucky. You got orthopedics?
-Yes, sir.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.978
Slow down. Don't hurt yourself.
What are they, nine and a half?

11:28.062 --> 11:31.190
Son of a bitch, right again.
They're my old trusties.

11:31.273 --> 11:34.985
-They're doing a number on your back, huh?
-God, my lower back is killing me.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.863
Same here.
Until I switched over to Yeezys.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.242
My back pain disappeared.
Thank you, Yeezus, I say.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.245
-Let me show you something.
-Oh no, I…

11:44.328 --> 11:46.455
Holy shit, you got a store in there.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.125
-I'm an entrepreneur. Look at this.
-Good for you.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.086
Thank you. Designer yet orthopedic.

11:52.169 --> 11:57.258
That doesn't look like anything
I'd wear. They look like alien's shoes.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.844
They're from whatever planet Kanye's from,

11:59.927 --> 12:02.346
but don't judge until you try them on.
Come on.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.307
Come on in for a moon landing.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.810
Ain't gonna take 30 seconds of your time.

12:07.893 --> 12:11.689
-Here we go. Gotta look after your back.
-Yeah, that I do.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.733
Here you go. Give them a try.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.360
-All right.
-They're genuine recycled algae.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.945
-Whoa!
-Yeah.

12:18.028 --> 12:18.988
Whoa!

12:19.947 --> 12:21.574
Oh, my goodness, look at…

12:22.324 --> 12:24.285
Son, these shoes are golden. How much?

12:24.368 --> 12:27.663
Aftermarket, these go for about $350,000.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.123
-Let me get--
-Whoa.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.500
I'm willing to sell them for $200.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.588
Son, I can't tell my wife
I paid $200 for a pair of algae shoes.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.965
I smell what you're stepping in, okay?

12:38.048 --> 12:39.467
So I'll sweeten the pot.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.761
Now, for $300…

12:41.844 --> 12:45.014
I know. Hold…
Hold on a second, hear me out.

12:45.097 --> 12:50.060
I'll throw in this Chanel purse.
Now, this will retail well over $1000.

12:50.144 --> 12:53.063
You ain't gonna find
a better replica than this.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.774
She won't know the difference.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.627
-This is not real?
-No.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.463
Don't be selling bags
that are fake as hell.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.549
These are high-quality replicas.
Have some respect for my shit.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.677
That's the problem.
They look a little too real.

13:23.761 --> 13:27.681
Remember Fat Phillip? Just got jammed up
for selling fake Louis Vs.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.475
They hit him with a felony.

13:29.558 --> 13:33.604
Nothing criminal about what I do.
Kanye thinks I'm stealing from him?

13:33.687 --> 13:37.817
-He's busy designing moccasins for NASA.
-I don't care about him. I care about you.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.151
You can get into trouble.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.654
That's not entirely true.
She voted for Kanye.

13:42.154 --> 13:44.657
-You voted for Kanye?
-He's a freethinker.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.368
The only one
that wasn't bought out by Wall Street.

13:47.451 --> 13:48.869
-Self-made man.
-Wow.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.582
You're a wild nigga.
You know how Mo and I became brothers?

13:54.166 --> 13:57.169
His dad died around the same time
my pops went to jail.

13:57.253 --> 14:01.298
-And we got tattoos of our dads' names.
-I didn't know you had one like Mo.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.716
Guess he forgot to tell you.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.262
He also forgot that he used to drive me
to visit my pops when he was in jail.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.932
He definitely forgot
what the inside of a jail looks like.

14:10.015 --> 14:13.769
-Bro, chill. Nobody's going to jail.
-They'll send you back to Palestine first.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.771
I never been to Palestine.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.315
I don't have citizenship there,
I don't have it here.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.819
I'm like a refugee free agent.
I don't even have a fucking passport.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.113
All I have is my asylum claim.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.032
-And Chanel bags.
-What are you saying?

14:27.116 --> 14:30.411
-You got us and your family.
-Exactly.

14:30.911 --> 14:33.038
That's why
I gotta take care of them today.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.042
I gotta do what I gotta do
until I have my own business,

14:37.126 --> 14:40.421
buy my own piece of land,
and do things the right way.

14:40.504 --> 14:43.424
-You'd do terrible in jail.
-What are you saying? I'd flourish.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.886
Form alliances,
join the Muslims, do Friday prayers.

14:46.969 --> 14:51.473
-You cried at my cousin's <i>quinceañera</i>.
-It was emotional. She became a woman.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.518
Bro, you're a big dude,
but you know you're just…

14:55.519 --> 14:56.353
cuddly.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.605
Super cuddly.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.940
-Facts. That's true.
-You are, though.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.109
But I would kill it in prison, though.

15:02.192 --> 15:03.861
For real. I'd sell loosies,

15:04.403 --> 15:07.823
I'd get some cigarettes from the outside,
start using the… yeah, uh-huh.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.578
-I'd start using the security guards…
-You just took food to the mouth.

15:12.661 --> 15:15.706
People who get fed by their girl,
they don't do good in prison.

15:15.789 --> 15:19.335
It's a different situation. She's my girl.
I'm trying to give you my strategy.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.962
-Look at this.
-Chill. I'm not doing that.

15:22.046 --> 15:25.215
-There's a plane coming. A plane.
-Stop playing, I don't like it.

15:25.299 --> 15:28.594
-There's a plane. Airplane. Look at you.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.373
Crystal's gonna be happy.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.088
Hello, sir.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.173
Would you like to try
some chocolate hummus?

16:06.840 --> 16:08.592
-The fuck you say to me?
-What?

16:09.468 --> 16:12.304
Did you say chocolate hummus?
You know what you just did?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.682
You insulted my grandmother. Yeah.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.226
"Fuck your lineage.
To hell with your culture."

16:17.309 --> 16:19.979
<i>Lo siento</i>,
I did not know hummus was Mexican.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.564
It's not Mexican. It's Palestinian.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.275
You know what?
There's a lot of misinformation out there.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.404
-It's not your fault.
-You always carry that around?

16:28.487 --> 16:31.615
Yeah, some people carry hot sauce,
I carry olive oil.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.284
Not just any, it's Palestinian.
Next level.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.745
Oh, it's gonna be so good. I can't wait.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.539
The pita's for the hummus.

16:38.622 --> 16:42.167
That's not hummus.
That's a damn shit emoji.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.462
Would you put chocolate on guacamole?
No, I don't think so.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.297
Trust me. All right.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.009
-Mm! Uh-huh!
-It's not bad.

16:50.718 --> 16:51.593
It's really good.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.097
-Look out!
-He's got a gun!

16:55.180 --> 16:58.100
-Get down!
-Someone call 911!

17:02.980 --> 17:05.858
<i>I need you to get some</i>
<i>Meow Munch Original for Crystal.</i>

17:05.941 --> 17:08.235
<i> Would you like</i>
<i>some chocolate hummus?</i>

17:08.318 --> 17:10.654
<i>Damn, he got shot in some Yeezys?</i>

17:10.738 --> 17:13.115
<i>Not the 500s Triple-black?</i>

17:14.074 --> 17:16.326
-What's going on?
-You fainted, sir.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.079
What? Why does my arm hurt?

17:19.163 --> 17:21.248
That's the bullet wound.
You were shot.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.042
What? I got shot?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.919
I got shot and you led with,
"You fainted"?

17:26.003 --> 17:29.339
It's just a graze. You'll be fine
once they treat it at the hospital.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.593
-No hospitals.
-No, sir, you were in a mass shooting.

17:32.676 --> 17:36.305
-You're in shock. You need a hospital--
-I said no hospitals.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.806
It's not a mass shooting.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.768
Only three people got shot,
it takes four to be mass.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.063
Yeah, but the shooter also got shot,
that's four people.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.774
-So it's a mass.
-No, the shooter doesn't count.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.818
Hey, assholes,
I'm refusing medical attention.

17:50.486 --> 17:55.741
I'm uninsured. I'm not paying $5000
for an ambulance ride. No fucking way.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.578
Well, Bilal, that brings us down
to three victims.

18:00.245 --> 18:02.456
I guess it's definitely not a mass now.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.878
Goddamn you, Crystal,
and your fucking Meow Munch!

18:07.961 --> 18:11.381
You're really lucky, man.
This just missed your brachial artery.

18:11.465 --> 18:13.717
-I got shot!
-Bro, you got grazed.

18:13.801 --> 18:17.846
-A bullet went through my arm. I got shot.
-Here, man, hit that.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.224
I don't mess with lean.

18:20.307 --> 18:23.727
Took too many Houston legends,
Pimp C, Big Moe, DJ Screw.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.022
Does it look like we trying to get lit?
For the pain.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.441
You have something I can bite down on?

18:30.984 --> 18:32.444
All right, fuck it.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.281
Hey, slow down. Slow down. Baby steps, Mo.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.699
Damn.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.415
Hey, I'll send you home
with a few bottles.

18:45.916 --> 18:49.336
Should be enough to get you through.
Just mix it with soda and candy,

18:49.419 --> 18:50.587
you're gonna be straight.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.964
Just don't go crazy with it.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.258
-Thank you, bro.
-I got you.

18:54.341 --> 18:57.845
-How much do I owe you?
-No, you good. This one's on the house.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.429
Crazy-ass White people.

19:20.742 --> 19:24.496
I've been trying to call you
all evening, and you didn't answer.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.165
What's happened?

19:26.248 --> 19:28.333
-Go to sleep, Mama.
-What happened?

19:28.417 --> 19:32.504
-Go back to sleep!
-What's going on? What are you hiding?

19:32.588 --> 19:33.589
-Nothing.

19:34.798 --> 19:35.757
What is this?

19:35.841 --> 19:38.385
-Nothing happened.
-Talk. What happened?

19:38.468 --> 19:42.723
I got attacked by a stray
dog. That's all. Pit bulls are everywhere.

19:42.806 --> 19:44.266
No. Mohammed.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.561
Say the truth. What happened?

19:50.772 --> 19:51.940
I got shot, okay?

19:52.608 --> 19:54.484
-Shot?
Yes.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.653
Sit.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.115
Who shot you?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.284
Did a gang bang you?

20:02.367 --> 20:04.786
I didn't get gang banged, Ma.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.206
I was grocery shopping
for Sameer's cat food,

20:07.289 --> 20:09.833
some crazy White guy came in,
started shooting.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.376
Be careful.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.004
Don't worry. Don't worry.

20:16.131 --> 20:19.468
Don't worry, Mo.
<i>Hamdulilah</i>, it's only a graze.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.347
Just clean it and take off
this shirt when you go…

20:27.100 --> 20:30.062
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What is that?

20:30.145 --> 20:32.648
-Just calm down.
-Hamoodi, what is that?

20:32.731 --> 20:35.943
-A tattoo, Mohamad?
-I got shot, and you focus on the tattoo?

20:36.026 --> 20:38.946
-What's wrong with you?
-A graze will heal.

20:39.029 --> 20:43.533
But a tattoo,
is a disgrace on your life forever.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.994
-Of course!
-You even know what's on it? What is it?

20:46.078 --> 20:47.287
Look at it.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.129
I got it four years
after he passed away.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.133
Baby, sweetheart.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.052
Before you were born,

21:03.011 --> 21:04.972
we barely got out of Palestine,

21:05.055 --> 21:08.225
then <i>alhamdulillah</i>, we escaped Kuwait.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.978
And now we are safe here in America.

21:11.061 --> 21:15.482
And, sweetheart,
you come shot while shopping for cat food.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.652
-What is this? Sweetheart…
-Oh, Hamoodi…

21:19.403 --> 21:20.696
You won't believe this,

21:21.196 --> 21:24.574
but Crystal started eating
Perfect Portions, so…

21:24.658 --> 21:26.201
never mind the Meow Munch.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.790
Oh, shit.
