WEBVTT

00:19.394 --> 00:20.611
Lights.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.552
Lights.

00:48.882 --> 00:52.011
You know the drill, people.
Acid visors down and locked.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.266
Buzzer.

01:05.232 --> 01:09.829
- Reading of 9.7.
- Sounds a bit low for Unrefined.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.455
- How's the average?
- The acid potency stats

01:12.531 --> 01:15.626
have definitely dropped below the mean
during the last quarter.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.454
- Prettier than a computer, isn't she?
- Give over, Buzz.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.584
Whoa!

01:20.706 --> 01:23.585
Buzzer! Buzz!

01:26.712 --> 01:31.764
Oh, great. Nice going, twinkle-toes.

01:31.842 --> 01:34.595
I shouldn't have swung at him.
Sorry, Buzz. My bad.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.851
No, you're all right. Jimmy?

01:37.639 --> 01:39.812
Well, no point
carrying you back legless.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.564
Sorry, Buzzer, you're dead.

01:41.643 --> 01:45.273
Oh, this is a right pain in the armour.
Heart's gone now.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.947
Look, we'd best get off.
Got to write this one up for the boss.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.996
- Those suits cost a bomb.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.324
If I miss my boy's birthday
filling out forms, I'll kill you again.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.787
Lights.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.497
I'm looking at these readings,
Jimmy.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.503
And the potency stats are way too low.

02:03.540 --> 02:07.295
We may have to take that read again.
This thing is still jamming up on me.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.597
So, uh, I think we'd better talk about
what just happened back there.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.806
I could get compensation.
I've seen the holo-ads.

02:15.886 --> 02:18.605
"Had an accident in the workplace?"
Yeah, I have, as it goes.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.478
- I've melted.
- Let it go.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.606
Look, just remember, when you're doing
your report, it wasn't my fault.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.686
She took a swing at me.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.239
I never touched you.
You've got two left feet, Buzzer.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.987
I haven't got two left feet.

02:29.066 --> 02:33.572
Or any arms, neck, head, the chin.
This body costs money, love.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.497
Not as much as that acid suit.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.125
Oh, lighten up.
It's not like anyone was hurt.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.592
Forty-six.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.847
Rubbishy, rubbishy rubbish.

03:37.926 --> 03:41.681
- Hello! It's a double-top.
- Wrong side of the wire, mister.

03:42.055 --> 03:46.401
- You're on the oche, Red.
- I'm not. Stop trying to put me off.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.745
Who wants fish and chips?

03:56.820 --> 03:59.573
I'll drop you both off.
Take your time. Don't rush.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.034
- Er...and you?
- Uh, things to do.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.744
Things involving other things.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.250
Well, we'll stay with you.
We'll do the other things.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.793
Nope.

04:07.873 --> 04:11.719
Whatever you're up to,
I'd personally like to be a part of it.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.130
What?

04:20.469 --> 04:22.096
- Whoa!

04:23.680 --> 04:25.933
Solar tsunami.
Came directly from your sun.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.769
A tidal wave of radiation.
Big, big, big!

04:34.065 --> 04:37.865
- Uh, Doctor, my tummy's going funny.
- Well, the gyrator disconnected.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.867
Target tracking is out.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.839
Assume the position!

05:07.516 --> 05:08.893
Textbook landing.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.774
Behold! A cockerel!

05:12.562 --> 05:14.155
Love a cockerel.

05:15.941 --> 05:19.991
And underneath, a monastery,
uh, 13th century.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.243
Oh, we've gone all medieval.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.701
- I'm not sure about that.
- Really? Medieval expert, are you?

05:25.742 --> 05:28.461
No, it's just that
I can hear Dusty Springfield.

05:28.537 --> 05:34.510
# You don't have to say you love me
just be close at hand

05:34.918 --> 05:36.295
# You don't have to... #

05:36.378 --> 05:37.846
These fissures are new.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.515
Solar tsunami sent out
a huge wave of gamma particles.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.185
This is caused by a magnetic quake
that occurs just before the wave hits.

05:44.261 --> 05:48.061
- Well, the monastery's standing.
- Yeah, for now.

05:48.139 --> 05:52.064
- Doctor, look.
- Yeah. It's a supply pipe.

05:53.436 --> 05:57.532
Ceramic inner lining.
Something corrosive.

05:59.025 --> 06:02.404
They're pumping something nasty
off this island to the mainland.

06:02.487 --> 06:05.741
My mum's a massive fan
of Dusty Springfield.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.705
Who isn't?

06:07.784 --> 06:11.630
Right, let's go!
Satisfy our rabid curiosity.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.837
# ...loneliness

06:15.250 --> 06:19.801
# There is nothing left to fee!

06:19.880 --> 06:21.757
# You don? Have to say.-. #

06:21.840 --> 06:24.468
So, where are these
Dusty Springfield-loving monks, then?

06:24.551 --> 06:26.599
I think we're here. This is it.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.806
Doctor, what are you talking about?
We've never been here before.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.688
- We came here by accident.
- Hmm? Accident?

06:31.933 --> 06:34.106
- Yes, I know. Accident.
- Ah! Ow!

06:34.185 --> 06:36.028
Acid. They're pumping acid
off this island.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.315
That's old stuff.
Fresh acid, you wouldn't have a finger.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.442
Hmm.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.369
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

06:43.445 --> 06:45.413
There are people coming. Well, almost.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.161
- Almost coming?
- Almost people.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.377
- I think we should really be going.
- Come on!

06:50.452 --> 06:52.329
I am telling you,
when something runs toward you,

06:52.412 --> 06:54.130
it's never for a nice reason.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.310
- What are all these harnesses for?
- Uh, the "almost people"?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.603
What are they, prisoners?
Or are they meditating, or what?

07:08.678 --> 07:11.773
Well, at the moment
they fall into the "or what" category.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.647
halt and remain calm.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.649
Well, we've halted.
How are we all doing on the calm front?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.947
Don't move!

07:22.901 --> 07:25.825
Stay back, Jen.
We don't know who they are.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.490
So let's ask them. Who the hell are you?

07:28.573 --> 07:30.166
Well, I'm The Doctor
and this is Amy and Row

07:30.241 --> 07:31.413
and it's all very nice, isn't it?

07:31.493 --> 07:34.542
Hold up. You're all...
What are you all, like identical twins?

07:35.830 --> 07:38.174
This is an Alpha-grade
industrial facility.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.546
Unless you work for the military

07:39.626 --> 07:42.800
or for Morpeth Jetsan,
you are in big trouble.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.058
Actually, you're in big trouble.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.886
Meteorological Department? Since when?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.769
- Since you were hit by a solar wave.
- Which we survived.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.566
Just, by the look of it.
And there's a bigger one on the way.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.644
Which we'll also survive.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.354
Dicken, scan for bugs.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.610
Backs against the wall. Now.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.488
You're not a monastery,
you're a factory.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.535
22nd century Army-owned factory.

08:06.611 --> 08:07.658
You're Army?

08:07.737 --> 08:10.866
No, love, we're contractors.
And you're trespassers.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.625
It's clear, boss.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.548
All right, weatherman,
your ID checks out.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.334
If there's another solar storm,
what are you going to do about it?

08:21.418 --> 08:22.544
Hand out sunblock?

08:23.753 --> 08:26.381
I need to see your critical systems.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.766
Which one?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.261
You know which one.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.043
And there you are.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.881
Meet the government's
worst kept secret. The Flesh.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.470
It's fully programmable matter.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.722
In fact, it's even learning
to replicate itself

09:11.801 --> 09:13.053
at the cellular level.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.185
Right. Brilliant. Lost.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.348
Okay.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.566
Once a reading's been taken,

09:19.642 --> 09:22.486
we can manipulate
its molecular structure into anything,

09:22.562 --> 09:26.783
replicate a living organism down
to the hairs on its chinny chin chin.

09:26.858 --> 09:29.452
Even clothes.
And everything's identical.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.030
- Eyes, voice...
- Mind, soul.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.740
Don't be fooled, Doctor,

09:33.782 --> 09:37.036
it acts like life but it still needs
to be controlled by us,

09:37.118 --> 09:38.836
from those harnesses you saw.

09:38.912 --> 09:44.464
Wait, whoa, hold it.
So, you're Flesh now?

09:44.501 --> 09:46.754
I'm lying in a harness
back in that chamber.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.089
We all are, except Jennifer here.

09:49.172 --> 09:52.927
Don't be scared. This thing,
just like operating a forklift truck.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.262
You said it could grow.
Only living things grow.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.180
Moss grows. It's no more than that.

09:57.889 --> 10:01.268
This acid is so dangerous,
we were losing a worker every week.

10:02.352 --> 10:06.198
So now we mine the acid
using these doppelgangers, or Gangers.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.320
If these bodies get burnt
or fall in the acid...

10:08.399 --> 10:10.322
Then who the hell cares? Right, Jen?

10:11.986 --> 10:17.368
Nerve endings automatically cut off,
like airbags being discharged.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.919
So we wake up and get a new Ganger.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.714
It's weird but you get used to it.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.589
Jennifer, I want you in your Ganger.
Get back to the harness.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.135
- Hang on.
- What's he up to?

10:31.214 --> 10:32.591
What are you up to, pal?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.602
Stop it. Ah...

10:36.594 --> 10:41.145
Strange, it was like for a moment there
it was scanning me.

10:43.518 --> 10:44.735
Doctor.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.569
- Get back, Doctor, leave it alone!

10:53.653 --> 10:55.621
I understand.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.245
Doctor?

10:58.324 --> 11:00.577
- Are you all right?
- Incredible.

11:01.202 --> 11:05.002
You have no idea. No idea.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.252
I mean, I felt it in my mind.
I reached out to it and it to me.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.086
Don't fiddle with the money, Doctor.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.172
How can you be so blinkered?
It's alive. So alive.

11:12.255 --> 11:15.509
You're piling your lives,
your personalities directly into it.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.689
It's the solar storm.

11:22.807 --> 11:27.062
The first waves come in pairs.
Pre-shock and fore-shock. It's close.

11:27.145 --> 11:28.943
Buzzer, we got anything
from the mainland yet?

11:28.980 --> 11:31.153
No, the comms are still
too jammed with radiation.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.907
Okay, then we'll keep pumping acid
until the mainland says stop.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.365
Now, why don't you stand back
and let us impress you?

11:41.367 --> 11:44.667
ID con firmed. Jennifer Lucas.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.293
The meter is running.

12:06.559 --> 12:10.029
CD 0 1 0

12:10.855 --> 12:15.361
Motor functions, online.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.283
Plumbing in.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.828
- Oh!

13:04.033 --> 13:06.411
Well, I can see
why you keep it in a church.

13:06.494 --> 13:10.294
- Miracle of life.
- No need to get poncy. It's just gunge.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.171
Guys, we need to get to work.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.469
Okay, everybody, let's crack on.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.923
Did I mention the solar storm?

13:18.006 --> 13:20.475
- You need to get out of here.
- Where do you want us to go?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.099
- We're on a tiny island.
- Well, I can get you all off it.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.306
Don't be ridiculous.
We've got a job to do.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.891
It's coming.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.068
That's the alarm.

13:30.101 --> 13:33.321
- How do you get power?
- We're solar. We use a solar router.

13:33.396 --> 13:34.898
- The weathervane.
- Big problem.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.485
Boss, maybe if the storm's back,
we should get underground.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.112
The factory's seen better days.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.322
The acid pipes might not withstand
another hit.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.123
We have 200 tons of acid to pump out.

13:44.198 --> 13:46.041
We fall behind,
we stay another rotation.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.336
- Anyone want that?
- Please.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.084
You're making a massive mistake here.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.086
You're right at the crossroads of it.
Don't turn the wrong way.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.214
If you don't, if you don't
prepare for this storm,

13:55.293 --> 13:57.011
you are all in terrible danger.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.679
Understand?

13:58.755 --> 14:01.975
My factory, my rules.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.939
I need to check
the progress of the storm.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.641
Monitoring station.

14:09.724 --> 14:12.193
- Mmm.
- Monitoring station.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.487
Three lefts, a right, and a left.
Third door on your left.

14:14.562 --> 14:15.563
Thank you.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.284
Waves disturbing
the Earth's magnetic field.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.086
There is going to be the mother
and father of all power surges.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.834
See this weathervane,
the cock-a-doodle-do?

14:31.913 --> 14:34.132
It's a solar router feeding
the whole factory with solar power.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.585
When that wave hits, kaboom!

14:37.418 --> 14:40.217
I've got to get to that cockerel
before all hell breaks loose.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.424
I never thought
I'd get to say that again.

14:43.508 --> 14:46.352
Amy, breathe.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.855
Yeah. I mean, thanks, I'll try.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.316
Er...

15:51.284 --> 15:52.627
Ow!

16:34.535 --> 16:39.883
Oh! For want of a better word, “Ow”!

16:41.501 --> 16:44.425
Cleaves! You're not in your harness.

16:44.462 --> 16:48.183
- I'm sorry, Doctor. You were right.
- You've lost all power to the factory.

16:48.257 --> 16:52.057
- Doctor, I abandoned my team.
- Then let's go get them.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.474
How long would you say
we were unconscious for, Cleaves?

16:55.556 --> 16:56.808
Not long. A minute, two minutes?

16:56.891 --> 16:58.484
I'd hazard we've been out
a teensy bit longer.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.061
- Well, how long?
- An hour.

17:00.144 --> 17:03.068
I've seen whole worlds turned inside-out
in an hour.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.400
A lot can go wrong in an hour.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.406
I feel like I've been toasted.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.835
- What the hell happened?
- The tsunami happened. You hurt?

17:15.910 --> 17:18.834
It feels like the National Grid's run
through my bones, but apart from that...

17:18.913 --> 17:20.836
I hope the meter's not bust.
I still want to get paid.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.713
- Why...
- Jennifer!

17:23.251 --> 17:27.426
- Jennifer? Hey, all. Right.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.803
- It hurt so much.
- Hey, it's okay. It's over.

17:33.678 --> 17:35.897
- I couldn't get out of my harness.
- Shh, shh, shh.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.145
I thought I was going to die.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.643
Welcome to my world.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.945
Doctor, these are all real people,
so where are their Gangers?

17:50.027 --> 17:52.780
Don't worry. When the link shuts down,
the Gangers return to pure Flesh.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.661
Now, the storm's left us
with acid leaks all over

17:54.740 --> 17:55.832
so we need to contact the mainland.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.376
They can have a rescue shuttle
out here in no time.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.006
That's my record.
Who's playing my record?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.760
- Your Gangers, they've gone walkabout.
- No, it's impossible.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.512
They're not active.
Cars don't fly themselves,

18:11.591 --> 18:14.060
cranes don't lift themselves
and Gangers don't...

18:14.135 --> 18:20.108
# When I said I needed you... #.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.195
- No way.
- I don't...

18:32.278 --> 18:34.155
I... I don't believe this.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.082
They could've escaped
through the service door at the back.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.921
This is just like the Isle of Sheppey.

18:44.040 --> 18:47.419
It would seem the storm
has animated your Gangers.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.219
They've ransacked everything.

18:49.295 --> 18:53.175
- Not ransacked. Searched.
- Through our stuff!

18:53.257 --> 18:54.429
Their stuff.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.135
- Searching for what?
- Confirmation.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.811
They need to know
their memories are real.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.480
Oh, so they've got flaming memories now?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.603
They feel compelled
to connect to their lives.

19:01.682 --> 19:05.107
- Their stolen lives.
- No. Bequeathed. You gave them this.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.780
You poured in your personalities,
emotions, traits, memories,

19:07.855 --> 19:09.482
secrets, everything.
You gave them your lives.

19:09.565 --> 19:12.318
Human lives are amazing.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.614
Are you surprised
they walked off with them?

19:15.696 --> 19:18.165
I'll say it again, Isle of Sheppey.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.119
Ganger got an electric shock,
toddled off, killed his operator

19:21.202 --> 19:23.125
right there in his harness.
I've seen the photos.

19:23.204 --> 19:26.549
- This bloke's ear was all hanging...
- Even if this has actually happened,

19:26.624 --> 19:29.924
they can't remain stable
without us plumbed in to them.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.880
Can they, boss?

19:36.801 --> 19:37.893
Guess we'll find out.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.266
- Are you okay?

19:40.346 --> 19:43.976
- Do you need some water?
- I feel funny.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.810
I need the washroom.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.445
I'll come with you.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.740
- Sorry.
- Oh. That's okay.

19:51.524 --> 19:55.825
That's me. It's good to have a hobby.
So what?

19:56.737 --> 19:58.489
My Ganger did that all on its own?

19:58.572 --> 20:00.290
Who taught you to do this?

20:00.950 --> 20:01.951
My granddad.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.753
Well, your Ganger's granddad
taught him to do it, too.

20:04.995 --> 20:09.341
You both have the same childhood
memories, just as clear, just as real.

20:13.129 --> 20:15.473
- No.
- Scared, disorientated,

20:15.548 --> 20:20.349
struggling to come to terms
with an entire life in their heads.

20:23.514 --> 20:26.859
The Doctor's always saying,
"Don't wander off."

20:26.934 --> 20:30.154
First rule with him, actually,
don't wander off.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.731
I just need a minute.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.535
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Take all the time you need.

20:37.194 --> 20:40.118
I've got your back. You're fine.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.467
Uh, Jennifer?

20:56.088 --> 20:59.262
- What, what's up, Jennifer?

21:00.843 --> 21:02.265
We, uh,

21:05.097 --> 21:06.394
better get going.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.729
Everything okay in there, Jen?

21:16.484 --> 21:21.115
Just let us live!

21:25.534 --> 21:27.377
We need to protect ourselves.

21:29.622 --> 21:33.217
- Are you a violent man, jimmy?
- No.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.469
Then why would the other Jimmy be?

21:35.503 --> 21:37.926
Tell me you can eat
at a time like this, Doctor.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.100
You told me we were out cold
for a few minutes, Cleaves,

21:41.175 --> 21:43.348
when in fact, it was an hour.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.013
Sorry? I just assumed...

21:45.095 --> 21:47.564
Well, it's not your fault.
Like I said, they're disorientated.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.143
Amy, when you got to the alcoves,
who was in harness?

21:50.226 --> 21:53.025
Um, jimmy and Dicken
were helping Buzzer out.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.063
Jennifer?

21:54.146 --> 21:56.399
She was standing on her own
when we got to her.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.033
- It's hot.
- Uh.

22:07.451 --> 22:08.919
Trans-matter's still a little rubbery.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.372
Nerve endings not quite fused properly.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.049
- What are you talking about?
- It's okay.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.222
- Why didn't I feel that?
- You will.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.007
You'll stabilise.

22:22.091 --> 22:24.594
No. Stop it.
You're playing stupid games.

22:24.677 --> 22:25.929
Stop it!

22:32.101 --> 22:38.359
You don't have to hide.
Please, trust me, I'm the Doctor.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.412
Where's the real Cleaves, you thing?

22:43.487 --> 22:45.489
What have you done with her?

22:45.573 --> 22:47.541
That's it. Good, you remember.

22:47.616 --> 22:54.090
This is early Flesh. The early stages
of the technology. So much to learn.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.838
- Doctor, what's happened to her?
- She can't stabilise,

22:56.917 --> 23:00.842
she's shifting between half-formed
and full-formed. For now, at least.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.969
We are living!

23:10.890 --> 23:13.268
- Let her go.
- Doctor, Rory.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.320
- Rory?
- Rory!

23:16.395 --> 23:19.569
Oh, Rory. Rory! Always with the Rory.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.254
Explosion must've ruptured
the acid feeds.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.547
We're going to need the acid suits.

23:35.581 --> 23:38.801
No, no, no. We haven't got time.
Back, back, back!

24:01.148 --> 24:02.274
JENNIFER; Rory!

24:07.488 --> 24:08.614
Rory?

24:12.159 --> 24:13.331
Rory!

24:32.972 --> 24:33.973
Rory.

24:34.056 --> 24:36.479
Of course, Jennifer's a Ganger, too.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.437
Doctor, you said
they wouldn't be violent.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.193
But I did say
they were scared and angry.

24:41.271 --> 24:45.071
And early technology is what you said.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.578
You seem to know something
about the Flesh.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.745
Do you? Doctor?

25:00.290 --> 25:02.088
You're no weatherman.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.469
Why are you really here?

25:04.503 --> 25:07.222
I have to talk to them. I can fix this.

25:08.215 --> 25:11.344
Wait! What's going on?
Where's the real Jennifer?

25:22.479 --> 25:25.232
It is too dangerous out here
with acid leaks.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.441
We have to find Rory.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.948
Yes, I'm going back to the Tardis.
Wait for me in the dining hall.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.702
I want us to keep together, okay?
No more wandering off.

25:31.780 --> 25:32.781
And what about Rory?

25:32.823 --> 25:36.373
Well, it would be safer to look
for Rory and Jennifer with the Tardis.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.584
Here we go.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.667
Distress flares.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.472
- Exit?
- Keep going straight. Can't miss it.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.800
But you're never going to get
your vehicle in here.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.601
I'm a great parker.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.602
Well, we really need those acid suits.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.558
I've sent Buzzer and Dicken to get them.

25:59.641 --> 26:03.987
Fine and dandy. I'm just going to
find my husband. So, cheers.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.820
- Amy, I wouldn't.
- Nor would I.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.651
What can you do, eh?

26:10.360 --> 26:12.658
At least wait for an acid suit!

26:47.397 --> 26:49.399
When I was a little girl,

26:50.526 --> 26:54.247
I got lost on the moors,
wandered off from the picnic.

26:57.407 --> 27:02.254
I can still feel how sore my toes
got inside my red welly boots.

27:04.456 --> 27:09.428
And I imagined another little girl,
just like me, in red wellies.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.555
And she was Jennifer, too.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.513
Except she was a strong Jennifer,

27:17.511 --> 27:19.184
a tough Jennifer.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.564
She'd lead me home.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.920
My name is Jennifer Lucas.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.051
I'm not a factory part.

27:51.378 --> 27:53.551
I had toast for my breakfast.

27:54.756 --> 27:58.511
I wrote a letter to my mum.
And then you arrived.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.848
I noticed your eyes right off.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.267
Did you?

28:05.350 --> 28:09.571
Nice eyes. Kind.

28:13.609 --> 28:15.282
Where's the real Jennifer?

28:16.570 --> 28:19.449
1 am Jennifer Lucas!

28:19.531 --> 28:23.456
I remember everything
that happened in her entire life.

28:23.535 --> 28:28.086
Every birthday, every childhood illness.

28:29.374 --> 28:33.550
I feel everything she has ever felt
and more.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.723
I'm not a monster!

28:35.797 --> 28:40.849
I am me. Me! Me! Me!

28:51.313 --> 28:53.407
Why did they do this to us?

28:55.525 --> 28:59.496
Help me, Rory. Help me.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.534
Shh, shh.

29:32.980 --> 29:34.948
Trust me.

29:37.943 --> 29:41.072
Oh... What are you doing down there?

29:42.948 --> 29:43.949
Ooh.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.661
Ah!

29:53.208 --> 29:56.462
Ah! Oh! Oh! Oh!

29:56.545 --> 29:58.639
Oh! Ah! Ah!

30:01.675 --> 30:02.847
Clear.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.435
Those damn Gangers
got to the acid suits.

30:11.518 --> 30:13.691
There is acid leaking everywhere.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.398
Did you see the boss' eyes
back there in the hall?

30:16.481 --> 30:19.075
I've never seen a Ganger
look at me like that.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.701
I don't know what they are now
but they ain't us.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.109
We have the advantage now.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.660
We have the acid suits.

31:01.735 --> 31:05.330
We can move freely, strike at will.

31:06.365 --> 31:10.586
Are you sure you're feeling better?
No more super-elastic punches?

31:11.536 --> 31:14.585
I'm...different now.

31:14.623 --> 31:18.127
- Stronger.
- The Doctor won't hurt you.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.178
He wants to help, Jennifer. Okay?

31:20.253 --> 31:22.176
You used my name.

31:22.631 --> 31:25.384
You used my name. Thank you.

31:27.803 --> 31:31.979
- Amy's a lucky girl.
- Yeah. She is.

31:35.852 --> 31:37.354
Let's go.

31:53.370 --> 31:56.089
Rory. Rory?

32:22.649 --> 32:26.074
- Amy!
- You're okay.

32:27.487 --> 32:28.955
What happened?

32:31.491 --> 32:34.495
- She needs protecting.
- Jen?

32:34.578 --> 32:36.546
No, it's a Ganger.

32:36.621 --> 32:40.376
- Rory, listen...
- No, you listen! Nobody touches her!

33:09.279 --> 33:11.156
Hello.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.209
- How are you all getting on?
- Why don't you tell us?

33:14.284 --> 33:17.163
Well, we have two choices.
The first is to tear each other apart,

33:17.245 --> 33:21.170
not my favourite. The second is
to knuckle down and work together,

33:21.249 --> 33:24.002
try to work out how
best we can help you.

33:25.962 --> 33:29.466
Now, I know it's hard for you
to hold your fully human form.

33:29.549 --> 33:33.304
That's why you keep shifting
between the Flesh stages. But do try.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.639
It'll make the others
less scared of you.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.617
Where's Jen?
What have you done with her?

33:47.692 --> 33:49.865
I haven't seen her, I swear.

33:50.487 --> 33:54.208
But look, I'm her.
I'm just like her. I'm real.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.750
You're a copy.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.287
You're just pretending to be like her.

33:58.370 --> 34:02.466
Rory, we don't really know anything
about them yet.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.088
- Well...
- And...

34:05.126 --> 34:08.596
I know that she's afraid
and she needs our help.

34:09.255 --> 34:10.257
Rory, would you...

34:10.340 --> 34:13.719
jimmy, Buzzer, come on, you guys.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.020
We've worked together for two years.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.473
1 worked with Jennifer Lucas, not you.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.809
Okay, let's not do anything at all

34:19.891 --> 34:22.895
- until the Doctor gets...
- Until the Doctor gets here. Hello.

34:31.987 --> 34:36.708
- This is...
- You're telling me.

34:36.741 --> 34:40.291
All right, Doctor,
you've brought us together, now what?

34:40.370 --> 34:42.714
Before we do anything,
I have one very important question.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.882
Has anybody got
a pair of shoes I could borrow?

34:44.958 --> 34:48.428
Size 10, although I should
warn you, I have very wide feet.

34:53.425 --> 34:57.805
That's it, Doctor, befriend them,
team up with them, why don't you?

34:57.887 --> 35:00.390
Make a football team. How about that?

35:01.766 --> 35:05.521
You're going to have us all
together singing campfire songs.

35:07.981 --> 35:09.699
The Flesh was never merely moss.

35:09.774 --> 35:12.573
These are not copies.
The storm has hardwired them.

35:12.652 --> 35:15.155
They are becoming people.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.367
- With souls?
- Rubbish!

35:18.450 --> 35:20.327
Bless you.

35:20.410 --> 35:24.256
What? We were all jelly once.
Little jelly eggs sitting in goop.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.004
Yeah, thanks, too much information.

35:26.082 --> 35:28.676
We are not talking about an accident
that needs to be mopped up.

35:28.752 --> 35:32.006
We are talking about sacred life.
Do you understand?

35:32.797 --> 35:36.472
Good. Now, the Tardis is trapped
in an acid pool.

35:36.551 --> 35:37.552
Once I can reach her,

35:37.677 --> 35:41.227
I can get you all off this island,
humans and Gangers. How does that sound?

35:41.306 --> 35:43.308
Can I make it home for Adam's birthday?

35:43.391 --> 35:45.234
What about me?

35:45.310 --> 35:46.857
He's my son, too.

35:46.936 --> 35:50.611
- You? You really think that?
- I feel it.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.488
Oh, so you were there when he was born,
were you?

35:52.567 --> 35:53.739
Yeah.

35:55.236 --> 35:59.036
I drank about eight pints of tea.

35:59.115 --> 36:02.415
Then they told me I had a wee boy
and I just burst out laughing.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.547
No idea why.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.752
I miss home,

36:11.294 --> 36:12.796
as much as you.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.554
Look, I'm not going to lie to you,
it's a right old mess, this.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.560
But as you might say up north,

36:22.639 --> 36:26.064
"Oh, well, I'll just go
to t'foot of stairs."

36:26.101 --> 36:29.696
"Ee by by gum." Or not. Good. Right.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.524
First step is we get everyone together,
then get everyone safe.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.609
Then get everyone out of here.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.866
But we're still missing
Jennifer and Cleaves.

36:36.903 --> 36:38.371
I'll go and look for them.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.745
I'll give you a hand, if you like.

36:43.702 --> 36:46.080
- Cover more ground.
- Yeah.

36:47.247 --> 36:50.672
- Okay. Thanks.
- This circus has gone on long enough!

36:53.044 --> 36:57.094
Oh, great.
You see, that is just so typically me.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.471
Doctor, tell it to shut up!

36:59.551 --> 37:02.771
- Cleaves, no. No, no.
- Circuit probe.

37:02.846 --> 37:05.850
Fires about, oh, 40,000 volts?
Would kill any one of us.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.811
So I guess she'll work on Gangers
just the same.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.521
It's interesting you refer
to them as "it"

37:11.604 --> 37:14.357
but you call a glorified cattle prod
a "she".

37:14.441 --> 37:16.443
When the real people
are safely off this island

37:16.526 --> 37:19.655
then I'll happily talk philosophy
over a pint with you, Doctor.

37:19.738 --> 37:20.990
What are you going to do to them?

37:21.072 --> 37:24.042
Sorry, they're monsters. Mistakes.

37:24.117 --> 37:27.087
- They have to be destroyed.
- Give me the probe, Cleaves.

37:27.162 --> 37:30.132
We always have to take charge,
don't we, Miranda.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.834
Even when we don't really know
what the hell is going on.

37:37.964 --> 37:40.592
Oh! Agh! Dead!

37:40.675 --> 37:43.303
We call it decommissioned.

37:43.386 --> 37:45.388
- You stopped his heart.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.600
He had a heart!

37:47.682 --> 37:52.062
Aorta, valves, a real human heart!

37:53.188 --> 37:55.236
And you stopped it.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.658
- Jen?
- What happened to Buzz

37:56.733 --> 37:58.827
will happen to us all if we trust you!

37:58.860 --> 38:00.737
Wait, wait. Just wait.

38:01.321 --> 38:05.326
- No!

38:05.492 --> 38:08.041
Idiot!

38:08.119 --> 38:09.245
Wait!

38:16.961 --> 38:19.589
Look at what you have done, Cleaves!

38:19.672 --> 38:24.098
If it's war, then it's war.
You don't get it, Doctor.

38:24.177 --> 38:27.397
How can you? It's us and them now.

38:29.390 --> 38:34.066
- Us and them.
- Us and them.

38:38.399 --> 38:41.448
Us and them.

38:45.198 --> 38:49.078
You tried.
We all tried and look what they did.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.581
- Us and them now.
- Us and them.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.086
Us and them.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.043
- Jennifer.
- Buzzer warned you it was a trick

38:57.126 --> 38:58.969
and now he's dead.

38:59.045 --> 39:03.596
If we want to live,
then it's time to go to war.

39:04.926 --> 39:08.146
I'll take care of the spare one
running around out there.

39:30.660 --> 39:36.463
Trust me. Ahhh...

39:37.041 --> 39:38.293
Oh!

39:44.883 --> 39:48.228
- I just wanted to help her.
- Well, we all do, okay?

39:48.261 --> 39:51.686
- Don't be like that. Listen, she's...
- I said I agree with you, so drop it.

39:58.646 --> 40:02.367
The most fortified and defendable room
in the monastery.

40:02.442 --> 40:06.288
Cleaves, the most fortified
and defendable room in the monastery?

40:06.362 --> 40:07.409
- The chapel.
- Thank you.

40:07.488 --> 40:10.867
Only one way in,
stone walls two feet thick.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.873
You've crossed one hell of a line,
Cleaves.

40:12.952 --> 40:16.297
You've killed one of them.
They're coming back.

40:18.625 --> 40:20.172
In a big way.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.732
- Jennifer!
- Rory?

40:51.199 --> 40:52.246
What about the flares?

40:52.325 --> 40:54.248
We'll worry about the flares
when we're locked inside.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.045
- Rory Pond.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.799
- Rory, come on.
- Jen's out there.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.675
She's out there and she's on her own.

41:01.751 --> 41:04.129
Well, if she's got any sense,
then she's hiding. Rory!

41:04.212 --> 41:06.510
- I can't leave her out there!
- Rory!

41:06.589 --> 41:09.433
- I know you understand that.
- Get in here! Get in here!

41:09.509 --> 41:10.806
There they are!

41:11.469 --> 41:13.221
- Amy.
- Ah!

41:14.514 --> 41:15.515
Rory!

41:16.015 --> 41:19.315
Amy, they are not after him,
they're after us.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.022
Why? Why?

41:23.731 --> 41:25.574
Show yourself. Show yourself!

41:28.653 --> 41:29.905
Jennifer.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.706
Doctor, pass me the barrel.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.543
We need something heavy,
anything you can find.

41:43.292 --> 41:47.297
This is insane!
We're fighting ourselves!

41:47.380 --> 41:51.760
Yes, it's insane. And it's about to get
even more insanerer.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.642
- Is that a word?
- Show yourself, right now!

41:54.721 --> 41:57.349
Doctor, we are trapped in here
and Rory's out there with them.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.901
Hello! We can't get to the Tardis
and we can't leave the island.

41:59.976 --> 42:01.899
Correct
in every respect, Pond.

42:01.978 --> 42:04.026
It's frightening, unexpected,

42:04.105 --> 42:07.359
frankly a total,
utter, splattering mess on the carpet.

42:07.442 --> 42:11.743
But I am certain, 100% certain,
that we can work this out.

42:12.447 --> 42:13.744
Trust me.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.035
I'm the Doctor.

42:47.440 --> 42:48.862
I have a plan.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.615
Oh! You're hurting me.

42:51.694 --> 42:54.368
And it'll destroy them all.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.324
Ah! Why?

42:56.407 --> 42:59.251
You're one of us, Doctor.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.125
Nooo!

43:06.584 --> 43:07.585
Oh!
