WEBVTT

00:22.889 --> 00:24.891
Kevin. Steven. Do not give up.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.370
Come on, Steven. You've got to run.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.930
I can't. You have to.

00:29.996 --> 00:31.669
Leave me.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.109
Just go.

00:47.747 --> 00:48.748
Steven!

01:52.745 --> 01:54.122
You sure you don't want a latte?

01:54.180 --> 01:55.591
Yeah, black's good. All right.

01:56.316 --> 01:57.317
If you say so.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.497
You look sort of uncomfortable.

02:01.554 --> 02:03.727
This isn't something you actually
want to talk about, is it?

02:03.790 --> 02:05.497
Well, my aunt, before she died

02:06.559 --> 02:08.401
told me I should break
up with Juliette.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.935
Shouldn't we be talking about this
over a couple of beers at midnight?

02:12.365 --> 02:13.708
I want to tell her Tell her what?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.279
What I can... You know,
how I can see.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.845
Blutbads and Siegbarstes
and Hexenbiests.

02:21.908 --> 02:23.478
Okay, okay, okay. I see where
you're going with this.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.489
Now I definitely
could use that beer.

02:25.912 --> 02:28.483
Look, it's gotten too
dangerous for Juliette.

02:28.748 --> 02:30.887
She has no idea what
I'm dealing with.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.661
And that other night,
when I got attacked in my house...

02:35.355 --> 02:36.493
She could have been killed.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.530
Have you not considered how
you're going to do this?

02:39.592 --> 02:41.594
Well, I was hoping you
could give me some advice.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.038
I mean, haven't you ever had to
explain who you are to anyone?

02:45.298 --> 02:47.744
You mean, like,
a normal person? No.

02:48.334 --> 02:49.642
There's no good outcome to that.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.943
Either they believe you
and think they're crazy

02:52.005 --> 02:55.543
or, far more likely, they don't believe
you and they think you're crazy.

02:55.608 --> 02:57.610
Either way, it puts a
strain on a relationship.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.782
Well, I have to tell her something.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.390
You know, I can't
jeopardize her like this.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.823
Maybe that's why your aunt
told you what you have to do.

03:05.018 --> 03:08.158
Look, isn't there a
way that you could...

03:09.389 --> 03:10.697
You know, Blutbad for her?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.670
Okay. Just hold it.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.498
Given the right circumstances,
you know...

03:15.562 --> 03:17.235
Like, in the heat of the
moment kind of thing...

03:17.297 --> 03:19.675
We can be seen if
we want to be seen.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.611
Which, by the way, accounts for
a great many of your legends.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.106
We would have gotten away
with a lot more bad behavior

03:25.171 --> 03:27.412
if it wasn't for guys like
you Grimms who can see us

03:27.473 --> 03:28.713
when we don't want to be seen.

03:28.775 --> 03:30.880
Okay. So, I could
bring her over here,

03:31.477 --> 03:33.150
and you could, you know,
just a little bit.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.988
No, no, no, no, no.

03:35.715 --> 03:39.891
The vast majority of humans just can't
process that kind of information.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.361
They can believe in
all kinds of stuff.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.798
You know, gods, for example.

03:44.857 --> 03:48.031
Angels and demons and dinosaurs
and the Big Bang Theory

03:48.094 --> 03:49.801
and E equals MC squared, man.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.899
But that's only because it's
not right in front of them.

03:52.232 --> 03:56.044
They're not looking directly into the
boiling core of the raw universe.

03:56.102 --> 03:59.447
So, you know, confronted
with that kind of reality...

04:00.340 --> 04:02.081
A lot of brains just turn to mush.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.378
So, what am I supposed to do?

04:05.044 --> 04:07.251
Like I'm one to give advice.
Come on.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.854
Even a normal
relationship baffles me.

04:17.123 --> 04:18.124
Yeah.

04:18.958 --> 04:22.269
Hey. White male, late teens.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.264
Looks like something
pecked out his eyes.

04:24.931 --> 04:25.966
Any ID?

04:26.032 --> 04:28.376
Nothing on him except for this.
This was in his pocket.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.072
Puka shell necklace.

04:30.136 --> 04:33.549
I haven't seen one of those since I
was in Waikiki on my first honeymoon.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.314
This kid looks like he went
about 50 rounds with Mike Tyson.

04:36.776 --> 04:39.222
Yeah. Fall from the rocks
didn't do him any favors.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.952
The bruising looks post-mortem.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.459
He probably died before he fell.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.058
White fluid in his nostrils and
around the edge of his mouth

04:45.118 --> 04:46.256
would suggest drowning.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.532
Well, he looks pretty pale,
even for death.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.664
Yeah, it could be the cold water.

04:53.993 --> 04:55.097
Yeah, or this.

04:57.730 --> 04:58.731
Oh.

04:59.165 --> 05:01.008
Anybody believe in vampires?

05:04.103 --> 05:05.309
Ha, ha.

05:21.954 --> 05:23.831
I can't tell you exactly what his

05:23.890 --> 05:27.565
hemoglobin or hematocrit
count was before he died.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.005
But by my estimate,
this kid was cruising at about

05:30.063 --> 05:31.303
a fourth of a tank of blood.

05:31.531 --> 05:32.942
So, how many pints down is that?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.304
Oh, seven plus.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.675
Well, could he have
been a hemophiliac?

05:35.735 --> 05:37.612
I tested for that. Nope.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.308
And no drugs in his system, either.

05:39.372 --> 05:40.851
What about the wounds on his neck?

05:40.907 --> 05:41.908
Well...

05:42.842 --> 05:46.517
Well... It could be vampires,
or someone who wants to be a vampire.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.592
Or somebody who wants to
get a lot of blood fast.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.623
These are about the
size of an IV needle.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.391
My hope, it's an IV.

05:53.553 --> 05:56.090
Okay. So, how does a kid get stuck
in the neck with an IV needle

05:56.155 --> 05:57.998
and end up in a river
going over a waterfall?

05:58.424 --> 06:01.234
I saw a lot of this sort
of stuff in the late 80's.

06:01.427 --> 06:03.566
When the Satanic cults
were all the rage.

06:04.630 --> 06:05.802
But not lately.

06:06.466 --> 06:07.604
Maybe they're making a comeback.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.544
So, what killed him? Oh,
he drowned.

06:10.103 --> 06:13.676
But my guess is he drowned because he
was incredibly weak from loss of blood.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.515
So, was it an accident
or a homicide?

06:15.675 --> 06:18.121
Nobody puts IV needles in
their neck by accident.

06:22.648 --> 06:23.820
We've got a hit on the prints.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.562
His name was Steven Bamford.

06:29.622 --> 06:31.329
Eighteen. And he had
a record already.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.894
Shoplifting,
drug possession, B and E.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.671
Last known address,
Portland P.O. box. Zip is downtown.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.943
Check this out. We found the body
here at the base of the falls.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.477
The river above covers miles of
territory with limited land access.

06:44.537 --> 06:46.414
There's no way to tell where
he went into the river.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.782
Okay. We start at the P.O.
box, see if anybody knows him there.

06:48.841 --> 06:50.787
Yeah. Print a few
pictures to take with us.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.160
He rented a box for
about six months.

06:59.318 --> 07:00.456
How often did he pick up his mail?

07:01.020 --> 07:03.796
Every couple of weeks. But I haven't
seen him in at least a month.

07:03.856 --> 07:05.062
He ever come in with anybody?

07:05.124 --> 07:06.626
I never paid attention.

07:06.692 --> 07:08.933
A lot of these street
kids rent boxes from us.

07:09.128 --> 07:12.041
But as long as they pay their bills,
I don't ask any questions.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.509
Thanks. Sure.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.444
Hey, Nick, wait a minute.

07:19.472 --> 07:20.815
Hey, that necklace
you're wearing...

07:21.707 --> 07:23.550
Puka shell, right? Yeah. Why?

07:25.111 --> 07:27.113
You ever seen this kid
around here? You cops?

07:27.180 --> 07:28.625
Don't worry. He hasn't
done anything wrong.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.126
If you've seen him, it's important.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.491
I've seen him around,
but I don't know.

07:31.551 --> 07:32.621
Where did you get the necklace?

07:32.685 --> 07:33.891
I traded for it.

07:34.654 --> 07:35.655
With who?

07:38.057 --> 07:39.934
Look. He's dead.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.902
We're just trying to figure
out what happened to him.

07:45.498 --> 07:48.638
She sells them across from the square.
Her name's Gracie.

07:54.941 --> 07:57.353
Nice necklaces. How much?

07:58.811 --> 08:00.518
I'm not selling them.
They're donation only.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.356
You can give me whatever you
want and take whatever you want.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.656
Okay. So you know we're police.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.924
Look, we're not looking for a
business license or anything here.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.489
We just need a little help.
ls your name Gracie?

08:12.859 --> 08:14.304
Uh, this is Steven Bamford.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.701
You recognize him?

08:23.202 --> 08:25.512
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but we found Steven's body.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.712
Steven's dead?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.046
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.890
Are you sure? We're sure. Sorry.

08:34.947 --> 08:36.051
What are you doing?

08:36.115 --> 08:37.753
Slow down. We're just
asking some questions.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.421
Why? Who are you?

08:39.751 --> 08:41.025
Look, she didn't do anything,
all right?

08:41.087 --> 08:42.293
That's not the question I asked.

08:42.587 --> 08:43.794
He's my brother.

08:45.424 --> 08:46.425
Steven's dead.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.438
They just told me. What?

08:51.063 --> 08:52.906
How did he die? He drowned.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.813
Have any idea how he got into
the river above Triple Falls?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.238
No.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.712
Last thing we knew, he got a job.

09:01.073 --> 09:02.211
What kind of job?

09:02.708 --> 09:04.187
He was doing, like, ranch work.

09:04.744 --> 09:06.018
They were picking
him up or something.

09:06.078 --> 09:07.182
When was that?

09:07.747 --> 09:09.693
Four, five weeks ago.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.792
Do you know where they picked
him up or who picked him up?

09:11.951 --> 09:12.986
No.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.527
When was the last time you saw him?

09:16.322 --> 09:18.131
After we took him to the clinic.

09:19.258 --> 09:20.601
Free clinic on 15th?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.266
Yeah.

09:23.062 --> 09:25.702
Was he involved in
any groups or gangs?

09:26.465 --> 09:27.773
No. Not him.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.740
Being around more than three
people made him uncomfortable.

09:31.804 --> 09:32.942
Well, thank you.

09:42.782 --> 09:43.783
Hey, you know what?

09:45.318 --> 09:47.161
My girlfriend is
going to love this.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.666
Softie.

10:09.475 --> 10:10.510
Hi.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.591
Who gets to talk to the police?

10:13.646 --> 10:15.683
That would be our office
manager, Tom Daniels.

10:15.748 --> 10:16.920
Let me see if he's available.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.932
Tom? Two police officers
here to talk to you.

10:22.321 --> 10:23.994
Uh-huh. Okay.

10:25.224 --> 10:27.932
He's thrilled. Through the door.
I'll buzz you in.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.471
Mmm. Sorry. You've got to eat
when you can around here.

10:33.532 --> 10:35.034
I'm the office manager,
Tom Daniels.

10:35.234 --> 10:36.872
Hey. Oh. Sorry. Again.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.074
What's up?

10:38.237 --> 10:40.581
I'm Detective Griffin.
This is Detective Burkhardt.

10:41.007 --> 10:42.509
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions

10:42.575 --> 10:43.849
about a patient you treated here.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.011
Absolutely.

10:45.077 --> 10:46.886
His name was, uh, Steven Bamford.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.626
Mmm. He looks familiar.

10:49.682 --> 10:51.787
If he's on the streets, I'm sure
he was treated here at some point.

10:51.851 --> 10:53.057
I can check the records.

10:56.889 --> 10:57.924
Yeah.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.765
Looks like we treated
him about five weeks ago

10:59.825 --> 11:02.431
on the 17th for a spider bite.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.638
What did he do? He got killed.

11:06.565 --> 11:09.671
Oh. That's, um, not good.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.309
I'm sorry. Uh,
can I ask what happened?

11:12.371 --> 11:14.180
We're still in the middle
of the investigation.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.514
Who treated him when he came in?

11:15.708 --> 11:18.712
Uh... That would be Dr. Levine.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.018
She's the head of the clinic.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.217
Well, we'd like to talk to her.

11:21.380 --> 11:23.485
Well, she's seeing a patient right now.
This won't take long.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.586
We need to establish
his medical condition

11:25.651 --> 11:27.096
when he came in for his treatment.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.599
No, sure, I understand.
I'll print off the file for her.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.869
Just come back tomorrow
for the results. Mmm.

11:32.925 --> 11:35.269
In the meantime, I am going
to give you some prednisone.

11:35.327 --> 11:37.534
But you need to take it
every day, okay? Okay.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.407
Feel better. Thanks.

11:40.132 --> 11:41.270
Sorry to bother you, Dr. Levine.

11:41.333 --> 11:44.712
These detectives have some questions
about a patient you treated.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.147
I'm going to go finish my lunch.

11:47.306 --> 11:48.307
How can I help?

11:48.441 --> 11:50.182
We found Steven Bamford's body.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.586
Oh, what a shame.
Please don't tell me he OD'd.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.387
No, he drowned, actually.

11:56.148 --> 11:59.129
Anything you can tell us about him?
Medical conditions he might have had?

11:59.585 --> 12:02.862
Well, I don't get to spend much
quality time with my patients.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.500
Looks like I treated
him for a spider bite.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.932
It says here I did a cursory exam.

12:07.993 --> 12:11.031
He seemed to be pretty healthy for
someone who was living on the streets.

12:11.330 --> 12:14.800
I gave him some antibiotics and told
him to check back. He never did.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.778
Did he say anything about
being offered a job?

12:16.836 --> 12:17.837
Not to me.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.213
I'm really sorry.
I wish I could tell you more.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.580
Dr. Levine.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.484
I have a lot of patients
Thank you for your time.

12:28.614 --> 12:31.754
Who offers a street kid a job,
picks him up, and takes him away?

12:31.817 --> 12:33.160
Sounds like migrant labor.

12:33.219 --> 12:34.289
Cash under the table.

12:34.353 --> 12:35.991
Going to be hard to track.

12:36.155 --> 12:37.498
Burkhardt

12:38.424 --> 12:40.062
Motor vehicle accident?
Why do you need us?

12:53.739 --> 12:55.150
Looks like a human heart to me.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.049
That one looks like a liver.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.317
And a lot of blood.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.087
This is not a medical vehicle.

13:01.147 --> 13:04.390
Then, what's it doing transporting
human organs and blood?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.590
Easy. Easy.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.428
Okay. Trauma team, he's yours.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.682
We're not going to
get much out of him.

13:25.738 --> 13:26.910
But we need his phone.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.625
Dead driver's name
is Andrew Probasco.

13:35.681 --> 13:37.661
Born 1932.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.420
And get this. Died in 2005.

13:40.886 --> 13:43.093
So, he died again today.
Apparently.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.329
Fake license? Looks like.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.562
Ironically, he was an organ donor.

13:47.626 --> 13:48.832
Oh.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.168
What about, uh, plates?

13:50.229 --> 13:53.108
Yeah, stolen. Registered to
a Smart car in Tillamook.

13:53.799 --> 13:56.541
Well, I have got expired
lottery tickets.

13:56.969 --> 13:59.176
A "get one free" pizza at Gianni's.

13:59.638 --> 14:01.311
If only he ate six more.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.911
And a credit card in the
name of Hallie Calder.

14:06.078 --> 14:07.785
He didn't look like a Hallie to me.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.986
What about fingerprints? Oh,
funny you should ask.

14:10.950 --> 14:14.022
Got a match on his prints to half
a dozen crimes all over the state,

14:14.086 --> 14:15.190
but no ID.

14:15.254 --> 14:17.131
He was an unknown.
Never been caught.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.230
So, we got nothing.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.900
Are we depressed?

14:23.762 --> 14:25.867
Were you able to get any info
off the driver's cell phone?

14:26.031 --> 14:27.442
Yes. And no.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.637
Can you just give us the yes? No.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.742
Obviously a burner.

14:31.937 --> 14:34.076
But we were still able to
pull the SEN off the SIM card.

14:34.139 --> 14:35.641
Of course, the service
provider will need a warrant

14:35.708 --> 14:38.518
before they release the records.
And that would be up to you.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.286
And that's all you've got?

14:41.347 --> 14:42.690
That's all I got.

14:43.749 --> 14:46.127
You've got a bunch of blood
being illegally transported

14:46.185 --> 14:47.926
and a dead kid missing seven pints.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.332
Maybe we should check to see if
there's a connection between the two.

14:52.424 --> 14:55.428
When we get the DNA results back from
the samples taken at the accident,

14:55.494 --> 14:57.167
let's see if we can
get a match to Steven.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.236
It's worth a shot.

14:59.531 --> 15:00.601
Hmm.

15:01.700 --> 15:04.078
You know, I've been
at this job a while.

15:04.503 --> 15:06.505
But it seems like this town
is just getting weirder.

15:07.806 --> 15:08.876
Hmm.

15:11.343 --> 15:14.449
"Geiers have an innate ability
to move through trees,

15:14.513 --> 15:17.551
"staying above their victims,
who walk beneath them, unaware."

15:24.089 --> 15:25.932
"Geiers are the most vile of all.

15:26.392 --> 15:29.532
"They harvest human organs while
the victims are still alive,

15:30.129 --> 15:33.110
"seeming to take pleasure in
the savage pain they cause.

15:34.867 --> 15:36.904
"Carnage on the front
lines has provided them

15:36.969 --> 15:40.712
"with a seemingly endless supply of
viscera for their terrible trade."

15:48.647 --> 15:50.092
Hey. What are you doing for dinner?

15:50.382 --> 15:53.852
Well, there was a heart, kidney,
liver, gall bladders...

15:54.086 --> 15:56.259
A lot of blood being
transported when he got hit.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.794
Driver had a fake ID.
We can't identify him.

15:58.857 --> 16:01.565
The only thing I know
is he was a Geier.

16:02.227 --> 16:03.763
I saw him right before he died.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.142
What's my favorite color?

16:07.299 --> 16:08.300
What?

16:08.767 --> 16:10.940
You know, you never ask
me about anything else.

16:11.170 --> 16:14.174
Like sports or music or who
the hottest Bond babe was.

16:14.239 --> 16:16.276
You know, like normal conversation?

16:16.842 --> 16:17.843
I'm just saying.

16:17.910 --> 16:19.821
It would be nice to switch it
up once in awhile, you know?

16:20.713 --> 16:23.159
Well... What's your favorite color?

16:25.451 --> 16:26.589
You don't mean that.

16:26.685 --> 16:27.925
No, really. I want to know.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.260
Red.

16:35.594 --> 16:37.096
Well, I feel so much
closer to you now.

16:37.262 --> 16:38.366
Fine.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.110
Yeah. If there are organs involved,

16:41.166 --> 16:43.908
then most likely it
was a Geier deal.

16:43.969 --> 16:45.073
What do you mean, "deal"?

16:45.537 --> 16:48.484
Geiers are like herbalists,
you know?

16:49.074 --> 16:50.212
Eastern medicine types.

16:50.275 --> 16:53.688
You know how some humans
use exotic animal parts

16:53.912 --> 16:56.722
like bear gall bladders and rhino
horns for, like, you know...

16:57.483 --> 17:00.225
Medicinal remedies and
aphrodisiacs and stuff?

17:00.285 --> 17:03.494
Which is ridiculous,
because it has no effect whatsoever.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.429
Here's the thing.

17:05.491 --> 17:08.665
Human parts for
creature enhancement?

17:10.128 --> 17:11.608
That actually works great.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.968
You're serious. Oh, yeah.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.845
Our exotic animals are you.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.651
What, you're telling me that
Geiers deal in human organs?

17:21.807 --> 17:23.411
Well... Okay.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.411
This might be a little awkward.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.287
But, for example, you probably
didn't know that your testicles...

17:29.715 --> 17:33.288
I mean, not your testicles,
specifically,

17:34.053 --> 17:35.896
but that part of the
human male anatomy

17:35.954 --> 17:38.696
has a kind of a Viagra-like
effect on certain species.

17:40.426 --> 17:41.905
Not that I ever had need to...

17:42.227 --> 17:43.570
I mean, everything works great.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.734
Oh, no. That wasn't awkward at all.

17:50.669 --> 17:54.640
Okay, so, where would
someone like you

17:55.908 --> 17:57.387
get something like that?

18:00.612 --> 18:01.716
Um...

18:03.949 --> 18:06.327
There's a place that I've...
I've heard of.

18:08.053 --> 18:10.966
Not that I've ever, you know,
been there. Or anything.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.266
May I help you?

18:21.834 --> 18:22.835
Uh, yeah.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.040
I'm here for the, um...

18:28.340 --> 18:29.546
Catch of the day.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.812
Got some ID?

18:42.254 --> 18:43.927
I haven't had a Blutbad
in here in a long time.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.868
I haven't seen a Fuchsbau
in a Waschbar's age, myself.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.935
What are you looking for? Um...

18:50.062 --> 18:51.598
Maybe a little Gallenblase.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.539
It's fresh, isn't it?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.839
Gallenblase doesn't stay on the
shelf long enough to get old.

18:59.371 --> 19:00.509
Three ounce or the six ounce?

19:00.572 --> 19:02.984
Huh? Oh, it's really for a friend.
So, I don't know.

19:03.542 --> 19:05.488
Um... Six ounce?

19:06.178 --> 19:07.316
I'll be right out.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.726
You want it gift wrapped?
No. Thanks.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.202
If you're partial to mixing,

19:21.994 --> 19:25.908
I find that gall bladder flavor
goes very well with the white tea.

19:27.199 --> 19:28.371
Just the powder, thanks.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.104
That will be $300.

19:32.404 --> 19:33.508
Are you kidding me?

19:34.473 --> 19:36.646
You must not have
bought some in awhile.

19:36.708 --> 19:38.187
The price has been
going through the roof.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.254
Thanks.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.357
You're not going to say that
when you hear the price.

19:50.622 --> 19:51.896
$300.

19:51.957 --> 19:53.334
Are you kidding me?
That's exactly what I said.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.731
How do you know you just
didn't pay $300 for oregano?

19:55.827 --> 19:56.828
I don't know.

19:56.895 --> 19:58.238
Put it in some white
tea and find out.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.536
I think I'll go with the crime lab.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.970
Chicken. By the way,
he's a Fuchsbau.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.980
So, count your fingers
after you shake hands.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.572
Right. Three hundred bucks?

20:05.904 --> 20:07.008
I'll owe you.

20:13.679 --> 20:14.851
You've got a connection.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.626
This confirms that the DNA

20:17.683 --> 20:20.527
from some of the blood in
the S.U.V. matches the kid.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.395
Well, that would explain
the holes in his neck.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.593
Somebody was taking his blood.
And selling it.

20:24.890 --> 20:28.064
But none of the organs in the
S.U.V. match Steven or one another.

20:28.126 --> 20:31.630
So, we've got a lot of blood and a lot of
human body parts from different people.

20:32.731 --> 20:35.871
Somebody has been harvesting human organs,
and not from a hospital.

20:39.504 --> 20:41.006
Check out this histology.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.085
No lesions, fat, cirrhosis,
or pathology of any kind.

20:46.144 --> 20:48.215
Young and healthy.
Perfect specimens. Red market.

20:48.947 --> 20:51.427
They pulled Steven off the street.

20:51.483 --> 20:52.689
Maybe that's where they're
getting their victims.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.628
Homeless kids and runaways.
Nobody would miss them.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.366
Then, we need to run a check.
See if there are any missing street kids.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.534
But there may not be any
missing reports filed.

21:00.058 --> 21:01.833
Let's expand our
search to out of state.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.673
Yeah, Burkhardt.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.370
LAB TECH: I got the report
back on the contents

21:08.433 --> 21:09.969
of that bottle you
wanted identified.

21:10.535 --> 21:12.208
I've got to tell you.
It's a little bizarro.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.942
Pure human gall bladder.
Dried and ground.

21:15.173 --> 21:16.880
Nothing more, nothing less.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.682
Anything else you need to know?

21:19.778 --> 21:21.519
No, that's it. Thank you.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.093
You know what? I'm going to go check
the warrant on that driver's phone.

21:34.059 --> 21:35.800
How are you? I am here for the...

21:37.062 --> 21:38.507
Catch of the day.

21:41.366 --> 21:42.606
Fuchsbau, right?

21:43.001 --> 21:44.173
Oh, my God.

21:44.469 --> 21:45.709
Let's talk about the Gallenblase.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.011
Don't kill me.

21:47.072 --> 21:48.244
Who do you get your
Gallenblase from?

21:48.307 --> 21:49.513
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:49.574 --> 21:50.575
Yeah, you do.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.150
Human gall bladder?

22:04.456 --> 22:05.594
Don't hurt me.
I didn't do anything.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.761
You're selling human organs.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.429
I'm just the shop owner.
I don't kill them myself.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.597
Is that supposed to
make you innocent?

22:09.861 --> 22:11.602
You are going to tell
me everything you know.

22:12.397 --> 22:13.432
The guys will kill me.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.875
Maybe you shouldn't be in
business with them, then.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.704
You can take your chances
with them or with me.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.408
But right now,
I'm here and they're not.

22:23.608 --> 22:25.212
I don't know their names
or where they are.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.915
One of them makes a
delivery once a week.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.048
How do you get in contact with him?

22:28.113 --> 22:29.490
I text him when I need something.

22:30.115 --> 22:31.185
Write down the number.

22:33.985 --> 22:35.794
Same guy makes the
delivery every week?

22:35.854 --> 22:37.197
He's the only one lever saw.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.037
This the guy?

22:41.660 --> 22:42.730
Yes.

22:43.862 --> 22:44.932
When do you see him next?

22:45.197 --> 22:47.438
I was supposed to get a new shipment
yesterday, but he never showed.

22:47.499 --> 22:48.671
Well, that's because he's dead.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.270
Oh, God. You killed him?

22:50.802 --> 22:51.974
Show me the rest of your supply.

23:04.282 --> 23:06.159
You no longer sell human organs.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.565
Yeah, Dispatch,
this is Detective Burkhardt.

23:14.626 --> 23:15.900
I want you to run a number for me.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.565
Go ahead. I'll text it over to you.

23:17.629 --> 23:19.131
And call me when you get something.

23:19.197 --> 23:20.301
Okay, will do.

23:35.847 --> 23:38.487
Wow, it looks like stuff I
used to wear in college.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.029
Where did you get this?

23:40.419 --> 23:43.491
I actually got it from a street
kid I was interviewing on a case.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.426
Mmm. That means there's more to
this than just some cheap gift.

23:48.627 --> 23:51.369
Uh, that actually cost me $20.

23:52.197 --> 23:53.642
You softie.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.736
You know, actually
I was thinking...

23:57.803 --> 24:00.181
Maybe for dinner tonight,
we could, uh...

24:01.807 --> 24:03.480
Uh-huh. Where are
we taking this kid?

24:03.542 --> 24:06.022
It's actually two kids.
A brother and a sister.

24:06.244 --> 24:09.418
Living on the streets? That's so sad.
How old are they?

24:10.015 --> 24:11.289
Still in their teens.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.354
Well, do you even know
where to find them?

24:14.419 --> 24:15.523
I think I do.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.834
Okay. Well, let's get going.
I'm hungry.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.365
You're sure you're okay with this?

24:21.993 --> 24:24.098
Well, I can't exactly
let you go alone.

24:24.162 --> 24:26.073
There's no telling
what you might buy.

24:35.674 --> 24:37.210
Gracie? Hanson.

24:38.944 --> 24:40.252
Uh, this is Juliette.

24:41.012 --> 24:42.923
Hi. I really love the necklace.

24:43.248 --> 24:44.454
You made it, right?

24:45.650 --> 24:47.186
What do you want? Hanson.

24:47.786 --> 24:49.094
He's not here by accident.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.395
I just want to figure out what
happened to your friend Steven.

24:52.190 --> 24:55.171
And Juliette and I are going to go grab a
bite to eat, if you want to come along.

24:55.227 --> 24:56.535
We can take care of ourselves.

24:56.595 --> 24:57.801
Speak for yourself.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.331
I'm going.

25:00.599 --> 25:01.600
Yeah, I'm going.

25:02.901 --> 25:04.005
Do you need any help?

25:04.669 --> 25:06.649
No. I've got it.

25:17.215 --> 25:18.216
Where are you guys from?

25:18.950 --> 25:20.122
Idaho.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.664
Oh, I've been to Idaho.
Whereabouts?

25:22.087 --> 25:23.930
Near Pocatello.
Why do you want to know?

25:25.257 --> 25:27.168
Sorry. Hanson doesn't
really trust police.

25:27.759 --> 25:30.035
That's cool. He actually
had to win me over, too.

25:30.095 --> 25:31.130
Ah. Hmm.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.335
Thanks for the food.

25:33.398 --> 25:35.708
I know you're probably wondering
why we're living on the streets.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.138
It's pretty simple.
Our parents sucked.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.705
Gracie, you don't have
to tell them anything.

25:39.771 --> 25:40.772
No, you don't.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.710
Look, I just wanna know if you know
anybody else like Steven who disappeared.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.983
People come and go all the time.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.082
Yeah, but did anybody get
jobs and never come back?

25:49.414 --> 25:50.415
Yeah. Kevin.

25:51.016 --> 25:53.257
He left about four
weeks ago with Steven.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.895
All right. Did he say
anything before he left?

25:56.588 --> 25:59.194
Anything about the job
where he was going...

25:59.558 --> 26:01.504
He just said it was going to pay,
like, 10 bucks an hour.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.601
Either of you offered jobs? No.

26:05.430 --> 26:09.003
Did Kevin or Steven, uh,
mention how they found out about this job?

26:10.235 --> 26:12.010
Yeah, Kevin said some
guy in a white van

26:12.070 --> 26:13.674
just came up to him in the street.

26:13.738 --> 26:14.739
What street?

26:15.974 --> 26:17.009
I don't know.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.213
You ever seen this white van?

26:20.278 --> 26:21.518
Mmm-mmm.

26:23.148 --> 26:25.128
What was, uh, Kevin's last name?

26:25.684 --> 26:27.163
Standish.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.363
You liked Kevin, didn't you?

26:32.924 --> 26:34.232
Yeah, I did.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.201
You must miss him.

26:37.862 --> 26:40.069
When he left with Steven,
did he ask you to go with him?

26:44.202 --> 26:45.203
Yes.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.848
You never told me that.

26:48.006 --> 26:51.010
I wasn't going to leave you.
You were sick.

26:51.309 --> 26:54.347
Did Kevin say anything
at all when he left?

26:54.913 --> 26:58.554
Yeah, he said he was going to call and
leave me a message at the shelter.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.358
But he never did.

27:03.388 --> 27:06.460
All right, look. If either of
you ever see this white van,

27:06.524 --> 27:07.594
you think you can call me?

27:07.659 --> 27:11.698
Yeah. Yeah. Got to go,
so... Thanks for the food.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.535
Bye.

27:20.905 --> 27:22.907
Thank you. You're welcome.

27:24.509 --> 27:26.455
You know, you're
pretty good at this.

27:26.511 --> 27:27.546
You should have been a cop.

27:27.612 --> 27:29.717
No, it's just girl instinct.

27:31.282 --> 27:34.354
I know what it's like to have a
guy disappear and not call you.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.136
I feel sorry for those kids.

27:40.191 --> 27:41.693
Yeah, so do I.

27:43.895 --> 27:45.397
And I owe you a better date night.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.807
No, you don't. That was fine.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.972
Anyway, we still have
time for dessert.

27:55.907 --> 27:56.908
What?

28:04.149 --> 28:05.219
I love you.

28:05.850 --> 28:06.885
Burkhardt

28:06.951 --> 28:08.953
I've got an address on
that phone number you sent.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.432
Yeah, what have you got?
21343 Murtaugh Road.

28:11.489 --> 28:13.833
21343 Murtaugh Road?

28:13.892 --> 28:14.996
Yeah.

28:17.395 --> 28:18.635
All right, got it.

28:24.602 --> 28:27.048
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you what Kevin said to me.

28:27.105 --> 28:28.140
It's okay.

28:29.774 --> 28:31.776
I wouldn't have left you.

28:32.477 --> 28:34.650
Look. I know. I know.

28:36.114 --> 28:37.889
You think he's okay?

28:38.750 --> 28:41.959
Yeah. Yeah. He's okay.

29:03.208 --> 29:06.678
A hundred and one.
I'd tell you to stay in bed, but...

29:07.378 --> 29:08.721
I'm going to give you
some antibiotics.

29:08.780 --> 29:11.784
And if your throat gets worse,
you need to take them.

29:11.850 --> 29:12.885
You can do that, right?

29:12.951 --> 29:14.487
Yes.

29:14.552 --> 29:16.793
You still selling
those shell necklaces?

29:16.855 --> 29:18.163
Yeah. You want another one?

29:18.656 --> 29:23.366
Um, maybe next time.
Where's your brother?

29:23.428 --> 29:24.873
Outside waiting for me.

29:25.830 --> 29:27.503
And when was the last time you ate?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.271
Last night.

29:29.334 --> 29:30.813
What about this morning?

29:30.869 --> 29:32.576
I ate a lot last night.

29:32.637 --> 29:35.015
A detective took me out for dinner.

29:35.073 --> 29:37.883
I had a steak and some fries.

29:37.942 --> 29:39.444
A detective took you to dinner?

29:39.844 --> 29:40.982
Me and my brother.

29:41.045 --> 29:43.355
He's trying to find out what
happened to Steven and Kevin.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.955
I know you probably don't
remember them, but...

29:46.017 --> 29:48.361
Anyway, Steven is dead now. So...

29:49.220 --> 29:53.726
He's trying to find out, uh,
if we know anyone else who got jobs.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.066
Well, do you?

29:55.126 --> 29:59.199
I don't know. I just said that they
got jobs from somebody in a white van

29:59.264 --> 30:00.868
and I'm supposed to
call if I see it.

30:01.566 --> 30:03.546
Well, I just want you
to stay out of the rain.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.012
I don't want you to get pneumonia.

30:05.470 --> 30:09.111
And take these twice a day with food,
if you can find some.

30:09.707 --> 30:10.777
Thanks, Doctor.

30:14.345 --> 30:17.622
Kevin Standish was reported missing
from Cody, Wyoming, May of last year.

30:17.682 --> 30:21.323
Apparently, he left Portland the
same night Steven did in a white van.

30:21.386 --> 30:23.059
Steven turns up dead,
and Kevin is still missing.

30:23.121 --> 30:24.657
That's what it looks like.

30:24.722 --> 30:26.668
If someone is operating on these kids,
where are they doing it?

30:26.724 --> 30:29.637
We don't know. But we have
information from the driver's phone.

30:29.694 --> 30:32.300
Well, believe it or not, there was
only one number ever dialed from it.

30:32.363 --> 30:33.569
And dialed a lot.

30:33.631 --> 30:37.135
We triangulated it down to a radius
of 1,000 feet northwest of town.

30:37.202 --> 30:38.340
Pretty remote area.

30:38.403 --> 30:42.078
Closest address hit was
21343 Murtaugh Road.

30:42.473 --> 30:43.952
If someone is dealing
in stolen body parts,

30:44.008 --> 30:46.682
there's going to be a lot of
families who want answers.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.150
I'm going with you
guys on this one.

30:56.087 --> 30:58.931
I don't like the
looks of this place.

31:12.403 --> 31:13.473
Portland P.D.

31:17.408 --> 31:19.149
We have a warrant. Open up.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.643
We've got some kind of
greenhouse out here.

32:26.511 --> 32:27.546
Oh.

32:29.047 --> 32:30.549
What the hell?

32:46.297 --> 32:51.679
These are human organs.
Hearts, gall bladders, kidneys.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.208
This is unbelievable.

32:59.043 --> 33:02.047
Why would you dry them out instead
of selling them for transplant?

33:03.214 --> 33:07.287
Some cultures use animal organs to
make medicines and aphrodisiacs.

33:09.887 --> 33:12.163
Bear gall bladder, rhino horn.

33:12.457 --> 33:15.563
So, what, if animal liver is good,
a human one must be better?

33:15.626 --> 33:18.539
Well, whichever way you look at it,
it's still cannibalism.

33:18.596 --> 33:21.236
Uh, I think it's
pronounced capitalism.

33:44.589 --> 33:47.433
Folter Clinic.
How may I direct your call?

33:48.292 --> 33:50.636
Who is it? It's the clinic.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.706
You're going to the
shelter tonight.

33:56.768 --> 33:57.769
Not without you.

33:57.835 --> 33:59.542
You're the one who's sick. Not me.

33:59.604 --> 34:01.515
I'm not going there alone.

34:01.572 --> 34:04.451
Hey. You're the girl
that sells the necklaces.

34:05.676 --> 34:06.711
Yeah.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.281
Oh. Well, I'd sure like to
buy a couple. Is it too late?

34:09.347 --> 34:11.623
No. They're in my pack.
I've just got to get them out.

34:12.617 --> 34:13.891
You're Hanson, right?

34:13.951 --> 34:14.952
Yeah.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.929
I thought I recognized
you from the clinic.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.760
What are you doing?

34:24.161 --> 34:25.732
Hurry up. Get them inside.

34:28.299 --> 34:29.369
Go!

34:52.255 --> 34:54.600
Where are we? GRACIE: Let go of me.
Where are we going?

34:54.659 --> 34:56.195
Get them inside. Hanson.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.671
What are you doing? Here we go.

34:57.728 --> 34:59.071
Gracie.

35:12.143 --> 35:15.090
People will find us. You're not
going to get away with this.

35:15.146 --> 35:17.717
- You can't do this.
- Move it.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.022
Move it.

35:19.584 --> 35:20.585
Let go.

35:38.469 --> 35:39.812
We have a warrant to
search the premises.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.509
There's nobody here.
Everybody has gone home.

35:41.572 --> 35:42.983
Open it up or we'll break it down.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.233
They're not operating
on anybody here.

36:00.291 --> 36:02.601
There's got to be another place.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.197
Let me talk to her.

36:09.233 --> 36:11.509
Look at me. Very closely.

36:12.670 --> 36:13.740
I know what you are.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.078
I don't know what you're...
You're a Geier.

36:15.139 --> 36:16.413
Oh, my God. Where are the kids?

36:16.474 --> 36:17.475
I...

36:17.542 --> 36:20.682
I'm not asking you as a cop,
so don't expect me to behave like one.

36:27.285 --> 36:29.287
FEMALE ASSISTANT: Got it.

36:29.921 --> 36:30.956
We got them.

36:32.156 --> 36:33.226
Where are they?

36:33.291 --> 36:35.965
Getting prepped. I didn't
think you'd want to wait.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.973
I don't. We'll do them next.

37:05.923 --> 37:08.233
Let's start with the girl first.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.380
We finish up tonight's work,
and that's it.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.786
I can have the trucks
here by the morning.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.324
And what about the
records at the clinic?

38:02.380 --> 38:05.190
Everything that matters has been
destroyed. We're good to go.

38:05.249 --> 38:07.286
Gracie. Please.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.189
No.

38:10.421 --> 38:11.525
I'll take care of this.

38:16.761 --> 38:18.672
No. Please.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.971
So much for the surprise!

38:28.072 --> 38:29.073
Police!

38:40.251 --> 38:41.992
I got this. Get her.

40:33.164 --> 40:34.370
Gracie?

40:35.232 --> 40:36.267
Gracie, can you hear me?

40:38.269 --> 40:40.715
Hey. Everything's okay.

40:41.839 --> 40:43.079
It's all going to be okay now.

40:43.574 --> 40:44.609
Where's Hanson?

40:44.675 --> 40:46.177
Hanson's fine.

40:47.978 --> 40:49.184
I saw Kevin. He's here.

40:49.246 --> 40:50.247
We have Kevin.

40:51.982 --> 40:53.359
How did you find us?

41:19.510 --> 41:22.218
This town is definitely
getting weirder.

41:54.845 --> 41:55.846
Hello.

41:55.913 --> 41:58.154
Did you get your present?

41:59.550 --> 42:00.961
Where should I send
the thank-you note?

42:01.018 --> 42:03.726
You made your point.
Now, we are making ours.

42:03.787 --> 42:06.825
The world is becoming
more complicated.

42:06.891 --> 42:08.529
Only for the simple minded.

42:08.592 --> 42:12.301
You are going to have to control
this Grimm or get rid of him.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.809
What I do and how I do it
are none of your concern.

42:14.865 --> 42:17.846
I speak for the Verrat,
and they have a different opinion.

42:17.902 --> 42:20.405
Things are getting out of balance.

42:20.471 --> 42:24.442
A Grimm on his own is like
a samurai without a master.

42:24.508 --> 42:27.011
Well, this one has a
badge and a conscience.

42:27.077 --> 42:28.886
That is your problem.

42:29.680 --> 42:33.651
You know, next time, you might want
to deliver your message in person.

42:33.717 --> 42:36.323
Next time we will.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
