It's audition week for

The one time of year
that people come together

00:44.453 --> 00:46.953
and break into song
for no justifiable reason.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.213
That actually happened a lot

00:48.365 --> 00:49.940
when I did
the Mammary Jamboree in '98.

to get back to the topic
at hand, which is<i> moi,</i>

01:00.227 --> 01:01.952
my beloved teacher, Mrs. Frio,

01:01.970 --> 01:05.213
always writes the musical,
and I don't want to brag but...

01:05.232 --> 01:06.565
You absolutely want to brag.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.049
I always get the lead.

01:08.127 --> 01:10.718
This year, Mrs. Frio
has written a real doozy.

01:10.813 --> 01:12.979
<i>The Ideal Hurricane: The Musical</i>
<i> based on The Perfect Storm,</i>

01:13.074 --> 01:15.132
the movie starring George
Clooney and Mark Wahlberg,

01:15.225 --> 01:16.742
which is based on the book
of the same name

01:16.893 --> 01:19.970
based on the real-life story of
the shipwreck of the<i> Andrea Gail</i>

01:20.063 --> 01:21.080
off the Massachusetts coast.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.973
Rolls right off the tongue.

01:22.991 --> 01:25.342
And speaking of rolling
off the tongue,

01:25.344 --> 01:26.919
I'm hoping there's
a certain someone

01:27.146 --> 01:28.662
who will be cast
opposite me as the lead.

01:28.814 --> 01:31.315
Wait, you're not talking
about Steven Huang are you?

01:31.333 --> 01:33.575
Yes. Steven and I have
such a rich "kiss-tory."

01:33.594 --> 01:35.577
I mean, we tried to kiss,
then we really kissed,

01:35.596 --> 01:37.671
and then it just
fizzled out, I guess.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.157
But, Judy, Steven is dating
that girl Chrissy now,

01:40.175 --> 01:41.325
who plays volleyball, right?

01:41.343 --> 01:42.843
Yes, and I would
never break them up,

01:42.937 --> 01:45.512
but if Steven and I were cast
as the leads in the play,

01:45.664 --> 01:47.998
and the romance of the theater
just happens to overtake us,

01:48.091 --> 01:50.776
well, then, you know, so be it.
(laughs) Okay.

01:50.927 --> 01:52.502
I got to go do
my vocal warm-ups.

01:52.596 --> 01:55.188
Ask me about Alaska's
fattest cats in baskets.

01:55.341 --> 01:56.506
<i> RUSSELL:</i>
<i> And I put the fire out,</i>

01:56.600 --> 01:58.675
but my mom and Jamie
had to come home early

01:58.768 --> 02:00.010
from their wine and paint night.

02:00.028 --> 02:02.512
I know I shouldn't
wrap hot dogs in tin foil

02:02.531 --> 02:04.014
before I put them
in the microwave,

02:04.032 --> 02:05.682
but they just
taste better that way.

02:05.701 --> 02:08.276
Wait, you get to stay home alone
when your mom goes out?

02:08.295 --> 02:10.036
Has your dad never left you
home alone, Moon?

02:10.131 --> 02:12.798
No, but there are a lot
of people in my family.

02:12.949 --> 02:14.708
They're never all gone
at the same time.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.209
I stay home alone once a week.

02:16.362 --> 02:18.303
I get to watch something
rated TV-14.

02:18.455 --> 02:20.622
I'm really into
<i> Chicago's Finest.</i>

02:20.641 --> 02:22.790
Oh, hey, Steven. (chuckles)

02:22.810 --> 02:25.035
Are you, uh, here to audition

02:25.053 --> 02:27.128
for the, uh, musical? (laughs)

02:27.148 --> 02:28.889
Uh, yeah. How about you?

02:29.041 --> 02:31.708
I'm hoping I get the female
lead, the role of Diana Lane.

02:31.727 --> 02:34.044
I assume you're auditioning
for the male lead,

02:34.062 --> 02:35.228
-Martin Whalburg?
-Yeah.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.822
Are you coming in?
'Cause we could, um,

02:37.049 --> 02:38.382
sit together or-or...

02:38.475 --> 02:40.233
Oh, actually, I'm waiting
for Chrissy, my girlfriend.

02:40.402 --> 02:41.385
She's auditioning, too.

02:41.478 --> 02:43.645
Oh, wonderful! Right, of course.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.906
That's great, in fact.
And a congratulations.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.743

GIBBONS:
Welcome, students,

02:51.397 --> 02:53.154
to this year's auditions
for the spring musical,

02:53.174 --> 02:54.564
<i> The Ideal Hurricane.</i>

02:54.583 --> 02:57.067
Unfortunately,
Mrs. Frio is no longer able

02:57.085 --> 02:58.510
to direct the musical she wrote.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.904
She found out last night
that she was placed

03:00.997 --> 03:03.073
in a very high-profile jury.

03:03.091 --> 03:04.591
I can't say anything specific,

03:04.743 --> 03:07.352
but next year's musical may
be about the multiple homicide

03:07.521 --> 03:10.597
in the Wondering Whale
Apartments in Ketchikan.

03:10.691 --> 03:14.418
Luckily, Ms. McNamara has
graciously offered to step in.

03:14.511 --> 03:15.602
The guidance counselor?

03:15.754 --> 03:17.437
Ugh. I had to see her
when I started here.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.105
She told me to get out
of my comfort zone,

03:19.274 --> 03:20.532
so, instead of answering,

03:20.609 --> 03:23.184
I just did a very loud fart
and then left,

03:23.278 --> 03:25.370
and I've never heard
from her again.

03:25.522 --> 03:27.447
Hello, students.
You're probably wondering,

03:27.599 --> 03:30.100
"Hey, what is the
guidance counselor doing

03:30.193 --> 03:31.693
directing a musical?" (laughs)

03:31.861 --> 03:34.287
Although I have no experience
directing theater,

03:34.364 --> 03:36.882
I do have experience
helping students shine.

03:37.033 --> 03:40.126
And remember, you can't spell
"guidance" without "dance."

03:40.203 --> 03:42.203
-Oof.
-All right, let's go ahead

03:42.297 --> 03:43.613
and get the tryouts started.

05:13.722 --> 05:15.647
I mean, I really dropped in
during my monologue.

It was like I was actually
bringing chowder

05:17.634 --> 05:19.133
to a card game
on the docks, you know?

05:19.153 --> 05:20.802
I am looking forward
to helping out

05:20.821 --> 05:22.487
with the sets again this year.

05:22.639 --> 05:25.473
I loved building the giant ants
for<i> Honey I Shrunk the Cast,</i>

05:25.492 --> 05:28.160
but to get to build
an actual boat? (giggles)

05:28.311 --> 05:30.070
It's gonna be like
it's my birthday all month.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.480
And I'm excited because
our videography company,

05:32.499 --> 05:35.058
Pause For Applause, is finally
doing a concert film.

05:35.077 --> 05:37.077
And when we're done,
we'll be selling those DVDs

05:37.229 --> 05:39.079
to proud parents for $15.95.

05:39.231 --> 05:42.582
Sign me up for two, one to watch
and one to be buried with.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.570
Principal Gibbons said I can do
a hurri-cakes concession stand.

05:46.588 --> 05:49.072
And Moon and I will be in
the audience front and center.

05:49.091 --> 05:50.682
(clears throat)
Actually, Father,

05:50.834 --> 05:53.852
it has come to my attention that
I'm the only one of my friends

05:53.929 --> 05:56.170
who has not been allowed
to stay home alone.

05:56.339 --> 05:58.357
Perhaps opening night
of the musical

05:58.508 --> 06:01.768
would be an ideal time
for me to test the waters.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.604
I'll need to see a full
presentation of your plans.

06:04.756 --> 06:06.256
Of course. And don't worry,

06:06.349 --> 06:07.515
while I'll be missing
opening night,

06:07.534 --> 06:10.369
I'll be front and center
at the Saturday matinee.

06:10.596 --> 06:12.371
Hooray, hooray,
for a "sat-inay."

06:12.522 --> 06:14.781
All right, thank you all
for auditioning.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.600
When I call your name,
step forward.

06:16.618 --> 06:19.119
What happened to just posting
a list on the bulletin board?

06:19.271 --> 06:22.122
I really perfected
my surprised but humble face.

06:22.198 --> 06:23.215
First up, Steven Huang.

06:23.366 --> 06:25.032
You will be our Martin Whalburg.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.292
Oh, wow, thanks.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.444
Great choice.

06:27.537 --> 06:29.888
Crispin will be
our Captain Clooney.

06:30.039 --> 06:32.039
And... as our female lead,

06:32.134 --> 06:34.300
Diana Lane... Chrissy Carr.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.209
-(gasps)
-What?

06:35.303 --> 06:37.545
Step forward. Congratulations,

06:37.564 --> 06:40.790
you will be playing
the female lead, Diana Lane.

06:40.792 --> 06:41.808
What?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.902
(echoing):
Gill Beavers, Stool One.

06:44.053 --> 06:46.479
Fred Lombard, understudying.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.148
And finally, Judy Tobin.

06:48.300 --> 06:52.059
You will have a very important
role as Chrissy's understudy.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.136
Understudy?

06:53.229 --> 06:54.638
Oh, and a stool.

06:54.656 --> 06:56.139
-A stool?
-GILL: Oh, wow!

06:56.232 --> 06:59.709
Judy, we're both playing stools.
Be stool, my heart.

07:03.832 --> 07:05.649
Ooh, look at that,
right on time.

07:05.742 --> 07:06.741
Nailed it, Dad.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.576
I will pick you two up
after school.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.321
And, Judy, I will circle back
to get you post-rehearsal.

07:11.414 --> 07:12.413
Yeah, okay.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.157
You thinking about going
to school, Judy?

07:14.176 --> 07:16.101
It's just...
we start rehearsals today,

07:16.252 --> 07:18.845
and I don't even have a line.
I'm playing a stool.

07:18.939 --> 07:22.348
Huh, well, stools
are an important part

07:22.501 --> 07:23.608
of sitting culture.

07:23.835 --> 07:26.761
Yes, I know, but I'm used to
being the lead, Dad.

07:26.855 --> 07:29.430
Ms. McNamara looked
right past me. I don't get it.

07:29.524 --> 07:31.616
Well, we have a saying
in the fishing business,

07:31.785 --> 07:34.786
"There are no small fish,
only small catchers."

07:34.938 --> 07:36.696
So, you got
a tiny fish this time.

07:36.848 --> 07:39.199
There's probably still some
good nutrition on its bones,

07:39.351 --> 07:41.017
and if you wait around
for a bigger one,

07:41.036 --> 07:42.368
you might starve to death.

07:42.521 --> 07:44.779
You know, you're right, Dad.
If I have to be a stool,

07:44.798 --> 07:46.539
I'm gonna be the stool
that stands out,

07:46.633 --> 07:49.192
or sits out.
I'm just gonna... stool it.

07:49.285 --> 07:50.860
Well, that's
a great "atti-Jude."

07:50.879 --> 07:54.639
I know you're gonna be the most
solid stool on that stage.

07:54.791 --> 07:57.124
(Boston accent):
I always find the fish, always.

07:57.293 --> 07:58.510
Even when it's hard.

07:58.662 --> 08:00.203
(Boston accent):

08:08.489 --> 08:09.229
Yes, Judy?

08:09.381 --> 08:10.638
You say "cut" for film.

08:10.732 --> 08:12.306
In the theater, we say "hold."

08:12.326 --> 08:13.307

I'm just not ready to sing

Uh, Ms. McNamara, I invented
a backstory for my stool.

08:32.738 --> 08:34.346
I was carved from an oak

who lived in a shaded grove
for 100 years.

and sit on Judy.

-And, Steven,
you'll sit on Gill.

08:42.247 --> 08:44.581
And now, Steven,
grab Chrissy's hand

08:44.583 --> 08:46.432
and look deep
into each other's eyes.

Also... (clears throat)

10:02.828 --> 10:05.678
you'd never use a pivoting-fluke

gives me an idea.

the pivoting fluke anchor,"

"Could be dangerous."

11:27.837 --> 11:28.912
Yes, as Chrissy's understudy,

11:28.930 --> 11:30.596

my vocal exercises

11:30.749 --> 11:32.006
and drinking throat-coat tea

11:32.100 --> 11:33.525
because this is
my musical instrument,

So, if Chrissy feels she cannot

11:36.029 --> 11:37.195
-do the part, of course I can.
-Judy.

11:37.272 --> 11:39.364
Judy! What I was
going to say is,

11:39.515 --> 11:41.533
Judy, let's have you sing
all of Chrissy's songs

Chrissy lip-syncs them onstage.

-Chrissy's doing
fine with her lines,

11:46.932 --> 11:48.707
and now the songs
will be great, too.

11:48.934 --> 11:50.950
-But...
-Uh, Ms. McNamara, how do you
like this for Mr. Tobin?

11:51.102 --> 11:53.027
I could take the parrot
off his shoulder,

11:53.121 --> 11:54.379

<i> Home Alone, 127 Hours,</i>

14:26.700 --> 14:28.941

all around the house,

14:29.094 --> 14:30.776
packed water and snacks
in my backpack

14:30.871 --> 14:32.370

14:39.028 --> 14:40.436

that Steven Huang

15:01.884 --> 15:03.960
were snow machining when an elk
stepped into their path.

-BOTH: Oh, no, Steven!
-MS. McNAMARA: They're
basically fine,

15:05.906 --> 15:08.740
but Fred has a concussion, and
Steven sprained both of his feet

15:08.967 --> 15:10.891
-and cannot dance or stand.
-(all gasp)

15:10.911 --> 15:13.411

Well, there's no getting out
of here. I'm just that good.

15:47.304 --> 15:48.947
<i> (cast murmuring)</i>

15:49.174 --> 15:50.431
Well, I guess I'll go out

15:50.450 --> 15:52.116
and tell the audience
the show is canceled.

15:52.343 --> 15:53.693
Ms. McNamara, wait. I...

15:53.787 --> 15:56.454
actually know all of Steven's
lines and all of his songs.

15:56.605 --> 15:58.681
-You do?
-Yes, and everyone else's lines

15:58.700 --> 16:01.017
and all the choreography,
and I memorized the program.

16:01.035 --> 16:02.961
What I'm saying is,
I can go on for Steven.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.112
But you're supposed to sing
for Chrissy from the pit.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.540
Right, and I can still
sing her song, but onstage.

16:07.692 --> 16:09.616
I'll just turn my head
upstage like this,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.910
-and Chrissy can move her mouth.
-Amazing choice.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.379
So, instead of singing
in the pit,

16:13.531 --> 16:15.198
I'm going to be singing
both leads

16:15.216 --> 16:16.975
onstage in front of everyone.

16:17.126 --> 16:18.643
Yes, I guess you would be,

16:18.870 --> 16:21.145
and getting all the
attention you were craving.

16:21.222 --> 16:24.983
(chuckles) Well, does everyone
want to go ahead with the show?

16:25.134 --> 16:26.392
(overlapping agreement)

16:26.486 --> 16:28.135
-Okay, then.
-Places, everyone.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.304
Places, everyone. Why are
you all just standing here?

16:30.473 --> 16:33.157
Stools, get onstage and crouch.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.146
-Drop the pivoting fluke anchor.
-Could be dangerous.

16:39.315 --> 16:40.890
-Get it, Beef.
-(whoops) That's my dad!

16:40.983 --> 16:44.243
Martin, why don't you go grab
two more nets from the dock?

16:44.395 --> 16:46.504
Whatever you need, Cap.
I'm on it.

16:46.655 --> 16:48.322
Remember, we got a boat
to get ready,

16:48.416 --> 16:50.508
so no sneaking around
with your girl.

16:50.659 --> 16:52.235

JUDY:
Hey, Chrissy, there you are.

17:38.116 --> 17:39.782
I know we have to be on
for the finale soon,

17:39.801 --> 17:42.042
but I just wanted to tell you
how great you were out there.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.469
We made such a great team.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.805
You know, I actually
almost did something tonight

17:45.899 --> 17:47.381
that would've
hurt your feelings,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.142
and I'm really glad
that I didn't because...

17:50.236 --> 17:52.010
Wait, are you crying?

17:52.163 --> 17:53.404
(crying)

17:53.631 --> 17:55.573
Why didn't you just let
Ms. McNamara cancel the show?

17:55.724 --> 17:58.392
Now Steven saw you do
his part and my part.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.727
He's probably going to fall back
in love with you.

18:00.805 --> 18:04.082
Me? No. Steven likes you.
What are you talking about?

18:04.233 --> 18:06.900
This whole thing has just been
so humiliating for me.

18:06.994 --> 18:08.902
I mean, I just auditioned
to have something

18:09.071 --> 18:10.162
to do with Steven for fun,

18:10.256 --> 18:11.923
since it's not volleyball
season right now,

18:12.074 --> 18:14.575
and then Ms. McNamara
gave me the lead,

18:14.594 --> 18:15.909
which I didn't even want.

18:16.003 --> 18:17.169
Then she made me sing
in front of people,

18:17.322 --> 18:18.596
even though I cannot sing.

18:18.823 --> 18:20.323
And then she gave my song

18:20.341 --> 18:22.416
to my boyfriend's beautiful and
talented kind of ex-girlfriend,

18:22.435 --> 18:24.102
and everything
was just like a...

18:24.329 --> 18:26.011
like a... a perfect storm.

18:26.164 --> 18:29.332
Huh. I've been feeling
the exact same way.

18:29.425 --> 18:30.924
-You have?
-I have to be honest.

18:30.944 --> 18:34.003
I did kind of want to get Steven
back, and I'm sorry for that.

18:34.005 --> 18:36.981
I was jealous of you a little,
I guess, and... (chuckles)

18:37.133 --> 18:38.783
Because I think
you're beautiful and talented.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.434
I mean, you're amazing
at volleyball,

18:40.528 --> 18:42.178
and everyone
in school knows that.

18:42.271 --> 18:43.621
I am amazing at volleyball.

18:43.848 --> 18:46.182
And then I didn't get the part
I wanted, you got that part.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.625
I had to play
an inanimate object,

18:47.776 --> 18:49.293
and then my dad got a line,

18:49.445 --> 18:50.944
and then I had to sing
your part from the pit,

18:51.038 --> 18:52.296
without getting any credit.

18:52.523 --> 18:55.449
(sighs) It was just a lot
of bad stuff all at once.

18:55.543 --> 18:58.027
Yeah, I guess I didn't see it
from your point of view.

18:58.045 --> 18:59.137
Ms. McNamara told me

18:59.364 --> 19:00.787
she just wanted to give me
a chance to shine,

19:00.807 --> 19:03.975
but I don't shine at singing,
I shine at volleyball.

19:04.126 --> 19:05.050
You really do.

19:05.203 --> 19:06.535
She also said she was doing this

19:06.704 --> 19:08.295
because she thinks
you talk too much,

19:08.389 --> 19:09.889
and you're always trying
to get attention,

19:10.041 --> 19:12.041
and that is why
she put you in the pit.

19:12.059 --> 19:13.317
-What?
-Don't worry,

19:13.469 --> 19:16.045
I don't think that stuff
about you. Ms. McNamara...

19:16.063 --> 19:18.731
-BOTH: Sucks!
-(laughs) She really does.

19:18.883 --> 19:21.325
I do like the attention I get
when I'm in musicals,

19:21.477 --> 19:23.327
but not because
I love attention or something.

19:23.479 --> 19:24.811
It's because
I'm good at musicals.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.481
I know. It's good to shine
at things you shine at.

19:27.558 --> 19:29.909
She also said you're
constantly pulling focus,

19:30.003 --> 19:31.560
you're a try-hard,

19:31.579 --> 19:33.412
and that you're not as whimsical
as you think you are.

19:33.564 --> 19:35.673
Wow, there is something
very wrong with her.

19:35.900 --> 19:39.402
-Mm-hmm.
-But you may have actually
taught me a good lesson.

19:39.495 --> 19:40.845
Next time I see
another girl struggling,

19:41.072 --> 19:42.180
I should try to help them

19:42.331 --> 19:44.164
instead of just
thinking about myself.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.349
I should've supported you,

19:45.518 --> 19:47.426
like those guys
on the<i> Barbara Gail,</i>

19:47.520 --> 19:50.095

-(slow clapping)

19:50.932 --> 19:53.006
The best drama
really is backstage.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.860
