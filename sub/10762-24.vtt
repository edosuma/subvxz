WEBVTT

00:08.541 --> 00:10.443
Kenny, this is
not amateur hour.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.812
My show is already suffering
enough just losing Roz

00:12.812 --> 00:14.814
I will not let you replace
her with a complete novice

00:14.814 --> 00:16.983
Come on,
don't you remember

00:17.484 --> 00:18.985
when you were
a young whippersnapper

00:18.985 --> 00:20.453
with nothing but
a pantload of talent

00:20.453 --> 00:21.488
and a head full of dreams?

00:23.490 --> 00:25.959
Are we still
talking about Noel?

00:26.326 --> 00:29.763
Five seconds to
launch, Dr. Crane.

00:30.096 --> 00:31.097
Yeah.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.336
Good afternoon, Seattle.
This is Dr. Frasier Crane.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.772
Before we get to our first call,
I'd like to remind you

00:38.772 --> 00:42.275
that we are losing
our beloved producer, Roz Doyle,

00:42.275 --> 00:44.677
in a couple of weeks
to another career opportunity.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.579
That's KPXY, The Mighty Pixy
.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.581
Seattle's more exciting talk.
Whoo-hoo!

00:52.118 --> 00:55.688
In the meantime, we have
with us today Noel Shempsky,

00:56.189 --> 00:59.192
a KACL employee whose
sole qualification for this job

00:59.192 --> 01:03.029
seems to be that
he's never taken a sick day.

01:03.296 --> 01:07.667
Good afternoon, listeners near
and stars away.

01:07.667 --> 01:12.472
Our first query comes from a Class M planet we call Earth

01:12.472 --> 01:15.475
and appears to be
personal in nature.

01:15.975 --> 01:19.245
Oh, and his name is Glen.

01:22.015 --> 01:23.850
Go ahead, Glen, I'm listening.

01:24.117 --> 01:25.185
Okay, Noel, that was good.

01:25.685 --> 01:28.655
But you need to tell Frasier
the name of the caller,

01:28.655 --> 01:31.624
the town they're calling from and why they're calling.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.525
Okay.

01:32.525 --> 01:34.461
You know, maybe
I would learn more

01:34.461 --> 01:37.464
if you sat down behind me
and guided my hands,

01:37.464 --> 01:39.466
like they did in Ghost.

01:39.466 --> 01:41.434
Oh! Noel!

01:42.969 --> 01:44.270
Oh, hi, Julia.

01:44.504 --> 01:45.505
Do you mind?

01:45.505 --> 01:47.407
I'm trying to
show Noel what I do.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.276
Is that why he's on his knees?

01:52.679 --> 01:54.147
Get up.

01:54.147 --> 01:57.650
Let me give you
some pointers on
call screening.

01:57.650 --> 02:00.587
Your first priority are your leapers and jumpers.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.522
Next up, angry people.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.524
They're great energy
and a welcome change

02:04.524 --> 02:07.026
from our largest group,
the sad sacks.

02:07.026 --> 02:09.529
The trick of it is you want
to arrange all of these calls

02:10.029 --> 02:12.031
so that each segment
is "can't miss" radio.

02:12.532 --> 02:13.500
But I thought
it was just about

02:13.500 --> 02:15.768
Frasier doing good work.

02:15.768 --> 02:17.537
Please!
It's all about ratings.

02:18.037 --> 02:19.539
If the station had its way,

02:19.539 --> 02:23.309
every call would end
in an auto-erotic suicide.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.577
Thank you, Roz.

02:24.577 --> 02:27.080
Now that Seattle knows
how we do things around here,

02:27.080 --> 02:29.082
perhaps you could
let Noel know

02:29.582 --> 02:32.085
to keep his elbow
off the mic button.

02:39.659 --> 02:40.927
we'll do paper
work together?

02:41.127 --> 02:42.629
(flat):
Yeah, it's really sad.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.799
What exactly is
the new job, Roz?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.535
Program director.

02:48.801 --> 02:50.870
Now that's a job.

02:50.870 --> 02:53.706
Let me give you
a little piece of advice.

02:53.706 --> 02:57.477
Less smut and
more older-people shows.

02:57.477 --> 02:58.878
Yeah, I know, Martin,

02:58.878 --> 02:59.812
but that's not exactly
what they're going for.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.247
Well, why not?

03:01.247 --> 03:03.716
You could have a show
about owning dogs.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.185
Or how about this?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.687
A show where people just call in
with jokes they've heard

03:07.687 --> 03:09.088
That'd be a riot.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.024
I think they're looking for a wider audience

03:11.024 --> 03:12.992
than just you, Dad.

03:12.992 --> 03:14.460
Lots of people
would be interested

03:14.460 --> 03:15.929
in that sort of thing.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.765
Yeah, but the advertisers are
looking for the young dollars.

03:18.765 --> 03:19.966
What's wrong with my money?

03:19.966 --> 03:21.801
You don't spend it all
on fast food and beer.

03:21.801 --> 03:24.170
Yes, I do.

03:24.170 --> 03:27.640
You know, I'â€™m tired
of society blowing me off

03:27.640 --> 03:29.042
just because
I'm a senior citizen.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.910
You know,
one day we're gonna rise

03:30.910 --> 03:33.446
and take this country back
from you young smart alecks.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.915
And it won't be pretty either.

03:35.915 --> 03:38.751
I could mention
the joke idea to my boss.

03:38.751 --> 03:41.421
You just bought yourself
a little more time.

03:43.790 --> 03:44.791
Well, here it is, Roz,

03:45.291 --> 03:48.127
the final parking requisition form.

03:48.127 --> 03:50.430
The end of an era.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.433
Listen, I know that Kenny is giving you a going away party

03:53.433 --> 03:55.935
but I wanted to have a
little celebratory dinner,

03:56.436 --> 03:57.437
just the two of us, all right?

03:57.437 --> 03:58.905
Any night you're free.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.440
Well, Niles and Daphne
are watching Alice.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.441
How about tonight?

04:01.941 --> 04:04.377
Well, actually,
I'm meeting Julia later.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.080
Why would you
want to do that?

04:07.280 --> 04:11.618
Well, we've sort of been
seeing each other lately.

04:11.884 --> 04:13.453
You and Julia?

04:13.453 --> 04:15.888
She's a total bitch.

04:16.289 --> 04:19.325
Now, Roz, if you took the time
to get to know her,

04:19.325 --> 04:21.361
you'd see that she's
really not such a bad person.

04:21.793 --> 04:24.197
Like get to know her naked,
you mean.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.499
No.

04:26.899 --> 04:28.901
I think she's
been misjudged.

04:29.235 --> 04:30.303
Sure, she has a lot of walls up,

04:30.803 --> 04:32.805
but, I mean, there must be
something good inside

04:32.805 --> 04:34.240
if it needs
that much protection.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.175
Yeah, well, there are walls
around prisons, too.

04:36.175 --> 04:37.143
Yes. Fine.

04:37.577 --> 04:39.646
Your opinion
has been noted.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.148
There are walls
around insane asylums, cholera wards...

04:42.148 --> 04:44.651
Thank you, Roz.
nuclear facilities,
gator farms...

04:44.651 --> 04:46.152
All right, shut up.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.656
Got you!

04:49.656 --> 04:50.990
Oh.

04:51.257 --> 04:52.158
Now you chase me.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.661
(anguished laughter):
Oh...

04:54.661 --> 04:55.962
No, I think
it's Daphne's turn.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.798
Oh, no, I just had
four turns in a row.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.266
But you know who does
want a turn?

05:00.266 --> 05:02.735
The TV.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.738
There you go.
Your video's all cued up

05:07.240 --> 05:08.741
(sighs)

05:08.741 --> 05:09.676
Should we really be
plopping her

05:10.176 --> 05:11.044
in front of the tube?

05:11.044 --> 05:12.345
It's an educational tape

05:12.345 --> 05:16.282
Did you want to read her
more Jung for Jungsters?

05:16.282 --> 05:18.251
She doesn't seem
to respond to it.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.687
Perhaps that's a treat
we'll save for our own child

05:20.687 --> 05:21.754
When will that be?

05:21.754 --> 05:23.690
When are we going to have
a child of our own?

05:23.690 --> 05:25.658
Oh, I don't know,
when we're ready.

05:25.664 --> 05:26.726
Yes, we always say that,

05:27.226 --> 05:28.728
but how will we know
Yes, when we're ready?

05:28.728 --> 05:30.730
I mean, if it were just me,
I'm ready right now.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.131
Really?

05:32.498 --> 05:35.468
I just don't feel like
we're quite there yet.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.836
What has to change?

05:39.038 --> 05:41.541
What's this little brat
doing here?

05:41.541 --> 05:45.011
Make sure it don't
make any noise.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.013
I'm resting.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.516
Maybe it's
my biorhythms.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.518
Daphne, might it have
something to do with

05:52.518 --> 05:55.288
your mother
living with us?
(toy squeaks)

05:55.488 --> 05:57.557
Well, I've always thought in the back of my head

05:58.057 --> 05:59.892
that we'd start a
family after she left.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.260
Well, but that doesn't
have to stop us

06:01.761 --> 06:02.762
from getting pregnant.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.263
And once we are,
we've got nine months

06:04.263 --> 06:05.231
to get her out of the house.

06:05.765 --> 06:06.666
Are you kidding?

06:06.999 --> 06:08.568
If she found out there was a grandchild on the way,

06:09.068 --> 06:10.069
she'd never leave.

06:10.069 --> 06:11.571
And I don't
think I could take Mum

06:11.571 --> 06:13.573
and morning sickness
at the same time.

06:13.573 --> 06:16.209
Well, on the other hand,

06:16.209 --> 06:19.078
a grandmother can be
a wonderful influence
on a child.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.314
Alice...

06:21.681 --> 06:24.250
you help Auntie Gert
find her cigarettes,

06:24.250 --> 06:26.552
and you can have one.

06:34.293 --> 06:35.795
(clinking glass)

06:36.295 --> 06:38.765
I think now would be a good time
if anyone wants to stand up,

06:38.765 --> 06:40.800
say a few words to Roz.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.235
I know I'll miss her.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.570
Which is why I'm proud to present her with...

06:44.904 --> 06:48.975
this picture of the two of us
at the last company picnic.

06:49.475 --> 06:50.977
Won't that baby look nice in a frame?

06:50.977 --> 06:52.979
Yeah.
Enjoy.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.916
I'm next.

07:01.921 --> 07:05.825
"Sweetest Roz, you are my ship
when I'm at sea,

07:05.825 --> 07:08.728
"my fairest rose, my fantasy.

07:08.728 --> 07:11.130
"With each sunrise, my thanks I send

07:11.130 --> 07:14.434
for you, my love,
my true best friend."

07:14.434 --> 07:16.035
Aw, that's...

07:16.035 --> 07:17.804
Puke!

07:18.304 --> 07:20.273
That was beautiful, you son of a b.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.307
Okay, every...

07:21.307 --> 07:22.308
Sit down.

07:22.308 --> 07:23.810
Sit down, Noel.
Sit down.

07:23.810 --> 07:25.311
Okay, everybody,
Bulldog to the rescue.

07:25.311 --> 07:27.313
Now...

07:27.313 --> 07:30.316
I don't want to say Roz
has had a lot of sex,

07:30.316 --> 07:33.152
but she's spent more time
on her back than King Tut.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.325
Did you hear the story
about the guy at KACL

07:39.826 --> 07:41.327
who didn'thave sex with Roz?

07:41.327 --> 07:43.329
Me neither.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.331
But, uh, seriously--

07:45.331 --> 07:48.134
What's the difference between Roz and a dog in heat?

07:49.402 --> 07:51.871
No, really, I'm asking.

07:51.871 --> 07:53.773
You people suck!

07:53.773 --> 07:56.642
It's not a roast, Bulldog.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.010
It's not?

07:58.010 --> 07:59.579
I paid a guy
at the Chuckle Factory

08:00.012 --> 08:01.481
50 bucks to write jokes for me.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.716
When's he getting here?

08:03.716 --> 08:06.886
Okay, okay...
you want a speech?

08:06.886 --> 08:08.754
Best of luck
in your new job, Roz.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.656
If you're ever
need a sports guy,

08:10.656 --> 08:12.024
I'm your man.

08:12.024 --> 08:15.094
And I wouldn't have any problem with you being my boss.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.029
After all,
I know what it feels like

08:17.029 --> 08:19.098
to be underneath you,
am I right?

08:20.099 --> 08:23.803
Watch what you say about her!

08:23.803 --> 08:25.280
FRASIER:
Noel, Bulldog, come on!

08:25.280 --> 08:27.373
Walk it off, Noel.
Walk it off. Go on.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.043
Careful, gents

08:31.043 --> 08:33.011
Really, the way you two
are always carrying on,

08:33.011 --> 08:35.047
people are going
to start talking.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.049
Hello, all.

08:38.049 --> 08:42.054
Gil Chesterton here,
with a toast to Roz Doyle.

08:42.554 --> 08:43.556
Hear, hear.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.892
A wonderful co-worker
and a good friend.

08:45.892 --> 08:47.760
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.195
Of course, I, too,

08:49.529 --> 08:52.098
noticed Roz's sex appeal immediately

08:52.098 --> 08:57.403
She had the same effect on all of us stallions
in the KACL corral.

08:57.403 --> 09:03.476
She made us want to paw the ground

09:03.976 --> 09:05.978
fetlocks glistening.

09:06.479 --> 09:10.483
Smokey, Misty,
Storm! Away!

09:15.788 --> 09:17.590
Okay, bar's closed.

09:17.590 --> 09:18.925
Gil?... (whistles)

09:20.259 --> 09:22.094
Uh, Julia, your turn.

09:22.094 --> 09:23.596
Oh. Uh...

09:23.596 --> 09:27.099
Well, I've only
known Roz a short time,

09:27.099 --> 09:30.603
but I can see that
she's a valuable
member of this team.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.505
And I'm sure
you'll be missed.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.440
Good luck.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.443
Well said, well said.
Uh...

09:37.443 --> 09:39.445
(clears throat)

09:39.445 --> 09:40.813
Roz...

09:40.813 --> 09:44.050
I celebrate your new
adventure with you.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.352
But I wouldn't be honest
if I didn't say

09:46.352 --> 09:48.854
that this is a big loss for me.

09:48.854 --> 09:52.358
You were there
on my very first day at KACL

09:52.358 --> 09:54.226
and you took me under your wing.

09:54.226 --> 09:57.630
It's crowded under there

09:57.630 --> 10:01.133
(whispers):
I will kill you.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.108
I don't think
I'll ever grow accustomed

10:09.108 --> 10:11.877
to seeing somebody else
in your booth.

10:11.877 --> 10:13.646
And certainly no one else
can ever take your place

10:13.646 --> 10:15.615
in our hearts.

10:15.615 --> 10:20.386
And while we welcome
new friends,

10:20.386 --> 10:26.158
we are sad to say
good-bye to old ones.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.059
Good luck, Roz

10:27.059 --> 10:28.461
Hear, hear

10:28.461 --> 10:30.463
Speech.
Come on, Roz.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.731
Speech, speech!

10:33.399 --> 10:35.801
(clears throat)

10:36.302 --> 10:37.570
Thanks, you guys.

10:39.171 --> 10:42.508
I just love you all
for doing this for me.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.977
We really are like a family,
aren't we?

10:44.977 --> 10:48.481
You know, this job at KPXY

10:48.481 --> 10:51.250
is a really great,
great opportunity,

10:51.250 --> 10:55.021
but it'll never be like this

10:55.021 --> 10:57.523
Which is why
I'm changing my mind.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.525
I can't leave KACL.
I'm staying.

10:59.525 --> 11:01.861
Really?!

11:01.861 --> 11:04.196
(cheering)

11:06.000 --> 11:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:16.409 --> 11:19.211
uh, we'd like to get two double lattes to go, please.

11:19.445 --> 11:22.415
For an extra dollar,
I can add a nip of brandy.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.084
Is that on the menu?

11:25.084 --> 11:28.187
It's on the secret menu.

11:28.187 --> 11:30.823
I'll pass, thank you.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.627
You know, Frasier,
I feel so invigorated

11:34.627 --> 11:36.128
to get back
to my old job.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.129
Oh, Roz...

11:37.129 --> 11:38.130
In fact, I'd really like to record

11:38.130 --> 11:39.565
some promos tonight,
if you're available.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.033
Oh, I can't.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.535
I'm taking Julia
to the movies.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.804
One of my favorites:
Noch Einen Stuhl.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.539
Noch Einen Stuhl?

11:46.939 --> 11:49.508
Yes. It's the story
of a 19th-century
Austrian family

11:49.508 --> 11:53.012
as told from the point of view
of an old fireside armchair.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.348
I'm sorry, I dozed off.

11:56.348 --> 11:57.683
What were you saying?

11:57.983 --> 12:00.019
I've got to get
an alternative newspaper

12:00.019 --> 12:01.020
to check show times.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.021
I'll be right back.

12:02.421 --> 12:03.489
Here we are.

12:03.489 --> 12:04.990
Oh...

12:04.990 --> 12:07.493
(phone ringing)

12:07.493 --> 12:08.994
Your phone's ringing.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.496
Oh, it's not mine, it's Frasier's.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.298
(ringing continues)

12:12.531 --> 12:14.600
Ew! It's Julia.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.135
Who's that?

12:16.135 --> 12:18.204
Oh, this witch who'â€™s trying to get her
hooks into Frasier.

12:18.204 --> 12:20.206
I hate her.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.208
I'll fix her.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.110
Wh-Wh-What
are you doing?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.545
(sultry):
â™ªâ™ª Hello. â™ªâ™ª

12:26.545 --> 12:28.047
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.049
Frasier's in no position
to talk,

12:30.049 --> 12:31.817
if you, uh, get my meaning.

12:32.017 --> 12:34.553
Who is this, then?

12:34.954 --> 12:37.022
Hold on.

12:37.022 --> 12:40.526
Sweetheart, do you want to talk
to a Julia?

12:40.526 --> 12:43.395
(giggling):
Oh, Frasier, put me down.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.265
(both snickering)

12:46.766 --> 12:50.269
Sorry, he's not here
after all. Bye, now.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.072
There.
Problem solved.

12:53.405 --> 12:55.474
You know, you probably ruined
their entire evening.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.843
How can I thank you?

12:57.843 --> 13:00.746
Only one showing of
Noch Einen Stuhltonight.

13:00.746 --> 13:01.247
Got to
 go by the box office

13:01.747 --> 13:02.748
and pick up
the tickets.

13:02.748 --> 13:05.251
Yes, I bet
they're going fast.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.252
Hello!
Oh, sorry!

13:06.252 --> 13:07.753
Wish we could join you guys.

13:07.753 --> 13:09.755
I'm going to get tickets for Noch Einen Stuhl!

13:09.755 --> 13:11.757
Cutting it a little close,
aren't you?

13:13.759 --> 13:15.261
Hey, Mum.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.263
When you've finished your shift, we'll drive you home.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.031
Really?

13:19.031 --> 13:20.766
Are you sure it wouldn't
give you more pleasure

13:20.766 --> 13:24.136
to see me walk home
on my bloody stumps?

13:24.136 --> 13:26.405
Well, it would,
but we're in a hurry.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.407
We'll be here
when you're ready.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.443
Oh, Niles...

13:31.443 --> 13:32.945
Oh...

13:32.945 --> 13:34.947
Just think, one day,
we'll have one of those.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.449
Yes. Just
one awkward chore

13:37.449 --> 13:38.851
to get out of the way.

13:38.851 --> 13:42.555
Well, that's romantic.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.657
I meant asking your mother
to move out.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.991
We're not
asking her, Niles.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.493
We're telling her.
I know. I know.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.994
You have to be firm.
Yes.

13:48.994 --> 13:49.995
This is a woman
who came for week

13:49.995 --> 13:50.996
and stayed for
a year and a half.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.498
Yes, I know.
I just think that...

13:52.498 --> 13:53.499
It's not like she's
got no place to go.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.500
She's got seven
other children!

13:55.000 --> 13:55.501
I know

13:56.001 --> 13:57.002
Plus, a home
and friends in England.

13:57.503 --> 13:58.003
Many friends, yes.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.438
I just... I...

13:59.805 --> 14:01.774
I just don't know
how to break it to her.

14:02.074 --> 14:03.142
Well, the sooner we do,

14:03.142 --> 14:05.411
the sooner can start
our own family.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.179
You're right.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.682
Do you realize,
this time next year,

14:09.682 --> 14:12.484
we could be sitting here
with our own baby?

14:12.718 --> 14:15.287
Baby?

14:15.287 --> 14:16.789
What's this, then?

14:16.789 --> 14:18.224
We'll talk about it later.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.593
I want to talk about it now.
What's going on?

14:20.960 --> 14:22.528
Well, I was going
to wait until later,

14:22.528 --> 14:24.029
but if you really
want to know, we...

14:24.530 --> 14:26.332
Wait, wait,
Daphne, Daphne
... (clears throat)

14:29.301 --> 14:31.270
Oh, well,
I'm glad you

14:33.138 --> 14:34.206
I was beginning to think

14:34.707 --> 14:36.175
there might be something wrong
with your equipment, Niles.

14:36.575 --> 14:38.077
Oh, were you?

14:38.444 --> 14:40.512
Well, here's more news:
You're out of the house,

14:40.512 --> 14:42.014
so pack your bags
and find another sucker.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.017
Uh, excuse me,

14:45.451 --> 14:47.019
could I get
some service over here?

14:47.019 --> 14:48.520
Keep your knickers on.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.022
Don't move.

14:50.022 --> 14:51.857
We're not done
hashing this through.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.662
â™ªâ™ª Hello. â™ªâ™ª

14:56.662 --> 14:59.598
(suspiciously)
: Hello.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.737
â™ªâ™ª Hello. â™ªâ™ª

15:06.839 --> 15:08.641
Say that again.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.744
â™ªâ™ª Hello? â™ªâ™ª

15:11.744 --> 15:15.581
Now say, "Frasier's in no position to talk,

15:15.581 --> 15:17.483
if you get my meaning."

15:17.483 --> 15:21.253
Now, it was all Roz's idea

15:21.253 --> 15:23.489
I had no choice.

15:23.489 --> 15:25.724
I'm not a well woman.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.234
Hello, Roz.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.201
Julia.

15:36.201 --> 15:37.202
(shuts door)

15:37.703 --> 15:39.705
I just talked to that waitress
over at Nervosa.

15:39.705 --> 15:41.473
The one that answered
Frasier's phone.

15:41.473 --> 15:43.175
She gave you up immediately.

15:43.175 --> 15:44.076
(laughing):
Relax.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.011
It was just a joke.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.980
Okay.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.481
So, what's going on?

15:49.481 --> 15:51.951
Do you have some sort of problem
with me seeing Frasier?

15:52.384 --> 15:54.853
Well, as long as
you're asking...

15:55.187 --> 15:57.589
I think you're all wrong
for him.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.358
That's not your call.

15:59.692 --> 16:03.095
I think I know Frasier
a little better than you.

16:12.571 --> 16:14.573
So?

16:14.573 --> 16:16.075
So...

16:16.575 --> 16:18.077
he deserves
someone better.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.945
Someone who'll
appreciate him.

16:20.279 --> 16:20.846
Oh, really?

16:21.347 --> 16:22.147
Yeah.

16:22.414 --> 16:23.482
Frasier's a good guy.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.451
He's smart and sweet
and way too good for you.

16:25.985 --> 16:26.952
Why don't you just leave

16:26.952 --> 16:28.420
Nobody here
likes you, anyway.

16:28.754 --> 16:30.689
Frasier seems to.

16:30.956 --> 16:32.024
Well, he's an idiot.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.795
Are you trying to save Frasier
from me

16:36.795 --> 16:38.697
or are you trying to save him
for yourself?

16:39.064 --> 16:40.933
Are you out of your mind?

16:41.233 --> 16:42.301
You in love with him?

16:42.301 --> 16:43.802
Go to hell, Julia.

16:43.802 --> 16:45.804
That would explain why you
turned down that great job

16:45.804 --> 16:47.306
That is not true.

16:47.306 --> 16:48.807
Then stay out of my way.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.809
Or what?

16:50.809 --> 16:51.710
Do you want
to find out?

16:51.710 --> 16:53.412
What, are you going
to hit me or something?

16:53.412 --> 16:54.680
Don't think I won't.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.648
Well, you're sure
taking your time.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.723
Stay away from him.

17:04.723 --> 17:06.191
Got it?

17:09.294 --> 17:10.796
Get out of here!

17:16.300 --> 17:18.303
Well, I guess
this is good-bye.

17:18.303 --> 17:20.305
Um, I just
want you to know,

17:20.305 --> 17:22.273
I love you both
very much,

17:22.273 --> 17:23.675
and I'm, you know,
looking forward

17:24.209 --> 17:25.611
to standing
on my own two feet again.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.012
Uh...

17:27.012 --> 17:30.516
Thank you for the ticket,
and the luggage

17:30.516 --> 17:33.018
and the clothes
and the spending money.

17:33.018 --> 17:34.019
(gasping)

17:34.019 --> 17:36.955
I'm sorry.
This is just so sad.

17:36.955 --> 17:38.857
Gertrude, are you sure you're okay--

17:38.857 --> 17:40.859
Good-bye, Mum.
Have a nice trip.

17:40.859 --> 17:42.828
Say hello to everyone
in Manchester for me.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.830
Right, then.

17:46.832 --> 17:47.833
Good-bye, Niles.

17:48.333 --> 17:49.334
Good-bye.

17:50.836 --> 17:52.337
I know you'll be
a wonderful father

17:52.838 --> 17:54.807
to my grandchild.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.644
I hope you'â€™ll find time
to send me a picture.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.012
Well, can't we
all just talk...

18:00.512 --> 18:02.014
We have your address.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.219
I'm off.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.120
Bye.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.623
(sighs)

18:11.623 --> 18:13.125
Oh, Daphne, you were wonderful

18:13.125 --> 18:14.626
I don't know
how you did it

18:14.626 --> 18:16.628
(sobbing)

18:17.129 --> 18:18.564
Hold me, Niles.

18:18.564 --> 18:20.099
(sobbing)

18:20.099 --> 18:23.836
Hang on. Hang on.

18:24.036 --> 18:25.070
Gertrude!

18:25.070 --> 18:26.105
(sobbing):
Yes?

18:28.373 --> 18:29.741
Come here, come here.

18:29.975 --> 18:31.743
Uh...

18:32.010 --> 18:34.079
Would you be willing
to stay in Seattle

18:34.079 --> 18:36.415
if-if, say, you had
your own apartment?

18:36.415 --> 18:37.749
Oh, Niles...

18:38.150 --> 18:39.218
Do you really mean that?

18:39.218 --> 18:40.185
I mean, I don't want
to intrude.

18:40.586 --> 18:41.653
Well, of course I mean it.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.956
And-And-And we'd
even help with the rent.

18:44.223 --> 18:46.291
Define "help."

18:46.291 --> 18:48.093
We'll talk.

18:48.093 --> 18:49.428
Well, then, it's settled

18:49.428 --> 18:50.929
I'll just go tell the taxi I'm not going.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.431
No, no, no, you're going

18:52.431 --> 18:54.933
Just tell them to take you
to the Four Seasons.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.369
I'll go ahead and call
and book you a room.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.272
You've made me so happy,
I think I'm going to cry.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.140
Oh, come here...
(Niles laughing)

19:03.909 --> 19:05.911
Niles, I...

19:05.911 --> 19:07.913
I don't know
how to thank you.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.420
I do.

19:19.424 --> 19:20.425
Hey, Martin.

19:20.425 --> 19:21.426
Hi, Roz.
Come in.

19:21.426 --> 19:22.427
Is Frasier here?

19:22.427 --> 19:23.428
I really need
to talk to him

19:23.929 --> 19:25.430
No, he went out
for dinner.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.432
Oh, let me guess: Julia.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.935
Wow. Not a fan, huh?

19:29.935 --> 19:31.436
I can't stand her,
actually.

19:31.436 --> 19:32.437
(chuckling):
Really!

19:32.938 --> 19:33.939
Well, I just met her
this evening,

19:33.939 --> 19:35.440
but she seemed nice to me.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.309
Well, that's because
she's got you snowed.

19:37.309 --> 19:38.844
She's a mean, snooty tight-ass

19:38.844 --> 19:40.846
who thinks she's better
than everybody else,

19:40.846 --> 19:42.347
and Frasier's making
a giant mistake,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.650
and somebody's got to do
something about it.

19:44.650 --> 19:45.984
Well, good luck.

19:45.984 --> 19:48.353
When Frasier's heart takes over, his brain shuts down.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.689
That's why we have to do
something now,

19:50.689 --> 19:53.525
before this relationship
gets any closer.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.827
Will you help me?

19:55.827 --> 19:57.829
Well, Roz, if you feel
that strongly about it

19:57.829 --> 19:59.331
sure, I'll back you up.

19:59.331 --> 20:00.766
(door opening)

20:00.766 --> 20:02.167
Oh, hi, guys.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.168
MARTIN: Hi.
Hi

20:03.168 --> 20:04.236
Hi, Roz.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.671
Hello, Roz.
Nice to see you.

20:06.171 --> 20:06.672
Julia.

20:07.172 --> 20:07.706
Martin, I've brought you

20:08.173 --> 20:10.742
some cake from the restaurant.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.244
Restaurant cake!

20:14.746 --> 20:16.114
Steady...

20:16.114 --> 20:17.449
It's chocolate-- why don't I

20:17.449 --> 20:18.917
cut you a slice
and pour you some milk.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.689
New plan.

20:23.689 --> 20:26.091
I'll distract her
while you talk to Frasier.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.361
What's going on, Roz?

20:29.861 --> 20:30.862
I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

20:30.862 --> 20:31.863
Well, um,
I have something

20:32.364 --> 20:33.865
really important
to talk to you about,

20:33.865 --> 20:35.367
and I really need you
to listen to me.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.301
Well, absolutely.

20:36.301 --> 20:39.037
That's what I do.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.872
I really, really,
really think

20:40.872 --> 20:42.874
you should
stop seeing Julia.

20:44.376 --> 20:46.878
Look, I know you two
have your difficulties

20:46.878 --> 20:47.879
No, it's not that.

20:48.380 --> 20:49.881
She's all wrong for you.

20:51.883 --> 20:53.385
I think I see what's going on here.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.387
You and I have a
close relationship

20:55.387 --> 20:57.389
A new woman comes
to the radio station,

20:57.389 --> 20:58.890
she and I form a
close relationship

20:59.391 --> 21:01.226
and you feel threatened.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.862
No. She's evil.

21:03.862 --> 21:06.431
It's not your fault.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.067
You can't see it because
she puts on an act around you.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.435
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe

21:10.435 --> 21:11.436
she's putting on an act
for everybody else,

21:11.436 --> 21:12.804
and maybe I see her
as she really is?

21:12.804 --> 21:15.540
Oh, she's got you
totally brainwashed!

21:15.540 --> 21:17.376
Roz, you have no right
to come over here

21:17.376 --> 21:18.377
and run her down to me.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.178
It's really
none of your business.

21:20.178 --> 21:21.346
This is my business.

21:21.346 --> 21:22.180
And why?

21:22.180 --> 21:24.082
Because...

21:24.082 --> 21:26.585
we're friends.

21:27.085 --> 21:29.588
I can't believe you're turning on me like this!

21:29.588 --> 21:32.090
I gave up a job
that was ten times better

21:32.090 --> 21:33.592
to stay on your show!

21:33.592 --> 21:34.860
Yes, and frankly, I
don't understand that!

21:34.860 --> 21:37.129
Why, exactly,
did you turn down that job?

21:37.129 --> 21:39.064
Out of loyalty to you!

21:39.064 --> 21:40.065
Loyalty to me! Are you sure?

21:40.065 --> 21:41.566
Are you sure it wasn't just fear?

21:41.566 --> 21:44.069
Are you sure you're not just using me as an excuse

21:44.069 --> 21:45.003
not to grow and move on?

21:45.003 --> 21:46.772
Who wants restaurant cake?

21:49.107 --> 21:52.077
You're going to have
to choose, Frasier.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.012
You will not put me
in this position, Roz.

21:54.012 --> 21:55.013
We will discuss it later.

21:55.013 --> 21:57.516
No! Tell me!

21:57.516 --> 21:59.318
It's her or me!

21:59.318 --> 22:01.520
Tell me now,
or I swear to God,

22:01.520 --> 22:04.022
I will walk out of here
and I will not come back!

22:09.695 --> 22:10.696
Thank you, Julia.

22:10.696 --> 22:12.597
I think I will have some cake.

22:18.403 --> 22:19.271
(weakly):
Fine.

22:25.077 --> 22:26.144
(door closes)

22:30.615 --> 22:33.151
And this will be
your office, Ms. Doyle

22:33.151 --> 22:34.152
Make yourself at home.

22:34.653 --> 22:36.621
Thank you, Mr. Wiswell

22:36.621 --> 22:39.124
Uh, there's no chance

22:39.558 --> 22:40.592
you'll change your mind again, is there?

22:40.992 --> 22:43.962
No. KACL is ancient history.

22:44.262 --> 22:45.831
Good.

22:54.005 --> 22:55.507
â™ªâ™ª Hey, baby,
I hear the blues a-callin'â€™â€™
 â™ªâ™ª

22:56.007 --> 22:58.510
â™ªâ™ª Tossed salads
and scrambled eggs â™ª
â™ª

22:59.010 --> 23:00.512
Mercy!

23:00.946 --> 23:03.014
â™ªâ™ª And maybe I seem
a bit confused â™ªâ™ª

23:03.014 --> 23:05.517
â™ªâ™ª Well, maybe, but
I got you pegged! â™ªâ™ª

23:05.517 --> 23:08.019
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha
!

23:08.019 --> 23:09.521
â™ªâ™ª But I don'â€™â€™t k
now what to do â™ªâ™ª

23:09.521 --> 23:11.022
â™ªâ™ª With those tossed salads â™ªâ™ª

23:11.022 --> 23:13.525
â™ªâ™ª And scrambled eggs â™ªâ™ª

23:14.025 --> 23:15.026
â™ªâ™ª They're callin' again â™ªâ™ª

23:16.528 --> 23:18.029
Good night!
