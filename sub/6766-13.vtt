WEBVTT

00:01.734 --> 00:03.703
Hold on tight.

00:06.939 --> 00:09.841
Spin me again!
Spin me again!

00:09.876 --> 00:10.934
No, that's enough spinning.

00:10.977 --> 00:12.501
Come down here
and order your dinner.

00:12.545 --> 00:14.137
Aw, Mom, do we have to?

00:14.180 --> 00:15.147
Yes.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.341
All right.

00:16.383 --> 00:18.078
What'll it be, sport?

00:18.118 --> 00:21.349
An ice cream sundae
or a piece of chocolate cake?

00:21.388 --> 00:22.480
Oh, you're a good influence.

00:22.522 --> 00:23.784
Okay, fine,

00:23.823 --> 00:25.620
we'll have our hot dogs first,
then dessert.

00:25.658 --> 00:26.647
Can you handle that?

00:26.693 --> 00:27.853
You do not

00:27.894 --> 00:30.362
want her on a sugar rush
for the next 48 hours.

00:30.397 --> 00:31.796
We promise to be good.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.560
Tell her we promise to be good.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.227
We promise we'll be good.

00:35.268 --> 00:36.394
All right.

00:36.436 --> 00:39.701
I feel so bad just pawning her
off on you.

00:39.739 --> 00:40.706
You don't have anything
to worry about.

00:40.740 --> 00:41.866
Just go stand by your friend

00:41.908 --> 00:44.206
in court, and when Mel
and Jackie get back

00:44.244 --> 00:45.643
from their getaway weekend,

00:45.678 --> 00:47.407
their little princess will be
just like they left her, right?

00:48.415 --> 00:51.009
Maybe I shouldn't go to court.

00:51.117 --> 00:52.778
I should be watching Erin.

00:52.819 --> 00:54.548
She'll be fine with Colin,
David.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.020
Hey, guys.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.216
- Hey.
- Hey, pull up a chair.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.692
No can do.
We're just getting some takeout.

01:00.727 --> 01:03.093
For a romantic evening
at the office.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.492
Hey, Nat.

01:05.532 --> 01:06.624
Hey, what'll it be?

01:06.666 --> 01:08.600
- The usual.
- The usual, ah, a veggie burger,

01:08.635 --> 01:10.193
hold the avocado,

01:10.236 --> 01:11.828
and a Mega Royale,

01:11.871 --> 01:13.498
heavy on the onions.

01:13.540 --> 01:14.598
That'll do it.

01:14.641 --> 01:15.699
Onions?

01:16.743 --> 01:19.405
Hold the onions.

01:25.985 --> 01:27.179
Well, it looks like

01:27.220 --> 01:28.653
Brandon and Susan are for real.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.558
Well, togetherness isn't about
whether or not you eat onions.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.390
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know the saying:

01:35.428 --> 01:38.124
while the cat's away,
the mice will cheat?

01:38.164 --> 01:39.358
Yeah. So?

01:39.399 --> 01:40.457
Well, during Thanksgiving,

01:40.500 --> 01:41.967
there was a lot of cheating
going on.

01:42.001 --> 01:43.434
How do you know that?

01:43.470 --> 01:44.562
Trust me.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.504
The question is,
What am I gonna do about it?

01:46.539 --> 01:48.473
Maybe you shouldn't do anything
about it.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:55.875 --> 02:57.001
I wish you were coming with.

02:57.076 --> 02:58.373
So do I.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.379
Three days on Balboa Island
sounds great right now.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.176
Three days on your best
behavior, you mean.

03:02.215 --> 03:04.274
I mean, the final selection
for Rose Queen is gonna

03:04.317 --> 03:06.478
be based on what the judges see
over the next three days.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.816
Yeah, I know.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.719
I don't have a choice;
I've been subpoenaed.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.951
I heard the selection
committee made arrangements

03:12.058 --> 03:13.958
for a car
to pick you up tomorrow.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.494
Yeah, they offered, but
I had to turn them down.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.292
I mean, I got Joe
into this mess.

03:18.331 --> 03:19.355
The least I can do

03:19.399 --> 03:20.866
is see him through
the whole thing.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.128
Well, we're gonna miss you.

03:22.168 --> 03:23.430
Thanks. Thanks
for your support, Lis.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.199
Well, we love you Donna.
Good luck.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.469
Yeah, you, too.

03:28.508 --> 03:29.941
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.482
Bye, Lis.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.652
Bye, Donna.
We'll miss you.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.899
It may not be the trial
of the century,

04:34.941 --> 04:38.240
but here in a small Los Angeles
courtroom,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.508
a football star is trying
to prove his innocence.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.606
California University
quarterback Joe Bradley faces

04:43.650 --> 04:45.277
a misdemeanor battery charge.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.981
Small potatoes for the average
Joe, but for this Joe,

04:49.022 --> 04:51.718
a conviction could signal
the end of the game,

04:51.758 --> 04:53.350
instead of the beginning

04:53.393 --> 04:55.588
of what could be a brilliant
professional career.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.169
Hey, Brandon,
is this a jury trial?

05:04.203 --> 05:05.932
Yeah, it was up to Joe.
He wanted one.

05:06.005 --> 05:07.097
Yeah?

05:07.140 --> 05:09.768
Well, I hope he made
the right decision.

05:09.809 --> 05:10.901
Will Bradley play

05:10.943 --> 05:12.376
in the conference
championship game?

05:12.412 --> 05:14.437
Not my call.
You'll have to ask the coach.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.311
If Bradley's found guilty,
will C.U. expel him?

05:16.349 --> 05:17.509
No comment.

05:17.550 --> 05:19.279
If he doesn't finish out
his college career,

05:19.319 --> 05:21.184
does he have any chance
in the pro draft?

05:21.220 --> 05:22.812
I'm a lawyer,
I'm not a football scout.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.846
That's it guys.
We've got work to do.

05:24.891 --> 05:25.880
Everybody back, please.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.324
Let's make a deal.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.191
He pleads.
Suspended sentence.

05:29.228 --> 05:30.195
Community service.

05:30.229 --> 05:31.787
We all take an early lunch.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.492
Okay, I'll take it to him.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.522
Sell it, would ya?

05:34.567 --> 05:37.229
I got a lot of work to do today.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.636
No deal.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.071
Joe, listen to him.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.405
Did you hear?

05:43.443 --> 05:45.240
He's promising no time in jail.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.370
Mom.

05:46.412 --> 05:49.279
What's this gonna do
to his career?

05:49.315 --> 05:50.282
I can't answer that.

05:50.316 --> 05:51.681
Football players

05:51.718 --> 05:54.812
have admitted to a lot worse
and still had great careers.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.982
If I'm found guilty,
I don't play, period.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.931
Tell the city attorney
I'll take my chances.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.159
You're the client, Joe.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.466
I'll see you inside.
Excuse me.

06:12.171 --> 06:13.729
This is all my fault.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.764
I should have lied
in the deposition

06:15.808 --> 06:17.275
and said that Ray
started the fight.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.834
Don't say that.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.368
You told the truth, and that's
more important than anything.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.643
We're going to get
through this, you'll see.

06:22.682 --> 06:26.243
Like your father always said:
"We take care of the details

06:26.285 --> 06:28.276
and let God take care
of the big picture."

06:28.321 --> 06:30.414
That's right.

06:30.456 --> 06:33.118
He also liked Vince Lombardi.
You know what he said.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.992
"Winning isn't everything.
It's the only thing."

06:39.832 --> 06:41.766
That's a good beginning.

06:41.801 --> 06:42.927
Thanks.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.529
I hope your story
has a happy ending.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.267
Yeah, me, too.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.502
See what I mean?

06:50.543 --> 06:54.104
Would you cut it out?

06:54.147 --> 06:55.637
Look, I know what I saw.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.308
It was 7:30 in the morning,

06:57.350 --> 06:59.113
and all she was wearing
was a shirt.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.518
Okay, maybe she
slept at Brandon's.

07:01.554 --> 07:03.215
That doesn't mean
she slept with him.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.190
Yeah, right.
I believe that.

07:05.224 --> 07:07.089
Why are we even
talking about this?

07:07.126 --> 07:08.218
It's none of our business.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.250
Look, Colin's my friend.

07:09.295 --> 07:10.387
I just don't want

07:10.430 --> 07:12.261
to see him get hurt, that's all.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.356
And Kelly's my stepsister,

07:13.399 --> 07:16.562
so why don't you
just stay out of it?

07:22.141 --> 07:24.371
Let's go, Mom.
It's time to go in.

07:46.532 --> 07:48.295
Is that him?

07:48.334 --> 07:49.961
Yeah.

07:50.069 --> 07:51.969
I'm sorry.

07:52.004 --> 07:53.972
I know this must be
very hard for you.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.167
Not as hard as it is for Joe.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.200
Donna?

07:58.244 --> 08:00.178
I'm sorry I'm late, sweetheart.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.737
Where's Daddy?

08:01.781 --> 08:04.682
He had emergency bypass surgery.
He'll try to be here tomorrow.

08:04.717 --> 08:06.241
Mrs. Martin, this is my mother.

08:06.285 --> 08:08.048
Oh, Mrs. Bradley,
how nice to meet you.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.520
Oh, please, call me Mary Ellen.

08:09.555 --> 08:10.647
I'm Felice.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.282
I just wish your trip
from Pennsylvania

08:12.325 --> 08:15.385
was under better circumstances.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.328
- You okay?
- Yeah.

08:20.099 --> 08:21.191
Oh, hi.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.031
Hurry, Don,
they're about to start.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.434
Okay.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.062
- Good luck, Joe.
- Thanks, Kel.

08:26.105 --> 08:27.800
- I'll be right in.
- All right.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.432
What are you doing here?

08:29.475 --> 08:30.442
Who's watching Erin?

08:30.476 --> 08:31.943
Oh, Colin.
And I have a feeling

08:31.978 --> 08:34.241
he's in way over his head,
so I'm gonna go call him.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.508
Go on in without me, okay?

08:35.548 --> 08:36.606
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.243
Everything's gonna be fine.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.830
That's great.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.831
You're a natural.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.924
What's a natural?

08:54.967 --> 08:56.525
Someone who can do this.

08:58.771 --> 09:00.432
Yah!

09:00.473 --> 09:01.838
I can do that.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.670
Excellent.
Excellent.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.407
Can you do this?

09:12.785 --> 09:15.015
Let me. Let me.

09:18.691 --> 09:21.319
That is so good.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.294
I'm a natural.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.557
You're a mess.

09:26.999 --> 09:29.058
Hang on for a second.

09:32.204 --> 09:33.171
Hello?

09:33.205 --> 09:34.695
Hi, how's it going?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.571
Great. Erin and I are making
you a present.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.076
Oh, that's nice.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.943
Don't forget to put her down
for her nap after lunch, okay?

09:40.980 --> 09:42.140
I won't forget.

09:42.181 --> 09:44.308
In fact, don't forget
to give her lunch.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.874
Kelly, I practically raised
four brothers.

09:45.918 --> 09:46.942
I know what I'm doing.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.385
I know. I'm sorry.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.683
It's just hard not to worry.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.587
Relax. Everything's fine.

09:51.624 --> 09:54.218
Now go back into court
and leave us alone, okay?

09:54.260 --> 09:55.227
Please?

09:55.261 --> 09:56.853
Okay. Give her a kiss for me.

09:56.896 --> 09:59.694
I will. See ya.

10:03.402 --> 10:04.960
I'm sorry.

10:05.037 --> 10:06.766
Oh, it's no problem.

10:06.806 --> 10:09.707
I'll have it set up
again in no time.

10:09.742 --> 10:10.970
I want to go home.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.066
We can't go home.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.169
Not yet.

10:13.212 --> 10:14.679
Not till Kelly
gets through in court.

10:14.714 --> 10:16.443
I miss my mama.

10:16.482 --> 10:18.677
Mommy will be back
in a couple of days.

10:18.718 --> 10:19.946
I want David.

10:19.986 --> 10:21.419
David's with Kelly, sweetheart.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.388
Don't you want to, don't you
want to paint anymore?

10:23.422 --> 10:24.684
I don't want to paint.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.521
I want to go home.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.792
May I approach the witness,
Your Honor?

10:31.831 --> 10:32.798
You may.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.594
Good morning, Donna.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.728
Good morning.

10:37.770 --> 10:38.828
Nervous?

10:38.871 --> 10:39.838
A little.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.464
Well, don't be.

10:41.507 --> 10:42.906
I just have a few questions.

10:42.942 --> 10:45.706
Halloween night, 1995.

10:45.745 --> 10:46.803
Remember where you were?

10:46.846 --> 10:49.974
At a party
at the Peach Pit After Dark.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.449
- A night club?
- Right.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.644
What time did you leave?

10:52.685 --> 10:53.652
Around 11:00.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.381
Who drove you home?

10:55.421 --> 10:56.786
Joe Bradley.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.380
Is Joe Bradley
in the courtroom today?

10:58.424 --> 10:59.948
Yes.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.425
Would you point him out
to us, please?

11:02.795 --> 11:04.592
Let the record show

11:04.630 --> 11:06.655
the witness has
identified the defendant.

11:06.699 --> 11:08.963
So Mr. Bradley took
you to your door.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.593
- Yes.
- And what happened

11:10.636 --> 11:11.762
after you said good night?

11:11.804 --> 11:13.066
Joe left.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.505
Did another gentleman
come to see you that night?

11:15.541 --> 11:17.202
Yes, Ray Pruit.

11:17.243 --> 11:19.268
Did you and Ray Pruit
have a conversation

11:19.311 --> 11:21.142
- on your deck that evening?
- Yes.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.477
During which
Mr. Bradley returned?

11:22.515 --> 11:23.812
Yes.

11:23.849 --> 11:24.975
And what happened then?

11:25.051 --> 11:27.110
Then Joe and Ray
got into a fight.

11:27.153 --> 11:28.120
A fistfight?

11:28.154 --> 11:29.121
Yes.

11:29.155 --> 11:32.283
Who threw the first punch?

11:32.324 --> 11:35.657
Joe did, but you
don't understand.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.287
Who threw the second punch,

11:37.329 --> 11:38.921
Miss Martin?

11:38.964 --> 11:40.022
Joe.

11:42.902 --> 11:46.269
Did Ray Pruit ever strike
Joe Bradley?

11:48.974 --> 11:50.100
No.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.109
Not once?

11:51.143 --> 11:53.407
Well, he, he ran at him.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.845
Did Mr. Pruit hit Joe Bradley?

11:56.449 --> 11:58.349
No.

12:02.988 --> 12:05.650
Nothing further.

12:05.691 --> 12:08.421
Miss Martin,

12:08.461 --> 12:12.363
before Mr. Pruit came out
of his hiding place...

12:12.398 --> 12:14.889
Objection, leading.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.060
Sustained.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.696
All right, I will rephrase.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.330
May I approach, Your Honor?

12:20.372 --> 12:21.964
- You may.
- Thank you,

12:24.076 --> 12:26.840
Miss Martin...

12:26.879 --> 12:32.317
did Mr. Pruit tell you why
he came to see you that night?

12:32.351 --> 12:36.219
Yes, he said he wanted
to tell me that he loved me

12:36.255 --> 12:38.485
and that we belonged together.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.082
He was very jealous of Joe.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.720
Objection. Move to strike
the last sentence.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.423
Sustained.

12:44.463 --> 12:47.091
Miss Martin, please do not
volunteer any information

12:47.133 --> 12:48.794
or make judgments, just answer
the question directly.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.893
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.837
What did you say
to Mr. Pruit?

12:53.873 --> 12:56.000
We'd been over it
a million times.

12:56.108 --> 12:58.201
I told him I didn't want
to talk about it.

12:58.244 --> 12:59.506
And then what did you do?

12:59.545 --> 13:02.070
I started to walk inside.

13:02.114 --> 13:06.915
And then what did Mr. Pruit
say at that point?

13:06.952 --> 13:08.852
He said, "Don't turn
your back on me."

13:08.888 --> 13:10.947
And then he grabbed my arm.

13:10.990 --> 13:14.050
I told him that he was hurting
me, but he, he wouldn't let go.

13:15.895 --> 13:17.385
And that's when Joe got there.

13:17.429 --> 13:18.896
And what did Joe,

13:18.931 --> 13:23.493
that is Mr. Bradley, say then?

13:23.536 --> 13:25.834
He told Ray to let me go.

13:25.871 --> 13:26.963
And did Mr. Pruit let go of you?

13:27.072 --> 13:28.767
No, he didn't.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.236
Had Mr. Pruit
ever hurt you before?

13:33.279 --> 13:34.769
Objection.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.179
Irrelevant.

13:36.215 --> 13:38.342
Your Honor, I'm trying
to establish

13:38.384 --> 13:39.976
a pattern of behavior here.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.350
Mr. Bradley has said
that Miss Martin

13:41.387 --> 13:42.854
needed his protection.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.152
I'd simply like to know what it
is she needed protection from.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.125
May we approach the bench?

13:47.159 --> 13:48.183
Sure.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.731
This is going to humiliate
Donna so much.

13:56.769 --> 14:00.364
Maybe, but for Joe's sake,
I hope he lets it in.

14:00.406 --> 14:01.395
The objection's overruled.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.670
Proceed, Mr. Paxton.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.506
Okay, Miss Martin,

14:08.547 --> 14:11.812
did Mr. Pruit ever
hurt you before?

14:11.851 --> 14:12.943
Yes.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.280
How?

14:15.888 --> 14:18.880
He threw me against a wall,

14:18.924 --> 14:22.257
and he shoved me down
a flight of stairs once.

14:22.294 --> 14:23.852
So, on Halloween night,
when Mr. Pruit

14:23.896 --> 14:27.662
grabbed your arm,
were you scared that he might

14:27.700 --> 14:28.962
do something worse?

14:29.068 --> 14:31.059
Yes, yes, I was.

14:32.771 --> 14:34.398
I was terrified.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.706
This court will
be adjourned for lunch

14:40.746 --> 14:42.805
until 2:00.

14:56.195 --> 14:59.995
Hey, guess where Joe was
at 6:00 this morning?

15:00.099 --> 15:01.794
Don't tell me... church.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.358
Seldom right and
wrong again, Sanders.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.269
He was on the practice field,
working his tail off,

15:06.305 --> 15:08.273
even though the coach
isn't gonna let him play.

15:08.307 --> 15:10.207
Talk about guts, man.
This guy never gives up.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.641
That's why I'll bet he gets off.

15:11.677 --> 15:12.769
You interested?

15:12.811 --> 15:14.335
Steve, I'm reporting
on the case.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.075
I have to remain impartial.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.104
What're you saying,
you want odds.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.946
I got to go.

15:19.018 --> 15:20.781
Susan's waiting
for me to file copy.

15:20.819 --> 15:22.218
Uh, are you gonna eat that?

15:22.254 --> 15:23.812
Knock yourself out.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.154
Thanks, don't mind if I "duty."

15:33.565 --> 15:37.126
A good portrait captures more
than the way someone looks.

15:37.169 --> 15:39.069
It captures the soul.

15:39.104 --> 15:40.196
You know what I mean?

15:41.907 --> 15:43.738
Of course you don't
know what I mean.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.266
I don't know what I mean.

15:47.079 --> 15:48.546
Well, that's it.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.241
You want to take a look?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.842
All right, come here.

15:55.154 --> 15:56.746
There. That's you.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.188
That's not me.

15:58.223 --> 15:59.451
It's not?

15:59.491 --> 16:00.788
Sure looks like you to me.

16:00.826 --> 16:01.850
Oh.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.225
Uh-oh.

16:03.262 --> 16:04.854
That's okay,
we'll get you a new one

16:04.897 --> 16:08.355
as soon as the ice cream truck
comes around, okay?

16:08.400 --> 16:09.765
I want one now.

16:19.011 --> 16:20.876
I don't know how
many column inches yet.

16:20.913 --> 16:22.244
I'm waiting for him to file.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.478
Newsroom. Keats.

16:26.518 --> 16:27.951
Hi, it's me.
I'm ready when you are.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.044
That's it?

16:29.088 --> 16:30.817
No, "Hello"?
No, "How are you?"

16:30.856 --> 16:32.118
I'm sorry.
Hello, how are you?

16:32.157 --> 16:33.624
I don't have time
for small talk, remember?

16:33.659 --> 16:34.751
We're on deadline.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.318
All right, I've got 500 words.

16:37.363 --> 16:38.853
Slug is, "American Hero."

16:38.897 --> 16:41.889
Well, listen, American hero,
I've got some news for you.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.926
The A.P. called and they want
you to string for them.

16:44.970 --> 16:46.198
The Associated Press, A.P.?

16:46.238 --> 16:47.364
That's the one.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.964
It seems they're having
a hard time

16:49.008 --> 16:50.600
getting an interview
with Bradley. He won't talk.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.633
And they figured, rightfully so,

16:52.678 --> 16:54.976
- that you might be able to get
to him. - Of course I can.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.504
I think I can...

16:56.548 --> 16:59.483
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.281
Congratulations, Walsh.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.220
You're covering
your first national story.

17:03.255 --> 17:04.654
Unbelievable.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.624
Listen, you don't have time
to get excited, remember?

17:06.657 --> 17:08.057
I'm still waiting for that copy.

17:08.093 --> 17:09.651
Yeah, okay. Where were we?

17:09.694 --> 17:11.356
Well, hold on a second.

17:16.101 --> 17:17.125
All right,

17:17.169 --> 17:18.500
start at the top. I'm typing.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.027
Okay...

17:20.071 --> 17:23.098
Joe, do you think C.U. can make
it to the Rose Bowl without you?

17:23.142 --> 17:24.939
I'm sorry, Mr. Bradley has
no comment at this point.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.034
Excuse us.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.238
- Hey, Joe...
- Hey, Brandon.

17:27.279 --> 17:28.837
Any chance I could get
a minute with you?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.815
- For you, sure. - Joe,
I told you... no interviews.

17:30.849 --> 17:33.249
- He's a friend. - I don't care
if he's Mike Wallace.

17:33.285 --> 17:36.311
Catch you later, man.

17:36.355 --> 17:37.947
Mr. Bradley,
is it your contention

17:38.023 --> 17:40.355
that you hit Mr. Pruit

17:40.392 --> 17:42.917
- in order to protect Miss
Martin? - Yes.

17:42.961 --> 17:44.292
Protect her from what?

17:44.329 --> 17:46.320
Ray was holding
her against her will.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.595
He was hurting her.

17:48.634 --> 17:50.864
After you "protected"
Miss Martin,

17:50.903 --> 17:52.268
did Mr. Pruit leave?

17:52.304 --> 17:53.601
Yes.

17:53.639 --> 17:56.437
And after that, what did you do?

17:56.475 --> 17:58.534
I'm sorry. I don't
understand the question.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.568
Did you file a police report?

18:00.612 --> 18:01.840
No.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.040
Did you call a doctor?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.413
No.

18:04.450 --> 18:06.213
Why wasn't medical treatment
sought?

18:06.251 --> 18:07.809
Because Donna didn't need any,
I guess.

18:07.853 --> 18:11.619
In other words,
there were no broken bones?

18:11.657 --> 18:13.022
No.

18:13.058 --> 18:14.116
No bruises?

18:14.159 --> 18:15.126
No.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.218
How about scratches?

18:16.261 --> 18:17.728
I don't know.

18:19.164 --> 18:22.099
This is a copy
of a police report

18:22.134 --> 18:23.431
filed by Ray Pruit

18:23.469 --> 18:25.699
about what happened that night.

18:25.737 --> 18:28.729
May I make this
people's exhibit 15.

18:28.774 --> 18:29.934
So marked.

18:30.008 --> 18:34.911
This is a medical report,
also filed by Mr. Pruit.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.039
Exhibit 16?

18:36.081 --> 18:37.207
So marked.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.375
Only one person

18:38.417 --> 18:40.681
was bruised and scratched
that night.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.482
Only one person's arm

18:42.521 --> 18:45.422
was so badly sprained
it required a cast.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.550
Would you tell the court
who that one person was?

18:51.697 --> 18:53.324
Pruit.

18:53.365 --> 18:54.923
Speak up, Mr. Bradley.

18:59.238 --> 19:00.830
I said Ray Pruit.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.804
I have no further questions.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.005
You may step down.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.279
Mr. Paxton?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.781
The defense calls
Valerie Malone.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.897
Please raise your right hand,

19:29.935 --> 19:31.800
I didn't know Valerie
was a witness.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.930
Yeah, she was subpoenaed
last week.

19:33.972 --> 19:35.200
She could really help.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.764
That's a switch.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.799
Usually the only person
she helps is herself.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.833
Shh.

19:41.313 --> 19:42.712
At least with Court TV,

19:42.748 --> 19:45.683
they give you a commercial break
so you can go take a pee.

19:45.717 --> 19:48.481
Miss Malone,

19:48.520 --> 19:50.954
you had occasion to stay
at the Rancho Las Palmas Hotel

19:51.056 --> 19:53.752
in Palm Springs last Memorial
Day weekend, is that correct?

19:53.792 --> 19:55.225
Correct.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.557
Now, after you checked in

19:56.595 --> 19:59.393
to your room in the hotel,

19:59.431 --> 20:01.331
did you witness
an argument between

20:01.366 --> 20:04.802
Mr. Pruit here and Donna Martin?

20:04.836 --> 20:06.531
Yes.

20:06.572 --> 20:07.869
What did you see?

20:07.906 --> 20:10.238
Well, I saw them yelling
at each other

20:10.275 --> 20:11.333
as they passed my room

20:11.376 --> 20:12.843
and walked up the stairs
to Donna's room.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.368
And then what?

20:14.413 --> 20:17.280
Well, after they reached
the landing of the stairs,

20:17.316 --> 20:18.613
Donna tried to walk away.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.641
Ray grabbed her and threw
her down the stairs.

20:20.686 --> 20:25.749
Now, are you sure
that she didn't trip?

20:25.791 --> 20:27.816
No. He threw her.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.158
Thank you very much,
Miss Malone.

20:32.197 --> 20:34.859
No further questions,
Your Honor.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.198
Because of the
lateness of the hour,

20:37.236 --> 20:40.330
court will stand in recess
until 8:30 tomorrow morning.

20:40.372 --> 20:41.532
Miss Malone, you may step down.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.275
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.546
Can you taste this for me?

20:55.220 --> 20:56.414
Is it good?

20:56.455 --> 20:58.582
- Mm. Yeah, it's very good.
- Good.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.285
What's the occasion?

21:00.325 --> 21:02.589
Well, after Valerie's
performance,

21:02.628 --> 21:04.653
Steve thinks we need
to celebrate.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.960
Yeah, well, Joe's not off yet.

21:07.065 --> 21:08.498
Besides, after hearing
Donna's testimony

21:08.533 --> 21:10.228
of what Ray did to her...

21:10.269 --> 21:12.430
I'm not really in the mood
to celebrate anything.

21:12.471 --> 21:13.961
Well, I hope you guys
are hungry,

21:14.072 --> 21:16.802
because Steve has enough on
that grill to feed an army.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.332
Brandon, Val, dinner!

21:18.377 --> 21:22.177
Come on Val, don't tell
me you're not hungry.

21:24.783 --> 21:27.308
I'll be down soon.

21:27.352 --> 21:30.719
I just want to catch my breath.

21:30.756 --> 21:33.247
You did good in there today.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.988
Nothing looks better in
court than an eyewitness.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.427
Well, I'm glad you think so.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.554
Why's that?

21:38.597 --> 21:42.397
You and Susan seem to be
getting along all right.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.197
Yeah, we are.

21:44.236 --> 21:47.205
Why shouldn't we be?

21:47.239 --> 21:49.969
Look, I know it's none
of my business,

21:50.008 --> 21:52.340
but I know about you and Kelly
spending the night together

21:52.377 --> 21:54.709
- at Thanksgiving.
- Hold on a second.

21:54.746 --> 21:55.838
Are you telling me
what I saw didn't happen?

21:55.881 --> 21:57.473
Brandon, are you coming down

21:57.516 --> 21:58.915
or do I have to come
up and get you?

21:58.950 --> 22:01.817
I'll be right there.

22:01.853 --> 22:04.344
We've been friends
for a long time, Val.

22:04.389 --> 22:07.017
You want to keep it that way?

22:26.278 --> 22:27.609
Hey, Joe.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.614
Hey, Brandon.
You're up early.

22:29.648 --> 22:32.344
Yeah, don't remind me... when I
said I wanted an interview,

22:32.384 --> 22:34.818
I didn't mean
at 6:00 in the morning.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.684
Too bad The Co <i>n</i> dor
doesn't pay overtime.

22:36.722 --> 22:37.882
The Co <i>n</i> dor doesn't

22:37.923 --> 22:40.551
pay much at all...
thankfully, the A.P. does.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.219
I didn't know I rated.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.888
Guess this counts as my
15 minutes of fame, huh?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.993
I usually read the sports page
while I'm doing this,

22:49.101 --> 22:51.934
see what the people are
writing about the team.

22:51.970 --> 22:54.939
Somehow... I'm just
not in the mood.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.271
What's the matter?

22:57.309 --> 23:00.005
Ligaments are gonna need
surgery in the off-season.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.605
This must seem
pretty surreal to you,

23:02.647 --> 23:04.808
being in this whole mess.

23:04.850 --> 23:08.308
Yeah. Everything
happens for a reason.

23:08.353 --> 23:10.719
You really believe
that, don't you?

23:11.757 --> 23:14.282
Yes, I do.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.352
Joe...

23:17.396 --> 23:20.126
what are you gonna do
if this doesn't work out?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.701
I play football.

23:23.735 --> 23:25.362
That's what I do.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.599
Yeah, but what if
this doesn't work out?

23:27.639 --> 23:29.402
It will.

23:29.441 --> 23:30.840
It has to.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.716
God, that woman
makes me nervous.

23:42.754 --> 23:45.314
Well, after Valerie's testimony,

23:45.357 --> 23:47.382
she's the one
who should be nervous.

23:47.426 --> 23:51.260
I'm just glad you don't have to
get back up on that stand again.

23:52.964 --> 23:55.262
Hey, Ray, you got a minute?

23:55.300 --> 23:56.494
No.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.435
Ma, go on in.

24:02.340 --> 24:05.070
You're doing the wrong
thing here, man.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.941
That's for the judge to decide.

24:06.978 --> 24:08.343
Look...

24:08.380 --> 24:10.245
you were hurting Donna,

24:10.282 --> 24:11.510
Joe was just trying
to protect her...

24:11.550 --> 24:12.608
you know that, and I know that.

24:12.651 --> 24:14.084
Look, you can't prove that.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.677
Ray...

24:15.720 --> 24:17.551
Have I ever done wrong by you?

24:17.589 --> 24:18.920
No.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.424
Then hear me out.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.484
All right.

24:22.527 --> 24:25.758
Sure, Donna left you
and found Joe,

24:25.797 --> 24:27.822
but you're not
the victim here, she is.

24:27.866 --> 24:30.596
The longer you keep this up,
you're just abusing her more.

24:30.635 --> 24:31.966
Is that what you want?

24:32.070 --> 24:34.163
Look, man, the city attorney
filed the charges.

24:34.206 --> 24:35.468
It's out of my hands.

24:35.507 --> 24:36.599
But Joe's innocent.

24:36.641 --> 24:37.903
That's not for me to say.

24:37.943 --> 24:40.639
Yes, it is.

24:41.813 --> 24:44.805
You're the only one who can.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.263
Are you ready to begin
cross, Miss Malone?

24:59.297 --> 25:00.696
Not at this time, Your Honor.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.256
Instead, I would like to recall

25:02.300 --> 25:04.029
Donna Martin to the stand.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.035
Why are they doing this?

25:08.073 --> 25:09.472
I don't know.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.669
You'll be all right.

25:21.987 --> 25:25.218
Remember, Miss Martin,
you are still under oath.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.054
- Yes, Your Honor.
- On the afternoon

25:27.092 --> 25:30.118
of May 27, 1995,

25:30.161 --> 25:31.685
were you admitted to
Desert Springs Hospital

25:31.730 --> 25:33.493
in Palm Springs, California?

25:33.532 --> 25:34.794
Yes.

25:34.833 --> 25:36.061
Do you recall why

25:36.101 --> 25:37.728
- you were admitted?
- I sprained my arm.

25:37.769 --> 25:39.498
- May I approach?
- You may.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.799
Is this a copy
of your admitting record

25:44.843 --> 25:46.333
from the emergency room?

25:46.378 --> 25:48.175
It looks like it.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.943
Among other things,
it lists your name, address, age

25:50.982 --> 25:52.813
and cause of injury,
does it not?

25:52.851 --> 25:54.216
Yes, it does.

25:54.252 --> 25:55.651
And at the bottom of the form,

25:55.687 --> 25:57.245
is there a disclaimer warning

25:57.289 --> 25:59.655
that it is against the law
to give false information?

25:59.691 --> 26:01.682
- Yes. - And did you sign
that disclaimer?

26:01.726 --> 26:02.886
Yes.

26:02.928 --> 26:05.658
Now, next to the question,
"cause of injury,"

26:05.697 --> 26:08.063
what did you tell
the admitting nurse?

26:14.739 --> 26:16.900
He... he was my boyfriend.

26:18.443 --> 26:20.343
I was trying to protect him.

26:20.378 --> 26:21.675
Answer the question,
Miss Martin.

26:23.248 --> 26:24.340
Miss Martin.

26:25.383 --> 26:27.681
Miss Martin, what did you say

26:27.719 --> 26:30.552
was the cause of your injury?

26:33.191 --> 26:35.716
I fell.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.456
You're saying you lied?

26:40.131 --> 26:41.530
Yes.

26:41.566 --> 26:42.965
To protect your old boyfriend?

26:44.569 --> 26:46.196
Yes.

26:46.237 --> 26:48.728
How do we know you're not lying
now to protect your new one?

26:48.773 --> 26:49.797
Objection.

26:49.841 --> 26:52.332
Withdrawn.

26:54.379 --> 26:57.974
Now I know what they mean
when they say justice is blind.

26:58.049 --> 27:00.517
And deaf and dumb.

27:00.552 --> 27:03.043
What are your chances now, Joe?

27:03.088 --> 27:04.578
Fourth and long, Bradley...
you gonna go for it or punt?

27:04.623 --> 27:06.454
Come on, Bradley, didn't they
offer you something up front?

27:06.491 --> 27:08.220
Miss Martin,
is this gonna impact

27:08.259 --> 27:10.090
your chances
of making Rose Queen?

27:10.128 --> 27:12.255
- Come on, Joe, what are your
thoughts? - Come on, Joe!

27:12.297 --> 27:14.595
- Come on! - All right, all right,
that's it, that's it.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.930
That's enough.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.400
Donna!

27:17.435 --> 27:19.130
- I'm sorry, Joe.
- Don't be.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.331
If I had just told
the truth on that form,

27:21.373 --> 27:23.068
if I had just stood up to Ray,

27:23.108 --> 27:24.939
- none of this would be
happening. - How many times

27:25.010 --> 27:27.069
do I have to tell you...
it's not your fault.

27:27.112 --> 27:29.808
I lied for him but not for you.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.748
I would never want
you to lie for me.

27:31.783 --> 27:33.216
Yeah, well, look where
the truth has gotten us.

27:33.251 --> 27:34.616
This could ruin your life.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.416
Hey, like everything else
in life,

27:36.454 --> 27:38.012
the truth has its price.

27:44.462 --> 27:46.555
Hey, Nat, thanks for taking care
of the deliveries for me.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.896
Aw, forget it... your place
is in court with Donna.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.457
- Hey Colin, you all set?
- Yep.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.696
- Cool.
- All set. Thanks.

27:51.736 --> 27:52.862
Oh, you still baby-sitting?

27:52.904 --> 27:54.804
One more night.
Thank God.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.670
I mean, Erin's
a terrific kid, but...

27:56.708 --> 27:58.972
no matter how terrific she is,
she's still a kid.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.602
Well, I think
you're pretty terrific

28:00.645 --> 28:02.704
doing this for Kelly,
considering.

28:02.747 --> 28:04.078
Considering what?

28:09.587 --> 28:11.919
Okay.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.514
All set. Your toys.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.259
Oh, let me put 'em in.

28:18.296 --> 28:20.264
All right,
you can put 'em in.

28:20.298 --> 28:21.856
Here you go.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.492
Ooh, that must be Colin
with dinner.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.127
I'll be right back.

28:29.674 --> 28:32.336
I'm so glad you're here...
I'm starved.

28:35.947 --> 28:37.471
Let me ask you something.

28:37.515 --> 28:39.540
Did you have it all planned out?

28:39.584 --> 28:41.745
- Did I have all what planned
out? - Or were you just

28:41.786 --> 28:43.310
overcome by the heat
of the moment?

28:43.354 --> 28:45.049
- What?
- You know, it's not every day

28:45.090 --> 28:47.058
I find out my girlfriend
is sleeping with her ex.

28:47.092 --> 28:48.320
What are you talking about?

28:48.359 --> 28:50.293
You and Brandon
probably couldn't wait.

28:50.328 --> 28:51.727
I bet I hadn't even landed
in New York

28:51.763 --> 28:52.957
by the time you two
started screwing around.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.929
Look, I don't know
where you came up with this,

28:54.966 --> 28:56.957
but nothing happened between me
and Brandon while you were gone.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.399
You spent the night
at his house.

28:58.436 --> 29:00.131
Yeah, yeah, I was tired...
I slept over.

29:00.171 --> 29:01.433
I didn't want to drive home.

29:01.473 --> 29:02.565
You expect me to believe that?

29:02.607 --> 29:04.837
Yes, I do...
it was completely innocent.

29:04.876 --> 29:06.309
Valerie didn't think
it was so innocent.

29:06.344 --> 29:09.074
Wh-What does Valerie
have to do with it?

29:09.114 --> 29:10.411
Valerie saw you in the morning

29:10.448 --> 29:11.540
with nothing
but Brandon's shirt!

29:11.583 --> 29:13.312
Oh, so naturally
she jumped to the conclusion

29:13.351 --> 29:14.409
that we slept together?

29:14.452 --> 29:15.578
This is not about Valerie.

29:15.620 --> 29:16.609
This is about you,

29:16.654 --> 29:17.643
and what you did.

29:17.689 --> 29:18.917
Look, I didn't do anything.

29:19.023 --> 29:21.457
You can believe whoever
you want; that's up to you.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.687
I'm gonna go give Erin

29:22.727 --> 29:24.217
her bath.

29:27.565 --> 29:29.226
Oh, my God! Colin!

29:31.202 --> 29:33.170
She fell in the tub! Here!

29:33.204 --> 29:35.195
Call 911. Call 911.

29:39.410 --> 29:40.934
Come on, breathe, baby.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.173
Breathe, baby.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.947
Come on, Erin.
Come on, Erin!

29:46.985 --> 29:49.078
Come on, Erin.
Come on.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.519
Yes, she fell in the tub.

29:50.555 --> 29:52.147
- She's not breathing.
- Come on, Erin!

29:52.190 --> 29:53.214
Come on, Erin!

29:53.258 --> 29:55.249
No, he's doing CPR right now.

29:55.293 --> 29:58.194
1610 Lighthouse Road.

29:59.230 --> 30:00.527
One, two...

30:00.565 --> 30:01.896
Come on, baby, breathe!

30:01.933 --> 30:02.957
- Breathe!
- Come on.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.061
One, two, three, four, five.

30:06.104 --> 30:07.969
Breathe!

30:08.039 --> 30:08.835
- Breathe!
- Come on!

30:08.873 --> 30:10.568
...two, three, four, five.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.273
Breathe! Come on, baby!

30:15.380 --> 30:17.007
Oh, yes! Yes!

30:17.715 --> 30:19.182
You're okay, baby!

30:19.217 --> 30:20.707
You're...

30:20.752 --> 30:22.549
Yes, you're okay!

30:22.587 --> 30:24.646
Oh, everything's gonna be okay.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.517
Are you okay?

30:28.560 --> 30:31.393
Are you okay?

30:34.098 --> 30:36.623
Here it is,
coming over the wires

30:36.668 --> 30:38.431
into newsrooms
across the country...

30:38.469 --> 30:39.993
your first syndicated story.

30:40.038 --> 30:42.598
How many papers do you
think will pick it up?

30:42.640 --> 30:43.732
Couple hundred, at least.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.333
People from L.A. to New York

30:45.376 --> 30:46.866
will be drinking
their morning coffee,

30:46.911 --> 30:48.902
reading a story
with your byline.

30:51.482 --> 30:53.746
Thanks for giving me the shot.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.015
Oh, no. You've got what it takes

30:56.054 --> 30:57.988
to be a great
newspaperman, Brandon.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.115
You're smart, you're curious,

31:00.158 --> 31:01.819
and most importantly,
you're honest.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.852
Well, two out of three
ain't bad.

31:04.896 --> 31:07.558
Wh-Which one trips you up?

31:10.101 --> 31:12.569
Honesty.

31:17.008 --> 31:20.205
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

31:20.245 --> 31:21.678
Uh...

31:23.348 --> 31:26.181
Over Thanksgiving...

31:26.217 --> 31:28.777
Kelly spent the night
at my house.

31:30.188 --> 31:31.450
We didn't sleep together.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.514
We didn't even sleep
in the same room.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.558
Well, you thought about it.

31:38.596 --> 31:39.995
What stopped you?

31:40.064 --> 31:43.090
My feelings for you.

31:43.134 --> 31:45.967
Kelly's feelings for Colin.

31:46.004 --> 31:48.336
How noble.

31:51.042 --> 31:54.478
So if nothing happened,
why are you telling me about it?

31:54.512 --> 31:57.447
I think you have
a right to know.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.949
And...

31:58.983 --> 32:01.918
I want to apologize.

32:01.953 --> 32:03.818
It was thoughtless.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.345
Yeah, you got that right.

32:06.791 --> 32:09.624
So what, now we just go on
as if nothing happened?

32:09.661 --> 32:11.253
Nothing did.

32:11.296 --> 32:13.321
How am I supposed
to ever trust you again?

32:15.967 --> 32:17.764
I'm telling you the truth.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.736
You know what?
I'm not sure I believe you.

32:19.771 --> 32:20.635
You should.

32:20.672 --> 32:21.730
Well, I don't!

32:21.773 --> 32:23.934
Okay?

32:26.911 --> 32:28.674
Okay.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.949
I hope her dreams are sweet.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.475
She deserves them.

33:08.519 --> 33:10.953
I don't know what I would have
done if you weren't here.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.889
If I wasn't here, we
wouldn't have been arguing

33:12.924 --> 33:15.358
and it probably wouldn't have
happened in the first place.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.088
Kind of puts things in
perspective, doesn't it?

33:17.128 --> 33:18.959
Just for the record,
I want you to know

33:18.997 --> 33:20.658
that nothing happened
between me and Brandon.

33:20.698 --> 33:23.166
Kelly...

33:23.201 --> 33:25.294
Do you love me?

33:25.336 --> 33:27.304
Yes.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.670
That's all I needed to hear.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.160
Hey! Guys, I just
want to tell you,

33:54.198 --> 33:57.133
whatever happens in there today,
you both stood really tall.

33:57.168 --> 33:58.328
I read your article about Joe.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.461
Thank you, Brandon.

33:59.504 --> 34:00.835
- Good luck.
- Thanks, I'll need it.

34:02.173 --> 34:03.265
Just keep walking.

34:03.307 --> 34:04.638
No, no, I'll meet you inside.

34:11.215 --> 34:12.614
You make me sick.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.847
I thought Colin
had a right to know.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.478
And what about everybody else?

34:17.522 --> 34:19.786
I know you don't care
about me or Susan, but...

34:19.824 --> 34:21.951
what about Brandon?

34:21.993 --> 34:23.426
Why would you
do this to Brandon?

34:23.460 --> 34:25.360
Look, I saw what I saw.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.830
If I misinterpreted
things, I'm sorry.

34:27.864 --> 34:29.958
Besides, it looks like you
guys are closer than ever.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.297
What? Am I supposed
to thank you?

34:32.335 --> 34:33.928
Just get off my case.

34:33.971 --> 34:35.335
You know what, Valerie?

34:35.373 --> 34:38.308
One of these days your insidious
little personality disorder

34:38.342 --> 34:39.969
is gonna get you in big trouble.

34:40.011 --> 34:42.002
I just hope
I'm around to enjoy it.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.621
So, Mr. Pruit, you're saying
that on that night

34:53.658 --> 34:55.717
you were not
hurting Miss Martin?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.523
That's right.

34:57.562 --> 34:58.620
What about other nights?

34:58.663 --> 35:01.393
Did you ever hurt her?

35:01.432 --> 35:04.458
Objection, there's only
one night in question here.

35:04.502 --> 35:06.265
Your Honor has already ruled
that I be allowed

35:06.304 --> 35:08.295
to establish a pattern of abuse.

35:08.339 --> 35:11.240
It kills me to listen to this.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.708
The objection is overruled.
Continue, counselor.

35:12.743 --> 35:14.267
So, Mr. Pruit...

35:16.247 --> 35:17.908
...did you ever hurt
Miss Martin?

35:17.949 --> 35:20.179
No. Never.

35:26.324 --> 35:27.951
That is, uh, not intentionally.

35:27.992 --> 35:29.050
Not intentionally?

35:29.093 --> 35:30.060
What do you mean by that?

35:30.094 --> 35:32.961
That if I ever hurt her...

35:32.997 --> 35:34.191
Move to strike.

35:34.232 --> 35:35.256
Overruled.

35:37.568 --> 35:39.126
You may continue, Mr. Pruit.

35:42.540 --> 35:45.236
That if I ever hurt her,
it was only because I loved her.

35:45.276 --> 35:48.575
If you hurt her, it was only
because you loved her.

35:48.613 --> 35:50.740
Like on Halloween night?

35:50.781 --> 35:54.649
Isn't that what happened,
Mr. Pruit?

35:54.685 --> 35:55.652
Yes.

35:55.686 --> 35:56.880
Objection. Argumentative.

35:56.921 --> 35:57.910
Overruled.

35:57.955 --> 35:59.582
Why don't you tell us

35:59.624 --> 36:01.251
what happened
that night, Mr. Pruit?

36:03.628 --> 36:08.588
Donna wouldn't talk to me,
so I, uh, I grabbed her... hard,

36:08.633 --> 36:11.261
and she said
that I was hurting her,

36:11.302 --> 36:13.793
but I wouldn't stop.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.932
I couldn't.

36:16.974 --> 36:18.305
And...

36:20.978 --> 36:23.378
...that's when, uh,
that's when Joe showed up.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.874
And he's telling the truth.

36:33.991 --> 36:36.687
He was defending her.

36:40.364 --> 36:42.423
In view of this admission,
Your Honor,

36:42.466 --> 36:45.299
I move that we drop the charges.

36:45.336 --> 36:46.530
Motion is granted.

36:46.571 --> 36:47.970
This case is dismissed.

36:49.807 --> 36:51.331
Mr. Pruit, you may step down.

36:51.375 --> 36:54.173
Ladies and gentlemen of
the jury, thank you very much.

36:54.212 --> 36:55.440
You're excused.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.247
Am I dreaming?

37:05.289 --> 37:06.779
No, you're wide awake.

37:06.824 --> 37:08.155
We both are.

37:08.192 --> 37:09.682
It's over.

37:13.497 --> 37:14.589
Miss Martin.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.359
You give me a deposition,

37:18.402 --> 37:21.667
I'll give you Ray Pruit
behind bars, six months minimum.

37:21.706 --> 37:23.230
Jail?

37:24.442 --> 37:25.568
I don't think so.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.874
You change your mind,
give me a call.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.504
Thanks.

37:43.527 --> 37:45.825
Ray!

37:45.863 --> 37:47.956
I hope you're happy now.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.627
Mom, please.

37:50.668 --> 37:51.999
I'll be having a smoke.

37:54.538 --> 37:55.971
So, you're talking to me now.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.770
I want to make a deal with you.

37:57.808 --> 37:59.833
At this point, I figured
all the deals were off.

37:59.877 --> 38:03.904
Well, that prosecutor wants me
to bring charges against you.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.607
Ray, I don't want
to see you behind bars.

38:07.652 --> 38:10.917
What I want is for you
to stay in therapy,

38:10.955 --> 38:13.583
and to make your next
relationship a good one.

38:13.624 --> 38:14.613
A nice one.

38:14.659 --> 38:18.117
I can try.

38:18.162 --> 38:21.791
Try hard.

38:21.832 --> 38:24.926
For your own sake,
please try hard.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.485
Finishing up your story?

38:45.523 --> 38:46.854
Just writing a postscript.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.956
Listen, I have to tell you this.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.487
I told Colin about Thanksgiving.

38:55.666 --> 38:56.963
What?

38:57.001 --> 38:58.628
I know you told me not to,
but...

38:58.669 --> 39:00.330
I couldn't help myself.

39:00.371 --> 39:02.202
Have you completely
lost your mind?

39:02.239 --> 39:03.763
He and Kelly are fine
about it, I swear.

39:03.808 --> 39:05.275
That's great.

39:05.309 --> 39:07.072
What do you want me to do,
give you a medal?

39:07.111 --> 39:09.238
No.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.338
But how about, forgive me?

39:10.381 --> 39:12.110
I love you, Val. I'm not stupid.

39:12.149 --> 39:15.050
Look, I know I'm a gossip
sometimes, but I don't mean it.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.075
Please?

39:24.628 --> 39:25.993
Don't do it again.

39:27.631 --> 39:28.825
I won't.

39:34.505 --> 39:35.563
Ray.

39:35.606 --> 39:37.506
What are you doing here?

39:37.541 --> 39:38.906
I came to say thanks.

39:38.943 --> 39:40.137
What for?

39:40.177 --> 39:41.769
Well, I should have
listened to you earlier.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.302
If I had, uh...

39:43.347 --> 39:45.144
things never would've gotten
so out of control.

39:45.182 --> 39:47.116
You got to believe me, man.

39:47.151 --> 39:50.416
I, uh... I wanted to tell
the truth for a long time.

39:50.454 --> 39:51.944
Well, now you did.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.149
Yeah, I feel like
a big weight's been lifted.

39:54.191 --> 39:55.658
I just hope it wasn't too late.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.956
No one's gonna forget
what you did in there today.

39:59.997 --> 40:01.089
I won't let 'em.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.032
I appreciate that.

40:05.669 --> 40:07.136
So, uh...

40:07.171 --> 40:08.433
you got any plans?

40:08.472 --> 40:10.372
Well, there's always music.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.103
I think I'm gonna
hit the road again.

40:13.677 --> 40:15.201
So, I guess it's good-bye.

40:15.246 --> 40:17.578
Good luck, man.

40:17.615 --> 40:20.106
Thanks, man.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.243
Anything I can do?

40:21.285 --> 40:22.843
Yeah. You could, uh...

40:22.887 --> 40:26.345
tell Donna that I loved her,
and I'm sorry for what I did.

40:26.390 --> 40:28.483
You got it.

40:28.526 --> 40:29.652
Tell her not to worry.

40:29.693 --> 40:32.491
I promise I'll never
bother her again.

40:43.808 --> 40:46.174
So one...

40:46.210 --> 40:48.542
one story to the A.P.
and now you feel compelled

40:48.579 --> 40:50.274
to bring that laptop
with you everywhere.

40:50.314 --> 40:51.542
Why don't you put it away?

40:51.582 --> 40:53.174
- Steve, the story's not over.
- You look like

40:53.217 --> 40:54.548
- you're doing homework.
- It's not over.

40:54.585 --> 40:56.746
- I got a good feeling about
this. - A good feeling?

40:56.787 --> 40:59.221
Ha. I got a great feeling.
I got 50 bucks

40:59.256 --> 41:01.281
- riding on Donna. - Who'd you get
to bet against her?

41:01.325 --> 41:02.519
One of the other girls' mothers.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.822
Steve!

41:03.861 --> 41:04.953
Just kidding.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.587
No, you're not.

41:09.567 --> 41:11.626
Susan.

41:11.669 --> 41:13.830
I didn't think you
were gonna show up.

41:13.871 --> 41:18.570
I, uh, wasn't sure if I was.

41:18.609 --> 41:19.633
I overreacted.

41:19.677 --> 41:21.645
I don't, I'm really sorry.

41:21.679 --> 41:22.976
Me, too.

41:24.014 --> 41:26.642
Good.

41:26.684 --> 41:28.311
Well, you gonna
kiss me or what?

41:28.352 --> 41:29.512
Oh, okay.

41:31.922 --> 41:33.981
Hey, here they are.

41:34.024 --> 41:35.855
Here they come.

41:35.893 --> 41:38.589
Oh, Donna looks beautiful.

41:38.629 --> 41:40.119
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

41:45.236 --> 41:46.669
After all these months,
I can't believe

41:46.704 --> 41:48.001
the moment's finally here.

41:48.038 --> 41:49.665
I just want to get it
over with.

41:49.707 --> 41:51.004
Well, no matter what happens,

41:51.041 --> 41:52.531
I'm just happy
to be a part of it

41:52.576 --> 41:54.703
and happy to have met you.

41:56.013 --> 41:58.538
Ladies and gentlemen,
let me say it has been

41:58.582 --> 42:01.517
a pleasure to get to know all

42:01.552 --> 42:04.680
of the young women
of the 1996 Royal Court.

42:04.722 --> 42:07.384
All of them are
uniformly impressive,

42:07.424 --> 42:10.552
but we did, finally,
have to make a choice.

42:10.594 --> 42:14.496
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is my pleasure to present

42:14.532 --> 42:16.261
to you the 107th

42:16.300 --> 42:20.430
Tournament of Roses
Rose Queen... Lisa Dixon.

42:28.779 --> 42:30.644
I can't believe it.

42:30.681 --> 42:32.239
Oh, you deserve it.

42:59.043 --> 43:00.635
You'll always be our queen.

43:00.678 --> 43:02.475
I'm sorry, honey.

43:02.513 --> 43:03.810
I'm not.

43:03.847 --> 43:05.940
If you hadn't spent
so much time at the trial,

43:05.983 --> 43:07.143
I bet you would have won.

43:07.184 --> 43:09.675
Maybe, but if I had it
to do all over again,

43:09.720 --> 43:11.517
I wouldn't change a thing.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.484
- Don...
- Donna...

43:14.525 --> 43:15.787
Honey.

43:17.895 --> 43:20.955
"Joe Bradley will get
to play football again.

43:20.998 --> 43:23.432
There'll be games he'll
win and games he'll lose,

43:23.467 --> 43:26.959
but one thing he's learned
from his day in court...

43:27.004 --> 43:28.369
victory isn't always measured

43:28.405 --> 43:30.635
by how many points
you put up on the board

43:30.674 --> 43:32.642
or whether you win the crown.

43:32.676 --> 43:35.338
Sometimes it's measured
by what's in your heart.
