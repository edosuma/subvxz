00:33.207 --> 00:34.991
Not sure why you all
were called in.

00:35.078 --> 00:36.732
We could handle it.

Mr. Sands' wife Jennifer
arrived home last night

00:51.094 --> 00:52.487
with their daughter
about 9:00.

where his family is?

01:10.374 --> 01:12.507
Uh, with friends.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.161
Mrs. Sands thought
it would be best

01:14.248 --> 01:15.901
for the little girl
and we agreed.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.338
Any sign of forced entry?

01:17.425 --> 01:18.904
No, it must have been
a front door job

He's a consultant.

Sorry, Gandalf.

we did look around pretty good.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.854
He's not here.

01:55.941 --> 01:58.988
He's here, and there's
no such thing as psychics.

02:00.424 --> 02:01.904
He was tortured
in this chair..

a pass code..

humor me, inspector?

that sheet of paper?

- Thanks.

must have moved.

02:30.976 --> 02:33.153
After these papers were spread
all over the floor?

02:34.458 --> 02:37.766
It's a door.
To a safe?

02:37.853 --> 02:40.203
- Or a safe room.
- Yes.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.336
The intruder must have
been distracted by something

'left Sands alone for a moment,
Sands punches in the code'

02:46.818 --> 02:48.690

the door behind him.'

press the buttons a lot?

02:54.348 --> 02:56.698
I'm entering the top ten

02:56.785 --> 02:58.526
But if it is a safe room

02:58.613 --> 03:00.963
wouldn't it have a silent alarm
connected to a security company?

03:03.008 --> 03:05.228
Not if you're the paranoid,

11:51.232 --> 11:54.714
with nothing but
massive debts, penniless.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.150
We're gonna have
to sell the house

11:56.237 --> 11:59.196
and, and, and, and
everything else we own.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.285
I'm so sorry.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.461
The IRS. And the SEC
And I don't know who else

12:03.548 --> 12:05.159
were investigating him
for fraud.

12:05.246 --> 12:09.772
- He told you nothing?
- Nothing. Nothing.

12:09.859 --> 12:12.601
Turns out our,
our marriage was a lie.

12:12.688 --> 12:17.040
Our, our whole life
together was a lie.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.173
Perhaps he was ashamed
in his failure.

12:19.260 --> 12:22.524
No. Ashamed? Jason?

12:22.611 --> 12:25.875
No. I always knew
he had a secretive

12:25.962 --> 12:27.572
mistrustful side
but this?

12:27.659 --> 12:29.487
Every couple has secrets.

12:29.574 --> 12:31.533
There are rooms in this house
I didn't even know were there.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.058
Mrs. Sands,
you asked me..

12:35.145 --> 12:37.017
[sighs]

12:37.104 --> 12:38.453
...to help you.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.194
- Yes.
- How can I do that?

12:42.109 --> 12:45.460
If I know Jason, he, he,
there's something left.

12:45.547 --> 12:48.028
He would have hid
a nest egg somewhere.

12:48.115 --> 12:49.899
Don't you think
it's possible?

12:49.986 --> 12:51.988
Whoever killed him
certainly thought so.

12:52.075 --> 12:54.338
[banging on door]

12:59.779 --> 13:01.128
Sheriff's department.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.001
What is this? Who are you?

13:05.088 --> 13:08.744
Asset seizure. No trouble.
Start upstairs, boys.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.790
CBI. Department of justice.
Hang on a second.

13:12.922 --> 13:17.057
Mm-hmm. Yeah,
this is in order but, uh

13:17.144 --> 13:18.580
where's your lethal
toxins immunization papers?

13:18.667 --> 13:20.321
Excuse me?

13:20.408 --> 13:22.584
Did they not tell you the score
here?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.368
Did you get your shots?

13:24.455 --> 13:25.805
Shots?
What are you talking about?

13:25.892 --> 13:28.155
Shots.
There was a murder here.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.070
- Yeah, I know.
- Excuse me a minute.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.336
Suspected poisoning.

13:38.252 --> 13:39.470
[whispers]
Anthrax.

13:42.256 --> 13:45.302
Come on. Let's, uh,
let's go, guys.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.391
Get your shots.
We'll talk.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.784
[scoffs]
Shots.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.178
[indistinct chattering]

13:51.265 --> 13:53.397
[door closes]

13:53.484 --> 13:55.660
[Lisbon]
'Looks like sands
was bust alright.'

13:55.747 --> 13:59.447
He used to be huge, but he made
some really bad calls in IT.

13:59.534 --> 14:01.362
Over the past five years
his business

14:01.449 --> 14:04.017
'has dwindled down to almost
nothing. No clients.'

14:04.104 --> 14:06.541
'No income. There were
indictments and injunctions'

14:06.628 --> 14:08.456
and the whole nightmare coming,
just down the road.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.501
The strange thing is,
until a couple of weeks ago

14:10.588 --> 14:12.634
there was $10 million
in his personal accounts

14:12.721 --> 14:14.375
in cash and bonds and stocks

14:14.462 --> 14:15.593
'most of it deposited
over the last year.'

14:15.680 --> 14:16.899
His business
is dead for years.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.161
Where do you get
$10 million from?

14:18.248 --> 14:19.728
More importantly,
where is it now?

14:19.815 --> 14:21.338
That's what his killers
wanted to know. Hey.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.906
Are you sure the widow
doesn't know where it is?

14:23.993 --> 14:28.432
No, she's genuinely broke
and genuinely scared.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.043
You're not soft on her,
are you?

14:30.130 --> 14:32.784
No. Maybe a little.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.177
We need to talk
to the lawyer. What's his--

14:34.264 --> 14:36.658
Bennett?
Weneed to talk to him.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.965
You need to stay well away.

14:39.052 --> 14:40.488
Did you say maybe a little?

14:40.575 --> 14:42.316
She's a gorgeous,
grieving widow.

14:42.403 --> 14:45.101
Of course maybe a little.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.798
Don't worry. It's not going
to affect my work.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.237
I'm a law enforcement
professional. Jeez.

14:51.499 --> 14:52.761
[whistles]

14:55.459 --> 14:57.897
my sincere apologies for
our operative Jane, by the way.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.637
Unconscionable.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.379
Supervising Agent Minelli
gave him a severe reprimand.

15:02.466 --> 15:05.121
Well, think nothing of it.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.732
I can't tell you
how sad I am about all this.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.343
How can I help?

15:09.430 --> 15:11.562
I'll try and be brief.
You were Sands' lawyer.

15:11.649 --> 15:14.261
You had to have known
he was in ruinous debt.

15:14.348 --> 15:15.740
Yeah, I knew there
were difficulties

15:15.827 --> 15:18.874
but I had no idea
how deep he was in it.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.920
I don't deal
in his business affairs.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.573
I'm his family lawyer

15:22.660 --> 15:24.967
so I look after his
personal financial matters

15:25.054 --> 15:26.621
which until recently,
were in pretty good shape.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.363
Yeah, two weeks ago,
he converted a $10 million

15:29.450 --> 15:32.192
pension account into cash.
It's pretty much all he had.

15:32.279 --> 15:33.976
Which is his right.
I learned about it

15:34.063 --> 15:36.152
after the fact
from his accountants.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.633
It's a huge withdrawal

15:38.720 --> 15:41.201
but, uh, of course, I figured
he had much more in reserve.

15:41.288 --> 15:44.334
Did you ask him what he was
doing with the money?

15:44.421 --> 15:48.382
I did. He told me he needed it
to surprise his wife.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.601
He did that alright.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.473
I believed him.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.040
What do you believe now?

15:54.127 --> 15:55.780
I think he was looking
at jail time.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.304
I think he grabbed
as much cash as he could

15:57.391 --> 15:58.827
and he was gonna run away.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.872
Thanks for your help, counselor.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.222
- We'll be in touch.
- Okay.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.572
Whatever you need,
I'm at your service.

16:04.659 --> 16:07.836
Hey. We found out where
that money was coming from.

16:07.923 --> 16:10.273
Sands owns an office supply
company that supplies

16:10.360 --> 16:13.059
this Happy Landings
Entertainment with copy paper.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.931
Over the last 2 years,
$55.2 million worth.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.020
Who owns
Happy Landings Entertainment?

16:18.107 --> 16:19.935
It's a shell company
hidden in a Swiss trust

16:20.022 --> 16:21.632
wrapped in
a dummy corporation.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.635
It'll take a while to untangle.
But Sands' company?

16:24.722 --> 16:26.159
It's the only one
of his businesses

16:26.246 --> 16:27.421
under a separate
corporate address.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.684
- In Sausalito?
- Odd, huh?

16:29.771 --> 16:31.729
- Nice work.
- Are we gonna have a look?

16:31.816 --> 16:34.384
Weare. You're gonna stay hereand keep digging.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.430
Who owns
Happy Landings Entertainment?

16:37.779 --> 16:40.347
[instrumental music]

16:42.740 --> 16:45.178
Huh. Doesn't look like
a copy paper business, does it?

16:45.265 --> 16:47.006
Uh, no.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.138
This is it.
You coming aboard?

16:49.225 --> 16:51.184
Why not?

16:51.271 --> 16:53.664
[Cho]
'If Sands lied about this,
what else did he cover up?'

16:57.929 --> 16:59.627
[gate closes]

17:01.194 --> 17:04.066
[instrumental music]

17:22.563 --> 17:23.999
[Lisbon]
The place is trashed.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.482
[clattering]

17:30.440 --> 17:31.746
[whispers]
Cho.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.098
[intense music]

17:49.503 --> 17:50.895
[clank]

17:56.466 --> 17:58.164
[whispers]
I'm, I'm just gonna
wait on, on the jetty.

17:59.556 --> 18:00.905
Shh.

18:05.519 --> 18:08.087
Who are you?

18:08.174 --> 18:10.219
Patrick Jane, CBI.

18:13.962 --> 18:15.137
Don't shoot.

18:17.313 --> 18:18.836
[gun cocks]
What's that, CBI?

18:18.923 --> 18:21.578
- Police. Lay the gun down.
- Show me the badge.

18:21.665 --> 18:24.581
- Put the gun down!
- Okay, police.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.540
I make no trouble.
No problem.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.892
- Who'd you think we were?
- Nobody.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.807
Who are you?
What are you looking for?

18:32.894 --> 18:34.417
This is my boat.
I can do what I like.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.420
Yeah, it's very nice,
very put together.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.640
This boat belongs
to Jason Sands.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.251
Yes, and Jason Sands
is my fiance.

18:43.774 --> 18:46.212
[instrumental music]

18:53.610 --> 18:55.308
Adrianna,
we can charge you right now

18:55.395 --> 18:57.484
with burglary, vandalism,
assault with a deadly weapon.

18:57.571 --> 18:59.573
That's 10
to 15 right there.

18:59.660 --> 19:01.531
Wouldn't you rather talk to us
about your situation?

19:01.618 --> 19:03.272
From you, I buy cookies.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.927
I don't talk about situation.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.668
- Listen. We have enough--
- Shh.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.454
[intense music]

19:16.285 --> 19:17.243
[sighs]

19:17.330 --> 19:18.461
The handsome one.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.203
Gay, yes?

19:22.857 --> 19:25.294
This is
a murder investigation.

19:25.381 --> 19:28.123
You've got no alibi
for the time frame in question.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.256
We're looking at you
as a suspect.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.040
You should take this
a little more seriously.

19:33.346 --> 19:36.871
You know,
when I was this big

19:36.958 --> 19:41.136
I was in a detention camp
for two years.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.572
- You understand?
- I understand.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.183
No, you don't.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.534
That was serious.

19:47.621 --> 19:48.796
This, no.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.017
What do you do
for a living?

19:53.104 --> 19:56.499
I dance, model, acting.

19:56.586 --> 19:57.718
Is that a good living?

19:57.805 --> 19:59.067
What's good?

19:59.154 --> 20:01.417
How long were you
and Jason Sands lovers?

20:01.504 --> 20:04.594
Two years. We were--
We were more than lovers.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.944
We were engaged to be married.

20:07.031 --> 20:09.382
- He was already married.
- No, he was divorcing her.

20:09.469 --> 20:10.731
[Lisbon]
'She doesn't know that.'

20:10.818 --> 20:13.647
Oh, sure, she does.
Why would she tell you?

20:13.734 --> 20:15.823
It's embarrassing.
He doesn't want her anymore.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.913
- It is embarrassing.
- What were you looking for?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.306
And we loved each other.

20:20.393 --> 20:21.916
You loved each other.
We hear that.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.397
What were you looking for
on the boat?

20:24.484 --> 20:27.835
Jason bought
$10 million of diamonds

20:27.922 --> 20:29.880
for when we would run away.
I was looking for them.

20:30.881 --> 20:33.232
When did he buy them?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.930
A month ago.
Once he showed me them.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.020
They are beautiful.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.762
[chuckles]

20:41.849 --> 20:43.764
And then he hid them somewhere.
I don't know where.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.461
You were gonna run away?

20:45.548 --> 20:47.985
Jason knew that it was
the end of the road here.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.900
He was going to jail

20:49.987 --> 20:52.555
or going to get killed,
so we make a plan.

20:52.642 --> 20:55.428
We are going, to, uh,
run away in the sailboat.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.430
You and him,
on a sailboat.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.607
No, he was a good sailor.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.870
He teach me.

21:02.957 --> 21:07.396
If, um, those bastards
didn't kill him

21:07.483 --> 21:11.792
maybe me and him and Julie
would be in Tahiti

21:11.879 --> 21:14.795
rich, instead
of here with you.

21:14.882 --> 21:17.014
Y-you were
gonna take Julie?

21:17.101 --> 21:19.887
What bastards?
You know who killed him?

21:19.974 --> 21:21.976
- Yeah, sure, I know.
- Tell us.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.587
If I tell you,
I leave here now.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.242
You drop
this burglary stupidness.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.113
I don't testify. Nothing.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.640
I give you names.
That's it.

21:33.727 --> 21:35.946
Deal.

21:36.033 --> 21:40.647
These, um, scum pigs
run nightclubs.

21:40.734 --> 21:43.345
Jason cleans their, uh

21:43.432 --> 21:46.957
drug and, um,
girl money for them.

21:47.044 --> 21:49.873
It's this money he uses
to buy the diamonds.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.614
Did they have
a company called

21:51.701 --> 21:53.399
Happy Landings Entertainment
out of Oakland?

21:53.486 --> 21:56.053
I don't know.
They live in Oakland.

21:56.140 --> 21:57.490
These people have names?

21:59.622 --> 22:01.407
Dieter Webb
and Carter Lewis.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.235
Scum pigs.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.499
[whispers]
Scum pigs.

22:08.979 --> 22:11.504
[Cho]
'Dieter and Carter,
started out as college deejays.'

22:11.591 --> 22:14.028
Nightlife impresarios
is what they say they are.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.291
They own clubs, restaurants,
boutique hotels

22:16.378 --> 22:17.945
up and down
the west coast.

22:18.032 --> 22:19.816
Drugs and prostitution
started as a natural sideline

22:19.903 --> 22:20.861
then became
their core business.

22:20.948 --> 22:22.384
Did we find 'em?

22:22.471 --> 22:23.385
These guys like
to glide under the radar.

22:23.472 --> 22:24.778
According to official records

22:24.865 --> 22:26.823
they own no property
and live nowhere.

22:26.910 --> 22:29.217
Their only address
is a PO Box.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.437
Working with San Francisco
and Oakland PD as we speak.

22:31.524 --> 22:34.396
- You're letting her go?
- She gave us Dieter and Carter.

22:34.483 --> 22:37.051
I could charge her with waving
a gun at Jane, but what for?

22:37.138 --> 22:39.706
[Rigsby]
'I don't know, boss.
If ever I saw a woman'

22:39.793 --> 22:42.143
who could use pliers and a lit
cigar on a man, that's her.

22:42.230 --> 22:45.146
Miss. Jonovic, a moment.

22:45.233 --> 22:47.191
Jane, tell her
not to leave town.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.719
You said you and Jason

22:52.806 --> 22:53.850
were planning
on leaving with Julie.

22:53.937 --> 22:54.982
Yes.

22:55.069 --> 22:56.549
You didn't mind
taking the kid?

22:56.636 --> 22:58.899
No. I love Julie.
Me and her are good friends.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.596
You were gonna take her
away from her own mother?

23:00.683 --> 23:01.945
Yes.

23:02.032 --> 23:04.687
Oh, that seems
a cruel thing to do.

23:04.774 --> 23:08.474
Depends. She is
a cold person, Jennifer.

23:08.561 --> 23:11.477
She doesn't care so much
about Julie.

23:11.564 --> 23:15.350
She pretends,
but she doesn't really.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.787
Tell me something.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.877
Do you think, uh,
Jennifer has my diamonds?

23:20.964 --> 23:23.053
I don't know. Maybe.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.926
Maybe? Did you ask her?

23:31.061 --> 23:32.802
Don't leave town.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.064
As you like.

23:36.327 --> 23:39.374
- So love and affection, huh?
- That's it.

23:39.461 --> 23:40.984
Where you going?

23:41.071 --> 23:43.117
- To speak to the widow.
- Oh, yeah?

23:43.204 --> 23:44.945
I want to know if she knows
about the mistress.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.826
[whispers]
This is delicious.
Thank you so much.

24:02.963 --> 24:05.226
Do you
have children, Patrick?

24:05.313 --> 24:07.707
No.

24:07.794 --> 24:10.144
- They are the greatest gift.
- Yes, they are.

24:10.231 --> 24:11.928
Put a little bit
of ginger in it.

24:12.015 --> 24:14.409
Hey, it's been bothering
the hell of out of me.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.977
"Peter And The Wolf"..

24:17.064 --> 24:21.024
...is the duck a flute
or a bassoon? I cannot remember.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.897
Oh, um, a, a bassoon,
I think.

24:23.984 --> 24:25.594
Never mind. Trivia.

24:25.681 --> 24:29.685
Listen, I have good news,
and I have bad news.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.905
Dieter Webb's
grandmother is 93

24:31.992 --> 24:34.037
and lives in a seniors' assisted
living center in Tucson.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.431
- Has for a decade, but she--
- Let me guess.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.085
She's leasing
a high-end vehicle

24:38.172 --> 24:39.826
and recently bought
a nice house in Oakland.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.044
You're good.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.655
Get Rigsby
and Van Pelt on it.

24:44.787 --> 24:47.311
[Jennifer]
'$10 million?'

24:47.398 --> 24:51.315
Yes, just as you suspected,
a very healthy nest egg.

24:51.402 --> 24:53.666
Oh, that's wonderful.
We have to find it.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.450
Wouldn't be a bad idea.

24:55.537 --> 24:56.756
Where should we start?

24:59.062 --> 25:01.717
I don't know.

25:01.804 --> 25:04.067
You found the safe room
in a moment.

25:04.154 --> 25:07.201
You must be terribly clever
at that kind of thing..

25:07.288 --> 25:09.072
...finding things.

25:09.159 --> 25:11.074
I could try.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.163
But, Jennifer,
that was the good news.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.167
Okay.

25:17.254 --> 25:19.169
Bad news?

25:19.256 --> 25:22.259
We talked to a woman who appears
to have been Jason's mistress.

25:27.482 --> 25:30.093
I knew it.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.660
I knew it. I knew it.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.358
[Jane]
'I'm sorry.'

25:34.445 --> 25:36.404
You didn't know about her?

25:36.491 --> 25:40.408
No. What's she like?
H-how old is she?

25:40.495 --> 25:43.063
Mid '20s,
Eastern European, tough.

25:44.455 --> 25:45.587
[Jennifer]
'Good-looking?'

25:47.284 --> 25:48.459
Not bad.

25:50.374 --> 25:51.680
Does she have the money?

25:51.767 --> 25:52.899
Strong possibility.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.859
Life is so complicated.

26:02.343 --> 26:03.562
'Patrick?'

26:05.651 --> 26:06.695
Will you hold me?

26:08.175 --> 26:10.003
I need someone
to hold me. Please.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.183
I'm sorry, Jennifer.
I wish I could.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.927
[instrumental music]

26:32.591 --> 26:33.679
Where's the entry team?
They were supposed

26:33.766 --> 26:35.376
to be here 20 minutes ago.

26:35.463 --> 26:38.509
Relax. Guys like these probably
aren't even out of bed yet.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.686
Could be up
from the night before.

26:40.773 --> 26:42.775
Maybe went out
for some breakfast.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.603
We can deal with 'em.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.040
Suddenly she's Steve McQueen.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.999
[indistinct chattering]

26:50.086 --> 26:51.044
they'reon the move.

26:54.134 --> 26:55.614
[starts engine]
Come on. Let's take 'em.

26:57.050 --> 26:59.052
[engine starts]

27:02.664 --> 27:04.318
[siren blaring]

27:04.405 --> 27:06.189
[tires screeching]

27:06.276 --> 27:08.191
- Police! Get out of the car!
- Hands up!

27:08.278 --> 27:09.279
[Rigsby]
'Get out of the car!'

27:09.366 --> 27:10.629
- Get out!
- Whoa, whoa.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.109
Take it easy, man.
Come on.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.850
Nice and easy.
Up against the car.

27:17.287 --> 27:19.159
Up against the car.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.422
[children laughing]

27:21.509 --> 27:22.902
[female #1]
Ven aqui.

27:24.251 --> 27:25.382
Freeze!

27:26.949 --> 27:28.168
[Van Pelt]
'Hands behind your head.'

27:29.125 --> 27:31.562
[intense music]

27:42.791 --> 27:44.488
Uhh!

27:44.575 --> 27:46.752
[both grunting]

27:48.884 --> 27:50.581
[Rigsby]
'Hands.
Give me your hands!'

27:51.757 --> 27:53.672
Let's go.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.456
[grunting]

27:55.543 --> 27:56.849
[thud]

27:57.850 --> 28:00.287
Hi. Let's go. Let's go.

28:03.856 --> 28:06.989
[door opens]

28:07.076 --> 28:08.991
[Cho]
'You don't want
to talk to me, Dieter?'

28:09.078 --> 28:11.733
I've got nothing to say.
Call my lawyer.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.387
What do you know
about Jason Sands?

28:13.474 --> 28:14.475
I know he's dead.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.608
How much
did he take from you?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.480
How much what?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.395
We estimate he stole
around $10 million from you.

28:21.482 --> 28:22.875
Is that about right?

28:22.962 --> 28:25.094
Me and my partner,
we host parties.

28:25.181 --> 28:26.748
I'm doing good,
but not that good.

28:28.532 --> 28:29.925
$10 million.

28:32.493 --> 28:33.973
Jason didn't steal
anything from me.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.757
You and Carter
broke into his house

28:35.844 --> 28:37.454
and you tortured him to death
because he stole from you.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.456
Look, dude, I know people
that know how to do that stuff.

28:39.543 --> 28:42.068
You know what I'm saying?
If it was us that tortured him

28:42.155 --> 28:45.549
we'd have the money right now,
and he'd have his life.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.203
- I wouldn't kill him.
- What money?

28:49.379 --> 28:51.773
Oh, you caught me there.

28:51.860 --> 28:55.429
The imaginary money
you said he stole from us.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.083
'Somebody got there before us.'

28:57.170 --> 28:58.519
An imaginary somebody.

29:01.261 --> 29:03.480
You want my opinion?

29:03.567 --> 29:05.526
Now this isn't snitching.
It's just an opinion.

29:07.006 --> 29:10.792
Write this down.
Adrianna Jonovic.

29:10.879 --> 29:13.490
She's a crazy Armenian dancer
that Jason was tapping.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.929
- Why?
- She's a mercenary bitch.

29:17.016 --> 29:19.105
She made Jason's life misery
and made him like it.

29:20.671 --> 29:23.022
She used to work for us

29:23.109 --> 29:24.632
so I know whereof I speak.

29:26.503 --> 29:27.896
You should check her out.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.942
The other one, Lewis,
has the same line.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.295
There were class "A" drugs
all over his house

29:35.382 --> 29:37.036
so we can hold him
as long as it takes.

29:37.123 --> 29:38.298
And Jonovic?

29:38.385 --> 29:39.778
I think she's clean
on this one

29:39.865 --> 29:41.475
but we can bring her back
in just to be safe.

29:41.562 --> 29:43.129
Well, don't let up on 'em.
We need a result here.

29:43.216 --> 29:44.521
[cellphone ringing]

29:44.608 --> 29:46.088
- Mrs. Sands.
- Oh.

29:46.175 --> 29:49.004
Patrick, she's gone.
She's gone.

29:49.091 --> 29:51.746
Th-they-they took her!
My baby is gone!

29:51.833 --> 29:53.792
It's okay. It's okay.
W-we'll be right there.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.317
[intense music]

30:07.022 --> 30:08.415
So you think the guys
from Oakland are behind this?

30:08.502 --> 30:09.720
Just 'cause they're
in custody doesn't mean

30:09.808 --> 30:11.810
they couldn't
have arranged this.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.724
You said the men my husband
stole from are behind bars.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.117
They are.

30:15.204 --> 30:16.989
Then if they didn't
do this, who did?

30:17.076 --> 30:19.861
I assure you we're doing
everything we can to find Julie.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.994
The note left said
you knew what they wanted.

30:22.081 --> 30:25.171
The money, obviously.
We have to find the money.

30:25.258 --> 30:26.868
I have to give them
what they want.

30:26.955 --> 30:28.261
Why would they think
you have it?

30:28.348 --> 30:30.654
I don't--I-I don't know.

30:30.741 --> 30:34.267
- You have to find my baby.
- We're trying, Mrs. Sands.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.443
CBI is working in conjunction
with federal agents--

30:36.530 --> 30:38.619
look, I don't care
about any of that.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.839
Look, you have to find
my little girl. Please.

30:45.539 --> 30:47.149
What are you talking about,
steal a kid?

30:47.236 --> 30:48.803
I've been locked up
in this place.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.239
You have friends, remember?

30:50.326 --> 30:51.980
So you think
that I'd be ass enough

30:52.067 --> 30:54.548
to hire somebody to do it
while I'm in here?

30:58.247 --> 31:00.423
Dieter has a point.
He and Carter are bad guys

31:00.510 --> 31:01.772
but they're not mafia.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.296
'They don't have
that kind of reach.'

31:03.383 --> 31:07.126
- Or those kind of stones.
- We're up.

31:07.213 --> 31:08.867
The kidnappers just IM'ed
Jennifer's cell phone.

31:11.695 --> 31:14.481
Say yes. Say yes and tell 'em
I'll bring it to them.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.091
- What? No.
- It's okay.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.832
I know where the money is,
honestly. Say yes.

31:18.964 --> 31:21.575
[keyboard clicking]

31:25.971 --> 31:28.016
[thunder rumbling]

31:30.410 --> 31:33.543
- Still awake?
- Wide. Jane, be careful.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.850
Don't try and get them
to say anything or stop them.

31:35.937 --> 31:37.330
All we need is their phone.

31:37.417 --> 31:38.940
[Rigsby]
'Just sent us the number.'

31:39.027 --> 31:40.028
We'll track
the kidnapper's address.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.987
Oh, here comes someone.

31:42.074 --> 31:44.250
[Lisbon]
'Jane, just do your mind games'
and get out of there, okay?

31:44.337 --> 31:45.381
[beep]

31:45.468 --> 31:46.687
[Jane]
'Don't worry, mom.'

31:51.735 --> 31:53.650
[Adrianna]
'This better not be a trap.'

31:53.737 --> 31:55.435
I will kill you.
Give me the diamonds.

31:55.522 --> 31:58.612
Oh, Adrianna, you're going down
the wrong road. Kidnapping is--

31:58.699 --> 32:01.963
I'm not a kidnapper.
You think I want to do this?

32:02.050 --> 32:04.792
I have to do this.
I don't want Julie to die.

32:04.879 --> 32:07.403
Tell me what's going on.
I can, I can help you.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.536
I don't know you.
I don't trust you.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.713
Just give me the diamonds.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.932
Okay.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.415
Where's Julie?

32:19.502 --> 32:20.895
I call a number,
tell them

32:20.982 --> 32:22.897
I have the diamonds,
they give Julie.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.725
Call them.

32:24.812 --> 32:26.770
How do I know
those are real diamonds?

32:26.857 --> 32:27.946
They look real to me.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.560
[Jane]
'Here.'

32:33.647 --> 32:34.822
'Why don't you have a look?'

32:36.041 --> 32:37.651
You've seen them before.
Here.

32:38.913 --> 32:41.176
[intense music]

32:45.354 --> 32:46.573
Oh, I'm sorry.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.621
It's okay.

32:51.708 --> 32:52.796
[Lisbon]
'Scan's working.'

32:53.797 --> 32:54.973
[beep]

32:57.497 --> 32:59.455
[phone dialing]
No, this--this..

32:59.542 --> 33:02.197
- This is not the diamonds.
- No, plastic.

33:02.284 --> 33:03.851
Forwarding
the last number dialed.

33:03.938 --> 33:05.461
-Hey!
-Uh--

33:05.548 --> 33:09.900
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- You son of a whore.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.078
Signal on that phone is coming
from an apartment building

33:13.165 --> 33:14.557
in the presidio.
All units move in.

33:14.644 --> 33:17.169
- They will kill Julie now.
- Who is "they"?

33:17.256 --> 33:18.997
I don't know!

33:19.084 --> 33:22.304
They call me.
They send pictures to my phone

33:22.391 --> 33:24.263
of-of Julie tied up.

33:24.350 --> 33:27.570
They say I must give them
Jason's money, or she dies.

33:28.963 --> 33:30.791
I don't have Jason's money.

33:30.878 --> 33:33.315
Did they ask for Jason's money
or did they ask for diamonds?

33:33.402 --> 33:34.621
For money.

33:34.708 --> 33:36.275
Then they're not
gonna hurt Julie

33:36.362 --> 33:37.798
ifyou're telling me
the truth.

33:37.885 --> 33:40.670
No if.
I am telling the truth.

33:41.845 --> 33:44.152
[intense music]

33:55.120 --> 33:56.382
[cocks gun]

34:07.523 --> 34:08.655
Get back.

34:08.742 --> 34:10.570
- 'Police!'
- Police! Freeze!

34:10.657 --> 34:12.789
[indistinct chattering]

34:12.876 --> 34:14.356
- Drop the weapon!
- Drop the gun!

34:14.443 --> 34:15.792
- Drop the weapon!
- Put down the weapon!

34:15.879 --> 34:17.968
- 'Drop the weapon!'
- 'Drop the gun!'

34:18.056 --> 34:19.753
- Drop it right now!
- 'Put it down!'

34:19.840 --> 34:21.798
- 'Put down the weapon!'
- Watch the kid!

34:24.192 --> 34:26.107
[gunshots]

34:31.634 --> 34:32.374
[elevator bell ringing]

34:33.984 --> 34:36.030
[intense music]

34:38.598 --> 34:39.860
So far what I know is

34:39.947 --> 34:41.949
you guys shot
and grievously wounded

34:42.036 --> 34:43.951
a prominent
and a very well-liked member

34:44.038 --> 34:46.040
of the San Francisco bar.

34:46.127 --> 34:48.477
What's going on? In simple,
declarative sentences.

34:48.564 --> 34:50.392
Bennett's our man.
He killed Jason Sands

34:50.479 --> 34:52.090
for $10 million
in diamonds

34:52.177 --> 34:54.092
kidnapped Julie Sands
for the same reason.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.920
Either the widow or the mistress
acted as his accomplice.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.096
Which one?

34:58.183 --> 34:59.662
We're trying
to nail that down now.

34:59.749 --> 35:00.750
If Bennett makes it,
he could tell us

35:00.837 --> 35:02.274
but it doesn't look
like he will

35:02.361 --> 35:04.667
so we're gonna need a confession
from his accomplice.

35:04.754 --> 35:06.495
- So, um..
- What?

35:07.975 --> 35:10.804
Jane has an idea.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.588
But if we generate
any complaints

35:12.675 --> 35:14.938
as to how we go about this,
you've got our backs, right?

35:15.025 --> 35:17.419
Well, that depends.

35:17.506 --> 35:20.335
Obviously, we need a win here.
But I-I won't sanction

35:20.422 --> 35:21.989
anything underhanded
or actionable.

35:22.076 --> 35:23.295
That's kind of vague.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.774
The whole point
of this unit

35:24.861 --> 35:27.603
is, is subtly and discretion
and judgment.

35:27.690 --> 35:31.216
I expect youto do what's right
without dragging me into it.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.609
Really?

35:33.696 --> 35:34.828
[sighs]

35:34.915 --> 35:37.352
Yes, yes, Lisbon.

35:37.439 --> 35:41.400
Of course. If I'm forced to it,
I have your back.

35:41.487 --> 35:43.358
I'm insulted
you need to ask.

35:44.533 --> 35:47.188
[instrumental music]

35:51.758 --> 35:53.586
Where is she? Where is she?
Is she okay?

35:53.673 --> 35:56.676
Yes. She's a little in shock,
but physically she's fine.

35:56.763 --> 35:59.287
Not a scratch. Doctors
just want to make sure.

35:59.374 --> 36:00.506
Hello, Jennifer.

36:03.030 --> 36:06.164
Adrianna?
This is a surprise.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.516
What's she doing here?
Shouldn't she be in jail?

36:10.603 --> 36:12.213
Uh, out on bond, ma'am.

36:12.300 --> 36:13.649
So quickly?

36:13.736 --> 36:15.216
I screw better lawyers
than you.

36:19.089 --> 36:20.917
You've obviously led
a very sad

36:21.004 --> 36:23.659
and difficult life
to be so twisted.

36:23.746 --> 36:26.271
Truly, Adrianna,
you have my sympathy.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.316
[speaking in foreign language]

36:30.449 --> 36:32.842
- Cho, let's move.
- Oh, hey.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.888
- What was that name again?
- What name?

36:34.975 --> 36:36.933
The one that Jane thought
was so important.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.631
- 'Wendy.'
- Right, Wendy.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.328
Do either of you
know a woman named Wendy?

36:40.415 --> 36:42.461
- No.
- No? Shame.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.506
- She'd be worth knowing.
- 'Cho.'

36:44.593 --> 36:47.379
- What?
- Excuse his levity, ma'am.

36:47.466 --> 36:49.642
This Wendy person,
she has the diamonds?

36:49.729 --> 36:51.339
- It's a possibility.
- Diamonds?

36:51.426 --> 36:52.688
By the way, your friend

36:52.775 --> 36:54.690
Mr. Bennett is coming along
nicely. I expect

36:54.777 --> 36:56.518
we'll be talking to him shortly.
So if there's anything

36:56.605 --> 36:58.172
you want to pass along..

36:58.259 --> 37:00.218
But this other police
said that he was a dead man.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.610
Yeah, they said
he was dying.

37:01.697 --> 37:03.699
No. No, he'll live.

37:05.527 --> 37:08.356
[intense music]

37:12.969 --> 37:14.623
- How'd it go?
- I think we sold it.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.451
- Are you kidding? We killed.
- Yeah.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.018
Well, Jane says
give it a moment

37:18.105 --> 37:19.280
let it play itself out.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.155
[indistinct chattering]

37:27.157 --> 37:29.116
[beeps]

37:29.203 --> 37:31.510
It's empty.
They're both gone.

37:31.597 --> 37:32.815
Really? Both?

37:34.295 --> 37:35.862
Jane, nobody's there.
Come on.

37:36.819 --> 37:39.518
[intense music]

37:41.302 --> 37:43.522
It's okay, baby.
Everything going to be good now.

37:43.609 --> 37:45.219
Everything's good. Hmm?

37:45.306 --> 37:46.742
Where have you been?

37:46.829 --> 37:48.440
[Adrianna laughing]

37:48.527 --> 37:49.789
Mwah.

37:51.965 --> 37:54.794
[intense music]

37:58.145 --> 37:59.929
Damn! Damn!

38:00.016 --> 38:01.931
[grunts]
Damn!

38:02.018 --> 38:03.193
What are you looking for?

38:05.195 --> 38:06.327
[sighs]

38:06.414 --> 38:07.894
You know what
I'm looking for.

38:07.981 --> 38:10.853
I'm pretty certain Wendy Sands
had purple hair.

38:12.594 --> 38:14.117
You may want
to call a lawyer now.

38:14.204 --> 38:16.381
Why? What for?

38:16.468 --> 38:18.818
Don't make
this difficult, Jennifer.

38:18.905 --> 38:20.646
Bennett told us everything.

38:20.733 --> 38:21.908
Nicely done.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.652
You made me think
Adrianna had the money

38:26.739 --> 38:30.438
and you made her think
I had the money. Clever.

38:30.525 --> 38:32.266
Thank you.

38:32.353 --> 38:35.617
Coming from a fine actress
like yourself, I'm..

38:35.704 --> 38:38.185
...I'm flattered.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.491
Is it really in diamonds

38:39.578 --> 38:41.231
or is that just
part of the trick?

38:41.319 --> 38:43.146
No trick. Diamonds.

38:43.973 --> 38:45.714
Do you know where?

38:45.801 --> 38:48.413
- I do.
- Tell me.

38:48.500 --> 38:50.415
Tell me what happened

38:50.502 --> 38:52.286
and I'll tell you
where they are.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.506
This whole time,
you were just playing me.

38:56.072 --> 38:58.161
Not the whole time.

38:58.248 --> 39:00.381
That's so sad. I..

39:00.468 --> 39:02.383
...thought we had
a real connection.

39:02.470 --> 39:04.080
We did.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.561
- We can again.
- No, we can't.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.567
You know, I..

39:12.654 --> 39:14.134
...I never meant
for this to happen.

39:16.397 --> 39:19.182
I know.

39:19.269 --> 39:21.794
It was Bennett.

39:21.881 --> 39:24.362
He forced me into this.
He, he planned the whole thing.

39:24.449 --> 39:27.495
No, Bennett is an idiot
that thinks he's in control

39:27.582 --> 39:29.454
but you played him
like a violin

39:29.541 --> 39:32.282
with those big eyes
and those trembling lips.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.850
It's a dynamite act.
You had me buying it.

39:37.549 --> 39:40.508
If only you'd told me
the duck was an oboe

39:40.595 --> 39:43.424
I probably would've told you
where the diamonds were

39:43.511 --> 39:45.861
and we likely never
would've solved this one.

39:45.948 --> 39:47.689
The duck was an oboe?

39:47.776 --> 39:51.519
Yeah.
"Peter And The Wolf."

39:51.606 --> 39:53.347
The duck
is played by the oboe.

39:54.870 --> 39:57.438
The wolf is a bassoon.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.658
The flute is the songbird.

39:59.745 --> 40:00.920
Anyone who's seen it
knows that.

40:01.747 --> 40:04.489
But you didn't.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.012
'You didn't go
to "Peter And The Wolf."'

40:06.099 --> 40:08.667
you stayed home
and tortured your husband

40:08.754 --> 40:10.799
to make him give you
his running away money.

40:13.236 --> 40:15.587
Running away
with mydaughter

40:15.674 --> 40:17.632
and $10 million
and that dirty whore.

40:17.719 --> 40:21.331
And leave me with nothing?
I don't think so.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.682
How do you think it feels
that my daughter prefers

40:23.769 --> 40:26.424
her father's whore over me?

40:26.511 --> 40:29.078
That she loves her
more than her own mother?

40:29.165 --> 40:30.950
How do you think
that feels?

40:31.994 --> 40:33.169
I'm sure it hurts.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.174
[sniffles]

40:38.261 --> 40:41.395
I always knew there was
a safe in that room

40:41.482 --> 40:43.005
but he would never
tell me where

40:43.092 --> 40:45.225
or what the combination was.

40:45.312 --> 40:47.793
And I had
a real breakthrough insight.

40:48.968 --> 40:50.752
I realized..

40:50.839 --> 40:52.450
that was
our whole marriage..

40:53.538 --> 40:55.061
...withholding.

40:55.148 --> 40:56.758
Withholding,
always withholding.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.415
Whatever it was that
I needed most from Jason

41:01.502 --> 41:03.635
[voice breaks]
that's what
he refused to give me.

41:04.984 --> 41:07.682
[sirens blaring in distance]

41:11.817 --> 41:13.819
Tell me.

41:13.906 --> 41:15.995
Where are they?

41:16.082 --> 41:17.431
[whispers]
The diamonds.

41:21.740 --> 41:24.003
[chimes chiming]

41:24.090 --> 41:26.396
- Very nice room.
- My daddy made it for me.

41:29.225 --> 41:32.011
[instrumental music]

41:43.196 --> 41:45.285
[chuckles]

41:51.421 --> 41:53.467
When did you first suspect
it was her?

41:53.554 --> 41:55.251
Oh, I had an idea
at the funeral service.

41:55.338 --> 41:57.036
- No, you did not.
- I did. I did.

41:57.123 --> 41:59.560
She, uh, she was
looking way too good.

41:59.647 --> 42:01.780
No wife should glow
at her husband's funeral.

42:01.867 --> 42:04.522
So you made that bet with Rigsby
that you could seduce her

42:04.609 --> 42:06.654
with the deliberate intention
of snaring her?

42:06.741 --> 42:08.874
I wanted to win the bet,
too, and, uh..

42:11.964 --> 42:13.313
I couldn't.

42:15.228 --> 42:17.578
Just because I lost doesn't mean
you shouldn't take my advice.

42:17.665 --> 42:19.711
- Yeah, yeah, hush.
- I'm serious, man.

42:21.321 --> 42:22.540
[sighs]
Go for it.

42:27.240 --> 42:28.502
[sighs]

42:31.026 --> 42:32.201
What's he talking about?

42:34.290 --> 42:35.422
Nothing.

42:37.032 --> 42:39.774
[instrumental music]

42:55.660 --> 42:57.531
Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
