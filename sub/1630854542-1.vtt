WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:11.219
(lively music)

00:36.494 --> 00:39.414
(upbeat jazz music)

00:42.083 --> 00:43.793
- [Grandma Margaret] Wait.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.378
Lucy, what is it?

00:45.420 --> 00:46.796
What happened?

00:46.838 --> 00:48.882
- I, I, I can't
do it, Grandma.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.050
- What?

00:50.091 --> 00:51.801
- I'm not good
enough to be Clara.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.011
- Wait a minute.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.220
You got a callback.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.890
- That's just because
of who you are.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.683
- Who told you that?

00:58.725 --> 00:59.893
- One of the other girls.

00:59.934 --> 01:01.811
- Well, that is nonsense.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.688
You got here on
your own, okay?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.232
All right. All right.

01:08.276 --> 01:10.028
How long until your group?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.030
- They said about
an hour and a half.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.365
- Okay. Come on.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.824
I want to show you something.

01:14.866 --> 01:18.161
(gentle music)

01:18.203 --> 01:19.412
- [Lucy] What is all this?

01:19.454 --> 01:22.999
- This is all
Rockettes history.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.628
All of these ladies were
superstars; actually,

01:26.670 --> 01:27.796
they still are.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.089
But I want to tell
you something.

01:29.130 --> 01:32.217
I think that the biggest star

01:32.258 --> 01:34.761
in this whole
place will be you.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.055
(gentle music continues)

01:37.097 --> 01:39.766
- But I know how much
it would mean to you

01:39.808 --> 01:40.809
if I got to be Clara.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.394
- Oh.
- I just,

01:42.435 --> 01:45.855
I just don't want you to be
disappointed if I'm not
picked.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.108
- The only thing that
would really disappoint me

01:48.149 --> 01:50.151
is if you didn't try.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.529
One of the best things in life

01:52.570 --> 01:55.865
comes when you're really
scared to do something

01:55.907 --> 01:57.283
but you do it anyway.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.452
- Were you scared
when you auditioned?

01:59.494 --> 02:01.121
- No.

02:01.162 --> 02:05.208
But boy, when they said
yes, I was terrified.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.876
But of course then I, uh,

02:07.836 --> 02:10.088
I had a lot more to lose.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.464
You know what?

02:11.506 --> 02:13.425
I think that you're
old enough now

02:13.466 --> 02:15.844
to hear the entire story.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.555
(dreamy music)

02:21.766 --> 02:24.436
(lively music)

02:28.106 --> 02:29.983
While my family was
busy getting ready

02:30.025 --> 02:34.279
to host the most
lavish Thanksgiving
dinner in Philadelphia,

02:35.405 --> 02:39.576
I turned on the TV and
what I saw changed my life.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.996
It was the first year that
the Rockettes ever performed

02:43.038 --> 02:43.997
at the parade,

02:44.039 --> 02:47.584
and I was absolutely
mesmerized.

02:47.625 --> 02:51.588
I wished so badly that
I could be one of them.

02:51.629 --> 02:54.174
I knew my family
would never approve.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.467
- [Lucy] Why not?

02:55.508 --> 02:56.718
- [Grandma Margaret] Well,

02:56.760 --> 02:58.970
my future was already
all mapped out for me,

03:00.263 --> 03:03.683
and it had nothing
to do with dancing.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.353
(gentle music)

03:08.063 --> 03:09.564
- Is that real gold, Mother?

03:09.606 --> 03:11.816
- Oh, don't be
ridiculous, Margaret.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.193
It's gold leaf.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.153
- Perhaps we should just
dip the entire invitation

03:15.195 --> 03:16.946
into diamond dust.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.656
- Oh, is that an option?

03:18.698 --> 03:19.324
(Margaret chuckles)

03:19.366 --> 03:21.326
- I wasn't serious.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.869
- Well, I am serious.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.037
You're our only child,

03:24.079 --> 03:25.622
and we are doing
this to the nines.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.290
- I'm sure you could
just do it to the sixes

03:27.332 --> 03:29.292
and be perfectly fine.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.002
- What's Maxwell's
middle name?

03:31.044 --> 03:33.004
- I haven't the
faintest idea, Mother.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.050
I also don't know
his favorite book,

03:37.092 --> 03:39.844
color, food,

03:39.886 --> 03:40.887
what inspires him,

03:40.929 --> 03:42.055
what brings him joy.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.723
- You'll learn all
of that in time.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.892
- Shouldn't I already know
the man I'm marrying in April?

03:45.934 --> 03:49.771
- All you need to know is
that Maxwell is a good man

03:49.813 --> 03:53.525
and he comes from a wonderful
Philadelphia family.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.903
Everyone agrees it's
a perfect match.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.114
Good morning, dear.

03:59.155 --> 04:01.783
- As soon as Maxwell
arrives, we'll start brunch.

04:01.825 --> 04:02.534
Oh, there he is!

04:02.575 --> 04:04.828
- Hello, my darling.

04:04.869 --> 04:06.538
(Margaret chuckles)

04:06.579 --> 04:08.456
You look stunning
today as always.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.624
(Elisabeth chuckles)

04:09.666 --> 04:10.959
How are the wedding
plans coming along?

04:11.001 --> 04:12.377
- Swimmingly.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.671
- Is that gold leaf.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.256
Very nice.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.299
My parents send the
regards, by the way.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.927
Father has a polo match at
Brandywine this afternoon.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.137
- Oh.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.430
We really should go
and see him play.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.432
Wouldn't that be a
fine time, Margaret?

04:25.807 --> 04:28.727
- Maxwell, can I
ask you a question?

04:28.768 --> 04:29.561
- Of course.

04:29.602 --> 04:31.354
- What brings you true joy?

04:31.396 --> 04:33.106
What really makes you happy?

04:33.148 --> 04:34.232
- Margaret,

04:34.274 --> 04:35.483
we were talking about polo.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.027
- How about polo then?

04:37.068 --> 04:38.486
Does polo make you happy?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.822
- You make me happy.

04:40.864 --> 04:41.906
- Thank you.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.992
That's very nice.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.953
What's my middle name?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.581
(whimsical music)

04:49.622 --> 04:50.749
- Maury?

04:50.790 --> 04:51.583
Mary.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.169
- It's Marie.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.921
- Ah, as in Antoinette.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.342
- Maxwell, you must tell us
about your father's new horse.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.303
Didn't you pick it up
at the Devon Horse Show

05:03.345 --> 05:04.721
over the summer?

05:04.763 --> 05:06.139
- [Maxwell] Yes, we did.
- A five, six, seven and eight

05:06.181 --> 05:08.725
A one and a two, a three,
a four, a five and a six,

05:08.767 --> 05:09.434
a seven and eight.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.061
A one, two, three, four,

05:11.102 --> 05:12.687
a five, a six, a
seven and eight.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.147
A one and a two, and a three,

05:14.189 --> 05:16.274
a four, five,
six, seven, eight.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.942
One, two, a three, a four,

05:17.984 --> 05:19.986
five, six, seven, eight.

05:20.028 --> 05:21.821
Oh, bravo, ladies!

05:21.863 --> 05:23.156
Bravo!

05:23.198 --> 05:26.284
Margaret, you were in
fantastic form as always.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.160
- Thank you.

05:27.202 --> 05:28.703
- Oh, before go,

05:28.745 --> 05:30.455
I want to tell you about an
exciting last-minute audition

05:30.497 --> 05:31.456
this afternoon.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.709
(suspenseful music)

05:44.636 --> 05:45.804
- Come on.

05:45.845 --> 05:46.513
The Rockettes are all
you've talked about

05:46.554 --> 05:48.014
since last Thanksgiving.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.599
- And if I get
cast, then what?

05:49.641 --> 05:51.976
I move to New York
for two months?

05:52.018 --> 05:53.228
It's preposterous.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.938
- Well, I'm definitely
not going to get cast.

05:54.979 --> 05:57.232
But it's a great way to
get audition experience.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.567
And I don't want
to go on my own.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.695
Just come with me, please.

06:01.736 --> 06:02.654
- Okay.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.198
For curiosity's sake, I'll go.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.535
(lively swing music)

06:17.794 --> 06:23.049
- Number 32, number
154, thank you.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.177
Congratulations,
Margaret Bennett.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.347
We've been searching for three
new dancers for this season,

06:29.389 --> 06:31.599
and you got the last spot.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.935
(suspenseful music)

06:33.977 --> 06:35.562
See you November 1st.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.565
- Was that a blast or what?

06:38.606 --> 06:39.733
Now you know you
were good enough

06:39.774 --> 06:41.735
even though you
can't actually do it.

06:41.776 --> 06:43.236
Can you imagine
leaving Philadelphia

06:43.278 --> 06:45.405
in the middle of planning
the biggest Main Line wedding

06:45.447 --> 06:46.906
in years?

06:46.948 --> 06:49.159
Not to mention the fact your
family would never allow it.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.663
You are going to tell
them no, aren't you?

06:55.915 --> 06:58.585
(gentle music)

07:02.005 --> 07:02.964
- Margaret,

07:04.549 --> 07:05.800
where have you been?

07:05.842 --> 07:08.303
I thought your class
ended hours ago.

07:08.345 --> 07:09.554
- I've been thinking
about the wedding

07:09.596 --> 07:11.139
and how I still haven't
found the perfect dress,

07:11.181 --> 07:12.307
so I went to the bridal salon

07:12.349 --> 07:14.184
to see if they
had anything new.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.268
- And did they?

07:15.310 --> 07:16.186
- Nothing at all.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.937
So I was thinking,

07:17.979 --> 07:21.274
why don't I go to New York and
meet with Gabriella Monroe?

07:21.316 --> 07:22.609
- Margaret,

07:22.650 --> 07:23.818
I have tried every
connection I have in the city

07:23.860 --> 07:24.944
to get an
appointment with her.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.571
She is booked
through the summer.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.531
- Well, I have
another connection.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.949
- You do? Who?

07:29.991 --> 07:32.660
- Remember my friend Kitty
from summer camp in Maine?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.079
She's Gabriella's niece.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.332
Well, she said her aunt
could see me on November 1st.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.667
(Elisabeth gasps)

07:38.708 --> 07:39.876
- That's wonderful.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.461
Oh, and of course
I'll go with you.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.129
- No.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.297
I'd like to go on my own.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.715
- No, I'm not comfortable

07:45.757 --> 07:47.550
with you being in the city
by yourself, young lady.

07:47.592 --> 07:48.968
- I'll stay with Kitty.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.638
Her husband just bought a
penthouse on Central Park.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.141
- Oh, she married well.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.102
She must be on cloud nine.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.145
- I'm sure she is.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.525
(lively swing music)

08:05.694 --> 08:07.445
- [Kitty] Margaret,
you're here!

08:07.487 --> 08:08.530
- Kitty!

08:09.823 --> 08:10.865
- Oh!

08:10.907 --> 08:12.909
- Are you sure you're
okay with this?

08:12.951 --> 08:14.119
- Of course.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.453
This is just like "It
Happened One Night."

08:15.495 --> 08:16.663
You're like Claudette Colbert,

08:16.705 --> 08:18.081
running away from
her wealthy family

08:18.123 --> 08:19.165
to follow her dream.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.375
- I'm not running away.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.794
I'm having one last
pre-wedding adventure

08:22.836 --> 08:25.088
that no one in my family
can ever know about.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.383
Ooh, I should probably
get to my new apartment.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.843
- You're not even
staying with me?

08:29.884 --> 08:31.594
- The Rockettes have us
in an all women's building

08:31.636 --> 08:33.471
at West 52nd and 8th,

08:33.513 --> 08:35.890
just a few blocks
from Radio City.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.058
- How brave?

08:37.100 --> 08:38.226
- What do you mean?

08:38.268 --> 08:41.312
- I just mean it's a
different lifestyle

08:41.354 --> 08:42.647
than you're used to.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.400
- Oh, I'm sure it's lovely.

08:45.442 --> 08:48.403
So that's just south
of here, right?

08:48.445 --> 08:49.654
Is it walking distance?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.322
- Not, not with
all that luggage.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.407
Let's get you a cab.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.324
- Oh.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.578
(lively jazz music)

08:57.412 --> 08:59.456
- Remember, if my
parents or Maxwell call-

08:59.497 --> 09:00.373
- I'll tell them
they can reach you

09:00.415 --> 09:01.416
at Radio City Music Hall.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.417
- Kitty!

09:02.459 --> 09:03.668
- Don't worry, Margaret.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.337
I'll tell them you're
wedding shopping,

09:05.378 --> 09:07.130
which we will do
together, won't we?

09:07.172 --> 09:08.089
- Of course.

09:11.926 --> 09:12.802
- Now, Lillian,

09:12.844 --> 09:14.054
this year please
try to remember,

09:14.095 --> 09:16.056
the 10 o'clock curfew
is not a suggestion,

09:16.097 --> 09:16.890
it's a rule.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.266
A young woman can't be seen

09:18.308 --> 09:20.602
gallivanting around town
at all hours, understood?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.103
- Of course, Rose.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.647
(Rose sighs)

09:24.689 --> 09:26.232
- You, boys, you're loitering.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.150
Go on now.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.068
Shoo! Shoo!

09:41.748 --> 09:43.249
- Could you possibly take
those up to my room for me?

09:43.291 --> 09:46.127
Uh, they're quite heavy and
I'm on the fourth floor.

09:49.130 --> 09:52.175
(lively percussion music)

09:52.217 --> 09:55.303
Ooh, I'll just wait for
the doorman, I suppose.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.682
(lively percussion
music continues)

09:58.723 --> 09:59.849
Oh!
- Hey!

09:59.891 --> 10:01.434
Is that a handbag
or a Billy club?

10:01.476 --> 10:02.310
- I'm terribly sorry,

10:02.352 --> 10:03.478
I didn't see you there.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.854
Are you hurt?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.189
- It takes a lot more than
a weaponized accessory

10:06.231 --> 10:07.232
to hurt a Navy man.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.485
- I'm curious.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.320
Why does the Navy have you
taking pictures of a lamppost?

10:12.362 --> 10:13.655
- I'm on leave.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.282
And if you really
want to know,

10:16.324 --> 10:18.743
I'm taking a shot of the
tinsel on the streetlight.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.286
The little bit there.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.038
I saw it and thought about how
it's probably been up there

10:22.080 --> 10:23.456
the entire year,

10:23.498 --> 10:24.708
just hanging on for dear life,

10:24.749 --> 10:25.750
waiting for the
rest of its friends

10:25.792 --> 10:27.127
to come back for Christmas.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.795
- I think my thought
would've been,

10:28.837 --> 10:31.923
"Someone didn't do a very good
job cleaning up in January."

10:31.965 --> 10:34.676
- Well, I guess it just
depends on how you look at
things.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.428
Can I help you with those?

10:36.469 --> 10:37.429
- Oh, no.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.513
I'm just waiting
for the doorman.

10:38.555 --> 10:39.973
- We don't have doormen

10:40.015 --> 10:43.143
or any men in this
building, for that matter.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.354
Of course you'll find
more than a few gentlemen

10:46.396 --> 10:47.772
happen upon this
apartment building

10:47.814 --> 10:48.857
looking for romance.

10:48.898 --> 10:49.941
- Oh.

10:49.983 --> 10:50.859
Not interested, thank you.
- I really

10:50.900 --> 10:51.985
was just taking pictures.

10:52.027 --> 10:52.819
- Is that so?

10:52.861 --> 10:54.029
- I'm a photographer, ma'am.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.655
- I thought you said
you were in the Navy.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.615
- Oh, the Navy
has photographers.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.201
I take pictures all around
the ship, the bases,

11:00.243 --> 11:01.411
everywhere the Navy goes.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.538
- There are no ships
on West 52nd, sailor.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.414
Move on!

11:04.456 --> 11:05.498
(John chuckles)

11:05.540 --> 11:07.250
- Have a nice day, ma'am.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.168
Miss.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.254
- I'm Rose, the
apartment manager.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.506
- Margaret Bennett, I'm new.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.592
- No kidding, Maggie.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.510
I'll help with your bags.

11:17.552 --> 11:20.430
(whimsical music)

11:27.562 --> 11:28.438
- Hi.

11:31.107 --> 11:31.983
Excuse me.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.861
- [Rose] What do you think?

11:34.903 --> 11:36.863
- This will do just fine.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.616
* Santa baby, got
a gift for me *

11:39.657 --> 11:41.659
But it isn't very
private, is it?

11:41.701 --> 11:45.121
- No, because this
is the common room.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.247
This is your room.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.127
- I don't get my own room.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.880
I could pay extra.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.132
How much more would
that be weekly? I...

11:57.342 --> 12:00.053
Oh, I spent most of my cash in
the dining car on the train.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.430
There was the most
gorgeous shrimp cocktail.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.725
Anyway, I'm sure we
could work something out.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.103
- Oh, it's nothing to do
with the money, dear.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.522
First years are at the
bottom of the wait list.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.565
- Oh.
- Good luck, dear.

12:12.607 --> 12:16.111
(whimsical jazzy music)

12:26.162 --> 12:27.622
- What am I doing?

12:27.664 --> 12:30.083
- You're helping me decorate
for Christmas, that's what.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.459
- But it's not even
Thanksgiving yet.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.669
- Oh, what can I say?

12:32.711 --> 12:33.753
I'm festive.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.797
Here, sit over there.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.551
I'm Sofia Gagliardi,
by the way.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.804
And one thing you should know
about me is I talk a lot.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.431
So if we're going
to be friends,

12:44.472 --> 12:46.224
you got to tell me if
I'm talking too much

12:46.266 --> 12:48.351
or else I'll just keep talking
and talking and talking.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.561
And I'm doing it right now,

12:49.602 --> 12:50.937
and I can't believe you
didn't say anything.

12:50.979 --> 12:52.605
(Margaret laughing)

12:52.647 --> 12:54.149
- I'm sorry.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.066
I'm Marg...

12:56.067 --> 12:59.237
Maggie Bennett
from Philadelphia.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.196
- Love Philly.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.657
Oh, Liberty Bell,
cheese steaks,

13:02.699 --> 13:03.616
Ben Franklin.

13:03.658 --> 13:04.576
Am I forgetting anything?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.286
- No, that's pretty much it.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.120
Where are you from?

13:07.162 --> 13:08.079
- Bensonhurst.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.165
Brooklyn.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.959
I changed my mind,
I'll finish this later.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.210
You got to change clothes.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.962
We got to be at Radio
City in 20 minutes,

13:16.004 --> 13:16.921
and you're wearing a dress

13:16.963 --> 13:18.048
like we're going
to the theater

13:18.089 --> 13:19.382
instead of going
to the theater,

13:19.424 --> 13:20.842
if you know what I mean.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.595
Wow, that's some
nifty luggage.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.305
- Oh, they're just
hand-me-downs.

13:25.347 --> 13:26.639
- From who? Grace Kelly?

13:26.681 --> 13:27.640
(Margaret chuckles)

13:27.682 --> 13:29.517
So what bag's your pants in?

13:29.559 --> 13:33.104
- Oh, I don't usually wear
pants when I'm going out.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.647
- Again, you're not going out.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.358
You're walking to work.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.319
You can borrow a pair from me.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.488
(whimsical music)

13:41.529 --> 13:42.489
There you go.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.365
- Thank you.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.032
- And that.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.492
Just go back there.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.827
(whimsical music continues)

13:47.869 --> 13:49.662
(Sofia sighs)

13:49.704 --> 13:51.039
Chicken parm.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.290
My cousin brought it over

13:52.332 --> 13:53.917
from his restaurant
on Mulberry Street.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.293
- It's 10 in the morning.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.296
- We rehearse six hours
a day, six days a week.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.383
And then we do two shows a
day for a month straight.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.927
That's a thousand high
kicks a day, Maggie.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.012
You never know when you might
need a late night snack.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.014
- Isn't there a dining
room downstairs?

14:08.056 --> 14:10.558
- There is, but it's
always good to have backup.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.561
That's better.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.314
- Oh good.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.565
You two met.

14:17.607 --> 14:18.858
You must be Margaret.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.110
- Maggie's fine.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.320
- I'm Alice, resident
advisor for the rookies.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.322
Any problems, any
questions, you come to me.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.740
I'm right here on
the fourth floor.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.701
- How many years have
you been a Rockette?

14:27.742 --> 14:29.369
- This is my 10th year.

14:29.411 --> 14:31.121
- Wow, I hope I
can last that long.

14:31.162 --> 14:33.873
- Oh, I'd do it
forever if I could.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.543
So we are missing
one girl. Janet.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.711
She's in 4C.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.379
- Oh, let's go say hello.

14:39.421 --> 14:40.046
Come on.

14:40.088 --> 14:43.049
(whimsical music)

14:46.136 --> 14:47.804
- Want to come
spruce up our room?

14:47.846 --> 14:49.723
- Not particularly.

14:49.764 --> 14:50.724
- Righto. Moving on.

14:50.765 --> 14:51.850
I'm Sofia, this is Maggie.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.018
I'm a bit of a talker, so you-

14:53.059 --> 14:54.853
- I'm going to stop
you right there.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.479
No need to trade life stories.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.273
- Suit yourself.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.774
How come she gets
her own room?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.568
- There are three new
girls and two rooms.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.153
The early bird
catches the worm.

15:03.194 --> 15:05.321
- For the record, I believe
I got here before you did.

15:05.363 --> 15:06.698
- Did you?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.366
I'm sure I would
have heard you.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.744
- So, Janet, where
are you from.

15:10.785 --> 15:11.619
(Janet sighs)

15:11.661 --> 15:12.829
- Cleveland.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.289
Again, don't take
this the wrong way,

15:14.330 --> 15:15.957
but I'm not here
to make friends.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.375
- Is there a right
way to take that?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.169
- I'm here to make
a name for myself.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.921
First stop, Rockettes;
next stop, Broadway.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.590
- You're going to want
to make friends, Janet.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.051
It's one of the best parts
about being a Rockette.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.719
We take care of each other.

15:27.761 --> 15:28.720
We're like sisters.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.929
- I already have
three sisters,

15:29.971 --> 15:31.723
I don't need anymore.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.725
- Well, I think
it's wonderful.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.560
I've always wanted a sister.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.604
How about you, Sofia?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.105
- You know, we should split.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.358
We don't want to be late for
our first rehearsal, right?

15:43.693 --> 15:46.363
(gentle music)

15:53.953 --> 15:55.163
- Where is everybody?

16:00.669 --> 16:03.380
(dreamy music)

16:11.012 --> 16:12.180
- There you are.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.973
You were supposed to
come through the back.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.684
Come this way.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.479
We'll just go through here.

16:19.521 --> 16:20.647
Don't be nervous.

16:21.564 --> 16:25.068
(dreamy music continues)

16:41.668 --> 16:44.004
- [Mr. Matthews] Okay. Today's
going to be an exciting day.

16:44.045 --> 16:47.298
(lively jazzy music)

16:48.925 --> 16:50.176
- Hi, I'm Lillian.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.012
Welcome to the Rockettes.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.138
- I'm Peggy.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.848
And we were all in
your shoes once.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.642
- And there are
a lot of shoes.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.769
- So many shoes.

16:59.811 --> 17:00.645
- But don't worry.

17:00.687 --> 17:01.646
After your first season,

17:01.688 --> 17:02.856
they'll be
completely broken in.

17:02.897 --> 17:03.982
- The shoes or us?

17:04.024 --> 17:06.568
- [Both] Both. (laughing)

17:06.609 --> 17:07.777
- All right, ladies.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.196
Let's shake some of
that rust off, shall we?

17:10.238 --> 17:11.865
Basic eye-high kick line

17:11.906 --> 17:14.242
starting on your
stage right angle.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.244
And a five, six, seven, eight.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.038
A one, two, three, four,

17:18.079 --> 17:19.622
five, six seven, eight.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.124
A one, two.

17:21.166 --> 17:24.586
Remember, your toe to your eye

17:24.627 --> 17:27.213
every single time.

17:27.255 --> 17:28.673
Six, seven, eight.

17:28.715 --> 17:29.507
That's it.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.884
Effortless.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.385
Yes.

17:32.427 --> 17:33.845
(dreamy music)

17:33.887 --> 17:38.308
You'll be right there
alongside them soon enough.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.852
Come on, we got to get
you up to wardrobe, hmm?

17:41.770 --> 17:43.897
(Margaret chuckles)

17:43.938 --> 17:45.315
- These are wonderful

17:46.107 --> 17:47.400
and heavy.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.277
- [Lucy] Are you
okay, Grandma?

17:49.319 --> 17:50.195
- Mm.

17:51.529 --> 17:54.074
I don't think it really
hit me until that moment.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.077
I was a Rockette. (chuckles)

17:57.118 --> 17:59.204
And a split second later,

17:59.245 --> 18:01.289
we were more
nervous than before.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.668
Thank goodness we had Alice.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.419
- It's okay, ladies.

18:06.461 --> 18:09.923
Drink a lot of
water, stay focused;

18:09.964 --> 18:13.176
and most importantly,
have a ball.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.344
(all chuckle)

18:14.386 --> 18:16.930
You get to dance with
your best friends.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.098
Day in and day out,

18:18.139 --> 18:19.641
we're here for each other.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.104
That's what makes
what we do so special.

18:24.145 --> 18:25.313
- All right.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.357
Remember your spacing.

18:28.983 --> 18:31.111
A one, two, three, four,

18:31.152 --> 18:33.196
five, six, seven and eight.

18:33.238 --> 18:35.240
Then one, two, three, four,

18:35.281 --> 18:37.617
five, six, seven, eight.

18:37.659 --> 18:38.368
Again.

18:38.410 --> 18:40.787
A one, two, three, four,

18:40.829 --> 18:42.956
five, six, seven, eight.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.958
One, two, three, four,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.002
five, six, seven, eight.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.628
You can do better.

18:48.670 --> 18:49.963
Again.

18:50.005 --> 18:53.591
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven and eight.

18:53.633 --> 18:58.680
A one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

18:58.722 --> 18:59.681
Almost.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.016
One more time.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.769
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven and eight.

19:04.811 --> 19:09.816
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

19:09.858 --> 19:10.984
That's it!

19:11.026 --> 19:14.696
Now, let's do that
100 more times.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.114
(Rockettes laughing)

19:16.156 --> 19:18.992
Hey, I'm going easy on you
since it's your first day.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.368
- That was going easy on us?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.162
- Oh, I can't walk anymore.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.789
I need a rest or a sandwich.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.250
I know a good market a couple
blocks down with a deli.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.585
- A couple blocks?

19:28.626 --> 19:29.294
- Oh, come on.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.004
We can do it. (chuckles)

19:31.046 --> 19:34.215
(lively swing music)

19:35.175 --> 19:37.260
- I'm telling you,
Harriet, it's too early.

19:37.302 --> 19:38.511
- Oh, Robert,

19:38.553 --> 19:40.347
it's never too early to
decorate for Christmas.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.182
- I think you'd put up
decorations in August

19:42.223 --> 19:43.058
if I said yes.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.019
(Harriet laughing)

19:46.061 --> 19:48.188
Hey, knock it off.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.023
We're not paying you
to take pictures.

19:50.065 --> 19:50.940
(John chuckles)

19:50.982 --> 19:52.275
- You're not paying me at all.

19:52.317 --> 19:53.610
- Is that why you haven't
been to the barber?

19:53.651 --> 19:55.862
- It's called paying
your dues, son.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.197
I did it, you are doing it,

19:57.238 --> 19:59.115
and someday your
kids will too.

19:59.157 --> 20:00.283
- First he'd ave
to find a girl

20:00.325 --> 20:01.534
he loves more
than that camera.

20:01.576 --> 20:02.494
- Can it, Cuz.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.412
- Just calling
it like I see it.

20:05.747 --> 20:06.873
- Ha! Hello, ladies.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.458
Is there something
we can help you with?

20:08.500 --> 20:10.210
- We're just here to
pick up some sandwiches.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.086
- Oh, careful,

20:11.127 --> 20:12.087
that one's got a handbag

20:12.128 --> 20:12.962
and she's not
afraid to use it.

20:13.004 --> 20:14.756
- Oh, it's you?

20:14.798 --> 20:16.383
- It is indeed I,

20:18.426 --> 20:19.094
me.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.053
- You know each other?

20:20.095 --> 20:21.429
- Unofficially.

20:21.471 --> 20:22.305
- Then let's fix that.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.890
I, I'm John.

20:23.932 --> 20:25.642
(whimsical music)

20:25.684 --> 20:26.476
And?

20:27.727 --> 20:28.728
And, and you are?

20:29.854 --> 20:31.356
- I'm going to get some fruit.

20:31.398 --> 20:35.318
(whimsical music continues)

20:38.613 --> 20:40.365
- Uh, can I help
you find anything?

20:40.407 --> 20:42.117
- Just the
aforementioned fruit.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.077
- Yeah.
- There it is.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.246
- Uh, the Jonagold
apples are new.

20:46.287 --> 20:50.250
Perfect for hot cider or
cold, uh, your choice.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.418
- Duly noted.

20:52.836 --> 20:55.463
- Uh, just to clarify,
this is my parents' store.

20:55.505 --> 20:57.465
I, I, I work here. (chuckles)

20:57.507 --> 20:58.883
I'm not just
following you around

20:58.925 --> 21:02.387
trying to show off my
knowledge of seasonal produce.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.431
- And what about
Navy photographer?

21:04.472 --> 21:06.474
- Oh, oh, that
too, until July.

21:06.516 --> 21:09.227
- And then a career in
high pressure fruit sales?

21:09.269 --> 21:10.103
(John chuckles)

21:10.145 --> 21:11.396
- And then, uh,

21:13.189 --> 21:14.357
I'm thinking of
applying to NYU

21:14.399 --> 21:16.651
to get a visual arts degree

21:17.610 --> 21:20.530
and then start a career
as a photojournalist.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.283
- Well, I think that's
a wonderful idea.

21:23.324 --> 21:24.659
NYU is a great-

21:24.701 --> 21:26.411
- Anyway, if you have
any more questions

21:26.453 --> 21:28.038
about apples or anything else,

21:29.748 --> 21:31.124
I'm your guy.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.001
- I'll keep that in mind.

21:33.043 --> 21:35.795
(gentle music)

21:35.837 --> 21:37.630
- I think I just might
need a sandwich every day

21:37.672 --> 21:40.091
if it means looking in
those please eyes again.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.801
- I thought his
eyes were brown.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.178
- I was talking about
the guy in a deli.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.054
Who did you think I meant?

21:44.095 --> 21:45.388
- Oh, no one.

21:46.890 --> 21:47.640
Don't look at me like that.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.267
I'm spoken for back home.

21:49.309 --> 21:50.977
- It took you an entire
day to mention that?

21:51.019 --> 21:52.145
- I'm just here to dance,

21:52.187 --> 21:53.188
let's focus on that.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.857
(lively music)

21:55.899 --> 21:57.192
- We're still waiting!

21:57.233 --> 21:58.068
- Hello?

21:58.109 --> 21:59.986
- We're still out here!

22:00.028 --> 22:01.571
- That's it, I'm going in.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.198
- Woo! Oh!

22:03.239 --> 22:05.784
(lively music continues)

22:05.825 --> 22:06.868
Oh.

22:06.910 --> 22:09.120
I didn't realize
anyone was waiting.

22:10.372 --> 22:11.331
- Woo! Oh!

22:11.373 --> 22:13.917
(lively music continues)

22:13.958 --> 22:16.294
You used all the hot water!

22:16.336 --> 22:17.879
- You can run
out of hot water?

22:17.921 --> 22:20.715
(dramatic music)

22:46.449 --> 22:48.410
(alarm rings)

22:55.625 --> 22:59.004
- Make sure your heads
are back on count five.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.672
And just feel the fabric.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.924
Don't hold onto
each other, hmm?

23:06.094 --> 23:08.346
(alarm rings)

23:08.388 --> 23:11.057
(upbeat swing music continues)

23:17.480 --> 23:20.066
You have exactly 78 seconds

23:20.108 --> 23:24.571
to change from "Wooden
Soldier" costume to "Times
Square,"

23:24.612 --> 23:26.573
and that is the transition

23:26.614 --> 23:30.076
that we are going to work
on for the rest of the day.

23:30.118 --> 23:31.828
Positions.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.455
And go.

23:34.998 --> 23:38.126
(footsteps clomping)

23:42.130 --> 23:43.715
- All right, ladies.

23:43.757 --> 23:44.591
All right.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.135
Right gloves.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.263
Zippers.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.139
I got you.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.891
Janet!

23:52.932 --> 23:54.059
Janet!

23:54.100 --> 23:57.979
(upbeat swing music continues)

24:00.398 --> 24:02.067
- Five seconds!

24:07.322 --> 24:08.782
Well, (chuckles)

24:08.823 --> 24:10.575
almost all of you made it.

24:10.617 --> 24:12.786
Now, just try it
without looking

24:12.827 --> 24:15.622
like you were run over
by Santa's sleigh.

24:15.663 --> 24:18.958
(Rockettes laughing)

24:22.087 --> 24:24.381
- [Elisabeth] Well, I'm glad
to hear you're getting on

24:24.422 --> 24:25.674
so well in the city.

24:25.715 --> 24:27.801
- Oh yes, I love it.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.220
Kitty has invited me to all
sorts of wonderful lunches

24:30.261 --> 24:31.805
and cocktail parties.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.265
I'm meeting oodles
of important people,

24:34.307 --> 24:35.433
people who could do business

24:35.475 --> 24:37.560
with Father and
Maxwell's family.

24:37.602 --> 24:39.437
- Oh, how very
clever of your, dear.

24:39.479 --> 24:41.022
- In fact,

24:41.064 --> 24:44.818
it's going so well I think I
should stay on a little
longer.

24:44.859 --> 24:45.527
- Oh.

24:45.568 --> 24:46.444
How long?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.863
- At least two weeks,

24:48.905 --> 24:50.365
if that's all right with you.

24:50.407 --> 24:52.367
- Of course it's okay.

24:52.409 --> 24:54.202
You're doing this
for your future.

24:59.582 --> 25:02.460
(suspenseful music)

25:02.502 --> 25:04.337
- What are you doing here?

25:04.379 --> 25:06.589
(Alice clears throat)

25:06.631 --> 25:07.674
- Come with me.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.676
- Where are we going?

25:09.718 --> 25:12.804
- To get dessert and
talk, in that order.

25:16.474 --> 25:29.029
(lively holiday music)

25:29.070 --> 25:30.947
- See the way you're
all looking at me?

25:30.989 --> 25:32.532
That's why I didn't
want to say anything.

25:32.574 --> 25:33.867
- I thought maybe
you came from money,

25:33.908 --> 25:35.952
but I didn't think
you came from money

25:35.994 --> 25:37.120
with a capital M.

25:37.162 --> 25:40.165
- I need you to
understand, I'm not rich,

25:40.206 --> 25:41.708
my parents are.

25:41.750 --> 25:43.835
And there's no point in
getting everyone all riled up,

25:43.877 --> 25:45.795
I'm only here for one season.

25:45.837 --> 25:48.423
And while I'm here,
I'm on my own.

25:48.465 --> 25:49.299
(Janet scoffs)

25:49.341 --> 25:50.425
- Sure you are.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.010
Until things get hard, right?

25:52.052 --> 25:54.220
Then you can go right
back to your real life.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.723
- This is the most real
thing I've ever done.

25:56.765 --> 25:58.975
- I'm just saying it must be
nice to have a safety net.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.560
- I have one more
thing to ask you,

26:00.602 --> 26:01.978
it's very important.

26:02.020 --> 26:02.771
(whimsical music)

26:02.812 --> 26:03.897
Can I borrow that red coat

26:03.938 --> 26:05.648
now that I know
that it's designer?

26:05.690 --> 26:08.902
(Alice and Margaret laugh)

26:08.943 --> 26:09.861
- Of course.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.992
(somber music)

26:21.498 --> 26:24.084
- You would have loved this.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.878
(Sofia kisses)

26:29.714 --> 26:33.259
(somber music continues)

26:33.301 --> 26:35.011
- Are you okay?

26:35.053 --> 26:36.137
- Of course.

26:36.179 --> 26:37.305
You?

26:37.347 --> 26:39.140
- You have a sister?

26:41.476 --> 26:42.310
- Had.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.771
A twin, actually.

26:44.813 --> 26:46.314
She died a few years ago.

26:47.982 --> 26:50.151
Being a Rockette was
our dream together.

26:51.111 --> 26:52.445
The only thing that
was different about us

26:52.487 --> 26:55.323
was I didn't have
a hole in my heart,

26:57.075 --> 26:57.909
but now I do.

26:59.577 --> 27:00.995
- I'm so sorry, Sofia.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.707
It must be so hard
being here without her.

27:03.748 --> 27:05.959
- I can't let it
be hard, though.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.836
I know if I fall apart,
my whole family will.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.921
And I have to be
strong for everyone.

27:09.963 --> 27:12.007
- You don't have to do
that for us, though.

27:12.048 --> 27:15.176
Remember what Mr.
Matthews and Alice said?

27:15.218 --> 27:16.177
We're family now.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.681
- So far that's
been the best part.

27:23.601 --> 27:26.646
Now, come on, let me help
you with that laundry.

27:26.688 --> 27:27.897
Something tells me

27:27.939 --> 27:30.275
you had somebody else
do this for you before.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.985
(Sofia chuckles)

27:32.027 --> 27:32.902
- Alice.

27:34.237 --> 27:35.071
What is this?

27:35.113 --> 27:36.239
- Your paycheck.

27:36.281 --> 27:38.158
But it's probably
pocket change to you.

27:38.199 --> 27:41.703
- Actually, I don't have
any of my own money left,

27:41.745 --> 27:43.329
so this means everything.

27:44.289 --> 27:46.958
(gentle music)

27:52.380 --> 27:53.631
I really like that green coat.

27:53.673 --> 27:54.883
I like it when you wear
your green coat red

27:54.924 --> 27:56.134
and I wear my red coat.

27:56.176 --> 27:57.635
And then we just-
- And then we look

27:57.677 --> 27:58.678
like Christmas?
- We look like Christmas.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.554
After Thanksgiving?
- Yeah.

27:59.596 --> 28:00.764
(John chuckles)

28:00.805 --> 28:02.098
- You really have to
stop following me.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.851
- Sofia and I were just
doing a little shopping.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.854
- Well, if you need me,

28:07.896 --> 28:09.189
I'll be in the shoe department

28:09.230 --> 28:12.359
asking Santa for a pair
of two-tone Chanel pumps.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.778
(John and Margaret laugh)

28:14.819 --> 28:16.488
- Looking for
something specific?

28:16.529 --> 28:17.739
- I'm not sure what
I'm looking for.

28:17.781 --> 28:19.407
- Do you want to go inside?

28:20.408 --> 28:23.495
(lively swing music)

28:25.330 --> 28:26.206
(door clatters)

28:26.247 --> 28:27.415
- Oh, not again.

28:27.457 --> 28:28.667
I'm terribly sorry.

28:28.708 --> 28:29.793
- If it turns out
you're really a hitman,

28:29.834 --> 28:31.920
you're not very good at it.

28:31.961 --> 28:36.091
(lively swing music continues)

28:47.560 --> 28:48.728
- Excuse me.

28:48.770 --> 28:49.896
Could I see this pin?

28:49.938 --> 28:53.441
* And a happy New Year *

28:54.442 --> 28:56.277
- This is beautiful.

28:56.319 --> 28:57.237
I'll take it.

28:59.989 --> 29:02.200
- If you like, you
can put it on layaway

29:02.242 --> 29:03.243
until Christmas Eve.

29:05.036 --> 29:07.247
- You put a little
toward it every week

29:07.288 --> 29:09.332
until you've got
enough to buy it.

29:09.374 --> 29:11.167
- Oh, layaway.

29:11.209 --> 29:12.711
Of course.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.587
But I'm only here until
Christmas, is that enough
time?

29:14.629 --> 29:15.880
- It depends on how
much you put in?

29:15.922 --> 29:17.090
- You're not
staying in New York?

29:17.132 --> 29:18.967
- I'm only dancing
the one season.

29:20.176 --> 29:20.885
Thank you.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.596
* To you and your kin *

29:23.638 --> 29:26.266
* We wish you a
merry Christmas *

29:26.307 --> 29:28.977
(gentle music)

29:35.150 --> 29:37.861
Christmas is always perfect
in this little town, isn't it?

29:37.902 --> 29:38.737
(John chuckles)

29:38.778 --> 29:40.113
- Yeah.

29:40.155 --> 29:42.824
But it's pretty close to
perfect right here too.

29:44.659 --> 29:47.203
- I should probably tell you.

29:48.163 --> 29:50.498
There's somebody waiting
for me back home.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.083
- You don't need
to tell me that.

29:52.125 --> 29:53.626
- I don't?

29:53.668 --> 29:55.628
- I'm leaving soon,
too, remember?

29:55.670 --> 29:56.713
- And then NYU.

29:56.755 --> 29:59.549
- If I had it my way, yes.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.761
I'd be learning from
the best of the best.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.679
Every class is taught
by photographers

30:04.721 --> 30:06.514
who have won Pulitzers

30:06.556 --> 30:09.726
or have their work on the
cover of "National Geographic"

30:09.768 --> 30:12.145
or the front page
at the "Times."

30:12.187 --> 30:14.981
- It sounds like the
opportunity of a lifetime.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.900
- Not if you ask my folks.

30:16.941 --> 30:18.193
If they knew I
wanted to do anything

30:18.234 --> 30:20.111
other than take
over the store,

30:21.571 --> 30:22.864
they'd think I'm
abandoning them.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.115
- But you're not.

30:24.908 --> 30:26.534
You're following your dream.

30:29.079 --> 30:32.499
Imagine how much you'll regret
it if you don't even try.

30:32.540 --> 30:33.875
- I might not even get in.

30:33.917 --> 30:35.710
- Then you take
a different path.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.837
- It's not always that simple.

30:37.879 --> 30:39.005
What would you have done

30:39.047 --> 30:40.465
if you didn't get
cast in the show?

30:41.257 --> 30:43.259
- I'd find a way
to keep dancing.

30:44.344 --> 30:46.429
- But it wouldn't
be like this.

30:46.471 --> 30:48.223
- In my wildest dreams

30:49.432 --> 30:52.143
I didn't think my life
could ever be like this.

30:53.436 --> 30:54.396
- Yet here you are.

30:55.814 --> 30:56.898
- Here I am.

30:59.567 --> 31:02.195
I should probably
go find Sofia.

31:02.237 --> 31:03.655
- Oh, right.

31:03.697 --> 31:04.823
Of course.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.659
- So I'll see you
around the neighborhood?

31:07.701 --> 31:09.786
- Just warn me
when you're nearby

31:09.828 --> 31:11.913
so I can put on a helmet.

31:11.955 --> 31:13.998
(both laugh)

31:14.040 --> 31:16.626
(gentle music)

31:25.010 --> 31:26.761
- Janet, you have to
rock up on your heels

31:26.803 --> 31:28.680
and make sure you have control
of the girl in front of you.

31:28.722 --> 31:30.140
- I'm trying.
- Good.

31:30.181 --> 31:32.892
Just open your arms so the
girl behind you can follow.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.602
(lively jazz music continues)

31:38.314 --> 31:40.483
- Okay, everyone,
attention please.

31:40.525 --> 31:43.319
The "Christmas Spectacular"
opens in four days.

31:43.361 --> 31:44.571
But before that,

31:44.612 --> 31:46.114
some of you will be dancing

31:46.156 --> 31:49.034
in the Thanksgiving
Day parade.

31:49.075 --> 31:52.328
(footsteps clomping)

31:55.290 --> 31:57.000
- Don't you want
to see who got in?

31:57.042 --> 31:58.209
I know we didn't.

31:58.251 --> 31:59.836
Only half the girls
perform, and we're new.

31:59.878 --> 32:01.588
- Actually, a lot of
the veteran dancers

32:01.629 --> 32:03.006
go home for Thanksgiving.

32:07.302 --> 32:08.762
- There we are!

32:08.803 --> 32:10.764
Alice, you're not spending
Thanksgiving with your family?

32:10.805 --> 32:12.724
- This is my family.

32:12.766 --> 32:13.933
I'm curious.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.560
What does your family
think you're doing?

32:15.602 --> 32:18.646
- They think I'm in the
Hamptons with Kitty and her
cousins.

32:18.688 --> 32:20.440
- What if they see you on TV?

32:20.482 --> 32:21.649
- They won't.

32:21.691 --> 32:23.276
I'm the only one who
ever watches the parade.

32:23.318 --> 32:24.778
(gentle music)

32:24.819 --> 32:26.905
(Sofia and Margaret giggling)

32:26.946 --> 32:29.366
- [Dancer] So everybody
won't get along.

32:29.407 --> 32:31.618
(lively music)

32:31.659 --> 32:33.453
- [Announcer] Back for
their second year in a row,

32:33.495 --> 32:37.165
here are the world famous
Radio City Music Hall
Rockettes

32:37.207 --> 32:40.043
now celebrating
their 33rd season.

32:41.336 --> 32:42.170
- That's Sofia.

32:43.588 --> 32:44.381
Man-
- The Rockettes

32:44.422 --> 32:45.256
have been high kicking and-

32:45.298 --> 32:46.174
- She's something, isn't she?

32:46.216 --> 32:47.801
- [Announcer] Since 1925.

32:47.842 --> 32:49.344
- She's incredible.

32:49.386 --> 32:51.054
- [Announcer] Look at these
talented ladies having a ball.

32:51.096 --> 32:52.514
- I still think we
should have insisted

32:52.555 --> 32:55.141
Margaret come home for
Thanksgiving dinner.

32:55.183 --> 32:58.603
- Oh, she's hobnobbing with
New York's elite, dear.

32:58.645 --> 33:00.647
She's doing it for the family.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.107
- I suppose you're right.

33:02.857 --> 33:06.361
(lively music continues)

33:11.991 --> 33:13.618
- Dessert party, fourth floor.

33:13.660 --> 33:16.246
(all cheering)

33:18.331 --> 33:19.416
You coming?

33:19.457 --> 33:21.751
- Actually, I think
I'll take a walk.

33:21.793 --> 33:24.295
I want to take in as much
of the city as I can.

33:24.337 --> 33:26.798
Who knows if I'll ever be
here on Thanksgiving again?

33:26.840 --> 33:28.341
(Margaret chuckles)

33:28.383 --> 33:31.052
(gentle music)

33:51.406 --> 33:55.243
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Miss.
- Excuse-

33:55.285 --> 33:57.037
- I suppose we're even then.

33:57.078 --> 33:58.747
Well played, sir.

33:58.788 --> 34:00.081
- You think I
plotted my revenge

34:00.123 --> 34:01.249
on the off chance

34:01.291 --> 34:02.709
you'd be wandering
the Christmas tree lot

34:02.751 --> 34:05.670
three blocks from your
apartment on Thanksgiving
night?

34:05.712 --> 34:06.588
- Maybe.

34:07.714 --> 34:09.215
- Okay, son, were paid up.

34:09.257 --> 34:10.425
- Oh, Pops, this is Maggie.

34:10.467 --> 34:11.926
She's one of the new
Rockettes this year.

34:11.968 --> 34:12.844
- Oh.

34:12.886 --> 34:14.012
- Nice to meet
you, young lady.

34:14.054 --> 34:15.388
- Nice to meet you.

34:15.430 --> 34:17.015
- Let's get this
tree back to market.

34:17.057 --> 34:18.016
- Gimme a minute,
and I'll help.

34:18.058 --> 34:19.225
- What?

34:19.267 --> 34:20.602
You don't think we
can carry a tree.

34:20.643 --> 34:21.978
We're not that old.

34:22.020 --> 34:23.104
- You stay.

34:24.105 --> 34:24.898
(John chuckles)

34:24.939 --> 34:25.857
- All right.

34:26.900 --> 34:30.362
(Robert straining)

34:30.403 --> 34:33.907
So can I help you
pick out a tree?

34:33.948 --> 34:35.033
There's one.

34:35.075 --> 34:36.368
Oh, there's another one.

34:37.786 --> 34:39.537
- We don't really have room
for a tree on our floor.

34:39.579 --> 34:41.206
- You got to have
a tree somewhere.

34:41.247 --> 34:43.917
- We are living and
breathing Christmas

34:43.958 --> 34:45.251
all day at the theater.

34:45.293 --> 34:46.503
I think we're covered.

34:48.088 --> 34:51.174
I was actually just going on a
Christmas-in-New-York stroll.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.093
I want to take in as
much of the city as I can

34:53.134 --> 34:54.636
while I'm still here.

34:54.678 --> 34:57.097
- You shouldn't be walking
around the city alone at
night.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.099
I'd be happy to
take you around,

34:59.140 --> 35:01.184
purely for safety reasons.

35:01.226 --> 35:02.394
- That's all?

35:02.435 --> 35:04.729
- Well, it can't be
more than that, right?

35:04.771 --> 35:05.980
- No.

35:06.022 --> 35:07.148
Just friends.

35:08.566 --> 35:09.984
- Then yes.

35:10.026 --> 35:11.152
It's for safety.

35:11.986 --> 35:15.490
(gentle music continues)

35:20.578 --> 35:21.413
Two, please.

35:26.334 --> 35:27.836
- Do you have pecans?

35:30.130 --> 35:33.633
I just don't think
anyone actually likes
chestnuts, is all.

35:33.675 --> 35:36.094
- It's a New York City
Christmas tradition.

35:36.136 --> 35:38.054
Also, the song isn't:

35:38.096 --> 35:40.557
* Pecans roasting
on an open fire *

35:40.598 --> 35:41.975
(Margaret laughs)

35:42.017 --> 35:42.976
- Wait, hang on.

35:43.018 --> 35:44.602
You love chestnuts.

35:44.644 --> 35:46.604
You always say
they're your favorite.

35:46.646 --> 35:51.234
- Hmm, that's because
of what happened next.

35:51.276 --> 35:54.237
(both laughing)

35:54.279 --> 35:55.780
- It's so beautiful.

35:55.822 --> 35:58.241
The only thing missing
is a little snow.

35:58.283 --> 35:59.701
- I can make that happen.

36:01.119 --> 36:02.787
- How in the world
did you do that?

36:02.829 --> 36:04.122
(John chuckles)

36:04.164 --> 36:05.331
(Margaret gasps)

36:05.373 --> 36:08.001
- I can always sense
when it's about to snow.

36:08.043 --> 36:09.502
It's a special talent of mine.

36:09.544 --> 36:10.420
- Oh.

36:12.922 --> 36:15.592
Mine's knowing when someone's
not telling the truth.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.344
(John laughs)

36:17.385 --> 36:18.178
- All right, fine.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.304
It was dumb luck.

36:20.138 --> 36:21.348
Oh, by the way,

36:21.389 --> 36:23.892
you were wonderful in
the parade this morning.

36:23.933 --> 36:24.851
- Thank you.

36:26.978 --> 36:30.482
- I love how people react to
the first few flakes of snow.

36:33.401 --> 36:34.819
It's like they're kids again.

36:34.861 --> 36:36.446
You can see it in their face.

36:38.823 --> 36:39.741
What?

36:40.825 --> 36:42.994
- You see things
other people don't,

36:43.036 --> 36:44.746
that's your real
special skill.

36:45.914 --> 36:47.916
I think it's what makes
you a great photographer.

37:00.804 --> 37:02.639
(both laughing)

37:02.681 --> 37:04.057
- Very impressive.

37:04.099 --> 37:05.225
How did you get
him to play that?

37:05.266 --> 37:06.851
- I promised him a
pair of my house seats.

37:06.893 --> 37:08.019
- Oh.

37:08.061 --> 37:09.396
Already bartering
with the vendors.

37:09.437 --> 37:11.690
You really are
becoming a New Yorker.

37:11.731 --> 37:13.400
Don't you have friends and
family who want to use 'em.

37:13.441 --> 37:14.859
I'm sure they're
so proud of you.

37:14.901 --> 37:16.069
- I'd like to think so.

37:16.111 --> 37:18.780
(John chuckles)

37:28.456 --> 37:31.126
You don't always have
to take pictures.

37:31.167 --> 37:32.752
You can join in the fun.

37:32.794 --> 37:33.545
- Ah, no.

37:33.586 --> 37:34.587
I'm not much of a dancer.

37:34.629 --> 37:36.006
- Well, I am.

37:36.047 --> 37:39.009
and I don't want to miss
out on any Christmas magic.

37:39.050 --> 37:39.968
Come on.

37:41.594 --> 37:42.512
Come on.

37:43.221 --> 37:44.305
- All right. Okay.

37:45.807 --> 37:48.059
But I apologize in advance
for when I step on your toes.

37:55.275 --> 37:57.944
(gentle music)

38:12.500 --> 38:13.293
- Oh no.

38:13.335 --> 38:14.336
What time is it?

38:14.377 --> 38:15.962
Oh no, I'm going
to miss curfew.

38:17.005 --> 38:19.716
(both laughing)

38:22.927 --> 38:23.845
I have to go,

38:25.096 --> 38:27.182
but thank you for the
company and the dance

38:27.223 --> 38:28.308
and everything.

38:28.350 --> 38:29.809
- Anytime.

38:29.851 --> 38:30.852
I mean that.

38:32.187 --> 38:34.147
(gentle music continues)

38:34.189 --> 38:49.037
* *

38:49.079 --> 38:59.130
* *

38:59.130 --> 39:09.140
* *

39:29.160 --> 39:39.212
* *

39:39.212 --> 39:49.222
* *

40:09.200 --> 40:19.252
* *

40:19.252 --> 40:28.219
* *

40:28.261 --> 40:30.847
- Wonderful show, ladies.

40:30.889 --> 40:33.183
1 down, 99 to go.

40:33.224 --> 40:34.392
(dancers sighs)

40:34.434 --> 40:35.894
- That's so many.

40:35.935 --> 40:39.314
I'm so glad we only had to
do the first two shows today.

40:39.356 --> 40:40.357
We finally have
the evening off.

40:40.398 --> 40:41.274
What shall we do?

40:41.316 --> 40:42.192
- How about we grab a bite?

40:42.233 --> 40:43.401
- Okay. Where?

40:43.443 --> 40:44.569
- You know where.

40:45.362 --> 40:46.696
Okay, missy,

40:46.738 --> 40:48.615
it's been a week since
your little evening stroll

40:48.656 --> 40:50.492
with a certain Navy man.

40:50.533 --> 40:53.286
Something happened and
you haven't said a word.

40:53.328 --> 40:54.454
Time to let the
cat out of the bag.

40:54.496 --> 40:55.455
- There is no cat.

40:55.497 --> 40:56.414
- Please.

40:56.456 --> 40:57.791
It's a lion.

40:57.832 --> 40:58.750
Talk.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.293
- We just ran into each other.

41:00.335 --> 41:01.252
(Sofia scoffs)

41:01.294 --> 41:03.463
We're friends, that's all.

41:03.505 --> 41:06.758
(gentle music)

41:06.800 --> 41:08.885
- I don't look at my
friends like that.

41:11.137 --> 41:12.263
- What are you doing here?

41:12.305 --> 41:13.139
- You said you
didn't have a tree

41:13.181 --> 41:15.225
so brought you a tree.

41:15.266 --> 41:16.351
Oh, well, uh,

41:16.393 --> 41:17.560
Ben and I.

41:17.602 --> 41:18.436
- What's this?

41:18.478 --> 41:20.021
- A Christmas tree.

41:20.063 --> 41:21.648
- Thanks. But I'm Jewish.

41:21.690 --> 41:23.108
- Rose, what do you say?

41:23.149 --> 41:24.442
Can they bring it in?

41:24.484 --> 41:25.402
- No men allowed.

41:25.443 --> 41:26.861
- What about delivery men?

41:26.903 --> 41:30.031
- I can throw in a
sandwich, make it legit.

41:30.073 --> 41:31.282
- Corned beef?

41:31.324 --> 41:32.826
- Of course.

41:32.867 --> 41:34.244
Extra lean.

41:34.285 --> 41:36.830
- I guess a little holiday
spirit never hurt anyone.

41:36.871 --> 41:38.164
- Common room, only you two.

41:38.206 --> 41:39.541
No shenanigans.

41:41.376 --> 41:42.293
- Oh, that one's
really pretty.

41:42.335 --> 41:43.503
- Right?
- Yeah, I like that one.

41:43.545 --> 41:45.088
- [Girl] I like this
one, the texture of it.

41:45.130 --> 41:48.216
(indistinct chatter)

41:50.593 --> 41:53.054
- Janet, don't
you want to help?

41:55.056 --> 41:56.558
- I need to rest.

41:56.599 --> 41:57.684
- Come on.

41:58.351 --> 41:59.227
It's fine.

42:06.985 --> 42:08.278
- Struffoli?

42:08.319 --> 42:09.738
- I asked around,

42:09.779 --> 42:12.782
got a recipe from a friend
of a friend in Little Italy.

42:13.533 --> 42:16.161
- This is the best
Christmas ever.

42:16.202 --> 42:18.705
- I'm not sure your fella at
home would like to hear that.

42:18.747 --> 42:20.665
- I'm not sure he'd even ask.

42:21.666 --> 42:23.043
What's your favorite color?

42:23.084 --> 42:24.210
(John chuckles)

42:24.252 --> 42:25.670
- Blue, why?

42:25.712 --> 42:27.297
- Middle name?

42:27.339 --> 42:28.465
- Alan.

42:28.506 --> 42:32.052
- And what brings
you the most joy?

42:33.053 --> 42:34.262
- Why all the questions?

42:34.304 --> 42:35.305
- Just humor me.

42:36.890 --> 42:38.391
- Okay.

42:38.433 --> 42:39.267
I'll show you.

42:41.603 --> 42:44.272
(tender music)

42:44.314 --> 42:46.733
I just got these developed.

42:50.445 --> 42:52.113
The last few were my favorite.

42:52.739 --> 42:56.326
(tender music continues)

42:59.454 --> 43:02.415
- This is unlike any
photo I've ever been in.

43:02.457 --> 43:05.627
My family usually
sits posed, formal.

43:06.961 --> 43:09.214
I've never seen myself
like this before.

43:10.298 --> 43:12.759
- It's how I saw you from
the second I met you.

43:14.219 --> 43:15.804
- You are very talented.

43:17.305 --> 43:19.474
Have your parents seen these?

43:19.516 --> 43:20.433
- Not yet.

43:20.475 --> 43:22.102
- What are you waiting for?

43:22.143 --> 43:23.186
Then they'll understand

43:23.228 --> 43:25.438
why you want this
to be your future.

43:25.480 --> 43:27.607
You owe it to
them, to yourself.

43:27.649 --> 43:32.153
- I know, but it's going
to break their hearts.

43:32.195 --> 43:34.322
(tender music continues)

43:34.364 --> 43:36.032
Just waiting for
the right time.

43:37.242 --> 43:38.868
- Maybe the right time is now.

43:40.286 --> 43:41.162
Hm.

43:43.415 --> 43:45.250
When I go home
after Christmas,

43:46.751 --> 43:48.378
things are going to change.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.587
- Haven't they already?

43:49.629 --> 43:53.133
(tender music continues)

43:53.174 --> 43:54.467
- Okay.

43:54.509 --> 43:55.760
We're all set.

43:55.802 --> 43:57.345
Who wants to do the honors?

44:00.265 --> 44:01.808
- I think Janet should do it.

44:03.226 --> 44:05.145
- [All] Janet!

44:05.186 --> 44:06.187
- You've got it.

44:06.229 --> 44:09.232
(all laughing)

44:09.274 --> 44:11.901
(dreamy music)

44:13.445 --> 44:17.449
(group cheering
and applauding)

44:19.325 --> 44:20.618
- Merry Christmas.

44:20.660 --> 44:23.204
(John laughs)

44:24.539 --> 44:26.207
Thank you.

44:26.249 --> 44:28.877
(gentle music)

44:39.137 --> 44:40.972
Are you okay, Alice?

44:41.806 --> 44:42.849
- Yes, I'm fine.

44:43.808 --> 44:45.226
- You don't look fine.

44:45.268 --> 44:47.979
(pensive music)

44:49.981 --> 44:52.776
- You know, I've been
dancing since I could walk.

44:54.569 --> 44:56.863
I thought I'd be able
to do this forever.

44:58.073 --> 45:01.076
And now it's time to start
thinking about what's next.

45:02.994 --> 45:04.996
And I don't know what that is.

45:05.038 --> 45:08.750
(pensive music continues)

45:12.087 --> 45:14.172
- Dearest Mother and Father:

45:14.214 --> 45:17.008
All is well on the
Upper East Side.

45:17.050 --> 45:19.094
I've made some
wonderful new friends,

45:19.135 --> 45:20.845
and every night we're dressed

45:20.887 --> 45:24.557
in the most glittering
dresses you can imagine.

45:24.599 --> 45:26.226
I'm really making a mark here.

45:27.560 --> 45:29.354
(audience cheering)

45:33.817 --> 45:34.859
(Margaret laughs)

45:34.901 --> 45:36.736
Did you see me almost fall?

45:36.778 --> 45:38.363
- Oh, no one noticed...

45:38.405 --> 45:41.032
We were all mesmerized at
Santa trying to do a high
kick.

45:41.074 --> 45:44.369
- Margaret, you
were wonderful.

45:44.411 --> 45:45.412
- Kitty!

45:45.453 --> 45:46.454
Just give a minute.

45:46.496 --> 45:47.872
- Margaret?

45:47.914 --> 45:50.458
- Ah, I didn't realize
you were coming tonight.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.668
- I wanted to surprise you.

45:51.710 --> 45:53.753
I had no idea how
talented you are.

45:53.795 --> 45:55.880
You have to tell your
family about this.

45:55.922 --> 45:57.716
They'll understand once
they see you up there.

45:57.757 --> 45:59.426
- No, they won't.

45:59.467 --> 46:01.428
Just please don't say anything

46:01.469 --> 46:03.263
until after the show is over,

46:03.304 --> 46:05.223
then I'll take
care of everything.

46:05.265 --> 46:07.267
- It's getting harder
to cover for you.

46:07.308 --> 46:08.727
- I'll buy time.

46:08.768 --> 46:10.645
I'll tell Mother your aunt's
still on the design phase.

46:10.687 --> 46:11.855
- Oh, for goodness' sake.

46:11.896 --> 46:13.314
You haven't even met
my Aunt Gabriella.

46:13.356 --> 46:15.400
You are still getting
married, aren't you?

46:15.442 --> 46:16.693
- Of course I am.

46:16.735 --> 46:19.112
I'll make an appointment
for next week.

46:19.154 --> 46:20.071
- Good.

46:20.113 --> 46:21.865
Now, where should
we get drinks?

46:21.906 --> 46:23.616
- I can't go out, Kitty.

46:23.658 --> 46:24.951
I'm going home and
straight to bed.

46:24.993 --> 46:26.786
We have an early
performance tomorrow.

46:26.828 --> 46:29.414
- Well, then I guess
I see you next time

46:29.456 --> 46:30.623
you need to use my phone

46:30.665 --> 46:32.125
or collect your mail

46:32.167 --> 46:35.003
or need help lying to your
fiance and your family.

46:35.045 --> 46:36.421
- I'm sorry, Kitty.

46:37.505 --> 46:40.216
It's more complicated than
I thought it would be.

46:40.258 --> 46:42.302
Are you going to say
anything to them?

46:43.303 --> 46:44.262
- No.

46:44.304 --> 46:45.430
But you should.

46:45.472 --> 46:46.848
You owe them the truth.

46:54.189 --> 46:54.814
- Are you okay?

46:54.856 --> 46:56.149
- No.

46:56.191 --> 46:58.485
I don't know why I thought
I could pull this off.

46:58.526 --> 47:00.445
What was I thinking?

47:00.487 --> 47:01.571
This isn't me.

47:02.739 --> 47:04.699
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

47:04.741 --> 47:06.534
- Well, one thing's for sure.

47:06.576 --> 47:08.536
You're definitely
not Margaret.

47:09.704 --> 47:11.373
(both laughing)

47:11.414 --> 47:12.665
- [Margaret] Let's go.
- [Sofia] Let's go.

47:12.707 --> 47:14.250
- [Margaret] Okay.

47:24.969 --> 47:25.970
- [Stage Manager]
Places, ladies.

47:26.012 --> 47:29.057
(footsteps clomping)

47:29.099 --> 47:32.352
(lively swing music)

47:58.169 --> 48:02.257
(lively swing music continues)

48:10.890 --> 48:13.435
(lively music)

48:23.486 --> 48:26.322
- [Man] Yeah! (cheering)

48:26.364 --> 48:30.618
Wow. (cheering)

48:31.911 --> 48:34.247
- Hey.

48:34.289 --> 48:36.916
- Oh, you were
incredible, Maggie,

48:36.958 --> 48:38.251
just stunning.

48:38.293 --> 48:39.586
- Yeah.

48:39.627 --> 48:42.297
I'm not one for dancing,
but that was pretty great.

48:42.339 --> 48:43.214
- Thank you.

48:44.382 --> 48:45.383
I didn't realize you
were coming tonight.

48:45.425 --> 48:46.718
- Well, we wanted
to surprise you,

48:46.760 --> 48:49.429
but I think you
surprised me even more.

48:49.471 --> 48:51.431
And you were wonderful.

48:51.473 --> 48:52.640
- I'm glad you liked it.

48:53.975 --> 48:55.310
- Are you okay?

48:55.352 --> 48:56.186
- I'm fine.

48:56.227 --> 48:57.771
I just have a lot of my mind.

48:57.812 --> 48:58.980
- I have another
show to do soon

48:59.022 --> 49:00.774
so I have to go back
inside and get ready.

49:00.815 --> 49:02.233
- We should get back
to the market, son.

49:02.275 --> 49:04.527
I want to show you how
we close out the books

49:04.569 --> 49:05.403
at the end of the year.

49:05.445 --> 49:06.863
- All right.

49:06.905 --> 49:08.656
- Congratulations, Maggie.

49:08.698 --> 49:09.491
- Thank you.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.953
So you haven't told them?

49:13.995 --> 49:16.748
- No, but before
you say anything,

49:16.790 --> 49:19.292
I know it's not fair to leave
them in the dark like this.

49:19.334 --> 49:20.835
But if I don't get in NYU,

49:20.877 --> 49:22.379
then there's nothing
to tell them.

49:22.420 --> 49:24.839
I'll be working at the
store just like they wanted.

49:24.881 --> 49:26.299
- So that's it?

49:26.341 --> 49:29.052
Either you give in or you
give up on your dream?

49:29.761 --> 49:30.887
If you really wanted this,

49:30.929 --> 49:33.431
you'd find a way
to make it happen.

49:33.473 --> 49:34.683
- You're right.

49:34.724 --> 49:36.142
I do.

49:36.184 --> 49:39.562
And seeing you up there
makes me even more determined

49:39.604 --> 49:41.147
to make my dreams come true,

49:42.482 --> 49:43.608
just like you.

49:43.650 --> 49:46.361
(gentle music)

49:51.991 --> 49:55.286
(lively swing music)

50:03.003 --> 50:04.129
- You'll never guess

50:04.170 --> 50:06.089
who's on the roll
call list for tonight.

50:06.131 --> 50:07.924
- Frankie Avalon.

50:07.966 --> 50:08.967
- How'd you know?

50:09.009 --> 50:09.843
- Wait.

50:09.884 --> 50:10.719
It really is Frank-

50:10.760 --> 50:12.512
(overlapping chatter)

50:12.554 --> 50:13.722
- He's coming.

50:13.763 --> 50:15.098
- I am going to make
him fall in love with me

50:15.140 --> 50:16.307
from the stage.

50:16.349 --> 50:18.184
- Oh, what about your
boyfriend back home?

50:18.226 --> 50:20.687
- Hey, until there's
a ring on my finger,

50:20.729 --> 50:21.604
all bets are off.

50:21.646 --> 50:22.939
(group laughing)

50:22.981 --> 50:25.150
- Good thing you aren't
engaged to Maxwell, huh?

50:25.191 --> 50:26.026
- Why do you say that?

50:26.067 --> 50:27.777
- You know why?

50:27.819 --> 50:29.195
- Actually, no.

50:29.237 --> 50:31.740
I don't know why you keep
pushing this John thing.

50:33.074 --> 50:35.952
Right now I'm focused
on the show, that's all.

50:35.994 --> 50:37.996
- Please, I see the
way you look at him.

50:38.038 --> 50:39.706
I look at Ben the same way.

50:39.748 --> 50:41.958
And you never look like that
when you talk about Maxwell,

50:42.000 --> 50:44.753
which, by the way,
is almost never.

50:44.794 --> 50:46.004
That's not love.

50:46.046 --> 50:47.505
- I didn't come here for love.

50:47.547 --> 50:49.674
- Maybe it's one of the
reasons you should stay.

50:49.716 --> 50:52.427
(gentle music)

50:52.927 --> 50:53.887
- How are your parents?

50:53.928 --> 50:55.305
- They're fine.

50:55.347 --> 50:57.390
You will be home for the
Christmas party, won't you?

50:57.432 --> 51:00.101
It's practically the same
guest list as our wedding.

51:00.143 --> 51:02.228
Oh, and be sure to
stop at Tiffany's first

51:02.270 --> 51:04.189
and pick yourself out
on a nice present.

51:04.230 --> 51:07.359
- You mean a present from you?

51:07.400 --> 51:09.527
- You know what you like
much more than I do.

51:09.569 --> 51:11.446
I don't want to
disappoint you, darling.

51:11.488 --> 51:13.615
So I'll see you in two weeks.

51:13.656 --> 51:14.741
- [Margaret] Of course.

51:14.783 --> 51:15.867
- Well, goodbye then.

51:15.909 --> 51:16.785
- Goodbye.

51:28.296 --> 51:30.882
- Maggie, would you go out
there and talk to your friend?

51:30.924 --> 51:32.133
He's been circling
the block all day

51:32.175 --> 51:33.927
like like Freddy
Eynsford-Hill.

51:33.968 --> 51:35.303
- I didn't see anyone.

51:36.179 --> 51:38.973
(door clicks)

51:39.015 --> 51:40.725
(gentle music)

51:40.767 --> 51:41.643
Hello?

51:41.685 --> 51:42.560
- Oh, what a coincidence.

51:42.602 --> 51:43.687
I just happened
to be walking by

51:43.728 --> 51:45.772
and here you are. (chuckles)

51:45.814 --> 51:47.273
- Rose said you've been
hanging around all day.

51:47.315 --> 51:49.234
- Yeah, I didn't say how
many times I walked by.

51:49.275 --> 51:50.485
(Margaret chuckles)

51:50.527 --> 51:52.237
I know this show
is dark tonight.

51:52.278 --> 51:53.405
And you said you hadn't gone

51:53.446 --> 51:55.281
to see the Rockefeller
Center tree yet.

51:55.323 --> 51:57.242
And I wanted to take
some more photos there

51:57.283 --> 51:59.244
before I send
off my portfolio,

51:59.285 --> 52:02.539
so I thought maybe
we could go together.

52:04.082 --> 52:05.166
Unless you already went.

52:05.208 --> 52:06.376
- No.

52:06.418 --> 52:07.460
Even though it's so
close to the theater,

52:07.502 --> 52:10.505
we always had a
show, or curfew,

52:11.172 --> 52:12.465
until tonight.

52:12.507 --> 52:13.883
- Then I guess it's fate.

52:14.968 --> 52:16.511
- It just might be.

52:16.553 --> 52:20.640
But it's so complicated, John,

52:21.641 --> 52:22.475
for both of us.

52:22.517 --> 52:23.143
The timing-

52:23.184 --> 52:24.227
- Is all wrong.

52:24.978 --> 52:26.354
I know.

52:26.396 --> 52:27.522
I'm not asking
for anything more

52:27.564 --> 52:30.775
than one more stroll
with a friend.

52:30.817 --> 52:33.528
(tender music)

52:52.922 --> 52:54.257
Are you okay?

52:55.884 --> 52:56.926
- I will be.

52:58.345 --> 53:00.096
I suppose you want to
take a picture of me

53:00.138 --> 53:02.015
having this big
emotional moment.

53:02.057 --> 53:02.932
- No.

53:04.726 --> 53:05.977
- This one's just for us.

53:07.729 --> 53:11.316
(tender music continues)

53:12.192 --> 53:13.985
- You know I can't.

53:14.027 --> 53:14.903
- I know.

53:17.364 --> 53:20.950
But whatever happens,
and wherever we end up,

53:22.410 --> 53:23.787
we can always close our eyes

53:23.828 --> 53:26.706
and be right back here.

53:26.748 --> 53:28.875
(tender music continues)

53:28.917 --> 53:31.294
- What if I don't want
to just imagine it?

53:32.837 --> 53:34.005
(John exhales deeply)

53:34.047 --> 53:38.426
- Then I guess you have
a decision to make.

53:45.266 --> 53:47.936
(gentle music)

53:50.730 --> 53:51.690
- There you are.

53:51.731 --> 53:52.732
- I thought I
was going to have

53:52.774 --> 53:54.109
to send down a
knotted sheet for you

53:54.150 --> 53:56.236
in case Rose locked the doors.

53:56.277 --> 53:57.362
Where were you?

53:57.404 --> 54:00.573
- I was on a walk with John.

54:00.615 --> 54:01.825
- Did John give you that?

54:01.866 --> 54:02.742
- Of course not.

54:04.244 --> 54:05.328
Maxwell did.

54:05.370 --> 54:06.705
- What? When?

54:06.746 --> 54:09.374
- About a year ago.

54:09.416 --> 54:10.583
- Wait a minute.

54:10.625 --> 54:12.752
So this whole time
you've been engaged?

54:12.794 --> 54:14.838
Why didn't you tell me
that in the first place

54:14.879 --> 54:17.590
or literally every other
time we talked about Maxwell?

54:17.632 --> 54:19.634
- I thought I'd
come to New York

54:19.676 --> 54:22.637
and do the show and go
back to my real life.

54:24.222 --> 54:27.017
- Maggie, does John
know you're engaged?

54:27.058 --> 54:28.643
- No.

54:28.685 --> 54:31.062
But I'm going to tell him
right after I talk to my
parents.

54:31.104 --> 54:32.939
I've already decided I'm
calling them in the morning

54:32.981 --> 54:34.607
and telling them everything.

54:34.649 --> 54:35.483
- Good.

54:36.651 --> 54:37.736
Anything else you
want to tell me

54:37.777 --> 54:39.654
that you've held
back this whole time?

54:43.116 --> 54:44.909
- I don't like chicken parm.

54:44.951 --> 54:46.745
- Okay, that's just not funny.

54:46.786 --> 54:48.204
(Sofia chuckles)

54:48.246 --> 54:51.791
Now let me try on
the rock. (laughs)

54:51.833 --> 54:52.876
Oh my gosh.

54:52.917 --> 54:53.752
Oh.

54:53.793 --> 54:55.170
(both laugh)

54:55.211 --> 54:58.048
Oh, a lot of women would
kill for a life like yours.

54:58.089 --> 54:59.716
Are you sure you
want to do this?

55:02.510 --> 55:05.680
- Maggie, your friend Kitty's
in the lobby looking for you.

55:06.848 --> 55:08.808
- At eight in the morning?

55:08.850 --> 55:09.976
- Kitty?

55:10.018 --> 55:11.227
Hi.

55:11.269 --> 55:12.145
I thought our appointment
with your aunt

55:12.187 --> 55:13.355
wasn't until this afternoon.

55:13.396 --> 55:15.190
No matter, I was going
to cancel anyway.

55:15.231 --> 55:16.399
You were right.

55:16.441 --> 55:17.484
It's time for me to tell
my family the truth.

55:17.525 --> 55:19.069
I'm calling them
right after breakfast.

55:19.110 --> 55:19.944
- Margaret, stop.

55:19.986 --> 55:21.154
That's why I came here.

55:21.196 --> 55:22.822
You don't have to
call your parents.

55:22.864 --> 55:24.324
- Why not?

55:24.366 --> 55:26.910
- Because they're on their
way to my apartment right now.

55:26.951 --> 55:28.203
(suspenseful music)

55:28.244 --> 55:29.621
- Oh no!

55:29.662 --> 55:31.831
- That's exactly what I said.

55:31.873 --> 55:33.208
- What did you do?

55:33.249 --> 55:34.668
(Grandma Margaret sighs)

55:34.709 --> 55:37.545
- Let's go back down, and
I'll tell you on the way.

55:42.967 --> 55:44.177
- I do hope my Margaret

55:44.219 --> 55:46.513
hasn't been too much
extra work for you.

55:46.554 --> 55:47.555
- Margaret's been a dream.

55:47.597 --> 55:49.474
You'd barely know
she was here.

55:49.516 --> 55:54.688
- Oh, well, the
apartment is stunning.

55:55.730 --> 55:58.316
Kitty, you have made a
wonderful home for you and
Stewart.

55:58.358 --> 55:59.734
- So where is the young man?

55:59.776 --> 56:01.861
- Oh, he's away on
business until Christmas.

56:01.903 --> 56:05.240
That's why it's been so
nice having Margaret here.

56:05.281 --> 56:06.700
- Well, ladies, the
coffee was delicious,

56:06.741 --> 56:09.703
but I'm ready to go out for
a big New York breakfast.

56:09.744 --> 56:11.371
So what's good around here?

56:11.413 --> 56:14.249
(whimsical music)

56:14.290 --> 56:16.209
- The hotel has a
fine restaurant.

56:16.251 --> 56:17.460
Why don't you get
checked in, eat,

56:17.502 --> 56:18.670
and I'll meet you after that?

56:18.712 --> 56:20.964
- Well, why can't
you come with us?

56:21.006 --> 56:21.881
- I

56:22.966 --> 56:24.092
have an appointment

56:25.510 --> 56:27.512
to taste different
flavors of wedding cake.

56:27.554 --> 56:29.014
- Margaret, (laughs)

56:29.055 --> 56:31.683
you know we have a perfectly
wonderful pastry chef

56:31.725 --> 56:32.851
back home.

56:32.892 --> 56:34.352
- Of course.

56:34.394 --> 56:36.062
I just thought this way I
could narrow down our options.

56:36.104 --> 56:38.356
- Oh, that's an
excellent idea.

56:38.398 --> 56:39.232
I'll go with you.

56:39.274 --> 56:40.108
- Oh, that's okay!

56:42.402 --> 56:45.071
I know you don't like
sweets in the morning.

56:45.113 --> 56:46.239
I'll tell you what,

56:46.281 --> 56:47.282
you go with Father,

56:47.323 --> 56:48.491
I'll go to the tasting,

56:48.533 --> 56:49.909
and I'll meet you at
Gimbels.

56:49.951 --> 56:51.828
Say, 2:00 PM?

56:51.870 --> 56:52.829
Great!

56:52.871 --> 56:54.664
I have to get
going. (chuckles)

56:54.706 --> 56:58.668
(whimsical music continues)

57:00.170 --> 57:03.840
(lively music)

57:05.800 --> 57:06.634
- Taxi!

57:10.638 --> 57:13.058
I know, I have a lot
of explaining to do.

57:13.099 --> 57:14.601
- Actually, you don't.

57:14.642 --> 57:15.935
I caught everyone up.

57:15.977 --> 57:17.395
- You're my new
favorite soap opera

57:17.437 --> 57:18.938
after "Guiding Light."

57:18.980 --> 57:21.024
- I should have told you all
everything from the beginning.

57:21.066 --> 57:24.736
It's just you already
looked at me differently

57:24.778 --> 57:27.947
once you found out I, I
came from money, and...

57:27.989 --> 57:30.617
(gentle music)

57:33.703 --> 57:36.539
I was afraid if you
girls knew I was engaged

57:36.581 --> 57:39.000
and not planning on
coming back to the show,

57:39.959 --> 57:41.670
I would be even
more of an outsider.

57:41.711 --> 57:43.421
- You're not leaving
the show now, are you?

57:43.463 --> 57:44.756
- I don't want to.

57:45.715 --> 57:47.258
But once my family finds out-

57:47.300 --> 57:48.385
- Wait, you still
haven't told them?

57:48.426 --> 57:50.220
- No, I had to
rush right here.

57:50.261 --> 57:51.471
- Uffa!

57:51.513 --> 57:53.056
- [Stage Manager]
Half hour ladies.

57:53.098 --> 57:55.141
This is your half hour call.

57:55.183 --> 57:56.309
- Ready?

57:56.351 --> 57:57.936
- To do the show?

57:57.977 --> 57:59.104
Yes.

57:59.145 --> 58:00.605
To talk to my parents?

58:01.398 --> 58:03.108
It doesn't matter
if I'm ready,

58:03.149 --> 58:04.025
it's now or never.

58:07.987 --> 58:09.531
- Oh good.

58:09.572 --> 58:10.740
I forgot to show you one more
thing with the payroll taxes.

58:10.782 --> 58:12.867
- I have something I
want to show you first.

58:21.376 --> 58:22.752
- What's this?

58:22.794 --> 58:26.673
- It's my application for
NYU's Fine Arts program

58:26.715 --> 58:28.341
for when I get
out of the Navy.

58:28.383 --> 58:30.093
- You won't have
time for college.

58:30.135 --> 58:31.678
You'll be too busy here.

58:31.720 --> 58:33.096
- Well, that's the thing.

58:33.138 --> 58:37.225
I, I'm not sure this is
where I'm meant to end up.

58:37.267 --> 58:39.644
- So you'd rather take
pictures of Christmas trees

58:39.686 --> 58:41.229
than carry on the
family's legacy?

58:41.271 --> 58:42.439
- It's not about Christmas.

58:42.480 --> 58:44.733
It's about me being
a photojournalist,

58:46.109 --> 58:47.027
professionally.

58:48.111 --> 58:49.404
I, I, I got a real
knack for it, Pop.

58:49.446 --> 58:51.656
- You have a responsibility
to this family.

58:51.698 --> 58:53.658
- Ben is family too.

58:53.700 --> 58:54.743
And he would make you so proud

58:54.784 --> 58:55.910
if you just gave him a chance.

58:55.952 --> 58:58.747
- It says Slater
and Son, that's you.

58:58.788 --> 59:01.207
We work night and day to
have this, to give it to you,

59:01.249 --> 59:03.501
and now you want to
just throw it all away?

59:03.543 --> 59:04.669
- That's not what I'm doing.

59:04.711 --> 59:06.338
I'm trying to do what's
best for everyone.

59:06.379 --> 59:09.924
(pensive music continues)

59:15.513 --> 59:18.099
(jaunty music)

59:41.289 --> 59:54.052
(lively jazz music)

59:54.094 --> 59:55.261
- Taxi!

59:55.303 --> 59:59.140
(lively jazz music continues)

1:00:01.601 --> 1:00:04.688
- Oh, this is so much better.

1:00:05.647 --> 1:00:09.109
Now, while your
father is not with us,

1:00:09.150 --> 1:00:11.695
I perhaps will buy
his Christmas gift.

1:00:11.736 --> 1:00:13.988
And you should get
something from Maxwell.

1:00:25.458 --> 1:00:26.626
- Maggie.

1:00:26.668 --> 1:00:29.004
- I'm so sorry, Mr. Matthews.

1:00:30.005 --> 1:00:33.341
- Something is obviously
going on with you.

1:00:33.383 --> 1:00:34.676
You can talk to me.

1:00:36.344 --> 1:00:37.804
- My parents are here.

1:00:37.846 --> 1:00:39.472
They think I'm in New York
to have a wedding dress made,

1:00:39.514 --> 1:00:40.849
and they don't know
I'm a Rockette.

1:00:40.890 --> 1:00:42.017
They would never approve.

1:00:42.058 --> 1:00:43.184
And I'm afraid of
what will happen

1:00:43.226 --> 1:00:44.185
if I tell them the truth.

1:00:45.145 --> 1:00:46.396
- At some point, Maggie,

1:00:46.438 --> 1:00:48.398
you're going to
have to just let go

1:00:48.440 --> 1:00:50.817
of what other people
expect you to be

1:00:50.859 --> 1:00:52.485
and just be who you are.

1:00:52.527 --> 1:00:55.155
(gentle music)

1:00:59.409 --> 1:01:00.618
Take the rest of the day off,

1:01:00.660 --> 1:01:02.537
we'll have a swing
cover for you,

1:01:02.579 --> 1:01:06.374
and go do what you have
to do for yourself.

1:01:07.250 --> 1:01:08.752
Hmm?

1:01:08.793 --> 1:01:10.337
- Thank you.

1:01:10.378 --> 1:01:13.048
(gentle music)

1:01:13.715 --> 1:01:15.717
- I don't know, she's...

1:01:15.759 --> 1:01:18.511
Oh, you look much
better now, dear.

1:01:18.553 --> 1:01:19.637
Are you ready for dinner?

1:01:19.679 --> 1:01:20.847
- Yes.

1:01:20.889 --> 1:01:22.766
But I've been trying to
reach Maxwell all day.

1:01:22.807 --> 1:01:25.018
I've tried him at the
office, the club, his house.

1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:27.937
- I think you'll be able
to reach him very soon.

1:01:27.979 --> 1:01:30.023
- Can we ask for
a quiet table?

1:01:30.065 --> 1:01:32.150
I really need to talk to you
about something important.

1:01:32.192 --> 1:01:36.279
- Actually, we already have
a table right over there.

1:01:36.321 --> 1:01:39.324
(suspenseful music)

1:01:43.244 --> 1:01:46.247
(gentle piano music)

1:01:47.707 --> 1:01:49.668
- Are you surprised, darling?

1:01:49.709 --> 1:01:50.669
- You have no idea.

1:01:50.710 --> 1:01:53.588
(Maxwell chuckles)

1:01:53.630 --> 1:01:55.090
Thank you.

1:01:55.131 --> 1:01:59.719
(gentle piano music continues)

1:01:59.761 --> 1:02:01.554
- Just in time.

1:02:01.596 --> 1:02:03.348
Would you like a
cocktail, darling?

1:02:03.390 --> 1:02:04.307
- Ah, yes.

1:02:04.349 --> 1:02:05.392
A double old
fashioned, please.

1:02:05.433 --> 1:02:06.601
Easy on the water.

1:02:06.643 --> 1:02:08.478
- Isn't that basically
a straight bourbon?

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:09.396
- Is it?

1:02:12.023 --> 1:02:13.900
(glass thuds)
(Margaret sighs)

1:02:13.942 --> 1:02:16.986
- Mother, Father, Maxwell,

1:02:18.113 --> 1:02:21.157
I have something to tell you
about my time here in New
York.

1:02:22.117 --> 1:02:25.745
- Wait, before you do, I
have something for you.

1:02:25.787 --> 1:02:27.372
An early Christmas gift.

1:02:27.414 --> 1:02:28.456
- Thank you, Maxwell.

1:02:28.498 --> 1:02:29.749
I'll open it right
after we talk.

1:02:29.791 --> 1:02:31.084
- Open it now.

1:02:31.126 --> 1:02:32.961
Don't be rude.

1:02:33.003 --> 1:02:35.505
(gentle piano music continues)

1:02:35.547 --> 1:02:38.591
(Maxwell and Margaret chuckle)

1:02:38.633 --> 1:02:40.010
- You couldn't stop
talking about them

1:02:40.051 --> 1:02:42.512
after you saw them
at the parade.

1:02:42.554 --> 1:02:45.598
So as much as I loath going
to any sort of ballet.

1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:47.183
(Grant chuckles)

1:02:47.225 --> 1:02:51.021
I figured I could grin and
bear it for one night, for
you.

1:02:51.813 --> 1:02:53.898
See, they're for
Christmas Eve.

1:02:55.775 --> 1:02:56.609
- Look at her.

1:02:56.651 --> 1:02:58.194
She's so happy.

1:02:58.236 --> 1:02:59.779
She's speechless.

1:02:59.821 --> 1:03:01.990
- Thank you, Maxwell.

1:03:02.032 --> 1:03:03.950
It really was very thoughtful.

1:03:03.992 --> 1:03:05.452
- I can get you something else

1:03:05.493 --> 1:03:06.786
if you don't want to go.

1:03:06.828 --> 1:03:07.871
- Oh no.

1:03:08.538 --> 1:03:10.457
I'm definitely going because,

1:03:11.499 --> 1:03:14.753
(gentle piano music continues)

1:03:14.794 --> 1:03:15.837
because

1:03:18.506 --> 1:03:20.342
I'm in the show.

1:03:20.383 --> 1:03:21.634
- Uh,

1:03:21.676 --> 1:03:22.469
I'm sorry.

1:03:22.510 --> 1:03:24.971
I, I don't understand.

1:03:25.013 --> 1:03:26.973
- That's what I
wanted to tell you.

1:03:28.183 --> 1:03:30.477
I didn't come to New York
to have a wedding dress made

1:03:30.518 --> 1:03:32.645
or register for gifts

1:03:32.687 --> 1:03:34.856
or make connections
or visit Kitty.

1:03:35.815 --> 1:03:37.484
I came here because
back in October,

1:03:37.525 --> 1:03:42.364
I auditioned for the
Rockettes and they picked me.

1:03:42.405 --> 1:03:43.448
- I'm sorry.

1:03:43.490 --> 1:03:45.658
I think I, I'm
missing the joke here.

1:03:45.700 --> 1:03:47.494
- This isn't a joke.

1:03:47.535 --> 1:03:49.537
I really am a Rockette.

1:03:49.579 --> 1:03:51.039
- Stop it, Margaret.

1:03:51.956 --> 1:03:54.376
We know you'd never
do such a thing.

1:03:54.417 --> 1:03:56.002
- Just come to the show.

1:03:56.044 --> 1:03:57.087
See for yourself.

1:03:58.088 --> 1:04:00.715
(gentle piano music continues)

1:04:00.757 --> 1:04:02.676
This isn't something
to be ashamed of,

1:04:02.717 --> 1:04:04.511
it's something to be proud of.

1:04:05.637 --> 1:04:07.514
(Elisabeth sobbing)

1:04:07.555 --> 1:04:08.473
- Oh, now look
what you've done.

1:04:08.515 --> 1:04:10.392
You've upset your mother.

1:04:14.396 --> 1:04:17.107
- Is this all true?

1:04:17.148 --> 1:04:19.192
- This life we planned,

1:04:19.234 --> 1:04:22.028
we didn't plan it for
ourselves, did we?

1:04:22.070 --> 1:04:24.864
This was all put
together by our families.

1:04:24.906 --> 1:04:26.908
Are you really okay
with marrying someone

1:04:26.950 --> 1:04:28.284
you don't even love?

1:04:28.326 --> 1:04:29.160
- Darling,

1:04:30.578 --> 1:04:32.997
I'm not sure anyone in our
position marries for love.

1:04:33.039 --> 1:04:34.708
Because if I'm being honest,

1:04:34.749 --> 1:04:36.960
I don't believe true
love exists at all.

1:04:37.752 --> 1:04:39.921
- But it does, Maxwell.

1:04:42.007 --> 1:04:45.051
And I think we both deserve
the chance to find it.

1:04:46.261 --> 1:04:47.053
- I see.

1:04:47.095 --> 1:04:50.682
(pensive music continues)

1:04:54.602 --> 1:04:56.062
- I'm sorry, Max.

1:05:00.984 --> 1:05:02.444
- Don't be sorry, darling.

1:05:03.737 --> 1:05:05.030
You're happy here.

1:05:05.989 --> 1:05:08.450
How can I be upset about that?

1:05:08.491 --> 1:05:13.413
- Thank you.

1:05:14.622 --> 1:05:17.459
(Margaret sighs)

1:05:18.209 --> 1:05:21.421
- So are you ever coming home?

1:05:22.589 --> 1:05:24.299
- I think I am home.

1:05:28.970 --> 1:05:31.973
(Margaret sighs)

1:05:33.516 --> 1:05:34.351
- Max?

1:05:35.727 --> 1:05:37.062
Where's he going?

1:05:37.103 --> 1:05:38.813
- Back to Philadelphia,
I imagine.

1:05:38.855 --> 1:05:39.814
- Good.

1:05:39.856 --> 1:05:40.774
We'll stop by Kitty's,

1:05:40.815 --> 1:05:41.941
pick up your things,

1:05:41.983 --> 1:05:43.651
and we can all catch
the last train home.

1:05:43.693 --> 1:05:45.945
- My things aren't at Kitty's,

1:05:45.987 --> 1:05:47.989
they're at a women's
boarding house.

1:05:49.032 --> 1:05:50.742
And I'm not going
back with you.

1:05:51.868 --> 1:05:54.037
I'm staying in New
York, permanently.

1:05:54.079 --> 1:05:56.122
- But that's preposterous.

1:05:56.164 --> 1:05:58.792
You can't make it in
this city by yourself.

1:05:58.833 --> 1:06:00.919
- Yes, I can.

1:06:00.960 --> 1:06:02.837
- But you're giving
up your future.

1:06:02.879 --> 1:06:04.255
And for what?

1:06:04.297 --> 1:06:05.465
To dance?

1:06:05.507 --> 1:06:08.176
- That's what you don't
understand, Mother.

1:06:08.218 --> 1:06:10.887
It's about so much
more than that.

1:06:10.929 --> 1:06:13.264
It's about the friendships,
the camaraderie,

1:06:13.306 --> 1:06:16.393
the pride we have
in what we do.

1:06:17.644 --> 1:06:19.270
We make each other better,

1:06:21.773 --> 1:06:23.733
not just as dancers

1:06:24.734 --> 1:06:26.236
but as strong,

1:06:26.277 --> 1:06:29.948
confident women who can make
their own dreams come true.

1:06:29.989 --> 1:06:31.157
- I've heard enough.

1:06:32.492 --> 1:06:34.869
If you're not at the hotel
in two hours, Margaret,

1:06:34.911 --> 1:06:37.455
don't bother coming
back home at all.

1:06:37.497 --> 1:06:38.998
- You would cut me
off from my family

1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:40.500
for following my dreams?

1:06:40.542 --> 1:06:41.751
- I'm trying to save you

1:06:41.793 --> 1:06:44.045
from making the biggest
mistake in your life.

1:06:45.338 --> 1:06:48.258
- My only mistake was
hoping you'd understand.

1:06:50.593 --> 1:06:51.720
- Elisabeth, let's go.

1:06:54.431 --> 1:06:55.306
Elisabeth.

1:06:58.435 --> 1:07:01.104
(somber music)

1:07:03.982 --> 1:07:06.735
(Margaret sighs)

1:07:08.111 --> 1:07:10.739
(gentle music)

1:07:11.740 --> 1:07:13.700
- Hi.

1:07:13.742 --> 1:07:14.701
How did you-

1:07:14.743 --> 1:07:16.202
- Ben gave me your address.

1:07:16.995 --> 1:07:18.371
Is that your application?

1:07:18.413 --> 1:07:20.165
- It is.

1:07:20.206 --> 1:07:21.958
I was just going
to drop it off.

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:23.168
- That's wonderful.

1:07:23.209 --> 1:07:24.085
When will you find
out if you got in?

1:07:24.127 --> 1:07:25.754
- While I'm at sea?

1:07:25.795 --> 1:07:27.422
So when I get back,

1:07:27.464 --> 1:07:32.177
I'll either be doing
Slater and Son or this.

1:07:32.218 --> 1:07:34.554
- I suppose that means
you told your parents.

1:07:34.596 --> 1:07:37.807
- I did, but they
don't understand.

1:07:39.267 --> 1:07:40.810
I'm not judging their choices,

1:07:40.852 --> 1:07:43.730
I just wanted to make my own.

1:07:43.772 --> 1:07:44.606
- So did I?

1:07:45.648 --> 1:07:46.566
And I have.

1:07:47.901 --> 1:07:49.402
I have a lot to tell you.

1:07:49.444 --> 1:07:51.321
- I, I, I need
to drop this off.

1:07:51.363 --> 1:07:53.198
Do you have time for a walk?

1:07:53.239 --> 1:07:54.783
- As a matter of fact, I do.

1:07:58.203 --> 1:08:00.080
- Maybe I should have written
a letter to Santa too.

1:08:00.121 --> 1:08:02.540
You think he knows
anyone in admissions?

1:08:02.582 --> 1:08:03.249
(both chuckle)

1:08:03.291 --> 1:08:04.167
- Well, if he doesn't,

1:08:04.209 --> 1:08:05.335
I'm sure my grandfather does.

1:08:05.377 --> 1:08:07.170
He's on the Board of Trustees.

1:08:08.213 --> 1:08:10.423
- You didn't think to
tell me that until now?

1:08:10.465 --> 1:08:14.761
- There's a few things about
my family I didn't mention.

1:08:14.803 --> 1:08:16.262
- I already know, Maggie.

1:08:18.139 --> 1:08:19.182
- You do?

1:08:19.974 --> 1:08:21.309
- Your family is rich.

1:08:22.268 --> 1:08:23.853
Sofia let it slip to Ben.

1:08:24.938 --> 1:08:26.606
- Yes, it's true.

1:08:27.982 --> 1:08:30.235
But I'm on my own
now, completely,

1:08:30.276 --> 1:08:32.195
that's what I
wanted to tell you.

1:08:34.322 --> 1:08:36.157
I broke off my
engagement, John,

1:08:36.199 --> 1:08:37.367
and I'm staying in New York.

1:08:37.409 --> 1:08:38.451
So when you get back-

1:08:38.493 --> 1:08:39.494
- Stop, back up.

1:08:40.537 --> 1:08:41.663
You were engaged?

1:08:42.497 --> 1:08:44.332
- Ben didn't tell
you that part.

1:08:45.458 --> 1:08:46.543
- No.

1:08:46.584 --> 1:08:47.419
- Oh.

1:08:48.420 --> 1:08:49.045
Okay.

1:08:49.087 --> 1:08:51.798
Uh, I was engaged,

1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:54.551
but we're both from
prominent families, you see?

1:08:54.592 --> 1:08:56.970
So it was more of a
marriage of convenience,

1:08:57.012 --> 1:08:58.638
it wasn't real love, not like,

1:08:59.639 --> 1:09:02.183
not like what I
know is possible.

1:09:03.184 --> 1:09:05.228
- I wish you would have
told me all this before.

1:09:05.270 --> 1:09:07.731
- But we were just friends.

1:09:07.772 --> 1:09:09.232
Isn't that what we said?

1:09:09.274 --> 1:09:11.484
I wasn't ready to
tell you everything,

1:09:11.526 --> 1:09:12.861
but now I am.

1:09:12.902 --> 1:09:15.864
I just needed time to figure
things out for myself.

1:09:17.032 --> 1:09:18.575
But I made my choice.

1:09:20.452 --> 1:09:24.330
I choose New York and
being a dancer, and,

1:09:26.750 --> 1:09:28.168
and you.

1:09:28.209 --> 1:09:30.211
(gentle music)

1:09:30.253 --> 1:09:32.547
I thought you'd be happy.

1:09:33.882 --> 1:09:35.216
- How can I be happy?

1:09:36.051 --> 1:09:37.385
I told you everything
about myself,

1:09:37.427 --> 1:09:39.012
and it turns out I
didn't know you at all.

1:09:39.054 --> 1:09:40.180
- You do know me.

1:09:40.221 --> 1:09:41.389
You helped me see who I am.

1:09:41.431 --> 1:09:42.599
- You told me over and over

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:44.142
I owed it to my family
to tell them the truth,

1:09:44.184 --> 1:09:46.186
and this entire time
you were lying to yours.

1:09:46.227 --> 1:09:47.354
- But I did tell them.

1:09:47.395 --> 1:09:49.647
- Only when you had
no other choice.

1:09:49.689 --> 1:09:51.274
You knew that if
it didn't work out,

1:09:51.316 --> 1:09:52.692
you would just go
back to Philadelphia

1:09:52.734 --> 1:09:55.862
and pretend like none of
this ever happened; but me,

1:09:55.904 --> 1:09:57.238
I'm risking everything.

1:09:57.280 --> 1:09:58.865
- Well, then let me at least
talk to my grandfather.

1:09:58.907 --> 1:10:00.283
- Why?

1:10:00.325 --> 1:10:01.201
'Cause you don't think I
can make it in on my own.

1:10:01.242 --> 1:10:02.869
- I'm not saying that at all.

1:10:02.911 --> 1:10:04.371
I care about you.

1:10:04.412 --> 1:10:05.955
I just want to help you.

1:10:07.749 --> 1:10:10.585
- Did your grandfather help
you get into the Rockettes?

1:10:12.170 --> 1:10:13.338
- I did that on my own.

1:10:13.380 --> 1:10:16.508
- And that's how
I want to do this,

1:10:16.549 --> 1:10:17.926
on my own.

1:10:17.967 --> 1:10:20.637
(somber music)

1:10:22.305 --> 1:10:25.975
(Margaret exhales sharply)

1:10:35.318 --> 1:10:38.071
(cheerful music)

1:10:38.113 --> 1:10:39.864
- The show wasn't
the same without you.

1:10:39.906 --> 1:10:41.366
Are you okay?

1:10:41.408 --> 1:10:42.742
- Never better.

1:10:42.784 --> 1:10:44.494
Rose said I could
stay at the apartment

1:10:44.536 --> 1:10:46.287
during the off-season
while I look for work.

1:10:46.329 --> 1:10:48.623
And I have a lead on a
sales job at Gimble's.

1:10:48.665 --> 1:10:50.458
- Maggie, did
you talk to John?

1:10:52.127 --> 1:10:52.961
- I did.

1:10:54.963 --> 1:10:56.756
It didn't work out.

1:10:56.798 --> 1:10:57.966
It's fine.

1:10:58.008 --> 1:11:00.301
I came to New York
to be a dancer,

1:11:00.343 --> 1:11:02.971
not to fall in love.

1:11:04.639 --> 1:11:06.850
I should have just
focused on the job,

1:11:06.891 --> 1:11:08.059
that's what matters.

1:11:08.101 --> 1:11:11.479
Until you can't do the
job anymore, then what?

1:11:11.521 --> 1:11:12.981
- What's going on, Alice?

1:11:14.858 --> 1:11:16.943
- I think it's time I
should listen to my body

1:11:16.985 --> 1:11:19.446
and hang up my tap shoes.

1:11:20.488 --> 1:11:24.534
So in three days, when
this show is over, so am I.

1:11:26.578 --> 1:11:28.663
And I do not know
what to do next.

1:11:29.998 --> 1:11:33.376
This show is everything to me,

1:11:35.128 --> 1:11:36.713
it made me who I am.

1:11:38.673 --> 1:11:40.175
And I, I just don't
want to leave.

1:11:40.216 --> 1:11:42.510
- We don't want you
to leave either.

1:11:43.678 --> 1:11:45.680
But I know one thing for sure,

1:11:45.722 --> 1:11:48.141
no matter where any of us are,

1:11:48.183 --> 1:11:49.684
we'll always be sisters.

1:11:50.852 --> 1:11:53.480
I know mine would have
loved you girls so much.

1:11:53.521 --> 1:11:56.733
(Margaret sniffles)

1:11:58.276 --> 1:11:59.319
Really, Janet.

1:11:59.361 --> 1:12:00.403
Nothing?

1:12:01.738 --> 1:12:04.491
- You don't have to do
this alone anymore, Janet.

1:12:04.532 --> 1:12:05.867
- We're your friends.

1:12:08.036 --> 1:12:11.039
- But that's just
it. (sniffling)

1:12:11.081 --> 1:12:13.458
I never let myself
have friends.

1:12:13.500 --> 1:12:16.378
Everyone I met was
just the competition.

1:12:18.713 --> 1:12:19.839
And you girls have stood by me

1:12:19.881 --> 1:12:21.883
no matter how hard
I pushed you away.

1:12:23.093 --> 1:12:24.886
And I tried hard.

1:12:26.096 --> 1:12:27.097
- We know.

1:12:27.138 --> 1:12:28.682
(all laughing)

1:12:28.723 --> 1:12:31.434
(gentle music)

1:12:32.394 --> 1:12:34.771
- You helped me
the most, you know?

1:12:34.813 --> 1:12:36.523
Your friendship is the
best Christmas present

1:12:36.564 --> 1:12:38.149
I ever could have been given.

1:12:39.234 --> 1:12:41.194
I just don't want this to end.

1:12:41.236 --> 1:12:42.737
- None of us do.

1:12:46.366 --> 1:12:49.077
- Nothing like a piece of
pie after a good cry,

1:12:49.119 --> 1:12:50.078
I always say.

1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:53.581
(all laughing)

1:12:57.794 --> 1:13:00.797
- I don't have
anything to say.

1:13:00.839 --> 1:13:05.218
My father built this
business for him then for me,

1:13:05.260 --> 1:13:07.679
and I thought someday for you.

1:13:08.513 --> 1:13:09.806
It's our legacy.

1:13:10.849 --> 1:13:11.891
- But don't you see?

1:13:13.101 --> 1:13:16.229
You made me into a man
who could see beauty

1:13:16.271 --> 1:13:17.689
in the simple things:

1:13:18.606 --> 1:13:22.944
in family, in hard
work, in sacrifice.

1:13:27.407 --> 1:13:30.035
(gentle music)

1:13:37.125 --> 1:13:38.043
Don't you see, Pop?

1:13:41.504 --> 1:13:42.964
The store isn't your legacy,

1:13:44.299 --> 1:13:45.133
I am.

1:13:47.510 --> 1:13:49.262
- Oh, Robert.

1:13:49.304 --> 1:13:51.973
(pensive music)

1:13:53.933 --> 1:13:56.144
- You can really make
a living doing this?

1:13:56.186 --> 1:13:57.562
(John laughs)

1:13:57.604 --> 1:13:58.646
- I really can.

1:14:00.148 --> 1:14:03.735
And the Slater name will be
under every single picture.

1:14:07.655 --> 1:14:09.157
- It's good advertising.

1:14:09.199 --> 1:14:11.534
(John chuckles)

1:14:11.576 --> 1:14:14.954
(pensive music continues)

1:14:14.996 --> 1:14:16.998
- Is something
still wrong, Johnny?

1:14:20.543 --> 1:14:23.213
(gentle music)

1:14:32.430 --> 1:14:33.723
- Uh, who are you here to see?

1:14:33.765 --> 1:14:35.475
- [Harriet] Maggie Bennett.
- Margaret Bennett.

1:14:35.517 --> 1:14:37.143
I'm her mother.

1:14:37.185 --> 1:14:38.478
- Sorry, she already left.

1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:40.105
Next show starts in two hours.

1:14:41.314 --> 1:14:42.399
- I guess we'll
have to come back.

1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:43.316
- I'm sorry.

1:14:43.358 --> 1:14:44.317
How do you know my daughter?

1:14:44.359 --> 1:14:45.151
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:14:45.193 --> 1:14:46.027
How rude of me?

1:14:46.069 --> 1:14:47.362
I'm Harriet Slater.

1:14:47.404 --> 1:14:49.072
John Slater's my son.

1:14:49.114 --> 1:14:51.074
It's sad what happened.

1:14:51.116 --> 1:14:54.536
It really seemed that John
had found his perfect match.

1:14:55.578 --> 1:14:56.996
I thought that if I
could come talk to Maggie

1:14:57.038 --> 1:14:59.499
I could maybe figure
out a way to help.

1:14:59.541 --> 1:15:04.170
- I'm sorry, I, I, I
didn't know about your son.

1:15:04.212 --> 1:15:05.380
- You didn't?

1:15:05.422 --> 1:15:07.507
- No, I just came back
to convince my daughter

1:15:07.549 --> 1:15:11.011
to stop this nonsense
and come home.

1:15:11.052 --> 1:15:13.596
- Have you seen the
show, Mrs. Bennett?

1:15:13.638 --> 1:15:15.140
- No, I haven't.

1:15:15.181 --> 1:15:19.227
- If you had, you wouldn't
want to talk her out of that.

1:15:20.186 --> 1:15:23.189
It's like when I saw my
son John's photographs,

1:15:23.231 --> 1:15:26.693
I knew that that's what
he was meant to do too.

1:15:26.735 --> 1:15:29.237
But I think they were
meant to do it together.

1:15:30.113 --> 1:15:31.573
John loves her.

1:15:31.614 --> 1:15:33.575
- Does Margaret love him?

1:15:34.409 --> 1:15:37.037
(gentle music)

1:15:41.541 --> 1:15:44.753
(Elisabeth chuckles)

1:15:48.548 --> 1:15:50.884
I need to make things right.

1:15:50.925 --> 1:15:51.843
- We both do.

1:15:59.768 --> 1:16:01.394
- I can't believe this is it,

1:16:01.436 --> 1:16:03.229
our last show.

1:16:03.271 --> 1:16:04.356
Hmm.

1:16:04.397 --> 1:16:05.940
And my parents never saw it.

1:16:05.982 --> 1:16:07.609
- Maybe they'll come
around next season.

1:16:07.650 --> 1:16:10.070
- Speaking of next season.

1:16:10.111 --> 1:16:11.988
Alice, can we talk?

1:16:15.075 --> 1:16:17.577
- I know what you're going
to say, Mr. Matthews.

1:16:17.619 --> 1:16:20.288
I know that this is
my last season and-

1:16:20.330 --> 1:16:23.083
- On-stage, perhaps.

1:16:23.124 --> 1:16:27.754
But I've seen how much
you help everyone here,

1:16:27.796 --> 1:16:29.506
how selfless you are,

1:16:29.547 --> 1:16:31.549
and how much these
girls look up to you.

1:16:31.591 --> 1:16:33.259
I think every one
of these girls

1:16:33.301 --> 1:16:34.594
came into my office this week

1:16:34.636 --> 1:16:38.139
to tell me how much they
love you and need you,

1:16:38.181 --> 1:16:40.308
one in particular.

1:16:41.851 --> 1:16:45.063
The way you stood by Janet
and brought her along,

1:16:45.105 --> 1:16:48.775
that's the sort of leadership
we're looking for around here.

1:16:50.318 --> 1:16:51.903
- So, so what are you saying?

1:16:51.945 --> 1:16:55.115
- We would like to offer you
the position of dance captain.

1:16:56.282 --> 1:16:58.618
You'd make sure the girls
know their choreography,

1:16:58.660 --> 1:17:01.496
run rehearsals and maybe
fill in now and then.

1:17:01.538 --> 1:17:05.125
(Mr. Matthews laughing)

1:17:05.166 --> 1:17:06.918
Merry Christmas, Alice.

1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:09.462
- Merry Christmas,
Mr. Matthews.

1:17:09.504 --> 1:17:11.715
- Ladies, have a good show.

1:17:11.756 --> 1:17:13.466
Hmm?
- Thank you.

1:17:13.508 --> 1:17:16.177
(all laughing)

1:17:19.180 --> 1:17:20.849
- Thank you, everyone,

1:17:22.684 --> 1:17:23.935
especially you.

1:17:24.811 --> 1:17:26.271
- Anything for a friend.

1:17:29.274 --> 1:17:30.650
- [Stage Manager]
Five minutes, ladies.

1:17:30.692 --> 1:17:34.320
- [Alice] Oh.

1:17:34.362 --> 1:17:37.115
- This just got delivered
for you, Maggie,

1:17:37.157 --> 1:17:38.199
from Gimble's.

1:17:38.825 --> 1:17:40.201
- I didn't order anything.

1:17:42.662 --> 1:17:43.788
For Maggie,

1:17:45.123 --> 1:17:47.292
who will always be part
of Christmas in New York.

1:17:48.209 --> 1:17:49.085
Love, John.

1:17:53.423 --> 1:17:54.924
(gentle music)

1:17:54.966 --> 1:17:55.842
Hmm.

1:17:57.302 --> 1:17:59.971
He must have paid for this
before everything happened.

1:18:00.638 --> 1:18:01.931
He did love me,

1:18:04.434 --> 1:18:05.935
and I loved him.

1:18:05.977 --> 1:18:07.354
- I'm so sorry, Maggie.

1:18:09.773 --> 1:18:10.857
- It's fine.

1:18:12.067 --> 1:18:14.069
At least now I know for
sure how love feels.

1:18:16.404 --> 1:18:18.114
- Are you sure you
want to keep it?

1:18:18.156 --> 1:18:20.867
You don't think it'll
remind of you what you lost?

1:18:22.118 --> 1:18:23.536
- No.

1:18:23.578 --> 1:18:25.455
It reminds me of
how far I've come.

1:18:27.248 --> 1:18:29.459
- [Stage Manager]
Places, please, ladies.

1:18:34.214 --> 1:18:35.548
(gentle music)

1:18:35.590 --> 1:18:39.260
(Margaret breathes deeply)

1:18:48.144 --> 1:18:50.814
(lively music)

1:19:01.491 --> 1:19:04.869
(marching band music)

1:19:07.163 --> 1:19:10.041
(explosion booms)

1:19:11.459 --> 1:19:14.254
(trilling music)

1:19:24.848 --> 1:19:28.518
(trilling music continues)

1:19:39.154 --> 1:19:41.573
(lively music)

1:19:49.414 --> 1:19:51.458
(Margaret sighs)

1:19:51.499 --> 1:19:54.544
(lively swing music)

1:20:12.854 --> 1:20:16.983
(lively swing music continues)

1:20:40.757 --> 1:20:42.092
- And I didn't even know
if it was going to fit.

1:20:42.133 --> 1:20:43.259
and then you helped
me zip it up.

1:20:43.301 --> 1:20:47.055
- You were absolutely
wonderful. (gasps)

1:20:47.097 --> 1:20:49.307
I couldn't be more proud.

1:20:49.349 --> 1:20:50.141
Look at you.

1:20:50.183 --> 1:20:51.935
You're just glowing, Maggie.

1:20:51.976 --> 1:20:54.979
You look so happy.

1:20:55.021 --> 1:20:58.149
- You called me, Maggie.

1:20:58.191 --> 1:20:59.526
- I know.

1:20:59.567 --> 1:21:01.277
I rather like it.

1:21:01.319 --> 1:21:02.362
- So do I.

1:21:03.863 --> 1:21:05.156
I can't believe you're here.

1:21:05.198 --> 1:21:07.826
- I came back to get
you to change your mind.

1:21:07.867 --> 1:21:09.202
- Mother-

1:21:09.244 --> 1:21:13.665
- But I made a new friend
and she changed mine.

1:21:13.707 --> 1:21:15.291
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

1:21:16.042 --> 1:21:17.335
I was so busy worrying

1:21:17.377 --> 1:21:19.004
about how it looked
to everyone else

1:21:19.045 --> 1:21:21.715
that I didn't give you
a chance to be yourself.

1:21:21.756 --> 1:21:25.260
And look at you.

1:21:26.136 --> 1:21:27.929
You followed your heart.

1:21:28.763 --> 1:21:30.974
And look what
you've accomplished.

1:21:31.016 --> 1:21:32.934
I'm so proud of you.

1:21:35.145 --> 1:21:36.479
- Father isn't here, is he?

1:21:36.521 --> 1:21:38.314
- Oh, he'll come around,

1:21:38.356 --> 1:21:39.024
don't worry,

1:21:39.065 --> 1:21:40.442
I'll make sure of it.

1:21:40.483 --> 1:21:43.319
I only let him think he's
in charge of this family.

1:21:44.237 --> 1:21:46.990
And I spoke to John
before the show.

1:21:48.074 --> 1:21:49.451
He's wonderful, Maggie.

1:21:50.535 --> 1:21:51.411
Don't let him go.

1:21:55.790 --> 1:21:56.958
- You were wonderful.

1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:58.668
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

1:22:00.378 --> 1:22:03.089
(Margaret chuckles)

1:22:03.131 --> 1:22:04.466
- You got the pin?

1:22:05.300 --> 1:22:08.345
- I can't believe
you did this.

1:22:08.386 --> 1:22:09.054
I love it.

1:22:09.095 --> 1:22:11.848
(gentle music)

1:22:11.890 --> 1:22:14.768
I'm so sorry about
what happened, John.

1:22:14.809 --> 1:22:16.186
I pressured you
to risk everything

1:22:16.227 --> 1:22:18.188
without telling you
the truth about myself.

1:22:18.229 --> 1:22:20.523
And I need you to know,

1:22:20.565 --> 1:22:21.900
I never meant to imply

1:22:21.941 --> 1:22:24.319
you couldn't make your
dreams come true on your own.

1:22:24.361 --> 1:22:26.946
- You have nothing
to apologize for.

1:22:26.988 --> 1:22:28.365
No one should have understood

1:22:28.406 --> 1:22:29.657
the kind of pressure you
were under from your family

1:22:29.699 --> 1:22:30.575
more than me.

1:22:32.494 --> 1:22:33.328
But

1:22:35.914 --> 1:22:38.500
it seems like you're
working things out.

1:22:38.541 --> 1:22:39.376
- I think so.

1:22:40.126 --> 1:22:42.128
How did our mothers even meet?

1:22:42.170 --> 1:22:43.922
- Long story short,

1:22:43.963 --> 1:22:46.800
they both wanted to
make things right.

1:22:46.841 --> 1:22:47.717
- And?

1:22:48.718 --> 1:22:50.011
- So far so good.

1:22:51.304 --> 1:22:53.598
- You want to see the
view I get every night?

1:22:54.849 --> 1:22:57.394
(both laughing)

1:22:57.435 --> 1:23:00.146
(gentle music)

1:23:03.149 --> 1:23:04.484
- It's beautiful.

1:23:04.526 --> 1:23:05.443
- Isn't it?

1:23:05.485 --> 1:23:07.737
Like Christmas
every single day.

1:23:07.779 --> 1:23:08.988
(John chuckles)

1:23:09.030 --> 1:23:10.740
- Actually, I was
talking about you.

1:23:13.868 --> 1:23:15.578
- You're not so bad yourself.

1:23:15.620 --> 1:23:17.163
(John chuckles)

1:23:17.205 --> 1:23:19.708
- I like to dress nice
for important occasions,

1:23:21.001 --> 1:23:23.545
like the night a man tells
a woman he loves her.

1:23:25.880 --> 1:23:27.090
There's no way I could
leave for six months

1:23:27.132 --> 1:23:28.550
without telling you that.

1:23:29.551 --> 1:23:31.344
- I love you, Maggie.

1:23:31.386 --> 1:23:33.513
(gentle music)

1:23:33.555 --> 1:23:34.931
(Margaret sighs)

1:23:34.973 --> 1:23:36.182
- I love you too.

1:23:37.642 --> 1:23:38.977
And when you get back,

1:23:39.019 --> 1:23:40.603
I'll be right here waiting.

1:23:40.645 --> 1:23:41.730
(John chuckles)

1:23:41.771 --> 1:23:43.273
- Even if you don't know

1:23:43.314 --> 1:23:45.859
if you're going to end up with
a photographer or a grocer?

1:23:45.900 --> 1:23:47.777
- I just want to be with you.

1:23:47.819 --> 1:23:50.530
(gentle music)

1:23:56.411 --> 1:24:00.457
- This pin always reminds
me of that Christmas

1:24:02.459 --> 1:24:07.672
and how I became the
woman I was meant to be.

1:24:10.133 --> 1:24:12.886
And I became a
lot stronger too.

1:24:12.927 --> 1:24:15.138
Lucy, just like you,
you can do this.

1:24:16.681 --> 1:24:18.391
- Thank you, Grandma.

1:24:18.433 --> 1:24:22.604
- I should have known this
is where you snuck off to.

1:24:25.023 --> 1:24:26.483
- Look what Grandma gave me.

1:24:26.524 --> 1:24:31.446
- Oh, well, I can't think of
a better legacy. (chuckles)

1:24:32.030 --> 1:24:35.200
(gentle music continues)

1:24:35.241 --> 1:24:38.411
And it all started right here.

1:24:38.453 --> 1:24:42.207
- The happiest night
of my entire life.

1:24:42.248 --> 1:24:45.126
(dreamy music)

1:25:06.147 --> 1:25:08.817
(lively music)
