00:01.043 --> 00:04.671
<i>Kids, it's no secret
your Uncle Barney is a bit of a dog,</i>

00:04.755 --> 00:07.549
<i>and even though he loved me,
I think he always wanted</i>

00:07.633 --> 00:09.468
<i>a wingman who was
a bit of a dog, too.</i>

00:16.433 --> 00:18.727
<i>And in the fall of 2012...</i>

00:20.479 --> 00:22.397
<i>he found one.</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:23.774
Respect.

00:43.210 --> 00:47.047
Hey, guys, thanks again
for a great night last night.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.508
I say again,

00:49.508 --> 00:51.969
great night.

00:51.969 --> 00:55.389
Ted, honey, it was
not a great night.

00:55.389 --> 00:56.849
Ted,

00:56.849 --> 00:59.768
Lily and I noticed
some things last night.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.271
- Hey, Ted, can you pass me a cracker?
- Yeah.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.982
It's the least you can do, considering
I left a guy at the altar for you.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.568
Right, right?

01:09.528 --> 01:11.989
Oh, come on, that was a joke.

01:11.989 --> 01:15.826
Women over 30 don't joke
when it comes to commitment.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.579
Victoria is happy
we're taking things slow.

01:19.872 --> 01:22.165
Oh, oh, honeysweetiebaby,

01:22.249 --> 01:24.001
no 32-year-old woman

01:24.001 --> 01:26.295
- is happy taking things slow.
- Mm.

01:26.295 --> 01:29.047
Trust me, Victoria has got
friends from high school

01:29.131 --> 01:31.175
posting pictures
of second babies on Facebook.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.676
- Mm-hmm.
- And you think girlfriend's

01:32.676 --> 01:34.761
all like, "Oh,
let's just bone a bunch

01:34.845 --> 01:36.763
so I'm another year older
and still single"?

01:36.847 --> 01:38.473
- Bitch, please.
- Mm.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.728
Guys, I've got a new bro,

01:42.728 --> 01:45.731
a bro that puts
all other bros to shame.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.357
The bitches love him.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.777
He buries bones all day.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.529
Whoo!

01:52.613 --> 01:55.115
No one chases
tail like him.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.535
Why aren't you
guys laughing?

01:58.619 --> 02:01.580
Oh, wait, I probably
should have led with this: he's a dog.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.249
I've named him

02:04.333 --> 02:05.918
Brover.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.252
I'll go...

02:07.336 --> 02:08.837
...fetch him.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.091
Okay, I'm worried about Barney.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.136
That breakup with Quinn messed
him up more than he let on.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.388
I think he's lonely.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.057
Dude seems fine to me.

02:20.057 --> 02:23.268
I love you so much, Brover.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.442
Seriously, based on last night,

02:30.526 --> 02:32.778
you and Victoria
are headed for trouble.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.239
So I got this kind of
interesting job offer

02:35.239 --> 02:37.282
to run a bakery in Denver.

02:37.366 --> 02:39.701
But that's too crazy,
though, right?

02:39.785 --> 02:40.869
Right?

02:40.953 --> 02:42.079
Uh, yeah.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.748
The high altitude would affect
the density of the pastries.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.376
I mean,
talk about half-baked.

02:47.376 --> 02:50.671
Man, this is
a great night.

02:50.671 --> 02:54.258
That was Victoria asking you
to move to Denver with her.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.425
What?

02:55.509 --> 02:57.511
Then, why wouldn't
she just come right out

02:57.511 --> 02:58.679
and say what she wants?

02:58.679 --> 02:59.847
Men.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.432
It's like, if there weren't
pickle jars to open

03:02.516 --> 03:03.725
and spiders
to kill

03:03.809 --> 03:06.103
and computers to back up,
what would be their point?

03:06.103 --> 03:07.396
Mm-hmm.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.110
Okay, when did Marshall become
a slightly more feminine you?

03:13.110 --> 03:16.488
Look, Ted, it gets exhausting
constantly giving people

03:16.572 --> 03:19.908
advice they haven't asked for,
so I'm training Marshall.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.828
My goal is
to eventually say things

03:22.828 --> 03:25.372
that are so sassy
and wise,

03:25.372 --> 03:28.125
that there is
no possible response

03:28.125 --> 03:31.503
other than "mm"
or "mm-hmm."

03:31.587 --> 03:33.422
And if this is a place where
we can share our dreams...

03:33.422 --> 03:34.715
I like to think
that it is...

03:34.715 --> 03:38.886
I hope someday
to earn a...

03:38.886 --> 03:40.762
"testify."

03:41.805 --> 03:44.016
Look, Victoria and I are five months in

03:44.016 --> 03:45.517
and we're
right where we should be.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.477
All right, we-we're cosigning
birthday cards,

03:47.561 --> 03:49.771
w-we got toothbrushes
at each other's places,

03:49.855 --> 03:51.023
foreplay's out the window.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.609
I'm in, I'm out,
I'm sleeping, it's great.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.110
It's more than
five months.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.905
You guys dated before;
that time counts.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.157
The clock doesn't
reset to zero.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.242
It un-pauses from
where you left off.

04:02.326 --> 04:03.410
No way,

04:03.410 --> 04:04.828
no way, the clock resets.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.040
Wait, so this is what you guys do?

04:08.040 --> 04:09.583
You invite other couples
over for dinner

04:09.583 --> 04:11.460
to judge them and feel superior?

04:11.460 --> 04:13.170
Oh, grow up, Ted,

04:13.170 --> 04:16.256
that's why any couple
invites anyone over ever.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.344
Two Scotches, both neat,

04:20.344 --> 04:23.305
and if you've got some, uh,
nuts, this guy lost a couple.

04:23.305 --> 04:24.598
Ha-ha.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.266
Take the hit, just take the hit.

04:27.684 --> 04:29.478
Okay, this is a cry for help.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.147
Can we invite Barney over
for dinner tonight?

04:32.231 --> 04:34.274
But I was going to make you
a special meal to celebrate

04:34.358 --> 04:36.985
my show getting nominated
for a Local Area Media Award.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.695
<i>Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention,</i>

04:38.779 --> 04:41.073
<i>Nick had
a cable access cooking show.</i>

04:41.073 --> 04:43.408
<i>Chef Nick Podarutti uses</i>

04:43.492 --> 04:46.620
<i>all fresh,
locally grown ingredients,</i>

04:46.620 --> 04:48.789
<i>but don't think for a second</i>

04:48.789 --> 04:51.625
<i>that means he's not a bad boy.</i>

04:51.625 --> 04:54.169
She runs on corn.

04:56.296 --> 05:00.300
<i>Nick the Bad Boy Chef...</i>

05:03.846 --> 05:05.597
I'm gonna invite him over
for dinner.

05:05.681 --> 05:10.018
Okay, fine, but you'd better
make sure he has a ticket.

05:10.102 --> 05:14.690
'Cause it's all aboard
the Chow-Chow Train!

05:14.690 --> 05:18.235
Honey, I know
it's hard coming up

05:18.235 --> 05:20.237
with a signature
cooking catchphrase,

05:20.237 --> 05:22.406
but I don't think that's it.

05:22.406 --> 05:25.158
I know, but how do you compete
with "Bam!"?

05:25.242 --> 05:27.077
It just says it all.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.163
Hey, you.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.875
Hey, can I ask you
something?

05:32.875 --> 05:35.544
Um, Lily and Marshall think

05:35.544 --> 05:38.255
I'm missing all these hints
you're dropping

05:38.255 --> 05:40.299
that you want
a deeper commitment.

05:40.299 --> 05:42.885
I mean, you'd just come
right out and tell me, right?

05:42.885 --> 05:44.052
Totally.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.805
I-I think I can be a little
bit more direct than that.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.432
Thank you.

05:48.432 --> 05:52.227
Oh, hey, I was cleaning
my apartment today

05:52.311 --> 05:55.272
and I dug this up.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.440
Should I keep

05:56.440 --> 05:57.941
this wedding dress,
or do you think

05:58.025 --> 05:59.943
I'll never, ever need it again?

06:04.823 --> 06:07.284
So Lily and Marshall
were right?

06:07.284 --> 06:08.535
Of course they're right.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.913
When a girl jumps in your
car in a wedding dress,

06:10.913 --> 06:12.122
you can't act
surprised to find out

06:12.206 --> 06:13.457
she wants to get married.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.293
Besides, we dated before,
and that time counts.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.086
We just hit pause
on the clock.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.671
See, a lot
of really smart people

06:19.755 --> 06:21.048
would argue the clock resets.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.300
It un-pauses,
everybody knows that.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.801
You know, Barney's
a little late.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.553
- I hope he's okay.
- Ah, he's fine,

06:26.637 --> 06:28.472
and I still don't think
he's crying out for help.

06:28.472 --> 06:30.933
Well...

06:34.186 --> 06:36.396
Sorry we're late.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.773
We just came from the tailor.

06:37.773 --> 06:40.150
Brover couldn't settle on a tie,
so I just bought them all.

06:40.234 --> 06:41.985
You say no to that face.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.699
There's a reason
that you're not

06:47.783 --> 06:50.702
a hundred percent in
this with me, Ted.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.621
Something's holding us back.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.122
Well, what is it?

06:54.206 --> 06:55.832
I think we've established
I'm not great

06:55.916 --> 06:59.628
at picking up on clues...
Well, in this situation.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.965
As a kid, I was known
as a bit of a detective.

07:02.965 --> 07:05.342
In fact, when my friend's retainer
went missing,

07:05.342 --> 07:07.553
the Mosby Boys were put
on the case, and it was...

07:07.553 --> 07:09.388
The retainer was
in the garbage.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.348
The Mosby Boys were
you, your sister,

07:11.348 --> 07:13.934
and a neighborhood squirrel
you thought you had tamed.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.937
I can't believe Squirrel-lock
Holmes turned on us like that.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.564
Eight weeks of training
down the drain.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.774
You know how I
know that, Ted?

07:20.858 --> 07:23.110
Because we covered it in the
"getting to know you" part

07:23.110 --> 07:26.029
of the relationship
six years ago.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.198
Six years.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.871
Then...
what's holding us back?

07:35.455 --> 07:38.083
Call in the
Mosby Boys, Ted,

07:38.083 --> 07:39.710
let me know if they
crack the case.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.466
Guys,

07:46.550 --> 07:49.887
Brover is not only
the best bro I've ever had,

07:49.887 --> 07:52.389
he's amazing with the ladies.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.516
I'm sorry, don't you think
it's a little pathetic

07:54.600 --> 07:56.310
to use a dog to pick up chicks?

07:56.310 --> 07:59.688
Sir, wingmanship is
a two-way street.

07:59.688 --> 08:03.400
<i>If Brover meets a cutie,
I'll take the hit</i>

08:03.400 --> 08:06.570
<i>and chat up
the chubby lady friend.</i>

08:10.490 --> 08:13.202
<i>Sometimes I'll be the jerk...</i>

08:13.202 --> 08:16.914
<i>...so Brover can swoop in
and be the hero.</i>

08:16.914 --> 08:18.916
<i>And like any good wingman,</i>

08:18.916 --> 08:21.710
<i>I gather as much intel
as I can right up front.</i>

08:21.710 --> 08:22.920
How old's your dog?

08:22.920 --> 08:25.214
- She's five.
- Oh.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.423
What's that in dog years?

08:26.507 --> 08:28.509
- Like, 35.
- We're done here.

08:30.594 --> 08:31.720
Well, you were right.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.680
Victoria says something's
holding us back,

08:33.764 --> 08:35.849
and I don't have
any idea what it is.

08:35.933 --> 08:37.643
Any brilliant insights, Oprah?

08:37.643 --> 08:38.894
Steadman?

08:38.894 --> 08:40.938
Um, try Gayle.

08:42.314 --> 08:45.526
Marshall, I want you
to take this one.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.362
- You're ready.
- Oh, I don't know.

08:50.364 --> 08:53.158
Although I do hear this little
voice in the back of my head

08:53.242 --> 08:55.160
trying to tell me something.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.912
That's your inner goddess.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.830
Listen to her,
channel her.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.168
If Victoria quenches your thirst

09:03.252 --> 09:07.965
like a tall glass of sweet tea
on a hot July day...

09:07.965 --> 09:09.132
Marshall, why is she Southern?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.717
Don't let him break
the connection.

09:10.801 --> 09:13.220
...well, you
got to make an honest woman out of her.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.388
Okay, I'm leaving.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.181
But, but,

09:16.265 --> 09:20.853
if not, well,
then, sugar...

09:20.853 --> 09:22.729
you got to let
that nightingale

09:22.813 --> 09:26.775
spread her
wings and soar

09:26.859 --> 09:28.068
to her own

09:28.068 --> 09:30.487
beautiful tomorrow.

09:30.571 --> 09:32.573
Testify.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.868
You guys are the worst.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.127
Where am I?

09:47.880 --> 09:50.007
Sorry.

09:50.007 --> 09:52.509
Uh, go for Barney.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.052
Uh-huh.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.222
I see.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.057
Totally understood.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.144
I'll do that.

10:02.144 --> 10:03.312
Great.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.105
Thank you.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.983
That was Brover's owner.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.526
I guess,
while she was

10:09.610 --> 10:11.320
out of town, he ran
away from his kennel,

10:11.320 --> 10:14.489
and now that she's back,
I have to return him.

10:15.699 --> 10:17.075
Oh, Barney, I'm so sorry.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.327
Oh, it's all good.

10:18.327 --> 10:21.038
Um, excuse me for one moment.

10:35.636 --> 10:36.762
Hey,

10:36.762 --> 10:38.096
Barney.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.309
- No, no.
- No, no!

10:45.771 --> 10:47.648
Oh.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.652
Wha...

10:54.238 --> 10:55.948
Victoria.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.744
Will you marry me?

11:00.744 --> 11:03.622
Yes, of course.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.711
There's just one thing.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.338
Anything. You name it.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.050
You can't be friends with Robin.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.099
You won't marry me

11:22.099 --> 11:24.434
if I'm still friends with Robin?

11:24.518 --> 11:27.229
Wait. She's the thing
that's been holding us back?

11:27.229 --> 11:29.815
There-There's just too much
history there.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.775
I mean, Robin's the reason
that we broke up

11:31.859 --> 11:34.278
the first time around.
Robin's our roadblock.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.405
Robin's the deep, dark pit

11:36.405 --> 11:38.991
where our relationship
goes to die.

11:38.991 --> 11:41.493
But nicest girl in the world.
Salt of the earth.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.078
But she's with Nick now.

11:43.078 --> 11:45.080
I mean, sure,
his cooking show is lousy

11:45.080 --> 11:47.040
with awkward
catchphrase attempts.

11:47.124 --> 11:50.252
Oh, my gosh,
who's ready to nosh?

11:50.252 --> 11:52.629
Who's popping a chub
for some grub?

11:55.465 --> 11:57.050
I offer my deepest apologies

11:57.134 --> 12:00.095
to anyone who was offended
by my "popping a chub" remark.

12:00.179 --> 12:01.763
I can and will do better.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.265
Won't happen again.

12:03.265 --> 12:06.226
And now who's ready
to eat my meat?

12:06.310 --> 12:08.854
Oh, come on.

12:08.854 --> 12:11.064
But Robin's happy with Nick,

12:11.148 --> 12:13.734
and I'm happy with you.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.653
Look, I, I just asked you to be my wife.

12:16.737 --> 12:19.656
Isn't that proof there's nothing
between me and Robin?

12:19.740 --> 12:21.325
Well, maybe today there isn't,

12:21.325 --> 12:22.868
but what about tomorrow?

12:22.868 --> 12:25.871
Or next week
or 15 years from now?

12:25.871 --> 12:28.624
I'll always be wondering.

12:28.624 --> 12:32.294
I never wanted to be that girl who says

12:32.294 --> 12:34.046
it's Robin or it's me,

12:34.046 --> 12:37.132
but, well...

12:37.216 --> 12:39.885
It's Robin or it's you.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.889
You've been
a hell of a wingman.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.266
And even though I think
it's kind of gross

12:46.350 --> 12:48.185
when you
pleasure yourself orally,

12:48.185 --> 12:51.563
don't ever think
that means I'm not impressed.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.192
Hey...

12:55.192 --> 12:57.236
do you think that Barney's
gonna be okay

12:57.236 --> 12:59.530
- bringing Brover back?
- Yeah, he'll be fine.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.866
It's not just the ability
to go to town on yourself,

13:02.950 --> 13:06.078
but you do it with
such joie de vivre.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.040
I really think
that I should go with him.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.667
No, but you got
to eat these crêpes

13:11.667 --> 13:13.043
as soon as
they're flambéed.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.963
They're gonna be
bon appe-sweet!

13:15.963 --> 13:17.589
- No.
- Damn.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.007
We'll work on it
when I get back.

13:19.091 --> 13:20.551
No, I get it.
You know,

13:20.551 --> 13:21.718
I only spent all night
working on these,

13:21.802 --> 13:23.011
but, hey, Barney's
more important.

13:23.095 --> 13:25.889
- Nick...
- It's fine. Go.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.101
Anyway, let's not make
a big deal of it.

13:29.101 --> 13:30.853
We hung out for a few days,

13:30.853 --> 13:32.312
had some fun...

13:32.396 --> 13:34.314
no big woof.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.819
I don't know who I am without you.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.115
This is crazy.

13:43.115 --> 13:46.493
Victoria is being completely unreasonable
about Robin,

13:46.577 --> 13:48.412
and my snap sister
is gonna back me up.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.292
I say again...

13:55.002 --> 13:57.754
I kind of see Victoria's point.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.214
Come again for Ms. Fudge?

13:59.298 --> 14:01.675
Ted and Robin have
so much history.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.553
Exactly. History.
Ancient history.

14:04.553 --> 14:08.473
Ted, you said "I love you"
to her earlier this year.

14:08.557 --> 14:12.352
I'm not saying this is fair,
but I get it.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.855
I didn't get that at all.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.192
How could my inner goddess
be so far off?

14:18.192 --> 14:19.776
Oh, you'll get there, honey.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.820
Oprah wasn't built in a day.

14:23.405 --> 14:26.116
- Uh-oh.
- What?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.577
I kind of went rogue.

14:28.577 --> 14:31.121
Look, if you really want
to have a baby,

14:31.205 --> 14:32.831
just stop taking the pill.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.875
You guys slept together
at spring break

14:34.875 --> 14:36.919
three years ago.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.837
That means something.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.631
Loves show tunes,

14:40.631 --> 14:42.424
total shopaholic,

14:42.508 --> 14:44.635
not always pestering you
for sex?

14:44.635 --> 14:47.054
Um, Clifford
sounds like a keeper.

14:48.472 --> 14:51.225
Marshall, all of that advice
was terrible.

14:51.225 --> 14:52.684
Not as terrible as you saying

14:52.768 --> 14:54.353
that Ted and Robin
should stop being friends.

14:54.353 --> 14:57.689
I'm not saying they should.
It would be horrible.

14:57.773 --> 15:01.109
But if Ted really wants to be
with Victoria...

15:02.277 --> 15:04.112
Ted, tell her

15:04.196 --> 15:06.406
that you're not gonna
stop being friends with Robin.

15:08.242 --> 15:10.661
I can't imagine
life without Robin.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.248
But she'll never be
in love with me.

15:14.248 --> 15:16.083
She'll never be my wife.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.920
She'll never be the person
I grow old with.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.882
Victoria...

15:23.966 --> 15:25.467
Victoria could be.

15:26.844 --> 15:29.638
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.483
You ready to say good-bye?

15:43.944 --> 15:45.445
Thanks for coming with me.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.489
Oh, well,
you did the same for me

15:47.573 --> 15:50.242
back when I had to give away
all my dogs. Remember?

15:50.242 --> 15:53.579
Oh, yeah, we drove
to your aunt's farm upstate.

15:53.579 --> 15:54.746
- She was awesome.
- Yeah.

15:54.830 --> 15:57.165
I love how she was this wise,
old, chilled out,

15:57.249 --> 15:59.543
lesbian farmer.

15:59.543 --> 16:01.879
No, no, no.
She's not a lesbian.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.172
Nor does she farm them.

16:03.172 --> 16:05.591
No, that woman
she lives with,

16:05.591 --> 16:06.884
that's just
her special friend Maureen.

16:06.884 --> 16:09.845
They've lived together for...

16:09.845 --> 16:11.471
Oh.

16:13.265 --> 16:16.602
Oh, this is gonna be tough.

16:16.602 --> 16:19.354
Brover really was
the best wingman ever.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.113
Oh, my God.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.032
Thank you so much for bringing

16:30.032 --> 16:32.743
- Mr. Sprinkles back.
- Mr. Sprinkles...

16:32.743 --> 16:34.953
is a great name for a dog.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.247
Mommy missed you so much.

16:37.331 --> 16:38.457
Yes, she did.

16:38.457 --> 16:41.460
Did this nice couple
take care of you?

16:44.338 --> 16:45.756
That's a laugh. Ha.

16:45.756 --> 16:48.050
Big bro.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.219
I got to split.
Yeah, I got to,

16:50.219 --> 16:51.970
I got to head back
to the farm...

16:52.054 --> 16:55.807
where I live with my
special friend Maureen.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.184
Whom I now realize

16:57.184 --> 17:00.395
is my lesbian
life partner.

17:00.479 --> 17:01.980
Surprise.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.024
Okay. All right.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.109
So...

17:06.193 --> 17:07.903
would you like a drink?

17:11.657 --> 17:14.117
Best wingman ever.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.958
Hey.

17:20.958 --> 17:22.584
What's all this?

17:22.668 --> 17:24.378
I thought you were
mad at me.

17:24.378 --> 17:25.879
I was...

17:25.963 --> 17:27.381
but then I realized

17:27.381 --> 17:30.133
I just have to accept
that you have close guy friends.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.094
I mean, I don't want it
becoming a habit

17:32.094 --> 17:34.263
that they steal you away from me
in the middle of the night.

17:34.263 --> 17:35.848
But...

17:35.848 --> 17:37.224
Oh, sorry.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.853
Oh, Ted needs to see me.

17:40.853 --> 17:42.437
Oh, for the love of God, woman.

17:42.521 --> 17:44.731
Oh, it's not what you think.
He just wants to have sex.

17:44.815 --> 17:47.025
Kidding.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.152
Just a little hand stuff.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.320
Ha. Kidding again.

17:50.404 --> 17:53.615
Ted's more of a boob man.
I seriously can't stop.

17:53.699 --> 17:56.410
- What does he want?
- Um...

17:56.410 --> 17:59.955
I don't know,
but he says it's urgent.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.707
I'm so sorry.

18:01.707 --> 18:03.667
Just one more little
steal-away.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.711
Just as long
as he gives you back.

18:07.379 --> 18:08.630
Thanks.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.690
<i>I wanna sit you down and talk</i>

18:26.690 --> 18:27.858
So...

18:27.858 --> 18:29.651
are you okay?

18:29.735 --> 18:31.862
What is this big, urgent thing

18:31.862 --> 18:33.530
that couldn't wait
till tomorrow?

18:35.407 --> 18:37.367
There's something
I have to tell you.

18:37.451 --> 18:40.037
Um...

18:40.037 --> 18:41.955
I've thought about this a ton,

18:42.039 --> 18:45.042
and, um...

18:45.042 --> 18:47.711
I was hoping it wouldn't
come to this,

18:47.711 --> 18:49.171
but...

18:53.133 --> 18:55.177
I'm not in love with Robin, um...

18:57.471 --> 19:01.016
but she's like family to me,
and, uh...

19:01.016 --> 19:02.851
I can't end that.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.436
So...

19:05.687 --> 19:07.397
can you accept that?

19:16.782 --> 19:19.618
I really hope
you get her some day.

19:35.676 --> 19:36.927
Hey, guys.

19:36.927 --> 19:38.053
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.222
So, last night

19:40.222 --> 19:44.893
Ted calls me out to the bar
to talk about something urgent.

19:44.977 --> 19:46.478
Guess what it was.

19:46.562 --> 19:47.646
He wants to write

19:47.646 --> 19:50.858
a series of young adult
mystery novels

19:50.858 --> 19:53.944
called <i>The Mosby Boys.</i>

19:53.944 --> 19:55.654
Why did you need
to tell me that?

19:55.654 --> 19:58.073
You work in the media.
You know people.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.325
Okay, well, first of all,
lose the Mosby nerds

20:00.409 --> 20:02.119
and focus on
that crime-solving squirrel.

20:02.119 --> 20:03.662
- That guy is gold.
- Yeah.

20:03.662 --> 20:04.746
And secondly, next time

20:04.830 --> 20:06.248
you have a big idea
late at night,

20:06.248 --> 20:08.083
please bug
your girlfriend about it.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.710
Uh, actually...

20:09.710 --> 20:11.879
Victoria and I broke up.

20:11.879 --> 20:13.255
Oh, my God.

20:14.298 --> 20:16.592
Why, what,
what happened?

20:16.592 --> 20:19.970
We just, you know,
wanted different things.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.600
I'm so sorry, buddy.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.643
But, bright side...

20:26.727 --> 20:28.562
Robin is gonna be so touched

20:28.562 --> 20:31.231
when she hears you ended things
with Victoria because of her.

20:31.315 --> 20:32.900
She can never know.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.819
Promise me
Robin will never find out.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.029
I don't understand.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.156
Promise.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.658
- Promise.
- Promise.

20:41.742 --> 20:45.078
<i>Of course, Robin did find out.</i>

20:45.162 --> 20:46.580
<i>But we'll get to that.</i>

21:02.638 --> 21:04.598
So you do have balls?

21:06.767 --> 21:07.976
Run!
