about something.

02:03.690 --> 02:07.693
Well, what? The only thing
she could be upset about

02:07.694 --> 02:09.695
was that one night
I didn't come home,

02:09.696 --> 02:12.197
and we talked about that
and everything was fine.

02:12.198 --> 02:16.201

She's... She left.

Bob, be serious.

I am serious.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.231
I loved that jacket.

02:46.232 --> 02:50.235
Yeah, but see,
we all lost people,

02:50.236 --> 02:52.738
and people can't be replaced.

02:52.739 --> 02:57.242
Well, I can't replace
that jacket!

I wouldn't mind losing Bob.

Oh, don't mind him, Burt.
He's drunk.

03:27.273 --> 03:31.777
You see,
what happens in life is this.

03:31.778 --> 03:34.279
Something bad happens to you
and you say, "Oh, God.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.783
Look at this bad thing
that just happened to me."

03:37.784 --> 03:40.786
Then you figure it's over
and it will all get good again,

03:40.787 --> 03:43.288
but then what happens is...

03:43.289 --> 03:44.790
another bad thing happens

03:44.791 --> 03:47.794
and then you say,
"Pfft! That was a surprise."

two bad things in a row,

of bad."

03:55.301 --> 03:56.802
And then

03:56.803 --> 03:58.303
what happens is

03:58.304 --> 04:01.306
some awful thing happens to you,

04:01.307 --> 04:05.811
like everything gets taken away
from you,

"Pfft! Well, that's it.

its funny trick...

Life is unfair to do that.

"I never throw up"?

05:11.377 --> 05:13.879
I never... throw up.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.383
Throwing up is not a choice.

You don't say,

05:19.385 --> 05:21.386
"I'm sorry, I don't play tennis,

05:21.387 --> 05:23.889
and I don't throw up."

to find my car.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.290
Oh, Ma.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.792
Eunice!

20:27.793 --> 20:28.793
Dutch was caught.

20:28.794 --> 20:30.795
Doing what?

20:30.796 --> 20:32.797
At the cabin.

20:32.798 --> 20:33.798
The police came,

20:33.799 --> 20:35.299
and they surrounded the place,

20:35.300 --> 20:36.300
and they took him to jail,

20:36.301 --> 20:37.802
and they wouldn't
let me see him.

20:37.803 --> 20:38.803
Aw...

20:38.804 --> 20:40.805
Billy, go up to Eunice's room,

20:40.806 --> 20:42.306
get Aunt Mary's bags

20:42.307 --> 20:43.808
and take them to my room,

20:43.809 --> 20:45.810
and then come down
and get Eunice's bags

20:45.811 --> 20:47.813
and take them up to her room.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.823
Benson, set another place
for breakfast.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.324
You don't want to eat, do you?

21:00.325 --> 21:02.326
Yes, I do.
I'm upset.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.328
I always eat when I'm upset.

21:04.329 --> 21:05.830
I eat when I'm happy.

21:05.831 --> 21:07.331
I eat then too.

21:07.332 --> 21:08.332
I'd love to eat.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.835
Don't hold your breath.

21:10.836 --> 21:12.837
Ma?

21:12.838 --> 21:14.338
Oh, look.

21:14.339 --> 21:16.340
Corinne's come out of her room.

21:16.341 --> 21:19.844
Ma, I think something's wrong.

21:19.845 --> 21:20.845
What, dear?

21:20.846 --> 21:23.347
Look.

21:23.348 --> 21:25.850
Yes, you're pregnant.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.351
Don't worry.

21:27.352 --> 21:30.354
I'll find the soldier
who's responsible.

21:30.355 --> 21:33.858
But I'm only six weeks pregnant.

21:33.859 --> 21:35.359
Maybe it's twins.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.362
Maybe it's an elephant.

21:39.364 --> 21:40.865
I called the doctor,
and she said

21:40.866 --> 21:42.867
that I should meet her
at the hospital.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.368
Okay. Billy,

21:44.369 --> 21:46.370
go to Corinne's room,
get her bag,

21:46.371 --> 21:47.872
and put it in the car,

21:47.873 --> 21:50.875
then go to my room
and take Aunt Mary's bags

21:50.876 --> 21:52.116
and put them in Corinne's room.

22:00.385 --> 22:02.887
Benson, set another
place for breakfast.

22:02.888 --> 22:05.890
If she's going to the hospital,
she doesn't need to eat.

22:05.891 --> 22:07.892
Yes, I do.
I'm starving.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.894
But you had breakfast earlier.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.896
I know that,
but I'm still hungry.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.397
Well, maybe you're not pregnant.

22:13.398 --> 22:14.899
Maybe you're just fat.

22:17.402 --> 22:18.903
Forget the breakfast.

22:18.904 --> 22:19.904
Good.

22:19.905 --> 22:20.905
I'm going into labor.

22:20.906 --> 22:21.906
When?

22:21.907 --> 22:23.407
Oh, now.
Now?

22:23.408 --> 22:24.909
Medic!

22:24.910 --> 22:26.911
Right here, now,
in the dining room?

22:26.912 --> 22:27.912
Yeah.

22:27.913 --> 22:30.414
Oh, well, now, okay.
Don't panic.

22:30.415 --> 22:33.417
Everybody, just stay calm.
Just stay calm, now.

22:33.418 --> 22:35.419
What... what, uh, what...
do you have...

22:35.420 --> 22:36.921
Where's the... where's the car?

22:36.922 --> 22:37.922
The car! The car!

22:37.923 --> 22:39.423
It's in the garage, Benson.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.425
Where's the garage?
Get the keys.

22:41.426 --> 22:43.427
Get away. Get away.
Stop. Let's go.

22:43.428 --> 22:44.929
Who's got the keys?

22:59.945 --> 23:02.446
<i>Will Danny find happiness</i>
<i>without Elaine?</i>

23:02.447 --> 23:03.948

23:03.949 --> 23:05.950

<i>and her killers?</i>

23:05.951 --> 23:07.952

23:07.953 --> 23:09.453
<i>Will Tim find a cave?</i>

23:09.454 --> 23:12.456
<i>And if he finds one,</i>

<i>Now that Jodie and Alice</i>

23:14.459 --> 23:16.460

23:16.461 --> 23:17.962

23:17.963 --> 23:18.963

23:18.964 --> 23:20.965

23:20.966 --> 23:22.466
