("Careless Whisper"
by George Michael playing)

00:06.881 --> 00:09.686
(door opens, bell jingles)

00:09.686 --> 00:11.389
Hey.

00:11.389 --> 00:12.893
Thanks for coming out.
I know this is a little bit

00:12.893 --> 00:15.865
out of the way, but I am,
uh, finally one punch away

00:15.865 --> 00:17.234
from a free cruller, so...

00:17.234 --> 00:18.504
What is this?

00:18.504 --> 00:20.909
This is my frequent holer card.
I've been a member since 2008.

00:20.909 --> 00:22.478
It's a great program.
You just...

00:22.478 --> 00:23.648
I mean, why are you here?

00:23.648 --> 00:27.321
Ah. I am here
to negotiate

00:27.321 --> 00:29.560
for my client's testimony.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.730
I am Flaco Ruiz's
new legal counsel,

00:31.730 --> 00:33.834
Leo Getz.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.805
You can keep that.

00:35.805 --> 00:39.646
Now, we are
asking the DEA for...

00:41.215 --> 00:42.552
immunity,

00:42.552 --> 00:45.592
witness relocation in
the city of his choosing‐‐

00:45.592 --> 00:47.529
nowhere smoggy,
he's legitimately bronchial‐‐

00:47.529 --> 00:48.864
a one million dollar

00:48.864 --> 00:52.872
relocation bonus, and
coverage of his legal fees,

00:52.872 --> 00:56.379
which are substantial.

00:56.379 --> 00:58.383
This is not
a negotiation.

00:58.383 --> 01:01.189
Well, everything
is a negotiation.

01:01.189 --> 01:02.626
Shall we say $500,000

01:02.626 --> 01:04.529
and coverage
of his legal fees?

01:07.468 --> 01:09.506
$100,000 and he will
live in Fresno?

01:09.506 --> 01:12.512
The DEA is prepared
to offer one thing.

01:12.512 --> 01:14.850
Coverage of
his legal fees‐‐ sold.

01:14.850 --> 01:17.354
Protection from having
his fingers hacked off

01:17.354 --> 01:19.492
and shoved into his
mouth by the cartel.

01:24.536 --> 01:26.640
(whispering)

01:30.581 --> 01:32.952
Throw in a dozen crullers,
and you got a deal.

01:35.792 --> 01:38.664
Half of those are mine.
My fee.

01:38.664 --> 01:41.503
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

01:41.503 --> 01:45.645
I need to see a judge
about a release. Huh?

01:58.504 --> 02:00.842
Should have made it
two dozen crullers.

02:00.842 --> 02:02.645
AGENT:
Get down! Get down!

02:02.645 --> 02:03.914

Leo screams)

02:03.914 --> 02:05.417

02:08.791 --> 02:10.895

tires screeching)

02:24.388 --> 02:25.758
(stammers)

02:25.758 --> 02:27.695
(gasps)

02:37.782 --> 02:40.420
(panting)

02:40.420 --> 02:42.525

02:44.763 --> 02:46.767
MURTAUGH:
<i>Big day, big breakfast.</i>

02:46.767 --> 02:49.506
My woman makes managing partner.

02:49.506 --> 02:50.575
I hope you're hungry.

02:50.575 --> 02:53.581
Do I look hungry?

02:53.581 --> 02:55.818
Damn. Maybe not for breakfast.

02:55.818 --> 02:57.487
(giggles)

02:57.487 --> 02:59.826
That is the idea.

02:59.826 --> 03:01.730
Hmm?
It's so beautiful,
thank you.

03:01.730 --> 03:05.538
The‐‐ And the bow
and everything, honey?

03:05.538 --> 03:07.542
But I have to head over
to the office

03:07.542 --> 03:09.011
to get some stuff done
before the partners

03:09.011 --> 03:11.415
announce the promotion.
I'm sorry.

03:11.415 --> 03:13.319
Hey... it's okay.
You know what?

03:13.319 --> 03:16.793
I'll, uh, I'll just
enjoy it all in your honor.

03:16.793 --> 03:19.031
You can eat the bacon, baby.

03:19.031 --> 03:21.068
I have a new plan

03:21.068 --> 03:23.574
to lower your cholesterol.

03:23.574 --> 03:25.678
Well, if it involves
eating pork,

03:25.678 --> 03:26.747
you have my attention.

03:26.747 --> 03:29.686
No, it does not
involve eating pork.

03:29.686 --> 03:32.825
<i>We</i> are putting in a pool

03:32.825 --> 03:34.696
with a resistance
training feature.

03:34.696 --> 03:37.802
Isn't that a... little pricey?

03:37.802 --> 03:39.038
We can afford it now, baby.

03:39.038 --> 03:43.079
Hey, Trish, why don't,
why don't, why don't we just

03:43.079 --> 03:45.685
put the bonus money
into our retirement fund?

03:45.685 --> 03:47.487
Or we could put it
into the college...

03:47.487 --> 03:48.423
Baby, I'm gonna ask you

03:48.423 --> 03:50.493
to do something for me
that goes against

03:50.493 --> 03:52.497
every fiber
of your being.

03:52.497 --> 03:54.970
(whispers):
Don't worry so much.

03:54.970 --> 03:56.807
Me, worry?

03:56.807 --> 03:58.443
Not possible.
(laughs)

03:58.443 --> 03:59.646
I love you.

03:59.646 --> 04:02.552
You enjoy today.
You earned it.

04:04.589 --> 04:06.626
SCORSESE:
Morning, gentlemen.

04:06.626 --> 04:08.864
Scorsizzle.
What do we got?

04:08.864 --> 04:10.935
Three dead by gunfire,
approximately 5:00 a. m.,

04:10.935 --> 04:13.106
including DEA agent
Daniel Zigman.

04:13.106 --> 04:14.843
The pattern and volume
of brass from the ground

04:14.843 --> 04:17.715
suggests a nine‐millimeter
submachine gun.

04:17.715 --> 04:20.120
Tire treads indicate
two shooters, motorcycles.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.757
Think the agent was the target?

04:21.757 --> 04:23.092
I don't think so.

04:23.092 --> 04:24.629
Trajectories point to this man.

04:24.629 --> 04:26.399
Flaco Ruiz.

04:26.399 --> 04:27.568
Where's DEA on all this?

04:27.568 --> 04:29.038
PALMER:
Right here.

04:29.038 --> 04:31.676
Scorsese, Murtaugh.

04:33.479 --> 04:34.949
Riggs.

04:34.949 --> 04:38.690
Of all the donut shops in L. A.,
you had to walk into mine.

04:38.690 --> 04:40.961
You look different.

04:40.961 --> 04:42.598
He's got a
new shirt.
No.

04:42.598 --> 04:44.669
Oh. Oh, no? Well, I kind of
cleaned up around...

04:44.669 --> 04:45.838
It's your eyes.

04:45.838 --> 04:47.809
They're white.

04:47.809 --> 04:50.013
Sobriety becomes you.

04:54.722 --> 04:56.125
(camera clicks)

04:56.125 --> 04:57.562
Okay, so,

04:57.562 --> 04:59.064
Agent Palmer, what
can you tell us?

04:59.064 --> 05:01.135
Well, the deceased,
Flaco Ruiz,

05:01.135 --> 05:03.941
had come to us with information
about the cartel.

05:03.941 --> 05:06.613
Agent Zigman scheduled
an appointment with him

05:06.613 --> 05:07.815
to discuss terms.

05:07.815 --> 05:09.485
I was supposed to be there

05:09.485 --> 05:11.556
and got called away,
last minute.

05:11.556 --> 05:12.992
Lucky day.

05:12.992 --> 05:15.898
For some.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.835
SCORSESE: Now, it seems there
was someone else at the scene.

05:17.835 --> 05:19.506
Those footprints‐‐
the pointed tips,

05:19.506 --> 05:21.075
six oval bands‐‐

05:21.075 --> 05:24.616
from what I can gather,
I'd say size nine Ferragamos.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.918
Ferragamos, really?

05:25.918 --> 05:29.792
I know a thing or two
about shoes.

05:29.792 --> 05:31.930
Has anyone followed
the footprints?

05:32.965 --> 05:34.936
Come on.

05:36.172 --> 05:38.644
(sirens whooping)

05:38.644 --> 05:40.548
Just go.

05:40.548 --> 05:42.985
Please.
Just... (sighs)

05:42.985 --> 05:45.123
Quite a bit of tension
between those two.

05:45.123 --> 05:47.060
Not un‐sexual.

05:47.060 --> 05:47.929
You think?

05:47.929 --> 05:50.968
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

05:50.968 --> 05:53.507
What do you know about
the trajectory...

05:53.507 --> 05:54.976
Footprints trailed off.

05:54.976 --> 05:56.780
Whoever it was
jumped in a vehicle.

05:56.780 --> 05:59.519
Yeah. Security camera system
was down.

05:59.519 --> 06:01.088
Hey.

06:01.088 --> 06:04.127
It's nice to see you
playing so well with others.

06:05.664 --> 06:07.000
What's that supposed to mean?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.772
Come on, Riggs. Nobody wants
to go through life alone.

06:09.772 --> 06:12.210
You know, the right girl

06:12.210 --> 06:14.181
could catch your eye.

06:17.220 --> 06:18.857
Like her?

06:23.834 --> 06:25.971
If that's your speed,
I'm not gonna judge.

06:27.942 --> 06:30.146
Excuse me, ma'am?
Leave me alone!

06:30.146 --> 06:32.050
Whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, wait. Ma'am.
Get the hell away from me!

06:32.050 --> 06:34.589
Did you happen to see
the shooting across the street?

06:34.589 --> 06:36.860
No, I ducked when I heard shots.

06:36.860 --> 06:39.164
But I saw the guy.

06:39.164 --> 06:41.101
You saw the shooter?

06:41.101 --> 06:42.538
No, the weasel.

06:42.538 --> 06:44.542
He was running away.

06:44.542 --> 06:46.145
So he was a little man?

06:46.145 --> 06:48.617
No, a real weasel.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.821
Okay, what, uh, particular
kind of weasel are we talking?

know that the LAPD is here

for us to fast‐track
the meeting.

08:16.893 --> 08:18.930
(groans)
And who else knew about it?

08:18.930 --> 08:20.834
No one. It was
only in office.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.970

08:28.082 --> 08:30.319
Yeah, possibly.

08:30.319 --> 08:32.156
Possibly. And here I was
thinking that it was

I did ask Riggs out to dinner,

Mm‐hmm.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.441
Not too many of those now, okay?
Keep that. There you go.

10:04.441 --> 10:05.944
LAPD.

10:05.944 --> 10:09.451
Might we have a moment
of your time, Mr. Getz?

10:09.451 --> 10:11.288
Hey, just want to remind you:
sometimes the best medicine

10:11.288 --> 10:14.260
is a no‐fuss
cash settlement.

10:14.260 --> 10:15.897
Do that on the stand.

10:15.897 --> 10:19.471
Hey. Yes. Detectives.

10:19.471 --> 10:22.243
Perhaps we could, uh, kibitz
in my office, please? Hmm?

10:23.112 --> 10:24.247
Can you just‐‐ come on.

10:24.247 --> 10:25.751
What's kibitz?

10:27.253 --> 10:30.426
So, gentlemen.
What can I do for you?

10:30.426 --> 10:32.163
So, what were you doing
at Hi‐Ho Donuts

10:32.163 --> 10:33.432
this morning around 5:00 a. m.?

10:33.432 --> 10:35.236
Oh. (chuckles) Wow.

10:35.236 --> 10:38.308
Okay, um, well, I was eating‐‐

10:38.308 --> 10:40.146
wait for it‐‐ a donut.

10:40.146 --> 10:43.118
All right. Well, you know,
we can do this in our office.

10:43.118 --> 10:45.022
Coffee's not as good, but
the halogens are beautiful.

10:45.022 --> 10:47.293
Mm, not unless
you're arresting me, so...

10:47.293 --> 10:49.330
What a great idea!
You're under arrest,

10:49.330 --> 10:50.466
an accessory to murder.
Okay, okay.

10:50.466 --> 10:52.069
That's fine, but those charges
had better stick,

10:52.069 --> 10:53.005
because if they don't,

10:53.005 --> 10:54.007
I'm gonna sue you
for violating my rights,

10:54.007 --> 10:57.548
misprision of a felony
and kidnapping. Okay?

10:57.548 --> 10:59.585
Let's do it.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a camera?

10:59.585 --> 11:01.522
Can you please document
this excessive use of force?

11:01.522 --> 11:02.991
Excessive, and I
should let you know.

11:02.991 --> 11:05.029
I am close friends with
Harvey Levin of TMZ!

11:05.029 --> 11:06.364
Hey, hey, hey, Leo.

11:06.364 --> 11:08.268
Listen, listen, listen.
Okay.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.239
A few people died today
down at that shop.

11:10.239 --> 11:13.947
Don't you want
to help us know why?

11:13.947 --> 11:16.051
Of course I do.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.021
I seem to be
out of change.

11:31.414 --> 11:34.521
Black and creamy.

11:36.191 --> 11:38.796
(liquid pouring)

11:40.032 --> 11:41.969
It's done!

11:44.207 --> 11:45.877
Oh, it's so hot!

11:45.877 --> 11:49.217
Okay, I was in the bathroom
when the shots were fired,

11:49.217 --> 11:50.386
so I didn't see anything.

11:50.386 --> 11:53.292
As for Mr. Ruiz, he was my
client for exactly one day.

11:53.292 --> 11:54.962
What, Flaco hired you
the day of?

11:54.962 --> 11:55.964
I'm the bus guy.

11:55.964 --> 11:57.601
People call me
at the last minute all the time.

11:57.601 --> 11:59.972
Mr. Ruiz called me
because he said

11:59.972 --> 12:01.007
the DEA was ready
to make a deal,

12:01.007 --> 12:02.844
and I was there to help
with the negotiation.

12:02.844 --> 12:05.917
Of course, before we could get
into the specifics, he was‐‐

12:05.917 --> 12:10.627
how shall we say‐‐ relieved
of his ability to breathe, so...

12:10.627 --> 12:12.196
Hey, listen,
don't you think

12:12.196 --> 12:13.298
that if we figured it out,

12:13.298 --> 12:15.971
that the cartel figured out
that you were there, too?

12:15.971 --> 12:18.843
If you go out there,
it's with a target on your back.

12:21.582 --> 12:25.089
Thank you for your concern,
but I can take care of myself.

12:26.525 --> 12:28.830
Oh, by all means.
(clears throat)

12:30.265 --> 12:31.502
What are you doing?

12:31.502 --> 12:32.904
I thought we were
taking him to Palmer.

12:32.904 --> 12:34.575
I say let the cartel
go after him.

12:34.575 --> 12:37.981
You mean use
him as bait?

12:37.981 --> 12:40.486
Well, yeah.

12:40.486 --> 12:42.591
Yeah, it's
a good idea.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.936
Hey.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.272
Okay, I'm gonna need
a house taco,

12:50.272 --> 12:52.611
and I'm gonna need a phone
to talk to your boss.

12:52.611 --> 12:53.478
I <i>am</i> the boss.

12:53.478 --> 12:55.282
Pablo, we both know
that this stand

12:55.282 --> 12:57.053
is Flores owned and operated.

12:57.053 --> 12:58.723
Okay? So I'm gonna
need a phone

12:58.723 --> 13:01.662
to talk to your boss,
the actual boss,

13:01.662 --> 13:03.966
so that I can be
on the record

13:03.966 --> 13:05.503
that I was at the donut shop
this morning

13:05.503 --> 13:08.976
in an exclusively
unofficial capacity.

13:08.976 --> 13:11.381
I didn't see anything,
I don't know anything,

13:11.381 --> 13:13.018
I'm not gonna say anything,

13:13.018 --> 13:15.255
and I certainly should not
be walking around

13:15.255 --> 13:16.992
with a target on my back!

13:16.992 --> 13:19.263
RIGGS:
Doesn't necessarily look like

13:19.263 --> 13:20.567
he's ordering tacos, does it?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.604
MURTAUGH:
Mm‐mm. Maybe the three‐bean,

13:22.604 --> 13:24.641
<i>triple‐thick</i>
<i>meat burrito requires</i>

13:24.641 --> 13:28.014
that level of gesticulation,
but not a taco.

13:32.189 --> 13:33.526
RIGGS:
Uh‐oh.

13:33.526 --> 13:35.028
What is she doing here?

13:35.028 --> 13:36.197
I guess she followed us.

13:36.197 --> 13:37.534
LEO:
So,

13:37.534 --> 13:38.736
I will be waiting

13:38.736 --> 13:41.509
for the phone call
and the taco.

13:41.509 --> 13:43.513
And don't be stingy
with the tomatillo.

13:43.513 --> 13:46.184
Leo, Agent Palmer, DEA.

13:46.184 --> 13:48.121
(men murmuring)
I‐I don't know you.

13:48.121 --> 13:49.056
I don't know you!

13:49.056 --> 13:51.060
I don't know her.
I don't know you.

13:51.060 --> 13:53.165
I would never
work with the DEA.

13:54.568 --> 13:55.670
Are you... are you

13:55.670 --> 13:57.206
actively trying
to get me killed?

13:57.206 --> 13:58.275
I am here to protect you.

13:58.275 --> 14:00.379
Oh, perfect, because
the last time you did that,

14:00.379 --> 14:01.414
we had a Boston Cream Massacre!

14:01.414 --> 14:03.418
Hey! Did you kids
order yet?

14:03.418 --> 14:06.559
I hear their carne
asada is... fantastic.

14:06.559 --> 14:08.028
PALMER: Detective Riggs,
what a surprise.

14:08.028 --> 14:09.297
You lied to me.
You were supposed

14:09.297 --> 14:10.399
to bring him in
for questioning.

14:10.399 --> 14:11.635
We just came up
with a better plan.

14:11.635 --> 14:13.305
Oh, great. What's the plan?

14:13.305 --> 14:15.075
We're gonna use him as bait.

14:15.075 --> 14:16.311
Wait. What?

14:16.311 --> 14:18.148
Wait! What?!

14:18.148 --> 14:19.183
I'm bait?!

14:19.183 --> 14:20.553
RIGGS: Clearly, he wasn't
aware of the plan.

14:20.553 --> 14:21.655
LEO:
By the way, candidly,

14:21.655 --> 14:22.757
it's idiotic,

14:22.757 --> 14:23.726
because the odds of
one of these people

14:23.726 --> 14:25.630
taking a shot at me‐‐
These people love‐‐

14:25.630 --> 14:26.999
I'm like a made man
around here.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.335
I am beloved in this community.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.472
I'm like a made man...
Leo. Leo!

14:33.345 --> 14:35.482
(people screaming)

14:40.225 --> 14:42.631
Ah! Help!
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm hit!

14:42.631 --> 14:44.635
Relax. It's just salsa.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.437
(gasps)
Here.

14:46.437 --> 14:47.607
Ugh!

14:47.607 --> 14:49.645
Good plan.

14:49.645 --> 14:53.619
Well, in our defense,
it did work.

14:56.525 --> 14:58.295
Look, I will get the white board
out and I will show you two...

14:58.295 --> 15:01.167
(overlapping chatter)

15:01.167 --> 15:03.071
Listen, we did, admittedly,
have a plan

15:03.071 --> 15:04.641
that involved <i>some</i> risk

15:04.641 --> 15:06.344
to Mr. Getz.
But in fairness,

15:06.344 --> 15:08.214
we did get Leo and the cook.
Yup, yup.

15:08.214 --> 15:10.385
So, I mean, it really turned out
better than we drew it up.

15:10.385 --> 15:12.289
Except you didn't
tell <i>me</i> the plan.

15:12.289 --> 15:13.693
Okay, well, Palmer,
we didn't know you liked tacos.

15:13.693 --> 15:16.064
Well, that's because
you turned down her dinner date.

15:16.064 --> 15:17.232
AVERY: Murtaugh, that
was uncalled for.

15:17.232 --> 15:18.268
But it was‐‐ it's a fair point.

15:18.268 --> 15:19.538
It's a fair point.

15:19.538 --> 15:20.707
Agent Palmer?
Yes.

15:20.707 --> 15:23.144
We've given you access
to both men in our custody.

15:23.144 --> 15:25.516
Can you now tell us more
about this major player?

15:27.252 --> 15:28.388
Hmm?

15:28.388 --> 15:29.524
Um...

15:30.626 --> 15:32.664
(sighs)

15:32.664 --> 15:34.601
All right.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.572
He is The Architect.

15:36.572 --> 15:37.439
An architect?

15:37.439 --> 15:39.578
The Architect.
It's how the cartel

15:39.578 --> 15:41.648
refers to the man
who designed and runs

15:41.648 --> 15:44.086
the entire money‐laundering
operation here in L. A.

15:45.590 --> 15:46.825
That's significant.

15:46.825 --> 15:49.163
MURTAUGH:
So does Leo know who he is?

15:49.163 --> 15:52.369
Well, I doubt it,
but the cook may.

15:52.369 --> 15:54.440
I'm filing paperwork to have him
transferred to federal lockup.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.377
He hasn't said a word
since he's been here,

15:56.377 --> 15:57.847
but once he's in federal
supermax, that will change.

15:57.847 --> 16:00.485
Oh, we're not‐‐ What happened
to us working together?

16:00.485 --> 16:03.425
We tried. You almost got me
and my witness killed.

16:03.425 --> 16:06.532
Al... But <i>almost.</i>
I <i>almost</i> got him killed.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.101
You're missing
the "almost" part.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.236
Well, that didn't take long.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.809
Now she's saying we can't sit
at the grown‐up table.

16:11.809 --> 16:13.244
You two hate the
grown‐up table.

16:13.244 --> 16:15.148
We hate the grown‐up table.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.518
Plus, we still
have our witnesses.

16:16.518 --> 16:17.453
Go get Leo to talk.

16:17.453 --> 16:19.724
Huh. Getting Leo to talk
is the easy part.

16:19.724 --> 16:22.530
Getting Leo to shut up‐‐
that's the hard part.

16:22.530 --> 16:24.233
What do I want?

16:24.233 --> 16:28.141
Well, my terms can be
summed up in a word.

16:29.544 --> 16:31.648
Protection.

16:31.648 --> 16:34.386
For me... and my reputation.

16:34.386 --> 16:36.859
Okay, that's six words, and
before you start talking terms,

16:36.859 --> 16:38.495
you might want
to, uh, show us

16:38.495 --> 16:40.298
that you have something
that we want.

16:40.298 --> 16:43.906
Um, well, the cartel tried
to kill me... twice,

16:43.906 --> 16:46.879
so, uh, clearly, I have value.

16:46.879 --> 16:48.314
Or they don't like you.

16:48.314 --> 16:49.751
Or you talk too much.

16:49.751 --> 16:51.822
Okay, terrific.
Yeah? Yeah?

16:51.822 --> 16:55.228
Here is me going
towards the exit.

16:55.228 --> 16:56.230
Here is me going out the door,

16:56.230 --> 16:59.169
and once I'm gone...
(bangs loudly on table)

17:08.187 --> 17:09.490
What do you want?

17:09.490 --> 17:12.897
What was Flaco
gonna tell the DEA?

17:12.897 --> 17:15.268
He didn't tell me.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.905
Who is The Architect?

17:16.905 --> 17:19.578
I don't know.

17:19.578 --> 17:21.314
Who were the gunmen?

17:23.484 --> 17:24.621
Okay.

17:24.621 --> 17:27.225
When I said I had
value, I might have

17:27.225 --> 17:29.229
overstated my position by
a little bit, but, look,

17:29.229 --> 17:33.471
all I ask is that
you protect me...

17:33.471 --> 17:35.475
from whoever's trying
to kill me.

17:35.475 --> 17:36.444
All right,
so he's useless.

17:36.444 --> 17:37.747
Look, I'm gonna go talk
to the cook, see if

17:37.747 --> 17:41.253
he's got anything...
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

17:41.253 --> 17:42.790
Pablo is still here?

17:42.790 --> 17:45.261
(chuckles):
Oh. Oh.

17:45.261 --> 17:49.671
Uh, last year, I helped
get Pablo out of a rather

17:49.671 --> 17:52.577
professionally, uh, delicate

17:52.577 --> 17:54.848
legal situation,
and perhaps you could

17:54.848 --> 17:56.217
use that
to your advantage.

17:56.217 --> 17:57.553
What kind of legal situation?

17:57.553 --> 17:59.390
Oh. Hmm.

17:59.390 --> 18:03.766
Well, first, I
shall require...

18:03.766 --> 18:06.103
a beverage.

18:08.776 --> 18:09.778
All right.

18:09.778 --> 18:12.817
All right, here we go. That's...

18:12.817 --> 18:14.186
(groans softly)

18:15.656 --> 18:17.593
I prefer sparkling.

18:23.839 --> 18:25.743
Ow.

18:25.743 --> 18:27.245
Pablo honey!

18:27.245 --> 18:28.849
We need to talk.

18:28.849 --> 18:31.153
Mm‐hmm.

18:34.994 --> 18:36.832
Looks like
he doesn't want to talk.

18:36.832 --> 18:37.834
Well, you know what?
Hmm?

18:37.834 --> 18:38.902
We can talk.

18:38.902 --> 18:40.138
We can talk.
We can, right?
You and I could‐‐

18:40.138 --> 18:43.512
What do you want to talk‐‐
What do you want to talk about?

18:43.512 --> 18:46.985
Let's start with
Pablo's recent charges

18:46.985 --> 18:49.624
of public indecency.
RIGGS: Wait.

18:49.624 --> 18:52.797
Was that when he was busted
with Tito Flores's niece?

18:52.797 --> 18:54.433
No, no, no, it wasn't the niece.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.903
It was the niece's husband.

18:55.903 --> 18:57.339
RIGGS: That's right.
Yeah.

18:57.339 --> 18:58.675
RIGGS:
You were caught

18:58.675 --> 19:00.478
in a parking lot
playing hide‐the‐chalupa.

19:00.478 --> 19:01.581
MURTAUGH:
Mm‐hmm.

19:01.581 --> 19:03.952
Okay. Just...
My lawyer got that kicked.

19:03.952 --> 19:06.423
He said it's not on my record.

19:06.423 --> 19:08.762
(Riggs and Murtaugh laugh)

19:08.762 --> 19:10.633
RIGGS:
Well, yeah,

19:10.633 --> 19:12.503
but it doesn't mean
we can't talk about it.

19:12.503 --> 19:16.578
And if we talk loud enough,
Tito's gonna hear about it.

19:16.578 --> 19:20.519
And if Tito hears,
then Tito could get really mad.

19:20.519 --> 19:22.990
And if he gets mad,
well, then it's...

19:22.990 --> 19:24.727
bye‐bye, chalupa.

19:24.727 --> 19:27.332
Ay, chalupa. Ay‐ay‐ay!
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.036
Yeah. What do you want to know?

19:29.036 --> 19:30.639
Who's The Architect?

19:35.916 --> 19:37.587
I‐I don't know.

19:37.587 --> 19:39.423
I'm hungry.
Mm‐hmm.

19:39.423 --> 19:40.893
Let's go get some tacos.
Yeah.

19:40.893 --> 19:42.362
No chalupa.

19:42.362 --> 19:44.366
Yeah, I never seen him,
all right?

19:44.366 --> 19:46.771
No one has.
Look, all I can tell you is,

19:46.771 --> 19:49.376
everyone's mad
about the donut shop screw‐up.

19:49.376 --> 19:53.384
Screw‐up? They took down
a DEA agent and Flaco.

19:53.384 --> 19:54.520
Yeah, but they missed her.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.558
What are you talking about?
There were no female victims

19:56.558 --> 19:57.760
at...

19:57.760 --> 19:59.263
Palmer.

20:00.398 --> 20:02.068
She was supposed to be
at the donut shop.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.471
And she was at the taco stand.

20:06.945 --> 20:08.615
(phone ringing)

20:12.690 --> 20:14.894
Hey, Riggs. If you're
calling me to apologize...

20:14.894 --> 20:16.497
Hey, Palmer,
where are you?

20:16.497 --> 20:20.739
I'm, like, a block away,
headed over to get my witness.

20:20.739 --> 20:22.910
Listen to me.
Leo wasn't the target.

20:22.910 --> 20:24.847
You are.

20:32.663 --> 20:34.066
(gunfire, people screaming)

20:34.066 --> 20:36.103
MURTAUGH:
Get out of the way!

20:43.084 --> 20:44.721
(grunts)

20:48.194 --> 20:49.597
Palmer?

20:52.937 --> 20:54.774
(sirens approaching)

20:54.774 --> 20:55.776
(gasps loudly)

20:55.776 --> 20:57.379
(panting)
Hey.

21:05.061 --> 21:07.132
You okay?

21:07.132 --> 21:09.136
(whimpering)

21:09.136 --> 21:11.140
Okay. You're okay.

21:11.140 --> 21:13.545
(sirens approaching)
You're okay.

21:15.582 --> 21:18.855
(door opens, closes)
Ballistics are in, Ramon.

21:18.855 --> 21:22.630
You're going down for murdering
a DEA agent, plus two others.

21:22.630 --> 21:24.834
Oh, and you tried
to kill me three times.

21:24.834 --> 21:27.439
And see, she's got a whole
three‐strike rule when it comes

21:27.439 --> 21:28.474
to murder attempts.

21:28.474 --> 21:30.011
Look, I know there's
nothing I can offer you

21:30.011 --> 21:31.748
to get you to turn
on the cartel.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.952
But there is something
I can offer your family.

21:33.952 --> 21:36.524
Now, your little
brother's doing...

21:36.524 --> 21:39.564
five in Pelican Bay.

21:39.564 --> 21:42.903
So if you talk, I can have him
moved closer to your parents.

21:44.807 --> 21:49.049
Or... I can have him put
in a solitary unit.

21:49.049 --> 21:51.120
No sun, no yard.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.831
So it's your call.
What do you want?

21:58.033 --> 21:59.102
(sighs)

21:59.102 --> 22:00.572
I've never seen him.

22:00.572 --> 22:03.545
The Architect
is like a ghost.

22:03.545 --> 22:06.183
All right. Well, I've been
working on this case for years,

22:06.183 --> 22:09.156
and now all of a sudden
there's three attempts on me.

22:09.156 --> 22:10.158
Explain that.

22:10.158 --> 22:12.228
I got a text on a burner
at the crack of dawn.

22:12.228 --> 22:15.067
I was barely awake when
they told me to go.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.005
It couldn't wait?

22:19.911 --> 22:22.583
Who'd you piss off Sunday night?

22:27.693 --> 22:29.797
(R&B music playing)

22:33.103 --> 22:35.609
TRISH:
Baby, is that you?

22:35.609 --> 22:37.713
♪ ♪

22:42.590 --> 22:44.660
Hey.
Hey.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.129
You enjoying yourself?

22:46.129 --> 22:48.300
I am celebrating

22:48.300 --> 22:49.570
my new adventure.

22:49.570 --> 22:51.708
(chuckles)
I am so proud of you.

22:51.708 --> 22:53.945
Me, too. Know why?

22:53.945 --> 22:54.880
Why?

22:54.880 --> 22:56.884
When I got to
work, after

22:56.884 --> 23:00.559
the whole partner committee told
me how much they loved me...

23:00.559 --> 23:03.264
That's right. Mm‐hmm.
... and how much I've
done for the firm,

23:03.264 --> 23:06.103
they promoted... Gene

23:06.103 --> 23:08.575
instead.

23:08.575 --> 23:11.914
So you <i>didn't</i> get it?

23:11.914 --> 23:13.852
So I quit.

23:15.187 --> 23:16.858
And, Roger...

23:16.858 --> 23:19.797
(exhales)
it felt so damn good.

23:19.797 --> 23:21.968
They don't
deserve me there.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.805
Yeah. So...

23:23.805 --> 23:25.876
(chuckles softly)
you quit.

23:25.876 --> 23:27.980
That‐that means
you're unemployed.

23:27.980 --> 23:31.053
(laughs): Oh, my‐‐
For the first time!

23:31.053 --> 23:34.727
(laughing)
In 20 years! Yes!

23:34.727 --> 23:36.764
Okay. So, um...

23:36.764 --> 23:39.135
I'm j... I'm just wondering,

23:39.135 --> 23:41.674
how did you leave it
with the firm?

23:41.674 --> 23:43.143
Was it, was it amicable?

23:43.143 --> 23:44.880
Mm.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.185
Hell to the no. (chuckles)

23:47.185 --> 23:48.387
It was not amicable.

23:48.387 --> 23:51.794
Okay, I just, I just need
to know how deep the hole is,

23:51.794 --> 23:54.834
you know, just if
you change your mind.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.606
I need to feel you
supporting me here, Roger.

23:57.606 --> 23:58.775
Baby, I am.

23:58.775 --> 24:01.079
But you know and I know
that a detective's salary...

24:01.079 --> 24:02.181
You know what? Stop.

24:02.181 --> 24:05.054
You're‐you're ruining my
celebration and my bath.

24:05.054 --> 24:06.624
All right.

24:08.060 --> 24:10.131
But that resistance pool
ain't happening.

24:10.131 --> 24:11.299
Get out.

24:11.299 --> 24:12.836
Okay.

24:14.339 --> 24:15.207
Psst. Hey.

24:15.207 --> 24:16.911
You're out of mustard.
I was gonna

24:16.911 --> 24:18.013
make us sandwiches,
but we need mustard.

24:18.013 --> 24:19.215
TRISH: Roger?
We got company, baby.

24:19.215 --> 24:21.921
I told you wait in the car.
I was starving.

24:22.990 --> 24:24.359
Oh.

24:24.359 --> 24:25.595
Who is this?

24:25.595 --> 24:26.831
Hi.

24:26.831 --> 24:28.668
Hello. Leo Getz,

24:28.668 --> 24:30.304
Attorney‐at‐Law.

24:30.304 --> 24:32.074
MURTAUGH: He's part of
the investigation we're working.

24:32.074 --> 24:34.212
I have to babysit him
for the night.

24:34.212 --> 24:36.116
The bus guy?
Yeah.

24:36.116 --> 24:37.953
Yeah. (chuckles)

24:37.953 --> 24:40.324
Yes. Yeah, I
have billboards.

24:40.324 --> 24:42.128
<i>A</i> billboard, too. Yes.

24:42.128 --> 24:44.265
But, um, I‐I'm sorry,
I couldn't help but overhear,

24:44.265 --> 24:46.971
uh, you talking about your
decision to leave your firm,

24:46.971 --> 24:49.409
and take it from me,
nothing compares to being

24:49.409 --> 24:51.881
on your own‐‐ like, being fired
from the D. A.'s office

24:51.881 --> 24:53.751
was the best thing that
ever happened to me, so...

24:53.751 --> 24:54.987
worked great for me.

24:54.987 --> 24:56.924
I think it'll work
for you, too.

24:56.924 --> 24:58.327
Thank you, Mr. Getz.

25:00.899 --> 25:02.903
For your... support.

25:02.903 --> 25:04.940
Trish, we could talk
about this. Listen.
No.

25:04.940 --> 25:06.811
I'm so sorry that...
Mm‐mm. No.

25:07.713 --> 25:09.917
Now...

25:09.917 --> 25:12.388
what are we gonna do about
this mustard situation, hmm?

25:12.388 --> 25:13.958
(bottle squeaking)

25:13.958 --> 25:16.062
PALMER: <i>The last thing I did</i>
<i>Sunday night</i>

25:16.062 --> 25:17.733
was file blanket subpoenas

25:17.733 --> 25:20.104
for ten businesses
with ties to the cartel.

25:20.104 --> 25:21.807
And you're saying one of them
might be The Architect?

25:21.807 --> 25:22.743
Which is why now

25:22.743 --> 25:23.811
I have to go through
all these financials

25:23.811 --> 25:26.249
and figure out which business
is hiding our man.

25:26.249 --> 25:27.986
All right, well...

25:27.986 --> 25:29.389
I'll stay and help.

25:29.389 --> 25:31.894
Riggs, no. I mean,
this is not fun stuff.

25:31.894 --> 25:33.798
You don't get to shoot any guns.

25:33.798 --> 25:35.034
You are not
chasing anyone.
Hey.

25:35.034 --> 25:38.006
I know it's baby steps, but
I put on a new shirt today.

25:38.006 --> 25:39.777
All right?
I'm a changed man.

25:42.683 --> 25:44.787
(sighs)

25:54.405 --> 25:56.309
(sighs)

25:56.309 --> 25:58.046
Are you hungry?

25:58.046 --> 25:59.917
I was thinking about
maybe going...

25:59.917 --> 26:02.188
I don't eat
out of vending machines.

26:05.762 --> 26:07.098
Oh, yeah.

26:07.098 --> 26:08.901
Well, yeah, no, that's...

26:12.809 --> 26:14.345
Okay. (sighs)

26:14.345 --> 26:15.882
(pops lips)

26:19.422 --> 26:21.426
If you were gonna eat, right,
if you were gonna eat‐‐

26:21.426 --> 26:23.296
not if you were going out to
dinner‐‐ like, if you were

26:23.296 --> 26:25.200
just gonna, let's say you
were just hungry, right,

26:25.200 --> 26:27.171
just trying to, like...
Chinese.

26:27.171 --> 26:28.775
(snaps fingers)

26:30.912 --> 26:32.783
Are you a family style?

26:32.783 --> 26:33.918
Do you like to go solo?

26:33.918 --> 26:34.987
Riggs, order food.

26:34.987 --> 26:36.356
Just order. Okay.

26:42.736 --> 26:44.272
(siren wailing in distance)

26:46.844 --> 26:50.250
Oh! Disgusting.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.856
You know what happens
in places like this?

26:52.856 --> 26:55.327
My clients stay here.

26:55.327 --> 26:57.933
Which side do you want?

26:58.835 --> 27:00.370
The bed.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.507
You take the chair.

27:01.507 --> 27:03.143
The chair?

27:03.143 --> 27:05.080
Yeah, I can make that work.

27:07.184 --> 27:08.286
(sighs)

27:11.459 --> 27:14.065
Hey.

27:14.065 --> 27:15.969
About that thing
with your wife today‐‐

27:15.969 --> 27:17.839
can I offer you
a bit of advice,

27:17.839 --> 27:19.877
based on my experience?

27:19.877 --> 27:23.116
Your experience and my wife's
are totally different.

27:23.116 --> 27:25.789
She's a legal
rock star.

27:25.789 --> 27:27.258
You're a...

27:27.258 --> 27:28.528
scam artist.

27:28.528 --> 27:30.965
Respectfully.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.203
(exhales)

27:36.242 --> 27:38.815
You want to insult me?
That's fine.

27:38.815 --> 27:41.119
'Cause at the end of the day...

27:41.119 --> 27:42.889
I know how to survive.

27:42.889 --> 27:44.125
(chuckles)
Yeah.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.995
Like a cockroach.

27:51.172 --> 27:53.009
Exactly.
And you know what?

27:53.009 --> 27:54.847
You know those big,
fancy law firms,

27:54.847 --> 27:56.349
like the one
your wife was at?

27:56.349 --> 27:58.888
Well, they're all part
of a big boys' club.

27:58.888 --> 28:00.290
Probably part of why she left.

28:00.290 --> 28:03.396
You take me, and you put me
at one of those firms,

28:03.396 --> 28:05.535
I'd do okay.

28:05.535 --> 28:08.507
But you take any one
of those silver‐spoon prigs

28:08.507 --> 28:11.479
and expect them to survive
on the street, well...

28:11.479 --> 28:13.116
(chuckles)
No.

28:13.116 --> 28:15.922
They would die
like dogs.

28:15.922 --> 28:18.493
And you know what?

28:18.493 --> 28:21.266
It took some spine to do
what your wife did today.

28:21.266 --> 28:24.873
If you can't see that,
then you got bigger problems

28:24.873 --> 28:26.376
than paying
for your kids' college.

Good morning.

29:28.299 --> 29:30.070
Hey, Rog!

29:30.070 --> 29:32.374
What's going on? Look, there's
plenty of stacks to go through.

29:32.374 --> 29:34.445
We've got,
uh, phone logs,

29:34.445 --> 29:35.581
tax documents.

29:35.581 --> 29:37.619
Have at it, big guy.

29:37.619 --> 29:39.221
You two been here
all night?

29:39.221 --> 29:41.225
Yeah, well, some of us
are dedicated, Rog.

29:41.225 --> 29:43.063
Mm‐hmm.
We narrowed The
Architect down

29:43.063 --> 29:44.498
to one of three firms.

29:44.498 --> 29:46.570
So, are we looking
for anything specific here?

29:46.570 --> 29:49.676
Um, maybe a high‐value transfer.

29:49.676 --> 29:51.680
Or if you can find
an e‐mail or text

29:51.680 --> 29:53.116
where someone
refers to themself

29:53.116 --> 29:56.155
as The Architect,
that would be helpful.
Yeah.

29:56.155 --> 29:57.357
What about a phone number?

29:57.357 --> 29:58.928
999‐

29:58.928 --> 30:01.165
536‐4389.

30:01.165 --> 30:02.134
What is that?

30:02.134 --> 30:05.140
I don't know, but
it's very familiar.

30:07.512 --> 30:09.014
GETZ (recorded):
Leo Getz you off.

30:09.014 --> 30:11.653
Leo Getz you off.
Let Getz you off.

30:11.653 --> 30:13.223
Leo Getz you off.

30:13.223 --> 30:15.093
Leo Getz, Attorney‐at‐Law.

30:15.093 --> 30:16.229
Leo...

30:16.229 --> 30:18.032
is that you?

30:18.032 --> 30:19.401
Hey.

30:20.303 --> 30:21.740
Is that, is that you?

30:21.740 --> 30:24.211
This phone is for
legitimate business calls.

30:24.211 --> 30:27.151
Someone from Weyburn Advisors
called you the night before

30:27.151 --> 30:28.219
the donut hit. Who?

30:28.219 --> 30:29.723
Uh, that night?

30:29.723 --> 30:32.294
Um, I had only one call.
Flaco Ruiz.

30:32.294 --> 30:33.664
That's it.

30:33.664 --> 30:35.500
Weyburn Advisors
is The Architect's cover.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.471
Okay, um, hold on.

30:37.471 --> 30:40.545
Weyburn Advisors‐‐
they have one sole

30:40.545 --> 30:42.447
owner and operator:
Stafford White.

30:42.447 --> 30:45.053
Let's pick him up.
No, not yet, you guys.
I have to get a warrant.

30:45.053 --> 30:47.124
So just go to his office
and be ready, okay?

30:47.124 --> 30:48.627
Riggs, I mean it‐‐
please wait for me to call,

30:48.627 --> 30:50.197
and then you can
kick the door in.

30:50.197 --> 30:54.205
(chuckles) I told you...
I'm a changed man.

30:54.205 --> 30:55.575
Changed man.

31:07.497 --> 31:09.134
(sighs)

31:11.506 --> 31:13.142
What are you doing?

31:13.142 --> 31:15.347
Weyburn's up on
the 13th floor.

31:15.347 --> 31:17.084
Palmer said to wait.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.656
Oh, well, yeah, we'll
wait, but we'll...

31:19.656 --> 31:21.092
you know, wait upstairs.

31:21.092 --> 31:22.327
That way, when the
warrant arrives, you know,

31:22.327 --> 31:24.733
we're on the job ready to go.
It's a win‐win, really.

31:24.733 --> 31:27.104
Trish quit her job.

31:27.104 --> 31:29.141
And I don't know
if she can get another one,

31:29.141 --> 31:32.381
or even if she wants to
if she could.

31:32.381 --> 31:34.285
Uh, wait a minute.

31:34.285 --> 31:36.255
We're talking about
your wife, right?

31:36.255 --> 31:38.159
(clears throat)

31:38.159 --> 31:40.363
I mean, is there
a human being alive

31:40.363 --> 31:43.069
more capable of taking care of
business than Trish Murtaugh?

31:44.371 --> 31:46.275
No. I guess not.

31:46.275 --> 31:49.481
Come on, what are
you worried about?

31:49.481 --> 31:52.087
I worry.

31:52.087 --> 31:54.592
Bad stuff happens,
all the time.

31:54.592 --> 31:55.695
(elevator bell dings)

31:58.132 --> 32:00.203
Just ask this guy.

32:02.742 --> 32:05.313
Wait a minute,
is this The Architect?

32:05.313 --> 32:06.415
Yeah.

32:06.415 --> 32:09.656
This is the guy that Palmer
asked us to look for.

32:15.801 --> 32:17.672
(elevator bell dings)

32:19.843 --> 32:21.212
(groans)

32:21.212 --> 32:23.650
Palmer? Palmer?!

32:27.457 --> 32:29.161
(phone rings)

32:29.161 --> 32:30.765
Hey, Leo. It's a bad time.
What's up?

32:30.765 --> 32:32.802
Okay, I know this is
gonna sound odd,

32:32.802 --> 32:34.171
but I am in hot pursuit

32:34.171 --> 32:35.775
of an ambulance
headed east on Spring!

32:35.775 --> 32:37.578
You're chasing an ambulance.

32:37.578 --> 32:39.448
I know, I know.
Palmer's inside it!

32:39.448 --> 32:41.352
A couple of cartel guys
dressed like EMTs grabbed her,

32:41.352 --> 32:43.356
and they're taking her
to who knows where.

32:43.356 --> 32:44.893
Hey. They kidnapped Palmer.
We got eyes on them.

32:44.893 --> 32:47.164
Who has eyes?
Leo.

32:47.164 --> 32:47.832
Leo?

32:47.832 --> 32:49.669
(car horns honking)

33:02.762 --> 33:04.465
Okay. They just pulled
into some sort of,

33:04.465 --> 33:05.801
uh, abandoned diner
or gas station.

33:05.801 --> 33:07.003
I'm gonna see
if I can get closer.

33:07.003 --> 33:10.578
MURTAUGH: <i>No, Leo.</i>
<i>Stay put until we get there.</i>

33:18.459 --> 33:19.796
Okay, so...

33:19.796 --> 33:23.504
uh, it's an old hotel
on the, on the north side

33:23.504 --> 33:24.739
of the highway.

33:24.739 --> 33:26.475
I'm out of view.

33:26.475 --> 33:28.212
So, uh...

33:28.212 --> 33:29.749
what are my, uh...

33:29.749 --> 33:32.555
like, uh,
rules of engagement here?

33:32.555 --> 33:33.891
MURTAUGH:
<i>There are no rules.</i>

33:33.891 --> 33:36.362
You do not engage!
You stand down!

33:36.362 --> 33:38.366
Do you understand me?
Calm down, calm down.

33:38.366 --> 33:39.769
They don't even know
that I'm here.

33:39.769 --> 33:41.171
They know that I'm here!
(gunfire)

33:48.754 --> 33:50.691

Palmer.

33:56.937 --> 33:58.907
If they get her
in that chopper, she's dead.

34:04.251 --> 34:05.053
Look, you go after Leo,

34:05.053 --> 34:06.288
I'm going after Palmer.
Got it.

34:09.394 --> 34:10.764
Go, go, go! Let's go!

34:10.764 --> 34:12.635

Wait.

34:12.635 --> 34:13.737
Hey.

34:13.737 --> 34:15.373
Wait, wait. Wait.

34:15.373 --> 34:16.743
Don't shoot.

34:16.743 --> 34:18.412

Hi.
Hello.

Um, I got a plan.
No, I got a plan!

35:42.548 --> 35:43.449
BOTH:
We jump!

35:43.449 --> 35:44.886
Oh. What are the odds?

35:44.886 --> 35:46.421
Both have the same plan.
Of us surviving?

Very little.

Well, I figured
you'd end up in bed with me.

36:21.926 --> 36:23.864
AVERY: ... and one decommissioned
military helicopter

36:23.864 --> 36:25.132
were either seized or destroyed,

36:25.132 --> 36:28.339
as half a dozen members of the
Flores cartel and their agents

36:28.339 --> 36:30.042
were brought to justice
earlier today.

36:30.042 --> 36:31.913
None of this
could have been possible

36:31.913 --> 36:33.783
without the work of the DEA,

Thank you.

Ah. He was supposed
to say my number.

Everyone already knows
your number.

41:07.163 --> 41:09.300
You know, a big‐big case
that I'm, uh...

41:09.300 --> 41:11.204
got going here.

41:11.204 --> 41:12.339
It's kind of
top secret, though,

41:12.339 --> 41:14.210
so I want to keep it
kind of covered...

41:17.149 --> 41:20.757
That is a Chinese
food menu.

41:20.757 --> 41:22.861
Well...

41:25.967 --> 41:30.209
There's a big
MSG poisoning, uh, sting

41:30.209 --> 41:32.046
that I've been
trying to set up.

41:32.046 --> 41:33.716
A racket.
Riggs.

41:33.716 --> 41:35.118
Yeah?

41:36.689 --> 41:40.062
It has been very scary
working with you.

41:40.062 --> 41:43.970
But not entirely
unenjoyable.

41:45.840 --> 41:48.880
Well, Agent Palmer,

41:48.880 --> 41:51.819
uh, truth be told,

41:51.819 --> 41:55.125
it hasn't been entirely
unenjoyable working with you.

(sighs)

42:47.062 --> 42:49.333
Wow, I can't believe
I'm doing this.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.805
You're damn right

I think your next big thing,

43:00.823 --> 43:02.126
Baby,

43:06.969 --> 43:09.675
That man better
