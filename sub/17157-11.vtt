00:08.833 --> 00:10.233
- Welcome to Spanish Club.

00:10.233 --> 00:12.800
Today's agenda,
discussing the tango,

00:12.800 --> 00:14.500
artist Frida Kahlo,

00:14.500 --> 00:17.533
and a recap of last night's
Latin American soccer scores.

00:17.533 --> 00:19.433
Everybody tied.

00:19.433 --> 00:22.967
- Lawrence, as a proud Latino,
allow me to say

00:22.967 --> 00:24.867
I don't care about any
of that junk.

00:24.867 --> 00:25.967
When do we eat?

00:25.967 --> 00:27.967
- After we take attendance.

00:27.967 --> 00:29.233
Tomika, aqui.

00:29.233 --> 00:31.533
Freddy, aqui.
Clark?

00:31.533 --> 00:34.100
- It's pronounced
"Clar-r-rk,"

00:34.100 --> 00:35.767
which I would expect
the President

00:35.767 --> 00:37.100
of the Spanish Club
to know,

00:37.100 --> 00:39.933
even though he only beat me
by one vote.

00:39.933 --> 00:42.733
- A win's a win, Clar-r-rk.

00:42.733 --> 00:44.200
- Not even close.

00:44.200 --> 00:46.933
You will never have
the R r-r-rolling skills

00:46.933 --> 00:49.733
of Clar-r-rk R-r-rodr-r-riguez.

00:49.733 --> 00:53.033
- Your last name's
O'Shannon.

00:53.033 --> 00:56.500
Okay, next is Es--Es--

00:56.500 --> 01:00.067
[stuttering]

01:00.067 --> 01:01.567
- What's going on?

01:01.567 --> 01:03.633
- He has a huge crush
on Esme.

01:03.633 --> 01:05.667
He can't even talk
when he's around her.

01:05.667 --> 01:09.200
- Getting nervous around a girl?
Is that a thing?

01:09.200 --> 01:12.333
- Es-Es-Es-Es--

01:12.333 --> 01:13.667
- Esme's here!

01:13.667 --> 01:16.067
Let's hit that snack table,
amigos!

01:16.067 --> 01:17.900
- Nacho time.

01:17.900 --> 01:21.367
- Helping your friend time.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.667
I don't understand
why you don't

01:22.667 --> 01:24.533
just talk to Esme
already, Lawrence.

01:24.533 --> 01:26.333
- But what if she
doesn't like me?

01:26.333 --> 01:27.833
- How could she not
like you?

01:27.833 --> 01:29.733
You're Spanish Club's
Hombre of the Month!

01:31.500 --> 01:34.900
- Either way,
go for it.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.067
- I can't.

01:36.067 --> 01:37.367
Whenever I try
to talk to her,

01:37.367 --> 01:39.800
I get so nervous,
I start sweating.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.600
- How bad could it be?

01:41.600 --> 01:44.067
Hombre up.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.833
- Oh.
Hi, Esme.

01:45.833 --> 01:50.733
That's a really nice, uh,
nose you're wearing.

01:50.733 --> 01:53.067
- Um, thanks?

01:53.067 --> 01:54.233
I got it from my parents.

01:54.233 --> 01:56.900
- Sure is a hot one
today, huh?

01:56.900 --> 01:58.433
- I'm cold actually.

01:58.433 --> 02:00.667
Weather guy said we're gonna
hit a record low.

02:00.667 --> 02:03.933
- Well, how about that?
I love weather.

02:11.133 --> 02:13.067
Well, bye!

02:13.067 --> 02:14.933
- See?
[chuckles]

02:14.933 --> 02:17.633
That wasn't so bad.

02:17.633 --> 02:18.767
- Really?

02:22.300 --> 02:25.633
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

02:25.633 --> 02:27.900
* It all adds up
to one thing *

02:27.900 --> 02:29.833
- Five, four, three,
two, one.

02:29.833 --> 02:32.133
- * If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

02:32.133 --> 02:34.900
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

02:34.900 --> 02:37.600
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

02:37.600 --> 02:40.133
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

02:40.133 --> 02:42.867
* If you're feeling like
you're gettin' schooled *

02:42.867 --> 02:45.400
* There's a answer
right in front of you *

02:45.400 --> 02:48.067
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

02:48.067 --> 02:49.833
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

02:49.833 --> 02:52.267
- * Hey!
- * Are you ready to rock?

02:55.867 --> 02:58.067
- All right, let's do this.
One, two--

02:58.067 --> 02:59.667
- Hang on a sec,
Mr. Finn.

02:59.667 --> 03:02.067
Freddy, I think your drums
sounded a little off yesterday.

03:02.067 --> 03:03.133
You should test 'em out.

03:03.133 --> 03:05.800
- What?
My drums sound fine.

03:07.833 --> 03:09.667
[laughter]

03:09.667 --> 03:12.333
- Milk?
Nice one, dude.

03:12.333 --> 03:13.700
You got me.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.133
- Okay, we're trying to see
who can pull

03:15.133 --> 03:16.867
the most epic band prank.

03:16.867 --> 03:19.067
- Guys, we don't have time
for pranks.

03:19.067 --> 03:20.767
We really need to rehearse.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.300
What the--
chocolate syrup?

03:23.300 --> 03:25.067
[laughter]

03:25.067 --> 03:28.067
- [groans]

03:28.067 --> 03:29.067
[laughter]

03:29.067 --> 03:30.300
- This isn't funny!

03:32.400 --> 03:33.700
Enough.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.467
Battle of the Bands
is two weeks away

03:35.467 --> 03:38.067
and we need every bit
of practice we can get.

03:38.067 --> 03:39.733
Plus, I have to rent
a new amp,

03:39.733 --> 03:41.367
I have to grade
your midterm papers,

03:41.367 --> 03:42.867
which apparently means
I have to read

03:42.867 --> 03:46.967
your midterm papers,
and I lost the keys to my van.

03:46.967 --> 03:48.067
[laughter]

03:48.067 --> 03:49.467
- Mr. Finn, you've got--

03:49.467 --> 03:51.067
- A lot to do,
I know!

03:51.067 --> 03:53.067
So let's just get
some rehearsal in

03:53.067 --> 03:54.167
before you have to go.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.333
[school bell rings]

03:55.333 --> 03:56.433
- We have to go.

03:56.433 --> 03:58.167
- What?

03:58.167 --> 03:59.567
- We have music class now,
you know,

03:59.567 --> 04:01.367
the real one the school
makes us go to.

04:01.367 --> 04:04.567
- Fine, go, but we're rehearsing
after school today,

04:04.567 --> 04:07.100
and every day
until Battle of the Bands.

04:07.100 --> 04:09.667
And Freddy, clean that milk
off your tie.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.467
Take some pride
in your appearance, buddy.

04:15.167 --> 04:18.167
[playing classical music]

04:18.167 --> 04:26.100

04:29.900 --> 04:32.800
- You've all gotten
so good!

04:32.800 --> 04:34.333
It's like you're
getting together

04:34.333 --> 04:36.333
and secretly
playing music.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.367
[all chuckle]

04:37.367 --> 04:39.733
- What?
That's crazy.

04:39.733 --> 04:41.667
Run to Mr. Finn's room
and burn everything.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.267
Burn it to the ground.

04:43.267 --> 04:45.933
- Take a breath,
Sparky.

04:45.933 --> 04:48.600
- I'm curious, how much
do you kids know about music

04:48.600 --> 04:50.300
from ancient times?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.700
- You mean like the '80s?

04:51.700 --> 04:54.667
My mom makes me listen
to Journey in the car.

04:54.667 --> 04:58.233
- No. I mean the music
prehistoric man played.

04:58.233 --> 05:03.167
I am an avid collector
of primeval instruments.

05:06.067 --> 05:08.533
- This isn't an instrument.
It's bones.

05:08.533 --> 05:10.167
- But if you smack them
together,

05:10.167 --> 05:12.733
you've got some
prehistoric percussion.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.333
- [coughs]

05:16.333 --> 05:18.100
I think I just tasted
caveman.

05:19.633 --> 05:21.667
- [screams]

05:21.667 --> 05:24.067
I'd really rather not
bang on this.

05:24.067 --> 05:26.333
- Oh, you don't
bang on that.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.600
That would be disgusting.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.433
You blow
into the eye hole.

05:29.433 --> 05:31.133
- Gotcha.
[chuckles]

05:31.133 --> 05:32.667
Which hole do I vomit in?

05:35.667 --> 05:37.200
- Let's see
what you can do.

[prehistoric music]

05:41.900 --> 05:49.700
*

05:49.700 --> 05:52.667
- I think I just found
my new band.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.167
- What?
both: Huh?

05:54.167 --> 05:56.067
- I've always wanted
to form a band that plays

05:56.067 --> 05:57.633
this kind of music,
and I think

05:57.633 --> 05:59.867
my dream might finally
be coming true.

05:59.867 --> 06:01.900
- Well, if it's optional--
- Not optional.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.967
We'll have our first practice
after school today,

06:03.967 --> 06:07.533
and if that goes well,
we'll practice every day.

06:07.533 --> 06:09.233
- But we have to
practice with Mr. Finn

06:09.233 --> 06:10.600
after school every day.

06:10.600 --> 06:11.933
- Don't worry.
I'll get us out of this.

06:11.933 --> 06:14.200
I'll just
turn on the Freddy charm.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.300
Uh, Ms. Ipson?

06:15.300 --> 06:17.067
- Hmm?

06:21.533 --> 06:24.233
- I gave it all I had.

06:28.233 --> 06:29.867
- What are you doing?

06:29.867 --> 06:32.533
- Come here,
you're gonna love this.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.067
It's show time.

06:34.067 --> 06:36.300
- Are you finally gonna
tell Esme you like her?

06:36.300 --> 06:39.300
- What?
No, I've got a way better plan.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.767
Why risk talking to her
and getting rejected

06:41.767 --> 06:44.267
when I can do it
the easy way?

06:46.100 --> 06:47.833
all: Whoa!

06:49.733 --> 06:52.700
- Wow.
What's the hard way?

06:52.700 --> 06:54.833
- Now all Esme has to do
is walk over

06:54.833 --> 06:56.767
and tell me
how much she likes me.

06:56.767 --> 06:59.200
- But she doesn't know
the birds were from you.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.200
I'm not sure you've
thought this through.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.600
- Tomika, please,
I fit 50 wild birds

07:03.600 --> 07:05.667
into a cramped locker.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.600
I'm pretty sure
I thought it through.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.733
[all screaming]

07:11.667 --> 07:13.733
- [screams]

07:15.500 --> 07:18.067
Good thing I didn't
go with the wild raccoons.

07:18.067 --> 07:20.833
Ahh!
Tomika, save yourself!

07:20.833 --> 07:23.067
Go on without me!

07:23.067 --> 07:25.200
- Way ahead of you,
bird boy!

- Ahh!

[rock music]

07:27.933 --> 07:29.800
- What are we gonna do
about music class?

07:29.800 --> 07:32.633
I can't handle
that weird ancient windbag.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.233
- Don't talk about Ms. Ipson
that way.

07:34.233 --> 07:37.900
- I was talking
about this ancient windbag.

07:37.900 --> 07:39.133
[windbag whines notes]

07:39.133 --> 07:42.267
- Ahh,
that sounds like Esme's laugh.

07:42.267 --> 07:43.700
- Um--

07:43.700 --> 07:46.867
- What?
It's cute when she does it.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.833
- We can't miss
Mr. Finn's practice.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.933
You saw how worked up
he got this morning.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.867
- I say we tell him the truth.
He'll understand.

07:52.867 --> 07:55.233
Besides, I've been working
on my skulling.

07:55.233 --> 07:56.633
I'm getting good.

07:56.633 --> 07:59.200
The key is jamming your thumb
in the nose hole.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.933
- The other key is
hand sanitizer.

08:02.933 --> 08:04.133
- We can't go running
to Mr. Finn

08:04.133 --> 08:05.400
to fix this problem
for us.

08:05.400 --> 08:07.100
He's already got
too much on his plate.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.633
- So we'll just
handle this ourselves.

08:09.633 --> 08:11.067
Why can't we be
the adults?

08:11.067 --> 08:12.567
- Yeah,
we're responsible.

08:12.567 --> 08:13.633
- We make good decisions.

08:13.633 --> 08:15.100
- I'm growing a mustache.

08:16.433 --> 08:19.067
- Are you growing it
on someone else's face?

08:19.067 --> 08:22.767
- The point is,
we can do this.

08:22.767 --> 08:25.067
- Yes.
- So agreed, we can do it.

08:25.067 --> 08:27.900
All we need is a plan.

08:27.900 --> 08:30.133
- What if we go
to Ms. Ipson's practice,

08:30.133 --> 08:32.967
but we play terribly?
Like, crazy bad.

08:32.967 --> 08:34.767
She'll realize
we're not her dream band

08:34.767 --> 08:36.533
and call off
the whole thing.

08:36.533 --> 08:37.933
- That's perfect.

08:37.933 --> 08:40.133
In the meantime,
we just need to make up excuses

08:40.133 --> 08:43.100
to tell Mr. Finn
why we can't rehearse today.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.700
- Hey, guys.

08:44.700 --> 08:45.967
What you talking about?

08:45.967 --> 08:47.567
- Nothing!
I mean, something of course.

08:47.567 --> 08:48.800
You can't talk
about nothing,

08:48.800 --> 08:50.067
or else you're talking
about something.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.333
Help.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.600
- Lawrence, are you okay?

08:53.600 --> 08:56.100
- Uh, no!
He is super sick.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.767
Mr. Finn,
he should go home.

08:57.767 --> 08:58.933
- I'm not sick.

08:58.933 --> 09:01.100
- Oh, it's worse
than we thought.

09:01.100 --> 09:03.933
One of the symptoms is
thinking you're not sick.

09:03.933 --> 09:06.167
I don't think
I'm sick either.

09:06.167 --> 09:08.633
Oh, no,
it's spreading!

09:08.633 --> 09:10.933

09:10.933 --> 09:12.433
- This is really bad,
Mr. Finn.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.933
I think we all have to miss
today's rehearsal.

09:14.933 --> 09:17.133

Mr. Finn?

09:17.133 --> 09:21.800

09:32.167 --> 09:35.567
- Wow!
We sound pretty bad.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.400
- Stink City.
We understand

09:37.400 --> 09:40.200
if you don't want us to be
in your band, Ms. Ipson.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.533
- This was
a horrible mistake.

09:42.533 --> 09:43.767
- Really?

09:43.767 --> 09:45.100
- We should have formed
this band

09:45.100 --> 09:47.333
at the beginning
of the school year.

09:47.333 --> 09:49.567
[slams keyboard]

09:49.567 --> 09:51.667
- Oops, sorry.

09:51.667 --> 09:55.100
- That song moved me.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.067
Nobody knows what
early man's music

09:57.067 --> 10:00.133
sounded like, so it's
open to interpretation.

10:00.133 --> 10:03.600
Your music made me feel
like a cave woman,

10:03.600 --> 10:06.067
running from
a saber-toothed tiger.

10:06.067 --> 10:08.733
- That's how I feel
when I give my cat a bath.

10:09.733 --> 10:11.400
- This is so exciting.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.433
We're setting up a concert
this week for the entire school.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.067
- Our plan isn't working.

10:17.067 --> 10:19.133
We can't be in her band
and School of Rock.

10:19.133 --> 10:20.967
- Don't panic,
I got this.

10:20.967 --> 10:22.667
Uh, Ms. Ipson?

10:22.667 --> 10:23.933
- Hmm?

10:27.133 --> 10:30.267
I can't even make my face smile.
Everything is falling apart!

10:31.867 --> 10:33.667
- We should also invite
Principal Mullins

10:33.667 --> 10:35.200
to the concert.
We need her approval

10:35.200 --> 10:37.333
in order to be
an official band,

10:37.333 --> 10:39.467
and then we'll have more
concerts and more rehearsals.

10:39.467 --> 10:43.233
From now on, this band
is going to be your life.

10:43.233 --> 10:45.733
- [groans loudly]

10:45.733 --> 10:48.167
- Zack, stop playing
that windbag.

10:48.167 --> 10:49.667
- I wasn't.

10:49.667 --> 10:52.167
[groans loudly]

10:55.433 --> 10:57.733
[rock music]

10:57.733 --> 10:59.167
- What are we gonna do?

10:59.167 --> 11:01.167
This ancient band
is going to ruin our lives.

11:01.167 --> 11:03.100
- Nothing good came
from ancient music.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.600
Everyone who ever
played it is dead.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.100
- How could this get
any worse?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.667
- Your teacher could
catch you.

11:08.667 --> 11:09.833
- Yeah, but that's
unlikely.

11:09.833 --> 11:12.800
Mr. Finn's not
the smartest--

11:12.800 --> 11:14.400
Mr. Finn, we were just
talking about you.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.733
all: Hey!

11:16.733 --> 11:18.967
[all laughing]

11:19.900 --> 11:22.900
[rock music]

11:22.900 --> 11:25.433
- Sorry we lied to you,
Mr. Finn.

11:25.433 --> 11:27.833
- We were just trying
to deal with this on our own.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.500
- Well, that didn't work,

11:29.500 --> 11:32.067
and now I've got
a concert to stop.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.667
Oh, why did this
have to happen now?

11:33.667 --> 11:35.800
We got so much going on!

11:35.800 --> 11:37.433
[sighs]
Don't worry.

11:37.433 --> 11:38.433
I'll deal with it.

11:38.433 --> 11:39.867
[knocking at the door]

11:39.867 --> 11:40.900
- Looking for Dewey Finn.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.067
- Oh, good,
the amp delivery.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.067
Lamps?

11:48.067 --> 11:49.700
I said amps!
[scoffs]

11:49.700 --> 11:51.700
What kind of store
do you guys run?

11:51.700 --> 11:52.800
- Lamp store.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.267
- [growls]

11:54.267 --> 11:57.133
This is another thing
I've got to sort out.

11:58.767 --> 12:01.967
I'll be fine.
Excuse me.

12:03.133 --> 12:05.267
I hate my life!

12:07.333 --> 12:09.767
- You guys, I don't think
Mr. Finn can handle

12:09.767 --> 12:11.233
our problem right now.

12:11.233 --> 12:13.300
We need to fix this Ipson thing
ourselves.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.933
- I don't know,
maybe Mr. Finn will

12:14.933 --> 12:16.300
be able
to figure this out.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.500
- I can't figure
anything out!

12:19.667 --> 12:21.533
- Yeah, let's fix it
ourselves.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.933
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:22.933 --> 12:26.133
[rock music]

12:26.133 --> 12:30.667
- Look at her.
Everything she does is magical.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.400
- [sneezing]

12:33.400 --> 12:34.833
[blows nose]

12:34.833 --> 12:37.600
- Oh, to be that hanky.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.667
This has gone on
long enough.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.067
I'm finally going to
tell Esme how I feel.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.467
- You go, Lawrence!

12:44.467 --> 12:46.600
I'm proud of you for being brave
and talking to her.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.667
- Oh, I'm not gonna
talk to her.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.100
[over PA system]
Attention, Esme.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.500
You light up my world.

12:57.500 --> 13:01.067
Now I'm going to
light up yours.

13:01.933 --> 13:03.467
[students murmuring]

13:03.467 --> 13:04.400
- Wow!

13:08.367 --> 13:12.067
- "Esme, I like you"?
That's incredible!

13:12.067 --> 13:14.233
What amazing person
would do that?

13:15.467 --> 13:17.333
- I did!

13:17.333 --> 13:20.067
I am that amazing person!

13:20.067 --> 13:21.100
both: What?

13:21.100 --> 13:22.633
- Thank you so much,
Clark.

13:22.633 --> 13:25.433
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

13:26.733 --> 13:29.067
- You lose.

13:29.067 --> 13:31.633
- Really?
You made that light show?

13:31.633 --> 13:35.100
Why don't you prove it, and do
another light show right now?

13:35.100 --> 13:38.833
- Please, another light show
would be pathetic.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.067
Right, Esme?

13:40.067 --> 13:41.433
- I guess.

13:41.433 --> 13:42.800
- Yeah, totally.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.733
Two light shows?
How desperate.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.067
Can you excuse me?

13:51.567 --> 13:54.300
Take it down!
Take it all down!

13:56.733 --> 13:58.667
[rock music]

13:58.667 --> 14:00.767
- We figured out a way
to use today's concert

14:00.767 --> 14:04.467
to make this ancient music band
go away for good.

14:04.467 --> 14:06.100
- Ms. Ipson said
Principal Mullins

14:06.100 --> 14:08.467
needs to sign off on the band
to make it official, right?

14:08.467 --> 14:10.133
Well, what does
Principal Mullins hate

14:10.133 --> 14:12.433
more than anything
in the world?

14:12.433 --> 14:15.167
- The laughter
of children?

14:15.167 --> 14:16.900
- No, she hates when things
aren't perfect.

14:16.900 --> 14:18.400
She totally flips out.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.367
- Which is why she will freak
when she sees this!

14:28.233 --> 14:31.067
- Okay, this is us.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.600
- How come I'm a girl?

14:33.600 --> 14:35.800
- Sorry, they ran out
of guy mannequins.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.700
- How come you can't
be the girl?

14:38.700 --> 14:41.067
- Dude, come on.

14:41.067 --> 14:43.900
- So the plan is
mannequins?

14:43.900 --> 14:46.167
- No, the plan is
booby traps.

14:46.167 --> 14:47.533
- Better get
out of the way.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.733
- Oh.

14:52.067 --> 14:53.233
- Whoa.

14:53.233 --> 14:54.367
- Cannon.

14:56.767 --> 14:59.767
- At the concert,
those will be flying tomatoes.

14:59.767 --> 15:01.700
- And for the finale.

15:03.567 --> 15:06.233
At the concert,
that'll be paint.

15:06.233 --> 15:07.933
- [laughs]
- Principal Mullins will hate

15:07.933 --> 15:10.367
the concert so much, she'll shut
the ancient music band down.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.800
- And Mr. Finn
will be impressed

15:11.800 --> 15:13.533
that we handled it on our own
like grown-ups.

15:13.533 --> 15:14.700
- It's the perfect plan.

15:15.767 --> 15:17.600
- [screams]

15:17.600 --> 15:20.600
- This is why we practice,
people.

15:20.600 --> 15:22.533
[rock music]

15:23.800 --> 15:25.867
- [humming]

15:27.133 --> 15:28.667
Why are you eating lunch
in here, buddy?

15:28.667 --> 15:31.700
- I couldn't stand watching
Esme eat with Clark.

15:31.700 --> 15:35.067
Everything I've done to make her
like me has gone wrong.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.800
- Mm.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.400
- This would be
a good time to say,

15:41.400 --> 15:44.667
"Don't worry, everything's
gonna be okay."

15:44.667 --> 15:47.167
- Everything's not
gonna be okay.

15:47.167 --> 15:48.667
- Wow, Mr. Finn,

15:48.667 --> 15:51.900
your pep talks have taken
a really sinister turn.

15:51.900 --> 15:55.100
- I mean not until you
tell Esme how you feel.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.567
No more gestures.

15:56.567 --> 15:59.633
You gotta stand in front of her,
look her in the eye,

15:59.633 --> 16:01.367
say the words.

16:01.367 --> 16:03.500
Look, Lawrence,
you're an amazing guy--

16:03.500 --> 16:05.633
- Slow down,
this is good stuff.

16:05.633 --> 16:08.133
"Esme, you're
an amazing guy."

16:08.133 --> 16:10.133
- Gotta be your words, pal.

16:10.133 --> 16:13.267
I know it's scary,
but if you don't take the risk,

16:13.267 --> 16:17.067
you'll never know
if she likes you back.

16:17.067 --> 16:19.267
- You're right.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.500
Thanks, Mr. Finn.

16:22.500 --> 16:25.633
- Anytime.
It's what I'm here for.

16:34.067 --> 16:36.367
It's still good.

16:36.367 --> 16:38.567
[rock music]

16:40.267 --> 16:41.933
- Thank you for coming,
Principal Mullins.

16:41.933 --> 16:44.400
I promise you are
going to love these kids

16:44.400 --> 16:46.900
and want them to be
an official school band.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.633
- Well, they're kids.
I'm not asking for perfection.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.467
- Oh--
- Uh--I expect it,

16:51.467 --> 16:52.667
but I'd never ask for it.

16:55.367 --> 16:57.467
- Guys,
about the concert--

16:57.467 --> 16:59.800
- Don't worry, Mr. Finn,
we're handling it.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.433
[laughter]

17:01.433 --> 17:04.833
- [laughs]

17:04.833 --> 17:07.133
I don't know why
we're laughing.

17:07.133 --> 17:09.300
- Uh, well, we booby-trapped
the stage.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.833
The concert's going to be
a disaster.

17:10.833 --> 17:13.167
- Principal Mullins will hate it
and end the band.

17:13.167 --> 17:14.300
Isn't that a great plan?

17:14.300 --> 17:16.533
- No, it's a terrible plan.

17:16.533 --> 17:18.200
What was going
through your heads?

17:18.200 --> 17:20.067
- Well, we saw how busy
you were.

17:20.067 --> 17:21.633
We had to do something.

17:21.633 --> 17:24.467
- So we decided to be the adults
and take care of this ourselves.

17:24.467 --> 17:25.733
- Yeah, we're practically
grown-ups.

17:25.733 --> 17:27.733
Have you seen
Zack's mustache?

17:29.167 --> 17:30.867
- 'Sup?

17:30.867 --> 17:34.400
- Guys, you're not grown-ups,
I'm the grown-up.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.200
It's okay to ask
grown-ups for help.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.400
Even if I seem busy,
I'm never too busy for you.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.967
In fact, I--

17:40.967 --> 17:44.300
- Excuse me, everybody,
we have a special performance.

17:47.933 --> 17:50.500
- Before the show starts,
I'd like to sing a song I wrote

17:50.500 --> 17:54.133
for the coolest, smartest,
prettiest girl I know.

17:54.133 --> 17:55.267
It's called "Esme."

17:57.900 --> 17:59.233
[plays a single chord]

17:59.233 --> 18:01.600
Just to be clear,
it's about you, Esme.

18:03.167 --> 18:05.233
And this is how I feel.

18:05.233 --> 18:08.233
[plays wistful piano]

18:08.233 --> 18:10.633
*

18:10.633 --> 18:13.833
- * I wanted to tell you
something *

18:13.833 --> 18:16.833
* So I tried way after way

18:16.833 --> 18:22.067
* But I just can't hide
what I kept inside *

18:22.067 --> 18:27.533
* So here's what
I wanted to say *

18:28.667 --> 18:32.333
* You make me smile

18:32.333 --> 18:36.733
* Make my whole day worthwhile

18:36.733 --> 18:38.200
*

18:38.200 --> 18:39.733
- Oh, no, the booby traps!

18:39.733 --> 18:42.633
- Don't worry, Mr. Finn,
as long as nobody trips the wi--

18:42.633 --> 18:45.700
- I think I just
tripped the wi--

18:45.700 --> 18:47.400
- We've gotta
save Lawrence!

18:47.400 --> 18:48.833
- Mr. Finn, tomato cannon!

18:48.833 --> 18:49.767
- [gasps]

18:50.833 --> 18:52.367
- [winces]

18:53.233 --> 18:54.633
- Now in Spanish.

18:54.633 --> 19:00.400
* [singing in Spanish]

19:00.400 --> 19:01.967
*

19:01.967 --> 19:03.467
- Oh! No!

19:03.467 --> 19:06.133
- * I like your eyes
and your nose *

19:06.133 --> 19:08.933
- Don't--over there.
Throw it away!

19:08.933 --> 19:12.167
- * I like the way you smile
at people anywhere *

19:12.167 --> 19:16.133
* You might sneeze a bit
but I don't mind *

19:16.133 --> 19:17.233
* Because you're sunny *

19:17.233 --> 19:18.767
- The sandbag!
- Mr. Finn!

19:18.767 --> 19:21.467
- * You're one of a kind *

19:21.467 --> 19:24.900
* Yeah, you make me smile

19:24.900 --> 19:29.467
* Make my whole day worthwhile

19:29.467 --> 19:30.500
*

19:30.500 --> 19:33.767
* Yeah, you

19:33.767 --> 19:38.300
* You make me smile

19:38.300 --> 19:41.433
[cheers and applause]

19:46.300 --> 19:49.300
[dramatic music]

19:49.300 --> 19:54.100
*

19:58.400 --> 20:00.000
- [sighs]

20:00.000 --> 20:02.200
Keep it going for Lawrence,
everybody!

20:02.200 --> 20:05.367
[cheers and applause]

20:05.367 --> 20:07.500
- That was fantastic!

20:07.500 --> 20:09.267
And all those
choreographed stunts

20:09.267 --> 20:10.400
going off
in the background

20:10.400 --> 20:13.300
really added to the drama
of the moment!

20:13.300 --> 20:15.800
- [laughing]
Yeah, choreographed.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.767
Well, I guess
the show's over.

20:17.767 --> 20:18.867
- Yeah.

20:18.867 --> 20:19.967
- Oh, no, no,

20:19.967 --> 20:22.567
I-I wanted to hear
this ancient music.

20:22.567 --> 20:25.167
[all groan]

20:25.167 --> 20:26.267
- I guess we blew it.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.567
- We're doomed.

20:29.067 --> 20:30.600
- I'm Hanz Glassmeier

20:30.600 --> 20:33.233
from the National Museum
of Modern Prehistory,

20:33.233 --> 20:36.900
also known as N.M.M.P.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.967
This school is using
ancient artifacts

20:39.967 --> 20:42.867
as musical instruments,
a direct violation

20:42.867 --> 20:46.367
of the Federal Fossil
Fragment Preservation Act,

20:46.367 --> 20:49.233
or FFF-PA.

20:49.233 --> 20:51.800
Excuse me.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.067
- Ms. Ipson?

20:53.067 --> 20:55.067
You're violating F-F-F-PA?

20:55.067 --> 20:57.967
- [chuckles]
I-I just liked the music.

20:57.967 --> 20:59.800
I didn't know
we weren't allowed--

20:59.800 --> 21:02.767
- I have a court injunction
ordering you

21:02.767 --> 21:05.433
to shut this band down!

21:08.067 --> 21:11.233
- Children, I'm sorry.
Your band has to break up.

21:11.233 --> 21:12.233
- No.

21:12.233 --> 21:13.500
all: Yay!

21:13.500 --> 21:16.133
- Oh.
all: Aww!

21:17.500 --> 21:19.100
- Do you want to pay me
right now, bro,

21:19.100 --> 21:21.233
or you want to meet me
late night at the graveyard?

21:21.233 --> 21:22.433
- Just go, Scabs.

21:22.433 --> 21:24.167
- All right, okay.

21:24.167 --> 21:26.067
Excuse me.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.467
- You did this?

21:27.467 --> 21:29.067
- Told you I was gonna
take care of it.

21:29.067 --> 21:31.233
- You have a friend
named Scabs?

21:31.233 --> 21:33.100
- I have two, actually.

21:34.467 --> 21:35.600
Okay.

21:36.567 --> 21:37.733
- Ho ho!
- Yeah.

21:37.733 --> 21:40.300
- That song was so cool,
Lawrence.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.567
- I'm proud of you,
L-Train.

21:41.567 --> 21:42.833
- Such a baller move, dude.

21:42.833 --> 21:44.400
If I'm ever into a girl
that much,

21:44.400 --> 21:46.300
I'm totally gonna
steal that idea.

21:46.300 --> 21:47.867
- Ohh, I can't wait.

21:47.867 --> 21:52.067
I mean, to hear how Esme
liked the song.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.333
- I loved the song.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.067
- Oh, hi, Esme.

21:55.067 --> 21:57.067
- Did you mean
all those things you said?

21:57.067 --> 21:58.133
- Of course.

21:58.133 --> 22:00.767
- Good,
'cause I like you too.

22:00.767 --> 22:04.433
[romantic music]

22:04.433 --> 22:07.433
- Adios, Clar-r-rk.

22:07.433 --> 22:09.733
[rock music]
