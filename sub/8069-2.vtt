[music playing]

00:58.892 --> 01:00.761
What are you reading?

01:00.794 --> 01:03.264
My police manual.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.398
What?

01:04.432 --> 01:06.600
You know, I could
be making $3,000

01:06.634 --> 01:09.137
a month if I get accepted.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.371
Oh, you're joking.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.774
No, I already applied.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.644
- Knock, knock, anybody home?
- Cut it out.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.880
I'll have you arrested for
assaulting a future officer.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.115
You're duping on me, right?

01:21.149 --> 01:24.051
No, not that I know of.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.853
You mean to tell me that
you went ahead and did this

01:25.886 --> 01:27.621
without even talking to me?

01:27.655 --> 01:28.889
God, Roseanne.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.425
Can't you show a little
enthusiasm for me?

01:31.459 --> 01:32.926
I'm excited about this.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.729
Well, if I was to show
enthusiasm every time

01:35.763 --> 01:39.333
you got excited, I would run
out of enthusiasm by the time

01:39.367 --> 01:42.303
I was 6.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.037
I knew I shouldn't have
said anything about it.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.273
I just should have
come over one day,

01:45.306 --> 01:48.776
cuffed you, gagged you,
told you, and left.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.578
Well, don't you even
want to know what I think?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.713
No, I don't.

01:52.746 --> 01:56.116
OK, well, I'll tell
you what I don't think.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.952
I don't think
you're cop material.

01:58.986 --> 02:01.155
Oh, yeah.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.924
You don't, ah?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.827
You don't even know
what cop material is.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.965
How [inaudible] now, Roseanne?

02:11.999 --> 02:13.867
Let's see you get out of that.

02:13.901 --> 02:17.305
Don't think I'm cop
material now, ha!

02:17.338 --> 02:19.139
You are messing up my hair.

02:22.876 --> 02:27.781
I am releasing you on
your own recognizance.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.082
You know, being
a cop is something

02:29.116 --> 02:32.786
that takes a lot of commitment--
not your strong point.

02:32.820 --> 02:36.156
And besides that, you're
not a kid anymore, Jackie.

02:36.190 --> 02:39.793
Look, just 'cause you may not
want me to do it, doesn't mean

02:39.827 --> 02:41.495
that I don't want to do it.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.131
Well, you you don't even
know what you're doing.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.633
Roseanne, goodbye.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.934
Oh, Jackie, grow up.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.202
Oh, go to hell.

02:48.236 --> 02:49.169
[slams door]

02:49.203 --> 02:51.104
This is hell.

02:51.138 --> 02:53.441
[transition music]

02:58.011 --> 02:59.179
I'm really worried about her.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.614
I just hope she
doesn't get accepted.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.550
Oh, they'll accept
her, all right.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.984
Based on what?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.619
Based on the fact
that the Lanford Police

03:05.653 --> 03:08.188
Department is run by a
bunch of bozos, half of whom

03:08.222 --> 03:10.324
your sister's dated.

03:10.358 --> 03:13.894
Don't talk about
my sister like that.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.230
That's my job.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.130
Mm.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.466
Unbelievable.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.133
That chili is going to be
hanging from the ceiling

03:20.167 --> 03:22.102
on the Smithsonian.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.438
Summon the children, Fifi.

03:24.472 --> 03:27.341
Fam!

03:27.375 --> 03:29.142
I thought Jackie
will stay for dinner.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.245
Ah, she was mad at me.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.646
I'm mad at you,
and I stuck around.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.218
I'm mad at you because
I got my hair cut today,

03:38.252 --> 03:39.287
and you didn't even notice.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.621
I did so notice, Mo.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.893
Why do you think I'm mad at you?

03:45.926 --> 03:48.028
Ah, spread out.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.430
[funny noise]

03:49.463 --> 03:51.299
Liar!

03:51.332 --> 03:53.200
Darlene, you used it,
didn't you, little twerp?

03:53.233 --> 03:54.302
No, I didn't.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.036
Why don't you just
tell the truth for once?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.037
OK, I will.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.772
The truth is you're a dink.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.974
We are family.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.043
Don't you ever touch
my things again, Darlene.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.745
I got all my sisters with me.

04:04.778 --> 04:05.846
I'll touch whatever I want.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.749
Oh, no, not chili.

04:08.782 --> 04:12.019
Not just any chili,
my famous chili,

04:12.052 --> 04:16.290
just Dan Conner's magic chili,
with the freshest ingredients

04:16.324 --> 04:18.158
straight from the
Conner family barn.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.461
I want fish sticks.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.796
Wow, it's nice
to have a dream.

04:22.830 --> 04:26.700
Tonight we'll try a
variation on my classic recipe,

04:26.734 --> 04:29.069
[inaudible] style.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.876
Oh, gross, how can
I drink out of it.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.311
You put your finger in it.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.313
Don't worry, Dorkie,
this finger's clean.

04:39.347 --> 04:42.916
I had it in my nose all day.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.285
You are such a little twerp.

04:45.319 --> 04:46.487
I'm embarrassed we're related.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.155
At least I'm not a pervert.

04:48.188 --> 04:51.024
You are disgusting.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.226
Yeah, but I'm not the one
who was reading dad's magazine,

04:53.260 --> 04:54.061
Beckie.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.868
Shut up.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.770
Hush up, come on,
we're having dinner here.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.542
What magazine?

05:08.576 --> 05:11.044
Girls, girls, girls.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.414
Dan, Dan, Dan.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.882
Honey, I know what
you're going to say,

05:14.915 --> 05:16.249
and you're absolutely right.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.552
But I just don't think you can
say it in front of children.

05:18.586 --> 05:21.755
You have such a big mouth.

05:21.789 --> 05:25.593
You know, Darlene, it's
not nice to tag on people,

05:25.626 --> 05:27.561
especially people who
do really stupid things

05:27.595 --> 05:28.862
that they know
they shouldn't do.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.297
Ow.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.233
Darlene is a
tattle-tale, tattle-tale.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.470
Darlene, DJ's right, you
shouldn't rat on people.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.106
And you should keep your mitts
off other people's belongings.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.674
Hey, everybody, calm down.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.643
Your mother's
right, listen to her.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.245
She's been busting her hump
all day cooking and cleaning.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.680
She doesn't need
this aggravation.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.883
Would you like a little
wine with dinner, honey?

05:49.917 --> 05:50.984
Forget about it, Dan.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.686
I took a shot.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.055
I thought I told you
to take that magazine

05:55.088 --> 05:56.189
and get it out of this house.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.090
It is out of the house.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.259
It's in the garage.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.094
It's not like it
was in the trash.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.563
It was right in your workbench.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.697
Right.

06:03.731 --> 06:07.468
My work bench, as in,
my private work bench.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.869
Yeah, Becky.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.003
Oh, quiet.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.972
You're the one who
started this whole thing.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.441
Instead of picking
on me, why don't

06:13.474 --> 06:16.076
you ask Becky what he was doing
looking at that nudie magazine?

06:16.109 --> 06:17.611
Shut up, Darlene.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.246
You want to be like
those girls, don't you?

06:19.279 --> 06:20.147
Shut up.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.649
You know you do.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.584
Why don't you show mom
and dad your sexy walk?

06:26.420 --> 06:27.521
I hate you, Darlene.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.356
Ow, you sexy thing.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.464
What?

06:36.497 --> 06:37.931
Snitch.

06:37.965 --> 06:39.299
What about Becky?

06:39.332 --> 06:40.768
We're talking about you.

06:40.801 --> 06:41.669
Oh, you're right.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.103
Becky never does anything wrong.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.972
Everything is always my fault.

06:45.005 --> 06:49.543
No, just the stuff that's
happened since you were born.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.044
Will you apologize
to your sister?

06:51.078 --> 06:51.945
No way.

06:51.979 --> 06:52.913
[dj laughs]

06:52.946 --> 06:54.081
Shut up.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.316
Hey, don't hit your
brother when he's eating.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.785
I'm sick of this stupid house.

06:57.818 --> 06:59.753
I can't do anything right.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.322
Darlene, Darlene, where
do you think you're going?

07:02.355 --> 07:03.223
DARLENE: [slams door]

07:03.256 --> 07:04.057
We handled that well.

07:06.827 --> 07:10.864
What disgusting thing
are you reading now?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.265
The Growth of our Nation.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.867
Ew, you are a pervert.

07:27.481 --> 07:28.916
What?

07:28.949 --> 07:33.153
I just want to know why
men like these magazines.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.122
I mean, why do they want
to look at a bunch of women

07:35.155 --> 07:36.657
who they don't even know.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.927
Well, Becky, they
actually believe those women

07:39.960 --> 07:42.496
are looking back at them.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.766
Why do you think those
girls' fathers say to that?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.868
Well, they probably
don't say too much, which

07:47.901 --> 07:49.369
is probably one
of the reasons why

07:49.402 --> 07:52.305
they end up in those magazines.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.742
I feel bad for them.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.144
Yeah, me too.

08:06.386 --> 08:11.024
Hey, do you know that women
didn't get to vote until 1920?

08:11.058 --> 08:13.594
Yeah, and as I
recall, we all voted no.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.805
I mean, according to
mom, Becky's always good,

08:24.838 --> 08:26.607
and I'm always bad.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.877
Like, if Becky gets an A, it's
a big deal, but if I get an A,

08:29.910 --> 08:31.945
mom just ignores it.

08:31.979 --> 08:35.215
You got an A?

08:35.248 --> 08:38.385
No, but if I did, she would.

08:38.418 --> 08:41.354
And you what Becky's
favorite thing to say is?

08:41.388 --> 08:42.690
Grow up.

08:42.723 --> 08:46.159
You know where she gets
that from, from your mom.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.928
Well, it's not fair.

08:47.961 --> 08:51.031
Life is unfair.

08:51.064 --> 08:57.805
Life is this big unfair thing.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.773
Well, one day I'm
going to get even.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.409
I'm going to have a neat
place, just like this,

09:02.442 --> 09:04.544
and I'm never going
to invite her over.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.046
Yeah, you will.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.447
That's what's unfair.

09:07.480 --> 09:13.020
You're her sister, and you're
never going to get rid of her.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.957
Well, if I hear grow
up one more time, boom,

09:16.990 --> 09:19.226
I'm not going to have a sister.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.694
Me either.

09:20.728 --> 09:24.564
I went over there today
from my house to her house

09:24.598 --> 09:28.736
with a dream, a little dream.

09:28.769 --> 09:34.107
And she took that dream
and she stomped it.

09:34.141 --> 09:39.412
And after she stomped it,
she kicked it in the gutter.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.882
Well, she probably
didn't mean it.

09:41.915 --> 09:49.289
That your mom's way of being
in control, all the time,

09:49.322 --> 09:51.992
constantly.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.427
But let's face it,
without your mom,

09:54.461 --> 09:59.266
life as we know it would end.

09:59.299 --> 10:03.070
Well, if she's so important,
how come she can't get a job?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.037
That's right.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.107
Your mom didn't
even have the brains

10:07.140 --> 10:10.678
to say yes to your
dad when your dad

10:10.711 --> 10:13.814
asked your mom to marry me--

10:13.847 --> 10:15.582
her, Dan.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.550
You know what I mean?

10:17.584 --> 10:21.054
But little Jackie, who,
according to your mom,

10:21.088 --> 10:26.226
can't even balance a check
book, which, by the way,

10:26.259 --> 10:31.031
I had a checking account
long before she ever

10:31.064 --> 10:34.434
did because I went
down to Great Rock Bank

10:34.467 --> 10:41.574
and got a check book, by myself,
without any help from her.

10:41.608 --> 10:46.714
And they had this
really gross security

10:46.747 --> 10:49.149
guard their named Eddy.

10:49.182 --> 10:54.988
And your mom and I used
to call Eddy Spaghetti.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.230
And you know something, Mel.

11:03.263 --> 11:07.735
I had to tell her what a great
catch she'd be passing up.

11:07.768 --> 11:11.138
And your mom is the one that
can't even balance a checkbook.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.340
If she's so good with
money, how come I

11:13.373 --> 11:15.275
always have to lend her money?

11:15.308 --> 11:19.312
I bought that glove they
paid for you last year.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.213
Thanks.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.149
Really?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.083
Well, that's OK.

11:27.154 --> 11:32.559
That's what sisters are for.

11:32.592 --> 11:35.628
You want something to drink?

11:35.662 --> 11:36.797
No, thanks.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.732
Well, I'm going to
get a little something.

11:38.766 --> 11:39.599
Oh.

11:39.632 --> 11:40.700
Jackie.

11:40.734 --> 11:44.037
Oh, there's all kinds
of gravity in here.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.843
I gotta get my sea legs.

11:52.612 --> 11:53.546
You know what?

11:53.580 --> 11:58.685
You are always
welcome in my house.

11:58.718 --> 12:03.791
And so am I. You know what?

12:03.824 --> 12:13.566
I am going to go and take a
little nap just for one minute.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.534
OK, Roseanne?

12:14.567 --> 12:16.904
[phone ringing]
- Should I get that?

12:20.607 --> 12:21.909
Hello?

12:21.942 --> 12:24.377
Mom.

12:24.411 --> 12:28.015
Mm, everything's fine.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.750
Aunt Jackie and I
are just talking,

12:30.784 --> 12:34.187
and having a great time.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.924
I'm going to spend
the night, OK.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.725
I feel a lot better.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.626
Yeah.

12:39.659 --> 12:40.460
Bye.

12:44.431 --> 12:48.335
I am a good cop.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.911
I'm serious, mother, bacon
is loaded with sodium, nitrite,

12:57.945 --> 13:00.981
grease, and animal fat.

13:01.014 --> 13:01.915
Breakfast!

13:04.952 --> 13:06.419
[inaudible].

13:06.453 --> 13:07.487
Straight.
Straight.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.388
Straight.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.857
Wait!

13:09.890 --> 13:10.858
Left.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.125
Straight.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.594
Straight, straight down.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.864
Drop that pig meat, cover hog.

13:16.897 --> 13:17.865
- Cover hog?
- Yeah.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.266
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.233
Yeah?

13:20.267 --> 13:21.201
Yeah.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.170
All right.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.138
Baby, we missing an offspring?

13:25.172 --> 13:26.606
Yeah, where do you
think I got the bacon?

13:32.512 --> 13:33.380
Three pieces?

13:33.413 --> 13:34.882
Hey, I didn't get any.

13:34.915 --> 13:35.916
Hypocrite.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.153
Two pieces?

13:40.187 --> 13:42.589
Well, just 'cause you bring
home the bacon, don't mean

13:42.622 --> 13:45.058
you get to eat it all.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.594
Gee, Roseanne, I
guess you told me.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.330
Oh, I guess I did.

13:50.363 --> 13:54.034
Well, if you're so smart, let
me ask you one thing, quiz kid.

13:54.067 --> 13:57.137
How come your face is so smooth
this way and so rough that way?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.906
Ah.

13:58.939 --> 14:03.911
What did I tell you about food
playing in front of the kid?

14:03.944 --> 14:05.278
Hey, come here, you.

14:09.449 --> 14:10.350
Darlene.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.251
There's more.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.319
No, there isn't.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.488
Oh, here, take it.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.224
So did you have fun last night?

14:17.257 --> 14:18.158
Yeah.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.559
What did you
guys end up doing?

14:19.592 --> 14:21.995
Oh, we drove into Chicago and
picked up a couple of sailors.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.366
Darlene, get a plane.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.101
I'm serious.

14:28.135 --> 14:29.702
Look, ain't that
Halley's Comet?

14:29.736 --> 14:30.570
Forget about it.

14:36.309 --> 14:41.514
So-- what did you guys
talk about last night?

14:41.548 --> 14:42.882
Me?

14:42.916 --> 14:45.285
What did your Aunt Jackie say?

14:45.318 --> 14:46.386
Ask her yourself.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.355
I'm not a tattletale.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.523
Well, you know, it's
not really tattling if I

14:50.557 --> 14:53.260
have to beat it out of you.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.727
Hey.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.163
[door opens]

15:01.201 --> 15:03.470
Hey, kid, thanks for
putting the pail by the bed.

15:06.239 --> 15:11.578
Oh, look, Aunt Jackie had
her hangover glasses on.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.114
Was she drinking last night?

15:14.147 --> 15:16.283
Did you get drunk while
my kid was over there?

15:16.316 --> 15:19.652
No, I was drunk before
she got over there.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.754
Darlene, would you like
to help me work on the boat?

15:21.788 --> 15:22.990
No, not really.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.791
So would your brother
and sister, come on.

15:28.861 --> 15:31.864
What do you mean going
and getting plowed?

15:31.898 --> 15:33.500
What is your problem?

15:33.533 --> 15:37.170
You, you, you are my problem.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.638
Oh, what did I do now?

15:38.671 --> 15:41.108
Same thing as you
always do, Roseanne, you

15:41.141 --> 15:44.644
sit up there on your pedestal.

15:44.677 --> 15:45.845
Yeah.

15:45.878 --> 15:50.417
Act like some big high
and mighty, self-righteous

15:50.450 --> 15:54.254
pedestal type person.

15:54.287 --> 15:58.658
And you poo-poo
everything in my life.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.161
Yeah, and you go
right for your addictive

16:01.194 --> 16:06.799
behavior because you
cannot handle conflict.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.968
That is whole thing, you
cannot handle conflict.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.671
Remember we saw the
whole thing on Oprah.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.906
People who cannot handle
conflict, so right

16:13.940 --> 16:16.743
away they run for the alcohol.

16:16.776 --> 16:19.479
Well, have another shot
of pancake, Roseanne.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.554
You know, people who
live in glass houses

16:27.587 --> 16:28.588
shouldn't eat stones.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.494
Well, we're not
talking about me.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.629
I am, I am talking about you.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.266
Just once, one
time, I would like

16:39.299 --> 16:46.639
for you to be for me, to be
on my side, for me alone,

16:46.673 --> 16:48.775
so it doesn't have
anything to do with you.

16:48.808 --> 16:52.212
Yeah, well, maybe I won't
do that, Jackie, if you ever

16:52.245 --> 16:53.713
came up with some
kind of an idea

16:53.746 --> 16:55.615
that I could actually support.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.318
What is wrong with that idea?

16:58.351 --> 17:02.021
What is wrong with me
becoming a policewoman?

17:02.055 --> 17:04.757
Yes, I know, sometimes
I start on things

17:04.791 --> 17:06.726
and I never follow
through with them,

17:06.759 --> 17:10.063
and I know that sometimes I
get jazzed about stuff that's

17:10.097 --> 17:11.498
not even ever going to happen.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.400
But this is going to
happen, and I wish

17:13.433 --> 17:15.902
you would give me some support.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.670
Well, why can't
you just go and be

17:17.704 --> 17:19.072
something like a meter maid?

17:19.106 --> 17:21.208
I mean, you're used
to work at Wellman.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.244
You're used to
handling small change.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.112
See, that's it.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.179
It.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.416
Again, What do I have
to do to convince

17:29.449 --> 17:32.785
you that I could be a cop?

17:32.819 --> 17:33.720
Beat you up?

17:36.956 --> 17:40.059
Ha, yeah, not
on your best day.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.297
Oh, come on.

17:47.800 --> 17:48.735
Uh.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.503
Come on.

17:50.537 --> 17:51.871
Uh.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.872
Take your best shot.

17:56.476 --> 18:00.347
[inaudible] You
know that I would

18:00.380 --> 18:02.915
just knock your lights out.

18:02.949 --> 18:06.253
Well, then go ahead.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.554
Make my day.

18:16.028 --> 18:19.366
[screaming]

18:32.745 --> 18:36.183
Excuse me.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.486
Is this like a sex thing?

18:39.519 --> 18:41.921
Because if it is, I'll
go and get the camera,

18:41.954 --> 18:44.357
and we can toss
that magazine again.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.793
Dan, get her off of me.

18:46.826 --> 18:50.730
Don't you come near
me, I'll break her wrist.

18:50.763 --> 18:51.698
Dan!

18:51.731 --> 18:54.066
I think she
means it, Roseanne.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.168
I do mean it.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.969
She does mean it, folks.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.772
And this is the grudge match
we've all been waiting for.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.808
[inaudible] throw
out the rulebook,

19:01.841 --> 19:04.677
the [inaudible] Wrestling
Federation rules do not apply.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.045
Dan, I'm serious.

19:06.078 --> 19:07.780
She's serious, folks.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.749
I'm really serious!

19:09.782 --> 19:11.718
She's really serious!

19:11.751 --> 19:15.355
You apologize to me for
never being on my side.

19:15.388 --> 19:18.291
I do not have nothing
to apologize for!

19:18.325 --> 19:19.759
Ah!

19:19.792 --> 19:22.128
Uh, this is not
for the squeamish.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.197
I think that wrist
it about to go.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.097
No!

19:25.131 --> 19:27.734
Come on, Roseanne.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.636
OK, I'm sorry.

19:29.669 --> 19:30.570
Louder.

19:30.603 --> 19:34.607
[sobbing] No,
this is ridiculous.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.508
Ah!

19:35.542 --> 19:37.977
I said I'm sorry.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.346
You say it like you mean it.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.813
I mean it, I'm sorry.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.849
And it's an
apology to the head.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.284
Dan, get out of here.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.185
Get the hell out of here!

19:46.219 --> 19:48.087
I'm out of here!

19:48.120 --> 19:51.023
OK, why are you sorry?

19:51.057 --> 19:54.026
No, you let me sit up,
and I'll tell you why.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.463
[whining]

20:09.542 --> 20:11.978
OK, you want to be a cop?

20:12.011 --> 20:13.380
Fine.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.014
I will support you.

20:15.047 --> 20:19.051
But I Just make one
point before I do.

20:22.855 --> 20:26.593
OK, pig, I've got a gun and I'm
going to blow your head off.

20:26.626 --> 20:29.396
What are you going
to do about it?

20:29.429 --> 20:30.697
Slap your hand away.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.099
Go ahead.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.435
Bang!

20:35.468 --> 20:36.269
You're dead, Jackie!

20:40.307 --> 20:42.675
You're dead.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.510
Get it?

21:03.162 --> 21:04.096
Meter maid is good.

21:06.733 --> 21:11.170
You get a little uniform, drive
a nice car, get some benefits,

21:11.203 --> 21:12.339
take home some money.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.840
Meter Maid is not bad.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.475
That's a good idea, sis.

21:15.508 --> 21:17.710
Yeah, and then you'll
give some guy a ticket,

21:17.744 --> 21:21.147
and he'll get out his car,
and I'll blow your head off.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.182
Oh, so now you don't
want me to be a meter maid?

21:23.215 --> 21:24.083
No, I've been--

21:24.116 --> 21:25.518
[music playing]

21:28.921 --> 21:30.623
[suspenseful music]

21:39.131 --> 21:40.232
[sigh]

21:41.534 --> 21:44.471
[music playing]
