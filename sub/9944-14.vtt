WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:05.572
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:07.140 --> 01:08.459
CHUCKLES

01:08.540 --> 01:12.169
Scatter! Party!

01:15.660 --> 01:19.619
(Liam) 'Affairs of the heart
are troublesome to adults.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.378
'They're complex,
and carry lots of baggage.

01:23.460 --> 01:26.179
'And consequences. Big and small.'

01:26.260 --> 01:29.377
Will you fuckin' lie at peace?

01:29.460 --> 01:34.011
'It's the one area of life where adults
get to behave irrationally.

01:34.100 --> 01:35.897
'Like kids on a sugar rush,

01:35.980 --> 01:39.575
'tears and tantrums,
falling out and not speakin'.

01:39.660 --> 01:41.412
'Secrets and lies.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.170
'Makes you wonder whether it's worth it,

01:45.260 --> 01:48.491
'if it wouldn't it be better
to stay on your own?

01:48.580 --> 01:51.617
'Be a priest,
or a Trappist monk or somethin'?

01:51.700 --> 01:54.260
'Live apart from society?

01:56.340 --> 02:00.299
'lf only there was a superior being
I could believe in.'

02:05.940 --> 02:06.895
Where's Liam?

02:08.139 --> 02:10.973
He's gonna be late. Liam!

02:11.060 --> 02:13.494
Oh, don't get up, I'll fix his toast(!)

02:13.580 --> 02:15.935
Hello! Have you seen the size of me?

02:16.020 --> 02:17.214
FOOTSTEPS

02:17.300 --> 02:19.211
- You didn't wake me!
- Got a study day.

02:20.660 --> 02:23.049
MONICA LAUGHS

02:23.140 --> 02:27.019
God, he looks like
a refugee from the 1980s!

02:27.100 --> 02:29.170
There's nothing wrong with him.

02:29.260 --> 02:32.093
Well, the fashion police
might beg to differ, Debbie!

02:32.180 --> 02:33.533
Why's she laughin'?

02:33.620 --> 02:37.374
Cos her hormones have affected
her brain. Go and get your bag.

02:39.020 --> 02:42.569
Scar him for life, sending him
into school with trousers like that!

02:42.660 --> 02:45.254
They're gonna have to do him
till the end of term,

02:45.340 --> 02:47.490
unless you have a contribution to make.

02:47.580 --> 02:51.459
Oh, I forgot, he's my job,
just like everything else round here.

02:51.540 --> 02:54.293
Developing a victim complex,
are we, Debbie?

02:54.380 --> 02:55.608
I'm knackered.

02:55.700 --> 02:59.056
Try sleeping next to the heffalump over there.
Then see how knackered you are.

02:59.140 --> 03:01.051
I'm cookin' a baby.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.859
Which forces you to kick the fuck
out of me in me sleep?!

03:03.940 --> 03:05.259
Wake me up for dinner.

03:05.340 --> 03:08.457
Christ, more meat on a butcher's pencil, Carl.

03:08.540 --> 03:09.609
I've got no clean shirts.

03:09.700 --> 03:12.453
Come on, Debs,
I'm seeing Tracey Kelvin later.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.054
We've got two possibilities, then,
haven't we?

03:15.140 --> 03:17.449
Either I've washed, dried and ironed them

03:17.540 --> 03:19.496
and hid 'em somewhere
so you can't find them,

03:19.580 --> 03:23.334
or alternatively, since you should be
able to get off your arse

03:23.420 --> 03:27.333
and wash your own shirts by now,
it's still in the washing basket.

03:27.420 --> 03:29.331
Which do you think it is?

03:29.420 --> 03:33.493
Well, if you didn't stay up
half the night texting your mates,

03:33.580 --> 03:35.616
you might not be so tetchy of a morning!

03:36.660 --> 03:38.332
So did she wash the shirts or not?

03:40.000 --> 03:46.074

03:51.020 --> 03:52.419
(Mimi) Jocks, I hate them.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.651
How come the filth are all over us
like a rash? What have we done?

03:55.740 --> 03:57.890
Fuck all! Somebody's
feeding them information.

03:57.980 --> 04:00.335
(Mimi) Shortbread, what's that about?

04:00.420 --> 04:03.412
Biggest score in six fucking months,

04:03.500 --> 04:06.458
and we couldn't shift a vitamin C tablet
if there was a plague of rickets.

04:06.540 --> 04:09.054
You reckon it's them Jocks
that have been sellin' 'em round pubs?

04:09.140 --> 04:12.974
I know it's those tight-fisted, skirt-wearing,

04:13.060 --> 04:15.335
Braveheart-watching Scottish fuckers!

04:15.420 --> 04:18.378
Anonymous phone tips
to Inspector Plod. Hm!

04:19.459 --> 04:21.576
They've no morals up there.

04:21.660 --> 04:24.458
That's why we kicked them
out of Ireland in the sixth century.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.417
Not like they've got a sell-by-date.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.649
Pills.

04:27.740 --> 04:31.096
All of our petty cash is tied up
in those pills, you skidmark.

04:31.180 --> 04:36.573
- We are stony fucking broke!
- (Mimi) Braveheart, me arse!

04:36.660 --> 04:41.256
Your mother's in there, cooking,
like it's going out of fashion!

04:41.340 --> 04:44.491
...useless fuckin', grassin',
haggis-eating Scottish...

04:44.580 --> 04:49.096
It wouldn't be a plague of rickets.
It'd be a plague of crickets.

04:49.180 --> 04:53.810
Like that bloke Jimmy out of Pinocchio.
One with the top hat.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.572
Pigs have just nicked our Mandy.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.332
- She's got Katie with her.
- What for?

04:57.420 --> 04:59.138
Haven't got a clue. Two minutes ago.

04:59.220 --> 05:01.211
Mam, the cops have nicked our Mandy.

05:01.300 --> 05:05.657
- (AII plead) Mickey! No!
- <i>Bastards!</i>

05:09.180 --> 05:10.295
It burns.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.771
I think that's upside down.

05:18.340 --> 05:19.295
What the fuck?

05:19.380 --> 05:20.608
- Anything?
- You?

05:21.860 --> 05:24.055
Didn't stop her shining
a torch up me crack.

05:24.140 --> 05:26.495
Believe me, some sights
are better left unseen.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.138
(Tom) Oh, that's gross!

05:28.220 --> 05:29.699
(Carrie) Uh! Rank!

05:29.780 --> 05:31.099
(Tom) Hasn't she got a nappy on?

05:31.180 --> 05:34.331
- CSI Chatsworth here wanted to inspect it.
- Another feast for the eyes.

05:34.420 --> 05:37.173
- Well, you should get one on her before...
- I haven't got a spare.

05:37.260 --> 05:38.613
I was only popping down the shop.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.418
We'll give you a hand putting it...

05:40.500 --> 05:42.491
Don't bother. Quicker if I do it myself.

05:42.580 --> 05:45.140
Stay there, Katie. Good girl.

05:49.180 --> 05:53.332
I'm sorry about this.
We got a tip-off.

05:53.420 --> 05:57.015
Get better information, then.
It's fuckin' harassment. She's soaked.

06:01.700 --> 06:02.894
Oi, you dropped...

06:08.620 --> 06:09.655
DOOR OPENS

06:13.380 --> 06:16.053
Oh, me baby! How is he?

06:17.300 --> 06:18.289
Arrgh!

06:18.380 --> 06:22.612
Eh, not even third-degree burns.
I've had worse off Swan Vestas.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.009
Gotta keep this cream on,
stop it blisterin'.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.738
- Because he's worth it.
- Shut it, you!

06:26.820 --> 06:30.051
Have some consideration, Shane.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.700
Wasn't me that threw a pan
of pasta of sauce over him.

06:32.780 --> 06:36.250
And what's that supposed to mean?
You calling me a bad mother?

06:36.340 --> 06:37.455
Mimi.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.656
"Mimi"! What?

06:39.740 --> 06:41.332
He was havin' a go, weren't ya?

06:42.300 --> 06:43.415
Wasn't he?!

06:54.140 --> 06:57.132
- (Mandy) God's sake. Fuckin' coppers.
- Don't let them get to you.

06:57.220 --> 06:59.575
Sitting there all morning.
She gets a rash,

06:59.660 --> 07:01.491
- I'm makin' a complaint.
- All right!

07:01.580 --> 07:04.811
- I'm on your side, remember?
- I know.

07:04.900 --> 07:06.299
Sorry.

07:21.660 --> 07:22.934
Oh, shit.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.411
Is this what you're lookin' for?

07:29.500 --> 07:32.697
You must have dropped it on the floor
when you stripped the buggy.

07:32.780 --> 07:34.930
This is a private letter.

07:35.020 --> 07:37.659
I didn't know it was important.

07:37.740 --> 07:41.176
You lot searched me daughter
and stuck fingers up my arse.

07:41.260 --> 07:45.219
Think I was gonna run after you
and deliver your mail?

07:46.820 --> 07:47.775
I'm sorry.

08:00.740 --> 08:01.809
You all right?

08:03.820 --> 08:06.254
SOBBING

08:08.300 --> 08:10.211
She were only your birth mother.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.939
Your real mum's the one
who brought you up.

08:13.020 --> 08:15.329
I was brought up in a care home,
there is no real mum.

08:15.420 --> 08:18.059
- She was it.
- You've been looking for her a long time?

08:18.140 --> 08:21.018
Two years.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.289
I was gonna start earlier,
but everyone said,

08:25.380 --> 08:27.735
"Wait till you're older,
till you know your own mind."

08:27.820 --> 08:30.618
Now, she's fuckin' dead!

08:32.220 --> 08:33.698
You're not gonna give up?

08:33.780 --> 08:37.375
Her children,
they're your brothers and sisters.

08:37.460 --> 08:38.734
Half.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.732
Half-brothers and one sister.

08:42.820 --> 08:46.972
Now apparently, I'm an "unfortunate
mistake from my mother's youth,

08:47.060 --> 08:50.939
"and shouldn't tarnish her good name
by forcing myself upon the family."

08:51.020 --> 08:53.773
They've had a shock.
Mother's not six weeks dead,

08:53.860 --> 08:55.418
and a son crawls out of the woodwork.

08:55.500 --> 08:58.298
You could be a gold-digger,
for all they know.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.574
Thanks a bunch.

09:02.820 --> 09:04.776
I'd better get back inside.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.575
You can't go in like that.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.696
Your eyes are all puffy.

09:10.780 --> 09:13.214
Here.

09:17.660 --> 09:19.651
How old was she when she had you?

09:19.740 --> 09:24.018
17. Good Catholic family,
sent her off to Ireland to have the baby,

09:24.100 --> 09:27.217
get it adopted, spare the family shame.

09:27.300 --> 09:31.054
Did you know she was from the north-west?
Is that why you came over?

09:31.140 --> 09:33.529
Hadn't a clue.

09:33.620 --> 09:36.453
Believe me, it's a shock to think you're Irish,

09:36.540 --> 09:39.259
then find out it's English blood in your veins.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.808
Chip on my shoulder's totally confused!

09:43.580 --> 09:45.411
I just don't get it.

09:45.500 --> 09:49.129
I mean, you're a mother.
How could you give away your own baby?

09:50.340 --> 09:53.776
That's a bit of a bloke's attitude,
if you don't mind me sayin'.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.897
I was 15 when I fell pregnant with Katie.

09:56.980 --> 09:58.811
Hardest thing I've ever done.

09:58.900 --> 10:02.973
People say they'll support you,
but they don't really.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.779
Nappy-changing and buying vests, yeah.

10:05.860 --> 10:09.773
But in the important stuff, in the dark hours,
when you think you're the worst mum ever,

10:09.860 --> 10:12.693
you resent her cos she's changed everything,

10:12.780 --> 10:16.011
forced you to be old before your time,
there's moments

10:16.100 --> 10:18.330
you'd flog her on eBay
for the price of a bottle of cider.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.371
So do you wish you hadn't had her?

10:21.460 --> 10:24.372
Are you mental?

10:24.460 --> 10:27.657
She's the most beautiful thing
that's ever happened to me.

10:27.740 --> 10:30.129
The only beautiful thing
that's ever happened to me.

10:34.540 --> 10:37.008
How could I do that to me own baby?

10:38.620 --> 10:41.930
You lost your temper,
everybody does sometimes.

10:43.740 --> 10:44.968
It's like the deed's done

10:45.060 --> 10:46.379
before me brain's had time

10:46.460 --> 10:48.098
to process the thought.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.135
Bothers me.

10:49.220 --> 10:51.688
Then let's do something about it.

10:53.900 --> 10:57.415
Nobody's allowed to bother my angel.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.570
Not... even... you.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.375
Done.

11:07.580 --> 11:11.334
Listen, thanks for taking the time.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.217
Had a gap in my schedule.

11:13.300 --> 11:18.499
Besides, your eyes don't look like you've gone
12 rounds with Ricky Hatton now.

11:18.580 --> 11:20.696
I'm really sorry I opened your letter.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.452
Yeah, yeah.

11:22.540 --> 11:25.373
Funny, but... well, I'm not.

11:28.620 --> 11:29.848
I'll see you.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.419
(lan) A copper?!

11:35.500 --> 11:40.096
Shh. I felt sorry for him.
Seems like a nice bloke.

11:40.180 --> 11:43.252
- What is it with you and men in uniform?
- Shut up!

11:45.820 --> 11:47.378
You gonna ask him out?

11:47.460 --> 11:49.416
No...

11:49.500 --> 11:51.138
How would that look, anyway?

11:51.220 --> 11:53.859
A Maguire and a police officer
off down the pictures?

11:53.940 --> 11:55.259
You're finding excuses.

11:55.340 --> 12:00.016
I feel as if me radar's broke...
after Lip, and then Dex.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.579
I don't know what to think.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.656
I don't wanna make an arse of meself.

12:04.740 --> 12:06.492
Test the water, then.

12:06.580 --> 12:07.808
How?

12:07.900 --> 12:11.859
Well, you've got the world's best buffer
in there. Take her with.

12:14.140 --> 12:17.052
- Can't find me trou...!
- Here.

12:17.140 --> 12:19.131
Try them.

12:21.580 --> 12:24.458
They look worse.
You can see the turn-up a mile off!

12:24.540 --> 12:26.132
Well, I'll iron them, then.

12:26.220 --> 12:30.452
- Why can't I wear them like they were before?
- Because you can't, that's all.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.813
There we go.

12:37.940 --> 12:39.373
Are we poor?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.092
What made you ask that?

12:42.180 --> 12:44.136
Nothin'.

12:44.220 --> 12:47.735
Just... Some of the kids at school said.

12:47.820 --> 12:52.018
We do all right. We're not any poorer
than anyone else,

12:52.100 --> 12:55.615
and it doesn't matter
what other people say, OK?

12:55.700 --> 12:56.689
I know.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.898
Come on, Tracey! It's just a date!

13:03.020 --> 13:04.612
All right, Carl?

13:13.340 --> 13:15.570
Here he comes - the great unwashed!

13:17.700 --> 13:19.179
I need...

13:20.780 --> 13:22.452
I need... advice.

13:22.540 --> 13:24.371
It's about...

13:24.460 --> 13:25.609
sex.

13:29.780 --> 13:32.419
Right, I'm seeing this girl, Tracey Kelvin,

13:32.500 --> 13:36.129
- and she's dead experienced.
- You've popped your cherry, though?

13:36.220 --> 13:37.699
Course I have, but...

13:37.780 --> 13:39.293
she knows stuff.

13:39.380 --> 13:42.178
Loads of stuff.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.216
You've had older women.
Didn't they teach you?

13:44.300 --> 13:46.256
Yeah, but they always did stuff to me.

13:46.340 --> 13:48.376
Tracey expects me to do stuff to her.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.613
So you want me to teach you foreplay?

13:54.700 --> 13:56.338
What's that?

14:00.940 --> 14:03.374
(Man) 'I was so angry, I went
out to the garage and snapped... '

14:03.460 --> 14:05.928
(Woman) '... Every time I drink.
I've run out of excuses... '

14:06.020 --> 14:07.976
- (Man) '... A slag, to her face.
My P45 arrived... '

14:08.060 --> 14:11.575
(Man) '... Full volume, day and night.
I threw his stereo out the window... '

14:11.660 --> 14:14.049
< Mimi?

14:15.180 --> 14:16.932
Do you have anything to share?

14:24.020 --> 14:27.535
Well, there was the time
I hit my husband with me shoe -

14:27.620 --> 14:29.372
a good six-inch heel.

14:31.340 --> 14:35.219
He'd come in seven sheets to the wind
every night that week,

14:35.300 --> 14:37.018
and the kids were only small.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.335
I kept them on deliberate.

14:42.420 --> 14:45.093
Stilettos, like...

14:45.180 --> 14:48.490
So I took a knife and carved
me initials into his back,

14:48.580 --> 14:51.697
ten inches high,
while he was still tied up.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.738
Next time one of my lads
hit a ball into his garden,

14:54.820 --> 14:58.859
he handed it back double-quick,
that's for sure.

15:03.860 --> 15:05.657
If you try taking a deep breath before you act...

15:05.740 --> 15:08.812
Brian, I've tried everything.

15:08.900 --> 15:11.414
I've tried counting to ten,
I've tried saying a prayer

15:11.500 --> 15:13.013
to St Clare of Assisi.

15:13.100 --> 15:17.332
I never get past three, and I always
end up going to confession after.

15:17.420 --> 15:19.297
There are other strategies.

15:19.380 --> 15:21.132
Problem-solving,

15:21.220 --> 15:24.257
better communication,
cognitive restructuring.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.568
I'm not a hippy!

15:25.660 --> 15:31.371
I'm talking about empathising with people,
putting yourself in their shoes.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.735
I'll give you some materials that might help.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.818
Haven't you got immigrant labour
who do that for you?

15:42.900 --> 15:44.856
Filling my day with meaningless tasks!

15:44.940 --> 15:47.818
- Where you off to?
- Just out for a walk.

15:49.300 --> 15:50.699
So have you phoned them?

15:51.940 --> 15:53.168
I don't see the point.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.658
Well, see you, then.

15:58.740 --> 15:59.855
Hey, wait!

15:59.940 --> 16:02.329
I'm due a break.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.138
Do you want to go to the park?

16:05.900 --> 16:07.299
I'll spring for the ice-cream.

16:09.820 --> 16:11.253
All right.

16:13.860 --> 16:16.932
If you could have asked your mother
one question, what would it be?

16:17.020 --> 16:18.976
I couldn't ask her just one question.

16:19.060 --> 16:20.812
It would have to be a million, or none.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.333
Like what?

16:22.420 --> 16:26.015
Like... is there a history of
heart attacks in the family?

16:26.100 --> 16:29.615
Did she get the life she wanted
after she gave me up?

16:29.700 --> 16:31.099
Where did I get this nose?

16:31.180 --> 16:33.535
You could probably sue for the nose!

16:33.620 --> 16:35.770
It's just cruel to lumber a kid with that!

16:35.860 --> 16:37.816
LAUGHS

16:41.260 --> 16:42.579
You've got to call them.

16:44.980 --> 16:46.015
I don't think so.

16:48.260 --> 16:50.615
Another lesson you learn in care -

16:50.700 --> 16:52.691
you can't make people accept you.

16:52.780 --> 16:54.418
(Both) Wheee!

16:58.060 --> 16:59.539
What's for tea, Mum?

16:59.620 --> 17:01.292
Home-made stew.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.535
There's nowt here.

17:06.619 --> 17:08.895
That's because you haven't made it yet.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.252
(Carl) OK, what's my first lesson?

17:21.339 --> 17:23.296
So what d'you normally do?

17:23.380 --> 17:26.611
Shag 'em for as long as I can before...

17:28.540 --> 17:29.973
Before, you know?

17:31.340 --> 17:32.693
And that's it?

17:32.780 --> 17:35.692
No, I give them a bit of a rub first.

17:35.780 --> 17:39.011
I went six minutes, once - 324 pumps.

17:40.620 --> 17:43.259
You don't, like...

17:43.340 --> 17:44.568
build up to it, like,

17:44.660 --> 17:47.618
- with her erogenous zones?
- Tits and fanny, yeah.

17:50.820 --> 17:53.015
This Tracey Kelvin better be worth it!

17:56.340 --> 17:57.693
SHOUTING AND CLATTERING

17:57.780 --> 18:00.738
(Mickey) Get off me, ya bastard!
Get off me!

18:15.460 --> 18:16.859
In!

18:21.180 --> 18:22.579
Nobody died.

18:22.660 --> 18:26.289
It would be irrational to get
overly upset about a ruined dinner.

18:26.380 --> 18:29.531
This is cognitive restructuring.

18:29.620 --> 18:34.410
We could attempt to problem-solve
the reasons why you two felt it necessary

18:34.500 --> 18:36.650
to batter the living shite out of one another.

18:36.740 --> 18:43.213
What I think's required here
is some positive reinforcement.

18:43.300 --> 18:47.179
So...
Shane, tell your brother that you love him.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.216
Fuck off!

18:49.300 --> 18:52.178
Tell your brother you love him.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.813
MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY

19:06.260 --> 19:11.778
You're not trying to poke a hole in a fence.
Like you're licking a Bartletts pear half.

19:11.860 --> 19:14.533
MUMBLES

19:14.620 --> 19:15.575
What?

19:15.660 --> 19:18.618
I said, how long have I gotta do it for?
My tongue's knackered.

19:19.740 --> 19:21.651
A bit, like, softer.

19:21.740 --> 19:24.129
(Man) I'm dying of thirst, here!

19:24.220 --> 19:27.610
- I wish I could help him, that's all.
- So help him.

19:27.700 --> 19:30.168
Do something about it,
get on his good side.

19:30.260 --> 19:33.218
I can't, it's personal stuff.
I hardly even know him.

19:33.300 --> 19:35.894
Yeah, all right. Talk yourself out of it.

19:35.980 --> 19:39.256
God forbid you should meet a bloke
with a good job who's keen on you!

19:39.340 --> 19:40.898
I don't know that he's keen on me.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.336
Yeah, fair point. Cops are always
taking me to the park for ice lollies!

19:46.380 --> 19:48.610
Pint and two Es, Karen.

19:48.700 --> 19:52.090
You look like a chicken who's just
been told she's got to shit an egg!

19:52.180 --> 19:54.774
Here, you're a mother...

19:54.860 --> 19:56.213
No, I'm not.

19:56.300 --> 19:59.497
Well, yeah. Well, you know, you've got
all the raw materials, haven't you?

19:59.580 --> 20:04.017
Do you have a?
Is there a nesting instinct in you,

20:04.100 --> 20:07.012
makes you wanna kick
everyone else out of the homestead,

20:07.100 --> 20:10.297
- make room for your chicks?
- Oh, has Monica got the sweats?

20:10.380 --> 20:14.532
Oh, "the sweats"? The sweats?!
Is that what you call it?

20:14.620 --> 20:17.214
Grievous bodily harm
in anyone else's language.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.973
- Well, you know what the answer is.
- What's that?

20:20.060 --> 20:22.051
Keep your pecker in your pants.

20:23.420 --> 20:28.892
...So I said to Bill Roache - Ken Barlow,
of course - I said, "Billy!

20:28.980 --> 20:31.892
"You want to know
what side your bread's buttered!

20:31.980 --> 20:34.733
"Tie them into a long-term contract."

20:34.820 --> 20:38.859
I said, "So what if you're typecast,
you'll have a steady income.

20:38.940 --> 20:41.215
"Not many can say that."

20:41.300 --> 20:43.256
- I'm knackered, mate.
- If there was a book entitled,

20:43.340 --> 20:45.137
All Men Know About Women, it'd be empty.

20:45.220 --> 20:48.530
She's gone completely off at deep end.
She's made us hug each other.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.973
Yeah, like we was poofs!

20:50.060 --> 20:52.210
I can see you getting in touch
with your feminine side!

20:52.300 --> 20:56.009
Your mother has depths you've never
been exposed to. Give her credit.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.568
- But, Dad...
- I said, give her credit!

21:00.300 --> 21:05.533
- Trust me, she'll be able to help you out.
- Belle Carter? Are you having a laugh?

21:05.620 --> 21:08.612
She was an extra on Corrie
for about ten minutes 30 years ago.

21:08.700 --> 21:12.215
You'd think she was... fucking Hamlet
at the Royal Shakespeare!

21:12.300 --> 21:14.052
Get a better idea, have you?

21:14.140 --> 21:15.095
Have you?

21:15.180 --> 21:18.616
You said you wanted to help him,
and now's your chance.

21:22.220 --> 21:24.893
Go on, she's waitin'.

21:24.980 --> 21:26.299
Go on!

21:26.380 --> 21:27.733
All right.

21:33.740 --> 21:36.618
All right, Belle? Drinks are on me.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.339
Ooh!

21:39.420 --> 21:42.173
That's very kind of you.

21:42.260 --> 21:45.570
D'you know, you remind me a little
of Pat Phoenix -

21:45.660 --> 21:49.699
Elsie Tanner, God rest her soul.
Course, she was a redhead.

21:49.780 --> 21:52.738
"Never call me ginger,"
she once said to me.

21:54.740 --> 21:57.652
Look, I've got a job for you.

21:57.740 --> 21:59.298
I want you to pretend to be someone.

21:59.380 --> 22:01.610
I'm trying to help a friend.

22:05.540 --> 22:06.859
Righty-ho.

22:06.940 --> 22:10.694
You get the drinks in,
and tell Belle all about the role.

22:10.780 --> 22:13.692
Oh, and gin, if you don't mind, this time.

22:13.780 --> 22:15.179
Protein power diet.

22:16.700 --> 22:18.895
Right.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.455
SNIFFS

22:25.540 --> 22:29.533
- What the fuck's that smell?
- Lavender. It's soothin'.

22:31.300 --> 22:32.938
Smells like the inside of a hooker's oxter.

22:36.140 --> 22:37.971
You said you'd support me, Paddy.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.528
I'm trying to mellow.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.259
I... will, sweet pea,

22:43.340 --> 22:45.171
of course I'll support you.

22:45.260 --> 22:48.616
Good. I really think it's workin'.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.976
I've got some potpourri
drying in the kitchen.

22:59.260 --> 23:00.215
Water?!

23:01.380 --> 23:02.779
Hey.

23:02.860 --> 23:05.294
Yeah. X-Factor!

23:08.820 --> 23:12.654
She says she's going home
to get inside the skin of the character.

23:12.740 --> 23:14.970
What, like Silence Of The Lambs?

23:15.060 --> 23:17.494
I wouldn't put it past her.
She's loopy enough.

23:17.580 --> 23:19.696
I'm meeting her tomorrow to give details.

23:19.780 --> 23:22.214
All this to get inside some bizzy's boxers!

23:22.300 --> 23:24.575
- Like that's gonna happen!
- You never know.

23:24.660 --> 23:26.093
(Man) Pint, please, lan.

23:26.180 --> 23:27.169
Yeah, mate.

23:43.260 --> 23:46.616
So I won't give you the full bag,
I'll give you a quarter.

23:46.700 --> 23:50.375
Keep your head clear. See if you can
patch it up with that nice girl of yours.

23:50.460 --> 23:51.654
Ta-ra.

23:55.660 --> 23:57.218
What was all that about?

23:57.300 --> 24:01.930
Young Felix is on the baccy morning,
noon and night. It's ruining his relationship.

24:02.020 --> 24:04.659
A bit less smoking would do them both
the world of good.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.695
Oh!

24:12.020 --> 24:13.419
Dad, what are you doing?

24:13.500 --> 24:14.933
Oh...

24:15.020 --> 24:17.454
Why does everybody in this house

24:17.540 --> 24:21.533
see it as their duty
to physically abuse me?

24:21.620 --> 24:24.612
Listen, Dad, I'm worried about Liam.

24:24.700 --> 24:27.772
He thinks we're poor,
and he's getting teased.

24:27.860 --> 24:30.977
I am the one bearing the brunt, Deb.

24:31.060 --> 24:35.258
I mean, nobody thinks about fathers,
do they? We're just supposed

24:35.340 --> 24:40.016
to keep shtoom and just get on with it,
like Gary Cooper in High Noon.

24:40.100 --> 24:44.173
What about me, Deb? What about me?

24:44.260 --> 24:45.932
Hello, love.

24:47.540 --> 24:48.859
Look...

24:48.940 --> 24:52.774
I think I made a mistake.
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

24:54.340 --> 24:56.456
It's nothing personal, it's just...

24:56.540 --> 25:01.409
pretending to be best mates with some dead
woman you've never met is too much of an ask.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.728
Oh!

25:02.820 --> 25:06.290
You'd have loved Patricia
if you'd met her - everybody did.

25:06.380 --> 25:11.135
- What?
- It broke her heart giving that baby away.

25:11.220 --> 25:13.973
But it was different days.
Her parents were religious.

25:14.060 --> 25:17.496
You did what your father said
or you were out.

25:17.580 --> 25:20.890
Ne'er a day went by
when she didn't slink off for a quiet cry

25:20.980 --> 25:24.575
about her lad growing up in Ireland,
nobody belonging to him.

25:24.660 --> 25:27.174
Not that she looked for sympathy.

25:27.260 --> 25:30.570
No, there was just a sadness there,

25:30.660 --> 25:34.573
a guilt, you could say,
that she never quite shook off.

25:44.940 --> 25:48.569
This is everything I can remember
from the letter and stuff he said.

25:48.660 --> 25:49.979
Right-oh.

25:50.060 --> 25:54.850
Oh, um... cider and black,
if you don't mind, love. I skipped breakfast.

26:00.780 --> 26:01.735
So?

26:03.620 --> 26:05.656
She was... fucking brilliant.

26:05.740 --> 26:08.095
- Nearly believed her myself.
- What did I tell you?

26:08.180 --> 26:12.492
Pint of lager and two Es,
and don't spare the horses.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.292
MOBILE RINGS

26:18.380 --> 26:19.779
Hello?

26:19.860 --> 26:23.011
Yeah, I can be there at 7.30.

26:23.100 --> 26:25.978
I've just got an errand to run.

26:26.060 --> 26:27.971
Everything all right?

26:28.060 --> 26:30.858
OK, see you then.

26:33.100 --> 26:35.056
< It wasn't my fault.

26:35.140 --> 26:36.368
WHIMPERS

26:37.660 --> 26:40.572
Since when do we invite junkies
into our house for tea?

26:40.660 --> 26:45.780
The lad's father ridiculed him
all through his teens because of his acne.

26:45.860 --> 26:48.420
I'm empathising, Patrick.

26:48.500 --> 26:52.652
Be with you in a minute, girls.
Terry's almost done.

26:52.740 --> 26:55.413
Are any of these spongers
actually buying anything?

26:55.500 --> 26:57.695
There's more to life
than money, Patrick.

26:57.780 --> 27:00.089
You have to nurture the soul.

27:00.180 --> 27:02.648
The drugs are bad enough.
But now my own wife

27:02.740 --> 27:05.049
is trying to drive me
into bankruptcy!

27:05.140 --> 27:06.937
I'll be back in a minute, love.

27:07.020 --> 27:09.534
Keep projecting positive thoughts.

27:09.620 --> 27:11.053
OK.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.132
Why are you being so hostile?

27:19.500 --> 27:21.730
Business is going down the shitter

27:21.820 --> 27:26.371
and you're turning our most reliable punters
into a bunch of fucking tree huggers!

27:26.460 --> 27:29.179
I'm doling out help and advice
alongside the gear.

27:29.260 --> 27:31.455
It's responsible selling.

27:31.540 --> 27:33.053
It's irresponsible, Mimi!

27:33.140 --> 27:36.416
It takes you a fucking hour
to shift a couple of pills!

27:38.180 --> 27:41.650
I'm a new woman.
I thought it's what everyone wanted.

27:41.740 --> 27:45.255
If you don't like it,
then maybe <i>we've</i> got a problem.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.250
(Terry) It wasn't my fault.

27:50.340 --> 27:52.729
(Mimi) I'm with you now. OK?

27:53.780 --> 27:55.293
< It wasn't my fault.

27:55.380 --> 27:57.052
It's all right. Deep breaths...

28:15.780 --> 28:17.532
Come on, Frank, you've had enough.

28:17.620 --> 28:20.612
He's only had two pints all afternoon.
He's just sleeping.

28:20.700 --> 28:24.978
Don't get me wrong, I don't want a new fucking
woman, I want the woman I married back.

28:25.060 --> 28:27.858
Some junkie was helping her
move furniture when I left.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.738
Something about
energy flow and feng chewie.

28:30.820 --> 28:33.732
- She's lost the fucking plot.
- Don't talk about your mother like that.

28:33.820 --> 28:36.334
- You just said...
- That's different, I'm her husband.

28:36.420 --> 28:41.096
You're meant to worship her while she's here
and canonise her once she's passed away.

28:41.180 --> 28:42.693
That's how it works in Irish families.

28:42.780 --> 28:46.773
I don't care how many herbal soaps she puts in
the bathroom - my Mimi is in there somewhere.

28:46.860 --> 28:52.412
We have to find a way to provoke a response
that'll snap her out of this before it goes too far.

28:54.020 --> 28:55.692
You look great.

28:55.780 --> 28:59.170
Thank you, love. I'll pretend
I didn't notice the tone of surprise.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.370
So, where is the boy wonder?

29:02.460 --> 29:04.257
You said he'd be here at 7.30.

29:04.340 --> 29:07.138
He promised.
Something must have come up.

29:07.220 --> 29:10.132
Right, well, I'm going
to powder my nose.

29:10.220 --> 29:13.769
- Do I have to stick strictly to the script?
- Yeah.

29:14.860 --> 29:17.294
G&T when you can, love.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.529
Oh!

29:18.620 --> 29:20.531
Christ! How long have I been here?

29:20.620 --> 29:22.292
Six hours.

29:22.380 --> 29:25.497
- How many pints have I had?
- That's just your second.

29:25.580 --> 29:27.491
Oh, right, that's fucking it!

29:27.580 --> 29:31.368
She's on the sofa tonight,
baby or no baby.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.858
Who says we're poor?

29:37.940 --> 29:41.216
- She bought them out of her own savings. >
- I don't want new trousers!

29:41.300 --> 29:43.575
Don't worry, they weren't expensive.

29:45.500 --> 29:49.971
They probably came from a sweat shop in Asia,
10p a week, no toilet breaks until October.

29:50.060 --> 29:53.655
- Oi! Don't be so ungrateful!
- Sorry, Debs. Thanks.

29:53.740 --> 29:56.891
It's OK, you don't need to thank me.
Right, I've got to go.

29:56.980 --> 29:58.732
Off out again? >

30:03.460 --> 30:05.371
I could cut my toenails in her bed.

30:05.460 --> 30:07.769
She hates it when I do that.

30:07.860 --> 30:11.899
Why the fuck would you be in my bed?

30:11.980 --> 30:14.175
I could do an oil change
in the living room.

30:14.260 --> 30:18.458
She'd turn it into Zen And The Art
Of Motorcycle Fucking Cuddliness,

30:18.540 --> 30:20.690
put an incense stick
in the oil and burn it.

30:20.780 --> 30:24.375
You could wash her whites
with her coloureds... Ruin all her undies.

30:24.460 --> 30:28.692
I could hardly tell you where the washing
machine is, let alone how to work it.

30:28.780 --> 30:31.340
Karen doesn't make you do the laundry,
does she?

30:31.420 --> 30:33.729
Well, what's important to her?

30:33.820 --> 30:38.211
She's more likely to go off her dinger
about something that matters to her, in't she?

30:39.540 --> 30:40.973
In't she? >

30:42.460 --> 30:43.734
Family.

30:43.820 --> 30:47.893
- Meaning you - her little baby.
- What?

30:47.980 --> 30:49.572
Shane,

30:49.660 --> 30:51.412
kick the shit out of your brother.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.570
< Not now!

30:53.660 --> 30:57.892
Pavlov's fucking dog! On the quiet.

30:57.980 --> 31:01.814
- Make it look like the Scots did it.
- How come he gets to do me?

31:01.900 --> 31:05.097
Unless you'd rather do it yourself.

31:05.180 --> 31:06.772
And what good's that going to do?

31:06.860 --> 31:10.011
To you, nothing, other than knowing
you're giving her pleasure.

31:10.100 --> 31:12.330
It's like an investment
for the future.

31:12.420 --> 31:18.177
Tell me again about the ari...
The bit around the nipple.

31:18.260 --> 31:21.297
I have a life, Carl.
I can't be your round-the-clock sex counsellor.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.099
I wanna learn.
And you're really helping me.

31:25.260 --> 31:26.454
It's the areola.

31:26.540 --> 31:28.417
It's all these new words.

31:28.500 --> 31:31.572
I'm never gonna remember 'em.
Unless you show me.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.252
I'm a married woman.

31:33.340 --> 31:36.776
I don't mean naked -
with your clothes on.

31:36.860 --> 31:39.738
(Paddy) The dates -
when are they coming to Manchester?

31:39.820 --> 31:42.254
The bit around here. The dark bit.

31:42.340 --> 31:44.774
You don't just want to plunge right in
onto the nipple.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.657
You wanna build up to it.

31:46.740 --> 31:49.573
I know, but... erm...

31:49.660 --> 31:51.810
Just describe
what needs to be done again.

31:51.900 --> 31:53.538
Later.

31:56.620 --> 32:00.977
Come on. Probably got a couscous salad
waiting for us, or something.

32:04.380 --> 32:05.733
I'm so sorry.

32:05.820 --> 32:07.219
We've been here two hours.

32:07.300 --> 32:09.018
I know, I'm sorry.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.056
Is this who you wanted me to meet?

32:11.140 --> 32:13.779
This is Belle.
She was a friend of your mother's.

32:13.860 --> 32:17.614
- What?
- (Slurs) We were like sisters, me and Pat.

32:17.700 --> 32:21.534
- In and out each other's houses.
- How did you?

32:21.620 --> 32:24.373
I just put the feelers out.
Big Irish family, lots of cousins.

32:24.460 --> 32:27.816
When...
How... did you know her?

32:27.900 --> 32:30.016
- I said to her only last week...
- Last year.

32:30.100 --> 32:33.854
Last year. I said, "You should trace
that boy of yours."

32:33.940 --> 32:36.898
And she did, son,
she started proceedings.

32:36.980 --> 32:40.256
Her fondest wish
to be re-nu-nited with you.

32:40.340 --> 32:43.218
She just couldn't hold on
long enough to see it through.

32:44.300 --> 32:45.699
She said this last year?

32:45.780 --> 32:47.179
Yup.

32:47.260 --> 32:49.251
- On a trip to Vegas.
- What?

32:49.340 --> 32:51.092
She'd always wanted to go there.

32:51.180 --> 32:54.570
I performed there, of course,
when I had the legs for it. >

32:54.660 --> 32:59.211
She was star-struck, your mum -
she wanted to see where Sinatra played,

32:59.300 --> 33:02.292
- Caesars Palace, MGM Grand. >
- Maybe we should stick closer to home.

33:02.380 --> 33:03.859
If you must.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.010
What exactly do you want to know, son?

33:07.260 --> 33:09.012
When did you last see my mother?

33:09.100 --> 33:12.570
Couple of months ago. At the bingo.

33:12.660 --> 33:15.732
Gambling, see.
The Vegas connection again.

33:15.820 --> 33:18.812
Hey, I tell you who liked to gamble -
Johnny Briggs.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.618
Mike Baldwin, of course.

33:20.700 --> 33:22.895
I've just come
from my mother's house.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.299
What?

33:24.380 --> 33:27.019
Really? How is she?

33:27.100 --> 33:31.252
- I met with my half-brothers and sister.
- Oh, that must have been nice.

33:32.620 --> 33:35.817
My mother was in a coma
for the last two years of her life

33:35.900 --> 33:37.572
after a brain haemorrhage.

33:37.660 --> 33:40.333
If she went to Vegas,
it must have been a hell of a trip.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.339
Who is this woman?

33:45.660 --> 33:47.013
I was trying to help.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.459
I... I'd better go.

33:54.140 --> 33:55.892
Did I get the part?

33:58.300 --> 34:00.894
Tom, wait. I'm sorry.

34:00.980 --> 34:02.618
I was trying to help.

34:02.700 --> 34:04.497
I thought if you could get some answers,

34:04.580 --> 34:07.697
even if they weren't the right ones,
it might give you some peace.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.896
It's been a long day.

34:09.980 --> 34:13.016
When I saw you crying the other day,
I couldn't bear it.

34:13.100 --> 34:14.135
Mandy...

34:15.500 --> 34:16.534
I can't.

34:18.739 --> 34:20.219
Why not?

34:20.300 --> 34:23.292
If it's because of my family,
I'm not like them.

34:23.380 --> 34:27.737
- It's just as hard for me that you're a copper.
- No, I mean I can't.

34:27.820 --> 34:31.654
I'm seeing someone.
I have been for a while.

34:32.860 --> 34:33.975
What?

34:34.060 --> 34:36.016
You never said.

34:37.139 --> 34:39.529
I didn't think it was an issue.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.771
- I didn't know you felt...
- Oh, my God!

34:42.860 --> 34:44.771
- Mandy...
- My God! My God!

34:44.860 --> 34:46.896
Mandy, I'm sorry!

34:51.179 --> 34:52.976
DISTANT SIREN WAILS

34:53.060 --> 34:55.415
I felt horrible.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.411
I didn't know what to say.

34:59.020 --> 35:02.615
If I was sending out the wrong signals,
it wasn't intentional.

35:04.460 --> 35:06.451
She was only trying to be kind.

35:08.180 --> 35:10.011
It's more than kindness.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.091
She likes you, you halfwit!

35:12.180 --> 35:14.774
I know that now.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.213
At the time...

35:20.820 --> 35:23.209
You should have talked to me
about your mum.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.530
How could I?

35:25.620 --> 35:28.259
We've got enough on our plate,
don't you think?

35:28.340 --> 35:30.854
I thought we agreed, no secrets.

35:30.940 --> 35:32.896
It wasn't a secret,
I just thought...

35:34.740 --> 35:39.256
All this sneaking around, coming here...
I can't even call you at home.

35:40.660 --> 35:43.049
Have you any idea
how patronising that sounds?

35:43.140 --> 35:44.334
Does it?

35:44.420 --> 35:46.615
It's OK to sleep with me,
tell me you love me,

35:46.700 --> 35:49.976
but don't worry my pretty little head
with complex personal issues.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.937
I didn't think about that,
I didn't mean...

35:52.020 --> 35:54.978
I know you didn't mean.

35:55.060 --> 35:56.857
That's one of the reasons I love you.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.253
Mandy.

36:06.340 --> 36:07.739
I thought you had a shoo-in.

36:09.340 --> 36:10.773
Mandy.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.534
- He's an idiot.
- No, <i>you're</i> an idiot.

36:17.620 --> 36:19.895
And I'm even more of one
for listening to you.

36:21.620 --> 36:24.532
If your gaydar's as fucked up
as your straight antenna,

36:24.620 --> 36:26.292
you'll be single a long time, lan.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.853
< (Shane) Hurry up, will you?

36:29.940 --> 36:32.818
< Or I'll come and do it for you.
She'll be back in a minute.

36:49.580 --> 36:51.093
A black eye would have done it.

36:54.820 --> 36:58.813
What a day. I've acquired a family
I didn't even know,

36:58.900 --> 37:01.050
even though they took
a bit of persuading.

37:01.140 --> 37:03.608
Nice people, though,
once I sat down with them.

37:05.980 --> 37:06.935
Debs.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.136
We have to tell her.

37:11.740 --> 37:16.291
- We can't.
- I know. I know it's a massive risk, but...

37:17.740 --> 37:23.975
- I have to. She's my sister-in-law, as good as.
- Just wait till your birthday.

37:24.060 --> 37:29.532
Have you any idea how she'll be feeling
right now? I can't lie to her. It wouldn't be fair.

37:29.620 --> 37:31.053
I could go to jail!

37:32.180 --> 37:34.819
I don't want to jinx us
by being unkind to someone.

37:43.140 --> 37:44.937
Sweetheart, you all right?

37:45.020 --> 37:46.612
Don't tell Debbie!

37:51.220 --> 37:53.780
Why? What you doing?

37:55.380 --> 37:57.257
I like looking... poor.

37:59.580 --> 38:03.698
People underestimate you and then
if you achieve something, it's a big deal.

38:04.900 --> 38:07.209
A working-class hero's
something to be, Mum.

38:08.700 --> 38:10.179
Please don't tell Debbie. >

38:10.260 --> 38:11.818
She wouldn't understand.

38:16.100 --> 38:18.694
You could always
burst a pen in your pocket.

38:18.780 --> 38:21.658
Cos ink never washes out.

38:23.900 --> 38:25.458
< Aw...!

38:26.620 --> 38:28.497
Cheers. How did you get on?

38:28.580 --> 38:32.016
- Dunno. I'm not sure if she liked it.
- How do you mean?

38:32.100 --> 38:35.888
You know the finger up the arse thing?
I don't know if I timed it right.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.540
You might have to talk me through it again.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.293
- Somebody's been out on the town.
- He's had a date.

38:41.380 --> 38:42.893
Oh, yeah? Who with?

38:42.980 --> 38:46.575
- Tracey Kelvin. I was just giving him a few tips.
- Who's Tracey Kelvin?

38:46.660 --> 38:49.618
< Oh, some vastly experienced
teen sexual predator.

38:49.700 --> 38:52.294
- Who's a sexual predator?
- What's it got to do with you?

38:52.380 --> 38:54.814
I'm Tracey Kelvin.
What's he been saying?

38:54.900 --> 38:56.777
Nothing. I've not said nothing.

38:56.860 --> 39:01.172
He said you knew stuff none of us had ever
heard of. Foreign stuff from your other lovers.

39:01.260 --> 39:04.058
- Is he calling me a slapper?
- No.

39:04.140 --> 39:05.653
Did you ride him or not?

39:05.740 --> 39:09.096
Did I fuck!
I won't let him go anywhere near me.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.818
He's not even got his own car.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.094
So why?

39:12.180 --> 39:14.410
It were just a joke.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.133
He was getting you to talk dirty.

39:18.220 --> 39:19.175
What?!

39:21.620 --> 39:26.216
He was getting you to talk dirty
so he could go home for a bit of DIY.

39:26.300 --> 39:29.451
I showed him that thing
you do with your tongue.

39:29.540 --> 39:31.815
You little bastard!

39:35.100 --> 39:37.011
What thing with his tongue?

39:43.460 --> 39:44.415
What's going on?

39:47.980 --> 39:50.130
God Almighty! What happened?

39:50.220 --> 39:53.178
The Jocks.
They caught up with him on the estate.

39:53.260 --> 39:55.694
< He had no chance.
It was a massacre.

39:55.780 --> 39:58.214
What are you going to do?!

39:58.300 --> 40:00.256
Me?

40:00.340 --> 40:01.932
Not a thing.

40:02.020 --> 40:05.808
There's a new ethos in this house,
and I won't be the one who rocks the boat.

40:15.180 --> 40:18.172
Oi! Sheep-shaggers!

40:18.260 --> 40:20.057
Get 'em!

40:21.740 --> 40:23.298
That's my girl!

40:26.820 --> 40:29.573
What's so important?
You nearly woke Katie.

40:30.900 --> 40:33.460
Is something wrong?

40:33.540 --> 40:35.576
- It's me.
- What is?

40:36.820 --> 40:37.775
Tom.

40:38.980 --> 40:42.256
I'm sorry he didn't tell you.
I wasn't sure myself what I thought.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.808
No, you don't understand.

40:46.420 --> 40:49.253
I mean, it's me.
I'm the someone he's seeing.

40:50.700 --> 40:52.497
Don't be stupid.
You're only a kid.

40:55.220 --> 40:58.451
- But he's...
- 26. And I'm nearly 16.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.049
It's illegal.

41:03.140 --> 41:05.734
- It's disgusting!
- We love each other.

41:05.820 --> 41:08.892
Oh, grow up. How can you know
what love is at your age?

41:08.980 --> 41:11.938
How old were you
when you got pregnant with Katie?

41:12.020 --> 41:14.136
That was different.
We were both kids.

41:14.220 --> 41:17.576
And love came after,
out of necessity.

41:17.660 --> 41:21.812
Isn't it better doing it this way round?
I'm not going to get pregnant. I'm not naive.

41:21.900 --> 41:25.449
What? Cos you got two lessons in biology,
you know what it's all about?

41:25.540 --> 41:28.213
You're the one always telling me
how grown-up I am. >

41:28.300 --> 41:30.211
A 20-year-old head
on 15-year-old shoulders.

41:30.300 --> 41:32.336
I couldn't have been more wrong, could I?

41:32.420 --> 41:35.412
You love him? You've been
reading too many magazines.

41:35.500 --> 41:38.970
Look, I'm sorry he hurt you.
He didn't mean it.

41:39.060 --> 41:41.051
Fuck off. He didn't hurt me.

41:41.140 --> 41:43.859
I'd had a couple of drinks, that's all.
Lost my head.

41:43.940 --> 41:45.896
KNOCK AT DOOR

41:53.620 --> 41:56.612
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't let you do it on your own, could I?

41:56.700 --> 41:58.850
Didn't know what
you might be facing.

42:00.100 --> 42:02.170
What if someone sees?

42:05.060 --> 42:06.413
Well, then, so be it.

42:14.180 --> 42:15.374
I didn't realise.

42:15.460 --> 42:18.816
Stop apologising.
You're pathetic, the pair of you.

42:18.900 --> 42:21.494
- You won't say anything?
- What am I gonna say?

42:21.580 --> 42:24.140
A bloke gave me a body swerve
cos he prefers children?

42:25.260 --> 42:27.535
- She's not a child.
- She's not a woman.

42:28.700 --> 42:29.974
We didn't do it lightly.

42:31.140 --> 42:33.495
- It took a long time.
- That's worse.

42:33.580 --> 42:36.253
- We'd like to keep it quiet...
- I'll bet you would.

42:36.340 --> 42:38.570
...till Debbie's birthday.

42:38.660 --> 42:40.252
Please, Mandy.

42:44.500 --> 42:48.459
I won't say anything. But when it goes belly up,
don't come running.

43:02.700 --> 43:04.816
Look, things could get tricky.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.811
Shh.

43:06.900 --> 43:08.538
I'll talk to you in the morning.

43:35.380 --> 43:37.689
(Liam) 'I don't think
I'll bother growing up.

43:37.780 --> 43:42.012
'AII that aggro, and for what?
To be kicked out of your bed?

43:42.100 --> 43:46.810
'Resented for growing a life inside you?

43:46.900 --> 43:49.334
'The lies and the politics,

43:49.420 --> 43:52.093
'sneaking around,

43:52.180 --> 43:55.775
'opening yourself up
to all sorts of hurt and pain.

43:58.820 --> 44:01.573
'And for what? Companionship?

44:01.660 --> 44:04.458
'Someone to hold onto in bed at night?

44:04.540 --> 44:08.772
'You can be your own company.
Hold on to yourself in bed.

44:08.860 --> 44:12.455
'Carl does every night
when he thinks I'm sleeping.

44:12.540 --> 44:16.169
'In the olden days, they used to give drugs
to gymnasts from East Germany

44:16.260 --> 44:19.138
'to keep them children
for as long as possible.

44:19.220 --> 44:22.656
'Wonder if I could get my hands
on any of those.'

45:02.220 --> 45:05.656
Course, it was my choice
to move on from Corrie.

45:05.740 --> 45:10.939
I'm more of an all-round entertainer,
rather than just a one-trick pony.

45:11.020 --> 45:14.729
I've done two cruises
round the Shetland Isles.

45:14.820 --> 45:17.380
Yeah. Three seasons at Skegness.

45:17.460 --> 45:21.851
Hey, hey, hey! Bobby Davro, eh?
Oh, he's a lovely man...
