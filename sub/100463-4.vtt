WEBVTT

04:12.620 --> 04:14.247
No liquids.

04:14.670 --> 04:15.785
This goes through.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.730
Go ahead.

05:14.980 --> 05:15.969
Hello, Neto.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.560
Look.

05:23.480 --> 05:26.449
Brought you this in case you already
drank all the other ones I sent.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.525
I don't like this shit.

05:36.330 --> 05:37.661
Can we talk?

05:41.250 --> 05:43.662
I know why you're here. They got Zuno.

05:44.550 --> 05:45.756
In the States.

05:47.130 --> 05:49.007
He talks, you're done.

05:49.930 --> 05:50.965
Yeah?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.386
What else have you heard?

05:53.470 --> 05:54.630
That...

05:56.480 --> 05:58.892
the plazas are restless.

05:59.850 --> 06:04.776
Trouble at the top makes room
for new blood.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.896
Some you know, some you don't.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.651
You were right about Camarena.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.406
It really fucked up everything.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.456
And now you want my help.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.707
Know the thing about prison?

06:25.800 --> 06:27.040
You're never alone.

06:28.050 --> 06:30.883
But it always feels like you are.

06:32.970 --> 06:35.882
You sit in your fancy house...

06:37.600 --> 06:41.343
with your trophy wife,
with that monkey, Azul...

06:42.560 --> 06:44.608
You've got all these people around you...

06:45.480 --> 06:47.641
but the truth is you've got no one.

06:47.740 --> 06:52.939
'Cause you chose a bunch
of dirtbag lawyers and politicians

06:53.030 --> 06:54.611
-over your friends.
-Yeah?

06:54.700 --> 06:57.407
Since then, I don't solve your problems.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.243
What do you want me to do,
ask your forgiveness?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.917
I did what I had to do, you know that.

07:08.420 --> 07:13.175
Must be tiring, convincing yourself
you're the good guy.

07:17.930 --> 07:20.012
I made a deal with the Gulf.

07:22.270 --> 07:23.476
Wow.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.897
You got Guerra to move into coke?

07:27.610 --> 07:28.565
Yeah.

07:29.440 --> 07:33.228
And I'm going to use it to force
the Colombians to pay us in product.

07:33.610 --> 07:35.908
So we can move into retail.

07:37.030 --> 07:39.078
You and your fucking plans.

07:39.700 --> 07:43.659
Neto, are you listening?
We're going to be selling over there.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.087
When I'm done,
I'll be the most powerful man in Mexico,

07:46.170 --> 07:48.126
and I promise to get you out of here.

07:51.380 --> 07:54.884
But I can't with that fucking American
still choking me.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.255
He really got to you.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.709
I need it to go away.

08:01.140 --> 08:02.266
Okay.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.516
Here's what you should do.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.607
You're gonna turn yourself in
to the Americans.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.930
Turn myself in.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.481
It's easy.

08:13.990 --> 08:17.869
Walk right up to Uncle Sam and say,
"I surrender."

08:18.330 --> 08:19.365
That's it.

08:20.290 --> 08:22.497
You've gotta give the Americans
what they want.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.957
And if they want you, you're fucked.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.581
This will never end.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.706
Neven

08:29.800 --> 08:33.964
So get your ass into an American prison
'cause, if you get done in Mexico,

08:34.050 --> 08:37.508
I've got a feeling you'll end up in a cell
right next to mine.

08:38.970 --> 08:42.303
And when the animals in here,

08:42.390 --> 08:45.188
like Rafa, come to cut you open...

08:46.020 --> 08:49.808
I'll make sure they go nice and slow.

10:33.090 --> 10:37.208
So we'll do it in Panama.
I'll set the meeting with the Colombians.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.962
I'll get Noriega to send security.

10:40.050 --> 10:43.258
Type of thing that'll impress Colombians.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.466
That's a good idea.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.300
I'm very much looking forward

10:47.390 --> 10:51.144
to seeing you wipe the smug looks
off those sons of bitches' faces.

10:51.230 --> 10:53.892
So sometime next week?

10:53.980 --> 10:56.778
I hope it’s taken care of by then.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.934
Hope what's taken care of?

10:59.450 --> 11:00.735
Your prob/em.

11:00.820 --> 11:02.560
In America.

11:03.870 --> 11:04.939
Zuno.

11:06.990 --> 11:08.867
Yeah. I'm on it.

11:12.670 --> 11:13.625
All right, then.

11:13.710 --> 11:17.294
But F/ILY, have you heard
about this thing with Malta ’5 plane?

11:18.630 --> 11:21.337
The plane was shot down
over the Nicaraguan jungle.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.500
Indications are it was connected
to the CIA.

11:23.590 --> 11:28.801
The weapons were headed to the Contras
battling the communist Sand/histas.

11:28.890 --> 11:31.347
The downing of the plane
has raised questions in Washington

11:31.440 --> 11:33.977
about a poss/b/e secret arms deal.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.810
You know what, Azul?

11:45.740 --> 11:48.948
Tell that idiot Matta
I want to meet right now.

11:50.790 --> 11:51.950
Go on, then.

13:53.410 --> 13:55.651
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

13:55.750 --> 13:59.322
A little to the left. A little more.
There it is.

13:59.420 --> 14:00.739
Lower, lower, lower.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.831
I'll warn you. Lower, lower, lower.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.332
We can fill up three or more of those.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.125
-Three?
-Yeah.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.963
We'll have to hire
a shitload of people then.

14:12.050 --> 14:15.554
No problem. Acosta waves his finger,
shit gets done.

14:17.060 --> 14:20.143
Respect and fear go a long way.

14:20.980 --> 14:23.608
So we store the coke there?

14:24.440 --> 14:25.429
Yeah.

14:25.530 --> 14:27.896
Can't bust what they can't see.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.269
What now?

14:29.950 --> 14:31.736
Who the fuck is this?

14:31.820 --> 14:34.072
Fuck me. Acosta's gringa.

14:40.250 --> 14:41.911
How are you, love?

14:43.920 --> 14:45.706
Is this going to be a problem?

14:48.920 --> 14:50.171
I'll handle it.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.631
A fucking tax, Palma?

14:55.720 --> 14:57.551
To use the Tijuana plaza?

14:57.640 --> 15:01.974
When the time is right,
I'll talk to Flix, get him to lift it.

15:03.020 --> 15:06.274
They kick us in the balls,
and we sit here and do nothing?

15:07.690 --> 15:08.930
For now, we pay it.

15:11.950 --> 15:14.066
And adjust our volume through the ports.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.402
-Look, Palma, I got an idea--
-You're not an idea guy, Chapito.

15:21.580 --> 15:24.492
Have you made sure all the trucks
are running well?

15:25.840 --> 15:26.829
Done.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.040
Very good.

15:36.010 --> 15:37.307
Follow me, please.

15:47.690 --> 15:49.601
Nice place.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.850
Thank you for seeing me.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.031
So how are you?

16:00.040 --> 16:03.498
I've got 200 kilos of coke I want you
to help me move over the border.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.831
Who sold them to you?

16:09.460 --> 16:10.449
Cali?

16:11.090 --> 16:13.126
They're not the only ones that have coke.

16:14.090 --> 16:15.921
My brothers would kill you
if they found out--

16:16.010 --> 16:17.250
Benjamn already knows.

16:21.270 --> 16:22.885
I see they don't tell you everything.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.509
Their mistake.

16:27.110 --> 16:28.225
Oh, really?

16:28.980 --> 16:31.892
We start with this load, then expand.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.060
Move a ton a month, our way.

16:35.950 --> 16:37.986
-If Flix finds out--
-He comes after me.

16:38.620 --> 16:40.156
You hide in Benjamn's shadow.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.163
Flix pushes your family around,
but what's he delivered?

16:46.250 --> 16:48.081
Seizures are up.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.956
I hear he hasn't even paid you.

16:50.750 --> 16:54.334
He was done
the second he killed that DEA agent.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.210
I offer you the future.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.676
Your own supply.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.437
Look”.

17:07.350 --> 17:09.011
you've asked twice.

17:11.110 --> 17:13.066
My family's patience has run out.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.902
I suggest you leave Tijuana. Now.

17:28.460 --> 17:30.837
I thought you were the brains
behind your brothers.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.256
What'd you expect?

17:33.340 --> 17:36.173
Turn my back on my family
because we're both women?

17:38.680 --> 17:39.840
Why not?

17:56.780 --> 17:58.236
Come in.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.730
I'll make room.

18:12.090 --> 18:14.456
I'm not a bath guy.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.256
Hey, watch it!

18:18.010 --> 18:19.500
My boots!

18:26.060 --> 18:27.470
What do you think about Amado?

18:30.850 --> 18:34.308
He's different than you, that's for sure.

18:35.940 --> 18:36.929
Yes.

18:39.070 --> 18:40.731
They all are now.

18:43.660 --> 18:45.287
Game's changing.

18:47.250 --> 18:48.820
Passing you by?

18:50.670 --> 18:51.819
No.

18:52.460 --> 18:54.496
Pissing me off.

18:57.130 --> 18:59.212
Maybe it's time to stop.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.436
That why you came out here?

19:13.520 --> 19:15.476
To tell me I've had enough?

19:17.570 --> 19:20.562
You do what you want, Pablo. I know that.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.235
And you?

19:24.620 --> 19:27.362
You've got this way of getting me
to do what you want.

19:28.700 --> 19:32.534
Like I could tell Pablo Acosta what to do.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.132
Hey! I said quit it!

19:55.020 --> 19:59.434
Not with the boots on, no!
No, Pablo, no! Please!

20:01.610 --> 20:02.907
There!

20:03.990 --> 20:05.776
Always get your way.

20:12.830 --> 20:14.661
If you stopped working...

20:15.710 --> 20:19.089
there'd be more baths and less runways.

20:22.090 --> 20:23.796
Smell better, for sure.

20:29.810 --> 20:31.425
They don't respect me.

20:32.140 --> 20:35.143
Palma thinks I'm a joke,
won't listen to my ideas.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.469
Fucking tired of it.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.390
Language,Joaqun.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.140
Sorry, Ma.

20:43.240 --> 20:47.483
"Do this, drive here, shoot him..."

20:47.950 --> 20:49.577
Like a child.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.361
You've always been strong, son.

20:52.450 --> 20:55.533
You used to take a beating
from your father

20:55.620 --> 20:58.669
so your brothers and sisters
didn't have to.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.416
Know why?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.161
Because you're different.

21:03.260 --> 21:07.173
You surprise people, Joaqun.

21:07.260 --> 21:09.751
They underestimate you.

21:11.350 --> 21:13.511
You're a protector.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.307
Always looking out for your own.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.517
But who protects you, my little lion?

21:21.190 --> 21:22.521
You, Ma.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.890
Who else?

21:27.280 --> 21:28.440
Cochi?

21:31.740 --> 21:33.571
Our Lord, Jesus Christ.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.742
Was gonna say that next.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.202
He came from nothing, like you, son.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.837
Turn to Him for answers.

21:45.340 --> 21:47.877
And He'll help you build
your kingdom, too.

22:38.850 --> 22:40.147
You were in Honduras?

22:40.230 --> 22:41.800
Building another school.

22:42.980 --> 22:44.311
You should try it.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.107
-It's good for the soul.
-I'm sure.

22:48.200 --> 22:53.228
Feeling guilty about all those M16s
you've been sending south?

22:54.990 --> 22:56.742
I just carry the guns.

22:56.830 --> 22:58.900
These other assholes shoot them.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.281
You have any issues with that plane
that got shot down?

23:05.000 --> 23:07.207
Some, in the States.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.831
I'm confident it'll blow over.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.847
I need to talk with your friends
in the CIA.

23:17.810 --> 23:19.425
The people who want to arrest you?

23:19.520 --> 23:23.104
-The DEA and CIA aren't the same.
-You can't trust them.

23:23.190 --> 23:28.105
They'll have you on a direct flight
to the States before you can say a word.

23:29.490 --> 23:33.699
Not when they see how much money I have
for their Nicaraguan friends.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.365
You want to buy their help.

23:38.370 --> 23:39.439
Yes.

23:40.370 --> 23:42.452
Walk right up to Uncle Sam...

23:43.540 --> 23:45.201
and give him what he wants.

23:45.790 --> 23:48.293
Untraceable cash.
They love that, don't they?

23:49.050 --> 23:51.291
How much did I give them last time?

23:51.380 --> 23:52.369
Two million?

23:55.430 --> 23:57.421
What if I give them ten this time?

23:58.220 --> 23:59.426
Just to start.

24:01.350 --> 24:03.306
CIA's nothing if not opportunistic.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.686
But you'll have to be careful, Flix.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.776
You killed one of them.

24:13.320 --> 24:14.730
They don't forget that.

24:17.030 --> 24:19.362
Then I'll make them forget.

24:26.210 --> 24:27.450
What the hell are we doing here?

24:29.090 --> 24:30.626
I bought it.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.045
You bought this warehouse?

24:35.640 --> 24:36.755
Come.

24:38.050 --> 24:39.256
This way.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.720
Look that way.

24:47.190 --> 24:48.145
See the border?

24:48.940 --> 24:50.851
-Yes.
-See that house?

24:51.360 --> 24:52.850
With the green roof?

24:53.280 --> 24:54.520
Yeah, I see it.

24:55.530 --> 24:56.519
Bought that one, too.

24:57.780 --> 24:59.520
You bought that dump?

24:59.620 --> 25:02.248
It's 442 meters from here to that house.

25:03.370 --> 25:04.860
And I'm gonna connect them.

25:07.210 --> 25:08.780
I'm going to build a tunnel, Cochi.

25:10.710 --> 25:14.669
You're going to build a tunnel under
the US. border, from here to there?

25:14.760 --> 25:16.796
This is your big idea?

25:16.890 --> 25:18.539
That's right.

25:18.640 --> 25:22.053
All the fancy shit they got
to keep us out...

25:22.140 --> 25:24.882
planes, cameras, fences...

25:27.730 --> 25:29.686
still one place the gringos never look.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.482
You've fucking lost your mind.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.481
Think about it, man.

25:40.620 --> 25:43.612
This... protects us from everything.

25:43.700 --> 25:47.454
From the brothers, the tax,
and U.S. Customs.

25:48.670 --> 25:50.080
All of it, Cochi.

25:50.170 --> 25:51.797
What'd Palma say?

25:52.340 --> 25:54.376
Doesn't want to listen to my ideas.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.871
So I'm gonna build it and show him after.

25:57.380 --> 25:59.177
He'll come on board when he sees it.

25:59.260 --> 26:02.058
Come on, man.
You didn't make it past the third grade.

26:02.140 --> 26:04.847
How the fuck are you gonna build
a 400-meter tunnel?

26:06.850 --> 26:07.760
No, brother.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.603
I love you, but we're hitters.

26:11.690 --> 26:13.180
That's what we do.

26:15.610 --> 26:16.850
Not forever.

26:24.580 --> 26:26.571
Guess we're building a fucking tunnel.

26:28.750 --> 26:29.865
Let's do it.

26:31.630 --> 26:33.495
We'll start today.

27:54.380 --> 27:55.495
Follow me.

28:06.260 --> 28:07.807
Mr. Flix Gallardo.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.056
Relax.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.181
He's just going to pat him down.

28:25.030 --> 28:27.078
All right. Follow me.

28:29.830 --> 28:30.945
It's okay.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.325
Hand me that.

28:32.410 --> 28:33.536
I'll be back.

28:38.500 --> 28:39.831
How goes it?

28:40.960 --> 28:42.336
Well, it's going, sir.

28:43.340 --> 28:46.002
I wasn't sure we'd pull it off,
but here we are.

28:46.090 --> 28:49.002
Of course.
I found the best contractor in Tijuana!

28:51.470 --> 28:52.801
Run!

28:58.650 --> 28:59.890
Come out!

29:02.240 --> 29:03.605
Come out! Come out!

29:03.700 --> 29:05.190
What the fuck happened?

29:06.160 --> 29:07.559
And Juan?

29:07.660 --> 29:08.979
Where's Juan?

32:51.630 --> 32:53.712
Wait! Where are you taking me?

32:53.800 --> 32:55.085
To the airplane.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.211
No, no. No way I'm getting in there.

32:58.890 --> 33:00.551
I'd rather talk out here.

33:00.640 --> 33:03.973
He's traveling through,
about to take off in ten minutes.

33:05.230 --> 33:06.549
I'm not getting aboard.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.026
You talk on the plane, or not at all.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.226
Take a seat. I'll translate.

33:48.400 --> 33:52.222
He said you have to stop meeting
in the jungle like this.

34:10.330 --> 34:12.298
It's an unfortunate event.

34:25.100 --> 34:27.512
Tell him I've got what he needs in here.

34:37.740 --> 34:38.638
What?

34:42.780 --> 34:44.031
What's he saying? Wait!

34:58.670 --> 35:00.376
Will you translate? What's he saying?

35:03.640 --> 35:05.460
Wait! Put that down!

35:05.560 --> 35:06.925
Tell him to open it!

35:07.020 --> 35:08.590
There's something in here you need.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.891
Open it.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.475
Tell him to open it!

35:35.840 --> 35:40.209
Of the routes I'll use
to fly your guns through the region.

35:41.930 --> 35:44.046
One of Matta's planes was shot down,
correct?

35:45.010 --> 35:47.763
And your Congress knows about it?

35:50.850 --> 35:53.307
How long before that comes back to Matta?

35:54.230 --> 35:58.394
How long before your whole arms program
here is torched because of it?

36:07.830 --> 36:11.618
I'll take over his entire organization.
It will be mine.

36:11.710 --> 36:16.409
I'll make sure you'll continue
to get your guns and money.

36:16.500 --> 36:19.003
But I'll hide them
in one of my shell companies.

36:20.260 --> 36:21.716
See what I'm getting at?

36:22.510 --> 36:24.296
The investigation won't matter.

36:24.890 --> 36:27.597
Imagine: new routes, new airstrips.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.922
Your program goes on,
and no one will know.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.139
Exactly.

36:47.530 --> 36:48.576
What did he say?

36:53.210 --> 36:54.325
That's good.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.661
So do we have a deal?

37:10.430 --> 37:12.557
Wait, wait! The DEA, I understood.

37:12.640 --> 37:14.471
The DEA worries me a lot.

37:15.350 --> 37:16.590
This is the deal:

37:17.310 --> 37:19.437
I take care of this,
you take care of the DEA.

37:19.520 --> 37:21.522
The CIA can manage that, right?

43:25.760 --> 43:27.512
Bro... it's over.

43:29.230 --> 43:33.269
Chapo. No point digging him out
of a perfectly good grave.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.100
We need to get the hell out of here.

43:35.730 --> 43:37.857
I don't give a fuck.
He's blocking my tunnel.

43:37.940 --> 43:39.396
We have to see the signs.

43:39.490 --> 43:40.525
We can't keep going.

43:50.620 --> 43:52.576
Chapo, is that Juan?

44:06.890 --> 44:08.710
This is the sign, Cochi.

44:11.770 --> 44:13.726
He who perseveres, conquers.

44:22.030 --> 44:26.615
Appreciate you coming back to Jurez,
Pablo. I mean it.

44:28.370 --> 44:30.440
Gave me no choice, Dopey.

44:32.790 --> 44:35.497
All a man's got is his word, no?

44:38.050 --> 44:39.415
Hello, love.

44:40.920 --> 44:42.672
-How are you?
-Hi, Amado.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.421
That's how you greet a lady?

44:51.980 --> 44:53.095
Hello, Mimi.

44:55.100 --> 44:57.182
He didn't know I was coming, did he?

44:57.900 --> 45:00.027
Thought you two
could get to know each other.

45:00.900 --> 45:03.812
Besides, who doesn't like surprises?

45:05.160 --> 45:07.060
Isn't he a pain in the ass?

45:14.210 --> 45:15.359
Time for a smoke.

45:16.420 --> 45:20.834
Just gotta add a little something,
so it's nice and perfect.

45:21.260 --> 45:23.660
Mind smoking that outside, hon?

45:25.430 --> 45:26.465
That's fine.

45:27.590 --> 45:29.501
I'll just fuck off for a bit.

45:38.730 --> 45:39.719
Amado...

45:48.030 --> 45:51.818
You know as well as I,
Pablo doesn't wanna be here.

45:52.290 --> 45:55.248
I think it's time he settles down.

45:55.330 --> 45:57.537
Are you trying to get him killed?

45:57.620 --> 45:59.781
You know people don't retire
in our line of work.

45:59.880 --> 46:04.249
Yeah, well, Pablo's not most "people."
You know that.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.870
You just here to put that nonsense
in his head?

46:06.970 --> 46:11.088
He gets to come home for good,
and you get to run Jurez.

46:12.010 --> 46:16.049
And I don't have to watch him
risk his life for this bullshit anymore.

46:18.650 --> 46:22.723
You got some balls. I mean--

46:22.820 --> 46:24.856
I know what you mean.

46:32.740 --> 46:35.117
He pisses me off.

46:36.580 --> 46:38.366
But yeah, I like him.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.535
Well...

46:41.500 --> 46:45.709
Look, I'm just trying to look out for him.
To protect him.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.830
I could use your help.

46:50.430 --> 46:51.545
Look, Mimi...

46:55.020 --> 46:57.887
if Pablo decides to get out...

46:58.940 --> 47:02.103
I can't protect him from Flix.

47:02.190 --> 47:03.680
Not you, not anybody.

47:03.770 --> 47:07.069
You want him safe?
Then we have to keep him in Jurez.

47:08.280 --> 47:09.440
It's the only way.

47:11.570 --> 47:12.730
Understand?

47:17.500 --> 47:18.899
I'll do what I can.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.661
Don't worry, boss.

47:24.750 --> 47:26.160
We'll figure it out.

47:33.010 --> 47:34.090
Sergio.

47:34.970 --> 47:36.801
Your friend, what's he like?

47:36.890 --> 47:40.553
He's a piece of shit. But at this point...

47:47.480 --> 47:48.526
Set it up.

47:49.570 --> 47:50.696
You got it.

48:02.670 --> 48:04.581
Why are you up? Can't sleep?

48:08.210 --> 48:11.759
Five a.m. roll call in prison
right about now.

48:16.350 --> 48:17.590
You look the same.

48:20.930 --> 48:23.808
Well, maybe a little more tired,
but the same.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.050
Gee, thanks.

48:28.230 --> 48:29.276
Yeah.

48:30.240 --> 48:32.356
Well, it's tiring
trying to protect this family.

48:33.610 --> 48:35.362
Try sitting in prison.

48:36.700 --> 48:39.157
Then talk to me about "protecting family."

48:44.880 --> 48:46.199
You regret it?

48:48.130 --> 48:49.119
Yes.

48:51.090 --> 48:53.797
Can't get back the time I lost.

48:57.100 --> 49:01.093
But... it was my call, no?

49:01.180 --> 49:03.091
Not Benjamn's. Or Ramn's.

49:03.560 --> 49:04.640
Mine.

49:09.070 --> 49:11.857
Must be nice making your own choices.

49:15.200 --> 49:17.907
It's become more apparent to me that...

49:18.910 --> 49:21.743
all we've got are the choices we make.

52:41.190 --> 52:43.488
Sergio didn ’t mention you were so pretty.

52:44.490 --> 52:46.731
Nice to meet you. Please, join me.

52:47.330 --> 52:48.866
Thank you, that's all.

52:50.250 --> 52:53.208
Sit. Would you like anything to drink?

52:53.290 --> 52:54.325
No, thank you.

52:55.250 --> 52:56.877
How can I help you?

52:57.290 --> 52:59.542
I hear you've got a six-figure debt
at the tracks.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.126
Well, yeah...

53:02.760 --> 53:04.671
I pick winners on occasion.

53:05.220 --> 53:08.348
Well, I've got product
that can pay it off.

53:08.430 --> 53:09.590
Just need you to move it.

53:11.470 --> 53:15.474
Moving coke without the brothers'
approval? That's a big risk.

53:16.860 --> 53:18.316
Split's 60/40.

53:18.860 --> 53:21.476
Fair, considering you need me.
And the money.

53:24.740 --> 53:26.480
Forty percent?

53:29.830 --> 53:31.320
We've got a deal.

53:34.120 --> 53:36.782
But I'd like to get to know you
better first...

53:36.880 --> 53:39.166
and then I'll move your coke.

53:39.840 --> 53:42.001
I've got a shower in the back
big enough for the both of us.

53:43.670 --> 53:45.126
Who the fuck are you?

53:46.800 --> 53:47.835
Hello.

53:51.970 --> 53:54.723
Think you could make a deal in my town
without me knowing?

53:54.810 --> 53:56.016
And with this piece of shit?

53:56.560 --> 53:58.767
Enedina, she came to me.

53:58.860 --> 54:01.852
You ever been shot in the nuts, Nieves?

54:02.690 --> 54:05.318
I understand it's the most painful thing
you can do to a man.

54:05.400 --> 54:08.528
They explode... like grapes.

54:10.030 --> 54:13.079
_ A bullet in each of them
If you step out on us again.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.206
Is that clear, man?

54:16.870 --> 54:17.950
Absolutely.

54:21.170 --> 54:22.046
Take her.

54:22.550 --> 54:23.539
Let go of me!

54:24.550 --> 54:26.165
Fuck, Enedina!

54:39.560 --> 54:40.936
I told you to leave Tijuana.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.060
You obviously don't know me.

54:54.580 --> 54:56.070
I'll move your coke.

54:58.830 --> 55:01.071
But make no mistake...

55:02.040 --> 55:03.667
I call the shots.

55:06.630 --> 55:08.370
All right, let's do it.

55:15.310 --> 55:17.767
Hey, hold up, hold up.

55:19.730 --> 55:21.436
You built that?

55:24.230 --> 55:25.720
Honestly, I didn't think you could do it.

55:26.820 --> 55:28.526
But you still stuck by me.

55:31.950 --> 55:33.656
I'm gonna need people like you.

55:37.500 --> 55:40.242
Half a fucking tunnel,
and you think you're a boss.

55:41.920 --> 55:43.069
Fucking Chapo.

55:50.220 --> 55:51.209
Shit.

55:51.890 --> 55:52.879
Shut that off.

55:56.850 --> 55:58.135
What's up, Palma?

55:58.220 --> 55:59.221
Hey, Palma.

56:05.650 --> 56:07.436
Welcome to my tunnel.

56:08.530 --> 56:10.270
I call it "Cocaine Alley."

56:14.410 --> 56:18.232
Boss, we move the coke through here
instead of the port,

56:18.330 --> 56:20.901
and we save a lot of dough.

56:33.680 --> 56:34.886
Fuck.

56:35.850 --> 56:37.806
This is good work, Chapito.

56:40.230 --> 56:42.801
What're you assholes waiting for?

56:43.690 --> 56:46.227
Get to fucking work. Dig!

56:51.740 --> 56:54.152
Your nephew shared your name with them.

56:54.240 --> 56:57.073
If the Americans didn't know
what a piece of shit you were,

56:57.160 --> 56:58.479
they do now.

56:59.910 --> 57:02.367
We need to make sure the party
still supports you.

57:05.960 --> 57:07.370
So, what do we do?

58:05.600 --> 58:08.854
DRUG BARON MATI'A BALLESTEROS
CAPTURED IN HONDURAS

59:03.660 --> 59:05.446
COMMANDER
FEDERAL JUDICIAL POLICE
