WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:02.350
- Previously on "The Flash"...

00:03.351 --> 00:04.830
- So this is where
you've been hiding.

00:04.874 --> 00:08.269
I think you're afraid
to use your powers

00:08.312 --> 00:10.662
because you think you'll
become like someone you hate.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.099
- I know you're doing it
for all of us.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.361
That's what it means
to be a hero.

00:13.404 --> 00:14.840
- I knew I picked
the right guy.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.320
- He's gonna die.
- Frost, how do we save him?

00:16.364 --> 00:17.669
- I don't know!
I can't fix this.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.019
- Accepting Ramsey's blood

00:19.062 --> 00:20.890
would save your body
but not your soul.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.500
You would lose the best of you.

00:22.544 --> 00:23.936
The part of you
that Iris loves.

00:23.980 --> 00:24.937
- That's not Barry.

00:24.981 --> 00:25.938
- Barry.

00:28.985 --> 00:32.075
The entire world will embrace

00:32.119 --> 00:34.208
Bloodwork!

00:41.258 --> 00:42.912
- Are you guys okay?

00:42.955 --> 00:44.174
Yeah.

00:50.180 --> 00:52.052
- I don't understand.
That wasn't Barry.

00:52.095 --> 00:53.618
- Yeah, it was.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.881
Ramsey turned him into one
of his Blood Brothers.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.940
- Babel Protocols initiated.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.724
- What's Babel Protocols?

01:12.768 --> 01:14.074
I thought that was just
some defense stuff

01:14.117 --> 01:15.423
that you added to Barry's suit.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.120
- That was version one.

01:17.164 --> 01:19.079
Version 2.0 puts up a force
field around S.T.A.R. Labs.

01:19.122 --> 01:20.863
Nothing gets in,
nothing goes out--

01:20.906 --> 01:21.994
not even our comms.

01:22.038 --> 01:25.302
I built them just in case...

01:25.346 --> 01:27.130
just in case the Flash
ever went dark.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.610
- Barry said that
Ramsey gave him a choice.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.568
Why--why would he choose this?

01:30.612 --> 01:32.831
- Maybe he decided
eternal life was better

01:32.875 --> 01:34.224
than dying in Crisis.

01:34.268 --> 01:35.617
- Ramsey's using Barry.

01:35.660 --> 01:39.621
And whatever he's having
him do, he's got a plan.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.629
- You have a police scanner?

01:47.672 --> 01:49.674
- I'm hoping that since
this thing transmits in analog,

01:49.718 --> 01:52.808
we can figure out what's
going on outside S.T.A.R. Labs.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.157
- I don't get it.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.767
Why didn't Ramsey
just have Barry kill us

01:55.811 --> 01:57.247
as soon as he woke up?

01:57.291 --> 01:58.640
- I don't know,
but don't count us out yet,

01:58.683 --> 02:00.424
You know that tech
I've been working on?

02:00.468 --> 02:03.123
Meet the Photon Emitter.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.124
- So what, you built a ray gun?

02:04.167 --> 02:05.864
- It's not a ray gun,

02:05.908 --> 02:08.954
it's a weapon that can deliver
megadoses of photon radiation--

02:08.998 --> 02:10.391
the same kind of radiation

02:10.434 --> 02:12.306
typically administered
to cancer patients.

02:12.349 --> 02:13.959
- What exactly does it do?

02:14.003 --> 02:16.919
- My theory is that these
photons could be strong enough

02:16.962 --> 02:20.444
to destroy Ramsey's
sentient infection.

02:20.488 --> 02:21.880
If I get close enough
to blast him,

02:21.924 --> 02:23.882
he should revert back
to his human form.

02:23.926 --> 02:25.623
He'd still have HLH,

02:25.667 --> 02:28.191
but at least he wouldn't be a
gooey zombie overlord anymore.

02:28.235 --> 02:29.279
- What about everyone else
that was infected?

02:29.323 --> 02:30.498
Would they be cured?

02:30.541 --> 02:31.977
- Yes.
They'd lose the goo,

02:32.021 --> 02:33.109
they'd go back to normal.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.632
But since Ramsey's the only one

02:34.676 --> 02:37.026
that can create
more Blood Brothers,

02:37.069 --> 02:38.636
I say we hit at him first.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.986
Then Dark Flash.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.466
- And you've tested this?

02:42.510 --> 02:44.642
- Well, I haven't even
finished building it,

02:44.686 --> 02:47.210
so no, no I haven't tested it.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.472
- So let me get this straight.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.300
You wanna shoot radiation
at my husband

02:50.344 --> 02:52.302
out of some crazy
powerful device

02:52.346 --> 02:53.695
that you've never tested?

02:53.738 --> 02:55.914
- Iris, this is
the only plan we have.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.481
- This could kill Barry, Cisco.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.091
- Anyone there?
Please help me.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.528
The city's being overrun.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.094
I'm using
a police officer's radio.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.835
He's turning
into some kind of monster.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.315
His eyes are black.

03:05.359 --> 03:06.925
- Ramsey's spreading
his infection.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.232
- That's where he took down
communication citywide.

03:09.276 --> 03:12.061
Caitlin once said
Ramsey's infection sample

03:12.104 --> 03:15.369
indicate he needs his victims
to be afraid

03:15.412 --> 03:17.197
before he attacks them.

03:27.381 --> 03:28.469
- Hey,
is your Internet working?

03:30.862 --> 03:31.907
What's with the lights?

03:31.950 --> 03:33.474
- I don't know.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.127
- Who's that?

03:43.571 --> 03:45.834
- Get inside, get inside.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.924
- He looks like he has rabies
or something.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.795
- Mitch Romero--
you remember the mobster

03:50.839 --> 03:52.449
that Ramsey turned
into a Blood Brother?

03:52.493 --> 03:53.885
Well, Joe said that
he looked just like that.

03:53.929 --> 03:57.280
-  Come here.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.369
- What--what do we do?

03:59.413 --> 04:02.024
- We gotta get
out of this building.

04:07.812 --> 04:11.425
- Remember, these people
are innocent!

04:11.468 --> 04:13.862
Nonlethal force only!

04:20.434 --> 04:22.523
- Your efforts are in vain,
Captain.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.047
I'm going
to transform this city by dawn,

04:25.090 --> 04:26.570
and you can't stop me.

04:29.617 --> 04:31.662
- Stand down, Dr. Rosso.

04:31.706 --> 04:35.057
- Rosso's my human name,
and he had human plans.

04:35.100 --> 04:40.149
My name is Bloodwork now,
and I am not alone.

04:51.203 --> 04:52.596
- Flash, this isn't you.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.904
Whatever happened
to you, we will fix it.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.733
-  It's humanity
that needs fixing.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.267
- Why would you
let that happen?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.790
- 'Cause this isn't Barry
anymore.

05:14.531 --> 05:17.926
- Ramsey, whatever the hell
your plan is, we will stop you.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.275
- I've already done it.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.190
I've cured death...

05:21.233 --> 05:22.496
but not for you.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.892
- Continue our mission.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.241
Kill them.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.874
I'm coming for you.

05:52.917 --> 05:55.311
- You seek the truth.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.060
- Novu.

06:05.103 --> 06:06.670
- If you wish to know all,

06:06.714 --> 06:09.586
show your allegiance
and all will be revealed.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.371
- Yeah, that sounds great.
Oh, wait.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.503
No, I don't barter
with false gods!

06:13.547 --> 06:18.682
- Bow down to me and
all you desire shall be yours.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.902
- Let me in.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.294
Let me in!

06:22.338 --> 06:25.689
- Bow down to me!

06:25.733 --> 06:27.735
Planet after planet...

06:27.778 --> 06:29.693
Earth after Earth
I've tracked you, Novu,

06:29.737 --> 06:32.348
and you think
some paltry mind games

06:32.392 --> 06:34.524
and a little rock wall
is gonna stop me.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.047
You've got
another think coming.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.397
I'm coming for you.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.355
And you can't stop me!

06:48.973 --> 06:51.628
Hmm.

06:51.672 --> 06:52.586
What's this now?

06:52.629 --> 06:55.806
Punishment from an angry god...

06:55.850 --> 06:59.767
or simply faulty wiring?

06:59.810 --> 07:03.640
I say, let there be light.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.297
- Still nothing.

07:13.781 --> 07:17.785
- Hey, girl. We got this.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.874
We just need to get
to the end of the hallway

07:19.917 --> 07:21.092
and into the stairwell.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.442
- I'm sorry.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.356
I'm so sorry. I can't.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.706
I can't even move.

07:25.749 --> 07:26.750
- What's wrong?

07:26.794 --> 07:28.839
- Fear.

07:28.883 --> 07:31.538
There's so much fear,
and I can feel it,

07:31.581 --> 07:33.931
and I think there must be
other people in the building.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.237
- The place is empty.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.934
No one else
is working this late.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.807
- It's everywhere and I can't--
- Okay.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.765
- I can't stop it and
I can't keep it out of my head.

07:41.809 --> 07:44.464
- Okay, okay, okay.
I believe you. I believe you.

07:44.507 --> 07:48.380
Cisco told me that Ramsey
needs his victims to be scared

07:48.424 --> 07:49.773
for the infection to take.

07:49.817 --> 07:52.820
Something about
a fear-related amino acid.

07:52.863 --> 07:56.824
What if you're feeling
what those zombies are feeling?

07:56.867 --> 07:58.478
The fear inside them?

07:58.521 --> 08:00.610
- Whatever it is,
just make it stop.

08:00.654 --> 08:03.439
- Cecile, don't you get it?

08:03.483 --> 08:05.572
You're a fricking
zombie detector.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.225
You're our way out of here.

08:09.924 --> 08:12.143
- We've got another 207
downtown.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.798
All available units respond.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.626
- 207 is an abduction.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.889
There's been ten of those
in the last five minutes.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.979
- Iris, I know
you're listening.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.503
I need to see you.

08:23.546 --> 08:26.070
Meet me where
our life together began--

08:26.114 --> 08:27.419
where you said yes.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.336
- Iris--

08:31.380 --> 08:32.903
that's not him.

08:32.947 --> 08:35.210
That might sound like Barry,
it might even look like him,

08:35.253 --> 08:36.820
but that is Dark Flash.

08:36.864 --> 08:37.908
- You don't know that.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.606
What if Barry
is still alive in there?

08:39.649 --> 08:41.738
- What if it's a trap,
all right?

08:41.782 --> 08:43.958
We don't even have comms.
It's too risky.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.176
- Listen to me.

08:45.220 --> 08:46.569
I just need
to look him in his eyes.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.005
- If the Emitter doesn't work
on Ramsey,

08:48.049 --> 08:49.659
I get to come back
and try something else.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.618
But if you go out there
and that's not Barry,

08:51.661 --> 08:54.359
you could get infected
or worse.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.847
Please.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.771
- "In sickness and in health."

09:14.815 --> 09:16.033
- Iris.

09:16.077 --> 09:18.906
Iris!

09:27.915 --> 09:30.439
- Barry?

09:30.482 --> 09:33.224
Yes, Iris?

09:33.268 --> 09:36.750
It's me.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.491
And so much more.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.241
- Come on.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.375
- Ramsey.

09:53.418 --> 09:56.421
- Neat little trick, huh?

09:56.465 --> 09:58.423
Don't you see now, Iris?

09:58.467 --> 10:00.251
- Come on.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.130
- My control over

10:09.173 --> 10:13.438
my Blood Brothers and Sisters
is absolute.

10:13.482 --> 10:16.920
As more cured souls
accept my lifeblood,

10:16.964 --> 10:21.272
they become extensions
of one collective body--

10:21.316 --> 10:22.360
mine.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.449
- You asked me here.
Why?

10:24.493 --> 10:26.626
- To offer you a chance.

10:26.669 --> 10:30.760
Barry would want you to follow
him down this path he chose.

10:30.804 --> 10:31.587
- No.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.806
- The path of life.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.069
- You aren't saving lives,
Ramsey.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.637
You're destroying
what makes one beautiful.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.118
- Barry...

10:41.162 --> 10:45.470
I know you can hear me and
you can hear what I tell you--

10:45.514 --> 10:47.124
that I love you.

10:47.168 --> 10:50.127
And after everything that we've
been through together...

10:53.087 --> 10:56.960
I know that this
is not how our story ends.

10:57.004 --> 10:59.876
Come home to me.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.535
- Why would Barry
come home to you?

11:06.578 --> 11:09.756
You accepted his death
in Crisis as inevitable.

11:09.799 --> 11:13.194
What kind of wife
is willing to bury her husband?

11:13.237 --> 11:15.587
- Iris, get out of there.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.166
- In good time.

11:29.210 --> 11:33.257
This is not over.

11:33.301 --> 11:36.260
Trust me, Iris.

11:58.152 --> 12:00.197
- Are you okay?

12:00.241 --> 12:01.764
- No.

12:01.808 --> 12:05.028
- I piggybacked the audio
off the extrapolator.

12:09.119 --> 12:11.034
I'm sorry.

12:15.256 --> 12:19.434
- I have to try again.
- Iris...

12:19.477 --> 12:21.523
he almost killed you.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.395
- We can't just give up, Cisco.
- We're not.

12:24.439 --> 12:27.181
But if we're gonna take down
Bloodwork and Dark Flash,

12:27.224 --> 12:28.878
we need to do it
with the Photon Emitter.

12:28.922 --> 12:30.750
- You haven't even tested
that thing.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.577
- We have no time.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.057
Maybe you don't remember,

12:34.101 --> 12:35.929
but we actually have been
preparing for this for weeks.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.061
- No, we've been preparing
for the Flash to die

12:38.105 --> 12:40.760
trying to save this world,
not--not helping to destroy it.

12:40.803 --> 12:43.980
- It doesn't matter!
We were gonna lose him anyway!

12:47.288 --> 12:49.899
This is the moment
he prepared us for.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.080
- We still have four hours.

12:57.124 --> 13:00.780
That is 240 minutes,
and I am not letting Ramsey

13:00.823 --> 13:02.303
take a single one
of those from me.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.827
I am not giving up on Barry.
He's my husband.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.177
- He was.

13:07.221 --> 13:10.311
And he was my best friend.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.878
And no one's
giving up on anybody

13:11.921 --> 13:16.665
because there
is nothing left to give up on.

13:16.708 --> 13:17.927
Iris, he's gone.

13:20.451 --> 13:24.281
He was always gonna leave us.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.630
And whether or not
the Emitter works,

13:25.674 --> 13:28.068
it's not gonna change that.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.247
The Emitter's almost ready.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.640
And when it is
I'm gonna use it on Bloodwork,

13:35.684 --> 13:38.034
and I'm gonna use it
on Dark Flash.

13:50.960 --> 13:51.918
- Joe!

14:05.018 --> 14:06.976
- Just lie still.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.202
Get the hell away from her.

14:15.245 --> 14:16.420
- Allegra!

14:16.464 --> 14:18.553
- Frost!
Is Captain West okay?

14:18.596 --> 14:19.597
- No.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.686
We need
to get the hell out of here.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.340
Let's go.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.455
- Get right back.
Get right back.

15:14.565 --> 15:18.308
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

16:19.326 --> 16:20.283
- Come on!

16:20.327 --> 16:22.155
Oh, wait!

16:30.424 --> 16:31.816
Oh, my God.
Help me!

16:31.860 --> 16:33.340
- Oh, my God.

16:37.518 --> 16:38.823
That's not gonna hold
for very long.

16:38.867 --> 16:40.651
- S.T.A.R. Labs
is still ten blocks away.

16:40.695 --> 16:42.262
- Ten blocks?
Ten blocks?

16:42.305 --> 16:44.873
We can do it.
Let's go.

16:44.916 --> 16:48.920
- Rise, my Blood Brother
and Blood Sister.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.270
You are cured.

16:50.313 --> 16:53.099
Now you will never die.

17:10.246 --> 17:13.206
- Feel the burn, Bloodwork!

17:27.742 --> 17:31.006
Is that all you've got,
Mr. Ramon?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.877
Too bad.

17:32.921 --> 17:33.748
- Cisco!

17:33.791 --> 17:36.838
- My lifeblood is a gift.

17:36.881 --> 17:39.667
Are you ready to receive it?

17:43.584 --> 17:46.282
No.

17:46.326 --> 17:49.459
You have another purpose
to serve.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.113
The reckoning is near.

17:51.157 --> 17:56.118
My army is almost ready
to march on S.T.A.R. Labs.

17:56.162 --> 17:59.382
- What the hell do you want
with S.T.A.R. Labs?

18:05.997 --> 18:08.739
- The Particle Accelerator.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.786
- The very tech you helped
to create

18:11.829 --> 18:15.137
will be the vessel
carrying my glorious cure.

18:15.181 --> 18:18.880
Soon all of Central City
will be granted eternal life,

18:18.923 --> 18:23.406
and I choose you, Mr. Ramon,
to be my messenger.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.234
Go, tell your team

18:25.278 --> 18:28.411
the great S.T.A.R. Labs
Particle Accelerator

18:28.455 --> 18:31.240
is ready to fulfill
its true purpose.

18:31.284 --> 18:33.155
Salvation is nigh.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.288
- An ass-whipping
is nigh, pal...

18:37.333 --> 18:39.422
And you're gonna lose, Ramsey.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.771
You're gonna lose.

18:40.815 --> 18:45.776
- Plucky right up
until the end.

18:45.820 --> 18:50.172
I knew I picked the right guy.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.869
Iris!

18:51.913 --> 18:53.480
If you're listening...

18:53.523 --> 18:56.222
I'm coming home.

19:09.844 --> 19:12.238
- Look at this.

19:13.674 --> 19:14.979
Ramsey wasn't lying.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.199
Barry hacked
the Particle Accelerator.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.722
- He was getting it ready
for Bloodwork.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.072
That's why he was pretending
to be Barry.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.683
But why?

19:22.726 --> 19:24.989
- If Ramsey drops
even just a tiny amount

19:25.033 --> 19:27.775
of his blood into the core
and it explodes,

19:27.818 --> 19:29.342
the infectious cells
will aerosolize

19:29.385 --> 19:31.735
and it would affect
all of Central City in seconds.

19:31.779 --> 19:33.781
All you'd have to do
is take a breath.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.177
- Dad!

19:40.266 --> 19:41.745
Do something, Frost.

19:41.789 --> 19:46.315
- I can't--
I can't handle this.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.236
- There's a lot of blood loss.
Looks like a nicked spleen.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.977
Frost, I don't have
the equipment I need

19:56.020 --> 19:57.848
to close up this complicated
of a wound,

19:57.892 --> 19:59.372
but you can
with your ice powers.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.373
- I can't.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.679
- Yes, you can.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.028
Frost, come on.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.247
- After Ralph and Barry?

20:05.291 --> 20:08.337
- Frost, take control.
- How?

20:08.381 --> 20:10.948
- Let yourself feel the fear,
count to three,

20:10.992 --> 20:16.215
and do it anyway,
because that's what heroes do.

20:16.258 --> 20:19.522
One, two...

20:23.744 --> 20:24.701
- Three.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.506
You like that?

20:46.549 --> 20:48.203
You like that?

21:14.360 --> 21:17.754
- For the record,
both our plans failed.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.278
- Yeah.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.804
- I just went in one direction
while you went in the other,

21:23.847 --> 21:26.502
instead of figuring out
a plan together.

21:26.546 --> 21:29.200
- Yeah.

21:29.244 --> 21:32.029
- I should've made that happen.

21:32.073 --> 21:36.425
I should've led the team.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.906
- It's not too late.

21:38.949 --> 21:42.779
Barry chose you for a reason.

21:42.823 --> 21:46.261
Don't doubt yourself, Cisco.

21:48.524 --> 21:52.180
- What?

21:52.223 --> 21:54.095
- Something Ramsey said...

21:54.138 --> 21:57.751
"I knew
I picked the right guy."

21:57.794 --> 22:00.231
Barry said those words.

22:04.845 --> 22:06.760
Barry said
those exact words to me

22:06.803 --> 22:09.763
when he made me team leader.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.896
Ramsey could've infected me.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.290
He could've killed me.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.726
But he didn't--

22:16.770 --> 22:18.989
instead he just did
a complete 180 for no reason.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.211
- There's something else.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.387
Ramsey said, "I'm coming home."

22:25.431 --> 22:27.476
I begged Barry to come home
the last time I saw him,

22:27.520 --> 22:29.565
but I didn't think
that I was getting through.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.828
- Iris...

22:31.872 --> 22:33.482
what if that was Barry?

22:33.526 --> 22:35.092
What if you were right

22:35.136 --> 22:37.443
and he's still alive
inside Dark Flash?

22:37.486 --> 22:39.619
- Then he could be trying
to tell us what to do.

22:39.662 --> 22:40.924
- We gotta take down Bloodwork.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.493
Someone's at the barrier.

22:54.198 --> 22:57.288
- I have arrived
to fulfill my destiny.

22:57.332 --> 23:00.727
And yes, my army is coming.

23:00.770 --> 23:03.686
- Iris...

23:03.730 --> 23:05.949
Cisco...

23:05.993 --> 23:08.561
let the light in.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.915
- I think I just figured out
Barry's plan...

23:14.958 --> 23:16.830
And he just told us
the next step.

23:16.873 --> 23:19.746
- We need
to lower the defenses.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.138
Let them in.

23:27.318 --> 23:31.410
- It's time to put an end
to death once and for all.

23:49.210 --> 23:53.257
- Find the humans who rejected
my lifeblood and kill them.

24:08.969 --> 24:10.579
- You want me to do what?

24:10.623 --> 24:12.363
- Barry's plan is
to let the light in.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.888
It isn't for Ramsey to spread
his infection to the city,

24:14.931 --> 24:18.195
it's for you
to spread the antidote...

24:18.239 --> 24:20.415
with one hell of a UV blast.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.243
- But I can't do that.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.463
- Don't worry, I've done
all the calculations.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.812
We'll walk you through
the whole thing.

24:25.855 --> 24:28.118
Just get to the pipeline now.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.699
- Good evening, Team Flash.

24:43.743 --> 24:45.832
I have tried repeatedly

24:45.875 --> 24:48.617
to bestow upon you
eternal life,

24:48.661 --> 24:50.358
yet you've refused.

24:50.401 --> 24:55.624
So now, instead of continuing
to offer you the gift of life,

24:55.668 --> 24:59.759
I've ordered my Blood Brothers
to take it from you.

24:59.802 --> 25:02.544
Now as you run
for your worthless lives,

25:02.588 --> 25:05.678
do keep in mind
that your leader, Flash,

25:05.721 --> 25:07.288
belongs to me now.

25:07.331 --> 25:12.293
I have his access codes,
his handprint, his knowledge.

25:12.336 --> 25:15.949
My objective will be achieved.

25:47.023 --> 25:48.721
- Bring me Iris and Cisco.

26:02.256 --> 26:05.607
- I want you to know
the scope of your failure.

26:07.696 --> 26:10.264
- My lifeblood
is circling the accelerator.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.661
And when
it gathers enough speed,

26:15.704 --> 26:18.098
it'll collide
with the energy inside

26:18.141 --> 26:22.537
and the resulting collision
will cure this city...

26:22.581 --> 26:24.365
and you.

26:24.408 --> 26:26.410
Barry...

26:28.108 --> 26:29.500
Barry...

26:29.544 --> 26:31.241
I trust you.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.032
- What are you doing?

26:39.075 --> 26:40.033
Kill her.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.566
Barry...

26:56.615 --> 26:58.617
- We are one, you and I.

27:11.151 --> 27:13.109
It's pointless to fight it.

27:13.153 --> 27:16.330
I know you want
to execute my will.

27:16.373 --> 27:19.507
I can feel it inside you,
Flash.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.645
- Much better.

27:45.011 --> 27:46.708
- Get ready to run.

27:46.752 --> 27:47.753
- What are you gonna do?

27:47.796 --> 27:51.757
- What I do.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.326
- Barry?

27:57.850 --> 27:59.329
- We only have
about five rotations left

27:59.373 --> 28:00.591
before collision.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.071
- How long is each rotation?

28:02.115 --> 28:03.725
- A few seconds if we're lucky.

28:11.167 --> 28:12.429
- Allegra,
where the hell are you?

28:12.473 --> 28:14.344
- Right here!

28:16.564 --> 28:17.913
- When I open this door,

28:17.957 --> 28:19.175
you need to hit these particles

28:19.219 --> 28:20.829
with all the UV rays
you've got.

28:44.635 --> 28:46.986
- You got this.
Don't hold back.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.208
- One rotation left!

28:53.340 --> 28:54.297
Now!

29:45.871 --> 29:47.786
- Hey.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.745
Barry.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.661
Barry.

30:01.843 --> 30:02.844
Hey.

30:05.368 --> 30:09.024
- It's me.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.291
- Hey, uh--

30:15.335 --> 30:17.685
where's the scary guy
who tried to kill us all?

30:21.994 --> 30:22.951
- He won't get far.

30:26.955 --> 30:28.000
- I won't be denied!

30:29.653 --> 30:30.654
- Okay, just stay here.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.311
You can't control me anymore.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.879
and I'm not gonna let you
hurt anybody else.

30:40.012 --> 30:42.101
- For the last time...

30:42.144 --> 30:45.669
I am trying to save everyone!

30:45.713 --> 30:47.715
Don't you understand?

30:47.758 --> 30:50.761
You're not the hero here, I am!

31:20.704 --> 31:23.098
- Cisco, you with me?
- Always.

31:23.142 --> 31:25.579
Babel's been lifted,
comms are up.

31:25.622 --> 31:26.972
We are back.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.887
- What do we have
that can hold Ramsey?

31:28.930 --> 31:33.021
- After Mitch Romero, we know
a pipeline cell won't work.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.414
- The M.A.C.

31:34.457 --> 31:36.503
It contained Chester's
black hole energy.

31:36.546 --> 31:38.897
- So Ramsey should be
a walk in the park.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.859
- Flash, you okay?

31:57.654 --> 31:58.960
- Stay down!

32:06.489 --> 32:09.623
Any last words
before your death?

32:09.666 --> 32:13.932
- I just want
to enjoy the time I have left.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.759
- I felt the same way.

32:17.805 --> 32:21.765
My beautiful boy...

32:21.809 --> 32:23.680
Ramsey.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.079
What have you done?

32:34.735 --> 32:37.781
My son...

32:37.825 --> 32:40.219
I've missed you so much.

32:43.439 --> 32:46.094
- Mom?

32:46.138 --> 32:47.530
How is this even possible?

32:47.574 --> 32:49.315
- I brought her.

32:49.358 --> 32:50.925
You entered my mind

32:50.969 --> 32:54.537
to bring out that doubt
that was hidden inside.

32:54.581 --> 32:57.236
I left you infect me
so I could return the favor

32:57.279 --> 32:58.585
and bring out yours.

32:58.628 --> 32:59.803
- Impossible.

32:59.847 --> 33:02.589
I have no doubt.
Only conviction.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.243
- Ramsey.

33:04.286 --> 33:08.856
I would give anything to have
just one more day with my mom.

33:08.899 --> 33:11.119
You have that chance right now.

33:11.163 --> 33:12.991
Listen to her.

33:14.601 --> 33:17.386
- He's right.

33:17.430 --> 33:20.781
You were born to heal.

33:20.824 --> 33:23.566
But you've become
an angel of destruction.

33:23.610 --> 33:24.567
- No.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.613
This isn't happening.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.832
This isn't real.

33:28.876 --> 33:31.009
- My dear son...

33:34.621 --> 33:38.059
You wanted so desperately
to save me.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.279
Now let me save you
from yourself.

33:40.322 --> 33:43.064
- I just wanted
to help them all.

33:52.465 --> 33:54.162
- No!

33:54.206 --> 33:55.294
Perhaps she was wrong.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.774
I was born to save the world!

33:59.820 --> 34:00.951
And I still can.

34:04.433 --> 34:05.869
Can you hear me, Flash?

34:05.913 --> 34:08.437
I was chosen to save the world.

34:08.481 --> 34:13.442
And when I escape these chains,
I will complete my destiny.

34:13.486 --> 34:19.013
And you will all
accept my cure.

34:21.102 --> 34:24.584
- Containment protocol's
holding.

34:24.627 --> 34:25.541
It worked.

34:25.585 --> 34:28.066
- We did it.
We beat him.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.635
- Now it's time
for our next fight.

34:40.643 --> 34:41.731
- Lyla says Ramsey

34:41.775 --> 34:43.994
is officially
in A.R.G.U.S. custody.

34:44.038 --> 34:46.040
- And I called
the local hospitals--

34:46.084 --> 34:47.389
Ramsey's infection doesn't seem

34:47.433 --> 34:49.043
to have
any long-lasting effects.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.914
- So everyone's gonna be okay?

34:50.958 --> 34:52.786
- Everyone except Ramsay.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.135
Frost ran some tests,

34:54.179 --> 34:57.007
and it looks like
his condition is, um...

34:57.051 --> 34:59.097
pretty permanent.

34:59.140 --> 35:00.489
- Joe's resting in the lounge,

35:00.533 --> 35:03.231
and I think
I am gonna go check on him.

35:09.063 --> 35:12.762
What was it like
being Dark Flash?

35:15.548 --> 35:18.246
- I knew what was happening,
but I couldn't stop it.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.422
Honestly,
it took everything I had

35:20.466 --> 35:22.642
just to keep
from hurting you guys.

35:22.685 --> 35:25.253
But as the night went on,
I could tell I was--

35:25.297 --> 35:26.907
I was getting to him.
I could feel him

35:26.950 --> 35:29.779
doubting himself more and more.

35:29.823 --> 35:32.042
Thank you for what you did.

35:32.086 --> 35:33.609
You saved the city.

35:33.653 --> 35:34.610
- Right back at ya.

35:34.654 --> 35:36.612
But you should really
thank Frost.

35:36.656 --> 35:37.961
She got me there.

35:38.005 --> 35:38.962
She's badass.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.268
- Yeah, she is.

35:40.312 --> 35:44.142
- Speaking of,
where is the Ice Queen?

35:45.273 --> 35:48.537
- Caity, I know
the last couple of days

35:48.581 --> 35:50.496
have been a roller-coaster,

35:50.539 --> 35:54.195
but I just wanted to say thanks
for believing in me

35:54.239 --> 35:56.328
even though
I didn't believe in myself.

35:56.371 --> 35:57.764
- No thanks needed.

35:57.807 --> 35:59.809
And for it's worth,
I'm really proud

35:59.853 --> 36:02.464
of how you've grown
these last few months.

36:02.508 --> 36:05.467
I can't wait
to see where you go next.

36:05.511 --> 36:07.295
- Me, too.

36:07.339 --> 36:11.778
But for tonight,
I think you should take over.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.649
It's only right
that you're with the team

36:13.693 --> 36:17.087
for whatever Crisis
is about to bring.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.025
- Guys?

36:42.069 --> 36:44.332
Sitting in silence really
isn't how I want to spend

36:44.376 --> 36:45.681
the next few minutes.

36:51.774 --> 36:55.387
Joe...

36:55.430 --> 36:59.042
when you gave me your watch,
that meant...

36:59.086 --> 37:02.437
that meant the world to me.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.657
I wanna give you mine.

37:04.700 --> 37:10.228
So I know wherever I go,
part of me is with you.

37:10.271 --> 37:13.143
- I love you for that.

37:13.187 --> 37:16.016
But you're not
going anywhere yet.

37:16.059 --> 37:19.062
So you hold on to it.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.586
- All right.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.548
- H.R. Wells told me once...

37:26.592 --> 37:31.336
"Barry Allen's superpower
isn't speed.

37:31.379 --> 37:33.599
"It's hope.

37:33.642 --> 37:40.345
It's hope, and that kid has
an endless reservoir of it."

37:40.388 --> 37:41.911
I didn't know how right he was

37:41.955 --> 37:45.872
until I really got
to know you, Barry.

37:45.915 --> 37:49.963
Whatever is about to happen,

37:50.006 --> 37:53.358
this world's a better place
for having you in it.

37:53.401 --> 37:55.316
- You know, when you
first came into my life,

37:55.360 --> 37:59.146
I had lost faith
in just about everything.

38:00.974 --> 38:03.019
You saved my life, Barry.

38:05.544 --> 38:07.197
- God, I remember
the old days.

38:08.808 --> 38:14.292
- No doppelgangers,
no Flashpoint, no time travel.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.772
It was just us
against the bad guys.

38:18.861 --> 38:20.080
I miss that.

38:20.123 --> 38:22.865
- I don't know,
I kinda like time travel.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.519
When you were stuck
in the Speed Force,

38:24.563 --> 38:26.608
I would have Cisco
vibe me to the Waterfront

38:26.652 --> 38:29.219
so I could watch
our first kiss.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.439
You know, the one you had
to erase from the timeline

38:31.483 --> 38:32.832
to save the world.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.225
- Why'd you do that?

38:35.269 --> 38:36.618
- I don't know.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.098
I guess when you're filled
with sadness,

38:38.141 --> 38:41.710
happy thoughts are what
get you through the day.

38:43.495 --> 38:46.672
And what's happier than getting
half your first kiss

38:46.715 --> 38:48.195
with the love of your life

38:48.238 --> 38:50.937
other than getting
to do it twice?

38:59.815 --> 39:02.122
Our love story never ends,
Barry.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.819
Not even with Crisis.

39:03.863 --> 39:07.823
- Iris, it's inevitable.

39:07.867 --> 39:10.435
- Maybe.

39:10.478 --> 39:15.788
But whether you vanish or...

39:15.831 --> 39:19.705
or worse, I am gonna
be there with you.

39:19.748 --> 39:23.491
I'm gonna be right there
with you to the very end, okay?

39:23.535 --> 39:27.669
Because the only thing
more inevitable than Crisis

39:27.713 --> 39:29.236
is us.

39:32.935 --> 39:36.156
- Iris is right.

39:36.199 --> 39:37.592
Whatever's in store for us,

39:37.636 --> 39:39.942
they can't change what we mean
to each other.

39:41.727 --> 39:44.686
Can't erase
what's in our hearts.

39:44.730 --> 39:49.822
As long as we hold on
to that...

39:49.865 --> 39:55.088
we've beaten Crisis
before it even begins.

40:31.603 --> 40:38.044
- For so many years,
I've traveled across worlds,

40:38.087 --> 40:41.264
across the multiverse,
to do one thing.

40:41.308 --> 40:43.615
Kill you.

40:43.658 --> 40:46.531
And now here...

40:46.574 --> 40:48.097
you saved my life.

40:48.141 --> 40:53.320
- Submit
and begin your life anew.

40:53.363 --> 40:54.582
- Show me.

40:54.626 --> 40:59.065
- The knowledge is within you.

42:12.573 --> 42:14.053
- Greg, move your head.
