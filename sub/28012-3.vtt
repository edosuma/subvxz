WEBVTT

00:01.106 --> 00:03.787
<i>Previously on</i> Proven Innocent...

00:04.070 --> 00:05.546
<i>What are you doing, Maddie?</i>

00:05.583 --> 00:07.743
<i>I need to figure out
what really happened to Rosemary.</i>

00:07.841 --> 00:09.460
You sure you really want to do this?

00:09.516 --> 00:10.976
Ever since I saw Bellows,

00:11.023 --> 00:12.265
<i>it triggered something in me.</i>

00:12.302 --> 00:14.191
I was just doing my job,
and I honestly thought

00:14.228 --> 00:16.111
you were guilty. In fact, I still do.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.741
I announce my candidacy
for attorney general

00:18.802 --> 00:20.501
to the great state of Illinois.

00:20.596 --> 00:22.003
I got a line on Madeline Scott.

00:22.121 --> 00:24.172
- Bring me something good.
- You know I will.

00:24.290 --> 00:25.657
You think that I killed Rosemary?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.175
I don't know what to think anymore.

00:27.269 --> 00:29.510
I told myself I wouldn't come
until I found your killer.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.590
I swear to you I'll find them.

00:34.416 --> 00:35.582
<i>The moment I was accused</i>

00:35.619 --> 00:37.158
<i>of Rosemary Lynch's murder,</i>

00:37.195 --> 00:39.848
<i>the world saw me as a different person.</i>

00:40.228 --> 00:42.820
<i>I wasn't Madeline Scott
anymore. I was someone else.</i>

00:46.009 --> 00:47.973
<i>I was the party girl,</i>

00:48.010 --> 00:50.351
<i>the sex maniac, a killer.</i>

00:52.767 --> 00:53.832
Hi.

00:53.869 --> 00:55.197
<i>I was also the innocent victim.</i>

00:55.234 --> 00:56.236
- Thanks.
- Hi.

00:56.273 --> 00:59.237
<i>The wrongly accused,
the girl in trouble.</i>

01:05.396 --> 01:08.789
<i>But however they saw me,
inside I felt the same.</i>

01:09.200 --> 01:11.974
<i>Eventually, the inside changed, too.</i>

01:12.445 --> 01:14.958
<i>When you live day to day
behind prison bars,</i>

01:15.064 --> 01:17.415
<i>you begin to forget who you are.</i>

01:18.958 --> 01:21.700
<i>You lose yourself.</i>

01:22.349 --> 01:26.089
One day, you realize
you've become something else.

01:26.536 --> 01:29.685
Well, the Madeline Scott
that I know and love,

01:29.722 --> 01:32.856
she's fierce,
inside the courtroom and out.

01:33.857 --> 01:36.984
Every wrongfully accused person
faces the same challenge.

01:37.078 --> 01:40.146
How do we stop letting others
define who we are?

01:40.347 --> 01:41.583
<i>Thank you, Pastor,</i>

01:41.620 --> 01:43.177
for that lovely sermon.

01:43.255 --> 01:45.159
It was very inspirational.

01:45.196 --> 01:47.130
For some more than others.

01:47.193 --> 01:49.130
Michael's in a world
of his own sometimes.

01:49.205 --> 01:52.091
The boy is 14 years old.
We both know what that means.

01:52.128 --> 01:54.185
Ezekiel,

01:54.222 --> 01:56.172
can I have a private word with you?

01:58.279 --> 01:59.911
How old was William in this picture?

01:59.948 --> 02:01.377
He'd just turned 14.

02:01.414 --> 02:04.019
- Same age as your boy.
- You don't say.

02:04.056 --> 02:06.706
William is 19 now, a gifted young man

02:06.743 --> 02:08.509
and still a person of faith.

02:08.547 --> 02:10.894
When Patricia joined the church
a few months back,

02:10.946 --> 02:12.111
I started to visit him.

02:12.148 --> 02:14.275
The pastor has been a godsend.

02:14.428 --> 02:17.320
I-I still can't believe
any of this is real.

02:17.417 --> 02:19.297
Two days after that picture was taken,

02:19.334 --> 02:20.836
William was arrested for murder.

02:20.968 --> 02:22.609
They locked him up for life.

02:22.707 --> 02:25.533
Tried him as an adult
because he looked like an adult.

02:25.570 --> 02:27.061
It happens all the time.

02:27.219 --> 02:29.055
When a judge sees
what he thinks is a man

02:29.092 --> 02:30.692
in his courtroom,
he treats him like one.

02:30.748 --> 02:33.591
My nephew didn't shoot
any liquor store owner.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.372
William has been suffering
in prison for five years.

02:36.467 --> 02:38.815
He's lost all hope, Ezekiel.

02:38.945 --> 02:40.608
We need you.

02:42.488 --> 02:45.022
Why don't you start by telling
me how all this happened.

02:45.139 --> 02:47.325
Well, that's the crazy part.

02:47.482 --> 02:49.774
William confessed.

02:56.420 --> 02:58.120
So...

02:58.566 --> 03:00.837
the police asked for your help.

03:04.056 --> 03:05.470
And you had the gun that killed

03:05.507 --> 03:07.341
the liquor store owner in your bedroom?

03:08.873 --> 03:10.503
Rabbit gave it to me.

03:11.074 --> 03:13.709
Rabbit. Does he have a last name?

03:18.550 --> 03:20.813
He looks like this, though.

03:24.768 --> 03:26.841
This is incredible.

03:32.944 --> 03:34.944
These are amazing.

03:37.334 --> 03:39.283
He's called Soul Brother.

03:39.459 --> 03:41.186
It's about an archangel
who saves humanity

03:41.223 --> 03:42.506
but still can't get a cab.

03:45.774 --> 03:47.665
Yeah, I feel that.

03:48.045 --> 03:50.251
So, did you tell the police
about Rabbit?

03:55.037 --> 03:57.085
They said I made him up.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.631
They said lots of stuff,

03:58.668 --> 04:00.444
But none of it's true.

04:00.481 --> 04:02.201
I don't know what you want me to say.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.273
How about starting with the truth?

04:07.380 --> 04:09.806
Pastor White said you get people
out of jail.

04:10.111 --> 04:11.585
We both do.

04:12.147 --> 04:14.466
We don't always win,
but we do our best.

04:14.858 --> 04:16.945
You'll do God's will.

04:17.307 --> 04:19.437
And that will be good enough.

04:24.201 --> 04:26.213
We'll do our best for you, William.

04:44.193 --> 04:46.138
William got railroaded.

04:46.208 --> 04:49.161
We need to take this case apart
piece by piece,

04:49.198 --> 04:51.007
starting with the confession.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.161
He was only 14 years old,

04:53.198 --> 04:54.745
and the police questioned him
for 20 hours.

04:54.769 --> 04:56.326
Where was his aunt during all of this?

04:56.363 --> 04:58.732
Working three jobs.
She consented to an interview

04:58.769 --> 05:00.292
that became an interrogation.

05:00.356 --> 05:01.880
She didn't even know he was a suspect.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.149
So no lawyers.

05:03.186 --> 05:05.099
And no physical evidence
of him at the scene,

05:05.136 --> 05:06.787
and no testimony putting him there.

05:06.826 --> 05:08.599
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Huge problem, though.

05:08.623 --> 05:10.235
The murder weapon was found
in his bedroom.

05:10.259 --> 05:13.396
Given to him by a guy called Rabbit.

05:13.485 --> 05:15.559
Now, William only turned
the gun over to the police

05:15.596 --> 05:17.645
because he thought he was helping them.

05:17.682 --> 05:20.006
We need to find grounds
to get this back in court.

05:20.068 --> 05:22.373
Well, we should eviscerate
defense counsel.

05:22.467 --> 05:24.891
William's murder trial
lasted only one day.

05:25.046 --> 05:27.047
I've had dental work
that lasted longer than that.

05:27.566 --> 05:29.733
Jury deliberation took four days.

05:29.921 --> 05:31.161
Must have been a holdout.

05:31.255 --> 05:32.755
We need to track down that jury.

05:33.570 --> 05:35.078
Vi?

05:36.171 --> 05:38.374
Not Radcliff the Madcliff.

05:38.483 --> 05:41.187
- Is that a person?
- He's the jury administrator.

05:41.224 --> 05:42.880
He's been asking me out for six months.

05:43.008 --> 05:45.289
So what's the problem? You're on
dating apps all the time.

05:45.316 --> 05:46.776
There are many problems with Radcliff.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.226
He has 50 birds, for starters.

05:49.263 --> 05:52.525
Violet... it's only one date.

05:52.693 --> 05:55.935
It's the fastest way to find out
who the holdout juror is.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.122
Fine.

05:58.231 --> 06:00.214
But you people owe me.

06:02.177 --> 06:04.685
Hey, Radcliff, it's Violet.

06:04.722 --> 06:06.684
- About that date.
<i>- Really?</i>

06:06.789 --> 06:08.914
I just need a little favor.

06:09.242 --> 06:11.698
I was the holdout on the jury.

06:11.786 --> 06:13.971
William seemed like a good kid.

06:14.044 --> 06:16.725
There was something sweet about him.

06:16.911 --> 06:19.007
He was scared. Overwhelmed.

06:19.177 --> 06:20.794
What made you change your mind?

06:20.895 --> 06:23.286
The foreman would bring in
the newspaper every day.

06:23.323 --> 06:26.348
They were running a series
on the man he shot,

06:26.385 --> 06:28.237
Wan Lee Kim.

06:28.559 --> 06:30.106
It was awful.

06:30.143 --> 06:31.473
Did this influence your vote?

06:31.510 --> 06:32.726
Absolutely.

06:32.888 --> 06:36.046
After I read it, I voted to convict.

06:36.427 --> 06:37.755
Thank you.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.810
Your Honor, this is clearly
jury misconduct.

06:39.879 --> 06:41.162
Indeed.

06:41.209 --> 06:44.904
I hereby find reversible error
in the original trial.

06:44.941 --> 06:46.969
Mr. Hurston is granted a new trial.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.273
Let's get it right this time.

06:50.931 --> 06:52.405
We're just getting started.

06:52.442 --> 06:54.750
This is a step in the right direction.

06:55.455 --> 06:57.997
If you say so, Mr. Boudreau.

06:58.995 --> 07:01.967
I can't believe I agreed
to go out with Radcliff.

07:02.529 --> 07:04.672
- Did I mention birds?
- Hey, who knows...

07:04.709 --> 07:05.989
you may discover you love birds.

07:06.013 --> 07:08.179
Or get avian flu.

07:10.023 --> 07:13.079
Maybe I should date question mark guy.

07:13.539 --> 07:15.663
He is such a hottie.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.851
- Who is he?
- Jim something.

07:18.888 --> 07:21.179
Rosemary dated him
the summer before she died.

07:21.984 --> 07:25.043
I broke up with Jim,
and he showed up at Stanford,

07:25.080 --> 07:26.246
like a stalker.

07:26.283 --> 07:28.631
It was so creepy.

07:29.481 --> 07:30.839
It ended badly.

07:30.876 --> 07:33.534
Well, it seems like he should've
been the main suspect.

07:33.594 --> 07:35.446
Why didn't anybody find him?

07:35.535 --> 07:37.441
Oh, my original lawyer
searched every town

07:37.478 --> 07:38.781
within a hundred miles.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.378
Maybe we should try again.

07:40.472 --> 07:43.776
No, I don't have a last name,
description.

07:44.394 --> 07:45.706
Nothing.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.238
I bet I can dig something up.

07:47.316 --> 07:49.156
Yeah, have at it.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.207
You looking for this?

08:00.019 --> 08:03.129
Carlos Rafael Gomez, aged 22.

08:03.247 --> 08:05.210
His face looks just like yours.

08:05.308 --> 08:06.794
Where'd you get this?

08:06.902 --> 08:08.785
Jared knows this guy.

08:08.830 --> 08:09.845
Do you know how much trouble

08:09.869 --> 08:11.182
you'd get into if you got caught?

08:11.206 --> 08:13.179
You get arrested,
thrown into the system,

08:13.216 --> 08:15.598
life as you know it would be over.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.311
- I-I didn't even...
- You don't get it, do you?

08:18.542 --> 08:20.340
You're a black boy living in Chicago.

08:20.377 --> 08:23.097
You got a target on your back
the moment you leave this house.

08:23.175 --> 08:25.003
So now you're officially grounded.

08:25.099 --> 08:27.300
What? For how long?

08:27.337 --> 08:29.966
You can't see that far into the future.

08:39.376 --> 08:40.869
<i>Hey, maybe this Rabbit will just</i>

08:40.905 --> 08:42.962
hop out of his hole and just confess.

08:42.999 --> 08:44.406
We got to find him first.

08:44.443 --> 08:45.534
Yeah, we're trying.

08:45.571 --> 08:47.283
Meantime, we could go after
the detectives

08:47.320 --> 08:48.655
who coerced William's confession.

08:48.692 --> 08:51.830
The arresting officer
is a Detective Joe Folino.

08:51.898 --> 08:53.815
- Damn it.
- Crap.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.079
Am I missing something?

08:55.119 --> 08:57.099
He's a jerk, but juries love him.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.723
What the hell?

09:08.711 --> 09:10.029
What are you doing here?

09:10.066 --> 09:11.328
Hello, Madeline.

09:11.383 --> 09:13.718
Just couldn't pass up a chance
to dance with you again.

09:13.755 --> 09:16.222
Should be fun. I'll lead.

09:25.727 --> 09:27.352
The kid confessed.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.216
Detective Folino, do people sometimes

09:30.253 --> 09:32.680
falsely confess to crimes
they did not commit?

09:32.717 --> 09:36.089
Sure. And some people fake it
in the sack, too,

09:36.126 --> 09:37.584
but, uh, I've been doing it long enough

09:37.608 --> 09:39.558
to know the difference.

09:39.677 --> 09:41.339
So you have no concerns?

09:41.376 --> 09:43.913
I have zero concerns
about this confession.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.633
Zero. He's the killer.

09:45.791 --> 09:47.410
Nothing further.

09:49.405 --> 09:51.116
Confessions are typically confirmed

09:51.153 --> 09:53.523
using a written statement
or a videotape.

09:53.905 --> 09:55.464
Why wasn't that done for William?

09:55.538 --> 09:58.429
I videotaped him,
but the file got corrupted.

09:58.466 --> 10:00.524
So you have no proof of a confession?

10:00.561 --> 10:03.153
The defendant led me straight
to the murder weapon,

10:03.418 --> 10:04.940
hidden in his bedroom.

10:05.015 --> 10:06.977
Now, when you questioned
William, he told you who

10:07.004 --> 10:08.256
- gave him that gun, didn't he?
- Yeah.

10:08.280 --> 10:10.038
- He said it was a rabbit.
- Uh, he said

10:10.075 --> 10:11.359
it was someone nicknamed Rabbit.

10:11.406 --> 10:12.708
Yeah, but I don't know no Rabbit,

10:12.732 --> 10:14.390
so obviously, the defendant was lying.

10:14.427 --> 10:16.402
No. You were lying, weren't you?

10:16.584 --> 10:19.385
You told him you needed his help
finding the real killer.

10:19.422 --> 10:21.313
You never told him he was a suspect.

10:21.428 --> 10:24.404
How does it feel deceiving
a 14-year-old boy?

10:24.441 --> 10:26.311
Objection. Counsel is badgering.

10:26.348 --> 10:29.235
Sustained. Are we about done,
Mr. Boudreau?

10:29.272 --> 10:30.780
Yes, Your Honor.

10:33.881 --> 10:35.334
We should put William on the stand.

10:35.371 --> 10:38.146
No. I'm not exposing him to Bellows.

10:38.295 --> 10:41.490
He'll force William to admit to
his confession, and we'll lose.

10:41.527 --> 10:43.060
No dice on the wascally wabbit.

10:43.097 --> 10:44.350
I canvassed the whole neighborhood,

10:44.374 --> 10:46.349
and no one's heard of him
or they're not talking.

10:46.386 --> 10:47.913
Well, he's got to be somewhere.

10:48.026 --> 10:49.767
William didn't just make him up.

10:49.862 --> 10:51.037
Find him.

10:51.074 --> 10:52.534
Yeah, man.
That's what I'm trying to do.

10:52.558 --> 10:53.752
We will find him.

10:53.789 --> 10:56.654
But first, we need to verify
William's alibi.

10:56.754 --> 10:58.787
This photo was taken on the day
of the murder.

10:58.899 --> 11:00.734
If we can establish a time of day...

11:00.771 --> 11:02.020
Let me see that.

11:04.335 --> 11:06.132
That's Brainiac Comics on Damen Avenue.

11:06.169 --> 11:07.218
They're open 10:00 to 4:00,

11:07.242 --> 11:08.534
except for Wednesdays and Saturdays,

11:08.558 --> 11:10.408
which is new comic release day.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.716
Closet geek.

11:12.761 --> 11:15.820
- But too good for the bird guy?
- Comic books are not birds.

11:15.857 --> 11:17.249
Great!

11:18.039 --> 11:19.713
Track down the owner.

11:25.458 --> 11:27.148
What's up with Boudreau?

11:27.731 --> 11:29.450
Why is he so cranky?

11:30.005 --> 11:31.895
Doesn't want to let down William.

11:32.035 --> 11:33.726
Or his church.

11:40.942 --> 11:43.305
Hey! I just reached the next circuit.

11:43.342 --> 11:45.166
And you just reached my last nerve.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.949
Grounded means no video games.

11:46.996 --> 11:48.324
Yeah, whatever.

11:48.426 --> 11:50.642
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

11:50.748 --> 11:52.990
Oh, you think you a man now?

11:53.449 --> 11:56.715
Fake IDs, impressing
your friends buying beers.

11:56.754 --> 11:59.180
- You know, when I was your age...
- I know, I know.

11:59.242 --> 12:00.981
You got in trouble, got beat up,

12:01.018 --> 12:03.270
but then you found God.
Look, I'm not you.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.187
Hey, you ain't gonna be
disrespecting me, homey.

12:05.264 --> 12:06.712
Now, this is my house.

12:06.770 --> 12:09.168
You do as I say,
or you can get the hell out.

12:09.246 --> 12:11.126
That's fine with me.

12:28.340 --> 12:29.926
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

12:29.963 --> 12:31.674
So, um... so, tell me something.

12:31.711 --> 12:34.363
How's the, uh... how's the trial going?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.100
- Awful.
- Yeah?

12:36.434 --> 12:38.848
Every time I see Bellows,
I want to jam my pen in his eye.

12:38.885 --> 12:39.957
Oh, God.

12:41.654 --> 12:43.896
Sorry, I know you were
just asking to be polite.

12:43.969 --> 12:45.473
It's okay.

12:45.838 --> 12:48.156
The truth is refreshing
when you're dating someone.

12:51.762 --> 12:53.085
We're dating?

12:53.122 --> 12:55.613
Well, you know,
we're out on a date, so yeah.

12:55.754 --> 12:57.697
OKAY, NOTE TO SELF: she doesn't
like the word "dating."

12:57.721 --> 13:00.072
No, no, it's...

13:01.254 --> 13:03.652
It's not that, I just, um...

13:04.770 --> 13:06.323
I never learned how to do this.

13:06.371 --> 13:08.473
I didn't get to go to college
and fumble around

13:08.510 --> 13:10.020
like everyone else.

13:10.194 --> 13:13.793
You've been out for what...
been out... six years?

13:15.050 --> 13:17.051
There's more to you,
there's more to your identity

13:17.088 --> 13:18.696
than just prison.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.804
There is, huh?

13:22.097 --> 13:23.533
And what would that be?

13:23.570 --> 13:25.160
I don't know.

13:25.934 --> 13:27.410
But I'm hoping to find out.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.121
Dance?

13:36.744 --> 13:38.590
Or don't you dance, either?

14:13.262 --> 14:14.912
I should go.

14:32.395 --> 14:34.443
- -Thank you all
so much for coming out today.

14:34.519 --> 14:37.428
I'm Madeline Scott, and it is my...

14:37.883 --> 14:40.434
Thank you. Thank you.

14:40.576 --> 14:43.511
And it is my privilege and my honor

14:43.531 --> 14:47.599
to announce the candidacy
and my wholehearted support

14:47.636 --> 14:49.854
of Evan Esteban-Miller

14:49.891 --> 14:51.757
for the attorney general of Illinois!

14:53.943 --> 14:56.099
Unlike his opponent, Gore Bellows,

14:56.240 --> 14:58.802
Evan is a talented, fair-minded,

14:58.857 --> 15:01.213
successful trial lawyer.

15:01.331 --> 15:02.583
<i>Gore Bellows' prosecutions</i>

15:02.620 --> 15:04.444
<i>are corrupt, and he has...</i>

15:05.029 --> 15:07.544
I expect you to stab me in the
back, Susan, but in the front?

15:07.581 --> 15:09.076
Oh, grow up, Gore.

15:09.133 --> 15:10.964
I had her on the show
because she gets ratings.

15:10.988 --> 15:13.541
Not news. She's only
doing it to get to me.

15:13.602 --> 15:14.857
Well, hell hath no fury

15:14.894 --> 15:17.099
like a woman wrongfully
imprisoned for a decade.

15:17.136 --> 15:18.472
You don't know the evidence.

15:18.755 --> 15:19.813
<i>She and her brother</i>

15:19.850 --> 15:21.792
killed that girl,
and now they're both free.

15:22.292 --> 15:23.888
So, what do you want?

15:24.021 --> 15:25.685
Besides the pleasure of your company?

15:25.740 --> 15:28.844
- Oh, my. Are we flirting?
- Is it working?

15:28.907 --> 15:30.909
The charm thing does not work on me.

15:30.986 --> 15:32.260
Now, tell me what you want

15:32.297 --> 15:34.605
and, more significantly,
how it benefits me.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.961
Equal time, and...

15:37.020 --> 15:38.572
the Marquez trial's coming up.

15:38.609 --> 15:40.228
I'll give you exclusive access.

15:40.355 --> 15:42.595
You'll still have to respond
to Madeline Scott's attacks.

15:42.626 --> 15:43.997
No Madeline, no airtime.

15:44.115 --> 15:46.131
It just so happens I have
an idea that will bring me

15:46.155 --> 15:48.018
in direct conflict with Madeline Scott.

15:48.095 --> 15:50.314
Are you talking about
the liquor store murder trial?

15:50.395 --> 15:51.888
It's good,
but you're gonna have to do better

15:51.912 --> 15:52.830
than that for my show.

15:52.867 --> 15:54.895
Rosemary Lynch's parents.

15:55.231 --> 15:57.668
I'm gonna use them in a new
campaign for victims' rights.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.174
Once they're
front and center with me...

15:59.198 --> 16:02.333
- I can bring up Madeline Scott.
- And remind your audience

16:02.370 --> 16:03.955
that the only reason she's famous

16:04.169 --> 16:06.164
is because she murdered
an innocent girl.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.991
That's hot.

16:13.779 --> 16:15.954
<i>State of Illinois v. Levi Scott.</i>

16:16.114 --> 16:17.289
Mr. Scott,

16:17.326 --> 16:18.985
- you finally joined us.
- Your Honor,

16:19.022 --> 16:20.344
my client consents

16:20.381 --> 16:22.365
to the plea arrangement agreed
upon with the prosecution.

16:22.389 --> 16:24.484
- The plea is off the table.
- What?

16:24.521 --> 16:27.090
Mr. Duncan, I am not fond
of these kinds of maneuvers.

16:27.218 --> 16:29.715
I'm aware, Your Honor,
but new evidence has surfaced.

16:29.810 --> 16:32.252
A sworn affidavit
from the complaining witness,

16:32.289 --> 16:33.789
Heather Husband.

16:33.866 --> 16:35.328
She asserts that the defendant

16:35.365 --> 16:37.534
took a swing at them
with a baseball bat.

16:38.943 --> 16:41.038
- No, Brian came at me.
- Mr. Scott.

16:41.075 --> 16:42.795
- Levi.
- We're amending our complaint

16:42.832 --> 16:44.256
to assault with a deadly weapon.

16:44.375 --> 16:46.570
In light of Mr. Scott's
prior drug arrests,

16:46.607 --> 16:49.332
we will be seeking the
maximum of 25 years in prison.

16:49.422 --> 16:52.322
Your Honor, this is outrageous.
The State's amended complaint

16:52.359 --> 16:54.051
creates new facts out of thin air.

16:54.482 --> 16:56.398
You can dispute those facts
at the trial.

16:56.435 --> 16:58.575
We're moving forward. Next case.

16:58.669 --> 17:01.497
Maddie, I can't go to prison.
I can't. I will die in there.

17:01.590 --> 17:03.020
What happens if we go to prison?

17:03.065 --> 17:05.332
Okay? I can't do it! I can't!

17:07.252 --> 17:09.694
<i>State of Illinois v. Conway.</i>

17:09.934 --> 17:11.568
You're a lying bitch.

17:11.817 --> 17:13.092
Great defense.

17:13.167 --> 17:15.403
Did they teach you that
in law school or in prison?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.535
Good one, babe.

17:27.042 --> 17:29.113
Hurston, up against the wall. Now.

17:30.229 --> 17:33.426
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't touch my drawings!

17:33.463 --> 17:34.785
This all looks like contraband.

17:34.822 --> 17:36.446
We're gonna have to confiscate this.

17:36.581 --> 17:38.176
It's all I got!

17:38.322 --> 17:40.288
Get off me!

17:49.661 --> 17:51.942
<i>A search of inmate
Hurston's cell uncovered</i>

17:51.969 --> 17:53.840
some hand-drawn artwork.

17:53.950 --> 17:56.981
The images are violent, alarming.

17:57.207 --> 17:59.212
What do the drawings of William Hurston

17:59.249 --> 18:00.734
reveal about his psyche?

18:00.801 --> 18:02.066
<i>Well, as you can see,</i>

18:02.103 --> 18:04.317
<i>he's obsessively drawn the same event</i>

18:04.354 --> 18:06.664
<i>- over and over again.
- No, no!</i>

18:06.957 --> 18:08.550
Is that an admission of guilt?

18:08.587 --> 18:10.866
Objection. Calls for speculation.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.051
Dr. Gregson is not
just the prison warden.

18:13.088 --> 18:16.663
He is also an expert in
forensic evaluation of inmates.

18:16.958 --> 18:19.689
He is here to provide
his expert opinion.

18:19.726 --> 18:21.887
Overruled. Go ahead, Dr. Gregson.

18:21.935 --> 18:25.458
A compulsion to reenact a crime
is a way of dealing with guilt.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.347
To a reasonable degree
of medical certainty,

18:27.384 --> 18:29.814
these drawings are tantamount
to another confession

18:29.851 --> 18:31.460
to killing Mr. Kim.

18:31.667 --> 18:33.500
Nothing further.

18:34.411 --> 18:37.060
Isn't it also reasonable
to assume that these drawings

18:37.097 --> 18:39.314
are a product of William's imagination?

18:39.411 --> 18:41.444
The level of detail suggests otherwise.

18:41.481 --> 18:42.531
Really?

18:42.575 --> 18:45.364
Because in this drawing,
William is holding

18:45.401 --> 18:48.042
a sharp Afro pick
that looks about two feet long.

18:48.079 --> 18:51.323
And in this drawing, he has wings.

18:51.503 --> 18:54.425
So, are you saying
that William had wings

18:54.462 --> 18:57.412
and carried an Afro pick when he
allegedly committed this crime?

18:57.503 --> 18:59.509
- Of course not.
- William has spent

18:59.792 --> 19:02.116
five years in prison.

19:02.163 --> 19:04.295
Isn't it possible that he thinks daily

19:04.332 --> 19:06.006
about the charges that put him there,

19:06.043 --> 19:09.253
and that all this is just an
exploration of that injustice?

19:09.290 --> 19:10.673
I suppose it's possible, but...

19:10.710 --> 19:12.798
And so wouldn't that
actually make these drawings

19:12.835 --> 19:14.633
the opposite of a confession?

19:14.751 --> 19:16.170
Objection. Argumentative.

19:16.207 --> 19:18.538
Withdrawn. Nothing further.

19:24.818 --> 19:26.381
Yo, Rabbit. I'm...

19:29.108 --> 19:30.526
I'm not a cop!

19:40.056 --> 19:42.241
Rabbit! I'm not a cop.

20:10.618 --> 20:12.249
I'm sorry, man. I just...

20:12.485 --> 20:13.917
I can't run anymore.

20:14.791 --> 20:17.212
I'm not here to arrest you.
I'm not a cop, Rabbit.

20:17.399 --> 20:18.449
Rabbit?

20:18.486 --> 20:20.497
Sorry, I-I don't know your real name.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.895
Rabbit was my brother.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.781
He got shot in Fuller Park.

20:24.881 --> 20:26.506
He died a year ago.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.394
Mr. and Mrs. Lynch,
I can't tell you how much

20:34.431 --> 20:37.576
I appreciate you coming down
here on this important issue.

20:37.927 --> 20:39.867
So you want to create a new law

20:39.945 --> 20:42.092
- for victims' rights?
- Exactly.

20:42.154 --> 20:44.324
We intend to introduce legislation

20:44.361 --> 20:45.849
that makes it more difficult

20:45.886 --> 20:49.370
for guilty people like Madeline
and Levi Scott to be exonerated.

20:49.446 --> 20:53.240
I was told you had new evidence
in Rosemary's investigation.

20:53.304 --> 20:56.224
Well, no new evidence, per se,

20:56.396 --> 20:58.990
but we want to apply
the same rigors to her case.

20:59.027 --> 21:01.416
So we're just here for you to use us

21:01.453 --> 21:03.240
to score political points?

21:04.154 --> 21:05.744
Thank you...

21:05.792 --> 21:07.482
- but no, thank you.
- Mr. Lynch,

21:07.519 --> 21:09.107
you don't need to...

21:09.373 --> 21:11.833
Charles and I divorced
several years ago.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.365
Please continue.

21:15.193 --> 21:18.763
It is my hope to name
the bill after your daughter

21:18.807 --> 21:21.427
and that you will help advocate
for its passage.

21:21.580 --> 21:24.766
I want the world to remember
the name Rosemary Lynch.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.415
I'll do anything I can to help you.

21:27.717 --> 21:31.638
You might not want to attack
Madeline and Levi directly.

21:31.717 --> 21:33.588
Charles thinks they're innocent,

21:33.665 --> 21:35.498
and he might oppose the bill if you do.

21:35.638 --> 21:37.482
What do you think, Mrs. Lynch?

21:37.553 --> 21:39.779
I think they're guilty as hell.

21:49.639 --> 21:51.479
Hey, I just jaywalked.
Are you gonna arrest me?

21:51.974 --> 21:53.599
What do you want, Bodie?

21:53.701 --> 21:55.535
Dinner, foreplay.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.782
Not necessarily in that order.

22:00.134 --> 22:01.271
Yeah?

22:05.472 --> 22:07.092
What's for dinner?

22:07.278 --> 22:08.709
Coq au vin.

22:08.746 --> 22:10.380
- Your place?
- Your place.

22:10.589 --> 22:11.823
I'll bring the merlot.

22:11.928 --> 22:14.052
Yeah, and the handcuffs.

22:14.206 --> 22:15.638
I always do.

22:15.735 --> 22:18.114
Yeah, you do.

22:18.271 --> 22:21.536
Now, before this, uh, bacchanal begins,

22:22.341 --> 22:23.775
I need a little favor.

22:24.294 --> 22:26.324
Can you help me find a Rabbit?

22:27.067 --> 22:28.809
Is that a sex thing?

22:29.083 --> 22:31.474
No, it's the name of a guy.

22:31.647 --> 22:32.920
I need his file.

22:32.957 --> 22:34.640
He died a year ago in Fuller Park.

22:34.677 --> 22:36.510
Well, if I do, you got to be my rabbit.

22:37.044 --> 22:38.745
Oh, that's definitely a sex thing.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.942
Hey, how are you doing
on Madeline Scott?

22:50.450 --> 22:53.419
Joe, you know, I'm still...
I'm still thinking on that one.

22:53.520 --> 22:56.003
Think faster.
This thing's starting to drag.

22:56.865 --> 22:58.534
If you can get her to
admit she had something

22:58.558 --> 23:00.205
to do with Rosemary Lynch's death,

23:00.242 --> 23:02.208
you'll get your pick of assignments.

23:04.009 --> 23:06.224
- London?
- Hey, wherever you want.

23:06.279 --> 23:08.279
But it's got to be good.

23:10.692 --> 23:13.009
Hey, I found out more
about our dead Rabbit.

23:13.046 --> 23:14.953
His real name is Derrick Johnston.

23:15.325 --> 23:16.863
And looking at his arrest record,

23:16.947 --> 23:18.504
I definitely think he's the shooter.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.888
Burglary, assault.

23:20.997 --> 23:22.490
The police must have never
even looked at him

23:22.514 --> 23:24.685
- for the liquor store murder.
- Of course not.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.427
How did you get the police report?

23:26.528 --> 23:29.271
Don't worry about it.
But wait, there's more...

23:29.380 --> 23:31.285
if you look at the name
of the arresting officer

23:31.346 --> 23:33.372
on the assault charge.

23:36.754 --> 23:37.906
Radcliff.

23:38.069 --> 23:39.544
Hi, Violet.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.277
Hey, you ready for our lunch?

23:46.711 --> 23:49.303
I-I brought along Curveball

23:49.489 --> 23:50.804
so you can meet him.

23:50.896 --> 23:52.064
Oh, you brought a bird.

23:52.101 --> 23:54.008
That's really adorable.

23:54.294 --> 23:56.185
Uh, does Curveball like baseball?

23:56.380 --> 23:59.071
No, I-I named him
after the double agent

23:59.190 --> 24:01.505
that lied to us during the Iraq War.

24:02.036 --> 24:03.575
His sister's Rumsfeld.

24:06.185 --> 24:07.420
Yeah.

24:07.669 --> 24:09.232
I hate you.

24:09.602 --> 24:11.286
Let's go.

24:13.614 --> 24:16.460
Detective Folino,
we appreciate you coming back.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.067
We just have a few more questions.

24:18.192 --> 24:19.653
Do you recall William telling you

24:19.690 --> 24:23.603
someone named Rabbit gave him
the gun that shot Mr. Kim?

24:23.724 --> 24:26.432
And you told the court
you didn't know him?

24:26.526 --> 24:28.267
That's right. Never heard of him.

24:28.708 --> 24:31.700
Well, his real name
was Derrick Johnston.

24:31.737 --> 24:32.905
Have you heard of him?

24:32.942 --> 24:34.919
Maybe. Name sounds familiar.

24:34.982 --> 24:36.331
I bet it does.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.052
Your Honor, we'd like
to enter into the record

24:39.247 --> 24:42.060
an arrest report for Derrick Johnston

24:42.130 --> 24:44.278
on November 12, 2013.

24:44.338 --> 24:46.445
Assault with a deadly weapon.

24:46.609 --> 24:48.642
The arrest was made by the witness,

24:48.771 --> 24:50.896
Detective Joseph Folino.

24:50.933 --> 24:52.513
Now, your hand-written notes

24:52.550 --> 24:54.208
are on that report. Correct, Detective?

24:54.245 --> 24:55.951
- Correct.
- And what name did you use

24:55.988 --> 24:58.458
for Mr. Johnston at
the time of his arrest?

25:01.061 --> 25:03.043
Rabbit.

25:03.341 --> 25:05.825
And the date of that
arrest occurred <i> before</i>

25:05.862 --> 25:07.271
you arrested William.

25:07.739 --> 25:09.234
- True?
- Yes.

25:09.528 --> 25:11.569
So when William said Rabbit

25:11.606 --> 25:13.388
gave him that gun,

25:13.575 --> 25:16.309
you knew exactly who he was
talking about, didn't you?

25:16.347 --> 25:18.099
I-I don't know if I recall if I...

25:18.136 --> 25:19.802
But you never questioned

25:19.888 --> 25:21.913
a known felon.

25:22.661 --> 25:25.975
Look, criminals blame other
criminals when they're caught.

25:26.044 --> 25:28.216
That's probably why I didn't pursue it.

25:28.313 --> 25:30.052
The case against William was tight.

25:30.089 --> 25:32.442
It was tight
because you made it that way.

25:34.138 --> 25:36.002
By refusing to listen

25:36.039 --> 25:38.390
to a 14-year-old boy.

25:40.158 --> 25:41.942
I'm finished with this witness.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.988
How come you didn't testify
at the original trial?

25:55.159 --> 25:57.342
I didn't know it was happening.

25:57.896 --> 26:00.614
Afterwards, someone told me
William had shot someone.

26:00.671 --> 26:02.005
I was stunned.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.045
He was a sweet kid.

26:05.337 --> 26:07.488
Dave, shoo.

26:08.710 --> 26:11.470
The fanboys... they love me.

26:13.177 --> 26:14.653
Do you know anything about this?

26:14.727 --> 26:17.461
Sure. That's William
with Fordson Frank.

26:17.568 --> 26:19.247
He's a comic book legend.

26:19.364 --> 26:20.954
I took this picture myself.

26:21.638 --> 26:23.457
You did?

26:23.677 --> 26:25.458
Do you remember taking this photo?

26:25.495 --> 26:29.497
Yes. My signings were always
2:00 to 5:00,

26:29.567 --> 26:31.057
Saturday afternoons.

26:31.151 --> 26:32.435
I checked my calendar,

26:32.472 --> 26:36.114
and Fordson Frank was there
March 22, 2014.

26:36.195 --> 26:39.547
And Wan Lee Kim was shot
at 3:00 p.m. on that day.

26:40.036 --> 26:41.942
Can you say definitively

26:41.979 --> 26:44.536
that William was in your store
at that time?

26:44.581 --> 26:46.072
Absolutely.

26:46.322 --> 26:48.339
Thank you, Mr. Toth.

26:49.847 --> 26:53.934
How many people in attendance
that day, Mr. Toth?

26:54.771 --> 26:55.915
Ballpark.

26:55.952 --> 26:57.243
Maybe 40.

26:57.344 --> 26:58.584
And you're positive

26:58.621 --> 27:01.466
William was in your store
the whole time?

27:01.536 --> 27:03.181
Relatively positive.

27:03.299 --> 27:06.017
Relatively. I see.

27:06.135 --> 27:08.638
Tell that
to Mr. Kim's widow and children,

27:08.913 --> 27:11.689
who miss their father
and husband every day.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.724
"Relatively" doesn't bring him back.

27:14.761 --> 27:17.638
"Relatively" does not prove
that William Hurston was

27:17.675 --> 27:20.216
in <i>your store when Mr. Kim</i>
was murdered, does it?

27:20.284 --> 27:22.403
You murdered Rosemary!

27:22.646 --> 27:24.880
You're lying, Madeline.

27:34.426 --> 27:36.161
Ezekiel?

27:37.864 --> 27:39.817
When is William going to testify?

27:39.917 --> 27:41.326
We weren't planning on that.

27:41.406 --> 27:45.153
Mr. Boudreau, the jury thinks
my nephew is a monster.

27:45.255 --> 27:47.278
Put him on the stand.
Let them see who he is.

27:47.315 --> 27:50.316
William is not the sweet
14-year-old boy you remember.

27:50.958 --> 27:52.786
We put him on the stand, we could lose.

27:52.823 --> 27:55.741
- You don't know that.
- She's right. We don't.

27:55.778 --> 27:57.249
I didn't testify at my trial.

27:57.286 --> 27:59.393
I've always regretted it.
We should give William a chance.

27:59.417 --> 28:01.231
This case isn't about you, Madeline.

28:01.478 --> 28:03.487
I never said that it was.

28:05.005 --> 28:07.470
You hired me to protect your nephew.

28:07.858 --> 28:09.874
Let me do that.

28:10.020 --> 28:11.954
I'll see you both tomorrow.

28:15.888 --> 28:18.208
Don't ever contradict me
in front of a client again.

28:18.245 --> 28:21.130
Don't ever talk to me like that
in front of a client again.

28:31.157 --> 28:32.827
I'm just...

28:33.106 --> 28:35.149
not feeling myself.

28:35.980 --> 28:37.828
I'm angry at everyone.

28:38.352 --> 28:42.188
My law partner, my kids, my wife.

28:42.313 --> 28:44.446
She thinks I'm talking
to my pastor right now.

28:44.574 --> 28:46.924
But you came to a therapist instead.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.797
What do you think brought on
this shift in you?

28:50.031 --> 28:51.622
I have a client.

28:52.063 --> 28:54.805
He was convicted of murder
when he was 14,

28:55.019 --> 28:58.963
but he's six-foot-four
and looks a lot older.

29:00.334 --> 29:03.243
- So they never saw the kid in him.
- Your son...

29:03.348 --> 29:06.866
um, Michael... he's, uh... he's 14?

29:08.832 --> 29:10.938
I found a... a fake ID.

29:11.157 --> 29:12.758
I don't know
if Michael used it or not...

29:12.795 --> 29:15.040
But you're worried.

29:15.222 --> 29:16.856
Hmm.

29:18.198 --> 29:21.086
When I was 14,
I was a punk on the street.

29:21.854 --> 29:25.556
Our folks were so busy with
work, they barely missed me.

29:26.102 --> 29:29.218
I did whatever I wanted, so I
got in all kinds of trouble.

29:29.714 --> 29:32.715
I got beat within an inch of my life.

29:34.523 --> 29:35.979
I ended up running to the church,

29:36.016 --> 29:39.768
because, you know, it's a sanctuary.

29:41.039 --> 29:43.001
When I woke up the next morning,

29:43.235 --> 29:45.659
the light streaming
through the windows,

29:46.032 --> 29:48.070
I saw the face of Jesus,

29:48.555 --> 29:50.072
and I felt this...

29:51.313 --> 29:55.094
endless love, like I had finally
found what I needed.

29:56.256 --> 29:59.407
Why are you telling me this now?

30:04.958 --> 30:07.776
I guess we're all just
a little lost when we're 14.

30:08.054 --> 30:10.221
But you found your way.

30:10.683 --> 30:12.384
But will he find his?

30:13.051 --> 30:14.450
Michael?

30:14.813 --> 30:16.857
Let me ask you this.

30:17.136 --> 30:19.303
Does Michael know you're there for him?

30:20.698 --> 30:22.548
I don't know what he knows.

30:23.852 --> 30:26.700
Well, then maybe
you should let him hear you,

30:27.055 --> 30:29.004
and then really listen

30:29.515 --> 30:31.610
to what he has to say.

30:40.124 --> 30:43.884
Listen... I owe you an apology.

30:44.217 --> 30:46.686
I was, um, frustrated,

30:46.748 --> 30:49.155
and, you know, Michael's
been acting up lately and...

30:49.205 --> 30:51.608
You're afraid Michael
could end up like William.

30:51.826 --> 30:53.244
Yeah, but...

30:53.826 --> 30:56.123
I shouldn't have taken it out
on you and everyone, so...

30:56.209 --> 30:58.231
It's all right. We understand.

30:58.436 --> 31:00.592
It's actually what I wanted
to talk to you about.

31:00.803 --> 31:02.897
I still think
we need to let William testify.

31:02.980 --> 31:04.561
- Uh...
- You didn't let me finish

31:04.598 --> 31:05.891
what I wanted to say to William's aunt,

31:05.915 --> 31:07.039
so you need to hear me now.

31:07.201 --> 31:09.123
- All right.
- At my trial,

31:09.160 --> 31:11.585
my lawyer was afraid,
just like you are now.

31:11.772 --> 31:13.522
He thought the jury would hate me.

31:13.607 --> 31:16.016
I felt powerless and alone.

31:16.160 --> 31:18.752
That is exactly how William
is feeling right now.

31:18.881 --> 31:21.459
He won't say it, but deep down,
he wants to tell the world

31:21.496 --> 31:23.830
what really happened to him.
We need to give him that.

31:24.071 --> 31:25.696
You're right.

31:25.975 --> 31:27.928
I am afraid.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.022
Bellows is gonna come down
on William hard,

31:30.059 --> 31:31.817
and I don't know
how he's gonna respond,

31:31.854 --> 31:33.354
and the jury may hate him.

31:33.487 --> 31:35.787
Or they may really care about him,

31:36.239 --> 31:38.397
just like I know you do.

31:40.605 --> 31:42.123
Yeah.

31:42.943 --> 31:44.357
You're right.

31:45.631 --> 31:46.780
They need to hear him,

31:46.799 --> 31:49.133
just like they needed to hear you.

31:52.012 --> 31:55.013
We're gonna need you
to testify, William.

31:55.216 --> 31:58.076
Now, they're gonna ask you
why you confessed,

31:58.467 --> 32:00.219
why you had the gun that shot Mr. Kim.

32:00.741 --> 32:03.062
We need you to explain
to the jury what happened,

32:03.099 --> 32:04.890
just like you told us.

32:05.538 --> 32:07.371
You think you can do that?

32:11.459 --> 32:14.052
We want to show the jury
who the real William is.

32:14.624 --> 32:16.936
Not the kid who spent years in prison.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.624
The artist who loves comic books,

32:19.694 --> 32:22.387
who loves to draw.

32:35.214 --> 32:36.589
Okay.

32:37.558 --> 32:39.558
I'll testify.

32:43.456 --> 32:45.839
You did admit that you shot and killed

32:45.858 --> 32:47.382
Wan Lee Kim, correct?

32:48.081 --> 32:49.480
Yes, but I...

32:49.517 --> 32:51.289
And now you want us to believe
that you didn't mean it?

32:51.313 --> 32:52.839
- I didn't.
- So you lied.

32:52.924 --> 32:54.514
You're a liar. You're lying now

32:54.551 --> 32:56.564
because you want to get yourself
out of trouble, aren't you?

32:56.588 --> 32:58.862
- Stop saying that!
- You're lying, Madeline.

32:58.956 --> 33:02.544
No one believes you!
It's time to tell the truth.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.957
You murdered Rosemary.

33:05.143 --> 33:06.667
No, it-it ain't like that.

33:06.704 --> 33:09.456
You say that now, but that is
certainly not what you said

33:09.532 --> 33:12.667
at the time of the murder,
when you confessed.

33:15.486 --> 33:17.069
No further questions.

33:24.288 --> 33:25.788
William,

33:26.503 --> 33:28.123
how old are you in this photo?

33:28.905 --> 33:30.565
Fourteen.

33:34.363 --> 33:35.862
14 years old.

33:35.924 --> 33:38.737
And the detectives
questioned you for 20 hours?

33:39.009 --> 33:41.135
All I wanted was to go home.

33:41.909 --> 33:44.034
- To see your auntie?
- Yeah.

33:44.071 --> 33:46.432
And that's what the police
promised you, right?

33:46.542 --> 33:48.235
That if you confessed,

33:48.542 --> 33:50.659
you'd finally get to see her again?

33:51.006 --> 33:53.167
They said I'd get to go home.

33:54.645 --> 33:57.062
It's the only place
I've ever felt safe.

33:58.284 --> 33:59.766
My auntie...

34:00.003 --> 34:02.658
she bought me all my pencils
and drafting paper.

34:02.947 --> 34:04.033
She loved me.

34:04.070 --> 34:05.394
I still do.

34:05.431 --> 34:07.831
William Hurston only, please.

34:08.753 --> 34:10.569
What else did the police say?

34:10.818 --> 34:12.693
That I could trust them.

34:13.487 --> 34:15.112
That they needed me.

34:15.339 --> 34:17.556
They needed my help
to find the shooter.

34:19.797 --> 34:21.589
That I'd be a hero.

34:24.196 --> 34:26.034
So I showed them the gun,

34:26.469 --> 34:28.257
told them about Rabbit.

34:31.003 --> 34:33.292
But I didn't kill nobody.

34:33.524 --> 34:35.143
Heroes are the good guys.

34:35.234 --> 34:37.543
I'm a good guy.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.908
I was tired.

34:39.972 --> 34:42.514
I wanted to go home.

34:48.032 --> 34:50.120
Nothing further, Your Honor.

34:59.746 --> 35:02.254
- You should do the closing.
- Oh, no.

35:02.402 --> 35:05.090
No, I'm too close. I don't want
to get too emotional.

35:05.187 --> 35:07.587
Easy, William found you for a reason.

35:07.904 --> 35:09.236
He needs you.

35:10.831 --> 35:12.301
Okay.

35:13.627 --> 35:15.223
I'll do my best.

35:20.092 --> 35:21.758
What?

35:22.397 --> 35:24.413
I found Rosemary's mystery man.

35:24.967 --> 35:27.553
I checked flight records
for Rosemary's Stanford weekend.

35:27.590 --> 35:29.940
Checked every flight between
Chicago and the Bay Area,

35:29.977 --> 35:32.686
and I searched every person
named Jim or James,

35:32.869 --> 35:34.477
and I came up empty.

35:34.678 --> 35:38.530
But then I found a familiar name
on one of the flights.

35:39.296 --> 35:40.351
Levi.

35:42.944 --> 35:44.928
Rosemary was afraid of Levi.

35:44.999 --> 35:46.686
That doesn't mean he killed her.

35:46.747 --> 35:48.374
It means he could have.

35:48.739 --> 35:51.444
There's plenty of
reasonable doubt in this case.

35:54.577 --> 35:55.977
There's plenty of reasonable doubt.

35:56.369 --> 35:59.217
There's plenty of
reasonable doubt in this case.

36:01.428 --> 36:04.889
Hey, no matter how much
you push me away,

36:05.007 --> 36:07.059
no matter how much you think
you don't need me anymore,

36:07.083 --> 36:08.186
I love you,

36:08.346 --> 36:10.671
and I'm not going anywhere,
no matter what.

36:14.811 --> 36:17.491
Um, cool.

36:17.897 --> 36:20.240
I'm gonna get some ice cream.

36:21.157 --> 36:22.631
You want some?

36:22.712 --> 36:24.646
I'm good, but thanks.

36:26.105 --> 36:28.741
There's plenty of reasonable doubt.

36:36.770 --> 36:39.229
<i>Imagine a 14-year-old boy you know.</i>

36:39.864 --> 36:42.871
He's confident, maybe overly so,

36:42.934 --> 36:45.957
still learning about the world,
trying to fit in,

36:45.994 --> 36:48.494
impressing his friends
and making mistakes.

36:48.659 --> 36:50.254
Now imagine that same young boy

36:50.291 --> 36:52.049
in a room
with an experienced detective,

36:52.281 --> 36:55.442
and that detective confuses him
with empty promises.

36:55.691 --> 36:57.924
All he wants is to be believed.

36:58.324 --> 37:00.519
There's terror in his eyes.
He just wants it to end.

37:00.613 --> 37:02.154
He wants to go home.

37:03.807 --> 37:05.285
Can you see it?

37:05.474 --> 37:06.974
Because I can.

37:07.056 --> 37:10.067
And truth be told,
it keeps me up at night.

37:10.262 --> 37:12.803
Because no matter how much
you love and prepare your child,

37:12.840 --> 37:15.098
you can't protect them from everything.

37:15.439 --> 37:17.379
Now, isn't it possible...

37:18.302 --> 37:21.457
more likely than not,
that this young boy,

37:21.567 --> 37:24.526
hungry for approval,
told that trained detective

37:24.621 --> 37:26.910
what he thought he wanted to hear?

37:27.699 --> 37:29.184
Now, if you believe that's possible,

37:29.221 --> 37:30.715
that's reasonable doubt.

37:31.632 --> 37:33.270
The State would want you to believe

37:33.307 --> 37:34.817
that no one would ever confess

37:34.854 --> 37:37.186
to a crime they did not commit.

37:38.353 --> 37:41.371
But use your common sense
and life experience.

37:41.763 --> 37:43.487
We all know that's not true,

37:44.270 --> 37:45.990
and they know it.

37:46.379 --> 37:48.164
Now imagine William Hurston.

37:48.299 --> 37:52.160
He was that scared,
lonely 14-year-old boy.

37:53.327 --> 37:55.332
And that detective tricked him

37:55.692 --> 37:59.692
into admitting to a crime
he did not commit.

38:01.967 --> 38:04.476
And that's what this case
boils down to.

38:05.893 --> 38:10.529
And that's why you should
find William not guilty.

38:12.485 --> 38:14.098
Thank you.

38:21.078 --> 38:22.393
We learn in Leviticus

38:22.430 --> 38:24.153
that when anybody becomes aware
of the fact

38:24.190 --> 38:27.312
that they are guilty,
they must confess.

38:27.695 --> 38:30.648
That is exactly what happened
with this defendant.

38:30.703 --> 38:32.703
Don't let Mr. Boudreau
and Ms. Scott confuse you.

38:32.806 --> 38:34.990
THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION:

38:35.484 --> 38:37.328
did William Hurston

38:37.365 --> 38:40.399
shoot and kill Wan Lee Kim?

38:41.187 --> 38:43.867
I say, beyond a shadow
of a doubt, the answer is yes.

38:44.458 --> 38:46.435
Now, Ms. Scott and Mr. Boudreau
would have you believe

38:46.459 --> 38:48.407
that Detective Folino exerted

38:48.444 --> 38:52.130
some sort of power over the defendant,

38:52.348 --> 38:54.609
by calling into question
his character...

38:54.646 --> 38:57.647
a respected detective with
the Chicago Police Department.

38:57.898 --> 39:00.067
Now, you heard Detective Folino.

39:00.354 --> 39:02.234
By no measure...

39:02.389 --> 39:05.715
did he strong-arm this defendant.

39:06.113 --> 39:09.719
He conducted a fair
and thorough interview

39:10.015 --> 39:11.807
and obtained a confession.

39:12.977 --> 39:15.654
Now, I ask you for a moment
to consider the victim,

39:15.951 --> 39:17.344
Wan Lee Kim.

39:17.445 --> 39:21.143
Think about the fear in his eyes

39:21.766 --> 39:24.830
when this young man
held a gun to his head

39:24.906 --> 39:26.555
and shot him.

39:26.789 --> 39:28.734
Think about that moment.

39:29.715 --> 39:33.703
The moment when he realized
he was about to die.

39:34.484 --> 39:35.901
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:35.984 --> 39:38.008
YOU MUST ASK YOURSELVES ONE QUESTION:

39:38.197 --> 39:41.570
If he didn't do it, why did he confess?

39:41.828 --> 39:43.244
Why?

39:43.820 --> 39:45.502
THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE:

39:45.543 --> 39:48.969
because he did do this heinous crime.

39:49.797 --> 39:52.357
On behalf of the People
of the State of Illinois,

39:52.513 --> 39:56.398
I'm asking that you find him
guilty of murder.

40:01.942 --> 40:04.027
Appearances matter.

40:04.472 --> 40:07.689
What the world sees in us
sets expectations.

40:07.910 --> 40:10.691
<i>The world defined William
Hurston by the way he looked.</i>

40:10.780 --> 40:11.980
<i>No, no!</i>

40:12.063 --> 40:13.195
<i>They labeled him a killer,</i>

40:13.222 --> 40:15.371
<i>and they treated him like one.</i>

40:16.699 --> 40:19.959
<i>But inside, he screamed back,</i>

40:20.746 --> 40:23.296
"I'm not a killer."

40:23.910 --> 40:25.949
"I'm a superhero."

40:27.629 --> 40:29.271
Jury's back.

40:36.302 --> 40:38.026
Have you reached a verdict?

40:38.105 --> 40:40.691
- We have, Your Honor.
- How find you?

40:40.762 --> 40:41.991
We find the defendant,

40:42.028 --> 40:44.711
William Richmond Hurston, not guilty.

40:47.777 --> 40:50.387
Mr. Hurston, you are free to go.

40:51.153 --> 40:53.004
Thank you.

40:56.915 --> 40:59.249
- Thank you so much.
- Mm.

41:00.519 --> 41:03.551
If we make the next news cycle,
no one will even notice.

41:03.626 --> 41:05.609
- Are we ready?
- All set.

41:05.691 --> 41:07.691
It's time we change the narrative.

41:08.092 --> 41:09.925
I don't like the word "victim."

41:09.995 --> 41:11.421
I prefer "survivor,"

41:11.588 --> 41:14.035
because that's what happens
when a crime occurs

41:14.258 --> 41:15.902
and you're the one left standing.

41:16.048 --> 41:17.668
You survive.

41:19.222 --> 41:21.176
I will work with state legislators

41:21.213 --> 41:23.387
to enact Rosemary's Law,

41:23.650 --> 41:26.076
named in honor of Rosemary Lynch,

41:26.318 --> 41:28.543
whose mother, a survivor,

41:29.022 --> 41:31.006
we have here today.

41:32.085 --> 41:33.590
Mrs. Lynch.

41:33.863 --> 41:36.130
Barbara Lynch knows that there
is a pervasive injustice

41:36.167 --> 41:37.668
in our society.

41:38.057 --> 41:41.541
With Rosemary's Law,
we can bring justice to her

41:41.730 --> 41:43.465
and to all survivors,

41:43.588 --> 41:48.113
because no survivor
should be silenced or alone.

41:57.743 --> 42:01.258
How did you get in here?

42:01.377 --> 42:02.893
Mom gave me a spare key.

42:02.930 --> 42:04.539
She wouldn't do that.

42:04.680 --> 42:07.142
I came to talk to you
about my assault case.

42:07.235 --> 42:08.477
You broke into my place.

42:08.514 --> 42:11.492
What the hell is all this, Maddie? Huh?

42:13.070 --> 42:14.708
What happened between you and Rosemary?

42:14.766 --> 42:16.599
Stop talking to me like a lawyer!

42:16.636 --> 42:18.486
Stop acting like a criminal.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.094
I know you followed her to Stanford.

42:20.131 --> 42:22.298
She was scared of you.

42:23.899 --> 42:25.842
No, um, no, no.

42:25.879 --> 42:27.766
L-Let me just explain that.

42:30.427 --> 42:32.361
You're afraid of me?

42:33.172 --> 42:35.219
I think that you should leave.

42:39.023 --> 42:40.791
Okay.

42:42.928 --> 42:44.636
Okay, I'll go.

43:00.864 --> 43:03.290
I love you, sis.

43:06.543 --> 43:08.126
I love you, too.
