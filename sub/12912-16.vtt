00:03.500 --> 00:05.220
<i>* In this world *</i>

00:05.300 --> 00:06.500
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

00:06.580 --> 00:10.300
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

00:10.380 --> 00:12.620
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

00:12.700 --> 00:17.060
<i>* Find our way</i>

00:17.140 --> 00:18.620
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

00:18.700 --> 00:20.500
<i>* Swimming in the sea *</i>

00:20.580 --> 00:21.900

00:21.980 --> 00:23.860

00:23.940 --> 00:24.940

00:27.380 --> 00:28.900

00:28.980 --> 00:30.340

00:30.420 --> 00:32.580
<i>* Together *</i>

00:32.659 --> 00:34.020
<i>* Forever *</i>

00:34.100 --> 00:37.780
<i>* Together lying
in the sun *</i>

00:37.860 --> 00:38.980
<i>* Together *</i>

00:39.060 --> 00:40.700
<i>* Forever *</i>

00:40.780 --> 00:41.940
<i>* Together *</i>

00:42.020 --> 00:44.820
<i>* Just be you and me *</i>

00:44.900 --> 00:48.460
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>

01:08.020 --> 01:09.420
Ms. Chadwick?

01:10.580 --> 01:11.820
Ms. Chadwick?

01:13.180 --> 01:14.660
We're almost done.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.620
I'll need to pack that now.
-Of course.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.020
This one's always
been my favorite.

01:21.020 --> 01:23.220
I'm certain it has a
fascinating history.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.300
There must be something
the pod can do about the dragon.

01:32.380 --> 01:34.380
I've seen
what this creature can do.

01:34.460 --> 01:37.620
Without the Jiao Long bracelet,
I don't like their chances.

01:40.260 --> 01:41.860
You don't have to
worry about the dragon.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.060
It's gone?

01:43.140 --> 01:45.980
The mermaid council
just announced its plan.

01:46.060 --> 01:48.060
When the moon rises,
they will enter the moon pool

01:48.140 --> 01:50.460
and unleash the
full power of Mako.

01:50.540 --> 01:51.940
No more dragon.

01:52.780 --> 01:53.900
Just like that?

01:55.060 --> 01:56.500
They seem pretty
sure it'll work.

01:58.020 --> 02:00.500
So where's Mimmi?
-She needed some time alone.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.020
How come?

02:25.500 --> 02:26.980
I heard about Chris.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.740
Are you okay?

02:29.820 --> 02:31.100
I'm fine.

02:32.180 --> 02:33.860
It's probably for the best.

02:35.140 --> 02:36.940
There's my big, tough sis.

02:45.340 --> 02:47.020
Why's it doing that?

02:53.900 --> 02:55.100
It's her.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.980
My children.

03:15.140 --> 03:17.260
You saw her... right?

03:20.580 --> 03:21.660
What's going on?

03:22.580 --> 03:23.820
I have no idea.

03:31.580 --> 03:32.980
This time...

03:39.500 --> 03:41.060
Ah, Weilan.

03:41.140 --> 03:42.700
Always a delight to see you.

03:45.340 --> 03:46.540
Problem?

03:47.900 --> 03:50.740
Okay, we have tea and talk.

03:50.820 --> 03:54.300
I need a break from tinkering
with this most stubborn mechanism.

03:55.220 --> 03:56.220
What's wrong with it?

03:56.300 --> 03:59.420
Ah, wound up too tight...
like you.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.980
It would take a magician
to make it work.

04:05.940 --> 04:07.660
You put up the painting.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.700
Ah, yes. Look nice.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.460
Also, got new stock in.
Many bargains.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.460
You don't have anything
that can kill a dragon, do you?

04:15.540 --> 04:17.339
Kill a dragon?

04:17.420 --> 04:19.220
Like in the Jiao Long legend.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.300
That's not what
happened in the legend.

04:22.780 --> 04:24.900
But you said...
-No.

04:24.980 --> 04:26.380
The dragon was not killed.

04:29.780 --> 04:32.260
<i>We both saw her.</i>
<i>In the moon pool?</i>

04:32.340 --> 04:35.300
As close as you are now,
and she spoke to us.

04:35.380 --> 04:36.860
But Weilan said Nerissa was...

04:36.940 --> 04:39.220
Weilan only said that
Nerissa disappeared.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.820
No one knows for certain
what happened to her.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.340
I am sure that she was trying
to communicate with us.

04:43.420 --> 04:45.100
Why would she do that?

04:46.860 --> 04:49.420
What if the dragon didn't kill her?
- What?

04:49.500 --> 04:51.540
What if our mother is alive
and reaching out to us?

04:51.620 --> 04:52.700
What if she needs our help?

04:52.780 --> 04:55.380
Now, hang on...
-Mimmi might be right.

04:56.780 --> 05:00.380
A long time ago, a Chinese mermaid
fell in love with a land boy.

05:00.460 --> 05:01.700
Another pod heard about it

05:01.780 --> 05:05.020
and decided to punish the mermaid
and the pod for letting it happen.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.220
So, guess what?

05:06.300 --> 05:08.820
They turned the land boy
into a water dragon.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.700
The Jiao Long Dragon.

05:10.780 --> 05:12.300
Now, here's the good bit.

05:12.380 --> 05:16.420
The mermaid used a bracelet to break
the spell and free the land boy.

05:17.820 --> 05:21.500
Does anybody see where I'm going with
this or do I have to draw diagrams?

05:21.580 --> 05:24.140
What if our mother is under
the same kind of powerful spell?

05:24.220 --> 05:26.460
And what if the
bracelet could free her?

05:26.540 --> 05:27.740
Guys, come on.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.100
The dragon is a serious threat.

05:29.180 --> 05:30.620
It took Evie's tail.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.380
It could have taken my tail,
and Mimmi's, but it didn't.

05:33.460 --> 05:37.020
After what we saw this morning, I'm
sure our mother is calling to us.

05:37.940 --> 05:39.060
She needs our help.

05:39.980 --> 05:41.060
We should talk to Veridia.

05:47.420 --> 05:48.700
Do you think it could be true?

05:48.780 --> 05:51.700
It's the only thing that makes
sense of everything that's happened.

05:54.500 --> 05:57.100
We need to get that bracelet.

05:57.180 --> 05:58.700
Now, why didn't I think of that?

06:01.620 --> 06:03.060
Well, the books
seem to have sold well.

06:03.140 --> 06:04.900
Very well, Ms. Chadwick.

06:04.980 --> 06:06.820
I think the tour's going to be
a great success.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.340
I'll call a taxi to take us
back to the hotel.

06:09.420 --> 06:12.100
I'll meet you there. There's
something I need to do first.

06:15.220 --> 06:17.420
Veridia, please?

06:17.500 --> 06:19.260
We know what we saw.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.580
I understand that you
want your mother back,

06:21.660 --> 06:23.300
but you have no proof
that she is alive.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.540
We both saw her.
She spoke to us.

06:25.620 --> 06:27.340
I have no doubt that you think
you saw something...

06:27.420 --> 06:29.020
We did see her! She's alive!

06:29.100 --> 06:31.580
You need to give us
the chance to save her!

06:31.660 --> 06:33.220
I have the welfare of
the pod to consider.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.460
We are part of the pod, too.

06:35.540 --> 06:38.860
I'm sorry...
but the risk is too great.

06:39.740 --> 06:42.460
We must destroy the dragon
or we will never be safe.

06:50.980 --> 06:54.180
Yes, I'm ready now.
I'll be waiting outside.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.260
What happened to all the stuff?

06:58.340 --> 06:59.820
I'm sorry,
but it's all been packed away.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.100
Where's Ms. Chadwick?

07:01.180 --> 07:03.260
She's just left.
-Where did she go?

07:03.340 --> 07:04.660
She didn't say.

07:04.740 --> 07:06.820
If you want her book,
you can buy it online.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.380
Good afternoon.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.020
We need to find her.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.020
There can't be too many places
where a rich, famous,

07:14.100 --> 07:15.820
underwater explorer
would hang out.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.580
That's not all she is.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.900
Meaning?

07:20.980 --> 07:23.700
Where would a mermaid hang out?

07:28.060 --> 07:29.500
We can't let them do this.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.540
The council's decision is final.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.460
I'm sorry.

07:38.340 --> 07:39.820
But she's our mother.

07:43.340 --> 07:45.860
I know this is hard
for you to accept...

07:45.940 --> 07:50.060
but what if the council is right
and the dragon is just a dragon?

07:50.140 --> 07:51.940
But what if they're wrong?

08:16.260 --> 08:17.980
We thought we'd find you here.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.860
You should really
do something with this place.

08:21.940 --> 08:24.260
It hasn't changed at all
since I was last here.

08:24.860 --> 08:26.060
We like it this way.

08:26.140 --> 08:27.580
Suit yourselves.

08:27.660 --> 08:30.540
This is where it all
began for you, isn't it?

08:32.500 --> 08:34.220
This is where you
became a mermaid.

08:38.179 --> 08:40.419
I was here with two friends...

08:40.500 --> 08:41.659
under the full moon.

08:41.740 --> 08:44.340
It must have been
quite a surprise.

08:44.420 --> 08:45.580
Surprise?

08:46.460 --> 08:48.980
One day, you're a normal teenage
girl, and the next, you're...

08:49.060 --> 08:50.420
this.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.180
Was it really that bad?

08:54.780 --> 08:58.180
First dive over Mako
reef was amazing...

08:59.500 --> 09:02.980
like all the best feelings in
the world all rolled into one.

09:07.060 --> 09:08.660
We felt so special.

09:10.220 --> 09:14.380
Then everything becomes about
keeping the secret.

09:15.780 --> 09:19.180
And you don't know who to trust,
so you don't trust anyone.

09:22.180 --> 09:25.140
It was us three
versus the world.

09:25.220 --> 09:26.700
What happened to your friends?

09:26.780 --> 09:27.940
We grew up.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.820
Found other interests.

09:32.380 --> 09:34.420
Even mermaids move on.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.100
You miss them... don't you?

09:38.860 --> 09:42.140
Mermaids share a secret
that bind us together.

09:43.820 --> 09:46.780
When you were swimming on
the reef with your friends,

09:46.860 --> 09:49.100
didn't you feel like
you were sisters?

09:50.740 --> 09:53.660
Think how bad you felt
when you lost your friends.

09:54.580 --> 09:58.380
Imagine how bad it would feel
to lose a hundred sisters.

10:01.900 --> 10:05.220
You came here because
you were drawn here.

10:06.260 --> 10:07.660
Don't you see?

10:09.500 --> 10:10.540
You're just like us...

10:12.100 --> 10:14.260
a Mako mermaid.

10:18.180 --> 10:19.860
Let us have the bracelet.

10:21.060 --> 10:22.540
Please?

10:24.580 --> 10:27.860
Everything I find,
I donate to the foundation.

10:27.940 --> 10:31.780
It would take days of filling out
forms if I asked to take the bracelet.

10:33.740 --> 10:34.900
So...

10:35.820 --> 10:37.500
why bother asking?

10:41.020 --> 10:43.420
Careful. It's fragile.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.020
And that, too.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.500
It's in that blue box.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.420
Take care.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.180
Turn that off, now!

10:56.060 --> 10:57.220
Hurry up!

11:00.940 --> 11:02.100
What is going on?

11:02.180 --> 11:03.460
I don't know.

11:03.540 --> 11:07.220
Ah, this is ridiculous!
Will you please open the door?

11:10.780 --> 11:12.940
Oh, thank you.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.020
You have to teach
me how to do that.

11:17.620 --> 11:19.220
Careful with that.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.380
Thank you.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.780
Good luck.

11:22.860 --> 11:24.660
Yes, that, too, and careful.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.780
There has to be some other kind
of magic that can break the spell.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.700
Even if there is,
we don't have time to find it.

11:34.460 --> 11:35.700
We have to get that bracelet.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.260
You mean, this bracelet?

11:51.980 --> 11:53.860
Any idea how it works?

11:54.900 --> 11:57.460
The Jiao Long painting
didn't show instructions.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.500
Who's going to use it?

12:06.220 --> 12:08.100
I got pretty close
to the dragon last time.

12:10.820 --> 12:12.580
It has to be a mermaid.

12:18.020 --> 12:19.060
Go for it.

14:15.740 --> 14:18.100
No!
-We'll stop this!

14:22.260 --> 14:23.620
Now, Mimmi!

14:41.260 --> 14:42.420
She's here!

14:44.140 --> 14:45.540
I can feel her!

14:46.420 --> 14:47.700
I can feel her, too!

14:53.860 --> 14:55.980
Zac and Mimmi
are out there with the dragon.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.700
You have to stop this.

14:57.780 --> 14:59.980
Give them a chance
to save their mother.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.020
Please!
-It is too late.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.700
It is beyond our control!

15:21.060 --> 15:22.100
Mother!

15:25.860 --> 15:26.900
Mother!

15:26.980 --> 15:28.620
Come back!

15:40.900 --> 15:42.620
Mimmi!

15:42.700 --> 15:43.740
Mimmi!

15:43.820 --> 15:45.220
Mimmi!

15:46.020 --> 15:47.060
Mimmi!

15:48.100 --> 15:49.100
Mimmi!

15:59.060 --> 16:00.620
Mimmi!

16:02.460 --> 16:04.100
Mimmi!

17:01.060 --> 17:02.660
My children.

17:17.020 --> 17:19.060
When the battle
with the Eastern Pod

17:19.140 --> 17:21.060
turned against Aurora,

17:21.140 --> 17:23.740
she used a spell
to turn me into the dragon.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.740
Then she made me
attack Weilan's pod.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.180
I can't tell you
how awful that was.

17:31.460 --> 17:35.700
After the Eastern Pod were
defeated, I lay in a deep sleep.

17:35.780 --> 17:36.860
As the years passed...

17:37.980 --> 17:42.340
I dreamed that my children
had found each other.

17:42.940 --> 17:46.260
Rita always thought there was a
reason we were left so close together.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.540
Me on Mako, and Zac on land.

17:50.580 --> 17:52.420
Once you found each other,

17:52.500 --> 17:55.940
your connection, your love,
touched me...

17:56.020 --> 17:58.220
and began to lift the spell.

17:59.580 --> 18:00.940
It took a long time,

18:01.020 --> 18:04.500
but one day, I came awake,
and then I saw Weilan.

18:04.580 --> 18:05.900
See?

18:05.980 --> 18:07.940
You did bring the dragon.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.620
And you just love being right.
-Mmm-hmm.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.820
Many years ago,
I left you here...

18:13.820 --> 18:16.460
not knowing if I would
ever see you again.

18:17.340 --> 18:19.620
It was the hardest
thing I have ever done.

18:20.860 --> 18:23.020
I will never leave you again.

18:34.100 --> 18:38.700
So you're telling us that last night
there was a massive, magical storm,

18:38.780 --> 18:40.820
this bracelet
destroyed the dragon,

18:40.900 --> 18:42.300
and no one took any photos?

18:42.380 --> 18:43.540
Cam!

18:45.140 --> 18:46.380
It's a beautiful story.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.180
You must be so happy
to have your mother back.

18:48.260 --> 18:49.700
I'm still having
trouble believing it.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.860
Bring her in for a meal anytime.
On the house.

18:54.020 --> 18:55.820
You know what the
really weird thing is?

18:56.820 --> 18:57.900
I now have two mothers.

18:57.980 --> 19:00.420
Are you going to
tell your parents about Nerissa?

19:01.740 --> 19:02.900
I think I will.

19:03.860 --> 19:06.100
They took me in and
gave me everything.

19:06.180 --> 19:08.180
They deserve to know
where I came from and...

19:08.260 --> 19:09.340
who I really am.

19:11.140 --> 19:12.820
I think they'll
be good with that.

19:34.940 --> 19:36.500
Hello?

20:05.420 --> 20:06.700
Huh!

20:09.780 --> 20:10.980
Magic.

20:35.740 --> 20:37.220
You want to know my secret?

21:34.780 --> 21:37.500
I can't believe Veridia
gave you a moon ring.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.100
I think it suits me.

21:39.180 --> 21:40.860
I suppose you'll
be wanting lessons?

21:41.780 --> 21:42.820
Know any good teachers?

21:48.740 --> 21:50.660
I guess the bracelet worked.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.580
I'll never be able
to thank you enough.

21:53.980 --> 21:57.180
What made you change your mind?
-You have very persuasive friends.

21:59.260 --> 22:00.740
No, you keep it.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.500
I'll enjoy watching Mr. Singh
figure out where it went.

22:07.020 --> 22:09.420
Will you come back one day
and meet our pod?

22:09.500 --> 22:11.100
I wouldn't miss it.

22:12.020 --> 22:15.460
Plus, I think I've got some
friends who might be interested.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.340
Mako is their home, too.

22:18.020 --> 22:19.860
Speaking of pods,

22:19.940 --> 22:22.580
I was thinking
I might go back to Shanghai.

22:22.660 --> 22:24.300
Start the Eastern Pod again.

22:25.540 --> 22:26.860
Would you like some company?

22:28.020 --> 22:29.180
You're leaving Mako?

22:29.260 --> 22:30.860
Not forever.

22:30.940 --> 22:33.220
Besides, I could never
leave you on your own.

22:33.300 --> 22:35.420
Who'd keep you out of trouble?

22:37.100 --> 22:39.460
You and Zac will be getting
to know Nerissa.

22:39.540 --> 22:43.820
And I was thinking that I could
learn to cook some real Chinese food.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.380
Not those awful Pot Noodles
you make, though.

22:46.460 --> 22:49.060
You? Learn to cook anything
edible? I don't think so.

22:49.140 --> 22:51.060
Aw, give the girl a break.

22:51.140 --> 22:53.220
Yeah. My cooking's not that bad.

22:53.300 --> 22:55.780
You're right, it's not bad.
It's terrible.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.260
Hey!

22:58.100 --> 22:59.780
<i>* In this world *</i>

22:59.860 --> 23:01.220
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

23:01.300 --> 23:04.620
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

23:04.700 --> 23:06.700
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

23:06.780 --> 23:11.700
<i>* Find our way</i>
<i>Through this mystery *</i>

23:11.780 --> 23:13.300

23:13.380 --> 23:14.780

23:14.860 --> 23:16.100

23:16.180 --> 23:18.300
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:18.380 --> 23:19.900
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:19.980 --> 23:21.540
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:21.620 --> 23:23.100
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:23.180 --> 23:25.540
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:25.620 --> 23:27.140
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:27.220 --> 23:29.860
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:29.940 --> 23:31.540
<i>* Ooh *</i>

23:31.620 --> 23:33.700
<i>* Ooh ooh *</i>

23:33.780 --> 23:36.460
<i>* Ooh ooh ooh *</i>

23:36.540 --> 23:37.940
<i>* Just be you and me *</i>

23:38.020 --> 23:39.780
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:39.860 --> 23:41.260
<i>* Swimming in the sea *</i>

23:41.340 --> 23:42.900
<i>* Now it's just you and me *</i>

23:42.980 --> 23:45.020
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:45.100 --> 23:46.420
<i>* I just wanna be *</i>

23:46.500 --> 23:47.980
<i>* With you feeling free *</i>

23:48.060 --> 23:49.660
<i>* It's my destiny *</i>

23:49.740 --> 23:51.860
<i>* Forever, ever, ever *</i>

23:51.940 --> 23:53.460
<i>* Together *</i>

23:53.540 --> 23:55.180
<i>* Forever *</i>

23:55.260 --> 23:58.500
<i>* Together lying
in the sun *</i>

23:58.580 --> 24:00.060
<i>* Together *</i>

24:00.140 --> 24:01.700
<i>* Forever *</i>

24:01.780 --> 24:03.020
<i>* Together *</i>

24:03.100 --> 24:06.020
<i>* Just be you and me *</i>

24:08.100 --> 24:10.780
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>
