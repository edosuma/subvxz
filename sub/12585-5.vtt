WEBVTT

00:31.906 --> 00:33.950
It's not an "endless salad bar"

00:34.034 --> 00:35.994
if they bring you the entree right away.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.705
I mean, you have the right to more salad,

00:38.788 --> 00:39.998
but once you've got your meat,

00:40.081 --> 00:41.958
you're not going back, and they know it.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.960
Message!

00:44.753 --> 00:46.046
Maybe it's that guy

00:46.129 --> 00:48.214
trying to call his parole officer again.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.926
Or it could be that SUV's owner
thanking me for the note

00:52.010 --> 00:53.845
suggesting they learn to park better.

00:53.928 --> 00:58.391
And the mystery caller is...

00:58.475 --> 01:00.518
Just play the dang message.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.645
<i>Of course you're not there!</i>

01:02.729 --> 01:03.813
Oh, Cotton.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.273
<i>But you better be tomorrow,</i>

01:05.356 --> 01:07.776
<i>'cause I'm finally getting rid
of my vehicle.</i>

01:07.859 --> 01:11.738
<i>I'll arrive at 1200 hours
to turn over the keys. That is all.</i>

01:12.322 --> 01:15.450
I'll be darned.
Dad's finally letting go of his Cadillac.

01:15.533 --> 01:16.701
That car's taken me

01:16.785 --> 01:19.204
to some of the greatest
events of my childhood.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.082
Football games, baseball games,

01:22.165 --> 01:23.750
basketball games.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.461
It's been like a member of the family.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.463
Except that Cotton loved it.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.048
Huh.

01:30.548 --> 01:31.674
Yeah.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.054
Yep, my dad should be here
with the car any minute now.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.474
I still remember the day
he brought that car home.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.059
It was on my birthday.

01:41.684 --> 01:44.771
After that it became known
as the car's birthday.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.066
Now we'll finally be able
to celebrate together.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.527
Remember how we'd ride back
from Boy Scouts

01:50.610 --> 01:51.653
and I'd talk too much,

01:51.736 --> 01:53.530
and Cotton would throw me in the trunk?

01:53.613 --> 01:56.157
It was like a crazy
roller coaster back there,

01:56.241 --> 01:58.409
bouncing around with all those guns.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.287
Yeah, man, talkin' about
them old good times, man.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.832
-
Here it comes!

02:09.003 --> 02:10.213
It's in perfect tune.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.300
-Good noon, Colonel!

02:14.384 --> 02:16.052
Yeah, Dad, thanks for coming.

02:16.136 --> 02:20.056
I appreciate the chance to buy
a piece of our family history.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.518
Buy it? The only thing you get
is the chance to wash it.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.145
Do a good job for once.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.396
I don't want your cousin Dusty

02:26.479 --> 02:28.523
finding any dog dirt on the pedals.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.234
Dusty? Well, what's he got to do with it?

02:31.317 --> 02:34.362
He called and made me an offer,
right out of the blue.

02:34.445 --> 02:35.697
You're selling it to him?

02:35.780 --> 02:37.699
Nah. I'm giving it to him.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.451
I couldn't take money
from my brother's boy.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.329
Dusty's always been like a son to me.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.581
I'm your son!

02:44.664 --> 02:46.374
I suppose.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.836
But Dusty's already got
more cars than he knows what to do with.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.088
He sure as heck doesn't deserve this one.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.341
You can keep the bucket,
but give these to Dusty.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.143
And that's how I get to the grocery store.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.938
No. I swear to you, Hank isn't here.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.440
Now, as I was saying...

03:10.523 --> 03:12.275
Oh, Hank just walked in.

03:12.358 --> 03:13.484
It's Dusty.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.112
My mistake.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.114
It was just a bird caught in the curtains.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.657
Okay, bye.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.075
What did he want?

03:21.159 --> 03:24.245
Dusty is coming in from Houston
tomorrow to pick up the car.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.622
Oh, great.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.708
While he's here, he can take
some other things I care about.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.835
It was nice being married to you, Peggy.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.128
Come on, Hank.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.755
So you and Dusty don't get along.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.799
That makes this a great opportunity
to patch things up.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.092
Patch things up?

03:38.176 --> 03:39.844
Don't you remember our wedding?

03:39.928 --> 03:43.056
How he and his buddies
got up on stage with the band?

03:43.139 --> 03:44.849
"Just one song, Hank."

03:44.933 --> 03:47.310
Which is all he played, one song.

03:47.393 --> 03:51.314
Yeah, "Radar Love,"
with a got-dang 20-minute bass solo.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.444
I'd better go tell Bobby
the truth about Dusty.

03:56.527 --> 03:59.239
It was crazy for me to think
he'd never find out.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.493
<i>Uh, son,</i>

04:03.576 --> 04:05.745
every family has its secrets.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.121
Now...

04:07.205 --> 04:08.998
I'm gonna play this tape,

04:09.540 --> 04:11.751
and you're gonna see
some things that, uh...

04:11.834 --> 04:14.337
This is harder than I thought.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.589
Just watch, if you can.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.888
You see, Bobby,

04:23.972 --> 04:25.723
I have a cousin named Dusty.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.725
He's the one with the beard.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.644
The-the one on the left.

04:29.727 --> 04:32.146
We're related to ZZ Top?!

04:32.230 --> 04:33.940
Not so loud, son.

04:34.023 --> 04:38.569
See, rock stars have different morals
and values and...

04:39.404 --> 04:40.571
Stop that!

04:41.656 --> 04:43.783
Now, Dusty's coming by the house tomorrow.

04:43.866 --> 04:46.244
Do not ask him what time it is.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.788
He always says, "It's time to rock."

04:50.957 --> 04:53.501
I bet the first thing Dusty does
with this car

04:53.584 --> 04:55.378
is put flames on the front of it

04:55.461 --> 04:57.005
like he did with his go-cart.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.173
Yeah, like that made it go faster.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.633
Wait, it didn't?

05:00.717 --> 05:02.677
Dusty's always been about flash.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.972
Have you ever looked at
our high school yearbook?

05:06.055 --> 05:07.390
Many, many times.

05:07.473 --> 05:11.728
He and his idiot friends snuck
into every activities picture.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.688
Remember how they
tricked you into thinking

05:13.771 --> 05:15.440
that Tom Landry died.

05:15.523 --> 05:18.526
Yeah, and then when he finally
did die, I didn't believe it,

05:18.609 --> 05:20.111
and I went to work anyway.

05:20.194 --> 05:21.904
I'm still mortified.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.450
They were always pulling
those practical jokes on me.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.545
So I'm getting a propane award, huh?

05:37.628 --> 05:39.172
Wow, this is such an honor.

05:39.255 --> 05:41.257
I-Is Commissioner Hogarth here?

05:41.341 --> 05:44.135
Hey, everyone, we've
hired a new dancer!

05:44.218 --> 05:45.219
What?!

05:59.108 --> 06:00.485
Idiots.

06:00.568 --> 06:01.736
Say...

06:01.819 --> 06:02.987
nice Caddy.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.239
Cotton gave it to Hank's cousin Dusty.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.325
Bit of a sore point.

06:07.408 --> 06:08.701
Your cousin, eh?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.912
Isn't that hillbilly term for wife?

06:10.995 --> 06:12.455
Th-There's a taxi coming!

06:12.538 --> 06:13.790
I bet it's Dusty.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.667
Famous people like to be
kissed on the cheek, right?

06:16.751 --> 06:18.044
I'm thinking about doing that.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.547
There they are!

06:21.631 --> 06:22.465
Hey, Hank.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.134
Dale. Bill. Boomhauer.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.470
Dusty Hill?!

06:28.388 --> 06:29.430
Hank Hill?!

06:29.514 --> 06:32.141
Why didn't you say
you were related to the man

06:32.225 --> 06:35.311
whose band helped launch
the story-driven music video?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.814
Well, you just answered your own question.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.023
I got to get Minh!

06:39.107 --> 06:40.608
"Tush" is her favorite song!

06:41.734 --> 06:42.735
Say...

06:42.819 --> 06:44.821
the old gal looks pretty snazzy.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.243
Yeah, well, anyway, uh,
you'll probably want

06:50.326 --> 06:52.787
to be getting back to Houston
and your current wife.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.832
You know,

06:55.915 --> 06:59.210
while I was out there touring
and making records and whatnot,

06:59.293 --> 07:01.796
I let some things slip by
that really matter to me.

07:01.879 --> 07:03.256
Friends,

07:03.339 --> 07:04.340
family.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.551
I guess what I'm trying to say is,

07:06.634 --> 07:08.594
it's be nice spending a couple of days

07:08.678 --> 07:10.513
hanging out with you, just catching up.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.433
Well, uh, I don't know, uh...

07:14.475 --> 07:16.269
Is this him?! Are you him?

07:16.352 --> 07:17.728
Oh, my god!

07:18.729 --> 07:20.857
Can I speak at him, please?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.817
Looks like your dad's raising you right.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.069
Uh, I guess so.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.159
Well, you know, Dusty,
it's a long trip from Houston.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.953
Why don't you come in
and have some ice tea and...?

07:34.036 --> 07:34.871
Cut!

07:36.831 --> 07:38.040
We need to reset from

07:38.124 --> 07:40.084
"I let some things slip
that mattered to me."

07:40.168 --> 07:41.252
We're getting too much glare

07:41.335 --> 07:42.628
from the skinny guy's sunglasses.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.881
What the heck's going on?

07:44.964 --> 07:47.049
I'm the star of my own reality show.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.843
You and I won't just be hanging out,

07:48.926 --> 07:50.887
we'll be doing it on TV.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.555
Finally!

07:59.479 --> 08:00.813
They are shooting

08:00.897 --> 08:02.482
a freakin' reality show!

08:02.565 --> 08:04.025
Did you get that?

08:04.108 --> 08:06.486
That was me discovering
you're shooting a reality show.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.488
This could be my big break!

08:08.571 --> 08:09.780
Bobby, get inside.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.824
Good lord, Dusty, did you run out

08:11.908 --> 08:13.784
of ways to embarrass yourself?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.912
No, this is going to be great, Hank.

08:15.995 --> 08:19.207
America wants reality,
and I'm the guy to give it to 'em.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.209
Buh! You sure are, Dust.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.461
Paul Portis, "ImPORTant Productions."

08:25.588 --> 08:26.631
He's the best.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.965
Check out the title for our show

08:28.049 --> 08:29.717
<i>Behind The Beard.</i>

08:29.800 --> 08:30.718
You're welcome.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.138
You think everything's fun
and games, Dusty.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.223
Well, it's not.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.350
Yeah, well, you might change your mind

08:37.433 --> 08:39.060
after you see your dog.

08:40.478 --> 08:42.438
Okay, that tears it!

08:42.522 --> 08:44.524
I am sick of you messing with me.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.155
Boy, I actually thought Dusty
might have changed,

08:51.239 --> 08:53.908
but he's just the same
flashy pain in my neck

08:53.991 --> 08:56.285
he used to be. What a joke.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.703
Joke?

08:57.787 --> 09:01.207
Did you see the way Bobby lit up
when he saw those cameras?

09:01.290 --> 09:03.000
I walked into his room this morning

09:03.084 --> 09:07.296
and he was... he was singing
into a hairbrush.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.466
Uh-huh, uh-huh! Go on!

09:10.550 --> 09:13.094
You know, sometimes
when things went wrong with Cotton,

09:13.177 --> 09:14.095
I just thought,

09:14.178 --> 09:16.222
"Well, at least I'm
getting that car one day."

09:16.305 --> 09:18.182
And now he just swoops in and takes it.

09:20.184 --> 09:22.144
Your joke made me sad.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.696
This is not interesting at all.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.823
We need something else!

09:33.906 --> 09:36.784
You should check this out!

09:36.867 --> 09:40.037
This guy doesn't get angry.
He becomes anger.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.872
It really pops.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.293
I'm gonna punch you silly.

09:45.376 --> 09:47.378
Gonna knock your teeth in, I tell you...

09:47.461 --> 09:49.005
You got-dang...

09:49.088 --> 09:51.215
That tears it!

09:51.299 --> 09:52.592
Watch the vein in his head.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.760
You could add jungle drums
each time it throbs.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.433
There's your act break,
people, and your bus-side,

10:00.516 --> 10:01.851
your grocery separator

10:01.934 --> 10:04.145
and your cover of <i>TV</i> frickin' <i>Guide</i>.

10:04.228 --> 10:05.479
This is our new job--

10:05.563 --> 10:07.607
pissing off Hank Hill.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.026
I'm gonna tear your beard off!

10:12.486 --> 10:16.532
People really respond to
your interacting with Hank.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.577
By "interacting" you mean
messing with him, right?

10:19.702 --> 10:23.748
Sometimes I think it's too easy,
but it's just so much dang fun.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.125
It's not just fun for you,
it's fun for us.

10:26.208 --> 10:27.376
It's fun for America.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.795
And most importantly, it's fun for Hank.

10:29.879 --> 10:33.215
Well, damn. If that's the case,
I know just the guys to help.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.637
How about we try that new soup place?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.847
Because it sure is soup weather.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.685
Hey, Hank.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.437
No.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.065
Don't worry, Hank.
We're just here selling buttfors.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.317
What's a butt...? No.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.029
You know, last time we saw you,

10:55.112 --> 10:57.073
you were trying to explain
to the Border Patrol

10:57.156 --> 10:59.158
why your trunk was full of tacos.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.535
I just want to apologize
for any hard feelings

11:01.619 --> 11:02.620
about the show, Hank,

11:02.787 --> 11:05.164
so we brought over
one of our gold records...

11:05.247 --> 11:07.416
and buried it somewhere in your lawn.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.668
What the hell?

11:12.838 --> 11:14.882
Wait for us! We're in!

11:15.466 --> 11:17.760
Dang it, Dusty, I'm gonna take
that gold record

11:17.843 --> 11:19.845
and shove your face
through the little hole!

11:21.430 --> 11:23.474
-Let's go!
-Holy...

11:25.017 --> 11:25.851
No!

11:28.688 --> 11:29.897
My lawn!

11:31.565 --> 11:32.733
Hey, Hank.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.905
Run! Hillbilly go crazy!

11:47.373 --> 11:49.542
Shh!

11:49.625 --> 11:51.502
Queen bee barbecue.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.963
Now serving shrimps.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.631
What the...?

11:59.677 --> 12:02.471
Although Hank's urethra
isn't technically blocked,

12:02.555 --> 12:04.390
-it's just narrow.
-Peggy,

12:04.473 --> 12:05.433
get them out of here!

12:05.516 --> 12:07.309
My house is off-limits!

12:07.393 --> 12:09.061
Wait a minute. Where's Bobby?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.896
He's fine. He's in the truth booth.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.440
Oh, God!

12:13.315 --> 12:14.942
Let me through. I need to get in there.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.485
Hey, I'm next!

12:16.569 --> 12:19.363
Dale, move aside unless
you want me to kick your ass.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.449
Yes, do it!

12:21.532 --> 12:22.992
That's how I'll get on TV!

12:23.075 --> 12:25.911
No, kick mine!
I want to be on camera, please!

12:25.995 --> 12:28.122
I believe I'm the one
who deserves the kicking.

12:28.205 --> 12:30.916
I slept with his best friend's
wife for 13 years.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.419
Yeah, Bill's wife was a tramp. Big deal.

12:33.502 --> 12:37.131
Now shut up and let Hank
kick the ass he started on!

12:38.382 --> 12:42.178
So Jerry Lee, Jimmy Swaggart
and me are ready for action

12:42.261 --> 12:44.263
-when who should appear but...
-Whee!

12:44.346 --> 12:47.224
Do it again! Do it again!

12:47.308 --> 12:49.477
Stop spinning my son!

12:50.311 --> 12:52.772
All right, that does it.
I want everybody out.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.607
You with the camera, everyone.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.775
But not me, right?

12:55.858 --> 12:56.734
Get!

13:00.112 --> 13:01.572
So you kicked 'em all out?

13:01.655 --> 13:03.032
I guess they deserved it.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.201
Dang right, they deserved it.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.038
I can't believe you gave
this car to Dusty, Dad.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.415
After all the times I've detailed it

13:11.499 --> 13:13.459
and all the tune-ups I've given it.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.671
I guess I didn't realize
how much Marlena meant to you.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.590
Well, how could you not know that?

13:19.673 --> 13:22.092
Well, sometimes I don't think, boy.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.390
Aw, Dad.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.564
Oh, got-dang it, you're in on this, too?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.609
Just having some fun, Hank!

13:38.692 --> 13:40.402
Something you don't know nothing about.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.656
While you were wasting time
having a family

13:43.739 --> 13:47.243
and buying a house and having a career,

13:47.326 --> 13:50.246
Dusty was busy making
something out of his life.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.206
Why didn't you join a band, boy?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.920
This footage is great,

13:58.003 --> 14:00.172
but we need to push the envelope with him.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.423
Think, think, think.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.801
He really hates code violations.

14:03.884 --> 14:05.594
We could make fun of propane.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.390
Propane? Whoa, you can
only push a man so far.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.891
We've been riding Hank pretty hard.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.435
Now let's lay off him
and do something else fun.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.354
I've said it once, I'll say it again.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.439
Me and the guys could always get naked.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.941
Uh, sure, sure.

14:19.024 --> 14:19.984
All good ideas.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.237
I'll confab with the team here
to see if we can find something golden.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.202
We can't lay off Hank.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.370
He's our bread and butter.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.329
You find anything?

14:32.413 --> 14:33.497
Oh, yeah.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.457
I can't believe

14:35.541 --> 14:37.543
you gave this car to Dusty, Dad.

14:37.626 --> 14:40.421
After all the times
I've detailed it, and all

14:40.504 --> 14:42.339
<i>the tune-ups I've given it...</i>

14:45.342 --> 14:47.344
We hurt the Caddy, we hurt Hank. Go!

14:47.428 --> 14:49.471
Do a cross-promotion thing
with Burger King

14:49.555 --> 14:51.724
and crash it into a replica
of the Eiffel Tower

14:51.807 --> 14:52.892
made out of Whoppers.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.560
We could set it on fire.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.603
On <i>Mommy versus Nanny,</i>

14:55.686 --> 14:58.355
any time we burned things,
we got an instant ten share.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.358
The 18-34 crowd really
loves a good explosion.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.861
I got a better idea.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.779
We'll do all three.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.702
So Dusty took the car back
to Houston already, huh?

15:11.785 --> 15:13.579
No. The car's at the shop.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.123
They're reinforcing the gas tank
and removing the radiator.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.708
Well, that is idiotic.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.585
These old V-8s run hot.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.420
It'll seize up in a few hundred miles.

15:21.503 --> 15:22.713
Doesn't need to last that long.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.882
Dusty's driving it in a demolition derby.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.929
Demolition derby? No!

15:37.227 --> 15:38.520
We gotta stop this.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.149
I will not let Dusty demolish
the car I grew up in.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.109
And the trunk I grew up in!

15:44.193 --> 15:46.862
My God, I've always dreamed
of driving somewhere

15:46.946 --> 15:48.739
to stop something bad from happening

15:48.822 --> 15:50.324
and now I'm doing it!

15:58.791 --> 16:00.292
Hello, Arlen!

16:00.376 --> 16:02.336
Are you ready to dirty?

16:06.590 --> 16:08.258
Hey!

16:11.303 --> 16:13.931
Hey, we're gonna go scout
the talent in the crowd.

16:21.605 --> 16:22.940
This is it, people!

16:23.023 --> 16:25.025
Here comes our gorgeous, angry monkey.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.528
Camera one, I want you
close on his neck vein.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.072
Camera two, you're on his
shaking fists and spittle.

16:30.155 --> 16:33.117
If something inside his brain pops,
I want to see it!

16:35.536 --> 16:37.371
Oh, good, Dusty's not out there yet.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.498
Maybe I can still save the car.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.501
Good Lord.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.631
It looks like a giant toilet seat cover.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.299
So soft...

16:49.383 --> 16:50.718
yet so powerful.

16:51.468 --> 16:52.720
Hey, Hank!

16:58.350 --> 17:00.269
It's like he doesn't even care

17:00.352 --> 17:02.062
that those tires are whitewalls.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.567


17:40.726 --> 17:43.687
Dusty! Quick, you gotta
get out of there! Come on!

17:46.023 --> 17:47.024
He's trapped.

17:47.107 --> 17:50.027
Someone's gotta get him out of there
before the car explodes.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.780
The car that you love the most
in the world is being destroyed.

17:52.863 --> 17:53.989
How does that make you feel?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.200
And could you please repeat
the question in your answer?

17:56.283 --> 17:59.953
Put those got-dang cameras
down and help him! Come on!

18:07.377 --> 18:09.129
Help!

18:09.213 --> 18:10.589
I'm all tangled up!

18:13.050 --> 18:14.384
Get me outta here.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.469
"Get me outta here?"

18:15.552 --> 18:17.137
Somebody give Dusty a better line!

18:17.221 --> 18:18.764
"Don't let this car be my coffin"?

18:18.847 --> 18:20.140
Uh, "Gimme all your helpin'!"

18:20.224 --> 18:22.226
"I've got legs, but
I don't know if I can use them!"

18:23.352 --> 18:24.561
Hang in there, Dusty.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.896
I'll get you outta there.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.069
Everything's gonna be okay.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.414
You all right, Dusty?

18:44.498 --> 18:45.707
Nuh... Uh...

18:46.750 --> 18:48.919
Oh, I guess not.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.673
Oh, my God.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.091
You know what, Dusty?

18:54.174 --> 18:55.634
I'm glad you're okay,

18:55.717 --> 18:57.928
but I don't ever want to see you again.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.139
I'm tired of your stupid pranks,
and I'm tired

19:00.222 --> 19:03.934
of your got-dang rock 'n' roll,
anything-goes lifestyle.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.146
Why are you mad? I'm the one
with the injured beard.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.438
You call that angry?

19:08.522 --> 19:10.440
This is supposed to be our promo moment.

19:10.524 --> 19:11.733
Look at that car!

19:13.902 --> 19:16.029
Think about all the times
you tuned it up, Hank,

19:16.113 --> 19:17.489
and tenderly washed it.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.866
You loved that car!

19:18.949 --> 19:20.784
Doesn't it make you want to punch Dusty

19:20.868 --> 19:22.452
with your upstage hand?!

19:22.536 --> 19:23.495
Hank, wait!

19:24.997 --> 19:27.332
Did that Caddy really
mean that much to you?!

19:27.416 --> 19:29.751
As much as your beard means to you.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.795
Oh... I'm sorry, Hank.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.840
I assumed when Cotton gave
the Caddy to me so quickly,

19:34.923 --> 19:36.592
and for free, you didn't want it.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.635
Yeah, well, Cotton...

19:39.178 --> 19:40.429
he's a jackass.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.599
And you knew about this?

19:43.682 --> 19:45.309
After I told you to lay off Hank,

19:45.392 --> 19:47.269
you set up this whole thing?

19:47.352 --> 19:49.938
That does it, Portis--
your show is canceled.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.191
You don't tell me
when the show is canceled,

19:52.274 --> 19:53.108
the network does.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.902
I've got contracts with you.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.863
Paper can be ripped... like your head.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.865
We're at a demolition derby in Texas.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.659
You want me to tell these
folks you're from Hollywood?

20:02.743 --> 20:05.204
You've seen what we've done
to Hank, and we like him.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.706
You best watch your back, son.

20:07.789 --> 20:09.166
Fine, do what you want.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.793
VH-1 Classics is swarming with bands

20:11.877 --> 20:13.420
who'll eat anything I ask them to.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.635
I'm sorry about the car.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.803
Well, I'm sorry about the beard.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.432
Ah, she'll grow back.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.392
Your beard's a girl?

20:29.978 --> 20:32.064
Well, thanks for fixing her up for me.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.149
It's the least I could do, 'cuz.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.360
So, Dusty, I was wondering...

20:36.443 --> 20:38.820
when you guys are ready to go on tour,

20:38.904 --> 20:41.657
do you think maybe I could go with you?

20:43.533 --> 20:45.118
We'd love to have you, Bobby,

20:45.202 --> 20:46.995
but if you want to succeed
in show business,

20:47.079 --> 20:48.497
you gotta stay in school.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.416
Rock 'n' roll takes a lot
of hard work and smarts.

20:51.500 --> 20:56.296
You gotta know a lot of stuff,
like, um, uh... arithmetic.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.423
And earth science.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.008
And the presidents.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.971
Man, I thought being a rock star
would be more fun than that.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.597
Nuh-uh.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.729
-<i>It's time to rock.</i>
