WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:01.351
I don't wanna die.

00:01.354 --> 00:03.137
Previously, on "Happy!"...

00:04.531 --> 00:06.403
I serve at your pleasure, Mr. Bug.

00:06.406 --> 00:09.341
They are important gifts
for important people,

00:09.343 --> 00:11.898
and I expect them to
be bright and shining

00:11.901 --> 00:13.614
under the tree Christmas morning.

00:13.617 --> 00:15.748
Cal was taken from a Sonny Shine event.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.216
And so was Hailey, I get it.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.884
One of those kids is mine.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.452
So, you're gonna make a call

00:20.454 --> 00:22.354
and you're gonna deliver her to me,

00:22.356 --> 00:24.406
midnight, tonight, your house.

00:24.409 --> 00:25.942
- Where's Hailey?
- Where's Mikey?

00:25.945 --> 00:27.559
Anyone wanna guess what this is, then?

00:27.561 --> 00:29.401
I let go of my finger and, well,

00:29.404 --> 00:30.404
there goes the neighborhood,

00:30.406 --> 00:31.665
including your precious password

00:31.667 --> 00:33.532
and if you give two
shits, your wife and kid.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.534
Mikey is not in the trunk.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.969
Fuck.

00:36.971 --> 00:38.847
Okay, kill him.

00:38.850 --> 00:40.639
The only thing that
still even believes in me

00:40.641 --> 00:42.741
is my kid's imaginary friend.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.055
Nick, I'm here!

00:45.813 --> 00:46.979
Daddy!

00:50.684 --> 00:52.217
About to say is very difficult,

00:52.219 --> 00:53.752
and I'm only gonna say it once.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.154
I believe in you,

00:55.156 --> 00:57.484
'cause you and me, we've
got a job to finish.

00:57.487 --> 00:58.516
Jessica?

00:58.519 --> 00:59.937
She really is intoxicating,

00:59.940 --> 01:00.859
your mother.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.187
Lovely voice, real talent.

01:02.190 --> 01:04.797
She could've been really big.

01:04.799 --> 01:06.231
I love hearing you sing.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.200
It's time you stop protecting me.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.502
But now it's time for me to protect you.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.104
Mom?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.241
Ma? Come on. Mom?

02:38.159 --> 02:40.726
Sorry, McCarthy.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.898
You want a ride in the van?

02:42.901 --> 02:44.763
Left some takeout in
the backseat overnight,

02:44.765 --> 02:47.099
but we can crack a window if you want...

02:47.101 --> 02:48.467
No thanks.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.536
Just take her.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.738
Got something I gotta do.

03:03.150 --> 03:06.552
They are killing the shite
out of that motherfucker.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.720
Is that a table saw?

03:08.722 --> 03:10.622
It very well could be, yeah.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.990
Shit.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.243
New plan.

03:23.246 --> 03:25.941
Are you off your goddamn nut?

03:25.944 --> 03:28.140
You think you're just
gonna waltz on out of here

03:28.142 --> 03:30.209
like some Piccadilly on parade?

03:30.211 --> 03:33.712
I am waltzing on out of
here because right now,

03:33.714 --> 03:35.414
Nick Sax is bulletproof.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.251
You waste me,

03:39.253 --> 03:40.586
you waste the Missus,

03:40.588 --> 03:43.055
and the boogereating heir
to the porcelain throne.

03:43.057 --> 03:46.325
Now, which one of you dinks
wants to drop that Yule log

03:46.327 --> 03:49.821
on the boss's chest this
fine Christmas Eve?

03:49.824 --> 03:52.064
I'll drop that log, you motherfucker.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.699
Please!

03:53.701 --> 03:55.434
You lunatic, take me if you must, but...

03:55.436 --> 03:57.836
I must, because, I don't know,

03:57.838 --> 04:00.038
call me a stickler for tradition, but,

04:00.040 --> 04:01.840
I just think on Christmas,

04:01.842 --> 04:03.775
that families should be together.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.110
Am I right, or am I right?

04:05.112 --> 04:06.511
Dear God!

04:06.513 --> 04:07.829
We're literally about to die.

04:07.832 --> 04:09.043
Shh.

04:09.046 --> 04:10.679
Just keep smiling there, kitten,

04:10.682 --> 04:12.851
and pucker up that sphincter.

04:12.853 --> 04:16.421
'Cause Nick Sax shoots early and often.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.590
I'm satisfied.

04:51.592 --> 04:54.326
Now, wait a second.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.563
A gentleman.

04:58.565 --> 04:59.965
Get the hell off me!

04:59.967 --> 05:01.566
All right, your Mister and I

05:01.568 --> 05:03.016
have some unfinished business.

05:03.019 --> 05:05.604
Any idea where he scurried off to?

05:05.606 --> 05:07.673
What are you gonna do to him?

05:07.675 --> 05:11.009
In my work, I take a jazz approach...

05:11.011 --> 05:13.145
You know, strictly improv...

05:13.147 --> 05:15.747
But assume that once I'm done,

05:15.749 --> 05:18.116
he won't resemble your husband anymore.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.921
339 Cherry Blossom Court.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.324
His sister's house in Jersey.

05:25.326 --> 05:27.459
The car knows the way.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.594
Tell him I want a divorce.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.077
Best Christmas ever.

06:05.064 --> 06:07.816
That's right, baby, you eat.

06:08.683 --> 06:10.702
I remember that time you snuck out

06:10.704 --> 06:13.038
and stole the Benz...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.240
You wanted to show up at the club and

06:15.242 --> 06:17.642
impress the girls with a fancy car.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.678
Wanted to be a big shot,

06:19.680 --> 06:21.513
just like your brothers.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.482
Wait, no, no, no, Mikey, no, no.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.917
Ut det mihi cibum statim.

06:29.223 --> 06:32.224
What did Blue do to you?

06:32.226 --> 06:34.526
What did he do to you?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.697
Blue.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.703
Mikey.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.241
Mikey!

07:03.157 --> 07:05.390
Mikey!

07:19.573 --> 07:20.739
Good morning.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.840
Ooh...

07:23.170 --> 07:24.209
Gotcha.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.945
It's really you. Sonny Shine.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.281
Shine... Sheinberg, Louis J.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.951
Sonny Shine is for my fans
of all ages around the world.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.953
It's Christmas Eve, shouldn't you be out

07:34.955 --> 07:37.255
jousting other parents

07:37.257 --> 07:39.424
over the new Tickle Me Humperdonk?

07:39.426 --> 07:41.426
I got mine months ago.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.028
You'd have to be a fool not to see

07:43.030 --> 07:45.061
how those were gonna fly.

07:45.064 --> 07:48.600
My daughter, Hailey,
is your biggest fan.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.669
We once stood in line at 4:00 a.m.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.184
to get tickets to your studio audience.

07:52.186 --> 07:54.425
I think it was the
happiest day of her life.

07:54.428 --> 07:56.775
That tickles my heart.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.944
Nothing means more to me than...

07:58.946 --> 08:00.512
She was kidnapped

08:00.514 --> 08:03.006
four days ago at your Wishtacular.

08:05.551 --> 08:08.092
What a world.

08:08.341 --> 08:10.308
What a world.

08:14.019 --> 08:16.687
- My condolences.
- She wasn't the only one.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.330
Seven other children have gone missing

08:18.332 --> 08:20.765
within the last two weeks.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.102
And what can I do for you?

08:24.104 --> 08:26.404
There's a common thread
to all the kidnappings.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.740
All the children disappeared r...

08:28.742 --> 08:30.942
Around...

08:31.945 --> 08:33.611
You,

08:33.614 --> 08:35.580
your shows or appearances.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.784
And you...

08:39.785 --> 08:41.953
You thought you'd come here

08:41.955 --> 08:46.057
and ruin Sonny Shine's
Christmas by telling me this,

08:46.059 --> 08:48.894
in person.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.596
The police have been ineffectual.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.632
Worthless, really.

08:53.634 --> 08:57.034
But a man as visible, as
prominent as yourself...

08:57.037 --> 08:58.970
You could bring attention to this.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.139
- Resources.
- Resources.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.275
You want money, right?

09:03.277 --> 09:04.976
- Doesn't everybody?
- I...

09:04.978 --> 09:06.980
I want you to help shine a light.

09:06.983 --> 09:08.980
Eww.

09:08.982 --> 09:11.316
God, the letters I get

09:11.318 --> 09:13.886
blaming me for little retard Sally's

09:13.889 --> 09:15.687
pisspoor spelling test.

09:15.689 --> 09:19.324
Blaming me for Billy's sissy boy lisp.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.259
If I wanted to raise children,

09:21.261 --> 09:22.527
I'd...

09:22.529 --> 09:24.763
I don't, I don't know, I'd adopt some,

09:24.765 --> 09:28.233
but I don't wanna raise
your goddamn children.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.669
I wanna entertain them!

09:30.671 --> 09:32.530
Do you see the difference?

09:35.542 --> 09:37.075
Dude.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.214
I'm, I'm...

09:38.217 --> 09:40.011
I've been blending Ghee

09:40.013 --> 09:42.013
and MCT into my coffee,

09:42.015 --> 09:44.716
so I'm totally lit as fuck.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.651
Celebrity problems.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.689
It's not easy, what I do.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.360
Sometimes, I just need a release.

10:04.571 --> 10:07.672
Your breathing, it's very shallow.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.941
You know, it's totally normal,

10:09.943 --> 10:13.878
being in close proximity
to someone so famous.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.716
Your heart beats faster, you
get a little lightheaded.

10:17.718 --> 10:21.453
You know, when I was just a little kid,

10:21.455 --> 10:23.321
all I wanted to do was
sit on Dorothy's lap.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.789
I totally get it.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.925
I'd like to go now.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.694
You just, you got here, just...

10:29.696 --> 10:32.063
Please.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.069
For you and...

10:38.071 --> 10:39.871
Hai... it's Hailey.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.973
Hailey, right?

10:41.975 --> 10:45.110
If... no, no...

10:45.112 --> 10:49.481
When she decides to come home.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.419
Thank you.

11:12.873 --> 11:16.207
Don't let her leave the building.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.917
Come on, this way.

12:32.919 --> 12:34.886
Back in there! Come on.

12:35.956 --> 12:39.290
Be careful.

12:39.292 --> 12:42.160
Get out.

12:44.731 --> 12:47.065
I told him

12:47.067 --> 12:48.967
children are bad business.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.236
Messy, obnoxious,

12:51.238 --> 12:52.871
germridden little migraines

12:52.873 --> 12:54.548
not worth the aggravation.

12:55.626 --> 12:58.209
"I have my reasons," he says.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.379
"We all have to answer
to someone," he says.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.480
It's ridiculous,

13:02.482 --> 13:04.634
just a waste of my time.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.623
Did you know that I
can train an adult male

13:11.625 --> 13:14.058
to denounce every God
he's ever worshipped

13:14.060 --> 13:16.594
and squeal on all fours
like a hog to slaughter

13:16.596 --> 13:18.763
in under 24 hours?

13:18.765 --> 13:21.099
Because adults have been socialized

13:21.101 --> 13:22.600
into latent obedience.

13:22.602 --> 13:23.665
But you...

13:23.668 --> 13:25.209
Really enjoy hearing yourself talk,

13:25.212 --> 13:26.771
don't you, Mister?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.576
Well, look who doesn't have a gag.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.114
We located the car
a halfmile from here

13:36.116 --> 13:38.216
wrapped around telephone pole.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.552
It's a total loss,
no sign of any driver.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.921
My God, Mikey.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.023
Right.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.559
About that social media post...

13:47.561 --> 13:49.861
Your son has been dead
for 48 hours, ma'am.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.596
We got a hit and run situation

13:51.598 --> 13:53.313
with serious injuries outside.

13:53.316 --> 13:55.033
I'm gonna need a straight answer

13:55.035 --> 13:56.301
to who was behind that wheel,

13:56.303 --> 13:57.669
or we will haul the whole lot of you

13:57.671 --> 13:59.370
back to the station.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.698
Mr. Scaramucci.

14:04.701 --> 14:07.679
Aww, they got you boys
working on Christmas Eve.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.013
That's criminal.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.549
My sister has had

14:11.551 --> 14:14.619
a very difficult morning.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.956
Why don't you officers just run along?

14:17.958 --> 14:20.480
You can worry about the paperwork later.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.801
Where is he?

14:29.803 --> 14:31.469
Go to hell.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.408
Where is he?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.679
You think your guns are
gonna protect you now?

14:41.681 --> 14:44.549
I got something way more dangerous:

14:44.551 --> 14:47.051
A following.

14:47.053 --> 14:50.755
Yeah, 1.3 million,

14:50.757 --> 14:52.857
and I didn't have to buy 'em, baby.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.959
I can't wait for the whole world

14:54.961 --> 14:57.195
to see who you really are, brother.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.938
All right, all right,
have a little dignity.

14:59.941 --> 15:04.269
The same brother who sucked
his thumb till he was 11,

15:04.271 --> 15:09.107
who shat his shorts on the
Cyclone at Coney Island,

15:09.109 --> 15:11.776
who cried himself to sleep when the boys

15:11.778 --> 15:14.178
made fun of his sorry
excuse for a pecker.

15:15.849 --> 15:18.249
These mugs may fear you,

15:18.251 --> 15:19.684
but I don't,

15:19.686 --> 15:23.087
because I know all the secrets,

15:23.089 --> 15:25.356
and I have all the receipts.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.125
So, you better buy yourself

15:27.127 --> 15:29.360
a pair of paparazzi shades, boo,

15:29.362 --> 15:32.630
'cause you're about
to become very famous.

15:32.632 --> 15:33.798
Snap!

15:39.673 --> 15:41.906
Where...

15:44.311 --> 15:46.878
We're gonna tear this place apart

15:46.880 --> 15:48.313
until we find him.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.786
Michelangelo!

15:54.788 --> 15:57.555
It's Uncle Blue!

15:57.557 --> 16:00.191
Aww, come on, Mikey.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.993
Come on.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.661
Give me what is mine.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.064
Give me what I deserve,

16:06.066 --> 16:10.501
or mama's gonna get what she deserves.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.837
Don't you think that I won't do it.

17:49.853 --> 17:51.822
Nick?

17:51.825 --> 17:52.951
Yeah?

17:52.953 --> 17:55.586
I'm cold, so cold.

17:55.588 --> 17:57.388
Cuddle me?

17:59.559 --> 18:02.393
'Kay.

18:02.395 --> 18:04.162
Yeah.

18:08.001 --> 18:11.336
Ssstill cold.

18:11.338 --> 18:13.504
Cuddle me closer?

18:13.506 --> 18:14.906
Wh...

18:14.908 --> 18:16.240
What is it, Nick?

18:16.242 --> 18:17.542
Nothing.

18:17.544 --> 18:20.712
Just, just, seem...

18:20.714 --> 18:21.980
different.

18:21.982 --> 18:24.002
A little glint in your eye,

18:24.005 --> 18:26.539
kinda...

18:26.542 --> 18:29.053
Kinda Mansonesque.

18:29.055 --> 18:30.355
Did you...

18:30.357 --> 18:33.591
My God.

18:33.593 --> 18:35.326
You little scamp.

18:35.328 --> 18:37.595
You killed something, didn't you?

18:37.597 --> 18:38.963
Yeah, you did.

18:38.965 --> 18:40.431
I'd know that look anywhere.

18:40.433 --> 18:42.000
I don't wanna talk about it.

18:44.067 --> 18:47.171
Okay.

18:47.173 --> 18:49.440
All right, all right, look.

18:51.011 --> 18:52.844
Look, what can I tell you, pal?

18:52.846 --> 18:55.446
The first one...

18:55.448 --> 18:57.715
it's always gonna stay with you.

18:57.717 --> 18:59.517
You're always gonna remember it.

18:59.519 --> 19:01.386
Do... do you remember?

19:01.388 --> 19:02.820
Your first?

19:02.822 --> 19:04.188
Yeah, what the hell did I just say?

19:04.190 --> 19:06.090
Of course I...

19:10.130 --> 19:11.496
No.

19:11.498 --> 19:12.916
Maybe.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.733
Look, my point is this.

19:15.735 --> 19:18.770
That you just gotta hope

19:18.772 --> 19:22.907
that you did it for a reason.

19:22.909 --> 19:25.043
And I mean a good reason.

19:27.247 --> 19:30.281
And Hailey's a damn good reason.

19:30.283 --> 19:31.816
Can I tell you a secret?

19:31.818 --> 19:34.218
One I stinky pinky swore never to tell?

19:34.220 --> 19:35.337
What?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.655
When Hailey and I were
at the Sonny Shine show...

19:39.526 --> 19:41.059
The whole reason she snuck away

19:41.061 --> 19:42.897
was so Sonny could hear her wish.

19:43.778 --> 19:46.831
Her one wish she'd
waited her whole life.

19:49.739 --> 19:51.636
- Hailey's wish was...
- Hold that thought.

19:51.638 --> 19:53.771
I'm about to get a little road ragey.

19:53.773 --> 19:54.972
What the...

20:05.685 --> 20:08.119
I think we can agree
this one was not my fault.

20:16.629 --> 20:18.629
Officer, is there something wrong?

20:18.631 --> 20:22.200
What the hell are you
doing in Blue's car?

20:22.202 --> 20:24.535
You know, at a certain point,

20:24.537 --> 20:26.604
sticking your gun in my face,

20:26.606 --> 20:28.840
it's, you know... Kinda
loses its specialness.

20:28.842 --> 20:30.970
Laws of diminishing
returns and all that.

20:30.973 --> 20:32.357
I mean, you want me
to take you seriously,

20:32.359 --> 20:34.439
at some point you're gonna
have to pull that trigger.

20:35.482 --> 20:37.748
Aww, for crying out loud.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.984
Hey, hey, hey.

20:39.986 --> 20:43.321
Give me your keys, again.

20:43.323 --> 20:45.056
Let's do this.

20:45.058 --> 20:48.192
We get Blue, we get your kid.

20:48.194 --> 20:50.261
Listen to her, what is this we stuff?

20:50.263 --> 20:52.298
I didn't know, all right?

20:52.301 --> 20:54.232
There were a lot of things
I looked the other way,

20:54.234 --> 20:56.601
but the kids... I didn't know, Nick.

20:56.603 --> 20:59.170
You gotta fucking believe me. Nick?

20:59.172 --> 21:01.606
It's Amanda. Amanda?

21:01.608 --> 21:03.908
Merry, I'm in trouble.

21:03.910 --> 21:05.276
It's him, it's gotta be.

21:05.278 --> 21:06.428
Amanda, it's me.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.678
Where are you?

21:07.680 --> 21:10.715
Nick?

21:10.717 --> 21:13.084
He's got her, it's gotta be him.

21:13.086 --> 21:13.918
Who has her?

21:13.920 --> 21:15.553
Sonny Shine.

21:15.555 --> 21:17.006
She needs you.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.956
Amanda, listen to me.

21:18.958 --> 21:20.458
Amanda?

21:20.460 --> 21:21.572
Amanda?

21:22.672 --> 21:23.763
What the hell?

21:23.766 --> 21:25.141
What the hell's a Sonny Shine?

21:29.002 --> 21:30.998
He'd never hurt Hailey.

21:31.001 --> 21:33.137
He's got Shine Tower
58th and Lex, let's go.

21:33.139 --> 21:35.006
He doesn't live in a tower.

21:35.008 --> 21:37.308
Sonny lives in a
castle. I saw it myself.

21:37.310 --> 21:38.626
What, wait.

21:38.629 --> 21:39.695
What did you say?

21:39.698 --> 21:40.745
Hailey and I went there.

21:40.747 --> 21:41.646
Amanda took us.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.614
It was the best day ever.

21:43.616 --> 21:46.212
It's a great big building
with a great big gate.

21:46.215 --> 21:48.753
And there were lights,
and cameras, and...

21:48.755 --> 21:50.755
Lights and cameras?

21:55.828 --> 21:59.931
It was you.

21:59.933 --> 22:01.732
I didn't want it to be.

22:01.734 --> 22:05.236
I told myself lies not to believe it.

22:09.876 --> 22:13.678
Those spraytanned
apes were a disgrace...

22:13.680 --> 22:15.313
To apes.

22:15.315 --> 22:18.049
They threaded their eyebrows, Isa.

22:18.051 --> 22:21.009
They waxed their armpits.

22:21.012 --> 22:22.636
I needed gangsters,

22:22.639 --> 22:25.140
and you gave me Spandau Ballet.

22:27.780 --> 22:31.629
You think you know all the secrets?

22:31.631 --> 22:36.259
I have done things...

22:36.262 --> 22:41.772
Things that you couldn't
possibly imagine.

22:41.774 --> 22:43.360
I had no choice.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.409
But once I get that password,

22:45.411 --> 22:47.540
those days are over.

22:48.815 --> 22:51.148
I answer to no one.

22:53.686 --> 22:55.553
You gonna answer to that?

23:01.928 --> 23:03.794
I had a visit today

23:03.796 --> 23:06.197
from a mother looking for her daughter.

23:06.199 --> 23:08.342
I can give you eight good reasons

23:08.345 --> 23:09.800
why this makes me upset.

23:09.802 --> 23:11.798
I want them signed, sealed,

23:11.801 --> 23:14.538
and delivered tomorrow,
Christmas morning.

23:14.540 --> 23:16.240
And if they're not,

23:16.242 --> 23:18.709
it won't be me who gets exterminated!

23:23.116 --> 23:25.157
You came to me an unwashed,

23:25.160 --> 23:30.187
unkempt, motley assortment
of... God, who am I kidding?

23:30.189 --> 23:33.491
I cannot wait to get
rid of you petri dishes.

23:33.493 --> 23:36.861
Especially you.

23:36.863 --> 23:38.649
This is not the end of your journey,

23:38.652 --> 23:41.232
but the beginning, blah, blah, blah.

23:41.234 --> 23:43.901
You were plucked from obscurity
to serve a greater purpose,

23:43.903 --> 23:45.870
yadda, yadda, whatever.

23:45.872 --> 23:47.384
There were successes...

23:50.777 --> 23:52.977
And there were disasters.

23:55.014 --> 23:56.881
Congratulations, Kenji.

23:56.883 --> 24:00.251
You have achieved top
honors because you're Asian.

24:00.253 --> 24:02.553
And as a reward, you will go first.

24:02.555 --> 24:05.790
Your new parents will
be very, very proud,

24:05.792 --> 24:08.125
assuming you survive
the packaging process.

24:22.141 --> 24:24.241
Mister?

24:24.243 --> 24:26.210
What is it?

24:26.212 --> 24:28.879
I need to go to the bathroom.

24:28.881 --> 24:30.648
For God's sake.

24:30.650 --> 24:33.751
I told you to go before
we started packaging.

24:33.753 --> 24:36.120
Fine, go.

24:37.256 --> 24:39.557
There it is, Nick,

24:39.559 --> 24:41.737
home of the Rainbow Castle.

24:41.740 --> 24:42.927
Well, if that doesn't scream perv,

24:42.929 --> 24:44.362
I don't know what does.

24:44.365 --> 24:45.329
When I look at it,

24:45.331 --> 24:47.331
all I see is, "Let's play!"

24:47.333 --> 24:49.333
- Exactly.
- Look.

24:49.335 --> 24:52.503
Checking front entrance now.

24:52.505 --> 24:54.839
Is that normal for children's TV?

24:54.841 --> 24:56.941
You tell me, pops.

24:56.943 --> 24:58.342
Funny.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.581
All right, look,

25:03.583 --> 25:07.518
I gotta talk to this little, blue, um...

25:07.520 --> 25:08.819
Well, you keep saying that,

25:08.821 --> 25:11.088
but I've never seen one
with wings on its back

25:11.090 --> 25:12.423
and a thing coming out of it's...

25:12.425 --> 25:15.092
I mean, we call it a...

25:15.094 --> 25:16.660
Go on.

25:21.834 --> 25:23.434
All right, you, look at me.

25:23.436 --> 25:25.836
Happilocus Imaginus, Defender of Zork,

25:25.838 --> 25:27.326
First Knight of the Cupcake Kingdom,

25:27.329 --> 25:29.055
hero of the Frosting Wars.

25:29.058 --> 25:30.775
Reporting for duty, sir!

25:33.679 --> 25:36.881
She's counting on you.

25:36.883 --> 25:40.284
I'm counting on you.

25:40.286 --> 25:43.020
Go find Hailey.

25:45.825 --> 25:47.892
What?

25:57.371 --> 25:58.836
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

25:58.838 --> 25:59.832
all right, look.

25:59.842 --> 26:01.294
We got a big building here, so...

26:01.297 --> 26:02.199
Let's split up.

26:02.202 --> 26:03.409
I'll take the front.

26:03.412 --> 26:05.812
I'll take the back.

26:08.519 --> 26:09.647
You good?

26:09.649 --> 26:11.482
Yeah.

26:17.156 --> 26:18.681
You got this idea that your ex

26:18.684 --> 26:20.491
is some kind of wounded flower.

26:20.493 --> 26:23.145
Amanda's a goddamn pit bull,

26:23.148 --> 26:25.815
with one hell of a
right cross, by the way.

26:25.818 --> 26:27.331
She can take care of herself.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.341
Assunta, open the door.

26:39.812 --> 26:41.411
It's the Old Don's password.

26:41.414 --> 26:43.387
Mikey has it and he's
going to give it to Blue.

26:52.489 --> 26:53.588
Okay.

26:53.591 --> 26:54.591
Wait, what?

26:57.497 --> 26:59.597
Yes, yes, that's why we must stop him.

26:59.599 --> 27:00.731
Open the door, please.

27:03.603 --> 27:05.469
Okay, all right.

27:05.471 --> 27:08.038
Mamma...

27:10.209 --> 27:14.111
Nonna...

27:14.113 --> 27:18.649
Bisnonna...

27:18.651 --> 27:20.518
I should've never let
Mikey get on that plane.

27:20.520 --> 27:22.052
I just wanted him to have a good...

27:22.054 --> 27:23.587
Shh!

27:28.160 --> 27:29.426
No talisman.

27:38.604 --> 27:40.938
Hee.

27:40.940 --> 27:42.840
Talisman.

27:44.944 --> 27:50.080
So, as the thread weaves a tapestry

27:50.082 --> 27:52.917
of space and time,

27:52.919 --> 27:55.920
so does your brother's soul

27:55.922 --> 27:57.821
unwind.

28:00.526 --> 28:03.260
That is not a talisman.

28:03.262 --> 28:06.430
That is a ball of yarn.

28:06.432 --> 28:07.665
Talisman.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.315
That is a cat toy.

28:09.318 --> 28:10.378
Talisman!

28:10.381 --> 28:12.970
After 20 years

28:12.972 --> 28:15.372
of tithes and offerings

28:15.374 --> 28:17.041
and defending you,

28:17.043 --> 28:18.309
this is all you've got for me?

28:18.311 --> 28:19.610
A cat toy?

28:19.612 --> 28:21.979
And after all these years,

28:21.981 --> 28:24.548
you lost your faith?

28:24.550 --> 28:28.452
This is more about you

28:28.454 --> 28:30.354
than about me.

28:53.846 --> 28:56.046
"Who are you looking for?"

28:56.048 --> 28:58.983
Shine, Shine, Shine...

29:41.227 --> 29:43.093
Keep loading.

29:43.095 --> 29:45.295
I have something I need to take care of.

30:03.282 --> 30:05.482
Hailey!

30:05.484 --> 30:08.485
Hailey!

30:08.487 --> 30:11.088
Presents.

30:11.090 --> 30:13.123
What the?

31:56.796 --> 31:59.229
Sit up straight.

31:59.231 --> 32:02.332
Eat your vegetables.

32:02.334 --> 32:06.870
Put down that smartphone or tablet.

32:06.872 --> 32:09.239
The common refrain of the
typical American parent.

32:09.241 --> 32:11.408
Smoothie.

32:11.410 --> 32:13.677
Time to dance, bitch.

32:14.647 --> 32:17.281
Of course it does.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.749
But did you listen?

32:18.751 --> 32:20.918
No, you didn't,

32:20.920 --> 32:22.920
and now here we are.

32:22.922 --> 32:25.522
Starting today, your little lives

32:25.524 --> 32:28.125
will change in ways you
could never have imagined.

32:28.127 --> 32:30.027
There will be moments
when you will wonder

32:30.029 --> 32:32.696
what you have done to deserve these...

33:00.103 --> 33:01.869
Nightynight.

33:12.310 --> 33:13.491
What the hell is this?

33:13.494 --> 33:16.440
I saw you, you were just standing there,

33:16.443 --> 33:17.627
fingering yourself.

33:17.630 --> 33:19.651
Why is this truck still here?

33:19.653 --> 33:21.453
It's all loaded up, Mr. Scaramucci.

33:21.455 --> 33:22.588
We heard gunshots.

33:22.590 --> 33:23.589
Smoothie said that...

33:23.591 --> 33:25.557
Smoothie said?

33:25.559 --> 33:27.292
Smoothie...

33:27.294 --> 33:28.460
Where is he?

33:44.545 --> 33:46.578
Smile.

33:46.580 --> 33:48.747
Fuck you.

33:52.486 --> 33:54.653
I knew this day would come.

33:54.655 --> 33:57.823
Our destiny is in the stars.

33:57.825 --> 33:59.991
You do see that, Sax, don't you?

33:59.994 --> 34:01.927
You're not gonna ask
me my sign, are you?

34:01.929 --> 34:04.029
The universe, it conspired

34:04.031 --> 34:05.697
to bring us back together again

34:05.699 --> 34:08.867
so that a movable
object could finally meet

34:08.869 --> 34:11.054
irresistible force.

34:12.172 --> 34:13.572
Which one am I?

34:16.377 --> 34:17.743
The dumb one.

34:19.495 --> 34:23.882
Now, I have been thinking a lot lately

34:23.884 --> 34:27.719
about what I would do if
our paths ever crossed again.

34:27.721 --> 34:28.786
That makes two of us.

34:28.789 --> 34:30.355
See? See?

34:30.357 --> 34:33.292
It's destiny.

34:33.293 --> 34:35.460
Clearly,

34:35.463 --> 34:37.795
you are a man

34:37.797 --> 34:40.966
who must be broken.

34:40.967 --> 34:42.668
I am?

34:42.670 --> 34:45.204
But...

34:45.206 --> 34:48.318
What is pain to someone like you?

34:48.321 --> 34:51.389
What is death to someone like you?

34:51.391 --> 34:55.013
That is a very curious problem.

34:55.014 --> 34:56.248
Vexing.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.317
You have disarmed me, Sax.

34:58.319 --> 35:01.220
All of my usual weapons,
they just seem so inadequate.

35:01.222 --> 35:03.422
And my tried and true methods,

35:03.424 --> 35:05.324
they seem so...

35:05.326 --> 35:07.693
well...

35:07.695 --> 35:09.194
impotent.

35:09.196 --> 35:10.662
Torture, murder...

35:10.664 --> 35:11.697
They're hobbies.

35:11.699 --> 35:12.798
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

35:12.800 --> 35:15.868
All trifles to a man
who would cheerfully

35:15.870 --> 35:18.203
die in agony.

35:21.375 --> 35:23.842
I am going to show you something

35:23.844 --> 35:26.211
that I bet you never thought you'd see.

35:28.749 --> 35:33.185
I am going to show you
why they call me Smoothie.

35:33.187 --> 35:34.920
But I wasn't curious.

35:34.922 --> 35:36.421
Let's not do this.

35:36.423 --> 35:38.257
You don't need to do that, let's, no...

35:38.259 --> 35:39.691
Let's just put that right back on.

35:39.693 --> 35:41.093
- Just...
- Yeah, no.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.594
Aww, fuck me.

35:56.377 --> 35:58.810
Holy shit.

35:58.812 --> 36:00.646
Yikes, ugly lady.

36:00.648 --> 36:02.214
It's not nice to sneak up on people.

36:02.216 --> 36:03.749
Come on, I found Hailey.

36:03.751 --> 36:05.551
The bad guys are loading
the kids on a truck.

36:05.553 --> 36:07.505
Now, let's grab Nick
before it's too late.

36:07.508 --> 36:08.820
Where are you going?

36:08.822 --> 36:09.888
The wrong way, that's where.

36:09.890 --> 36:11.145
Nick is this way.

36:11.148 --> 36:12.661
I know because he believes in me,

36:12.664 --> 36:14.075
it's like a homing signal,

36:14.078 --> 36:15.369
llike in that movie,

36:15.372 --> 36:16.713
where the iguana phones home.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.497
Remember? Beep, beep, beep, beep.

36:21.602 --> 36:22.801
There we go.

36:24.271 --> 36:27.239
No, this way, this way, this way.

36:27.241 --> 36:29.608
Dumb as a soup sandwich.

36:32.479 --> 36:35.747
This way, this way.

36:35.749 --> 36:37.015
You're almost there, just...

36:37.017 --> 36:39.017
No, do...

36:39.019 --> 36:40.619
Yes, go, go, go, go!

36:49.330 --> 36:50.963
Are you cozy?

37:03.611 --> 37:05.177
Sax,

37:05.179 --> 37:07.045
relax.

37:15.322 --> 37:18.657
I am become destroyer of worlds!

37:18.659 --> 37:22.127
I will destroy your
world, you motherfucker!

37:22.129 --> 37:24.549
No!

37:24.552 --> 37:26.652
Yes! Yes!

37:26.655 --> 37:27.966
Damn you!

37:42.443 --> 37:44.516
Nick! Holy guacamole, Nick!

37:44.518 --> 37:45.817
That was close, buddy.

37:45.819 --> 37:47.096
We got here just...

37:47.099 --> 37:48.165
In the...

37:48.168 --> 37:51.269
In the nick of...

37:51.272 --> 37:53.558
Jelly beans.

37:57.907 --> 37:59.606
Get it out of me.

38:05.641 --> 38:07.341
Okay, take 'em.

38:19.622 --> 38:21.922
It's gone, the truck just left.

38:21.924 --> 38:23.157
It just left.

38:23.159 --> 38:24.958
Good boy, remember,

38:24.960 --> 38:26.994
those presents better be deliver...

38:26.996 --> 38:29.496
They'll be there!

38:52.888 --> 38:55.823
Mr. Scaramucci,

38:55.825 --> 38:57.524
are you all right?

39:02.064 --> 39:03.997
What am I?

39:06.869 --> 39:08.836
What the hell am I?

39:08.838 --> 39:10.504
You...

39:10.506 --> 39:12.306
You're the boss.

39:13.709 --> 39:16.810
I'm the boss of nothing.

39:16.812 --> 39:19.713
I'm...

39:19.715 --> 39:22.916
I'm an errand boy for psychopaths.

39:26.188 --> 39:29.156
Look, don't say that, Mr. Scaramucci.

39:35.431 --> 39:38.031
If I had that password...

39:39.768 --> 39:41.902
If I only had that goddamn passwo...

39:56.418 --> 39:58.952
Truck, Nick! The truck's getting away!

40:24.647 --> 40:26.213
Fuck.

41:05.020 --> 41:06.987
Hailey!

41:10.960 --> 41:12.926
Nick, hurry!

41:16.298 --> 41:17.798
Hailey!

41:17.800 --> 41:19.466
Hailey!

41:39.921 --> 41:42.822
We're too late, she's gone.

41:50.566 --> 41:53.054
Good, you two have met.
