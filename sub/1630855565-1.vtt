Oh.

05:08.525 --> 05:10.397
<i>All right.</i>

05:10.484 --> 05:13.965

05:14.052 --> 05:15.010
No, I don't...

05:15.315 --> 05:17.360
Benson, you are cleaning
the dining room today.

05:17.534 --> 05:20.015
Jess will be on drive-through.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.886
Bradley, front window.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.715
Chris, you're in
the kitchen with me.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.891
Mm.
- Chris?

05:26.978 --> 05:27.892
Chris?

05:28.371 --> 05:31.505
- W... What?
I'm talking to you
is what.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.509
Get your dick out of your ear
and listen when I'm talking.

05:35.987 --> 05:37.946
All right?
Your work's been shit lately.

05:38.599 --> 05:40.078
For fuck's sake,
there's still...

05:40.165 --> 05:41.210
there's still food

05:41.558 --> 05:43.691
under the heat lamp
from you closing last night.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.215
My bad.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.434
Yeah, it is your bad.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.566
It sure is.

05:49.653 --> 05:52.787
It's also fucking unsanitary
and it's fucking disgusting.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.227
Right?

05:59.533 --> 06:02.274
Meeting adjourned.
Let's get it started.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.582
Business as usual, all right?
Move, move, move.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.456
Bradley. Hey. Hang tight.
Come see. I want to talk to you.

06:10.239 --> 06:11.414
My office.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.073
Sit down. Just...

06:22.338 --> 06:23.339
Uh...

06:23.992 --> 06:25.776
What's your last name, Bradley?

06:27.517 --> 06:28.605
It's Bradley.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.215
What?

06:30.694 --> 06:32.348
Uh. Bradley's my last name.

06:33.436 --> 06:34.524
Then what's your first name?

06:34.785 --> 06:35.612
Randy.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.702
How come your name tag
says "Bradley"?

06:39.790 --> 06:42.314
Mm. Well, you gave it
to me.

06:43.925 --> 06:44.882
Huh.

06:47.145 --> 06:48.320
All right, listen, Bradley.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.235
You've been here,
what, a year now?

06:50.671 --> 06:52.107
Uh. Yeah, I guess so.

06:52.673 --> 06:53.674
You like it?

06:56.111 --> 06:59.114
What are your...
plans for the future?

07:00.594 --> 07:01.856
What do you mean?

07:02.247 --> 07:03.771
What do you want to do?

07:04.162 --> 07:06.382
Um...

07:08.950 --> 07:10.473
You taking
any classes now?

07:11.126 --> 07:13.041
Uh. Community college,
something like that?

07:13.128 --> 07:14.216
Not really, no.

07:17.698 --> 07:18.525
Okay.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.617
Right.

07:26.358 --> 07:28.883
Fuck it. Look,
these pricks here,

07:28.970 --> 07:30.624
they don't give two shits
about what we do.

07:30.798 --> 07:31.668
All right?

07:32.016 --> 07:33.322
But I see you,

07:34.366 --> 07:35.498
and you don't fit in.

07:37.065 --> 07:39.502
You do what I say.
You don't talk back.

07:39.850 --> 07:42.070
You do shit around here
I wouldn't even do.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.029
So let me ask you...

07:47.031 --> 07:49.164
Why do you work
so fucking hard at this job?

07:51.862 --> 07:52.994
I-- I... I don't...

07:53.777 --> 07:55.736
-  I don't know.
- Look.

07:58.956 --> 08:03.308
I got some scoop on a new spot
opening up west of Reading.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.355
They're gonna be opening
some manager positions.

08:07.443 --> 08:08.879
I could put in
a good word for you.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.100
This... this is not some
charity bullshit, okay?

08:12.535 --> 08:14.668
I recommend someone
halfway decent,

08:14.755 --> 08:15.799
it makes me look good.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.019
I recommend some fuckup
that loses their shit,

08:18.106 --> 08:20.238
quits after two months,
I get reamed up the ass.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.544
- Know what I'm saying?
- Okay. Yeah.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.067
So...

08:23.981 --> 08:25.374
I need to know
what you want to do.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.681
Oh, um...

08:28.638 --> 08:29.944
W-- Well, I guess--

08:30.031 --> 08:31.249
I don't need
an answer right now.

08:31.554 --> 08:32.642
- Yeah?
Yeah.

08:32.729 --> 08:33.600
Think it over.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.819
Got it?[BREATHES DEEPLY] Yeah.

08:35.906 --> 08:36.820

08:44.001 --> 08:44.915
Thank you.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.439
Close the goddamn door.
Sorry.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.020

back there, huh?

09:03.325 --> 09:04.500

- Mm-mm.

09:43.234 --> 09:47.325

- Boyfriend?

10:57.091 --> 10:59.136
Come on, Bradley,
tell me what's on your mind.

11:02.226 --> 11:04.359
Did you ask a girl out
and she turned you down?

11:05.752 --> 11:07.623
Told you she'd never fuck
a loser like you?

11:07.710 --> 11:09.451
Can you please
just knock it off?

11:12.802 --> 11:14.282
Sure, buddy. I'll knock it off.

11:15.109 --> 11:16.719

11:19.809 --> 11:20.897

11:21.202 --> 11:23.900
Eat this burger,
and then I'll shut up.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.251
Come on. Eat the burger.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.166
Then you won't hear shit
the rest of the day.

11:34.911 --> 11:35.738

11:37.392 --> 11:38.654
Hmm?

11:39.916 --> 11:40.874

11:41.918 --> 11:43.006
What?

11:45.661 --> 11:47.054
You should stop now.

11:48.925 --> 11:49.926
Chris, don't.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.886
Benson.

11:54.452 --> 11:55.976
Why do you fucking care?

11:59.370 --> 12:00.763
Because you made your point.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.157
You made it a while ago.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.463
And now you're just
being a dick.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.423
I've never had
a problem with you.

12:09.032 --> 12:11.165

what I can

12:11.252 --> 12:13.254
and cannot fucking do,

12:14.081 --> 12:15.909
I will have no problem
turning your peaceful

12:16.039 --> 12:20.217
redneck existence
into a living hell.

12:21.175 --> 12:22.480
Do we understand each other?

12:28.530 --> 12:29.444
Sure.

12:31.968 --> 12:32.969
Good to hear.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.930

Chris, no.

Hey, where were you, buddy?

15:20.528 --> 15:21.659
What the fuck is go...

15:32.235 --> 15:33.193
Stop!

15:38.894 --> 15:40.852
What are you planning
on doing back there, Hardy?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.768
Please don't...
don't... don't do this.

16:05.834 --> 16:09.751
Hey.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.231
Shit.

16:12.710 --> 16:13.929

Take a leg.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.222

Fucking move.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.291
Goddamn.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.041
Where's your phone?

19:34.564 --> 19:35.478
In my jacket.

20:11.035 --> 20:11.949
Go.

20:13.603 --> 20:14.517
Walk.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.706
Move all that shit
out the front seat.

20:36.191 --> 20:38.498

a hundred times by now.

Next shift starts at 2:00.
It's 8:30 now.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.628
That's five and a half hours
before anybody gets inside.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.020
That is assuming, of course,

21:23.107 --> 21:25.414
some potential customer
doesn't fucking freak

21:25.501 --> 21:27.242
'cause they can't get
their curly fry fix,

21:27.329 --> 21:28.896
they break a window

21:29.897 --> 21:31.290
So chances are,

21:31.551 --> 21:34.075
five and a half hours

She may call headquarters,
may call the cops.

21:51.440 --> 21:52.615

21:54.965 --> 21:57.011

figure out what to do

Let's get something to eat.

22:32.612 --> 22:34.483
<i>♪ Useless for a suicide ♪</i>

22:39.923 --> 22:41.055
Put that on.

23:01.641 --> 23:02.642
Take a seat.

23:06.123 --> 23:07.995
Here you go.

23:08.082 --> 23:08.996
Thank you.

23:14.131 --> 23:16.133
This uh... egg dish?
Mm-hmm?

23:16.220 --> 23:18.222
What is that?
Oh,
that's the specialty.

23:21.312 --> 23:24.011
All righty...

23:26.274 --> 23:29.320
Benson.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.540
Why are we here?

23:32.541 --> 23:33.412
Hmm?

23:34.456 --> 23:35.588
Wh... why...

23:36.458 --> 23:38.068
Why are... are you doing this?

23:40.593 --> 23:41.594
What do you mean?

23:45.075 --> 23:46.337
Oh, you mean like...

23:50.037 --> 23:51.691
Wondering when you were
gonna ask me that.

23:52.082 --> 23:54.607
What can I get for you gentlemen
this fine morning?

23:54.694 --> 23:55.999
Well...

23:57.044 --> 23:58.785
Marsha...

23:58.872 --> 24:01.744
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha,
uh, I got a question for you.

24:02.049 --> 24:05.922
Does the short stack
come with hash browns?

24:06.009 --> 24:07.184
No, just toast.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.709
That's a shame.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.885
- But the omelets do?
- Correct, sir.

24:11.972 --> 24:14.148
Okay. Well, then
it's gonna be a, uh,

24:14.235 --> 24:16.150
western omelet
kind of morning for me.

24:16.237 --> 24:19.632
And for Mister...

24:23.157 --> 24:25.028
Bradley, what is your last name?

24:25.420 --> 24:26.595
It's Bradley.

24:27.030 --> 24:29.598
Your name
is "Bradley Bradley"?

24:30.730 --> 24:33.602
No, my last--
My first name is Randy.

24:33.689 --> 24:34.864
Randy?

24:34.951 --> 24:37.824
Well, two first names,
that's really special.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.001
It's very special, Randy.

24:42.568 --> 24:43.873
Uh. What are you eating?

24:44.570 --> 24:45.571
Um...

24:46.049 --> 24:47.486
I'm fine, thanks.

24:49.139 --> 24:51.098
You know what, let's just
get him a cinnamon bun.

24:51.185 --> 24:52.578
He can snack on that.

24:52.665 --> 24:55.494
Western omelet, cinnamon bun.
Coming right up.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.234
Thanks.

24:57.321 --> 24:58.453
Actually, you know what?
Hold up.

24:58.714 --> 25:00.716
I got another question
for you, Marsha.

25:00.977 --> 25:01.935
Shoot.

25:04.459 --> 25:05.678
How long have you worked here?

25:06.113 --> 25:07.549
'Bout six years now.

25:09.029 --> 25:10.944
And in the dining industry
overall?

25:11.161 --> 25:14.904
Guessing 19,
maybe 20 years.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.079
Right.

25:16.384 --> 25:17.820
-  Long time, huh?
It is a long time.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.213
You lived around here
your whole life?

25:19.387 --> 25:20.736
Why, as a matter of fact,
I have.

25:22.695 --> 25:25.611
You got any kids?
- Yes. Two boys.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.482
Eighteen and twenty-two.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.530
When's the last time
- you talked to them?
Well...

25:31.617 --> 25:32.748
You got a husband?

25:34.097 --> 25:37.318
Well, that's just--When was the last time
you've done something, Marsha?

25:37.666 --> 25:39.494
I--Like, really done something.

25:42.584 --> 25:43.629
Something that mattered.

25:53.508 --> 25:54.727
Nothing springs to mind?

25:58.339 --> 26:00.994
I'm going to go
place your order.

26:01.472 --> 26:02.430
Okay.

26:03.431 --> 26:04.475
Good chat, Marsh.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.308
Don't look at me like that.

26:11.613 --> 26:13.746
You think that
affected her life in any way?

26:22.102 --> 26:23.059
What about me?

26:26.062 --> 26:27.368
What about you what?

26:30.589 --> 26:32.373
What does
this have to do with me?

26:34.636 --> 26:36.551
You mean why are you here
right now?

26:39.293 --> 26:42.252
Because, Randy,
I have been watching you,

26:42.601 --> 26:45.778
and I know for a fact that
you are better than this shit.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.172
You have a full-sized,

26:49.259 --> 26:52.480
honest-to-God,
functioning human brain.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.789
And yet, today, I watched you
eat a day-old cheeseburger

26:56.876 --> 26:59.661
because a walking dick with arms
fucking told you to.

27:02.403 --> 27:03.883
You are twenty years old,

27:03.970 --> 27:05.711
and you are already
more pathetic

27:05.798 --> 27:08.104
than every person
in this godforsaken town,

27:08.191 --> 27:10.585
and that bugs
the living shit out of me.

27:16.591 --> 27:18.941
But there's something
about you. Hmm?

27:21.770 --> 27:23.076
There's something fixable.

27:25.556 --> 27:26.993
And I believe that.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.476
I mean, hell,
when you were standing there...

27:34.914 --> 27:36.045
watching me,

27:37.656 --> 27:39.092
waiting for me to kill you.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.187
That was the only thing
I believed.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.064
Does that answer your question?

28:00.635 --> 28:01.854
Thanks, Marsha.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.172
So, what now, then?

28:18.435 --> 28:20.655
I'm gonna eat my omelet
is "What now then?"

28:32.101 --> 28:34.190
What the fuck
are you doing? Let's go.

29:01.435 --> 29:02.958
I'm actually twenty-one.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.048
What?

29:06.353 --> 29:09.095
Before, you said I was twenty,
but I'm actually twenty-one.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.233
So, how long you been
out of high school?

29:18.931 --> 29:20.236
What is it, like three years?

29:20.323 --> 29:21.237
Two.

29:22.630 --> 29:23.892
I got held back a year.

29:25.459 --> 29:26.460
When?

29:30.029 --> 29:31.073
Second grade.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.253
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?

29:37.340 --> 29:38.820
What do you mean, "What?"

29:38.907 --> 29:41.431
How the fuck
do you fail second grade?

29:41.518 --> 29:44.434
Uh. I... I didn't fail.
I just got held back.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.001
For what?

29:46.697 --> 29:50.179
What'd you do?
You colored outside the lines?

29:52.138 --> 29:55.315
My mom just didn't think
that I was ready.

29:55.402 --> 29:58.927
Sounds like a crock
of bullshit to me, Randy.

30:00.886 --> 30:03.671
- Yeah, maybe.
- No, fucking definitely.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.934
That's some
over-parenting bullshit.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.764
You need to stand up
for yourself.

30:11.722 --> 30:14.813
Don't let them decide
- what's right for you.
- Well, I was only seven.

30:16.466 --> 30:17.598
Still.

30:35.964 --> 30:37.052
Bring that.

30:45.278 --> 30:46.366
This way.

30:50.196 --> 30:51.110
Let's go.

31:01.076 --> 31:02.121
Hey, Ma.

31:04.558 --> 31:05.602
I'll be right back.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.746
Hey. Give me that.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.401
I got you some breakfast.

31:22.228 --> 31:23.185
Thank you.

31:30.323 --> 31:33.543
Benny, did you get me
some cigarettes?

31:33.630 --> 31:35.937
No, Ma,
I forgot your cigarettes.

31:36.024 --> 31:38.940
Benny,
I asked you before you left.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.855
Yeah, well, you know...

31:42.117 --> 31:45.686
...you can
always get 'em yourself, Ma.

31:47.862 --> 31:52.084
Benny, you know
I can't get my cigarettes--

31:52.171 --> 31:54.042
Here's some fucking cigarettes.
Eat your breakfast.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.437
Don't touch anything.
I'll be right back.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.451
Who are you?

32:13.757 --> 32:16.282
Uh. I'm... I'm... I'm a friend.

32:17.109 --> 32:18.153
F... from work.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.337
What's all over your shirt?

32:33.212 --> 32:34.213
Um...

32:36.345 --> 32:37.390
It's ketchup.

32:38.478 --> 32:43.265
I-- I-- I spilled a big...
big thing of ketchup at work.

32:45.050 --> 32:47.095
Doesn't look like ketchup.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.315
Well, it's...
it's just dried now.

32:49.924 --> 32:51.012
It's from a while ago.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.762
Doesn't look like ketchup.

33:13.774 --> 33:14.862
Phone.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.125
Hmm?

33:20.650 --> 33:21.956
Hand me the phone.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.394
I need to make a call.

33:33.489 --> 33:34.490
Okay.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.019
Okay.

34:00.908 --> 34:02.866
Come on now.
Hand me the damn phone.

34:15.270 --> 34:16.445
Give me the phone.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.752
What the fuck
are you doing?

34:21.320 --> 34:23.278
What the fuck did I say to you?

34:23.365 --> 34:25.193
What the fuck did I say to you?

34:25.280 --> 34:27.108
I said
don't fucking touch anything.

34:27.195 --> 34:28.849
- You think I'm fucking with you?
- I'm just--

34:28.936 --> 34:30.111
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:30.198 --> 34:31.634
She... she...
she wanted the phone.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.984
She said she needed
to call somebody.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.948
Who the fuck
do you need to call?

34:42.428 --> 34:44.952
I want to call someone.

34:46.780 --> 34:51.045
Shit. Fucking no phone calls!

34:54.309 --> 34:55.267
Put 'em on.

35:00.924 --> 35:02.361
I just wanted to make

35:02.796 --> 35:05.538
a damn phone call, Benny.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.936
Come on. Walk.

35:38.962 --> 35:43.053
Randy, I think I may have been
sending you some mixed messages.

35:46.448 --> 35:48.668
I think that
when I talked to you

35:50.887 --> 35:52.585
about making your own decisions,

35:52.672 --> 35:55.588
you may have taken that
as a call to action.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.418
And maybe it was.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.204
And maybe that's my fault.

36:07.948 --> 36:09.732
But there's certain decisions...

36:09.993 --> 36:13.388
Certain decisions
that are bad decisions.

36:14.302 --> 36:15.912
Stupid decisions.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.437
And... and they put me
in a difficult position.

36:22.223 --> 36:23.659
They put me in a bind.

36:26.009 --> 36:29.709
Because it forces me
to hurt you...

36:32.973 --> 36:35.541
...when what I really want to do
is help you.

36:38.892 --> 36:40.372
You believe me, don't you?

36:44.854 --> 36:47.422
Because I really
fucking do.

36:50.382 --> 36:52.993
So let's just forget
about everything that happened.

36:54.168 --> 36:56.170
We'll forget
about everything in that house,

36:56.257 --> 37:00.653
and from now on,
the rest of today is about you.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.268
And if I'm gonna help you...

37:11.316 --> 37:12.621
like, really help you...

37:15.972 --> 37:18.105
...then I can't have you
getting in my way.

37:22.022 --> 37:25.068
I need you to work with me,
not against me.

37:25.678 --> 37:26.548
Okay?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.772
So, we square?

37:37.037 --> 37:37.994
Yeah.

37:39.779 --> 37:40.693
We're square.

37:42.912 --> 37:43.957
Super.

38:08.808 --> 38:10.418
Oh, fuck, man.

38:17.904 --> 38:19.253
Let me ask you something.

38:21.473 --> 38:22.691
That stuff Chris was saying

38:22.822 --> 38:24.780
about you not having
a girlfriend. Is that true?

38:26.652 --> 38:29.437
Uh. Yeah. Yeah, it's true.

38:31.004 --> 38:31.961
Are you gay?

38:33.572 --> 38:34.790
No, I'm not gay.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.098
You a virgin?

38:39.142 --> 38:40.143
Uh...

38:41.797 --> 38:44.757
Yeah.
That's good.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.890
- It is?
- Yeah, definitely.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.372
Look, you start having sex,
there's a chance

38:51.459 --> 38:53.374
that whoever you're fucking
is gonna get pregnant.

38:54.593 --> 38:57.247
Then some poor kid's gonna be
stuck with you as a father.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.685
Now, that's nothing personal.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.730
Too many guys
start fucking too early,

39:01.817 --> 39:03.645
they end up with kids
they don't want.

39:04.037 --> 39:05.560
Those kids grow up,
and they find out

39:05.647 --> 39:08.868
they only exist because
they had horny teenage parents.

39:13.263 --> 39:14.352
They start doing crack,

39:14.917 --> 39:16.789
they join a cult,

39:17.616 --> 39:20.880
or worse, they start having
their own unprotected sex.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.545
I'm beginning to think
that most of today's problems

39:33.632 --> 39:35.808
are a direct result
from the fact that teenagers

39:35.895 --> 39:38.027
can't stop themselves
from fucking each other.

39:39.986 --> 39:41.030
So, really,

39:42.858 --> 39:44.425
you're doing the world a favor.

39:48.037 --> 39:50.083
Yeah. I guess so.

39:53.216 --> 39:54.522
You ever had one?

39:56.568 --> 39:57.569
A girlfriend?

39:58.526 --> 40:02.878
Uh. Yeah, yeah, I... I had one.
It was a couple years ago.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.667
What was her name?

40:11.800 --> 40:12.932
Lisa.

40:13.019 --> 40:15.413
Lisa, like the Simpson.

40:18.111 --> 40:19.025
What happened?

40:21.027 --> 40:22.855
Her... her cat died.

40:25.727 --> 40:26.859
What do you mean?

40:28.774 --> 40:31.254
Her cat died, and then we

40:31.864 --> 40:33.953
just sort of stopped dating
after that.

40:34.127 --> 40:35.345
Because her cat died?

40:35.694 --> 40:36.738
Yeah.

40:37.609 --> 40:39.219
Or... kind of.

40:39.306 --> 40:41.569
What-- What are you--
What are you saying to me?

40:42.527 --> 40:44.920
What are you trying to say?
Like, you're saying she said,

40:45.007 --> 40:47.749
"I can't date you
- because my cat died"?
- No,

40:47.836 --> 40:49.751
I didn't--BENSON:
Then what the fuck did she say?

40:50.317 --> 40:53.451
We never really
- talked about it after.
But you were never like,

40:53.538 --> 40:55.453
"Hey, you remember that time
you broke up with me

40:55.540 --> 40:57.106
because of your fucking cat?"

40:58.804 --> 40:59.805
No, not really.

41:01.850 --> 41:04.200
This is,
like, unbelievable!

41:05.288 --> 41:07.073
Randy, no!

41:07.160 --> 41:09.205
Wait, where are we...
where are we going now?

41:09.292 --> 41:12.600
I need cigarettes.

41:16.822 --> 41:18.388
That is unbelievable.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.459
Let's go!

41:53.946 --> 41:57.210
You know, I saw you eyeballing
the gun when that pig drove by.

42:01.170 --> 42:03.172
I need you to remember
what we talked about.

42:04.826 --> 42:05.827
I remember.

42:06.262 --> 42:07.307
Do you?

42:08.787 --> 42:10.005
'Cause I'm not so sure.

42:17.491 --> 42:19.493
Top that off.
I'm gonna go pay inside.

43:18.421 --> 43:19.553
Get in the car.

43:20.206 --> 43:21.207
I got an idea.

43:21.990 --> 43:24.819
So, this Lisa...

43:26.125 --> 43:27.779
...you said
she works at the mall?

43:29.650 --> 43:30.608
Yeah.

43:32.479 --> 43:33.698
Think she's working today?

43:36.135 --> 43:37.789
I don't-- Uh. I don't know.

43:37.876 --> 43:40.400
Maybe, yeah. Sometimes,
she works on the weekends.

43:40.487 --> 43:41.706
Then that's where we're going.

43:44.012 --> 43:45.448
- Really?
- Yes.

43:45.535 --> 43:47.363
Yes! Fuck yes!

43:47.625 --> 43:50.671
Okay... We're gonna go meet Lisa.

43:50.758 --> 43:53.761
Look, this...
This makes so much sense.

43:54.414 --> 43:57.199
We got to... You got to go

43:58.548 --> 44:00.550
and talk to this Lisa...

44:00.638 --> 44:03.510
figure out what her deal is,
figure out why she dumped you...

44:03.597 --> 44:04.642
I-- I--...and then, you know,

44:04.729 --> 44:06.469
you can go, you can make up... I--

44:06.556 --> 44:08.036
...you can become best friends,

44:08.123 --> 44:09.908
you can punch her
- in the fucking face.
- Okay, but you--

44:09.995 --> 44:13.476
I don't care, but it is
imperative that you talk to her,

44:13.563 --> 44:16.001
because this is gonna help you
figure out your shit.

44:16.088 --> 44:18.873
Okay, um, but she--
Well, she might not--

44:18.960 --> 44:20.353
W... what if she's not there?

44:20.440 --> 44:23.878
Don't cross bridges
before you get to 'em, Randy.

Just a second.

Hey, how can I...

45:01.786 --> 45:02.830
Randy.

45:02.917 --> 45:04.266
Lisa, hi.

45:04.789 --> 45:06.312
Uh. How are you?

45:06.529 --> 45:08.009
I'm fine.

45:08.444 --> 45:09.619
How are you?

45:09.837 --> 45:11.273
Oh, I'm good.

45:12.318 --> 45:13.275

45:14.407 --> 45:16.626

listen to Motoörhead?

45:18.280 --> 45:21.283
Uh. I don't know. Just recently.

45:29.509 --> 45:30.423
Okay.

45:32.468 --> 45:34.470
So...  ...what's up?

45:35.863 --> 45:38.083
Well, uh, you know,
I was just stopping by,

45:38.170 --> 45:41.347
and I was actually
kinda wondering if we could

45:41.434 --> 45:43.653
- talk for a bit.
- Oh. Now's not really
a good time.

45:43.741 --> 45:46.395
Um, I know it looks dead
in here, but, uh,

45:46.482 --> 45:49.529
I've got a party of
second graders in an hour, so...

45:52.924 --> 45:54.708
Uh.
Well, it... it... it wouldn't...

45:54.795 --> 45:55.709
It wouldn't be that long.

45:55.883 --> 45:57.058
I'm sorry,
but I'm... I'm working.

45:57.232 --> 45:58.930
I'm here to help customers.

46:07.590 --> 46:09.462
Well, we can be customers.

46:12.247 --> 46:14.249
You want to decorate
stuffed animals?

46:14.815 --> 46:16.556
Yeah. Sure.

46:17.426 --> 46:19.472
If you talk to me while I do it.

46:24.738 --> 46:27.045
- Which one?
Uh. T-- What?

46:27.697 --> 46:31.353
Which stuffed animal
- do you want to decorate?
- Oh.  Um...

46:32.441 --> 46:37.098
Uh. Uh. I... How about the,
um... crocodile?

46:38.839 --> 46:39.797
You want one, too?

46:42.103 --> 46:43.713
Let me get a giraffe.

46:44.845 --> 46:46.020
Okay.

46:46.107 --> 46:49.197
Let me go get them
from the back. Excuse me.

47:11.698 --> 47:14.527
Randy, this is fucking weird.

47:16.050 --> 47:18.705
Yeah, I guess it kind of is.

47:19.924 --> 47:22.404
You want to tell me
what's going on?

47:25.146 --> 47:26.104
Yeah.

47:26.887 --> 47:27.888
Um...

47:30.412 --> 47:32.023
I was wondering...

47:33.981 --> 47:36.331
I was wondering
why you broke up with me

47:37.071 --> 47:38.377
after Oreo died.

47:40.205 --> 47:42.381
This is what you wanted
to talk to me about?

47:43.512 --> 47:46.428
Well, we never really
talked about it.

47:49.692 --> 47:52.043
No, I guess we didn't.

47:55.307 --> 47:56.177
So...

48:02.749 --> 48:07.319
It wasn't that I cared
so much about Oreo.

48:07.406 --> 48:09.538
I mean, I did, but...

48:10.452 --> 48:12.977
I... I wanted you
to care about him.

48:13.064 --> 48:15.675
Or I guess I wanted you
to care about the fact

48:15.762 --> 48:17.024
I cared about him.

48:17.546 --> 48:20.419
I wanted you to care
about something, Randy. I...

48:21.289 --> 48:24.031
I had no idea
whether you liked anything.

48:24.292 --> 48:26.164
You were always so closed off.

48:26.251 --> 48:28.818
We... we never talked
about what you wanted to do

48:28.906 --> 48:30.385
or how you felt
about your family

48:30.472 --> 48:31.560
or your friends.

48:35.042 --> 48:36.957
We never even talked about
what happened to you

48:37.044 --> 48:38.132
in second grade.

48:45.966 --> 48:48.142
Look, I...
I know it was unfair of me

48:48.229 --> 48:49.622
to just walk away
like that, but...

48:50.362 --> 48:52.712
...you didn't even try
to chase after me.

48:55.062 --> 48:57.630
Kind of just assumed
it didn't matter to you.

49:03.462 --> 49:04.550
Well,

49:06.639 --> 49:07.553
it did.

49:09.772 --> 49:10.991
Listen, Randy.

49:11.731 --> 49:13.907
I appreciate you coming here, really.

49:14.212 --> 49:15.430
I think it's good that...

49:15.517 --> 49:17.650
that you're trying
to change things up, but...

49:17.737 --> 49:21.306
this just doesn't seem
like the right way to do it.

49:21.959 --> 49:23.351
I don't get this.

49:24.309 --> 49:27.399
And I really don't get him.

49:28.530 --> 49:33.622
Yeah, I guess I'm just kind of
in a weird place right now.

49:33.709 --> 49:35.798
No kidding.

49:35.885 --> 49:39.672
You're spending your Saturday
gluing sequins on a crocodile.

49:39.759 --> 49:41.587
How's it going?

49:42.109 --> 49:44.982
Oh, look at you.
Fucking Picasso.

49:45.939 --> 49:47.462
That's pretty good, Randy.

49:51.162 --> 49:52.337
What are you doing later?

49:53.164 --> 49:54.165
Uh...

49:54.643 --> 49:57.385
I just started my shift, so...

49:59.431 --> 50:01.476
So, like,
if we came back later tonight,

50:01.563 --> 50:02.738
you might still be here?

50:03.174 --> 50:05.306
Uh, we should probably
get going.

50:06.525 --> 50:09.484
Right?
Before all those kids show up?

50:13.358 --> 50:17.275
Right, the kids.
Got the, uh, kids coming.

50:17.362 --> 50:18.493
Right.

50:20.408 --> 50:21.931
You keep up
the good work, huh?

50:27.589 --> 50:28.721
Come on, Randy.

50:30.027 --> 50:33.073
Uh, see you later, Randy.

50:33.900 --> 50:35.510
Let's go.

50:35.597 --> 50:36.511
Um...

50:38.861 --> 50:39.949
Yeah, I'll...

50:41.560 --> 50:42.430
see you.

50:46.826 --> 50:48.871
I'm sure she's
a lovely girl, Randy,

50:48.958 --> 50:52.179
but honestly, I don't think
she's worth the fuss.

50:53.354 --> 50:54.268
Why not?

50:54.660 --> 50:56.357
Well, for starters,
she works in a shopping mall.

50:56.488 --> 50:57.793
Well, what's wrong
with shopping malls?

50:57.880 --> 50:59.534
Oh, I don't know.
They're just the embodiment

50:59.621 --> 51:00.927
of corporate greed
and everything else

51:01.014 --> 51:02.407
that's fucked-up in the world.

51:02.494 --> 51:03.625
Well, we work in fast food.

51:03.712 --> 51:05.236
Isn't that, like,
the same thing?

51:05.323 --> 51:07.760
No, it's not.

51:08.891 --> 51:10.632
People go to fast food places

51:10.719 --> 51:11.938
'cause they need something
to eat.

51:12.025 --> 51:14.810
A mall serves
absolutely no purpose.

51:15.594 --> 51:17.639
They just lump together
every form of consumption

51:17.726 --> 51:20.860
into one giant, glittering,
air-conditioned asshole.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.213
Besides, I don't work
in fast food anymore.

51:30.478 --> 51:32.393
- What the fuck is that?
- That's my cell phone.

51:35.657 --> 51:38.399
Says "Mom."Yeah, uh, I should answer that.

51:38.747 --> 51:40.097
I don't think
that's a good idea.

51:40.184 --> 51:42.186
No, I promise it'll be
much worse if I don't.

51:47.278 --> 51:49.845
- Okay.
- Now make it quick.

51:53.762 --> 51:55.634
- What?
- Just, it's for precaution.

51:55.721 --> 51:56.591
Mm.

51:56.852 --> 51:57.984
Hi, Mom.

51:58.941 --> 52:00.639
<i>That was four rings
before picking up, Randy.</i>

52:00.639 --> 52:01.727
<i>Is something wrong?</i> Uh, no, Mom.

52:02.771 --> 52:04.512
<i>Are you avoiding me?</i> Of course not, Mom.

52:04.599 --> 52:06.035
Uh. It just took me a second.

52:06.819 --> 52:08.908
<i>Where are you? It sounds like
you're outside somewhere.</i>

52:08.995 --> 52:11.737
No, I'm... Well, yes,
I'm-- I'm outside of the mall.

52:11.824 --> 52:14.479
- I'm... I'm with a friend.
<i>Why are you at the mall?</i>

52:14.566 --> 52:15.958
He-- He just-- He-- He--

52:16.045 --> 52:18.178
He wanted me
to help him pick out some stuff.

52:19.092 --> 52:20.920
<i>Well, you've been
out of work for a while.</i>

52:21.007 --> 52:22.400
<i>When were you planning
on telling me this?</i>

52:24.576 --> 52:26.708
<i>Do I know
this friend? What's his name?</i>

52:26.795 --> 52:28.797
Hi... his... his name is Benson. You...

52:30.103 --> 52:31.626
You don't know him
but he's a nice guy.

52:31.713 --> 52:33.062
<i>Try not to be too long.</i>

52:34.890 --> 52:36.457
Okay, well, listen, Mom,
I... I should probably--

52:36.544 --> 52:38.024
-  End the call.
<i>Don't forget,</i>

52:38.111 --> 52:39.330
<i>we need you to come home
for dinner.</i>

52:39.417 --> 52:40.766
<i>We're hosting
Haley's dance team tonight.</i>

52:40.853 --> 52:41.854
Uh. Right, right.

52:42.202 --> 52:43.290
Okay, yeah, I-- Hang up the phone.

52:43.595 --> 52:45.292
I have to go. RANDY'S MOM:
<i>And I need you to wear</i>

52:45.379 --> 52:46.989
<i>that white button-down shirt
that I left out for you.</i>

52:47.076 --> 52:48.643
Okay. Bye, Mom.

52:53.605 --> 52:55.433
- Is she always like that?
- Yeah, pretty much.

52:56.085 --> 52:58.305
I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with you, Randy,

52:58.392 --> 53:00.002
but you're never gonna
figure it out if your mom's

53:00.089 --> 53:01.830
dragging you around
by your dick all day.

53:02.962 --> 53:04.093
She's a little too involved...

53:04.224 --> 53:05.443
...in how you make decisions.

53:05.530 --> 53:08.837
Yeah. Guess so.

53:10.056 --> 53:12.058
I mean, she held you back
in second grade

53:12.145 --> 53:14.887
for Christ's sake.
Who the fuck does that?

53:15.148 --> 53:16.149
Yeah.

53:16.236 --> 53:18.064
It's just
micromanaging bullshit.

53:19.196 --> 53:20.893
Listen, you're a fucking adult, Randy.

53:21.720 --> 53:23.374
You need to have
a little self-respect.

53:23.461 --> 53:25.114
Well, there's something
I should tell you.

53:27.029 --> 53:28.074
What?

53:28.335 --> 53:29.902
About when I got held back.

53:29.989 --> 53:31.338
It wasn't just 'cause of my mom.

53:34.602 --> 53:35.516
What do you mean?

53:36.909 --> 53:40.913
Um, there was,
um... there was an incident.

53:43.394 --> 53:45.352
- An incident?
- Yeah.

53:47.049 --> 53:47.963
Um...

53:48.094 --> 53:50.270
- What, like a fire?
- No, not exactly.

53:50.357 --> 53:51.793
What the fuck are you
talking about, then?

53:51.880 --> 53:53.099
I had this teacher.

53:54.579 --> 53:55.536
Miss Beard.

53:57.364 --> 53:59.061
And she was, like, this...

54:01.803 --> 54:03.196
Everyone loved her.

54:03.544 --> 54:08.027
I mean, I loved her.

54:08.114 --> 54:10.029
Only, there was this game
we would play.

54:10.116 --> 54:12.945
Um... it was a...

54:13.032 --> 54:15.382
You know when you're, like,
kicking field goals

54:16.731 --> 54:18.603
- but you're using your fingers?
- Yeah.

54:18.690 --> 54:20.561
And... and the football's
an eraser?

54:20.648 --> 54:23.999
Well, we used to do it with a...
with a folded-up piece of paper,

54:24.086 --> 54:25.174
- but yeah.
- Right.

54:25.262 --> 54:26.524
Well, we did it with erasers.

54:26.785 --> 54:27.786
Okay.

54:28.221 --> 54:31.529
And like I said,
w... we'd all play it,

54:31.616 --> 54:32.530
and, um...

54:33.879 --> 54:36.055
it got really disruptive,
I guess, and one day,

54:36.142 --> 54:39.450
Miss Beard had just
had it with us and...

54:41.016 --> 54:43.149
I was the one
she caught doing it, and so...

54:44.542 --> 54:45.934
she yelled.

54:47.588 --> 54:51.853
And something about it
just made me so angry because...

54:52.114 --> 54:54.769
I was being singled out

54:54.856 --> 54:57.163
even though we'd all done it.

54:57.424 --> 54:59.948
It just seemed so unfair,
and I... I... I'd never--

55:00.035 --> 55:01.123
Sure.

55:01.210 --> 55:04.213
I'd never felt
that angry before.

55:04.779 --> 55:05.693
Yeah.

55:06.303 --> 55:07.956
And so I... I took the eraser,

55:08.043 --> 55:11.395
and I put it to the end
of this stupid plastic ruler,

55:11.482 --> 55:13.048
and I pulled it back
like it was a catapult,

55:13.135 --> 55:15.790
and I shot it, and it went
flying through the air.

55:15.877 --> 55:18.489
It was, like, I'd never seen
something fly so fast.

55:18.619 --> 55:20.229
Um.

55:23.015 --> 55:24.146
And it hit her in the eye.

55:26.801 --> 55:27.846
Like, right in the eye.

55:32.546 --> 55:34.287
You knocked out
your teacher's eye?

55:34.896 --> 55:36.028
No, I didn't...

55:36.811 --> 55:37.812
It didn't knock it out.

55:38.770 --> 55:39.814
It just...

55:40.772 --> 55:41.947
There was, um...

55:42.034 --> 55:43.688
Apparently, there were
some bits of lead...

55:44.515 --> 55:47.474
still on the eraser and...
and they got stuck in her eye,

55:47.561 --> 55:49.389
and they had to remove it.

55:49.476 --> 55:51.260
So you knocked out
your teacher's eye?

55:51.348 --> 55:54.002
I wasn't trying to. Oh, my God.

55:55.264 --> 55:56.962
My God!

56:04.535 --> 56:05.840
Well, it gets worse.

56:09.278 --> 56:12.847
How...  How the fuck
does it get worse

56:12.934 --> 56:14.849
than you knocking out
your teacher's eye?

56:14.936 --> 56:16.329
Well, when she came back,
she had...

56:16.416 --> 56:17.939
she had to wear
an eye patch and--

56:25.599 --> 56:27.471
And all the kids started
calling her Blackbeard.

56:32.258 --> 56:33.738
They wouldn't just--BENSON:
That's fucking incredible.

56:33.825 --> 56:34.695
They wouldn't stop.

56:34.913 --> 56:35.783
They wouldn't stop.

56:36.044 --> 56:38.046
And... and then
all the other teachers

56:38.133 --> 56:39.657
started calling her Blackbeard
behind her back.

56:39.744 --> 56:41.398
Like, her life
totally fell apart.

56:43.312 --> 56:45.880
And... and... and then we heard

56:45.967 --> 56:47.578
she wouldn't even, like,
leave the house.

56:49.231 --> 56:51.451
And then after that,
she took a leave of absence.

56:52.757 --> 56:54.149
And so my mom...

56:55.455 --> 56:57.718
she decided it might be best
for me if...

56:59.024 --> 57:00.547
...if I took second grade
all over again.

57:01.722 --> 57:06.335
That's pretty fucked-up.

57:08.207 --> 57:10.949
- Yeah. It is.
- Yeah.

57:18.522 --> 57:19.827
What's she do now?

57:21.394 --> 57:22.917
I think she's back to teaching.

57:26.181 --> 57:27.792
You really fucked up
her life, huh?

57:33.145 --> 57:34.886
Yeah, I guess I did.

57:38.846 --> 57:42.328
God, hey. Hey. Hey.

57:42.415 --> 57:44.591
Come on.

57:45.897 --> 57:46.985
It was an accident.

57:51.816 --> 57:52.904
Forget about it.

57:54.166 --> 57:56.211
It's not the kind of thing
you just forget.

57:59.476 --> 58:01.434
And besides,
it wasn't an accident.

58:04.437 --> 58:06.047
You're seven years old, Randy.

58:09.747 --> 58:11.749
You're not trying
to take your teacher's eye out.

58:11.836 --> 58:13.707
No, listen,
Miss Beard was...

58:13.794 --> 58:15.666
she was... she was special.

58:15.753 --> 58:18.103
-  Randy.
And because of me,

58:18.190 --> 58:19.365
her life was ruined.

58:20.758 --> 58:22.629
You know why I let Chris
walk all over me?

58:23.500 --> 58:25.371
Why I ate
that cheeseburger today?

58:25.458 --> 58:28.069
Because nothing good comes
from me making my own decisions.

58:29.810 --> 58:33.248
The one time I let myself react
the way I wanted to,

58:33.422 --> 58:34.685
I ruined a person's life.

58:36.904 --> 58:39.733
So... yeah, maybe you're right.

58:41.474 --> 58:42.823
Maybe I'm a waste of space.

58:45.478 --> 58:48.046
But at least I don't get
in the way of other... people

58:48.612 --> 58:49.700
trying to be happy.

58:52.964 --> 58:54.008
So, there you go.

59:03.148 --> 59:05.629
You said she still works
at your old elementary school?

59:14.159 --> 59:15.856
Benson,
we don't need to do this.

59:16.117 --> 59:17.031
It's not like...

59:23.690 --> 59:25.866
Benson. Benson.

59:26.345 --> 59:28.173
I'm telling you,
we... we can't do this.

59:28.695 --> 59:30.262
I don't see why not.

59:30.349 --> 59:31.785
Well, it's Saturday.
No one's even here.

59:31.872 --> 59:33.178
Relax.

59:34.396 --> 59:35.702
We're just gonna check it out.

59:40.011 --> 59:43.231
Okay, wait.
Benson, please, please--

59:43.318 --> 59:44.929
- No!
- Cool your jets, Randy.

59:45.016 --> 59:47.148
You-- You can't just m... mess
with other people's lives.

59:47.235 --> 59:49.194
I'm not messing with anybody.

59:51.457 --> 59:53.111
I'm doing this
for your own good.

59:54.634 --> 59:55.896
You say nothing good comes
from you ever reacting?

59:55.983 --> 59:57.376
Well, how about
never reacting at all?

59:58.899 --> 01:00:01.032
- Do you think that's safer?
Mm-hmm.

01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:02.294
Because it's not.

01:00:03.991 --> 01:00:05.166
Let me show you.

01:00:11.346 --> 01:00:13.784
Do you see what happens
when you do nothing?

01:00:15.742 --> 01:00:18.615
Now, I've spent all day
listening to you

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:20.573
come up with excuse after excuse

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.836
for being the sad little person
that you are.

01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:26.274
And now we're gonna
do something about it.

01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:29.756
We're gonna find this fucking
cyclops teacher of yours,

01:00:29.843 --> 01:00:31.236
and we're gonna see
if she's really worth

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:34.500
you throwing
your entire life away over.

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:40.158
We're already here.

01:00:40.854 --> 01:00:42.377
We've come all this way,

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:46.164
and there is no way
that I am leaving...

01:00:48.775 --> 01:00:51.778
...until I see a woman
with an eye patch.

01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:54.085
Let's go.

01:01:06.837 --> 01:01:08.969
- May I help you?
Yes.

01:01:09.056 --> 01:01:10.797
Uh, we were wondering...

01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:14.192
does Miss Patricia Beard
still work here?

01:01:14.279 --> 01:01:15.672
Yes, she does.

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:16.716
Wonderful.

01:01:17.935 --> 01:01:20.546
She wouldn't happen
to be here today, would she?

01:01:20.633 --> 01:01:23.462
Well, n... no, gentlemen.
It's Saturday.

01:01:24.158 --> 01:01:26.291
We really only have
the janitorial staff

01:01:26.378 --> 01:01:28.902
and a few administrators
that pop in.

01:01:29.555 --> 01:01:31.339
Yeah, of course. Of course.
That makes sense.

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:34.734
Um.

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:36.518
Well, then you wouldn't be able

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.607
to give us her address,
would you?

01:01:39.521 --> 01:01:43.700
I'm sorry, but who exactly
am I speaking with?

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:46.224
Oh.

01:01:46.572 --> 01:01:49.270
We're, um--
We're former students.

01:01:50.315 --> 01:01:51.969
We're just looking
to get in touch with her.

01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:54.188
Well, it's really not
within my discretion

01:01:54.275 --> 01:01:55.668
to provide you

01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:57.626
with our faculty's
personal information.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.455
And I totally get that.
I do. I totally get it.

01:02:01.282 --> 01:02:03.894
Um, listen, this is--I'm sorry, but I can't.

01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:05.330
No, I... I understand.

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:08.768
This is a very
special situation.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.075
You see, this...

01:02:13.991 --> 01:02:15.253
...is Randy Bradley.

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:17.081
Hi.

01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:22.521
Come on, miss.

01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:23.914
You've worked here
long enough, right?

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:25.611
The Randy Bradley,
with the...

01:02:28.005 --> 01:02:29.484
Oh.

01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:31.617
- Yeah.
- Well, I...

01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:34.446
I don't know.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.970
Look, we're moving
to the city tomorrow,

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.147
and Randy here,
he was just...

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:43.716
Well, he was hoping
to have a chance

01:02:43.803 --> 01:02:45.457
to pay his respects
before we took off.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.375
Please, miss,
it's a small favor.

01:02:51.593 --> 01:02:53.160
But it would mean a lot.

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:55.815
Well...

01:02:58.122 --> 01:03:00.167
All right.

01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:02.300
I suppose
I can make an exception.

01:03:02.735 --> 01:03:04.128
Thank you.

01:03:04.215 --> 01:03:09.220
Let's see. Let's see.

01:03:24.017 --> 01:03:27.455
Carol, I left the schedule
on my desk.

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:29.370
Of course, Mr. Sheppard.
Have a good evening.

01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:30.676
I'll see you on Monday.

01:03:32.634 --> 01:03:35.202
- Mr. Sheppard.
- Yes?

01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:41.818
- Elliot Sheppard?
Yes, that's right.

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:46.170
You used to teach third grade
at Central Elementary.

01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:50.870
Yes. Yes, I did.
That's been quite a while ago.

01:03:54.743 --> 01:03:58.138
I'm sorry, uh, d... do I...?No. No, no, no, no.

01:03:59.357 --> 01:04:02.273
No, I just knew somebody
who... who used to go there.

01:04:03.665 --> 01:04:05.624
Well...
...nice to meet you.

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:08.148
I'll see you, Carol.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:10.629
Have a good night, Mr. Sheppard.

01:04:12.283 --> 01:04:15.982
1737 Hazel Drive, Centerwood.

01:04:16.591 --> 01:04:18.115
It's just past the diner.

01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:21.335
- Just follow Snowbank.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:04:21.683 --> 01:04:23.337
A... and, Mr. Bradley,

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:26.340
I really think
you're doing the right thing.

01:04:27.689 --> 01:04:29.561
Good for you.

01:04:47.796 --> 01:04:48.667
Stay.

01:04:53.628 --> 01:04:54.673
Hey, Sheppard.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.549
Wait. No.

01:05:06.554 --> 01:05:08.687
Stand up!

01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:23.136
Wait, Benson.

01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:26.096
Benson, Benson, no.

01:05:30.752 --> 01:05:32.711
Benson, you can't. You...

01:05:32.798 --> 01:05:34.278
Look, look, look.
We have Miss Beard's address.

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:35.583
We have to go find her.

01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:37.281
You... you said--

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:39.761
You said you were doing...
doing this for me.

01:05:40.806 --> 01:05:43.026
You... you told me to...
you told me to do something.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.549
We're doing something.

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:56.343
Let's go!

01:05:59.172 --> 01:06:01.044
Randy!

01:06:22.369 --> 01:06:25.068
That... that guy--BENSON: You bring him up again,

01:06:25.242 --> 01:06:26.330
and I'll kill you.

01:06:35.469 --> 01:06:37.906
Things got fucked-up
back there.

01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:39.821
You were right to intervene.

01:06:42.694 --> 01:06:43.956
You're learning, huh?

01:06:48.221 --> 01:06:50.528
Look, I told you
I was doing this for you,

01:06:50.615 --> 01:06:51.659
and I meant it.

01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:59.754
So let's just forget about it, huh?

01:07:02.192 --> 01:07:03.454
Forget about him.

01:07:08.937 --> 01:07:10.026
Everything's cool.

01:07:19.296 --> 01:07:20.819
Everything's cool, right?

01:07:22.473 --> 01:07:23.430
Randy?

01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:27.695
Yeah. Definitely.

01:07:31.177 --> 01:07:32.178
Good.

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:47.193
This is it?

01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:49.630
This is it.

01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:52.590
Do we really need...

01:08:22.446 --> 01:08:23.490
Quiet, Crisco.

01:08:29.627 --> 01:08:30.628
May I help you?

01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:35.807
- It's a little late for visitors.
- Hi. W-- Uh, we...

01:08:36.068 --> 01:08:38.766
Uh, we... Uh. Hi.

01:08:40.725 --> 01:08:41.813
Randy?

01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:44.642
Randy Bradley, is that you?

01:08:45.817 --> 01:08:46.992
Yeah.  Hi.

01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:52.389
Uh. H... How are you?

01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:54.173
I'm doing well,
Randy. How are you?

01:08:56.219 --> 01:09:00.310
- This is so unexpected.
- Uh, yeah, I guess it is.

01:09:00.397 --> 01:09:01.572
Sorry.

01:09:01.659 --> 01:09:03.791
No, there's no reason
to apologize.

01:09:05.445 --> 01:09:06.359
Hello.

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.405
This is Benson.

01:09:09.275 --> 01:09:10.146
Hi.

01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:12.931
So, what brings you
out this way?

01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:15.847
Um...

01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:20.243
I, um...

01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:24.160
I wanted to, uh...

01:09:28.555 --> 01:09:29.948
I needed-- I'm sorry.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.475
Do you want to maybe come inside
for a minute?

01:09:40.611 --> 01:09:41.916
- Okay.
Okay.

01:09:42.526 --> 01:09:43.483
Yeah.

01:09:45.442 --> 01:09:47.618
Be careful, the walls
are still a little wet.

01:09:55.321 --> 01:09:56.888
You can have a seat
if you want.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:09:59.195
I'm good.

01:10:04.722 --> 01:10:06.767
Can I use your restroom?

01:10:06.854 --> 01:10:08.334
Sure.
It's right through there,

01:10:08.421 --> 01:10:11.032
- just first door on the left.
- All right.

01:10:16.429 --> 01:10:17.996
Here you go.

01:10:25.786 --> 01:10:26.918
He's interesting.

01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:28.789
Yeah.

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:34.839
Is he always so quiet?

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:36.884
Not really.

01:10:42.977 --> 01:10:44.240
Are you feeling any better?

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:48.287
Yeah. Thank you.

01:10:50.942 --> 01:10:53.161
I just wasn't expecting...

01:10:55.076 --> 01:10:56.600
I don't know
what I was expecting.

01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:58.297
Well...

01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:01.909
I must say it's a bit of a shock
for me, too.

01:11:02.736 --> 01:11:05.957
I don't normally get visits
from former students.

01:11:06.914 --> 01:11:08.873
We were at the school
before we came here.

01:11:09.656 --> 01:11:11.354
They had your address.
I hope that's okay.

01:11:11.963 --> 01:11:13.007
Of course.

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:20.711
Miss Beard...

01:11:23.714 --> 01:11:25.019
I know it's, um...

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:29.328
too late for me to do
anything about it, but, um,

01:11:29.415 --> 01:11:31.112
I just... I... I wanted to...

01:11:34.899 --> 01:11:36.944
I needed to tell you...

01:11:39.033 --> 01:11:40.339
how sorry I am for, um...

01:11:41.688 --> 01:11:42.689
about the...

01:11:44.517 --> 01:11:45.692
about what happened.

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:49.261
I know it doesn't make it
any better, but I've...

01:11:51.481 --> 01:11:53.439
felt absolutely terrible
about it for a really...

01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:57.530
really long time and, um,
if it was...

01:11:57.704 --> 01:12:00.707
Sorry. If there was, uh,
some... some way I could, um...

01:12:05.277 --> 01:12:06.800
Uh, if I...

01:12:09.281 --> 01:12:10.282
Is that...

01:12:12.632 --> 01:12:16.375
My daughter.

01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:17.681
You have a daughter?

01:12:18.072 --> 01:12:20.510
Yes. Tessa.

01:12:23.861 --> 01:12:24.731
So...

01:12:26.516 --> 01:12:27.386
you're married?

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:30.041
Divorced.

01:12:30.694 --> 01:12:33.610
She's at her dad's
for the weekend.

01:12:38.223 --> 01:12:41.966
After the sabbatical...

01:12:43.924 --> 01:12:44.969
I traveled for a bit.

01:12:47.014 --> 01:12:48.451
Got involved with this guy.

01:12:50.801 --> 01:12:53.456
Wound up in a marriage that
probably never should've been.

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:56.937
When you get older,

01:12:57.024 --> 01:12:59.505
you'll see that
such things tend to happen

01:12:59.766 --> 01:13:02.203
pretty easily if you let them.

01:13:04.467 --> 01:13:05.903
But I... I can't complain.

01:13:07.731 --> 01:13:09.341
If things hadn't happened
the way they did,

01:13:09.428 --> 01:13:10.690
I wouldn't have her.

01:13:10.777 --> 01:13:14.128
Wow, that's, uh...

01:13:19.569 --> 01:13:21.309
I...

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:24.356
I think I expected you
to be less...

01:13:25.836 --> 01:13:27.664
Happy?

01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:32.625
Well...

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:36.194
...If you showed up here
ten years ago,

01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:39.502
you might have found
more of what you were expecting.

01:13:41.765 --> 01:13:46.204
After I lost the eye, I spent
a lot of time being miserable.

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:49.816
It took me a while
to realize that I was actually

01:13:50.817 --> 01:13:52.906
pretty lucky that things
happened the way they did.

01:13:54.386 --> 01:13:55.300
"Lucky"?

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:59.478
Yeah. Of course,
my life wasn't perfect.

01:14:01.088 --> 01:14:02.133
Mm.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.570
If all it took was
for one bad thing to happen

01:14:04.657 --> 01:14:08.705
for me to lose my job,
my coworkers, my fiancé,

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.576
then none
of those things were worth

01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:12.143
really having
in the first place.

01:14:13.536 --> 01:14:16.016
And they all would've
disappointed me eventually.

01:14:17.148 --> 01:14:20.020
Yeah, but weren't you
h... happier before?

01:14:21.369 --> 01:14:23.459
Maybe I thought so at the time.

01:14:24.851 --> 01:14:27.332
But I wouldn't want to go back.

01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:30.466
The truth is...

01:14:31.728 --> 01:14:33.120
everyone gets hurt, Randy.

01:14:34.252 --> 01:14:35.819
Not everyone is ready for it.

01:15:00.365 --> 01:15:02.846
You know, I...
I always wondered...

01:15:03.455 --> 01:15:05.718
...if I would get a chance
to see you again.

01:15:08.373 --> 01:15:11.985
You were such
a sweet little kid.

01:15:14.597 --> 01:15:17.121
I was worried that whole...

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:20.254
...experience might have
shook you up a bit.

01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:30.917
I guess I kind of always
assumed you...

01:15:31.004 --> 01:15:33.180
- ...hated me.
- For what happened?

01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:36.532
Of course not.

01:15:39.622 --> 01:15:41.798
It takes a lot of energy
to hate a seven-year-old.

01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:08.912
Anyway, it was really
brave of you to come see me.

01:16:10.043 --> 01:16:11.349
Most people wouldn't have.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:39.986
Let's go.

01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:42.728
Get up. Let's go.

01:16:43.424 --> 01:16:45.513
I'm sorry.
I was just cleaning up,
but if you'd like

01:16:45.644 --> 01:16:46.819
some tea, there's--BENSON: No, no.

01:16:46.993 --> 01:16:48.952
I'm good. I'm good.
We're actually gonna get going.

01:16:49.082 --> 01:16:51.171
Oh. But you have
to at least tell me

01:16:51.258 --> 01:16:52.520
how you know Randy here.

01:16:53.347 --> 01:16:55.045
Uh, we work together.

01:16:55.393 --> 01:16:56.786
Well, we used to work together.

01:16:59.919 --> 01:17:02.356
Randy's real sorry
about your eye.

01:17:02.443 --> 01:17:03.575
He told you that, right?

01:17:04.576 --> 01:17:05.490
Yes, he did.

01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:09.320
Good. Can we go?

01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:11.235
Sorry, uh,
let me just answer that,

01:17:11.322 --> 01:17:12.540
and then I'll see you two out.

01:17:17.328 --> 01:17:18.372
Hello?

01:17:18.982 --> 01:17:19.852
Hi, Carol.

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:22.202
What?

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:24.552
Wait. Slow down.

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:29.383
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

01:17:32.212 --> 01:17:34.650
Uh, is he...

01:17:39.132 --> 01:17:41.047
Oh, God.

01:17:44.398 --> 01:17:48.489
Yeah, of course. I will.
Has anyone called Susan?

01:18:07.465 --> 01:18:08.553
Everything okay?

01:18:10.207 --> 01:18:13.340
Uh.
Someone just assaulted our...

01:18:14.124 --> 01:18:15.560
vice principal
in the parking lot.

01:18:15.821 --> 01:18:16.822
Hmm.

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:21.174
Is he alive?

01:18:23.176 --> 01:18:26.049
Apparently, he was when
the ambulance got there, but...

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:29.705
No, he didn't make it
to the hospital.

01:18:37.756 --> 01:18:40.759
Outside of a elementary school.

01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:44.154
Randy, you were just there.

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:46.852
Did you hear anything
about that?

01:18:50.247 --> 01:18:52.423
Um--BENSON: No.

01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:59.517
No, we didn't hear anything
about it.

01:19:18.623 --> 01:19:19.755
Shit.

01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:22.192
No, no, Benson. No, no.
- Oh, my God.

01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:23.497
- What are you doing?
- Put it away.

01:19:23.628 --> 01:19:24.977
- Shut up.
I don't understand.

01:19:25.151 --> 01:19:26.022
You can't kill her.

01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:27.545
Well, we can't fucking
leave her here, can we?

01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:28.938
Look, Benson, please--Hey!

01:19:30.678 --> 01:19:32.245
I am not getting caught

01:19:32.332 --> 01:19:34.770
on account of that fucking
shit stain of an old man!

01:19:34.857 --> 01:19:36.293
Do you fucking understand me?

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.643
This isn't what you want.
- You don't know me!

01:19:39.818 --> 01:19:41.689
You don't know
what the fuck I want!

01:19:41.951 --> 01:19:44.475
You're the reason we fucking
came here in the first place!

01:19:44.562 --> 01:19:45.911
This is your fucking fault!

01:19:45.998 --> 01:19:47.870
Okay, okay, fine, yes,
it's my fault, but...

01:19:48.261 --> 01:19:49.959
We're here because you wanted
to help me, Benson. Uh.

01:19:50.046 --> 01:19:51.525
How is-- How is killing her
gonna help me?

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:53.005
My daughter,

01:19:53.092 --> 01:19:54.702
- her name is Tessa.
- Don't say her name.
Shut up.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:55.921
- She's eight.
Don't say her name.

01:19:56.008 --> 01:19:57.270
- Shut up!
- She's about to have a birthday.

01:19:58.010 --> 01:19:59.577
Shut the fuck up!
- I was gonna take her to...

01:20:01.753 --> 01:20:04.234
Will you shut
this fucking dog up!

01:20:04.321 --> 01:20:07.411
Quiet, Crisco. Quiet, baby.

01:20:07.498 --> 01:20:09.108
Benson, you... you can't.

01:20:09.195 --> 01:20:11.502
Stop telling me what I can
and can't do, Randy.

01:20:22.121 --> 01:20:25.908
Okay, let's go.

01:20:25.995 --> 01:20:27.257
Empty your pockets.

01:20:27.344 --> 01:20:28.562
Wait, wait,
she's coming with us?

01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:29.650
Empty your fucking--

01:20:30.477 --> 01:20:31.827
She's coming with us.
Empty your pockets.

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:33.263
Can't we just...

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:34.394
Shut up!

01:20:56.068 --> 01:20:57.243
Where are you taking us?

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.207
You're the one
who attacked Elliot?

01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:08.298
Why would you do that?

01:21:08.385 --> 01:21:09.690
Will you shut the fuck up?

01:21:09.777 --> 01:21:10.866
But why are you--

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:12.389
Will you shut the fuck up?

01:21:15.131 --> 01:21:17.350
Just shut up!

01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:24.053
I was gonna fucking shoot you.

01:21:25.619 --> 01:21:27.447
You're lucky Randy here
talked me out of it.

01:21:27.534 --> 01:21:29.580
Just shut the fuck up.

01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:36.804
You see, Randy here,

01:21:37.936 --> 01:21:39.633
he was my little experiment
for the day.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:40.634
Right, Randy?

01:21:42.985 --> 01:21:45.204
And he had a few things
that he needed to work out,

01:21:45.291 --> 01:21:47.467
and I was gonna help him
with those things.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:54.170
Turns out that
you're one of them.

01:21:57.086 --> 01:21:58.914
Now, if you want to know
why this is happening...

01:22:01.177 --> 01:22:02.265
you can thank him.

01:22:16.714 --> 01:22:18.237
Benson.

01:22:20.674 --> 01:22:22.285
What, Randy?

01:22:23.112 --> 01:22:24.852
I... I need to use the bathroom.

01:22:26.506 --> 01:22:28.682
I can't help you, bro.

01:22:30.989 --> 01:22:33.557
I... I haven't gone all day.
I kind of really need to go.

01:22:33.644 --> 01:22:35.167
Well, then look
in the back seat!

01:22:36.038 --> 01:22:38.649
Find a soda bottle or some shit.
I don't know.

01:22:42.566 --> 01:22:44.568
It's not a bottle situation, Benson.

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:48.398
Of course it's not.
Are you fucking serious?

01:23:10.768 --> 01:23:11.812
Benson.

01:23:12.378 --> 01:23:13.379
Can I go?

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.472
I want my coffee first.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.868
You could just
let us go, you know.

01:23:25.217 --> 01:23:26.784
You could leave right now,

01:23:26.871 --> 01:23:28.699
and no one would have to know
that this happened.

01:23:29.439 --> 01:23:30.483
Stop talking.

01:23:32.181 --> 01:23:34.226
You don't want
to make things worse

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.619
for yourself by taking hostages.

01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:36.794
You have no idea

01:23:36.881 --> 01:23:38.578
what's really happening
right now.

01:23:41.973 --> 01:23:45.324
I'm gonna get my food,
I'm gonna get my coffee,

01:23:45.585 --> 01:23:48.240
and then I'm going to decide
where we're going,

01:23:48.327 --> 01:23:49.720
and then we are
going to go there,

01:23:49.807 --> 01:23:51.809
because I'm deciding.

01:23:53.419 --> 01:23:54.290
Not you.

01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:57.554
No more talking.

01:23:59.382 --> 01:24:00.513
Ready to order?

01:24:01.775 --> 01:24:03.125
Yeah.
I'll take a coffee.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:05.040
And y'all?

01:24:06.824 --> 01:24:08.086
Well, what about food?

01:24:12.438 --> 01:24:14.875
Just give us
another minute, will you?

01:24:14.962 --> 01:24:16.051
Sure thing.

01:24:26.278 --> 01:24:27.323
Can I go now?

01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:31.240
Please. You can see
the bathroom right there.

01:24:39.987 --> 01:24:41.163
Two minutes. Go.

01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:04.838
<i>9-1-1. What is your emergency?</i>

01:25:04.925 --> 01:25:05.883
I...

01:25:07.276 --> 01:25:08.755
Uh.
There's... there's a situation

01:25:08.842 --> 01:25:09.930
at the Kutzburg Diner.

01:25:10.844 --> 01:25:12.759
<i>What kind
of situation, sir? What's wrong?</i>

01:25:13.195 --> 01:25:15.414
There's a...
there's a... a man with a gun.

01:25:15.849 --> 01:25:18.461
<i>Is anyone hurt?</i> Uh. No, no. Not yet.

01:25:18.722 --> 01:25:20.071
<i>But there's a man with a gun?</i>

01:25:20.158 --> 01:25:21.377
<i>And he's dangerous?</i>

01:25:21.899 --> 01:25:23.596
Well, he... he might... Uh.

01:25:23.683 --> 01:25:26.295
No, he... he's not necessarily
gonna hurt anyone, so--

01:25:26.382 --> 01:25:27.687
<i>But he has a gun?</i>

01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:29.689
<i>And he's threatening people
with the gun?</i>

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:33.606
Uh, no. Uh. Well, yes, he has
a gun but he...

01:25:33.693 --> 01:25:35.391
Yeah, I'm...
I'm in the bathroom right now.

01:25:35.478 --> 01:25:36.957
I have to go back out there.

01:25:37.044 --> 01:25:38.437
<i>Please stay
on the line if you can.</i>

01:25:38.568 --> 01:25:40.091
What's the address?

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.226
Uh, I don't... I don't know.
It's the Kutzburg Diner.

01:25:44.313 --> 01:25:45.879
It's off of Route 100.
Just come quick.

01:27:12.096 --> 01:27:13.184
Benson.

01:27:14.881 --> 01:27:16.361
What?

01:27:18.755 --> 01:27:24.456
I need to talk to you.

01:27:26.502 --> 01:27:29.026
We need another minute.

01:27:29.331 --> 01:27:30.462
You don't know me.

01:27:31.724 --> 01:27:33.117
You don't know me at all.

01:27:33.944 --> 01:27:38.905
And for you to insinuate
that I've wasted my life or...

01:27:39.993 --> 01:27:43.606
or that I'm not a good mother
is wrong.

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:47.044
To say those things
to someone you don't even know,

01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:49.351
- that's wrong.
- Come on, Marsha.

01:27:49.438 --> 01:27:50.613
- It's time to head home.
No!

01:27:52.354 --> 01:27:56.140
I've sacrificed a lot in life.
I have.

01:27:56.923 --> 01:27:59.665
For you to come in here
and say those things is wrong.

01:28:00.013 --> 01:28:00.971
You're wrong.

01:28:01.841 --> 01:28:03.539
Leave these men alone.
I want this man to leave!

01:28:03.843 --> 01:28:06.063
I don't want him served
in this restaurant!

01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:09.240
- Sweetheart.
- I'm not going! He's going!

01:28:09.893 --> 01:28:11.590
- Take back what you said!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:28:13.636 --> 01:28:16.421
Back up! Back the fuck up!

01:28:16.508 --> 01:28:18.467
You, get the fuck
out of here now!

01:28:18.554 --> 01:28:20.207
On the ground.

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:22.340
On the ground!
Don't fucking look at me!

01:28:22.427 --> 01:28:23.602
Get on the ground.

01:28:23.863 --> 01:28:26.953
I was making a fucking point.

01:28:27.476 --> 01:28:30.522
It had nothing to do with you.
Do you fucking understand me?

01:28:30.609 --> 01:28:32.437
I don't give a fuck
about your life!

01:28:32.524 --> 01:28:34.221
Benson.
- What?

01:28:35.005 --> 01:28:38.922
You have to stop.

01:28:39.357 --> 01:28:43.840
What the f... What?
There's no...

01:28:43.927 --> 01:28:45.407
there's no point
to what you're doing.

01:28:49.193 --> 01:28:50.325
You told me...

01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:52.849
Benson, you told me this woman

01:28:52.936 --> 01:28:55.025
would never do anything
about what you said,

01:28:55.112 --> 01:28:56.983
and she just did,
and you shot her for it.

01:28:57.114 --> 01:28:58.507
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

01:28:58.594 --> 01:29:00.117
You're doing this shit
right now?

01:29:00.204 --> 01:29:01.858
You've got
this whole fucked-up worldview,

01:29:01.945 --> 01:29:03.686
like you've got it all
figured out, Benson, BENSON: Fuck!

01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.776
But I've been sitting
next to you all day,

01:29:07.254 --> 01:29:08.168
watching you drive

01:29:08.647 --> 01:29:10.214
around the same roads
you've been driving around

01:29:10.301 --> 01:29:11.650
your whole life--Who the fuck are you?

01:29:11.781 --> 01:29:14.523
Who the fuck are you to talk
to me like this right now?

01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:16.568
After everything
I've fucking done for you!

01:29:16.655 --> 01:29:19.397
- Listen, Benson.
I am fucking listening
to you, Randy!

01:29:19.484 --> 01:29:22.531
No.

01:29:25.272 --> 01:29:29.625
Listen.

01:29:29.712 --> 01:29:30.800
Listen.

01:29:36.458 --> 01:29:38.808
Oh, shit.

01:29:42.028 --> 01:29:46.598
Fuck. Okay.
What the f...

01:29:47.207 --> 01:29:49.775
Who called 'em? Who called 'em?

01:29:52.343 --> 01:29:56.086
Who called 'em?

01:29:56.347 --> 01:29:59.524
It was you.
It was you, wasn't it?

01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:02.309
It was you, wasn't it,
you fucking bitch?

01:30:02.571 --> 01:30:04.616
- You fucking bitch!
No, Benson, wai--

01:30:08.664 --> 01:30:10.535
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:30:10.622 --> 01:30:13.843
Fuck. Fuck. Stupid.
- Get a fucking-- Get something!
Okay.

01:30:14.017 --> 01:30:16.846
Shit!  Goddamn it!

01:30:16.933 --> 01:30:19.326
Why the fuck did you
do that, you fucking idiot?

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:21.807
Here. Here.

01:30:22.155 --> 01:30:23.330
Fuck.

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.681
Fuck, Randy. I'm sorry.

01:30:26.029 --> 01:30:28.031
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry. Fuck.

01:30:28.597 --> 01:30:30.294
Oh, fuck, fuck.

01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:34.559
I did it. I did it.

01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:39.608
I did it.
I called the... cops.

01:30:39.695 --> 01:30:42.132
I called...
I called the cops.

01:30:44.961 --> 01:30:46.528
I c... I called the cops.

01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:08.375
It was me.

01:31:11.727 --> 01:31:14.207
It was me.

01:31:27.003 --> 01:31:28.483
You're still in charge, Benson.

01:32:02.212 --> 01:32:03.866
You know, when I was a kid...

01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:13.963
...I went to the zoo
on a class trip.

01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:27.846
And when I came home...

01:32:32.329 --> 01:32:35.114
I decided I wanted
to be a giraffe when I grew up.

01:32:42.774 --> 01:32:43.601
Hmm.

01:33:01.532 --> 01:33:03.316
I was never in charge, Randy.

01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:34.130
Benson.

01:33:34.913 --> 01:33:37.133
Hands up!
Get on the ground!

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:39.918
- Get on the fucking ground now!
Get your hands up now!

01:33:40.005 --> 01:33:41.441
Gun! Gun! Gun!
Gun! Gun!

01:33:51.887 --> 01:33:56.021
Do not move!
- Stay right there.
- Do not move your fucking hands!

01:33:57.893 --> 01:34:01.070
Okay, don't move.

01:34:42.067 --> 01:34:44.026
<i>Now you're just
playing with the eraser.</i>

01:34:45.027 --> 01:34:46.158
Flick it right through.

01:34:47.856 --> 01:34:49.509
- Like this?
Yeah.

01:34:51.076 --> 01:34:54.384
Nice. That was... that was
pretty impressive, I must say.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.170
Give it a really good flick.

01:34:58.257 --> 01:34:59.737
- That was a really good flick.
I'm home.

01:34:59.868 --> 01:35:01.391
Mom!

01:35:02.653 --> 01:35:05.395
Hi, baby.

01:35:05.482 --> 01:35:07.005
Can you help me put this away
in the kitchen?

01:35:07.092 --> 01:35:08.485
Yeah.
- Just a second.

01:35:12.619 --> 01:35:13.664
Hi, Mom.

01:35:14.534 --> 01:35:16.972
<i>Hi. Randy. Hey, how's--</i>

01:35:17.059 --> 01:35:19.496
It's fine, Mom. I'm just, uh...
just finishing up.

01:35:19.583 --> 01:35:20.671
<i>I was just, um...</i>

01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:23.674
<i>Will you be home for dinner?</i>

01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:25.589
Uh.

01:35:26.024 --> 01:35:28.287
I told you, Mom,
I'm meeting friends.

01:35:28.374 --> 01:35:31.813
<i>Okay, then.
Uh, sounds... sounds good.</i>

01:35:33.379 --> 01:35:35.730
<i>All right, then.</i> I'll see you tonight, Mom.

01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:40.604
<i>I love you.</i> I love you. Bye.

01:35:42.911 --> 01:35:44.129
Here you go.

01:35:44.216 --> 01:35:46.262
Are you sure you're good
for next Tuesday?

01:35:46.349 --> 01:35:48.003
Yep. I'll be here.
- Okay.

01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:49.613
- Bye, Randy.
Bye.

01:35:51.615 --> 01:35:53.748
Uh, hey, Miss Beard.

01:35:54.052 --> 01:35:54.923
Yes?

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.055
Thanks for...

01:35:59.188 --> 01:36:00.798
Thank you.

01:36:02.321 --> 01:36:03.322
You too.

01:36:16.814 --> 01:36:18.424
Okay.

01:36:19.077 --> 01:36:19.991
So...

01:36:21.427 --> 01:36:24.474
if you can do
a good job cleaning up,

01:36:25.170 --> 01:36:27.259
we can make popcorn
for dessert.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.434
