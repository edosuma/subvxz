WEBVTT

01:04.132 --> 01:06.534
Greetings. Thank you.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.607
Thank you so much.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.944
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you so much.

01:16.944 --> 01:18.879
Thank you, thank you.

01:18.879 --> 01:23.584
Welcome to The Grand Tour.
And in this week's programme:

01:25.219 --> 01:27.155
I drive a saloon car.

01:29.823 --> 01:33.527
James drives
a catering lorry.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.698
And Richard
has a knife fight.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.667
Let's dance.

01:41.169 --> 01:43.704
That is all to come,
but first of all,

01:43.704 --> 01:46.774
let me talk you through where
we are. It's South Africa.

01:46.774 --> 01:50.077
Over there, in the distance,
you can see Johannesburg.

01:50.077 --> 01:54.782
But this place here is called
The Cradle of Humankind.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.818
Now it's called that
because archaeologists
have determined

01:57.818 --> 02:03.191
it was on this very spot
that mankind separated
from the ape.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.459
Ahem.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.063
Well, I mean...

02:12.400 --> 02:14.202
See? We haven't even begun.

02:14.202 --> 02:15.569
- Be reasonable.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.005
You've learnt to put socks on,

02:18.005 --> 02:19.540
but other than that, mate...

02:19.540 --> 02:21.575
Listen, I'm trying to be
profound here, OK?

02:21.575 --> 02:23.511
- Carry on, carry on.
- I'm trying to be profound.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.246
Because this is ground zero.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.748
This is where all
of human history began.

02:27.748 --> 02:31.319
Anyone who comes here,
it's like coming home.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.221
- Jeremy.

02:33.221 --> 02:36.624
How long has it taken some of
us to evolve from being apes?

02:36.624 --> 02:38.926
- It's taken

02:38.926 --> 02:42.230
two million and a hundred...

02:49.603 --> 02:53.474
You at home may be
wondering why everybody
here is applauding,

02:55.909 --> 02:58.979
but it's because
while the rest of mankind

02:58.979 --> 03:02.716
has managed to grasp
the concept of arithmetic,

03:02.716 --> 03:05.753
the President of South
Africa, Jacob Zuma...

03:05.753 --> 03:07.855
Well, how can I put this?
He sort of hasn't.

03:07.855 --> 03:10.924
I've got a clip here to show
you what I'm on about.

03:10.924 --> 03:15.596
We announce that our
membership figures

03:16.797 --> 03:21.134
stood at...769,

03:21.134 --> 03:22.970
eight-hundred and...

03:25.639 --> 03:27.174
700...

03:28.676 --> 03:30.444
Listen properly.

03:30.444 --> 03:35.783
769 thousand,

03:35.783 --> 03:38.786
820...

03:44.558 --> 03:47.295
I mean, honestly.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.198
The funny thing is...

03:51.198 --> 03:54.668
Jacob Zuma is a bit of
a controversial figure here.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.305
He recently installed a
swimming pool at his home.

03:57.305 --> 04:00.974
And then, because he'd used
taxpayers' money to do that,

04:00.974 --> 04:05.746
he said it was actually
a water storage facility
in case of a fire.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.649
So, in other words,
if he burst into flames,

04:08.649 --> 04:10.784
he can jump into it
and put himself out

04:10.784 --> 04:15.122
in ten hundred and...
three hundred...seconds.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.357
He has also bought himself

04:16.357 --> 04:18.125
what he claims
is a fire engine.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.927
Nice.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.431
He's also got himself
an ambulance.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.534
Yep. Can't be too careful.

04:26.534 --> 04:28.836
Motoring in South Africa.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.171
Big problem here, of course,
is the wildlife,

04:31.171 --> 04:33.874
because how do you
accurately warn motorists

04:33.874 --> 04:36.510
that there may be
a deer-y thing ahead

04:36.510 --> 04:38.912
and it could be
full of helium?

04:40.047 --> 04:41.715
Well, the authorities
have had a go.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.617
They've come up with
this as a sign.

04:43.617 --> 04:47.187
It's not bad, except
they've got the word wrong.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.092
What?

04:52.092 --> 04:53.494
It's wrong, isn't it?

04:53.494 --> 04:55.195
- It's not baboons.
- No, it's not.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.898
We're from England.
We know that's not a baboon.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.202
Baboons are actually
very dangerous here.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.173
Certainly,
they've got a better idea

05:06.173 --> 05:09.242
of how to handle a gun
than the local police.

05:11.379 --> 05:14.848
He's actually using that
as a shooting stick.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.817
Shall we get on
with the show?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.387
- Yes, good idea. Good plan.
- Yes, let's.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.854
And we start
with Aston Martin.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.223
The company must have had
a meeting recently

05:23.223 --> 05:24.725
and the bosses
must have said,

05:24.725 --> 05:26.059
"It's gonna be
a few years now

05:26.059 --> 05:27.761
"until the next
Bond film is out,

05:27.761 --> 05:29.797
"so what are we gonna do
at Aston Martin

05:29.797 --> 05:32.032
to generate some headlines
in the meantime?"

05:32.032 --> 05:33.934
And what they must
have decided is,

05:33.934 --> 05:36.203
to make a car that is
as good as a car can be.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.472
They weren't talking
about making a racing car

05:38.472 --> 05:39.707
because in racing
there are rules

05:39.707 --> 05:41.509
about how big
the engine can be

05:41.509 --> 05:43.110
and what sort of tyres
you can use.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.978
And they weren't talking
about making a road car,

05:44.978 --> 05:47.881
that would have to meet
emissions regulations,

05:47.881 --> 05:50.451
have comfy rubber bits
in the suspension.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.085
And all that stuff
would slow it down.

05:52.085 --> 05:53.754
Exactly. They wanted
to make a car

05:53.754 --> 05:56.424
that adhered to no rules
and no regulations.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.492
So they have.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.438
This is what
they came up with.

06:16.444 --> 06:20.448
It costs £1.8 million.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.084
And it's called the Vulcan.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.789
Spectacular, isn't it?

06:33.627 --> 06:35.729
But not very practical.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.084
Oh, God. Ow!

06:57.084 --> 06:59.052
Agh!

07:02.990 --> 07:05.392
Hold on... Nope.

07:05.392 --> 07:08.295
How are you...?

07:08.295 --> 07:09.497
No.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.131
Agh!

07:11.131 --> 07:13.867
Now I'm totally stuck.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.270
Oh, yeah.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.709
You will be able to edit
this out, won't you?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.677
I don't want people
thinking I'm fat.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.115
Right. I'm gonna pop it
into gear now.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.518
You may hear this
a little bit.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.591
Good. First.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.893
Er...foot on clutch.

07:39.893 --> 07:44.698
And now it's time to fire up
the seven-litre V12.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.918
It's quite normal.

08:15.563 --> 08:20.167
When I got going, things
didn't get much better.

08:24.104 --> 08:28.341
Even at slow speeds,
it is quite loud in here,

08:28.341 --> 08:31.645
which is why I'm wearing
this silly face microphone

08:31.645 --> 08:34.715
so you can hear
what I'm on about.

08:34.715 --> 08:39.119
The noisiest part
of this car, however,
is not the engine.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.095
That's the brakes.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.099
They are quite...
They are quite squeaky.

08:56.336 --> 08:59.607
It actually sounds like
I'm stamping on a piglet.

09:01.709 --> 09:05.613
And things get worse
when you put your foot down.

09:11.719 --> 09:14.021
I'm not going to say
that it's like

09:14.021 --> 09:17.224
being attacked
by a bear because it isn't.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.661
But it is like being
in a room with a bear

09:20.661 --> 09:23.631
that's thinking
of attacking you.

09:23.631 --> 09:28.802
At the moment I've turned the
engine down on this knob here

09:28.802 --> 09:30.638
to its minimum setting.

09:30.638 --> 09:33.907
It's only producing
500 horsepower.

09:35.308 --> 09:38.979
So it's not really
the speed that's scary.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.714
Oh, God!

09:40.714 --> 09:43.216
It's the noise
and the harshness

09:43.216 --> 09:45.252
and the vibrations.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.492
It's not a very well-equipped
car either.

09:52.492 --> 09:55.528
The windows don't wind down,
for instance.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.698
There are no toys at all.

09:57.698 --> 10:01.001
And you only get
half a steering wheel.

10:04.805 --> 10:07.107
However, there is
one amazing thing

10:07.107 --> 10:10.010
you get for
your £1.8 million.

10:10.010 --> 10:14.181
An all-expenses-paid trip to
a racetrack of your choice,

10:14.181 --> 10:16.016
where an Aston Martin
test driver

10:16.016 --> 10:18.318
will teach you
how to drive your car,

10:18.318 --> 10:21.755
not with the engine wound
down to 500 horsepower,

10:21.755 --> 10:24.624
but with it turned up...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.326
...to the max.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.774
Holy cow! Ha-ha-ha!

10:44.978 --> 10:50.050
The engine is now
producing 820 horsepower.

10:50.050 --> 10:54.654
And the speed
just beggars belief.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.191
The bear is in attack mode.

11:00.360 --> 11:06.199
The figures say it'll do
0-60 in 2.9 seconds.

11:06.199 --> 11:11.271
And has a top speed of 208
with that wing on the back.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.775
But it feels a hell of a lot
faster than that.

11:14.775 --> 11:17.010
Oh, God!

11:24.985 --> 11:26.987
The other thing
you get for your money

11:26.987 --> 11:28.789
is a squadron of mechanics.

11:31.624 --> 11:35.462
But sadly... not a handbrake.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.299
Right, what I've done now
is I've taken... yes...

11:39.299 --> 11:41.634
I've taken the
steering wheel off,

11:41.634 --> 11:44.772
so I can't put it in gear
to stop it rolling away.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.375
Oh, God.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.510
Agh.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.445
Argh, argh...

11:55.916 --> 11:58.218
When I'd finally
got it to stop,

11:58.218 --> 12:03.056
the jacks were deployed and
the mechanics set to work.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.592
That's the thing
about the Vulcan.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.361
Wing angle, roll bar,
suspension, brakes.

12:08.361 --> 12:13.801
Everything can be adjusted
to suit your personal taste.

12:13.801 --> 12:17.070
After ten minutes
of pretending I knew
what they were doing,

12:17.070 --> 12:19.339
I was back on the track.

12:22.843 --> 12:27.948
And the car felt...
just as bonkers
as it had done before.

12:29.682 --> 12:33.220
However, I've changed.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.357
I've been driving
this thing now,

12:37.357 --> 12:39.259
I don't know,
three or four hours,

12:39.259 --> 12:42.295
and I'm starting to...
understand it.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.097
I'm starting to
get used to it.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.835
I'm starting to trust it.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.039
Now I'm starting
to understand...

12:52.039 --> 12:53.907
why the Vulcan can go round

12:53.907 --> 12:57.244
the Nardo handling circuit
in southern Italy

12:57.244 --> 13:02.850
nine seconds faster
than the McLaren P1.

13:02.850 --> 13:07.420
Nine seconds in car time,
that's a year!

13:12.926 --> 13:14.895
You get phenomenal
mechanical grip

13:14.895 --> 13:16.864
in the low-speed corners,

13:16.864 --> 13:18.631
and then,
on the Isn't Straight,

13:18.631 --> 13:21.201
you've got a ton-and-a-half
of downforce,

13:21.201 --> 13:23.336
thanks to its aerodynamics.

13:26.373 --> 13:31.078
Then you have the power
from the engine,

13:31.078 --> 13:34.882
which feels,
well, old-fashioned.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.416
Proper.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.652
I'm surprised it
doesn't have carburettors.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.390
I love this thing very much.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.662
And what I love most of all

13:49.662 --> 13:51.798
is that it's not a test bed.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.903
It's not an example
of what cars will be like
in the future.

13:55.903 --> 14:00.140
It's a celebration of what
they were like in the past.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.911
What it is...

14:03.911 --> 14:06.079
is old time rock'n'roll.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.220
- Thank you, thank you.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.422
Thank you very much.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.393
- So...

14:20.393 --> 14:22.662
I get the impression
you quite liked the car.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.431
Oh, it's unbelievable.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.499
What I loved most of all is
they've made it out of bits

14:26.499 --> 14:28.601
that they already had
lying around in the factory.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.103
It's like you going home

14:30.103 --> 14:31.939
after your tripto South Africa,
opening the fridge,

14:31.939 --> 14:33.273
and using what's there

14:33.273 --> 14:35.208
to make a delicious
shepherd's pie.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.945
What, some stale milk
and an old piece of cheese?

14:39.346 --> 14:41.982
- Yes.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.616
How much is that,
Jeremy, in rand?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.953
Ten hundred and 30 million
and a million.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.824
But for that it does
0

14:51.824 --> 14:55.963
So it's nearly as fast as an
Aventador or a Caterham R600,

14:55.963 --> 14:57.497
or an Ariel Atom V8,

14:57.497 --> 14:59.967
but much more expensive!

14:59.967 --> 15:02.135
And not road legal.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.837
Yes. Thank you very much
for relieving yourself
all over my enthusiasm.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.273
- You're welcome.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.108
It is a brilliant,
brilliant car.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.977
And only one question
now remains.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.712
How fast will it go
round our track

15:12.712 --> 15:14.614
in the hands of a man

15:14.614 --> 15:19.052
who thinks that
everything British
is basically communist?

15:19.052 --> 15:20.820
Here he is.

15:20.820 --> 15:24.124
Looking a bit confused.

15:24.124 --> 15:28.261
All right, folks, let's see
what this bag of bolts
will do.

15:28.261 --> 15:33.133
JEREMY: And he's off,
and immediately on
to the Isn't Straight.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.768
First corner coming up.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.072
And he's flat through there.
That is ballsy.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.708
Changing down, though,
for the second corner

15:41.708 --> 15:43.110
on the Isn't Straight,

15:43.110 --> 15:44.677
but now he can use
full power.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.579
800 brake horsepower?

15:46.579 --> 15:49.016
Are you kiddin' me?

15:49.016 --> 15:53.586
JEREMY: Now, hard on the
brakes for Your Name Here.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.888
He has got to be
impressed with this.

15:55.888 --> 16:01.194
For about $50,000, I could
get one of my old trucks
NASCAR style.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.430
It's got
800 brake horsepower.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.599
Go deer hunting,

16:06.599 --> 16:08.801
you got room for
a couple deer in the back.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.438
I don't think you can put
no deer in this thing.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.106
JEREMY: Plenty of deer
to run over, though,

16:13.106 --> 16:15.575
back on the Isn't Straight.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.211
James Bond
drives one of these.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.448
Shit. Vin Diesel
would whip his ass.

16:21.448 --> 16:24.484
JEREMY: Yes, I'm sure he
would, but down into first.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.654
- I don't know
about this thing.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.057
It's like a red-headed
stepchild I'm talkin'.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.926
Be damn ugly.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.963
JEREMY: Not sure
he's fully concentrating
past Old Lady's House.

16:36.963 --> 16:40.267
But he is flat out
towards Substation.
It is bumpy here.

16:40.267 --> 16:43.903
And there's new Tarmac
on the apex.
Will it kick the tail out?

16:43.903 --> 16:46.273
Yes, it does indeed. He's OK.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.475
Into Field of Sheep.
No sheep today.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.976
And he's across the line.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.182
Hell of a track, though.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.550
- It is a hell of a track.
- Big car.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.720
Anyway, we must now
bring up the lap board

17:00.720 --> 17:04.691
and find out how fast
the American got round
in the Vulcan.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.194
Let's have a look.
Ooh, it's quick.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.996
RICHARD:
Oh, hello. Hello.

17:14.467 --> 17:18.438
There you go, see?
Old time rock'n'roll.

17:18.438 --> 17:22.575
Old time rock'n'roll has
beaten rap and techno.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.677
- And R and B.

17:24.677 --> 17:26.479
- And is now at the top.
- Very good.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.116
Well done, and thank you.
Now we must move on.

17:29.116 --> 17:34.321
It's time for us to take
a gentle stroll down
Conversation Street.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.594
Right, sticking with
Aston Martin,

17:41.594 --> 17:45.165
they've teamed up with Red
Bull Racing to create this.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.934
It's called the 001.

17:47.934 --> 17:53.140
It has a V12, no turbos,
none of that sort of
hybrid witchcraft.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.176
Yet it produces
900 horsepower

17:56.176 --> 18:00.213
in a car that
only weighs 900 kilos.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.815
- Staggering.

18:02.815 --> 18:04.984
Well, more than staggering,
that is a magic figure,

18:04.984 --> 18:07.754
cos that means it has one
horsepower per kilogram.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.956
And no other car
gets close to that.

18:09.956 --> 18:13.893
Not remotely. The Vulcan's
barely half that.
It's staggering.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.364
The only problem I have
with this... and you just
have to look at it.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.666
Another angle we've got here.
Look at that.

18:19.666 --> 18:23.069
You know that car is gonna be
all about aerodynamics

18:23.069 --> 18:25.338
and particularly downforce.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.639
And I hate downforce.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.808
What do you mean,
you hate downforce?

18:28.808 --> 18:33.180
Because they tell you you can
go round a 90-degree bend
at 100mph

18:33.180 --> 18:35.782
because of the weight
of the air pressing down
on the body.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.050
It's like having
an invisible elephant.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.987
- What if the elephant
falls off?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.324
It's not a real elephant!
It can't fall off!

18:44.324 --> 18:46.459
But how can you trust
something you don't see?

18:46.459 --> 18:50.463
Wait. No, I'm with him
because what if you drove
through a sudden vacuum?

18:50.463 --> 18:53.200
Well, that's not gonna happen
either, is it?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.202
Hammond, listen.
There has to be a speed

18:55.202 --> 18:57.003
in a car with active downforce,
like that one,

18:57.003 --> 19:00.573
where you go round a corner
too fast for the tyres,

19:00.573 --> 19:02.242
too fast for the
mechanical grip,

19:02.242 --> 19:05.345
but not fast enough for the
downforce to be working.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.913
So you'd have to say
to the police,

19:06.913 --> 19:09.982
"I crashed because
I wasn't going fast enough."

19:09.982 --> 19:11.384
- It's true.
- Potentially.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.952
There's another point,
actually,

19:12.952 --> 19:14.787
the handling is gonna
depend on the weather.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.690
If it's a really hot day,
the air will be thinner.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.727
- No, thicker.
- No, it's thinner
on a hot day.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.729
See, I'd be messed up already
cos I'd have the wrong...

19:22.729 --> 19:24.564
That's the point.
You got a really hot day,

19:24.564 --> 19:26.366
and you don't really
want to be driving a car

19:26.366 --> 19:27.900
where whether or not
you get round a corner

19:27.900 --> 19:30.002
depends on whether or not
the sun's out.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.673
So you now want
weather forecasts to include
cornering speeds?

19:33.673 --> 19:35.742
It's not just weather.
Altitude.

19:35.742 --> 19:38.445
You could drive that car
round a corner at 100mph

19:38.445 --> 19:40.480
in Holland, sea level,

19:40.480 --> 19:42.282
but, what are we here,
6,000 feet up?

19:42.282 --> 19:43.783
6,000 feet up here.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.085
You'd barely be able
to get round at three mph.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.588
You'd crash it into a tree,
or a visible elephant.

19:48.588 --> 19:51.258
- They are real.

19:51.258 --> 19:54.126
Exactly. I just...
Honestly, downforce...

19:54.126 --> 19:56.763
I don't like having to trust
something you can't see.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.966
- It's like North Korea.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.935
- Or the contraceptive pill.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.173
- That was an overshare.

20:07.173 --> 20:10.743
There's actually another
hyper car I want to draw
your attention to.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.179
- Replacement for the Veyron.
- AUDIENCE: Oooh!

20:13.179 --> 20:15.014
That is the Bugatti Chiron.

20:15.014 --> 20:18.885
It's got a quad turbo
8-litre W16 engine,

20:18.885 --> 20:22.789
which every minute inhales
13,000 gallons of air.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.057
- Just imagine.
- It's unbelievable.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.993
1,500 horsepower.

20:26.993 --> 20:31.431
And the top speed
is limited to 261 mph.

20:31.431 --> 20:35.335
They say it would do 288
but that would be
irresponsible on the road.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.307
It's got diamonds
in the speakers
for better sound quality.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.342
Of course it has, yeah.

20:42.342 --> 20:47.947
Oh, you'll like this. At top
speed, the force on each tyre
is 3,800G.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.449
A man dies at 9G.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.651
If you drive the Chiron
flat out

20:51.651 --> 20:54.086
it'll drain its tank
in nine minutes.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.192
Hang on a minute.
261mph at nine minutes.

21:00.192 --> 21:03.596
That means you'd have to fill
up with fuel every 39 miles.

21:03.596 --> 21:07.334
Well, less - you can't drive
until you run out, you'd have
to look for a petrol station.

21:07.334 --> 21:10.136
Yes, James, it really isn't
a practical car, is it?

21:11.438 --> 21:13.673
Gonna give you the most
amazing stat, though.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.775
It's about the people
who are buying this car.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.744
They've got 200 orders
so far.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.912
And the average person
who's ordered one

21:19.912 --> 21:26.686
already has 64 cars,
three helicopters,
three jets and one yacht.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.187
Zuma.

21:33.393 --> 21:37.029
I reckon he's got one
already.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.499
Didn't say that.
He didn't say that.

21:39.499 --> 21:42.134
Shall we move it on?

21:42.134 --> 21:46.839
In South Africa, there are
35 carjackings every day.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.908
- Every day.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.811
I've got to say, well done,
that's an amazing figure.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.382
I can't believe it. How have
you got time to come here?

21:55.382 --> 21:57.083
Cos you've got stuff to do.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.519
They've all come here
in someone else's car.

22:01.388 --> 22:04.391
But what they don't realise
is they're all walking home.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.992
I've done a bit of research.

22:05.992 --> 22:09.762
The most commonly jacked
cars, carjacked cars,

22:09.762 --> 22:14.133
are the VW Polo, the Toyota
Hiace and the Toyota Hilux.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.935
But they're the best-selling
cars in South Africa.

22:15.935 --> 22:19.105
Exactly. The VW Polo
is the best-selling car
in South Africa.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.707
So why would you buy a car

22:20.707 --> 22:23.943
which increases your chance
of being shot in the head
and your car being stolen?

22:23.943 --> 22:27.880
Why not buy a car that
nobody would want to steal?

22:27.880 --> 22:32.419
No, cos if I lived here,
I'd get something like
a beige Volvo Estate.

22:32.419 --> 22:35.154
- That's just a car you want!

22:35.154 --> 22:37.790
You're using it as an excuse
to get your dream car.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.494
Look, Hammond, I've explained
it to you before.

22:41.494 --> 22:44.831
Having a Volvo Estate
is a bit like needing to go
to the dentist.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.734
It's gonna happen.
Get it over with. Just do it.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.769
I don't want to
get it over with.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.438
That's like going to the
dentist and saying,

22:51.438 --> 22:53.740
"Take all my teeth out cos
they're gonna fall out."

22:53.740 --> 22:56.476
At the barber's:
"Just pull it all out,
it'll fall out anyway."

22:56.476 --> 23:01.180
The doctor: "Stop me being
able to retain my urine.
It's gonna happen, too."

23:01.180 --> 23:04.451
I'm gonna bury myself
and get it all over with
once and for all.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.285
He has got a point,
seriously.

23:06.285 --> 23:08.755
Let's enjoy it before
we have to have the Volvo.

23:08.755 --> 23:12.725
But why do you all buy cars
that you're going to
get carjacked in?

23:12.725 --> 23:14.861
Has anyone got
a Volkswagen Polo here?

23:14.861 --> 23:18.798
You have? Did you buy
that for yourself?

23:18.798 --> 23:20.867
- My dad bought it for me.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.903
- Wow! Oh, nice gift!

23:23.903 --> 23:26.205
What sort of madness is this?

23:26.205 --> 23:29.476
Has anyone got
a Toyota Hilux?

23:29.476 --> 23:31.478
Yeah. This is insanity.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.549
What did you start out
with this morning?

23:36.549 --> 23:38.184
- It's unbelievable.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.086
Anyway, listen,
we gotta move it on.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.288
Because,
here in South Africa,

23:42.288 --> 23:44.791
people have
an interesting approach
to preventing car theft.

23:44.791 --> 23:46.759
Got a picture here
of one man's solution.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.595
RICHARD: That's a python.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.763
Now there's no question
it's gonna work.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.000
I would not steal a car that
had that on the dashboard.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.335
However, a python's
not like a burglar alarm.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.304
You can't turn it off.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.707
When you come back
to your car, how do you say
to the snake,

24:00.707 --> 24:02.408
"It's my car,
don't strangle me."

24:02.408 --> 24:04.043
- You can't.

24:04.043 --> 24:06.078
I'm pretty sure you can't
train a python, can you?

24:06.078 --> 24:08.347
You can't. That's why you
never see sheep snakes

24:08.347 --> 24:10.517
or guide snakes for the blind.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.051
- It'll never happen.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.153
I have to say,

24:14.153 --> 24:16.523
in England, we've got
an even more stupid solution.

24:16.523 --> 24:19.291
This chap's come up with
an idea called "Bike Mine".

24:19.291 --> 24:22.962
I've got a video of him here
explaining how it works.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.633
It can be attached quickly
to protect almost any
personal possession

24:26.633 --> 24:28.701
you store outside
or in a garage or shed.

24:28.701 --> 24:32.371
Its robust steel construction
is covered in a rubber skin

24:32.371 --> 24:34.240
to protect your property.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.876
Bike Mine is safe
because the detonators
are self-contained...

24:36.876 --> 24:39.712
as well as legal
to own and use.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.882
Bike Mine is reliable
because there are
no batteries to run down

24:42.882 --> 24:45.552
and only one moving part.

24:51.558 --> 24:54.561
It's not gonna work.

24:54.561 --> 24:56.328
What I can't understand is,

24:56.328 --> 24:58.865
he said it can also protect
any other personal property
you may have.

25:01.033 --> 25:04.604
"Are you worried about your
child being kidnapped?

25:04.604 --> 25:06.606
Simply hang this bomb
round their neck."

25:08.107 --> 25:10.877
So, moving on,
to Jordan, weirdly,

25:10.877 --> 25:13.780
where the government
has just built a mock town,

25:13.780 --> 25:16.082
so that special forces
from all over the world

25:16.082 --> 25:18.484
can turn up
and have a competition

25:18.484 --> 25:20.653
to see which one is best.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.955
Yes, and this year,
Mr Wilman,

25:22.955 --> 25:26.225
who is the Fat Man
who controls our lives,

25:26.225 --> 25:28.127
decided that us three
should go and take part.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.129
Obviously there'd be
a lot of shooting,

25:30.129 --> 25:32.064
running about
and doing somersaults.

25:32.064 --> 25:34.133
None of which
we'd be any good at.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.770
No, but, the SAS, the world's
first special forces unit,

25:37.770 --> 25:40.139
was created to be fast,

25:40.139 --> 25:42.041
to get into the battle quickly
and then get out again.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.645
So there would also be
a lot of high-speed driving.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.279
- Erm...
- Yes, I know.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.682
That is a bit of a problem.
We'll gloss over that.

25:49.682 --> 25:53.285
Anyway,
we were sent out there
and this is what happened.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.638
JEREMY: This is it.

26:11.638 --> 26:14.741
The special forces training
base deep inside Amman.

26:14.741 --> 26:17.877
The city, obviously,
not... not...

26:17.877 --> 26:22.114
Anyway, arriving now to
demonstrate what we'd have to
do later,

26:22.114 --> 26:25.451
a squad of
special forces soldiers.

26:25.451 --> 26:28.788
They exfoliated from a Black
Hawk helicopter on ropes

26:28.788 --> 26:33.425
and then fought their way
through a terrorist-infested
building.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.400
Their next task
was to steal a car,

26:41.400 --> 26:45.271
which they used
to reach a hijacked airliner.

26:47.573 --> 26:51.143
Here they stormed the cabin,
killed the bad guys...

26:53.680 --> 26:55.347
and rescued a VIP.

26:57.850 --> 27:02.154
There was then
a high-speed car chase
and a running gun battle,

27:02.154 --> 27:04.323
as they escorted
the rescued hostage

27:04.323 --> 27:06.859
to the safety
of a nearby embassy.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.834
JAMES: That was
quite impressive.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.368
Well, it's not like
they were

27:16.368 --> 27:17.837
- using real bullets.
- Yes, they were.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.706
- They were not.
- They were!

27:19.706 --> 27:21.607
Are you saying
that on this,

training ground,

27:24.476 --> 27:27.814

around with real bullets
in these guns?

27:27.814 --> 27:29.248
- Yes.
- Rubbish.

27:32.251 --> 27:35.988
And there you are.
Real bullets.

27:35.988 --> 27:38.090
And I managed
to shoot myself.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.392
- Oh, yeah.

27:40.392 --> 27:41.961
Well, because,
on an assault rifle,

27:41.961 --> 27:43.930
the bullets
come out this side

27:43.930 --> 27:47.066
and I'm a left-handed shot,
so they just go up my arm,
the casings.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.235
You're gonna
be rubbish at this.

27:49.235 --> 27:52.004
Well, I'm not going to be
able to use an assault rifle.

27:52.004 --> 27:54.306
I'm not gonna be able
to storm that airliner.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.943
I'm not gonna be able
to get out of the helicopter.

27:58.577 --> 28:01.147
JEREMY: Fearing that things
may not go well,

28:01.147 --> 28:03.515
we were told to go
and get ready.

28:03.515 --> 28:07.119
And even that
was fraught with difficulty.

28:10.056 --> 28:12.291
Why are you wearing white?

28:12.291 --> 28:14.193
Snow camouflage.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.764
It has never, ever
snowed in Jordan.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.298
I didn't know
where Jordan was.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.333
You're gonna be
quite visible.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.570
At this point,
we received details

28:24.570 --> 28:27.774
of our mission from
our boss, Mr Wilman.

28:27.774 --> 28:30.309
"Each time one of you
is killed,

28:30.309 --> 28:32.779
you all
have to begin again."

28:34.113 --> 28:36.582
So it's like that
Tom Cruise movie.

28:36.582 --> 28:38.017
What, Cocktail?

28:38.017 --> 28:41.187
No, not Cocktail.
Or Rain Man.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.389
This is gonna take forever.

28:51.230 --> 28:54.801
JEREMY: Nevertheless, we were
soon in the helicopter

28:54.801 --> 28:58.270
on our way
to the start of this
important rescue mission.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.808
Let's just get this straight.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.876
When we get over
the building,

29:03.876 --> 29:05.812
we leap out of the door

29:05.812 --> 29:08.014
and grab the rope
and slide down it?

29:08.014 --> 29:10.716
Pretty much, yeah, that's it.
That's how it goes.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.418
You could be leader.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.721
Get out there, show us how
it's done, we will follow.

29:15.721 --> 29:17.356
I don't want to.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.192
I've never climbed a rope
or gone down one in my life.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.828
Well, what a time.
Get on with it.

29:21.828 --> 29:24.096
Why don't you go first?

29:24.096 --> 29:25.865
I can't do that.
I'm scared of heights.

to your men.
- Yeah, exactly.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.840
How high will it be?

29:33.840 --> 29:36.742
- Yeah. You'll be fine.

What happens
if you fell 30 feet?

29:39.745 --> 29:41.247
Would you be going home
with a head wand?

29:41.247 --> 29:43.015
You'd be going home
in this helicopter

29:43.015 --> 29:44.316
but not in that seat.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.152
You'd be in a bucket

the attitude.

- Go down the rope!
- Don't want to do it.

- I don't want to.

tickle you on your belly?

surprisingly easy.

from a BMW 318i.

39:19.324 --> 39:22.060
And I've got to say,
I think that's pretty cool.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.029
- It's brilliant.
- There are lots of these.

39:24.029 --> 39:27.599
I prefer this one, also with
a BMW engine, a V8,

39:27.599 --> 39:29.435
but the bodywork
is made of denim.

39:29.435 --> 39:32.003
- A man of exquisite taste.

39:33.505 --> 39:34.940
I think the best of them all
is so good,

39:34.940 --> 39:36.942
we've actually brought it
into the studio.

39:36.942 --> 39:39.445
Look, it's down here.
Unbelievable, this.

39:39.445 --> 39:42.448
It's a replica
of a Mercedes C9.

39:42.448 --> 39:45.350
Now that, Hammond,
was the car that won

39:45.350 --> 39:48.454
the 24-hour Le Mans race
in 1989.

39:48.454 --> 39:51.490
And it's so amazing,
I've brought out the man
who built it.

39:51.490 --> 39:54.626
Ladies and gentlemen,
give him a warm hand.
Johan Ackermann!

39:54.626 --> 39:56.462
Thank you very much
for coming.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.267
Can I just as--

40:02.267 --> 40:03.769
Can I just ask, Johan,

40:03.769 --> 40:06.872
how did you get
the styling to work?

40:06.872 --> 40:09.708
Well, Jeremy, there was
no drawings on the internet,

40:09.708 --> 40:12.277
so, erm... I got a book
on the dimensions,

40:12.277 --> 40:15.681
but the closest I could get
was a 1:32-scale model.

40:15.681 --> 40:18.049
Hang on, so
you measured your toy car,

40:18.049 --> 40:21.620
multiplied it by 32
and built a full-sized one.

40:21.620 --> 40:22.954
- Yep.

40:22.954 --> 40:25.691
- Fully road legal.

40:25.691 --> 40:27.726
- It's a real car,
not a model?
- Yeah.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.795
How long did you spend
building this?

40:29.795 --> 40:32.531
From start to roadworthy
was 16 months.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.800
Right. Was there,
or is there,

40:34.800 --> 40:36.602
a marriage
to have survived this?

40:37.569 --> 40:39.571
Well, I hope so.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.139
My wife is here,
so it must be a good sign.

40:41.139 --> 40:44.209
- Hello, patient lady.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.545
Well, it's a remarkable
achievement, and well done.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.079
Ladies and gentlemen,
Johan Ackermann.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.582
- That's brilliant.

40:50.582 --> 40:52.551
Brilliant.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.056
We're moving on
to a great idea

40:58.056 --> 41:01.392
that Richard Hammond and I
have had all by our own.

41:01.392 --> 41:03.629
- And it is brilliant.
- It is.

41:03.629 --> 41:07.533
It's called, Making James May
Do Something He Doesn't
Want To Do.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.602
And we kick off
with spinning.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.704
It's a South African thing.
Fairly simple.

41:12.704 --> 41:14.740
You get an elderly
rear-wheel-drive car,

41:14.740 --> 41:17.743
take it to a car park where
you do doughnuts in it

41:17.743 --> 41:19.911
to a backdrop
of strong rap music.

41:21.847 --> 41:24.449
It's lively,
it's interesting,
and it's youthful.

41:24.449 --> 41:26.552
It's everything he isn't.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.838
Well, here we are, then,

41:46.838 --> 41:49.474
at one of Jo'burg's top
spinning destinations,

41:49.474 --> 41:52.711
the aptly-named
Wheelz 'n' Smoke Arena.

41:52.711 --> 41:54.813
And the object
of the exercise,

41:54.813 --> 41:56.347
as far as I can make out,

41:56.347 --> 41:58.584
is to create smoke.

42:01.587 --> 42:03.288
And drive round
and round the arena

42:03.288 --> 42:05.323
until the tyres go bang.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.994
And then what's left
of the tyres

42:08.994 --> 42:10.862
are put on a bonfire
over there,

42:10.862 --> 42:13.431
to make sure there's
absolutely nothing left.

42:22.874 --> 42:27.813
This is Stacy, and
she's only about 17, I think.

42:27.813 --> 42:30.115
And the word round here
and the noise in the crowd

42:30.115 --> 42:32.117
says that Stacy is
actually very good at this.

42:32.117 --> 42:35.621
But how the bloody hell would
I know? It's just a massive
cloud of smoke...

42:37.288 --> 42:39.457
...with some headlights
occasionally appearing in it.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.394
To help me get into
the spirit of things,

42:43.394 --> 42:47.298
the organisers suggested I
should become more involved.

42:51.336 --> 42:54.072
Aaaargh!

42:57.342 --> 43:00.511
Look at the rev case,
in the red constantly, mate.

43:03.148 --> 43:06.251
I don't like the smell of
tyre smoke in the evening.

43:07.719 --> 43:09.888
Oi! Get back in!

43:11.389 --> 43:13.825
Get back in the car,
you  idiot!

43:15.293 --> 43:16.995
Help!

43:24.535 --> 43:26.672
Thank you.

43:37.983 --> 43:40.085
- Yes.

43:40.085 --> 43:41.286
Finally.

43:58.704 --> 44:00.305
I got 20,000 miles

44:00.305 --> 44:03.709
out of the last set of
rear tyres on my car.

44:32.037 --> 44:34.205
Just go out there and do it.

44:34.205 --> 44:36.141
Fancy trying to do that
in England.

44:36.141 --> 44:38.276
Or anywhere.
Or Australia.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.745
Anyway, mm-mm-mm.

44:39.745 --> 44:43.048
James May, was there any part
of that that you enjoyed?

44:43.048 --> 44:45.316
- Nope.
- Good.

44:45.316 --> 44:48.419
But now it is time
for Celebrity Brain Crash.

44:56.061 --> 44:57.996
Now after what happened
last week,

44:57.996 --> 45:00.365
our guest this week
declined our offer

45:00.365 --> 45:03.068
to arrive at the studio
on a hovercraft,

45:03.068 --> 45:04.870
saying she would prefer
to walk.

45:04.870 --> 45:06.604
- It's understandable.
- Yes, it is.

45:06.604 --> 45:08.306
I'm sure that despite this,

45:08.306 --> 45:11.109
you will still give her
an enormous welcome.

45:11.109 --> 45:14.279
Although she's now
a major Hollywood star,

45:14.279 --> 45:16.681
she was actually born
here in South Africa.

45:16.681 --> 45:19.785
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Charlize Theron!

45:22.653 --> 45:25.991
We must ask her about
A Million Ways To Die
In The West.

45:25.991 --> 45:27.525
I love that film.

45:27.525 --> 45:30.261
But what I really love
is the way she looks in it.

45:30.261 --> 45:34.465
The hat and the floaty skirt.
She's on a bicycle as well.

45:37.468 --> 45:40.405
JEREMY: Oh, no.
RICHARD: Oh, God.

45:41.606 --> 45:44.442
- Oh, not...
- Ladies and gentlemen,

45:44.442 --> 45:46.511
Charlize Theron has been
attacked by a lion.

45:46.511 --> 45:49.314
- Oh, no.
- Literally nothing we can do.

45:51.016 --> 45:52.951
Does that mean
she's not coming on, then?

45:52.951 --> 45:56.121
- She's been eaten by a lion.

45:56.121 --> 45:58.589
Well, look, are there any
other well-known

45:58.589 --> 46:00.191
South Africans
in the audience?

46:00.191 --> 46:02.160
It's not very likely, James.

46:02.160 --> 46:03.995
There's only two globally
famous South Africans.

46:03.995 --> 46:06.832
One's now in a lion
and the other's in prison.

46:08.399 --> 46:10.568
Let's get back
to what we were doing.

46:10.568 --> 46:13.905
Earlier on, we were at
a Jordanian special forces
training base

46:13.905 --> 46:16.407
learning to be
super army soldiers.

46:16.407 --> 46:20.345
And we pick up the action
as we rush towards
the hijacked airliner

46:20.345 --> 46:24.249
to rescue a VIP
and take them to safety.

46:35.861 --> 46:37.863
Let me talk you
through the plan.

46:37.863 --> 46:43.368
James and Richard
will use the catering lorry
as an assault vehicle.

46:43.368 --> 46:45.937
And then,
after we've rescued the VIP,

46:45.937 --> 46:49.975
we'll use the Audi
as a getaway car.

46:54.445 --> 46:57.348
Now what we're doing here,
very cleverly,

46:57.348 --> 46:59.317
is we're going round
the back of the plane

46:59.317 --> 47:02.153
because planes don't have
rear windows

47:02.153 --> 47:05.523
or door mirrors, so they
won't see us sneaking up.

47:05.523 --> 47:07.225
Stealthy, you see.

47:08.459 --> 47:10.795
Hammond,
we're manoeuvring in.

47:10.795 --> 47:13.031
RICHARD: OK.
JAMES: Dab the brakes.

47:16.334 --> 47:18.203
RICHARD: Right,
we are in position.

47:18.203 --> 47:22.773
James is gonna lift me on
this platform to the door,

47:22.773 --> 47:24.309
then we go in.

47:24.309 --> 47:26.611
Right, are you ready?

47:26.611 --> 47:28.479
I'm ready to lower the jacks.

47:28.479 --> 47:29.981
Absolute stealth.

47:41.726 --> 47:43.594
I think the terrorists

47:43.594 --> 47:45.663
are going to notice
this assault.

48:03.714 --> 48:08.553
I think the terrorists are
going to notice this assault.

48:08.553 --> 48:11.656
Which is why I shall now
cause a diversion.

48:14.359 --> 48:17.295
I'm gonna make
a smoking doughnut
in front of the plane

48:17.295 --> 48:19.530
to distract the terrorists.

48:22.433 --> 48:24.769
JEREMY: Oh, no,
this is a disaster.

48:24.769 --> 48:28.073
Even when you turn
the traction control off,

48:28.073 --> 48:29.640
it isn't fully off,

48:29.640 --> 48:34.279
so you just get miles and
miles of dreary understeer.

48:34.279 --> 48:36.481
Bad mark for Audi here.

48:40.285 --> 48:42.320
Come on!

48:42.320 --> 48:44.855
The only good thing is the
terrorists will be looking

48:44.855 --> 48:46.057
out of the cockpit windows

48:46.057 --> 48:48.259
thinking, "Why is that Audi

48:48.259 --> 48:50.996
understeering around
like that?"

48:50.996 --> 48:53.431
Right! Go low!

49:00.005 --> 49:01.439
Here I come!

49:01.439 --> 49:05.076
Cry havoc and let slip
the dog of understeer!

49:20.125 --> 49:23.294
Chaps, I have located the VIP

49:23.294 --> 49:25.430
and it is the Queen
of England.

49:25.430 --> 49:27.465
JAMES: I don't like
the Royal Family.

49:27.465 --> 49:31.036
James, now is not the time
for your republican views.

49:31.036 --> 49:34.272
Ma'am, we are an elite
fighting force.

49:34.272 --> 49:36.041
We have an Audi outside.
We will...

49:40.911 --> 49:42.613
Why did you shoot Hammond?

49:42.613 --> 49:44.315
He was being annoying.

49:48.919 --> 49:51.889
That's how you do it!

49:54.059 --> 49:57.062
Ma'am, we are an elite
fighting force.

49:57.062 --> 49:59.164
We have an Audi outside.
We will...

50:04.435 --> 50:07.138
- Well, he shot me!

50:11.142 --> 50:13.778
- That's how you do it!

50:13.778 --> 50:17.748
Somehow in our next attempt,
Hammond ended up on the wing.

50:19.817 --> 50:25.190
Oh, I see. You wanna do this
the old-fashioned way.

50:25.190 --> 50:27.458
OK, let's dance.

50:29.227 --> 50:30.561
- Aagh!

50:37.235 --> 50:39.970
Ma'am, we are an elite
fighting force.

50:39.970 --> 50:43.774
We have an Audi waiting
outside to get you to safety.

50:43.774 --> 50:46.244
- I just said.

50:46.244 --> 50:48.679
We are an elite
fighting force.

50:48.679 --> 50:51.216
We have an Audi waiting
outside to get you to safety.

50:51.216 --> 50:53.084
- You'll like it, it's German.
- Like you are.

50:53.084 --> 50:56.321
Thank you, James.
Are all the terrorists dead
back there?

50:56.321 --> 50:58.723
- Everybody's dead back there.
- Good man.

50:58.723 --> 51:01.192
Your Majesty,
if you'd like to follow us.

51:11.736 --> 51:14.139
He's just shot the Queen
in the back of the head.

51:14.139 --> 51:16.674
Well, now what we gonna do?

51:18.243 --> 51:20.278
- Oh...

51:23.681 --> 51:27.352
Go. I'll have that,
thank you very much.

51:28.886 --> 51:32.022
Having finally got
the Queen into the car,

51:32.022 --> 51:34.659
we were now faced
with a perilous drive
to the embassy.

51:37.462 --> 51:41.232
However, this did at least
mean I could get back
to my day job.

51:42.833 --> 51:46.704
I'll talk you through the car.
This is the S8 Plus.

51:48.706 --> 51:51.942
Plus means it has
80 more horsepower
than the standard car.

51:51.942 --> 51:55.913
That means 0-60
in 3.8 seconds,

51:55.913 --> 51:58.449
top speed: 190.

51:58.449 --> 52:00.618
How very interesting.

52:04.189 --> 52:07.892
The immense power
is harnessed not only
by all-wheel drive,

52:07.892 --> 52:10.195
but also by ceramic brakes.

52:11.562 --> 52:14.098
And an electronic
differential.

52:14.098 --> 52:17.802
There's a time
and a place for talking
about that stuff, mate!

52:17.802 --> 52:19.770
Sitting behind
a six-foot-five-inch driver

52:19.770 --> 52:22.273
means that rear leg room
is rather at a premium.

52:22.273 --> 52:25.610
Having said that, however,
for a high-performance
saloon,

52:25.610 --> 52:27.678
the ride quality
is really rather good.

52:27.678 --> 52:30.080
Will you two stop
reviewing the car?

52:32.750 --> 52:35.019
Do you have an opinion,
the Queen?

52:35.019 --> 52:36.654
Not now!

52:40.358 --> 52:42.293
Hold it steady,
I'm gonna shoot them.

52:45.463 --> 52:48.366
Shoot him in the face!

52:48.366 --> 52:51.302
Have you come far?

52:56.441 --> 52:59.244
The Living Daylights.
Transporter 2 and 3.

52:59.244 --> 53:00.311
Taken. Ronin.

53:00.311 --> 53:02.313
Why are you listing films?

53:02.313 --> 53:06.517
Because all those films
had a big Audi saloon
in them going quickly.

53:06.517 --> 53:10.388
It is the car of choice
for the Hollywood hero.

53:11.556 --> 53:12.823
Shut up.

53:16.627 --> 53:19.129
What's the top speed
of that thing, James?

53:19.129 --> 53:20.665
About 90 miles an hour.

53:20.665 --> 53:24.335
Well, here is a top tip
for Hollywood heroes.

53:25.603 --> 53:27.372
If you're being
chased by a car

53:27.372 --> 53:29.274
which is slower
than the car you're in,

53:29.274 --> 53:34.279
simply drive faster than it.

53:34.279 --> 53:38.115
See, that's what Nick Cage
ought to have thought about,
really, in The Rock.

53:38.115 --> 53:41.619
And that man in Ronin, with
the S8 chasing the Citroen.

53:41.619 --> 53:43.721
Stop talking about films!

53:43.721 --> 53:45.723
There's a bogey
waxing our tail.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.892
- Oh, God!
- Gonna shoot its petrol tank.

53:47.892 --> 53:52.730
James, there's no point
shooting it. Petrol only
blows up in films.

54:01.706 --> 54:03.941
Well, that's not strictly
accurate.

54:03.941 --> 54:06.777
- Where the bloody hell is
the embassy?
- Go down here.

54:08.313 --> 54:10.315
- No, this is rubbish.
- There it is.

54:10.315 --> 54:11.949
There it is!

54:11.949 --> 54:15.386
Right, you get the Queen
to safety. I'll cover you.

54:15.386 --> 54:17.822
- OK, I'm on it.
- Right, good. Go, go, go!

54:17.822 --> 54:19.089
Go, go, go!

54:19.089 --> 54:20.391
Your Majesty.

54:20.391 --> 54:23.060
Really quickly, Your Majesty.

54:24.995 --> 54:26.030
We can't see.

54:41.011 --> 54:42.547
Come on, Jeremy, come on!

54:42.547 --> 54:44.982
I'm doing my best!

54:46.417 --> 54:48.919
In the plums!

54:48.919 --> 54:50.154
Oh, no!

54:50.154 --> 54:51.622
Just keep moving!

54:54.459 --> 54:56.361
They've done it again!

54:56.361 --> 54:58.396
James, you're missing this!

54:58.396 --> 55:00.431
You cannot modernise
the royalty,

55:00.431 --> 55:05.436
because royalty is,
at the very best,
a medieval concept.

55:07.004 --> 55:08.673
Oh! Shooting!

55:08.673 --> 55:11.542
That's gonna sting!
He's still coming!

55:11.542 --> 55:13.177
Keep going!

55:13.177 --> 55:14.745
Mind the mines!

55:20.585 --> 55:22.186
He's still going!

55:22.186 --> 55:24.822
** [Barber's
"Adagio for Strings"]

55:44.609 --> 55:46.744
James, he's dead.

55:48.513 --> 55:52.249
No, wait a minute.
He's going again!
He's moving again!

55:52.249 --> 55:53.951
Jeremy, come on,
you can do it!

55:53.951 --> 55:56.186
Come on, keep going!
Come on.

55:56.186 --> 55:57.722
- This is it.
- Hammond...

55:57.722 --> 55:59.323
There's the finish line!

55:59.323 --> 56:00.758
Am I going the right way?

56:00.758 --> 56:04.462
More or less. Roll over it.
You can do it.

56:04.462 --> 56:07.164
- Yes! We have done it.

56:11.702 --> 56:13.571
Have you come far?

56:21.245 --> 56:25.850
A fighting force. An
unbelievable fighting force.

56:27.084 --> 56:29.787
We actually managed
to complete that course

56:29.787 --> 56:32.256
in nine hours
and 48 minutes.

56:32.256 --> 56:37.595
And that's only
nine-and-a-half hours slower
than the actual soldiers.

56:37.595 --> 56:39.664
Can I just ask, how many
times were you shot?

56:39.664 --> 56:41.866
- On the way to the embassy.

56:41.866 --> 56:46.136
Er... 17 to the torso,
two to the... plum set.

56:48.038 --> 56:50.475
Well, obviously, James,
yes, look, I lived.

56:50.475 --> 56:54.679
He did. And on that
terrible disappointment,
it is time to end.

56:54.679 --> 56:56.681
Yes, it is. Thank you
so much for watching.

56:56.681 --> 56:59.149
See you somewhere next week.
Goodbye!
