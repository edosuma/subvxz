00:05.274 --> 00:11.080
♪ ♪

00:11.414 --> 00:13.516
JESSI: All right,
got my rifle.

00:13.549 --> 00:15.718
CHRIS: I've got seven
rounds in each mag.

00:15.752 --> 00:18.688
The last time we went out,
we were just carrying
your revolver.

00:18.721 --> 00:21.157
That's what we
had as a side arm.

00:21.576 --> 00:26.447
I feel a lot more comfortable
with 320 grains of awesome.

00:26.095 --> 00:27.997
This is a really big bear.

00:28.031 --> 00:29.766
So, we're going out heavy.

00:29.799 --> 00:33.102
You got a couple mags,
you've got a long gun.

00:34.303 --> 00:37.006
Jess and I had decided
to try to walk up to
our trapping area.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.474
Totally not a
care in the world.

00:38.508 --> 00:39.976
Dog's having a
really good time.

00:40.009 --> 00:41.244
Jessi and I are singing.

00:41.277 --> 00:43.212
Uh, we round a corner and
I look up and there is the

00:43.246 --> 00:45.348
biggest damn black
bear I've ever seen.

00:45.381 --> 00:47.950
And we make eye contact.

00:48.351 --> 00:52.055
He started raking at the
ground and he's snorting at us.

00:52.688 --> 00:55.124
As we start to backpedal away,
the faster we move,

00:55.158 --> 00:56.459
the faster this bear moves.

00:56.492 --> 00:58.995
He's about 50 feet from
us and just tracking
us through the woods.

00:59.028 --> 01:01.564
The dog's dancing back
and forth trying to
keep the bear at bay.

01:01.597 --> 01:03.099
Fear's coursing
through our veins.

01:03.132 --> 01:05.034
We're finally close to
home and the bear had no fear

01:05.068 --> 01:07.236
coming all the way
up to our doorstep.

01:07.270 --> 01:09.472
That means this
bear's been here before.

01:09.505 --> 01:11.874
I know that bear's
lurking and watching me
from the wood line.

01:11.908 --> 01:13.776
I know he's out
there watching me.

01:13.810 --> 01:16.512
We're gonna have to do
something about this bear.

01:25.021 --> 01:26.622
Yeah, I'm done just
looking over my shoulder.

01:26.656 --> 01:28.191
He's the biggest
predator out here,

01:28.224 --> 01:30.626
and right now I feel
like safety is paramount.

01:30.660 --> 01:32.628
Honestly, I hope he's
denned up for the winter.

01:34.831 --> 01:35.898
JESSI: All right.

01:35.932 --> 01:37.100
CHRIS: Let's get
everything loaded up.

01:37.133 --> 01:39.001
NARRATOR: When bears are
supposed to be hibernating,

01:39.035 --> 01:42.638
an encounter with the
predator is cause for concern.

01:42.672 --> 01:45.108
In order to protect
themselves and their property,

01:45.141 --> 01:48.611
Chris and Jessi must make
sure the bear is not a threat.

01:48.644 --> 01:51.914
But with Chris' recent leg
injury limiting his mobility,

01:51.948 --> 01:55.017
they need to exercise
extreme caution while

01:55.051 --> 01:57.186
going on the defense.

01:59.489 --> 02:02.592
CHRIS: If this gets
out of control, and he
is coming toward us,

02:02.625 --> 02:04.160
we're gonna have to
stand our ground,

02:04.193 --> 02:05.528
no matter how close he gets.

02:05.561 --> 02:06.896
Keep your eyes on the bear.

02:06.929 --> 02:09.132
Don't turn your back to him.

02:09.165 --> 02:12.802
Um, we've got plenty of
ammo and this isn't just our,

02:12.835 --> 02:14.237
our average hunt.

02:14.270 --> 02:16.339
Um, we're not just
going out after food.

02:16.372 --> 02:18.307
I mean, we are
protecting our territory.

02:18.341 --> 02:20.810
This is our life
out here and, um,

02:20.843 --> 02:23.246
I wanna defend my house and I
wanna go out and show the bear

02:23.279 --> 02:26.282
that we also mean business.

02:26.315 --> 02:27.517
JESSI: Now I know he's there.

02:27.550 --> 02:29.352
We're going with a purpose.

02:29.385 --> 02:30.786
CHRIS: You feel
good about this?

02:30.820 --> 02:32.688
JESSI: Feel better
than last time.

02:32.722 --> 02:35.024
CHRIS: All right.

02:44.267 --> 02:46.636
KALEB: This is a
spectacular place to live,

02:46.669 --> 02:50.840
but there are powerful forces
at play that just don't care

02:50.873 --> 02:53.242
if you survive or not.

03:04.854 --> 03:07.623
Well, hey!
Guys look at this.

03:07.657 --> 03:10.726
These are old fox tracks.

03:12.662 --> 03:13.930
Piper!

03:13.963 --> 03:15.464
BRITTANY: Think
she got the scent?

03:15.498 --> 03:16.766
KALEB: I think she did.

03:16.799 --> 03:18.968
BRITTANY: Let's go find a place
to put that rabbit snare up.

03:19.001 --> 03:20.870
ELOVIE: Yeah.

03:20.903 --> 03:23.739
NARRATOR: In the isolated
town of McCarthy, Alaska,

03:23.773 --> 03:27.109
Brittany and Kaleb Rowland
have chosen to bring up

03:27.143 --> 03:29.679
their children,
Gilbert and Elovie,

03:29.712 --> 03:32.748
away from the
commotion of the city.

03:33.416 --> 03:35.885
But with a tough Alaskan
winter on the horizon,

03:35.918 --> 03:38.187
homeschooling means
more than just

03:38.221 --> 03:41.023
reading, writing,
and arithmetic.

03:42.858 --> 03:45.795
BRITTANY: Living out here, we
have different things that we

03:45.828 --> 03:47.163
need to know how to do.

03:47.196 --> 03:49.899
But we're now going
to work on snares.

03:49.932 --> 03:52.401
If we lived in the city, there
would be other skill sets that

03:52.435 --> 03:54.971
we would need, such as
learning the bus system,

03:55.004 --> 03:57.206
and out here we have a
set of rural skills;

03:57.240 --> 04:00.243
getting wood,
getting a fire started,

04:00.276 --> 04:02.411
getting our food,
like things like that.

04:02.445 --> 04:06.515
Everyone has to learn
how to survive in the
atmosphere that they're in.

04:08.184 --> 04:09.652
GILBERT: I have a cool idea.

04:09.685 --> 04:10.653
KALEB: What?

04:10.686 --> 04:13.089
GILBERT: Set a snare
for if Piper goes along,

04:13.122 --> 04:14.323
he'll get trapped.

04:14.357 --> 04:15.925
KALEB: We catch Piper?
GILBERT: Yeah.

04:15.958 --> 04:18.060
KALEB: That's maybe
not such a cool idea.

04:18.094 --> 04:19.929
So Gilbert, we
wanna make a trail.

04:19.962 --> 04:22.932
And animals naturally like
to follow a trail 'cause it's

04:22.965 --> 04:25.635
easier than beatin'
through the deep snow,

04:25.668 --> 04:28.938
so if we have a trail,
they'll follow it,

04:28.971 --> 04:31.207
and then if you have a snare
in the middle of your trail,

04:31.240 --> 04:33.309
they'll walk
through your snare.

04:33.342 --> 04:36.779
So, what we wanna do is we
wanna dangle a snare right

04:36.812 --> 04:39.749
here in this little hole right
here and the animal will come

04:39.782 --> 04:42.151
by it and it'll kinda skirt
these branches here and it'll

04:42.184 --> 04:43.719
go right through our snare.

04:43.753 --> 04:45.888
BRITTANY: What's your first
step for setting a snare?

04:45.921 --> 04:48.324
KALEB: The first thing we need
to do is secure our snare to

04:48.357 --> 04:49.859
that tree right there.

04:49.892 --> 04:50.893
BRITTANY: Okay.

04:50.926 --> 04:52.361
KALEB: The
snare's all wrapped up.

04:52.395 --> 04:54.830
Who wants to unwrap it?

04:55.197 --> 04:57.900
We're also gonna get a little
bit of wire to secure that

04:57.933 --> 05:00.736
snare to the tree.

05:00.770 --> 05:02.972
Here, hold my
wire for me, please.

05:03.005 --> 05:05.675
We wanna go up higher on
the tree like this so that it

05:05.708 --> 05:08.577
wants to lift the
animal off the ground.

05:08.611 --> 05:10.046
Look at this, Gilbert.

05:10.079 --> 05:11.814
We're gonna feed this
through the loop here.

05:11.847 --> 05:13.416
It need a little bit of wire.

05:13.449 --> 05:15.017
Secure this to the tree.

05:15.051 --> 05:17.787
Now it's stuck to the
tree, it cannot come off.

05:17.820 --> 05:19.989
Now we'll take a
couple sticks,

05:20.022 --> 05:23.225
and we'll just kinda
use 'em to funnel the
animal into the snare.

05:23.259 --> 05:25.394
You guys wanna
put some sticks in?

05:25.428 --> 05:28.864
Being a father is about
teaching your children how to

05:28.898 --> 05:31.334
survive and live in the world.

05:31.367 --> 05:32.735
ELOVIE: Now I'll try.

05:32.768 --> 05:35.171
KALEB: All right, Ellie, you
get to pretend to be a rabbit.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.106
Here in the bush there is
a lot you gotta teach 'em.

05:37.139 --> 05:40.009
One of the most important
things out here is

05:40.042 --> 05:41.677
how to survive in the woods.

05:41.711 --> 05:44.947
So learning how to do
that at a young age is
the best way to do it.

05:44.980 --> 05:46.582
BRITTANY: That
seems pretty simple.

05:46.615 --> 05:48.084
KALEB: It is fairly simple.

05:48.117 --> 05:50.319
ELOVIE: I hope we get one.

05:50.353 --> 05:52.088
KALEB: All right, let's get
outta here so they don't get

05:52.121 --> 05:53.856
spooked by our scent.

05:53.889 --> 05:55.758
On to the next thing.

05:58.527 --> 06:00.429
MICHAEL: Every time I
repurpose something that's

06:01.544 --> 06:07.883
used and old, I am not feeding
myself and my hours of labor

06:06.836 --> 06:10.573
and work to other
people's systems.

06:10.606 --> 06:12.775
You gotta give the middle
finger to the middle man,

06:12.808 --> 06:15.277
and this is the
way I'm doin' it.

06:20.716 --> 06:22.752
This right here might
not look like much.

06:22.785 --> 06:25.154
This is an old
unused building.

06:25.187 --> 06:27.189
It's been vacant for years.

06:27.223 --> 06:28.591
This has been torn down.

06:28.624 --> 06:30.126
It was a nice
gambrel roof building.

06:30.159 --> 06:33.896
And gambrel roof is like
a barn-style building.

06:33.929 --> 06:38.334
I've been collecting used and
reclaimed building materials

06:38.367 --> 06:41.070
that I either got for
free or gifted to me.

06:42.504 --> 06:48.009
I have a few more
I gotta buzz in to
bite-size manageable pieces,

06:46.642 --> 06:48.177
and I'm gonna take all this,

06:48.210 --> 06:52.214
transport this, uh, half an
hour up the highway and then,

06:52.248 --> 06:56.252
uh, about a mile off the
highway at my basecamp.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.222
Try to reclaim
and use everything,

07:00.256 --> 07:02.391
don't let
anything go to waste,

07:02.425 --> 07:05.728
and that frugality will
keep you moving forward,

07:06.162 --> 07:08.697
keep the bills paid.

07:11.066 --> 07:12.768
I'm gonna feel
that in the mornin'.

07:12.802 --> 07:17.039
The cabin kit from hell,
and soon be my new home.

07:17.807 --> 07:20.976
Living in a shipping container
with two inches of insulation

07:21.010 --> 07:23.312
is not really a
permanent structure.

07:23.345 --> 07:24.847
That was supposed
to be temporary,

07:24.880 --> 07:26.916
like, four years ago.

07:26.949 --> 07:28.818
I'm gonna
actually have a cabin.

07:28.851 --> 07:31.387
It's gonna be
real warm and cozy.

07:31.420 --> 07:33.088
All right.

07:33.122 --> 07:35.224
Home sweet home.

07:35.257 --> 07:37.293
I think.

07:38.561 --> 07:40.196
It's gonna come together nice.

07:40.229 --> 07:43.365
Looks like crap, but
it's beautiful to me.

07:45.401 --> 07:48.737
I'm just about ready to get
all this stuff into a fairly

07:48.771 --> 07:52.141
quaint, cute little
cabin that I'll call home.

07:56.178 --> 07:59.181
Snow is just making
everything crazy.

07:59.448 --> 08:01.584
It's gonna be a little bit of
a challenge puttin' all these

08:01.617 --> 08:06.355
dilapidated pieces of building
back together in the snow,

08:06.388 --> 08:10.960
but, hey, winter is here, I
gotta put this thing together,

08:10.993 --> 08:13.596
and I'll put it together as
quick as I can because the

08:13.629 --> 08:16.799
snow just keeps
fallin' every day.

08:16.832 --> 08:19.502
It's a half a foot now, who's
to say what it's gonna be like

08:19.535 --> 08:20.936
a week from now?

08:20.970 --> 08:22.505
Could be two feet of snow.

08:22.538 --> 08:25.107
And most normal people
don't build in the snow.

08:25.140 --> 08:27.543
You build before first snow.

08:27.576 --> 08:29.778
So It's gonna be
a little hectic.

08:29.812 --> 08:31.280
But you know what?

08:31.313 --> 08:33.649
If there's a will,
there is a way.

08:43.659 --> 08:45.060
ALEX: You don't wanna learn
everything the hard way 'cause

08:45.094 --> 08:47.296
sometimes that could kill you.

08:47.329 --> 08:48.964
You know, it's always
good to think like,

08:48.998 --> 08:52.001
"What can go wrong?
What can go wrong?
What can go wrong?"

09:06.582 --> 09:08.250
Every once in a while we get
a big wind storm that comes

09:08.284 --> 09:10.986
through here, and, uh,
if a tree is kinda old,

09:11.020 --> 09:13.923
rotten, or dead, it
can break, it can fall.

09:13.956 --> 09:17.226
This birch tree, the top of it
broke off in a wind storm and,

09:17.259 --> 09:19.929
uh, smashed half of
my outhouse here.

09:19.962 --> 09:21.397
If I had been in
the outhouse at the time,

09:21.430 --> 09:22.932
it probably
would've killed me.

09:22.965 --> 09:24.900
I'll need to build a
new outhouse right now.

09:24.934 --> 09:26.602
I'm just squattin' in
the woods which is,

09:26.635 --> 09:28.537
uh, not the
funnest way to poop.

09:28.571 --> 09:30.406
Before I do that though,
there's a lot of other trees

09:30.439 --> 09:32.341
that could also be
a similar danger.

09:32.374 --> 09:34.910
If they break, they could
smash my cabin and crush me.

09:34.944 --> 09:37.513
That would be probably
the biggest disaster
I ever faced out here.

09:37.546 --> 09:39.882
So I think it's time to
go and cut these down.

09:42.651 --> 09:43.986
This is my biggest tree.

09:44.019 --> 09:45.154
It weighs several tons.

09:45.187 --> 09:46.589
If it comes through my cabin,

09:46.622 --> 09:48.157
it's not gonna
glance off the side,

09:48.190 --> 09:49.825
it's gonna smash
straight through.

09:49.858 --> 09:52.227
Could most definitely
kill me if it fell on me.

09:54.029 --> 09:55.464
Cuttin' trees is
somethin' I do a lot.

09:55.497 --> 09:56.599
It's somethin'
I'm pretty good at.

09:56.632 --> 09:58.601
But I've never had to cut
a tree where I have to be

09:58.634 --> 10:00.903
extremely careful about
which direction it falls.

10:00.936 --> 10:03.105
In this case, if I
don't control it perfectly,

10:03.138 --> 10:06.609
it could smash my cabin,
and then I'm really
gonna be in trouble.

10:07.876 --> 10:09.545
Okay.

10:09.578 --> 10:11.113
My come-alongs are set up.

10:11.146 --> 10:14.249
Now, all I gotta do
is cut my notches.

10:24.460 --> 10:26.595
It's a good thing
I'm cuttin' this down.

10:26.629 --> 10:28.764
The core of this
tree is rotten.

10:28.797 --> 10:31.533
The next windstorm
could've been it.

10:31.567 --> 10:33.636
Seeing the destruction of my
outhouse makes me realize

10:33.669 --> 10:35.137
how vulnerable I am.

10:35.170 --> 10:37.039
Now any time there's a wind
and the trees are swaying,

10:37.072 --> 10:40.342
and I hear them cracking,
it's anxiety-inducing for me.

10:40.376 --> 10:42.645
This is kinda like nature
giving me a warning shot here,

10:42.678 --> 10:45.214
uh, letting me know that
I'm not important, saying,

10:45.247 --> 10:47.082
"Hey, you better, you know,
get your head on straight,

10:47.116 --> 10:49.752
'cause I'm not playing
around with you."

10:53.355 --> 10:54.723
Okay. It might be a little soon,

10:54.757 --> 10:56.792
but I'm gonna go ahead
and give a tug.

10:56.825 --> 10:59.294
If it starts comin',
I gotta run.

11:01.830 --> 11:04.500
It's movin'.

11:05.401 --> 11:07.536
Oh! That's not good.

11:16.745 --> 11:20.816
ALEX: That's not good.
It's hung up in this tree.

11:20.849 --> 11:23.152
This is dangerous.
It's not good.

11:23.185 --> 11:24.420
Uh, when a tree
hangs up like this,

11:24.453 --> 11:25.721
it's kind of a problem.

11:25.754 --> 11:27.256
The obvious
thing would be like,

11:27.289 --> 11:29.158
"Oh, well, I'll just cut the
tree that it's holding on,"

11:29.191 --> 11:31.360
but then I'm cuttin' the tree
and it's gonna be comin' down,

11:31.393 --> 11:33.195
uh, right where I'm standing.

11:33.228 --> 11:35.631
There's some safer
options I can try first.

11:35.664 --> 11:38.333
The good news is I dropped
the tree away from my cabin,

11:38.367 --> 11:40.169
the way I wanted it to.

11:40.202 --> 11:42.538
Now, the only danger
that remains is to me.

11:42.571 --> 11:44.339
If I'm not smart,
if I'm not cautious,

11:44.373 --> 11:48.510
uh, this is one of those kind
of predicaments that I could

11:48.544 --> 11:50.312
take it from bad
to much worse.

11:50.345 --> 11:52.314
So, that's why I just
wanna be extra cautious.

11:52.347 --> 11:54.850
The first thing that I gotta
do is pull it off this stump.

12:03.826 --> 12:05.461
(bleep).

12:05.494 --> 12:07.096
Stump's coming towards
me and it falls and,

12:07.129 --> 12:08.797
uh, nothing.

12:08.831 --> 12:10.365
Today seems like one of those
days where things aren't gonna

12:10.399 --> 12:13.469
go my way, but that's
okay because I got a plan B.

12:13.502 --> 12:16.071
I'll need my rope,
I'll need my come-along.

12:16.105 --> 12:18.240
I'll just start tuggin' on my
fallen tree and dragging it

12:18.273 --> 12:20.743
off of the tree that
it's being held up on.

12:20.776 --> 12:23.645
You know, I'm cuttin' down a
tree that weighs several tons.

12:23.679 --> 12:26.482
I'll do my best to control it,
but I can't expect everything

12:26.515 --> 12:28.751
to go exactly how
I want it to go.

12:28.784 --> 12:31.420
If I crush my leg or crush
my lungs out here with a

12:31.453 --> 12:33.856
heavy tree, that's
pretty much it.

12:33.889 --> 12:35.824
I'm not gonna crawl
outta here to safety.

12:35.858 --> 12:39.495
I'm just gonna lay there
and bleed until I die.

12:42.498 --> 12:43.866
(bleep) piece of (bleep)!

12:43.899 --> 12:45.467
It's not budging at all.

12:45.501 --> 12:46.869
I've tried my best
to do a simpler,

12:46.902 --> 12:49.705
safer option, uh, but
it's just not working.

12:49.738 --> 12:52.141
So I think my only option
left is to cut the tree

12:52.174 --> 12:55.144
that's holding it.

12:55.177 --> 12:59.181
I just gotta just do this
carefully 'cause basically

12:59.214 --> 13:02.417
I'm standing underneath the
tree and cutting the thing

13:02.451 --> 13:03.952
that's holding it.

13:03.986 --> 13:07.322
So, this is about as, as
stupid dangerous as it gets.

13:10.125 --> 13:15.364
(chopping).

13:18.801 --> 13:21.537
(cracking).

13:22.437 --> 13:23.639
Ah-ha!

13:23.672 --> 13:26.008
I thought it was
coming for me for a second.

13:26.041 --> 13:28.243
Uh, the tree is down
where I wanted it to go.

13:28.277 --> 13:31.480
It didn't crush my cabin,
it didn't crush me and, uh,

13:31.513 --> 13:34.316
this is one down out of
three and it got a little hairy.

13:34.349 --> 13:35.951
Hopefully, the
other two go better,

13:35.984 --> 13:38.053
but, um, yeah, I'm just
gonna collect up my tools,

13:38.086 --> 13:39.988
try to get a good
dinner tonight, rest up,

13:40.022 --> 13:42.891
and tomorrow will
be another kinda
long challenging day.

13:48.764 --> 13:50.432
BRITTANY: Sometimes, I think
people think I'm a lot more

13:50.465 --> 13:54.503
tough than I am
because of where I live.

13:54.536 --> 13:57.506
But, I'm such a city girl.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.943
Adapt or die, right?

14:04.580 --> 14:06.114
Kaleb, is this the tree?

14:06.148 --> 14:08.350
KALEB: I think we
can make this work.

14:08.383 --> 14:09.985
So, guys, do you know
why we picked this tree?

14:10.018 --> 14:11.086
GILBERT: Why?
ELOVIE: Why?

14:11.119 --> 14:13.589
KALEB: Because it's a nice,
big, wide spruce tree.

14:13.622 --> 14:16.225
There's dead stuff
like this all around it.

14:16.258 --> 14:18.560
So, we'll be able to grab
stuff like this branch here to

14:18.594 --> 14:19.728
add to our fire.

14:19.761 --> 14:21.263
BRITTANY: Can you
guys help us with that?

14:21.296 --> 14:23.498
ELOVIE: No.
BRITTANY: Yeah.

14:23.532 --> 14:26.201
KALEB: Today, I wanna teach my
kids how to build a shelter,

14:26.235 --> 14:28.570
build a warming fire.

14:28.604 --> 14:31.373
I want to arm them with the
tools necessary to go out in

14:31.406 --> 14:32.841
the woods on their own.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.376
That way, if
they do wander off,

14:34.409 --> 14:36.378
they're able to take care of
themselves and not get into a

14:36.411 --> 14:38.513
hopeless situation.

14:38.547 --> 14:41.516
Here's some, Gil. Gilbert.

14:41.550 --> 14:43.752
Take these and put
'em in the pile.

14:44.286 --> 14:46.121
BRITTANY: So, Ellie, you wanna
know something interesting?

14:46.154 --> 14:47.422
ELOVIE: What?

14:47.456 --> 14:49.157
BRITTANY: Because
of where we live,

14:49.191 --> 14:51.760
we don't have a school
for you to go to, right?

14:51.793 --> 14:54.596
Well, this is something
that we can call school.

14:54.630 --> 14:56.932
We're out here
learning survival skills.

14:56.965 --> 15:01.136
So, it's called
the school of life.

15:03.338 --> 15:05.274
Look at all that!

15:05.307 --> 15:06.708
KALEB: Let's start gettin'
these green cottonwoods here

15:06.742 --> 15:10.112
and we'll kinda make a wall
from that tree around to here.

15:10.145 --> 15:11.313
BRITTANY: Okay.

15:11.346 --> 15:13.048
KALEB: And then we'll
build a fire about right here,

15:13.081 --> 15:15.317
and it'll kinda reflect
heat into the shelter.

15:15.350 --> 15:17.052
ELOVIE: I am tired!

15:17.085 --> 15:18.620
BRITTANY: That's okay.

15:18.654 --> 15:20.856
You can be tired
and still do it.

15:20.889 --> 15:23.792
This is an all-day
school session, kids.

15:23.825 --> 15:26.328
When the family and I
get to go out together,

15:26.361 --> 15:28.163
we're not only
creating memories,

15:28.196 --> 15:31.166
we're teaching our children
things that will hopefully

15:31.199 --> 15:33.302
carry them as they grow.

15:33.335 --> 15:36.471
And I think that's really
great that we can wrap up

15:36.505 --> 15:40.375
learning things
and family memories.

15:41.043 --> 15:43.345
KALEB: Now,
let's light a fire.

15:43.378 --> 15:46.181
And we just kinda nurse it
along until it's got a little

15:46.214 --> 15:48.283
more strength, then we start
putting a little bit bigger

15:48.317 --> 15:49.785
stuff on it.

15:49.818 --> 15:53.322
BRITTANY: I'm really
glad that we get to
learn this from daddy.

15:53.355 --> 15:56.591
That way, if, God forbid, you
two are ever separate from us,

15:56.625 --> 16:00.429
I know that you have a little
bit of an idea of how to be

16:00.462 --> 16:02.731
okay until we find you.

16:02.764 --> 16:04.766
I think that's really cool.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.768
Can you guys say,
"Thank you, daddy,
for teaching us?"

16:06.802 --> 16:09.404
BOTH: Thank you, dad,
for teaching us.

16:09.438 --> 16:11.673
KALEB: You betcha, guys.

16:17.879 --> 16:19.548
JESSI: It's just the
outdoors, right?

16:19.581 --> 16:21.383
Just living out in Alaska.

16:21.416 --> 16:23.118
It's just the Cosna.

16:23.151 --> 16:26.388
You're either gonna be
the hunted or you're
gonna be the hunter.

16:32.561 --> 16:34.129
CHRIS: There's just
nothing for animal prints.

16:34.162 --> 16:36.898
Kinda surprised.

16:37.666 --> 16:40.102
We're constantly battling
to keep our homestead safe.

16:40.135 --> 16:42.671
Always somethin'.
This time it's a bear.

16:46.375 --> 16:48.276
As we start entering into
this really thick brush,

16:48.310 --> 16:50.312
we have to really
keep our eyes out.

16:50.345 --> 16:53.382
He chased us off last
time back through this way,

16:53.415 --> 16:55.117
uh, so we're definitely gonna
be entering his territory and

16:55.150 --> 16:58.653
I'm just really afraid of
how dense the brush is,

16:58.687 --> 17:00.922
especially with a little
bit of snow on the branches.

17:00.956 --> 17:02.591
Chances are he
may be denned up.

17:02.624 --> 17:04.292
But I mean, it's
been really warm.

17:04.326 --> 17:06.361
I mean, it's almost
raining out today.

17:06.395 --> 17:09.131
Uh, so it's likely
he's still awake.

17:09.164 --> 17:11.600
JESSI: Looks like somebody's
been eating everything, huh?

17:11.633 --> 17:14.169
CHRIS: Yeah.
Let's keep after him.

17:14.202 --> 17:16.638
If he's out there, he
already knows we're here.

17:22.277 --> 17:24.613
A typical bear hunt, we're
sittin' up on a ridge and

17:24.646 --> 17:26.882
we're watching bears
come out on to a lake.

17:26.915 --> 17:28.884
We've got 300 to
500 yards distance.

17:28.917 --> 17:31.620
We feel safe, we're covert,
we're up in the woods,

17:31.653 --> 17:33.889
but this is different.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.724
We're on that bear's terrain.

17:35.757 --> 17:40.195
So if you look out, it is
super dense woods out there.

17:41.029 --> 17:42.998
He could be standing 100
yards out there watching me

17:43.031 --> 17:45.067
and I wouldn't see him.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.669
There's a lot of tall brush
around here and heavy woods.

17:47.702 --> 17:49.604
Once you get a
snowfall on top of it,

17:49.638 --> 17:51.339
it becomes harder
to see through.

17:51.373 --> 17:52.808
All the trees
start to bend over.

17:52.841 --> 17:54.943
Uh, about six feet
off the ground is, like,

17:54.976 --> 17:57.612
my blind spot, and that's
about how tall that bear is.

17:57.646 --> 17:59.081
He's gonna be hiding
underneath that cover of

17:59.114 --> 18:01.616
snow and branches and
everything that's bent over

18:01.650 --> 18:03.518
is perfectly hiding him.

18:03.552 --> 18:05.253
They'll just lay down like a
dog waitin' for you to come

18:05.287 --> 18:07.122
home, hidin' behind the door.

18:07.155 --> 18:08.790
These guys are
sneaky, they're quiet,

18:08.824 --> 18:11.460
and they know
what they're doing.

18:16.064 --> 18:18.834
I'm worried about this guy.

18:20.635 --> 18:23.572
JESSI: This, for me,
is putting me on edge.

18:23.605 --> 18:26.741
As we're walking through the
trees and it's just building

18:26.775 --> 18:29.077
up this anxiety
that's inside of me.

18:29.111 --> 18:32.781
This bear could literally be
watching us at any moment.

18:32.814 --> 18:35.250
I need to stay sharp, I
need to stay strong out here.

18:37.519 --> 18:38.987
CHRIS: Making it really tough
with the fresh snow and the

18:39.020 --> 18:41.456
rain, I can't see
any prints anywhere.

18:41.490 --> 18:44.359
I feel like I'm
chasing a ghost.

18:45.160 --> 18:46.962
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

18:59.558 --> 19:01.426
JESSI: Freaking
myself out or somethin'.

19:01.460 --> 19:02.594
You know what I mean?

19:02.627 --> 19:04.429
CHRIS: Do you see
something move?

19:04.463 --> 19:05.730
JESSI: This tree's cracking.

19:05.764 --> 19:08.366
CHRIS: Okay.
Whoo, that got me!

19:08.400 --> 19:11.036
JESSI: The wind is still
hitting the trees and these

19:11.069 --> 19:13.905
trees are huge and they're
rubbing together and they're

19:13.939 --> 19:16.074
making these cracking noises.

19:16.107 --> 19:17.943
And every cracking
noise, you know,

19:17.976 --> 19:21.179
could be this bear
stepping on a branch.

19:23.715 --> 19:25.717
CHRIS: Here's the river and
the riverbank's that way,

19:25.750 --> 19:27.986
and I can start
seeing it through here.

19:28.019 --> 19:30.655
There's a big ridge that goes
up and bears love to den up

19:30.689 --> 19:32.858
on those ridges.

19:32.891 --> 19:35.460
Let's keep moving.

19:36.695 --> 19:39.164
I'm on high alert here.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.436
MICHAEL: Think about how life
could be if you're not feeding

19:44.469 --> 19:47.439
all these expensive,
unsustainable fabricated

19:47.472 --> 19:49.140
ways of life.

19:49.174 --> 19:52.010
Think about how
nice that would be.

20:00.151 --> 20:02.320
All right.
Another load.

20:02.354 --> 20:06.625
So I've been building up
all of these dilapidated
building materials.

20:07.848 --> 20:14.287
And so I have about 200 yards
to go through the woods here.

20:13.131 --> 20:16.468
This is not enough snow to
get a good packed trail,

20:16.501 --> 20:19.671
but it's enough to make
things slippery and to
make things difficult.

20:19.704 --> 20:22.574
We made a transition
into early winter,

20:22.607 --> 20:25.443
and this happened a lot
quicker than last season.

20:25.477 --> 20:28.380
I thought maybe I would be
able to get these pieces down

20:28.413 --> 20:33.018
the hill on four-wheel drive,
but I don't wanna risk sliding

20:33.051 --> 20:37.289
sideways and T-boning my
truck into a solid birch tree.

20:37.322 --> 20:42.127
And so, I'm gonna use, uh, a
skid sled to start movin' all

20:42.160 --> 20:44.262
these house
pieces down the hill.

20:44.296 --> 20:47.299
And so I'm gonna build this
skid sled real quick so that

20:47.332 --> 20:51.937
I could skid all these
pieces 200 yards down
to my building site.

20:52.804 --> 20:56.508
The standard skid sled is
still a very useful device

20:56.541 --> 20:58.977
all over Alaska.

20:59.010 --> 21:01.413
And then I have this
26-year-old snow machine

21:01.446 --> 21:03.648
that's been
sittin' for a long time,

21:03.682 --> 21:07.352
not worth nothin',
runs like crap.

21:07.385 --> 21:09.354
I'm gonna tune that thing up.

21:09.387 --> 21:12.123
Whoo! That was a knot.

21:12.157 --> 21:15.226
And then I'll pull
this sled down the hill.

21:15.260 --> 21:18.363
Easier said than done.
But you know what?

21:18.396 --> 21:21.299
You gotta make do
with what you got.

21:22.033 --> 21:24.569
All right.

21:24.603 --> 21:27.806
Now, I got everything
set up on this skid sled.

21:27.839 --> 21:30.942
I'm gonna go
ahead and lash it.

21:30.976 --> 21:34.512
You know, I'm taking
cordage and lashing all
the joints together.

21:34.546 --> 21:38.583
Lashing is a very old fashion
way of building something to

21:38.617 --> 21:41.386
have flex, and
there's a reason for that.

21:41.419 --> 21:44.556
Flexibility in a
brittle cold environment,

21:44.589 --> 21:48.960
it will survive a lot better
than mechanical fasteners.

21:48.994 --> 21:50.762
If you ain't living with a
headlamp on your head all

21:50.795 --> 21:53.732
winter, it pays to
have some flood lights.

21:53.765 --> 21:56.501
But right now, this is
a pressing moment where

21:56.534 --> 21:59.804
I'm just so close to getting
this skid sled done,

21:59.838 --> 22:02.941
and it is my goal to
finish this on time.

22:02.974 --> 22:06.011
Look at that,
lightin' up the night.

22:06.578 --> 22:09.581
No building project is ever
as quick as you envision,

22:09.614 --> 22:11.416
but I gotta keep
pushin' forward,

22:11.449 --> 22:14.119
I gotta keep this
freight train on schedule.

22:14.152 --> 22:16.688
The temperature swings up here
in interior Alaska are crazy

22:16.721 --> 22:18.757
and it's a very
dangerous environment,

22:18.790 --> 22:22.193
so I'm gonna finish
out this sled strong
so that first light,

22:22.227 --> 22:25.063
I can hook this thing
up and be ready to go

22:25.096 --> 22:27.899
down that hill.

22:34.806 --> 22:36.808
ALEX: I came out here
with almost no planning.

22:36.841 --> 22:38.576
I knew that as long
as I was persistent,

22:38.610 --> 22:41.112
I could just kinda
get through with grit.

22:41.146 --> 22:43.915
If nature wants to kill
me, it'll just kill me.

22:57.529 --> 23:00.732
So this is the, this
is the biggest one.

23:01.332 --> 23:03.268
Today's a new day, uh,
it's an opportunity to,

23:03.301 --> 23:05.704
uh, do a little better
than I did yesterday.

23:05.737 --> 23:09.240
Uh, yesterday, the big
tree I fell got hung up.

23:09.274 --> 23:10.775
I don't want a
repeat of that 'cause,

23:10.809 --> 23:13.712
uh, not only is it dangerous,
it's also just really

23:13.745 --> 23:15.847
frustrating to
waste so much time.

23:15.880 --> 23:18.650
So today, I'm gonna, uh,
take a little time and,

23:18.683 --> 23:22.520
uh, make sure I got a clear,
kinda drop zone for my trees.

23:22.554 --> 23:25.490
It's not gonna get
hung up on other trees.

23:25.990 --> 23:27.826
I don't ever cut trees
like this because there's

23:27.859 --> 23:29.527
not really any reason to.

23:29.561 --> 23:30.929
It is dangerous,
it is sketchy,

23:30.962 --> 23:33.231
it's unpredictable.

23:33.264 --> 23:35.433
But the job's gotta get
done one way or another.

23:35.467 --> 23:37.302
This isn't something I can
say, "Ahh, forget it!"

23:37.335 --> 23:39.104
Well, then the tree's
gonna crush me.

23:39.137 --> 23:42.207
All right. Those are set,
they're really tight.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.509
I'm gonna go
start cuttin' on it.

23:48.913 --> 23:50.148
This tree, you know,
I can just tell,

23:50.181 --> 23:51.850
it don't like me.

23:51.883 --> 23:53.451
You're going down (bleep).

23:53.485 --> 23:57.155
Before you kill me,
I'm killing you.

23:58.022 --> 23:59.624
Yeah, I'm a competitive guy.

23:59.657 --> 24:01.226
If something is
going against me,

24:01.259 --> 24:02.494
it's you versus me.

24:02.527 --> 24:04.062
I don't care if you're
an inanimate object.

24:04.095 --> 24:05.830
I love the tree,
I respect the tree,

24:05.864 --> 24:09.134
but he's gotta come
down and he's making
it a pain in the ass.

24:09.167 --> 24:12.537
(cracking).

24:12.570 --> 24:13.772
Ah-ha!

24:13.805 --> 24:15.273
Better than I expected.

24:15.306 --> 24:16.908
Whoo!

24:16.941 --> 24:18.676
I got a little
brief victory here.

24:18.710 --> 24:21.746
I can pat myself on
the back, but now it's
time to do it all again.

24:21.780 --> 24:24.215
Uh, this time the stakes are
higher because my last tree is

24:24.249 --> 24:27.018
one that's leaning
directly over my actual cabin.

24:27.051 --> 24:29.454
If this one isn't done
perfectly then I stand to

24:29.487 --> 24:32.657
basically lose everything.

24:32.690 --> 24:34.192
Okay.

24:38.396 --> 24:41.933
(chopping).

24:41.966 --> 24:44.269
When I'm taking on a
big risk like this,

24:44.302 --> 24:46.938
I just kinda mentally
prepare myself for the worst,

24:46.971 --> 24:48.540
and then if the worst
case doesn't happen,

24:48.573 --> 24:50.074
then I'm happy.

24:50.108 --> 24:51.976
Oh, but, if you're
not comfortable with
the worst outcome,

24:52.010 --> 24:54.479
then you shouldn't take
the risk in the first place.

24:55.213 --> 24:57.215
I put a little too much
tension on it, I think.

24:57.248 --> 24:59.918
I need to give it
the finishing pull.

25:03.755 --> 25:05.757
There we go.

25:05.790 --> 25:07.091
Whoa.

25:14.616 --> 25:16.251
o.

25:17.118 --> 25:19.087
Whoa.

25:19.120 --> 25:22.390
Whoo!

25:22.423 --> 25:24.158
That went good.

25:24.792 --> 25:27.662
I got the three biggest
danger trees down now.

25:27.695 --> 25:30.198
And they all, it
all, it all went good.

25:30.231 --> 25:32.166
I kinda got a double
whammy with this one.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.103
I saved my cabin, and also,
I got pretty much all of

25:35.136 --> 25:37.205
next winter's firewood.

25:37.238 --> 25:38.873
Just right here
waiting for me.

25:38.907 --> 25:40.942
Now, when I'm sleeping,
when there's a wind storm,

25:40.975 --> 25:43.344
I don't have to sit there and
just keep my fingers crossed

25:43.378 --> 25:45.880
that tonight's not the
night that a tree falls on me.

25:45.914 --> 25:47.982
So, you know,
it's a moment to, uh,

25:48.016 --> 25:50.785
breathe a big sigh
of relief and now I can just

25:50.818 --> 25:53.821
get to work
rebuilding my outhouse.

25:59.727 --> 26:00.929
BRITTANY: You want
to live out here,

26:00.962 --> 26:04.032
you definitely have
to embrace the winter.

26:04.065 --> 26:07.802
Everyone has to learn
how to survive in the
atmosphere that they're in.

26:11.906 --> 26:12.874
All right.

26:12.907 --> 26:14.742
So kids, you ready to
learn something more?

26:14.776 --> 26:15.743
GILBERT: Yeah.

26:15.777 --> 26:17.812
BRITTANY: Do you see how
there's smoke going up?

26:17.845 --> 26:19.080
Yeah?

26:19.113 --> 26:22.317
So what you want if you're out
in the bush and trying to get

26:22.350 --> 26:25.520
someone's attention, you want
to create as much smoke as you

26:25.553 --> 26:29.023
can, because that is
going to save your life.

26:29.057 --> 26:31.059
ELOVIE: Like a...
KALEB: Yeah.

26:31.092 --> 26:33.394
BRITTANY: And then you see
how dad was just shaking it?

26:33.428 --> 26:35.196
That helps create
more smoke too.

26:35.229 --> 26:36.931
KALEB: Like flipping
an egg in a skillet.

26:36.965 --> 26:39.233
That's the move.

26:39.267 --> 26:40.835
You want to come flip the egg?

26:40.868 --> 26:42.337
GILBERT: Yeah!

26:42.370 --> 26:44.238
BRITTANY: What we really
want is a lot of smoke,

26:44.272 --> 26:46.341
that way people know that,

26:46.374 --> 26:48.176
"Hey, we need help!
We need help!"

26:48.209 --> 26:50.712
We have smoke. Okay?

26:50.745 --> 26:52.146
GILBERT: Okay.

26:52.180 --> 26:53.581
BRITTANY: Coming
from the city,

26:53.615 --> 26:55.383
I definitely have
a lot to learn.

26:55.416 --> 26:57.185
Kaleb grew up around a
lot of these things,

26:57.218 --> 27:00.121
so he intuitively knows
how to do many things.

27:00.154 --> 27:01.255
GILBERT: Whoa!

27:01.289 --> 27:02.657
KALEB: Now we got some smoke!

27:02.690 --> 27:04.492
BRITTANY: Or he was
taught at a young age,

27:04.525 --> 27:06.227
and I love that we get
to teach our children.

27:06.260 --> 27:09.530
And it's really awesome that
I'm learning these things.

27:10.865 --> 27:12.834
KALEB: If you guys, if you
guys ever get out in the woods

27:12.867 --> 27:15.803
on your own and you're lost,
build a great big fire with

27:15.837 --> 27:20.341
lots and lots of smoke, and
someone might fly over and see

27:20.375 --> 27:22.577
it and they'll be able to
tell someone where you're at,

27:22.610 --> 27:24.045
and they'll come
and rescue you.

27:24.078 --> 27:25.313
GILBERT: Oh.

27:25.346 --> 27:28.750
But then how, because they
wouldn't be able to land?

27:28.783 --> 27:31.019
KALEB: They'll tell
someone by the radio.

27:31.052 --> 27:33.454
BRITTANY: That's
something to consider is,

27:33.488 --> 27:36.257
like, you need to find the
places that are the best way

27:36.290 --> 27:39.894
to get rescued, too.

27:39.927 --> 27:44.399
Like, survival is number one,
but being found is number two.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.403
All right. Gilbert, what
did you learn today?

27:48.436 --> 27:53.041
GILBERT: To survive and...

27:53.074 --> 27:55.510
make shelter and a fire.

27:55.543 --> 27:59.914
BRITTANY: What did
you learn about how to
light or make smoke?

27:59.947 --> 28:01.683
How to make smoke?

28:01.716 --> 28:04.185
ELOVIE: Shake the fire.
BRITTANY: Shake the fire!

28:04.218 --> 28:06.721
ELOVIE: Shake it, shake it!
BRITTANY: Shake it, shake it!

28:06.754 --> 28:08.856
All righty, shall
we have some lunch?

28:08.890 --> 28:09.857
BOTH: Yeah!

28:09.891 --> 28:11.693
BRITTANY: Yeah!

28:14.228 --> 28:16.097
MICHAEL: This
living within my means,

28:16.130 --> 28:19.534
this developing a rural
landscape from scratch,

28:20.520 --> 28:25.725
there is a lot of gain
from this pain and
that is independence.

28:31.512 --> 28:32.847
All right.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.817
Now I'm just gonna
line this thing up and
do a little mini load.

28:37.585 --> 28:42.557
I'm gonna take probably a
half load right down there.

28:43.291 --> 28:46.060
Bumpy trail, barely a
trail, six inches of snow,

28:46.094 --> 28:47.662
200 yards down.

28:47.695 --> 28:49.063
And so, I gotta go slow.

28:49.097 --> 28:50.431
I gotta use a light load.

28:50.465 --> 28:52.233
But it looks clear enough.

28:52.266 --> 28:54.702
I think this is
gonna go really well.

28:55.470 --> 28:57.071
All right.

28:57.105 --> 28:59.107
Let's see what we're
working with here.

28:59.140 --> 29:02.210
First load down the trail.

29:04.378 --> 29:06.380
Once I get all the
pieces down there,

29:06.414 --> 29:09.317
life's gonna be a lot easier,

29:10.785 --> 29:13.721
'cause then I can
put together my home.

29:15.923 --> 29:17.492
All right.
Here we go!

29:17.525 --> 29:19.961
From sun up to sun down.

29:19.994 --> 29:22.964
I don't mess around.

29:22.997 --> 29:26.634
This is the plan today,
moving all this stuff down
to the building site.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.202
I don't have enough snow.

29:28.236 --> 29:32.039
I'm hopeful that these
first few runs are going well,

29:32.073 --> 29:35.276
but I'm, I'm a little
reluctant to be skidding stuff

29:35.309 --> 29:37.845
without enough snow.

29:37.879 --> 29:40.648
But I'm gonna try.

29:41.916 --> 29:44.886
Whoo! First load.

29:44.919 --> 29:48.055
Without issue.

29:55.163 --> 29:58.966
All right.
The next loads are only
gonna get bigger and crazier.

30:02.370 --> 30:04.205
All right.
Here I am on this run.

30:04.238 --> 30:07.408
This is the biggest piece yet.

30:20.288 --> 30:22.123
What the (bleep)?

30:22.156 --> 30:24.292
This skid has collapsed.

30:24.325 --> 30:26.694
Wanting to act a fool.

30:26.727 --> 30:29.096
Rushing a little too much.

30:29.130 --> 30:31.098
This sled (bleep) suck.

30:40.391 --> 30:41.926
MICHAEL:
Everything was going good.

30:41.959 --> 30:43.494
This was a great load.

30:43.528 --> 30:45.396
Sometimes when I
get to, to working,

30:45.429 --> 30:48.199
I get in that mode
and I forget stuff.

30:49.384 --> 30:54.889
Lashings loosen up, the
runner just caved on one side.

30:53.771 --> 30:57.008
I'll have to
support that some more.

30:57.508 --> 30:59.710
I'm gonna go ahead
and prop this up,

30:59.744 --> 31:02.613
get the weight off this side,

31:02.647 --> 31:07.618
and get that runner upright.

31:08.920 --> 31:11.622
And then, I'm gonna scab
another piece of wood that

31:11.656 --> 31:15.626
will prevent it
from moving that much.

31:16.027 --> 31:19.497
That ought to limit that.

31:19.530 --> 31:23.834
And so, I think that should be
the last piece of the puzzle

31:23.868 --> 31:28.773
before this free sled is
actually working well for me.

31:29.707 --> 31:31.642
All right.

31:31.676 --> 31:33.978
We'll see if that
will limit the flex.

31:34.011 --> 31:36.113
Thinking this might work.

31:36.147 --> 31:38.983
Life is a fine
blend of pessimism,

31:39.016 --> 31:41.586
optimism, and realism.

31:41.619 --> 31:45.356
And so, it's up to you how
you wanna blend your life.

31:45.389 --> 31:48.693
Just like new, but not really.

31:48.726 --> 31:53.164
For me, I like to be on
the most part, realistic.

31:53.998 --> 31:58.135
Optimistically, I would
say that this should
be the last repair.

31:58.169 --> 32:01.572
Realistically,
probably won't be.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.242
Pessimistically,
I'd like to say,

32:04.275 --> 32:06.711
"Screw this sled!"

32:06.744 --> 32:09.046
But you can't just
throw your hands up in
the air and walk away,

32:09.080 --> 32:12.717
'cause Alaska is never
gonna change in regards to

32:12.750 --> 32:15.286
how challenging the
environment is.

32:15.319 --> 32:17.922
You gotta keep your
cool, figure it out,

32:17.955 --> 32:21.259
and keep moving.

32:23.327 --> 32:26.797
All right!

32:26.831 --> 32:29.066
I got a good blend today.

32:29.100 --> 32:31.335
Little bit of optimism.

32:31.369 --> 32:35.506
Sometimes, when you feel
like life is so terrible,

32:35.539 --> 32:39.210
you just gotta remind yourself
how thankful for life you are.

32:39.243 --> 32:42.013
If you got a full belly,
you got warm toes and warm

32:42.046 --> 32:45.049
fingers, and your
body still works,

32:45.082 --> 32:48.452
be happy with what you have,
get through that problem,

32:48.486 --> 32:50.755
and keep trucking.

32:50.788 --> 32:52.757
Wow.

32:52.790 --> 32:54.792
Did that just happen?

32:54.825 --> 33:00.064
Did I just haul a
massive piece of floor
with no crazy conundrums?

33:00.097 --> 33:01.766
Did that really just happen?

33:01.799 --> 33:04.135
Dang.

33:04.168 --> 33:07.305
A little bit of adversity,
and now everything is just

33:07.338 --> 33:09.273
as smooth as silk.

33:09.307 --> 33:12.009
I'm feeling like
a million bucks!

33:12.043 --> 33:14.845
I'm gonna keep
hauling loads, man.

33:16.414 --> 33:20.117
Everything up here gets tested
by the Alaskan environment.

33:20.151 --> 33:24.121
I can't wait to get
all of this stuff up.

33:24.155 --> 33:25.890
Whoo!

33:25.923 --> 33:27.725
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

33:27.758 --> 33:31.095
In time, before the
real cold, cold spells,

33:31.128 --> 33:33.698
the 40 and 50
below stuff kicks in.

33:33.731 --> 33:37.401
It'll be a nice feeling to
jump into a new, cozy home.

33:37.435 --> 33:40.271
But there's still a lot of
work to be done before

33:40.304 --> 33:42.840
I get to that point.

33:47.345 --> 33:49.347
ALEX: For us as a
species to survive,

33:49.380 --> 33:51.182
we can't think that
we're above nature,

33:51.215 --> 33:52.683
because we're not.

33:52.717 --> 33:55.586
It's gonna come back to bite
us in the ass in a major way.

34:01.926 --> 34:03.728
This is a shooby magic.

34:03.761 --> 34:06.430
It's gonna be the
world's best outhouse.

34:06.464 --> 34:08.733
So today, I'm gonna kinda
finish out this whole little

34:08.766 --> 34:11.736
ordeal by
rebuilding my outhouse.

34:11.769 --> 34:13.537
So, this is my
front and back walls,

34:13.571 --> 34:15.606
kind of like the
frame of the house.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.541
And then those two
big plywood sheets,

34:17.575 --> 34:19.477
I'll kind of just
tack on to either side,

34:19.510 --> 34:21.045
which kind of gives it walls.

34:21.078 --> 34:23.214
And that's basically it.

34:23.247 --> 34:25.416
I could spend, you know, weeks
planning the perfect outhouse,

34:25.449 --> 34:27.017
and just make
something beautiful,

34:27.051 --> 34:29.286
but what's happening in
here is the same either way.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.255
It doesn't got to be pretty.

34:31.288 --> 34:33.724
We're gonna just do
this bush-bum style.

34:33.758 --> 34:36.761
Ah, it's not cooperating.

34:36.794 --> 34:37.828
I gotta brace it first.

34:37.862 --> 34:41.065
This is just an
exercise in frustration.

34:41.932 --> 34:44.068
If I had somebody
here to hold that,

34:44.101 --> 34:46.036
I wouldn't even need
to bother with this.

34:46.070 --> 34:48.339
A lot of times, I'll spend
as much time just basically

34:48.372 --> 34:51.876
making, like, braces and stuff
to hold something that if,

34:51.909 --> 34:54.512
uh, if I had another person,
they would just be able to

34:54.545 --> 34:56.213
hold it for me.

34:56.247 --> 34:57.982
So, it kind of like doubles
the amount of time you have to

34:58.015 --> 35:03.220
work, which is, uh, the reason
I spend half my time cussing.

35:03.254 --> 35:05.122
(grunting).

35:05.156 --> 35:06.824
(bleep).

35:06.857 --> 35:08.359
Piece of (bleep).

35:08.392 --> 35:10.961
Why can I not (bleep) do this?

35:12.430 --> 35:15.366
(bleep) stupid.

35:18.402 --> 35:19.470
Okay.

35:19.503 --> 35:21.472
So that's all braced up.

35:21.505 --> 35:24.041
Now, I can put my walls on.

35:31.582 --> 35:33.083
This is a good quitting point.

35:33.117 --> 35:34.418
It's about to be dark.

35:34.452 --> 35:36.454
I made good progress on this,
I just got one wall left,

35:36.487 --> 35:38.155
and then there's a couple
small little things I need to

35:38.189 --> 35:40.858
do, but I'll just finish
up those last little bits

35:40.891 --> 35:43.060
tomorrow morning.

35:49.400 --> 35:51.735
CHRIS: Out here, it's
survival of the fittest.

35:51.769 --> 35:55.005
You live day by day,
and you live by the gun.

36:04.715 --> 36:07.518
All right.
Head up to that burl.

36:09.587 --> 36:11.789
Now that looks like a den.

36:11.822 --> 36:15.125
JESSI: That looks like
a bear den to me, Chris.

36:15.159 --> 36:17.695
CHRIS: Let me see your rifle.
I wanna look at that.

36:23.868 --> 36:26.103
That sure looks like a
bear den to me, Jess.

36:26.136 --> 36:28.572
JESSI: It's a big old hole.

36:28.606 --> 36:32.276
CHRIS: Yeah, I can
see frost hanging.

36:32.309 --> 36:35.479
I'd like to know
if he's in there.

36:35.846 --> 36:38.883
He's denned up for the winter.

36:38.916 --> 36:41.952
And I'll have to get
closer to really know.

36:43.787 --> 36:47.091
What I'd like you to do is
go right out onto this knoll,

36:47.124 --> 36:48.759
and I want you
to just cover me.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.327
And I'm gonna go
up and around,

36:50.361 --> 36:52.863
and I'm gonna go
get a closer look.

36:52.897 --> 36:55.032
I'd really like to know that
he's denned up for the winter.

36:55.065 --> 36:57.167
JESSI: Okay.

36:57.201 --> 36:58.502
I'm gonna go straight.

36:58.536 --> 37:01.238
You, uh, you keep an eye
while I go up there, okay?

37:01.272 --> 37:02.840
CHRIS: Uh-huh.

37:02.873 --> 37:05.075
JESSI: All right.
Here we go.

37:05.109 --> 37:06.777
CHRIS: The first thing I ask
Jessi to do is go out onto the

37:06.810 --> 37:09.780
little island that
overlooks the bear den.

37:14.408 --> 37:18.845
Let me know, Jess, if
you see any movement, okay?

37:22.626 --> 37:25.996
What I want is her
having a top view as I
walk across this ravine.

37:26.030 --> 37:28.198
I don't want that
bear to sneak up on me.

37:28.232 --> 37:30.167
I don't want him
having the high ground.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.636
So, with Jessi pointing her
rifle directly into the den,

37:32.670 --> 37:35.940
I feel a lot more confident
about getting over there.

37:35.973 --> 37:38.342
Oh, I can see the
frost hanging down.

37:38.375 --> 37:40.511
I am fearful that there is
gonna be a bear in this den.

37:40.544 --> 37:42.313
It's really warm out today.

37:42.346 --> 37:44.748
Chances are if I start
stomping around and he's not

37:44.782 --> 37:47.751
sleeping, he's gonna come out.

37:48.852 --> 37:51.722
I'm gonna cross.

37:52.156 --> 37:54.625
As I head down and work my
way across this small ravine,

37:54.658 --> 37:56.994
my heart is thumping.

37:57.027 --> 37:58.596
I'm getting really
close to a bear.

37:58.629 --> 38:01.932
And not just any bear,
a big, aggressive bear.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.468
Oh, man.

38:04.501 --> 38:07.404
It's definitely a den.

38:07.438 --> 38:10.074
I'm gonna have to get closer.

38:11.342 --> 38:13.410
Oh, man.

38:13.444 --> 38:17.681
I'm gonna go back this way
and go up and around, okay?

38:25.389 --> 38:27.625
I don't want him to come out.

38:27.658 --> 38:31.128
I just wanna see
if he's in there.

38:33.397 --> 38:35.165
Now's the time to be quiet.

38:35.199 --> 38:38.068
This bear den is a hollow
hole underneath frozen ground.

38:38.102 --> 38:39.803
Every step I make is gonna
echo through the chamber of

38:39.837 --> 38:43.841
this bear, and I'm just trying
to be as quiet as I can.

38:45.209 --> 38:46.910
This is it.

38:46.944 --> 38:49.513
I might be face to face with
the biggest predator out here.

38:50.447 --> 38:53.884
There's a (bleep)
bear down here.

38:58.389 --> 39:01.392
There's something in there.

39:02.059 --> 39:05.429
The grass is moving.

39:09.096 --> 39:14.801
Oh, man. (bleep).

39:22.579 --> 39:23.947
Oh, man.

39:23.981 --> 39:25.449
I can hear
something shifting inside,

39:25.482 --> 39:27.518
weight being
moved and sat down.

39:27.551 --> 39:28.819
(bleep).

39:28.852 --> 39:32.189
There is a big bear in here.

39:35.192 --> 39:38.395
Don't wanna wake
you up, buddy.

39:40.564 --> 39:43.934
It's in there.

39:43.967 --> 39:46.937
I'm just gonna back away.

39:52.609 --> 39:53.811
Oh, man.

39:53.844 --> 39:56.480
There's definitely
a bear in that den.

39:56.513 --> 39:59.850
The best bet now is
to just back off, walk away.

39:59.883 --> 40:02.920
Let him hibernate
for the winter.

40:02.953 --> 40:05.589
I don't wanna fight
that bear this close.

40:08.058 --> 40:09.993
I don't see a big plug sitting
in here that says he's in for

40:10.027 --> 40:11.462
the winter.

40:11.495 --> 40:13.297
This bear could come
out at any moment.

40:13.330 --> 40:14.998
He's just getting comfortable.

40:15.032 --> 40:17.101
He's getting ready to
ride out this cold winter.

40:17.134 --> 40:20.037
But like me, he's
still hungry and he might
be coming out to hunt.

40:20.070 --> 40:22.372
I don't want to mess
with his den anymore.

40:22.406 --> 40:24.341
I'm hoping he just stays put.

40:24.374 --> 40:26.343
Just gonna back away.

40:26.376 --> 40:31.715
Phew. Man.
That was intense.

40:31.749 --> 40:33.417
JESSI: Come up here.

40:33.450 --> 40:35.619
CHRIS: It feels good to know
this bear is inside its den,

40:35.652 --> 40:36.987
but with warm
weather like this,

40:37.020 --> 40:38.655
he could come
out at any point.

40:38.689 --> 40:40.257
So until we start
getting really cold weather,

40:40.290 --> 40:42.926
I'm still gonna be
looking over my shoulder.

40:44.228 --> 40:45.496
JESSI: Wow.

40:45.529 --> 40:47.064
CHRIS: There's a
bear in that den.

40:47.097 --> 40:49.266
He's trying to get
comfortable to hibernate.

40:49.299 --> 40:51.001
Hopefully, he stays in there.

40:51.034 --> 40:52.436
JESSI: You didn't
see any tracks?

40:52.469 --> 40:53.804
CHRIS: I didn't
see any tracks,

40:53.837 --> 40:54.972
and I went up and around.

40:55.005 --> 40:56.540
There's no tracks at all.

40:56.573 --> 40:57.775
JESSI: If it
wasn't for that storm,

40:57.808 --> 40:59.376
I mean, who knows?

40:59.409 --> 41:00.744
He could have gone
in there yesterday;

41:00.778 --> 41:02.246
He could have gone
in there last week, right?

41:02.279 --> 41:03.881
CHRIS: Yeah.

41:03.914 --> 41:06.750
JESSI: Well, at least
he's not out here and not
tracking us through the woods.

41:06.784 --> 41:07.885
I guess.

41:07.918 --> 41:09.720
CHRIS: Yeah, no kidding.

41:09.753 --> 41:12.089
JESSI: I guess nothing left
but to head back home, right?

41:12.122 --> 41:14.091
CHRIS: Yeah, it's
gonna get dark soon, and...

41:14.124 --> 41:15.559
JESSI: I don't
wanna be out here.

41:15.592 --> 41:17.261
I don't care if he's
away for the winter.

41:17.294 --> 41:20.430
I do not wanna be caught in
these thick woods in the dark.

41:20.464 --> 41:22.866
CHRIS: No. Let's get moving.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.502
JESSI: Ready?
I'll follow you.

41:33.110 --> 41:34.578
MICHAEL: All right.

41:34.611 --> 41:37.581
The last of the
last, right here.

41:37.614 --> 41:39.216
Phew.

41:39.249 --> 41:43.620
Oh, I think I made a coffin,
I can lay in it now.

41:44.655 --> 41:49.426
Bury me! Ugh.

41:54.898 --> 41:57.434
Today was definitely a
bludgeoning of the mind,

41:57.467 --> 41:58.769
of the body.

41:58.802 --> 42:02.706
Fix the sled, move the sled.
Lift this, drop that.

42:02.739 --> 42:06.243
Holy smokes.
But you know what?

42:07.048 --> 42:12.253
You can't escape the
strains of living a
rural Alaskan lifestyle.

42:12.349 --> 42:15.519
Now all I gotta do is assemble
this thing just like a kid

42:15.552 --> 42:18.088
would assemble a Lego set.

42:18.121 --> 42:20.624
Looking forward
to the challenge.

42:28.298 --> 42:30.767
BRITTANY: All right.
Hand me a stick.

42:30.801 --> 42:32.703
Let's test out.

42:32.736 --> 42:34.137
Whoa!

42:34.171 --> 42:36.006
(Kaleb laughing).

42:36.039 --> 42:37.741
KALEB: Today, my
kids learned a lot.

42:37.774 --> 42:40.210
Their little minds
are like sponges.

42:40.244 --> 42:41.578
They soak stuff up.

42:41.612 --> 42:44.081
So, when they're young like
this is the best time to teach

42:44.114 --> 42:47.217
them how to
survive in the bush.

42:47.918 --> 42:50.821
Gilbert and Elovie are the
fourth generation of Rowlands

42:50.854 --> 42:52.856
to live here in the
McCarthy Valley.

42:52.890 --> 42:54.658
And they're not
the last generation.

42:54.691 --> 42:57.361
Someday, their
kids will be here, too.

43:02.733 --> 43:04.268
ALEX: I got the
walls, the floor,

43:04.301 --> 43:06.904
and then the finishing touch,
a little toilet paper holder.

43:06.937 --> 43:08.272
And that'll be it.

43:08.305 --> 43:10.240
I'll have this great outhouse.

43:10.274 --> 43:11.708
You ever just sit on
your toilet and think,

43:11.742 --> 43:13.644
"I got it made.
I'm a frickin' king."

43:13.677 --> 43:16.046
No, you don't think that
until you live in the bush.

43:16.079 --> 43:17.581
And then you think that.

43:17.614 --> 43:18.815
That's just part of
kind of bush living.

43:18.849 --> 43:20.250
It puts things in perspective.

43:20.284 --> 43:22.853
It makes you realize how
many thousands of years of

43:22.886 --> 43:26.023
technological progress
we're standing upon.

43:28.125 --> 43:29.960
Nice outhouse,
it's all complete.

43:29.993 --> 43:32.696
The only thing left
to do is test her out.

43:37.234 --> 43:39.503
CHRIS: Tell you right now,
I'd much rather hunt
than be hunted.

43:39.536 --> 43:40.871
That's a big change.

43:40.904 --> 43:43.373
I didn't like that feeling
of something stalking me.

43:43.407 --> 43:46.176
Having some lights on
the house isn't gonna
keep the bear away.

43:46.209 --> 43:47.644
But when you have a light
switch and you can light up

43:47.678 --> 43:49.579
your entire grounds
as far as you can see,

43:49.613 --> 43:50.881
you just feel better.

43:50.914 --> 43:53.283
It's just comforting.

43:56.453 --> 43:59.156
Time to try it out.

43:59.189 --> 44:00.457
All right.

44:00.490 --> 44:01.725
JESSI: Good job, love.

44:01.758 --> 44:03.994
CHRIS: Fear is like a weed, it
gets inside of you and it will

44:04.027 --> 44:07.564
grow and grow and grow,
and it's gonna push you
out of this lifestyle.

44:07.597 --> 44:10.233
You have to prepare for it.
