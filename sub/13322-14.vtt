00:00.625 --> 00:02.460
Brandon:
Previously, on The Fosters ...

00:02.502 --> 00:03.169
What the hell is going on
around here?

00:03.169 --> 00:05.505
You're getting high,
you're stealing Jesus' pills,

00:05.547 --> 00:07.590
and he cheated on the SATs.

00:07.632 --> 00:09.342
There are far too many secrets
going on around here,

00:09.384 --> 00:09.926
so the doors are coming off.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.846
You lied about Nick,
about the Adderall,

00:12.887 --> 00:15.515
and I don't think
that I'm ever gonna
be able to trust you.

00:15.557 --> 00:16.725
Watch out!

00:16.766 --> 00:17.350
(tires screeching)

00:17.350 --> 00:18.184
-Why is she in cuffs?
-She's under arrest.

00:18.226 --> 00:21.187
I know you killed
your grandmother,
and we're gonna prove it.

00:21.229 --> 00:21.855
You're crazy.

00:21.896 --> 00:22.856
Hey, what kind of job
are you doing as parents?

00:22.897 --> 00:26.818
This is the second time
that Callie's been in juvie
since she's been with you!

00:26.860 --> 00:29.738
So I'm going to send
Ms. Adams Foster to adult court.

00:29.779 --> 00:33.116
There are so many unknowns
about traumatic brain injuries.

00:33.158 --> 00:36.036
There can be significant ups,
and unpredictable downs.

00:39.205 --> 00:42.834
Come on, Jude, let's go!
Been in there forever.

00:44.252 --> 00:47.297
Seriously?
There are other people
who live here!

00:47.338 --> 00:49.674
-Mornin'.
-Ma, c-- can we please
get our doors back?

00:49.716 --> 00:52.093
-Uh, no.
-Come on-- Everyone
is using this bathroom

00:52.135 --> 00:54.554
for, like, everything,
especially Jude,
who's taking...

00:54.596 --> 00:56.848
really long showers these days,
if you know what I mean.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.475
Sounds like he's done.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.895
Callie:
I'm in here!

01:01.936 --> 01:02.520
I was waiting!

01:02.520 --> 01:05.857
Hey, so was I.
I'll just be a second, God!

01:05.899 --> 01:07.484
Guess you should've
taken your shower last night.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.319
Well, yeah, well,
Mariana was in there
last night, and--

01:09.360 --> 01:11.529
-Oh...
-and now I have to go
to school with dirty hair.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.363
(chuckling)

01:12.405 --> 01:15.575
-What?
-Oh, you used to fight us
so much about taking a bath,

01:15.617 --> 01:17.702
and now look at ya.
Is Mariana awake?

01:17.744 --> 01:20.288
Hey, come on, let's go.
Time for school.

01:20.330 --> 01:22.540
Hello, come on,
I know you're awake.

01:23.541 --> 01:24.667
I don't wanna go to school.

01:24.709 --> 01:26.628
-Oh, come on.
-Ever again.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.672
-Honey, listen...
-I wanna be home schooled.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.425
Okay, well, that
is not an option, Mariana.

01:32.467 --> 01:36.971
Just the thought of seeing Mat,
and-- and the whole school
knowing that we broke up again,

01:37.013 --> 01:38.348
it's completely humiliating.

01:38.389 --> 01:40.558
I hear ya.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.227
I just can't believe
we're not gonna be together.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.312
Well, I am sorry
about that, love,

01:44.354 --> 01:47.148
but that is no reason
to drop out of school.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.858
'Kay? You can talk about it
in therapy today.

01:48.900 --> 01:49.901
I don't wanna go to therapy.

01:49.943 --> 01:50.485
So you don't wanna
do anything?

01:50.527 --> 01:52.821
Come on, this is not open
for discussion.

01:52.862 --> 01:56.324
H-- He comes highly recommended.
My love, this is gonna give you

01:56.366 --> 01:59.661
a-- a productive place
to talk about all
of these feelings.

01:59.702 --> 02:00.328
Ugh.

02:00.328 --> 02:03.873
Okay, enough
with the melodrama.
Let's go.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.169
Brandon, why aren't you dressed?
You're gonna be late.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.130
C-- Can you talk to Mom, please?
We need our doors back.

02:10.170 --> 02:12.590
Brandon, please, not now.
I-- The last thing I need
is more stress.

02:12.632 --> 02:13.424
This is ridiculous!

02:13.424 --> 02:14.217
Hey, you know what?
How about you try
to figure out a way

02:14.259 --> 02:19.597
to be part of the solution
instead of the problem,
for once.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.349
Hey, did Jude leave yet?

02:21.391 --> 02:23.935
And you need to get started
on your college applications.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.855
And for God's sake,
finish your senior
project, please.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.148
I don't really know
what the point is,

02:28.189 --> 02:29.357
since I'm probably
going to jail.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.108
Honey, you're not going to jail.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.986
Oh, and don't they have, uh,
college classes in prison?

02:33.027 --> 02:35.280
Oh, I have an idea.
Why don't you take the SATS
for me?

02:35.321 --> 02:36.823
Wow... juvie's hardened you.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.575
All right you guys, enough.

02:38.616 --> 02:41.077
Enough. Yes, we have all
had our setbacks lately,

02:41.119 --> 02:43.830
but... on we soldier, right?

02:43.872 --> 02:45.582
Mariana doesn't wanna
go to school, but don't worry,

02:45.623 --> 02:47.333
I told her she's
going to school.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.378
(shower running)

02:50.420 --> 02:51.504
Mariana:
I'm in here!

02:51.546 --> 02:53.173
You showered last night!

02:53.214 --> 02:54.591
Gotta be faster, B.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.388
(thud)

03:00.430 --> 03:01.598
Callie:
Moms!

03:05.351 --> 03:07.228
What? Oh my God.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.355
What happened, honey,
what happened?

03:09.397 --> 03:10.398
What is it?

03:10.440 --> 03:11.482
What happened?

03:11.524 --> 03:13.693
I just-- I just-- I just...

03:13.735 --> 03:15.320
wanted to be upstairs

03:15.361 --> 03:16.571
with-- with--
with everyone.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.989
Okay, okay.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.200
Okay, baby.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.411
Take it easy, take it easy.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.665

So is everyone talking?

04:06.537 --> 04:08.164
About what?

04:08.206 --> 04:08.748
Me and Mat?

04:08.790 --> 04:12.126
I don't think anyone
even knows or cares.

04:14.045 --> 04:17.089
-How's Jesus?
-He fell down the stairs
this morning.

04:17.130 --> 04:18.716
Well, up, technically.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.051
I think he just really
wants to get back

04:20.093 --> 04:21.552
into his bedroom
and out of that dining room,

04:21.594 --> 04:22.720
you know?

04:22.762 --> 04:24.180
It can get pretty lonely
down there.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.557
So... what's going on with you?

04:26.599 --> 04:28.059
Um... I'm fine.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.228
I only ask because...

04:30.270 --> 04:31.771
well, the reason
that Mat dumped me...

04:31.813 --> 04:33.314
well, sort of...
the reason, anyway--

04:33.356 --> 04:35.191
Can-- Can we talk
about this later?

04:35.233 --> 04:37.610
Well, no, this is about you...
you'll see.

04:37.652 --> 04:39.988
So... Brandon saw you
buying a pregnancy test

04:40.029 --> 04:41.489
at the hospital.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.408
He thought that you
were buying it for me...

04:43.449 --> 04:44.033
long story.

04:44.033 --> 04:47.203
So Brandon asked Mat
if I could be pregnant.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.330
Which made Mat think
that I had sex with Nick.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.873
For the record, I did not.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.667
But... Mat broke up with me
because he doesn't know

04:52.709 --> 04:54.335
if he can believe me or not.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.586
Anyway...

04:55.628 --> 04:57.839
are you pregnant?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.966
Um... no.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.176
I'm... I'm-- I'm not.

05:02.218 --> 05:02.885
I-- I thought that I might be,

05:02.885 --> 05:06.347
but... the test was negative,
and I got my period.

05:07.765 --> 05:08.766
Thank God.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.685
I know, right?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.020
See you in class.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.148
Kyle:
You got arrested?

05:15.189 --> 05:18.318
I'm sorry.
I can't believe you did
all that for me.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.361
That's all right.
It's gonna be all right.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.448
Um, but the good news
is that we got a match

05:23.489 --> 05:25.992
from the DNA
on the murder weapon.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.077
The curb painter guy?

05:28.119 --> 05:31.539
Uh, no... um...
according to the report.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.417
it belongs to a male relative
of Martha's.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.879
And the only male relative
she had was her grandson, Troy.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.006
O-- Okay, so, can we
take that the police?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.759
Well, it wouldn't be admissible
because it wasn't court-ordered,

05:42.800 --> 05:45.386
and it could get Callie
in even more trouble.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.972
Right, but all we need to find
is a motive.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.017
If we can prove
that Troy had a reason
to kill his grandmother,

05:51.059 --> 05:54.520
then... maybe a judge
would force him to give
a DNA sample.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.773
Did you... know Troy,
did you ever see him?

05:56.814 --> 05:58.566
No... I don't think so.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.361
But I remember her saying
that her grandson

06:01.402 --> 06:03.321
only ever called
when he wanted money.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.489
Okay. That's something.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.574
That's good.

06:06.616 --> 06:10.161
Um... we have to go,
I have to meet up
with my lawyers.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.414
So... um, will this change
the JJC's mind, y-- you think

06:13.456 --> 06:15.124
this will make 'em
take my case?

06:16.084 --> 06:17.251
I hope so.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.172
Well... at least
they stopped me

06:21.214 --> 06:23.216
from getting moved
to Folsom early.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.176
And we're gonna
do everything we can
to make sure

06:25.218 --> 06:26.427
that that never happens.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.846
You got six weeks, then...

06:30.890 --> 06:33.726
Um... look, I-- I don't...
know if I said this already,

06:33.768 --> 06:35.520
but, thank you.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.689
I mean, what you guys
are doing for me is...

06:38.731 --> 06:40.233
you know what I mean.

06:41.526 --> 06:42.944
Good luck today.

06:47.031 --> 06:49.367
(jail door buzzing)

06:49.409 --> 06:52.662
Up... down...
you got it, you got it.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.997
Good, now side to side.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.624
Uh-huh. Good.
The sooner you get

06:56.666 --> 07:00.169
your balance back, the sooner
you'll get up those stairs.

07:00.211 --> 07:00.837
I hate you.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.881
(laughs)
Just wait 'til we add
the flash cards.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.676
Combining physical activity
with cognitive exercises

07:06.717 --> 07:09.846
actually helps the brain
re-wire itself.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.265
Okay, Jesus...
what's this say?

07:14.976 --> 07:15.768
(weights hitting floor)
I'm done.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.187
No, come on, not yet.
Five sets of flash cards,
here we go.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.522
-Come on.
-No.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.940
-Honey, you can do this--
-Shut up!

07:23.484 --> 07:25.445
Jesus.

07:25.486 --> 07:27.822
Okay, hey, let's just--
let's just take a little break.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.907
Louise?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.826
Let me get you a cup of coffee.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.578
Is it too early for vodka?

07:35.746 --> 07:37.373
Outbursts like that
are totally common

07:37.415 --> 07:40.543
in people
with TBIs, so...
try not to take it personally.

07:40.585 --> 07:44.505
Yeah, uh, our doctor
warned us. Just... sucks.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.009
How long is he gonna
be like this?

07:48.050 --> 07:50.303
It's hard to say.

07:50.344 --> 07:53.598
For some people with TBI,
the short fuse never goes away.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.984
If we can get everyone
involved in the accident
to sign a contract

08:05.026 --> 08:08.988
saying they want all charges
against Callie immediately
dropped...

08:09.030 --> 08:11.741
And that they have no intention
of pursuing her civilly...

08:11.782 --> 08:13.159
We take all that
to the judge.

08:13.201 --> 08:15.161
Now, the DA will balk,
they always do.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.996
But the judge will be inclined
to accept it,

08:17.038 --> 08:19.874
since his docket's so full,
and the jails are overcrowded.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.293
So the charges will just...
be dismissed?

08:22.335 --> 08:24.170
It'll be as if the accident
never happened.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.006
Okay, why would they agree
to this, the people involved
in the accident?

08:27.048 --> 08:27.924
Because we're gonna pay
their bills.

08:27.924 --> 08:32.511
Medical, auto repair,
any lost wages, as well
as a little something

08:32.553 --> 08:34.179
for pain and suffering.

08:34.222 --> 08:35.806
How much are we talkin' here?

08:35.847 --> 08:38.433
We're hoping to lock it down
around three hundred grand.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.145
Well, we don't have
anywhere near that amount
of money.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.397
Robert:
I do.

08:44.857 --> 08:45.566
No, Robert.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.277
It's a small price to pay
to keep Callie out of prison.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.655
But I didn't do anything wrong,
I didn't cause the accident.

08:50.696 --> 08:54.075
Wh-- Why are we trying
to settle or whatever?

08:55.201 --> 08:56.661
Because of this.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.621
What is that?

08:58.663 --> 09:00.289
That's Callie's file.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.837
Chip:
Look... this is a he-said,
she-said case.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.715
So it's gonna come down
to a matter of character.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.842
Who the jury believes.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.594
Okay, but I'm telling
the truth.

09:13.636 --> 09:17.890
We know. We believe you.
But it doesn't matter.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.850
What's going on trial
is your record.

09:19.892 --> 09:23.980
So much of what is in there
is-- is bias, and-- and false.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.148
Can't we fight that?

09:26.190 --> 09:27.567
We would lose.

09:28.234 --> 09:32.697
Okay... so, uh, we pay off
the people who were hit,
and then--

09:32.738 --> 09:34.448
And Troy Johnson.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.993
N-- Why does he get paid?

09:37.034 --> 09:39.161
No, no way.
The accident was his fault,

09:39.203 --> 09:41.080
not mine, I only took off
'cause I was afraid of him.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.583
The problem is...
other than your word,

09:43.624 --> 09:46.544
we have no way to prove
why you were so scared, Callie.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.634
Stef, talk to you alone
for a minute?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.886
Yeah. Uh, hey, Cal?

09:57.179 --> 09:58.973
Meet you at the car, all right?

10:01.475 --> 10:03.936
She'll come around,
I'll talk to her.

10:03.978 --> 10:09.275
(sigh)
Yeah, actually, it's um...
it's about Sophia.

10:09.317 --> 10:13.487
She told me
that there was this strange man
following her around Bayfest.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.907
Accused her of-- of watching
him, and then breaking
into his house.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.995
Wow, okay, did she say
what he looked like?

10:21.037 --> 10:23.998
Yeah, he was about my height,
uh... light hair, blue eyes,

10:24.040 --> 10:26.667
wore a green Army jacket.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.628
Sophia swears
that she never
saw him before,

10:28.669 --> 10:30.212
so I just figured
he was some kind of weirdo,

10:30.254 --> 10:31.422
and I forgot about it.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.050
Just now... it occurred to me,

10:34.091 --> 10:37.470
Sophia and Callie, they--
they look so much alike.

10:37.511 --> 10:40.765
I mean, do you think
that maybe he...
he got them confused?

10:42.475 --> 10:44.018
Uh... I don't know.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.938
Um... it's--
you know, a possibility,
I'll check into it.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.940
Okay, just... wanted
you to know.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.817
Yeah, yeah, I appreciate that.

10:51.859 --> 10:55.988
I-- Um-- appreciate
everything... you know?

10:56.030 --> 10:57.990
-Yeah.
-Okay.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.210
Did you break
into Doug Harvey's house?

11:13.381 --> 11:15.174
I am at the end of my rope
with you, Callie.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.677
If the DA finds out that you
broke into Doug Harvey's house,

11:17.718 --> 11:20.137
that's it!
That's it, okay?
You're not buying your way

11:20.179 --> 11:23.391
out of anything, you're gonna
go to prison, for years.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.559
Okay, but maybe
that's what you deserve.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.271
God, I...

11:31.399 --> 11:32.608
I didn't mean that.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.735
-I know.
-What--

11:34.777 --> 11:38.489
I know. But...
if I didn't steal
that toothbrush

11:38.531 --> 11:41.492
and get it tested,
then we wouldn't know
about Troy.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.536
And Troy is the real killer.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.663
Kyle even told me
that he used to ask
his grandmother

11:45.705 --> 11:47.665
for money all the time,
that could be his motive.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.166
Lots of kids
hit their grandparents up

11:49.208 --> 11:49.959
for money.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.753
And listen, Troy's DNA
could've ended up
on that weapon

11:52.795 --> 11:55.673
the same way that Kyle's did,
okay? Helping Martha out
in the garden.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.259
You have got to leave this
to the professionals!

11:58.300 --> 12:02.680
The professionals didn't
even test the other DNA,
they buried it!

12:02.722 --> 12:06.183
And what about Detective Gray?
Or Patrick Molloy? Who--
Is anyone making sure

12:06.225 --> 12:07.101
that he's not hurting
other kids?

12:07.143 --> 12:11.063
I am going to do everything
in my power to get Gray
and Molloy, okay?

12:11.105 --> 12:14.608
But for right now,
I need you to focus
on your problems.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.737
This is my problem,
if we can prove that Troy
killed his grandmother,

12:17.778 --> 12:19.822
then I won't go to jail!

12:19.864 --> 12:21.991
And Kyle
will get out of prison.

12:22.032 --> 12:26.746
We won't have to pay anyone
off... the only person
who will pay is Troy Johnson.

12:45.514 --> 12:46.432
This is hard.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.269
I know, honey, but Tomas said
that it will help you
with your tremor.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.738
Can I have some water?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.239
I can keep an eye on him.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.950
Yeah.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.335
-Hey...
-What?

13:14.376 --> 13:15.669
-What?
-Don't...

13:18.964 --> 13:21.342
Oh, wow, that's--
that's great.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.968
Yeah, I'm-- I'm done.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.137
No. One more time.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.932
-No.
-Just one more time, honey,
and you can take a break.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.391
I said no!

13:29.433 --> 13:30.768
Jesus!

13:33.938 --> 13:34.980
(sigh)

13:39.610 --> 13:41.529
Okay, right, right,
right, right...

13:48.702 --> 13:50.204
(sigh)

13:52.873 --> 13:54.834
(sigh)

13:54.875 --> 13:58.087
Hey, you know,
I, uh, I-- I got it.

13:58.128 --> 14:02.299
And... why don't you let me
take Jesus to therapy tomorrow?

14:02.341 --> 14:04.385
You could use the break.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.482
Okay... why am I doing this?

14:18.524 --> 14:23.153
Ah. Well, EMDR uses
rapid eye movement
to lessen our distress

14:23.195 --> 14:25.322
when recalling
traumatic experiences.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.283
Lets us talk
about our feelings.

14:27.324 --> 14:31.078
And it also helps us
reprogram our response
to the upsetting memories.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.081
Okay.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.584
Let's just... give it a try,
see how it feels, okay?

14:39.962 --> 14:41.171
Why don't we begin
with the moment

14:41.213 --> 14:42.840
you discovered Nick
in your room?

14:44.049 --> 14:45.718
You saw the gun.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.553
How did you feel?

14:47.595 --> 14:48.721
Scared.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.100
Anything else?

14:55.227 --> 14:57.313
Powerless, I guess.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.939
Okay.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.900
You ever felt that way before?

15:02.693 --> 15:03.903
Yeah, sure.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.821
Bunch of times.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.323
Like when?

15:08.532 --> 15:10.242
Like,
when the whole robotics team

15:10.284 --> 15:12.077
turned on me.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.121
Okay.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.456
Any others?

15:18.042 --> 15:21.170
When my mom got shot
and we thought
she was gonna die.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.463
Yeah.

15:23.839 --> 15:24.965
When was the very first time

15:25.007 --> 15:27.134
you can remember
feeling powerless?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.725
Jesus and I were babies.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.688
We were in our crib crying...

15:39.730 --> 15:42.316
calling out for our mom,
but she never came.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.859
How long did you wait?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.155
I don't know, it...

15:48.197 --> 15:50.282
could've been a day,
maybe longer.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.912
And how did you feel,
as that abandoned
little baby?

15:58.123 --> 15:59.291
Scared.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.085
And powerless.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.474
Oh, Troy, 301?

16:15.516 --> 16:19.687
(whistling)
That's not just bad credit,
that's no credit.

16:21.855 --> 16:23.232
(sigh)

16:42.751 --> 16:44.503
What the hell are you doing?

16:44.545 --> 16:46.797
It's okay. My therapist
gave me permission.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.841
Your therapist
gave you permission?

16:48.882 --> 16:50.676
Yes.
An important part
of my recovery

16:50.718 --> 16:52.469
is taking my power back.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.846
By disobeying your mother?

16:53.887 --> 16:56.974
Look... this isn't
about you, this is about me.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.018
And I feel powerless
having zero privacy,

16:59.059 --> 17:01.020
so I'm changing that.

17:01.061 --> 17:01.937
Also, he wants to talk
to all of us together,

17:01.979 --> 17:05.607
but... I told him
that wasn't gonna happen
since you guys are so busy.

17:05.648 --> 17:07.818
But he assured me
that since you guys
love me,

17:07.859 --> 17:09.819
you'll make time to come in.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.156
-When?
-Tomorrow, at three.

17:12.196 --> 17:13.531
Tomorrow. Hm.

17:13.574 --> 17:14.907
You know what?
Forget it. It's fine.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.703
No-- No, honey, we will--
we will make the time.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.204
Are you sure?

17:19.246 --> 17:19.913
Great.

17:19.954 --> 17:21.915
Well, if you have
any more questions
or concerns

17:21.957 --> 17:24.542
about my privacy,
we can discuss them then.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.794
Good night!

17:27.963 --> 17:29.757
Uh... are we in trouble?

17:29.798 --> 17:32.176
I think the point is,
Mariana is.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.096
Yeah, I get that.
(phone rings)

17:38.724 --> 17:39.475
Hello?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.643
Stef, it's Captain Roberts.
I just wanted you to know

17:41.685 --> 17:42.436
I got your message
the other day,

17:42.478 --> 17:44.897
and I'd like to find a time
for us to meet, if that's okay.

17:44.938 --> 17:45.522
Yes, uh...

17:45.564 --> 17:47.524
Why don't we get together
tomorrow morning

17:47.566 --> 17:48.692
at around 10 or so?

17:48.734 --> 17:50.486
Um... okay.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.988
-Will that work for you?
-Absolutely, I-- I will
see you tomorrow.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.490
I look forward to seeing
you, Stef.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.825
Okay, bye.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.828
-Who was that?
-Uh, Captain Roberts.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.331
She wants to see me
in her office tomorrow morning.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.458
You think they made a decision
about you becoming detective?

18:04.500 --> 18:09.171
Uh... maybe, but, um...
I did leave a message
for her a while ago.

18:09.213 --> 18:14.009
When we were at Bayfest,
telling... her that
there was something...

18:14.051 --> 18:14.968
I needed to take
to Internal Affairs.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.680
Stef, we talked about this.
We agreed that you weren't
going to do that.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.725
Okay, and I was talking
to Callie about the fact
that sometimes

18:21.767 --> 18:23.352
you have to do
what you gotta do,

18:23.393 --> 18:25.104
no matter how hard it is.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.314
No, you can't do this.
You can't lose your job.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.150
I-- I am already on leave.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.652
Monte has hired a replacement.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.569
What am I supposed to do, then?

18:32.611 --> 18:36.240
I-- I gave my word
to Callie that I would deal
with Gray and Molloy.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.951
What kind of message
is that gonna send to her
if I just-- if I just let it go?

18:38.992 --> 18:40.994
Oh, I don't know, Stef,
what kind of message
is it gonna send

18:41.036 --> 18:43.872
when we are on the streets
because we both lost our jobs?

18:43.914 --> 18:45.124
That's...

18:48.210 --> 18:51.922
I just-- I don't think
that I can walk this back
with Captain Roberts.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.383
Well, you better
figure out a way...

18:57.219 --> 18:59.179
Apparently,
I'm a total sociopath.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.431
-(laughs)
-Yeah, I'm, uh...

19:01.473 --> 19:04.810
defiant, paranoid,
prone to violent outbursts,

19:04.852 --> 19:06.895
with no respect
for personal property,

19:06.937 --> 19:09.231
authority,
or the rules of society.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.234
No wonder my lawyers
don't wanna go to trial.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.570
If you believe this,
I should be locked up forever.

19:15.070 --> 19:18.991
You took a baseball bat
to your foster father's car?

19:19.032 --> 19:21.994
Yeah, 'cause he was beating
the hell out of Jude.

19:22.035 --> 19:22.870
Well, why isn't
that in here?

19:22.870 --> 19:27.124
And why doesn't it say
that that same guy
ended up killing a kid?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.376
This is exactly what's wrong
with the justice system.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.254
All it says is the "what,"
and not the "why."

19:32.296 --> 19:35.924
It's this kind of thinking
that makes us lock people up
and throw away the key.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.346
They put me in solitary.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.681
In juvie?

19:45.267 --> 19:47.936
Oh, my God,
I'm... so sorry.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.523
Any chance you know anything
about construction?

19:51.565 --> 19:53.525
Not really, no.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.527
Why?

19:55.569 --> 19:59.239
All right... you got this, bro.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.867
I'm not... your bro.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.244
Actually you are,
or did you forget that, too?

20:04.286 --> 20:06.205
Hey, come on, Jesus,
stay focused.

20:06.246 --> 20:07.831
Come on, you got this,
let's go, you can do this.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.498
It's hard!

20:08.498 --> 20:10.459
I know, but you can do this,
come on, let's go.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.919
Go away, man.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.311
Woman's voice:
Nice, good job.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.647
(piano playing faintly)

20:43.700 --> 20:47.955
Um, okay, so,
we have to build the base
first, and then mount it

20:47.996 --> 20:49.289
on the skids.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.083
Great.

20:51.124 --> 20:52.626
What are skids?

20:52.668 --> 20:53.919
I have no idea.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.005
Hey!

20:57.047 --> 20:58.340
You guys need some help?

20:58.382 --> 20:59.675
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.093
Thought you had
basketball practice.

21:01.134 --> 21:01.677
Yeah.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.638
I did, and it's over,
and I missed you.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.764
Oh...

21:08.267 --> 21:10.227
Hey, man.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.478
Hey.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.229
So what's happening?

21:12.271 --> 21:16.942
Uh, Aaron was just helping me
finish my senior project.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.860
So what's it supposed
to be now?

21:18.902 --> 21:20.654
Uh, it's a cell.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.322
Solitary confinement?

21:22.364 --> 21:24.741
Kinda like the one
they... put me in
at juvie.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.413
-Wow.
-Yeah, it's cool, right?

21:29.454 --> 21:30.580
Yeah.

21:31.915 --> 21:35.669
So... a skid is basically
like a platform,

21:35.711 --> 21:37.337
it's what supports
the structure.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.922
I didn't know
you knew about construction.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.675
Yeah, well... you would've.
If you'd have asked me.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.314
Hi.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.149
Can I... help you?

21:57.190 --> 21:59.651
My brother is, uh,
a patient here,

21:59.693 --> 22:01.611
and, uh, I w--
I was just wondering,

22:01.653 --> 22:03.238
this class,
what is it, exactly?

22:03.280 --> 22:05.824
Music therapy.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.826
That-- That noise was therapy?

22:07.868 --> 22:11.413
That... noise can actually
rewire an injured brain.

22:11.455 --> 22:15.208
Well, maybe I should, uh,
have my brother check out
your class, then.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.711
He, uh... has a TBI,

22:17.753 --> 22:20.172
and he's getting
really frustrated
in physical therapy,

22:20.213 --> 22:21.715
-so...
-Ah, yeah.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.217
You know, music
works wonders

22:24.259 --> 22:26.845
when it comes
to improving movement.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.639
It shares the same circuit
as motor control, so...

22:29.681 --> 22:33.226
Wow. I'm-- I'm a musician
as well. I play piano.

22:33.268 --> 22:37.356
But I've just never heard of...
music being used that way.

22:37.397 --> 22:40.650
Um... are you free right now.
Could I, maybe get you
a cup of coffee?

22:40.692 --> 22:43.278
(exhaling)
Whoa there, Beethoven!

22:43.320 --> 22:45.447
I... have a boyfriend.

22:45.489 --> 22:50.660
Oh, I, um...
I'm not, like... looking
for a girlfriend, or...

22:50.702 --> 22:53.663
or anything.
I just wanted to ask you
some questions to see

22:53.705 --> 22:56.083
if I could help Jesus.
That's... my brother.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.667
Oh.

22:57.709 --> 22:58.168
Yeah.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.920
Well, um...
I'm busy right now,

22:59.961 --> 23:01.880
I-- I have to do
some homework,

23:01.922 --> 23:06.259
but, uh...
you're welcome to, uh,
sit on one of my classes.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.011
I'm here every day
at this time.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.640
I have to ask my supervisor,
but I'm... sure it'll be fine.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.934
Okay, yeah, maybe I, uh, will.

23:13.975 --> 23:16.269
I'm Brandon...

23:16.311 --> 23:17.854
by the way.

23:17.896 --> 23:18.939
Grace.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.486
Sit. So I got the message
that you left me.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.988
-Uh-huh.
-But then the whole thing
happened with your kids,

23:27.030 --> 23:28.281
and I thought
maybe it would be better

23:28.323 --> 23:29.825
if I hold off a beat
before we talked.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.284
I appreciate that.

23:32.619 --> 23:38.041
Um...
I called because,
as you know--

23:38.083 --> 23:43.296
Before you say anything,
I think you should know
that you made detective.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.548
Congratulations.

23:45.757 --> 23:46.591
Thank you.

23:46.633 --> 23:50.679
They wanna place you
in Human Trafficking...
which is quite an honor,

23:50.720 --> 23:52.264
for a newbie.

23:52.305 --> 23:54.391
And you could
do a lot of good
there, Foster.

23:55.851 --> 23:58.270
I don't know what it is
you're compelled to tell me,

23:58.311 --> 24:03.066
but hear me when I say this...
you are one of the good ones.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.777
And if this is anything
that could put your career
in jeopardy,

24:05.819 --> 24:09.739
please... think carefully
before you speak.

24:11.950 --> 24:15.579
Now... what is it...
you wanted to say to me?

24:21.877 --> 24:25.380
(siren)

24:35.974 --> 24:39.686
Detective Gray:
Congratulations, Detective.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.439
I haven't accepted
the job yet.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.150
Well, when you do,
you can thank me
for the good word

24:45.192 --> 24:45.859
I put in for you.

24:45.901 --> 24:46.860
Did you know Troy Johnson
was having money problems?

24:46.860 --> 24:52.032
And that Martha took him
out of her will just a few days
before she was killed?

24:52.073 --> 24:55.327
Did you ever
even consider him
a suspect?

24:55.368 --> 24:58.955
Okay. Here.

24:58.997 --> 25:02.834
This will give you access
to all the case files.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.836
Whatever you want.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.505
Really.

25:06.546 --> 25:10.717
'Cause whether you wanna
believe it or not...
I do my job.

25:10.759 --> 25:12.761
(chuckles)

25:19.309 --> 25:22.437
All right. Good.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.524
It's not bad.
It's pretty sturdy.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.192
All right, so what's next?

25:27.234 --> 25:29.945
All right, now I have
some wallpapering to do.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.572
You're gonna put the pages
from your file up in there?

25:33.698 --> 25:34.366
Why would you wanna do that?

25:34.366 --> 25:37.202
Why would you want everyone
to see what's in there?

25:37.244 --> 25:40.163
Well, I think the point
is to expose what's wrong
with the system.

25:40.205 --> 25:43.291
You know, show how
a life can be boiled down
to a bunch of words

25:43.333 --> 25:45.460
on paper
that aren't even true.

25:47.754 --> 25:50.840
Um... so...
I have a midterm tomorrow,

25:50.882 --> 25:52.217
that I should probably
be studying for...

25:52.259 --> 25:53.510
Mm.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.304
-so, I'm gonna go.
-Thank you.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.347
Yeah.

25:57.389 --> 25:58.557
And good luck.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.979
What is the matter?

26:04.020 --> 26:07.107
Well, for one, I think Aaron
should let you answer
for yourself.

26:08.358 --> 26:11.111
Okay, uh...
I don't... really think

26:11.152 --> 26:13.113
he was trying
to answer for me.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.990
But okay.

26:15.031 --> 26:16.783
He's right.

26:16.825 --> 26:19.828
Well, it's great to see
that the two of you
are so...

26:19.869 --> 26:22.330
-Are we seriously
doing this again?
-I'm no-- I'm not jealous.

26:22.372 --> 26:25.333
Okay, not romantically,
or not because he's trans,
I'm just...

26:25.375 --> 26:28.378
wondering why it is
that you asked him for help
and not me?

26:28.420 --> 26:29.921
Because he was here, AJ.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.506
Of course he was here.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.176
And how come I didn't know
you were in solitary?

26:35.218 --> 26:36.886
I wasn't gonna tell anyone.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.054
Why not?

26:38.096 --> 26:39.598
Would you?

26:45.312 --> 26:47.397
I'm just glad you're not
gonna end up like Ty.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.732
Okay?

26:50.191 --> 26:52.777
You're lucky
your birth father has money.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.863
He can make this all go away.

26:54.904 --> 26:57.782
W-- Uh... are you saying
I'm taking advantage

26:57.824 --> 26:59.659
of my rich white privilege?

26:59.701 --> 27:01.911
I didn't say you were
taking advantage
of anything.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.330
Don't put words
into my mouth, Callie.

27:03.371 --> 27:05.332
'Cause I'm not.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.167
I wanna go to trial,
take my chances.

27:07.208 --> 27:08.543
Well, that's just stupid.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.170
Ty didn't have a choice
about going to court.

27:10.211 --> 27:11.046
You do.

27:11.087 --> 27:14.966
-Play it smart.
-Yeah, I-- uh, I've gotta go,
I've got work to do.

27:16.051 --> 27:19.679
What--
What did I say wrong?

27:19.721 --> 27:21.514
You didn't say anything wrong.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.475
Everything you said was right.

27:32.609 --> 27:36.154
(playing "Row Row
Row Your Boat" on piano)

27:36.196 --> 27:37.530
There you go,
that's it, Jesus.

27:37.572 --> 27:39.658
That's great.
Emma, not so much.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.494
-(all laughing)
-But... okay.

27:44.371 --> 27:46.498
Uh, try it again, guys,
try it again.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.003
-It's great...
-Yeah.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.714
I, uh, I met
this music therapy student
at the rehab center

27:54.756 --> 27:56.841
that-- that works
with TBI patients,

27:56.883 --> 28:01.846
and she was telling me
how music can rewire the brain.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.848
Really?

28:03.890 --> 28:06.017
That's amazing.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.396
Emma:
You're so good.
(laughs)

28:09.437 --> 28:10.522
Jesus:
You're so bad.

28:10.563 --> 28:11.272
(Emma laughs)

28:11.314 --> 28:14.526
Okay, guys... let's do this
from the top, one more time.

28:14.567 --> 28:18.363
Let's go.
One, two, three, four...

28:18.405 --> 28:20.407
("Row Row Row Your Boat")

28:20.448 --> 28:24.202
That's good, that's good,
and Emma, just make sure
you keep your hands here...

28:27.372 --> 28:31.334
-That's good... there you go...
Just like that. Got it?
-(laughing) Yeah...

28:31.376 --> 28:33.503
All right, let's start over,
let's start over.
You're doin' good.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.629
You're doin' good.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.509
This looks serious.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.387
Hey, come join us.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.097
What are you talkin' about?

28:45.306 --> 28:47.851
You...
and your... situation.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.563
What's going on?

28:51.604 --> 28:53.648
Troy didn't kill
his grandmother.

28:53.690 --> 28:54.607
We have all kinds of proof
that he was at work

28:54.607 --> 29:01.114
at the time of the murder...
a stamped time card,
security camera footage.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.700
His alibi is, uh...
it's airtight.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.328
There's no way we can claim
that you had a legitimate
reason to be afraid of Troy.

29:07.370 --> 29:11.374
How do we know that Gray
didn't mess with the files?

29:11.416 --> 29:15.003
I saw the video...
Callie, I saw it.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.464
We want the lawyers
to settle, Callie.

29:17.505 --> 29:20.842
No. No, I want
to go to court,
I didn't do this!

29:20.884 --> 29:22.510
We know
that you didn't do it.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.680
But this is not
your decision to make anymore.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.474
We agreed when you wanted
to do the fitness hearing,

29:27.515 --> 29:31.269
and that backfired badly.
We're not gonna take
that chance again.

29:31.311 --> 29:32.937
It's not right.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.524
Things aren't always
right or fair in life.

29:37.108 --> 29:40.320
Sometimes, we--
we just-- we gotta do
what we gotta do,

29:40.361 --> 29:42.572
and this is--
this is what we're gonna do.

29:52.373 --> 29:55.168
Well, I think she does
have PTSD, which is
not surprising,

29:55.210 --> 29:56.961
given what happened to her
with Nick.

29:57.003 --> 29:59.339
Um, but I think it goes
deeper than that.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.382
All the way back
to early childhood.

30:01.424 --> 30:04.010
And, unfortunately,
some of those same feelings.

30:04.052 --> 30:07.096
feelings of fear
and powerlessness
are being re-experienced

30:07.138 --> 30:08.097
by her at home.

30:08.139 --> 30:13.853
Well-- I-- I mean--
does this have to do with
the-- the doors being taken off?

30:13.895 --> 30:15.480
That's one example, yes.

30:15.522 --> 30:18.107
That's one example, so...
in what other ways does--

30:18.149 --> 30:18.942
does she feel powerless
at home?

30:18.983 --> 30:21.945
'Cause honestly,
from my perspective,
she-- she exerts her will

30:21.986 --> 30:23.738
on all of us
pretty much all of the time.

30:23.780 --> 30:26.616
I'm glad you used those words,
"from my perspective,"

30:26.658 --> 30:28.493
because that's really
the issue here.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.245
Tell me what you see
right there.

30:30.286 --> 30:34.582
Um...I guess that's a "W."

30:34.624 --> 30:37.961
-Lena?
-Um... I see a three.

30:38.002 --> 30:39.838
How about you, Mariana?

30:39.879 --> 30:40.630
Obviously, it's an "M."

30:40.630 --> 30:45.009
Well, I see an "E."
My point is, that we can
never assume

30:45.051 --> 30:47.011
that our perspective
is the only perspective.

30:47.053 --> 30:48.930
Which is why communication
is so important.

30:48.972 --> 30:51.140
All right, well,.
communication
is not the problem

30:51.182 --> 30:54.435
in our family,
I don't think it is.
The secrets are,

30:54.477 --> 30:56.479
which is the failure
to communicate.

30:56.521 --> 31:00.608
Not to mention
deliberately withholding,
misbehaving, flat out lies...

31:00.650 --> 31:03.278
And that's why you took
all your kids' doors off.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.154
Yeah.

31:05.196 --> 31:08.908
I absolutely hear
your frustration, however,
uh, bedroom doors,

31:08.950 --> 31:11.411
aren't the reason that kids
shut their parents out.

31:11.452 --> 31:12.996
Lack of trust is.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.330
Trust that you're going
to hear them,

31:14.372 --> 31:16.207
that you're going to respect
their feelings

31:16.249 --> 31:18.376
without assigning
your own perceptions to them.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.961
Okay-- Do we do that?
When have we done that?

31:20.003 --> 31:22.005
We always encourage the kids
to talk to us,

31:22.046 --> 31:22.839
all the time,
about anything.

31:22.839 --> 31:26.009
But then you call me
melodramatic, and act like
my feelings

31:26.050 --> 31:28.928
aren't as important as...
Jesus' injury or...

31:28.970 --> 31:32.265
Brandon's drama or
Callie maybe going to prison.

31:34.017 --> 31:37.395
Okay, well... maybe
their problems are a lot bigger
than mine, but--

31:37.437 --> 31:41.149
No, honey, don't do that
to yourself. I mean,
Nick held a gun to your head.

31:41.190 --> 31:43.943
And that's the challenge,
isn't it? As parents?

31:43.985 --> 31:46.654
To treat every child
respectfully?

31:46.696 --> 31:48.489
And that's one way
we can earn their trust.

31:48.531 --> 31:51.242
And hopefully, then,
they'll share their secrets.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.546
(crying)

32:13.222 --> 32:18.978
Oh, I'm... sorry,
I thought it was Mariana.

32:19.020 --> 32:21.397
She's at therapy.

32:21.439 --> 32:22.941
Are you okay?

32:24.776 --> 32:27.320
Did Jesus yell at you?
You can't take that personally,

32:27.362 --> 32:29.072
okay, it's just 'cause
of his injury.

32:29.113 --> 32:29.614
It's like he has no filter.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.991
No, I-- I know,
he's never yelled at me,

32:32.033 --> 32:35.286
it's just...
there's something
that I need to tell him,

32:35.328 --> 32:37.413
and I'm not sure
that I should.

32:38.706 --> 32:41.751
Is it something
you can... tell me?

32:44.087 --> 32:45.964
I think you already know.

of life to dust ♪

32:53.262 --> 32:59.102

33:01.187 --> 33:03.356

33:03.398 --> 33:05.817
How far along are you?

33:05.858 --> 33:07.360
A few weeks.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.571
I don't know what happened.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.824
I mean, I'm on the pill.

33:12.865 --> 33:15.118
C-- Can you talk
to your parents?

33:19.789 --> 33:21.416
What are you gonna do?

33:26.337 --> 33:29.257
I don't wanna be
a 16-year-old with a baby.

33:33.469 --> 33:37.306
Is it horrible
if I don't tell Jesus?

33:37.348 --> 33:43.021
I just think, you know,
with... his condition,

33:43.062 --> 33:46.482
I'm just afraid
that's it's gonna
be too much for him.

33:48.943 --> 33:53.656
I-- I think it'd be...
a lot for Jesus to handle,

33:53.698 --> 33:56.576
even without...
the brain injury.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.667
What if you talked to my moms?

34:04.709 --> 34:07.253
I can't tell your moms
and not Jesus.

34:10.422 --> 34:10.922
Does Mariana know?

34:10.965 --> 34:15.969
No.
And please...
don't tell her.

34:16.012 --> 34:17.179
Okay.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.639
You know how she is
with secrets.

34:18.681 --> 34:21.100
Ones that aren't
hers, anyway.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.478
Well, I'm... here.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.563
If you need anything.

34:25.605 --> 34:28.065
Even if it's just to talk.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.317
That's sweet.

34:29.358 --> 34:30.860
Thank you.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.360
Yeah.

34:45.248 --> 34:47.168
I'm just gonna...
clean up a little.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.503
Yeah.

34:55.802 --> 35:02.433
And, uh, apparently,
he's got, like,
an airtight alibi.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.686
Uh-huh.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.482
Okay, so...

35:09.524 --> 35:13.444
if it wasn't Troy Johnson,
and it wasn't Doug Harvey...

35:14.278 --> 35:22.036
Oh, I'm gonna keep looking,
but I, uh... really don't know
what else to do.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.291
Okay.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.252
Thanks for tryin'.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.797
-Really sorry.
-Yeah, no, I know.

35:34.048 --> 35:35.258
So, um...

35:35.299 --> 35:36.634
what happened
with your lawyers?

35:38.010 --> 35:42.306
Um... it looks like
they got a deal.

35:44.517 --> 35:47.478
My birth dad's gonna
pay off the victims.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.272
And then it all goes away.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.275
Good for you.

35:54.485 --> 35:55.653
-You okay?
-Yeah.

35:55.695 --> 35:57.655
No, why wouldn't I be?

35:57.697 --> 35:59.490
I mean, I shouldn't have
let you get my hopes up,

35:59.532 --> 36:01.200
but hey, that's
on me, right?

36:03.870 --> 36:05.997
-I gotta go.
-I'm really sorry, Kyle.

36:06.038 --> 36:08.124
I know you are.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.001
(door buzzing)

36:19.218 --> 36:21.179
You got a ton
of cards from both
the volleyball teams...

36:21.220 --> 36:24.223
(laughs)

36:24.265 --> 36:26.058
Check out this one
from Laurel.

36:26.100 --> 36:29.228
Y-- Y-- You have too much
makeup on.

36:29.270 --> 36:30.646
God, Jesus.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.939
-W-- W-- Well, I'm tired.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.858
You sh-- should go.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.419
So how was your meeting
with Captain Roberts?

36:53.461 --> 36:55.087
You haven't said.

36:55.796 --> 36:59.592
Um... well, I asked her
to give me 24 hours
to think about it.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.177
Uh-huh.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.764
And, uh... what--
what are you thinking?

37:06.182 --> 37:08.017
(sigh)

37:08.059 --> 37:09.310
I am...

37:09.352 --> 37:10.478
(sigh)

37:10.519 --> 37:13.064
I think that...

37:13.105 --> 37:15.816
think I'm gonna
take the promotion.

37:15.858 --> 37:17.526
You are?

37:19.153 --> 37:19.904
Yeah, I was thinkin'...

37:19.904 --> 37:24.659
after talking with Callie...
about her deal and everything...

37:26.494 --> 37:29.622
just realized
that that's probably what...
you've been trying to say

37:29.664 --> 37:31.582
all along.
That sometimes you
just gotta do

37:31.624 --> 37:33.876
what you gotta do, right?

37:33.918 --> 37:35.294
I know this isn't easy
for you.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.087
No, that's all right,
I'm fine.

37:36.128 --> 37:39.215
Not gonna give up
on Gray or Molloy
and the whole thing,

37:39.257 --> 37:41.801
I'm just gonna--
just gonna do it
from the inside.

37:54.063 --> 37:58.609
So I talked to Emma.
Everything's cool.
She's not pregnant.

37:58.651 --> 38:00.653
Uh, thanks for tellin' me.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.698
(tapping noise)

38:21.382 --> 38:24.176
Hey. Um...

38:24.218 --> 38:26.345
So I-- I've been doing
some thinking.

38:26.387 --> 38:30.808
It's-- You know, and
um... I-- I don't think
that-- that doors

38:30.850 --> 38:34.312
are really the problem,
here. Um...

38:34.353 --> 38:37.857
secrets are definitely...
an issue, um,

38:37.898 --> 38:40.526
and... trust.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.152
Stef and Lena:
Trust.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.238
Yes, which we are...
working on developing.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.825
Yes. We are.
But no more secrets.

38:47.867 --> 38:49.368
Deal?

38:49.410 --> 38:51.495
-Deal.
-Yes.

38:51.537 --> 38:56.125
Okay, well... doors
are at the bottom of the stairs.
