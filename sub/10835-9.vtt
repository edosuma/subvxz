00:01.710 --> 00:02.628
Previously on:

00:02.753 --> 00:04.505
We have a son together.

00:04.630 --> 00:06.715
I want to hire a private
investigator to find him.

00:06.841 --> 00:08.592
If we're gonna be together...
Wait.

00:08.717 --> 00:09.677
You want to be with me?

00:09.802 --> 00:12.053
You're kind of an amazing
kisser.

00:12.179 --> 00:13.388
I'm a cop, you dumb-ass!

00:15.390 --> 00:16.433
I want back
on the lacrosse team,

00:16.558 --> 00:17.601
Mr. Matthews.

00:17.726 --> 00:18.769
I'm gonna have to ask you

00:18.894 --> 00:20.604
to take a paid leave of absence.

00:20.729 --> 00:21.730
This is my job, Harry.

00:21.856 --> 00:22.606
What are the students
gonna think?

00:22.731 --> 00:23.732
Jason broke up with me.

00:23.858 --> 00:25.359
My boyfriend from
back home.

00:25.484 --> 00:27.528
I don't think we can be friends
if you're with Ethan.

00:27.653 --> 00:28.696
I don't want to keep us a secret
anymore,

00:28.821 --> 00:30.071
Ethan. It's wrong

00:30.197 --> 00:31.573
to lie to Naomi

00:31.699 --> 00:33.492
over and over again.

00:33.617 --> 00:37.329
♪ ♪

00:45.629 --> 00:46.797
Check it out.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.573
(laughing):
Oh!

01:13.615 --> 01:15.868
Guys, guys,

01:15.993 --> 01:17.703
I heard they met
over the summer.

01:17.828 --> 01:19.162
Yeah, she's hot.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.248
I would definitely hit that.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.624
Her? What about him?

01:22.750 --> 01:24.125
He's actually cute,
in a...

01:24.251 --> 01:26.127
just-walked-off-a-catalogue
kind of way.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.589
They know?

01:28.714 --> 01:30.173
How do they
all know?

01:30.298 --> 01:31.550
Didn't you get the text blast
from George?

01:31.675 --> 01:32.843
George?

01:32.968 --> 01:34.511
I blocked his number
in eighth grade.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.513
Look at this.

01:40.017 --> 01:42.477
GEORGE:
What's up, everybody?

01:42.603 --> 01:43.520
MIKE:
Dude,

01:43.645 --> 01:45.773
that's nuts.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.274
When did this happen?

01:47.399 --> 01:48.650
After Silver's party.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.193
How much did you see?

01:50.318 --> 01:51.779
I want details.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.488
You dorks can't handle
the details.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.616
Oh, my God, George,
you are so pathetic.

01:55.741 --> 01:56.700
Why don't you go back to rehab?

01:56.825 --> 01:58.452
(bell rings, guys laugh)

01:58.577 --> 01:59.870
HARRY:
All right,

01:59.995 --> 02:01.496
people.

02:01.622 --> 02:02.539
Let's settle.

02:02.664 --> 02:05.626
Everybody take
their seats.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.461
So, Mr. Matthews has taken a...

02:07.586 --> 02:08.628
Student's virginity?

02:08.753 --> 02:10.380
(class laughs)

02:10.505 --> 02:12.299
...leave of absence.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.634
Till we find

02:13.759 --> 02:14.718
a suitable substitute,

02:14.843 --> 02:16.470
I am your new teacher.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.513
I understand
we are working

02:18.639 --> 02:20.307
on Madame Bovary.

02:20.432 --> 02:23.435
Anybody want to tell me
where we are?

02:23.560 --> 02:26.354
Anybody?

02:27.606 --> 02:30.233
Has she tried
to kill herself yet?

02:30.358 --> 02:31.568
Oh, my God,
are you serious?
What?!

02:31.693 --> 02:32.820
Are you serious?

02:32.945 --> 02:33.695
Oh, wonderful.
What?
Are you serious?!

02:33.821 --> 02:35.238
Thank you!
Really?

02:35.363 --> 02:36.239
(door opens)

02:38.533 --> 02:39.868
Um, when did this become

02:39.994 --> 02:41.495
the new principal's office?

02:41.620 --> 02:42.788
Annie, thank you for joining us.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.081
You want to...

02:44.205 --> 02:45.666
take your seat,
so we can get started.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.503
Annie.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.046
Yeah?

02:51.170 --> 02:53.423
You and me have to chat
after school.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.883
Okay.

02:55.009 --> 02:56.677
Okay.
HARRY: Okay, then,

02:56.802 --> 02:58.512
Madame, uh, Bovary.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.305
All right, it looks like
we are on part three.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.518
Kel!

03:04.643 --> 03:06.520
Hey!
I thought you were
coming back tomorrow.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.563
Uh, I took
an earlier flight.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.024
How are you?
Good.

03:10.149 --> 03:11.984
Aren't you supposed
to be in class?

03:12.109 --> 03:13.694
I have last period
study hall.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.529
And you're studying...?

03:15.654 --> 03:17.531
The... the hallway
architecture.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.074
Thought it'd be
a great art piece.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.534
You know, the
labyrinthine nature

03:20.659 --> 03:21.785
of the high school
experience.
Mm.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.038
So? How was it?

03:24.163 --> 03:25.789
How's Dylan?
Here, hold this
for me.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.916
Well, Dylan is Dylan.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.250
You know, nothing's changed.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.419
Same cheekbones,
same sideburns,

03:31.545 --> 03:33.421
same perfectly
messy hairdo.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.840
Same commitment issues.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.591
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.885
How you doing?

03:38.010 --> 03:39.636
Actually,
really good.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.304
I'm okay with him

03:41.429 --> 03:43.557
being there and me being here.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.476
Just gonna leave myself open
to all possibilities, you know?

03:46.601 --> 03:49.563
Look at you with your advanced
self-understanding.

03:49.688 --> 03:50.564
I'm impressed.

03:50.689 --> 03:51.982
Don't be.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.109
I'm still a work in progress.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.986
Hey, I saw that Harry
was teaching Ryan's class.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.238
Is he out sick
or something?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.449
Yeah. Um, you missed some stuff
when you were gone.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.830
Mr. Matthews, what do you
say about the allegations?

04:06.955 --> 04:08.623
No comment.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.085
Sir, I'd just like to hear
your side of the story, sir.

04:11.210 --> 04:14.046
Navid, I respect your
perseverance, okay? I really do,

04:14.171 --> 04:16.548
but I said no comment,
and I meant it.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.259
Now go back to class
before I break your camera.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.803
I'm sure that's not the best way
to rehabilitate your image, sir.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.847
Navid, you want
to give me a break?

04:28.810 --> 04:29.686
Turn that thing off.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.438
Ryan...

04:31.563 --> 04:32.898
it isn't true, is it?

04:33.023 --> 04:35.609
It's complicated.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.612
No, it either is true
or it isn't.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.614
The guy I knew
before I left

04:40.739 --> 04:41.615
wouldn't do something like this.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.158
I just want you
to tell me the truth.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.785
I don't want to
believe the rumors.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.120
Why are you just running away
like this?

04:46.245 --> 04:48.038
I don't know what else
I can say.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.998
Sorry.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.673
So Dixon tells me you were
rockin' the karaoke at
your birthday party.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.050
I am so gonna
make him sing.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.635
Cool. Whatever.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.763
Yo, what's your deal?

05:04.888 --> 05:06.389
Nothing. Nothing.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.391
I'm just... I'm supposed
to meet Naomi, so...

05:08.516 --> 05:10.018
Chill.

05:10.144 --> 05:12.479
She doesn't know anything
about you and Ethan.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.189
You know?
How do you know?

05:14.314 --> 05:17.776
I saw you guys
at my party.
Oh.

05:17.901 --> 05:20.988
Naomi was going to walk in
on you and the jock strap,
but I distracted her.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.572
You're welcome, by the way.

05:22.697 --> 05:25.075
Wait, wait, wait, how do you
know that she didn't see?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.995
Because you're
still alive.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.288
You got to tell her soon.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.956
I mean if she finds out
from some random,

05:31.081 --> 05:32.415
it ain't gonna be pretty.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.334
Yeah. No, and I will.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.554
Hey.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.764
Hey.

05:47.889 --> 05:49.975
Um, Naomi, I...

05:50.100 --> 05:51.643
I'm a mess.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.727
I'm sorry.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.313
My parents...

05:54.437 --> 05:56.564
My mom filed
the divorce papers today.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.859
It's official--
I come from a broken home.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.402
Um, I'm so sorry.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.197
My parents throw in the towel,

06:03.322 --> 06:05.115
my relationship
with Ethan is over.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.701
I swear to God, if I get
another piece of bad news,

06:07.826 --> 06:09.036
I'm going to lose it.

06:09.161 --> 06:11.746
I'm going to really lose it.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.874
Um, I...

06:13.999 --> 06:17.878
Is there anything that
I can do at all?

06:18.003 --> 06:22.090
I could use the support
of my friends right now.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.971
Hey, you guys feel like hitting
up Robertson this afternoon?

06:28.096 --> 06:29.973
Well, I actually have to go blog

06:30.098 --> 06:31.808
about Professor Pervert,
you know, but...

06:31.933 --> 06:32.851
maybe some
other time?

06:32.976 --> 06:34.477
Later.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.854
How about you, Annie?

06:35.979 --> 06:37.147
Get our hair done,

06:37.272 --> 06:38.857
followed by some retail therapy?

06:38.982 --> 06:41.568
Um... sure, okay.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.153
Thank you.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.946
You really are a good friend.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.206
Hey, girly.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.874
Poker game at Meaghan's
house tonight.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.000
Are you in?

06:57.125 --> 06:58.585
Oh, sounds like fun.

06:58.710 --> 07:03.798
I wish I could, but I've
got my own games to play.

07:12.891 --> 07:17.854
♪ Is your mind
made for forgiveness? ♪

07:17.979 --> 07:19.480
Oh, that's cute

07:19.606 --> 07:21.441
in a Hannah Montana
on acid kind of way.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.779
So 16, huh?

07:25.904 --> 07:27.114
God, you've had
an intense year.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.242
ANNIE: Oh, it's been
a seriously crazy ride.

07:30.367 --> 07:31.993
New world, new school,
new friends...

07:32.119 --> 07:34.204
No boyfriend.
Yeah.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.164
I have to talk
to you about...

07:36.290 --> 07:37.207
That's a really
hard thing.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.625
Trust me, I know.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.043
I mean, since I
broke up with Ethan,

07:40.168 --> 07:41.878
I've been so lonely.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.714
What were you saying?

07:46.341 --> 07:48.218
I really don't like this dress.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.137
So, did you
break up with Jason

07:50.262 --> 07:52.806
before you left
Wizard of Oz land?

07:52.931 --> 07:54.849
ANNIE:
No, after I got here.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.852
Oh! Were you
the dumper or the dumpee?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.646
It was mutual.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.815
I mean, you can't
fight geography, right?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.358
That's too bad.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.277
Sounds like you guys
didn't really get a chance

08:05.402 --> 08:06.736
to see what would
have happened.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.280
I mean, maybe you'd
still be together

08:08.405 --> 08:10.157
if you hadn't
moved out here.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.326
Maybe. I don't know,
part of me felt like

08:12.451 --> 08:14.161
the breakup wasn't
real, you know?

08:14.286 --> 08:15.412
When things end
because of distance

08:15.536 --> 08:18.332
and not because of some
big relationship problem,

08:18.457 --> 08:20.083
it's kind of hard
to get closure.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.002
It would be great if
you could get closure

08:22.127 --> 08:23.086
and maybe see him again.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.712
Yeah, I guess.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.589
Wow.

08:26.714 --> 08:27.924
That's the dress.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.259
That's the dress
you should wear

08:29.384 --> 08:31.219
to the birthday
you'll never forget.

09:02.376 --> 09:04.002
Oh.
Guess who?

09:04.127 --> 09:06.129
Soft hands...
(chuckles)

09:06.254 --> 09:07.797
velvet voice...

09:07.922 --> 09:09.257
Megan Fox?

09:09.383 --> 09:11.176
Oh, my God!

09:11.301 --> 09:15.013
So... I've been thinking.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.139
About?

09:16.264 --> 09:18.350
About you and me,

09:18.475 --> 09:20.477
and the fact that
we are an "us" now.

09:20.601 --> 09:24.022
"Us"? That is my new
favorite word.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.607
We should do
something together.

09:26.733 --> 09:27.859
Like boyfriend-girlfriend stuff.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.236
What'd you
have in mind?

09:29.361 --> 09:31.863
Like lunch? Maybe a movie?

09:31.988 --> 09:34.157
I was thinking maybe something
a little bit more private.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.659
Yeah?
Well, uh...

09:36.784 --> 09:37.952
That's... that's really
not going to work.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.371
Why not?

09:39.496 --> 09:41.081
I have a lot
of footage to edit,

09:41.206 --> 09:42.374
and, uh, it's about
Mr. Matthews.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.833
It's, it's a really,
really big story.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.835
Oh, well, then I'll help you.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.628
That way we can be
hanging out together.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.089
Well, the only thing is, um...

09:49.214 --> 09:51.091
I can't have anybody else around
when I'm doing this.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.633
I kind of need to focus.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.845
Oh. Um...

09:55.970 --> 09:58.265
Okay, so I should just go, then?

09:58.390 --> 10:00.183
I'll call you later, right?

10:00.308 --> 10:02.143
Okay, yeah.
Thanks.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.104
Have fun.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.613
(sighs)

10:22.163 --> 10:24.165
"Matthews dips
in the kiddie pool"?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.375
Nice.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.877
I think it's my
best blog yet.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.505
And I love it when my
readers quote me back to me.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.215
You're just biased
against Matthews

10:32.340 --> 10:33.925
'cause he dated your sister.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.260
Well, yeah.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.844
It's like, what if
Ethan rebounded

10:36.970 --> 10:39.097
with some 'tween
from junior high?

10:39.222 --> 10:40.932
What do I care
who Ethan dates?

10:41.057 --> 10:41.849
It's not like he's with...

10:41.975 --> 10:43.310
Oh!

10:43.435 --> 10:44.852
(stammering)

10:44.978 --> 10:46.271
Ethan's with Annie?!

10:46.396 --> 10:47.981
Yes, but Dixon, I'm
the only one that knows.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.232
You cannot tell her
that you know

10:49.357 --> 10:50.942
or she'll think that
I told you, you know?

10:51.067 --> 10:52.693
And besides, they
haven't told Naomi yet,

10:52.819 --> 10:54.946
and if she hears
from somebody else...

10:55.071 --> 10:56.323
Hey, guys.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.199
Uh...

10:58.325 --> 10:59.618
Hey... um...
Hey!

10:59.742 --> 11:01.202
NAOMI:
Hey, Ethan,
so I was thinking...

11:01.328 --> 11:03.622
Uh, yeah.
NAOMI:
I don't know

11:03.746 --> 11:05.165
what you're getting
Annie for her birthday,

11:05.290 --> 11:06.416
but let's make sure

11:06.541 --> 11:08.001
she has an amazing
day, okay?

11:08.126 --> 11:09.294
I don't want to
give her a chance

11:09.419 --> 11:10.253
to miss Jason.
Uh, why would she?

11:10.378 --> 11:11.921
They're broken up.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.007
Yeah, but it sounds like
Jason's a really great guy,

11:14.132 --> 11:15.925
and they were really close,
kind of like you and I, so...

11:16.050 --> 11:18.052
Yeah, she seems
to be doing okay.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.013
Yeah, that's what I
thought until yesterday.

11:20.138 --> 11:21.764
What happened yesterday?

11:21.889 --> 11:22.849
We were shopping,

11:22.974 --> 11:25.644
and she could not stop
talking about Jason.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.312
I guess because the breakup
was long-distance,

11:27.437 --> 11:28.104
they just didn't
get closure.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.481
I don't know.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.149
I just don't want
her to feel alone

11:31.274 --> 11:32.400
on her 16th birthday,

11:32.526 --> 11:33.943
so let's make it
extra special, yeah?

11:34.068 --> 11:35.694
Cool.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.573
KELLY:
Yeah, you gave me the facts

11:38.697 --> 11:40.408
this morning, but did you
really have to fire him?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.410
I had no choice.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.412
Okay, did he
admit anything?

11:44.538 --> 11:46.122
It doesn't matter
what he said.

11:46.247 --> 11:47.332
How could it
not matter?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.791
It's his reputation
on the line.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.751
Kelly, allegations
were made.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.004
As principal, I had
to act on them.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.423
Okay...

11:55.549 --> 11:56.966
You're telling me

11:57.091 --> 11:59.010
that you believe that
Ryan slept with a student?

11:59.135 --> 12:01.304
I can't get into this
right now, Kelly.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.097
You have to trust me.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.265
(knocking)

12:05.433 --> 12:07.185
Uh, is this a bad time?

12:07.310 --> 12:08.520
I can come back later.

12:08.645 --> 12:11.064
No-- Kimberly,
I was just... leaving.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.193
Hi, Kimberly,
nice to meet you.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.028
Please sit down.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.823
Apparently, I'm
not allowed back

12:20.948 --> 12:22.867
into any more classes
until you sign this.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.286
Uh, yes, I wanted
to talk to you.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.372
Please sit down.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.501
If this is about
Mr. Matthews, I'm fine.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.461
Everything's fine.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.129
An aura of fineness
surrounds me.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.048
I'm glad to hear that.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.883
But, given the situation,

12:39.008 --> 12:40.843
I have trouble believing
that you're really okay.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.637
That's your problem, not mine.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.225
Are you angry at Mr. Matthews?

12:47.350 --> 12:48.643
Did he give you
a bad grade,

12:48.767 --> 12:50.937
maybe fail you
on some test?
No.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.022
Were you in a relationship
with him?

12:53.147 --> 12:54.482
Why are you asking me?

12:54.608 --> 12:55.900
I had nothing to do with this.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.360
Maybe you expressed
some feelings

12:57.485 --> 12:58.612
that he didn't return.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.533
Sounds like you're speaking
from your own experience.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.410
I mean, it would
be understandable.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.953
Everybody in your class

13:07.078 --> 13:08.329
loves him.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.664
He's young, dynamic,
not unattractive.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.832
Okay, I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.627
Can I go?

13:13.752 --> 13:15.503
If I'm late for Mr. Hunt's
class one more time, I'll be

13:15.629 --> 13:16.671
in detention for life.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.174
Come back if you want
to talk some more.

13:26.013 --> 13:28.015
Hello.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.935
Mom?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.853
DEBBIE:
Yoo-hoo, Annie!

13:35.440 --> 13:37.984
Boy, do we have a
surprise for you.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.569
Hey, guys.

13:39.694 --> 13:41.321
Annie, you will never guess
who's here.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.876
Jason.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.003
Hi, Annie.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.129
Hey.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.590
You could crush mint
on those abs.

14:00.715 --> 14:01.924
Happy birthday.

14:09.599 --> 14:11.559
Jason... in California.

14:11.685 --> 14:14.562
Right here
in our pool.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.315
Um, what are you doing here?

14:17.440 --> 14:19.526
I was hoping to
meet Lauren Conrad.

14:19.651 --> 14:20.610
Are these the right Hills?

14:20.735 --> 14:23.029
I would hug you,
but I wouldn't

14:23.154 --> 14:24.405
want to get you all wet.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.199
I wouldn't mind.
Tabitha.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.326
Surprise!

14:28.451 --> 14:30.203
What a surprise
it is.

14:30.328 --> 14:31.412
(chuckling)

14:31.538 --> 14:33.206
NAOMI:
Do you like

14:33.331 --> 14:34.248
your birthday present?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.333
He's from you?

14:35.458 --> 14:36.584
You're from her?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.127
No, I'm from Kansas,

14:38.252 --> 14:40.672
but Naomi paid
for the shipping labels.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.257
NAOMI:
Your sweet 16 birthday
is the most important day

14:43.383 --> 14:46.427
of your life, second only
to your wedding day, of course.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.262
And no girl should spend
that day without a man

14:48.388 --> 14:49.514
by her side.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.307
Yeah, but...
I-I told her

14:51.432 --> 14:53.476
that we weren't together,
but when she called,

14:53.601 --> 14:55.102
I just couldn't resist

14:55.228 --> 14:57.564
a chance to be with you
on your big day.
Well, it's

14:57.689 --> 14:59.982
very good to see you.
NAOMI:
All right, well,
I'm gonna get going.

15:00.107 --> 15:00.941
I know you guys
must have

15:01.067 --> 15:03.486
a ton to catch up on
before dinner.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.405
Um... dinner?

15:05.530 --> 15:07.240
Yeah.
I figured you'd want Jason

15:07.365 --> 15:08.825
to meet all of your friends,
you know,

15:08.949 --> 15:10.117
before the big day
and everything.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.327
You and Silver are in, right?

15:11.452 --> 15:13.538
I have to call Ethan.
I think that's about it.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.749
I'll take care of everything.
Don't you worry about a thing.

15:15.874 --> 15:19.502
Yay!
You are so lucky
to have made such
great friends here.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.171
Yeah. Um... So lucky.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.153
Adrianna. Uh... Hi.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.155
Hello, half of Navid's face.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.324
Is the other
half home?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.325
Uh... it's not a good time.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.827
Well, then when is?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.328
I've called you
a couple of times.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.538
I've texted you.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.206
Tried to hook
up at school.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.875
You've gone all
Woodward and Bernstein

15:58.999 --> 16:00.334
'cause of this
whole Matthews story.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.836
Can we talk about
this later, please?
No, we can't.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.172
You've been acting
really weird lately.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.173
Wait.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.635
Is... Is there
someone there?

16:10.428 --> 16:13.473
Yeah, uh...

16:13.598 --> 16:15.141
my baby sister Iman.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.434
Adrianna, uh...

16:16.559 --> 16:19.353
Iman, this is Adrianna.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.315
Hi, sweetie.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.566
MANOUCHER:
Navid.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.318
Is this the young lady
you told us about?

16:25.443 --> 16:27.278
MANOUCHER:
Welcome, Adrianna.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.656
We've heard wonderful things
about you.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.784
Come on in.
Please, please.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.957
(speaking Farsi)
Dad, no Farsi, okay?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.167
(Manoucher scoffs)
She's pretty, Navid.

16:41.292 --> 16:42.418
Way too pretty for you.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.336
Please don't
embarrass me.

16:43.461 --> 16:44.545
Keep your
voice down, okay?

16:44.671 --> 16:48.174
Adrianna, it's so wonderful
to meet you!

16:49.717 --> 16:51.594
Come in, come in.
Will you join us for dinner?

16:51.719 --> 16:52.846
Oh, Mom,

16:52.971 --> 16:54.430
I think
Adrianna already has plans.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.723
I wouldn't
want to impose.

16:55.849 --> 16:56.808
MANOUCHER:
Oh, nonsense.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.309
You have to meet
Atoosa's family.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.727
This is Shah-Lah
and Masood.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.061
Nice to meet you.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.605
My cousin Alex,

17:02.730 --> 17:04.064
my beautiful daughter

17:04.190 --> 17:05.525
Shar-Joon.
Hello.

17:05.650 --> 17:06.651
Hi. I'm Adrianna.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.068
Anoosh, his cousin.
Hi.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.195
I'm Adrianna.
Oh, just shoot me now.

17:10.320 --> 17:11.739
My brother-in-law Iraj
and his wife Roza.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.622
(phone rings)
Hey.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.457
You hanging in there?

17:21.582 --> 17:24.585
Oh, you know,
just, uh... walking Roxy.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.128
Nobody else wants
to be around me right now, so...

17:27.253 --> 17:29.549
I'd be there if I could.
Roxy, come here.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.426
But I guess I screwed that up
for both of us for a while.

17:32.552 --> 17:35.596
I really didn't think it was
going to turn out like this.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.725
I mean, I didn't, uh...
I didn't think.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.476
Maybe I deserve it.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.477
No, you don't.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.812
In a moment of extreme

17:42.937 --> 17:45.732
masochism, I decided
to read Silver's blog.

17:45.857 --> 17:51.153
You want to know the worst part,
aside from the grammar? (sighs)

17:51.278 --> 17:54.114
These kids...
they think I'm a sleazeball.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.366
They really do.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.701
You know the truth.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.536
That's what matters.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.955
I don't know how you do it.
How you spend your life

18:01.080 --> 18:02.248
letting people think
you're something you're not?

18:02.373 --> 18:05.334
Look, Ryan, I know
you've risked a lot for me.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.336
I swear to you, I'm going
to close this case as fast

18:07.461 --> 18:08.796
as I can.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.464
Then everything
will be back to normal.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.509
I'll be around.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.852
ADRIANNA:
Do you guys always
eat dinner like this?

18:22.977 --> 18:25.521
MANOUCHER:
Um... No. Not
usually this small.

18:25.646 --> 18:26.814
Can I tempt you

18:26.940 --> 18:28.315
with some
more khoresht?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.234
Dad, please.
She's had enough.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.403
No, thanks. I couldn't
possibly eat any more.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.571
I'm stuffed.
But you're

18:33.696 --> 18:35.656
so small! You need to put
some meat on your bones!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.324
Thank you.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.618
So, Navid,

18:38.743 --> 18:41.662
why didn't you tell me
you play the drums?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.497
Or the doumbek? Right?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.792
Oh, and he sings, too.

18:45.917 --> 18:46.876
What?
Oh, yes.

18:47.001 --> 18:47.877
Really?
Uh-huh. When he was

18:48.002 --> 18:48.878
little, he'd sing

18:49.003 --> 18:50.588
all day long.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.465
Please tell me
you have pictures.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.300
Better. We have video.

18:54.425 --> 18:55.802
You wouldn't want
to see them because

18:55.927 --> 18:58.429
they're poorly edited,
and you'd be wasting
your time.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.139
ATOOSA: Honey, he's right.
What are we thinking,

19:00.264 --> 19:03.476
talking about movies in front
of such a talented actress?

19:03.601 --> 19:05.269
We should be asking

19:05.394 --> 19:06.896
you for details of your exciting

19:07.021 --> 19:08.564
childhood.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.818
More importantly, Adrianna,

19:11.943 --> 19:13.778
how are you doing since leaving

19:13.903 --> 19:15.780
rehab?

19:15.905 --> 19:17.615
Mom.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.743
Um... it's fine.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.453
ATOOSA: I know that
must have been

19:22.578 --> 19:23.913
very difficult for you.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.624
ADRIANNA:
Uh... I'm great.

19:26.749 --> 19:27.750
I'm fine. Really.

19:31.587 --> 19:32.546
Thank you.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.090
Mom-Mom,

19:34.214 --> 19:35.633
do you happen
to have any dessert?

19:35.758 --> 19:36.634
Maybe something
to tempt Ade with?

19:36.759 --> 19:38.302
Of course, of course. Lydia?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.262
Bring the
desserts, please.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.389
(whispering):
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.734
ANNIE:
I will have an iced tea

19:53.860 --> 19:56.821
and the Japanese pear salad
with tiger prawns...

19:56.946 --> 19:58.405
And dressing on the side.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.449
Always.

20:00.574 --> 20:01.450
WAITRESS:
Absolutely.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.327
Those little details.

20:03.452 --> 20:04.745
You never seem
to forget, do you?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.956
I still remember
the way Ethan takes his coffee.

20:07.081 --> 20:07.874
You guys dated?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.416
Yeah. For a long time.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.877
We managed to stay friends
like you and Annie.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.962
Of course I stayed friends
with Annie.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.338
I mean, it's not just any girl

20:14.463 --> 20:16.298
whose idea of having a good time
is sneaking

20:16.423 --> 20:17.925
into a Jayhawks game.

20:18.051 --> 20:18.968
Hey, just that once.
I thought

20:19.093 --> 20:20.511
Security was going
to throw us out

20:20.636 --> 20:22.388
on our asses,
but she managed

20:22.513 --> 20:24.057
to sweet-talk the guard
into letting us stay

20:24.182 --> 20:25.474
by saying that
I was a foreign exchange

20:25.599 --> 20:27.476
student that was leaving
in the morning.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.478
True story.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.814
Seems like the silliest moments
between couples

20:31.939 --> 20:34.734
are the ones
that linger the longest.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.528
So, Jason, is...

20:37.653 --> 20:38.571
is this your first time

20:38.696 --> 20:40.531
to California?
Yes. But, hopefully,

20:40.656 --> 20:42.700
not the last.
I'm actually thinking
about going to UCLA.

20:42.825 --> 20:44.368
SILVER:
Oh! Wow!

20:44.493 --> 20:46.871
Then you would be
in L.A.

20:46.996 --> 20:47.872
Yeah. I'm going
to check out

20:47.997 --> 20:49.373
the campus while I'm here.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.416
Just like we talked about.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.710
That was a long time ago.

20:52.835 --> 20:53.794
Don't you have
two more years

20:53.920 --> 20:55.337
before college?
What's the rush?

20:55.462 --> 20:56.839
I thought I told you.
I'm a senior.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.841
I need to decide soon.

20:58.966 --> 21:02.428
Oh...
Yeah, UCLA is almost impossible
to get into, though, dude.

21:02.553 --> 21:03.804
I mean, you have some

21:03.930 --> 21:05.431
backup schools lined up?

21:05.556 --> 21:08.434
Jason is top of the class,
all-state football.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.645
UCLA is his...

21:11.771 --> 21:13.940
backup school.

21:14.065 --> 21:16.025
You're smart,
handsome and athletic.

21:16.150 --> 21:17.651
Distance wouldn't
be enough

21:17.777 --> 21:18.652
for me to let go of this one.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.780
I'm parched.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.532
I'm just going to go check
on that iced tea.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.037
So, more details.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.538
How long have you known Annie?

21:29.663 --> 21:30.831
Since grade school.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.833
We lived right around
the block from each other.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.044
It seems like our lives
always seem to cross.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.754
That is so sweet!

21:36.879 --> 21:38.756
I got to go

21:38.881 --> 21:40.800
to the bathroom.
Excuse me, please.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.806
So, uh, anything
new back home?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.269
I know.
I'm sorry.

21:51.393 --> 21:54.188
Naomi planned this whole dinner
before I knew anything about it.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.190
I thought you weren't even
in contact with Jason anymore.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.608
I haven't been
since we broke up.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.526
Did you guys actually break up
or just take a break?

21:59.652 --> 22:02.155
We broke up.
Cross my heart. I was there.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.781
Then why
is he considering colleges

22:03.906 --> 22:04.991
based on where you live?

22:05.116 --> 22:08.077
Look, we started dating
in junior high.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.745
Jason probably
just assumed

22:09.870 --> 22:11.205
that we'd always be together.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.624
And maybe because of the fact
that we broke up on the phone,

22:13.749 --> 22:15.168
he didn't get
enough closure.

22:15.293 --> 22:18.171
Yeah, so I've head.
Did you get enough closure?

22:18.296 --> 22:22.049
Ethan, I want to be with you,
nobody else.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.759
Then I think you should
tell him about us.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.511
I don't want to hurt him.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.305
And he's only here
for a couple of days

22:27.429 --> 22:29.307
and then he's gone.
Why make him feel bad?

22:29.431 --> 22:30.933
'Cause I want him
to know that we're together.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.768
And I wanted Naomi
to know the same thing,

22:32.893 --> 22:33.936
but you didn't want
to upset her.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.896
How is that different?

22:36.022 --> 22:37.731
Hey, is everything okay?
Yeah.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.733
Great.

22:39.859 --> 22:42.111
Good, well,
your iced tea has arrived,

22:42.236 --> 22:44.947
so you don't have to really wait
here for it anymore.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.448
Great.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.539
You are becoming one of my

22:53.664 --> 22:54.874
all-time favorite customers.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.168
Aw, aren't you sweet?

22:59.920 --> 23:01.005
You're under arrest

23:01.130 --> 23:02.923
for drug possession
with the intent to sell.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.091
You gotta be kidding me.

23:04.217 --> 23:06.844
Come on. After all
those times I hooked you up?

23:06.969 --> 23:08.428
Just can't trust
anyone these days.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.430
So do you want
to do the ten years

23:10.556 --> 23:12.058
I can nail you on right now,

23:12.183 --> 23:13.851
or do you want
to vouch for me
to your boss?

23:13.976 --> 23:17.146
Give me a sit-down and let him
know how I'm your newest dealer?

23:23.236 --> 23:24.778
Fancy meeting you here.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.989
I know. Nine bedrooms
in the house

23:27.114 --> 23:28.866
and I still have to share
a bathroom with Dixon.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.868
Ooh, poor Dixon.

23:30.993 --> 23:33.620
'Cause as I recall,
you were never really
good at sharing.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.248
Hey, only where
French fries are concerned.

23:35.373 --> 23:37.499
You know, this isn't
how I pictured us

23:37.624 --> 23:39.001
on the eve of your
16th birthday,

23:39.126 --> 23:39.960
but I'm glad I'm here.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.837
It was nice of you to come.

23:41.962 --> 23:44.506
Yeah, but weird, too.

23:44.631 --> 23:45.925
Yeah, right?
Yeah.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.134
I'm, I'm sorry.
Is that mean?

23:47.260 --> 23:49.053
No, not at all.

23:49.178 --> 23:50.263
Actually, it's exactly what

23:50.388 --> 23:52.098
every ex-boyfriend/houseguest
wants to hear.

23:52.223 --> 23:56.018
Uh. Well, you know,
even with all the weirdness,

23:56.143 --> 23:58.229
I'm just glad
to have

23:58.354 --> 23:59.939
someone to hang out with
who doesn't make me feel

24:00.064 --> 24:01.065
like I have to try so hard.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.691
What do you mean?

24:02.816 --> 24:04.610
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, it's just

24:04.735 --> 24:07.905
I feel like I need to be so on
all the time.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.198
I mean, if they saw me

24:09.323 --> 24:10.657
hanging out
in plaid pajamas,

24:10.783 --> 24:13.202
it'd be, like,
"Ooh, social suicide."

24:13.327 --> 24:15.079
(chuckles)
I'd forgotten how much fun

24:15.204 --> 24:16.122
you were to be
around, Annie.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.164
You're sweet.

24:17.290 --> 24:20.209
You know what? That's a lie.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.963
I didn't forget. I tried.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.090
Believe me,
I tried.

24:26.215 --> 24:29.467
But Annie, our relationship...

24:31.845 --> 24:32.930
It was something special.

24:35.808 --> 24:36.850
Mm!

24:36.976 --> 24:37.851
DIXON:
Yo, Jason!

24:37.977 --> 24:39.061
Come on!
Let's go, man!

24:39.186 --> 24:41.855
Hey, come on.
I already set the game up.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.316
We're battling some dudes
from Michigan,

24:43.441 --> 24:44.691
and they already
talking trash.

24:44.817 --> 24:45.651
Come on, man.
Let's do this.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.487
Good night.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.574
(sighs)

24:59.039 --> 25:00.582
Jason, can I get you
anything else?

25:00.707 --> 25:01.583
No, ma'am, thank you.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.043
You know, when
you're at UCLA,

25:03.169 --> 25:05.129
you should really
come by and see us.
Absolutely.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.546
Now, do you need
any recommendations?

25:06.672 --> 25:07.756
I'd be happy to write you one.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.927
Ah! There is
the birthday girl!

25:12.052 --> 25:12.886
Happy birthday.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.138
Thank you.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.764
DEBBIE:
I cannot believe

25:15.889 --> 25:18.600
that you are
16 years old.
Sixteen.

25:18.725 --> 25:20.311
DEBBIE: Okay, I am late
for a photo shoot.

25:20.436 --> 25:21.937
Happy birthday.
Good-bye, my love.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.063
Bye, sweetie.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.564
Bye, Jason.
Bye.

25:24.690 --> 25:25.983
I got an early meeting
as well. Happy birthday.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.193
Okay. I love you.

25:27.318 --> 25:28.402
Jason. Love you,
too, baby.

25:28.526 --> 25:29.820
Nice to see you.
Good luck on your tour.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.529
Thank you. Thank you.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.492
So...

25:34.616 --> 25:37.786
uh, what are you gonna do,
one of those star homes tours?

25:37.911 --> 25:40.247
Campus tour, UCLA.

25:40.373 --> 25:41.748
Oh.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.209
If we're living close
to each other again,

25:43.334 --> 25:44.668
maybe things
might work out

25:44.793 --> 25:46.170
a little different for us.

25:46.295 --> 25:48.630
Um, Jason,

25:48.755 --> 25:50.341
um, I mean, who knows

25:50.466 --> 25:53.219
if we'd still be together,
if I hadn't moved?

25:53.344 --> 25:55.595
Maybe. Sure.

25:55.721 --> 25:56.596
But we broke up,

25:56.722 --> 25:59.683
and I moved on.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.601
So we're really over.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.103
Yeah.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.314
What about the kiss? I...

26:05.439 --> 26:07.107
You totally took me by surprise.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.193
And I am so sorry

26:09.318 --> 26:11.070
if I misled you in any way.

26:13.197 --> 26:14.240
Okay.

26:14.365 --> 26:16.033
Maybe I'll just go home.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.826
No, please,

26:17.951 --> 26:19.161
don't. Stay.

26:19.286 --> 26:21.621
I mean, the truth is,
we were friends for a long time

26:21.747 --> 26:23.623
before we started dating,
and I want

26:23.749 --> 26:25.459
all my friends
at my party tonight.

26:25.583 --> 26:28.586
So, come on. You can't deny
a girl's birthday wish, right?

26:35.386 --> 26:36.803
(knocking)

26:36.929 --> 26:38.097
ADRIANNA:
Hey.

26:38.222 --> 26:39.681
Hey.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.393
I'm sorry.
I was awkward last night.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.644
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
Yeah, my mom had no right

26:44.770 --> 26:46.021
to bring up that whole
rehab thing.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.566
Yeah, she did.
Your parents paid for it.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.317
But it's bad enough
that they had to bore you

26:50.443 --> 26:51.318
with those stupid stories.

26:51.444 --> 26:52.361
(laughs)

26:52.486 --> 26:53.653
It was cute.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.197
But how many servings
of khoresht

26:55.322 --> 26:57.491
do they expect one person
to eat, right?

26:57.615 --> 26:59.910
See, this, this is exactly
why I didn't want you

27:00.035 --> 27:02.246
to meet my family, because
they can be lame at times.

27:02.371 --> 27:06.500
Well, actually, I thought
they were lovely.

27:06.624 --> 27:08.252
You're just saying
that to be nice.

27:08.377 --> 27:12.089
No, seriously, I wish my family
was that big and close.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.341
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.718
So, yeah, obviously, I was a
little embarrassed when your mom

27:16.843 --> 27:18.011
brought up
the whole rehab thing,

27:18.137 --> 27:21.098
but the fact that they knew
the entire time,

27:21.223 --> 27:22.141
and they still treated me

27:22.266 --> 27:23.809
like a member
of the family,
Mm-hmm.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.936
that was incredibly cool.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.271
So we're good.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.065
I like you, Navid, okay?

27:30.190 --> 27:34.194
And the more I know,
the more I like.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.404
You just have to be
honest with me.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.284
About everything?

27:40.409 --> 27:42.660
Everything.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.790
Can you do that?

27:49.418 --> 27:51.044
I'm a virgin.
(chuckles)

27:51.170 --> 27:53.172
What? What?!

27:53.297 --> 27:54.423
See, funny, right?

27:54.548 --> 27:56.216
I didn't want
to disappoint you, okay?

27:56.342 --> 27:57.801
'Cause I figured you'd bolt,
so, uh...

27:57.926 --> 27:59.094
So you've been keeping
your distance.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.429
Yeah.

28:00.554 --> 28:03.098
I wanted, I wanted it
to be special.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.892
I thought you expected
something different,

28:06.018 --> 28:07.102
and you are so...

28:16.403 --> 28:18.738
I'm not expecting anything.

28:18.864 --> 28:19.906
No?

28:20.032 --> 28:22.284
No.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.120
(chuckles)
Except, um,

28:25.245 --> 28:27.080
a little less of that, um--

28:27.206 --> 28:29.041
what's your mom's favorite dish?

28:29.166 --> 28:30.125
Khoresht.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.503
Khore, khore...
I can't say it!

28:32.628 --> 28:33.920
Back of the throat.
Khoresht.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.047
Khoresht.
Yeah.

28:35.172 --> 28:37.132
Khoresht.
Khoresht?
You got it.

28:37.257 --> 28:38.467
(giggling)

28:43.305 --> 28:44.931
Hey, Annie.
Hmm?

28:45.057 --> 28:48.101
So, Jason seems
like a pretty
awesome guy.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.103
He's clearly still
into you.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.689
Maybe you guys should
give it another shot.

28:51.813 --> 28:55.942
Yeah, um, Naomi, about that,
thank you so much

28:56.068 --> 28:57.444
for flying Jason in.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.279
Hey, let's go out
again tonight.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.280
NAOMI:
It was so much fun
last night.

29:00.406 --> 29:01.365
We should totally
go to the beach.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.742
Maybe surfing.
Let me get back to you on that.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.288
Hey, are you still mad
about last night?

29:08.414 --> 29:09.748
Define mad.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.376
Look, I know the whole
having- my-current-boyfriend

29:12.501 --> 29:13.377
go-to-dinner-
with-my-ex-boyfriend-

29:13.502 --> 29:14.670

29:14.794 --> 29:16.255
isn't-really-a-boyfriend-
at-all thing

29:16.380 --> 29:19.007
is, is beyond-
the-charts strange, but...

29:19.132 --> 29:21.301
No, what's strange is being
in a situation

29:21.427 --> 29:22.302
that's so complicated

29:22.428 --> 29:23.887
that we can't even tell people

29:24.012 --> 29:25.472
we're together.
Does that make you happy?

29:25.598 --> 29:26.473
No.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.225
Me, neither.

29:28.350 --> 29:31.019
I've done complicated, Annie,
I didn't like it.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.231
I want things between us
to be simple, you know?

29:34.356 --> 29:35.315
I want that, too.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.192
Great, then let's

29:37.317 --> 29:40.153
clean this whole mess up and
tell Naomi and Jason the truth.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.030
Um...

29:42.155 --> 29:42.948
What?

29:43.073 --> 29:44.491
I just, I just want to wait

29:44.617 --> 29:47.369
until Jason gets home
to tell him.

29:47.494 --> 29:49.204
Why? You don't still have
feelings for him...

29:49.329 --> 29:51.206
No, no, um...

29:51.331 --> 29:52.916
no, but I think

29:53.041 --> 29:55.252
he still has them for me.

29:55.377 --> 29:58.922
Okay, don't
freak out, but

29:59.047 --> 30:00.549
Jason kissed me last night.

30:02.175 --> 30:03.385
Perfect.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.804
Come on, Ethan.
It just happened.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.473
You know why?
'Cause he thinks
you're still available.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.182
I didn't kiss him back.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.018
That was big of you.
Have fun with Jason.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.687
(scoffs)

30:26.241 --> 30:28.619
I never thought my
star detention guest

30:28.744 --> 30:30.454
could be on time
for anything.

30:30.579 --> 30:31.538
Only when it's important.

30:31.664 --> 30:33.039
This is important.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.584
You know,
you seem like a good kid.

30:35.709 --> 30:36.960
Seriously, dude,
I don't want to hear it.

30:37.085 --> 30:38.504
All I want to do
is make some cash.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.297
Get a job at Starbucks.

30:40.422 --> 30:44.176
Look, if you're not sure
about me, then just say it.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.303
Eric said he'd vouch for me
and that you'd hook me up.

30:46.428 --> 30:47.805
But if he bailed,

30:47.929 --> 30:49.848
then tell me now,
'cause I got clients waiting.

31:03.153 --> 31:06.198
You have no idea how long
I've waited for this.

31:06.323 --> 31:08.742
It takes a special kind of
sleazebag to sell drugs to kids.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.244

No, no, seriously,
thank you, Annie.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.345
Happy birthday.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.513
You're the best.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.519

everyone for being here

Annie, I know this isn't the
ordinary birthday dedication,

31:47.447 --> 31:50.283
but you're no ordinary girl.

I love you.

33:26.296 --> 33:28.841

33:28.966 --> 33:31.593
You were nothing but honest
with me about that kiss,

33:31.718 --> 33:34.429
and... I was a jerk.

33:34.554 --> 33:38.308
I would have gone

33:40.560 --> 33:41.812

33:41.937 --> 33:44.564
I had no right
to get mad at you

33:44.690 --> 33:47.400
when I was the one who got
us into this whole mess

keep Naomi in the dark.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.405
Yeah, well, you didn't
do it alone.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.283
I tried to tell her a bunch
of times and just totally

33:55.408 --> 33:56.952
chickened out.

33:57.076 --> 33:59.329
And I guess I didn't have
to hook up with you

33:59.454 --> 34:00.330
the minute you were

34:00.455 --> 34:01.414

I don't know.

I just need to get away,
you know, take some time

36:27.602 --> 36:28.520

36:28.645 --> 36:29.771
You know,
get out of town

after this, my mother's
going to do her big
closing number.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.775
I think we should pull
the plug on karaoke

38:38.900 --> 38:40.068
and get out the cake.

38:40.193 --> 38:41.903
Oh, but the kids really
seem to be enjoying her.

38:42.028 --> 38:42.988
I mean, how bad could it be?

38:43.113 --> 38:45.740
I think that it
involves pasties.

38:45.865 --> 38:48.493
I'll get the birthday girl.
Okay.

I'm sorry, but I saw you

38:52.872 --> 38:54.666
and it just freaked
me out a little bit.

38:54.791 --> 38:56.417
I mean, you could have told me
that you guys were together.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.170
Why'd you hide that?

38:58.295 --> 39:00.672
I... I didn't want
to hurt you.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.841
So instead you played
Naomi's game?

39:02.966 --> 39:04.425
The girl that I knew

39:04.550 --> 39:06.427
back in Kansas
was above that.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.096
You don't understand, okay?

39:08.221 --> 39:09.722
The rules are different here.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.350
But that doesn't mean
you have to be.

39:24.654 --> 39:26.990

Any requests?

(microphone feedback
whines)

40:08.948 --> 40:10.575
Just so I am clear,

40:10.700 --> 40:12.827
everything you have done--
the whole shopping trip,

40:12.952 --> 40:14.246
flying Jason out here,
all of that

40:14.371 --> 40:16.039
was just to set me up
to ruin my birthday?

40:16.164 --> 40:17.374
Absolutely.

If you want Ethan,
you can have him.

I wanted to see you miserable
and I got my wish.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.213
That's sick.

40:23.338 --> 40:25.506
Oh, don't give me that
holier-than-thou routine.
You're no innocent here.

40:25.631 --> 40:27.884
Okay, I-I should have
told you about Ethan.

40:28.009 --> 40:29.177
I will grant you that.

40:29.302 --> 40:31.554
I wanted to tell you.
But you didn't, did you?!

40:31.679 --> 40:33.514
No, instead you tried
to play me for a fool,

40:33.639 --> 40:35.683
you backstabbing,
duplicitous bitch!

40:35.808 --> 40:37.102
Okay, I was trying
to spare your feelings!

40:37.227 --> 40:38.644
I knew you would be upset,

40:38.770 --> 40:40.188
and so I was trying
to find the right time.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.107
But you didn't
even like Jason.

40:42.232 --> 40:43.691
You just went
after him to hurt me.

40:43.816 --> 40:44.692
You deserved it.

40:44.817 --> 40:48.780
I am so sick and tired
of all you people

40:48.905 --> 40:50.282
who won't tell
me the truth.

40:50.407 --> 40:51.908
First, with my dad
and his mistress.

40:52.033 --> 40:53.534
And-And then-then my
mother with her son...

40:53.659 --> 40:54.786
None of that
was my fault.

40:54.911 --> 40:56.746
All I know

40:56.871 --> 41:01.751
is that before you moved here,
my life was perfectly fine!

41:01.876 --> 41:04.921
No, before I moved here,
you were just lying to yourself

41:05.046 --> 41:06.256
and getting away with it.

41:06.381 --> 41:07.882
You'd rather have
people fear you

41:08.007 --> 41:10.509
then be honest with you.

41:10.635 --> 41:12.304
You're manipulative
and cruel

41:12.429 --> 41:14.306
and the only person
that you should be blaming

41:14.431 --> 41:16.599
for feeling so alone
right now is you.

41:18.851 --> 41:21.562
That all you got, Kansas?

41:21.687 --> 41:24.274
Listen to me.

41:24.399 --> 41:27.110
Being your friend--
I'm over it.

41:27.235 --> 41:28.903

I already beat you to it.

41:29.028 --> 41:31.572
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you ladies.
