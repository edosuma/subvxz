11:21.873 --> 11:23.276
Damn.

11:23.309 --> 11:24.846
Can't a Native live?

11:24.879 --> 11:26.082
You said it, sib.

11:26.115 --> 11:27.384
Tino.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.021
My name's Tino.

11:29.054 --> 11:30.524
Where'd you get "sib"?

11:30.557 --> 11:32.394
It's...

11:32.427 --> 11:34.365
it's short for "sibling," man.

11:34.398 --> 11:36.235
Oh.

11:36.268 --> 11:38.807
Word. Word.

11:53.102 --> 11:54.471
(Gene sighs)

11:54.505 --> 11:56.042
Yeah, can I help you?

11:56.075 --> 11:58.881
Hey, um,
I'm here to pick up Cheese.

11:58.914 --> 12:00.116
Who?

12:00.149 --> 12:02.020
Uh, Chester.

12:02.053 --> 12:04.224
I'm-I'm his auntie.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.861
(laughs)

12:06.863 --> 12:08.534
How old are you?

12:08.567 --> 12:10.170
What's that matter?

12:10.203 --> 12:12.842
You don't look old enough
to be Chester's auntie.

12:12.875 --> 12:16.315
Indian ways. I got a niece
who's 58 years old, just...

12:16.348 --> 12:18.119
Oh, right, right, right, right.

12:18.152 --> 12:20.123
Well, look, even if I did
believe you, he's in our custody

12:20.156 --> 12:22.060
until the court says otherwise.

12:22.093 --> 12:24.198
Well, he's pretty much been in
my care for the past two years.

12:24.231 --> 12:25.868
And he ended up here, wow.

12:25.901 --> 12:27.270
Good job.

12:31.378 --> 12:33.116
Nice.

12:33.149 --> 12:34.819
WILLIE JACK:
Cheese.

12:34.852 --> 12:37.357
-Yo, let's go.
-What are you guys doing here?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.496
Get your shit, bro.
We're busting you out of here.

12:39.529 --> 12:41.065
I don't think
that's how that works.

12:41.098 --> 12:42.568
Come on, man, <i>Shawshank,</i> sko!

12:42.601 --> 12:45.206
-How would I even get out?
-Just parkour it, man.

12:45.239 --> 12:47.077
-Hey, Jackie.
-What's up?

12:47.110 --> 12:48.514
-What's-- wh-where's Elora?
-WILLIE JACK: Doing her shit.

12:48.547 --> 12:49.883
She's distracting the guards,
bro, let's go.

12:49.916 --> 12:51.285
Again, I'm sorry.

12:51.318 --> 12:52.420
There's nothing I can do.

12:55.861 --> 12:57.865
Maybe this will help you
change your mind?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.939
There's more
where that came from, too.

13:05.146 --> 13:07.084
Okay.

13:07.117 --> 13:09.889
Well, I'm calling the cops.

13:12.995 --> 13:14.398
(door locks)

13:14.431 --> 13:15.433
(indistinct chatter)

13:15.466 --> 13:16.970
We ain't got time for this shit.

13:17.003 --> 13:18.239
GENE: Chester, you better
fucking be up there!

13:18.272 --> 13:20.110
Shit, the house manager's

13:20.143 --> 13:21.980
-coming back.
-What are you still
doing up there?

13:22.013 --> 13:24.184
-We got to go.
-Jump down.
-What? No.

13:24.217 --> 13:25.988
Man, I'll catch you.
I got upper body strength, bro.

13:26.021 --> 13:27.558
No, I mean, it's illegal.

13:27.591 --> 13:30.230
I know, all right, you guys
got to find another way.

13:30.263 --> 13:33.068
Remember me, all right?

13:34.237 --> 13:36.843
-What the fuck was that?
-What the fuck?

13:40.483 --> 13:41.653
GENE:
God...

13:41.686 --> 13:43.189
ALL:
Grant me the serenity

13:43.222 --> 13:45.427
to accept the things
I cannot change,

13:45.460 --> 13:48.634
the courage to change
the things I can,

13:48.667 --> 13:52.340
and the wisdom to know
the difference.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.411
Peace.

14:00.958 --> 14:03.664
All right, so now...

14:03.697 --> 14:06.235
without further fuckery,
let's get into step five.

14:06.268 --> 14:08.072
Yes?

14:08.105 --> 14:09.475
What is this?

14:09.509 --> 14:11.613
What is this? This is...

14:11.646 --> 14:13.282
part of my recovery.

14:13.315 --> 14:16.288
When I was a young, little
shitass like you guys,

14:16.321 --> 14:18.594
about your age,
my life was in shambles.

14:18.627 --> 14:22.367
I was a drunk, drug addict,
I was an abuser, I was a thief.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.106
There wasn't anything
I didn't smoke or snort

14:25.139 --> 14:26.943
or drink or fuck even.

14:26.976 --> 14:28.981
And then I hit a wall,
I hit my bottom.

14:29.014 --> 14:32.420
About three days
into a bad bender,

14:32.453 --> 14:35.226
I finally made my way back home,

14:35.259 --> 14:38.132
walk into my house, and, uh...

14:38.165 --> 14:40.103
in my bedroom I found my wife,

14:40.136 --> 14:41.706
two midgets...

14:41.739 --> 14:44.244
and a DJ.

14:44.277 --> 14:45.981
AM radio DJ.

14:46.014 --> 14:48.687
Pretty popular--
I didn't, I didn't like him

14:48.720 --> 14:51.025
even before he fucked my wife,
but it doesn't matter.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.029
I just lost my mind.

14:53.062 --> 14:54.532
I literally lost my mind.

14:54.565 --> 14:56.970
And I chased those midgets
out of my house.

14:57.003 --> 14:58.372
Naked midgets.

14:58.405 --> 15:00.410
Running out into the street.

15:00.443 --> 15:03.115
And I went back in
and I was gonna kill that DJ.

15:03.148 --> 15:04.986
I was gonna kill him
with my own hands.

15:05.019 --> 15:07.658
But, but he was... big.

15:07.691 --> 15:10.430
He just kicked my ass.

15:10.463 --> 15:12.467
I think he's still with my wife.
It doesn't matter.

15:12.501 --> 15:15.406
Threw me out of my own house,
and I just...

15:15.439 --> 15:17.277
wandered into the woods.

15:17.310 --> 15:19.380
But that's where I met
the Lakota medicine man.

15:20.717 --> 15:22.555
Wakan Mani.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.291
He picked me up by the scruff.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.694
Showed me the ways.

15:25.727 --> 15:27.297
Changed my life.

15:27.330 --> 15:29.268
Very grateful.

15:29.301 --> 15:31.138
I'm a better man now.

15:31.171 --> 15:33.309
I'm even kind of friendly
with one of the midgets.

15:33.342 --> 15:36.215
These things can happen
when you're sober.

15:36.248 --> 15:38.754
Yeah, so that's my story.

15:38.787 --> 15:40.423
Why don't you start?

15:40.456 --> 15:43.296
Take this and,
uh, read step five and...

15:43.329 --> 15:45.433
give us a few words
from your heart.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.572
"Step five.

15:47.605 --> 15:49.742
"Admitting our wrongs
to a higher power

15:49.775 --> 15:52.046
and to those around us."

15:53.082 --> 15:54.719
Well, I ain't done shit wrong
since last week,

15:54.752 --> 15:58.092
so I'm good to go, bro.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.029
And with that, I'll pass.

16:00.062 --> 16:01.733
Pass.

16:01.766 --> 16:04.605
Come on, James...
a little something, nothing?

16:08.245 --> 16:10.517
Pass.

16:10.550 --> 16:12.254
(sighs)

16:12.287 --> 16:14.258
-Um, I'll-I'll pass.
-No.

16:14.291 --> 16:17.296
You're the new guy, just say
a few words about your week.

16:18.767 --> 16:21.138
I was arrested for no reason.

16:21.171 --> 16:22.808
Um...

16:22.841 --> 16:26.516
I was sent
to a poorly funded group home.

16:26.549 --> 16:28.051
There's that.

16:29.187 --> 16:32.093
And I really hate it here.

16:32.126 --> 16:34.499
Okay, well...

16:34.532 --> 16:36.736
thanks for your honesty.
See that, James?

16:36.769 --> 16:38.740
Bare minimum.
That was the bare minimum.

16:38.773 --> 16:41.177
I have something to say.

16:46.556 --> 16:48.259
Tino.

16:48.292 --> 16:49.361
Hmm?

16:49.394 --> 16:50.531
What's wrong with your <i>bicho?</i>

16:50.564 --> 16:51.800
Fuck you just call me?

16:51.833 --> 16:53.302
Every time
I walk in the bathroom,

16:53.335 --> 16:54.639
there's nothing
but pee everywhere.

16:54.672 --> 16:56.442
What, you have no aim?

16:56.475 --> 16:58.513
Oh, maybe you got nothing
down there, so it just sprays

16:58.546 --> 17:00.851
all over the floor,
the seat, the fucking roof.

17:00.884 --> 17:02.253
-(laughs)
-You're a fucking snitch, Julio.

17:02.286 --> 17:03.322
All right, calm down.

17:03.355 --> 17:04.257
-Oh, I'm a snitch?
-Yeah.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.694
I walk in the bathroom

17:05.727 --> 17:07.565
wearing my socks,
guess what I'm stepping in.

17:07.598 --> 17:10.135
-Your fucking pee!
-All right, we get it,
we get it.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.144
Once again,
everyone has failed to engage

17:14.177 --> 17:15.814
with the step.

17:15.847 --> 17:17.718
Except for Chester.

17:17.751 --> 17:19.388
Little bit.

17:19.421 --> 17:21.392
Doesn't matter.

17:21.425 --> 17:23.664
I'm just happy you're all
walking this path with me.

17:23.697 --> 17:25.701
And, um...

17:25.734 --> 17:27.805
Fuck it.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.508
Let's call it.

17:31.478 --> 17:33.449
Fucking love you, girl.

17:33.482 --> 17:36.254
You gonna be the mother
of my child someday.

17:38.359 --> 17:40.263
You're the stars in the sky.

17:40.296 --> 17:43.570
You're my moon, you're the sun.

17:43.603 --> 17:45.674
Yeah, you're all of those.

17:45.707 --> 17:47.344
Hey, James.

17:47.377 --> 17:50.216
Can I use the phone
before chores start?

17:50.249 --> 17:51.619
I just, I just need
to make a quick call.

17:51.652 --> 17:54.324
Real quick,
it'll only be a minute.

17:54.357 --> 17:56.763
I know. I know.

17:56.796 --> 17:59.368
I'll ride with you wherever.

17:59.401 --> 18:01.205
This'll only make us
stronger, baby.

18:01.238 --> 18:03.610
Um... James, seriously.

18:03.643 --> 18:05.714
-I just need to check in.
-It's nothing, baby.

18:05.747 --> 18:08.486
Just some dude who's about
to get his ass beat

18:08.520 --> 18:11.324
if he don't step back and let
me talk to the love of my life.

18:13.262 --> 18:14.464
You're my queen...

18:14.498 --> 18:16.569
(sighs)
Fucking James.

18:16.602 --> 18:18.172
-Shit.
-Hell yeah.

18:18.205 --> 18:20.343
-TINO: Yep.
-You trying to call your
girl, too?

18:20.376 --> 18:22.447
No, my-my grandma.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.784
I just want
to tell her I'm okay.

18:23.817 --> 18:25.319
I don't want her to worry.

18:25.352 --> 18:26.488
JAMES: You're this world
and you're everything

18:26.522 --> 18:28.627
out of this world.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.697
Shit.

18:32.634 --> 18:34.539
JAMES:
My love for you is
as deep as the Grand Canyon.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.676
Don't let that fucking Gene
see you with this.

18:36.709 --> 18:40.483
And don't look
at my recently deleted photos.

18:40.517 --> 18:43.757
Don't look at any of my photos.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.928
Make sure you use it tonight

18:45.961 --> 18:47.864
after Gene goes to sleep.

18:48.833 --> 18:50.504
(snoring)

18:50.537 --> 18:52.340
-But he is asleep.
-I said tonight.

18:52.373 --> 18:54.478
JAMES:
When I get out of here,
let's get away.

18:54.512 --> 18:55.714
Okay.

19:08.606 --> 19:11.612
(dialing)

19:13.817 --> 19:15.820
(line ringing)

19:20.797 --> 19:22.768
<i>IRENE:
Hello.</i>

19:22.801 --> 19:24.705
Grandma?

19:24.738 --> 19:26.375
Um...

19:26.408 --> 19:28.580
it's Cheese.

19:28.613 --> 19:30.316
<i>Who?</i>

19:30.349 --> 19:32.788
Cheese, um...

19:32.821 --> 19:34.592
we met at IHS.

19:34.625 --> 19:37.263
I've been coming over
to your house every week.

19:37.296 --> 19:39.401

19:39.434 --> 19:41.539

19:41.572 --> 19:43.409
(chuckles softly)

19:43.442 --> 19:44.712
I just-- I'm sorry, I just,

19:44.745 --> 19:46.415
I just thought that maybe,
maybe you...

19:46.448 --> 19:48.553
<i>You thought
I finally lost my marbles?</i>

19:48.586 --> 19:50.958
<i>Still sharp as a tack, my boy.</i>

19:50.991 --> 19:53.395
<i>Where have you been?</i>

19:53.428 --> 19:55.299
<i>I miss you.</i>

19:55.332 --> 19:57.571
<i>You need to come by for sofkee.</i>

19:57.604 --> 20:00.677
Um, I miss you, too.

20:00.710 --> 20:03.717
Um, I've just, I've been helping
Uncle Charlie with some stuff.

20:03.750 --> 20:06.823
And, um, I've been trying
to come over.

20:06.856 --> 20:09.996
Um... hopefully soon.

20:10.029 --> 20:13.703

20:37.618 --> 20:39.855
-Good night.
<i>-Night.</i>

20:43.428 --> 20:45.466
(phone closes)

20:49.642 --> 20:51.946
Okay, Jedthrow Brown, let's go.

20:51.979 --> 20:53.482
Time to go.

20:53.516 --> 20:54.752
-Sorry.
-Man, fuck.

20:54.785 --> 20:55.954
-Let's get going.
-Fuck.

20:55.987 --> 20:57.658
-Sorry, son.
-Goddamn!

20:57.691 --> 20:59.529
-Can I put some clothes on?
Shit.
-Yes.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.599
God, what, you want to help?

21:01.632 --> 21:02.935
You want to help me put
on my fucking chonies?

21:02.968 --> 21:04.772
Fucking diddler.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.609
Okay, son, just put
your clothes on, cooperate.

21:06.642 --> 21:07.878
-Don't fucking "son" me.
-I...

21:07.911 --> 21:09.515
You're the worst one
of them all.

21:09.548 --> 21:10.651
What kind of dude hangs out
with underage boys

21:10.684 --> 21:12.420
all day and night?

21:12.453 --> 21:14.492
"Billie Jean"-ass dude, <i>K-PAX,</i>

21:14.525 --> 21:16.028
<i>House of Cards</i> looking ass,
God.

21:16.061 --> 21:18.800
Fucking cold in here.
Look, my nipples are cold.

21:18.833 --> 21:20.637
Look! Look!
Yeah, that's what I thought.

21:20.670 --> 21:23.643
Sick! ACAD!
All cops are diddlers!

21:23.676 --> 21:25.814
Man, kiss my ass, motherfucker!

21:25.847 --> 21:28.452
(sighs)
All right, uh...

21:28.485 --> 21:30.957
Lot of excitement, lot of drama.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.897
I'm a little triggered. Anybody?

21:33.930 --> 21:35.767
You want to get
a snack or something?

21:35.800 --> 21:37.705
Group hug?

21:37.738 --> 21:40.042
Quick point, though--
not all cops are diddlers.

21:40.075 --> 21:42.915
I'm not saying they're not,
you know, morally dubious.

21:42.948 --> 21:45.419
But, you know,
not all of them are...

21:45.452 --> 21:46.823
Let's... let's have a snack.

21:46.856 --> 21:49.060
Let's go downstairs, come on.

21:50.630 --> 21:52.968
Man, Jed had the right idea
with these pigs.

21:53.001 --> 21:54.471
You swing on 'em,
they'll kill your ass.

21:54.505 --> 21:55.974
So you at least got
to talk shit.

21:56.007 --> 21:57.678
JULIO:
You got to do that.

21:57.711 --> 21:59.982
When they arrest me,
I'm gonna tell them,

22:00.015 --> 22:02.688
"Ask your mother
if she misses these nuts."

22:02.721 --> 22:04.959
-(laughs)
-Fucking hate these guys.

22:04.992 --> 22:07.397
I try to stay
on their good side.

22:07.430 --> 22:09.869
Maybe they'll think
I didn't do anything wrong.

22:09.902 --> 22:11.739
Bullshit!
That's being a coward, bro.

22:11.772 --> 22:13.810
No, seriously, a while back,

22:13.843 --> 22:15.079
my friends and I,
we stole a chip truck.

22:15.112 --> 22:16.950
We stole it
right in front of a gas station.

22:16.983 --> 22:19.087
-And we sold it
to some meth heads.
-BOTH: Damn!

22:19.120 --> 22:21.826
-That's hard, though.
-Then I convinced the cop
that was investigating us

22:21.859 --> 22:23.095
to take me on a ride-along.

22:23.128 --> 22:24.832
I told him it was
a school project.

22:24.865 --> 22:26.435
Hell no.

22:26.468 --> 22:27.838
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

22:27.871 --> 22:29.007
Like Don Corleone
in these streets.

22:29.040 --> 22:31.111
Yeah, except, uh,

22:31.144 --> 22:34.050
I don't have any kids
and I'm more like a Tom Hagen.

22:34.083 --> 22:36.522
Hmm, well, I guess I'm the Don.

22:36.555 --> 22:39.160
I just hope all my kids
don't turn out to be Fredos.

22:39.193 --> 22:41.633
I knew you for two years.

22:41.666 --> 22:43.603
You never told me you had kids.

22:43.636 --> 22:46.509
Yeah, well, we don't talk much.
That's why I'm always

22:46.542 --> 22:48.479
asking you to hook me up
at your job.

22:48.513 --> 22:50.049
A Native trying
to change his ways.

22:50.082 --> 22:52.119
I can't have my kids
growing up like I did.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.459
I'm sorry, man.

22:55.493 --> 22:57.130
I always thought
you were just fucking with me.

22:57.163 --> 23:00.671
There's so many people
that come and go here,

23:00.704 --> 23:02.508
sometimes I think it's better
to just be alone.

23:02.541 --> 23:03.943
You get to know somebody,

23:03.976 --> 23:05.747
and they go get arrested
or something,

23:05.780 --> 23:08.052
then you never see them again.

23:08.085 --> 23:10.557
I think it's okay
to guard your feelings

23:10.590 --> 23:12.761
with barriers, Julio,
but I hope

23:12.794 --> 23:15.132
that one day you can have
a healthy relationship

23:15.165 --> 23:17.169
with people
without fear of losing them.

23:18.506 --> 23:20.476
Why the fuck you talk like that?

23:20.510 --> 23:21.879
Talk like what?

23:21.912 --> 23:23.883
Like you reading from
a white girl's Instagram.

23:23.916 --> 23:24.919
Oh, he queer.

23:24.952 --> 23:28.626
I had a friend. Um, Daniel.

23:28.659 --> 23:31.164
He was like a...
he was like my hero.

23:31.197 --> 23:34.037
But, uh, then he died.

23:34.070 --> 23:36.976
Well, he, uh,
he ended his own life.

23:37.009 --> 23:39.047
And I just...

23:39.080 --> 23:41.652
I read about some reasons
why he might've did it.

23:41.685 --> 23:44.624
And, um, it's just hard
for people.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.196
I just thought that maybe

23:47.229 --> 23:49.502
if I treated others

23:49.535 --> 23:52.508
the way they wanted to be
treated, they would do the same.

23:52.541 --> 23:54.512
Eventually.

23:54.545 --> 23:56.949
I'm sorry about your homie, bro.

23:56.982 --> 23:58.987
It's hard out here for people.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.991
I get it.

24:01.024 --> 24:03.028
You're a good man, Cheese.

24:04.698 --> 24:06.268
GENE:
Lights out, shitasses!

24:06.301 --> 24:08.539
(scoffs)

24:10.309 --> 24:12.280
-Hey, Tino.
-What's up?

24:12.313 --> 24:15.554
There's an opening at my job.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.123
I'll talk to my boss for you.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.160
(indistinct chatter nearby)

24:27.243 --> 24:29.515
Morning.
We're having dry toast again?

24:29.548 --> 24:30.684
Damn!

24:30.717 --> 24:32.588
Shirt is all wrinkled up.

24:32.621 --> 24:34.190
Don't disrespect
the queen like that.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.261
Mm-mm, come on.

24:36.294 --> 24:38.132
-Come with me.
-It's Sade, though.

24:38.165 --> 24:39.802
It's the queen of love to you.

24:39.835 --> 24:41.739
You want to smooth the fabric

24:41.772 --> 24:43.610
with your hand,

24:43.643 --> 24:45.146
ahead of the iron.

24:45.179 --> 24:48.252
Always careful not

24:48.285 --> 24:50.923
to burn yourself, hmm?

24:52.727 --> 24:54.598
No! Whoa, whoa,

24:54.631 --> 24:55.967
whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.704
You're gonna fuck up
the whole shirt.

24:57.737 --> 25:00.209
Ease into it, take your time.

25:00.242 --> 25:02.581
Like a good Sade song, hmm?

25:02.614 --> 25:03.850
Mm-hmm.

25:03.883 --> 25:06.556
Yeah! That's it.

25:06.589 --> 25:08.893
Uh-huh, see, now you're ready
to get everybody pregnant

25:08.926 --> 25:10.964
-with your looks.
-(laughs)

25:10.997 --> 25:12.868
(chuckles)

25:12.901 --> 25:14.972
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

25:15.005 --> 25:17.811
(indistinct chatter)

25:28.031 --> 25:30.169
GENE:
All right, Chester.

25:30.202 --> 25:31.973
Time to go.

25:32.006 --> 25:33.007
Get your shit together.

25:34.645 --> 25:37.016
-Hey, is that the cop
you made your bitch?
-Shh!

25:37.049 --> 25:38.051
-Hey, Cheese.
-Hey.

25:39.621 --> 25:42.795
Sorry, but I got to put
these handcuffs on you.

25:42.828 --> 25:44.264
Stand up.

25:44.297 --> 25:45.867
Turn around.

25:49.842 --> 25:51.813
Eh, hold on.

25:51.846 --> 25:54.083
Mind if I talk shit
while you do it?

25:54.116 --> 25:56.288
Ah... fine.

25:56.321 --> 25:58.192
Just don't make it too personal.

25:58.225 --> 26:00.062
All right.

26:00.095 --> 26:02.768
-This guy's a child molester.
-Ah, Jesus fuck!

26:02.801 --> 26:05.172
Fucking shitass, quit now.

26:05.205 --> 26:08.078
-Thank you.
-Hey, you mind if I show
little homie some love

26:08.111 --> 26:10.316
before you take him to prison?

26:10.349 --> 26:12.320
-Be quick.
-Hey.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.190
Come see me at Red Lobster
when I get the job.

26:14.223 --> 26:16.161
I ain't gonna hook you up
with free food or nothing,

26:16.194 --> 26:19.033
but it'll be tight as fuck
to see a bro on the outside.

26:19.066 --> 26:20.770
I'll miss you, man.

26:20.803 --> 26:22.373
Give your kids all my love.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.678
And be good to their grandmas.

26:24.711 --> 26:25.947
I got you.

26:25.980 --> 26:28.653
What you looking at,
then, diddler?

26:28.686 --> 26:29.921
You see something you like?

26:31.992 --> 26:33.930
Fucking shitasses.

26:33.963 --> 26:35.165

26:37.102 --> 26:38.973

26:43.883 --> 26:45.920
You will always be my friend.

26:47.122 --> 26:48.960
Cool.

26:48.993 --> 26:50.930
Come on.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.705
What'd he say?

26:54.738 --> 26:57.210
He said he'd always be
your friend.

26:57.243 --> 26:59.714
CHEESE:
I got that much.

27:08.766 --> 27:10.803
Can I sit in the front again?

27:13.275 --> 27:14.911
(Big grunts)

27:16.180 --> 27:19.020

27:19.053 --> 27:21.291
Hey, hey, quit now.

27:21.324 --> 27:23.128
Thing's finally just dead.

27:23.161 --> 27:24.999
That's a good thing, too.

27:25.032 --> 27:27.370
Can be alone with our thoughts.

27:27.403 --> 27:29.107
Where are we going?

27:29.140 --> 27:30.844
Your new placement.

27:30.877 --> 27:32.748
New placement.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.417
Great.

27:34.450 --> 27:36.855
Sounds awesome.
