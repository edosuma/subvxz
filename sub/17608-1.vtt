An <i>Ears Wide Shut</i> exclusive.
Talking about our g-g-generation.

01:56.270 --> 01:59.570
And, next on the show is <i>Morning Breez</i>
with Sheila Browning,

01:59.570 --> 02:02.770
on 87.9, Seattle's
public broadcast.

02:05.610 --> 02:07.980
I've gotta go
like five minutes ago.

02:07.980 --> 02:09.780
- Oh...
- Jeez...

02:09.780 --> 02:11.310
Say hi
to the Brown Shirts for us.

02:12.650 --> 02:14.180
- Hi, Sheila.
- Hi.

02:14.180 --> 02:18.620
- Hi.
- I have three passes to the Arctic yoga center.

02:18.620 --> 02:21.090
- Interested?
- I think I'll take a pass.

02:21.090 --> 02:24.190
Oh, yay, because ice yoga
is so trans-formative.

02:24.190 --> 02:26.430
Well, no, I mean I'll pass
on the pass.

02:26.430 --> 02:28.030
- Okay, Ethan.
- Understand?

02:28.030 --> 02:32.330
- Listen, a sub zero body stretch in a cryo tank.
- Okay, mmm-hmm.

02:32.340 --> 02:35.840
- How can you say no?
- Read my lips, no ice yoga.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.510
Thank you, though. Have fun.

02:43.910 --> 02:46.280
Sorry, we had
a live musical guest.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.480
You're the producer
of this show.

02:48.490 --> 02:51.050
You wanna be an exclusive
employee of the Tree Humpers

02:51.050 --> 02:52.720
down the hall,
go ahead be my guest.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.820
- It won't happen again.
- You're damn right it won't happen again.

02:55.830 --> 02:58.190
I'm trusting you with this
show while I'm gone.

02:58.200 --> 03:00.600
Do try to be on time.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.400
It's a matter
of self respect, ultimately.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.270
<i>Get ready for two hours with the
mic from the right,</i>

03:06.270 --> 03:09.200
<i>the sage from Seattle,
Mr. Tom Fleischman.</i>

03:09.940 --> 03:12.670
All right, folks.

03:12.680 --> 03:17.550
Well, the demon libs are
up to their old tricks again.

03:17.550 --> 03:20.820
Their latest ploy
in dealing with the deficit,

03:20.820 --> 03:24.850
is to raise the sales tax
on a cup of Joe?

03:24.850 --> 03:29.790
And their other brilliant idea,
and I'm afraid this one may pass,

03:29.790 --> 03:34.200
is to ban all smoking around the
vicinity of the Space Needle?

03:34.200 --> 03:39.570
I mean why don't they just ban the internal
combustion engine while they are at it?

03:39.570 --> 03:40.740
Hello!

03:41.600 --> 03:43.570
All right.

03:43.570 --> 03:47.840
We have Cynthia from
Mount Rainier on the line.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.380
<i>First time calling,
long time admirer.</i>

03:50.380 --> 03:52.850
Well, thank you Cynthia.

03:52.850 --> 03:54.580
And what's on your mind?

03:54.580 --> 03:56.650
<i>Oh, you're
on my mind, Tommy.</i>

03:56.650 --> 03:58.750
Ever since I first laid ears
on you,

03:58.760 --> 04:01.920
<i>I used to be an extremely
fertile liberal, liberal.</i>

04:01.930 --> 04:05.660
Well, am glad to know we've
opened your eyes.

04:05.660 --> 04:08.560
Oh, you've opened up
a lot of things in me, Tommy.

04:08.570 --> 04:12.200
<i>Before I was selling crack
to support a crank habit.</i>

04:12.200 --> 04:14.470
<i>Mixing Miley with Molly.</i>

04:14.470 --> 04:17.370
<i>- Even hooking kept the cable on.
- Heavens!</i>

04:19.540 --> 04:22.740
I know I've had nine abortions
in a six month span.

04:22.750 --> 04:26.480
But, thanks to you, Tommy, those dark and lustful,
orgasmic nights are gone.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.750
- You showed me the light and you turned me on. Oh!
- You!

04:31.090 --> 04:32.520
I caught you red handed.

04:34.390 --> 04:36.160
My hands are not red.

04:36.160 --> 04:39.490
I was in the middle of a tender, gender
neutral moment with my girlfriend.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.330
And you interrupted it.

04:41.330 --> 04:43.260
You one of those
anti-American punks?

04:43.270 --> 04:47.640
Well, I'm more anti-stupidity but, you
guys have monopolized that lately.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.170
Just...

04:50.170 --> 04:52.140
You're a card carrying
pussy, Ethan.

04:58.980 --> 05:02.720
Listen, Adrienne, look I saw a movie
once about a real live talking Jedi.

05:02.720 --> 05:05.490
I'm telling you what, it freaked
me out, I almost switched teams.

05:10.030 --> 05:11.790
- Adrienne...
- It's so ridiculous.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.760
It's not ridiculous.
It's not ridiculous, Adrienne.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.370
Um, could we talk about the duplex
and your down payment, please?

05:18.370 --> 05:22.070
Hey, Adrienne, do you remember I can't pay
for anything. I'm cash poor, you know that.

05:22.070 --> 05:25.710
I know because you sunk your freaking
money into a donut holes scheme.

05:25.710 --> 05:28.880
Which deep fried
your credit score.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.310
Listen, Doughglobes
has franchise potential

05:31.310 --> 05:33.850
A franchise
is like Starbucks, okay?

05:33.850 --> 05:38.920
Colonel Sanders was holed up in a gunny
shack in the middle of Monroe, Kentucky,

05:38.920 --> 05:40.120
now look where he is.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.460
Here's your food.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.790
Thank you. Awesome.
That looks... That's amazing.

05:43.790 --> 05:46.390
Thank you so much.
That's really nice.

05:46.400 --> 05:49.000
- What is this stuff?
- It's vegan.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.800
Listen let's just switch subjects,
I've got really good news.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.300
- You do?
- I do.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.900
Great.
What are we talking about?

05:55.910 --> 05:57.110
A voice over part.

05:57.910 --> 05:59.810
Honey! Honey!

05:59.810 --> 06:02.610
- Thank you. Great.
- 1500 dollars.

06:02.610 --> 06:04.850
That's even
better. Nice.

06:04.850 --> 06:07.920
- Okay.
- Yup. We have to use your studio.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.020
- Is that cool?
- Yeah.

06:09.020 --> 06:11.120
No, seriously. That's great.
Definitely. Yeah, sure.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.840
Governor Sollow promises a
cleaner environment and yet,

06:33.840 --> 06:38.050
his administration has side stepped the
natural wildlife act at every turn.

06:38.050 --> 06:39.150
Gutting some 50,000...

06:39.150 --> 06:41.150
More forceful at the end.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.790
Baby, if you didn't stare me down the
whole time too that might be helpful too.

06:43.790 --> 06:45.720
- Cause you're just kind of...
- What?

06:47.320 --> 06:51.530
...his administration has side stepped
the natural wildlife act at every turn.

06:51.530 --> 06:56.130
Gutting some 50,000 acres of our
state's most pristine forestry.

06:56.130 --> 07:01.600
The Sierra club recently called Governor
Sollow a great environmental disappointment.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.070
Governor Sollow,
how low will he go?

07:05.070 --> 07:07.040
Oh, great right hook.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.640
Right on the kisser.

07:08.650 --> 07:10.110
- I think you did it.
- Great.

07:11.110 --> 07:12.510
Great job.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.550
- Excellent job. Hi.
- Oh, thank you. Hi.

07:14.550 --> 07:16.380
- Susan.
- I'm Ethan. Nice to meet you.

07:16.390 --> 07:21.090
Oh, yes, so I finally get to meet
Adrienne's mystery boyfriend.

07:21.090 --> 07:22.060
Yeah.

07:22.060 --> 07:23.860
I'd love for you to meet
my daughter, Julia.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.560
Hi, so nice to meet you. So great to
have another soldier on the ground.

07:27.560 --> 07:28.800
Yeah, it's great to be here.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.270
We just got her back
after a year in the Sudan.

07:31.270 --> 07:33.500
That's cool, I'm, uh, I'm Ethan.

07:33.940 --> 07:34.840
Hi.

07:36.210 --> 07:39.540
So, listen I'm willing to pull
out all the stops for you.

07:39.540 --> 07:43.780
'Cause I think you're amazing and I'm here.
So, if you need me...

07:43.780 --> 07:45.910
Thank you, Adrienne. I love
your energy. And you're

07:45.920 --> 07:48.820
already proving invaluable.
Everything is just great.

07:48.820 --> 07:51.650
You know what we really should get
going, you've got that, uh...

07:51.650 --> 07:53.550
That interview with
<i>The Post.</i>

07:53.560 --> 07:56.060
You've got that fund-raiser with the preschool.
And a brunch with Aaron Ivenson

07:56.060 --> 07:59.160
Oh, well, what I need
is a strong cup of coffee.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.760
Oh, Doughglobes has coffee.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.830
- I don't know what Doughglobes is.
- It's a donut.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.770
I don't, I don't really
understand you.

08:04.770 --> 08:08.240
Anyway, thank you so much.
I can't wait. This is great.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.440
Nice meeting you guys.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.040
- Nice to meet you, bye.
- Bye, nice to meet you.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.980
Thanks for the gig,
I really appreciate it.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.380
It's helping out a lot.

08:15.380 --> 08:17.750
You're not getting
paid for this.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.110
What are you talking about?

08:19.120 --> 08:21.720
I mean that goes against the
8000 dollars that you owe me.

08:21.720 --> 08:26.020
If you want to put a down payment on a duplex,
that's your decision, not mine.

08:26.020 --> 08:28.660
First of all,
we had a verbal agreement.

08:28.660 --> 08:30.760
Adrienne, you're ridiculous.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.960
Okay, you know what,
that hey...

08:32.960 --> 08:36.100
- You know what, that's fine.
- See you, Adrienne.

08:40.970 --> 08:44.169
<i>Gold, the universal
symbol of wealth.</i>

08:44.169 --> 08:46.940
<i>Ancient man forged coins
inventing money.</i>

08:46.940 --> 08:51.510
<i>Today money is not always gold,
but thankfully gold is always...</i>

08:57.220 --> 08:58.690
Fuck!

09:01.720 --> 09:03.190
- Wow!
- Take it easy, Luke.

09:03.190 --> 09:06.130
- For fuck's sake.
- It's the station man, sorry.

09:07.060 --> 09:08.500
Yeah, hello?

09:08.500 --> 09:11.630
Hey, Rouge, sorry to bother you,
uh, I don't know where Tom is.

09:11.630 --> 09:13.500
- What do you mean?
- I don't know where he is.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.700
- Uh, he's not here.
<i>- Your kidding me.</i>

09:15.710 --> 09:17.570
<i>He's never been
late in eight years.</i>

09:17.840 --> 09:19.570
Um...

09:19.580 --> 09:21.640
Okay, well you're gonna
have to run an old show.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.720
The tape is in the vault,
Rouge and it's locked.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.150
Shit.

09:30.750 --> 09:32.590
Yeah, I got the keys. Um...

09:34.990 --> 09:38.160
You... You're gonna
have to cover the show.

09:39.290 --> 09:40.860
<i>- What?
- Yeah...</i>

09:42.870 --> 09:45.170
Look, we can't go to dead air,
we'll both lose our jobs.

09:45.170 --> 09:48.540
It will just be for a couple of
minutes until Tom gets back. Okay?

09:48.540 --> 09:50.240
I'm not trained for this.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.670
I don't care if you're
a fucking communist.

09:53.680 --> 09:57.980
On the Tom Fleischman show you are a
conservative republican. All right?

09:57.980 --> 10:00.250
<i>Just take a few calls,
let them talk.</i>

10:01.320 --> 10:02.250
Okay.

10:04.790 --> 10:05.820
Hey.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.830
Ethan. Ethan.
I have a problem.

10:10.830 --> 10:12.190
What, what is the problem?

10:12.200 --> 10:14.060
Tom didn't show, Rouge
wants me to cover the shift.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.830
What's the problem?

10:15.830 --> 10:17.470
You know I get tongue...

10:18.970 --> 10:19.930
Tongue tied.

10:19.940 --> 10:21.840
Neil, were your parents mimes?

10:24.170 --> 10:25.910
All right, problem solved.
I'll do it.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.240
I could use the paycheck anyway.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.510
- No, I could use the paycheck.
- Rouge would fire me.

10:29.510 --> 10:30.950
What about Sheila?

10:30.950 --> 10:33.780
Well, Sheila was in a very bad
ice yoga accident.

10:33.780 --> 10:35.750
She shattered her femur.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.120
How can her karma fuck
my karma? That's not fair.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.350
I'm rooting for you, buddy.
Feel good about you.

10:40.360 --> 10:44.560
- Fuck! All right, you do it.
- That's what I thought.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.000
Okay, but you have
to be a republican.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.960
- Piece of cake.
- Totally gonna fuck this up, aren't you?

10:49.970 --> 10:51.930
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, you're gonna get me fired.

10:51.930 --> 10:53.770
- No, am not.
- And arrested probably.

10:53.770 --> 10:56.800
Your gonna say something and it will offend
a whole bunch of people like Donald Trump.

10:56.810 --> 10:59.440
You're out of control.
Let's do this.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.720
<i>Get ready for two hours with the mic

11:09.720 --> 11:12.890
<i>the sage from Seattle,

11:24.670 --> 11:27.570
Top of the morning, folks.
I'm Charles Fern.

11:27.570 --> 11:32.240
Visiting from out of town, missing
my home where my heart is.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.210
And in the world, there is a
lot of things in the world.

11:35.210 --> 11:37.280
A lot of things
in the world are happening.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.410
And lots going on right now.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.050
Uh, and, and...

11:41.050 --> 11:44.190
Actually right now, number one
album in America today, guys,

11:44.190 --> 11:47.190
is none other than gangster
rapper, Ridicule.

11:47.190 --> 11:49.490
And I tell you what,
this album is an outrage.

11:49.490 --> 11:51.060
It is an outrage, all right.

11:51.060 --> 11:55.030
This thing is vulgar, it is
virulent and at times it is vexing.

11:55.030 --> 11:57.600
Let me read you
some of his "poetry."

11:57.600 --> 12:00.470
"N-word what, N-word what,
N-word, please,

12:00.470 --> 12:05.340
I got your p-word in my face
and my d-word up your sleeve."

12:05.340 --> 12:09.540
I tell you what, this is enough.
I'm calling for a boycott.

12:09.550 --> 12:11.310
Enough is enough
over here, folks.

12:11.310 --> 12:13.910
Let's tell these people
what they really need to hear.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.480
Let's send a message over
to Periscope records.

12:16.490 --> 12:18.950
We're not gonna take it,
no, we're not gonna take it.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.920
No, we're not gonna
take it anymore.

12:20.920 --> 12:25.860
My producer Rasputin over here is telling
me that we have some callers calling in.

12:25.860 --> 12:29.430
Uh, Tiffany from Mount Rainer,
state your case please.

12:29.430 --> 12:33.170
<i>Hi. I totally agree with everything
that you are saying, Charles.</i>

12:33.170 --> 12:36.100
My four year old boy called
his sister a "hoe" yesterday.

12:36.110 --> 12:39.540
Whoa, a hoe. Wash that potty
mouth out with Pine Sol.

12:39.540 --> 12:43.880
Yes, well we found out his friends at
school, they are playing that rapper music.

12:43.880 --> 12:48.220
Ah, Tiffany, well it's all part of the
coarsening of the society by if it feels good,

12:48.220 --> 12:51.390
let's mash it up and stuff
it into a syringe and just

12:51.390 --> 12:54.860
stick it right up my urethra
liberal mentality.

12:54.860 --> 12:56.460
I love your boycott idea.

12:56.460 --> 12:59.990
Wow. You know what you are a
wonderful, wonderful Republican MILF.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.430
Mothers of Inspirational
Liberty and Freedom.

13:05.430 --> 13:09.570
You're a fine MILF indeed. Thank you, Tiffany.
Have a wonderful day.

13:09.570 --> 13:12.110
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
our country has been hijacked.

13:12.110 --> 13:14.910
It has been overtaken
and overrun,

13:14.910 --> 13:17.880
but, we will not let them pull the
wool over our eyes anymore, will we?

13:17.880 --> 13:20.820
No, we will not
get fooled again.

13:20.820 --> 13:22.720
But, now a word
from our sponsor.

13:22.720 --> 13:27.020
Glorious way to start your day, a delectable
assortment of Doughglobe donut holes.

13:27.020 --> 13:29.820
Tasty, tasty to stuff
your face-y, face-y.

13:29.830 --> 13:33.590
Take the MO King exit off the five
and it's right there on Hudson.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.000
<i>Tell him Fern sent ya.</i>

13:51.450 --> 13:53.180
Think with the check and that,

13:54.420 --> 13:57.280
you could definitely pitch in.

13:57.690 --> 13:59.190
What?

13:59.190 --> 14:01.760
Are you suggesting that we sell
my grandfather's Martin guitar?

14:01.760 --> 14:03.060
Yeah.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.130
I don't...
Do you know what this is?

14:05.130 --> 14:07.430
I sure do. It's your only asset.

14:07.430 --> 14:12.330
Honey, I am stepping up, you just
gotta give me some more time.

14:12.340 --> 14:15.040
How are you stepping up?
And how much more time?

14:23.310 --> 14:25.880
All right, well I guess we
should be filming right now.

14:26.650 --> 14:29.380
What? You're filming?

14:30.420 --> 14:31.850
Yeah, I'm filming us.

14:31.850 --> 14:32.990
Why are you filming us?

14:32.990 --> 14:34.920
I was filming us
if we're breaking up.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.460
Because it should be on tape.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.990
We're not breaking up?

14:37.990 --> 14:40.530
That's great. Oh, we're gonna film
our breakup now. That's great.

14:40.530 --> 14:44.900
Hey, everybody, hey, Adrienne
wants to film our breakup.

14:44.900 --> 14:48.340
So, we're just gonna... you wanna just
send this to me? Then we'll just post it?

14:48.340 --> 14:50.540
No, we don't have
to call anybody.

14:50.540 --> 14:52.810
We'll just send this and we'll
just post it to everybody.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.210
Then that's how
they'll find out.

14:54.210 --> 14:56.040
They'll find out and send it
to the whole world.

14:56.050 --> 14:58.250
You see that face?
You see that face of an asshole?

14:58.250 --> 15:01.520
Oh, I am the asshole.
I am the asshole.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.920
- Can't bug the system.
- Yeah.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.890
Get a ticket.
Pay the ticket same day.

15:10.890 --> 15:13.030
Save yourself a major headache.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.060
Thanks, man.

15:15.060 --> 15:17.160
You got a week before
it goes to auction.

15:17.170 --> 15:19.600
Then your car becomes my car.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.570
Stupid boot.

15:27.040 --> 15:30.540
Now let's head on over
to the vacuum concession stand.

15:30.550 --> 15:34.150
Where for premium members we're
offering a thousand signed copies

15:34.150 --> 15:36.880
of my first ever children's
book, <i>Who's got your back?</i>

15:36.890 --> 15:39.790
<i>It's available now at
BobBernard.com.</i>

15:39.790 --> 15:43.120
And of course the usual merchandise,
<i>The Vacuum is sealed,</i> t-shirts,

15:43.130 --> 15:45.830
sweatpants and blazers
are only a mouse click away.

15:45.830 --> 15:48.360
All righty folks, that's it
from me, I'm Bob Bernard

15:48.360 --> 15:51.630
and until I see you again,
<i>The Vacuum is Sealed.</i>

15:52.830 --> 15:54.840
Hey. Thanks for letting
me stay here, man.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.570
Yeah, of course.
I'm sorry about that.

15:57.570 --> 15:59.340
Yeah, well lock of shame.

15:59.340 --> 16:02.340
It's a viscous cycle you know. You get the
lock of shame because of unpaid parking

16:02.350 --> 16:04.450
tickets, but then it just creates
more unpaid parking tickets.

16:04.450 --> 16:06.680
Well, everybody knows
the dice are loaded so...

16:07.520 --> 16:09.080
Yeah.

16:09.090 --> 16:11.590
So, what do you wanna do
for your birthday?

16:12.490 --> 16:14.590
I don't know,
probably go cliff diving.

16:14.590 --> 16:16.460
I know a place where
they drain the water.

16:17.930 --> 16:19.460
You know what I mean?

16:19.460 --> 16:21.700
Oh, check this out.
I found this hardcore track by Ridicule.

Hey, Julia.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.100
Oh, hi.

16:56.730 --> 16:57.730
Need a lift?

16:58.800 --> 17:00.230
That's a joke.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.940
Skateboard, joke, yeah.

17:01.940 --> 17:03.140
Right, got it.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.470
Where you headed?

17:05.470 --> 17:08.210
Harborview hospital.
I'm a nurse, you know.

17:08.210 --> 17:09.680
Cause the outfit
didn't give me away.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.380
I gave blood once.

17:11.380 --> 17:14.280
Which is...
I'm not saying that that's...

17:14.280 --> 17:17.079
- Right.
- Comparing to what that is.

17:17.089 --> 17:22.560
Sure, um, so I'm sorry, what do you do anyway?
You're like a voice over person?

17:23.160 --> 17:26.130
No, well, I run a radio show.

17:26.130 --> 17:28.000
Called <i>Ears Wide Shut.</i>

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
- Wait, are you serious?
- Yeah.

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
I love that show. Yes, I've been trying to
figure out where I knew your voice from.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.370
That's crazy, yeah.

17:35.370 --> 17:37.500
Feels terrific to see all
of you out here.

17:37.510 --> 17:40.140
Standing up
to liberal hypocrisy.

17:40.140 --> 17:43.310
Standing up to the bleeding hearts, I
am proud of each and every one of you.

17:43.310 --> 17:45.280
God, that guy is such a dick.

17:45.280 --> 17:49.820
You know, he actually had the audacity to
call my Mom roadkill that just won't die.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.050
Really?

17:51.050 --> 17:52.850
The nastier he gets,
the higher his ratings go.

17:52.860 --> 17:56.260
Why don't you get a few more?
Give them to your kids, get them involved.

17:56.690 --> 17:57.620
That sucks.

17:57.990 --> 17:59.130
Yeah.

18:00.660 --> 18:02.930
I haven't been
in a hospital since birth.

18:04.370 --> 18:05.770
That's...

18:05.770 --> 18:09.770
Um, I don't know do you wanna
come in for a coffee, maybe?

18:09.770 --> 18:12.170
- Sure, yeah.
- I can give you a tour.

18:13.610 --> 18:15.410
It's pretty remarkable how
there are certain films

18:15.410 --> 18:18.350
that actually connect
patients to their past.

18:18.350 --> 18:20.410
That's pretty amazing,
how do you pick the films?

18:20.420 --> 18:24.280
Well, we have thousands of movies
from Westerns to Kabuki theater.

18:24.290 --> 18:28.320
But, the ones that really hold the
audience's interest are the love stories.

18:29.820 --> 18:30.760
Okay.

18:34.130 --> 18:35.630
Keep them shut.

18:35.630 --> 18:38.200
- Okay.
- Okay, open.

18:39.030 --> 18:41.240
No way, a parking permit.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.100
This is amazing,
how did you get this?

18:43.110 --> 18:44.770
I swapped a night shift with
Doctor Carl Murray.

18:44.770 --> 18:47.040
What's the point of having
your BMW if you can't drive it.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.740
This is really thoughtful,
Jefferson.

18:49.750 --> 18:50.880
Thank you.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.550
Oh, yeah this is my friend...

18:53.550 --> 18:55.720
Ah, Jules, I am late for
a corroded artery.

19:00.790 --> 19:03.190
- Nice guy.
- Yeah, he's great.

19:03.190 --> 19:05.490
- Brilliant surgeon.
- Oh...

19:18.810 --> 19:21.810
Yeah, so this is where
I get to go to work everyday.

19:23.210 --> 19:26.580
This is really cool.

19:26.580 --> 19:29.480
Yeah, it's part of this new
program where we're studying

19:29.490 --> 19:31.620
the effects of old films
on Alzheimer's patients.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.620
Amazing. What a novel idea.

19:47.770 --> 19:51.270
<i>♪ Doesn't matter
How hard yo try ♪</i>

19:51.270 --> 19:55.610
Oh, how about "Love is Like Oxygen"
by <i>Sweet.</i>

19:56.310 --> 19:58.610
- Yeah, sure, why not.
- Great.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.450
What about, um...

20:03.790 --> 20:05.490
What about...

20:05.490 --> 20:08.420
"Swept away" from <i>The Very</i>
<i>Best of Yanni.</i>

20:08.420 --> 20:10.120
Sure, yeah, add it on there.

20:10.130 --> 20:12.060
Okay, man, what's going on?

20:12.060 --> 20:13.830
I've tried to get that song
past you before.

20:13.830 --> 20:16.500
Did you get back together
with Adrienne again?

20:16.500 --> 20:19.930
No, no, no. I did meet a pretty
cool girl yesterday, though.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.340
Susan Davis daughter.

20:22.340 --> 20:23.640
- That's interesting.
- Yeah.

20:25.340 --> 20:28.540
Her name is Julia.
She's a nurse at Harborview hospital.

20:29.410 --> 20:30.340
- Admirable.
- Yeah.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.550
Gnarly Neil's hotline.

20:37.050 --> 20:37.990
<i>Hello, Neil?</i>

20:38.650 --> 20:40.320
No, guess again.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.220
- You shitting dog, you can put Neil on.
- Oh.

20:43.230 --> 20:46.260
He's pissy, man.
It's Rouge.

20:46.260 --> 20:48.330
<i>- Hey, Rouge.
- Hey, Neil.</i>

20:49.060 --> 20:51.670
So, Tom had a massive stroke.

20:51.670 --> 20:53.970
<i>He can't even move his lips.</i>

20:53.970 --> 20:55.840
<i>- No way.
- Way.</i>

20:56.900 --> 21:00.510
Poor guy. So, uh...

21:00.510 --> 21:04.880
All channel is coming down tomorrow and I'm
not gonna make it back till nightfall.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.910
All channel is coming to the
station tomorrow?

21:07.920 --> 21:12.950
Peter Dennon and company.
Big decisions have to be made. And, um...

21:12.960 --> 21:17.020
Really good job covering.
We got some really good feedback.

21:17.030 --> 21:20.830
Yeah, it wasn't me.
It was a guest from next door.

21:20.830 --> 21:24.000
- What?
<i>- Some conservative guy visiting.</i>

21:24.530 --> 21:25.630
Oh...

21:25.630 --> 21:28.140
Okay, he can cover tomorrow,
right, we're paying.

21:28.140 --> 21:29.440
<i>I don't think so.</i>

21:29.440 --> 21:33.410
I think he went back
to his home.

21:33.410 --> 21:35.610
No, dude, come on,
I could use the money.

21:36.340 --> 21:38.250
Do it. What are you doing?

21:38.250 --> 21:41.380
Okay, I think I can get him for tomorrow
but after that he leaves forever.

21:41.380 --> 21:45.490
Good, good, and remember we
got the Ann Alcott interview.

21:46.050 --> 21:46.990
Shit.

22:15.580 --> 22:18.390
Wow, wow, that was...

22:18.390 --> 22:20.150
Jeez, that was fantastic, wow.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.860
Thank you so much. Happy birthday to us, right?
Happy birthday, Seattle.

22:25.190 --> 22:28.060
That's <i>Ears Wide Shut,</i> 87.9.

22:28.060 --> 22:29.330
We gotta go.

22:29.330 --> 22:31.260
You got everything?
What is this? This is great.

22:31.270 --> 22:32.430
We're gonna do this.

22:32.430 --> 22:34.870
- They're Dockers?
- They don't wrinkle.

22:36.370 --> 22:37.840
They don't zip?

22:37.840 --> 22:40.010
Proper. I pop. I pop.

22:40.010 --> 22:42.040
Well, you look like one of them.

22:47.180 --> 22:48.150
I know.

22:49.020 --> 22:50.550
What are you talking about?

22:51.690 --> 22:54.290
Hey, Mary Sue. Hi, how are you?

22:54.290 --> 22:56.320
What have we got going on here?

22:56.330 --> 22:57.460
It's performance art.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.460
Yeah, this is a character
for our show.

22:59.460 --> 23:02.530
This is your Lois Lane moment where you
get to be sworn together in secrecy.

23:02.530 --> 23:06.730
Well, I love the fact that there are
true performers in this building.

23:06.740 --> 23:08.240
I won't your be
your Kryptonite.

23:08.240 --> 23:11.070
- Okay.
- Oh, oh, happy birthday.

23:11.070 --> 23:13.010
It's Scott Brooke's greatest
hits on vinyl.

23:13.010 --> 23:14.570
I gotta get the tapes,
I'll meet you in there.

23:14.580 --> 23:16.810
He's gotta get the tapes,
so, we'll meet you.

23:16.810 --> 23:19.150
So, tell me Charles,
where you from?

23:19.150 --> 23:23.880
Great question, actually it's
upstate Maine, in the,

23:23.890 --> 23:26.790
the Maine region, it's a
part of the Maine area.

23:26.790 --> 23:29.690
I didn't realize Maine was big
enough to have an upstate.

23:31.130 --> 23:33.460
Well, it's upstate enough to
know we're not Canadians, Peter.

23:33.460 --> 23:35.760
You know what I'm saying?

23:35.760 --> 23:37.730
He got it, he got it,
he figured it out.

23:37.730 --> 23:40.630
Oh, look it's our tardy
producer, Rasputin.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.070
Rasputin say hello to Peter
and Ryan from All channel.

23:43.070 --> 23:45.070
- Nice to meet you.
- Ryan.

23:45.070 --> 23:46.610
I'm sorry, we gotta start.

23:46.940 --> 23:47.870
I'm sorry.

23:49.440 --> 23:50.780
Well, good luck to you,
young man.

23:50.780 --> 23:52.980
- Sure.
- Show me your magic.

23:52.980 --> 23:54.310
I'll be up here listening.

23:54.320 --> 23:56.450
- Great, thanks Peter.
- You got it.

23:56.450 --> 23:57.580
All right.

23:59.090 --> 24:01.820

24:20.440 --> 24:22.780
get down off the five
on Hudson.

24:22.780 --> 24:26.650
It's called Doughglobes, folks,
tell them Fern sent ya.

24:26.650 --> 24:31.320
Magnifico, anyway with us in the second
segment is renowned commentator Ann Alcott.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.790
But first, some election news.

24:33.790 --> 24:36.220
Wow, and I tell you what
the papers are hot today.

24:36.230 --> 24:39.390
Today's <i>Seattle Post</i> has governor
Sollow up by six points.

24:39.390 --> 24:41.600
But, this is not good
news for the governor.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.100
This left leading Kool Aid
drinking whore-mongers,

24:44.100 --> 24:47.670
marshaled their forces again
and what say you Seattle?

24:47.670 --> 24:49.770
Let's take a call here and discuss.
We have a caller here.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.510
Rasputin, is there
someone on the line?

24:52.470 --> 24:53.970
Do you wanna speak
into the microphone?

24:53.980 --> 24:56.780
The folks at home think
you are some kind of a ghost.

24:58.450 --> 25:01.050
The phone lines
are all blinking, Sir Charles.

25:01.050 --> 25:04.550
Caller state your case and
make it snappy, krackerjackie.

25:04.550 --> 25:11.490
Yeah, I'm Ron and I just, I really wanna
say that I really like Susan Davis.

25:11.490 --> 25:16.360
Oh, yeah, isn't she wonderful?
Wow. Yeah, she is kind of likable.

25:16.370 --> 25:20.970
If you're smoking a three foot
bronze bong, you mangy hippie.

25:21.870 --> 25:23.100
I resent that.

25:23.110 --> 25:24.470
Well, you resemble it, Ron.

25:24.470 --> 25:26.870
You're just another yellow belly,
taxes spending, cut and run

25:26.880 --> 25:28.110
toking, smoking,

25:28.110 --> 25:31.240
midnight coking, porn making
liberal is what you are.

25:31.250 --> 25:34.450
I don't make porn.
I watch it.

25:34.450 --> 25:37.780
Well, schlemiel schlimazel, Ron, you
can't hate the sin and love the sinner,

25:37.790 --> 25:39.420
can we baby,
that's masturabitorial,

25:39.420 --> 25:40.750
self-aggrandizement that
you lefties

25:40.760 --> 25:42.560
love to wax on about.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.460
Let's have a moment
of honesty here, Ron.

25:44.460 --> 25:48.460
All your huffing and puffing has caught
up with you, you are in a perpetual

25:48.460 --> 25:50.400
John Holm sized hangover,

25:50.400 --> 25:54.270
you've got your gerbaise of the dark
side of your Luna, <i>comprehende?</i>

25:56.000 --> 25:56.900
That's not fair.

25:56.910 --> 25:58.640
Oh, it's not fair, Ron?
Is it not fair?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.540
Well, listen you are a
trembling, simpering puss puss.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.140
Well, woof-woof, prune juice.

26:03.150 --> 26:07.010
It's time to take a cold dark look
at the mouse in the mirror, baby.

26:13.520 --> 26:16.060
Is that a cry?
Are you crying?

26:16.060 --> 26:19.090
Is he crying? Are you a
baby man crying, Ronnie?

26:19.090 --> 26:20.590
Are you crying, Ronnie?

26:20.600 --> 26:22.530
<i>Do we have any Kleenex for
Ron, guys?</i>

26:22.530 --> 26:24.230
Can we get a runner out?

26:24.230 --> 26:27.400
Rasputin, do you wanna send a
runner out to get some Kleenex?

26:28.970 --> 26:32.140
You want a little pillow?
You want a little blanket, Ron?

26:33.240 --> 26:34.870
Yeah, you're right.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.810
My life is a fucking mess.

26:39.180 --> 26:40.680
I split with my wife.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.180
The bank will
foreclose my house.

26:50.790 --> 26:52.330
Well, Ron, I'll tell you what.

26:52.960 --> 26:55.160
You have just been fernatized.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.630
You have been fernatized, Ron.

27:00.000 --> 27:06.670
<i>Yes, Ron, take a deep breath and smell the
fresh chlorine scented Republican air.</i>

27:09.640 --> 27:13.250
We're talking about Ann Alcott's
new book A Brief History of Liars

27:13.250 --> 27:14.510
<i>From Hitler to Hilary.</i>

27:14.520 --> 27:16.650
I mean in a word,
amazing balls.

27:16.650 --> 27:20.620
I'm glad you liked it. Eleventh week
as New York Times bestseller list.

27:20.620 --> 27:22.220
Your such a wunderbar writer.

27:22.220 --> 27:24.490
I mean your pros so turgid,
your arguments so cleft.

27:24.490 --> 27:26.690
And with a Francophile
sense of language,

27:26.700 --> 27:29.960
coupled with a healthy disdain for French
culture and their people in general.

27:29.970 --> 27:33.030
I mean this is just,
this is wonderful.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.940
I should have had you write
my back cover, Charles.

27:35.940 --> 27:38.740
Well, I'll be your back door
man anytime, Ann.

27:39.910 --> 27:42.540
Such a lovely American.
You're great.

27:42.540 --> 27:46.280
And, to my listeners, listen I
am so touched by your support.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.620
Grateful for your perspicacity.

27:48.620 --> 27:51.380
I'm Charles Fern, ferning off.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.920
You have something
really special here, Peter.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.160
I think you are right, Ann.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.590
You did a pretty good job,
today, Charles.

28:00.600 --> 28:04.400
Oh, well, don't josher
josher, Peter Piper.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.870
I have never known Peter
to josh, Fern.

28:06.870 --> 28:08.970
You are a real talent.

28:08.970 --> 28:10.800
Gosh, well, thank you,
that's very touching.

28:10.810 --> 28:14.040
- That's lovely.
- Tell us, Mr. Fern.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.210
- What are your future plans?
- My plans are plains.

28:17.210 --> 28:20.280
I unfortunately have to swish
on back to Maine tomorrow.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.250
Hmm...

28:22.250 --> 28:26.420
Well, I have a better idea.
Why don't we all go to dinner?

28:26.420 --> 28:31.320
Yes, we can't let Charles swish
back to Maine without dinner.

28:32.130 --> 28:33.960
Well...

28:33.960 --> 28:36.800
- I do like to nibble.
- All right, it's settled.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.900
And, I know just the spot.

28:45.070 --> 28:47.640
- Hello?
- Hey, Neil, what's up? How are you?

28:47.640 --> 28:49.840
Oh, hey Adrienne, uh...

28:49.850 --> 28:51.640
<i>Hey, can you
put Ethan on, please?</i>

28:51.650 --> 28:53.580
Yeah, Ethan is not here.

28:53.580 --> 28:58.120
Don't be a spineless, cowardly liar
like your roommate, put him on, please?

29:03.920 --> 29:07.290
- Hi, Adrienne.
- I just wanted to see what you were doing for your birthday.

29:07.300 --> 29:09.800
Oh, well I'm actually gonna be
playing my air guitar now cause

29:09.800 --> 29:11.630
my real guitar was stolen.

29:11.630 --> 29:15.370
I have your guitar because it was collateral
for promises that you made to me.

29:15.370 --> 29:19.570
Why don't you come by tomorrow and give
me my guitar back as my birthday present?

29:19.570 --> 29:20.810
<i>How about that?</i>

29:20.810 --> 29:23.440
Yeah, well, happy
birthday to you.

29:24.910 --> 29:27.010
You can turn your phone
back on.

29:30.990 --> 29:32.850
So, we've been talking.

29:32.850 --> 29:38.320
And we've decided that we're gonna make
the Tom Fleischman show, your show.

29:38.330 --> 29:42.830
Now, think about this.
The Charles Fern show.

29:42.830 --> 29:46.200
To be heard all over
the state of Washington.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.140
Wow, well, what an honor,
Mr. Peter, thank you.

29:49.140 --> 29:52.040
And yes, it is an honor
because if you do well here,

29:52.040 --> 29:53.910
we're gonna take you national.

29:53.910 --> 29:56.180
Wow, that's really tempting.

29:56.180 --> 29:57.780
But, I've gotta, like I said,

29:57.780 --> 30:01.080
I've gotta head home, my pine
tree farm is ripe for syruping.

30:01.080 --> 30:04.250
- But, I am really excited about...
- Charlie, Charlie...

30:04.250 --> 30:07.850
You're gonna be able to buy
all the Aunt Jemima you want.

30:07.860 --> 30:10.060
Yes, and that's just
pancake batter.

30:10.060 --> 30:15.200
If we take you national, you're gonna
get a starting bonus of six figures.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.400
And get to re-negotiate
your salary.

30:17.400 --> 30:18.500
How does that sound, huh?

30:18.500 --> 30:19.830
Well?

30:19.840 --> 30:23.870
Well, I guess, that's,
that's, that is...

30:23.870 --> 30:26.870
That is an offer that
Charles Fern cannot refuse.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.580
Okay, that sounds...

30:28.580 --> 30:30.610
Looks like everyone is here
and table is ready guys.

30:30.610 --> 30:31.640
- Okay.
- Charles...

30:31.650 --> 30:33.550
Welcome to the All
channel family.

30:33.550 --> 30:35.350
Okay.

30:35.350 --> 30:38.280
Ann tells me your quite the talent,
Charles, so where are you from in Maine?

30:38.290 --> 30:42.020
Oh, well, about a 100 miles
north of the Canadian border.

30:42.020 --> 30:44.790
- North?
- South of our side.

30:44.790 --> 30:47.190
Little bit of heaven from
your home state, huh?

30:47.200 --> 30:50.800
Well, I have been craving a nice
piece of tail, Peter.

30:50.800 --> 30:56.340
Well, I'm an Iowian and like a Mainer, we
know what a hard day's work consists of.

30:56.340 --> 31:01.010
Unlike Susan Davis, who wants
to give needles to the junkies.

31:01.010 --> 31:03.880
And subsidize
drug rehabilitation.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.080
Well, I think they should
buy their own drugs.

31:07.350 --> 31:10.780
Could I have a Shirley temple
with some Jack Daniels in there?

31:10.790 --> 31:11.750
Coming right up.

31:11.750 --> 31:13.120
I'm getting us some olive oil.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.420
Olive oil, are you serious,
madam?

31:15.420 --> 31:18.420
It's my wife's first time.
She's a stylist.

31:18.430 --> 31:21.060
We'll let it pass.
We'll let it pass.

31:21.060 --> 31:24.400
I'm the reason why Ryan
looks so well put together.

31:25.370 --> 31:32.440
So, Charles, can you show me how
a native would eat this bird.

31:32.440 --> 31:34.510
Right, well that's...

31:35.410 --> 31:39.410
We have our customs
and where I come from,

31:39.410 --> 31:43.280
it's very customary to use your
hand, so you just, you pick her up.

31:50.990 --> 31:54.690
I guess this is how
we get to know each other.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.230
- Indeed.
- Young man.

31:56.230 --> 31:59.000
We have a little surprise
for you.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.600
You get to interview
the great governor.

32:02.600 --> 32:05.470
That's splendid.
Splendid indeed.

32:05.470 --> 32:06.610
Indeed.

32:10.540 --> 32:11.480
Ooh...

32:45.350 --> 32:47.480
Surprise!

32:51.520 --> 32:53.420
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!

32:53.420 --> 32:54.350
Happy birthday!

32:55.920 --> 32:59.490
I didn't have anything to do with that.
All right, see you guys.

33:00.530 --> 33:02.300
Woo.
Hey, guys.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.730
Oh, my gosh. Look at how
pregnant you are.

33:04.730 --> 33:06.300
I know, I'm huge.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.670
Trevor was telling me about the
misadventures of lamaze class.

33:09.670 --> 33:14.410
So, Trevor and I are the only ones in
the group that can't breathe in unison.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.980
Well, I mean here is your free
education right here.

33:16.980 --> 33:18.580
Julia is a nurse
and Jefferson is a doctor.

33:18.580 --> 33:19.980
Cardiothoracic surgeon.

33:19.980 --> 33:22.620
Nice to meet you both. And I deal
with heavy breathing all the time.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.220
You do?

33:25.220 --> 33:27.590
Cool. How do you guys all
know each other?

33:27.590 --> 33:31.520
Well, Ethan was actually hired
by my mother to do a voice over.

33:31.530 --> 33:33.230
Oh, who is your mother?

33:33.230 --> 33:35.190
She is, um, Susan Davies.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.700
- Our next governor.
- I am totally voting for your mom.

33:37.700 --> 33:41.270
You know if you need
any volunteers? Let me know.

33:41.270 --> 33:44.340
I was also actually thinking
about volunteering.

33:44.340 --> 33:47.410
That would be great. We can
use all the help we can get.

33:47.410 --> 33:48.640
So, thank you Ethan.

33:48.640 --> 33:52.580
I was actually born
on the Gram Parsons tour bus.

33:52.580 --> 33:55.950
Wow, your mom must have been
a big Gram Parsons fan.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.750
Yeah, you could say so.

33:57.750 --> 33:59.320
Your show is it on AM or FM?

33:59.320 --> 34:02.620
Uh, FM. 87.9 Seattle's finest.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.190
Yeah.

34:04.190 --> 34:06.330
Way down on the left
side of the dial.

34:06.330 --> 34:08.630
- Yeah.
- It's hard to get in.

34:08.630 --> 34:11.330
It's hard to get in when you
have a small tiny receiver.

34:13.699 --> 34:18.000
In my next life when I am not saving
lives, I am gonna be a rock and roll DJ.

34:19.710 --> 34:20.670
- Cool.
- Great.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.179
Good luck.

34:24.110 --> 34:25.239
Talk to you in a second.

34:30.780 --> 34:31.719
Neil.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.389
- Its Jack with honor.
- Rouge?

34:36.560 --> 34:38.260
Hey, what, are you
having a party?

34:38.260 --> 34:39.030
Yeah.

34:39.030 --> 34:41.130
- Birthday?
- Yeah.

34:41.130 --> 34:43.530
Did you bring me some antlers
fresh from the kill?

34:44.260 --> 34:45.969
Them antlers is mine.

34:45.969 --> 34:47.070
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

34:47.070 --> 34:49.770
Well, hey, now you
got something to mount.

34:54.210 --> 34:55.340
Neil, we need to talk.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.510
What do you need to talk
to Neil about?

35:00.050 --> 35:02.320
Holy shit. What is this?
A Turkish drug den?

35:02.320 --> 35:03.520
Who put a stick up his ass?

35:03.520 --> 35:06.320
Cindy, Steve,
let's take this outside.

35:06.990 --> 35:08.650
- You all right, buddy?
- Yeah.

35:08.660 --> 35:12.230
This is exactly how an innocent
marine fails a piss test.

35:13.630 --> 35:14.560
Neil...

35:16.030 --> 35:18.430
I got another call
from All channel.

35:22.300 --> 35:23.870
About this Charles Fern.

35:24.570 --> 35:25.970
Really?

35:25.970 --> 35:28.770
Yeah, they said he's the new voice
of conservative talk radio.

35:30.940 --> 35:32.380
Who is this guy?

35:32.380 --> 35:34.380
Yeah, Neil where did you find
the Michael Jordan of chitchat?

35:34.380 --> 35:36.450
He was a guest next door,
I don't know his life story.

35:36.450 --> 35:38.520
Really? What's his number?

35:38.520 --> 35:42.160
Well, you know, unfortunately
Rouge, he's gone.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.990
He went back to Maine.

35:43.990 --> 35:46.590
Ryan Pollard said that
they just hired him.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.030
Really?

35:48.030 --> 35:51.430
Mr. Holmes. Charles Fern
at your service.

35:51.430 --> 35:53.430
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

35:56.170 --> 35:58.400
- Howdy-doody.
- How do I look?

36:01.140 --> 36:02.280
Wait a minute.

36:02.980 --> 36:04.740
Tuna jerky here
is not Charles Fern.

36:04.750 --> 36:07.050
You've just been fernatized.

36:08.820 --> 36:10.180
Is this some kind of hoax?

36:10.190 --> 36:12.520
You're not gonna keep
doing Tom's show.

36:12.520 --> 36:15.350
What do you mean? It's not a
show anymore, it's my show now.

36:15.360 --> 36:17.160
You're not even from Maine.

36:17.160 --> 36:19.630
Well, I attended a pottery
camp there one summer.

36:19.630 --> 36:23.500
No, I'm not gonna just stand here, while
you fool everybody, while Tom lays

36:23.500 --> 36:25.300
paralyzed in a hospital bed.

36:25.300 --> 36:26.470
Suit yourself, Crisco,

36:26.470 --> 36:28.830
but Charles Fern
is a tribute to Tom, you know?

36:28.840 --> 36:31.200
I'm elevating his message
to a higher level.

36:31.210 --> 36:33.340
But, your not a conservative
on any level.

36:34.140 --> 36:35.740
The new voice
of the right, right?

36:35.740 --> 36:39.810
So, if you want to keep your job,
you better get with the program.

36:39.810 --> 36:43.250
If you try to get me fired,
we all get fired.

36:43.250 --> 36:45.150
No, this can't be happening.
This is a bad dream.

36:45.150 --> 36:48.960
Oh, man, that would be weird, if
we were all having the same dream.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.860
- Who goes there?
- Hey, it's Julia.

36:51.860 --> 36:53.690
I'm looking for Ethan.

36:57.230 --> 36:58.460
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:58.470 --> 37:00.000
- What's going on?
- Nice jacket.

37:00.000 --> 37:03.300
Oh...
Sorry, we were just...

37:03.300 --> 37:04.870
We were just catching up.

37:04.870 --> 37:08.980
Jefferson got a page and had to
go back to the hospital, so...

37:10.040 --> 37:11.640
Yeah, I might take off
in a minute.

37:11.650 --> 37:14.310
Can you just stay for a little bit?
Just stay for a little bit, come on?

37:14.320 --> 37:17.220
I'll get you home by
midnight, I promise.

37:17.220 --> 37:19.050
Yeah, I guess I could stay
a little longer.

37:19.050 --> 37:21.150
Okay, I'll be right out.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.890
- Okay.
- Promise. I'll see you soon.

37:28.130 --> 37:29.400
The nut is in your sack.

37:33.230 --> 37:35.430
Got my daughter's student
loans to pay back.

37:35.440 --> 37:37.540
The house is upside down.

37:39.370 --> 37:40.770
What do you say, Rouge?

37:43.940 --> 37:45.680
I guess the show must go on.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.450
There you go. Right on, Reagan.
Come on, baby.

37:48.450 --> 37:50.620
Let's get you a drink
and celebrate, huh?

37:52.220 --> 37:54.050
Hey, I could use another drink.

37:54.960 --> 37:56.360
Let's get him a drink.

38:14.510 --> 38:16.880
It's really good to be home.

38:16.880 --> 38:19.250
Yeah, sometimes I forget
how good we have it here.

38:19.250 --> 38:21.480
Yeah, sometimes I think
we have it too good.

38:22.180 --> 38:24.420
What does that mean?

38:24.420 --> 38:26.850
You know all the sacrifices
we make to...

38:27.690 --> 38:29.890
Get the things we think
we deserve,

38:30.960 --> 38:32.730
you know, it's kind of
like that old commercial,

38:32.730 --> 38:34.790
what would you do for
a Klondike bar?

38:34.800 --> 38:37.100
Yeah.

38:37.100 --> 38:39.300
A Klondike bar.

38:39.300 --> 38:41.370
Yeah, I kind of got some
bad news today though.

38:41.370 --> 38:44.200
Really? What happened?

38:44.210 --> 38:47.540
The hospital decided to cut the
funding for the Alzheimer's theater.

38:48.210 --> 38:50.540
Really? Why?

38:50.550 --> 38:53.410
They decided to build a hair
restoration clinic.

38:54.580 --> 38:55.920
Mmm...

38:55.920 --> 38:57.480
Thick hair for thick people.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.750
Pretty much.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.990
I'm gonna ask my mom
for some help but,

39:01.990 --> 39:04.120
they're gonna transfer
me to the pediatric ward.

39:05.630 --> 39:07.530
That's really a shame.

39:08.130 --> 39:09.060
It is.

39:11.630 --> 39:13.970
Don't you have a girlfriend?

39:15.470 --> 39:17.900
No. That's all over now.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.440
I'm still not gonna
kiss you tonight.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.910
Well, it's my birthday.
I mean...

39:27.650 --> 39:32.590
But, that would mean everything we
just talked about was small talk.

39:32.590 --> 39:34.720
And, I don't really like the
way that makes me feel.

39:35.660 --> 39:38.390
Well, we can kiss and talk
at the same time.

39:38.390 --> 39:40.530
Stop your slobbering.

39:40.530 --> 39:43.130
I'm just trying to kill
two birds with one stone.

39:45.800 --> 39:46.930
Not tonight.

39:49.470 --> 39:52.000
- But, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

39:53.270 --> 39:56.240
My car is just
right there, so...

39:56.240 --> 39:58.180
- I'm gonna take off.
- Okay.

40:00.750 --> 40:01.910
Be safe.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.580
- Goodnight, Ethan.
- Goodnight.

40:09.220 --> 40:10.890
We'll haul a Tribune.

40:12.490 --> 40:14.190
There you are.

40:14.200 --> 40:15.730
We'll get you right in.

40:15.730 --> 40:18.500
That takes care of both of us, right?
See what did I tell you?

40:18.500 --> 40:19.970
Okay, I just...

40:19.970 --> 40:21.130
I always look out for you.

40:21.140 --> 40:23.570
- Because remember in January...
- That was one time.

40:23.570 --> 40:25.870
Yeah, but I got left outside.

40:25.870 --> 40:28.170
I'm just trying to make
it really nice.

40:30.040 --> 40:33.050
That's just not gonna work for us today, okay.
We're gonna have to push.

40:33.050 --> 40:34.180
Tell him I'll call him back.

40:35.280 --> 40:37.050
Ready? We got a tight
day ahead of us.

40:37.050 --> 40:38.480
Oh, yeah, absolutely ready.

40:39.590 --> 40:41.450
The Charles Fern show.

40:41.460 --> 40:43.460
All channel. ALL.

40:43.460 --> 40:45.590
Yup, I got you right here.

40:45.590 --> 40:48.690
- Okay, that should be that.
- You ever been fernatized?

40:48.700 --> 40:53.600
If you don't mind I wanted to show you
some images and get some impressions.

40:53.600 --> 40:57.440
So, basically right here
we have Michael Ray Vallus.

40:57.440 --> 41:00.970
It's a seven year old boy
who found his dad's gun

41:00.980 --> 41:04.710
in the spring after you vetoed
the mandatory child locks.

41:07.410 --> 41:10.050
That is indeed a tragedy.

41:10.050 --> 41:11.920
Well, of course it is.

41:11.920 --> 41:15.150
I don't suppose this
is a sneak attack.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.460
And you probably don't
write for the Trib.

41:17.460 --> 41:19.690
That's it, interview
is over, come on.

41:19.690 --> 41:21.560
No, wait, you have nothing
to say about that.

41:21.560 --> 41:25.900
Sure, I do, if you wanna have an intelligent
conversation about gun laws, yeah.

41:26.130 --> 41:27.070
Okay.

41:28.900 --> 41:32.070
I did want to give you this,
this is from his mother.

41:32.070 --> 41:35.240
This is the hat that he
wore when he shot himself.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.110
And she actually wanted
you to have it.

41:37.110 --> 41:38.840
- Here you go.
- Okay.

41:38.850 --> 41:42.310
That's enough. Enough, enough.
Come on.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.980
You too, let's go.
Come on.

41:45.390 --> 41:46.850
We'll just come back.

41:50.920 --> 41:54.290
Have a nice day.
I'm sure, we'll be welcome.

41:55.260 --> 41:56.200
Sorry about that.

41:58.200 --> 42:01.830
Next interview is here. It's a
talk show host. Charles Fern.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.740
All right we're live in five,
four, three, two, one.

42:04.740 --> 42:07.070
<i>Get ready for two hours with
the mic from the right,</i>

42:07.070 --> 42:09.380
<i>the messenger from Maine,
Mr. Charles Fern.</i>

42:09.380 --> 42:12.850
And this is the
Charles Fern show.

42:12.850 --> 42:15.010
We're here live at the
governor's mansion

42:15.020 --> 42:17.880
with governor Sollow himself,
governor what a blast.

42:17.890 --> 42:20.350
So, good to have you here
Charles, I'm a huge fan.

42:20.350 --> 42:24.260
How do we get our country back to those
foundation republican principles?

42:24.260 --> 42:28.090
I'm talking pre-maternity
leave, pre-bra burning.

42:28.100 --> 42:30.960
You know the people know what they
know, Charles, and once you get

42:30.970 --> 42:34.730
outside of those coffee houses of
Seattle I think you'll find most

42:34.740 --> 42:39.440
of the people share our view for a
compassionate, conservative, Washington state.

42:39.440 --> 42:42.540
A lot of whore houses are going on
inside of coffee shops these days.

42:42.540 --> 42:45.480
- It's gotten out of hand.
- Another question?

42:45.480 --> 42:50.680
The next question also Governor now I'm
gonna go right into a hard question here.

42:50.690 --> 42:53.050
Are there any republican bands
that do not suck?

42:54.420 --> 42:55.990
What do you mean?

42:55.990 --> 42:59.360
The left has Radiohead, it's got
Elton John, you got Neil Young.

42:59.360 --> 43:04.560
And in the right, we're talking what,
Toby Keith and Ted Nugent.

43:04.570 --> 43:07.400
We're really getting crushed
here in the creative trenches.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.300
- I see.. I get your point.
- Yeah.

43:09.300 --> 43:13.440
I don't know, we don't have an answer for that.
But, we do need a theme song.

43:13.440 --> 43:14.970
You know Susan Davis already
has one.

43:14.980 --> 43:17.380
"Looks like we made it",
Barry Manilow.

43:17.380 --> 43:19.650
That's a Manilow hanging fruit.

43:20.710 --> 43:23.050
Well, you got any suggestions?

43:23.050 --> 43:28.290
Yeah, have you heard of an old goth
rock band called Cat Rapes Dog?

43:29.760 --> 43:31.860
Well, a bit too obscure.

43:31.860 --> 43:34.630
What about Pink Houses
by John Mellencamp?

43:34.630 --> 43:35.760
That's a good song.

43:36.360 --> 43:37.700
That's subtle.

43:37.700 --> 43:39.670
Isn't Mellencamp a democrat?

43:39.670 --> 43:44.500
No, Mellencamp is more
of a independent.

43:44.510 --> 43:47.240
When is the tour?
Are we gonna have a tour?

43:47.240 --> 43:50.210
An official...
well?

43:50.210 --> 43:53.250
I'll tell you what, we'll do better than that.
We'll take you hunting.

43:58.220 --> 44:02.620
All right, it's a beautiful day,
we got 500 acres to roll, and...

44:02.620 --> 44:04.290
You boys are gonna catch lunch.

44:05.360 --> 44:08.290
- You bag her in Africa?
- Oh, no.

44:08.300 --> 44:09.830
That was in Vegas.

44:11.100 --> 44:12.830
Vegas?

44:12.830 --> 44:15.300
- During one of the shows?
- Oh, please. After.

44:24.510 --> 44:26.250
First shot of the season.

44:27.110 --> 44:29.720
- It's a custom in Maine.
- Yeah, reload.

44:29.720 --> 44:31.950
- I wanna see that again.
- Thank you.

44:36.790 --> 44:42.160
Charles is more of a semi-automatic kind of guy.
Precision tactical.

44:44.400 --> 44:47.630
They never look like James Bond
They always look like this guy.

44:47.640 --> 44:49.770
- Don't they?
- Exactly.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.670
You know I grew up in Maine.

44:51.670 --> 44:53.910
- Did you?
- Yeah.

44:53.910 --> 44:56.140
Out there we hunt
moose with a machine gun.

44:56.140 --> 44:59.310
Well, that doesn't sound very sporting.
Does it, Charles?

45:00.480 --> 45:03.050
Well, in Maine, you know
it's...

45:04.150 --> 45:06.950
It's overrun right now
with moose.

45:06.950 --> 45:09.520
But, you just get out
there and you go...

45:09.520 --> 45:12.020
They got a whole flock.

45:13.060 --> 45:14.830
- Good times?
- It's good times, yeah.

45:14.830 --> 45:19.700
It sure is,
you know governor...

45:19.700 --> 45:24.870
I'm getting over this, it's a bout of
this bird flu, actually which has been

45:24.870 --> 45:27.110
it is just plaguing
the land in Maine right now.

45:27.110 --> 45:30.810
It's really wild, but I would,
I don't know if hunting

45:30.810 --> 45:33.810
pheasant is really
in the doctor's orders.

45:33.810 --> 45:36.180
Mmm-hmm. You rest your voice.

45:36.180 --> 45:38.980
I'm gonna need you,
top shape for this election.

45:41.820 --> 45:44.290
- Thank you governor.
- Thank you governor.

45:45.590 --> 45:46.530
For your time.

45:49.460 --> 45:53.400
<i>And now a word from our sponsor,

Okay, we have our
winners in the studio.

46:34.980 --> 46:39.380
Now what do you say to three tickets to
country town radio's hometown hoedown.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.250
We love the hoedown.

46:41.250 --> 46:43.220
The hoedown is awesome.

46:44.620 --> 46:46.620
So, who's he?

46:46.620 --> 46:49.290
That guy?
He invented the donut hole.

46:49.290 --> 46:54.460
What do you say we throw in two dozen
of these Doughglobes with your tickets?

46:54.460 --> 46:55.990
- Yummy.
- Thank you.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.730
- Your welcome.
- Make sure you share with Daddy.

46:58.730 --> 47:00.370
I will.

47:00.370 --> 47:03.740
I tell ya it's not the right to bare
feet, or, to bare naked ladies,

47:03.740 --> 47:05.140
it's the right to bear arms.

47:05.140 --> 47:07.410
Our founding fathers
were packing heat.

47:07.410 --> 47:10.080
It should be illegal not
to own a gun, don't you think?

47:10.080 --> 47:12.850
You gotta dig
the founding wigs.

47:12.850 --> 47:17.650
I'm curious to know what do you think about
building a fence along our border, Charles?

47:17.650 --> 47:22.190
Terrific idea. I'm also proposing a
reptilian moat with steeples and turrets.

47:22.190 --> 47:24.590
There is nothing like staring down
the barrel of a canon to keep

47:24.590 --> 47:27.430
the huddled masses huddled,
are you with me Jennifer?

47:27.430 --> 47:31.260
You are using your air time
to whip up xenophobia.

47:31.270 --> 47:35.370
Well, most of our listeners are two
syllable crowd, okay, calm it down.

47:35.370 --> 47:38.070
Most of your listeners
are small minded bigots.

47:38.070 --> 47:40.440
And, you are their leader.
It's shameful.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.040
I can't defend everyone
who listens to the show,

47:42.040 --> 47:44.010
that would require
me to be omnipotent.

47:44.010 --> 47:46.510
Which you a likely atheist
would not understand.

47:46.510 --> 47:49.750
And yes, probably the AM crowd has a
couple of borderline personality types

47:49.750 --> 47:53.120
sitting alone in a dark house eating TV
dinners for breakfast every morning.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.550
And that would make anyone a
little paranoid, don't you think?

47:55.560 --> 47:58.060
I tell you what, if they are a
gun owner, all bets are off.

47:58.060 --> 48:02.290
But, if you think I'm gonna let you sit
here and attack my maladjusted listeners

48:02.300 --> 48:05.360
you are sorely mistaken.

48:05.370 --> 48:07.200
Thank you for the call.

48:07.200 --> 48:09.570
<i>And now a little
sponsorship talk.</i>

48:09.570 --> 48:12.740
<i>I'm talking about a little
place called Doughglobes.</i>

48:12.740 --> 48:17.540
Charles, I just got off the phone with
Peter Dennon and All channel loves you.

48:17.540 --> 48:19.240
All you need is love, Ryan.

48:19.250 --> 48:22.710
- Charles Fern.
- Whose asking?

48:22.720 --> 48:25.950
We're his official MILF
fan club.

48:25.950 --> 48:27.620
We've been fernitized.

48:28.250 --> 48:29.920
I need a selfie.

48:30.860 --> 48:34.190
Well, okay, yeah,
get in there, okay.

48:34.190 --> 48:37.760
Thank you for listening. It's
lovely to see such lovely fans.

48:37.770 --> 48:39.200
Thank you, thank you.

48:39.200 --> 48:41.800
- Oh, that's good.
- Bye bye now.

48:41.800 --> 48:44.070
All right, thank you.

48:44.070 --> 48:47.070
- That was cool.
- Yeah, right?

48:50.810 --> 48:55.050
Hi, I'd like to urge you to vote
for Susan Davis on November 2nd.

49:03.420 --> 49:07.160
Amazing, I really appreciate your
time and support. Thank you.

49:07.160 --> 49:10.100
Hold this photo for the
bio in the front page.

49:10.660 --> 49:13.230
Un-fucking-believable.

49:14.670 --> 49:17.170
I mean, honey, I'm willing
to match funding, but,

49:17.170 --> 49:21.170
quarter of a million dollars that's a lot of
money for me right now with the campaign.

49:21.180 --> 49:23.010
Well, I mean we're already
off to a big start.

49:23.010 --> 49:24.840
But, I honestly think it is
gonna help your campaign.

49:24.850 --> 49:27.350
I mean just imagine, Susan Davis
asks all of Seattle to match

49:27.350 --> 49:29.820
her gift
to the Alzheimer's wing.

49:29.820 --> 49:31.350
That's very generous of you.

49:31.350 --> 49:33.420
Lucky for me the stock market
in this country mostly goes up.

49:33.420 --> 49:36.150
Is that how you got successful,
from the stock market?

49:36.160 --> 49:37.760
When I was young,
I saved my money.

49:37.760 --> 49:41.660
I bought this commercial real estate
property and renovated it, sold it.

49:41.660 --> 49:43.800
And I took the profits
and put it in the market.

49:43.800 --> 49:46.600
So, my first deal was a winning
deal and that set me in motion.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.670
I've done that about
a 100 times over now.

49:48.670 --> 49:50.470
I think that's how you
get wealthy in America.

49:50.470 --> 49:52.600
It's just this sort
of specialized duplication.

49:52.610 --> 49:55.210
Yes, and of course you have to
have the education and resources.

49:55.210 --> 49:57.780
I mean my mother here, she's
an attorney and an MBA.

49:57.780 --> 49:59.710
Wow, swish, that's cool.

49:59.710 --> 50:04.550
So, fucking All channel has syndicated this
hawk Charles Fern throughout the whole state.

50:04.550 --> 50:07.420
- I mean where did this guy come from?
- Who is this guy?

50:07.420 --> 50:10.260
He's a replacement for Tom Fleischman.
You heard about that show?

50:10.520 --> 50:11.290
No.

50:11.290 --> 50:12.590
Oh, it's a horrible show.

50:12.590 --> 50:14.790
I don't think anyone
listens to that quack.

50:14.800 --> 50:16.530
Oh, yeah they do
and the kid is a star.

50:16.530 --> 50:19.360
His listeners hold on to his
every word like it's Gospel.

50:19.370 --> 50:22.900
He called you a lesbian
sympathizer.

50:22.900 --> 50:24.540
Wait, what does that even mean?

50:24.540 --> 50:26.540
It means your mom
isn't against gay marriage.

50:26.540 --> 50:29.310
Well, yeah I mean your not.
Isn't that law.

50:29.310 --> 50:33.510
Right. But, we don't want to get
dragged into those trenches.

50:35.280 --> 50:38.080
I've been listening to that
scumbag all morning.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.250
- Ethan?
- What?

50:41.190 --> 50:42.690
Why are you here?

50:42.690 --> 50:46.530
Oh, I'm just volunteering.
Helping out with the phones.

50:46.530 --> 50:50.130
Well, no one gives better
phone than you do.

50:50.130 --> 50:54.470
Look, Adrienne I want you to find
every weed out of this fucking Fern.

50:56.440 --> 50:58.200
- Done.
- Look, all I am saying is

50:58.210 --> 51:00.310
that it is no coincidence
this guy is out here now.

51:00.310 --> 51:02.510
I mean all those guys are
Bible thumpers at All Channel.

51:02.510 --> 51:04.680
They imported this nutter
butter from Maine.

51:04.680 --> 51:05.980
I need you to get him out.

51:05.980 --> 51:08.450
- You'll see. Bye guys.
- Great.

51:10.680 --> 51:16.090
Prelim figures from indicate ratings for
the fall book are gonna be very strong.

51:16.090 --> 51:18.090
I've never seen so many e-mails.

51:18.090 --> 51:20.230
Mmm-hmm. And guess what?

51:21.160 --> 51:23.300
I got the go ahead from Peter.

51:23.300 --> 51:25.560
We're sending the Charles Fern
show on the road

51:25.570 --> 51:28.200
following Sollow for the last
stretch of the election.

51:28.200 --> 51:30.370
- On the road?
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

51:31.970 --> 51:33.340
Your boy is a phenom.

51:39.610 --> 51:43.920
Well, this is my special place
for special people.

51:43.920 --> 51:46.250
You are hereby sworn to secrecy.

51:46.250 --> 51:48.520
I will take an oath of silence.

51:53.660 --> 51:55.160
This is so beautiful.

51:57.060 --> 52:01.700
I don't know Julia,
I am just not who I appear to be.

52:06.740 --> 52:08.140
Are you in the closet?

52:09.880 --> 52:12.910
Yeah. Are you in the closet?

52:12.910 --> 52:14.880
No, but, I don't know...

52:16.150 --> 52:18.650
I'm working for this other
radio station,

52:19.220 --> 52:21.850
to make money on the side.

52:21.860 --> 52:25.560
Okay so what? You're playing music
you don't believe in, or, something?

52:27.330 --> 52:30.800
Yeah, I'm playing music
I don't believe in.

52:32.670 --> 52:33.930
I don't even know...

52:35.300 --> 52:37.770
What I believe in right now.

52:37.770 --> 52:39.200
You know I'm just...

52:39.210 --> 52:42.040
I think you know
who to believe in.

52:42.040 --> 52:44.010
That's why you feel
the way you do.

52:44.010 --> 52:46.610
It's a conundrum.

52:46.610 --> 52:50.520
Whatever problems you think you
have, Ethan, they are manageable.

52:53.090 --> 52:56.920
You are right,
you are absolutely right, Julia.

53:04.600 --> 53:08.170
Last week Seattle's radio
personality Charles Fern

53:08.170 --> 53:11.370
began a simple boycott
of Ridicule's music.

53:11.370 --> 53:14.970
Tonight we join that boycott.

53:14.980 --> 53:18.710
Here at the Vacuum with our millions
of cleaners around the world,

53:18.710 --> 53:22.210
we want to send a clear message
to those at Periscope records.

53:22.220 --> 53:24.550
While we will never legislate
corporate ethics,

53:24.550 --> 53:28.050
we will only support products
that reflect our values.

53:28.060 --> 53:30.990
<i>Thanks very much everybody.
I'm Bob Bernard, that's it from me for today.</i>

53:30.990 --> 53:35.630
<i>We'll see you tomorrow
and until the the vacuum is sealed.</i>

53:35.630 --> 53:37.460
Wow.

53:37.460 --> 53:40.700
The Charles Fern show is having
a cultural effect.

53:40.700 --> 53:45.940
Guys, listen I am done
with Charles Fern.

53:45.940 --> 53:47.270
What are you talking about?

53:47.270 --> 53:49.040
I just can't do this anymore.
This is ridiculous.

53:49.040 --> 53:52.380
Hey, don't start with the sorry
Charlie bullshit. We're on a roll.

53:52.380 --> 53:54.050
You can't quit now.

53:54.050 --> 53:57.250
Look I'm seeing Ann Alcott tonight
and I' gonna get liquored up

53:57.250 --> 53:58.650
and I'll just tell her
that I am a fraud.

53:58.650 --> 54:02.920
No, no, this is fucking insane.
You, hey, Ethan.

54:03.860 --> 54:05.760
You have a gift.
You are gifted.

54:05.760 --> 54:08.260
- And this is your destiny.
- My destiny?

54:09.100 --> 54:11.400
Hi. Hello, Ethan.

54:11.400 --> 54:14.970
- Hi, Adrienne.
- So I head you started seeing Julia Davis.

54:16.600 --> 54:18.000
Okay.

54:18.010 --> 54:19.500
I thought I'd be the first to tell
you that I am seeing Woodrow.

54:19.510 --> 54:22.340
- Your cameraman?
- No, cinematographer.

54:22.340 --> 54:24.040
Well, I'm very happy
for you guys.

54:24.040 --> 54:27.050
He's very, very, very caring. And
he's got something you don't.

54:27.650 --> 54:28.580
Integrity.

54:28.580 --> 54:32.520
So, Neil do you know that
you work for a fascista?

54:32.520 --> 54:34.820
- What?
- Charles Fern, that's what.

54:34.820 --> 54:36.620
And I am here to get
the straight poop,

54:36.620 --> 54:39.060
because there is no one
in Maine with that name.

54:39.060 --> 54:42.160
Well, maybe it's a stage name.

54:42.160 --> 54:44.060
Like Liberace, or, Mitt Romney.

54:44.060 --> 54:45.260
Exactly.

54:45.270 --> 54:47.400
And I think I found the
real Mccoy.

54:49.240 --> 54:50.800
Charles Fernando.

54:51.740 --> 54:52.670
Does that look like him?

54:54.340 --> 54:57.580
You know the more I gaze,
yeah.

54:58.280 --> 55:01.250
- Mexican dude.
- Fernando, yeah.

55:01.250 --> 55:04.420
So, your boss is into
some really serious shit.

55:04.420 --> 55:07.820
- Cocaine, hookers.
- Charles Fern is doing cocaine?

55:07.820 --> 55:11.290
No, Charles Fern is doing
hookers and selling cocaine.

55:11.290 --> 55:12.860
So where do I find this Fern?

55:12.860 --> 55:16.530
- I don't know, he's reclusive.
- Oh, is he? Well, I'll find him.

55:16.530 --> 55:19.700
I'll find him faster than you
can say Osama Bin Laden.

55:21.970 --> 55:23.770
Bye guys. Thank you.

55:23.770 --> 55:29.640
Now, I outlined in my new number
one New York times bestseller,

55:29.640 --> 55:32.580
A brief history of liars
from Hitler to Hillary,

55:32.580 --> 55:34.810
the methodology
in which

55:34.820 --> 55:39.580
the liberal establishment
has invaded academia.

55:40.490 --> 55:43.590
The truth is liberals
hate science.

55:43.590 --> 55:47.090
They believe that humans
are equivalent to rodents.

55:48.530 --> 55:51.660
Well, I am here to tell you
that American students

55:51.670 --> 55:54.670
deserve more than
evolutionary dogma.

56:01.670 --> 56:05.740
But, Washington,
there is good news.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.410
We have a new voice in town.

56:08.420 --> 56:11.380
A fresh voice.
A voice that many of us believe

56:11.390 --> 56:15.150
is going to lead our
party into greatness.

56:15.160 --> 56:18.590
So, please with a very warm
welcome,

56:18.590 --> 56:20.990
welcome Charles Fern.

56:29.270 --> 56:30.770
Gosh, you look gorgeous.

56:32.440 --> 56:33.940
Isn't she gorgeous?

56:35.710 --> 56:40.010
Wow, what a good book, huh?
What a good read.

56:40.010 --> 56:42.450
Pick it up.
Pick it up.

56:42.450 --> 56:44.480
- And what a gorgeous group of humans.
- Yes.

56:45.420 --> 56:47.450
Gorgeous humans.

56:47.450 --> 56:50.090
Well, listen, I've prepared
a little something.

56:52.560 --> 56:55.760
They'll spit and spat.
They'll tell their tale.

56:55.760 --> 56:58.000
Call Daddy chimp
and mommy whale.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.430
They'll chirp and chime
and make their claim.

57:00.430 --> 57:03.540
Mold of man is whence we came.

57:03.540 --> 57:05.770
But, evolutionists be damned.

57:05.770 --> 57:09.210
We're more than beasts,
by god, we're man.

57:09.210 --> 57:14.050
And Darwin is a proven fool. His
theory merely cock and bull.

57:15.450 --> 57:17.750
So, free your body,
free your mind.

57:17.750 --> 57:21.090
Embrace intelligent design.

57:39.610 --> 57:43.210
You know Ann there is something very
serious I want to talk to you about.

57:43.210 --> 57:45.380
Anything for you, Charles.

57:45.380 --> 57:47.180
Essential oils,
I couldn't believe it.

57:49.080 --> 57:51.050
Why don't we sit down first?

57:51.920 --> 57:54.190
Can we sit over there,
actually?

57:54.190 --> 57:55.890
Ricardo. Thank you.

58:00.890 --> 58:01.930
Thank you.

58:07.900 --> 58:09.430
I love this place.

58:09.440 --> 58:14.670
Oh, yes, it's such a wonderful place,
I'm really glad you picked it.

58:14.670 --> 58:18.310
This has honestly been such a lovely evening.
Thank you for an amazing dinner, Jefferson.

58:18.310 --> 58:21.210
I'm so happy to have you back.
I missed you like crazy.

58:22.210 --> 58:23.880
I missed you too.

58:24.380 --> 58:26.580
<i>Buonasera.</i>

58:26.590 --> 58:30.020
Hello, your Merlot,
Miss Alcott?

58:30.020 --> 58:31.420
Yes, thank you, Phillipe.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.690
And for the gentleman
in the fabulous jacket?

58:33.690 --> 58:36.160
Thank you.
You're so kind.

58:36.160 --> 58:39.200
I'll have a Shirley Temple
with Jack Daniels please.

58:39.200 --> 58:40.730
An excellent choice.

58:42.740 --> 58:46.140
So, Charles, do you live in a
house or an apartment in Maine.

58:46.140 --> 58:47.840
Well, that's funny you ask...

58:47.840 --> 58:51.580
It's actually a log cabin that my grandfather
built with a pick ax and a hammer.

58:51.580 --> 58:53.380
He built it all himself?

58:53.380 --> 58:57.320
Well, he had the help of a couple of
small Chinese railroad workers as well.

58:58.520 --> 59:01.850
It's on the lake.
It's quite lovely.

59:01.860 --> 59:04.620
Sounds stunning.
Like a Thomas Kinkade painting.

59:06.360 --> 59:08.030
Well, it is very Kinkadian.

59:09.630 --> 59:12.560
Come on, Jules, I wanna
see the sights.

59:12.570 --> 59:14.970
I suppose you've earned
a trip to my special place

59:14.970 --> 59:16.670
but, you promise to behave
yourself.

59:16.670 --> 59:19.970
Of course, no one denies
the man with the magic hands.

59:19.970 --> 59:23.010
Okay, come on,
let's go.

59:26.050 --> 59:29.650
And for the beautiful lady,
the merlow.

59:29.650 --> 59:33.690
And for the gentleman.
Your Shirley temple.

59:33.690 --> 59:36.220
With Jack Daniels, like it?

59:36.220 --> 59:40.160
- I'll give you a few minutes with the menu.
- Thank you.

59:40.160 --> 59:46.260
Well, to you Ann, a rare woman
of beauty, grace and integrity.

59:46.270 --> 59:47.800
Thank you, Charles.

59:50.540 --> 59:54.210
I want you to know Charles
that whatever it is,

59:54.210 --> 59:57.310
you have it and it needs
to be shared with the world.

59:57.310 --> 01:00:01.710
I think you are one of the
coolest people I have ever met.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.380
You are just the woman of
your word and that is rare.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.880
I feel the same about you.

01:00:07.850 --> 01:00:10.220
No, I am a student
and you are a professor.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.890
Well, I am older.

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:14.890
But, you are very beautiful.

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:38.220
I had a wonderful time tonight, Charles.
Thank you.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:41.920
Susan Davis lives in a glass
house enclosed in an ivory tower

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.590
in the center
of emerald city.

01:00:43.590 --> 01:00:47.060
All right, I have had enough of that
one, can you imagine what kind of

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.390
girlfriend you would make if
you were raised by that woman?

01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:52.100
Tell you what, huh?

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:56.000
Well, anyway listen, we're all very
excited on the fernization tour.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.070
I'm Charles Fern.
Stay wealthy Washington.

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:05.680
Hey, Ethan, your ex is at the door,
she's got a cameraman with her.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:08.080
- Adrienne and Woody?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:11.950
Put on some of the meditation music or something?
You have any of that?

01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:14.820
Put on some... Do some instruction
video or something like that.

01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.750
- What?
- Stretch.

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:21.030
Deeper down, going
south, going south.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:24.500
Oh, my God, what are you doing?

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:28.170
Rouge, I really actually... I'm sick of that...
I like the choice of the Jeans, because,

01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:30.470
It probably keeps your
inner thighs pretty warm.

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:33.370
What are you guys doing here?
This is the Charles Fern show.

01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:35.640
Oh, no, not anymore
actually, that's over.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.480
We use this space
for post show yoga.

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:42.650
You guys are really welcome
to join us in some yoga motion.

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:46.880
Actually we're good.
Cause Woody stretched me out this morning.

01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:48.850
Show him.

01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:52.220
Wow, that's some details.

01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:54.960
Actually I have something
for you. This is a check.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.300
You can just call that
a peace offering.

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:00.230
Where did you get this money?

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:02.970
Doughglobes is picking up.

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:06.600
Fried food for fat people.

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:10.070
When this check clears I'll give
you back your precious guitar.

01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.210
Okay.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.380
All right guys, going back
to going farther south down.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.790
Neil, you gotta watch Ears

01:02:21.790 --> 01:02:23.860
Me, I'm going on the road

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.490
No, you're not.

01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:27.430
Ears wide shut cannot fall apart.
Do you understand what this is?

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:30.630
Dude, there's no way.
I'm not a public speaker.

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.130
There's no public.

01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:34.500
What if I get sick
and I lose my voice?

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.000
- And, I just can't...
- Neil...

01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:40.170
Buck the fuck up.
Just buck up.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:44.310
- Buck up.
- I don't even know what that is.

01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.380

I love you more.

01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:43.840
Charles, we can't argue with
a rally like that.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.200
That crowd was speaking.

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:49.910
And his message is really resonating.
Resonating indeed.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.310
Yeah, that's true.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.280
I just gotta thank the team.

01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.680
For the hard work
they are doing. And,

01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:01.920
in particular, you have really electrified
this race Charles, thank you.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.820
Exactly, we're a great team,
Charles.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:07.260
This week with the governor, Charles
has exceeded all expectations.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.760
We just analyzed a cross
section of polling data,

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.860
we are trending up, up, up.

01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:14.370
Well, he's the man.

01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:19.770
Charles Fern I'd like to talk
to you about your past record.

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.510
What are you talking about?

01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:22.740
What am I talking about?

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.310

Charles, see I've been trying to quit
smoking and I am having hell of a time.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.900
And I have a date tonight.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.170
- Care for a patch, Charles?
- No, I'm fine.

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:54.810
How about some vertigo lift?

01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:56.810

I've ever been on.

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:16.390
It's a Long drive.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.100
Just call her.

01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:21.430

01:05:27.170 --> 01:05:29.140
Ethan, where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.840
I left you like
a dozen messages.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.610
I got the message so to speak.

01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:35.510
Look, why didn't you tell me
you were dating Jefferson?

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.850
What are you talking about?

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:39.250
I went to the brewery on Tuesday night.
I know what's going on.

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:42.790
Brewery? Oh, god no.
Jefferson is just my friend.

01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:44.420
Oh, just a friend huh?

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:47.220
Well, did your friend's magic
hands get down your magic pants?

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:49.460
Hey, he's a cardiothoracic
surgeon, that's a joke.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:52.330

took him to your special place.

What are my facts then
Jackie O nasty?

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.040
I know you are not speaking
to me like that.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.310
And just so you know,
my special place,

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:04.640
is the name of the pediatric
ward in the hospital.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.040
<i>If you don't believe me,

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:11.350
I'm such an idiot.

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:16.620
Look, I know that Jefferson likes me
but he hasn't crossed any boundaries.

01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.590
And, I would never mess with
your mind like that.

01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:21.760
I'm sorry, that was just...

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:25.630

01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:08.670
Thank you, I'm sorry you
had to deal with that.

01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:12.140
Wow. You have your own doll.

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:14.410
You sell a lot of these?

01:08:14.410 --> 01:08:18.109
Yes, some for novelty,
some for craftsmanship.

01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:19.880

What?

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:39.460
I've been waiting to meet a man
who I could give my body to.

01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.470
Someone who I could share my
views and my values with.

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.910

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:02.220

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.260

I need to apologize for.

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:08.490
Listen, there is something
I need to tell you.

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:10.660

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.300
No, it's not that,
I love old women,

01:09:19.310 --> 01:09:23.210
it's just that there is someone
else I am betraying.

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:25.910
Don't tell me you are married
to somebody else in Maine.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:28.609
Yes.

01:09:28.609 --> 01:09:32.120
That's exactly it.
I am married to someone in Maine.

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.189
You are destroying her life.
She made a commitment to you,

01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:40.319
God and man, and Marriage...
And you...

01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:42.790

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:45.529

It's not like that.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.729

01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:53.399

01:09:53.410 --> 01:09:55.470
Yes, it's a little bit weird
to talk about.

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:58.340
But, I met this
fly and tackle hand

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.680
who helped me haul some wood
to my cabin in Maine, and...

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.950
Well, we were in close quarters
during a very violent tornado.

01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:08.650
And after the sun rose...

01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:12.220
We drove all the way to Rowan County
and that's where we tied the knot.

01:10:20.170 --> 01:10:22.000
So are you for gay marriage?

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.240
Yes.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.670
Yeah, that's a deal breaker.

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.080

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.250
You know...

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:41.920
I always thought there was
something off about that guy.

he's now a producer

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.440

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.310

01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:43.570
Yes!

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.680
Yes! Yes! Yes! Thank you!

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.980
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:50.950
Excuse me, I need a moment
alone with Charles.

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:53.620
Thank you. Now, thank you.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:54.720
Thank you.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.960
I'll step over here.

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:11.070
Wow.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:16.140
We have already signed this.

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:23.710
And as soon as you do, you will
get your 300,000 dollar advance.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.080
And we're gonna take you coast
to coast.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:29.890
Congratulations, my boy.

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:36.130
- Hey, bud, how you doing?
- I'm good.

01:13:36.130 --> 01:13:37.730
This is going
national tomorrow.

01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:39.260
Yeah, you know what you did.

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:41.100
- What is this?
- Ethan.

01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:45.400
Come on, if you have anything to say for
yourself, now is your opportunity. Go.

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.670
Okay, listen I will talk
to you off camera, but you

01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:49.540
will have to get rid
off the paparazzi.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.110
Listen, I am not paparazzi,

01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:54.340
I am a cinematographer, you <i>fascista.</i>
- That's right.

01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:57.410
Ethan you are going to be
exposed, okay.

01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:59.880
I mean, I don't even know
who you are anymore.

01:13:59.890 --> 01:14:01.590
I don't think you ever
knew who I was.

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:04.350
Really? Well, guess what
I am not interested anymore.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.790
- Oh, you are not?
- But Bob Bernard is.

01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:09.090
Can I have my
guitar back, please?

01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:12.800
And when Julia finds out, her
little heart is gonna be crushed.

01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:18.640
Where you going?

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.170
- I'm leaving.
- Oh, yeah.

01:14:20.170 --> 01:14:22.510
- Get out of here.
- Leaving?

01:14:27.210 --> 01:14:31.780
Whoo! Well, shit that was
the best sound it ever made.

01:14:33.690 --> 01:14:34.620
Bye.

01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.730
Hey, I gotta talk to you
about something.

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.430
Okay, you are gonna come
to election night, right?

01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:48.730
I mean, win or lose I'd really
like it if you could be there.

01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.070
- Yes, I definitely wanna go.
- Okay.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.940
Liar.

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:02.410
Oh, my God. That's Mr. Fleischman's
first word since the stroke.

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:06.280
Tom, I'm so sorry Buddy.
Are you okay?

01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:08.550
Do you know him?

01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:11.660
Well, I think he's gone
back to sleep.

01:15:13.730 --> 01:15:15.390
You are working
with Tom Fleischman?

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:16.960
Well, yeah, what do you mean?

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.870
Okay, come on I work in a hospital,
I give everyone equal care.

01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:24.670
There's something I really got
to talk to you about, okay?

01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:28.710
Do you remember the radio station I was
helping out with? The other radio station?

01:15:28.710 --> 01:15:30.310
Yeah.

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:32.410
It was Tom Fleischman's
show. And,

01:15:32.410 --> 01:15:36.710
When he couldn't fill in, I
stepped in and I covered for him.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:37.850
So what?

01:15:39.850 --> 01:15:42.250
- I'm Charles Fern.
- Okay, that's not funny.

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:43.750
No, I'm Charles Fern, listen.

01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:49.090
Good morning, Washingtonians, I'm
your humble guest host, Charles Fern.

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:57.570
It's me, Julia.

01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:59.340
Okay, wait, so your telling
me that your the person

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:00.970
who has been attacking
my mother?

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.040
Sort of...
I just...

01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:05.380
- It was all a joke.
- It was not funny.

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:06.910
All channel offered me
all this money.

01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:09.410
I honestly don't know what I am
supposed to say to you right now.

01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.180
I can't forgive you for this.

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.750
Okay, look it's fine if you don't
want my mother to be governor,

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:17.620
but, to malign her in such a
way in a ridiculous costume...

01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:19.460
Listen I didn't mean
to hurt anyone.

01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.290
Okay you know what, that is just what every
hypocrite says, and you did hurt somebody.

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:27.730
I completely misjudged you. I thought you
were someone who had, I don't know...

01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:30.170
- Integrity?
- Yes. It's time for you to leave.

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:32.400
- Can you just give me another chance?
- It's too late.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.070
Please.

01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:36.840
- What are you doing?
- Can I get security to 604 please?

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:39.740
Get off of me,
I have feet you know.

01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:44.210
Tell me what I can
do and I'll do it all right?

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:46.550
Don't make this worse, man,
come on, have some dignity.

01:16:46.550 --> 01:16:48.150
Can you please move along?

01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:53.490
Julia, I love you okay,
there I said it.

01:16:53.490 --> 01:16:55.530
Now you might not see me
for the rest of my life.

01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:59.460
But, I still love you and I'll always love you.
That might be a cliche but, it's true.

01:16:59.470 --> 01:17:01.570
Oh, man, I think you
just shoot me.

01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:03.630
Put the camera over there
and you just shoot me.

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.870
Like where? Like in the head?

01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:08.710
Well, I don't know.
I think maybe in this area.

01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:10.840
We can't shoot it in here
because like...

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:13.810
- You'll know that I shot you.
- You'll be out of the frame.

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:16.150
Then we shoot Charles Fern.

01:17:16.150 --> 01:17:17.750
Why don't we go somewhere
and shoot?

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.520
Yes, you would do that.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.790
Hey, hey, don't fuck around.
What the hell?

01:17:23.790 --> 01:17:25.890
Rouge, we're not fucking
around, all right?

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.890
Charles Fern must die.

01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:29.760
You ain't gonna
kill him with a BB gun.

01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:34.260
Well, we tried to think of
things man, but Adrienne...

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:37.300
She's onto me man.
She's got the photo composites.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:41.270
We deny it. And then we deny it again,
and then we deny it again.

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:45.340
Yeah but she's got me on tape and
then Ann Alcott thinks I'm gay.

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:48.080
- She does?
- Yeah.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.750
Gay is okay,
we can work with gay.

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:56.690
- Dude, did you invite someone over?
- No.

01:17:59.190 --> 01:18:01.760
It's your crazy ex girlfriend
again.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.760
Go hide in the bathroom.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.970
Oh, oh, oh...

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.440
Thank you.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.370
Wow.
This is really...

01:18:14.370 --> 01:18:20.680
Boy, oh, boy, I always knew that there
was something different about you.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:22.350
That's probably
the Maine thing.

01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:25.480
The Maine thing.
And the main thing is honesty.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.880
Really, thank you,
that's wonderful.

01:18:27.890 --> 01:18:29.890
Oh, Ryan that's really...

01:18:29.890 --> 01:18:33.790
Ann told me everything.

01:18:33.790 --> 01:18:37.130
She told you everything...
You're...

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:41.900
- Oh yeah, right well you are a married man.
- So are you.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:44.970
Well, I'm married to a man so...

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:50.210
Hey, Lucy is my best friend...
But, that's it.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.980
I have never...

01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:57.750
Oh, gosh.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:01.520
Well, things are a little more
complicated than...

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.550
...than you think actually
Ryan, so...

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.220
Wait, wait, you and Rouge?

01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:09.860
Yeah, I know. Right well, the
cat's out of the bag now.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:10.990
Wow.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:13.030
Does Neil know?

01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:16.330
Oh, of course, cause
he was our best man.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.570
And the maid of honor.

01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:19.200
Rouge, please accept my
sincerest apology.

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:22.510
I wouldn't have tried anything
if I knew you and Charles...

01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:25.540
No, no Rouge and I yes, if we
weren't happily married...

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:29.210
You'd be a perfect really
good catch. You'd be a catch.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:32.780
You know Ryan, thank you
so much for coming by.

01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:36.550
It's really been delightful. Yup this
way is the door. That way is the door.

01:19:37.290 --> 01:19:38.560
Just get a good cab home.

01:19:56.410 --> 01:19:57.340
Take off your glasses.

01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:06.980
Here comes the cool part.

01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.160
Ah!
Oh!

01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.230
Ow!

01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:22.900
Oh! Ow!

01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:30.940
You okay?

01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:32.880
Rouge, you all right?

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.210
I'm all right.
Give me my fucking phone.

01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:37.110
You got a little
blood on your hand.

01:20:40.450 --> 01:20:41.380
Get outta here.

01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:43.420
Sure buddy.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.360
Rouge, thanks.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.070
Yeah, hey we have an
emergency.

01:20:58.070 --> 01:21:03.210
I was hunting and we got
attacked by a grizzly bear.

01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:23.160
Hello?

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.330
Holy shit!

01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:31.400
Okay...

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:34.540
Charles...

01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:37.210
Saw a little bear cub.

01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:41.010
A baby bear cub.

01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:43.810
Stuck under
a small boulder and...

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:45.680
Well, he went to help
the little fella and...

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.680
Out of nowhere this...

01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:51.190
The bear came...

01:21:51.190 --> 01:21:54.260
Must have been the mama.
Grizzly bear.

01:21:55.690 --> 01:21:59.460
Jeez, Rouge you know better than to
hunt cascades this time of the year?

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:04.030
I know, but, Charles he twisted my arm,
he was an avid hunter, it was so dumb.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.070
And the grizzly had him
by the neck you say?

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:07.040
Yes.

01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.270
I fear the worst.

01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:13.410
Teared him off like
a cat crazy kitten.

01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:14.340
I fear the worst.

01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.520
Oh, really?

01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.650
All right, well keep
searching through the night.

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:32.300
Well, they found some glasses
on the ground.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.300
Polka dotted bow tie.

01:22:36.970 --> 01:22:38.100
I'm sorry.

01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:47.340
Okay, okay, it's fine.

01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:49.410
Hey, hey, hey.
It's okay.

01:22:52.150 --> 01:22:54.880
<i>And the most ludicrous item
of the week comes to us from the</i>

01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:57.320
<i>leftist documentarian,
Adrienne Lockhart.</i>

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.420
<i>Last week she claimed that
the recently deceased</i>

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:03.260
radio commentator Charles Fern who
died nobly trying to save a bear cub

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:05.500
was actually her ex-boyfriend.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.700
<i>This after claims that Charles Fern
was famed Mexican drug runner,</i>

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:12.500
<i>Charles Fernando.</i>

01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.440
<i>So what is she basing her
most recent claim on?</i>

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:18.070
<i>A grainy photo she matched
using computer enhancements.</i>

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.410
This one wouldn't pass
the Dan Rather smell test.

01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:23.850
- Come on.
<i>- Libelous, perhaps.</i>

01:23:23.850 --> 01:23:25.750
<i>Ludicrous...
Without question.</i>

01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:28.390
Thanks very much everyone. I am Bob Bernard.
That's all from me for today.

01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:30.190
That's it?
That's it?

01:23:30.190 --> 01:23:32.390
That's all for you today.
Jesus.

01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:41.060
Well, it's virtual time.

01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:44.770
95 percent of the precincts are in and
yet no one can get a straight count.

01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:46.700
It's gonna be a long night.

01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.910
Julia are you all right?
You just don't seem like yourself?

01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:56.650
Yeah, no, I am just ready for
the campaign to be over.

01:23:56.650 --> 01:24:00.620
Me too. Oh, I did get some good news
today that will make you happy.

01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:03.620
Harborview called me and they
got a match for my donation.

01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:04.690
What?

01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:06.760
Yeah, the Alzheimer wing
is saved.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.590
- Serious?
- It was so strange.

01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:13.200
Okay, the guy that donated was that
right winger who died, Charles Fern.

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.830
You don't say.

01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:19.300
Yeah. And then I guess he donated it
right before the grizzly incident.

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:22.210
The guy had it coming.
Car police should step right in.

01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:25.180
Well, I didn't like what
he was saying about me

01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:27.580
but, he obviously
had a different side.

01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:28.710
The bear thought so too.

01:24:30.710 --> 01:24:34.550
Poor thing. Did you read what they wrote.
How they found him?

01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:38.660
Apparently the bear
stuffed him in a tree.

01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:42.160
Like ate him just
a little bit at a time.

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.590
Like <i>The Revenant.</i>

01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.660
I haven't seen that movie.

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:34.640
Say it again.

01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:37.550
I promise for the rest
of my life

01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:40.180
I will never wear
another bow tie.

01:25:41.305 --> 01:25:47.931
