WEBVTT

00:03.269 --> 00:05.270
<i>"Last Man Standing"</i>
<i>is recorded</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:06.605
<i>In front of a live</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

00:06.607 --> 00:08.107
Oh, hey, Mandy.
Hi.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.942
Oh, still working
on that dress?
Yeah.

00:09.944 --> 00:12.111
Well, the dealie
that goes up and down

00:12.113 --> 00:13.278
Got kind of caught up
with the thingy

00:13.280 --> 00:14.613
That goes
around and around, so...

00:15.515 --> 00:17.816
Wow -- one month
into the fashion program,

00:17.818 --> 00:21.220
And you already know your
"dealies" from your "thingies."
yeah.

00:21.222 --> 00:22.388
Oh, mom.
Yeah?

00:22.390 --> 00:24.289
I want you to have
this original design sketch.

00:24.291 --> 00:27.059
It's going to be worth millions
when I'm famous.
Ooh, ahh.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.561
Famous? It's the u.C. Denver
school of design.

00:29.563 --> 00:32.531
Who teaches there,
the guy who invented flannel?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.733
Y-you know, d-don't you think
this dress is --

00:34.735 --> 00:36.869
Is a little ambitious
for your first project?

00:36.871 --> 00:39.004
Mom, don't worry. I've been
making my own clothes forever.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.173
Yeah, you've been <i>altering</i>
<i>your own clothes, but you</i>
<i>haven't made an outfit</i>

00:41.175 --> 00:43.842
Since that tube top
for your cabbage patch kid.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.078
Anyways, I'm gonna be
totally fine, okay?

00:46.080 --> 00:47.379
I have three whole days

00:47.381 --> 00:49.548
To make one
teenie-tiny cocktail dress.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.550
Yeah, and I'm sure
after a couple of cocktails,

00:51.552 --> 00:54.386
Someone might mistake this
for a dress.

00:55.422 --> 00:58.190
Oh, hey, babe.
What you doing?

00:58.192 --> 00:59.324
Nothing.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.826
Unless you have
something for me to do.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.594
Then I'm really busy.

01:03.763 --> 01:06.098
Hi, mom.
Vanessa: Hey.

01:06.100 --> 01:10.002
We just came from <i>the</i> most
exciting p.T.A. Meeting ever.

01:10.004 --> 01:11.170
You know, for the record,

01:11.172 --> 01:12.938
No man on earth
has ever said those words.

01:13.773 --> 01:15.441
The first graders
had an assignment

01:15.443 --> 01:17.443
To write a paragraph
about captain william clark,

01:17.445 --> 01:19.111
The guy
the school is named for.
Ooh.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.780
Yeah,
lewis and clark, 1804.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.583
They blazed a trail from
missouri to the pacific coast.

01:24.585 --> 01:25.784
You know,
lewis went on to make

01:25.786 --> 01:28.954
A series of very funny movies
with dean martin.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.790
And, of course, the lands that
they supposedly discovered

01:31.792 --> 01:34.093
Were already home to
millions of indigenous people.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.928
But those indigenous people --
the indians --

01:35.930 --> 01:37.996
Got us all hooked
on tobacco.

01:39.299 --> 01:42.101
So I think
it kind of evens itself out.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.969
Anyway, it came up
at the meeting

01:43.971 --> 01:47.806
That one of the kids discovered
clark was a slave owner.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.542
Oh, come on. This was all dug up
by a first grader?

01:50.544 --> 01:52.544
It was a first grader who's,
like, 5'11", bearded,

01:52.546 --> 01:53.846
And sitting right over there.
Mm-hmm.

01:54.547 --> 01:56.215
Mommy!
Mommy! Daddy!

01:56.217 --> 01:58.050
Ha!
Hey! Hey!

01:58.052 --> 01:59.384
There's
my little muckraker.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.453
Do you really think
it's a good idea

02:01.455 --> 02:04.323
To drag my grandson into
tearing down this American hero?

02:04.325 --> 02:05.557
It's called "research,"
Mike.

02:05.559 --> 02:06.959
We just went
where the facts led us.

02:06.961 --> 02:10.462
Did you know
clark ate over 200 dogs?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.464
I was gonna put that
in the paper,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.566
But I didn't
want to make people sad.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.935
Bring them down
after all that fun slave stuff.

02:16.937 --> 02:20.572
Dad, listen,
I'm actually really proud

02:20.574 --> 02:22.107
That Boyd
was so into this.

02:22.109 --> 02:25.144
A-although now I'm questioning
why he suddenly wants a puppy.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.980
People deserve to hear
the whole story about clark.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.815
You know, when -- when history
is written by the winners,

02:29.817 --> 02:31.250
The losers get no voice.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.185
One of them does.

02:33.187 --> 02:36.788
Dad, clark <i>owned</i> people, okay?
That's a big deal.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.024
And now there's a petition
going around to change
the school's name.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.325
Oh, stop that!
Wait a minute.
W-w-w-wait!

02:40.327 --> 02:41.960
Isn't that kind of drastic?

02:41.962 --> 02:44.630
I mean, there's -- there's
a lot of history in that school.
Right.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.266
Yeah, we just hate the idea
of honoring a slave owner.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.067
Well, don't go to d.C.
No.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.171
You know, washington
was a slave owner,

02:52.173 --> 02:54.006
And they gave him
his own monument.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.275
Yeah, and then a bridge
was named after him.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.776
And a town.
And a state.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.345
And a-a...A denzel.

03:02.315 --> 03:06.351
-- Captions by vitac --

03:09.155 --> 03:11.156
Hey, honey, you know,

03:11.158 --> 03:13.792
We've been eating a lot
of oatmeal and fruit these days.

03:13.794 --> 03:16.128
I'm just saying that maybe
for a couple days

03:16.130 --> 03:17.329
We try bacon and eggs.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.330
Hmm? Oh, sure.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.665
Right, right, right.
Now, listen --

03:19.667 --> 03:21.833
Thinking outside the box here,
we go with just bacon.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.001
Yeah, all right. Yep.

03:23.003 --> 03:25.003
What's the matter?
Hmm? Mnh-mnh.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.171
You're not listening to me.
No. No.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.306
You're just saying yes
to everything I say,

03:27.308 --> 03:31.143
And I wasted it on bacon!

03:31.145 --> 03:32.411
I'm sorry, honey.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.513
You know, it's j-- it's this
thing with Boyd's school.

03:34.515 --> 03:36.515
Oh, come on. Let them have
whatever they want.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.916
It's 10:30.
I'm over it.

03:37.918 --> 03:41.553
Are you still in that "say yes
to everything I want" mode?

03:43.022 --> 03:45.724
You know, if they change
the name of clark elementary,

03:45.726 --> 03:47.859
It's not just the sign
on the front door.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.194
There's a lot of things
around that school

03:49.196 --> 03:50.362
That depict lewis and clark,

03:50.364 --> 03:51.697
And they'll probably
get rid of those, too.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.833
What are you talking about?
S-sign out front and then the...

03:54.835 --> 03:57.169
The mural in the lobby.
Aha.

03:57.171 --> 03:59.104
What?

03:59.106 --> 04:01.273
The mural in the lobby,
the one that you built

04:01.275 --> 04:04.276
When you were
the president of the p.T.A.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.912
Oh!
I forgot about that.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.047
Yeah.

04:09.049 --> 04:11.216
I mean, no, it --
it would be so petty of me

04:11.218 --> 04:15.220
To try to save some silly,
beautiful, beautiful mural

04:15.222 --> 04:18.757
That we spent months designing
and sketching and painting.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.292
You just want to save
that stupid mural.
[ sighs ] no, no.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.294
Everybody loves that mural,
Mike.

04:22.296 --> 04:25.297
It was the highlight of my reign
as p.T.A. President.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.966
Your reign?

04:27.968 --> 04:29.968
That mural is a piece of me
that I just --

04:29.970 --> 04:31.737
I thought
would be there forever.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.572
Mandy's class
helped make it.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.441
And every time Boyd walks
past it, he thinks of me.

04:36.443 --> 04:40.112
And maybe a little
of lewis and clark.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.481
You know, you have some skin
in this, too.
I know.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.616
You were the model
for william clark.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.618
Yep.
Ugh. That was your art teacher
who talked me into that.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.287
"you're the perfect model
for this,

04:48.289 --> 04:50.789
"with your chiseled jaw
and your steely eyes

04:50.791 --> 04:52.291
And your firm butt."

04:52.293 --> 04:54.626
Oh, man.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.795
You've seen the mural.
I...

04:56.797 --> 04:58.130
And now the school board

04:58.132 --> 04:59.731
Will probably slap paint
all over that, too.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.467
Listen, you know somebody
on the school board.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.969
Just give her a call.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.304
What? Carol larabee?
Yeah.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.973
Oh, come on!
That's so awkward.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.075
You want me to ask
an african-American woman

05:10.077 --> 05:11.977
To stand up for a guy
who owned slaves?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.645
Huh.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.415
Yeah, you don't
want to lead with that.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.749
But if you do talk to her,

05:17.751 --> 05:19.084
Don't get all self-conscious
like you normally --
I don't.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.652
Yes, you do.
No, I don't!

05:20.654 --> 05:22.988
You'll end up telling her
how you love "the wire."
what -- [ sighs ]

05:25.458 --> 05:27.793
I am not asking carol.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.795
Well, she owes us one.
You might as well ask her.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.296
You know, she asked us
to water her plants

05:31.298 --> 05:32.964
While she was on vacation.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.368
[ sighing ]

05:38.971 --> 05:41.306
Oh, by the way, we were
supposed to water her plants

05:41.308 --> 05:43.375
While
she was on vacation.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.515
<i>Hi, Mike Baxter here</i>
<i>for outdoor man,</i>

05:50.517 --> 05:52.818
<i>Here to talk to you men.</i>

05:52.820 --> 05:55.187
<i>We're obsessed</i>
<i>with our dingers.</i>

05:56.823 --> 05:59.157
<i>Our beaver bugs,</i>
<i>our salty centipedes.</i>

05:59.159 --> 06:02.227
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>I'm talking about...</i>

06:02.229 --> 06:04.062
<i>Fishing lures.</i>

06:04.064 --> 06:06.565
<i>Half price now at outdoor man.</i>

06:06.567 --> 06:08.066
<i>Now, if you thought I was</i>
<i>talking about something else</i>

06:08.068 --> 06:10.068
<i>And got offended,</i>
<i>well, I'm sorry for you.</i>

06:10.070 --> 06:12.070
<i>Because it's your</i>
<i>interpretation of the words</i>

06:12.072 --> 06:13.739
<i>That make them offensive.</i>

06:13.741 --> 06:15.741
<i>I think the same applies</i>
<i>to sports teams.</i>

06:15.743 --> 06:18.410
<i>Now, I understand why people</i>
<i>don't want to be associated</i>

06:18.412 --> 06:20.846
<i>With the name</i>
<i>"washington redskins."</i>

06:20.848 --> 06:22.848
<i>They went 3-13.</i>

06:22.850 --> 06:25.183
<i>But you don't see the folks</i>
<i>from the emerald isle</i>

06:25.185 --> 06:27.686
<i>Complaining about</i>
<i>the fighting irish, do you?</i>

06:27.688 --> 06:30.021
<i>You don't see</i>
<i>john boehner crying</i>

06:30.023 --> 06:31.857
<i>About the syracuse orangemen.</i>

06:31.859 --> 06:33.358
<i>Now, whatever the color,</i>

06:33.360 --> 06:36.027
<i>Let's just try to develop</i>
<i>a thicker skin.</i>

06:36.029 --> 06:37.863
<i>Maybe by spending</i>
<i>more time fishin',</i>

06:37.865 --> 06:40.532
<i>Where only mother nature</i>
<i>can hear you bitchin'.</i>

06:40.534 --> 06:43.368
So come on down to the store...

06:43.370 --> 06:45.871
<i>And grab</i>
<i>one of our donkey dongers.</i>

06:45.873 --> 06:50.175
<i>Okay, that did sound bad.</i>

06:50.177 --> 06:51.576
Oh. Solid vlog, Mike.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.880
What got you thinking
about renaming sports teams?

06:54.882 --> 06:58.049
They want to change the name
of clark elementary school now

06:58.051 --> 07:01.219
Because, all of a sudden,
lewis and clark are bad guys.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.956
You know, nothing lasts, Mike.
We all have to let go.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.958
That's something
I'm learning as I'm --

07:06.960 --> 07:08.393
I'm approaching middle age.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.896
"middle age"?

07:10.898 --> 07:13.432
How long do you expect
to live, Ed?

07:13.434 --> 07:16.268
Until science catches up
with technology,

07:16.270 --> 07:17.536
And then forever.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.572
You know, this
reminds me of something.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.741
Something obscure
and boring, right?
No.

07:22.743 --> 07:25.610
De-stalinization
under the soviets.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.612
Wow, was I ever wrong!

07:28.448 --> 07:29.581
You hold that thought.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.550
Sit there.
I'm gonna get some coffee.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.653
Please. I'll be back.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.988
The city of volgograd
used to be called tsaritsyn,

07:36.990 --> 07:38.990
You know,
after the tsar.
Yeah, I know.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.625
The soviets came in,
shot the tsar,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.294
And renamed
the whole town stalingrad.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.295
Right, then stalin died.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.429
Khrushchev
changed the name back.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.664
Yeah. Right.
So?

07:45.666 --> 07:48.133
Well, it almost
makes you feel bad for stalin.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.167
Yeah, until you remember

07:49.169 --> 07:52.070
That he killed,
like, 20 million people.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.238
Yeah, my point is,
in time,

07:53.240 --> 07:55.407
Everybody gets knocked off
their pedestal.

07:55.409 --> 07:57.309
In 50 years,
will people know who I am?

07:57.311 --> 07:59.344
Nobody knows
who you are <i>now.</i>

07:59.346 --> 08:02.080
Exactly. And I've made
peace with that.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.850
The best legacy
you can leave behind

08:04.852 --> 08:07.185
Is service
to your fellow man.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.187
And as you know,
that's why

08:09.189 --> 08:10.856
I've adopted
this inner-city park.

08:10.858 --> 08:15.026
You know, it's smaller
than I pictured it.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.695
It's my legacy.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.363
Yes, it's all --

08:18.365 --> 08:20.999
All new landscaping
and playground equipment.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.133
And who needs monuments

08:22.135 --> 08:24.035
When you have
sweeping oak trees and --

08:24.037 --> 08:25.871
And the laughter
of grateful children?

08:25.873 --> 08:29.007
And a 90-foot sign

[ chuckling ]
nothing. Nothing.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.473
You can tell me
if I'm doing a bad job, Blanca.

09:01.475 --> 09:05.310
Well, this dress you're making
looks like, uh...

09:05.312 --> 09:07.479
I-I don't know if there's a word
for this in english --

09:07.481 --> 09:10.649
A -- when a dog throws up
and then eats it

09:10.651 --> 09:12.784
And then throws up again.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.924
Do you know anything
about sewing?

09:18.926 --> 09:21.092
Oh, well,
when I was a little girl,

09:21.094 --> 09:22.594
My mother and I
used to sew together

09:22.596 --> 09:24.362
For hours and hours
all day.

09:24.364 --> 09:25.363
Oh, yeah?
That's sweet.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.966
Yeah.
We worked in a sweatshop.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.069
We made clothes
for contempo corner --

09:31.071 --> 09:32.437
You know,
that store in the mall.

09:32.439 --> 09:35.440
And if we ever turned in
a hem that bad --

09:35.442 --> 09:38.610

with a donkey stick.

09:38.612 --> 09:41.179
Blanca, please,
can you teach me?

09:41.181 --> 09:43.682
Listen, everybody
always underestimates me.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.017
But if I could turn in
a dress like this,

09:46.019 --> 09:48.853
Maybe they'd
finally estimate me.

09:48.855 --> 09:52.190
Okay. But you have to do
everything I say, mija.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.526
That means you can't take any
shortcuts or make any excuses.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.627

Yes. But what if I --
you can't.

you won't.

for the los angeles dodgers.

Honey, no! No. Wait!
I told you!

11:36.396 --> 11:38.663
This is too sensitive
to bring up with carol!

I invited her
over here because --

11:40.667 --> 11:42.534

Uh, really, no.
No, I don't.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.347
She thinks
it would be awkward

11:56.349 --> 11:57.716
Because clark
was a slave owner.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.050
What could be awkward

than sitting at home

to take care of your dog.

that slavery was wrong.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.352
I just don't think
a man's mistakes

his accomplishments.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.455
And that
didn't take long.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.358
But it's not just
the slavery issue.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.193
Parents don't like
how clark turned his back

12:42.195 --> 12:43.862
On the native American people.

of how avon barksdale

12:50.637 --> 12:52.537

When we're
laying off teachers.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.476
Now, honey, how would
they handle this on "the wire"?

12:59.945 --> 13:02.614
Usually these controversies,
they burn themselves out.
Right.

as your daughter and son-in-law

he's just a-a guy.

how about this for a compromise?

What if we renamed the school
for -- for meriwether lewis?

you could save your mural.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.698
Oh, gosh! I wasn't
even thinking about that.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.302
And if we renamed it
lewis elementary,

It would give, uh, gay kids
a historic role model.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.973
Meriwether lewis was gay?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.176
There is some research
to suggest that, yeah.

13:31.178 --> 13:35.146
His mom set that table
by naming the kid meriwether.

headed for san francisco?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.954

13:42.956 --> 13:44.956
Yeah, but, I mean, if
we named the school after lewis,

13:44.958 --> 13:46.624
We'd still have to change
the signs.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.294

who is tom c. Clark?

in the '50s?

all this stuff?

a whole world out there.

14:04.444 --> 14:08.112
Oh, well, yeah, justice clark.
You know, he's a safe choice.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.448
There is nothing objectionable
in his record.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.549
Is that
what we're getting to?

14:11.551 --> 14:12.650

After the most boring people
we know?

Hey, chuck, you want
a library named after you?

14:16.323 --> 14:17.655
Mike's right.

14:17.657 --> 14:20.491
We should name the school after
someone who shook things up.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.960
Yeah, preach, brother.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.329

14:27.467 --> 14:30.235
Since half the population
of denver is latino,

14:30.237 --> 14:31.703

before your lewis and clark.

electronic ways to do that now.

just take a minute.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.327
You know, Mike,
I'm actually curious.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.829
Are you really interested
in preserving Vanessa's mural,

17:11.831 --> 17:13.164
Or are you interested
in preserving

17:13.166 --> 17:16.167
Your privileged, white,
euro-centric reading

17:16.169 --> 17:17.735
Of American history?

17:17.737 --> 17:21.172
Well, I like both,
so don't make me pick.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.175
Even carol larabee
agrees with me.

17:24.177 --> 17:27.512
And her ancestors have a bigger
beef with clark than you do.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.881
Carol larabee likes
naming schools after oppressors?

17:29.883 --> 17:32.483
She doesn't like spending money
on trivial stuff.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.486
And that's -- that's unusual
for a bureaucrat <i>and</i> a woman.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.989
Maybe we would have
more of a budget for our schools

17:37.991 --> 17:39.824
If it weren't for
the sequester cuts

17:39.826 --> 17:41.659
That <i>your</i> republican congress
pushed through.

That your president obama
signed.

He is not my guy anymore.
He's not <i>my</i> guy!

17:45.331 --> 17:46.497
Well, I don't want him!

17:46.499 --> 17:49.834
Well, that would explain
his approval ratings.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.002
Look,
I get that you think

17:51.004 --> 17:52.503
This william clark thing
is trivial.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.838
But it is important
to me.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.306
That's how I know
it's trivial.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.709
I just want
the name on my son's school

17:58.711 --> 18:00.211
To be a role model
he can look up to.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.612
You want your kid
to look up to someone?

18:01.614 --> 18:02.780
How about
being a better father?

18:02.782 --> 18:04.182
Oh, yeah, okay.
Here we go again.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.450
I can never
be a great father

18:05.452 --> 18:08.119
Because I ran out on Kristin
and Boyd seven years ago.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.420
I wasn't even gonna
bring that up.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.256
It's about the stupid battle
over this sign, you know.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.624
How about
picking your battles?

18:13.626 --> 18:15.960
Where do we draw the line at?
[ sighs ] hey, buddy.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.464
Did I do something wrong,
daddy?

18:19.466 --> 18:21.299
No, of course not, buddy.
You didn't do anything wrong.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.634
Just...

18:23.636 --> 18:25.937
I should go put on
some pants.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.840
Why don't you find a top
that goes with that skirt?

18:31.276 --> 18:34.946
Did I make everybody mad
with my william clark report?

18:34.948 --> 18:37.281
No, you didn't.
You did great stuff.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.784
It's always good
to be inquisitive.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.785
What's "inquisitive?"

18:40.787 --> 18:42.887
[ chuckles ]
there you go.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.889
So, was william clark
really a bad man?

18:44.891 --> 18:46.557
It's not that simple,
really.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.226
He did a lot of things
that were bad, yes.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.061
But he did some stuff
that made him very important,

18:50.063 --> 18:52.096
Which is why
we're talking about him.

18:52.098 --> 18:55.066
But in the movies there's always
the bad guy and the good guy.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.901
How can you say that?

18:56.903 --> 18:59.303
Didn't we see
"platoon" together?

18:59.305 --> 19:02.840
Nobody's perfect.
Everybody makes mistakes.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.509
Even me.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.177
Did you own slaves?

19:06.179 --> 19:07.845
I didn't have to.
I had kids.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.013
[ chuckles ]

19:09.982 --> 19:13.017
But one time,
I was on my way to catechism,

19:13.019 --> 19:14.252
And I stole a candy bar.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.921
That's bad.
That is bad.

19:16.923 --> 19:20.191
One time I s-- I stole
my dad's bonneville, right?

19:20.193 --> 19:22.360
And I blamed it
on my younger brother.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.861
That's worse.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.997
Look, the point
I'm trying to make

19:25.999 --> 19:28.499
Is I don't want
the bad things in my life

19:28.501 --> 19:32.170
To be the only things
people remember.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.505
I think your dad and I
can agree on that.

19:38.377 --> 19:39.877
This is fun!

19:39.879 --> 19:41.879
Tell me more bad stuff
you did, grandpa.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.882
Well, I traveled a lot
when I first started working.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.351
And I wasn't around for a lot of
the stuff your mom went through

19:47.353 --> 19:49.353
As a little girl,
and I'm not happy about that.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.988
But I wanted to be
an adventurer then.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.024
So you were just like
lewis and clark?

19:53.026 --> 19:54.859
Eh...

19:54.861 --> 19:56.494
More like clark
than lewis.

20:05.337 --> 20:08.406
[ clearing throat ]

20:11.210 --> 20:12.343
Ahem.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.844
You don't need to make
that noise.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.413
We're looking
right at you.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.984
Look out, heidi klum.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.986
Great, so I look like a
40-year-old who's had four kids?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.854
Wow. Thanks, dad.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.490
Okay, so I'm not up
on my supermodels.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.859
Anyway, I am off
to steph's party.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.695
Gonna go show off
my original "Mandy Baxter."

20:30.697 --> 20:31.829
[ sighs ]

20:31.831 --> 20:35.199
Haven't enough guys
seen your Mandy Baxters?

20:35.201 --> 20:37.668
Hey. Hey.
Hey.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.037
Hey, you guys.
How was the p.T.A. Meeting?

20:40.039 --> 20:41.372
Well, you won, dad.

20:41.374 --> 20:45.042
The school is still named
after your hero william clark.

20:45.044 --> 20:49.547
So, like every other p.T.A.
Meeting, nothing happened.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.016
Well, the good news
is my mural is safe.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.719
And now there's more money
for books and crap.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.388
Once Ryan withdrew his petition,
everyone chilled out.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.556
Until your friend Ed
showed up

20:58.558 --> 21:00.224
And started a whole
different fight by donating

21:00.226 --> 21:02.693
Some extra playground equipment
from his park.

21:02.695 --> 21:04.028
Yeah. Well, actually,
that was my idea.

21:04.030 --> 21:06.230
Plan "b" to get everybody
off the name thing.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.732
Hmm, honey,
how did you know

21:07.734 --> 21:09.900
That free monkey bars
would be so controversial?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.069
20% of all broken bones
suffered in kids

21:12.071 --> 21:14.905
Come from monkey bars.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.074
Don't even get him started
on the teeter-totters.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.944
Oh, you mean
the child catapult?

21:19.946 --> 21:22.613
That's how I knew.
I get it.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.948
I'm sorry that, you know,
I want our kid to grow up

21:23.950 --> 21:25.449
With two functioning arms.
Right, of course. Uh-huh.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.784
Should we just wrap Boyd up
in bubble wrap?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.119
It's a cellophane
death machine.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.454
Let's talk about death --
let's talk about bubble wrap.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.490
[ muffled talking ]
