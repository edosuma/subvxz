WEBVTT

00:29.571 --> 00:31.114
Any word of Metron?

00:31.197 --> 00:32.282
Not today, no.

00:32.365 --> 00:34.117
Orion, could we talk?

00:36.411 --> 00:37.704
Yes?

00:37.787 --> 00:39.789
I've been thinking
we got off to a poor start.

00:39.873 --> 00:44.836
I know I reacted badly
to the Ruction Cell incident.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.672
But Vykin
thinks very highly of you,

00:47.756 --> 00:49.758
and I trust Vykin.

00:49.841 --> 00:51.718
So I'd like a chance
to start over.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.720
I would like that as well.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.660
[Ma'alefa'ak]<i> I have</i>
<i>what we need.</i>

01:21.831 --> 01:23.917
[theme music playing]

01:54.489 --> 01:56.449
<i>Metron visited</i>
<i>his Infinity-Vault</i>
<i>two days ago,</i>

01:56.533 --> 01:59.494
<i>depositing something</i>
<i>called a "Ruction Cell."</i>

01:59.577 --> 02:01.704
How did you learn this?

02:01.788 --> 02:05.708
[chuckles]<i> The details</i>
<i>were all on the surface</i>
<i>of the Earther Rocket's mind.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:08.127
<i>She approached me</i>
<i>in my guise as Orion,</i>

02:08.211 --> 02:10.547
<i>hoping to make peace</i>
<i>with the New God,</i>

02:10.630 --> 02:13.049
<i>despite the fact that</i>
<i>she thoroughly distrusts him.</i>

02:13.132 --> 02:16.845
<i>She believes she's simply</i>
<i>making the best</i>
<i>of a bad situation,</i>

02:16.928 --> 02:19.597
<i>having to negotiate</i>
<i>with the Son of Darkseid.</i>

02:19.681 --> 02:23.643
Darkseid's son
has allied himself
with the New Genesians?

02:23.726 --> 02:27.021
How does the Lord of Apokolips
tolerate such disloyalty.

02:29.190 --> 02:32.110
Here. This tracer is attuned
to the Kaizer-Thrall.

02:32.193 --> 02:35.238
-Two days ago, you said?
<i>-Yes, that's the when.</i>

02:35.321 --> 02:37.323
<i>I will show you the where.</i>

02:43.162 --> 02:46.082
Bugs know not
of any Ruction Cell.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.751
[Mountain Foragers]
Ruction cell?
What is a ruction cell?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.920
Can Bugs eat Ruction cell?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.214
[Orion] There's no point
in feigning ignorance.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.384
We know
one of this Hive's Foragers
stole our property.

02:56.467 --> 03:00.430
[All-Widow]
But do not all Foragers
look alike to New Gods?

03:06.978 --> 03:09.480
Now, we'll find out
what this thing can do.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.025
Kaizer-Thrall, lock onto
the tracer's signal...

03:12.108 --> 03:13.276
[beeping, thrumming]

03:25.288 --> 03:27.290
[Dinah]
Hmm, right on time.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.292
Yeah, well,
didn't have much choice.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.837
Black Lightning's policy
requiring annual
mental health check-ins

03:32.921 --> 03:36.841
for members of the League,
Team and Outsiders
basically forced me into this.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.551
And you resent that?

03:38.635 --> 03:42.513
Nah, it makes sense.
For all of us.
Heh, me especially.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.349
Why you especially?

03:44.432 --> 03:45.850
Been a bad boy, right?

03:45.934 --> 03:48.728
A total jerk
at M'gann's intervention.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.647
I've given it
a lot of thought since then,

03:50.730 --> 03:54.025
and the truth is
I needed that reality check.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.485
And I need this, too,

03:55.568 --> 03:57.987
'cause I'm ready
to rejoin the Outsiders.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.280
Huh, that's great.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.282
So I just need
to check off some boxes

04:01.366 --> 04:03.201
to get you cleared
for active duty.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.870
[breathes deeply]
How are you sleeping?

04:05.954 --> 04:08.790
It was a little rough at first,

04:08.873 --> 04:09.999
but I'm doing fine now.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.668
-Well, that's good.
-[pen scratches]

04:11.751 --> 04:14.003
Now, what's this
about quitting<i> Space Trek?</i>

04:14.087 --> 04:19.258
Just prioritizing. I...
I just don't wanna be an actor
when I grow up.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.219
Totally reasonable.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.179
And your relationships?

04:23.262 --> 04:25.098
[sighs]

04:25.181 --> 04:28.059
I've got
some apologizing to do.

04:28.142 --> 04:30.561
But I've got
some great friends.

04:30.645 --> 04:32.897
I think
they'll let me off the hook.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.692
And how are you
handling Conner's death?

04:35.775 --> 04:37.610
Still grieving.

04:38.277 --> 04:39.404
But coping.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.156
I'm honestly
feeling much better.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.702
-All good.
-Yep. All good.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.040
[Rocket grunts in exasperation]
This is getting us nowhere.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.543
After this morning,
I was hoping
we could do better.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.839
I don't know
what about this morning
would make you think that.

04:57.922 --> 05:01.050
And frankly,
I wonder why you
are not more co-operative.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.595
The Justice League hasn't
given any serious consideration
of our request.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.890
You mean your request
to hand over Cyborg and Halo?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.100
Of course.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.893
Both are hybrids
of New God technology

05:10.977 --> 05:13.855
that must not be left
in the hands
of you primitive humans.

05:13.938 --> 05:16.524
Again, that's a non-starter.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.359
Perhaps just Halo then.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.738
As she embodies
a portion of Darksied's
Anti-Life Equation,

05:21.821 --> 05:23.448
you must see
it is in her best interest

05:23.531 --> 05:26.075
to be safeguarded here
by the New Gods.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.661
Halo will be safeguarded
by her family.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.621
A family who loves her.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.665
[sighs] Rocket, see reason--

05:32.749 --> 05:36.002
-The New Gods
withdraw the request.
-We do?

05:36.085 --> 05:37.795
We do.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.424
-Sorry, sorry.
Hate to interrupt--
-Somehow I doubt that.

05:41.507 --> 05:45.720
But I just had to see
my old friends,
Rocket and Forager.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.180
-It's good to see you--
-Forager is most pleased
to see--

05:47.263 --> 05:48.556
C'mere! [grunts]

05:48.639 --> 05:52.602
[chuckles] Bear, this is Flash.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.312
Greetings, new friend, Flash.

05:54.395 --> 05:58.024
Nice to meet you,
but I'll pass
on the bear-hug, uh, Bear.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.318
[laughs] As you wish.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.489
I, um... [clears throat]

06:04.572 --> 06:06.282
Oh, Raquel.

06:06.365 --> 06:10.536
I wanted to offer
my condolences for Superboy.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.039
I loved that kid.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.458
I really did.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.126
Thank you, Bear.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.004
-We all mourn Conner Kent.
-You said it.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.298
Forager
misses Conner Kent greatly.

06:22.381 --> 06:25.176
I heard of Kon-El's death
from Hal Jordan.

06:25.259 --> 06:30.807
It saddens me deeply
that one of the few remaining
genetic Kryptonians has passed.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.434
Particularly a Son of El.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.479
Green Lantern Tomar-Re
knew the El Hive?

06:36.562 --> 06:39.357
Krypton was in my Space-Sector.

06:39.440 --> 06:44.779
And I was good friends
with both the El brothers,
Jor-El and Zor-El.

06:44.862 --> 06:48.950
My single greatest regret
was failing to save Krypton

06:49.033 --> 06:50.827
[sighs] and the House of El.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.505
This way, son.

07:02.588 --> 07:03.840
But stay close.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.759
It doesn't pay
to wander in the Zone.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.803
Is your mind any clearer?

07:08.886 --> 07:10.930
Do you remember
where you are?

07:11.013 --> 07:13.141
-No.
-All right.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.600
Then let's spell it all out.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.854
The Phantom Zone
is a huge void of nothing.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.564
We have nothing here.

07:19.647 --> 07:21.274
Nothing but each other.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.733
It helps to stay together.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.361
That's how you keep
the Zone-Sickness at bay.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.655
Not to mention
the Devourers.

07:27.738 --> 07:30.449
I see you
ran into one of those already.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.951
And, by Rao,

07:32.034 --> 07:34.620
there are worse things
than Devourers here.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.872
[Superman grunts]

07:37.498 --> 07:39.834
That's why
there's safety in numbers.

07:45.798 --> 07:48.759
Come on, my boy.
One more jump.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.261
[both grunt]

07:53.848 --> 07:56.267
I'm back,
and I've brought company.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.863
Let us set
a good example for our guest.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.084
[all groaning]

08:23.502 --> 08:27.924
That journey was unpleasant.

08:30.218 --> 08:31.928
Locked on the tracer's signal.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.768
[Ma'alefa'ak]
<i>That must be the place.</i>

08:38.851 --> 08:40.645
There's Metron.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.939
[Ma'alefa'ak]
<i>Shelving the Ruction Cell.</i>

08:43.022 --> 08:44.649
[Lor-Zod]
We don't need it anymore.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.243
We're now in synch
with this time.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.788
All we have to do is find
the Phantom Zone Projector.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.040
[Ma'alefa'ak]
<i>Oh, that's all we have to do.</i>

09:01.123 --> 09:06.170
Metron's Vault is immense.
Searching will take days.
Maybe weeks.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.005
Then we'd better get started.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.806
[indistinct clicking]

09:16.889 --> 09:18.975
So, how are things
with Perdita?

09:19.058 --> 09:20.518
Are you two reconciling?

09:20.601 --> 09:24.146
No, I-- I mean, yeah.
We hit a rough patch.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.316
All my fault, really.
But I can fix it.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.568
Call her. Tell her I'm sorry.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.404
Give us a chance
to start over.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.323
-Would you like
to call her now?
-No! I-I mean...

09:34.407 --> 09:36.617
I'd want some privacy, right?

09:36.701 --> 09:39.662
Some of our make-up calls
get pretty hot.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.539
Understood.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.500
So, tell me
about the sleeping pills.

09:44.583 --> 09:47.044
[sighs] Nothing to tell now.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.754
I'm not using anymore.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.506
Don't need 'em anymore.

09:50.589 --> 09:53.592
So, you wouldn't mind
taking a drug test
as a formality?

09:53.676 --> 09:57.638
Well, see, I only just
stopped taking them.
Might still be in my system.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.181
If they're still
in your system,

09:59.265 --> 10:01.517
do you really feel ready
to return to the Outsiders?

10:01.600 --> 10:03.019
Look, I know the drill.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.770
I'm managing my symptoms.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.189
-For the short-term
or the long?
-What's the difference?

10:07.273 --> 10:09.817
Short-term solutions,
like pills and distancing,

10:09.900 --> 10:12.653
only postpone
dealing with your issues.

10:12.737 --> 10:14.530
So, what's your
long-term solution?

10:14.613 --> 10:16.741
To get back
with the Outsiders.

10:16.824 --> 10:20.369
Why? You took yourself
off mission-rotation
months ago, didn't you?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.705
That was my choice.
Not yours.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.415
So, you don't really
want to go back.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.709
You just don't want
someone else
taking it away from you.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.587
Yes! No! I--
It doesn't matter.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.422
You can't take away
the Outsiders.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.257
I made that squad.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.759
It's my squad!

10:37.470 --> 10:39.221
I can't lose them.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.474
The way you lost Conner?

10:41.557 --> 10:43.768
Hey, Conner's hanging
with Wally now.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.394
I'm sure they're doing great.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.397
So, this isn't
only about Conner?

10:48.481 --> 10:52.068
But Conner was like
a brother to you, wasn't he?

10:52.151 --> 10:54.070
And his death
truly rocked you, didn't it?

10:54.153 --> 10:56.572
Look, I get it.
I've accepted it.

10:56.655 --> 11:00.076
I know
I'm the reason Conner died.
It's all my fault.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.581
What cannot be saved
cannot be saved.

11:05.664 --> 11:07.416
We should return
to the business at hand.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.253
One minute, Orion.
I wanna talk to friend Forager.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.546
-[grunts]
-So!

11:12.630 --> 11:13.839
I've heard you're spending time

11:13.923 --> 11:16.342
with a Mountain
Hive Forager, huh,

11:16.425 --> 11:17.551
huh? [chuckles]

11:17.635 --> 11:21.055
Yes. In fact, Forager
must decide

11:21.138 --> 11:23.599
whether to return
to Forager's Earth Hive

11:23.682 --> 11:25.351
and Forager's Earth friends

11:25.434 --> 11:28.646
or stay on New Genesis
with Forager.

11:28.729 --> 11:29.730
[Rocket] What?

11:29.814 --> 11:31.524
You've known her
for two days.

11:31.607 --> 11:35.778
Yes. Forager admits
Forager has wasted
considerable time.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.488
Speaking of wasted time...

11:37.571 --> 11:42.118
Understand, Raquel, that Bugs
practice accelerated courtships

11:42.201 --> 11:43.911
relative to humans
or New Gods.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.538
Too true.

11:45.621 --> 11:49.291
[sighs] Dreamer and I
seem to have been courting
forever.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.876
See, I don't get that.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.963
I knew Joan was the one
the moment I laid eyes on her.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.631
I made my move fast.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.842
And that was before
I became the Flash.

11:57.925 --> 12:02.096
I suppose short-lived species
like Bugs and humans
must move fast.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.056
Look, kid, I may not be
a New God,

12:04.140 --> 12:06.392
but I'm not exactly
"short-lived."

12:06.475 --> 12:07.977
I turned 102 yesterday.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.647
A hundred and two?
[stifles chuckle] Impressive.

12:11.730 --> 12:12.815
Why? How old are you?

12:12.898 --> 12:14.400
Well, not very old.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.652
Just a couple decades
over 16,000.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.196
Sixteen thousand... years?

12:19.280 --> 12:20.656
-Well, Earth years.
-[ring beeps]

12:20.739 --> 12:22.658
[automated voice]
<i>Bio-waste recycling initiated.</i>

12:22.741 --> 12:25.411
-[ring beeps]
-Whoops!
Thought I had that on mute.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.288
-Uh, did he just...
-[Kilowog] Sorry.

12:27.371 --> 12:30.374
It's no less appalling
than the rest
of this conversation.

12:30.458 --> 12:36.172
Birthdays, love affairs.
All trivial, of no import.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.718
Please, rise.
All of you.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.471
This way.

12:52.563 --> 12:55.983
<i>We're slow-playing this one,</i>
<i>my love.</i>

12:56.066 --> 13:00.779
Superboy, allow me to introduce
my life-mate, Ursa Zod.

13:00.863 --> 13:04.158
Welcome, um,
Superboy, is it?

13:04.241 --> 13:05.701
And who is this?

13:05.784 --> 13:08.120
I've never seen anyone
of this species.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.998
I don't know her name
or species.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.750
I call her Ghosty.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.210
Where did she come from?

13:14.293 --> 13:16.378
I found her
when I woke up here.

13:16.462 --> 13:18.839
And she's been
unconscious ever since?

13:18.923 --> 13:20.424
Yes.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.260
Odd, I've never known anyone
to be unconscious in the Zone.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.554
All we are is consciousness.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.765
And it's curious
you don't know her.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.726
Look at her burns and yours.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.937
You two must be connected.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.564
Of course, condition
doesn't change here.

13:35.648 --> 13:39.401
We don't age,
we don't die, we don't heal.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.488
So if she was sent here
unconscious,

13:42.571 --> 13:45.032
she may never wake up.

13:45.115 --> 13:47.701
Still, we can care for her.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.078
That's what family does.

13:52.998 --> 13:53.999
Family...

14:00.130 --> 14:01.423
Could it be?

14:01.507 --> 14:02.883
[Ma'alefa'ak]<i> What is it?</i>

14:02.967 --> 14:04.093
Probably nothing.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.345
[chittering, clicking]

14:07.304 --> 14:10.724
[all groaning in pain]

14:20.359 --> 14:21.443
[Lor-Zod]
We have to move.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.320
[chitters]

14:26.156 --> 14:28.450
[grunts] Taking us
out of synch.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.749
[Mantis groans]

14:35.833 --> 14:37.960
What is this red cloud?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.670
I believe it is
a baby Sun-Eater.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.463
Absorbs all heat and energy.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.966
Probably placed in the vault
as security.

14:44.049 --> 14:47.011
[Ma'alefa'ak]<i> It only has</i>
<i>a rudimentary consciousness.</i>

14:47.094 --> 14:49.972
<i>I could stun it</i>
<i>with a brain blast,</i>
<i>but briefly.</i>

14:50.055 --> 14:51.890
Well, I can't punch a cloud.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.393
And my heat vision
would only feed it
the solar energy it craves.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.812
There's nothing solid
for the Kaizer-Thrall
to latch onto,

14:56.895 --> 14:58.647
and Mantis sure as Rao
can't do anything.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.816
-[growls in frustration]
-[Lor-Zod]
But this changes nothing.

15:00.899 --> 15:02.693
We must continue our search
for the Projector.

15:02.776 --> 15:06.989
[Ma'alefa'ak scoffs]
<i>While dodging this creature.</i>

15:07.072 --> 15:09.658
You think you're responsible
for Conner's death?

15:09.742 --> 15:12.036
-I know I am.
-Okay.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.747
-Let's examine that.
-Review my 'Trauma Narrative?'

15:14.830 --> 15:19.376
So, you know the drill.
I wasn't there, you were.
Take me through it.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.211
Tell me how you killed Conner.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.713
I knew he was weakened.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.507
Low oxygen.
Solar cells not charged.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.010
And I left him there alone
to deal with the bomb.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.387
But it was the Kryptonite
that killed him,

15:30.471 --> 15:32.097
-did you know about that?
-No.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.349
But if I make him leave,

15:33.432 --> 15:35.184
he never gets hit
with the Kryptonite.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.687
But if he's not there,
what happens
to all the Martians?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.648
Nothing if I disarm
the bomb first!

15:40.731 --> 15:42.483
Did you know how to do that?

15:42.566 --> 15:45.778
Could you have taken it
into the lava
to destroy the virus?

15:46.528 --> 15:47.988
And M'gann?

15:48.072 --> 15:50.199
She let Conner
stay with the bomb, too.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.076
Is she to blame
for his death?

15:52.159 --> 15:54.370
What? No!
She loved Conner!

15:54.453 --> 15:56.205
And you didn't?

15:56.288 --> 15:59.166
Conner's
not the first loved one
you've lost.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.794
Last year, you and I
talked about losing Brion--

16:01.877 --> 16:04.797
-Brion's not dead.
-No, but we've lost him.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.590
Do you feel responsible
for that, too?

16:06.674 --> 16:09.551
I was his squad leader.
I should've seen the signs.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.428
You mentioned Wally earlier.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.305
Are you to blame
for his death, too?

16:13.389 --> 16:15.474
I could've gone
with Miss Martian
to the North Pole.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.226
-And Rita?
-I should've been with her

16:17.309 --> 16:18.811
on that last
Doom Patrol mission.

16:18.894 --> 16:20.979
-And your mother?
-I should've stopped
Queen Bee!

16:21.063 --> 16:22.856
Gar, you were eight years old.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.401
The combined might
of the Team
and the Justice League

16:25.484 --> 16:27.569
still hasn't stopped
Queen Bee.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.113
How is an eight-year-old child

16:29.196 --> 16:31.073
-supposed to do that?
-[cries]

16:31.156 --> 16:33.409
[voice breaking]
I could've done something.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.119
What?

16:35.202 --> 16:37.162
What could you
have done differently
to save any of them?

16:37.246 --> 16:40.749
I don't know.
I just needed to be better.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.584
They needed me to be better.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.919
Don't you see?

16:44.002 --> 16:46.046
Even when we do
everything right,

16:46.130 --> 16:48.632
bad things
still sometimes happen.

16:48.716 --> 16:52.052
There are some things
we have the power to control,

16:52.136 --> 16:53.470
but the hardest thing to admit,

16:53.554 --> 16:56.265
especially for people
in our line of work

16:56.348 --> 16:58.684
is that sometimes, we're...

16:58.767 --> 17:00.728
Powerless.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.355
[grunts]
But I don't wanna be...

17:03.439 --> 17:04.565
I should've...

17:04.648 --> 17:05.983
They shouldn't have...

17:06.066 --> 17:08.318
I should have stopped
it all, somehow.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.404
-How?
-I don't know.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.864
I don't know.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.409
Dinah...

17:15.492 --> 17:17.161
I need help.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.662
Admitting that...

17:18.746 --> 17:20.622
It's a start, Gar.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.542
A real start.

We will keep you
in this condition indefinitely

even simple communication

19:12.609 --> 19:14.236

move or not

19:14.319 --> 19:16.280
