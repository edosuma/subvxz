WEBVTT

00:00.735 --> 00:04.003
- Thank you for joining me
for what promises to be

00:04.005 --> 00:06.505
The diggity-dopest tree lighting
in the history of the nine-nine.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.140
- I don't understand.
Where's the tree?

00:08.141 --> 00:10.442
- It was inside us all along.
Brilliant, Jake.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.644
- No, Charles, not everything
was inside of us all along.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.381
The tree is right here.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.782
- Cool.
Can we go now?

00:16.784 --> 00:18.617
- Obviously not.
Behold,

00:18.619 --> 00:22.287
The greatest inflatable tree
that 'murica has to offer.

00:22.289 --> 00:25.224
And now, in the immortal words
of saint nick,

00:25.226 --> 00:26.658
Turn on the compressor.

00:28.629 --> 00:31.196
You hear that?
It's the sound of Christmas.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.631
- It's deafening.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.400
- It's getting really big.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.768
What size tree did you get?

00:35.770 --> 00:37.236
- It's a jumbo.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.271
- It says it's ten meters tall.

00:39.273 --> 00:42.274
That's...
- roughly 32.81 feet.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.410
Someone unplug it,
unplug it now.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.445
- We can't.
It swallowed its own plug!

00:46.447 --> 00:48.547
- Everybody run!

00:52.520 --> 00:54.319
- Okay,
the tree has been contained.

00:54.321 --> 00:55.654
- Wait, we left a man behind.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.123
- Jake!

00:58.125 --> 01:01.060
- Well, terry's trapped
in the break room forever.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.628
Only thing we can do now
is move on with our lives.

01:02.630 --> 01:03.762
It's what terry would've wanted.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.665
- Aah!

01:10.538 --> 01:12.471
- God bless us, every one?

01:12.473 --> 01:13.539
- Yeah!

01:13.541 --> 01:14.773
Yeah!

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074

01:34.728 --> 01:37.863
- Ah, the Boyles are here.
Good tidings.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.331
Genevieve, hello,
you're looking...

01:39.333 --> 01:40.666
- Sexy as a minx.

01:40.668 --> 01:42.367
- I was gonna say "festive,"
due to the scarf.

01:42.369 --> 01:44.770
- The bra underneath is insane.

01:44.772 --> 01:46.038
- It is.
- Okay.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.305
Parenthood has not changed
you two.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.440
Hey there, Nikolaj, my man.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.242
How you doing?
- Hi, Jake, we made daddy

01:50.244 --> 01:52.511
Latvian Christmas cookies.
Want one?

01:52.513 --> 01:54.446
- You bet I do.
- The potato really

01:54.448 --> 01:55.848
Brings out the vinegar.
- Neither of those

01:55.850 --> 01:57.516
Are cookie things.
I'm just gonna put that back.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.251
So, you excited for Christmas,
bud?

01:59.253 --> 02:01.453
- Yeah, I'm so excited.
- This is Nikolaj's

02:01.455 --> 02:04.289
First Christmas because the
orphanage kept canceling it.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.259
Once it was blizzards, one it
was fires, and once it was...

02:07.261 --> 02:08.794
- Famine.
- That's right, famine.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.329
- Oh.
- Papa promised me

02:10.330 --> 02:13.565
A captain Latvia action figure!

02:13.567 --> 02:16.502
- Whoa, captain Latvia?
What's his superpower?

02:16.504 --> 02:19.138
Can he talk to moose?
- No, possums.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.639
- Worse.
- It's a very difficult toy

02:20.641 --> 02:22.307
To get in America,
so I was worried

02:22.309 --> 02:24.476
When Charles told Nikolaj
he would get him one.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.478
I said, keep it a surprise,
so you don't build up

02:26.480 --> 02:28.747
His expectations,
but Charles said, "no way",

02:28.749 --> 02:30.816
I want to build expectations."
- well, we all remember

02:30.818 --> 02:33.218
The conversation.
Well, work time for daddy.

02:33.220 --> 02:35.888
I'll see you guys later.
Okay, I love you guys so much.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.156
- Love you.
- All right.

02:37.158 --> 02:39.391
- Bye.
- Christmas is gonna be amazing!

02:39.393 --> 02:41.393
Christmas is gonna suck.
I don't have the present.

02:41.395 --> 02:42.728
- What?
But you promised Nikolaj.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.164
- I ordered it a month ago
from a Latvian toy store,

02:45.166 --> 02:46.565
And it still hasn't arrived yet.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.500
The shipping company is
giving me the runaround.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.668
- All right, so just get him
a different present,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.537
Like a jet ski or... A hammer.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.638
I don't know what kids are into.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.173
- Genevieve and I worked so hard

02:54.175 --> 02:56.508
To get Nikolaj to trust us
when we brought him home.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.377
That's gonna be destroyed,

02:58.379 --> 03:00.312
The way dry rot
destroyed his orphanage.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.347
- Trust me, it's gonna be fine.
- Really?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.816
'Cause you said that
about "die hard 5," Jake.

03:06.253 --> 03:07.586
- Oh.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.454
It's not gonna be fine.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.924
- Finally, let's talk about
community outreach.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.525
Does anyone have
any ideas about...

03:13.527 --> 03:18.664
* fa-la-la-la-la,
la la la la *

03:18.666 --> 03:20.933
- Who are these
golden-throated dorks?

03:20.935 --> 03:22.501
- It's the MTA.
- That's right.

03:22.503 --> 03:24.436
The metropolitan
transit authority.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.572
- I assumed you've climbed out
of your rat tunnels

03:26.574 --> 03:29.308
To taunt us about tonight's
charity caroling competition.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.709
- No, no, no, of course not.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.945
We're here to wish you luck,
since every year we...

03:32.947 --> 03:34.713
* kick... *
- * your *

03:34.715 --> 03:36.248
* butts *

03:36.250 --> 03:38.650
- Enough.
You may have bested us before,

03:38.652 --> 03:40.719
But throttle back
your ambitions.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.487
Our voices are...

03:42.489 --> 03:43.989
- * better? *
- * awesome *

03:43.991 --> 03:46.425
- * sing! *
- * Scully! *

03:46.427 --> 03:47.559
- That was terrible.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.827
I hope you're more prepared
tonight,

03:48.829 --> 03:50.462
Or else we'll have to file
a missing persons report.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.364
"Your."

03:52.366 --> 03:53.532
"dignity."
- mm.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.467
- Come on, crew,
let's hit the rails and buses.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.401
Both great ways
to get around the city.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.738
- I hate that we lose to those

03:59.740 --> 04:01.473
Pasty-assed mole people
every year.

04:01.475 --> 04:02.975
- Oh, there's no point in
mincing your words.

04:02.977 --> 04:04.409
They're knaves!

04:04.411 --> 04:06.545
- Captain, you kiss Kevin
with that mouth?

04:06.547 --> 04:08.380
- You bet I do.
And tonight,

04:08.382 --> 04:09.881
I'm gonna sing with it.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.718
We're taking down the MTA.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.690
- Charles, what are you doing?
- Jah-nakeh.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.709
- What?
- Jah-keh.

04:21.711 --> 04:23.728
- No idea what you're saying.
Why aren't you wearing a jacket?

04:23.731 --> 04:25.330
Oh, jacket, got it.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.567
Aw, it's freezing.
What are you doing out here?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.969
- I'm on the phone
with Melvin's import-exports,

04:30.971 --> 04:32.838
The bastards who lost
my captain Latvia.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.673
Now wrap me in your arms,
I need body heat.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.008
All right.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.943
- And you're nestling.
- Ugh, first those jerks said

04:37.945 --> 04:39.945
They lost my package,
then they said they found it,

04:39.947 --> 04:41.613
Then they had me on hold
for three hours.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.448
This is the only place
I get reliable reception.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.550
- I'm unwrapping for a sec.
- No, why?

04:45.552 --> 04:47.853
- 'Cause I need my fingers
to save the day

04:47.855 --> 04:49.588
Like a fricking hero.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.758
And... Boom.
Melvin's import is in queens.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.526
Let's just go there right now.
- Oh, so they could just

04:54.528 --> 04:56.662
Walk all over me in person
instead of on the phone?

04:56.664 --> 04:58.764
Face it, Jake, I'm weak.
- What? Don't talk like that.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.300
You're very strong, all right?
And you're a parent now,

05:01.302 --> 05:02.334
Which makes you even stronger.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.602
I mean, think about
all those moms

05:03.604 --> 05:05.637
Who literally lift buses
off their kids every day.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.539
- Oh, so you're saying I should

05:07.541 --> 05:08.974
Tap into my mommy strength.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.776
- Yeah, or daddy strength,
but whatever.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.512
- Right, time to put some daddy
into my mommy.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.580
- Gotta be a better way
to phrase that, let's go.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.416
- Okay, let's review
our simple harmonies.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.885
When I point at you,
hit your note.

05:19.887 --> 05:23.822
- * la *
- * la *

05:23.824 --> 05:25.590
- * la *

05:25.592 --> 05:29.361
* la *

05:29.363 --> 05:31.396
- Okay.
That was horrible.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.964
- Because I didn't
get a chance to rap.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.966
* pop, pop, droppin' bodies *

05:34.968 --> 05:35.967
* it's a stickup
you punk a... *

05:35.969 --> 05:37.836
- No, Hitchcock,
there's no rapping.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.638
You've grossly misread
the situation.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.106
- Maybe we just need to
practice more.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.475
I, for one, felt like
I was a teeny bit off.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.576
- Don't fool yourself, Santiago.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.111
You were the most off
of everyone.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.714
- That's enough.
Sure, we're untrained.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.450
Yes,
our voices sound like garbage,

05:51.452 --> 05:53.919
And, yes, the MTA has
a huge head start on us,

05:53.921 --> 05:55.587
And it's embarrassing.

05:55.589 --> 05:56.822
But you know what?

05:56.824 --> 05:59.057
We're the nine-nine.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.860
And nothing can stand
in our way.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.961
- She's right.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.696
We're gonna beat their butts
tonight.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.697
- Oh, tonight?

06:05.699 --> 06:06.698
Tonight, tonight?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.400
Yeah, I can't.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.101
I have "Hamilton" tickets.
Oh, well.

06:10.104 --> 06:11.136
Good luck.
Peace.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.771
- I'm out too.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.473
I mean, if we're just gonna
be humiliated, I don't s...

06:14.475 --> 06:15.741
Wait, shut up.
- Did you just tell

06:15.743 --> 06:17.976
Yourself to shut up?
- Yeah, now you shut up too.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.778
- Listen.
- * mother and child... *

06:19.780 --> 06:22.414
- You hear that?
- It's an angel

06:22.416 --> 06:24.015
Who will save us.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.617
- * tender and mild... *

06:25.619 --> 06:27.452
- It's coming from the bullpen.

06:27.454 --> 06:31.523
- * sleep in heavenly peace *

06:31.525 --> 06:32.724
- Who's singing?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.126
Is it one of
the uniformed officers?

06:34.128 --> 06:35.927
- No, it is not.

06:35.929 --> 06:39.097
- * heavenly peace *

06:39.099 --> 06:42.000
- Our angel's a criminal.
- And our angel is drunk.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.505
The angel puked.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.508
- Hey, you Melvin?
- I am, who are you?

06:49.510 --> 06:52.978
- I'm Charles, from being
on hold, and I want my package.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.980
- Yeah, I already told you,
that package isn't here.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.981
- Well, I made a sacred promise
to my son, and you're not

06:56.984 --> 07:00.152
Gonna make a liar out of me, so
why don't you take another look?

07:00.154 --> 07:04.423
We'll wait.
'cause we've got all...

07:04.425 --> 07:07.959
Night... Long.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.594
- Damn.
- Oh, I don't know

07:09.596 --> 07:11.530
If you knew this,
but... I'm a cop.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.832
So maybe this time,
don't lie to me.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.500
- Hey, I didn't know
you guys were police.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.136
- Well, now you do, genius.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.206
- How do you keep doing that?
- I don't know.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.074
- All right, all right, hold on.
Look, there's a Latvian gang,

07:23.076 --> 07:25.510
Okay, the gals skepu.
They smuggle guns

07:25.512 --> 07:26.845
In containers
that come from Latvia.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.680
Sometimes there's
other packages that get lost

07:28.682 --> 07:30.816
In the process, okay?
If you want to find yours,

07:30.818 --> 07:33.084
You gotta find them.
- Gun-running gangsters, huh?

07:33.086 --> 07:35.754
- Well, looks like we're
gonna take down the Latvian mob.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.989
- Hell yeah, we are.

07:37.991 --> 07:41.460
Is it bleeding?

07:41.462 --> 07:42.661
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Charles, is it bleeding?

07:42.662 --> 07:44.142
- Thanks, Melvin.
- I want a band-aid.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.966
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.634
- I just talked to Crawford
from organized crime.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.603
Apparently, the gals skepu
are major gun-runners

07:51.605 --> 07:52.938
On the east coast.
Their leader's got

07:52.940 --> 07:55.173
An office in the back.
Also, great chest hair.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.676
- Ah, Genevieve calls it
"the plume of Boyle."

07:57.678 --> 07:59.077
- Aww, that's so yucky.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.179
Hey, do you think
this shirt is offensive?

08:01.181 --> 08:03.048
I'm just not sure
how it fits into my ensemble.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.049
- Come on, focus, Jake.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.017
My boy's happiness is at stake.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.953
I mean, read the email
Genevieve just sent me.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.254
Skip the part about her bra.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.056
- Impossible,
it's in all caps, bolded.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.858
- Oh.
- "Nik-Nik is so"

08:12.860 --> 08:14.693
Excited you're getting him
captain Latvia."

08:14.695 --> 08:16.828
And then there's a photo of him
karate chopping a cat.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.698
- Oh, yeah, that's captain
Latvia's move, the Riga hammer.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.633
You hit a guy here,
he goes down instantly.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.235
- Sounds a little far-fetched.
- Okay, well, tell that

08:23.237 --> 08:25.537
To captain Latvia's enemies.
Oh, wait, you can't

08:25.539 --> 08:27.772
Because they're unconscious.
- Okay, the door is guarded

08:27.774 --> 08:29.574
By the mob.
You wanna figure out our plan?

08:29.576 --> 08:30.976
- Already did.

08:30.978 --> 08:33.245
Mommy's gonna talk her way in.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.682
Hey there, jokers.
I got a joke for you:

08:37.683 --> 08:41.720
What did one Estonian farmer
say to the other?

08:41.722 --> 08:44.589
Our crop yields
are so much smaller

08:44.591 --> 08:47.158
Than that of mighty Latvia.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.536
- Okay.
Come on in.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.171
- Oh, laughing is fun.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.008
- The question on the table is,
do we add a velvet-voiced

09:03.010 --> 09:06.678
Drunkard to our caroling group,
or do we lose miserably like

09:06.680 --> 09:08.980
A bunch of miserable losers?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.182
I say we do it,
and I'm the boss.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.184
Therefore, meeting adjourned.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.221
- I can't believe you're even
considering this, captain.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.722
The guy's a criminal.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.858
- Barely.
It was public intoxication.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.127
All he did was pee on
a couple snowmen.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.328
And one regular man.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.597
- Plus, it'll count toward
his community service.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.866
In a certain way,
we'll be furthering

09:27.868 --> 09:29.200
The cause of justice.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.636
- Santiago, breaking the rules
makes you all sweaty.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.972
You can't be okay with this.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.274
- These pits are bone-dry.
The drunk sings.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.810
- The drunk sings.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.947
- Thank you very much.
Did you unbutton another button?

09:41.949 --> 09:44.082
- Eyes up here, Jake.
So, did you learn anything,

09:44.084 --> 09:46.618
Or were you just staring at
my body the whole time?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.887
- Weird, but I did find out
who the manager is,

09:48.889 --> 09:50.589
And I'm almost positive
she's got a key to

09:50.591 --> 09:51.756
The back office on her
right now.

09:51.758 --> 09:52.824
Her name is Svetlana.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.893
- Thanks.
I'll take it from here.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.728
- Wait, Charles,
she doesn't speak any English,

09:56.730 --> 09:58.129
And we don't wanna
blow our cover.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.231
Do you speak any Latvian?
- Well, I learned a few phrases

10:00.233 --> 10:04.102
For Nikolaj, but I'm not
gonna use words with Svetlana.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.670
- Don't say you're
gonna use your musk.

10:05.672 --> 10:08.006
- I'm gonna use my musk.
- Okay.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.144
It's a pretty juicy crowd
out there.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.879
Okay, everyone,
remember your role.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.315
Patrick, solos.
Scully, mouth percussion.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.718
Rosa, mouth percussion.
Amy, silent mouth percussion...

10:19.720 --> 10:20.852
- I can't even mouth percuss?

10:20.854 --> 10:22.621
- No.
Terry, mouth percussion.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.090
Hitchcock... Stay backstage.
- You got it.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.993
- We walk out one by one,
bum-bum-bumming,

10:27.995 --> 10:30.095
Then Patrick sings us
to victory.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.063
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together for</i>

10:32.065 --> 10:33.732
<i>"the 99th precinct."</i>

10:35.985 --> 10:38.235
* bum, bum, bum bum, bum, bum *

10:38.238 --> 10:43.174
* bum, bum, buuum *

10:45.812 --> 10:47.746
- Now, Patrick.
Now.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.248
- Mm-mm.
Mm-mm, no, too many people.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.950
Too many.

10:53.687 --> 10:55.186
- Sir, say something.

10:55.188 --> 10:58.923
- I'm sorry, but there's been
a police emergency.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.759
There's a bomb.

11:01.928 --> 11:05.263
Not here, far away,
but they still need us.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.232
So... Merry Christmas.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.702
And... Don't think about
the bomb.

11:10.704 --> 11:11.870
Bye.

11:11.872 --> 11:15.740
- That sounded great.
- Not now, Hitchcock.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.142
What the hell happened
out there, Patrick?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.344
- I'm really sorry.
There were so many people.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.046
I-I got stage fright.
- I don't get it.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.381
You had no problem singing
in front of the entire precinct.

11:23.383 --> 11:24.683
- I was drunk.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.384
Alcohol gives me
the courage to sing.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.253
- And the courage to
pee on snow people.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.388
- Well, well, well.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.790
I made a couple calls,

11:31.792 --> 11:33.692
And imagine my surprise
when I found out

11:33.694 --> 11:36.361
That the only bomb out there
was you guys.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.830
- Yeah, well, it looks like
the only train in here

11:38.832 --> 11:40.799
Is the train.
- Tell him, Amy.

11:40.801 --> 11:44.102
- Train, training,
training wheels.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.004
- You're circling,
find it, find it.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.039
- Wheels!
You are wheels.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.174
- Nope.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.149
- Fantastic dancer.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.289
Wow, Boyle, you got more moves
than bobby Fischer

12:04.291 --> 12:06.124
Who I saw a documentary
about last week.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.926
- Flattery will get you
everywhere, Jake.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.861
Follow me.
I figure we got 15 minutes

12:09.863 --> 12:11.129
Before the pheromones wear off,

12:11.131 --> 12:12.497
And she realizes I took the key.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.866
I was spraying 'em
like a skunk out there.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.134
- Ugh.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.969
I got nothing.
No shipping records,

12:17.971 --> 12:19.471
No addresses,
nothing about illegal guns,

12:19.473 --> 12:20.905
And nothing about
captain Latvia.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.273
- Well, they're obviously
not gonna broadcast

12:22.275 --> 12:24.008
What they did with
captain Latvia.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.660
They're not fools.
- We should go.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.311
We've been here too long.
This is getting dangerous.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.447
- Well, danger is
my maiden name.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.282
- Middle name.
- So you better keep looking,

12:31.284 --> 12:33.418
Because I'm not gonna
let my kid down, not tonight.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.019
- Ugh.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.287
Crap, we've got company.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.455
I told you we had to leave.

12:37.457 --> 12:40.024
- I found a tablet.
This could be something.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.993
- Hey, thank god you're here.

12:41.995 --> 12:43.435
Do you think
this shirt is offensive?

12:44.531 --> 12:45.530
- Do the Riga hammer.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.865
- But that's not a real thing.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.099
Ahh!

12:48.101 --> 12:49.434
Jake!

12:52.272 --> 12:53.438
- Oh, you wanna
do this in Latvian?

12:53.440 --> 12:54.539
Fine.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.348
Oh!

13:06.286 --> 13:07.319
- What were you guys
talking about?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.640
Did he think
the shirt was racist?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.458
So, pretty crazy how you

13:13.460 --> 13:15.059
Took out that Latvian
mob guy back there.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.262
- I know, I felt like a
superhero, like the hulk's mom.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.464
- Why the mom?
- Hey, is there anything

13:19.466 --> 13:21.299
On that tablet that will
lead us to his toy?

13:21.301 --> 13:23.134
- I don't know, it's locked,
but don't worry.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.836
Our tech guys will
get it open in no time.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.337
- Pssh, I don't have time
for those dorks.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.939
- What?
But you love ted and Craig.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.174
You fly kites with them
every weekend.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.441
- They're good guys.
Give me the damn tablet!

13:30.443 --> 13:31.910
- What?
No, Charles, you're driving.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.312
- Ugh.
1234? Nope.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.281
5555? Damn it.
- Stop.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.582
If you keep getting it wrong,
we're gonna get

13:37.584 --> 13:40.985
Locked out forever.
- That's a risk I have to take.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.922
Boom, did it, 5683.
Fifth most common

13:43.924 --> 13:45.456
Pass code this year.
It spells...

13:45.458 --> 13:47.158
"love."
- "fart." yep, "love."

13:47.160 --> 13:48.760
- Now find me something
I could use.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.361
- Never thought I'd have to say
"a please would be nice,"

13:50.363 --> 13:52.096
But okay.
Oh, here we go.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.331
There are a bunch of messages

13:53.333 --> 13:54.866
About a warehouse
in crown heights.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.201
- Crown heights,
that's where we're going.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.069
Hey, Charles,

13:58.071 --> 14:01.239
That was a yellow light!
- I proceeded with caution.

14:01.241 --> 14:05.176
* glory to the new born king *

14:05.178 --> 14:08.179
- Those MTA jerks just texted us
a gif of a cartoon

14:08.181 --> 14:11.149
Subway train mooning a cop.
They sent it from the stage.

14:11.151 --> 14:13.017
- We cannot let this stand.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.285
But there's no way
we can beat them.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.386
What do we do?

14:15.388 --> 14:16.454
- My rapping's
still on the table.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.189
- It's not even
in the dining room.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.058
We need a new singer.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.392
- I hate to say this,

14:21.394 --> 14:23.361
But I think we should withdraw
from the competition.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.129
- Smart, then we can sit
in the audience

14:25.131 --> 14:27.098
And throw batteries
at those MTA-holes.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.601
- Guys, personally,
I think we should go out there

14:29.603 --> 14:31.002
And just sing our best.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.437
Caroling isn't about competing.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.972
It's about having fun together.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.139
- Well, now that you put it
that way, Scully,

14:35.141 --> 14:37.609
It makes me realize
Rosa and terry are right.

14:37.611 --> 14:39.377
I say we quit the competition

14:39.379 --> 14:41.346
And hurl projectiles at the MTA.

14:41.348 --> 14:42.480
- What's up, y'all?

14:42.482 --> 14:44.415
Guess who just saved your asses?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.301
That's right.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.186
Miss not good enough
to audibly percuss.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.521
- Who?
- Me! I saved the flipping day.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.123
Got Patrick drunk, listen.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.058
- * I can sing *

14:54.060 --> 14:55.994
- Are you serious, Santiago?

14:55.996 --> 14:57.629
That is ethically questionable.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.265
Ugh.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.967
It's a bus pooping on
a police car.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.669
Let's beat those bastards.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.638
- Okay,
this looks like the place.

15:06.640 --> 15:08.506
Now, let's get in there
and take down some bad boys.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.275
- Hell yes, let's do that,
in 10 minutes

15:10.277 --> 15:12.110
After backup arrives,
and not until then.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.979
- Look, I want this to be
a very special day for Nikolaj.

15:14.981 --> 15:16.514
- There's a gang
of armed men in there,

15:16.516 --> 15:17.982
And we've done zero recon.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.350
I won't let you go in,
I mean it.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.920
- All right.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.688
We'll wait for back up.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.056
- Great, thank you.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.500
- Only I'm not waiting.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.202
- What?
Charles, no.

15:38.204 --> 15:42.040
Charles, stop scooching.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.508
- I am going to scooch.
You don't tell me

15:43.510 --> 15:45.610
When to scooch.
- I can't get by.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.379
Curse my beautiful bubble butt.
- See, all Boyle men are blessed

15:48.381 --> 15:50.682
With a flat ass,
which is perfect for scooching.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.617
- Why are you acting this way?
- 'cause I made a promise

15:52.619 --> 15:54.252
To my son.
You can't understand 'cause

15:54.254 --> 15:56.020
You're not a father.
You never will be.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.655
- Hey, yes, I will!
- When, Jake?

15:57.657 --> 15:58.656
We're all waiting.

15:58.658 --> 15:59.991
- What are we even
arguing about now?

15:59.993 --> 16:02.060
- It's about me
saving Christmas, duh.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.062
Oh, damn it,
my pants are snagged,

16:04.064 --> 16:06.097
- Ha-hah!
Now you have to wait for backup.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.498
- No, I don't.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.535
I'm gonna shimmy them off.

16:10.537 --> 16:13.538
- Oh, god, the eye contact
is the worst part.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.208
- Ah.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.743
I told you, Jake.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.712
I'll do anything
to perk up my little man.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.715
- You gotta know how gross
that sounds in your underwear.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.150
- Thank you for
allowing us to return.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.552
Turns out there wasn't a bomb.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.655
It was a clock made by an
over-achieving minority student.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.090
What a world we live in.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.491
Now let's sing.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.664
* bum, bum, bum.
Bum, bum, bum. *

16:39.666 --> 16:44.102
* bum, bum, buuum *

16:44.104 --> 16:48.206
- * joy to the world,
the lord is come *

16:48.208 --> 16:52.143
- * let earth receive her king *

16:52.145 --> 16:54.479
- * let everyone *

16:54.481 --> 16:56.781
* eat my farts *

16:58.218 --> 17:01.119
Yeah, I said it.
New york city sucks.

17:01.121 --> 17:03.287
Hoboken for life!
Whoo!

17:06.126 --> 17:08.226
- Can't talk right now, Jake.
I'm a busy little bee.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.394
<i>- Wait, wait, wait.
Don't hang up.</i>

17:09.396 --> 17:10.795
<i>Just tell me what's going on</i>

17:10.797 --> 17:12.597
<i>So I know where to send
backup when it arrives.</i>

17:12.598 --> 17:14.365
- Uh, I'm north
of the loading bay.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.501
I have eyes on the shipment.
There are only ten guys.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.202
<i>- Only?
That's too many guys.</i>

17:18.204 --> 17:19.404
- They're removing guns.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.039
All right, they're taking
the other boxes...

17:21.040 --> 17:22.339
Oh, no, they're burning them.
They're gonna

17:22.342 --> 17:24.375
Burn captain Latvia.
I have to go right now.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.344
<i>- It's too risky.
They have a ton of weapons.</i>

17:26.346 --> 17:27.678
- Doesn't matter.
I'm going in there,

17:27.680 --> 17:29.647
And no one can stop me.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.584
The Riga hammer.
It works.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.789
- Ugh, where am I?

17:37.791 --> 17:39.524
Why the hell am I wearing pants?

17:39.526 --> 17:42.560
- Oh, I put 'em back on you
after I Riga hammered you.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.429
Yeah, it works.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.696
Insane.
- Oh...

17:45.698 --> 17:48.099
- Look, I couldn't let you
go in there solo.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.201
I'm sorry, I feel terrible
for saving your life.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.636
- Enough of your dumb apologies,
Jake.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.571
Swat's here, we have to
move on these guys now.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.106
- No, Charles, you
know what I realized

17:55.108 --> 17:56.174
When I saw you
standing over there

17:56.176 --> 17:57.341
In your underwear?

17:57.343 --> 17:58.676
- That my butt is like
a sexy piece of drywall?

17:58.678 --> 18:00.411
- What?
No, eww.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.247
- You guys gonna be much longer?
It's Christmas eve.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.082
- Just give us one sec, Marv.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.483
No, what I realized is,
the best gift

18:05.485 --> 18:07.685
You can give Nikolaj
is not captain Latvia.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.687
- What?
- It's you, being there

18:09.689 --> 18:12.356
With him, alive.
- But I promised him...

18:12.358 --> 18:14.136
- Yeah, but you
also promised him

18:14.137 --> 18:15.915
You were gonna be his father.
- I'm worried

18:15.916 --> 18:17.694
We're gonna lose tactical.
- Back off, Marv, we get it.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.297
- Come on, Marvin.
- Look, we can handle this

18:19.299 --> 18:21.666
Without you... just go home.
- Thanks, Jake.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.534
And I'm sorry I said
you'll never be a dad.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.770
You will be, and you can
make it happen tonight.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.306
Just go to Amy and make sure
afterwards that she holds

18:28.308 --> 18:29.373
Her knees to her chest
for at least...

18:29.375 --> 18:30.641
- All right,
I think I'm good on this.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.643
- Okay.
- Yeah.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.882
All right, Marv,

18:37.884 --> 18:38.883
Be honest with me.

18:38.885 --> 18:40.218
What do you think of this shirt?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.452
- It's a little inappropriate.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.887
- I knew it.
All right,

18:42.889 --> 18:44.689
Let's just go on three.
Ready?

18:44.691 --> 18:47.758
One, two, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.161
- Once again,
the MTA has bested us.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.296
We should never have trusted
a Hoboken drunk.

18:52.298 --> 18:56.667
- "Hamilton" was amazing!

18:56.669 --> 18:58.536
How is no one talking about
this musical?

18:58.538 --> 19:00.304
It's so good.

19:00.306 --> 19:04.442
Wow, you guys look more upset
than Aaron burr, sir.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.743
That's from the musical
"Hamilton,"

19:05.745 --> 19:07.512
Which I just discovered,
basically.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.213
- We lost the caroling
competition.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.448
- And now we hate singing.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.383
- Almost as much as
we hate the MTA.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.218
- Yeah, so we should prank call
their tip line

19:14.220 --> 19:15.820
With a series of
well-crafted insults.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.356
- We should toilet paper
their houses.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.925
- With rocks.
- Come on, guys.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.661
Getting back at people isn't
what Christmas is all about.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.663
It's about being together,
as a family.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.432
So you can plot your petty
revenge, but I, for one,

19:28.434 --> 19:31.435
Am gonna carol my heart out.

19:31.437 --> 19:33.171
- I'm sorry, I didn't hear
a word you just said.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.339
That stain on your pants looks
exactly like Bryan Cranston.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.175
- That's who it is.
- Ooh, that's right.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.176
- Yeah, been staring at it
for an hour.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.178
- That's it.
- Oh.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.548
- Hey.
- Jake, what happened?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.216
- Well, we arrested 12 guys,

19:45.218 --> 19:46.918
Confiscated 35
automatic weapons,

19:46.920 --> 19:48.419
And I found captain Latvia.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.405
- You did?
Oh, my god!

19:50.406 --> 19:52.390
- Uh, melted.
I found him extremely melted.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.724
And grotesque.
Probably should've

19:53.726 --> 19:56.494
Strung that together faster.
- Well, that's okay.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.429
You taught me that Christmas
isn't about presents.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.598
- No, forget all that crap.
Presents rule.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.601
Here, give him this.
From you.

20:03.603 --> 20:06.571
- It's a police man,
just like you, papa.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.339
This is the
coolest present ever.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.474
"I'm detective papa,
and I'm going to go

20:10.476 --> 20:13.444
To the farmers market.
I hope they have aged Gouda."

20:13.446 --> 20:16.280
- Oh, my god, I'm melting.

20:16.282 --> 20:17.982
I'm literally
turning into a puddle.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.217
Genevieve, hold me.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.219
- I got you, babe.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.855
Oh, honey, that flat ass is
perched right on top of my Ute.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.257
- I'm gonna pretend
none of that was said

20:26.259 --> 20:27.358
For the sake of the child.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.529
Wait a minute, is that... Scully?

20:31.531 --> 20:33.564
- * five golden rings *

20:33.566 --> 20:38.302
* four calling birds, three
french hens, two turtle doves *

20:38.304 --> 20:42.640
* and a partridge
in a pear tree *

20:42.642 --> 20:44.609
Hey, guys, thought I'd spread
the Christmas cheer.

20:44.611 --> 20:47.011
- Cool, so you're just
out here caroling solo?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.379
- Yeah,
I guess you could say that.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.615
- No, you can't.
He's not solo.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.717
- You guys came.
- Damn right we did.

20:52.719 --> 20:55.486
- A one, a two,
a one, two, three...

20:55.488 --> 21:00.992
* dashing through the snow
in a one-horse open sleigh *

21:00.994 --> 21:03.561
- They're really
bad singers, papa.

21:03.563 --> 21:06.564
- Yes, they are.
They're horrible.

21:06.566 --> 21:10.434
* bells on bobtail ring,
making spirits *

21:12.438 --> 21:13.738
<i>- Not a doctor.
- Shh.</i>
