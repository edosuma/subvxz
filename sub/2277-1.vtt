WEBVTT

01:29.748 --> 01:31.836
Knockdown! Knockdown!

01:31.875 --> 01:36.594
Another victory for Sweetwater!

01:38.633 --> 01:42.850
And now, for your
entertainment pleasure...

01:42.887 --> 01:44.850
while we get ready
for the main event...

01:44.890 --> 01:49.274
give it up for the Gat Boyz!

02:18.257 --> 02:21.138
I saw Louis the night
that he beat Braddock...

02:21.178 --> 02:23.974
won the title. 1937.

02:24.013 --> 02:25.934
Louis hits him
with a left and a right!

02:25.973 --> 02:27.310
And Braddock is down!

02:27.351 --> 02:29.605
Straight right hand to the jaw.

02:29.645 --> 02:31.982
Christ, they could've
counted to fifty.

02:32.022 --> 02:34.486
He was the best heavyweight...

02:34.524 --> 02:36.612
that ever fought
under the modern rules.

02:36.652 --> 02:38.822
No discussion, the best.

02:38.862 --> 02:43.246
Then the fucking government
chased him about taxes.

02:43.283 --> 02:48.168
Fucking IRS,
fucking bureaucrat assholes.

02:50.582 --> 02:52.001
Fuck it.

03:48.685 --> 03:52.233
...in the west corner,
weighing in at 230 pounds...

03:52.271 --> 03:54.484
wearing the green trunks
with the gold trim...

03:54.524 --> 03:58.406
he's undefeated with
eight wins and no losses.

03:58.444 --> 04:00.908
Representing
the State Prison at Loda...

04:00.947 --> 04:04.078
the great white hope,
Vern Van Zant!

04:07.954 --> 04:09.373
Now in the east corner...

04:09.414 --> 04:11.793
he's also undefeated
and defending champion...

04:11.833 --> 04:15.048
with a record of
67 wins and no losses...

04:15.086 --> 04:18.009
weighing in at 191 pounds...

04:18.048 --> 04:20.093
wearing the burgundy trunks
with the black trim...

04:20.132 --> 04:25.435
Sweetwater's own,
Monroe Hutchen!

04:45.034 --> 04:47.998
All right now, shit birds,
y'all both know the rules.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.960
I want a nice, clean fight,
nothing below the belt.

04:50.998 --> 04:53.754
You understand me? Let's box.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.636
Now remember,
brother convicts...

05:01.676 --> 05:03.012
if you learned how to act...

05:03.053 --> 05:04.555
they wouldn't have to fight
inside of a cage.

05:04.595 --> 05:05.974
And be on your
best behavior, too...

05:06.015 --> 05:07.768
'cause we don't want
no incidents, all right?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.144
Now, let's see what
the pride of Loda...

05:09.185 --> 05:10.980
has to offer against
the great Monroe.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.065
Give Hitler's cousin
his lunch, baby.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.485
It's all you, baby!
It's all you!

05:15.524 --> 05:17.110
Yeah! Come on now!

05:17.150 --> 05:19.029
Come back from
the rail... get back,

05:22.865 --> 05:25.203
And there go the bell.
Here we go.

05:25.243 --> 05:27.915
Monroe comes out
and peppers him...

05:27.954 --> 05:29.582
with a nice left hand,

05:29.622 --> 05:31.126
And another left hand,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.087
Monroe's
just feeling him out...

05:35.128 --> 05:37.006
popping him with
a little left hand,

05:37.045 --> 05:39.008
He going to shine that
bald head up, for sure,

05:39.048 --> 05:42.096
Move your feet!
Oh, yeah, that's right!

05:42.135 --> 05:43.930
Yeah! Yeah!

05:43.971 --> 05:45.725
Beat the teeth out of
his mouth, Monroe!

05:45.764 --> 05:46.975
Come on, man!

05:51.854 --> 05:54.860
A left and a right by Monroe!

05:54.898 --> 05:57.403
This guy hasn't
tagged Monroe yet,

05:57.443 --> 05:59.948
How in the hell
could you be 6-6, 280...

05:59.988 --> 06:01.992
and look wobbly already? Ooh!

06:02.031 --> 06:04.535
He's down! He's down!

06:04.575 --> 06:07.664
He's already down!
Vern Van Zant is down!

06:09.079 --> 06:10.750
We're not even halfway
through the first round...

06:10.790 --> 06:12.293
and he's already down!

06:12.333 --> 06:15.965
Excuse me, sir,
we just got some big news.

06:16.004 --> 06:20.054
The word is, the Iceman's
day of arrival is tomorrow.

06:20.090 --> 06:21.761
E.T.A., 2 p.m.

06:21.801 --> 06:23.805
Now, Vern Van Zant
said he got those...

06:23.845 --> 06:25.765
brand-new tattoos
just for this occasion.

06:25.804 --> 06:26.974
Well, Vern, don't look like...

06:27.016 --> 06:28.936
the parryâ€™s gonna last
too long for you.

06:28.937 --> 06:33.192
This guy is a bum...
big, uncoordinated motherfucker.

06:33.229 --> 06:34.565
Nine...

06:36.023 --> 06:39.029
Look at me! You OK? Box!

06:40.613 --> 06:43.201
Ah, here we go again!
Monroe's on the hunt.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.910
Vern, swinging and a-missing,

06:44.951 --> 06:47.580
Ooh! And another left,
right to the midsection,

06:47.619 --> 06:49.248
Left and right
uppercuts to the head!

06:49.287 --> 06:51.208
Right to the head!
Right to the stomach,

06:51.249 --> 06:53.002
This guy's just
a-swinging and a-missing!

06:53.042 --> 06:54.544
Hits him with
a left and a right!

06:54.584 --> 06:56.505
Monroe's just
tearing his ass up,

06:56.545 --> 06:59.802
Right in the face!
Right to the head!

06:59.839 --> 07:01.885
Left to the midsection!
Right to the head!

07:01.926 --> 07:03.388
Another left and a right!

07:03.469 --> 07:04.972
Oh, my God,
he shined his head up!

07:05.012 --> 07:06.975
I told you, he's shinin' it up!

07:09.977 --> 07:11.977
One more time for Monroe,

07:11.978 --> 07:13.898
Knockout! Knockout!

07:15.606 --> 07:17.568
One round, motherfucker!

07:19.110 --> 07:21.907
That's it! That's it!

07:21.947 --> 07:27.791
It's done! This fight is over!
Monroe wins again!

07:29.621 --> 07:30.873
Spit it.

07:30.914 --> 07:32.918
Yeah, but I got a little
announcement for you.

07:32.958 --> 07:34.378
Got a little
announcement for you.

07:34.419 --> 07:35.796
Little news bulletin.

07:35.836 --> 07:37.923
Y'all been wondering
when that day is coming.

07:37.963 --> 07:41.386
Well, that day is tomorrow.
He's coming to Sweetwater.

07:41.425 --> 07:42.928
The so-called undisputed...

07:42.968 --> 07:44.930
heavyweight champion
of the world...

07:44.971 --> 07:48.603
George "Iceman" Chambers!

07:50.685 --> 07:52.564
What do you say to that,
Monroe? You ready?

08:02.906 --> 08:06.203
OK, here we go. Tape rolling.

08:07.827 --> 08:09.956
Former world
heavyweight champion...

08:09.996 --> 08:11.750
George "Iceman" Chambers...

08:11.790 --> 08:13.460
now you'll be moving
to a new home...

08:13.499 --> 08:15.670
going to live with
murderers and thieves...

08:15.710 --> 08:17.380
in California's newly-built...

08:17.421 --> 08:19.342
Sweetwater Prison
in the Mojave Desert.

08:19.381 --> 08:21.969
How's all this going for you?

08:22.008 --> 08:25.599
I'll be OK.
I got a bad break.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.558
I just gotta
play this thing out.

08:27.598 --> 08:30.771
Your lawyers have filed
all the expected appeals...

08:30.809 --> 08:33.774
but realistically, what do
you think of your chances,,,

08:33.813 --> 08:35.357
of getting out
before serving...

08:35.397 --> 08:37.903
the full sentence
of 6 to 8 years?

08:37.943 --> 08:41.698
I'm not supposed to talk
about that legal stuff.

08:41.736 --> 08:44.116
My people don't want me
commenting on that.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.119
Boxing experts tend to agree...

08:46.159 --> 08:48.664
that even as little
as two years in a prison...

08:48.744 --> 08:51.124
without proper training
could mean the end...

08:51.164 --> 08:53.377
for a boxer your age.
Now, you're regarded...

08:53.416 --> 08:55.002
as one of the greatest
offensive fighters...

08:55.043 --> 08:56.588
in the history of the sport...

08:56.628 --> 08:59.049
an attacker
like Dempsey, Joe Louis...

08:59.089 --> 09:02.053
Rocky Marciano, Joe Frazier,

09:02.092 --> 09:04.889
Just exactly how
damaging to your skills...

09:04.928 --> 09:06.890
is this prison stint
likely to be?

09:06.930 --> 09:10.645
No damage.
I'll stay in shape, work out...

09:10.684 --> 09:12.562
watch what I eat. I'll be fine.

09:12.602 --> 09:15.566
But when an athlete
is removed from competition...

09:15.606 --> 09:18.487
That's where you're making
one big mistake right off.

09:18.526 --> 09:22.951
I'm not an athlete.
I'm a gladiator.

09:22.988 --> 09:24.574
How do you define that?

09:24.615 --> 09:29.207
People play baseball.
Nobody plays boxing.

09:29.245 --> 09:32.084
Iceman, last week after
you were convicted...

09:32.123 --> 09:35.212
boxing's various
so-called governing bodies...

09:35.252 --> 09:37.172
began stripping you of
your title belts...

09:37.211 --> 09:38.589
stripping you...

09:38.629 --> 09:40.383
Who they think they kidding?

09:40.424 --> 09:42.303
Everybody knows I'm the champ.

09:42.342 --> 09:44.513
And I'm gonna be the champ
till I quit.

10:04.698 --> 10:07.621
This fight with
Manfredy is meant to be...

10:07.659 --> 10:09.622
just a tune-up for
George "The Iceman" Chambers...

10:09.661 --> 10:11.248
hopefully leading
to the unification bout...

10:11.288 --> 10:12.624
with Montel Briscoe...

10:12.665 --> 10:15.338
undefeated holder
of the WBC crown,

10:15.376 --> 10:17.964
The two biggest names in boxing
on a collision course...

10:18.004 --> 10:19.633
sometime next year...

10:19.672 --> 10:22.803
assuming the Iceman gets by
the South American challenger,

10:27.305 --> 10:30.561
It's round 1 and one to go,
and it's all Iceman!

10:30.600 --> 10:33.773
He's stalking Manfredy,
chasing the big South American,

10:38.483 --> 10:40.153
Iceman with a right,
another right,

10:40.194 --> 10:42.865
Another right
and a left to the body!

10:42.905 --> 10:46.579
Oh, and a right-hand uppercut,
That staggered Manfredy!

10:46.617 --> 10:49.748
Iceman stalking him,
He knows he's got him hurt,

10:49.787 --> 10:52.751
Oh, body shots!
Right, left to the body!

10:52.790 --> 10:55.378
Left hook and he's down!
He's down! He's down!

10:55.417 --> 10:58.090
That's why they call him
the Iceman!

10:59.712 --> 11:01.174
Well, Carlos Manfredy...

11:01.216 --> 11:03.972
gets a one-way ticket
back to Brazil!

11:05.844 --> 11:07.390
George "Iceman" Chambers...

11:07.429 --> 11:10.017
remains undefeated
heavyweight champion!

11:10.057 --> 11:12.521
And the big man on the block!

11:18.315 --> 11:20.821
Are you fighting Montel next?

11:20.902 --> 11:23.115
Just another sucker who's
gonna get his ass whipped.

11:23.154 --> 11:25.659
If the money's right,
bring on Montel.

11:25.741 --> 11:27.619
Nobody's running,
nobody's ducking.

11:27.659 --> 11:31.625
Nobody... I mean, nobody...
can stand up to what I got.

11:31.663 --> 11:33.041
Does that include Montel?

11:33.082 --> 11:35.086
Oh, yeah, that damn sure
includes Montel.

11:37.169 --> 11:38.422
Mr. Lewis!

11:38.462 --> 11:40.967
Estimates are up
to 300 million dollars...

11:41.006 --> 11:42.634
for the pay-per-view
gate alone.

11:42.675 --> 11:43.969
Any comment on that?

11:44.010 --> 11:45.638
Let's make the deal first.

11:45.678 --> 11:49.978
But my first guess is
you're a few million short.

11:50.016 --> 11:52.270
And, Iceman,
it's nine months till summer.

11:52.310 --> 11:53.645
What's next for you?

11:53.686 --> 11:55.522
Well, first of all,
I'm gonna go to L.A...

11:55.563 --> 11:57.025
you know, see some friends...

11:57.106 --> 11:58.985
then I'm gonna do
a little partying.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.490
Hey, hey...that's it.

12:04.530 --> 12:05.907
I've done things in my life...

12:05.949 --> 12:07.949
maybe I shouldn't have.
I know that.

12:07.950 --> 12:11.081
But I did not want to,
and I told him "No."

12:17.794 --> 12:20.629
You'll be moving
into a new home...

12:20.630 --> 12:22.927
going to live with
murderers and thieves...

12:23.008 --> 12:24.344
in California's newly-built...

12:24.345 --> 12:26.802
Sweetwater Prison
in the Mojave Desert,

12:26.803 --> 12:28.515
Without getting into
legal strategy...

12:28.516 --> 12:29.933
let's discuss your trial.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.644
You continue to maintain
your innocence.

12:31.725 --> 12:33.604
I didn't rape nobody.

12:33.644 --> 12:35.646
I done a lot of wrong shit
in my life...

12:35.647 --> 12:37.648
but I ain't no punk-ass rapist.

12:37.649 --> 12:40.028
Look at me.
What I gotta rape somebody for?

13:13.894 --> 13:15.438
Psst. Monroe.

13:15.479 --> 13:17.024
You see him through the window?

13:17.064 --> 13:19.110
Big deal's got his own
helicopter service...

13:19.149 --> 13:21.028
instead of coming
in here on the bus.

13:21.069 --> 13:23.156
He's the champ.

13:23.195 --> 13:26.368
What's this shit?
Don't think negative, man.

13:26.408 --> 13:27.868
I don't want to hear that shit.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.954
This is your house.
You own this place.

13:31.830 --> 13:34.209
If this was my house,
I could get up and leave.

13:44.050 --> 13:45.386
He's here.

13:45.427 --> 13:47.139
Just getting out
of the helicopter.

13:47.178 --> 13:49.976
Maybe you'd like to meet him,
Mr. Ripstein.

13:50.016 --> 13:52.145
I could bring him over.
You two could talk boxing.

13:52.183 --> 13:55.315
I'll tell you when
I want to talk to him.

14:03.487 --> 14:06.367
Why couldn't your high-priced
team of lawyers...

14:06.406 --> 14:08.368
convince a judge and a jury?

14:08.450 --> 14:10.955
Because I put people
in body bags on TV...

14:10.995 --> 14:12.915
and get paid
a lot of money for it.

14:12.955 --> 14:15.418
Because I'm a big, bad,
black motherfucker...

14:15.458 --> 14:17.253
that's why nobody believes me.

14:17.293 --> 14:20.049
I have received
over 170 requests...

14:20.088 --> 14:22.426
for interviews with you,
Mr. Chambers.

14:22.465 --> 14:24.092
Networks, local TV, cable...

14:24.133 --> 14:26.178
ever newspaper organization
in the country...

14:26.219 --> 14:29.434
foreign press, foreign TV...
you name it,

14:29.473 --> 14:31.644
I have turned them all down,

14:31.683 --> 14:35.190
Mr. Chambers,
here is Sweetwater,

14:35.227 --> 14:37.065
Maximum security, level five...

14:37.104 --> 14:38.858
state correctional
institution...

14:38.899 --> 14:41.362
with nearly
seven hundred prisoners.

14:41.401 --> 14:45.534
We house only murderers,
armed robbers, rapists...

14:45.572 --> 14:47.284
and those with
connections to gangs...

14:47.325 --> 14:49.454
and other forms
of organized crime.

14:49.493 --> 14:53.459
The state is trying to
spare lesser criminals...

14:53.497 --> 14:56.503
the contaminating influence
of these more hardened types.

14:56.541 --> 15:00.006
Now, we don't want
any incidents that might add...

15:00.045 --> 15:02.383
to your already great
difficulties, Mr. Chambers,

15:02.422 --> 15:04.426
This is Mr. Mercker.

15:04.508 --> 15:06.972
He's the senior prison officer,
He's the head guard,

15:07.011 --> 15:09.266
This is Ms. Early,
our administrative officer.

15:09.305 --> 15:10.976
She can arrange
for religious counsel...

15:11.015 --> 15:12.268
or instruction, if you wish.

15:12.308 --> 15:17.151
Whatever.
I need a CD player and some CDs.

15:17.189 --> 15:18.692
Now, I'll give you a list.

15:18.731 --> 15:20.819
My people on the outside
will pay for it all.

15:20.858 --> 15:22.654
Not possible
for the first six months.

15:22.695 --> 15:24.114
It's a privilege,
has to be earned.

15:24.153 --> 15:25.615
Any and all privileges...

15:25.697 --> 15:28.201
will depend upon
your general conduct,

15:28.241 --> 15:31.038
Mr. Chambers,
you have been convicted...

15:31.077 --> 15:32.998
and sent here
for the crime of rape.

15:33.038 --> 15:34.666
That's a very serious mater,

15:34.707 --> 15:36.251
If you'd take advantage...

15:36.291 --> 15:38.044
of this opportunity
to apologize...

15:38.085 --> 15:40.256
to this woman
and to sports fans...

15:40.296 --> 15:42.216
and the American public
for letting them down...

15:42.256 --> 15:43.925
heck, even the former
president of the...

15:43.966 --> 15:45.678
Man, fuck the president!

15:45.718 --> 15:47.012
I ain't apologizing...

15:47.051 --> 15:49.765
not to you, not to her,
not to nobody!

15:49.805 --> 15:52.101
And you lucky I got this
damn gate between you and me...

15:52.141 --> 15:55.147
or Iâ€™d rip you a new asshole,
you judgmental motherfucker!

15:56.730 --> 15:59.067
Another strong
athlete in the joint!

15:59.107 --> 16:01.654
Welcome to Sweetwater,
Chambers!

16:03.987 --> 16:05.656
If you need anything, champ...

16:05.697 --> 16:06.992
I got you covered,

16:14.748 --> 16:18.964
Hey, champ!
Seen all your fights, man!

16:28.011 --> 16:29.388
You got a name?

16:30.680 --> 16:33.394
Mingo.

16:33.433 --> 16:38.151
Mingo, move your shit,
stay out of my way...

16:38.189 --> 16:41.027
and we'll get along just fine.

16:46.530 --> 16:49.870
Hey, listen. It's an honor
to be cellmates with you.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.996
I don't want no trouble, champ.

16:52.036 --> 16:55.209
No trouble. You just gonna
stay out of my way.

16:55.247 --> 16:56.793
He just thinks he's the king.

16:56.833 --> 16:59.672
Because he's the heavyweight
champ, he's the man.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.924
Well, for some of us others,
we have rights, too...

17:01.964 --> 17:05.720
and I had the right to say no
if I didn't want to.

17:05.758 --> 17:09.223
I want everybody
to keep your distance.

17:09.304 --> 17:11.642
I don't need to make
no new friends...

17:11.682 --> 17:14.103
or hear no sad stories
on why they're here.

17:14.142 --> 17:16.439
I got my own sad story for that.

17:16.478 --> 17:18.773
I ain't loanin' nobody
no money...

17:18.814 --> 17:20.567
so you tell 'em don't even ask.

17:20.608 --> 17:22.945
And I don't want
nobody talking to me...

17:22.986 --> 17:25.531
unless I talk to 'em first.

17:25.569 --> 17:28.242
-You got that?
-Got it.

17:28.282 --> 17:30.495
"Leave the champ alone."

17:38.293 --> 17:40.755
I know boxing.

17:40.795 --> 17:43.509
I seen a lot of fights.

17:43.548 --> 17:46.887
You're a good champeen,

17:46.926 --> 17:48.429
Who the hell are you?

17:48.512 --> 17:50.307
This is Mendy Ripstein.

17:50.346 --> 17:51.975
He's a very important man
in here.

17:52.016 --> 17:53.560
Ripstein,

17:53.600 --> 17:57.984
Yeah, my manager, Yank Lewis,
he told me to say hello.

17:58.022 --> 17:59.399
I don't remember him.

17:59.439 --> 18:01.901
He said you two
were friends in Miami...

18:01.941 --> 18:03.945
about twenty-five years ago.

18:03.986 --> 18:07.201
I didn't have
any friends in Miami.

18:07.239 --> 18:10.954
A lot of people, they say
they knew me from the old days.

18:10.993 --> 18:12.663
They're full of shit.

18:12.703 --> 18:15.959
You're a good champeen...

18:15.998 --> 18:19.463
but we got a champeen
right here...

18:19.543 --> 18:22.299
and he can kick your ass.

18:25.592 --> 18:26.886
Kiddin' me.

18:26.927 --> 18:30.558
I watch all your fights.
You're not as good as you were.

18:30.597 --> 18:33.060
You're just looking
for one big punch.

18:33.099 --> 18:35.855
You're not
throwing combinations.

18:35.894 --> 18:39.693
You're not using as much
head movement on defense.

18:39.731 --> 18:40.942
Yeah, right, old man.

18:40.982 --> 18:43.278
I'm just knocking
motherfuckers out.

18:43.318 --> 18:45.782
Who's the punk in here
you got in mind?

18:45.821 --> 18:49.996
Oh, did I hurt your feelings?

18:50.033 --> 18:52.746
Fuck you.

18:58.042 --> 19:01.882
Heh. Monroe.
Name's Monroe Hutchen.

19:01.921 --> 19:04.635
Mr. Ripstein thinks
he can whip up on you, man...

19:04.674 --> 19:08.974
but no offense. Not trying
to cause any trouble here.

20:07.322 --> 20:10.077
Which one of these suckers
in here is Monroe Hutchen?

20:10.117 --> 20:14.709
He's over there in line,
wearing a white cap.

20:14.746 --> 20:16.541
What's happening, Mo? Yeah.

20:16.581 --> 20:19.003
Brought in
some big guys in here.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.922
He beat 'em all.

20:21.961 --> 20:24.508
It ain't only about being big.

20:24.548 --> 20:27.011
You gotta have skill, son.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.066
You Monroe Hutchen?

20:43.067 --> 20:44.402
Yep.

20:44.443 --> 20:48.034
I guess you know who I am.

20:48.073 --> 20:51.746
Are you the champion in here?

20:51.784 --> 20:54.163
Yeah.

20:54.203 --> 20:57.292
Not the heavyweight champ.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.546
Champion...

21:01.587 --> 21:04.175
heavyweight or
any other kind they got.

21:04.214 --> 21:09.140
I didn't even know they had
boxing in a place like this.

21:09.178 --> 21:11.808
Well, it's a special program.

21:11.846 --> 21:14.394
We only get bouts
ever six months.

21:14.433 --> 21:17.314
Mostly we fight guys
from other prisons.

21:17.353 --> 21:19.774
How long you been on top?

21:19.814 --> 21:23.530
Ten years.
Ever since I got in here.

21:23.567 --> 21:27.575
Damn. Brother, that's
a real fine record you got.

21:27.613 --> 21:30.285
I gotta congratulate you.

21:30.324 --> 21:32.705
Yeah! You want some of this?

21:32.743 --> 21:34.454
Yeah! Come on!

21:34.495 --> 21:36.332
I'm gonna win.

21:36.372 --> 21:38.501
Come on! What?

21:38.541 --> 21:41.338
Ain't no champ in here but me!

21:43.297 --> 21:46.219
I'm giving you another chance.

21:46.258 --> 21:49.138
I'm inclined to overlook
what happened this afternoon...

21:49.176 --> 21:51.180
and not make it a par of
your official record,

21:53.347 --> 21:57.147
Look, let's get something
straight, Mr. Warden.

21:57.185 --> 22:00.818
I'm not just some convict
doing five to ten.

22:00.857 --> 22:04.363
I'm a real big deal.

22:04.443 --> 22:06.697
Not only am I
heavyweight champ...

22:06.737 --> 22:09.868
I'm close to being the most
famous man in the world.

22:09.906 --> 22:11.493
So if you think
you're gonna lean on me...

22:11.534 --> 22:13.079
like these punks
you got in here...

22:13.119 --> 22:14.330
you better think again...

22:14.370 --> 22:16.458
because if anything
happens to me...

22:16.497 --> 22:20.339
it's gonna be on
the 6:00 news worldwide.

22:20.376 --> 22:22.004
There's gonna be
a whole lot of people...

22:22.045 --> 22:24.090
askin' a whole lot
of questions...

22:24.130 --> 22:26.176
and you and your little crew
here better know that.

22:26.215 --> 22:28.219
Just my luck he got sent here.

22:28.259 --> 22:31.432
Iceman, my ass.
He's just another goddamn thug.

22:31.471 --> 22:33.600
One who happens
to be a world champion...

22:33.640 --> 22:36.562
and a potential
public relations nightmare.

22:44.067 --> 22:47.114
Mr. Hutchen.

22:47.153 --> 22:48.740
You know the little problem...

22:48.781 --> 22:51.035
you had with
the Iceman yesterday?

22:51.075 --> 22:52.828
Got you in some trouble.

22:54.370 --> 22:56.792
Heavyweight champ.

22:56.831 --> 22:59.002
Man gave me a cheap shot.

22:59.041 --> 23:00.543
Yeah, I know,

23:00.584 --> 23:02.296
By the court
and the higher powers...

23:02.337 --> 23:05.176
you contributed to a situation
that threatened violence.

23:05.215 --> 23:07.761
One thing you ought
to know by now, Monroe,

23:07.800 --> 23:10.973
Life ain't fair,
Not fair at all,

23:19.353 --> 23:20.982
The warden understands...

23:21.022 --> 23:22.693
what he's doing
is unfortunate...

23:22.732 --> 23:24.987
but unless Mr. Hutchen
and the Iceman are separated...

23:25.026 --> 23:26.487
there will be
enormous pressure...

23:26.528 --> 23:28.825
for another
physical confrontation,

23:28.864 --> 23:30.325
Nobody likes this...

23:30.365 --> 23:32.327
but Mr. Hutchen's presence
is an incitement to violence...

23:32.368 --> 23:34.998
and he will be kept in there
until such time...

23:35.037 --> 23:38.627
as we can make arrangements for
his travel to another facility.

23:48.634 --> 23:50.930
OK.

23:52.555 --> 23:53.933
Hey, Monroe.

23:53.973 --> 23:55.977
Take care of yourself
in there, Monroe.

24:01.189 --> 24:01.982
Sergeant Marinez
to the hill tower,

24:01.983 --> 24:04.278
Sergeant Marinez
to the hill tower,

24:04.318 --> 24:06.822
Sergeant Marinez
to the hill tower,

24:10.573 --> 24:12.994
New duty roster just got posted.

24:13.034 --> 24:16.248
You're working
in the kitchen with me.

24:16.287 --> 24:18.959
Look, since we're gonna
be stuck together...

24:18.999 --> 24:22.714
what you in here for?

24:22.754 --> 24:24.757
You know, champ,
I don't mean to be...

24:24.796 --> 24:27.719
telling you what to do
or anything, but...

24:27.758 --> 24:32.016
it's not considered polite
to ask why we're here.

24:32.053 --> 24:35.184
Kinda violation of the ethics.
You know, the code?

24:35.224 --> 24:36.393
Yeah.

24:36.434 --> 24:39.857
People take it as disrespect.

24:39.937 --> 24:44.278
Yo! You keeping in shape,
Mr. Iceman?

24:44.317 --> 24:47.406
Who's this chump?

24:47.445 --> 24:51.161
Call him Ratbag.
Runs with Monroe.

24:51.199 --> 24:52.368
Shit.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.454
Thinks he's his manager,

24:54.494 --> 24:57.208
-Ratbag?
-Ratbag.

25:00.083 --> 25:04.509
OK, Ratbag,
what you in here for?

25:06.548 --> 25:09.345
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

25:11.595 --> 25:13.431
Arson.

25:13.471 --> 25:17.604
Nothin' up close and personal.

25:17.642 --> 25:20.064
You hit people much?

25:20.104 --> 25:21.856
What do you mean?

25:21.898 --> 25:24.111
You know, punch people.

25:24.149 --> 25:26.654
When you were a kid
or since you been in here.

25:26.694 --> 25:29.741
Sometimes. Not much.

25:29.780 --> 25:31.617
I never was the physical type.

25:31.657 --> 25:34.579
You want to hit me?

25:34.619 --> 25:38.585
What, are you kidding?

25:38.665 --> 25:40.794
You can say you did it.

25:40.834 --> 25:42.754
"I punched
the heavyweight champ."

25:42.794 --> 25:44.213
You can tell people
all about it.

25:44.253 --> 25:45.422
It might even make you...

25:45.463 --> 25:48.011
feel good about
your little punk-ass self.

25:48.049 --> 25:50.721
I don't want to hit you, Iceman.
Shit!

25:50.760 --> 25:51.929
Sure you do!

25:51.970 --> 25:53.932
You don't even like me.
Come on, man.

25:53.972 --> 25:56.311
Go crazy. Let one go.

25:56.349 --> 25:58.770
If I hit you just this once,
will that end it?

25:58.810 --> 26:00.314
I won't have to hit you anymore?

26:00.354 --> 26:02.567
All you gotta do
is hit me one time...

26:02.607 --> 26:04.986
and I'm telling you, man,
it'll make you feel good...

26:05.026 --> 26:07.656
and it ain't gonna hurt me none.

26:07.695 --> 26:09.489
Aright. Just once.

26:09.529 --> 26:11.909
Just to satisfy whatever
weird trip you're on...

26:11.949 --> 26:13.160
and show you
that I'm a good guy...

26:13.200 --> 26:14.829
trying to do what you want.

26:14.869 --> 26:16.163
Right. Thank you.

26:16.203 --> 26:18.583
You're welcome.

26:21.376 --> 26:22.503
Unh!

26:22.543 --> 26:24.129
Ohh! Yeah, baby!

26:24.171 --> 26:27.969
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
I hit the Iceman!

26:28.007 --> 26:29.176
Yo!

26:30.509 --> 26:34.058
-Yeah!
-Thank you.

26:34.096 --> 26:35.933
You still feel good, Ratbag?

26:35.973 --> 26:38.311
Yeah. I guess so.

26:38.351 --> 26:40.271
You're not mad, are you?

26:40.312 --> 26:42.107
Ohh! Damn!

26:42.147 --> 26:44.026
No, I'm not mad at you.

26:44.066 --> 26:47.030
Now, you go tell Monroe
what I said.

26:47.069 --> 26:49.030
Ain't but one champ in here!

26:49.071 --> 26:51.700
And it ain't some
nickel-and-dime convict...

26:51.740 --> 26:53.702
beating up on fools in prison!

26:53.742 --> 26:55.913
Get that bitch outta here.

27:33.117 --> 27:35.789
I ain't gotta spend my time
makin' potato salad.

27:37.370 --> 27:38.580
Where I come from...

27:38.621 --> 27:41.002
we didn't have
any kind of salads.

27:41.041 --> 27:43.337
Where's that?

27:43.377 --> 27:46.842
Indian country. Oklahoma.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.010
Hmm.

27:49.049 --> 27:50.594
Look, man, I know
I'm not supposed to ask...

27:50.635 --> 27:52.389
but what you in here for?

27:54.888 --> 27:57.351
I stole some rich guy's
Mercedes in L.A.

27:59.560 --> 28:02.734
I got a Mercedes. Three of 'em.

28:05.984 --> 28:07.737
Mr. Hutchen.

28:07.776 --> 28:10.907
It's Darlene Early, the G.A.O.
General administration officer.

28:10.946 --> 28:14.829
I need to do
the interview and paperwork...

28:14.868 --> 28:16.705
for your transfer to Folsom.

28:16.745 --> 28:19.959
How are your spirits?
I want you to know...

28:19.998 --> 28:21.668
I'm not in favor
of solitary confinement.

28:21.708 --> 28:24.505
Not for you,
not for anybody else.

28:24.545 --> 28:26.548
It's OK in here.

28:26.589 --> 28:28.091
You can't be serious.

28:28.174 --> 28:31.347
It's all a prison.

28:31.384 --> 28:33.848
I live inside my head.

28:33.888 --> 28:36.643
So that's how
you're doing your time?

28:36.681 --> 28:39.979
Are you really that much
in control of your emotions?

28:42.020 --> 28:45.109
Been that way all my life.

28:45.148 --> 28:48.989
Only time I ever lost it
is what got me in here.

28:49.028 --> 28:53.119
Yeah. I'm familiar
with your case history.

28:53.157 --> 28:56.330
So you prefer your own company?

28:56.369 --> 28:58.373
Most of the time.

28:58.412 --> 29:00.834
I am supposed to recommend
whether or not...

29:00.874 --> 29:03.964
you seem to require a detailed
psychiatric evaluation.

29:04.002 --> 29:05.838
Other than the incident
in the mess hall...

29:05.879 --> 29:07.508
That wasn't me.

29:07.547 --> 29:10.971
Why don't you
go talk to the hotshot champ?

29:11.009 --> 29:12.638
Ask him about it.

29:12.678 --> 29:14.974
So you deny any responsibility?

29:15.013 --> 29:18.521
Yeah, I deny it. How does
that affect me movin' on?

29:18.559 --> 29:21.899
This has no bearing
in your transfer to Folsom.

29:25.023 --> 29:26.986
You know, this whole thing...

29:27.026 --> 29:30.241
this whole thing
is about people bein' scared.

29:30.279 --> 29:32.491
Aren't you afraid of him?

29:32.532 --> 29:35.621
Afraid. Shit, no.

29:35.659 --> 29:37.246
He's a fighter. I'm a fighter.

29:37.287 --> 29:38.956
If I'm better on that day,
I win.

29:38.996 --> 29:40.499
That's just the way it goes.

29:40.581 --> 29:45.215
Someday, ever fighter loses.

29:45.253 --> 29:46.965
Sooner or later,
somebody comes along...

29:47.005 --> 29:49.677
and they got your ticket.

29:49.716 --> 29:54.266
Too old, just wasn't your day,
whatever the reason is.

29:54.305 --> 29:58.062
In the end,
everybody gets beaten.

29:59.560 --> 30:04.194
The most you can hope for
is that you stay on top a while.

30:04.231 --> 30:05.775
Be the best.

30:10.654 --> 30:13.034
I tried to say hello
to that old gangster.

30:13.073 --> 30:15.662
Ripstein.
He said he don't remember you.

30:15.702 --> 30:18.916
He remembers.
He just don't want to admit it.

30:18.954 --> 30:21.042
Standard mob procedure.

30:21.082 --> 30:23.253
Guys like him deny
they ever had a mother.

30:23.293 --> 30:25.589
Yeah. Right.

30:25.628 --> 30:28.216
How you makin' out, man?

30:28.256 --> 30:30.594
It's shit, but I can handle it.

30:30.634 --> 30:33.013
Yeah. Rumor goin' around
you almost stared a riot.

30:33.052 --> 30:35.056
It was all bullshit, man.

30:35.095 --> 30:37.851
I had to let the peeps in here
know who's the boss.

30:37.891 --> 30:40.062
Just keep
your goddamn nose clean.

30:40.101 --> 30:42.022
You already got
enough problems.

30:43.188 --> 30:45.317
And since they stripped
you of your title...

30:45.357 --> 30:47.361
they're having this
elimination tournament...

30:47.400 --> 30:48.820
to figure out a new champ.

30:48.860 --> 30:52.780
Everybody thinks
Briscoe's a lock to win it.

30:52.781 --> 30:55.745
Word is, Montel's fighting
Jimmy Stubbs in July.

30:55.785 --> 30:57.622
Jimmy Stubbs's a bum.

30:57.661 --> 31:00.458
The good news is
you get outta here...

31:00.498 --> 31:02.961
fight the new champ,
we're looking at...

31:03.000 --> 31:04.796
the biggest payday
of boxing history.

31:04.834 --> 31:07.005
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

31:07.045 --> 31:10.093
The one thing I can tell you,
you lost a lot of fan base...

31:10.174 --> 31:12.303
with this conviction thing.

31:12.343 --> 31:14.222
Fuck the fans.

31:14.261 --> 31:16.934
I get outta here,
I'll get 'em back.

31:16.974 --> 31:22.025
The fans pay your bills,
and don't you ever forget it.

31:22.062 --> 31:24.813
Yeah.

31:24.814 --> 31:26.818
You gotta keep the pressure
on these lawyers, OK...

31:26.857 --> 31:28.194
and get you outta here
to fight this...

31:28.235 --> 31:29.988
big money fight with Briscoe.

31:30.027 --> 31:31.196
Yeah.

31:31.239 --> 31:33.785
You can't be servin'
no full sentence.

31:33.824 --> 31:36.036
You're 35 years old.
Time is tickin'.

31:36.076 --> 31:38.372
Everything
you ever worked for...

31:38.412 --> 31:40.082
it's going
right out the window.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.837
Janiro's an agile boxer...

31:44.876 --> 31:46.421
who has the ability
of a champion,

31:46.461 --> 31:48.048
Janiro is fresh off a victor...

31:48.088 --> 31:50.050
over Charlie Consario,

31:50.090 --> 31:51.634
The Rock turns it on,

31:51.675 --> 31:53.137
It's Le Graziano alone,

31:53.177 --> 31:55.055
He won't give Janiro
punching room,

31:55.095 --> 31:56.348
Stays after his man,

31:56.389 --> 31:59.060
Hits him from all angles,

31:59.099 --> 32:00.602
He remembers things
from a long time ago...

32:00.643 --> 32:02.104
clear as a bell...

32:02.145 --> 32:04.608
but ever day,
I gotta tell him who I am.

32:04.647 --> 32:09.031
He's in another world:
Cuba, forty years ago...

32:09.068 --> 32:11.531
or some fight he saw in 1953.

32:11.571 --> 32:13.116
Then all of a sudden...

32:13.156 --> 32:16.329
he's right there with you,
like everything's normal.

32:16.368 --> 32:18.831
And mean...
he can be mean as shit.

32:18.870 --> 32:21.167
Look, we went to the Emme.

32:21.206 --> 32:23.043
We paid good money
for his protection...

32:23.082 --> 32:24.502
and his personal needs.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.380
They gave you the job.

32:26.420 --> 32:28.214
I got him an oversized cell...

32:28.254 --> 32:31.344
ground level, so he don't
have to use the stairs.

32:31.382 --> 32:35.057
Food privileges.
Relaxed dress code.

32:35.095 --> 32:36.556
Big easy chair.

32:36.597 --> 32:38.726
I even got him his own
little boxing library.

32:38.766 --> 32:41.980
And he's safe. I promise.

32:42.019 --> 32:44.732
These guys I got, they don't
let any harm come his way.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.051
Hey, chief.

33:12.175 --> 33:13.386
Mmm.

33:14.552 --> 33:17.308
How you getting along
with your new cellmate?

33:17.348 --> 33:20.646
-He's OK.
-Mmm.

33:20.685 --> 33:24.024
Rumor has it he took down
one of the skinheads.

33:25.648 --> 33:29.906
A lot of rumors in prison,
you know?

33:29.944 --> 33:32.825
Ah, probably deserved it anyway.

33:32.863 --> 33:34.449
Maybe.

33:43.708 --> 33:46.213
We hear you don't want to
associate with anybody here.

33:46.252 --> 33:49.633
Maybe you got
way too much attitude, man.

33:59.182 --> 34:00.978
Unh.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.982
Aaron's an expert.
He's the man on appeals.

34:05.022 --> 34:07.067
But before we talk
about your appeal...

34:07.108 --> 34:09.989
I need to tell you about
Miss Tawnee Rawlins.

34:10.027 --> 34:13.408
She's filed a civil lawsuit
in the amount of $75 million.

34:13.447 --> 34:16.578
You handlin' that?

34:16.618 --> 34:19.331
I'd recommend
an outside attorney.

34:19.370 --> 34:20.539
Another specialist.

34:20.580 --> 34:23.460
However, we can handle
your tax litigation.

34:23.498 --> 34:25.837
The government has filed
an intent to audit.

34:25.877 --> 34:27.839
We have someone in the firm
that can deal with that.

34:27.879 --> 34:29.005
Is any of this covered...

34:29.047 --> 34:31.384
by the $2 million
I already paid you?

34:31.424 --> 34:33.594
We get the same deal as you get.

34:33.635 --> 34:37.059
You get paid win or lose.
So do we.

34:37.096 --> 34:39.434
There are a couple
of procedural areas...

34:39.475 --> 34:42.606
that are still in question...
possible reversible error.

34:42.643 --> 34:46.025
But I'm not gonna kid you.
I'd make us a long shot.

34:46.063 --> 34:48.150
You're looking at
a six- to eight-year sentence...

34:48.190 --> 34:50.696
with possible time off
for good behavior.

34:50.735 --> 34:52.531
Now, in California,
that means...

34:52.571 --> 34:55.744
you're eligible for parole
in four years.

34:55.783 --> 34:56.952
What you need to focus on...

34:56.992 --> 34:58.829
is if you become
a model prisoner...

34:58.869 --> 35:00.957
exhibit
special circumstances...

35:00.997 --> 35:02.960
you could be considered
for a work furlough...

35:02.999 --> 35:04.877
as soon as eighteen months
to two years.

35:07.044 --> 35:09.256
So it don't matter
whether I did it or not?

35:09.296 --> 35:10.465
It doesn't work that way.

35:10.506 --> 35:12.217
Justice and the law
are separate issues.

35:12.218 --> 35:14.930
Let's get back to
some of your other problems.

35:14.969 --> 35:16.179
We've done an audit.

35:16.220 --> 35:18.642
Your financial situation
is a mess.

35:18.682 --> 35:20.518
-No, that's bullshit.
-No bullshit.

35:20.558 --> 35:24.399
Big financial settlements
with your ex-wives, entourage.

35:24.437 --> 35:26.191
Bad investments
and misrepresentations...

35:26.231 --> 35:27.692
by your ex-business manager.

35:27.732 --> 35:29.111
I'm gonna sue that motherfucker.

35:29.150 --> 35:33.033
And what about this IRS shit?
Where do I stand on that?

35:33.072 --> 35:36.537
By the firm's calculations,
you could end up owing them...

35:36.574 --> 35:39.914
$7 million in back taxes,
and that's just the feds.

35:39.953 --> 35:42.625
Then there's the state.
The bottom line...

35:42.665 --> 35:44.919
we need to get
your black ass outta here...

35:44.958 --> 35:46.335
and back in the ring.

36:05.314 --> 36:07.025
Clive Johnson here ringside...

36:07.064 --> 36:09.110
for KHIL Channel 13
in the Bay Area,

36:09.150 --> 36:11.780
Next, round seven
of the California...

36:11.861 --> 36:13.573
state heavyweight
championship fight...

36:13.613 --> 36:18.414
here from the Palmer Arena
in downtown Oakland,

36:18.452 --> 36:20.039
Challenger Monroe Hutchen's
undefeated...

36:20.078 --> 36:21.874
takin' on
state champ Butch Davis...

36:21.913 --> 36:24.043
in what, so far,
has been a nearly even fight,

36:24.082 --> 36:25.791
There's the bell!

36:25.792 --> 36:27.755
Davis has a bad cut
above his left eye...

36:27.793 --> 36:29.005
and Monroe Hutchen
looks like...

36:29.047 --> 36:31.092
he wants to do
something about it,

36:32.674 --> 36:35.095
It's all Monroe,
it's all Monroe!

36:36.346 --> 36:38.642
A big right hand,
Another right!

36:38.680 --> 36:42.020
Davis is down,
and this fight is over!

36:42.059 --> 36:45.065
After forty-three seconds
in the seventh round...

36:45.104 --> 36:46.858
Monroe Hutchen is the new...

36:46.898 --> 36:49.027
California state
heavyweight champion!

36:55.114 --> 36:56.950
Your attorneys have
come to me and asked me...

36:56.990 --> 36:59.245
to handle your response
to the plaintiff's filing,

36:59.286 --> 37:02.709
As you know, you are now facing
a separate civil suit...

37:02.747 --> 37:04.166
that may well go to trial...

37:04.207 --> 37:06.963
over the criminal charges
you've been convicted of.

37:07.002 --> 37:10.379
Briefly, "That on March 17,
you and four other men...

37:10.380 --> 37:12.008
"took six women
via private jet...

37:12.049 --> 37:13.593
"from Las Vegas
to Los Angeles..."

37:13.634 --> 37:14.803
Showgirls.

37:14.843 --> 37:17.431
"At approximately 1:30 p. m....

37:17.471 --> 37:19.016
"you checked into
the penthouse suite...

37:19.098 --> 37:20.517
"of the Beverly Manor hotel."

37:20.557 --> 37:23.313
Until that point of the evening,
all parties concede...

37:23.352 --> 37:25.314
but for minor discrepancies,
the foregoing is true.

37:25.354 --> 37:27.065
What happened next
is in question.

37:27.106 --> 37:30.320
No question.
I ain't no punk-ass rapist.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.196
She wanted it.

37:32.235 --> 37:34.949
Look. None of this makes
any difference at this point.

37:34.989 --> 37:36.534
We're just trying
to get an over...

37:36.574 --> 37:38.745
No. She didn't say no.
She ain't say shit.

37:38.785 --> 37:39.912
She didn't have a problem
with any of it.

37:39.952 --> 37:42.540
Miss Rawlins
effectively convinced...

37:42.579 --> 37:44.166
the criminal trial jury
that she believed that...

37:44.207 --> 37:46.378
you could break her
in two with one arm.

37:46.418 --> 37:47.879
Yeah, uh-huh.

37:47.919 --> 37:51.134
That's why she was makin'
all them happy sounds...

37:51.172 --> 37:54.137
'cause I was killin' her, right?

37:54.175 --> 37:56.179
Some women like it rough.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.850
You know anything about that?

37:59.889 --> 38:02.478
That wasn't par
of your testimony.

38:02.518 --> 38:06.526
A lawyer said don't sound
like I'm calling her a ho.

38:06.564 --> 38:08.943
The prosecution
pegged you as a bully.

38:08.983 --> 38:12.406
And she could explain it away
easily enough by saying...

38:12.444 --> 38:15.909
that you mistook what were
in fact her cries for help...

38:15.948 --> 38:17.284
for she was just in pain.

38:17.325 --> 38:21.040
I heard pain before,
and... ha ha ha...

38:21.078 --> 38:23.958
believe me,
she wasn't in no pain.

38:23.998 --> 38:26.378
She's asking $75 million...

38:26.417 --> 38:30.132
but I don't like negotiating
with your appeal pending.

38:30.171 --> 38:33.720
No negotiatin'.
I ain't givin' that bitch shit.

38:36.552 --> 38:41.187
And then when he finished,
he just put back on his pants...

38:41.224 --> 38:44.522
and went back out
into the party...

38:44.560 --> 38:46.105
and left me alone.

39:09.336 --> 39:10.881
Champ...

39:10.922 --> 39:13.927
I'm looking to be
your friend, Champ,

39:13.967 --> 39:16.304
I'm a gift.

39:16.344 --> 39:18.807
Well, I don't need no gifts.

39:18.846 --> 39:20.847
Who sent you?

39:20.848 --> 39:24.439
Saladin.
He want to be your friend.

39:24.478 --> 39:27.693
He kind of run things
for El Faziz Assassins.

39:27.730 --> 39:29.901
You can check it out.

39:29.942 --> 39:32.113
You kind of pretty for a bitch.

39:32.152 --> 39:34.448
But I don't want to owe nobody.

39:34.487 --> 39:38.699
You tell him I said that.
Now get outta here.

39:38.700 --> 39:41.372
You may be the champ,
but you are only one guy.

39:41.411 --> 39:43.206
Let me help you out.

39:43.247 --> 39:47.714
El Faziz Assassins give you
something, you take it.

39:47.751 --> 39:49.797
You do not refuse.

40:03.768 --> 40:05.939
I'm looking for Saladin.

40:09.774 --> 40:12.739
Pleased to meet a man of
your great accomplishments.

40:12.777 --> 40:14.573
You run shit here?

40:16.196 --> 40:18.410
There's strength in unity,
brother.

40:19.576 --> 40:22.080
In here we need cooperation
and understanding.

40:23.330 --> 40:25.582
We are at times
discriminated against...

40:25.583 --> 40:28.254
even within these walls.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.088
Now, if you wish to come
and join with us...

40:30.128 --> 40:31.297
Oh!

40:33.590 --> 40:38.558
Brother,
if you don't join with us...

40:38.596 --> 40:41.352
you'll be destroying
the unity we create.

41:24.142 --> 41:26.563
Warden wants to see you.

41:26.603 --> 41:29.359
That's quite a show
you put on there.

41:29.398 --> 41:31.610
Come on. Let's go.

41:35.989 --> 41:37.158
I'm disappointed.

41:37.198 --> 41:40.993
Three incidents already,
one a near riot...

41:40.994 --> 41:43.164
one an assault and now
a physical confrontation...

41:43.204 --> 41:45.166
that has sent five men
to the hospital...

41:45.205 --> 41:46.792
for medical treatment.

41:46.834 --> 41:49.005
You've only been here ten weeks.
It is undeniable...

41:49.006 --> 41:51.716
you are making
a very poor record.

41:51.755 --> 41:54.135
The whole thing is,
they got to respect you...

41:54.173 --> 41:56.303
or you nothin'.

41:56.384 --> 41:57.594
I believe that
you're missing the point.

41:57.635 --> 41:59.180
The warden is trying
to explain the idea...

41:59.221 --> 42:00.640
of acceptable behavior.

42:02.766 --> 42:06.148
I'm trying to explain to him
how to survive.

42:06.186 --> 42:08.148
I don't think there
are too many inmates here...

42:08.188 --> 42:11.153
who could challenge you
physically, Mr. Chambers.

42:11.191 --> 42:14.156
You really don't understand.

42:14.193 --> 42:18.745
When you're the champ,
everybody wants a piece of you.

42:18.783 --> 42:21.079
Everybodyâ€™s testing you.

42:21.118 --> 42:26.545
My whole life, I got a problem,
I take care of it with these.

42:26.582 --> 42:29.379
People love a guy who can fight.

42:29.419 --> 42:34.047
Money, pussy, kiss your ass,
put you on TV...

42:34.048 --> 42:36.218
put your picture
in papers, magazines...

42:36.258 --> 42:40.054
anything I want, because people
love a guy who can fight...

42:40.055 --> 42:41.975
and don't take shit.

43:29.772 --> 43:32.193
Who I'm with is none
of your business!

43:32.233 --> 43:33.945
None of my business?
I'll deal with you...

43:33.986 --> 43:36.281
Stop it!
You're killing him!

43:41.617 --> 43:44.665
On the night
of December 1, 1990...

43:44.705 --> 43:47.623
you beat a man to death
with your bare fists...

43:47.624 --> 43:49.586
which because
of your profession...

43:49.626 --> 43:51.088
and your training
are considered...

43:51.128 --> 43:54.175
to be lethal weapons
in the state of California,

43:54.214 --> 43:56.593
You've been found guilty
by a jury of your peers...

43:56.633 --> 43:58.387
and you are sentenced
to life imprisonment...

43:58.428 --> 44:01.141
without the possibility of parole,

44:08.771 --> 44:11.318
Good morning, Mr. Ripstein.
How are you today?

44:11.357 --> 44:12.944
Don't give me no shit.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.528
How the hell
is the fight comin'?

44:14.569 --> 44:16.072
What fight?

44:16.112 --> 44:19.118
We got the heavyweight
champion of the world...

44:19.158 --> 44:21.746
and an unbeaten prospect
right here in Sweetwater.

44:21.784 --> 44:24.790
Quit wasting time.
Set the fuckin' thing up.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.163
I know fights.

44:26.164 --> 44:29.755
Long prize,
Monroe kicks his ass...

44:29.793 --> 44:31.797
we can make
a lot of money here.

44:33.255 --> 44:37.175
Mr. Ripstein, excuse me,
but you're talking about...

44:37.176 --> 44:40.178
the real heavyweight
champion of the world.

44:40.179 --> 44:42.180
Are you gonna fix the fight?

44:42.181 --> 44:43.767
Shit no. Boxing.

44:43.807 --> 44:47.106
It's a matter of style.
They all can be beaten.

44:47.145 --> 44:50.777
Right time, right place,
the right circumstance...

44:50.814 --> 44:53.862
they all can be beaten.

44:55.861 --> 44:58.115
Mr. Ripstein wants
to see the Iceman...

44:58.156 --> 45:00.118
fight a prisoner
we got in here.

45:00.158 --> 45:02.120
His name is Monroe Hutchen.

45:02.160 --> 45:05.668
And a real goddamn fight. Pure.

45:05.706 --> 45:08.461
So, what do you want us to do?

45:08.500 --> 45:11.631
I talked to the head guard.
He's OK.

45:11.670 --> 45:13.131
But the warden's a problem.

45:13.171 --> 45:15.342
Mr. Ripstein said
you can take care of him.

45:15.382 --> 45:18.550
You know the drill.

45:18.551 --> 45:22.225
You help him or you hurt him.

45:23.391 --> 45:26.229
Now...about Monroe Hutchen.

45:27.561 --> 45:29.147
The warden thinks it's time...

45:29.188 --> 45:31.150
to give him a chance
to rehabilitate himself...

45:31.189 --> 45:33.778
by socializing
with the other prisoners.

45:33.818 --> 45:36.155
In six weeks,
I'm going on vacation.

45:36.195 --> 45:37.698
On the fifth,
I'll be gone for two weeks.

45:37.738 --> 45:39.283
First week in New Orleans...

45:39.323 --> 45:42.371
second week visiting
friends in Tucson, Arizona.

45:42.410 --> 45:43.745
If while I am gone...

45:43.786 --> 45:46.580
if Mr. Hutchen happens to
get into a sparring match...

45:46.581 --> 45:49.169
with Mr. Chambers,
I don't want to hear about it.

45:49.208 --> 45:50.584
And when I get back...

45:50.585 --> 45:53.758
I want this whole goddamned
enterprise finished.

45:53.797 --> 45:54.966
Yes, sir.

45:55.006 --> 45:56.759
Leaving no evidence,
no videotape...

45:56.800 --> 45:59.305
and never to be
spoken of in my presence.

45:59.344 --> 46:00.931
-Anything else, sir?
-Hit the yard.

46:00.971 --> 46:02.223
Thank you.

46:05.100 --> 46:06.937
Had to have been somebody
in the governor's office.

46:06.938 --> 46:08.104
Soon as he got the call...

46:08.146 --> 46:09.940
Mr. Backbone stared
arranging his vacation.

46:09.941 --> 46:11.108
Know what that means,
don't you?

46:11.148 --> 46:13.319
This whole load of shit
comes down on you and me.

46:13.359 --> 46:15.029
There is no "you and me."

46:15.068 --> 46:17.114
I'm taking my vacation
right along with the warden.

46:17.154 --> 46:19.074
Well, thank you
for your support.

46:19.114 --> 46:22.120
Oh, come on.
You run the fight program here.

46:22.159 --> 46:24.121
You want this to happen.

46:38.593 --> 46:39.968
Here we go, Monroe.

46:39.969 --> 46:42.600
Free at last, free at last.

46:44.182 --> 46:47.773
-I'm not going to Folsom.
-What can I tell you?

46:47.811 --> 46:51.109
Looks like the warden
went and changed his mind.

46:51.148 --> 46:53.110
You get to stay home with us.

46:59.458 --> 47:02.339
Yeah, Operator,
a collect call to Yank Lewis.

47:02.379 --> 47:05.343
No. Yank Lewis.

47:05.382 --> 47:08.638
From George Chambers,
the Iceman.

47:10.679 --> 47:13.351
Yank. Yeah, man, it's me.

47:13.390 --> 47:15.686
Who the hell you think it is?

47:15.726 --> 47:18.898
Get your ass up here
and share the beauty.

47:18.937 --> 47:21.651
Maybe I gotaa ticket
back on the gravy train,

47:21.691 --> 47:23.569
What?
What are you talking about?

47:23.609 --> 47:25.905
Remember your old buddy
from Miami, Mendy Ripstein?

47:25.945 --> 47:27.364
Yeah,

47:27.405 --> 47:29.367
His boy came up to me
and said...

47:29.406 --> 47:31.368
that if I fight
some punk in here...

47:31.409 --> 47:33.371
he could maybe
get me out quick.

47:33.411 --> 47:38.379
If Mendy Ripstein says it,
then it's the real deal.

47:38.416 --> 47:40.795
But you can't hear this
from some other guy.

47:40.835 --> 47:43.256
You gotta hear this
from Mendy himself.

47:43.296 --> 47:44.799
Then it's dope for sure.

47:44.840 --> 47:47.721
If it's on the real,
I'll whip on this punk's ass...

47:47.759 --> 47:49.386
and be out of here.

47:49.427 --> 47:52.680
Who's the punk?
Don't tell me Monroe Hutchen.

47:52.681 --> 47:56.397
He fought out of Oakland.
He was undefeated.

47:56.434 --> 48:00.150
He was a real prospect, man.
He's a full load.

48:00.189 --> 48:03.278
Even if he was something,
he's been in here for ten years.

48:03.318 --> 48:06.616
I'm just saying it might not be
a walk in the park.

48:06.654 --> 48:08.863
-I don't believe this shit.
-What?

48:08.864 --> 48:10.701
You worried about me
being out of shape.

48:10.702 --> 48:12.035
I've been in here
for four months.

48:12.076 --> 48:13.663
That chump been in here
for ten years.

48:13.703 --> 48:16.541
-You too much, man.
-What? That's concern...

48:16.581 --> 48:18.167
Get the fuck outta here.

48:21.044 --> 48:23.378
Yes, I want you to fight him,

48:23.379 --> 48:28.263
In the cage, no gloves,
bare-fisted, to the finish,

48:28.301 --> 48:31.182
I make a couple of calls,
I put down some money...

48:31.221 --> 48:32.848
There's some people
on the outside...

48:32.889 --> 48:35.725
that know you,
everybody knows him...

48:35.726 --> 48:38.440
we'll get maybe twenty,
thirty-to-one odds,

48:38.479 --> 48:41.610
It's easy to spread around,
maybe two hundred thousand,

48:41.648 --> 48:46.532
You win, that's
four million bucks, maybe more.

48:48.739 --> 48:52.454
And I think he can't wait.

48:55.413 --> 48:57.248
What's in it for me?

48:57.249 --> 48:58.793
Mr. Ripstein
uses his influence...

48:58.833 --> 49:00.837
you stay out of solitar...

49:00.875 --> 49:02.879
get the privileges
you been missing.

49:02.920 --> 49:06.553
Privileges?

49:06.590 --> 49:08.720
Offer me half the profit,

49:08.759 --> 49:10.345
Oh, I don't think so.

49:10.386 --> 49:13.977
I'm putting up all the dough
on a real long shot.

49:14.015 --> 49:15.642
I'm taking all the risk.

49:15.683 --> 49:17.437
What are you worried
about money for?

49:17.438 --> 49:19.564
What are you gonna buy in here?

49:19.603 --> 49:22.359
You in here, too.

49:22.398 --> 49:24.444
Probably gonna die in here.

49:24.484 --> 49:26.697
What the money matter to you?

49:26.737 --> 49:29.158
You're gonna get ten percent.

49:29.198 --> 49:31.369
I know that fighters
usually get...

49:31.408 --> 49:33.787
fifty percent, minimum,
on the outside.

49:33.827 --> 49:37.623
Yeah, but we're not outside.

49:37.624 --> 49:39.501
I want more.

49:41.418 --> 49:43.380
I got a sister,
she got three kids...

49:43.421 --> 49:45.797
no job, no skills, no husband.

49:45.798 --> 49:49.680
Government gives her
a check once a month.

49:49.718 --> 49:51.680
I could send her the money.

49:51.720 --> 49:56.730
You're gonna get thirty percent
of everything we win.

49:56.768 --> 49:58.688
It's a deal?

49:58.728 --> 50:00.732
Forty percent.

50:00.772 --> 50:02.442
That's it.

50:18.456 --> 50:20.627
You wanted to see the Iceman?

50:20.668 --> 50:22.755
Mr. Ripstein thanks you
for bringing him...

50:22.795 --> 50:24.256
to this neutral location.

50:28.717 --> 50:31.305
The Iceman doesn't want
any disappointments.

50:31.345 --> 50:34.184
He expects to negotiate.

50:35.809 --> 50:36.978
You have to understand...

50:37.018 --> 50:39.648
that Mr. Ripstein is
a great boxing enthusiast...

50:39.687 --> 50:41.774
a great student of the art...

50:41.815 --> 50:44.444
a great historian
of the prize ring.

50:44.484 --> 50:46.780
Mr. Ripstein
believes the truest...

50:46.819 --> 50:48.781
purest expression
of the sport...

50:48.821 --> 50:51.785
was the bare-knuckle fights
of the Nineteenth Century...

50:51.825 --> 50:53.662
the Queensbury rules.

50:53.702 --> 50:57.459
Oh, no, no.
The London Prize Ring rules.

50:57.497 --> 51:01.797
Queensbury changed the rules
to the ones that we got now.

51:01.835 --> 51:04.214
Look, let's cut through
all this bullshit.

51:04.254 --> 51:06.591
I want out.
Otherwise, no fight.

51:06.631 --> 51:08.051
How you gonna pull it off?

51:09.759 --> 51:12.390
We handle that through
the Department of Corrections.

51:12.429 --> 51:13.889
We got a guy on the committee.

51:17.268 --> 51:19.230
I got your word on this?

51:20.854 --> 51:23.693
You better get ready to fight.

51:51.887 --> 51:54.183
The fight is six weeks
from tomorrow night.

51:54.222 --> 51:56.561
Y'all got that amount of time
to get your fighters in shape.

51:56.600 --> 51:58.102
These are the rules.

51:58.143 --> 52:00.105
Mr. Ripstein has gone
through a lot of trouble...

52:00.146 --> 52:01.649
putting them together.

52:01.688 --> 52:04.778
What about a foul?
Who's gonna ref this thing?

52:04.817 --> 52:07.405
There isn't any referee.
That's one of the rules.

52:07.444 --> 52:09.448
What kind of shit is this, huh?

52:09.488 --> 52:12.410
Mr. Mercker can judge fouls
from outside the cage.

52:12.450 --> 52:13.786
No kicking, butting, low blows.

52:13.826 --> 52:16.206
If you win or lose on a foul,
all deals are off.

52:16.246 --> 52:17.624
This is a bunch of crap, OK?

52:17.625 --> 52:19.960
My guy's got a lot more to lose
than this other chump.

52:19.961 --> 52:22.629
Nowhere to train properly,

52:22.669 --> 52:26.342
First there's no gloves,
then these dumbass rules.

52:26.381 --> 52:29.345
Truth is, we don't know shit
about fighting this way.

52:29.384 --> 52:30.929
And that makes you even.

53:27.862 --> 53:30.529
Mr. Ripstein, I don't
want to cause no trouble,

53:30.530 --> 53:33.036
I wanted to talk to you
about the rules, you know?

53:33.075 --> 53:34.411
Actually, about the gloves.

53:34.452 --> 53:35.704
There aren't any gloves.

53:35.705 --> 53:37.331
It says so on page three
of the rules.

53:37.371 --> 53:40.836
Yeah, I know,
but it'll make for a dull fight.

53:40.874 --> 53:43.546
I mean, bare knuckles,
nobody throws a lot.

53:43.586 --> 53:45.088
If you watch those old films...

53:45.129 --> 53:48.093
of Jack Johnson
and Jeffries and Cornet...

53:48.132 --> 53:50.929
Those guys were trained
in bare-knuckle style, you know?

53:50.968 --> 53:53.932
It was like a news flash
when somebody threw a punch.

53:53.971 --> 53:55.766
I just want to make it
clear that I agree...

53:55.806 --> 53:57.310
but my boy?
He don't give a shit.

53:57.350 --> 53:58.978
Gloves, no gloves,
it don't matter.

53:59.018 --> 54:01.728
Bring him on.
We ain't backing up for nobody.

54:01.729 --> 54:03.358
Jab, baby! That's right, jab!

54:03.398 --> 54:05.861
Be a lot more
hitting with gloves.

54:05.900 --> 54:08.112
I gave you a copy of
the London Prize Fight Rules...

54:08.152 --> 54:10.824
that Mr. Ripstein typed out,
and it says "No gloves."

54:10.864 --> 54:15.373
No. Wait a minute.
He's right.

54:15.409 --> 54:18.792
It's a better fight
with six-ounce gloves.

54:18.830 --> 54:19.999
Get 'em,

54:46.944 --> 54:49.908
Monroe!
How you doing, brother?

54:53.282 --> 54:57.874
First, there's a smile,
then comes a cheap shot, huh?

54:57.912 --> 55:02.292
I guess nobody's dumb enough
to fall for that twice, huh?

55:02.293 --> 55:06.258
You got that right, Mr. Iceman.

55:06.296 --> 55:08.467
You can call me Champ.

55:08.507 --> 55:10.465
Now see, you've been told.

55:10.466 --> 55:14.391
In here, I'm the champ.

55:14.429 --> 55:17.894
You believe that, you must
believe in the tooth fair.

55:17.933 --> 55:20.062
Nobody's backing up.

55:26.318 --> 55:29.741
Hold on, brother.
You gonna get your chance.

55:33.782 --> 55:36.037
Good evening,
I'm Maureen O'Boyle,

55:36.076 --> 55:39.207
Tonight on CNO X's
"The inside Story"...

55:39.246 --> 55:41.417
we'll be talking
with Tawnee Rawlins...

55:41.457 --> 55:42.752
in an exclusive interview...

55:42.792 --> 55:45.213
that will be her
first public statement...

55:45.253 --> 55:47.758
since the sensational
trial and conviction...

55:47.797 --> 55:49.885
of George "Iceman" Chambers...

55:49.923 --> 55:52.346
former heavyweight
champion of the world.

55:52.385 --> 55:53.929
Thanks for being
with us, Tawnee.

55:55.430 --> 55:57.517
I was scared.

55:57.557 --> 56:00.480
I didn't want
to be there anymore.

56:02.396 --> 56:06.905
I... I didn't want
to do nothing with him...

56:06.942 --> 56:10.282
but he wouldn't stop.

56:10.321 --> 56:13.077
This whole thing
is just such a mess.

56:13.115 --> 56:14.701
I've been out of work...

56:14.742 --> 56:16.663
since this
whole thing happened...

56:16.701 --> 56:19.207
and I had to have lots
of doctors and lawyers...

56:19.246 --> 56:20.832
and I got stacks of mail
from people...

56:20.873 --> 56:22.210
saying that they hate me...

56:22.249 --> 56:24.086
because I took away
their heavyweight champ...

56:24.126 --> 56:25.880
and that I'm a gold digger
and all that...

56:25.881 --> 56:28.425
but I say
walk a mile in my shoes.

56:28.465 --> 56:30.719
I did not want
to cause him any harm...

56:30.759 --> 56:33.556
but he wouldn't listen to me,
and he wouldn't stop.

56:39.852 --> 56:43.567
These dumb shits been watching
too many old prison movies.

57:05.419 --> 57:06.713
You get on the horn.

57:06.755 --> 57:08.591
Get me a situation red in here.

57:09.799 --> 57:12.179
Central security,
this is the mess hall.

57:12.219 --> 57:15.726
We have a situation red.
Repeat, a situation red.

57:15.763 --> 57:18.394
We've got a situation,
Get down to the mess,

57:19.892 --> 57:23.817
On the double, all right?
Riot's coming down,

57:27.735 --> 57:28.987
Hey, Iceman!

57:31.447 --> 57:33.409
Hey, Iceman.

57:33.449 --> 57:35.286
Before you came here...

57:35.326 --> 57:37.914
we all figured
you were some kind of dude.

57:37.953 --> 57:41.418
Then you show up
actin' like you're the God...

57:41.457 --> 57:42.917
and we're the sod,

57:42.957 --> 57:44.919
Well, hey, man,
ever dog in here...

57:44.959 --> 57:46.671
wanted to see you
get your ass kicked,

57:46.712 --> 57:48.257
You're goin' down, man!

57:48.297 --> 57:49.549
Shit.

58:09.153 --> 58:10.989
Kick your ass, motherfucker!

58:14.158 --> 58:16.161
Let's go! Move!
Move! Move! Move!

58:25.835 --> 58:27.798
Give 'em one!
Take out the ceiling!

58:29.799 --> 58:31.510
Again!

58:46.441 --> 58:48.737
He cancelled the fight,

58:48.777 --> 58:52.827
Jesus fuckin' Christ,
this fuckin' state.

58:52.863 --> 58:55.076
Who the fuck
does this fuckin' warden...

58:55.116 --> 58:56.786
fuckin' think he is?

58:56.827 --> 59:00.792
Doesn't anybody know how to do
business in this fuckin' state?

59:00.830 --> 59:04.754
My fuckin' wife and her fuckin'
asthma and allergies.

59:04.793 --> 59:07.382
We had to move
to the fuckin' desert.

59:07.421 --> 59:10.134
Goddamn fuckin'
chickenshit doctors...

59:10.173 --> 59:13.179
I should've known better than
listen to those shitheels.

59:13.218 --> 59:15.515
Fuckin' Palm Springs...

59:15.555 --> 59:18.561
Lay there in the fuckin' sun
and do nothin'.

59:18.599 --> 59:21.731
Then this fuckin' state
grabs my ass for taxes.

59:21.769 --> 59:24.859
Why the fuck I didn't stay
in fuckin' Florida...

59:24.897 --> 59:28.275
where people know how
to do fuckin' business.

59:28.276 --> 59:31.490
Fuckin' wife
and her fuckin' asthma.

59:31.529 --> 59:35.620
Shit,

59:35.699 --> 59:40.120
Somethin' needs
to get fuckin' done...

59:40.121 --> 59:42.125
I gotta do it myself.

59:44.125 --> 59:49.302
Call the fuckin' warden.
I wanna meet him.

59:50.758 --> 59:52.720
Yes, sir, Mr. Ripstein.

01:00:07.733 --> 01:00:09.779
I don't make it a habit
of meeting with prisoners.

01:00:09.818 --> 01:00:11.947
I'm doing this out of deference
to Mr. Mercker here...

01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:13.949
who thought
it'd be a good idea.

01:00:13.989 --> 01:00:17.454
However, any attempt to have me
reinstate the fight...

01:00:17.493 --> 01:00:20.248
between Mr. Chambers and
Monroe Hutchen will be futile.

01:00:20.288 --> 01:00:23.086
It has been
irrevocably cancelled.

01:00:23.124 --> 01:00:27.002
Can I tell you a story?
One of my favorites.

01:00:27.003 --> 01:00:29.049
It's about how things get done.

01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:32.094
This is a story that
takes place in about...

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:34.513
it must've been
the middle 1950s.

01:00:34.552 --> 01:00:38.644
I was second in charge
of certain operations...

01:00:38.682 --> 01:00:42.188
second to a Mr. Meyer Lansky.

01:00:42.227 --> 01:00:46.652
There was this casino...
a new one...

01:00:46.691 --> 01:00:49.529
that had been built
in a neighboring town.

01:00:49.567 --> 01:00:55.865
But the mayor, he wanted
to close that casino...

01:00:55.866 --> 01:00:59.791
because he did not
like gambling.

01:00:59.829 --> 01:01:03.837
He thought it brought
the wrong kind of people.

01:01:03.874 --> 01:01:07.381
So he ordered
the casino closed. Ohh.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.345
I had to report this
to Mr. Lansky.

01:01:12.383 --> 01:01:15.472
So Mr. Lansky,
he told me, he says...

01:01:15.511 --> 01:01:17.473
"You tell that mayor...

01:01:17.513 --> 01:01:21.438
"that the casino stays open,
no question"...

01:01:21.476 --> 01:01:25.396
but that the mayor
had a choice.

01:01:25.397 --> 01:01:32.494
He could choose to be killed,
or he could choose to have...

01:01:32.529 --> 01:01:36.746
a great deal of money
deposited in his bank account.

01:01:36.783 --> 01:01:40.666
It was his choice.

01:01:40.705 --> 01:01:46.090
In either case,
the casino stays open.

01:01:47.419 --> 01:01:49.421
What happened to the mayor?

01:01:49.422 --> 01:01:50.716
He died,

01:01:50.756 --> 01:01:57.060
He hit his ignition and his car
exploded like a fireball.

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:01.395
You're gonna stand there and
let this hoodlum threaten me?

01:02:01.434 --> 01:02:06.611
Well, sir, I don't much
want my car to blow up.

01:02:06.648 --> 01:02:08.652
We could
talk about the money...

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.943
when you come back
from your vacation.

01:02:10.944 --> 01:02:14.326
I understand
you're leaving tomorrow?

01:02:14.364 --> 01:02:17.328
All of us, we hope
you and your family...

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.663
have a very pleasant time.

01:02:42.978 --> 01:02:44.689
Time!

01:02:44.728 --> 01:02:47.275
We're gonna limo over
a few guys from Vegas...

01:02:47.315 --> 01:02:49.361
act as witnesses.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.406
Chuy, we've been talkin'.

01:02:52.445 --> 01:02:54.574
We need you
to go to the Iceman.

01:02:54.614 --> 01:02:55.823
Get a number.

01:02:55.824 --> 01:02:57.995
We're gettin' a hell
of a price on Monroe.

01:02:58.034 --> 01:03:00.247
We need the Iceman
to go for it.

01:03:00.285 --> 01:03:03.583
Ask him to lie down?
I don't see it.

01:03:03.624 --> 01:03:05.127
Offer him a million.

01:03:05.166 --> 01:03:07.797
He made $25 million the last
time he fought somebody.

01:03:07.836 --> 01:03:10.465
-He had to fight for that one.
-Talk to him.

01:03:10.505 --> 01:03:11.841
You got it wrong.

01:03:11.881 --> 01:03:13.885
You hired me
to look after Mendy.

01:03:13.925 --> 01:03:15.804
I'm looking after him
right now.

01:03:15.844 --> 01:03:17.764
Mendy wants a straight fight.
It's not the money.

01:03:17.805 --> 01:03:21.020
Bullshit! In New York,
in Cuba, in Florida...

01:03:21.058 --> 01:03:23.856
his whole life,
it's always about the money.

01:03:23.894 --> 01:03:25.857
He's got it stashed
all over the place.

01:03:25.896 --> 01:03:27.483
Fuckin' millions.

01:03:27.523 --> 01:03:29.944
He's got ever fuckin'
nickel he ever made.

01:03:29.984 --> 01:03:32.280
With Mendy,
it's always about the money.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:34.490
You guys are way off
Mendy's radar on this deal...

01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:36.200
and I don't want
to mess it up for him.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:39.079
Mendy wants a straight fight
to the finish, and that's it.

01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:41.915
You want the Iceman to dump?
You go talk to him.

01:03:41.954 --> 01:03:44.000
But don't get your hopes up.

01:03:48.337 --> 01:03:51.593
OK, Monroe, now that
this thing is back on...

01:03:51.631 --> 01:03:54.512
here's the deal.
We got a guy in the dispensary.

01:03:54.551 --> 01:03:58.308
He's gonna steal five or ten
Valiums, crush 'em up.

01:03:58.347 --> 01:04:01.186
And I got another guy
in the commissar.

01:04:01.224 --> 01:04:04.689
Last meal Iceman eats before
he fights, we mix it in.

01:04:04.727 --> 01:04:08.610
Just enough to slow him down,
fuck him up.

01:04:08.649 --> 01:04:12.740
Now, he'll still fight,
but he won't be the same.

01:04:12.778 --> 01:04:15.032
That'll be just enough
to give you the edge.

01:04:15.072 --> 01:04:16.533
You got it?

01:04:16.574 --> 01:04:21.793
You do that, I'm gonna
break you up into pieces.

01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:26.673
I can take this guy,
and I don't need no help.

01:04:26.709 --> 01:04:28.919
You understand that?

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.965
Hey! We're just trying
to give you...

01:04:31.006 --> 01:04:32.634
a little something extra, man.

01:04:32.674 --> 01:04:34.552
We got a lot of money
on this table.

01:04:42.433 --> 01:04:45.063
I may not be a real good guy...

01:04:45.103 --> 01:04:51.365
but I ain't no chickenshit,
either. You remember that.

01:04:53.696 --> 01:04:55.365
Take him down.

01:05:29.524 --> 01:05:33.866
OK. We got ourselves
ninety minutes.

01:05:33.903 --> 01:05:37.745
We just concentrate. We focus.

01:05:37.783 --> 01:05:40.914
We mentally imagine
ourselves winning.

01:05:40.953 --> 01:05:45.880
Just close your eyes.
We concentrate.

01:05:45.916 --> 01:05:48.379
We see ourselves winning.

01:05:48.419 --> 01:05:51.425
We see Iceman all beat to shit.

01:05:51.464 --> 01:05:53.802
We see ourselves winning.

01:05:57.886 --> 01:06:00.475
In twenty minutes,
we star to loosen up, OK?

01:06:00.514 --> 01:06:01.848
Break a sweat.

01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:05.105
We don't want this shithead
to catch you cold.

01:06:05.144 --> 01:06:08.943
Hey, you get sloppy,
that's when mistakes happen.

01:06:15.615 --> 01:06:19.163
All right,
cell blocks A, B, C, and D...

01:06:19.201 --> 01:06:21.205
if all y'all
are ready over there...

01:06:21.244 --> 01:06:24.584
let's star movin' em in
on fifteen-minute intervals.

01:06:36.051 --> 01:06:38.097
Let's get the fighters in here!

01:06:42.767 --> 01:06:45.856
Tear it up, Monroe, tear it up!
Yeah.

01:06:45.895 --> 01:06:49.360
He's shit! Iceman is shit!
He is shit! Yeah.

01:06:50.566 --> 01:06:54.199
That's it, that's it!
That's my man! Go!

01:06:54.237 --> 01:06:56.199
Go ahead, now!

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.953
Yeah, let it go,
let it go, let it go!

01:07:16.969 --> 01:07:20.930
And now,
Sweetwater's the Gat Boyz...

01:07:20.931 --> 01:07:24.271
will sing the national anthem!

01:07:52.881 --> 01:07:55.010
You're livin'. You're hot.

01:07:55.050 --> 01:07:56.887
Just listen to 'em. Yeah.

01:07:56.926 --> 01:07:59.849
He is a guest,
and this is your house!

01:07:59.888 --> 01:08:01.600
He is an unwelcome guest.

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:17.491
Go ahead, baby!

01:08:18.741 --> 01:08:20.118
Yeah, let it go! Let it go!

01:08:23.953 --> 01:08:26.877
He don't look good.
He's ugly.

01:08:43.433 --> 01:08:46.352
It's time! It's time!

01:08:46.353 --> 01:08:48.941
Fighters to the ring!
Fighters to the ring!

01:08:48.981 --> 01:08:52.654
Fight's on! Fight's on!

01:09:18.011 --> 01:09:22.060
Good evening, honored guests,
scumbags, and Mr. Mercker...

01:09:22.098 --> 01:09:24.478
the time is now!

01:09:26.394 --> 01:09:28.524
We got a first here,
my friends...

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:31.944
courtesy of a great man,
whose name I cannot say.

01:09:31.984 --> 01:09:34.404
Fight fans all over the world
are gonna be wishin'...

01:09:34.406 --> 01:09:36.365
they's in the bottom
of the barrel with us...

01:09:36.404 --> 01:09:40.330
wishin' Sweetwater Prison
was their home tonight!

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.332
Now pay close attention...

01:09:44.371 --> 01:09:46.375
'cause I'm only
gonna say this once.

01:09:46.415 --> 01:09:48.544
The fight you're about to see
follows a set of rules...

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:50.504
never been used before
around here.

01:09:50.545 --> 01:09:51.796
London Prize Rules:

01:09:51.837 --> 01:09:53.841
No traditional rounds
to speak of...

01:09:53.881 --> 01:09:55.510
no regulation-size gloves...

01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.761
just those bitty six-ounce
suckers gonna tear up.

01:09:58.762 --> 01:10:00.763
A fighter steps from
the mark ready to fight.

01:10:00.764 --> 01:10:03.560
He go down, then he got
sixty seconds to come back.

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:06.480
That's it!
Fight to the finish! No ref!

01:10:06.519 --> 01:10:08.774
All we got is the timekeeper
for the mark!

01:10:08.812 --> 01:10:11.443
Our very own Mr. Mercker,
the walkin' boss.

01:10:13.067 --> 01:10:15.112
Now put your hands together,
my friends...

01:10:15.153 --> 01:10:17.032
for our favorite son...

01:10:17.072 --> 01:10:19.452
Sweetwater's
defending champion...

01:10:19.492 --> 01:10:21.411
undefeated,
with a prison record...

01:10:21.451 --> 01:10:26.460
of 68 wins, no losses,
weighing in at 199 pounds...

01:10:26.498 --> 01:10:28.711
wearing the burgundy trunks
with the black trim...

01:10:28.751 --> 01:10:31.798
Monroe...Monroe...

01:10:31.837 --> 01:10:34.842
Monroe Hutchen!

01:10:34.881 --> 01:10:37.387
Monroe Hutchen!
Monroe Hutchen!

01:10:38.844 --> 01:10:40.682
Now give it up
for the west corner.

01:10:40.721 --> 01:10:43.936
He's also undefeated...
on the outside.

01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:45.520
Weighing in at 205...

01:10:45.559 --> 01:10:48.774
the former heavyweight
champion of the world...

01:10:48.813 --> 01:10:51.777
George "Iceman" Chambers!

01:10:51.816 --> 01:10:53.026
Come on, motherfucker!

01:10:53.068 --> 01:10:55.656
There's only
one thing I got to say...

01:10:55.696 --> 01:10:57.407
put his ass
between his shoulders!

01:10:57.446 --> 01:10:59.952
OK, brother cons, we are ready!

01:10:59.992 --> 01:11:02.204
Now, don't let your passion
for the great Monroe...

01:11:02.244 --> 01:11:05.792
interfere with good judgment,
and don't do nothin' stupid!

01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:07.292
That'll forfeit
all the money...

01:11:07.332 --> 01:11:08.960
that you guys bet
at those big odds.

01:11:09.001 --> 01:11:11.673
And welcome to our amigos
from Las Vegas...

01:11:11.712 --> 01:11:13.882
here to witness this contest
and report it...

01:11:13.922 --> 01:11:15.968
to various cities
all around our great country,

01:11:16.008 --> 01:11:17.720
Whole lotta bookmakers
out there want to know...

01:11:17.759 --> 01:11:19.095
what's comin' down.

01:11:19.136 --> 01:11:21.432
Well, it's us against
the world, my brothers,

01:11:21.471 --> 01:11:24.812
And just like you, I too am
for the great Monroe Hutchen!

01:11:24.851 --> 01:11:26.938
He brought honor
to our house of pain...

01:11:26.978 --> 01:11:28.731
but I will call
a neutral fight.

01:11:28.770 --> 01:11:30.607
Come on, bitch.

01:11:30.648 --> 01:11:32.402
This is the fight
for what's right,

01:11:32.442 --> 01:11:33.944
This is the brawl for it all!

01:11:33.984 --> 01:11:35.154
This fight ain't about money!

01:11:35.194 --> 01:11:36.864
This is their
heavyweight champion...

01:11:36.903 --> 01:11:38.532
against our
heavyweight champion!

01:11:38.573 --> 01:11:42.534
This fight is for respeck!
R-e-s-p-e-c-k!

01:11:42.535 --> 01:11:43.746
Respeck!

01:11:46.456 --> 01:11:48.209
Round one! Round one!

01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:52.339
And here we go, baby.

01:11:54.131 --> 01:11:56.177
They move
to the center of the ring...

01:11:56.216 --> 01:11:57.970
feelin' each other out,

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.727
You gotta remember something:

01:12:04.767 --> 01:12:06.729
Monroe is
a forty-to-one underdog...

01:12:06.769 --> 01:12:09.106
goin' up against the Iceman,
a great champion,

01:12:11.565 --> 01:12:15.113
Combinations, man!
Combinations!

01:12:15.152 --> 01:12:17.323
Monroe swings and misses,
Iceman counters...

01:12:17.363 --> 01:12:18.699
with a hard right hand
to the head!

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:21.829
-That's it, baby, come on!
-Hit that big motherfucker!

01:12:23.244 --> 01:12:25.578
Monroe's
backpedaling, circling,

01:12:25.579 --> 01:12:26.956
Doesn't look
like he's too willing...

01:12:26.998 --> 01:12:30.713
to trade punches
with the Iceman,

01:12:30.751 --> 01:12:33.298
Watch it, Monroe,
watch it, now, baby!

01:12:37.842 --> 01:12:39.178
Lookin' for a way
to get to Monroe,

01:12:39.219 --> 01:12:41.473
Now he's tauntin' him!
He's tauntin' Monroe!

01:12:41.513 --> 01:12:43.557
He's taunting him!
Monroe swings,

01:12:43.598 --> 01:12:45.351
The Iceman hits him
with a hard right...

01:12:45.392 --> 01:12:46.687
and a left to Monroe's head!

01:12:46.726 --> 01:12:48.688
You ain't hurt him!
You ain't hurt him!

01:12:48.728 --> 01:12:50.399
Hey, bullshit!

01:12:51.731 --> 01:12:53.235
Oh, Monroe misses...

01:12:53.275 --> 01:12:54.988
and the Iceman tags him
with a hard left hand...

01:12:55.027 --> 01:12:56.947
and Monroe
is going backwards, baby,

01:12:56.987 --> 01:12:58.991
The Iceman tauntin' him on,

01:13:01.951 --> 01:13:03.413
Get in his face!
Get in his face!

01:13:06.789 --> 01:13:10.004
Monroe lands an overhand right!
Now a combination!

01:13:10.042 --> 01:13:13.294
Monroe's getting himself
into this fight!

01:13:13.295 --> 01:13:15.383
The Iceman counters with
a hard right to the face,

01:13:15.423 --> 01:13:16.675
Another right to the head,

01:13:18.135 --> 01:13:20.889
Monroe is fast, but the Iceman
is much stronger,

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:24.305
They hook up again! Both men
exchanging combinations!

01:13:24.306 --> 01:13:27.563
Right hand!
Left! Right! Right!

01:13:27.602 --> 01:13:31.485
And boom!
The Iceman drives Monroe back!

01:13:34.609 --> 01:13:37.114
Make him bleed, man,
make him bleed!

01:13:40.489 --> 01:13:42.618
Both men throw combinations!

01:13:42.658 --> 01:13:45.331
Left! Right! Overhand right!

01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:49.461
Monroe misses,
The Iceman comes back...

01:13:49.499 --> 01:13:51.295
with a right-left to the head!

01:13:51.335 --> 01:13:53.255
Get him!

01:13:53.296 --> 01:13:55.592
They're fighting
at an incredible pace!

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:58.136
Can you believe it?

01:13:59.217 --> 01:14:01.178
Nice overhand right by Monroe!

01:14:01.179 --> 01:14:04.853
Iceman's not hurt, but he
ties Monroe up in a clinch!

01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:09.272
Oh, shit, baby! Go get him!

01:14:11.857 --> 01:14:13.234
Hard right hand!

01:14:13.274 --> 01:14:14.986
Yeah! Another one! Move!

01:14:15.026 --> 01:14:16.612
Monroe swings and misses...

01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:18.448
and the Iceman
keeps hurting' him...

01:14:18.488 --> 01:14:20.659
with an overhand right,

01:14:20.698 --> 01:14:22.952
Combination, right-left!

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:24.829
Big left hook!

01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:27.459
A right and a left
to the stomach,

01:14:27.498 --> 01:14:29.502
Another left...
oh, an uppercut!

01:14:29.541 --> 01:14:31.169
And Monroe is down!

01:14:31.209 --> 01:14:32.671
Sixty seconds!

01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:35.634
And we now know why
he's the heavyweight champion...

01:14:35.674 --> 01:14:37.343
of the world.

01:14:37.383 --> 01:14:40.180
Huh? Huh? Huh?

01:14:40.219 --> 01:14:42.306
Huh? What? What?

01:14:42.346 --> 01:14:44.223
And Monroe is up!

01:14:44.224 --> 01:14:46.561
Looks like he will continue,

01:14:48.686 --> 01:14:50.147
Hey, Iceman, you ain't shit!

01:14:50.188 --> 01:14:52.149
You just got robbed!

01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:54.151
The Iceman's straight-ahead,
locomotive style...

01:14:54.191 --> 01:14:55.986
may be a little too much
for Monroe,

01:14:56.026 --> 01:14:58.490
He's never had to face
anything like this,

01:14:58.530 --> 01:15:00.449
-Boo!
-Fuck!

01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:03.287
-Boo!
-Come on, big daddy!

01:15:03.325 --> 01:15:05.079
The Iceman's in his corner...

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.455
a mighty confident man,

01:15:06.495 --> 01:15:08.708
That's what you gotta do!
Let's go!

01:15:08.747 --> 01:15:11.128
Monroe's trademark of
occasionally switching...

01:15:11.168 --> 01:15:12.879
to a southpaw
left-hand style...

01:15:12.919 --> 01:15:14.506
ain't workin' so far, baby!

01:15:14.546 --> 01:15:16.258
Ten seconds!
Fighters to the line!

01:15:16.298 --> 01:15:18.678
Fighters to the line!
Clear the ring!

01:15:19.968 --> 01:15:21.513
Pucker up, motherfucker.

01:15:21.554 --> 01:15:22.764
Clear the ring!

01:15:24.515 --> 01:15:26.936
Round Two!

01:15:28.018 --> 01:15:29.562
And here we go, baby!

01:15:29.604 --> 01:15:31.357
Despite the knockdown,
Monroe looks...

01:15:31.397 --> 01:15:34.194
like he's pulled himself
back together,

01:15:40.906 --> 01:15:42.744
The Iceman misses...

01:15:42.783 --> 01:15:44.996
and Monroe lands
an overhand right!

01:15:48.415 --> 01:15:50.502
Right hand! Right hand!

01:15:50.542 --> 01:15:52.755
A quick-hit exchange!

01:15:52.794 --> 01:15:55.090
Now this is boxing!
Hard combinations...

01:15:55.129 --> 01:15:57.885
and they clinch!
Beautiful! Beautiful!

01:16:02.262 --> 01:16:04.475
Ooh, what a right hand
by the Iceman!

01:16:04.514 --> 01:16:07.145
Another right to the head,
Monroe misses...

01:16:07.185 --> 01:16:09.105
and pays for it dearly
to the body...

01:16:09.145 --> 01:16:10.606
and he reels back
from the punishment...

01:16:10.645 --> 01:16:12.107
given to him by the Iceman,

01:16:12.148 --> 01:16:14.736
Another hard right and left,
and Monroe is on his heels!

01:16:14.775 --> 01:16:16.069
He's up against the fence!

01:16:16.109 --> 01:16:17.780
The Iceman
is going for the body!

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:19.658
Another one to the body,
and it doesn't look good...

01:16:19.659 --> 01:16:21.576
for Sweetwaterâ€™s
own favorite son,

01:16:21.616 --> 01:16:24.993
The Iceman's all over him!
He's tearin' Monroe up!

01:16:24.994 --> 01:16:26.956
Oh, another right to the head!

01:16:26.996 --> 01:16:30.461
Monroe's down, and he's dizzy
as a motherfucker!

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.589
He's talkin' shit, baby!
He's talkin' shit!

01:16:33.628 --> 01:16:35.465
Who the hell you think...
I know he ain't talkin' to me,

01:16:35.505 --> 01:16:36.632
He's talkin' to y'all!

01:16:36.673 --> 01:16:39.303
That's right! Yeah! Uh-huh!

01:16:39.343 --> 01:16:42.014
Monroe's wobbly, He's shaky,

01:16:42.053 --> 01:16:44.809
There's no question about it,
Monroe is hurt!

01:16:44.848 --> 01:16:46.309
Come on! Come on!

01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:49.731
Don't get careless.
Knock him on his ass!

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:52.021
Now take a whiff of this.
Come on.

01:16:52.022 --> 01:16:53.856
This fight is far from over.

01:16:53.857 --> 01:16:55.778
You're gonna get him.
We got plenty of time.

01:16:55.819 --> 01:16:58.490
He just loves
to taunt the crowd,

01:16:58.529 --> 01:17:00.616
He's got everything
going his way,

01:17:00.656 --> 01:17:03.328
Oh, that Iceman is
one cocky son of a bitch,

01:17:03.367 --> 01:17:06.123
He's already knocked
him down twice, Eddie!

01:17:06.162 --> 01:17:08.082
I don't know how much longer
this has got to go.

01:17:08.122 --> 01:17:09.583
You gotta fight your fight!

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:11.962
You're fightin' his fight.
You control the rhythm.

01:17:12.001 --> 01:17:14.378
You gotta
turn this fight around!

01:17:14.379 --> 01:17:16.382
You can do it, Monroe!
Come on, now!

01:17:16.422 --> 01:17:17.758
This is your round!

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.053
The Iceman lookin'
supremely confident,

01:17:20.093 --> 01:17:21.763
He's got it all goin' his way!

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:24.349
Round three!

01:17:27.559 --> 01:17:29.354
They come out,
and it seems like the Iceman...

01:17:29.394 --> 01:17:31.356
is just trin'
to find that one big shot...

01:17:31.396 --> 01:17:33.150
that'll put Monroe
on his ass...

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.860
and give him a one-way
ticket to Bootyville.

01:17:37.569 --> 01:17:40.198
Oh! A big right hand
by the Iceman!

01:17:41.741 --> 01:17:44.287
And another right hand
by the Iceman!

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:46.288
This can't go much furher!

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:47.789
That's it! That's it!

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:49.876
Come on, Mo! Dance with him!

01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:52.587
Both of these men
are great warriors,

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:55.086
Iceman has a look
of determination in his eye...

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:57.133
but like I said before,
brother scumbags...

01:17:57.173 --> 01:18:01.056
he's lookin' for that big punch
to end it all for Monroe,

01:18:03.763 --> 01:18:06.142
The Iceman is clearly
in control of this fight,

01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:07.685
But Monroe
is still there, baby.

01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:09.812
Our favorite son
is still standin',

01:18:13.690 --> 01:18:15.944
Oh, that right hand just
keeps shakin' Monroe up!

01:18:15.945 --> 01:18:17.946
Stay strong! Stay strong!

01:18:22.074 --> 01:18:24.411
Big left and right
comin' from the Iceman!

01:18:24.451 --> 01:18:26.580
He is all over Monroe!

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:28.374
And the Iceman is on the hunt!

01:18:28.413 --> 01:18:29.789
He's on the prowl!

01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:31.835
He's goin' in for the kill!

01:18:33.627 --> 01:18:36.424
Oh, God!

01:18:36.463 --> 01:18:39.176
What a devastating
left hook from Monroe!

01:18:39.216 --> 01:18:41.261
The Iceman is staggering,
and he's hurt!

01:18:44.304 --> 01:18:46.433
Oh, Monroe hits him
with another shot!

01:18:46.474 --> 01:18:48.896
He's drivin' him
back up against the cage...

01:18:48.935 --> 01:18:50.562
punishing him
with wicked combinations!

01:18:50.603 --> 01:18:52.190
Monroe is all over him!

01:18:56.609 --> 01:18:59.072
He's hurt! He's hurt!
Left, and right!

01:18:59.112 --> 01:19:00.407
Oh, shit.

01:19:00.446 --> 01:19:02.450
Can you believe it?!

01:19:02.491 --> 01:19:05.079
Ohh! And a right hand
puts the Iceman down!

01:19:05.118 --> 01:19:06.913
The Iceman is down...

01:19:06.953 --> 01:19:08.581
for the first time
in his career!

01:19:08.621 --> 01:19:09.873
Sixty seconds!

01:19:09.915 --> 01:19:11.376
Shit!

01:19:11.416 --> 01:19:13.294
This is unbelievable,

01:19:13.335 --> 01:19:14.668
Unbelievable!

01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:16.089
Way to go, Monroe!

01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:17.883
I can't believe it!
The Iceman is down!

01:19:17.923 --> 01:19:21.805
And the Iceman is up,
He's staggerin' around,

01:19:21.843 --> 01:19:24.098
He doesn't know where he is,

01:19:24.139 --> 01:19:27.019
Oh, my God, he's gone
plum-fuckin'-crazy in there!

01:19:27.056 --> 01:19:29.311
The Iceman's gone
absolutely crazy,

01:19:29.352 --> 01:19:31.690
This could be it, This could be
a disqualification,

01:19:31.691 --> 01:19:34.188
Somebody get in there
and stop this thing!

01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:36.193
I got a lotta damn money
ridin' on this!

01:19:42.157 --> 01:19:43.994
Pandemonium! Out of control!

01:19:44.034 --> 01:19:45.745
Pandemonium! Out of control!

01:19:47.203 --> 01:19:49.833
Monroe has definitely
turned this fight around,

01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:54.838
What goes on in the mind
of George "Iceman" Chambers...

01:19:54.878 --> 01:19:56.757
at this moment
is anybody's guess,

01:19:56.796 --> 01:19:58.842
This is one
for the record books, baby,

01:19:58.882 --> 01:20:00.217
People are gonna be talking
about this...

01:20:00.218 --> 01:20:01.553
for the rest of their life,
and if I knew...

01:20:01.554 --> 01:20:03.347
I had to go to jail
to see a fight like this...

01:20:03.386 --> 01:20:05.098
I'd have did a crime
a long time ago!

01:20:05.138 --> 01:20:07.476
This is your night!
This is your house, baby!

01:20:07.515 --> 01:20:10.146
Don't let up! Go at him!
Stick him hard!

01:20:10.185 --> 01:20:13.063
Take him out, baby! Come on!

01:20:13.064 --> 01:20:15.193
Ten seconds!
Fighters to the line!

01:20:15.232 --> 01:20:18.572
You can do it!
Kick his ass!

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:20.781
Let's go, Monroe, let's go!

01:20:22.073 --> 01:20:23.701
That was the toughest round...

01:20:23.741 --> 01:20:25.202
in the Iceman's whole career,

01:20:25.242 --> 01:20:28.207
He must regain momentum,
He must come out strong,

01:20:28.245 --> 01:20:30.208
He must get back in this fight!

01:20:32.166 --> 01:20:35.339
Oh! And he is back!
A left and a right to Monroe!

01:20:39.007 --> 01:20:41.720
Monroe hits him with
a right hand, left hand...

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.097
and another right hand...

01:20:43.098 --> 01:20:45.182
and the Iceman
is forced to clinch!

01:20:45.222 --> 01:20:47.226
Stick him, baby! Go at him now!

01:20:49.267 --> 01:20:51.855
Monroe switches to southpaw!

01:20:56.483 --> 01:20:58.904
They're hookin' up!
Toe to toe!

01:20:58.944 --> 01:21:00.906
Punch for punch!
Back and forth!

01:21:00.947 --> 01:21:03.076
This is a war!

01:21:05.242 --> 01:21:08.248
Oh, my god, what a fight!
And I am so happy...

01:21:08.287 --> 01:21:11.168
that it's happenin' right here
at Sweetwater Prison,

01:21:11.207 --> 01:21:12.418
Let's go, baby!

01:21:12.457 --> 01:21:15.672
He's on the hunt!
Monroe's on the prowl!

01:21:15.712 --> 01:21:18.049
Right hand!
A left to the stomach!

01:21:18.088 --> 01:21:19.508
Overhand right!

01:21:19.549 --> 01:21:21.678
Another left and a right,
and an overhand right...

01:21:21.718 --> 01:21:23.178
to the head!

01:21:24.555 --> 01:21:26.559
Monroe is punishing him...

01:21:26.598 --> 01:21:28.476
with blows to the head
and the body,

01:21:28.477 --> 01:21:31.476
Say what you want to say about
George "Iceman" Chambers...

01:21:31.477 --> 01:21:33.523
but he is dead game!

01:22:10.435 --> 01:22:12.686
It's over! It's over!

01:22:12.687 --> 01:22:15.360
Monroe wins again! It's over!

01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:16.609
It's over!

01:22:16.649 --> 01:22:18.820
That's it! Monroe wins...

01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:22.325
and I just won
a lot of goddamn money!

01:22:23.448 --> 01:22:25.077
Yeah! Yeah!

01:22:25.116 --> 01:22:27.454
You owe me money, Eddie!
You owe me money!

01:22:27.494 --> 01:22:30.416
Monroe! Monroe!

01:22:31.874 --> 01:22:33.877
Yeah! Yeah!

01:22:53.396 --> 01:22:55.608
Monroe! Yeah!

01:23:29.725 --> 01:23:34.146
But this...
this is a thing of beauty.

01:23:34.147 --> 01:23:37.148
A great thing of beauty.

01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:39.571
Two guys
fightin' to the finish...

01:23:39.610 --> 01:23:43.279
but just one guy wins
because he's the better man...

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.746
and that's what
the goddamn sport is about.

01:23:56.669 --> 01:24:00.135
Mendy Ripstein died
3 weeks after the big fight,

01:24:00.174 --> 01:24:03.008
He kept his word,
Monroe got his money...

01:24:03.009 --> 01:24:05.556
and the Iceman got out
on special parole,

01:24:05.596 --> 01:24:07.558
I can personally
thank Mr. Ripstein...

01:24:07.598 --> 01:24:09.142
for another thing,

01:24:09.183 --> 01:24:11.980
His lawyers
contacted my family,

01:24:12.019 --> 01:24:15.067
He left me $2 million,
free and clear,

01:24:15.105 --> 01:24:17.526
So I guess I'm not
gonna have any excuses...

01:24:17.565 --> 01:24:19.904
when I get out of here,

01:24:19.944 --> 01:24:22.783
I read in the sports page
that Iceman and his manager...

01:24:22.821 --> 01:24:25.494
both denied the fight
with Monroe ever happened...

01:24:25.533 --> 01:24:29.083
and the story about him losing
was only a big rumor...

01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.664
a fairy tale,

01:24:30.705 --> 01:24:32.876
Once upon a time in prison,

01:24:38.088 --> 01:24:39.758
Our panel of experts...

01:24:39.798 --> 01:24:42.344
have the fight even
at two rounds apiece,

01:24:42.383 --> 01:24:43.803
Both fighters fighting...

01:24:43.844 --> 01:24:46.265
for the heavyweight
championship of the world...

01:24:46.304 --> 01:24:49.352
the greatest title
in all of sports,

01:24:49.391 --> 01:24:51.603
One thing I can tell you
for sure...

01:24:51.643 --> 01:24:55.567
life in prison hasn't changed
the Iceman's fighting style,

01:24:55.605 --> 01:24:57.898
Both fighters feeling
each other out now,

01:24:57.899 --> 01:24:59.528
Briscoe trying to work the jab,

01:24:59.568 --> 01:25:01.113
He can't get anything in,

01:25:07.159 --> 01:25:09.205
A left to the body!
And here comes Chambers!

01:25:09.244 --> 01:25:10.831
Another right!
A left to the body!

01:25:10.871 --> 01:25:13.042
Right-left combination!
A left! A right!

01:25:13.082 --> 01:25:15.378
A left hook,
and down goes Briscoe!

01:25:15.418 --> 01:25:17.338
Down goes Briscoe!

01:25:17.378 --> 01:25:19.382
Chambers over
to the neutral corner...

01:25:19.422 --> 01:25:22.052
and referee Mathew Kerrigan
is counting it out!

01:25:22.091 --> 01:25:24.804
Briscoe, desperately
trying to stand up,

01:25:24.844 --> 01:25:26.054
He wants to continue,

01:25:27.305 --> 01:25:30.019
Kerrigan has called it off!

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:31.478
And by knockout...

01:25:31.518 --> 01:25:34.064
with one minute, 22 seconds
into the fifth round...

01:25:34.104 --> 01:25:36.233
Right here!
Always was the champ!

01:25:36.272 --> 01:25:38.610
...Briscoe is knocked out,
and the now-undisputed...

01:25:38.611 --> 01:25:40.445
heavyweight champion
of the world...

01:25:40.485 --> 01:25:44.076
is George "Iceman" Chambers!

01:25:47.242 --> 01:25:51.121
Hey, Monroe! Iceman won!

01:25:51.122 --> 01:25:52.791
Guess what, cat?

01:25:52.831 --> 01:25:56.338
They say he's the heavyweight
champ of the whole world!

01:25:56.377 --> 01:25:59.633
Undisputed! Haaaa!

01:25:59.672 --> 01:26:01.258
Monroe!
