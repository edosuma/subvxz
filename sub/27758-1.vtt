-(GASPS) Oh my God! Peter!
-Sweetest.

00:08.225 --> 00:10.059
What?! Who is this?

00:10.476 --> 00:12.434
I'm sorry, I should have grabbed
a bigger towel.

00:13.392 --> 00:15.643
My wife slept
with somebody else today.

00:15.726 --> 00:19.100
-WOMAN: Oh boy,
go write some jokes.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:19.392 --> 00:20.559
Great live comedy tonight.

00:20.643 --> 00:21.726
PETE:
I'm going through a divorce,

00:21.809 --> 00:22.851
I'm kind of floating around.

00:22.934 --> 00:24.100
-Oh, you're homeless.
-No--

00:24.184 --> 00:25.559
-Do you have a home?
-No...

00:25.643 --> 00:27.059
ARTIE LANGE: Don't put your face
in this pillow,

00:27.142 --> 00:28.559
bad shit happened
to this pillow. (CHUCKLES)

00:28.643 --> 00:30.809
PETE HOLMES: So much of my life,
I was afraid of God.

00:30.893 --> 00:32.726
-Maybe I missed out.
-Really? You?

00:32.809 --> 00:34.225
I could use a drink, yeah!

00:34.684 --> 00:36.309
I think you should take me home.

00:37.142 --> 00:39.100
(LAUGHS)

00:39.559 --> 00:40.434
Mmm!

00:40.517 --> 00:42.309
You're the second person
in my entire life

00:42.392 --> 00:44.809
-I've ever made love to.
-Oh my God.

00:45.225 --> 00:46.142
I feel like I sinned.

00:46.434 --> 00:49.267
Ooh, sounds to me like
you are expanding your mind.

00:49.351 --> 00:50.517
The whole point of New York

00:50.601 --> 00:52.434
is you can like bounce around
to different spots.

00:52.601 --> 00:55.184
-He's funny, right?
-He'll be funny in three years.

00:55.934 --> 00:57.392
I'm trying to get
into the college market.

00:57.476 --> 00:59.017
I just submitted a tape to NACA.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.893
NACA changed my life.
I book 80 colleges,

01:01.975 --> 01:02.975
I haven't had a real job since.

01:03.059 --> 01:05.392
-NACA! (CHEERING)
-Aah! (CHEERS)

01:05.476 --> 01:07.267
You've got six so far,
and I'm working on more.

01:07.351 --> 01:08.351
You're my new show pony.

01:08.434 --> 01:10.184
(AUDIENCE CHANTS)
Roast! Roast! Roast!

01:10.643 --> 01:13.059
News flash, Pete.
Jesus isn't coming back,

01:13.267 --> 01:15.559
-and neither is your wife.
-Ooh!

01:15.643 --> 01:17.225
I don't know
how I walk away from that

01:17.309 --> 01:18.267
and just forget it.

01:18.351 --> 01:20.225
What kind of comedian
can't take a joke?

01:20.309 --> 01:23.184
-I don't want to date.
-Nice.

01:23.809 --> 01:26.309
I packed up my stuff,
I can't go back to Artie.

01:26.392 --> 01:28.059
I can't go back to my roommate.

01:28.142 --> 01:30.309
You know what you need to do.
You gotta go back to your life.

01:30.392 --> 01:32.309
Seriously, dude.
You gotta get outta here.

-Okay, but I'm not

03:25.809 --> 03:28.309
Last month,
we had a student
comedy competition

03:28.392 --> 03:30.643
and first prize was
opening for you.

03:31.517 --> 03:33.184

What's up, man?

-Hey. Pete.
-Hey, what's up?

03:44.267 --> 03:46.517
Yeah. Jaboukie.
I saw your YouTube stuff.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.392
-You did?
-Yeah, you're
super funny.

03:48.476 --> 03:50.559
-Oh, I'm so glad
we're doing this.
-Yeah, I'm super excited

03:50.643 --> 03:52.267
that this was able
to, like, work out.

03:52.351 --> 03:55.017
-I don't know if you
had a say in anything.
-No, this was a surprise.

03:55.100 --> 03:56.392
But this is a good surprise.

03:56.476 --> 03:58.893
I've been on the road
for weeks and weeks.

03:58.975 --> 04:00.351
-Oh.
-I'm like just--
I mean,

04:00.434 --> 04:02.392
it's great to do a show
with another comic.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.726
I'm not, like, a professional
comedian or anything.

04:04.809 --> 04:06.059
I'm still kind of new.

04:06.142 --> 04:08.142
-How old are you?
-I'm 20.

04:08.225 --> 04:09.100
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:09.184 --> 04:12.559
Jeez, man...
that's awesome

04:12.643 --> 04:14.768
I'm 33.

04:14.851 --> 04:16.476
Cool.

04:16.559 --> 04:19.934
I feel like more straight
people should use Grindr.

04:20.017 --> 04:22.309
(laughter)

04:22.392 --> 04:25.643
If you don't know
what that is, that's
a gay dating app.

04:25.726 --> 04:28.934
Uh, just because, like,
gay people get a lot of,

04:29.017 --> 04:32.975
like, consent talk
out of the way, up top,
on Grindr, like,

04:33.059 --> 04:34.434
"What are you into?

04:34.517 --> 04:36.100
When was the last time
you were gonna get tested?

04:36.184 --> 04:37.851
Are you the top or the bottom?
Blah, blah, blah."

04:37.934 --> 04:39.601
We, like, establish
a lot up top.

04:39.684 --> 04:42.100
But for straight people
on dating apps,
it's just sort of like,

04:42.184 --> 04:45.351
-"Mmm, I like
pizza and memes."
-(laughter)

04:45.434 --> 04:47.643
Or like, "Here's a picture of me
holding a fish," like...

04:47.726 --> 04:49.601
(laughter)

04:49.684 --> 04:51.434
It took me a while
to come out to my family,

04:51.517 --> 04:52.975
just because
my parents are Jamaican

04:53.059 --> 04:56.434
and homophobia is our
second-best Olympic sport, so...

04:56.517 --> 04:58.684
that definitely
took a minute, um...

04:58.768 --> 05:02.100
But I feel like parents always
kind of know that stuff, though.

05:02.184 --> 05:05.017
And I could tell, because my dad
would give my brothers advice,

05:05.100 --> 05:07.100
and my dad would
tell my brothers,

05:07.184 --> 05:08.934
"Find a gal that
makes you feel

05:09.017 --> 05:12.643
like you don't deserve her,"
which is beautiful.

05:12.726 --> 05:14.643
He would just tell me,
"Don't do cocaine."

05:14.726 --> 05:16.351
(laughter)

05:16.434 --> 05:18.893
And I have, so, like,

05:18.975 --> 05:21.351
what's up, Daddio?
You know? Um...

05:21.434 --> 05:23.517
But also, like, me and my
brothers were just, like,

05:23.601 --> 05:25.809
so different from each
other growing up, like,

05:25.893 --> 05:27.975
both my brothers are,
like, taller than me,

05:28.059 --> 05:29.309
they're fitter than me,

05:29.392 --> 05:31.809
they carry themselves
with confidence, you know?

05:31.893 --> 05:33.267
But I'm like small, pale,

05:33.351 --> 05:36.351
I carry myself like
an inbred European prince.

05:36.434 --> 05:37.975
(laughter)

05:38.059 --> 05:40.309
But I know I'm not ugly.

05:40.392 --> 05:41.643
(laughter)

05:41.726 --> 05:43.267
I know that.

05:43.351 --> 05:45.643
Like, on a one to ten scale,
I don't think I could, like,
model,

05:45.726 --> 05:48.476
but I could definitely end
a Republican senator's career.

05:48.559 --> 05:50.684
(laughter)

05:50.768 --> 05:52.768
Pete:
That was a fucking great set.

05:52.851 --> 05:54.851
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

05:54.934 --> 05:56.643
Thanks, yeah,
I appreciate it.

05:56.726 --> 05:59.267
Dude, what are you
doing in Maryland?

05:59.351 --> 06:01.142
Going to college.

06:01.225 --> 06:03.100
-Yeah, but...
-(chuckles)

06:03.184 --> 06:05.893
You're three hours from
the greatest comedy scene...

06:05.975 --> 06:07.517
-In the world.
-...in the world.

06:07.601 --> 06:08.684
Orlando, Florida.

06:08.768 --> 06:11.934
(laughing)
No, no! Manhattan!

06:12.017 --> 06:13.768
You're three hours
from Manhattan, you should--

06:13.851 --> 06:15.476
How often are you getting up?

06:15.559 --> 06:18.517
-Like once or twice a month.
-That-- that's what I'm saying.

06:18.601 --> 06:20.809
So you're this good
going up that infrequently?

06:20.893 --> 06:24.643
Imagine how good you'll get
when you're really doing it.

06:24.726 --> 06:26.434
It's all who you know.

06:26.517 --> 06:28.100
You know, you ever
get to the city, look me up.

06:28.184 --> 06:30.601
I-- I can save you
five years of bullshit,

06:30.684 --> 06:32.225
get you in the right places.

06:32.309 --> 06:36.059
-Anytime, really.
-I'm serious.

06:36.142 --> 06:37.601
So am I.

06:37.684 --> 06:39.559
I'm not doing shit here,
like, truly.

06:39.643 --> 06:42.601
I'm majoring in Philosophy,
like, I don't fucking do
anything.

06:42.684 --> 06:47.601
-I made three Pringles bongs
this week, alone.
-That's kind of impressive.

06:47.684 --> 06:50.309
Thank you, I feel
like I'm in prison.
(laughs)

06:50.392 --> 06:53.184
I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
You want a ride, you can--

06:53.267 --> 06:56.351
I have a place.
You can crash at my place,
we'll do spots.

06:57.726 --> 07:00.267
-Okay. Yeah, I'm down.
-Really? Are you serious?

07:00.351 --> 07:02.059
-Yeah, no, I'm serious.
-I'm fucking serious.

07:02.142 --> 07:03.643
-I'm down to go.
-I could use some
fucking company.

07:03.726 --> 07:05.517
You can drive?
Can you drive?

07:07.309 --> 07:09.351
-Candy is the best.
-It really is.

07:09.434 --> 07:12.100
-It's made by science.
-Yeah, to be fucking
delicious.

07:12.184 --> 07:16.225
Someone with a PhD was like,
"What does the mouth want?"

07:16.309 --> 07:17.809
-(laughs)
-We've got it.

07:17.893 --> 07:20.100
-Pete: Skittles?
You ever have a Skittle?
-Skittles.

07:20.184 --> 07:22.100
The rainbow kingdom.

07:22.184 --> 07:24.225
Pete (laughs):
Yes.

07:24.934 --> 07:26.434
Can I ask why you
got into comedy?

07:26.517 --> 07:29.768
-You seem...
you seem pretty normal.
-(laughs)

07:29.851 --> 07:31.309
-I mean, you know
what I mean.
-Yeah.

07:31.392 --> 07:34.142
-Like, we're-- we're
a bruised people.
-Yeah.

07:34.225 --> 07:36.267
-What happened to you?
-Um...

07:36.351 --> 07:39.559
I feel-- It was just, like,
a result of my surroundings,
kind of?

07:39.643 --> 07:42.100
I grew up in this, like,
low-income, black neighborhood.

07:42.184 --> 07:45.100
I went to this, like,
rich, white school,

07:45.184 --> 07:48.392
and... I just felt, like,
I don't know, growing up,

07:48.476 --> 07:51.559
like, "funny" was
a more stable identity

07:51.643 --> 07:55.726
than whatever I had to do
to, like, go back and forth
between that.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.309
So I just, like, was, like,
"Okay if I'm the funny kid,

07:58.392 --> 08:01.100
then I'm the funny kid
no matter where I am."

08:01.184 --> 08:03.975
'Cause, you know--
And it's also, like,
nobody funny-bashes.

08:04.059 --> 08:05.434
-You know?
-(laughter)

08:05.517 --> 08:07.017
Like, no one is
gonna attack you

08:07.100 --> 08:09.267
for doing bits
in a conversation.

08:09.351 --> 08:11.267
I wish there wasn't
any bashing.

08:11.351 --> 08:14.975
That'd be ideal, but then
I might not be a comedian, so...

08:15.059 --> 08:16.975
Have you ever been
to The Cellar?

08:17.059 --> 08:19.142
Um, no, I've seen,
like, videos of it.

08:19.225 --> 08:21.684
That's where, like, Schumer
goes up with, like, Madonna.

08:21.768 --> 08:23.434
-Yeah. Right?
You never know.
-Right.

08:23.517 --> 08:24.975
You never know
who's gonna go up.

08:25.059 --> 08:27.100
Sometimes it's Schumer,
you might follow Chappelle,

08:27.184 --> 08:28.975
Rock--
it's all the best ones.

08:29.059 --> 08:31.434
Like, even getting
an audition at the Cellar?

08:31.517 --> 08:34.351
I mean, it's huge.
It's a really, really big deal.

08:34.434 --> 08:37.726
-Wow.
-So somebody vouched
for me, I get to go up--

08:37.809 --> 08:40.809
even that, it's like,
it's just an honor
to be nominated.

08:40.893 --> 08:43.017
But if I kill,
