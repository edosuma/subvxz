00:14.298 --> 00:15.280
Fire!

00:16.417 --> 00:17.749
Yeah!

00:27.556 --> 00:29.066
I don't know what's wrong with me.

00:29.166 --> 00:31.049
I'm down and left on every shot.

00:31.049 --> 00:32.598
Here, let me take a look.

00:35.739 --> 00:37.621
Try bending your elbow a little bit.

00:39.027 --> 00:43.078
Maybe slide your hand
back a half inch or so.

01:07.711 --> 01:09.875
No, I can't do this.

01:09.975 --> 01:11.808
You're great at this. Your tongue touched

01:11.810 --> 01:12.811
the hangy thing in the back of my throat.

01:12.911 --> 01:13.460
No, Geils.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.633
I mean, I can't get
close to another partner.

01:15.712 --> 01:17.614
Tribeca, after all we've been through,

01:17.662 --> 01:19.778
you can't tell me you
don't have feelings for me.

01:31.699 --> 01:33.425
I don't have feelings for you.

01:34.254 --> 01:36.971
You're just never gonna let
anyone in the rest of your life?

01:38.549 --> 01:40.099
See you around, partner.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.840
Adios, partner.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.500
Later, Angie.

02:08.008 --> 02:09.995
Hey, why the long face?

02:09.997 --> 02:11.580
I was a forceps baby.

02:11.582 --> 02:13.883
Hey, where's the normal
bartender, regular Pete?

02:13.970 --> 02:15.219
Yeah, he had the night off.

02:15.221 --> 02:16.804
I've never known him to take the night off.

02:16.806 --> 02:18.055
That's why we called him Pete.

02:18.057 --> 02:20.334
Wait, I remember. He died.

02:20.434 --> 02:21.906
Oh, wow, that's sad.

02:21.931 --> 02:23.235
How about a drink?

02:23.237 --> 02:24.653
In honor of regular Pete.

02:24.655 --> 02:26.405
Pete, regular Pete.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.824
Yeah, right, that's what I said.

02:29.693 --> 02:31.577
Drowning your sorrows?

02:32.111 --> 02:34.068
Yeah, I got feelings for my partner,

02:34.092 --> 02:36.209
but she doesn't want to recip...

02:36.211 --> 02:37.543
Hey.

02:37.545 --> 02:40.263
Look, you don't think I want to recip?

02:40.265 --> 02:43.483
Of course, I want to recip,
but you don't understand.

02:43.483 --> 02:45.955
I've had 236 partners,

02:45.979 --> 02:48.583
and I've fallen in love with
every single one of them.

02:48.630 --> 02:49.843
That's so normal.

02:49.843 --> 02:52.539
And something bad has happened
to every single one of them.

02:52.602 --> 02:55.186
So, the odds of something
happening to me are zero.

02:56.338 --> 02:57.489
If I ever lost you...

02:57.491 --> 02:59.456
Nothing's gonna happen to me, kid.

02:59.456 --> 03:00.956
I swear.

03:02.578 --> 03:03.425
Okay.

03:03.427 --> 03:04.726
Let's do this.

03:05.429 --> 03:08.296
I feel like a princess in
an old-fashioned fairy tale.

03:09.549 --> 03:12.617
Wait, let me just go drain the lizard.

03:18.170 --> 03:20.373
Here you go, Geils, on the house.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.399
Thanks.

03:26.650 --> 03:29.150
Hey, how did you know my name?

03:29.152 --> 03:31.236
My name, my name.

03:31.238 --> 03:33.238
My name.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.490
My name, my name.

03:36.741 --> 03:39.449
You better stop spinning.
You're gonna make yourself sick.

03:40.975 --> 03:43.916
Thanks. Hey, how did you know my...

03:44.835 --> 03:46.751
It was the smoking drink.

03:49.763 --> 03:52.445
All right, Geils, get ready for some...

04:09.361 --> 04:10.639
Something's happened to Geils. I know it.

04:10.639 --> 04:13.692
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

04:13.740 --> 04:14.775
Somebody order a body bag?

04:14.775 --> 04:16.442
No, no, no, no, no.

04:16.973 --> 04:20.757
Maybe Geils just went home
to sleep off his hangover.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.476
He would never just leave like that.

04:22.478 --> 04:23.978
I'm gonna try his phone again.

04:25.982 --> 04:27.231
Geils' phone.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.682
Hey, it's Tribeca. Have you seen him?

04:28.684 --> 04:31.106
No, no word since last time
you called five minutes ago.

04:31.184 --> 04:32.684
All right, I'm sorry. I'm just worried.

04:32.709 --> 04:34.825
It's okay.

04:35.572 --> 04:37.489
Oh, my big phone's ringing.

04:37.491 --> 04:38.655
Tribeca.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.633
Hello, Detective Tribeca.

04:40.688 --> 04:41.834
I have a friend of yours

04:41.834 --> 04:43.351
that would very much like to see you again.

04:43.430 --> 04:44.854
He's got Geils.

04:44.854 --> 04:46.854
Trace this call. Trace this call.

04:47.573 --> 04:48.478
Who is this?

04:48.511 --> 04:49.811
I don't want to use my real name.

04:49.813 --> 04:51.871
Just call me Wilson Phillips.

04:51.966 --> 04:53.961
Wait, no, that is my real name.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.929
Just call me Wilson P.

04:56.977 --> 04:59.298
You listen to me, Wilson P.

04:59.298 --> 05:01.582
If you touch a hair on my partner's head...

05:01.582 --> 05:03.489
No, no, no, you listen to me, Detective!

05:03.589 --> 05:05.357
If I do not get $1,000

05:05.382 --> 05:07.966
in non-sequential coffee
gift cards in 2 hours,

05:07.967 --> 05:10.017
the bomb strapped to
your partner will explode.

05:10.401 --> 05:12.073
How we doing on this trace?

05:12.638 --> 05:14.221
Keep talking?

05:14.594 --> 05:17.678
So, uh, Wilson P., what do you like to do

05:17.680 --> 05:19.550
when you're not kidnapping people?

05:21.714 --> 05:22.929
Nice try.

05:22.931 --> 05:25.493
I love sports, especially
stuff in the water.

05:25.548 --> 05:27.351
- Snorkel, paddle board.
- Do we have it?

05:27.353 --> 05:29.469
Sometimes I just lay on the beach,

05:29.471 --> 05:31.032
let the birds eat the
bread off my naked body.

05:31.032 --> 05:32.164
That's really interesting.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.130
Tell me more.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.846
Time's up, Detective!

05:34.848 --> 05:36.464
Is what I will say in two hours

05:36.466 --> 05:38.373
if you do not get me what I want.

05:38.473 --> 05:39.588
Goodbye.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.307
And god bless.

05:41.309 --> 05:43.259
How did we do on the trace?

05:43.695 --> 05:45.493
- Huh?
- Did we get the trace?

05:45.493 --> 05:47.109
You wanted me to trace a call?

05:47.111 --> 05:48.744
Oh! Girl, I was jamming.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.052
There are over 15 Wilson Phillipses

05:55.052 --> 05:56.170
in the state of California.

05:56.170 --> 05:57.331
We have cops tracking them,

05:57.331 --> 05:58.864
but we'll never get to
all of them in two hours.

05:58.866 --> 06:00.032
Well, luckily, every call

06:00.034 --> 06:01.533
that comes into the precinct is recorded.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.869
Did you and Edelweiss get
anything from the call?

06:03.871 --> 06:06.371
Unfortunately, Dr. Edelweiss
is at a forensics conference

06:06.373 --> 06:09.124
in Istanbul, but I was
able to reach him on Skype.

06:10.844 --> 06:13.037
Hello, Dr. Edelweiss.

06:15.516 --> 06:16.939
Dr. Edelweiss?

06:20.269 --> 06:21.969
There's a bit of a time delay.

06:26.802 --> 06:28.364
Let's just get started.

06:28.673 --> 06:31.123
Listen to the audio from the phone call.

06:31.306 --> 06:32.806
If I do not get $1,000

06:32.808 --> 06:35.416
in non-sequential coffee
gift cards in two hours,

06:35.791 --> 06:37.722
the bomb strapped to
your partner will explode.

06:37.722 --> 06:38.506
That's him.

06:38.506 --> 06:41.057
That's what I thought,
too, but there's more.

06:41.059 --> 06:42.591
Watch what happens when we...

06:42.593 --> 06:45.061
Ah, there you are, Tribeca. How are you?

06:45.063 --> 06:46.562
It's been a tough day, but you know,

06:46.564 --> 06:48.314
just trying to stay optimistic.

06:57.608 --> 07:01.243
Watch what happens when I
strip out Wilson P.'s voice.

07:04.115 --> 07:07.166
Then I take out any other voices.

07:07.168 --> 07:09.118
Which leads...

07:09.120 --> 07:12.705
Yes, I was very concerned
when I heard about Geils,

07:12.707 --> 07:13.873
but don't worry.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.274
This technology is absolutely amazing.

07:15.274 --> 07:17.274
I mean, here I am in the...

07:23.061 --> 07:26.178
So, if we take out everything
but the background noise...

07:27.703 --> 07:28.804
Wait a second.

07:29.130 --> 07:31.075
The guy asked for coffee gift cards,

07:31.075 --> 07:32.575
which must mean he likes...

07:32.577 --> 07:34.581
- Overpriced coffee. -
Shitty, last-minute gifts.

07:34.675 --> 07:37.343
That's someone steaming
milk. That's in a coffee shop.

07:37.345 --> 07:39.011
There's thousands in the city.

07:39.013 --> 07:40.763
We'll just never narrow it down in time.

07:41.047 --> 07:43.847
Hang on, maybe I can pull up
some of the background noises.

07:43.849 --> 07:48.302
I have to say, Coffee
Commune at 1287 Beverly Drive

07:48.304 --> 07:49.890
is my favorite coffee shop in town.

07:50.195 --> 07:51.684
That's right around the corner.

07:51.684 --> 07:53.301
We're there every day.

07:53.303 --> 07:55.352
He knows us.

07:59.925 --> 08:03.121
Istanbul, and it's as if I'm
standing right next to you.

08:03.146 --> 08:05.313
So, Scholls, what are we looking at?

08:14.612 --> 08:16.380
What can I get you? A Cuvanista?

08:16.480 --> 08:18.113
Squat Wipe? Double Dark?

08:18.115 --> 08:20.365
I'm Detective Tanner.
This is Detective Hoffman.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.783
We need to ask you a few questions.

08:21.785 --> 08:23.568
Seriously, man? This is my busiest time.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.620
At least order something.
I got a whole line here.

08:25.622 --> 08:27.622
Fine, just a coffee.

08:27.624 --> 08:28.674
I don't know what that is.

08:28.773 --> 08:30.599
Come on, an Italian Long?

08:30.699 --> 08:33.482
A Perky Pony? A Kansas City Mudstorm?

08:34.620 --> 08:35.952
Coming right up.

08:36.577 --> 08:38.821
We're trying to track
down one of your customers.

08:38.823 --> 08:40.240
You recognize this voice?

08:40.241 --> 08:41.991
If I do not get $1,000

08:41.993 --> 08:45.377
in non-sequential coffee
gift cards in two hours...

08:45.380 --> 08:47.414
Yeah, I remember him.

08:47.416 --> 08:49.332
Nice guy, good tipper.

08:49.334 --> 08:52.469
Hint, hint. Are we done here?

08:52.471 --> 08:54.940
A cop's life is at stake here!

08:55.160 --> 08:57.741
Now, before I tape your
mouth to that milk steamer...

08:57.741 --> 08:59.191
Go on.

08:59.192 --> 09:01.692
What else you know about this guy?

09:01.694 --> 09:02.743
I don't know.

09:02.745 --> 09:05.397
He's 6'2", thin, light blond hair.

09:05.468 --> 09:06.111
Think!

09:06.210 --> 09:08.900
I've got this mug he used yesterday

09:08.925 --> 09:10.053
with his fingerprints on it!

09:10.053 --> 09:11.586
I am losing patience.

09:11.587 --> 09:13.420
I-I-i think he left his
driver's license here.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.172
You want me to go check the lost and found?

09:15.174 --> 09:17.641
You are stepping on my last nerve.

09:17.643 --> 09:20.177
I don't know. He... He... he rides a bike?

09:20.553 --> 09:22.491
Lives within biking distance.

09:23.682 --> 09:25.482
We're done here.

09:25.687 --> 09:27.303
Well, he comes in every day at 11:00.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.490
If you wait like six more minutes...

09:28.490 --> 09:30.657
I'd quit while you're ahead.

09:37.612 --> 09:39.729
All right, we found five Wilson Phillipses

09:39.731 --> 09:41.270
within biking distance of the coffee shop,

09:41.270 --> 09:42.570
and we're getting search
warrants for each one,

09:42.572 --> 09:44.071
but we need to buy a little time.

09:44.073 --> 09:46.741
So, maybe we hold a press conference,

09:46.859 --> 09:48.129
try and draw the guy out.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.845
Good thinking.

09:49.847 --> 09:53.132
Tribeca, I know you and Geils were tight.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.300
We are gonna find him...

09:54.303 --> 09:55.885
Bup, bup, bup, bup, bup!

09:55.886 --> 09:58.020
It's not just that. The
way we left things was...

09:58.022 --> 09:59.138
- Was it?
- Kind of.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.639
I see. You know, sometimes...

10:00.641 --> 10:02.191
I know, but it's hard because...

10:02.193 --> 10:03.285
I get it. I've been there.

10:03.285 --> 10:04.375
Thanks, Lieutenant, you
always know what to...

10:04.475 --> 10:04.900
I do.

10:05.996 --> 10:08.964
God. Geils could be hanging
on by a thread, or, worse,

10:08.964 --> 10:11.215
he could be in the early
stages of Stockholm Syndrome.

10:11.217 --> 10:11.957
Even worse than that,

10:11.957 --> 10:13.574
he could be developing
a bond with his captor.

10:14.827 --> 10:17.261
Honey! Muffins are ready!

10:21.621 --> 10:23.421
I made you some low-sodium muffins

10:23.423 --> 10:25.437
because I know your blood
pressure's an issue right now.

10:25.437 --> 10:26.936
Maybe later.

10:26.938 --> 10:29.522
Okay, maybe later.

10:31.943 --> 10:33.526
What'd you do that for?

10:33.528 --> 10:35.829
I don't know. Maybe I'll tell you later.

10:35.831 --> 10:37.497
Can we not do this right now?

10:37.499 --> 10:38.948
I'm trying to run a kidnapping.

10:38.950 --> 10:41.785
You always do this. You
take on everything yourself.

10:41.787 --> 10:43.787
I got to go out.

10:43.789 --> 10:45.755
Oh, great, your answer to everything.

10:45.757 --> 10:47.874
You know what? I hope this bomb explodes.

10:47.876 --> 10:50.009
Don't even joke about that.

10:50.011 --> 10:52.295
Okay, I'm sorry.

10:53.965 --> 10:56.216
I'm sorry, too.

10:56.218 --> 10:57.801
Hey, is that Tribeca on TV?

10:57.803 --> 10:59.654
We are working very hard.

10:59.631 --> 11:01.268
We are tracking every lead,

11:01.268 --> 11:03.993
and we are confident that
we will find Detective Geils

11:04.142 --> 11:07.143
and bring this kidnapper to justice.

11:07.145 --> 11:09.312
At this point, I'll take some questions.

11:10.482 --> 11:11.864
Yes?

11:11.866 --> 11:13.533
Where should I take the in-laws to dinner?

11:13.535 --> 11:16.486
Everyone likes Italian. Yes?

11:16.488 --> 11:17.620
Who are you wearing?

11:17.622 --> 11:19.789
"Lady Cop" by Valentino.

11:19.791 --> 11:22.742
Former Cabinet Member
Stephen Chu won a Nobel prize

11:22.744 --> 11:25.411
for capturing atoms with these light beams.

11:25.413 --> 11:27.296
What are lasers?

11:28.101 --> 11:30.466
And here's my message to the kidnapper.

11:30.468 --> 11:34.403
You think you're pretty
slick kidnapping my partner.

11:34.405 --> 11:35.638
Thanks, I do.

11:35.640 --> 11:36.756
I'm not finished.

11:36.758 --> 11:38.025
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.123
You messed with the wrong cop.

11:40.436 --> 11:42.602
And, Geils, if you're listening,

11:42.604 --> 11:44.272
just know that I will not rest.

11:44.297 --> 11:44.993
I know, Angie.

11:44.993 --> 11:46.576
Will somebody just let me finish?

11:46.578 --> 11:48.028
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

11:48.030 --> 11:49.246
Until I find you.

11:49.248 --> 11:50.530
I guess I was pretty much done.

11:50.532 --> 11:51.865
No further questions.

11:53.423 --> 11:55.357
We got the address. Let's bounce.

11:58.099 --> 12:00.008
All right, take him down!

12:00.149 --> 12:02.024
Try not to let Geils explode.

12:04.233 --> 12:05.733
What the hell?

12:06.529 --> 12:08.062
Look at that rack.

12:08.064 --> 12:10.281
Charlie, don't.

12:10.283 --> 12:11.365
It's a booby trap!

12:22.487 --> 12:24.506
He died doing what he loved.

12:37.234 --> 12:38.150
Hello?

12:38.152 --> 12:39.439
Nice try, Detective.

12:39.439 --> 12:40.939
How stupid do you think I am?

12:40.942 --> 12:43.162
Do you really think I
would be at my home address?

12:43.162 --> 12:44.294
Why are you doing this?

12:44.295 --> 12:45.578
Geils never hurt anybody.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.785
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I wasting your time?

12:47.855 --> 12:50.202
Am I threatening to take
away something you care about?

12:50.202 --> 12:51.918
Well, now you know how it feels.

12:51.921 --> 12:55.123
Two weeks ago, Coffee Commune.

13:02.914 --> 13:04.090
Hey, can I get a small...

13:04.090 --> 13:06.374
Sir, we're gonna need you to
step aside. Police business.

13:06.376 --> 13:08.031
Sure, I... I... I'm
kind of in a hurry, so...

13:08.031 --> 13:09.314
Yeah, we'll be quick.

13:10.805 --> 13:13.796
Okay. Kind of a large order here.

13:13.896 --> 13:15.572
Let me get 37 cappuccinos,

13:15.572 --> 13:18.607
20 whole milk, 11 nonfat, 2 with...

13:18.610 --> 13:20.359
What is that, armin mist?

13:20.361 --> 13:22.828
Armin mist? Almond milk.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.747
Almond milk? That's a... oh, my god,

13:24.749 --> 13:26.415
your handwriting is terrible.

13:26.417 --> 13:27.533
What's this abomination?

13:27.535 --> 13:28.868
Crab cake.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.670
Cr... I can't even read that.

13:30.672 --> 13:32.088
Croissant, it's croissant.

13:32.090 --> 13:34.340
It's croissant. Looks like cummerbund.

13:34.342 --> 13:36.008
I'm really in a hurry, guys.

13:36.010 --> 13:37.710
Swear to god, we're almost done.

13:37.712 --> 13:39.879
The detective here would
like two cummerbunds.

13:39.881 --> 13:41.714
Would you like a top hat with
that, maybe some cufflinks?

13:41.716 --> 13:44.550
I get it, I get it. My
handwriting is terrible.

13:44.552 --> 13:45.142
Terrible?

13:45.142 --> 13:46.918
It looks like you wrote
it on a roller coaster.

13:46.943 --> 13:48.359
Okay, all I want is a small...

13:48.361 --> 13:49.382
Don't worry, sir.

13:49.382 --> 13:51.625
We'll get you to your
gym class on time, okay?

13:53.530 --> 13:55.730
Hey, while we're here,
what's the origin of coffee?

13:55.732 --> 13:57.365
I've always wanted to know...

13:57.367 --> 13:59.515
You really hit the nail on the
head with that one, Tribeca,

13:59.609 --> 14:02.309
except I wasn't a gym teacher yet.

14:02.311 --> 14:05.196
I was on my way to a
gym-teacher job interview.

14:05.196 --> 14:06.979
Getting the picture?

14:08.366 --> 14:11.784
But I missed it because of
you and your stupid coffees

14:11.786 --> 14:13.569
and your stupid handwriting.

14:13.571 --> 14:15.321
My life is ruined.

14:15.323 --> 14:16.739
My wife left me.

14:16.741 --> 14:18.735
My kids ran away and
married each other, so now,

14:18.735 --> 14:20.702
I'm taking away your boyfriend.

14:21.616 --> 14:24.909
We're not together. We'll
never be together, okay?

14:27.421 --> 14:28.614
He's just my partner, that's it.

14:28.614 --> 14:30.281
Look, we'll make amends when we need to,

14:30.282 --> 14:31.948
but you need to let Geils go.

14:31.950 --> 14:36.369
I will forget everything if you
just give me a simple apology.

14:36.371 --> 14:38.838
Never. You're insane.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.123
I'm gonna find you...

14:40.125 --> 14:41.191
You will never find me!

14:41.191 --> 14:42.774
I'm a trained gym teacher.

14:42.776 --> 14:44.692
Do you know how many sweatsuits
there are in the world?

14:44.694 --> 14:46.361
Every time you walk down the street,

14:46.363 --> 14:47.745
and you see someone in a sweatsuit,

14:47.747 --> 14:49.614
you'll wonder, "Hey, is that him?"

14:49.616 --> 14:51.032
Is that him?"

14:51.034 --> 14:52.116
Is that him?

14:52.118 --> 14:53.835
Got to go.

14:55.799 --> 14:57.815
Lieutenant, we found Geils.

14:57.815 --> 15:00.732
Send in everybody!

15:10.227 --> 15:11.693
Go, go!

15:11.695 --> 15:12.861
Cover the back!

15:34.718 --> 15:36.802
Go, go, go, go, go!

15:37.182 --> 15:38.643
Wilson Phillips!

15:38.643 --> 15:40.226
We have you surrounded.

15:40.228 --> 15:43.479
Come out of the house with your hands up,

15:43.481 --> 15:46.065
and do not blow up Detective Geils!

15:46.067 --> 15:47.483
All right, everybody, look alive.

15:47.485 --> 15:48.818
He's a gym teacher.

15:48.820 --> 15:51.145
We have no idea what he's capable of.

15:51.145 --> 15:54.096
Ohh. Damn it! I'm out.

15:54.099 --> 15:55.398
Tribeca, take over.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.351
Ohh!

15:58.353 --> 16:01.855
Listen, Phillips, we know you're hurting,

16:01.857 --> 16:04.991
but that's no reason to take
it out on poor Jay Geils.

16:04.993 --> 16:08.194
Sure, he may not be the
sharpest tool in the shed,

16:08.196 --> 16:09.446
his apartment's a dump,

16:09.448 --> 16:11.615
and he's the worst driver of all time.

16:11.617 --> 16:13.617
Have you ever seen a 9-point turn?

16:13.619 --> 16:14.701
I have.

16:16.951 --> 16:20.035
Come to think of it, I have no good reason

16:20.037 --> 16:21.787
to have feelings for him,

16:21.789 --> 16:24.156
but damn it...

16:28.295 --> 16:31.296
I love him.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.363
Tribeca!

16:34.363 --> 16:35.529
Geils!

16:35.531 --> 16:37.364
Wilson, you got to turn yourself in.

16:37.366 --> 16:39.416
I am not going to prison.

16:39.418 --> 16:41.919
You know what prisons have? Gyms.

16:41.921 --> 16:45.539
And every great gym teacher
has spent time in prison.

16:49.545 --> 16:51.428
I'm coming out!

16:51.430 --> 16:53.096
Okay, remember, he's the only one

16:53.098 --> 16:54.578
who knows how to disarm the bomb,

16:54.578 --> 16:56.695
so whatever you do, hold your fire.

16:56.697 --> 16:58.513
Okay?

16:58.515 --> 16:59.681
Hey.

17:03.749 --> 17:05.688
Sorry, Mr. Wilson.

17:05.688 --> 17:07.070
Oh, my god, the bomb.

17:07.073 --> 17:08.489
Geils, how much time left?

17:08.491 --> 17:10.441
1 minute left!

17:10.443 --> 17:13.327
Everybody get out of here. Save yourself.

17:13.329 --> 17:14.528
No can do.

17:14.530 --> 17:16.997
Tanner, send in the robot.

18:21.909 --> 18:25.195
Damn! Sorry. It ran out of juice.

18:25.195 --> 18:27.529
Anybody got 12 "C" batteries on 'em?

18:28.363 --> 18:29.819
Geils, I'm coming.

18:31.021 --> 18:33.722
Tribeca, what the hell are you doing?!

18:35.297 --> 18:36.880
Wait a minute, am I back in?

18:38.563 --> 18:40.335
You shouldn't be in here.
This bomb's gonna go off.

18:40.335 --> 18:41.329
Save yourself.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.726
Save myself for what? Another partner?

18:43.727 --> 18:45.277
I don't want a new partner.

18:45.278 --> 18:47.862
It's you and me for the long haul, Geils.

18:47.864 --> 18:49.780
I mean, sure, things could change.

18:49.782 --> 18:50.981
Our jobs are dangerous,

18:50.983 --> 18:52.950
but I just want to let my guard down

18:52.952 --> 18:54.285
and be vulnerable

18:54.287 --> 18:56.370
and spend time with
someone I really care about.

18:56.372 --> 18:58.706
You know, I've been thinking
a lot lately about life,

18:58.708 --> 18:59.874
and it's really short.

18:59.876 --> 19:00.230
I just really want to...

19:00.230 --> 19:01.530
Tribeca, 42 seconds.

19:01.532 --> 19:02.781
Right, right, okay.

19:02.783 --> 19:05.116
Here goes nothing.

19:13.557 --> 19:15.891
All right, let's see what we got here.

19:31.882 --> 19:34.048
Hello, you have reached tech support

19:34.050 --> 19:35.767
for the all-American bomb company.

19:35.769 --> 19:37.954
There are six bombs ahead of you.

19:38.017 --> 19:41.062
Your bomb is important to
us. Please stay on the...

19:42.500 --> 19:43.916
Okay, I'm just gonna
shut my eyes and cut one.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.601
Yeah, wait, what? Maybe
we keep brainstorming.

19:48.669 --> 19:50.013
Geils?

19:50.892 --> 19:52.558
I do, too.

19:54.710 --> 19:55.593
5 seconds.

20:28.326 --> 20:29.346
4 seconds.
