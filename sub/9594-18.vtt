WEBVTT

00:23.324 --> 00:26.094
Do you mind hurrying up
in there?

00:27.828 --> 00:31.765
Seriously, what is
taking so long?
Did you fall in?

00:31.799 --> 00:34.034
I need to go.
Come on, come on,
come on!

00:35.436 --> 00:37.271
Yo Rob, what's up?

00:37.305 --> 00:39.373
Oh! Doing the pee-pee
dance, bro?

00:39.407 --> 00:41.709
Nice, I love that dance.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.346
Doing the pee

00:45.379 --> 00:47.148
I invented the pee-pee dance.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.682
Oh, yeah!

00:48.716 --> 00:52.486
Oh! I too wish to participate
in the dance of the pee-pee.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.788
But I do not know how!

00:54.822 --> 00:57.325
It's quite simple, girl.
I'll show you.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.861
* Step to the left,
now, step to the right

01:00.894 --> 01:02.730
* Put your knees together
and squeeze 'em tight

01:02.763 --> 01:04.598
* Keep your arms
moving side to side

01:04.632 --> 01:06.667
* Try to hold it in
till it's time to ride

01:06.700 --> 01:09.103
* Knock, knock
Let me in
Knock, knock

01:09.137 --> 01:11.505
* Let me in,
I gotta go, uh
Knock, knock

01:11.539 --> 01:13.174
* Let me in
Knock, knock

01:13.207 --> 01:14.608
* Let me in
I gotta go

01:14.642 --> 01:16.444
* Keep moving now
Don't you stop

01:16.477 --> 01:18.412
* Hold it in till
it's time to drop

01:18.446 --> 01:20.314
* Let me in
before I pop

01:20.348 --> 01:22.116
* Too late
Gotta grab the mop

01:22.150 --> 01:24.352
* Knock, knock
Let me in
Knock, knock

01:24.385 --> 01:26.720
* Let me in,
I gotta go, uh
Knock, knock

01:26.754 --> 01:30.191
* Let me in, knock, knock
Let me in, I gotta go *

01:30.224 --> 01:33.627
-Aw! Don't tell me I missed
the pee-pee dance.

01:38.566 --> 01:42.336
Titans, it's time we had
a bathroom meeting.

01:42.370 --> 01:43.771
A bathroom meeting?

01:43.804 --> 01:47.708
Yes, you guys are spending
way too much time in there.

01:47.741 --> 01:51.345
As Titans, we spend on
average three percent of
our time fighting crime,

01:51.379 --> 01:54.882
seven percent dancing,
18 percent doing food
related activities

01:54.915 --> 01:58.552
and the rest of the
Titans' time is spent
in the bathroom.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.920
This cannot go on.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.856
Ah, can you repeat all
that stuff you just said?

02:02.890 --> 02:03.757
I was in the bathroom.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.795
As of this moment,
I'm instituting
bathroom rationing.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.398
No lavatory visit will
last more than

02:11.265 --> 02:12.933
five minutes.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.503
You can't do that to us.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.206
That time frame
will not be sufficient.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.475
There's so much stuff we need
to do in there, bro!

02:21.509 --> 02:24.178
And, what exactly is that?

02:24.212 --> 02:25.446
It's where I tap dance.

02:27.348 --> 02:28.882
CYBORG:
It's where I go to sing.

02:32.453 --> 02:36.524
BEAST BOY: It's where I do my
steam painting, the most
temporary of art forms.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.559
Perfection!

02:39.427 --> 02:40.794
Aw!

02:40.828 --> 02:43.664
STARFIRE:
It is where I create my
favorite recipes.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.967
This will be the most
delicious pot of
the chili.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.604
That is not what
the bathroom is for.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.506
It is a place of
serious business.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.343
In and out.
Nothing in there should
take more than five minutes.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.912
Ten second hand-washes,
one minute showers,
four minute shaves.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.315
It takes you four minutes,
to shave what?

03:01.349 --> 03:02.683
I have very thick facial hair.

03:02.716 --> 03:06.720
Oh, yes.
This is coming in very nicely.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.358
That, my friend,
is a moustache.

03:10.391 --> 03:14.395
Don't you understand?
The bathroom is a
special place for us.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.564
It's a place of magic.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.699
Magic? Pfft. Please.

03:18.732 --> 03:19.933
It is true, Robin.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.670
Humankind did not advance
into the modern age

03:22.703 --> 03:24.972
until they encountered
the first bathroom.

03:25.005 --> 03:28.276
Where it came from,
nobody knows.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.478
I do.
We built them,
with pipes and tile.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.946
And, just to prove
everything you can possibly
do in a bathroom

03:32.980 --> 03:35.449
can be accomplished
in under five minutes...

03:35.483 --> 03:36.617
Observe!

04:04.578 --> 04:06.447
See, five minutes.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.881
Why did the bathroom explode?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.683
Well, that's what happens
when the timer hits zero.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.585
What, you've never seen a
timer hit zero, before?

04:11.619 --> 04:13.387
The whole room is on the fire.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.789
Yes, it is.
Now, that I've demonstrated
what's possible,

04:15.823 --> 04:18.826
I'll be holding you all
to the same standard.

04:18.859 --> 04:22.496
-Remember, five minutes.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.532
I will be watching.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.577
-Done.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.575
It's bubble time, baby.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.958
Titans, great news!

05:24.992 --> 05:27.561
Bathroom usage is down
90 percent.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.433
What has happened?
Your hygiene!

05:32.466 --> 05:35.102
Your five minute standard
killed the magic for us.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.838
We don't even bother to go
into the bathroom now.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.707
I haven't tap danced in weeks.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.475
You can tap dance anywhere.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.712
The bathroom is where you
go to wash your filthy bodies,
and do other unspeakable acts.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.448
Titans, go.
Clean yourselves up.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.482
I mean, come on.

05:51.151 --> 05:54.121
I don't understand
what makes the bathroom
so special for you guys.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.924
Then, please come with us,
Robin.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.960
And we'll show you the magic.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.764
Fine, if it'll restore
your strawberry scent.

06:05.966 --> 06:09.403
All right.
Show me why you need more than
five minutes in the bathroom.

06:09.437 --> 06:12.706
We will, bro.
But first, take this
microphone.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.874
That's a toothbrush.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.776
You have so much to learn.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.113
* If you want to sing

06:20.147 --> 06:22.816
* Sing on, sing on,
sing everything

06:22.850 --> 06:25.185
* If you want to dream

06:25.218 --> 06:29.690
* Dream of, dream of,
everything you are *

07:00.220 --> 07:02.055
Ah! So good.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.593
Guys, you were right.
This place is
absolutely magical.

07:05.626 --> 07:08.161
The five minutes standard
is hereby abolished.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.231
Ya! Booyacity!

07:11.264 --> 07:13.066
-Hurray! Hurray!

07:13.100 --> 07:16.970
If you don't mind,
I'd like a moment alone
with the bathroom.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.172
We understand.
Take your time.

07:22.876 --> 07:26.814
Oh! Those water burritos
are not sitting right.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.817
-Robin's been in there
all morning.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.885
ROBIN: Correction.
I never left.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.788
Dude, what are you doing
in there?

07:34.822 --> 07:36.524
Just enjoying the magic.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.161
Whoo-hoo! Yipee!

07:41.194 --> 07:42.730
Ha, ha, ha!

07:45.198 --> 07:47.200
We never stayed in there,
this long.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.203
Robin is abusing
the bathroom magic.

07:50.237 --> 07:52.506
I want some magic too.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.541
I say we go in.

07:58.846 --> 08:02.215
Sorry. But, this bathroom
is occupied.

08:02.249 --> 08:06.119
Robin, one way or another,
we're getting you out of here.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.588
Never.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.667
If you want this bathroom,
you'll have to
take it from me.

08:19.700 --> 08:20.868
VOICE: Enough!

08:21.635 --> 08:23.003
Who said that?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.905
It is I, Bathroom.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.943
You may call me John.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.650
As you have always sensed,

08:36.684 --> 08:41.755
I and all of the bathrooms
come from a place
of magic, you see.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.557
Where's that, John?

08:43.591 --> 08:47.194
We are survivors of
a distant world,
destroyed long ago.

08:47.227 --> 08:50.097
We thought we had found
a home here, you see.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.901
A world that appreciated us
as much as we did it.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.803
But, you ruined it all.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.037
Sorry, John.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.039
Stuff your sorrys
in a sack.

09:00.373 --> 09:05.012
You have turned a place
of magical fun into
one of strife.

09:05.045 --> 09:09.917
Now I, and all my kind shall
leave this world, forever.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.260
Magical.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.211
Where are they going?

09:38.245 --> 09:41.715
They're going home,
Beast Boy.
They're going home.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.852
I believe John said
their home was destroyed.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.153
Then, I don't know.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.177
So, what do we do now?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.979
Yeah.
I mean, I really gotta go.
