00:01.540 --> 00:04.080
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:04.080 --> 00:05.880
What can I do
to get you to trust me?

00:05.880 --> 00:07.670
Tegan,
I don't miss you.

00:09.580 --> 00:11.710
Need some help?

00:11.710 --> 00:14.040
I'm scared she's gonna
hang herself, like Dad.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.290
We're gonna fix this,
okay?

00:15.290 --> 00:16.920
FBI has an informant.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.500
Someone in your group.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.080
Annalise knows
where Laurel is, Frank.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.500
What's
the account balance?

00:21.500 --> 00:23.710
Man: Your current balance
is $2.17.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.120
Solomon?
Yeah.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.540
It's time to pay up.

00:27.540 --> 00:28.540
I want a father.

00:28.540 --> 00:30.210
You were right.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.620
I represent a suspect
in this case.

00:34.620 --> 00:36.080
Is the body still there?

00:50.750 --> 00:53.250
Oh, come on. We're gonna be
late for class!

00:53.250 --> 00:54.880
So what?

00:54.880 --> 00:58.460
I have to put class before ass
if I'm gonna graduate.

00:58.460 --> 00:59.620
Ahh...

00:59.620 --> 01:01.500
Get out. Get out.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.750
Fine.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.460
Mm. Thank you.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.380
What are you doing?

01:21.790 --> 01:23.880
Annalise texted you.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.670
What does she want?

01:28.670 --> 01:31.170
Hell if I know.

01:31.170 --> 01:32.960
She uses information
as power.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.380
Like that woman needs
any more power.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.210
Preach.

01:43.290 --> 01:44.960
Why, hello.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.750
So, what's this about?

01:47.750 --> 01:49.620
Solomon.

01:49.620 --> 01:51.000
Who told you?

01:51.000 --> 01:52.710
Your boyfriend.
And before you get mad --

01:52.710 --> 01:53.920
I'm mad
at the both of you.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.750
Solomon:
But mostly me.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.170
So, who is
this boyfriend?

02:01.580 --> 02:02.830
What is this?

02:02.830 --> 02:04.460
You two are so close,
you're having sleepovers?

02:04.460 --> 02:05.540
He just got here.

02:05.540 --> 02:06.710
He popped out
of your bedroom!

02:06.710 --> 02:07.790
The kitchen.

02:07.790 --> 02:09.330
And I only asked
for Annalise's help

02:09.330 --> 02:10.670
because you wouldn't
call me back.

02:10.670 --> 02:12.290
You mean because
you didn't have the balls

02:12.290 --> 02:13.170
to come
and talk to me alone.

02:13.170 --> 02:14.620
I told you
she would think that.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.580
I just want to do
whatever I can to fix us.

02:16.580 --> 02:18.330
Why?
Because
you're my daughter.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.000
I mean, why do you want
to fix us right now?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.170
Versus 30 years ago?

02:22.170 --> 02:24.120
What, you're scared I'm gonna
out you as a deadbeat dad?

02:24.120 --> 02:25.170
Ruin your brand?

02:25.170 --> 02:26.880
I'm scared
that I will die

02:26.880 --> 02:28.790
without ever getting
to know you, Michaela.

02:28.790 --> 02:30.830
That's why I'm here,
why I involved Annalise.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.210
I want to be
in your life.

02:35.920 --> 02:36.920
He write you
a blank check, too?

02:36.920 --> 02:38.120
What?

02:38.120 --> 02:39.290
Oh, he didn't tell you
about that?

02:39.290 --> 02:40.380
Tell me
you didn't do that.

02:40.380 --> 02:41.710
You asked for that money,
Michaela.

02:41.710 --> 02:43.120
She was testing you.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.500
Just tell me
what you want --

02:44.500 --> 02:46.670
even if that means
that I should go away forever.

02:46.670 --> 02:49.830
But I will do
whatever you tell me to do.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.710
What I want is for you
to have been there for me

02:51.710 --> 02:53.330
every time
Trishelle reminded me

02:53.330 --> 02:55.460
that I was nothing more
than a welfare check.

02:55.460 --> 02:56.750
Or to beat the hell
out of the parents

02:56.750 --> 02:59.580
whose kids called me the N-word
on the playground.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.120
Or to stop my teachers
from putting me in special ed

03:02.120 --> 03:05.080
because I was so scared living
in racist-ass Monroe County

03:05.080 --> 03:07.460
that I never spoke
in class!

03:11.000 --> 03:14.040
I-I hate myself for even
letting that happen to you.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.620
Well, I hate you, too.

03:16.750 --> 03:18.460
And you.

03:18.460 --> 03:20.170
But mostly you.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.170
Wait, he was in Annalise's
that early in the morning?

03:40.170 --> 03:41.420
Maybe they were
smashing.

03:41.420 --> 03:43.040
Stop before I vomit.

03:44.380 --> 03:46.080
You know we have class
in an hour.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.880
So, I'll be drunk
in class.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.620
Well, at least you know
Solomon really cares about you.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.500
Mnh. He only cares
about his reputation.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.040
Alright, so, then,
let's cash the check

03:53.040 --> 03:54.330
and move to South America.

03:54.330 --> 03:56.040
He's the one that needs
to disappear, not me.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.380
Then take the money
and hire a P.I.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.040
and figure out
why Annalise picked me.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.290
Man, you really are
a dog with a bone.

04:00.290 --> 04:01.380
Yeah, a big bone.

04:01.380 --> 04:02.880
You know
how infuriating it is

04:02.880 --> 04:04.670
that Annalise knows something
about me that I don't?

04:04.670 --> 04:05.830
Welcome to the club.

04:05.830 --> 04:07.670
Drink.

04:07.670 --> 04:09.170
Weird.

04:09.170 --> 04:10.170
Who is it?

04:12.250 --> 04:14.210
Alright, you can take
two more at noon.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.920
Call me
if you need anything.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.460
I can leave work anytime.

04:18.460 --> 04:20.170
Good.

04:20.170 --> 04:21.920
I was thinking
a sponge bath later.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.540
You know, I actually hired
someone else for that.

04:23.540 --> 04:24.460
Who?

04:24.460 --> 04:26.040
Oliver:
Hello? Bonnie?

04:26.040 --> 04:27.330
We're in here!

04:28.380 --> 04:29.960
Oh, my God.
You look --

04:29.960 --> 04:31.750
Handsome as hell?

04:31.750 --> 04:33.330
Sure.

04:33.330 --> 04:35.620
Leave his side at any point,
and I'll know.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.540
Just call me
Florence Nightin-glue.

04:37.540 --> 04:38.710
Behave.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.210
Oliver?

04:41.210 --> 04:43.080
Frank really wants
a sponge bath.

04:44.670 --> 04:47.040
First, let's see how you do
fluffing my pillow.

04:51.420 --> 04:52.960
Chloe: Yas, queen!

04:52.960 --> 04:55.120
Go, queen!

04:55.120 --> 04:56.580
Now do
the treble step.

04:56.580 --> 04:57.830
Mom, look.
Remember this part?

04:57.830 --> 04:59.830
Of course.

04:59.830 --> 05:02.380
That's not all the wee
leprechaun has left in him.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.620
Oh, God!

05:05.620 --> 05:06.620
My back! Oh.

05:07.830 --> 05:09.380
Oh, I think I might have
outgrown that move.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.670
I'm gonna be smiling
for days off that.

05:11.670 --> 05:12.920
Right, Mom?

05:14.210 --> 05:16.080
Now I get it.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.460
What?

05:17.460 --> 05:20.790
You two planned this
so I'd snap out of it.

05:20.790 --> 05:24.830
Like depression is a switch
I can just flip on and off?

05:24.830 --> 05:26.330
That's not
what this is.

05:26.330 --> 05:28.000
I'm gonna lie down
upstairs.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.710
Uh, I-I brought us biscuits
from Busters, Mom.

05:29.710 --> 05:32.880
I th-- I thought we could, uh,
eat before I go to class.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.540
I'm tired.

05:38.210 --> 05:39.290
The meds aren't working.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.040
The doctor said
it's gonna take a few weeks.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.290
She could kill herself
by then.

05:44.290 --> 05:46.330
Would you please
stop making that joke?

05:46.330 --> 05:47.710
Where's the joke?

05:47.710 --> 05:49.290
Okay, well, then,
take her to the doctor

05:49.290 --> 05:51.830
and ask them to inject her
with lithium or something.

05:51.830 --> 05:53.170
I don't have a car.

05:53.170 --> 05:55.080
I'll leave mine here.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.580
I don't have a license,
either.

05:56.580 --> 05:59.120
Remember? The thing with
Mrs. Anderson's station wagon...

06:00.620 --> 06:02.000
I'm not
the only adult here.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.250
Alright, you're right.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.620
I'm sorry.
Give me the keys.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.120
I'll drive
like an old lady.

06:18.080 --> 06:20.500
Ohh, my L2.

06:23.790 --> 06:25.380
That the best you got?

06:25.380 --> 06:26.580
I'm just getting started.

06:26.580 --> 06:27.880
Go hard.

06:27.880 --> 06:28.750
Get mad at the bag.

06:31.830 --> 06:33.960
Picture an ex.
Come on.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.380
Alright.

06:35.380 --> 06:37.580
Stop. I can't talk about
an ex on the first date.

06:37.580 --> 06:38.750
It's as bad
as politics.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.080
Just so you know,

06:42.080 --> 06:43.420
I don't hook up
with Republicans.

06:43.420 --> 06:45.120
Hey, registered
Independent here.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.040
You got proof?

06:47.040 --> 06:48.250
Back at my place.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.500
Alright.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.420
Let's go.

06:53.420 --> 06:55.540
Let's see
if you can get lucky.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.080
I got Michaela
over here.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.540
Now it's my turn
to cash in.

07:02.540 --> 07:03.920
How much money
do you need?

07:03.920 --> 07:06.080
As much as
you're willing to give.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.380
Why, though?
What's it for?

07:07.380 --> 07:08.750
To disappear.

07:08.750 --> 07:12.250
Ever since Sam died,
the FBI's been gunning for me.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.790
'Cause you're guilty?
No.

07:13.790 --> 07:15.210
Well, then,
what you need is not money,

07:15.210 --> 07:16.250
but a great lawyer.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.290
I'm the great lawyer.

07:17.290 --> 07:18.880
And I know you know people
who do this.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.330
Even if I do, Annalise,

07:20.330 --> 07:21.790
it's gonna cost you
a lot more than you think.

07:21.790 --> 07:22.920
That's not my problem.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.080
It's also my money.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.500
Money that you wouldn't have
if I hadn't kept

07:25.500 --> 07:27.080
your dirty Michaela secret
all this time.

07:31.290 --> 07:34.210
Listen,
I'll talk to Michaela again.

07:34.210 --> 07:35.880
Just see
what my options are.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.500
Yeah,
I'll make a few calls.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.080
Old habits die hard,
huh?

07:40.080 --> 07:41.460
What?

07:41.460 --> 07:43.080
You still like
to quit things.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.290
I haven't quit a damn thing
my whole life.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.120
Not true.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.420
You quit us.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.960
You this creepy
when Connor's asleep?

07:59.960 --> 08:02.790
I feel like
I could've prevented this.

08:02.790 --> 08:04.880
Let me guess.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.420
Connor told you
this was your fault?

08:06.420 --> 08:07.460
No.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.000
Yeah.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.670
Well, he's wrong.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.080
You sure there's not
anything I can do?

08:15.080 --> 08:17.330
Like ice?
Or a foot massage?

08:17.330 --> 08:19.920
Tell me a story.
Distract me.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.080
Well, uh...

08:22.080 --> 08:24.380
I had my first threesome.

08:24.380 --> 08:25.380
Really?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.210
Oliver, out.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.250
Bonnie said
I couldn't --

08:28.250 --> 08:30.170
Who you gonna listen to,
me or Bonnie?

08:39.460 --> 08:42.290
You think I had something to do
with Laurel's disappearance?

08:42.290 --> 08:43.960
I was just repeating
what I was told.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.080
You and I came up with
our own lie that night.

08:47.750 --> 08:49.040
Or did you forget?

08:50.380 --> 08:52.330
Miller begged for the transfer
to happen at night

08:52.330 --> 08:54.420
before Xavier wanted,
so the shooting wouldn't happen.

08:54.420 --> 08:55.880
He was innocent.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.000
They can't know.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.620
Maybe we should
just tell them.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.880
Bonnie almost
killed herself.

09:00.880 --> 09:03.250
Is that what you want?

09:03.250 --> 09:04.710
For her to complete it
this time?

09:14.290 --> 09:15.710
What are you doing?

09:17.750 --> 09:19.500
There's no way
I'm letting your high ass

09:19.500 --> 09:21.210
bare your soul.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.830
Xavier says
he has Wes' confession.

09:28.250 --> 09:29.210
What do we do?

09:31.420 --> 09:33.420
Don't worry about it.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.830
I got it.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.460
You feel like
bitch-slapping the Castillos?

09:39.460 --> 09:40.920
Isn't that
what they usually do to us?

09:40.920 --> 09:42.670
Well, that's because
we usually play defense.

09:42.670 --> 09:44.380
But no more.

09:44.380 --> 09:45.920
We're gonna file
a restraining order

09:45.920 --> 09:47.120
against the whole family.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.210
Because a piece of paper
is supposed to scare them?

09:49.210 --> 09:50.290
It'll make
the court aware

09:50.290 --> 09:51.920
that they'll do anything
to take us down.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.170
Or kill us.

09:53.170 --> 09:54.290
What's your strategy,
then?

09:54.290 --> 09:55.580
Roll over? Quit?

09:55.580 --> 09:57.040
Is that what you all
have learned from me

09:57.040 --> 09:58.620
for the last three years?

09:58.620 --> 10:00.250
What do we do?

10:00.250 --> 10:02.540
Draft a petition
for a restraining order.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.460
List every horrible thing
they've ever done --

10:04.460 --> 10:06.790
Frank's beating,
Laurel's disappearance.

10:06.790 --> 10:07.960
Sandrine's head
in a box.
Quiet!

10:10.080 --> 10:11.330
Alright, everybody,
take your seat.

10:11.330 --> 10:13.460
We have a lot of bar prep
to do today.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.120
Hey.
What was that about?

10:19.120 --> 10:21.540
Like I'm ever telling you
anything ever again.

10:21.540 --> 10:22.080
What?

10:23.880 --> 10:26.460
You told Annalise
I found Solomon.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.500
Yeah.
We're fighting again.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.000
Michaela!

10:42.620 --> 10:44.540
If this is some new
fake apology, there's no need.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.750
I have no intention
of apologizing.

10:46.750 --> 10:48.080
You lied to my face.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.830
For Solomon.

10:49.830 --> 10:52.000
Last I knew, he didn't want
to have anything to do with you.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.670
This was about
protecting me? Bull!

10:53.670 --> 10:55.380
Listen.

10:55.380 --> 10:58.880
Alright, you hate me
all you want. I can take it.

10:58.880 --> 11:01.830
But why go through
all this trouble finding him

11:01.830 --> 11:03.380
just to push him away?

11:03.380 --> 11:05.380
I was taking a second
to think.

11:05.380 --> 11:07.710
And maybe I would've
given him a chance,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.790
but then he used you
to lie and ambush me.

11:09.790 --> 11:12.080
So, he's not the fantasy
you dreamed of?

11:12.080 --> 11:13.580
See...

11:13.580 --> 11:14.540
that's the problem.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.880
He is.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.330
He's not some guy in jail

11:17.330 --> 11:19.290
or someone who had no choice
but to give me up.

11:19.290 --> 11:21.170
He is the actual
fairy-tale version

11:21.170 --> 11:22.540
of what
a father should be,

11:22.540 --> 11:24.500
and still,
he chose himself over me.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.120
So, now I don't know
how to feel.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.710
Listen.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.500
I know what it's like
to hate your father.

11:35.500 --> 11:39.040
Just thinking about mine
right now makes my heart hurt.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.790
But hating him
is just gonna hurt you.

11:42.790 --> 11:45.500
Make sure you're pushing him
away for the right reasons.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.420
Lindsey.
Solomon Vick here.

12:17.420 --> 12:20.540
Listen, I might have
a new client for you.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.380
You ever take a break
from work?

12:26.380 --> 12:28.120
Not unless I have
a good reason.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.710
I'm not a good reason?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.170
I haven't decided yet.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.250
What was the long game
here, Nate?

12:47.250 --> 12:49.750
To get me
all hot and bothered,

12:49.750 --> 12:50.750
then what?

12:50.750 --> 12:52.380
I'd spill secrets
about my ex?

12:55.960 --> 12:58.420
Tegan had nothing to do
with your father's death.

12:58.420 --> 13:00.380
Says her ex-wife.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.210
Why would she have
anything to do with that?

13:02.210 --> 13:04.210
'Cause she works
for the Castillos.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.330
Worked for them.

13:05.330 --> 13:06.920
Why does she have
half a mil in stock

13:06.920 --> 13:08.540
from a company
Laurel Castillo owns?

13:08.540 --> 13:10.790
Jorge gave her that stock
over 10 years ago.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.750
Why?

13:14.000 --> 13:17.170
Well, that is
a question for Tegan.

13:17.170 --> 13:19.790
Now, do you want
to ask her yourself,

13:19.790 --> 13:23.290
or should I send her
this recording that I just made?

13:23.290 --> 13:24.670
Nate: Why?

13:24.670 --> 13:27.080
Cora: Well, that is
a question for Tegan.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.500
Now, do you want
to ask her yourself

13:29.500 --> 13:32.420
or should I send her this
recording that I just made?

13:32.420 --> 13:34.330
I've been telling him
he's wrong.

13:34.330 --> 13:37.170
Was that before or after
you came here as his spy?

13:37.170 --> 13:39.500
You know how bad
things have been.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.750
It's made us
all paranoid.

13:40.750 --> 13:41.960
It's made you all
stupid.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.540
Does Annalise
know about this?

13:44.540 --> 13:45.920
No.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.460
Good.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.670
Then I only need to fire
one employee today.

13:49.670 --> 13:51.460
This is
between you and Nate.

13:51.460 --> 13:53.620
Get your shady ass
the hell out of my firm.

14:04.330 --> 14:05.750
I really don't get it.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.120
Which part?

14:07.120 --> 14:08.290
Quitting a job
that lets you work

14:08.290 --> 14:10.080
at a campus
this beautiful.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.170
My life is only beautiful
on the outside.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.540
My private jet
on the way?

14:15.540 --> 14:18.040
Reached out to my contacts,
and things are in motion.

14:18.040 --> 14:19.540
Tell him to hurry.
Her.

14:19.540 --> 14:20.710
And it's not as simple

14:20.710 --> 14:22.710
as sending you on a jet
to some beach.

14:22.710 --> 14:23.880
I know that.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.790
So, you know
what you're about to lose?

14:25.790 --> 14:28.000
Everything that makes your life
worth living?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.750
Your mother, friends, work --
it's all gone.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.080
I'm not
the only quitter here.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.380
What?

14:33.380 --> 14:34.750
You ditched
your legal aid dreams

14:34.750 --> 14:36.540
as soon as big law
came calling.

14:36.540 --> 14:38.920
You and your $500 million
regret that decision now?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.250
What, 'cause money
buys happiness?

14:40.250 --> 14:41.250
Money could
make life easier.

14:41.250 --> 14:42.080
Not always.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.170
Well,
I'll take my chances.

14:45.790 --> 14:49.120
Is Michaela involved in whatever
it is you're running from?

14:49.120 --> 14:51.210
I told you
what I'm running from.

14:51.210 --> 14:52.710
You also said
you weren't guilty.

14:52.710 --> 14:53.500
I'm not.

14:53.500 --> 14:54.670
Innocent people

14:54.670 --> 14:56.960
don't ditch their lives
this easily, Annalise.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.880
All this coming from a man
who abandoned his daughter

14:58.880 --> 15:00.210
like it was no big deal.

15:00.210 --> 15:02.210
And you see
how much I regret that.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.250
If you want to be
a part of Michaela's life,

15:06.250 --> 15:07.790
chase her.

15:07.790 --> 15:11.080
She deserves nothing less,
with how much you hurt her.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.960
She wants to feel wanted.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.170
Like all of us.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.210
Get me my damn jet.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.620
AK is gonna be
so proud of us!

15:24.620 --> 15:26.210
Connor:
That's literally never happened.

15:26.210 --> 15:27.710
Yeah, but this petition
is so pretty.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.290
I'd definitely restrain
someone off of this.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.170
You forgot
to put Emmett's murder.

15:34.170 --> 15:35.380
That was ruled
a heart attack.

15:35.380 --> 15:36.540
Just put it down.

15:36.540 --> 15:38.040
And, oh,
don't forget that, uh,

15:38.040 --> 15:40.290
Connor is actually Emmett's
secret love child with Tegan.

15:40.290 --> 15:41.620
What?

15:41.620 --> 15:43.750
Oh, you know, that's why
Annalise picked him for the K5.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.710
You know, at this point,
I would buy that.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.460
Asher, it's Chloe!
You there?

15:48.460 --> 15:49.880
Why is she here?

15:49.880 --> 15:52.040
She probably
wrecked my car.

15:52.040 --> 15:53.250
Asher!

15:55.250 --> 15:56.920
Why aren't you answering
your phone?

15:56.920 --> 15:58.120
Busy. What's wrong?

15:58.120 --> 15:59.750
Our mother.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.750
She told me I was the biggest
disappointment of her life.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.540
Yeah, that's true.

16:03.540 --> 16:05.670
Well, I cannot take
any more emotional abuse.

16:05.670 --> 16:08.080
I need a night off
to feel normal.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.710
And that
has to happen here?

16:09.710 --> 16:11.790
We have exams coming up.

16:11.790 --> 16:13.710
You mean you hate me.

16:13.710 --> 16:14.880
No! We don't.

16:14.880 --> 16:16.120
Not...really.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.750
I like your hair.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.040
Liar.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.830
I just don't have
any friends in town.

16:20.830 --> 16:22.540
I blew them all off
when I moved to Vegas.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.540
Can I drink this?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.210
Ohh!
Wow, this is bad.

16:31.210 --> 16:33.000
You guys
really are poor, aren't you?

16:43.290 --> 16:45.040
What conspiracy theories
about me

16:45.040 --> 16:46.830
can I disabuse you of,
Nate?

16:46.830 --> 16:48.580
That I killed Emmett,
your father?

16:48.580 --> 16:49.420
Did you?

16:50.960 --> 16:53.620
Let me in
so we can talk about this.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.500
Thank you.

16:58.500 --> 16:59.710
Listen.

17:02.790 --> 17:06.380
On the graves of my siblings,
parents, and grandparents,

17:06.380 --> 17:08.620
I swear to God,
I had nothing to do

17:08.620 --> 17:11.250
with the tragedy
that was your father's death.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.500
Your whole family's dead?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.830
You didn't find that out
with all your stalking?

17:15.830 --> 17:17.250
It's hard to find
anything about you.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.330
I know the pain
of losing the people you love.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.210
I know
how it can make you...

17:25.210 --> 17:27.880
angry in ways
you never felt angry before.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.620
Get to the point.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.210
It wasn't me.

17:31.210 --> 17:33.710
The sooner
you accept that,

17:33.710 --> 17:35.540
the sooner you can
get over this grief.

17:41.250 --> 17:42.920
Jorge teach you
how to lie this good?

17:47.170 --> 17:49.710
Wow.

17:51.330 --> 17:52.120
Wow.

17:55.710 --> 17:57.000
Come at me again,

17:57.000 --> 17:59.250
you'll be seeing your father
sooner than you think.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.330
Chloe: And...

18:07.330 --> 18:10.460
Now, okay.
Don't let go, okay?

18:10.460 --> 18:11.960
Good! Now dip me,
but hold me tight,

18:11.960 --> 18:13.620
like someone you want to do
butt stuff with.

18:14.420 --> 18:15.500
Oh!

18:15.500 --> 18:16.750
Yes!

18:16.750 --> 18:17.920
Why is this
happening?

18:17.920 --> 18:20.000
Asher:
It's the hot mess express, Ols.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.330
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

18:21.330 --> 18:22.580
She couldn't
keep it together a week

18:22.580 --> 18:24.080
to take care
of our depressed mother.

18:24.080 --> 18:26.000
Family sucks.
Not all family.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.170
Asher's mom only invited him
back in because she needs him.

18:28.170 --> 18:29.420
That's not actual love.

18:29.420 --> 18:30.830
Ouch.

18:30.830 --> 18:33.000
I only say that because
I want what's best for you.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.500
They have a lot more
apologizing to do

18:34.500 --> 18:35.500
before
you forgive them.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.330
Same goes
for richy rich Solomon.

18:37.330 --> 18:38.710
Damn straight.

18:38.710 --> 18:41.040
No, what I meant was
our family --

18:41.040 --> 18:42.460
us, in this house.

18:42.460 --> 18:43.500
We don't suck.

18:43.500 --> 18:44.750
Chloe: Uh, Oliver?

18:44.750 --> 18:46.580
Just so you know,
I'm stealing your husband.

18:46.580 --> 18:47.880
Well, then you better
grow a penis.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.080
How do you know
I don't already have one?

18:49.080 --> 18:50.460
And, boy, is it pretty.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.420
Please make it stop.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.000
How was work?

19:00.000 --> 19:01.580
Fine.

19:01.580 --> 19:03.420
But I asked for
the rest of the week off.

19:03.420 --> 19:05.380
You don't have to do that.

19:05.380 --> 19:06.170
Too late.

19:08.790 --> 19:10.290
Mm.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.620
What'd you and Annalise
talk about?

19:16.790 --> 19:18.500
Oliver told me
she stopped by.

19:20.830 --> 19:23.210
She talk about Laurel?

19:23.210 --> 19:25.210
Just to promise
she didn't know where she is.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.290
You're sweating.

19:29.290 --> 19:30.750
I'm fine.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.830
Where are
your painkillers?

19:33.830 --> 19:36.710
I told Oli
to flush them.

19:36.710 --> 19:38.040
Annalise took them?

19:38.040 --> 19:39.080
No.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.420
And I'm fine.

19:40.420 --> 19:43.040
You know I got
a high pain threshold.

19:45.170 --> 19:48.670
I'm gonna call the doctor
for a new prescription.

20:05.540 --> 20:07.580
The petition for the restraining
order is ready to go.

20:07.580 --> 20:10.120
But not until you tell me
why you chose me for the K5.

20:10.120 --> 20:11.790
What do you mean?
He's a bit obsessed.

20:11.790 --> 20:13.420
You blame him,
considering why you picked me?

20:13.420 --> 20:14.920
Honestly?
I don't remember.

20:14.920 --> 20:16.920
Come on.
I'm serious.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.040
I have no memory.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.380
That's how boring
the reason must be.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.580
Okay, before you file that,
can we talk about

20:21.580 --> 20:23.790
if we really want to poke
the Castillo bear again?

20:23.790 --> 20:25.290
We're playing offense.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.290
I'm gay, so sports metaphors
mean nothing to me.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.830
Frank almost died.

20:29.830 --> 20:31.460
Laurel and Christopher
might be dead.

20:31.460 --> 20:33.210
The only one walking the streets
is Xavier.

20:33.210 --> 20:35.330
But instead of
the FBI focusing on him,

20:35.330 --> 20:37.460
they're coming after us.

20:37.460 --> 20:39.540
This might finally get them
to protect us.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.210
What if it backfires?

20:41.210 --> 20:44.790
Then we'll know
that we went down with a fight.

20:47.290 --> 20:49.040
Oh, my God.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.000
What is he
doing here?

20:51.670 --> 20:53.460
I have no clue.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.620
Is that Daddy?

20:54.620 --> 20:56.750
What the hell
are you doing here?

20:56.750 --> 20:58.620
I wanted to see you
in your element.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.750
Yes, my element,
to which you are not invited.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.960
Mr. Vick?
Asher Millstone.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.080
I'm a huge admirer
of your daughter.
The biggest, in fact.

21:05.080 --> 21:06.580
You must be the boyfriend.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.120
No, he's not.
Although I was.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.420
Actually, that would be me.
Gabriel Maddox.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.250
No.
This is not happening.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.500
Everyone, move!

21:14.500 --> 21:15.830
You, follow me.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.670
Looks like she didn't want you
to meet the dad.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.040
Hmm.

21:24.540 --> 21:26.120
You two
have a lot to discuss,

21:26.120 --> 21:28.250
so I'll just
leave you to it.

21:28.250 --> 21:29.580
I'm here to see you,
Michaela.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.120
I'm busy.
With a case?

21:31.120 --> 21:32.580
Is, uh --
is this it?

21:32.580 --> 21:34.960
Hey! Have you ever heard
of attorney/client privilege?

21:34.960 --> 21:37.500
Come on! Test
my criminal law knowledge.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.620
You know what? I do have
a question for you, actually.

21:39.620 --> 21:41.120
It might make you
want to leave here,

21:41.120 --> 21:42.580
which is
definitely my point.

21:42.580 --> 21:43.670
Bring it.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.250
Well,
it's for the both of you.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.580
Were the two of you
ever together?

21:47.580 --> 21:50.210
You know...
romantically?

21:52.170 --> 21:53.330
Oh, my God.

21:54.420 --> 21:55.540
Tell me you're not
my mother.
Stop.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.000
Hey, anything's possible
at this point.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.290
Michaela,
I'm not your damn mother.

21:58.290 --> 22:00.420
Okay, enough of this.
We're all adults.

22:00.420 --> 22:03.290
No. Adults don't show up places
uninvited and unwanted.

22:03.290 --> 22:05.380
Now, if you two
will please excuse me,

22:05.380 --> 22:08.170
I'm gonna go to the restroom
to throw up!

22:13.420 --> 22:15.580
You said, "Chase her."

22:36.540 --> 22:37.790
You have 10 seconds
to say

22:37.790 --> 22:39.170
whatever the hell
you came to say.

22:39.170 --> 22:40.290
He approached me,
Tegan.

22:40.290 --> 22:41.670
Then you come to me
and tell me that.

22:41.670 --> 22:43.460
I wanted proof
that he was being shady.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.540
No. You wanted
to pour salt on the wound.

22:45.540 --> 22:47.920
Why? Telling me you never
loved me wasn't cruel enough?

22:47.920 --> 22:49.120
I never said
I didn't love you.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.540
Unh-unh.

22:50.540 --> 22:51.880
We don't need
to go there again.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.920
Just tell me this --

22:58.920 --> 23:00.380
Were you planning on
sleeping with him?

23:02.080 --> 23:03.170
No.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Do you know
how humiliating this is?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.170
Why?

23:09.170 --> 23:10.620
He's Annalise's ex,
Cora.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.120
He could've found out things
you don't want him to know.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.670
The flirting was
to distract him.

23:14.670 --> 23:15.250
Please.

23:17.960 --> 23:19.710
Why does it matter
if he's Annalise's ex?

23:20.830 --> 23:22.040
You like her?

23:26.210 --> 23:28.790
Stay the hell
out of my life.

23:40.330 --> 23:42.380
I think
your dad likes me.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.620
I don't care who he likes.
Well, I care.

23:43.620 --> 23:45.210
And maybe if the Castillos
don't murder us all,

23:45.210 --> 23:47.670
we can go out to dinner
tonight.

23:47.670 --> 23:49.250
More whispering?

23:50.540 --> 23:52.330
Was it about me
not being good enough

23:52.330 --> 23:53.330
to meet your father?

23:53.330 --> 23:54.500
Gabriel.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.790
Because that's
what Asher told me.

23:55.790 --> 23:57.210
Guilty as charged.

23:57.210 --> 23:58.540
The reason
you don't get to meet

23:58.540 --> 24:01.380
that man
who is not my father

24:01.380 --> 24:03.210
is because
we're still in a fight.

24:03.210 --> 24:06.040
Yeah. So, take your little
hurt feelings and skedaddle.

24:07.420 --> 24:08.500
Okay.

24:09.790 --> 24:11.620
You are
gonna forgive me.

24:11.620 --> 24:12.790
Don't put words
in my mouth.

24:12.790 --> 24:13.880
What she said.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.170
You wanna know why?

24:15.170 --> 24:18.080
Because I am a good man.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.880
We're rare.

24:19.880 --> 24:22.960
And any father that does
get the chance to meet me

24:22.960 --> 24:25.460
will be proud
that his daughter picked me.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.250
Because I'm gonna
change the world.

24:27.250 --> 24:29.670
I'm gonna make
our justice system better.

24:29.670 --> 24:34.120
Now, I would prefer it
if it were you by my side.

24:34.120 --> 24:36.620
You mean,
you by my side.

24:37.920 --> 24:40.210
You know what?
I would love that.

24:40.210 --> 24:41.880
You just
have to forgive me.

24:43.460 --> 24:45.790
I'll be over here
whenever you're ready.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.500
You're not actually
falling for that, are you?

24:59.380 --> 25:00.670
Oliver's not here.

25:00.670 --> 25:03.000
I came to talk to you.

25:07.170 --> 25:09.290
Why was I picked
for the K5?

25:09.290 --> 25:10.540
What?

25:10.540 --> 25:13.170
Annalise claims
that she doesn't remember.

25:13.170 --> 25:15.210
But you know where
all the skeletons are buried --

25:15.210 --> 25:16.420
literally.

25:16.420 --> 25:18.540
So...tell me.

25:18.540 --> 25:20.210
Why do you care
so much?

25:20.210 --> 25:21.380
How could I not care?

25:26.080 --> 25:27.620
Annalise didn't pick you.

25:30.750 --> 25:31.880
I did.

25:34.790 --> 25:36.290
You're lying.

25:36.290 --> 25:37.960
No.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.420
She always let us
pick one student.

25:40.420 --> 25:41.620
Frank chose Laurel.

25:41.620 --> 25:43.040
I chose you.

25:44.750 --> 25:46.080
Why?

25:46.080 --> 25:48.670
Your application essay.

25:48.670 --> 25:51.210
You wrote about getting
a gay conversion camp shut down

25:51.210 --> 25:52.670
when you were
an undergrad.

25:54.380 --> 25:57.170
You honestly expect me
to believe that?

25:57.170 --> 26:00.540
I'm an abuse survivor,
Connor.

26:00.540 --> 26:01.960
When I was a kid.

26:05.210 --> 26:07.170
So, to know
that you stood up for those kids

26:07.170 --> 26:09.830
when no one else would?

26:09.830 --> 26:12.500
I...wanted to know you.

26:14.250 --> 26:17.380
I'm -- I'm sorry
that happened to you.

26:17.380 --> 26:19.040
It was a long time ago.

26:20.670 --> 26:23.040
So was me being a guy
who helped people.

26:24.620 --> 26:27.170
It's like he died
with Sam.

26:27.170 --> 26:30.330
I think I was hoping
whatever reason I got picked

26:30.330 --> 26:32.710
would explain
why I'm this way.

26:35.580 --> 26:38.000
You're not a bad guy,
Connor.

26:39.670 --> 26:41.040
I'm just tired.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.250
We all are.

26:46.330 --> 26:49.040
Nothing good comes
from hating yourself.

26:55.210 --> 26:57.330
You deserve a lot more good
than what you've had.

26:59.670 --> 27:02.170
So do you.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.830
Girl,
put your phone down.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.210
I got a story for you.

27:16.210 --> 27:17.330
Well, you better
make it fast.

27:17.330 --> 27:18.120
Nate and Cora.

27:19.710 --> 27:20.960
He approached her
to find out

27:20.960 --> 27:22.210
if I was still in bed
with the Castillos.

27:22.210 --> 27:23.080
No.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.460
He admitted it
to my face

27:24.460 --> 27:25.920
and sent Bonnie here
as his spy.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.580
I fired her ass.

27:27.580 --> 27:28.710
She didn't tell you?

27:29.790 --> 27:31.210
No.

27:31.210 --> 27:32.580
I-I don't have time
for this right now.

27:32.580 --> 27:34.500
What the hell else
is more important?

27:35.710 --> 27:38.420
I filed a restraining order
against the Castillos.

27:38.420 --> 27:39.540
Have you lost your mind?

27:39.540 --> 27:40.790
Probably.

27:40.790 --> 27:42.420
The last time
you took on this family,

27:42.420 --> 27:44.040
Emmett died
and you went on a bender.

27:45.710 --> 27:46.960
So, what is this?

27:46.960 --> 27:48.790
You got a thing
for a clapback?

27:48.790 --> 27:49.670
Or a death wish?

27:49.670 --> 27:50.830
Fear.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.880
That's why I'm doing it.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.120
So I don't have to
look over my shoulder
every second of the day.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.500
Only smart
to be scared.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.920
Well, that's where
me and you are different.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.420
Nate, too.

27:59.420 --> 28:00.540
Wait,
you're defending him?

28:00.540 --> 28:02.210
If you'd been through
what we've been through,

28:02.210 --> 28:04.380
you'd have learned
to fight, too.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.920
Otherwise, you're dead
before you've even died.

28:22.250 --> 28:23.880
What the hell is this?

28:23.880 --> 28:25.880
Why are you here?
I got subpoenaed.

28:25.880 --> 28:27.170
By who?
The people

28:27.170 --> 28:28.750
you're trying to bring
a restraining order against.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.790
They want me
to testify against you.

28:30.790 --> 28:33.000
What the hell have you
gotten me into here, Annalise?

28:39.120 --> 28:41.250
This is quite
a list of allegations

28:41.250 --> 28:42.710
against the Castillos,
Ms. Keating.

28:42.710 --> 28:44.080
That's why I'm here,
Judge.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.880
So I don't end up nearly dead
in a hospital,

28:45.880 --> 28:47.170
like Mr. Delfino.

28:47.170 --> 28:49.580
In order for the Castillo family
to defend themselves,

28:49.580 --> 28:51.670
we'd like to call Solomon Vick
to the stand, Your Honor.

28:51.670 --> 28:53.790
Mr. Vick doesn't know anything
about the Castillo family

28:53.790 --> 28:55.120
or my complaints
against them.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.580
Mr. Vick is aware

28:56.580 --> 28:58.460
of Ms. Keating's
own criminal activity, though.

28:58.460 --> 28:59.880
You want to talk
about criminal activity?

28:59.880 --> 29:01.460
Subpoena Xavier Castillo.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.170
Xavier Castillo
is out of the country.

29:03.170 --> 29:05.000
That's why we're calling
Mr. Vick to the stand.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.170
I'm gonna tell you exactly what
Mr. Vick is gonna say, Judge.

29:11.790 --> 29:14.460
I asked him to investigate ways
to flee the country.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.210
That's how terrified I am
of this family.

29:16.210 --> 29:18.380
Ms. Keating has
conveniently left out

29:18.380 --> 29:19.620
the illegal elements
of this plan.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.710
Since when is moving
out of the country a crime?

29:21.710 --> 29:23.880
Mr. Vick will make that clear,
Your Honor.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.210
Okay.

29:25.210 --> 29:26.620
Your Honor,
this is another example

29:26.620 --> 29:27.830
of the Castillos'
harassment.

29:27.830 --> 29:30.210
Let me decide that for myself,
Ms. Keating.

29:30.210 --> 29:33.000
Mr. Vick,
please take the stand.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.420
Hey, nurse.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.880
You're pretty good
at this.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.670
The meds are working,
huh?

29:51.670 --> 29:53.330
Like a charm.

29:57.380 --> 29:59.290
Can I tell you
something?

30:02.380 --> 30:03.460
Oregon.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.380
What are we waiting for?

30:08.040 --> 30:10.080
How about Oregon?

30:10.080 --> 30:11.670
They have
these beach towns

30:11.670 --> 30:14.580
with giant sand dunes
and trees.

30:17.960 --> 30:19.210
You chose
to come back here.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.830
I was scared then.

30:24.830 --> 30:26.170
But I'm not anymore.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.040
You're the only person
in my life that matters, Bon.

30:33.290 --> 30:34.580
Say yes.

30:37.540 --> 30:39.000
You're high.

30:40.750 --> 30:42.710
Go to sleep.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.120
Mr. Vick,
what is VIP Results?

30:52.120 --> 30:54.960
My understanding is
it's a high-end travel agency.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.580
Were you aware
of the illegal aspects

30:56.580 --> 30:58.460
of this
"high-end travel agency"

30:58.460 --> 31:01.460
when you hired them
to relocate Ms. Keating?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.210
Objection.
Testifying for the witness.

31:03.210 --> 31:05.210
Overruled.
Answer, Mr. Vick.

31:05.210 --> 31:06.830
I hired VIP Results

31:06.830 --> 31:09.750
with very little knowledge
of their process.

31:09.750 --> 31:11.670
Did you know that they create
fake passports?

31:11.670 --> 31:12.830
Objection. Prejudicial.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.290
Overruled.
Allow Mr. Vick to speak.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.330
I don't know
any of the specifics.

31:18.330 --> 31:20.380
So, there's no, uh,
phone recordings

31:20.380 --> 31:22.710
or paper trail
to contradict you?

31:22.710 --> 31:24.830
I'm only asking in case
you may have forgotten.

31:33.420 --> 31:35.620
I invoke my 5th Amendment right
against self-incrimination.

31:35.620 --> 31:36.750
Because you're involved

31:36.750 --> 31:38.580
in Ms. Keating's conspiracy
to murder?

31:38.580 --> 31:40.830
Objection. Pleading
the 5th cannot be used
against the witness.

31:40.830 --> 31:43.000
Sustained.
Are you just protecting
your daughter, Michaela Pratt?

31:43.000 --> 31:44.290
Counsel is in contempt,
Judge.

31:44.290 --> 31:45.620
Judge:
That's enough, Mr. Ballast.

31:45.620 --> 31:47.420
Are you aware that
your daughter, Michaela Pratt,

31:47.420 --> 31:49.120
is a murder suspect
along with Ms. Keating?

31:49.120 --> 31:51.000
Every word out of Mr. Ballast's
mouth is a lie, Your Honor.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.420
Check with the FBI.

31:52.420 --> 31:53.790
They will corroborate
that Ms. Keating

31:53.790 --> 31:55.250
is a person of interest
in this case.

31:55.250 --> 31:56.250
And how would you
know that?

31:56.250 --> 31:57.620
Do you have an in
with the FBI?

31:57.620 --> 31:59.500
You're bugging their phones,
just like you're doing Mr. Vick?

31:59.500 --> 32:01.290
I have no statements
on anyone's phones.

32:01.290 --> 32:03.460
Then how would you know
who Mr. Vick had spoken to?

32:03.460 --> 32:05.460
Or that I'd asked him
to research a move
out of the country?

32:05.460 --> 32:07.000
Why don't we ask Mr. Vick
the question?

32:07.000 --> 32:09.380
Your client owns
a major telecom company.

32:09.380 --> 32:10.790
Who else are you
illegally recording?

32:10.790 --> 32:12.000
Judge Gage here?

32:12.000 --> 32:13.040
I'm calling
for a recess.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.830
This is why
I want to run, Judge.

32:14.830 --> 32:17.080
Even if it means
considering illegal activities.

32:17.080 --> 32:18.830
So, you admit
to illegal behavior?

32:18.830 --> 32:20.170
I'm a partner
in a major law firm.

32:20.170 --> 32:21.750
I won
a damn Supreme Court case.

32:21.750 --> 32:23.670
I'm the most powerful
I've ever been.

32:23.670 --> 32:25.540
And here I am,
considering disappearing

32:25.540 --> 32:27.540
because I'm afraid
for my life.

32:27.540 --> 32:29.580
That's the reason
why we're here.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.790
Not to make up stories
about me being a killer,

32:31.790 --> 32:33.960
but to protect me
from Xavier Castillo.

32:35.460 --> 32:37.830
Or are you okay
with me dying, Judge?

32:39.210 --> 32:42.670
Either you protect me
or they kill me.

32:42.670 --> 32:44.210
It's your choice.

32:49.420 --> 32:50.420
Hey.

32:50.420 --> 32:51.710
We won
the restraining order.

32:51.710 --> 32:53.620
Tell everyone
to destroy their phones.

32:53.620 --> 32:54.790
What?

32:54.790 --> 32:56.830
Just do it.

32:56.830 --> 32:58.040
I could've
gotten arrested.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.670
They don't care about you.
They just want me.

32:59.670 --> 33:00.830
And my daughter,
apparently.

33:00.830 --> 33:02.420
Now she's your daughter?

33:02.420 --> 33:04.080
I asked you to look out for her,
but this is what you've done?

33:04.080 --> 33:06.380
You don't know the first thing
of what I've done for Michaela.

33:06.380 --> 33:07.880
What you've done is
destroyed any chance she had

33:07.880 --> 33:09.000
at an honest life.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.960
You're talking to me
about an honest life?

33:10.960 --> 33:13.380
I'm not perfect, but I also
ain't no damn murderer.

33:13.380 --> 33:16.120
You screwed your client's
wife and then went deadbeat
on that poor girl.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.920
Oh, don't try to pretend
that you care about her.
All to make bank
and sell out.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.170
Well, you didn't seem
to mind when you came
begging for that cash.

33:20.170 --> 33:21.830
Oh, you wanted
to give it to me.

33:21.830 --> 33:24.080
That's how bad
the guilt eats at you.

33:24.080 --> 33:25.580
I saw you
at your worst.

33:25.580 --> 33:28.000
Making Iris fall for you
so you can get between her legs.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.290
I cared for her.

33:29.290 --> 33:30.380
You used her,
just like you used me,

33:30.380 --> 33:32.250
just like
you're using Michaela.

33:32.250 --> 33:34.670
You know you're nothing without
a strong woman by your side.

33:34.670 --> 33:36.750
Oh, you think knowing how to
yell at people makes you strong?

33:36.750 --> 33:39.580
Mm, that suit,
that smile,

33:39.580 --> 33:42.500
that feminist crap
doesn't fool anyone.

33:42.500 --> 33:44.620
Soon as any woman meets you,
she sees you

33:44.620 --> 33:46.670
for the sad, lonely,
greedy bastard you are.

33:53.120 --> 33:54.920
Whenever this ends
for you,

33:54.920 --> 33:59.580
whether you are in jail
or asylum or a coffin,

33:59.580 --> 34:01.330
I hope that you can
finally let go

34:01.330 --> 34:03.710
of all that hate
inside of you.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.210
Dear God,
we thank you

34:17.210 --> 34:19.790
for bringing us together
as a family again.

34:19.790 --> 34:21.580
We also thank you

34:21.580 --> 34:24.120
for keeping
our dearly departed William,

34:24.120 --> 34:26.460
husband and father,

34:26.460 --> 34:30.080
by your side,
while he watches over us.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.880
And for returning Asher
to our family.

34:33.210 --> 34:35.120
May he one day
be forgiven for his sins.

34:38.290 --> 34:40.210
Amen. Asher,
would you pass the rice?

34:40.210 --> 34:41.670
What sins?

34:41.670 --> 34:44.000
U-Um, we were --
we're having a good night.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.250
Let her answer.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.040
She's sitting at the table.
Eating.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.830
Tell me you don't
still blame me for Dad dying.

34:48.830 --> 34:50.670
It doesn't matter,

34:50.670 --> 34:53.670
because I'm not mad
anymore, Asher.

34:55.210 --> 34:56.330
I forgive you.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.580
Are --

35:00.580 --> 35:01.540
You forgive me?

35:02.880 --> 35:05.500
I should be the one
forgiving you.

35:05.500 --> 35:07.960
You kicked me
out of the family.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.330
You broke my heart.

35:10.330 --> 35:13.000
Dad died,
and I was all alone.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.210
You want to talk
about depressed?

35:15.210 --> 35:17.210
I thought about...

35:17.210 --> 35:18.330
I thought about
killing myself.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.500
So,
where's your apology

35:21.500 --> 35:22.960
for turning your back
on your only son?

35:22.960 --> 35:25.000
The only way to Heaven

35:25.000 --> 35:28.120
is to beg forgiveness
for your sins.

35:31.460 --> 35:34.120
You can pray to God
all you want.

35:34.120 --> 35:36.880
You're the one
going to Hell, not me.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.880
Tegan: Annalise told me
to forgive you.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.830
Every bone in my body is telling
me that I should just go home

35:57.830 --> 36:00.000
and continue
hating you from afar.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.580
But I'm better than that.

36:01.580 --> 36:02.960
So are you.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.040
So I'm gonna help you
get what you want --

36:05.040 --> 36:07.120
at least so you'll stop
barking up the wrong tree.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.330
We'll file
a wrongful death lawsuit.

36:11.330 --> 36:13.120
Sue the prison, guards,
D.A.'s office.

36:13.120 --> 36:15.120
We'll get you
some big money.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.210
I don't want money.

36:16.210 --> 36:17.460
You want justice
for your father,

36:17.460 --> 36:19.120
for his killers
to be found out and suffer.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.080

Solomon: Michaela!

38:14.170 --> 38:15.290
I am taking you
out of here.

38:15.290 --> 38:16.710
That would be
kidnapping.

38:16.710 --> 38:18.670
You are in over your head,
Michaela.

38:18.670 --> 38:20.500
I think
that's actually you

38:20.500 --> 38:22.080
pretending you know
how to be a father.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.790
I know what Annalise
has got you involved in.

38:24.790 --> 38:25.830
I know.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.830
Leave.

38:29.830 --> 38:31.750
You want a father.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.080
I see that, Michaela.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.620
Well, fathers protect
the people they love.

38:35.620 --> 38:37.290
I can protect myself.

38:37.290 --> 38:39.420
I'm saying
you don't need to this time.

38:39.420 --> 38:41.750
And I am saying
I can save myself,

38:41.750 --> 38:43.120
just like I always have.

38:43.120 --> 38:45.040
The damn FBI's involved,
Michaela.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.120
And I grew up with every odd
stacked against me,

38:47.120 --> 38:48.290
but look
at what I've done.

38:48.290 --> 38:50.080
Yale, Middleton.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.540
God only knows what brilliance
I'll achieve after I graduate.

38:52.540 --> 38:57.620
I am literally
my ancestors' wildest dreams.

38:57.620 --> 39:00.380
So, can you imagine if
I actually had you growing up,

39:00.380 --> 39:02.670
with all your money
and contacts and privilege?

39:02.670 --> 39:04.830
I'd already be President.

39:04.830 --> 39:08.000
And you still can be, if you
would just let me help you.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.830
I'm good.

39:09.830 --> 39:11.790
Seriously.

39:11.790 --> 39:13.500
I'm gonna be President

39:13.500 --> 39:15.290
or...
a Supreme Court Justice

39:15.290 --> 39:17.670
or CEO of some planet.

39:17.670 --> 39:21.540
And when I do, I'll know
that I got there on my own,

39:21.540 --> 39:25.000
and you'll be really sorry
you're not by my side.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.790
So, thank you
for abandoning me.

39:27.790 --> 39:30.080
It made me even greater
than I already am.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.420
Please...

Family sucks.

40:21.830 --> 40:23.420
What happened?

40:23.420 --> 40:27.120
Just me being stupid enough
to think that they changed.

40:30.880 --> 40:33.330
They're not my family.

40:33.330 --> 40:35.290
You are.

40:35.290 --> 40:37.460
You've been there for me
when no one else was.

40:37.460 --> 40:39.500
Even when
you disappointed me,

40:39.500 --> 40:41.380
you still
always had my back.

40:43.210 --> 40:45.960
Do you know
how much that means to me?

40:45.960 --> 40:47.380
How much
you mean to me?

40:47.380 --> 40:49.210
You mean a lot
to me, too.

40:49.210 --> 40:51.040
Don't --
You don't have to say that.

40:51.040 --> 40:54.540
No, I-I should
tell you that more.

40:54.540 --> 40:57.170
Because you've always
had my back, too.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.210
Even when
I don't deserve it.

40:59.210 --> 41:00.790
You're the only man
in my life

41:00.790 --> 41:02.790
who hasn't lied to me
or left me.

41:02.790 --> 41:04.420
I'll never leave you,
Michaela.

41:04.420 --> 41:06.000
Even if we don't
end up together,

41:06.000 --> 41:07.830
I want to be there for you
for the rest of your life.

41:09.620 --> 41:11.210
I'm still in love with you,
Michaela.

41:13.170 --> 41:15.040
I always will be.

41:20.250 --> 41:21.830
Is this okay?

41:39.000 --> 41:40.290
You're worried
about Gabriel.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.120
Yeah.

41:43.290 --> 41:45.710
He's not the one,
Michaela.

41:45.710 --> 41:47.420
It's me.

41:59.420 --> 42:00.170
Asher?

42:00.170 --> 42:02.040
What are you doing here?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.080
Asher.
