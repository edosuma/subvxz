00:30.165 --> 00:32.715
<i>Make sure other units
don't get mixed in.</i>

00:34.788 --> 00:36.938
Yes, we are the conquering heroes.

00:39.267 --> 00:41.478
- Check it out.
- Look at this, Gents.

00:42.252 --> 00:45.941
Little more than 48 hours into the war,
and the first Marine division

00:46.236 --> 00:48.730
out of Camp Pendleton,
Oceanside, California,

00:48.850 --> 00:51.446
is rolling with impunity
on Saddam's highways.

00:53.266 --> 00:56.556
This sucks. We were on point
in front of the whole invasion.

00:56.726 --> 00:58.876
Now we're back in the traffic jam.

00:59.707 --> 01:02.788
Trombley, how dare you question
the strategic plan?

"Get some"?

"Don't tread on me"?
"Let's roll"... Fuck, man.

01:24.488 --> 01:27.039
I hate
that fucking cheesy moto bullshit.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.106
Ray, when you're right, you're right.

01:29.226 --> 01:32.996
You know, it's like that song:
"When stars and stripes and eagles fly"?

01:33.166 --> 01:35.416
Fuck, man, eagles fly in Canada too.

01:35.851 --> 01:37.350
When we got back from Afghanistan

01:37.470 --> 01:40.787
my mom tried to play me that song
and I was all, "{uck no, }Mom. I'm a Marine.

01:40.999 --> 01:43.790
"I don't need to fly a little
fucking patriotic flag on my car

01:44.002 --> 01:45.932
"to show that I'm patriotic. "

01:46.102 --> 01:48.077
That song is straight homosexual

01:52.578 --> 01:54.461
"Nasiriyah. "

Hey, Q-Tip?

01:57.508 --> 02:00.390
Your truck's all blinged out.
How you gonna refuel it?

<i>Echo Four Papa, I think
that haji's getting sweet on you.</i>

02:08.727 --> 02:10.477
Brad, this fucking sucks!

02:12.098 --> 02:14.112
We're in the rear
with the fucking chicks,

02:14.441 --> 02:17.195
the supply trucks and the haji truckers.

02:17.715 --> 02:20.945
We trained for that bridge mission
for six fucking weeks

02:21.115 --> 02:23.436
and they take it right out
from underneath of us.

02:23.556 --> 02:27.500
Yeah, I'll be mad if this war ends
before we get a chance to get in it.

02:28.227 --> 02:30.755
Drop down here, my little brown friend.

02:34.009 --> 02:36.428
Missions are always getting fragged.

02:36.998 --> 02:38.204
We're Marines.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.130
We obey our orders.

02:41.936 --> 02:44.768
Our mission now
is not to do our original mission.

02:50.015 --> 02:51.206
Sempergumby...

02:51.421 --> 02:52.806
Always flexible.

02:56.855 --> 02:59.956
Are we supposed
to put our cammie nets up or what?

03:10.645 --> 03:12.111
I'm taking a shit.

03:24.260 --> 03:26.946
<i>Hitman Two One Alpha,
this is Hitman Two. Over.</i>

03:28.260 --> 03:30.072
Standing by to copy. Over.

<i>I need Two One actual on the hook. Over.</i>

03:35.387 --> 03:36.837
Two One actual is...

03:37.074 --> 03:38.218
on a mission.

03:38.388 --> 03:39.538
Taking a dump.

03:40.135 --> 03:42.385
First combat dump in country. Over.

03:43.562 --> 03:46.955
<i>Two One, when he returns,
have Two One actual contact me.</i>

03:47.250 --> 03:48.750
<i>- Over.
- Roger that.</i>

03:51.411 --> 03:52.502
Captain sir!

03:53.199 --> 03:55.649
Where'd you get that nice looking A.K.?

03:56.009 --> 03:59.134
Part of a cache we found in a culvert
near where we took those prisoners.

04:00.201 --> 04:01.951
Well-oiled, pretty clean.

04:03.247 --> 04:05.374
Not bad for a third-world army.

04:07.762 --> 04:08.737
Corporal,

04:09.090 --> 04:10.930
stow this next to my seat.

04:11.992 --> 04:13.307
Gotta be prepared.

04:13.576 --> 04:15.926
Never know when you might need an A.K.

04:16.450 --> 04:18.433
That's why you're in charge, sir.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.372
Captain America, man!

04:24.260 --> 04:25.517
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

04:25.637 --> 04:28.517
To think I believed the judge
when he told me the Marine corps

04:28.637 --> 04:30.887
was a superior alternative to jail.

04:31.631 --> 04:33.877
I should have shut up and done my time.

04:42.569 --> 04:45.584
I don't want none of you ladies
moping and crying.

04:46.637 --> 04:48.387
Mustaches gots to go now.

04:49.824 --> 04:50.686
Turd!

04:51.439 --> 04:53.761
Scrape that hippy shit off your lip.

04:54.811 --> 04:55.752
Screwby.

04:57.426 --> 04:59.194
Are you mocking the grooming standard?

04:59.821 --> 05:01.337
Naw, Sergeant Major.

05:02.284 --> 05:03.475
It's screwby.

05:06.123 --> 05:09.791
I wants to see clean purty smiles
before we step off.

05:25.514 --> 05:27.055
- Good dump, Sergeant?
- Excellent.

05:27.379 --> 05:28.556
Shit my brains out.

05:29.591 --> 05:31.343
Not too hard, not too runny.

05:31.605 --> 05:33.906
It sucks when it's runny
and you have to wipe 50 times.

05:34.026 --> 05:35.618
That's not what I'm talking about.

05:35.738 --> 05:38.108
If it's too hard or too soft,
something's not right.

05:38.693 --> 05:40.902
You might have a problem
that affects combat readiness.

05:41.114 --> 05:42.862
And it should be a little bit acid.

05:43.074 --> 05:45.198
Burn your asshole a little
when it comes out.

05:45.409 --> 05:47.664
Maybe on your little bitch asshole, Ray,

05:47.784 --> 05:49.781
from all the cock
that's been stuffed up it.

05:49.901 --> 05:53.499
Man, we Marines are so homoerotic.
It's all we talk about.

05:53.986 --> 05:56.180
You ever realize
how homoerotic this whole thing is?

05:56.300 --> 05:58.176
Lt. wants to see you, Brad.

05:58.968 --> 06:00.294
Shit, homes.

06:00.545 --> 06:03.381
I forgot to tell you
he was on the radio for you.

06:03.551 --> 06:04.501
I'm sorry.

06:06.485 --> 06:09.491
Garza, how are your legs? They all right
standing in that turret all day?

06:09.611 --> 06:12.600
Good, Gunny. I'm mexican...
too hard to feel nothing from that.

06:12.986 --> 06:14.477
I got retard strength.

06:15.460 --> 06:18.231
I got good news, guys.
We're staying here on 25% watch.

06:18.513 --> 06:20.930
That means three of you
get to sleep a couple hours.

06:21.050 --> 06:21.850
Sleep?

06:22.592 --> 06:24.821
What kind of fucked-up war is this?

06:25.408 --> 06:26.650
It's not good.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.117
Cas-evac bird's been going
back and forth since sundown.

06:29.412 --> 06:32.438
Sir, the fucking army
declared Nasiriyah secured.

06:32.652 --> 06:33.955
It was on the net.

06:34.498 --> 06:37.917
Whatever's going on up there, it doesn't
sound to me like we've secured anything.

06:39.819 --> 06:40.857
Reporter!

06:41.246 --> 06:42.862
- What?
- If you lay with your cock

06:42.982 --> 06:46.648
against the ground as the tank goes by,
it feels fucking great.

06:47.305 --> 06:48.614
Come on, do it!

06:56.731 --> 06:58.446
- You're dismissed.
- Hey, Rudy!

06:58.566 --> 07:02.427
- I forgot my baby wipes.
- Use your hand, you nasty thing.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.616
Come here and wipe my ass,
you heartless fuck.

07:04.736 --> 07:06.486
I'm fucking ashamed, dawg.

07:06.677 --> 07:10.327
Back in Afghanistan we didn't leave
a speck of americana behind.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.424
Brah,

07:11.690 --> 07:13.963
could you imagine
if hajis invaded our country

07:14.083 --> 07:16.555
and started shitting
in people's suburban yards?

07:16.675 --> 07:17.725
Not really.

07:29.027 --> 07:30.637
You guys in Alpha getting some?

07:30.928 --> 07:32.930
Same as you dick smokers in Bravo.

07:33.050 --> 07:34.200
Oh shit, look.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.761
- Cody's got a diary.
- Get some, Brah.

07:38.023 --> 07:39.430
- Give it back.
- No, listen.

07:39.550 --> 07:41.481
"Leading men into battle is my calling. "

07:42.820 --> 07:43.983
Not bad, Corporal.

07:44.484 --> 07:47.112
"Since I was young,
I felt drawn to the warrior society. "

07:47.323 --> 07:48.446
That's a little gay.

07:49.031 --> 07:51.282
"Our minions are... " jeez.
"Our minions are rolling. "?

07:51.494 --> 07:53.574
John, he just called you a minion.

07:54.112 --> 07:56.262
"The people here live

07:56.533 --> 07:57.803
- "like rats. "
- Give it!

07:57.923 --> 08:01.000
"Hopefully what we are doing
will lead them to a better life. "

08:01.550 --> 08:05.505
Your calling wasn't to be a warrior,
man, it was to be a fucking retard.

08:08.303 --> 08:11.940
<i>...captured american soldiers,
some of them apparently wounded.</i>

08:12.110 --> 08:15.944
<i>The channel says the americans
were members of the army supply unit</i>

08:16.114 --> 08:20.113
<i>and were ambushed outside Nasiriyah.
And in fierce fighting in that city,</i>

08:20.300 --> 08:23.650
<i>U.S. Marines were said
to have suffered heavy casualties.</i>

08:23.986 --> 08:26.307
I heard the hajis are faking surrenders

08:26.477 --> 08:28.498
and using civilians to trick Marines.

08:28.618 --> 08:30.864
I don't {ucking }believe it.
How did so many of us get hit?

08:31.076 --> 08:34.451
Here we sit with our thumbs up our asses
{while Marines are dying a few kliks up the road. }while Marines die a few km from here.

08:35.652 --> 08:37.907
Why the fuck are there Iraqis
walking through our lines?

08:38.027 --> 08:40.097
Why the fuck
is there nobody up on our guns?{ Come on!}

08:40.217 --> 08:42.125
Jacks, get up in the turret.

08:42.631 --> 08:43.835
You guys got any oil?

08:47.378 --> 08:49.299
We've got orders
to bust north to Nasiriyah,

08:49.461 --> 08:51.176
support
the regimental combat team there.

08:51.296 --> 08:54.721
And there's been a change in the R.O.E.:
anyone with a weapon is {declared }hostile.

08:55.425 --> 08:58.243
If a woman walks away from you
with a weapon on her back, shoot her.

08:58.363 --> 09:01.541
If an armed Iraqi sells good humor
out of the back of a V.W., shoot him.

09:01.661 --> 09:03.616
I don't care if you hit him
with a 40mm grenade.

09:03.736 --> 09:05.047
Roger that, sir.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.317
Gear up, gents.

09:07.992 --> 09:09.042
Move it out!

09:09.176 --> 09:11.336
Close your fucking flak vest.

09:12.059 --> 09:14.146
Where's your Delta tourniquet?

09:15.453 --> 09:16.749
Come on, Trombley.

09:20.007 --> 09:21.451
Fucking keep it...

09:21.904 --> 09:22.766
Here.

09:27.774 --> 09:29.581
Where the fuck did you get this?

09:29.701 --> 09:30.560
What?

09:31.416 --> 09:32.592
- Ebay.
- Ebay?

09:36.465 --> 09:38.213
- Christopher?
- Yeah, doc?

09:38.383 --> 09:40.100
- You got rigger tape?
- Sure.

09:40.558 --> 09:41.718
Thank you, sir.

09:43.942 --> 09:45.828
Get your vehicles crossed to Miker-5.

09:45.948 --> 09:46.998
I got this.

09:49.115 --> 09:52.028
And this lunatic doesn't even know
he's in Iraq.

09:52.454 --> 09:54.176
Thinks he's a superhero

09:54.552 --> 09:56.191
from some japanese comic.

09:56.692 --> 10:00.019
I put on my superhero uniform
every day I'm in the corps, brother.

10:00.139 --> 10:00.989
Hoorah.

10:01.588 --> 10:03.012
Now we find our true dharma.

10:03.132 --> 10:05.204
Mike, Red-con One in five.

10:05.702 --> 10:06.952
Let's get it on!

10:07.380 --> 10:09.829
Budweiser,
we got our call signs straight?

10:10.540 --> 10:12.641
Hey, Leon, I thought you were mexican?

10:12.761 --> 10:13.561
I am.

10:13.762 --> 10:16.512
Then why aren't you loud
and stealing my shit?

10:17.294 --> 10:18.179
Let's go.

10:20.015 --> 10:22.475
Here comes the Marines, motherfuckers.
Look out.

10:22.595 --> 10:23.729
Fucking pog.

10:25.891 --> 10:27.091
What's a pog?

10:27.261 --> 10:29.967
Persons Other than Grunts.
Rear echelon guys...

10:30.137 --> 10:30.987
pussies.

10:31.992 --> 10:35.841
<i>All Hitman Two Victors be advised

We're prosecuting targets with Cobras.

10:59.382 --> 11:00.638
A supply company... army.

11:03.770 --> 11:04.520
Damn.

11:05.003 --> 11:06.644
And we ain't in the city yet.

11:06.898 --> 11:09.224
<i>Godfather, this is Hitman actual.</i>

<i>Take an overwatch position

11:50.025 --> 11:53.215
Victors, all Victors, get out
of your vehicles and take cover.

11:53.335 --> 11:55.551
Our sister company
is finally in this war.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.362
Out of the vehicles.

11:58.139 --> 12:00.448
How come Alpha gets to pop
their cherry and we don't?

12:00.750 --> 12:03.100
They have their mission, we have ours.

12:05.074 --> 12:06.849
Love this shit!

12:08.153 --> 12:10.626
We's in the middle of it now, boys!

12:12.815 --> 12:13.921
Garza,

12:14.215 --> 12:16.142
get your stupid ass down!

12:16.311 --> 12:18.299
Ain't nothing for you to shoot at.

12:18.461 --> 12:19.694
Fuck this shit, for sure.

12:19.814 --> 12:22.446
Sir, how long do we have to sit up here
with our nuts out getting shot at

12:22.566 --> 12:24.916
before R.C.T. One goes into the town?

12:25.252 --> 12:27.055
We sit here with our nuts exposed

12:27.175 --> 12:29.005
but when R.C.T. One assaults
over the bridge

12:29.125 --> 12:31.196
and we go in behind
to get their casualties,

12:31.316 --> 12:33.450
we get our nuts blown completely off.

12:35.156 --> 12:37.834
Alpha's getting smacked pretty good
down there.

12:38.438 --> 12:39.988
Shall we dig in, sir?

12:40.924 --> 12:42.490
That's not a bad idea.

12:49.292 --> 12:50.112
Lt.!

12:52.902 --> 12:56.507
Those grunts from R.C.T. One
are taking fire from across the river.

13:03.223 --> 13:04.523
Shit, Marine arty.

13:05.831 --> 13:07.981
- That was friendly.
- Corpsman!

13:09.521 --> 13:11.186
- Sir, request going...
- Go!

13:18.405 --> 13:19.755
I'm hit, I'm hit.

13:29.440 --> 13:30.489
Hey, buddy.

13:30.959 --> 13:32.749
I'm gonna give you a bandage. That okay?

13:33.376 --> 13:35.442
Push it on the wound.
You keep steady pressure.

13:35.562 --> 13:37.212
It's gonna be all right.

13:38.813 --> 13:41.225
Check for breathing. Stop the bleeding.

13:42.345 --> 13:43.843
I want to hear reports.

13:44.128 --> 13:45.152
Head wounds,

13:45.322 --> 13:46.889
chest wounds, bleeders.

13:52.770 --> 13:55.271
You guys see where that shot came from?

13:56.689 --> 13:58.798
Godfather, this is Assassin actual.
Over.

13:58.918 --> 14:00.026
<i>This is Godfather.</i>

14:00.437 --> 14:02.505
<i>- Send traffic. Over.
- Interrogative:</i>

14:02.625 --> 14:04.647
request permission
to engage unarmed targets,

14:04.767 --> 14:07.033
suspected enemy forward observers. Over.

14:07.242 --> 14:09.824
<i>Stand by, Assassin.
I'll confer with division.</i>

14:13.265 --> 14:15.336
Division approves change in the R.O.E.

14:15.456 --> 14:18.128
Assassin, this is Godfather.
Change in the R.O.E.

14:18.339 --> 14:19.921
<i>is approved. You are approved</i>

14:20.132 --> 14:22.882
to destroy unarmed targets
suspected as spotters. How copy?

14:23.585 --> 14:24.839
Solid copy. Out.

14:27.502 --> 14:30.245
We're cleared hot on civilian targets,
regardless of whether they're armed.

14:30.365 --> 14:32.459
If they're spotting those mortars,
take them{	he fuck out}.

14:32.579 --> 14:33.588
Roger that.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.239
Be 100% sure that these Marines...

14:47.479 --> 14:50.434
Sir, it's Colonel Dowdy from R.C.T. One
with General Mattis.

14:50.554 --> 14:52.101
They're up by the M.S.R.

15:06.229 --> 15:09.230
With the resistance we're seeing,
I'm concerned that initiating...

15:09.350 --> 15:11.431
The question is why {	he fuck }am I
standing here {looking }at a {ucking }bridge

15:11.551 --> 15:12.991
{	hat doesn't have my marines rolling across it. }that my Marines aren't crossing.

15:13.214 --> 15:16.671
Sir, we're 30 mikes from initiating
the armored assault to engage the enemy

15:16.791 --> 15:18.751
along the M.S.R. through the city.

15:18.871 --> 15:21.396
- Our problem has been refueling {	he }tanks.
- Not only "no", Colonel,

15:21.516 --> 15:22.859
but "fuck no". Okay?

15:23.118 --> 15:26.038
I don't give a rat's ass
about the resistance in the city.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.323
Your mission is
to punch through the city,

15:28.534 --> 15:31.377
put R.C.T. One north of it
where our objectives are.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.397
This is just a fucking sideshow.

15:35.823 --> 15:38.583
{You had }7,000 Marine riflemen {who have been }are ready
to go since{ for the past} 24 hours,

15:38.794 --> 15:40.847
and you're standing here
with your foot on your dick.

15:40.967 --> 15:43.236
No check that... Not your dick, my dick.

15:47.373 --> 15:48.134
Godfather,

15:48.428 --> 15:50.033
hold your Marines back for now.

15:50.153 --> 15:51.973
When Colonel Dowdy
{here }sees fit to unfuck himself

15:52.093 --> 15:55.643
and push through this fucking shithole,
I'll turn first recon loose.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.315
That'd be my Alpha company
taking out their spotters.

16:02.798 --> 16:05.503
I'd expect this mortar fire
to stop shortly, sir.

16:31.938 --> 16:33.112
How's it going?

16:36.787 --> 16:39.312
They shot one of my Marines
in the stomach...

16:39.506 --> 16:40.545
Out there.

16:40.987 --> 16:44.160
We returned fire,
blew a donkey's head off.

16:46.549 --> 16:48.099
We didn't see much else.

17:01.965 --> 17:03.836
Buddy, do you need anything?

17:07.684 --> 17:08.823
Food, water...

17:11.977 --> 17:13.261
It's all good, bro.

17:27.771 --> 17:28.818
Expect a fight.

17:31.453 --> 17:32.760
Expect casualties

17:33.137 --> 17:34.657
when we push through Nasiriyah.

17:36.166 --> 17:39.205
Task force Tarawa has been in that city
for 36 hours

17:39.958 --> 17:41.768
getting chopped up pretty good

17:42.585 --> 17:43.859
while we sit here

17:44.287 --> 17:46.198
with the regimental combat team,

17:46.318 --> 17:48.581
nursing our thumbs with our assholes.

17:50.450 --> 17:51.457
Gentlemen,

17:51.789 --> 17:53.343
what does Ferrando think?

17:55.056 --> 17:56.837
We have allowed the enemy

17:57.491 --> 17:59.557
to dictate the tempo of our movements.

18:01.002 --> 18:02.853
If it were up to Ferrando

18:03.963 --> 18:06.949
we would not have stopped
at the bridge this afternoon.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.922
We'd be through that city.

18:10.572 --> 18:12.031
But the good news is

18:12.999 --> 18:14.981
once we clear the Euphrates...

18:17.693 --> 18:19.589
General Mattis informs me

18:20.284 --> 18:22.876
that we are going to be in the game,
gentlemen.

18:24.621 --> 18:25.709
And when we play,

18:26.098 --> 18:26.898
we,

18:27.469 --> 18:28.627
not the enemy,

18:29.167 --> 18:31.116
are going to dictate the tempo.

18:32.058 --> 18:33.755
Once we're over the river,

18:34.603 --> 18:36.892
we're going to detach from the R.C.T.,

18:37.410 --> 18:38.221
push north

18:38.984 --> 18:40.066
and flank

18:40.594 --> 18:41.698
or destroy

18:42.579 --> 18:44.511
anyone who tries to stop us.

18:48.824 --> 18:51.125
All right, that's it for now, gentlemen.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.857
He didn't say anything
about the grooming standard.

18:55.977 --> 18:58.360
Is he giving us a pass
on our men not shaving?

18:58.480 --> 19:01.344
I'd interpret what he said to mean
facial hair is not going to be our focus

19:01.464 --> 19:02.787
for the next 24 hours.

19:08.138 --> 19:10.341
50% of Americans are obese.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.476
You know what obese means, right?

19:13.725 --> 19:15.191
Fat as a motherfucker.

19:15.543 --> 19:17.182
All these other countries,

19:17.567 --> 19:18.690
nobody's fat.

19:19.477 --> 19:21.205
Think about that shit, dawg.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.685
How does a motherfucker get fat?

19:25.049 --> 19:28.138
You gotta sit on a couch,
do nothing but eat

19:28.378 --> 19:30.085
and watch tv all day.

19:31.032 --> 19:33.317
White trash, poor mexicans and blacks...

19:33.910 --> 19:35.528
All obese as motherfuckers.

19:36.692 --> 19:39.105
The white man has created
a system with so much excess,

19:39.225 --> 19:41.581
that even poor motherfuckers are fat.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.753
A few years ago, dawg,

19:50.292 --> 19:52.876
I refused a diploma
from my community college.

19:53.182 --> 19:54.019
What?

19:54.274 --> 19:57.066
I didn't want no piece of paper
from the white master

19:57.186 --> 19:59.536
saying I was qualified for his world.

20:01.511 --> 20:03.108
Then I joined the corps.

20:04.259 --> 20:06.384
Figured you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

20:07.651 --> 20:08.453
See,

20:09.294 --> 20:11.407
that's what this is all about, dawg.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.712
The U.S. should just go
into all these fucked-up countries,

20:14.832 --> 20:15.651
Iraq,

20:16.080 --> 20:17.082
Africa,

20:17.442 --> 20:19.951
set up American government
and infrastructure...

20:20.071 --> 20:22.392
McDonald's, Starbucks, M.T.V...

20:22.701 --> 20:24.430
Then just hand it all over.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.844
How else are we going to make
these hungry motherfuckers

20:26.964 --> 20:28.821
want to stop killing everybody?

20:29.147 --> 20:31.538
Put a McDonald's
on every fucking corner.

20:32.509 --> 20:34.428
If we've got to blow up the corner

20:34.548 --> 20:36.886
then build the McDonald's, so be it.

20:38.017 --> 20:40.284
Enough lecture
on the white man's oppression.

20:40.404 --> 20:43.554
I need my assistant team leader
for a meeting with the L.T.

20:43.824 --> 20:47.045
I was just elucidating
on the white man's burden, dawg.

20:48.087 --> 20:50.837
- Now, Poke.
- You know I'm rollin' with you.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.837
Come on. Thanks, man.

21:03.899 --> 21:04.618
What?

21:06.316 --> 21:08.997
Just wanted to get
one last cigarette before we all died.

21:09.209 --> 21:12.082
BBC had that U.S. Army convoy hit here.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.251
Captured 11 soldiers.

21:14.860 --> 21:16.505
Showed them on arab tv.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.300
Abusing them on tv.

21:19.786 --> 21:22.094
Shit, they raped the one woman soldier.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.871
They broke her bones and then raped her.

21:25.134 --> 21:26.584
It was on Aljazeera.

21:27.417 --> 21:28.803
News for you, Gents,

21:28.973 --> 21:31.686
This neck of desert,
when they capture soldiers,

21:32.589 --> 21:34.230
not just the women get raped.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.385
In your dreams, Brad.
As we learned today from the eight hours

21:37.505 --> 21:40.685
we spent getting our asses shot at
by the Euphrates,

21:40.855 --> 21:42.451
the enemy's got some fight in him.

21:42.571 --> 21:46.228
I have no word on our mission,
but I assume we're going into Nasiriyah.

21:46.398 --> 21:48.507
Those are all Cas-evac birds.

21:48.893 --> 21:52.410
Word is that task force Tarawa's taken
200 casualties in that city.

21:52.719 --> 21:54.922
Any idea when we might get tasked
with going in?

21:55.042 --> 21:56.941
Godfather's meeting
with Company Commanders{ right now}.

21:57.061 --> 22:00.887
You all take advantage of the time now
to have your men get some shut-eye.

22:01.079 --> 22:01.835
L.T,

22:02.005 --> 22:03.802
what's the skinny on who
we{'re} fight{ing} in {	he }city?

22:04.081 --> 22:06.867
All I saw today were those guys
in black pajamas... irregulars.

22:06.987 --> 22:08.071
The Fedayeen.

22:09.085 --> 22:11.593
Guys in pajamas
stopped two Marine regiments?

22:12.118 --> 22:15.660
You know, Poke, guys in black pajamas
did all right in Vietnam too.

22:16.277 --> 22:17.649
You gotta respect the pajamas.

22:17.979 --> 22:20.110
From the amount of arty
we{'re} put{	ing} down, {I don't think}we won't have

22:20.322 --> 22:22.157
as much to worry
about when we go through.

22:22.277 --> 22:25.047
- What's the population here?
- I've heard 400,000.

22:27.644 --> 22:29.327
Scratch a few off that number.

22:30.501 --> 22:32.306
Gunny and I {re }go{ing} over
to Godfather's position,

22:32.426 --> 22:34.635
see what's coming down to the captain.

22:39.602 --> 22:41.701
What about James Alvarez Trombley?

22:41.870 --> 22:43.501
- That's stupid.
- You're stupid!

22:43.621 --> 22:45.009
Change of personnel.

22:45.569 --> 22:47.595
Gabe, you're swapping with Hasser.

22:47.807 --> 22:49.838
You've got more experience
on the fifty cal.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.813
- It's fine with me.
- Hasser!

22:52.699 --> 22:54.335
I'm trading you for a Mexican.

22:54.455 --> 22:56.877
- You're in Brad's truck now.
- Good to go.

22:57.965 --> 22:59.089
Hey, Gabe!

23:00.362 --> 23:04.353
{Do }You've{ have} the photograph of my girlfriend,
I was showing to Person the other day?

23:07.196 --> 23:09.325
- I think I gave it to Leon.
- Leon?

23:09.697 --> 23:12.662
You let these plebeians look at
a photograph of your girlfriend?

23:14.833 --> 23:15.749
Hey, Walt,

23:16.425 --> 23:19.404
you keep it down?
I{'m} have{ing} trouble hearing the artillery.

23:21.904 --> 23:24.116
...then we have
to play the game harder.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.383
Godfather said that.

23:26.147 --> 23:28.845
Was the Colonel any more specific
about our orders than that?

23:28.965 --> 23:30.242
Godfather told us

23:30.412 --> 23:33.944
the mustache-growing contest
had nothing to do with building morale.

23:34.429 --> 23:35.759
Before the war began,

23:35.879 --> 23:38.647
Division G2 had covert asset intel

23:38.906 --> 23:41.107
that Iraqis planned
to infiltrate our units.

23:41.888 --> 23:44.069
The mustaches were part
of the General's plan

23:44.280 --> 23:46.112
to uncover enemy infiltrators.

23:47.076 --> 23:49.950
So if you see a Marine
with a mustache from now on,

23:50.756 --> 23:52.202
he might be an Iraqi.

23:54.192 --> 23:55.890
So no more mustaches.

23:57.761 --> 24:00.070
But the men don't have to shave tonight.

24:02.989 --> 24:03.992
Oh, yeah.

24:04.245 --> 24:06.609
Bravo's on point
when we roll through Nasiriyah

24:06.729 --> 24:08.762
and then break from the main force.

24:10.136 --> 24:11.140
On point?

24:13.472 --> 24:15.141
In broken-down unarmored Humvees.

24:16.831 --> 24:19.800
They should change our name
to first suicide battalion.

24:24.157 --> 24:26.119
We need to make sure
the stupidity in this company

24:26.239 --> 24:28.486
doesn't roll down too hard on our guys.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.265
What about just James Trombley?

24:32.385 --> 24:33.571
Oh, come on.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.820
Trombley, you should name
your kid Jesus.

24:36.940 --> 24:38.505
I mean, your wife's Mexican.

24:38.625 --> 24:40.695
Fucking Mexicans do it all the time.

24:40.815 --> 24:43.628
That's {what's }cool about knocking up
{ }Mexican girl. She could drop a Jesus.

24:44.227 --> 24:45.437
Never have kids.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.290
In fact, Trombley,

24:48.871 --> 24:50.957
you should never have gotten married.

24:51.077 --> 24:54.786
Women will always cost, but marriage
is the most expensive way to go.

24:56.853 --> 24:58.489
If you want to pay for it,

24:58.882 --> 24:59.978
go to Australia.

25:01.239 --> 25:04.281
For a hundred bucks you can order
a whore over the phone.

25:04.538 --> 25:07.107
Half an hour later
she arrives at your door...

25:07.606 --> 25:09.335
Fresh and hot, like a pizza.

25:12.408 --> 25:14.302
2000 hours Zulu time we go in.

25:14.632 --> 25:16.546
Hitman Two is leading the battalion.

25:16.666 --> 25:18.820
Your vehicle is on point for all of us. {- Yes, sir. }

25:18.940 --> 25:22.151
Once we cross the Euphrates,
expect contact from both sides.

25:22.712 --> 25:24.335
Task force Tarawa Amtracs...

25:25.226 --> 25:26.867
Looks like a C.A.T. team,

25:27.329 --> 25:28.715
straight-leg grunt platoon.

25:29.017 --> 25:30.888
Gotta be careful
about blue-on-blue contact.

25:31.008 --> 25:34.316
Any potential targets we see
within 300 meters of our position,

25:34.724 --> 25:36.405
double-check {	o make sure}if they're not friendly.

25:36.525 --> 25:38.749
What time local is 2000 Zulu?

25:39.103 --> 25:40.434
2300 hours. It'll be dark...

25:40.554 --> 25:42.104
It's to our advantage.

25:42.481 --> 25:43.513
True, sir...

25:43.633 --> 25:45.864
If we had {enough }batteries
to power our night optics.

25:45.984 --> 25:47.853
Turn everything on when we move.

25:47.973 --> 25:51.057
I'm just glad they had the wisdom
to push us through at night.

25:51.177 --> 25:54.335
I'm assured that we will be crossing
that bridge before dawn.

25:54.455 --> 25:55.870
I'm assured of this.

26:01.951 --> 26:04.037
<i>Be advised we're gonna see
friendlies on our right</i>

26:04.157 --> 26:05.752
<i>immediately after the bridge.</i>

26:06.369 --> 26:08.178
<i>Hitman Two, this is Two One Bravo.</i>

26:08.298 --> 26:11.189
<i>Be advised we have friendlies
on both sides. How copy? Over.</i>

26:11.309 --> 26:14.344
Sergeant, I thought they were gonna
send us over the bridge in the darkness.

26:15.191 --> 26:16.596
Not retarded enough.

26:18.424 --> 26:20.228
Careful with the ripped fuel.

26:20.432 --> 26:22.715
Fuck, man. I'm on 30 hours, no sleep.

26:22.885 --> 26:26.108
Beat the record in high school
when I was on the debate team.

26:26.976 --> 26:29.150
Wait a minute...
You were on the debate team?

26:29.270 --> 26:31.690
- What channels for the 119?
- Six, Four and T.A.D.- Seven.

26:31.810 --> 26:33.739
I was really {eally fucking }good, but all {	he other }guys on team

26:33.859 --> 26:36.241
- thought I was high all of the time.
- Shut up, Ray.

26:36.890 --> 26:37.918
All right,

26:38.636 --> 26:40.106
let's make some money.

26:52.405 --> 26:55.005
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Hitman Two One.</i>

26:55.260 --> 26:56.343
<i>Be advised...</i>

26:56.555 --> 26:58.753
<i>we have elements of task force Tarawa

27:01.225 --> 27:02.655
<i>Two One Bravo, copy.</i>

27:03.100 --> 27:04.401
<i>Two Two, across?</i>

27:23.042 --> 27:23.888
Shit!

27:24.287 --> 27:25.957
Fucking tranny fluid from the Amtrac.

27:26.449 --> 27:27.492
Jesus, Brad!

27:28.018 --> 27:29.268
Watch the road.

27:39.149 --> 27:40.221
It's nothing{, Trombley}.

27:51.265 --> 27:52.734
<i>This is Hitman Two Three.</i>

27:52.946 --> 27:54.069
Fucking Baptista.

27:56.003 --> 27:57.615
<i>How copy? How copy?</i>

27:57.909 --> 28:01.369
I don't copy, Hitman Two Three.
I don't copy a word you're saying.

28:02.961 --> 28:06.209
Every time Baptista gets excited,
his english goes out the fucking window.

28:06.329 --> 28:07.869
And he's not even a citizen.

28:07.989 --> 28:10.835
He snuck in from whatever
fucking greaseball country he's from

28:10.955 --> 28:12.089
and now he's a Marine?

28:12.209 --> 28:14.646
You know, there oughta be
some sort of grammar test

28:14.766 --> 28:17.300
before you're out here
blowin' shit up with heavy weapons.

28:17.630 --> 28:18.627
If they did that,

28:18.747 --> 28:21.722
fucking bucktooth, cross-eyed,
sister-fucking hicks like you

28:21.842 --> 28:23.375
wouldn't get in either.

28:25.819 --> 28:27.717
I've got friendlies to my three.

28:28.273 --> 28:29.773
I got them on my nine.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.535
<i>Hitman Two Victors, Hitman Two Victors,</i>

<i>- How copy?

28:59.619 --> 29:00.488
Fuck!

29:01.255 --> 29:03.466
All the bad guys are opening up
on the guys behind us.

29:03.586 --> 29:05.181
Why aren't they shooting at us?

29:08.213 --> 29:09.619
This is cleared hot.

29:12.025 --> 29:13.815
- They got some, didn't they{, Brah}?
- Fuck yeah!

29:14.027 --> 29:16.261
- You caught that, right?
- Most definitely.

29:16.381 --> 29:19.308
Yo, CNN would definitely pay
for drama like that, Brah.

29:19.428 --> 29:21.022
That shit was extreme.

29:47.168 --> 29:48.768
<i>All Hitman Victors halt.</i>

29:49.746 --> 29:50.683
Stop here.

<i>Go a little higher,

30:04.355 --> 30:05.823
<i>Three One, solid on our sector.</i>

<i>Hitman, it's Hitman Three.

30:10.124 --> 30:11.915
This is a nice place for an ambush!

30:12.127 --> 30:14.615
- Why the fuck are we stopped?
- Orders.

30:14.785 --> 30:17.253
<i>Raptor's cas-evacing a Marine
from the R.C.T.</i>

30:17.415 --> 30:18.725
Charlie's halting for 5 mins

30:18.845 --> 30:21.675
to help cas-evac
a wounded Marine from R.C.T. One.

30:30.164 --> 30:32.821
<i>This is nuts halting us here.
We're sitting ducks.</i>

30:32.941 --> 30:34.732
<i>This is the last place {	hat }we should be.</i>

30:34.852 --> 30:36.116
I am so sick

30:36.286 --> 30:39.110
of Captain America
spazzing out on our comms.

30:39.961 --> 30:42.047
<i>They could be coming from all sides.</i>

30:43.384 --> 30:45.669
<i>They could be coming from all sides!</i>

30:46.347 --> 30:47.822
Is our platoon commander okay?

30:47.942 --> 30:51.941
We'll be all right if I turn my fifty
to our six and let off a few rounds.

30:52.586 --> 30:54.416
- You guys got that?
- It's fucking ours.

30:54.913 --> 30:56.682
No, it's not... It's an A.K.

30:56.802 --> 30:59.295
Yeah, and it belongs
to our fucking platoon commander.

31:03.355 --> 31:06.220
Hitman Three this is Three Two.
Interrogative:

31:06.513 --> 31:07.846
what are you engaging?

31:14.111 --> 31:17.578
- Sir, why'd you shoot the car?
- Denying the enemy transportation.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.150
This is Hitman Three.

31:19.270 --> 31:21.203
How much longer are
we going to be halted here,

31:21.323 --> 31:24.946
waiting to die in fucking ambush alley?
My men really need to know out.

31:27.895 --> 31:30.036
<i>Godfather, Godfather, this is Raptor.</i>

31:30.330 --> 31:32.287
<i>Cas-evac marine is stabilized.</i>

31:32.457 --> 31:34.270
<i>We're Oscar Mike. Over.</i>

31:34.533 --> 31:36.442
<i>All Hitman Victors, this is Hitman.</i>

31:36.562 --> 31:38.306
<i>The battalion is Oscar Mike.</i>

32:15.212 --> 32:17.262
Sergeant, I didn't get to shoot.

32:18.390 --> 32:20.293
That fucking sucks, Trombley.

32:20.700 --> 32:23.171
Your recruiting officer
tell you you get to shoot people?

32:23.341 --> 32:24.634
Fucking-a he did. {- See,}

32:24.804 --> 32:28.090
- Trombley asked about shooting people.
- I asked about pussy.

32:28.260 --> 32:31.556
The guy told me I'd get to go
to Thailand, get all kinds of strange.

32:31.676 --> 32:33.139
What'd you ask about, Brad?

32:34.163 --> 32:36.110
Brad probably saw that tv commercial.

32:36.230 --> 32:39.723
The one with the knight who fucks up
the dragon then turns into the Marine.

32:39.843 --> 32:41.693
Dress blues with the sword.

32:42.231 --> 32:44.092
That fucking dress-blues
commercial, man,

32:44.212 --> 32:46.196
that got so many fucking guys.

32:46.811 --> 32:48.061
Now look at us!

32:48.240 --> 32:49.908
Trombley hasn't killed anybody,

32:50.028 --> 32:52.702
I am half a world away
from good thai pussy

32:52.996 --> 32:55.930
and Colbert is out here
rolling around Fuckbutt, Iraq,

32:56.100 --> 32:58.126
hunting for dragons
in a M.O.P. suit that

32:58.246 --> 33:00.291
smells like four days
of piss and ballsweat.

33:03.467 --> 33:04.467
Nice!

33:05.650 --> 33:07.973
You should have rolled
into battle with a sword, Brad.

33:08.093 --> 33:10.143
That would have fucking rocked.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.848
Orders are to push north along route 7

33:15.095 --> 33:17.169
until we get to a cut-off here.

33:18.456 --> 33:20.938
Gentlemen, our A-O is now Mesopotamia.

33:21.273 --> 33:22.876
The land between the Euphrates

33:22.996 --> 33:24.024
and the Tigris,

33:24.249 --> 33:25.895
cradle of civilization.

33:26.065 --> 33:29.446
The Marines ahead of us sure
civilized these motherfuckers.

33:30.295 --> 33:32.410
Second L.A.R.
was out here alone last night,

33:32.530 --> 33:35.202
pushed through Nasiriyah ahead of us,
set up here.

33:35.322 --> 33:37.096
R.P.G. teams came at them all night,

33:37.216 --> 33:39.765
they cut them down
with their bushmasters.

33:40.016 --> 33:41.750
Mad respect for the L.A.V, Sir.

33:42.815 --> 33:46.084
Don't get too comfortable.
We're losing them after 10 kliks.

33:46.314 --> 33:48.006
Cutting off the highway here,

33:48.256 --> 33:50.468
separating from the main element.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.304
And once we leave the hardball here,

33:54.121 --> 33:56.891
Godfather has us pushing through
a canal area

33:57.367 --> 33:58.913
rolling on our own.

33:59.354 --> 34:01.050
Team Two, rally up!

34:01.220 --> 34:02.151
Shady.

34:05.660 --> 34:08.234
I wanted to apologize for
blowing my stack on comms back there.

34:08.730 --> 34:10.447
Ah, I think to myself,

34:10.790 --> 34:12.440
"Why is Iceman so angry?"

34:12.658 --> 34:14.849
Someone pees in his corn flakes
this morning?

34:14.969 --> 34:16.743
Shit, I'm not being critical of you,

34:17.052 --> 34:19.579
but sometimes when you get excited,
you speak spanish on the comm.

34:20.753 --> 34:22.268
This is strange...

34:22.699 --> 34:24.087
because in Brazil,

34:24.257 --> 34:25.241
my country,

34:25.466 --> 34:26.916
we speak portuguese.

34:28.406 --> 34:31.257
Yeah, well whatever language
you people speak down there,

34:31.860 --> 34:34.636
try to stick to english
when we're on Marine corps comms.

34:34.848 --> 34:36.322
<i>Si, Colbert, si.</i>

34:38.485 --> 34:42.464
...25 mm Bushmaster, put a round
through the same hole at 2,000 meters.

34:42.777 --> 34:45.101
Yeah, man, they actually had
to make the gun less accurate.

34:45.221 --> 34:47.098
Still railing on the white man?

34:47.367 --> 34:50.360
I don't hate the white man no more.
Leave that to these motherfuckers.

34:51.210 --> 34:52.070
Me?

34:52.364 --> 34:54.533
I'm just staying here in Iraq,
eating my pound cake,

34:54.652 --> 34:56.523
playing on a white man's team.

34:56.693 --> 34:59.143
Not the surrendering Iraqis we've seen.

34:59.557 --> 35:01.307
These guys came to fight.

35:01.974 --> 35:04.624
Motherfucker died trying
to get a round off.

35:05.029 --> 35:06.334
Combat discipline.

35:08.158 --> 35:11.972
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
observe everything, admire nothing.</i>

35:15.399 --> 35:17.930
Man, I am so high from not sleeping.

35:20.390 --> 35:21.740
So check this out:

35:21.977 --> 35:24.739
maybe they didn't issue the wrong
color fatigues for the invasion.

35:24.859 --> 35:26.537
Maybe our blouses actually aren't green.

35:26.773 --> 35:28.499
Maybe they are desert beige.

35:28.619 --> 35:30.775
You know like sometimes colors actually

35:30.987 --> 35:33.376
start to look different
when you're so sleep-deprived?

35:33.496 --> 35:36.072
Like the sun,
it looks red when it actually is yellow.

35:36.351 --> 35:38.544
You know,
maybe our blouses aren't green.

35:38.664 --> 35:42.663
We're just so fucking sleep-deprived
that's the way that they look to us.

35:44.279 --> 35:47.437
- Are you making this up?
- Fuck yeah, I'm making this up.

35:47.607 --> 35:49.457
It passes the time, brother.

35:56.096 --> 35:57.954
Get some! Look at that truck.

35:59.929 --> 36:01.074
B.M.-21,

36:02.324 --> 36:03.559
a legit target.

36:07.193 --> 36:09.235
It's like a Halloween funhouse.

36:19.029 --> 36:20.241
Stay frosty.

36:27.103 --> 36:30.044
Two One Bravo,
two men in that car to our three.

36:31.291 --> 36:32.741
Do you see weapons?

36:33.142 --> 36:36.092
Two One Alpha, this is Two One Bravo.
No weapons.

36:36.476 --> 36:38.626
These guys are down for the count.

36:44.996 --> 36:46.112
She's dead.

36:46.546 --> 36:47.926
Nothing we can do.

36:51.490 --> 36:53.609
Who's the sicko in our Humvee now?

36:53.979 --> 36:55.861
The psycho-ass jarheads,

36:56.156 --> 36:59.971
or the fucking liberal media just
looking for a little exploitation?

37:01.036 --> 37:02.882
Brah, get that dude right there.

37:03.002 --> 37:04.237
It's not a dude.

37:07.648 --> 37:09.552
Christopher, man, turn it off.

37:10.879 --> 37:12.423
Turn the camera off, Brah.

37:12.543 --> 37:14.293
So it's a snuff film now?

37:21.481 --> 37:23.131
I'm seeing what you see.

37:23.748 --> 37:25.979
You and doc take Christeson and Stafford
off my truck.

37:26.099 --> 37:27.424
They need some experience.

37:27.544 --> 37:28.794
Roger that, sir.

37:29.604 --> 37:31.454
Hitman, this is Hitman Two.

37:31.808 --> 37:34.362
We have what looks
like an enemy encampment.

37:35.328 --> 37:37.429
This is Hitman actual on your six.

37:37.599 --> 37:40.491
L.A.R. taught these hajis
a lesson they won't forget.

37:41.291 --> 37:44.075
Girl with the chopped off
legs is sure gonna remember.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.274
The hell is your problem?

37:47.544 --> 37:51.181
Last night my best team could
only maintain night optics at 50%.

37:51.351 --> 37:53.487
You are not supplying
us with the batteries we need.

37:53.607 --> 37:55.211
You've got more optics and thermals

37:55.423 --> 37:57.797
on that vest
than I've got in the whole platoon.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.791
{And I bet }You've got the batteries to run them{ all night long}.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.561
You're way out of line.

38:02.888 --> 38:04.345
These are for Bravo's command.

38:06.268 --> 38:08.468
The men need to conserve resources.

38:08.812 --> 38:10.351
The marine corps teaches that.

38:41.593 --> 38:44.212
P.F.C. fucknuts,
this is an enemy encampment.

38:44.382 --> 38:46.366
Yo, man, it might be booby-trapped.

38:46.486 --> 38:47.615
Don't blaze a trail.

38:47.735 --> 38:50.085
Tread in Sergeant Colbert's footsteps.

39:11.321 --> 39:12.997
"Say hello to my little friend. "

39:15.287 --> 39:17.137
What the fuck are you doing?

39:17.551 --> 39:18.712
Denying the enemy.

39:21.570 --> 39:23.591
We could have took that for our own.

39:24.453 --> 39:25.576
Haji rice?

39:26.561 --> 39:28.221
These men living here on rice and beans,

39:28.513 --> 39:32.422
sleeping out here in the cold on these
rags, these are some fucking hard men.

39:32.591 --> 39:35.979
You ladies bitch if you get an M.R.E.
without a fucking pop-tart.

39:47.815 --> 39:49.002
Movement right!

39:51.178 --> 39:52.245
Nine o'clock!

40:00.274 --> 40:02.080
Republican Guard insignia.

40:02.681 --> 40:04.331
Special Saddam division.

40:05.113 --> 40:06.372
Bravo Three's commander...

40:06.492 --> 40:08.678
- Should I shoot him?
- Don't waste your bullet.

40:14.991 --> 40:16.936
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Hitman Two.</i>

40:17.056 --> 40:20.760
<i>Be advised the report of an
enemy gas attack was again in error.</i>

40:20.930 --> 40:21.930
<i>Break.</i>

40:22.368 --> 40:24.435
<i>All Hitman teams return
to M.O.P.-2 posture.</i>

40:24.555 --> 40:26.572
<i>- Over.
- Two One Alpha, copy.</i>

40:44.707 --> 40:46.342
This is plain undignified.

40:49.913 --> 40:52.270
Hello, everyone. I'm Michael Jackson.

40:52.993 --> 40:54.743
This is fucking miserable.

40:54.929 --> 40:58.103
Yeah but we get to invade
a whole fucking country, dude.

40:58.398 --> 41:01.340
At this point,
I almost wish Saddam would gas us.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.999
It would make all the effort
with our M.O.P.P. suits worth it.

41:04.119 --> 41:05.812
It would justify the invasion.

41:05.932 --> 41:08.198
There's no doubt Saddam's got chemicals.

41:08.368 --> 41:12.033
It's just you liberal dicksucks
who try to pick everything apart.

41:20.844 --> 41:22.546
<i>- Foot-mobiles, two o'clock.
- Hitman,</i>

41:22.666 --> 41:25.004
<i>- this is Hitman Three Two.
- Maybe 900 meters out.</i>

41:25.307 --> 41:27.684
<i>Took a few rounds from that gas station.
We're pushing through.</i>

41:27.804 --> 41:29.408
Bravo Three's behind us, right?

41:29.528 --> 41:31.235
They're taking fire from
that gas station

41:31.355 --> 41:32.867
- we passed?
- Slow down.

41:32.987 --> 41:33.973
I guess.

41:34.267 --> 41:36.683
<i>- This is Hitman Two. Roger that.
- Is that an R.P.G. tube?</i>

41:40.814 --> 41:42.267
Hitman Two, this is Two One.

41:42.387 --> 41:44.815
We got two foot-mobiles
on our two o'clock,

41:44.985 --> 41:47.188
900 meters out in black.

41:47.497 --> 41:50.364
They appear to be carrying
an R.P.G. tube. How copy?

41:50.911 --> 41:54.382
<i>- Hitman Two One, wait, One. Over.
- Walt, do you see 'em?</i>

41:54.737 --> 41:57.112
- Fucking popped down.
- I see 'em. Down that ditch.

41:57.232 --> 41:59.294
<i>Two One, go ahead
and halt your vehicle. Over.</i>

41:59.414 --> 42:01.375
Person, halt the vehicle.

42:01.670 --> 42:03.490
<i>Hitman actual, this is Hitman Two.</i>

42:03.610 --> 42:05.764
<i>We're halting
to engage possible foot-mobiles.</i>

42:05.884 --> 42:06.963
<i>How copy? Over.</i>

42:07.963 --> 42:10.009
<i>This is Hitman. Solid copy.</i>

42:10.178 --> 42:11.991
<i>All Hitman Victors, be advised</i>

42:12.111 --> 42:14.429
<i>- Raptor is now actively engaged...
- Flashing.</i>

42:15.516 --> 42:17.015
They got optics on us.

42:17.310 --> 42:19.986
<i>Hitman, this is Hitman Two three.
Interrogative:</i>

42:20.156 --> 42:22.759
<i>was that the same gas station
that engaged Three Two? Over.</i>

42:22.879 --> 42:24.607
One keeps popping his head up.

42:24.727 --> 42:26.440
<i>Unknown at this time. Over.</i>

42:26.610 --> 42:29.250
I'm not 100% confident
that was an R.P.G. tube.

42:29.779 --> 42:32.030
But I'm sure
they're putting optics on us.

42:35.311 --> 42:36.338
Pappy,

42:36.508 --> 42:38.945
Reyes, get the M-40
and punch out to that berm.

42:39.065 --> 42:40.279
<i>Two Two, Roger.</i>

42:46.981 --> 42:48.649
Hitman, this is Hitman Two.

42:48.769 --> 42:49.877
Be advised

42:50.144 --> 42:52.184
enemy foot-mobiles to our east

42:52.354 --> 42:55.595
have optics on us and appear to be armed
with an R.P.G. Tube. How copy?

42:55.807 --> 42:58.861
<i>Hitman Two, this is Hitman. You are
approved to engage those targets.</i>

42:58.981 --> 42:59.933
<i>Solid copy.</i>

43:00.207 --> 43:03.080
Hitman Two Two Tcho Five Romeo,
this is Hitman Two.

43:03.250 --> 43:05.815
- You are approved to engage.
- Roger that.

43:07.528 --> 43:08.851
Range to target,

43:09.021 --> 43:11.195
niner, seven, niner.

43:16.074 --> 43:19.161
Wind moving from west to east,
quarter value.

43:22.169 --> 43:23.481
On scope.

43:27.458 --> 43:28.753
On target. Fire.

43:32.453 --> 43:34.164
Stand by for second target.

43:34.284 --> 43:37.034
Low crawling, east, five yards.
You got him?

43:38.541 --> 43:39.932
- I tally.
- Fire.

43:43.076 --> 43:44.095
Hit.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.631
Men from that camp we found.

43:49.011 --> 43:52.217
<i>Raptor to Godfather.
The target has been suppressed.</i>

43:53.197 --> 43:55.379
<i>Raptor, this is Godfather. Solid copy.</i>

43:55.499 --> 43:57.449
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Hitman Two.</i>

43:57.925 --> 44:00.244
<i>We have destroyed the R.P.G. Team. Over.</i>

44:01.414 --> 44:03.329
- You all got some?
- How'd it feel to kill?

44:04.211 --> 44:05.686
I don't know, dawg.

44:06.541 --> 44:08.327
Felt fucking good, I guess.

44:08.829 --> 44:10.628
I try to live my life by the tao{, bro}.

44:11.509 --> 44:13.298
I can't always make my own dharma.

44:13.850 --> 44:16.145
I hate them filthy haji fucks.

44:18.481 --> 44:20.032
That's what I love about you, Dawg.

44:20.152 --> 44:21.806
You're so fucking messed up.

44:22.085 --> 44:23.572
That's how I roll.

44:26.611 --> 44:28.585
All right, gents, let's mount up.

44:28.755 --> 44:31.149
<i>Man over. Personnel
inside the gas station.</i>

44:31.361 --> 44:33.161
<i>Still receiving sporadic mortar fire.</i>

44:33.281 --> 44:35.380
Charlie's still taking
fire from that gas station?

44:35.500 --> 44:38.197
<i>- Raptor, this is Godfather.
- Solid copy. Out.</i>

44:41.329 --> 44:43.852
<i>All Hitman Victors,
this is Hitman Three Three.</i>

44:43.972 --> 44:45.038
<i>We're taking...</i>

44:46.751 --> 44:49.496
<i>...about 600 meters.
Cannot observe the shooter...</i>

44:49.616 --> 44:51.050
{Eric, }You fucking see that?

44:51.515 --> 44:53.636
I don't think that guy was armed.

44:54.605 --> 44:56.915
We didn't see what the captain saw.

44:59.005 --> 45:00.220
He's our commander.

45:01.618 --> 45:04.398
<i>All Hitman Victors, we are oscar mike.</i>

45:13.384 --> 45:14.635
See that trail?

45:15.456 --> 45:17.028
We're going to the left.

45:17.442 --> 45:19.705
The whole rest of the division
is going the other way.

45:19.825 --> 45:20.775
Just us?

45:20.945 --> 45:22.257
Just first recon.

45:23.108 --> 45:25.753
This has the makings
of a legit fucking mission.

45:25.923 --> 45:27.214
We're screening,

45:27.384 --> 45:30.540
doing a route reconnaissance.
Maybe movement to contact.

45:31.227 --> 45:33.230
We got 15 kliks on our own.

45:33.489 --> 45:36.925
Gonna link up with R.C.T. One
outside the next shithole town.

45:38.822 --> 45:39.969
We got no air.

45:41.427 --> 45:43.468
There's a Shamal storm coming.

45:43.805 --> 45:45.255
Rotary isn't flying.

45:45.864 --> 45:48.420
Great, so we're basically
just like bait for the bad guys.

45:48.540 --> 45:49.353
Yep,

45:49.890 --> 45:52.924
but we'll be the first
americans to roll down this road.

45:53.094 --> 45:54.734
Turn and we're money.

46:02.188 --> 46:06.148
<i>All Hitman Two Victors, hold 35kph,
maintain dispersion.</i>

46:06.592 --> 46:07.954
<i>Roger that. Turning left.</i>

46:08.639 --> 46:09.735
<i>Solid copy.</i>

46:25.379 --> 46:27.129
I smell a goddamn Charms.

46:30.318 --> 46:31.568
Sorry, Sergeant.

46:31.994 --> 46:33.146
I had one left.

46:36.980 --> 46:38.430
You know what sucks?

46:38.947 --> 46:41.085
All those dead bodies we seen today,

46:41.255 --> 46:43.281
and I didn't get to shoot any of them.

46:44.433 --> 46:45.775
I see foot-mobiles.

46:46.256 --> 46:47.702
12 o'clock, 100 meters.

46:50.714 --> 46:51.464
Damn!

47:02.854 --> 47:05.970
They're fucking hotties!
I didn't know hajis could be hotties.

47:06.182 --> 47:08.656
I thought
they were all camel-faced hags.

47:11.174 --> 47:12.924
As-salamu alaykum, ladies.

47:14.951 --> 47:16.065
Damn, homey.

47:16.464 --> 47:18.568
Better than when I was in my band!

47:18.738 --> 47:21.028
'cause they haven't heard you play.

47:22.393 --> 47:24.280
We love you, Americans. We love you!

47:24.683 --> 47:26.778
Thank you! Vote republican.

47:30.284 --> 47:31.834
I love you Americans!

47:33.351 --> 47:36.684
<i>Two One, this is Two. I need you to take
that bridge over the canal ahead.</i>

47:36.804 --> 47:37.702
<i>How copy?</i>

47:41.509 --> 47:43.142
Hitman Two, interrogative:

47:43.312 --> 47:45.235
Am I to understand
you mean the near bridge?

47:45.355 --> 47:47.752
Because I don't think
that's the correct turn.

47:47.872 --> 47:49.717
<i>Direct order from Hitman actual.</i>

47:49.837 --> 47:51.587
<i>He's going off of his map.</i>

47:54.274 --> 47:55.246
Roger that.

47:55.366 --> 47:57.016
They let him have a map?

48:12.944 --> 48:14.894
<i>All Hitman Two Victors, halt.</i>

48:17.930 --> 48:19.734
The fuck are we stopping for?

48:19.904 --> 48:21.454
Brad, what's going on?

48:23.745 --> 48:25.997
<i>Hitman Two One Alpha,
this is Hitman Two Three.</i>

48:26.117 --> 48:27.867
<i>What's going on up there?</i>

48:30.529 --> 48:32.026
Motherfucker.

48:34.470 --> 48:37.271
<i>Hitman Two One, this is Hitman.
Interrogative:</i>

48:37.565 --> 48:39.230
<i>Why have we stopped? Over.</i>

48:39.442 --> 48:41.525
<i>Hitman, this is Hitman Two One.</i>

48:41.820 --> 48:42.944
<i>No more road.</i>

48:46.341 --> 48:47.864
Just figuring out we're lost.

48:48.171 --> 48:50.744
I could have told him that
a half an hour ago.

48:51.217 --> 48:52.952
The whole battalion's
two kliks east of us

48:53.276 --> 48:55.726
on the other side of the Gharraf canal.

48:55.996 --> 48:58.246
We are now to the rear of everybody.

48:59.662 --> 49:01.412
He's our commander, Brad.

49:07.018 --> 49:09.002
<i>Hitman Two, this is Hitman actual.</i>

49:10.222 --> 49:13.014
<i>We're gonna backtrack.
Hitman Three will be on point.</i>

49:13.594 --> 49:16.444
<i>Colbert's team took
a wrong turn at the bridge.</i>

49:34.840 --> 49:36.345
<i>Hitman, this is Hitman Two.</i>

49:36.465 --> 49:39.249
<i>We have multiple unarmed civilians
fleeing the town en masse.</i>

49:40.153 --> 49:42.603
<i>We're gonna stop to question them. Over.</i>

49:42.929 --> 49:44.779
<i>This is Hitman. Roger that.</i>

49:50.584 --> 49:53.805
Villagers say they are grateful
to be liberated by the Americans

49:54.274 --> 49:56.629
and look forward
to working hand-in-hand...

49:56.749 --> 49:59.269
You're lying, Meesh,
and they fucking know it.

50:00.656 --> 50:01.406
Meesh,

50:01.774 --> 50:04.415
cut whatever bullshit
the higher ups have told you to say.

50:04.535 --> 50:05.984
We're all alone out here.

50:06.375 --> 50:08.486
You fuck us, I'll smile killing you.

50:10.166 --> 50:12.825
When they hired me, they told me
to put a little spin on things,

50:12.945 --> 50:14.295
a little psy-ops.

50:14.567 --> 50:16.786
But you're right.
We're in this together.

50:17.844 --> 50:20.398
These dudes are saying
there are some bad dudes up ahead.

50:20.518 --> 50:22.792
They know we're coming,
and they want to hit us.

50:23.172 --> 50:24.627
And they hate America, man.

50:25.335 --> 50:27.547
I say we call in some air,
some Cobras, fuck them up.

50:27.709 --> 50:28.715
There is no air.

50:30.108 --> 50:31.658
The Shamal is coming.

50:39.743 --> 50:42.000
Why do we get the so-called interpreter?

50:42.170 --> 50:44.865
He told me he works
directly for General Mattis.

50:45.035 --> 50:47.025
He told me he worked for the C.I.A.

50:47.237 --> 50:50.940
Back at Mathilda, he told me he could
hook me up with free satellite tv.

50:51.110 --> 50:52.678
<i>Hitman Two, this is Godfather.</i>

50:52.798 --> 50:55.035
<i>I can't raise Hitman Actual,
but be advised,</i>

50:55.155 --> 50:58.126
<i>Raptor and Assassin
are taking heavy fire from the town.</i>

50:58.246 --> 50:59.996
Roger that. Stay frosty.

51:00.456 --> 51:03.056
Two kliks up the road,
Alpha, Charlie and H&S are pinned down,

51:03.176 --> 51:05.846
taking heavy fire from the town.
Looks like another Nasiriyah.

51:05.966 --> 51:09.255
<i>Hitman Two, this is Godfather.
We're gonna try to bypass the town.</i>

51:09.725 --> 51:11.933
Copy.
Battalion's trying to find a way around.

51:12.053 --> 51:13.577
Link up with R.C.T. One.

51:13.697 --> 51:16.296
We hold this position
until instructed further.

51:18.999 --> 51:19.933
Gentlemen,

51:20.145 --> 51:21.935
we're looking at a pretty short ride.

51:22.163 --> 51:24.437
We're gonna link up
with regimental combat team.

51:25.152 --> 51:26.731
After which, we rack out tonight.

51:26.943 --> 51:28.942
- Aren't we going through the town?
- No.

51:29.374 --> 51:31.017
But I didn't get to shoot yet.

51:31.137 --> 51:34.075
Hey, that town stopped a whole regiment
with, like, tanks and shit.

51:34.195 --> 51:35.802
But I didn't even get one... {- Trombley}

51:35.922 --> 51:38.485
If we went through that town,
we'd get smoked.

51:46.804 --> 51:50.152
That was a danger close fire mission
right there. On the money.

51:50.322 --> 51:51.872
Good effect on target.

51:56.164 --> 51:58.375
Assassin, this is Godfather. How copy?

51:58.545 --> 51:59.978
Solid copy, Godfather.

52:00.098 --> 52:02.393
Outstanding fire mission. Stand by.

52:05.031 --> 52:06.980
Listen, this town is just up the road.

52:07.330 --> 52:09.274
I see it's not even named
here on my map.

52:09.698 --> 52:12.193
Frankly, Ferrando doesn't give a fuck
what they call it.

52:12.313 --> 52:14.430
I'm not gonna visit long
or make friends.

52:14.550 --> 52:15.909
We're planning to go through?

52:16.029 --> 52:19.279
Do we have a sit-rep
on enemy forces inside this town?

52:19.584 --> 52:22.112
Enough to stop Colonel Dowdy
and 7,000 R.C.T. Marines.

52:22.232 --> 52:23.724
Enough to stop Colonel Dowdy.

52:23.844 --> 52:27.575
But personally, Godfather doesn't like
being told what to do by the enemy.

52:27.695 --> 52:30.194
I don't like the fact that the enemy
had me sitting in this shithole

52:30.314 --> 52:31.755
for the past couple hours.

52:31.875 --> 52:34.372
I might choose a different hole,
somewhere else.

52:34.492 --> 52:37.135
I plan to find that hole
by going through that town up ahead.

52:38.071 --> 52:39.716
If there's one thing I learned{	hese past days} in Iraq,

52:39.836 --> 52:41.483
there's no shortage of shitholes.

52:41.603 --> 52:43.725
More shitholes in this country
than oil wells.

52:46.780 --> 52:49.865
<i>- Assassin, this is Godfather.
- Roger, Godfather. Standing by.</i>

52:49.985 --> 52:52.143
Assassin,
Godfather thinks you did a shit-hot job

52:52.263 --> 52:54.402
calling in those danger-close fires.

52:54.572 --> 52:57.492
Just like you were shit-hot taking out
those {orward }observers by the Nasiriyah bridge.

52:57.612 --> 52:58.472
Roger that.

52:58.592 --> 53:01.898
I want Assassin on point when we push
through that town. How copy?

53:02.018 --> 53:04.162
{Godfather, }We found
there's an open route round the town.

53:04.374 --> 53:06.172
I want you to step off in five mikes.

53:06.292 --> 53:08.442
<i>Push through that town. How copy?</i>

53:09.464 --> 53:10.392
Honored.

53:11.437 --> 53:13.187
Through the city in five.

53:15.409 --> 53:16.931
$300,000, Trombley.

53:18.208 --> 53:21.758
That's the cost to raise
your average middle-class white kid.

53:22.747 --> 53:24.387
Maybe since your fiancee's Mexican

53:24.507 --> 53:27.865
and you'll have little half-Mexican
babies, you can cut corners,

53:27.985 --> 53:29.517
do it on the cheap.

53:30.377 --> 53:33.775
I bet Sergeant Espera's parents didn't
spend more than a hundred to raise him.

53:35.283 --> 53:37.633
But of course, look how he turned out.

53:38.179 --> 53:39.698
You against marriage, Sergeant?

53:42.127 --> 53:43.377
Brad got dumped.

53:46.372 --> 53:48.522
My sweetheart since junior high...

53:49.427 --> 53:50.377
left me...

53:50.852 --> 53:53.602
and married my best friend
since junior high.

53:54.111 --> 53:55.718
We're all still friends.

53:59.672 --> 54:02.854
They're one of those happy couples that
likes to take pictures of themselves

54:02.974 --> 54:05.724
and hang 'em up all over
their goddamn house.

54:07.849 --> 54:11.486
Sometimes I go over there just to look
at my ex-fiancee doing all the things

54:11.606 --> 54:13.857
I used to do with her
with my best friend.

54:16.823 --> 54:17.973
Surfing and...

54:18.777 --> 54:19.827
jet skiing.

54:22.734 --> 54:24.484
It's nice having friends.

54:28.323 --> 54:29.673
Change of orders.

54:30.106 --> 54:31.541
We're going through the town.

54:31.952 --> 54:34.961
Alpha's already rolling.
We're picking up the rear.

54:36.449 --> 54:37.673
It's just us.

54:37.969 --> 54:39.883
There's no air because of
a Shamal moving in.

54:40.095 --> 54:43.011
We're the last element to roll through.
Nobody stops, nobody gets cut off.

54:44.463 --> 54:46.345
I'm glad you're my team leader.

54:46.515 --> 54:48.273
- Thank you, sir.
- Shit.

55:10.312 --> 55:11.662
We're way behind.

55:12.963 --> 55:14.452
I'm doing the best that I can.

55:14.572 --> 55:17.037
This isn't the 805
above La Jolla, you know?

55:18.389 --> 55:20.239
Bravo Three has a casualty.

55:21.252 --> 55:23.002
Took fire from both sides.

55:23.248 --> 55:25.198
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

55:26.068 --> 55:27.847
Alpha and H&S are through the town.

55:28.215 --> 55:29.182
Roger that.

55:40.243 --> 55:41.263
Gentlemen,

55:41.975 --> 55:44.925
from now on we're gonna have
to earn our stories.

56:15.482 --> 56:17.032
Hold your dispersion.

56:22.644 --> 56:25.954
Hitman Two says Alpha
cleared this town under heavy fire.

56:26.124 --> 56:27.615
No casualties were reported.

56:32.205 --> 56:34.692
Brah, why aren't they shooting at us?

56:47.985 --> 56:49.135
Contact! Run.

56:57.528 --> 56:58.878
Here we go, boys.

57:00.066 --> 57:01.608
What a fucking birthday.

57:02.236 --> 57:03.712
Happy birthday, bitch.

57:03.832 --> 57:05.528
Too bad you get shot in the face.

57:31.878 --> 57:33.306
Second-floor balcony...

57:34.249 --> 57:35.767
Shoot that motherfucker.

57:38.007 --> 57:39.438
Don't leave me here.

57:40.245 --> 57:41.911
- What?
- Don't leave me!

57:43.513 --> 57:45.211
Take that fucking gun out!

57:45.381 --> 57:47.331
- Fuck!
- Hit that building!

57:48.393 --> 57:49.614
Get down! Get down!

57:50.631 --> 57:52.181
Pick up and rain fire.

58:12.577 --> 58:13.827
Go, go, go, go!

58:35.937 --> 58:36.887
Slow down!

58:44.345 --> 58:45.295
God... fuck!

58:53.808 --> 58:55.577
I got one. I got one!

58:56.247 --> 58:57.797
Saw his knee explode.

58:58.287 --> 58:59.809
Fuck, the Mark-19's down!

59:07.371 --> 59:09.235
Hass is down. He caught a wire.

59:19.771 --> 59:21.040
Good, go!

59:21.448 --> 59:23.833
- Is Hasser good? Are we good to go?
- Go, go, go!

59:32.921 --> 59:34.552
All Hitman Victors, radio check.

59:41.400 --> 59:44.176
<i>This is Two One Alpha, up 120 and up.</i>

59:45.067 --> 59:47.189
<i>Two One Bravo is up 700 and up.</i>

59:47.967 --> 59:49.815
<i>Hitman Two, this is Two Two,</i>

59:50.113 --> 59:51.291
<i>up 200 and up.</i>

59:53.127 --> 59:54.531
<i>This is Hitman Two Three,</i>

59:54.743 --> 59:56.263
<i>up 300 and up.</i>

59:59.254 --> 01:00:00.872
We got fucking lit up.

01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:03.748
<i>All Hitman Two Victors,
this is Hitman Two. Roger.</i>

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.220
Man!

01:00:06.121 --> 01:00:08.371
- Everybody is okay, right?
- Yes!

01:00:09.668 --> 01:00:11.015
I fucking got one.

01:00:13.338 --> 01:00:14.488
You all right?

01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:21.498
Fuck yeah, that was awesome!

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.550
Did you see Walt?
He tried to kill himself.

01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:25.320
Thanks to your driving.

01:00:27.711 --> 01:00:30.328
- That was fucking heavy, man.
- Fuck yeah, brother.

01:00:30.448 --> 01:00:33.890
- Who was the casualty in Bravo Three?
- It was Darnold, man.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.110
In the arm.

01:00:36.685 --> 01:00:38.735
Yo, did you see my man Manimal?

01:00:39.358 --> 01:00:41.994
Fucking wall of fire.

01:00:42.163 --> 01:00:44.581
He brought that building down.
He saved our asses.

01:00:44.793 --> 01:00:46.193
Yes, he did, he did!

01:00:46.705 --> 01:00:47.755
Get off me!

01:00:48.426 --> 01:00:49.976
This shit ain't funny.

01:00:52.975 --> 01:00:56.725
If it goes a little different,
we could have all got killed today.

01:00:57.901 --> 01:00:59.551
Don't pet a burning dog.

01:01:00.014 --> 01:01:02.314
We damn sure pet one today, didn't we?

01:01:02.484 --> 01:01:03.184
Yep.

01:01:03.985 --> 01:01:07.050
Grooming standard!

01:01:09.969 --> 01:01:11.492
By first light tomorry,

01:01:11.612 --> 01:01:14.649
I expect all y'all to be clean-shaven.

01:01:15.323 --> 01:01:17.439
After what we've just been through?

01:01:18.104 --> 01:01:20.454
There's a lots can go wrong out here...

01:01:21.554 --> 01:01:22.804
lack of battery,

01:01:23.126 --> 01:01:24.076
cold chow,

01:01:24.868 --> 01:01:26.018
lack of pussy,

01:01:27.471 --> 01:01:31.371
but the one thing these men can
count on is the grooming standard.

01:01:31.541 --> 01:01:33.671
I believe it always ought
to be there for them.

01:01:34.411 --> 01:01:36.779
Sergeant Major, my company commander
informed me last night

01:01:36.899 --> 01:01:39.949
that Godfather said
the men wouldn't have to shave.

01:01:42.016 --> 01:01:43.666
In his infinite wisdom,

01:01:44.994 --> 01:01:46.851
the battalion commander never said that.

01:01:48.967 --> 01:01:51.717
You'd best check with
your company commander.

01:01:57.232 --> 01:02:00.882
The one solid piece of information
he passed and he was wrong.

01:02:04.134 --> 01:02:06.784
Ferrando believes
in the violence of action.

01:02:08.515 --> 01:02:09.465
The enemy,

01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:12.515
he stared us down in Nasiriyah.

01:02:15.096 --> 01:02:17.046
But I wanted to show him today

01:02:17.701 --> 01:02:20.651
That some Americans
won't back down from a fight.

01:02:23.693 --> 01:02:26.443
I can put it in terms
of tactics or strategy.

01:02:27.915 --> 01:02:29.365
I could quote Boyd.

01:02:32.143 --> 01:02:33.793
The simple way to say it

01:02:35.664 --> 01:02:38.214
is that some people
might reasonably fear

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.370
these Iraqis running around
trying to organize ways to kill us.

01:02:43.305 --> 01:02:44.155
I don't.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.545
And not because I'm a particularly

01:02:48.665 --> 01:02:50.215
courageous individual.

01:02:52.616 --> 01:02:54.466
I simply have a bigger fear.

01:02:58.035 --> 01:02:59.666
In my darkest hours,

01:03:01.535 --> 01:03:02.785
I sometimes fear

01:03:03.866 --> 01:03:05.516
that I will do something

01:03:06.439 --> 01:03:08.189
General Mattis won't like.

01:03:12.574 --> 01:03:13.624
Gentlemen...

01:03:17.733 --> 01:03:19.611
I have no such fears tonight.

01:03:35.533 --> 01:03:36.283
Brad.

01:03:38.058 --> 01:03:39.208
Brad, get up.

01:03:39.951 --> 01:03:41.083
We have a mission

01:03:41.203 --> 01:03:42.509
search and rescue.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:49.016
One of the officers
went out to take a shit,

01:03:49.545 --> 01:03:52.795
stepped over the berm
and hasn't been heard from since.

01:03:53.025 --> 01:03:54.075
An officer.

01:03:54.855 --> 01:03:56.205
From H&S company.

01:03:56.885 --> 01:03:59.735
He's probably just lost
in the dark somewhere.

01:04:14.544 --> 01:04:17.294
Fucking officers will be
the death of us yet.
