WEBVTT

00:02.834 --> 00:04.000
WE'RE A FAMILY AGAIN.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.417
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE BETTER NOW.

00:06.417 --> 00:09.125
YOU SHOULD BE LIVING
WITH SOMEONE ELSE,
SOMEONE YOU RESPECT.

00:09.125 --> 00:11.208
AND CLEARLY,
I AM NOT THAT PERSON.

00:11.208 --> 00:12.875
I WANT YOU TO MOVE OUT.

00:12.875 --> 00:15.917
WHAT'S THE SENSE IN TRYING
TO SUPPORT A FAMILY THAT
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE ABOUT?

00:15.917 --> 00:16.875
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
GOOD-BYE, ANDIE.

00:16.875 --> 00:19.208
YOU HAVE
YOUR FATHER NOW.

00:19.208 --> 00:20.792
YOU HAVE A FAMILY
AGAIN.

00:20.792 --> 00:23.166
AND YOU WILL ALWAYS
HAVE ME.

00:23.166 --> 00:24.750
I'M NOT LIKE MOM.
I'M NOT!

00:24.750 --> 00:26.792
I SEE TIM,
AND HE IS HERE.

00:26.792 --> 00:28.333
GO AWAY!

00:28.333 --> 00:30.083
GO AWAY!
YOU'RE NOT REAL!

00:30.083 --> 00:30.291
GO!

00:32.500 --> 00:36.458
I KNOW THAT I'LL NEVER
HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO LEAVE YOU AGAIN.

00:36.458 --> 00:38.667
AND LASLO?

00:38.667 --> 00:40.834
OH, YOU'LL HELP HIM NOW,
RICHARD, WON'T YOU?

00:40.834 --> 00:42.417
YOU'LL SEE
THAT HE GETS OUT.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.708
THEN HE'LL HAVE
HIS WORK,

00:43.708 --> 00:45.458
ALL THAT HE'S
BEEN LIVING FOR.

00:45.458 --> 00:47.542
ALL EXCEPT ONE.

00:47.542 --> 00:50.083
HE WON'T HAVE YOU.

00:50.083 --> 00:51.500
Dawson:
"COMPARE AND CONTRAST

00:51.500 --> 00:53.333
HUMPHREY BOGART'S
CHARACTER ARC IN CASABLANCA

00:53.333 --> 00:55.208
TO ONE IN YOUR OWN LIFE.
USE EXAMPLES."

00:57.875 --> 01:01.708
EXAMPLE ONE.
MISS KENNEDY.

01:01.708 --> 01:03.375
HER CHARACTER STARTS OUT

01:03.375 --> 01:06.000
AS THE SADISTIC
FILM TEACHER/SLASH
FATHER'S NEW GIRLFRIEND

01:06.000 --> 01:07.834
WHO MALICIOUSLY CONJURES
UP A FINALS ASSIGNMENT

01:07.834 --> 01:10.542
FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE
OF SLOWLY TORTURING
HER HELPLESS NEMESIS--

01:10.542 --> 01:13.041
PLAYED BY DAWSON LEERY--
TO DEATH.

01:13.041 --> 01:16.000
AN EXAMPLE OF
A PURELY EVIL CHARACTER

01:16.000 --> 01:19.708
WITH ABSOLUTELY
NO ARC WHATSOEVER.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.875
WHY IS IT WE'RE SO
RIDICULOUSLY INTENT

01:28.875 --> 01:31.583
ON PLEASING THE PEOPLE
WHO DISLIKE US THE MOST?

01:31.583 --> 01:34.250
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE
MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL
OUT OF THIS, DAWSON.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.333
I MEAN, IT'S YOUR
FILM FINAL.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.708
THIS SHOULD BE
A NO-BRAINER FOR YOU.

01:36.708 --> 01:38.667
I KNOW.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.333
WHY DON'T YOU JUST,
I DON'T KNOW...

01:43.333 --> 01:45.917
I-INTERVIEW SOMEBODY?

01:45.917 --> 01:48.834
ON CAMERA.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.458
THAT'S IT. PRESENT
MY FILM FINAL ON CAMERA.

01:50.458 --> 01:53.583
I'M BOUND TO GET
POINTS FOR INGENUITY,
IF NOTHING ELSE, RIGHT?

01:53.583 --> 01:54.250
THERE YOU GO.

01:54.250 --> 01:57.792
SO, JOEY...TALK TO ME.

01:57.792 --> 01:59.125
NO. FORGET IT, DAWSON.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.208
HA HA. AND YOU'VE GONE
THROUGH CHANGES THIS YEAR.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.750
YOU HAVE A CHARACTER ARC.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.291
NO, YOU'VE ALREADY
IMMORTALIZED THE LIKENESS
OF MY CHARACTER ON SCREEN.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.125
WITHOUT MY SIGNED CONSENT,
I MIGHT ADD.

02:08.125 --> 02:08.792
FIND ANOTHER SUCKER--

02:08.792 --> 02:11.917
UH, SUBJECT.

02:11.917 --> 02:14.708
MIND JUST A FEW QUESTIONS?

02:14.708 --> 02:16.333
THE CAMERA LOVES YOU.

02:16.333 --> 02:20.333
OK, DAWSON. BEING
THE OVERLY GENEROUS,

02:20.333 --> 02:22.959
KIND, LOVING, CARING
GIRLFRIEND THAT I AM,

02:22.959 --> 02:24.417
I WILL SAY SOMETHING.

02:24.417 --> 02:24.792
WHAT?

02:24.792 --> 02:26.792
[SIGHS]

02:26.792 --> 02:28.750
GOOD LUCK.

02:32.959 --> 02:33.500
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.458
BYE.

03:43.917 --> 03:45.333
DADDY.

03:45.333 --> 03:48.000
HELLO, ANDIE.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.625
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:50.625 --> 03:52.834
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

03:52.834 --> 03:55.917
FUNNY, UM...I SEEM
TO REMEMBER THAT...

03:55.917 --> 03:57.208
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE.

03:57.208 --> 04:00.125
I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE
A LOT OF THINGS TO WORK OUT.

04:00.125 --> 04:01.500
AND WE WILL.

04:01.500 --> 04:05.750
BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M HERE
BECAUSE I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

04:05.750 --> 04:10.250
I KNOW ABOUT TIM AND
EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S
BEEN GOING ON WITH YOU.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.041
WELL, YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT ME,

04:12.041 --> 04:15.875
BECAUSE I'M FINE.

04:15.875 --> 04:19.625
UH...PACEY AND JACK
WERE HERE, AND...

04:19.625 --> 04:21.291
THEY HELPED ME THROUGH
MY ROUGH WEEKS, SO...

04:21.291 --> 04:24.208
I DON'T REALLY
NEED YOU HERE.

04:24.208 --> 04:26.458
ANDIE...

04:26.458 --> 04:27.917
THIS IS SERIOUS.

04:27.917 --> 04:30.250
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE?

04:30.250 --> 04:32.417
I CALLED HIM.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.917
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO ME?

04:36.917 --> 04:38.750
I'M SORRY.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.291
YOUR BROTHER
WAS CONCERNED, AS AM I.

04:41.291 --> 04:45.417
I HAD NO IDEA
THAT YOUR...SITUATION
WAS THIS EXTREME.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.708
"MY...SITUATION"?

04:47.708 --> 04:50.834
WHAT IS THAT, ANOTHER
VAGUE DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS

04:50.834 --> 04:53.208
SO THAT YOU
CAN DEAL WITH IT?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.041
WHEN WE GET HOME,
WE'LL DISCUSS ALL THIS.

04:57.041 --> 04:58.458
YOU SHOULD START
PACKING.

04:58.458 --> 04:59.625
PACKING?!

04:59.625 --> 05:01.375
YOU DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT LEAVING.

05:01.375 --> 05:03.291
IT'S A DECISION
I'VE COME TO.

05:03.291 --> 05:04.291
OHH!

05:04.291 --> 05:06.875
N-N...I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR DECISION!

05:06.875 --> 05:07.792
WE HAVE FINALS.
WE CAN'T LEAVE.

05:07.792 --> 05:09.166
JACK WILL STAY
ONE MORE WEEK.

05:09.166 --> 05:11.750
AS FOR YOU, I'LL CALL
THE SCHOOL AND ARRANGE
FOR MAKE-UPS.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.333
NO! YOU CAN'T TAKE ME AWAY!
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU!

05:14.333 --> 05:18.291
YOU NEED PERPETUAL
SUPERVISION RIGHT NOW.

05:18.291 --> 05:19.250
YOUR MOTHER DOES, TOO.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.417
I'VE SPOKEN TO
YOUR CURRENT DOCTOR

05:21.417 --> 05:21.583
ABOUT OUR OPTIONS.

05:24.417 --> 05:25.125
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

05:25.125 --> 05:29.000
SO WE HAVE NO CHOICE?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.583
ANDIE...I'M NOT ASKING.

05:33.291 --> 05:37.083
I'M SORRY.
I'M--I DIDN'T KNOW.

05:44.583 --> 05:47.375
Jen: WHAT IN THE WORLD
AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

05:47.375 --> 05:49.125
YOU JUST TALK ABOUT
SOME OF THE CHANGES

05:49.125 --> 05:50.667
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH
IN THE PAST YEAR.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.500
OH, GOD, WHAT IS THIS,
AMERICA'S MOST HIDEOUS
VIDEO MOMENTS?

05:53.500 --> 05:54.959
JEN, COME ON.

05:54.959 --> 05:56.542
LET ME GUESS.
CANDID CAMERA.

05:56.542 --> 05:57.792
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.917
OH. OH, WELL,
IF YOU'RE SERIOUS,

05:59.917 --> 06:03.291
THEN BY ALL MEANS,
LET ME REVEAL
MY DEEPEST, DARKEST,

06:03.291 --> 06:05.917
MOST INTIMATE SECRETS
OF THE PAST YEAR FOR YOUR
HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

06:05.917 --> 06:07.333
OH, COME ON.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.917
IF THIS IS
AT ALL OFFENSIVE,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

06:08.917 --> 06:11.667
NO...NO, I...

06:11.667 --> 06:15.250
NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S PROBABLY
A GOOD THING. UM...

06:16.125 --> 06:18.375
I SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT,
SO...

06:19.291 --> 06:21.708
I GUESS IT ALL BEGAN
THAT DAY, UM...

06:21.708 --> 06:24.000
I MEAN, HOW AM I EVER
GONNA BE ABLE TO FORGET

06:24.000 --> 06:28.041
THAT ALL THIS DRAMA
BEGAN TO UNFOLD. I, UH...

06:28.041 --> 06:31.458
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I JUST...

06:31.458 --> 06:33.375
I JUST DID IT.

06:33.375 --> 06:34.708
DID WHAT?

06:34.708 --> 06:35.208
CUT IT OFF.

06:35.208 --> 06:35.917
CUT WHAT OFF?

06:35.917 --> 06:38.750
MY HAIR.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.875
JEN...

06:40.875 --> 06:42.375
OH, I'M SERIOUS, DAWSON.

06:42.375 --> 06:45.375
MAKING A MAJOR HAIRSTYLE
CHANGE LIKE THAT IS
A VERY TRAUMATIC EVENT

06:45.375 --> 06:47.125
IN A YOUNG GIRL'S LIFE.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.000
AH, DAWSON, ANY
OTHER DAY BUT TODAY,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.625
I'D BE GLAD TO TELL YOU
ABOUT MY WELL-PUBLICIZED
LIFE CHANGES,

06:53.625 --> 06:56.500
BUT, UH, TODAY'S
KIND OF A DISASTER.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.250
I'M SORRY, MAN.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.417
OH, YEAH.
IT'S NO PROBLEM.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
THANK YOU.

07:04.000 --> 07:04.792
NO.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.291
COME ON, JOEY,
I'M DESPERATE.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.917
NO!
WHY NOT?

07:07.917 --> 07:10.000
LOOK, STALKER PAPARAZZI
IS NOT A FLATTERING
OCCUPATION, DAWSON.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.583
GIVE IT UP.

07:18.291 --> 07:19.583
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT HOW PEOPLE
GROW AND CHANGE.

07:19.583 --> 07:23.041
WELL, FOR JUST 3 EASY
PAYMENTS OF 29.95,

07:23.041 --> 07:25.667
YOU, TOO, CAN GO
FROM TOWN PARIAH
TO FINE, UPSTANDING CITIZEN

07:25.667 --> 07:27.291
IN JUST 6 MONTHS.

07:27.291 --> 07:29.125
HERE?

07:29.125 --> 07:30.375
SURE.

07:31.417 --> 07:34.458
SO, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,
I MEAN...

07:34.458 --> 07:36.291
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

07:36.291 --> 07:39.250
I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING, DAWSON.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.500
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT LEFT TO
MY OWN DEVICES,

07:42.500 --> 07:45.000
I WOULD BE REPEATING
THE TENTH GRADE AT BEST.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.625
AT WORST,
I'D PROBABLY BE
LIVING UNDER A HIGHWAY

07:46.625 --> 07:47.667
SOMEWHERE RIGHT NOW.

07:47.667 --> 07:48.834
[LAUGHS]

07:48.834 --> 07:50.375
GIVE ME A BREAK, PACEY.

07:50.375 --> 07:53.166
I MEAN, Y-YOU HAD SOME
OUTSIDE INSPIRATION,
BUT YOU KNOW,

07:53.166 --> 07:54.333
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GRABBED
YOUR LIFE BY THE BALLS

07:54.333 --> 07:56.375
AND TURNED THINGS AROUND.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.083
DAWSON, MY ONLY
ACCOMPLISHMENT THIS YEAR

07:58.083 --> 08:01.125
WAS TO FIND AN
INSPIRATION LIKE ANDIE.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.250
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
JUST STEMMED FROM HER.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.166
CLASSIC HERO WHO CHANGES
FOR THE LOVE OF A WOMAN.

08:04.166 --> 08:07.291
NOT EXACTLY, BUT...

08:07.291 --> 08:10.125
EVERY DAY I WAKE UP,
I'M HOLDING MY BREATH,

08:10.125 --> 08:12.625
JUST WAITING FOR
SOMEBODY TO EXPOSE
MY FRAUDULENT ACT.

08:12.625 --> 08:15.000
YOU KNOW,
LOCK ME UP FOR IT.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.458
FIGURE OUT THAT
THIS WHOLE THING
WAS JUST A BIG LIE.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.375
WE CAN DO THIS LATER.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.208
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

08:27.208 --> 08:27.667
[SIGHS]

08:31.083 --> 08:34.207
EVER SINCE
ME AND ANDIE...

08:34.207 --> 08:38.082
WELL, I MEAN,
LITERALLY COLLIDED,

08:38.082 --> 08:42.082
SHE MISTOOK ME
FOR SOMEONE ELSE,

08:42.082 --> 08:43.667
AND SHE GAVE ME
SOMEBODY TO BE.

08:43.667 --> 08:44.917
AND NOW THAT
SHE NEEDS MY HELP,

08:44.917 --> 08:48.041
THERE'S NOT A DAMN THING
THAT I CAN DO FOR HER.

08:49.542 --> 08:50.875
I'M FAILING HER, DAWSON.

08:52.917 --> 08:55.875
LISTEN...YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FIND YOURSELF
ANOTHER HERO.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
ANDIE?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.291
OH, PACEY.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.834
ANDIE, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU? YOU WEREN'T
IN CLASS THIS MORNING.

09:04.834 --> 09:08.125
YEAH, UH--UH, MY DAD
CAME BACK INTO TOWN,
AND...

09:08.125 --> 09:09.166
HE'S GONNA MAKE US
GO HOME.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.041
HE'S TAKING US BACK
TO PROVIDENCE.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.750
WHAT?

09:14.542 --> 09:16.834
OK, ALL RIGHT, UM...
COME ON.

09:24.458 --> 09:28.458
GOD, HE WANTS ME
TO GET HELP, OK?

09:28.458 --> 09:30.250
HE WANTS US
TO BE A FAMILY AGAIN,

09:30.250 --> 09:32.542
BUT HE'S BEEN ABSENT
FOR OVER A YEAR, PACEY.

09:32.542 --> 09:35.375
AND NOW THAT I'M FINALLY
STARTING TO MAKE A LIFE
FOR MYSELF HERE,

09:35.375 --> 09:36.917
HE JUST WANTS
TO WRENCH ME AWAY.

09:36.917 --> 09:39.333
OH, GOD, I JUST--OHHH...

09:39.333 --> 09:40.500
HE MAKES ME SO ANGRY!

09:40.500 --> 09:43.625
OK, LISTEN, CAN'T HE JUST
GET YOU YOUR HELP HERE?

09:43.625 --> 09:46.542
YOU ALREADY HAVE
A THERAPIST IN TOWN, SO...

09:46.542 --> 09:49.583
NO, PACEY.
HE'S THE MOST STUBBORN
MAN IN THE WORLD.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.083
IF HE EVEN THINKS
THAT I SHOULD LEAVE,

09:51.083 --> 09:52.458
THEN I MAY AS WELL
START PACKING.

09:52.458 --> 09:54.333
ANDIE, WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU WANT TO DO?

09:54.333 --> 09:56.417
WHAT DO I WANT TO DO?
PACEY, I WANT
TO STAY HERE.

09:56.417 --> 10:00.083
GET HELP HERE. I...

10:00.083 --> 10:02.375
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

10:02.375 --> 10:04.500
I--I MEAN, THE THOUGHT
OF US NOT BEING ABLE
TO BE TOGETHER, IT'S--

10:04.500 --> 10:07.583
SO, ANDIE, WE FIGHT
HIM ON THIS.

10:07.583 --> 10:09.291
OK? THIS AIN'T OVER YET.

10:09.291 --> 10:13.542
HE WANTS TO LEAVE
TOMORROW, PACEY.

10:16.375 --> 10:20.875
OK...THAT'S FINE. UH...

10:24.583 --> 10:27.500
THAT'S FINE. ANDIE,
IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.458
BECAUSE WHEN HE HEARS
WHAT WE HAVE TO TELL HIM,

10:29.458 --> 10:31.291
HE'S NOT
TAKING YOU ANYWHERE.

10:45.291 --> 10:47.875
BITE OF MY SUBWAY
FOR YOUR TROUBLES?

10:52.708 --> 10:53.917
MY DAD'S BACK.

10:57.792 --> 10:58.625
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I CALLED HIM.

10:58.625 --> 11:03.291
ANDIE IS NOT DOING WELL,
AND...

11:03.291 --> 11:03.959
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

11:03.959 --> 11:04.792
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.625
NO, I DIDN'T,
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

11:06.625 --> 11:07.917
HE WAS GONNA
STAY AND HELP,

11:07.917 --> 11:09.625
AND INSTEAD,
HE WANTS TO TAKE US
BACK TO PROVIDENCE.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.959
YOU KNOW WHAT, JACK?
THERE'S A BRIGHT SIDE
TO THIS.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.792
MAYBE ANDIE'S
GONNA GET BETTER.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.875
MAYBE IF YOU AND
YOUR DAD MOVE BACK,

11:19.875 --> 11:21.834
THEN THERE'S A CHANCE
FOR RECONCILIATION.

11:21.834 --> 11:24.500
HA HA. YEAH. RIGHT.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.250
US AND THE MIDDLE EAST.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.834
WHAT'S YOUR DEAL
ANYWAY, HUH?

11:32.834 --> 11:35.083
YOU GONNA STAY
AT THE LEERYS' FOREVER?

11:35.083 --> 11:38.125
OH, OUCH! I DON'T KNOW.

11:38.125 --> 11:38.917
THE SITUATION'S
KINDA DIRE.

11:38.917 --> 11:41.792
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR MOM AND DAD?

11:41.792 --> 11:44.542
THEY MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR
HOW THEY FELT ABOUT ME
WHEN THEY SENT ME HERE.

11:44.542 --> 11:46.000
WELL, YOU'RE
DIFFERENT NOW.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.208
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
NOT THE SAME GIRL
THEY SENT AWAY.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.917
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
WITH GRAMS,

11:49.917 --> 11:51.041
THEY'LL NEVER BELIEVE
THAT ANYTHING'S CHANGED.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.250
WELL, GIVE THEM A CHANCE.
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS?

11:53.250 --> 11:54.625
MAYBE...

11:56.166 --> 11:58.208
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE WHO'S CHANGED.

12:02.208 --> 12:03.250
HERE YOU GO.

12:03.250 --> 12:03.750
HEY.

12:03.750 --> 12:06.583
HEY. MMM.

12:07.458 --> 12:08.542
COME HERE.

12:08.542 --> 12:09.917
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

12:09.917 --> 12:11.250
IT'S THE LOUNGE.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.917
MUSIC NIGHTLY
FEATURING EAST COAST'S
FINEST ENTERTAINERS.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.041
HEY, AM I GONNA
NEED A TIE TO GET
IN HERE NOW?

12:15.041 --> 12:18.291
I THINK YOU MAY HAVE
SOME PULL WITH THE OWNER.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.834
THAT IS NOT MY FATHER.

12:19.834 --> 12:23.959
HE'S TURNED INTO THIS
MR. SATURDAY NIGHT SITCOM
FATHER OF THE YEAR.

12:23.959 --> 12:27.166
THE MAN I KNEW WAS
THIS GRUMBLING, DEJECTED
MASS OF NEGATIVITY.

12:27.166 --> 12:28.667
YOU MEAN, A RELATIVE
OF YOURS WAS GRUMBLING
AND NEGATIVE?

12:28.667 --> 12:30.542
I--THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

12:30.542 --> 12:34.250
I'M HAPPY. SO SUE ME.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.583
TRUST ME.
I LOVE THIS NEW...

12:36.583 --> 12:39.125
HAPPY-GO-LUCKY
JOEY POTTER.

12:43.125 --> 12:44.125
I'LL BE BACK.
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

12:44.125 --> 12:46.959
OK.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.417
Mr. Potter: HEY, DAWSON.

12:49.417 --> 12:50.125
HEY.

12:50.125 --> 12:51.750
THIS IS AN OLD FRIEND PETE.

12:51.750 --> 12:52.750
HI. HOW YOU DOIN'?

12:52.750 --> 12:54.250
NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.750
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT OUR DAYS IN THE
MERCHANT MARINES TOGETHER.

12:56.750 --> 13:00.166
NOT EXACTLY
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

13:00.166 --> 13:02.250
I HAVE--I HAVE
A QUESTION. UM...

13:02.250 --> 13:04.000
ACTUALLY,
WHAT I NEED IS A, UH,

13:04.000 --> 13:05.875
A SUBJECT FOR ONE
OF MY FINAL PROJECTS.

13:05.875 --> 13:07.041
I NEED SOMEBODY
IN MY LIFE

13:07.041 --> 13:08.750
WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED
A MAJOR CHARACTER
CHANGE.

13:08.750 --> 13:11.041
IF YOU MEAN ME, I'M--
I'M FLATTERED, DAWSON.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.041
SO YOU WOULDN'T MIND
IF I INTERVIEWED YOU?

13:13.041 --> 13:14.125
NOT AT ALL!

13:14.125 --> 13:15.250
GREAT. GREAT!

13:15.250 --> 13:18.875
IN RETURN, THOUGH, I GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO DO.

13:18.875 --> 13:20.500
OK. SURE.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.291
WHAT DOES THIS DO?

13:30.417 --> 13:32.083
WHAT?

13:34.250 --> 13:36.708
NOTHING.

13:36.708 --> 13:38.083
WHAT?

13:38.083 --> 13:40.000
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

13:44.542 --> 13:46.834
PACEY, FROM THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE,

13:46.834 --> 13:49.000
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
HEARD THE BAD NEWS.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.792
YEAH. SO WHAT'S
THE RUSH, JACK?

13:51.792 --> 13:53.458
I MEAN, WHY NOW?
TOMORROW MORNING?

13:53.458 --> 13:55.625
IT'S MY FAMILY'S FLAIR
FOR HISTRIONICS.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.917
IT WOULDN'T BE A McPHEE
DEPARTURE IF WE WEREN'T
DOING IT IN THE EARLY DAWN

13:57.917 --> 14:00.333
WITH, LIKE,
A FEW HOURS TO PREPARE.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.959
OK, SO HOW DO WE
STOP THIS?

14:01.959 --> 14:03.667
I DON'T THINK WE CAN.

14:03.667 --> 14:06.917
I MEAN, MY FATHER'S DECISIONS,
THEY'RE FINAL. THERE'S
NO POINT IN ARGUING THEM.

14:06.917 --> 14:08.875
I KNOW HOW THAT IS.
OK, BELIEVE ME,
I DO.

14:08.875 --> 14:10.500
BUT NOW IS NOT
THE TIME TO GIVE UP.

14:10.500 --> 14:11.500
THERE'S TOO MUCH
AT STAKE HERE, JACK.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.667
WHICH IS PRECISELY WHY
SHE'S LEAVING NOW.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.750
MR. McPHEE.
I'M PACEY WITTER.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.000
I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU, SON,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.291
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR
VEHEMENCE REGARDING
MY DAUGHTER'S SITUATION,

14:22.291 --> 14:24.500
AS I'M SURE YOU APPRECIATE
MY OWN CONCERN.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.333
I DO, ABSOLUTELY.

14:26.333 --> 14:29.000
I'M JUST WONDERING
WHY YOU'RE MAKING HER
LEAVE NOW LIKE THIS.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.792
BECAUSE HER DOCTORS
IN PROVIDENCE SUGGESTED
THAT WE WASTE NO TIME

14:31.792 --> 14:33.792
GETTING HER
THE PROPER CARE.

14:33.792 --> 14:34.667
OK, SO WHY NOT HERE?

14:34.667 --> 14:37.166
BECAUSE I'M NOT HERE.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.750
BUT SHE
HAS FRIENDS HERE,
A WHOLE SUPPORT SYSTEM.

14:39.750 --> 14:41.708
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THOSE
THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FAMILY?

14:41.708 --> 14:43.166
NO, SIR. I...

14:43.166 --> 14:45.208
I'M JUST SUGGESTING
THAT ANDIE'S BUILT
A FAMILY HERE,

14:45.208 --> 14:47.667
ONE THAT I'M A PART OF,
AND I CAN HELP HER.

14:47.667 --> 14:50.083
SHE IS MY RESPONSIBILITY.

14:53.041 --> 14:54.542
WELL, WITH ALL
DUE RESPECT, SIR,

14:54.542 --> 14:56.875
YOU KNEW OF ANDIE'S
CONDITION WHEN YOU
LEFT HER AND JACK HERE,

14:56.875 --> 14:58.375
SO TO TAKE HER HOME NOW

14:58.375 --> 15:00.208
BECAUSE YOU'VE SUDDENLY
DEVELOPED SOME SORT
OF GUILTY CONSCIENCE

15:00.208 --> 15:01.375
IS NOT FAIR.

15:01.375 --> 15:04.250
IT'S NOT FAIR TO WHOM,
TO MY DAUGHTER
OR TO YOU?

15:04.250 --> 15:07.417
BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST TOO
SELFISH TO LET HER GO.

15:13.792 --> 15:16.375
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.250
I'M NOT JUST HERE
ON ANDIE'S BEHALF,

15:18.250 --> 15:21.583
BECAUSE IF SHE LEFT ME,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO.

15:21.583 --> 15:25.583
SO I GUESS I'M BEGGING YOU
FOR BOTH OF US, SIR.

15:25.583 --> 15:28.417
PLEASE, LET ANDIE STAY.

15:28.417 --> 15:32.125
I'M SORRY.
MY MIND'S MADE UP.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.500
MOM.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.750
HEY, IT'S JENNIFER.

15:53.750 --> 15:57.000
YEAH.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.667
YEAH, UM, I FIGURED THAT
SHE MIGHT HAVE CALLED YOU.

15:59.667 --> 16:03.917
UM, I'M JUST--I'M STAYING
NEXT DOOR WITH THE LEERYS.

16:03.917 --> 16:06.291
UM, THEY'VE BEEN
REALLY GREAT.

16:06.291 --> 16:11.458
NO. NO, THEY DON'T SEEM
TO MIND AT ALL, UM...

16:11.458 --> 16:14.667
ACTUALLY, THAT'S WHAT
I'M CALLING ABOUT, UM...

16:14.667 --> 16:16.458
I WAS WONDERING IF THE...

16:16.458 --> 16:20.333
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S BEEN
A WHILE SINCE WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT THIS,

16:20.333 --> 16:23.792
BUT I WAS JUST...

16:23.792 --> 16:27.834
CURIOUS AS TO WHAT THE
SITUATION IS WITH ME, UM...

16:27.834 --> 16:30.000
COMING HOME...

16:33.208 --> 16:35.083
TO STAY...

16:35.083 --> 16:38.125
WITH YOU AND DAD?

16:45.333 --> 16:46.834
Dawson: OWW!

16:55.041 --> 16:58.750
[TO HIMSELF] OH, GOD,
I SUCK AT THIS.

16:58.750 --> 16:59.750
HEY!

16:59.750 --> 17:00.291
HEY!

17:03.166 --> 17:05.708
YOU KNOW,
I'VE DECIDED THAT, UM,

17:05.708 --> 17:08.000
THIS WHOLE NEW MACHO
WORKING MAN THING...

17:08.000 --> 17:09.791
DEFINITE TURN-ON.

17:09.791 --> 17:11.000
REALLY?

17:11.000 --> 17:12.583
MM-HMM.

17:12.583 --> 17:15.500
I WAS THINKING, HOWEVER,
THAT MAYBE YOU NEED
A MAKEOVER.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.125
YOU KNOW,
THE REBEL LOOK.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.750
TIGHT T-SHIRT,
DENIM LEATHER JACKET.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.375
YOU KNOW,
GREASE THE HAIR BACK.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.750
SURE, I COULD DO THAT.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.541
OK...I'M READY.

17:27.541 --> 17:28.290
ALREADY? OH, OK.

17:28.290 --> 17:31.583
I'LL, UH, FINISH THIS LATER,

17:31.583 --> 17:34.208
AND I'LL GO SET THINGS UP.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.208
THAT'S NOT
GOING TO WORK.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.834
I KNOW.

17:40.834 --> 17:43.917
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

17:45.041 --> 17:47.708
Mr. Potter: I GUESS
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES.

17:47.708 --> 17:50.375
SOME OF US ARE JUST BETTER
AT IT THAN OTHERS.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.500
YEAH, BUT YOU WERE ABLE
TO OVERCOME YOUR MISTAKES.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.708
WELL...

17:54.708 --> 17:57.583
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
I WOULD DIE OF SHAME.

17:57.583 --> 18:00.291
LITERALLY.

18:00.291 --> 18:04.875
I--I JUST, UH, I LOST
EVERYTHING THAT I LOVED.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.583
AS MUCH AS I DIDN'T WANT
TO THINK IT, DAWSON,

18:06.583 --> 18:08.959
DEEP DOWN,
I WAS A WEAK MAN.

18:08.959 --> 18:11.583
IT FELT HOPELESS,
AND--AND...

18:11.583 --> 18:14.250
EVEN IF I COULD
TURN THINGS AROUND,

18:14.250 --> 18:15.417
WOULD MY DAUGHTERS
EVER FORGIVE ME?

18:15.417 --> 18:20.375
COULD THEY EVER FORGET
WHAT I DID TO THEIR MOTHER?

18:20.375 --> 18:21.291
HOW COULD--

18:33.208 --> 18:37.500
THIS'LL BE GOOD
FOR YOUR MOTHER
AND ANDIE AND YOU.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.208
PUT OUR FAMILY
BACK TOGETHER.

18:40.417 --> 18:43.875
WHAT IF, UM...

18:43.875 --> 18:48.583
WHAT IF YOU STAYED?
MOVED HERE WITH US?

18:48.583 --> 18:50.542
I CAN'T LEAVE MY BUSINESS.

18:50.542 --> 18:52.291
THEN START UP
A NEW ONE.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.625
OR MOVE IT HERE,
OR TAKE DAY TRIPS,
I DON'T CARE.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.667
IF YOU REALLY LOVED US,
YOU'D STAY.

18:57.667 --> 19:00.000
THERE'S NO ONE HERE
TO HELP ANDIE.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.417
NO. THERE'S PACEY.

19:01.417 --> 19:05.125
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
2 PEOPLE THAT HAVE
WHAT THEY HAVE TOGETHER.

19:05.125 --> 19:07.125
I CAN ONLY OFFER
WHAT I'VE OFFERED.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.375
YOU HAVEN'T OFFERED
EVERYTHING.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.417
YES, I HAVE.

19:09.417 --> 19:11.792
YOU HAVEN'T OFFERED HER
A CHOICE.

19:11.792 --> 19:12.834
I--I CAN'T DO THAT!

19:12.834 --> 19:16.333
IT'S BEST FOR EVERYONE
IF WE ALL LEAVE, JACK.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.625
YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR
SISTER NEED SERIOUS
MEDICAL ATTENTION.

19:23.625 --> 19:27.583
AND--AND YOU'RE CERTAINLY
NOT GOING TO GET THE HELP
YOU NEED HERE IN CAPESIDE.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.500
HELP? EXACTLY WHAT KIND
OF HELP DO I NEED?

19:30.500 --> 19:33.166
IF YOU COULD TALK TO SOMEONE
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM.

19:33.166 --> 19:36.500
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST
DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.792
JUST--JUST HEAR ME OUT.

19:39.792 --> 19:44.166
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE C-CONFUSED
WITH THESE GAY IDEAS.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.834
THE ONLY PROBLEM
THAT I HAVE

19:46.834 --> 19:49.166
IS THE PROBLEM THAT YOU
HAVE WITH ME BEING GAY.

19:49.166 --> 19:52.208
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME
ANYWAY OR YOU.

19:52.208 --> 19:54.542
IT'S ABOUT ANDIE
AND WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

19:54.542 --> 19:56.125
JUST, GOD, DAD...

19:56.125 --> 19:58.208
L-LET HER
MAKE THE CHOICE.

19:58.208 --> 19:59.750
LET HER
MAKE THE DECISION.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.875
YOU KNOW HOW DAMAGING
IT WOULD BE
TO TAKE HER AWAY NOW?

20:01.875 --> 20:03.583
AWAY FROM PACEY?

20:03.583 --> 20:06.959
I HARDLY THINK A TEEN
ROMANCE IS THE SOLUTION
TO HER MEDICAL PROBLEMS.

20:06.959 --> 20:11.792
HER SOLUTION WILL COME
FROM THE PEOPLE THAT
LOVE AND CARE FOR HER.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.125
I KNOW THAT'S NOT
YOUR SPECIALTY, DAD.

20:27.542 --> 20:31.375
Pacey: OK, THIS
IS RIDICULOUS, ANDIE,

20:31.375 --> 20:33.208
FOR THE TWO OF US
TO BE SITTING HERE

20:33.208 --> 20:35.375
PASSIVELY AWAITING
OUR INEVITABLE DOOM.

20:35.375 --> 20:39.041
YOU COULD USE THIS TIME
TO START STUDYING
FOR YOUR FINALS.

20:39.041 --> 20:41.208
FORGET ABOUT MY FINALS.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.625
I GOT A MUCH BETTER IDEA.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.834
YOU AND I, WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TOMORROW BRINGS,

20:45.834 --> 20:46.583
BUT TONIGHT IS OURS. SO...

20:46.583 --> 20:48.917
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO?

20:48.917 --> 20:52.917
WELL, I'D LIKE TO GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE
IF WE COULD.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.083
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

20:55.083 --> 20:58.708
WELL, ANDIE McPHEE, I WOULD
LIKE TO TAKE YOU ON A DATE,

20:58.708 --> 21:01.875
ONE WHERE I CAN COME OVER
AND PICK YOU UP...

21:01.875 --> 21:03.083
AND TAKE YOU OUT
TO DINNER,

21:03.083 --> 21:05.000
MAYBE A MOVIE...

21:05.000 --> 21:06.417
SOME MOONLIGHT...

21:06.417 --> 21:08.250
A LITTLE ROMANCE.

21:08.250 --> 21:10.750
BELIEVE ME, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU AND I NEED.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.083
PACEY, UH...

21:12.083 --> 21:17.375
IT'S JUST THAT THERE'S
SO MUCH THAT NEEDS
TO BE DONE, AND...

21:17.375 --> 21:19.583
I, UM...

21:19.583 --> 21:20.917
I JUST...

21:20.917 --> 21:23.000
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.083
YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:25.083 --> 21:28.750
A NIGHT OUT ON THE TOWN,
JUST THE TWO OF US...

21:28.750 --> 21:29.375
IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE NEED.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.542
NOW YOU'RE TALKING.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.625
WE'LL DEAL WITH TOMORROW
TOMORROW.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.625
BUT TONIGHT...

21:36.625 --> 21:38.875
TONIGHT WILL BE MAGICAL.

21:38.875 --> 21:41.583
OK.

21:41.583 --> 21:44.166
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

21:44.166 --> 21:45.542
OK.

21:57.708 --> 21:58.792
WHAT DROVE YOU
TO YOUR LOWEST POINT?

21:58.792 --> 22:03.250
UH...

22:03.250 --> 22:06.875
JOEY'S MOM WAS GETTING WORSE.
THE BILLS WERE MOUNTING.

22:06.875 --> 22:09.792
WHY ELSE WOULD SOMEONE
MAKE THE IDIOTIC DECISION

22:09.792 --> 22:12.750
TO RISK EVERYTHING
FOR THE ALMIGHTY BUCK?

22:12.750 --> 22:17.708
I FOUND MYSELF IN WHAT
SEEMED AT THE TIME TO BE
AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION,

22:17.708 --> 22:21.750
SO I BEGAN
TRAFFICKING MARIJUANA.

22:21.750 --> 22:24.917
DAD, DIDN'T YOU PROMISE
BESSIE YOU'D BRING
HER AND ALEXANDER DINNER?

22:24.917 --> 22:27.125
DAWSON, CAN WE
CONTINUE THIS LATER?

22:27.125 --> 22:28.417
YEAH.

22:34.041 --> 22:37.792
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

22:37.792 --> 22:39.708
LOOK, THIS WHOLE
DAWSON LEERY

22:39.708 --> 22:41.500
INVESTIGATIVE-REPORTER-
AT-LARGE THING,

22:41.500 --> 22:42.959
IT'S INTRUSIVE.

22:42.959 --> 22:44.834
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
MY FATHER RELIVE

22:44.834 --> 22:46.500
SUCH AN EXCRUCIATINGLY
PAINFUL TIME IN HIS LIFE?

22:46.500 --> 22:49.000
TH-TH-THAT'S THE HEART
OF THE PIECE, JO.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.875
I'M TRYING TO GET
A COMPLETE PICTURE
OF A MAN

22:50.875 --> 22:53.625
WHO'S CHANGED
SO COMPLETELY
AND SO HEROICALLY.

22:53.625 --> 22:55.834
BUT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND...
I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE IN THE PAST.

22:55.834 --> 23:00.542
WE'VE WORKED SO HARD
TO CLOSE THOSE DOORS
AND MOVE ON...

23:00.542 --> 23:02.291
GOD, JO, I'M SORRY.

23:02.291 --> 23:05.291
IF YOU'RE SO HELL-BENT
ON MAKING THIS ASSIGNMENT
ABOUT SOMETHING REAL,

23:05.291 --> 23:07.542
THEN WHY ARE YOU BASING IT
ON ANOTHER PERSON?

23:07.542 --> 23:09.375
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO
THE OBVIOUS?

23:09.375 --> 23:12.500
TURN THE CAMERA
ON YOURSELF.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.500
WELL...I CAN'T.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.458
WHY NOT?

23:15.458 --> 23:16.750
BECAUSE...
WHY NOT?

23:16.750 --> 23:18.417
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID, OK?

23:19.834 --> 23:20.750
I'M AFRAID THAT
I'M NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU

23:20.750 --> 23:22.417
AND THAT I NEVER
WILL BE, ALL RIGHT?

23:22.417 --> 23:23.834
AND IF I DO THIS,

23:23.834 --> 23:25.041
YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO REALIZE THAT YOU'VE
GROWN WAY BEYOND ME,

23:25.041 --> 23:27.333
AND THEN I'M...

23:28.166 --> 23:29.667
I'M JUST GONNA
LOSE YOU AGAIN.

23:39.083 --> 23:42.500
[KNOCK KNOCK]

23:42.500 --> 23:43.750
HEY.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.125
HEY.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.250
I TALKED TO DAD.

23:52.250 --> 23:53.625
THEN WHY
ARE YOU SMILING?

23:53.625 --> 23:56.959
BECAUSE HE SAID THAT
IF I WANTED TO STAY,

23:56.959 --> 23:58.125
HE'D TRY TO WORK IT OUT.

23:58.125 --> 24:00.875
WOW, THAT'S
GREAT NEWS, THEN,
HUH?

24:00.875 --> 24:02.834
I GUESS.

24:04.792 --> 24:05.875
ANDIE, WELL...

24:05.875 --> 24:08.000
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T
ACTUALLY TELL ME

24:08.000 --> 24:09.750
THAT YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT LEAVING?

24:09.750 --> 24:11.041
I DON'T KNOW.

24:11.041 --> 24:12.625
COME ON, I THINK
THE DECISION HERE
IS PRETTY OBVIOUS.

24:14.083 --> 24:14.542
IS IT?

24:16.625 --> 24:17.834
YEAH.

24:19.834 --> 24:24.333
I MEAN, MOST DAYS
I FEEL FINE, JACK.
I DO.

24:24.333 --> 24:26.083
BUT I'M NOT FINE.

24:26.083 --> 24:28.458
IN FACT,
I'M GETTING WORSE.

24:28.458 --> 24:30.583
AND I THINK THAT
WHOLE TIM THING

24:30.583 --> 24:33.625
IS JUST A CLEAR
INDICATION OF THAT.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.208
AND THE IRONIC
THING IS--

24:35.208 --> 24:36.875
IS THAT THE MORE TIME
I SPEND HERE

24:36.875 --> 24:39.792
WITH EVERYBODY
AND--AND WITH PACEY,

24:39.792 --> 24:41.667
THE MORE I WANT TO
GET BETTER.

24:41.667 --> 24:44.291
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE
I DON'T WANT TO DRAG HIM
DOWN WITH MY PROBLEMS.

24:44.291 --> 24:47.000
I DON'T THINK
PACEY FEELS BURDENED
BY YOU, OK?

24:47.000 --> 24:47.500
I KNOW I DON'T.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.166
BUT I DO.

24:49.166 --> 24:50.708
I FEEL BURDENED
BY THE KNOWLEDGE

24:50.708 --> 24:52.125
THAT I KNOW
HOW HARD IT MUST BE

24:52.125 --> 24:53.708
FOR YOU GUYS TO HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF ME,

24:53.708 --> 24:56.500
AND THAT'S WHY I'VE
DECIDED THAT I THINK

24:56.500 --> 24:57.125
THAT IF I LEAVE,
YOU SHOULD STAY.

24:57.125 --> 25:00.291
NO WAY.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.708
YOU'RE MY FAMILY,
OK? YOU GO, I GO.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.542
WHAT ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT?

25:04.542 --> 25:08.333
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALWAYS
SO SELFLESS, JACK.

25:08.333 --> 25:12.208
WILL YOU PROMISE ME
THAT YOU'LL THINK ABOUT
YOURSELF THIS TIME?

25:45.667 --> 25:47.083
BYE, GRAMS.

25:55.083 --> 25:58.959
THAT'S IT. YOU'RE
GETTING THE HANG OF IT.
GOOD WORK, SON.

25:58.959 --> 26:01.458
THANK YOU. UM...

26:01.458 --> 26:04.041
I, UH...
LOOK, MR. POTTER,

26:04.041 --> 26:06.708
I'M REALLY SORRY
IF I MADE YOU

26:06.708 --> 26:07.667
DREDGE UP SOME
PAINFUL MEMORIES
TODAY.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.708
DON'T WORRY.
IT'S NOT LIKE SOMETHING

26:09.708 --> 26:12.333
I DON'T THINK ABOUT
EVERY WAKING MOMENT.

26:13.417 --> 26:16.542
BUT YOU ASKED ME
WHY I CHANGED.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.875
THE TRUTH IS I'M NOT SURE
HOW MUCH I'VE CHANGED,

26:19.875 --> 26:22.542
BUT I KEEP TRYING

26:22.542 --> 26:26.625
EVERY DAY TO BE
A BETTER PERSON
FOR MY FAMILY.

26:26.625 --> 26:30.041
TO PUT SOMEONE ELSE'S
NEEDS BEFORE YOUR OWN
BECAUSE YOU LOVE THEM...

26:32.041 --> 26:33.417
MEANS EVERYTHING.

26:38.375 --> 26:41.166
I'M GONNA TAKE A WALK.

26:48.417 --> 26:51.708
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
LAID IT ALL OUT LIKE THAT.

26:51.708 --> 26:54.250
I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED.

26:55.625 --> 26:59.000
DAWSON, YOU HAVE IT
ALL WRONG.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.917
I MEAN, CAN'T YOU
TELL BY JUST
LOOKING AT ME

27:01.917 --> 27:04.291
MY LIFE IS PERFECT
RIGHT NOW.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.542
I HAVE JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING I'VE
EVER DREAMT OF.

27:06.542 --> 27:10.208
I MEAN, MY DAD
IS BACK, MY FAMILY
IS TOGETHER AGAIN,

27:10.208 --> 27:11.500
BUSINESS IS GOOD...

27:11.500 --> 27:15.959
BUT BEST OF ALL,
I...

27:15.959 --> 27:17.917
I HAVE YOU
IN MY LIFE.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.083
ADD A WHITE PICKET
FENCE TO THIS
LITTLE SCENARIO

27:22.083 --> 27:25.166
AND THE FAIRY TALE
WOULD BE COMPLETE.

27:25.166 --> 27:27.250
I JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU
PROUD OF ME.

27:30.125 --> 27:30.959
I LOVE YOU...

27:30.959 --> 27:35.750
AND I BELIEVE
IN YOU.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.959
AND I'M SO PROUD
OF YOU,

27:37.959 --> 27:40.500
AND I'M NOT JUST
PROUD OF YOU...

27:42.583 --> 27:44.792
I'M PROUD
TO BE WITH YOU.

28:03.041 --> 28:07.917
YOU CAN EVEN BE
A GREAT CARPENTER
SOMEDAY. WHO KNOWS?

28:07.917 --> 28:09.875
ARE YOU MOCKING ME?

28:13.125 --> 28:15.708
[CLICKING ON KEYBOARD]

28:25.291 --> 28:25.917
I'M STAYING.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.667
AND YOUR SISTER?

28:30.667 --> 28:34.375
I DON'T KNOW
HER DECISION.

28:36.542 --> 28:39.208
WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M NOT GOING.

28:39.208 --> 28:43.917
SO, YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE YOU HERE
ALONE AT 17.

28:43.917 --> 28:47.291
I DON'T THINK SO,
JACK. I'M GONNA BE
SELLING THE HOUSE.

28:47.291 --> 28:49.291
DAD, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE HOUSE.

28:49.291 --> 28:52.500
I CAN'T LIVE WITH YOU,
NOT THE WAY THINGS ARE.

28:57.041 --> 29:02.166
YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR
MOTHER'S ILLNESS
AND ANDIE'S PROBLEMS

29:02.166 --> 29:03.875
AND EVEN
WITH TIM'S DEATH,

29:03.875 --> 29:06.708
THOSE I COULD
FIND REASONS FOR.

29:06.708 --> 29:08.708
BUT WITH YOU...

29:08.708 --> 29:11.500
I FEEL
LIKE I'M TO BLAME.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.875
BUT YOU AREN'T.

29:12.875 --> 29:13.917
IF I'D JUST
BEEN AROUND MORE.

29:13.917 --> 29:16.333
IT WOULDN'T HAVE
MADE A DIFFERENCE.

29:16.333 --> 29:19.542
I'M GAY FOR THE SAME REASONS
THAT TIM WASN'T, OK?

29:19.542 --> 29:20.792
IT JUST HAPPENED
THAT WAY.

29:20.792 --> 29:21.959
BUT THERE ARE
PEOPLE WHO CHANGE.

29:24.667 --> 29:26.792
THEY GO BACK.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.083
I'M HARDLY THE ENCYCLOPEDIA
OF THE GAY EXPERIENCE,

29:31.083 --> 29:34.208
BUT I'D WAGER TO SAY
THAT THEIR CHANGE
IS SKEPTICAL.

29:34.208 --> 29:36.250
HOW DO YOU KNOW
UNLESS YOU TRY?

29:36.250 --> 29:40.041
I DON'T WANT TO TRY, OK?
YOU WANT ME TO TRY.

29:40.041 --> 29:42.417
BECAUSE I CANNOT
UNDERSTAND

29:42.417 --> 29:44.708
HOW ANYONE
WOULD CHOOSE
THAT KIND OF LIFE.

29:44.708 --> 29:49.041
I DIDN'T CHOOSE IT.
THE ONLY THING I CHOSE
WAS JUST TO BE HAPPY.

29:50.708 --> 29:53.041
LOOK...

29:53.041 --> 29:55.083
I CAN'T GO BACK WITH YOU
BECAUSE, SLOWLY BUT SURELY,

29:55.083 --> 29:59.125
I'M GOING TO SACRIFICE
MY HAPPINESS FOR YOURS

29:59.125 --> 30:04.250
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO
BE PROUD OF ME. I DO.

30:04.250 --> 30:07.125
BUT NOT UNDER YOUR TERMS.
IT JUST--IT WON'T WORK.

30:11.542 --> 30:13.834
JACK. JACK...

30:49.834 --> 30:52.291
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE WE ARE?

30:52.291 --> 30:55.500
WE'RE BY THE WATER?

30:55.500 --> 30:57.583
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

30:57.583 --> 31:00.083
UH...

31:00.083 --> 31:04.291
OF COURSE I REMEMBER.
THIS WAS WHERE
WE FIRST DANCED.

31:04.291 --> 31:07.417
AND WHERE WE HAD
OUR FIRST KISS.

31:07.417 --> 31:10.625
I REMEMBER MY KNEES
WERE SHAKING LIKE CRAZY.

31:10.625 --> 31:15.417
I KNOW, MY HEART, IT WAS,
LIKE, BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-
BOOM-BOOM-BOOM.

31:15.417 --> 31:18.000
I WAS DELIRIOUSLY
HAPPY.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.333
I DIED AND WENT
TO HEAVEN THAT DAY.

31:20.333 --> 31:23.750
MAN, THAT WAS
A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.

31:23.750 --> 31:24.667
IT SEEMS LIKE YESTERDAY.

31:24.667 --> 31:26.583
WHAT WAS I BACK THEN?

31:26.583 --> 31:29.417
A SLACKER.

31:29.417 --> 31:31.041
THAT'S WHAT YOU
THOUGHT, ISN'T IT?

31:31.041 --> 31:32.875
YOU THOUGHT I WAS
A LAZY BRAT.

31:32.875 --> 31:34.875
AND YOU THOUGHT I WAS
A SPOILED PRINCESS.

31:34.875 --> 31:37.875
MAN, YOU DIDN'T
LET ME GET AWAY
WITH ANYTHING BACK THEN.

31:37.875 --> 31:41.208

FAVORITE PASTIME WAS
MAKING ME MISERABLE.

OH, BOY, I HATED YOU.

31:42.625 --> 31:43.959
NO, I
HATED YOU MORE.

31:43.959 --> 31:46.208
OH, ANDIE,
I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

31:48.083 --> 31:49.542
IT'S BEEN
A WILD RIDE.

31:49.542 --> 31:51.959
IT'S ONLY JUST BEGUN.

31:55.166 --> 31:56.875
MAY I HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF THIS DANCE, MISS McPHEE?

31:56.875 --> 32:00.500
YES, MR. WITTER,
YOU MAY.

32:12.125 --> 32:14.625
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

32:16.000 --> 32:19.750
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
TO BE WITH YOU.

32:19.750 --> 32:24.041
AND, UM,
I'M SO SAD, TOO...

32:27.208 --> 32:30.667
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU
SO MUCH, PACEY.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.917
AND I CAN'T HIDE
FROM THE TRUTH
ANYMORE.

32:33.917 --> 32:36.291
I'M NOT GETTING
ANY BETTER.

32:39.583 --> 32:42.041
ALSO BECAUSE...

32:42.959 --> 32:45.208
I'M GONNA
LEAVE TOMORROW.

32:48.375 --> 32:50.667
I HAVE TO.

32:50.667 --> 32:52.166
I KNOW.

32:55.083 --> 32:56.542
I KNOW.

33:01.708 --> 33:03.667
UM, NO GOOD-BYES,
OK?

33:03.667 --> 33:06.500
NO, NO GOOD-BYES.

34:31.708 --> 34:33.583
HELLO.
GOOD MORNING.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.083
DAWSON, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

34:35.083 --> 34:36.542
I'VE BEEN HERE
ALL NIGHT.
SHUT YOUR EYES.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.083
LOOK, IT'S 7:00
IN THE MORNING.

34:37.083 --> 34:37.875
SHUT YOUR EYES.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.958
I HAVE MY PAJAMAS ON.

34:39.958 --> 34:41.792
CLOSE 'EM. YOU LOOK
BEAUTIFUL. COME ON.

34:41.792 --> 34:42.708
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:42.708 --> 34:46.458
WALK WITH ME.
KEEP YOUR EYES SHUT.

34:46.458 --> 34:46.875
OK, STAIRS COMIN' UP.

34:46.875 --> 34:48.667

34:48.667 --> 34:49.583
I GOT YOU. READY?

34:49.583 --> 34:53.958
1, 2, 3. YOU'RE
ON THE GROUND. OK.

34:53.958 --> 34:57.083
OK, STOP, STOP, STOP. OK?

34:57.083 --> 34:59.125
NOW, OPEN 'EM.

35:07.417 --> 35:09.917
A WHITE PICKET FENCE.

35:09.917 --> 35:10.959
YEP.

35:10.959 --> 35:12.542
WHEN DID YOU DO THIS?

35:12.542 --> 35:13.834
IT TOOK ME ALL NIGHT.

35:13.834 --> 35:15.375
IT'S A LITTLE CROOKED
DOWN AT THE END THERE,

35:15.375 --> 35:17.083
BUT, UH...

35:17.083 --> 35:19.083
YOU KNOW.

35:21.166 --> 35:23.375
THANK YOU.

35:23.375 --> 35:25.083
I FIGURED IT'LL
PROBABLY TAKE ME

35:25.083 --> 35:26.750
THE REST OF THE SUMMER
TO FINISH THE THING.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.375
YOU HANGING OUT
IN MY FRONT YARD
ALL SUMMER?

35:29.375 --> 35:33.291
I THINK I CAN
HANDLE THAT.

35:33.291 --> 35:35.792
MAYBE IT'S TIME I STARTED
CLIMBING THROUGH YOUR WINDOW
FOR A CHANGE, HUH?

35:35.792 --> 35:37.583
CHANGE COULD BE GOOD.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.583
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU
WERE GONNA GET AWAY

36:02.583 --> 36:04.250
WITHOUT A SEND-OFF,
DID YOU?

36:04.250 --> 36:07.250
OH, WELL, YOU
MISSED THE PARADE.
IT JUST LEFT.

36:10.166 --> 36:13.542
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
YOUR PARENTS SAID YES.

36:13.542 --> 36:14.834
NOT QUITE.

36:14.834 --> 36:18.625
I CALLED MY MOM,

36:18.625 --> 36:21.250
AND SHE CASUALLY
INFORMED ME

36:21.250 --> 36:23.291
THAT NOW IS NOT
NOT A VERY GOOD TIME

36:23.291 --> 36:26.000
FOR ME TO RE-ENTER
HER LIFE, AND...

36:28.792 --> 36:32.041
AND MY DAD SAID THAT
HE'S STILL GETTING OVER
MY LAST STAY WITH THEM.

36:32.041 --> 36:34.917
I TOLD HIM
I WAS DIFFERENT

36:34.917 --> 36:37.166
AND THAT I WOULDN'T
BE A WORRY THIS TIME.

36:37.166 --> 36:42.583
HE WANTED TO KNOW IF THIS
WAS JUST A PLOY TO GET
MORE MONEY EVERY MONTH.

36:42.583 --> 36:44.000
JEN, I'M SORRY.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.500
I JUST FIGURE,
SCREW IT, RIGHT?

36:45.500 --> 36:48.291
LOOK, I DON'T NEED
THEM AS MY DESTINATION.

36:48.291 --> 36:50.208
IF I'M GONNA LEAVE
CAPESIDE, THEN WHAT'S
HOLDING ME BACK?

36:50.208 --> 36:52.917
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER PLACE TO GO?

36:52.917 --> 36:54.166
NO. I'VE GOT
EVERY PLACE TO GO.

36:54.166 --> 36:56.125
THERE'S JUST NOBODY THERE.

37:02.333 --> 37:06.542
LOOK, I OFTEN WONDER
HOW MY MOM WOULD REACT

37:06.542 --> 37:10.875
IF SHE WAS AWARE
OF WHAT WAS
HAPPENING WITH ME,

37:10.875 --> 37:13.500
IF SHE WAS MENTALLY CAPABLE
OF COMPREHENDING IT.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.625
I DON'T THINK SHE'D
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT

37:15.625 --> 37:19.250
BECAUSE MY MOM LOVES ME FOR
THE BEST REASON POSSIBLE--

37:19.250 --> 37:22.542
NO REASON AT ALL.

37:22.542 --> 37:26.959
SEE, THAT'S HOW OUR
PARENTS SHOULD LOVE US, JEN.
UNCONDITIONALLY.

37:26.959 --> 37:29.375
SAD AS IT SOUNDS,
MOST DON'T.

37:29.375 --> 37:33.667
BUT AS MUCH AS IT HURTS,
IT'S WORSE FOR THEM.

37:35.250 --> 37:39.458
IT IS WORSE TO BE
INCAPABLE OF LOVING
THAN TO NOT BE LOVED.

37:48.750 --> 37:51.917
WAIT. NO, JACK.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:51.917 --> 37:54.542
WELL, I AM, UM,

37:54.542 --> 37:57.625
I'M TAKING YOU
BACK TO MY PLACE.

37:57.625 --> 37:58.458
IT'S PRETTY EMPTY,

37:58.458 --> 38:02.708
AND, UH, I CAN
USE A ROOMMATE.

38:02.708 --> 38:04.875
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

38:07.166 --> 38:08.792
YEAH.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.333
YEAH.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.208
MR. POTTER?

38:50.750 --> 38:52.542
I GOT YOUR TOOLS.

39:16.291 --> 39:18.083
LET THE
GOOD TIMES ROLL.

39:40.208 --> 39:42.208
HEY.

39:48.708 --> 39:49.834
WHAT'S WRONG?

39:50.834 --> 39:53.291
NOTHING.

39:54.583 --> 39:55.583
NOTHING'S WRONG.

39:57.959 --> 39:59.708
OK.

40:06.750 --> 40:08.542
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

40:22.875 --> 40:25.417
I'M NOT THE BEST
FATHER, I KNOW THAT.

40:25.417 --> 40:29.041
BUT I DO WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

40:31.708 --> 40:33.208
THANK YOU.

40:41.708 --> 40:42.917
ANDIE, ANDIE.

40:42.917 --> 40:45.583
HEY.

40:45.583 --> 40:48.750
PACEY, WE SAID
NO GOOD-BYES.

40:48.750 --> 40:52.959
I DON'T WANT TO SAY
GOOD-BYE. I JUST
WANT TO LOOK AT YOU.

40:54.750 --> 40:59.333
I WISH I HAD SOME
ELOQUENT PARTING
WORDS FOR YOU,

40:59.333 --> 41:01.959
BUT ALL I COULD
THINK OF WAS THIS--

41:01.959 --> 41:09.208
THANK YOU. THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

41:09.208 --> 41:10.667
THANK YOU
FOR FORCING ME

41:10.667 --> 41:12.750
TO BE THE MAN
THAT YOU'VE MADE ME.

41:12.750 --> 41:14.583
JUST THANK YOU.

41:14.583 --> 41:17.542
I'M SO GRATEFUL
TO YOU, ANDIE.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.000
OH, I DON'T WANT
TO LET YOU GO, PACEY.

41:28.542 --> 41:30.750
JUST REMEMBER
YOUR PROMISE, OK?

41:33.125 --> 41:34.625
YOU AND ME,

41:34.625 --> 41:39.083
TOGETHER AGAIN,
HAPPY, HEALTHY,

41:39.083 --> 41:40.625
AND MORE IN LOVE
THAN EVER.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.500
I'LL REMEMBER.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.542
GO GET BETTER,
McPHEE.

41:48.708 --> 41:49.834
THEN YOU
HURRY BACK TO ME.

41:52.708 --> 41:56.500
PACEY, KISS ME.

42:06.625 --> 42:07.500
MY KNEES ARE SHAKING.

42:07.500 --> 42:13.166
MY HEART, BOOM-BOOM,
BOOM-BOOM.

42:38.708 --> 42:39.750
[CAR ENGINE STARTS]

43:01.208 --> 43:03.083
Dawson: WE'RE TAUGHT TO BELIEVE
THAT IN THE MOVIES,

43:03.083 --> 43:06.291
THE MAIN CHARACTER GOES
THROUGH AN ARC AND CHANGES.

43:06.291 --> 43:09.166
BUT WHAT IF THAT'S NOT TRUE?

43:09.166 --> 43:11.083
BY THE END OF CASABLANCA,

43:11.083 --> 43:13.959
BOGART'S THE SAME
LONELY TOUGH GUY
THAT HE ALWAYS WAS.

43:17.250 --> 43:19.667
HIS DECISIONS
DIDN'T CHANGE HIM,

43:19.667 --> 43:22.041
NOR DID HIS ACTIONS.

43:22.041 --> 43:25.250
THEY SEEMED TO REVEAL
WHAT WAS ALWAYS THERE--

43:25.250 --> 43:28.625
A MAN WHO WANTED TO CHANGE,
BUT FEARED HE COULDN'T.

43:30.250 --> 43:33.708
IF BOGART REALLY WANTED
TO CHANGE, HE WOULDN'T
HAVE SENT HIS LOVE AWAY.

43:33.708 --> 43:34.959
HE WOULD HAVE HELD ON
TO HER FOR DEAR LIFE,

43:34.959 --> 43:40.458
BECAUSE I THINK
LOVE IS  CHANGE.

43:50.458 --> 43:51.917
OR AT LEAST I HOPE SO.
