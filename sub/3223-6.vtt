00:03.360 --> 00:05.283
- Hey. You Dean?
- Hey, Garth.

00:05.520 --> 00:08.364
- Garth.
- Oh, Marmaduke. You're crazy.

00:08.560 --> 00:09.891
He grows on you.

00:13.840 --> 00:16.525
- What'd I miss?
- You're right. He has grown on me.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.848
The nicest thing anyone's ever said
to me.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.647
- I don't hunt anymore.
- You quit?

00:21.840 --> 00:23.205
- Yeah.
- What could possibly...

00:23.400 --> 00:25.846
...make you stop just like that?
Was there a girl?

00:26.080 --> 00:27.889
Yeah. Amelia.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.889
- What about you?
- What about me?

00:36.720 --> 00:37.801
I'm Benny.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.490
I can see you two have a lot
to talk about.

00:59.920 --> 01:02.400
Now, what do you think the year is on that?

01:02.600 --> 01:06.810
- So it's only the turn of the century.
- Turn of the century, you'll have...

01:11.120 --> 01:14.886
...at the bottom of that.
- Yeah, there's very little...

01:16.080 --> 01:19.050
Hey, hon, just in time.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.163
Grab me a cold one, would you?

01:21.360 --> 01:23.806
Why don't you have Sara Alcott
get it for you?

01:24.640 --> 01:25.721
What?

01:28.160 --> 01:30.128
Aah! Oh, my God!

01:30.480 --> 01:31.720
Mary, help.

01:32.480 --> 01:35.609
Get the... Mary, what are you doing?
Mary, what are you doing?

01:35.800 --> 01:36.961
Mary. Mary, help me.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.046
Mary.

01:39.280 --> 01:40.770
Mary!

01:41.600 --> 01:43.489
No!

01:55.480 --> 01:56.845
Heads up.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.282
I caught wind of a case
on this police scanner.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.403
Sounds like our kind of thing.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.088
I wasn't even gone 10 minutes.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.930
Okay. That matters why?

02:07.760 --> 02:11.162
How about because you haven't said
a word to me since Prentiss Island?

02:11.400 --> 02:13.926
Now what? You want me
to shut up and ride shotgun...

02:14.120 --> 02:15.770
...and act like nothing happened?

02:16.320 --> 02:18.084
You wanna talk about Benny?

02:18.320 --> 02:20.687
- Fine, let's talk.
- Okay.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.646
How about he's a vampire?

02:23.840 --> 02:27.447
He's also the reason I'm topside,
not roasting in purgatory. Anything else?

02:27.640 --> 02:30.644
Don't pretend I don't get it.
You had to do what you had to do.

02:30.840 --> 02:33.002
I highly doubt you get anything
about purgatory.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.601
But you're out now.
And Benny's still breathing.

02:35.840 --> 02:36.966
Why?

02:39.280 --> 02:41.282
He's my friend, Sam.

02:43.640 --> 02:46.007
And what about my friend, Amy,
she was what?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.646
You sure as hell
didn't have a problem ganking her.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.729
Well, I guess people change,
don%they?

02:50.920 --> 02:53.241
We let that werewolf Kate go,
didn't we?

02:53.480 --> 02:55.847
She was different.
You think Benny's different?

02:57.160 --> 03:00.482
Heh. He tell you he's not
drinking live blood or something?

03:03.320 --> 03:05.800
And you believe him. Wow.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.525
Okay. No, you're right.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.801
People do change.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.681
Yeah. I got a vampire buddy
and you turn your phone off for a year.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.691
Don't turn this on me.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.726
Look. Benny slips up and some other
hunter turns his lights out, so be it.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.006
But it's not gonna be you, right?

03:27.400 --> 03:29.243
You coming or not?

03:43.240 --> 03:46.562
So guy's old lady comes home
while he's working underneath his ride...

03:46.760 --> 03:49.240
...puts pedal to the metal,
takes half his head off.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.807
- And that's it?
- Yeah, in a nutshell.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.646
She says she blacked out,
doesn't remember a damn thing.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.207
- Well, that sounds like insanity.
- Maybe.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.971
So how's that make this
our kind of thing?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.931
Because, Sam,
Kevin's in the wind, okay?

04:04.120 --> 04:06.691
You're sulking around like a eunuch
in a whorehouse...

04:06.880 --> 04:10.202
...and I can't help but ask myself:
When is decapitation not my thing?

04:15.120 --> 04:17.088
Whoa, whoa.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.925
- FBI?
- Yeah.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.043
Happened to be in the neighborhood.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.363
- First a Texas Ranger, now you guys.
- Texas Ranger?

04:25.560 --> 04:29.281
Yes, sir. Right over there.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.969
You gotta be kidding me.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.251
Hey, Chuck Norris.

04:48.160 --> 04:50.766
- Sam? Dean?
- Shh.

04:52.840 --> 04:53.887
Forgot he was a hugger.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.650
- Come here.
- All right. Okay.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.446
Okay. We're still working here.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.120
You guys have no idea
how much I missed you.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.963
- Excuse us, would you?
- Yeah, we'll be right back.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.966
A Texas Ranger, Garth? Seriously?
We're in Missouri.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.611
What? Come on.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.485
I look like a funeral director
in one of those.

05:15.520 --> 05:18.490
Wow. I heard some chatter you two
were back in the batter's box...

05:18.680 --> 05:20.444
...but I didn't believe it till now.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.567
Oh, uh, one sec.

05:27.840 --> 05:30.127
Yo, Earl, what you got?

05:30.320 --> 05:31.481
A Revenant.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.690
Okay, uh, you'll need a casket
and some silver spikes.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.882
Oh, and don't get bit.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.526
No, it won't turn you, ha,
but it will hurt like hell.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.007
So once you got all that,
nail that sucker in...

05:42.200 --> 05:44.965
...bury him and throw away the key.
Okay?

05:45.160 --> 05:47.322
All right, hasta.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.726
What are you doing?

05:49.680 --> 05:50.806
My job, hombre.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.081
- Your job?
- Yeah.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.487
And since when is you giving advice
your job?

05:54.680 --> 05:56.125
Hold up.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.482
- Are you the new Bobby?
- You shut your mouth.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.208
- Yes.
- You shut your mouth.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.247
What?

06:04.640 --> 06:06.324
Bobby was gone, you two were MIA.

06:06.520 --> 06:07.601
It was a weird time.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.562
Somebody had to step in
and take up the slack.

06:13.880 --> 06:18.408
All right. Let's just get back to work
and we'll talk about this later, all right?

06:19.720 --> 06:22.087
Did Garth just tell us what to do?

06:23.440 --> 06:26.683
Uh, Scott Lew,
these gentlemen here are with the FBI.

06:26.880 --> 06:31.169
Mr. Lew's parents were the individuals
involved in this unfortunate situation.

06:31.360 --> 06:34.682
- Sorry for your loss.
- Just a few questions, Mr. Lew.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.129
By any chance, were your parents having
marital problems?

06:38.320 --> 06:42.564
- No. No more than anyone else.
- Well, what about your mother's health?

06:42.760 --> 06:46.321
Any chance this was a seizure, a stroke,
anything that might explain this?

06:46.520 --> 06:47.567
I don't think so.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.406
They're checking her out
at the hospital right now.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.245
What about stranger behavior?

06:52.440 --> 06:54.090
Stranger? How?

06:54.280 --> 06:57.284
Hearing voices, seeing things.
Your mother mention anything like that?

06:58.760 --> 07:01.923
My parents were married for 30 years.
High school sweethearts.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.600
There's no good explanation
for why this happened...

07:04.800 --> 07:07.041
...no matter where you wanna look.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.081
Okay. Well, thank you, Scott.

07:10.320 --> 07:11.970
We'll be in touch.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.608
No EMF.
No traces of sulfur anywhere.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.491
Like I thought, bust.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.969
Hold on there, Sam,
there's a lot of things to factor in here.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.209
Uh, happened last night,
readings could be cold by now.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.483
- Good point.
- And even if there was any sulfur...

07:40.680 --> 07:44.048
...Barney Fife and crew probably
contaminated the crime scene...

07:44.240 --> 07:47.642
- ...any evidence that was here with it.
- Wow, he's on a roll.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.365
Yeah, that's one word for it.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.209
Uh, guys, I think I found something.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.968
Is that gum or is that ectoplasm?

07:58.200 --> 08:00.851
Ectoplasm is usually black, right?

08:04.320 --> 08:07.881
Mm. Definitely ectoplasm.

08:08.520 --> 08:11.171
So, what are we thinking?
Some kind of ghost, right?

08:18.360 --> 08:20.840
- Ranger McCrae.
- One of those things rings Hammer...

08:21.040 --> 08:23.008
- ...I'm throwing down.
- Great.

08:23.480 --> 08:24.561
Okay.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.403
Okay.

08:30.880 --> 08:34.645
Thanks, doc.
Asked the coroner to drop me a line...

08:34.840 --> 08:37.241
...in case the autopsy turned up
anything unusual.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.369
And guess what.

08:39.559 --> 08:42.086
Dead guy had the word "Alcott"
carved into his chest.

08:43.799 --> 08:46.121
- With what?
- Coroner's best guess:

08:46.320 --> 08:48.766
His wife Mary's fingernails.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.651
Mrs. Lew,
can you tell us what happened?

08:52.400 --> 08:55.324
I was at the store getting groceries...

08:55.520 --> 09:01.289
...and the next thing I know
my son Scott finds me in the driveway.

09:02.920 --> 09:05.082
And Chester was...

09:08.440 --> 09:11.683
Do you remember anything at all
about what happened, um...

09:12.000 --> 09:14.685
...with Chester dying?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.001
Not really.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.607
Bits and pieces, I guess.

09:27.480 --> 09:28.561
Such as?

09:29.680 --> 09:32.570
I remember his screams.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.965
The smell of burnt rubber and...

09:36.440 --> 09:39.011
I remember feeling so angry.

09:39.200 --> 09:43.888
Just uncontrollable rage.
Like, I wasn't myself.

09:44.080 --> 09:49.610
And after it was over,
all that anger was just gone.

09:49.800 --> 09:54.283
Uh, Ma'am, does the word "Alcott"
mean anything to you?

09:58.120 --> 10:00.441
What does she have to do
with anything?

10:00.640 --> 10:01.721
It's a she?

10:02.160 --> 10:05.050
My husband Chester and I
were going steady in high school...

10:05.240 --> 10:07.447
...for years already
when we had a big fight.

10:07.640 --> 10:11.008
- What about?
- Something stupid, I'm sure.

10:11.280 --> 10:15.649
It was around prom so he took
Sara Alcott as his date instead of me.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.362
So this Sara Alcott was a rival
for your husband's affections?

10:20.000 --> 10:22.446
Sara had one night with him.

10:22.680 --> 10:25.160
Whereas I was with Chester
for 37 years.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.570
Of course, right. Sure.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.250
Just one more question.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.403
Um, ahem...

10:31.600 --> 10:34.729
ls Miss Alcott still alive?

10:34.920 --> 10:36.684
As far as I know, yes.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.641
Thank you very much, Mrs. Lew.

10:41.280 --> 10:45.080
So let me get this straight. This poor guy
goes to prom with some girl...

10:45.280 --> 10:48.284
...over 30 years ago, and because
of that he's now a pancake?

10:48.480 --> 10:50.482
If this is a ghost,
maybe it's possession.

10:50.680 --> 10:52.648
What? You heard her, Alcott's alive.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.087
Well, we're definitely
gonna wanna talk to her.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.442
Yeah, sounds like a plan.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.091
Did we eat yet?

11:00.280 --> 11:02.203
Oh, yeah.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.201
- All right.
- There you go.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.731
Mm. Thanks.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.804
- Keep them coming.
- All right.

11:10.560 --> 11:14.690
So, Dean, give me the skinny.
Where were you this past year?

11:16.040 --> 11:19.328
Why don't we save what I did on
my summer vacation for another time?

11:19.520 --> 11:21.488
Ah, come on.

11:23.560 --> 11:24.925
All right.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.446
I was in purgatory.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.525
Like, uh, "purgatory" purgatory?

11:32.560 --> 11:34.050
No. The one in Miami.

11:34.240 --> 11:37.323
Man, that's balls.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.769
That's not how you say balls.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.771
So how'd you get out?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.886
What's up
with all the hillbilly hankies?

11:51.080 --> 11:53.128
These people know Civil War is over,
right?

11:53.320 --> 11:55.766
That's a touchy subject
around these parts.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.611
See, Missouri was a border state.

11:59.080 --> 12:02.926
So half the men were Confederate,
the other half were the Union.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.765
How do you know all this?

12:05.960 --> 12:07.041
I went to college.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.570
- You went to college?
- Yeah.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.524
College, then on to dental school.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.688
Wait. You were a dentist?

12:13.880 --> 12:15.769
Yeah, just for like a hot minute.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.843
Where do you think
I got my first case?

12:18.920 --> 12:20.285
Let me guess.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.606
Tooth fairy.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.600
Yeah.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.882
I mean,
I felt terrible when I ganked that SOB.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.449
You killed the tooth fairy?

12:39.640 --> 12:40.687
Yeah, man.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.487
I mean, not my proudest moment,
but, heh, it happened.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.401
Man, this is good.

13:00.800 --> 13:04.805
Hey, hon. Just grabbing some joe
on the way to the hospital.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.331
Gonna bring Mom her stuff.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.364
Oh, crap, Jeff's here.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.969
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.844
Okay.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.089
Love you.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.365
Hey, Scott, how's...?

13:48.200 --> 13:50.567
Look, I heard about what happened
with your folks.

13:50.800 --> 13:54.441
I'm really sorry. If there's anything,
I mean anything, that I can do...

13:54.680 --> 13:56.125
...just ask, man, please.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.522
How about getting me my money back,
Jeff?

14:03.200 --> 14:05.202
No, wait!

14:29.760 --> 14:33.242
So first the Mom goes
Natural Born Killer, and now the son?

14:33.440 --> 14:36.762
I mean, what do we got?
A ghost with an Oedipus complex?

14:37.240 --> 14:38.844
I don't know what that means.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.246
Check that out.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.603
"Sussex."
What is that? Another name?

14:43.920 --> 14:46.651
I don't know.
Hey. What'd the cops say?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.449
Oh, come on.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.603
Not much. Scott insisted
he wasn't in control of himself...

14:54.800 --> 14:56.882
...says all he remembers
is a red-hot rage.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.202
So, what is this? Some
kind of family curse?

14:59.400 --> 15:00.731
Is that Bobby's hat?

15:01.120 --> 15:02.406
Oh, yeah. Sure is.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.765
We worked a Rugaru case together
a few years back.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.807
He left it in my car.
So I kept it as a memento.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.401
- What are you doing?
- It's not how you wear it.

15:13.320 --> 15:18.451
Gentlemen, surveillance is up,
but something is all screwy with it.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.928
Must be the camera.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.925
Yeah. Thank you there, deputy.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.126
- You see the head?
- Yeah.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.921
- You ever seen anything like that before?
- Like that? No way.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.810
- So?
- So...

15:37.000 --> 15:39.287
So I'm thinking we need to talk
to Sara Alcott.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.245
I found her. Although these days
she goes by Sara Brown.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.808
I'll check her out, and you two see
what you can find out about Sussex.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.281
- Word.
- Awesome.

15:54.680 --> 15:58.890
Now, I know you didn't come
all this way for my sweet tea, agent.

15:59.080 --> 16:01.128
Ha. No.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.527
Actually, I'm here about Chester Lew.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.330
Oh, yes.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.483
- So sad.
- It is.

16:07.680 --> 16:11.287
Is it true you and Chester dated
a ways back?

16:11.480 --> 16:14.643
Well, that is an odd question for the FBI,
isn't it?

16:16.360 --> 16:19.125
You wouldn't believe
the questions I've had to ask people.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.367
Yeah, ha, ha.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.369
Well, ahem, yes.

16:22.560 --> 16:27.009
Yes. Me and that old tomcat Chester,
we went to prom together.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.281
That's about it.

16:29.480 --> 16:30.561
And that's all?

16:32.200 --> 16:37.081
Well, I wasn't exactly a good girl,
if that's what you mean.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.687
Then after that,
I thought that Chester and I...

16:41.880 --> 16:45.726
...were gonna be hot and heavy.
But it just wasn't meant to be.

16:45.920 --> 16:49.083
And a week later he eloped with Mary.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.090
Did you speak much
to Mary or Chester again after that?

16:52.840 --> 16:55.844
Well, I'd see them about.
You know, picnics and such.

16:56.040 --> 17:00.489
But Mary kept Chester
on a pretty short leash.

17:00.680 --> 17:04.002
Honestly, I'd moved on,
but it seems she never did.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.890
And why do you think that is?

17:06.680 --> 17:12.210
Well, I guess in her mind,
I was a reminder of Chester's betrayal.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.003
Huh.

17:15.119 --> 17:16.451
So if that's all...

17:17.200 --> 17:20.089
Yes.
Thank you very much for your help.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.283
It's been a long time
since I let myself go like that.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.883
Yeah, I know what you mean.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.809
You asked me if I lost someone.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.809
I did.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.482
My husband.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.402
He died in Afghanistan
eight months ago.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.648
That must have been...

18:08.120 --> 18:09.451
I can't imagine.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.290
Yeah.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.406
We were together forever.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.645
Or at least it seemed that way.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.283
And then one day Don just enlists.

18:24.480 --> 18:25.891
Didn't ask me.

18:26.120 --> 18:29.442
Just said something
about wanting to do the right thing.

18:30.280 --> 18:34.649
The next thing I know
he's off overseas and I'm all alone.

18:36.440 --> 18:40.570
I got a couple letters,
some phone calls...

18:40.800 --> 18:43.451
...and then the knock at the door.

18:44.440 --> 18:46.044
Just like that.

18:46.920 --> 18:52.768
And everywhere I looked,
all I could see was judgment and pity...

18:52.960 --> 18:56.123
...and just this constant reminder
of Don everywhere.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.207
So I moved here...

19:01.680 --> 19:05.366
...and became even more of a hot mess
than I already was.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.241
And you hit a dog.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.569
Easy there, flyweight.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.203
Last time you drank a beer,
I had to pick you up off the floor.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.770
You're such an idjit.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.242
"Idjit's" supposed to be used angrily.

19:51.360 --> 19:52.691
Okay? Not happy.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.400
If you're gonna butcher it,
don't say it at all.

19:55.600 --> 19:58.285
Whoa, then. Okay.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.286
Look, none of my business...

20:01.480 --> 20:04.370
...but this have anything to do
with you and Sam?

20:04.560 --> 20:07.040
Yeah, you had it right.
It's none of your business.

20:07.240 --> 20:11.006
Okay. Just seems that you guys
are a little tense around each other.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.202
Ahem. We're fine.

20:13.440 --> 20:14.805
Can we get back to work?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.002
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.884
All right.

20:19.200 --> 20:22.329
Just letting you know
that I'm here for you, for anything.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.802
I know sometimes Bobby, he would...

20:27.000 --> 20:28.445
You're not Bobby.

20:28.880 --> 20:29.927
Okay?

20:30.320 --> 20:32.402
You're never gonna be Bobby.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.647
So stop.

20:41.400 --> 20:45.041
Bobby belonged to all of us, Dean,
not just you and Sam.

20:48.520 --> 20:53.128
I'm just taking what he showed me and
trying do something with it. That's all.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.130
See if you can find something...

20:59.360 --> 21:03.285
...in that bourbon-drenched book of his
so we can get the hell out of Dixie.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.642
Yeah. I'm on it.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.807
Hey.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.647
Sussex is not a who, it's a what.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.366
A business that went belly up
about a year ago. Look.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.803
- So the guy that Scott brained?
- Mm-hm.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.605
His old business partner.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.968
Ran the company into the ground.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.730
So Scott had a beef with Jeff.

21:30.600 --> 21:32.204
Looks like.

21:35.320 --> 21:36.890
Hey, you're on speaker.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.401
Sara Alcott's clean.
If you look past the fact...

21:39.600 --> 21:42.331
...that she and Chester knocked boots
on prom night.

21:42.520 --> 21:46.286
Okay, so Mary has a grudge
against Sara...

21:46.480 --> 21:49.370
...and Scott has a grudge
against Jeff.

21:49.560 --> 21:53.042
Besides this making my head hurt,
how does this add up to a ghost?

21:53.240 --> 21:55.561
Guys. Bobby has it right here.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.331
Green goo equals a Spectre.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.568
- Which equals ghost, right?
- Yeah, kind of.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.330
A Spectre is an avenging ghost.

22:02.520 --> 22:06.161
It possesses you and finds out
whatever betrayals you're feeling...

22:06.360 --> 22:07.805
...forces you to act on them.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.924
Bobby say anything in there
about how we hunt these things?

22:11.120 --> 22:14.169
The last Spectre he encountered
rose shortly...

22:14.360 --> 22:16.567
...after someone desecrated
a nearby grave.

22:21.880 --> 22:23.041
Which...

22:24.160 --> 22:27.687
There was a grave
desecrated locally three days ago.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.120
Says here...

22:29.840 --> 22:31.365
Oh.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.405
This could get awkward.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.484
What?

22:39.560 --> 22:43.645
- The Unknown Soldier? You kidding me?
- Mary Lew steamrolled her husband...

22:43.880 --> 22:46.451
...the day after this place
was vandalized. Do the math.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.608
The Unknown Soldier
was buried in Arlington.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.842
This is the Confederate Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier.

22:51.160 --> 22:55.006
See, the idea was they took a faceless,
nameless soldier they couldn't identify...

22:55.200 --> 22:58.044
...and buried him here to commemorate
all the soldiers who died.

22:58.240 --> 23:01.244
- What, did you learn that in college?
- No. Civil War reenactments.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.687
Once a year, every year.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.444
Don't hate.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.289
Okay. What about the guard?

23:09.480 --> 23:11.608
Oh, he's ceremonial. Gone by dusk.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.564
- So then we do this tonight?
- Yeah.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.890
Burn a Confederate soldier's bones
in a town full of rednecks? Sure.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.923
Place doesn't look disturbed to me.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.929
What's the police report say?

23:45.120 --> 23:47.088
They think it was just kids
messing around.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.288
They found some beer cans,
some graffiti.

23:49.480 --> 23:52.609
Casket was open when they got here,
but they closed that back up.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.326
Not before Casper
had a chance to make a run for it.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.649
What, if they never touched this,
none of this would be happening?

23:58.840 --> 24:00.330
Yeah, according to Bobby.

24:01.760 --> 24:05.890
All right,
well, let's get this party started.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.041
Sammy, you wanna give me a hand?

24:12.800 --> 24:13.847
And go.

24:22.640 --> 24:23.687
Whoa.

24:23.880 --> 24:27.487
Check out this hardware.
Do you guys know how much this is worth?

24:27.800 --> 24:30.690
Yeah, but why open it up
if you're not gonna take anything?

24:30.880 --> 24:32.006
I don't know.

24:32.800 --> 24:35.326
Maybe the cops showed up
and they had to split fast.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.490
- Sure this'll work, even on a Spectre?
- It's a ghost, isn't it?

24:39.680 --> 24:42.923
Burn its bones, ghost disappears.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.644
- All right.
- All right, all right.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.929
I feel like we should say something,
all right? Don't you?

24:53.280 --> 24:55.009
Just a little...

24:58.480 --> 25:00.084
Sure.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.280
We won.

25:10.680 --> 25:13.251
Write that up for me, would you, Doug?

25:19.720 --> 25:20.846
Help!

25:21.360 --> 25:22.885
Please!

25:26.120 --> 25:27.531
Hey, you okay?

25:27.720 --> 25:34.330
Need my asthma inhaler
from evidence.

25:34.520 --> 25:36.249
Please.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.286
Why don't you write your own report,
sheriff?

26:10.680 --> 26:12.409
All right, we're set.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.602
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

26:17.560 --> 26:20.484
Ten bones says Deputy Doug
had an ax to grind with his boss.

26:20.720 --> 26:22.085
How can you be so sure?

26:23.600 --> 26:26.683
- What the hell?
- Maybe we torched the wrong redneck.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.168
Or maybe not. Maybe an object
was removed from the grave.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.243
Something the Spectre's
attaching itself to.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.720
Like Bobby's flask?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.563
I don't know. You saw what I saw.
Those kids didn't take anything.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.446
- Or they did.
- And the Spectre hitched a ride with it.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.608
And whoever has the object
gets possessed.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.643
Okay. So who's got the object?

26:44.840 --> 26:47.889
And, more importantly,
who do they got a grudge against?

26:48.760 --> 26:50.603
All right. We need you to focus, deputy.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.531
Other lives depend on it.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.166
Tell me what happened
after you shot the sheriff.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.326
I was on the ground.

26:59.520 --> 27:03.605
I think Karl tackled me,
and I asked him what happened.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.200
And?

27:05.480 --> 27:07.448
He didn't answer me.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.527
He just took my gun
and walked away.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.570
Did he say where he was going?

27:13.000 --> 27:18.689
I guess I must have hurt him too.
He said he was going to the hospital.

27:22.000 --> 27:26.085
You two find out what you can about
the Unknown Soldier, I got the hospital.

27:41.120 --> 27:45.091
Hey, Sam. If you ever need to talk,
I just wanna let you know that I'm here.

27:45.280 --> 27:49.001
About anything.
You know, life, uh, Dean, you.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.326
I'm okay, thanks.

27:50.560 --> 27:54.326
It seems like you and Dean are talking,
but nobody's listening to each other.

27:54.560 --> 27:57.450
I had this cousin once,
well, he's gone now...

27:57.640 --> 27:59.324
...but his name's Frank.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.249
Frank and I...

28:06.040 --> 28:07.201
Hey.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.847
Hey. Just lock up when you leave.

28:10.080 --> 28:11.206
I'm late.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.811
Wait. What?

28:17.200 --> 28:20.921
I just think it's better
if neither of us get the wrong idea here.

28:21.640 --> 28:24.120
- Okay.
- I know I said a lot of things last night...

28:24.320 --> 28:29.360
...and I know I can't ask you
to forget them, but just do.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.366
Why?

28:31.600 --> 28:33.045
Because I don't need your pity.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.722
I don't need you looking at me
the way they all... Like that.

28:37.760 --> 28:38.921
Wait.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.240
You think this is pity?

28:42.600 --> 28:45.001
Amelia.
I'm glad you told me about Don.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.321
It helps me understand.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.807
How messed up I am?
You think I don't know that?

28:49.000 --> 28:51.844
- Don't feel sorry for me, Sam.
- I didn't mean it like that.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.050
Yeah, well, like I said, I'm late. So...

29:06.800 --> 29:08.882
', you coming?

29:21.320 --> 29:25.803
You do know there is a good reason
he's called the Unknown Soldier, right?

29:26.000 --> 29:30.528
We were hoping maybe a theory or two
had been floated around over the years.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.324
Something local, maybe?

29:32.520 --> 29:34.648
There is one.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.721
Hey, ump-

29:40.960 --> 29:43.281
You remember me? I stole second?

29:43.480 --> 29:46.450
Karl? What the hell are you doing?
Why are you doing...?

29:46.640 --> 29:49.849
Why am I gonna make mustard
from your brain stem? I don't know.

29:50.480 --> 29:52.721
Why did you call me out, ump?

29:52.920 --> 29:54.160
I'm sorry.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.688
Looks like you're shooting blanks.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.366
Hey, that tickled.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.487
Corporal Collins of the Union
shot and killed his brother, Vance...

30:12.680 --> 30:15.570
...who fought for the Confederacy.
Local boys.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.731
So two brothers fought
on opposite sides of the Civil War?

30:19.960 --> 30:22.964
Legend has it that Vance
swore vengeance on his brother...

30:23.160 --> 30:24.446
...with his dying breath.

30:25.360 --> 30:28.921
Years later, consumed by guilt,
the corporal dug his brother up...

30:29.120 --> 30:32.090
...where he'd buried him
on the battlefield, brought him home.

30:32.280 --> 30:35.170
Are you suggesting this Vance guy
is the Unknown Soldier?

30:35.360 --> 30:37.408
That's one theory, anyway.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.721
What's that?

30:40.080 --> 30:43.482
Karl, listen. I know the Spectre's turning
the temperature up in there.

30:43.680 --> 30:47.162
So just tell me what the object is
and we'll send this joker home.

30:47.400 --> 30:48.481
I don't think so.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.885
There's unfinished business,
thanks to you.

30:54.440 --> 30:57.364
Oh, the Spectre likes you.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.847
Yeah? Why don't you tell him
to come on out here?

31:00.080 --> 31:01.241
We'll make promise bracelets.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.370
Most of the soldiers
were poor farmers.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.803
So the families would give them
a penny on a string.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.047
It was for good luck.

31:13.240 --> 31:16.926
And in case they ever got lost, they
always had a penny for food or drink.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.930
A penny.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.723
Here. Have a taste.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.923
It's me. Do what you gotta.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.925
Dean. Hey. There was a string
on the floor of the tomb.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.925
It used to hold an old penny.
That's the object.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.400
We're coming right now.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.249
Dean? What the hell, man?

31:44.440 --> 31:47.808
We went to the hospital, you...
You're not answering your phone.

31:53.640 --> 31:56.211
You should have looked for me
when I was in purgatory.

33:30.880 --> 33:34.168
Come on, Dean. I know
it's not you in there pulling the strings.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.845
Shut up.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.050
Don't

33:40.800 --> 33:43.041
You never even wanted this life.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.766
Always blamed me
for pulling you back into it.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.047
That's not true.

33:47.240 --> 33:50.687
Really? Everything you've ever done
since you climbed into my ride...

33:50.920 --> 33:52.445
...has been to deceive me.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.608
What do you want me to say?

33:54.840 --> 33:56.205
That I've made mistakes?

33:56.400 --> 33:58.971
I've made mistakes, Dean.

33:59.160 --> 34:00.491
That's not Dean, Sam.

34:00.720 --> 34:01.926
Shut up!

34:03.400 --> 34:05.004
Mistakes?

34:06.720 --> 34:10.246
Well, let's go through
some of Sammy's greatest hits.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.569
Drinking demon blood, check.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.887
Being in cahoots with Ruby.

34:16.080 --> 34:19.083
Not telling me that you lost your soul.

34:19.320 --> 34:22.210
Or how about running around
with Samuel for a whole year...

34:22.400 --> 34:25.882
...letting me think you were dead
while you were doing all kinds of crazy.

34:26.120 --> 34:30.011
Those aren't mistakes, Sam,
those are choices.

34:31.239 --> 34:35.085
All right, you said it. We've both played
a little fast and loose.

34:35.280 --> 34:39.569
Yeah, I might've lied,
but I never once betrayed you.

34:41.040 --> 34:44.043
I never once left you to die.

34:44.239 --> 34:47.483
And for what? A girl?

34:47.920 --> 34:50.127
You left me to die for a girl?

35:04.560 --> 35:05.607
Oh.

35:05.800 --> 35:09.441
- Garth, don't.
- No. He won't kill me.

35:10.080 --> 35:14.404
His beef isn't with me. You're not
gonna shoot me. Are you, Dean?

35:14.640 --> 35:15.721
Move.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.291
Come on, Dean.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.642
You do not wanna kill your brother.

35:20.120 --> 35:23.408
You've been protecting him
your whole life. Don't stop now.

35:23.640 --> 35:25.369
He left me to rot in purgatory.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.365
All right, maybe he did.
I don't know, I wasn't there.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.285
- I'm sure he had his reasons.
- Like you had your reasons.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.601
For Benny.

35:33.840 --> 35:36.047
- Who?
- Benny's been more of a brother to me...

35:36.240 --> 35:39.130
...this past year
than you've ever been.

35:39.360 --> 35:40.566
That's right.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.240
Cass let me down, you let me down.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.523
The only person
that hasn't let me down is Benny.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.010
I know you're angry...

35:49.200 --> 35:52.010
...but, man, you gotta fight this thing.
Do not do this.

35:52.440 --> 35:53.521
Just let it go.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.485
Come on, Dean.

36:00.520 --> 36:01.646
Goodbye, Sam.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.648
Ow! God.

36:16.960 --> 36:19.122
Garth, don't!

36:20.160 --> 36:21.241
It's cool.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.246
It's all good. I'm cool.

36:39.360 --> 36:42.045
It took me forever to melt that penny
but it's finally gone.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.811
How come it didn't jack you
like everyone else?

36:45.000 --> 36:47.765
I can understand why it didn't affect
the kid who took it.

36:47.960 --> 36:50.122
He's young and innocent.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.800
Everyone, at some point,
feels they've been screwed.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.129
Not me, man. I let all that stuff go
with the help of my yogi...

36:56.320 --> 36:57.446
...my "Sega Genesis."

36:58.480 --> 36:59.811
And you should too.

37:00.200 --> 37:02.168
You can't change the past, amigo.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.568
Now, there's something
I wanna say to you.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.285
Stop being a idjit!

37:10.280 --> 37:13.841
With Bobby dead,
you and Sam are all each other has.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.003
And that's not so bad, man.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.804
Now, you know what's coming next,
right?

37:21.600 --> 37:23.011
- Come on.
- Yeah.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.247
Come on.

37:24.440 --> 37:26.807
Yeah. Okay.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.404
Hey, ah...

37:46.320 --> 37:48.402
Keep on trucking, Garth.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.724
Thanks.

37:51.760 --> 37:52.807
Gotta go.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.963
Yo, Lamar. What do we got?

37:58.160 --> 37:59.241
Wendigo?

37:59.600 --> 38:01.568
You got a flare gun?

38:02.600 --> 38:03.840
No?

38:04.040 --> 38:05.280
What about a flamethrower?

38:08.040 --> 38:11.601
Then you better get some sneakers
because you're gonna have to run.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.450
All right.

38:21.160 --> 38:22.241
Balls!

38:49.520 --> 38:51.124
Sam. I can't...

38:51.640 --> 38:53.449
I don't pity you. Okay?

38:54.480 --> 38:55.606
I don't.

38:57.320 --> 39:02.884
You and I, we're a lot of things,
but we're not to be pitied.

39:05.200 --> 39:09.250
Look, I lost my brother, Dean,
a few months ago.

39:10.000 --> 39:15.166
It felt like my world imploded
and came raining down on me...

39:16.160 --> 39:17.491
...and I ran.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.045
Just like you.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.002
Is that supposed to be a pep talk?

39:24.720 --> 39:27.690
Yeah. I... Sort of.

39:28.240 --> 39:30.561
Because, see, now I pity you.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.927
Oh, look, I mean,
that wasn't really my point.

39:37.120 --> 39:40.363
Yeah, well, bell's rung on that one,
so...

39:42.960 --> 39:44.849
So, uh...

39:46.400 --> 39:48.004
So, what now?

39:48.440 --> 39:51.489
I don't know.
You wanna talk about it?

39:54.000 --> 39:55.126
Last night?

39:55.400 --> 39:58.244
No, Dean, you pervert.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.050
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

40:05.080 --> 40:07.481
Do you wanna talk about Don?

40:10.920 --> 40:14.242
Hey. I'd like that too.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.684
Sammy.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.125
For the record?

40:29.480 --> 40:31.084
The girl?

40:31.320 --> 40:32.845
Her name is Amelia.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.087
Amelia Richardson.

40:34.320 --> 40:37.244
She and I had a place together
in Kermit, Texas.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.283
I don't even remember
what I said, but...

40:39.480 --> 40:41.289
But what? You didn't mean it?

40:41.480 --> 40:44.768
Please. You and I know you didn't need
that penny to say those things.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.241
- Come on, Sam.
- Own up to your crap, Dean.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.127
I told you from the jump
where I was coming from.

40:50.320 --> 40:52.482
Why I didn't look for you. But you?

40:52.720 --> 40:55.041
You had secrets. You had Benny.

40:55.440 --> 40:59.764
You got on your high and mighty and
been kicking me ever since you got back.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.849
But that's over.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.846
So move on or I will.

41:06.600 --> 41:07.931
Okay.

41:08.120 --> 41:09.610
I hear you.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.645
Good.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.242
You know what? Hear this too.

41:17.600 --> 41:21.400
I just might be that hunter that runs
into Benny one day and ices him.

41:23.800 --> 41:27.122
Well, I guess we'll cross that bridge
when we come to it, won't we?

41:28.720 --> 41:30.165
Yeah.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.761
Yeah, you keep saying that.
