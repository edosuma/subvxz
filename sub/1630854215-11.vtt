WEBVTT

00:01.479 --> 00:04.352
Mm, I love this
so much.

00:04.526 --> 00:08.399
The lake, the fir trees,
the fresh air...

00:08.573 --> 00:11.576
Good. You have
14 minutes to enjoy it.

00:11.750 --> 00:14.144
We are 4 hours and 10 minutes
away from the resort,

00:14.318 --> 00:16.886
and your Prenatal Massage and
Aura Cleansing begins at 5:45,

00:17.060 --> 00:19.628
given six rest stops
at eight minutes apiece.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.543
Wait, you've timed
my pee breaks?

00:21.717 --> 00:23.110
Generously.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.633
Shaun, we're supposed
to be relaxing.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.678
Schedules
are not relaxing.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.420
I find them...
very soothing.

00:30.073 --> 00:31.727
Okay.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.730
- 14 minutes it is.
- 13.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.734
14 is fine.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.438
Oh, that poor dog.

00:55.011 --> 00:57.361
47-year-old male,
multi-impalement, disoriented,

00:57.535 --> 00:58.884
significant blood loss.

00:59.059 --> 00:59.929
Ultrasound
and surgical tape.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.191
These spikes...

01:01.365 --> 01:03.976
Wood and metal?

01:04.151 --> 01:05.413
We-- We were
trimming trees and--

01:05.587 --> 01:07.110
and a shovel got sucked
into the wood chipper.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.982
- You work with him?
- Sometimes.
I'm-- I'm his son.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.376
I count 20 pieces.
Airway's patent,
and he's got good pulses.

01:12.550 --> 01:15.336
Lalo? He's one
of my patients.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.338
No significant free fluid
in the abdomen.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.644
No bronchospasms
or wheezing.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.212
No. Fluid's accumulating
in the pericardium.

01:22.386 --> 01:23.953
You jostle that spike,
he could bleed out.

01:24.127 --> 01:25.389
We'll have to do it
in the O.R.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.304
Dad?
Dad, can you hear me?

01:27.478 --> 01:28.392
- Aah!
- No.

01:28.566 --> 01:29.915
- No, no, no, Dad!
- Oh!

01:30.090 --> 01:31.091
- No!
- Aah!

01:31.265 --> 01:32.222
Let's get him
to the O.R.!

01:34.572 --> 01:35.878
He couldn't have
gotten far.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.401
We don't know that,

01:37.575 --> 01:39.229
and that ground
is very uneven,

01:39.403 --> 01:40.361
and we know
from experience,

01:40.535 --> 01:42.363
- the woods
can be dangerous.
- Shh.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.150
Hey, there, buddy.

01:48.543 --> 01:49.848
We're here to help.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.807
It is having
trouble breathing.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.635
Leg and multiple
rib fractures.

01:53.809 --> 01:55.245
Poor little guy.

01:55.419 --> 01:57.856
I need to reduce
the rib fractures.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.945
- Hold it steady.
- Uh, okay.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.643
Hang on, buddy.
It'll be okay.

02:05.647 --> 02:06.691
We need to get it
to a veterinary hospital.

02:18.225 --> 02:19.965
Vince?

02:36.591 --> 02:37.809
I gotta get you
to St. Bon's.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.202
I need you
to do it here.

02:39.376 --> 02:40.464
I'm a first-year resident.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.074
That's unsupervised surgery.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.728
I can't go
to the hospital.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.817
There was a gang member
at that party.

02:45.991 --> 02:48.080
Me being there was
a patrol violation.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.821
Cops get that bullet,
I'm going back to prison.

02:49.995 --> 02:51.910
Just go to your P.O.
Tell him the truth.

02:52.084 --> 02:53.869
'Cause the criminal justice
system is always fair,

02:54.043 --> 02:55.175
especially to guys
who look like me.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.618
I finally got my life
back on track.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.489
I have a good job.

03:05.663 --> 03:08.100
I'm trying to work
things out with Viva.

03:08.275 --> 03:10.320
I'm watching my baby
twice a week.

03:10.494 --> 03:11.756
I go back inside,
I could lose everything.

03:14.933 --> 03:18.981
Danni... please.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.469
All right, the bullet's
close to the surface.

03:30.688 --> 03:32.386
It's more of a procedure
than a surgery.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.694
Thank you.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.348
All right, I gotta get
some stuff first.

03:41.438 --> 03:42.439
What's the strategy?

03:42.613 --> 03:44.006
We should start

03:44.180 --> 03:45.529
with the most
life-threatening spikes--

03:45.703 --> 03:46.878
these two in the chest,
maybe the abdomen...

03:47.052 --> 03:48.706
We can't risk
a major hemorrhage so soon.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.142
Do the easier ones,

03:50.317 --> 03:51.666
buy time for
the transfusions to work.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.450
Oh.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.322
Dr. Reznick's right.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.802
We start with
the distal extremities.
I'll take his leg.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.804
You get the pieces
in his right arm.
I'll take his left.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.763
Now that there's an adult
in the room...

04:01.937 --> 04:02.981
Always a pleasure.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.809
You leaving, I mean.

04:13.731 --> 04:14.341
Hey.

04:16.908 --> 04:19.346
So, after basketball
on Wednesday,

04:19.520 --> 04:21.217
I'm introducing Clay
to the wonders of Su Cai Bao.

04:21.391 --> 04:22.653
You in?

04:22.827 --> 04:24.742
Assuming that's food, sure.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.136
Great. It's a date.
8:00 p.m. my place.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.324
Didn't you just finish
a night shift?

04:41.498 --> 04:44.022
Too much caffeine.

04:44.196 --> 04:46.024
I'm building
a trauma simulator

04:46.198 --> 04:47.374
to practice removing
foreign bodies.

04:48.723 --> 04:49.376
You're weird.

04:51.595 --> 04:52.857
You'll probably be
my boss someday.

05:03.651 --> 05:06.828
First grade, I begged
my parents for a puppy.

05:07.002 --> 05:10.832
Tessa-- chocolate Lab,
sweetest little face.

05:11.006 --> 05:14.096
Next morning, Tessa peed
on my dad's briefcase.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.403
He returned her
that night.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.535
That doesn't sound
like good parenting.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.232
It wasn't.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.539
The dog's got a damaged spleen,
broken ribs,

05:22.713 --> 05:25.977
and a fractured radius,
and skin lacerations.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.371
- He'll need--
- An ex-lap
and thoracotomy.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.895
I'm a surgeon at San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

05:31.069 --> 05:32.462
We should go.

05:32.636 --> 05:33.811
When are you
planning to do it?

05:33.985 --> 05:35.291
I'm not.

05:35.465 --> 05:36.901
I don't work without
up-front payment,

05:37.075 --> 05:38.381
and since we don't know
the dog's owners...

05:38.555 --> 05:39.948
Well, we'll pay.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.167
That...
could be expensive.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.561
Quite.

05:44.735 --> 05:45.910
I could slot him
in tomorrow morning.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.395
Well, I guess we could
stay in a motel?

05:52.569 --> 05:53.657
I mean, we should really
be here for Buddy.

05:53.831 --> 05:54.789
I've named him Buddy.

05:57.182 --> 05:59.968
Whatever
its real name is,

06:00.142 --> 06:02.318
it is a dog
and not our dog.

06:02.492 --> 06:05.452
And we are going to miss
your Prenatal Massage.

06:05.626 --> 06:06.931
Buddy needs us more than I need
my aura cleansed, Shaun.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.066
Okay.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.589
It is your babymoon.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.209
Ready?

06:31.913 --> 06:33.480
It's just a fragment.

06:33.654 --> 06:34.872
The bullet must have shattered.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.221
- It's still in me?
- Yeah.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.270
There's damage
deeper in your leg.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.664
I can't locate
the rest of the bullet

06:43.838 --> 06:45.579
unless I cut further
in your muscle.

06:45.753 --> 06:46.710
So cut.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.454
I need a second opinion.

06:51.628 --> 06:52.934
Hey.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.544
Question--
if a bullet's stuck

06:54.718 --> 06:55.937
behind
the vastus medialis...

06:56.111 --> 06:57.678
This for your simulator?

06:57.852 --> 06:59.419
<i>Yeah, it's a scenario
I'm practicing.</i>

06:59.593 --> 07:02.509
Um, how do you decide
if you leave it in?

07:02.683 --> 07:04.119
Well, it depends
on the imaging.

07:04.293 --> 07:06.730
<i>What if you're
going in blind?</i>

07:06.904 --> 07:09.037
Well, it depends
on the angle of entry,

07:09.211 --> 07:11.474
caliber of the bullet,
exact location.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.084
Okay.
I'll figure it out.

07:14.521 --> 07:15.522
Danni...

07:17.524 --> 07:18.873
how about you tell me
what's actually going on?

07:22.920 --> 07:25.270
Removing the left
lateral mid-thigh spike.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.924
Irrigating the spike
near the sternum.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.665
No signs
of pneumothorax.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.014
Starting on the shoulder.

07:32.147 --> 07:33.409
- Lost the pulse.
He's in V-tach.
- Get the internal paddles.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.105
Setting up
the internal paddles.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.588
He's coding.
Where are those paddles?

07:38.762 --> 07:40.721
Almost ready.

07:40.895 --> 07:43.027
There's no time.
Starting cardiac massage.

07:44.725 --> 07:45.726
Push 1 milligram epi.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.566
We've got sinus rhythm.

07:59.740 --> 08:00.871
Blood pressure's
normalizing.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.046
Good job, Dr. Park.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.962
I'll do more
sharp dissection.

08:05.136 --> 08:06.834
His body
can't take any more.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.966
We'll get a panscan CT, CTA,
transfuse him,

08:09.140 --> 08:09.924
and resume
in the morning.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.537
Nine spikes down,
11 to go.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.934
<i>Definitely landed
in the medial compartment.</i>

08:20.108 --> 08:21.501
<i>Blood flow?</i>

08:21.675 --> 08:24.025
Good pulses.
Intact nerve function
in the leg.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.462
If he was in the O.R.,
we'd leave the bullet in.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.246
<i>Got it.
Thank you.</i>

08:28.420 --> 08:30.031
I'll pack the wound
and send him home.

08:30.205 --> 08:31.075
<i>Hold on.
Can you take me off video?</i>

08:34.992 --> 08:37.517
Yeah, I'm not a big fan
of being lied to.

08:37.691 --> 08:40.084
It won't happen again.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.303
Thanks, Asher.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.614
There's... a stain
on the floor.

08:48.571 --> 08:49.616
Mmm.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.493
Now there's a pillow
on the floor.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.234
Yeah, they should really
clean that carpet.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.104
Let me call
the front desk.

09:02.019 --> 09:05.501
Ugh, it's sticky!

09:05.675 --> 09:08.373
Okay, maybe--
maybe I overreacted.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.027
You did.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.639
I-- I thought
you loved animals.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.728
I love rabbits and fish.

09:14.902 --> 09:16.338
They don't slobber or jump
on you or make messes.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.035
Well, you know, Shaun,

09:18.209 --> 09:19.733
someone's about to come
into our life

09:19.907 --> 09:22.387
who's going to slobber
and jump on us and make messes.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.694
If you are talking
about our son--

09:24.868 --> 09:26.130
Yes, of course,
I'm talking about our son.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.265
Sorry.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.833
Clearly, we are
both stressed.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.096
I don't think
I'm stressed.

09:35.270 --> 09:36.576
Fine.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.839
Only I am.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.580
And tired.

09:40.754 --> 09:43.887
And... I'm gonna
get ready for bed.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.761
Ew!

10:06.606 --> 10:07.824
Something's wrong.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.574
That's infected.

10:18.748 --> 10:21.098
If I don't get the rest
of the bullet out,
you're gonna go septic.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.622
So you can
do it here, right?

10:24.754 --> 10:25.537
I shouldn't.

10:27.104 --> 10:29.063
You got me this far.

10:29.237 --> 10:30.194
Please.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.679
Okay. I'm gonna
need some help.

10:39.029 --> 10:40.248
During the surgery,
we discovered

10:40.422 --> 10:41.945
sacral and lumbar fractures.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.338
What does that mean?

10:43.512 --> 10:45.340
The dog will have
trouble walking

10:45.514 --> 10:47.211
and will be incontinent.

10:48.735 --> 10:50.388
So...

10:50.562 --> 10:51.868
a second surgery?

10:52.042 --> 10:53.478
Unlikely to be effective.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.134
The dog would still be at risk
for infections, UTIs,

10:57.308 --> 10:59.789
and will require
constant care.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.183
Euthanasia
would be more humane.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.619
We brought this dog here
to save him,

11:03.793 --> 11:04.751
not have him put down.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.973
I'm gonna find his family.

11:10.147 --> 11:13.281
And if I can't,
I will find him a new family.

11:13.455 --> 11:17.415
And you're gonna find a surgery
to fix his incontinence.

11:17.589 --> 11:21.985
Dr. Sinclair is the expert
in veterinary medicine.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.205
If he cannot think of
an effective surgery

11:24.379 --> 11:26.076
for incontinence,
there probably isn't one.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.904
In which case,
it's very unlikely

11:28.078 --> 11:29.732
the dog
will be adopted.

11:29.906 --> 11:30.733
Then we'll adopt him.

11:32.648 --> 11:35.303
I will find a surgery.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.485
Hey.
Where are the supplies?

11:43.659 --> 11:45.008
I didn't bring them.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.227
Danni, you shouldn't
be doing this.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.315
This is straight-up
surgery.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.012
Go home.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.797
Let me help you take him
back to the hospital.

11:50.971 --> 11:52.494
- That's not happening.
- Why not?

11:52.668 --> 11:54.235
If you weren't gonna do this,
why'd you even come?

11:54.409 --> 11:56.367
Because I-- I didn't want
to desert you.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.979
So don't.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.068
I'll go get
the supplies myself.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.373
I just need you
to talk me through it.

12:04.811 --> 12:05.899
You won't even
have to touch him.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.120
If this ever gets out,
I'll take the fall.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.953
This is why he went
into V-tach.

12:17.127 --> 12:18.215
The spike in his shoulder damaged

12:18.389 --> 12:20.435
every critical structure
in the area.

12:20.609 --> 12:23.046
We need to do a carotid
to subclavian bypass
before we pull it out.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.395
Risks sending him
into V-tach again.

12:24.569 --> 12:25.570
Well, we need
to remove the spike.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.746
Unless we remove his arm.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.967
In his current condition,
it's a less risky surgery.

12:31.141 --> 12:33.753
Comes down to what Lalo's
willing to risk.

12:33.927 --> 12:36.059
And we can't ask him
because he's too unstable

12:36.233 --> 12:38.061
to take him off
the ventilator.

12:38.235 --> 12:38.932
We could ask his son.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.370
He's 16.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.154
He's not authorized
to make medical decisions.

12:44.328 --> 12:45.634
Sure, but he'd have
a better idea than us

12:45.808 --> 12:46.417
what his father
would want.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.205
Talk to him.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.260
Oh, Buddy.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.088
It's okay.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.308
We're gonna find your humans.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.485
Are you okay?

13:10.659 --> 13:12.008
Yep. All good.

13:12.182 --> 13:14.619
Were you trying
to pet the dog?

13:14.794 --> 13:17.709
No. Mmm-mmm.

13:17.884 --> 13:21.017
You should never touch
an injured animal
near its wound.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.193
I know.

13:23.367 --> 13:25.065
I'm gonna start putting up
lost dog fliers.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.377
Making the incision.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.383
Dissecting at the muscle
to free up the purulence.

13:45.259 --> 13:45.955
What's her name?

13:47.783 --> 13:49.132
Lila.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.264
What's she like?

13:52.657 --> 13:56.183
The first time she saw snow,
she ran outside--

13:56.357 --> 13:58.707
no gloves, no hat.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.318
I-I had to drag her back in
before she--

14:01.492 --> 14:02.406
before she turned blue.

14:06.019 --> 14:09.718
She's like me--
never listens to anyone.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.372
Mmm.

14:11.546 --> 14:12.895
Sounds like Powell, actually.

14:17.682 --> 14:20.903
I know I can be...
a bit much.

14:23.297 --> 14:26.213
My parents
were really tough.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.998
I learned at a young age
that if I didn't push back,

14:29.172 --> 14:31.435
hard, that I'd be
pushed around.

14:33.307 --> 14:34.525
So it helped me,

14:34.699 --> 14:37.485
especially
after I lost my leg.

14:37.659 --> 14:40.401
My med school advisor told me
that I shouldn't be a surgeon

14:40.575 --> 14:42.446
because I wouldn't be able to
stand for hours in the O.R.

14:43.578 --> 14:44.927
But I can.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.015
And I am.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.542
Danni, are you okay?

14:51.716 --> 14:53.675
It's Audrey.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.764
I called
out of my shift this morning.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.984
I just told her it was
a family emergency.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.465
Oh, she's been calling
and texting.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.598
This is not good.
This is not good.

15:03.772 --> 15:04.947
I know.

15:06.209 --> 15:06.906
Wait, wait, wait!
Where are you--

15:07.080 --> 15:08.472
Just, shh. Just...

15:12.737 --> 15:14.696
- Hey.
- Hey, is everything okay?

15:14.870 --> 15:18.221
Yeah, yeah, a good friend's
having some issues.

15:18.395 --> 15:19.657
We're still
in the middle of it.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.355
Oh.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.139
After what happened with Perez,
I was worried.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.054
Just wanted
to check on you.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.752
Thanks.
I totally get it.

15:27.927 --> 15:28.971
- You'll be in tomorrow?
- Yeah.

15:31.365 --> 15:32.714
What was that?

15:40.852 --> 15:41.941
Hey.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.034
If we remove the spike
from your dad's shoulder,

15:48.208 --> 15:49.600
it could cause complications
that would kill him.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.040
How likely?

15:54.214 --> 15:56.999
Maybe a 5% to 10% chance.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.393
The safer option would be
to amputate the arm.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.702
So you're asking
me to decide

16:04.876 --> 16:06.269
whether to cut off
my dad's arm?

16:06.443 --> 16:08.837
No, we're not.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.621
We just want to figure out
what your dad would want

16:10.795 --> 16:12.101
if he was awake.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.715
Do you have any other
support system?

16:17.889 --> 16:19.152
Family, friends
who help out?

16:20.675 --> 16:23.373
Not really.

16:23.547 --> 16:26.898
Mom died, and the rest
of the family's in El Salvador.

16:27.073 --> 16:29.118
Has he ever worked
with other gardeners?

16:29.292 --> 16:32.774
I mean, me.
I help out most mornings
before school.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.995
Um, he fell off a roof
last winter.

16:36.169 --> 16:38.127
Got a concussion.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.477
I picked up some slack,
and it was fine.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.044
I-I know
this is different,

16:44.046 --> 16:47.093
but he always says, "We stick
together, we'll find a way."

16:52.141 --> 16:54.578
If cutting off his arm
means he'll live...

16:55.753 --> 16:56.798
then do it.

16:58.756 --> 16:59.888
That's what he'd want.

17:07.069 --> 17:09.071
Why are you talking to me
about operating on a dog?

17:09.245 --> 17:10.594
Lea asked me to.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.467
She is very stressed,
and I don't know why.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.991
Well, considering what
she's been through, you know?

17:16.165 --> 17:18.994
But she knows her pregnancy
is safe now.

17:19.168 --> 17:22.345
Well, you don't get
over something like that
in-- in a week.

17:22.519 --> 17:25.566
Okay, s-so how much time
will she need?

17:25.740 --> 17:27.350
<i>I don't know, Shaun.</i>

17:27.524 --> 17:29.961
Maybe this isn't even
the main issue, you know?

17:30.136 --> 17:32.051
Mmm.

17:32.225 --> 17:36.403
Maybe Lea is worried
about being a mom?

17:36.577 --> 17:37.708
<i>Well, she wouldn't
be the first.</i>

17:37.882 --> 17:39.667
Aren't you a little bit worried
about being a dad?

17:39.841 --> 17:41.147
A little.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.280
Crying babies
can be very loud,

17:44.454 --> 17:45.803
and their bowel movements
and spit-up

17:45.977 --> 17:48.328
can be very disgusting
and smelly.

17:48.502 --> 17:50.982
But I have
noise-reducing earplugs

17:51.157 --> 17:52.854
and peppermint oil
for under my nose.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.726
<i>And I will keep a supply
of surgical smocks at home.</i>

17:55.900 --> 17:57.989
You've certainly
gamed that out, huh?

17:58.164 --> 18:01.167
Yes. How do I help Lea
be less worried?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.343
I don't know, Shaun.

18:03.517 --> 18:06.041
You don't know
what the issue is, right?

18:06.215 --> 18:07.825
So I would talk to her

18:07.999 --> 18:09.653
<i>and tell her
that you've noticed</i>

18:09.827 --> 18:10.959
<i>she's been a little bit
stressed lately,</i>

18:11.133 --> 18:12.091
<i>and ask her
what's going on.</i>

18:13.570 --> 18:15.006
And send me
the doggy imaging.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.285
He's stable, for now.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.200
I'm so sorry.
- You should be.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.462
If you're gonna blame anybody,
blame me.

18:35.636 --> 18:38.421
Oh, I do.
This was unethical, stupid,

18:38.595 --> 18:40.423
and if he dies,
possibly criminal.

18:42.773 --> 18:44.210
Vince would've died
of sepsis.

18:44.384 --> 18:45.689
- So call an ambulance.
- Then what?

18:45.863 --> 18:47.648
EMTs can't force him
to go to the hospital.

18:47.822 --> 18:49.128
They can if he's
unconscious.

18:49.302 --> 18:50.390
But he could be dead
by then.

18:52.435 --> 18:55.003
The only way to make sure
that he lives

18:55.177 --> 18:56.831
is to operate here.

18:57.005 --> 19:00.269
You're a trauma surgeon.
It would be simple and ethical.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.271
- Who is this guy?
- I told you.

19:02.445 --> 19:04.143
He's a friend of mine
from the Navy.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.057
Who's on parole...
for what?

19:08.973 --> 19:10.149
- That doesn't matter.
- Does to me.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.461
Vince was the first one
to the accident.

19:18.635 --> 19:19.723
He tourniqueted my leg.

19:21.856 --> 19:24.467
He held my hand.
He comforted me.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.643
He was the only person
that day

19:26.817 --> 19:28.471
that looked me
straight in the eyes.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.473
Everybody else
was just too scared,

19:30.647 --> 19:32.736
too freaked out...
too disgusted.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.352
I'm sorry.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.184
Will you give us a second?

19:52.016 --> 19:53.409
If I hadn't warned you
off of that surgery

19:53.583 --> 19:56.064
four months ago,

19:56.238 --> 19:58.675
you could've ended up worse off
or dead on the table.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.417
And whether you knew it
or not,

20:01.591 --> 20:02.766
you needed me.

20:05.247 --> 20:07.597
Right now, Audrey,
I need you.

20:12.123 --> 20:14.604
I will help you
with your friend.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.519
And then we'll deal
with what you did.

20:27.487 --> 20:28.966
I put up
tons of fliers,

20:29.140 --> 20:30.272
called around
to all the shelters

20:30.446 --> 20:33.232
and vet hospitals and...

20:33.406 --> 20:36.235
- Did Glassman have ideas
at least?
- Yes.

20:36.409 --> 20:37.801
That I should
talk to you.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.716
I've noticed
you are stressed,

20:39.890 --> 20:41.631
and I don't know
exactly why,

20:41.805 --> 20:43.807
but maybe it is because you are
worried about motherhood.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.377
I meant about the surgery
for the dog.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.382
But... I am worried, yeah.

20:55.776 --> 20:58.518
You shouldn't be.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.476
You'll be great.

21:00.650 --> 21:04.175
Thanks.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.613
And I know you'll be
a great dad to our son,

21:06.787 --> 21:11.008
but what if we're
incompatible as parents?

21:11.182 --> 21:13.881
We can't even agree
how to wash dishes.

21:14.055 --> 21:15.752
And look at us
with this dog.

21:15.926 --> 21:18.015
We're arguing.
Buddy hates me.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.018
I lied.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.282
He snapped at me after I petted
too close to his stitches.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.806
I thought so.

21:25.980 --> 21:30.637
We will work as a team
and figure it out.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.948
But... what if we
don't know how?

21:38.122 --> 21:41.300
We've both had pretty lousy
parental role models.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.259
I don't think I'm like
my parents at all.

21:44.433 --> 21:46.348
And I don't plan
to treat our children

21:46.522 --> 21:48.437
like they did
me and Steve.

21:48.611 --> 21:51.875
I can see my parents in me
in ways I really don't like.

21:52.049 --> 21:56.315
I can be stubborn like my dad
and flaky like my mom.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.665
I can't tell you
how many times

21:58.839 --> 22:00.231
I was the last kid
at after-school

22:00.406 --> 22:01.363
because she forgot
to pick me up.

22:04.584 --> 22:05.889
What if I mess up
like they did?

22:10.416 --> 22:13.854
You probably will
mess up sometimes,

22:14.028 --> 22:17.988
in those ways--
other ways, too.

22:18.162 --> 22:21.078
I probably will
as well.

22:21.252 --> 22:26.040
But we will support
each other and each...

22:40.402 --> 22:41.621
I know how to help
the dog.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.321
I'm gonna inject
more lidocaine.

22:49.150 --> 22:49.933
Turn on the ultrasound probe.

22:57.332 --> 22:58.289
How'd you end up
in prison?

23:01.728 --> 23:04.339
When I got back from
Afghanistan, I couldn't sleep.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.036
I would lie in bed
just staring at the door

23:06.210 --> 23:07.951
waiting for someone
to come at me and...

23:10.998 --> 23:12.739
I-I was in a bar,

23:12.913 --> 23:14.393
and I thought
some guy looked at me wrong.

23:15.611 --> 23:16.482
Are you getting help?

23:19.180 --> 23:21.748
I'm on meds, in therapy.

23:25.665 --> 23:28.189
I don't want to be
what I was.

23:28.363 --> 23:31.235
I want to be a good man
for my family.

23:34.108 --> 23:34.978
I don't see
the bullet.

23:36.980 --> 23:37.807
It must have migrated.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.726
Three centimeters deep
and medial to the femur

23:43.900 --> 23:44.988
in the adductor magnus.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.555
And what does that mean?

23:46.729 --> 23:47.600
It's harder
to get to now.

23:51.908 --> 23:52.735
We can do it.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.262
This'll hurt.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.004
Aah!

24:01.178 --> 24:02.441
Let's amputate.
Book the O.R.

24:02.615 --> 24:03.790
On it.

24:05.226 --> 24:06.009
I think we should
save the arm.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.231
Did you not hear
what Dylan just said?

24:10.405 --> 24:13.103
I heard a son
who'll do anything
to make sure his dad lives.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.323
But that's not necessarily
what the dad would want.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.804
Lalo's a poor, undocumented
manual laborer.

24:17.978 --> 24:19.545
No support system.

24:19.719 --> 24:21.329
If he can't work as a gardener,
then what?

24:21.503 --> 24:24.375
Dylan told us what.
They'll find a way.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.247
And Dylan will drop out
of school to take care of him.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.597
He just told us how he works
for his dad most mornings.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.469
Already took care of him
when he had a concussion.

24:30.643 --> 24:33.820
The future Lalo spent building
his son would disappear.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.909
You know what else
would ruin his future?

24:36.083 --> 24:37.476
Having a dead dad.

24:40.609 --> 24:41.567
Lalo would
take the risk.

24:45.962 --> 24:47.398
Morgan heard everything
you did

24:47.573 --> 24:48.269
and came away
with a different impression.

24:48.443 --> 24:49.139
She's not a parent.

24:51.141 --> 24:52.055
That's very patronizing.

24:55.929 --> 24:56.538
But that doesn't mean
he's wrong.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.543
- You're confident
you can save his arm?
- Very.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.895
Then let's do it.

25:11.988 --> 25:13.163
What a dick move.

25:15.252 --> 25:17.516
I am so sick of being told
that childless people

25:17.690 --> 25:19.430
can't understand
what it means to love someone.

25:19.605 --> 25:22.042
There's love and then
there's being a parent.

25:22.216 --> 25:23.565
In nine months or so,
you'll get it.

25:27.569 --> 25:30.093
After drilling the lamina
from L4 to S1,

25:30.267 --> 25:32.313
we will use
a Kerrison punch

25:32.487 --> 25:34.533
to remove fragments
2 millimeters at a time,

25:34.707 --> 25:37.144
then support the spine
with screws and rods.

25:37.318 --> 25:39.059
And that
is how we will fix

25:39.233 --> 25:41.278
the incontinence
and leg weakness.

25:41.452 --> 25:42.976
And by we, I mean you.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.936
A little outside
my wheelhouse.

25:47.110 --> 25:47.981
That's why they
called in the bullpen.

25:49.939 --> 25:52.376
Ah, yes.
You're an expert... on humans.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.162
I'm still very unsure.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.119
Why can't you just
do the surgery?

25:58.469 --> 26:02.125
Buddy is an innocent little guy
who really needs our help.

26:02.299 --> 26:04.301
And I've put in a ton of work
with Shaun and Dr. Glassman

26:04.475 --> 26:06.129
to find a way
that could save him.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.741
And-- And I recognize
you have valid questions.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.439
And I know, my hormones
are probably playing
a role right now,

26:11.613 --> 26:13.615
and my attachment to a dog
I met yesterday

26:13.789 --> 26:16.052
probably doesn't make sense
to you, but it is real.

26:16.226 --> 26:18.968
And I really need
Buddy to be okay.

26:19.142 --> 26:21.449
So I'm asking you to please
set aside your concerns

26:21.623 --> 26:22.972
and please help us
help Buddy.

26:27.020 --> 26:29.109
Who's paying for this?

26:29.283 --> 26:30.545
Um...

26:36.246 --> 26:37.508
Seriously?

26:37.683 --> 26:38.858
Gah!

26:39.032 --> 26:40.599
I need longer forceps.

26:40.773 --> 26:43.036
- God.
- We're almost there.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.907
No.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.170
Vince? Vince!

26:51.044 --> 26:52.175
It's cold.

26:55.962 --> 26:57.746
Poor pulses.

26:57.920 --> 26:58.965
The fragment must have caused
a thrombosis.

27:01.097 --> 27:02.446
I'm calling it.
Push more fluids.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.759
I need an ambulance
at 302 West Holden Drive,
Apartment 2A.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.199
We're gonna try to save
your dad's arm.

27:18.811 --> 27:21.335
- Did-- Did something
get better?
- No.

27:21.509 --> 27:23.685
But we decided
it's worth the risk.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.561
Why did you even
ask me then?

27:30.736 --> 27:33.347
So I could screw up
and make the wrong decision?

27:33.521 --> 27:35.610
You didn't screw up.

27:35.784 --> 27:38.787
He hasn't taken
a weekend off in six years.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.618
He-- He wears old clothes
so I can have new ones
for school.

27:46.926 --> 27:50.625
He's given up his whole life
t-to make sure I'm--

27:50.799 --> 27:54.237
I'm happy and healthy
and safe.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.895
- I'm just trying
to help him and...
- You did.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.465
You gave us
the information we needed.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.686
Right.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.171
Ten-blade.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.043
Twenty's better.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.175
You worried about a scar?
It's a dog.

28:19.349 --> 28:20.960
Dogs like scars, actually.

28:21.134 --> 28:23.223
They think it makes them
look cool.

28:23.397 --> 28:25.573
A Veterinary Medical Review
longitudinal study

28:25.747 --> 28:27.662
showed that post-op
recovery outcomes--

28:27.836 --> 28:29.838
Shaun, the man knows
how to cut into a dog.

28:30.012 --> 28:32.580
But he may not have read
the study, which--

28:32.754 --> 28:34.321
I've already made
the incision...

28:34.495 --> 28:37.019
with a ten-blade.

28:37.193 --> 28:39.282
Preparing to place
the 3 millimeter pedicle screw.

28:40.980 --> 28:43.286
A 5 millimeter
screw's better.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.553
Removing the bullet.

28:53.644 --> 28:54.950
Slowly release
the proximal clamp

28:55.124 --> 28:56.299
and let's
look for flow.

29:03.393 --> 29:05.134
It's good flow.

29:05.308 --> 29:07.267
Vascular repair's hemostatic.

29:07.441 --> 29:10.661
Let's finish this up
and get him off to recovery.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.576
Bag the bullet
for forensic evidence.

29:31.465 --> 29:32.335
Hey.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.512
How'd it go?

29:35.686 --> 29:37.819
We won't know
until he wakes up.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.781
It meant a lot
that you came.

29:42.955 --> 29:44.478
How can you say no
to a dog?

29:46.262 --> 29:47.394
Yeah.

29:52.312 --> 29:55.358
You know, when Maddie
was a newborn...

29:55.532 --> 29:58.144
we were worried
that she wasn't...

29:58.318 --> 29:59.362
latching on, you know?

30:00.711 --> 30:02.888
But she did.

30:03.062 --> 30:05.325
And then we were worried
that she wasn't crawling,

30:05.499 --> 30:07.153
and she did.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.329
And then we were worried
she wasn't talking,

30:09.503 --> 30:10.373
and...

30:12.201 --> 30:14.029
You're gonna be a mom.

30:14.203 --> 30:17.337
You're gonna worry,
that goes with the gig.

30:17.511 --> 30:20.253
99% of the time,
everything works out just fine.

30:30.002 --> 30:33.048
What was Maddie like?

30:37.792 --> 30:39.011
Maddie...

30:42.014 --> 30:43.885
She never walked anywhere,
she always ran.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.717
She was angry... a lot.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.458
That was her default.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.637
But she loved
so deeply.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.989
It was like you were
the only one in the world.

31:03.818 --> 31:05.298
I wish I'd known her.

31:08.127 --> 31:09.519
Why'd you ask me
about Maddie?

31:11.739 --> 31:14.002
I just can't imagine

31:14.176 --> 31:15.917
going through
what you went through.

31:18.528 --> 31:22.445
And I am... so scared...

31:22.619 --> 31:24.186
of that 1%.

31:32.194 --> 31:36.416
After Maddie died, I didn't
think that I was gonna make it.

31:36.590 --> 31:39.201
There were times that I hoped
that I wouldn't.

31:41.247 --> 31:42.465
But I did.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.427
And then I met Shaun.
And then I met you.

31:47.601 --> 31:48.950
And I'm grateful
every single day

31:49.124 --> 31:50.734
because I love you both
so much.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.739
You and Shaun have love,

31:55.914 --> 31:58.525
and you have faith
in each other.

31:58.699 --> 32:01.484
If I was a betting man...

32:01.658 --> 32:04.052
I would bet the house
on the both of you.

32:20.503 --> 32:23.028
We're on full flow.
Removing the spike.

32:30.383 --> 32:31.514
Low blood flow
to the brain.

32:31.688 --> 32:32.515
How's the NIRS?

32:32.689 --> 32:33.908
61%.

32:34.082 --> 32:35.518
Graft must have
caused an obstruction.

32:35.692 --> 32:36.215
I can fix it. Clamps.

32:38.434 --> 32:40.132
11-blade
and 6-0 prolene.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.440
NIRS?

32:44.614 --> 32:46.051
56%.
Dropping fast.

32:46.225 --> 32:48.096
Below 50,
he risks brain damage.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.272
We should call this off
and ligate the subclavian.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.971
No. We're this close
to saving his arm.

32:53.145 --> 32:54.494
- More sutures.
- 52%.

32:54.668 --> 32:57.497
Dr. Park?

32:57.671 --> 32:59.064
Dr. Park.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.500
Get ready to flush
and unclamp.

33:00.674 --> 33:02.241
Go.

33:02.415 --> 33:04.417
- Starting flush.
- Unclamping.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.120
Arm's pink.

33:12.294 --> 33:13.078
NIRS at 70%
and climbing.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.298
10 spikes to go.

33:24.524 --> 33:29.442
If the surgery fails
and he is still incontinent...

33:31.487 --> 33:35.143
I found a waterproof dog bed
he might like.

33:36.666 --> 33:37.841
For our place?

33:39.234 --> 33:41.193
Buddy is...

33:43.064 --> 33:44.457
very calming to pet.

33:47.373 --> 33:48.765
Oh.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.245
I think
he needs to pee.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.160
We need to get him
to the pad.

33:52.334 --> 33:53.596
Hey, Buddy,
you gotta hold it in

33:53.770 --> 33:55.120
until we get you
over there.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.426
- Okay, not yet, Buddy.
- Almost there, Buddy.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.253
No pee pee.-Keep holding it in.

33:58.427 --> 34:00.734
Not yet, no pee pee.

34:00.908 --> 34:03.171
- Almost there.
- Keep holding it in.

34:03.345 --> 34:04.259
There we go.
All right.

34:04.433 --> 34:05.869
Time for urination.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.741
Go pee pee.

34:07.915 --> 34:09.264
- Okay, oh.
- Oh, oh!

34:10.918 --> 34:11.614
He did it.

34:11.788 --> 34:14.008
Oh, we did it.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.054
- We got him to pee.
- We did it.

34:16.228 --> 34:18.665
Oh, oh.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.275
Oh, good boy.

34:25.237 --> 34:27.326
I'm thinking
letters in their records,

34:27.500 --> 34:29.415
remediation plans,

34:29.589 --> 34:31.765
and a two-month probationary
direct supervision.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.419
One more misstep,
they're out.

34:33.593 --> 34:34.637
That's appropriate...

34:35.943 --> 34:38.206
for Asher.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.382
It's not easy to draw a line
between what they did.

34:40.556 --> 34:41.688
Asher never picked up
an instrument

34:41.862 --> 34:43.429
until you were
supervising him.

34:43.603 --> 34:46.693
And Powell has shown
a pattern of disobedience

34:46.867 --> 34:48.042
even from
her first surgery.

34:50.131 --> 34:51.611
Wolke's made mistakes
of his own.

34:51.785 --> 34:53.091
And he knows that.

34:53.265 --> 34:54.222
Does Powell?

34:59.140 --> 35:01.664
Listen, your department,
your call.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.971
But you almost lost Shaun
as a friend this year.

35:04.145 --> 35:06.974
And I'm worried
you're acting out of fear
of losing another.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.679
Color looks good.

35:17.724 --> 35:18.986
Strong radial pulse.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.207
Now I want you to try
to move your fingers,

35:22.381 --> 35:23.512
very slow,
just a little.

35:23.686 --> 35:25.253
Okay.

35:31.433 --> 35:32.434
Is that good?

35:32.608 --> 35:34.784
It's great.

35:34.958 --> 35:36.960
<i>Muchas gracias,</i> Doctor.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.527
You saved my life.

35:43.097 --> 35:44.359
What's wrong?

35:49.712 --> 35:50.670
Um, they-- they asked me
what you would--

35:50.844 --> 35:52.411
you know,
about your arm.

36:00.549 --> 36:01.420
I told them
to amputate.

36:04.553 --> 36:06.164
I made
the wrong choice.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.775
<i>Mijo,</i> whatever you did,

36:08.949 --> 36:10.385
you were there for me.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.998
I've never been
so proud of you.

36:27.881 --> 36:29.230
I love you, too.

36:31.363 --> 36:33.539
So, I started looking
for dog walkers.

36:33.713 --> 36:36.498
They're not cheap,
but what is, so...

36:36.672 --> 36:39.545
Cooper!

36:39.719 --> 36:42.678
<i>♪ I've been going
through the motions ♪</i>

36:42.852 --> 36:44.811
You're Lea?
We just saw the flier.

36:44.985 --> 36:47.117
We have been searching
for days.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.294
We will, of course,
pay you back
for any expenses.

36:49.468 --> 36:52.862
Good.
It's $22,563.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.997
Yeah, we could work
something out.

36:57.171 --> 37:00.000
<i>♪ Maybe it's just a phase,
but regardless ♪</i>

37:00.174 --> 37:04.483
<i>♪ I'm flipping the pages,
pages ♪</i>

37:12.055 --> 37:14.319
You saved the arm.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.495
Guess you were right.

37:16.669 --> 37:18.018
Or I was lucky.

37:18.192 --> 37:20.020
I almost lost him.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.284
Well, you didn't.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.382
Yeah, I think I pushed too hard
on this surgery.

37:36.428 --> 37:39.387
And I definitely said things
to you that weren't fair.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.657
Last week
Kellan told me

37:48.831 --> 37:50.659
he wasn't coming home
for the holidays.

37:50.833 --> 37:52.487
Going on a trip
with his roommates.

37:55.925 --> 37:56.839
Feels like
I'm losing him.

37:59.712 --> 38:00.843
Like I've been
a crappy father.

38:02.758 --> 38:04.064
You're not.

38:07.328 --> 38:10.331
Anyway... I'm sorry.

38:15.771 --> 38:17.599
My implantation failed.

38:19.906 --> 38:21.560
It's been, what,
nine days?

38:21.734 --> 38:23.562
Blood tests wouldn't
be fully accurate.

38:23.736 --> 38:27.566
I could feel
I was pregnant...

38:27.740 --> 38:30.351
and...

38:30.525 --> 38:32.005
then I wasn't.

38:32.179 --> 38:33.136
I'll be here.

38:35.487 --> 38:36.444
Anytime
you need a friend.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.320
I just might.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.417
Probation.

38:52.591 --> 38:53.461
I'm sorry.

39:06.169 --> 39:06.996
We're letting you go
from the program.

39:13.612 --> 39:15.744
What about Vince?

39:15.918 --> 39:17.877
If you have any leeway
not to report him...

39:18.051 --> 39:19.139
The bullet
was misplaced.

39:20.532 --> 39:21.837
Misplaced?

39:22.011 --> 39:24.449
So I don't see the point
in alerting the police.

39:27.800 --> 39:28.931
Thank you.

39:34.197 --> 39:36.417
Danni,
this wasn't an easy call.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.728
You gotta learn
to compromise sometimes.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.120
If you don't,
it's gonna hurt you,

39:44.294 --> 39:45.948
not just as a doctor,
but in life.

39:50.692 --> 39:51.954
I'm sorry it worked
out this way.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.175
I'm not.

39:58.091 --> 39:59.701
If I'd done
anything else,

39:59.875 --> 40:02.400
Vince would be dead
or headed back to prison.

40:02.574 --> 40:05.620
And either way, his family
would be destroyed.

40:05.794 --> 40:09.102
So I did
the right thing.

40:09.276 --> 40:10.625
I'll live with
the consequences.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.195
Good luck.

40:17.066 --> 40:19.112
You, too.

40:30.645 --> 40:33.126
I'm gonna miss you, Buddy.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.693
Cooper.

40:34.867 --> 40:36.434
But I'll write you
every week.

40:36.608 --> 40:39.785
- He won't get it.
- I was kidding.

40:39.959 --> 40:41.743
You're a good boy.

40:41.917 --> 40:44.790
Look, I know
everyone says this to you,

40:44.964 --> 40:47.183
but I really mean it.
