00:03.469 --> 00:05.074
<i>You are being watched.</i>

00:06.039 --> 00:08.246
<i>The government
has a secret system.</i>
<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:08.408 --> 00:11.685
<i>A machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.</i>

00:12.713 --> 00:14.920
<i>I designed the machine
to detect acts of terror,</i>

00:15.082 --> 00:16.755
<i>but it sees everything.</i>

00:16.917 --> 00:19.397
<i>Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:23.164
<i>The government considers
these people irrelevant.</i>

00:23.323 --> 00:24.666
<i>We don't.</i>

00:25.425 --> 00:29.032
<i>Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.</i>

00:29.930 --> 00:31.432
<i>You will never find us.</i>

00:31.765 --> 00:33.870
<i>But victim or perpetrator,</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:36.742
<i>if your number's up,
we'll find you.</i>

00:40.340 --> 00:42.877
<i>You won't believe what The Swede
has been doing.</i>

00:42.943 --> 00:44.445
<i>Going to the therapy.</i>

00:44.611 --> 00:46.522
<i>How much
does the therapist know?</i>

00:50.784 --> 00:52.764
Are you resting comfortably?

00:53.020 --> 00:57.696
Yes. But I should tell you that
I don't really believe in hypnotism.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.203
The act of hypnosis is freewill.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.931
For me to proceed,
your mind must grant the permission.

01:03.096 --> 01:04.973
Will it work on me the first time?

01:05.132 --> 01:07.806
Most of my clients experience results
in three to five sessions.

01:08.468 --> 01:11.449
So we'll work on your anxiety
and paranoia gradually.

01:11.605 --> 01:15.417
See, Mr. Wren, hypnosis is merely
relaxation combined with imagery.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.085
You experience it every night
as you drift asleep,

01:18.478 --> 01:21.618
focus on a book,
or miss your exit on the FDR.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.158
Ready?
- I think so, yes.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.320
Then let's begin.

01:26.486 --> 01:29.160
Please pick up the tablet
beside you,

01:29.323 --> 01:31.929
and choose an image
that speaks to your emotion.

01:35.128 --> 01:36.664
Oh, this one.

01:38.231 --> 01:39.574
I want you to close your eyes

01:39.733 --> 01:41.974
and form a mental picture
of that image.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.947
Picture the birds, the field.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.251
Then one by one,
picture them as they fly away.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.356
Focus on your breathing.

01:52.512 --> 01:53.684
One bird departs.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.953
And as each one goes,
your relaxation increases

01:57.117 --> 02:00.121
and you continue to feel calmer
and more at rest.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.130
<i>For 200 bucks an hour, Finch,</i>

02:02.289 --> 02:05.998
I hope you get more
than an expensive nap.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.133
<i>I want to take you back
to a place in your life</i>

02:08.157 --> 02:10.467
<i>where you were safe
and comfortable.</i>

02:10.597 --> 02:12.634
Can you think of that place,
Mr. Wren?

02:13.166 --> 02:15.043
My childhood bedroom.

02:15.202 --> 02:19.378
Now, I want you to think of
all the ways it made you feel safe.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.176
Picture it clear as day.

02:21.341 --> 02:23.685
What color were the walls?

02:27.714 --> 02:30.524
Hayden Price,
certified hypnotherapist

02:30.684 --> 02:32.061
to the Upper East Side.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.823
Does he do birthday parties'?

02:33.954 --> 02:36.457
It's not that kind
of hypnotism, Mr. Reese.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.797
He caters to wealthy businessmen
and Socialites.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.907
Anger management, smoking cessation,
that sort of thing.

02:43.296 --> 02:44.896
Or so you might think,
if you didn't know

02:44.898 --> 02:46.900
that the office was rented
on a short-term lease,

02:47.067 --> 02:50.742
and that his certification doesn't
come from any association I can find.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.248
During the therapy,
I became attuned

02:53.407 --> 02:56.013
to the kind of questions
that Hayden was asking.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.247
A color that's favorable to you?
Blue.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.222
The name of a childhood pet?
Scout.

03:01.381 --> 03:02.689
He was phishing.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.193
Getting answers
to your security questions.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.354
My bank account
was suddenly signed up

03:07.521 --> 03:10.365
for a recurring automatic
donation to the nonprofit

03:10.524 --> 03:12.765
called "The American
Cancer Coalition Fund."

03:12.926 --> 03:16.271
I'd be willing to wager that
Hayden's name is on that nonprofit.

03:16.430 --> 03:19.206
So, unless he's moonlighting
as a samaritan,

03:19.366 --> 03:22.279
I'd say we're dealing with a
con artist and a very clever thief.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.575
So why'd you even
play along, Finch?

03:24.738 --> 03:26.513
I told Hayden
what he wanted to hear.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.584
I didn't even have a pet as a child.

03:28.742 --> 03:31.951
But when I went to bluejack
his phone, it was blocked.

03:32.112 --> 03:35.685
Someone had already jacked it,
perhaps someone who's out to get him.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.125
And his clients would be
the best place to start

03:38.285 --> 03:40.265
I'll contact Shaw for back-up,

03:40.420 --> 03:43.230
but first I need to look
in on our houseguest.

03:51.698 --> 03:53.871
As before, Ms. Groves,
Mr. Reese is upstairs

03:54.234 --> 03:56.043
with an unhealthy
number of firearms.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.739
Please don't try to run.

03:58.939 --> 04:02.978
Honestly, Harold,
locking me up'?

04:03.043 --> 04:06.047
I admit that the accommodations
are not ideal.

04:06.213 --> 04:10.423
But your confinement
is for your own good.

04:10.550 --> 04:14.396
Harold, your machine called me.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.500
An event that I haven't
fully reasoned out.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.466
But your unpredictability,
your willingness to hurl others

04:19.625 --> 04:22.163
make you as dangerous as ever.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.006
You can't fight the future.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.010
I'll bring you some new books.

04:29.302 --> 04:31.248
I get it.

04:31.404 --> 04:36.683
You wonder why it won't talk
to you like it talks to me.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.349
Don't be jealous, Harold.

04:42.682 --> 04:45.026
Morn still loves us both.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:56.696 --> 04:58.376
<i>When bluejacking Hayden
didn't work,</i>

04:58.498 --> 05:00.705
<i>I sent him a basket of pastries
as a thank you.</i>

05:00.867 --> 05:02.210
Bugged, of course.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.883
I'm just so angry with her,
I could kill her.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.380
And those feelings will dissipate

05:09.543 --> 05:11.887
as you feel calmer, Mr. Sykes.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.388
Tell me about your mother.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.618
Speak her name, out loud.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.887
Her full name.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.122
MEW-

05:19.286 --> 05:23.455
<i>- Mary Shackford Sykes.
- Very good.</i>

05:26.726 --> 05:27.796
That's a start.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.733
It seems therapy
has helped, Sven.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.405
I haven't been able
to sleep this well in months.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.218
And do you still believe
you're surrounded by phonies?

05:42.375 --> 05:43.718
Sadly, yes.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.153
But thanks to you,
I'm able to push past,

05:46.313 --> 05:50.659
to rediscover the quality
and craft of my antique business,

05:50.817 --> 05:52.990
search for the meaning in my work.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.861
Sounds like Hayden isn't
a half-bad therapist after all.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.173
A lot of patients today?

06:03.563 --> 06:04.769
Anybody weird?

06:04.931 --> 06:06.274
Wall-to-wall mommy issues.

06:06.433 --> 06:07.434
Mm.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.774
Enough to make a man want to smoke.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.045
Or under-sleep

06:12.205 --> 06:15.618
or over-eat or...

06:16.776 --> 06:18.255
or?

06:19.679 --> 06:20.851
Who's the girl, Finch?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.294
<i>Her name is Natalie Boal.</i>

06:22.449 --> 06:24.554
She works at an
art gallery downtown.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.720
She started coming
to Hayden for therapy

06:26.887 --> 06:28.389
a little over a year ago.

06:28.555 --> 06:30.296
It's more than therapy now.

06:30.457 --> 06:31.629
Ugh, look at that.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.236
He isn't working her,
he's in love.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.430
And if she's making
those eyes at him,

06:35.595 --> 06:37.541
I bet she doesn't know
about his criminal side.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.106
Someday, no more patients.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.806
No more psychoses.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.315
No more snooty art buyers.

06:47.474 --> 06:49.454
Just you and me.

06:49.609 --> 06:52.488
We just go to the airport...

06:52.646 --> 06:55.092
Jet off to some corner of the world.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.122
Right.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.319
With what money, again?

06:58.485 --> 07:00.761
Let me worry about that.

07:00.921 --> 07:06.667
And when I get enough,
it's just you and me and paradise.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.832
Hayden's on the move, Finch.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.287
<i>According to his schedule,</i>

07:15.311 --> 07:17.179
<i>he doesn't have any more
appointments today.</i>

07:17.337 --> 07:19.647
So where is he going so fast'?

07:24.411 --> 07:26.413
- There you go.
- Thank you.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.354
So, is everything in order?

07:28.515 --> 07:29.926
Relax.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.858
There's nothing to worry over.

07:32.018 --> 07:34.658
The exchange rates
are in your favor.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.368
I started as a teller
at that S&L, you know?

07:38.525 --> 07:41.938
Fifteen years I put in, and then they
tell me I need to take a pay cut.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.439
So I decided
they owed me a pay raise.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.514
Here's my 50,000 dollars, Mr. Russell.

07:52.372 --> 07:53.510
Where's yours?

08:05.151 --> 08:07.392
Outstanding.
Let's proceed.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.063
<i>I'm so gonna shoot this punk.</i>

08:24.204 --> 08:26.150
<i>Something's not right.</i>

08:30.977 --> 08:33.253
We're meeting your contact here?

08:33.413 --> 08:37.327
It's quiet up here, and far from
nosy thieves looking for cash.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.662
No. The only thief here is you.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.832
Detective Decker, NYPD.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.096
Fraud Investigation.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.262
Hands up, sucker.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.102
Sucker'?

08:51.898 --> 08:53.844
I can only guess
what he got you for, pal.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.942
He feed you that line of crap
about the exchange rates?

08:58.104 --> 09:01.278
And you, pass me
that briefcase very slowly.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.461
Not today.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.794
Oh, God.

09:23.797 --> 09:26.243
Mr. Reese, Ms. Shaw,
why aren't you intervening?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.605
<i>Wait for it.</i>

09:30.036 --> 09:31.310
Is he gone?

09:31.471 --> 09:33.314
With his tail between his legs.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.942
Whoa.

09:37.977 --> 09:40.287
We really hooked that fish
for 20 G's?

09:40.447 --> 09:41.551
Sure did.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.455
<i>20?
I thought it was 50.</i>

09:44.651 --> 09:45.652
Here's your half.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.766
Now let's get the hell out of here
before somebody calls the real cops.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.162
Who isn't Hayden ripping off?

09:50.323 --> 09:52.098
This guy's good.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.282
I can watch you nursing
that coffee for just so long.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.853
You should know I called,
to check in on you, Joss.

10:11.010 --> 10:14.184
Well, parking tickets and purse
snatchers aren't exactly a challenge

10:14.347 --> 10:16.520
after my old job, Mr. Quinn.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.959
Alonzo, please.

10:20.286 --> 10:21.287
The last time we met,

10:21.454 --> 10:25.664
you said you had suspicions
about my godson's murder.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.930
I tried working a few leads,

10:28.094 --> 10:32.600
but Cal's department
file was sealed.

10:34.801 --> 10:39.716
There is a chance here that the
organization HR could be involved.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.354
HR'?

10:43.510 --> 10:44.853
I thought HR was disbanded.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.218
The feds just
scattered the roaches.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.486
It's sometimes hard to get 'em all.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.654
Maybe I can
get the Mayor involved,

10:53.820 --> 10:56.494
open doors for you at One PP.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.043
I wouldn't wanna put you
in that kind of position, Mr. Quinn.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.538
I'll take my chances
on this one solo.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.316
All right.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.146
I'm sorry, my shift is starting,

11:15.308 --> 11:17.720
and I have a rookie
partner to pick up.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.486
Saddled you with a rookie, huh?

11:19.646 --> 11:21.751
Goes with the parking tickets
and purse snatchers.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.917
Thanks for the coffee.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.504
Despite Hayden's criminality

11:42.602 --> 11:44.343
and his malfeasant theatrics,

11:44.604 --> 11:45.912
I still think it's more likely

11:46.072 --> 11:48.712
that someone is out to get him
than the other way around.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.946
Someone who bluejacked his phone.

11:51.110 --> 11:54.114
Maybe one of his
clients is on to his scam.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.453
Hayden may have conned
any number of people,

11:56.616 --> 11:58.562
and all it takes is one easy mark

11:58.718 --> 12:01.858
with ties to a gang
or organized crime,

12:02.021 --> 12:03.967
so we don't have a moment to waste.

12:04.123 --> 12:08.071
If you and Ms. Shaw could visit
some of his more irascible clients,

12:08.628 --> 12:12.269
I'll text you their names
and addresses on my way.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.969
- On your way to where?
- Back to therapy.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.635
<i>Mr. Wren,
when I snap my fingers,</i>

12:17.770 --> 12:19.750
you will come totally
out of your resting state

12:19.906 --> 12:23.786
feeling refreshed and relieved
after our conversation.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.121
So how did it go this time'?

12:34.287 --> 12:35.493
Quite well.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.760
You're making
very solid progress, Mr. Wren.

12:37.924 --> 12:41.269
But sadly,
our time is up for the day.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.737
You really are very good
at this, Mr. Price.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.500
I'm so glad that
I was referred to you.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.167
Where did you receive your training'?

12:47.333 --> 12:48.835
The Barringer Hypnosis Institute.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.983
- Oh, here in New York?
- Of Tarzana, California.

12:52.138 --> 12:53.446
I don't believe I know it.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.279
What brought you
all the way out here?

12:57.810 --> 13:00.848
You know, I'm usually the one
asking the questions, Mr. Wren.

13:01.981 --> 13:05.190
Who was it you said
referred you to me again?

13:05.351 --> 13:07.422
Oh, look at that.
You're right.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.667
Our time is up for the day.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.269
<i>Hey, kid, come here.</i>

13:21.701 --> 13:22.873
Yes, sir.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.374
Terney says you've been
keeping an eye on Carter.

13:26.539 --> 13:27.711
Yes, sir.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.480
<i>Willing to step up,
get your hands dirty?</i>

13:31.311 --> 13:32.312
What does that mean'?

13:32.478 --> 13:34.617
Well, we're having trouble
with a money launderer.

13:34.781 --> 13:35.782
Guy messed up big.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.724
But we need him to finish
one more job.

13:38.885 --> 13:42.458
Then you pull his card,
dig a hole.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.659
Rest in peace.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.828
Who's the guy?
The target?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.742
Come on, kid.
We're taking a field trip.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.576
<i>And we're selling the soccer ball.</i>

14:02.742 --> 14:04.722
And I have your bid
at 300,000 dollars.

14:04.877 --> 14:07.585
Now 310,000.
310,000 right here.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.488
Three hundred, twenty-thousand.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.151
Hey, what are we doing here?

14:12.485 --> 14:13.862
That's your guy.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.028
His name is Sven.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.261
He's an antique dealer
down in The Village.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.427
<i>We call him “The Swede."</i>

14:37.710 --> 14:40.281
- So, what's your story?
- You first.

14:40.446 --> 14:42.619
I'm following an HR lead.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.523
They wanna whack a Swedish
antique dealer

14:44.684 --> 14:46.630
for screwing up
their money laundering.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.390
That's funny.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.556
I'm on a con man therapist
who happens to have

14:50.723 --> 14:53.363
a Swedish antique dealer
as a patient.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.403
I'll pretend that makes sense.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.063
I think my con man
might be after

14:57.230 --> 14:58.800
your Swede
and his laundered money.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.137
Well, if that's HR's money,

15:00.299 --> 15:02.279
your con man is in
for a world of hurt.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.211
I'll stick with the con man,
keep him out of trouble.

15:05.371 --> 15:07.908
I'll stick with the antique dealer,
see where he leads.

15:10.309 --> 15:12.550
We are going once.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.883
We are going twice.

15:14.046 --> 15:17.892
Fair warning on this 1911
Honus Wagner baseball card.

15:18.050 --> 15:21.623
Is sold, right here.

15:21.788 --> 15:25.668
Number 103 for 900,000 dollars.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.670
Tomorrow, you're gonna
punch that guy's ticket.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.413
Well, what do you know?

15:42.575 --> 15:45.146
What's the Swede's
therapist doing here?

15:51.350 --> 15:52.790
<i>Hey, Finch,
we need to find out</i>

15:52.852 --> 15:55.196
<i>why everyone's so interested
in The Swede.</i>

15:58.357 --> 16:00.277
<i>So Hayden's patient
is an antiques dealer,</i>

16:00.301 --> 16:02.503
<i>and he spent a million dollars
on a baseball card?</i>

16:02.662 --> 16:05.165
<i>And then tossed it into
some cabinet like it was junk.</i>

16:05.698 --> 16:06.938
I watched him do it.

16:07.099 --> 16:08.442
<i>It's all very strange.</i>

16:08.701 --> 16:10.647
And what business does
an antique dealer have

16:10.803 --> 16:12.544
laundering HR's money
in the first place?

16:12.705 --> 16:14.343
And why do they
want him dead now?

16:22.715 --> 16:25.821
<i>Turns out The Swede
wasn't going to a real therapist.</i>

16:25.985 --> 16:27.828
<i>He was spilling
his guts to a con man.</i>

16:27.987 --> 16:31.560
<i>We'll do a two for one special
and take out the therapist also.</i>

16:35.394 --> 16:36.634
I love that.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.538
You know, that dinner
was such a surprise.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.009
I had a lovely time.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.011
That's not the only surprise.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.218
Let's do it, Nat.

16:50.376 --> 16:51.582
Let's take our trip.

16:51.744 --> 16:54.691
Just go to the airport
and pick our destination.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.191
- Come with me?
- Hayde, are you serious?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.694
What about our jobs, our lives?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.422
They'll be here for us
when we get back.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.089
I wanna be impulsive.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.169
I wanna whisk away
the girl I love.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.672
Yes. of course.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.101
When do we leave?

17:15.268 --> 17:16.440
That's the other surprise.

17:16.702 --> 17:17.703
Now.
Well, tomorrow.

17:19.171 --> 17:20.707
I need to do a few things.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.285
Pick you up in the AM'?

17:23.442 --> 17:25.353
I'll pack fast.

17:27.946 --> 17:31.952
Finch, our con man's
blowing the country fast.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.218
Somethings up.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.090
Oh, my God.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.300
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.841
Who the hell are you?

18:28.007 --> 18:29.645
The night watch.

18:31.077 --> 18:32.454
Who are these guys?

18:34.847 --> 18:37.657
The cops.
The real cops.

18:46.325 --> 18:47.685
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

18:48.194 --> 18:50.538
We were gonna ask you
the same thing, Hayden.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.607
I just spoke with Detective Carter.

18:52.765 --> 18:55.371
She identified the badge numbers
you gave me as HR.

18:55.534 --> 18:56.842
She's positive.

18:59.538 --> 19:00.881
What's the deal, con man?

19:01.040 --> 19:03.384
Look. Someone just turned
my office into Swiss cheese,

19:03.542 --> 19:05.044
and my girlfriend
is waiting for me.

19:05.211 --> 19:07.020
If she goes back to my place
or to my office"

19:07.179 --> 19:08.817
I spoke to Natalie
a half an hour ago.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.983
I explained to her
how I was your new assistant

19:11.150 --> 19:14.222
and I needed to stash her
in a motel until you'd visit her.

19:14.387 --> 19:15.866
Slight lie.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.729
But nothing on a par
with you, Hayden.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.801
That's funny
coming from you, Mr. Wren.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.802
We know you've been
scamming your patients,

19:21.961 --> 19:25.238
and we know you've had your eye
on a Mr. Vanger, the antique dealer.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.742
Did you know he was
a money launderer for HR?

19:27.900 --> 19:29.573
I've heard of HR, but I swear,

19:29.735 --> 19:31.237
I didn't know the money was theirs.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.883
Who'd you think you were grifting'?

19:33.039 --> 19:35.485
Sven came into my office
a couple of months ago.

19:35.641 --> 19:38.178
He was a chain smoker
who had millions

19:38.344 --> 19:40.346
bouncing around in his accounts.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.823
It would have been an easy score.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.222
Look what happened.

19:44.383 --> 19:45.862
I didn't sign up for real bullets.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.725
I'm done with this con
and I'm out of here.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.264
- Where's Natalie?
- Nice try.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.423
You're staying put.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.262
What don't you get about "Done"?

19:52.425 --> 19:54.530
Look.
You want me out of town?

19:54.694 --> 19:56.435
I'm out of town.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.268
But I can't go without her.

19:59.098 --> 20:05.674
See, she's the only
honest thing left about me.

20:08.574 --> 20:10.247
I have to try
and hold on to that.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.534
<i>Detective, have you found out
how the antique dealer</i>

20:17.550 --> 20:19.689
<i>is connected
to HR's money laundering?</i>

20:19.852 --> 20:21.456
<i>GARTER". Fm meeting my source now.</i>

20:22.288 --> 20:24.461
You haven't
touched your wine, Joss.

20:24.623 --> 20:27.695
- You're off duty.
- I'm always on duty.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.703
Have you heard a word I said?

20:29.862 --> 20:32.206
What do you think about
the money being laundered?

20:32.364 --> 20:34.241
I heard every word.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.142
And the money's just HR's
skim off the Russians.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.305
A percentage kicked back
to your friends in blue

20:39.472 --> 20:42.248
for turning a blind eye
to the Yogorov business.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.115
Please, try the
Brunello di Montalcino.

20:44.276 --> 20:46.950
The finish is quite exquisite.

20:54.587 --> 20:55.998
What I don't understand

20:56.155 --> 20:59.500
is what HR wants
with an antique business.

20:59.658 --> 21:00.728
Clean money.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.567
<i>See, HR doesn't want blood-soaked
bills from the Russians.</i>

21:03.729 --> 21:05.606
<i>They want their cut
in ones and zeroes,</i>

21:05.765 --> 21:09.178
<i>to transfer into their 401 Ks,
offshore accounts.</i>

21:09.335 --> 21:11.178
<i>So, the antique dealer cycles</i>

21:11.337 --> 21:13.283
<i>the dirty Russian money
into his own accounts</i>

21:13.439 --> 21:15.077
<i>and waits for instructions.</i>

21:15.241 --> 21:16.686
<i>Then he heads
to the auction house,</i>

21:16.842 --> 21:18.344
<i>where he's told to bid
on a certain</i>

21:18.511 --> 21:21.492
high-priced item,
an item auctioned off

21:21.647 --> 21:24.127
by a seller representing HR.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.459
Our next item up for bid
is lot number 426.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.032
An extremely rare baseball

21:30.189 --> 21:32.931
signed by all
of the 1927 New York Yankees,

21:33.092 --> 21:35.538
including Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth.

21:35.694 --> 21:38.436
Informally named,
"Murderer's Row Ball."

21:38.597 --> 21:41.203
I'd like to start the bidding
at two million dollars.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.040
I got a bid for two million dollars.

21:43.202 --> 21:44.722
Four-point-four million dollars.
Where?

21:44.746 --> 21:47.549
Four-point-four in the front
going once, twice.

21:47.706 --> 21:50.880
Sold right here,
four-point-four million dollars. Thank you.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.546
<i>The Swede bids the highest,
and all of that dirty money</i>

21:53.712 --> 21:57.387
<i>is deposited into HR's coffers,
squeaky clean and laundered,</i>

21:57.550 --> 21:59.325
<i>and ready for
digital distribution.</i>

21:59.485 --> 22:00.565
<i>But I don't get it.</i>

22:00.686 --> 22:02.131
<i>They haven't laundered the money.</i>

22:02.288 --> 22:04.199
<i>They've just bought
an overpriced baseball.</i>

22:04.356 --> 22:06.716
<i>All the items HR auctions off
may have been appraised</i>

22:06.826 --> 22:08.669
<i>for millions of dollars,
but they're really</i>

22:08.828 --> 22:11.570
<i>just fugazis, fakes,
worthless junk.</i>

22:13.799 --> 22:16.473
<i>So HR gets Russian
money for nothing?</i>

22:16.502 --> 22:18.573
<i>It's a perfect system,</i>

22:18.737 --> 22:20.808
<i>till someone on the outside
knows about it.</i>

22:38.023 --> 22:39.623
So if your con man
thinks he can swoop in

22:39.758 --> 22:43.331
and take a piece of HR's business,
he better watch his back.

22:48.267 --> 22:49.610
Who do you always meet in there?

22:49.768 --> 22:51.577
None of your business.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.676
Carter, I've been thinking.

22:54.840 --> 22:59.789
That antique dealer,
I can't just kill someone.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.923
When I got involved with HR,
I didn't think...

23:03.082 --> 23:05.426
No, you didn't think.

23:05.584 --> 23:07.894
You just looked the other way.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.260
I can't do that anymore.

23:10.422 --> 23:12.732
And you're the only person
I've got on my side right now.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.872
I'm not on your side.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.473
But I'm also not letting a
homicide happen under my watch.

23:19.765 --> 23:23.474
So, tomorrow,
you're calling in sick.

23:23.636 --> 23:24.637
I am?

23:24.803 --> 23:26.874
Yeah, see you
just got a new job.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.712
Tomorrow,
you're Simmons's shadow.

23:29.141 --> 23:30.882
Wherever he goes, you go.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.649
Whoever he meets with,
you get pictures of.

23:34.980 --> 23:36.982
See, we just tapped
into their piggy bank.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.322
Now I wanna know
who's running the bank.

23:47.660 --> 23:48.832
What is going on'?

23:48.994 --> 23:50.132
Where have you been'?

23:50.296 --> 23:52.139
Who is that creepy guy?

23:52.298 --> 23:53.675
Natalie, I'm so sorry.

23:53.832 --> 23:56.335
I get a call from your office
telling me to come to some hotel,

23:56.502 --> 23:57.503
and you don't show up.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.172
It's okay.
You need to take a breath.

23:59.338 --> 24:01.147
The more you breathe,
the calmer you'll be.

24:01.307 --> 24:02.308
Do not hypno-talk me.

24:02.474 --> 24:04.681
I'm not hypno-talking you.
I'm saying, be calm...

24:04.843 --> 24:06.363
I'm not one of your patients.

24:06.512 --> 24:07.792
I know that.
I know that.

24:07.816 --> 24:09.056
You have to tell me...

24:11.850 --> 24:15.627
<i>Finch, you ever notice how much
of our job is like babysitting?</i>

24:15.788 --> 24:17.825
Well, it's more than that today.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.596
<i>I don't think Hayden's told us
the whole story of his con.</i>

24:20.759 --> 24:22.705
I'm going over Hayden's hard drive,

24:22.861 --> 24:25.307
what I downloaded of it
before he zapped it,

24:25.464 --> 24:27.705
<i>and I'm finding emails addressed
to Sven Vanger,</i>

24:27.866 --> 24:29.038
the antique dealer.

24:29.201 --> 24:33.445
Hayden may have elicited his email
password while he was under hypnosis.

24:33.605 --> 24:36.381
It appears that Hayden
duplicated an email

24:36.542 --> 24:39.182
that Sven had received
but not yet read.

24:39.345 --> 24:40.722
And he altered it in the process.

24:40.879 --> 24:42.881
<i>And what did the email say?</i>

24:43.048 --> 24:44.857
<i>The email is from
an anonymous address,</i>

24:45.017 --> 24:47.122
regarding an auction
that took place today.

24:47.286 --> 24:50.859
In it, Vanger was instructed
to bid on lot 424,

24:51.023 --> 24:56.166
but Hayden redrafted it,
instructing him to bid on lot 426.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.672
<i>Perhaps you should ask Hayden why.</i>

25:04.636 --> 25:06.013
He went out the window.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.853
<i>Finch, Hayden used his girlfriend
and gave us all the slip.</i>

25:21.086 --> 25:22.690
I'm sorry.
I'm about to close.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.994
No, Sven, you're already closed.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.765
Who are you with,
the Russians or the police?

25:30.929 --> 25:32.067
I have nothing left for you.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.437
I'm not with either.

25:33.599 --> 25:37.046
But I do need something, answers.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.575
I'm not your doormat.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.384
Why don't you drop that
before you hurt yourself, Sven?

25:47.913 --> 25:49.392
Give it to me.

25:52.251 --> 25:55.130
Why is it every time you call me,
I know to bring a firearm?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.635
But he was such a good therapist.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.205
Hey, Dragon Tattoo,

26:03.362 --> 26:04.966
he's also a con man
who stole from you.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.701
Not stealing from me,
stealing from them.

26:07.866 --> 26:08.986
He should not be doing that.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.045
How'd you even get into this mess?

26:12.471 --> 26:14.473
Seven months ago,
I got in trouble

26:14.640 --> 26:16.313
with the customs
here in New York.

26:16.475 --> 26:18.216
A cop named Simmons
came and said he could

26:18.377 --> 26:20.983
make the charges go away
if I helped them launder cash

26:21.146 --> 26:23.990
for a few Russian associates
of theirs.

26:24.149 --> 26:27.323
At first, it was just
a few hundred thousand each month.

26:27.486 --> 26:30.592
Then it became
more and more, millions.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.167
I got rid of
the last cash today.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.304
On lot 426'?

26:34.460 --> 26:36.770
- How did you know about that?
- Hayden played you.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.910
He switched out your emails, and
made you bid on the wrong item today.

26:40.065 --> 26:41.908
Then what did I purchase?

26:45.170 --> 26:49.277
A real ball,
signed by the real 1927 Yankees,

26:49.441 --> 26:51.512
really worth four-point-four million.

26:51.677 --> 26:53.281
That was a hell of a season.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.924
Where's the ball, Sven?

26:55.080 --> 26:56.457
It's gone.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.289
I sold it for five dollars.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.623
They're going to kill me.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.629
I gotta get out
of this city immediately!

27:02.788 --> 27:04.665
Too late.
You're a marked man.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.264
Close your eyes.
This stuff burns.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.940
So we're faking crime scenes now'?

27:15.968 --> 27:18.005
A long way from your days
back at the Eighth.

27:18.170 --> 27:19.706
Might wanna spread it out.

27:19.872 --> 27:22.648
- Arterial spray is more erratic.
- Will you let me work?

27:24.543 --> 27:28.013
Going for a kind of a
hollow-point special kind of motif.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.387
- There.
- Congratulations.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.655
You've just died and been reborn.

27:36.822 --> 27:40.395
Now, take your new life,
and get the hell out of New York.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.184
- Yeah'?
<i>- Hey, rookie,</i>

27:59.344 --> 28:01.415
<i>I need you to hold off
on the antique dealer.</i>

28:01.580 --> 28:04.993
<i>Something went wrong at the auction
house. We didn't get our money.</i>

28:05.150 --> 28:07.391
Sir, there's a small problem.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.061
<i>Just heard from my source in HR,</i>

28:11.156 --> 28:12.760
<i>Simmons knows
they get ripped off.</i>

28:13.025 --> 28:15.562
All this baseball stuff,
you should've called me in sooner.

28:15.727 --> 28:17.206
I'm kind of a Mets fan, though.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.774
Somewhere in the city,
your soda kid's walking around

28:19.932 --> 28:22.037
<i>with a zillion-dollar
baseball in his pocket.</i>

28:22.201 --> 28:24.044
With HR looking for the ball.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.114
And the young man has no idea.

28:26.271 --> 28:28.114
Let's hope he don't play catch.

28:36.915 --> 28:39.759
Hey, kiddo,
you got something for me?

29:03.609 --> 29:07.056
I can't believe Hayden would use his
girlfriend as an excuse to escape.

29:07.212 --> 29:10.318
I can. A baseball worth four million
would be a motivational force.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.985
He doesn't care who he steps
on to get away with it either.

29:13.151 --> 29:16.223
Exactly. He still has to get away,
but he won't go without Natalie.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.765
As you and I well know,

29:17.923 --> 29:21.063
sometimes necessity
and desire can conflict.

29:21.226 --> 29:22.330
Hayden's still in the city.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.974
He's too smart
to use his own phone.

29:25.130 --> 29:26.837
So how do we track him?

29:26.999 --> 29:29.570
We don't.
We track Natalie.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.510
Hayden's calling her right now.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.117
Nat, please, I'm sorry.

29:35.173 --> 29:38.643
I've done things that I'm
not proud of, but I love you.

29:40.178 --> 29:41.179
<i>Can you trust me on that?</i>

29:41.346 --> 29:43.292
I wanna know what's
going on right now.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.019
That's a little complicated, Nat.

29:46.184 --> 29:48.323
- Wait. Where are you?
- I'm going home.

29:48.487 --> 29:50.367
Did you think I was
gonna sit in that hotel room

29:50.522 --> 29:51.796
after you went out the window?

29:51.957 --> 29:53.265
No, honey, you can't go there.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.961
<i>- It's not safe for you.</i>
Really?

29:55.127 --> 29:56.765
How would I even know'?

29:56.928 --> 29:59.602
Look, Hayden, I love you.

29:59.765 --> 30:02.871
But I deserve the truth,
or else I'm done.

30:08.173 --> 30:10.881
I'm a criminal and a thief.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.951
But I'm done with that life.

30:14.112 --> 30:16.718
I secured a score
that will ensure our future.

30:17.516 --> 30:20.622
<i>The kind of score that
would let us pick our destination.</i>

30:21.286 --> 30:24.631
If you meet me outside
my old office in one hour,

30:24.790 --> 30:28.067
<i>then we can fly to any corner
of the world like we planned.</i>

30:28.226 --> 30:29.899
<i>And I'll tell you everything.</i>

30:30.896 --> 30:34.810
Stop loving me or even hate me,
but please hear me out.

30:42.874 --> 30:44.410
I'll be there.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.430
I didn't wanna worry you.

31:03.595 --> 31:04.869
I'm cleanin' up this mess.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.067
You say The Swede
bought the baseball?

31:07.666 --> 31:10.044
That's what the logs
at the auction house said.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.614
But without him, it's gonna be
a little tough to track him.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.580
That idiot bought
a real autographed ball

31:14.740 --> 31:18.711
worth four-point-four million dollars,
and we had a rookie kill him

31:18.877 --> 31:21.448
before we found out
what he did with it?

31:21.613 --> 31:24.389
Maybe the rookie should be
handling your end of things.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.722
At least he follows through.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.058
But you said there
was a con man involved.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.098
- Yeah.
- Find him.

31:31.256 --> 31:32.894
Shake him till
the damn ball falls out.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.629
And tell me you have
at least one lead.

31:35.794 --> 31:36.864
When we tapped his phone,

31:37.028 --> 31:39.269
we found out about the
con man's little girlfriend.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.035
It seems the guy's in love.

31:41.199 --> 31:43.475
He ain't going anywhere without her.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.581
Make it right, Simmons.

31:46.705 --> 31:49.311
I got two loves,
my money and this city.

31:49.474 --> 31:52.148
Mess with either,
I mess right back.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.828
Hey, lover boy.

32:12.330 --> 32:14.173
What'd you expect?
I'm a crook.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.814
He's my expert.

32:22.674 --> 32:23.744
What, you don't trust me'?

32:23.909 --> 32:26.116
Like you said, you're a crook.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.622
I don't know about expert,
but it looks pretty damn real.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.020
I have a buyer lined up.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.753
I'll split it with you, 50/50.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.829
450/40?
- Not a half bad deal, huh?

32:36.655 --> 32:38.157
Will you at least
let me call Natalie

32:38.323 --> 32:40.929
before you kill me or arrest me

32:41.092 --> 32:43.094
or put me in a well
in your basement?

32:44.429 --> 32:45.931
You have 30 seconds.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.647
<i>Sorry to disappoint,
con man.</i>

32:53.772 --> 32:56.446
Seems the NYPD isn't bad
at phone traces.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.281
I found your girl in 20 minutes.

32:58.443 --> 33:00.684
- I'll give you the ball. It's yours.
- Don't be noble.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.621
There's only criminals on this line.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.556
<i>But I'll take the ball,
just the same.</i>

33:04.716 --> 33:08.061
You meet me in front of
the auction house in 20 minutes.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.067
- How bad is it?
- They'll kill her.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.570
These people,
for this much money?

33:16.728 --> 33:18.537
So what are you gonna do
to stop them?

33:19.898 --> 33:22.071
I'm scum. I get it.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.475
But Natalia...

33:24.636 --> 33:28.413
My ultimate con, my final trick
was gonna be actually

33:28.573 --> 33:30.746
turning into the guy
that she fell in love with.

33:32.143 --> 33:35.647
I'll give it all away
to save her life.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.555
Will you help me?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.088
<i>This is how it goes.</i>

33:41.253 --> 33:43.426
Rookie stays outside with the girl.

33:43.588 --> 33:47.434
Terney, take the con man inside,
verify the ball is real.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.697
I'm not taking any more chances
with this clown.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.033
Why do I have to go inside?

33:51.196 --> 33:53.073
Because that's what
you were just told.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.710
Once we confirm
the ball is the real deal,

33:56.868 --> 33:59.109
Laskey takes the girl,
puts a double tap in her head.

34:00.672 --> 34:01.844
Questions?

34:02.007 --> 34:05.420
Boss, she doesn't know anything.

34:05.577 --> 34:06.777
Why don't we just let her go'?

34:06.878 --> 34:09.688
Do I look like I'm taking
suggestions from rookies today?

34:09.848 --> 34:10.849
No, sir.

34:15.453 --> 34:16.454
The ball?

34:16.621 --> 34:18.065
The girl.

34:20.958 --> 34:22.370
I wanna talk to Natalie.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.202
You're going inside first.

34:25.362 --> 34:27.969
One thing you can trust about a thief
is he'll always be a thief.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.272
I'm so sorry.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.315
Call me when there's
money and bodies.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.166
Laskey.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.239
You were right, Carter.

34:58.396 --> 34:59.966
They would never let her go.

35:01.132 --> 35:02.236
Make it look good.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.939
Remember, the aim
shouldn't be to hurt him,

35:06.104 --> 35:07.481
just incapacitate him a little.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.448
Also, watch your knuckles.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.778
I've punched a lot of guys.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.792
So have I.

35:19.818 --> 35:21.354
Let's get you to safety.

35:22.187 --> 35:24.187
We've been through
this already, it's real.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.998
You think I'd be standing
here if it wasn't?

35:26.157 --> 35:28.330
- We'll see.
- I'll know in a minute.

35:29.461 --> 35:30.963
I need a microscope
to know for sure,

35:31.129 --> 35:33.837
but the texture appears accurate.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.607
There is, however, a problem.

35:40.005 --> 35:41.814
What?

35:41.973 --> 35:44.010
See this?
Babe Ruth's signature?

35:44.175 --> 35:45.210
Yeah. What about it?

35:45.377 --> 35:46.856
It's in felt-tip pen.

35:47.012 --> 35:49.219
Those didn't exist
when Babe Ruth was alive.

35:51.049 --> 35:53.620
This ball is a fake.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.379
You give us a fake?
You give us a fake?

36:09.534 --> 36:10.569
You wanna die'?

36:10.735 --> 36:12.715
I swear, that is the real ball.

36:12.871 --> 36:14.578
The real ball costs four million dollars.

36:14.739 --> 36:18.312
The fake is just gonna
cost you a bullet, con man.

36:18.476 --> 36:20.547
Why would I lie'?

36:20.712 --> 36:21.747
You have to believe me.

36:21.913 --> 36:22.914
We can figure this out.

36:23.081 --> 36:25.027
Where is the real ball?

36:28.420 --> 36:29.922
Terney.

36:30.422 --> 36:31.492
Ow!

36:37.228 --> 36:39.174
So where's the real ball'?

36:40.165 --> 36:42.611
I have no idea.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.610
I thought this was the real ball.

36:44.769 --> 36:46.908
Forget that.
Where's Natalie?

36:47.072 --> 36:49.109
I put her in a cab,
told her to go somewhere safe.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.618
This is Natalie.

36:57.782 --> 36:59.887
Nat, where are you?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.052
<i>Are you okay?</i>

37:01.219 --> 37:03.290
Oh, I'm better than okay.

37:03.455 --> 37:05.799
<i>You see, that antique dealer,</i>

37:05.957 --> 37:08.028
Sven was his name,
well, he may have been

37:08.193 --> 37:11.640
your big score,
but you were my big whale,

37:11.796 --> 37:13.798
<i>from the moment I met you.</i>

37:14.733 --> 37:17.543
You played me?

37:17.702 --> 37:19.204
Why steal millions from criminals

37:19.370 --> 37:23.045
when you can date the thief
and take it off him?

37:24.409 --> 37:25.786
Keep the change.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.081
<i>Of course,
things did get a bit hairy</i>

37:29.247 --> 37:31.318
with those corrupt cops,
but you always did know

37:31.483 --> 37:33.292
how to show a girl
a good time, Hayden.

37:34.419 --> 37:36.057
Where will you go'?

37:36.221 --> 37:39.293
Oh, go find an airport,
maybe just pick a destination.

37:39.457 --> 37:41.459
<i>Isn't that the dream come true?</i>

37:42.961 --> 37:44.998
You know, I really did love you.

37:46.631 --> 37:49.510
Well, if you love something,
set it free.

38:02.514 --> 38:03.686
I'm ruined.

38:03.848 --> 38:06.294
Maybe it's time you went
on the straight and narrow.

38:07.986 --> 38:09.488
You'll live longer.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.127
I hear hypnotherapists are in
pretty high demand these days.

38:18.096 --> 38:20.940
You know, I do have
a thriving practice to rebuild.

38:21.099 --> 38:23.705
I'm gonna need a new office
with a few less bullet holes.

38:23.868 --> 38:25.506
My advice?

38:25.670 --> 38:27.672
Rebuild in another city.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.070
Detective Terney,
I can't help but notice

38:54.232 --> 38:56.041
you're not carrying a ball.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.738
The ball the con man
brought was a fake.

38:58.903 --> 39:02.077
The guy with the suit showed up,
rolled Laskey and our guys,

39:02.240 --> 39:04.743
and then got away
with the con man and his girl.

39:04.909 --> 39:06.889
Do you have any idea
what's at stake here?

39:08.213 --> 39:09.920
You go find that screw-up Laskey

39:10.081 --> 39:12.561
and you scour this city
until you find that bail.

39:12.717 --> 39:14.663
Simmons, I'm not the rookie.

39:14.819 --> 39:16.594
Don't talk to me like one.

39:17.422 --> 39:19.925
If you don't find that ball,

39:20.091 --> 39:23.698
then it's gonna be a four million dollar
funeral for the both of you.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.500
Now go.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.289
I was just turning out
the lights for the evening,

39:41.446 --> 39:42.925
Ms. Groves,
and I remembered that

39:43.081 --> 39:45.584
I had promised to bring you
some new reading material.

39:46.851 --> 39:49.195
A peace offering, Harold?

39:49.354 --> 39:50.731
Is that what you've brought'?

39:51.256 --> 39:53.293
I really think if you
could just see things my way,

39:53.458 --> 39:54.459
and not consider this...

39:54.626 --> 39:56.128
Imprisonment?

39:57.395 --> 40:00.399
Is there any other way
to consider it?

40:00.632 --> 40:03.442
This truly is
for your own good, Ms. Groves.

40:04.602 --> 40:06.275
I mean that when I say it.

40:08.439 --> 40:12.444
This synchronistic relationship

40:12.610 --> 40:15.284
that you've developed
with the machine, it can't be...

40:20.952 --> 40:22.590
I worry about you.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.495
You've misunderstood the situation.

40:34.165 --> 40:35.906
You shouldn't worry about me.

40:39.103 --> 40:41.515
I'm worried about you, Harold.

40:42.674 --> 40:45.746
You can't stop what's coming,
and neither can I.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.585
But we have the opportunity

40:47.745 --> 40:50.817
to understand things
when they finally change.

40:51.916 --> 40:53.657
The future is coming.

40:55.853 --> 40:57.355
You started it...

41:00.358 --> 41:01.928
and I'll finish it.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.964
<i>You missed me. Leave a message.</i>

41:07.988 --> 41:09.673
<i>Laskey, I'm outside your place.</i>

41:10.001 --> 41:11.810
We have a lot of work to do.
Come on.

41:14.272 --> 41:16.115
I stuck to the guy like glue.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.779
This is everyone Simmons met with.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.683
Thanks, kid.
You did all right.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.950
But you should know,
it'll get harder out there.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.892
After these last few days,
things are gonna heat up.

41:28.052 --> 41:29.963
So you need to be prepared.

41:30.121 --> 41:33.125
Oh. When I got involved with HR,

41:33.291 --> 41:36.204
I thought it was about loyalty.

41:36.361 --> 41:38.068
I was wrong.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.331
It's about murder and greed.

41:41.366 --> 41:45.007
Well, ain't that cozy.

41:46.404 --> 41:48.577
I should've known
she'd turn you, rookie.

41:48.740 --> 41:51.482
The first time I saw you,
I knew you were weak.

41:51.642 --> 41:54.248
So let me tell you
how the world works now, kid.

41:56.347 --> 41:59.692
We kill her or they kill us.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.824
Thai decision is gonna
be your last, Terney.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.496
No!

42:09.160 --> 42:11.834
Laskey'?

42:19.537 --> 42:24.008
That much blood, and you'll
be dead in a minute, maybe two.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.619
Make 'em count.

42:26.444 --> 42:28.685
Who do you and Simmons report to'?

42:28.846 --> 42:30.416
Who calls the shots?

42:32.283 --> 42:35.127
Is the answer
in these pictures, huh?

42:36.788 --> 42:39.860
Last chance, Terney!
Be a cop!

42:40.024 --> 42:43.028
