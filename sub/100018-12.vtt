If I'm Robin, who are you?

00:23.428 --> 00:26.297
[Dick] <i>That's a good question.</i>

00:26.330 --> 00:27.632
Maybe we should be apart.

00:33.005 --> 00:37.073
So where's a guy got to go
to get some real shit
around these parts?

00:37.075 --> 00:38.741
Every time I try to
get close to you, Rose,

00:38.741 --> 00:39.609
you push me away.

00:39.643 --> 00:41.146
It's me.

00:41.179 --> 00:44.148

this little game you're playing</i>

00:44.182 --> 00:46.183
I quit.

00:46.216 --> 00:47.817
This is...

00:47.851 --> 00:49.753
a family of choice.

00:49.753 --> 00:51.253
If you can unite,

00:51.255 --> 00:53.024
you can face any threat.

00:53.057 --> 00:54.892

How many times
are you gonna do that?

02:27.951 --> 02:31.854
Until I get out of your head.

02:31.889 --> 02:33.390
And then what?

02:33.424 --> 02:35.025
I'll stop you.

02:35.026 --> 02:36.493
One way or another.

02:36.526 --> 02:40.564
[chuckles] Too late.

02:40.598 --> 02:45.068
Your friends just can't seem
to stay apart.

02:45.102 --> 02:47.237
I warned Grayson.

02:47.270 --> 02:48.806
This is on him.

02:48.840 --> 02:51.008
[Jericho] You want
someone to blame?

02:51.040 --> 02:52.175
Blame me.

02:52.209 --> 02:54.512
[Slade] The Titans lied to you.

02:54.544 --> 02:57.381
They took advantage of you.
Of us.

02:57.414 --> 03:02.414
And they admitted it.
We moved on.

03:12.896 --> 03:16.133
The good news is,
they brought us together.

03:16.167 --> 03:19.969
Five years stuck
inside this hell.

03:20.003 --> 03:22.240
[Slade] I'll remind you...

I thought you'd save me.

03:39.490 --> 03:42.593
You want to kill them
because they exposed you.

03:42.627 --> 03:45.395
Showed me who you really are.

03:45.430 --> 03:47.931
Well, I've seen.

03:47.965 --> 03:50.167
You're a monster,

just up a little bit,
because that hurts right there.

13:13.798 --> 13:14.932
Yeah, okay.

13:14.966 --> 13:16.201
-Easy.
-Okay.

13:16.234 --> 13:18.769
[Hank] Easy, yeah, like that.

13:18.802 --> 13:21.605
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, easy, easy.

13:21.639 --> 13:26.043
Yeah, like that. Easy.

13:26.076 --> 13:28.177
[Hank snoring]

13:31.514 --> 13:34.184
Frank?

13:34.219 --> 13:36.653
[sighs in frustration]

13:36.687 --> 13:38.655
Jesus.

13:38.688 --> 13:40.758
I knew you weren't Hawk.

13:40.791 --> 13:44.895
[continues snoring]

13:44.928 --> 13:48.264
[grunts]

13:48.298 --> 13:49.347
[yells]

14:04.581 --> 14:05.631
[yells]

14:10.653 --> 14:13.191
How's the bathroom?

14:13.224 --> 14:16.494
The bathroom is gross.
Don't go in there.

14:16.528 --> 14:18.796
[Rachel]
Whatcha you doing out here?

14:18.828 --> 14:21.397
Enjoying the view. You ready?

14:25.500 --> 14:26.538
Hey, are you mad at something?

14:26.571 --> 14:28.105
No, Rachel,
I'm thrilled to be looking

14:28.139 --> 14:30.107
for a guy that doesn't need
to be rescued.

14:30.140 --> 14:32.176
Dick is in trouble. I saw it.

14:32.210 --> 14:33.445
Okay, then knock yourself out

14:33.477 --> 14:35.846
and dream up
his exact location.

14:35.879 --> 14:38.649
He's around here.

14:38.682 --> 14:39.881
I think.

14:48.091 --> 14:49.892
[Kory sighs]

14:53.397 --> 14:54.731
Fuck.

14:54.764 --> 14:56.234
What is it?

14:56.267 --> 14:57.868
Something's happened
with Gar.

14:57.902 --> 15:00.152
[engine starts]

15:03.807 --> 15:04.808
Hey, where are we going?

15:04.808 --> 15:07.077
Back to San Francisco.

15:07.110 --> 15:08.178
What about Dick?

15:08.179 --> 15:10.114
-We're going back.
-Okay, so that's it?

15:10.114 --> 15:11.200
You know, I don't get a say.

15:11.200 --> 15:12.182
You're just gonna
pull the adult card?

15:12.182 --> 15:13.750
Yeah, well, someone has to make

15:13.751 --> 15:14.951
some adult decisions
around here.

15:14.951 --> 15:16.386
No more running after
Dick Grayson

15:16.386 --> 15:18.489
'cause some
intergalactic space witch

15:18.489 --> 15:19.222
had a bad dream.

15:19.222 --> 15:20.890
Oh, I'm the space witch?

15:20.890 --> 15:22.025
You're the space witch

15:22.025 --> 15:25.496
who has no idea
where she's going or why.

15:25.529 --> 15:27.063
Easy, Truth-Claw,
you didn't even know

15:27.063 --> 15:28.332
your own name
a couple of months ago.

15:28.332 --> 15:29.966
[Kory] Yeah, well,
I know it now.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.668
Kory Anders.

15:31.701 --> 15:32.770
Big whoop.

15:32.803 --> 15:36.841
Princess Alien Pink Hair
from Planet Tam-O-Whatever--

15:36.841 --> 15:37.841
Tamaran!

15:37.841 --> 15:38.808
Whatever!

15:38.808 --> 15:40.378
Get it right.

15:40.410 --> 15:44.760
Do I look like I give a fuck?

15:49.753 --> 15:52.023
-Kory--
-Nope.

15:52.056 --> 15:55.025
Hey, I'm sorry.

15:55.058 --> 15:57.394
I really am.

15:57.427 --> 16:00.630
[voice breaking]
It's not your fault.

16:00.663 --> 16:05.001
It's mine. I just...

16:05.035 --> 16:07.270
I got upset
because I used to be

16:07.304 --> 16:12.304
so in control of everything,
you know?

16:14.110 --> 16:17.615
Like I felt like I could
do anything, and now I...

16:17.649 --> 16:21.385
All my best qualities
are just gone.

16:21.418 --> 16:24.288
Those aren't
your best qualities.

16:24.322 --> 16:29.092
I'm sorry I pulled
the adult card.

16:29.125 --> 16:32.363
I'm sorry I called you
an intergalactic witch.

16:32.397 --> 16:37.168
I do give a fuck about
what your planet's called.

16:37.201 --> 16:40.650
We're partners in this.

16:48.879 --> 16:52.015
We should go back
to San Francisco.

16:52.048 --> 16:56.953
Looks like Gar
really needs our help.

16:56.988 --> 16:59.722
I'm sorry we didn't find Dick.

16:59.756 --> 17:01.625
It's okay.

17:01.658 --> 17:03.126
He'll find his way back.

17:03.126 --> 17:04.126
Yeah.

17:10.634 --> 17:11.634
What are you making?

17:11.634 --> 17:13.270
Your future.

17:13.304 --> 17:16.240
Cheese dogs,
onion dogs, kraut dogs.

17:16.273 --> 17:18.741
These people have tons of them
in the fridge.

17:18.776 --> 17:19.977
Hot dogs are my future?

17:20.010 --> 17:22.746
No, no, no, no.
Me making you lunch

17:22.779 --> 17:26.529
and breakfast and dinner.

17:29.653 --> 17:31.355
Well, uh, cheers.

17:31.388 --> 17:34.838
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

17:39.631 --> 17:43.567
I, uh, have
to ask you something.

17:43.599 --> 17:46.037
[Jason exhales]

17:46.069 --> 17:48.138
Rose...

17:48.172 --> 17:50.709
will you...

17:50.741 --> 17:54.644
try my all-natural, grass-fed,
hormone-free onion dog?

17:54.644 --> 17:55.646
[chuckles] I will.

17:55.680 --> 18:00.630
-[sighs in relief]
-[Rose laughs]

18:01.419 --> 18:02.586
-Damn!
-Right?

18:02.619 --> 18:07.619
-It's fucking good.
-[cell phone vibrating]

18:11.428 --> 18:12.529
Oh.

18:12.564 --> 18:15.132
-What?
-[Jason] It's Rachel.

18:15.132 --> 18:16.200
Gar's in trouble.

18:16.233 --> 18:20.003
She said they need
all hands on deck.

18:20.037 --> 18:22.007
Yeah? Yeah, well, fuck that.

18:22.039 --> 18:24.541
The Titans can deal
with their problems without us.

18:24.576 --> 18:27.077
It's not like they wanted us
to help before.

18:27.111 --> 18:30.347
Sounds like they need us now.

18:30.381 --> 18:32.517
It's probably Dick
playing some games.

18:32.549 --> 18:34.884
Some kind of fucking test.

18:34.884 --> 18:35.720
I'm done with that shit.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.020
If they're getting
back together,

18:37.020 --> 18:38.088
my dad will come for them.

18:38.122 --> 18:39.356
He'll kill them all.

18:39.390 --> 18:41.657
Your dad is probably killing
bankers in Geneva.

18:41.692 --> 18:43.094
No, he's not.

18:43.126 --> 18:46.196
What?
You guys Facebook friends now?

18:46.230 --> 18:50.666
[sighs] Look, we need to talk.

18:50.666 --> 18:51.536
Later.

18:51.536 --> 18:55.135
No. We need to talk now.

19:00.076 --> 19:01.613
[motorist 1] What happened?

19:01.645 --> 19:03.079
[motorist 2] My God,
is she okay?

19:03.114 --> 19:04.782
[motorist 3]
Does she has a pulse?

19:04.816 --> 19:07.117
[motorist 1]
Thank God, she's alive.

19:07.151 --> 19:08.219
[gasps]

19:08.220 --> 19:09.220
[motorist 1]
Stay on the ground, honey.

19:09.220 --> 19:10.387
You've been in an accident.

19:10.387 --> 19:11.689
Paramedics are on their way.

19:11.689 --> 19:13.423
[motorist 3] I didn't see her.
She came out of nowhere.

19:13.423 --> 19:14.991
I'm okay. God...

19:15.025 --> 19:16.227
Just... Just stay put.

19:16.259 --> 19:17.394
Get off!

19:17.428 --> 19:19.329
I'm calling 911.

19:19.363 --> 19:21.865
Hello, I have a young woman
here who was hit by a car.

19:21.898 --> 19:22.932
[groaning]

19:22.967 --> 19:26.671
[bones cracking]

19:26.703 --> 19:29.140
-[grunts]
-[motorist 1] What the hell?

19:29.173 --> 19:31.094
[motorist 2]
Her foot looked broken.

19:38.915 --> 19:41.752
[sighs]

19:41.786 --> 19:44.821
Oh, my God.
What happened, boo?

19:44.821 --> 19:45.821
I got hit by a car.

19:45.823 --> 19:46.857
What?

19:46.891 --> 19:48.192
-[sighs]
-Yeah, I flew like 20 feet
in the air,

19:48.224 --> 19:49.693
and then pancaked
into a minivan.

19:49.727 --> 19:51.362
Jesus, we need to go to the ER.

19:51.394 --> 19:54.265
I don't need to. I'm not hurt.

19:54.298 --> 19:58.102
Matter of fact, I'm never hurt.

19:58.134 --> 20:00.438
Why is that, Mom?

20:00.471 --> 20:02.105
I don't know.

20:02.138 --> 20:04.409
You're very lucky, I guess.

20:04.442 --> 20:05.710
I've been hit by a car,

20:05.710 --> 20:07.211
I've jumped off
the science building,

20:07.211 --> 20:09.212
and I've nose-dived
into a gravel pit

20:09.247 --> 20:10.948
without getting hurt.

20:10.980 --> 20:13.718
I'm a total freak.

20:13.751 --> 20:16.921
I think it's time you told me
about the other side
of my family.

20:16.922 --> 20:18.855
We agreed we'd wait.

20:18.855 --> 20:19.723
No, I can't wait.

20:19.723 --> 20:22.526
I wanna know
who my real father is.

20:22.527 --> 20:24.461
Look, I have questions.

20:24.494 --> 20:26.096
Questions that you can't answer

20:26.096 --> 20:27.397
or won't.

20:27.397 --> 20:30.067
You know Gary and I
love you very much.

20:30.101 --> 20:32.500
-Mom...
-[sighs]

20:35.506 --> 20:40.506
Your real father was a man
from another life.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.349
I hardly knew him.

20:46.384 --> 20:48.183
[door opens]

21:00.263 --> 21:05.169
[keys clatter]

21:05.201 --> 21:07.371
Look what I found.

21:07.404 --> 21:08.739
[Rose] Dad...

21:08.771 --> 21:10.122
I'm Rose.

21:16.948 --> 21:20.684
Mom said you wouldn't be
thrilled to see me.

21:20.718 --> 21:22.553
I was even less enthused
about the idea,

21:22.553 --> 21:24.954
but I figured, what the hell?

21:24.989 --> 21:26.338
Leave us.

21:35.132 --> 21:37.082
[door closes]

21:48.445 --> 21:49.980
[Slade]
You shouldn't play with that.

21:50.013 --> 21:52.849
Somebody could get hurt.

21:52.883 --> 21:53.884
[gun clicks]

21:53.916 --> 21:56.019
I can't hurt you.

21:56.053 --> 21:57.421
I didn't mean me.

21:57.454 --> 22:00.023
I can't hurt me either.

22:00.057 --> 22:03.894
[gun cocks]

22:03.926 --> 22:05.895
[screams]

22:05.929 --> 22:08.179
[Rose groaning]

22:12.369 --> 22:13.936
Hi, Daddy-o.

22:13.971 --> 22:15.320
[panting]

22:20.377 --> 22:23.113
I have questions.

22:23.146 --> 22:26.150
Yeah?

22:26.182 --> 22:29.319
We can start with this.

22:29.353 --> 22:30.721
I'm a freak.

22:30.755 --> 22:34.958
[Slade] The circus
always needs us.

22:34.991 --> 22:39.529
Beats cubicle work.

22:39.564 --> 22:42.465
You and my mom?

22:42.500 --> 22:46.171
I was married at the time.

22:46.203 --> 22:51.203
She was just the last call
at the Kansas City Radisson.

22:51.275 --> 22:53.525
It wasn't love.

22:59.115 --> 23:02.720
Go home and don't come back.

23:02.753 --> 23:05.355
If you do, I'll hurt you.

23:05.388 --> 23:07.038
I know how.

23:11.561 --> 23:14.561
I can hurt you, too.

23:19.135 --> 23:21.086
[door closes]

23:24.474 --> 23:28.012
[laughing]
You look amazing, boo.

23:28.046 --> 23:31.182
I don't feel amazing.
I feel like a fraud.

23:31.215 --> 23:33.884
Well, this boy Todd of yours
doesn't think you're a fraud.

23:33.917 --> 23:36.220
That's 'cause
he doesn't know me.

23:36.220 --> 23:37.221
I wish Dad were here.

23:37.221 --> 23:40.590
You know your father
never misses a tee time.

23:40.625 --> 23:43.326
My real father.

23:43.361 --> 23:44.461
Forget him.

23:44.494 --> 23:47.330
[car horn honking]

23:47.365 --> 23:49.098
[Mei] Fuck me.

23:49.133 --> 23:50.667
Well played, Todd.

23:50.701 --> 23:54.672
[Mei laughing]

23:54.705 --> 23:56.240
-Got money?
-Mmm-hmm.

23:56.272 --> 23:57.474
-Lip gloss?
-Yeah.

23:57.508 --> 23:59.210
-Condoms?
-[scoffs] Mom!

23:59.242 --> 24:02.445
[Mei] Sorry.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.180
[thunder rumbling]

24:11.454 --> 24:13.404
Where's Todd?

24:16.493 --> 24:19.564
[sighs] What is this?

24:19.596 --> 24:21.398
It's a peace offering.

24:21.432 --> 24:24.268
-I have a date.
-[doors lock]

24:24.300 --> 24:26.436
[sighs]

24:26.470 --> 24:28.006
I'm sorry.

24:28.038 --> 24:31.843
You came a long way to see me,
and I treated you like shit.

24:31.843 --> 24:33.010
I thought it was for the best.

24:33.010 --> 24:36.646
-Best for who?
-[Slade] For you.

24:36.681 --> 24:38.982
My job's a little irregular.

24:39.017 --> 24:41.752
I make enemies.
People who want to kill me.

24:41.786 --> 24:43.755
So get a new career.

24:43.788 --> 24:45.390
Maybe the circus.

24:45.423 --> 24:49.160
Thing is, if you come with me,
they might want to kill you, too.

24:49.193 --> 24:51.828
Who said anything
about going with you?

24:51.863 --> 24:53.497
I have a family here.

24:53.530 --> 24:56.299
[Slade] Yeah, I see.

24:56.299 --> 24:58.435
But they're not like you,

24:58.469 --> 25:00.471
and I am.

25:00.503 --> 25:02.373
I was altered in the military.

25:02.405 --> 25:05.008
They managed
a few improvements.

25:05.041 --> 25:07.344
I'm hard to kill,

25:07.344 --> 25:08.679
and so are you.

25:08.712 --> 25:11.182
Great. Next time, text.

25:11.215 --> 25:13.517
[Slade] I could tell you
more about yourself,

25:13.550 --> 25:15.352
show you.

25:15.385 --> 25:19.355
You should come live with me.

25:19.390 --> 25:21.491
I'll take care of you.

25:21.525 --> 25:23.560
You'll feel normal.

25:23.594 --> 25:26.195
Do you realize
how crazy this is?

25:26.195 --> 25:27.097
I mean, for starters,

25:27.097 --> 25:28.633
Mom would probably call
the police.

25:28.665 --> 25:31.134
[Slade] Yeah,
I can arrange things with her.

25:31.134 --> 25:32.036
Really?

25:32.036 --> 25:33.305
[Slade] I bought this house.

25:33.337 --> 25:35.538
I pay all your bills,
plus the club membership.

25:35.573 --> 25:37.040
I always have.

25:37.075 --> 25:39.375
You can get out
and ask your mother.

25:39.410 --> 25:41.511
You pay for Gary to play golf?

25:41.545 --> 25:45.650
[Slade] Seems to
make him happy.

25:45.682 --> 25:49.286
Look, I wasn't ready
to be a father.

25:49.319 --> 25:51.323
I am now.

25:51.355 --> 25:56.355
Now, that being said,
if you wanna live here
and have a normal life,

25:58.930 --> 26:03.000
I'll never bother you again.

26:03.032 --> 26:05.102
Todd's here.

26:05.134 --> 26:07.835
[car horn honking]

26:10.907 --> 26:14.679
[honking intensifies]

26:14.711 --> 26:15.711
Drive.

26:23.354 --> 26:25.903
[Slade] Go ahead.

26:33.131 --> 26:36.500
I figured you were
about a two or a four.

26:36.534 --> 26:39.871
I had to guess your size.

26:39.903 --> 26:42.707
I hope it fits.

26:42.740 --> 26:46.039
It's not a prom dress.

26:48.211 --> 26:51.211
What does that mean?

27:02.393 --> 27:06.564
[alarm blaring]

27:06.596 --> 27:11.096
-[Deathstroke] Rose!
-[grunts]

27:48.239 --> 27:53.239
-[both grunting]
-[rock music playing]

28:03.621 --> 28:04.821
[groans]

28:04.855 --> 28:06.205
[panting]

28:16.599 --> 28:21.599
Right, 'cause crying
always helps.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.690
[both grunting]

28:40.324 --> 28:41.523
[groans]

28:45.596 --> 28:47.832
[groaning]

28:47.865 --> 28:51.067
[grunts]

28:51.101 --> 28:52.670
Again!

28:52.702 --> 28:54.702
[Rose] Why am I doing this?

28:56.039 --> 29:00.539
I mean, is it general fuckery,
or there a goal?

29:10.386 --> 29:13.824
[Slade] I had a son.

29:13.857 --> 29:17.961
His name was Jericho.

29:17.994 --> 29:20.463
He was my life.

29:20.497 --> 29:24.902
I have a brother?

29:24.935 --> 29:28.873
He was murdered.

29:28.905 --> 29:31.241
Sorry.

29:31.276 --> 29:33.477
[Slade] He was killed by, uh...

29:33.509 --> 29:36.413
a gang of psychopaths.

29:36.446 --> 29:38.115
Highly trained.

29:38.148 --> 29:41.885
Call themselves the Titans.

29:41.919 --> 29:46.568
So, this gang, that's the goal?

29:47.125 --> 29:52.125
You're the only family
I have left.

29:52.797 --> 29:55.066
I need some new clothes.

29:55.098 --> 30:00.098
Underwear, socks,
stuff like that.

30:01.205 --> 30:03.941
[Slade] Your bank account.

30:03.974 --> 30:08.546
Your PIN is your birthday.

30:08.578 --> 30:13.250
You know my birthday?

30:13.282 --> 30:14.986
Rest up.

30:15.019 --> 30:17.568
Big day tomorrow.

30:30.034 --> 30:32.336
He gave me a bank account.

30:32.369 --> 30:35.173
More money
than I could ever spend.

30:35.205 --> 30:38.541
I helped him break out
Dr. Light, and then...

30:38.576 --> 30:41.726
he asked me for more.

30:43.714 --> 30:47.817
[Slade] You did very well
with the prison guards.

30:47.852 --> 30:51.355
The crooked strikes,
the rising cuts.

30:51.355 --> 30:52.990
Thanks.

30:53.023 --> 30:55.527
Dr. Light will round
them up for us,

30:55.559 --> 30:59.029
and we'll be ready
for our next step.

30:59.063 --> 31:00.698
Next step?

31:00.730 --> 31:02.833
[Slade] The Titans
broke my family.

31:02.833 --> 31:05.603
So I'm gonna break theirs
from the inside.

31:05.635 --> 31:08.105
It'll be surgical,

31:08.138 --> 31:12.242
and you'll be my scalpel.

31:12.277 --> 31:14.411
You want me to kill them?

31:14.444 --> 31:16.646
Just join them.

31:16.680 --> 31:17.782
Once you're inside,

31:17.816 --> 31:19.785
we'll turn them
against each other,
one by one.

31:19.817 --> 31:24.188
So I just knock on their door
and say, "Hey, Titans,
I'd like to sign up"?

31:24.221 --> 31:28.393
Their leader, Dick Grayson,
he's got a weakness for strays.

31:28.425 --> 31:30.760
Especially ones
that need to be saved.

31:30.795 --> 31:32.261
Saved from what?

31:32.296 --> 31:34.132
From me.

31:34.164 --> 31:38.669
They're going to find
you and me fighting,

31:38.701 --> 31:41.337
and I'm gonna cut out your eye.

31:41.371 --> 31:42.372
[scoffs]

31:42.405 --> 31:44.842
Funny.

31:44.875 --> 31:48.011
You're too pretty anyway.

31:48.045 --> 31:49.394
Fuck you.

31:58.656 --> 32:01.558
I wish I could
take it all back,
but I can't.

32:01.593 --> 32:05.895
Look, what I did hurt people,
and it hurt you.

32:05.895 --> 32:07.164
But when I came
to Titans Tower,

32:07.164 --> 32:10.433
I tried to do
what my dad wanted, but then...

32:10.467 --> 32:12.036
this happened.

32:12.068 --> 32:14.204
So what?

32:14.238 --> 32:17.275
Some of us is true
and some of us isn't?

32:17.307 --> 32:18.476
No, no, no, this is true.

32:18.476 --> 32:20.243
You and me, the last few days,
it's all true.

32:20.243 --> 32:22.579
You know what, Rose,
maybe you can go
through it all, huh?

32:22.579 --> 32:24.248
Maybe you can fucking
underline the parts

32:24.248 --> 32:25.582
where you
weren't fucking lying?

32:25.582 --> 32:26.451
Jason.

32:26.451 --> 32:29.354
What the fuck
was I thinking, huh?

32:29.354 --> 32:31.455
I'm such an asshole, huh?

32:31.455 --> 32:32.690
I took you
to that fucking school,

32:32.691 --> 32:35.425
I told you
all my fucking secrets, huh?

32:35.460 --> 32:40.460
What, was it part
of Daddy's training
to fuck me the whole time?

32:40.663 --> 32:41.833
I'm done with this shit.

32:41.866 --> 32:45.202
Look, none of this was supposed
to happen, it just did.

32:45.236 --> 32:47.637
-Get the fuck off me.
-[both grunt]

32:47.671 --> 32:50.520
[breathing heavily]

32:54.111 --> 32:59.111
[Rose] Come on, fight me.
You know you want to.

32:59.916 --> 33:01.717
Are we done?

33:06.824 --> 33:10.874
-We're done.
-[Rose crying]

33:12.262 --> 33:14.097
Where are you going?

33:14.131 --> 33:15.766
Look, the Titans need us.

33:15.766 --> 33:17.835
Fuck them, Rose.

33:17.867 --> 33:21.700
Fuck all of you.

33:21.806 --> 33:26.243
[door slams]

33:26.277 --> 33:31.182
[continues crying]

33:31.214 --> 33:32.583
[sniffles]

33:32.615 --> 33:35.615
[cell phone ringing]

33:41.625 --> 33:43.059
Jason?

33:43.094 --> 33:45.296
[Slade] <i>He's gone</i>
<i>to meet his friends.</i>

33:45.296 --> 33:48.365
<i>The Titans are putting</i>
<i>the band back together.</i>

33:48.398 --> 33:50.867
<i>We should put ours</i>
<i>back together, too.</i>

33:50.901 --> 33:52.135
Dad?

33:52.170 --> 33:57.170
<i>-Get to San Francisco now.</i>
-[line disconnects]

34:04.615 --> 34:06.683
-[Slade] How many?
-[Wintergreen] Trickling in.

34:06.683 --> 34:07.652
Two so far.

34:07.652 --> 34:09.119
Wonder Girl
and the one they call Dove.

34:09.119 --> 34:11.021
Rest are scattered.

34:11.054 --> 34:12.356
Grayson's still in the wind?

34:12.389 --> 34:14.157
No sign of him yet.

34:14.192 --> 34:16.159
Nevada State PD
and the Feds are in the mix.

34:16.193 --> 34:18.195
No, they won't find him,

34:18.228 --> 34:20.798
but you will find his friends.

34:20.831 --> 34:25.831
Brought a little something
to greet him with.

34:44.822 --> 34:48.722
[Adeline] Want some water?

34:51.094 --> 34:53.045
[door closes]

35:04.809 --> 35:08.413
Half the state of Nevada
is looking for you.

35:08.445 --> 35:12.048
I knew exactly where'd you be.

35:12.083 --> 35:13.317
Where's Slade?

35:13.351 --> 35:14.885
[Adeline] San Francisco.

35:14.885 --> 35:17.422
Wintergreen told him
that your friends
are getting back together.

35:17.454 --> 35:20.525
-He's gone to kill all of the Titans.
-When?

35:20.557 --> 35:24.161
He left this morning,
right after he called
his daughter.

35:24.195 --> 35:25.463
Slade called Rose?

35:25.496 --> 35:28.965
Yeah, it sounded like
they were working together.

35:28.965 --> 35:29.967
For how long?

35:29.967 --> 35:31.402
[Adeline]
I didn't get any details.

35:31.402 --> 35:34.105
I just overheard
a few phone conversations.

35:34.137 --> 35:36.541
Jesus.

35:36.541 --> 35:39.376
I fought for her to stay.

35:39.409 --> 35:43.380
I swore she needed us.

35:43.414 --> 35:47.485
[laughs] He played me,

35:47.518 --> 35:49.554
and I missed it all.

35:49.586 --> 35:52.123
[Adeline] Yeah,
that's what he does.

35:52.155 --> 35:54.690
He uses people.

35:54.724 --> 35:57.594
Hurts them.

35:57.628 --> 36:00.465
[scoffs] Even his own son.

36:00.498 --> 36:02.932
I missed Jericho, too,

36:02.967 --> 36:04.735
trying to talk to me

36:04.768 --> 36:05.971
in your living room.

36:06.003 --> 36:08.405
[scoffs] It was all
right there in front of me.

36:08.438 --> 36:12.175
I missed all the signs, too.

36:12.208 --> 36:16.347
At first.

36:16.380 --> 36:19.250
But he's in there.

36:19.282 --> 36:23.420
[voice breaking] My son...
He's in there,

36:23.454 --> 36:26.757
and I don't know
how to help him.

36:26.789 --> 36:28.791
Maybe I can.

36:28.791 --> 36:32.329
Jericho told me...

36:32.362 --> 36:35.599
that you had some kind
of special talent.

36:35.632 --> 36:37.201
That you could almost fly,

36:37.235 --> 36:38.802
take down legions of bad men,

36:38.836 --> 36:41.172
that you could do
the impossible.

36:41.204 --> 36:44.141
Well, I've got one for you,
Mr. Grayson.

36:44.175 --> 36:47.945
Bring my son

36:47.978 --> 36:52.250
back to me.

36:52.282 --> 36:56.987
[sighs] I'll try.

36:57.021 --> 36:59.789
[audience cheering]

36:59.822 --> 37:02.193
[grunts]

37:02.226 --> 37:04.061
-What are you doing?
-Paid my money.

37:04.094 --> 37:05.429
I came to fight.

37:05.463 --> 37:06.898
It's not funny.

37:06.898 --> 37:09.065
You wanted to stop
the cycle of violence,
I'm here to help.

37:09.099 --> 37:13.170
[both grunting]

37:13.204 --> 37:16.072
Truth is,
you don't mind the violence.

37:16.106 --> 37:19.777
[both grunting]

37:19.809 --> 37:21.445
[groans]

37:21.478 --> 37:23.947
It's me you mind.

37:23.981 --> 37:26.617
[yells]

37:26.650 --> 37:29.420
That's not true. I love you.

37:29.454 --> 37:33.157
[both grunting]

37:33.190 --> 37:36.827
I know you do,
but you like being high
just a little bit more.

37:36.860 --> 37:38.027
[grunting]

37:38.061 --> 37:39.230
One of us had to go.

37:39.262 --> 37:40.597
[both grunt]

37:40.632 --> 37:44.668
-[bones crack]
-[screams]

37:44.702 --> 37:46.670
-[audience cheering]
-I'm working on it.

37:46.702 --> 37:47.704
Too late.

37:47.739 --> 37:51.639
-[grunts]
-[Hawk groaning]

37:52.809 --> 37:54.311
Dawn!

37:54.344 --> 37:55.695
[panting]

38:19.336 --> 38:21.436
[bells jingle]

38:26.577 --> 38:31.449
Hey, Stu, how you been?

38:31.481 --> 38:34.818
[Dick sighs]

38:34.853 --> 38:37.387
I, uh, need
a new pair of shoes.

38:37.420 --> 38:40.925
Sorry, I don't make
those anymore.

38:40.958 --> 38:43.393
Look, I don't have
a lot of time.

38:43.427 --> 38:46.364
[clears throat]

38:46.396 --> 38:48.967
I'm in the fruitcake trade now.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.302
Just haven't had time
to change the signage.

38:52.335 --> 38:54.304
Okay. [chuckles]

38:54.338 --> 38:55.706
I need a new fruitcake.

38:55.739 --> 39:00.739
The maligning
of the fruitcake,
I will never understand.

39:01.211 --> 39:02.711
Come here.

39:06.583 --> 39:08.452
Look, I'm sorry.

39:08.485 --> 39:11.588
Oh, don't be sorry.

39:11.621 --> 39:13.056
Have a slice.

39:13.090 --> 39:16.427
[sighs] It wasn't personal.

39:16.460 --> 39:20.164
Fruitcake is my life.

39:20.197 --> 39:21.798
My passion.

39:21.798 --> 39:23.300
I mean, if you don't like
my work, you--

39:23.300 --> 39:25.469
I love your work.

39:25.503 --> 39:27.038
That's why I came back here.

39:27.072 --> 39:30.074
Would you like to
put a match to this
before you have a slice?

39:30.106 --> 39:32.610
Oh, wait, I know.

39:32.643 --> 39:35.945
Sure, this should do it.

39:35.978 --> 39:37.380
Right?

39:37.414 --> 39:38.782
There.

39:38.815 --> 39:43.815
That's how Dick
likes his fruitcake.

39:45.923 --> 39:50.695
I'm sorry I burned your suit.

39:50.728 --> 39:54.666
I need your help, Stu.

39:54.699 --> 39:57.534
I need another one.

39:57.568 --> 40:00.568
Something different.

40:04.675 --> 40:07.913
Well, Master Wayne said
you'd be coming.

40:07.913 --> 40:09.547
Of course he did.

40:09.579 --> 40:13.179
-[door buzzes]
-Come on.

40:15.985 --> 40:17.320
Hey, Lily.

40:17.355 --> 40:20.224
Hi, Dick.

40:20.257 --> 40:21.425
Burning the suit?

40:21.425 --> 40:22.559
I had a bad day.

40:22.592 --> 40:23.695
Drama queen.

40:23.728 --> 40:26.898
We're moving on, Lily.
All behind us now.

40:26.931 --> 40:31.536
Let's show Dick
what Master Wayne
had us put together.

40:31.568 --> 40:33.704
It's a Nomex,
triple-weave Kevlar shell,

40:33.737 --> 40:35.940
electrically insulated
and light-sensitive.

40:35.974 --> 40:38.108
It has fewer body inlays
than the old one,

40:38.143 --> 40:41.679

utilize your circus skills.

40:41.713 --> 40:44.581
"Move more, get hit less."
That was our mantra.

40:44.614 --> 40:49.586
I like that mantra.

You've outdone yourselves.

[keypad beeping]

41:52.315 --> 41:54.518
Hey, man.

41:54.552 --> 41:56.621
Were you here
when the holdup happened?

41:56.653 --> 41:58.989
No, but I'm glad I missed it.

41:59.023 --> 42:01.492
Hawk was my favorite Titan.

42:01.525 --> 42:02.960
Come on, man, this wasn't Hawk.

42:02.994 --> 42:05.128
Some jackass
in a Halloween costume.

42:05.161 --> 42:07.063
No, bro, it was him.

42:07.097 --> 42:08.833
Dude's a mess.

42:08.865 --> 42:10.601
Fighting in his suit for blow.

42:10.635 --> 42:13.369
No wonder Dove left him.

42:13.403 --> 42:14.704
He left her.

42:14.739 --> 42:17.407
Sure he tells himself that.

42:17.407 --> 42:18.775
Man, I'm sure
Hawk's not a saint,

42:18.775 --> 42:21.177
but he's not stealing
detergent from...

42:21.177 --> 42:22.313
Bubble Me This.

42:22.313 --> 42:23.313
From Bubble Me This.

to believe it either,

another addict with Instagram.

Yeah, bro.

[mimics bird squawking]

43:04.188 --> 43:05.356
[laughing] Sorry.

43:05.389 --> 43:08.025
Okay, so, um...
That laundromat from earlier,

43:08.059 --> 43:13.059
that was actually
a money-laundering front
for a meth lab in Boswick.

43:13.329 --> 43:15.132
[laughs] Yeah. So, um,

43:15.166 --> 43:17.367
I guess we're cleaning up
this neighborhood.

How old are you?

Uh, 17.

Or I will be 17 next summer.

My mom's new dude
doesn't really like me.
He just...

He says stuff like,

44:02.079 --> 44:05.849
"You're not worth the calories
you eat," and it's just that...

No.

44:13.257 --> 44:16.860
No, man, I was out there
laying some Titans law.

44:16.860 --> 44:18.628
You held up a laundromat.

44:18.663 --> 44:21.097
What kind of message
does that send?

44:21.130 --> 44:23.367
That I...

44:23.400 --> 44:25.969
Sorry. So, wait.
Should I have killed them?

44:26.003 --> 44:27.204
Like killed? Like...

44:27.237 --> 44:30.175
No, you shouldn't have
killed them.

44:30.208 --> 44:33.978
Stealing and killing
is not the Titans way.

44:43.554 --> 44:45.588
So can I have my money back?

44:45.623 --> 44:47.490
Your money back?

44:47.525 --> 44:48.759
You stole my suit.

44:48.793 --> 44:52.697
No, I didn't steal it.
You sold it to me.

44:52.731 --> 44:55.932
Remember, you were
in the parking lot
with that lady,

44:55.967 --> 44:57.802
and then you asked me...

44:57.802 --> 44:59.469
You asked me
where I could score some blow,

44:59.471 --> 45:03.273
and if I wanted to buy
the suit for 200 bucks.

45:03.306 --> 45:04.775
You're lying.

45:04.809 --> 45:06.777
No, I'm not.

45:06.811 --> 45:11.548
I swear.

45:11.581 --> 45:13.251
I'll pay you back next week.

45:13.284 --> 45:16.786
Well... I mean,
you don't have to.

45:16.820 --> 45:18.789
Like... [sighs]

45:18.789 --> 45:22.260
It was a privilege
to wear the Hawk.

45:22.293 --> 45:24.961
Seriously, for the first time,
I felt like I knew

45:24.996 --> 45:27.164
exactly who I was

45:27.197 --> 45:30.902
and what I was supposed to do.

45:30.934 --> 45:35.438
You must feel
like that every day.

45:35.472 --> 45:38.307
Yeah.

45:38.307 --> 45:39.842
Every day.

45:47.617 --> 45:50.353
Well, go Titans.

45:50.387 --> 45:53.023
Go Titans. [laughing]

45:53.056 --> 45:56.326
That was Hawk in my place.

45:56.360 --> 45:59.563
Cool.

and a blonde.

They delivered my sushi,
then they wanted
to see my hydrofoil.

46:54.684 --> 46:55.987
Two ladies did this to you?

46:56.019 --> 46:57.922
[Walter] I guess so.

46:57.954 --> 46:59.956
Attractive? These sushi girls?

46:59.990 --> 47:03.760
[hesitatingly] Yeah,
you could say so.

Not these two?

Uh...

47:08.498 --> 47:10.333
