Mr. Kapoor, hello,
good morning, sir.

01:15.716 --> 01:16.676
Yes, hey,

01:16.778 --> 01:18.347
I've got the Garden City
proposal laid out

01:18.449 --> 01:19.578
right here in front of me,
and, sir,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.586
it is more
than just an investment.

01:21.689 --> 01:22.687
Uh, what?

01:23.223 --> 01:26.352
Of course, I'm at the office.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.187
<i>♪ Precious Jesus ♪</i>

01:28.423 --> 01:31.031
No, yeah, you know what?

01:31.133 --> 01:33.033
I'm sorry,
it just got really loud in here.

01:33.169 --> 01:35.701
Uh, I will, uh, I'll call you
back tomorrow.

01:35.903 --> 01:37.938
I apologize, thank you.

01:38.040 --> 01:44.777
<i>♪ O for grace</i>
<i>To trust Him more ♪</i>

01:44.979 --> 01:48.281
Amen and amen, take your seats.

01:52.551 --> 01:55.485
Before we dismiss,
I have a few announcements

01:55.587 --> 01:58.952
for you, church family,
first, parking violations.

01:59.354 --> 02:00.920
Take off your visor.

02:02.458 --> 02:03.830
-And your cleats.
-Why?

02:03.965 --> 02:05.262
So I can smack you with them.

02:05.364 --> 02:06.525
...and an appointment
with Jesus

02:06.627 --> 02:08.035
when I sweat through my Dockers.

02:08.137 --> 02:10.499
Don't worry,
we'll give you a spray bottle

02:10.601 --> 02:12.231
-and some sunscreen.
-What was the sermon

02:12.333 --> 02:13.402
about today?

02:13.504 --> 02:16.172
Forgiveness,
here, you can practice.

02:16.408 --> 02:18.474
Okay.
I'm sorry.

02:18.610 --> 02:21.742
And I cannot endorse
this announcement enough,

02:22.044 --> 02:27.049
Family Camp at Lake Katokwah
is the highlight of our year.

02:27.217 --> 02:28.218
You ask our family,

02:28.353 --> 02:29.821
it's the greatest place
on earth.

02:30.457 --> 02:32.820
So, they've literally
never been to Disney?

02:33.489 --> 02:35.893
I'm sorry I was late.

02:35.995 --> 02:37.557
-Again.
-Okay.

02:37.893 --> 02:40.032
Well, what do I gotta do
to make it up to you?

02:40.134 --> 02:41.164
Zip lines,
the whole nine.

02:41.266 --> 02:42.934
There's lots of things to do.

02:43.103 --> 02:44.502
How about we go to that camp?

02:45.304 --> 02:47.106
-Church camp?
-Yes.

02:47.442 --> 02:49.536
How about we go someplace
that has air conditioning?

02:49.972 --> 02:54.773
Just look at those cabins,
ice cold air conditioning.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.747
-Can I get an amen?

02:56.916 --> 02:58.313
Amen.

02:58.782 --> 03:01.413
Still, Henry would hate it
and Hannah's too old.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.318
It doesn't matter
how old your kids are.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.055
-Huh.
-Our daughter's 19

03:05.157 --> 03:06.555
and she is more pumped

03:06.658 --> 03:08.291
for camp this year
than ever, right, sweetie?

03:08.393 --> 03:10.093
-Woo-woo!
-Woo-woo, sugar bear.

03:10.228 --> 03:11.191
-Woo-woo.

03:11.293 --> 03:12.428
Okay, well,

03:12.597 --> 03:13.859
it's just the weird families
who go to camp.

03:13.962 --> 03:15.967
I know, you might think
we're a little weird.

03:16.102 --> 03:17.369
-Come on!

03:17.671 --> 03:20.800
But if you can honestly say
there's nothing more important

03:20.903 --> 03:24.540
than investing
in your family, then show up.

03:24.642 --> 03:26.710
That might look
a little weird to the world.

03:27.246 --> 03:29.312
So camp signups starts today.

03:29.748 --> 03:32.145
Let's get out there
and have some fun this summer.

03:32.347 --> 03:33.683
Okay, families?

03:34.917 --> 03:37.857
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hold on, hey!

03:38.260 --> 03:39.552
Hey, you weren't serious
about that whole,

03:39.654 --> 03:41.060
uh, Family Camp thing, right?

03:41.329 --> 03:43.257
I mean, church camp
is just so Jesus-y.

03:43.660 --> 03:45.862
Says the man
standing in a church.

03:46.432 --> 03:49.034
Yeah,
this is where Jesus belongs,

03:49.169 --> 03:51.030
not camping in a tent with me.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.701
Oh, gosh, Tommy.

03:52.937 --> 03:55.403
Grace, Grace, Grace, Grace,
Grace, Grace, wait, listen.

03:55.972 --> 03:58.277
If I seal this next deal,
I'm a shoo-in for partner,

03:58.380 --> 04:00.040
and then I'll take you
wherever you want to go,

04:00.476 --> 04:02.041
-Hawaii, Paris?

04:02.143 --> 04:05.319
Come on, people, I need a nap
and a buffet, chop chop.

04:05.554 --> 04:08.721
-Aw, so no bingo today, Grandpa?

04:09.557 --> 04:13.025
Tommy, I don't want a vacation.
I want my husband back.

04:13.127 --> 04:14.724
What are you talking about?

04:15.792 --> 04:18.063
We barely get to see you,
and when we do,

04:18.165 --> 04:19.760
you're not present, you've...

04:19.862 --> 04:21.665
you've got a phone
in front of your face

04:21.767 --> 04:25.364
-or you're talking about golf.
-Golf closes deals.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.467
No deals, no meals.

04:27.870 --> 04:29.337
Did you just come up
with that yourself?

04:29.539 --> 04:30.671
-Uh--
-Don't answer that.

04:30.840 --> 04:34.012
Listen, I really appreciate
all that you do

04:34.114 --> 04:35.778
to provide for our family.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.350
But I'm getting really tired

04:38.452 --> 04:41.322
of surviving
on your emotional leftovers.

04:41.988 --> 04:43.885
Okay, okay.

04:46.256 --> 04:47.660
I'll fix it.

04:48.262 --> 04:50.527
Okay, well,
why don't you start

04:50.629 --> 04:52.662
by taking
your little clickety clacketies

04:52.764 --> 04:54.496
and marching right back in there
and signing us up

04:54.598 --> 04:56.535
-for Family Camp?

04:57.104 --> 04:58.236
-What?
-You're so cute.

04:58.338 --> 05:00.666
-Oh.
-No, no, seriously, listen.

05:01.169 --> 05:05.507
I love you, but, babe,
let's get one thing straight.

05:05.976 --> 05:09.708
There's absolutely no way
that I am ever going to...

05:09.811 --> 05:13.781
<i>♪ Carry on, my wayward son ♪</i>

05:13.884 --> 05:18.057

05:28.768 --> 05:31.467
Teenage girl found here
in her natural habitat,

05:31.569 --> 05:32.698
-performing one of many...

05:32.800 --> 05:34.273
...fruitless grooming rituals.

05:34.475 --> 05:35.734
-Hey, Dad, can you please

05:35.836 --> 05:37.343
tell Henry to stop filming me?

05:37.512 --> 05:39.072
Henry, stop filming
your sister, it's creepy.

05:39.174 --> 05:42.112
Don't call him creepy,
he's my budding little artist.

05:42.247 --> 05:43.281
Cut it out, Henry.

05:43.650 --> 05:46.384
He's calling him creepy
because it's creepy, Mom.

05:46.486 --> 05:48.655
What's creepy
is your selfie phase.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.061
Okay, idiot, let's go.

05:55.264 --> 05:57.093
Hey,
don't call your kid an idiot.

05:57.195 --> 05:58.297
No, no, no,

05:58.633 --> 06:00.332
it's that Dale Earnhardt Jr.
here trying to pass us.

06:04.433 --> 06:06.902
Hmm?

06:09.677 --> 06:11.438
-I think that's gonna hit us.

06:11.540 --> 06:13.076
-Oh!

06:13.445 --> 06:16.379
Get that spit stick off of me!

06:16.515 --> 06:18.848
-Uh!

06:19.150 --> 06:20.454
Tommy!

06:22.149 --> 06:26.752
-At last, you little...

06:32.632 --> 06:34.526
That feel good?
You had to do that, right?

06:34.795 --> 06:35.928
-Yeah.
-Mom,

06:36.131 --> 06:38.205
Henry got his nasty candy
all over my face.

06:38.340 --> 06:40.469
It matches
your makeup job perfectly.

06:41.972 --> 06:43.541
I just want to eat
my pistachios in peace, please.

06:43.643 --> 06:45.039
...that I'm wearing
a seatbelt right now.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.111
-Guys, hush, come on.

06:47.213 --> 06:48.147
No talking.

06:48.249 --> 06:49.615
You're the annoying one!

06:49.717 --> 06:53.883
-<i> Hey, you knock it off!</i>

06:54.918 --> 06:58.189
Here we are, guys,
Camp Katokwah.

06:58.692 --> 07:01.224
-Dad, I'm sorry.
-For what, bud?

07:01.726 --> 07:04.360
I think I'm car sick.

07:04.462 --> 07:06.926
Oh, Henry, oh!

07:17.442 --> 07:18.776
Come on, guys.

07:20.515 --> 07:23.148
Hey, family,
welcome to camp, last name?

07:23.584 --> 07:26.586
-We're the Ackermans with an A.
-Ackermans.

07:27.689 --> 07:29.986
I don't seem to have
an Ackerman here on the list.

07:30.689 --> 07:32.285
You made
the final payment online, right?

07:32.454 --> 07:33.456
-Hmm?

07:33.591 --> 07:36.492
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

07:36.594 --> 07:37.826
Listen, it happens all the time.

07:38.062 --> 07:40.564
The good news is, we have
yet to turn a family away.

07:40.666 --> 07:43.432
-Yeah?
-So don't worry.

07:43.834 --> 07:46.237
But we're out of cabins,
imagine that.

07:46.406 --> 07:48.339
-Oh, I'm imagining that.
-Ow.

07:48.775 --> 07:50.872
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna give you one word

07:51.007 --> 07:52.644
and you're gonna tell me
the very first thing

07:52.779 --> 07:58.849
-that you think of.

07:59.484 --> 08:01.183
-Yurt.
-No.

08:01.418 --> 08:02.587
We'll take it.

08:02.756 --> 08:04.118
Actually, let's go
for round two here, guys.

08:04.220 --> 08:08.960
-Buckle up, everybody.
-Three words, sharing a yurt.

08:09.496 --> 08:12.425
-Huh?
-With another family.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.267
Oh, that makes it better.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.768
How? How does it make it better?

08:16.870 --> 08:19.735
It's fine, it's fine,
it's... it's fine, it's fine.

08:20.004 --> 08:23.039
I'm telling you guys,
you're gonna love this.

08:23.875 --> 08:25.546
All right,
looks like we're here.

08:28.416 --> 08:31.684
You guys, it's beautiful.

08:32.619 --> 08:35.483
Yeah, it's a luxury resort
for possums.

08:35.785 --> 08:36.983
Guys, this is glamping.

08:37.152 --> 08:38.857
Honey, I've always wanted
to go glamping.

08:38.959 --> 08:41.423
Great, let's go home. I'll throw
the Tempur-Pedic in the backyard

08:41.725 --> 08:43.058
and you can glamp all you want.

08:43.827 --> 08:45.629
-I second that.

08:45.731 --> 08:47.200
Wait,
this is pretty cool.

08:47.302 --> 08:49.097
Last one in sleeps on the floor.

08:49.965 --> 08:51.296
-Whoa!
-Whoa.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.307
Touch me again
and you'll lose a finger.

08:53.409 --> 08:54.673
-Okay.
-Good thing

08:54.775 --> 08:56.070
-I've got nine more.
-Where do I start?

09:00.378 --> 09:02.583
Hey. Hello?

09:04.880 --> 09:06.615
Hey, can you do me a favor?

09:06.884 --> 09:08.421
Start the car
while you grab the kids?

09:08.523 --> 09:11.721
No, um,
I need you to be here with me.

09:11.890 --> 09:13.760
I'm-- I'm literally standing
in front of you.

09:13.928 --> 09:17.027
Okay, I mean,
the texting, the sneaking away

09:17.129 --> 09:20.359
so you can talk to your clients.
I need you to be present.

09:21.329 --> 09:23.064
I mean, the whole reason
that we're doing this

09:23.166 --> 09:25.764
is so that we can have
time together as a family.

09:27.036 --> 09:30.737
Hannah is 16
and... and Henry shot up

09:30.839 --> 09:32.072
like a foot this spring,

09:32.175 --> 09:34.408
and I have no idea
how any of this happened.

09:34.711 --> 09:37.211
Hey, hey, look at me.

09:38.284 --> 09:40.351
I'm here, okay?

09:40.753 --> 09:43.416
Uh, my choice
would have been Maui.

09:44.822 --> 09:47.353
But look at me,
wherever you are,

09:47.921 --> 09:49.223
that's my paradise.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.126
Oh.

09:51.662 --> 09:55.735
I promise, I am 100%...

09:58.271 --> 09:59.337
"Blessed?"

09:59.840 --> 10:04.172
I am so happy
to hear you say that.

10:12.883 --> 10:15.348
-Okay, kiddos, ten hut!

10:18.189 --> 10:20.019
That shoulder blade's
healing nicely, Barb.

10:20.121 --> 10:22.690
Get in here, son,
let me see here.

10:23.025 --> 10:25.491
-Bingo, bango, bongo.

10:25.593 --> 10:29.231
Hear that,
lumbar is popping like a champ.

10:29.333 --> 10:33.801
-Now where's my yummy bride?
-Here I come,<i> Papi.</i>

10:33.903 --> 10:37.511
Oh, honey, the kids.

10:37.613 --> 10:39.111
-How do you think they got here?

10:39.413 --> 10:42.512
-Hmm?
-Oh!

10:42.781 --> 10:45.581
Hi, hello,
yurt family, I'm Grace--

10:45.683 --> 10:47.688
Stop, not another word.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.822
Oh. Oh!

10:50.852 --> 10:54.458
Oh, wow. That is...

10:54.627 --> 10:55.954
Like the way God meant it to be?

10:56.123 --> 10:58.031
-You're welcome.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.093
Hey, you must be
the man of the house.

11:00.195 --> 11:03.099
Tommy, I see you've met...
met my wife.

11:03.201 --> 11:07.835
I have, Eddie Sanders,
<i>mi esposa bonita, </i> Victoria.

11:07.937 --> 11:09.334
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:09.470 --> 11:11.806
-Come on, I'm a hugger.
-Oh, my, hi, oh, wow.

11:11.908 --> 11:13.174
-Ah.

11:13.276 --> 11:15.006
<i>Well, niños </i> are back there.
Say hi, kiddos.

11:15.142 --> 11:17.014
Hi.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.511
-Uh.
-They'll warm up.

11:19.747 --> 11:20.917
Okay.

11:21.186 --> 11:23.783
You are gonna wanna
hot compress this and massage

11:23.885 --> 11:24.953
this a little later.

11:25.055 --> 11:26.725
Might I say,
professionally speaking,

11:26.827 --> 11:28.889
of course, your wife
has a lovely neck...

11:28.991 --> 11:30.489
-Oh.
-...goose-like.

11:30.624 --> 11:33.428
You don't get your hands
on a neck like that every day.

11:34.835 --> 11:36.569
Now, would you look at that
beautiful yurt?

11:36.671 --> 11:37.899
-Oh, yes, yes...
-Oh.

11:38.068 --> 11:39.770
...and at half the price
of the cabins.

11:39.872 --> 11:41.942
Dave Ramsey would
be so proud of us.

11:43.841 --> 11:45.704
-Uh, here's my card.
-Hmm?

11:47.682 --> 11:50.380
"Intergalactic Chiropractic?"

11:50.482 --> 11:52.245
Oh, oh, honey.

11:52.481 --> 11:55.982
My services are free
all week for my camp families.

11:56.084 --> 11:57.250
-Thank you.

11:57.352 --> 11:58.790
Let me grab
these bags for you.

11:58.893 --> 12:00.053
Thank you,
thank you so much, Eddie.

12:00.155 --> 12:01.624
You can call me
Dr. Eddie.

12:01.726 --> 12:02.859
-Right.

12:03.328 --> 12:04.928
Guess I'll get ours
all by myself, then.

12:05.030 --> 12:06.692
-Dear God.
-Thank you, Dr. Eddie.

12:06.828 --> 12:08.329
Please, no.

12:10.232 --> 12:11.669
I know it's there somewhere.

12:11.805 --> 12:13.102
You know,
I can't tell you

12:13.204 --> 12:15.441
how wonderful it is
to have another family here

12:15.710 --> 12:17.539
who loves
the full outdoor experience,

12:17.841 --> 12:18.907
-you know?
-Oh, yeah,

12:19.143 --> 12:21.378
yeah, I mean,
we can't get enough of it.

12:21.514 --> 12:22.715
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:35.630 --> 12:36.793
Um, I feel like
we should maybe--

12:36.895 --> 12:38.496
It's good,
it's good, just let him.

12:46.238 --> 12:48.870
Look at this guy,
he's here ten minutes

12:48.972 --> 12:50.371
and he already needs a shower.

12:53.145 --> 12:55.640
Um, honey, you're gonna
be sleeping over there.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.915
What, why not by you?

12:58.017 --> 13:00.579
Oh, hey, uh,
we separated the yurt by gender.

13:00.681 --> 13:03.521
Yeah, no offense,
but we just met you guys,

13:03.623 --> 13:04.923
so, uh, instead of doing

13:05.025 --> 13:07.423
background checks,
we will just keep things kosher.

13:07.525 --> 13:08.592
Mm...

13:08.961 --> 13:11.458
-Honey, can we talk a second?
-Yeah.

13:12.465 --> 13:13.865
What? No Wi-Fi.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.900
I can't wait
until you realize

13:17.002 --> 13:19.534
-there's no air conditioning.
-What?

13:20.270 --> 13:21.805
I thought you wanted us
to be all together,

13:21.940 --> 13:23.704
-like a family.
-We are together.

13:24.173 --> 13:26.979
Come on,
it's more campy this way.

13:27.845 --> 13:29.313
It smells like old cedar.

13:29.916 --> 13:32.853
It smells like
an old gerbil cage.

13:36.318 --> 13:37.884
-We're changing yurts right now.
-Tommy.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.005
Well, land of Goshen,
that was fun, kids.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.141
Bring it in
for a big spiritual hug.

14:00.243 --> 14:03.111
Hey, uh, how about
we invite you guys

14:03.213 --> 14:05.984
to a little
Sanders family tradition?

14:06.153 --> 14:09.085
Every year, we like to offer up
a humble hymn of praise

14:09.320 --> 14:12.957
to the Lord and consecrate
the yurt as holy ground.

14:13.059 --> 14:15.222
-What do you say?
-You know, we'd love to,

14:15.357 --> 14:17.161
but we're gonna
have to make a change.

14:19.994 --> 14:21.126
I...

14:23.838 --> 14:27.165
Change of key,
I can't sing in A major.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.738
-Perfect pitch, I see.

14:30.007 --> 14:33.111
My friend, that makes two of us.

14:34.046 --> 14:35.440
Honey,
let's wait a while.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.015
We're still getting settled,
you know?

14:37.184 --> 14:39.411
-You mind holding down the alto?
-You got the melody?

14:39.513 --> 14:42.086
Oh, and a one
and a two and a three.

14:42.188 --> 14:46.259
<i>♪ Oh, Lord, my God</i>
<i>When I in awesome... ♪</i>

14:46.361 --> 14:49.061

-Yeah!

15:18.654 --> 15:21.920
-Good yell, buddy, that was fun.
-That was something.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.293
You're welcome.

15:26.628 --> 15:29.497
Ooh, it's all about the sauce,
you want some?

15:30.231 --> 15:32.731
-Uh, no, thanks.
-Oh...

15:33.972 --> 15:35.467
you guys eat really healthy.

15:35.636 --> 15:38.271
Oh, yeah,
we do the WWJE diet

15:38.373 --> 15:39.913
-every year at camp.
-Oh.

15:40.082 --> 15:42.044
It's really easy, you just look
at your food and go,

15:42.213 --> 15:45.045
"Would Jesus really eat this?"

15:45.314 --> 15:47.015
I talked them into
a discount rate

15:47.117 --> 15:48.753
if we promise not to eat meat.

15:48.855 --> 15:50.720
Well, I'll eat yours then, okay?

15:50.955 --> 15:52.256
It's your funeral, bucko.

15:56.991 --> 15:58.429
Okay.

15:59.232 --> 16:02.633
Let's go sit at that table
with our new friends.

16:16.581 --> 16:19.148
Kapoor Capital,
how may I direct your call?

16:19.283 --> 16:21.283
Yeah, hi,
this is, uh, Tommy Ackerman,

16:21.386 --> 16:22.814
-calling for Mr. Kapoor.

16:22.950 --> 16:25.854
Hi, Mr. Ackerman. I'm sorry,
right now he's in a meeting

16:25.956 --> 16:27.192
with Tommy Ackerman.

16:28.128 --> 16:30.222
Uh, that's impossible,
I'm Tommy Ackerman.

16:30.424 --> 16:33.528
No, I'm pretty sure you're not.

16:33.630 --> 16:37.170
Okay, hang on a second.
This Tommy Ackerman, is he, uh,

16:37.272 --> 16:40.970
tall, dark hair, above average
in the handsome department?

16:41.205 --> 16:44.973
No, he's, like,
way above average

16:45.075 --> 16:46.805
in the bald department.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.510
Bramberger.

16:49.811 --> 16:52.214
You always bring your cell phone
to the dinner table?

16:52.316 --> 16:54.318
<i> Hello,</i>
<i>are you there?</i>

16:55.883 --> 16:58.789
-Wait for daddy, okay?
-Henry, Henry, don't eat yet.

16:58.924 --> 17:00.258
But I'm starving.

17:02.224 --> 17:03.524
-Uh...
-Mommy,

17:03.626 --> 17:06.099
-can you cut my carrots?
-Sure, sweetie.

17:06.935 --> 17:08.827
Tommy,
you mind saying blessing for us?

17:09.396 --> 17:13.271
-Tommy,

17:13.373 --> 17:15.204
-Tommy, are you choking?
-All right, doctor ready...

17:15.306 --> 17:16.570
-Tommy, Tommy!
-...to the hizz-ouse.

17:16.705 --> 17:18.843
Here we go, all right,
now stand upward, please.

17:18.945 --> 17:20.009
-This is gonna hurt.

17:20.111 --> 17:22.548
<i>-Uno, dos, tres.</i>

17:22.684 --> 17:23.648
-Uh!
-No, all right,

17:23.750 --> 17:24.881
elbows on the table.

17:24.983 --> 17:26.113
-Here we go.
-Whoa.

17:26.549 --> 17:28.117
Friends, this is why
we have chiropractors.

17:28.253 --> 17:29.316
-Brace for impact...

17:29.418 --> 17:31.557
-...one, two, three!

17:31.725 --> 17:33.022
-Oh!
-Still nada,

17:33.125 --> 17:34.726
-here we go, up we go.

17:34.961 --> 17:37.697
-Chin up, beautiful.

17:37.832 --> 17:39.730
-Full hand.

17:39.866 --> 17:41.701
-Ew.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.263
-Eddie!

17:43.365 --> 17:44.530
-Oh.

17:44.632 --> 17:46.936
Just doing
my good Lord's work.

17:47.138 --> 17:49.938
Thank you, thank you.

17:50.474 --> 17:53.272
I just love
how food brings people together.

17:53.441 --> 17:56.209
Dr. Eddie! Dr. Eddie!

17:56.311 --> 17:58.082
Dr. Eddie, Dr. Eddie!

17:58.218 --> 18:00.382
Honey, you've got to take
smaller bites.

18:00.751 --> 18:04.718
Dr. Eddie,
Dr. Eddie, Dr. Eddie, Dr. Eddie!

18:04.820 --> 18:07.587
-Dr. Eddie, Dr. Eddie!
-It's him, not me, it's him.

18:07.690 --> 18:09.495
-Okay, a little bit me,

18:09.597 --> 18:10.557
but mostly him!

18:10.859 --> 18:12.625
-Dr. Eddie, Dr. Eddie!
-Thank you, thank you.

18:12.727 --> 18:16.895
Dr. Eddie, Dr. Eddie,
Dr. Eddie!

18:32.452 --> 18:34.781
Come on, come on,
pick up, pick up, pick up.

18:36.884 --> 18:39.351
-<i> Tommy Ackerman.</i>
-Bramberger.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.525
Mr. Kapoor says hello,
by the way.

18:42.627 --> 18:44.760
<i> Look, I don't know</i>
<i>what you're scheming,</i>

18:45.096 --> 18:46.424
but Kapoor's my client

18:46.627 --> 18:48.101
and you're gonna
leave him alone.

18:48.203 --> 18:50.264
<i> Ah,</i>
<i>you mean he was your client.</i>

18:50.667 --> 18:52.169
Reception's terrible,
where you at, anyway?

18:52.271 --> 18:53.501
<i>It's none of your business</i>

18:53.604 --> 18:55.302
<i>-where I'm at--</i>
-Where you at? Where you at?

18:55.537 --> 18:57.039
Family Camp,
it's a church thing.

18:57.608 --> 19:01.674
Hang on a second,
did you just say church camp?

19:01.776 --> 19:04.345
All right, don't get
your hopes up, Lucifer.

19:04.681 --> 19:06.819
They don't let in
greedy little Hamburglars

19:06.921 --> 19:08.087
who freeload off their grandma.

19:08.189 --> 19:09.555
<i> Whatever,</i>
<i>Gammy likes it.</i>

19:18.796 --> 19:21.432
Yeah, listen up, I'm gonna have
the Garden City deal wrapped up

19:21.534 --> 19:23.929
with Kapoor long before
you get back, and when I do,

19:24.031 --> 19:25.972
I'm not just gonna have
your commission in my pocket.

19:26.074 --> 19:27.268
-<i> Bramberger.</i>
-I'm gonna have

Sons and daughters
of the most high,

20:29.334 --> 20:33.268
welcome
to the ceremony of light.

20:43.349 --> 20:46.682
Carriers of the light,
come forth.

20:52.390 --> 20:54.591
-Look, there they are.

20:57.429 --> 20:59.127
This feeling
kind of cultish to you?

20:59.229 --> 21:00.762
Stop it.

21:02.201 --> 21:05.305
Carriers, receive your light.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.185
These three torches
represent the Father,

21:19.420 --> 21:23.551
the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
the eternal light

21:23.887 --> 21:27.360
that shines deep within
the followers of Jesus Christ.

21:28.459 --> 21:31.428
Families,
do you know what happens

21:31.630 --> 21:35.896
when you shine that light
deep into the darkness?

21:36.730 --> 21:41.205
The darkness cannot overcome it.

21:47.313 --> 21:50.244
Moms and dads,
I know you get it.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.017
To you, your families
and your marriages

21:53.119 --> 21:54.183
are what's important.

21:54.585 --> 21:57.450
All you kiddos,
the reason you're here

21:58.020 --> 22:00.721
is 'cause your parents
value you more than they do

22:00.856 --> 22:04.497
a week on a cruise ship,
more than anything.

22:04.665 --> 22:05.593
Hmm.

22:06.029 --> 22:09.497
Families, we are gonna
have a ton of fun this week.

22:09.866 --> 22:13.131
Let's listen for what
God may want to say to us.

22:14.469 --> 22:15.837
He wants to lead.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.005
Will you follow him?

22:24.714 --> 22:26.815
All right, kids,
brush and floss.

22:28.088 --> 22:29.088
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir.

22:29.290 --> 22:32.290
Uh, y... you too, kids,
brush and floss.

22:32.426 --> 22:35.589
-Do we even own floss?
-Dad of the year.

22:36.058 --> 22:40.598
Hey, Ackerman, hey, hey.
Saw you admiring this earlier.

22:44.305 --> 22:45.665
-Pretty sure I wasn't.

22:45.767 --> 22:47.504
The Camp Katokwah trophy.

22:47.607 --> 22:50.338
You should see this baby
on my mantel at home.

22:50.540 --> 22:52.377
Had this custom case made for it

22:52.480 --> 22:55.573
after we set three new records
the first year.

22:57.311 --> 22:59.480
Can you believe they used to
let folks just take this home,

22:59.582 --> 23:01.080
just sitting in their laps?

23:02.056 --> 23:05.187
Okay, I'll bite.

23:05.556 --> 23:07.654
What's a family gotta do
to win it?

23:08.023 --> 23:10.628
Oh, they gotta be
in all the family competitions,

23:11.030 --> 23:11.823
gotta compete.

23:12.092 --> 23:14.431
The family that takes home
the most points

23:14.533 --> 23:16.332
at the end of the week
takes the cup

23:16.601 --> 23:20.169
from my cold, dead hands.

23:20.371 --> 23:21.571
It's natural selection

23:21.673 --> 23:22.934
for keeping
the best families coming back

23:23.036 --> 23:24.708
to camp year after year,
if you ask me.

23:24.843 --> 23:27.809
Didn't peg this place
for being evolutionist.

23:27.978 --> 23:31.048
Hey, are you crazy?
You can't mention the "E" word

23:31.150 --> 23:32.316
at a Christian camp.

23:32.518 --> 23:34.017
Do you know
what could happen to you?

23:34.520 --> 23:36.588
Probably
a bunch of monkey business.

23:37.187 --> 23:38.183
Exactly.

23:39.723 --> 23:41.655
<i>The Sanders are fun, right?</i>

23:41.824 --> 23:45.027
I mean,
they're different, but fun.

23:45.196 --> 23:46.862
Okay, um...

23:47.798 --> 23:49.898
since when is your idea
of fun being, um,

23:50.133 --> 23:55.238
stranded on Survivor Island
with a vegan family gospel band?

23:55.407 --> 23:57.604
Come on, they're not that bad.

23:57.973 --> 23:59.644
And I don't even know
that they're vegan.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.412
-Hmm?
-Hmm, I mean,

24:01.747 --> 24:03.549
let's think about it
for a second. We could learn

24:03.651 --> 24:06.712
a thing or two from them
about essential oils and such,

24:07.081 --> 24:09.947
and, who knows,
maybe you spend some time

24:10.049 --> 24:11.354
-with Dr. Eddie...

24:11.456 --> 24:13.351
...and you guys may become BFFs.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.523
No.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.656
-It could happen.
-No, no, okay,

24:16.758 --> 24:18.327
-first of all, okay?
-Hmm.

24:18.529 --> 24:20.032
-Uh, Dr. Eddie...
-Mm-hmm.

24:20.134 --> 24:21.125
...is a chiropractor.

24:21.394 --> 24:23.565
It means he got his doctorate
from a junior college.

24:23.701 --> 24:24.898
That's not true,
you don't know that.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.337
It is true,
it's true, I read it, okay?

24:27.439 --> 24:29.437
-Hmm.
-And second of all,

24:29.840 --> 24:32.978
-listen, I love you.
-Aw.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.809
But if you think
we're gonna be friends

24:34.911 --> 24:37.282
with that guy,
you need your head examined.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.616
-No, you do, oh, you know what?

24:39.718 --> 24:41.947
Hold on, I got a head examiner
right here.

24:42.116 --> 24:43.817
Ma'am, if you could
just please be still.

24:43.919 --> 24:45.357
-Get your toothbrush out of my--
-No,

24:45.459 --> 24:46.653
No, I'm gonna, no,
I'm gonna examine--

24:46.755 --> 24:47.821
Don't touch my hair with it,

24:48.090 --> 24:49.594
-it's disgusting!
-Yeah, I'm a professional.

24:49.696 --> 24:50.991
<i> Did you learn that</i>
<i>in junior college?</i>

24:54.435 --> 24:55.961
And Lord,
thank you for our children.

24:56.063 --> 24:58.368
May their lives
be a sweet fragrance

24:58.470 --> 24:59.636
-unto you, Lord...
-Yes.

24:59.838 --> 25:02.570
...and may the aroma
of their love just waft up

25:02.672 --> 25:04.168
to your throne room, oh, Lord.

25:04.270 --> 25:06.774
Oh, no, they're sacrificing
their children.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.012
Hey, maybe
they're onto something.

25:11.114 --> 25:12.911
There's nothing
like a... like a righteous--

25:13.013 --> 25:14.783
What smells like
corn nuts in here?

25:14.886 --> 25:16.883
-That's my feet.
-You blessed my children

25:16.985 --> 25:18.589
with a smoking hot mother
so they...

25:18.691 --> 25:20.491
Our kids aren't
really sacrificing material.

25:20.593 --> 25:22.828
-Not so much.

25:23.197 --> 25:24.121
-Come on...
-Hmm?

25:24.357 --> 25:25.725
-...show them how it's done.
-Huh, what's done?

25:25.927 --> 25:27.493
Yeah, you're gonna
bless this mess.

25:27.595 --> 25:28.662
-No.
-Yes.

25:28.764 --> 25:29.862
-I don't--
-Yes, you do,

25:29.964 --> 25:33.067
-come on, you're doing it.
-Uh.

25:34.802 --> 25:37.137
Kids, um, come on, uh,

25:37.239 --> 25:39.978
we're gonna... we're gonna say
a blessing around you,

25:40.080 --> 25:41.411
on... on you.

25:41.514 --> 25:45.116
-Why?
-It's tradition.

25:45.552 --> 25:47.053
You're only doing it
'cause you saw

25:47.155 --> 25:48.253
the Sanders doing it.

25:48.355 --> 25:50.086
-No, we're not.
-Come on,

25:50.522 --> 25:51.956
come on, huddle up, let's go.

25:52.391 --> 25:55.225
Come on, come on.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.859
Okay, come on,

25:59.061 --> 26:00.866
-just close your eyes.
-Do what he says.

26:02.402 --> 26:06.969
God, uh, we thank you for...

26:07.869 --> 26:10.973
Jesus, mm-hmm, 'cause he's...

26:12.407 --> 26:15.843
he's great, I mean, you know,
I mean, you know that, right?

26:15.945 --> 26:17.878
-I mean, you're great, too.
-Honey.

26:17.980 --> 26:21.786
-Hmm?
-Bless the kids, bless them.

26:23.719 --> 26:26.055
We, uh, we just wanna, uh,

26:26.791 --> 26:29.321
we want you
to bless our children,

26:29.423 --> 26:32.831
just God bless-- Well,
you bless them, you bless them.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.327
Yeah, this is our son Henry

26:35.462 --> 26:38.236
and...
...this is our daughter Hannah.

26:38.338 --> 26:39.404
-Yeah.
-In case I...

26:39.539 --> 26:40.569
-Hmm?
-...hadn't mentioned that

26:40.671 --> 26:41.803
earlier. I don't think I did.

26:41.939 --> 26:45.010
In Jesus's name
we pray, amen.

26:45.112 --> 26:46.072
Amen.

26:46.241 --> 26:47.944
-I said, amen.
-Go get them, kiddos.

26:48.978 --> 26:51.481
Pretty sure
God knows our names, Dad.

26:51.750 --> 26:54.584
-Well, you can't be too sure.
-Okay.

26:54.853 --> 26:56.986
Get-- We need to get
a good night's rest.

26:58.220 --> 27:00.654
We got some major butt kicking
to do tomorrow.

27:06.260 --> 27:08.195
<i> Next on</i>
<i>Texarkana Bigfoot.</i>

27:11.264 --> 27:12.765
Where's the other footprints?

27:12.867 --> 27:13.934
What other footprints?

27:14.069 --> 27:15.406
Well, there's lots of mud
down here

27:15.508 --> 27:16.740
and we only found the one print.

27:16.843 --> 27:20.777
No... we got ourselves
a one-legged bigfoot.

27:20.879 --> 27:22.479

welcome to bubble ball.

28:09.693 --> 28:10.857
It's a lot like soccer,

28:11.159 --> 28:12.994
but just a little bit
more contact.

28:15.596 --> 28:16.667
Oh,

28:16.802 --> 28:18.600
-that looks a little violent.
-Mm-hmm.

28:18.702 --> 28:19.902
-Make way!
-No?

28:20.004 --> 28:21.999

Now, the winner today

28:36.149 --> 28:37.687
towards the Camp Katokwah cup.

28:37.856 --> 28:39.818
And up next,
the Ackermans

28:39.920 --> 28:41.154
versus the Sanders,

28:41.457 --> 28:46.293
two families now sworn enemies.
Who will draw first blood?

28:47.063 --> 28:48.693
You know
no one can hear you, right?

28:49.029 --> 28:50.330
Just the way I like it.

28:51.571 --> 28:52.870
Line it up, families.

28:53.005 --> 28:55.533
First team to score
three points is the winner.

28:56.774 --> 29:01.906
Sanders, today we are warriors!

29:02.042 --> 29:04.009
Okay, Sanders, let's go.

29:04.412 --> 29:09.949
-Are you ready to bubble?

29:24.701 --> 29:26.767
-Yeah!

29:27.136 --> 29:28.904
Loose ball,
Sanders, loose ball.

29:29.073 --> 29:31.809
I got it, I got it,
I got it. Vic, to you!

29:31.912 --> 29:34.009
Nice pass,<i> Papi.</i>
Here we go, coming through.

29:34.211 --> 29:37.949
-Okay, Victoria.
-No, not my wife!

29:39.018 --> 29:41.315
Sanders coming in hot
for the body block.

29:43.557 --> 29:44.885
What demon invented this game?

29:44.987 --> 29:46.289
She's going, she's going.

29:49.493 --> 29:50.762
Score!

29:50.864 --> 29:53.363
-Victoria Sanders

29:53.465 --> 29:54.498
with the score.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.161
-Unbelievable.

29:57.364 --> 29:59.197
That's my trophy wife! Whoo!

29:59.433 --> 30:01.368
Whoo!
Sanders, Sanders, Sanders!

30:01.503 --> 30:03.301
-Guys, we can win this.
-Sanders, Sanders!

30:03.437 --> 30:05.035
We should probably stop.
We should probably

30:05.137 --> 30:06.205
just stop right now.

30:06.307 --> 30:07.576
-Sanders

30:07.711 --> 30:08.745
take an early lead.

30:08.947 --> 30:09.977
Let's see
if the Ackermans can answer.

30:10.079 --> 30:11.177
Take that, baldy!

30:11.279 --> 30:15.385
-Victoria.

30:15.487 --> 30:16.554
Ooh

30:16.656 --> 30:19.185
-Uh, I hit her.

30:19.287 --> 30:20.690
Henry Ackerman
has the ball.

30:20.993 --> 30:22.955
Oh, we're just gonna call
that a dribble

30:23.057 --> 30:24.188
and hope for the best.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.522
Here comes Barb Sanders.

30:25.625 --> 30:27.629
Get away from me,
Barb!

30:29.197 --> 30:31.198
-Henry, get up!

30:31.367 --> 30:34.599
That boy's got
brilliant survival instincts.

30:34.701 --> 30:38.110
-Come on, Barb, you got it!
-I'm gonna score!

30:39.847 --> 30:41.809
Toasted and posted,
the Sanders score again.

30:42.045 --> 30:43.614
-Dog pile,

30:43.716 --> 30:45.914
my little champions, dog pile.

30:46.483 --> 30:49.854
Come on, Henry. Look,
Barb weighs, like, 60 pounds.

30:50.023 --> 30:51.822
You can't let her
push you around like that.

30:51.924 --> 30:54.927
Why don't you push her around?

30:55.997 --> 31:00.359
Man down, man down!
Game over, Ackerman.

31:00.494 --> 31:02.497
Looks like the Ackermans
have lost a player.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.434
Unfortunately, that means
that there's a forfeit,

31:05.603 --> 31:06.772
Sanders win.

31:07.007 --> 31:08.437
-We are the champions!

31:09.805 --> 31:12.104
What? Come on.

31:12.273 --> 31:14.243
-Sorry.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.592
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey!

31:28.694 --> 31:31.029
Wow, those look great.

31:31.131 --> 31:34.398
I know, it's kind of cheesy,
but I love it so much.

31:36.902 --> 31:39.499
Are you painting
with mayonnaise?

31:42.842 --> 31:44.708
Hey, guys,
let's go wash up, okay?

31:44.977 --> 31:46.377
Daddy's about done
with his prayer walk

31:46.479 --> 31:47.509
in the woods.

31:47.978 --> 31:50.043
You guys, first year at camp.

31:50.412 --> 31:52.351
You get to do the craft
for new families.

31:52.486 --> 31:54.382
Hold on.

31:55.450 --> 31:58.653
Okay, you're gonna love it.
Here we go.

31:59.356 --> 32:02.286
Okay, so first, what you do
is you count down

32:02.388 --> 32:03.520
the number of days until Henry

32:03.622 --> 32:05.463
and Hannah graduate
from high school.

32:05.665 --> 32:07.157
-Okay.
-Then, together,

32:07.560 --> 32:09.562
count the same number
of beads...

32:10.396 --> 32:11.734
and you put them in the jar.

32:12.103 --> 32:15.833
Then, every day,
you just take one out.

32:16.269 --> 32:18.870
Every day, take one out.

32:19.606 --> 32:23.708
You know,
just every day, take one out...

32:25.685 --> 32:27.217
'cause the days, you know.

32:29.183 --> 32:30.349
Such a great reminder

32:30.451 --> 32:32.486
of how precious
your time is together.

32:33.587 --> 32:37.458
Is this some sort of cruel joke?

32:37.992 --> 32:39.526
-Grace.
-No?

32:39.992 --> 32:41.363
No,

32:41.532 --> 32:43.464
you know, you only have, what?
Two years left with them?

32:44.100 --> 32:47.801
This vase, these beads,

32:48.303 --> 32:50.009
they're gonna make
everyday count.

32:51.973 --> 32:53.243
Do the beads.

32:54.041 --> 32:55.311
There you go.

32:58.112 --> 32:59.349
-Okay.
-Okay.

32:59.684 --> 33:00.716
There you go.

33:00.818 --> 33:02.054
Thank you.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.024
-Come on, let's go.

33:06.191 --> 33:08.255
Hey, bud,
what happened out there today?

33:08.424 --> 33:10.392
I mean, I really thought
we had a good chance

33:10.494 --> 33:13.158
-to win bubble ball.
-Meh, I just don't like sports.

33:13.694 --> 33:17.195
I... I know, but if
you put forth some effort,

33:17.531 --> 33:19.832
uh, you might find
a sport you like.

33:20.001 --> 33:21.270
Like what, golf?

33:21.572 --> 33:23.571
Yeah, maybe you and I could
go out sometime to the course?

33:23.873 --> 33:25.041
-No.
-Okay.

33:25.143 --> 33:26.507
Can you get me
a snow cone?

33:26.809 --> 33:27.808
Yeah.

33:33.119 --> 33:35.248
Here,
in the Amazon rainforest,

33:35.417 --> 33:38.787
it's home to a number
of species,

33:38.923 --> 33:42.156
such as snakes, tigers,

33:42.392 --> 33:45.361
and what I'm gonna soon find,
bigfoots.

33:46.832 --> 33:47.965
What do we have here?

33:48.134 --> 33:49.297
-It's okay.
-It just makes me sad

33:49.399 --> 33:50.868
that my parents immigrated
all the way here

33:50.970 --> 33:52.035
-just to have our--
-Oh, yes,

33:52.137 --> 33:53.367
let's bring
your parents into this.

33:53.470 --> 33:55.540
Nothing more fun
than fighting with four people.

33:55.808 --> 33:57.008
What are you doing?

33:57.277 --> 34:00.371
Nothing, I'm just trying
to catch a bigfoot on camera.

34:00.506 --> 34:02.541
Don't be a dummy, our dad said

34:02.644 --> 34:05.045
that Noah wouldn't let bigfoots
get on the ark

34:05.247 --> 34:07.414
because they smelled like feet.

34:07.683 --> 34:11.055
Yeah, dummy, why else
do you think there's no bigfoot

34:11.157 --> 34:14.324
in any of Noah's Ark's
coloring books, huh?

34:15.160 --> 34:17.922
Touché,
clearly I'm the real dummy.

34:18.091 --> 34:19.227
Mm-hmm.

34:19.530 --> 34:20.995
What does--
what does that look even mean?

34:21.097 --> 34:22.128
Why does it always...

34:36.878 --> 34:39.312
Getting pretty close
to the flame there, bucko,

34:39.414 --> 34:41.183
unless you prefer
charred mellows.

34:41.285 --> 34:42.787
You know,
I wasn't gonna say anything,

34:42.889 --> 34:44.615
but, uh, I'm pretty sure s'mores

34:44.717 --> 34:46.857
aren't on the What Would
Jesus Eat diet.

34:46.959 --> 34:49.556
Hey, we're not monsters, okay?

34:49.758 --> 34:52.759
This is a very important
camp experience for our kids.

34:53.628 --> 34:55.932
Even though we do make
sugar-free, organic,

34:56.034 --> 34:57.598
vegan, non-dairy marshmallows.

34:57.700 --> 35:01.272
Oh, I'd expect nothing
but perfection from you, Eddie.

35:01.374 --> 35:05.039
Whoa, somebody
call the fire department,

35:05.141 --> 35:07.443
look at that.

35:25.966 --> 35:27.193
Hey, Dad, will you film me
tearing

35:27.295 --> 35:28.459
this big ol' s'more down?

35:28.561 --> 35:29.960
Uh, yeah, buddy, let's do that.

35:30.062 --> 35:32.030
Let's go right over here,
way over here by the boats.

35:32.199 --> 35:33.832
Ooh! Mm-mm.

35:35.138 --> 35:36.869
Okay, uh, let me see.

35:37.438 --> 35:39.070
All right, how does this work?

35:44.411 --> 35:46.251
Hmm. Bon appétit, kiddos.

35:51.924 --> 35:52.920
-Okay.

35:53.022 --> 35:54.155
Okay, here I go!

35:54.257 --> 35:55.388
<i> It just makes me sad</i>

35:55.490 --> 35:56.688
<i>-that my parents immigrated...</i>
-Nope.

35:56.790 --> 35:58.128
<i>-...all way here.</i>
-<i> Oh, yeah,</i>

35:58.230 --> 35:59.494
<i>let's bring your parents</i>
<i>into this.</i>

35:59.596 --> 36:01.629
<i>Nothing more fun</i>
<i>than fighting with four people.</i>

36:05.732 --> 36:08.565
Oh, uh, hey, bud,
let's... let's, uh,

36:08.667 --> 36:10.134
let's do... do it again, okay?

36:12.310 --> 36:13.605
No, I know,
I know, I just-- I think

36:13.707 --> 36:15.146
-you got a better one in you.

36:15.282 --> 36:17.381
Why is nothing I do
ever good enough for you?

36:17.583 --> 36:20.516
No, no, let's just... let's just
give it another shot, okay?

36:23.524 --> 36:24.520
Henry!

36:28.259 --> 36:31.758
-Hmm, hmm.

36:41.040 --> 36:42.373
You know, I still can't believe

36:42.508 --> 36:44.568
that the prettiest girl
at camp has never been kissed.

36:44.904 --> 36:47.576
Well, what,
why is that so hard to believe?

36:47.678 --> 36:51.448
I mean, it's cool, I'm sure
you'll find the right guy.

36:56.185 --> 36:58.653
Um, okay.

37:00.322 --> 37:01.791
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:02.093 --> 37:05.991
-Tommy Ackerman.

37:08.728 --> 37:12.101
Did you know
you are the only one

37:12.470 --> 37:14.571
who hasn't signed up
for the Daddy Day Hike?

37:14.940 --> 37:17.639
Oh, you should go.

37:19.408 --> 37:21.674
I would, but, uh, you know what?

37:22.076 --> 37:24.574
The, uh, only reason I came
to camp was just to get to spend

37:24.676 --> 37:25.876
more time with my family.

37:25.978 --> 37:27.611
Well, that's exactly
why you need to do it.

37:27.947 --> 37:30.052
See, all the dads hike up
to Mount Burrow.

37:30.287 --> 37:31.684
They gather by themselves and...

37:31.786 --> 37:34.788
-...listen to God.

37:38.897 --> 37:39.823
Sign him up.

37:39.959 --> 37:41.826
Excellent!
It's the best thing

37:41.928 --> 37:43.669
you're gonna do
for your family all week.

37:44.305 --> 37:47.605
You're awesome.
All right, Johnsons?

37:48.041 --> 37:49.240
Hey, what's up?

37:49.342 --> 37:50.768
I really don't know
about that guy.

37:51.103 --> 37:54.842
I know, I think he spent
way too much time at camp.

37:55.444 --> 37:58.179
What? Oh, no, no, no, not him.

37:58.514 --> 38:00.246
I mean,
Justin Bieber over there.

38:00.549 --> 38:01.981
-That?
-Yeah.

38:02.083 --> 38:04.785
That's just a camp fling.
She'll be over him in a week.

38:07.954 --> 38:09.688
You know, maybe
you should go on this hike,

38:09.790 --> 38:11.594
spend a little more time
with Eddie.

38:12.798 --> 38:14.061
What?

38:14.530 --> 38:17.000
He just puts a lot
into his family,

38:17.135 --> 38:18.469
-and--
-Oh, come on.

38:18.571 --> 38:21.901
You minimize things,
you know, "Oh, she'll be fine."

38:22.603 --> 38:23.735
You're gonna do this, right?

38:23.837 --> 38:26.043
This... this is why
I came over here,

38:26.446 --> 38:28.973
so that you could compare me
to Eddie Sanders?

38:29.075 --> 38:31.048
Oh, yeah, he's just...
he's just the perfect man.

38:31.183 --> 38:32.312
He's a much better dad than me,

38:32.414 --> 38:33.443
-he's--
-No, no, Tommy,

38:33.545 --> 38:34.947
no, I'm sorry...

38:36.053 --> 38:37.081
I'm sorry.

38:38.589 --> 38:40.821
Honey, that was just
an awful thing to say.

38:42.556 --> 38:44.660
It's fine, it's fine.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.596
I don't think
everything's so perfect

38:51.698 --> 38:53.570
in the Sanders camp, anyway.

39:00.807 --> 39:03.014
Families,
welcome to day two

39:03.116 --> 39:04.580
of the Camp Katokwah Challenge.

39:04.816 --> 39:08.248

let me take this one?

40:08.845 --> 40:10.610
I didn't hire
a private archery coach

40:10.712 --> 40:12.081
just to let you take this
from me.

40:13.653 --> 40:16.413
Honey, it's your weakest event,
you said so yourself.

40:17.049 --> 40:18.821
You always pull the shot
to the left.

40:18.923 --> 40:22.923
Not another word, I got this.
This is my year, I can feel it.

40:30.700 --> 40:32.529
Maiden voyage

40:32.931 --> 40:34.235
She's gonna give you nightmares.

40:34.404 --> 40:35.903
All right, easy, Rambo.

40:37.302 --> 40:40.075

42:33.821 --> 42:38.395
Who's your daddy? Yes!

42:38.931 --> 42:41.431
All right, everyone,
looks like now we're tied at 15.

42:41.833 --> 42:44.431
The highest scoring arrow
is gonna win the game.

42:46.936 --> 42:48.904
Let me know
if you're gonna choke again.

42:51.103 --> 42:52.605
Come on, Tommy,
you've got this.

42:52.707 --> 42:54.008
You got this, Dad.

42:58.449 --> 42:59.578
-Four points.
-Yes!

43:05.152 --> 43:06.856
Let's see
what you're made of, Sanders.

43:17.336 --> 43:18.503
-Oh.

43:18.638 --> 43:21.405
Zero points,
Ackerman family takes archery.

43:21.507 --> 43:25.336
-Yeah!
-No, no! this isn't right!

43:25.705 --> 43:28.306
No! No! No!

43:29.479 --> 43:31.546
Yes, in your face!

43:31.715 --> 43:34.081
My stroke was off,
that's not fair.

43:34.713 --> 43:36.116
Eddie!

43:37.354 --> 43:38.822
<i> No!</i>

43:42.756 --> 43:43.888
-Hey, babe.
-Oh!

43:43.990 --> 43:45.826
-Ow!
-Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

43:45.928 --> 43:48.261
-Where'd you get binoculars?

43:48.430 --> 43:49.426
What?

43:51.268 --> 43:52.363
Uh-oh.

43:54.206 --> 43:55.201
You okay?

43:55.669 --> 43:56.669
Yeah, why?

43:57.071 --> 43:58.870
Nothing,
you're just kind of murdering

43:58.972 --> 44:00.274
that ice cream cone, is all.

44:00.610 --> 44:02.078
I'm stress eating, okay?

44:02.714 --> 44:03.842
This is supposed to be
Family Camp,

44:03.944 --> 44:05.277
not Find-Dumb-Boyfriend Camp.

44:06.511 --> 44:09.281
You know, last year,
we would share an ice cream

44:09.383 --> 44:11.354
and we would be talking
about our favorite flavors,

44:11.456 --> 44:13.252
oh, but this year, nuh-uh.

44:14.427 --> 44:15.658
Instead, she's with some guy

44:15.760 --> 44:17.558
whose intentions
are God only knows what,

44:18.127 --> 44:20.228
and I'm stuck here
with a vase full of beads...

44:21.165 --> 44:23.160
counting all the days that
she should be spending with us,

44:23.262 --> 44:25.330
but is instead
spending with him, oh.

44:27.434 --> 44:33.877
-Brain freeze.
-Hey, hey, come here, come here.

44:34.475 --> 44:35.546
Oh!

44:35.681 --> 44:37.881
-What's that?

44:39.019 --> 44:40.016
Nothing.

44:40.818 --> 44:43.284
Nothing is buzzing
in your back pocket.

44:43.787 --> 44:46.456
-Okay.
-Look, don't answer it.

44:46.658 --> 44:47.822
It's... it's about
the promotion.

44:47.924 --> 44:49.794
-Just don't answer it.
-Two seconds...

44:50.462 --> 44:52.630
two, I promise. Hello?

44:52.733 --> 44:54.799
-Tommy, quick update,

44:55.034 --> 44:58.701
just had the most delicious
club sandwich with Mr. Kapoor.

44:58.836 --> 45:00.770
Well, I'm sorry
you didn't choke on it.

45:00.872 --> 45:02.507
<i> Geez Louise,</i>
<i>Mr. Kapoor,</i>

45:02.642 --> 45:04.739
you are cruising this path
like a pro.

45:05.108 --> 45:09.408
Whoa, whoa,
easy there, Danica Patrick.

45:09.510 --> 45:12.113
Hey, look, I'll text you later
when I seal the--

45:12.647 --> 45:14.080
Steal the deal.

45:14.449 --> 45:17.188
You get out of that golf cart
right now, do you hear me?

45:17.357 --> 45:18.786
Bramberger, Bramberger!

45:22.626 --> 45:24.659
Grace. Grace, hold up.

45:24.862 --> 45:27.895
No, no,
I will not hold up.

45:27.997 --> 45:30.230
I have held up
for the past five years.

45:31.666 --> 45:32.870
I'm sorry.

45:34.668 --> 45:35.873
Listen.

45:37.773 --> 45:39.570
When we get home, I...

45:40.506 --> 45:43.914
I think that we should
go to marriage counseling.

45:45.443 --> 45:48.545
Oh, come on,
we don't need counseling.

45:52.558 --> 45:53.924
I knew that's what you'd say.

45:54.723 --> 45:57.026
I mean, I knew it.

45:59.358 --> 46:01.225
-Grace.

46:01.327 --> 46:03.835
-Heads up, watch out!

46:06.766 --> 46:08.070
Um...

46:08.738 --> 46:10.105
Girl's got a good arm.

46:11.570 --> 46:15.076
This was clearly
a terrible idea.

46:15.178 --> 46:17.314
<i> You have</i>
<i>reached the voicemail box of...</i>

46:17.416 --> 46:18.850
<i> Alex Kapoor.</i>

46:19.549 --> 46:20.544
Dad?

46:21.279 --> 46:22.753
I'm scared, I want to come down.

46:22.856 --> 46:24.982
Buddy, that's what
the repelling gear is for.

46:25.084 --> 46:26.351
You're not gonna fall.

46:26.453 --> 46:28.987
N... No, I... I don't want
to do this anymore.

46:29.423 --> 46:32.227
I'm freaking out up here
and you don't even care.

46:32.463 --> 46:33.557
No.

46:34.327 --> 46:35.896
Need a little slack
in your line?

46:36.032 --> 46:38.199
Oh,
more than you know.

46:39.368 --> 46:42.335
Hey, buddy, mind if I holler
at your dad for a minute?

46:43.136 --> 46:45.371
Yeah, thanks, I'm coming down.

46:48.314 --> 46:50.178
Oh, thank God.

46:50.881 --> 46:53.412
-He's a good kid.
-Yeah, yeah.

46:55.147 --> 46:56.515
Remind me your name again.

46:57.218 --> 47:00.320
-Tommy, we go to your church.
-Yes.

47:01.486 --> 47:04.993
-Golfer, right?
-Uh, yeah, yeah, sorry.

47:05.095 --> 47:06.893
I think I've been showing up
a little late.

47:07.162 --> 47:08.593
No, it's all good.
Seeing you come in

47:08.695 --> 47:10.831
reminds me I only have a minute
or two left in the sermon.

47:10.933 --> 47:15.039
Well, I deserve that.

47:15.909 --> 47:18.642
-Hey, can I be honest with you?
-Sure.

47:18.811 --> 47:22.577
Yeah, um, I think God
and I are good.

47:23.046 --> 47:25.510
He and I are okay.
Uh, it's just, uh...

47:26.686 --> 47:28.783
I'm busy,
there's a lot going on,

47:29.019 --> 47:31.420
and, uh,
church is just another thing

47:31.522 --> 47:32.484
on my list.

47:33.152 --> 47:36.191
Hmm. No judgements here.

47:37.293 --> 47:39.759
See, it doesn't matter
if you're... if you're old

47:39.861 --> 47:40.927
or if you're young.

47:41.463 --> 47:44.465
We are all in different spots
in our journey with God.

47:44.901 --> 47:47.334
-Yeah.
-Hey, Tommy, you...

47:48.707 --> 47:49.935
you know what a compass does?

47:50.270 --> 47:51.909
It tells you where to go?

47:52.178 --> 47:55.640
Not exactly, it turns out
it only has one basic function.

47:56.376 --> 47:58.548
A compass points you
to true north,

47:59.151 --> 48:02.251
and once you got true north,
you can never get lost.

48:03.054 --> 48:06.958
Since we're being honest,
I'm your pastor.

48:07.960 --> 48:10.457
But it's not my job
or the church's job

48:10.893 --> 48:12.326
to lead your family...

48:13.498 --> 48:14.493
it's yours.

48:15.761 --> 48:19.603
See, life can pull you
in many different directions

48:19.705 --> 48:21.999
if you let it, but real talk...

48:23.638 --> 48:27.143
...it's pretty easy to get lost
if you don't have a guide.

48:30.914 --> 48:33.116
-Have fun out here.
-Yeah.

48:42.991 --> 48:44.291
<i> Sanders family,</i>

48:44.393 --> 48:46.360
<i>I am proud of you</i>
<i>and all the hustle today.</i>

48:46.462 --> 48:49.460
<i>We destroyed so many families</i>
<i>on the field of battle,</i>

48:49.562 --> 48:52.233
<i>including the Ackermans</i>
<i>in most events.</i>

48:52.335 --> 48:54.966
<i>I know the good Lord</i>
<i>is so pleased with us.</i>

48:56.468 --> 48:57.970
-<i> Eddie?</i>
-<i> Mm-hmm?</i>

48:58.072 --> 48:59.472
<i> We can hear you.</i>

49:01.641 --> 49:04.782
<i> Oh, no,</i>
<i>Little Billy Graham is gone.</i>

49:04.884 --> 49:06.380
<i>Who's Little Billy Graham?</i>

49:06.482 --> 49:09.717
<i> Nobody panic,</i>
<i>he's just the smaller gerbil.</i>

49:09.819 --> 49:10.784
<i> What?</i>

49:14.055 --> 49:15.385
<i> Gentlemen, welcome</i>

49:15.487 --> 49:17.287
<i>to the Ouachita</i>
<i>National Forest,</i>

49:17.389 --> 49:19.094
<i>One-point-eight million acres</i>

49:19.196 --> 49:21.833
<i>across two states.</i>
<i>So in light of that,</i>

49:21.935 --> 49:24.330
today we are gonna do
the buddy system.

49:24.632 --> 49:26.737
That means no one goes
anywhere without their buddy.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.032
-Mm-hmm
-So go ahead and pair up.

49:32.539 --> 49:34.775
Now, Eddie Sanders
has volunteered

49:34.877 --> 49:36.011
to be the caboose

49:36.247 --> 49:37.777
so that we can keep
the entire group together.

49:38.179 --> 49:39.950
Eddie, who's your lucky buddy?

49:40.085 --> 49:42.447
That would be my yurt made,
Tommy Ackerman.

49:42.550 --> 49:45.487
Oh, no, sorry,
Pastor Dave and I were, um...

49:46.090 --> 49:49.093
-Not on the same page

49:50.762 --> 49:51.788
All right, let's head out.

49:54.601 --> 49:55.797
Let's go, bucko.

49:56.233 --> 49:58.462
Yeah, did you pack enough
for a day hike?

49:58.764 --> 50:00.401
Well, it's a little light
for an Eagle Scout,

50:00.503 --> 50:02.903
but if we get lost,
the good Lord always provides.

50:03.005 --> 50:04.936
Am I right? I'm right.

50:39.143 --> 50:41.812
I have an offer for you,
free of charge.

50:42.114 --> 50:43.978
I know it's gonna sound
too good to be true,

50:44.080 --> 50:45.611
but I can't help it, I like you.

50:45.713 --> 50:48.452
It's starting to smell
like a pyramid scheme.

50:48.554 --> 50:49.514
Oh, heavens no.

50:49.683 --> 50:51.652
The essential oils
are my wife's department.

50:52.288 --> 50:54.057
Nay, nay, nay,
what the good Lord laid

50:54.160 --> 50:58.393
upon my heart is for you
to have some mentorship

50:59.094 --> 51:01.860
in parenting with me.

51:02.697 --> 51:04.801
It'll be the best
five years of your life.

51:05.137 --> 51:06.703
People don't call me
the mentoring Miyagi

51:06.805 --> 51:07.905
-for nothing.
-Mm-hmm.

51:08.007 --> 51:10.041
Name one person
who calls you Miyagi.

51:10.143 --> 51:12.473
Alto, you stay right here
and think about it.

51:12.575 --> 51:14.673
I'm gonna hop off the trail
to the little boy's room.

51:15.581 --> 51:16.842
Okay, hey.

51:17.512 --> 51:19.549
Hurry up,
I don't want to get left behind.

51:20.219 --> 51:22.587
Ah, I don't want
to get bit by any bugs.

51:22.689 --> 51:24.584
Oops, that's poison ivy.

51:25.989 --> 51:28.753
Come on, come on.

51:40.707 --> 51:44.208
-Aha.

51:44.909 --> 51:46.677
Sweet manna from heaven.

51:49.578 --> 51:53.613
Daddy's bringing home
the honey.

52:02.222 --> 52:06.023
Run, run!

52:07.564 --> 52:10.666
-Get that thing away from me!
-My skin is on fire!

52:11.369 --> 52:14.164
-Get away from me!
-It's free!

52:14.500 --> 52:15.532
-Get rid of it!

52:15.634 --> 52:19.672
It's free organic honey!

52:22.477 --> 52:25.447
-That's a co-pay.

52:37.292 --> 52:40.792
Man, my face stings so bad.

52:42.768 --> 52:44.202
Do you see anything?

52:45.135 --> 52:47.434
No, no, I don't, mm-mm, no.

52:47.536 --> 52:49.205
You look... you look good.
You look good.

52:49.374 --> 52:52.940
Oh, praise God, I prayed
for a hedge of protection

52:53.576 --> 52:57.677
and the good Lord
always comes through every time.

52:57.813 --> 53:02.485
Um, yeah, if you stop breathing,
just say something, okay?

53:02.587 --> 53:05.055
-Ten-four.
-Okay, great, great, great.

53:05.157 --> 53:07.486
-Hey, um, that, uh...

53:07.588 --> 53:09.291
...that fort back there,
I was thinking--

53:14.866 --> 53:17.268
Eddie! Eddie, Eddie?

53:17.370 --> 53:20.203
Quick, give me a shot
of epinephrine in my pouch.

53:20.439 --> 53:22.672
Geez, how much stuff
you got-- Oh, found it.

53:22.807 --> 53:23.937
Okay, hold on...

53:24.072 --> 53:25.408
Okay, now what?

53:25.510 --> 53:28.110
Before you stab me,
you need to massage my thigh.

53:28.245 --> 53:31.480
-Um, nope.
-Do you want me to die?

53:31.882 --> 53:32.808
Hmm, well--

53:32.910 --> 53:34.516
You have to massage my leg
in the spot

53:34.618 --> 53:36.449
where you're gonna stab me
in for at least ten seconds

53:36.584 --> 53:39.054
-or it does not work.
-Okay.

53:43.424 --> 53:45.358
Oh, oh, that feels kind of nice.

53:45.594 --> 53:47.526
-Please stop talking.

53:47.695 --> 53:49.498
Okay, uh, you might want to,
I don't know,

53:49.633 --> 53:51.427
-say a prayer or something.
-Okay, all right,

53:51.562 --> 53:52.831
let me grab my keys.

53:59.739 --> 54:01.906
-My hand!
-You put in there!

54:04.246 --> 54:05.513
-Do it again.
-Again?

54:05.648 --> 54:08.015
You have to stab me
in the legs or the buttocks

54:08.117 --> 54:09.379
or it does not work.

54:10.015 --> 54:12.552
The legs it is,
let me dust this off real quick.

54:12.654 --> 54:14.418
No, no, no,
I have a second pen in here.

54:14.620 --> 54:16.393
-Of course you do.

54:17.329 --> 54:19.325
-Oh, hey.
-Okay, okay.

54:19.560 --> 54:21.293
-I'm starting to see Heaven.
-No.

54:21.628 --> 54:23.801
Hey, hey,
Uncle Roy, is that you?

54:24.103 --> 54:25.694
Do you still make
those flapjacks?

54:25.863 --> 54:27.964
I want some flapjacks,
Uncle Roy.

54:28.099 --> 54:30.371
-No, tell Roy to go away.
-Make it big flapjacks,

54:30.473 --> 54:31.974
-Uncle Roy.
-No, no, don't take those.

54:32.110 --> 54:33.537
Melt that butter, Uncle Roy.

54:33.672 --> 54:35.409
Don't. You tell Roy to get away.

54:35.511 --> 54:38.679
Roy, get away!
The kitchen's closed.

54:48.055 --> 54:49.052
Hmm.

54:50.192 --> 54:52.025
-Huh?

54:52.628 --> 54:55.232
-Wow, that thing works fast.

54:55.334 --> 54:57.694
Yeah, that is pure adrenalin,
my friend.

54:58.230 --> 55:00.431
-Hey, I want to go for a run.

55:00.533 --> 55:01.733
You want to go for a run?

55:01.835 --> 55:03.534
I want to go for one,
let's go for a run!

55:03.637 --> 55:04.906
Okay, hot pants,
why don't you...

55:05.008 --> 55:06.410
Come on!

55:14.519 --> 55:16.552
Uh, finally,
some mother daughter time--

55:16.688 --> 55:19.649
-Okay, okay, careful, Mom.
-Ooh, that is slippery.

55:20.018 --> 55:22.421
All right, okay,
Mom, okay, Mom.

55:22.523 --> 55:23.521
Just whatever you do,

55:23.624 --> 55:24.688
-don't let go.
-Okay.

55:24.823 --> 55:26.562
-Hey, there.
-Oh, hey.

55:28.931 --> 55:32.766
-Want to toss the 'bee around?
-Yeah, sure. Um, hey, Mom?

55:33.672 --> 55:34.669
Mom?

55:36.706 --> 55:39.707
Oh, okay, is it cool
if I go hang with Corbin?

55:42.807 --> 55:44.410
-Thanks.
-After you.

55:44.512 --> 55:47.215
Thank you, so how have you been?

55:47.317 --> 55:48.878
Uh, yeah, pretty good.

55:48.980 --> 55:53.490
Come on,
come on, God.

55:54.827 --> 55:55.954
I'm good.

56:05.597 --> 56:06.800
-Hey.
-Hmm?

56:08.505 --> 56:10.139
-Were you tickling my face?

56:10.508 --> 56:12.869
Yeah, I was,
I tried shaking you violently,

56:12.971 --> 56:15.743
but all that did
was make me feel good.

56:19.150 --> 56:20.709
That's the way.

56:23.848 --> 56:26.589
That is not a trail.

56:34.061 --> 56:36.567
The trail winds
to the left up there quite a bit

56:37.036 --> 56:38.499
and I'm 100% positive

56:38.601 --> 56:40.029
that if we cut through
these woods,

56:40.131 --> 56:42.500
we will find ourselves
back on the trail

56:42.735 --> 56:45.036
and probably ahead of the group.

56:51.711 --> 56:54.513
Hey, buddy, come on.

56:54.815 --> 56:57.087
This is our story
to tell our wives,

56:57.189 --> 56:58.552
how we braved the wilderness

56:58.654 --> 57:01.921
and fought our way back home.

57:09.131 --> 57:10.127
Come on.

57:12.631 --> 57:14.604
Come on.

57:16.337 --> 57:17.369
Come, come.

57:17.905 --> 57:20.772
Okay, but quit talking to me
like I'm a dog.

57:20.874 --> 57:22.542
-Good boy, Tommy.
-Stop it.

57:22.978 --> 57:28.519
Eight, ten, twelve, fourteen,
sixteen, eighteen...

57:30.585 --> 57:32.017
Has anyone seen Tommy or Eddie?

57:32.853 --> 57:37.088
-Tommy, Eddie?

57:42.164 --> 57:43.162
Oh, no.

57:51.269 --> 57:53.208
I should have known better
than to trust you.

57:53.410 --> 57:55.178
You have no idea where we are.

57:55.280 --> 57:56.511
Well, good luck crossing that.

57:56.613 --> 57:58.341
I've crossed it
a dozen times.

57:58.876 --> 58:01.244
That, you've crossed that?

58:05.353 --> 58:06.557
Things like it.

58:12.563 --> 58:15.933
Mentorship tip
numero uno,

58:16.369 --> 58:17.796
never ask your kids
to do something

58:17.898 --> 58:20.195
that you aren't willing
to do yourself.

58:20.398 --> 58:23.571
In this illustration,
I will play the brave father

58:23.673 --> 58:25.101
that has already conquered
the river,

58:25.203 --> 58:27.441
and you will play
the scared little boy.

58:27.576 --> 58:28.873
Just picture yourself as Henry.

58:29.109 --> 58:31.040
Yeah, please don't talk
about my son.

58:31.176 --> 58:33.144
Your son,
he's the quiet, reclusive type.

58:33.246 --> 58:36.584
If I've seen it once,
I've seen it 100,000 times.

58:36.686 --> 58:38.616
If you do not
get a handle on this,

58:38.985 --> 58:40.591
you're gonna have
a hoarder for a son.

58:40.759 --> 58:42.986
Hey, Eddie, shut your mouth
before I shut it for you.

58:43.088 --> 58:45.362
Today,
he is a quiet little bookworm.

58:45.497 --> 58:47.859
Tomorrow,
he is stuck in an apartment

58:47.961 --> 58:49.392
with a bunch of junk
that he bought

58:49.494 --> 58:52.168
at a home shopping channel
with your credit card, bucko.

58:52.270 --> 58:53.604
-Hey, Eddie.
-Yeah?

58:55.403 --> 58:56.404
No, no!

58:56.707 --> 58:59.207
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58:59.309 --> 59:01.471
My glasses.

59:04.008 --> 59:06.650
No, not my mustache!

59:17.925 --> 59:21.458
-I am a chiropractor!

59:26.231 --> 59:28.034
-You're so dead.
-You don't know me.

59:28.136 --> 59:32.575
No, who consecrates
a yurt with a harmonica song?

59:32.677 --> 59:36.876
I do, I do with pleasure,
with pleasure.

59:36.978 --> 59:39.683
Well, it's not pleasurable
to anyone else!

59:39.785 --> 59:43.885
You don't know anything!
Anything, anything, anything!

59:55.000 --> 59:55.996
Uh...

59:59.666 --> 1:00:01.067
Mind if I join you?

1:00:05.109 --> 1:00:06.105
Sure.

1:00:08.009 --> 1:00:10.544
Do you want to
talk about it,

1:00:10.646 --> 1:00:12.914
-or--
-No, no, I don't.

1:00:13.283 --> 1:00:14.652
Okay.

1:00:15.618 --> 1:00:17.014
I mean, no offense, but, like,

1:00:17.183 --> 1:00:19.786
your marriage
is just a little too perfect

1:00:20.122 --> 1:00:23.021
for me to, you know,
talk to you about my marriage.

1:00:23.123 --> 1:00:25.192
So I'm just,
I'm not even gonna go there.

1:00:26.290 --> 1:00:29.399
You know, like,
here's the thing, okay?

1:00:29.501 --> 1:00:31.799
I thought
that we would come here

1:00:31.935 --> 1:00:35.130
and that my family
would just magically become

1:00:35.232 --> 1:00:36.635
the family
that I've always wanted

1:00:36.737 --> 1:00:39.006
them to be.

1:00:40.042 --> 1:00:42.244
Whatever you think about me
and my family, uh,

1:00:42.813 --> 1:00:44.174
you know, things get
a lot more complicated

1:00:44.276 --> 1:00:45.908
when you get a peek
behind the curtain, so.

1:00:46.010 --> 1:00:48.715
Oh, please,

1:00:48.984 --> 1:00:51.014
you're like
the perfect Christian family.

1:00:51.450 --> 1:00:54.857
You even eat like Jesus
would eat, for crying out loud.

1:00:57.627 --> 1:00:59.092
We're kind of falling apart.

1:01:00.124 --> 1:01:02.260
Ooh, I just said that out loud.

1:01:03.829 --> 1:01:05.098
We're falling apart.

1:01:08.974 --> 1:01:09.971
Uh.

1:01:10.769 --> 1:01:12.105
Okay, um...

1:01:14.475 --> 1:01:15.471
go on.

1:01:16.714 --> 1:01:18.644
I'm really good
at keeping our secret

1:01:19.247 --> 1:01:21.981
and I put a smile on at church
and I pray and I pray

1:01:22.117 --> 1:01:25.750
and I pray, Grace, I pray,
and I have no voice.

1:01:25.985 --> 1:01:27.184
I have no voice in my marriage,

1:01:27.286 --> 1:01:28.987
and Eddie controls everything,
everything.

1:01:29.089 --> 1:01:30.992
And I give my opinions,
but it's like

1:01:31.094 --> 1:01:33.794
he doesn't even care, you know,
he doesn't even listen.

1:01:34.196 --> 1:01:37.332
And I don't even have
the strength to make him care,

1:01:37.434 --> 1:01:39.699
you know?

1:01:40.368 --> 1:01:43.004
And I don't know how much longer
I can go on feeling like...

1:01:45.210 --> 1:01:46.205
I don't matter.

1:01:51.141 --> 1:01:53.044
I did not see that coming.

1:01:53.447 --> 1:01:57.850
-Sorry, that was like, blah.
-Oh, no, it's okay.

1:01:57.985 --> 1:02:00.516
Ladies,
I don't mean to interrupt,

1:02:01.690 --> 1:02:02.892
but we have a problem.

1:02:03.628 --> 1:02:08.964
-Get in line.

1:02:09.532 --> 1:02:10.563
Oh, you're serious.

1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:23.473
I can't find my lunch anywhere.

1:02:24.175 --> 1:02:25.743
So let me get this straight.

1:02:26.046 --> 1:02:27.580
You've got these
anti-hypothermia

1:02:27.682 --> 1:02:28.883
space age blankets

1:02:29.085 --> 1:02:31.684
in your backpack,
you've got an epinephrine shot,

1:02:31.786 --> 1:02:32.953
a backup epinephrine shot,

1:02:33.055 --> 1:02:35.689
but you got no map,
no compass, nothing?

1:02:35.792 --> 1:02:37.090
<i>-Correctamundo.</i>

1:02:37.192 --> 1:02:40.795
-Oh, my stomach just ate itself.

1:02:41.164 --> 1:02:42.897
Oh, I forgot to mention
that my blood sugar

1:02:43.033 --> 1:02:45.066
was getting a little low,
so I ate your lunch.

1:02:46.601 --> 1:02:47.536
Come again?

1:02:47.638 --> 1:02:49.098
I was addressing a medical need.

1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:51.540
Hey, it's okay,<i> mi</i> amigo.

1:02:51.943 --> 1:02:55.311
When God closes a door,
he opens a Chick-fil-A.

1:02:55.713 --> 1:02:57.943
So you stole my lunch?

1:02:58.479 --> 1:03:01.880
This is amazing, you realize
we could die out here, right?

1:03:02.115 --> 1:03:03.781
Whoa, bucko, hey,
we don't need to

1:03:03.883 --> 1:03:05.017
look at it that way.

1:03:05.153 --> 1:03:06.850
We need to look at this
as an opportunity

1:03:06.952 --> 1:03:08.190
to grow our faith.

1:03:08.826 --> 1:03:10.859
You know what,
the only reason I came

1:03:10.961 --> 1:03:13.290
on this stupid hike
was to grow my faith.

1:03:13.392 --> 1:03:15.665
-Hey, let it out.
-Okay, I will.

1:03:15.900 --> 1:03:18.163
You know, I thought
maybe I'd come out here,

1:03:18.265 --> 1:03:20.403
he'd say something,
he'd show me something.

1:03:20.505 --> 1:03:22.400
Instead, I'm stuck here

1:03:22.535 --> 1:03:25.039
with Dr. Phil's demented
twin brother when I should be

1:03:25.141 --> 1:03:27.673
back at the camp singing
"Kumbaya" with my family.

1:03:27.908 --> 1:03:29.141
How's that make you feel?

1:03:29.244 --> 1:03:31.245
I'll tell you
how it makes me feel, all right?

1:03:31.413 --> 1:03:34.718
I feel like if God is in control
of all this, then I don't know

1:03:34.820 --> 1:03:36.612
if I'm really
that interested in faith.

1:03:44.858 --> 1:03:46.294
Please stop that.

1:03:46.964 --> 1:03:49.594
-Stop what?

1:03:49.696 --> 1:03:50.693
That.

1:03:50.962 --> 1:03:53.469
Stop this?

1:03:53.738 --> 1:03:59.107
-Yes, that.

1:04:01.543 --> 1:04:02.539
Can't.

1:04:08.214 --> 1:04:10.550
-May I see that?
-Hmm?

1:04:10.652 --> 1:04:12.120
Can I see that?

1:04:15.590 --> 1:04:16.652
Thanks.

1:04:24.165 --> 1:04:26.464
What you gonna do now,
little bald man?

1:04:42.415 --> 1:04:44.053
<i> You've reached</i>
<i>Tommy Ackerman,</i>

1:04:44.155 --> 1:04:45.889
<i>senior investment strategist</i>
<i>for Wiley and Edmund.</i>

1:04:45.991 --> 1:04:49.619
<i>-I'm not available right now.</i>

1:04:53.227 --> 1:04:55.194
So we've got
the sheriff's office,

1:04:55.430 --> 1:04:58.364
Park Services, and great team
of volunteers searching

1:04:58.466 --> 1:05:00.996
for your husbands right now.
They're gonna be out there

1:05:01.098 --> 1:05:03.371
for two hours...

1:05:04.074 --> 1:05:06.075
but they're gonna hit it again,
first light.

1:05:06.873 --> 1:05:08.143
And then what?

1:05:11.050 --> 1:05:13.281
You know, these guys
are really good at what they do.

1:05:14.050 --> 1:05:15.247
I think the best thing
for right now

1:05:15.349 --> 1:05:19.088
-is if y'all stay put.
-We stay put, sure.

1:05:20.157 --> 1:05:22.223
We just sit still,
stay put, thank you for that.

1:05:22.325 --> 1:05:24.323
We'll just stay put
while our husbands are out there

1:05:24.425 --> 1:05:26.260
that have never been
out there before, like...

1:05:28.762 --> 1:05:29.759
Joel?

1:05:35.440 --> 1:05:36.435
Hey, Grace?

1:05:38.037 --> 1:05:39.306
They're coming back.

1:05:40.104 --> 1:05:41.308
You hear me?

1:05:43.175 --> 1:05:44.410
I really believe that.

1:05:45.780 --> 1:05:47.116
I know that.

1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:49.712
I'm gonna pray for us, okay?

1:05:50.586 --> 1:05:51.615
Okay.

1:05:52.684 --> 1:05:54.321
Sometimes I like to pray
in my prayer language,

1:05:54.423 --> 1:05:58.358
-is that all right?
-Um, you mean like in tongues?

1:05:59.796 --> 1:06:01.130
-Like in Spanish.
-Oh,

1:06:01.232 --> 1:06:03.233
-yeah, that's good, that's good.

1:06:28.392 --> 1:06:33.459
-My dad plays the harmonica.
-Hmm, sounds like a good man.

1:06:35.460 --> 1:06:37.232
He never really came
around much.

1:06:38.835 --> 1:06:41.170
Still doesn't.

1:06:41.672 --> 1:06:42.738
And if I'm honest,

1:06:42.974 --> 1:06:45.872
I'm just living out
my greatest fear

1:06:45.974 --> 1:06:47.407
of becoming just like him.

1:06:48.945 --> 1:06:50.641
And the older my kids get...

1:06:52.946 --> 1:06:54.183
I realize, I...

1:06:55.312 --> 1:06:56.515
I don't know them.

1:07:00.191 --> 1:07:02.752
This may surprise you
to hear this, but, uh...

1:07:03.453 --> 1:07:05.095
I was afraid to have kids.

1:07:06.559 --> 1:07:08.131
My parents,
they did the best they could,

1:07:08.233 --> 1:07:10.226
but they didn't really leave me
with the best blueprint

1:07:10.328 --> 1:07:11.662
to raise my own kids with.

1:07:16.141 --> 1:07:18.537
And then I saw the twins
in the delivery room...

1:07:20.140 --> 1:07:21.474
holding each other...

1:07:23.042 --> 1:07:24.345
and this...

1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:27.148
extra valve
in my heart opened up,

1:07:27.250 --> 1:07:29.317
one I didn't even know
I had.

1:07:31.150 --> 1:07:32.650
I love them so much.

1:07:35.855 --> 1:07:38.656
And yet, I'm still afraid
I'm gonna mess them up somehow.

1:07:42.827 --> 1:07:46.136
My grandmother always said
it's, uh, family...

1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:49.505
it's God's plan
and our responsibility.

1:07:49.941 --> 1:07:54.373
-Hmm. I like that.
-Hmm. Yeah.

1:07:54.476 --> 1:07:56.739
Don't worry,<i> mi</i> amigo,
we are going to find

1:07:56.841 --> 1:07:59.545
our way back home
to our families, I promise.

1:08:01.116 --> 1:08:02.246
Now, that's a roaring fire.

1:08:02.348 --> 1:08:03.613
Oh, quick, get them off!

1:08:05.383 --> 1:08:06.483
-Ouch.
-Hot!

1:08:06.585 --> 1:08:07.958
-Stomp them out!
-Hot!

1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:11.187
-My leg hairs!
-Not today, Satan!

1:08:11.289 --> 1:08:13.559
-No, no.

1:08:16.261 --> 1:08:18.135
Oh, they look good.

1:08:19.297 --> 1:08:20.665
-Do they?
-Yeah.

1:08:35.451 --> 1:08:37.319
<i>Okay, Rescue Alpha.</i>

1:08:37.421 --> 1:08:40.619
<i>We're gonna call it a night.</i>
<i>We'll be back at 0500.</i>

1:08:50.601 --> 1:08:51.597
Okay.

1:08:55.338 --> 1:08:57.702
Look, I know
I don't ask for much, God...

1:09:00.073 --> 1:09:01.277
because...

1:09:02.743 --> 1:09:07.415
you know, I like to do
everything myself.

1:09:11.987 --> 1:09:13.355
But it turns out...

1:09:16.691 --> 1:09:21.858
that I really love him
and, um, and I need him, so...

1:09:27.432 --> 1:09:28.800
please bring him home.

1:10:01.369 --> 1:10:03.802
-Good morning.
-Hey, morning.

1:10:04.338 --> 1:10:06.342
-Hope I didn't wake you.
-No.

1:10:07.571 --> 1:10:08.773
How do I look?

1:10:12.645 --> 1:10:16.286
-Fantastic.
-That's right, fantastic.

1:10:17.318 --> 1:10:19.887
-Mom, Mom!
-What?

1:10:20.089 --> 1:10:21.390
Henry's gone.

1:10:22.323 --> 1:10:23.821
It says he went to go find dad.

1:10:35.866 --> 1:10:37.938
Okay, we believe
the boy is most likely

1:10:38.040 --> 1:10:39.241
in this area here,

1:10:39.543 --> 1:10:40.769
and the chances of survival
in this forest are falling

1:10:40.871 --> 1:10:42.477
by the hour
for all three of them,

1:10:42.913 --> 1:10:44.006
so we gotta move.

1:10:45.447 --> 1:10:48.715
-Grace, Grace!

1:10:49.285 --> 1:10:52.322
-Grace. Grace!
-What?

1:10:53.191 --> 1:10:54.387
I can't let you go
in there.

1:10:54.523 --> 1:10:57.185
You say that like
you can stop me.

1:10:57.587 --> 1:10:58.821
My son is out there.

1:10:59.024 --> 1:11:00.859
I understand, that's why
we're doubling our efforts.

1:11:00.961 --> 1:11:02.891
Yeah, that's great, it's just
not good enough, it's not.

1:11:02.994 --> 1:11:05.395
Grace,
that's not just some city park

1:11:05.497 --> 1:11:06.595
you're walking into there.

1:11:06.797 --> 1:11:08.669
It's the Ouachita
National Forest,

1:11:08.804 --> 1:11:11.638
some of the roughest terrain
you'll ever encounter, Grace!

1:11:12.737 --> 1:11:14.839
God knows
every square inch of it.

1:11:16.310 --> 1:11:17.644
He knows where they are.

1:11:24.121 --> 1:11:25.982
So when is he gonna tell us?

1:11:30.459 --> 1:11:32.254
Cookie,
I need to borrow your truck.

1:11:32.757 --> 1:11:34.262
-What for?
-It's an emergency.

1:11:34.397 --> 1:11:36.399
Oh, it sounds like
my kind of party.

1:11:43.668 --> 1:11:45.270
So, where are we going?

1:11:45.740 --> 1:11:47.641
We've got a little boy
to go rescue.

1:11:53.318 --> 1:11:55.510
<i> Mentorship lesson</i>
numero dos.

1:11:55.946 --> 1:11:57.954
Tell me about this,
uh, cell phone

1:11:58.056 --> 1:11:59.249
that you always seem to be on.

1:11:59.718 --> 1:12:01.518
This is amazing,
we're here

1:12:01.620 --> 1:12:02.686
in the middle of the woods,

1:12:02.921 --> 1:12:04.626
and yet I still seem
to have a nagging wife.

1:12:04.728 --> 1:12:06.891
Well, at least you have
a wife that cares enough to nag.

1:12:07.527 --> 1:12:09.694
Um, it's my job, right?

1:12:09.796 --> 1:12:12.094
I mean, some people
work in construction,

1:12:12.196 --> 1:12:14.737
some people work in a classroom.
I do most of my work

1:12:14.839 --> 1:12:15.835
on the phone.

1:12:16.504 --> 1:12:17.803
How do you set boundaries?

1:12:19.074 --> 1:12:20.069
For what?

1:12:21.138 --> 1:12:24.213
Well, I mean, if you work
in a construction yard,

1:12:24.315 --> 1:12:25.577
you wouldn't be driving
the bulldozer

1:12:25.679 --> 1:12:27.747
to the dinner table,
now would you, no.

1:12:30.087 --> 1:12:31.520
Try using the sharp side.

1:12:33.352 --> 1:12:35.323
Hmm, hmm.

1:12:35.692 --> 1:12:39.158
Yeah, it's not that easy, okay?
I'm up for a promotion.

1:12:39.694 --> 1:12:41.157
If I get it,
it changes everything, right?

1:12:41.259 --> 1:12:44.099
I mean, who doesn't want to
not have to worry about money?

1:12:44.535 --> 1:12:46.364
Get a new house,
a new car, don't have to worry

1:12:46.466 --> 1:12:48.135
about retirement, I mean--

1:12:48.337 --> 1:12:50.534
-ATVs!
-ATVs?

1:12:50.769 --> 1:12:54.510
-Hmm, what, ATVs?
-Help, somebody!

1:12:55.176 --> 1:12:56.442
Please help!

1:12:56.544 --> 1:12:58.013
Hey, hey, hey,
come on, let's go.

1:12:59.449 --> 1:13:01.983
No, no, this has
"Thou shalt not steal."

1:13:02.085 --> 1:13:03.219
Written all over it.

1:13:03.488 --> 1:13:05.086
We can cover ten times
the area with these, okay?

1:13:05.188 --> 1:13:06.388
We'll be back by dinner.

1:13:06.724 --> 1:13:08.583
Four wheelers just don't appear
in the middle of nowhere.

1:13:08.719 --> 1:13:09.987
They belong to somebody.

1:13:12.292 --> 1:13:13.359
Okay, okay.

1:13:13.694 --> 1:13:16.327
I'm sorry, I just,
I missed my family,

1:13:16.462 --> 1:13:18.765
and I'm so hungry.

1:13:22.634 --> 1:13:24.441
Tonight is taco night.

1:13:27.110 --> 1:13:28.577
No, it's stealing.

1:13:32.216 --> 1:13:34.748
I forgot about the guacamole.

1:13:36.647 --> 1:13:38.547
No, no, it's wrong.

1:13:43.092 --> 1:13:44.090
<i> Dad?</i>

1:13:46.390 --> 1:13:47.662
Dad!

1:13:57.105 --> 1:13:58.200
Hello?

1:14:06.617 --> 1:14:09.778
Okay, I'm done waiting,
we're losing daylight.

1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:11.818
-It's now or never.
-Hmm.

1:14:25.504 --> 1:14:27.163
-Did you say something?

1:14:30.372 --> 1:14:31.838
Well, hey, little fella.

1:14:33.775 --> 1:14:37.877
Who's daddy's big boy?
I'm daddy's big boy.

1:14:41.711 --> 1:14:43.014
Tommy?

1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:46.215
Tommy!

1:14:48.486 --> 1:14:49.724
Tommy!

1:14:52.264 --> 1:14:56.032
-Tommy!
-Please, stop screaming.

1:14:56.601 --> 1:14:59.229
-My head's killing me.
-My legs feel like jelly.

1:14:59.831 --> 1:15:01.604
That's the tranquilizer.

1:15:03.837 --> 1:15:06.534
Now it's rated
for a 700-pound primate.

1:15:07.170 --> 1:15:08.676
You're liable to feel
a little weak

1:15:08.778 --> 1:15:11.876
-in the knees for a spell.
-Wait, I know you guys.

1:15:12.212 --> 1:15:15.948
Yeah, yeah, you're on that,
uh, you're on that TV show,

1:15:16.050 --> 1:15:19.117
<i>-The Bigfoot Hunters.</i>
-Always nice to meet a fan.

1:15:19.653 --> 1:15:21.486
They tried to steal our ATVs,

1:15:21.655 --> 1:15:23.321
-you cornball joker.

1:15:23.590 --> 1:15:25.054
I retract my statement.

1:15:25.156 --> 1:15:26.661
We're... we're not...
we're not thieves.

1:15:26.763 --> 1:15:28.460
We're just trying
to get back to our families.

1:15:28.662 --> 1:15:30.364
But, you see, I got one little

1:15:30.533 --> 1:15:31.997
-teensy tiny problem.
-One.

1:15:32.099 --> 1:15:36.331
You see, I ain't never
met a thief who weren't a liar.

1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:40.710
Wow, I could sew that
on a pillow.

1:15:41.312 --> 1:15:42.807
-Thank you.
-I'm sorry, um,

1:15:42.909 --> 1:15:44.942
-were you calling him a liar?
-I did.

1:15:45.044 --> 1:15:47.383
That man is my friend
and he is no liar,

1:15:47.485 --> 1:15:48.782
and if you're calling
him a liar,

1:15:48.984 --> 1:15:51.553
you're calling me a liar,
and nobody calls me a liar.

1:15:51.655 --> 1:15:53.282
-Stop talking.
-You know what, we're fine.

1:15:53.384 --> 1:15:57.726
You can go on your way,
just skedaddle. Good day, sirs.

1:16:00.064 --> 1:16:01.631
I said good day.

1:16:02.397 --> 1:16:03.395
All right.

1:16:03.764 --> 1:16:05.399
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Bye now.

1:16:05.501 --> 1:16:07.366
He... he's just kidding, okay?

1:16:07.635 --> 1:16:09.732
We... we love your show, we do.

1:16:10.034 --> 1:16:11.471
-Oh.
-I'm not kidding,

1:16:11.573 --> 1:16:12.868
fame has gone to your head.

1:16:13.203 --> 1:16:16.877
No one watches your TV show,
now scram.

1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:18.509
-Come on.

1:16:18.844 --> 1:16:20.243
Please tell them you're kidding.

1:16:20.378 --> 1:16:22.212
-Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.
-Give me your honey pot.

1:16:22.381 --> 1:16:24.686
-But you said you wasn't hungry.
-The honey pot ain't for me,

1:16:24.788 --> 1:16:27.624
you doofus McSpaz-a-tron,
come on. Hand it over.

1:16:31.590 --> 1:16:35.731
Now.

1:16:38.670 --> 1:16:42.501
Now, these woods,
this is home to a lot more

1:16:42.603 --> 1:16:44.773
than just deer and coyote.

1:16:45.703 --> 1:16:47.770
Mm, mm, mm.

1:16:48.073 --> 1:16:49.644
Now, we'll come back
and untie you

1:16:49.746 --> 1:16:52.308
in a day or two
when we're done squatching,

1:16:52.611 --> 1:16:53.815
that is...

1:16:55.046 --> 1:16:57.346
if you ain't already
been tooked.

1:17:02.788 --> 1:17:03.785
Please don't go!

1:17:04.054 --> 1:17:05.688
-That was scary.

1:17:05.824 --> 1:17:08.192
Please, don't leave us!

1:17:10.031 --> 1:17:13.129
Look on the bright side,
we got our honey, huh?

1:17:13.232 --> 1:17:15.705
You don't understand,
they were our last hope.

1:17:17.336 --> 1:17:19.575
I'm starting to think
you don't want to be rescued.

1:17:19.678 --> 1:17:21.610
Well, clearly
I was using reverse psychology,

1:17:21.712 --> 1:17:23.273
and clearly I still need
some practice at it.

1:17:23.375 --> 1:17:26.346
The only thing that is clear
to me is how clueless

1:17:26.448 --> 1:17:27.649
you actually are.

1:17:27.885 --> 1:17:30.077
I mean, you can't be normal
for one minute, can you?

1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:32.146
Everything that comes out
of your mouth

1:17:32.248 --> 1:17:35.089
causes every bit of me
to cringe.

1:17:35.625 --> 1:17:37.054
It... it's like...
It... it's like

1:17:37.157 --> 1:17:40.395
your head is just
a... a giant cheese grater

1:17:40.497 --> 1:17:41.858
and I'm lactose intolerant.

1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:43.192
When you open up your mouth,

1:17:43.361 --> 1:17:46.368
it's just grade A cheddar
just starts coming out.

1:17:46.470 --> 1:17:48.435
It's just.

1:17:48.670 --> 1:17:50.000
And in the midst of all of that,

1:17:50.102 --> 1:17:52.168
I have to ask this question,
who...

1:17:52.370 --> 1:17:55.410
who greets people
by giving them back adjustments?

1:17:55.512 --> 1:17:57.472
Who in the world does that?

1:17:59.210 --> 1:18:02.146
-Well, I do.
-Listen, do me a favor.

1:18:02.315 --> 1:18:04.449
The next time you have
something that you just have

1:18:04.551 --> 1:18:06.386
to say, don't,

1:18:06.821 --> 1:18:09.484
because nobody
wants to hear you.

1:18:13.791 --> 1:18:14.995
I get it.

1:18:17.300 --> 1:18:18.295
I get it.

1:18:23.775 --> 1:18:25.669
You're the guy
that always gets picked, right?

1:18:27.545 --> 1:18:29.078
Never left
standing there,

1:18:29.881 --> 1:18:32.507
the third wheel in a bunch
of two-man buddy systems.

1:18:36.921 --> 1:18:42.022
Always invited to lunch,
always invited to the parties.

1:18:43.294 --> 1:18:44.420
And then there's me.

1:18:49.795 --> 1:18:52.362
Clueless, cringey...

1:18:54.867 --> 1:18:56.806
not normal Eddie Sanders.

1:18:57.903 --> 1:18:59.468
I've got news for you.

1:19:01.879 --> 1:19:06.046
God doesn't make junk,
and that includes me.

1:19:09.181 --> 1:19:11.018
No matter what
you may think of me...

1:19:12.883 --> 1:19:14.120
I'm not junk.

1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:23.829
I just don't know
what I would do...

1:19:24.398 --> 1:19:27.733
-if it was just me and mom.
-Look, they're gonna find them.

1:19:28.002 --> 1:19:30.972
Everything will be okay,
I'm sure of it.

1:19:34.844 --> 1:19:36.673
What are you...
what are you doing?

1:19:37.309 --> 1:19:40.817
-Come on, don't be a tease.
-Excuse me?

1:19:42.481 --> 1:19:47.418
Uh, okay, cool, um,
I'll catch you around, I guess.

1:20:04.167 --> 1:20:06.238
Wha... what?

1:20:07.644 --> 1:20:09.604
Yeah, see you around, I guess.

1:20:13.849 --> 1:20:18.019
-<i> Henry!</i>
-<i> Henry!</i>

1:20:19.588 --> 1:20:20.890
<i> Henry!</i>

1:20:23.654 --> 1:20:25.593
<i>Headquarters here, go ahead,</i>

1:20:25.696 --> 1:20:27.094
<i>-Rescue Alpha.</i>

1:20:27.196 --> 1:20:28.323
<i> We're setting</i>
<i>it down for the night.</i>

1:20:28.425 --> 1:20:30.092
<i>The trail ran cold</i>
<i>over an hour ago</i>

1:20:30.194 --> 1:20:31.729
<i>and the dogs are getting tired.</i>

1:21:14.740 --> 1:21:15.945
Hello?

1:21:16.774 --> 1:21:18.013
Dad?

1:21:18.976 --> 1:21:20.180
Is that you?

1:21:22.182 --> 1:21:24.348
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1:21:24.450 --> 1:21:27.256
I got you on camera,
so you can just come out...

1:21:28.656 --> 1:21:29.655
...please?

1:21:39.931 --> 1:21:41.936
Wolves?

1:21:42.071 --> 1:21:48.340
Wolves, wolves,
help, help! There's wolves!

1:21:57.014 --> 1:21:58.218
Henry?

1:22:19.241 --> 1:22:22.739
Hey, I'm really sorry
about what I said earlier.

1:22:23.575 --> 1:22:25.577
-It's fine, whatever.
-I just don't want to die

1:22:25.680 --> 1:22:26.675
out here.

1:22:29.516 --> 1:22:32.582
It may be happening
sooner than you think.

1:22:38.029 --> 1:22:41.525
-Oh, well, hello, little fella.

1:22:42.094 --> 1:22:47.333
Who's a good boy?

1:23:08.890 --> 1:23:10.422
I need one more chance.

1:23:14.729 --> 1:23:15.724
I get it now.

1:23:18.669 --> 1:23:20.663
Grace, Hannah, Henry...

1:23:22.231 --> 1:23:23.435
they need me.

1:23:25.537 --> 1:23:28.209
And I think
for the first time in my life...

1:23:29.447 --> 1:23:30.442
I'm ready.

1:23:33.913 --> 1:23:35.216
I'm ready, God.

1:23:40.056 --> 1:23:43.092
I've been going
in so many directions.

1:23:48.193 --> 1:23:49.791
I need to find true north.

1:23:53.836 --> 1:23:55.269
So if you'll have me...

1:23:57.367 --> 1:23:58.800
I'll give you everything.

1:24:03.807 --> 1:24:07.380
Just please give me
one more chance.

1:24:16.392 --> 1:24:21.695
Eddie, Eddie, the ropes,
they just broke, it's a miracle!

1:24:21.797 --> 1:24:22.957
-Oh.

1:24:23.627 --> 1:24:25.963
Well, well,
yeah, it's a miracle.

1:24:26.065 --> 1:24:27.233
I mean,

1:24:27.402 --> 1:24:29.902
it's been like
a... a nonstop prayer service

1:24:30.004 --> 1:24:31.305
on this side of the tree.

1:24:33.238 --> 1:24:34.440
Have you been crying?

1:24:36.339 --> 1:24:37.542
You've been crying.

1:24:39.583 --> 1:24:40.578
A little help?

1:24:53.059 --> 1:24:55.629
-Mom, Mom!

1:24:55.764 --> 1:24:58.200
Henry.

1:24:59.435 --> 1:25:02.430
I'm so sorry,
I looked for him all night.

1:25:02.533 --> 1:25:05.339
-I tried so hard.

1:25:06.910 --> 1:25:10.179
I couldn't find him. Sorry.

1:25:11.912 --> 1:25:12.907
Thank you.

1:25:17.815 --> 1:25:19.981
Me and you are gonna have
kids like that one day.

1:25:20.149 --> 1:25:21.355
Hmm?

1:25:41.373 --> 1:25:42.970
I don't feel good about this.

1:25:43.606 --> 1:25:45.577
It's our only chance, come on.

1:25:59.023 --> 1:26:00.229
Hmm.

1:26:05.166 --> 1:26:06.867
They've got cheddar wieners.

1:26:07.136 --> 1:26:09.098
-Get over here.

1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:10.471
Do you want one?

1:26:11.340 --> 1:26:14.771
See, Mr. Beef,
I told you them was thieves.

1:26:15.613 --> 1:26:17.708
Beef. Beef.

1:26:18.983 --> 1:26:21.178
-Morning.

1:26:21.547 --> 1:26:23.219
Put him in a choker,
will you?

1:26:24.220 --> 1:26:26.082
Thought you could
pull one over on us.

1:26:26.184 --> 1:26:27.586
No, look ahead.

1:26:30.093 --> 1:26:32.987
-Hi.
-Oh, hello again.

1:26:35.265 --> 1:26:37.800
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

1:26:38.302 --> 1:26:40.361
You wouldn't want to leave
your friend behind now,

1:26:40.830 --> 1:26:42.804
-would you?
-Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

1:26:43.374 --> 1:26:47.468
Come on, now, step away
from it nice and slow like.

1:26:47.636 --> 1:26:51.709
Yeah, nice and slow like.

1:26:52.311 --> 1:26:54.712
Well, well, well.

1:26:55.647 --> 1:26:57.786
What we gonna do
with these two now?

1:26:57.988 --> 1:26:59.884
Don't do anything crazy, okay?

1:27:00.621 --> 1:27:04.452
Just, um, think...
think about your TV show.

1:27:04.654 --> 1:27:07.093
-Oh, show's over.
-Huh?

1:27:07.195 --> 1:27:08.361
Yeah, the network canceled it.

1:27:08.463 --> 1:27:10.729
Is it because
you couldn't find bigfoot?

1:27:11.098 --> 1:27:12.131
You watch it too?

1:27:12.767 --> 1:27:15.029
Let me ask you something.
You know what it's like to have

1:27:15.131 --> 1:27:19.473
your dream come true
reality TV show canceled, huh?

1:27:20.073 --> 1:27:22.277
Do you? Do you!

1:27:22.379 --> 1:27:25.479
Uh, it's... it's just a really
specific question.

1:27:25.914 --> 1:27:27.176
No, huh, no.

1:27:27.678 --> 1:27:30.485
Well, it's very difficult.

1:27:30.887 --> 1:27:31.980
It's very difficult.

1:27:33.753 --> 1:27:36.688
And now I think
I'm gonna have to cancel you.

1:27:38.426 --> 1:27:40.560
Wait, that was unloaded
the whole time?

1:27:45.031 --> 1:27:46.197
Bigfoot!

1:27:46.299 --> 1:27:47.495
-What?
-Where, where?

1:27:47.597 --> 1:27:49.736
-Eddie, run!

1:27:52.574 --> 1:27:56.342
-I'll never walk again!
-Sir, please don't go.

1:27:56.477 --> 1:27:58.378
-No, you don't. L2.

1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:00.882
-L4. And sleep.

1:28:01.585 --> 1:28:07.389
-Eddie, you're a murderer.
-No, Tommy, I'm a chiropractor.

1:28:07.691 --> 1:28:08.757
Oh, oh.

1:28:20.737 --> 1:28:22.932
Come on!

1:28:25.403 --> 1:28:30.577
You are not Rambo.

1:28:39.484 --> 1:28:41.522
Pull to the left, baby.

1:28:53.066 --> 1:28:54.302
Drive!

1:28:54.471 --> 1:28:56.134
-Come on, it's gonna blow! Whoa!
-I got you,

1:28:56.236 --> 1:28:57.135
little Squatchie.

1:29:05.481 --> 1:29:07.445
-That was amazing,

1:29:07.581 --> 1:29:10.412
-Eddie, you did it.
-No, we did it.

1:29:28.901 --> 1:29:30.632
-Stop, stop, beaver, stop!

1:29:30.734 --> 1:29:32.135
-Whoa!
-Watch out!

1:29:57.897 --> 1:30:00.266
Bees, uh, I hate you,
I hate you, bees.

1:30:00.568 --> 1:30:02.763
I hate them,
I hate the bees!

1:30:02.865 --> 1:30:04.506
Hey, hey, hey, hold on, hold on.

1:30:05.669 --> 1:30:06.871
If that's the bees...

1:30:09.071 --> 1:30:11.377
-this is the trail
-We found the trail?

1:30:11.646 --> 1:30:13.145
-We found the trail.
-We found the trail.

1:30:14.617 --> 1:30:16.143
We found the trail,
we found the trail!

1:30:16.245 --> 1:30:17.815
We found the trail,
we found the trail.

1:30:17.917 --> 1:30:19.516
We found the trail,
we found the trail.

1:30:24.491 --> 1:30:25.453
-That just happened.
-Yeah.

1:30:26.958 --> 1:30:28.594
Oh, let me gather
this stuff right here.

1:30:28.696 --> 1:30:30.230
-I'll help you.
-You get going here, okay?

1:30:30.332 --> 1:30:31.431
No, you don't need to help.

1:30:31.533 --> 1:30:32.763
-No, it's good.
-You don't need to help,

1:30:32.866 --> 1:30:34.998
-I got-- I just need to--
-I got it.

1:30:38.469 --> 1:30:39.673
What is this?

1:30:41.739 --> 1:30:43.105
I didn't know it was in there.

1:30:47.817 --> 1:30:48.814
Hey.

1:30:49.482 --> 1:30:51.547
Hey! Look me in the eyes

1:30:51.649 --> 1:30:52.950
-and say that.

1:31:02.892 --> 1:31:05.193
I... I didn't know-- Okay, okay.

1:31:08.633 --> 1:31:09.967
We were never really lost.

1:31:11.974 --> 1:31:12.970
I, uh...

1:31:14.345 --> 1:31:16.072
I knew where we were
the whole time.

1:31:17.047 --> 1:31:18.107
Of course you did.

1:31:18.809 --> 1:31:20.714
-You see, the truth is--
-No.

1:31:22.149 --> 1:31:23.145
Don't.

1:31:24.220 --> 1:31:25.213
I don't want to hear it.

1:31:28.523 --> 1:31:30.658
Victoria doesn't love me
anymore!

1:31:34.927 --> 1:31:37.495
What are you talking about?

1:31:37.730 --> 1:31:40.533
She... she doesn't
love me anymore.

1:31:40.635 --> 1:31:42.302
We're just...
we're just roommates,

1:31:42.404 --> 1:31:43.803
just... just raising our kids.

1:31:45.608 --> 1:31:49.175
Divorce isn't an option,
so we just exist.

1:31:51.747 --> 1:31:53.748
She doesn't even want
to be around me...

1:31:53.850 --> 1:31:56.146
...so I just, uh, I just thought
if... if they'd think...

1:31:56.248 --> 1:32:00.182
...that I was hurt or even dead
and then miraculously returned,

1:32:00.284 --> 1:32:02.558
-then things would be--
-No, no, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:32:06.055 --> 1:32:08.025
Let me make sure
I understand this.

1:32:09.126 --> 1:32:12.766
You're stuck
in a passionless marriage...

1:32:13.767 --> 1:32:17.334
so you dragged me,
a complete stranger,

1:32:18.037 --> 1:32:22.006
into this twisted,
manipulated, made up story.

1:32:22.842 --> 1:32:24.577
You almost
get the both of us killed.

1:32:24.679 --> 1:32:28.115
At the least,
you wreck our wives

1:32:28.284 --> 1:32:30.218
and children, for what?

1:32:30.654 --> 1:32:32.679
So you can come in
and sweep her off her feet?

1:32:33.482 --> 1:32:36.083
Hmm, well, I don't know
about sweeping her off her feet,

1:32:36.185 --> 1:32:37.692
but I really thought
if we could--

1:32:41.296 --> 1:32:42.323
Your wife was right.

1:32:43.192 --> 1:32:44.829
No, we have to finish
this together.

1:32:44.931 --> 1:32:47.966
-We're finished.
-I can't go back by myself.

1:32:53.540 --> 1:32:54.907
You stay away from me.

1:33:00.413 --> 1:33:01.848
Oh, God, no.

1:33:11.992 --> 1:33:14.993
-Hey. Here you go.
-Thank you.

1:33:22.966 --> 1:33:24.706
Hey, come on, it's dad!

1:33:25.241 --> 1:33:26.205
There he is.

1:33:31.479 --> 1:33:34.111
Tommy? Tommy!

1:33:35.615 --> 1:33:36.646
-Tommy!
-Grace, Grace!

1:33:36.748 --> 1:33:38.453
-Tommy, Tommy?
-Grace?

1:33:41.554 --> 1:33:42.655
I thought you were--

1:33:42.857 --> 1:33:45.694
I'm never leaving you again,
never.

1:33:48.659 --> 1:33:49.627
Dad!

1:33:49.730 --> 1:33:52.998
-Oh, come here.

1:33:55.639 --> 1:33:57.105
I was looking for you
in the woods

1:33:57.207 --> 1:33:58.170
all night by myself.

1:33:58.506 --> 1:33:59.604
-What?
-Um.

1:34:00.073 --> 1:34:03.138
I'm sorry, I just wanted you
to be proud of me.

1:34:03.307 --> 1:34:07.544
I couldn't be
more proud of you.

1:34:07.980 --> 1:34:09.850
You're perfect
just the way you are.

1:34:10.981 --> 1:34:13.252
-Hi.
-I love you, sweetheart.

1:34:13.454 --> 1:34:14.888
-I love you.
-Oh.

1:34:17.820 --> 1:34:19.024
Where is he?

1:34:20.757 --> 1:34:22.060
Where's Eddie?

1:34:24.931 --> 1:34:26.300
-<i> Papi.</i>
-Dad!

1:34:34.771 --> 1:34:36.041
Let's go.

1:34:38.915 --> 1:34:41.981
I thought
you weren't coming back.

1:35:03.031 --> 1:35:04.234
What you got there?

1:35:05.635 --> 1:35:10.007
I was thinking about that jar
with all of those beads in it,

1:35:10.110 --> 1:35:13.410
and I think it's just
a really terrible idea.

1:35:15.747 --> 1:35:17.280
Me too.

1:35:23.957 --> 1:35:26.858
How about
instead of taking beads out,

1:35:27.327 --> 1:35:30.297
we put beads in for every day
that we have with each other

1:35:30.399 --> 1:35:31.492
from this moment on?

1:35:33.100 --> 1:35:38.037
Mom, I'm gonna need you
my first day of college.

1:35:38.907 --> 1:35:42.844
I'm gonna need you
for my first real job...

1:35:44.074 --> 1:35:48.248
for my first serious boyfriend.

1:35:52.183 --> 1:35:54.317
Mom, I'm gonna need you
for everything.

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:02.094
So--

1:36:19.311 --> 1:36:20.882
-You see the kids?

1:36:20.984 --> 1:36:23.047
Oh, I told them to get us a seat
next to Tommy and Grace.

1:36:23.150 --> 1:36:24.920
Oh, no, bad idea.
Why don't we just let them

1:36:25.022 --> 1:36:26.886
have their own personal space
for the last night of camp

1:36:26.988 --> 1:36:28.516
-because that's a big deal.
-Hey, Eddie?

1:36:30.822 --> 1:36:32.025
I need to talk...

1:36:33.626 --> 1:36:34.623
and I just...

1:36:35.092 --> 1:36:38.262
I need you to just listen, okay?

1:36:41.663 --> 1:36:44.301
I've been praying for God
to change some things...

1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:46.204
in our marriage.

1:36:48.539 --> 1:36:52.474
But what I realized is that
the change starts with me.

1:36:54.476 --> 1:36:56.814
God calls husbands
to love their wives

1:36:56.916 --> 1:36:58.314
like Christ loves the church--

1:36:58.416 --> 1:37:00.449
-Vic, let's be real clear--
-Eddie...

1:37:01.755 --> 1:37:03.287
God doesn't control us.

1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:07.324
He doesn't make
all the decisions for us.

1:37:08.323 --> 1:37:10.591
He doesn't take away our voice.

1:37:13.303 --> 1:37:14.870
And he loves...

1:37:15.803 --> 1:37:17.565
what I have to say.

1:37:18.936 --> 1:37:20.436
That is what I need.

1:37:23.480 --> 1:37:25.045
I need my voice back.

1:37:31.121 --> 1:37:34.588
-Let's hear it for the Brewers!

1:37:34.690 --> 1:37:36.155
Woo-woo, sugar bear!

1:37:41.729 --> 1:37:42.956
Look at that.

1:37:43.592 --> 1:37:46.929
Now, our next award
is the Badge of Courage.

1:37:47.098 --> 1:37:48.900
Now, this comes as no surprise.

1:37:49.069 --> 1:37:51.066
You've all heard the story
of heroism

1:37:51.168 --> 1:37:53.672
and the conquering of nature.

1:37:54.041 --> 1:37:57.872
Well, this award
is being given to...

1:37:59.515 --> 1:38:00.240
...Eddie Sanders...

1:38:00.342 --> 1:38:01.675
-...for saving Tommy

1:38:01.777 --> 1:38:03.243
from choking to death
in the first night of camp.

1:38:19.161 --> 1:38:20.364
Thank you, Cookie.

1:38:21.703 --> 1:38:22.968
Don't go anywhere, Eddie.

1:38:23.204 --> 1:38:26.639
You see, that Badge of Courage
has earned you

1:38:27.109 --> 1:38:30.973
-an extra 10,000 points...

1:38:31.075 --> 1:38:32.208
...making the Sanders

1:38:32.310 --> 1:38:34.582
the winners
of the Camp Katokwah Cup

1:38:34.684 --> 1:38:36.545
for the third year in a row!

1:38:47.257 --> 1:38:48.591
Mind if I say something?

1:38:48.693 --> 1:38:49.690
No.

1:38:52.996 --> 1:38:54.200
Friends, um...

1:38:55.499 --> 1:38:57.973
thank you for this great honor,
but, um...

1:39:01.039 --> 1:39:02.670
I... I can't accept it.

1:39:04.810 --> 1:39:07.147
Um...

1:39:09.848 --> 1:39:12.449
I'm...

1:39:15.722 --> 1:39:16.750
I'm a fake.

1:39:20.026 --> 1:39:21.689
I've made my wife miserable.

1:39:22.928 --> 1:39:25.363
Vic, you're right.

1:39:27.203 --> 1:39:30.764
I have not loved you
like Christ loved the church.

1:39:33.807 --> 1:39:35.109
And I am so sorry.

1:39:36.746 --> 1:39:39.146
That's on me, that's on me.

1:39:39.881 --> 1:39:41.478
I'm gonna go down there, okay?

1:39:43.085 --> 1:39:45.482
The perception I've made
of my family, uh...

1:39:47.723 --> 1:39:49.057
well, it's a trophy...

1:39:50.320 --> 1:39:52.390
it's a golden idol, which, um...

1:39:54.063 --> 1:39:57.626
-well, it makes me, uh...
-A liar?

1:40:01.668 --> 1:40:02.664
Yeah.

1:40:03.969 --> 1:40:05.238
The truth is I...

1:40:07.075 --> 1:40:09.077
I got the two of us
lost in the woods.

1:40:11.110 --> 1:40:13.745
And I did it on purpose.

1:40:19.920 --> 1:40:21.086
An ill-conceived attempt

1:40:21.188 --> 1:40:23.822
to try to win
the affections back

1:40:23.924 --> 1:40:26.721
from my wife, I'm sorry.

1:40:32.462 --> 1:40:35.070
-Hey, hey, here, I got it.
-Hmm?

1:40:35.637 --> 1:40:36.632
I got it.

1:40:39.702 --> 1:40:44.211
I think, um,
when we were in the forest...

1:40:46.346 --> 1:40:49.811
I think we both learned
a lot about life...

1:40:53.622 --> 1:40:54.617
...faith...

1:40:56.823 --> 1:40:58.159
and family.

1:41:00.857 --> 1:41:03.794
That wouldn't have happened
if we didn't get lost

1:41:03.896 --> 1:41:04.996
in the woods.

1:41:05.098 --> 1:41:07.663
See, I told you, God had a plan.

1:41:08.132 --> 1:41:09.230
-Shut it.
-Okay.

1:41:09.399 --> 1:41:10.732
-Seriously.
-Mm-hmm.

1:41:12.035 --> 1:41:13.240
Yeah.

1:41:15.275 --> 1:41:19.708
Um. What I'm trying
to say is, uh...

1:41:22.510 --> 1:41:24.185
I've been forgiven a lot.

1:41:29.022 --> 1:41:31.852
So how can I not forgive?

1:41:33.958 --> 1:41:35.163
Yeah.

1:41:38.027 --> 1:41:39.233
Hey.

1:41:41.934 --> 1:41:42.933
I forgive you.

1:41:43.168 --> 1:41:45.536
-Hmm, me?
-Yeah, you.

1:42:05.555 --> 1:42:07.792
-You deserve this.
-Oh, I know.

1:42:13.165 --> 1:42:14.262
Come on, guys.

1:42:14.597 --> 1:42:16.036
You were terrible
at bubble ball,

1:42:16.138 --> 1:42:17.898
but you are great
at everything else.

1:42:31.117 --> 1:42:32.682
Thank you for hearing me.

1:42:34.153 --> 1:42:35.652
You're worth listening to.

1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:39.722
-So you'd better get used to it.

1:42:40.762 --> 1:42:41.757
I love you.

1:42:42.591 --> 1:42:44.326
I love you, too, Eddie Sanders.

1:42:53.776 --> 1:42:54.873
-Hey.
-Hmm?

1:42:55.009 --> 1:42:56.310
You wanna play us out?

1:42:56.977 --> 1:42:58.675
I'd love to. Um...
