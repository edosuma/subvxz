WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.096
Follow yourselfTo the top of a mountain

00:13.180 --> 00:15.641
Answer the callYeah, be the believer

00:15.724 --> 00:18.852
Throw your fears like a wishInto a fountain

00:19.436 --> 00:22.898
Like a warrior

00:22.981 --> 00:25.192
Whatever you might beWhoever you are

00:25.275 --> 00:28.737
You're a warrior

00:31.031 --> 00:33.450
"The Pwettiest Pony."

00:37.955 --> 00:41.250
How cool were those new jousting moveswe learned at Lil Rumblers, Pony?

00:41.333 --> 00:45.045
We were all like,"Make way for Pinecone and Pony,

00:45.128 --> 00:47.297
the joust masters!"

00:53.178 --> 00:56.056
Yeah! That was close enough.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.016
Drink it in, Pony.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.935
The Barbarian Bowl,

01:00.018 --> 01:02.437
home to someof the greatest warriors in the land.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.647
Yes.

01:04.730 --> 01:08.068
And home to somepretty excellent corn dogs too.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.446
So, you ready to get ina little jousting practice?

01:25.210 --> 01:27.254
What kind of competition is this?

01:28.380 --> 01:31.884
Welcome to the annual Pwettiest Pony Show,

01:31.967 --> 01:35.846
where only one pony will take homethe coveted Cutesy-Wutesy award,

01:35.929 --> 01:39.308
but all the ponieswill take home our hearts.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.310
Isn't that right, Gladys?

01:41.393 --> 01:43.896
You lost me at "cutesy-wutesy."

01:44.771 --> 01:45.772
All right.

01:46.481 --> 01:49.234
These ponies are trying to be cute?

01:50.027 --> 01:52.988
Why would anyone want to be cute?

01:53.071 --> 01:56.617
Come on, Pony. We'll find another placeto practice our moves.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.784
Pony?

02:07.044 --> 02:08.961
Pony, you okay?

02:10.923 --> 02:14.551
Hold up. You wantto enter this competition?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.978
Okay. I'll sign you up.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.064
But don't tell anyone.

02:27.147 --> 02:31.318
This kinda thing could seriously damagemy reputation as a super tough,

02:31.401 --> 02:33.320
grown-up warrior.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.406
What a pretty flower.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.495
Hi. I'm a very tough warrior,

02:41.578 --> 02:45.290
and I'd like to sign up my ponyfor the competition.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.667
He's pretty tough too.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.214
And you're gonna be his partner?

02:52.297 --> 02:55.008
What? Why would you think that?

02:55.092 --> 02:57.928
'Cause ponies need a partner to compete.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.012
See?

03:01.139 --> 03:03.392
But I can't dress up like that.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.352
It's so…

03:05.435 --> 03:07.938
so cute.

03:08.939 --> 03:13.277
How could he think that I,a warrior of sure-to-be-great renown,

03:13.360 --> 03:16.905
would be caught prancing aroundlike some ballerina?

03:16.989 --> 03:19.575
Now, this is more our speed.

03:19.658 --> 03:23.120
Jousting, training, getting huge.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.204
Pony?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.123
Pony?

03:27.207 --> 03:32.129
And the pwettiest pony is Pony!

03:34.464 --> 03:36.091
Pony?

03:38.135 --> 03:41.638
Pony, something tells meyou're not in the mood for jousting.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.601
That competition means that muchto you, pal?

03:46.602 --> 03:50.731
Well, if it's that important to you,

03:51.356 --> 03:55.027
I guess I could compete as your partner.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.658
But if we're in it, we're in it to win it. But if we're in it, we're in it to win it.

04:01.742 --> 04:05.621
I'm talking total cuteness domination.You with me?

04:08.332 --> 04:10.876
We have got a lot of work to do.

04:32.731 --> 04:36.818
Hi. I'd like to sign upmy pony and I for the competition.

04:36.902 --> 04:40.614
So, Miss "I'm a tough warrior"has had a change of--

04:44.243 --> 04:48.038
Heart. Pure unadulterated heart.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.041
My apologies. Go right on in.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.964
Thank you,Marigold and Buttercup.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.259
I'm sure you smellas sweet as you look. I'm sure you smellas sweet as you look.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.844
Who do we have next, Gladys?

05:01.927 --> 05:05.097
Another vision from my nightmares.

05:05.597 --> 05:09.810
That's right.It's Witchy Wanda and Lil Magic.

05:09.893 --> 05:13.730
And they're casting a spell on us

05:13.814 --> 05:16.775
with a bewitching cape and cap combo!

05:16.859 --> 05:21.446
Well, that brings usto the end of our introductions.

05:21.530 --> 05:24.658
It's time to get this competition started!

05:24.741 --> 05:26.952
It is only just starting?

05:27.035 --> 05:28.620
Not without us, it's not!

05:29.246 --> 05:30.247
Hold on.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.876
Two new competitorshave just entered the arena,

05:33.959 --> 05:37.462
and boy, are they bringing the cute!

05:37.546 --> 05:40.674
Pinecone? And Pony? It cannot be.

05:40.757 --> 05:45.554
Get ready to eat our dust.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.894
I mean, best of luck to all of you.

05:54.813 --> 05:59.693
For our first event,we have the Precious Pony Tea Party.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.926
Next up isthe Get to Know Your Pony event.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.472
Must I deliver this line?

06:30.474 --> 06:33.977
"What is your pony-wony's

06:34.061 --> 06:37.731
most favoritest foodie-woodie?"

06:37.814 --> 06:39.525
That's easy.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.026
Carrots.

06:43.987 --> 06:46.448
Which is my favorite food too

06:46.532 --> 06:50.077
because me and Ponyhave everything in common.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.000
Next up is our Pony Fashion Show.

07:10.013 --> 07:13.392
It's too cute.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.188
What an adorableand exciting day of competition,

07:18.272 --> 07:19.481
eh, Gladys?

07:23.735 --> 07:25.070
Yes.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.531
Very stimulating.

07:27.614 --> 07:32.786
Unfortunately, only three teamscan advance to the final round.

07:32.870 --> 07:37.374
First up,we have Witchy Wanda and Lil Magic!

07:37.457 --> 07:41.336
Next, Marigold and Buttercup.

07:42.546 --> 07:46.175
And finally, Pinecone and Pony!

07:46.967 --> 07:48.927
Yes! All right!

07:50.679 --> 07:52.848
And now, for our final event,

07:52.931 --> 07:56.643
the Pony and Partner Dance-off!

07:56.727 --> 07:59.354
Hold up. We have to dance?

08:08.197 --> 08:11.116
But warriors don't dance.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.369
Only on the lawns of our enemies.

08:14.453 --> 08:19.082
Don't worry, Pony.I've got this. No problemo.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.008
Okay. Maybe slight problemo.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.971
Thank you, Marigold and Buttercup.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.600
You truly are lords of the dance.

08:38.809 --> 08:44.149
And last but not least,let's hear it for Pinecone and Pony,

08:44.232 --> 08:46.318
who will surely not disappoint us.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.124
-What's going on?-What's happening? -What's going on?-What's happening?

09:02.376 --> 09:05.504
Oh, dear. It appears Pineconeis having some difficulty

09:05.587 --> 09:08.423
with her dance moves, and it is not cute.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.821
Pony, what are you doing?

09:30.904 --> 09:35.158
We're supposed to be dancing,not jousting.

09:37.703 --> 09:40.038
I like your thinking, pal.

09:40.122 --> 09:43.250
Let's show 'em what a coupleof joust masters can do.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.910
What a comeback.

10:17.993 --> 10:21.371
Yes! It was a dance of warriors!

10:21.455 --> 10:26.293
You have brought new meaningto the phrase "cutesy-wutesy."

10:26.877 --> 10:31.089
And now, it is my pleasureto announce the winners

10:31.173 --> 10:33.383
of the Pwettiest Pony Show.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.639
Pinecone and Pony!

10:42.643 --> 10:46.730
You did it, pal! You're a cuteness master!

10:52.569 --> 10:56.365
May we present your winning trophy.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.700
What?

10:58.784 --> 11:01.703
We get a trophy? We get a trophy?

11:01.787 --> 11:05.374
This rules! This is awesome!

11:05.457 --> 11:06.667
This is…

11:07.668 --> 11:09.545
so cute.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.255
That's right.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.215
And it's full of lavender bubble bath.

11:17.052 --> 11:18.762
How delightful.

11:18.846 --> 11:22.432
Shall we return homefor a warrior's bath, noble steed?

11:24.309 --> 11:26.270
Maybe we can do mud masks too.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.897
Or mud baths.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.108
Or just wrestle in the mud.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.862
"Try This Club On For Size."

11:39.950 --> 11:41.410
Begin.

11:58.802 --> 12:00.846
Yeah! Take that, wall. Yeah! Take that, wall.

12:01.847 --> 12:03.640
Exceptional!

12:05.434 --> 12:06.977
Thanks for the assist, pal.

12:08.061 --> 12:11.565
We crushed that challenge warrior style.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.402
Hey, Hawthorn.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.988
Did ya see me show that wall who's boss?

12:18.071 --> 12:21.158
Sorry, Pinecone, but I was studying.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.996
My Wiz Kids class was really hard today.We had to make rainbows.

12:28.582 --> 12:32.794
Yeah, that sounds really hard.Good one, Hawth.

12:32.878 --> 12:33.754
Hey!

12:33.837 --> 12:36.840
I didn't laugh when your Lil Rumblerspop quiz was all about

12:36.924 --> 12:38.634
how to give the proper stink eye.

12:38.717 --> 12:41.261
That's because stink eyeis very important.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.680
It's a warrior's first line of defense.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.186
I see.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.272
Well, making rainbowsis actually very challenging.

12:52.356 --> 12:58.362
Maybe for a spell, but it couldn't beas hard as all that warrior stuff I do.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.614
Did you see that wall? Did you see that wall?

13:00.697 --> 13:04.117
Making rainbows may not usethe same kinds of muscles,

13:04.201 --> 13:07.746
but it uses the most importantmuscle of all!

13:08.330 --> 13:09.331
Your biceps?

13:10.582 --> 13:12.042
Your mind.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.503
If you don't believe me,

13:14.586 --> 13:17.005
why don't you come to Wiz Kids tomorrow?

13:18.757 --> 13:20.342
That sounds like a challenge,

13:20.425 --> 13:23.846
and Pinecone and Ponynever back down from a challenge.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.013
Right, pal?

13:28.684 --> 13:30.894
Hey there, Wiz Kids!

13:31.937 --> 13:34.773
Are you ready to do some magic?

13:36.984 --> 13:38.527
Hey there!

13:39.403 --> 13:40.654
Sorry about that.

13:40.737 --> 13:43.031
You know how it is when you're too pumped.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.826
Hey, Pinecone. Pony.

13:45.909 --> 13:49.746
Blaise and I would like to welcome youto the Wiz Kids!

13:49.830 --> 13:51.748
I hope you brought your best thinking cap.

13:51.832 --> 13:52.916
I know I did.

13:53.584 --> 13:55.210
It's my wizard's cap.

13:55.294 --> 13:59.840
Hmm. I don't have a cap,but I did bring my best lance.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.343
Hey!

14:04.595 --> 14:06.221
You won't be needing that here.

14:06.305 --> 14:09.850
Unless it's to battlethose pesky wormwort stains!

14:10.601 --> 14:12.102
You're so funny, Hawth.

14:15.147 --> 14:20.819
Hello class!

14:21.945 --> 14:25.032
Looks like we havesome special guests joining us today.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.284
Welcome, Pinecone and Pony.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.036
Thanks, Greymoon.

14:29.119 --> 14:34.291
I just wanna say how excited we areto crush this challenge

14:34.374 --> 14:36.627
and kick this lesson in the butt.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.379
Am I right, people?

14:44.092 --> 14:47.179
Thank youfor that rousing speech, Pinecone.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.557
It was very… louder than usual.

14:50.641 --> 14:53.268
Now, if everyone could goto their workstations, please.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.527
Pinecone.You guys can work over here. Next to me. Pinecone.You guys can work over here. Next to me.

15:02.736 --> 15:06.740
And here's a spell book I got for you.I drew a picture of us inside.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.495
I'm a wizard, not an artist.

15:11.578 --> 15:16.500
Today you shall be continuingthe difficult task of rainbow making.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.961
Well, difficult for some.

15:25.717 --> 15:26.718
Yeah!

15:27.886 --> 15:30.764
No, thank you.No, no. Stop. Stop it.

15:30.848 --> 15:33.642
I can't waitto make a rainbow just like that,

15:33.725 --> 15:35.769
only with even more colors.

15:35.853 --> 15:40.274
Like blurple! And florange!

15:41.692 --> 15:44.027
I'm glad you're excited, Pinecone.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.363
But remember what Greymoon always says.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.950
"Stay out of my carrot patch,Pinecone and Pony"?

15:51.159 --> 15:52.411
No.

15:52.494 --> 15:55.581
"Care before action brings satisfaction."

15:55.664 --> 15:57.332
Don't worry about us, Hawth.

15:57.416 --> 16:02.212
Pony and I have never met a challengewe couldn't face warrior style. Pony and I have never met a challengewe couldn't face warrior style.

16:02.296 --> 16:03.297
Right, pal?

16:07.467 --> 16:12.014
Step one, add a pinch of stardust.

16:14.975 --> 16:18.687
That looks pretty cool,but remember how Gladys always says,

16:18.770 --> 16:22.316
"To get over a wall, give it your all."

16:23.108 --> 16:26.778
Well, if a little powdermakes a little glow,

16:26.862 --> 16:29.907
then all the powderwill make all the glow.

16:35.871 --> 16:37.915
My retinas.

16:43.545 --> 16:46.590
I might have added a little too much.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.966
What do you think, Pony?

16:52.804 --> 16:58.143
Next, add a Caspian crystal,which you'll know by its pinkish hue.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.188
Hue of pink. Got it. Hue of pink. Got it.

17:02.898 --> 17:03.899
Come on.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.609
How am I supposed to knowwhich pink is the right pink?

17:07.736 --> 17:09.655
No time for books, Pony.

17:09.738 --> 17:14.451
As Gladys always says,"To be great, don't hesitate."

17:16.744 --> 17:19.790
Cool, it's doing something. What's next?

17:23.585 --> 17:27.589
Next, we wantto give our potions a gentle stir.

17:28.590 --> 17:31.051
Not now, Pony.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.136
I'm in the groove.

17:34.471 --> 17:38.183
As Gladys always says,"Go fast, or come in last."

17:38.267 --> 17:42.938
No, Pinecone, you might wantto slow down a bit.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.898
Pinecone? Pinecone.

17:44.982 --> 17:45.983
Pinecone!

17:47.359 --> 17:48.944
Hey. Looking good, Pony!

17:50.112 --> 17:52.322
All righty, class,

17:52.406 --> 17:57.536
your potions should now be purpleand smelling of warm banana muffins.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.959
Pony, please say that was you.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.837
Why isn't it working?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.882
I've been doing everything we learnedfrom Lil Rumblers.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.967
I don't get it.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.805
Hawthorn,your potion smells good enough to eat.

18:16.889 --> 18:19.016
I really don't get it.

18:22.769 --> 18:28.901
It's time to add the finaland most difficult ingredient of all,

18:30.235 --> 18:34.489
unicorn tears of joy!

18:35.449 --> 18:38.702
I know it sounds nice,but it's actually quite temperamental.

18:42.039 --> 18:46.335
Hey, Pinecone, this partis extra tricky.

18:46.418 --> 18:47.544
You want some help?

18:48.837 --> 18:50.672
Nah, I'm good.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.134
All right, Blaise. We can do this.

18:54.218 --> 18:55.677
Like Greymoon says,

18:55.761 --> 18:59.932
"The spell works nicewhen you're precise."

19:09.316 --> 19:12.653
Don't take it too hard, Hawthy.You can't win 'em all.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.450
-Well done.-You're a wiz, Hawth.

19:18.534 --> 19:22.788
I did it. Oh, my stars. I actually did it!

19:22.871 --> 19:25.541
Indeed. Could I get an autograph?

19:25.624 --> 19:28.794
Make it out to "best teacher ever."

19:29.503 --> 19:32.631
Don't worry, Pony. We can do it too.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.299
Warrior style!

19:37.427 --> 19:39.388
Pinecone. Wait. No!

19:48.856 --> 19:50.732
Take cover, class!

19:56.446 --> 19:57.781
My rainbow!

19:58.532 --> 20:03.412
Elements of water and light,make this storm calm and right. Elements of water and light,make this storm calm and right.

20:13.046 --> 20:16.216
Sorry about your rainbow, Hawthorn.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.344
Guess this magic stuff's a little harderthan I thought.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.432
You guess? You never even tried!

20:23.515 --> 20:26.059
Even though you knowhow important it is to me!

20:26.143 --> 20:30.272
Well, what's the big deal?It's just a bunch of potions and spells.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.192
I think you should go.

20:34.818 --> 20:35.861
Fine.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.404
Come on, Pony.

20:39.990 --> 20:41.491
What's Hawthorn's problem?

20:41.575 --> 20:44.119
I tried to make the potion,but it was hard.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.454
And confusing.

20:45.537 --> 20:49.249
When we're at Lil Rumblers,I know exactly what to do.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.751
One of these!

20:51.502 --> 20:52.753
Or one of these.

20:54.630 --> 20:56.215
Or even one of these!

21:06.016 --> 21:10.562
Hawthorn loves wizard stuffas much as I love warrior stuff.

21:12.731 --> 21:15.317
I totally ruined his big moment.

21:16.860 --> 21:20.781
But I'm going to make it right.Warrior style!

21:21.698 --> 21:23.283
I mean, wizard style.

21:30.499 --> 21:31.583
Who's there?

21:32.835 --> 21:35.337
Pinecone, what are you doing here?

21:35.420 --> 21:38.924
Making a little magic!

21:39.007 --> 21:41.051
Hey, you did it!

21:41.635 --> 21:43.846
No, you did it.

21:43.929 --> 21:47.140
It took me all nightjust to make this teeny, tiny spark.

21:47.224 --> 21:50.519
It's nothinglike the amazing rainbow you made.

21:50.602 --> 21:53.438
Which I ruined. Sorry, Hawth.

21:53.522 --> 21:54.731
It's okay.

21:54.815 --> 21:58.485
You know, I can help you makethat rainbow even bigger if you want?

21:59.486 --> 22:00.529
Yes, please. Yes, please.

22:00.612 --> 22:02.239
Cool, be right there.

22:04.074 --> 22:05.075
Got it!

22:06.618 --> 22:11.123
Three dashes of newt water.A pinch of werewolf hair.

22:11.206 --> 22:14.334
Then a clockwise stir at a medium pace.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.337
Yes!

22:17.421 --> 22:20.591
Hawthorn, you're a real wiz.

22:20.674 --> 22:23.927
Kinda like how you're a wiz of warrioring?

22:24.011 --> 22:27.681
Hey, maybe you can comewith us to Lil Rumblers tomorrow.

22:28.682 --> 22:30.475
Sure, how hard could it be?

22:35.439 --> 22:37.274
You and I

22:37.357 --> 22:40.027
Adventurers brave and free

22:40.903 --> 22:45.157
Side by sideTogether we'll always be

22:45.240 --> 22:49.745
Thick as thieves

22:50.746 --> 22:55.209
Thick as thieves
