I'm calling
from the Sundance Institute.

17:36.780 --> 17:40.870
We loved your screenplay.

17:40.910 --> 17:42.290
(quietly):
Yes.

17:42.330 --> 17:43.790
(exhales)

17:43.830 --> 17:45.830
Which one?
(chuckles)

17:45.870 --> 17:47.460
Uh...

17:47.500 --> 17:49.290
one about the four 20-somethings

17:49.340 --> 17:51.670
trying to find their way
in Bushwick?

17:53.670 --> 17:55.670
And one of them's...

17:55.720 --> 17:58.010
a ghost of...

17:58.050 --> 18:00.600
David Bowie?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.850
Tuesdays with Ziggy?

18:02.890 --> 18:05.600
(chuckles): Oh!
Wow, this is so exciting.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.246
Yeah, we were just wondering
if you could tell us

18:07.270 --> 18:09.150
a little bit more
about how it came to you.

18:09.190 --> 18:12.270
Well, it all goes back
to my first birthday.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.280
My nanny said
I was a very perceptive child,

18:14.320 --> 18:16.610
but I thought
she was just being obdurate.

18:16.650 --> 18:19.950
Well, imagine my surprise
when, only six years later,

18:19.990 --> 18:22.330
I'm graduating from Tisch.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.580
(door shuts)

18:41.800 --> 18:45.270
(beeping, trilling)

18:50.480 --> 18:52.730
VANESSA:
I'm in.

18:53.770 --> 18:55.280
(chuckles softly)

19:05.080 --> 19:09.080
I'm not seeing anything
but standard actor deals.

19:10.750 --> 19:13.170
JC, are you hearing me?

19:13.210 --> 19:16.210
(typing rapidly)

19:16.260 --> 19:19.130
- (buzzing, rhythmic beeping)
- Shit.

19:19.170 --> 19:22.050
There must be
a secondary security protocol.

19:32.270 --> 19:33.400
(chirping)

19:49.080 --> 19:51.250
(beep, trilling)

19:51.290 --> 19:52.830
(whooshing)

19:52.880 --> 19:54.476
FEMALE VOICE: Director
authorization recognized.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.880
Security protocols engaged.

19:59.210 --> 20:01.220
Okay, we're getting warmer.

20:01.260 --> 20:04.930
Another server just popped up...
but it's offline.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.310
Do you see anything else?

20:15.980 --> 20:17.400
(beep)

20:17.440 --> 20:18.900
(whoosh)

20:18.940 --> 20:21.030
(loud clacking)

20:21.070 --> 20:23.360
JC?

20:23.410 --> 20:25.870
What's going on?

20:25.910 --> 20:28.330
Do you have something?

20:28.370 --> 20:30.790
FEMALE VOICE:
Room secured.

20:40.210 --> 20:41.840
(beep, click)

20:41.880 --> 20:44.260
(whooshing)

20:49.060 --> 20:51.270
VANESSA:
Where are you?

20:51.310 --> 20:54.310
Some kind of hallway.

20:54.350 --> 20:55.940
(clack, whoosh)

20:55.980 --> 20:58.360
(door closes)

21:01.030 --> 21:02.490
(computer chirping)

21:02.530 --> 21:04.280
I'm looking at the blueprints.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.660
There's no hallway.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.740
Trust me.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.200
It's here.

21:17.790 --> 21:20.170
VANESSA:
Where does it lead?

21:20.210 --> 21:21.840
A door.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.800
FEMALE VOICE: Please provide
voice identification.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.220
JEAN-CLAUDE:
Voice recognition.

21:26.260 --> 21:29.220
VANESSA:
I can't hack that.

21:29.260 --> 21:31.640
No, but I can.

21:34.770 --> 21:36.400
(beep)

21:36.440 --> 21:39.440
FEMALE PHONE VOICE:
You have one saved message.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.280
- Is that...?
- First saved message.

21:41.320 --> 21:42.780
I-I thought you said

21:42.820 --> 21:44.860
you threw away your phone
back in Bulgaria.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.780
Jean-Claude... it's Jane...

21:47.820 --> 21:50.950
calling from the set
of the movie you just ruined.

21:50.990 --> 21:53.620
I'm guessing you've tucked
your tail between your legs

21:53.660 --> 21:56.120
and crawled back into
whatever hole you vanish into

21:56.170 --> 21:58.830
every single time
things don't go your way.

21:58.880 --> 22:03.010
So I wanted to hit you with
some truth while you're there.

22:03.050 --> 22:06.340
You... can't... hide,

22:06.380 --> 22:11.600
because the thing you're trying
to run from... it's inside you.

22:11.640 --> 22:16.140
You will never escape it, so...

22:16.190 --> 22:17.480
(beeping)

22:17.520 --> 22:19.610
FEMALE VOICE:
Analyzing voice sample.

22:20.860 --> 22:23.190
Did it work?

22:23.230 --> 22:25.860
(trilling)

22:25.900 --> 22:28.660
- Yeah. -FEMALE VOICE:
Identification accepted.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.660
User logged in.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.580
FEMALE VOICE:
Server online.

22:32.620 --> 22:35.250
Goddamn jackpot!

22:35.290 --> 22:38.870
I don't know what you did,
but that server just opened up.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.380
FEMALE VOICE:
Welcome, Jane Hardy.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.510
(quiet computer chirps)

22:44.550 --> 22:46.130
VANESSA:
JC?

22:47.170 --> 22:48.590
JC?

22:52.680 --> 22:55.350
MAN: I just got off the phone
with Shanghai.

22:55.390 --> 22:59.100
They think
we're undercapitalized in...

23:00.940 --> 23:03.730
China.

23:03.770 --> 23:05.280
Mr. Van Damme.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.780
(man chuckles)

23:07.820 --> 23:10.200
What an honor.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.870
(computer trilling)

23:12.910 --> 23:15.790
Who are you?

23:15.830 --> 23:18.540
Well, I guess you could say

23:18.580 --> 23:22.000
I am the face...
behind the curtain.

23:23.630 --> 23:26.000
Morris?

23:26.050 --> 23:30.130
I thought
you were a... a rumor.

23:30.180 --> 23:32.010
A legend.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.640
Hmm.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.810
Many could say the same
about you, yeah?

23:35.850 --> 23:37.270
(chuckles)

23:37.310 --> 23:39.810
(quiet,
rhythmic computer chirps)

23:39.850 --> 23:42.270
(gasps)

23:44.570 --> 23:47.070
JC, I found something.

23:49.070 --> 23:51.570
You weren't the only operative
on the Dragan job.

23:51.610 --> 23:53.280
I dream big.

23:59.710 --> 24:02.210
Krisztina... she works for you.

24:03.460 --> 24:06.300
(inhales sharply)
The best

24:06.340 --> 24:08.710
of our new generation
of operatives.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.800
As dangerous
as she is beautiful.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.390
So you plant her inside,

24:13.430 --> 24:15.350
and she collects
all the details

24:15.390 --> 24:17.010
on Dragan's organization.

24:18.270 --> 24:20.350
Why?

24:22.810 --> 24:25.440
There was no client.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.150
This was an internal operation.

24:28.190 --> 24:32.820
You wanted
to control Dragan's business.

24:32.860 --> 24:34.410
(computer chirps)

24:34.450 --> 24:35.990
JC, we got what we need.

24:36.030 --> 24:37.410
I'm copying it now.

24:37.450 --> 24:38.740
Get the fuck out of there.

24:38.790 --> 24:40.290
(computer trilling)

24:40.330 --> 24:41.790
Hmm.

24:41.830 --> 24:43.540
(chuckling)

24:43.580 --> 24:45.830
Of course
we wanted Dragan's business.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.630
This is the way of the world,
Jean-Claude,

24:49.670 --> 24:51.420
or haven't you heard?

24:51.470 --> 24:52.880
Why settle for ten percent

24:52.930 --> 24:54.970
when you can own
the whole damn thing?!

24:55.010 --> 24:58.430
That's why WME bought the UFC.

24:58.470 --> 25:01.430
And cage fighting
is chump change

25:01.480 --> 25:03.850
compared to the drug business.

25:03.890 --> 25:06.480
Highest margins in the world.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.860
You turned this place
into a drug cartel?

25:08.900 --> 25:11.440
You say that
as if it's any less honorable

25:11.490 --> 25:13.530
than running a talent agency.

25:13.570 --> 25:16.370
You used me.

25:16.410 --> 25:18.530
You used Jane.

25:18.580 --> 25:20.410
"You use-ed me,
you use-ed Jane."

25:20.450 --> 25:22.410
(laughs)

25:22.450 --> 25:24.000
You didn't know, huh?

25:24.040 --> 25:25.500
You really didn't know?

25:25.540 --> 25:27.710
(Morris laughs)

25:27.750 --> 25:31.630
This is all her idea, doofy!

25:31.670 --> 25:33.720
You really didn't know?

25:33.760 --> 25:36.590
(chuckling):
Oh, my God.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.010
Honestly, whenever I think

25:39.050 --> 25:41.930
an actor can't get
more self-absorbed,

25:41.970 --> 25:46.690
more blind to the world
around them, more stupid...

25:46.730 --> 25:48.690
(grunting)

25:51.940 --> 25:54.360
(alarm beeping)

25:59.160 --> 26:00.950
Fuck.

26:00.990 --> 26:03.540
We got to move. Now!

26:03.580 --> 26:05.580
(elevator bell dings)

26:09.840 --> 26:12.630
(garbled radio transmission)

26:37.610 --> 26:39.610
(sighs)

26:45.450 --> 26:48.370
(chuckles softly)

26:51.250 --> 26:52.590
- Jean-Claude.
- Jane.

26:52.630 --> 26:54.050
Aw.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.960
(Jean-Claude sighs)

26:56.010 --> 26:57.630
(Jane chuckles softly)

26:57.670 --> 26:59.180
I was just leaving.

26:59.220 --> 27:02.300
What? Before we have a chance
to talk?

27:02.350 --> 27:08.310
Mm. Why don't you come upstairs?

27:08.350 --> 27:10.020
Maybe another time.

27:10.060 --> 27:13.860
Are you sure you have to go?

27:13.900 --> 27:16.650
I'm sure.

27:19.990 --> 27:22.660
JC.

27:22.700 --> 27:26.200
It's cold out there.

27:27.910 --> 27:29.830
(sighs)

27:29.870 --> 27:34.250
Sometimes it's good
to be in the cold.

27:56.230 --> 27:58.190
- (sighs)
- Where are we going?

27:58.240 --> 28:00.860
I know a place
no one will ever come looking.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.490
Where?

28:02.530 --> 28:05.990
When you have nowhere to run,
you must run to nowhere.

28:06.030 --> 28:08.370
(engine revving)

28:08.410 --> 28:10.790
