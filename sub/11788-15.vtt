00:06.300 --> 00:07.369
Christian Troy: LOOKS LIKE A

00:07.370 --> 00:09.565
BASAL CELL CARCINOMA. NOTHING TO

00:09.570 --> 00:11.401
WORRY ABOUT. I CAN TAKE IT OFF

00:11.410 --> 00:12.502
WITH A LOCAL RIGHT HERE IN THE

00:12.510 --> 00:14.171
OFFICE, MRS. CAMDEN.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.171
Miss Camden: OH, THAT'S MISS

00:16.180 --> 00:18.705
CAMDEN. MY DIVORCE WAS FINAL 3

00:18.710 --> 00:22.214
WEEKS AGO.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.289
Christian: I'M SORRY TO HEAR

00:23.290 --> 00:26.714
THAT. I'M ALSO SORRY TO SAY THAT

00:26.720 --> 00:28.153
YOU'LL HAVE TO STOP THE NUDE

00:28.160 --> 00:29.229
SUNBATHING.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.653
Miss Camden: NOPE. TAN LINES ARE

00:31.660 --> 00:33.150
FOR STRIPPERS AND GERMAN

00:33.160 --> 00:35.458
TOURISTS.

00:35.460 --> 00:36.529
Christian: THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO

00:36.530 --> 00:37.667
FIND SOMEONE TO COVER THAT 3

00:37.670 --> 00:39.729
SPINNING CLASSES A WEEK REAR END

00:39.740 --> 00:42.459

00:42.470 --> 00:44.438
Camden: MMM. AND HOW DO YOU

00:44.440 --> 00:46.101
SUPPOSE I'LL EVER FIND SOMEONE

00:46.110 --> 00:49.568
TO PERFORM THAT THAN KLESS TASK.

00:49.580 --> 00:53.243
* GET BACK, HYPE, LOVE, LUST,

00:53.250 --> 00:53.841
YOU KNOW I LIKE TO DO IT

00:53.850 --> 00:54.748
WHEN YOU TREAT ME LIKE THAT,

00:54.750 --> 00:55.569
GIRL, I DIDN'T KNOW

00:55.580 --> 00:56.615
YOU COULD GET DOWN LIKE THAT,

00:56.620 --> 00:57.518
TELL ME HOW TO BOOGIE,

00:57.520 --> 00:58.487
SHAKE YOUR ASS LIKE THAT,

00:58.490 --> 00:59.354
GIRL, I DIDN'T KNOW

00:59.360 --> 01:00.384
YOU COULD GET DOWN LIKE THAT,

01:00.390 --> 01:01.357
YOU KNOW I LIKE TO BOOGIE

01:01.360 --> 01:02.327
WHEN YOU SEE ME LIKE THAT,

01:02.330 --> 01:03.228
GIRL, I DIDN'T KNOW

01:03.230 --> 01:04.288
YOU COULD GET DOWN LIKE THAT,

01:04.290 --> 01:05.154
TELL ME HOW TO BOOGIE,

01:05.160 --> 01:06.149
SHAKE YOUR ASS LIKE THAT,

01:06.160 --> 01:06.819
GIRL, I DIDN'T KNOW

01:06.830 --> 01:11.199
YOU COULD GET DOWN LIKE THAT *

01:11.200 --> 01:12.895
Christian: SO, HOW'S NEXT

01:12.900 --> 01:15.232
TUESDAY FOR YOU, MISS CAMDEN?

01:15.240 --> 01:16.332
Miss Camden: MMM. ITHINK I CAN

01:16.340 --> 01:18.638
FIT YOU IN.

01:26.580 --> 01:29.583
Gina: HEY, ASSHOLE.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.718
Christian: YOU'RE LIKE HERPES.

01:39.730 --> 01:40.651
EVERY TIME I FEEL LIKE I'M

01:40.660 --> 01:41.752
GETTING MY LIFE BACK, I HAVE A

01:41.760 --> 01:43.364
GINA OUTBREAK. WHAT DO YOU WANT

01:43.370 --> 01:44.359
FROM ME?

01:45.270 --> 01:46.464
TO LISTEN.

01:46.470 --> 01:47.391
Christian: JESUS. WHAT IS THIS,

01:47.400 --> 01:49.766
STEP 9? NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE

01:49.770 --> 01:51.260
ABOUT HOW YOU ACT ED, GINA. I

01:51.270 --> 01:54.899
DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

01:54.910 --> 01:56.878
Gina: I'M POSITIVE.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.769
Christian: POSITIVE ABOUT WHAT?

02:17.900 --> 02:19.299
Gina: I HAD A FUNGUS IN MY

02:19.300 --> 02:20.790
MOUTH. THE DOCTOR AT THE CLINIC

02:20.800 --> 02:26.670
SAID IT WAS CANDID SOMETHING.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.444
Christian: CANDIDA ALBICAN.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.578
Gina: YEAH. I GUESS THAT CAN BE

02:32.580 --> 02:34.548
AN EARLY SYMPTOM FOR H.I.V.,

02:34.550 --> 02:38.338
SO...THEY TESTED ME.

02:42.830 --> 02:43.683
Christian: WHEN DID YOU FIND

02:43.690 --> 02:44.987
OUT?

02:44.990 --> 02:48.448
Gina: A WEEK. 2 WEEKS, MAYBE.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.768
I'M ALL RIGHT, THOUGH. THEY GAVE

02:49.770 --> 02:50.691
SOME ANTIBIOTICS FOR THE FUNGUS,

02:50.700 --> 02:53.339
AND PUT ME ON THE COCKTAIL.

02:53.340 --> 02:56.559
[SIGHS]

02:56.570 --> 02:58.003
Christian: DO THEY KNOW WHEN YOU

02:58.010 --> 02:59.807
CONTRACT ED IT?

02:59.810 --> 03:04.543
Gina: THEY'RE NOT SURE. 6 MONTHS

03:04.550 --> 03:08.247
OR A YEAR. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,

03:08.250 --> 03:09.888
TO TELL YOU TO GET TESTED.

03:09.890 --> 03:10.811
Christian: JESUS, GINA, HOW

03:10.820 --> 03:11.718
COULD YOU BE SO IRRESPONSIBLE?

03:11.720 --> 03:12.618
Gina: I DON'T REMEMBER YOU

03:12.620 --> 03:13.518
STOPPING TO SHEATH YOUR SWORD,

03:13.520 --> 03:14.452
SIR SCREWS-A-LOT.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.415
Christian: I KNEW I SHOULD'VE

03:15.420 --> 03:16.250
DOUBLE-BAGGED IT WITH YOU!

03:16.260 --> 03:17.249
Gina: BUT YOU DIDN'T, ASSHOLE,

03:17.260 --> 03:18.852
DID YOU? BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT YOU

03:18.860 --> 03:19.952
WERE INVINCIBLE, AND YOU DIDN'T

03:19.960 --> 03:21.496
GIVE A SHIT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME

03:21.500 --> 03:22.489
OR ANY OF THE SLUTS THAT YOU'VE

03:22.500 --> 03:23.819
BEEN DUMPING YOUR LOAD INTO OVER

03:23.830 --> 03:25.889
THE PAST 2 DECADES.

03:25.900 --> 03:27.891
Christian: GET OUT. GET OUT OF

03:27.900 --> 03:29.458
MY LIFE.

03:29.470 --> 03:30.402
Gina: NO. NO, WAIT. CHRISTIAN,

03:30.410 --> 03:31.331
PLEASE. I NEED YOUR HELP TO GET

03:31.340 --> 03:33.900
A HOLD OF JAMES AND WILBUR.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.412
THE DOCTOR SAID I COULD'VE

03:44.420 --> 03:47.457
PASSED IT ON TO HIM IN UTERO.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.348
LOOK, I DON'T CARE ABOUT ME, BUT

03:49.360 --> 03:50.759
I NEED TO KNOW IF MY BABY'S

03:50.760 --> 03:53.024
SICK. I CAN DEAL WITH THE PILLS

03:53.030 --> 03:54.850
AND WITH THE PAIN, BUT I CANNOT

03:54.860 --> 03:55.849
STAND NOT KNOWING IF HE'S ALL

03:55.860 --> 03:57.396
RIGHT.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.389
Christian: I AM NOT HELPING YOU

03:58.400 --> 04:00.595
FIND SHIT. YOU'RE A POISON,

04:00.600 --> 04:02.864
GINA. EVERYTHING YOU TOUCH GETS

04:02.870 --> 04:04.360
INFECTED WITH YOUR OWN SPECIAL

04:04.370 --> 04:06.509
BRAND OF MISERY.

04:06.510 --> 04:08.535
Gina: THEY WAY I FIGURE IT,

04:08.540 --> 04:09.802
ASSHOLE, WE'RE A MATCH MADE IN

04:09.810 --> 04:13.769
HELL. YOU KNOW, THE ONLY

04:13.780 --> 04:17.409
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND ME, I

04:17.420 --> 04:18.842
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY

04:18.850 --> 04:22.684
MISTAKES.

04:50.990 --> 04:54.289
*AHH*

04:56.090 --> 05:03.519
* MAKE ME BEAUTIFUL *

05:05.500 --> 05:09.903
* MAKE ME

05:09.910 --> 05:13.107
A PERFECT SOUL,

05:13.110 --> 05:15.999
A PERFECT MIND,

05:16.010 --> 05:20.140
A PERFECT FACE,

05:20.150 --> 05:25.019
A PERFECT

05:25.020 --> 05:27.716
LIFE *

05:29.790 --> 05:30.722
Man: BEAUTY IS A CURSE ON THE

05:30.730 --> 05:33.722
WORLD. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID WHEN

05:33.730 --> 05:36.597
HE DID THIS TO ME. AND HE'S

05:36.600 --> 05:38.591
RIGHT. THE WAY I LOOK HAS BEEN

05:38.600 --> 05:41.034
MY CURSE MY WHOLE LIFE.

05:41.040 --> 05:41.938
Christian: YOU CAN'T TAKE

05:41.940 --> 05:42.907
RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT HAPPENED

05:42.910 --> 05:44.866
TO YOU, MR. ROURKE. YOU WERE

05:44.870 --> 05:45.905
BRUTALIZED BY A VERY DERANGED

05:45.910 --> 05:47.673
INDIVIDUAL.

05:47.680 --> 05:54.643
Rourke: MY LOOKS WERE HIS BAIT.

05:54.650 --> 05:57.687
I NEVER WANTED TO BE A MODEL. I

05:57.690 --> 05:59.089
WAS DISCOVERED AT THE BEACH

05:59.090 --> 06:00.409
CELEBRATING AN "A" IN LEGAL

06:00.420 --> 06:01.819
ETHICS. A PHOTOGRAPHER CAME UP

06:01.820 --> 06:03.151
TO ME, TOOK A FEW PICTURES, AND

06:03.160 --> 06:05.151
A MONTH LATER I'M SKIPPING THE

06:05.160 --> 06:06.696
BAR EXAM TO BE ON THE COVER OF

06:06.700 --> 06:08.918
THE J. CREW CATALOG.

06:08.930 --> 06:09.897
Sean: SOUNDS LIKE A DREAM COME

06:09.900 --> 06:11.891
TRUE.

06:24.210 --> 06:29.113
MAY I? I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU

06:29.120 --> 06:31.441
MUST BE FEELING HOPELESS RIGHT

06:31.450 --> 06:33.554
NOW, BUT HAVE YOU SEEN NAOMI

06:33.560 --> 06:34.982
GAINS?

06:34.990 --> 06:36.526
Rourke: SHE WAS ONE OF THE

06:36.530 --> 06:38.623
CARVER'S FIRST, RIGHT?

06:38.630 --> 06:39.927
Sean: YES. WE DID HER CORRECTIVE

06:39.930 --> 06:41.818
SURGERY. SHE JUST BOOKED THE

06:41.830 --> 06:43.764
COVER OF SELF. THERE'S NO REASON

06:43.770 --> 06:45.089
TO THINK YOUR SURGERY WON'T BE

06:45.100 --> 06:46.897
AS SUCCESSFUL AS HERS. WE'LL

06:46.900 --> 06:47.992
USE SOME MUSCULATURE FROM YOUR

06:48.000 --> 06:49.558
INNER THIGHS TO REPAIR THE NERVE

06:49.570 --> 06:51.037
DAMAGE AND COVER THE SCARRING.

06:51.040 --> 06:56.171
Rourke: NOT ALL OF IT. LEAVE

06:56.180 --> 06:57.477
SOME OF THE CUT ON THE RIGHT

06:57.480 --> 06:59.744
SIDE.

06:59.750 --> 07:00.876
Sean: THE MUSCLE LOSS FROM YOUR

07:00.880 --> 07:02.142
LEGS WON'T BE NOTICEABLE IF

07:02.150 --> 07:03.139
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED

07:03.150 --> 07:03.889
ABOUT.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.882
Rourke: LOOK, I HAVE A

07:06.890 --> 07:08.710
RESPONSIBILITY TO MYSELF TO BE

07:08.720 --> 07:09.880
MORE THAN SOME 2-DIMENSIONAL

07:09.890 --> 07:11.027
IMAGE IN SOME MEN'S FITNESS

07:11.030 --> 07:17.765
MAGAZINE. OK?

07:17.770 --> 07:18.964
Christian: DID YOU SUSTAIN ANY

07:18.970 --> 07:20.130
OTHER INJURIES BESIDES THE CUTS

07:20.140 --> 07:27.171
TO YOUR FACE?

07:27.180 --> 07:29.171
Rourke: THIS IS ALL COVERED

07:29.180 --> 07:30.772
UNDER THE DOCTOR/PATIENT

07:30.780 --> 07:33.544
CONFIDENTIALITY, RIGHT?

07:33.550 --> 07:40.956
Christian: YES.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.848
Rourke: I'VE GOT A MAXI PAD

07:42.860 --> 07:43.929
SHOVED DOWN THE BACK OF MY

07:43.930 --> 07:55.592
PANTS. HE RAPED ME. I'VE BEEN

07:55.600 --> 07:56.703
SHITI'ING RAZOR BLADES FOR A

07:56.710 --> 08:01.773
WEEK. I CAN BENCH 275 POUNDS,

08:01.780 --> 08:03.008
I'M A GODDAMN BLACKBELT IN

08:03.010 --> 08:04.602
KEMPO, BUT I COULDN'T KEEP THE

08:04.610 --> 08:07.818
SON OF A BITCH--

08:07.820 --> 08:09.879
Sean: HE OVERPOWERED YOU?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.846
Rourke: HE DRUGGED ME. HE SHOT

08:11.850 --> 08:13.784
ME UP WITH SOMETHING. I COULDN'T

08:13.790 --> 08:16.850
MOVE, I COULDN'T TALK.

08:16.860 --> 08:17.986
Christian: WE CAN REPAIR THE

08:17.990 --> 08:19.082
DAMAGE TO YOUR RECTUM AT THE

08:19.090 --> 08:22.560
SAME TIME WE WORK ON YOUR FACE.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.323
UNTIL THEN I'LL PRESCRIBE SOME

08:25.330 --> 08:27.890
STOOL SOFl'ENERS.

08:27.900 --> 08:31.233
Sean: I'M SORRY I HAVE TO ASK,

08:31.240 --> 08:32.571
BUT HAVE YOU HAD YOURSELF TESTED

08:32.580 --> 08:33.706
FOR H.I.V.?

08:33.710 --> 08:35.701
Rourke: NO NEED TO. ASSHOLE HAD

08:35.710 --> 08:36.972
ENOUGH SELF-CONTROL TO USE A

08:38.610 --> 08:39.975
AVOID LEAVING ANY D.N.A.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.572
EVIDENCE. I THINK THE GUY JUST

08:41.580 --> 08:42.979
ASSUMED ALL MALE MODELS WERE

08:42.990 --> 08:44.582
GAY. HE WAS JUST PROTECTING HIS

08:44.590 --> 08:50.187
ASS. CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL

08:50.190 --> 08:52.852
NOWADAYS, RIGHT?

09:02.140 --> 09:05.234
Sean: WHAT'S THIS?

09:05.240 --> 09:06.798
Christian: JUST RUNNING SOME

09:06.810 --> 09:08.175
BLOOD WORK. I'VE BEEN FEELING A

09:08.180 --> 09:09.875
LITTLE WEAK LATELY. I THOUGHT I

09:09.880 --> 09:12.644
MIGHT HAVE A VITAMIN DEFICIENCY.

09:12.650 --> 09:13.639
Sean: MORE LIKE A SELF-CONTROL

09:13.650 --> 09:15.379
DEFICIENCY. YOU'RE NOT 20

09:15.380 --> 09:17.189
ANYMORE, PAL. THOSE ALL-NIGHTERS

09:17.190 --> 09:18.339
ARE CATCHING UP TO YOU. HERE,

09:18.350 --> 09:19.783
LET ME.

09:19.790 --> 09:22.884
Christian: DON'T.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.118
Sean: I WAS ALWAYS BETTER AT

09:24.130 --> 09:30.160
FINDING THE VEIN THEN YOU WERE.

09:30.170 --> 09:38.009
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

09:38.010 --> 09:39.363
Christian: GINA'S H.I.V.

09:39.370 --> 09:46.139
POSITIVE.

09:46.150 --> 09:52.658
Sean: YOU SLEPT WITH GINA, WHAT,

09:52.660 --> 09:54.787
3 TIMES? I ASSUME YOU NEVER

09:54.790 --> 09:57.258
ENGAGED IN ANY HIGH-RISK

09:57.260 --> 09:59.251
BEHAVIOR WITH HER. MULTIPLE

09:59.260 --> 10:03.822
PARTNERS, ANAL SEX.

10:03.830 --> 10:04.762
Christian: WOULDN'T GO BACK

10:04.770 --> 10:05.828
THERE WITH A MONKEY'S DICK.

10:05.830 --> 10:07.092
Sean: GOOD. THEN I'M SURE YOU'RE

10:07.100 --> 10:08.089
FINE. THE STATISTICAL

10:08.100 --> 10:09.089
PROBABILITY IF YOU

10:09.100 --> 10:11.660
CONTRACTED THE VIRUS FROM

10:11.670 --> 10:14.002
LOW-RISK HETEROSEXUAL ACTIVITY

10:14.010 --> 10:17.104
IS ACTUALLY VERY SMALL.

10:17.110 --> 10:18.179
Christian: IS THAT WHY YOU PUT

10:18.180 --> 10:21.775
GLOVES ON TO TAKE MY BLOOD?

10:21.780 --> 10:23.839
Sean: LOOK, EVEN IF YOU DO HAVE

10:23.850 --> 10:25.078
THE VIRUS, THIS ISN'T THE

10:25.090 --> 10:27.012
EIGHTIES ANYMORE. THE COCKTAIL'S

10:27.020 --> 10:28.681
BEEN WILDLY SUCCESSFUL IN

10:28.690 --> 10:30.328
SUPPRESSING SYMPTOMS. PEOPLE ARE

10:30.330 --> 10:32.127
LIVING FOR YEARS.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.028
Christian: SOME ARE. SOME

10:33.030 --> 10:35.453
AREN'T. THE MEDIA HAS JUST

10:35.460 --> 10:37.064
DECIDED THAT THE STORIES OF THE

10:37.070 --> 10:38.822
LIVING ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN

10:38.830 --> 10:41.196
THE STORIES OF THE DYING. NOBODY

10:41.200 --> 10:42.132
TALKS ABOUT THE SIDE-EFFECT S OF

10:42.140 --> 10:44.108
THE COCKTAIL. THE CHRONIC

10:44.110 --> 10:45.839
DIARRHEA, KIDNEY STONES, FAT

10:45.840 --> 10:48.104
REDISTRIBUTION.
