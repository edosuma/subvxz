00:57.666 --> 00:59.500
<i> Good morning, Miss Belmont.</i>

00:59.583 --> 01:00.916
<i>This is your wake-up call.</i>

01:01.000 --> 01:03.125
<i>-The temperature is 35 degrees.</i>
-Goodbye.

01:03.208 --> 01:05.000
<i>Would you like me</i>
<i>to send up your--</i>

02:20.750 --> 02:22.750
So, just say no.

02:22.833 --> 02:25.166
Tell your father you don't want the job.

02:25.250 --> 02:28.375
He flew me all the way up here
in his private jet for Christmas.

02:28.458 --> 02:30.583
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

02:31.166 --> 02:33.416
Wow. Good morning, Miss Belmont.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.166
I'm Terry Carver from Guest Services.
Your father has asked me

02:36.250 --> 02:38.291
to work as your personal assistant
while you're here.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.916
And this is your Glam Squad.

02:40.416 --> 02:41.375
Fine.

02:41.458 --> 02:44.000
It's just that I don't want to be
in the hotel business.

02:44.083 --> 02:46.000
Have you tried telling him that?

02:48.791 --> 02:50.333
Mm. Daddy wouldn't understand.

02:50.416 --> 02:53.125
As far as he's concerned,
this is the perfect career for me.

02:53.208 --> 02:56.250
<i>I'm just trying to imagine</i>
<i>what you'd have to wear.</i>

02:56.333 --> 02:58.333
<i>Not a name tag, I hope.</i>

03:02.083 --> 03:05.416
-What exactly is the position?
-Vice President of Atmosphere.

03:05.916 --> 03:09.416
It's not even a real job. I think he just
made it up to give me something to do.

03:10.708 --> 03:13.083
And, you know,
it's hard enough for me as it is.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.875
When people look at me,
all they see is the spoiled daughter

03:15.958 --> 03:19.083
of Beauregard Belmont, the hotel magnate.
And I'm not spoiled!

03:19.750 --> 03:21.541
-Dress or slacks?

03:21.625 --> 03:23.666
I don't know. Is that pleather?

03:23.750 --> 03:24.708
Vegan leather.

03:25.291 --> 03:28.583
Oh, Tad, help me!
I need to make my own mark in the world.

03:28.666 --> 03:29.875
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

03:30.458 --> 03:31.875
How are your socials doing?

03:31.958 --> 03:35.416
Not good. I told you my accounts
were hacked by that girl, remember?

03:35.500 --> 03:37.916
Ugh! Right. Lucky you're dating
one of <i>Hype Magazine's</i>

03:38.000 --> 03:39.750
<i>top social influencers then.</i>

03:39.833 --> 03:41.708
So you remind me every day.

03:42.375 --> 03:44.458
<i>After lunch with your father,</i>

03:44.541 --> 03:47.708
why don't we hit the slopes
and snap a few ussies? Hmm?

03:47.791 --> 03:49.208
Post them on Instagram.

03:49.291 --> 03:51.500
I thought you wanted to keep
our relationship private.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.833
<i> Well, maybe it's time</i>
<i>we let the world in on it.</i>

03:53.916 --> 03:56.291
Talk about boosting your numbers.

03:56.375 --> 04:00.500
And it will prove to your father you could
have a career as an influencer too.

04:00.583 --> 04:03.791
Yeah, I just want people to remember me
for more than my last name.

04:03.875 --> 04:05.958
-You leave it to your Tad.

04:06.041 --> 04:07.208
Oh, trending down.

04:07.291 --> 04:09.583
Time for a selfie in a limo. See you soon.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.875
-Okay, I love-- Hello?

04:11.958 --> 04:13.208
Bad connection?

04:14.583 --> 04:17.416
Something like that.
Let's go with the Valenyagi.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.458
-Good choice.
-And a fabulous hat.

04:30.916 --> 04:31.750
Mr. Belmont!

04:32.833 --> 04:34.666
Hey! Glad I caught you.

04:36.583 --> 04:38.875
Hi. Hey. Uh, I'm Jake Russell. I own the--

04:38.958 --> 04:40.875
-The North Star Lodge.
-Yeah.

04:40.958 --> 04:43.208
Yeah, my secretary mentioned you called.

04:44.041 --> 04:46.333
-Fifteen times.
-Was it that many?

04:47.250 --> 04:48.375
So, what's the urgency?

04:48.458 --> 04:50.458
I just wanted
a minute of your time if I could.

04:50.541 --> 04:51.375
Sure.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.500
But you're gonna have to beat me
to the bottom of the run.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.750
-Seriously?
-Well, what do you think?

05:05.708 --> 05:07.625
Falling behind, boy!

05:13.041 --> 05:14.125
Better get moving!

05:31.958 --> 05:32.791
Good run.

05:32.875 --> 05:36.125
Yeah, I thought I had you there
for a minute, but you got me in the end.

05:36.208 --> 05:38.916
Let's go. You can talk while we walk.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.333
Thanks, Skyler.

05:44.416 --> 05:47.166
Wow, this place looks like
something out of SpaceX.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.250
Well, we try to stay ahead of the curve.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.000
-In here.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.750
Wow. Well, you have
an incredible place here, sir.

05:53.833 --> 05:56.291
It's, uh, truly a world-class
skiing destination.

05:57.291 --> 06:00.041
But, you know, not everybody
can afford world-class.

06:00.125 --> 06:03.708
Studies show that 70% of beginners
learn to ski at these smaller resorts.

06:03.791 --> 06:04.708
Like yours.

06:04.791 --> 06:07.708
Exactly. And then as they become
more accomplished and better skiers,

06:07.791 --> 06:10.166
then they move up
to the mega-resorts, like this one.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.083
And you think
that I should invest in your lodge

06:12.166 --> 06:14.541
in order to make sure
that this keeps happening, correct?

06:14.625 --> 06:15.791
Uh, more or less, yeah.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.583
Oh, Skyler. Cocoa?

06:18.625 --> 06:20.416
-Um, sure.
-Two please.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.625
Of course, Mr. Belmont.

06:21.708 --> 06:24.083
But I have the numbers here
for a cost-effective upgrade,

06:24.166 --> 06:27.750
a high-speed lift, you know,
building on a spa with a hot tub, sauna--

06:27.833 --> 06:31.625
Mr. Russell, I wish I could help you,
but I have my own investors to answer to.

06:31.708 --> 06:34.000
-I'm sure you understand. Thank you, dear.
-Well--

06:34.833 --> 06:36.041
Here you go. On the house.

06:36.125 --> 06:38.333
-And anything else he may need today.
-Of course.

06:38.416 --> 06:40.541
If you'll excuse me, I gotta run.

06:40.625 --> 06:44.708
Oh, and, uh, pretty classy out there
letting me win.

06:45.666 --> 06:46.500
Well done.

06:49.875 --> 06:53.250
<i> This is security. Alert the staff.</i>
<i>Miss Belmont is on the move.</i>

07:07.833 --> 07:09.041
<i> So, did he bite?</i>

07:09.125 --> 07:11.083
-No, he did not go for it.
-<i>Ah, bummer.</i>

07:11.166 --> 07:13.833
-Well, yeah. It was a long shot anyways.
-<i>Sorry, man.</i>

07:13.916 --> 07:16.291
-Yeah. See you back at the lodge.
-<i>Okay. See you soon.</i>

07:16.375 --> 07:18.750
Okay. Well, I'm in the lobby.
I don't see you.

07:18.833 --> 07:20.208
Well, I'm in the lobby,

07:20.291 --> 07:22.791
and let's be honest,
I'm pretty hard to miss.

07:23.416 --> 07:27.333
Look, I'm by a tapestry
that goes really well with my jacket.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.750
Excuse me.

07:30.375 --> 07:32.375
Now I'm in the lounge by the fireplace.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.125
-Oh, hey!
-Ah!

07:34.208 --> 07:35.541
-Oh!
-I'm wearing Valenyagi--

07:35.625 --> 07:37.500
-Oh, my--
-Oh, my God!

07:38.625 --> 07:41.000
I am so sorry. I didn't see you there.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.625
My Valenyagi!

07:42.708 --> 07:45.458
Oh, I'd happily pay for your dry cleaning,
or get some club soda…

07:45.541 --> 07:46.583
What happened, sweetie?

07:46.666 --> 07:48.833
-Oh, no!

07:48.916 --> 07:51.541
-Not the Valenyagi!

07:52.291 --> 07:53.708
-Oh! You're making it worse.
-Oh!

07:54.208 --> 07:56.166
-He ran right into me.
-It was an accident!

07:56.250 --> 07:58.541
You know, I came around the corner,
she was coming around,

07:58.625 --> 08:01.375
-and we just, wham, a chocolate thing.
-Is everything all right?

08:01.458 --> 08:03.500
-I'm a little flustered, but thank you.
-Tad!

08:03.583 --> 08:06.750
Oh, but this local yokel
just body slammed my girlfriend

08:06.833 --> 08:08.666
and ruined her haute couture onesie.

08:08.750 --> 08:13.625
-Again, I'm so sorry. It was an accident.
-Look, mate. Just go, all right? Just go.

08:14.208 --> 08:15.083
That way.

08:15.791 --> 08:17.458
Yeah. Yeah. Easy with the finger.

08:21.833 --> 08:25.500
Would mademoiselle care for the artisanal,
house-smoked bacon on her wedge salad?

08:25.583 --> 08:27.458
No, thank you. I don't do bacon.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.041
Very well.

08:33.666 --> 08:37.875
So, Ted, how is this online
internet business thing of yours going?

08:37.958 --> 08:41.416
It's Tad, Daddy.
And it's not a business thing.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.291
Tad's an influencer.
Millions of people follow him.

08:44.375 --> 08:45.750
Basically, you're a salesman.

08:47.041 --> 08:49.208
So how long have you two
been seeing each other now?

08:49.291 --> 08:50.916
Almost a year, Mr. Belmont.

08:51.666 --> 08:53.583
I think it's time you call him Beauregard.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.000
Right, Daddy?

08:55.083 --> 08:57.583
Oh! Okay.

08:57.666 --> 08:59.416
Anyway, Beau.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.500
You know how it is. One day…

09:04.000 --> 09:04.916
there she is.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.458
In the coffee shop of life.

09:08.791 --> 09:10.583
Sierra is a venti.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.708
Trending!

09:20.416 --> 09:21.250
Oh!

09:52.291 --> 09:53.125
Hi.

09:55.416 --> 09:58.000
-Hi, Jake.
-Hi, how's it going? Hey, buddy.

10:01.916 --> 10:03.000
Oh, come on.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.166
-Everything all right?
-Hey, Jake.

10:05.666 --> 10:07.666
Trying to get this one going,
but it's not happening.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.208
Okay. Yeah, just leave it
in the shed, and I'll get to it later.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.125
You got it.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.416
Hey! Where you guys going?

10:16.500 --> 10:20.125
Dad! The Christmas Wish Tree, remember?
Mom took us every year.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.333
-That's right.
-And now it's Grandma's job.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.875
Jake! Why don't you come with us?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.458
Well, as fun as that sounds,

10:27.541 --> 10:30.500
I have guests that want a sleigh ride,
so I'll take a snow check this time.

10:30.583 --> 10:34.000
But would you do me a favor? Would you
put in a good word with Santa for me?

10:34.083 --> 10:35.458
I need all the help I can get.

10:35.541 --> 10:37.833
I take it things didn't go well?

10:37.916 --> 10:39.416
Belmont was literally the last resort.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.500
If the rest of the season's this way,
I don't think--

10:41.583 --> 10:43.208
We just need a little patience.

10:43.291 --> 10:44.833
What we need is a miracle.

10:45.416 --> 10:48.708
Haven't you heard, Dad?
Christmas is a time for miracles.

10:48.791 --> 10:50.166
-Right, Grandma?
-That's right.

10:50.250 --> 10:51.625
Well, I love your optimism.

10:53.041 --> 10:55.000
All right. Yeah.
Bring me back something good.

11:52.333 --> 11:55.708
Yeah. I'm ready to leave for the airport.
Could you have my car brought around?

11:55.791 --> 11:58.000
-<i>Yes, Mr. Belmont.</i>
-Oh, good. You're still here.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.666
-Oh, hi!
-I didn't wanna miss you before you left.

12:00.750 --> 12:02.250
Well, I'll be back by the weekend.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.500
We will get you set up in your new office.

12:04.583 --> 12:06.583
I was thinking the one next to mine
if that's okay?

12:06.666 --> 12:09.375
Oh, Daddy. About the job…

12:10.000 --> 12:11.166
Yeah?

12:11.250 --> 12:12.583
Well, it's just that…

12:14.583 --> 12:16.166
I just don't wanna disappoint you.

12:16.250 --> 12:19.208
I don't think
you could do that, honey.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.583
Oh, I haven't seen this in a while.

12:25.083 --> 12:26.875
Your mother gave me that in Gstaad.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.500
She said
that the little girl reminded her of you.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.458
I'm surprised you remember.

12:36.583 --> 12:38.250
You were only five when she…

12:38.333 --> 12:40.708
I remember her perfume and her laugh.

12:41.791 --> 12:43.583
How she used to brush my hair.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.666
This hotel reminds me
so much of her.

12:48.875 --> 12:49.875
I still miss her.

12:52.666 --> 12:53.500
Me too.

12:58.833 --> 13:00.458
I promised your mother
I'd take care of you.

13:00.541 --> 13:01.416
You have.

13:01.916 --> 13:04.291
I mean, you've given me
everything I've ever wanted.

13:04.875 --> 13:05.708
Okay.

13:07.291 --> 13:09.708
Well, honey, I'll be back
by Christmas Eve.

13:09.791 --> 13:10.708
Okay.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.500
Have a safe flight.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.875
And don't worry about me.

13:13.958 --> 13:15.625
I'll be in very good hands.

13:15.708 --> 13:16.958
I'll be with Tad.

13:19.083 --> 13:20.541
-Yes, sir!

13:21.375 --> 13:23.208
-Look out! Coming through!

13:23.291 --> 13:25.708
-Hello, move! Move!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:28.375 --> 13:30.750
Now, I don't want to be disturbed
when I'm with Tad.

13:30.833 --> 13:32.458
If I need anything, I'll text you.

13:32.541 --> 13:35.125
Of course. When would you like
dinner sent up to your suite?

13:35.208 --> 13:37.583
Terry, I said, "Do not disturb."

13:38.791 --> 13:40.833
M'lady, your chariot awaits.

13:40.916 --> 13:42.916
I thought we were doing
the photo shoot here.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.958
Yeah, I've reserved a private gondola.

13:45.041 --> 13:48.291
Gondolas are for losers. Hop in.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.208
He's colorful.

13:57.958 --> 14:00.625
You know, Daddy would have loved
if we did the shoot here.

14:00.708 --> 14:02.541
Just you wait, angel cakes.

14:02.625 --> 14:03.916
-Just you wait.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.125
Ow!

14:13.083 --> 14:14.000
Oh, I love this song.

14:25.208 --> 14:26.375
A little pitchy, sweetie.

14:29.083 --> 14:30.750
Where's your holiday spirit?

14:59.291 --> 15:03.833
All right, lovebirds. I got hot cocoa
and fresh gingerbread cookies.

15:03.916 --> 15:05.541
-Are you two ready?
-Yeah, let's go!

15:05.625 --> 15:07.250
Is this thing safe?

15:07.333 --> 15:10.083
My friend,
this fine piece of craftsmanship

15:10.166 --> 15:12.083
has served the North Star for generations.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.750
Where's your sense of adventure?

15:14.791 --> 15:15.916
Couldn't be safer.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.500
Yo, something just fell off!

15:19.083 --> 15:20.833
-Cookie?
-Thank you.

15:20.916 --> 15:22.416
-It'll be fine.
-Have a good ride.

15:22.916 --> 15:23.750
Hiya!

15:37.291 --> 15:39.208
Where exactly are we going?

15:39.291 --> 15:41.750
I follow one of the top off-trail skiers
in the country,

15:41.833 --> 15:44.375
and he geotagged this secluded spot.

15:45.833 --> 15:47.083
It looks amazing.

15:48.125 --> 15:49.708
Heavy.

15:49.791 --> 15:50.625
Oh!

15:51.416 --> 15:53.708
You do know
I don't actually ski, don't you?

15:53.791 --> 15:55.458
No one needs to know that!

15:55.541 --> 15:58.208
It's all smoke and mirrors, baby.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.750
Do you know how to unhook the snowmobile,
by any chance?

16:01.833 --> 16:04.041
Do I look like
I know how to unhook a snowmobile?

16:04.958 --> 16:06.000
I'll figure it out.

16:08.875 --> 16:10.916
Okay, snowmobile, unhook.

16:11.541 --> 16:13.250
-What are you doing?
-Wait!

16:13.333 --> 16:16.041
Tad, it's not voice-activated,
for God's sake!

16:17.833 --> 16:18.791
Oh!

16:19.833 --> 16:21.125
-Oh!
-Tad!

16:22.125 --> 16:23.416
-Tad!

16:24.375 --> 16:25.458
-Ooh!

16:25.541 --> 16:27.375
Tad! I'm getting beaten back here!

16:27.458 --> 16:28.333
Ooh!

16:29.208 --> 16:30.875
Having fun?

16:30.958 --> 16:31.916
So much fun.

16:34.375 --> 16:37.875
No signal, okay.
Guess we just have to wing it.

16:37.958 --> 16:39.291
I think it's…

16:39.875 --> 16:40.708
this way.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.166
You don't know how to get back
to the car, do you?

16:43.250 --> 16:44.625
Yes, I do.

16:45.208 --> 16:46.875
-Hang on.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.208
-Tad!
-Oh!

16:52.750 --> 16:54.458
Look, it's the Wishing Tree!

16:58.125 --> 17:01.541
Hot roasted chestnuts, folks,
right here. Okay.

17:03.083 --> 17:04.541
We're next.

17:05.250 --> 17:08.916
And remember, you only get one wish,
so make it count.

17:14.875 --> 17:19.083
That's good, but could you try
to look a little more athletic?

17:19.166 --> 17:22.041
But, Tad, I wanna look… I wanna
look sporty, but not like I'm sweating.

17:24.083 --> 17:26.958
-There's just one thing missing.
-What?

17:27.041 --> 17:30.416
Well, I can't quite put my finger on it,

17:31.250 --> 17:32.416
but maybe you can?

17:37.041 --> 17:41.541
Sierra Belmont,
the last almost-a-year with you

17:41.625 --> 17:43.250
has been truly magical.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.958
And I want you to know that
whatever the future brings,

17:48.291 --> 17:49.666
I want it to bring us together.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.875
-Oh!
-Sierra Belmont…

17:54.250 --> 17:55.666
…will you marry me?

17:55.750 --> 17:56.625
Oh, Tad!

17:58.375 --> 18:00.833
Tad, it's too big, sweetie.

18:01.458 --> 18:02.625
We could have it resized.

18:02.708 --> 18:03.541
Oh.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.458
Let's make it official, shall we?

18:06.833 --> 18:11.583
Our first social media post
as an engaged couple!

18:18.333 --> 18:19.208
There.

18:19.291 --> 18:21.333
-I wish--
-Don't… Don't tell me.

18:21.416 --> 18:24.583
You have to keep it a secret,
or it won't come true.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.125
-You guys have a Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

18:27.208 --> 18:28.833
Okay.

18:30.458 --> 18:31.458
What was your wish?

18:31.958 --> 18:34.458
Um… Uh… I got my wish.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.541
When your mommy and daddy had you.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.000
Ah! I love you, Grandma.

18:40.083 --> 18:41.041
Mm.

18:41.875 --> 18:44.041
Okay. Let's put it up in that branch.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.375
-Ready?
-Yes.

18:47.916 --> 18:50.166
-There.
-Oh. Very good.

19:15.541 --> 19:17.208
-Hm? Oh.
-Oh!

19:18.958 --> 19:20.833
-Tad?
-Looks like the weather's changing.

19:20.916 --> 19:22.250
Take me back to the hotel.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.666
-Okay. Okay.
-Tad.

19:25.250 --> 19:26.250
Tad!

19:26.333 --> 19:27.583
Whoa! Oh!

19:29.250 --> 19:30.416
Hold on, Sierra!

19:31.166 --> 19:32.916
-I've got you!

19:33.625 --> 19:35.541
-I'm slipping!
-Hold on!

19:40.916 --> 19:41.875
Sierra!

19:43.541 --> 19:45.125
No!

19:45.208 --> 19:46.208
Oh my--

19:48.791 --> 19:49.833
Oh!

20:25.708 --> 20:26.666
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

20:27.166 --> 20:28.375
Hey, hang tight, guys.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.500
What is it?

20:35.375 --> 20:38.750
-Oh, it better not be a dead body.
-Stop it. You're freaking me out.

20:39.833 --> 20:41.000
Oh my God.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.500
Is it a dead body?

20:46.125 --> 20:47.666
Hey, miss, can you hear me?

20:52.041 --> 20:54.375
Hey, base camp, this is Jake.
I'm on the far side of Hoosier.

20:54.458 --> 20:57.916
We have a Code 3. Repeat, Code 3.
I need Ski Patrol immediately.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.541
-<i> You got it, Jake.</i>

21:07.750 --> 21:09.750
Oh! Uh… How is she?

21:09.833 --> 21:12.250
Physically, she's all right.
Minor concussion.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.333
But that's not the real problem.

21:14.416 --> 21:16.875
She says she doesn't remember anything
prior to the accident.

21:16.958 --> 21:17.875
Amnesia?

21:17.958 --> 21:19.416
Or something like it.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.750
Well, at least she's awake.
That's a good thing, right?

21:21.833 --> 21:23.958
Well, that depends
upon your point of view.

21:24.041 --> 21:25.666
-Ma'am, hold still.
-Stop!

21:25.750 --> 21:28.333
No, don't touch me!
Would you get your hands off of me?

21:28.416 --> 21:31.166
Look, I told you I'm perfectly fine, okay?

21:31.750 --> 21:32.708
Okay, all right.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.750
-It's okay. We'll try later.

21:34.833 --> 21:37.000
-Thank you, Gene. We'll take it from here.

21:37.583 --> 21:40.208
Finally, at last, someone with authority.

21:40.291 --> 21:43.000
Sheriff, could you please tell her
to let me out of here?

21:43.083 --> 21:45.083
Well, miss,
we'd love to be able to do that,

21:45.166 --> 21:47.458
but first we need to figure out
who you are.

21:47.541 --> 21:48.833
What do you mean who I am?

21:48.916 --> 21:50.333
I know who I am.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.083
My name is…

21:53.083 --> 21:54.250
My name is…

21:55.958 --> 21:57.125
My name is…

21:57.708 --> 22:00.083
Well, we checked your clothing
for any identification,

22:00.166 --> 22:01.250
but there was nothing.

22:01.333 --> 22:03.500
Oh! I mean, I did find this.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.750
Makeup.

22:05.583 --> 22:06.833
Where are my clothes?

22:06.916 --> 22:09.583
I'm afraid the ER team
had to cut you out of those.

22:09.666 --> 22:11.916
Hey, uh, what about fingerprints?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.500
We took those when we brought her in.

22:13.583 --> 22:17.166
They're not registered in our database,
which means she's never been arrested

22:17.250 --> 22:19.000
or possibly never even employed.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.291
So what are we supposed to do with her?

22:21.375 --> 22:24.541
Well, I could put her picture up
on our missing person website.

22:24.625 --> 22:26.291
But it is the holidays, you know.

22:26.375 --> 22:29.458
Until someone comes looking for her
or until she remembers something,

22:29.541 --> 22:30.958
there's not much I can do.

22:31.041 --> 22:33.541
Excuse me, <i>she </i>is right here in the room,

22:33.625 --> 22:35.791
and she is tired
of being treated like a prisoner

22:35.875 --> 22:37.916
just because
you all can't do your job, so…

22:38.500 --> 22:39.583
-Ow!
-Oh!

22:39.666 --> 22:41.166
-Oh, my head.
-Okay.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.083
Ow!

22:42.166 --> 22:43.291
Take it easy. Take it easy.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.583
-Look, miss.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.625
I wish there was more that I could do,

22:49.708 --> 22:53.000
but we have procedures to follow
when we're dealing with a Jane Doe.

22:53.583 --> 22:54.541
A Jane Doe?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.250
I am not a Jane Doe!

22:56.333 --> 22:58.250
Well, I don't know what else to call you.

22:58.333 --> 23:01.541
You've got no identity, no money,
and no place to go.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.000
I have a place. I mean, the lodge.

23:05.083 --> 23:08.416
I mean, we have some cancellations.
She could stay with us.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.333
And you are?

23:10.416 --> 23:12.791
This is Jake Russell.
He's the one who found you.

23:13.916 --> 23:15.750
Does he look familiar to you at all?

23:18.500 --> 23:21.208
No, he is definitely a stranger.

23:21.708 --> 23:24.958
And I'm not about to follow him
to some murder cabin in the woods.

23:25.041 --> 23:27.708
Jake owns the North Star Lodge.

23:27.791 --> 23:29.750
Oh, the North Star Lodge?

23:31.208 --> 23:33.875
Okay. Does it have room service?

23:33.958 --> 23:37.500
You know, it's actually more of, like,
a bed-and-breakfast type place.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.250
What kind of breakfast?

23:39.333 --> 23:42.458
On second thought,
I think she's probably better off here.

23:42.541 --> 23:43.500
No.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.041
Well…

23:45.541 --> 23:48.458
Actually, you know, reestablishing
a normal routine of activities

23:48.541 --> 23:49.791
might help jog your memory.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.708
It's up to you. Now, you can stay here,

23:52.791 --> 23:55.375
or you can take old Jake up on his offer.

24:03.916 --> 24:04.916
Brilliant!

24:05.000 --> 24:07.875
Just absolutely bloody brilliant!

24:08.458 --> 24:13.291
What kind of crap forest
doesn't have a cell tower? 

24:21.708 --> 24:23.875
Hello, this is Tad Fairchild.

24:25.250 --> 24:28.333
I've just survived a death-defying fall,

24:28.833 --> 24:31.750
and I'm currently stranded
in a remote glacial forest.

24:32.333 --> 24:34.041
This recording will be a testament

24:34.125 --> 24:37.250
to my brave fight for life
against all odds.

24:40.083 --> 24:41.125
Hm.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.791
But should anyone find my body…

24:43.958 --> 24:46.041
…please upload this vid--

24:59.958 --> 25:01.333
Where am I?

25:14.833 --> 25:17.000
All righty. Went through
the lost and found.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.708
Not sure if these will fit,
but they're better than scrubs.

25:19.791 --> 25:21.250
Guess they'll have to do for now.

25:21.958 --> 25:24.458
Ew. Are these used?

25:24.541 --> 25:26.000
Uh… Probably.

25:26.083 --> 25:29.416
But, you know, sometimes guests
leave things here by accident, so…

25:29.500 --> 25:31.500
Not sure this was left here by accident.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.250
Okey-dokey, your room is ready.

25:34.333 --> 25:37.083
Here are some fresh towels,
and there are clean sheets on the bed.

25:37.166 --> 25:39.291
Look, I appreciate everything
you guys are doing,

25:39.375 --> 25:42.458
but I'm not gonna be here for that long.
This is just temporary.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.583
Well, until then, you're stuck with us.

25:46.083 --> 25:47.541
-I'll show you the way.
-Okay.

25:48.041 --> 25:48.958
Oh.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.958
Ooh!

26:16.458 --> 26:17.625
-What happened?

26:17.708 --> 26:20.500
Hi. Uh… There was
a wild, hairy beast out there!

26:20.583 --> 26:21.958
Okay, I'll check it out.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.166
I think you're okay. They're gone.

26:28.416 --> 26:29.958
You know, we are out in the wilderness,

26:30.041 --> 26:32.500
so you're bound to have a few visitors
from time to time.

26:32.583 --> 26:34.333
Right. Well, they can stay out there.

26:35.208 --> 26:36.500
Yeah, I'll let them know.

26:41.291 --> 26:43.125
-What?
-Uh, nothing.

26:43.875 --> 26:45.083
Nice granny gown.

26:46.791 --> 26:48.375
Well, if that's a compliment…

26:49.375 --> 26:50.291
I'll take it.

26:51.666 --> 26:52.833
Good night.

27:28.666 --> 27:30.583
-Sanctuary!

27:34.250 --> 27:37.250
I thought I'd never see
another human being again.

27:38.833 --> 27:41.083
Look at you.

27:43.500 --> 27:46.166
You're beautiful.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.958
What's your name, savior?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.500
Ralph.

27:49.583 --> 27:50.583
Ralph?

27:51.250 --> 27:52.791
My phone battery's dead.

27:54.041 --> 27:56.750
I don't suppose you have a charger here
for the model 15, do you?

27:57.291 --> 27:59.625
Uh, no. Don't like cell phones.

27:59.708 --> 28:01.208
-Hm.
-Don't trust them.

28:02.500 --> 28:03.833
Want some coffee?

28:03.916 --> 28:05.666
Yes, please, Ralph. Huh!

28:05.750 --> 28:11.250
After my nightmarish ordeal,
that would be the nectar of the gods.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.458
Mm.

28:17.833 --> 28:20.250
Can I help get that lure out your face?

28:21.666 --> 28:22.541
What lure?

28:24.125 --> 28:26.166
The one stuck in your face.

28:27.791 --> 28:28.666
Oh, I see it.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.041
Uh-huh.

28:41.583 --> 28:43.333
It was just a dream.

28:52.083 --> 28:54.208
-What's wrong with this thing?

29:04.458 --> 29:05.291
-Hi!
-Hello!

29:05.375 --> 29:06.500
-Good morning!

29:06.583 --> 29:08.041
Good morning!

29:09.833 --> 29:11.041
It's not a dream.

29:13.333 --> 29:14.333
Who are you?

29:21.208 --> 29:22.208
Hello.

29:23.541 --> 29:24.833
Your room is a mess.

29:24.916 --> 29:27.500
Yeah, nobody's come to clean it yet.

29:29.041 --> 29:30.083
I'm Avy.

29:30.166 --> 29:32.916
You're the lady who doesn't know
who she is, right?

29:33.500 --> 29:34.916
I guess that's me.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.541
-My dad told me.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.250
Do you have anything
I could dry my hair with?

29:39.333 --> 29:41.083
-Of course. In my room.
-Thank you.

29:48.666 --> 29:51.000
So, what are we supposed to call you?

29:51.750 --> 29:55.041
Good question. I don't know.
Do you have any names you like?

29:55.875 --> 29:56.875
Well,

29:57.833 --> 29:59.250
You can have one of theirs.

30:00.250 --> 30:01.250
Oh.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.250
Come meet them.

30:04.291 --> 30:08.666
That's Frankie, that's Wallace,
that's Potter, and that's Sarah.

30:08.750 --> 30:09.958
Hmm.

30:10.041 --> 30:12.250
Sarah. I like that one.

30:12.333 --> 30:14.458
Okay. Sarah it is.

30:16.208 --> 30:17.916
Oh. Is this your mom?

30:21.958 --> 30:22.791
Yeah.

30:23.750 --> 30:25.666
She died almost two years ago.

30:26.666 --> 30:27.750
I'm so sorry.

30:29.625 --> 30:30.708
I miss her a lot.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.375
Sometimes…

30:34.208 --> 30:35.041
Hmm?

30:36.750 --> 30:39.291
Nothing. You'll think it's weird.

30:39.375 --> 30:43.041
Well, I don't even know who I am.
Nothing's weirder than that.

30:44.291 --> 30:45.125
Well…

30:46.791 --> 30:49.166
Sometimes I talk to her picture.

30:49.250 --> 30:52.750
I don't think that's weird at all.
I think that's beautiful.

30:58.750 --> 31:00.250
Hey, how are you feeling?

31:00.333 --> 31:01.666
Do you know me?

31:01.750 --> 31:04.458
-We met on the sleigh ride.
-You were unconscious the whole time.

31:04.541 --> 31:05.708
Oh.

31:05.791 --> 31:07.208
-Enjoy breakfast.
-Thank you.

31:07.291 --> 31:08.666
I was unconscious.

31:08.750 --> 31:10.416
Hey, everybody! This is Sarah!

31:11.000 --> 31:12.458
Oh, Sarah.

31:12.541 --> 31:13.958
We're trying it out.

31:14.041 --> 31:16.125
You've already met my dad.
This is my grandma.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.666
Yes. Alejandra.

31:17.750 --> 31:18.666
That's right.

31:19.416 --> 31:22.750
Well, Sarah, we just ran out
of pumpkin pancakes,

31:22.833 --> 31:25.500
but if you'd like,
I can make you some eggs.

31:25.583 --> 31:28.666
Oh, please, I'm perfectly capable
of making my own breakfast.

31:31.916 --> 31:33.250
It's broken.

31:33.333 --> 31:36.500
Yeah. No, you just gotta…
You gotta push it in and then twist it.

31:37.500 --> 31:38.625
Thank you.

31:40.333 --> 31:43.000
-Oh, this comes out fast.

31:43.708 --> 31:44.541
Egg?

31:44.625 --> 31:45.666
Thank you.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.458
-Oh!

31:48.041 --> 31:49.958
Well, you showed that egg who's boss.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.416
A little messy.

31:53.375 --> 31:56.041
You know what?
Um… Why don't you sit over there,

31:56.125 --> 31:59.125
and I will take care of all of this.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.458
Okay, good idea.

32:03.583 --> 32:06.125
-Hm. Bacon?
-I don't do bacon.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.833
But bacon is delicious.

32:08.916 --> 32:10.208
Have you ever tried it?

32:10.708 --> 32:12.125
I don't remember.

32:12.625 --> 32:14.875
Then how do you know
you don't do it?

32:14.958 --> 32:15.791
Huh.

32:20.333 --> 32:21.250
I like bacon.

32:24.666 --> 32:26.666
-Mm.

32:27.208 --> 32:28.458
What are these muffins?

32:28.541 --> 32:30.666
I don't think
she's from around here, dear.

32:30.750 --> 32:32.958
-What's your favorite one?
-Something about her…

32:33.041 --> 32:34.958
-Mm.

32:35.041 --> 32:36.750
I know-- I feel like I've met her before.

32:37.416 --> 32:38.291
Really?

32:46.791 --> 32:49.958
Well, she said
she didn't want to be disturbed.

32:50.041 --> 32:52.250
But that was almost 24 hours ago.

32:52.333 --> 32:53.333
Miss Belmont?

32:53.416 --> 32:56.416
This is hotel security.
May I come in? Hello?

33:00.291 --> 33:01.416
Miss Belmont?

33:01.500 --> 33:02.916
It's me, Terry.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.958
But she didn't sleep here last night.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.875
Are you sure? Maybe she made the bed?

33:08.958 --> 33:12.416
Miss Belmont make the bed?
Not in this lifetime.

33:18.500 --> 33:20.875
"Sierra, can't wait to take you away."

33:20.958 --> 33:22.208
"Love, Tad."

33:22.833 --> 33:25.250
Sounds like they planned
to go off someplace together.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.208
-But where?
-Don't touch me.

33:27.291 --> 33:28.250
Got it.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.000
Where am I?

33:43.375 --> 33:44.208
Huh?

33:44.875 --> 33:45.708
Ralph?

33:52.250 --> 33:53.083
No way.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.083
Ralph!

34:11.833 --> 34:12.750
Ralph!

34:15.375 --> 34:16.458
Morning!

34:16.541 --> 34:18.916
Thought I'd let you sleep in.
You looked all cozy.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.250
Is that your truck?

34:22.958 --> 34:23.833
Yeah.

34:23.916 --> 34:25.416
What's going on with it?

34:25.500 --> 34:28.291
-Dead as last night's roadkill.

34:28.375 --> 34:29.625
Horrible visual.

34:29.708 --> 34:31.833
We'll leave a note, head out on foot.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.708
It's just a couple days' hike
through the pass to get to the road.

34:35.791 --> 34:37.833
-Days?
-Depending on the weather.

34:38.500 --> 34:42.250
Hey, how about I whip us up
some fried fish for breakfast? Sound good?

34:42.333 --> 34:45.250
Oh, I don't eat fish. They are exotic pets
in my saltwater aquarium

34:45.333 --> 34:46.583
at my condo in Manhattan.

34:46.666 --> 34:48.416
Well, fine by me.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
-Get your own breakfast.

34:51.625 --> 34:54.708
-What am I supposed to do with this?
-Hurl it at a squirrel?

34:56.291 --> 34:58.500
No, it's all right.

34:59.541 --> 35:00.375
Thank you.

35:00.875 --> 35:02.125
Merry Christmas.

35:02.875 --> 35:04.125
Another cancellation.

35:04.625 --> 35:07.333
-You're kidding?
-They're going to an Airbnb instead.

35:07.416 --> 35:10.541
-Well, how do we compete with that?
-It's all going to work out.

35:10.625 --> 35:13.625
Well, I don't know how. Look at this.
We can't even afford a housekeeper.

35:13.708 --> 35:14.750
-I know.
-Hey.

35:15.375 --> 35:18.541
I was just wondering,
any calls regarding me?

35:18.625 --> 35:19.541
Afraid not.

35:20.083 --> 35:21.833
I just don't understand.

35:22.333 --> 35:24.500
I mean, surely someone is out there
looking for me.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.875
You haven't been able
to remember anything?

35:26.958 --> 35:30.666
No, but the doctor did say
that if I did normal things,

35:30.750 --> 35:32.000
my memory might come back.

35:32.833 --> 35:35.166
But I wonder what she meant
by "normal things."

35:42.875 --> 35:43.958
Doctor's orders.

35:53.958 --> 35:55.000
Good luck.

36:01.958 --> 36:04.250
-Oh!

36:08.333 --> 36:10.166
This sheet is evil!

36:10.750 --> 36:13.041
Have you ever actually made a bed, dear?

36:14.416 --> 36:15.333
I don't think so.

36:15.416 --> 36:17.166
Why don't you try something else?

36:17.250 --> 36:20.000
I'm telling you, man,
take the gondola up the hill, man…

36:24.541 --> 36:25.833
Do I just put these here?

36:29.666 --> 36:30.833
-Oh!

36:34.750 --> 36:35.583
Really?

36:41.500 --> 36:42.333
Oh no.

36:43.041 --> 36:44.708
Oh, please don't be stuck.

37:01.625 --> 37:02.666
I can do this.

37:22.583 --> 37:23.791
Are we there yet?

37:23.875 --> 37:26.208
Nope. Stick with me, buddy.

37:27.666 --> 37:29.250
I don't think I can make it!

37:29.916 --> 37:32.083
Ralph!

37:35.416 --> 37:36.416
Just leave me here.

37:38.875 --> 37:40.166
Save yourself.

37:40.250 --> 37:41.250
Hang in there.

37:42.416 --> 37:43.791
I gotcha, buddy.

37:46.458 --> 37:47.333
-Here.
-Oh.

37:49.041 --> 37:50.500
-Ooh!
-All right. Here.

37:52.083 --> 37:53.208
You're so strong.

37:53.291 --> 37:54.291
This'll do ya.

37:55.583 --> 37:56.958
-Oh!
-There we go.

37:59.375 --> 38:00.291
Ready?

38:01.416 --> 38:02.666
But what about you?

38:02.750 --> 38:05.958
Hey, don't you worry about me.
I got big feet.

38:06.041 --> 38:07.958
Come on. Here we go.

38:12.458 --> 38:13.958
Ow! Ow!

38:16.125 --> 38:16.958
Ow!

38:17.041 --> 38:18.500
Hey there. Are you okay?

38:18.583 --> 38:19.875
-It's stuck.
-Oh.

38:21.708 --> 38:22.833
Let me help you.

38:23.583 --> 38:24.500
Thank you.

38:30.541 --> 38:34.416
Sometimes you can't rush things.

38:34.500 --> 38:36.625
You just have to take your time.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.375
You know, my mom always said,

38:39.458 --> 38:42.416
"The worst tangles
will sort themselves out…"

38:42.500 --> 38:44.916
…if you just give them a little help.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.041
There you go.

38:48.541 --> 38:50.083
The tangles are all gone.

39:02.083 --> 39:03.416
You remember your mom?

39:05.333 --> 39:07.458
Yeah. I think I do.

39:13.791 --> 39:14.750
Avy?

39:15.375 --> 39:16.291
Oh!

39:17.458 --> 39:18.875
What happened here?

39:19.458 --> 39:21.166
-What is this?

39:21.250 --> 39:22.291
-Oh.
-It wasn't me, Dad.

39:22.375 --> 39:23.541
Look at this mess!

39:23.625 --> 39:24.666
I'm sorry.

39:25.750 --> 39:28.125
Great. This is the last thing
I need right now.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.500
-Oh.

39:41.583 --> 39:42.708
Hey there.

39:44.083 --> 39:45.083
Balthazar.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Nice to meet you.

39:49.083 --> 39:50.500
I'd introduce myself,

39:51.416 --> 39:52.958
but I have no idea who I am.

39:54.125 --> 39:56.541
I can tell you
I'm pretty much a useless human.

39:57.375 --> 39:58.833
I can't do anything right.

40:00.541 --> 40:02.958
You'd think I'd have
some sort of skill, wouldn't you?

40:07.083 --> 40:08.500
Thanks for your support.

40:09.833 --> 40:13.500
Now, let's see if I can manage
to fetch some wood.

40:15.041 --> 40:16.000
See you later.

40:40.375 --> 40:42.000
Oh.

40:46.708 --> 40:48.083
Whoa! Oh!

40:49.083 --> 40:50.250
-Oh.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.041
Gosh. Are you hurt?

40:55.125 --> 40:55.958
No.

40:56.791 --> 40:58.291
I… I'll get it. Uh…

40:59.791 --> 41:00.625
You all right?

41:02.791 --> 41:04.000
Yeah.

41:05.541 --> 41:06.375
Look, I'm…

41:07.541 --> 41:10.041
I didn't mean what I said earlier. It was…

41:12.916 --> 41:14.083
It's not just that.

41:15.125 --> 41:18.583
It's been almost two days,
and what? No one's found me yet?

41:19.583 --> 41:21.666
I'm like unclaimed luggage.

41:22.208 --> 41:23.750
Hey, come on. Don't say that.

41:23.833 --> 41:26.875
I… I bet you got family and friends
who are worried sick about you.

41:26.958 --> 41:30.250
I mean, they're probably out there
looking for you right now.

41:30.958 --> 41:31.958
You think?

41:32.041 --> 41:33.166
Of course.

41:33.250 --> 41:36.125
You know what? Why don't we go
to the Christmas Market downtown?

41:36.208 --> 41:38.541
Okay, it's a big street fair,
a lot of people there.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.541
You know, maybe somebody
will recognize you.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.041
I don't wanna be any more trouble.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.166
No, it's… it's really no trouble.

41:45.250 --> 41:47.500
Besides, Avy would love it.

41:47.583 --> 41:49.125
All right.

41:56.250 --> 41:58.333
Nah, that's… You can keep it.

41:59.958 --> 42:00.916
-Right.
-Yeah.

42:01.000 --> 42:01.875
Thanks.

42:12.916 --> 42:14.541
Wow, this is really pretty.

42:15.416 --> 42:16.666
Any of this ring a bell?

42:17.333 --> 42:21.000
No, nothing. I don't think
I've ever been here in my life.

42:23.375 --> 42:25.500
Come on! You guys are too slow!

42:27.083 --> 42:29.666
Avy gets pretty excited about Christmas.

42:33.208 --> 42:35.875
Wow, what a pretty sleigh.

42:36.750 --> 42:38.833
She takes after Carla.

42:38.916 --> 42:40.291
She was my wife.

42:40.375 --> 42:42.083
Yeah, Avy told me about her.

42:43.458 --> 42:44.541
I'm sorry.

42:44.625 --> 42:45.500
Thank you.

42:46.041 --> 42:48.291
It's been a rough couple of years.

42:48.375 --> 42:51.625
I mean, I didn't even think
we were gonna stay here after.

42:51.708 --> 42:52.875
But where would you go?

42:52.958 --> 42:55.208
I don't know, like,
maybe back to the city?

42:55.708 --> 42:57.916
I used to have a, uh… ski travel business.

42:58.833 --> 43:01.875
But the North Star's been
in Carla's family for three generations.

43:01.958 --> 43:03.791
Her father gave it to us
as a wedding gift,

43:03.875 --> 43:06.750
and I kind of just…
fell in love with the place.

43:08.375 --> 43:10.833
-I don't want to have to sell it, but…
-But?

43:10.916 --> 43:12.875
You know, people,
they… they like the new resorts,

43:12.958 --> 43:15.291
the flashy stuff,
all the bells and whistles.

43:15.791 --> 43:18.875
But I still think there's something
really special about the simple things.

43:18.958 --> 43:22.000
You know, like home-style meals,

43:23.083 --> 43:25.041
hot chocolate by the fireplace,

43:25.708 --> 43:26.875
a home away from home.

43:29.291 --> 43:30.208
I don't know.

43:31.750 --> 43:32.708
Maybe I'm wrong.

43:36.458 --> 43:37.458
Dad, Sarah.

43:38.458 --> 43:39.416
Look at this.

43:43.250 --> 43:44.708
Isn't it beautiful?

43:44.791 --> 43:48.041
You have very good taste in sleighs,
young lady.

43:48.541 --> 43:51.583
This one's a beauty, all handmade.

43:51.666 --> 43:53.625
Rides like the wind.

43:53.708 --> 43:55.708
Well, that's a fantastic-looking sleigh.

43:57.750 --> 44:00.291
Um… But I am afraid
it is out of our league.

44:00.375 --> 44:04.208
Well, I'm here watching this stall
for a friend.

44:04.291 --> 44:08.666
So, if you see anything else
that you'd like, well… Oh!

44:14.041 --> 44:14.875
Look at this.

44:17.333 --> 44:18.875
Oh, it's beautiful.

44:27.083 --> 44:28.083
You okay?

44:28.791 --> 44:30.000
Yeah. Uh…

44:31.583 --> 44:32.916
You know what? We'll take it.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.208
How wonderful.

44:35.958 --> 44:38.000
-For you.
-No, Jake, I couldn't.

44:38.083 --> 44:39.958
Oh, come on. It's an early Christmas gift.

44:40.666 --> 44:41.708
Thank you.

44:45.083 --> 44:45.916
There you go.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.500
Merry Christmas.

44:47.583 --> 44:49.041
Merry Christmas.

44:49.125 --> 44:50.041
Thank you.

44:50.125 --> 44:52.000
Come on.
We don't wanna miss the tree-lighting.

44:52.083 --> 44:52.958
Let's go!

45:00.208 --> 45:02.208
Merry Christmas, everyone.

45:02.291 --> 45:05.583
Please welcome
the mayor of Summit Springs.

45:08.208 --> 45:11.875
Welcome, everyone, to our annual
Christmas tree-lighting ceremony.

45:11.958 --> 45:15.000
You know, this is such a special event,

45:15.083 --> 45:16.458
and just between you and me,

45:16.541 --> 45:19.208
I think it's my favorite reason
to be mayor of Summit Springs.

45:21.166 --> 45:23.916
Ah! But you didn't come here
to listen to me yakking, right?

45:24.000 --> 45:27.625
You came in to see some lights.
So, hey, without further ado…

45:27.708 --> 45:30.583
Why don't you come on up here, sweetie,
and help me pull this switch?

45:30.666 --> 45:31.500
Me?

45:34.458 --> 45:37.708
When we count down, I want you
to push that little candy cane, okay?

45:38.208 --> 45:40.875
Summit Springs, are you ready?

45:40.958 --> 45:42.125
Yeah!

45:42.708 --> 45:44.875
All right! Count with me.

45:45.500 --> 45:50.750
Five, four, three, two, one!

45:51.708 --> 45:53.833
-Oh!

46:05.750 --> 46:07.083
Come on, I can't hear you.

46:07.166 --> 46:08.541
Oh, I can't sing.

46:08.625 --> 46:11.333
Who told you that?
Come on, it's Christmas.

46:39.750 --> 46:41.708
All right.
Good night, jellybean.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.083
She is out

46:55.125 --> 46:56.041
like a light.

46:57.625 --> 47:00.291
You know, um, when you first saw
that snow globe,

47:00.375 --> 47:03.333
you had this look in your eyes
like you had seen it before.

47:04.666 --> 47:07.916
Yeah, I suddenly had this memory
of being a little girl,

47:08.000 --> 47:11.083
and this beautiful woman
gave me something like that.

47:11.833 --> 47:13.750
And I think it might have been my mother.

47:14.250 --> 47:16.041
But then, it was gone.

47:16.125 --> 47:19.958
Well, I mean, at least you remembered
something. That's a start.

47:20.541 --> 47:21.416
Yeah.

47:27.125 --> 47:29.833
Well, it's been a long night.

47:29.916 --> 47:31.416
Yeah. Yeah. Uh…

47:31.500 --> 47:33.541
Yeah, I'm pretty beat too, so…

47:35.375 --> 47:36.208
Um…

47:37.541 --> 47:38.375
Good night.

47:39.625 --> 47:40.583
Good night.

47:41.666 --> 47:43.083
-Jake?
-Uh-huh?

47:43.583 --> 47:45.125
I just wanted to tell you

47:46.333 --> 47:48.791
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like you before

47:49.541 --> 47:53.083
because if I had,
I would definitely remember it.

47:59.375 --> 48:00.208
Good night.

48:16.125 --> 48:17.916
-Good morning.
-Good morning!

48:22.875 --> 48:24.875
It's just me, dear. I come to make the…

48:29.541 --> 48:32.250
The trick is, it's all in the wrists.

48:33.541 --> 48:34.666
Okay.

48:38.541 --> 48:41.333
Okay, that's okay. One more.
Do it again. Again.

48:41.416 --> 48:44.541
-Okay. You know, just use both hands.
-Okay.

48:44.625 --> 48:45.791
One,

48:45.875 --> 48:46.875
two,

48:47.541 --> 48:48.625
three!

48:48.708 --> 48:50.208
-Hey!

48:50.291 --> 48:52.750
There you go,
hand-eye coordination. All right!

48:52.833 --> 48:53.750
There you go.

48:54.416 --> 48:56.291
-I hope you like it.
-Yum!

48:59.833 --> 49:02.291
Just the right amount.

49:02.791 --> 49:03.875
Perfect.

49:03.958 --> 49:05.000
Okay.

49:18.291 --> 49:21.208
You have to make sure
you use lots of icing to keep it in place.

49:21.291 --> 49:22.708
-Okay. That good?
-Yeah.

49:22.791 --> 49:24.041
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

49:25.458 --> 49:26.291
Oh my…

49:26.875 --> 49:28.250
-Not cool.

49:28.333 --> 49:29.291
-Both of you!
-Hey!

49:29.375 --> 49:31.208
You're both in on this!

49:31.291 --> 49:34.583
All right, guys, remember,
inside edge, okay?

49:34.666 --> 49:36.666
Last one down buys pizza. Ready?

49:36.750 --> 49:37.583
Go!

49:38.166 --> 49:40.291
Let's go!

49:40.875 --> 49:44.000
-Looking great, everyone!
-Are you ready to ski?

49:44.083 --> 49:45.750
I don't know if I remember how.

49:45.833 --> 49:48.958
It's gonna be easy. Follow the kids,
take it slow, just like I said.

49:49.041 --> 49:51.000
-You're gonna be fine.
-Okay.

49:51.083 --> 49:53.250
-Now, let's see what you got. Let's go!

49:54.250 --> 49:55.291
Whoo!

49:57.916 --> 49:59.250
Not bad.

49:59.333 --> 50:00.333
Woo-hoo!

50:01.875 --> 50:02.708
Oh no.

50:06.083 --> 50:06.916
Hang on!

50:12.916 --> 50:13.875
Ooh!

50:13.958 --> 50:14.833
I got you!

50:20.791 --> 50:22.333
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

50:22.416 --> 50:23.291
It's okay.

50:25.458 --> 50:27.208
Thank you for saving me.

50:27.291 --> 50:28.208
Any time.

50:32.250 --> 50:33.125
Uh…

50:33.791 --> 50:36.250
All right, nice.
Here you go. That's the bill.

50:36.833 --> 50:37.666
You all be safe.

50:37.750 --> 50:39.291
-Thanks again.
-Thank you.

50:41.166 --> 50:43.583
Thanks for staying at the North Star.
And Merry Christmas.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.333
-You too.
-Bye, Sarah.

50:45.416 --> 50:46.250
Bye.

50:57.041 --> 50:57.958
-Alejandra?

50:58.041 --> 51:01.708
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
I didn't see you there.

51:03.458 --> 51:04.458
Are you okay?

51:05.541 --> 51:08.291
I'm fine. Just a little blue, I guess.

51:09.166 --> 51:12.125
Probably shouldn't have started
looking through this in the first place.

51:13.208 --> 51:14.041
What is it?

51:14.833 --> 51:16.500
I call it our memory book.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.958
Christmas cards, wedding programs,
notes from guests.

51:23.708 --> 51:26.708
Oh, your daughter. She's really beautiful.

51:26.791 --> 51:28.000
Thank you.

51:30.250 --> 51:32.541
You are beautiful too.

51:37.125 --> 51:40.083
I like to remind myself every now and then

51:40.166 --> 51:43.916
how our little family lodge
has touched other people's lives.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.333
Especially…

51:46.750 --> 51:49.416
…since we might
not be here much longer.

51:50.083 --> 51:51.708
I thought Jake didn't want to sell.

51:51.791 --> 51:53.541
He might not have a choice.

51:54.458 --> 51:55.958
The way things are going,

51:56.791 --> 51:59.791
this might be our last Christmas
at North Star Lodge.

52:01.375 --> 52:04.208
Anyway, that's nothing for you
to worry about.

52:05.458 --> 52:07.083
I've got to pick up, Avy.

52:07.958 --> 52:08.791
Ah…

52:08.875 --> 52:11.291
Can you put that back in Jake's desk
when you're done?

52:11.375 --> 52:12.750
-Sure.
-Thank you.

52:37.875 --> 52:40.875
-Hey, what's going on?
-Oh, hi. The drawer was stuck.

52:40.958 --> 52:43.000
Yeah, I've been meaning to fix that.

52:43.083 --> 52:44.708
This is really beautiful.

52:45.291 --> 52:47.625
-Why don't you put it on the tree?
-Um…

52:48.375 --> 52:49.333
Because it…

52:51.416 --> 52:52.791
I'm not ready to put it up.

52:53.708 --> 52:56.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's really none of my business.

52:56.083 --> 52:59.083
No, I'm… I'm sorry. I just… It's…

53:00.791 --> 53:05.125
We… We… Um, Carla and I
bought it together, and…

53:06.333 --> 53:07.541
And then she got sick.

53:08.916 --> 53:09.791
And…

53:11.916 --> 53:13.583
I don't… I don't wanna get rid of it,

53:13.666 --> 53:16.541
but I can't bring myself
to put it on the tree. So, I…

53:22.708 --> 53:25.875
You know what? I gotta go 'cause
I'm gonna be late for the toy drive.

53:25.958 --> 53:26.916
Uh, toy drive?

53:27.750 --> 53:31.750
Yeah. You know, Summit Springs
has one every year

53:31.833 --> 53:34.250
for families who are having
a rough go of it, so…

53:34.875 --> 53:36.041
That's really sweet.

53:36.125 --> 53:38.833
Yeah, well, you know, every kid
deserves something for Christmas.

53:40.333 --> 53:41.583
Do you need any help?

53:44.333 --> 53:46.000
Yes, that would be nice.

54:04.625 --> 54:07.208
-How's it going?
-I just finished my first one.

54:07.291 --> 54:08.125
Wow!

54:09.250 --> 54:12.541
Okay. Um, pretty good.
I'll show you a trick.

54:13.125 --> 54:16.125
You gotta use as little paper as possible.

54:16.208 --> 54:20.791
Wrapping technique shouldn't require
more than three pieces of tape.

54:20.875 --> 54:21.958
So you do it like this,

54:23.041 --> 54:24.333
and then like that.

54:27.000 --> 54:27.833
And like this.

54:29.666 --> 54:31.166
Very good.

54:31.250 --> 54:32.583
-Told you.

54:33.708 --> 54:36.625
-Jacob! I'm so happy you're here.
-Oh!

54:36.708 --> 54:39.500
Louise, you know I would never forget
my Christmas girlfriend.

54:39.583 --> 54:42.500
-It looks like you already have.
-This is Sarah.

54:43.125 --> 54:44.666
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

54:44.750 --> 54:46.416
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.291
Jake!
We need help sorting things out!

54:48.375 --> 54:50.083
All right. Um, I'll be right back.

54:50.166 --> 54:53.125
You two… don't talk about me
while I'm gone.

54:53.208 --> 54:56.041
-Hi. Can we drop our toys here?

54:56.125 --> 54:57.333
Hi, thank you.

54:58.250 --> 55:00.750
-Merry Christmas. Thank you so much.
-There you go.

55:03.708 --> 55:06.166
I don't know what we'd do
without Jake Russell.

55:06.250 --> 55:08.541
He volunteers. He donates money.

55:09.083 --> 55:12.291
I can't even count how many charities
he's helped out in town.

55:12.375 --> 55:14.291
I just wish that there was some way

55:14.375 --> 55:16.625
that Summit Springs
could show him how much he means to us.

55:16.708 --> 55:19.541
-Great job on this wrapping.
-I don't know if I did wrap…

55:24.916 --> 55:27.250
Again, thank you so much
for helping out tonight.

55:27.333 --> 55:30.333
Oh, thank you for inviting me.
Everyone was so nice.

55:32.041 --> 55:32.916
So…

55:34.958 --> 55:38.375
think you're going to remember any of this
when you get your memory back?

55:38.875 --> 55:40.125
I'll never forget it.

55:45.916 --> 55:48.041
We are standing under the mistletoe.

55:48.708 --> 55:50.333
Yes, we are.

56:01.333 --> 56:03.250
You know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

56:04.208 --> 56:06.041
I mean, what if you're with somebody.

56:06.666 --> 56:08.291
That would be unfortunate.

56:09.416 --> 56:10.416
For both of us.

56:14.583 --> 56:16.208
Yeah. Well…

56:55.041 --> 56:56.041
-I'm almost done.
-Yes.

56:56.125 --> 56:56.958
Morning!

56:57.916 --> 56:59.000
-Morning!
-Good morning.

56:59.083 --> 57:01.375
I have an idea
on how we can help the North Star.

57:04.416 --> 57:07.583
I've got the contacts
for almost every guest we've had

57:07.666 --> 57:09.333
over the past three decades.

57:09.416 --> 57:11.000
-This is perfect.
-Mm-hmm.

57:12.625 --> 57:13.583
What's it for?

57:13.666 --> 57:15.208
A North Star fundraiser.

57:15.833 --> 57:18.083
Cool. Have you talked to dad about it?

57:19.375 --> 57:21.000
No, absolutely not.

57:21.083 --> 57:22.583
-What?
-You heard me.

57:22.666 --> 57:25.625
There's no way I'm having a fundraiser
to save the lodge.

57:25.708 --> 57:27.291
No. It won't be a fundraiser.

57:27.375 --> 57:29.875
It'll be like a Christmas flashback party.

57:29.958 --> 57:32.333
And we'll invite all the guests
you've had over the years

57:32.416 --> 57:34.583
to celebrate their favorite
North Star memories.

57:35.166 --> 57:39.000
And, okay, yes, we'll ask for a donation,
but what's the big deal?

57:39.083 --> 57:41.416
The big deal is
I live in Summit Springs, okay?

57:41.500 --> 57:43.375
I don't want people
looking at me differently.

57:43.458 --> 57:45.291
I don't want them thinking
I need a handout.

57:45.791 --> 57:48.708
But you don't want to lose
the North Star either, do you?

57:51.833 --> 57:52.708
Maybe I do.

57:53.791 --> 57:54.833
You don't mean that.

57:54.916 --> 57:57.083
Look, I'm tired of struggling
with this place.

57:57.166 --> 57:59.375
I'm tired of everything
always breaking down.

57:59.458 --> 58:02.500
I'm tired of wondering
how we'll make it to the end of the month.

58:03.375 --> 58:06.000
Jake, you can't turn your back
on this lodge.

58:06.083 --> 58:10.208
-Think about all the memories you've made.
-I do. I do. All the time.

58:10.291 --> 58:12.750
And to be honest, you know,
I'd be happy to let some of them go.

58:13.958 --> 58:16.958
And what do you know about memories?
You can't even remember your name.

58:24.125 --> 58:25.250
Sarah, wait.

58:25.333 --> 58:26.250
Okay, look, I…

58:27.083 --> 58:28.416
It's not you.

58:28.500 --> 58:30.458
Okay, actually, it is you.

58:31.125 --> 58:32.916
Look, ever since you got here, you…

58:34.333 --> 58:36.291
Well, you've made me feel things…

58:36.791 --> 58:39.333
Things that I didn't ever think
I was ever going to feel again.

58:40.250 --> 58:43.375
And, yes, you're right. This place
does have a lot of memories for me.

58:45.125 --> 58:47.750
I guess I'm just, you know,
afraid of making

58:48.250 --> 58:49.208
new ones,

58:50.791 --> 58:52.458
even with somebody like you.

59:05.375 --> 59:06.208
Come in.

59:10.750 --> 59:12.000
Everything all right?

59:12.916 --> 59:13.750
Yeah.

59:15.333 --> 59:16.250
What's wrong?

59:18.083 --> 59:19.416
Nothing. Nothing, just…

59:19.500 --> 59:20.666
Is it Sarah?

59:24.166 --> 59:25.791
I know it's hard,

59:26.708 --> 59:28.416
especially this time of year.

59:30.375 --> 59:31.250
I don't know.

59:32.625 --> 59:36.416
I just… I don't really know
what I'm doing anymore.

59:37.708 --> 59:41.541
You've been doing everything you can
to hold this family together.

59:43.000 --> 59:45.833
But we are all right now.

59:48.708 --> 59:49.625
Jake.

59:51.791 --> 59:53.416
It's okay to let go.

1:00:23.583 --> 1:00:26.458
Sarah. We're making snowflakes.
Want to come help me?

1:00:26.541 --> 1:00:29.166
I'm sorry, I can't right now, Avy,
but maybe later.

1:00:29.250 --> 1:00:31.166
Alejandra, can I talk to you for a second?

1:00:31.250 --> 1:00:32.083
Of course.

1:00:32.166 --> 1:00:34.583
I think it's time for me to leave.

1:00:34.666 --> 1:00:35.541
Oh.

1:00:35.625 --> 1:00:38.625
Don't say that. You know you're welcome
to stay as long as it takes.

1:00:38.708 --> 1:00:42.583
Yes, thank you, but I think
it's just best for everyone I just go.

1:00:42.666 --> 1:00:44.125
Wait. What?

1:00:44.791 --> 1:00:46.041
Sarah, are you leaving?

1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:47.916
You can't be.

1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:49.500
I'm afraid so.

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.500
But I thought you were gonna
stay with us for Christmas.

1:00:52.583 --> 1:00:56.250
And I would love that,
but there's just been a change of plans.

1:00:57.500 --> 1:00:59.833
Yes, they have changed.

1:01:00.958 --> 1:01:01.958
Dad.

1:01:02.541 --> 1:01:03.708
What is that?

1:01:03.791 --> 1:01:06.000
Something I've been saving
for the right moment.

1:01:07.583 --> 1:01:09.916
But we need Sarah to help us put it up.

1:01:12.833 --> 1:01:13.708
Please.

1:01:14.833 --> 1:01:15.666
But you said…

1:01:15.750 --> 1:01:17.875
I know, but I don't wanna do this
without you.

1:01:31.083 --> 1:01:31.958
A little to the left.

1:01:32.041 --> 1:01:34.541
-How about that?
-And… perfect.

1:01:34.625 --> 1:01:36.416
It's beautiful, Jake.

1:01:37.083 --> 1:01:38.833
You know what this place needs right now?

1:01:38.916 --> 1:01:40.166
A Christmas party?

1:01:40.666 --> 1:01:43.291
-All right, let's do it! Let's go!

1:01:43.375 --> 1:01:45.208
All right, a little bit closer together.

1:01:45.291 --> 1:01:47.666
On the count of three, "Merry Christmas."

1:01:47.750 --> 1:01:49.583
One, two, three.

1:01:49.666 --> 1:01:51.583
Merry Christmas!

1:01:52.541 --> 1:01:54.416
All right, you guys enjoy the slopes.

1:01:54.500 --> 1:01:55.500
All right. Printing.

1:02:02.125 --> 1:02:04.208
Christmas Eve, come to North Star.

1:02:04.291 --> 1:02:05.833
There's a Christmas Eve party.

1:02:05.916 --> 1:02:09.541
Here you go. Merry Christmas.
Christmas party at the North Star.

1:02:10.208 --> 1:02:11.208
Oh, yeah.

1:02:12.083 --> 1:02:13.500
7:00 p.m., Christmas Eve.

1:02:13.583 --> 1:02:15.500
-There's a party at the North Star.
-Thank you!

1:02:15.583 --> 1:02:16.666
There.

1:02:18.208 --> 1:02:21.750
It's December 24th. I know you probably
have plans, but we'll be there.

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:38.458
Yep, dinner's ready.

1:02:38.541 --> 1:02:40.250
Time for some tasty beans.

1:02:41.375 --> 1:02:42.833
-There you go, buddy.
-Oh!

1:02:44.291 --> 1:02:45.958
-Thank you, my friend.
-Yeah.

1:02:47.208 --> 1:02:48.333
-Oh.

1:02:49.208 --> 1:02:50.041
Mm.

1:02:51.541 --> 1:02:54.500
These are the best canned beans

1:02:55.750 --> 1:02:57.166
I've ever tasted.

1:02:57.250 --> 1:03:00.250
Ralph! Have you considered
starting a survival blog?

1:03:00.333 --> 1:03:02.458
I'm sure I could get you sponsored.

1:03:02.541 --> 1:03:05.458
Well, thank you, Tad.
Wouldn't that be something?

1:03:05.541 --> 1:03:06.375
Yeah.

1:03:10.166 --> 1:03:11.416
Ho…

1:03:11.500 --> 1:03:12.416
-Hm.

1:03:12.916 --> 1:03:14.083
Hot.

1:03:14.166 --> 1:03:16.541
Yeah, they got a little kick.
It can sneak up on you.

1:03:16.625 --> 1:03:18.375
Yep! Getting that kick now.

1:03:19.083 --> 1:03:20.375
Hoo!

1:03:20.958 --> 1:03:21.875
Big kick!

1:03:23.041 --> 1:03:24.791
Not very sneaky.

1:03:30.125 --> 1:03:31.333
He's walking in now.

1:03:31.916 --> 1:03:35.125
Hi! I just got to the hotel.
So, give me a call when you get this.

1:03:35.208 --> 1:03:36.416
Thank you, Morgan.

1:03:36.500 --> 1:03:37.500
Terry?

1:03:38.291 --> 1:03:40.708
Mr. Belmont.
Hello, you're back.

1:03:40.791 --> 1:03:43.375
Hi. I need to talk to Sierra,
but she's not answering her phone.

1:03:43.458 --> 1:03:46.208
-Have her meet me in my office.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Belmont.

1:03:46.875 --> 1:03:48.333
I don't know where she is.

1:03:49.791 --> 1:03:50.875
What?

1:03:51.458 --> 1:03:53.833
I asked you to take care of her
while she was here.

1:03:53.916 --> 1:03:56.458
Well, yes, but she and Mr. Fairchild
went skiing the other day,

1:03:56.541 --> 1:03:58.791
and that's the last time
that I saw her. So…

1:03:58.875 --> 1:04:02.791
"The other day"? Are you telling me
you haven't seen my daughter in four days?

1:04:02.875 --> 1:04:05.458
Well, no, but I just thought
she and Mr. Fairchild

1:04:05.541 --> 1:04:07.458
wanted a little private time together.

1:04:07.541 --> 1:04:09.416
And she told me not to bother her.
Then… Well, I…

1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:11.541
-We.
-We found this note.

1:04:20.916 --> 1:04:23.500
My daughter never goes anywhere
without her luggage.

1:04:24.250 --> 1:04:26.291
You, have the security team
check the grounds.

1:04:26.375 --> 1:04:27.916
Search every inch of the resort.

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.583
-I'm on it.
-And you, call the Sheriff's Office.

1:04:30.666 --> 1:04:32.625
Okay. What do I say?

1:04:33.666 --> 1:04:35.625
You tell them that I want them
to find my daughter.

1:04:36.708 --> 1:04:37.541
Right.

1:04:57.166 --> 1:05:01.416
We're gonna need a search party.
Got some knuckleheads lost in the pass.

1:05:01.500 --> 1:05:03.750
<i> Copy that.</i>
<i>Do we have any idea who it is?</i>

1:05:06.750 --> 1:05:09.875
Yeah, it's Ralph. Poaching again.

1:05:12.291 --> 1:05:13.250
Yeah?

1:05:14.208 --> 1:05:15.791
Are you almost ready, dear?

1:05:15.875 --> 1:05:18.708
I'm just trying to find something to wear.

1:05:20.958 --> 1:05:23.791
Well, actually, that's why I'm here.

1:05:23.875 --> 1:05:27.916
I took the liberty of picking up a little
something for you to wear tonight.

1:05:28.416 --> 1:05:29.541
I hope it fits.

1:05:29.625 --> 1:05:32.708
Oh my gosh. Thank you so much.
You didn't have to.

1:05:32.791 --> 1:05:34.333
I wanted to.

1:05:35.208 --> 1:05:36.708
You make Jake smile.

1:05:37.625 --> 1:05:39.708
He hasn't done that in a long time.

1:05:42.166 --> 1:05:45.208
Oh! I brought you a pair of shoes too.

1:05:45.291 --> 1:05:46.416
Thank you.

1:05:48.833 --> 1:05:49.708
Hmm.

1:05:50.625 --> 1:05:52.333
-See you downstairs?
-Okay.

1:05:58.708 --> 1:06:00.916
Ralph, I'm afraid we're gonna have
to book you this time.

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:04.541
What? This is an outrage!
That man is a hero.

1:06:04.625 --> 1:06:08.041
-He was poaching on government land.
-He saved my life.

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:11.041
You'll have to arrest me too.

1:06:11.125 --> 1:06:12.291
Ted?

1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:14.541
Beau!

1:06:15.666 --> 1:06:16.916
What are you doing here?

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:20.041
-Oh, it's a long and terrifying tale.
-Where's my daughter?

1:06:20.125 --> 1:06:22.041
I don't know. I expect at the hotel?

1:06:22.125 --> 1:06:25.541
No, she's not at the hotel. And I was
told she's supposed to be with you.

1:06:25.625 --> 1:06:28.916
Well, she was, but then we got separated
when we were up on the mountain.

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.916
-I had just proposed to her.
-Proposed?

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:32.666
-Uh-huh.
-"Marriage" proposed?

1:06:32.750 --> 1:06:33.583
Yeah.

1:06:34.666 --> 1:06:38.666
-Looks like I'll be calling you "Dad."
-Hey, congratulations.

1:06:38.750 --> 1:06:41.375
-Thank you, friend.
-I know where she is. Come on.

1:06:41.458 --> 1:06:43.500
W-W-W-Wait. What about Ralph?

1:06:44.625 --> 1:06:46.375
Jasper, let him go.

1:06:47.458 --> 1:06:48.458
It's Christmas.

1:06:49.041 --> 1:06:50.791
Well, hey, thank you, Tad.

1:06:50.875 --> 1:06:52.291
Let's keep in touch, buddy.

1:06:59.291 --> 1:07:00.666
Your bracelets.

1:07:01.416 --> 1:07:02.625
Hey, what are you doing?

1:07:03.916 --> 1:07:05.083
Just checking.

1:07:05.166 --> 1:07:07.750
You know that that says,
"Do not open until Christmas."

1:07:07.833 --> 1:07:08.875
I'm watching you.

1:07:11.750 --> 1:07:15.208
Jake, do you think we have enough food?
I don't want to run out.

1:07:15.291 --> 1:07:17.666
I don't think it's gonna be a problem.
It's Christmas Eve.

1:07:17.750 --> 1:07:20.916
People got things to do.
It's a very last-minute party, so…

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.500
It's late, and no one's here yet.

1:07:22.583 --> 1:07:25.625
Don't give up, Jake.
You just need a little bit of faith.

1:07:31.208 --> 1:07:32.041
Wow!

1:07:32.541 --> 1:07:33.541
Sarah.

1:07:34.666 --> 1:07:36.250
I love your dress.

1:07:38.166 --> 1:07:39.208
You look…

1:07:39.708 --> 1:07:40.541
Beautiful.

1:07:41.458 --> 1:07:43.916
Thank you. Alejandra bought it for me.

1:07:44.625 --> 1:07:46.250
It's lovely on you.

1:07:47.291 --> 1:07:51.250
Avy, sweetheart, why don't you
come help me make some more appetizers.

1:07:51.333 --> 1:07:53.500
-But Dad said we don't need any more.
-Avy.

1:08:01.250 --> 1:08:02.250
So…

1:08:02.333 --> 1:08:05.500
So, everything's ready for tonight?

1:08:05.583 --> 1:08:07.333
Yeah, I think so. Um…

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:08.875
You wanna

1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:10.833
do a final inspection?

1:08:11.416 --> 1:08:12.250
Sure.

1:08:15.708 --> 1:08:18.208
Oh, the place looks great.

1:08:18.791 --> 1:08:20.791
Yeah. Moved out a bunch of the tables,

1:08:20.875 --> 1:08:23.541
put in a little dance floor, just in case.

1:08:25.708 --> 1:08:27.416
Maybe we should test it out?

1:08:28.250 --> 1:08:30.208
I'm not sure if I can dance, but…

1:09:04.833 --> 1:09:06.958
I have a really good feeling
about tonight.

1:09:09.250 --> 1:09:11.541
Is it weird if I kind of hope
nobody shows up?

1:09:25.208 --> 1:09:26.583
-Hello, hello!

1:09:27.291 --> 1:09:29.458
-Merry Christmas!
-Hey! You're here!

1:09:29.541 --> 1:09:31.166
Yeah, hey, sorry we're late.

1:09:31.250 --> 1:09:34.083
I got stuck behind Ed Hudson's snow plow
all the way up.

1:09:34.166 --> 1:09:36.208
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much for coming.

1:09:36.291 --> 1:09:37.875
Yeah, well, it's not just me.

1:09:37.958 --> 1:09:40.166
-Hey, hey, hey!

1:09:40.250 --> 1:09:41.583
Great to see you.

1:09:41.666 --> 1:09:43.583
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas!

1:09:43.666 --> 1:09:45.666
Merry Christmas!

1:09:45.750 --> 1:09:47.541
Merry Christmas!

1:09:47.625 --> 1:09:50.041
-Get some food, refreshments.
-Thank you.

1:09:50.625 --> 1:09:51.666
Hi, hey! Thank you.

1:09:51.750 --> 1:09:52.666
Hey, how are you?

1:09:53.166 --> 1:09:54.458
-Thank you for coming.
-Hey, Jake.

1:10:08.416 --> 1:10:10.000
-Great to see you!

1:10:10.083 --> 1:10:13.833
-Everybody seems to be having a good time.
-Yes. Now here's your chance. Go.

1:10:13.916 --> 1:10:17.166
No, no. I'm not gonna get up there.
I wouldn't know what to say.

1:10:17.250 --> 1:10:18.666
Don't worry, you're gonna be great.

1:10:18.750 --> 1:10:21.291
Everyone is gonna love you.
They're having so much fun.

1:10:27.416 --> 1:10:29.333
Excuse me. Uh… Excuse me, everybody.

1:10:30.875 --> 1:10:32.166
Um, I just want to say,

1:10:32.250 --> 1:10:35.208
if you see a gingerbread house,
please don't take a bite.

1:10:35.291 --> 1:10:37.166
-It is purely decorative.

1:10:37.250 --> 1:10:38.250
I'm talking to you, Kenny.

1:10:39.125 --> 1:10:41.375
No, I kid. Um, anyway, hello, everybody.

1:10:41.458 --> 1:10:43.666
My name is Jake. I'm the owner of the--

1:10:43.750 --> 1:10:45.666
I think everyone knows who you are, Jake.

1:10:47.041 --> 1:10:49.666
Good point. Um… Okay, well, anyway.

1:10:49.750 --> 1:10:52.833
Thank you all, uh, for being here tonight.

1:10:54.833 --> 1:10:55.833
You can do this.

1:10:55.916 --> 1:10:57.583
I just wanted to say…

1:10:58.291 --> 1:10:59.125
Um…

1:11:01.166 --> 1:11:04.750
Well, the thing is, the North Star, uh…

1:11:07.375 --> 1:11:10.333
Well, there is this situation, and, uh…

1:11:13.833 --> 1:11:15.208
I… I can't do this.

1:11:15.291 --> 1:11:21.375
You know, I remember the first time
our family came to the North Star Lodge.

1:11:22.291 --> 1:11:25.416
You took my son under your wing
and taught him to ski.

1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:28.000
And I will admit, he wasn't a quick study.

1:11:29.458 --> 1:11:31.833
No. He was… He was not.

1:11:32.458 --> 1:11:33.791
He's a Ski Patrol now.

1:11:35.166 --> 1:11:39.916
Anyway, I, uh, figured I owe you this much
for ski lessons.

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.125
Sorry it's late.

1:11:41.208 --> 1:11:43.375
Howard, I… I can't. That's…

1:11:44.125 --> 1:11:45.333
Wow, I…

1:11:45.416 --> 1:11:48.708
When we got married,
we could not afford a honeymoon.

1:11:49.375 --> 1:11:52.041
Jake, you gave us the biggest suite
in the place for the weekend,

1:11:52.125 --> 1:11:55.958
champagne and everything,
and you wouldn't take a dime for it, so…

1:11:56.041 --> 1:11:58.500
We want to give you… this.

1:12:00.083 --> 1:12:02.791
Thank you for this. Thank you so much.

1:12:03.583 --> 1:12:04.625
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

1:12:04.708 --> 1:12:07.833
I think this is good a time as any
to make a little announcement of my own.

1:12:08.666 --> 1:12:12.375
Summit Springs town council
has put forth a proposal

1:12:12.458 --> 1:12:15.041
to have the North Star Lodge
declared a historic site.

1:12:18.083 --> 1:12:18.916
Oh, wow.

1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:24.958
Now that should help a bit with funds
and grants for renovations and so forth.

1:12:25.458 --> 1:12:26.708
Now, on a personal note…

1:12:28.750 --> 1:12:32.000
Well, here's for that time
you towed my car out of that snowbank.

1:12:32.083 --> 1:12:35.250
Oh my gosh. I can't believe
you remembered that.

1:12:36.333 --> 1:12:37.750
You're a good man, Jake.

1:12:37.833 --> 1:12:39.875
Thank you so much, wow.

1:12:39.958 --> 1:12:40.958
We love you, Jake.

1:12:41.041 --> 1:12:42.208
Thank you so much.

1:12:42.291 --> 1:12:43.833
-Thank you, guys.
-Happy holidays.

1:12:43.916 --> 1:12:44.875
-Gosh.
-Merry Christmas.

1:12:44.958 --> 1:12:47.083
Guys, thank you so much. Merry Christmas.

1:12:47.166 --> 1:12:48.958
-Merry Christmas, Jake.
-Thank you.

1:12:49.041 --> 1:12:50.250
Thank you, everyone.

1:12:50.333 --> 1:12:52.375
-You deserve it.
-Merry Christmas.

1:12:52.458 --> 1:12:54.750
-Thank you.
-We love the North Star.

1:12:54.833 --> 1:12:57.041
We're happy to do
something for you for a change.

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:04.833
I really…

1:13:04.916 --> 1:13:07.166
I really don't know what to say. Gosh.

1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:09.791
It's all, uh…

1:13:10.916 --> 1:13:13.166
It's all a little overwhelming for me
right now. Um…

1:13:14.041 --> 1:13:16.291
I would like to say one thing, though. Um…

1:13:16.375 --> 1:13:18.416
None of this here tonight
would be possible

1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:21.333
if it weren't for a very special guest

1:13:21.416 --> 1:13:23.666
that we have staying here at the lodge.

1:13:24.250 --> 1:13:26.166
She's changed the way I see, uh…

1:13:27.500 --> 1:13:28.916
a lot of things, um,

1:13:30.541 --> 1:13:32.208
not the least of which is myself.

1:13:32.291 --> 1:13:35.125
So, can we just, uh…
Can we get her up here? Uh…

1:13:36.791 --> 1:13:38.541
Will you come up here for a second?

1:13:40.166 --> 1:13:43.041
Everybody, would you please give
a big thank you to--

1:13:43.125 --> 1:13:44.500
Sierra!

1:13:44.583 --> 1:13:48.166
I found you at last! Darling!

1:13:49.458 --> 1:13:50.416
Look at you.

1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:53.250
I've searched,
and I've searched.

1:13:53.333 --> 1:13:55.708
There you go. Reunited for Christmas.

1:13:56.291 --> 1:13:58.000
So your name is Sierra.

1:13:58.083 --> 1:14:00.125
Yes. My daughter.

1:14:00.208 --> 1:14:02.041
-What did he say?
-His daughter?

1:14:02.125 --> 1:14:03.000
Sierra.

1:14:04.041 --> 1:14:05.583
I remember that name.

1:14:08.875 --> 1:14:10.250
That's my name.

1:14:10.333 --> 1:14:12.416
Well, of course it's your name.

1:14:13.333 --> 1:14:14.166
Who are you?

1:14:14.250 --> 1:14:17.791
Hello? It's me Tad Fairchild, your fiancé.

1:14:18.708 --> 1:14:20.125
-I'm engaged?
-Yeah.

1:14:20.208 --> 1:14:23.791
You're… Mr. Belmont's daughter?

1:14:25.583 --> 1:14:26.541
Dad.

1:14:26.625 --> 1:14:28.208
Yes. Yes, honey.

1:14:32.916 --> 1:14:35.208
And I've met you before. Last week.

1:14:35.291 --> 1:14:37.750
-Um… Mr. Russell?
-Yeah, Jake.

1:14:37.833 --> 1:14:39.875
And I-I… I… Sorry, I…

1:14:40.833 --> 1:14:42.208
I didn't know who you were.

1:14:42.791 --> 1:14:43.916
I didn't remember.

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.583
I bet you'll remember this.

1:14:51.208 --> 1:14:52.166
It's too big.

1:14:53.333 --> 1:14:55.333
-I think I told you that, right?
-Mm-hmm.

1:14:55.833 --> 1:14:57.708
Tad.

1:14:57.791 --> 1:15:01.083
I was skiing, and I… and I fell,
and I hit a tree.

1:15:02.166 --> 1:15:03.666
And then I ended up here,

1:15:04.291 --> 1:15:05.375
with you.

1:15:06.041 --> 1:15:06.875
Jake.

1:15:08.291 --> 1:15:09.166
With you.

1:15:13.416 --> 1:15:15.250
I have no idea what's transpired here,

1:15:15.333 --> 1:15:17.958
but clearly, you've taken
very good care of my daughter.

1:15:18.041 --> 1:15:19.625
And I appreciate that a great deal.

1:15:19.708 --> 1:15:22.333
Let's get you back to the hotel,
okay, sweetie?

1:15:22.416 --> 1:15:24.958
Nice, hot bath, maybe some champagne
to help clear your head.

1:15:25.041 --> 1:15:26.708
Yeah, the hotel.
I should get back…

1:15:26.791 --> 1:15:28.125
That's right.

1:15:28.208 --> 1:15:29.291
Sarah, wait!

1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:33.666
I don't want you to go.

1:15:33.750 --> 1:15:35.750
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

1:15:36.708 --> 1:15:38.041
But I have to go home.

1:15:38.125 --> 1:15:39.375
Come on, honey.

1:15:47.166 --> 1:15:48.625
I don't even know what to say.

1:15:50.083 --> 1:15:51.250
Thank you so much.

1:15:52.125 --> 1:15:53.958
Yeah. Forget about it.

1:15:58.833 --> 1:15:59.708
Goodbye.

1:16:00.875 --> 1:16:02.958
Dad? Where is Sarah going?

1:16:05.125 --> 1:16:08.208
Her name is Sierra, honey.
She's going home.

1:16:41.291 --> 1:16:42.708
-Jake?
-Uh-huh?

1:16:43.208 --> 1:16:47.458
I just wanted to tell you, I don't think
I've ever met anyone like you before.

1:16:52.166 --> 1:16:53.500
You all right?

1:17:03.125 --> 1:17:04.166
Three.

1:17:04.250 --> 1:17:05.083
Hey!

1:17:07.333 --> 1:17:09.791
I know what I said,
but I don't wanna do this without you.

1:17:18.041 --> 1:17:18.916
Beautiful.

1:17:36.916 --> 1:17:39.208
Miss Belmont? Are you up yet?

1:17:39.291 --> 1:17:40.125
I'm up.

1:17:40.625 --> 1:17:43.041
Mr. Fairchild just wanted me to remind you

1:17:43.125 --> 1:17:46.041
that he's arranged a press conference
in two hours.

1:17:46.125 --> 1:17:47.666
There's been quite a-- Ooh! Sparkly.

1:17:47.750 --> 1:17:49.000
Oh, you can come in.

1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:53.583
Uh, there's been quite a bit
of media attention for your ordeal.

1:17:54.958 --> 1:17:57.333
Miss Belmont, what are you doing?

1:17:57.416 --> 1:18:00.000
Oh, I'm just helping
the housekeepers out a bit.

1:18:00.083 --> 1:18:02.166
It is Christmas after all.

1:18:02.250 --> 1:18:03.875
Are you feeling all right?

1:18:03.958 --> 1:18:05.083
Yeah.

1:18:05.166 --> 1:18:07.416
I found this gorgeous piece,
just flown in from Milan.

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:09.583
I think I'm gonna go simple today.

1:18:09.666 --> 1:18:10.750
Oh, okay.

1:18:10.833 --> 1:18:11.708
Thank you.

1:18:11.791 --> 1:18:13.208
Caviar?

1:18:13.791 --> 1:18:16.458
Actually, I'm in the mood
for something different this morning.

1:18:16.541 --> 1:18:17.708
She's not acting like herself.

1:18:17.791 --> 1:18:19.375
-I thought you should know.
-That's odd.

1:18:19.458 --> 1:18:22.791
Hope her experience at that dreadful
hostel hasn't traumatized her.

1:18:22.875 --> 1:18:23.875
Wait for it.

1:18:30.125 --> 1:18:31.750
Sierra, what are you doing?

1:18:31.833 --> 1:18:33.583
I'm making breakfast.

1:18:33.666 --> 1:18:36.250
But, darling, the press conference
is in 30 minutes.

1:18:36.333 --> 1:18:38.000
You need to get dressed.

1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:40.333
I am dressed.

1:18:44.333 --> 1:18:45.291
Mm.

1:18:45.375 --> 1:18:46.500
Mm-mm.

1:18:47.083 --> 1:18:47.916
Mm.

1:18:56.125 --> 1:18:57.125
Dad!

1:18:58.166 --> 1:18:59.291
Thank you!

1:18:59.375 --> 1:19:01.708
Oh! You are welcome.

1:19:01.791 --> 1:19:02.916
I love my book.

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:04.458
So glad you like it.

1:19:04.541 --> 1:19:06.375
I'm gonna try them on right now.

1:19:06.458 --> 1:19:08.833
Thank you so much for my awesome helmet!

1:19:09.333 --> 1:19:11.166
All right.
I'm just gonna clean up a little bit.

1:19:11.250 --> 1:19:12.083
Me too.

1:19:17.041 --> 1:19:19.333
People were very generous last night.

1:19:19.416 --> 1:19:20.500
Yeah, they were.

1:19:21.583 --> 1:19:24.583
I don't think it's gonna make a difference
if we don't get any reservations.

1:19:24.666 --> 1:19:25.958
Yeah, you're right.

1:19:26.458 --> 1:19:28.250
And we're gonna need a Christmas miracle.

1:19:28.333 --> 1:19:30.583
<i> This breaking news is just in.</i>
-Dad!

1:19:30.666 --> 1:19:32.416
<i>Missing heiress Sierra Belmont,</i>

1:19:32.500 --> 1:19:34.500
<i>daughter of hotel magnate</i>
<i>Beauregard Belmont…</i>

1:19:34.583 --> 1:19:35.500
Come here.

1:19:35.583 --> 1:19:36.541
<i>…has been found.</i>

1:19:36.625 --> 1:19:38.583
<i>Let's go live now to the press conference.</i>

1:19:38.666 --> 1:19:41.208
<i>Miss Belmont. Would you tell us</i>
<i>in your own words what happened?</i>

1:19:41.291 --> 1:19:43.500
<i>Before I answer any questions,</i>

1:19:43.583 --> 1:19:47.500
<i>I would like to thank Jake Russell</i>
<i>and his family at the North Star Lodge.</i>

1:19:47.583 --> 1:19:50.541
<i>They took very good care of me</i>
<i>at their charming ski resort.</i>

1:19:51.041 --> 1:19:52.375
And I highly recommend it.

1:19:52.458 --> 1:19:54.416
-That's the North Star Lodge.

1:19:54.500 --> 1:19:56.333
Ms. Belmont, what are your plans
for the future?

1:19:56.416 --> 1:20:00.250
Let me answer that by showing you… this.

1:20:01.291 --> 1:20:03.125
-Tell us about the proposal.
-Mr. Fairchild?

1:20:03.208 --> 1:20:05.500
-Just one more question.
-Does this mean you're eloping?

1:20:05.583 --> 1:20:06.708
<i> Isn't it beautiful?</i>

1:20:06.791 --> 1:20:08.333
<i> Who designed the ring?</i>

1:20:08.416 --> 1:20:10.166
<i>It's by Jefferson Diamonds.</i>

1:20:10.250 --> 1:20:13.041
#JeffersonJewelryForYou.

1:20:13.125 --> 1:20:14.083
So, you're engaged.

1:20:14.166 --> 1:20:17.041
Mr. Fairchild has asked me to marry him.

1:20:17.125 --> 1:20:19.125
-But I--
-You must be excited, Mr. Belmont.

1:20:19.208 --> 1:20:20.333
Oh, um…

1:20:21.041 --> 1:20:23.875
Excited doesn't come close
to describing how I feel.

1:20:24.958 --> 1:20:26.416
And when's the big day?

1:20:27.958 --> 1:20:29.208
That's still in discussion.

1:20:29.291 --> 1:20:30.375
<i>We're keeping that secret.</i>

1:20:30.458 --> 1:20:32.750
<i>Actually, we're catching a plane</i>
<i>in a couple of hours</i>

1:20:32.833 --> 1:20:34.750
<i>to an undisclosed destination.</i>

1:20:34.833 --> 1:20:36.416
<i>So, don't know if--</i>

1:20:37.208 --> 1:20:38.916
-I think we've seen enough.

1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:40.000
I'll get that.

1:20:46.041 --> 1:20:48.708
Guess my Christmas wish
didn't come true after all.

1:20:49.666 --> 1:20:51.208
What do you mean, sweetie?

1:20:54.875 --> 1:20:57.125
When Grandma and I
were at The Wishing Tree,

1:20:57.208 --> 1:20:58.958
I didn't make a wish for myself.

1:20:59.791 --> 1:21:01.041
I made it for you, Dad.

1:21:01.125 --> 1:21:03.416
You gave your wish up for me?

1:21:03.500 --> 1:21:05.875
I wished for you to find someone to love.

1:21:06.916 --> 1:21:08.916
You take such good care of all of us.

1:21:09.500 --> 1:21:12.750
I just wanted you to have someone
take care of you too.

1:21:13.541 --> 1:21:15.916
Someone like Sarah.

1:21:17.625 --> 1:21:20.041
Avy, honey, um… I just…
It's just not that easy.

1:21:20.125 --> 1:21:23.250
Sure, it is. You like her, don't you?

1:21:24.166 --> 1:21:26.666
-Well, yeah, but it's not--
-Did you ever tell her?

1:21:28.791 --> 1:21:30.416
Not in so many words, no.

1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:31.916
There's still time, Dad.

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:34.625
I think you should tell her.

1:21:35.625 --> 1:21:39.083
-Go get dressed. Go tell her. Let's go!
-Okay, all right.

1:21:39.166 --> 1:21:41.375
The roads are closed
at this end of the valley.

1:21:41.458 --> 1:21:42.708
I'll take the snowmobile!

1:21:47.875 --> 1:21:48.958
Maybe not.

1:21:51.250 --> 1:21:52.208
Dad?

1:21:53.125 --> 1:21:54.250
What is that?

1:21:56.250 --> 1:21:57.083
What is that?

1:22:00.833 --> 1:22:01.833
Whoa!

1:22:01.916 --> 1:22:03.375
What is this doing here?

1:22:03.458 --> 1:22:06.875
-Did you and Grandma do this?
-No. Where did it come from?

1:22:07.916 --> 1:22:10.625
I don't know. I'll go get Balthazar.
You coming?

1:22:10.708 --> 1:22:12.125
-You bet!
-All right.

1:22:13.458 --> 1:22:14.875
My Christmas wish.

1:22:16.083 --> 1:22:17.750
It is coming true.

1:22:23.875 --> 1:22:27.250
A couple of hours from now, we'll be
taking selfies on a beautiful beach.

1:22:27.333 --> 1:22:28.666
You know what? You go on ahead.

1:22:28.750 --> 1:22:31.250
-Um, I'll meet you at the car.
-Don't be too long.

1:22:31.333 --> 1:22:33.291
-I won't.
-Don't want to miss the flight.

1:22:33.875 --> 1:22:34.708
Daddy?

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.416
I'm really sorry
I didn't get a chance to tell you

1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:41.708
about me and Tad, the engagement.

1:22:41.791 --> 1:22:42.916
Oh, it's okay, honey.

1:22:44.125 --> 1:22:47.208
You know, the most important thing to me
is that you're happy.

1:22:47.958 --> 1:22:49.541
You are happy, aren't you?

1:22:49.625 --> 1:22:50.458
Yeah.

1:22:51.500 --> 1:22:52.375
About the job.

1:22:52.458 --> 1:22:55.375
Don't worry about the job.
It'll be here when you get back.

1:22:55.458 --> 1:22:58.000
That's the thing. I don't want it to be.

1:22:58.708 --> 1:22:59.958
I don't understand.

1:23:00.041 --> 1:23:03.958
Vice President of Atmosphere?
You just did that to take care of me.

1:23:04.041 --> 1:23:06.500
Well, maybe a little, but I--

1:23:06.583 --> 1:23:09.208
And I love you for it,
and I'll always be your daughter.

1:23:09.708 --> 1:23:13.833
I just… I need to find my own way.
I hope you're not angry.

1:23:13.916 --> 1:23:14.791
Angry?

1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:17.333
No.

1:23:18.625 --> 1:23:20.916
I don't think I've ever been
more proud of you.

1:23:21.750 --> 1:23:22.708
Really?

1:23:22.791 --> 1:23:25.125
I told you I promised your mother
that I'd take care of you.

1:23:26.708 --> 1:23:27.541
Well…

1:23:28.791 --> 1:23:31.166
Looks like you're starting
to take care of yourself.

1:23:32.541 --> 1:23:33.500
I love you, Dad.

1:23:35.625 --> 1:23:36.625
I love you too.

1:23:37.625 --> 1:23:39.416
Your mother would be so proud of you.

1:23:39.916 --> 1:23:41.333
Thanks, Daddy.

1:23:43.916 --> 1:23:44.750
Okay.

1:23:47.500 --> 1:23:48.375
All right.

1:23:52.750 --> 1:23:54.791
Merry Christmas, North Star Lodge.

1:23:54.875 --> 1:23:57.000
<i>…place on the news?</i>
-Yes, this is the place.

1:23:57.083 --> 1:23:58.833
-<i> I need a reservation.</i>
For how many?

1:23:59.416 --> 1:24:00.250
When?

1:24:00.333 --> 1:24:03.208
-Oh, may I place you on hold for a moment?

1:24:03.291 --> 1:24:04.166
Thank you.

1:24:04.250 --> 1:24:06.250
-Merry Christmas, North Star Lodge.

1:24:06.333 --> 1:24:08.541
<i>Is this the place</i>
<i>where Sierra Belmont was?</i>

1:24:08.625 --> 1:24:11.541
Yes, this is the place
where Sierra Belmont stayed.

1:24:11.625 --> 1:24:13.875
Oh, yes. For how many?

1:24:14.500 --> 1:24:16.458
-Oh! Uh…

1:24:16.958 --> 1:24:18.166
North Star Lodge?

1:24:20.041 --> 1:24:21.208
Oh my goodness.

1:24:22.208 --> 1:24:23.416
Can you hold, please?

1:24:23.500 --> 1:24:25.916
Let's go, Balthazar! Good boy!

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:30.125
Alejandra, hey!

1:24:30.208 --> 1:24:33.083
-The phone is lighting up like Christmas.
-<i>You're kidding.</i>

1:24:33.166 --> 1:24:34.041
Jake…

1:24:34.708 --> 1:24:36.125
we're sold out!

1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:42.000
Oh. Can I get you anything?

1:24:42.500 --> 1:24:44.083
My jacket, maybe?

1:24:45.458 --> 1:24:47.375
-Yeah, 'cause winter is like…
-Yeah.

1:24:47.458 --> 1:24:48.416
Okay.

1:24:51.875 --> 1:24:54.291
Sierra! Ready to go, darling?

1:24:59.458 --> 1:25:00.583
What are you doing?

1:25:01.083 --> 1:25:02.083
I'm sorry, Tad.

1:25:02.583 --> 1:25:06.083
You're a great guy,
but I'm just not ready for this yet.

1:25:06.166 --> 1:25:08.208
I thought I was, but I'm not.

1:25:13.708 --> 1:25:15.416
Are you breaking up with me?

1:25:16.500 --> 1:25:17.500
On Christmas Day?

1:25:18.791 --> 1:25:21.750
I know you, Tad.
You'll be okay by New Year's.

1:25:21.833 --> 1:25:22.666
Huh.

1:25:26.125 --> 1:25:28.333
Do you mind if I post about this
on my page?

1:25:28.416 --> 1:25:30.458
My followers will love it.

1:25:30.541 --> 1:25:33.166
Nothing like a breakup
to really add to your numbers.

1:25:35.833 --> 1:25:37.333
Merry Christmas, Tad.

1:25:41.708 --> 1:25:42.708
Good luck to you.

1:25:47.083 --> 1:25:51.083
I am so sorry, Mr. Fairchild.

1:25:51.166 --> 1:25:54.250
Oh! And at the holidays too. Oh.

1:25:56.166 --> 1:25:58.041
You. Terry.

1:25:58.125 --> 1:25:58.958
Yep.

1:25:59.583 --> 1:26:01.458
What are you doing for New Year's?

1:26:08.708 --> 1:26:09.541
Whoa!

1:26:10.416 --> 1:26:12.333
All right.
Are you okay to watch Balthazar?

1:26:12.416 --> 1:26:13.875
-Of course. Go find Sarah.
-All right.

1:26:13.958 --> 1:26:15.208
Wait!

1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.041
-Much better.

1:26:23.083 --> 1:26:25.666
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Stop the car. Don't move.

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:27.833
Hold on!

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.333
Look, can you just give me…
give me one second.

1:26:37.083 --> 1:26:40.166
Look, okay, I… I know
we barely know each other,

1:26:40.250 --> 1:26:42.708
and you'll probably gonna think
I'm crazy for saying this.

1:26:46.458 --> 1:26:49.833
But I… I can't let you leave without
telling you I'm falling in love with you.

1:26:54.083 --> 1:26:58.416
Well, that's very flattering,
but I have other plans.

1:27:00.583 --> 1:27:01.833
Happy Christmas.

1:27:03.625 --> 1:27:04.750
Happy Christmas.

1:27:10.750 --> 1:27:11.958
Uh, excuse me, son.

1:27:13.125 --> 1:27:16.541
I believe what you're looking for
is in the back courtyard.

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.916
-Sierra!
-Jake?

1:27:39.166 --> 1:27:40.541
I thought you were leaving.

1:27:41.291 --> 1:27:44.208
Uh, no, change of plans. I'm staying here

1:27:44.291 --> 1:27:45.208
without Tad.

1:27:45.291 --> 1:27:46.125
You are?

1:27:46.708 --> 1:27:47.750
Uh-huh.

1:27:48.958 --> 1:27:51.291
So, what are you doing here?

1:27:54.250 --> 1:27:57.166
Uh… I… I just wanted to say thank you.

1:27:57.250 --> 1:28:00.458
I just found out the North Star
is sold out for the rest of the season.

1:28:00.541 --> 1:28:02.541
Really? Hm. Sold out, huh?

1:28:03.083 --> 1:28:05.208
Sounds like you might need
some help running the place.

1:28:05.291 --> 1:28:07.125
That would be amazing.

1:28:07.208 --> 1:28:10.083
Well, my dad did also mention
investing in the North Star,

1:28:10.166 --> 1:28:11.958
but I didn't think you'd be interested.

1:28:12.041 --> 1:28:13.125
-Right.

1:28:13.625 --> 1:28:16.875
I did say I would try to convince you
over the holidays.

1:28:17.541 --> 1:28:20.541
That is, if you wouldn't mind
spending them with me.

1:28:23.083 --> 1:28:24.833
Well, you know what? Um…

1:28:24.916 --> 1:28:27.083
There is this holiday tradition.

1:28:27.166 --> 1:28:28.958
But I bumped my head on the way over here,

1:28:29.041 --> 1:28:31.291
and for the life of me,
I can't remember what it is.

1:28:31.375 --> 1:28:33.208
-It's, uh…

1:28:33.791 --> 1:28:36.125
Yeah, I think
I can help you out with that.

1:28:38.166 --> 1:28:39.000
Oh.

1:28:51.250 --> 1:28:52.375
There they are.

1:28:52.458 --> 1:28:53.625
Sierra!

1:28:57.041 --> 1:28:58.958
-You didn't leave after all.
-Hey!

1:28:59.041 --> 1:29:00.375
-Hey.

1:29:06.375 --> 1:29:07.291
What, um…

1:29:07.875 --> 1:29:08.958
What happened to Ted?

1:29:09.041 --> 1:29:12.666
Oh, it's Tad, Daddy.
And, uh… It wasn't meant to be.

1:29:12.750 --> 1:29:15.541
-Happy you're here, Jake.
-It's good to see you, Mr. Belmont.

1:29:17.125 --> 1:29:20.333
-What a Christmas, guys.
-Yeah, it's one I'll never forget.

1:29:22.791 --> 1:29:25.250
And I see you've met my daughter, Avy…

1:29:34.666 --> 1:29:37.125
Merry Christmas!

1:29:37.208 --> 1:29:39.208
Merry Christmas!

1:29:46.250 --> 1:29:49.125
Tad, I told you a place in the lobby.
Where are you?

1:29:49.791 --> 1:29:51.125
Oh my gosh.

1:29:52.958 --> 1:29:54.583
Shoot. Oh my God.

1:29:57.958 --> 1:29:59.416
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.

1:30:00.250 --> 1:30:01.625
It's chaos.

1:30:01.708 --> 1:30:03.750
Nothing. We're rolling.

1:30:06.166 --> 1:30:07.458
-Mm.

1:30:08.666 --> 1:30:09.541
Let's go!

1:30:10.208 --> 1:30:12.041
Come on! Moving skis. Okay, let's do it.

1:30:12.125 --> 1:30:14.250
-We're not gonna act.
-Yeah, yeah.

1:30:14.791 --> 1:30:16.791
You've made a Christmas wish without me?

1:30:21.291 --> 1:30:24.458
This is so beautiful.
Why don't you put it on the tree?

1:30:24.541 --> 1:30:26.833
On Dasher! On Dancer!

1:30:35.833 --> 1:30:37.250
-So?
-Hey!

1:30:40.666 --> 1:30:41.500
Giddy-up!

1:30:41.583 --> 1:30:44.000
Tad, it's not voice-activated!
Get me off of this thing!

1:30:44.083 --> 1:30:44.916
You're ridiculous!

1:30:47.875 --> 1:30:50.500
<i>Un, deux, trois!</i>

1:30:51.708 --> 1:30:53.000
-Oh!

1:30:56.291 --> 1:30:57.500
Oh, my hands!

1:30:57.583 --> 1:30:59.750
-What's your name, savior?
-Ralph.

1:31:03.500 --> 1:31:04.333
What?

1:31:05.208 --> 1:31:06.208
-Sorry.

1:31:06.291 --> 1:31:08.125
-I'm sorry, smiling.
-I'm sorry.

1:31:08.208 --> 1:31:10.458
Blinking the whole time?

1:31:10.541 --> 1:31:13.708
I'm not used to seeing women here
at the lodge.

1:31:14.500 --> 1:31:16.416
Reindeer!

1:31:18.541 --> 1:31:20.958
We landed on the Moon!

1:31:23.208 --> 1:31:25.541
You're off-key. You're off-key, okay?

1:31:26.333 --> 1:31:27.208
Action!

1:31:30.250 --> 1:31:32.375
I think you just need to be
more polite, darling.

1:31:33.333 --> 1:31:34.791
-Be polite.
-God!

1:31:36.541 --> 1:31:37.375
Whoo!

1:31:38.750 --> 1:31:41.291
Give me one more because I can't stop…

1:31:41.375 --> 1:31:43.083
I can't stop laughing right now.

1:31:43.166 --> 1:31:44.041
-Oh!

1:31:45.583 --> 1:31:46.416
Not funny.

1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:49.333
We're gonna get so many partiers.

1:31:56.083 --> 1:31:57.708
New Year's Eve-- Christmas Eve.

1:32:00.166 --> 1:32:02.333
-Do I have anything on my nose?
-Yeah.

1:32:02.875 --> 1:32:04.708
Nothing's gonna get killed.

1:32:06.791 --> 1:32:08.625
I don't know how that happened.

1:32:08.708 --> 1:32:11.666
All you have to go is just go up there
and show your heart--

1:32:11.750 --> 1:32:13.583
What? What am I doing?

1:32:13.666 --> 1:32:14.500
Fine by me.

1:32:17.666 --> 1:32:20.375
Would you please tell
that large, muscular man behind me

1:32:20.458 --> 1:32:22.375
to quit stealing my close-up?

1:32:24.666 --> 1:32:26.625
-Excuse me, sir?

1:32:30.666 --> 1:32:33.000
-No, no, no, no.

1:32:34.250 --> 1:32:35.291
And cut.
