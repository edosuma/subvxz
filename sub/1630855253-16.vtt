I tried calling Olive,
but she didn't pick up.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.698
[Cal] Dad smashed her phone.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.325
You don't remember, Paul?
You beat your wife.

00:34.325 --> 00:37.412
You don't understand.
My anxiety, it's too much.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.456
Autumn had a daughter.
She's eight years old.

00:39.456 --> 00:42.459
She already lost custody
due to a prison stint back in 2011.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.793
I'll do whatever I have to.

00:43.793 --> 00:46.588
When I get back to Washington,
I'm gonna have you fired.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.924
Then you'd better get a move on.
As of now, you have no authority here.

00:49.924 --> 00:51.468

01:09.194 --> 01:12.238
Your father is sound asleep.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.698
Ain't nothing waking that man.

01:13.698 --> 01:17.077
I can bang a pot over his head,
he wouldn't be waking up.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.662
Is there a reason you're telling me this?

01:21.498 --> 01:25.418
Just an innocent comment
on your dad's sleeping status. That's all.

01:29.297 --> 01:32.092
It's so peaceful here.
I don't wanna leave.

01:33.885 --> 01:38.306
Two days gone, and that detention center
has literally faded from my memory.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.601
We made the right choice, right?

01:45.605 --> 01:46.606
We certainly did.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.695
Now, are you coming to bed, or what?

01:53.446 --> 01:56.199

But I just had to do it.

- I let my anger win.
- Ben!

02:36.865 --> 02:41.161
- No, it's all my fault. I couldn't stop.
- Ben, stop doing this to yourself!

We don't have Callings anymore.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.355
- Upstairs is all clear.
- I don't think anyone else saw us come in.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.317
Hey, Eden. I bet you missed your stuffies.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.861
Why don't you go to your room
and find one of your favorites?

03:18.948 --> 03:20.700
So, where is he?

03:20.700 --> 03:24.329
Grandpa? There's no sign of him.
But the upstairs has been tossed too.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.872
And I found this.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.125
They were looking for something.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.210
Or someone.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.297
- Okay, we need to get out of here, fast.
- Yeah, but where?

03:34.297 --> 03:37.800
I don't know, but everything
is so messed up right now.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.512
I mean, why wouldn't Grandpa show up
at the meeting place or call?

03:41.512 --> 03:43.723
It's not like him
to just bail on us like that.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.809
Well, maybe he left when the DC came by,
and he'll show up here soon.

03:46.809 --> 03:50.730
I don't know, but I'm gonna go ask Dad.
See if he knows something.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.440
We're gonna see Daddy?

03:54.317 --> 03:57.654
I can stay and wait for Grandpa.
Just hurry.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.616
Okay, we're gonna go see Daddy,

04:01.616 --> 04:04.994

You really like your tomato soup, huh?

05:51.517 --> 05:53.978
It's just the dipping sauce
for the main course,

05:53.978 --> 05:56.272

05:56.272 --> 05:57.231

13:59.421 --> 14:00.756
[alarm blares]

14:04.009 --> 14:05.010
I have to go.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.012
Go. Be with your family.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.598
[sentimental music plays]

14:22.111 --> 14:23.988
- Vance.
- [Vance] Yeah.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.367
Find my kids.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.079
Tell them I love 'em.
Make sure they find Mick.

14:33.163 --> 14:34.081
I will.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.473
Back at the detention center,
you asked why you should trust me.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.017
Now it's my turn.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.979
I'm not gonna try to pretend
to be something that I'm not.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.606
You're too smart for that.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.066
You know I'm an opportunist.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.569
Gotta be to survive in this world.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.654
But I go with the best bet.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.489
My money's on you.

15:09.325 --> 15:10.659
So you're just using me.

15:11.201 --> 15:15.623
[scoffs] No, Sister Christian.
The time has come for you to use me.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.005
Here's the thing.

15:23.881 --> 15:24.840
I can help you.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.177
With what?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.220
Getting them to listen.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.432
See, you're not speaking their language.

15:34.099 --> 15:37.603
You might have the power of sapphire,
but I have the gift of gab.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.730
You need to connect with them.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.524
Remind them you're flawed, just like them.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.611
Like Autumn,
who lost custody of her daughter.

15:46.403 --> 15:48.572
Or Paul, who used to abuse his wife.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.284
Okay, that's right.
Jesus didn't eat with the Pharisees.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.370
He was a friend to the sinners.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.831
I have all of Ben's passenger boards
up here, which means

15:57.831 --> 16:01.877
I have all the information you need
on all us sinners from Flight 828.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.755
I can help you connect with them,

16:04.755 --> 16:09.259
which would help us not get kicked out
into the big, bad world.

16:15.015 --> 16:17.351
[alarm blaring]

16:18.936 --> 16:21.563
Olive, what are you doing inside?
You have to get out now.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.733
No, I can't. Eden is in here somewhere.

16:24.733 --> 16:25.734
Eden?

16:26.986 --> 16:30.531
The doors are closing in seconds.
Anyone still in here is not getting out.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.952
Ben will find Eden,
but you have time to leave. Now come on.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.496
No! I've been on the outside for too long.

16:39.081 --> 16:41.875
I've already missed five years
with my dad,

16:41.875 --> 16:44.003
and I don't know how much time
there is left.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.338
I understand.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.642
Please, please tell Cal I'm sorry.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.522
And just make sure he's okay on his own.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.575
That is okay.

17:15.909 --> 17:18.871
Dad, you're getting stronger
every single day though. You are.

17:19.747 --> 17:24.293
Remember when I was little,
and I really wanted to make this campfire.

17:24.293 --> 17:28.797
And I kept trying and trying and trying,
and I was about to give up.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.799
Then there was this little flicker.

17:30.799 --> 17:34.094
So you grabbed this newspaper,
and the whole thing lit.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.805
And you said, "See?"

17:36.805 --> 17:38.849
"All you need is a little spark."

17:41.310 --> 17:44.188
All you need is a little spark, Dad.
You're gonna get it back.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.856
I promise.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.984
[Jared] Fuel incoming.

17:50.319 --> 17:53.155
[Michaela] Hey, I am genuinely impressed.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.282
You see how I cut off the crust?

17:55.282 --> 17:58.077
I mean, bam! You got
a regular Bobby Flay over here.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.455
I don't think Bobby Flay says "bam,"
but it's fine.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.500
Okay, whatever. Point is
I made some sustenance for my lady,

18:04.500 --> 18:06.919
and I only burned myself once
in doing so, so...

18:06.919 --> 18:09.880
Well, I think that's the most action
you're gonna see up here

18:09.880 --> 18:13.383
'cause there's no perps to bust,
no doors to break down.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.053
Well, that's a good thing, right?

18:16.637 --> 18:17.721
[sighs]

18:18.347 --> 18:19.181
Right?

18:22.226 --> 18:24.603
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

18:26.271 --> 18:27.356
About leaving?

18:30.067 --> 18:31.110
About all of it.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.073
Jay, I'm genuinely happy
being up here with you.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.243
This feels like the life we could've had

18:39.243 --> 18:41.620
if the plane had landed
when it was supposed to.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.248
Then what is it?

18:45.374 --> 18:46.208
Hmm?

18:46.959 --> 18:48.627
I know you, Mick. Something's up.

18:52.756 --> 18:53.799
I'm lost.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.637
The last couple days,
I've been distracting myself,

18:58.637 --> 19:00.222
but without the Callings,

19:01.056 --> 19:03.767
I don't feel like
I have a purpose anymore.

19:04.601 --> 19:05.477
I get it.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.440
Look, I don't know
what's gonna happen next,

19:10.440 --> 19:13.318
but I can guarantee
you and I will figure it out together.

19:14.361 --> 19:15.696
Yeah, we will.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.994
- [man] Think they're coming back?
- [man 2] They're not.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.162
[woman] We're gonna starve.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.914
They can't just leave us here to die.
That's crazy!

19:25.914 --> 19:28.083
If they wanted to kill us,
they could shoot us.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.002
[man 3] I'm gonna stay right here.

19:30.002 --> 19:34.173
Ben. Come on, man. What do you think?
Really.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.259
I don't know.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.761
[doors buzzing]

19:44.516 --> 19:46.518
[mysterious music plays]

19:51.481 --> 19:52.816
[woman 2] Okay, let's go.

19:55.402 --> 19:56.528
[Olive] TJ?

19:59.781 --> 20:00.616
Olive?

20:01.575 --> 20:02.534
TJ!

20:05.204 --> 20:06.038
Olive!

20:08.457 --> 20:09.333
- Olive.
- Dad.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.669
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm sorry.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.338
Where's Eden?

20:14.338 --> 20:15.505
I'm sorry.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.009
- When the earthquake hit, she ran away.
- What?

20:19.009 --> 20:21.386
But she's here. She's here.
We just have to go look for her.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.013
Okay. All right.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.932
- Let's find her. Come on. Come on.
- [TJ] Yeah.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.353
[knocking]

20:29.853 --> 20:32.022
Are Olive and Eden okay?
They should've been back by now.

20:32.022 --> 20:32.981
They're safe.

20:32.981 --> 20:33.941
Thank God.

20:34.858 --> 20:35.817
Where are they?

20:35.817 --> 20:38.320
At the detention center with your father.

20:39.029 --> 20:40.739
I don't understand.
Why are they still there?

20:42.366 --> 20:44.743
A fissure opened up at the DC.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.205
Swallowed Daly's body
and some guards along with him.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.458
Director Zimmer cleared the facility
of all staff and guards.

20:51.458 --> 20:55.504
Then they permanently locked the doors
with Olive and Eden inside.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.631
[somber music plays]

20:57.631 --> 21:00.175
So they're trapped in there?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.094
They made a choice.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.597
They wanted to be inside with your father.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.308
Hopefully, it won't last long.

21:08.308 --> 21:12.771
Olive, she wanted me to tell you "sorry,"
and make sure you're okay out here.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.195
- So I'm alone.
- No, you got me.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.239
Thanks.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.908
But what about your family?

21:26.201 --> 21:29.538
My boys are with Estelle
down in Florida. It's okay.

21:30.038 --> 21:31.206
They're safe.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.918
And I'm gonna make sure you're safe too.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.464
- Have you heard from your aunt?
- Aunt Mick? No.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.591
She and Jared left the DC.

21:41.591 --> 21:44.094
Hunt's on for them,
so they must be laying low.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.762
Don't worry about them.

21:45.762 --> 21:49.474
They know what they're doing.
She'll... She'll reach out as soon as...

22:05.073 --> 22:08.452
- Was that a--
- A Calling, yeah. I saw some cards and--

22:08.452 --> 22:11.913
But that is impossible.
Nobody has Callings anymore.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.040
What do you mean?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.876
Angelina blew them out
of all the passengers

22:15.876 --> 22:17.794
with this terrible scream.

22:18.462 --> 22:22.424
Cal, if you still have Callings,
you're the only one.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.926
[mysterious music plays]

22:29.139 --> 22:30.515

This place is finally occupied.

I'm Tom. I, uh, live down the road.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.247
Oh yeah, that's right. Distinctive.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.458
My ex had it put in.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.710
Jared, nice to meet you.

22:59.961 --> 23:02.589
Honey balsamic chicken.
From the Instant Pot.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.802
You're not a vegetarian, pescatarian,
whatever-hell-atarian, are you?

23:07.386 --> 23:10.847
No. Honey chicken sounds delicious.
Thank you very much. It's kind of you.

23:10.847 --> 23:12.391
Of course. Of course.

23:12.974 --> 23:16.019
You know, in this neighborhood,
we look after each other.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.482
A few years back, a bunch of 828ers
killed the guy who lived here before.

23:21.149 --> 23:24.736
Killed a cop too.
This place has been empty ever since.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.196
Mmm.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.574
- Is that how it happened?
- That's what I heard.

23:31.076 --> 23:34.955
Anyway, if you need anything to settle in,
you know where to find me.

23:34.955 --> 23:38.083
Cat mailbox. Got it. Thanks again.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.587
[foreboding music swells]

23:43.296 --> 23:45.215
Make it quick.
It's almost time for you to go.

23:45.215 --> 23:47.676
Easy. Easy.

23:47.676 --> 23:50.011
I know you're anxious
to get on with your busy day

23:50.011 --> 23:52.389
of huddling in the dark.

23:54.808 --> 23:56.351
Tough crowd. Uh...

23:56.977 --> 23:59.855
Look, we all know I'm no saint,

23:59.855 --> 24:03.191
and I've had my own fair share of issues
with Angelina, believe me.

24:03.191 --> 24:04.818
I get what you're feeling.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.946
But I've changed my mind about her.

24:07.946 --> 24:11.950
And if you give her five minutes,
I think you'll understand why.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.836
I... I know what you've all heard about me,

24:23.587 --> 24:26.131
and I understand why
you might want me gone.

24:26.965 --> 24:31.636
I'm a broken and flawed human being.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.097
I've made mistakes,

24:34.097 --> 24:37.851
but let ye who is without sin
cast the first stone.

24:40.395 --> 24:44.274
Eagan, uh, you lied about being an orphan.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.985
You used the Callings for your own gain.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.529
Constantly putting yourself
in front of others.

24:53.074 --> 24:55.535
Paul, your wife is so fearful of you,

24:55.535 --> 24:58.371
she went into hiding
after our flight landed.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.709
Autumn, sadly, your arrest record means

25:02.709 --> 25:05.128
that your daughter might never know
her real mother.

25:05.128 --> 25:09.424
And I hesitate to share
what I know about you, Astrid.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.594
I would hate to trigger
your crippling anxiety.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.722
But we are all flawed.

25:15.722 --> 25:17.724
We have all made mistakes.

25:19.601 --> 25:22.229
But luckily,
the Lord uses the least of these.

25:23.980 --> 25:25.524
But if you don't believe that,

25:26.608 --> 25:28.026
maybe you'll believe this.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.786
We all know the world will end June 2nd.

25:38.745 --> 25:42.707
But God has chosen me to guide the worthy
through the final judgment.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.335
To usher in a new world.

25:46.044 --> 25:49.339
I can lead you to salvation,
for he has shown me the way.

25:49.965 --> 25:51.216
And I can show you...

25:53.760 --> 25:55.053
if you'll have me.

we'd have eyes on the whole place.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.294
It's okay. I have Jolene.

It's her doll's name.

And I will be naming
my first gray hair after you!

- It'll be okay.
- Yeah.

27:31.566 --> 27:32.776
Queen of clubs.

27:32.776 --> 27:35.320
Uh, yeah.
Like a little club of all the queens.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.738
Wow.

27:36.738 --> 27:37.781
Never mind.

27:38.281 --> 27:41.534
[Cal] Okay, but instead
of the "Q" in the corner, I saw numbers.

27:41.534 --> 27:44.663
A six, two, three, and an eight.

27:44.663 --> 27:48.625
They were like that.
And in the Calling, I couldn't breathe.

27:50.168 --> 27:53.797
There's an Every Queen Cooling company
that services the detention center.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.757
Their logo looks just like that.

27:55.757 --> 27:59.427
Boom! We just need to go to their offices
and see what we can find out.

27:59.427 --> 28:00.345
Have we met?

28:00.345 --> 28:02.847

28:07.018 --> 28:09.729
Boom. A list of every van schedule
for the month.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.981
NSA, what!

28:11.981 --> 28:14.109
- No.
- Okay, sorry.

28:14.109 --> 28:17.237
You're the only one with Callings now,
so this one must be important.

28:17.237 --> 28:18.238
Right. What do we got?

28:19.781 --> 28:21.866
Every Queen Cooling tracks their vans.

28:21.866 --> 28:25.912
Not only can we see their location,
but speed, how many stops were made...

28:25.912 --> 28:28.331
- Kind of freaky.
- You don't know the half of it, kid.

28:28.331 --> 28:32.127
Wait, stop right there.
Six, two, three, eight. That's our van.

28:32.127 --> 28:36.172
And it's scheduled to make a service call
to the detention center tomorrow.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.426
That's strange.
Why is it so far out of its service zone?

28:39.426 --> 28:40.760
That's a trek.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.638
Uh, don't worry.
I got a sick road trip playlist.

28:43.638 --> 28:46.766
- You like dubstep, right?
- It's my favorite kind of step.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.023
[Jared] All clean?

28:54.023 --> 28:58.111
He is. Next time you get to tap in
at the finish line.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.112
Come here.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.745
Honestly, it's a lot harder
than I thought it would be,

29:06.745 --> 29:08.079
seeing him like this.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.000
I wonder if it's more than we can handle.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.503
The important stuff's never easy, Mick.

29:17.005 --> 29:17.881
Yeah.

29:19.883 --> 29:23.219
Uh, did you order takeout
after the grilled cheese fiasco?

29:24.179 --> 29:26.973
You are such a quitter. Oh my goodness.

29:26.973 --> 29:30.059
No, that is a welcome dish
from our neighbor.

29:30.059 --> 29:33.897
You would've got a kick out of this guy.
Then you would've kicked his ass.

He had some skewed story
about what happened here.

The 828 misinformation
is out of control, Jared.

29:46.117 --> 29:49.329

we could prove that we were doing good.

No, we didn't.
We haven't hurt or killed anyone, Quinn.

Yikes. Good thing he can't
get into the detention center.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.617
He doesn't need to. His job is
to access the exterior of the building

32:32.617 --> 32:36.371

get anywhere near there.

40:21.669 --> 40:25.464
If we get our Callings back.
What that means for the Lifeboat.

40:28.134 --> 40:33.055
And I know most of us
don't have family in here.

40:35.224 --> 40:36.559
But I also know this.

40:37.893 --> 40:43.357
Every single passenger in this place
has become family.

40:45.985 --> 40:50.489
No matter how hopeless it feels at times,
we still have each other.

40:53.868 --> 40:57.037
Now we have nine months left

40:58.914 --> 41:01.917
to find little ways
to make every last second count.

41:02.418 --> 41:04.420
To the little joys in life.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.393
Okay, let's do this!

41:20.519 --> 41:23.898
Uh, anyone with a specialized skill,
form a group to my right.

41:23.898 --> 41:25.566
Uh, to my left,

41:25.566 --> 41:29.278
we need volunteers to take stock
of whatever food we can find.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.780
And right here up front,

41:31.780 --> 41:35.326
let's see if we can
change this place around.

41:35.951 --> 41:38.037
- Make this place a home.
- [man] Yeah!

41:38.037 --> 41:39.079
Our home.

[Michaela]
Okay, I am. I'm trying to stay positive,

41:48.964 --> 41:53.135
but with the new isolation protocols
and with Olive and Eden in there too--

41:53.135 --> 41:55.763
At least Cal still gets Callings.

41:56.639 --> 41:57.598
It's huge.

41:57.598 --> 42:00.976
Well, I think it's my sapphire.
It must be.

42:00.976 --> 42:02.770
Maybe it somehow protected me

42:02.770 --> 42:05.898
when Angelina's scream
made everyone else's Callings disappear?

42:06.524 --> 42:07.358
I wonder--

42:08.859 --> 42:09.818
You wonder what?

42:11.946 --> 42:13.531
Wonder if the Callings aren't gone,

42:13.531 --> 42:16.408
but if people just can't
receive them anymore.

42:16.408 --> 42:20.621
Wait, you mean like if Angelina just
blew your antennas or something?

42:20.621 --> 42:25.042
Yes. If they're still out there somewhere,
then maybe with your sapphire--

42:25.042 --> 42:28.045
I could go on the plane and access
other people's Callings for them.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.422
Like I did with Joe and Bethany.

42:30.422 --> 42:34.218
But, Cal... Look, it could be dangerous.
Everything has changed.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.845
You don't know what'll happen
if you try again.

42:36.845 --> 42:39.306
Well, I'm already in danger. We all are.

42:39.306 --> 42:40.474
It's worth a shot.

You all right?

43:20.180 --> 43:22.683
Cal, if it didn't work, it's okay.
It's not your fault.

43:24.518 --> 43:26.061
I didn't get a Calling.

43:26.937 --> 43:28.188
I got all of them.

43:28.939 --> 43:31.191
You were right, Aunt Mick.
They're all still out there.

43:31.191 --> 43:34.111
I got every passenger's Calling
all at once.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.696
[panting]

43:35.696 --> 43:38.198
But if I can focus,

43:38.198 --> 43:40.576
if I can dig them out one at a time--

43:40.576 --> 43:42.411
Then we can still help solve the Callings.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.997
Giving you the chance
to survive the Death Date.

43:44.997 --> 43:46.540
A chance is enough.
