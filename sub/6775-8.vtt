SO YOU'RE BACK
FROM OUTER SPACE

02:57.230 --> 02:58.959

02:58.960 --> 03:02.088
THAT LOOK
UPON YOUR FACE

03:02.100 --> 03:03.658
AH!

03:03.660 --> 03:06.151
I AM SUCH
A FUCKING IDIOT !

03:06.160 --> 03:08.822
I SHOULD'VE DUMPED HIM
YEARS AGO.

03:08.830 --> 03:11.799
I FEEL
20 POUNDS LIGHTER.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.496
MORE LIKE
180 POUNDS.

03:15.900 --> 03:17.856
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S DOING TONIGHT ?

03:17.860 --> 03:20.192
OH, HE'S FUCKING HIS
LITTLE GRAD STUDENT.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.997
THINKING HE'S KING
OF THE WORLD !

03:22.000 --> 03:25.925
GOD, I WISH I KNEW
WHO INVENTED VIAGRA.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.557
SO, I COULD
SHOOT HIM.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.357
I'LL DRINK
TO THAT.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.622
HEAR, HEAR !

03:30.630 --> 03:32.598
OH, SHIT, IT FELL
DOWN MY SHIRT.

HOLD THIS, HOLD THIS,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

03:34.460 --> 03:35.495

03:45.430 --> 03:47.819
( laughing )

03:50.060 --> 03:51.095
PROMISE ME,

03:51.100 --> 03:52.749
NO DANCING ON

04:47.860 --> 04:50.852
YOU MUST REALLY LIKE
WEARING A SUIT.

04:50.860 --> 04:53.055
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE
WE MIGHT GET A WALK-IN.

04:53.060 --> 04:56.029
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE
WE MIGHT GET ABDUCTED BY ALIENS.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.591
WHAT'S THE LONGEST WE'VE
EVER GONE WITHOUT A BODY ?

05:03.600 --> 05:07.092
I REMEMBER DAD SAYING

05:17.830 --> 05:19.320

05:22.730 --> 05:24.925
OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU FOR
MAKING ME FEEL LIKE AN IDIOT.

05:24.930 --> 05:26.352
NO, I JUST...

05:26.360 --> 05:28.999
YOU KNEW A WHOLE SIDE
OF DAD I NEVER DID.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.928

ONCE A YEAR, YOU KNOW ?

06:07.000 --> 06:08.797
TWICE AT THE MOST.

TO FIGURE OUT.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.720

PISSED OFF WHEN I CAN'T.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.754
IT'S FUCKING
NEUROTIC !

THAT SORT OF THING.

09:08.860 --> 09:10.020
ARE YOU INSANE ?

09:10.030 --> 09:12.248
DRUNKS AND DRUG ADDICTS
INSIDE OUR HOME ?

09:12.260 --> 09:13.625

ISSUES ALONE.

09:13.630 --> 09:15.427
WELL, THEN HOW ABOUT
SENIOR DANCE LESSONS ?

09:15.430 --> 09:17.318
TWICE A WEEK AT
50 BUCKS A POP.

09:17.330 --> 09:18.797
THAT'S $5200 A YEAR,

PROPERTY TAX.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.092
WHAT IF WE'VE
GOT A VIEWING ?

09:21.100 --> 09:23.091
THEY WORK AROUND
OUR SCHEDULE.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.590
DAVID, THESE OLD PEOPLE
HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.158
THEY DANCE HERE TWICE
A WEEK, HAVE FUN.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.458
WHO DO YOU THINK GETS
THE CALL WHEN THEY DROP ?

09:28.460 --> 09:30.849
THAT'S ACTUALLY
NOT A BAD IDEA.

09:30.860 --> 09:32.327
WELL, GOOD, BECAUSE
THEY'RE COMING HERE AT TWO.

09:32.330 --> 09:34.093
SO, NO MORE COMMENTS
ABOUT ME NOT PULLING MY WEIGHT

09:34.100 --> 09:36.022
FOR A WHILE,
OKAY ?

09:43.030 --> 09:45.225
SO, IS THIS A NEW
COMPANY POLICY,
CASUAL FRIDAYS ?

09:45.230 --> 09:47.448
NICE OF YOU TO DROP BY,

ONE LAST WEEK.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.724
THEY JUST WANT TO
DO ANOTHER ONE.

09:58.730 --> 10:01.358
I THINK I SHOULD BE THERE
WITH HER, DON'T YOU ?

10:01.360 --> 10:02.657
WELL, OF COURSE,
YOU COULD'VE JUST CALLED.

10:02.660 --> 10:04.298
I LEFT MY JACKET
IN THE PREP ROOM.

10:04.300 --> 10:07.053

10:18.930 --> 10:20.352
IT'S FISHER & SONS.

10:20.360 --> 10:22.248
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
BE THE BAD COP.

10:22.260 --> 10:24.626
WELL, YOU'RE SO
GOOD AT IT.

10:24.630 --> 10:26.291

ON MY MIND

10:47.760 --> 10:49.421
WITH THE ULTRASOUND
AND ALL, YOU KNOW ?

10:49.430 --> 10:51.057
DAVID WANTS YOU

10:51.060 --> 10:52.857
THE WALK-IN,
I KNOW, I KNOW.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.192
YOUR BROTHER'S GOT A BUG
UP HIS ASS ABOUT CLEANLINESS.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.953
I KNOW, WHEN WE USED TO
PLAY G-I JOES

10:57.960 --> 10:59.928
HE ALWAYS WANTED TO
GIVE HIS A SHOWER.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.119
YEAH, WELL.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.791
I'M RUNNING LATE.

PART OF OUR JOURNEY.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.594
OH, GREAT, NOW WE GET TO
STARVE AND SWEAT OURSELVES

11:31.600 --> 11:34.319
INTO A HALLUCINOGENIC
STATE OF ECSTASY.

11:34.330 --> 11:35.752
IT'S GONNA GET
HARDER AND HARDER

11:35.760 --> 11:36.988

COUPLE OF DAYS.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.355

HOW TOUGH PHYSICALLY.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.397

CHALLENGES BEGIN.

WAITING FOR ?

12:05.460 --> 12:06.688

12:24.630 --> 12:26.655
SANDY BULLOCK
OR JULIA ROBERTS ?

12:26.660 --> 12:28.753
PLEASE, SHE'D NEVER
RATE THAT HIGH.

12:28.760 --> 12:32.719
SHE'D GET ONE OF THOSE
"BUFFY" OR "DAWSON'S CREEK"
CHICKS, TOPS.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.427
WHAT IS THAT ?

12:36.430 --> 12:37.624
THIS ?

12:37.630 --> 12:39.222
KHINKALI.

12:39.230 --> 12:41.027
IT'S LIKE...

12:41.030 --> 12:45.126
DUMPLING WITH
SPICY MEAT INSIDE.

12:45.130 --> 12:48.952

12:50.760 --> 12:53.320

FROM THE HOUSE MORE.

12:53.330 --> 12:54.422

12:54.430 --> 12:56.125
I TOOK A VERY ENJOYABLE TRIP
TO SAN BERNADINO

12:56.130 --> 12:57.757
JUST A FEW

12:57.760 --> 12:59.159
YOU SHOULD COME TO
MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.889
ALL RUSSIAN.

13:02.030 --> 13:04.692

13:04.700 --> 13:06.156
NOT LIKE YOUR FAMILY.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.229
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

13:07.230 --> 13:09.755
RUSSIANS SPEAK FROM HERE,
FROM THE HEART,

13:09.760 --> 13:11.159

13:11.160 --> 13:14.049

IN RUSSIA,

13:18.830 --> 13:20.923

THE FIRST FLIGHT BACK.

13:20.930 --> 13:24.457

15:42.400 --> 15:43.526
YOU'RE GONNA STAND

15:43.530 --> 15:45.953

15:45.960 --> 15:47.848
YOUR OTHER HAND IS GONNA GO

15:47.860 --> 15:50.749

I DON'T THINK SO.

16:54.060 --> 16:55.925
SOMEBODY BURNED DOWN
THE FUNERAL HOME

16:55.930 --> 16:58.148
KROEHNER WAS BUILDING
ACROSS THE STREET.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.422

17:02.830 --> 17:04.252
OH, SORRY,

17:04.260 --> 17:05.818
I'M JEWISH,
I CAN SAY THAT.

17:05.830 --> 17:08.822
KROEHNER BURNED DOWN
THEIR OWN BUILDING

17:08.830 --> 17:10.422
FOR THE INSURANCE MONEY ?

17:10.430 --> 17:11.920

17:28.000 --> 17:29.752

17:29.760 --> 17:32.320
I'M KURT,

18:14.900 --> 18:17.653

18:23.400 --> 18:25.220
OKAY,
DON'T SAY GAYDAR.

18:25.230 --> 18:28.893
I'D SURE WISH WE COULD
LIGHT UP THAT JOINT.

18:28.900 --> 18:31.721
YEAH, DENNIS IS WATCHING
US LIKE A HAWK.

18:31.730 --> 18:34.324
NOW THAT WE'VE OFFICIALLY
ESTABLISHED OURSELVES

18:34.330 --> 18:35.991
AS THE ANTISOCIAL
LOSERS.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.322
WE'LL JUST SNEAK OFF
AFTER WE SET UP CAMP.

18:39.330 --> 18:42.299
WHILE THE REST OF THE BUSH YOUTH

THE SAME SCHOOL.

18:55.060 --> 18:56.652
WE'RE NOT
EXACTLY FRIENDS.

18:56.660 --> 18:59.254
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
ENEMIES, EITHER.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.693
WE HAVE

19:38.060 --> 19:40.449
I SHOULD'VE HAD
YOUR WORK VIDEOTAPED.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.792
THESE LESSER LIGHTS
COULD LEARN FROM YOU.

19:42.800 --> 19:44.950
I HAVE A LOT

19:44.960 --> 19:46.848
ANY INTEREST

22:09.260 --> 22:11.148
OH, I'M NOT ROOTING HER,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.492
NO, SHE MADE IT QUITE CLEAR
THAT WASN'T AN OPTION.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.525
HER HEART'S GOT
YOUR NAME ON IT NOW.

22:15.530 --> 22:17.521
NO, THAT WOULD

23:50.030 --> 23:52.089

24:17.100 --> 24:18.556
CONNOR'S COOKING SOME
AUSTRALIAN THING

24:18.560 --> 24:19.697

24:30.400 --> 24:32.925
I FUCKED UP.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.625
OKAY ?

24:38.860 --> 24:40.953
I'VE BEEN UNDER
A LITTLE PRESSURE LATELY.

24:40.960 --> 24:44.020
WITH MY BROTHER HAVING
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN
AND EVERYTHING,

24:44.030 --> 24:47.591
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO SIMPLIFY THINGS.

24:49.630 --> 24:53.122
DON'T BLOW THIS OUT OF
PROPORTION, PLEASE, NATE.

24:57.500 --> 24:58.990

25:18.130 --> 25:19.449
TOPHER ?

AH!

25:36.260 --> 25:37.488
OH, SHIT !

25:37.500 --> 25:39.821
LOOK, LOOK.

25:39.830 --> 25:42.253
IF SHE TELLS ANYBODY,
NO ONE WILL BELIEVE HER.

25:42.260 --> 25:44.649
EVERYBODY THINKS
SHE'S LIKE, CRAZY.

25:46.730 --> 25:49.597
The sexual _habits of the koala
are qUIte mysterious

25:49.600 --> 25:52.091
because of their complicated
reproductive systems.

25:52.100 --> 25:56.525
The male koala's penis is
forked like a snake's tongue.

25:56.530 --> 25:59.852
The female has two vaginas
which share a common opening.

25:59.860 --> 26:01.555
WHATCHA WATCHIN' ?

26:01.560 --> 26:04.996

WHAT'S UP ?

26:08.230 --> 26:10.949
I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.793
I CALLED VANESSA AND THERE'S
NO ULTRASOUND TODAY.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.121
AND I ALSO THINK RICO TOOK
A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF STUFF

26:16.130 --> 26:17.620
FROM THE PREP ROOM.

26:17.630 --> 26:19.552
SHIT !

26:19.560 --> 26:22.051
FUCKING KROEHNER.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.750
ALRIGHT, I'LL CALL AROUND,
SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.227
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THIS EARLIER ?

26:27.230 --> 26:29.858
I WAS GOING TO, BUT I GOT
DISTRACT ED BY YOU

26:29.860 --> 26:31.327

26:33.600 --> 26:35.397
LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE RICO
HAS AN EXCLUSIVE CONTRACT

26:35.400 --> 26:36.697
WITH US
OR ANYTHING.

26:36.700 --> 26:38.122
SO, HE'S MOONLIGHTING.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.451
MOONLIGHTING IS WHEN
YOU TAKE A JOB
WHEN YOUR FIRST JOB IS OVER.

26:40.460 --> 26:42.189
WHEN HE TAKES A JOB
FOR GILARDI

26:42.200 --> 26:44.293
WHILE HE'S STILL ON THE CLOCK
WITH US, IT'S TREASON.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.858
STOP BEING SUCH
A DRAMA QUEEN.

26:45.860 --> 26:47.896
STOP ACTING LIKE YOU'RE
HONORARY MAYOR OF WEST HOLLYWOOD

26:47.900 --> 26:49.527
ALL OF A SUDDEN.

26:53.800 --> 26:56.098
HE LIED TO
OUR FACES.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.549
YEAH, HE DID.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.452
HEY, CLAIRE.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.894
HEY.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.493
LOOK, I'M SORRY

27:13.500 --> 27:15.092
I THOUGHT YOU
AND TOPHER--

27:15.100 --> 27:16.249
IT'S OKAY.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.591
WHATEVER, IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.795
NO, IT'S OKAY,
I JUST, I DON'T KNOW.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.826
I HOPE YOU WON'T JUST
WRITE ME OFF KNOW.

27:22.830 --> 27:24.388
I MEAN,

27:24.400 --> 27:26.550
MAYBE IT'LL EVEN LIKE,
BREAK THE ICE.

27:28.360 --> 27:29.896
YEAH.

27:33.730 --> 27:36.699
I JUST KINDA THINK
YOU'RE FUNNY AND COOL.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.850
AND WELL,
SOMETIMES

27:38.860 --> 27:40.896
I FEEL BORING
AND LAME AROUND YOU.

27:40.900 --> 27:44.154
AND I THINK THAT'S 'CAUSE,
I DON'T KNOW,

27:44.160 --> 27:46.355
I KIN DA WANT TO
BE YOUR FRIEND.

27:47.660 --> 27:49.196
( laughing )

27:52.600 --> 27:54.227
WHY ?

27:54.230 --> 27:56.357
WHY NOT ?

28:00.100 --> 28:03.149
OKAY, BUT THIS
IS TOTALLY WEIRD.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.397
HOW'S VANESSA ?

28:23.400 --> 28:25.823
SHE'S GREAT.

28:26.860 --> 28:27.997
YEAH.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.888
THE BABY'S STRONG
AS A BOUNCER.

28:29.900 --> 28:31.492
HOW'S CHLOE YORKIN ?

28:31.500 --> 28:35.152
SOME OF YOUR MORE ARDENT FANS
IN PREP ROOMS AROUND L.A.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.856
ARE CALLING THIS ONE
YOUR SISTINE CHAPEL.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.159
LOOK...

28:43.160 --> 28:45.390
I TOLD GILARDI IT WAS
A ONE-TIME THING.

28:45.400 --> 28:49.427
I MEAN, COME ON, GUYS,
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND.

28:49.430 --> 28:51.057
IT WASN'T
FOR THE MONEY.

28:51.060 --> 28:53.699
R HEAD
WAS LIKE A...

28:53.700 --> 28:56.498
LIKE A WATERMELON SOMEBODY
HIT WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER.

28:56.500 --> 29:00.129
I MEAN, A CASE LIKE THAT
DOESN'T COME ALONG EVERY DAY.

29:00.130 --> 29:01.927
WHAT DID HE OFFER
YOU TO LEAVE ?

29:04.130 --> 29:06.394
WHAT ARE YOU
OFFERING ME TO STAY ?

29:11.160 --> 29:12.696
WHAT ?

29:13.800 --> 29:16.519
YOU GUYS THOUGHT I WOULD
STAY OUT OF LOYALTY ?

29:17.900 --> 29:20.858
UNLIKE YOU TWO, I HAVE A WIFE
AND KIDS TO THINK ABOUT.

29:20.860 --> 29:23.021
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

29:23.030 --> 29:26.193
I WANT TO
BE A PARTNER.

29:26.200 --> 29:27.792
THAT WOULD REQUIRE
A SIGNIFICANT

29:27.800 --> 29:29.927
FINANCIAL INVESTMENT
ON YOUR PART.

29:32.030 --> 29:34.123
THAT'S WHAT
PARTNERS ARE.

29:36.330 --> 29:37.797
RICO, LET DAVID
AND ME TALK.

29:37.800 --> 29:40.155
DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL WE HAVE
A CHANCE TO COUNTER, OKAY ?

29:43.760 --> 29:44.727
OKAY.

29:52.800 --> 29:55.951
MAYBE WE CAN WORK OUT SOME
SORT OF PROFIT SHARING PLAN.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.428
HE'S FINALLY FIGURED OUT HE'S
WORTH MORE THAN WE CAN PAY HIM.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.897
WE'RE FUCKED.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.422
( male )
OKAY,

30:03.430 --> 30:05.921
TODAY, WE'RE GONNA
CLIMB ABOUT 3,000 FEET,

30:05.930 --> 30:08.956
TO A SHELTER
CLOSE TO THE SUMMIT.

30:08.960 --> 30:10.996
NOW WE HAVE
TO MOVE FAST,

30:11.000 --> 30:13.798
BECAUSE WHEN IT GETS DARK,
IT GETS COLD.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.449
WHY DID YOU
SLEEP WITH HIM ?

30:15.460 --> 30:16.757
I DON'T KNOW.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.625
JUST TO SEE
IF I COULD.

30:20.460 --> 30:22.724
SO, WHO HASN'T
BEEN LEADER YET ?

30:23.930 --> 30:26.558
( male )
I HAVEN'T.

30:27.660 --> 30:28.922
CLAIRE.

30:28.930 --> 30:30.989
WHAT ?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.252
WHICH WAY
DO WE GO ?

30:33.260 --> 30:35.626
I DON'T KNOW,
I REALLY DON'T CARE.

30:37.860 --> 30:39.498
SOMEBODY ELSE PICK.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.128
COME ON, CLAIRE,
DON'T YOU WANT TO CONSULT
YOUR MAP AND COMPASS ?

30:42.130 --> 30:43.825
NO, I THINK I LOST
MY COMPASS ANYWAY.

30:43.830 --> 30:45.798
THEN BORROW ONE
FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

30:47.330 --> 30:50.128
LOOK, JUST PICK
SOMEONE ELSE, OKAY ?

30:50.130 --> 30:51.392
PLEASE.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.929
OKAY, THAT WAY.

30:58.930 --> 31:00.852
I THINK WE SHOULD
GO THAT WAY.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.293
IT'S OBVIOUSLY
THE PATH.

31:02.300 --> 31:03.949
OKAY, MAYBE SOMEONE
ELSE WOULD LIKE TO--

31:03.960 --> 31:06.497
HEY, CLAIRE PAID
HER 1200 BUCKS TOO.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.525
DOESN'T SHE
GET A TURN ?

31:08.530 --> 31:10.157
DON'T PULL ME
INTO YOUR SHIT, OKAY ?

31:15.760 --> 31:17.751
OKAY, LOOK.

31:17.760 --> 31:22.356
LET'S ALL TAKE OUT
OUR MAPS AND COMPASSES--

31:22.360 --> 31:23.952
IT'S CLAIRE'S TURN,
DENNIS.

31:23.960 --> 31:27.293
I THINK WE SHOULD
FOLLOW CLAIRE.

31:27.300 --> 31:30.155
AND SHE SAID
WE SHOULD GO THIS WAY.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.250
OKAY...

31:35.260 --> 31:37.728
THIS WAY IT IS.

31:42.430 --> 31:44.125
THANKS A LOT.

31:44.130 --> 31:45.597

STARTING TO BE FUN.

31:48.630 --> 31:51.554
I PREFER
BUSY TO QUIET.

31:51.560 --> 31:53.221
SOME PEOPLE...

31:53.230 --> 31:56.324

NOTHING TO DO.

31:56.330 --> 31:58.753

THIS RESTAURANT

32:06.600 --> 32:08.659
EVERY DAY WHILE

RESTAURANT.

32:10.530 --> 32:12.953
NO CUSTOMER.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.224
EVERY NIGHT,
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,

32:15.230 --> 32:16.857
NO CUSTOMER.

32:16.860 --> 32:20.023
HOW THEY CAN
MAKE A LIVING ?

32:20.030 --> 32:22.828
I THOUGHT ETHIOPIAN PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE NO FOOD.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.891

34:24.900 --> 34:27.118

ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO WOULD

35:02.300 --> 35:04.655
CREATE A HUGE STINK
AND RUIN MY LIFE

35:04.660 --> 35:06.628
JUST FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT

35:06.630 --> 35:09.121

36:25.560 --> 36:27.118
YOU TOOK POLAROIDS,
RIGHT ?

36:27.130 --> 36:28.427
POLAROIDS.

36:28.430 --> 36:31.593
I BORROWED
JACOB'S DIGITAL CAMERA.

36:35.730 --> 36:39.325
YOU BLENDED THE FILLER MATERIAL
JUST PERFECT.

36:39.330 --> 36:40.456
HONEY,

36:40.460 --> 36:42.928
SHE REALLY IS
YOUR SISTINE CHAPEL.

36:42.930 --> 36:44.921
YOU THINK ?

36:44.930 --> 36:46.454
BABY, YOU KNOW.

36:46.460 --> 36:49.691
TOO BAD YOU
GOTTA BURY HER.

36:49.700 --> 36:51.224
YEAH.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.023
SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL,
DOESN'T SHE ?

36:56.030 --> 36:57.588
NEVER BETTER.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.420
YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN HER YESTERDAY.

37:00.430 --> 37:01.522
YOU GONNA
TAKE THE OFFER.

37:01.530 --> 37:02.929
I HAVEN'T DECIDED.

37:02.930 --> 37:05.296
NO, I SAID YOU'RE
GONNA TAKE THE OFFER.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.928
WHERE WOULD I BE
WITHOUT THE FISHERS ?

37:07.930 --> 37:10.455
IN A HOUSE, NOT SOME
LOUSY APARTMENT.

37:10.460 --> 37:12.451
THEY TREAT YOU LIKE
A MIGRANT WORKER.

37:12.460 --> 37:16.055
THEY'LL NEVER
MAKE ME A PARTNER.

37:16.060 --> 37:18.119
NOT EVER.

37:19.900 --> 37:22.698
$1500 A RESTORATION.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.789
TUITION AT S.C.'s
HIGHWAY ROBBERY, SO...

37:27.800 --> 37:29.950
CALLING HELPS PAY
FOR BOOKS AND BEER.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.689
IT'S EITHER THAT
OR BECOME A BEEPER BOY.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.759
I'M NOT QUITE READY
TO GO THERE.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.820
SO, WHAT'S WITH THE
INTERNATIONAL MALE SHIRT ?

37:36.830 --> 37:39.025
THIS ?
OH, I...

37:40.230 --> 37:42.221
I BORROWED IT
FROM MY SISTER.

37:42.230 --> 37:43.527
IT LOOKS GOOD.

37:43.530 --> 37:45.794
I BET IT LOOKS
EVEN BETTER OFF.

37:51.460 --> 37:54.918
SO, YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT
SQUARE DANCE CALLING...

37:54.930 --> 37:56.795
IT'S MY GRANDPARENTS'
GROUP.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.394
THEY PRACTICALLY RAISED ME
AFTER MY PARENTS KICKED ME OUT.

37:59.400 --> 38:01.721
KICKED YOU OUT ?

38:01.730 --> 38:04.358
WHEN THEY FOUND
OUT ABOUT YOU ?

38:04.360 --> 38:06.351
WHEN MY FATHER WALKED IN ON ME
AND MY HIGH SCHOOL BOYFRIEND

38:06.360 --> 38:08.248
FUCKING ON THE DESK
IN HIS STUDY.

38:08.260 --> 38:10.057
IT WAS AWFUL.

38:10.060 --> 38:11.357
MY MOTHER HAD
A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN,

38:11.360 --> 38:13.624
MY PARENTS
EVENTUALLY SPLIT.

38:13.630 --> 38:16.224
IT WAS A TOTAL MOVIE
FOR "LIFETIME".

38:16.230 --> 38:18.596
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?
WHAT'D YOUR PARENTS DO ?

38:18.600 --> 38:19.999
WHEN I CAME OUT ?

38:20.000 --> 38:22.753
MY DAD WAS
OKAY WITH IT.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.149
MY MOM'S STILL
A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

38:25.160 --> 38:28.027
IT STILL BAFFLES ME THAT ANYONE
EVEN GIVES A SHIT, YOU KNOW ?

38:28.030 --> 38:29.520
HERE YOU GO.

38:30.960 --> 38:31.927
ENJOY.

38:31.930 --> 38:34.194
YOU HAVE
A BOYFRIEND ?

38:34.200 --> 38:35.849
UH, NO.

38:35.860 --> 38:37.293
WHY NOT ?

38:37.300 --> 38:38.528
I'M...

38:38.530 --> 38:40.225
NOT SURE.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.527
YOU EVER
HAVE ONE ?

38:41.530 --> 38:43.953
YEAH, YOU ?

38:43.960 --> 38:45.825
YEAH, SEVERAL.

38:48.430 --> 38:51.922
YOU'VE GOT THE LONGEST
EYELASHES I'VE EVER SEEN.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.153
I'VE ALWAYS
LIKED OLDER GUYS.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.890
I'M THE OLDER GUY.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.197
GUYS MY AGE
ARE IDIOTS.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.225
THEY'RE FUN
TO FUCK, BUT...

39:01.230 --> 39:03.095
IT USUALLY
ENDS THERE.

39:03.100 --> 39:04.658
AND I HATE THE WAY
THEY TREAT OLDER MEN.

39:04.660 --> 39:06.890
TIRED OLD QUEEN,
FOSSIL, TROLL.

39:06.900 --> 39:09.198
AS IF WE'RE NOT GONNA
END UP THERE OURSELVES ONE DAY

39:09.200 --> 39:10.758
IF WE'RE LUCKY.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.454
I'M GETTING MY MASTERS
IN SOCIAL WORK

39:18.100 --> 39:19.658
IT'S A PET PEEVE
OF MINE.

39:19.660 --> 39:21.025
ARE YOU A TOP
OR A BOTTOM ?

39:21.030 --> 39:22.054
WHAT ?

39:24.300 --> 39:27.451
I'M VERSATILE.

39:27.460 --> 39:30.293
BOTTOM, GOOD,
THIS'LL WORK OUT WELL.

39:30.300 --> 39:32.097
YOU WANT TO
GET OUT OF HERE ?

39:33.830 --> 39:35.092
YEAH.

39:38.730 --> 39:41.119
SO, THE BASTARD
CARKED IT.

39:41.130 --> 39:43.348
I LOST MY INVESTMENT,
MY BIKE...

39:43.360 --> 39:44.952
FUCKING EVERYTHING.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.951
CONNOR, THIS ALWAYS
HAPPENS TO YOU.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.598
OH, WELL...

39:48.600 --> 39:50.818
I GUESS I CAN ALWAYS GO BACK
ON THE BANANA ROLL, EH ?

39:52.060 --> 39:54.722
DO YOU REMEMBER,
WHAT WAS THAT...

39:54.730 --> 39:56.721
THAT THING IN TEXAS ?

39:56.730 --> 39:58.254
YOU LOST YOUR
BIKE IN TEXAS !

39:58.260 --> 39:59.488
OH, NOT THAT
FUCKING WOMAN.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.718
YES, IT WAS '95
OR SOMETHING.

40:01.730 --> 40:03.049
WHAT WAS THAT ?

40:03.060 --> 40:03.958
I THOUGHT I WAS
GONNA GET A ROOT.

40:03.960 --> 40:05.325
( laughing )

40:07.760 --> 40:09.819
HEY, NATE.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.292
LISTEN...

40:12.300 --> 40:14.291
I'M SORRY ABOUT
LAST WEEK.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.495
I GO OFF THE MEDS
NOW AND THEN JUST TO...

40:18.500 --> 40:20.855
FEEL ALIVE.

40:20.860 --> 40:24.023
I'M SURE YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT
I WAS A TOTAL PSYCHO.

40:25.260 --> 40:27.751
IT CROSSED
MY MIND.

40:29.430 --> 40:31.523
WELL, I'M NOT.

40:45.630 --> 40:47.996
I DON'T WANT TO COME
BETWEEN YOU AND MY SISTER.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.197
SHE'S HAPPY
WITH YOU.

40:51.200 --> 40:54.499
HAPPIER THAN I'VE SEEN HER
IN A LONG TIME

40:54.500 --> 40:56.752
AND I MEAN THAT.

40:57.930 --> 41:00.091
THAT IS SO TRAGIC.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.919
SO, WHAT'S THE STORY ?

41:03.930 --> 41:06.148
JUST ANOTHER SPUNK TO
ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION ?

41:08.260 --> 41:10.649
WHAT'S THERE LEFT
FOR ME TO DO ?

41:10.660 --> 41:12.628
BECOME AN
AIR HOSTESS ?

41:12.630 --> 41:16.623
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET A TV SHOW
WHERE YOU WRESTLE THINGS, RIGHT,

41:16.630 --> 41:18.951
BUT NOT ANIMALS.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.552
THINGS.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.788
WHAT KIND
OF THINGS ?

41:21.800 --> 41:24.451
LIKE HOUSEHOLD
OBJECTS.

41:24.460 --> 41:26.826
LIKE REFRIGERATORS.

41:27.500 --> 41:30.298
( Brenda )
AND HERE'S THE TITLE
OF IT, RIGHT,

41:30.300 --> 41:32.996
"A SANDWICH
SHORT OF A PICNIC."

41:33.000 --> 41:34.058
( laughing )

41:34.060 --> 41:35.618
JUST THE WAY
I LIKE IT TOO.

41:35.630 --> 41:38.349
"HEY, CALLER,
WHAT'S YOUR JOHN DORY ?"

41:38.360 --> 41:42.399
WHAT FUCKING LANGUAGE
ARE YOU SPEAKING ?

41:44.200 --> 41:46.259
NATE, BUDDY.

41:46.260 --> 41:47.659
CHILL.

41:55.100 --> 41:58.695
THIS CAR IS LIKE TOTAL
GRACELAND ON WHEELS.

41:58.700 --> 42:01.191
TOTAL LOVE NEST.

42:01.200 --> 42:03.555
HAVE YOU EVER
FUCKED IN HERE ?

42:03.560 --> 42:05.653
ONCE.

42:08.160 --> 42:11.129
I KNOW THIS RECORD EXEC,
A FRIEND OF MY DAD'S.

42:11.130 --> 42:13.724
HE'S GOT LIKE THIS TOTAL
MAKE-OUT VAN FROM THE 705.

42:13.730 --> 42:16.221
HE THINKS IT'S SO COOL
AND IT'S JUST...

42:16.230 --> 42:17.549
NOT.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.449
HOW DO YOU THINK DENNIS
KNEW I HAD POT ?

42:22.460 --> 42:24.451
SO, YOUR DAD
DIED, HUH ?

42:24.460 --> 42:26.428
WHAT WAS
THAT LIKE ?

42:27.860 --> 42:29.293
I DON'T KNOW.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.888
IT DOESN'T SEEM REAL.

42:32.900 --> 42:35.949
I NEVER KNEW
ANYBODY THAT DIED.

42:35.960 --> 42:37.825
I GREW UP IN
A FUNERAL HOME, SO...

42:37.830 --> 42:40.355
I WAS ALWAYS
AROUND IT.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.751
OKAY, WAS THAT LIKE
COMPLETELY WEIRD ?

42:43.760 --> 42:45.955
YES.

42:49.430 --> 42:51.352
MY DAD'S A BIG SHOT
AT DISNEY.

42:51.360 --> 42:54.090
REALLY, WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO PRIVATE SCHOOL ?

42:54.100 --> 42:57.251
HE DIVORCED MY MOM
A LONG TIME AGO.

42:57.260 --> 42:59.820
HE LIKES HIS NEW
FAMILY BETTER.

42:59.830 --> 43:02.151
HE WON'T GIVE
MY MOM ALIMONY

43:02.160 --> 43:04.720
BECAUSE HE CAUGHT HER
HAVING SEX WITH LIKE,

43:04.730 --> 43:06.618
THIS RETARDED GUY.

43:06.630 --> 43:09.098
FUCK.

43:10.860 --> 43:12.350
I'M KIDDING.

43:12.360 --> 43:13.918
MY MOM GETS
KILLER ALIMONY.

43:13.930 --> 43:17.149
I JUST KEEP GETTING KICKED OUT
OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS.

43:18.930 --> 43:22.149
I THOUGHT YOU WERE LIKE
THIS TOTAL OVERACHIEVER.

43:22.160 --> 43:23.650
LIKE LITTLE
MISS PERFECT.

43:23.660 --> 43:24.888
GOOD...

43:24.900 --> 43:26.595
THAT'S WHAT I WANT
PEOPLE TO THINK.

43:26.600 --> 43:28.795
WHEN IN REALITY
YOU'RE LIKE THIS

43:28.800 --> 43:32.349
COM PU LSIVE LIAR,
DANGER SLUT.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.823
I THOUGHT YOU

43:36.830 --> 43:39.799
GOTH ARTY FREAK GIRL

43:39.800 --> 43:42.997
WHO WAS LIKE
TRAGIC AND SUICIDAL.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.719
OH, MY GOD, THAT IS
SO NOT WHO I AM.

43:47.360 --> 43:50.420
NOBODY IS EVER
WHO THEY SEEM TO BE.

43:53.600 --> 43:55.329
NOBODY INTERESTING.

43:56.360 --> 43:59.796
You told me that two lesbians
took a bath in my bathtub...

44:01.430 --> 44:03.591
I DON'T GET
THIS SHOW.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.194
IT'S A GAME SHOW.

44:06.200 --> 44:07.258
I KNOW THAT.

44:07.260 --> 44:08.818
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY PEOPLE LIKE IT.

44:08.830 --> 44:11.526
MY FRIEND AMELIA SAYS
IT'S HER FAVORITE SHOW.

44:11.530 --> 44:13.725
IT'S A GREAT SHOW.

44:13.730 --> 44:16.756
MY SON LIKES
"ONCE UPON A HAMSTER".

44:16.760 --> 44:20.093
WHEN I WAS HIS AGE, I WAS
CRAZY FOR "MAD MAGAZINE".

44:20.100 --> 44:23.422
ERNIE KOVACS,
THE MARX BROTHERS.

44:23.430 --> 44:26.797
ANYBODY THAT TOOK
POTSHOTS AT SACRED COWS.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.427
I MEAN ANYBODY.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.858
YEAH, I LOVED
ALL THAT STUFF.

44:55.860 --> 44:58.897
IRREVERENCE WAS
MY DRUG OF CHOICE.

45:00.830 --> 45:02.525
STILL IS, I GUESS.

45:02.530 --> 45:04.555
( laughing )

45:13.560 --> 45:15.551
NATE, MATE.

45:17.030 --> 45:20.329
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU

45:20.330 --> 45:23.049
I MEAN, PERSONALLY
I COULDN'T HANDLE HER

45:23.060 --> 45:25.290
PLAYING FREUD
ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

45:27.060 --> 45:29.756
I DON'T GIVE A FUCK
WHY I AM THE WAY I AM.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.499
WELL...

45:32.500 --> 45:35.060
SHE IS
A COM PLICATED WOMAN.

45:35.060 --> 45:37.620
NO, SHE'S NOT.

45:48.330 --> 45:50.798
( chattering and laughing )

45:54.560 --> 45:56.926
I FOUND THIS IN A SHOEBOX
AND MADE YOU A COPY.

45:56.930 --> 46:00.058
OH, THAT'S KILLER,
BILLY.

46:00.060 --> 46:03.496
OH, THAT'S
A GREAT SHOT, MATE.

46:03.500 --> 46:06.219
LOOK AT YOU
IN YOUR SLUGGOS.

46:10.760 --> 46:13.957
POOR YABBIE WOULDN'T KNOW
IF HIS ASS WAS ON FIRE.

46:13.960 --> 46:16.724
HE USELESS AS
THE BOTTOM HALF OF A MERMAID.

46:17.560 --> 46:20.996
PUT SOME SUNNIES ON,

46:21.000 --> 46:22.854
LET'S HAVE A BOBBLEY,

46:22.860 --> 46:25.522
CROCK A BINGLE,
YOU GOOGLIE.

46:25.530 --> 46:27.259
DRONGO.

46:47.460 --> 46:49.621
WHEN WAS
THAT TAKEN ?

46:49.630 --> 46:51.097
TWO SUMMERS AGO.

46:51.100 --> 46:52.556
IN PERTH.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.790
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU HADN'T
SEEN HIM IN, IN, IN...

46:54.800 --> 46:56.256
A DECADE.

46:56.260 --> 47:00.151
NO, I SAID CONNOR HASN'T
BEEN TO L.A. IN A DECADE.

47:00.160 --> 47:01.889
ALRIGHT, WHERE DO
YOU SLEEP, MATE ?

47:01.900 --> 47:05.256
'CAUSE THAT SLEEPING BAG
HASN'T MOVED AN INCH IN DAYS !

47:05.260 --> 47:06.898
THEY SLEEP IN
THE SAME BED,
WHERE ELSE ?

47:06.900 --> 47:09.789
DON'T CRACK A FIT,
NATE, MATE.

47:09.800 --> 47:12.894
I MEAN, SHE'S TOTALLY
WRAPPED UP IN YOU.

47:12.900 --> 47:15.858
OH, YOU JUST SHUT
THE FUCK UP, COWBOY !

47:15.860 --> 47:17.589
OKAY, OKAY,
I DIDN'T TELL YOU

47:17.600 --> 47:19.329
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D
REACT JUST LIKE THIS.

47:19.330 --> 47:21.548
WELL, HOW ELSE AM
I SUPPOSED TO REACT ?!

47:21.560 --> 47:23.994
OH SO, I'M SUPPOSED TO MAKE
AN OLD FRIEND SLEEP ON THE FLOOR

47:24.000 --> 47:25.820
JUST TO PROTECT
YOUR MACHO PRIDE ?

47:25.830 --> 47:27.422
YOU HAVE
A SHIATSU MAT.

47:27.430 --> 47:29.318
COME ON, MAN, HAVEN'T YOU
EVER SLEPT WITH A WOMAN

47:29.330 --> 47:30.729
AND NOT HAD
SEX WITH HER ?

47:34.330 --> 47:36.093
NO!

47:36.100 --> 47:38.295
OUTSIDE,
GET SOME AIR.

47:38.300 --> 47:41.428
GO OUTSIDE,
GET SOME AIR.

47:41.430 --> 47:43.022
FUCK YOU !

47:43.030 --> 47:44.952
I'M LEAVING !

47:48.800 --> 47:52.349

FUCK MATE, FUCKER !

47:53.930 --> 47:55.693
( moaning )

48:04.400 --> 48:06.994
DAMN, YOU ARE
VERSATILE.

48:12.160 --> 48:15.152
SO, YOU THINK I'M BEING
A POSSESSIVE ASSHOLE

48:15.160 --> 48:16.991
FOR WANTING
BRENDA FOR MYSELF ?

48:17.000 --> 48:18.456
WANTING TO FEEL CONNECTED
WITH SOMEONE

48:18.460 --> 48:20.451
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE POSSESSIVE,
OR AN ASSHOLE.

48:20.460 --> 48:22.325
BUT UNTIL THERE'S
A COMMITMENT,

48:22.330 --> 48:23.820
YOU HAVE NO
CLAIM ON HER.

48:23.830 --> 48:26.594
A WOMAN DOESN'T HAVE TO
WAIT TO BE CHOSEN ANYMORE.

48:26.600 --> 48:28.556
NOW SHE CAN
DO THE CHOOSING.

48:28.560 --> 48:29.788
YEAH, BUT IF SHE
WAITS TOO LONG,

48:29.800 --> 48:31.495
THE RIGHT GUY MIGHT
JUST MOVE ON.

48:31.500 --> 48:33.456
YOU'RE RIGHT, DEAR.

48:33.460 --> 48:35.428
YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

48:35.430 --> 48:38.797
A CHARTERED BUS OUT OF VEGAS
OVERTURNED ON THE 10 LAST NIGHT.

48:40.630 --> 48:42.951
44 PASSENGERS.

48:42.960 --> 48:45.099
MOST OF THEM DEAD.

48:45.100 --> 48:47.921
DID YOU SLEEP
WELL LAST NIGHT ?

48:47.930 --> 48:49.329
YES, THANK YOU.

48:49.330 --> 48:51.389
YOU SLEEP AT
ALL LAST NIGHT ?

48:52.430 --> 48:54.398
HOW'D THE FUNERAL
DIRECTOR'S TEST GO ?

48:54.400 --> 48:56.049
OH, MAN, I CHOKED.

48:56.060 --> 48:57.459
WHAT A CLUSTER FUCK.

48:57.460 --> 48:58.620
LANGUAGE.

48:58.630 --> 49:00.120
YOU JUST
SAID ASSHOLE.

49:00.130 --> 49:01.495
NATE, I NEED YOU
TO PASS THAT TEST.

49:01.500 --> 49:02.990
YEAH, WELL, DAVE,

49:03.000 --> 49:05.059
I NEED YOU TO LIGHTEN UP
ON ME, STARTING NOW.

49:10.930 --> 49:12.397
HEY.

49:13.060 --> 49:15.620
FIRST OF ALL, I JUST
WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS

49:15.630 --> 49:17.495
FOR EVERYTHING THAT
YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

49:17.500 --> 49:19.195
BUT I THINK IT'S TIME
FOR ME TO MOVE ON.

49:19.200 --> 49:22.556
I HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT MY FUTURE.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.425
MY FAMILY'S FUTURE.

49:24.430 --> 49:25.499
YOU'RE LEAVING US ?

49:25.500 --> 49:26.797
OH, DEAR.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.995
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GIVEN US
A CHANCE TO COUNTER KROEHNER'S--

49:29.000 --> 49:31.093
AM I A PARTNER ?

49:36.800 --> 49:40.099
YOU GUYS DIDN'T
EVEN TALK ABOUT IT.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.792
THANK YOU,
FEDERICO.

49:46.800 --> 49:50.588
I'M SORRY THAT
WE CAN'T OFFER YOU MORE.

49:53.560 --> 49:56.529
YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A JOB
WAITING FOR YOU HERE.

50:01.100 --> 50:03.295
KROEHNER WILL NEVER APPRECIATE
HOW GOOD YOU ARE, RICO.

50:03.300 --> 50:05.894
YOU'LL JUST BE A PART
OF THEIR ASSEMBLY LINE.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.118
WE'LL SEE.

50:13.630 --> 50:15.518
OH, WORD OF ADVICE,
GUYS...

50:15.530 --> 50:18.499
DON'T TURN YOUR
BACK ON GILARDI.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.898
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR LOYALTY.

50:21.900 --> 50:24.824
NATE, HE'S GIVEN US
FIVE YEARS.

50:24.830 --> 50:26.252
HE DOESN'T
OWE US ANYTHING.

50:26.260 --> 50:28.626
NOBODY OWES US.

50:34.330 --> 50:35.888
( knocking )

50:48.860 --> 50:51.454
MY ONLY DEFENSE IS
I THINK I WAS HALLUCINATING.

50:54.660 --> 50:57.788
THAT AND THE THOUGHT OF YOU
WITH ANOTHER MAN MAKES ME CRAZY.

50:57.800 --> 50:59.756
SORRY.

51:01.560 --> 51:04.120
I'M JUST A GUY
THAT WAY.

51:05.500 --> 51:07.252
SO, WHERE'S CONNOR ?

51:07.260 --> 51:08.750
OH, GOD,
I THREW HIM OUT.

51:08.760 --> 51:11.524
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
OF HIM I CAN TAKE.

51:13.500 --> 51:15.525
SO, YOU FORGIVE ME ?

51:15.530 --> 51:18.351
SURE, WHY NOT ?

51:18.360 --> 51:19.258
GOOD.

51:19.260 --> 51:21.797
NOW IT'S
YOUR TURN.

51:23.660 --> 51:25.389
YOU WANT ME
TO APOLOGIZE ?

51:25.400 --> 51:26.424
YES.

51:29.800 --> 51:32.598
FOR TRYING TO USE BILLY'S
MELTDOWN AND CONNOR'S VISIT

51:32.600 --> 51:34.556
TO PUSH ME AWAY.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.051
FOR BEING IMPATIENT
WITH MY VERY VALID

51:37.060 --> 51:39.199
EMOTIONAL RESPONSE
TO EACH ONE.

51:39.200 --> 51:42.351
AND FOR ALWAYS ASKING ME TO
ADJUST MY BEHAVIOR AND FEELINGS

51:42.360 --> 51:45.420
BUT NEVER BEING WILLING
TO DO THAT YOURSELF.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.619
OKAY, THAT'S FAIR.

51:51.330 --> 51:53.423
I APOLOGIZE.

51:55.160 --> 51:56.650
PART OF YOU
WANTS ME TO BAIL.

51:56.660 --> 52:00.596
YEAH, YOU'RE
PROBABLY RIGHT.

52:01.430 --> 52:02.829
WHY ?

52:07.500 --> 52:10.594
BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY
GONE FURTHER THAN I HAVE

52:10.600 --> 52:12.818
WITH ANYBODY SINCE...

52:14.000 --> 52:16.218
SINCE A LONG
TIME AGO.

52:18.260 --> 52:21.957
BECAUSE EVERY TIME I'VE EVER
BELIEVED IN A HAPPY ENDING,

52:21.960 --> 52:25.350
I'VE GOTTEN
SEVERELY FUCKED.

52:27.360 --> 52:29.157
SORRY.

52:31.400 --> 52:33.459
WELL, DO ME
A FAVOR.

52:33.460 --> 52:36.099
PROMISE ME THAT
FROM HERE ON OUT

52:36.100 --> 52:38.898
I AM THE ONLY NAKED MAN
IN YOUR BED AND IN YOUR LIFE.

52:38.900 --> 52:41.221
I'M SERIOUS, BREN.

52:41.230 --> 52:43.323
PROMISE ME.

52:44.930 --> 52:47.490
I PROMISE.

52:47.900 --> 52:50.926
I LOVE YOU AND I WANT TO
BE WITH YOU FOR THE LONG HAUL.

52:50.930 --> 52:53.626
BUT THERE'S A LIMIT
TO THE AMOUNT OF SHIT
I WILL PUT UP WITH.

52:53.630 --> 52:56.758
DID YOU JUST MAKE ME
A LIFETIME COMMITMENT,

52:56.760 --> 52:59.422
RIGHT BEFORE THE THINLY-VEILED
THREAT OF ABANDONMENT ?

52:59.430 --> 53:03.696
WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER
USING THE WORD LIFETIME.

53:03.700 --> 53:06.555
OH, WELL, I WON'T
HOLD YOU TO IT.

53:14.700 --> 53:15.849
OH.

53:16.830 --> 53:21.096
SORRY I'M SO WEIRD
ABOUT INTIMACY.

53:23.060 --> 53:25.949
I GUESS SPENDING YOUR
CHILDHOOD BEING PICKED APART

53:25.960 --> 53:29.020
BY BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGISTS
WILL DO THAT.

53:29.930 --> 53:33.320
YEAH, WELL, NOT BEING
ABLE TO SLEEP AT NIGHT

53:33.330 --> 53:35.218
BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR BASEMENT'S
FULL OF DEAD PEOPLE

53:35.230 --> 53:37.448
TAKES ITS TOLL TOO.

53:48.630 --> 53:51.394
( phone )

53:53.500 --> 53:55.559
SORRY.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.195
NATE FISHER.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.623
REMEMBER THAT CHARTERED BUS
THAT OVERTURNED LAST NIGHT ?

54:04.630 --> 54:06.222
THEY WERE
ALL LOCALS.

54:06.230 --> 54:07.697
WE'RE GETTING
THREE OF THEM.

54:07.700 --> 54:09.156
THE FIRST FAMILY
WILL BE HERE IN AN HOUR.

54:09.160 --> 54:11.196
I'M ON MY WAY.

54:11.200 --> 54:12.895
AND TRY TO CURB
YOUR ENTHUSIASM.

54:12.900 --> 54:14.697
THIS'LL BE TOUGH
WITHOUT RICO.

54:14.700 --> 54:16.349
See you later.

54:35.560 --> 54:38.222
GOOD LORD, WHAT DID
THEY DO TO YOU ?

54:38.230 --> 54:39.754
DON'T ASK.

54:45.530 --> 54:48.624
SO, DID MOM FREAK WHEN
YOU TOLD HER I GOT BUSTED ?

54:48.630 --> 54:51.224
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

54:52.930 --> 54:54.659
OKAY, WHY ?

54:54.660 --> 54:56.855
I DON'T KNOW,
OTHER STUFF CAME UP.

54:56.860 --> 54:59.590
IT SEEMED LIKE
A LOW PRIORITY.

54:59.600 --> 55:01.022
ARE YOU GOING TO ?

55:01.030 --> 55:02.588
PROBABLY NOT.

55:06.200 --> 55:07.929
I'M SORRY THE CROSSROADS
THING DIDN'T WORK OUT

55:07.930 --> 55:09.329
LIKE YOU HAD HOPED.

55:09.330 --> 55:11.890
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
KIND OF AMAZING.

55:11.900 --> 55:15.529
I THINK I REALLY LEARNED
SOMETHING VALUABLE.

55:17.260 --> 55:19.797
EVERYTHING I THINK
I KNOW IS WRONG.

55:28.200 --> 55:30.350
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT GUY KEITH ?

55:35.060 --> 55:36.857
IT JUST DIDN'T
WORK OUT.

55:41.730 --> 55:43.357
THAT'S TOO BAD.

55:43.360 --> 55:45.123
LIFE GOES ON.

55:48.930 --> 55:50.750
THAT IT DOES.

55:51.630 --> 55:53.029
WELL...

55:53.030 --> 55:55.157
THERE'S WORK
TO BE DONE.
