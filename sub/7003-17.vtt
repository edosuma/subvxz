WEBVTT

00:02.401 --> 00:04.235
It's also
about male improvement.

00:04.236 --> 00:06.237
So, continuing
our male improvement series,

00:06.238 --> 00:08.907
Al and I are gonna talk
about men and their shoes.

00:08.908 --> 00:12.877
That's right.
We'll be delving into
shoe repair and shoe shining.

00:12.878 --> 00:15.279
Not to mention shoe trees.

00:18.217 --> 00:19.217
And shoehorns.

00:19.218 --> 00:22.487
<i>(♪ horn)</i>

00:23.823 --> 00:26.257
Anyway, here's a pair
of wing tips over here

00:26.258 --> 00:28.259
That have certainly seen
better days.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.795
Now, when you have
a shoe this damaged,

00:30.796 --> 00:33.832
You wanna take it down
to the original leather
using rubbing alcohol.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.334
Then for the rough spots,
use a little leather dye.

00:36.335 --> 00:38.870
Polish her up,
you got a shoe
as good as new.

00:38.871 --> 00:41.873
Remember,
when you're using shoe polish,
use a little bit of water.

00:41.874 --> 00:43.875
It'll make that shine
really spectacular.
That's right.

00:43.876 --> 00:46.845
Then you wanna buff it
with a cloth diaper.

00:46.846 --> 00:49.447
Make sure you remove
the baby first, though.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.785
This will give your shoe
a sheen for sure.

00:53.786 --> 00:55.553
You don't shay.

00:58.724 --> 01:00.525
All right, now, tim,

01:00.526 --> 01:03.594
What were to happen if we have
a brand-new pair of shoes

01:03.595 --> 01:06.164
And the leather is hard
and uncomfortable?

01:06.165 --> 01:08.166
Ooh, that could be
a big problem

01:08.167 --> 01:10.168
If you had feet
like al's mom.

01:17.543 --> 01:19.577
Well, for shoes like this,

01:19.578 --> 01:24.049
My mother always used
binford's leather softener.

01:24.050 --> 01:28.086
But that
turns your new hard shoes

01:28.087 --> 01:30.655
Into the old soft shoe.
Klaus?

01:30.656 --> 01:34.625
<i>(♪ "the old soft shoe")</i>

01:34.626 --> 01:35.626
<i>(hand smacks)</i>

01:39.065 --> 01:40.198
<i>(gong sounds)</i>

01:45.771 --> 01:47.906
<i>(boing)</i>

01:47.907 --> 01:49.841
<i>(nut cracks)</i>

01:49.842 --> 01:52.610
<i>(whistle slide)</i>

01:52.611 --> 01:53.845
Ah.

01:56.582 --> 01:59.117
Thanks, but enough
of that foolishness.

01:59.118 --> 02:02.120
Let's get on
with the next part
of the shoe repair.

02:02.121 --> 02:04.122
Tim, do you call that
a soft shoe?

02:04.123 --> 02:06.124
It was a joke, al.
Anyway...
Klaus?

02:06.125 --> 02:09.493
<i>(♪ piano)</i>

02:09.494 --> 02:12.363
Oh, don?

02:12.364 --> 02:14.532
<i>(♪ "the old soft shoe")</i>

03:47.893 --> 03:50.528
What do you think? Should we
put the kids in the middle?

03:53.499 --> 03:55.433
All right, randy,
I'm ready to teach you

03:55.434 --> 03:57.468
The most important skill
in hockey.

03:57.469 --> 04:00.905
Fighting.
No, goaltending.

04:00.906 --> 04:02.907
Are you sure
this is gonna help?

04:02.908 --> 04:05.210
Positive.
It can't hurt.

04:05.211 --> 04:07.378
Last week
you gave up 14 goals.

04:07.379 --> 04:08.512
15.

04:08.513 --> 04:12.516
No, 15 is what you got
on your math test.

04:12.517 --> 04:14.518
Give it a rest, guys, ok?

04:14.519 --> 04:18.122
Now, this is the tim taylor
authorized puck chucker.

04:19.858 --> 04:22.593
Move out of the way, please.
Put your mask down.

04:22.594 --> 04:25.029
Remember what I taught you.

04:25.030 --> 04:28.199
This thing shoots
at incredible speed.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.207
Whoa.

04:36.208 --> 04:39.878
That thing is incredible.

04:39.879 --> 04:42.013
Good thing
he's wearing padding.

04:42.014 --> 04:45.016
<i>(fake laugh)</i> I gotta get
the instruction book out.

04:45.017 --> 04:46.951
Once I get the instructions,

04:46.952 --> 04:50.421
We'll see how many pucks
this hockey-puck chucker
can chuck.

04:50.422 --> 04:54.292
If the puck chucker
could chuck pucks.

04:55.527 --> 04:57.362
Shouldn't your dad
be here?

04:57.363 --> 04:59.030
You know the colonel.

04:59.031 --> 05:01.366
If he says he'll be here
at 1700 hours,

05:01.367 --> 05:03.368
He means 1700 hours sharp.

05:03.369 --> 05:06.437
1700 hours.
What time is that again?

05:06.438 --> 05:10.508
5:00. I've been trying
to teach you military time
for 15 years.

05:10.509 --> 05:12.210
Now, listen to this.

05:12.211 --> 05:15.479
You subtract 12 if it's
a double-digit number
greater than 12.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.283
If it's
a single-digit number,
it's the actual time.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.985
If it's a double-digit number
that's less than or equal
to 12,

05:20.986 --> 05:22.653
That's also
the actual time.

05:22.654 --> 05:26.724
Have you got that?
Yeah.

05:26.725 --> 05:28.026
Hmm.

05:28.027 --> 05:31.495
I wish your mom was coming.
At least she speaks civilian.

05:31.496 --> 05:34.198
Me too. She said she needed
a break from dad.

05:34.199 --> 05:36.200
She wants to have one week

05:36.201 --> 05:40.338
Where she doesn't have to
get up before dawn
and raise the flag.

05:40.339 --> 05:43.574
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
oh, he's here,
he's here!

05:43.575 --> 05:46.777
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
all right!

05:46.778 --> 05:48.179
Hey, dad.
Daddy!

05:48.180 --> 05:50.415
Hello, sweetheart!

05:50.416 --> 05:52.783
How's my little girl?

05:52.784 --> 05:55.753
Great.
I'm so happy to see you.

05:59.325 --> 06:02.360
Do you still live here?

06:02.361 --> 06:05.363
Colonel, good to see you.
I see the lincoln's
running well.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.199
Oh, got me up here
all the way from texas.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.701
I tell you,
'61 was a vintage year.

06:10.702 --> 06:13.604
You should've bought one
the day they came out.

06:13.605 --> 06:17.475
I would've, sir,
but I was six.

06:17.476 --> 06:19.910
That's no excuse.

06:19.911 --> 06:23.581
Hey, we're getting <i>tool time</i>
on the satellite.

06:23.582 --> 06:24.782
That's what nana told us.

06:24.783 --> 06:27.251
I don't watch it,
but we get it.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.122
Just kidding.
You know I love <i>tool time.</i>

06:31.123 --> 06:34.225
Would you like a drink?
Water,
straight from the tap.

06:34.226 --> 06:37.161
None of that
hippy bottled stuff.

06:37.162 --> 06:41.099
Say, did you get the tickets
to the guns and knives show?

06:41.100 --> 06:42.600
Guns and knives?

06:42.601 --> 06:46.004
I thought you wanted
to see guns 'n roses.

06:46.005 --> 06:48.039
What?

06:48.040 --> 06:51.275
It's a joke. It's a joke.

06:51.276 --> 06:55.346
Ah, you're a great kidder.
Let me put you
up in mark's room.

06:55.347 --> 06:57.548
There are the kids.
<i>(mark)</i> grandpa!

06:57.549 --> 07:00.618
There's my troops!
Attention!

07:02.888 --> 07:04.788
At ease.

07:04.789 --> 07:08.692
Ah, hair's getting
a little long.

07:08.693 --> 07:11.162
Maybe later we'll all go
for crew cuts.

07:11.163 --> 07:13.464
Yeah, right.

07:15.434 --> 07:18.702
What did you say?
Um, nothing, sir.

07:18.703 --> 07:19.970
<i>(laughs)</i>

07:19.971 --> 07:22.140
Grandpa,
what did you bring us?

07:22.141 --> 07:24.342
Hey, hey, come on, mark.
Where are your manners?

07:24.343 --> 07:26.344
Hey, what's
a grandfather for?

07:26.345 --> 07:29.247
I got you guys
a special treat.

07:29.248 --> 07:30.681
Shrapnel.

07:33.685 --> 07:36.987
Cool. Let's go
show jeremy.

07:36.988 --> 07:39.657
Hey, watch it with that stuff.
It's sharp.
You bet it's sharp.

07:39.658 --> 07:43.394
That shrapnel was removed
from my... Forget where
it was removed from.

07:45.531 --> 07:49.133
You gave the boys shrapnel?
What did you give me?

07:49.134 --> 07:51.969
I gave you my daughter.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.205
Yeah, you're right, sir,

07:54.206 --> 07:57.175
But I'm kinda tired
of playing with that gift.

08:04.950 --> 08:08.519
You know, tim, about you
always calling me "sir..."

08:08.520 --> 08:10.221
Yeah?

08:10.222 --> 08:12.390
I like it.

08:12.391 --> 08:14.992
No, actually I do have something
for the both of you.

08:14.993 --> 08:16.561
His-and-her bazookas.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.563
Better.

08:18.564 --> 08:22.567
I wrote a book
about my experiences
in the military.

08:22.568 --> 08:25.736
I got a copy
for each of you.
Hefty.

08:25.737 --> 08:28.406
Dad, you wrote a book.
This is great.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.742
If schwarzkopf can do it,
any bum can.

08:31.743 --> 08:35.746
You know, I thought, you know,
since you work at the magazine,

08:35.746 --> 08:38.416
You could read it
and if you like it,

08:38.417 --> 08:41.952
You might pass it along
to some of your friends
in publishing.

08:41.953 --> 08:44.989
Oh, dad, I'm so excited.
I can't wait to read it.

08:44.990 --> 08:48.259
And I can't wait to have you
tell me what you thought of it.

08:48.260 --> 08:49.793
Now, what time's dinner?

08:49.794 --> 08:52.196
2300 hours, sir.

08:54.799 --> 08:57.135
That's 11pm.

08:57.136 --> 08:58.969
We eat late.

09:14.019 --> 09:17.388
Are you enjoying it?
A lot of facts.

09:17.389 --> 09:20.625
Yeah, it's so detailed.
Tremendous detail.

09:20.626 --> 09:23.394
And it's not flowery.
Oh, no flowers here.

09:23.395 --> 09:27.365
No, just page after page
of detail.

09:27.366 --> 09:30.901
Can't go wrong with details.

09:30.902 --> 09:34.438
It's boring, isn't it?

09:34.439 --> 09:36.407
It's mind-numbing.

09:38.777 --> 09:41.078
I thought this was gonna be
more of a story,

09:41.079 --> 09:42.746
But there's nothing in there

09:42.747 --> 09:44.915
But tactics
and military strategy.

09:44.916 --> 09:47.117
What are we
going to tell him?

09:47.118 --> 09:50.821
Tell him the truth.
Oh, sure.
You know my dad.

09:50.822 --> 09:53.824
He hears bad news,
he hits the roof,
then he sulks,

09:53.825 --> 09:55.826
Then he doesn't wanna
talk about it anymore,

09:55.827 --> 09:58.529
And then the whole thing
remains unresolved.

09:58.530 --> 10:02.966
He can take it.
He's a tough guy.
He gives shrapnel as gifts.

10:02.967 --> 10:05.969
No way.
I cannot ever tell him.

10:05.970 --> 10:08.606
Why not?
When I do something
you don't like,

10:08.607 --> 10:11.141
You don't hold back on me.
<i>(laughing)</i>

10:14.179 --> 10:17.281
I've held back
lots of things from you, tim.

10:17.282 --> 10:19.783
Back the truth trolley up here
a little bit.

10:19.784 --> 10:22.186
What kind of things
don't you let me know?

10:22.187 --> 10:25.155
Oh, where shall I start?

10:25.156 --> 10:27.391
With one.

10:27.392 --> 10:30.761
Ok. You know
that green suit you bought?

10:30.762 --> 10:35.032
That wasn't green.
That was more of a pistachio.

10:35.033 --> 10:37.668
You said it was stunning.

10:37.669 --> 10:40.671
What was stunning
was that you could
walk into a store

10:40.672 --> 10:43.474
And actually walk out
with that suit.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.476
We got the machine
up and running.

10:45.477 --> 10:47.478
You're gonna operate it
from back here.

10:47.479 --> 10:49.480
Remember
what I told you.
All right.

10:49.481 --> 10:51.482
I'll give you
the pointers now.

10:51.483 --> 10:54.218
The most important thing
about being a goalie...

10:54.219 --> 10:56.454
Is that these things hurt!

10:56.455 --> 10:59.089
Sorry, dad.

11:00.459 --> 11:04.729
A good goalie
is always prepared,
all right?

11:08.967 --> 11:11.669
Hey. Hey! Hey!

11:11.670 --> 11:15.740
I saw where
you're aiming that thing.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.408
All right, stand in.

11:17.409 --> 11:20.043
Dad, I can't.
We ran out of pucks.
I need to reload.

11:20.044 --> 11:22.112
All right, reload.

11:22.113 --> 11:25.383
Dad, when is grandpa
getting up?

11:25.384 --> 11:31.389
Uh, let's see.
He went to bed
at 2300 hours.

11:31.390 --> 11:33.957
He wanted nine hours
of sleep.

11:33.958 --> 11:36.126
That's 3200...

11:36.127 --> 11:37.995
Minus 12.

11:37.996 --> 11:39.897
You add that up.

11:39.898 --> 11:41.299
Uh...

11:41.300 --> 11:43.401
20 o'clock.

11:47.339 --> 11:50.508
Remember, when dad comes down
and asks how we liked the book,

11:50.509 --> 11:52.677
We tell him
that we loved it.

11:52.678 --> 11:56.013
If you wanna lie to your dad,
that's your business.
I don't wanna lie.

11:56.014 --> 11:58.949
That's just how we do things
in my family.

12:00.385 --> 12:03.621
Would it make you feel better
if I told him the truth?

12:03.622 --> 12:05.790
Oh, honey,
that is so sweet.

12:05.791 --> 12:08.492
I should be the one
to tell him, though.

12:08.493 --> 12:10.661
Great.

12:10.662 --> 12:12.330
But since I can't...

12:12.331 --> 12:13.464
Jill...
Well...

12:13.465 --> 12:14.998
Jill, listen to me.

12:14.999 --> 12:17.335
Look, what if
I get the ball rolling

12:17.336 --> 12:20.003
And you just jump in
when you feel comfortable?

12:20.004 --> 12:22.005
That might work.
Sure it will.

12:22.006 --> 12:25.309
I'll tell him how I feel
about it, and then you
just back me up.

12:25.310 --> 12:28.245
But you have to promise
to be tactful.

12:28.246 --> 12:31.649
Have I ever been
anything but tactful?

12:31.650 --> 12:33.317
Good morning.
<i>(tim)</i> morning.

12:33.318 --> 12:34.985
Daddy,
how'd you sleep?

12:34.986 --> 12:38.756
Oh, great.
But I'm starting to grow
out of mark's bed.

12:38.757 --> 12:41.659
Coffee?
Oh, I'd love some.

12:41.660 --> 12:46.063
So, did you read
my book?
I'll get the coffee.

12:46.064 --> 12:48.399
Yes. Yes, we did
read the book.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.401
So what did you think
of it, honey?

12:50.402 --> 12:53.003
Would you like eggs
or waffles?

12:53.004 --> 12:54.805
Eggs.

12:54.806 --> 12:57.307
There's a lot
of good stuff in there.

12:57.308 --> 13:00.378
Oh, yeah, a lot.

13:02.347 --> 13:04.749
It's a tad bit wordy.

13:05.917 --> 13:07.852
You know, in a good way.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.989
A writer's
supposed to use words.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.891
What do you want - pictures?

13:13.892 --> 13:16.594
Could've helped it a little.

13:18.363 --> 13:20.364
What was so odd -
you have a book,

13:20.365 --> 13:22.533
And there's no people
in it.

13:22.534 --> 13:26.003
This is a book
about policy and objectives
and how to win a war.

13:26.004 --> 13:28.739
You don't wanna clutter that up
with a lot of people.

13:33.144 --> 13:34.812
Good point.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.814
Writing a book about war,

13:36.815 --> 13:38.816
You don't wanna talk
about people.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.151
What are you trying
to tell me, tim -

13:41.152 --> 13:43.821
That you had mixed feelings
about my book?

13:43.822 --> 13:46.123
I wouldn't say that.

13:48.293 --> 13:50.294
You wouldn't know
good literature

13:50.295 --> 13:52.362
If it bit you
in the butt.

13:54.132 --> 13:57.134
Well, honey, I...
I think I've gotten
that ball rolling

13:57.135 --> 13:59.236
About as far
as it's gonna go.

14:00.605 --> 14:02.606
Why don't you jump in

14:02.607 --> 14:05.108
And tell your dad
what you thought
of the book?

14:05.109 --> 14:06.710
Honey?
Jill?

14:06.711 --> 14:09.480
Loved it. It's the best book
I ever read.

14:22.494 --> 14:24.495
So, can I get you
something else?

14:24.496 --> 14:26.831
Would you like
a slice of coffeecake?

14:26.832 --> 14:30.167
Sure. Just use the knife
you stuck in my back.

14:31.603 --> 14:33.604
Can't believe
you sold me out.

14:33.605 --> 14:35.105
Tim, you're overreacting.

14:35.106 --> 14:37.608
What I know
is that I tell the truth

14:37.609 --> 14:39.610
And I come out
like the bad guy.

14:39.611 --> 14:42.245
How can you be so selfish?

14:44.649 --> 14:45.850
What?

14:45.851 --> 14:48.385
This whole thing
is between me and my father,

14:48.386 --> 14:51.489
And all you care about
is how you come off?
What?

14:51.490 --> 14:55.258
I think you could be
a little more supportive
in a situation like this.

14:55.259 --> 14:57.561
Supportive about...
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:57.562 --> 14:59.730
I-I appreciate
you defending me,

14:59.731 --> 15:02.165
But he's entitled
to his opinion.

15:02.166 --> 15:05.002
Thank you.
Even though
we both know he's wrong.

15:05.003 --> 15:08.338
Let's face it, tim,
you have no taste.

15:08.339 --> 15:10.440
Tim has wonderful taste.

15:10.441 --> 15:13.343
Oh, yeah? Remember
that green suit he wore

15:13.344 --> 15:15.479
To your sister's wedding?

15:15.480 --> 15:20.751
It wasn't green,
it was avocado, almost melon.

15:20.752 --> 15:24.254
So, uh, when are you
going to bring my book

15:24.255 --> 15:26.056
To your publisher?

15:26.057 --> 15:27.725
Well, you know, dad,

15:27.726 --> 15:30.360
I think that, um,
she's kinda busy right now.

15:30.361 --> 15:32.362
She's out of town, in fact.

15:32.363 --> 15:36.033
Well, who's
the number two in command?
We'll speak to him instead.

15:36.034 --> 15:38.435
Oh, dad, he's not gonna want
to talk to me.

15:38.436 --> 15:40.437
He doesn't even know
I work there.

15:40.438 --> 15:43.841
Then this could be
your opportunity
to put yourself on the map.

15:43.842 --> 15:48.579
Dad, I couldn't... Use you
to further my career.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.448
Nonsense.

15:51.449 --> 15:54.919
Now, we'll go down there
first thing tomorrow morning

15:54.920 --> 15:57.788
And show them my book.

15:57.789 --> 16:00.424
I can't do that.
Why not?

16:02.961 --> 16:08.933
Because I wasn't totally honest
with you before.

16:11.436 --> 16:15.072
Daddy, this is really hard
for me to say, but...

16:15.073 --> 16:18.542
The book is...
Is just really not very good.

16:18.543 --> 16:21.979
Then why'd you say
you loved it?
That's what you wanted to hear.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.314
Don't tell me
what I wanted to hear.
I want to hear the truth!

16:24.315 --> 16:26.416
Well, I'm telling it
to you now.

16:26.417 --> 16:29.419
Fine!
You didn't like the book.

16:29.420 --> 16:34.357
I'm gonna get the boys.
We'll be back at 1300 hours.

16:34.358 --> 16:36.126
What time is that?

16:36.127 --> 16:39.229
It's 1:00!

16:39.230 --> 16:42.299
Why is that so difficult
for you to understand?

16:42.300 --> 16:45.402
Every private in the army
gets it by the end
of the first day!

16:47.205 --> 16:49.707
Daddy, I'm really sorry
that I upset you, but...

16:49.708 --> 16:52.977
I'm not upset!
If I were upset
I'd be yelling!

16:56.414 --> 17:00.283
I remember now.
The salesman said that suit
was a loden heather.

17:19.503 --> 17:23.073
<i>(snoring)</i>

17:25.143 --> 17:26.242
Wilson?
Huh?

17:29.313 --> 17:30.447
<i>(clears throat)</i>

17:30.448 --> 17:33.817
Hi-de-ho, neighborette.

17:33.818 --> 17:35.719
What are you doing?

17:35.720 --> 17:38.722
Well, I'm just trying to read
this extremely lengthy tome

17:38.723 --> 17:40.724
That your father gave me.

17:40.725 --> 17:42.893
Why are you doing it out here?
It's freezing cold.

17:42.894 --> 17:47.397
Well, I tried reading inside,
but I kept falling asleep.

17:47.398 --> 17:51.769
Tim and I tried
to talk to him about it today,
but he just got real upset.

17:51.770 --> 17:54.638
There are those people
that don't respond well
to criticism.

17:54.639 --> 17:57.007
Yeah, and some of 'em yell.
Mm.

17:57.008 --> 17:59.609
You remember
that movie <i>old yeller?</i>
Mm-hmm.

17:59.610 --> 18:02.579
When it came out,
we thought it was about daddy.

18:04.182 --> 18:06.684
That must have been difficult
to grow up with.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.185
Yeah, it was.

18:08.186 --> 18:10.320
That's why we had
this house policy

18:10.321 --> 18:12.122
Never to upset him.

18:12.123 --> 18:15.659
I always tried
to follow that rule,
but today I couldn't.

18:15.660 --> 18:18.095
So, you're feeling
that telling him the truth

18:18.096 --> 18:19.596
Was a mistake?

18:19.597 --> 18:23.133
I've always
really adored my father.

18:23.134 --> 18:25.468
You know,
I don't wanna do anything

18:25.469 --> 18:27.470
To hurt that relationship.

18:27.471 --> 18:31.008
You mean the relationship
where you don't tell him
the truth?

18:32.410 --> 18:34.745
Yeah, that would be the one.

18:34.746 --> 18:36.279
I don't know.

18:36.280 --> 18:38.949
I mean, look what happened
when I told him the truth.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.451
Maybe I should have
just kept my mouth shut.

18:41.452 --> 18:44.955
Well, george bernard shaw
wouldn't have thought so.

18:44.956 --> 18:47.457
He said we must not stay
as we are,

18:47.458 --> 18:50.227
Doing always
what was done last time,

18:50.228 --> 18:53.731
Or we shall stick in the mud.

18:53.732 --> 18:57.567
Well, I'm stuck
in something deep here,
wilson, but it ain't mud.

19:00.205 --> 19:03.540
So, I'm standing there
in korea

19:03.541 --> 19:06.343
Right on the 38th parallel,

19:06.344 --> 19:08.979
When who taps me
on the shoulder?

19:08.980 --> 19:11.949
General douglas macarthur.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.718
Who?

19:14.719 --> 19:18.021
Your father never told you
about general macarthur?

19:18.022 --> 19:20.824
No, but he told me
about general motors.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.327
Well, this guy was even bigger.

19:24.328 --> 19:26.930
So we're standing there,

19:26.931 --> 19:29.532
And what do you think
he hands me?

19:29.533 --> 19:32.136
An apple?
A grenade.

19:32.137 --> 19:35.072
You know how to throw
one of these things, son?

19:35.073 --> 19:37.074
You grip it
in your right hand,

19:37.075 --> 19:39.943
You pull the pin
with your teeth

19:39.944 --> 19:42.012
And you let it fly.

19:42.013 --> 19:45.115
No throwing grenades
in the house, mark.

19:45.116 --> 19:47.450
How'd you know what it was?

19:47.451 --> 19:51.354
You kidding? I grew up
with fruit ammunition.

19:51.355 --> 19:53.556
Honey, um,
would you go upstairs?

19:53.557 --> 19:55.659
I wanna talk to grandpa.
Ok.

19:58.897 --> 20:01.198
Can I talk to you
for a minute, dad?

20:01.199 --> 20:03.633
About what?
And don't say the book.

20:03.634 --> 20:06.837
I wish you wouldn't take
my criticism personally.

20:06.838 --> 20:09.339
I said I don't wanna talk
about the book.
Well, I do.

20:12.543 --> 20:14.544
Where do you get off
criticizing me

20:14.545 --> 20:16.113
In the first place?

20:16.114 --> 20:18.115
What do you know
about the military?

20:18.116 --> 20:20.617
You see, this is why
I didn't wanna tell you.

20:20.618 --> 20:22.686
I knew you would overreact.
You always do.

20:22.687 --> 20:25.189
That's why nobody can ever
tell you anything.
What are you talking about?

20:25.190 --> 20:28.358
When we were growing up,
we weren't allowed to tell you
anything that might upset you.

20:28.359 --> 20:32.595
Oh, really?
Then why the hell
was I upset so much?

20:32.596 --> 20:37.334
Dad, you didn't know half
of what was going on
in that house.

20:37.335 --> 20:39.336
I knew everything.
Oh, you did, did you?

20:39.337 --> 20:42.005
Ok, did you know
that when I was in high school

20:42.006 --> 20:44.674
When I said I was going
on that all-girl ski weekend,

20:44.675 --> 20:47.577
I really went to
a peace March in washington
with tommy burnett?

20:47.578 --> 20:50.214
Tommy the commie?

20:50.215 --> 20:52.049
I don't wanna know it.

20:52.050 --> 20:54.384
You see? You wanna be kept
in the dark.

20:54.385 --> 20:56.386
Some things
are better left unsaid.

20:56.387 --> 20:59.389
Maybe for you,
'cause then you could have
the same order at home

20:59.390 --> 21:02.226
That you had at the base,
but we're not your soldiers.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.228
Damn right. My soldiers
were under control.

21:04.229 --> 21:07.231
Then I'd come home
to your mother
and you five girls,

21:07.232 --> 21:10.567
And I never knew
what the hell was going on!

21:17.508 --> 21:20.010
Dad...

21:20.011 --> 21:22.812
I love you so much,

21:22.813 --> 21:27.584
And there were a million times
that I needed to talk to you,

21:27.585 --> 21:30.820
But I felt like I couldn't.

21:30.821 --> 21:34.591
I always thought
I was pretty easy to talk to.

21:34.592 --> 21:36.927
Well, you're not.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.897
Well, we're talking now.

21:39.898 --> 21:41.899
Yeah.

21:48.106 --> 21:52.142
Look, honey, I'm sorry
I chewed your head off

21:52.143 --> 21:54.844
About the book.

21:54.845 --> 21:57.948
I'm sorry
I didn't like the book,

21:57.949 --> 22:01.651
But I'm glad
that I had the guts
to tell you the truth.

22:10.628 --> 22:14.131
If you look at it in this light,
it's more of a lima bean,
isn't it?

22:18.602 --> 22:21.805
Hi. Hey,
what are you doing?

22:21.806 --> 22:23.807
This thing's too easy
for randy,

22:23.808 --> 22:25.809
So I tweaked it up
a little bit.

22:25.810 --> 22:30.113
Oh... I hate when you say
that word "tweak."

22:30.114 --> 22:32.515
It makes my hackles go up.

22:32.516 --> 22:35.352
I love
when your hackles go up.

22:36.955 --> 22:38.688
Where's your dad?

22:38.689 --> 22:41.658
It's 20 degrees outside,
and he's out there futzing
with the lincoln.

22:41.659 --> 22:45.528
Watch how hard
this thing hits the net now.

22:45.529 --> 22:51.801
Randy's gonna be a great goalie.
Watch the top-left corner.

22:51.802 --> 22:53.603
<i>(glass shatters)</i>

22:53.604 --> 22:55.839
<i>(colonel)</i> my car!

22:58.309 --> 23:00.243
It was jill!

23:02.913 --> 23:05.548
Fine.
You didn't like the book.

23:05.549 --> 23:08.551
I'll go pick up the boys.
We'll be back at 13 hours.

23:08.552 --> 23:10.487
1300 hours!
