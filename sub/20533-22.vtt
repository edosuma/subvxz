WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:03.629
Previously on 90210:
It's important that we get you

00:03.671 --> 00:06.465
in here for a PET scan and
a biopsy as soon as possible.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.635
You mean that's gonna... tell us
whether or not I have cancer?

00:09.677 --> 00:11.386
Annie, I want you
to buy the Offshore

00:11.428 --> 00:13.263
so that me and Sydney
can move to Australia.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.890
The papers from
the original sale aren't valid.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.517
The seller never signed
one of the documents.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.477
What does that mean?
I means you can't

00:18.519 --> 00:21.188
sell the bar until you get
the former owner to sign this.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.273
All this time I've been hoping
that on some level

00:23.315 --> 00:25.359
Liam still has feelings for me,
but the truth is,

00:25.400 --> 00:26.735
what we had ended long ago.

00:26.777 --> 00:29.822
You kept going on and on
about two girls in your life.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.115
If she's still around
after all this time,
she must be pretty special.

00:32.156 --> 00:35.786
About Old Salty, I...
I couldn't find him,

00:35.828 --> 00:38.038
which means we can't move
to Australia.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.749
You're not going just because
you couldn't get the signature?

00:41.834 --> 00:43.502
That's the only reason?

00:43.544 --> 00:44.419
Yeah.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.796
ANNIE:
I think I have to go.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.923
I can't be
here anymore.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.718
I deserve my own fresh start.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.012
Silver, I know how important
this baby is to you.

00:53.052 --> 00:55.222
I couldn't tell you the day
I went to the doctor.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.766
When I went,
there wasn't a heartbeat.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.810
It was just gone.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.770
DIXON:
Ade wasn't trying to steal

01:01.812 --> 01:03.647
Michaela's song;
Ade wrote it.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.315
Michaela said
she wrote it about you.

01:05.357 --> 01:09.028
(applause, whooping)

01:09.069 --> 01:11.363
(people screaming)
DIXON: Ade! Ade!

01:17.494 --> 01:19.538
(panicked shouts)

01:33.844 --> 01:35.763
Dixon! Dixon!
Annie!

01:37.556 --> 01:39.058
I couldn't see you.
I was so scared.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.642
It's okay. I'm right here.
I'm right here.

01:40.684 --> 01:42.770
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm just shaking.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.688
But I'm fine.
I was in the lobby.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.023
What the hell
happened in there?

01:46.065 --> 01:47.858
Something exploded
under the stage.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.778
There was people running and
screaming and stuff falling.

01:50.819 --> 01:54.114
Oh, my God, Ade was on stage.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.408
And Navid went backstage
to go talk to her.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.286
We got to go see
if they made it out.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.789
Okay, but...
I'm not losing you again.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.582
Come on.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.586
NAOMI (laughs):
No,

02:07.628 --> 02:11.882
I don't want to do an exclusive
on my night with Prince Harry.

02:11.924 --> 02:15.427
$500,000?! My God, what
do you think I did with him?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.304
You know what,
it doesn't matter at all,

02:17.345 --> 02:18.847
because I'm not
going to do it.

02:18.889 --> 02:20.099
This is not happening.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.017
(sighs)
Jordan...

02:22.059 --> 02:24.979
you really shouldn't be here--
the paparazzi are everywhere.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.187
Yeah, well, Mom fired me.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.023
Yeah, she, uh... she said
she didn't want me

02:28.065 --> 02:29.984
to be her chief of staff
anymore.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.819
She thinks I should stay in L.A.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.194
and keep
the publishing company going

02:33.236 --> 02:34.696
because it's "neat."

02:34.738 --> 02:36.698
I'm... happy for you.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.408
Yeah, see...

02:38.450 --> 02:40.285
I know you took the fall
for Elizabeth,

02:40.327 --> 02:41.662
Naomi, but I
also know my mom

02:41.703 --> 02:42.788
wouldn't give me up that easily.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.289
Now, what price
did you have to pay?

02:44.331 --> 02:47.292
Me.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.961
You sacrificed everything
to protect Mark.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.545
I took the blame for Elizabeth

02:50.587 --> 02:52.798
so that you could
have your life back.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.549
Your mother and I are even.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.677
But we can't be together.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.971
I made a deal.

02:59.013 --> 03:02.432
I may be "an evil party
drug girl who ruins lives,"

03:02.474 --> 03:04.351
but I am a woman
of my word.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.770
No, I don't...
I don't accept that.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.606
No. And we'll stand up
to my mother.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.399
Naomi, there's got to be
some way we can

03:11.441 --> 03:13.276
beat her at her own game.
Jordan...

03:13.318 --> 03:14.695
No...
I would love
nothing more

03:14.736 --> 03:16.321
than a chance to have
a relationship,

03:16.363 --> 03:17.990
to be able to hold hands

03:18.032 --> 03:22.201
or jump on a private jet
to Cabo, like normal people.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.164
But we both know
that's not possible.

03:25.204 --> 03:26.748
(laughs)

03:26.790 --> 03:29.334
We tried, but we failed.

03:31.086 --> 03:34.089
You have to go,
and you have to live your life.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.299
And I have to live mine.

03:37.801 --> 03:41.180
You know, uh... I hate this.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.681
It's all
my fault, too.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.725
I knew what kind of nightmare
my mom could be,

03:44.766 --> 03:47.061
and I just never should have
even dragged you into this mess.

03:47.102 --> 03:50.105
Jordan...
I'm happy that you did.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.065
I am.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.566
I'd rather have known you

03:52.607 --> 03:56.028
for a little while than
to never have known you at all.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.823
Bye, Jordan.

04:03.535 --> 04:04.912
(phone rings)

04:07.915 --> 04:09.875
I told you, I am not...

04:09.917 --> 04:11.877
Dixon?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.212
What-what?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.672
(stammers)
What?

04:19.134 --> 04:22.763
This is quite a book
that your ex-girlfriend wrote

04:22.804 --> 04:25.140
about your on-again,
off-again romance.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.642
Yeah, I really haven't read it.

04:27.684 --> 04:28.977
You looking for something?

04:29.019 --> 04:32.147
They have kitchen utensils
in Australia, you know.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.648
I just, I can't find
my passport anywhere.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.400
They're not gonna let me
through security without it.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.944
You already packed it.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.403
(exhales)

04:38.445 --> 04:39.738
And we have plenty of sunscreen.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.531
And your real estate agent

04:41.573 --> 04:42.783
will get Old Salty's
signature

04:42.824 --> 04:44.284
on those sale papers
when we're gone.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.369
It's gonna be okay.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.455
I know. I'm sorry.

04:48.496 --> 04:52.000
I just... keep feeling like
I'm leaving something behind.

04:52.042 --> 04:55.712
Are you sure that you're
not having second thoughts?

04:55.754 --> 04:58.840
No. A fresh start in Australia
is exactly what I need.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.717
(doorbell rings,
knocking at door)

05:00.759 --> 05:02.469
That must be the driver.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.638
MAN: We should
probably get going

05:04.679 --> 05:06.098
if you want to
make your flight.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.390
Traffic's been brutal
ever since that explosion.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.184
What do you mean?
What explosion?

05:09.226 --> 05:10.435
I don't know--
something big happened

05:10.477 --> 05:11.937
at that Spencer Blane tribute.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.734
Um, go.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.153
Make sure your friends are okay.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.445
I'll reschedule the flight.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.827
MAN: Tommy, get that command
post set up for me. Thank you!

05:26.868 --> 05:28.578
Okay, look,
at the present time, no details

05:28.620 --> 05:30.247
are known about
the cause of the explosion.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.331
Three triage centers
have been set up

05:31.372 --> 05:32.916
to deal with the injured,

05:32.958 --> 05:34.793
and we're doing our best
to stabilize the area.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.170
That's all I got. Thank you.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.677
This is insane.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.262
How does something like this
even happen?

05:48.223 --> 05:50.100
Navid.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.019
Oh, thank God you're okay.
We've looked everywhere.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.771
Dude, I've never been so happy
to see anyone in my life.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.815
What happened?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.109
Uh, I was backstage
waiting to talk to Ade,

05:59.151 --> 06:00.777
and next thing I remember,

06:00.819 --> 06:02.529
rescue workers brought me
in here.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.488
There was an explosion.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.781
They're still trying
to figure out

06:04.823 --> 06:06.741
exactly what caused it.
Where's-where's Ade?

06:06.783 --> 06:08.576
We haven't seen her.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.619
ANNIE:
We checked

06:09.661 --> 06:10.704
all of the triage centers.

06:10.745 --> 06:11.872
We called the hospitals.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.290
We were hoping
she was here with you.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.916
(exhales)

06:17.211 --> 06:18.753
Navid, uh...

06:20.255 --> 06:21.840
Uh, excuse me, sir?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.009
Our friend was on the stage;
we need to know if she's okay.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.135
We've got a preliminary list

06:25.177 --> 06:26.385
of people who evacuated
the theater.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.013
She was right there on the stage
where it happened.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.097
I-I understand.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.099
Look, we had
a crowded theater.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.559
It's a chaotic situation.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.061
I don't know
how many people are injured.

06:34.102 --> 06:34.978
I don't know how many people
are trapped.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.104
All right?
But I can't send my men

06:36.146 --> 06:38.023
in there until the area
has been stabilized.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.440
Okay, but if she's in there,
you need to help her.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.109
Look, the bomb squad
has been notified,

06:41.151 --> 06:43.237
but it can take up to
three hours for them to give us

06:43.278 --> 06:45.113
the all clear.
I know it's hard,

06:45.155 --> 06:47.115
but what I need you guys to do
is hang tight.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.909
Okay? Excuse me.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.994
Hey, Jimmy, I need you to set
up that command center now!

06:51.036 --> 06:52.746
Let's go!
Navid, Navid,
where are you going?

06:52.787 --> 06:54.831
I got to go get Ade.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.882
Ade! Ade!

07:03.924 --> 07:04.925
MAN:
Hey, stop!

07:04.966 --> 07:07.010
Don't go in there!

07:13.975 --> 07:16.811
(theme music playing)

07:32.035 --> 07:33.453
(sirens wailing)

07:33.494 --> 07:35.247
(indistinct radio communication)

07:41.461 --> 07:42.462
Hey!

07:42.503 --> 07:44.381
Sil... Silver!

07:44.423 --> 07:45.673
Hey, I came as
soon as I heard.

07:45.715 --> 07:48.468
Is everyone okay?
What happened?
I don't know.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.720
I only know what I heard on
the radio; when I got in my car

07:50.762 --> 07:52.513
after my doctor's appointment,
it was all over the news.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.765
I just can't believe it.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.017
Yesterday, I basically
called Ade a hateful bitch.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.102
I thought it was her fault

07:57.144 --> 07:58.478
that Michaela was leaving,
but it wasn't.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.272
And now that's all I can think,
that maybe that was

08:00.314 --> 08:01.689
the last thing
that I ever said to her.

08:01.731 --> 08:02.983
Okay, you can't think like that.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.401
You got to stay positive.

08:06.527 --> 08:08.405
Oh, my God. Annie?

08:12.909 --> 08:14.577
I'm sorry.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.121
Don't worry.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.039
We're gonna find her.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.041
DIXON:
Guys!
Oh, my God.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.501
Dixon, thank God you're okay.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.836
Dixon,
where's everyone else?

08:22.877 --> 08:24.171
Uh, Navid and Annie made it out.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.755
Uh, we still think
Ade is in there.

08:25.797 --> 08:26.965
So Navid ran in after her.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.091
Oh, my God.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.884
I got to find
the fire chief.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.636
Ade!

08:32.679 --> 08:34.722
Hello?

08:37.351 --> 08:39.394
Ade, where are you?

08:40.979 --> 08:43.231
Can you hear me?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.317
(buzzing, popping)

08:48.820 --> 08:50.864
Ade, please answer me.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.619
(pops)

08:58.079 --> 08:59.206
Ade!

09:02.834 --> 09:04.752
Ade?

09:04.794 --> 09:06.838
Ade, where are you?

09:12.135 --> 09:14.804
Hello!

09:18.599 --> 09:20.519
Can you hear me?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.603
Hello?

09:25.648 --> 09:27.650
Ade!

09:31.821 --> 09:33.532
Ade!

09:33.573 --> 09:35.325
Navid?

09:35.367 --> 09:37.327
(coughing)
Ade, where are you?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.873
(weakly):
Navid?

09:41.915 --> 09:43.208
Ade, please answer me.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.751
Navid?

09:45.668 --> 09:47.128
Navid!

09:47.170 --> 09:48.213
Ade?

09:48.255 --> 09:49.548
Navid, I'm here.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.551
Navid? Navid?

09:52.592 --> 09:53.843
Ade, can you hear me?

09:53.885 --> 09:55.303
I'm here.

10:05.564 --> 10:06.856
Are you okay?

10:06.898 --> 10:08.191
I'm stuck.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.700
(crying)

10:20.495 --> 10:22.539
(whimper)

10:22.581 --> 10:24.207
Hey.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.501
I'm gonna get you out
of here, all right?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.711
Okay.

10:28.753 --> 10:29.837
(groaning and panting)

10:29.879 --> 10:31.465
(grunting)

10:31.506 --> 10:33.049
(whimpers)

10:33.091 --> 10:36.386
(debris clattering)

10:36.428 --> 10:38.179
(panting)

10:40.681 --> 10:41.975
Hey!

10:42.016 --> 10:43.226
Uh, excuse me. Um,

10:43.268 --> 10:44.727
our friend just ran
inside of the building.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.187
I just actually got a
call from law enforcement.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.022
They said a civilian
jumped the perimeter.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.567
I'll call bomb squad and let 'em
know there's somebody in there.

10:50.609 --> 10:52.152
(phone ringing)
One second.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.112
This is him. Navid?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.864
Oh, my God, uh, did you
find her? Is she okay?

10:56.906 --> 10:59.367
Yeah, uh, her
foot is hurt. Uh,

10:59.409 --> 11:00.994
but she's fine.
We're stuck.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.745
She's okay.
Uh, they're stuck.

11:02.787 --> 11:04.456
You have
to do something.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.457
Give me the phone.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.042
Hey, is this the wannabe hero

11:08.084 --> 11:09.669
that jumped
into the accident site?

11:09.710 --> 11:11.004
Yeah, it's me.

11:11.045 --> 11:12.880
Okay, good. I'm glad
your friend is okay,

11:12.922 --> 11:14.715
but what you did was
incredibly dangerous.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.010
Look, a secondary load
could shift and collapse.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.053
There's tons of electrical
wires everywhere.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.054
Do not move her.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.722
Do not move yourself,
or you could bring

11:21.764 --> 11:23.224
the whole thing down
on your heads.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.601
Do you understand me?

11:24.643 --> 11:25.684
Okay. Thank you.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.061
I'll let her know.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.064
Hey.
What did he say?

11:30.106 --> 11:32.233
Says everything's
gonna be okay.
Oh, good.

11:33.652 --> 11:36.946
Okay.
(crying)

11:39.032 --> 11:40.992
So, what do we do?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.077
We wait.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.380
NAOMI:
No, I can still...

11:53.421 --> 11:54.548
I can still do it.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.216
Well, you're just
a highly negative person.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.842
Thank you very much.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.135
Ugh! It's official.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.971
My Prince Harry debacle
has officially

12:02.013 --> 12:04.349
scared off every one
of my clients.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.642
Ironically, people don't want

12:05.684 --> 12:07.477
a wild party girl
planning their parties.

12:07.519 --> 12:08.936
(laughs)
But I'm okay.

12:08.978 --> 12:12.399
I'm alive. I'm not
stuck under rubble.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.108
I'll just wait
this scandal out.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.818
I mean, how long
did it take people

12:15.860 --> 12:17.654
to stop thinking about
Monica Lewinsky and the cigar?

12:17.696 --> 12:19.906
And the dress. I mean,
who keeps the dress?

12:19.947 --> 12:22.534
Oh, my God.
I'm going to be a party girl

12:22.576 --> 12:25.704
drug whore
for the rest of my life?

12:26.705 --> 12:28.164
(sighs)

12:31.167 --> 12:32.877
Oh, what was that all about?

12:32.919 --> 12:35.046
Uh, I just helped that mom
find her son.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.673
She'd been looking
for him for hours.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.550
I'm gonna see you guys
in a second.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.758
I want to see
if the rescue workers

12:39.800 --> 12:41.010
need any help with anything.

12:41.052 --> 12:42.845
You know, water
or something.
Mm-hmm.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.764
He's, like, effortlessly
the opposite of me.
(laughs)

12:45.806 --> 12:47.684
Maybe I should
pass out some waters,

12:47.726 --> 12:49.603
and then people would think
I'm a good person.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.230
Or you could just
do it to be helpful.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.856
Oh, my God, you're right.

12:53.898 --> 12:57.402
This whole helping others idea
is-is genius!

12:57.444 --> 12:59.237
I have to go make
some phone calls.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.155
Mmm.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.324
Where is she going?
Oh, just hatching

13:03.366 --> 13:05.326
some sort of plan.
I didn't ask.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.703
Probably best.
Yeah.

13:06.745 --> 13:09.748
Okay, I went home, I got a bunch
of books to give out

13:09.788 --> 13:11.207
for people who are waiting.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.005
Hey, for the record,

13:18.047 --> 13:20.216
when Liam got here,
he was really worried about you.

13:20.258 --> 13:23.762
He was worried
about all of us.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.846
Besides, he's still going
to Australia with Sydney,

13:25.888 --> 13:28.266
taking the easy way out,
like he always does.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.310
You okay with that?
No.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.019
But unlike in my book,

13:32.061 --> 13:34.397
life isn't a story
you get to make up.

13:34.439 --> 13:35.898
I can't write

13:35.940 --> 13:37.816
my own happy ending.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.319
I already tried.
It didn't work.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.987
You're both still here,
aren't you?

13:41.028 --> 13:44.240
All I'm saying is,
everything happens for a reason.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.495
(sighs)

13:52.749 --> 13:55.001
ADRIANNA:
How old is that granola bar?

13:55.042 --> 13:56.711
Yeah. Not sure.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.172
It's been a really long time
since I wore this jacket.

13:59.213 --> 14:00.507
(laughs)

14:00.548 --> 14:02.300
Well, thank you.
Yeah.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.635
Not just for the granola bar.

14:03.677 --> 14:07.972
But for, you know,
rushing in and rescuing me.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.308
Yeah, I'm macho that way.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.101
(crunching)

14:12.143 --> 14:14.604
But I know it doesn't
get me off the hook

14:14.646 --> 14:17.106
for, uh, not believing
you've changed?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.652
No, I think
risking your life

14:20.694 --> 14:22.987
and saving me kind of counts
as an apology.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.533
So, in terms of,
uh, you and me--

14:26.574 --> 14:27.826
you think, uh...?

14:27.867 --> 14:29.828
I-I need to know
that you can trust me.

14:31.078 --> 14:33.707
So, I think that we should
take things slow.

14:33.748 --> 14:34.749
I'm down with slow, yeah.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.584
Mm-hmm.
The slower,
the better.

14:36.626 --> 14:40.171
Slow cooking,
slow dancing.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.632
Long, slow kisses.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.223
Wait. I'm serious.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.016
This is our second chance.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.727
I want to get it right.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.563
So, let's just focus
on getting out of here,

14:56.604 --> 14:59.023
and then we'll just see
how it goes, okay?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.900
Okay.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.276
How's your foot?

15:02.318 --> 15:05.864
Oh, it hurts,
but it could be worse.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.575
Had Michaela not freaked out
about performing and run off,

15:08.616 --> 15:11.160
she would be trapped under here,
pregnant with Silver's baby.

15:11.202 --> 15:14.205
So, I guess that's
the bright spot in the day.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.917
Uh, Ade, um...

15:17.958 --> 15:21.838
Michaela didn't run off
because she had stage fright.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.676
She lost the baby.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.102
So, I guess you
missed your flight.

15:36.143 --> 15:38.062
(scoffs)

15:38.104 --> 15:40.189
Yeah, guess you missed yours.

15:40.231 --> 15:44.527
Yeah, well, Silver thinks
things happen for a reason.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.781
Well, I guess the only thing
to do when you miss your flight

15:47.822 --> 15:49.699
is to book another one.

15:50.909 --> 15:55.079
But Paris-- that's...
that's great.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.916
I mean, it's-it's good that
you're gonna get a fresh start.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.250
Yeah.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.752
Like you in Australia.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.921
Yeah. Yeah, I think

16:02.962 --> 16:05.172
Syd actually moved the tickets
to later today.

16:05.214 --> 16:06.466
Did she?

16:06.507 --> 16:08.342
What a peach. Anyway,

16:08.384 --> 16:10.970
thinking about you and Sydney
in Australia is super fun,

16:11.011 --> 16:14.432
but I'm going to go help Naomi
with whatever it is she's doing.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.769
Your advice sucks.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.030
Oh, thank you for coming
to Naomi Clark's Rescue Relief.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.032
Have a T-shirt.
There you go.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.409
I think that's
your size.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.620
Thank you.
Oh, hi!

16:35.662 --> 16:38.080
Look at that.
Oh.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.874
Voilà.
Mmm, wow.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.419
I can't believe you threw
together a major relief benefit

16:43.461 --> 16:44.754
in three hours.
Ugh!

16:44.796 --> 16:46.046
I know. I am a miracle worker.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.882
Or that is what the press
will say about me.

16:47.924 --> 16:52.470
Aha. And I am very
happy for you, but, um,

16:52.512 --> 16:56.516
how much of this is actually
about helping the relief effort,

16:56.557 --> 16:59.853
and how much is about
helping transform your image?

16:59.894 --> 17:01.103
What makes you say that?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.563
Oh, I don't know.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.315
The T-shirts with
your face on them,

17:04.357 --> 17:06.317
or the fact that
the press is here.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.359
Oh, would you not be

17:07.401 --> 17:08.694
such a conscience
on my shoulder, please?

17:08.736 --> 17:11.030
The press was in the vicinity
'cause they were covering

17:11.070 --> 17:12.323
the explosion.
Mmm.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.409
WOMAN:
No news yet on the
amount of damage caused

17:15.451 --> 17:16.786
by last night's
incident...

17:16.828 --> 17:18.579
But we are all
very worried about

17:18.621 --> 17:20.580
everyone involved
in the explosion.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.876
I myself have two friends
trapped in the rubble.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.127
Hi. I'm Naomi Clark.

17:25.169 --> 17:26.671
All proceeds
from ticket sales

17:26.713 --> 17:28.715
for Naomi Clark's
Rescue Relief are going

17:28.756 --> 17:30.591
to help the victims
of the collapse.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.678
So come on down,
get some great-tasting taquitos,

17:33.720 --> 17:35.346
take your mind
off the trauma.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.639
And in 20 minutes,

17:36.681 --> 17:38.391
the Goo Goo Dolls
are taking the stage.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.642
Thank you.

17:39.684 --> 17:40.727
(laughs)

17:43.938 --> 17:46.983
Oh, shut up.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.903
(phone ringing)

17:49.944 --> 17:51.863
Navid.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.741
No, it's me.

17:54.782 --> 17:58.036
Adrianna, I'm-I'm so...
I'm so, so sorry.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.370
Are you all right?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.539
I wanted to see
if you were doing okay.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.624
Navid told me
about the baby.

18:03.666 --> 18:07.045
And I just want you to know that

18:07.086 --> 18:09.047
I know exactly how you feel.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.299
I, um... I can't believe
that after everything I said

18:12.341 --> 18:14.510
and everything
that's happened, you're...

18:14.552 --> 18:16.429
you're worried about me.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.181
Yeah, well,
what are friends for?

18:19.223 --> 18:21.392
You know, it doesn't matter

18:21.434 --> 18:24.979
if we steal
one another's boyfriend,

18:25.021 --> 18:28.482
or push each other in the pool.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.443
I mean, you were so amazing,

18:30.484 --> 18:34.113
and you forgave me
for all the things I did,

18:34.154 --> 18:35.823
and you got past it, so...

18:35.865 --> 18:38.576
the least I can do
is return the favor.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.244
Thank you.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.537
You're amazing.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.122
True. (laughs)

18:43.163 --> 18:44.624
And when I get out of here,

18:44.665 --> 18:46.709
I think you totally
owe me a spa day.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.045
(phone beeping)
Deal.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.674
Um, you should probably
save your battery.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.427
Uh, hey, I'm-I'm really glad
that we talked.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.720
Me, too.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.764
Bye.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.936
(sighs)
Hello.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.186
DR. BROOKS:
Erin?

19:06.228 --> 19:07.480
Yes.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.898
It's Dr. Brooks.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.401
We got your biopsy
and PET scan results.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.404
I'm afraid you've tested
positive for malignancy.

19:15.446 --> 19:17.406
You have cancer.

19:17.448 --> 19:20.493
(sighs)

19:31.629 --> 19:33.756
(sighs)

19:35.967 --> 19:37.468
Thanks.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.220
I don't know about you,
but I'm freaking out.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.264
I mean, one minute I'm listening
to music, and the next...

19:42.306 --> 19:44.058
I wasn't in there,
but it must have been crazy.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.559
I didn't even know
what was going on.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.269
And then the crowd
started to panic.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.479
Is that when
you got hurt?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.230
Yeah, some guy
knocked me over.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.524
He didn't even
know I was there.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.192
And then they
just kept running.

19:53.233 --> 19:56.236
If a friend hadn't helped
me up, I don't know.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.906
You never know
when something's gonna happen

19:58.948 --> 20:00.867
that will change everything.

20:02.576 --> 20:03.786
DIXON:
Hey, Sil.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.454
Could you go get
some more bandages?

20:05.496 --> 20:07.206
Uh, I think
we just ran out.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.248
Oh, yeah, sure.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.710
Probably best to stay busy.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.378
Good luck.
Thank you.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.588
Hey, man.
We are almost out of water.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.798
I just got to
call Sydney.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.008
Have her meet me
at the Offshore.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.801
We can bring back
some food, too.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.845
Maybe you should
ask Annie to help you.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.055
It's just water and chips.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.848
I think Sydney and I
can handle that.

20:23.890 --> 20:24.849
Yeah, I know,

20:24.891 --> 20:26.934
but, um, I think
you would want to see Annie

20:26.976 --> 20:30.521
before she goes on the tour
and doesn't come back... ever.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.565
Annie's leaving for good?

20:32.606 --> 20:33.900
Why would she do that?

20:33.941 --> 20:35.275
Gee, I don't know.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.028
Maybe it's because
of a certain torch

20:37.070 --> 20:40.073
that she's holding for a certain
brooding superhero.

20:40.114 --> 20:42.700
Look, letting your sister go
is what's best for both of us.

20:42.742 --> 20:43.868
Trust me.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.329
Man, you have a hell of a way

20:47.371 --> 20:49.165
of showing that you care
about somebody.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.958
Look, do what
you want, okay?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.461
But if it was me,
I wouldn't let the moment go.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.550
NAOMI:
Thank you for coming out.

Yeah, there's something wrong.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.734
We're missing the Goo Goo Dolls.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.321
Like, Naomi couldn't
have gotten them

22:43.361 --> 22:45.156
to play at my, uh,
Christmas party

22:45.198 --> 22:46.782

22:51.912 --> 22:53.789

22:53.831 --> 22:55.833

23:09.387 --> 23:10.931
There's a gas leak.

23:10.973 --> 23:12.975
The utility company thought
they turned everything off,

23:13.017 --> 23:15.936
but apparently there's a line
under the theater that ruptured.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.064
What's the ETA on the
utility company crew?

23:18.105 --> 23:19.940
Some concert
is blocking the plaza.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.276
They're having a problem
getting the equipment through.

You don't have to answer that.

You have to stop the concert.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.549

23:53.015 --> 23:54.934
and there's been a gas leak
at the theater,

23:54.975 --> 23:57.019
and the equipment needs to come
through this plaza.

I need you to move
out of the plaza area

Adrianna, it's going
to be fine, okay?

24:39.979 --> 24:41.272
It's, uh... emergency crew
just got through, okay?

24:41.314 --> 24:42.982
Now they just have to find
the source of the leak.

24:43.023 --> 24:43.941
Yeah, but what if
they don't?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.234
Let's not think about that.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.735
Let's-let's focus
on the future.

24:46.777 --> 24:48.154
Okay. I am.
All right?

24:48.195 --> 24:49.780
Good.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.031
I was wrong.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.033
If we get out of here,

24:53.075 --> 24:54.994
I don't want to see
how things go.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.536
I don't want
to take things slow.

24:56.578 --> 24:57.579
Yeah.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.872
Because the way it goes...

24:58.914 --> 25:00.874
is that you're always the one.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.085
When I was pregnant,

25:03.127 --> 25:04.420
and you weren't even the father,

25:04.462 --> 25:06.339
you were there.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.590
Through everything
I've gone through in my career,

25:08.632 --> 25:10.926
you've been there.

25:10.968 --> 25:13.179
And now you practically run
through a burning building

25:13.220 --> 25:14.972
to save me?

25:15.014 --> 25:17.016
So no, I don't want
to take things slow.

25:17.057 --> 25:19.018
I don't care if that's
the right thing

25:19.059 --> 25:21.354
or the smart thing...

25:21.395 --> 25:23.730
because for me,

25:23.772 --> 25:25.941
that's the only thing.
Hey.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.402
Maybe we needed to walk away
from each other so many times

25:28.444 --> 25:31.447
because that's the only
way to come full circle.

25:31.489 --> 25:32.572
Huh?
Yeah.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.033
To get back to
where we belong.

25:34.074 --> 25:36.869
So, when we get
out of here,

25:36.910 --> 25:38.620
okay, we're not gonna
waste any more time.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.331
Okay?
Okay.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.249
We're gonna get a
place, with a yard,

25:42.291 --> 25:44.210
for the dog that we'll get.
(laughs)

25:44.251 --> 25:46.879
And, of course, there'll be
a room for a studio and...

25:46.920 --> 25:47.921
and a fireplace.

25:47.963 --> 25:48.839
Do you promise?

25:48.881 --> 25:50.632
(whispering):
Promise.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.093
'Cause you are going to spend
a lot of time in my arms.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.094
(sobs)

25:54.136 --> 25:55.221
I love you.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.305
I love you.

25:58.556 --> 26:00.684

26:00.726 --> 26:03.479
(mechanical whirring)

26:03.521 --> 26:04.522
What's that?

26:04.562 --> 26:05.772
What is it?
(glass breaking)

26:05.814 --> 26:07.066
That's a good sign,
right?

26:07.107 --> 26:08.442
Yeah.
MAN: The gas leak
has stopped.

26:08.484 --> 26:09.776
We're going to get
you out of there

26:09.818 --> 26:11.237
as soon as we can.
Oh...

26:11.278 --> 26:14.281
Yeah, that's a
really good sign!
Yes!

26:14.323 --> 26:16.616
(laughing)
We're... we're over here!

26:16.658 --> 26:17.910
Hello!

26:17.951 --> 26:20.246
(Navid whoops)

26:20.287 --> 26:21.372
Hey.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.790
The rescue workers got through,

26:23.832 --> 26:25.000
and they stopped the gas leak.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.168
(sighs)

26:26.210 --> 26:27.920
Ade and Navid
are going to be fine.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.629
Thank God.
Yeah.

26:29.671 --> 26:32.590
Hey, I'm sorry for being
so scoldy earlier.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.510
I know you just
wanted to help.

26:34.552 --> 26:36.387
I called USA National,

26:36.429 --> 26:38.931
and I gave them the
exclusive interview

26:38.972 --> 26:40.558
about my wild night
with Prince Harry.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.017
What? Why?

26:42.059 --> 26:43.894
I thought you didn't
want to be known

26:43.936 --> 26:45.979
as the wild party druggie girl.

26:46.021 --> 26:49.024
Well, I had to refund the
ticket money from the concert,

26:49.066 --> 26:51.777
and I promised that I would
donate to the rescue efforts,

26:51.818 --> 26:54.321
so I took the 500 grand
from the interview

26:54.363 --> 26:56.031
and gave it to the Red Cross.

26:56.073 --> 26:59.617
So... maybe, at the end of the
day, I did some actual good.

26:59.659 --> 27:01.370
I'm proud of you, Naomi.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.247
You are a good person.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.832
There may only be
a select few of us

27:05.874 --> 27:07.209
out there who realize it,

27:07.251 --> 27:08.502
but you're one of
the best I know.

27:08.544 --> 27:09.627
(laughing):
Uh-huh.

27:09.669 --> 27:11.004
(both laughing)

27:11.046 --> 27:12.756
NAOMI: Oh, God.
Dragon lady, 11:00.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.883
Ooh, she walks mean.
Good luck.

27:16.552 --> 27:17.386
(sighs)

27:17.428 --> 27:18.887
CHERYL:
Naomi.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.515
I see that you decided
to aid the relief effort

27:21.557 --> 27:22.849
by throwing a
raging party.

27:22.891 --> 27:23.934
No surprise.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.227
And I heard about
your little article.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.812
Yeah, well, don't worry.

27:26.853 --> 27:28.564
I didn't mention Elizabeth
or your fancy family.

27:28.606 --> 27:31.066
It turns out
that your tell-all story

27:31.108 --> 27:32.776
was a wake-up call
for Prince Harry,

27:32.818 --> 27:34.361
who has agreed to go to rehab.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.281
And the emperor

27:37.323 --> 27:39.283
would very much like
to meet the girl

27:39.325 --> 27:41.452
who convinced his son
to finally get the help

27:41.494 --> 27:42.702
that he needs.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.038
It's not a condition
of our talks,

27:45.080 --> 27:46.373
but it would make
the emperor happy.

27:46.415 --> 27:49.293
So you need me
to do a favor for you?

27:49.335 --> 27:51.003
Yeah.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.506
And, of course, if you're
willing to do my mom this favor,

27:53.547 --> 27:57.050
I'm sure she will
repay you somehow.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.177
(laughing):
Okay.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.470
Well, if the terms are right,

27:59.512 --> 28:01.263
then I'm sure
I can do her a solid.

28:01.305 --> 28:04.057
I don't even know
what that means.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.977
It means you owe Naomi
an apology.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.062
Congratulations, Naomi.

28:09.104 --> 28:12.316
It seems that your amateur
spin machine worked this time.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.691
That wasn't an apology,

28:13.733 --> 28:15.361
and it isn't spin.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.821
Naomi is a good person.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.658
So, I have a new
arrangement for you.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.118
Naomi's going to fly to D.C.,

28:23.160 --> 28:24.953
help you out
with Emperor Nagato,

28:24.995 --> 28:26.830
and then Naomi and I

28:26.872 --> 28:30.334

at her own game.

28:45.432 --> 28:46.725
Oh, my gosh.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.602
Which means
that we can...

28:48.644 --> 28:51.271
do this.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.649
And... this.

Okay, good. Um...

29:02.824 --> 29:04.159
I think there's some
trash bags behind the bar.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.327
Can you grab them?
Yeah.

29:13.835 --> 29:16.963
I thought you said you couldn't
get Old Salty's signature.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.884
Huh. The, um...

29:20.926 --> 29:23.303

had him come in and sign.

con artist, Liam.

29:25.723 --> 29:27.391

ahead to the part

29:27.433 --> 29:29.017
where you tell me
what's going on.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.776

nothing between you and Annie.

at each other at the theater,

29:58.464 --> 30:00.006
Neither should you.

The truth is, it doesn't
matter what's between us.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.055
Because...

30:07.097 --> 30:09.642

every time we try.

30:09.683 --> 30:12.603
That's the guy I am,
and Annie knows it.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.396
No, she doesn't.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.695
You need to read
the end of her book.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.033
I better go.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.744
I have a flight to catch.
