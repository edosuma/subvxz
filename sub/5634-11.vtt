00:01.710 --> 00:05.047
<i>It seems today</i>
<i>that all you see</i>

00:05.130 --> 00:08.217
<i>Is violence in movies</i>
<i>and sex on TV</i>

00:08.300 --> 00:12.095
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.179 --> 00:15.098
<i> On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:18.352
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:21.897
<i>Lucky there's a man</i>
<i>who positively can do</i>

00:21.980 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:25.150
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:25.234 --> 00:30.239
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:34.743 --> 00:36.662
We now return to Wes Anderson's

00:36.745 --> 00:39.790
<i>Pan Up, Pan Down,</i>
<i>French Song, The End.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:45.420
<i>Viens, suis-moi</i>

00:45.504 --> 00:47.172
<i>Je connais une route...</i>

00:47.256 --> 00:49.049
Wow, that was amazing, I think!

00:49.132 --> 00:50.926
All right, everyone,

00:51.009 --> 00:52.511
it's time to open up our bank statements.

00:52.594 --> 00:55.013
Let's gather 'round for prayer.

00:55.097 --> 00:57.099
Hey, God, it's the Griffins.

00:57.182 --> 01:00.310
Again, we're very sorry
we cyber-bullied that girl to death.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.187
But we still want a snowmobile.

01:02.271 --> 01:05.065
Today, though, please let there be money
in our bank account.

01:05.148 --> 01:06.817
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.236
Damn it. It didn't work.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.904
We're still poor.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.490
Peter, every month our savings
get smaller and smaller.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.827
We really gotta figure out a better way
to budget for this family's future.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.120
Bitcoin.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.204
- What?
- I don't know.

01:19.288 --> 01:20.706
This is serious.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.624
We need to think
about our kids' education.

01:22.708 --> 01:25.335
Of course, it's already too late
for Meg to go to college.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.838
And Chris is too dumb
to get in anywhere.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.089
Yay!

01:29.173 --> 01:30.215
No, Chris. Not yay.

01:30.299 --> 01:32.259
But there's still time for Stewie.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.469
Let's sit down later
and see if we can figure out

01:34.553 --> 01:36.221
a plan to get our finances in order.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.723
Eh, don't worry about it, Lois.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.433
I will always provide for the family.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.310
Even if I have to shoot our dinner.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.274
This will look great in my study.

01:47.357 --> 01:48.984
I'm a hunter,

01:49.067 --> 01:51.153
but I'm a silly hunter.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.246
Hey, don't fill up on that.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.789
We got breakfast coming.

02:02.873 --> 02:06.960
Hey, Peter, I think I figured out one way
we can save money for Stewie's college.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.588
If we bundle our cable
and Internet together,

02:09.671 --> 02:12.007
we can save $14 a month.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.259
No! Bundling is a sign of defeat!

02:14.343 --> 02:16.303
Plus, I figured out something better.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.388
- A metal detector.
- What?

02:18.472 --> 02:20.557
Yeah, it combines two of America's
greatest resources,

02:20.641 --> 02:21.892
garbage and luck.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.185
That's stupid, Peter.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.603
Ah, you're just saying that

02:24.686 --> 02:26.355
because the battery it uses
causes bladder cancer.

02:26.438 --> 02:27.814
Well, then, I'm off.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.816
I shall be at the beach
looking for valuables

02:29.900 --> 02:31.735
and occasionally using
a doorless bathroom.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.153
Good day, madam.

02:37.115 --> 02:40.244
We now return to
The Awkward Stepdad Show.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.788
Man, your mom's a real groaner.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.498
Do you hear that in your room?

02:44.581 --> 02:47.209
Hey, Dad, where are you going?

02:47.292 --> 02:49.419
Well, Meg, now that
I'm a metal detector guy,

02:49.503 --> 02:52.130
I gotta start eating breakfast
at on-the-sand cafÃ©s,

02:52.214 --> 02:55.717
where I will judge tourists
as my skin browns and hardens.

02:55.801 --> 02:59.805
Stop throwing your kid's diapers
in the trash with all the soda cans!

03:03.517 --> 03:06.144
Hey, Lois, check out what
I found with my metal detector.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.232
Are those... Are those Purple Hearts?

03:10.315 --> 03:12.067
Yeah, some idiot buried,
like, a hundred of 'em

03:12.150 --> 03:13.652
in this big lawn under these bone cages.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.279
Peter!

03:15.362 --> 03:17.823
I think you desecrated
a military graveyard!

03:17.906 --> 03:21.076
Hey, guys, like four jeeps
just drove up onto our front yard.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.452
They must be here for the medals!

03:22.536 --> 03:24.413
Maybe. Or it could be because of my

03:24.496 --> 03:26.915
"I'm Gonna Barf
on the White House" blog.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.300
Ah, sweet!

03:36.383 --> 03:38.093
Huh.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.179
Wonder what happens if I turn it
on and point 'em at each other.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.058
Oh, my God!

03:45.142 --> 03:50.230
Did you also call into a talk show
without turning down your radio first?

03:52.316 --> 03:55.319
- Jackpot.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.778
Wow, an iPad!

03:56.862 --> 03:58.113
This thing finds everything!

03:58.197 --> 04:00.115
- Engagement ring!

04:00.199 --> 04:01.909
- Family locket!

04:01.992 --> 04:03.911
- Sunglasses that are an upgrade

04:03.994 --> 04:06.330
- over my current pair!
- There he is!

04:06.413 --> 04:09.124
There's the guy who's been
stealing everyone's stuff!

04:09.208 --> 04:11.585
Don't yell at me, I'm very sunburned!

04:11.668 --> 04:14.838
- Go, crappy car, go!

04:19.343 --> 04:21.470
Peter, did you rob a bunch of people

04:21.553 --> 04:23.347
on the beach
with your metal detector?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.890
Well, that's only half the story.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.934
I also hooted at a lady
who was breastfeeding.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.436
I want you to get rid
of that metal detector.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.146
All you're doing is getting into trouble

04:31.230 --> 04:33.148
and digging up junk when we really need

04:33.232 --> 04:34.733
to be saving for Stewie's college.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.318
Tomorrow we are going to the mall

04:36.401 --> 04:38.362
and returning that thing to the store.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.947
Okay, fine.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.282
But you should know,
the day I bought this metal detector

04:42.366 --> 04:44.743
was the happiest day of my life.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.746
Well, obviously, the second happiest.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.792
<i>Now we gonna do this thing</i>
<i>a little different tonight</i>

04:53.418 --> 04:58.549
<i>You gonna come over</i>
<i>pick me up in your ride</i>

04:58.632 --> 05:01.176
Oh, my God,
I wasn't even supposed to be here.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.345
I passed out at the Tom Petty
concert last night

05:03.428 --> 05:04.513
and just stayed.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.391
<i>You're gonna open my door</i>

05:07.474 --> 05:10.769
<i>And I'm gonna reach over</i>
<i>and open yours</i>

05:10.853 --> 05:13.981
<i>Gonna pay for dinner</i>
<i>take me to see a movie</i>

05:14.064 --> 05:17.276
<i>And whisper in my ear how bad</i>
<i>you really want to do me...</i>

05:17.359 --> 05:19.194
Please, go slow.

05:19.278 --> 05:20.654
I have IBS.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.954
Well, I'm glad the store was willing
to take that metal detector back.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.414
All right, let's go to the food court.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.207
I love eating Panda Express

05:32.291 --> 05:34.376
while squeezin' our purchases
between our knees

05:34.459 --> 05:35.586
'cause someone
might grab 'em.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.754
God, the mall sucks,
doesn't it, kids?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.548
If I had a credit card,
I'd shop online.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.216
Oh, hey, Bonnie.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.467
What are you guys doing here?

05:42.551 --> 05:43.886
Oh, hey, Lois.

05:43.969 --> 05:45.888
We saw an ad looking for a toddler

05:45.971 --> 05:47.598
to appear in a peanut
butter commercial

05:47.681 --> 05:50.017
and we thought
we'd bring Susie.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.603
- Joe, are you wearing a corsage?
- Yeah.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.688
You can get a really good deal
on them after prom season.

05:54.771 --> 05:55.981
They're for girls, Joe.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.399
Hey, Peter,

05:57.482 --> 06:00.360
why don't you let me do me,
and you do you, okay?

06:00.444 --> 06:02.237
Peanut butter commercial, huh?

06:02.321 --> 06:03.822
Hey, Bri, maybe you should audition.

06:03.906 --> 06:06.033
You know, because of that
one time you got in the trash

06:06.116 --> 06:08.035
and ate a whole jar of
recalled peanut butter?

06:08.118 --> 06:09.620
It wasn't peanut butter.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.371
It was that pre-mixed peanut
butter and jelly thing.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.040
Oh, Mom bought that?

06:13.123 --> 06:15.626
That's what the scab kid
at school always has!

06:15.709 --> 06:17.377
That was really great, Jake.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.629
Really, really great.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.547
Your face is upside-down,

06:20.631 --> 06:22.591
so we're not gonna pick you,
but thanks for coming.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.426
Hey. Hey. This is you.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.429
"I'm Brian. I like garbage peanut butter,

06:27.513 --> 06:30.265
"and I wear my 'I Voted' sticker
for a week and a half."

06:30.349 --> 06:31.558
Num-num-num-num-num-
num-num-num-num!

06:32.726 --> 06:34.269
I'm sorry, we're looking for

06:34.353 --> 06:35.521
more of a
"Num-num-num-num-num-num-num."

06:35.604 --> 06:38.273
Bob, look over there!

06:38.357 --> 06:40.526
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-
num-num-num-num-num!

06:42.152 --> 06:43.445
Whose kid is that?

06:43.529 --> 06:45.239
Oh, that's our son, Stewie.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.532
He's adorable!

06:46.615 --> 06:48.450
And exactly what we're looking for!

06:48.534 --> 06:52.371
Congratulations, your son
is the new peanut butter kid!

06:52.454 --> 06:54.373
My God, I don't believe it!

06:54.456 --> 06:55.874
That's so cool!

06:55.958 --> 06:57.960
Hey, what's Dad doing
over there with Chris?

06:58.043 --> 07:00.879
Oh, he's telling him
that he's no longer his favorite son.

07:04.383 --> 07:05.884
No!

07:05.968 --> 07:08.679
No, Daddy!

07:08.762 --> 07:12.099
Daddy!

07:12.182 --> 07:14.059
Daddy...

07:21.149 --> 07:23.068
I didn't even tell him.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.945
He just does not like to be touched.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.453
Thanks for coming to the viewing party

07:33.537 --> 07:35.581
for Stewie's commercial, everybody.

07:35.664 --> 07:38.458
We're sorry that it's airing
during <i>2 Broke Girls,</i>

07:38.542 --> 07:40.544
but we have no control over that.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.629
Thanks for coming to my big night, Brian.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.549
I see you got all dressed up
in your exposed wiener.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.509
Quiet, everybody! Here it comes!

07:49.595 --> 07:51.555
Welcome home, honey!

07:52.556 --> 07:54.141
There's my family!

07:54.224 --> 07:56.226
H-Hey, wait, where's the baby?

07:56.310 --> 07:58.687
Well, he likes his hero dad,

07:58.770 --> 08:01.356
but he loves Scooter's Peanut Butter.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.902
Num-num-num-num-num-num-num-num-
num-num-num-num-num-num-num!

08:04.985 --> 08:06.570
<i>Scooter's Peanut Butter.</i>

08:06.653 --> 08:08.447
<i>So good, your baby will want to eat it</i>

08:08.530 --> 08:10.574
<i>in an airport terminal bathroom.</i>

08:11.992 --> 08:14.244
He's a baby who did a baby thing.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.746
Let's all calm down a little.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.165
Wow, I can't believe
Stewie's a commercial star.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.042
We haven't had a
celebrity in the family

08:20.125 --> 08:22.669
since my great-aunt,
Queen of Burlesque Griffin.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.464
<i>Cheesy jokes</i>

08:25.547 --> 08:28.258
<i>And ugly broads</i>

08:28.342 --> 08:30.177
<i>Way back when</i>

08:30.260 --> 08:32.596
<i>They had no porn</i>

08:32.679 --> 08:33.972
<i>Just scarves</i>

08:34.056 --> 08:35.474
<i>Fans</i>

08:35.557 --> 08:36.642
<i>Fat</i>

08:36.725 --> 08:37.976
<i>Gross</i>

08:38.060 --> 08:40.479
<i>A terrible time</i>

08:40.562 --> 08:43.273
<i>For your penis to live in</i>

08:47.694 --> 08:50.405
Bill. Bill. Bill.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.950
Weird magazine about
our town that's just ads.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.202
Hmm, this one's for Stewie.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.788
Whoa, a check for $2,000?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.623
Let me see that.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.417
It's a royalty check
from Stewie's commercial.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.670
Apparently, he gets paid
every time it airs.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.421
This is great.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.590
We can put it right into
Stewie's college fund.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.551
Yeah, yeah,
but, you know,

09:10.634 --> 09:12.636
maybe we should keep
a little bit out to celebrate.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.388
I mean, I ain't
done nothin' fancy

09:14.471 --> 09:16.390
since I bought
those rich guy socks.

09:16.473 --> 09:17.975
Ah, there.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.270
I'm ready to get caught
cheating with my secretary.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.026
Welcome, folks.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.028
Would you like flat
or sparkling water to start?

09:30.112 --> 09:31.405
Garden hose
will be fine.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.574
We prefer it to be hot
and then metal-y.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.117
Actually, Peter,

09:35.200 --> 09:37.035
let's go for the
sparkling water.

09:37.119 --> 09:38.662
I mean, we are
celebrating

09:38.745 --> 09:41.248
our little commercial
star and his big payday.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.542
Oh, I don't care
about that, ma'am.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.127
You know, this is
a nice dinner and all,

09:45.210 --> 09:46.920
but I thought you guys
were going to save

09:47.004 --> 09:48.922
this commercial money
for Stewie's college fund.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.133
We are saving it, Brian.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.843
This is just
a little celebration.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.012
The rest of it is going
right in the bank.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.680
Yeah, and besides,
it's been a while

09:56.763 --> 09:58.599
since we ate at a place
where if you ask for ketchup,

09:58.682 --> 10:01.476
- they look at you like you're dirt.
- You know, Stewie, actually got a call

10:01.560 --> 10:02.811
for another
commercial tomorrow.

10:02.895 --> 10:04.688
Who knows?

10:04.771 --> 10:06.648
This could be the beginning
of a nice career for him.

10:06.732 --> 10:08.275
You sure about this, Lois?

10:08.358 --> 10:10.068
I mean... I mean,
the world of child acting

10:10.152 --> 10:11.945
can be a pretty bad
environment for a kid.

10:12.029 --> 10:13.947
Maybe we should just
let Stewie's childhood

10:14.031 --> 10:15.490
be about being a child.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.492
Wasn't your kid an actor,
you jagoff?

10:17.576 --> 10:19.161
Didn't your father
hate your guts and die?

10:19.244 --> 10:20.495
Whoa!

10:20.579 --> 10:21.872
Bring a gun to a knife fight.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.373
Look, I-I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

10:23.457 --> 10:24.833
All I'm saying is,

10:24.917 --> 10:26.668
just try to keep Stewie's
best interests in mind.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.212
Relax, Brian.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.796
Stewie's fine.
I mean, look at him.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.673
He's happier than
a sunny-side-up egg.

10:31.757 --> 10:33.675
What a great way
to start the day.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.720
What a pan, what a grill.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.514
Oh, no, I'm at Denny's.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.849
Hey, I'm a drug addict
and it's midnight--

10:40.933 --> 10:42.309
where's my breakfast?!

10:42.392 --> 10:44.102
Help, he's only
gonna eat the toast

10:44.186 --> 10:46.188
and put a cigarette out on me.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.985
Okay, Stewie, you booked
the last commercial

10:52.069 --> 10:54.780
without even trying, so this
one should be a piece of cake.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.536
Oh, I guess there are other
people auditioning, too.

11:00.619 --> 11:03.872
Oh, is your child up for the
cough syrup commercial, too?

11:03.956 --> 11:05.874
You'd have no way
of knowing this,

11:05.958 --> 11:07.876
but the moms tend
to dress up.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.878
Oh, thank you.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.672
And you'd have
no way of knowing

11:11.755 --> 11:13.715
that my son is the
Scooter's Peanut Butter Kid.

11:13.799 --> 11:15.717
That's cute.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.929
My son had a gun waved in
his face in a <i>Dexter</i> episode.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.515
Are you guys talking
about your kids?

11:21.598 --> 11:24.226
My daughter is the
American Apparel slut baby.

11:25.561 --> 11:29.106
My son got crapped on
in the last <i>Jackass</i> movie.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.109
God, everyone here
is so talented.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.570
Hi, everybody, we're
a little crunched for time,

11:34.653 --> 11:36.363
so we're gonna have
to audition people

11:36.446 --> 11:37.781
right here in the hallway.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.116
You, do something
exceptional.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.034
Uh, okay.

11:45.622 --> 11:49.793
Ow! Ow. Oh, my grundle.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.129
It's bruised. It's bruised bad.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.922
Oh, okay, I'm out, I'm out.

11:54.006 --> 11:55.382
Tappin' out.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.718
Well, that was
a disaster.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.720
It was humiliating
is what it was.

11:59.803 --> 12:01.180
That woman just smiled

12:01.263 --> 12:03.182
when Stewie banged
his balls on the floor.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.184
A damn disaster.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.186
Num-num-num-num-num-
num-num-num-num?

12:07.269 --> 12:08.937
Shut up,
that's over!

12:09.021 --> 12:10.189
Did you see those other kids?

12:10.272 --> 12:11.398
They were amazing.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.733
One of them was texting

12:12.816 --> 12:14.776
with the funny-dumb kid
from <i>Modern Family.</i>

12:14.860 --> 12:16.195
I want to text with that kid.

12:16.278 --> 12:17.988
Holy Christmas, there were
a lot of hot moms

12:18.071 --> 12:19.823
in yoga pants in there, though.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.618
Dear me, they're really
disappointed in me, Rupert.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.411
I haven't seen
the fat man this upset

12:24.494 --> 12:26.288
since he went
to the 9/11 museum.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.290
Lois made us do this,

12:28.373 --> 12:31.418
but I wanted to go to the
Central Park merry-go-round.

12:31.502 --> 12:33.921
We had time to do both!

12:38.258 --> 12:40.928
What the hell?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.025
Okay, that's great, that's
great, that's great.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.818
Just one question,
Stewie--

12:56.902 --> 12:59.321
do you get pleasure out of
humiliating your family?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.865
Yeah, is there some kind
of sick joy in it?

13:01.949 --> 13:03.659
Why can't he just
be Pierce Brosnan?

13:03.742 --> 13:05.786
- Pierce Brosnan would've got this.
- In a heartbeat!

13:05.869 --> 13:07.120
It's 3:00 in the morning.

13:07.204 --> 13:08.664
What the hell
are you guys doing?

13:08.747 --> 13:10.791
What does it look like?
We're practicing.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.459
Stewie has another
audition tomorrow,

13:12.543 --> 13:14.336
and we're not gonna be
embarrassed like we were today.

13:14.419 --> 13:16.880
See, this is the kind
of thing I was talking about.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.549
And look at him,
he can barely stand up.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.468
That's why I made this--
I call it "8 Hour Energy."

13:21.552 --> 13:24.012
It's one part 5-Hour Energy,
and the other three hours are

13:24.096 --> 13:25.764
espresso, Scotts
Turf Builder,

13:25.848 --> 13:28.767
and a tiny, tiny super-small
amount of cocaine.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.060
Just a little bit.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.646
I can't stress the
littleness of it enough.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.900
Whoa, mama,
there's a kick like a mule!

13:36.984 --> 13:39.903
<i>Who will buy</i>
<i>this wonderful morning</i>

13:39.987 --> 13:42.239
<i>Such a sky</i>
<i>you never did see</i>

13:42.322 --> 13:44.032
There he is,
there's the magic.

13:44.116 --> 13:45.492
Peter, you're giving
your baby drugs

13:45.576 --> 13:46.827
to improve
his acting career?

13:46.910 --> 13:48.287
Oh, he's fine
with it.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.330
Stewie, if you're fine with it,
bleed from the nose.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.792
I think that's
pretty close.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.305
All right, Stewie, now remember
what we practiced last night.

14:06.388 --> 14:08.307
And here's a trick
to keep that confidence up.

14:08.390 --> 14:09.892
You go in that room

14:09.975 --> 14:12.102
and imagine everyone in it
wants you sexually.

14:12.186 --> 14:15.063
I'm doing it right now,
and I feel powerful.

14:15.147 --> 14:16.690
Okay.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.692
And don't forget--
if you screw this up,

14:18.775 --> 14:21.486
- Mommy's gonna kill all of your toys.
- Okay.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.864
All right, now I'm gonna go
psych out these other kids.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.324
Hey, little guy.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.910
Nervous? Sure you are.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.119
Here's something
that might help you.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.956
Hey, little guy.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.292
- Stewie Griffin?
- Oh, right here.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.752
Peter, he needs a boost.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.504
Give him some of
the acting soup.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.300
I want to say curse words!

14:45.427 --> 14:47.930
Okay, Stewie, you're just
gonna drink this juice,

14:48.013 --> 14:50.724
then say, "Mmm,"
and rub your belly.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.560
Yeah, yeah, you got it.

14:53.644 --> 14:54.978
Yeah! Bye, juice!

14:55.062 --> 14:56.313
That was amazing.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.773
I've got goose bumps.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.316
I want him
sexually.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.985
Well, Mom, Dad,

15:02.069 --> 15:04.112
I think we've got our
new orange juice boy.

15:04.196 --> 15:06.114
Does this guy really
think we're his parents?

15:06.198 --> 15:07.574
Stewie got the part?!

15:07.658 --> 15:08.909
Yes!

15:08.992 --> 15:11.995
That is how
you do it!

15:17.084 --> 15:19.086
- Oh, hey, Brian.
- What's going on?

15:19.169 --> 15:21.338
- Where's the fridge?
- Oh, we got a new one.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.131
Stewie booked that
orange juice commercial,

15:23.215 --> 15:25.592
so we thought we'd make a few
upgrades around the house.

15:25.676 --> 15:28.595
Yeah, I even bought an awesome
voice-activated 3-D printer.

15:28.679 --> 15:30.556
Why the hell do you
need a 3-D printer?

15:30.639 --> 15:32.015
Print coyote.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.814
Hey, what, hey, no, no, no!

15:38.897 --> 15:40.816
Heel, heel, heel!

15:40.899 --> 15:43.068
I can't make him attack you, Brian,
but if I keep printing them,

15:43.151 --> 15:44.820
eventually one will
go after you.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.613
That money is supposed to
be for Stewie's college.

15:46.697 --> 15:49.408
He's an actor, you idiot--
he doesn't need college.

15:49.491 --> 15:52.202
Look, I-I just don't think any
of this is good for Stewie.

15:52.286 --> 15:53.704
It's great for Stewie.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.997
He's becoming a star.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.999
That's right.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.877
Man, this must be what it's like
to be Anne Hathaway's parents.

16:01.295 --> 16:03.005
Oh, that's Anne's car.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.882
Ugh.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.011
Hey, Stewie, can
I talk to you?

16:09.094 --> 16:10.637
What are you doing?

16:10.721 --> 16:12.222
I don't know.

16:12.306 --> 16:15.642
Mom and Dad just, uh, stuck
a book on my head and-and left.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.644
Stewie, look at you,
you're a wreck.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.147
And for what? So Peter and Lois
can spend the money you earned

16:20.230 --> 16:21.440
on crap they
don't even need?

16:21.523 --> 16:23.942
Uh, I'm not supposed
to use my voice

16:24.026 --> 16:25.736
for non-paying
stuff, Brian.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.529
This is insane--
you've got to stop.

16:27.613 --> 16:30.324
Ugh, stop worrying,
I'm fine.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.784
And besides, the fat man
knows what he's doing.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.119
No, he doesn't,
he's an idiot.

16:34.203 --> 16:35.662
Remember? He couldn't
even figure out

16:35.746 --> 16:37.664
how to use a hotel
business center.

16:37.748 --> 16:40.459
So, what business
are you in?

16:40.542 --> 16:42.461
Oh, I'm just here to look
at other people's e-mails

16:42.544 --> 16:45.047
who haven't logged out.
And how's business?

16:45.130 --> 16:48.050
Well, I've left some pretty wild
replies on a bunch of Evites.

16:48.133 --> 16:51.053
Look at this-- I'm
bringing 53 guests.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.556
You're the coolest guy I've ever
met in one of these things.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.188
Oh, hey.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.981
You caught me
pigging out.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.983
I'm dipping this celery
stalk into some lemon water.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.777
But don't freak out.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.779
I'm just gonna smell it and
then throw it in the trash.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.572
Stewie, this has
gotten out of control.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.366
If you're gonna
continue on this path,

17:12.449 --> 17:14.159
you need to know
what your future holds.

17:14.243 --> 17:16.703
Being a child actor
almost never ends well.

17:16.787 --> 17:18.497
You remember that kid
from <i>A Christmas Story</i>

17:18.580 --> 17:19.998
who got his tongue
stuck to that pole?

17:20.082 --> 17:21.291
Yeah, whatever
happened to him?

17:21.375 --> 17:22.793
I'll tell you
what happened to him.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.086
He did porn.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.129
Boner from <i>Growing Pains?</i> Dead.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.131
Screech from
<i>Saved by the Bell?</i> Porn.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.383
Corey Haim? Dead.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.802
Dana Plato? Porn, then dead.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.512
Oh, no, this is horrible.

17:33.595 --> 17:36.098
You see, Stewie, there are
tons of actors like this.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.100
They all started out
just like you,

17:38.183 --> 17:39.309
but eventually
they were destroyed

17:39.393 --> 17:41.103
by their parents'
greed, drugs

17:41.186 --> 17:42.688
or perverted
Hollywood directors.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.147
Oh, like Bryan Singer.

17:44.231 --> 17:46.942
Exactly. The point is
it's a dark path.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.278
My God, I had no idea
it could be so bad.

17:49.361 --> 17:51.071
Brian, I don't want
to act anymore.

17:51.154 --> 17:54.074
Good. Now we just got to make
Peter and Lois understand.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.076
Yes, well, if they want
to make me into a monster

17:56.159 --> 17:59.121
like those people, we'll
give 'em a monster.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.123
Like when Godzilla
attacked Haiti.

18:05.377 --> 18:07.379
Oh, my God.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.184
Peter, did you
get my text?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.436
No, hold on.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.438
No, I don't know
what he's doing here.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.982
Okay, Stewie, when Barbara
hands you that orange juice,

18:27.065 --> 18:28.775
you're gonna drink it
and smile.

18:28.859 --> 18:31.278
And really show us that
energy from your audition.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.280
H-Hold on a second,
he's got a smudge on his face.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.740
Let me just take care
of that for you guys.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.200
Here, drink this.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.534
I threw a little Molly
in there, too,

18:37.618 --> 18:39.077
so we'll go out
clubbing afterwards.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.167
Hey, you want this?

18:45.250 --> 18:46.376
Sure, I'll
drink anything.

18:46.460 --> 18:48.212
All right, action!

18:48.295 --> 18:51.381
As a mom, I want my kids
to start their day right.

18:51.465 --> 18:53.467
And there's no better way
than with a glass

18:53.550 --> 18:56.011
of fresh-squeezed
Sunnydale Orange Juice.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.262
Isn't that right,
sweetie?

18:57.346 --> 18:59.306
Shut your hole, bitch!

18:59.389 --> 19:01.308
I'll tell you what I want
fresh-squeezed-- these.

19:02.684 --> 19:03.977
What the hell's
he doing?

19:04.061 --> 19:05.395
He's blowing this.

19:05.479 --> 19:08.982
Oh, here's what I think
of this orange juice.

19:12.069 --> 19:14.988
I-I can't... I can't go right
now with everybody watching.

19:15.072 --> 19:18.617
But-but I presume you understand
the disrespect I intended.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.619
Oh, my God, he's
having a meltdown.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.120
You don't suppose this
has anything to do

19:22.204 --> 19:24.122
with the sleep deprivation
and narcotics?

19:24.206 --> 19:26.917
Oh, Peter, what have
we been thinking?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.920
It's us-- we're the ones
who turned him into this.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.339
Get this kid out of here!
He's fired.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.591
Well done.

19:34.675 --> 19:36.051
Not a bad performance.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.386
Thank you, Brian, I...

19:37.469 --> 19:39.388
Uh, there's the poop. Right now.

19:39.471 --> 19:40.848
Oh, Stewie.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.850
Mommy and Daddy are so sorry.

19:42.933 --> 19:45.644
I-I guess we just got
too caught up in your success

19:45.727 --> 19:47.646
and forgot that you're
just a baby.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.231
You were
right, Brian.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.441
I guess we pushed Stewie
a little too hard.

19:51.525 --> 19:53.443
Well, the good news is
that now he can go back

19:53.527 --> 19:55.487
to being a regular kid.

19:57.531 --> 19:59.449
Why are you winking at
our baby, you creep?

19:59.533 --> 20:01.243
God, that's weird.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.370
I don't want to ever
see that happen again.

20:07.291 --> 20:10.419
Well, we went a little crazy
there, didn't we, Peter?

20:10.502 --> 20:11.670
But I'm glad we have

20:11.753 --> 20:14.423
our normal, very average,
non-famous baby back.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.216
You know, I was once
a very famous baby.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.968
Were you, Peter?

20:18.051 --> 20:20.262
No, but you see how easy
it is for me to lie to you?

20:20.345 --> 20:21.889
I do it every day.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.391
Anyway, looks like everything
worked out for the best.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.393
You know, Brian, that acting
stuff was a bit much for me,

20:26.476 --> 20:28.896
but I did quite enjoy
the dancing and the cocaine.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.689
- Yeah?
- Yep.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.482
So you're just gonna be a
dancer and a drug addict?

20:32.566 --> 20:35.068
For a while. I might
crash when I'm 18,

20:35.152 --> 20:37.279
but then I'll just turn
to the Lord and working out.

20:37.362 --> 20:41.992
I'll-I'll just be a 180-degree
different type of insufferable.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.994
I used to need drugs
to feel powerful,

20:44.077 --> 20:46.288
but now my power comes
from my core strength.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.332
And let's look at that
word, "strength."

20:48.415 --> 20:50.334
The "S" stands
for sacrifice.

20:50.417 --> 20:52.085
No gain without
sacrifice.

20:52.169 --> 20:54.671
The "T," of course, stands for
the sufferings of the cross.

20:54.755 --> 20:56.381
The "R"...
You want some cocaine?

20:56.465 --> 20:59.134
Oh, my God, please, yes!
That's all I want all the time!
