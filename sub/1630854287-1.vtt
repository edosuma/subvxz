WEBVTT

04:12.119 --> 04:14.053
Oh!

04:27.673 --> 04:29.343
Rascal.

04:32.942 --> 04:34.645
Is that you?

04:58.803 --> 05:01.342
You come on out now.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.843
You hear me?

05:13.488 --> 05:15.455
Rascal?

05:21.122 --> 05:22.957
Where are you?

05:24.466 --> 05:26.367
You son of a bitch.

05:28.503 --> 05:30.404
Show yourself!

05:40.614 --> 05:41.712
Rascal.

06:05.903 --> 06:10.543
God damn it...Rascal.

06:21.149 --> 06:24.150
You think you can hide
from me, huh?

06:24.185 --> 06:28.561
You're, uh...disloyal.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.431
Goddamn.

06:47.747 --> 06:50.077
Rascal!

07:01.629 --> 07:06.060
We promised to look after
one another.

07:06.095 --> 07:10.999
We promised we'd be there
for one another.

07:16.138 --> 07:18.578
I take care of you, don't I?

07:22.551 --> 07:25.112
This is the thanks I get?
Huh?

07:28.656 --> 07:30.788
This is how you repay me?

07:30.823 --> 07:33.956
By leaving again?

07:42.934 --> 07:44.868
Okay.

07:44.903 --> 07:46.199
All right, then.

07:46.234 --> 07:47.772
That's how you want to play?

07:47.807 --> 07:49.774
Well, that's just how
we're gonna play it.

07:49.809 --> 07:53.844
But you ain't gonna like it.

07:53.879 --> 07:56.077
Rascal, you ain't gonna like it
one bit.

07:58.785 --> 08:01.852
'Cause there's a penalty
for leaving.

08:02.756 --> 08:04.283
There's a penalty, all right,

08:04.318 --> 08:07.253
and the penalty for that,
my friend, is death.

08:18.739 --> 08:21.036
You hear me?

08:21.071 --> 08:23.269
You flea-bitten son of a bitch.

08:23.304 --> 08:25.073
Death.

08:25.108 --> 08:28.648
By me throwing you in that fire
right over there

08:28.683 --> 08:31.585
till you're black as charcoal,
yeah.

08:31.620 --> 08:35.787
And then I'm gonna eat
your picking bones clean.

08:35.822 --> 08:39.021
And then I'm gonna wash you down
with some hooch.

08:47.636 --> 08:51.737
And then it'll be<i> me</i> doing
the pissing all over<i> your</i> ass.

08:51.772 --> 08:53.035
Yeah!

08:54.170 --> 08:56.071
-Whoo!

08:58.207 --> 09:01.582
On the other hand,
maybe I'll just stuff you.

09:02.178 --> 09:04.915
Stick your head right up
on that wall there, yeah.

09:04.950 --> 09:06.686
Yeah.
Oh, is that what you want?

09:06.721 --> 09:08.622
'Cause that's what you're gonna
get, you keep running off

09:08.657 --> 09:10.184
and leaving me this way.

09:13.728 --> 09:16.157
Nobody leaves me.

09:16.863 --> 09:19.226
God damn it.
Nobody leaves me!

09:26.400 --> 09:30.875
What about you, ginger snitch?

09:36.245 --> 09:38.212
You want some company up there?

10:23.963 --> 10:25.864
I'm sorry, sir.

10:25.899 --> 10:27.096
I didn't -- I didn't mean...

10:27.131 --> 10:28.328
You ain't Rascal.

10:28.363 --> 10:29.967
What?

10:40.144 --> 10:44.212
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bother you.

10:45.017 --> 10:48.117
-Who the hell are you?
-What?

10:48.152 --> 10:50.724
I said, "Who the hell are you?!"
God damn it!

10:50.759 --> 10:52.286
I'm -- I'm nobody.

10:52.321 --> 10:53.958
Nobody?!

10:53.993 --> 10:56.026
I mean, you're standing there,
ain't you?

10:56.061 --> 10:58.259
-Oh.
-You got to be somebody.

10:58.294 --> 11:00.492
I meant
I'm no one that you know.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.902
Well...no shit.

11:04.905 --> 11:07.004
-Where is he?
-Who?

11:07.039 --> 11:09.468
-Rascal, God damn it.
-Who's Rascal?

11:09.503 --> 11:12.504
Rascal. Goddamn disloyal dog
who run off.

11:12.539 --> 11:15.782
-You seen him?
-Sorry, sir. I'm sorry. A dog?!

11:15.817 --> 11:18.510
A dog! Ruff!

11:18.545 --> 11:19.786
-No, sir.
-You sure?

11:19.821 --> 11:21.348
-No, sir.
-What?

11:21.383 --> 11:22.987
-I-I mean -- You mean...
-Hey!

11:23.022 --> 11:26.287
Shut up!
I'll put a hole in you size

11:26.322 --> 11:28.960
of a buffalo's asshole.
You hear me?

11:29.556 --> 11:32.128
Why are you here?
What is your name?

11:32.163 --> 11:34.361
What the hell you rapping
on my door for?

11:34.396 --> 11:37.199
Oh.
My name is Joe, sir.

11:37.234 --> 11:39.773
I got lost in the woods.

11:39.808 --> 11:43.876
I saw smoke coming
from the chimney.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.373
I came here for help.

11:46.408 --> 11:48.914
You sure don't look like
no hiker.

11:48.949 --> 11:50.949
I'm not.

11:50.984 --> 11:54.216
Uh...I got lost.

11:54.251 --> 11:58.055
Let me ask you a question, Joe.

12:00.862 --> 12:02.521
My wife.

12:03.832 --> 12:06.030
She didn't send you out here,
did she?

12:07.429 --> 12:09.968
Oh. I'm sorry, sir.

12:10.003 --> 12:11.904
Your -- Your wife?

12:11.939 --> 12:14.940
- You heard me,
you son of a bitch.

12:14.975 --> 12:17.074
My wife.
Did she send you out here?

12:17.109 --> 12:20.077
She send you out here
to check on me?

12:20.112 --> 12:21.309
No.

12:21.344 --> 12:24.048
She didn't send you out here
to...

12:24.952 --> 12:27.051
...take me away, did she?

12:27.086 --> 12:28.481
Absolutely not.

12:28.516 --> 12:30.120
Don't you lie to me.

12:30.155 --> 12:31.957
I'm not.

12:44.873 --> 12:47.071
All right, then.

12:47.876 --> 12:50.206
I suppose
I'm gonna believe you.

12:54.916 --> 12:56.410
Thank you.

12:56.445 --> 12:58.214
For now.

13:02.187 --> 13:04.484
But you can bet
your sweet little baby nuts

13:04.519 --> 13:09.060
I'm gonna give you some smoke,
I find you've been lying to me.

13:10.096 --> 13:12.525
That clear?

13:12.560 --> 13:14.868
Yeah, that's -- that's clear.

13:22.306 --> 13:23.569
Okay, then.

13:25.408 --> 13:27.078
Come on in.

13:30.919 --> 13:32.281
Thank you.

13:33.251 --> 13:35.119
Have a seat right over there.

13:56.604 --> 13:58.373
Up!

13:59.948 --> 14:01.541
Ah.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.123
Comfy?

14:12.158 --> 14:14.928
Yes, sir. Very much so.
Thank you.

14:14.963 --> 14:16.160
You don't look comfy.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.533
You know, for a second there,

14:26.568 --> 14:29.008
I actually thought
you were gonna shoot me.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.506
I was.

14:36.347 --> 14:40.052
This is a wonderful home
you have here, sir.

14:40.087 --> 14:43.352
I really love everything
you've done with all the, uh...

14:45.554 --> 14:46.553
...dead animals.

14:46.588 --> 14:47.994
Shut up.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.360
We ain't done yet.

14:53.364 --> 14:54.528
We ain't?

14:54.563 --> 14:56.563
Nope.

14:57.269 --> 15:00.666
You still got
some questions to answer.

15:00.701 --> 15:02.635
I-I do?

15:02.670 --> 15:05.671
Goddamn right you do.

15:05.706 --> 15:08.641
This ain't no Holiday Inn, son.

15:08.676 --> 15:11.182
This look like a Holiday Inn
to you?

15:14.319 --> 15:16.088
No, sir, not really.

15:16.123 --> 15:18.992
This is my home.

15:19.027 --> 15:20.587
And you're just a stranger
in it.

15:20.622 --> 15:23.161
Yeah, you're goddamn right.

15:23.196 --> 15:25.229
You got some questions
to answer.

15:26.628 --> 15:28.760
Okay.

15:28.795 --> 15:33.171
- We don't get
many visitors. Yeah.

15:34.702 --> 15:37.637
By "we," I mean me.

15:38.475 --> 15:40.211
And the Rascal.

15:40.246 --> 15:45.480
Normally just the two of us,
except when he runs off.

15:46.483 --> 15:49.385
Which he does.

15:49.420 --> 15:51.222
From time to time.

15:52.093 --> 15:54.192
And when that happens...

15:56.427 --> 15:57.998
...it's just me.

16:00.464 --> 16:03.597
When I'm here all by my lonesome
and some stranger

16:03.632 --> 16:06.039
comes knocking on my door,
well

16:06.074 --> 16:09.108
yeah, I get a little...paranoid.

16:09.143 --> 16:14.773
And so I take some extra
precaution just to be safe.

16:16.117 --> 16:18.777
You can understand that,
now, can't you?

16:18.812 --> 16:20.581
Yes, sir, I understand.

16:20.616 --> 16:23.320
Hm. That's good.
I'm glad you can understand it,

16:23.355 --> 16:26.620
'cause here's
what's gonna happen.

16:26.655 --> 16:29.623
You're just gonna sit there,
keep your goddamn mouth shut,

16:29.658 --> 16:35.398
and only open it if, and
when, I ask you a question.

16:35.433 --> 16:37.763
Okay.
I'm gonna sit right here and --

16:37.798 --> 16:39.468
What did I just say?!

16:39.503 --> 16:41.371
Are you deaf?

16:41.406 --> 16:43.538
Am I not talking clear enough?

16:45.476 --> 16:48.147
You're skating on thin ice
with me, boy. Thin ice.

16:49.678 --> 16:52.547
What's mine is mine,
and I don't know you.

16:53.484 --> 16:56.188
So you just do like I say, hmm?

16:57.785 --> 17:01.094
Or you could end up
just like...her.

17:03.725 --> 17:05.230
Good.

17:06.530 --> 17:08.629
We'll start again.

17:14.637 --> 17:16.208
You got lost?

17:17.739 --> 17:19.541
-Yes, sir.
-Ah.

17:19.576 --> 17:21.411
You didn't come out here
with no one else?

17:21.446 --> 17:23.842
No, sir.

17:23.877 --> 17:26.383
Well, that wasn't very smart
of you, was it?

17:26.418 --> 17:30.288
Well, in hindsight, sir,
no, I guess it wasn't.

17:31.192 --> 17:33.852
What you doing out here
all by yourself?

17:34.921 --> 17:36.459
It's kind of a long story.

17:36.494 --> 17:38.428
I'm not sure you'd believe me.

17:51.212 --> 17:52.442
Okay.

17:56.646 --> 17:58.745
Mm.

18:04.555 --> 18:07.490
Well, I guess I'd be a bit
of a hypocrite...

18:09.329 --> 18:11.758
...if I started throwing stones
'cause somebody

18:11.793 --> 18:13.793
got themselves turned around.

18:13.828 --> 18:17.500
That can happen
to the best of them,

18:17.535 --> 18:21.471
especially out here
in these woods, and...

18:21.506 --> 18:22.835
Yeah.

18:25.675 --> 18:27.807
I can understand that.

18:30.614 --> 18:32.152
Yeah.

18:33.749 --> 18:35.749
It's nice when you're lost

18:35.784 --> 18:39.522
and somebody can help you
find your way.

18:39.557 --> 18:41.260
Am I right?

18:42.560 --> 18:44.560
Yes, sir.

18:48.269 --> 18:51.270
Sheesh. Hm.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.671
Did I say you could get up?!

18:58.543 --> 19:00.444
I'm sorry, sir.

19:01.612 --> 19:05.218
- Don't you worry about
keeping eyes on me, boy.

19:05.253 --> 19:08.650
Oh, look, I can
appreciate your concern.

19:08.685 --> 19:13.589
Yeah, I see you. Just, you're --
you're sitting there,

19:13.624 --> 19:17.395
your hands on your knees...

19:18.299 --> 19:21.498
...thinking, "Well
why is this fella

19:21.533 --> 19:26.404
so -- so -- so paranoid
and suspicious?

19:31.378 --> 19:37.481
Why is this fella so --
so paranoid and suspicious?

19:37.516 --> 19:41.617
when all I want is to find
my way back?"

19:41.652 --> 19:44.851
That right?
Would that be fair?

19:44.886 --> 19:46.457
Maybe.

19:46.492 --> 19:48.723
I-I mean, I guess so.

19:48.758 --> 19:51.264
See, this cabinet was built
way off the beaten path

19:51.299 --> 19:57.666
so that whoever occupies it,
which at the moment

19:57.701 --> 20:03.034
is me and Rascal,
we wouldn't be bothered.

20:03.069 --> 20:07.346
In fact, it's so far
off the path that, well...

20:07.942 --> 20:11.746
...we ain't had a visitor
in a long time.

20:11.781 --> 20:16.454
So when we do have a visitor,

20:16.489 --> 20:17.752
rare as that is, well...

20:17.787 --> 20:20.722
naturally we're curious.

20:20.757 --> 20:22.592
How'd they find it
in the first place?

20:22.627 --> 20:25.595
So question number one is...

20:26.466 --> 20:28.829
...how did you find it
in the first place?

20:32.604 --> 20:34.569
I don't know.

20:38.643 --> 20:41.974
What the hell do you mean,
you don't know?

20:42.009 --> 20:45.615
I-I mean, really, I don't know.

20:45.650 --> 20:48.079
I went off the trail I was on

20:48.114 --> 20:50.081
and got turned around.

20:50.116 --> 20:53.491
I honestly couldn't tell you.

20:53.526 --> 20:56.362
Then I saw the smoke.

20:56.397 --> 20:58.023
I mean, thank God
you had your fire going.

20:58.058 --> 21:00.960
I wouldn't thank him just yet.

21:01.897 --> 21:04.469
I ain't too convinced
that what you're saying

21:04.504 --> 21:06.669
ain't a heaping pile of shit.

21:07.573 --> 21:09.474
Well, I'm telling you,
it's the --

21:09.509 --> 21:11.102
Question number two --

21:11.137 --> 21:15.513
How do I know you're not
some goddamn psycho killer?

21:17.451 --> 21:18.516
What?

21:20.487 --> 21:23.686
Psycho killer, God damn it.

21:24.425 --> 21:29.791
How do I know you're not some
maniac madman on the loose?

21:29.826 --> 21:32.090
Well, I...

21:32.125 --> 21:35.401
I mean, do I look like
a psycho killer to you?

21:35.436 --> 21:37.634
Well, yes, you do.

21:37.669 --> 21:41.704
I read all about them sick
bastards in the papers, and...

21:42.443 --> 21:47.039
...all of them's librarians
or schoolteachers or lawyers.

21:47.074 --> 21:52.143
Ordinary-looking people
just -- just like you.

21:52.178 --> 21:57.753
Harmless on the outside,
but, inside crazy.

21:57.788 --> 21:59.986
Cannibalistical.

22:00.021 --> 22:01.790
Mm-hmm.

22:01.825 --> 22:03.825
Child molesters.

22:03.860 --> 22:05.893
Evil sons of bitches.

22:06.896 --> 22:11.767
I'm not a teacher
or a librarian. I swear.

22:11.802 --> 22:15.870
I don't give a rat's ass
what you swear

22:15.905 --> 22:19.104
you are or you aren't.

22:19.139 --> 22:20.974
I just want to make damn sure

22:21.009 --> 22:24.483
that you're not gonna come
creeping up behind me

22:24.518 --> 22:29.983
with a frying pan and bash
my brains in and cook me

22:30.018 --> 22:32.755
and eat me for your supper.

22:32.790 --> 22:36.154
I'm not gonna kill you
or eat you. I promise.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.628
-You promise?
-- I promise.

22:37.663 --> 22:40.664
-You swear?
-I swear.

22:42.899 --> 22:44.932
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

22:44.967 --> 22:47.198
Because I don't eat people.

22:47.233 --> 22:48.903
You don't?

22:48.938 --> 22:50.575
No.

22:50.610 --> 22:52.170
You just kill them?

22:52.205 --> 22:54.139
Of course not.

22:54.174 --> 22:56.174
It's against the law.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.714
That's right.

22:57.749 --> 23:00.585
It's against the law.

23:01.247 --> 23:03.456
Besides...

23:03.491 --> 23:05.755
eating people is gross.

23:06.857 --> 23:08.923
Yes, sir.

23:08.958 --> 23:11.827
A man's only as good
as his word. Mm-hmm.

23:11.862 --> 23:13.961
You break that, you break the
very thing you claim to be --

23:13.996 --> 23:17.767
a man.
So you remember that.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.034
Yes, sir.

23:21.069 --> 23:23.201
Question number three.

23:30.276 --> 23:32.617
And this one may be
more important

23:32.652 --> 23:36.016
-than the other two, so...

23:36.051 --> 23:40.823
...well, don't you
go getting cute with me.

23:40.858 --> 23:42.187
Mm.

23:45.863 --> 23:47.962
Joe...

23:49.031 --> 23:50.932
...are you a salesman?

23:52.034 --> 23:53.902
No.

23:53.937 --> 23:55.002
Joe.

23:55.037 --> 23:56.674
-I'm not.
-Joe.

23:56.709 --> 23:58.203
I'm not.

24:02.011 --> 24:04.847
Don't you lie to me now.

24:04.882 --> 24:07.113
Well, I'm not.
I swear I'm not.

24:07.148 --> 24:09.489
I'm not selling anything.

24:13.055 --> 24:15.990
What you got in your bag?

24:16.025 --> 24:17.497
Hey!

24:20.029 --> 24:22.029
Nice and slow.

24:26.134 --> 24:27.606
Okay.

24:37.882 --> 24:39.717
It's just some toiletries and...

24:41.622 --> 24:42.918
...and a first-aid kit.

24:42.953 --> 24:46.218
And some trail mix and...

24:46.253 --> 24:49.221
Look, I'm not a salesman.

24:49.256 --> 24:51.256
Give me the bag.

25:04.337 --> 25:07.008
Nothing else, huh?

25:14.787 --> 25:16.820
What's this for?

25:18.659 --> 25:20.186
Whittling a flute?

25:20.221 --> 25:23.563
Um, no, sir.

25:25.193 --> 25:26.797
Well, what then?

25:26.832 --> 25:28.293
It's for protection.

25:28.328 --> 25:30.295
-Protection?
-Yes, sir.

25:30.330 --> 25:33.606
-Against who?
-Well, hopefully no one.

25:35.071 --> 25:36.807
Well...

25:36.842 --> 25:38.743
why is it in your bag?

25:38.778 --> 25:42.813
Well, because I knew
I was coming out to these woods.

25:44.652 --> 25:47.048
You've been out here before?

25:47.787 --> 25:49.215
Yes, sir.

25:50.790 --> 25:53.758
I used to come here
when I was little.

25:53.793 --> 25:55.859
Whenever I'd visit
my grandfather,

25:55.894 --> 25:58.994
he used to take me out here
to fly-fish the Little River.

25:59.029 --> 26:00.259
Huh?

26:01.295 --> 26:04.802
This ain't
for no fly-fishing, Joe.

26:04.837 --> 26:06.903
Well, I mean, he told me

26:06.938 --> 26:09.367
you can never be too careful
in these woods.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.776
That you should be ready
for anything.

26:11.811 --> 26:16.275
He -- He told me it's beautiful,
but it can also be dangerous.

26:16.310 --> 26:18.277
Well...

26:19.082 --> 26:21.379
...he was right about that.

26:25.055 --> 26:28.628
There's all kind of death
and beauty out here.

26:38.937 --> 26:40.673
Oh, may I have it back, please?

26:40.708 --> 26:43.071
Well...

26:43.106 --> 26:45.205
if it's all the same to you,
Joe,

26:45.240 --> 26:50.012
I think that I'll hold on
to it for the time being.

26:53.985 --> 26:56.821
You ain't out of the woods.

26:58.154 --> 26:59.285
Yet.

27:02.224 --> 27:05.423
Right. Right.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.260
I understand.

27:19.241 --> 27:20.339
Well...

27:20.374 --> 27:21.846
where you off to?

27:22.475 --> 27:24.310
And where's the fire?

27:25.984 --> 27:29.150
Um...you can keep the knife.

27:29.185 --> 27:32.021
I-I just feel like
maybe I'd be better off

27:32.056 --> 27:33.792
if I was on my way, is all.

27:33.827 --> 27:36.223
Well, on your way?
Where?

27:36.258 --> 27:38.896
- Oh. Uh...

27:38.931 --> 27:40.491
Well, um...

27:40.526 --> 27:42.768
uh, I was thinking...

27:42.803 --> 27:43.868
No, you weren't.

27:43.903 --> 27:45.903
-What?
-- Thinking.

27:45.938 --> 27:48.433
You weren't thinking at all,
were you?

27:49.271 --> 27:52.338
Actually, no,
I guess I wasn't.

27:55.277 --> 27:57.948
Why did you just try to run off?

28:00.315 --> 28:02.150
You scare me.

28:03.351 --> 28:05.087
I scare you?

28:05.122 --> 28:07.353
Yes, sir.

28:07.388 --> 28:10.862
Well, why is that?

28:10.897 --> 28:13.392
I mean, you seem a little crazy,
is all.

28:13.427 --> 28:14.965
Crazy?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.362
Crazy how?

28:16.397 --> 28:18.430
Oh, I don't know.

28:18.465 --> 28:22.005
Just in a general kind of a way.

28:23.569 --> 28:25.140
Well...

28:29.344 --> 28:32.411
I learned a long time ago --

28:32.446 --> 28:35.447
Never give nobody the benefit
of the doubt. Mm-hmm.

28:35.482 --> 28:38.054
Hm.
Why don't we do this?

28:38.089 --> 28:43.323
Why don't we just --
just nip it in the bud, hmm?

28:43.358 --> 28:46.865
Cut right to the chase,
and let's just agree

28:46.900 --> 28:50.528
that we are not going to hurt
each other, huh?

28:50.563 --> 28:53.905
How does that sound?
Like a plan?

28:55.535 --> 28:57.469
Will you give me your word
on that, sir?

28:57.504 --> 29:00.505
<i>My</i> word?
Well, what about<i> your</i> word?

29:00.540 --> 29:03.475
I'm the one who's offer
the olive branch here,

29:03.510 --> 29:05.510
Mr. Dipshit, huh?

29:05.545 --> 29:09.151
Hey, why would
I ever want to hurt you?

29:09.186 --> 29:11.153
I mean, that would be cruel.

29:11.188 --> 29:13.419
Look at you shaking.

29:13.454 --> 29:16.092
You look like about
to piss yourself.

29:20.868 --> 29:22.296
That's because I am, sir.

29:22.331 --> 29:24.529
Well, not on my floor,
God damn it.

29:24.564 --> 29:28.973
You got to piss, go on.
You use the pissoir.

29:29.008 --> 29:30.909
Right over there.

29:32.209 --> 29:34.847
Go on. Shoo.
I won't watch, darlin'.

29:42.087 --> 29:44.483
Just follow your nose.

29:57.432 --> 29:59.630
Yeah, you found it.
Good boy.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.368
You got it.

30:17.518 --> 30:20.585
That's the trouble with
all you young people these days.

30:21.929 --> 30:23.324
Especially you younger men.

30:23.359 --> 30:25.392
You got no fight in you,

30:25.427 --> 30:30.232
no taste for violence, yeah.

30:30.267 --> 30:32.564
-Your blood don't boil...

30:32.599 --> 30:35.468
...like those who come before.

30:36.207 --> 30:38.108
Like me, my generation.

30:38.143 --> 30:41.309
We was brought up like
ancient Greek warriors.

30:41.344 --> 30:43.608
I read about them in a book.
Spar-tans.

30:43.643 --> 30:47.018
You know,
if a Spartan baby was born lame

30:47.053 --> 30:50.450
or, you know, retardo,
mongoloid brain or something,

30:50.485 --> 30:53.189
they just tossed that little
bastard right off a cliff, yeah.

30:53.224 --> 30:55.224
'Cause they got
no use for weakness.

30:56.392 --> 30:58.458
That's how we was brought up.

30:58.493 --> 31:00.526
-Hm.
-You wouldn't happen to have

31:00.561 --> 31:02.396
any soap by chance, would you?

31:02.431 --> 31:04.695
Soap?

31:04.730 --> 31:07.203
That's just what
I'm talking about, Joe.

31:08.173 --> 31:11.009
Yeah. Now...

31:11.044 --> 31:13.077
see, uh...

31:15.642 --> 31:17.444
...I don't mean to offend you,
but let's say

31:17.479 --> 31:20.051
that you was born
a Spartan baby.

31:20.086 --> 31:24.517
-And I think, like -- "Aaaahhh!"

31:25.685 --> 31:28.257
You'd have got the cliff.

31:28.292 --> 31:31.062
That's actually very offensive,
if you think about it, sir.

31:31.097 --> 31:33.295
Do you even know where you are?

31:34.364 --> 31:37.068
Well, somewhere in the Smokies.

31:37.103 --> 31:42.106
Well, that somewhere
is about 180,000-plus acres

31:42.141 --> 31:45.439
of rocks and trees

31:45.474 --> 31:47.474
and dark danger, and, son,

31:47.509 --> 31:50.279
you sure don't look like
you're no Daniel Boone.

31:51.546 --> 31:54.349
You said your granddaddy
used to bring you

31:54.384 --> 31:56.120
out here to these woods?

31:56.155 --> 31:58.221
Oh, yes, sir.

31:58.256 --> 32:01.752
Uh-huh. So you are familiar
with the woods,

32:01.787 --> 32:05.558
but you're not too familiar?

32:05.593 --> 32:07.263
Uh, I guess so.

32:07.298 --> 32:12.433
And you got no idea
how you got here?

32:14.041 --> 32:17.009
Uh...no.

32:17.044 --> 32:19.473
Not really. It's...

32:19.508 --> 32:22.542
It's all a little fuzzy.
I-I...

32:25.151 --> 32:26.845
Take a look.

32:30.717 --> 32:32.618
Uh-huh.

32:32.653 --> 32:36.226
Yeah, I know that
when the sun sets about,

32:36.261 --> 32:38.459
say, 20 minutes from now,

32:38.494 --> 32:42.463
a storm front from the south
is gonna roll right in.

32:42.498 --> 32:44.036
It's gonna open up,
and it's gonna rain

32:44.071 --> 32:49.239
all kind of hell
on whatever is under it.

32:49.274 --> 32:52.539
-So...
-So?

32:52.574 --> 32:54.772
So since you don't know
where you are

32:54.807 --> 32:57.643
or how you got here
or where you're going,

32:57.678 --> 32:59.579
if I was you...

33:01.649 --> 33:03.385
...I'd stay put.

33:03.420 --> 33:08.291
Now, you come here
looking for help.

33:08.326 --> 33:11.492
This is the best
you're gonna get.

33:11.527 --> 33:14.099
So it's up to you.

33:17.104 --> 33:19.302
You know these woods?

33:20.635 --> 33:23.636
Nobody knows these woods...

33:24.408 --> 33:25.638
...better than me.

33:27.609 --> 33:31.347
Except maybe Rascal,
and he's, uh, well...

33:31.382 --> 33:33.283
gone.

33:33.318 --> 33:37.320
You stay the night, stay warm,

33:37.355 --> 33:40.092
and you head out first thing
in the morning when it's safe.

33:40.127 --> 33:44.294
And then I'll point you
in the right direction.

33:45.759 --> 33:48.199
I ain't gonna hurt you.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.796
You got my word on that.

33:51.831 --> 33:54.766
-Do I got yours?

33:55.505 --> 33:57.637
Yes, sir.

33:58.409 --> 34:00.409
Well, all right, then.

34:01.874 --> 34:04.413
Are you sure I'm not imposing?

34:04.448 --> 34:05.711
You ain't imposing.

34:05.746 --> 34:09.583
Hell, if I'm being
completely honest...

34:11.587 --> 34:15.325
...I wouldn't mind the company.
Yeah.

34:15.360 --> 34:19.329
I wouldn't mind having somebody
new to talk to for a change.

34:20.233 --> 34:21.859
Well, all right, then.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.861
Well, I'll stay here with you

34:23.896 --> 34:26.501
as long as you're sure
it's no trouble.

34:26.536 --> 34:28.470
None at all.

34:31.871 --> 34:33.409
Thank you.

34:33.444 --> 34:36.775
Well, don't mention it.

34:43.718 --> 34:45.685
-Coffee!

34:45.720 --> 34:48.919
-Excuse me?
-I got coffee.

34:48.954 --> 34:51.262
I could make us a cup.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.791
Would you like that?

34:52.826 --> 34:54.859
Yes, sure.

34:54.894 --> 34:56.927
Well..

34:56.962 --> 34:58.335
all right, then.

35:03.309 --> 35:05.243
Yeah.

35:06.444 --> 35:08.213
-Hey, Joe.

35:08.248 --> 35:10.380
I told you.

35:42.315 --> 35:43.578
Ha!

35:55.691 --> 35:58.725
You just be glad you ain't
no snake-oil drummer.

35:58.760 --> 36:00.364
Phew!

36:02.500 --> 36:04.434
So you really don't like 'em,
do you?

36:04.469 --> 36:06.601
Salesmen? Hell no.
Huh!

36:06.636 --> 36:08.570
Forking tongue.

36:08.605 --> 36:11.441
Slippery little shits.
The lot of 'em.

36:11.476 --> 36:14.510
-You can't trust them.
-Why not?

36:14.545 --> 36:16.908
Well, you can't trust
a salesman ever.

36:16.943 --> 36:19.317
'Cause if you ain't buying
what he's selling,

36:19.352 --> 36:21.946
why, he ain't eating.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

36:21.981 --> 36:25.257
They don't give a damn
about you or what you need.

36:25.292 --> 36:26.885
They're just trying
to make their monthly. Yeah.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.294
Trust me, I know about this,
yeah.

36:29.329 --> 36:32.396
See, I had
the unfortunate experience

36:32.431 --> 36:36.433
of dabbling in sales myself
when I was a younger man.

36:36.468 --> 36:37.764
Oh. Really?

36:37.799 --> 36:39.865
Oh, yes.

36:39.900 --> 36:42.373
Well, what happened?

36:42.408 --> 36:43.770
What do you mean?

36:43.805 --> 36:46.410
Well, I mean, to not make you
like salesmen

36:46.445 --> 36:47.807
or being a salesman.

36:47.842 --> 36:49.776
Well, all I know
is that when I was younger,

36:49.811 --> 36:52.713
I took a job as a salesman

36:52.748 --> 36:55.782
just to try to make
some extra money.

36:55.817 --> 36:59.819
See, back in those days,
it was tough to make ends meet,

36:59.854 --> 37:03.823
and it wasn't uncommon for
fellas to hold down a few jobs.

37:03.858 --> 37:06.331
And, well, in the beginning,
you know,

37:06.366 --> 37:08.399
it wasn't too bad.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.962
And I don't give a 2-cent shit
about what I was selling.

37:10.997 --> 37:14.537
I just wanted the do-re-mi,
huh? Yeah.

37:14.572 --> 37:15.769
But...

37:17.608 --> 37:20.609
...after a while,

37:20.644 --> 37:22.842
it started to grate on me
a little, you know,

37:22.877 --> 37:25.977
and, well, I quit
'cause I just got --

37:26.012 --> 37:28.749
I got sick and tired
of deceiving people. Mm-hmm.

37:28.784 --> 37:31.719
Sick and tired
of deceiving myself,

37:31.754 --> 37:33.787
if you know what I mean.

37:33.822 --> 37:36.526
I just got sick and tired
of feeling like every day

37:36.561 --> 37:38.858
was just a waking nightmare,
going door to door,

37:38.893 --> 37:41.663
selling people shit
that they did not need

37:41.698 --> 37:45.370
and that they could not afford
just so that I could make my nut

37:45.405 --> 37:48.065
and pay the bills
and keep the wife happy

37:48.100 --> 37:50.969
so she wouldn't bust my ass
about not being able to buy

37:51.004 --> 37:53.609
the new goddamn toaster oven.

37:55.547 --> 37:58.009
You don't wanna
really hear this now.

37:58.044 --> 37:59.846
Do you?

37:59.881 --> 38:03.949
-Um, you mentioned your wife.
-Mm.

38:03.984 --> 38:05.390
Are you still married?

38:05.425 --> 38:06.622
Shit.

38:06.657 --> 38:08.426
Do I look like I'm married
to you?

38:08.461 --> 38:10.626
What happened?

38:10.661 --> 38:12.023
Sometimes the fucking you get

38:12.058 --> 38:14.399
ain't worth the fucking
you receive.

38:17.998 --> 38:20.636
That's enough about her, huh?
Yeah.

38:22.442 --> 38:25.872
I could tell you a funny story
about a salesman if...

38:25.907 --> 38:27.104
if you want to hear it.

38:28.008 --> 38:30.910
Um, sure.

38:30.945 --> 38:32.681
Okay.

38:34.113 --> 38:36.080
Once upon a time

38:36.115 --> 38:38.621
"Once upon a time."
One time a long time ago,

38:38.656 --> 38:40.557
a fella come here.
He was a Bible salesman.

38:40.592 --> 38:43.593
Goddamn Bible salesman.
Can you believe that shit?

38:45.025 --> 38:48.092
I mean, what's a fella doing
hawking the Good Book out here

38:48.127 --> 38:50.094
in the middle
of the Smoky Mountains?

38:50.129 --> 38:52.866
I mean, to who?

38:52.901 --> 38:55.165
Well, this fella's name was...

38:55.200 --> 38:58.443
was, um -- His name was...

38:59.875 --> 39:02.106
Mm! Can't ever remember his name
for some reason,

39:02.141 --> 39:05.043
but it don't really matter.

39:05.078 --> 39:09.850
But, yeah, oh, boy, I sure do
remember his stupid, fat face.

39:10.952 --> 39:13.117
I remember his shit-brown tie.

39:13.152 --> 39:16.054
I remember
his leather briefcase.

39:16.089 --> 39:18.023
And I remember I answered
the door,

39:18.058 --> 39:21.433
and he sticks his arms
out wide kind of like this.

39:21.468 --> 39:23.765
And he says...

39:24.636 --> 39:27.098
- Greetings
and salutations, brother!

39:27.133 --> 39:29.903
What a glorious day it is,
indeed.

39:29.938 --> 39:33.511
Tell me something, sir,
and, please,

39:33.546 --> 39:35.843
I implore you
to be honest with me --

39:35.878 --> 39:38.879
"Have you accepted
the Lord Jesus Christ

39:38.914 --> 39:42.586
as your personal savior?
Because if you have not..."

39:42.621 --> 39:45.050
I'd like to invite you
to join me today

39:45.085 --> 39:49.087
-in his warm embrace.
-"In his warm embrace."

39:52.158 --> 39:55.665
That's what he said. That's the
first words out of his mouth.

39:55.700 --> 39:57.029
Then what?

39:57.064 --> 40:00.131
Well, then I gave him
a warm embrace.

40:00.166 --> 40:02.672
Oh.

40:02.707 --> 40:05.609
Something tells me you didn't
buy a Bible, though, did you?

40:05.644 --> 40:08.513
No, I did not, no.

40:08.548 --> 40:10.141
What'd you do to him?

40:10.176 --> 40:14.112
I invited him in,
just much like you, actually.

40:14.147 --> 40:17.984
Oh? You threw a shotgun
in his face?

40:18.019 --> 40:20.019
Oh, hell no.
I didn't have to do that.

40:20.054 --> 40:23.660
No, I offered him some coffee
and some cake.

40:23.695 --> 40:25.629
You have cake?

40:25.664 --> 40:27.697
Joe...

40:27.732 --> 40:31.965
this is where the story
gets real good.

40:33.606 --> 40:36.200
Yeah. Hee hee.

40:36.235 --> 40:38.873
So I invited him in.

40:38.908 --> 40:42.910
I asked him to have a seat.
Right there.

40:42.945 --> 40:46.683
Exactly where you're sitting
as a matter of fact.

40:46.718 --> 40:48.685
I went into the kitchen.

40:50.821 --> 40:53.921
Poured him a cup of coffee.

40:55.188 --> 40:58.563
Brought him out a nice hunk
of carrot cake.

40:58.598 --> 41:01.995
Yeah. See,
that was really for Rascal,

41:02.030 --> 41:04.569
'cause that's his favorite,
but, well...

41:04.604 --> 41:07.099
I gave it
to the fat man instead.

41:07.134 --> 41:08.771
And then...

41:12.304 --> 41:14.172
...I took a seat.
Mm-hmm.

41:16.341 --> 41:18.847
Right across from him.

41:22.985 --> 41:24.182
Ain't it good?

41:24.217 --> 41:27.119
Mmm. Very.

41:29.189 --> 41:31.255
Now...

41:31.290 --> 41:35.325
he was a very pious man,

41:35.360 --> 41:36.964
this fella. Mm-hmm.

41:36.999 --> 41:39.571
Real self-righteous type, too.

41:39.606 --> 41:43.938
You know,
a kind of fella who...

41:43.973 --> 41:47.645
who follows all them rules
they got.

41:47.680 --> 41:52.683
Thou shalt not take
the Lord's name in vain!

41:52.718 --> 41:55.279
Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's wife!

41:55.314 --> 41:58.920
Thou shalt not kill!

41:58.955 --> 42:02.088
Blah! Blah!

42:02.123 --> 42:05.729
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

42:05.764 --> 42:07.192
Yeah.

42:07.227 --> 42:13.000
Anyway, he was
a strong believer in all that.

42:13.035 --> 42:14.804
Yeah.

42:14.839 --> 42:16.938
At least...

42:17.644 --> 42:20.073
...that's how he presented
himself to be.

42:20.108 --> 42:23.813
I mean, he was also
a salesman.

42:23.848 --> 42:25.782
You follow?

42:25.817 --> 42:31.216
So it was hard to tell whether
or not he was being genuine now.

42:35.959 --> 42:39.125
I couldn't tell you why then,
and I cannot tell you why now.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.864
But for some reason,
on that day...

42:44.429 --> 42:49.300
...I-I felt like
I had to find out

42:49.335 --> 42:52.743
whether or not he was
a true believer.

42:52.778 --> 42:57.341
Or was he just
completely full of shit?

42:58.146 --> 43:00.652
How did you do that?

43:00.687 --> 43:02.984
I asked him a few questions.

43:03.019 --> 43:05.019
What'd you ask him?

43:07.287 --> 43:10.156
I started like...

43:11.126 --> 43:13.896
I said, "Sir...

43:13.931 --> 43:16.833
do you really believe
that God loves you?"

43:16.868 --> 43:17.900
And he said...

43:17.935 --> 43:20.364
Brother, I know God loves me.

43:23.204 --> 43:26.337
Okay.
I said, "Well,

43:26.372 --> 43:31.716
if God loves you so much,
how come he got you

43:31.751 --> 43:35.852
selling Bibles out here
in the middle of fucking nowhere

43:35.887 --> 43:38.756
instead of living in a mansion
with a million dollars

43:38.791 --> 43:41.418
and fancy women?"
And he says...

43:41.453 --> 43:46.258
Brother, the Lord has a plan
for all of us.

43:46.293 --> 43:48.964
I'm exactly where
he wants me to be --

43:48.999 --> 43:53.067
spreading his good word
to any and all who will listen

43:53.102 --> 43:54.970
and accept his love.

43:55.005 --> 43:56.906
So I says to him...

43:58.371 --> 44:03.143
..."So, you really believe that,
don't you,

44:03.178 --> 44:06.047
that God put you right here,
right now,

44:06.082 --> 44:09.380
because that's where
he wants you to be?"

44:10.922 --> 44:13.153
Yes, sir, I do.

44:14.860 --> 44:17.256
I said, "Well...

44:18.798 --> 44:21.095
...if that's true,

44:21.130 --> 44:24.428
that must mean that God knows
you'd run into me.

44:24.463 --> 44:27.134
Right? And he nodded.

44:27.169 --> 44:28.938
Yeah.

44:28.973 --> 44:33.008
And that's when I leaned in...

44:33.043 --> 44:34.438
real close.

44:34.473 --> 44:37.914
And I said, "Well...

44:37.949 --> 44:42.149
what if you come to find out
that I'm very...

44:43.416 --> 44:45.790
...very dangerous?

44:46.991 --> 44:50.289
If you come to find that out...

44:51.094 --> 44:56.999
...well, it must mean
that God hates you.

44:57.034 --> 44:59.166
Doesn't he?

44:59.201 --> 45:03.137
Because he put you in my path.

45:03.172 --> 45:04.809
Didn't he?"

45:08.848 --> 45:11.849
Oh, boy, I tell you.

45:11.884 --> 45:13.411
Whoooo!

45:13.446 --> 45:15.215
He went white.

45:17.219 --> 45:18.515
Are you?

45:18.550 --> 45:19.824
Am I what?

45:19.859 --> 45:21.991
Dangerous?

45:22.026 --> 45:24.026
What do<i> you</i> think?

45:24.061 --> 45:25.797
I think you hurt him.

45:25.832 --> 45:27.997
Hell no, I didn't hurt him.

45:30.331 --> 45:31.330
You didn't?

45:31.365 --> 45:32.496
No, I'm...

45:34.104 --> 45:35.873
I scared a little.

45:36.502 --> 45:37.941
Why?

45:37.976 --> 45:40.570
I had to get my answer,
didn't I?

45:40.605 --> 45:42.374
What answer?

45:42.409 --> 45:47.984
Of whether he was
a true believer or not.

45:48.019 --> 45:49.887
Was he?

45:49.922 --> 45:52.252
If he wasn't...

45:53.288 --> 45:57.125
...I certainly put the fear
of God into him that day.

46:02.902 --> 46:04.269
Yeah.

46:08.138 --> 46:09.170
What'd you do to him?

46:09.205 --> 46:11.271
Oh.

46:12.340 --> 46:15.913
You don't really want
to hear that, do you?

46:15.948 --> 46:17.882
Tell me.

46:20.414 --> 46:22.084
Well...

46:25.419 --> 46:27.188
-Well...

46:27.223 --> 46:29.960
When I was in the kitchen

46:29.995 --> 46:33.227
getting him something to eat
and drink, I, uh...

46:33.262 --> 46:38.298
well, I slipped a little
something-something

46:38.333 --> 46:42.467
into his coffee
that made him kind of sleepy.

46:42.502 --> 46:44.601
-You poisoned him!
-Now, don't get riled up, Joe.

46:44.636 --> 46:49.210
I didn't poison him. That sounds
kind of sinister.

46:49.245 --> 46:51.509
No. I drugged him.

46:51.544 --> 46:53.577
-You drugged him?
-Yes, I did.

46:53.612 --> 46:56.547
-With what?
-Uh...

46:56.582 --> 47:01.288
Well, I don't actually remember,
but it must be here somewhere.

47:01.323 --> 47:03.554
What's the difference
between poisoning and drugging?

47:03.589 --> 47:06.260
I don't know. One is sinister,
and the other ain't.

47:06.295 --> 47:07.965
-All right?!
-All right.

47:08.000 --> 47:09.098
So -- So you drugged him.

47:09.133 --> 47:11.166
Well, just a little bit.

47:11.201 --> 47:14.906
I mean, I had to make certain
that he was not a psycho killer.

47:14.941 --> 47:18.041
You know the drill.
You know that I get suspicious.

47:18.076 --> 47:21.044
I told you that already.

47:23.279 --> 47:24.916
Then what?

47:24.951 --> 47:28.986
Well, I ain't too proud
of what I did after that.

47:30.715 --> 47:32.319
What did you do?

47:32.354 --> 47:35.124
Well...

47:37.590 --> 47:42.593
Well, you know, after
he...nodded off, I

47:45.268 --> 47:48.434
Well, hell, Joe,
I tied him to the stove.

47:50.240 --> 47:53.010
You tied him on the stove?!

47:53.045 --> 47:55.672
On the -- No, that would be
cruel and crazy.

47:55.707 --> 47:58.114
No, I tied him<i> to</i> the stove.

47:59.612 --> 48:01.249
Well, was it hot?

48:01.284 --> 48:02.679
Of course it was hot.

48:02.714 --> 48:05.385
You tied him to the front
of a burning stove?

48:05.420 --> 48:08.718
Mm. And then I took
that shit-brown necktie

48:08.753 --> 48:10.258
he was wearing, and I tied that

48:10.293 --> 48:13.965
around his eyes
like a blindfold.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.595
That's the part
I'm not too proud of.

48:17.630 --> 48:19.663
That's the part you're
not too proud of?

48:19.698 --> 48:21.104
Yeah.

48:21.139 --> 48:23.634
Using his tie as a blindfold?

48:23.669 --> 48:27.242
Well, what about drugging him
or tying him to a burning stove?

48:27.277 --> 48:30.047
Oh, please.
It wasn't that bad.

48:30.082 --> 48:32.984
It was just
for a couple of hours.

48:33.019 --> 48:36.152
-- A few hours?
-Yep.

48:36.187 --> 48:37.549
Why?

48:37.584 --> 48:39.683
I didn't trust him.

48:39.718 --> 48:41.487
I wanted to ask him
some questions,

48:41.522 --> 48:43.588
and I wanted him to be honest.

48:43.623 --> 48:46.756
And when you're scared,
you're honest. So I scared him.

48:46.791 --> 48:49.099
- Aah!

48:49.134 --> 48:53.235
- And, uh,
after that, he got...

48:54.766 --> 48:56.436
-What?
-Well...

48:58.506 --> 49:02.046
Well, actually, he got
kind of entertaining.

49:02.081 --> 49:04.048
-What do you mean?

49:04.083 --> 49:06.644
Well, he, um...

49:06.679 --> 49:08.679
I don't know.

49:08.714 --> 49:11.055
Maybe it was being
so close to that heat

49:11.090 --> 49:14.421
for quite a while, I guess,
and...

49:14.456 --> 49:16.258
But, anyway, when he come to,

49:16.293 --> 49:19.030
he just -- ka-boom -- started
hallucinating or something.

49:19.065 --> 49:21.362
He started talking
in all kind of gibberish.

49:21.397 --> 49:24.464
Like

49:28.503 --> 49:30.239
Like he's talking in tongues
or something like that.

49:30.274 --> 49:33.704
But then he proceeded
to start praying

49:33.739 --> 49:36.575
and talking to the Virgin Mary.

49:36.610 --> 49:39.281
Talking to the mother of God.

49:39.316 --> 49:41.712
-You know? Ooh!
-What did he say?

49:41.747 --> 49:45.518
He just kept repeating the same
thing over and over again --

49:45.553 --> 49:49.357
"Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

49:49.392 --> 49:53.592
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners."

49:53.627 --> 49:57.794
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners.

49:57.829 --> 50:01.699
"Holy Mary, mother
of God, pray for us sinners,

50:01.734 --> 50:03.833
now and at the hour
of our death.

50:03.868 --> 50:06.638
Now and
at the hour of our death."

50:08.147 --> 50:09.212
"Pray for us sinners!

50:09.247 --> 50:10.576
Pray for us! And pray for us!"

50:10.611 --> 50:11.808
On and on and on.

50:11.843 --> 50:13.744
Finally it stopped.

50:13.779 --> 50:17.418
It was quiet.
His head droops.

50:17.453 --> 50:19.288
-So I poke him.

50:19.323 --> 50:20.619
He wakes right up,
pops right up.

50:22.194 --> 50:23.325
"Holy Mother Mary of God,

50:23.360 --> 50:24.458
pray for us sinners!"

50:24.493 --> 50:26.427
Holy Mary!

50:26.462 --> 50:29.265
Mother of God!

50:29.300 --> 50:30.431
"Pray for us sinners!"

50:30.466 --> 50:32.829
Pray for us sinners!

50:32.864 --> 50:34.864
"Holy Mother Mary of God,
pray for us..."

50:34.899 --> 50:36.536
Now and at the hour

50:36.571 --> 50:38.340
-of our death!
-- "Pray for us!

50:38.375 --> 50:40.738
-Pray for us!"

50:40.773 --> 50:42.674
-"Pray for us."
-Pray for us sinners!

50:42.709 --> 50:44.841
-"Pray for us."
-Pray for us.

50:44.876 --> 50:46.249
Oh!

50:46.284 --> 50:48.284
Ho ho!

50:48.319 --> 50:52.222
I'll tell you, Joe, one of
the damnedest things I ever saw.

50:52.257 --> 50:54.620
I don't mean to sound rude,
and, uh...

50:54.655 --> 50:56.853
well, maybe I missed something,

50:56.888 --> 50:59.889
but why exactly did you
do that to him again?

50:59.924 --> 51:04.432
I mean, minus the fact that you
found it mildly entertaining.

51:04.467 --> 51:07.171
Because anyone selling God
is the ultimate pro,

51:07.206 --> 51:10.339
and anyone buying him
is the ultimate sucker.

51:10.374 --> 51:13.243
And only a prideful,
arrogant son of a bitch

51:13.278 --> 51:15.245
would think that in a world
this big and shitty,

51:15.280 --> 51:16.873
with all the pain and suffering
that people endure,

51:16.908 --> 51:18.512
that there's some old man

51:18.547 --> 51:20.184
sitting up there
somewhere in a cloud

51:20.219 --> 51:21.614
who gives a rat's ass
about any one of us

51:21.649 --> 51:23.682
down here. Unh-unh.

51:23.717 --> 51:26.190
There ain't. And if there was
and he did, that was then,

51:26.225 --> 51:28.720
this is now,
and he is long gone.

51:29.954 --> 51:32.361
Well, what happened
to the salesman?

51:32.396 --> 51:34.759
Oh. Him?

51:35.762 --> 51:37.465
- Yeah. Him.

51:37.500 --> 51:39.632
I cut him loose.
Mm-hmm.

51:39.667 --> 51:41.667
I pointed him
in the right direction,

51:41.702 --> 51:45.209
-and I sent him on his way.
-That's all?

51:45.244 --> 51:49.378
Well, I did tell him if
he were to come out here again,

51:49.413 --> 51:51.446
he wouldn't be leaving.

51:51.481 --> 51:52.909
Yeah, I'm certain
he believed me.

51:52.944 --> 51:54.284
I ain't never seen him since.

51:56.882 --> 51:58.486
Wow.

51:58.521 --> 52:00.323
-More coffee?
-No!

52:00.358 --> 52:03.953
Uh, I-I mean no, thank you.
I'm good.

52:03.988 --> 52:05.658
Sheep dip?

52:05.693 --> 52:07.924
-Excuse me?

52:07.959 --> 52:09.695
Hooch.

52:09.730 --> 52:11.565
Shine.

52:11.600 --> 52:13.369
Stump liquor.
Alcohol!

52:13.404 --> 52:14.634
Joe, you want some alcohol?

52:14.669 --> 52:17.901
No. No, thank you.
I'm -- I'm good.

52:17.936 --> 52:20.838
I think I'll avoid all liquids,
if that's okay with you.

52:20.873 --> 52:22.675
Oh, why?

52:22.710 --> 52:25.315
You think I'm gonna drug you
or something?

52:25.350 --> 52:26.943
Well, excuse me
if I'm a little skeptical

52:26.978 --> 52:28.747
after this story I just heard.

52:28.782 --> 52:32.256
Relax, Joe.
I ain't gonna drug you.

52:32.291 --> 52:35.589
It was a long time ago
that fellow was out here.

52:35.624 --> 52:39.890
Besides, I'm pretty sure
I ain't got any of that...

52:39.925 --> 52:41.529
Ain't got none left.

52:41.564 --> 52:46.237
No, I run out
of my sleepy time elixir.

52:49.308 --> 52:54.245
Anyway, I told you
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

52:54.940 --> 52:57.974
You remember what I said
about a man keeping his word,

52:58.009 --> 52:59.415
never breaking it for nothing?

52:59.450 --> 53:01.252
You remember that, don't you?

53:01.287 --> 53:02.880
-Yes, sir.
-I meant it.

53:02.915 --> 53:04.981
I ain't gonna hurt you, Joe.

53:06.721 --> 53:09.293
Now have a drink with me.

53:10.461 --> 53:11.823
I insist.

53:12.694 --> 53:13.957
-All right, then.

53:13.992 --> 53:15.662
Now you're talking!

53:15.697 --> 53:17.466
Yeah.

53:17.501 --> 53:20.469
Okay.
Let's dig out a jar or two.

53:26.675 --> 53:28.312
Why don't you go have a seat?

53:29.579 --> 53:31.007
Yes, sir.

53:38.555 --> 53:41.358
- Yeah. Yeah.

53:42.955 --> 53:45.923
You ever try it?

53:46.695 --> 53:48.299
Moonshine?

53:48.334 --> 53:53.337
I call this batch "The Mule."

53:53.372 --> 53:55.669
You know why?

53:55.704 --> 53:58.507
Because it has a kick?

53:58.542 --> 53:59.805
- Bingo.

53:59.840 --> 54:02.841
Here. Pick your poison.

54:08.849 --> 54:10.750
What's it taste like?

54:10.785 --> 54:12.587
- Gasoline.

54:12.622 --> 54:13.786
-And you like that?
-Psh!

54:13.821 --> 54:15.425
It's why I make it.

54:15.460 --> 54:18.956
I love it, Joe.
It's mother's milk to me.

54:20.025 --> 54:21.662
What should we drink to?

54:21.697 --> 54:25.798
Oh, um, I know.

54:25.833 --> 54:28.405
To all that death...

54:28.440 --> 54:30.066
and beauty.

54:44.082 --> 54:46.885
I told you.

54:46.920 --> 54:48.722
-Whew!
-You weren't kidding.

54:51.925 --> 54:53.122
Got a kick, don't it?

54:56.127 --> 55:00.602
When I have a little bit
of The Mule,

55:00.637 --> 55:03.066
I like to have a smoke.

55:04.806 --> 55:06.773
When I have a smoke,

55:06.808 --> 55:12.009
I like to put on
my smoking robe. Yeah.

55:13.782 --> 55:15.012
Yeah.

55:19.920 --> 55:21.623
You care for one?

55:21.658 --> 55:24.593
Oh, no, thank you.
I don't smoke.

55:24.628 --> 55:28.157
Oh, okay. You don't smoke,
and you don't chew,

55:28.192 --> 55:31.501
and you don't go
with gals who do, huh?

55:31.536 --> 55:33.096
Ha ha!

55:33.131 --> 55:35.098
I just know
I don't like smoking.

55:35.133 --> 55:37.936
But, I mean, please feel free.

55:39.137 --> 55:42.545
Oh, I see. So you're...

55:42.580 --> 55:45.911
you're giving me permission
to smoke in my own home?

55:45.946 --> 55:47.781
Is that what's happening?

55:47.816 --> 55:49.981
No, I didn't mean it to...

55:50.016 --> 55:51.851
Relax, Joe.
I'm just...

55:51.886 --> 55:53.490
I'm just fooling with you.

55:53.525 --> 55:54.953
Tell me something.

55:58.893 --> 56:00.090
Where you from?

56:01.632 --> 56:03.863
You mean like originally?

56:03.898 --> 56:06.503
Yeah.

56:06.538 --> 56:08.439
- Well, originally,
I'm from a small town

56:08.474 --> 56:10.969
on the Ohio River
called New Albany.

56:11.004 --> 56:14.709
It's in southern Indiana,
right across from Louisville.

56:14.744 --> 56:17.041
But we moved to Chattanooga
when I was 8 years old,

56:17.076 --> 56:19.912
and I've been in Tennessee
ever since.

56:19.947 --> 56:21.947
That's where you live now --
Chattanooga?

56:21.982 --> 56:25.588
No, sir. My wife and I moved
to Knoxville a few years back.

56:25.623 --> 56:27.986
What's her name?
Your wife?

56:28.021 --> 56:31.154
Eugenia,
but everyone calls her Genie.

56:31.189 --> 56:33.860
Genie. Hm.

56:33.895 --> 56:36.863
And what does she do?

56:36.898 --> 56:39.129
She bake cakes?

56:39.164 --> 56:41.032
No, she's a schoolteacher.

56:41.067 --> 56:42.671
Second grade.

56:42.706 --> 56:45.036
We moved to Knoxville
a few years ago

56:45.071 --> 56:48.710
because I got a job working
for her family's moving company,

56:48.745 --> 56:52.780
and she got a job at a primary
school out there, so...

56:52.815 --> 56:57.818
So the summary of your life
up to this point

56:57.853 --> 57:04.693
is that you're from New Albany,

57:04.728 --> 57:07.498
you grew up in Chattanooga,

57:07.533 --> 57:11.766
you met a girl, you got married,
you moved to Knoxville,

57:11.801 --> 57:14.769
and now you work
for her family.

57:14.804 --> 57:17.541
That about the long and short
of it?

57:20.139 --> 57:21.941
Yeah.

57:21.976 --> 57:24.042
Wow.

57:24.077 --> 57:25.483
What?

57:26.651 --> 57:28.948
Oh, it's nothing.
You just...

57:30.688 --> 57:33.821
You just boiled my entire life
down to one sentence.

57:33.856 --> 57:36.560
Oh, don't feel bad about that,
Joe.

57:38.091 --> 57:40.564
It's the same for most people,
if you think about it.

57:43.668 --> 57:44.997
Can I ask you something?

57:46.297 --> 57:47.802
Sure.

57:51.577 --> 57:53.874
You ever get the feeling
like sometimes life

57:53.909 --> 57:56.008
is conspiring against you?

57:57.748 --> 58:00.012
Conspiring?

58:01.587 --> 58:03.147
What do you mean?

58:04.018 --> 58:05.952
Well, like it's working
against you.

58:05.987 --> 58:08.625
To hurt you.
To break you in some way.

58:10.629 --> 58:12.090
Yeah.

58:12.125 --> 58:14.598
Maybe sometimes.

58:14.633 --> 58:17.293
I've been feeling that way
a lot lately.

58:17.328 --> 58:20.065
Like there's something
much larger than me out there

58:20.100 --> 58:21.737
trying to smother me,

58:21.772 --> 58:23.805
trying to extinguish me
in some way.

58:23.840 --> 58:26.302
And no matter what I do
or how hard I try,

58:26.337 --> 58:29.811
I just can't seem to make it go
away or let up a little.

58:32.145 --> 58:33.848
- I think...

58:33.883 --> 58:39.590
I think everybody feels
that way from time to time.

58:42.991 --> 58:44.089
Do they?

58:44.894 --> 58:46.762
Absolutely.

58:48.062 --> 58:50.293
Well, maybe you're right.

58:52.198 --> 58:54.935
I just never felt
that way before.

58:59.205 --> 59:02.173
Well, tell me, how --

59:02.208 --> 59:06.342
Just how is it that you do feel?

59:11.690 --> 59:14.625
It feels a little like
I'm standing in wet cement,

59:14.660 --> 59:19.256
you know, and my eyes are open,
and I'm looking everywhere.

59:19.291 --> 59:23.062
Only there's nothing else
around me.

59:23.097 --> 59:26.131
There's just this nothingness,
this void.

59:26.166 --> 59:29.332
And I can feel the cement
hardening and tightening

59:29.367 --> 59:31.642
around my ankles and getting
heavier and heavier

59:31.677 --> 59:34.975
until finally it sets,
and I can't move.

59:35.010 --> 59:37.076
My eyes are open,
and I'm looking everywhere,

59:37.111 --> 59:39.342
but there's nothing to see.

59:40.081 --> 59:42.917
And then this slow suffocation
starts at my feet

59:42.952 --> 59:45.348
and moves up my legs
and the back of my spine

59:45.383 --> 59:47.251
until it settles
at the back of my throat

59:47.286 --> 59:49.055
and cuts all the air off.

59:49.090 --> 59:52.795
So it's like I'm paralyzed,
choking, and blind,

59:52.830 --> 59:55.028
and I can't do
anything about it.

59:55.063 --> 59:57.767
And the whole time, I'm wide
awake while it's happening.

59:57.802 --> 59:59.769
That's what it feels like.

1:00:02.906 --> 1:00:05.005
- Shit, man.

1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:07.172
Sounds fucking awful.

1:00:07.207 --> 1:00:08.943
I mean, it sounds...

1:00:10.914 --> 1:00:12.650
It sounds pretty heavy.

1:00:14.214 --> 1:00:16.082
It<i> is</i> heavy.

1:00:16.117 --> 1:00:18.084
All of it.

1:00:21.056 --> 1:00:23.023
My whole life...

1:00:25.764 --> 1:00:29.359
I mean, my whole life,
I've done everything right.

1:00:30.197 --> 1:00:32.230
I went to school.

1:00:33.365 --> 1:00:35.200
I made good marks.

1:00:35.235 --> 1:00:37.004
I never got in trouble.

1:00:37.039 --> 1:00:38.302
Always had a job.

1:00:39.778 --> 1:00:42.240
I never disrespected anybody.

1:00:42.275 --> 1:00:44.407
I never broke the rules.

1:00:44.442 --> 1:00:47.751
"Yes, sir," "No, sir" -- Always.

1:00:47.786 --> 1:00:49.412
I did everything
I was told to do.

1:00:49.447 --> 1:00:52.382
Everything I was supposed to do.

1:00:53.220 --> 1:00:55.352
Still, I feel this weight.

1:01:02.031 --> 1:01:04.867
I feel like it's been
crushing me lately.

1:01:08.235 --> 1:01:09.839
- Oh.

1:01:09.874 --> 1:01:11.775
What's that?

1:01:12.943 --> 1:01:16.142
Uh, we need a fire.

1:01:18.410 --> 1:01:20.344
- Oh.

1:01:30.455 --> 1:01:33.093
Well, it's...

1:01:34.129 --> 1:01:38.395
...let up a little anyway.

1:01:40.300 --> 1:01:42.267
Well, we'll...

1:01:45.041 --> 1:01:47.844
We'll put you to work, huh?

1:01:59.187 --> 1:02:01.451
Yeah, it's not that bad out,

1:02:01.486 --> 1:02:05.125
but grab about
half a dozen of those.

1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:07.864
Attaboy. Yeah. Be quick.

1:02:07.899 --> 1:02:12.198
Hey, what about your wife?

1:02:12.233 --> 1:02:13.969
- My wife?

1:02:14.004 --> 1:02:15.465
Well, what about her?

1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:19.073
- Well, have you --
Have you talked to her?

1:02:19.108 --> 1:02:21.042
Tell her about how you feel?

1:02:21.077 --> 1:02:22.340
- Not really.

1:02:22.375 --> 1:02:24.012
- Why not?

1:02:24.047 --> 1:02:28.214
- She -- She's been
a little...distant lately.

1:02:28.249 --> 1:02:31.514
- Oh.
She been off somewhere?

1:02:31.549 --> 1:02:33.890
- No.

1:02:33.925 --> 1:02:35.925
Oh, distant like...

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:38.862
like distance.

1:02:38.897 --> 1:02:40.226
Yeah, I get it.

1:02:42.901 --> 1:02:45.264
Yeah, they can...

1:02:45.299 --> 1:02:49.598
They sure can get that way
from time to time. Yeah.

1:02:49.633 --> 1:02:54.042
Heh. My goddamn wife,
man, she can go weeks sometimes

1:02:54.077 --> 1:02:55.505
without saying a single word
to me

1:02:55.540 --> 1:02:59.443
on account of she's mad
about one thing or other,

1:02:59.478 --> 1:03:01.885
but personally, I never mind it

1:03:01.920 --> 1:03:05.515
'cause I kind of like
the peace and quiet.

1:03:07.090 --> 1:03:09.288
Still...

1:03:09.323 --> 1:03:13.424
yeah, you might want
to tell her,

1:03:13.459 --> 1:03:15.591
you know,
about what you're feeling.

1:03:15.626 --> 1:03:17.296
Who knows?
Maybe she can help.

1:03:17.331 --> 1:03:19.034
Just set them down.

1:03:25.141 --> 1:03:27.141
I don't think so.

1:03:27.176 --> 1:03:28.879
Well, why not?

1:03:28.914 --> 1:03:30.914
Well...

1:03:31.444 --> 1:03:35.083
...we've -- we've been having
some issues lately.

1:03:35.118 --> 1:03:37.184
What kind of issues?

1:03:39.287 --> 1:03:42.288
You sure you don't mind me
talking to you about this?

1:03:42.323 --> 1:03:43.894
Keep going.

1:03:45.964 --> 1:03:49.900
Well, me and
my wife, Genie, you know,

1:03:49.935 --> 1:03:52.265
we've known each other
since we were kids.

1:03:52.300 --> 1:03:53.904
You know, we grew up together,

1:03:53.939 --> 1:03:56.071
went to school together
in Chattanooga.

1:03:56.106 --> 1:03:59.569
But sometimes I feel like
we come from different places,

1:03:59.604 --> 1:04:01.912
mainly because
she grew up with money

1:04:01.947 --> 1:04:04.013
-and I grew up with nothing.
-Oh.

1:04:04.048 --> 1:04:06.510
Blue-blood snoot.

1:04:07.546 --> 1:04:11.119
And then there's
this other issue.

1:04:11.154 --> 1:04:13.187
- What other issue?

1:04:15.686 --> 1:04:18.093
Well, it's kind
of embarrassing.

1:04:18.128 --> 1:04:20.194
Look, I ain't gonna judge you,
Joe.

1:04:22.066 --> 1:04:24.264
And then...

1:04:24.299 --> 1:04:27.201
well, we've been having a hard
time trying to have a baby.

1:04:27.236 --> 1:04:28.499
- Ah.

1:04:28.534 --> 1:04:31.469
And it's caused some problems.

1:04:31.504 --> 1:04:33.504
Shooting blanks, are you?

1:04:33.539 --> 1:04:34.945
No.

1:04:34.980 --> 1:04:37.178
It -- It's not me, okay?

1:04:37.213 --> 1:04:39.213
I'm not the one
with the problem.

1:04:39.248 --> 1:04:42.953
Okay, Joe. I'm just standing
here, listening. That's all.

1:04:42.988 --> 1:04:46.583
It's just, she thinks it's me,
but it's not.

1:04:46.618 --> 1:04:49.520
I mean,
she's convinced I'm the problem.

1:04:51.392 --> 1:04:54.459
So she's been seeing some...

1:04:54.494 --> 1:04:56.230
Some what?

1:04:58.498 --> 1:05:00.300
Well, it...

1:05:00.335 --> 1:05:01.367
It doesn't matter.

1:05:01.402 --> 1:05:02.973
Yeah, but...

1:05:03.701 --> 1:05:05.635
...I want to hear...

1:05:05.670 --> 1:05:07.010
hear some more.

1:05:07.045 --> 1:05:08.209
Oh.

1:05:10.708 --> 1:05:12.950
Tell me, though.

1:05:13.711 --> 1:05:15.612
Your wife.

1:05:17.583 --> 1:05:19.649
Well, what's she like?

1:05:23.391 --> 1:05:26.656
- She has
the most beautiful red hair.

1:05:29.100 --> 1:05:31.496
And these eyes.

1:05:33.665 --> 1:05:35.368
You could get lost in them.

1:05:39.440 --> 1:05:43.376
Well, does she appreciate you?

1:05:44.379 --> 1:05:46.709
Well, I mean,

1:05:46.744 --> 1:05:50.449
she thinks I could do more
with my life, that's for sure.

1:05:50.484 --> 1:05:52.253
- Yeah.

1:05:53.124 --> 1:05:56.092
You told me -- You said earlier

1:05:56.127 --> 1:05:58.160
that you're a working man,
right?

1:06:00.098 --> 1:06:01.724
-Yes, sir.
-Ah.

1:06:01.759 --> 1:06:05.497
And what is it that you do?

1:06:05.532 --> 1:06:08.599
I drive a truck for my
father-in-law's moving company

1:06:08.634 --> 1:06:10.601
and a couple of other odd jobs
here and there

1:06:10.636 --> 1:06:13.439
-to make ends meet.
-Well, all right.

1:06:13.474 --> 1:06:15.375
Yeah. Whew.

1:06:18.611 --> 1:06:21.117
You're getting paid. Yeah.

1:06:21.152 --> 1:06:22.778
You're making money.

1:06:24.353 --> 1:06:28.685
I mean, you're not one of those
freeloading sons of bitches

1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:31.655
collecting checks from the
government every month, are you?

1:06:31.690 --> 1:06:33.360
No, sir.

1:06:34.264 --> 1:06:35.791
No.

1:06:35.826 --> 1:06:37.496
There.

1:06:37.795 --> 1:06:40.136
Yeah, well -- ha ha --

1:06:40.171 --> 1:06:41.434
that's good.

1:06:44.274 --> 1:06:46.109
You can be proud.

1:06:47.244 --> 1:06:49.442
Yeah. Look, Joe,

1:06:49.477 --> 1:06:53.116
you got to look
for the silver lining.

1:06:53.151 --> 1:06:55.151
You got to find
that silver lining

1:06:55.186 --> 1:06:57.483
in pretty much, well...

1:06:57.518 --> 1:06:59.716
in everything. Yeah.

1:07:00.554 --> 1:07:04.193
She don't appreciate
a man provides -- phft --

1:07:04.228 --> 1:07:05.689
that's on her.

1:07:12.137 --> 1:07:13.169
I guess so.

1:07:13.204 --> 1:07:16.139
- Shit, I<i> know</i> so.

1:07:16.174 --> 1:07:20.770
My wife is ungrateful six ways
to Sunday, let me tell you.

1:07:20.805 --> 1:07:23.806
But, then again, they all are
in their own way.

1:07:23.841 --> 1:07:25.181
You know, women.

1:07:25.216 --> 1:07:27.282
Women.

1:07:27.317 --> 1:07:32.452
Ooh, they make a man do all sort
of stupid through his lifetime.

1:07:33.158 --> 1:07:37.160
Drive you to the brink
of insanity. Yeah.

1:07:38.163 --> 1:07:41.197
If you don't mind me asking,

1:07:41.232 --> 1:07:44.134
well, what happened with you
and your wife?

1:07:44.169 --> 1:07:48.501
You know, I mean,
well, why did it end?

1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:53.440
It ended 'cause
she finally figured it out.

1:07:54.674 --> 1:07:57.345
Figured what out?

1:07:57.380 --> 1:07:59.677
How to really hurt a man.

1:08:06.356 --> 1:08:11.161
Hey, Joe, I know
I asked you this already,

1:08:11.196 --> 1:08:15.561
but you really don't remember
how you come to be here?

1:08:17.367 --> 1:08:19.367
Not really.

1:08:21.206 --> 1:08:25.472
You tried retracing your steps?

1:08:26.706 --> 1:08:28.376
No.

1:08:28.411 --> 1:08:31.181
- Well, going back,

1:08:31.216 --> 1:08:33.414
start at the beginning.

1:08:34.747 --> 1:08:37.418
Mm...beginning?

1:08:37.453 --> 1:08:40.487
Well, yeah,
that's what I would do.

1:08:42.557 --> 1:08:46.295
Well, I came
by way of Knoxville,

1:08:46.330 --> 1:08:48.924
and I drove into Elkmont

1:08:48.959 --> 1:08:52.400
because I wanted to take a hike
along the Little River.

1:08:52.435 --> 1:08:55.733
I told you I used to fly-fish it
when I was a boy.

1:08:55.768 --> 1:08:59.374
It's always been
one of my favorite places.

1:08:59.409 --> 1:09:02.674
I mean, the truth is, I hadn't
been in these woods in decades.

1:09:02.709 --> 1:09:06.546
How come
you come out here today?

1:09:06.581 --> 1:09:09.384
Well, like I said, I've been...

1:09:09.419 --> 1:09:11.254
dealing with some issues lately,

1:09:11.289 --> 1:09:13.916
so I guess I thought
that coming back to a place

1:09:13.951 --> 1:09:15.588
that I had fond memories of,

1:09:15.623 --> 1:09:16.952
of where I'd been happy
at one point,

1:09:16.987 --> 1:09:20.725
is where I needed
to be to get my mind right.

1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:24.597
So I got off work and drove
an hour south to Elkmont,

1:09:24.632 --> 1:09:26.896
and I took the trail,
and I started walking.

1:09:26.931 --> 1:09:28.898
Oh, but then I...

1:09:31.309 --> 1:09:32.902
What?

1:09:37.942 --> 1:09:43.484
Well, when I got
to Burnt Mountain, I...

1:09:43.519 --> 1:09:45.717
I heard something.

1:09:46.588 --> 1:09:48.819
What did you hear?

1:09:49.558 --> 1:09:51.294
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

1:09:51.329 --> 1:09:52.625
What did you hear?

1:09:55.300 --> 1:09:57.993
Well, it was -- It was --

1:09:58.028 --> 1:10:01.997
-Well, it was like a moan.
-A moan.

1:10:04.969 --> 1:10:08.377
Yes. Like deep breaths

1:10:08.412 --> 1:10:10.874
I could feel building
inside my head.

1:10:10.909 --> 1:10:14.977
Only -- Only they were coming
from somewhere else.

1:10:15.012 --> 1:10:17.848
So I started walking
towards them,

1:10:17.883 --> 1:10:20.851
and, well, then that took me
off the trail I was on.

1:10:20.886 --> 1:10:23.491
And as I got deeper
and deeper into the woods,

1:10:23.526 --> 1:10:25.625
this moan just got
louder and louder.

1:10:25.660 --> 1:10:27.825
So I ran.

1:10:27.860 --> 1:10:32.302
I ran as fast and as far
as I could until...

1:10:32.337 --> 1:10:35.602
I mean, everything just went...

1:10:36.341 --> 1:10:37.505
-Black.

1:10:37.540 --> 1:10:38.935
-...black.

1:10:41.775 --> 1:10:44.380
I must have passed out
or something

1:10:44.415 --> 1:10:46.778
because when I came to,
it was too late.

1:10:46.813 --> 1:10:48.714
I mean, I got all turned around.

1:10:48.749 --> 1:10:52.949
I didn't know where I was,
and I couldn't find my way back.

1:10:52.984 --> 1:10:55.391
So I started walking again.

1:10:57.021 --> 1:11:00.055
And I came across
this waterfall.

1:11:02.466 --> 1:11:04.631
And I came upon a clearing.

1:11:08.736 --> 1:11:12.034
And that's when I found
your cabin

1:11:12.069 --> 1:11:14.542
and the smoke
coming from the chimney.

1:11:18.042 --> 1:11:20.042
Well...

1:11:20.077 --> 1:11:22.616
that is...

1:11:23.751 --> 1:11:25.080
...interesting, Joe.

1:11:25.115 --> 1:11:31.328
That is
very, very, very interesting.

1:11:32.958 --> 1:11:34.958
Why?

1:11:36.698 --> 1:11:37.928
- Hm.

1:11:40.735 --> 1:11:43.736
Okay. Words.

1:11:45.443 --> 1:11:46.970
Words, words.

1:11:48.479 --> 1:11:51.480
Always the same goddamn words.

1:11:52.681 --> 1:11:54.582
There.

1:11:54.617 --> 1:11:56.045
Sit there.

1:12:03.494 --> 1:12:05.428
What are you talking about?

1:12:07.058 --> 1:12:08.662
Well...

1:12:13.636 --> 1:12:16.131
...a long, long time ago,

1:12:16.166 --> 1:12:18.133
the Cherokee people,
the Indians,

1:12:18.168 --> 1:12:21.642
they lived in these lands,

1:12:21.677 --> 1:12:27.076
and they had a story
about the purple lake.

1:12:27.111 --> 1:12:28.715
The purple lake?

1:12:28.750 --> 1:12:34.050
This lake was hidden
deep in the Smokies.

1:12:34.888 --> 1:12:38.791
And they looked for it,
but they could never find it.

1:12:38.826 --> 1:12:40.122
But they wanted to find it

1:12:40.157 --> 1:12:43.697
'cause they said
that it had special powers.

1:12:43.732 --> 1:12:47.701
And the only ones
who knew how to find the lake

1:12:47.736 --> 1:12:50.000
were the animals.

1:12:50.035 --> 1:12:52.838
And the animals
knew how to find the lake,

1:12:52.873 --> 1:12:54.642
but they weren't telling nobody

1:12:54.677 --> 1:12:56.743
because they wanted to keep it
a secret,

1:12:56.778 --> 1:13:00.846
because I guess
if they got ever hurt

1:13:00.881 --> 1:13:05.114
or injured or sick,

1:13:05.149 --> 1:13:08.557
all they had to do was drink the
water, and they would be healed.

1:13:08.592 --> 1:13:12.693
Well, then I found it...

1:13:18.932 --> 1:13:20.195
Huh.

1:13:20.230 --> 1:13:22.637
...and I got hurt.

1:13:22.672 --> 1:13:25.970
Not, like, so much physical,

1:13:26.005 --> 1:13:29.677
like a busted rib
or a broken leg or anything,

1:13:29.712 --> 1:13:34.517
but more something
you can't see.

1:13:34.552 --> 1:13:37.949
I was damaged, I guess.

1:13:37.984 --> 1:13:43.691
So, anyway, I thought I would
come out to these mountains

1:13:43.726 --> 1:13:45.858
like when I was a boy.

1:13:47.565 --> 1:13:49.026
And if I could find that lake

1:13:49.061 --> 1:13:52.766
and maybe take a drink,

1:13:52.801 --> 1:13:54.999
then I would be healed, too.

1:13:56.068 --> 1:13:59.102
But I couldn't find it.

1:13:59.137 --> 1:14:03.810
Searched all over
these mountains.

1:14:03.845 --> 1:14:07.110
And then, one day,
just out of the blue,

1:14:07.145 --> 1:14:08.518
I heard...

1:14:11.556 --> 1:14:13.281
The moan.

1:14:13.316 --> 1:14:15.525
Yeah.

1:14:17.991 --> 1:14:20.530
I followed it.
Then I run from it.

1:14:20.565 --> 1:14:23.258
I didn't know what to do.

1:14:25.229 --> 1:14:29.968
But it got louder and louder
inside of my head.

1:14:31.202 --> 1:14:33.675
It...

1:14:33.710 --> 1:14:35.006
I just backtracked.

1:14:35.041 --> 1:14:38.009
Then when I woke up...

1:14:38.044 --> 1:14:39.945
you know what I saw?

1:14:42.719 --> 1:14:44.114
-Her.

1:14:44.149 --> 1:14:47.623
She was looking at me
with death in her eyes.

1:14:47.658 --> 1:14:49.856
And I didn't want to die.

1:14:49.891 --> 1:14:52.188
And she has a choke on me,

1:14:52.223 --> 1:14:55.092
and I thought I'd fight.

1:14:55.127 --> 1:14:59.800
And there was
a jagged, sharp rock by my feet,

1:14:59.835 --> 1:15:01.230
and I bent down,

1:15:01.265 --> 1:15:04.068
and I picked up that stone.

1:15:04.906 --> 1:15:07.841
Me and her
were eyeball to eyeball.

1:15:07.876 --> 1:15:10.074
She pounced on me,

1:15:10.109 --> 1:15:11.713
and I brought my arm down,

1:15:11.748 --> 1:15:15.079
and I jammed that rock
right into her neck.

1:15:16.654 --> 1:15:18.588
She took me down.

1:15:18.623 --> 1:15:22.350
And we were sprawled out
together.

1:15:22.385 --> 1:15:26.288
And there was blood everywhere,
man.

1:15:26.323 --> 1:15:28.829
Blood all over me.

1:15:28.864 --> 1:15:31.898
And I watched as the light
went out of those eyes.

1:15:34.133 --> 1:15:37.739
And the moan stopped.

1:15:42.779 --> 1:15:44.713
And you've been out here
ever since?

1:15:44.748 --> 1:15:46.946
Yep.

1:15:46.981 --> 1:15:49.652
All alone.

1:15:49.687 --> 1:15:52.886
Alone? No.

1:15:52.921 --> 1:15:57.594
No, I got -- I got the Rascal.

1:15:59.763 --> 1:16:04.634
If I'm honest, it's the Rascal
that keeps me alive.

1:16:04.669 --> 1:16:07.032
He's a treacherous little shit.

1:16:08.772 --> 1:16:10.398
But he's all I got.

1:16:10.433 --> 1:16:13.742
You got me now, too.

1:16:13.777 --> 1:16:15.106
Oh.

1:16:15.141 --> 1:16:17.977
Hold on there.
Be careful.

1:16:18.716 --> 1:16:21.849
I might start to like you, Joe.

1:16:22.346 --> 1:16:25.149
Well, we wouldn't want that,
now, would we?

1:16:25.184 --> 1:16:27.085
I don't know.

1:16:29.056 --> 1:16:30.660
Why don't you...

1:16:32.796 --> 1:16:37.194
...throw a little more kindling
into that stove? And...

1:16:37.229 --> 1:16:42.001
I'll see if I can find us
something to eat.

1:16:42.036 --> 1:16:45.037
I got some canned goods
back here.

1:16:45.072 --> 1:16:47.171
-That sound all right?
-Yes, sir.

1:16:47.206 --> 1:16:48.876
You're a good man.

1:16:59.988 --> 1:17:02.120
Sheesh.

1:17:21.042 --> 1:17:23.779
-You all right, Joe?
-Yes, sir.

1:17:29.116 --> 1:17:31.347
I was just thinking
about my wife, is all.

1:17:31.382 --> 1:17:33.316
- Oh.

1:17:34.121 --> 1:17:36.055
What about her?

1:17:39.896 --> 1:17:43.161
I wasn't being
completely honest with you.

1:17:54.174 --> 1:17:57.043
- Oh.
Well, how's that?

1:18:04.118 --> 1:18:08.956
We got into a pretty bad fight
before I came out here.

1:18:08.991 --> 1:18:12.487
- That'll pass.
Usually does.

1:18:12.522 --> 1:18:14.258
She'll come around.

1:18:15.558 --> 1:18:18.163
I don't know about that.

1:18:20.904 --> 1:18:22.871
It didn't end well.

1:18:22.906 --> 1:18:27.007
- I wouldn't
worry about it if I was you.

1:18:27.042 --> 1:18:31.044
There's only so much
a fella can do

1:18:31.079 --> 1:18:34.311
in a fight with his lady.

1:18:35.149 --> 1:18:37.512
Yeah, women.

1:18:37.547 --> 1:18:40.515
Can't live with them.

1:18:40.550 --> 1:18:43.089
Sure can't kill them.

1:18:44.521 --> 1:18:46.488
Hey, Joe.

1:18:46.523 --> 1:18:50.932
Sure hope you like
peas and rice.

1:18:50.967 --> 1:18:54.100
-Oh! Oh.

1:18:54.135 --> 1:18:55.233
Yeah.

1:19:23.494 --> 1:19:26.968
You've been telling stories.

1:19:34.241 --> 1:19:36.274
Where's Joe?

1:19:36.309 --> 1:19:38.243
-Who?
-Joe.

1:19:38.278 --> 1:19:40.080
Where is he?

1:19:40.115 --> 1:19:42.577
- You're losing your mind,
old man.

1:19:42.612 --> 1:19:46.251
Ain't nobody been here
but you and me.

1:19:47.958 --> 1:19:50.926
But you were gone.

1:19:50.961 --> 1:19:52.224
- Hmm.

1:19:55.097 --> 1:19:58.032
I had to find us food, didn't I?

1:20:00.333 --> 1:20:04.071
But what -- what happened
to Joe?

1:20:04.106 --> 1:20:07.404
Words, words, words.

1:20:07.439 --> 1:20:11.408
It's always the same
goddamn words with you.

1:20:11.443 --> 1:20:13.344
Why don't you take
a seat over there?

1:20:13.379 --> 1:20:16.149
You know, you seem
a little confused.

1:20:16.184 --> 1:20:18.349
-But...
-Sit down!

1:20:18.384 --> 1:20:20.087
No, no! No, no.

1:20:20.122 --> 1:20:23.156
Not till you tell me
what you did to Joe.

1:20:23.191 --> 1:20:24.520
'Cause I know you did something.

1:20:24.555 --> 1:20:26.588
Now you tell me.

1:20:26.623 --> 1:20:27.996
Yeah.

1:20:28.031 --> 1:20:30.361
I ain't telling you nothing!

1:20:30.396 --> 1:20:32.099
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1:20:32.134 --> 1:20:33.628
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:20:35.632 --> 1:20:38.237
Jesus fucking Christ.

1:20:38.272 --> 1:20:41.911
I'm...scared.

1:20:43.178 --> 1:20:46.179
You're pathetic.
You know that?

1:20:46.214 --> 1:20:47.983
You tell me.

1:20:48.018 --> 1:20:51.613
You tell me what you did,
or so help me. I swear.

1:20:51.648 --> 1:20:55.551
-You'll what?
-I'll -- I'll -- I'll...

1:20:55.586 --> 1:20:59.192
-You'll shoot me?
-Don't make me do it.

1:20:59.227 --> 1:21:01.161
You ain't gonna do nothing,
and you know it.

1:21:01.196 --> 1:21:03.933
I will. I'll shoot.

1:21:03.968 --> 1:21:07.596
Well, then I'll tell you what.

1:21:07.631 --> 1:21:10.566
-Why don't I help you?

1:21:10.601 --> 1:21:13.503
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1:21:13.538 --> 1:21:16.275
-Oh, please. Let this go.
-Do it.

1:21:16.310 --> 1:21:17.980
Don't make me.

1:21:18.015 --> 1:21:19.542
-Do it, God damn it!
-Aah! Aah!

1:21:19.577 --> 1:21:23.183
The same every time with you.

1:21:25.088 --> 1:21:27.957
-I'm sorry.

1:21:29.290 --> 1:21:33.127
Yeah, you've been sorry
your whole life. You know that.

1:21:34.031 --> 1:21:36.394
- I just want to know
what happened to him.

1:21:36.429 --> 1:21:38.627
What'd he look like,
this Joe fella?

1:21:38.662 --> 1:21:42.070
A little like you.
A little like me maybe.

1:21:42.105 --> 1:21:44.204
We go through this every time,
you and me,

1:21:44.239 --> 1:21:48.175
and it's the same goddamn story.

1:21:48.210 --> 1:21:52.278
He was -- He was...

1:21:52.313 --> 1:21:56.348
He was walking in the woods,
and then he saw...

1:21:56.383 --> 1:21:59.615
Smoke coming from the chimney.

1:21:59.650 --> 1:22:01.452
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:22:01.487 --> 1:22:04.125
- Yeah, I know.

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:07.623
And it's always
the same goddamn words with you.

1:22:07.658 --> 1:22:11.726
Rascal, I am scared.

1:22:11.761 --> 1:22:13.101
You're pathetic.

1:22:13.136 --> 1:22:14.465
Mm.

1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:17.501
-And you're weak.

1:22:17.536 --> 1:22:20.768
It's no wonder she left you.

1:22:20.803 --> 1:22:22.473
Who left?

1:22:22.508 --> 1:22:23.573
Your wife.

1:22:23.608 --> 1:22:26.246
M-My wife.

1:22:26.281 --> 1:22:28.611
- You failed her
in every way, didn't you?

1:22:28.646 --> 1:22:29.711
- Did I?

1:22:29.746 --> 1:22:31.515
You never had enough.

1:22:31.550 --> 1:22:33.484
Always tried to please her.

1:22:33.519 --> 1:22:35.684
Shit, you worked for her daddy.

1:22:35.719 --> 1:22:37.521
You even started selling Bibles

1:22:37.556 --> 1:22:39.292
with her best friend
to try to make ends meet.

1:22:39.327 --> 1:22:43.428
But it wasn't you
who made her happy, was it?

1:22:43.463 --> 1:22:45.298
It was<i> you</i> who got lost
in the woods

1:22:45.333 --> 1:22:47.465
that day after you did
what you did.

1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:49.335
I didn't do nothing.

1:22:49.370 --> 1:22:51.568
-- Yes, you did.

1:22:51.603 --> 1:22:53.273
And I'm getting real tired

1:22:53.308 --> 1:22:58.179
of having to remind you
again and again.

1:22:58.214 --> 1:23:02.183
All right, you tell me --
You tell me what happened.

1:23:05.188 --> 1:23:06.385
Why should I?

1:23:07.157 --> 1:23:09.454
'Cause I want to know.

1:23:09.489 --> 1:23:10.818
You're sure?

1:23:10.853 --> 1:23:13.326
Please, Rascal.

1:23:17.695 --> 1:23:19.200
Oh!

1:23:22.238 --> 1:23:23.567
You found it.

1:23:24.603 --> 1:23:27.703
You found the purple lake.

1:23:28.475 --> 1:23:30.244
Hell, Old Man.

1:23:30.279 --> 1:23:31.542
- Huh?

1:23:31.577 --> 1:23:34.611
I'm the only one
who knows where it is.

1:23:38.254 --> 1:23:39.517
Drink it.

1:23:43.688 --> 1:23:45.490
It ain't gonna hurt me, is it?

1:23:45.525 --> 1:23:49.593
Mm, it's gonna<i> heal</i> you.

1:23:50.365 --> 1:23:51.661
Now drink it.

1:24:31.241 --> 1:24:32.636
Get in.

1:24:37.808 --> 1:24:40.215
What's in there?

1:24:40.250 --> 1:24:42.613
Get in!

1:24:42.648 --> 1:24:45.187
Just tell me what's down there.

1:24:47.290 --> 1:24:49.158
- The next world.

1:25:03.735 --> 1:25:05.207
- Ah.

1:25:37.868 --> 1:25:39.571
Oh.

1:27:31.982 --> 1:27:33.388
Hey.

1:27:40.595 --> 1:27:42.056
Oh, no.

1:27:51.408 --> 1:27:53.771
I don't want to do this.

1:27:55.643 --> 1:27:57.610
No more.

1:27:59.042 --> 1:28:01.581
I want it...

1:28:02.650 --> 1:28:04.419
...to stop.

1:28:04.454 --> 1:28:05.750
Please.

1:28:05.785 --> 1:28:08.753
Oh! No!

1:28:10.119 --> 1:28:11.789
- Please.

1:28:11.824 --> 1:28:14.462
Please forgive me.

1:28:14.497 --> 1:28:15.760
Please.

1:28:15.795 --> 1:28:17.960
"Holy Mary, mother of God."

1:28:17.995 --> 1:28:19.731
Pray for us sinners.

1:28:19.766 --> 1:28:22.899
"Now and at the hour
of our death."

1:28:29.875 --> 1:28:32.007
Forgive me.

1:28:32.042 --> 1:28:34.042
It don't work that way...

1:28:35.782 --> 1:28:37.078
...Joe.

1:28:37.113 --> 1:28:39.388
Please.

1:28:39.423 --> 1:28:41.819
No.

1:29:25.799 --> 1:29:27.095
Coward.

1:29:30.034 --> 1:29:31.869
Coward.

1:30:19.050 --> 1:30:20.984
All that death...

1:30:22.856 --> 1:30:24.988
And?

1:30:32.294 --> 1:30:34.569
And beauty.

1:30:37.266 --> 1:30:40.542
You're looking tired, old man.

1:30:43.272 --> 1:30:46.614
Beauty and death.

1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:53.687
You need to rest now.

1:31:21.948 --> 1:31:24.685
- Okay.

1:31:37.194 --> 1:31:39.700
I'll come back later.

1:31:41.968 --> 1:31:43.935
I always do.

1:32:44.261 --> 1:32:46.800
Oh!

1:32:59.947 --> 1:33:01.749
Rascal?
