00:03.644 --> 00:05.936
I'm so glad you're moving
out of this neighborhood Annie.

00:05.937 --> 00:08.266
Some dude peed on my car
while I was parking it.

00:09.066 --> 00:11.050
Oh, you met spaghetti!

00:11.084 --> 00:14.086
- Yeah, I won't miss him.
- Speaking of missing people,

00:14.121 --> 00:17.623
how did Jeff dodge this
bullet...Of friendship.

00:17.658 --> 00:20.259
He said he was
under the weather.

00:20.294 --> 00:22.628
- Pshaw!
- Thanks for helping.

00:22.663 --> 00:24.030
Can you imagine how much fun
this is gonna be?

00:24.064 --> 00:25.548
Me living with Troy and Abed?

00:25.582 --> 00:27.466
Yeah, there'll be
a honeymoon phase,

00:27.501 --> 00:30.169
but it won't be long
till you hate their guts.

00:30.203 --> 00:32.238
What's this whittle guy's name?

00:32.272 --> 00:34.907
I'll never hate Troy and Abed.

00:34.941 --> 00:36.976
Oh, my God, I forgot.
You're 20.

00:37.010 --> 00:38.811
Don't worry.
It's natural.

00:38.845 --> 00:40.246
When you become
roommates with friends,

00:40.280 --> 00:42.348
the things you love about
them become the things

00:42.382 --> 00:44.684
that make you want
to smother them with a pillow.

00:44.718 --> 00:47.353
But...
That's unacceptable to me.

00:47.387 --> 00:51.724
Then...I'm lying?

00:54.761 --> 00:55.728
Forgetting something?

00:55.762 --> 00:58.698
Yeah.

01:01.618 --> 01:03.235
Yeah, like I'm gonna
get sick of this.

01:03.270 --> 01:04.703
Wh-what wh-what?

01:04.738 --> 01:06.339
We're here to help you move...

01:06.373 --> 01:07.640
on the dance floor.

01:07.674 --> 01:09.375
- Nice! Tweet it!
- Tweeting it.

01:09.409 --> 01:10.776
- What are you tweeting?
- Everything.

01:10.811 --> 01:12.428
We're live tweeting
Annie's move on Twitter.

01:12.462 --> 01:13.796
Hashtag #Annie'sMove.

01:13.847 --> 01:15.281
How fun.

01:15.315 --> 01:17.416
How was I supposed to know
it was a handicap space?

01:17.451 --> 01:19.852
Because the man in
the wheelchair was yelling it.

01:19.886 --> 01:23.105
Oh, yeah, and he doesn't
have an agenda.

01:23.140 --> 01:25.424
Hold it.

01:25.442 --> 01:27.426
- Where's Winger?
- Sick.

01:27.444 --> 01:28.644
Pshaw!

01:28.695 --> 01:30.596
Yeah, I'm calling him.

01:30.614 --> 01:34.333
Hello?

01:34.368 --> 01:36.152
So you're sick, huh?

01:36.203 --> 01:37.670
That's what they tell me.

01:37.704 --> 01:38.871
Cut the wit, Winger.

01:38.905 --> 01:40.973
Where are you,
The Gap or Banana Republic?

01:41.007 --> 01:43.109
Well, Britta,
you got me all figured out.

01:43.143 --> 01:44.910
Well I can tell
you're not in bed.

01:44.944 --> 01:46.078
That's right, Britta.

01:46.112 --> 01:47.380
I'm pretending
to be violently ill

01:47.414 --> 01:49.215
to avoid lifting a few boxes.

01:49.249 --> 01:50.949
Because I'm 13.

01:50.967 --> 01:53.335
And who's your primary care
physician, Mr. Winger?

01:53.387 --> 01:56.088
Uh, Dr. Schroeder.
S-c-h.

01:56.123 --> 01:57.823
Um, do you want to see
my insurance card?

01:57.858 --> 01:59.291
Please.

01:59.309 --> 02:00.559
Wait, are you at a hospital?

02:00.594 --> 02:03.796
No, I'm at The Gap.

02:03.830 --> 02:04.797
You hear that?

02:04.831 --> 02:06.165
That's not a heart monitor.

02:06.199 --> 02:08.366
It's a machine telling me
I'm low on khakis.

02:08.401 --> 02:12.271
Dr. Tarpenian to radiology,
Dr. Tarpenian.

02:12.305 --> 02:14.323
Crap, I- I'm sorry.
I just assumed--

02:14.357 --> 02:16.075
Whatever.
I don't blame you.

02:16.109 --> 02:17.476
I've lied before.

02:17.494 --> 02:19.278
It's probably karma
that I'm sick.

02:19.312 --> 02:21.414
But believe me,
if you had what I have,

02:21.448 --> 02:23.332
you'd rather be moving boxes.

02:23.366 --> 02:25.167
Okay, feel better.

02:25.202 --> 02:26.318
Sorry.

02:26.353 --> 02:28.654
Yeah, I'll see
you guys on Monday.

02:30.373 --> 02:31.990
You are fantastic.

02:32.008 --> 02:33.292
So are you.

02:33.326 --> 02:34.493
What are you doing after this?

02:34.528 --> 02:37.229
Probably trying
a couple of boot-cuts.

02:37.264 --> 02:38.230
But after that...

02:38.265 --> 02:43.035
Maybe, like, a blazer?

02:43.069 --> 02:47.022
♪ Give me some rope,
time in a tree ♪

02:47.057 --> 02:50.342
♪ give me the hope
to run out of steam ♪

02:50.377 --> 02:53.813
♪ somebody said
we could be here ♪

02:53.847 --> 02:57.733
♪ we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year ♪

02:57.784 --> 03:02.655
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

03:02.689 --> 03:06.692
♪ one by one
they all just fade away ♪

03:11.231 --> 03:13.199
How are we out of packing tape?

03:13.233 --> 03:14.550
I don't know.

03:14.584 --> 03:16.502
I think I left some
in the bathroom.

03:19.773 --> 03:23.709
Nope, uh, nothing in here.

03:23.727 --> 03:25.511
You guys!
You used all of it?

03:25.545 --> 03:28.764
I had a big breakfast.

03:28.815 --> 03:31.951
Nice. Tweeting it!

03:31.985 --> 03:33.252
Okay, there might be
a slight danger

03:33.286 --> 03:34.887
I will end up hating them.

03:34.921 --> 03:36.222
Man children...
Can't live with them,

03:36.256 --> 03:38.057
can't leave them alone
with your tape.

03:38.091 --> 03:40.576
Britta, don't make jokes.
You're bad at it.

03:40.610 --> 03:43.229
Also, I can't afford
to live anywhere else.

03:43.263 --> 03:46.532
And everything is riding
on this, and I'm out of tape--

03:46.566 --> 03:49.702
Annie, listen.
Breathe.

03:49.736 --> 03:50.803
When I was in Amsterdam,

03:50.837 --> 03:52.621
I met this guy
who ate too many shrooms

03:52.672 --> 03:55.140
and fell out of a window
at the Anne Frank house.

03:55.175 --> 03:56.675
Oh, no, no, he's fine.

03:56.710 --> 04:00.262
The doctor said that the drugs
made his body just limp enough

04:00.297 --> 04:01.780
to keep him from
breaking his neck.

04:01.815 --> 04:03.482
Britta, I don't see
what your taste in men

04:03.517 --> 04:04.650
has to do with my situation.

04:04.684 --> 04:06.018
What I'm saying, Annie,

04:06.052 --> 04:08.020
is that if you're gonna live
with two guys like that,

04:08.054 --> 04:10.122
you've gotta learn to go limp.

04:10.156 --> 04:11.607
Loosey-goosey.

04:11.641 --> 04:13.592
Shake it all up.

04:13.610 --> 04:15.477
- Limp...
- Loosey-goosey.

04:15.529 --> 04:18.197
Okay... New Annie.

04:18.231 --> 04:19.899
Going with the flow.

04:19.933 --> 04:22.234
Loosey-goosey-- Is it
loosey-goosey or goosey-loosey?

04:22.269 --> 04:24.102
Is that hyphenated?
You know what?

04:24.120 --> 04:25.621
Don't tell me.

04:25.655 --> 04:27.990
I don't need to know.

04:28.041 --> 04:30.609
Bro...Heim.

04:30.627 --> 04:32.945
Okay, go.

04:32.963 --> 04:34.680
- Aah!
- Didn't feel it.

04:34.714 --> 04:38.584
What... a fun use

04:38.618 --> 04:40.953
you found for my bubble wrap.

04:40.971 --> 04:43.121
I know! We have to
sell this to the military.

04:43.139 --> 04:45.257
Yeah, baby.

04:45.291 --> 04:46.892
Yah, babuh.

04:46.927 --> 04:48.510
Here's the other tape gun.
Think fast!

04:48.562 --> 04:51.363
Ooh!

04:51.398 --> 04:53.532
You broke my pluggy thing.

04:53.567 --> 04:54.817
No worries.

04:54.851 --> 04:57.202
That's what
the security deposit is for.

04:57.237 --> 04:58.470
Hashtag #ThatIsAll.

04:58.488 --> 05:00.689
Oh no, you're not
letting some slumlord

05:00.740 --> 05:01.857
take your hard-earned money.

05:01.908 --> 05:03.359
I'll fix it.

05:03.410 --> 05:04.476
I used to do that
kind of thing all the time

05:04.511 --> 05:06.211
- when I was a slumlord.
- Really, Pierce?

05:06.246 --> 05:07.980
My landlord's coming by
to do the inspection at 5:00.

05:08.014 --> 05:09.315
Do you think you're gonna
have it done by then?

05:09.349 --> 05:11.867
Easy peasy, George and Weezie.

05:11.918 --> 05:13.819
This is probably the last
that'll fit in our car.

05:13.837 --> 05:14.820
I'll help you.

05:14.838 --> 05:17.456
But not in an uptight way.

05:17.490 --> 05:19.491
I'm very concerned about
this living situation.

05:19.526 --> 05:21.093
I mean, I've seen enough
episodes of Friends

05:21.127 --> 05:23.128
to know that cohabitation
leads to sex, drugs

05:23.163 --> 05:25.397
and something a parade magazine
called Schwimmer-fatigue.

05:25.432 --> 05:26.932
Good for you, Shirley.
What's the saying?

05:26.967 --> 05:29.134
If you can't stop 'em,
judge 'em?

05:29.169 --> 05:31.036
Well, somebody's gotta be
this group's moral compass.

05:31.071 --> 05:32.871
And that somebody
has to be you, right?

05:32.906 --> 05:35.808
Because by moral compass,
you mean Shirley's religion.

05:35.842 --> 05:36.859
Well...

05:36.893 --> 05:38.510
Want a ride?

05:38.545 --> 05:40.112
Well, if this is a forecast
of the conversation,

05:40.146 --> 05:41.513
I will ride with somebody else.

05:41.548 --> 05:43.565
Don't worry, Shirley.

05:43.617 --> 05:44.717
Keep me company while I fix this

05:44.751 --> 05:46.118
and I'll give you
a ride over there.

05:48.288 --> 05:51.356
Britta!

05:51.374 --> 05:53.692
Well, hey there, stranger!

05:53.710 --> 05:56.228
What a coincidence, huh?

05:56.262 --> 05:58.664
This is just like that, uh,
Lake House movie.

05:58.698 --> 06:00.933
I can only assume.
Even I have limits.

06:00.967 --> 06:02.701
Dean Pelton.

06:02.719 --> 06:05.804
Jeff, it's Saturday.
Call me Craig.

06:05.839 --> 06:08.424
Off campus,
I'm just a craigular Joe.

06:08.475 --> 06:10.542
Ooh, what'd you get?

06:10.560 --> 06:13.245
Ah, now I feel like I have to
head back out there.

06:13.279 --> 06:14.647
Dean--uh, Craig,

06:14.681 --> 06:16.248
it's nice to see you
but I actually have to run.

06:16.282 --> 06:18.734
Oh, yeah, you're probably
heading to help Annie move.

06:18.768 --> 06:20.903
Right?

06:20.937 --> 06:23.822
Oh, I follow Troy
and Abed on Twitter.

06:23.857 --> 06:26.258
Looks like Annie's moving
and you're...

06:26.292 --> 06:28.027
Sick at the hospital?

06:28.061 --> 06:30.029
Curious.

06:30.063 --> 06:31.296
I might head there myself.

06:31.331 --> 06:32.765
I could tell them you said hi.

06:32.799 --> 06:34.033
I'd rather you didn't.

06:34.067 --> 06:36.669
Well, maybe I won't have time.

06:36.703 --> 06:38.737
Especially if we're doing...

06:38.755 --> 06:40.806
Lunch?

06:46.846 --> 06:50.382
Yeah, but your religion
isn't the same as morality.

06:50.417 --> 06:52.918
And calling me amoral
because I'm atheistic

06:52.952 --> 06:54.420
is religious persecution.

06:54.454 --> 06:55.771
How can I religiously
persecute you?

06:55.805 --> 06:57.356
You don't have a religion.

06:57.390 --> 06:59.725
Oh, look!
A hitchhiker.

06:59.759 --> 07:01.126
A person in need.

07:01.161 --> 07:02.778
Oh, my God.
What am I doing?

07:02.812 --> 07:04.730
I'm pulling over
to help him out.

07:04.764 --> 07:06.065
Do not help him out.

07:06.099 --> 07:07.633
Why, because it
proves the existence

07:07.667 --> 07:09.068
of secular morality?

07:09.102 --> 07:10.669
No, because he looks stinky.

07:10.704 --> 07:16.658
Judge not, Shirley.
Judge not.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.410
I really appreciate it,
thank you.

07:18.444 --> 07:20.212
Where are you headed,
fellow human?

07:20.246 --> 07:21.213
Riverside Falls?

07:21.247 --> 07:22.548
That's 40 minutes away.

07:22.582 --> 07:25.718
Oh, I guess I'm just
a really good person.

07:25.752 --> 07:26.885
I knew you were.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.088
I could see the kindness
in your faces.

07:29.122 --> 07:30.973
I assume you've both
accepted Jesus Christ

07:31.007 --> 07:32.257
as your lord and savior?

07:32.292 --> 07:35.594
Oh, that's nice.

07:38.665 --> 07:40.432
Ow!

07:44.704 --> 07:47.606
Needed a coat of paint anyway.

07:49.308 --> 07:53.078
Welcome, Annie,
to your new home.

07:53.113 --> 07:55.581
Okay...To reacquaint you,
there's the bathroom,

07:55.615 --> 07:58.951
kitchen,
and, of course, our bedroom.

07:58.985 --> 08:00.318
And if the room's a rockin'
please come a knockin'

08:00.336 --> 08:01.670
because there's something
probably terribly wrong.

08:01.704 --> 08:03.338
Yeah, we're pretty chill
in there.

08:03.373 --> 08:05.657
Mm-hmm, now let's go
see your room.

08:09.429 --> 08:10.629
What's that?

08:10.663 --> 08:12.865
That is your room.

08:12.899 --> 08:15.200
You said this was
a two bedroom.

08:15.235 --> 08:17.352
It is, one, two.

08:17.387 --> 08:18.437
Yours is a blanket fort.

08:18.471 --> 08:20.672
An awesome blanket fort.

08:20.707 --> 08:22.274
But still highly flammable
so no candles.

08:22.308 --> 08:24.226
What do you think?

08:24.277 --> 08:26.511
- Tweet it?
- Tweeting it!

08:31.428 --> 08:32.618
I am not surprised
you're so taken aback.

08:32.619 --> 08:34.003
This apartment
is where dreams come true.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.841
We spent our whole lives
being told that blanket forts

08:36.972 --> 08:38.506
are only for special occasions,

08:38.640 --> 08:40.475
like sleepovers
or when uncles die.

08:40.509 --> 08:41.509
But that's a lie, Annie.

08:41.544 --> 08:43.244
You can live
in a fort of blankets

08:43.279 --> 08:45.447
all day, every night.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.749
It's so awesome.

08:47.767 --> 08:49.901
I'm surprised you guys haven't
chosen to live in one.

08:49.935 --> 08:51.386
Well, we'll be spending
enough time in yours.

08:51.420 --> 08:53.455
I mean, it's where
we're gonna watch tv.

08:53.489 --> 08:55.090
Right.

08:58.394 --> 09:00.362
Uh, what's that door
over there?

09:00.396 --> 09:01.463
That's not a bedroom?

09:01.497 --> 09:03.832
- No.
- Oh, no, no, no.

09:03.866 --> 09:04.866
Is it a linen closet?

09:04.900 --> 09:06.634
Something like that.

09:06.669 --> 09:08.636
What's a linen closet?

09:08.671 --> 09:11.306
A siesta salad and an iced tea.

09:11.340 --> 09:14.476
Excelente.
And for you?

09:14.510 --> 09:16.344
Ahem.

09:19.048 --> 09:21.883
- The gentleman...
- Oh...

09:21.917 --> 09:24.118
will have
a top notch-os

09:24.136 --> 09:25.453
and a watermelon Margarita.

09:25.471 --> 09:27.489
Thank you, Jeffrey.

09:27.523 --> 09:29.891
So, any brothers or sisters?

09:29.925 --> 09:30.892
And we'll take the check too.

09:30.926 --> 09:33.461
Oh!
What's the rush?

09:33.496 --> 09:35.830
We're eating lunch,
and then I'm leaving.

09:35.865 --> 09:37.098
Okay.
I just hope that I don't

09:37.132 --> 09:38.900
bump into
your study group on Monday.

09:38.934 --> 09:41.202
And I pray they don't ask me

09:41.237 --> 09:42.971
who I saw at the mall
on Saturday.

09:43.005 --> 09:45.306
Because,
unlike a certain someone,

09:45.341 --> 09:48.243
I just don't think I could lie
to those sweet people.

09:48.277 --> 09:49.978
Dean, this is blackmail.

09:50.012 --> 09:51.913
Ah! Call me Craig.

09:51.947 --> 09:54.616
And call blackmail
"a day at the mall with Craig."

09:54.650 --> 09:57.252
Because that's all
I require, Jeffrey.

09:57.286 --> 09:59.788
You and I are going
to have some fun.

09:59.822 --> 10:01.222
And create a few memories.

10:01.257 --> 10:03.041
And I suggest you get into it.

10:03.092 --> 10:06.494
Because that counts.

10:06.529 --> 10:10.265
A song for the señor, señor?

10:11.801 --> 10:13.401
Adiós amores.

10:13.436 --> 10:18.022
Oh, what a surprise.

10:18.057 --> 10:21.309
Mmm!

10:25.648 --> 10:27.398
Jeez.

10:29.000 --> 10:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:52.475 --> 10:55.810
This is actually
quite calming for some reason.

10:55.845 --> 10:59.214
And that's when I realized
I had to forgive them.

10:59.248 --> 11:00.515
That's a beautiful story.

11:00.549 --> 11:02.600
So inspiring how he came
to find the lord.

11:02.651 --> 11:04.652
- Isn't it, Britta?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:04.687 --> 11:06.254
Well, I didn't exactly have
to find the lord.

11:06.288 --> 11:07.489
He was inside me.

11:07.523 --> 11:09.424
Amen!
What's your name, friend?

11:09.458 --> 11:10.425
- Jesus.
- Oh.

11:10.459 --> 11:11.659
Are you Latino?

11:11.694 --> 11:14.562
No, my child.
I am him.

11:14.597 --> 11:15.563
You're what now?

11:15.598 --> 11:17.165
I am the one true son of God.

11:17.199 --> 11:18.833
I was sent here
to save humanity.

11:18.868 --> 11:20.301
Oh, no.

11:20.336 --> 11:23.087
Well, it is a pleasure
to have you in my car, Jesus.

11:23.122 --> 11:24.906
Britta, stop.
It's not funny now.

11:24.924 --> 11:27.742
Hey Jesus, just curious, what's
your position on marijuana?

11:27.776 --> 11:29.144
It was given to us by God.

11:29.178 --> 11:30.278
It should be legal.

11:30.312 --> 11:33.765
Oh, that's nice.

11:44.927 --> 11:47.128
Hear me, hear me!

11:49.498 --> 11:51.599
Presenting
the real-life fairy tale

11:51.634 --> 11:54.035
of how princess Annie was saved

11:54.069 --> 11:55.703
from bad neighborhood forest

11:55.738 --> 11:57.238
by woodsman Troy.

11:58.774 --> 12:01.276
And Bebad, his emotionally
unavailable unicorn.

12:02.511 --> 12:03.745
Brought to you by

12:03.779 --> 12:06.481
the girl-yogurt
Jamie Lee Curtis uses to poop.

12:06.515 --> 12:08.149
There's
a package of it in the fridge

12:08.184 --> 12:09.484
as a welcoming gift.

12:09.518 --> 12:11.386
Now, once upon a time

12:11.420 --> 12:13.988
there was a beautiful
princess named Annie.

12:14.023 --> 12:15.256
Hi.

12:15.291 --> 12:18.309
Who was harassed every day
by Count Spaghetti.

12:20.229 --> 12:22.513
The evil cracksmith who lived
outside of her building.

12:22.565 --> 12:24.098
Whoa!

12:24.133 --> 12:25.516
I just stand here?

12:25.568 --> 12:27.101
Oh, come on, Jeffrey.

12:27.136 --> 12:29.804
Get in here!

12:29.838 --> 12:31.356
This is gonna be fun!

12:31.407 --> 12:32.740
Or else.

12:32.775 --> 12:34.138
So we just punch in
the numbers?

12:34.139 --> 12:35.081
That's right.

12:35.082 --> 12:37.517
Okay, you know this one, Jeff.

12:37.546 --> 12:40.531
We've sang it a thousand times
together in my mind.

12:41.951 --> 12:44.702
Huh, huh?
Oh come on, Jeffrey.

12:44.753 --> 12:46.854
Make or break time.

12:46.889 --> 12:49.524

back here next Saturday.

a little fun.

14:22.051 --> 14:24.085
Huh, see?

14:24.119 --> 14:25.620
And you emailed your therapist

14:25.654 --> 14:27.588
that you wanted to be
alone this weekend.

14:29.091 --> 14:30.825
What?

14:30.859 --> 14:32.293
Hmm?

14:32.328 --> 14:34.946
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

14:34.980 --> 14:36.564
Now, with your permission,

14:36.598 --> 14:39.100
I'd like to sing a little song
about race-mixing.

14:39.134 --> 14:41.452
This one's called
"Don't You Do It."

14:41.487 --> 14:45.206
Get out!

14:56.418 --> 14:58.119
Ah, good evening, senator.

14:58.153 --> 15:00.655
Any requests?

15:00.689 --> 15:03.725
What do you want to do next?
I paid for a full hour, so--

15:03.759 --> 15:06.527
I email my therapist
from my Greendale account.

15:06.562 --> 15:08.563
The same account
where I received an email

15:08.597 --> 15:11.933
from physique25 telling me
about today's sale.

15:11.967 --> 15:13.534
Is that why you're at the mall?

15:13.569 --> 15:14.936
You read student emails?

15:14.970 --> 15:16.971
Oh, oh, now the patriot act

15:17.005 --> 15:18.906
says I can do it, Jeffrey...
Technically.

15:18.941 --> 15:22.026
Need I remind you
the nation is at war-- Ow!

15:22.077 --> 15:23.644
- I'll kill you.
- No, Jeffrey, no!

15:23.662 --> 15:24.779
Jeffrey, Jeffrey come on!

15:24.813 --> 15:27.048
Just remember,
we were making memories!

15:27.082 --> 15:28.716
No, Jeffrey, no!

15:28.751 --> 15:30.218
Aah!

15:30.252 --> 15:32.186
No, Jeffrey!
No, no, it's too violent!

15:32.221 --> 15:34.672
You're scaring me!
Don't let the terrorists win!

15:36.498 --> 15:41.498
And then the three of them lived
happily ever after!

15:42.386 --> 15:43.887
And Bebad became
the little dipper.

15:45.590 --> 15:46.790
The end.

15:46.825 --> 15:51.779
- Kiss me, woodsman Troy!
- Mwah!

15:51.830 --> 15:53.330
You guys!

15:53.364 --> 15:55.532
Living here is gonna be
fun all the time.

15:55.566 --> 15:57.735
Let's make
the entire apartment a fort.

15:57.769 --> 15:59.753
I'll get more blankets.

16:13.017 --> 16:15.418
This is a space we reserved
for virtual adventures.

16:15.437 --> 16:17.588
Like a playroom but
only works in our minds.

16:17.622 --> 16:20.724
We call it the dreamatorium.

16:20.759 --> 16:23.660
But...it's a bedroom.

16:23.695 --> 16:25.462
No, no.
There's only two bedrooms,

16:25.497 --> 16:26.897
including the blanket fort.

16:26.931 --> 16:28.649
This is the...

16:28.700 --> 16:31.401
Dreamatorium.

16:31.435 --> 16:33.570
All day, I've been

16:33.604 --> 16:35.205
jumping through hoops
to fit in.

16:35.240 --> 16:36.406
Including the literal hoops

16:36.441 --> 16:37.825
you put in front of the toilet.

16:37.876 --> 16:39.343
- Yes.
- And you guys are hoarding

16:39.377 --> 16:42.379
this second bedroom
as some kind of playroom?

16:42.413 --> 16:44.581
And making me sleep
on a pile of laundry?

16:44.616 --> 16:46.850
Hey, we worked hard on that.
And it's a blanket fort.

16:46.885 --> 16:50.354
It's an asylum
for half-witted children!

16:50.388 --> 16:53.090
As the only adult
in this apartment,

16:53.124 --> 16:54.992
I am making an ultimatum.

16:55.026 --> 16:57.794
Me or this...
Stupid dreamatorium.

16:57.812 --> 16:59.513
Dreamatorium is non-negotiable.
Read the lease.

16:59.564 --> 17:00.998
Especially the part
we added in crayon.

17:01.032 --> 17:02.266
You don't wanna
take this to court.

17:02.300 --> 17:03.567
Trust us, this place
can be a courtroom

17:03.601 --> 17:05.135
in the blink of an eye.

17:05.170 --> 17:07.771
This doesn't work for me.

17:07.805 --> 17:09.272
From the minute
I joined the study group

17:09.307 --> 17:11.141
I've been worried
about how uptight I am

17:11.175 --> 17:12.976
and how I'm no fun.

17:13.011 --> 17:14.545
And then I was worried
that I wouldn't fit in here

17:14.579 --> 17:15.979
or be able to hang
with you guys.

17:15.997 --> 17:17.414
But you know what?

17:17.448 --> 17:18.848
Why don't you ever ask
yourselves whether

17:18.883 --> 17:20.349
you can hang with me?

17:20.385 --> 17:21.952
Why am I always the one
that has to adapt?

17:21.986 --> 17:23.720
I'm sick of this crap!

17:23.755 --> 17:27.140
Enjoy your stupid dreamatorium.

17:27.192 --> 17:28.758
We will!

17:28.776 --> 17:30.661
Because this is
our apartment too!

17:30.695 --> 17:32.279
And just because we're awesome

17:32.313 --> 17:34.464
doesn't mean we're not adults!

17:37.402 --> 17:38.836
Candy cigarette?

17:38.870 --> 17:40.170
I don't want a candy cigarette.

17:40.205 --> 17:43.773
- I want our Annie.
- Yeah, we blew it.

17:43.791 --> 17:46.844
I picked the wrong week
to quit.

17:51.216 --> 17:53.050
What the hell is this?

17:53.084 --> 17:55.352
In security deposit terms,
it's a gold mine.

17:55.386 --> 17:57.287
And you're lucky it's only
gonna cost you money.

17:57.322 --> 17:59.806
Your friend nearly
killed himself.

17:59.841 --> 18:01.558
Yeah, that's me.

18:01.593 --> 18:04.161
Lucky Annie.

18:04.195 --> 18:06.496
I'm really sorry, Annie.

18:06.531 --> 18:07.965
I had some island girls over

18:07.999 --> 18:09.633
and one of them must have
slipped me a Mickey.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.902
I'm just glad you're okay.

18:11.936 --> 18:14.504
You can pay me back
by helping me

18:14.539 --> 18:16.473
get all my stuff
from Troy and Abed's.

18:16.507 --> 18:20.510
You're moving again?
How long was I out?

18:20.528 --> 18:22.179
Is napster still a thing?

18:22.213 --> 18:25.015
You've been out long enough
for me to realize

18:25.049 --> 18:28.018
that I'm gonna need
to keep living alone.

18:28.036 --> 18:29.620
Come on.

18:29.654 --> 18:32.072
Let's get you cleaned up.

18:32.123 --> 18:33.590
Oh, what the hell?

18:33.625 --> 18:35.692
I have brain damage.
Nothing I do counts.

18:40.698 --> 18:43.133
Where is all my stuff?

18:43.167 --> 18:45.168
Troy, Abed?

18:50.642 --> 18:53.594
It's all yours.

18:53.645 --> 18:55.178
We're sorry.

18:55.213 --> 18:57.014
Sometimes we get stuck
in our own little world.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.283
And then in that world,
we make even littler worlds.

18:59.317 --> 19:01.652
And sometimes there are
tunnels between those worlds.

19:01.686 --> 19:03.921
Or a subway.
One time a snake.

19:03.955 --> 19:05.989
We're sorry.
Do you like it?

19:06.024 --> 19:10.160
Of course, I do.
It's perfect.

19:10.194 --> 19:11.578
I mean, I can rearrange
the throw pillows.

19:11.613 --> 19:13.230
You have them arranged
by size instead of color, but--

19:13.264 --> 19:14.932
What did I say?

19:14.966 --> 19:16.400
But what about
the dreamatorium?

19:16.434 --> 19:17.701
Oh, it's staying.

19:17.735 --> 19:19.002
The dreamatorium is more
important than any of us.

19:19.037 --> 19:20.304
But you're more important
than our bedroom,

19:20.338 --> 19:21.705
so we put the bunk bed
in the blanket fort.

19:21.739 --> 19:23.173
This is all gay code.

19:23.207 --> 19:25.075
You sure I'm worth it?

19:25.109 --> 19:26.276
Yeah, there's a couple of
things that we were hoping

19:26.311 --> 19:27.711
that you'd help us with.

19:27.745 --> 19:28.946
Yes, like where does
the water go in the iron?

19:28.980 --> 19:30.013
And what's the iron for?

19:30.048 --> 19:31.348
And what
gets out kool-aid stains?

19:31.382 --> 19:32.649
Yeah, we already know
that the opposite

19:32.684 --> 19:34.184
color kool-aid
doesn't work.

19:34.218 --> 19:36.687
Also, Troy scraped me when
we were fork-jousting last week

19:36.721 --> 19:37.804
and I don't think
it's healing right.

19:37.855 --> 19:39.122
- Oh, Abed, that's infected.
- Ew!

19:39.157 --> 19:40.857
Infected. That's the word
I was looking for.

19:40.892 --> 19:43.694
- Hi, guys.
- I thought you were sick.

19:43.728 --> 19:45.896
I was...n't.

19:45.930 --> 19:47.464
I kind of made it up
to get out of helping.

19:47.498 --> 19:48.932
Oh, that's okay.

19:48.967 --> 19:51.034
- It is?
- Yeah, it is.

19:51.069 --> 19:53.804
Oh, hey, Jeff, did you
know that when it snows

19:53.838 --> 19:55.238
my eyes become large?

19:55.273 --> 19:58.909
♪ and the light that
you shine can be seen ♪

19:58.943 --> 20:00.410
He tweeted it?

20:00.445 --> 20:03.947
- ♪ baby ♪
- He tweeted it!

20:03.982 --> 20:07.617
♪ A kiss from a Rose
on the grave ♪

20:07.652 --> 20:11.471
♪ and now that your Rose
is in bloom ♪

20:11.506 --> 20:16.693
♪ a light hits the gloom
on the grave ♪

20:24.421 --> 20:26.189
- Oh, look out, asteroids!
- That was close.

20:26.223 --> 20:27.490
Thanks for getting us
to planet Greendalia

20:27.524 --> 20:29.108
safely, horsebot 3000.

20:29.159 --> 20:30.576
- Well--
- Oh, no!

20:30.611 --> 20:33.429
Greendalia has been overrun
by evil King Blorgon!

20:33.463 --> 20:35.665
- Look out, Troyborg!
- Pew pew pew!

20:35.699 --> 20:37.066
Ah! I'm dead.

20:37.084 --> 20:39.335
Horsebot 3000, no!
I love you!

20:39.369 --> 20:40.903
I am King Blorgon.

20:40.938 --> 20:43.172
And my plan is
to blow up the world!

20:43.207 --> 20:45.942
Your lasers are
useless against me.

20:45.976 --> 20:47.510
Aim for his butt.
It's his only weakness.

20:47.544 --> 20:48.511
- Pew pew!
- Bam bam!

20:48.545 --> 20:50.179
- Aah!
- We did it!

20:50.214 --> 20:53.299
Peace and tranquility have
been restored to Greendalia.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.917
And all thanks
to horsebot 3000.

20:54.952 --> 20:56.602
He belongs to the stars now.

20:58.222 --> 20:59.422
All right, five more minutes

20:59.456 --> 21:02.124
and we should probably
put a stop to this, right?

21:02.159 --> 21:04.293
Jeff, are you--

21:04.328 --> 21:06.329
I liked horsebot 3000.

21:06.877 --> 21:08.511
