00:01.430 --> 00:02.580
<i> Attention, students</i>.

00:02.580 --> 00:05.700
<i>We have now docked in Hawaii</i>,
<i>home of sugar cane, pineapple</i>,

00:05.700 --> 00:08.500
<i>and your cruise director'</i> s
<i>favorite, Kona coffee</i>.

00:08.820 --> 00:11.950
<i>Finely ground, the two pound bag</i>,
<i>let's not be cheap</i>.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.460
Unbelievable.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.260
We're stuck on this
stupid boat for five days

00:16.260 --> 00:18.340
and now we can't leave
this stupid boat because you

00:18.414 --> 00:20.140
can't find
your stupid lip gloss!

00:20.580 --> 00:21.740
lt is not stupid.

00:21.740 --> 00:23.980
lt has SPF 30,
the healing power of aloe

00:23.980 --> 00:27.100
and it tastes like coconut!
l like coconut.

00:27.890 --> 00:29.180
Here's just an idea...

00:29.340 --> 00:32.900
We just docked in Hawaii,
buy a coconut!

00:33.420 --> 00:35.210
Oh, like you never forget anything.

00:35.340 --> 00:37.020
l don't. l'm a professional.

00:37.072 --> 00:38.500
l have a checklist.

00:38.834 --> 00:40.540
Wig, got it.

00:40.836 --> 00:42.780
Single pink glove, got it.

00:42.940 --> 00:44.260
Mama's lucky anklet...

00:45.380 --> 00:46.500
Don't got it.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.340
Where's my lucky anklet?

00:48.420 --> 00:51.340
Oh, well, maybe little miss
''l'm a professional''

00:51.340 --> 00:53.260
forgot to put it on
because she was too busy

00:53.260 --> 00:55.780
insulting her best friend.
Oh, sweet justice.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.220
Lilly, it's gotta be
in here someplace

00:58.220 --> 01:00.900
- and l'm not gonna stop searching...
- Found it!

01:00.955 --> 01:03.120
Oh, Lilly, you're a life saver.

01:05.620 --> 01:09.260
Oh. You thought l meant the anklet.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.470
Mm. Coconut goodness.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.660
Lilly, you know my mom
gave me that anklet.

01:14.660 --> 01:17.500
- We gotta find it!
- Right. Sorry. l'm on it.

01:19.660 --> 01:21.020
lt's like a lucky charm.

01:21.140 --> 01:23.080
Like she's right there
on stage with me.

01:24.060 --> 01:26.540
- Moseby here.
- Oh! Come in.

01:26.980 --> 01:29.140
Ah. Miss Montana,
l've cleared the hallway

01:29.140 --> 01:31.460
and the helicopter is waiting
to take you to your rehearsal.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.860
Thanks, Mr. Moseby.
Just give me a few minutes.

01:33.860 --> 01:35.900
Just a few... No, no, no, no...

01:36.540 --> 01:39.260
l hate to rush you,
but the wind from the helicopter

01:39.260 --> 01:42.780
is wreaking havoc on
the senior citizens' hula dancing class.

01:42.780 --> 01:45.380
Grass skirts are flying everywhere.
lt's not pretty.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.500
Lilly, we have to find it.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.140
l know it's important,
but we'll find it when we get back.

01:52.408 --> 01:55.500
l know. lt just doesn't feel right
not having it on.

01:55.620 --> 01:57.100
Miley, it's gonna be OK.

01:57.148 --> 02:00.140
lt's just a rehearsal.
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.640
That was the worst rehearsal ever!

02:03.640 --> 02:05.100
lt wasn't that terrible.

02:05.580 --> 02:07.180
The lighting guy booed.

02:07.857 --> 02:10.180
Maybe he was calling over
to the sound guy,

02:10.249 --> 02:11.980
whose name happened to be Boo.

02:11.980 --> 02:13.380
You know, like, uh...

02:13.380 --> 02:14.740
''Hey, Boo!''

02:15.060 --> 02:16.680
''Boo!''

02:17.780 --> 02:22.580
Well, unless Boo's last name
is You Stink, don't think so.

02:22.660 --> 02:24.580
Lilly, come on, let's face it.

02:24.780 --> 02:26.910
Everything went wrong
because l don't have Mom's anklet.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.100
First, we know
the anklet's in this room,

02:29.100 --> 02:30.100
so we're going to find it.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.140
Maybe it's in the bathroom.

02:31.180 --> 02:34.620
And second, the rehearsal
probably went bad because

02:34.620 --> 02:37.700
you knew you didn't have the anklet
and so you were nervous.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.500
lt's not like it has magical powers

02:39.500 --> 02:41.860
and now you're doomed
to a life of terrible things happening.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.460
<i>Attention passengers</i>,
<i>a student's pet ra</i> t

02:44.460 --> 02:46.740

<i>/f you happen to see him</i>,

03:53.100 --> 03:55.100
Miley, we've searched
everywhere and all we found

03:55.100 --> 03:57.000
is rat footprints in my makeup.

03:57.148 --> 03:59.660
So gross and yet so cute.

03:59.980 --> 04:02.020
Well, it's not in the drain.

04:05.220 --> 04:07.860
But l think Hagrid
had this room before us.

04:09.460 --> 04:12.180
The anklet has got to be
in here someplace.

04:12.620 --> 04:15.340
See, l was doing my toenails
last night and it was on.

04:15.460 --> 04:18.980
Then l walked over here
to get a bottle of water,

04:18.980 --> 04:21.079
but somebody had drank them all.

04:21.579 --> 04:24.260
Because ''lt's free, it's free.''

04:25.980 --> 04:29.380
My mom says hydrated skin
is happy skin.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.340
Thanks to you,

04:30.340 --> 04:33.160
my skin wouldn't know,
glug-glug girl.

04:33.780 --> 04:36.980
See, and then, l went to
my dad's room to get some water.

04:37.035 --> 04:39.820
l remember 'cause I had to do
my freshly-painted toenail walk.

04:40.940 --> 04:43.880
Then, l got a bottle from him,
and l came right back here.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.640
So, l never even left the room.

04:49.660 --> 04:53.860
Not having Mom's anklet not only
makes me unlucky, it makes me...

04:53.860 --> 04:56.220
Dumb? Stupid? ldiotic?

04:56.220 --> 04:58.150
l was going to say ''forgetful.''

04:58.460 --> 05:00.020
That was my next one.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.410
Oh, hi, um...

05:04.500 --> 05:06.020
l'm sorry about the room.

05:06.020 --> 05:09.220
l'm kind of a restless sleeper.

05:14.140 --> 05:17.180
lt's like Mick Jagger all over again.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.690
Oh, man.

05:20.780 --> 05:22.750
Oh, man!

05:23.620 --> 05:26.180
- Dad!
- Oh! l'm ready! l'm ready!

05:26.300 --> 05:28.030
Time to get to that rehearsal.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.860
Daddy, the rehearsal
was an hour ago.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.540
Was l there?

05:35.540 --> 05:37.870
Dad, have you seen Mom's anklet?

05:38.020 --> 05:41.680
Honey, l'm so seasick
l can't see the inside of my eyelids.

05:42.260 --> 05:46.140
''Let's take a cruise,
Daddy, it'll be fun.''

05:46.580 --> 05:49.020
Oh, sweet niblets, here it comes.

05:52.020 --> 05:54.500
lt's not in my room,
so it has to be in here.

05:56.780 --> 05:57.820
Lilly?

05:59.980 --> 06:00.900
Can you please help me?

06:00.900 --> 06:03.420
l gotta find it before
something else bad happens.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.380
Oh, come on!

06:07.860 --> 06:11.920
Well, on the plus side, now it matches
that one glove thing you're doing.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.420
Super.

06:14.260 --> 06:17.130
Hey, honey.
Did you check your socks?

06:17.260 --> 06:19.590
That's it! l slept in
my socks last night!

06:19.590 --> 06:21.460
l bet it came off
in one of my socks!

06:21.460 --> 06:24.020
- Daddy, thank you.
- Oh!

06:24.020 --> 06:27.260
Oh! lf you didn't smell so funky,
l'd kiss you.

06:31.660 --> 06:33.380
- lt's in my sock.
- ln the sheets.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.220
- ln a pile.
- On the floor.

06:35.289 --> 06:36.820
Once l get it on again...

06:36.820 --> 06:38.300
No more bad luck any...

06:40.380 --> 06:41.780
Oh, come on!

06:46.635 --> 06:49.100
l didn't know why you didn't
want to go to Hawaii.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.700
But now l get it.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.540
- This is paradise.
- Tell me about it.

06:54.540 --> 06:56.900
l haven't washed a dish
in five days.

06:56.900 --> 06:57.660
Sweet.

06:57.660 --> 07:00.410
Haven't eaten
a sensible meal in three.

07:00.410 --> 07:02.460
- Oh, man.
- And the best part is,

07:02.540 --> 07:05.620
haven't held in <i>le ga</i> s
since they left.

07:05.940 --> 07:08.310
Yeah. That one
l figured out on my own.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.460
One second!

07:11.780 --> 07:12.980
Oh! Can l do it?

07:13.700 --> 07:15.660
- Be my guest.
- Yeah.

07:20.660 --> 07:22.832
- Oh!
- That never gets old.

07:24.980 --> 07:26.460
Let me guess, guys.

07:26.460 --> 07:27.780
Parents out of town?

07:28.300 --> 07:29.620
Oh, yeah.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.260
So cool. Sign here.

07:32.481 --> 07:33.900
Excuse me.

07:34.940 --> 07:36.620
Drop this bad boy right here.

07:36.620 --> 07:38.500
- Yeah, that's perfect.
- All right.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.020
- Thanks, man.
- Check you guys later.

07:40.066 --> 07:41.020
Thanks, man.

07:42.260 --> 07:44.780
Whoa! Dude, your dad
ordered something from that

07:44.780 --> 07:46.980
Schlummacker Hummacker
Cool Stuff catalogue.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.380
l love that catalogue.

07:48.440 --> 07:52.900
Massage chairs, life-sized robots,
personal submarines!

07:52.900 --> 07:56.340
And it has the best digital
meat thermometer in the world.

07:57.706 --> 07:58.620
What?

07:59.500 --> 08:01.870
lt takes the guesswork out of grilling.

08:04.620 --> 08:05.860
Hey, Dad.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.700
You got a package from
Schlummacker Hummacker.

08:08.700 --> 08:09.900
l'm gonna open it, OK?

08:11.020 --> 08:13.580
Well, why not?

08:14.140 --> 08:15.780
'Cause l'm the one who ordered it

08:15.780 --> 08:17.300
and l want to be
the one to open it.

08:17.780 --> 08:20.140
- lt's a robot, isn't it?
- lt's a robot?

08:20.340 --> 08:22.860
Jackson, l'm not playing
guessing games.

08:23.340 --> 08:25.860
That package better be sealed
when l get home.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.380
OK, fine.

08:38.860 --> 08:41.274
Jackson, what about what your dad said?

08:41.539 --> 08:42.299
What?

08:42.460 --> 08:45.400
He said he wanted it sealed
when he gets home.

08:45.540 --> 08:47.340
Well, it will be.

08:55.931 --> 08:57.899
Nothing. What about you?

08:59.301 --> 09:00.180
Yeah, me neither.

09:00.275 --> 09:03.700
But l did find 75 cents and a half eaten
raspberry almond chocolate.

09:03.900 --> 09:05.620
How'd you know it's raspberry almond?

09:06.220 --> 09:07.420
Lucky guess.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.575
Ah, yes.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.140
Thank you, Lydia.

09:14.140 --> 09:16.700
l'll put this anklet
in the lost and found.

09:16.700 --> 09:19.540
And as a reward for your sharp eyes,

09:19.613 --> 09:22.100
the <i>S.S. Tipto</i> n
is proud to present you with...

09:22.100 --> 09:25.380
Oh-ho! ...a raspberry almond
pillow chocolate.

09:26.460 --> 09:30.180
Eat it with pride,
but on your own time.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.740
Ooh! Pretty, sparkly, shiny.
Give me. Give me. Give me.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.900
l'm sorry, Miss Tipton,
l didn't find this in your room.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.060
l found it in a passenger's sock.

09:40.060 --> 09:43.140
Hello. My boat, my passengers,
my shiny thing.

09:43.140 --> 09:46.140
- Thank you.
- Oh! OK, London.

09:46.140 --> 09:47.420
Oh, all right.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.980
l'll hold it for safekeeping

09:48.980 --> 09:51.700
till the owner shows with
a receipt and two forms of lD.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.700
lt looks like a storm's coming.

09:55.780 --> 09:57.580
Moseby, make it go away.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.860
Oh, of course.

09:58.860 --> 10:02.700
As soon as l put an iron-on patch
on that hole in the ozone layer.

10:02.795 --> 10:05.020
Hello! l thought we went over this.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.460
Me first, humanity second.

10:08.660 --> 10:10.700
D-R-E-A-M.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.340
Who's Dr. Eam?

10:15.220 --> 10:17.260
Miley, look!
London's got your anklet.

10:18.340 --> 10:21.420
Hey, and she's got great skin.
She must drink a lot of...

10:21.420 --> 10:22.460
Who cares?

10:22.860 --> 10:24.300
Now keep your head down.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.940
The last thing we need
is to be recognized.

10:28.460 --> 10:29.780
Hey, Han...

10:31.820 --> 10:34.700
Sorry. But l cannot be mobbed
right now.

10:35.063 --> 10:36.428
No, l get it.

10:36.465 --> 10:38.330
You wanna spend
a little one on one time

10:38.367 --> 10:40.096
with Old ZackDonald.

10:40.135 --> 10:43.571
Here a kiss, there a kiss,
everywhere a kiss kiss.

10:44.673 --> 10:47.039
lt's the other one
that's got the girlfriend, right?

10:47.075 --> 10:49.305
For her sake, l hope so.

10:50.178 --> 10:53.045
So, let's say
l go to the dessert buffet

10:53.081 --> 10:56.346
and bring us back
a little strawberry ''shirt'' cake.

10:58.020 --> 11:00.250
See what l did there? 

11:00.288 --> 11:02.740
Zack, you always leave me, uh...

11:02.991 --> 11:04.390
...speechless.

11:04.426 --> 11:06.660
Well, l do have that effect
on the ladies.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.220
So, l'll be right back
and don't worry,

11:09.564 --> 11:12.556
l'll bring back a little dessert
for Highlighter Head.

11:15.980 --> 11:19.430
l'm starting to miss those five days
we were stuck in our room.

11:22.580 --> 11:25.220
 lt looks like gold.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.780
But just to be sure...

11:28.350 --> 11:30.380
Eighteen karat...

11:30.380 --> 11:32.260
...with a hint of sock fuzzies.

11:32.260 --> 11:34.820
London, hi.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.700
Hannah! l knew it!

11:36.700 --> 11:38.550
You thought about it
and realized

11:38.550 --> 11:40.940
the <i>Yay M</i> e theme song
is your next number one hit!

11:41.020 --> 11:44.220
<i>London Tipton's really grea</i> t
<i>Really great, really grea</i> t

11:45.380 --> 11:47.610
What is in the water on this boat?

11:47.610 --> 11:50.860
l don't know, but l hope there's a cure.
l must've had 60 bottles.

11:51.260 --> 11:52.380
London?

11:55.620 --> 11:56.640
That's my anklet.

11:56.860 --> 11:58.380
No, it's called <i>Yay Me</i>.

11:58.380 --> 12:02.220
<i>My Ankle</i> t would be a stupid title
since l never say it in the song.

12:05.540 --> 12:08.500
Yeah, um, London, what l meant was...

12:08.660 --> 12:10.650
- ...that anklet...
- Mm-hm.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.940
...belongs to me.

12:13.580 --> 12:16.710
Fine. l'll need to see a receipt
and two forms of lD.

12:17.020 --> 12:19.500
London, l don't have a receipt!

12:19.620 --> 12:22.860
My mom gave that to me
before my very first concert

12:23.140 --> 12:25.230
and l've worn it every show.

12:26.740 --> 12:28.540
lt's my most special possession.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.440
- The diamonds are fake.
- Ew!

12:32.540 --> 12:33.670
 No!

12:33.670 --> 12:37.280
What are you so upset about?
l'm the one who had to touch it.

12:47.362 --> 12:48.380
Are you OK?

12:48.464 --> 12:52.450
No. Now there's nothing
l can do about it.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.780
Unless you're willing to dive in?

12:56.780 --> 12:58.740
Miley, it's gotta be like 60 feet!

12:58.740 --> 13:00.300
Right. Right.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.640
You wouldn't have to get me
anything for my birthday.

13:03.740 --> 13:04.870
- Miley.
- Ever.

13:04.870 --> 13:06.370
- Miley!
- Fine.

13:08.380 --> 13:10.740
- l'm really sorry.
- Thank you.

13:13.980 --> 13:16.100
You know,
we should probably get in.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.140
lt looks like that storm's
getting closer.

13:18.140 --> 13:19.120
Who cares?

13:19.272 --> 13:21.460
What can a stupid storm
do to me now?

13:24.220 --> 13:25.820
OK, seriously...

13:25.820 --> 13:27.540
Come on!

13:33.260 --> 13:35.390
They were out of
strawberry ''shirt'' cake,

13:35.390 --> 13:38.260
but l've got pudding!

13:38.344 --> 13:39.940
Sorry. l don't like chocolate.

13:39.940 --> 13:41.800
Oh, no worries.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.780
l got vanilla in this pocket,
tapioca in this pocket.

13:45.780 --> 13:49.200
And napkins in the back.

13:53.020 --> 13:54.420
Where'd you go?

13:56.220 --> 13:57.590
Yeah.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.380
Yeah, l'm thinking it could work.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.060
ln what world?

14:04.168 --> 14:05.580
Let's face it, Lilly.

14:05.980 --> 14:09.320
Ever since l lost my mom's anklet,
nothing's gone right.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.560
lt's like l'm not meant
to do the concert.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.140
Oh, look.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.220
l know how tough
this has been on you.

14:16.220 --> 14:19.140
And that's why l'm telling you this
as your best friend:

14:19.260 --> 14:21.580
You're Hannah Montana!
Snap out of it!

14:21.580 --> 14:24.460
You've never let your fans down
and you're not gonna do it now!

14:24.460 --> 14:26.780
That wig has got to come off
some day, sister.

14:26.780 --> 14:28.460
And that day is today!

14:28.460 --> 14:31.380
lt's time for Miley Stewart
to show this world what she's got!

14:31.380 --> 14:35.260
Let's rock this island paradise! Whoo!

14:37.380 --> 14:38.900
Or l could get some hair dye.

14:39.140 --> 14:40.700
l'm gonna go with the hair dye.

14:41.260 --> 14:43.420
- But l did like the speech.
- Not enough to do it.

14:43.420 --> 14:46.310
- Lilly.
- l'll go get the dye.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.290
Stupid steam, it's not doing anything.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.420
Are you kidding?
Dude, look at your hair!

15:02.780 --> 15:05.500
l wouldn't talk, Napoleon Dynamite.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.100
Oh, man!

15:08.192 --> 15:10.540
Dude, this isn't working.

15:10.980 --> 15:13.450
l was hoping l wouldn't
have to resort to this, but...

15:13.660 --> 15:15.290
...l think we need a professional.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.160
So you think you can do it?

15:43.340 --> 15:45.140
Blindfolded, in my sleep,

15:45.140 --> 15:46.760
with my tongue.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.970
But my price, unlike your combined lQs,

15:51.140 --> 15:53.820
- is high.
- How much?

15:53.940 --> 15:55.860
lf it's a big robot,
l get to play with it first!

15:55.860 --> 15:57.620
- Pfft!
- Deal.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.620
You promised if it was a robot
l could play with it first.

16:00.620 --> 16:02.880
Do you want it open or not?

16:04.740 --> 16:06.820
l want it open.

16:18.260 --> 16:21.860
This better be one of those
''wait for it'' moments.

16:26.380 --> 16:27.740
Good call.

16:27.740 --> 16:28.720
What is it?

16:29.060 --> 16:30.740
Well, it's not a robot.

16:32.180 --> 16:33.740
What's that beeping?

16:47.836 --> 16:50.202
Can either of you guys
reach my phone?

16:50.238 --> 16:51.660
No!

16:52.260 --> 16:55.530
Fine. l think l can hit
the speaker button.

16:57.545 --> 16:58.900
Hello?

16:59.220 --> 17:01.574
Hey, how's it going?

17:01.616 --> 17:04.619
- Good, good...
- Everything's good.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.420
So, you guys, uh...

17:06.740 --> 17:10.300
...pinned against the floor
or smushed up against the window?

17:10.660 --> 17:12.500
The window.

17:12.940 --> 17:15.339
Uh-huh. So, Jackson...

17:15.448 --> 17:18.660
...next time l get a package,
what ya gonna do?

17:18.859 --> 17:20.740
Not open it?

17:20.900 --> 17:22.500
That's my boy.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.060
Hey, don't worry about it.

17:25.192 --> 17:27.900
<i>The deflate butto</i> n
<i>is right there beside the..</i>.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.938
Dad? Dad!

17:36.140 --> 17:39.387
That's the most fun l've had
this whole darn cruise.

17:40.940 --> 17:42.020
No!

17:42.020 --> 17:44.300
We're never gonna get out of here!

17:45.180 --> 17:47.740
Wait. l think l can pop it
with my fingernail.

17:47.740 --> 17:50.350
Yeah. Yeah. Give it the fingernail.

17:58.060 --> 17:59.420
Thank you.

17:59.420 --> 18:01.460
That was the longest 15 minutes ever.

18:01.676 --> 18:04.509
Fifteen? l thought you said
the dye stays on for 50?

18:09.380 --> 18:10.780
Oh, no!

18:11.180 --> 18:12.540
Maybe it'll dry blonde?

18:12.540 --> 18:14.380
And then what, fall out?

18:14.464 --> 18:16.080
Lilly, how many more signs do l need?

18:19.260 --> 18:21.100
l had to ask.

18:24.499 --> 18:27.980
l mean, Cody, are you sure we should
bother her before the concert?

18:27.980 --> 18:31.780
Please, Bailey, we already have
tickets and backstage passes.

18:31.888 --> 18:35.540
These puppies will get us into
some really cool after-party.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.340
Hey, Hannah, babe.

18:38.340 --> 18:40.940
A little thank you
for those concert tickets.

18:41.860 --> 18:45.284
There is no concert. l'm sorry.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.340
What?

18:46.780 --> 18:49.380
ls this going to affect
the after-party?

18:50.980 --> 18:53.580
OK, Bailey, l know
how disappointed you are...

18:53.580 --> 18:55.020
No, l'm not.

18:55.020 --> 18:58.100
lt's a little like the year
everyone forgot my birthday

18:58.256 --> 18:59.900
and l was so sad
l went and slept in the barn

18:59.900 --> 19:02.060
until a goat started eating my hair.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.601
But l'm not disappointed.

19:09.700 --> 19:10.660
Hey, Bud.

19:11.579 --> 19:12.540
Dad...

19:14.100 --> 19:15.660
l can't do the concert.

19:16.184 --> 19:17.180
l know.

19:17.900 --> 19:20.070
Lilly told me about your mama's anklet.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.860
Ever since l lost it,
nothing's gone right.

19:24.140 --> 19:26.500
l had the worst rehearsal ever.

19:26.700 --> 19:29.100
l missed steps, l sang flat...

19:29.224 --> 19:30.680
...forgot words.

19:32.460 --> 19:34.950
Honey, now that stuff
happens to every rock star.

19:34.980 --> 19:35.980
Oh, really?

19:36.260 --> 19:38.780
Does every rock star end up
with a torn up hotel room,

19:38.780 --> 19:43.340
a broken mirror, green hair
and a rat on their head?

19:44.260 --> 19:47.940
That'd be considered a slow night
on an Ozzy Osbourne tour.

19:49.117 --> 19:51.500
Dad, you don't get it.

19:51.660 --> 19:52.690
Just...

19:53.780 --> 19:56.220
...without Mom up there
on stage with me...

19:57.300 --> 19:58.700
...l'm gonna blow it.

19:58.980 --> 20:02.500
l know what you mean.
l used to worry about the same thing.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.480
Raising you kids without her.

20:05.540 --> 20:06.780
But l did it.

20:07.260 --> 20:08.260
You know how?

20:09.220 --> 20:11.780
'Cause she was with me
every step of the way.

20:12.460 --> 20:13.700
Right in here.

20:15.260 --> 20:17.020
And anklet or no anklet,

20:17.140 --> 20:18.620
it's the same thing for you.

20:19.100 --> 20:22.040
She's with you, right there.

20:23.060 --> 20:25.420
- You really think so?
- l know so.

20:25.504 --> 20:29.050
Who do you think always reminded me
to bring the back-up wig?

20:33.220 --> 20:35.790
Huh. Look at that.

20:36.220 --> 20:39.660
Turning out to be a beautiful day
for a concert in Hawaii.

20:50.311 --> 20:52.620
Hey! What are you guys
sitting around here for?

20:52.620 --> 20:55.620
Don't you have tickets to my concert?
And the after-party?

20:55.620 --> 20:56.660
Let's go.

20:57.719 --> 20:58.540
Yes!

20:58.540 --> 21:00.620
Oh, my gosh, Cody, did you do this?

21:00.620 --> 21:02.100
Bailey, look...

21:02.100 --> 21:04.460
...if this relationship
doesn't have honesty,

21:04.460 --> 21:06.020
it doesn't have anything.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.780
Yes. Yes, l did.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.600
Let's rock, Hawaii!

21:32.740 --> 21:35.020
Take one.
Third camera, mark.

21:35.020 --> 21:37.380
That wig has got to come off
some day, sister.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.100
And that day is today!

21:39.100 --> 21:41.900
lt's time for Miley Stewart
to show this world what she's got!

21:41.900 --> 21:42.820
Let's rock this...

21:42.820 --> 21:44.340
Paradise island?

21:46.380 --> 21:47.940
 This is take two.

21:48.020 --> 21:50.180
That wig has got to come off
some day, sister.

21:50.180 --> 21:51.820
And that day is today!

21:51.820 --> 21:54.820
lt's time for Miley Stewart
to show this world what she's got!

21:54.820 --> 21:58.470
Let's rock this island paradise! Whoo!

22:01.940 --> 22:03.420
Hi Han... 

22:07.020 --> 22:07.940
Sorry.

22:07.980 --> 22:09.700
But the last thing
l need is to be robbed...

22:09.700 --> 22:12.300
Not ''robbed'' and not ''last thing''.

22:13.580 --> 22:15.060
What are you sitting around for?

22:15.060 --> 22:17.040
Heard you have concert tickets
into the...

22:19.260 --> 22:20.620
Take two.

22:22.380 --> 22:24.980
Hey. What are you guys
sitting around for?
