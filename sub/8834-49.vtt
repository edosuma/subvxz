Walter's turn. Speak.

01:09.458 --> 01:11.125
Yes, Mr. Khan.

01:11.208 --> 01:14.834
I'm investing
my 20,000 dollar budget in petroleum,

01:14.917 --> 01:18.583
what with planes and automobiles
a growth industry.

01:18.792 --> 01:22.917
Excellent. And with your money, Harmond?

01:23.125 --> 01:26.917
Electronics, sir.
Telephones, radios, phonographs--

01:27.125 --> 01:31.458
-[Harmond] The wave of the future.
-To be sure. Benson?

01:31.667 --> 01:35.667
[clears throat] I plan to invest
in glow-in-the-dark sunglasses.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.333
They're easy to find during a blackout.

01:38.542 --> 01:40.375
Fascinating.

01:40.542 --> 01:43.250
Once you have found them,

01:43.333 --> 01:45.417
you wear them in the dark.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.125
-[laughing]
-Very good, Mr. Khan!

01:48.333 --> 01:49.709
Stop laughing.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.625
Think harder, Benson.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.834
Good day, gentlemen. Ladies.

02:01.458 --> 02:03.959
[sighs] I made a total fool of myself.

02:04.041 --> 02:06.083
It happens, Dougie.

02:06.291 --> 02:09.458
-Douglas!
-You need a break.

02:09.542 --> 02:11.667
Let me take you somewhere fun.

02:14.792 --> 02:17.417
[jazz music playing]

02:20.542 --> 02:22.250
[laughing]

02:25.542 --> 02:27.959
So is this place great, or what?

02:28.125 --> 02:30.458
I have to impress Mr. Khan.

02:30.667 --> 02:33.375
[scatting]

02:44.166 --> 02:47.208
[all cheering]

02:49.667 --> 02:52.709
Maybe a hot investment, or a new product.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.458
All right! Hit it, Montgomery!

03:05.417 --> 03:07.458
[guests whistle]

03:07.792 --> 03:10.083
What's with the flaming pastry?

03:10.291 --> 03:12.583
To celebrate the fifth anniversary

03:12.792 --> 03:16.083
of this run-down shack
you call a nightclub.

03:16.166 --> 03:17.583
[all cheering]

03:20.458 --> 03:22.917
Has it been five years already?

03:23.291 --> 03:27.834
Five years ago right here,
I downed my first fruit juice.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.083
[laughs] I'll bet you didn't pay me
for that one, either.

03:45.917 --> 03:48.041
A hot business to take over?

03:48.458 --> 03:52.375
Cats and kittens,
I remember when I left Cape Suzette

03:52.458 --> 03:54.917
and moved to this deserted rock.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.250
Everybody said I'd fail.

03:57.458 --> 04:00.792
You stuck with me like a bad habit.

04:01.208 --> 04:06.542
I want you to know,
I really do appreciate your money.

04:06.792 --> 04:09.500
[all laugh]

04:11.125 --> 04:15.458
Hold on! This is it, Walters.
I'll invest here.

04:15.709 --> 04:18.000
-[Walters] What?
-You, ape!

04:18.375 --> 04:20.916
The name's Louie, three-piece.

04:21.125 --> 04:24.709
Right. Listen, I want to buy your place.

04:24.834 --> 04:28.125
I can offer you,
say, 5,000 dollars?

04:28.208 --> 04:31.583
[laughs] Get this, folks,
this little wheeze

04:31.667 --> 04:35.667
-wants my place for five Gs.
-What do you say?

04:35.875 --> 04:39.500
I say, K-N-O-W, no!

04:42.500 --> 04:44.917
How about nine-- uh, ten?

04:45.125 --> 04:46.333
A big fat hen.

04:51.291 --> 04:55.500
OK, 20,000. That's my final offer.

04:55.667 --> 04:58.291
Well, here's my final answer.

04:58.500 --> 05:03.208
-[Benson] No sale?
-A pleasure not doing business with you.

05:04.542 --> 05:07.667
Stop laughing!

05:10.834 --> 05:13.291
That ape made me look foolish.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.959
Um, I think you beat him to it.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.792
[clerk] Well, actually,
he has a squatter's deed.

05:19.875 --> 05:21.208
[Benson] What's that mean?

05:21.291 --> 05:23.792
It renews itself each year

05:24.000 --> 05:27.875
so long as Louie remains on the island.

05:27.959 --> 05:31.208
It expires tomorrow night. If he leaves?

05:31.417 --> 05:36.125
Anyone who puts up a building
on the land inherits the deed.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.041
Yes!

05:39.417 --> 05:40.709
Don't laugh.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.208
Mr. Khan?

05:50.375 --> 05:52.083
Mr. Khan?

05:52.250 --> 05:53.375
Good.

05:57.083 --> 05:59.333
I'll show that ape.

05:59.417 --> 06:01.917
Ah, Khan's stationery.

06:03.291 --> 06:06.125
"Do whatever Mr. Benson asks."

06:11.500 --> 06:15.375
"Signed, Shere Khan."

06:32.250 --> 06:35.625
I never knew I had so many friends.

06:35.709 --> 06:37.417
Look at these gifts.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.125
[Louie] Booga booga!

06:41.583 --> 06:43.834
Excuse us, Louie.

06:43.917 --> 06:48.667
-We forgot something in the <i>Sea Duck.</i>
-Oh, yeah. Be right back.

06:48.750 --> 06:51.417
Don't let the party die. [laughs]

06:53.041 --> 06:56.875
Say, Junior, no hard feelings
about last night, huh?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.500
No. I don't want to buy your island.

06:59.583 --> 07:01.750
Well, that's fine.

07:01.959 --> 07:03.375
I'm going to take it.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.333
Man, you don't give up.

07:06.417 --> 07:10.917
If you're off this island at midnight,
you'll lose your lease.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.458
That may be, cuz,
but I'm not going anywhere!

07:15.709 --> 07:18.458
You will when my friends get here.

07:18.667 --> 07:21.083
[laughs] You hear that?

07:21.166 --> 07:24.333
This little sprout's
going to throw me out.

07:25.709 --> 07:27.875
Stop laughing! I'll do it.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.458
Yeah, you and whose army?

07:30.875 --> 07:33.417
-Shere Khan.
-[all gasp]

07:35.875 --> 07:38.792
His elite pilot force
will be here at high noon.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.959
Look at the time!

07:41.834 --> 07:46.000
-I'm getting a cold.
-I've got a vacation coming.

07:46.375 --> 07:50.834
No one is stupid enough
to risk the wrath of Khan.

07:51.041 --> 07:56.333
Hey, happy anniversary, Louie!
What did you do to the party?

07:56.500 --> 07:59.750
Can you imagine?
Everyone just took off

07:59.834 --> 08:03.709
because Khan is sending goons
to take over my place.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.333
We'll stay.

08:05.542 --> 08:09.208
We only got two hours,
so let's make a plan.

08:10.041 --> 08:12.917
-What will we do?
-[Benson] Give up?

08:15.542 --> 08:17.792
Maybe we can make some defenses.

08:17.959 --> 08:19.959
If you're smart, you'll make tracks.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.667
[laughs] Look who's laughing now.

08:23.875 --> 08:27.333
No, Junior. Look who's leaving now.

08:29.917 --> 08:33.792
Whoa!

08:38.166 --> 08:41.000
Why does Khan want you out of business?

08:41.082 --> 08:42.708
The guy's ruthless.

08:43.207 --> 08:46.291
Ugly Dougly's right about my deed.

08:46.375 --> 08:50.500
If I'm thrown out before midnight,
I lose everything.

08:50.709 --> 08:53.917
-I got to stop them.
-Let's get cracking.

08:56.917 --> 09:00.208
Thirty-eight... 39... 40.

09:00.375 --> 09:05.166
-Ooh, Khan wants you out bad.
-We're ready for him.

09:06.375 --> 09:09.041
Listen up! This letter puts me in charge.

09:09.417 --> 09:11.041
I have two goals.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.291
One, erect a headquarters there,

09:13.500 --> 09:17.500
and two, evict the three people
inside that building.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.709
Follow me.

09:24.417 --> 09:26.500
Stop laughing!

09:28.083 --> 09:29.875
[all laugh]

09:30.000 --> 09:31.875
You! You go first.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.458
That does it! Forward!

09:48.542 --> 09:49.875
Backward!

09:54.458 --> 09:57.041
I thought you said
there were only three of them.

09:57.917 --> 09:59.291
I-- I don't get it.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.792
Well, get them!

10:30.000 --> 10:32.709
All clear, sir.

10:32.792 --> 10:35.166
It's over, Louie. We have you.

10:35.375 --> 10:39.333
[Louie] No, cuz. We have you.

10:43.375 --> 10:44.458
Whoa!

10:48.417 --> 10:51.125
Hey! Whoa!

11:02.208 --> 11:04.583
[Louie] Kit, the balcony! Quick!

11:07.625 --> 11:10.500
-[Kit] What now?
-Grab some tree and follow me.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.291
Climb! We've got them.

11:14.792 --> 11:16.625
[Kit] They're still coming!

11:18.166 --> 11:22.000
-[Louie] To the penthouse.
-Walk on your own feet, fella.

11:23.542 --> 11:27.333
[Benson] Give up! I've got more pilots
than you have furniture.

11:27.542 --> 11:32.125
[out of breath]
We're up a tree without a paddle.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.041
It's over.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.667
Well, it's over. Surrender.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.458
I have not yet begun to bite.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.875
-[Louie] You a swinger?
-The swingingest.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.375
Then take it, Buzzy!

11:53.375 --> 11:55.542
Adios. Bye-bye.

11:58.667 --> 12:02.875
Ah! My future's so bright,
I've got to wear shades.

12:06.291 --> 12:07.750
Shoddy workmanship.

12:08.291 --> 12:10.458
[Kit] Don't make things like they used to.

12:12.667 --> 12:15.834
What are you looking at? After them!

12:21.417 --> 12:25.291
Rebuild it, and sturdier this time.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.875
What a poindexter.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.625
[panting] We lost them.

12:32.709 --> 12:34.792
Hey, skyjackers, over here!

12:35.000 --> 12:38.041
-Why did you do that?
-I built a super-duper trap

12:38.125 --> 12:40.417
up there years ago. If we can get to it,

12:40.500 --> 12:43.333
these bozos will never win. Come on.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.625
What's this doing here?

12:50.959 --> 12:53.917
My sightseeing railroad.
Never finished it.

12:54.208 --> 12:56.125
[Baloo] Just what the doctor ordered.

12:56.250 --> 12:59.208
-No. Leave it!
-Huh?

12:59.417 --> 13:03.375
There they go,
and they left transportation! Get them!

13:04.583 --> 13:08.041
[Baloo panting] Why should they ride
while we go on foot?

13:08.125 --> 13:10.709
[Louie laughing] You'll see.

13:19.291 --> 13:23.875
-One day, I'll put in that tunnel.
-Ba-rutal!

13:26.083 --> 13:29.875
Oh, man, somebody in this basket
could go on a diet.

13:29.959 --> 13:32.125
His initials are Baloo.

13:32.333 --> 13:37.166
-I'm just big for my age.
-Right. Must be the stone age.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.917
[Baloo] I am not that heavy.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.417
[Kit and Louie grunt]

13:48.875 --> 13:51.667
One, two, one, two...

13:51.875 --> 13:54.375
-We'd better skedaddle.
-Wait.

13:54.583 --> 13:58.208
We've got them now. One, two, one, two...

13:58.375 --> 14:01.500
One, two, one-- Uh-oh.

14:08.959 --> 14:12.083
Two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one...

14:12.458 --> 14:14.417
[screaming]

14:18.417 --> 14:21.333
Don't just stand there. Resplice the line.

14:21.417 --> 14:27.208
We're tired of taking your lumps,
so splice it yourself, Dougie.

14:30.041 --> 14:33.750
Ever since I was five years old,
people have laughed at me.

14:34.083 --> 14:37.709
"Little Dougie. What a nobody."
[imitates laughing]

14:37.792 --> 14:42.709
Well, I'm somebody now,
'cause I've got this.

14:42.917 --> 14:46.875
If you want to keep your pathetic jobs,

14:47.041 --> 14:50.542
you'll do what I say. Got it?

14:50.792 --> 14:52.625
Yes, sir.

14:54.834 --> 14:58.959
[Khan] Miss Greeley,
send for my elite pilot squad.

14:59.166 --> 15:02.458
[Miss Greeley] <i>They're still</i>
<i>on that mission you requested.</i>

15:02.667 --> 15:05.083
I requested?

15:09.834 --> 15:11.458
[grunts]

15:12.542 --> 15:17.375
[panting] I don't know
how much farther I can go, Louie.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.625
Well, let's rest a sec, cuz.

15:22.959 --> 15:25.417
[Kit] Man, those guys don't quit.

15:25.625 --> 15:29.333
[panting] Yeah. Maybe we should.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.542
I agree.

15:32.917 --> 15:36.083
Sorry, sport fans. No can do.

15:36.166 --> 15:41.917
Everything I love is here.
Good music, good times, good friends.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.750
I'm not giving it up,
not even to Shere Khan.

15:46.834 --> 15:48.792
[sighs] But we can't run anymore.

15:48.875 --> 15:51.208
Don't have to. We're here.

15:51.375 --> 15:54.041
-Where?
-My super-duper trap.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.291
[both] Really?

15:55.500 --> 15:58.792
[Louie] A whole lot of loggin'
to knock their noggins.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.875
Give this a jerk,
and those jerks go bye-bye.

16:04.083 --> 16:06.041
Then do it.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.834
[grunts]

16:19.208 --> 16:24.125
-This is your super-duper trap?
-OK. So it's rusty.

16:24.208 --> 16:27.125
Relax. Just give me a boost.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.375
[Baloo grunts]

16:37.208 --> 16:38.792
Oh, no!

16:47.792 --> 16:50.709
Hey, nice shot, Little Britches.

16:51.625 --> 16:54.125
[Kit] But not nice enough.

16:55.750 --> 16:59.208
That's it. No more Mr. Nice Doug.

17:00.542 --> 17:04.625
Send up the fighter planes.
I want those clowns shot.

17:12.959 --> 17:16.541
[panting] Maybe they won't find us
in the dark.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.750
Hey, uh, it's on a timer.

17:42.083 --> 17:44.834
Give it up, Louie. You're mine.

17:45.083 --> 17:48.709
-Never!
-Give it up. He's got us.

17:48.792 --> 17:51.583
One more hour, I win.

17:51.750 --> 17:53.500
Don't be crazy, Louie.

17:53.583 --> 17:56.417
[electricity crackling]

17:57.792 --> 17:59.875
One more time.

18:16.959 --> 18:21.417
[grunts] OK, OK. You win. Call them off.

18:21.709 --> 18:26.250
[Benson laughing] You did it.
You did it, Dougie boy.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.291
Ahem! I mean Douglas.

18:30.083 --> 18:33.542
[electricity crackling]

18:40.417 --> 18:43.041
I'm going to miss this place.

18:43.208 --> 18:46.667
Five minutes to midnight. Into the boat!

18:46.834 --> 18:51.208
Yeah, yeah. OK. Mind if I take mementos?

18:51.291 --> 18:53.291
Just be quick about it.

18:53.458 --> 18:58.125
Guess I'll take the juicer,
my tiki masks, oh, yeah, and, uh...

18:58.125 --> 19:01.333
Don't forget your grass mat.

19:01.709 --> 19:03.250
I don't want that.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.500
Your lucky mat, Louie?

19:05.667 --> 19:09.291
Oh, right. My lucky mat.

19:09.375 --> 19:11.208
I'll give you a hand.

19:18.208 --> 19:20.125
Whoa!

19:20.208 --> 19:22.917
[Baloo] Let's make like a tree
and get out of here.

19:24.041 --> 19:27.166
[Kit] Almost midnight.
They'll never catch us.

19:27.250 --> 19:30.625
-[Benson] Stop!
-No way, Monet. We're home free.

19:31.041 --> 19:34.333
[Benson]
Maybe you are, but your club isn't.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.792
Huh? My club?

19:36.959 --> 19:42.125
I took the opportunity
of dynamiting your beloved dump.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.917
Forget it, Louie. It's just a building.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.500
No, kid. It's Louie's whole life.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.542
Thirty seconds.

19:54.625 --> 19:57.500
All right, Doug-lips. I'll leave.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.750
-[Louie] Promise not to hurt my club.
-[Benson] Deal.

20:04.667 --> 20:09.125
I built that place
by hand from bits and pieces.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.583
Yeah, yeah.

20:10.750 --> 20:15.750
On the other hand,
I think I'll blow up the club anyway.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.375
[laughing]

20:17.542 --> 20:19.041
No, no!

20:23.834 --> 20:25.458
No boom-boom?

20:25.625 --> 20:28.250
[stutters] Mr. Khan! Sir!

20:28.417 --> 20:30.583
<i>Quelle surprise!</i>

20:30.750 --> 20:33.291
What happened to my pilots?

20:33.458 --> 20:36.834
-They did it.
-[Khan] Just the two of them?

20:36.917 --> 20:39.583
-[Benson] The kid helped.
-I'm impressed.

20:39.667 --> 20:42.041
Explain yourself, Benson.

20:42.417 --> 20:45.709
[Benson] I acquired this
money-making island for you.

20:45.792 --> 20:48.458
No. You forged my name,

20:48.542 --> 20:52.500
misused employees, broke a verbal deal,

20:52.625 --> 20:55.583
and your suit is not up to standard.

20:55.709 --> 20:58.834
All done with your best interest in mind.

20:58.917 --> 21:01.333
In my best interest, Benson,

21:01.500 --> 21:03.500
you are terminated.

21:03.959 --> 21:06.458
T-- T-- T-- T-- Terminated?

21:06.625 --> 21:11.375
I apologize for
young Benson's excess zeal.

21:11.458 --> 21:14.083
Khanie, nothing we couldn't handle.

21:14.792 --> 21:18.500
[stutters]
Fire me? Humiliate me? Laugh at me?

21:18.583 --> 21:19.875
[laughing hysterically] I'll show them.

21:20.041 --> 21:22.792
[Benson] Khan! Louie! Get out here!

21:23.291 --> 21:25.375
[Benson] Pay attention, you toads.

21:25.625 --> 21:29.709
Tonight, Douglas Benson
gets the last laugh.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.709
-Not again.
-Duck!

21:32.792 --> 21:34.250
Too late.

21:36.083 --> 21:39.875
-What happened?
-I sort of moved the dynamite.

21:40.041 --> 21:41.417
Bravo.

21:42.625 --> 21:46.000
[all laughing]

21:51.375 --> 21:53.333
Stop laughing.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.625
[laughing] Hit it, shortstop.

22:04.750 --> 22:07.834
[Louie] You see, Baloo?
Light does make right.
