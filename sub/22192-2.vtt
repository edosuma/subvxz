WEBVTT

00:05.000 --> 00:08.041
Yes!

00:15.750 --> 00:21.125
Welcome to another gut-socking,
chin-kicking, nose-busting episode of...

00:22.291 --> 00:25.166
Monday Night Ninja Fights!

00:26.750 --> 00:28.833
I can't believe you like this show.

00:28.916 --> 00:32.833
It's got ninjas, fighting,
ninjas fighting, and a sick theme song.

00:32.916 --> 00:35.458
-What's not to like?
-For starters? That guy.

00:35.541 --> 00:39.041
And here's our reigning champion,
Berserker!

00:39.125 --> 00:41.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:41.375 --> 00:43.625
Berserker is the worst!

00:43.708 --> 00:47.125
- Berserker is the best!
- Whoa. Can he hear us?

00:47.208 --> 00:49.833
As the "Greatest Ninja Warrior
Who Ever Lived Ever."

00:49.916 --> 00:51.375
That's not a real title.

00:51.458 --> 00:54.875
I dare anyone in the Skylands
to try and beat me.

00:54.958 --> 00:58.208
Even that little Skylander, Stealth Elf!

00:58.291 --> 00:59.958
Yeah, you heard me.

01:00.041 --> 01:03.791
I know you're at home watching,
and my title is real!

01:03.875 --> 01:05.458
Seriously, are we miked?

01:13.791 --> 01:16.791
- Berserker out!
- That's it!

01:16.875 --> 01:20.750
If it's a fight Berserker wants,
then it's a fight Berserker will get.

01:20.833 --> 01:24.708
I'm going to dedicate myself
by taking that Drow clown down.

01:25.916 --> 01:30.041
Uh, could you also dedicate yourself
to getting us a new TV?

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074

02:03.666 --> 02:07.208
Berserker is the epitome of everything
a ninja warrior shouldn't be.

02:07.291 --> 02:10.500
He's crude, loud
and never stops running his big mouth.

02:10.583 --> 02:11.916
That may be true, Elf,

02:12.000 --> 02:15.666
but he's still a very dangerous foe
with great ninja skill.

02:15.750 --> 02:18.958
If you want to challenge him,
you must master the mind-body connection

02:19.041 --> 02:21.708
that is the trademark
of all great ninja warriors.

02:21.791 --> 02:25.333
-You must... be the ninja.
-But I am a ninja.

02:25.416 --> 02:28.750
Right. But you must be the ninja.

02:29.333 --> 02:33.958
-But I am a ninja!
-But you must be the ninja.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.875
-But I am a--
-Oh, for the love of...

02:40.000 --> 02:42.916
I have trained you
to the best of my ability.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.083
But as I always suspected,
what you need to reach your full potential

02:47.166 --> 02:49.750
is the training of a true ninja.

02:49.833 --> 02:51.500
Huh? Another ninja? Who?

02:51.583 --> 02:55.625
You must seek out Skylander Ninjini,
the great ninja-genie-giant,

02:55.708 --> 02:59.208
who, after breaking free
of her gas-lamp prison, became--

02:59.291 --> 03:02.833
One of the greatest ninjas!
I had a poster of Ninjini

03:02.916 --> 03:05.500
on my wall when I was little.
She's a legend.

03:05.583 --> 03:09.916
With Ninjini's help, there's no way
I'll lose to Berserker, or anyone else.

03:10.000 --> 03:15.166
If you insist on facing Berserker,
then I insist you win.

03:15.250 --> 03:18.250
A loss to him would embolden
the other villains of Skylands

03:18.333 --> 03:20.250
to keep challenging the Skylanders,

03:20.333 --> 03:24.333
which would further fuel their quest
to reign darkness over our world.

03:24.416 --> 03:27.458
I won't let you or the Skylands down,
Master Eon.

03:27.541 --> 03:31.583
Now, this is Ninjini's last known address
in the deep Falling Forest.

03:31.666 --> 03:37.041
But beware. Who knows what evil lurks
in those dark trees?

03:38.250 --> 03:41.833
This place isn't fit for sewer sheep,
let alone a queen.

03:41.916 --> 03:45.666
Nay, your Goldness!
It's a disgrace unworthy of your gilded--

03:45.750 --> 03:49.166
And you, stop following me.

03:49.250 --> 03:52.000
Make yourself useful
and clean up this dump.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.916
Okay, Doom Raiders,
you heard milady!

03:57.000 --> 03:58.541
Time to clean! Chop chop.

03:58.625 --> 04:01.041
-Not happening.
-How 'bout I "chop chop" you!

04:01.125 --> 04:03.458
-I like my camp as is!
-Nope.

04:03.958 --> 04:06.375
Helping friends is fun!

04:06.458 --> 04:09.958
Fine. You're better than nothing...
I think.

04:10.041 --> 04:15.625
Now, as memory serves,
cleaning is usually a delightful activity.

04:35.916 --> 04:38.916
I do miss my Glumshanks.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.750
I counted on him
to do my literal dirty work.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.875
I wonder what he's doing right now.

04:43.958 --> 04:45.250
Okay, study group friends.

04:45.333 --> 04:49.125
It is time to expand
those intellectual horizons.

04:49.208 --> 04:52.833
Now, I thought Atlas Shrugged
was inspired, melding...

04:52.916 --> 04:57.166
"I know dirty towels
don't go on the floor, Claire,

04:57.250 --> 05:02.666
but I was late for school
because someone forgot to set the alarm."

05:03.250 --> 05:05.916
Send!

05:06.000 --> 05:09.125
Now, if you'll turn to chapter four,
Mr. Squirrel...

05:11.583 --> 05:14.000
What is taking Hugo so long?

05:14.083 --> 05:17.125
If this emergency delivery
is so important to Master Eon,

05:17.208 --> 05:19.166
you'd think Hugo'd get a wriggle on.

05:19.250 --> 05:20.916
Give the guy a minute, JV.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.791
A bathroom break
shouldn't have time restrictions.

05:23.875 --> 05:26.791
It should when it happens
in one of the spookiest spots

05:26.875 --> 05:28.125
in the Falling Forest.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.875
It's literally called
the "Field of Fiends"!

05:30.958 --> 05:32.791
Mommy!

05:43.041 --> 05:44.041
Wow.

05:48.916 --> 05:53.416
Somebody call a plumber,
'cause these pipes are about to burst!

05:53.500 --> 05:57.666
Those pipes are gonna burst in my belly!

05:57.750 --> 06:04.166
I got ninja fights to train for,
and I'm gonna fuel up on Mabu stew!

06:17.500 --> 06:19.250
Hello? Ninjini?

06:19.833 --> 06:21.041
Hello!

06:30.541 --> 06:35.875
Who dares disturb the great Ninjini?

06:39.750 --> 06:42.583
Oh, my, I am sorry, my dear.

06:42.666 --> 06:44.875
I had quite the tickle
caught in my throat.

06:44.958 --> 06:49.500
Even gave myself a fright with all that,
"Who dares disturb Ninjini" business.

06:49.583 --> 06:53.041
Sweet sheep in the sunshine.
The Great Ninjini!

06:53.125 --> 06:56.958
-It's really you!
-It is, but I just go by Ninjini now.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.583
Ah, the "Great" part was a bit much.

06:59.666 --> 07:01.708
Well, I'm Stealth Elf, the Skylander,

07:01.791 --> 07:04.791
and Master Eon sent me to find you
because you're the only one

07:04.875 --> 07:07.333
who can train me to "be the ninja."

07:08.000 --> 07:10.875
-Whatever that means.
-Ninja training, eh?

07:10.958 --> 07:14.916
I need to reach my full potential
so I can crush that bully, Berserker.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.958
Well, if it's training you came for,
then it's training you shall receive.

07:20.041 --> 07:25.125
After you receive some of my forest-famous
lemon bars. Back in a jif!

07:25.708 --> 07:28.208
Ninja training, here I come!

07:32.333 --> 07:35.166
Sorry to interrupt your beard sculpting,
Master Eon,

07:35.250 --> 07:36.500
but we have a huge problem.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.500
A Hugo problem, that is.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.458
-He's gone missing!
-What happened?

07:40.541 --> 07:42.416
He took a bathroom break en route

07:42.500 --> 07:44.166
to the mission you sent him on.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.500
But when he did, he never came back.

07:46.583 --> 07:48.875
Skylanders, you must find him.

07:48.958 --> 07:53.458
Search the entire Skylands
from top to... top if you must!

07:53.541 --> 07:57.583
Hugo is not only my valued assistant,
but he helps me in many ways.

07:57.666 --> 07:59.083
Important ways!

07:59.166 --> 08:00.625
Vague, yet important ways!

08:00.708 --> 08:03.250
Should we go get Elfy to help us,
Master Eon?

08:03.333 --> 08:05.583
Stealth Elf is on her own
personal mission,

08:05.666 --> 08:08.958
one that is vital to the team's ability
to fight the greater evil

08:09.041 --> 08:10.708
infiltrating our world.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.750
So, this is Ambiguity Central.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.833
Come on, guys! We've got
a very important Mabu to track down.

08:21.875 --> 08:27.000
Oh, I got plans for you, Mabu man.
Crazy plans!

08:27.083 --> 08:31.541
Plans that will fry your brain
and cramp your hands!

08:31.625 --> 08:34.625
-But they're my best feature.
-Good!

08:34.707 --> 08:39.541
'Cause I'm so insane,
I'm gonna make you write greeting cards

08:39.625 --> 08:43.916
for every holiday and send them to...

08:44.000 --> 08:45.750
my mother!

08:47.625 --> 08:50.416
No! Please! Anything but--

08:51.166 --> 08:52.500
Wait, what?

08:52.583 --> 08:56.208
And I don't just mean Sheep Day
or Thankstaking.

08:56.291 --> 09:03.125
No! I'm talking Swipe Right Day,
Portal Master's Day, Fall Hat Day--

09:03.208 --> 09:05.791
Yes, it's a real holiday.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.875
Now, eat this cake.

09:07.958 --> 09:12.125
I want you nice and plump
before I have you for dinner!

09:12.208 --> 09:17.625
There's nothing I love more than a Mabu
stuffed with delicious cake and frosting.

09:17.708 --> 09:21.041
Because I'm crazy!

09:21.125 --> 09:24.125
This is the most confusing abduction ever.

09:32.291 --> 09:36.375
That was great. Just great.

09:36.458 --> 09:38.875
Like the last nine songs
you played about sheep.

09:39.458 --> 09:43.708
I found many delightful ways to fill
my days since I found the will power

09:43.791 --> 09:47.791
to break the spell my genie bottle held
and escape all those years ago.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.750
-What happened to the bottle?
-I haven't the foggiest idea.

09:50.833 --> 09:55.000
Once I broke free,
I flew away and never looked back.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.416
Hey, would you like to watch me
play Cocoa Crash ?

09:58.500 --> 10:02.333
I'm stuck at level 239,
but I think it might be my lucky day.

10:02.416 --> 10:04.583
I'd really just rather start my training.

10:04.666 --> 10:07.291
Lemon bar?
Come on. You know you want it.

10:07.375 --> 10:10.833
Ugh! I can't eat another lemon bar.
I've already had six.

10:10.916 --> 10:13.916
What I really need is
to start the training you promised me.

10:14.750 --> 10:17.375
Well, I never actually promised.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.083
I believe my exact words were,

10:19.166 --> 10:22.000
"If it's training you want,
it's training you shall receive."

10:22.583 --> 10:25.625
I didn't say from whom.
Specifically, I didn't say from me.

10:25.708 --> 10:29.208
I don't understand why you're nervous.
You're the Great Ninjini!

10:29.291 --> 10:31.333
I was the Great Ninjini.

10:31.416 --> 10:32.916
But that was long ago,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.875
when I was an active Skylander
defending the realm!

10:36.500 --> 10:40.875
It's been so long since I fought anyone,
I'm not sure I remember how to.

10:40.958 --> 10:43.500
Let alone teach someone
what I used to know.

10:45.250 --> 10:48.666
Perhaps it's best you find another ninja
who can complete your training.

10:48.750 --> 10:52.625
Seriously? That's it?
You won't try to help me beat Berserker?

10:52.708 --> 10:55.000
I told you, I don't think I can.

10:55.500 --> 10:59.541
But feel free to stay or visit me again
for any other reason, sweetie.

11:01.875 --> 11:05.708
What is that? Oh, my. Look at me!

11:06.208 --> 11:08.000
I was so young.

11:08.083 --> 11:12.666
So powerful. So... giant!
I guess it's true what they say.

11:12.750 --> 11:16.083
The camera really does add ten feet.
Where did you get this?

11:16.166 --> 11:18.416
My wall when I was a kid.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.416
I worshipped you.
I wanted to grow up to be you.

11:21.500 --> 11:26.750
Remember how it was to be powerful?
To be a hero? To be "the ninja"?

11:26.833 --> 11:30.541
Huh. I was quite the warrior
once upon a time, wasn't I?

11:30.625 --> 11:34.416
You still are. Eon still believes in you.
I believe in you.

11:34.500 --> 11:39.041
Okay, dear. I will train you to defeat
this mean old Berserker.

11:39.125 --> 11:42.750
Even if my time has passed,
it's clear yours is just beginning.

11:42.833 --> 11:47.208
And far be it from me
to stand in the way of your bright future.

11:47.291 --> 11:50.750
Now then, let's see what you've got.

12:18.125 --> 12:19.583
Whoa.

12:35.875 --> 12:39.458
I don't know why you're annoyed.
This cleaning thing is a breeze.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.875
Hey, guys!

12:40.958 --> 12:42.666
I found a teapot!

12:42.750 --> 12:47.041
If I combine the antioxidants of tea
with my super healing power,

12:47.125 --> 12:50.791
I could become... Brocco-Tea Guy!

12:50.875 --> 12:54.125
That ain't a tea potty-pot!

12:54.208 --> 12:56.583
It's a magical genie lampy-lamp.

12:56.666 --> 12:59.125
And I ain't seen it in years.

12:59.625 --> 13:04.125
What do ya say we make some evil wishes,
Doom Raiders?

13:04.208 --> 13:06.208
Oh, yeah.

13:10.208 --> 13:13.375
Ninjini, I truly can't thank you enough
for training me.

13:13.458 --> 13:15.833
This "being the ninja" thing is awesome.

13:15.916 --> 13:18.416
I should be the one thanking you,
Elf dear.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.291
You not only reminded me
what it means to "be the ninja,"

13:22.375 --> 13:26.750
but you reminded me what it felt like
to be the Great Ninjini once more.

13:26.833 --> 13:30.125
Now, bring it in
for the good stuff, little lady!

13:32.875 --> 13:34.208
No!

13:36.958 --> 13:39.375
I can't keep up! Take my hand!

13:55.208 --> 13:57.000
Oh, no. My genie lamp!

13:57.083 --> 13:58.916
You mean, our lamp.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.041
And since you must be the lamp's genie,
that means you belong to us!

14:08.583 --> 14:10.583
I know you.

14:10.666 --> 14:13.916
You're the Great Ninjini,
once a Skylander,

14:14.000 --> 14:18.916
but now nothing more than our servant
who must grant us whatever we desire.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.916
Not quite how it works, dearie.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.916
Congratulations. You rubbed my magic lamp,
summoning me to command.

14:27.000 --> 14:31.208
Rules of the lamp are as follows.
One, I am not liable for any disputes,

14:31.291 --> 14:34.000
injuries or lawsuits resulting
from improperly worded wishes.

14:34.083 --> 14:38.916
So if I say, "I wish for a best friend"...

14:43.541 --> 14:48.375
Yay! It's my pet rock
from when I was a kid. Joey!

14:49.250 --> 14:52.875
Rule two, and this is important
in light of what just happened.

14:53.458 --> 14:54.833
You only get three wishes.

14:54.916 --> 14:57.416
Which means, you have two left.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.000
Give me that, you nitwit!

15:00.083 --> 15:02.416
Rule three, you cannot reverse wishes.

15:03.083 --> 15:06.375
That concludes the rules of the lamp.
Now go, plot away.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.916
-What do y'all think?
-What should we wish for?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.083
Something to help us destroy
the Skylanders

15:12.166 --> 15:15.000
and plunge the Skylands
into eternal darkness!

15:15.083 --> 15:19.000
Exactly.
I say we use one wish to find Kaossandra,

15:19.083 --> 15:22.000
then the other to destroy the Skylanders!

15:22.083 --> 15:25.291
- All in favor, say "Aye."
- Aye!

15:25.958 --> 15:26.791
Kaos?

15:27.583 --> 15:29.208
Are you with us?

15:29.291 --> 15:31.625
I wish Glumshanks were here.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.541
It exists. It is real. It is...

15:41.416 --> 15:42.250
Glumshanks!

15:42.333 --> 15:45.125
Oh, how I've missed seeing your face.

15:45.208 --> 15:48.208
After making you eat so much ice cream
you get brain freeze!

15:48.291 --> 15:50.083
No. No.

15:50.916 --> 15:54.625
It can't be. I don't belong here.

15:54.708 --> 15:59.041
How did this happen?!

15:59.125 --> 16:01.708
Simple, Glumwad.
You see, we have this genie lamp

16:01.791 --> 16:04.333
and I haphazardly wished
you were my servant again.

16:04.416 --> 16:05.916
And now here you are!

16:06.000 --> 16:09.666
But, I was finally pursuing my dream
of academia.

16:09.750 --> 16:14.958
I was in my element! I... was happy.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.166
Glummy!

16:17.250 --> 16:23.000
You fool! You wasted another wish.
Now we only have one left.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.625
Hey!

16:24.708 --> 16:28.416
Okay, Queenie. So what do we spend
our final wish on?

16:28.500 --> 16:31.875
Destroying the Skylanders
or finding Kaossandra?

16:31.958 --> 16:34.375
Ninjini. What are you waiting for?

16:34.458 --> 16:36.666
Free yourself from the lamp
while they're distracted.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.083
I... I don't know if I can.

16:39.166 --> 16:43.541
The last time was so long ago,
I'm not sure if I have it in me.

16:43.625 --> 16:47.166
Of course you do!
Remember, you're the Great Ninjini,

16:47.250 --> 16:50.333
not the "adequate" Ninjini
or "meh" Ninjini.

16:50.416 --> 16:52.458
You've inspired me to be great, too!

16:52.541 --> 16:55.041
You freed yourself once,
you can do it again.

16:55.125 --> 17:00.250
You've always been my hero, Ninjini.
Now it's time to be the Skylands' hero.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.416
Okay. Stand back.

17:09.290 --> 17:10.125
Ninjini?

17:10.208 --> 17:11.790
Ninjini! No!

17:11.875 --> 17:14.915
Hey! This is a Doom Raider private event.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.790
No Skylanders allowed!

17:16.875 --> 17:20.625
But since you're here,
we can have our cake and eat it too,

17:20.708 --> 17:25.500
by destroying one Skylander
without wasting a wish.

17:25.583 --> 17:30.291
-Yay! Cake!
-There's not really a cake, nitwit!

17:30.375 --> 17:32.458
Glummy? What are you doing?

17:32.541 --> 17:37.333
Investing in my future.
I wish I was back at school!

17:38.333 --> 17:42.166
Back in my day, you had to levitate
ten miles through snow

17:42.250 --> 17:43.625
to get to a portal.

17:43.708 --> 17:45.166
I'm back, baby.

17:52.583 --> 17:54.125
Bottle blast!

17:54.708 --> 17:59.500
Who dares disturb the Great Ninjini
or the Great Stealth Elf?

17:59.583 --> 18:03.125
Ninjini! I thought you were trapped
back in your bottle forever!

18:03.208 --> 18:06.416
Nope. I just went in there
so these meanies would think that,

18:06.500 --> 18:08.583
so I could do this.

18:13.541 --> 18:15.458
Hyah! Hyah!

18:24.291 --> 18:27.041
-Whoo!
-Looks like you got your mojo back!

18:27.125 --> 18:30.916
And you, young lady,
have completed your ninja training!

18:31.000 --> 18:34.583
Now, there's only one thing left
for you to do.

18:34.666 --> 18:38.500
"And then I went for a hike,
followed by brunch with friends.

18:38.583 --> 18:41.708
By friends, I mean some Mabu."

18:41.791 --> 18:46.750
-"And by brunch, I mean I ate them."
-You're still on the Flag Day card?

18:47.958 --> 18:52.166
Come on! Card-writin' time is over!
I'm hungry.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.791
And you're dinner!

18:53.875 --> 18:56.083
Stop playing with your food, Berserker.

18:56.166 --> 18:57.916
The Skylanders! Hooray!

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
What? How did you find us?

19:01.083 --> 19:03.416
Hugo sent us this beautifully written
greeting card

19:03.500 --> 19:06.125
wishing us a "Happy Skylander Day."

19:06.208 --> 19:09.708
And it had your exact location,
thanks to the return address!

19:09.791 --> 19:11.875
How did you get that past me?

19:11.958 --> 19:15.833
Well, you said you can't read or write,
so pretty easily.

19:15.916 --> 19:17.208
It don't matter.

19:17.291 --> 19:21.333
All you Skysuckers combined
are no match for me.

19:21.416 --> 19:26.250
The Greatest Ninja Ever
in the World Ever of All Time!

19:26.833 --> 19:28.333
Ever!

19:29.291 --> 19:33.250
-That's not a real title!
-Elfy! You're back!

19:33.333 --> 19:35.000
Did you complete your secret training

19:35.083 --> 19:37.291
Master Eon wouldn't tell us
anything about?

19:37.375 --> 19:42.041
Oh, yeah! Which means I finally have
what it takes to take Berserker out.

19:42.125 --> 19:44.208
Hugo. What are you doing here?

19:44.291 --> 19:47.208
Berserker said he was gonna eat me
so he could carbo-load

19:47.291 --> 19:48.916
before more ninja fighting.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.291
I have to be honest.
I was having a very nice time--

19:52.375 --> 19:53.541
Shut it, fool!

19:53.625 --> 19:55.458
All right, Berserker. You wanted me?

19:55.541 --> 19:58.375
You got me! It's go time.

19:58.458 --> 20:02.291
I don't need this cake-filled Mabu
to take you down.

20:02.375 --> 20:07.583
I'll do it all on my own.
Because I'm crazy!

20:08.958 --> 20:10.000
Let's fight!

20:10.708 --> 20:12.166
Hyah!

20:14.875 --> 20:17.916
"Be the ninja."

20:27.875 --> 20:32.166
I am the Greatest Ninja Ever now!

20:32.250 --> 20:33.833
Elf for the win!

20:33.916 --> 20:36.208
- Amazing!
- My hero!

20:37.666 --> 20:40.666
It must feel just dandy to know
that you are the greatest ninja

20:40.750 --> 20:43.166
in all the Skylands now, eh, Elf dear?

20:43.250 --> 20:44.875
I learned from the best.

20:44.958 --> 20:48.750
But I have a long way to go
before I compare myself to her.

20:48.833 --> 20:49.791
Oh, almost forgot.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.750
-My lamp! How did you...?
-I grabbed it at the campsite.

20:54.833 --> 20:57.458
I didn't want it to fall
into the wrong hands again.

20:57.541 --> 20:59.208
Well, it's in the right hands.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.958
And there's no one in the Skylands
I'd trust with it more.

21:03.041 --> 21:07.916
Now remember, if you ever need me,
just rub the lamp and I will appear.

21:08.000 --> 21:12.125
But don't go crazy.
We're talking, like, business hours here.

21:15.833 --> 21:18.416
I am so happy you are okay, Hugo.

21:18.500 --> 21:22.916
You are not only my trusted friend,
but an asset to all of the Skylands.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.541
I bet you say that
to all of your trusty Mabu assistants.

21:27.625 --> 21:31.875
Of which I am the best,
as evident by my success

21:31.958 --> 21:34.791
finding what you sent me
to the Forest to retrieve.

21:34.875 --> 21:36.625
Well done, Hugo.

21:36.708 --> 21:39.416
Now, we must put this fossil
somewhere safe.

21:42.333 --> 21:46.208
Somewhere where it will never be found.
