08:49.153 --> 08:52.615
{\an8}JENNI WAS LIKE,
IF SAM TALKS TO ME,

08:52.698 --> 08:54.200
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE HER THE TIME OF DAY.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.955
{\an8}BOO?

08:59.038 --> 09:01.374
{\an8}MY ASS IS BURNING.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.000
{\an8}OH, MY GOD,
I'M SO ITCHY.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.919
{\an8}OW!

09:05.002 --> 09:06.462
{\an8}I WANTED TO GET,
LIKE, REALLY, REALLY DARK,

09:06.545 --> 09:07.213
{\an8}SO I DECIDED
TO USE LOTION.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.548
{\an8}I PUT A GLOB
ON MY ASS.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.967
{\an8}SO ITCHY,
IT'S ON FIRE,

09:11.050 --> 09:14.136
{\an8}AND I NEEDED RELIEVE ASAP,
BECAUSE IT DOES NOT FEEL GOOD.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.847
{\an8}OH, MY GOD, SOMEONE
NEEDS TO KISS MY ASS ASAP.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.933
{\an8}BOOEY, KISS MY ASS.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.268
{\an8}OH, WE GOT A FRIDGE.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.270
{\an8}THIS FEELS GOOD.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.229
{\an8}- ARE YOU ITCHING IT
ON SOMETHING?

09:23.312 --> 09:25.481
{\an8}- I'M IN THE FRIDGE.

09:25.564 --> 09:28.317
{\an8}- [laughs]

09:30.569 --> 09:33.531
{\an8}- [laughs] BOO-BOO.

09:33.614 --> 09:38.202
{\an8}MY BUTT FEELS BETTER.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.414
{\an8}I HAVE TO POOP.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.625
{\an8}- WAKING UP TODAY,
I'M NOT OKAY.

09:44.709 --> 09:48.421
{\an8}I THINK I NEED TO DO SOMETHING
TO GET OVER MIAMI,

09:48.504 --> 09:49.338
{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
RUINING ME.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.508
{\an8}I THINK, LIKE, AUTOMATICALLY,

09:52.591 --> 09:54.802
{\an8}IF RON'S
GOING OUT SOMEWHERE,

09:54.885 --> 09:55.678
{\an8}HE'S DOING SOMETHING
TO HURT ME,

09:55.761 --> 09:57.888
{\an8}LIKE LYING
AND CHEATING AGAIN.

09:57.972 --> 09:58.931
{\an8}- SLEEPING?

09:59.015 --> 10:00.808
{\an8}- I MAKE MYSELF
BELIEVE IT'S HAPPENING,

10:00.891 --> 10:02.852
{\an8}AND I MAKE MYSELF
GO CRAZY.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.312
{\an8}- WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:04.395 --> 10:06.480
{\an8}- YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.025
{\an8}PLEASE TELL ME THE TRUTH.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.359
{\an8}- ABOUT WHAT?

10:10.443 --> 10:11.569
{\an8}- LOOK ME IN THE FACE

10:11.652 --> 10:15.114
{\an8}AND ALL THE SKELETONS
LAY OUT RIGHT NOW,

10:15.197 --> 10:16.240
{\an8}BECAUSE I KNOW.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.575
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

10:17.658 --> 10:20.369
{\an8}- EVERYTHING.
- WHAT IS [bleep] EVERYTHING?

10:20.453 --> 10:21.370
{\an8}WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.205
{\an8}- TELL ME RIGHT NOW.
TELL ME.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.582
{\an8}- [bleep] TELL ME
WHAT YOU KNOW!

10:24.665 --> 10:25.374
{\an8}I'M NOT [bleep]
DOING THIS WITH YOU!

10:25.458 --> 10:27.877
{\an8}- TELL ME.
- [bleep] TALK!

10:27.960 --> 10:29.003
{\an8}YOU'RE 23 YEARS OLD.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.379
{\an8}BE A [bleep] WOMAN.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.547
{\an8}HOLY [bleep].

10:31.630 --> 10:33.632
{\an8}- HE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING LATELY.

10:33.716 --> 10:34.550
{\an8}- WHAT THE [bleep].
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

10:34.633 --> 10:35.885
{\an8}- WHAT THE [bleep]
DID I DO, MIKE?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.595
{\an8}HAVE I DONE ANYTHING?
WHAT THE [bleep] HAVE I DONE?

10:37.678 --> 10:39.555
{\an8}- LIVING WITH RON AND SAM
IN THE SAME ROOM,

10:39.639 --> 10:42.266
{\an8}IT'S JUST NOT
A GOOD SITUATION.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.018
{\an8}HONEST, DUDE, I CAN'T
EVEN TALK ABOUT THIS.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.436
{\an8}IT'S NOT EVEN COOL ANYMORE.
IT'S HORRIBLE, THESE TWO.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.646
{\an8}JUST BREAK THE [bleep] UP

10:47.730 --> 10:49.440
{\an8}AND CALL IT A DAY.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.274
{\an8}- GET THE [bleep] UP
AND LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.902
{\an8}I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:52.985 --> 10:55.071
{\an8}ENLIGHTEN ME, PLEASE.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.740
{\an8}APPARENTLY, I'M GETTING ACCUSED
FOR [bleep] THAT I DIDN'T DO,

10:57.823 --> 11:00.701
{\an8}SO I NEED A MIND CONDOM,

11:00.785 --> 11:01.952
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M BEING
MIND-[bleep]ED.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.247
{\an8}WHAT HAVE I DONE?
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I'VE DONE.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.999
{\an8}I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT
THE [bleep] YOU THINK YOU KNOW

11:07.083 --> 11:09.085
{\an8}ABOUT WHAT I'VE DONE
SINCE I'VE BEEN HOME FROM MIAMI.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.753
{\an8}THERE'S NOTHING
I'VE DONE TO YOU!

11:10.836 --> 11:12.088
{\an8}[bleep] NOTHING!

11:12.171 --> 11:14.173
{\an8}[bleep] NOTHING
I'VE DONE TO YOU.

11:14.256 --> 11:15.633
{\an8}- I'M GONNA BE REAL.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.176
{\an8}IT'S HER.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.302
{\an8}I'M GONNA BE REAL,
IT'S HER.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.929
{\an8}EVEN IF IT WAS HIS FAULT

11:20.012 --> 11:21.430
{\an8}AND HE [bleep]ED UP
IN MIAMI,

11:21.514 --> 11:24.350
{\an8}SHE NEEDS TO BE A WOMAN
AND BE LIKE, "[bleep] YOU.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.726
{\an8}I'M GONNA BE BY MYSELF,"

11:25.810 --> 11:27.228
{\an8}AND THEN THER--
- NOT JUST--

11:27.311 --> 11:29.271
{\an8}- YEAH, AND, THEREFORE,
IF THAT HAD HAPPENED,

11:29.355 --> 11:31.774
{\an8}YOU'LL SEE HIM
DO HIS THING, HAVE FUN,

11:31.857 --> 11:35.361
{\an8}AND THEN YOU'LL SEE HER
TRY TO GROW AS A PERSON

11:35.444 --> 11:37.822
{\an8}AND TRY TO HAVE SOME FUN,
WHICH SHE'S NEVER HAD.

11:37.905 --> 11:39.281
{\an8}- SHE'S NOT THE TYPE
TO LET LOOSE,

11:39.365 --> 11:40.157
{\an8}AND THAT'S IT.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.909
{\an8}- I FINISHED, OKAY?

11:41.992 --> 11:45.037
{\an8}I DIDN'T [bleep]IN' DO
A GOD[bleep] THING!

11:45.121 --> 11:46.580
{\an8}- LISTEN, I HAVE A FEELING

11:46.664 --> 11:48.791
{\an8}THAT YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING
TO ME AGAIN.

11:48.874 --> 11:49.792
{\an8}- WHAT HAVE I DONE?

11:49.875 --> 11:51.001
{\an8}- YOU TELL ME.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.212
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW
IF HE'S A CHANGED PERSON.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.171
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW IF I TRUST HIM.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.298
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW
IF I BELIEVE HIM.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.135
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
RIGHT NOW.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.886
{\an8}- OKAY, SO WHAT DID I DO?
TELL ME!

12:00.970 --> 12:02.680
{\an8}- TELL ME!
I DON'T KNOW!

12:02.763 --> 12:03.389
{\an8}- PLEASE,
WHAT THE [bleep] HAVE I DONE?

12:03.472 --> 12:05.641
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S HIM?

12:05.724 --> 12:06.976
{\an8}- WHAT YOU WANT?

12:07.059 --> 12:08.394
{\an8}[bleep] YOU AND
[bleep] BELIEVE

12:08.477 --> 12:09.687
{\an8}WHOEVER THE [bleep]
YOU WANT.

12:09.770 --> 12:11.480
{\an8}I'M DONE WITH THIS [bleep].
[bleep] DONE.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.858
{\an8}FINISHED.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.530
{\an8}- IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT, BRO?

12:19.613 --> 12:20.614
{\an8}HEARD A LOT OF YELLING.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.700
{\an8}- SAME BULL[bleep],
DIFFERENT DAY.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.670
{\an8}- I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

12:34.753 --> 12:35.796
{\an8}- I'M SORRY, TOO.

12:35.880 --> 12:36.881
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS
WITH HER,

12:36.964 --> 12:37.965
{\an8}GO RIGHT AHEAD.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.217
{\an8}DO I? [bleep] HER.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.886
{\an8}- GIVE ME YOUR PURSE!

12:41.969 --> 12:43.345
{\an8}- LET'S GO.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.889
{\an8}NICOLE IS SMASHED RIGHT NOW.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.308
{\an8}NICOLE!

12:47.391 --> 12:49.351
{\an8}I DON'T NEED YOU TO GET ARRESTED
FOR THIS [bleep].

12:52.813 --> 12:54.523
{\an8}- OKAY, SO WHAT DID I DO?
TELL ME!

12:54.607 --> 12:55.608
{\an8}- TELL ME!
I DON'T KNOW!

12:55.691 --> 12:57.151
{\an8}- WHAT HE [bleep]
HAVE I DONE?

12:57.234 --> 12:58.527
{\an8}- YEAH, THAT'S HIM?

12:58.611 --> 12:59.820
{\an8}- [bleep] THAT [bleep].
I'M DONE WITH THIS [bleep].

12:59.904 --> 13:02.364
{\an8}- YOU ALL RIGHT, BRO?
HEARD A LOT OF YELLING.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.824
{\an8}- SAME BULL[bleep],
DIFFERENT DAY.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.786
{\an8}- TIME TO GO TO THE GYM.
YOU READY?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.872
{\an8}- YEAH, LET'S GO.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.373
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.541
{\an8}I GUESS, WHATEVER
HAPPENED IN MIAMI.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.667
{\an8}YOU KNOW, WE HAD ISSUES,

13:13.751 --> 13:14.710
{\an8}AND SHE'S BRINGING IT
INTO THIS HOUSE,

13:14.793 --> 13:16.212
{\an8}AND I'M GETTING
TIRED OF IT.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.339
{\an8}I JUST
NEED TO CLEAR MY HEAD.

13:18.422 --> 13:19.882
{\an8}- LIKE,
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.383
{\an8}I'M SURE YOU CARE
FOR THE GIRL,

13:21.467 --> 13:22.801
{\an8}BUT SHE'S DEFINITELY
BRINGING YOU DOWN.

13:22.885 --> 13:26.347
{\an8}- SHE'S NOT THE SAME PERSON
THAT I MET [bleep] LAST YEAR.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.224
{\an8}- YEP, THAT--
IT HAPPENS, DUDE.

13:28.307 --> 13:28.891
{\an8}- BUT YOU KNOW,
LIKE, I LOVE HER,

13:28.974 --> 13:29.850
{\an8}I WANT TO BE WITH HER.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.977
{\an8}I WANT TO BE
WITH THAT KIND OF GIRL.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.395
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO BE WITH
THAT PERSON THAT YOU KNEW.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.566
{\an8}THIS MAY NOT BE THAT GIRL,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

13:37.650 --> 13:40.069
{\an8}TAKE IT OUT ON THE GYM
RIGHT NOW.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.905
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

13:42.988 --> 13:44.448
{\an8}- ONE MORE.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.116
{\an8}- SAM ACCUSED ME
OF [bleep] AROUND,

13:46.200 --> 13:47.243
{\an8}BUT I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.160
{\an8}I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
SINCE MIAMI.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.080
{\an8}- THREE.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.206
{\an8}- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

13:52.289 --> 13:54.166
{\an8}I DON'T NEED TO DEAL
WITH THIS [bleep].

13:54.250 --> 13:55.084
{\an8}SHE'S A GROWN WOMAN.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.001
{\an8}SHE CAN MAKE
HER OWN DECISION.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.545
{\an8}SHE SHOULD HAVE
[bleep] PUSHED ME AWAY.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.879
{\an8}- ONE SHOT, COME ON!

13:58.963 --> 14:01.048
{\an8}- IT'S LIKE, WHY AM I DEALING
WITH SAM'S DRAMA?

14:01.131 --> 14:02.508
{\an8}- GOOD UPPER CUT.

14:02.591 --> 14:05.594
{\an8}- IT'S MIND-BOGGLING.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.055
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO WORK.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.890
{\an8}- NEITHER DO I.
I REALLY DON'T.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.183
{\an8}I'M NOT INTO IT TODAY.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.602
{\an8}"UM, CAN YOU HELP ME
PICK OUT SOMETHING FOR MY SHIRT?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.104
{\an8}WHAT SHOULD I GET?"

14:15.187 --> 14:16.647
{\an8}WHAT THE [bleep]
YOU THINK YOU SHOULD GET?

14:16.730 --> 14:18.524
{\an8}WHAT THE HELL DO I LOOK LIKE?

14:18.607 --> 14:19.900
{\an8}[bleep] DJ.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.569
{\an8}- [laughs]

14:21.652 --> 14:24.113
{\an8}- SAMANTHA!
GET YOUR NARROW ASS DOWN HERE!

14:24.196 --> 14:24.572
{\an8}WE GOTTA GO TO WORK!

14:24.655 --> 14:27.116
{\an8}- TOOTLES.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.117
{\an8}- SEE YOU GUYS.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.248
{\an8}THE GUIDOS ARE HERE!

14:34.331 --> 14:36.875
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
SAMMI SWEETHEART, NICOLE,

14:36.959 --> 14:38.794
{\an8}I GOT A LITTLE JOB
FOR YOU GIRLS.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.129
{\an8}- TWO AND ONE, RIGHT?

14:40.212 --> 14:42.298
{\an8}- YEAH, EXACTLY.
YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.550
{\an8}- YEP.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.510
{\an8}- I DON'T WANT TO WORK
WITH SAM.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.095
{\an8}IT'S NOT A FUN TIME.

14:48.178 --> 14:50.139
{\an8}- BANG THOSE OUT, GIRLS.

14:50.222 --> 14:52.308
{\an8}- WELL, THIS IS BORING.

14:52.391 --> 14:56.061
{\an8}- I DIDN'T KNOW
IF I WANTED TO REALLY APOLOGIZE

14:56.145 --> 14:57.813
{\an8}ON NICOLE
IN THE WORKPLACE

14:57.896 --> 14:58.981
{\an8}BUT, UM,
IT HAD TO COME OUT.

14:59.064 --> 15:00.482
{\an8}I OWED NICOLE
AN APOLOGY,

15:00.566 --> 15:03.193
{\an8}SO I TOLD HER
HOW I FELT.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.615
{\an8}I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY,

15:07.698 --> 15:10.242
{\an8}AND I AM SORRY FOR CUTTING
OUR FRIENDSHIP COMPLETELY,

15:10.326 --> 15:14.246
{\an8}AND IT'S DISGUSTING I DIDN'T
BELIEVE THE RIGHT THING,

15:14.330 --> 15:15.205
{\an8}BUT I AM SO WRONG,

15:15.289 --> 15:17.499
{\an8}AND YOU WERE SO RIGHT
THE WHOLE TIME,

15:17.583 --> 15:18.959
{\an8}AND JUST THANK YOU

15:19.043 --> 15:21.003
{\an8}FOR GOING ON YOUR--
FOR DOING SOMETHING.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.172
{\an8}- DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE WAITED FOR THAT?

15:23.255 --> 15:24.340
{\an8}I JUST WANTED TO--

15:24.423 --> 15:25.633
{\an8}- WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE,

15:25.716 --> 15:27.009
{\an8}SOMETIMES YOU DON'T
WANT TO SEE THE BAD,

15:27.092 --> 15:28.344
{\an8}AND YOU DON'T
WANT TO BELIEVE IT.

15:28.427 --> 15:29.637
{\an8}- YOU NEEDED TO KNOW.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.181
{\an8}AND EVEN WHEN YOU DID KNOW,
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.016
{\an8}- AND NOW I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.351
{\an8}- YOU'RE GONNA
STAY WITH THIS GUY?

15:35.434 --> 15:37.728
{\an8}THAT'S NOT OKAY.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.104
{\an8}- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.940
{\an8}NO MATTER WHAT,
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.359
{\an8}- THANK YOU.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.903
