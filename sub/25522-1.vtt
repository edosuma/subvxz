WEBVTT

02:16.845 --> 02:19.180
You sure Mama
won't notice we're gone?

02:19.681 --> 02:21.015
Better hope not.

04:57.547 --> 04:58.714
Hello?

05:11.436 --> 05:12.687
Preaker.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.106
Sure. Bye.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.825
-Am I in trouble?
-Always.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.452
But you don't need me
to tell you that.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.039
Wind Gap. What's it like?

06:14.833 --> 06:16.959
Okay, well...

06:18.045 --> 06:20.379
It's at the bottom of Missouri,
boot heel.

06:20.464 --> 06:21.797
Spittin' distance from Tennessee.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.008
I know where it is.
I asked what it's like.

06:24.676 --> 06:27.720
Small. Population's held
at 2,000 for years.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.597
Only real industry is hog butchering,

06:29.681 --> 06:32.600
so you got your old money
and your trash.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.185
Which one are you?

06:34.269 --> 06:36.437
Trash. From old money.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.232
What the hell's goin' on?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.234
In Wind Gap, or...?

06:42.319 --> 06:44.070
Your mom's still there,
right, Preaker?

06:44.154 --> 06:46.030
Mom? Yeah.

06:46.364 --> 06:47.656
Step-dad. They had a kid.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.283
Have. I don't really know her.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.327
-But you talk to 'em?
-Not if I can help it.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.495
Well, read the wires then.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.039
Jesus Christ, there was a murder there
last August.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.957
Little girl got strangled.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.251
I didn't know.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.296
Well, then you also don't know
that another one's missing now.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.632
Might be a serial.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.259
So, get your ass down
to that heel or whatever,

07:07.344 --> 07:09.095
and get me a story. Now. Today.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.721
We have murders here, Curry,

07:10.806 --> 07:12.264
so I don't see
why I gotta go to Wind Gap.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.016
Because nobody else is covering it.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.851
Do you remember that piece
in the Tribune last year?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.437
Guy who wrote about a killing
in his hometown?

07:18.522 --> 07:21.398
It made an impact,
because it was personal.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.775
People give a shit
when you give a shit.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.693
I'm not gonna win a Pulitzer
off of Wind Gap.

07:24.778 --> 07:25.820
You're not winning a Pulitzer

07:25.904 --> 07:27.404
'cause you're only half-good
at writing.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.864
This could change that.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.033
And I'm your boss.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.120
So, goodbye.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.839
All right, look, if you can't,
you can't, but it might be good.

07:46.341 --> 07:47.883
You know,

07:47.968 --> 07:50.553
flush some things out,
get you back on your feet.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.181
-And it's a good story.
-Yeah.

07:54.266 --> 07:56.433
Could be a damn good story
if you do it right.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.769
No pressure, right?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.437
Life is pressure.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.606
Grow up.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.027
Get the hell out of here.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.702
- Get out!
- Come on.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.374
Come on!

14:27.534 --> 14:28.575
Hi, Betty.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.044
That was Natalie's favorite color.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.591
Well, actually,
her folks said it was black,

15:25.675 --> 15:27.259
but that just seemed too grim.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.845
So, her second favorite.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.763
Little girls, first pink,

15:31.848 --> 15:34.057
and then it's purple, purple, purple.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.311
My two looked like grapes on legs
until they were 11 or so.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.521
It's a terrible thing.

15:39.772 --> 15:43.358
Practically the whole town
is out there, searching the woods.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.360
Chief Vickery, he set it up.

15:45.653 --> 15:46.862
You have children?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.448
-No.
-Well, I hate to say it,

15:49.532 --> 15:50.616
but right now, that's a blessing.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.535
I won't even let mine out of the house
to get the mail, even.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.037
You can't imagine.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.041
My girls, every night,
gettin' in bed with us.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.084
My husband, usually,
he wouldn't allow that,

16:01.169 --> 16:03.587
but now, not one of us
is gettin' a good night's sleep,

16:03.671 --> 16:05.255
but at least we know they're safe.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.094
Chief Vickery?

16:13.014 --> 16:14.640
Well, the thing is,

16:14.724 --> 16:17.434
I have no intention
of letting this thing get out, so.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.686
Yeah, I understand.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.815
This isn't going to be
a exploitative piece,

16:23.900 --> 16:24.941
more like a think piece

16:25.026 --> 16:28.320
on how something like this
can affect a town.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.952
If it makes you feel better,
I'm from here.

16:36.037 --> 16:37.496
Just up off Bluebird Circle.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.414
What's your name?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.041
Camille Preaker.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.418
My mom is Adora Crellin.

16:43.503 --> 16:47.506
She married out of her maiden name
about 30 years ago, to Alan...

16:47.590 --> 16:49.383
Crellin. Sure, okay.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.051
You're the...

16:52.261 --> 16:54.554
-You moved away.
-Yeah.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.226
Amma, she's your half-sister.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.561
Yeah.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.021
Damn.

17:06.943 --> 17:09.152
Jesus. Hot as hell in here, isn't it?

17:11.531 --> 17:14.366
- My kids give me that.
. Yeah, sorry.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.785
No, it's all right. Stress relief.

17:17.662 --> 17:19.204
Because of this case?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.668
Look, I just can't have you here,
Ms. Preaker.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.503
You know,
this story gets out in St. Louis,

17:26.587 --> 17:28.588
suddenly that's all
Wind Gap's known for.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.006
We're already "the hog killers."

17:30.091 --> 17:32.676
Some publicity could help,
get you some information.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.261
It's worked in other cases.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.348
I have a right to be here,

17:38.433 --> 17:41.101
and I will let you do your job
if you let me do mine.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.940
Fine.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.029
I got no comment.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.408
On Natalie Keene, fair enough.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.243
But what about the other girl?

17:59.203 --> 18:00.454
Ann Nash.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.790
I can ask around
and I can get the local version,

18:03.875 --> 18:05.876
or you can have a say
in what gets out.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.841
First girl,
Ann, found last August,

18:12.925 --> 18:15.427
strangled with a clothes line
and dumped in Falls Creek.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.803
Some hunters found her.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.431
That's all Vickery said? No leads?

18:19.515 --> 18:22.142
Well, I don't think he has any.
It's just the way he was...

18:22.518 --> 18:24.519
He was defensive.
Not like he was hiding something,

18:24.604 --> 18:26.980
more like he was pissed off
that he wasn't.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.273
Theory.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.484
Jesus, Curry, I just got here.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.237
Well, you have the police.
Get me some local stuff.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.739
I need facts and color.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.991
Fine. I will write you
a fuckin' rainbow.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.493
You know what I mean.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.537
If you think this place
has some small town charm...

18:42.622 --> 18:45.040
Well, give me local bleak,
then, kiddo,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.917
paint a goddamn picture.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.046
I'm goin' out to join
the search party now.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.548
Hopefully, we'll turn up
a dead little girl.

18:53.758 --> 18:54.925
Go get 'em.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.999
You lookin' for the search?

19:28.709 --> 19:30.627
-Yeah.
-That way.

19:31.295 --> 19:32.546
Thanks.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.966
Are you... You're...

19:37.134 --> 19:39.094
That reporter, right? From St. Louis?

19:41.597 --> 19:43.139
Well, that was fast.

19:43.599 --> 19:46.768
Gotta hand it to Wind Gap,
you guys do gossip like nobody else.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.938
That's 'cause this place
is so totally dead.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.650
"Dead."

19:55.152 --> 19:56.278
That's awful.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.698
Anyway, better get goin'
if you want to catch up.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.036
Thanks.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.555
Camille!

20:31.856 --> 20:33.356
Did you see something?

20:37.278 --> 20:38.403
No.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.739
You with the search?

20:41.115 --> 20:42.324
In a way.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.951
Detective Willis.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.621
You're not from here?

20:48.247 --> 20:49.581
No. You?

20:50.374 --> 20:51.499
Used to be.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.543
I'm up in St. Louis now.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.086
I'm with the Chronicle.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.756
A reporter. Great.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.634
Camille Preaker!

21:02.303 --> 21:03.803
Jackie O'Neill.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.472
Detective.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.349
Lord.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.359
I see you met our new detective.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.695
I'd like to take him home
and turn him into pound cake.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.281
Cover him in chocolate.
He's single, by the way.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.950
Hey, settle down.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.118
Aww!

21:27.578 --> 21:28.912
Come here. Look at you.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.915
Your mama didn't say
that you were in town.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.751
'Course, she's not
talkin' to me right now.

21:35.044 --> 21:36.294
I disappointed her again.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.255
Probably forgot to send her
a card or something, you know.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.758
-You know how that goes!
-I haven't seen her yet.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.176
I'm gonna head over there after this.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.928
She's gonna be thrilled.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.682
Baby girl, look at you.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.601
What about you, are you well?

21:52.269 --> 21:54.854
You know, well as I can be.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.232
Pretty grim around here.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.276
I'm in charge of refreshments
for the guys.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.028
It's the least I can do.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.406
You want a sweet tea?

22:04.490 --> 22:07.033
I got sweet tea
with a little bit of a kick in it.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.119
No one should face all this
without a little kick.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.204
I'm fine. I'm on the job.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.039
You still workin' for that newspaper?

22:13.124 --> 22:15.834
Yeah, that's why I'm here, actually.
I'm writing a story.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.671
Yeah, those girls...

22:20.589 --> 22:23.425
I see you, when you were the same age.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.844
And it just makes me so sad.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.596
So much has gone wrong.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.266
I just can't make sense of it all.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.686
You mind if I quote you on that?

22:36.063 --> 22:37.188
Yeah, I suppose so.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.857
If you think anyone
would be interested.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.026
You are nothing
if not interesting, Jackie.

22:44.155 --> 22:45.488
I'm glad you're home.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.615
We'll see.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.662
Beauty, beauty, beauty.

22:54.415 --> 22:55.582
Preacher.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.543
My Lord, Camille Preaker.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.962
It has been a long time, girl.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.338
Yeah, it has.

24:28.509 --> 24:30.635
Mama said
she saw a ghost once.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.848
Mama says a lot of things.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.517
You don't believe her?

24:38.269 --> 24:39.769
I don't know.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.982
I'm not scared of them ghosts.
Are you?

24:44.900 --> 24:47.193
It's stupid
to be scared of stuff that's not real.

24:47.361 --> 24:49.320
What if, after you die,

24:49.572 --> 24:52.824
part of you goes to heaven,
but part of you stays here?

24:52.908 --> 24:55.493
Just to look after stuff, you know?

24:55.661 --> 24:57.412
See how things turn out

24:57.496 --> 24:59.372
for you, for Mama?

24:59.540 --> 25:01.958
Stop that.
That kind of talk is for quitters.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.376
Are you a quitter?

25:03.460 --> 25:05.128
-No.
-Say it.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.255
I'm not a quitter.

25:08.257 --> 25:09.883
Why are you mad at me?

25:13.596 --> 25:14.888
Camille?

25:20.019 --> 25:22.395
Goodness. Is something the matter?

25:23.731 --> 25:25.356
No, Mama, not at all.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.276
I'm just in town on business.

25:28.402 --> 25:31.321
Business. I didn't expect you.

25:31.864 --> 25:35.116
My house is not up to par
for visitors, I'm afraid.

25:36.243 --> 25:37.577
Looks just fine.

25:39.121 --> 25:41.164
Come on inside. Goodness.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.377
Can I get you something to drink?

25:46.629 --> 25:48.963
Alan and I are having amaretto sours.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.506
I'll just have
what you're having, thanks.

25:50.591 --> 25:51.633
We're in back.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.968
It's nice and cool now
with the breeze.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.138
Where are you stayin'?

25:58.849 --> 25:59.933
Well, it's funny you should ask.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.559
I was hoping that I could

26:01.644 --> 26:03.645
stay here for a few days.

26:11.195 --> 26:13.613
I just wish you'd phoned.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.699
I would have known, had dinner ready.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.326
Go say hello to Alan.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.912
Alan? Camille's here.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.206
Who?

26:23.874 --> 26:25.166
Camille.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.088
- Hi.
- Hello, there!

26:32.174 --> 26:34.008
Adora didn't say you were comin'.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.177
She didn't know. I'm sorry to...

26:37.346 --> 26:39.514
Just drop in like this.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.100
My editor sent me down
last minute, so...

26:42.977 --> 26:44.269
Your editor.

26:44.812 --> 26:48.189
-Did he?
-Yeah, I'm here about Natalie Keene,

26:48.274 --> 26:50.316
and that other little girl, Ann Nash.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.151
To write a story?

26:53.529 --> 26:55.196
Yes, Mama. It's a newspaper.

26:55.281 --> 26:58.199
Camille, I just don't understand
why a young woman like you

26:58.284 --> 27:00.451
would want to even
dwell on such things.

27:00.536 --> 27:03.413
Well, it could be an important story,
and being from here...

27:03.497 --> 27:04.872
I knew those children.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.085
I'm having a very hard time,
as you can imagine.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.219
And to... To write about it?

27:18.429 --> 27:21.472
"Wind Gap Murders its Children."
Is that what you want people to think?

27:21.557 --> 27:23.766
Well, it can be really helpful
to get information out.

27:23.851 --> 27:24.892
People come forward...

27:24.977 --> 27:27.103
I just can't have
that kind of talk around me.

27:27.187 --> 27:28.646
Hurt children. Just...

27:29.064 --> 27:31.232
Don't tell me what you're doing,
what you know.

27:31.317 --> 27:35.236
While you're here, I'll just pretend
you're on summer break.

27:43.245 --> 27:44.537
How's Amma?

27:44.621 --> 27:45.705
Amma?

27:49.251 --> 27:50.710
She's managing,

27:51.170 --> 27:54.047
you know,
the children have a curfew now.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.757
She's asleep already.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.926
-Why do you ask?
-Just being polite.

27:59.178 --> 28:01.304
We do that in the big city, too,
you know.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.481
I'll go make sure
your room is in order.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.566
Thanks.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.493
Well, this is my new toy.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.999
Your old room
is the best for visitors.

28:30.084 --> 28:31.542
It has that nice bath.

28:53.524 --> 28:54.941
Good night, Camille.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.151
Good night, Mama.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.498
See? It's a heart.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.167
You're high.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.918
What?

29:56.253 --> 29:58.171
It's something kids at school say.

29:58.881 --> 30:01.632
It's, like, "You're crazy."

30:03.260 --> 30:04.552
You're high.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.972
No, you are. It's a chicken.

30:08.056 --> 30:09.515
Clearly a chicken.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.850
Where?

30:11.226 --> 30:13.102
See? There's its eyes, okay,

30:13.187 --> 30:14.395
and there's its face...

30:18.859 --> 30:21.068
Mama! Mama!

31:26.802 --> 31:28.052
Camille?

31:28.720 --> 31:30.346
I heard you were back in town.

31:30.430 --> 31:33.015
How about we catch up over
your finest well whiskey?

31:33.350 --> 31:35.476
Well whiskey? No. Screw the well.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.813
This is a homecoming drink,

31:39.773 --> 31:41.649
and this homecoming drink

31:43.110 --> 31:44.402
is on me.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.571
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

31:46.655 --> 31:47.989
So, how about the place?

31:48.657 --> 31:50.908
It's mine now.
Yeah, I bought it from those guys.

31:50.993 --> 31:52.535
They moved out to California.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.829
We don't really get that type
around here anymore.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.330
Whatever they call 'em now.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.457
I mean, I got nothing
against 'em, but...

31:59.418 --> 32:01.752
They would have tried to eat
that one down there alive.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.921
Always recruitin'.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.424
Still a smart-ass.

32:06.508 --> 32:07.592
Still a dumbass.

32:07.676 --> 32:10.886
Dumbass with the hottest
karaoke club in seven counties.

32:10.971 --> 32:13.097
Shit, you oughta see this place
on Friday nights.

32:13.181 --> 32:14.515
Tell me, what's your song?

32:16.268 --> 32:17.560
Ring of Fire.

32:17.894 --> 32:20.771
Nice! Bohemian Rhapsody.
I crush it.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.984
Gay bait down there
seems a little young to be drinkin'.

32:25.402 --> 32:27.737
Yeah, yeah.
I'm cuttin' him some slack.

32:28.572 --> 32:29.947
It's John Keene.

32:30.032 --> 32:31.198
John Keene, Natalie's brother?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.701
Yeah, yeah. Poor son of a bitch.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.494
He's takin' it really hard.

32:36.038 --> 32:37.997
-Excuse me for a sec, okay?
-Yeah.

32:38.582 --> 32:41.250
Ms. Preaker. At Sensors.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.085
Yeah.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.630
What, is this your spot?

32:46.965 --> 32:48.674
This what you do?
You come here and you drink,

32:48.759 --> 32:51.927
and you just, I don't know,
dream about the one that got away?

32:54.723 --> 32:56.599
Sarcasm. Thank you.

32:57.225 --> 33:00.811
Most I get from your hometown pals
is a sugary passive-aggression.

33:01.396 --> 33:02.730
Well, that is our specialty.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.690
We just nod and smile

33:04.775 --> 33:07.151
until the out-of-town asshole
leaves us alone.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.861
Is that what I am?

33:08.945 --> 33:10.279
Where are you from?

33:11.073 --> 33:12.323
Kansas City,

33:12.616 --> 33:14.659
by ways of a lot of other places.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.244
So, yes on the "out-of-town,"

33:17.329 --> 33:19.413
and jury's still out on "asshole."

33:20.791 --> 33:22.375
How long have you worked on the case?

33:23.585 --> 33:25.252
Since the Keene girl.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.213
Vickery called for backup.

33:27.297 --> 33:28.881
I think he regrets it now.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.092
He doesn't like my style.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.260
Which is?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.471
Not his, I guess.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.808
At least I'm investigating.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.352
You don't think he is?

33:43.355 --> 33:45.106
-Funny girl.
-Come on.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.941
You know I'm gonna get the story
one way or another.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.901
Wouldn't you rather be
in control of the conversation?

33:48.985 --> 33:50.027
That's a good line.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.445
Maybe, but it's true.

33:54.574 --> 33:58.369
Well, like you were about to go talk
to young Keene over there.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.037
Is that who that is?

34:00.122 --> 34:03.290
Reporters aren't supposed to talk
to minors without parental permission.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.209
Jesus, I was just gonna hit on him.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.504
Well, that's different.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.007
So, is he a suspect?

34:12.092 --> 34:14.093
-You know I can't answer that.
-So he is.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.803
Everybody's a suspect right now.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.680
So, that's it.
You don't have any leads? Nothin'?

34:17.764 --> 34:19.306
Camille, can we just talk?

34:20.809 --> 34:22.935
I'm starved
for some city folk conversation.

34:23.019 --> 34:24.520
I'll ask you a question
about your life,

34:24.604 --> 34:26.063
you can ask about mine...

34:26.314 --> 34:28.774
Yeah. I don't really do that. Chat.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.610
Got it. Okay.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.696
Well, Camille...

34:34.573 --> 34:35.948
Enjoy your evening.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.743
Detective.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.372
Shit.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.923
Come on.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.731
Shit. Fuck.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.414
Camille?

37:34.669 --> 37:36.045
Mornin'.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.969
I just left my bag
in the car, so I was...

37:45.305 --> 37:46.555
Camille.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.350
I'm happy you're here...

37:52.520 --> 37:55.856
But, please, don't embarrass me.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.191
Not again.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.068
What?

37:59.569 --> 38:01.862
When you're here, everything you do

38:02.155 --> 38:03.739
comes back on me.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.908
Understand?

38:07.369 --> 38:08.661
Honestly, no.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.455
'Cause that might have been true
when I was a kid,

38:11.539 --> 38:12.915
but I'm an adult now.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.167
Not in Wind Gap.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.379
When you're here, you're my daughter.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.840
You can move away and forget,
but I can't.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.592
You don't know
the people here anymore.

38:23.677 --> 38:24.760
Yeah, believe me, I do.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.763
I haven't heard from you in months!

38:29.516 --> 38:31.642
And you just show up

38:32.602 --> 38:36.230
askin' such horrible,
morbid questions,

38:36.439 --> 38:38.190
stirring everyone up,

38:38.274 --> 38:40.067
staying out all night.

38:41.444 --> 38:42.486
Look, Mama, please.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.238
Stop, Mama. Look, stop.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.864
I'm sorry, okay?

38:46.992 --> 38:48.158
I'm sorry.

38:49.035 --> 38:51.370
Honestly, it was nothin'.
I just... I went for a drive.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.372
I was beat, so I...

38:53.456 --> 38:55.749
I pulled over, to be safe.

38:57.168 --> 38:58.544
It was stupid, so...

38:58.878 --> 39:00.462
You spent the night in the car?

39:03.550 --> 39:05.426
Did anyone see you?

39:05.635 --> 39:07.136
No. No one saw me.

39:09.556 --> 39:11.557
-Look, and about my story...
-I shouldn't have said anything.

39:11.641 --> 39:12.766
You know...

39:13.727 --> 39:16.645
You know I can't have
that kind of talk around here.

39:22.235 --> 39:23.944
I just want you
to understand that I...

39:24.029 --> 39:26.655
I didn't come back
to cause any problems.

39:26.740 --> 39:28.157
That wasn't my intention.

39:38.293 --> 39:39.793
Are you ready for some eggs?

40:11.284 --> 40:12.659
Thank you.

40:29.427 --> 40:31.512
Bobby. Come on.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.490
Sorry, Kool-Aid's all I got left.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.075
No, that's fine. Thank you.

40:53.201 --> 40:54.952
And thank you for speaking with me.

40:56.246 --> 40:57.496
With all the attention on Natalie,

40:57.580 --> 41:00.582
I think it's important
to remind people that...

41:02.043 --> 41:03.335
Ann was first.

41:04.045 --> 41:05.212
Yeah.

41:06.965 --> 41:08.382
Um...

41:09.759 --> 41:11.677
We should talk in the bedroom.

41:18.726 --> 41:19.935
Thank you.

41:27.277 --> 41:29.111
-You mind if I just set this...
-Yeah.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.200
Just...

41:39.622 --> 41:41.165
Ann, she'd been...

41:42.167 --> 41:43.959
Riding her bike all last summer,

41:45.003 --> 41:46.170
just ride around, around the block.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.213
My wife wouldn't
let her go no further,

41:48.298 --> 41:50.591
'cause we're protective parents,
like anybody.

41:51.259 --> 41:52.676
Sure, you kept tabs on her.

41:52.927 --> 41:54.261
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.470
So...

41:56.514 --> 41:57.723
So, just 'fore school starts up,

41:57.807 --> 42:00.559
she begs to ride over
to her friend Emily's house.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.144
Not far...

42:02.896 --> 42:05.355
But we usually wouldn't let her,
but she's whinin'.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.443
So, my wife finally gets fed up
and says, "Fine."

42:11.529 --> 42:12.946
Ann never got there.

42:13.990 --> 42:15.157
To Emily's.

42:16.451 --> 42:18.702
She left around 7:00, must've been...

42:19.746 --> 42:21.622
8:00, 'fore we realized.

42:22.290 --> 42:23.498
I'm sorry.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.836
Somewhere, in those ten blocks,
they got her.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.088
My wife...

42:31.758 --> 42:33.425
Could never forgive herself.

42:34.761 --> 42:36.845
I would love a chance
to speak with her?

42:37.639 --> 42:38.847
Your wife.

42:43.603 --> 42:45.896
She's at the store.

42:47.273 --> 42:48.482
I'll ask, but she's not...

42:48.566 --> 42:49.691
This thing...

42:50.485 --> 42:52.152
She hasn't been the same.

42:54.739 --> 42:55.906
Daddy?

42:55.990 --> 42:57.783
I'm still hungry. Can I make...

42:57.867 --> 42:59.993
What do you do
when that door's closed, Amanda?

43:01.537 --> 43:03.288
-I knock?
-You knock.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.503
Next time you forget,
it's goin' on your chart.

43:12.006 --> 43:13.215
Go.

43:17.887 --> 43:19.429
She knows better.

43:20.306 --> 43:23.183
Thing about Ann,
she was plain, but she was smart.

43:23.268 --> 43:26.061
She did for herself.

43:26.646 --> 43:27.938
Um...

43:28.022 --> 43:31.066
So, were you here when it happened?

43:31.567 --> 43:33.777
When Ann left for Emily's?

43:34.070 --> 43:36.488
I was driving back
from my office in Hayti.

43:36.572 --> 43:38.198
It's about an hour away...

43:38.449 --> 43:40.492
Don't write that down.
Why are you writing that down?

43:40.785 --> 43:41.952
I'm sorry?

43:42.328 --> 43:44.413
People 'round here don't like us
'cause we keep to ourselves,

43:44.497 --> 43:45.706
but that doesn't mean I hurt my kid.

43:45.790 --> 43:47.874
No, no, no,
I wasn't suggesting that, Mr. Nash.

43:47.959 --> 43:50.752
I was just wondering if you had
a chance to see her that day.

43:55.008 --> 43:56.550
In the mornin'.

43:57.719 --> 44:00.595
But four kids, it gets hectic. I...

44:01.472 --> 44:03.432
I don't remember what we said.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.311
You know what I think?

44:08.354 --> 44:09.730
A faggot did it.

44:09.814 --> 44:10.856
'Cause he didn't rape her.

44:10.940 --> 44:12.733
And the cops say that's unusual.

44:12.817 --> 44:15.152
I'd say it's the only blessin' we got.
I'd rather him...

44:15.903 --> 44:17.696
Kill her than rape her.

44:22.577 --> 44:23.869
That's her.

44:24.412 --> 44:25.704
See?

44:31.085 --> 44:32.669
She was a willful thing.

44:32.962 --> 44:34.296
Night before that picture was took,

44:34.380 --> 44:35.714
my wife wants
to put her hair in rollers,

44:35.798 --> 44:37.090
and Ann wasn't having any of it,

44:37.175 --> 44:40.177
so she chops her hair off instead.

44:48.311 --> 44:49.686
She gave him hell.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.607
She gave that guy hell.

44:53.691 --> 44:55.275
So you got a feeling about him.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.651
His wife wasn't around.

44:56.736 --> 44:59.529
It looks like she left.
He was kind of cagey about it.

44:59.614 --> 45:01.615
Could be embarrassed.
Private, you know.

45:01.699 --> 45:03.033
Yeah.

45:03.618 --> 45:05.077
He says that

45:05.620 --> 45:07.162
people are pointing the finger at him.

45:07.246 --> 45:08.872
Do you think he's a suspect?

45:10.291 --> 45:13.043
I don't know.
I mean, he's odd, for sure.

45:13.669 --> 45:15.921
But, I'll do some diggin'.

45:16.005 --> 45:18.215
Good, good. Follow it up.

45:20.385 --> 45:22.386
Things at home, they're all right?

45:24.305 --> 45:25.597
Camille?

45:25.807 --> 45:28.308
-At home?
-Yeah, with your family.

45:29.352 --> 45:31.311
Yeah, I mean, they're peachy.

45:31.687 --> 45:32.729
They're great.

45:34.107 --> 45:35.482
Okay, well,

45:35.566 --> 45:38.026
you call me if you need me.

45:38.152 --> 45:39.277
I will.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.071
Tell Eileen I said hello.

45:41.531 --> 45:43.156
-Will do.
-All right.

45:43.241 --> 45:44.950
-Okay. Bye-bye.
-Bye.

45:49.539 --> 45:51.123
She sends her best.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.460
You'd better be right.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.629
Just because you've seen Dr. Phil

45:57.713 --> 45:59.172
doesn't make you a real doctor.

46:13.354 --> 46:14.521
Hey!

46:17.066 --> 46:18.650
You can't take that stuff.

46:19.444 --> 46:21.027
We knew those girls.

46:21.988 --> 46:23.572
Natalie was his sister.

46:25.199 --> 46:26.616
John, right?

46:27.618 --> 46:29.995
Yeah. No, they didn't
mean anything by it.

46:30.288 --> 46:32.747
We just wanted something
to remember them by, that's all.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.084
What's the point of lettin'
all the flowers die and stuff, and...

46:37.879 --> 46:39.921
It's not just the families, you know.

46:41.340 --> 46:42.716
We're all sad.

46:52.185 --> 46:54.895
Help! We need help!

46:58.483 --> 47:00.984
"The wicked is thrust down
by his wrongdoing,

47:01.068 --> 47:03.612
"but the righteous has a refuge
when he dies..."

47:47.823 --> 47:49.616
Thanks, man. I got this.

48:26.988 --> 48:30.073
Looks like you got your serial,
Detective. Congratulations.

48:31.367 --> 48:33.159
This fuckin' business.

48:35.788 --> 48:38.415
The things you wish for, and then...

48:40.626 --> 48:42.335
And then it happens.

48:42.837 --> 48:44.129
Yeah.

48:44.714 --> 48:46.548
It's never real until it is.

48:49.802 --> 48:51.845
You should let me drive you home.
You're shaking.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.054
Not for long.

48:54.765 --> 48:57.684
-I'll give you a lift.
-No, no, I'm... I'm fine.

48:58.394 --> 48:59.978
I brought my car,

49:00.521 --> 49:01.563
and I'm fine.

49:01.647 --> 49:03.356
You can get it in the morning.

49:03.441 --> 49:04.941
It's no trouble at all.

49:05.026 --> 49:06.610
Is Bob Nash a suspect?

49:06.861 --> 49:08.945
I was gonna ask Vickery before.

49:09.155 --> 49:11.156
He won't tell you, like I won't.

49:12.408 --> 49:13.950
And how about John Keene?

49:14.035 --> 49:15.452
Jesus.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.249
Why? Did you find something?

49:21.834 --> 49:23.335
I'll show you mine.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.631
This isn't... I'm not gonna...

49:31.135 --> 49:32.719
Let's table the games.

49:34.430 --> 49:36.640
At least until that little girl's
in the morgue.

49:57.745 --> 50:00.080
Where were you? I was worried sick.

50:00.164 --> 50:02.791
I had to give the police a statement.

50:04.377 --> 50:06.461
-I was there when they found her.
-Don't.

50:07.546 --> 50:10.048
-That's enough.
-You asked me where I was.

50:10.424 --> 50:13.718
I suppose
it was foolish to hold out hope.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.430
I'm exhausted. I'm gonna lie down.

50:17.515 --> 50:19.891
Bob Nash called.
He said you spoke to him.

50:19.975 --> 50:22.435
That's not right, Camille,
not right at all.

50:22.520 --> 50:24.938
Aren't these families in enough agony
without you

50:25.022 --> 50:26.773
-hashing over it?
-Mama. Mama.

50:26.857 --> 50:30.235
I can't... I can't talk right now.
Okay? I need to sleep.

50:30.319 --> 50:32.904
I don't think
I'll sleep for a million years.

50:33.114 --> 50:34.739
It's just so awful.

50:35.074 --> 50:37.492
Ann and Natalie? In our nothin' town?

50:38.327 --> 50:40.036
It could happen to any of us.

50:40.121 --> 50:41.413
Amma.

50:43.124 --> 50:44.374
Yeah.

50:50.548 --> 50:52.757
You've been around, though.
Why haven't you said hello?

50:52.842 --> 50:54.551
I can be shy, I guess.

50:55.344 --> 50:56.636
I don't know.

50:58.222 --> 51:00.014
Well, I never
would have recognized you.

51:00.099 --> 51:03.309
Adora stopped sending
those Christmas pictures a while back.

51:03.686 --> 51:07.230
Amma, you are not to leave
this house alone. Understand?

51:07.314 --> 51:08.606
It's not safe.

51:08.691 --> 51:11.776
I need to know
where you are at all times.

51:11.861 --> 51:13.361
But we already have to be in by 9:00.

51:13.446 --> 51:14.821
- It's not enough, sweet.
- No.

51:14.905 --> 51:17.699
Let's not make rules tonight, Adora.

51:17.783 --> 51:20.326
We'll all be more sensible
in the morning, I think.

51:21.203 --> 51:23.121
Come look at my dollhouse.

51:36.343 --> 51:38.052
Needs reupholstering now.

51:38.137 --> 51:41.514
Mama changed her color scheme
from gold to gray.

51:48.773 --> 51:50.398
You promised you'd take me
to the fabric store

51:50.483 --> 51:52.275
so I could make
new coverings to match.

51:52.359 --> 51:55.570
I know I did, sweet.
I've just been so distracted.

51:57.823 --> 51:59.407
Isn't it beautiful?

52:00.701 --> 52:02.869
This dollhouse is my fancy.

52:03.954 --> 52:07.332
Yeah, well, looks like you've done
a really nice job with it.

52:07.416 --> 52:09.876
- I try. Thank you.
- Yeah.

52:10.836 --> 52:12.796
I'm gonna go get some rest.

52:14.548 --> 52:16.716
I put your dinner
in the icebox for later.

52:16.801 --> 52:18.968
-You have to eat.
-Okay, thanks.

52:19.136 --> 52:20.887
I'll go up with you.

52:21.806 --> 52:24.140
I think I'll rest a while too, Mama.

52:27.186 --> 52:29.479
Let the girl rest.

52:34.610 --> 52:36.694
You knew it was me, didn't you?

52:37.363 --> 52:38.822
When you saw me around town.

52:39.198 --> 52:40.448
Not at first.

52:41.367 --> 52:42.742
Not for sure.

52:43.577 --> 52:45.078
Then I just...

52:46.080 --> 52:48.331
It was interesting
seeing what you were like

52:48.833 --> 52:50.667
before this, you know?

52:51.126 --> 52:52.752
You're not mad, are you?

52:52.878 --> 52:53.962
No.

52:54.046 --> 52:55.839
Just surprised, I guess.

52:58.467 --> 53:01.261
Have you gone in to Marian's room?

53:02.429 --> 53:03.680
No.

53:05.474 --> 53:06.975
It's like a museum.

53:08.060 --> 53:09.853
Mama keeps it that way.

53:09.937 --> 53:11.229
Yeah.

53:12.940 --> 53:14.732
I miss her sometimes.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.317
Marian.

53:16.944 --> 53:18.903
Even though I didn't know her.

53:20.447 --> 53:22.991
Well, Adora talks about her
all the time.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.493
Or at least alludes to her.

53:26.787 --> 53:28.162
Was she perfect?

53:29.748 --> 53:31.416
She was, wasn't she?

53:31.834 --> 53:34.294
No. She was close.

53:37.464 --> 53:39.549
But now we could be sisters.

53:42.469 --> 53:45.430
Everyone always says you were
the prettiest girl in Wind Gap.

53:45.514 --> 53:47.974
-No, Amma.
-You are.

53:48.767 --> 53:50.393
You're so pretty.

53:51.562 --> 53:52.854
And you won't tell?

53:52.938 --> 53:55.106
Mama would go bananas if she,
you know,

53:55.190 --> 53:56.608
saw me in my civvies.

53:56.942 --> 53:58.651
Is that what you call them?

53:59.320 --> 54:01.112
You know how she is.

54:01.614 --> 54:05.074
I'm just her little doll to dress up.

54:05.451 --> 54:07.076
Easier to go along.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.495
You never did, though.

54:10.414 --> 54:12.665
Mama says you were incorrigible.

54:12.750 --> 54:14.125
I bet she does.

54:15.210 --> 54:16.836
I'm incorrigible, too.

54:18.422 --> 54:20.006
Only she doesn't know it.

54:25.471 --> 54:26.763
We're alike.

54:27.765 --> 54:29.390
I knew we would be.

55:59.356 --> 56:00.565
Get off of me!

56:05.696 --> 56:07.030
Camille!

56:10.617 --> 56:11.909
Get off!

56:12.077 --> 56:13.536
Get off of me!
