00:07.280 --> 00:09.880
<i>Previously on
"Queens of Mystery"...</i>

00:09.880 --> 00:11.400
The auctioneers are coming

00:11.400 --> 00:13.120
to collect "The Tell-Tale Heart"
tomorrow

00:13.120 --> 00:15.000
whether you like it or not.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.800
Not if I have anything to do
with it, they won't.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.800
I don't even own
a baseball bat.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.040
Step out of the car,
please, sir.

00:21.040 --> 00:24.360
I-I have to be somewhere.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.160
Someone beat Henry up
last night

00:26.160 --> 00:27.480
and stole the manuscript.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.240
Damn police.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.560
But I'm more interested
in what the thief left behind --

00:31.560 --> 00:33.720
a solitary black feather
just like the one

00:33.720 --> 00:35.160
in Mum's safe deposit box.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.600
What if The Raven is back?

00:36.600 --> 00:38.840
We've got to get down there.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.440
There's something wrong
with your Aunt Jane.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.080
Everyone be quiet.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.960
I knew something wasn't right.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.520
Why are your aunts here, Stone?

00:49.520 --> 00:51.120
Aunt Jane was the one
who found the body.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.520
Of course she did.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.160
I should've said
something earlier.

00:55.160 --> 00:56.720
I killed Professor Rhineheart.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.040
She's lying.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.320
Because I killed
Professor Rhineheart.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.160
Dr. Lynch.
Matilda.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.720
What can you tell me
about the head wound?

01:04.720 --> 01:06.480
I'd say the victim
almost certainly fell backwards

01:06.480 --> 01:08.200
onto the corner
of the display case.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.720
So they <i>are</i> both lying.

01:09.720 --> 01:13.720
Yes, I've got the proof.
It's gonna cost you.

01:13.720 --> 01:17.280
You need to speak
to Sally Capstan.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.480
she interned
for Professor Rhineheart.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.080
Reynolds.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.120
<i>There was a time
in Matilda's life</i>

02:37.120 --> 02:40.840
<i>when the harsh reality
of attending the local mortuary</i>

02:40.840 --> 02:44.320
<i>was offset by the excitement
of seeing local GP</i>

02:44.320 --> 02:48.720
<i>and pathologist
Dr. Daniel Lynch.</i>

02:48.720 --> 02:52.000
<i>Sadly, that time had passed.</i>

02:54.760 --> 02:56.160
Reynolds?

02:58.320 --> 02:59.880
Stone!

02:59.880 --> 03:01.160
Sorry, yes.

03:01.160 --> 03:03.160
She said the name twice
before she died.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.040
PC Foster is compiling
a list of anyone

03:05.040 --> 03:06.920
with that name
who lives nearby.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.200
Dr. Lynch, cause of death?

03:09.200 --> 03:11.440
By the skin pallor and traces
of dried saliva

03:11.440 --> 03:13.960
in the corners of the mouth,
I'd say she was poisoned.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.560
I'll know more after the PM.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.800
Put a hurry up on it.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.200
If it is the same killer,

03:18.200 --> 03:19.640
we need to stop them
before they strike again.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.880
Sir.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.480
Carry on, Doc.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.240
Reynolds.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.120
I know, it means
nothing to me either.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.280
I had a one-night stand
with a drummer of that band

03:55.280 --> 03:57.280
we saw at the rec that time.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.200
Weren't they called Reynolds?

03:59.200 --> 04:00.640
Raymonds.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.920
And she was the lead guitarist,
not the drummer.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.360
And it was a fight,
not a one-night stand.

04:05.360 --> 04:07.520
Oh, yeah.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.440
Oh, God, I loved the '80s.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.920
Oh, I meant to ask.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.520
Who did you sell my Brian Flynn
first edition to?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.760
Your what?

04:14.760 --> 04:15.960
"The Mystery
of the Peacock's Eye."

04:15.960 --> 04:17.600
It's been on display for weeks.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.840
I didn't sell it.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.840
Maybe I moved it.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.920
Oh, I don't know.
I'll find it later.

04:23.920 --> 04:28.520
Hello, I've come to pick up
a returns package.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.080
- Hi, Henry.
- You're keeping yourself busy.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.680
I do a bit of delivery work
on the side.

04:33.680 --> 04:36.840
Mm, but it's not your only
other job, though, is it?

04:36.840 --> 04:39.560
I mean, from what I discovered
yesterday, you have three.

04:39.560 --> 04:40.760
Don't know what you mean.

04:40.760 --> 04:43.040
Right.
Come on, Henry.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.280
We know you're sleeping
on the job.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.120
Spill the beans.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.800
Thanks.

04:54.800 --> 04:59.000
Alison run off with
another man about a year ago.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
It's been tough, you know,
especially for the girls

05:03.000 --> 05:06.320
growing up without a mum,
and it wasn't made any easier

05:06.320 --> 05:08.240
with all the debt
she left behind.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.840
- So you took on extra work.
- Yeah.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.240
Except that still wasn't enough,
so I took on a third job

05:14.240 --> 05:17.320
and I used the shift
at the Heritage House to sleep.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.640
All worked like a charm
until the other night.

05:22.200 --> 05:25.160
As soon as I woke up,
I knew something was wrong.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.680
I knew if word got out that
I was sleeping on the job,

05:30.680 --> 05:32.480
I'd get fired.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.840
So I made it look like

05:33.840 --> 05:36.160
I caught the intruders
in the act

05:36.160 --> 05:38.280
and that they tied me up.

05:40.360 --> 05:42.160
I never meant
to knock myself out.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.160
That was an accident.
I was desperate.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.680
If I lose the job,
I lose the house.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.040
And while it was only a robbery,

05:53.040 --> 05:56.040
I thought the insurance company
could take the hit.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.240
Except it wasn't just a robbery.

05:58.240 --> 06:00.160
By the time I learned that,

06:00.160 --> 06:02.720
I couldn't come clean without
getting into more trouble.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.120
Right, you need to go to
the station and ask for Matilda.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.560
Tell her everything
you've just told us

06:08.560 --> 06:11.000
and pray that Inspector Thorne
doesn't want to charge you

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
with perverting
the course of justice.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.200
I will. I promise.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.320
<i>Although yawning is said
to be contagious,</i>

06:19.320 --> 06:21.600
<i>Jane Stone couldn't help
but wonder</i>

06:21.600 --> 06:24.960
<i>if her and Henry's recent
bouts of oscitation</i>

06:24.960 --> 06:27.400
<i>weren't somehow connected.</i>

06:27.400 --> 06:30.360
I do hope Matilda and Inspector
Thorne go easy on Henry.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.000
Me too.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.800
It can't be easy raising
those children on his own.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.400
Oh, I'm so sorry, I wasn't
looking where I was going.

06:38.840 --> 06:41.640
- That's okay.
- My fault.

06:41.640 --> 06:42.880
Ugh!

06:47.720 --> 06:51.000
Has to be around here
somewhere.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Come on, Cat, think.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.200
- There we go.
- Thank you.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.760
Bye-bye!

07:06.000 --> 07:07.840
Thieving cow.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.240
He's up to something.
I know it.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.840
Oliver McGorrie,
he's just clumsy.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.800
I'm not so sure.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.800
You're alright here for a while,
aren't you?

07:18.800 --> 07:20.920
Why?
Where are you going?

07:20.920 --> 07:22.120
Meddling.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.640
But Matilda told us not to.

07:25.640 --> 07:29.600
<i>The dictionary defines meddling
as interfering in something</i>

07:29.600 --> 07:32.080
<i>that is not one's concern.</i>

07:32.080 --> 07:33.880
<i>But, thought Jane Stone,</i>

07:33.880 --> 07:36.080
<i>if the activity
was directly connected</i>

07:36.080 --> 07:38.240
<i>to why she kept yawning...</i>

07:38.240 --> 07:42.120
Then I wouldn't
technically be meddling.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.280
Microfiche records?

08:01.280 --> 08:02.720
Of the local paper.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.200
I've been to <i>
The Wildemarsh Watchmen</i>

08:04.200 --> 08:06.040
looking for articles
about The Raven,

08:06.040 --> 08:08.920
but all their back copies went
missing when they moved offices.

08:08.920 --> 08:12.360
They said you'd have copies
on something called microfiche.

08:12.360 --> 08:16.000
It's funny, no one's asked me
about microfiche for months,

08:16.000 --> 08:19.040
then two people request the same
articles in as many days.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.040
Come with me.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.240
Someone else was asking
about The Raven?

08:25.240 --> 08:28.880
Yes, Sally Capstan.
She asked me yesterday.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.880
Microfiche are miniature
photographs of documents.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.360
You need a staff ID card
to activate a search.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.840
You can use mine.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.440
It'll give you a list

09:12.440 --> 09:14.960
of where the physical
microfiche files are located.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.440
Do you remember the exact files
Sally asked for yesterday?

09:18.440 --> 09:21.920
Um, I should still have
a printout here somewhere.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.520
Yes, here it is.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.160
You wait here.
I'll bring you the files.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.240
You in here, Stone?

09:36.240 --> 09:38.240
Sir.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.840
I've had a call you've been
pestering the local paper.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.440
I was after articles about
The Raven,

09:42.440 --> 09:44.080
but they couldn't help.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.720
The librarian's getting me
their microfiche copies now.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.960
There's, um...

09:50.960 --> 09:53.520
something you need to know
about the Raven case.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.200
Yes, sir?

09:55.200 --> 09:59.280
Sorry to interrupt, but those
Raven files you asked for,

09:59.280 --> 10:00.920
I put them back in the drawer

10:00.920 --> 10:03.280
when Sally had finished
with them,

10:03.280 --> 10:04.880
but now they've gone.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.680
The thing is, Natasha...

10:18.280 --> 10:23.000
Natasha, darling...

10:23.000 --> 10:25.480
this isn't easy for me
to admit.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.880
That is, I've been thinking
about it a lot

10:28.880 --> 10:31.880
and I'm not sure
we aren't maybe,

10:31.880 --> 10:37.520
you know, rushing into
this whole marriage thing.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.800
Oh, she's gonna kill me.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.040
- Come in.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.440
I, um...

10:49.200 --> 10:51.200
I need a favor.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.680
You think whatever it was
Sally Capstan found

10:57.680 --> 11:00.320
on the missing microfiche
is what got her killed.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.360
It's a possibility, sir.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.080
Have the room dusted for prints.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.560
Find out who's been in here
who shouldn't have been.

11:06.560 --> 11:09.360
<i>But the sight
of her aunt Jane's brooch</i>

11:09.360 --> 11:13.280
<i>already told Matilda
everything she needed to know.</i>

11:13.280 --> 11:14.480
Sir...

11:14.480 --> 11:15.920
I mean, sir.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.280
Just now, you said
there was something

11:21.280 --> 11:24.200
I should know
about the Raven case.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.000
Did I?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.680
Um...

11:27.680 --> 11:29.680
Nope, it's gone.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.520
Couldn't have been important.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.120
Carry on, Sergeant.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.200
Right, I want
an explanation for this.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.520
I'm sorry. I let you down.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.200
You haven't seen my aunts,
have you?

11:57.200 --> 11:59.040
No, sorry.

11:59.040 --> 12:00.440
I want a word with you.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.000
Well, that will have to wait.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.720
We have the test results
for the coffee.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.440
What coffee?

12:05.440 --> 12:08.200
The other day, I borrowed some
coffee from the security office.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.720
I'm sorry, Henry.
I should have asked first.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.720
I've been really tired
ever since.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.440
When I saw that Henry
keeps yawning, too,

12:15.440 --> 12:18.040
I couldn't help but think
there might be a connection.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.200
I ran some tests on the coffee
and found it was laced

12:20.200 --> 12:22.040
with two different types
of sedative.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.920
So whoever stole the manuscript
wanted to make sure

12:24.920 --> 12:27.480
that Henry was out cold
before they broke in.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.560
No wonder you fell asleep,
Henry.

12:29.560 --> 12:31.680
Still doesn't excuse me lying
about the break-in.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.280
No, but given
your circumstances,

12:33.280 --> 12:35.640
this may be understandable.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.440
Does that mean
I'll get to keep my job?

12:38.440 --> 12:41.560
That depends on whether Sergeant
Stone wants to press charges.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.880
Considering Henry's home situation,

12:43.880 --> 12:45.240
Inspector Thorne and I
have agreed

12:45.240 --> 12:47.440
to let him off
with a caution.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.120
Then it's decided.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.520
If you'd excuse us, Sergeant,
I would like to show Henry

12:52.520 --> 12:55.120
my plans for a new
security system.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.840
Has anyone seen
Victoria Durrell?

12:56.840 --> 12:59.240
Oh, yes, I just saw her
heading home.

12:59.240 --> 13:03.240
Matty, I found out something
about Oliver McGorrie.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.040
Right, that's it, I want a word
with all three of you now.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.160
And, Aunt Jane, there had better
be a blooming good reason

13:09.160 --> 13:11.120
why I found your brooch
at the exact spot

13:11.120 --> 13:12.920
important evidence was stolen.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.120
I didn't even realize
I'd lost it.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.040
Actually, Matilda,
I did need to talk to you

13:17.040 --> 13:19.440
about Sally Capstan's
postmortem results.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.240
Why don't we wait for you
by the gates?

13:21.240 --> 13:24.160
Yeah, give you a chance
to cool your jets.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.920
Make it quick.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.120
I don't think I have ever
seen Matilda so angry.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.840
Well I'm not hanging around here
to get bawled out by my niece.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.120
I'm off to find
Victoria Durrell.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.600
I'll come with you.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.960
No, wait, I need your help
tailing Oliver McGorrie.

13:39.960 --> 13:42.760
I caught him searching
Sally Capstan's locker.

13:42.760 --> 13:44.040
I wonder what for.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.440
Don't know.
We need to find out.

13:47.440 --> 13:51.040
Sally Capstan was poisoned
with a lethal dose of camphor.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.040
Camphor?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.680
It's used as an embalming fluid.

13:53.680 --> 13:55.040
There'd be a plentiful
supply on-site

13:55.040 --> 13:57.440
for preserving artifacts.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.280
Thanks for letting me know.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.120
I did also want to talk to you
about something more personal...

14:05.040 --> 14:07.840
But it can wait.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.840
Where have they gone now?

14:24.320 --> 14:26.920
I know you're in there,
Victoria.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.280
Victoria?

15:04.240 --> 15:05.880
Victoria!

15:07.960 --> 15:09.480
Get back!

15:11.360 --> 15:13.080
Don't do it, Victoria.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.720
I'm sorry.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.600
Ah, you are quite
the bibliophile.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.200
Bibliomaniac.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.080
A bibliophile loves books.

15:28.080 --> 15:32.040
Bibliomania is an obsessive
compulsive disorder

15:32.040 --> 15:34.840
involving the collecting
and hoarding of books.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.440
Oh, well, I stand corrected.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.160
It's why I became a librarian.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.960
I thought being around books all
day would satisfy my cravings.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.920
Mm, and how's that
working out for you?

15:45.920 --> 15:50.960
I have spent my entire
inheritance on books.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.560
When the money ran out,

15:52.560 --> 15:56.360
I started stealing them
from wherever I could.

15:56.360 --> 16:00.480
I'd been stealing from
Heritage House for years.

16:00.480 --> 16:04.280
Ah, but now Matilda
wants you to do a stock take.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.000
I'd been trying
to put the books back,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.680
but there are too many of them.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.280
I knew it wouldn't be long
before the thefts

16:09.280 --> 16:10.680
were discovered.

16:10.680 --> 16:14.160
So you decided to destroy
the evidence?

16:14.160 --> 16:18.160
Except that proved
harder than I thought.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.880
The missing manuscript.

16:46.160 --> 16:49.560
Well, I never had Victoria
Durrell down as a murderer.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.120
Remember this number --

17:23.120 --> 17:29.360
0161 496 0972.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.880
- Right. That's right. Bye.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.200
What was the number?

17:47.200 --> 17:52.200
0161 496 0972.

17:53.920 --> 17:55.120
You're a wonder,
do you know that?

17:55.120 --> 17:57.000
Am I?

17:57.000 --> 18:01.160
<i>Antiquities and Fine Art
Department, can I help you?</i>

18:01.160 --> 18:02.760
- So that's Oliver's game. <i>
- Hello?</i>

18:02.760 --> 18:05.960
It might also explain
how I lost my brooch.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.520
How do you mean?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.920
Let's go and find Henry Wade.
I'll explain on the way.

18:30.920 --> 18:34.240
Did Professor Rhineheart catch
you stealing the manuscript?

18:34.240 --> 18:36.320
Is that why you killed him?

18:36.320 --> 18:37.920
I didn't kill anybody.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.360
So, you're denying you stole
the manuscript?

18:42.040 --> 18:45.440
Alright, yes,
I stole the manuscript.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.440
But I stole it five years ago.

18:47.440 --> 18:50.120
I replaced the original
manuscript with a facsimile.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.320
Whoever broke into
Heritage House

18:52.320 --> 18:53.960
stole the forgery.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.160
So...

19:07.160 --> 19:10.160
For all his so-called expertise,

19:10.160 --> 19:11.840
Professor Rhineheart
never noticed

19:11.840 --> 19:14.080
the manuscript was a fake.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.520
But I knew the auctioneers

19:15.520 --> 19:17.200
would spot it
as soon as they picked it up.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.040
Which was the real reason
you were so desperate

19:19.040 --> 19:21.640
to prevent the sale.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.520
When my petition didn't work,

19:23.520 --> 19:26.520
I knew I had to put
the real manuscript back.

19:26.520 --> 19:28.000
I thought if I got in
extra early,

19:28.000 --> 19:30.480
I could make the swap
without anyone noticing.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.160
Except by then,
it had been stolen.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.920
I can't tell you
how relieved I was.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.640
Heritage House would get
the insurance money,

19:39.640 --> 19:42.640
the thief got what he deserved,
and best of all,

19:42.640 --> 19:44.640
I got to keep
the original manuscript.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.040
Until I insisted
on a stock take.

19:49.280 --> 19:53.520
I've been panicking ever since
I'd be found out.

19:53.520 --> 20:00.760
I'm sorry for what I did,
but I can't help myself.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.480
Will I go to prison?

20:05.480 --> 20:09.400
Forgery, theft,
obstruction of justice...

20:09.400 --> 20:11.240
it's highly likely.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.440
Do you think they'll let me work
in the prison library?

20:23.520 --> 20:25.960
Thanks so much for doing this,
Henry.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.600
There.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.720
We need to find Matilda.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.800
What am I looking at?

20:38.800 --> 20:41.280
Security footage
from this morning.

20:41.280 --> 20:44.240
Oliver McGorrie stole my brooch

20:44.240 --> 20:46.640
and planted it beside
the stolen microfiche

20:46.640 --> 20:48.120
to put you off his scent.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.760
- Why?
- Money.

20:49.760 --> 20:52.720
We caught him calling a company
that specializes

20:52.720 --> 20:56.520
in stolen artifacts
and insurance rewards.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.040
Right.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.720
Are we going to speak to Oliver?

20:59.720 --> 21:01.960
<i>We</i> aren't going anywhere.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.400
You three have done enough
for one day.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.080
I've borrowed this
from the recording booth

21:07.080 --> 21:08.400
so you don't have
to go back there.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.440
If you want to make yourselves
useful,

21:10.440 --> 21:12.640
finish off
Aunt Jane's audio book.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.440
Anyone would think
she didn't want our help.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.320
Come clean or I'm arresting you

21:24.320 --> 21:27.840
for perverting
the course of justice.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.440
You're a former police officer

21:29.440 --> 21:31.520
who investigates
the theft of rare books

21:31.520 --> 21:34.320
for an antiques recovery agency.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.760
I've just come off the phone
with your employer.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.440
I lied when I said I was
a retired civil servant.

21:51.240 --> 21:52.840
The disguise,
the whole clumsy thing,

21:52.840 --> 21:55.280
it was so people
wouldn't suspect who I was.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.080
I wanted to tell you,
but I was determined

21:57.080 --> 21:59.920
to be the one to catch
Professor Rhineheart.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.640
Professor Rhineheart?

22:01.640 --> 22:04.200
In recent years, there's been
a number of rare book thefts

22:04.200 --> 22:07.000
from famous libraries
and museums.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.800
All looked like inside jobs,

22:08.800 --> 22:11.840
but no one individual worked
at all the sites.

22:11.840 --> 22:14.160
The link had to be someone
that made regular visits

22:14.160 --> 22:15.640
to each of the locations.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.040
Like a famous professor
researching his new book.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.400
Precisely.

22:19.400 --> 22:22.080
When I heard he was visiting
Wildemarsh,

22:22.080 --> 22:24.920
I knew he was planning on
stealing "The Tell-Tale Heart."

22:24.920 --> 22:27.320
So you volunteered to work
at Heritage House

22:27.320 --> 22:29.040
in the hope of
catching him in the act.

22:29.040 --> 22:33.200
Yes, that was the plan, except
he must've sussed out who I was.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.560
I'm certain Rhineheart planted
the baseball bat in my car,

22:36.560 --> 22:39.440
then made a false call
to the police.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.240
The period that I was detained
in custody

22:41.240 --> 22:43.880
was all the time he needed
to steal the manuscript,

22:43.880 --> 22:45.200
make his getaway.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.520
But Professor Rhineheart
didn't get away.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.840
He was murdered.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.040
I figured by his accomplice.

22:51.040 --> 22:53.480
See, my theory is that
Rhineheart targeted sites

22:53.480 --> 22:55.480
where he knew someone
who could help him.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.760
Sally Capstan.

22:56.760 --> 23:00.080
As I see it,
Sally killed Rhineheart

23:00.080 --> 23:02.160
and then took off
with the manuscript.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.560
See, I made it my mission to
find out where she'd hidden it,

23:04.560 --> 23:06.840
but first I had to delay
your investigation

23:06.840 --> 23:08.880
and get those nosey aunts
of yours out of the way.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.880
Which is why you stole
my aunt Jane's brooch.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.760
I saw Sally ask
Victoria for help

23:13.760 --> 23:15.200
with the microfiche.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.200
After she was killed,
I knew you'd follow up

23:17.200 --> 23:18.960
on her movements.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.680
So I planted your aunt's brooch
where I knew you'd find it.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.080
And I was hoping to get
your aunts to back off.

23:24.080 --> 23:26.880
You clearly don't know my aunts.

23:26.880 --> 23:30.640
But if Sally killed Professor
Rhineheart, who killed her?

23:30.640 --> 23:32.440
That's what I haven't been
able to figure out,

23:32.440 --> 23:37.440
but it has to have something
to do with the robbery somehow.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.400
What if Sally didn't kill
the professor?

23:40.400 --> 23:43.800
What if there were two robberies
that night?

23:43.800 --> 23:45.640
It would explain why
Henry's coffee

23:45.640 --> 23:48.600
was laced with two different
kinds of sleeping draught --

23:48.600 --> 23:52.920
both sets of thieves trying to
ensure he was asleep on the job.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.760
Professor Rhineheart
and Sally Capstan

23:54.760 --> 23:56.640
could've tried
stealing the manuscript

23:56.640 --> 23:58.960
but ran into someone else
doing the same thing.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.160
Be ironic if it was true.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.280
Professor Rhineheart,
Sally Capstan -- both writers,

24:04.280 --> 24:07.240
both dead trying to steal
an old book.

24:07.240 --> 24:11.040
Authors of their own demise,
literally.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.280
What?

24:13.280 --> 24:15.480
Authors.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.280
That's what Sally
was trying to tell me.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.480
I don't understand.

24:18.480 --> 24:20.680
Reynolds is an author.

24:20.680 --> 24:24.400
I don't have time to explain.
I've got a library to search.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.400
Rameck...

24:35.400 --> 24:37.800
Resnick...

24:37.800 --> 24:39.440
uh...

24:39.440 --> 24:40.640
Reynolds.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.360
Thank you, George.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.400
Robin Brunswick.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.600
The 31st.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.440
That was a week ago.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.320
<i>And it was in that
moment that Matilda realized</i>

25:28.320 --> 25:32.240
<i>she'd been fooled
not by one person, but by two.</i>

25:32.240 --> 25:34.240
It was a double double bluff.

25:44.440 --> 25:46.240
<i>Thorne here.
Leave a message.</i>

25:46.240 --> 25:48.240
Inspector Thorne,
it's Sergeant Stone.

25:48.240 --> 25:50.560
Meet me at Heritage House.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.360
I know who the murderers are.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.000
WOMAN #
It didn't have to come to this.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.800
You could have let it be.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.000
WOMAN #But you should have
told me the truth.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.600
I'd have understood.

26:09.600 --> 26:13.360
WOMAN #Truth?
You weren't ready for the truth.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.760
No one ever is.

26:14.760 --> 26:16.560
WOMAN #
Oh, I can handle the truth.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.240
It's the lies that kill me.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.440
WOMAN #Oh, yeah.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.920
WOMAN #Watch out!
He's got a knife.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.800
- WOMAN #Come here!

26:31.040 --> 26:33.040
Oliver?

26:33.040 --> 26:35.080
- Oh, I'm sorry, I thought --
What?

26:35.080 --> 26:37.400
That someone might be
stealing my jewelry?

26:37.400 --> 26:39.360
Ah, that's what I came
to apologize for.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.960
It was wrong of me
to plant your brooch

26:40.960 --> 26:42.480
inside the microfiche vault.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.880
I am sorry.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.400
I explained everything
to your niece,

26:45.400 --> 26:46.800
and it seemed to help.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.960
- Help how?
I'm not sure.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.520
She said something about
authors and about

26:51.520 --> 26:54.040
what Sally was trying to
tell her, and then she left.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.640
Did she say
where she was going?

26:55.640 --> 26:57.760
The Heritage House library,
I think.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.560
The library...

26:59.560 --> 27:01.760
Authors.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.960
Yes, of course.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.560
Come on, we've got
to help Matilda.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.720
Which of you killed
Professor Rhineheart?

27:26.040 --> 27:28.440
Does it matter?

27:28.440 --> 27:30.160
It was an accident.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.280
You should have told us
the truth.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.080
We'd have understood.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.280
Like the police did last time,
you mean?

27:38.760 --> 27:40.280
I read your file.

27:40.280 --> 27:43.240
You were convicted
of first-degree murder.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.840
It was self-defense.

27:45.840 --> 27:48.640
He beat me for years.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.960
Do you know the worst part?

27:50.960 --> 27:55.360
Your sentence doesn't stop
when you're released.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.560
Prison leaves its mark.

27:57.560 --> 28:00.920
People can smell
the time on you.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.640
It wasn't like that with Rob.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.240
He saw me for who I really was.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.840
And when I got out,

28:07.840 --> 28:10.480
he was the only one
who'd give me a second chance.

28:12.560 --> 28:16.040
It wasn't difficult
to fall in love with him.

28:16.040 --> 28:20.240
When did you know
the manuscript was a forgery?

28:20.240 --> 28:22.840
Not until a few days ago.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.480
I was cleaning

28:24.480 --> 28:27.480
as Professor Rhineheart
was studying the manuscript.

28:27.480 --> 28:31.680
He left the room, and I couldn't
resist taking a closer look.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.680
I'm not an expert.

28:33.680 --> 28:35.280
I shared a cell with a forger,

28:35.280 --> 28:39.880
and she taught me enough to know
I was looking at a fake.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.240
I knew the auctioneers would
spot it straightaway

28:42.240 --> 28:44.920
and they would cancel the sale.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.000
We couldn't let that happen.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.400
Heritage House needed the money
from the auction to stay open.

28:50.400 --> 28:52.520
So you decided to drug
Henry's coffee

28:52.520 --> 28:55.240
to ensure the coast was clear,
steal the manuscript,

28:55.240 --> 28:58.240
and use the insurance money
to save Heritage House.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.480
All we needed to do
was leave a few false leads

29:00.480 --> 29:02.560
to make it look like
The Raven was back.

29:02.560 --> 29:05.000
Which is why I found
Robin Brunswick's name on a list

29:05.000 --> 29:08.400
of people who'd accessed
the stolen microfiche files.

29:08.400 --> 29:12.120
He was researching The Raven
for what clues to leave.

29:12.120 --> 29:15.080
We'd just finished
setting everything up

29:15.080 --> 29:18.080
then Professor Rhineheart
turned up.

29:18.080 --> 29:20.080
Rhineheart went mad.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.840
It was all Rob could do
to defend himself.

29:36.120 --> 29:37.440
He's dead.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.720
Rob panicked.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.040
He wanted to call the police,

29:41.040 --> 29:44.720
but I knew from experience
that if the truth came out,

29:44.720 --> 29:48.320
we were both going to prison.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.920
So we hid Rhineheart
in the grandfather clock

29:50.920 --> 29:52.520
and agreed to come back
the following night

29:52.520 --> 29:54.160
to dispose of him.

29:58.280 --> 30:02.200
Except in the meantime,
my Aunt Jane found the body.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.600
I knew you would eventually find
my criminal record

30:05.600 --> 30:07.880
and I'd fall under suspicion,

30:07.880 --> 30:10.480
which is why we had to confess.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.880
A double double bluff.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.160
You each gave false confessions,

30:16.160 --> 30:18.960
neither of which matched with
how Rhineheart really died,

30:18.960 --> 30:21.160
so as to place yourselves
above suspicion.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.000
And it would have worked

30:23.000 --> 30:25.600
if it hadn't have been
for Sally Capstan.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.960
Rob.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.800
It's over, Kaz.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.240
Run.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.800
Get as far away
from this place as you can.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.080
I'll keep the sergeant busy.

30:45.640 --> 30:48.520
Sally knew you had stolen
the manuscript, didn't she?

30:48.520 --> 30:50.280
She was Rhineheart's lookout.

30:50.280 --> 30:52.160
She saw us leaving together.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.880
After the robbery, Sally went
looking in the microfiche vault

30:54.880 --> 30:56.640
for information about The Raven,

30:56.640 --> 30:59.800
and that's when she found proof
that you'd done the same --

30:59.800 --> 31:01.680
proof she used
to blackmail you with.

31:01.680 --> 31:02.960
She threatened to show
the police

31:02.960 --> 31:04.560
unless I cut her in
on the profits.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.200
You never told me!

31:10.120 --> 31:12.760
You poisoned Sally Capstan.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.360
Killing Sally was the only way

31:14.360 --> 31:16.760
you could guarantee
the truth wouldn't come out.

31:16.760 --> 31:20.400
And with Sally out of the way,
you knew you'd be in the clear.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.880
Say it's not true, Rob!

31:21.880 --> 31:24.440
What was I supposed to do?!

31:24.440 --> 31:27.360
She'd have ruined everything!

31:47.720 --> 31:49.120
Rob, stop it!

31:51.600 --> 31:53.040
Let her go!

31:55.760 --> 31:58.640
Stop it, Rob!

32:10.360 --> 32:11.800
- Rob!
- Aah!

32:11.800 --> 32:13.000
Rob!

32:22.640 --> 32:24.680
Rob...

32:30.840 --> 32:33.160
Put pressure on the wound.
Call an ambulance!

32:33.160 --> 32:37.760
Don't...help me.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.680
I don't want
to go back to prison.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.840
No, no, no, no. No, please.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.680
I love you.

32:58.600 --> 32:59.840
Karen.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.280
Matty.

33:22.440 --> 33:26.000
Any deeper and that
could have been serious.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.200
All done.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.520
I'll pop by tomorrow,

33:28.520 --> 33:30.520
check if that dressing
needs changing.

33:58.040 --> 34:00.840
So, all that stuff Sally told me

34:00.840 --> 34:03.040
about the NDA
in the auction house...

34:03.040 --> 34:06.440
A cover story to explain why
she pretended not to know him.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.960
How's the shoulder, Sergeant?

34:07.960 --> 34:10.160
- Fine, sir, thank you.
- Quick question.

34:10.160 --> 34:12.880
The feather, the rope --
they were all red herrings?

34:12.880 --> 34:15.280
Robin and Karen wanted the
theft to look like The Raven,

34:15.280 --> 34:16.680
throw everyone off the scent.

34:16.680 --> 34:18.160
They'd heard rumors
about The Raven,

34:18.160 --> 34:19.760
but they hadn't got the details.

34:19.760 --> 34:22.040
Sally discovered Robin was
searching microfiche files

34:22.040 --> 34:24.520
for information on The Raven
and put two and two together.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.760
So then Sally hid
the incriminating microfiche

34:26.760 --> 34:29.800
in a book by an author named
Reynolds for safekeeping.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.200
Right, well, I'm glad
that clears that up.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.440
Carry on, Sergeant.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.640
Ladies.

34:52.640 --> 34:54.320
Still volunteering?

34:54.320 --> 34:56.560
Ah, Sergeant Stone.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.400
The council
has asked me to stay on

34:58.400 --> 35:01.640
to supervise the sale
of the real manuscript.

35:01.640 --> 35:04.440
Look, I'm sorry about trying
to fix your aunts up.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.840
No hard feelings, eh?

35:05.840 --> 35:07.240
Not as long as
you hand over the rest

35:07.240 --> 35:08.680
of the stolen microfiche.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.440
I thought Sally Capstan
took them all?

35:10.440 --> 35:13.080
As far as I know, she only took
the one I found in the book.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.200
Well, sorry, Sergeant.
It wasn't me.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.000
<i>As Aunt Jane
admired her brooch,</i>

35:30.000 --> 35:32.880
<i>the Raven badge
found at Edith Bryant's house</i>

35:32.880 --> 35:35.400
<i>was among the many
corvus-related items</i>

35:35.400 --> 35:38.880
<i>that her niece was
struggling to pin down.</i>

35:38.880 --> 35:41.080
Another date with George?

35:41.080 --> 35:43.160
Open mic night.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.400
Oh, what's the matter?

35:44.400 --> 35:46.000
I'd have thought
you'd like that.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
I do, but it's just
this Raven thing.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.960
It's still bugging me.

35:50.960 --> 35:53.200
The police files were destroyed
in a flood,

35:53.200 --> 35:56.040
the newspaper reports vanished,
and all but one

35:56.040 --> 35:58.440
of the microfiche files
have been stolen.

35:58.440 --> 36:01.640
I thought Oliver McGorrie
took them.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.280
He says not.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.880
It's like someone wants
to erase all proof

36:05.880 --> 36:08.640
The Raven ever existed.

36:08.640 --> 36:11.680
Can't help wondering
if Mum's disappearance

36:11.680 --> 36:13.400
isn't somehow connected.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.520
What do you think?

36:17.520 --> 36:23.360
I think sometimes
when bad things happen,

36:23.360 --> 36:28.560
to try to make sense of those
things, we make connections.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.520
Yeah, maybe you're right.

36:35.840 --> 36:37.680
Enjoy your date.

36:39.680 --> 36:41.320
Thank you.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.240
<i>While Jane Stone hated herself
for keeping the truth</i>

36:57.240 --> 37:01.760
<i>from her beloved niece,
Dr. Daniel Lynch</i>

37:01.760 --> 37:06.560
<i>was about to hate himself
for telling the truth.</i>

37:06.560 --> 37:10.280
Oh, Beatrice, what do you think?

37:15.520 --> 37:17.160
Daniel!

37:19.960 --> 37:21.440
Could you give us a minute?

37:21.440 --> 37:24.040
Of course.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.200
What are you doing here?

37:26.200 --> 37:28.000
You know it's bad luck
for the groom

37:28.000 --> 37:30.400
to see the dress
before the big day.

37:43.680 --> 37:47.040
There's not going to be
a big day, is there?

37:47.040 --> 37:49.120
I'm sure you'll have one.

37:50.840 --> 37:52.720
One day.

37:52.720 --> 37:55.320
Just not with me.

38:01.080 --> 38:05.920
It's, uh, Matilda, isn't it?

38:08.200 --> 38:09.840
I'm sorry.

38:11.840 --> 38:13.480
Do you love her?

38:15.600 --> 38:18.200
I think so.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.200
Yes.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.800
Then you'd better go tell her.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.320
You're not angry.

38:24.320 --> 38:27.920
Oh, I'm working up to angry.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.360
I'm currently in self-loathing.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.680
Thank you.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.600
Will Madam be taking the dress?

38:56.240 --> 38:58.640
Inspector Thorne.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.160
Books.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.560
You want to sell some books?

39:01.560 --> 39:03.240
Stolen books.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.920
- You stole some books?
- Yes.

39:04.920 --> 39:06.480
No!

39:06.480 --> 39:09.120
No, these are your books.
Victoria Durrell stole them.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.680
I wanted you
to have them back.

39:10.680 --> 39:14.000
Oh, thank you, that's very
kind of you, Inspector.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.960
I-It's Derek, remember?

39:15.960 --> 39:19.520
That's very kind of you, Derek.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.040
Was there something else?

39:25.040 --> 39:27.520
Um...no.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.760
'Night.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.600
I'd like to ask you
out to dinner.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.000
Did you say something?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.600
No.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.400
Thank you, everybody.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.320
Okay, next up we've got
a first-timer -- be kind.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.120
Terry Faster.

40:10.280 --> 40:12.920
- It's Foster.
- That's what I said.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.880
Terry?

40:26.040 --> 40:29.960
This is an anonymous
poem I found called "Raven."

40:32.840 --> 40:35.040
Rank rebel raven,

40:35.040 --> 40:36.960
all colored as a coal,

40:36.960 --> 40:39.080
oh, crow untrue.

40:39.080 --> 40:43.640
Flaps he into flight,
fanning on the wind.

40:43.640 --> 40:48.560
High is he upon his heart
to hearken tidings.

40:48.560 --> 40:53.560
Croaks he for comfort,
for carrion he finds,

40:53.560 --> 40:58.040
cast upon the cliffs
where rotting corpses lay.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.680
Inspector Thorne.

41:06.520 --> 41:09.720
Filling full his belly,
full soon slips yesterday,

41:09.720 --> 41:13.240
strife and storm,
forgotten his captain's charges.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.800
Mrs. Bryant?

41:14.800 --> 41:18.360
Left in the coffer,
the raven wrecking forth.

41:20.440 --> 41:22.080
Mrs. Bryant!

41:25.320 --> 41:26.840
Matilda, is everything alright?

41:26.840 --> 41:28.640
- Yeah.
- You sure?

41:28.640 --> 41:30.640
- Yeah, everything's fine.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.640
<i>It is a central tenet of any
detective's investigation</i>

42:00.640 --> 42:02.840
<i>that a single lie discovered</i>

42:02.840 --> 42:07.200
<i>is enough to create doubt
in every truth expressed.</i>

42:07.200 --> 42:09.000
<i>What else, wondered Matilda,</i>

42:09.000 --> 42:11.600
<i>had Inspector Thorne
lied about?</i>

42:11.600 --> 42:15.600
<i>And more importantly, why?</i>

42:15.600 --> 42:18.120
It's that sometimes,

42:18.120 --> 42:20.960
you find the right person,
you just...

42:20.960 --> 42:24.600
know, don't you?

42:27.240 --> 42:30.320
Sorry, what were you saying?

42:30.320 --> 42:32.160
I said you just know.

42:34.640 --> 42:38.120
<i>And while Matilda's mind raced
with a thousand questions</i>

42:38.120 --> 42:39.520
<i>for Inspector Thorne...</i>

42:39.520 --> 42:41.440
Thanks for opening up late,
Harry.

42:41.440 --> 42:43.840
My pleasure, Ms. Stone.

42:43.840 --> 42:46.040
<i>...her aunts were doing
everything in their power</i>

42:46.040 --> 42:48.800
<i>to ensure the answer
to the one question</i>

42:48.800 --> 42:54.200
<i>that had haunted Matilda since
childhood remained a mystery.</i>

43:25.880 --> 43:28.280
If Matilda ever finds out...

43:28.280 --> 43:30.120
We have to pray she doesn't.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.280
<i>Prayers were also in
Dr. Daniel Lynch's thoughts</i>

43:35.280 --> 43:39.400
<i>as he raced to declare
his undying love for Matilda --</i>

43:39.400 --> 43:42.760
<i>prayers Matilda would see past
his foolish engagement</i>

43:42.760 --> 43:44.560
<i>to Natasha.</i>

43:48.160 --> 43:52.600
<i>Prayers that in this instance
were not to be answered.</i>

43:56.600 --> 44:01.200
<i>So, as George seized the day,
others in Matilda's orbit</i>

44:01.200 --> 44:05.600
<i>were left to contemplate life's
many missed opportunities.</i>

44:11.880 --> 44:14.680
<i>The opportunity
to have grasped love</i>

44:14.680 --> 44:16.680
<i>while it was still in reach.</i>

44:23.000 --> 44:25.880
<i>Or conversely,
to have stopped love</i>

44:25.880 --> 44:28.280
<i>slipping through your fingers.</i>

44:33.120 --> 44:35.240
<i>To have admitted past mistakes</i>

44:35.240 --> 44:38.080
<i>before those mistakes
were exposed.</i>

44:48.040 --> 44:50.840
<i>Or to have confessed
to the truth</i>

44:50.840 --> 44:56.400
<i>before being forced
down a path of lies.</i>

44:56.400 --> 44:59.200
<i>Opportunities that,
once missed,</i>

44:59.200 --> 45:02.040
<i>may never present
themselves again.</i>

45:05.120 --> 45:08.520
<i>At least,
not without intervention</i>

45:08.520 --> 45:11.720
<i>from a very unexpected
quarter.</i>
