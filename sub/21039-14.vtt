using the Von Drake
Sensational Super-Sonar Beeper,

02:38.733 --> 02:40.317

02:40.442 --> 02:43.483
all the way down
on the bottom of the water.

A great big something!

of something underwater, Professor?

02:50.858 --> 02:52.317
The Super-Sonar Beeper

02:52.483 --> 02:57.233
makes sound waves that are bouncing off
of objects deep in the underwater.

Then, when those sound waves
are bouncing back to us,

03:00.650 --> 03:03.150
we can see how big
the objects are looking

03:03.233 --> 03:05.150
on this special screen.

03:05.275 --> 03:10.233
For example, that small blue triangle
might be a rock.

03:10.358 --> 03:14.150
And those wavy green things
could be seaweed.

03:14.275 --> 03:17.608
Uh, professor,
what about all them red dots?

03:17.733 --> 03:20.567
Is that the big something
you were talkin' about?

03:21.317 --> 03:24.900
Well now, that maybe could be
a school of fishies.

on the bottom of Mickey Lake.
