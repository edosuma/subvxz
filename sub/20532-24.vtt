¶¶

00:05.306 --> 00:09.308
<i> ¶¶</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:12.511
<i> ¶ I was a girl in the village</i>
<i> doing all right ¶</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:14.880
<i> ¶ Then I became</i>
<i> a princess overnight ¶</i>

00:14.882 --> 00:17.616
<i> ¶ Now I gotta figure out</i>
<i> how to do it right ¶</i>

00:17.618 --> 00:19.785
<i> ¶ So much to learn</i>
<i> and see ¶</i>

00:19.787 --> 00:22.521
<i> ¶ Up in the castle</i>
<i> with my new family ¶</i>

00:22.523 --> 00:25.224
<i> ¶ In a school that's</i>
<i> just for royalty ¶</i>

00:29.497 --> 00:32.698
<i> - ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶</i>
<i> - ¶ Sofia the First ¶</i>

00:32.700 --> 00:36.668
<i> ¶ I'm finding out what</i>
<i> being royal's all about ¶</i>

00:36.670 --> 00:38.670
<i>¶ Sofia the First ¶</i>

00:38.672 --> 00:42.841
<i> ¶ Making my way,</i>
<i> it's an adventure every day ¶</i>

00:42.843 --> 00:45.477
<i> - ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶</i>
<i> - ¶ Sofia ¶</i>

00:45.479 --> 00:51.550
<i> ¶ To show them all</i>

[Sofia]

01:07.535 --> 01:10.402
Slip the line through, and...

01:10.404 --> 01:11.904
unhh-- Arggh!

01:11.906 --> 01:13.906
Hey, Dad.
What are you up to?

01:13.908 --> 01:16.575
Ahh! I am going
to do a little fishing.

01:16.577 --> 01:19.778
It's supposed to be
very relaxing.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.613
Hmm. What about you, Sofia?

01:21.615 --> 01:24.249
- I'm going to meet Oona.
- Well, have fun.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.251
But be back in time
for the Water Show.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.720
It was so nice
of Queen Emmaline
to invite us.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.090
I wouldn't miss it.
Have fun fishing.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.925
Ha ha! I will.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.294
If I can just...
get started.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.496
Ohh! Arrgh!

02:08.462 --> 02:10.662
[conch horn blows]

02:27.014 --> 02:29.681
- That was amazing!
- [all] Sofia?

02:29.683 --> 02:32.751
Princess Sofia?
Hi there!

02:32.753 --> 02:34.586
Hi, Sven! Hi, everybody!

02:34.588 --> 02:36.588
I can't believe
that was only a rehearsal.

02:36.590 --> 02:39.424
And the real show's
gonna be even bigger!

02:39.426 --> 02:41.293
Did you like my fountain,
Sofia?

02:41.295 --> 02:43.996
Mother is teaching me
how to use the Current Conch.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.631
It was beautiful, Cora.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.832
I bet you didn't even notice

02:46.834 --> 02:48.867
<i> my</i> tiny little boring waves.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.502
I thought they looked great!

02:50.504 --> 02:52.437
This Mermaid Comb
can do all kinds

02:52.439 --> 02:53.972
of amazing things
with water,

02:53.974 --> 02:56.108
but I'm barely allowed
to do anything with it.

02:56.110 --> 02:59.178
Oona, I'll teach you in time.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.647
Can't I do something fun
for the show?

03:01.649 --> 03:03.482
Like a Water Bridge?

03:03.484 --> 03:05.517
Or maybe a tiny
little Sea Twister?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.786
Oh, you're way
too young for that.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.458
I told you I'll teach you
more skills when you're ready.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.727
But Mom, I'm ready<i> now.</i>

03:15.729 --> 03:19.798
Ahh. Now, Sofia,
if you will excuse me,

03:19.800 --> 03:23.168
Sven, I need you to run
some more errands.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.070
[Sven]
Yes, Your Highness.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.872
Don't worry, Oona.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.708
My big fountain
may be the star of the show,

03:29.710 --> 03:32.244
but your little waves
are adorable.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.746
Your fountain
isn't that big.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.582
Hmph!

03:36.584 --> 03:39.184
- Oona?
- Don't worry,
she'll be okay.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.420
She just needs
to cool off a little.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.691
It's not fair!

03:45.693 --> 03:48.894
My mom and Cora treat me
like I'm a little kid!

03:48.896 --> 03:51.830
Well, I have the Mermaid Comb.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.366
I can do a lot
more than they think.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.769
<i> ¶ My sister says</i>
<i> I am too little ¶</i>

03:57.771 --> 04:01.073
<i> ¶ And my mother</i>
<i> keeps on explaining ¶</i>

04:01.075 --> 04:04.743
<i> ¶ That I have to wait</i>
<i> on my training ¶</i>

04:04.745 --> 04:10.816
<i> ¶ But I'm old enough</i>
<i> to learn a trick or two ¶</i>

04:11.452 --> 04:15.220
<i> ¶ Every fish has school,</i>
<i> so I wish they'd teach me ¶</i>

04:15.222 --> 04:18.724
<i> ¶ What to do ¶</i>

04:18.726 --> 04:21.760
<i> ¶ I'm so much more</i>
<i> than what they say ¶</i>

04:21.762 --> 04:24.763
<i> ¶ Oh, how they'll see</i>
<i> so perfectly ¶</i>

04:24.765 --> 04:26.798
<i> ¶ All I can be ¶</i>

04:26.800 --> 04:32.037
<i> ¶ When I start</i>
<i> to make some waves ¶</i>

04:35.109 --> 04:38.777
<i> ¶ Like swimming against</i>
<i> a strong current ¶</i>

04:38.779 --> 04:41.780
<i> ¶ I must stay on course</i>
<i> and be steady ¶</i>

04:41.782 --> 04:44.950
<i> ¶ Till I prove to Mom</i>
<i> that I'm ready ¶</i>

04:44.952 --> 04:51.023
<i> ¶ With a bit of magic</i>
<i> from my Mermaid Comb ¶</i>

04:51.892 --> 04:54.793
<i>¶ I'll whip up a tiny Twister ¶</i>

04:54.795 --> 04:58.964
<i> ¶ And show them all</i>
<i> when I get home ¶</i>

04:58.966 --> 05:02.434
<i> ¶ That I'm so much more</i>
<i> than what they say ¶</i>

05:02.436 --> 05:05.270
<i> ¶ Oh, how they'll see</i>
<i> so perfectly ¶</i>

05:05.272 --> 05:06.905
<i> ¶ All I can be ¶</i>

05:06.907 --> 05:11.843
<i> ¶ When I start</i>
<i> to make some waves ¶</i>

05:11.845 --> 05:15.414
<i> ¶ How I yearn for this tide</i>
<i> to start to turn ¶</i>

05:15.416 --> 05:18.684
<i> ¶ Just like the sea,</i>
<i> there's so much inside of me ¶</i>

05:18.686 --> 05:21.920
<i>¶ My skills are still unknown ¶</i>

05:21.922 --> 05:25.290
<i> ¶ But I have</i>
<i> this Mermaid Comb ¶</i>

05:25.292 --> 05:28.960
<i> ¶ So if I make a splash</i>
<i> right here ¶</i>

05:28.962 --> 05:32.931
<i> ¶ I could be</i>
<i> Mermaid of the Year ¶</i>

05:32.933 --> 05:36.435
<i> ¶ Soon I'll be getting</i>
<i> cheered and praised ¶</i>

05:36.437 --> 05:41.173
<i> ¶ I guarantee Cora will see,</i>
<i> Mom will agree ¶</i>

05:41.175 --> 05:45.043
<i> ¶ When I start</i>
<i> to make some waves ¶</i>

05:45.045 --> 05:48.447
<i> ¶ I've gotta make some waves ¶</i>

05:48.449 --> 05:54.519
<i> ¶ I'm gonna</i>
<i> make some waves ¶</i>

05:55.389 --> 05:57.856
Yes! I did it!

05:57.858 --> 06:01.693
Uh, wait. Sea Twister--
Stop! Stop!

06:01.695 --> 06:03.962
Not the Seaweed Garden!

06:03.964 --> 06:07.899
Arggh! Look out
for that school of fish!

06:07.901 --> 06:10.235
Oh, no!
I can't let Mom see this!

06:10.237 --> 06:11.370
Wait!

06:11.372 --> 06:12.671
No, no, no.

06:12.673 --> 06:13.805
I have to stop it.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.807
[conch horn blowing]

06:15.809 --> 06:17.509
Oona's been gone a while.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.512
Oh, she's fine.
She just gets like this
sometimes.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.881
I'm going to
go check on her, Cora.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.549
See you at the show.

06:29.656 --> 06:30.922
Oona?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.392
Oo-na!

06:40.534 --> 06:42.934
Oona? Oona!

06:42.936 --> 06:44.569
Are you hiding?

06:47.708 --> 06:49.074
- Whoa!
- Aah!

06:49.076 --> 06:50.942
Did I getcha?
Are ya scared?

06:50.944 --> 06:54.012
You're scared, aren't ya?
[laughing]

06:54.014 --> 06:55.013
[gasps]

06:55.015 --> 06:56.948
Hey! Whatcha doin'?

06:56.950 --> 06:59.251
I think the better question is:

06:59.253 --> 07:00.919
What are<i> you</i> doing?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.455
I wasn't doin' nothin'.

07:03.457 --> 07:06.725
No? You weren't trying
to scare anyone?

07:06.727 --> 07:09.961
Nah. I'm a sweetheart.
Everybody loves me.

07:09.963 --> 07:13.231
I got a charming
personality. Ask her.

07:13.233 --> 07:15.100
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.802
He just startled me.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.538
Look, I'm a scare-acuda.
It's what I do.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.206
What do you want from me?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.942
That's an Enchantlet--
you're a Protector!

07:23.944 --> 07:26.111
I am indeed.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.213
My name's Nerissa,
and this is Rhona.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.415
- [Rhona] Hello.
- And who might you be,
young lady?

07:30.417 --> 07:33.151
- Uh, can I go?
- Hush!

07:33.153 --> 07:35.987
- I'm Sofia.
- Why did you go
in that cave?

07:35.989 --> 07:39.057
Every mermaid knows
not to go in a cave
like<i> that.</i>

07:39.059 --> 07:40.625
I'm not really a mermaid.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.994
Wait. Princess Sofia?

07:42.996 --> 07:45.764
As in Chrysta's-
Protector-Trainee Sofia?

07:45.766 --> 07:48.066
That's me.
So you know Chrysta?

07:48.068 --> 07:52.003
Know her? I was in training
at the same time as Chrysta.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.840
We had more fun
than a school of monkey fish.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.843
I like monkey fish.
They scare easy.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.145
Excuse me.
Ahem!

08:00.147 --> 08:04.149
Scare-acuda's agreed to stay
in the<i> north</i> end of the Cove?

08:04.151 --> 08:07.619
- Yeah, but--
- Are you<i> in</i> the north end
of the Cove?

08:07.621 --> 08:11.089
- No, but--
- Then where do you need to go?

08:11.091 --> 08:13.191
- North?
- That's right.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.026
You can go now.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.028
But if I see you here again...

08:17.030 --> 08:19.030
I'm goin', I'm goin'.

08:19.032 --> 08:21.500
These mermaids. Can't
scare anyone anymore.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.102
Everyone's so sensitive
all the time...

08:24.104 --> 08:27.038
So what brings you
to Merroway Cove, Sofia?

08:27.040 --> 08:29.841
I'm visiting a friend.
Why are you here?

08:29.843 --> 08:32.010
Are you on
a Protector mission?

08:32.012 --> 08:34.279
I am. To find
one of the Wicked Nine

08:34.281 --> 08:36.615
and take it to
the Mystic Isles
for safekeeping.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.817
One of the Wicked Nine?
Which one?

08:38.819 --> 08:41.353
Ursula's Magic Shell Necklace.

08:41.355 --> 08:44.189
It's been hidden
in the Kelp Forest here
for years.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.825
The one she captured
Ariel's voice in?

08:46.827 --> 08:49.494
Exactly. So I really
should be on my way.

08:49.496 --> 08:50.996
Good-bye, Sofia.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.364
I'm sure we'll meet again.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.901
- Come on, Rhona.
-  I hope so! Bye!

08:55.903 --> 08:57.702
Oona! There you are.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.038
- Oh! Hi, Sofia!
- Are you okay?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.373
I'm fine. Really.

09:01.375 --> 09:06.077
Have you seen maybe
a tiny little Sea Twister...

09:06.079 --> 09:08.680
kind of swirling by
around here?

09:08.682 --> 09:11.049
It's kind of like
an underwater tornado?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.317
But it's no big deal.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.552
[nervous laugh]
Forget it.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.986
No big deal?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.254
Oona, what happened?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.089
Remember how I said
the Mermaid Comb

09:18.091 --> 09:19.858
could make all kinds of things
with water?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.660
- Yeah?
- Well...

09:21.662 --> 09:24.095
I tried a new skill with it.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.063
Oh, no.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.098
I made a little Sea Twister,

09:27.100 --> 09:29.568
and it kind of got away from me?

09:29.570 --> 09:32.103
Oona!
Let's tell your mom.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.338
She'll know what to do.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.440
Oh, we don't
want to do<i> that.</i>

09:35.442 --> 09:38.743
I know what to do. I'm sure
I can make it disappear.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.946
Maybe you can
help me catch it?

09:40.948 --> 09:43.949
- [Sven panting]
- Sven! What's wrong?

09:43.951 --> 09:45.750
We have a Sea Twister!

09:45.752 --> 09:47.552
It's okay.
We know about that.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.888
What?! Did it come by here
already?

09:49.890 --> 09:53.558
No. We know because...
I made it.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.861
Oona, how could you do
such a thing!

09:56.863 --> 09:59.297
Sven, that's not important
right now.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.132
What's important
is that we stop it.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.235
Well, we have to tell the Queen!
She'll know what to do.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.870
No! We don't need Mom!

10:05.872 --> 10:07.872
We can stop the Twister
ourselves.

10:07.874 --> 10:10.875
I hope by "we"
you mean you,

10:10.877 --> 10:14.446
because I do not know
how to stop a Sea Twister.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.081
Maybe he's right, Oona.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.616
What if it's too big for you?

10:17.618 --> 10:19.918
That's why I'm asking
for you to help me.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.921
And if it's too big for us,
then I'll tell my mom. Okay?

10:22.923 --> 10:25.924
Okay. So, how do we find it?

10:25.926 --> 10:29.294
The Twister was last seen
moving toward the Kelp Forest.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.163
[gasps] Nerissa was heading
to the Kelp Forest.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.999
Come on!

10:36.770 --> 10:39.337
[Sofia gasps]
Look at the Kelp Forest!

10:39.339 --> 10:41.206
The Twister's already
been through here!

10:45.278 --> 10:48.113
[Crab]
Excuse me! Mermaids!

10:48.115 --> 10:50.448
Down here!
Would ya mind?

10:50.450 --> 10:52.250
Can I get a little help?

10:52.252 --> 10:54.185
Here you go, little guy.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.187
Thank you!

10:56.189 --> 10:59.624
There sure is a lot of damage.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.693
[Sven] And the longer
we wait to get your mom,

11:01.695 --> 11:03.294
the more damage it's going to--

11:03.296 --> 11:05.497
[octopus]
Look out below!!!

11:05.499 --> 11:07.232
Look out!

11:08.301 --> 11:10.602
[octopus panting]

11:10.604 --> 11:13.171
Sorry! Sorry, everyone!
Are you okay?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.539
Are<i> you</i> okay?

11:14.541 --> 11:15.940
I got caught up
in a Sea Twister.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.008
Can you believe it?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.376
Was it ginormous?

11:18.378 --> 11:20.378
I didn't see it
all that well.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.881
I was swimming along,
and then everything was swoosh,

11:22.883 --> 11:24.683
ker-blam, splat! What?!

11:24.685 --> 11:28.319
Crash! Is that an anchor?
Yes, it is! Kapowee!

11:28.321 --> 11:29.821
And here I am.

11:29.823 --> 11:32.123
Here you go.
That should do it.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.159
Thank you so much.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.194
Ahhh!

11:36.196 --> 11:38.229
I would have been
in real trouble,

11:38.231 --> 11:40.565
but out of nowhere
this super-strong mermaid
came and saved me.

11:40.567 --> 11:42.834
- Nerissa!
- Didn't catch her name,

11:42.836 --> 11:45.203
but she pulled me
away from the Twister.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.705
- Whoa!
- "Whoa" is right!

11:46.707 --> 11:48.373
She got me out of danger,

11:48.375 --> 11:50.241
but then<i> she</i> got caught
in the Twister.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.811
I tried to grab her,
but I only got
this bracelet thingy.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.913
That's her Enchantlet!

11:54.915 --> 11:56.314
Where did you last see her?

11:56.316 --> 11:57.382
At the shipwreck.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.316
What shipwreck?

11:58.318 --> 11:59.984
Not<i> your</i> shipwreck?

11:59.986 --> 12:04.155
Uh, no. Mine is on
the other side of the forest.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.392
He must mean
the Stormy Shipwreck!

12:07.394 --> 12:09.194
That's right!
It's back thataway!

12:09.196 --> 12:10.228
Come on!

12:10.230 --> 12:13.264
We have to try
to help Nerissa!

12:13.266 --> 12:16.568
Maybe this is a good time
to tell your mother?

12:16.570 --> 12:18.303
Hello? Wait up!

12:21.508 --> 12:23.675
[Sofia] Look! Over there!

12:27.848 --> 12:31.015
Sofia! You are a sight
for sore eyes.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.217
Are you all right?

12:32.219 --> 12:34.786
Yes, yes. I'm just stuck here.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.254
What can we do?

12:36.256 --> 12:39.257
This mast is<i> very</i> heavy.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.793
I don't think
your Enchantlet can lift it.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.896
Maybe if I Bond
our Enchantlets together
they'd be strong enough?

12:44.898 --> 12:48.867
Great thinking, Sofia,
but unfortunately
I lost my--

12:48.869 --> 12:50.702
Enchantlet!

12:50.704 --> 12:53.471
This friendly octopus
found it.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.774
I'm Octavio!
Remember me?

12:55.776 --> 12:57.408
Yes, I do.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.810
Octavio, thank you.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.245
You'll need this.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.746
Do you know how to do the Bond?

13:01.748 --> 13:04.215
I think so.
Chrysta taught me.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.451
Ready, Nerissa?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.453
- Ready.
- All right.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.322
One, two, three!

13:17.664 --> 13:18.997
[Sven] Wow!

13:20.400 --> 13:23.334
- [mast creaking]
- [Sofia grunting]

13:26.473 --> 13:27.939
Oh!

13:27.941 --> 13:29.340
Whoa!

13:31.077 --> 13:34.412
Ahh! Handled like
a true Protector, Sofia.

13:34.414 --> 13:36.648
- [Sven] Who knew?
- [Sofia] Thanks.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.483
Did you find
Ursula's necklace?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.519
I did. It was in a chest
buried under that shipwreck.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.522
Unfortunately, the Sea Twister
took the chest with it!

13:44.524 --> 13:46.758
Then we have to catch up
to that Twister.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.626
And get that necklace back.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.495
Can I lend
a tentacle?
I got eight!

13:50.497 --> 13:52.463
Thanks for all your help,
Octavio,

13:52.465 --> 13:54.365
you've been so brave.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.367
But I think you'd better
go home now.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.936
I guess you're right.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.771
If my mom hears about this,
she'll be like,

13:59.773 --> 14:02.140
"Octavio? A Twister? What?!

14:02.142 --> 14:03.975
"Wipe your tentacles!
Eat your seaweed!

14:03.977 --> 14:05.476
Go to bed!"

14:05.478 --> 14:06.344
Bye, you guys.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.813
Bye, Octavio. Thank you!

14:08.815 --> 14:11.449
I'm going too.
I've gotta make this right.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.218
Oona, wait!

14:13.220 --> 14:15.186
Oona!!!

14:22.462 --> 14:25.163
[Sven] Oona!
Get away from that thing!

14:25.165 --> 14:29.234
I'm okay, Sven!
I'm not too close!

14:29.236 --> 14:31.202
Look! Here's the chest!

14:31.204 --> 14:33.705
Why isn't it
spinning like crazy?

14:33.707 --> 14:36.174
It must be in
the eye of the Twister.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.910
It's a place in
the center of the Twister
where the water's calmer.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.346
So, how do we get
the chest out of there?

14:41.348 --> 14:43.514
I'll take care of it!

14:43.516 --> 14:45.550
Sea Twister!

14:45.552 --> 14:48.386
I command you to go!!!

14:50.390 --> 14:53.958
No! Not "grow!" I said "go!"

14:55.595 --> 14:58.263
Go! Go! Go!

14:59.766 --> 15:02.100
[grunting]

15:02.102 --> 15:04.636
[Oona screams]

15:11.278 --> 15:15.380
- [Sven whimpering]
- [Sofia grunting]

15:15.382 --> 15:17.348
Whoa! Whoa!

15:21.087 --> 15:22.620
- Sofia!
- Sven!

15:22.622 --> 15:25.590
Can't swim out!

15:25.592 --> 15:29.060
- Must swim in!
- [Sven] In?!

15:29.062 --> 15:31.930
Look! There's the chest!

15:35.201 --> 15:37.635
Good. We have Ursula's necklace.

15:37.637 --> 15:41.039
Okay, great.
But how do we
get out of here?

15:42.642 --> 15:44.242
What are we gonna do?

15:44.244 --> 15:45.576
I have an idea.

15:45.578 --> 15:47.779
I just hope Sofia
figures out what I'm doing.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.147
What<i> are</i> you doing?

15:49.149 --> 15:51.449
What is that?

15:53.954 --> 15:55.453
The Bond! Of course!

15:55.455 --> 15:57.555
Hold on tight, Sven.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.060
Gotcha!

16:10.770 --> 16:13.671
Look! The Twister
is moving toward the Palace!

16:13.673 --> 16:16.174
Oh, no! Everyone is
gathering there

16:16.176 --> 16:17.809
to get ready for
the Water Show!

16:19.346 --> 16:22.647
Oona, you know
what you have to do.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.483
Ohh. I tried
to make it right,

16:25.485 --> 16:26.951
but that turned out awful!

16:26.953 --> 16:28.686
And I don't know how to fix it.

16:28.688 --> 16:32.290
Uhhh! I have to go get my mom.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.858
I should have done it sooner.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.294
Sofia and I will try
to slow the Twister down.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.496
Swim like an arrow fish, Oona!

16:38.498 --> 16:40.098
Find the Queen!

16:40.100 --> 16:42.600
Now, let's see
what we can do.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.638
Cora! I'm looking for Mom.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.173
Oh. She's not here.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.675
She's helping
set up the show.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.610
- Why?
- Because I need her!

16:52.612 --> 16:55.713
Uh-oh. What did you do?

16:55.715 --> 16:58.049
Nothing. This is
between me and Mom.

16:58.051 --> 17:01.519
- Is she in the Cove?
- Oona, tell me
what's going on.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.221
I--I can't.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.489
There's a Sea Twister!

17:04.491 --> 17:06.958
- Sven!
- A Sea Twister?!

17:06.960 --> 17:08.559
That's why we need Mom.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.561
It's coming straight
for the Palace!

17:10.563 --> 17:13.131
Where did a Sea Twister
come from?

17:13.133 --> 17:15.700
I...kind of...made it?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.735
- You what?!
- I was trying

17:17.737 --> 17:19.737
to rehearse a new skill
for the show tonight.

17:19.739 --> 17:23.141
No, you were trying
to do something
you shouldn't have.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.876
[sighs] I know.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.412
And if I could take it back,
I would.

17:27.414 --> 17:31.649
I just wanted to do something
amazing for the show. Like you.

17:34.154 --> 17:38.156
Ya know, maybe
we don't need Mom.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.757
What?!

17:39.759 --> 17:42.360
I know how to use the Trident.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.328
- Mostly.
- Mostly?

17:44.330 --> 17:46.364
At least I've seen Mom use it,

17:46.366 --> 17:48.433
and this way we wouldn't have to
tell her what you did,

17:48.435 --> 17:51.402
- would we?
- No. We wouldn't.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.371
Oona,
this is a bad idea!

17:53.373 --> 17:55.239
She's doing the same thing
with the Trident

17:55.241 --> 17:56.908
that you did with the Comb!

17:56.910 --> 17:59.110
Sven always worries.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.578
It's true, I do.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.580
But this is still
a bad idea,

18:02.582 --> 18:04.715
and I'm not going
to be a part of it!

18:04.717 --> 18:07.618
Cora, can you really
handle the Trident?

18:07.620 --> 18:09.754
Of course I can.

18:09.756 --> 18:13.591
With...unh..a little help.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.294
Oh! We have to hurry!

18:16.296 --> 18:19.630
[Sofia] Nerissa,
let's pull those big rocks down

18:19.632 --> 18:21.332
and block the Twister!

18:32.612 --> 18:35.947
Oh, no! Now it's headed
straight for the Palace!

19:00.306 --> 19:01.472
[both gasp]

19:04.844 --> 19:06.644
Hold it up!

19:06.646 --> 19:09.747
I'm doing
the best I can!

19:34.307 --> 19:37.341
Queen Emmaline!

19:37.343 --> 19:40.711
Whew! I'm glad
to see you again,
Queen Emmaline.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.548
And I'm glad to see you
in one piece!

19:43.550 --> 19:45.683
You got here just in time.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.351
Thanks for getting your mom
so fast.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.854
She didn't get me--
Sven did.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.622
Yeah, I did.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.959
If you'll excuse me,
Your Highness,

19:54.961 --> 19:57.795
I must take this
to the Mystic Isles
right away.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.498
Go. With our gratitude.

20:00.500 --> 20:04.068
Sofia, I wouldn't have
Ursula's necklace
if it weren't for you.

20:04.070 --> 20:07.505
You're going to make
a wonderful Protector.

20:07.507 --> 20:10.074
Until next time.
Come on, Rhona,
let's go.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.876
Bye, Nerissa!

20:11.878 --> 20:14.145
Why didn't you come
get me right away?

20:14.147 --> 20:16.681
I thought I could control
the Trident.

20:16.683 --> 20:18.749
Ohh, Cora!

20:18.751 --> 20:21.552
You must never touch the Trident
without my permission.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.688
Is that understood?

20:23.690 --> 20:25.923
Yes. I'm sorry,
Mother.

20:25.925 --> 20:29.360
Mom, it wasn't Cora.
It was me.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.761
What do you mean?

20:30.763 --> 20:31.929
I made the Sea Twister.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.498
What?
Why would you do that?

20:34.500 --> 20:37.535
I wanted to do
a special skill
for the show tonight.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.937
Something just as amazing
as Cora's.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.906
You said you'd teach me
when I was older,

20:41.908 --> 20:43.841
but I wanted to try it now.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.676
I'm sorry.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.011
Please don't blame Cora.

20:47.013 --> 20:50.014
You should have
known better-- both of you.

20:50.016 --> 20:53.084
I'm afraid you're both
confined to the Palace.

20:53.086 --> 20:56.887
Does this mean
we can't be in the show tonight?

20:56.889 --> 21:01.859
Well, since you told the truth
and owned up to your mistakes,

21:01.861 --> 21:06.397
I suppose you could
start being confined
to the Palace...

21:06.399 --> 21:08.099
tomorrow.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.934
- Really?
- Yes!

21:09.936 --> 21:11.936
As long as you make sure

21:11.938 --> 21:13.971
this never happens again.

21:13.973 --> 21:17.875
- We promise.
Thank you, Mom.
- Thank you, Mom!

21:17.877 --> 21:21.279
Good. Oh! Now it's almost
time for the show.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.581
We don't want to keep
our guests waiting.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.982
Do we, Sofia?

21:24.984 --> 21:26.284
That's right.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.452
Oh, wait.
I'm one of your guests.

21:36.763 --> 21:38.162
Uh, hmm.

21:38.164 --> 21:40.598
- Where's Sofia?
- Right here, Dad.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.933
How was your fishing?
Did you catch anything?

21:42.935 --> 21:47.004
Ha ha! Yes!
A nice, long nap.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.473
[fanfare plays]

21:49.475 --> 21:51.275
Oh, the show is about to start.

21:51.277 --> 21:53.144
I'm glad you didn't miss
the excitement.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.812
We wouldn't want that.

22:02.955 --> 22:06.924
[music playing]

22:11.364 --> 22:12.863
Beautiful!

22:36.789 --> 22:38.856
