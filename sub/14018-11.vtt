00:00.934 --> 00:02.641
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.703 --> 00:06.617
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.673 --> 00:08.482
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.542 --> 00:11.318
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.119
These are their stories.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.691
LUISA: Tena,
Daddy's waiting for us.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.790
I'm waving to Max.

00:19.553 --> 00:22.898
Put on your coat and your gloves.
I won't tell you twice.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.203
And bring me Elena's hat.

00:30.797 --> 00:31.901
Can I bring Lily?

00:31.965 --> 00:33.035
Yes, but hurry.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.840
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

00:39.139 --> 00:40.482
I don't see Daddy and Max.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.849
Leon?

00:45.612 --> 00:47.023
Leon!

00:47.381 --> 00:49.054
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

00:52.786 --> 00:55.426
Max! Max!

01:00.594 --> 01:02.164
(SCREAMING IN SPANISH)

01:02.896 --> 01:05.399
The 5-year-old died
en-route to North General.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.211
Mr. Galvez was
dead at the scene.

01:08.268 --> 01:09.576
CURTIS: What were they
doing out this early?

01:09.670 --> 01:11.343
They were going to their
grandmother's in Albany.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.818
Point of impact was here, knocked
the kid right out of his boots.

01:15.142 --> 01:16.553
BRISCOE: You got a make on
the hit-and-run?

01:16.610 --> 01:17.953
NORRIS: No.
No witnesses so far.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.480
Want to see the other one?

01:19.546 --> 01:20.547
Other one?

01:20.614 --> 01:22.093
Around the corner.

01:22.482 --> 01:23.517
CURTIS: Any ID?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.359
NORRIS: Be my guest.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.263
I'll wager he didn't
live in Harlem.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.962
Peter Lavalle,
170 East 82nd Street.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.006
Long way from his townhouse.

01:35.062 --> 01:37.269
We're positing he got
hit at the crosswalk.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.869
The car swerved
after the impact,

01:40.934 --> 01:43.312
hit the curb going
around the corner,

01:44.137 --> 01:47.812
we got tire marks there,
then hit the other two.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.919
Anybody hear him
hit the brakes?

01:49.977 --> 01:51.820
No brakes.
No skid marks.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.286
Maybe no accident.

02:43.630 --> 02:48.045
Max always followed
his papa everywhere.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.143
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.314
We don't have any money.

02:58.378 --> 03:00.221
Victim Services can
help you with that.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.487
We'll make sure
the word gets out.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.485
Mama, can you open the juice?

03:04.885 --> 03:07.559
Here, let me give you a hand with that.
I'm an expert.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.969
Mrs. Galvez,
when you went downstairs,

03:12.025 --> 03:13.470
you're sure you
didn't see a car?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.063
No. I didn't see no car.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.365
I saw a car.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.233
You did? Where?

03:22.102 --> 03:25.049
She was looking outside
before we went downstairs.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.384
I waved at Max and
then I saw a car,

03:28.442 --> 03:30.752
but then Mama told me
to put on my coat.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.254
What was the car doing?

03:32.712 --> 03:34.123
It was driving on the street.

03:34.181 --> 03:35.524
Do you know what
kind of car it was?

03:37.017 --> 03:40.226
It was black. It was big.
It was driving fast.

03:48.695 --> 03:49.730
(GAS PS)

03:49.796 --> 03:51.571
BRISCOE: Why don't we sit down
over here, Mrs. Lavalle.

03:52.532 --> 03:53.636
Right here. Come on.

03:58.705 --> 03:59.706
Okay.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.312
Mrs. Lavalle, I'm sorry I have
to ask you these things,

04:05.378 --> 04:08.484
but what was your husband doing
up in that neighborhood?

04:11.651 --> 04:15.622
Well, he takes a walk
every Sunday,

04:17.624 --> 04:21.800
up Third Avenue and down First.
Every week.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.236
Can you think of anyone who might've
wanted to hurt your husband?

04:25.365 --> 04:26.366
MRS. LAVALLE: No.

04:26.466 --> 04:29.345
Why? It was an accident,
wasn't it?

04:29.402 --> 04:31.109
Well, we're not sure
what happened.

04:31.338 --> 04:34.046
Is there anybody else in
your family we can talk to?

04:35.408 --> 04:38.946
Our children,
Matthew and Daniel.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.757
I'll get you
their phone numbers.

04:47.154 --> 04:52.763
He had a walking stick, with
a sterling silver handle.

04:53.493 --> 04:54.733
Are you sure he
had it with him?

04:54.795 --> 04:56.274
Yes, of course.

04:56.496 --> 04:58.305
And I have to get it back.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.238
It belonged to his father.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.609
Officer.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.648
I didn't see a walking
stick at the scene.

05:05.705 --> 05:06.775
Neither did I.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.910
Somebody got there first.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.215
We find the walking stick,
maybe we find a witness.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.779
I'll call Profaci.

05:12.579 --> 05:13.853
Hey!
Hi, Daddy!

05:13.914 --> 05:14.915
Hey, bunny!

05:14.981 --> 05:16.619
Hi, Lennie! Hi, Deborah.
Nice to see you.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.321
Here we go, sweetie.
Hey, honey.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.125
How was the museum?

05:20.187 --> 05:21.359
Serena loved
the bike collection.

05:21.421 --> 05:22.422
You did?
Yeah.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.559
We brought you Chinese food.

05:23.623 --> 05:24.658
With shrimp and noodles.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.362
My favorites!
Mine, too.

05:26.726 --> 05:28.069
Mommy, I have to go now.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.198
Where's the ladies room?

05:29.262 --> 05:30.297
Upstairs. I'll take her.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.468
No, it's okay.
Come here, Serena.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.277
Okay. Hold on.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.690
Mr. Rogers and Mr.
Jones were discussing

05:53.753 --> 05:55.824
the merits of thunderbird
versus crack,

05:56.089 --> 05:59.969
when Mr. Jones pulled out what
Mr. Rogers described as a silver hammer

06:00.026 --> 06:01.164
and hit him upside
the head with it.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.298
A silver hammer?

06:02.596 --> 06:04.166
Black stick with
a silver handle.

06:04.231 --> 06:05.767
(SIREN WAILING)

06:08.335 --> 06:09.939
Let's go.
He had this with him.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.309
Meet Mr. Alternator Jones.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.875
Alternator?
Yeah.

06:14.941 --> 06:17.217
Says his dad worked at the
Ford plant in Detroit.

06:17.277 --> 06:18.517
You gonna get me
locked up again!

06:18.578 --> 06:19.784
Hey!
BRISCOE: Hey! Knock it off!

06:19.846 --> 06:20.847
Move him down the block.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.086
You ain't gonna give me nothing!
Shut up!

06:22.148 --> 06:23.422
That cat had it coming to him!

06:23.483 --> 06:25.190
That's not why
you're here, Mr. Jones.

06:25.252 --> 06:26.629
You want to tell me
where you found this?

06:26.686 --> 06:28.597
It's mine.
I found it on the street.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.532
Yeah,
on Pleasant Avenue, right?

06:31.992 --> 06:34.199
Look, that old guy
was already dead.

06:34.261 --> 06:37.037
Yeah, we know. He got run over.
We're hoping you saw it.

06:37.097 --> 06:40.135
I heard it. I saw the old guy
walking across the street.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.079
I went around the corner and I
heard this car gun its engine.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.273
It accelerated?

06:44.337 --> 06:45.475
Yeah. Then...

06:45.539 --> 06:47.143
Then I came back
around the corner,

06:47.207 --> 06:48.743
and the cat was dead,
that's all.

06:48.842 --> 06:49.843
You see the car?

06:49.910 --> 06:50.980
No, man.

06:51.044 --> 06:53.752
Look, I can't see nothing
with these glasses. Look.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.627
Look, you go
down to St. Anne's.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.027
Father Luke will fix you up
with a new pair, all right?

06:59.352 --> 07:00.922
And stay out of Mr.
Rogers' neighborhood.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.523
Yeah. I'm gonna do that.

07:06.493 --> 07:12.239
Okay, bruises, one on Lavalle's thigh
and the other on the boy's chest.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.841
CURTIS: From a headlight rim?

07:14.935 --> 07:17.415
You're looking at a
Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.746
You got pictures of these cars?

07:21.675 --> 07:22.710
This one.

07:25.745 --> 07:26.883
And that one, too.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.017
Okay.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.552
Mama, can I go play with Elena?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.960
Did Victim Services
get in touch with you?

07:36.022 --> 07:37.194
LUISA: Yes.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.960
And people sent
money and cards.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.774
People I don't know,
saying they're sorry

07:45.832 --> 07:49.837
and they're gonna
pray for Max and Leon.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.783
I want to thank them

07:52.839 --> 07:54.716
but some of them didn't
write down their names.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.952
Do you mind if we take a look?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.719
People have good hearts.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.020
TENA: Mommy!

08:02.515 --> 08:03.858
I'm sorry.

08:04.651 --> 08:09.532
A check for $67 and
a marriage proposal.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.165
He sent his picture.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.099
Guy must be dreaming.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.232
Give him credit for
keeping his clothes on.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.368
Hey, Lennie, look at this one.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.379
"Dear Mrs. Galvez,
I saw the news"

08:24.437 --> 08:25.973
"about your family
on television."

08:26.039 --> 08:27.780
"They showed your
little boy at the hospital."

08:27.841 --> 08:30.720
"He looked so small in his little
parka and his yellow boots."

08:31.177 --> 08:32.918
"I'm so sorry for all
the pain you're feeling."

08:33.046 --> 08:35.958
"I'm enclosing $500
to help with your needs."

08:36.015 --> 08:37.017
No signature.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.859
The kid wasn't wearing his
boots at the hospital.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.261
The boots were in the street.

08:41.988 --> 08:45.834
No return address either.
But the C-notes are real.

08:47.694 --> 08:50.641
Brand new. With consecutive
serial numbers.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.469
We traced the bills to
a bank in Murray Hill.

08:53.733 --> 08:55.679
They were disbursed the
same day they were mailed.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.904
Did the bank happen to know
who withdrew the money?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.815
Yeah. They narrowed it down to the
teller who did the transaction.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.988
He had two clients take
out $500 or more in cash

09:04.044 --> 09:05.079
in denominations of a hundred.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.146
No kidding.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.284
We have a Chinese immigrant who was
in Hong Kong the day of the accident.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.793
The bank knows
that because he made

09:10.850 --> 09:12.193
a cash machine
withdrawal there.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.630
The other one's
a Susan Young, 34,

09:14.687 --> 09:16.792
divorced, no kids, no car.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.392
But she has a driver's license.

09:18.458 --> 09:19.732
How do you want to handle her?

09:19.793 --> 09:21.932
I don't know. We drop in on
her, she's liable to shut down.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.372
Her bank has a stolen
credit card report on her.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.677
She got her purse snatched
about seven months ago.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.077
Good. Tell her we found it.

09:30.136 --> 09:33.208
And ask the bank how many
sugars she takes in her coffee.

09:34.941 --> 09:38.081
Talk about a surprise. I gave up
on ever getting that wallet back.

09:39.679 --> 09:40.919
Still want me to
look at mug shots?

09:40.980 --> 09:43.187
Yeah. We'll get to that.
Why don't you take a seat?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.997
Last Sunday morning
in East Harlem,

09:47.053 --> 09:49.055
three people were
killed in a hit-and-run.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.896
I saw it on the news.
It's horrible.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.331
You know what else is horrible?
We don't have any witnesses.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.268
The driver might get away
with killing those people

09:59.332 --> 10:00.436
'cause no one wants to talk.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.203
BRISCOE: That's kind of
like piling one horror

10:02.268 --> 10:03.804
on top of another.
Wouldn't you agree?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.106
Yes.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.983
Good. Now, anything you want to
tell us about this hit-and-run?

10:12.245 --> 10:13.315
I don't know what you mean.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.154
Weren't you in East Harlem,
Sunday morning?

10:15.882 --> 10:17.657
No. Why would you
think I was?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.024
The post mark is
from Murray Hill,

10:23.089 --> 10:24.762
about three blocks
from where you live.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.605
These bills trace
back to your bank.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.532
They were handed out
by the same teller

10:30.597 --> 10:32.440
on the same day
he gave you $500.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.973
BRISCOE: Now what do you bet
we find your prints on these

10:35.068 --> 10:37.947
and your DNA on
the stamp you licked?

10:40.140 --> 10:44.350
I felt sorry for that woman.
I wanted to help anonymously.

10:44.410 --> 10:46.048
Then why didn't you
come out and say so?

10:46.112 --> 10:47.819
You wrote that you
saw the little boy

10:47.881 --> 10:49.554
at the hospital
with his boots on.

10:49.749 --> 10:50.955
Where did you see that?

10:51.551 --> 10:52.689
On the news.

10:52.752 --> 10:54.527
He didn't have his
boots at the hospital.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.268
Maybe I read it. I don't remember.
CURTIS: You're lying.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.260
You were there at the accident.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.861
No. BRISCOE: Why are
you covering up?

11:00.927 --> 11:02.531
What are you afraid of?
Nothing.

11:02.595 --> 11:03.665
I have to get back to work.

11:03.730 --> 11:04.765
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

11:05.031 --> 11:08.069
What's this bruise here? That looks
like it could be from a seat belt.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.169
No. I fell.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.805
You were in the car, weren't you?
No.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.214
You might not have been driving,
but you were in the damn car.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.150
That's crazy. Now, please...
Look at this!

11:16.376 --> 11:18.322
That's a picture of the
little boy in the morgue.

11:18.444 --> 11:22.586
Take a look. Look at what happened to him.
Look at it, damn you!

11:22.982 --> 11:23.983
(GROANS)

11:30.023 --> 11:32.003
That's one way to get
her to spill her guts.

11:32.792 --> 11:33.998
She knows who was driving.

11:34.093 --> 11:37.131
And unless she wants to tell us,
we can't force it out of her.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.532
I want to leave now.

11:39.599 --> 11:40.634
You're sure?

11:41.634 --> 11:44.171
Please, I don't know anything.
I wasn't there.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.144
Her bruise is on
the right side.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.689
That puts her in
the passenger seat.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.850
She have any connection
to the Lavalle family?

11:53.913 --> 11:57.759
They never heard of her. By the way,
both the Lavalle kids are alibied.

11:57.817 --> 11:59.353
CURTIS: We checked her IUDs
for the last month,

11:59.652 --> 12:01.859
nothing jumps out
that traces to the Lavalles.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.126
So it could be
just an accident.

12:06.192 --> 12:08.604
Three people run down? To you
that's just an accident?

12:09.262 --> 12:12.471
Can't we put some paper on
Ms. Young and force her to talk?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.978
We subpoena her to the grand
jury, she'll ask for immunity.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.680
JACK: Until we know
how she's involved,

12:16.736 --> 12:18.113
I don't want to give it to her.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.045
If you keep the pressure up,
you think she'll come around?

12:22.408 --> 12:24.513
We'll lean on her
just as hard as you let us.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.116
You sure she didn't
come in the back door?

12:28.214 --> 12:31.058
Maybe she hit a shoe sale on her
way back from work. I don't know.

12:31.517 --> 12:32.723
Thanks.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.459
Hey, why don't we grab
some food and come back?

12:38.524 --> 12:39.764
No. Let's give it
another 10 minutes.

12:39.826 --> 12:42.238
I want her to see us
when she gets here.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.642
You know, I got in touch
with Mrs. Galvez yesterday?

12:45.064 --> 12:46.771
She has to move in
with her mother.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.471
She can't manage
without her husband.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.846
You know what you do, Rey? Grab all
the life insurance you can afford.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.279
Davey says you're
waiting for Ms. Young?

12:56.342 --> 12:57.912
She left last night
with a suitcase.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.615
Said she'd be gone
for a couple of weeks.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.817
Did she say where?

13:00.880 --> 13:04.191
No. Sometimes she stays at her
boyfriend's when he's out of town.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.187
Where does he live?
I wouldn't know.

13:06.252 --> 13:07.322
Name?

13:07.387 --> 13:08.422
I wouldn't know that either.

13:10.089 --> 13:12.535
Her office says she's at
her sister's in Groton.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.105
Her boyfriend who travels?

13:15.161 --> 13:17.163
Look at her IUDs for the week
before the accident.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.508
See these calls
to Rio de Janeiro?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.543
Every night.
Minimum of 20 minutes.

13:21.868 --> 13:23.211
Expensive heavy breathing.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.305
Last call was made
Saturday afternoon.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.351
So the boyfriend
flew back Sunday.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.448
The accident was
near the Triborough.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.082
So if they were
coming from the airport,

13:31.210 --> 13:32.450
they might've
crossed the bridge.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.890
What? She picked him up?
She doesn't have a car.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.483
Maybe he does.

13:39.919 --> 13:43.332
The new-guy shift, Saturday 10:00 p.m.
to Sunday 6:00.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.933
Really cuts into my booty time.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.539
Two weeks ago Sunday,
the flight from Rio.

13:50.730 --> 13:52.334
You remember her
with one of the passengers?

13:52.899 --> 13:54.401
Yeah, sure.

13:54.734 --> 13:57.476
Yeah? 30,000 people later,
you remember her.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.813
I remember the belligerent
fool she was with.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.950
Kept lighting up in
the no-smoke zone.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.247
You talked to him?

14:03.309 --> 14:05.050
I talked, he yelled.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.584
Customs was ready to take
him for a cavity search

14:07.647 --> 14:08.955
'cause he pissed them off.

14:09.215 --> 14:10.785
Gave his lady a hard time, too.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.857
What was his problem?

14:12.985 --> 14:14.692
You could smell
his problem, scotch.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.495
CURTIS: So he was drunk?

14:16.556 --> 14:17.796
Unless he uses
the stuff for cologne.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.162
CURTIS: You remember
his name?

14:20.226 --> 14:21.500
I wrote him up in my report.

14:22.995 --> 14:24.770
BRISCOE: His name's
Bernard Dressier.

14:24.831 --> 14:27.675
His credit card company confirms
he was at the hotel in Rio.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.981
Damn! It ate my quarter.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.546
His name's also on Young's IUDs

14:35.608 --> 14:37.246
the whole month
before the accident.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.846
Now she hasn't
called him since.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.925
Look. Downtown is
sweating my budget,

14:40.980 --> 14:43.426
their way of saying how much
they appreciate my lawsuit.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.390
So solve this quick
or hand it off to AIU.

14:46.652 --> 14:50.498
Hey, I ran Dressier through
DMV, he owns a black' 92 Jag.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.631
Consistent with
the bruises on the bodies.

14:52.725 --> 14:56.468
And get this, he has two moving
violations and a DWI from last year.

14:56.529 --> 15:00.272
Six months probation, 12 hours
drunk school and no suspension?

15:00.333 --> 15:01.505
Must've had some lawyer.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.945
He better hope his
lawyer hasn't retired.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.513
I had a couple of drinks, then I
went to sleep. I wasn't drunk.

15:10.943 --> 15:13.287
BRISCOE: Airport security
said you were quite a handful.

15:13.346 --> 15:16.088
You do 11 hours on a plane
and see how chipper you feel.

15:16.315 --> 15:19.922
Dena, get me David Feist in Bonn.
Try the home number first.

15:20.219 --> 15:21.493
How'd you get home
from the airport?

15:21.554 --> 15:22.794
Cab. Why?

15:23.156 --> 15:24.362
You know Susan Young?

15:24.423 --> 15:25.458
What's she have
to do with this?

15:25.525 --> 15:26.765
CURTIS: She picked you up
from the airport, right?

15:26.826 --> 15:27.861
No.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.439
Somebody saw you with her.

15:29.495 --> 15:30.940
With a blond, it wasn't Susan.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.271
You want to stand still for a minute.
So who was the blond?

15:34.700 --> 15:40.173
It was another passenger, somebody
wanting to split cab fare to Islip.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.684
Tell me. Really.
This isn't about me

15:42.742 --> 15:44.619
causing a disturbance
at the airport, is it?

15:44.844 --> 15:46.881
That Sunday morning,
three pedestrians

15:46.946 --> 15:48.926
were killed by
a hit-and-run driver.

15:49.248 --> 15:51.125
We think Ms. Young had
something to do with it.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.959
That's not possible.

15:53.019 --> 15:54.362
BRISCOE: Have you
talked to her lately?

15:54.854 --> 15:57.767
No. Things were cooling off
before I went to Rio

15:57.824 --> 15:59.132
and we haven't connected since.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.602
You still own a Jaguar?

16:01.060 --> 16:02.061
Yeah.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.630
You still drinking and driving?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.568
That's very funny.
I learned my lesson.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.804
BRISCOE: Good for you.

16:08.367 --> 16:11.177
So, would you mind if we had
our lab check your car?

16:11.337 --> 16:12.611
(CHUCKLES)

16:12.672 --> 16:13.912
If I said no?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.316
We find a judge to say yes.

16:16.609 --> 16:20.614
Okay, but I'm calling
my lawyer.

16:22.715 --> 16:23.955
Dena will show you
where it's parked.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.859
And if you scratch it,
you fix it.

16:29.388 --> 16:31.561
A car hits a body, something from
that body's gonna get sucked

16:31.624 --> 16:34.662
into the engine compartment.
Hair, skin, fiber, blood.

16:34.894 --> 16:36.032
There's nothing like that here.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.165
You sure this is his car?

16:37.463 --> 16:39.875
The VIN numbers from the dash,
the frame and the engine block

16:39.932 --> 16:41.741
all match his registration.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.509
Also didn't find any damage
or any evidence it had work.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.946
That's too bad. I was looking
forward to hooking up this guy.

16:47.006 --> 16:50.954
MAN: Fred,
I checked the fourth VIN tag.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.356
FRED: Everybody thinks
there's just three,

16:53.412 --> 16:55.551
only the manufacturer knows
where the fourth one is,

16:55.681 --> 16:56.887
and they only tell the FBI.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.121
It's different on every model.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.424
This one's on the inside
of the floor pan.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.829
I had to drill a hole and use
a dentist's mirror to see it.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.196
And it doesn't match
the other three.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.496
So this isn't his car?

17:04.557 --> 17:07.299
Same model, same year, same color.
It's not his.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.397
He probably got this one from a
dealer and switched the VIN tags.

17:10.695 --> 17:13.040
Any way to tell who had
this car before Dressier?

17:18.003 --> 17:20.916
Yes. We have a car with that VIN number.
It's a '92 Jag.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.550
It hasn't been sold?

17:22.608 --> 17:23.678
No.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.885
Not even to a Bernard Dressier?

17:29.916 --> 17:31.020
No.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.791
So, the car is here?

17:35.655 --> 17:37.191
All these cars have
been cleared for export.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.735
I mean,
they're fully documented.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.428
Big market for used
Jaguars in Russia?

17:41.961 --> 17:43.770
Used everything.
The VIN numbers match.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.807
The right fender's new.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.370
The grille's new. The paint's new.
Bumper's been replaced.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.407
Right spoiler bracket's bent.

17:52.471 --> 17:53.745
This is your killer, gentlemen.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.915
Time to come clean,
Mr. Pettijohn.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.887
Did you trade cars
with Bernie Dressier?

17:59.145 --> 18:01.591
His bank issues me
letters of credit, okay?

18:01.647 --> 18:02.990
Without them,
I'm out of business.

18:03.516 --> 18:04.927
You're out of business now.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.256
You want to step
away from the desk?

18:08.321 --> 18:09.356
What's going on?

18:09.422 --> 18:12.028
Your car came back from
Russia, Bernie, with love.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.399
Bernard Dressier,
you're under arrest

18:13.459 --> 18:15.939
for the deaths of Peter Lavalle,
and Leon and Max Galvez.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.400
Wait. Get away from me.
Hey! Get off me...

18:18.464 --> 18:20.273
Take it easy, Bernie!
Hey! Let me go!

18:20.333 --> 18:21.607
I said give it up!

18:22.869 --> 18:24.815
You bastards. CURTIS: You have
the right to remain silent.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.406
You stupid bastards!
Anything you say can

18:26.472 --> 18:28.543
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

18:31.911 --> 18:34.391
$1 million for
vehicular manslaughter two?

18:34.447 --> 18:35.721
These are "D" felonies,
Your Honor.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.021
Their case is
nothing but fumes.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.756
There's no evidence
my client was at the scene.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.294
There's evidence his car was.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.661
A bent fender bracket?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.064
They want to put
three bodies on my guy,

18:43.122 --> 18:44.430
they'll have to do
better than that.

18:44.490 --> 18:47.664
I don't want your client
joining his car in Russia.

18:48.227 --> 18:50.138
Bail's set at $1 million.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.309
A million bucks. He must
like the cut of your skirt.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.546
From what I hear,
he'd prefer yours.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.944
CLERK: "Docket number 026797."

19:02.008 --> 19:04.921
Don't smile yet. It's the
work-up of Dressler's car.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.857
There's no physical
evidence of the victims.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.325
The car had been steam-cleaned
bumper-to-bumper.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.725
What about
Dressler's girlfriend?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.091
Wasn't she with
him at the airport?

19:12.184 --> 19:13.424
That ID is soft.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.397
The police showed the guard
another picture of Young,

19:15.454 --> 19:16.899
he wasn't so sure.

19:17.189 --> 19:19.635
So find somebody else
who saw them together.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.565
Another passenger on the plane.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.566
I'll subpoena the manifest.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.340
The airline refuses to
comply with our subpoena.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.240
They're saying
the Warsaw Convention

19:28.301 --> 19:29.974
protects them from
actions by state courts.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.510
They poured the booze
that got Dressier drunk.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.117
They're afraid of getting sued.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.284
They're right about
the Warsaw Convention.

19:36.442 --> 19:37.716
The only place we
can bring process

19:37.843 --> 19:39.151
against them is
in federal court.

19:39.478 --> 19:41.287
Then go ahead, do it.
I did.

19:41.547 --> 19:43.891
The US Attorney doesn't think
a couple of "D" felonies

19:43.949 --> 19:45.326
warrant their attention.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.857
The airlines has offices here?

19:46.919 --> 19:48.057
Three.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.864
They won't honor our subpoenas,

19:53.092 --> 19:54.901
seize their furniture,
computers,

19:54.961 --> 19:56.736
whatever you can
lay your hands on.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.434
Smack them around.

20:03.235 --> 20:07.377
They shut down our ticket offices. They
took files, they took computer disks.

20:07.473 --> 20:08.952
You can't imagine our losses.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.181
We served them with a subpoena
for a flight manifest.

20:11.243 --> 20:14.281
They refused to honor it. A search
warrant's our only recourse.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.519
Mr. Fischer,

20:15.581 --> 20:17.891
why doesn't VIA airlines simply
give them what they want?

20:17.950 --> 20:19.657
Judge Feldman,
according to the terms

20:19.719 --> 20:21.665
of the Warsaw Convention,
we don't have to.

20:21.754 --> 20:25.099
The spirit of the convention is to
limit liability in civil suits.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.728
It's not meant as a shield
in criminal investigations.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.000
Lawsuits are exactly
what we're trying to limit.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.043
The search warrants are valid on their face.
I see no reason to void them.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.100
Your Honor, I...

20:34.200 --> 20:36.111
Either you comply
with their subpoena,

20:36.168 --> 20:38.148
or lawsuits will be
the least of your worries.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.987
The manifest will be on Mr. McCoy's
fax machine in an hour.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.489
Thank you. Thank you.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.084
JUDGE FELDMAN:
Oh, Mr. McCoy,

20:55.988 --> 20:57.160
you know, it's not an accident

20:57.223 --> 20:59.396
that this case
was assigned to me.

20:59.692 --> 21:02.605
I believe drunk driving to
be a plague on our society.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.464
If you hit any snags,
you let me know.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.139
Sounds like the makings
of a stump speech.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.947
It is. He's planning a run
for Adam's job next spring.

21:16.142 --> 21:18.247
And drunk driving is
the cause he's embracing?

21:18.310 --> 21:19.846
It's not world peace.

21:20.513 --> 21:22.891
Shouldn't Dressler's lawyer
know about Feldman's bias?

21:23.416 --> 21:24.986
I'm not gonna tell him.

21:26.252 --> 21:29.324
Come on, Jamie, a judge with an
agenda, this is news to you?

21:35.694 --> 21:39.642
Dressier, yeah. That loudmouth,
he complained about the food,

21:39.698 --> 21:41.575
the wine selection,
the service.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.073
What did he think it was,
Lutece up there?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.513
Do you know how much he drank?

21:46.105 --> 21:48.483
No. But every time I looked over,
he had a drink in his hand.

21:48.808 --> 21:49.878
BRISCOE: And?

21:51.243 --> 21:54.884
Yeah, that's her. Yeah. I saw
them leave the terminal together.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.151
Why did you notice them?

21:56.215 --> 21:57.285
It was hard not to.

21:58.117 --> 22:00.290
That poor woman,
he was bellowing

22:00.352 --> 22:02.457
and gesticulating at her.
A real bully.

22:03.456 --> 22:04.491
Thank you for coming in.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.558
BRISCOE: Thanks.

22:07.793 --> 22:10.899
Okay. That's three passengers
who saw them together.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.306
What about flight attendants?

22:12.364 --> 22:14.742
Two in first class. They're
both in South America.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.076
The airline will let us know
next time they're in town.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.382
How about Ms. Young?

22:19.905 --> 22:21.441
I didn't go out all morning.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.818
I don't know how Bernie got
home from the airport.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.316
Three people saw you with him.

22:26.812 --> 22:29.156
Look, you're here under a
material witness warrant.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.627
That means we keep you
until you cooperate.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.162
You'll be in the tombs with
crack addicts and prostitutes

22:35.287 --> 22:36.561
for as long as it takes.

22:36.622 --> 22:39.296
It gets worse. We can place you
and Mr. Dressier in the car.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.001
I don't care which
one of you was driving.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.869
This is a triple homicide and
somebody's going to pay for it.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.373
We can give you protection,
Ms. Young.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.013
Once he's convicted and sent
to prison, he can't hurt you.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.080
What if he doesn't
go to prison?

22:53.806 --> 22:56.116
He's gotten off before,
in Massachusetts.

22:56.275 --> 22:58.687
He hit a teenage girl.
He told me.

22:59.578 --> 23:02.320
You get us the evidence,
this time he goes to jail.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.521
Look, as bad as you feel
about that little boy,

23:06.318 --> 23:08.821
how you gonna feel the next
time he kills somebody?

23:15.761 --> 23:17.172
(SIGHS)

23:17.563 --> 23:21.306
I wasn't home one night when
Bernie called me from Rio.

23:23.836 --> 23:28.717
He thought I was with someone else.
He was furious.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.816
As soon as he saw me at the
airport, he started ranting.

23:32.878 --> 23:34.653
He grabbed the keys.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.422
(SIGHS)

23:38.217 --> 23:41.130
He yelled at me the whole
way into the city.

23:44.557 --> 23:47.436
He said if he found out who
I was with, he'd kill them.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.839
He didn't think I believed him.
Then we saw the old man.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.674
I yelled at Bernie to stop.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.752
But he sped up right into him.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.887
He killed Mr. Lavalle
on purpose?

24:09.081 --> 24:11.425
I don't know,
I can't imagine...

24:12.685 --> 24:14.028
What about the other two?

24:16.655 --> 24:19.534
The little boy,

24:19.592 --> 24:22.664
his father stepped into the
street and waved at us to stop.

24:23.862 --> 24:25.899
Bernie didn't even
try to miss them.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.840
How drunk was he?

24:31.203 --> 24:34.241
I don't know.
I can never tell with Bernie.

24:36.842 --> 24:38.685
I never know what
he's going to do.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.090
Dressier keeps a country
house in East Lenox.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.924
He ran a red light
there two years ago,

24:45.985 --> 24:47.658
hit a little girl on a bicycle.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.896
She spent eight
months in the hospital.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.924
JACK: Why didn't
the police know?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.436
ROSS: It's not
on his record here.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.634
He has two driver's licenses, one in
New York and one in Massachusetts.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.766
The judge there
suspended his license

24:59.832 --> 25:01.436
for five years
because of the accident.

25:01.901 --> 25:04.347
Which automatically suspends
his driving privileges here.

25:04.403 --> 25:07.577
That ups the charge to first
degree vehicular manslaughter.

25:07.706 --> 25:11.279
Not enough. We're gonna make
an example of Mr. Dressier.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.513
JACK: What do you
have in mind?

25:13.579 --> 25:15.149
This was a multiple killing.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.521
First degree murder.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.492
Murder one requires intent.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.330
JACK: He accelerated
into one victim.

25:26.959 --> 25:31.931
He made no effort to avoid two others.
That's intent.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.538
Not if he was drunk.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.840
Maybe he meant to hit the
brakes instead of the gas?

25:36.035 --> 25:38.276
A couple of drinks
don't negate intent.

25:38.337 --> 25:39.748
But we don't know
how much he had to drink.

25:39.805 --> 25:42.445
If we don't know,
the grand jury won't either.

25:43.675 --> 25:44.676
But at trial the...

25:44.743 --> 25:47.485
ADAM: Get an indictment.
Scare the pants off him.

25:48.581 --> 25:52.688
Maybe he pleads to murder two.
We've sent a message.

25:59.691 --> 26:03.798
First Feldman, now Adam. The
bandwagon's getting crowded.

26:04.763 --> 26:07.835
I agree with Adam. And I'm
not running for anything.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.614
Murder one? Where the hell
is this murder one? Iran?

26:14.673 --> 26:16.584
Try section seven
sub-section one,

26:16.642 --> 26:18.519
paragraph eight of the statute.

26:19.511 --> 26:20.990
He took three
lives with intent.

26:21.046 --> 26:22.548
He wasn't even in the car.

26:22.614 --> 26:24.059
Not according to
his girlfriend.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.392
What, that bitch? How do you
know she wasn't driving?

26:26.718 --> 26:29.130
We believe her.
We don't believe you.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.667
I still don't see
an intentional murder.

26:32.324 --> 26:35.134
Two witnesses saw him
accelerate into Mr. Lavalle.

26:36.095 --> 26:39.599
Given your client's driving record,
here and in Massachusetts,

26:39.998 --> 26:42.535
a jury's not going to
split hairs over intent.

26:42.601 --> 26:46.276
This is nuts. You want to
give me the death penalty?

26:46.939 --> 26:49.783
JACK: Unless you plead
to second degree murder.

26:50.642 --> 26:51.712
What's that?

26:52.177 --> 26:54.214
Twenty-five-to-life.

26:54.680 --> 26:56.125
God.
Bernie.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.527
(EXHALES)

27:04.690 --> 27:06.692
Didn't any of your witnesses
tell you he was drunk?

27:06.892 --> 27:09.600
They saw him with a drink. Doesn't
make him legally intoxicated.

27:09.661 --> 27:11.868
The flight attendant who served
him knows how much he had.

27:11.997 --> 27:13.237
I stopped counting at 12.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.641
Puts him well
over the legal limit

27:14.700 --> 27:16.509
and well beyond
the ability to form intent.

27:16.902 --> 27:19.712
Even if he was driving, we're
back to vehicular manslaughter.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.448
There's nothing in Westlaw.

27:23.542 --> 27:26.022
If it was two or three drinks,
we could still argue intent,

27:26.078 --> 27:28.058
but 12...
According to him.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.691
If he can prove it,
he's off the hook.

27:29.748 --> 27:31.955
He kills three people
and hides behind a bottle.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.922
The law says he can.

27:34.019 --> 27:36.659
The law. Probably written
on a cocktail napkin.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.666
Intent follows the bullet.
It shouldn't matter

27:38.724 --> 27:41.102
if it was fired by
a drunk or by Carry Nation.

27:41.693 --> 27:43.229
The airline's lawyer called.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.206
Dressler's flight attendant's
coming in tonight.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.711
I served Mr. Dressier
fifteen drinks.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.078
We ran out of
scotch in first class

27:53.138 --> 27:54.879
so I took some
bottles from coach.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.109
JACK: How was he behaving?

27:57.176 --> 27:58.655
He was difficult.

27:59.311 --> 28:00.813
Was he drunk?

28:01.146 --> 28:03.285
He wasn't climbing
on the beverage cart.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.557
But he slurred his words,
spilled a drink on himself.

28:07.553 --> 28:10.591
I had to fill out his Customs
declaration for him.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.527
He couldn't even sign his name.

28:14.159 --> 28:16.196
Thank you, Ms. Barra.

28:16.261 --> 28:18.639
Mr. Fischer, can we have
a word with you outside?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.478
We want fair warning
before she testifies.

28:22.734 --> 28:25.180
This case is already front
page of the Daily News.

28:25.404 --> 28:28.647
I appreciate Ms. Barra's testimony
might prove embarrassing.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.654
I see here she's
a Colombian national.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.657
You realize, as long as she
doesn't return to this country,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.090
she can't be
compelled to testify.

28:36.148 --> 28:37.491
The District
Attorney's authority

28:37.549 --> 28:39.495
doesn't extend to
foreign citizens abroad.

28:44.456 --> 28:45.628
What the hell are you doing?

28:46.191 --> 28:47.693
You don't want Dressier to
prove how drunk he was,

28:47.759 --> 28:49.363
so you're telling a witness
to leave the country?

28:49.428 --> 28:51.237
Don't worry about it.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.172
The airline's giving
me the run-around.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.507
They said she's been reassigned

28:56.568 --> 28:58.377
to the
Bogota-Buenos Aires route.

28:58.437 --> 28:59.780
Why tell me?
I know you talked to her.

28:59.838 --> 29:00.873
Did you take a statement?

29:00.939 --> 29:02.885
I've complied
with Rosario, Brady

29:02.941 --> 29:04.978
and all relevant
discovery procedures.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.817
Whatever she said, if she
said it, is not discoverable.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.224
I don't know what
you're up to, McCoy,

29:10.682 --> 29:12.662
but I'm gonna compel you
to turn over her statement.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.798
Knock yourself out.

29:16.822 --> 29:19.393
Ms. Barra's a witness. If she
gave Mr. McCoy a statement,

29:19.458 --> 29:20.801
I'm entitled to it.

29:21.326 --> 29:22.430
She's not our witness.

29:22.494 --> 29:25.168
If Mr. Billings wants her to be
his witness, he can subpoena her.

29:25.631 --> 29:26.974
BILLINGS: Beside the point.

29:27.032 --> 29:30.070
I believe Mr. McCoy has a statement
that exculpates my client.

29:30.202 --> 29:31.647
JACK: I don't believe
it does, Your Honor.

29:31.837 --> 29:35.307
Mr. McCoy, do you have
her statement in writing?

29:35.374 --> 29:37.183
Yes.
May I see it, please?

29:42.347 --> 29:43.758
Thank you.

29:44.483 --> 29:45.985
(CLEARING THROAT)

29:52.257 --> 29:53.759
I don't see anything here,
Mr. Billings.

29:54.493 --> 29:56.336
I'd like to see it, Your Honor.
I already have.

29:56.829 --> 29:59.833
I've made my ruling. Your
motion to compel is denied.

30:01.934 --> 30:04.574
She told us he drank enough
booze to float the Queen Mary.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.013
Her statement is exculpatory.

30:06.071 --> 30:07.277
Only if Feldman says it is.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.979
Jack, I know his agenda.
What's yours?

30:10.075 --> 30:13.113
The maximum penalty for first
degree vehicular manslaughter

30:13.178 --> 30:14.680
is 5 to 15 years.

30:15.013 --> 30:17.015
Put a girl in a coma,
killed three people,

30:17.082 --> 30:18.561
and he walks away
with five years?

30:18.617 --> 30:20.460
He isn't even sorry.
It isn't justice.

30:20.519 --> 30:23.363
Neither is concealing evidence.
You could get disbarred.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.026
That's up to you.
This is what I'm gonna do.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.509
NORRIS: We looked at
a number of factors

30:33.565 --> 30:34.976
to determine
the force at impact.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.409
For example, we know
that a human thigh bone

30:37.469 --> 30:39.949
breaks under 1,100 pounds of
pressure per square inch.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.641
As a result of
your calculations,

30:41.707 --> 30:43.744
can you tell us
how fast Mr. Dressler's car

30:43.809 --> 30:45.618
car was traveling when
it struck Mr. Lavalle?

30:46.445 --> 30:50.450
Yes. The car was moving in excess
of 30 to 35 miles per hour.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.754
What, if any,
evidence did you find

30:53.885 --> 30:56.661
that Mr. Dressier tried
to avoid hitting his victims?

30:57.789 --> 31:01.066
None. There were no skid
marks, no yaw marks.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.306
All three victims
were struck head-on.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.635
JACK: Thank you.

31:07.466 --> 31:10.743
Detective Norris, isn't it
common not to find skid marks

31:10.802 --> 31:12.281
in drunk-driving accidents?

31:12.337 --> 31:15.375
Objection. The defendant is not
charged with drunk driving.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.883
JUDGE FELDMAN: Sustained.

31:17.643 --> 31:21.455
Detective, is it unusual
for an intoxicated driver

31:21.513 --> 31:23.754
to step on the accelerator
when he intended to...

31:23.815 --> 31:24.816
Objection.

31:25.150 --> 31:26.151
Sustained.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.394
(EXHALES)

31:29.654 --> 31:33.124
Let's talk reaction times, detective.
Sober versus intoxicated...

31:33.425 --> 31:34.768
Sustained.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.809
Mr. Billings, next question.

31:42.501 --> 31:43.673
No more questions.

31:49.675 --> 31:53.122
The write-up of the interview
with Ms. Young has a TPO glitch.

31:53.178 --> 31:56.216
The accident was at 6:10,
Rey wrote down 16:10.

31:56.681 --> 31:59.525
I'll mention it to Jack.
I think we're done.

32:05.457 --> 32:07.198
Has he talked to
you about this case?

32:07.559 --> 32:10.597
McCoy? Yeah.
Briefings, witness preps...

32:11.730 --> 32:13.403
I don't mean that.

32:16.501 --> 32:20.244
You mean, has he said, "This
one's for Claire Kincaid"?

32:20.705 --> 32:21.945
No.

32:22.574 --> 32:25.214
That guy got 12 months
at Mount McGregor.

32:25.477 --> 32:28.947
Yeah, I know. I pulled the file.
You were in the car with her.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.162
Yeah. I was catching
a ride home.

32:34.586 --> 32:37.999
Claire came down to the bar to
pick up McCoy, he'd already split.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.130
Bad timing all around.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.265
Listen, this hump Dressier,

32:44.329 --> 32:46.570
I'm keeping them crossed
he gets what he deserves.

32:53.638 --> 32:59.054
I told him to stop, to help those people.
He kept driving.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.685
He dropped me off
at my apartment.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.283
I don't know what
he did after that.

33:05.083 --> 33:07.188
What, if anything, did he
say to you before he left?

33:07.285 --> 33:08.730
Objection.
JUDGE FELDMAN: Overruled.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.292
Please answer, Ms. Young.

33:11.489 --> 33:14.595
He told me that if I
said a word to anyone,

33:16.194 --> 33:18.105
I'd be as dead as
those three people.

33:18.163 --> 33:19.369
JACK: Thank you.

33:22.234 --> 33:26.546
You said Mr. Dressier accused you
of sleeping with another man

33:27.072 --> 33:30.713
and threatened to kill him.
Does he always behave this way?

33:31.743 --> 33:33.051
He's very possessive.

33:33.111 --> 33:36.490
But when he's drunk, his jealousy's
out of control, isn't it?

33:37.549 --> 33:38.584
It gets worse.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.561
He rants and raves,
he imagines things?

33:41.086 --> 33:42.087
Yes.

33:42.153 --> 33:44.690
Because in fact, you've never
been unfaithful to him, have you?

33:44.756 --> 33:45.757
No.

33:45.824 --> 33:49.101
So that morning when he
screamed and threatened,

33:50.028 --> 33:51.871
he did so because he was
drunk, isn't that right?

33:51.930 --> 33:52.931
Objection.

33:53.064 --> 33:54.065
Gentlemen.

33:59.938 --> 34:02.817
Your Honor, I'm establishing
a pattern of behavior.

34:03.341 --> 34:06.049
When my client's drunk, he's
insanely jealous and delusional.

34:06.177 --> 34:07.212
So conversely,

34:07.279 --> 34:08.985
when he's insanely jealous
and delusional, he's drunk.

34:09.414 --> 34:11.393
Ms. Young is
an accounts supervisor,

34:11.449 --> 34:13.395
she's not
a behavioral psychologist.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.460
My client's state of mind
is the crux of my case.

34:16.955 --> 34:20.266
Then get an expert. Your line of
questioning is inappropriate.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.161
Now step back.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.103
The jury will disregard
the witness' responses

34:26.164 --> 34:28.041
to Mr. Billings
in their entirety.

34:30.635 --> 34:32.376
I have nothing more,
Your Honor.

34:32.437 --> 34:34.143
JUDGE FELDMAN: Court's recessed
until tomorrow morning.

34:34.206 --> 34:35.206
(GAVEL BANGS)

34:38.208 --> 34:39.620
Lucky break.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.927
You made your point.
Man one on all counts.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.696
Not interested.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.565
ADAM: Man one's a good offer.

34:51.356 --> 34:52.630
You want me to
call his lawyer back?

34:52.791 --> 34:54.498
Your case.
Your idea.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.266
I haven't seen
the fear in his eyes yet.

34:56.393 --> 34:59.398
This is People v. Dressier
you're trying, isn't it?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.476
Long as we're on the same page.

35:06.037 --> 35:08.142
Are you just playing chicken
with Dressier, Jack?

35:08.874 --> 35:10.353
Because it looks
like you and Feldman

35:10.408 --> 35:12.615
are tag-teaming to
commit legal murder.

35:13.178 --> 35:14.350
In your opinion.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.892
It's not even a fair fight. If
Dressier had the flight attendant...

35:16.948 --> 35:19.428
She didn't force-feed
him that scotch

35:19.484 --> 35:21.020
or steer him into those people.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.460
He did that.
He punched the accelerator.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.195
Or he made a mistake!
No!

35:25.791 --> 35:28.795
Anyway, that's for
the jury to decide.

35:28.860 --> 35:29.861
How can they?

35:29.928 --> 35:31.271
They don't have
the whole story.

35:31.329 --> 35:32.706
You're making them accomplices.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.210
So I'm wrong because I want
an appropriate sentence?

35:36.334 --> 35:38.746
Instead of 12 months
at Mount McGregor?

35:41.406 --> 35:43.215
You don't know what
you're talking about.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.352
You won, Jack.

35:46.011 --> 35:47.991
Just call Dressler's lawyer.

35:48.079 --> 35:49.080
The discussion is over, Jamie.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.649
I'm not done!
I am!

35:52.083 --> 35:55.963
This is the District Attorney's office.
We prosecute criminals.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.758
If you could stop thinking
like a defense attorney,

35:58.823 --> 36:00.063
maybe you'd grasp the concept.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.866
I know why I'm here.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.968
I think you're
the one who's forgotten.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.540
The stewardess told me
that she ran out of scotch

36:12.971 --> 36:15.110
and I said I'd drink anything.

36:16.041 --> 36:18.920
And so she went back
into coach and got more.

36:19.244 --> 36:21.588
How many drinks
had you had by then?

36:22.447 --> 36:23.619
Twelve.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.190
I'd lined the little
bottles up on the tray.

36:28.887 --> 36:33.632
I counted them. After that, I don't
remember much. Just flashes.

36:35.327 --> 36:38.831
Susan at the airport,
driving on the expressway.

36:44.302 --> 36:46.407
I often black out
when I drink too much.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.285
How about Mr. Lavalle,

36:49.341 --> 36:52.720
Mr. Galvez and his son, any
recollection of hitting them?

36:52.777 --> 36:53.881
No.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.923
I wish I could say I did.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.088
I'm very sorry I killed them.

37:04.489 --> 37:06.935
I swear I could never
kill anyone intentionally.

37:17.535 --> 37:19.014
Mr. Dressier,

37:22.173 --> 37:25.120
you really don't remember
anything about that morning?

37:26.411 --> 37:27.481
No, I don't.

37:27.545 --> 37:30.719
You don't remember getting
behind the wheel of your car,

37:32.751 --> 37:35.698
even though your driving
privileges had been suspended?

37:36.755 --> 37:37.756
No.

37:37.822 --> 37:41.326
Even though you'd run over
a young girl two years ago

37:41.393 --> 37:43.168
and put her in a coma?

37:43.295 --> 37:45.138
I told you, I don't remember.

37:45.497 --> 37:49.240
So, isn't it
possible at some point

37:49.801 --> 37:53.715
you decided to speed
up and kill Mr. Lavalle

37:53.772 --> 37:54.876
and you just don't remember it?

37:54.940 --> 37:56.010
No!

37:56.341 --> 38:00.619
How can you be so sure, when
you don't remember anything?

38:00.845 --> 38:03.348
I swear if I did
that I'd remember it.

38:03.415 --> 38:04.416
HOW?

38:07.619 --> 38:10.623
You don't even remember
killing Peter Lavalle

38:20.932 --> 38:22.502
or Leon Galvez

38:31.476 --> 38:32.716
or Max Galvez.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.329
You don't remember
them at all, do you?

38:54.966 --> 38:56.377
God.

38:58.603 --> 39:00.014
I didn't mean to.

39:02.540 --> 39:04.110
I was so drunk.

39:08.413 --> 39:12.589
I swear. I'm not a monster.

39:17.255 --> 39:19.861
Please forgive me.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.029
Please?

39:46.284 --> 39:48.764
Mr. Dressier,
we have only your word

39:50.088 --> 39:53.968
that you drank upwards of 12 scotches
on the plane, is that right?

39:57.095 --> 39:58.165
Yes.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.773
Do you know that
you were so drunk

40:02.934 --> 40:04.971
that you couldn't sign
your own name

40:05.036 --> 40:07.038
to a Customs declaration form?

40:09.340 --> 40:12.685
Mr. McCoy, what's the basis
for your question?

40:17.215 --> 40:19.821
I'm offering People's
43 for identification.

40:20.452 --> 40:21.624
Let me see it.

40:37.902 --> 40:40.246
I really don't like surprises,
Mr. McCoy!

40:40.305 --> 40:42.114
May I see the evidence,
Your Honor?

40:42.173 --> 40:43.516
Sure.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.591
This is the statement you got
from the flight attendant?

40:50.081 --> 40:51.116
Yes.

40:52.083 --> 40:54.222
Your Honor,
I have no objection.

40:54.485 --> 40:57.523
This statement cannot be authenticated.
I'm not admitting it.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.269
I'll stipulate to its
authenticity, Your Honor.

41:00.325 --> 41:03.033
If Mr. McCoy also stipulates,
that should be enough.

41:03.094 --> 41:06.200
Mr. McCoy,
before we proceed,

41:08.500 --> 41:11.845
you are familiar with the
provisions of Title I, are you not?

41:13.004 --> 41:14.745
Yes, Your Honor. I am.

41:16.374 --> 41:19.082
Just asking. Excuse me.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.956
What was that all about?
What's Title I?

41:23.348 --> 41:27.455
It's what they now call sections
195 and 195.05 of the penal law.

41:28.052 --> 41:30.965
Official misconduct and obstruction?
He just threatened you.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.735
That's right.

41:33.291 --> 41:37.103
Mr. Billings, does defense
agree to stipulate

41:37.161 --> 41:39.107
to the authenticity
of People's 43?

41:39.430 --> 41:41.034
We certainly do, Your Honor.

41:41.199 --> 41:44.544
JUDGE FELDMAN: Mr. McCoy, are the
People also prepared to so stipulate?

41:44.669 --> 41:45.670
Yes, Your Honor.

41:45.870 --> 41:49.943
People's 43 is admitted.
Go on, Mr. McCoy.

41:53.778 --> 41:56.588
Mr. Dressier, this is a statement
given to the District Attorney

41:56.648 --> 42:00.152
by Gabrielle Barra, the flight
attendant on your flight from Rio.

42:00.685 --> 42:03.825
She states that she served you 15 drinks.
Is that an accurate count?

42:05.023 --> 42:06.696
I only remember the first 12.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.503
She states you
slurred your words

42:08.559 --> 42:09.799
and spilled
a drink on yourself.

42:09.861 --> 42:10.896
Do you recall that?

42:12.063 --> 42:13.064
No.

42:13.131 --> 42:15.441
She states you were
disoriented, at one point

42:15.500 --> 42:16.843
locking yourself
in the washroom

42:16.968 --> 42:19.676
and requiring assistance to get out.
Do you recall that?

42:20.872 --> 42:21.907
No.

42:25.476 --> 42:29.447
Given this statement, is it fair to
say that you were so intoxicated

42:29.514 --> 42:31.653
as to be unable to
think or act rationally?

42:34.185 --> 42:35.255
Yes.

42:38.022 --> 42:39.126
No more questions.

42:44.062 --> 42:46.599
I don't know what happened in there.
You dismantled your case.

42:48.299 --> 42:50.643
I removed the needle from
his arm is what happened.

42:53.004 --> 42:55.416
The offer is
vehicular manslaughter

42:55.473 --> 42:58.215
first degree,
three counts, 5-to-15.

43:00.678 --> 43:02.282
We'll take it.
Send me the papers.

43:02.347 --> 43:04.418
Make no mistake,
Mr. Dressier, I'll be present

43:04.482 --> 43:06.621
for every one of
your parole hearings.

43:12.323 --> 43:14.132
Feldman still has
to sign off on this.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.937
Five years?
You think this is just?

43:19.997 --> 43:21.999
JACK: It's what
the statute provides.

43:22.166 --> 43:25.238
Statute. I don't give a
damn about the statute.

43:26.337 --> 43:28.317
I was presiding
over a landmark case.

43:28.373 --> 43:29.943
You turned it into
an embarrassment.

43:30.008 --> 43:31.146
You made a fool out of me.

43:31.242 --> 43:32.846
Judge...
I had my statements written

43:32.910 --> 43:35.322
for his sentencing, for the
imposition of the death penalty,

43:35.380 --> 43:37.451
you give me a plea
down to a "C" felony.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.061
If by some fluke
you get elected D.A.,

43:40.118 --> 43:42.359
you can lobby to re-write
the drunk-driving laws.

43:42.620 --> 43:46.864
That's cute. This isn't over, McCoy.
I'm not accepting this plea.

43:46.924 --> 43:48.369
You're sending
the case to the jury.

43:48.526 --> 43:49.664
Absolutely not.

43:49.727 --> 43:52.537
Absolutely not. Let me
warn you, counselor.

43:52.597 --> 43:54.838
I know the shell game you played
with that flight attendant.

43:54.899 --> 43:56.606
You either send
this case to the jury,

43:56.668 --> 43:58.341
or you go before
the ethics committee.

43:59.570 --> 44:01.243
That cuts both ways, Judge.
No.

44:01.439 --> 44:03.612
I have absolute
judicial discretion.

44:03.674 --> 44:05.711
Any ruling I made
will hold up to scrutiny

44:05.777 --> 44:07.882
anywhere, any place,
any time, okay.

44:08.045 --> 44:10.286
It's not what's
on the record, Judge.

44:10.915 --> 44:14.556
You tipped your hand in front
of Ms. Ross and myself.

44:17.121 --> 44:18.498
If you're impugning
my judicial...

44:18.556 --> 44:19.864
I don't want to hear it.

44:21.192 --> 44:24.264
I have no excuse for what I did.
Neither do you.

44:26.097 --> 44:30.512
You accept this plea or I'll
go to the ethics committee.

44:43.114 --> 44:46.584
Before I impose sentence, does the
defendant have anything to say?

44:47.819 --> 44:50.459
Just that I'm sorry,
Your Honor.

44:50.955 --> 44:52.491
I'm sorry.

44:54.792 --> 44:57.432
I'm just very sorry.

45:02.967 --> 45:05.504
Pursuant to the plea agreement,
the court sentences you

45:05.570 --> 45:09.245
to a term of not less than five
and to no more than 15 years.

45:09.774 --> 45:12.755
Though I'm bound by statutes,
this sentence in no way reflects

45:12.810 --> 45:14.380
the wanton destruction
you inflicted

45:14.445 --> 45:15.947
on the families
of your victims,

45:16.013 --> 45:18.823
nor the outrage your crimes
aroused in our community.

45:20.818 --> 45:23.355
Your behavior offends us,
Mr. Dressier,

45:24.589 --> 45:26.865
but no more so
than the inadequate penalties

45:26.924 --> 45:28.494
provided by the statutes.

45:31.229 --> 45:32.572
We're adjourned.

45:37.502 --> 45:40.915
ADAM: Good picture of Feldman.
Nice quote.
