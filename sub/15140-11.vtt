00:00.125 --> 00:02.044
[Mac] Previously on
Commander In Chief:

00:02.127 --> 00:04.880
We've received word
that one of our subs is in trouble.

00:04.963 --> 00:06.215
What do we know?

00:06.298 --> 00:10.719
At 0450, the Seattle struck a seamount
14 miles off the coast of North Korea.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.471
Captain Duggan. How is your crew?

00:12.554 --> 00:15.599
[Duggan] A little banged up here,
but managing to hold our own.

00:15.682 --> 00:20.062
If the North Koreans find out, we could
be dealing with a nuclear confrontation.

00:20.145 --> 00:23.482
- Thank you for coming.
- Let's get these young people home.

00:23.565 --> 00:27.569
- Do you think the Chinese will help?
- They're going to ask for a lot.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.113
We need your government's help
to save the men.

00:30.197 --> 00:33.659
I understand. There are certain
purchases we would like to make.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.993
The weapons. No.

00:35.077 --> 00:37.120
I just don't know
what else we have to give.

00:37.204 --> 00:41.166
If you don't want them to buy weapons,
how about letting them sell weapons?

00:41.250 --> 00:43.460
It's a deal. Beijing's accepted it.

00:43.544 --> 00:47.756
They're gonna give us access to their
ships and underwater rescue technology.

00:47.839 --> 00:51.176
- How are things at the office?
- What do you think about coming back?

00:51.260 --> 00:53.345
I'm sorry. I like what I'm doing.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.513
[telephone rings]

00:55.305 --> 01:00.060
Yes. Turn on the news.
Get him on the line as soon as possible.

01:00.143 --> 01:04.022
North Korean State Television
says the American nuclear submarine

01:04.105 --> 01:06.108
was operating within its waters.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.193
- Oh, my God.
- I'm on my way.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.822
[man on TV] North Korea claims
the U.S. nuclear submarine,

01:11.905 --> 01:14.324
allegedly crippled
somewhere in its waters,

01:14.408 --> 01:16.868
was part of a mission
preparing for attack.

01:16.952 --> 01:20.497
North Korean radio and television
are broadcasting orders

01:20.581 --> 01:23.375
for reserve soldiers to report to duty.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.044
We will get you details
as they become available.

01:26.128 --> 01:27.504
[man 2] Thank you, Matt.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.882
So far the Pentagon has only
confirmed that an American submarine

01:30.966 --> 01:33.969
suffered a collision
with an underwater mountain yesterday

01:34.052 --> 01:35.846
and a rescue is being prepared.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.473
If that submarine
is in North Korean waters, though,

01:38.557 --> 01:41.602
the stakes could be much
higher than a risky undersea rescue.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.271
North Korea is,
of course, a nuclear power

01:44.354 --> 01:46.690
that may have
nuclear weapons at its disposal.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.818
We have reports that they
are moving more troops to the border,

01:49.901 --> 01:53.363
and experts are saying this looks
more and more like a precursor to war.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.199
- What happened?
- We will monitor the situationâ€¦

01:56.283 --> 02:00.078
The North Koreans are stepping up air
patrols and making runs into the DMZ.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.580
[Mac] Making runs?

02:01.663 --> 02:05.667
Quick incursions into the air space,
draw in our fighters.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.753
- Playing chicken.
- Rules of engagement for our pilots?

02:08.836 --> 02:11.632
Not to fire unless threatened
or enemy crosses the border.

02:11.715 --> 02:15.427
The more they test us, the more chance
that something happens to escalate.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.347
It looks like they've got every boat
sweeping the waters.

02:18.430 --> 02:21.350
- Are they close to our sub?
- Their search patterns are even,

02:21.433 --> 02:24.311
indicating they know the sub is there,
but don't know where.

02:24.394 --> 02:26.980
So they know exactly
what we told the Chinese.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.316
Why would the Chinese
leak that we have a sub

02:29.399 --> 02:31.443
when we just made a deal with them?

02:31.526 --> 02:32.819
It embarrasses us.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.072
It also escalates tensions
on their border.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.616
A lot of factions at play
in the Chinese government.

02:37.699 --> 02:41.495
If someone didn't like the idea, they
could have talked to the North Koreans.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.871
That makes the most sense.

02:42.954 --> 02:46.541
Now that it's out there that we have
a sub in trouble in North Korean waters,

02:46.625 --> 02:48.293
there's no covert rescue option.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.880
So we have to presume that Chinese
cooperation is up in the air again.

02:51.963 --> 02:55.509
- No word from the Chinese ambassador?
- He's being unreachable.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.553
- How much air do they have left?
- About 33 hours.

02:58.637 --> 03:02.849
I don't care what it takes. We have to
get the Chinese ambassador back in here.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.893
We have to work with Templeton.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.270
We have to make a new deal fast.
Anything else?

03:07.354 --> 03:10.399
Put our troops on high alert,
coordinate with the Japanese,

03:10.482 --> 03:14.236
step up our AWACS patrol so we can
track enemy movements in greater detail.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.405
Put the troops on high alert,
step up AWACS.

03:16.488 --> 03:19.574
Hold off on the Japanese.
I want to talk to their prime minister.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.539
- Where's the vice president?
- On his way to Cheyenne Mountain.

03:25.622 --> 03:29.084
Military and Secret Service thought
he should be in a secure location.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.920
Hey. How about
getting Owen Latimer in here?

03:32.003 --> 03:34.756
- Owen Latimer?
- A friend from University of Richmond.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.175
He's been studying Korea
for what, 20 years?

03:37.259 --> 03:40.262
More like 30.
He knows the region inside and out.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.764
I'll let you know
as soon as the speaker gets here.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.015
- Thank you.
- Ma'am.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.768
- No running in the halls, Vince.
- I'm sorry, I just...

03:46.852 --> 03:47.811
She's kidding.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.731
People run in the halls, trip,
the government gets sued.

03:50.814 --> 03:53.191
The president gets punchy
when she hasn't slept.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.902
The secretary of state
is flying back from Bangalore.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.196
He's given me a list of calls
you should make.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.658
South Korean president, Japanese PM,
EU leadership, Canadian PM.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.535
I might have forgotten that one.

04:03.618 --> 04:07.748
Our ambassador in Seoul needs to talk to
you about evacuating American civilians.

04:07.831 --> 04:09.666
We're not evacuating anybody yet.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.210
- Make the calls. Start with him.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.298
- Jim! Press is already gathering.
- Walk with me.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.507
I need a statement.

04:17.591 --> 04:21.261
I don't think "Secretary of state's
in Bangalore" is gonna fly anymore.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.890
There is a sub in trouble. It was in
the Sea of Japan on a routine exercise

04:24.973 --> 04:26.975
which should in no way
provoke a response.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.895
We're doing everything
we can to save the crew.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.231
We call on North Korea
to respect the laws of maritime rescue.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.650
They're gonna ask
if we're in North Korean waters.

04:35.734 --> 04:39.821
Countries claim a 12-mile offshore
limit. North Korea, a 200 mile limit

04:39.905 --> 04:42.240
not recognized
by the international community.

04:42.324 --> 04:46.703
Not answering, got it. Our sole
focus is on the lives of the crew.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.789
We're talking to everyone who matters.

04:48.872 --> 04:52.083
- Except the North Koreans.
- Don't have a red line to the Oval.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.378
Hey. Are we gonna be OK here?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.672
I mean, we're OK, right?

04:58.757 --> 04:59.841
We're fine.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.261
[door shuts]

05:07.015 --> 05:09.851
Mr. Speaker.
Thank you for getting here so quickly.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.521
I finally got through
to the Chinese ambassador.

05:12.604 --> 05:13.563
And?

05:13.647 --> 05:17.275
He's backpedaling. Says everything's
changed since it's gone public.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.778
Nate. Can we get them
to stick to their agreement

05:19.861 --> 05:22.239
on the use of their
underwater rescue system?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.325
Well, the best case,
they'll probably ask for a better deal.

05:25.408 --> 05:28.203
I'm trying to get him in here
to see you but he's stalling.

05:28.286 --> 05:32.374
He's waiting for Beijing to figure out
where they stand on this thing.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.459
Have we been able
to come up with any way

05:34.543 --> 05:37.546
to get the sailors out
without the Chinese technology?

05:37.629 --> 05:41.925
We've had our crews working nonstop
to repair the submersible rescue module,

05:42.008 --> 05:45.595
but our sub only has 27 hours
of air left and we won't be ready.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.348
We can't get another one there in time,
not ready to go.

05:48.431 --> 05:52.310
So the Chinese are still our
only option. How soon will we know?

05:52.394 --> 05:55.313
Well, they know
we don't have a lot of air left.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.733
They need you an awful lot more
than they need the North Koreans,

05:58.817 --> 05:59.985
so it'll be soon.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.883
Hey, Owen. Thanks for coming down.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.595
I'm so glad to see you, Rod.
Anything for Mac. I mean, the president.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.096
Flight OK?

06:28.179 --> 06:31.766
- Uh, fine. It's just, uh, fast.
- Good.

06:31.850 --> 06:35.270
I... I didn't think they
could go that fast.

06:35.353 --> 06:39.232
- You're not afraid of flying, are you?
- I didn't think I was.

06:39.983 --> 06:43.153
General, what's your take
on the North Korean military position?

06:43.236 --> 06:46.114
Their movements indicate
they're gearing up for attack.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.282
[Prado] So do ours.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.910
Which is why we need
to de-escalate. Back off.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.496
Backing off to those people
means backing down,

06:53.580 --> 06:55.916
and that is not the message
you send to them.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.584
- But war is?
- Oh, please.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.295
Seoul is a city of ten million,
powered by natural gas.

07:00.378 --> 07:04.049
When the North Koreans say they'll
turn it into a fireball, they mean it.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.426
If North Korea pursues a war strategy,

07:06.509 --> 07:09.012
ten million in Seoul
will be the least of our problems.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.474
- Exactly.
- They'll draw us into a conflict.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.894
If they're backed into a corner,
we can't rule out they'll use nukes.

07:19.731 --> 07:23.443
Right now all we have is a lot
of saber rattling and troop movement,

07:23.526 --> 07:25.862
and our guys
are still down there on that sub.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.906
Until somebody starts shooting at us,

07:27.989 --> 07:31.117
our focus is on getting
our sailors home safe.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.161
What's the Korean leadership saying?

07:33.244 --> 07:35.288
All we're hearing is what's on the news.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.083
Is it true the sub's
inside the 12-mile limit?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.835
Owen, there's something
you got to understand.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.589
From now on, every conversation you're
a part of, every document you read,

07:44.673 --> 07:48.718
anything you see or do is classified.
Doesn't matter if the story is public.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.012
Now I don't know
the statutory penalties,

07:51.096 --> 07:54.182
but if you reveal anything
that you learn here,

07:54.265 --> 07:56.351
I expect it's a couple
decades in prison.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.269
I... I assumed.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.313
Well, good. We're in here.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.192
Everyone, this is Owen Latimer.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.445
He's the, uh,
Korea expert we told you about.

08:07.529 --> 08:10.198
[Mac] Welcome.
We'll do introductions when we finish.

08:10.281 --> 08:14.536
For now, suffice it to say, Professor
Latimer has my complete confidence.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.621
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.166
All right. Presuming
we can still get the Chinese

08:20.250 --> 08:23.086
to loan us their rescue technology,
what are our options?

08:23.169 --> 08:26.131
North Koreans are gonna
be all over anyone near their waters,

08:26.214 --> 08:27.590
so there's no covert option.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.260
The Joint Chiefs
have worked out a preliminary plan.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.096
Ma'am, the Seventh Fleet's
already in the Sea of Japan.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.390
Presuming we have
a Chinese rescue module,

08:35.472 --> 08:37.808
we'll need to tether it
to a ship on the surface.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.688
Now, the plan would be to send in Navy
battleships to secure the rescue site,

08:41.770 --> 08:43.815
hold it while we take the men out

08:43.898 --> 08:46.526
and make sure all
classified technology is destroyed

08:46.609 --> 08:49.237
- before we leave the area.
- Too much of a provocation.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.073
Imagine what we would do
if North Korea put warships

08:52.157 --> 08:54.993
eleven miles off the coast
of New York or San Francisco.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.953
- Do you have a better idea?
- Yeah.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.582
Acknowledge that we violated
their sovereign territory. Be humble.

09:00.665 --> 09:05.211
Let them save face. And then ask for
their help in saving our sailors' lives.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.342
Professor Latimer?

09:15.013 --> 09:17.932
Uh... In... in such a scenario,

09:18.016 --> 09:22.020
I... I believe the North Koreans
would make promises to help,

09:22.103 --> 09:25.857
would drag their feet long enough
to ensure the crew died below,

09:25.940 --> 09:30.111
then plunder the sub
for its classified technology.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.867
We have 30,000 troops in South Korea,

09:35.950 --> 09:38.161
two aircraft carrier battle groups,

09:38.244 --> 09:40.830
a Marine Amphibious Ready Group,
not to mention ICBMs.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.624
They don't wanna mess with them.

09:42.707 --> 09:45.627
We have to get the Chinese
rescue technology back into play.

09:45.710 --> 09:49.964
That's the priority. The men
on that sub have 27 hours of air left.

09:50.048 --> 09:52.133
We're not gonna let them die.

10:06.648 --> 10:10.401
The president has spoken with the
leaders of South Korea, Russia, England,

10:10.485 --> 10:12.529
Japan, Germany, China and other nations.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.656
A full list is available
at the press desk.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.700
She's also arranged a call
with the UN Security Council

10:17.784 --> 10:20.245
in advance of their
emergency session tonight.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.163
[all] Kelly!

10:22.247 --> 10:23.832
One at a time, please. Pam?

10:23.915 --> 10:27.335
We understand U.S. troops
in the region have been put on alert.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.463
Does this mean the administration
feels an attack is likely?

10:30.547 --> 10:33.842
And if so, might that be why
the sub was there in the first place?

10:33.925 --> 10:37.137
The alert is in response
to North Korean troop movements.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.932
It's not an indication of anything
other than ordinary military protocol.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.184
[all] Kelly!

10:43.268 --> 10:44.936
Hello, Jayne.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.107
Mrs. Templeton.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.276
Please, come in.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.112
Nathan at the White House?

10:54.195 --> 10:55.989
Since... yesterday.

10:56.072 --> 10:59.409
He did come home last night for
about an hour, but then the news broke

10:59.492 --> 11:02.954
and he went right back.
I don't think he's slept in 36 hours.

11:03.037 --> 11:05.540
Heaven knows
when he last had a decent meal.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.417
The man couldn't be happier.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.460
He's good in a crisis.

11:10.587 --> 11:11.880
They're lucky to have him.

11:11.963 --> 11:15.091
Yes. Yes.

11:15.175 --> 11:19.888
You know what Nathan
is not good at is, um...

11:19.971 --> 11:21.514
...is apologizing.

11:22.765 --> 11:23.766
Proud men never are.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.853
- Sarah...
- Oh, he won't say it, so I will.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.190
He is sorry, truly. He wants you back.

11:31.816 --> 11:32.775
He needs you.

11:32.859 --> 11:36.571
I can give you the names of
a dozen people qualified to run his...

11:36.654 --> 11:38.323
It's not about qualifications.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.159
It's about understanding and trust.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.290
The truth is,
I... don't want to go back.

11:47.373 --> 11:52.253
I like this job. Frankly, I could never
make this kind of money on the Hill.

11:52.337 --> 11:57.091
And I'm just starting to get my credit
card bills paid off. It feels good.

11:57.175 --> 12:00.720
Right now, at the White House,
they're trying to prevent a war.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.350
You could be there with Nathan,
right in the thick of it.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.771
Or you can sit behind
this expensive glass desk

12:09.854 --> 12:13.733
and watch it on television.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.535
By the way,

12:24.619 --> 12:27.372
we never had this conversation.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.756
Helping with a covert
rescue operation is one thing,

12:36.839 --> 12:40.468
but publicly putting our military
technology in North Korean waters...

12:40.551 --> 12:42.345
It's an at-sea rescue.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.305
Of a U.S. nuclear attack submarine.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.099
What does Beijing want?

12:46.849 --> 12:49.060
Lift your embargo
on our weapons imports.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.645
That's not going to happen.

12:50.728 --> 12:55.608
You ask us to act like allies,
we ask you to treat us like allies.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.902
[laughs] Allies.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.363
How did North Korea
find out we had a sub there?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.782
It had to be a leak from your end, ally.

13:02.865 --> 13:07.328
We cannot control every faction
inside our government.

13:07.412 --> 13:11.332
Which is why Congress will never agree
to lift the weapons ban. Mr. Speaker?

13:11.416 --> 13:13.084
It's not realistic.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.380
Then neither is our involvement
with your rescue operation.

13:17.463 --> 13:20.174
The Chinese government
is gonna let our sailors die?

13:20.258 --> 13:22.302
We were ready to help. We had a deal.

13:22.385 --> 13:25.388
But you must understand
we cannot publicly take part

13:25.471 --> 13:28.891
in a U.S. military
operation in North Korea.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.852
What if it isn't public?

13:32.854 --> 13:33.855
I'm sorry?

13:33.938 --> 13:37.900
Now that the North Koreans know,
we don't need your boats as cover.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.863
We can't get our undersea rescue module
to the area in time, we need yours.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.906
Let us use it covertly.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.408
The technology is complex.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.619
From what I understand, it would
take months to train new pilots.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.663
We would need to use your pilots,

13:50.747 --> 13:53.291
but we would tether your module
to an American ship.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.543
No one would need
to know you were involved.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.838
We'd provide the full protection
of the United States military

13:58.921 --> 14:00.631
and guarantee deniability.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.925
And if it leaks out
that we were involved?

14:03.009 --> 14:07.180
If the rescue works, our military
will be happy to take full credit.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.601
And you will stand
by your original deal?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.103
Weapons exports, not imports, yes.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.855
The original deal would stand.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.024
It's still a big gain for China.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.985
[speaks Chinese]

14:24.906 --> 14:26.574
I need to check with Beijing,

14:26.657 --> 14:28.785
but I will do my best
to get them on board.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.579
Now I will stand by the original deal.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.040
If the rescue doesn't happen,
it's off the table.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.917
Those men are running out of air.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.960
I will get back to you
as soon as possible.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.296
We can get you
to a secure line in the building.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.381
Very good.

14:41.464 --> 14:45.426
Tell your leaders that we appreciate
their help in saving these lives.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.845
- They will not be forgotten.
- Thank you.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.974
I believe I can get the right people
in Beijing to agree to this,

14:52.058 --> 14:56.104
but if the U.S. troops fire on
North Korean troops without provocation,

14:56.187 --> 14:57.563
China will not be with you.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.440
I can assure you that will not happen.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.360
- Nathan.
- [speaks Chinese]

15:04.487 --> 15:06.197
[sighs]

15:06.280 --> 15:08.449
You think he can get them on board?

15:08.533 --> 15:11.119
He has a very good feel
for the people there.

15:11.202 --> 15:14.247
I told him it was
the best deal he could get.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.457
They want the deal.

15:16.541 --> 15:21.129
Now we have to pray that their rescue
technology works with our sub hatch.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.714
Madam President,
you're needed in the Sit Room.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.470
[man] Ten-hut!

15:29.554 --> 15:33.182
Madam President, 14 minutes ago
five North Korean jet fighters scrambled

15:33.266 --> 15:35.726
to engage one of our AWACS
off the coast of Wonsan.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.813
Fighters responded,
but the AWACS took fire.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.107
- Casualties?
- Injuries, no deaths.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.526
The plane is heading back
to Pusan under escort.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.361
Madam President,

15:45.445 --> 15:48.239
they turned this into a shooting war.
We need a response.

15:57.832 --> 16:01.043
[woman on TV] No details yet
on injuries to the U.S. flight crew,

16:01.127 --> 16:05.047
but we have been told that the
damaged plane has landed safely.

16:05.131 --> 16:09.719
[man] What is the likelihood
of a nuclear confrontation here?

16:09.802 --> 16:12.430
[woman] Well,
North Korea is a nuclear power.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.683
We know they have
the fissile material, the fuel

16:15.766 --> 16:18.186
to produce at least six to eight bombs.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.730
Whether or not
they have done so is unclear.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.567
But it is disturbing we haven't
heard at all from President Allen

16:24.650 --> 16:27.695
as the situation continues to escalate.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.907
She's playing with fire here.
Nuclear fire.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.038
[man on speaker phone]
My XO has wired the boat for demolition.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.290
If we get off of here
we will be able to destroy

16:39.373 --> 16:41.292
all classified data and technology.

16:41.375 --> 16:45.129
We appreciate your crew
keeping focus, Captain Duggan.

16:45.213 --> 16:46.714
Must be tense down there.

16:46.797 --> 16:50.468
Thank you, Madam President. We're
following the situation as best we can.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.846
- We heard a plane's been hit?
- You just worry about your men.

16:53.930 --> 16:57.558
I just wanted to let you know,
I've spoken with the entire crew.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.560
We volunteered for this mission.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.897
If a rescue isn't feasible
or costs are too high,

17:02.980 --> 17:04.941
we're ready to do what we need to do.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.527
- We're not there yet, captain.
- Yes, ma'am.

17:07.609 --> 17:11.781
Know that the sub's wired and we can
destroy her at any time on your order.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.617
We're working hard to get you home.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.246
Some of my men have asked,
if we get that order,

17:18.329 --> 17:21.082
if you could tell our
families that it wasn't a choice.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.500
Say it was an accident.

17:23.416 --> 17:27.171
We're doing everything we can
to see that it doesn't come to that.

17:27.255 --> 17:30.091
Thank you, Madam President.
We'll stand by for orders.

17:31.467 --> 17:33.219
[electronic beep]

17:37.974 --> 17:40.142
[speaks Chinese]

17:43.521 --> 17:46.274
I've just spoken
with the Chinese ambassador.

17:46.357 --> 17:50.778
We have their rescue system and their
pilots, covertly, but we have it now.

17:50.861 --> 17:51.821
Good news.

17:51.904 --> 17:56.742
Now, the Joint Chiefs want an immediate
response to the shooting of our plane.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.620
There are missile batteries
we can take out

17:59.704 --> 18:02.665
as well as a couple of their
warships we can sink on your orders

18:02.748 --> 18:04.875
with minimal operational risk.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.503
If we're about to send
in ships to rescue the Seattle,

18:07.587 --> 18:11.757
I'm not sure a "who can sink more
boats faster" contest is the best move.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.010
[laughing]

18:14.093 --> 18:16.887
It'll be no contest, Jim.
We will crush them.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.265
I wish I had your confidence, sir.

18:19.348 --> 18:22.852
Let's table the AWACS shooting for now.
I want to focus on the rescue.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.854
The shooting makes it very clear

18:24.937 --> 18:27.940
the North Koreans will use force
to keep us off their coast.

18:28.024 --> 18:32.069
If we go in for this rescue, we have
to be prepared for confrontation.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.654
That could mean war.

18:34.572 --> 18:37.408
Let's say it's war.
What's the worst-case scenario?

18:37.491 --> 18:39.869
The North Koreans
have a million man army,

18:39.952 --> 18:43.497
chemical and biological weapons,
maybe nukes, thousands of missiles.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.333
Worst-case, full-scale conflict,

18:45.416 --> 18:48.836
we have 300,000 to 500,000
military casualties inside 90 days.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.713
And civilians?

18:50.796 --> 18:53.382
It's 50 kilometers
between Pyongyang and Seoul.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.926
33 million people live there.
Pick a number.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.095
You saying
we should abandon the Seattle,

18:58.179 --> 19:01.140
making me the president
who ordered the only mass suicide

19:01.223 --> 19:02.725
in U.S. military history?

19:02.808 --> 19:06.020
- I'm urging caution.
- Don't hedge. I need answers.

19:06.103 --> 19:09.148
Are you recommending that
we destroy the sub and kill the crew?

19:12.943 --> 19:14.654
I don't like it any more than you do.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.323
But it might bring us
from the brink of something worse.

19:17.406 --> 19:21.369
- If there is a chance of a rescue...
- That's all there is, is a chance.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.830
We could send in ships,
start a war and still lose the sub.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.166
I'm with you.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.752
I think we should go in after our men.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.797
If North Korea attacks, we fight back.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.926
And I'll bet my bottom dollar we'll be
in Pyongyang by the end of the week.

19:37.009 --> 19:41.722
But if we back down, it'll be a stain
on our reputation for decades.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.015
We may never recover.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.810
- I don't agree.
- I do.

19:45.893 --> 19:50.147
If you back down to bullies today,
there's going to be another tomorrow.

19:50.231 --> 19:52.566
Most of the bullies
don't have nuclear weapons.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.319
Come on. I don't go along
with that doomsday scenario.

19:55.403 --> 19:58.114
North Korea's million-man army,

19:58.197 --> 20:02.076
it's a million starving men
suffering under a brutal dictatorship.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.495
The key is China.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.623
The ambassador warned us
that Beijing would not support us

20:07.707 --> 20:10.251
in an unprovoked military action.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.462
But if North Korea
attacks our rescue ships,

20:13.546 --> 20:16.924
unquestionably,
that will be a provocation.

20:17.007 --> 20:20.136
And I'm convinced that China
will be with us when we respond.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.263
In a war with North Korea?

20:22.346 --> 20:27.435
Every year we let North Korea get away
with this crap, they get stronger.

20:27.518 --> 20:30.563
In five years or ten years,
they could have a missile

20:30.646 --> 20:35.109
that could hit San Francisco or Chicago
or New York, for heaven's sakes.

20:35.192 --> 20:38.946
The Japanese prime minister's on the
line. There's a translator in the Oval.

20:39.029 --> 20:42.199
- Excuse me, everyone.
- Ma'am.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.536
[speaks Japanese]

20:47.538 --> 20:49.957
Mr. Prime Minister,
thank you for calling again.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.586
- [man on phone speaks Japanese]
- [woman] Of course, Madam President.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.964
I understand your military leadership
is doing an excellent job

20:57.047 --> 20:59.550
of coordinating
our joint defense preparations.

20:59.633 --> 21:03.512
- [man speaks Japanese]
- I understand your desire to...

21:03.596 --> 21:06.098
...do all you can
for your trapped sailors.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.602
But I assume the military
preparations are... cautionary.

21:09.685 --> 21:12.688
Sir, at this point
I'm keeping all my options open.

21:12.772 --> 21:16.484
- [man speaks Japanese]
- Madam President, may I remind you

21:16.567 --> 21:20.070
that while Korean missiles
probably cannot reach your country,

21:20.154 --> 21:21.864
they can easily reach mine.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.282
I am aware of that.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.618
There is a great deal of concern here.

21:25.701 --> 21:29.371
The airports are crowded with people
trying to get out of the country.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.582
We are closing the Nikkei tomorrow.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.877
The consequences of your actions
are already considerable.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.339
We are proceeding
as responsibly as possible.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.841
I know you are. But with respect,

21:40.925 --> 21:43.344
you govern from thousands of miles away.

21:43.427 --> 21:47.181
It is our people
who would die in this war.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.642
- I know that.
- Thank you.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.602
We await your decisions.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.274
Anything else, ma'am?

21:57.983 --> 21:59.443
No, Randy. Thank you.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.498
There are concerns,
but the overwhelming response

22:12.581 --> 22:15.209
in the international community
has been supportive.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.252
Yeah?

22:16.335 --> 22:18.170
I got a call from The Times.

22:18.254 --> 22:22.049
There's a report that we've ordered an
evacuation of Americans in South Korea.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.509
There's been no such order.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.136
Here's the communication plan
Gardner asked for.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.805
Great. Thanks.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.391
- Wait.
- Hey. You need another set of hands?

22:30.474 --> 22:32.518
Yeah, there's nothing on here for radio.

22:32.601 --> 22:34.562
- There's no surrogate list.
- I got it.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.398
What are you going to do?
Start typing like an intern?

22:37.481 --> 22:39.984
- Don't worry about it. You have calls.
- Thanks.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.028
I just heard from my aunt in San Diego

22:43.112 --> 22:46.740
who asked if she should buy duct tape
and plastic sheeting to seal windows.

22:46.824 --> 22:50.327
My mom says her neighbors are
saying they should stock up on iodine

22:50.411 --> 22:52.329
in case there's radiation poisoning.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.206
You think it's gonna happen?

22:54.290 --> 22:57.334
From the looks I'm seeing
on the guys outside the Cabinet Room,

22:57.418 --> 22:59.003
I'd say it's 50-50.

23:15.519 --> 23:16.520
Hey.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.648
Thank you.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.942
What are you doing here?
How'd you get in?

23:22.026 --> 23:25.070
I told them
I was the speaker's chief of staff.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.365
Oh, you did, did you?

23:29.450 --> 23:31.410
I know that you think I betrayed you.

23:31.493 --> 23:34.371
[sighs] I never thought
that talking to Jim Gardner

23:34.455 --> 23:38.042
would cause you
the embarrassment that it has.

23:38.125 --> 23:39.710
And for that, I am sorry.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.212
Truly.

23:43.047 --> 23:46.634
But if we can put this behind us,
I'd like to work for you again.

23:46.717 --> 23:49.762
Done. Behind us. Gone.

23:49.845 --> 23:53.223
All morning I've been thinking
of how much fun you were missing.

23:53.307 --> 23:55.267
How you would've loved to be in on this.

23:55.351 --> 23:59.229
I love working with you.
I'm really glad you're back.

23:59.313 --> 24:00.814
[electronic beeping]

24:00.898 --> 24:02.858
We've been talking as if it's either-or:

24:02.942 --> 24:04.944
Abandon the sub or go to war.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.987
What if we don't do either?

24:07.071 --> 24:11.116
What if we send the rescue mission
in without a battleship escort?

24:11.200 --> 24:14.370
Make clear we have no plan to do
anything except get the crew out?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.705
No, no, no.
They shot down an unarmed plane.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.667
For sure they will sink the ships
if they're not defended.

24:19.750 --> 24:23.170
Is there anything we can offer
the North Koreans? A show of good faith?

24:23.253 --> 24:24.672
Good faith, no.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.675
But they could use hard currency.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.218
Dollars for goods.

24:29.301 --> 24:33.013
Are... are you suggesting
that we pay North Korea money?

24:33.097 --> 24:35.474
As in what, blackmail? Ransom?

24:35.557 --> 24:37.351
I... I was just answering a question.

24:37.434 --> 24:41.897
Madam President, it's possible that
you will have the unique opportunity

24:41.981 --> 24:44.984
to deal, once and for all,
with a rogue nation

24:45.067 --> 24:48.570
that has plagued us
for over half a century.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.823
This is a country
that's enslaved its people

24:50.906 --> 24:53.325
and threatened its neighbor,
threatened us.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.036
Do you think it's appropriate
for you to go to them,

24:56.120 --> 25:00.207
hat in one hand and a dollar
in the other, and ask them for a favor?

25:00.290 --> 25:02.376
No small favor to prevent a war.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.003
[woman] I doubt it can work.

25:04.086 --> 25:07.715
It's a tenet of North Korean propaganda
that they can defeat us in battle.

25:07.798 --> 25:10.718
And not just on the peninsula,
but here in the United States.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.554
In some ways I think they want a war.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.431
Owen, do you think that's true?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.683
Do... do the North Koreans want war?

25:17.766 --> 25:21.145
No. They want us
to think they want war.

25:21.228 --> 25:24.440
But... but they know
they have more to lose than we do.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.108
They hate us.

25:26.191 --> 25:30.571
They want to humiliate us,
but... but they're not suicidal.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.282
So if we send in
our rescue ships with no cover,

25:33.365 --> 25:37.369
make clear we have no intention to do
anything but get our sailors out alive,

25:37.453 --> 25:40.664
will the North Koreans
withdraw their navy and back down?

25:43.167 --> 25:45.002
No one can guarantee that.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.591
The sub crew
has about 17 hours of air left.

25:50.674 --> 25:53.886
If we don't do something soon,
it's gonna be too late.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.346
Let's get the North Korean rep
to the UN in here.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.098
[police siren]

25:59.391 --> 26:03.270
I can assure you,
our nation has both the military power

26:03.353 --> 26:06.398
and the political will
to defeat the United States

26:06.482 --> 26:08.233
in any war of aggression.

26:08.317 --> 26:10.652
We have no intention
of attacking your country.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.696
You already have attacked our country.

26:12.780 --> 26:15.324
Your planes have invaded our airspace.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.493
Your nuclear submarine is in our waters.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.745
With due respect, Mr. Nang,

26:19.828 --> 26:23.290
if the United States
attacked North Korea, you'd know it.

26:23.373 --> 26:27.127
You're here because we want to do what
we can to prevent that from happening.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.463
You can prevent it very simply.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.299
Stand down your military,
withdraw from our borders

26:32.382 --> 26:35.052
and return to the status quo.

26:35.135 --> 26:39.181
South Korea is already
an occupied U.S. outpost.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.141
We won't become another.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.268
I want to send a message
to your leadership.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.020
I hear they trust your integrity.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.897
I am honored to believe so.

26:46.980 --> 26:50.275
Good. This is the message
from the United States of America:

26:50.359 --> 26:53.403
We are going in to
save the crew of the USS Seattle.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.989
Our rescue operation
will take us slightly within

26:56.073 --> 26:58.200
your 12-mile maritime limit.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.619
Our rescue vessels will be unarmed.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.372
We have no intention
of attacking your nation.

27:03.455 --> 27:08.168
But we will consider any aggression
against our rescue as an act of war.

27:08.252 --> 27:11.463
Your incursion into
sovereign waters will, I assure you,

27:11.547 --> 27:14.133
be considered
an act of war by our nation.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.677
You shot down
an American military plane.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.846
I'm under a lot of pressure to respond.

27:18.929 --> 27:22.266
You respect our rescue mission,
I'll let it go.

27:22.349 --> 27:25.727
I will also guarantee
your UN food aid continues

27:25.811 --> 27:28.480
and I will arrange
for a payment, in cash,

27:28.564 --> 27:31.066
of 500 million dollars to your country.

27:31.150 --> 27:35.821
We'll call it humanitarian aid,
but there will be no strings attached.

27:37.948 --> 27:41.577
You are offering us
500 million dollars in cash?

27:41.660 --> 27:44.997
This is not a negotiation,
and we don't have time to be polite.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.124
But I believe neither of us wants a war.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.836
Our leadership will be getting
its own pressure to respond,

27:50.919 --> 27:53.839
to fire on your
so-called rescue mission.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.259
Tell your leadership they don't
want to put me in that position.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.719
And if they do?

28:00.095 --> 28:04.474
We will retaliate with the full force
of the United States military.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.649
Thank you, Madam President.

28:22.743 --> 28:25.579
[man talking on TV]

28:25.662 --> 28:27.414
The North Korean UN rep just left.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.750
Rod, she'd like you
to join her in the Oval.

28:29.833 --> 28:30.959
Thanks.

28:31.043 --> 28:34.004
- I'll be in my office.
- I'll let you know if she needs you.

28:37.507 --> 28:40.093
Mr. Speaker, would you care to join us?

28:40.177 --> 28:41.553
Thank you.

28:41.637 --> 28:42.721
What do we do now?

28:44.223 --> 28:47.684
We wait. Pray they blink first.

28:53.523 --> 28:56.735
I sat in this office with Teddy Bridges

28:56.818 --> 28:59.988
when we ran the raid on the Khyber Pass.

29:00.072 --> 29:03.116
The waiting is the worst part.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.369
The deciding isn't so easy either.

29:07.246 --> 29:11.500
Madam President, our rescue vessels
are a half hour from the 12-mile limit.

29:11.583 --> 29:15.254
The North Korean warships are lining up
to meet them in battle formation.

29:15.337 --> 29:16.922
Their orders are to keep moving?

29:17.005 --> 29:21.009
Yes. Our guess is if anything's going
to happen, they'll wait for us to cross.

29:21.093 --> 29:23.053
Thank you. Please keep me posted.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.972
Yes, ma'am.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.896
Maybe we should say a prayer.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.496
[woman on TV] Major businesses
are closed throughout Asia today,

29:49.579 --> 29:52.457
and here in South Korea
local markets are emptied

29:52.541 --> 29:57.629
by people stocking up on water,
canned foods and first-aid supplies.

29:57.713 --> 30:01.508
South Korean and American soldiers
wait by the demilitarized zone.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.011
In the cities, the streets are empty.

30:05.095 --> 30:08.515
Families have cleared out old
bomb shelters from the Cold War era

30:08.598 --> 30:10.726
that had been turned into storage units,

30:10.809 --> 30:13.562
leaving bicycles,
laundry machines, file cabinets

30:13.645 --> 30:18.275
and other possessions outside
so they can huddle together inside.

30:20.319 --> 30:23.322
- Mrs. Allen.
- Oh, Mr. Speaker.

30:23.405 --> 30:24.948
- Excuse me.
- Everything OK?

30:25.032 --> 30:27.868
Actually, I came down here
to ask you exactly that.

30:27.951 --> 30:31.663
Um, well, Amy can't sleep,
but she's going to be all right.

30:31.747 --> 30:32.706
Sorry.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.875
There's nothing
to be done here. So I'll go.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.962
You know what? They've barely seen
me for two days. I'll go talk to them.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.088
Oh.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.257
"Each morning,
as the sun rose from the East,

30:42.341 --> 30:45.385
Ping and his mother and his father
and sisters and brothers

30:45.469 --> 30:48.180
and aunts and uncles
and his 42 cousins all..."

30:48.263 --> 30:50.599
Hey. What are you still doing up?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.517
I can't sleep.

30:52.601 --> 30:55.395
I told her I'd read to her.
The news is scaring her.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.398
Yeah. Thanks, baby.
You having nightmares?

30:58.482 --> 31:01.860
On the news they said
there might be a nuclear bomb.

31:01.943 --> 31:05.238
They're talking about someplace
very far away. We're safe here.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.241
What about the people over there?

31:08.325 --> 31:11.578
I'm going to do everything I can
to make sure nothing bad happens.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.456
OK? All right. Try to get some sleep.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.500
- Mmm.
- [knocking]

31:16.583 --> 31:20.545
Hey. Sorry. Vince is here.
They need you downstairs.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.422
We'll finish putting her to bed.

31:22.506 --> 31:24.424
- Thanks, baby.
- Mom...

31:31.014 --> 31:32.432
Good night.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.857
[Jim] Madam President,
the UN ambassador would like a word.

31:40.941 --> 31:43.568
- We have him on a secure line.
- Where are our ships?

31:43.652 --> 31:47.239
- About to cross the 12-mile limit.
- North Korean warships standing firm.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.616
- Put him on the speaker.
- [electronic beep]

31:49.699 --> 31:52.536
Representative Nang,
this is President Allen.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.455
[Nang] I have passed your offer
along to our leadership.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.124
- They have a request.
- Go ahead.

31:57.207 --> 32:00.001
They would like you to make
a public apology to our nation.

32:00.085 --> 32:02.546
Acknowledge what you did wrong.

32:09.636 --> 32:14.224
Our rescue mission proceeds without
incident, you'll have your apology.

32:14.307 --> 32:17.227
I will let them know.
Thank you, Madam President.

32:17.310 --> 32:18.437
Thank you.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.440
What do we tell our rescue ships?

32:21.523 --> 32:22.774
The order stands.

32:27.028 --> 32:30.115
They're heading for a
North Korean battle fleet. Maybe we...

32:30.198 --> 32:33.368
They have the orders,
I haven't heard her change them.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.245
[telephone rings]

32:36.580 --> 32:39.875
NSA reports intercepting
new commands to the Korean warships.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.962
They're being told to give our rescue
operation a one-kilometer working area.

32:44.045 --> 32:47.883
Getting reports from field recon.
North Korean warships are moving.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.050
Which direction?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.428
[electronic beeping]

32:51.511 --> 32:52.637
Away.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.182
They're backing off.
Letting our rescue ships in.

32:55.265 --> 32:58.518
How long before we know
if the rescue is working?

32:58.602 --> 33:01.897
They have to drop anchor,
bring down the rescue module.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.690
We don't know if the hatches open.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.275
- How long?
- Six hours.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.445
All right. Let's not celebrate yet.

33:11.114 --> 33:14.784
[distant bell ringing]

33:18.580 --> 33:19.789
How long has it been?

33:19.873 --> 33:22.459
It's been five minutes
since the last time you asked.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.587
I'm gonna guess six hours
and ten minutes. Water?

33:25.670 --> 33:27.589
You should get some sleep.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.257
At least go to the residence.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.551
Someone will call
the minute there's news.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.762
I know. You're right.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.974
I just... I can't leave the desk
while they're still down there.

33:39.476 --> 33:41.269
- Kids up yet?
- No. Just your mom.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.355
She said she'd call when they're awake.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.442
I keep thinking...

33:47.526 --> 33:50.195
...if Templeton
were president right now,

33:50.278 --> 33:52.155
we might very well be at war.

33:52.239 --> 33:56.159
Yeah, well, it's reason enough
to be president right there.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.995
[quietly] Yeah.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.331
And reason enough to run again.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.793
- Hmm.
- [footsteps]

34:04.876 --> 34:08.380
[knocking] Madam President,
they want you in the Sit Room.

34:17.472 --> 34:19.391
[murmuring]

34:19.474 --> 34:20.516
Ten-hut!

34:20.600 --> 34:24.062
Madam President, we have a secure
transmission from the USS Brighton,

34:24.145 --> 34:25.605
the lead rescue ship.

34:25.688 --> 34:28.900
They've asked that we put it through
when we have you in the room.

34:28.984 --> 34:32.279
USS Brighton, you have secure
transmission with the president

34:32.362 --> 34:34.614
of the United States.

34:34.697 --> 34:38.743
Madam President, this is Captain
Andrew Duggan of the USS Seattle,

34:38.827 --> 34:41.830
radioing in to report that all
classified material on our ship

34:41.913 --> 34:45.875
has been destroyed and our entire crew
is now safely aboard the USS Brighton.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.168
[murmuring]

34:47.252 --> 34:49.963
It's very good to see your face,
Captain Duggan.

34:50.045 --> 34:52.340
It's good to be seen, Madam President.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.967
You had us a bit worried for awhile.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.678
We knew you'd come get us.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.222
It's an honor to serve under you,
Madam President.

34:59.306 --> 35:00.515
Thank you, captain.

35:00.599 --> 35:04.728
You tell everyone there,
you all have made us very proud today.

35:05.854 --> 35:09.608
General Krieger, let's turn those ships
around and get our sailors home.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.781
[man] Excellent work, ma'am.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.495
Madam President...

35:23.330 --> 35:25.415
...we just wanted to say...

35:25.498 --> 35:28.335
...thank you
for your leadership through this.

35:28.418 --> 35:30.920
We're honored to serve under you too.

35:31.004 --> 35:33.590
- Thank you, general.
- Thank you, Madam President.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.759
- Thank you.
- Madam President.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.638
How do you want
to make the announcement?

35:39.721 --> 35:43.141
Release the video uplink to the press.
Let them know the crew is safe.

35:43.224 --> 35:46.353
We'll move the presidential
press conference a day early.

35:46.436 --> 35:47.395
Great.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.439
I'll want to talk
to world leaders first.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.232
- I'll set it up.
- Congratulations.

35:51.316 --> 35:53.193
I really appreciate all your help.

35:53.276 --> 35:57.072
It was a brilliant ploy,
telling them you'd apologize.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.698
It wasn't a ploy.

35:58.782 --> 36:03.912
You're... you're not actually going
to apologize to the North Koreans?

36:03.995 --> 36:05.205
I promised I would.

36:06.331 --> 36:11.127
With all due respect, ma'am,
as a strategy, it was brilliant.

36:11.211 --> 36:14.130
But a public apology will do nothing
but make you look weak.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.174
I want them to know they can trust us.

36:16.257 --> 36:18.176
Better they should fear us.

36:18.259 --> 36:21.346
They already fear us.
A little trust won't hurt.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.974
Well, let's hope you're right.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.771
I want to thank you for allowing
me to be a part of this process.

36:29.854 --> 36:31.648
- Thank you.
- Mr. Speaker.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.692
Good morning.

36:33.775 --> 36:37.320
[Duggan] ...all classified material
on our ship has been destroyed

36:37.404 --> 36:40.865
and our entire crew is now
safely aboard the USS Brighton.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.409
[man] Yeah!

36:42.492 --> 36:45.161
Remember how I said
the president needs to do something

36:45.245 --> 36:47.497
to clarify her image
with the American people?

36:47.580 --> 36:49.916
- Done?
- Done and done.

36:49.999 --> 36:53.378
Money can't buy this kind of PR hit.
I mean, this is...

36:53.461 --> 36:56.756
...a very good day. I mean,
do you realize how good this is? It's...

36:59.634 --> 37:01.386
It's a good day.

37:03.513 --> 37:04.931
OK, then.

37:05.014 --> 37:07.308
When our sub got into trouble,
it was too close

37:07.392 --> 37:10.854
to the sovereign waters of North Korea.
That was a mistake.

37:10.937 --> 37:15.442
As commander in chief of the United
States military, I take responsibility.

37:15.525 --> 37:16.693
[clamoring]

37:16.776 --> 37:19.612
Are you saying
the North Koreans share no blame?

37:19.696 --> 37:22.574
This isn't a time for blame.
It's a time for moving forward.

37:22.657 --> 37:26.786
And in that spirit, I would like
to offer the people of North Korea

37:26.870 --> 37:30.081
my personal apology
for our part in this incident.

37:30.165 --> 37:31.541
And my pledge to do better.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.835
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- Roger.

37:33.918 --> 37:37.172
Thank you, ma'am. North Korea
is a totalitarian dictatorship.

37:37.255 --> 37:41.593
They shot down a plane. Aren't they
the ones who should pledge to do better?

37:41.676 --> 37:45.054
We don't see eye to eye on most
issues with North Korean leaders,

37:45.138 --> 37:48.266
but today we saw eye to eye
on the most important issue:

37:48.349 --> 37:50.143
Peace.

37:50.226 --> 37:53.354
I think we can all be proud of that.
Thank you.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.899
[all] Madam President!

37:59.527 --> 38:02.572
I know you all probably
have two million calls each to return.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.491
We just want to grab you for a minute.

38:04.574 --> 38:07.327
It's more like three million,
but you're the president.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.078
Speaking of which...

38:09.913 --> 38:13.291
I wanted to tell you all
how proud I am of you,

38:13.374 --> 38:15.919
of us, of this team.

38:16.002 --> 38:19.923
We accomplished something
amazing in the last 48 hours.

38:20.006 --> 38:23.176
And I can't help but feel

38:23.259 --> 38:26.429
that, uh, there's so much
more we could accomplish.

38:26.513 --> 38:27.597
You're going to run.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.099
[chuckling]

38:30.183 --> 38:33.019
I think this team
deserves another four years.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.188
At least.

38:35.271 --> 38:37.315
Absolutely.

38:39.692 --> 38:40.693
Thank you.

38:40.777 --> 38:43.112
When our sub got into trouble,
it was too close

38:43.196 --> 38:46.449
to the sovereign waters
of North Korea. That was a mistake.

38:46.533 --> 38:47.909
Hey.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.078
I thought you were
gonna go straight home.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.664
[exhales] I can't sleep
when it's light out.

38:55.959 --> 38:57.585
How was the press conference?

38:57.669 --> 38:59.838
She's spinning it pretty well right now.

38:59.921 --> 39:01.756
Yeah.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.550
How was she in the crisis?

39:04.717 --> 39:06.302
Well...

39:07.428 --> 39:11.224
...the good news is she did
a hell of a job for the country.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.725
What's the bad news?

39:12.809 --> 39:16.521
The bad news is she did
a hell of a job for the country.

39:19.983 --> 39:23.444
She's not gonna be easy to beat.

39:23.528 --> 39:25.947
[Mac] And when the last chick
was safe in its nest,

39:26.030 --> 39:29.826
Ricky winged up into the sky
where he found his friends

39:29.909 --> 39:32.203
waiting to take him home.

39:32.287 --> 39:34.289
Could you read me another one?

39:34.372 --> 39:36.875
No, but good try.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.043
Bedtime.

39:39.127 --> 39:41.087
Goodnight, baby. Mmm.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.381
Is everything really OK now?

39:43.464 --> 39:46.259
Mm-hm.
Just like the chicks in their nest.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.969
Promise.

39:56.936 --> 39:59.731
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.775
- You OK?
- Yeah. I just, um...

40:02.859 --> 40:05.570
[exhales] I just wanted
to tell you I'm...

40:07.030 --> 40:08.323
I'm really proud of you.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.575
Thank you.

40:10.658 --> 40:13.369
[exhales] I'm proud of you too,
you know.

40:15.038 --> 40:18.249
It's not like I just brought
us back from the brink of nuclear war.

40:19.250 --> 40:20.835
That was pretty good, wasn't it?

40:20.919 --> 40:23.087
Yeah, well,
don't let it go to your head.

40:24.047 --> 40:27.550
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night.

40:28.718 --> 40:30.929
I smell cookies.

40:31.012 --> 40:34.849
Oh. You always liked
a snack after a long day.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.644
It's been a long couple of days.

40:37.727 --> 40:40.313
Hey! Hands off.

40:40.396 --> 40:42.899
I made you some hot cocoa.
Help you sleep.

40:42.982 --> 40:43.983
Thank you.

40:44.067 --> 40:47.028
You always had fresh cookies
waiting when I got out of school.

40:47.111 --> 40:50.615
Mmm. You know why?

40:50.698 --> 40:52.492
Because you're the best mom ever?

40:52.575 --> 40:55.161
Of course, that.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.746
You'd come home for the cookies.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.164
Hmm.

40:58.247 --> 41:02.001
Tell me about your day. I'd have you
at the table for ten minutes.

41:02.085 --> 41:04.087
It was our special time together.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.340
Every day. Guaranteed.

41:07.423 --> 41:09.008
[chuckling]

41:10.677 --> 41:13.096
So, how was your day?

41:16.891 --> 41:20.478
The kids were really freaked.
Thanks for taking care of them.

41:20.561 --> 41:23.272
Hmm. We were all really freaked.

41:27.527 --> 41:29.946
You did a wonderful job, you know.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.032
The kids were...

41:33.116 --> 41:36.119
...really impressed
with their mother today.

41:36.202 --> 41:38.204
It's not me. It's the presidency.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.164
If the skirt fits.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.459
You want to know the truth?

41:45.294 --> 41:46.963
It was a rush.

41:48.131 --> 41:51.843
Being the most
powerful person on Earth...

41:51.926 --> 41:53.594
...is a hell of a rush.

41:56.806 --> 41:59.142
I'm happy to see
you're enjoying your job, dear.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.894
But you might not want to mention

42:01.978 --> 42:07.066
the "most powerful person on Earth"
part to your husband.

42:07.150 --> 42:10.695
- You're probably right about that.
- [laughing]

42:10.778 --> 42:13.906
- All right. What do we got here?
- Chocolate chip.

42:13.990 --> 42:18.244
These are the plain.
I made some nut, but...

42:18.327 --> 42:20.955
What you've made is too many cookies.

42:21.039 --> 42:24.709
I know. I get carried away.
