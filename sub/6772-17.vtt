00:01.260 --> 00:02.070
Where'd I put that?

00:02.700 --> 00:03.860
Ohh, I thought I already...

00:04.689 --> 00:06.000
Ohh, and I can't forget I've got to--

00:07.280 --> 00:09.100
Oh, how am I ever gonna get this done?

00:09.680 --> 00:11.060
Are you sure I can't help?

00:11.500 --> 00:12.440
I could--
- No!

00:12.800 --> 00:13.980
Maybe just a--
- No thanks!

00:14.560 --> 00:16.239
How about--
- Just stand over there.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.500
But--
- Where you'll be out of the way.

00:20.540 --> 00:22.970
Ribbon, Ribbon!
Where's the ribbon?!

00:23.560 --> 00:24.320
- I got it!

00:48.920 --> 00:49.600
Um...

00:49.980 --> 00:52.980
I-I'll just go and stand over there,
where I'll be...

00:53.250 --> 00:54.480
...out of the way.

00:58.370 --> 01:01.460
<i>My Little Pony, My Little Pony...
Aaaaah...</i>

01:03.810 --> 01:08.460
<i>My Little Pony,
I used to wonder what friendship could be.</i>

01:08.770 --> 01:12.520
<i>My Little Pony,
until you all shared its magic with me.</i>

01:12.790 --> 01:16.240
<i>Big adventure. Tons of fun.
A beautiful heart, faithful and strong.</i>

01:16.540 --> 01:20.840
<i>Sharing kindness, it's an easy feat,
and magic makes it all complete!</i>

01:21.070 --> 01:26.930
<i>My Little Pony,
Do you know you are my very best friends?</i>

01:36.190 --> 01:38.430
Won't you at least let me help you clean up?

01:39.040 --> 01:41.300
No. You've helped me quite enough.

01:41.700 --> 01:42.900
I'm sorry, sis!

01:43.120 --> 01:48.480
I just thought that if I could help, I might find my special gift
and finally earn my cutie mark.

01:50.920 --> 01:54.960
I understand. It's just that...
I need this time to fill this order without any...

01:54.960 --> 01:57.170
...complications.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.830
Okay, all done.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.120
Now, back to work.

02:02.120 --> 02:05.200
I've lost a lot of time,
and I cannot have any more interruptions.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.000
What now?!

02:08.270 --> 02:11.200
- Oh, sorry. I thought the "open" sign
meant you were open,

02:11.200 --> 02:13.260
but I must have been mistaken.

02:13.510 --> 02:14.920
Fluttershy! Forgive me!

02:14.920 --> 02:19.610
was so wrapped up in my work that I forgot you were
bringing Opalescence back from her grooming!

02:19.880 --> 02:22.050
No worries, Rarity.
I've left her there in the basket.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.720
Oh, she looks great!

02:25.720 --> 02:28.270
I just don't understand how you're able to do it!

02:28.520 --> 02:31.390
I can't get near her without
getting a swipe from her claws.

02:33.230 --> 02:34.280
Ahh! Did you use...

02:35.040 --> 02:36.760
The Stare on her?

02:37.170 --> 02:39.630
Oh, no! I wouldn't! I couldn't!

02:39.940 --> 02:43.420
I-I don't really have any control over when that happens.
I-It just happens. 

02:44.110 --> 02:47.340
No, I'm just good with animals.
It's my special gift, you know?

02:47.680 --> 02:51.430
Well, you should have a picture of Opal
as a cutie mark instead of those butterflies.

02:53.210 --> 02:55.560
Maybe I can be good with animals, too!

02:59.150 --> 03:00.060
Or not.

03:02.420 --> 03:04.990
I'm sorry I can't invite you
 to stay and chat, Fluttershy.

03:04.990 --> 03:07.620
I've bitten off a bit more
than I can chew with this order.

03:07.870 --> 03:09.270
- But you're not eating anything.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.450
- No, Sweetie,

03:10.450 --> 03:11.690
it's an expression.

03:11.690 --> 03:14.180
It means that I've taken on
more work than I can handle.

03:14.390 --> 03:16.710
I've got twenty of these
special robes to make tonight!

03:16.710 --> 03:19.250
They're due in Trottingham
 tomorrow morning.

03:23.300 --> 03:25.760
See? I've lined them in a special gold silk.

03:26.020 --> 03:29.740
It took so long to make, but I think it
adds just the right touch, don't you?

03:30.330 --> 03:31.390
These are lovely,

03:31.390 --> 03:34.830
but twenty by tonight?
How will you get it all done?

03:35.280 --> 03:36.270
Well, I, uh...

03:37.330 --> 03:38.450
Maybe I could... just...

03:38.770 --> 03:42.230
...just stand over here and watch.

03:42.850 --> 03:43.660
- I'll manage.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.840
Well, maybe I should get out of
your mane so you can work.

03:47.190 --> 03:48.240
Hi, Fluttershy!

03:48.470 --> 03:49.190
Hi, Rarity!

03:50.140 --> 03:51.600
Hello, uh, girls...

03:52.090 --> 03:53.070
Hey, Sweetie Belle!

03:53.350 --> 03:54.980
Scootaloo! Apple Bloom!

03:55.260 --> 03:56.400
You ready for tonight?

03:56.400 --> 03:59.130
Yup! Cutie mark planning session is a go!

03:59.470 --> 04:02.260
Tonight is the night we each try
to find our own special talent.

04:02.260 --> 04:04.070
Even if it takes us all night!

04:04.410 --> 04:05.660
I'm ready!
You ready?

04:05.660 --> 04:06.850
Very ready!

04:07.140 --> 04:09.790
Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover at Rarity's!

04:09.790 --> 04:10.850
Yay!

04:10.850 --> 04:12.850
And... look what I made us!

04:16.399 --> 04:17.820
- That's so cool!

04:18.180 --> 04:19.870
What does that patch on your cape mean?

04:20.180 --> 04:23.200
The Cutie Mark Crusaders! Yay!

04:23.620 --> 04:25.230
We're on a crusade, a mission!

04:25.430 --> 04:26.910
To find our cutie marks!

04:27.520 --> 04:30.650
Yup. And look.
I lined them with this special gold silk.

04:30.990 --> 04:35.840
It took sooo long to make,
but I think it adds just the right touch, don't you?

04:40.120 --> 04:42.270
Sweetie Belle!
What have you DONE?

04:42.740 --> 04:44.640
That was the last of the gold silk!

04:44.640 --> 04:46.180
Oh, now I'll have to make more!

04:46.550 --> 04:48.040
Oh, I hope I can make more.

04:48.430 --> 04:49.890
I'm gonna have to work all night!

04:50.430 --> 04:51.320
Which means...

04:51.820 --> 04:55.230
Sorry, girls, I'm afraid the Crusader
sleepover is cancelled.

04:55.570 --> 04:56.450
WHAT?

04:56.450 --> 05:00.040
I just won't have any time to watch you if
I want to get these robes delivered on time.

05:00.350 --> 05:00.980
But--

05:00.980 --> 05:02.590
No buts this time.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.320
I'm sorry, Sweetie Belle;
it's just the way it has to be.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.240
I, ah, I suppose I could
take them for the night.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.710
I couldn't ask you to do that.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.560
Oh, it's no problem at all.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.740
Have you met my sister and her friends?

05:18.740 --> 05:20.590
A problem is all it would be.

05:20.590 --> 05:22.660
Did I have a problem with Opal?

05:22.890 --> 05:25.080
You've seen how well I handle small creatures!

05:25.640 --> 05:28.110
I suppose that's true...
and I do have a lot of work to do...

05:28.770 --> 05:29.860
Come on, it'll be fun.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.450
I assure you, they're quite a handful.

05:31.690 --> 05:33.230
These sweet little angels?

05:35.340 --> 05:36.280
Well...

05:37.690 --> 05:38.590
All right.

05:38.590 --> 05:41.990
Cutie Mark Crusader sleepover
at Fluttershy's cottage!

05:42.430 --> 05:43.380
Yay!

05:43.780 --> 05:44.940
So cute.

05:45.320 --> 05:46.640
W-wait for me!

05:52.500 --> 05:54.880
Oh, won't this be ever so fun?

05:54.880 --> 05:56.840
We can have a nice little tea party,

05:56.840 --> 05:58.670
and braid each other's tails,

05:58.670 --> 06:02.550
and sit quietly and color,
and tell each other fairy tales, and--

06:09.660 --> 06:10.660
Hello, Fluttershy.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.690
Oh! Hello, Twilight.
Where are you off to?

06:14.020 --> 06:17.630
I'm heading to the Everfree Forest, to Zecora's,
to get some of my favorite tea.

06:18.100 --> 06:19.940
Th-the Everfree Forest?

06:20.290 --> 06:22.510
Ah, you'll be careful, won't you?

06:22.910 --> 06:25.620
Of course! How about you?
What are you doing with the girls?

06:26.350 --> 06:31.430
Rarity has a big order to fill tonight, so I volunteered
to take the girls over to my cottage for a sleepover.

06:31.930 --> 06:34.880
Wow. Sounds like everypony
has their hooves full today.

06:35.210 --> 06:38.100
Taking care of those three fillies all by yourself?

06:38.380 --> 06:39.630
 You sure you can handle it?

06:39.880 --> 06:42.850
What? These sweet little angels?

06:43.350 --> 06:45.140
They'll be no problem at all.

06:51.780 --> 06:52.880
Wow! Look at this place!

06:52.880 --> 06:55.170
What's that?
Are those tickets?

06:57.700 --> 06:59.670
No problem at all.

07:00.210 --> 07:01.980
Okay, girls, uh, what should we do?

07:02.210 --> 07:03.600
I'm gonna get my mark first!

07:03.840 --> 07:04.440
Girls?

07:04.440 --> 07:05.770
Nuh-uh!
- I am!

07:06.810 --> 07:08.700
Girls, okay, now settle --

07:08.920 --> 07:09.980
- I'm staying up all night!

07:09.980 --> 07:11.340
- Me too!
- Me three!

07:12.480 --> 07:14.000
I-I know you're excited, but--

07:14.650 --> 07:15.470
girls,

07:16.170 --> 07:17.340
oh, oh, careful with the--

07:18.840 --> 07:19.550
oh, ah, girls--

07:22.740 --> 07:25.650
So! What do you wanna do?
Play a game?

07:26.330 --> 07:27.810
We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

07:28.220 --> 07:30.530
- And we want to crusade for our cutie marks!

07:30.890 --> 07:33.080
And, and, and, we, um--

07:33.550 --> 07:34.890
Yeah! What they said!

07:35.940 --> 07:36.830
Mmm, I don't know...

07:36.830 --> 07:39.720
How about a nice quiet little tea party?

07:40.450 --> 07:43.760
Or... we could go adventuring
in the Everfree Forest!

07:44.070 --> 07:45.080
Yeah!

07:46.380 --> 07:49.820
Oh, no. The Everfree Forest is much too dangerous.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.520
It's filled with far too many strange creatures.

07:53.130 --> 07:55.540
But you could go with us and
we could catch those creatures.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.600
We could be, umm...

07:57.930 --> 07:59.280
...creature catchers!

07:59.620 --> 08:03.250
YAY! Cutie Mark Crusader creature catchers!

08:07.760 --> 08:10.600
Arrrr... I am a dangerous creature
from the Everfree Forest! Rrrarr!

08:14.880 --> 08:16.970
Halt, dangerous creature from the Everfree Forest.

08:17.220 --> 08:20.680
I am Sweetie Belle, the creature catcher,
and I'm here to catch you!

08:21.120 --> 08:25.530
You can never catch me!
I am far too powerful and dangerous!

08:26.250 --> 08:27.860
You cannot run from me!

08:33.809 --> 08:35.409
Um, oh, maybe that's not such a--

08:36.159 --> 08:37.059
Now, girls...

08:37.059 --> 08:39.030
How about we do some nice colouring? Dhh--

08:39.440 --> 08:43.070
Come back, dangerous creature,
so I can catch you!

08:43.720 --> 08:44.670
Never!

08:45.200 --> 08:46.690
Careful... you don't...

08:48.510 --> 08:49.620
...break anything.

08:51.980 --> 08:53.400
Sorry, Fluttershy.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.060
Yeah, sorry.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.600
I guess we aren't creature catchers.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.100
Oh, girls, it's okay. I--

09:00.100 --> 09:03.040
I know! We could be
Cutie Mark Crusader carpenters!

09:03.610 --> 09:04.550
C-carpenters?

09:09.110 --> 09:09.490
Hammer!

09:09.780 --> 09:10.340
- Hammer.

09:12.530 --> 09:13.030
- Hammer!

09:13.030 --> 09:13.960
- Hammer.

09:16.140 --> 09:16.770
Hammer!

09:17.950 --> 09:18.400
Hammer.

09:28.750 --> 09:30.480
Um ... that doesn't look like a table.

09:30.690 --> 09:32.090
We were making a table?

09:32.470 --> 09:34.850
Somepony needs to put
this thing out of its misery.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.790
We are definitely not Cutie Mark Carpenters.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.520
Who wants a picture of a hammer
on their flank anyway?

09:41.630 --> 09:43.660
Well, now that we've gotten
that out of the way,

09:43.880 --> 09:44.990
how about a game?

09:45.420 --> 09:46.270
A game?

09:47.070 --> 09:48.640
It's called "Shhh!".

09:49.120 --> 09:50.150
What's that?

09:50.460 --> 09:53.430
Well, it's a game about who
can be quiet the longest.

09:53.430 --> 09:54.530
Sound fun?

09:56.390 --> 09:58.960
I'm the world champ, you know.
I bet you can't beat me!

10:03.830 --> 10:05.380
I lose! - Me too!
- Me three!

10:07.640 --> 10:08.950
Okay, now what can we do?

10:09.580 --> 10:12.610
Oooh! How about Cutie Mark Crusader coal miners?

10:12.610 --> 10:13.440
YEAH!

10:13.990 --> 10:14.570
NO!

10:16.730 --> 10:18.910
I mean, it's time for bed,
don't you think?

10:19.330 --> 10:23.420
Aren't you excited to get all toasty and warm
in your snuggly-wuggly widdle beds?

10:24.350 --> 10:25.810
Snuggly-wuggly?

10:26.040 --> 10:27.650
But we have more crusading to do!

10:28.150 --> 10:29.180
We've got plans!

10:29.980 --> 10:30.840
And capes!

10:31.560 --> 10:34.910
Um, okay, um. Maybe the crusading
can wait until morning?

10:35.130 --> 10:37.830
When it's light? 
And not so... dark?

10:38.710 --> 10:41.230
How are we gonna find
our special talent in our sleep?

10:42.520 --> 10:45.750
Maybe you'll have a lovely little dream
about your special talent.

10:46.220 --> 10:47.420
But we're not even tired!

10:49.320 --> 10:50.880
How about I sing you a lullaby?

10:51.100 --> 10:52.280
Mm-hmm, yeah!

10:53.560 --> 10:58.210
<i>Hush now, quiet now.
It's time to lay your sleepy head.</i>

10:58.410 --> 11:02.810
<i>Hush now, quiet now.
It's time to go to bed.</i>

11:04.670 --> 11:05.760
I know this one!

11:06.510 --> 11:09.630
Oh, how wonderful!
Why don't you sing it with me?

11:13.700 --> 11:17.320
<i>Hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to lay your sleepy head!</i>

11:17.320 --> 11:20.740
<i>Said hush now! Quiet now!
It's time to go to bed!</i>

11:20.740 --> 11:22.580
- Okay, Sweetie, that was... 

11:22.580 --> 11:26.150
<i>- Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep!
The exciting day behind you!</i>

11:26.150 --> 11:29.990
<i>Driftin' (driftin') off to sleep!
Let the joy of dreamland find you!</i>

11:29.990 --> 11:31.390
Thank you, Sweetie, um...

11:31.390 --> 11:34.890
<i>- Hush now! Quiet now!
Lay your sleepy head!</i>

11:34.890 --> 11:40.800
<i>Said hush now! Quiet now!
This's time to go to bed!</i>

11:44.260 --> 11:45.200
What is that?

11:51.640 --> 11:52.590
Girls!

11:53.250 --> 11:55.190
Fluttershy, your chickens are on the loose!

11:56.020 --> 11:58.700
I wonder what could
have caused that...

12:00.920 --> 12:03.860
Don't worry, Fluttershy,
the Cutie Mark Crusaders will handle this!

12:04.320 --> 12:06.440
Cutie Mark Crusader chicken herders!

12:06.440 --> 12:07.390
Yay!

12:07.610 --> 12:10.000
No, I don't think that's a-- ah, come back!

12:10.660 --> 12:11.160
Please!

12:12.690 --> 12:14.280
Come on, girls, the chickens are fine--

12:14.930 --> 12:15.210
oh, girls, um...

12:17.940 --> 12:18.770
GIRLS!

12:25.220 --> 12:26.020
Come on.

12:27.230 --> 12:28.130
In you go.

12:41.820 --> 12:43.320
There's some good chickens.

12:43.730 --> 12:47.210
Okay, you three. Isn't it about
time you got into bed?

12:47.520 --> 12:48.370
- BUT--

12:48.710 --> 12:49.620
Please?

12:53.020 --> 12:55.520
So, no more crusading for tonight,
all right?

12:56.100 --> 12:58.300
Yes, Fluttershy!
- We promise, Fluttershy!

12:58.610 --> 12:59.590
- Good night, Fluttershy!

13:00.090 --> 13:01.700
Okay, good night.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.570
Okay, so what kind of
crusading do we do next?

13:07.860 --> 13:09.670
- There's not much we
can do from this room...

13:09.970 --> 13:13.080
unless we become Cutie Mark
Crusader cottage cleaners.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.150
- N-no, thanks.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.770
Well, we have to think of something.

13:17.770 --> 13:21.570
We can't just waste this opportunity
to find out what our special talents are. 

13:22.200 --> 13:23.240
Hey, girls!

13:23.680 --> 13:24.300
Look!

13:25.390 --> 13:26.800
Some of the chickens may have escaped!

13:27.920 --> 13:29.000
Into the forest!

13:30.670 --> 13:33.100
Cutie Mark Crusaders chicken rescuers are go!

13:36.960 --> 13:38.870
It really wasn't THAT hard...

13:39.560 --> 13:42.520
I mean, all I needed to do was
just show them who's in charge. 

13:42.850 --> 13:44.660
Nothing's gonna get past Fluttershy!

13:45.170 --> 13:47.330
Good with animals,
good with kids. 

13:53.520 --> 13:54.380
Wait up!

13:57.250 --> 13:58.560
Mmm, peace and quiet.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.000
Too quiet.

14:05.870 --> 14:06.430
Girls?

14:08.870 --> 14:09.290
Girls?

14:10.650 --> 14:12.490
Elizabeak! She's missing!

14:12.870 --> 14:13.630
GIRLS?

14:14.440 --> 14:15.130
Oh, no!

14:16.100 --> 14:18.160
They must have gone looking for
my missing chicken!

14:18.460 --> 14:20.720
Which means...
they must have gone into...

14:22.840 --> 14:25.070
The Everfree Forest!

14:27.330 --> 14:29.170
Those girls have really done it this time!

14:29.430 --> 14:31.880
They've really bitten off
more than they can chew!

14:33.310 --> 14:36.580
Oh, just like me!
I never should have offered to watch them.

14:46.890 --> 14:48.360
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!

14:50.370 --> 14:51.370
What are you doing?

14:52.030 --> 14:53.120
Calling for the chicken!

14:53.730 --> 14:55.550
That is not how you call a chicken.

14:56.130 --> 14:58.060
Oh, and you know how to call a chicken?

14:58.500 --> 14:59.920
I know that's not the way.

15:00.940 --> 15:01.940
Then show me.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.610
I don't have to show you!

15:04.130 --> 15:05.670
You're just chicken!

15:06.180 --> 15:07.180
Am not!

15:07.510 --> 15:10.000
Oh, wait, now I know
how to call a chicken!

15:10.480 --> 15:13.590
Scootaloo!
Scoot-scootalooooo!

15:14.160 --> 15:16.170
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.

15:18.290 --> 15:20.130
You also forgot how
to call a chicken.

15:20.510 --> 15:21.570
Why, you...

15:22.200 --> 15:26.860
Come on, guys, we're not gonna find
the chicken or our cutie marks by arguing.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.100
Maybe that's our special talent. Arguing!

15:31.380 --> 15:32.180
Is not!

15:32.180 --> 15:33.170
Is too!

15:33.170 --> 15:35.020
- Is not!
- Is too!

15:35.020 --> 15:36.240
Anything yet?

15:36.460 --> 15:37.400
Nope.

15:38.030 --> 15:38.620
- Darn.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.250
Heeeere, chick-chick-chick-chick!

15:47.180 --> 15:49.730
Girls?
Girls?

15:52.770 --> 15:54.420
Oh! Get a hold of yourself, Fluttershy.

15:55.470 --> 15:57.330
 Just put one hoof in front of the other.

15:58.620 --> 15:59.400
Ahh! What was that?

16:05.610 --> 16:07.750
Twilight?
I-is that you?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.630
Oh, Twilight, it is you.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.470
Thank goodness you're here.

16:13.470 --> 16:16.530
I need your help. The girls are out here
somewhere, and I'm afraid that they're--

16:20.330 --> 16:21.410
Oh! What's happened to you?

16:24.120 --> 16:26.630
Oh, no! If you've been
turned to stone, it must mean--

16:27.340 --> 16:29.280
Oh! oh, no, the girls!

16:30.210 --> 16:31.930
Don't move;
I'll be back for you.

16:32.270 --> 16:32.970
GIRLS! 

16:34.150 --> 16:35.460
- It's not!
- It's too!

16:35.740 --> 16:37.370
- It's not!
- It's too!

16:37.610 --> 16:40.600
Girls! Our special talent is not arguing.

16:41.160 --> 16:46.180
Besides, what would the cutie mark of somepony
whose talent is arguing even look like?

16:46.180 --> 16:47.310
Girls?

16:47.310 --> 16:47.990
 Girls?!

16:48.460 --> 16:49.320
- Fluttershy?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.260
Girls? Thank goodness I found you!

16:52.730 --> 16:54.090
- Fluttershy, what--

16:54.090 --> 16:56.160
- Girls, we have to leave the forest at once!

16:56.540 --> 16:58.340
- But... we haven't found the chicken yet!

16:58.600 --> 17:01.250
- There's no time for that.
There's a cockatrice on the loose!

17:01.560 --> 17:02.660
A cocka what now?

17:03.540 --> 17:04.390
A cockatrice!

17:04.650 --> 17:06.970
It's a frightening creature with
the head of a chicken and the body of a snake.

17:07.190 --> 17:08.060
Now, come on!

17:08.780 --> 17:10.940
The head of a chicken
and the body of a snake?

17:10.940 --> 17:13.140
That doesn't sound scary,
that sounds silly!

17:13.690 --> 17:18.300
Well, if I ever saw one of them cockathingies
face-to-face, I'd laugh at how silly it was.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.150
NO! Never look one in the eye.

17:21.990 --> 17:23.329
If you look a cockatrice in the eye--

17:23.329 --> 17:24.390
- The chicken!

17:24.720 --> 17:25.750
Girls! Wait!

17:25.750 --> 17:27.140
Here, chick-chick-chick-chick-chick!

17:33.570 --> 17:34.290
There it is!

17:36.220 --> 17:37.140
Two chickens?

17:37.910 --> 17:39.340
I thought only one escaped!

17:39.820 --> 17:40.660
Grab them both!

18:12.200 --> 18:13.630
See? Now we have to --

18:16.520 --> 18:16.910
Girls.

18:17.200 --> 18:17.700
Please.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.650
Girls-- now listen to me.

18:20.010 --> 18:20.770
I-- please!

18:25.940 --> 18:26.690
Girls!

18:27.830 --> 18:29.280
GIRLS! Behind me, NOW!

18:37.380 --> 18:38.020
YOU!

18:38.600 --> 18:42.240
Just who do you think you are,
going around turning others into stone?

18:45.240 --> 18:46.780
You should be ashamed of yourself.

18:47.080 --> 18:50.960
I have a mind to find your mother and
tell her what you've been up to, young man.

18:54.470 --> 18:58.620
Now you go over there, and turn Elizabeak
and my friend Twilight back to normal, 

18:59.570 --> 19:02.020
and don't ever let me catch you doing this again.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.380
Do you understand me?

19:10.840 --> 19:13.220
Are you girls all right? I was so worried!

19:13.550 --> 19:14.600
Yeah, fine!

19:15.130 --> 19:16.580
Thanks to that stare of yours.

19:17.050 --> 19:19.170
You're like the queen of stares. You're the--

19:19.390 --> 19:21.510
Stare Master!

19:22.190 --> 19:24.780
We're sorry we snuck out
of the house and into the forest.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.640
Yeah. We'll listen to you
from now on.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.040
We promise.

19:29.590 --> 19:33.140
Oh, you DO, do you?
Well, you better, or I'll give you...

19:33.370 --> 19:34.460
...The Stare.

19:43.250 --> 19:43.810
What...

19:45.320 --> 19:46.250
What happened?

19:52.830 --> 19:54.750
And that's when it brought you back from stone.

19:55.620 --> 19:58.070
This is gonna make quite
a letter to the princess.

19:58.350 --> 19:59.800
I was wrong about you.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.050
You certainly do know
how to handle those girls.

20:03.070 --> 20:04.080
Oh, I wouldn't go that far.

20:05.040 --> 20:05.800
Hmm? How so?

20:06.380 --> 20:09.230
I assumed that I'd be just as
good with kids as I am with animals.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.070
Boy, was I wrong.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.780
I really learned the hard way not to
bite off more than I could chew.

20:15.120 --> 20:16.270
You and Rarity both.

20:17.060 --> 20:17.940
Good morning, Rarity.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.200
Did you finish all those capes?

20:20.530 --> 20:22.040
Just delivered them.

20:22.730 --> 20:23.530
I have to admit,

20:23.780 --> 20:26.150
 if you hadn't come along,
I might not have.

20:26.550 --> 20:27.580
Thanks again.

20:28.620 --> 20:29.940
Won't you stay for some tea?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.520
I really must get back to the shop and clean up.

20:32.820 --> 20:34.800
Girls! Get your things.
Time to go.

20:36.380 --> 20:36.770
Girls!

20:37.810 --> 20:38.090
Girls!

20:38.690 --> 20:39.140
Time to--

20:40.480 --> 20:40.850
Girls!

20:41.460 --> 20:42.130
Your things!

20:42.910 --> 20:43.500
Girls!

20:44.730 --> 20:45.530
It's time to--

20:46.890 --> 20:47.690
GIRLS!

20:48.280 --> 20:48.840
Allow me.

20:50.330 --> 20:50.680
Girls?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.160
Yes, Fluttershy.
- You called?

20:55.850 --> 20:58.310
Go and get your things.
Rarity is here to see you home.

20:58.980 --> 21:00.710
Of course, Fluttershy, right away!

21:02.010 --> 21:04.650
Ah, huh, ah, how did you... how did you do that?

21:06.980 --> 21:09.620
I guess I'm just as good
with kids as I am with animals.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.790
Thank you, Fluttershy! Bye! Thank you Stare Master!

21:14.840 --> 21:18.000
Ah, uh, speaking of which,
I could use your help with Opal.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.170
Of course. How about later today?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.200
How about now?
