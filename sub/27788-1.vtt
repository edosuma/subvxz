WOMAN:
I swear she's older than my mom.

00:58.852 --> 01:00.979
Fucking kill me if I'm
still doing this at her age.

01:03.481 --> 01:06.359
Kill you now
if you ask me nicely.

01:08.486 --> 01:10.256
You know we're not allowed
to eat or drink in here.

01:10.280 --> 01:11.280
Yeah.

01:11.364 --> 01:13.491
Oh, fuck off.

01:13.575 --> 01:15.243
MAN: What did you say?

01:15.326 --> 01:18.121
Uh, I believe I said,
"Oh, fuck off."

01:19.456 --> 01:20.582
MAN: Pack up.

01:23.668 --> 01:25.128
I'm almost finished

01:25.211 --> 01:26.963

- Now.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.083
WOMAN: Oh, thank you.

04:13.087 --> 04:15.673
TOM CLANCY:
But then there was nobody left,

04:15.757 --> 04:19.260
and I was standing by myself.

04:19.344 --> 04:21.529
WOMAN 2: And how long until
your next book will come out?

04:21.553 --> 04:23.681
TOM: Good question. Uh...

04:23.765 --> 04:25.683
Well, this is a surprise.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.769
You invited me, did you not?

04:27.852 --> 04:29.604
You didn't reply.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.230
Coat check?

04:31.314 --> 04:33.691
At my party, we just threw
the coats on the bed.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.235
Good to see you, too, Lee.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.738
You never called me back,
and I...

04:38.821 --> 04:40.698
I have new ideas.

04:40.782 --> 04:42.200
Is this why you came?

04:43.242 --> 04:45.578
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm glad you're here.

04:45.662 --> 04:46.788
Try to have a good time.

04:46.955 --> 04:50.416
TOM: I like interviews.
Don't get me wrong.

04:50.500 --> 04:54.796
I just wish that you could
get it all done at once.

04:54.879 --> 04:56.714
(Woman 2 laughing)

05:04.847 --> 05:06.033
WOMAN 3:
Did you read it? It was...

05:06.057 --> 05:07.767
TOM: I haven't missed
a day of writing

05:07.850 --> 05:10.311
for the past 25 years.

05:10.395 --> 05:12.313
WOMAN 2: And do you ever
have trouble beginning?

05:12.397 --> 05:15.692
I don't subscribe to
the notion of writer's block.

05:15.775 --> 05:17.485
You never experience it?

05:17.568 --> 05:18.736
Writer's block is a term

05:18.820 --> 05:20.571
invented by the
writing community

05:20.738 --> 05:22.615
- to justify their laziness.
- (women chuckle)

05:22.782 --> 05:23.842
My success
is nothing more than

05:23.866 --> 05:25.466
that I have the determination
and stamina

05:25.535 --> 05:27.328
to sit and get the work done.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.998
- It's simple.
- Jackass.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.417
KAREN:
I mean, I find his distaste

05:32.500 --> 05:35.336
for linear plot structure
downright macabre.

05:37.088 --> 05:38.088
(sighs)

05:58.651 --> 06:00.987
Well, that was quick.
Did you get properly fed?

06:01.070 --> 06:02.947
This week,
will you return my call?

06:03.031 --> 06:05.033
Sure. We'll see.

06:05.116 --> 06:07.577
I'm working on a lot
of fascinating projects.

06:07.660 --> 06:10.580
I just need my agent
to call me back.

06:10.663 --> 06:12.248
I don't think the world
is waiting

06:12.331 --> 06:14.709
for another Fanny Brice
biography, Lee.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.127
And we may disagree

06:16.210 --> 06:18.755
on what is considered
fascinating.

06:19.756 --> 06:20.756
Good night.

06:21.674 --> 06:24.177
Why do you have mostly-used
toilet paper rolls

06:24.260 --> 06:25.720
in the cabinet in your bathroom?

06:27.263 --> 06:29.724
So that the guests
can have a full roll.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.560
Well, that's batshit, Marjorie.

06:43.488 --> 06:46.491
I lost my ticket,
but that's my coat over there.

06:46.574 --> 06:48.367
There on the end.

06:53.122 --> 06:55.249
Have a good night, ma'am.

07:11.474 --> 07:12.642
(door closes)

07:19.398 --> 07:21.317
WOMAN (on TV):
<i>You'll be a very rich man.</i>

07:21.400 --> 07:23.111
<i>(indistinct chatter on TV)</i>

07:33.121 --> 07:34.640
REGINA: <i>We'll talk about
it in a few years.</i>

07:34.664 --> 07:36.999
OSCAR:
<i>I want to talk about it now!</i>

07:37.083 --> 07:38.560
LEE (as Regina): There are lots
of things to consider.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.002
After all,
they are first cousins.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.688
(as Oscar)
Well, that's not unusual,

07:41.712 --> 07:43.607
our grandmother and grandfather
were first cousins.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.133
(as Regina)
Yes, and look at us.

07:45.216 --> 07:46.384
(Lee and Regina laugh)

07:48.219 --> 07:49.220
(laughs)

07:51.973 --> 07:53.724
Here, Jersey girl.

07:53.808 --> 07:56.811
I brought your favorite.
I brought you shrimpy.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.604
Hmm? Come on.
It's your favorite.

08:01.774 --> 08:06.487
REGINA: <i>Very well. I assure you,
Oscar, I will think about it...</i>

08:08.739 --> 08:10.867
(dogs barking)

08:12.660 --> 08:15.580
So, you still have a balance,
Miss Israel.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.665
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

08:17.748 --> 08:21.544
But she's really sick
and she's very old.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.212
I'm sorry,
but the doctor told me that

08:23.296 --> 08:24.731
I need to have at least
half the balance

08:24.755 --> 08:26.132
before I do any tests.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.969
Didn't you people take
a Hippocratic oath?

08:30.136 --> 08:32.513
You owe us $82.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.890
God. Wow.

08:42.732 --> 08:44.525
(Jersey sneezing)

08:44.609 --> 08:46.652
You know, if she did come
out here, she'd see this.

08:52.992 --> 08:55.411
All right, I have $14.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.788
I'm sorry, but I can't.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.751
No, we need half the balance.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.844
(car horn honks in distance)

09:21.270 --> 09:22.563
God...

09:22.647 --> 09:23.731
Asshole.

09:35.326 --> 09:37.453
Okay. Just these.

09:39.038 --> 09:42.250
Come on, man. I schlepped
these all the way here.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.960
I'll give you two dollars.

09:44.043 --> 09:45.962
I don't want the others.

09:46.045 --> 09:47.380
I don't even need that much.

09:47.463 --> 09:49.674
I just don't want to carry
them around anymore.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.592
I got a sick cat, and I...

09:51.676 --> 09:53.427
I told you
I don't want the others.

09:53.511 --> 09:55.221
There's people waiting.

09:55.304 --> 09:58.057
You know, you don't have
to be so disrespectful.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.601
Okay? You have actually
carried my books here.

10:01.894 --> 10:02.895
And you are?

10:03.104 --> 10:05.147
I'm Lee Israel.

10:05.231 --> 10:07.858
Oh, Miss Israel.
We have copies

10:07.942 --> 10:09.735
of your latest work
right over there.

10:13.406 --> 10:14.699
You're a rude little ape.

10:14.782 --> 10:15.783
Okay, get your garbage

10:15.866 --> 10:17.368
- off my counter.
- No!

10:30.089 --> 10:32.300
(door opens)

10:32.967 --> 10:34.760
- Miss Israel?
- Hi, Andrei.

10:34.969 --> 10:36.470
It's been three months.

10:36.554 --> 10:38.806
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm working on it.

10:38.889 --> 10:40.474
I don't want to call
the management.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.770
Can you just cut me
a little slack? I'm...

10:44.854 --> 10:47.648
going through a rough patch,
and I just lost my job.

10:47.732 --> 10:49.567
I think it was ageism.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.235
You've been here
longer than I have,

10:51.319 --> 10:53.696
and you've been
kind to my mother.

10:55.114 --> 10:57.533
Just get it to me soon.
I will.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.368
Absolutely. Thank you.

11:01.746 --> 11:03.664
Uh, hey, in the meantime,

11:03.748 --> 11:05.624
do you think you could send
an exterminator

11:05.708 --> 11:07.126
up to my apartment?

11:07.209 --> 11:09.545
I have an untenable
fly situation.

11:17.428 --> 11:18.763
(sighing)

11:23.768 --> 11:24.977

Good afternoon, darling.

MAN: Hey, Jack Handsome.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.078
Can I have a beer,
pretty please?

11:42.244 --> 11:43.954
I don't know. Can you?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.922
- Lee Israel?
- (loud slam)

11:53.047 --> 11:55.508
(soft music playing
on headphones)

11:55.674 --> 11:57.510
It's Jack Hock.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.929
Last time I saw you...
Thank you.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.056
We were both pleasantly pissed

12:02.139 --> 12:03.599
at some horrible book party.

12:03.682 --> 12:04.682
Am I right?

12:04.767 --> 12:07.645
It's slowly flooding back to me.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.872
BARTENDER:
Hey, what can I get you?

12:08.896 --> 12:11.273
You're friends with,
um, Julia some...

12:11.357 --> 12:12.733
- Steinberg!
- Yeah.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.152
(sighs) She's not an
agent anymore. She died.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.446
She did? Jesus, that's young.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.323
Maybe she didn't die.

12:19.407 --> 12:21.867
Maybe she just moved back
to the suburbs.

12:21.951 --> 12:23.494
I always confuse those two.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.787
No, that's right.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.622
She got married and had twins.

12:26.705 --> 12:27.915
Better to have died.

12:28.082 --> 12:29.333
Indeed.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.421
(Jack exhales)

12:35.131 --> 12:36.891
I've just come from having
my teeth bleached.

12:36.966 --> 12:38.175
How do they look?

12:38.342 --> 12:39.927
Why would you do that?

12:40.010 --> 12:41.804
Oh, teeth are a dead giveaway.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.765
Okay.
Can I buy you a drink?

12:45.266 --> 12:46.809
Even though
you're the posh writer?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.477
Thank you.
(snaps fingers) Craigy?

12:48.561 --> 12:49.562
Top her up.
CRAIG: Yeah?

12:51.605 --> 12:53.566
You know,
I keep trying to remember

12:53.649 --> 12:56.235
that party that you mentioned.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.779
And something keeps
flashing in my head.

12:58.863 --> 12:59.989
I know something happened,

13:00.072 --> 13:02.491
but I can't seem
to put my finger on it.

13:02.575 --> 13:04.118
Bad shrimp?

13:04.952 --> 13:07.580
Jack Hock, you said, huh?
CRAIG: Here you go.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.375
That's me.
The renegade, the rebel.

13:11.459 --> 13:13.335
Jack Hock, big cock.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.338
I'm sure
it'll come back to me.

13:18.591 --> 13:21.135
How's old life
been treating you?

13:21.218 --> 13:22.470
I can honestly boast

13:22.553 --> 13:24.430
that I'm banned from
Crosby Street Booksellers.

13:27.766 --> 13:30.227
I'm banned from Duane Reade.

13:30.311 --> 13:31.979
All of them.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.023
I have a little
shoplifting problem.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.775
Well, it's all in the past,
but, uh...

13:36.859 --> 13:40.779
but for some reason,
I have a very memorable mug.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.490
And now I have to take a bus

13:42.573 --> 13:46.285
just to buy shampoo
and aspirin and stuff.

13:47.953 --> 13:52.249
I'm joking. Duane Reade's
not the only rodeo in town.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.585
You pissed in a closet.

13:54.668 --> 13:58.506
- I did what?
- You pissed in a closet.

13:59.507 --> 14:00.966
Now I remember.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.259
Nobody could stop talking

14:02.343 --> 14:04.053
about the handsome
English gentleman...

14:04.136 --> 14:05.136
Why, thank you.

14:05.262 --> 14:07.431
...who was so shit-faced

14:07.515 --> 14:10.601
he mistook the coat
closet for the can.

14:11.602 --> 14:13.896
You ruined thousands
of dollars' worth of furs.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.314
Well, I...

14:15.397 --> 14:20.152
Those old biddies didn't know
what hit 'em.

14:20.236 --> 14:22.780
(both laughing)

14:22.863 --> 14:26.534
Oh, their disgusting furs
covered in piss.

14:26.617 --> 14:28.953
Dogs followed them home.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.871
(both continue laughing)

14:36.001 --> 14:38.379
I'm glad somebody
found it amusing.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.423
Some folks stopped talking
to me after that night.

14:41.507 --> 14:44.176
Well, fuck 'em.
Cheers.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.427
(Lee chuckles)

14:48.639 --> 14:50.391
So, do you work, Jack Hock?

14:50.474 --> 14:51.850
Oh, this and that.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.060
Mostly that.

14:53.978 --> 14:56.105
I happen to have
some very nice cocaine,

14:56.188 --> 14:57.273
if you're interested.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.275
No, I'm not.

14:59.358 --> 15:01.238
Oh, Jesus, it's not like
I have it all the time.

15:01.277 --> 15:03.028
Boy's gotta do
what a boy's gotta do.

15:03.112 --> 15:05.322
Anyways, (sniffles)
who are you to judge?

15:05.406 --> 15:07.166
It's four in the afternoon,
and you're drunk.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.617
I'm hardly drunk.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.286
Mmm?

15:10.369 --> 15:12.871
It's not "anyways,"
it's "anyway."

15:13.914 --> 15:16.792
Anyways, let's keep drinking.

15:16.875 --> 15:17.876
The day is young.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.588
(jazz music playing)

15:25.134 --> 15:26.135
Hey!

15:31.056 --> 15:33.225
You getting off
at the next stop?

15:34.059 --> 15:36.604
79th. And you?

15:36.687 --> 15:38.272
Yeah, I'll get out there.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.898
Works for me.

15:39.982 --> 15:41.442
(indistinct radio chatter)

15:42.568 --> 15:44.403
I think I saw you
at Zabar's once.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.113
You were shouting at someone.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.657
They have terrible
customer service.

15:48.741 --> 15:50.743
I shopped there for years.

15:52.161 --> 15:54.455
They've really great bread.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.464
Oh, it's delicious.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.216
It's really good.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.885
So good.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.637
(dog barks)

16:09.720 --> 16:12.222
Oh, my.
That's the guy.

16:12.306 --> 16:13.307
JACK: Who?

16:13.599 --> 16:15.851
That's the asshole
from Crosby Street Bookseller.

16:15.934 --> 16:17.353
No.

16:17.519 --> 16:20.522
- What are the odds of that?
- Oh, I love the way you smell.

16:20.606 --> 16:21.732
(dog barking)

16:22.733 --> 16:24.860
Pen and paper.
Quick, quick, quick.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.028
Why?

16:28.489 --> 16:31.283
Come on.
I've got... Hang on. I...

16:44.838 --> 16:46.256
(dog barking)

16:48.175 --> 16:50.302
- Got it!
- LEE: Shh!

16:55.391 --> 16:56.558
(dog barks)

16:58.352 --> 17:00.270
This is me.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.563
Nice place.

17:01.647 --> 17:05.275
Used to be a lot nicer.
How about you?

17:05.358 --> 17:06.984
Couple of blocks along.

17:09.655 --> 17:10.781
Well...

17:12.574 --> 17:15.327
Jack, this was not unpleasant.

17:15.411 --> 17:17.037
See you tomorrow?

17:17.663 --> 17:18.872
You shall.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.624
(door opens)

18:38.744 --> 18:40.496
ANNA (reading):
<i>"Lee, today was to have been</i>

18:40.579 --> 18:42.247
<i>"the</i> Esquire <i>shoot with Spence.</i>

18:42.331 --> 18:44.500
"Difficult days, these.

18:44.583 --> 18:47.795
"Thank you for your sympathy
and understanding.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.797
"Ever yours, Kate.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.801
"P.S. Forgive the splotches.
All tears lately."

18:53.884 --> 18:57.054
(clicks tongue)
What a lovely apology.

18:58.764 --> 19:01.767
This is very special.
Why would you part with it?

19:02.476 --> 19:03.685
Clutter.

19:03.769 --> 19:05.938
You know, I'm not
a very sentimental gal.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.856
Handwritten even.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.525
You're the Lee Israel?

19:09.608 --> 19:11.652
Jesus, is there another one?

19:11.735 --> 19:14.154
I've read your biographies.

19:14.238 --> 19:16.365
- Have you?
- You're a wonderful writer.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.200
Thank you.

19:18.283 --> 19:20.702
You might want
to remind my publisher.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.871
Well, her letters usually have

19:22.955 --> 19:24.373
the intimacy of a phone book,

19:24.456 --> 19:27.084
but this one is really nice.

19:27.251 --> 19:29.920
How does $175 sound?

19:30.003 --> 19:31.839
Sounds terrific.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.091
(indistinct chatter)

19:35.300 --> 19:36.760
(cash register dings)

19:41.265 --> 19:44.059
I rang you.
You didn't ring me back.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.561
Should I take it personally?

19:45.686 --> 19:46.728
Well, why wouldn't you?

19:46.812 --> 19:48.132
(scoffs)
I'd never get out of bed.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.357
Then luckily for me, you did.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.109
I'm coming over to join you.

19:52.276 --> 19:55.445
I'm not good at reading
social cues.

19:56.697 --> 19:58.365
Uh, scotch and soda, Craig,

19:58.532 --> 20:01.076
- and I'll buy his next one.
- You got it.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.703
JACK:
Mmm, things are looking up.

20:02.786 --> 20:04.621
Aren't you writing a new book?

20:04.705 --> 20:05.706
About Fanny Brice.

20:05.873 --> 20:06.915
Who?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.376
Fanny Brice.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.753
Just the greatest vaudeville
comedian of her time.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.382
You sure you're a fag?

20:15.549 --> 20:17.426
Mm-hmm.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.223
(jazz music playing)

21:20.489 --> 21:22.032
(woman coughing)

21:32.584 --> 21:34.294
Hmm.

21:44.596 --> 21:47.849
Just recently found out
that my cousin, Sidney,

21:48.058 --> 21:51.395
was in possession of this
delightful bonne bouche.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.731
And I just thought that
you might be interested in it.

21:54.815 --> 21:58.026
Fanny Brice.
One of my favorites.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.945
I'm writing a new
biography about her.

22:00.028 --> 22:01.738
Well, what a funny
coincidence then,

22:01.822 --> 22:03.198
that your cousin had this.

22:05.659 --> 22:08.620
Didn't she say, "Wrong is for
other people"? I love that.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.455
She did say that.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.169
So, what do you think?

22:16.253 --> 22:17.796
I believe I can sell this.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.674
I could give you $75.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.259
Oh. Uh...

22:22.342 --> 22:24.302
I could give more
for better content.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.263
It's a bit bland is all.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.223
True.
(chuckles)

22:28.348 --> 22:30.726
Um, well, do you think
you could pay in cash?

22:30.809 --> 22:32.811
Oh. Let me see if I have enough.

22:33.812 --> 22:36.023
I'm glad to hear you're writing
another book.

22:36.106 --> 22:38.025
I'll be the first to buy it.

22:39.735 --> 22:42.029
Did you hear Tom Clancy
is getting paid

22:42.112 --> 22:43.238
three million dollars

22:43.405 --> 22:45.365
to write more right-wing
macho bullshit?

22:45.449 --> 22:46.867
Are you kidding me?

22:46.950 --> 22:49.244
That blowhard's getting
three million dollars?

22:49.327 --> 22:50.787
(scoffs)
Oh, to be a white male

22:50.871 --> 22:53.331
that doesn't even know
he's full of crap, right?

22:53.498 --> 22:57.169
I've tried to write a little.
Short stories.

22:57.252 --> 22:59.713
I know better than to presume
they're any good.

22:59.796 --> 23:02.466
Oh, I can't believe
I just admitted that.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.009
I'm sure they're terrible.

23:04.176 --> 23:05.886
They might be.

23:07.304 --> 23:09.306
Or they might not be.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.891
You know, I could take a look.

23:12.142 --> 23:13.226
Really?

23:13.310 --> 23:15.187
- I'll be honest.
- (chuckles)

23:15.270 --> 23:17.189
Unfortunately, I believe you.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.690
$75.

23:21.902 --> 23:23.671
- WOMAN: Ms. Israel!
- I hear they got Tom Clancy

23:23.695 --> 23:24.905
three million dollars

23:24.988 --> 23:27.532
to write some more
red-baiting propaganda.

23:27.616 --> 23:30.452
Lee, my morning has been
long enough already.

23:30.535 --> 23:32.204
He's a fraud.

23:32.287 --> 23:33.330
What's your point?

23:33.413 --> 23:36.083
He was drinking sherry
at your party.

23:36.166 --> 23:38.293
No self-respecting writer
would drink sherry.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.045
Oh, Lord, Lee.

23:40.295 --> 23:41.655
I need you to get me
a book advance

23:41.713 --> 23:43.548
on my Fanny Brice book.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.425
I need you to get
ten thousand dollars.

23:45.509 --> 23:48.512
I'm months behind in my rent,
and my cat is sick.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.573
And isn't this the exact reason
that I have an agent?

23:50.597 --> 23:52.933
I can't get you an advance
like that, Lee. I just can't.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.227
Give me one reason
why that cocky shit

23:55.352 --> 23:56.512
gets three million dollars...

23:56.645 --> 23:58.605
and you can't get me
ten thousand?

23:58.688 --> 23:59.898
Are you that bad of an agent?

24:00.190 --> 24:02.359
Toni, could you please
close the door?

24:02.442 --> 24:06.154
Ms. Israel and I have some
sensitive business to discuss.

24:06.321 --> 24:07.757
LEE: Yeah, God forbid
you have to hear

24:07.781 --> 24:09.991
an adult conversation, Toni!

24:10.200 --> 24:11.701
I'll give you three reasons.

24:11.785 --> 24:14.955
Number one,
Tom Clancy is famous.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.040
(scoffs)
Here we go!

24:17.124 --> 24:19.543
Yes, you have written a couple
of successful biographies

24:19.709 --> 24:20.895
and you've managed to disappear

24:20.919 --> 24:22.504
behind your subject matter,

24:22.587 --> 24:25.298
but because of that,
nobody knows who you are!

24:25.382 --> 24:27.134
Because I'm doing my job.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.300
Number two,

24:28.343 --> 24:30.137
Tom Clancy does
every radio show.

24:30.220 --> 24:33.140
He does <i>Larry King.</i>
He goes to every book signing.

24:33.223 --> 24:34.391
He plays the game.

24:34.558 --> 24:36.518
Meanwhile, you have destroyed

24:36.601 --> 24:38.520
every bridge
I have built for you.

24:38.603 --> 24:41.523
See, that is beside the point.
I am doing good writing!

24:41.690 --> 24:44.818
Number three, nobody wants
a book about Fanny Brice.

24:44.985 --> 24:49.239
There is nothing new or sexy
about Fanny Brice.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.158
I couldn't get you a $10 advance

24:51.241 --> 24:52.951
for a book about Fanny Brice.

24:55.579 --> 24:58.456
I had a book on the
<i>New York Times</i> bestseller list.

24:59.457 --> 25:02.711
That has to count for something.

25:07.174 --> 25:10.177
Lee, I have known
you a long time,

25:10.260 --> 25:13.388
and believe me,
it hurts to say this to you.

25:13.471 --> 25:15.807
Tell me what to do then,
Marjorie.

25:15.891 --> 25:17.851
I have to do something.

25:17.934 --> 25:18.935
I'll take anything.

25:19.019 --> 25:21.188
Magazine pieces,
cracker box copy.

25:21.271 --> 25:25.192
Okay. Okay.
You have two options.

25:26.651 --> 25:28.111
You either become
a nicer person,

25:28.320 --> 25:31.406
you put on a clean shirt,
you stop drinking,

25:31.489 --> 25:33.241
you say "please"
and "thank you."

25:33.325 --> 25:35.619
Oh, God. Give me
a fucking break, please.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.705
Well, clearly that's
not going to happen.

25:38.788 --> 25:41.041
Or you can take
the time to go out

25:41.124 --> 25:43.126
and make a name for yourself.

25:43.293 --> 25:45.712
And then maybe, maybe,

25:45.795 --> 25:48.840
I can get you paid
for your work again.

25:48.924 --> 25:51.801
And how is it that I'm supposed
to do that, Marjorie?

25:51.885 --> 25:53.762
I'm a 51-year-old woman

25:53.845 --> 25:56.014
who likes cats
better than people.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.476
Not exactly hot and sexy,
as you like to say.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.561
Write your book
in your own voice.

26:01.645 --> 26:04.147
Well, you've been threatening
to do it for 10 years.

26:04.314 --> 26:06.399
I'd love to, Marjorie.

26:06.483 --> 26:08.568
Except that I have bills to pay.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.528
And not everybody
has an ex-husband

26:10.612 --> 26:13.073
who left them a
Classic Six on the Park!

26:16.076 --> 26:19.079
You can be an asshole
when you're famous,

26:19.162 --> 26:20.872
but as an unknown,

26:20.956 --> 26:23.959
you can't be such a bitch, Lee.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.045
Nobody is going to pay

26:27.128 --> 26:30.799
for the writer
Lee Israel right now.

26:30.882 --> 26:33.385
My suggestion to you
is you go out there

26:33.468 --> 26:36.346
and you find another way
to make a living.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.651
(sighs)

27:18.888 --> 27:19.888
Hmm.

27:30.775 --> 27:31.985
(Lee exhales)

27:33.528 --> 27:34.654
(typing)

27:34.738 --> 27:36.031
<i>LEE: "P.S.</i>

27:37.073 --> 27:41.369
<i>"I have a new grandkid,
and he got my old nose.</i>

27:41.536 --> 27:42.996
<i>"Do I have to leave him</i>

27:43.163 --> 27:45.081
<i>"an extra something
for repairs?"</i>

27:45.165 --> 27:46.166
(typewriter bell dings)

27:57.427 --> 27:58.636
(clears throat)

27:59.137 --> 28:00.430
(chuckles)

28:03.641 --> 28:06.227
Yeah, I can definitely get
a lot more for this one.

28:06.311 --> 28:09.314
I mean, the P.S.
makes it priceless.

28:09.397 --> 28:10.732
(Anna chuckles)

28:11.566 --> 28:14.110
How does $350 sound?

28:16.905 --> 28:19.366
So, one of each, twice a day,
in her food.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.743
The infection will probably
go away in a day or two,

28:21.826 --> 28:23.328
but keep giving her the pills.

28:23.411 --> 28:24.871
It'll stabilize her.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.921
And here,
your mom needed some milk.

28:33.088 --> 28:35.006
Thank you, Miss Israel.

28:35.090 --> 28:37.801
You're welcome.
Your hair looks nice today.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.053
Oh, no, no, no.

28:40.136 --> 28:41.576
Are you still having
insect problems?

28:41.721 --> 28:44.015
Yeah, it's awful. I mean,
there's dead flies everywhere.

28:44.099 --> 28:45.308
I'm going to take care of it.

28:46.184 --> 28:47.310
Thanks.

29:01.324 --> 29:02.617
(bell jingles)

29:09.582 --> 29:10.959
(sighs)

29:29.561 --> 29:30.895
(exhales)

29:50.123 --> 29:51.499
<i>LEE: My dear Billy...</i>

29:51.583 --> 29:53.543
<i>I fear I must
decline your invitation</i>

29:53.626 --> 29:56.713
<i>as this weekend heralds
the arrival of Marlene.</i>

29:56.796 --> 29:58.673
<i>The canny old kraut remains</i>

29:58.756 --> 30:00.467
<i>one of my most cherished friends</i>

30:00.550 --> 30:02.969
<i>despite her predisposition
to whining</i>

30:03.052 --> 30:05.346
<i>ad nauseam
about her aging process</i>

30:05.430 --> 30:07.223
<i>as though she were
the first gorgeous lady</i>

30:07.307 --> 30:09.184
<i>undone by Father Time.</i>

30:09.267 --> 30:10.518
<i>Ever yours, Noël.</i>

30:37.629 --> 30:38.755
(sighs)

31:12.413 --> 31:13.413
(gasps)

31:13.456 --> 31:15.583
(sighs deeply)

31:26.636 --> 31:28.304
(mouths word)

31:36.312 --> 31:37.397
(door closes)

31:59.502 --> 32:00.502
Welcome.

32:00.962 --> 32:02.547
Good afternoon.

32:03.256 --> 32:04.340
Um...

32:04.424 --> 32:05.967
I'm aware that you sell

32:06.050 --> 32:08.720
memorabilia and first editions.

32:08.803 --> 32:11.848
Is that also for typed,
signed letters?

32:12.056 --> 32:13.474
Yes, all of that.

32:13.558 --> 32:14.976
What can I do for you?

32:19.564 --> 32:23.526
Wondering if these might be
of interest to you?

32:32.744 --> 32:34.954
(chuckles in delight)

32:39.083 --> 32:41.753
These are wonderful.
Yes, I'd be very interested.

32:45.548 --> 32:47.842
My cousin was a collector.

32:47.925 --> 32:50.386
He's asked me to help sell
some of his treasures

32:50.470 --> 32:52.472
so he can afford
the early bird specials

32:52.555 --> 32:53.640
in Palm Beach.

32:53.723 --> 32:56.476
Hard to find letters
that have a real...

32:56.559 --> 32:59.354
taste of the
author's personality,

32:59.437 --> 33:01.230
but these do just that.

33:01.314 --> 33:03.816
Yes. I thought so, too.

33:03.941 --> 33:06.611
He's a very, very clever man.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.614
I can give you $200 for them.
How does that sound?

33:11.949 --> 33:14.230
I'm afraid I can probably get
double that elsewhere, so...

33:14.369 --> 33:15.620
Okay.

33:15.703 --> 33:17.789
You're probably right.

33:17.872 --> 33:19.082
Name your price.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.920
$400 seems fair.

33:25.672 --> 33:26.673
Okay.

33:26.756 --> 33:28.091
(inhales deeply)

33:32.178 --> 33:33.179
Um...

33:33.262 --> 33:34.889
Do you happen to have cash?

33:34.972 --> 33:37.600
My cousin has closed
all of his banking accounts.

33:37.684 --> 33:38.976
It's complicated.

33:39.227 --> 33:41.229
I think I've got it.

33:45.858 --> 33:48.903
And please, if you come across
anything else, bring it in.

33:48.986 --> 33:51.823
I've got high-end clients
who come in frequently,

33:51.906 --> 33:56.119
or I'll call them if I have
something I know they'll like.

33:56.577 --> 33:57.745
Sure thing.

33:57.912 --> 34:00.081
In fact, I have a buyer
who actually knew Mr. Coward.

34:00.248 --> 34:02.166
He's gonna love these.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.876
Really?

34:04.419 --> 34:05.628
Wonderful.

34:09.465 --> 34:10.465
Okay, then.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.053
(phone ringing)

34:15.054 --> 34:16.139
Crosby Street.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.681
<i>LEE: I'm looking
for the tall guy.</i>

34:17.764 --> 34:18.683
<i>The book buyer.</i>

34:18.766 --> 34:19.766
This is he.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.393
Oh, hello, thank God!

34:21.476 --> 34:24.688
This is Lillian Schuster
from the fourth floor.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.250
(Jack laughing)
There's been an emergency.

34:26.274 --> 34:27.567
The building's on fire!

34:27.734 --> 34:29.694
Oh, God!
(stammering)

34:29.777 --> 34:32.029
Can you get in?
Can you get into the building?

34:32.112 --> 34:33.447
- My dog is in there.
<i>- No!</i>

34:33.614 --> 34:36.242
There's flames coming out
of your window right now.

34:36.367 --> 34:38.369
(both laughing)

34:40.204 --> 34:41.289
That was very enjoyable.

34:41.371 --> 34:42.415
Go, go, go!

34:42.498 --> 34:43.666
You do a very good voice.

34:43.750 --> 34:45.168
Oh!

34:45.251 --> 34:47.020
LEE: You know what,
I got no jingle in my jeans.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.045
You got a token?

34:48.129 --> 34:49.630
(Jack laughing)

34:50.339 --> 34:54.092
This is a celebratory
drinking session,

34:54.177 --> 34:55.928
and not a wallowing one.

34:56.012 --> 34:58.222
It's hard to tell the
difference with you.

34:58.306 --> 34:59.432
No offense.
(chuckling)

35:01.017 --> 35:04.520
I have figured out a way
to pay my bills

35:04.604 --> 35:06.439
without shoveling shit.

35:06.522 --> 35:08.566
And it is a good feeling.

35:08.649 --> 35:10.359
Well, chin-chin.

35:10.443 --> 35:11.486
(laughs)

35:11.569 --> 35:13.529
You going to tell me how?

35:13.613 --> 35:15.823
No. You'd be too scandalized.

35:15.907 --> 35:17.283
(gasps) Oh, my!

35:17.366 --> 35:19.577
You clearly don't know me
very well.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.454
(clears throat)
Some things

35:21.537 --> 35:23.289
are just better kept to oneself,

35:23.372 --> 35:26.042
even if they are brilliant.

35:26.125 --> 35:28.878
Come on! Spill the beans!

35:32.173 --> 35:33.299
Oh, God.

35:35.676 --> 35:36.886
Can you keep a secret?

35:36.969 --> 35:40.014
I have no one to tell.
All my friends are dead.

35:41.724 --> 35:46.187
Quite by accident,
I find myself in a rather...

35:46.270 --> 35:47.438
criminal position.

35:47.522 --> 35:51.567
I can't fathom
what criminal activity

35:51.651 --> 35:52.902
you could possibly involve in,

35:52.985 --> 35:54.254
except a crime of fashion,
of course.

35:54.278 --> 35:57.406
(whispering)
I'm embellishing...

35:57.490 --> 35:59.534
documents, if you will.

35:59.617 --> 36:01.494
Are you forging checks?

36:01.577 --> 36:02.620
No.

36:02.703 --> 36:05.289
Literary letters
by prominent writers.

36:05.373 --> 36:08.668
Not checks, not money,
just letters?

36:08.751 --> 36:12.255
You're not understanding
the world of elite...

36:12.338 --> 36:15.383
collectible, literary artifacts.

36:15.466 --> 36:17.510
I suppose not.
But how thrilling

36:17.593 --> 36:20.388
to be forging pieces of paper
that go where?

36:20.471 --> 36:21.556
Libraries?

36:21.639 --> 36:23.599
No, I am selling to collectors.

36:23.683 --> 36:25.142
How much are
you getting for them?

36:25.226 --> 36:27.019
I don't know why I told you.

36:27.103 --> 36:28.855
It's a waste of a secret.

36:28.938 --> 36:30.040
I should have gone out there

36:30.064 --> 36:31.524
and gotten a rock
and told the rock,

36:31.607 --> 36:33.276
'cause I'd get
a better response.

36:33.359 --> 36:35.278
Who else have
you told about this?

36:37.655 --> 36:39.215
You're not the only one
without friends.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.575
(both laugh)

36:40.658 --> 36:43.119
No. I remember you had someone.

36:43.202 --> 36:44.912
We broke up.
She was a pain in my ass.

36:44.996 --> 36:45.997
Why?

36:46.080 --> 36:48.040
Because she wanted things.

36:48.124 --> 36:49.458
Like what? Money?

36:49.542 --> 36:50.543
No.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.087
She wanted me to listen
to her troubles,

36:53.170 --> 36:55.256
and become closer
with her friends

36:55.339 --> 36:57.633
and shit like that.

36:57.717 --> 36:59.260
The nerve.

37:01.470 --> 37:05.308
I haven't been in a relationship
for years.

37:06.183 --> 37:08.936
It's very hard to meet
someone at my age.

37:09.020 --> 37:10.354
I'm losing my hair.

37:10.438 --> 37:12.648
(whispering)
I don't think that's the reason.

37:16.611 --> 37:18.446
Wasn't this, uh...

37:18.529 --> 37:21.532
One line here was particularly
clever, don't you think?

37:21.699 --> 37:24.577
It's wonderful.
I love his writing.

37:24.660 --> 37:28.164
And Dorothy Parker as well.
Caustic wit, you know?

37:28.247 --> 37:29.790
Caustic wit is my religion.

37:29.874 --> 37:33.419
I can't carry it off.
You certainly can.

37:33.502 --> 37:35.582
Doesn't help too much in
the relationship department.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.381
I'm sure that's not true.

37:40.343 --> 37:42.345
Okay, shall we settle up?

37:42.428 --> 37:43.512
Yeah.

37:48.726 --> 37:50.686
I know. Cash.

37:50.770 --> 37:51.896
(Lee chuckles)

37:59.070 --> 38:00.696
This has my number.

38:00.780 --> 38:03.532
Well, the number of the store.

38:04.825 --> 38:06.786
If you're ever
in the neighborhood,

38:06.869 --> 38:09.705
and, you know, want to get
a drink or coffee sometime.

38:13.626 --> 38:14.627
Sounds good.

38:16.337 --> 38:17.630
I would like that.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.102
(indistinct chatter)

38:35.982 --> 38:37.149
LEE: You look like shit.

38:37.233 --> 38:38.359
Oh, ditto.

38:44.740 --> 38:47.243
You are looking
at one month's rent.

38:50.538 --> 38:51.539
Who's Marlene?

38:52.915 --> 38:54.709
It's Marlene.

38:54.792 --> 38:56.877
God, I don't know why
I bother showing you anything.

38:56.961 --> 38:58.087
How much did you get?

38:59.255 --> 39:00.589
I got $400 for two.

39:00.756 --> 39:02.508
That's a little more
than I just made.

39:02.675 --> 39:04.510
What?

39:04.593 --> 39:06.220
I just sold a little coke.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.140
Right here? To whom?

39:09.223 --> 39:11.767
Some fool. Mostly laxative.
Just left.

39:11.851 --> 39:13.185
You know what? Do me a favor

39:13.269 --> 39:14.746
and keep me away
from your seedy dealings.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.772
- (Jack laughing)
- KURT: Hello, ladies.

39:16.856 --> 39:18.399
LEE: I resent that.

39:19.275 --> 39:21.402
Mmm. May I ask...
(clears throat)

39:21.485 --> 39:23.487
...how sweet your
cinnamon roll is?

39:23.654 --> 39:25.781
It's perfect.

39:25.906 --> 39:27.324
If you don't like it,
I'll eat it.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.701
Oh.

39:31.328 --> 39:32.413
Yeah, I'll have a coffee.

39:32.538 --> 39:34.290
Oh.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.500
'Course I can.
And can you warm it up?

39:40.254 --> 39:42.548
How are you gonna eat it
with his dick in your mouth?

39:42.631 --> 39:43.758
First things first.
Hmm.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.135
God, you're shameless.

39:46.218 --> 39:47.720
He started it.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.263
Oh, help yourself.

39:49.388 --> 39:50.514
Okay.

39:51.515 --> 39:53.893
So, now we've both
got some money.

39:53.976 --> 39:55.019
What are we gonna do?

39:55.728 --> 39:56.728
What do you mean?

39:57.146 --> 39:59.732
Gamble? Shop? Drink?

39:59.815 --> 40:00.855
I don't suppose you dance?

40:00.983 --> 40:05.071
Unlike you, I prefer to put
my money to good use.

40:05.154 --> 40:07.406
Like buying groceries
or securing shelter.

40:07.573 --> 40:09.658
I just thought
we should do something.

40:09.742 --> 40:11.494
I mean, life is dreary.

They most certainly
do not have booze.

42:47.858 --> 42:50.069
- Maybe you can find some coke.
- (Jack growls)

42:51.028 --> 42:52.363
JACK: How much is that?

42:52.696 --> 42:53.864
$200.

42:55.449 --> 42:57.576
How do you know
he really signed it?

42:58.827 --> 43:00.079
It's authenticated.

43:00.329 --> 43:03.123
By whom?
HARRY: By an authenticator.

43:03.207 --> 43:05.167
- (Lee chuckling)
- Silly twat.

43:06.794 --> 43:08.545
Oh, look, cards.

43:08.629 --> 43:10.631
(indistinct chatter)

43:11.423 --> 43:13.342
- JACK: Hello.
- Hi.

43:13.425 --> 43:14.510
JACK: Hey, Carl.

43:15.261 --> 43:16.262
Hi.

43:17.179 --> 43:19.890
- Such a hoot, isn't he?
- Brilliant.

43:19.974 --> 43:21.558
- (Nell laughing)
- Such a hoot.

43:21.642 --> 43:22.977
- (chuckles)
- NELL: Oh!

43:23.060 --> 43:25.271
- Take a look at this beauty.
- (mouths words)

43:25.354 --> 43:27.940
I just got this one in.

43:29.149 --> 43:31.026
Dorothy Parker.

43:32.319 --> 43:33.946
LEE: Wow.

43:34.029 --> 43:35.447
I was born 30 years too late.

43:35.531 --> 43:37.866
(chuckles)
I feel the same way.

43:38.033 --> 43:39.660
How much is that?

43:39.743 --> 43:41.954
Oh, that...

43:42.037 --> 43:44.498
We're not buying.
We're just looking today.

43:44.581 --> 43:47.042
No problem.
I am asking $600.

43:47.126 --> 43:49.003
Wow!

43:49.086 --> 43:50.879
(Jack and Nell laughing)

43:52.298 --> 43:54.091
But if you are tempted,

43:54.174 --> 43:55.551
make sure you do
your homework.

43:55.634 --> 43:59.930
Not all of the other dealers
are as discerning as we are.

44:00.014 --> 44:01.181
Oh?

44:01.265 --> 44:04.643
Some care more than others
about getting the real thing.

44:06.812 --> 44:10.357
Just in case,
who should we look out for?

44:11.817 --> 44:13.193
That one.

44:13.277 --> 44:14.445
JACK: The bowtie?

44:15.779 --> 44:18.532
I'd stay away from him.

44:18.615 --> 44:20.451
LEE:
You run your mouth too much.

44:20.534 --> 44:21.970
- JACK: What'd I say?
- LEE: Too much.

44:21.994 --> 44:24.079
Oh, good.
He's almost finished.

44:24.163 --> 44:25.289
Let's go to your place.

44:25.372 --> 44:26.415
- Come on.
- Finally.

44:26.498 --> 44:28.375
Those flies are
driving me crazy.

44:33.922 --> 44:35.257
(latch clicks)

44:36.633 --> 44:38.093
(flies buzzing)

44:40.971 --> 44:43.432
Oh! It smells horrible.

44:43.515 --> 44:46.018
I'll come back when
it's cleaned up.

44:47.353 --> 44:49.313
What's going on in there?

44:49.396 --> 44:51.440
LEE: What? Nothing.

44:51.523 --> 44:52.733
It smells really bad.

44:52.816 --> 44:54.860
Yeah, do you think I'm deaf?

44:54.943 --> 44:56.528
I heard them.

44:58.280 --> 45:01.283
Jesus, I'll do some
straightening.

45:01.367 --> 45:02.242
(latch clicks)

45:02.326 --> 45:04.745
(flies buzzing)

45:04.828 --> 45:05.829
(sighs)

45:07.498 --> 45:08.749
(knocking on door)

45:09.458 --> 45:11.168
JACK: I don't mind, Lee.
Come on.

45:11.251 --> 45:13.337
Let me in.
I'll come and help you.

45:13.420 --> 45:14.546
(knocking continues)

45:32.022 --> 45:33.357
(Jersey yowls)

45:36.902 --> 45:38.404
(flies buzzing)

45:38.487 --> 45:39.988
Oh, my God!

45:40.989 --> 45:42.366
(Lee gags)

45:48.622 --> 45:49.915
Oh, God.

45:54.420 --> 45:55.963
That's the last of it.

45:57.714 --> 45:58.882
Ugh.

45:58.966 --> 46:00.509
I need a break.

46:05.097 --> 46:10.811

46:10.894 --> 46:11.979

46:16.024 --> 46:17.151
Who is this?

46:17.317 --> 46:19.528
<i>You called me.</i>

46:19.611 --> 46:21.238
What is your name?

46:21.321 --> 46:22.448
<i>What's your name?</i>

46:22.531 --> 46:24.491
Harrison fucking Ford.

46:24.575 --> 46:26.118
- Who the hell are you?
- (hangs up)

46:26.201 --> 46:27.369

46:42.384 --> 46:44.678
<i>I'm sorry.
She's unavailable right now.</i>

46:44.761 --> 46:46.305
Oh, I see.

46:46.388 --> 46:49.141
Will you please leave
word for her that I called?

46:49.224 --> 46:50.267
Thank you.

47:03.697 --> 47:04.948
<i>MARJORIE: Nora, hello.</i>

47:05.032 --> 47:06.468

47:06.492 --> 47:08.785
<i>Of course it is.
So wonderful to hear from you.</i>

47:08.869 --> 47:10.287
You star fucker!

47:10.370 --> 47:11.830
Is that one word or two?

(both laughing)

47:21.131 --> 47:22.758
Who's Elaine?

47:25.761 --> 47:27.638
None of your business.

47:32.351 --> 47:34.311
CLERK: Came out well.
Don't you think?

47:34.561 --> 47:35.854
Lovely.

47:37.606 --> 47:40.067
Okay, Miss Parker,
that will be $35.50.

47:41.652 --> 47:42.819

47:45.948 --> 47:46.949
<i>LEE: Dear Joshua,</i>

47:47.032 --> 47:48.742
<i>Alan told me to write

<i>I have a hangover

47:52.496 --> 47:54.915
<i>I'm sure I must have
said something terrible.</i>

<i>To save me this kind
of exertion in the future,</i>

47:57.626 --> 47:58.794

48:12.683 --> 48:13.934

Dear friend.</i>

48:16.395 --> 48:18.564
<i>Gertrude Stein was right
about the roses,</i>

48:18.647 --> 48:20.899
<i>but she was
all wet about California.</i>

48:20.983 --> 48:23.318
<i>She said there
was no "there," there.</i>

48:23.402 --> 48:25.112
<i>Well, I'm here

48:47.801 --> 48:49.428
No, I robbed a bank.

48:49.511 --> 48:50.637
Miss Israel.

48:50.721 --> 48:51.805
How you doing, Mrs. Ungur?

48:51.888 --> 48:52.991
Thank you for those cookies.

48:53.015 --> 48:55.017
Those were good cookies,
weren't they?

48:55.100 --> 48:57.477
Not as good as
the chocolate babka, but good.

48:57.644 --> 48:59.980
I'll have to remember that.

49:00.063 --> 49:02.274
Hey, tell your son
to go easy on me, huh?

49:02.357 --> 49:04.568
Can't kick a old dog
out on the street, right?

49:06.278 --> 49:07.630
<i>LEE:

49:25.714 --> 49:27.174
- You're Lee?
- (door closes)

49:27.299 --> 49:29.259
Ms. Israel.
Alan.

49:31.637 --> 49:32.971
So, what do you got?

49:33.138 --> 49:34.389
Uh...

49:38.060 --> 49:39.394
ALAN: Mmm.

49:41.521 --> 49:43.106
Mm-hmm.

49:43.190 --> 49:45.567
Very witty, don't you think?

49:45.651 --> 49:48.320
She had quite the mouth.

49:49.321 --> 49:52.574
I think what she had was
a very big personality.

49:52.658 --> 49:56.286
Uh-huh. Liked the ladies,
too, I heard.

49:56.453 --> 49:57.996
You sure these
are the real thing?

50:00.832 --> 50:02.292
I assume so.

50:02.376 --> 50:06.088
Nah, most people will believe
anything you tell them anyway.

50:06.171 --> 50:08.340
And people love this stuff.

50:08.423 --> 50:10.467
Personally, I don't get it.

50:10.634 --> 50:15.013
To Fanny Brice, Noël Coward,
and Dorothy Parker.

50:15.097 --> 50:17.933
May their brilliance live on.

50:18.016 --> 50:22.187
And to Lee, a brilliant writer
who happens to still be alive.

50:22.270 --> 50:24.189
- That's negotiable.
- (Anna chuckles)

50:25.524 --> 50:28.318
Wouldn't it be incredible if,
after you passed on...

50:28.402 --> 50:30.320
people were
selling your letters?

50:30.404 --> 50:32.030
Why on earth would I want that?

50:32.114 --> 50:33.240
Well, because.

50:33.407 --> 50:34.727
Most of us mortals
just disappear.

50:34.783 --> 50:37.035
This way,
you still kind of exist.

50:37.119 --> 50:39.621
No. When I die, who cares?

50:39.705 --> 50:42.082
I just want somebody
to feed my cat.

50:42.165 --> 50:43.667
I'll feed your cat.

50:44.960 --> 50:46.920
Thank you.

50:47.003 --> 50:48.672
Have you ever written
about yourself?

50:48.755 --> 50:51.591
Nah. I don't think I'd find
myself very interesting.

50:51.675 --> 50:53.385
I would. You should.

50:53.468 --> 50:54.970
Instead of waiting for someone

50:55.053 --> 50:57.347
to write a biography
about you.

50:58.557 --> 51:01.101
You're very flattering, Anna.

51:02.853 --> 51:03.895
(chuckles)

51:03.979 --> 51:07.190
I can't believe
that I'm doing this, but...

51:08.692 --> 51:10.569
Here's one of my stories.

51:10.819 --> 51:12.404
(chuckles)
You brought it with you.

51:12.487 --> 51:14.489
I'm an idiot, I know.

51:14.573 --> 51:16.575
No, I mean, I'll give it a read.

51:16.658 --> 51:18.744
I've only taken
a couple of classes...

51:18.827 --> 51:21.788
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm... I'm honored.

51:32.299 --> 51:34.050
You wear glasses.

51:34.134 --> 51:36.261
(giggles) Only recently.

51:36.344 --> 51:38.180
I like them.
They look good.

51:38.889 --> 51:41.391
I wasn't sure about the frames.

51:41.475 --> 51:43.435
(softly)
They're nice.

51:43.518 --> 51:45.812
I used to have perfect vision.

51:45.896 --> 51:47.564
Don't you hate getting older

51:47.647 --> 51:50.025
and watching
your parts fall apart?

51:50.108 --> 51:51.485
Nah. You're too young.

51:51.610 --> 51:52.903
Hardly.

51:52.986 --> 51:55.071
I really thought that
I'd have accomplished

51:55.155 --> 51:56.448
more by this time in my life.

51:56.531 --> 51:58.992
You just need
to drink more alcohol.

51:59.075 --> 52:02.621
I mean, plus,
you own the shop, right?

52:03.747 --> 52:06.625
Well, I inherited it, yeah.

52:06.708 --> 52:10.086
Truth be told, it's more
pressure than I thought.

52:11.546 --> 52:14.257
My father took real pride in it.

52:14.341 --> 52:15.801
Almost too much.

52:16.384 --> 52:19.221
I try to live up to that.

52:21.473 --> 52:23.350
Where did you grow up?

52:23.433 --> 52:25.310
Woodside, Queens.

52:25.393 --> 52:28.855
My parents live in Florida,
may they rest in peace.

52:28.939 --> 52:30.219
I also have a ridiculous brother

52:30.273 --> 52:32.651
who lives on Long Island, so...

52:33.151 --> 52:34.402
What about you?

52:34.528 --> 52:35.987
I'm an only child...

52:36.071 --> 52:38.365
but I'm close with a few
of my cousins, though.

52:38.532 --> 52:41.076
I think I have some cousins.
I think.

52:41.159 --> 52:42.410
(both chuckling)

52:42.494 --> 52:43.954
Not into the family thing?

52:44.037 --> 52:45.747
No, I like my alone time.

52:46.706 --> 52:49.626
Well, not every second, though.

52:49.709 --> 52:51.044
You're here with me right now.

52:53.171 --> 52:56.591
Oh, hey.
I always need a drinking buddy.

53:13.358 --> 53:14.943
(Lee chuckles nervously)

53:15.068 --> 53:16.736
(indistinct chatter)

53:17.737 --> 53:19.698
Thank you. That was fun.

53:19.781 --> 53:21.533
I think I'm a little tipsy.
Are you?

53:21.616 --> 53:22.993
It takes a lot more than that.

53:23.076 --> 53:25.620
Oh, no.
Have I embarrassed myself?

53:25.704 --> 53:27.038
What did Dorothy say?

53:27.122 --> 53:29.457
"Can you ever forgive me?"

53:34.462 --> 53:37.048
What?
Did I say something wrong?

53:37.799 --> 53:38.925
No.

53:39.009 --> 53:41.094
You didn't say anything wrong.

53:41.177 --> 53:42.470
Good.

53:44.472 --> 53:45.849
This has been very nice.

53:47.017 --> 53:48.602
It was.

53:49.603 --> 53:51.229
It's always nice
to make a new friend.

53:52.981 --> 53:54.774
Indeed.

53:55.942 --> 53:57.527
Speak soon?

53:57.819 --> 53:59.738
When I read your story,
I'll let you know.

53:59.821 --> 54:01.907
I'm pretty busy these days,

54:01.990 --> 54:05.869
so I don't know if I'll get
to it right away, but...

54:07.412 --> 54:08.496
That's okay.

54:09.497 --> 54:10.498
Good night.

54:10.582 --> 54:12.000
Good night.

55:11.518 --> 55:12.602
(clears throat)

55:20.694 --> 55:22.362
<i>LEE: My dear boy,</i>

55:22.445 --> 55:24.489
<i>I enjoyed our talk tremendously</i>

55:24.572 --> 55:27.867
<i>and was not the least bit upset
about the article.</i>

55:27.951 --> 55:29.327
<i>My professional demise</i>

55:29.411 --> 55:31.579
<i>has been gleefully
predicted for years,</i>

55:31.663 --> 55:34.416
<i>but nonetheless,
I await the return</i>

55:34.499 --> 55:36.876
<i>of your ruby-red lips
to Blue Harbor</i>

55:37.043 --> 55:39.504
<i>in the event my
spirit should falter.</i>

55:39.587 --> 55:43.049
<i>Yours and very much
anticipating,</i>

55:43.341 --> 55:45.051
<i>Noël.</i>

55:47.345 --> 55:48.680
This is quite something.

55:48.763 --> 55:49.848
(sighs in relief)

55:49.931 --> 55:51.141
I thought so, too.

55:51.224 --> 55:53.018
Well, as you know,

55:53.101 --> 55:54.978
I think I already
have a buyer for it.

55:55.061 --> 55:56.621
I'm gonna call him
as soon as you leave.

55:56.688 --> 55:57.688
(chuckles)
Huh.

55:59.315 --> 56:02.527
I sent the Marlene Dietrich
to Los Angeles.

56:02.652 --> 56:05.780
I got a request
from a collector out there.

56:06.698 --> 56:07.866
Wonderful.

56:07.949 --> 56:11.411
You guys do that?
You sell to other collectors?

56:11.578 --> 56:12.787
Oh, yeah.

56:12.871 --> 56:16.041
There's a whole world
of wheeling and dealing...

56:16.124 --> 56:18.209
most of which
I don't partake in.

56:18.293 --> 56:21.921
There are a lot of characters
in this line of work.

56:22.005 --> 56:25.800
Hey, for a while there,
we had <i>The Hitler Diaries.</i>

56:25.884 --> 56:26.801
Hmm.

56:26.885 --> 56:29.387
Remember that?

56:29.471 --> 56:30.889
Criminal.

56:32.223 --> 56:34.267
Yeah.
Not everyone gets into this

56:34.350 --> 56:38.229
because they respect
talent and history...

56:38.313 --> 56:40.565
if you know what I mean.

56:41.608 --> 56:43.068
(softly) Yep.

56:46.029 --> 56:47.781
(knocking on door)

56:50.575 --> 56:51.576
(switch clicks)

56:51.659 --> 56:53.703
(knocking continues)

56:58.500 --> 57:03.088
- (knocking intensifies)
- (Jersey meows)

57:08.635 --> 57:09.969
Lee?

57:15.850 --> 57:17.977
You really should replace
the shower curtain, Lee.

57:18.228 --> 57:21.147
You wanna discuss
decorating with me?

57:21.773 --> 57:23.566
Who beat you up?

57:23.650 --> 57:25.318
It's my own fault.

57:25.401 --> 57:26.653
I didn't have enough money,

57:26.736 --> 57:29.447
and I didn't know until after,
and...

57:29.531 --> 57:32.075
Until it was too late.

57:33.535 --> 57:35.495
I'm not even going to try
to understand that.

57:36.454 --> 57:38.873
I used to get away with so much.

57:38.957 --> 57:41.084
Do you think it'll scar?

57:42.710 --> 57:44.087
I couldn't find my keys,

57:44.170 --> 57:46.506
I couldn't get
into my apartment.

57:48.133 --> 57:49.133
What?

57:49.175 --> 57:50.802
And where is said apartment?

57:52.428 --> 57:53.638
(stammering)

57:53.721 --> 57:56.182
It was on Ninety-Second...

57:56.266 --> 57:59.060
then it was on Ninety-Sixth.

57:59.144 --> 58:00.687
You...

58:01.813 --> 58:04.232
You can sleep on my couch.

58:05.191 --> 58:07.193
Thank you.

58:13.491 --> 58:15.577
WAITRESS:
Are you ready to order?

58:15.660 --> 58:18.872
Uh, yeah, I'll have a burger,
rare, with onions.

58:18.955 --> 58:21.332
I'll have the same, thanks.

58:21.416 --> 58:24.252
You said you wanted a steak.
Get a steak.

58:24.335 --> 58:25.879
You sure?

58:26.504 --> 58:27.755
He's gonna have the steak.

58:27.839 --> 58:28.923
Why don't you have a steak?

58:29.007 --> 58:30.633
'Cause we came here
to get you a steak.

58:30.717 --> 58:31.759
Thank you.

58:31.843 --> 58:33.136
Skirt or T-bone?

58:36.806 --> 58:39.934
He's gonna have the T-bone,
medium-rare,

58:40.018 --> 58:41.477
and we'll have another round.

58:43.897 --> 58:45.857
How've you gotten by
as long as you have?

58:45.940 --> 58:49.777
Do not underestimate
sparkly blue eyes...

58:49.861 --> 58:51.613
and a little bit of street smarts.

58:51.696 --> 58:54.032
They go a long way in this city.

58:54.115 --> 58:57.702
Although I may have stretched
my limits recently.

58:57.785 --> 59:00.121
Yeah, but who did you wanna be?

59:00.205 --> 59:02.457
I mean,
what was the actual plan?

59:02.540 --> 59:04.709
I honestly don't know
what to say.

59:04.792 --> 59:07.962
I imagined I'd figure it out
as I went along,

59:08.046 --> 59:09.505
and for the most part, I have.

59:09.589 --> 59:11.132
I certainly have no regrets.

59:11.216 --> 59:13.301
That can't be true.

59:13.384 --> 59:14.844
Oh.

59:14.928 --> 59:17.805
You mean, why don't I have

59:17.889 --> 59:19.933
some brilliant talent for
copying like you do?

59:21.100 --> 59:22.328
Is that what you
think I'm doing?

59:22.352 --> 59:23.728
- You think I'm copying?
- Mm-hmm.

59:23.811 --> 59:25.480
I'll have you know, I'm a better

59:25.563 --> 59:27.482
Dorothy Parker
than Dorothy Parker.

59:27.565 --> 59:29.692
Oh, I'll drink to that. Cheers.

59:33.279 --> 59:34.489
(door closes)

59:41.412 --> 59:44.249
- Get your feet off the couch.
- Really?

59:44.332 --> 59:45.250
Look at it.

59:45.333 --> 59:47.001
This is not a flop house.

59:47.085 --> 59:48.836
(grunts)

59:48.920 --> 59:51.005
(Jersey meows)

59:51.089 --> 59:52.131
There you go.

59:52.215 --> 59:53.925
How old is that old
hairball anyway?

59:54.008 --> 59:56.052
She's 12.

59:56.135 --> 59:59.472
That is fucking old.
What's that in cat years?

59:59.555 --> 01:00:01.182
(laughs)

01:00:01.266 --> 01:00:02.475
(machine beeps)

01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:05.061
<i>This is Paul from Armada Books.</i>

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:08.606
<i>Ms. Israel, I was wondering
if you could come in tomorrow?</i>

01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.566
<i>I have a couple
of questions regarding</i>

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.361
<i>the last Coward
letter I purchased.</i>

01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:16.364
<i>Please come in or call
as soon as you can.</i>

01:00:16.447 --> 01:00:17.490
Uh-oh.

01:00:17.573 --> 01:00:19.450
- (shushes)
<i>- It's important.</i>

01:00:19.534 --> 01:00:20.785
(machine beeps)

01:00:53.359 --> 01:00:56.446
PAUL: Thank you.
Thank you for bringing it in.

01:00:58.156 --> 01:00:59.824
Hi, Lee.

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:01.993
What seems to be the problem?

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:07.206
You know I've got that client
who knew Noël Coward.

01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:09.959
And he said that...

01:01:10.043 --> 01:01:14.130
Mr. Coward would never have been
as explicit as he was

01:01:14.213 --> 01:01:18.217
regarding his orientation.

01:01:18.301 --> 01:01:21.054
It was illegal
in those days, and...

01:01:21.137 --> 01:01:24.474
Anyway, apparently,
the letter is a fake.

01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:26.434
I'm shocked.

01:01:26.517 --> 01:01:29.270
I mean, my uncle
would be appalled.

01:01:29.354 --> 01:01:31.230
You mean, your cousin?

01:01:31.314 --> 01:01:32.398
Yes.

01:01:32.482 --> 01:01:37.695
My cousin has always been
very avuncular toward me, so...

01:01:39.197 --> 01:01:40.531
(sighs)

01:01:44.369 --> 01:01:49.582
I also got a call
from Los Angeles, Lee.

01:01:49.665 --> 01:01:54.003
It seems one of your letters
was quite the controversy

01:01:54.087 --> 01:01:56.547
at a convention out there.

01:01:57.548 --> 01:02:00.718
I hate to say it, but your
name's been put on a list.

01:02:02.261 --> 01:02:03.388
On a list?

01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:05.681
People are on alert.

01:02:06.682 --> 01:02:07.975
That's all.

01:02:08.935 --> 01:02:11.229
They won't buy from you anymore.

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:30.123
Hello?

01:02:31.124 --> 01:02:32.417
(toilet flushing)

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:33.709
Alan?

01:02:35.128 --> 01:02:37.213
You got my messages.

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:39.382
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

01:02:39.465 --> 01:02:42.635
I brought some wonderful
Faulkners that I unearthed.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.178
Not why I called.

01:02:44.262 --> 01:02:46.556
Listen, the FBI has been
in here to see me.

01:02:47.723 --> 01:02:49.308
The FBI?

01:02:49.392 --> 01:02:51.144
They asked me to wear a wire.

01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:56.566
I'm not gonna do that to you.
I'm a good guy.

01:02:56.649 --> 01:02:58.359
And if they want
me to be a witness...

01:02:58.443 --> 01:03:00.194
I'll lie.

01:03:00.278 --> 01:03:03.531
But you're gonna pay me $5,000.

01:03:06.367 --> 01:03:09.036
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.538
(scoffs)

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:13.416
Well, come on, I'm not gonna
rat you out or anything.

01:03:13.499 --> 01:03:16.085
That's very generous of you.

01:03:17.587 --> 01:03:20.173
I don't have $5,000.

01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:23.718
You're a clever woman.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.803
Figure it out.

01:03:32.727 --> 01:03:34.103
Oh, hello, welcome.

01:03:34.187 --> 01:03:36.063
Oh, thank you very much.
Um...

01:03:36.647 --> 01:03:38.483
My grandmother just died, and...

01:03:38.566 --> 01:03:39.650
- Oh.
- No, it's all right.

01:03:39.734 --> 01:03:40.902
And I discovered these

01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:42.403
when I was going
through her closet

01:03:42.528 --> 01:03:46.491
and wondered if they might be
of interest to you or not.

01:03:46.574 --> 01:03:48.826
- "Edna Ferber."
- You've heard of her?

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:50.328
Oh, yes.

01:03:50.411 --> 01:03:53.122
She wrote that movie
with James Dean.

01:03:53.206 --> 01:03:55.666
I guess I'm not really up
on all these things.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:59.504
Just look at that.
Such wonderful knick-knacks.

01:03:59.587 --> 01:04:02.798
So your granny
collected letters?

01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:04.276
I don't know any
of the people in them,

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.886
but I feel they
must be worth something.

01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:08.554
And how did you know

01:04:08.638 --> 01:04:10.139
that I bought
this kind of thing?

01:04:10.223 --> 01:04:12.391
- Do you?
- Sure.

01:04:12.475 --> 01:04:17.021
Yeah. I could give
you $50 a piece.

01:04:17.104 --> 01:04:18.689
I feel I could
do better than that.

01:04:18.773 --> 01:04:20.858
No offense,
but a store in Brooklyn

01:04:20.942 --> 01:04:24.070
offered me $200 for one.

01:04:24.153 --> 01:04:25.738
For one?

01:04:25.821 --> 01:04:27.865
Why didn't you sell
it to them, then?

01:04:29.492 --> 01:04:31.202
I hate the boroughs.

01:04:31.536 --> 01:04:32.995
I'm really good at this.

01:04:33.079 --> 01:04:34.539
You should see me at it.

01:04:34.664 --> 01:04:36.249
When last did you go outside,
Lee?

01:04:36.374 --> 01:04:37.500
How much did you get?

01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:40.044
First place gave me $600.

01:04:40.127 --> 01:04:42.713
The other guy gave me $1,000.

01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.507
You just got closer
to paying back

01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:47.385
that asshole with his own money.

01:04:47.468 --> 01:04:49.470
He gave me $1,000!

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:51.722
- Was he suspicious?
- Oh, hell, no.

01:04:51.806 --> 01:04:53.326
I always did want to
be an actor. Here.

01:05:04.443 --> 01:05:05.903
How much did you say
he gave you?

01:05:06.445 --> 01:05:07.655
What?

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:11.117
You're stealing from me?

01:05:11.284 --> 01:05:13.411
No. Uh...

01:05:13.494 --> 01:05:15.037
What did I say?

01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:18.583
He gave me $1,400 plus 600.
I mean...

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:20.227
- Isn't that what I said?
- No, moron.

01:05:20.251 --> 01:05:21.335
It's not what you said.

01:05:21.419 --> 01:05:22.670
You're stealing from me...

01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:24.922
and you don't even know
what it is you're selling.

01:05:25.047 --> 01:05:26.340
Okay.

01:05:26.424 --> 01:05:27.925
I made a mistake.

01:05:28.009 --> 01:05:30.720
Okay? Here. Here.

01:05:31.512 --> 01:05:32.512
Here.

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.767
Okay,
they're literary treasures.

01:05:36.851 --> 01:05:39.854
One of a kind, carefully written
witticisms, okay?

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:42.481
They're not just
a piece of paper.

01:05:42.607 --> 01:05:46.152
It's a portal into a better time

01:05:46.235 --> 01:05:48.070
and a better place where people

01:05:48.154 --> 01:05:50.615
still actually honored
the written word.

01:05:50.698 --> 01:05:52.116
Okay! I get it.

01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:53.409
Yeah, do you get it?

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:54.785
You better learn how to respect

01:05:54.869 --> 01:05:55.911
what it is you're selling,

01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:57.622
because it's my writing!

01:05:57.705 --> 01:05:59.332
Well...

01:06:00.374 --> 01:06:01.584
What?

01:06:02.335 --> 01:06:04.629
I mean...

01:06:04.712 --> 01:06:06.088
you're impersonating
other people,

01:06:06.172 --> 01:06:07.274
I mean, very well, I'm sure,

01:06:07.298 --> 01:06:08.591
but come on.

01:06:08.674 --> 01:06:10.718
Nobody is buying
Lee Israel letters.

01:06:16.766 --> 01:06:19.894
You steal from me again,
and I'll fucking kill you.

01:06:28.611 --> 01:06:31.280
(rock music playing)

01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:02.103
(rock music continues)

01:07:06.691 --> 01:07:07.983
This was your grandmother's?

01:07:08.067 --> 01:07:11.028
Found it in her suitcase.
I assume it's real.

01:07:11.112 --> 01:07:12.196
Do you think it's real?

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:14.407
- Looks that way.
- Good.

01:07:14.532 --> 01:07:16.385
But there have been
some forgeries going around,

01:07:16.409 --> 01:07:17.969
so I'm gonna have
to get it authenticated

01:07:17.993 --> 01:07:19.793
before I can purchase it,
if that's all right.

01:07:20.621 --> 01:07:21.956
You brought it back, right?

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:25.710
I couldn't.
I didn't know what to do.

01:07:25.793 --> 01:07:27.878
LEE: You left it there?
Gosh, you idiot.

01:07:28.003 --> 01:07:29.630
Stop calling me an idiot.

01:07:29.714 --> 01:07:31.924
I'm gonna go to jail for this.

01:07:32.091 --> 01:07:34.260
I'm just gonna
kill myself first.

01:07:34.343 --> 01:07:36.679
And you can't do this anymore.

01:07:36.804 --> 01:07:39.181
Lee, come on.
We can't stop now.

01:07:39.265 --> 01:07:40.725
Well, everybody
is on high alert.

01:07:40.808 --> 01:07:43.477
I don't have a shot at paying
that schmuck back.

01:07:43.561 --> 01:07:45.563
Maybe you could
steal more real ones

01:07:45.646 --> 01:07:47.857
like you did at first,
and I'll sell them.

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.775
Finding those letters
was a complete fluke.

01:07:49.859 --> 01:07:51.986
Well, where did
the real ones go?

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:53.154
Who has those?

01:07:53.362 --> 01:07:55.281
Archives and museums.

01:07:55.364 --> 01:07:58.242
And you have to have proof
that you're doing research.

01:07:58.409 --> 01:08:00.286
They don't just let
anybody walk in.

01:08:00.369 --> 01:08:03.456
You can get into archives.
You're a famous writer.

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.126
You can steal the letters,
copy them...

01:08:07.209 --> 01:08:10.171
replace them with your copies,
sell the originals.

01:08:11.839 --> 01:08:14.300
In my sticky finger days...

01:08:14.383 --> 01:08:16.093
I'd choose the thing
that I wanted...

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:19.013
the things always had to come
in boxes like toothpaste...

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.890
and then when nobody
is paying attention,

01:08:21.974 --> 01:08:23.684
I'd take the toothpaste
out of the box,

01:08:23.768 --> 01:08:24.935
slip it into my pocket,

01:08:25.019 --> 01:08:27.645
and replace it with a used tube.

01:08:27.813 --> 01:08:29.689
If anyone was suspicious,

01:08:29.857 --> 01:08:34.069
they'd come back to the shelf
and see nothing is missing.

01:08:34.153 --> 01:08:37.238
(laughing)

01:08:37.323 --> 01:08:38.948
Win-win, baby.

01:08:40.826 --> 01:08:43.287
Well, not the store.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:44.703
What do you mean?

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:48.792
Win-win doesn't apply
to the story you just told.

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:50.839
You always put a downer
on everything, you know.

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.712
Just eat your noodles.

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:55.758
She needs fresh water...

01:08:55.841 --> 01:08:57.843
and two pills twice a day.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:09:00.429
And you gotta
mash it up in the...

01:09:00.638 --> 01:09:01.639
Knock it off.

01:09:01.721 --> 01:09:03.450
You gotta mash it up
in the food like I showed you.

01:09:03.474 --> 01:09:05.975
- I will.
- No snooping.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.270
Stay out of my bed,
and no smoking.

01:09:08.437 --> 01:09:09.437
Okay.

01:09:12.066 --> 01:09:13.359
LEE: All right.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:16.904
(door opens, closes)

01:09:33.629 --> 01:09:34.796
(sighs)

01:09:47.184 --> 01:09:49.395
(indistinct chatter)

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.859
(doorbell buzzing)

01:10:01.323 --> 01:10:02.533
Can I help you?

01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:05.619
Let's hope.
I'm doing a in-depth look

01:10:05.703 --> 01:10:07.121
at writers and alcoholism.

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:09.373
Hence, Lillian Hellman.

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:12.209
Here's my contract
with my publisher.

01:10:12.293 --> 01:10:14.461
I'm primarily interested in

01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:16.964
more personal,
archival materials.

01:10:17.298 --> 01:10:18.883
You know,
any kind of correspondence...

01:10:18.966 --> 01:10:20.801
letters, diaries, journals.

01:10:20.885 --> 01:10:22.428
I'll give you what we've got.

01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:28.392
I told him I had to
get it authenticated.

01:10:28.475 --> 01:10:30.227
He seemed pretty nervous.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.906
Does this look familiar?

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.560
PAUL:
Yes, I bought this from her.

What is all this stuff?

01:11:22.947 --> 01:11:25.199
Why do you collect
old typewriters?

01:11:25.282 --> 01:11:28.827
It's too complicated to explain.
It's my work.

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:32.414
I don't invite many people
to my home.

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:35.084
I'm a very private person.

01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:38.003
Well, I take it you're not much
of a TV watcher.

01:11:38.879 --> 01:11:40.547
Rots the brain.
I don't believe in it.

01:11:40.631 --> 01:11:41.840
I'm a reader.

01:11:41.924 --> 01:11:43.217
(chuckles)

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.427

01:11:48.597 --> 01:11:50.599
- What do you got here?

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:53.852
Oh, a little coke,
a little dope...

01:11:53.936 --> 01:11:56.563
and little old me.

01:11:58.190 --> 01:11:59.608

01:12:01.527 --> 01:12:03.612

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:17.960

01:12:20.587 --> 01:12:22.548
Yes, this is Lee Israel.

01:12:26.677 --> 01:12:28.095

<i>This is Marie.</i>

01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:32.641
Well, okay, Marie.

01:12:32.725 --> 01:12:35.602
Could you please
tell her that I called?

01:12:35.686 --> 01:12:37.062
Same number.

01:12:37.146 --> 01:12:38.856
Thank you.

Psst-psst-psst-psst.

01:13:17.394 --> 01:13:19.438
Two.

01:13:25.027 --> 01:13:27.237
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Psst.

01:13:28.197 --> 01:13:29.573
Ugh.

01:13:29.656 --> 01:13:31.116
Jersey.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.368
Psst-psst-psst-psst.

01:13:33.452 --> 01:13:35.704
Psst. Come and get it.

01:13:35.788 --> 01:13:37.790

01:13:37.915 --> 01:13:39.875
Oh, thank God.

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:49.676
Ma'am.

01:13:51.762 --> 01:13:54.181
Good morning.
The Lillian Hellman box

01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:55.682
I was working on yesterday.

01:13:55.766 --> 01:13:58.560
Ah, yes, the book
on drunk authors.

01:13:58.644 --> 01:14:00.354
Who else are you gonna
be writing about?

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:02.606
You know what?
I have a bus to catch.

01:14:03.941 --> 01:14:05.651
Of course.

01:14:05.734 --> 01:14:07.778
I'll get what you need.

01:14:14.284 --> 01:14:15.577
- (softly) Fuck.
- (door closes)

01:14:26.964 --> 01:14:29.633

01:14:34.096 --> 01:14:36.056

01:14:38.517 --> 01:14:40.018

01:15:19.725 --> 01:15:20.809
(door opens)

01:15:23.604 --> 01:15:24.688
(door closes)

01:15:30.694 --> 01:15:31.820
(sighs)

01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:37.159
Here you go.
Sorry about the rush.

01:15:37.242 --> 01:15:40.037
I get overly anxious
when I travel.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.624
Oh. Of course.
I do, too.

01:16:02.142 --> 01:16:03.977
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:16:07.773 --> 01:16:08.899
(breathing heavily)

01:16:11.401 --> 01:16:13.070

01:16:18.825 --> 01:16:20.953
Jack?

01:16:21.036 --> 01:16:23.830
(groans)
Jersey, Mama's home.

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:28.919
(sighs)

01:16:30.212 --> 01:16:33.131
What has he done to our home?

01:16:33.215 --> 01:16:34.675
Huh?
(clicks tongue)

01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:37.344
Where are you?

01:16:37.427 --> 01:16:39.096
Aha.

01:16:39.179 --> 01:16:41.056
Hey, there.

01:16:41.139 --> 01:16:43.100
You hiding, huh?

01:16:54.444 --> 01:16:56.822
Oh, shit.
(crying)

01:16:57.864 --> 01:17:01.702
All right.
I know it looks bad, Lee, but...

01:17:01.785 --> 01:17:03.578
Get out.

01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:05.163
All right.

01:17:05.247 --> 01:17:08.667
I couldn't resist him.
He's so adorable.

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:09.876
You have to understand, Lee.

01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:11.545
LEE: Get out of my house.

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:13.088
JACK: Why?

01:17:13.171 --> 01:17:14.214
(continues crying)

01:17:14.339 --> 01:17:15.215
What's happened?

01:17:15.299 --> 01:17:16.591
My cat is dead!

01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:18.427
What? Oh, no.

01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:20.053
What's going on?

01:17:20.137 --> 01:17:22.889
Oh, for fuck's sake,
get the fuck out of my house!

01:17:22.973 --> 01:17:24.266
Darling, I can explain.

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:26.601
Okay, this is too
fucked up for me.

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:29.062
Lee, I'm so sorry.
It's not my fault.

01:17:29.146 --> 01:17:31.648
It must have just
happened right now.

01:17:31.732 --> 01:17:34.484
Get out. Get out! Get out!

01:17:34.568 --> 01:17:36.987
Sorry. I did what you...
(sobbing)

01:17:38.572 --> 01:17:39.656
(door closes)

01:17:40.741 --> 01:17:42.242
(sniffles)

01:17:44.661 --> 01:17:46.163
(sobbing continues)

01:17:52.252 --> 01:17:54.463
(indistinct chatter)

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:18.111
Oh, hi, Miss Israel.

01:18:18.278 --> 01:18:20.405
Is Jersey okay?

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:25.452
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

01:18:28.705 --> 01:18:30.540
Um, I don't have a backyard
or anything,

01:18:30.624 --> 01:18:32.751
so I wasn't sure
what to do with her.

01:18:32.918 --> 01:18:36.338
It's okay. We can...
We can take care of that here.

01:19:10.247 --> 01:19:12.749
LEE: Thanks for coming.
(sniffles)

01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:15.335
It sounded important.

01:19:16.545 --> 01:19:17.545
It is.

01:19:17.587 --> 01:19:21.299
Looks like you brought
Jersey with you.

01:19:21.383 --> 01:19:24.052
How is that old bitch?

01:19:24.219 --> 01:19:26.096
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

01:19:26.179 --> 01:19:28.181
She, uh...

01:19:28.265 --> 01:19:30.308
She just died.
ELAINE: Oh.

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:34.062
I just figured,
since she was a gift from you...

01:19:34.146 --> 01:19:35.856
Was she?

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:40.152
I got too attached to her.

01:19:40.235 --> 01:19:41.987
Getting another one?

01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:43.864
No.

01:19:43.947 --> 01:19:45.949
No, I couldn't replace her.

01:19:46.032 --> 01:19:47.993
That wouldn't feel right.

01:19:48.076 --> 01:19:50.245
Maybe in time.

01:19:53.248 --> 01:19:56.501
You know,
I still go to Aunt Eleanor's

01:19:56.585 --> 01:19:58.545
pretty regularly.
(chuckles)

01:19:58.712 --> 01:20:01.423
Oh, my God. I haven't thought
about that place in years.

01:20:01.506 --> 01:20:04.050
It's still there?
On Ninety-Six?

01:20:04.134 --> 01:20:06.553
Exactly the same.

01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:10.307
I mean, you know,
different cats.

01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:12.434
You still on Eighty-Second?

01:20:12.601 --> 01:20:14.561
Where else would I be?

01:20:15.145 --> 01:20:18.273
You all right?
You look all right.

01:20:19.858 --> 01:20:22.486
You can't imagine
what I've done to survive.

01:20:23.904 --> 01:20:25.739
Are you sleeping, Lee?

01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:28.158
Fits and starts.

01:20:29.493 --> 01:20:32.662
I was just supposed to be...

01:20:32.746 --> 01:20:35.832
something more than this.

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:37.000
I mean, wasn't I?

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:40.337
That's why you wanted to see me.

01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:42.881
No, I needed to see you.

01:20:45.008 --> 01:20:47.469
I'm having a crisis here.

01:20:47.552 --> 01:20:49.012
And you know me.

01:20:49.304 --> 01:20:50.388
No, Lee.

01:20:50.472 --> 01:20:52.140
There was always
a wall between us.

01:20:52.224 --> 01:20:54.267
Something I couldn't penetrate.

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:58.146
I tried.

01:20:58.230 --> 01:20:59.481
You know, God damn it, Elaine,

01:20:59.564 --> 01:21:02.776
I tried more with you
than anybody else ever.

01:21:02.943 --> 01:21:05.237
No, you didn't.

01:21:06.238 --> 01:21:08.238
You did everything you could
to keep your distance.

01:21:08.281 --> 01:21:10.784
You lied, you drank constantly,

01:21:10.867 --> 01:21:12.160
you were self-involved.

01:21:12.244 --> 01:21:14.162
Well, I didn't
say I was perfect.

01:21:14.329 --> 01:21:15.789
You were so miserable.

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:20.293
- No, I wasn't.
- ELAINE: Yes, you were.

01:21:21.336 --> 01:21:23.338
I tried to get you to trust me.

01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:25.382
Certain point,
I just stopped trying.

01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.304
Yeah, I wish you hadn't.

01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:36.518
Well, you don't have to go yet.
Come on.

01:21:36.601 --> 01:21:39.813
Lee, it's not my job anymore.

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:43.900
To talk you off the ledge.
It's exhausting.

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.072
I got a class.

01:21:53.118 --> 01:21:54.661
Let them authenticate
all they want.

01:21:54.744 --> 01:21:55.996
They're real. Don't settle.

01:21:56.162 --> 01:21:59.291
Lee. Are we gonna talk about it?

01:21:59.374 --> 01:22:00.834
I mean, I'm really sorry.

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:02.877
Okay, afterwards,
you come here immediately.

01:22:02.961 --> 01:22:05.213
I'll do good. You'll see, Lee.
I'll make it up to you.

01:22:05.297 --> 01:22:06.337
And get a written receipt.

01:22:06.381 --> 01:22:07.841
I wanna know
how much you get paid.

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:09.426
Oh, come on.

01:22:09.509 --> 01:22:12.137
How long are you gonna
freeze me out, huh?

01:22:12.220 --> 01:22:14.055
I trusted you.

01:22:14.139 --> 01:22:15.599
I don't know if you've
noticed this,

01:22:15.682 --> 01:22:17.100
but I don't do that.

01:22:17.183 --> 01:22:19.019
And you have reminded me
why that is.

01:22:19.102 --> 01:22:22.939
Lee, I took care of your cat.
I swear.

01:22:23.023 --> 01:22:25.275
It was an accident,
and I feel awful.

01:22:25.358 --> 01:22:26.651
We will continue
to work together

01:22:26.735 --> 01:22:28.111
because I have no other option.

01:22:28.194 --> 01:22:29.279
But we are not friends,

01:22:29.362 --> 01:22:30.947
and I don't think
we actually ever were.

01:22:31.031 --> 01:22:32.574
Lee. Lee.

01:22:32.657 --> 01:22:33.992
We will meet in public,

01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:35.469
and you will not
fuck this up like

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:37.093
you fuck everything
else up in your life.

01:22:37.162 --> 01:22:38.931
You will sell those papers,
you will get the money,

01:22:38.955 --> 01:22:40.165
you will bring me a receipt.

01:22:42.459 --> 01:22:44.502
I'll be back after the sale.

01:22:54.596 --> 01:22:56.306
Aren't they fabulous?

01:22:57.432 --> 01:22:59.643
I just know someone is going
to treasure them.

01:23:05.315 --> 01:23:07.567
I need another one.

01:23:07.651 --> 01:23:09.569
That's debatable.

01:23:11.446 --> 01:23:12.989
How much do you want for them?

01:23:13.448 --> 01:23:15.283
I was thinking $300, each.

01:23:18.703 --> 01:23:20.830
Actually, do you have cash?

01:23:25.794 --> 01:23:27.128
That's 500.

01:23:27.837 --> 01:23:29.297
$600.

01:23:30.757 --> 01:23:31.800
Thank you so much.

01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:34.928
(footsteps departing)

01:23:35.011 --> 01:23:36.304
(door opens)

01:23:40.266 --> 01:23:42.143
- MAN: Come on, right here.
- Mm-mmm.

01:23:43.144 --> 01:23:45.689
No. I'm waiting for somebody.

01:23:45.772 --> 01:23:47.190
It's clearly marked.

01:23:47.273 --> 01:23:49.150
JACK: I'm pretty sure
they were stolen,

01:23:49.234 --> 01:23:51.903
but I didn't want to ask.

01:23:52.570 --> 01:23:54.382
She asked me to sell them
for her as a favor...

01:23:54.406 --> 01:23:57.617
so, I said,
"Of course I will."

01:23:57.701 --> 01:23:58.743
As a favor?

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.663
You don't accept a cut?

01:24:01.746 --> 01:24:03.707
Well, a small one.

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:04.791
Very small.

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:06.251
(indistinct chatter)

01:24:06.334 --> 01:24:07.794
You know what?

01:24:12.382 --> 01:24:14.592
Oh, I got him. That's...

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:16.052
(door opens)

01:24:18.847 --> 01:24:22.559
Lee Israel? I'm Agent Solanas.
This is Agent Doyle.

01:24:22.642 --> 01:24:24.102
We're here to deliver a subpoena

01:24:24.185 --> 01:24:26.438
to appear before
a federal grand jury.

01:24:26.521 --> 01:24:29.566
Your appearance is scheduled
for two weeks from today.

01:24:29.649 --> 01:24:32.569
We've intercepted your employee,
Jack Hock.

01:24:32.652 --> 01:24:33.695
He's cooperating,

01:24:33.862 --> 01:24:36.239
<i>as are the dealers
you've done business with.</i>

01:24:36.322 --> 01:24:37.657
<i>SOLANAS: Mr. Hock requests</i>

01:24:37.741 --> 01:24:39.075
<i>that you do not try to reach him</i>

01:24:39.159 --> 01:24:42.078
<i>or telephone or harass him
in any way.</i>

01:24:43.329 --> 01:24:44.706
You are forbidden to destroy

01:24:44.789 --> 01:24:47.417
any evidence pertinent
to this case.

01:24:53.465 --> 01:24:54.465
(grunts)

01:24:58.762 --> 01:25:00.346
(panting)

01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:01.639
(grunts)

01:25:07.771 --> 01:25:09.189
(groans)

01:25:09.856 --> 01:25:10.857
LLOYD: Headache?

01:25:11.983 --> 01:25:12.984
Awful.

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:16.154
Can't say I blame you.

01:25:17.197 --> 01:25:19.449
Looking at this stuff,
it is pretty bad.

01:25:21.201 --> 01:25:24.454
We're probably looking
at some time behind bars.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:31.878
That said, these letters
are pretty incredible.

01:25:31.961 --> 01:25:34.214
I especially enjoyed
the Louise Brooks. (chuckles)

01:25:36.174 --> 01:25:37.884
Thank you.

01:25:40.011 --> 01:25:41.721
Look, if you want me
to represent you...

01:25:41.805 --> 01:25:43.115
there are a few things
you're going to

01:25:43.139 --> 01:25:44.579
have to do before
appearing in court.

01:25:45.266 --> 01:25:46.266
Like what?

01:25:46.351 --> 01:25:47.435
Clean up your act.

01:25:47.519 --> 01:25:50.063
First, you're getting a job.
Any kind of job.

01:25:50.146 --> 01:25:51.906
Second, you're enrolling
in community service

01:25:51.981 --> 01:25:53.817
to show just how
penitent you are.

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:56.069
What? What kind of service?

01:25:56.528 --> 01:25:57.529
Something with children.

01:25:57.821 --> 01:25:59.948
Ah, Jesus. No.

01:26:00.156 --> 01:26:02.784
Animals, then.
Sick people, whatever.

01:26:02.867 --> 01:26:06.204
You have to show that
you've turned over a new leaf.

01:26:08.748 --> 01:26:09.958
And you've got to go to AA.

01:26:18.049 --> 01:26:20.426
Can I ask you a question?

01:26:20.718 --> 01:26:23.012
Everyone I sold to...

01:26:25.932 --> 01:26:27.225
...do you think they all know?

01:26:30.019 --> 01:26:33.439
Yeah. They all probably know.

01:26:34.315 --> 01:26:36.609
But right now, that's
the least of your worries.

01:26:40.321 --> 01:26:42.866
(indistinct chatter)

01:26:46.494 --> 01:26:47.734
LLOYD:
She is seeking employment

01:26:47.787 --> 01:26:50.248
with Scholastic Books
as a copy editor

01:26:50.331 --> 01:26:51.624
and has already put in

01:26:51.708 --> 01:26:53.793
over 40 hours
of community service

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.337
at a cat shelter.

01:27:02.343 --> 01:27:04.053
Before I render my verdict,

01:27:04.137 --> 01:27:06.014
have you, in the last 24 hours,

01:27:06.097 --> 01:27:08.474
used drugs, pills, alcohol...

01:27:08.641 --> 01:27:10.119
anything that could
affect your ability

01:27:10.143 --> 01:27:12.270
to understand what's going on?

01:27:13.521 --> 01:27:14.564
Uh, no, ma'am.

01:27:14.898 --> 01:27:15.958
Have you anything additionally

01:27:15.982 --> 01:27:17.084
you'd like to say to the court

01:27:17.108 --> 01:27:18.318
before I offer your sentence?

01:27:19.444 --> 01:27:20.737
Yes.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:25.408
(clears throat)

01:27:27.869 --> 01:27:30.788
"I have been living in a state
of enormous guilt

01:27:30.872 --> 01:27:34.751
"and anxiety for many months."

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:37.045
Not so much because

01:27:37.170 --> 01:27:39.297
I felt like what I was
doing was wrong

01:27:39.422 --> 01:27:45.637
but because I was just always
afraid of being found out.

01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:49.682
I can't specifically say that
I regret any of my actions.

01:27:49.766 --> 01:27:50.934
LLOYD:
(clears throat) Lee.

01:27:52.602 --> 01:27:54.354
I don't.

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:57.732
(sniffles)

01:27:57.815 --> 01:27:58.900
I mean, in many ways,

01:27:58.983 --> 01:28:03.321
this has been
the best time of my life.

01:28:04.572 --> 01:28:05.740
(chuckles)

01:28:07.617 --> 01:28:11.829
I mean, it's the only time...

01:28:11.913 --> 01:28:16.793
recently, that I can remember
being proud of my work.

01:28:18.753 --> 01:28:21.631
But it wasn't really my work,
was it?

01:28:21.756 --> 01:28:22.799
I mean...

01:28:22.882 --> 01:28:27.011
if I had put in my work...

01:28:27.095 --> 01:28:32.600
then I would've been opening
myself up to criticism.

01:28:35.395 --> 01:28:40.650
And I'm too much
of a coward to do that.

01:28:45.947 --> 01:28:48.074
Then I lost my cat.

01:28:50.326 --> 01:28:53.246
She was probably
the only soul...

01:28:53.329 --> 01:28:55.790
that truly loved me,
maybe ever.

01:28:59.293 --> 01:29:01.421
And I lost my friend...

01:29:01.504 --> 01:29:04.340
who may have been
an idiot, but he...

01:29:04.424 --> 01:29:06.884
he tolerated me.

01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:10.638
And he was nice to have around.

01:29:11.639 --> 01:29:14.976
And I think I have
realized that I am...

01:29:17.729 --> 01:29:19.981
...not a real writer.

01:29:22.442 --> 01:29:23.985
And that...

01:29:25.153 --> 01:29:26.446
...I think, in the end, it...

01:29:27.447 --> 01:29:31.409
...I would say,
was not worth it.

01:29:33.745 --> 01:29:35.413
(softly)
I would say that.

01:29:36.956 --> 01:29:38.041
Uh...

01:29:38.291 --> 01:29:41.627
"I will accept the judgment
of the court as valid

01:29:41.836 --> 01:29:45.923
"and fulfill whatever sentence
I may receive...

01:29:46.007 --> 01:29:47.175
(sniffles)

01:29:47.258 --> 01:29:50.470
"...with full understanding
that I have earned...

01:29:52.555 --> 01:29:53.556
"...said punishment."

01:30:01.689 --> 01:30:03.691
Lee Israel,
the court sentences you

01:30:03.775 --> 01:30:05.068
to five years' probation

01:30:05.318 --> 01:30:07.528
plus six months' house arrest.

01:30:07.862 --> 01:30:09.655
You may only leave home to go

01:30:09.739 --> 01:30:11.532
to and from your place
of employment,

01:30:11.616 --> 01:30:12.950
your work in the community,

01:30:13.034 --> 01:30:15.411
and to
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:18.581
You are not to leave the state
or consort with felons,

01:30:18.664 --> 01:30:20.333
and you are to pay restitution

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:23.002
to your victims
within your means.

01:30:23.086 --> 01:30:25.213
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:27.380
(Lloyd sighs)

01:30:33.304 --> 01:30:35.348
LLOYD: This is a good thing.

01:30:36.307 --> 01:30:38.226
Very fair.

01:30:38.309 --> 01:30:40.228
Mmm. (sniffles)

01:30:40.311 --> 01:30:41.479
Good.

01:30:41.562 --> 01:30:42.980
LLOYD: Yeah.

01:30:44.232 --> 01:30:45.525
(exhales)

01:30:47.819 --> 01:30:49.195
Mm-mmm.

01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:54.200
(door opening)

01:31:40.246 --> 01:31:41.539

(indistinct chatter)

01:32:43.935 --> 01:32:45.561
(no audible dialogue)

01:32:57.949 --> 01:32:59.116
(glass clinking)

01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:09.669
(door closes)

01:33:10.795 --> 01:33:13.089
LEE: Thanks for coming.

01:33:13.172 --> 01:33:15.800
It was quite inconvenient.

01:33:15.883 --> 01:33:17.043
I moved some meetings around.

01:33:20.054 --> 01:33:21.973
Can I get you a drink?
I'm buying.

01:33:22.139 --> 01:33:23.474
(groans)

01:33:23.557 --> 01:33:25.268
Not today.

01:33:25.351 --> 01:33:30.398
My new meds make gin
taste like mouthwash.

01:33:30.481 --> 01:33:32.525
Takes the fun out of it.

01:33:35.278 --> 01:33:37.655
I guess you cut a deal?

01:33:38.072 --> 01:33:39.949
Ratting on me worked out?

01:33:40.032 --> 01:33:42.410
(clicks tongue)
Three years' probation.

01:33:42.493 --> 01:33:43.911
At least you're out and about.

01:33:43.995 --> 01:33:45.037
So are you.

01:33:45.121 --> 01:33:48.416
No. I'm at an AA meeting
on Tenth Street right now.

01:33:48.499 --> 01:33:50.501
(Jack laughs)

01:33:50.584 --> 01:33:53.129
Criminals at large.

01:33:53.212 --> 01:33:55.756
I can't imagine
what was so important

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.509
that Lee Israel
swallowed her pride

01:33:58.592 --> 01:34:01.220
and asked to meet me,
so spit it out.

01:34:04.682 --> 01:34:07.059
I've been thinking
about writing a new book.

01:34:07.143 --> 01:34:10.313
About what happened, and...

01:34:10.396 --> 01:34:13.482
what I did, and...

01:34:13.566 --> 01:34:15.735
about you, if you'll let me.

01:34:15.818 --> 01:34:17.445
Like hell I will.

01:34:17.528 --> 01:34:18.904
What will my boyfriend say

01:34:18.988 --> 01:34:21.657
if he heard about
my shadier dealings?

01:34:21.824 --> 01:34:23.993
I doubt our crimes even rank

01:34:24.076 --> 01:34:26.704
on your top ten
of shady dealings.

01:34:26.787 --> 01:34:28.581
Fair enough.

01:34:28.664 --> 01:34:30.344
But I don't want a book
out there about me.

01:34:30.416 --> 01:34:32.835
I'm a very private person.

01:34:34.337 --> 01:34:38.382
I need to do something,
and I need to write again.

01:34:38.549 --> 01:34:39.884
Mmm.

01:34:39.967 --> 01:34:43.012
What about Fanny... Price?

01:34:43.179 --> 01:34:45.848
God damn. It's Brice.

01:34:47.725 --> 01:34:50.478
As terrifying as it sounds, I...

01:34:50.561 --> 01:34:53.272
I think I'm supposed
to be writing about us.

01:34:55.983 --> 01:34:57.693
I'm still mad at you, you know.

01:34:57.777 --> 01:34:59.779
You treated me like shit.

01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:02.498
I don't think you're
a very nice person, Lee.

01:35:03.783 --> 01:35:04.992
I would agree with you.

01:35:08.245 --> 01:35:10.831
I suppose you might
be mad at me as well.

01:35:11.165 --> 01:35:14.627
Well, I mean, if you didn't look
so decrepit, I might be.

01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:15.870
JACK:
(chuckles) Yeah, well...

01:35:16.003 --> 01:35:19.131
it was gonna catch
up to me eventually.

01:35:20.925 --> 01:35:23.135
You did fuck your way
through Manhattan, I mean...

01:35:23.511 --> 01:35:24.970
(laughs)

01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:28.057
I'd like that on my tombstone.

01:35:28.224 --> 01:35:31.435
(both laughing)

01:35:41.487 --> 01:35:43.072
Could you make me 29?

01:35:44.782 --> 01:35:46.242
With perfect skin.

01:35:46.325 --> 01:35:48.744
Don't make me sound stupid. Hmm?

01:35:58.212 --> 01:36:00.172
Thank you.

01:36:05.886 --> 01:36:07.304
(sighs)

01:36:07.388 --> 01:36:09.181
I'm late for a board meeting.

01:36:10.182 --> 01:36:12.143

- What?

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:26.490
I had such an urge
to trip you just then.

01:36:26.615 --> 01:36:27.616
(laughs)

01:36:28.492 --> 01:36:29.827
Wow.

01:38:47.965 --> 01:38:49.758
