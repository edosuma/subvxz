WEBVTT

00:00.442 --> 00:02.151
Liz, I've helped a lot of women

00:02.220 --> 00:03.703
who are struggling to conceive.

00:03.706 --> 00:06.557
I know how trying the process can be,

00:06.559 --> 00:09.060
because I've been through it myself.

00:09.062 --> 00:10.945
Carol, they're towing your car!

00:10.947 --> 00:12.646
Damn it.
My kids are in there.

00:12.648 --> 00:13.964
No! How?

00:13.966 --> 00:16.067
I came all the way up to Westchester

00:16.068 --> 00:17.168
just to avoid you.

00:17.170 --> 00:19.653
This is Westchester?
I am lost.

00:19.655 --> 00:21.739
Now, fertility shots...

00:21.741 --> 00:24.025
That's a euphemism, right?

00:24.027 --> 00:25.960
No, my husband and I
are trying to conceive.

00:25.962 --> 00:27.444
I'm gonna write you a prescription

00:27.446 --> 00:29.279
for progesterone injections.

00:29.281 --> 00:30.781
That's a female hormone.

00:30.783 --> 00:32.917
Now, I know what you're
thinking, and the answer is no.

00:32.919 --> 00:35.419
If a man takes it,
he won't grow breasts,

00:35.421 --> 00:37.254
although that would be awesome.

00:37.256 --> 00:39.340
No money for the whorehouse?
That's fine.

00:39.342 --> 00:41.291
I'll just look down
while hiding my crotch

00:41.293 --> 00:42.593
with an oriental fan.

00:42.595 --> 00:43.794
Injections?

00:43.796 --> 00:47.464
"Injections"?
Yeah, injections.

00:47.466 --> 00:50.067
Are you Dr. Leo Spaceman?

00:50.069 --> 00:51.602
Come with us to Washington.

00:51.604 --> 00:52.686
You've just been named

00:52.688 --> 00:54.021
surgeon general of the United States.

00:54.023 --> 00:55.806
Hey, that's a series wrap

00:55.808 --> 00:57.775
on Leo Spaceman, suckers.

00:57.777 --> 00:59.026
Bye.

30 ROCK
S07 Ep09 - Game Over

01:14.358 --> 01:18.031
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

01:22.718 --> 01:24.168
Are you doping?

01:24.170 --> 01:26.470
Liz Lemon, that stuff
will shrink your testicles,

01:26.472 --> 01:28.889
but there are bad side effects as well.

01:28.891 --> 01:30.674
No, Tracy. Not that
it's any of your business,

01:30.676 --> 01:32.610
but I am starting fertility treatments.

01:32.612 --> 01:33.811
Now, I'm not a woman,

01:33.813 --> 01:35.863
so of course I can say whatever I want.

01:35.865 --> 01:38.115
This seems really weird and unnatural.

01:38.117 --> 01:41.068
"Side effects include mood
swings, increased irritability,

01:41.070 --> 01:43.370
and swelling
of one or more boobs."

01:43.372 --> 01:44.855
- Can I help you with something?
- Yeah.

01:44.857 --> 01:47.357
I'm about to start shooting
my new Harriet tubman movie,

01:47.359 --> 01:49.410
and I got octavia Spencer
to play the lead...

01:49.412 --> 01:50.628
Harriet something.

01:50.630 --> 01:52.546
You know, I once played
Frederick douglass

01:52.548 --> 01:53.914
in a one-woman show

01:53.916 --> 01:55.716
that the university of Maryland
<i>Diamondback</i> called

01:55.718 --> 01:57.301
"too confusing
to be offensive."

01:57.303 --> 01:59.253
Point is, I won't be at rehearsal

01:59.255 --> 02:01.255
at all this week.
No, Tracy.

02:01.257 --> 02:02.840
Exactly.
No Tracy.

02:02.842 --> 02:04.892
Thanks for being so understanding.

02:10.681 --> 02:12.733
- Good morning, Jack.
- Hank.

02:12.735 --> 02:14.819
I was so sorry to hear
about your mother.

02:14.821 --> 02:15.886
Thank you, Hank.

02:15.888 --> 02:17.188
I remember my own mother's passing.

02:17.190 --> 02:18.355
She wanted to be cremated,

02:18.357 --> 02:20.191
and she ended up dying in a fire.

02:20.193 --> 02:21.992
Such a considerate woman.

02:21.994 --> 02:23.277
Well, on a brighter note,

02:23.279 --> 02:24.945
I should wish you a Happy Birthday.

02:24.947 --> 02:26.897
No, no.
It's not my birthday yet.

02:26.899 --> 02:30.584
And it only counts when
it's actually on your birthday.

02:30.586 --> 02:32.203
I have very strict birthday rules.

02:32.205 --> 02:37.091
One... birthday boy always sleeps
in the largest tiger cage.

02:37.093 --> 02:40.127
Some of the rules may be
specific to my time in Vietnam.

02:40.129 --> 02:42.129
Now, Jack, as you know,

02:42.131 --> 02:44.265
the Kabletown board
is meeting this Friday.

02:44.267 --> 02:46.917
I promised my wife I'd step aside

02:46.919 --> 02:48.385
when I turned 70,

02:48.387 --> 02:51.689
but it's very important to me
that control of Kabletown

02:51.691 --> 02:53.924
stays in the Hooper family.

02:53.926 --> 02:57.027
But my kids are creative types.

02:57.029 --> 02:59.146
Yes, I understand
that Hank Jr. is writing

02:59.148 --> 03:00.814
a children's book about a giraffe

03:00.816 --> 03:02.599
who learns
he doesn't have to work hard.

03:02.601 --> 03:04.985
But they say sometimes
it skips a generation.

03:04.987 --> 03:06.570
I think you know my granddaughter.

03:06.572 --> 03:08.622
Sir, Kaylie is only 15.

03:08.624 --> 03:10.791
Yeah, but when she gets out
of college, she'll be 21.

03:10.793 --> 03:13.244
That's the same age I was
when I started Kabletown,

03:13.246 --> 03:15.379
got married,
and had my first white child.

03:15.381 --> 03:17.748
Hank, please think
about your other options.

03:17.750 --> 03:21.752
Jack, you've done
an excellent job with NBC.

03:21.754 --> 03:23.170
I admit I was skeptical

03:23.172 --> 03:25.089
when I first saw your fall schedule.

03:25.091 --> 03:27.124
"What? Is this guy
trying to tank the company?"

03:27.126 --> 03:29.393
But, boy, you proved me wrong.

03:29.395 --> 03:33.514
<i>Celebrity homonym</i> is
the number-one show in America.

03:33.516 --> 03:35.482
The word is "racket."

03:35.484 --> 03:38.185
Okay, "racket," like a tennis racket.

03:38.187 --> 03:39.187
Sorry.
It's the other one.

03:39.188 --> 03:41.689
Again?
You know what, pal?

03:41.691 --> 03:43.492
Why don't you come over here
and tell me that?

03:44.277 --> 03:45.776
I am grateful.

03:45.778 --> 03:47.361
That's why I came up with a solution

03:47.363 --> 03:48.696
that will make everyone happy.

03:48.698 --> 03:53.083
Until Kaylie graduates,
you'll be her assistant CEO.

03:53.085 --> 03:54.201
"Assistant"?

03:54.203 --> 03:55.485
CEO.

03:55.487 --> 03:57.788
She'll be on the board,
learning the ropes,

03:57.790 --> 03:59.924
and you'll keep her chair warm.

03:59.926 --> 04:03.294
It'll work great,
just like Conan and Jay.

04:07.966 --> 04:10.667
Have you ever
updated your flash player?

04:10.669 --> 04:12.586
It is so sad.

04:12.588 --> 04:15.005
What happens
to version 11.4?

04:15.007 --> 04:16.807
- What now?
- I'm taking hormone shots

04:16.809 --> 04:18.392
to have a baby, you son of a bitch!

04:18.394 --> 04:20.611
A beautiful little baby.

04:20.613 --> 04:23.731
Being a woman is the worst.

04:24.984 --> 04:26.850
Lemon, Hank Hooper just told me

04:26.852 --> 04:28.786
I will never be CEO of Kabletown,

04:28.788 --> 04:30.454
but he doesn't know
about my secret weapon...

04:30.456 --> 04:32.122
My mother's death.

04:32.124 --> 04:33.690
- Wait. So we're both crazy?
- No.

04:33.692 --> 04:35.993
I've spent my life trying
to win my mother's approval,

04:35.995 --> 04:37.461
but she never gave it to me,

04:37.463 --> 04:38.996
which means I can't ever stop trying,

04:38.998 --> 04:41.031
even when faced
with an impossible task,

04:41.033 --> 04:43.500
like making Hank choose me
over his own granddaughter.

04:43.502 --> 04:45.753
- How much time do you have?
- Three days.

04:45.755 --> 04:47.221
It's exactly the kind of challenge

04:47.223 --> 04:48.973
my mother's anti-love
prepared me for.

04:48.975 --> 04:51.041
I'll make you proud of me yet, Colleen!

04:51.043 --> 04:52.542
It'll either be my masterpiece,

04:52.544 --> 04:53.861
or I will resign in shame.

04:53.863 --> 04:55.663
Just like poor Nixon.

04:55.665 --> 04:59.683
He did good things in China.

05:01.403 --> 05:02.552
Hey.

05:02.554 --> 05:04.438
Octavia, excellent, you're black.

05:04.440 --> 05:05.689
Now, in this scene,

05:05.691 --> 05:07.358
you're gonna enter through the door.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.609
I don't think so.

05:08.611 --> 05:09.994
I'm gonna walk in from over here.

05:09.996 --> 05:11.612
But the door.

05:11.614 --> 05:13.063
Well, you're just gonna have
to rewrite the script

05:13.065 --> 05:15.199
and explain how my character
can go through walls.

05:15.201 --> 05:18.669
Also, I want to wear a t-shirt,
promote my website.

05:18.671 --> 05:20.871
But slaves
didn't wear t-shirts.

05:20.873 --> 05:23.173
That sounds
like a Tracy problem, Tracy.

05:23.175 --> 05:24.458
I'm done for the day.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.876
I got to go home and feed my eels.

05:25.878 --> 05:27.878
They're not electric,
but I have a plan.

05:27.880 --> 05:32.016
Mizz, Dotgov, let's roll.

05:35.804 --> 05:39.473
Len, I'm in the endgame here
with this Kabletown situation.

05:39.475 --> 05:42.426
Do you have anything on Kaylie for me?

05:42.428 --> 05:43.861
Well, Mr. Donaghy,
you asked me

05:43.863 --> 05:46.363
to pull out all the stops on
this, so I went deep undercover,

05:46.365 --> 05:48.315
and I applied for a job
as a drama teacher

05:48.317 --> 05:49.317
at Kaylie's school.

05:49.318 --> 05:50.701
Hi, I'm Ms. Foster,

05:50.703 --> 05:52.436
but, please, call me Jan.

05:52.438 --> 05:55.656
Boy, Jay-Z and Shakespeare
have nothing in common.

05:55.658 --> 05:59.410
Or do they?

05:59.412 --> 06:02.713
Fyi... Jan Foster is currently
in a "lesbian relationship"

06:02.715 --> 06:04.614
with Ms. Siegal
from the math department.

06:04.616 --> 06:06.333
Okay, I don't know
why you had to be a woman.

06:06.335 --> 06:07.451
Let me worry about that.

06:07.453 --> 06:09.803
The point is Jan took these pictures

06:09.805 --> 06:11.305
this morning outside school.

06:11.307 --> 06:14.341
She thinks you'll be
very interested in them.

06:17.395 --> 06:18.679
Banks.

06:18.681 --> 06:21.815
Pedal faster, fatties.

06:21.817 --> 06:24.852
God, I love how much you disgust me.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.607
Class dismissed.

06:30.609 --> 06:32.642
Really, banks?
Spin class?

06:32.644 --> 06:34.361
Isn't that a bit of a gay cliche?

06:34.363 --> 06:35.579
You're the gay one.

06:35.581 --> 06:37.815
Wanting to be with a woman...
How gay is that?

06:37.817 --> 06:39.333
You win sex against a man,

06:39.335 --> 06:40.617
that's as straight as it gets.

06:40.619 --> 06:42.369
You were good...
One of the best.

06:42.371 --> 06:43.587
But look at you now.

06:43.589 --> 06:45.956
Hitching your wagon
to a 15-year-old girl?

06:45.958 --> 06:48.976
Look, I understand
why Kaylie would seek you out.

06:48.978 --> 06:50.260
No one knows me better.

06:50.262 --> 06:52.946
But you also know
that Jack Donaghy always wins.

06:52.948 --> 06:55.165
Or have you forgotten
the time we played <i>battleship?</i> B

06:55.167 --> 06:56.917
Remember A-8?

06:56.919 --> 07:00.003
You peeked.

07:00.005 --> 07:01.054
Why are you here, Jack?

07:01.056 --> 07:02.356
To propose something,

07:02.358 --> 07:04.341
something no one would ever expect...

07:04.343 --> 07:05.675
An alliance.

07:05.677 --> 07:07.060
Think about it.

07:07.062 --> 07:08.695
How much time and energy have we wasted

07:08.697 --> 07:12.232
with our sparring and our
gravel-voiced double entendres?

07:12.234 --> 07:13.400
An assload.

07:13.402 --> 07:14.651
If we joined forces,

07:14.653 --> 07:16.904
we could become
the greatest business power duo

07:16.906 --> 07:19.823
since Gregory Linens
teamed up with Thomas n'things.

07:19.825 --> 07:22.859
And whatever Kaylie's offering,
I'll double it.

07:24.796 --> 07:27.397
I'll tell you
what Kaylie's offering me...

07:27.399 --> 07:29.099
100 grand to keep my mouth shut.

07:29.101 --> 07:30.551
Keep your mouth shut?
What do you mean?

07:30.553 --> 07:33.837
I know certain things, Jack,
about Kaylie's father...

07:33.839 --> 07:36.290
Certain super-gay things.

07:36.292 --> 07:37.641
Hank's son is gay?

07:37.643 --> 07:39.009
How gay, banks,

07:39.011 --> 07:41.061
on a scale from bear hunting
to hunting bears?

07:41.063 --> 07:44.014
Gay enough that Kaylie's parents
have never actually had

07:44.016 --> 07:45.766
heterosexual intercourse.

07:45.768 --> 07:47.351
Word is Kaylie's real father
is the Poole boy.

07:47.353 --> 07:48.368
Do you know him...

07:48.370 --> 07:49.719
Frederick Poole's grandson Trevor?

07:49.721 --> 07:50.720
Very handsome, horrible personality...

07:50.722 --> 07:52.139
I'm totally in love with him.

07:52.141 --> 07:55.192
But if Kaylie isn't really
Hank's granddaughter...

07:55.194 --> 07:56.627
Then she isn't actually family.

07:56.629 --> 07:57.845
And once she's out of the picture,

07:57.847 --> 07:59.346
you're the only choice
to take over Kabletown.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.781
And you're gonna take me with you.

08:00.783 --> 08:03.617
But how do we prove
Kaylie's not a Hooper?

08:03.619 --> 08:04.701
All we need is DNA.

08:04.703 --> 08:06.787
I've got a ton of her dad's.

08:06.789 --> 08:10.591
So we just need Kaylie's.

08:22.807 --> 08:24.324
Hi, Bev.
It's Liz.

08:24.326 --> 08:25.826
Liz!

08:25.828 --> 08:27.561
Yeah, definitely, don't give me
your last name,

08:27.563 --> 08:29.129
because I only deal
with one person a year,

08:29.131 --> 08:30.531
so I know exactly who you are.

08:30.533 --> 08:31.949
It's Elizabeth Lemon.

08:31.951 --> 08:34.368
I've been on the agency's list
for a few years now.

08:34.370 --> 08:36.537
I wanted to see if you got my letter

08:36.539 --> 08:37.788
updating my marital status.

08:37.789 --> 08:39.239
Yes.
Congratulations.

08:39.241 --> 08:41.592
You've moved from
the "well-meaning lesbian" pile

08:41.594 --> 08:43.743
to "found a man,
comma, living a lie."

08:43.745 --> 08:46.547
That brings your wait time
down to only four years.

08:46.549 --> 08:47.948
Four years?

08:47.950 --> 08:50.384
So I'll be 46 by the time I get a baby?

08:50.386 --> 08:52.052
Unless you'd like
to adopt an older child.

08:52.054 --> 08:53.887
I can give you
a six-year-old yesterday.

08:53.889 --> 08:55.355
Pick a color.

08:55.357 --> 08:57.975
I just always pictured
myself getting a newborn.

08:57.977 --> 08:59.226
And I always pictured myself

08:59.228 --> 09:01.278
getting double-teamed
by two the rocks.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.430
But sometimes we have
to make compromises.

09:03.432 --> 09:04.948
Let me know if you change your mind.

09:11.573 --> 09:14.792
Jack, how old is too old
for a woman to have a baby?

09:14.794 --> 09:15.959
19.

09:15.961 --> 09:17.161
Look, I have three options

09:17.163 --> 09:18.495
if I still want to start a family.

09:18.497 --> 09:20.130
There's the old-fashioned way,

09:20.132 --> 09:21.665
but these hormone treatments
are the worst.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.250
And even if they work, at my age,

09:23.252 --> 09:25.452
the kid might just come out
a ball of fingers.

09:25.454 --> 09:28.422
Steve Forbes was born
a ball of fingers.

09:28.424 --> 09:30.674
He had the best surgeons money can buy,

09:30.676 --> 09:32.476
but you can still tell.

09:32.478 --> 09:35.095
So option two is adopting a baby,

09:35.097 --> 09:36.597
but I have to wait four more years.

09:36.599 --> 09:37.964
I'll be almost 70

09:37.966 --> 09:40.067
when she graduates from college,

09:40.069 --> 09:42.603
which just leaves option three...
Adopting an older kid,

09:42.605 --> 09:44.321
but I don't think I can handle that.

09:44.323 --> 09:45.639
Really?
Wouldn't that be easier

09:45.641 --> 09:47.241
than taking care of an infant?

09:47.243 --> 09:48.808
No. With a baby, you know
what you're getting.

09:48.810 --> 09:50.527
With an older kid, who knows?

09:50.529 --> 09:53.146
For every orphan Annie, there's
a 30-year-old Russian dwarf

09:53.148 --> 09:54.698
who's just pretending to be a child,

09:54.700 --> 09:56.533
according to a movie
that I watched part of.

09:56.535 --> 09:58.368
We are both at a crossroads, Lemon.

09:58.370 --> 10:00.954
I have chosen my path.
It's time you do the same.

10:00.956 --> 10:03.841
Hello, partner.

10:03.843 --> 10:05.158
What's happening here?

10:05.160 --> 10:06.660
What's happening to your left blob?

10:06.662 --> 10:08.962
- It's the hormones.
- Lemon, thanks to banks,

10:08.964 --> 10:10.430
I have reason to believe that Kaylie

10:10.432 --> 10:11.998
is not her father's daughter.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.667
The reason
being a week-long party

10:13.669 --> 10:15.319
in Stephen sondheim's sex dungeon.

10:15.321 --> 10:17.170
The workmanship down there
is exquisite,

10:17.172 --> 10:18.505
but it took forever.

10:18.507 --> 10:19.806
Renovations in New York.

10:19.808 --> 10:21.508
The point is, when Hank finds out

10:21.510 --> 10:23.009
that Kaylie's not family...

10:23.011 --> 10:25.028
My God, are you planning
on telling Hank

10:25.030 --> 10:26.647
just so you can get a promotion?

10:26.649 --> 10:28.715
Not just a promotion.
I'll be CEO.

10:28.717 --> 10:30.517
And I'll be NBC's head of publicity.

10:30.519 --> 10:32.536
You'll never see me again.
I'll be on a beach somewhere.

10:32.538 --> 10:33.754
I know this is important to you,

10:33.756 --> 10:35.489
but you are off the rails, Jack.

10:35.491 --> 10:36.707
Thanks for the compliment, Lemon.

10:36.709 --> 10:38.992
Train travel's for hoboes.

10:38.994 --> 10:40.661
What you're doing makes no sense.

10:40.663 --> 10:42.329
You're teaming up with Devin?

10:42.331 --> 10:43.830
Hey, listen, I've changed, Lemon.

10:43.832 --> 10:45.716
The only backstabbing I do now is...

10:45.718 --> 10:47.217
Well, you know.

10:47.219 --> 10:49.720
Every time I think we're done
with that, we find another one.

10:49.722 --> 10:51.505
You're trying to tear apart a family.

10:51.507 --> 10:53.373
You're in a blood feud
with a teenage girl.

10:53.375 --> 10:56.260
All she wants to do is talk
about boys and text on her phone

10:56.262 --> 10:58.061
and, if she's like me, sit in a closet

10:58.063 --> 11:00.147
with a flashlight
and memorize airport codes.

11:00.149 --> 11:02.182
Her phone.
Lemon, you're a genius.

11:02.184 --> 11:04.217
That's how we get Kaylie's DNA.

11:04.219 --> 11:06.403
Teenage girls can't stop looking
at their phones.

11:06.405 --> 11:08.355
It's like me with paintings of cannons.

11:08.357 --> 11:11.308
Yes, her DNA's
all over that phone, of course.

11:11.310 --> 11:13.694
But how can we get close enough
to steal it?

11:13.696 --> 11:15.495
We need a teenage girl.

11:15.497 --> 11:16.663
Or someone who thinks like one.

11:16.665 --> 11:18.532
Damn it.
Why do I keep helping you?

11:18.534 --> 11:20.400
I'll just do anything for approval.

11:20.402 --> 11:21.735
I would have been a Nazi.

11:21.737 --> 11:25.255
Who do we know who's immature
and vicious enough to...

11:25.257 --> 11:28.425
Let's destroy her.

11:28.427 --> 11:31.461
Now, what can I do
for you two gentlemen?

11:36.584 --> 11:38.585
Hello, Mr. Director.

11:38.587 --> 11:39.937
- So how's the movie going?
- Terrible.

11:39.939 --> 11:42.439
Octavia won't do anything
I tell her to do.

11:42.441 --> 11:43.757
She left early.

11:43.759 --> 11:45.442
She's completely unprofessional.

11:45.444 --> 11:46.476
I don't know, Tray.

11:46.478 --> 11:48.779
Sound like she acting like you.

11:48.781 --> 11:50.280
But I'm impossible to deal with.

11:50.282 --> 11:53.433
No one has ever been able
to rein in my hilarious antics.

11:53.435 --> 11:56.536
Liz Lemon does it every day
and looks great doing it.

11:56.538 --> 11:58.989
Okay.
So I should just act like her.

11:58.991 --> 12:01.358
W.W.R.X.W.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.411
What would Liz Lemon do?

12:06.247 --> 12:07.247
Kaylie Hooper.

12:07.249 --> 12:08.749
To what do I owe the pleasure?

12:08.751 --> 12:12.336
Jack, pleasure's the name
of a pony I hate.

12:12.338 --> 12:15.255
This is business.

12:15.257 --> 12:18.308
So I just happened to bump
into Jenna Maroney

12:18.310 --> 12:20.093
at lunch this afternoon.

12:20.095 --> 12:21.461
What are the chances?

12:21.463 --> 12:23.096
What did you do to her, Hooper?

12:23.098 --> 12:24.581
Her brain's like silly putty,

12:24.583 --> 12:27.434
a toy I am too old for.

12:27.436 --> 12:29.770
Kaylie Hooper.

12:29.772 --> 12:31.938
O.M.G.
It's Jenna.

12:31.940 --> 12:34.324
You're wearing that belt
as a joke, right?

12:34.326 --> 12:36.493
Of course I am.

12:36.495 --> 12:38.662
Where did you get your belt?
You're so cool.

12:38.664 --> 12:40.030
Jack is trying to destroy you

12:40.032 --> 12:43.083
and wants me to steal your phone.

12:44.252 --> 12:46.253
Yeah, great plan, Jack.

12:46.255 --> 12:49.172
Kaylie, you look so gorgeous today.

12:49.174 --> 12:51.508
I'm wearing a headband because you are.

12:51.510 --> 12:52.793
Pathetic.

12:52.795 --> 12:55.796
What did you think you were
gonna do... blackmail me?

12:55.798 --> 12:57.597
Please, I don't keep anything
on my phone anymore.

12:57.599 --> 13:00.467
I use gadzorp.

13:00.469 --> 13:01.668
What on Earth is that?

13:01.670 --> 13:03.854
You're so old
and out of touch, Donaghy.

13:03.856 --> 13:08.341
I might as well be looking
at Justin Timberlake.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.379
I quit, cows.
Tell your husbands I tried.

13:35.381 --> 13:38.215
How'd you get these DNA results
back so fast?

13:38.217 --> 13:39.917
I happen to have
some very powerful friends

13:39.919 --> 13:41.218
at <i>the Maury Povich show.</i>

13:41.220 --> 13:42.886
Kaylie's not Hank's granddaughter.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.689
I knew it.

13:45.691 --> 13:48.576
Would you like to...

13:48.578 --> 13:49.994
Do the honors?

13:52.782 --> 13:55.082
Look how far we've come, Jack.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.901
From enemies to partners to who knows.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.587
Come on, let's get
a couple of wines in you

13:59.589 --> 14:02.623
and just start wrestling.

14:04.409 --> 14:07.344
Yeah, the whole cabin vibe
wasn't working for me.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.213
And this movie cannot take place
in Maryland

14:09.215 --> 14:11.415
because of my ongoing feud
with Cal ripken.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.183
Blargh.
I'm Liz Lemon.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.352
I'm in charge!
Nerds!

14:15.354 --> 14:17.137
I want to have a baby.

14:17.139 --> 14:20.024
My boyfriend is a pilot or something.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.358
Sandwiches.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.194
So you want to be the crazy one.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.231
Nuh.
I'll show you crazy.

14:29.284 --> 14:33.404
I'm a Jedi.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.440
I'm not coming to work tomorrow.

14:40.161 --> 14:42.379
Gentlemen...
Actually, Jack,

14:42.381 --> 14:45.749
I've decided to continue living
as Jan Foster.

14:45.751 --> 14:48.452
It's just in all these years
as a P.I.,

14:48.454 --> 14:52.173
I think my greatest disguise
was len wazniak.

14:52.208 --> 14:55.254
Tomorrow, the sun rises on
a new day on Kabletown,

14:55.280 --> 14:58.206
for America and for all of us.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.255
To victory.

15:02.463 --> 15:05.048
Kaylie, how do I not seen you to join
us?

15:05.168 --> 15:07.049
I know what's past your bad time.

15:07.137 --> 15:09.518
This party's lame. Let's go Kaylie.

15:09.521 --> 15:11.630
Devin? What are you doing here?

15:12.475 --> 15:13.475
And Mr. Foster?

15:13.489 --> 15:14.489
Hi honey!

15:15.160 --> 15:17.093
It's 20% of your midterm grade.

15:17.095 --> 15:18.795
I don't understand.

15:18.797 --> 15:20.463
Well, let me explain.

15:20.465 --> 15:22.665
Banks is on my side,

15:22.667 --> 15:25.802
and Ms. Foster
is a private investigator

15:25.804 --> 15:27.670
- I hired to follow you.
<i>- Was</i> a private investigator,

15:27.672 --> 15:29.355
<i>is</i> a drama teacher,

15:29.357 --> 15:31.024
and, as of last night,

15:31.026 --> 15:32.842
engaged to Ms. Siegal.

15:32.844 --> 15:34.844
So I know Hank Jr.
Isn't your father.

15:34.846 --> 15:37.447
And now so does...

15:37.449 --> 15:39.816
Your pop-pop.

15:39.818 --> 15:42.285
Game over, Kaylie.

15:45.540 --> 15:47.991
"Game over, Kaylie."

15:49.828 --> 15:51.494
This was too easy, Jack.

15:51.496 --> 15:52.545
Banks, what are you doing?

15:52.547 --> 15:54.631
FYI Kaylie is my best friend,

15:54.633 --> 15:56.166
so I sit next to her at the movies.

15:56.168 --> 15:57.467
Why can't she just sit in the middle?

15:57.469 --> 15:59.752
Jack...

15:59.754 --> 16:01.588
Sweet, sweet Jack.

16:01.590 --> 16:03.006
You wanted this so badly,

16:03.008 --> 16:05.391
you were willing to believe anything...

16:05.393 --> 16:07.143
That Devin would team up with you,

16:07.145 --> 16:08.711
that I wouldn't notice miss Foster

16:08.713 --> 16:11.514
sit on her testicles the other day,

16:11.516 --> 16:12.715
that my father is gay.

16:12.717 --> 16:15.351
I am Hank Hooper's granddaughter, Jack.

16:15.353 --> 16:17.237
But what about the DNA, the glass?

16:17.239 --> 16:20.273
You mean the glass I stole
from Jenna's dressing room?

16:27.564 --> 16:29.415
That was Jenna's DNA, Jack.

16:29.417 --> 16:32.568
So Jenna is an Ashkenazi Jew
with an extra "Y" chromosome?

16:32.570 --> 16:34.370
- What's that, now?
- It was so simple.

16:34.372 --> 16:35.905
And when you made your move with Jenna,

16:35.907 --> 16:37.907
all I had to do
was see straight through it,

16:37.909 --> 16:39.676
come back here, and plant that glass.

16:39.678 --> 16:41.594
You got the DNA results
you were hoping for

16:41.596 --> 16:44.547
and sent them
straight to pop-pop.

16:44.549 --> 16:46.099
This is why everyone hates you, Jack.

16:46.101 --> 16:48.218
We were all talking
about it before at the mall.

16:48.220 --> 16:50.687
How do you think old
Hank Hooper's gonna take that...

16:50.689 --> 16:53.556
You attempting to destroy his family?

16:53.558 --> 16:56.592
There's nothing pop-pop
cares more about than family.

16:56.594 --> 16:58.528
God, what have I done?

16:58.530 --> 17:00.196
Goodbye, Jack.

17:00.198 --> 17:01.531
See you never.

17:01.533 --> 17:04.450
Yeah, Jack.
See you never.

17:04.452 --> 17:07.487
Last word.

17:09.455 --> 17:13.626
Yes, I suppose that's one way
this could have played out.

17:13.627 --> 17:15.795
But there are other possibilities.

17:15.797 --> 17:18.798
Hypothetically, what if
I never trusted banks at all?

17:18.800 --> 17:22.050
What if I knew len would be
the worst mole ever?

17:22.053 --> 17:23.636
I'll tell him you said that.

17:23.637 --> 17:26.472
And what if I knew
the DNA gambit was bait

17:26.473 --> 17:28.725
and I never sent in
those test results at all?

17:28.727 --> 17:30.310
Well, that's impossible.

17:30.312 --> 17:33.346
I mailed them myself.
Did you?

17:37.935 --> 17:39.903
Okay.

17:39.905 --> 17:41.771
So you didn't do anything at all.

17:41.773 --> 17:43.072
Well, that's idiotic.

17:43.074 --> 17:44.941
Kabletown board is meeting tomorrow,

17:44.943 --> 17:47.577
and you've done nothing
to change pop-pop's mind.

17:47.579 --> 17:49.245
You just wasted a whole week.

17:49.247 --> 17:50.479
Not quite, Kaylie,

17:50.481 --> 17:53.499
because I did send something to Hank...

17:56.653 --> 17:58.254
A birthday card.

17:58.256 --> 18:00.123
- My God. No.
- Yes.

18:00.125 --> 18:01.758
You see, there is one thing

18:01.760 --> 18:04.961
Hank cares about as much as family...

18:04.963 --> 18:06.596
Birthdays.

18:06.598 --> 18:09.182
So what did you send him, Kaylie?

18:09.184 --> 18:10.883
I'm not the one who wasted a week.

18:10.885 --> 18:12.101
While I distracted you,

18:12.103 --> 18:14.637
you forgot
Pop-Pop's 70th birthday.

18:15.941 --> 18:17.173
Midnight.

18:17.175 --> 18:18.507
You missed it.

18:18.509 --> 18:19.943
And how do you think

18:19.945 --> 18:21.778
old Hank Hooper's
gonna take that, Kaylie?

18:33.325 --> 18:35.359
Wonderful.

18:38.045 --> 18:41.331
You sent him something, right, Kaylie?

18:41.333 --> 18:42.665
Kaylie?

18:42.667 --> 18:44.801
I lost.

18:44.803 --> 18:48.554
After college, I'm gonna have
to go into publishing and...

18:48.556 --> 18:52.225
Marry a finance guy and...

18:52.227 --> 18:55.478
Do charity stuff.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.514
Damn you, Donaghy.

19:07.741 --> 19:09.058
What a loser.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.843
You had me mail that birthday card.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.445
That didn't need to happen.

19:12.447 --> 19:15.498
That was just mean.

19:21.672 --> 19:22.789
What's going on here?

19:22.791 --> 19:24.257
And where did you get that sweater?

19:24.259 --> 19:26.376
Is that from chico's
harvest naturals collection?

19:26.378 --> 19:28.211
Octavia Spencer got arrested
for soliciting sex

19:28.213 --> 19:30.013
from an undercover police dog.

19:30.015 --> 19:32.799
I had to shut down
my whole movie because of her.

19:32.801 --> 19:34.917
She turned out to be a Tracy Jordan.

19:34.919 --> 19:37.353
So, to deal with her,
I tried to be a Liz Lemon.

19:37.355 --> 19:38.805
Yeah, well, being Liz Lemon

19:38.807 --> 19:40.756
isn't just about wearing
a sweater and...

19:40.758 --> 19:43.026
Hey, those are my glasses.

19:43.028 --> 19:45.361
And you popped the lenses out?

19:45.363 --> 19:46.779
No, they shattered in a urinal.

19:46.781 --> 19:48.597
L.L., I don't know
how you do it.

19:48.599 --> 19:50.616
I couldn't hack it
with octavia for one day.

19:50.618 --> 19:53.369
And you've been getting amazing,
thought-provoking work out of me

19:53.371 --> 19:55.204
for seven years.

19:56.607 --> 19:57.790
Thanks, Tray.

19:57.792 --> 19:59.158
I mean, it hasn't been easy.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.576
When you first came into my life,

20:00.578 --> 20:03.046
you were out of control,
and you had horrible habits.

20:03.048 --> 20:04.048
Like my booger-eating?

20:04.049 --> 20:06.165
Please, let me just have one.

20:06.167 --> 20:07.616
I need it, baby.

20:07.618 --> 20:09.052
Taking care of you has been exhausting.

20:09.054 --> 20:11.454
You'd fight me
and have temper tantrums,

20:11.456 --> 20:14.457
and I'd have to stay up
all night 'cause you were sick.

20:14.459 --> 20:16.125
Hey, those lego men
were on a rescue mission

20:16.127 --> 20:18.811
to save the other lego men
that I swallowed.

20:18.813 --> 20:20.480
But as problematic as you were,

20:20.482 --> 20:22.598
I had no choice but to make it work.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.268
Elizibart, you are an amazing woman.

20:25.270 --> 20:28.237
Seriously, if you can take care of me,

20:28.239 --> 20:31.274
you can do anything.

20:33.977 --> 20:37.580
Hey, remember that thing
we talked about the other day,

20:37.582 --> 20:38.664
about adopting an older kid?

20:38.666 --> 20:39.832
Well, I want to do it.

20:39.834 --> 20:41.834
Bitch, more than one person works here.

20:41.836 --> 20:43.836
- Who is this?
- It's Elizabeth Lemon.

20:43.838 --> 20:46.172
Who?

20:48.136 --> 20:50.221
- Action.
- Every dream begins with a...

20:50.272 --> 20:52.106
- Line?
- Dreamer.

20:52.140 --> 20:54.525
- Action.
- You have within you...

20:54.560 --> 20:55.693
Line?

20:55.727 --> 20:57.612
- Strength and...
- I got it. I got it.

20:57.646 --> 20:59.530
Line?

20:59.565 --> 21:01.485
Yo, Mizz, what's the name
of that crazy-ass place

21:01.516 --> 21:02.516
we went last night?

21:02.534 --> 21:03.534
Bed bath & beyond.

21:03.535 --> 21:04.702
We went beyond.

21:04.736 --> 21:06.536
- And action.
- Line?

21:07.305 --> 21:13.797
