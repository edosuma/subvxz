00:09.043 --> 00:10.844
DAVID: OK, we're nearing
the end with me in the lead,

00:10.878 --> 00:16.350
naturally, followed by Darlene
with 137, then back with 123,

00:16.384 --> 00:19.487
and bringing up the rear, Mark,
with a personal best of 73.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.354
All right.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.593
Darlene, you're up.

00:25.626 --> 00:26.427
OK.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.465
Oh, I got it.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.067
Just put down the Y.

00:33.101 --> 00:33.901
Buckety?

00:36.770 --> 00:39.940
It's not a word.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.475
Of course, it is.

00:41.509 --> 00:45.279
It means of or pertaining to
or having the characteristics

00:45.313 --> 00:49.417
of a bucket, as in
when Roseanne is angry

00:49.450 --> 00:53.721
her mouth is quite buckety.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.423
I'm looking it up.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.259
Here's an interesting bit
of trivia for you, David.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.529
Milton Bradley was
killed by his girlfriend.

01:01.562 --> 01:07.201
OK, 18 plus the Y on the
double letter score is 24.

01:07.235 --> 01:11.772
You wouldn't give me twinkie,
but you give her buckety.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.941
Fine.
You challenge her then.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.909
Yeah, and then I'll
go poke mom with a stick

01:15.943 --> 01:18.946
while she's sleeping.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.514
Ah, none of this
really matters,

01:20.548 --> 01:21.749
because I'm going to win.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.118
[laughs]

01:24.152 --> 01:25.453
What's it going to
be this time, Mark?

01:25.486 --> 01:29.257
It or is?

01:29.290 --> 01:31.359
Read it and weep, smart guys.

01:31.392 --> 01:37.631
Oxygen.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.367
Wow.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.769
That's x on a
triple letter score

01:41.802 --> 01:46.540
plus triple word score is 99.

01:46.574 --> 01:49.343
Add that onto what he has--

01:49.377 --> 01:55.549
my god, that puts
Mark in the lead.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.617
Oh, I won.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.518
I won.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.287
I finally won.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.355
The knowledge in my
head is quite buckety.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.730
I'm the boss of you.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.964
I'm the boss of you.

02:10.998 --> 02:14.202
An I've have always
been the boss of you.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.343
Wait a minute, Mark.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.578
Oxygen is not a word.

02:28.649 --> 02:35.723
Yeah, she's right,
oxygen. Good one.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.992
That's not a word.

02:39.026 --> 02:41.462
Yeah.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.863
It's an abbreviation.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.269
Bull.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.739
I saw it on air tanks.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.307
Yeah, of course,
that's because they

02:53.341 --> 02:56.009
have to use the abbreviation,
because the full word wouldn't

02:56.043 --> 02:59.213
fit on the air tank,
unless you printed

02:59.247 --> 03:02.182
it vertically, which is--

03:02.216 --> 03:03.317
which is just against the law.

03:10.891 --> 03:11.692
OK.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.332
It.

03:21.935 --> 03:25.806
[theme music]

04:17.090 --> 04:18.759
DJ: Yeah, I'm sure this time.

04:18.792 --> 04:19.860
That's what I want.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.195
All right, now deliver
that to 714 Delaware

04:22.229 --> 04:24.532
Street, Lanford, Illinois.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.533
Excuse me.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.835
I think I left my
credit card here.

04:27.868 --> 04:28.669
Never mind.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.309
Well, I'm sorry, pumpkin.

04:35.343 --> 04:39.246
I just don't feel like
going out tonight.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.214
I mean, I know
it's Saturday, OK.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.984
But not every night
has to be a party.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.085
Every night?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.286
We never go out.

04:46.320 --> 04:50.824
The Olympic torch goes
out more often than we do.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.594
Well, I'm tired after, OK?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.229
Besides it's hard being
around people after being

04:56.263 --> 04:59.367
around that all day.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.769
Sticks and stones
may break my bones,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.704
but at least they're
not part of my sex life.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.878
He never wants to do anything
but lie around the house.

05:10.911 --> 05:14.181
I don't know how he
can call himself gay.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.384
By the way, he came
out of the closet

05:16.417 --> 05:19.553
and headed straight
for the couch.

05:19.587 --> 05:20.954
What time do you
think Nana Mary is going

05:20.988 --> 05:21.955
to get to my place tonight?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.391
Well, if she
remembers her glasses,

05:23.424 --> 05:25.158
she'll be in Lanford in an hour.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.961
And if not, she'll be
in Lansing by midnight.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.930
She was so excited
to meet my Andy.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.965
She must be dying to meet Gerry.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.867
Yeah, you know,
she's excited to have

05:33.901 --> 05:38.138
someone else in a family that
has a soft spot in their head.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.475
Hey, honey, get those
sandwiches for the poker game?

05:41.509 --> 05:43.076
Yeah, I do.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.745
I made them last
week, so you'll have

05:44.778 --> 05:46.246
to nuke them for
about 10 seconds

05:46.279 --> 05:47.381
to reactivate the grease.

05:50.751 --> 05:54.221
Hey, maverick, why don't
you invite Leon and Scott

05:54.254 --> 05:55.923
for your poker game tonight?

05:55.956 --> 05:56.924
Oh, that sounds wonderful.

05:56.957 --> 05:57.825
What time, Dan--

05:57.858 --> 05:58.859
4:00.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.260
We start at 4:00.

06:00.293 --> 06:01.795
Love to have you.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.465
You know, he just
may go for this.

06:04.498 --> 06:08.035
I'll pass it off as a new and
different cultural experience.

06:08.068 --> 06:12.205
Yeah, Dan got the
jalapeno Doritos this time.

06:12.239 --> 06:13.340
Roseanne, what are you doing?

06:13.373 --> 06:15.142
This is supposed to be a
night out for the guys.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.043
What?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.345
You don't count them as guys?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.747
No, it's not that.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.148
They're married.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.916
They'll be nagging each other
all night long about how much

06:22.950 --> 06:26.654
they drank, how
much their betting.

06:26.687 --> 06:29.256
Is that $5 your
money or our money?

06:29.289 --> 06:32.793
Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.595
It would be like if you came.

06:38.766 --> 06:39.767
OK, they can come.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.505
Well, I tried.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.773
I tried everything.

06:45.806 --> 06:49.276
He absolutely will not
come to this poker game.

06:49.309 --> 06:53.146
Well, did you let him know
that I'm not going to be there?

06:53.180 --> 06:54.815
I'll bring the dip.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.627

07:06.660 --> 07:10.230
Oh, that's your great grandma.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.066
Nana Mary is really
kind of crazy.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.570
She drinks too much and
she's loud and obnoxious.

07:16.604 --> 07:20.407
But she's got some killer
stories about the Depression.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.408
Hi.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.409
Hello.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.343
Hello, Jackie.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.054
Hello, sweetheart.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.223
Could you run down
to the drugstore,

07:36.256 --> 07:39.392
please, Jackie, and get
me a pack of smokes.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.629
Maybe later, yeah, Nana.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.530
All right, honey.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.331
Oh, Rosie, hello.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.599
Hey.

07:45.633 --> 07:49.837
This here is your great
grandson Jerry Garcia Conner.

07:49.870 --> 07:50.738
Hello.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.205
Hello, Jerry.

07:52.239 --> 07:53.473
Oh, he's cute.

07:53.507 --> 07:55.108
He's cute, big.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.911
Hey, fourth baby or not,
this one really had to hurt.

08:00.814 --> 08:01.849
You want to hold him?

08:01.882 --> 08:02.750
No.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.618
They all drip.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.220
I'll hold him when he's three.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.656
OK, nap time.

08:08.689 --> 08:09.723
Oh, that sounds great.

08:09.757 --> 08:10.624
I'm ready.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.160
No, she means the kids.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.762
Oh, that's OK, too.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.029
Here.

08:16.063 --> 08:18.265
That a boy.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.833
OK, so what's in the box here?

08:19.867 --> 08:22.502
I hope it's not more clothes
from all your dead friends.

08:22.536 --> 08:26.173
It's all the toys that you and
Jackie used to play with when

08:26.206 --> 08:28.709
you came over to my house
because your mother and father

08:28.742 --> 08:29.877
were trying to kill each other.

08:29.910 --> 08:30.778
Remember?

08:30.811 --> 08:32.245
Oh my, look at this stuff.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.147
This is all of our toys.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.718
This is going to make
me so sentimental.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.987
Yeah, but it's
not all the toys.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.789
Anything that was
worth any money

08:41.822 --> 08:44.424
went to pay for my new hip.

08:44.457 --> 08:48.929
This box actually
smells like the 1950s.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.263
Oh, Ike.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.905
It's going to be so great.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.172
You know, just like old times.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.775
The three of us sitting
around and remembering

09:01.809 --> 09:05.412
all the old stuff
that used to happen.

09:05.445 --> 09:08.181
[snores]

09:10.651 --> 09:12.452
Well, her hair
is already short,

09:12.485 --> 09:15.188
but just for old time's sake,
let's get the scissors anyway.

09:15.222 --> 09:18.091
[music playing]

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
Kings bet, see.

09:29.603 --> 09:31.238
I'm in.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.041
I'll see you and raise you $1.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.776
Ooh, well, I'm out.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.310
Scott's probably bluffing,
you know, like when

09:37.344 --> 09:38.145
he said he could cook.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.149
Dealer's in.

09:42.182 --> 09:45.686
And you're just upset
because you're down $10.

09:45.719 --> 09:47.621
I am in.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.857
Or because it's been six
weeks since the wedding

09:49.890 --> 09:52.225
and someone I know hasn't
answered their share

09:52.259 --> 09:53.126
of the thank you notes.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.394
And I spent the last--

09:54.427 --> 09:57.064
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.499
I though I told you
guys no marriage talk.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.902
We're here to play
cards, not chitchat

10:01.935 --> 10:03.671
He's been chatting
about the Bulls game.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.705
Games are OK.

10:04.738 --> 10:05.605
Cars?

10:05.639 --> 10:08.175
Cars are fine, too.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.044
How about the arts?

10:11.078 --> 10:13.346
You follow the arts, Bob?

10:13.380 --> 10:15.649
What is it, like theater?

10:15.683 --> 10:18.618
Yes, I keep up
with the theater.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.320
In a tabloid the other
day, I saw a picture

10:20.353 --> 10:23.056
of OJ going to Damn Yankees.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.458
Let's-- uh-- let's
not talk about that.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.694
What?
Damn Yankees?

10:26.727 --> 10:27.627
Why not?

10:27.661 --> 10:29.196
I hear the
choreography has verve.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.134
He meant OJ, Bob.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.537
I mean some people are afraid
to discuss it in mixed company.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.707
Yes, I for one am sick of OJ.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.941
He's on the golf course.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.242
He's making a video.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.245
I wish he would just go away.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.646
Why can't the man
do what he wants?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.148
He was acquitted.
- Oh, please.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.983
Chuck, come on.

10:50.017 --> 10:52.619
I mean, even you have to
admit that trial was a joke.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.553
I didn't think so.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.088
I was happy with
the way it come out.

10:55.122 --> 10:55.989
Me too.

10:56.023 --> 10:56.890
I'm getting another beer.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.826
Anybody want one?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.093
I brought salad.

11:00.127 --> 11:04.765
Look, Chuck, please, the
verdict was ridiculous.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.633
Look, all I know, it's
hard for a black man

11:06.666 --> 11:08.268
to get a fair shake
in this country.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.705
OK, well, you try being a
gay man in Lanford, Illinois.

11:11.739 --> 11:14.074
I mean there is nothing
like having to correct

11:14.107 --> 11:15.876
the spelling when
somebody paints

11:15.909 --> 11:17.644
faggot across your garage door.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.583
Leon, when I walk down the
street, people know I'm black.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.485
Now when you walk down the
street, for all people know,

11:25.518 --> 11:27.254
you're just another white guy.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.421
With a great ass.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.664
They don't care, Scott.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.399
Look, Chuck have
either of you guys

11:39.432 --> 11:41.368
ever heard of a little
thing called gay bashing.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.603
Look, don't talk to
me about hate crimes.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.172
Most of them are directed at us.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.208
Guys, guys, guys, you've
both made some valid points.

11:48.241 --> 11:49.943
Can't we all just
accept the fact

11:49.977 --> 11:53.513
that we've all got it tough?

11:53.546 --> 11:57.584
Hey, happy, what
do you mean we?

11:57.617 --> 11:58.551
What?

11:58.585 --> 12:02.122
Dan, you're a
straight white male.

12:02.155 --> 12:07.060
You've got it easier than
anybody in the whole world.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.197
Yeah, OK, it may
seem like that, Chuck.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.399
But I'm telling you
lately us white males been

12:12.432 --> 12:14.034
getting blamed for everything.

12:14.067 --> 12:18.205
Maybe that's because
you did everything.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.909
Listen, I've never
done anything in my life.

12:21.942 --> 12:22.742
Ask anyone.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.049
Yeah, OK, listen, I've
been hearing a lot lately

12:29.082 --> 12:31.651
about how white men are
to blame for everything

12:31.684 --> 12:33.686
about, how we have all
the advantages, how

12:33.720 --> 12:35.255
we get all the breaks.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.457
But look at me and Bob, we
ain't living in no mansion.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.293
We had to struggle
for everything we got.

12:40.327 --> 12:44.564
You struggled for this?

12:44.597 --> 12:47.500
[car approaching]

12:47.534 --> 12:48.468
Shh.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.937
[engine stops]

12:49.970 --> 12:50.904
[car door closes]

12:50.938 --> 12:53.907
Roseanne's home.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.309
Hi.

12:56.343 --> 12:59.446
False alarm.

12:59.479 --> 13:03.750
Well, I guess we do
have some common ground.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.285
Coming around again,
brothers and sisters.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.353
Not guilty.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.088
Not guilt is not
the same as innocent.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.322
Not guilty.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.691
Why would a man get
in a car and drive--

13:11.724 --> 13:14.027
[music playing]

13:17.931 --> 13:20.934
Oh, you should see
them sleeping in there.

13:20.968 --> 13:21.835
It's so cute.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.403
You wouldn't believe it.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.840
You know, Jerry had pulled
all the covers over himself.

13:26.874 --> 13:31.244
And little Andy is like laying
there shivering, you know.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.114
And his face pressed up
against the crib bars.

13:37.684 --> 13:40.587
Well, I hope you
took care of it.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.490
Took care of what?

13:43.523 --> 13:44.892
Well, let's go
through the box now.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.193
OK?

13:46.226 --> 13:48.695
No, we can't do it while
Nana Mary still's sleeping.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.031
That's totally inconsiderate.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.200
Roseanne, no, you know her.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.068
She's not Going to wake up.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.905
Well, let me give
it one more shot.

13:57.938 --> 14:03.410
Hey, look, there goes Tyrone
Power in his underwear.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.513
All right, we're
going in without her.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.316
Oh, it's like stepping
into a time warp.

14:09.349 --> 14:12.352
And finding a great
big box of crap.

14:12.385 --> 14:17.257
Oh, man, I was six before I
realized this was not a pet.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.095
This is my cast
when I broke my arm.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.863
What's this doing
with Nana Mary?

14:23.897 --> 14:24.965
Don't you remember?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.533
She thought you were
acting like a big baby,

14:26.566 --> 14:30.803
so she cut it off a week
early with her pinking shears.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.739
And to this day,
it is hard to get

14:32.772 --> 14:36.743
a blazer to lay right on me.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.345
Oh, look at this.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.613
Princess Isabella lives.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.082
Dat da da da.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.251
Let's see if yours is in there.

14:44.284 --> 14:47.220
Oh, there you go, Queen
of the Dirt Monkeys.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.159
What are you doing in my palace.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.294
I've come to
dethrone you, princess.

14:54.327 --> 14:58.131
Come, my dirt monkey minions

14:58.165 --> 15:01.969
You shall never get my throne
because your red, shiny monkey

15:02.002 --> 15:03.870
butt it's too big.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.206
My god, it's my doll.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.474
It's my Mrs. Tuttle.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.043
Oh, my god, I thought
she was lost forever.

15:10.077 --> 15:11.044
Where have you been?

15:11.078 --> 15:13.813
I missed you so much.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.984
Well, her and Mr.
Tuttle got a little condo

15:17.017 --> 15:19.619
outside of Fort Lauderdale.

15:19.652 --> 15:22.189
So the last time I saw
her I know we were sleeping

15:22.222 --> 15:23.423
over at Nana Mary's house.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.825
And I had her with me
before we went to sleep.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.161
And when I woke
up, she was gone.

15:28.195 --> 15:32.465
Well, yeah, probably,
you know, Nana Mary, she

15:32.499 --> 15:34.467
might have taken
her away from you

15:34.501 --> 15:36.503
because, well, she
thought you were getting

15:36.536 --> 15:40.940
too attached or something.

15:40.974 --> 15:43.710
And as I recall, you told
me there was a string of doll

15:43.743 --> 15:46.879
nappings plaguing the area.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.681
Yeah.
Yeah.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.418
My Betsy Wetsy was so nervous
that she held it in for days.

15:54.254 --> 15:57.057
Mrs. Tuttle was not kidnapped.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.159
And Nana Mary didn't
take the doll.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.095
Of course Nana Mary
didn't take the doll.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.698
A workman was
cleaning out my attic.

16:05.732 --> 16:09.402
And he found it stuffed
behind some insulation.

16:09.436 --> 16:14.241
I was so glad it wasn't
another dead body.

16:14.274 --> 16:19.912
Doll napper, thieving
evil rotten doll napper.

16:19.946 --> 16:21.314
Admit it.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.682
Admit it.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.017
OK I took her.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.018
Are you happy?

16:25.052 --> 16:29.689
No, on the contrary,
it sickens me.

16:29.722 --> 16:30.657
Why, Roseanne?

16:30.690 --> 16:32.725
Why would you take Mrs. Tuttle?

16:32.759 --> 16:33.993
Yeah, why?

16:34.027 --> 16:36.029
Why does the chicken
cross the road?

16:36.063 --> 16:37.164
To get at the gin.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.066
Come on, stop fighting
and let's have a drink.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.668
It's getting dark.

16:41.701 --> 16:44.304
I took her
because I hated her.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.205
Why?

16:45.238 --> 16:47.340
What did she ever do to you?

16:47.374 --> 16:50.843
Well, if you want to know,
just when we were little,

16:50.877 --> 16:54.814
you used to think of me
as some kind of a goddess.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.683
You would do whatever
I want you to do,

16:56.716 --> 16:57.784
whatever I told you to do.

16:57.817 --> 16:58.751
And I'm liked that, Jackie.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.088
I liked feeling
all that control.

17:01.121 --> 17:04.957
And then Mrs.
Tuttle came around.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.260
Go on.

17:07.294 --> 17:09.662
And then all of a sudden, I
just didn't matter any more,

17:09.696 --> 17:10.597
did I?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.332
I mean, I'd be like,
come on, Jackie,

17:12.365 --> 17:13.866
do you want to go
play jump rope?

17:13.900 --> 17:15.735
Instead of just
saying, yes, you had

17:15.768 --> 17:18.405
to run and ask Mrs. Tuttle if
she wanted to play jump rope.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.473
And of course, she didn't
want to jump rope, did she?

17:20.507 --> 17:23.543
No, she wanted to play
marbles or play with dolls

17:23.576 --> 17:25.112
or have a tea party.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.880
She never wanted to do
anything that I wanted to do.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.951
Tuttle asked for it.

17:31.984 --> 17:32.852
So I smoked her.

17:36.989 --> 17:40.527
By shoving her
behind some insulation.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.628
Turn her over.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.995
You'll see what the
rats did to her butt.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.169
[baby sounds]

17:50.670 --> 17:51.571
I'm gong to check on Jerry.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.920
Jerry steel the
blankets again.

18:07.954 --> 18:08.821
No, look.

18:08.855 --> 18:09.722
Oh, look it.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.958
They're all cuddled up together.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.927
NANA MARY: That's the
way you use to nap.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.264
Cuddled.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.466
As a matter of fact, it
sounds like a good idea,

18:19.499 --> 18:22.369
nap around about now.

18:22.402 --> 18:23.903
Uh-- Roseanne,
there's something

18:23.936 --> 18:24.904
that you need to know.

18:24.937 --> 18:25.872
You don't deserve to know it.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.175
But I'm going to
tell you anyway.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.142
Mrs. Tuttle loved you.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.246
Get out of here.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.081
She loved you, Roseanne.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.816
I'd complain about you
and I'd put you down.

18:36.849 --> 18:41.354
And she always, always
stood up for you.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.589
This lady was in your corner.

18:46.193 --> 18:46.993
I didn't know.

18:49.862 --> 18:53.833
She should've told me.

18:53.866 --> 18:54.867
Well, that just
wasn't her way.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.273
I hope they're nicer to
each other than we were.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.509
I mean, they're going to
grow up practically brothers.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.612
You don't think Jerry is, like,
going to terrorize little Andy,

19:05.645 --> 19:06.613
do you?
- No.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.415
How could that happen?
Andy's older.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.817
But Jerry's your
kid, Roseanne.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.485
You use to mopped
the floor with me.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.154
He already took the
blankets before.

19:15.188 --> 19:19.492
Next thing you know, Andy will
be stuffed in some insulation.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.927
No, he won't.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.997
We'll make sure we-- you
know, we'll break the cycle.

19:25.031 --> 19:29.035
And I promise I will make sure
that Jerry is as sweet to Andy

19:29.068 --> 19:34.040
as I should have been to you.

19:34.073 --> 19:38.177
That'll still leave him open
for a whole lot of pounding.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.646
Thanks.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.582
NANA MARY: Come on,
everybody, it's sun down.

19:42.615 --> 19:45.051
Who's up for a daiquiri?

19:45.084 --> 19:47.420
[blending sound]

19:49.489 --> 19:51.858
[music playing]

19:54.894 --> 20:00.199
I'll see that and
bump it 50 cents.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.502
I'm telling you
that Damn Yankees

20:02.535 --> 20:05.738
was a terpsichorean delight.

20:05.772 --> 20:08.775
I'm always amazed at your
Philistine inclination.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.411
I'm in.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.546
I'm afraid I have
to concur, Bob.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.583
There's such an artificial,
studied formalness to so much

20:16.616 --> 20:17.517
Broadway choreography.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.753
Give me Martha Graham any day.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.689
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about, man.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.324
Martha Graham?

20:24.357 --> 20:26.526
If you haven't seen the
Phoenix Dance Company,

20:26.559 --> 20:28.561
you haven't experienced dance.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.463
I'll bump one.

20:30.497 --> 20:35.902
Phoenix Dance Company is
yesterday's mummenschanz.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.103
Hey, don't knock mummenschanz.

20:37.136 --> 20:40.673
Mummenschanz, that's where
theater and dance merge.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.343
Gentlemen, let's get back to
what we're discussing before.

20:43.376 --> 20:45.378
I still maintain that
the Boston Pops set

20:45.412 --> 20:47.213
classical music back 50 years.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.415
Here, here.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.217
Oh, you know what this
discussion reminds me of?

20:51.250 --> 20:53.219
Puccini's La Granada.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.422
[laughter]

20:57.724 --> 20:58.591
Oh.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.826
Oh.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.895
That Vermeer exhibit in
Washington changed my life.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.263
Oh, yeah.

21:04.297 --> 21:08.568
Vermeer, Bob, yes, but just
as you are dealing this game,

21:08.601 --> 21:11.070
the artist in any field
must acknowledge that his

21:11.103 --> 21:12.605
is a Nakovian presence.

21:12.639 --> 21:16.175
He must cast off any
pretense of a studied

21:16.208 --> 21:19.712
and artificial naturalism.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.381
He must be wholly
present in his work.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.449
I agree.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.516
Read and weep, suckers.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.785
Aces full of eights.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.654
I was going for a straight.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.288
That's three in a row.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.391
I ain't playing here no more.

21:31.424 --> 21:34.361
[music playing]
