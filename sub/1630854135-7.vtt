WEBVTT

00:09.926 --> 00:10.301
.

00:10.343 --> 00:11.302
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:12.095 --> 00:13.430
the people are represented

00:13.471 --> 00:16.182
by two separate,
yet equally important groups:

00:16.224 --> 00:17.976
the police,
who investigate crime,

00:18.018 --> 00:20.854
and the district attorneys,
who prosecute the offenders.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.398
These are their stories.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.442
- Mr. Zanford! Mr. Zanford!
- How do you feel about

00:25.483 --> 00:26.735
your wife serving you
with divorce papers

00:26.776 --> 00:28.111
on the floor of the stock
exchange this morning?

00:28.153 --> 00:30.363
- Blindsided.
How the hell would you feel?

00:30.405 --> 00:31.865
- Um, excuse me!
I have one more question.

00:31.906 --> 00:34.242
Do you have a minute?
- Toxicity and negativity

00:34.284 --> 00:36.202
are contrary
to everything Mark Zanford

00:36.244 --> 00:38.163
has spent the last 20 years
building.

00:38.204 --> 00:40.623
His app, Connectivity,
promotes healthy,

00:40.665 --> 00:43.335
positive connections,
and so does Mark.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.378
- Will your personal problems
impact the company?

00:45.420 --> 00:47.797
Do you think that's why
the stock price is off 10%?

00:47.839 --> 00:50.884
- Mark's wife tried
to ruin his moment in the sun.

00:50.925 --> 00:54.429
That alone should tell you
what kind of a woman she is.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.598
- This whole nightmare
is your fault.

00:56.639 --> 00:59.225
- I'm not the one shagging
a 20-year-old yoga teacher.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.770
- Just do your job.

01:04.856 --> 01:06.107
- [exhales]

01:06.149 --> 01:08.276
- DOA is Dana Clarkson.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.779
43 years old, single, no kids.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.447
Lives on Central Park West.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.948
Possible strangulation.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.533
- [whistles, sighs]

01:15.575 --> 01:17.994
Bruises on her face,
abrasions on her hands.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.537
She put up a fight.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.081
- Have the MLI bag her hands
and get a sexual assault kit.

01:21.122 --> 01:22.082
- You get a time of death?

01:22.123 --> 01:23.416
- MLI puts it at some time

01:23.458 --> 01:24.834
between 8:00 and midnight
last night.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.127
- Witnesses?

01:26.169 --> 01:27.962
- Woman who runs
the laundromat called it in.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.423
Found the body on the stairs
when she came to open up.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.675
- How about cameras?

01:31.716 --> 01:32.884
- Nothing so far.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.803
- She's still got
her credit cards and cash.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.596
- Her phone is missing,

01:36.638 --> 01:38.431
assuming she had one with her,
of course.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.100
Found this on the ground.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.935
[tense music]

01:41.976 --> 01:43.436
- Connectivity.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.313
Must have been
at some sort of event.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.399
- Looks like
she was a crisis consultant.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.652
- Yeah, well,
some things aren't fixable.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.283
[dramatic music]

01:57.325 --> 02:04.457
* *

02:40.410 --> 02:42.412
Dana Clarkson
was at your event last night.

02:42.454 --> 02:43.580
- That's correct.

02:43.621 --> 02:44.873
- What were you two arguing
about?

02:44.914 --> 02:46.666
- Arguing?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.752
This whole nightmare
is your fault.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.713
- I'm not the one shagging
a 20-year-old yoga teacher.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.131
- I was venting.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.466
Half of Dana's job
is putting up

02:54.507 --> 02:56.384
with loudmouthed alphas
like me.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.969
- Where did you
and Ms. Clarkson go

02:58.011 --> 02:59.137
after you got in the car?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.680
- I went to my apartment.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.474
Dana was supposed
to go to hers.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.892
- Supposed to?
- Yeah.

03:03.933 --> 03:04.976
She got a text.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.311
Uh, made her really mad,

03:06.353 --> 03:07.979
and she asked my driver
to pull over.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.481
And she got out of the car.

03:09.522 --> 03:12.859
- Can you think of anyone
who didn't like Dana?

03:12.901 --> 03:13.902
- Yeah, lots of people.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.904
She had sharp elbows.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.739
That's why I hired her.

03:17.781 --> 03:20.825
- Did any of those people
show up to your IPO party?

03:20.867 --> 03:23.828
- My crazy soon-to-be ex-wife
tried to crash the event.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.164
- What,
Dana got involved in that?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.457
- She did, yeah,
she called security,

03:27.499 --> 03:29.751
had them toss her out.

03:29.793 --> 03:32.337
That's what a crisis manager
does.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.297
Then my wife went crazy.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.341
Started swearing at Dana.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.635
She threw a glass at her.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.553
And she threatened to kill her.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.972
She blames Dana
for ruining her career.

03:43.014 --> 03:43.932
- Did she?

03:45.767 --> 03:48.895
- I didn't pay Dana 500 grand
for nothing.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.733
- Hey, I just got off the phone
with the medical examiner.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.861
Cause of death
was mechanical asphyxiation.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.988
She thinks the killer
may have used some kind

03:59.030 --> 04:00.323
of soft piece of clothing.

04:00.365 --> 04:03.618
They found some blue
and white and maroon fibers

04:03.660 --> 04:05.120
on her throat.
- Necktie?

04:05.161 --> 04:06.079
- They think it's a scarf.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.539
Forensics shows some kind

04:07.580 --> 04:10.417
of high-end mulberry silk.
- DNA?

04:10.458 --> 04:12.460
- Yeah,
they found some skin cells

04:12.502 --> 04:13.920
underneath
the victim's fingernails,

04:13.962 --> 04:16.047
so we're just waiting
on the results now.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.925
- Well, it wasn't Zanford.
The driver backs up his story.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.385
- Does the driver know why
Dana got out

04:20.427 --> 04:21.761
of the car so suddenly?

04:21.803 --> 04:24.014
- Nah, he just pulled over
and she just hopped out.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.598
- What about Zanford's wife?

04:25.640 --> 04:27.434
- She's bitter as hell,
that's for sure.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.103
Her social media is a--
practically a tribute

04:30.145 --> 04:31.354
to her hatred of Dana Clarkson.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.149
- Yeah, and she doesn't just
talk the talk.

04:34.190 --> 04:35.567
There's violence in her past.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.945
Last year she was accused
of assaulting her assistant.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.448
- Well, last night
she was assaulting martinis.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.450
This is her at the Lava Club.

04:43.491 --> 04:44.868
- Is that in Midtown?

04:44.909 --> 04:45.910
- East 53rd.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.620
- Not far
from the murder scene.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.957
- Yeah, and I bet
she owns a few silk scarves.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.585
Let's find out where she lives,
get a search warrant.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.300
- Why is the story
of a crazy woman so compelling?

05:00.342 --> 05:02.677
- Pretty simple--you threatened
to kill Dana Clarkson

05:02.719 --> 05:04.095
a few hours
before she was killed.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.390
- Okay, do you know
how many people hated Dana?

05:07.432 --> 05:08.850
- So you admit, you hated her?

05:08.892 --> 05:10.643
- Yes, definitely.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.063
She planted fake stories
about me having affairs,

05:13.104 --> 05:14.564
being an alcoholic.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.816
Last night
she paid a photographer

05:16.858 --> 05:18.902
to trip me outside of some club

05:18.943 --> 05:20.862
just to make me look like
a drunken fool.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.031
- What do you got?
- Ms. Zanford...

05:25.492 --> 05:28.161
You wanna explain this?

05:28.203 --> 05:30.121
[tense music]

05:30.163 --> 05:31.206
- Um...

05:31.247 --> 05:32.749
[handcuffs clinking]
It's...

05:32.791 --> 05:35.043
it's--it's not--
it's not what you think.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.795
- Well,
I think you're under arrest

05:36.836 --> 05:39.506
for the murder
of Dana Clarkson.

05:46.262 --> 05:46.638
.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.889
- Like I keep telling you,
I didn't kill her.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.017
- The shirt is being tested
for DNA.

05:51.059 --> 05:54.187
When the blood comes back
as Dana Clarkson's,

05:54.229 --> 05:56.189
the time
for explanations will be over.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.983
Now is your chance to get out
in front of this.

06:02.904 --> 06:07.701
- Uh, blood
on that shirt isn't Dana's.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.744
It's mine.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.747
[somber music]

06:12.789 --> 06:15.542
* *

06:15.583 --> 06:17.043
- You self-harm?

06:17.085 --> 06:19.254
- Yes.

06:19.295 --> 06:24.009
I started
when I was a teenager and...

06:24.050 --> 06:28.054
then when Mark and I separated,

06:28.096 --> 06:30.890
people started attacking me
online.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.393
I just felt very alone.

06:33.435 --> 06:36.896
* *

06:36.938 --> 06:39.983
- Uh, forensics. Not a match.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.901
- You're free to go, ma'am.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.862
- Officer Preston's
gonna show you out.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.703
The skin cells found under
the victim's fingernails

06:51.745 --> 06:53.038
weren't a match.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.248
The DNA belongs to a man, so...

06:55.290 --> 06:57.375
- So we're looking for a man
with no criminal record.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.044
- Mostly likely someone
with a personal grudge

06:59.085 --> 07:00.503
against the vic.
- That's right.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.796
So we're gonna keep digging.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.298
We're gonna look
into her personal life,

07:03.340 --> 07:05.550
into her professional life.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.178
Someone with a job like that is
bound to have a lot of enemies.

07:08.219 --> 07:12.640
* *

07:12.682 --> 07:14.559
- Dana was
a never-let-'em-see-you-sweat

07:14.601 --> 07:16.019
kind of woman.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.396
Came from nothing,
grew up in rural West Virginia.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.565
Her father was a coal miner.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.234
She worked like hell
to build her firm, her life.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.736
- The day of the murder,

07:24.778 --> 07:26.112
anything
out of the ordinary happen?

07:26.154 --> 07:29.240
- She had a lunch with someone.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.658
The name wasn't
on her calendar,

07:30.700 --> 07:32.077
which was weird.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.120
- Well,
everybody's got secrets.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.622
- When she came back
from lunch,

07:35.663 --> 07:37.123
she asked
for the nonemergency number

07:37.165 --> 07:39.876
for the local police precinct.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.419
- Where was this lunch?

07:41.461 --> 07:44.464
- I'll get that for you.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.174
- I just--
[sighs]

07:46.216 --> 07:49.719
I--I can't believe Dana's dead.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.513
- How'd you know her?

07:51.554 --> 07:54.307
- Well, we've been friends
for, like, 20 years,

07:54.349 --> 07:55.642
since college.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.394
We get together ever time
I'm in the city.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.854
I--I live in Zurich full-time.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.316
But she is--

08:03.358 --> 08:06.069
was an amazing woman.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.029
I always told her,
if I weren't gay,

08:08.071 --> 08:09.781
I'd have proposed years ago.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.866
[chuckles]

08:11.908 --> 08:13.451
- Did anything happen
during lunch,

08:13.493 --> 08:16.287
something that would upset her
enough to call the police?

08:17.914 --> 08:21.584
- Dana was worried about
this ex-boyfriend.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.294
- Was he harassing her?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.422
- More like stalking.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.925
I mean, he reappeared
in her life a few months ago.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.011
And she told him, like,
"Leave me alone,"

08:31.052 --> 08:32.762
but he wouldn't let it go.

08:32.804 --> 08:35.140
She was terrified.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.017
- Was he ever violent with her?

08:37.058 --> 08:38.810
- Yeah,
when they were together,

08:38.852 --> 08:40.562
she ended up
in the emergency room.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.522
I mean, at least once.

08:42.564 --> 08:44.024
Maybe twice.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.734
- You got this guy's name?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.490
- Dana and I had dated
a few years ago,

08:52.532 --> 08:55.368
even lived together,
on paper at least.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.786
- What does that mean?

08:56.828 --> 08:58.288
- She wasn't ready
for real intimacy.

08:58.329 --> 09:00.999
- She broke it off?
- It--it was amicable.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.959
We wanted different things.
- Amicable?

09:03.001 --> 09:04.377
We checked
her hospital records.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.963
She was admitted to the ER
at least twice

09:07.005 --> 09:08.048
while you guys were dating.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.341
One for a cut above her eye,

09:09.382 --> 09:12.260
and the other
for a broken wrist, so...

09:12.302 --> 09:13.470
- What the hell are you trying
to say, that I had something

09:13.511 --> 09:14.637
to do with that?

09:14.679 --> 09:16.097
- Correct.
- Well, you're wrong.

09:16.139 --> 09:16.973
- Maybe.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.058
Just have a few more questions

09:18.099 --> 09:20.352
and we'll be out of your hair.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.395
When's the last time you spoke
to Dana?

09:22.437 --> 09:23.646
- A while back.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.690
At the height of the pandemic,
she reached out.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.276
- Why is that?
- She was lonely.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.028
That was the last time
we spoke.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.821
- Yeah, we're not buying a word
of this nonsense.

09:31.863 --> 09:35.158
Phone records show that you
and Dana exchanged phone calls

09:35.200 --> 09:37.285
as recently as three days ago.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.828
- Excuse me.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.206
- Oh, sorry.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.667
- What's going on?
- It's all right, honey.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.293
These men are just leaving.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.296
[tense music]

09:48.338 --> 09:52.926
* *

09:52.967 --> 09:54.260
- Well,
he's lying through his teeth.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.471
- Yeah, we got enough
for a search warrant.

09:56.513 --> 09:59.015
Let's get patrol
to come seal off the location.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.602
- Whoa, whoa. Hold up.

10:02.644 --> 10:04.396
- What you got?

10:04.437 --> 10:11.236
* *

10:14.322 --> 10:15.865
- Does that look like silk
to you?

10:15.907 --> 10:18.868
Maroon, blue, and white
like the ME said.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.078
- Uh-huh.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.996
- What are you
still doing here?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.082
- Sir, you mind
stepping outside?

10:24.124 --> 10:26.334
Just step outside.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.585
Let's go.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.421
We need to talk to you
down at the precinct.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.173
* *

10:40.265 --> 10:40.473
.

10:40.515 --> 10:41.433
- I've never seen
that scarf before.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.937
- We found it in your trash.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.731
- I didn't kill Dana.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.566
I would never do something
like that, ever!

10:49.607 --> 10:50.817
- So why did you lie to us

10:50.859 --> 10:52.652
about being on the phone
with her recently?

10:52.694 --> 10:54.362
We have the phone records.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.322
- I just got married.

10:56.364 --> 10:58.199
I didn't want my wife
to find out.

10:58.241 --> 11:00.660
She gets jealous
of ex-girlfriends,

11:00.702 --> 11:01.828
especially Dana.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.747
- Still doesn't explain why

11:03.788 --> 11:06.833
you were on the phone
with Dana recently.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.543
- She was having
money problems.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.836
- So she hit you up for money?

11:09.878 --> 11:11.838
- Yes, which was concerning

11:11.880 --> 11:13.882
because she never asks
for help.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.217
She solves everyone else's
problems, you know?

11:16.259 --> 11:18.678
So I knew that she was
in some real trouble.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.180
- Did you lend her any money?

11:20.221 --> 11:22.390
- No, I was trying
to figure out a way

11:22.432 --> 11:24.309
to broach the subject
with my wife, but--

11:24.351 --> 11:27.729
- That still does not explain
the scarf,

11:27.771 --> 11:32.692
the murder weapon that we found
outside of your house.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.028
- If I really killed her
with that scarf,

11:35.070 --> 11:36.863
would I be stupid enough
to just toss it

11:36.905 --> 11:38.782
on the top of a damn trash bin?

11:41.201 --> 11:43.203
- Ay, forensics
and the scarf came back.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.581
So Dana Clarkson's DNA
and blood are all over it,

11:46.623 --> 11:48.375
but no trace of Dr. Royce.

11:48.416 --> 11:51.461
- And his story about
Dana's financials checks out.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.837
She was underwater.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.172
Bank account was near zero,

11:54.214 --> 11:55.840
mortgage was 90 days
delinquent,

11:55.882 --> 11:58.218
and she owed over 200,000
in credit cards.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.053
- But she was successful,
right?

12:00.095 --> 12:01.554
I mean,
she had a thriving business.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.639
- Sure looked that way.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.057
- So where'd all the money go?

12:04.099 --> 12:05.225
She have an addiction?

12:05.266 --> 12:07.936
Drugs, gambling,
private planes maybe?

12:07.977 --> 12:09.437
- No indication
of anything like that,

12:09.479 --> 12:11.189
but a few hours
before the murder,

12:11.231 --> 12:12.649
her credit card was frozen.

12:12.691 --> 12:17.779
A dinner charge was declined
for 3,700 at Chez Roget.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.489
Check out the time
of the charge.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.241
- 9:17 p.m.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.619
- That is about the time
she was in Mark Zanford's car.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.955
- Cannot be in two places
at once.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.915
- You better shine your shoes,
fellas.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.041
You're about to go
to a restaurant

12:30.083 --> 12:33.420
that charges $3,700 for dinner.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.296
- [whistles]

12:37.298 --> 12:39.259
- No,
she doesn't look familiar.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.635
- You remember
a card being declined

12:40.677 --> 12:42.345
for a $3,700 dinner?

12:42.387 --> 12:44.848
- I do, but it was a man
using the card.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.016
- What was his name?

12:46.057 --> 12:49.477
- Uh,
his name was Dana Clarkson.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.856
- If the card was declined,

12:52.897 --> 12:54.941
who ended up paying the bill?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.027
- The woman he was with.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.195
- Can I have her name?

12:59.237 --> 13:01.948
- Our regulars rely
on our discretion.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.658
- Yeah,
we're homicide detectives,

13:03.700 --> 13:05.160
not gossip columnists.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.873
- Grace Pollard.

13:09.914 --> 13:10.915
- The lawyer?

13:10.957 --> 13:13.835
[suspenseful music]

13:13.877 --> 13:16.463
Huh.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.298
- I know who she is.

13:18.340 --> 13:25.221
* *

13:25.263 --> 13:28.016
- Two nights ago,
you had dinner at Chez Roget.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.809
Your companion's credit card
was declined,

13:29.851 --> 13:31.519
and you ended up
paying the bill.

13:31.561 --> 13:33.188
Can you tell us
who you were with?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.065
- Unfortunately,
I can't even confirm

13:35.106 --> 13:36.524
I was at that restaurant.

13:36.566 --> 13:38.485
- Miss Pollard, the man
you were having dinner with

13:38.526 --> 13:40.320
tried to use the credit card
of a woman

13:40.362 --> 13:42.614
who was found strangled
and beaten to death

13:42.655 --> 13:44.866
less than two hours later.

13:49.788 --> 13:52.040
- Are you asserting
attorney-client privilege?

13:52.082 --> 13:53.958
- I can neither affirm
nor deny,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.169
and if you don't have
a warrant,

13:56.211 --> 13:58.380
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

13:58.421 --> 14:05.345
* *

14:06.888 --> 14:08.848
- Why the hell
would Grace Pollard

14:08.890 --> 14:10.517
stonewall
a homicide investigation?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.852
- Maybe she was with a client,
trying to protect him.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.646
From what is the question.

14:14.688 --> 14:15.939
- We could get a subpoena,

14:15.980 --> 14:17.440
force her to give it up
in the grand jury.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.025
- No, no,
she would rather go to jail

14:19.067 --> 14:20.318
than break confidentiality.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.028
- Yeah, as long as the media
covers her story.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.071
- Hold on a second.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.365
This woman has done a lot
of good.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.909
She's responsible
for getting date rape codified

14:27.951 --> 14:29.619
as a felony.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.204
She's a pioneer.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.747
She's been leading the charge
for women

14:32.789 --> 14:36.084
long before any of us even knew
about Me Too or Time's Up.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.919
- Fair enough.
- No arguments. She's a boss.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.504
[knock at door]
- Hey. I got something--

14:39.546 --> 14:41.381
security footage
from outside the restaurant

14:41.423 --> 14:43.800
about 15 minutes
after the card was declined.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.511
- Can you punch in
on that face?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.138
- I can send it to FAS
for facial rec.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.222
- Don't bother.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.557
- It's the guy who had lunch

14:50.598 --> 14:51.474
with Dana Clarkson,

14:51.516 --> 14:53.518
the college friend from Zurich.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.895
- Pierre Briones.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.064
- I'll check for an address.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.901
Here he is, Pierre Briones.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.571
Rents a townhouse
on 38th and 3rd.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.406
- That's three blocks
from the murder.

15:06.448 --> 15:13.371
* *

15:15.206 --> 15:16.666
This guy wasn't visiting
from Zurich.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.335
He lives here.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.050
- Hey, Detective,
come look at this.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.468
- What you got?

15:29.387 --> 15:30.972
Nice work.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.645
Thank you.

15:42.734 --> 15:43.985
Andrew Hilton.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.158
Julian Matias.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.789
Vincent Balanza.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.665
Jeez.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.504
Dana Clarkson's
bank account info.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.423
Bag all this.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.013
This guy's got more passports
than James Bond.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.431
He's got a pile
of Dana Clarkson's

16:13.473 --> 16:15.975
financial records,
credit card applications,

16:16.017 --> 16:17.727
loan information,
all in her name.

16:17.769 --> 16:18.937
- Wow, this guy's a real pro.

16:18.978 --> 16:19.938
- Yeah, he is.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.981
[both laugh]

16:22.023 --> 16:24.984
[tense music]

16:25.026 --> 16:27.487
Stop, police!

16:27.529 --> 16:34.452
* *

16:41.876 --> 16:43.169
[car horn honks]
- [grunts]

16:43.211 --> 16:45.213
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

16:45.255 --> 16:52.387
* *

16:56.266 --> 16:59.352
[car horns and alarms blaring]

17:14.909 --> 17:17.829
[both grunting]

17:19.497 --> 17:21.041
- [groans]

17:21.082 --> 17:24.085
- Pierre Briones,
you're under arrest

17:24.127 --> 17:25.420
for the murder
of Dana Clarkson.

17:25.462 --> 17:26.755
- Too bad she's gone.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.673
You could use
a good crisis manager.

17:34.596 --> 17:34.971
.

17:35.013 --> 17:35.847
- Calling docket ending
in 9604,

17:37.223 --> 17:40.685
People v. Pierre Briones,
also known as Julian Matias,

17:40.727 --> 17:44.314
also known as Andrew Hilton,
also known as Vincent Balanza,

17:44.356 --> 17:46.358
also known as--
- What's his actual name?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.902
- The defendant's true name
is Devon Miller.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.279
- Mr. Miller pleads not guilty.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.031
- I assume the people
are seeking remand?

17:53.073 --> 17:55.367
- He's the very definition
of a flight risk.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.119
He has eight aliases
and nine dates of birth.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.038
- My client has never been
convicted of a crime.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.248
In fact, he's never even been
arrested before.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.625
- I'll hear your argument,
Ms. Maroun.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.502
- The people's theory
is that the defendant

18:05.543 --> 18:07.962
romanced the victim,
Dana Clarkson,

18:08.004 --> 18:10.632
conned her out of almost
$1/2 million,

18:10.674 --> 18:12.967
and when she found out,
he killed her.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.011
The victim's body
was found three blocks

18:15.053 --> 18:16.221
from Mr. Miller's home.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.223
He lied to police
about both the nature

18:18.264 --> 18:20.392
of their relationship
and his true identity,

18:20.433 --> 18:23.812
and his DNA was found under
Ms. Clarkson's fingernails.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.189
- The DNA merely proves
there was physical contact

18:26.231 --> 18:27.941
sometime that day.

18:27.982 --> 18:29.401
And the prosecutor failed
to mention

18:29.442 --> 18:31.945
that the murder weapon was
found at another man's home.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.324
- Sounds like the people have
their work cut out for them.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.702
Bail is set at $1 million.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.995
[suspenseful music]

18:41.037 --> 18:43.123
- Uh, one sec.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.919
Thank you so much.
Appreciate it.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.087
Yeah, I mean...

18:49.129 --> 18:51.214
- Mr. Miller
will post bail forthwith.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.594
- He's got profiles
on four dating sites

18:56.636 --> 18:59.305
mostly catered to older,
affluent singles.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.392
- And the two women
we know he's dated

19:02.434 --> 19:05.770
are both sophisticated,
intelligent women.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.230
- It's not about intelligence.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.816
He's an emotional predator.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.610
Thank God
I'm in a relationship.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.696
- Lucky you.

19:14.738 --> 19:18.158
It's--it's hard meeting people
these days.

19:18.199 --> 19:22.037
[chuckles]
Online dating is a nightmare.

19:22.078 --> 19:23.747
- That's how I met my partner.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.958
It's a numbers game, but you
have to put yourself out there.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.127
- Oh, I put myself out there.

19:29.169 --> 19:32.088
I met my first husband
the old-fashioned way,

19:32.130 --> 19:34.466
drunk as hell at a biker bar
in Queens.

19:34.507 --> 19:38.803
And then my second husband
I met through mutual friends.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.305
I'm single now.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.557
I did get the Financial Frauds
report back,

19:42.599 --> 19:46.061
and this guy has conned
a slew of women.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.604
He's run up their credit cards.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.523
He persuaded them
to get car loans, mortgages,

19:50.565 --> 19:52.609
to wire money into his account.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.528
And judging by all the timing
of these transactions,

19:55.570 --> 19:57.822
he's just using one woman
to pay for the next.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.200
- Wasn't he having dinner
with that lawyer Grace Pollard?

20:00.241 --> 20:01.910
- Yeah.
- You think it was a date?

20:01.951 --> 20:02.994
- Possibly.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.412
I mean, we tried
to question her,

20:04.454 --> 20:06.373
and she invoked
attorney-client privilege.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.541
- I followed up.
She refused to speak with me,

20:08.583 --> 20:11.378
so I issued a subpoena,
but she got it quashed.

20:11.419 --> 20:14.839
- Look, we will get you a list
of all his other victims.

20:14.881 --> 20:17.300
- Thank you.
- All right.

20:17.342 --> 20:20.011
- None of the victims
are willing to testify.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.513
- Subpoena them.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.349
- These women were conned,
but they're not stupid.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.975
We force them on the stand,
they'll refuse

20:26.017 --> 20:27.352
to admit they were duped.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.312
- The financial records
will refute that.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.605
We have documents.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.357
We have evidence
that shows he has their money.

20:32.399 --> 20:33.608
- They'll call it a loan,

20:33.650 --> 20:36.778
say they expect him
to pay them back.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.780
Good news is,
we have a clear motive.

20:38.822 --> 20:41.241
Dana Clarkson was planning
to expose Miller.

20:41.282 --> 20:42.826
[phone vibrates]

20:43.910 --> 20:45.870
- What?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.288
- Miller just fired his lawyer.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.832
He's gonna represent himself.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.384
- This is a thinly veiled
attempt

20:59.426 --> 21:00.885
to manipulate the process.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.596
The defendant is trying
to create an appealable issue.

21:03.638 --> 21:05.890
If he's convicted,
he'll ask for a new trial,

21:05.932 --> 21:07.726
claiming ineffective counsel.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.769
- Also going pro se
allows the defendant

21:09.811 --> 21:12.564
to cross-examine
and intimidate our witnesses.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.858
- It also allows him
to speak directly to the jury

21:14.899 --> 21:16.067
without being placed under oath

21:16.109 --> 21:17.777
or being subject
to cross-examination,

21:17.819 --> 21:20.613
which means he can say whatever
he wants with no repercussions.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.574
- So what are you asking me
to do?

21:22.615 --> 21:25.577
- To appoint stand-by counsel,
a lawyer who is required

21:25.618 --> 21:27.495
to comply with the rules
of professional responsibility

21:27.537 --> 21:29.414
who Ms. Maroun and I
can confer with.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.999
- What do you say about that,
Mr. Miller?

21:31.041 --> 21:32.417
- They can confer with me.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.336
I am happy to confer.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.171
And I should be able
to handle the rules of evidence

21:36.212 --> 21:38.131
as I did graduate
summa cum laude

21:38.173 --> 21:40.967
from Harvard College, and then
I went to Columbia Law School,

21:41.009 --> 21:42.844
so I should be fine.

21:42.886 --> 21:45.096
- He was expelled from Columbia
for cheating.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.639
- Excuse me.
The Sixth Amendment

21:46.681 --> 21:48.475
to the United States
Constitution

21:48.516 --> 21:51.353
affords me the right
to represent myself.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.608
- Okay, Mr. Miller.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.360
I'm allowing your application.

21:58.401 --> 22:01.363
You may act as your own lawyer.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.864
- Thank you, Your Honor.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.825
[tense music]

22:05.867 --> 22:09.704
* *

22:16.169 --> 22:16.378
.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.420
- The defendant preyed
on intelligent,

22:19.714 --> 22:22.008
accomplished women,

22:22.050 --> 22:25.011
women who worked hard
to earn their money,

22:25.053 --> 22:27.722
but also their reputation.

22:27.764 --> 22:31.101
And who would rather face
financial ruin

22:31.142 --> 22:34.729
than go public and report what
had happened to them.

22:34.771 --> 22:38.358
But he underestimated
Dana Clarkson,

22:38.400 --> 22:43.279
a crisis manager who was
determined to expose him

22:43.321 --> 22:45.740
and make him pay
for what he had done.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.992
On the day of the murder,

22:48.034 --> 22:49.369
Ms. Clarkson met
with the defendant

22:49.411 --> 22:52.747
at Soho House for lunch,
demanding her money back.

22:52.789 --> 22:55.625
He made empty promises
to repay her,

22:55.667 --> 22:58.461
but later that night,

22:58.503 --> 23:00.422
when Ms. Clarkson discovered

23:00.463 --> 23:03.133
that he was still using
her credit card,

23:03.174 --> 23:05.719
she went to his home
to confront him.

23:05.760 --> 23:07.762
And in response,

23:07.804 --> 23:11.182
he savagely beat

23:11.224 --> 23:15.270
and strangled her to death.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.354
Don't be fooled

23:16.396 --> 23:19.816
by the defendant's
charming demeanor.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.401
After you've heard
all the evidence,

23:21.443 --> 23:24.738
you will learn
what Dana Clarkson learned

23:24.779 --> 23:26.114
the hard way...

23:28.908 --> 23:29.993
He's a con man.

23:32.787 --> 23:35.415
And a cold-blooded killer.

23:42.797 --> 23:45.467
- Hi. Good morning.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.552
[exhales]

23:47.594 --> 23:50.847
I'm not a big-shot lawyer
like Mr. Price over there.

23:53.975 --> 23:55.935
And I'm fighting for my life.

23:55.977 --> 23:59.105
So please, I just ask,
be patient with me.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.524
I loved Dana Clarkson.

24:01.566 --> 24:03.777
I loved her.
She was a beautiful person,

24:03.818 --> 24:04.986
inside and out.

24:05.028 --> 24:07.614
Brilliant. Talented.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.949
So please, I just ask,
let's not speak of her

24:09.991 --> 24:10.950
like she's some piece
of evidence

24:10.992 --> 24:12.369
in this sham of a trial.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.126
Look, I didn't kill Dana.

24:20.168 --> 24:22.796
I would never, ever hurt her.

24:22.837 --> 24:25.131
Yes,
I saw her the day she died.

24:25.173 --> 24:27.133
Lots of people saw her
after our lunch.

24:27.175 --> 24:29.302
Any one of them could have
harmed her.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.638
She spent the evening
with the notoriously volatile

24:31.680 --> 24:34.015
tech mogul Mark Zanford.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.101
Maybe he killed her.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.978
Or it could have been
her abusive ex-boyfriend.

24:39.020 --> 24:41.272
Police found the murder weapon
at his home.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.565
[laughs]

24:44.109 --> 24:46.569
But it's not my job
to figure out who killed Dana.

24:46.611 --> 24:48.655
I have news for you:
it's not your job either.

24:48.697 --> 24:51.491
You know whose job it is?

24:51.533 --> 24:53.368
His.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.703
The prosecutor's.

24:54.744 --> 24:57.122
[tense music]

24:57.163 --> 24:59.749
And you'll see he has
fabricated a case against me.

24:59.791 --> 25:01.751
Mm.

25:01.793 --> 25:04.963
A case full of gaping holes.

25:05.005 --> 25:08.591
And in so doing,
he has deprived Dana Clarkson,

25:08.633 --> 25:13.930
my Dana, of the justice
and respect she deserves.

25:15.974 --> 25:18.685
Thank you.

25:18.727 --> 25:23.106
* *

25:23.148 --> 25:26.234
- Mr. Price, you may call
your first witness.

25:26.276 --> 25:27.861
- People call
Detective Jalen Shaw.

25:27.902 --> 25:29.904
- Objection.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.031
- What's the objection?
[laughs]

25:31.072 --> 25:32.782
Witness hasn't even taken
the stand yet.

25:32.824 --> 25:35.452
- Detective Shaw's testimony
should be excluded.

25:35.493 --> 25:37.537
I was never advised
of my Miranda rights.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.873
- The time for a motion
to suppress hearing

25:39.914 --> 25:41.666
has long passed.

25:44.502 --> 25:45.920
- I agree

25:45.962 --> 25:49.257
under normal circumstances.

25:49.299 --> 25:52.635
But since Mr. Miller
is a pro se defendant,

25:52.677 --> 25:56.598
I have no choice
but to allow some latitude.

25:56.639 --> 25:59.559
I'm excusing the jury while
we hold an evidentiary hearing.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.438
- Thank you so much,
Your Honor.

26:03.480 --> 26:10.403
* *

26:14.199 --> 26:16.701
- Detective Cosgrove and I
spoke to Mr. Miller

26:16.743 --> 26:17.994
for about 20 minutes.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.913
- Can you characterize
the conversation?

26:19.954 --> 26:21.373
- It was cordial.

26:21.414 --> 26:22.874
- The defendant lied to you.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.417
- He did.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.795
He said his name
was Pierre Briones,

26:26.836 --> 26:28.505
that he lived in Zurich,

26:28.546 --> 26:31.841
that he and Dana Clarkson
were old college friends,

26:31.883 --> 26:34.260
and that he was gay.

26:34.302 --> 26:36.137
- Thank you. Nothing further.

26:38.139 --> 26:40.266
- There were two of you, yeah?

26:40.308 --> 26:41.976
- I was with my partner,
correct.

26:42.018 --> 26:43.186
- Both of you were carrying

26:43.228 --> 26:46.690
fully loaded
automatic handguns, yeah?

26:46.731 --> 26:48.483
- We were on duty.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.818
- You ambushed me.

26:49.859 --> 26:52.487
You told me I wasn't free
to leave, didn't you?

26:52.529 --> 26:53.613
- Absolutely not.

26:53.655 --> 26:54.656
- No, no. I stood up.

26:54.698 --> 26:56.116
I asked to consult
with an attorney.

26:56.157 --> 26:57.909
You told me to sit down,

26:57.951 --> 27:00.328
that I wasn't "going anywhere"
till you were done.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.996
- That never happened.

27:02.038 --> 27:03.581
- You grilled me
for over an hour.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.333
- If you're gonna let
the defendant testify,

27:05.375 --> 27:06.876
can we at least place him
under oath?

27:06.918 --> 27:08.795
- Sit down, Mr. Price.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.381
- You violated my rights
under Miranda v. Arizona.

27:11.423 --> 27:13.550
Your Honor, I request
that you allow my application

27:13.591 --> 27:15.218
to suppress.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.886
- The burden falls
on the prosecution.

27:16.928 --> 27:19.472
You should have videotaped
the defendant's statement.

27:19.514 --> 27:22.017
- He wasn't even a suspect
at the time.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.603
- I'm granting
the defendant's application.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.481
- Thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you.

27:35.697 --> 27:38.116
- So you can't tell the jury
about Miller's lies

27:38.158 --> 27:39.576
to the detectives,

27:39.617 --> 27:42.245
but you should be able
to prove your case.

27:42.287 --> 27:43.872
- Well, it's not just the lies.

27:43.913 --> 27:46.666
He'll explain away the DNA
found under her nails

27:46.708 --> 27:49.169
with a false claim
that she touched his arm

27:49.210 --> 27:50.503
earlier in the day.

27:50.545 --> 27:53.131
And we don't have
any other women

27:53.173 --> 27:56.343
to show that he has a pattern
of fraud.

27:56.384 --> 27:57.844
- You're telling me
if the case were to go

27:57.886 --> 27:59.554
to the jury today, you'd lose?

27:59.596 --> 28:01.681
- We might not even make it
over the rail.

28:01.723 --> 28:05.101
Judge could dismiss it outright
for lack of evidence.

28:06.561 --> 28:08.355
- Sounds like
he's playing the judge and jury

28:08.396 --> 28:10.106
the way he played your victim.

28:10.148 --> 28:12.442
- Just about sums it up.

28:12.484 --> 28:16.279
And if he's acquitted,
he'll be right back at it.

28:16.321 --> 28:17.530
- You need to pivot.

28:17.572 --> 28:20.700
Link Miller
to the murder weapon.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.203
Put the scarf in his hands.
- Tried.

28:23.244 --> 28:24.829
No one saw him plant it.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.289
We checked surveillance video,

28:26.331 --> 28:29.417
subpoenaed GPS
in his car and phone.

28:29.459 --> 28:32.045
- Focus on the scarf,
not the defendant.

28:32.087 --> 28:35.173
If the fabric is as rare
and expensive

28:35.215 --> 28:37.050
as forensics indicate,

28:37.092 --> 28:38.968
only a handful
of stores sell it.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.762
Find out where he bought it.

28:42.764 --> 28:45.308
- Men like Miller don't buy
their own luxury items.

28:45.350 --> 28:48.353
- Then track down whoever
bought it for him.

28:54.109 --> 28:57.696
- I can prove
you bought the scarf.

28:57.737 --> 29:00.573
Sales clerk remembers
selling it to you.

29:00.615 --> 29:02.200
I have a video of you
in the store,

29:02.242 --> 29:03.993
and I have your credit card
statement.

29:04.035 --> 29:06.329
- It was a client gift.

29:06.371 --> 29:07.831
- We both know
that's not the nature

29:07.872 --> 29:09.290
of your relationship.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.626
You bought it
on Valentine's Day.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.629
I know this must be difficult.

29:14.671 --> 29:17.382
- You have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:18.758 --> 29:22.012
If you call me to testify,
I will assert privilege.

29:22.053 --> 29:24.264
- I'll challenge it and win.

29:24.305 --> 29:26.433
- I'll take the Fifth.
- I'll immunize you.

29:26.474 --> 29:28.810
- And if I refuse to comply?

29:32.022 --> 29:33.898
- Every survivor,

29:33.940 --> 29:37.569
every prosecutor in the country
owes you a debt of gratitude

29:37.610 --> 29:40.030
for all that you've done
to give a voice

29:40.071 --> 29:41.740
to sexual assault victims,

29:41.781 --> 29:44.367
promote equal pay
for equal work,

29:44.409 --> 29:47.912
women's healthcare, Title IX.

29:47.954 --> 29:52.459
But you're an essential witness
in a murder case,

29:52.500 --> 29:55.378
in the murder of another woman.

29:55.420 --> 29:58.381
And you and you alone
can put the murder weapon

29:58.423 --> 30:00.633
in the defendant's hands.

30:00.675 --> 30:03.678
- My detractors
have been searching

30:03.720 --> 30:07.807
for a way to undermine me
and the causes that I champion

30:07.849 --> 30:10.018
for years.

30:10.060 --> 30:14.356
You are handing it to them
on a silver platter.

30:14.397 --> 30:16.941
- People will understand.

30:16.983 --> 30:21.863
You were looking for connection
and companionship.

30:21.905 --> 30:23.615
[suspenseful music]

30:23.656 --> 30:26.117
That doesn't make you weak.

30:26.159 --> 30:27.494
It makes you human.

30:27.535 --> 30:32.707
- I'm begging you,
Ms. Maroun...

30:32.749 --> 30:37.170
if you believe in the women
that I have helped,

30:37.212 --> 30:40.423
put your money
where your mouth is

30:40.465 --> 30:44.260
and do not put me
on the witness stand.

30:44.302 --> 30:50.684
* *

30:56.398 --> 30:56.773
.

30:56.815 --> 30:57.607
- Grace Pollard, of all people,

30:58.817 --> 31:00.318
should be leading the charge,

31:00.360 --> 31:02.904
helping us send Devon Miller
to prison.

31:02.946 --> 31:04.406
- Her ego is getting
in the way.

31:04.447 --> 31:06.074
- No, it's about legacy,

31:06.116 --> 31:08.702
preserving all the causes
she's advanced.

31:08.743 --> 31:10.745
- And therefore,
I hope you're not suggesting

31:10.787 --> 31:12.747
we dismiss a murder charge.

31:12.789 --> 31:14.207
- We could offer a plea.

31:14.249 --> 31:15.917
Man One, 15 years.

31:15.959 --> 31:18.712
Miller goes to prison.

31:18.753 --> 31:20.505
Grace Pollard
retains her reputation.

31:20.547 --> 31:23.299
- Murder trumps humiliation.

31:23.341 --> 31:26.344
Grace Pollard and her causes
will recover.

31:26.386 --> 31:28.096
- Easy for you to say.

31:28.138 --> 31:29.097
- Excuse me?

31:29.139 --> 31:30.765
- Men bounce back
from scandals,

31:30.807 --> 31:32.267
not women.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.394
You have no idea
how hard she had to fight

31:34.436 --> 31:35.979
to accomplish what she has.

31:36.021 --> 31:38.314
This will stain her
and all she's fought for.

31:38.356 --> 31:40.859
It'll be the excuse not
to take her

31:40.900 --> 31:43.737
or her causes seriously.

31:43.778 --> 31:46.239
- I hear you.

31:46.281 --> 31:50.368
But Grace Pollard is gonna have
to testify.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.829
Subpoena her if necessary.

31:57.584 --> 31:58.835
- Ms. Pollard,
were you involved

31:58.877 --> 32:00.962
in a romantic relationship
with the defendant?

32:01.004 --> 32:02.630
- Your Honor,
I'd object to that question

32:02.672 --> 32:04.341
as being overly broad.

32:04.382 --> 32:06.801
- Ms. Pollard,
please leave the objections

32:06.843 --> 32:08.720
to counsel on the case.

32:08.762 --> 32:10.638
- And who's representing
my interests?

32:10.680 --> 32:12.140
The people certainly aren't.

32:12.182 --> 32:15.060
- I'm instructing you
to answer the question.

32:18.605 --> 32:20.607
- We were involved briefly,
yes.

32:20.648 --> 32:21.649
- For about ten months,
correct?

32:21.691 --> 32:22.817
- Approximately.

32:22.859 --> 32:24.778
- You ever loan him money?

32:24.819 --> 32:26.363
- I'm out somewhere
in the neighborhood

32:26.404 --> 32:28.782
of $200,000.

32:30.408 --> 32:31.701
Did you ever give him gifts?

32:31.743 --> 32:33.661
- Let's just cut to the chase,
shall we?

32:33.703 --> 32:36.081
I gave him a silk scarf.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.085
- This silk scarf?

32:40.126 --> 32:40.960
- Yes.

32:41.002 --> 32:44.923
Was this in his possession

32:44.964 --> 32:46.466
the night
of Dana Clarkson's murder?

32:46.508 --> 32:48.593
- It was.

32:48.635 --> 32:51.012
- Thank you.

32:57.727 --> 32:59.813
- [exhales]

32:59.854 --> 33:01.064
Hi, Grace.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.194
You were in my brownstone

33:06.236 --> 33:08.613
the night Dana Clarkson
was murdered, weren't you?

33:08.655 --> 33:10.573
- Objection. No foundation.

33:10.615 --> 33:11.866
- Overruled.

33:11.908 --> 33:15.203
[tense music]

33:15.245 --> 33:17.580
- I was.

33:17.622 --> 33:23.211
- You heard Dana bang
on the door, call my name?

33:23.253 --> 33:24.879
- I did.

33:24.921 --> 33:27.340
- An old flame had reappeared
in my life,

33:27.382 --> 33:30.677
and you were
understandably angry,

33:30.719 --> 33:31.970
maybe even jealous?

33:32.012 --> 33:33.221
- Your Honor,
he's badgering the witness.

33:33.263 --> 33:35.056
Can he step away
from the witness box?

33:35.098 --> 33:36.599
- Step back, Mr. Miller.

33:36.641 --> 33:38.393
- Yeah, of course.

33:38.435 --> 33:40.603
Sorry.

33:41.438 --> 33:44.733
- I wish I'd have known
who you really are.

33:44.774 --> 33:47.694
- Mm-hmm, you were so angry,
in fact,

33:47.736 --> 33:50.739
that you grabbed that scarf
and ran out the door.

33:50.780 --> 33:52.032
- That's a lie.
- Objection.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.742
- That's just--
- You killed Dana Clarks--

33:53.783 --> 33:55.243
- That is absurd!
- Your Honor--

33:55.285 --> 33:56.536
Your Honor!
- Didn't you?

33:56.578 --> 33:58.747
- That is--that is--
- All right, all right.

33:58.788 --> 34:01.833
Let's everybody calm down.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.585
You have anything to back
that up, Mr. Miller?

34:03.626 --> 34:04.669
- I do, actually.

34:04.711 --> 34:06.421
Yeah, I have a tape.

34:06.463 --> 34:08.423
- I--I have never heard
about a tape.

34:08.465 --> 34:09.966
This violates the rules
of discovery

34:10.008 --> 34:12.427
and it's unfair surprise.

34:12.469 --> 34:16.598
- I will see you all
in my chambers now.

34:16.639 --> 34:20.935
* *

34:20.977 --> 34:23.104
- A sex tape, are you serious?

34:23.146 --> 34:24.773
- How is that even
remotely relevant?

34:24.814 --> 34:26.524
- It was taken in my home.

34:26.566 --> 34:29.277
It puts Ms. Pollard right near
the scene of the crime,

34:29.319 --> 34:30.904
and it goes to her state
of mind at the time,

34:30.945 --> 34:32.947
which you'll see from the tape,

34:32.989 --> 34:34.074
she was in a rage.

34:34.115 --> 34:37.035
I mean, angry enough to kill.

34:38.328 --> 34:40.455
- Play it.
- Your Honor, I object.

34:40.497 --> 34:42.999
- I wanna see if it has any
evidentiary value.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.626
Play the tape.

34:44.668 --> 34:45.794
- There you go.

34:45.835 --> 34:47.921
Take off your blouse.
- [sighs]

34:47.962 --> 34:49.964
- Yes, sir.

34:50.006 --> 34:51.007
Tell me what you want.

34:51.049 --> 34:52.384
- Don't talk.

34:52.425 --> 34:53.426
Get on the bed.

34:53.468 --> 34:55.512
[both moan]

34:55.553 --> 34:57.305
[knock at door]
Ah, who's that?

34:57.347 --> 34:59.307
- Pierre,
I know you're in there.

34:59.349 --> 35:00.433
- It's an ex, okay?
Don't worry.

35:00.475 --> 35:02.268
- Get rid of her.
- Open the door!

35:02.310 --> 35:03.561
- Get her the hell out of--

35:03.603 --> 35:06.398
- This tape is a pretext
to publicly shame a woman

35:06.439 --> 35:09.734
for being vulnerable, intimate,
for--for trusting someone.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.695
Are you really gonna allow
that tape to be aired

35:11.736 --> 35:12.779
in your courtroom?

35:12.821 --> 35:15.031
- Watch yourself, Ms. Maroun.

35:15.073 --> 35:16.991
I find the tape
to be exculpatory,

35:17.033 --> 35:20.245
and distasteful as I find it,

35:20.286 --> 35:22.163
I'm granting you your request.

35:22.205 --> 35:23.915
- Thank you.
- But I warn you,

35:23.957 --> 35:25.375
tread lightly.

35:28.253 --> 35:31.214
- If you didn't consent
to the recording,

35:31.256 --> 35:33.341
I can go back in there,
ask the judge to suppress it.

35:33.383 --> 35:40.265
* *

35:40.306 --> 35:44.269
Well, he's not allowed
to play the entire tape.

35:44.310 --> 35:49.107
It will be limited in scope.
- I am half-naked, Mr. Price,

35:49.149 --> 35:51.985
asking a man, that man,

35:52.027 --> 35:54.946
to take charge of my body.

35:58.116 --> 36:00.410
Do you understand how
that looks?

36:03.246 --> 36:06.541
- It looks like a woman engaged
in a consensual act,

36:06.583 --> 36:07.542
making a choice.

36:07.584 --> 36:09.377
- It will be my undoing.

36:09.419 --> 36:11.421
- The jury will see right
through his whole charade.

36:11.463 --> 36:16.885
- I've seen thousands of women
torn to shreds on the stand.

36:16.926 --> 36:20.221
It always comes down
to one thing:

36:20.263 --> 36:21.765
sex.

36:21.806 --> 36:24.601
- You've made a career out
of encouraging other women

36:24.642 --> 36:26.811
to stand up for themselves.

36:26.853 --> 36:29.189
Now that it's your turn, what,

36:29.230 --> 36:31.441
you're just gonna try
and look the other way?

36:34.861 --> 36:36.279
You can do this.

36:38.615 --> 36:40.492
- Judge is waiting.

36:40.533 --> 36:47.248
* *

36:47.290 --> 36:48.416
- It's an ex, okay?
Don't worry.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.335
- Get rid of her.
- Open the door!

36:50.377 --> 36:52.712
- Get her the hell out--
- Okay, all right.

36:58.134 --> 37:00.553
That was you on the tape?

37:00.595 --> 37:02.847
- You're trying
to slut-shame me, Mr. Miller?

37:02.889 --> 37:04.224
- I'll take that as a yes.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.267
- Okay, Mr. Miller.
Let's move on.

37:06.309 --> 37:08.395
- So you admit you were
in my home

37:08.436 --> 37:10.397
when Dana Clarkson was banging
on the door that night?

37:10.438 --> 37:13.024
- Yes, I was.
- And you were livid, correct?

37:13.066 --> 37:15.068
- No, I was annoyed.

37:15.110 --> 37:16.444
I wanted to have sex.

37:16.486 --> 37:19.823
[jurors mumbling indistinctly]
- Hmm.

37:19.864 --> 37:21.324
Nothing further.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.841
- What Mr. Miller just did
in this courtroom

37:37.882 --> 37:40.260
reveals who he is,

37:40.301 --> 37:42.679
not who you are,
isn't that true?

37:42.721 --> 37:45.598
- Objection! Leading.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.809
- Overruled.

37:47.851 --> 37:49.352
- Yes.

37:49.394 --> 37:52.313
He's a liar
and a ruthless sociopath

37:52.355 --> 37:53.940
with no regard for others.

37:53.982 --> 37:57.193
- And that sex tape
was a cheap ploy

37:57.235 --> 38:00.363
designed to intimidate you,
wasn't it?

38:00.405 --> 38:02.323
- If it was, it didn't work.

38:02.365 --> 38:04.075
- Mr. Miller tried
to demean you?

38:04.117 --> 38:09.247
- I will not be demeaned
for being a woman,

38:09.289 --> 38:13.251
for being a human, in full.

38:13.293 --> 38:15.003
At times, I'm a professional,

38:15.045 --> 38:16.671
at times, I'm a a friend,

38:16.713 --> 38:18.256
at times,

38:18.298 --> 38:24.095
I am a woman
seeking physical intimacy.

38:24.137 --> 38:27.015
When I fight for the rights
of women,

38:27.057 --> 38:28.308
I fight for their right

38:28.350 --> 38:31.519
to enjoy
the full human experience.

38:31.561 --> 38:35.523
It is what we all hope for
in life.

38:35.565 --> 38:42.489

38:47.077 --> 38:48.787
- Did you kill Dana Clarkson?

38:48.828 --> 38:50.705
- No, I did not.

38:50.747 --> 38:53.917
Mr. Miller killed her.

38:53.958 --> 38:56.211
- What makes you so sure?

38:56.252 --> 39:00.131
- He left the house
with the scarf.

39:00.173 --> 39:02.050
He was gone
for about 20 minutes.

39:02.092 --> 39:05.553
When he came back,
he was disheveled,

39:05.595 --> 39:08.348
and he poured himself
a tall glass of whiskey.

39:11.267 --> 39:15.897
- And why should
this jury believe you?

39:15.939 --> 39:17.982
- I'm sitting here,

39:18.024 --> 39:20.694
exposing
the most intimate details

39:20.735 --> 39:23.363
of my life.

I have everything to lose
and nothing to gain.

40:09.993 --> 40:11.661
- How do you find?

40:11.703 --> 40:14.289
- We find the defendant,
Devon Miller,

40:14.330 --> 40:16.875
guilty of murder
in the second degree.

That verdict was a referendum
