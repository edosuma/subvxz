00:01.479 --> 00:04.047
Previously onMom...You forgot to wear

00:04.091 --> 00:06.223
the only diamond earrings
you've ever had?

00:06.267 --> 00:08.399
Where was the last place
you saw them?

00:08.443 --> 00:09.487
In the middle of a poker table.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.098
Anything but seven.

00:12.751 --> 00:13.970
Seven out.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.451
No! That's my mom's bail money.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.801
I can give you a coupon
to the buffet.

00:18.844 --> 00:19.932
Can I bet it?

00:19.976 --> 00:21.325
The money's gone.

00:21.369 --> 00:22.587
Christy, it is time to admit

00:22.631 --> 00:24.676
you've got another problem.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.591
Why aren't you eating?

00:26.635 --> 00:29.246
I just came from a
Gamblers Anonymous meeting.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.379
Their food puts AA to shame.Hmm.

00:31.422 --> 00:35.165
One guy makes jambalaya
with his own alligator sausage.

00:35.209 --> 00:38.125
Oh, poor alligator.

00:38.168 --> 00:41.432
So you probably don't want to
hear about the baby lamb chops.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.347
I do not.

00:43.391 --> 00:45.784
But I'm glad GA's
working for you.

00:45.828 --> 00:49.049
The food's working, but I don't
know about the rest of it.

00:49.092 --> 00:52.052
Most of the shares are old guys
talking about horse racing,

00:52.095 --> 00:54.706
and the "good old days,"
when you could smoke inside.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.839
Those were good days, Christy.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.538
Damn, what I'd give
to finish my ciggy

01:00.582 --> 01:03.498
and stub it out
in these mashed potatoes.

01:03.541 --> 01:07.067
The thing is, in AA,
we give up drugs and alcohol

01:07.110 --> 01:10.505
'cause holy cow,
do we like drugs and alcohol.

01:10.548 --> 01:12.072
But in GA,

01:12.115 --> 01:14.291
I have to give up stuff I don't
even have a problem with.

01:14.335 --> 01:15.858
I can't play bingo.

01:15.901 --> 01:18.513
Bingo. How is that
gonna destroy my life?

01:18.556 --> 01:20.515
I lost an aunt to church bingo.

01:20.558 --> 01:22.517
There's a dark side
to that game.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.301
I'm not even
supposed to flip a coin,

01:24.345 --> 01:27.217
which frankly, is the only way
to get my mom to do anything.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.741
Look, you just got started
in GA.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.395
Y-You got to give it a chance.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.137
I didn't just start,
I got my 90 day key chain today.

01:34.181 --> 01:36.966
You did? Congratulations.

01:37.009 --> 01:39.534
For what?
When I got sober for 90 days,

01:39.577 --> 01:41.449
that was a huge accomplishment.

01:41.492 --> 01:43.146
I mean, I wanted a parade.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.452
And I'm not talking

01:44.495 --> 01:46.149
three Shriners in a convertible,

01:46.193 --> 01:49.065
I'm talking Al Roker pointing up
at a giant inflatable me.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.112
Sometimes I think your problem
is low self-esteem.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.896
Other times, not so much.

01:55.376 --> 01:58.161
Yeah, well,
I've made up my mind.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.555
I'm gonna stop going to GA.

02:00.598 --> 02:02.165
As it is,

02:02.209 --> 02:04.515
I don't even have time
for the things I need to do.

02:04.559 --> 02:05.951
Like what?

02:05.995 --> 02:08.476
Well, like...

02:11.696 --> 02:14.699
I just don't want to go anymore.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.574
BONNIE:
There she is.

02:19.617 --> 02:22.272
Show me that 90 day key chain.

02:22.316 --> 02:24.840
Yeah, Mom, about that.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.537
I think I'm actually
just gonna...

02:26.581 --> 02:29.975
ALL:
Surprise!

02:30.019 --> 02:32.108
Surprise.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.414
Oh, my God.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.416
We are so proud of you.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.244
You had a problem,
and you addressed it

02:37.287 --> 02:39.420
with another program.
It's inspiring.

02:39.463 --> 02:42.205
You guys, this is
so totally unnecessary.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.599
That's what I said. I mean,
when did we start doing this?

02:46.035 --> 02:49.473
Seriously, this girl sneezes,
and we throw her a party.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.432
Shush.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.216
I made a cake.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.218
You made that?

02:55.262 --> 02:57.612
You didn't just take it
out of Marjorie's hand

02:57.655 --> 02:58.874
when she walked in the door?

02:58.917 --> 03:02.312
I made it from scratch.

03:02.356 --> 03:04.358
Out of the box.

03:04.401 --> 03:07.970
Maybe I don't know
what scratch means.

03:08.013 --> 03:10.015
â™ª

03:29.905 --> 03:30.862
Let me get this straight.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.603
Your mom made you a cake,

03:32.647 --> 03:34.126
and that's gonna keep you
in Gamblers Anonymous?

03:34.170 --> 03:35.345
You don't understand.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.868
She has never baked me a cake.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.870
One birthday,
she gave me a martini olive

03:38.914 --> 03:40.524
with a candle in it.

03:40.568 --> 03:41.960
That's so sad.

03:42.004 --> 03:44.789
Not really,
I got a little buzz off it.

03:44.833 --> 03:48.880
I don't usually do this.
I'm gonna give you a hug.

03:48.924 --> 03:54.016
Aw. You're like a blanket
right out of the dryer.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.845
You know, if you're gonna
stick with GA,

03:56.888 --> 03:58.803
you might want to give it
an honest try.

03:58.847 --> 04:00.240
I've been trying.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.806
Oh. Have you shared?

04:01.850 --> 04:02.851
No.

04:02.894 --> 04:03.982
Have you made any friends?

04:04.026 --> 04:05.245
No.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.508
Do you have a sponsor?

04:07.551 --> 04:10.075
Stop trying to trick me,
just tell me what to do.

04:10.119 --> 04:12.077
Any of the three things
I just said.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.124
[sputters]

04:17.169 --> 04:21.173
Good Lord, it's like
a Sizzler up in there.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.747
Hi, I'm Christy.

04:29.791 --> 04:31.880
Lucy. How you doing?

04:31.923 --> 04:33.664
Okay, I guess.

04:33.708 --> 04:35.492
I'm looking for a sponsor.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.671
Geez, you mean me?

04:40.715 --> 04:43.674
I got three days.

04:43.718 --> 04:47.156
That new casino off
Highway 12 is killing me.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.940
I haven't been there.

04:48.984 --> 04:51.029
Oh, it's great.

04:51.073 --> 04:52.509
The chairs by the slots?

04:52.553 --> 04:54.076
Super comfortable.

04:54.119 --> 04:57.079
I don't even have to
bring my butt cushion.

04:57.122 --> 05:00.125
I'm gonna see if there's
any cornbread left.

05:00.169 --> 05:03.390
Good luck.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.695
I wouldn't shout "good luck"
in here.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.784
People get a little twitchy.

05:06.828 --> 05:09.396
Oh, right. Sorry.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.702
I'm kidding.
Hi, I'm Ned.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.051
Christy.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.749
Saw you take a
key chain yesterday.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.751
How's it going?

05:16.794 --> 05:18.274
Okay.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.190
I mean... I'm not sure.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.846
Can I be honest with you, Ned?

05:24.889 --> 05:26.369
I don't think I belong here.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.763
Want to bet?

05:28.806 --> 05:30.547
I'm serious.

05:30.591 --> 05:33.071
I've had three major
gambling incidents.

05:33.115 --> 05:36.205
Three times in my whole life.
Is that an addiction?

05:36.248 --> 05:39.774
'Cause if so, then I'm also
addicted to Intro to Algebra.

05:42.864 --> 05:44.431
Hey, Mr. Munson.
Whatcha doing?

05:44.474 --> 05:46.215
Waiting for my friend
who promised

05:46.258 --> 05:48.870
to take me
to my radiation treatment.

05:48.913 --> 05:52.395
Oh, God. What kind of heartless
friend forgets to...

05:56.486 --> 05:59.054
Oh, my God,
it's me, isn't it?

05:59.097 --> 06:00.925
I am so sorry.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.971
Time flies when you're hosing
out a dumpster.

06:03.014 --> 06:06.801
Can you give me, uh,
20 minutes to get cleaned up?

06:06.844 --> 06:09.978
Well, let me check
with my cancer.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.941
What do you think, boss?

06:18.900 --> 06:22.251
Mr. Prostate said we got to go.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.563
For years I was just
a racetrack guy.

06:29.606 --> 06:32.217
Then the racetrack opened
a poker club.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.785
Which was convenient,
until it cost me my job.

06:34.829 --> 06:38.006
But I figured, see,
that was a good thing,

06:38.049 --> 06:39.921
because it was obvious I was
gonna make more money gambling

06:39.964 --> 06:42.402
than I would selling
retractable canvas awnings.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.102
And then I took a second
mortgage out on the house,

06:47.145 --> 06:48.582
without telling my wife.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.018
And when you get away

06:50.061 --> 06:51.933
with a secret second mortgage,

06:51.976 --> 06:54.022
then it's obvious that
the universe is telling you

06:54.065 --> 06:56.241
to dip into your
daughter's college fund.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.723
Was that your bottom?

06:59.767 --> 07:01.333
[chuckles]:
No, no.

07:01.377 --> 07:02.857
That was a couple
of years later,

07:02.900 --> 07:04.641
when I was lying in the street

07:04.685 --> 07:07.992
with a broken kneecap and my
teeth scattered all around me.

07:08.036 --> 07:12.040
Yikes, I thought that only
happened in the movies.

07:12.083 --> 07:15.043
No, it also happens in Oakland.

07:15.086 --> 07:17.045
Um...

07:17.088 --> 07:22.267
One of my bookie's "colleagues"
beat me with a flashlight.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.052
And then he kicked me,
and he said,

07:24.095 --> 07:26.315
"You still owe us the money,"
which to me seemed,

07:26.358 --> 07:29.144
you know, a bit unfair.

07:29.187 --> 07:30.885
Wow.

07:30.928 --> 07:32.626
So I went to
a Gamblers Anonymous meeting

07:32.669 --> 07:34.018
before I even went
to the dentist, and of course,

07:34.062 --> 07:35.716
I should've
gone to the dentist first,

07:35.759 --> 07:38.196
because nobody could understand
a word I was saying.

07:40.503 --> 07:45.290
That was 22 year ago,
and, uh, it saved my life.

07:45.334 --> 07:47.510
See, that's the thing.

07:47.554 --> 07:51.166
I sit in meetings and hear story
after story like yours,

07:51.209 --> 07:54.517
but I don't relate to any of it.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.476
My gambling looked
nothing like that.

07:56.519 --> 07:59.000
Well, there are two types
of gamblers.

07:59.043 --> 08:01.437
There are cucumbers
and there are pickles.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.395
A cucumber goes

08:03.439 --> 08:05.528
to Vegas and loses
a little money

08:05.572 --> 08:07.095
or maybe even a lot of money,

08:07.138 --> 08:09.010
and then goes back
to a regular life.

08:09.053 --> 08:12.274
A pickle goes to Vegas,
loses everything

08:12.317 --> 08:14.494
and then moves to Vegas.

08:15.712 --> 08:17.801
I'm pretty sure I'm a cucumber.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.021
You may be,
but you got to remember

08:20.064 --> 08:22.023
that a cucumber can
become a pickle.

08:22.066 --> 08:25.287
But a pickle can never go back
to being a cucumber.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.550
So how do I know which one I am?

08:27.594 --> 08:31.075
You could try a little
controlled gambling,

08:31.119 --> 08:32.468
see how that goes.

08:36.167 --> 08:40.607
A-Are you telling me to gamble?

08:40.650 --> 08:42.434
Is this a trap? I...

08:42.478 --> 08:45.002
If you can gamble a little
and then stop,

08:45.046 --> 08:48.049
well, more than likely,
you don't have a problem.

08:48.092 --> 08:51.052
But you got to be careful,
'cause if it triggers

08:51.095 --> 08:55.099
a-a bigger binge, well,
then you got to call me.

08:55.143 --> 08:58.276
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

09:00.148 --> 09:03.151
I got to tell you,
it's really weird

09:03.194 --> 09:05.675
to take recovery advice from
a guy who's drinking a beer.

09:05.719 --> 09:07.677
Mm.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.984
Hard cider, but I feel you.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.729
How you feeling?

09:15.772 --> 09:19.776
My advice? Don't get cancer.

09:19.820 --> 09:22.170
Making a mental note.

09:22.213 --> 09:24.433
Mm. What kind of car is this?

09:24.476 --> 09:25.739
An '85 Firebird.

09:25.782 --> 09:29.090
Whoo, oh,
that is a sweet ride.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.092
Yeah. It was in 1985.

09:33.268 --> 09:37.011
Now it's 3,000 pounds of scrap
metal and a cassette player.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.361
Well, well, still,
I appreciate you driving me.

09:39.404 --> 09:41.145
It's the least I can do.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.407
Well, I would argue
the least you can do

09:42.451 --> 09:44.279
is remember you said
you would do it.

09:45.846 --> 09:48.022
Again, sorry about that.

09:48.065 --> 09:50.851
Want to make it up to me?

09:50.894 --> 09:52.635
We've been over this.
I'm engaged.

09:52.679 --> 09:56.160
Oh, no, no, no.

09:56.204 --> 09:58.641
I'm thinking
you could let me drive.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.774
You're blind.

10:00.817 --> 10:05.779
I am? Well, at least
I'm still white and rich.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.782
I don't think you
driving is a good idea.

10:08.825 --> 10:11.654
It's a terrible idea.
I know that.

10:11.698 --> 10:15.397
But right now, cancer
is in charge of everything.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.007
I'd like to be
in control of something

10:17.051 --> 10:18.487
for a couple of minutes.

10:18.530 --> 10:21.185
Even if it's only
an old Firebird.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.712
[tires screeching]

10:27.670 --> 10:28.845
BONNIE:
Light pole dead ahead!

10:28.889 --> 10:30.064
MUNSON:
Oh!

10:30.107 --> 10:32.066
BONNIE:
Ah!

10:32.109 --> 10:34.677
Ooh.Oh, what is this, a V-8?

10:34.721 --> 10:37.288
V-6, and please, slow down.[chuckles]

10:46.733 --> 10:49.866
I baked you a cake!

10:49.910 --> 10:51.694
What?

10:51.738 --> 10:54.610
You're gambling?
You had 90 days.

10:54.654 --> 10:58.092
It's okay, this is called
"controlled gambling."

10:58.135 --> 11:00.224
[scoffs]
You can't control anything.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.749
And I've known you
almost your entire life.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.187
I bought ten scratchers.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.537
I'm gonna do three of them
and leave the rest.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.539
Which will prove I can
stop whenever I want.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.019
This is insane.

11:12.062 --> 11:14.108
This is like when I said
I could drink on an airplane

11:14.151 --> 11:17.198
because I'm not technically
on planet Earth.

11:17.241 --> 11:21.202
You're never technically
on planet Earth.

11:21.245 --> 11:24.640
Now back off. Ned from my
GA meeting told me to do this.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.556
Ned?

11:27.599 --> 11:31.125
Okay, which one of
you idiotsis Ned?!

11:33.693 --> 11:35.520
All right, I'm gonna have
a meatball sandwich,

11:35.564 --> 11:36.783
and then we're gonna talk.

11:44.138 --> 11:47.532
She barged into my GA meeting
like a cracked out giraffe

11:47.576 --> 11:49.099
and yelled at the guy
who's helping me.

11:49.143 --> 11:51.711
I didn't yell, I don't yell.
I don't have to yell.

11:51.754 --> 11:52.973
You yell all the time.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.757
Do you want me to yell?
'Cause I'll yell.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.586
You kind of asked for that.

11:59.544 --> 12:02.330
Look, I had my doubts about
whether I need GA,

12:02.373 --> 12:04.636
and Ned suggested
I try controlled gambling.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.550
Ridiculous, right?

12:05.594 --> 12:06.813
Well, actually,
Bonnie...

12:06.856 --> 12:07.814
Work with me!

12:07.857 --> 12:10.294
Yelling.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.776
When a newcomer is
really struggling

12:13.820 --> 12:15.647
with doubts about
being an alcoholic,

12:15.691 --> 12:18.520
I have suggested trying
some controlled drinking.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.609
Why wasn't that offered to me?

12:20.652 --> 12:22.611
Because you came to
your first meeting

12:22.654 --> 12:24.265
on a stolen lawnmower.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.615
You weren't there.

12:26.658 --> 12:29.183
She didn't have to be.
That story's legendary.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.532
I heard all you
were wearing were

12:30.575 --> 12:32.490
go-go boots and
a hockey jersey.

12:32.534 --> 12:33.840
Is that true?

12:33.883 --> 12:35.450
Yeah, Wendy, I got
kicked out of a hockey game.

12:35.493 --> 12:37.321
I couldn't find my car
or my pants.

12:38.496 --> 12:41.151
Over the past week,
I've played lotto twice,

12:41.195 --> 12:42.805
did a little online poker.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.286
Even bet a busboy I could
work an entire shift

12:45.329 --> 12:47.288
without saying
the word "enjoy."

12:47.331 --> 12:48.855
So I went with mangia,

12:48.898 --> 12:50.595
but it made everyone
uncomfortable.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.295
But the point is,
none of it triggered me,

12:54.338 --> 12:56.210
which proves I am not
addicted to gambling.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.428
Yes, you are.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.647
Maybe Christy's right.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.170
I mean, I know someone
who got really drunk

13:00.214 --> 13:02.390
on New Year's Eve, slept
with her Uber driver,

13:02.433 --> 13:04.522
and mistook a neighborhood
raccoon for her cat.

13:06.176 --> 13:08.178
She got herpes and rabies
in one night,

13:08.222 --> 13:09.919
but she's not an alcoholic.

13:11.355 --> 13:12.748
There you go.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.795
I'm the gambling version
of her disease-riddled friend.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.580
And later, if you do
discover you have a problem,

13:18.623 --> 13:19.755
you know where to go.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.539
Well...

13:21.583 --> 13:23.803
everyone at this table
can suck it.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.851
I gambled three times.You keep saying that,

13:28.895 --> 13:31.158
but you've always been
a degenerate gambler.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.420
What are you talking about?

13:32.463 --> 13:33.595
By the time you were
in third grade,

13:33.638 --> 13:35.423
you were hustling drunks
at pool.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.599
That's 'cause someone used
the bar at the bus station

13:37.642 --> 13:38.730
as day care.

13:38.774 --> 13:41.777
It takes a village,
Christy.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.344
And the syrup goes in the fridge

13:43.387 --> 13:45.433
unless you also want
to gamble with botulism.

13:45.476 --> 13:48.262
"Refrigerate after opening."

13:54.137 --> 13:57.010
It's like you want me
to have a gambling problem

13:57.053 --> 13:58.576
just so you can be right;
you're rooting against me.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.969
Rooting against you?

14:00.013 --> 14:01.623
Did I not stand
in this very kitchen

14:01.666 --> 14:04.452
and spend ten hours
making you a cake?

14:05.888 --> 14:08.412
You are on your way
to getting a law degree,

14:08.456 --> 14:10.719
and if you're not careful you
can kiss that dream good-bye.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.852
You know what I think?
I think all you care about

14:12.895 --> 14:14.636
is that I become a lawyer
so you're off the hook.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.725
What hook?In your twisted mind,

14:16.768 --> 14:18.814
if I become a success,
then it won't matter

14:18.858 --> 14:20.337
that you were the world's
worst mother.

14:20.381 --> 14:22.252
Well, guess what.

14:22.296 --> 14:23.732
You'll never be off the hook

14:23.775 --> 14:25.516
no matter how many
terrible cakes you make.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.867
You said it was delicious.I lied!

14:29.129 --> 14:30.739
It tasted like salad dressing.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.219
How does that happen?

14:32.262 --> 14:33.916
We were out of milk.

14:36.919 --> 14:39.008
Whoa.What?

14:39.052 --> 14:41.881
It's a check for $5,432.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.753
Is it made out to me?
Did I sell my book?

14:44.796 --> 14:47.712
No, it's an excess check.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.802
What the hell's an excess check,
and how do I get one?

14:50.846 --> 14:52.674
It's left over
from my student loan.

14:52.717 --> 14:54.937
It's for school supplies
and living expenses.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.025
Well, then give it to me.No.

14:56.069 --> 14:57.374
You can't be trusted.No.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.420
Oh, my God,
would you stop? Ugh!

14:59.463 --> 15:02.684
And FYI, no one is buying
your young adult novel.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.773
You're a decade late
for teenage vampires.

15:04.816 --> 15:08.603
And FYI to you,
I changed it to teenage robots.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.866
And one of them's transgender.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.611
I mean, is Christy right?

15:16.654 --> 15:18.961
Am I really so selfish
that the only reason

15:19.005 --> 15:20.832
I want my daughter
to be a success

15:20.876 --> 15:24.184
is so that I'll feel better
about being a bad mom?

15:29.015 --> 15:31.234
I guess it's possible.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.844
I mean, I know
I can be selfish.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.672
And if I forget, I've got
people reminding me

15:34.716 --> 15:37.893
every ten minutes.

15:37.937 --> 15:43.507
But I think maybe... this
time it's about love.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.292
Is that so hard
to believe?

15:49.731 --> 15:52.995
Something one could say
in this moment...

15:53.039 --> 15:54.649
is that I have indeed
changed a little

15:54.692 --> 15:56.216
in the last
couple of years.

15:56.259 --> 16:00.133
I do things for other people
that don't just benefit me.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.874
Like this ride to the doctor.
Nothing in it for me.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.137
Nothing.

16:04.180 --> 16:07.444
Not even conversation.

16:12.188 --> 16:14.582
Are you pouting because
I won't let you drive again?

16:14.625 --> 16:16.149
Yep.
[scoffs]

16:19.152 --> 16:22.982
Hi, Ned, it's
Christy from GA,

16:23.025 --> 16:26.811
and, uh, I'm in
the parking lot

16:26.855 --> 16:29.858
of that casino
off Highway 12.

16:29.901 --> 16:34.602
And I've got $5,000 in my hand.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.434
So, anyway...
[chuckles]

16:40.477 --> 16:43.045
hope you're having
a good afternoon.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.874
And if you have a chance,
call me back.

16:45.917 --> 16:48.485
Okay, thanks. Bye.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.274
Oh, screw it.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.766
Mom, I need your help.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.335
CHRISTY:
Don't think about gambling.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.423
Don't think about gambling.

17:13.467 --> 17:14.816
Don't think about blackjack.

17:14.859 --> 17:16.122
Don't think about
the Wheel of Fortune slots

17:16.165 --> 17:17.819
with the progressive jackpot
that's probably

17:17.862 --> 17:20.082
six figures right now.

17:20.126 --> 17:21.736
What if I just
have a shrimp cocktail

17:21.779 --> 17:22.954
and watch other people gamble?

17:22.998 --> 17:24.739
That'd be fine, right?

17:24.782 --> 17:26.567
I think it would be fine.
Let's go!

17:26.610 --> 17:28.786
I'm here.
I'm here.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.875
Oh, thank God.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.791
Oh, I'm so proud of you
for calling me.

17:33.835 --> 17:34.879
You still
got the money, right?

17:34.923 --> 17:36.272
Show me the money.
Where is it?

17:36.316 --> 17:38.492
I put it in the trunk.
It was talking to me.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.102
Okay, don't take this
to mean I don't trust you,

17:40.146 --> 17:41.582
but I'm gonna go check
if you're lying.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.454
Mom, wait.
You were right.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.804
Go on.

17:48.154 --> 17:50.330
I do have a gambling problem.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.245
But only when I have money.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.464
And since I so rarely
have money,

17:54.508 --> 17:55.813
it doesn't come up
that often.

17:55.857 --> 17:59.556
Man, if we'd been rich,
we'd both be dead.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.429
And what I said earlier
was unfair.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.344
You really were
just looking out for me.

18:04.387 --> 18:07.825
I realize that hasn't
always been the case,

18:07.869 --> 18:10.045
so I get why
you'd have your doubts.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.266
Wow.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.702
You've really changed.

18:17.879 --> 18:19.010
And I haven't at all.

18:19.054 --> 18:21.187
Aw...

18:21.230 --> 18:22.927
[banging on window][both gasp]

18:22.971 --> 18:24.494
I got here as fast
as I could.

18:24.538 --> 18:27.497
Did she gamble?She did not.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.064
Good. Where's the money?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.719
In the trunk.
Allegedly.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.025
[banging on window][all gasp]

18:34.069 --> 18:36.637
I came as soon as I got
the message. Did you gamble?

18:36.680 --> 18:37.681
She did not.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.074
Good. Someone has
the money, right?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.642
There are unconfirmed reports
that it's in the trunk.

18:41.685 --> 18:42.904
Go look if you
don't believe me.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.253
Of course I believe you.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.646
[banging on window][all gasp]

18:45.689 --> 18:46.821
Did we get here in time?

18:46.864 --> 18:49.128
Yes.
Geez, Mom, did you
call everyone?

18:49.171 --> 18:50.738
Yeah.
I was really worried.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.870
Scooch over, I'm coming in.Okay.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.394
There's no room for me.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.047
Wendy, since you're out there,
go look in the trunk and see

18:56.091 --> 18:57.092
if you can find $5,000.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.485
What?
Just do it!

18:58.528 --> 18:59.921
You don't have to yell.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.445
Thank you.

19:05.231 --> 19:08.625
It means so much to me
that you guys are all here.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.975
I'm sorry I'm
such a screwup.
Oh...

19:11.019 --> 19:12.194
We're all screwups.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.761
That's why
we love each other.

19:13.804 --> 19:14.762
WENDY:
No money back here.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.024
Christy!WENDY: Wait, found it.

19:16.067 --> 19:18.418
I never doubted you.

19:18.461 --> 19:20.028
Give it a quick count.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.638
[phone chiming]

19:21.682 --> 19:23.249
Hang on, guys,
I got to take this.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.295
Hi, Ned.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.649
Turns out I'm a pickle.

19:32.693 --> 19:35.217
Uh, Bonnie, I think
someone's stealing your car.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.785
Damn it, Mr. Munson!

19:46.794 --> 19:48.317
Hey.
Hey.

19:48.361 --> 19:51.407
Did you try
the bison tacos?

19:51.451 --> 19:56.238
No, I filled up on the
buffet at the casino.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.414
You gambled again?

19:58.458 --> 20:00.242
Yeah.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.332
Another first day.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.029
Pathetic, right?

20:05.073 --> 20:08.207
Not at all.
I-I get it.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.034
Thank God we have
a place to go.

20:10.078 --> 20:13.124
I know. And so
convenient.

20:13.168 --> 20:18.652
Right off the freeway, ample
parking, five dollar tables.

20:18.695 --> 20:21.002
I meant GA.
Oh, right.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.787
Focus, Lucy!

20:23.831 --> 20:26.573
Hey, you want to be
my sponsor?

20:26.616 --> 20:29.489
I've only got
one day myself.

20:29.532 --> 20:31.099
But, uh...

20:31.142 --> 20:34.668
But let me tell you something
that really helped me.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.974
There are two kinds
of gamblers:

20:37.018 --> 20:39.281
cucumbers and pickles.
