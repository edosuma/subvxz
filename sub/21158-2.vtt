[Alba] <i>There are moments</i>
<i>when time seems to stand still.</i>

00:09.040 --> 00:11.640
<i>Instants when you remember,</i>
<i>in barely a second,</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:14.080
<i>all the important moments of your life.</i>

00:14.160 --> 00:15.840
<i>To forget or to remember...</i>

00:15.920 --> 00:20.240
<i>I thought I could forget my past</i>
<i>if I took the money.</i>

00:20.320 --> 00:22.440
<i>How could I be so naive?</i>

00:23.080 --> 00:24.840
<i>You can't forget who you are</i>

00:24.920 --> 00:27.960
<i>because someone always comes along</i>
<i>to make you remember.</i>

00:28.040 --> 00:31.200
If it's you, why lie to me, Alba?

00:33.320 --> 00:34.800
Now you understand.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.480
I didn't know you were here.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.160
It's the truth.

00:45.360 --> 00:48.440
I imagined a thousand times
how I'd see you again.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.840
Crossing the street
with a husband and two children.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.920
Or in the paper as the first woman
to achieve God knows what.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.160
I imagined it all...

00:59.040 --> 01:00.800
except this.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.000
-Let me go, Francisco.
-Leave the money and shut the safe.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.720
I can't do that.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.160
I need this money. You don't understand.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.240
Why? Tell me.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.840
Why do you want to rob me?

01:13.560 --> 01:17.240
If I don't have this money before 1:00,
I'm in big trouble.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.680
[door opens]

01:24.080 --> 01:25.480
[Carlos] Francisco?

01:28.680 --> 01:31.120
Everyone is toasting downstairs,
and you're up here.

01:33.040 --> 01:36.080
Some cocktail party bills
had to be paid in advance.

01:36.160 --> 01:39.040
-I came for the money.
-Where were they?

01:39.120 --> 01:41.200
I knew I'd left them here. I was sure.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.920
You should be more careful.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.520
The wrong person could get
their hands on them.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.520
You were right.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.760
It was a bad idea to trust
the new girl with the call.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.240
[chuckles] I was sure she could do it.

01:52.160 --> 01:54.160
[Francisco] Never mind. It all worked out.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.760
That girl Lidia has me under her spell.

02:08.840 --> 02:11.520
My father was grinning from ear to ear.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.920
"We've made history, my son!"
he kept saying.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.600
I need at least two drinks

02:15.680 --> 02:18.520
before he starts bragging
in front of the king.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.600
Francisco!

02:20.520 --> 02:23.440
I'm getting security to change the locks
to my office and the safe.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.960
But the keys turned up.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.120
I know, but we have
a lot of new staff this week,

02:27.200 --> 02:28.680
and you never know who you can trust.

02:28.760 --> 02:30.520
[sighs]

02:30.600 --> 02:33.520
[clicks tongue] Don't leave me alone
for long...

02:34.760 --> 02:36.600
with those old fogies.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.760
[sighs]

02:44.880 --> 02:47.720
-[Carlota] Leaving already?
-I don't belong here. I quit.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.680
-[Ángeles] Lidia.
-Will you hand it in for me? I have to go.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.240
If it's about the call,
I can talk to Sara.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.160
-[Alba] I don't want you to.
-But she can help.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.240
I don't want you to help me.
Not you, not Ángeles, none of you!

03:01.000 --> 03:02.720
Why? We're friends.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.800
-I don't have any friends.
-But I thought we--

03:04.880 --> 03:06.520
Well, no!

03:06.600 --> 03:08.800
Someone you've known for two days
is not your friend!

03:08.880 --> 03:11.360
You don't help her or trust her,
because you don't know her!

03:11.440 --> 03:12.880
You don't know who I am.

04:49.600 --> 04:51.320

that you're ready for this promotion.

CHAPTER 2: MEMORIES

05:02.440 --> 05:06.000
I need you to supervise the girls,
so please think it over before you decide.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.120
-Sara.
-Don Francisco.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.040
I'm looking for Miss Aguilar.
I want to speak to her.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.560
She left.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.440
She gathered her things and left
a few minutes ago.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.800
She asked me to hand in
her resignation for her.

05:19.880 --> 05:20.720
Thank you.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.760
-Come here, blue eyes.
-[chuckles]

05:28.680 --> 05:29.920
[Carolina moaning]

05:32.680 --> 05:35.400
-Mario, we shouldn't be doing this.
-What's wrong?

05:35.480 --> 05:39.600
I'm just a man celebrating
finally getting a decent job

05:39.680 --> 05:41.680
with a woman in his arms
who drives him crazy.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.160
[Carolina] You mean "lover."

05:44.080 --> 05:46.360
[Mario] I told you, I'm leaving her.
It's a matter of time.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.760
[Carolina moans]

05:47.840 --> 05:50.240
We agreed not to do this
in the office until your wife quits.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.920
[Mario] What does it matter?

05:53.400 --> 05:55.880
[Carolina] How can you be so sure
she's going to quit?

05:55.960 --> 05:57.360
Because I'm her husband...

05:58.760 --> 06:01.360
and I ordered her to do it.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.680
Well, Sara's offered her a promotion...

06:08.480 --> 06:09.880
and from what I heard,

06:09.960 --> 06:13.240
the conditions are much better
than what she's had up to now.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.120
[Mario] She didn't say anything to me.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.720
Nothing can justify
the way Lidia treated you.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.120
We all have our problems.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.760
You miss your hometown,
I've been kicked out of my house...

06:29.120 --> 06:30.120
Marga!

06:31.080 --> 06:33.040
It's the guy who got my purse back.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.240
-[Carlota] Him?
-He works here?

06:35.320 --> 06:38.520
He's in administration.
Pablo, I think he's called.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.920
I don't believe it.
Pablo from administration?

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
He's one of my subscribers.
I connect all his calls.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.160
Look at him.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.080
Handsome, isn't he? I mean, he's cute.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.520
With the fright yesterday,
I didn't notice.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.440
He's a dish, huh?

06:54.800 --> 06:56.120
A dish...

06:56.200 --> 06:59.680
He's too far away for me
to tell you if he's a dish.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.480
-Introduce yourself, then you can tell me.
-No, no... Are you crazy?

07:03.560 --> 07:05.120
After the fool I made of myself, no.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.320
I ran off, Carlota,
as if he was the thief.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.840
-Go on, Marga, go.
-No.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.320
-Look out.
-Sorry.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.400
Sorry, miss, I didn't see you.

07:17.080 --> 07:19.120
[both panting]

07:20.960 --> 07:23.120
Sometimes I'm a real klutz.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.360
[chuckles]

07:24.440 --> 07:27.160
A strange way to finally meet Mario.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.200
-Uh, Mario?
-Mm-hmm.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.720
My husband.

07:30.800 --> 07:34.800
I hadn't had the chance to introduce you,
but this is Carlota and Marga.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.080
Nice to meet you.

07:36.160 --> 07:38.120
-Shall we go?
-Sure.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.640
-Bye.
-Bye.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.400
-Shall we go, honey?
-Mm-hmm.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.640
Oh! I've got to pick up Sofía
from Doña María's house.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.160
You don't need to. I spoke to her.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.480
Sofía's spending the night there.

07:55.560 --> 07:56.560
Why?

07:56.640 --> 07:59.040
Because you've got to dine
and dance with your husband.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.280
I want you to start enjoying
the kind of life

08:01.360 --> 08:03.480
that I'll give you
when you stop working.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.400
-[Carlota] Go on, tell me.
-[Marga] Tell you what?

08:06.480 --> 08:08.440
[Carlota] Your head's somewhere else.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.440
[Marga] No, Carlota, I'm fine. I'm--

08:10.520 --> 08:12.520
-[Carlota] You're an open book.
-[Marga] Carlota...

08:12.600 --> 08:14.680
[Carlota] You've been
like this since work.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.160
-[Marga] No, I'm fine.
-Tell me.

08:16.240 --> 08:19.920
I can be a pest when I want
to know something, so just tell me!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.400
It's fine, really. Let's drop it.

08:22.480 --> 08:23.600
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.440
Carlota, you have a visitor.

08:37.679 --> 08:38.640
Why are you here?

08:57.480 --> 08:59.360
-Kicking her out didn't work.
-[clicks tongue]

08:59.440 --> 09:02.840
She hasn't thought it over,
and she's standing her ground.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.400
It hasn't been long.
Perhaps in a few days we can--

09:06.480 --> 09:08.480
And what will people think?

09:08.560 --> 09:11.120
That I can't straighten out
my own daughter?

09:12.240 --> 09:14.720
We tried it your way. Now it's my turn.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.960
Emilio, please don't do anything
we might regret later.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.720
I know what I have to do.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.720
[sighs]

09:25.800 --> 09:28.280
-[music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

09:28.360 --> 09:30.360
[Ricardo] Your Majesty, we cannot rest

09:30.440 --> 09:33.640
if we want our companies
to keep progressing as they have been.

09:33.720 --> 09:37.400
It's an ambitious plan,
considering the world's not infinite.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.560
You know the saying. "Good business
means staying one jump ahead."

09:40.640 --> 09:42.600
It just means seeing into the future.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.160
And here we have our expert.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.800
Francisco, finally.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.040
Your Majesty, I'm so sorry I'm late.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.240
Three years ago, I thought he was crazy

09:52.320 --> 09:56.560
when he proposed building a skyscraper
in the capital and look now.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.080
[Francisco] It was Carlos' idea.

09:58.160 --> 10:01.120
[Ricardo] But it wouldn't have become
a reality without your work.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.320
He hired the architect
and supervised construction personally.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.720
Three years of colossal work.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.000
Uh, Majesty...

10:14.680 --> 10:18.320
Let him puff his feathers like a peacock.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.680
You don't need his praise.
You have his shares.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.080
[Carlos chuckles]

10:28.680 --> 10:30.240
Are you all right?

10:30.320 --> 10:31.560
I'm fine, really.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.160
Don't let what he said get to you.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.800
Thanks.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.440
There's a list of subscribers
I want you to listen to.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.200
Francisco, I need help.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.280
With the opening of the building,
I have barely any time.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.160
Get an operator
to carry out the assignment.

13:35.960 --> 13:36.880
Okay.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.240
Sara!

13:42.280 --> 13:44.080
Someone you can control.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.360
Don Benjamín, I'm glad you could make it.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.840
Who could decline an invitation like this?

13:54.920 --> 13:57.520
It's one of those events
you tell your grandchildren about.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.000
That's exactly why we had to invite
our government delegate.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
[inhales sharply]

14:02.160 --> 14:05.920
But I wasn't sure if you could come.
You're so busy.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.360
-Yes, the past weeks have been difficult.
-I imagine.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.200
No one said
leading a double life was easy.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.320
Excuse me?

14:14.400 --> 14:15.720
Don't act surprised.

14:15.800 --> 14:19.200
You can fool your wife,
but don't play innocent with me.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.880
I'm not having a good day.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.200
The transcriptions of your chats
with your wife's sister,

14:24.280 --> 14:26.680
everything from the last few weeks.

14:34.960 --> 14:36.000
What do you want?

14:36.080 --> 14:38.960
Government authorization...
that is, your authorization...

14:39.040 --> 14:41.320
to raise subscriber fees.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.360
Come now, you can convince anyone.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.640
I think I can help you.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.760
Don Ricardo will be happy to hear that.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.840
But the company must also do me
and the regime a favor.

14:55.360 --> 14:59.240
We know a faction of the army is unhappy
with government orders.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.120
The king fears a coup.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.040
He wants the rebels' names
and the date of the coup.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.000
You can count on having our collaboration
and service.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.840
[boxes clattering]

15:19.200 --> 15:21.400
Nothing, no trace of the money.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.400
[man] Beltrán said it should be here.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.760
Keep looking.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.960

16:26.520 --> 16:28.920
Here, put this on.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.920
Go on.
Do you want to catch pneumonia?

16:34.000 --> 16:35.080
Go on.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.960
[sighs] Why'd they lock you up?

16:43.080 --> 16:46.400
It was a mistake. I'm not a thief.

16:47.680 --> 16:52.440
In this city, just looking like one
can get you in here.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.480
You don't look like a thief,
and you're in this cell, too.

16:56.560 --> 17:00.280
[chuckles] Yes, but there's a difference.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.480
You know how long it'll take me
to get out?

17:02.560 --> 17:05.119
One hour. Two, tops.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.520
But, you...
How long have you been in here?

17:11.680 --> 17:13.680
When my boyfriend finds me,
he'll get me--

17:13.760 --> 17:15.160
Yeah, sure.

17:16.160 --> 17:20.359
Here's some advice.
Never wait for a man to help you out.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.520
I'm sure he's replaced you by now.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.400
Come on. Your bail's been posted.

I wanted to apologize.
I acted like an idiot this morning.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.440
I felt bad and took it out on you.
It wasn't your fault.

18:24.800 --> 18:25.840
I'm sorry.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.160
It's okay.

18:30.240 --> 18:33.400
It's no wonder you were nervous.
About the call, I mean.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.040
So don't worry.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.320
Thanks.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.920
Well, I won't bother you.
I can see you're busy.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.760
Welcome to the boardinghouse, Lidia.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.200
Luckily, Lola's at church.

18:59.280 --> 19:02.560
She left 50 minutes ago.
It's a ten-minute walk...

19:02.640 --> 19:05.160
Carlota said
there was plenty of time for...

19:05.240 --> 19:07.560
What was it called? A soirée.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.160
It turns out it means "party" in French.

19:11.240 --> 19:15.080
I'm sorry. You've got yourself
a republican suffragette girlfriend.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.240
[Carlota] "Girlfriend"?

19:16.320 --> 19:19.360
No, I'm free.
And if you're against women voting--

19:19.440 --> 19:24.520
[Víctor] If women vote, it'll hurt us,
because most are housewives or religious,

19:24.600 --> 19:27.120
so they'd vote for whoever
their husbands or the church says.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.080
[Carlota] The issue
is that they're dependent...

19:29.160 --> 19:32.800

-Yes.

And a last-minute guest.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.320
What are you doing here?

19:41.400 --> 19:44.080
You left it pretty clear
how you felt about us this morning.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.840
Carlota, she apologized.

19:45.920 --> 19:50.880
Yes... I took it out on you
when it wasn't your fault, so I'm sorry.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.240
Well, all right. Get yourself a drink.
What did you bring?

19:58.440 --> 20:00.760
Anisette. You really brought anisette?

20:00.840 --> 20:03.280
-It's what they do in my town.
-[scoffs]

20:03.360 --> 20:05.760
-Have you ever drunk anisette?
-Never.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.120
But they say it helps you forget.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.160
Are you all right?

20:15.400 --> 20:20.400
I opened the door,
and there was Ángeles' husband...

20:21.120 --> 20:23.440
and Francisco's secretary, Carolina...

20:26.000 --> 20:27.320

20:28.640 --> 20:30.400

20:31.400 --> 20:34.160
Now I'm not sure. Do I tell her or not?

20:34.240 --> 20:37.760
If it were me, I'd like to know.

20:37.840 --> 20:41.480
But Ángeles is a mother.
She's married with a child.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.920
-What would you do?
-You and I are very different.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.480
But if you'd seen them
and had to see Ángeles the next day...

20:50.960 --> 20:52.280
would you tell her?

20:55.640 --> 20:57.600
I've never liked people meddling
in my life,

20:57.680 --> 21:02.200
so I'd rather not meddle in theirs.
You save yourself a lot of trouble.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.480
And you can keep yourself

That's why I couldn't resign.

<i>you can even get people to risk</i>
<i>what they treasure most.</i>

28:32.120 --> 28:33.320
[Carlota] Ángeles!

28:34.400 --> 28:35.480
Ángeles!

28:38.520 --> 28:39.520
Hello.

28:40.040 --> 28:43.280
Lidia, I thought you weren't coming back
to the company.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.360
I'm not, but I need a favor.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.560
But you have to know,
you may be risking your job.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.640
[Carlota] All our jobs, but it's
for a good cause. Some guys want to--

28:50.720 --> 28:52.600
-[overlapping chatter]
-I can explain.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.680
No, there's nothing to explain.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.920
[sighs] What do I have to do?

29:05.040 --> 29:08.440
Are you sure you can make
a call seem like it's coming from France?

29:08.520 --> 29:10.720
I've been working here for years.

29:10.800 --> 29:13.120
Marga, keep a lookout for Sara.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.640
Yes, I'll be the lookout.

29:15.760 --> 29:17.360
Go, get inside. I'll do it.

29:18.760 --> 29:19.960
[sighs]

29:32.440 --> 29:33.680
[Emilio] Mr. Pascual!

29:34.400 --> 29:35.400
Get in.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.960
[whispering] Do you know
the subscriber number?

29:48.760 --> 29:50.480
San Blas 415.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.720
[in French] 415 San Blas.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.720
Carlota, I need to talk to you.
Can you come with me?

30:02.800 --> 30:04.400
Not now. I'll see you later.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.480
Hey!

30:09.680 --> 30:12.120
-Where'd you get all this money?
-Your father.

30:12.200 --> 30:13.440
He tried to bribe me into leaving you.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.680
He thinks I convinced you
to become independent.

30:18.880 --> 30:20.000
I'm sorry.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.880
[phone ringing]

30:24.680 --> 30:25.560
Hello.

30:25.640 --> 30:29.360
[in French accent]
Monsieur, you have a call from Paris.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.040
Do you wish to take it?

30:31.880 --> 30:33.480
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

30:36.520 --> 30:38.400
[Alba] <i>Bonjour, Beltrán.</i>

30:38.480 --> 30:40.160
You bitch.

30:40.240 --> 30:46.280
You can tell your thugs to leave me alone
or to get their passports...

30:47.080 --> 30:49.120
and cross the Pyrenees.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.160
<i>I swear I won't stop until I find you.</i>

30:54.960 --> 30:56.800
What are you up to?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.360
[Sara] <i>Speak up. What are you doing?</i>

30:59.440 --> 31:00.920
France, huh?

31:01.920 --> 31:04.320
I don't know how you did it,
but I will track you down

31:04.400 --> 31:05.920
<i>and get my money. Do you hear me?</i>

31:06.000 --> 31:09.760
<i>My money, or I'll report you</i>
<i>and make sure you're executed--</i>

31:12.080 --> 31:13.800
I want an explanation.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.040
[stammers]

31:16.320 --> 31:17.800
You, too?

31:17.880 --> 31:21.040
You all know how serious it is
to let non-staff

31:21.120 --> 31:23.400
make use of these switchboards.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.560
You'll have to explain to the director,

31:26.080 --> 31:28.680
and he'll decide if you follow
Miss Aguilar's footsteps

31:28.760 --> 31:29.960
and lose your jobs.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.360
-No, they--
-That's enough!

31:32.160 --> 31:33.920
All of you, come with me.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.680
Let's go.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.240
Don Francisco,
I'm sorry to have called you at home.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.240
It seems it wasn't enough for Miss Aguilar
to ruin the king's call.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.840
She thinks the switchboard room
is her parlor

31:51.920 --> 31:53.080
and went inside with her friends.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.880
[Alba] It's all my fault.
They're not to blame.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.080
You can explain it to me in my office.

31:58.160 --> 31:59.880
The rest of you wait outside.

32:04.360 --> 32:07.480
The girls weren't involved.
It's not fair their jobs are at stake.

32:07.560 --> 32:09.440
I thought I'd never see you again.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.920
It's only because I had no choice.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.640
What did you do?

32:19.880 --> 32:22.080
I needed the switchboard and the girls.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.320
For what?

32:23.400 --> 32:26.160
To make someone think
I was out of the country.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.280
-Who is this person?
-What does that matter?

32:28.360 --> 32:30.280
I want to know if you're in danger, Alba.

32:32.560 --> 32:33.960
I owe money...

32:35.960 --> 32:38.440
and if I don't pay it back,
I'll go to jail or worse.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.960
That's why I opened the safe.

32:42.120 --> 32:43.240
[scoffs]

32:44.840 --> 32:47.000
I'm not the girl you knew.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.800
This is what I've become.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.320
When you pay these people...

32:55.880 --> 33:00.120
could you start a new life? Maybe here?

33:00.680 --> 33:04.000
I haven't relied on anyone for ten years,
and this won't be the exception.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.280
I didn't say I'd give you the money.
It'd be a loan.

33:07.360 --> 33:10.960
You could pay it off
and come back to work tomorrow.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.800
I'm sorry.

33:13.720 --> 33:17.240
I'll find a way out of this,
like I always have.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.480
Alba, if you don't stay,
the girls will lose their jobs.

33:19.560 --> 33:21.000
They'll be the ones who pay.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.880
[inhales deeply]

33:25.960 --> 33:27.160
Alba...

33:28.800 --> 33:31.440
I'm not the boy
you knew back home, either.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.040
Do you want to try me?

33:45.840 --> 33:47.000
[softly] You wouldn't dare.

33:47.080 --> 33:48.400
[chuckles]

33:50.560 --> 33:53.360
I might do anything
to keep you close to me.

33:57.640 --> 34:00.400
Miss Aguilar filled me in,
and it's all clear now.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.080
Don't let it happen again. All right?

34:02.720 --> 34:04.960
Back to your posts.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.200
-And Sara...
-Yes, Don Francisco.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.280
Miss Aguilar is coming back
to the company.

34:09.360 --> 34:11.280
But she'll be in customer support.

34:11.880 --> 34:14.440
It's punishment enough for a new girl.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.480
Miss Aguilar!

34:20.120 --> 34:22.760
Sara, I want to speak to you alone.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.400
[Carolina] First Carlos, now Francisco.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.120
Heads have rolled for less here,
but you're still standing.

34:32.199 --> 34:34.800
I don't know what you do
in that office to get away with it,

34:34.880 --> 34:36.800
but I can imagine.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.280
Be very careful.

34:38.360 --> 34:41.000
I think you're running out of bosses
to string along.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.199
You be careful.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.560
From now on,
stay out of my business.

34:44.639 --> 34:47.360
You don't want to have me as an enemy.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.719
I sure wouldn't.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.560
A coup d'état!

34:57.360 --> 34:59.480
It's what the government delegate fears.

35:00.040 --> 35:03.560
Here's a list of the numbers
of the barracks under suspicion.

35:03.640 --> 35:06.200
As you know,
any detail that might help us.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.240
Who's behind it,
when they're planning to do it...

35:09.640 --> 35:10.960
All right.

35:11.040 --> 35:14.920
And, Sara, absolute discretion, as usual.

35:22.680 --> 35:25.920
Miss Aguilar,
you have a package from management.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.120
Thank you.

35:50.120 --> 35:53.520
I'm dying to know what Lidia said
to Francisco to get us off the hook.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.720
I've got such a headache
and my stomach hurts...

35:55.800 --> 35:59.200
-And you had a great time!
-If I could only remember.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.480
I don't believe it.

36:01.560 --> 36:04.400
I just remembered.
I wrote a letter to Pablo.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.920
What Pablo? Your Pablo?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.640
He's not my Pablo. Well, yes he is.
I gave it to someone...

36:08.720 --> 36:10.560
-What does it say?
-I don't remember.

36:10.640 --> 36:11.720
Marga! Marga!

36:19.800 --> 36:21.560
The note, where is it?

36:21.640 --> 36:23.760
I put it in the mailbox first thing.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.800
They're delivering the mail now.
Ask for Diego.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.840
Ricardo, switch it on!

36:56.080 --> 36:58.520
Diego, anything for me?

37:02.200 --> 37:03.240
Thank you.

37:15.280 --> 37:16.960
What happened? Did he read the note?

37:17.040 --> 37:18.040
Yes.

37:19.360 --> 37:21.360
But at least I don't think he saw me.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.960
It's Pablo. Carlota, it's Pablo.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.000
Then pick it up and sort it out.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.000
No. No, Carlota. No.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.880
No, please. Carlota, no.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.400
Operator 47. How can I help you?

37:51.480 --> 37:53.560
Yes, hello. [clears throat] Forty-seven?

37:54.280 --> 37:55.880
Is this Marga?

37:57.040 --> 37:59.560
No, I'm not Marga.

38:00.560 --> 38:03.280
But you just said you were Operator 47.

38:03.360 --> 38:07.400
I did? I got mixed up.
I'm Operator 57. Five-seven.

38:07.480 --> 38:10.920
<i>I'm Pablo, in administration.</i>
<i>I'd like to speak to Operator 47.</i>

38:11.000 --> 38:13.440
I'm sorry, operators and subscribers
aren't allowed--

38:13.520 --> 38:15.960
I know, but it's important.

38:16.760 --> 38:18.440
Don't worry, it's fine.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.440
I'll come down and speak to her in person.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.640
No. No, there's no need.

38:23.200 --> 38:26.080
Uh, what did you want
to talk to her about?

38:28.200 --> 38:31.720
With all due respect,
this doesn't concern you.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.880
Uh, no, of course not.

38:33.960 --> 38:35.960
Operator 47 isn't here.

38:38.320 --> 38:41.160
Okay. And when can I speak to her?

38:42.160 --> 38:43.400
Never.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.560
I mean, she doesn't work here anymore.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.840
She went home
because she couldn't handle city life.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.160
Well... [clears throat] All right, then.

38:55.240 --> 38:56.440
Thanks a lot.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.160
<i>Sorry to bother you. And you are...</i>

38:59.240 --> 39:03.480
I'm Operator 57... 47... 57.
Don't forget it.

39:04.920 --> 39:08.040
A pleasure, Miss 57.

39:08.120 --> 39:09.720
Same here, Don Pablo.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.160
Have a good day.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.200
Operator 57?

39:24.000 --> 39:25.200
You lied to him.

39:25.280 --> 39:26.320
[sighs]

39:26.840 --> 39:29.240
[chuckles]
You're getting yourself in such a jam!

39:32.880 --> 39:37.920
Customer support, technical
and subscriber assistance. Good afternoon.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.320
[Carlos] <i>Aguilar! I had no idea</i>
<i>you were in customer support.</i>

39:41.800 --> 39:44.080
If my boss hadn't had the bright idea

39:44.160 --> 39:46.480
<i>to have a new hire</i>
<i>handle the king's call...</i>

39:46.560 --> 39:49.800
You're right,
that boss should first apologize

39:49.880 --> 39:52.040
and then take you to dinner tonight.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.600
You're calling the number
for customer support,

39:55.680 --> 39:58.120
not the one for flirting with the staff.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.720
<i>Exactly. Why else would I be calling?</i>

39:59.800 --> 40:03.200
I have a problem... with my line.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.840
-This is your line.
<i>-My </i> other <i> line.</i>

40:06.920 --> 40:10.520
<i>Take a note, miss.</i>
<i>Urgent. No,</i> very <i>urgent.</i>

40:10.600 --> 40:13.560
Right.
When did you start having difficulties?

40:13.640 --> 40:15.880
Some 30 seconds ago.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.800
<i>Could you describe it, please?</i>

40:17.880 --> 40:21.560
I have a reservation for two
in Madrid's most exclusive restaurant,

40:21.640 --> 40:23.960
<i>and my date just turned me down,</i>

40:24.040 --> 40:28.800
so technically, I need your assistance
at once, Miss Aguilar.

40:30.320 --> 40:34.040
I'm sorry, this department
doesn't deal with those claims.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.600
You'll have to call another one.

40:37.280 --> 40:40.880
Lots of girls in the switchboard room
would be willing to help you.

40:40.960 --> 40:44.320
I've called
the switchboard room many times,

40:44.400 --> 40:46.960
but, between you and me,
I wasn't satisfied.

40:47.880 --> 40:52.760
Has it occurred to you that they
might not have been satisfied with you?

40:53.800 --> 40:54.880
Maybe.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.840
There's only one way to find out.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.160
Come to dinner with me.

41:03.600 --> 41:05.760
Have a good evening, Don Carlos.

41:08.160 --> 41:11.480
Good. At 8:30, I'll send a car around.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.520
See you at dinner.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.720
Is this Laura García?

41:19.880 --> 41:22.320
I'm calling on behalf
of the Telephone Company.

41:23.040 --> 41:26.200
We're looking for a replacement
for an operator.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.640
Could you come
for an interview tomorrow?

41:30.280 --> 41:31.160
Thank you.

41:33.600 --> 41:35.000
[crying]

41:35.080 --> 41:37.160
Ángeles, are you all right?

41:39.840 --> 41:42.360
-Who are you replacing?
-Me.

41:45.600 --> 41:48.000
I'm leaving the company, girls.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.240
But why?

41:49.320 --> 41:50.640
Because...

41:51.960 --> 41:57.520
Mario and I decided long ago
that this would be temporary and...

41:57.600 --> 41:59.080
[sobbing]

42:00.520 --> 42:07.200
Mario thinks it's what's best
for the family, and so do I.

42:11.240 --> 42:13.960
But I really like my job.

42:14.040 --> 42:17.520
Then don't quit. You don't have to do
everything Mario says.

42:19.280 --> 42:21.840
Carlota, you don't understand.

42:22.960 --> 42:25.960
My family is very important.

42:26.960 --> 42:28.920
My family comes first.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.280
Mario's cheating on you
with a woman who works here.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.280
That's why he wants you to quit.

42:35.160 --> 42:36.440
[gasping]

42:40.160 --> 42:42.680
Ángeles! Ángeles, wait!

42:42.760 --> 42:44.120
Wait!

42:44.200 --> 42:45.520
Ángeles, wait!

42:46.480 --> 42:48.920
You don't know me. You don't know Mario.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.400
Mario's lying to you.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.360
-You have to know.
-It's not true.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.280
-He's lying to you.
-That's not true.

42:54.360 --> 42:58.800
I've tried to help you,
and now you want to destroy my marriage.

42:58.880 --> 43:01.280
It's no wonder you don't have
any friends, Lidia.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.560
-[Marga] Why did you tell her?
-[Alba] She has to open her eyes!

43:10.640 --> 43:12.800
She can't change her life
for the wrong reasons!

43:16.800 --> 43:18.520
Because so many women...

43:20.320 --> 43:24.320
submit to their husbands,
and she can't be one of them.

43:25.360 --> 43:28.800
You said you didn't like meddling
in other people's lives.

43:31.840 --> 43:33.440
[softly] That's what I thought.

43:35.840 --> 43:38.080
[Alba] <i>I had learned to take care</i>
<i>of myself,</i>

43:38.160 --> 43:42.240
<i>to avoid making friends, to not have</i>
<i>memories that would make me vulnerable,</i>

43:42.800 --> 43:44.800

I'm glad. Now get in the car.

44:51.520 --> 44:52.800
I don't want to.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.640
Please, get in.
I want to show you something.

Maybe you can pay a girl to play

45:11.040 --> 45:12.640

it is to fire her?

This is the last place
I expected to see you.

46:05.960 --> 46:07.800
Sara, ma'am, I didn't know you were--

I'm told you're handling
the hiring of a replacement operator.

46:33.960 --> 46:36.480
You called everyone except me,
and I don't know why.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.600

I'll check the list tomorrow.

[Francisco]
I guess you remember this place.

46:47.360 --> 46:49.160
[Alba] Francisco, this doesn't make sense.

46:49.240 --> 46:52.040
[Francisco] I can't stop thinking
about the irony of all this.

46:52.120 --> 46:54.080
If I'd had a phone,
I could've called you.

46:54.160 --> 46:57.520
[Alba] It's not worth talking
about things you can't change.

46:59.600 --> 47:02.320
[Francisco] But it is, if it's about
what happens from now on.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.920
[Alba] Do you want me to tell you
what's going to happen?

47:08.200 --> 47:10.960
We'll recall our past and say goodbye.

47:11.040 --> 47:14.120
You'll go home to your mansion
and your pretty wife. And I'll--

47:14.200 --> 47:17.520

to find you

47:17.600 --> 47:21.320

waiting for you to come back.
