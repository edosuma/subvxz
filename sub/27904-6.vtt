WEBVTT

00:03.220 --> 00:05.309
Guys, the flip house
is really coming along.

00:05.353 --> 00:06.658
Yeah.DON:
After we sell it,

00:06.702 --> 00:07.964
I'm gonna use the money

00:08.008 --> 00:09.400
to buy a couples vacation
for me and Marcy.

00:09.444 --> 00:11.228
Oh, that's
really romantic, Don.

00:11.272 --> 00:15.232
Yeah. Marcy's going to the
Bahamas and I'm going to Mexico.

00:16.538 --> 00:19.236
How am I the divorced guy?

00:19.280 --> 00:21.412
Actually, we're gonna use
the money to buy a house

00:21.456 --> 00:24.372
and then repeat the process
until we own this city.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.330
Yeah-- well,
just the bad parts of the city.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.115
We can't afford the good parts.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.902
Okay. Inspection's all done.

00:32.945 --> 00:35.426
All right. Yes.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.559
We failed?

00:37.602 --> 00:38.908
Wha-- how could that be?

00:38.951 --> 00:42.085
Did you not see the six-pack
I left in your truck?

00:42.129 --> 00:44.522
The inside pipes are up to code,

00:44.566 --> 00:47.134
but your sewer line to the
street needs to be replaced.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.874
And for next time,

00:48.918 --> 00:50.659
I'm a wine guy.

00:52.748 --> 00:55.142
That means we have to tear
up the whole driveway.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.839
We can't afford that.

00:56.882 --> 01:01.104
We already used our airline
miles to buy the doorknobs.

01:01.148 --> 01:04.412
I feel bad. I'm the one who
convinced you to buy this house.

01:04.455 --> 01:06.196
It's kind of my fault.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.590
What-- no, Andi, no.
It's nobody's fault.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.200
But this whole sewer thing,

01:10.244 --> 01:11.593
that's gonna run, like,
20 grand.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.073
Way to go, Andi.

01:16.250 --> 01:19.818
Look at this budget. How are we
gonna come up with 20 grand?

01:19.862 --> 01:22.517
Well, can't we just tack it
onto our construction loan?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.432
We're at our limit
with the bank.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.216
When I pull up to the
drive-through, the teller

01:26.260 --> 01:29.480
turns off the microphone
and ducks behind the counter.

01:30.916 --> 01:33.310
If we can't finish this house,
we can't sell it.

01:33.354 --> 01:36.618
And if we can't sell it, we
could lose the whole business.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.620
No! I need this job.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.752
Since Jen and I split up,
she has all the money

01:40.796 --> 01:43.277
and the lawyer says
I can't have any.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.150
A-All right, everybody,
calm down.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.892
Let's all remember:
this is Andi's fault.

01:50.893 --> 01:52.721
All right, all right, all right.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.114
Let's not turn on each other.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.463
Pittsburgh has plenty of banks.

01:55.506 --> 01:57.465
Tomorrow, we'll just hit up
a bunch of them

01:57.508 --> 01:59.510
until we find one
that'll give us money.

01:59.554 --> 02:03.210
Or I know a guy down
at the track who lends money.

02:03.253 --> 02:04.820
One hitch:
if we can't pay him back,

02:04.863 --> 02:07.170
we'll have to kill him
before he kills us.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.346
ADAM:
All right.

02:09.390 --> 02:12.436
Let's call murdering
a guy plan B.

02:25.014 --> 02:26.189
Okay, huddle up, team.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.452
We need a new loan
to finish the flip house

02:28.496 --> 02:30.454
and I don't see any reason
we shouldn't get it.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.543
We are excellent at what we do,
people like us

02:32.587 --> 02:34.284
and we're good-looking.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.373
ANDI:
Okay, I made

02:36.417 --> 02:38.027
a list of banks.
We'll split up

02:38.070 --> 02:40.203
and get to as many as possible.All right.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.813
Oh, I got a good feeling
about this one.

02:41.857 --> 02:44.947
It's right next-door
to Hooters.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.427
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.603
I never heard of any of these.

02:48.646 --> 02:51.606
Yeah, well, I picked small ones.

02:51.649 --> 02:53.999
I'm hoping they're small
because they're not smart.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.741
All right,
that's the spirit, Andi.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.047
All right, come on,
we're burning daylight.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.222
Let's do this thing.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.529
Ugh, good. You're all here.

03:01.572 --> 03:03.748
I'm glad you're not busy.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.837
Uh, actually, Mom, we're right
in the middle of something.

03:05.881 --> 03:08.013
No, you can tell your story
after I tell mine.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.278
Your father is impossible.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.018
H-He just had
his knee operation.

03:13.062 --> 03:16.108
All he wants to do
is sit around.

03:16.152 --> 03:19.503
In fairness, he's recovering
from a major surgery.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.723
This seems like a family matter.
I'll wait in the car.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.727
Well, I thought
he was doing better.

03:25.770 --> 03:28.860
He was, but now he's
just back on the couch.

03:28.904 --> 03:29.992
I mean, I want

03:30.035 --> 03:31.994
to be known for my patience

03:32.037 --> 03:36.259
and consideration,
but that's just not my bag.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.696
So I'm going to my sister's.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.698
Isn't his
homecare nurse helping?

03:40.742 --> 03:43.658
If by helping, you mean
eating all my Milanos

03:43.701 --> 03:45.442
and finishing my
crossword puzzles,

03:45.486 --> 03:47.401
then yes, he's a
gift from heaven.

03:48.837 --> 03:52.014
I'm taking your crossword
for the train.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.146
Love to the grandbabies.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.062
What were we doing
before she came in?

03:57.106 --> 03:58.542
We were about
to lose our business.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.370
Oh, right. That thing Andi did.

04:04.069 --> 04:05.027
So you can see,
we're very serious.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.898
We have a solid
business plan,

04:06.942 --> 04:08.770
the house is almost done.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.642
A-And we're both wearing
ties.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.036
The trouble is,
you're at your loan limit.

04:14.079 --> 04:18.127
Right. That's why
we're both wearing ties.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.912
We think our project
has a lot of potential.

04:20.956 --> 04:23.045
And I'm thinking you might
be more likely to help us

04:23.088 --> 04:25.308
because we are haircut twins.

04:27.136 --> 04:30.444
Oh. Yeah, you're right.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.359
It's like you're
looking in a mirror

04:32.402 --> 04:34.578
that wants to give you
money-- a money mirror.

04:35.753 --> 04:38.016
So what are you thinking?

04:38.060 --> 04:41.585
I'm thinking I should
grow out my hair.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.718
I'm not sure you have
enough collateral.

04:43.761 --> 04:46.198
We may be small,
but we're not dumb.

04:46.242 --> 04:48.810
Nobody said you were dumb.

04:48.853 --> 04:51.987
Though we are hoping
for desperate.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.467
Look, we have other options.

04:53.510 --> 04:56.687
We just don't want
to have to kill a guy.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.907
So you have all the numbers.

04:58.950 --> 05:00.256
What do you say?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.040
No.

05:02.084 --> 05:03.520
No.

05:03.564 --> 05:04.869
No.

05:04.913 --> 05:07.611
Please?
No.

05:07.655 --> 05:09.309
Maybe...

05:09.352 --> 05:12.007
Oh, wait. I didn't see that. No.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.056
No, no, no.

05:19.275 --> 05:20.058
ANDI:
That loan guy

05:20.102 --> 05:21.016
left with our application.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.061
That is not a good sign.

05:23.105 --> 05:25.107
Do you hear anybody
laughing out there?

05:25.150 --> 05:29.241
I haven't been rejected
this much since middle school.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.461
And high school...
and when my wife left.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.724
I should be used to this by now.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.553
Thanks for waiting.

05:37.902 --> 05:40.644
So? How bad is it?

05:40.688 --> 05:42.690
Actually, I think we can
do something with this.

05:42.733 --> 05:45.388
Okay, I'm sorry--
wait. Wait.

05:45.432 --> 05:48.609
Did you just say not "no"?

05:48.652 --> 05:50.567
I'm gonna need
to run some numbers...

05:50.611 --> 05:52.264
He's running numbers.
He's running numbers!

05:52.308 --> 05:55.703
He's getting a calculator.All right, be cool, Lowell.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.967
Sorry. It's just, this loan
is really important to us.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.099
Well, I'll be honest,
it's not a slam dunk,

06:01.143 --> 06:03.841
but you've got a spark.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.582
I have a good feeling about you.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.279
You seem hard-working.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.759
I am hard-working.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.065
And dedicated.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.937
Super-duper dedicated.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.809
Do you need to write that
on there? Or, y-you'll remember.

06:14.852 --> 06:17.551
He'll remember. He'll...

06:20.118 --> 06:22.077
Ah. Crosscourt smash.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.209
Suck on that, Funchy.Hey.

06:24.253 --> 06:26.037
Watch the language.
This is Wimbledon.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.648
The queen's in the audience.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.258
Oh, no, my boys are here.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.303
Uh, hide the fun.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.222
Dad? Oh.Hey, guys.

06:37.266 --> 06:41.226
Joe's just been sitting here
in tremendous pain.

06:41.270 --> 06:43.620
Uh, sorry to bother you, Dad. We
need to borrow one of your ties.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.143
We got a couple more
banks to see,

06:45.187 --> 06:46.754
and Don got mayonnaise on his.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.452
I told you today of all days,
don't get extra mayonnaise.

06:49.496 --> 06:52.107
It was a turkey sandwich.
That bird gave his life

06:52.150 --> 06:54.239
and I'm not gonna
put mayonnaise on him?

06:54.283 --> 06:55.284
Don't be disrespectful.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.766
How's the leg, Dad?

06:58.809 --> 07:00.071
Oh, not good.

07:00.115 --> 07:02.422
And Funchy's
pushing me too hard.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.859
Hey, I'm here to kick ass
and eat Milanos,

07:04.902 --> 07:07.035
and I'm all out
of Milanos.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.472
Ooh.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.040
Hey, Andi. How's it going?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.085
I have a not no.

07:14.129 --> 07:17.045
That's amazing.
So far, all we got is noes.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.786
Well, one bank took our picture,

07:18.829 --> 07:20.744
but I think that's to make sure
we never come back.

07:20.788 --> 07:23.791
Okay, well, let me keep
working on this and...

07:23.834 --> 07:26.663
Okay, you-- listen,
you got this. Okay?

07:26.707 --> 07:27.969
Be confident, but not cocky.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.666
Stay calm,
but it's all up to you.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.973
It's life or death.
Just have fun.

07:35.933 --> 07:37.935
So, what do you think, James?

07:37.979 --> 07:40.416
Well, uh, this
is a tricky one.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.984
Uh, but sometimes, you just got
to go with your gut.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.334
Don't tell the squares upstairs,

07:45.377 --> 07:47.379
but I'm a bit of a vibe guy.

07:47.423 --> 07:51.166
Oh. Well, we are a
very pro-vibe company.

07:51.209 --> 07:53.734
Absolutely.
I'm vibrating right now.

07:53.777 --> 07:56.737
So, um, what's the next step?

07:56.780 --> 07:58.173
Well, there's a lot
to go through,

07:58.216 --> 08:00.044
and I have meetings
the rest of the day.

08:00.088 --> 08:03.178
I'd say come back tomorrow,
but Karen's here then,

08:03.221 --> 08:06.181
and she has zero vibes.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.487
What if we met

08:07.530 --> 08:09.053
to talk about it over dinner?

08:09.097 --> 08:12.579
You mean, like,
a real business dinner?

08:12.622 --> 08:14.363
I've never had one of those--
I mean, I have, I have.

08:14.406 --> 08:16.844
I've had so many, it's
like, ugh. But, uh,

08:16.887 --> 08:19.629
I've just never had one of those
scheduled for tonight,

08:19.673 --> 08:22.632
i.e. I'm free.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.199
I'd invite you, too, but, uh,

08:24.242 --> 08:26.680
she seems like the boss,
am I wrong about that?

08:26.723 --> 08:28.899
No. I'm not allowed
to make any decisions.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.945
That's how smart she is.Mm.

08:33.425 --> 08:36.298
Look at you, all ready
for your first business dinner.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.039
I know you don't like it
when I say "You go, girl,"

08:38.082 --> 08:40.389
so I'll just say it in my head.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.870
You go, girl.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.220
I heard that.

08:45.263 --> 08:47.396
I couldn't keep it in,
I'm too excited.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.876
I can't wait to tell Adam.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.921
Oh, no, no.
No, you can't tell Adam.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.054
Uh-uh. No. He
wouldn't understand.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.099
I mean, even though
it's a business dinner,

08:55.143 --> 08:58.015
all he'll hear is that
I'm going out with another guy.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.278
I can't keep a secret from Adam.
He's my hero.

09:00.322 --> 09:03.412
Jimmy Olsen never lied
to Superman.

09:03.455 --> 09:06.546
Look, he gets jealous,
even when there's no reason.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.417
One time, at a concert,
the singer said,

09:08.460 --> 09:10.158
"This one goes out
to all the ladies,"

09:10.201 --> 09:12.856
and Adam was in a bad mood
the whole night.

09:14.162 --> 09:17.165
He said he knew Billy Joel
was talking to me.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.167
I saw Billy Joel
in New York once.

09:19.210 --> 09:21.909
He said, "Get out of my way."

09:21.952 --> 09:24.912
Look, I just want
to get this loan, come home

09:24.955 --> 09:26.696
and surprise Adam
when it's all done.

09:26.740 --> 09:29.307
Which is why I need you
to cover for me.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.701
Just tell him, uh,
I went to the mall or something.

09:31.745 --> 09:34.704
No, I can't handle
that kind of stress.

09:34.748 --> 09:39.970
In high school, I was voted most
likely to panic and pass out.

09:40.014 --> 09:43.539
When I was presented
with the award, I passed out.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.194
Well, I believe in you.

09:46.237 --> 09:47.630
Don't.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.458
You can do this.

09:49.501 --> 09:50.764
I can't.

09:50.807 --> 09:54.985
Lowell... you go, guy.

09:57.031 --> 09:59.076
Well, now I have to try.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.431
Maybe we would have had
a shot at that last bank

10:06.475 --> 10:09.652
if you didn't have
ice cream all over you.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.046
A tie is not a napkin.

10:12.089 --> 10:14.135
Agree to disagree.Oh...

10:14.178 --> 10:16.224
Oh, hey, Lowell.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.529
Hey, uh, where's Andi?

10:30.673 --> 10:32.109
You had to call me?
You guys couldn't think

10:32.153 --> 10:34.503
to do this yourselves?

10:34.546 --> 10:37.114
Well, we didn't know what to do
after we made fun of him.

10:39.247 --> 10:41.075
Yeah, Andi wasn't here.
Where is Andi?

10:41.118 --> 10:43.207
Why do you think I'm lying?

10:45.383 --> 10:46.428
What?

10:46.471 --> 10:48.996
Fine. I wasn't supposed
to tell you,

10:49.039 --> 10:50.606
but since you can see
right through me,

10:50.650 --> 10:52.782
she went to dinner
with the loan officer.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.393
Why wouldn't Andi want me
to know that?

10:55.437 --> 10:57.047
I'm sure it's a very nice lady.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.312
It's a guy. Okay?

11:01.356 --> 11:03.271
The loan officer is a guy.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.665
What?!

11:07.144 --> 11:08.842
Every guy is after her.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.235
This-this is Billy Joel
all over again.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.717
No, no, it's not like that.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.501
I met the loan guy.
He's harmless.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.895
You better have
just said "armless."

11:21.028 --> 11:22.377
It's a business dinner.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.379
Is that what he told her?

11:24.422 --> 11:26.207
Let me tell you something,
Lowell.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.253
If it's a guy and a dinner,
at a table, with a waiter,

11:29.297 --> 11:30.994
it's a date.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.256
He's right.

11:32.300 --> 11:33.823
Restaurants are where
women fall in love.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.303
They watch you eat.
If they can handle it,

11:35.346 --> 11:36.217
then they mate with you.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.307
Where'd they go?

11:39.350 --> 11:40.917
Moonbeams.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.223
Moonbeams?!

11:42.266 --> 11:45.400
That's the most romantic
place in town.

11:45.443 --> 11:47.010
I'm afraid to take Andi there

11:47.054 --> 11:49.317
'cause we got
three kids already.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.275
I'm going down there
to bust this up.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.234
What? Wait. Why?

11:53.277 --> 11:55.410
This guy is taking
advantage of her.

11:55.453 --> 11:58.500
Andi doesn't know how
business creeps operate.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.763
She only sees the
best in people.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.547
It's one of her worst traits.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.507
But we need the loan.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.815
Are you saying my wife is
less valuable than money?

12:08.858 --> 12:10.555
Yes.

12:11.992 --> 12:13.428
I mean, we-we have
plenty of Andi.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.952
What we don't have
is money.

12:15.996 --> 12:20.261
Your problem is you are not
sensitive, like me.

12:20.304 --> 12:23.394
Now, I am gonna go down there
and rearrange this guy's face

12:23.438 --> 12:26.789
like Mr. Potato Head.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.400
I better follow him, make sure
he doesn't do anything stupid.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.795
Let him go.
He loves his wife.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.449
If you don't move
out of my way,

12:34.492 --> 12:37.539
I will pick my
teeth with you.

12:37.582 --> 12:41.238
You know what, Marcy?

12:44.285 --> 12:46.678
You go. I'm gonna stay here
and make fun of him.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.777
James, I appreciate you
taking the time to meet me.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.387
I-I put together
all the documents

12:59.430 --> 13:00.867
on our property.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.478
Yes, it's in my daughter's
princess binder,

13:03.521 --> 13:05.828
but it says,
"Always stay magical."

13:05.872 --> 13:08.396
I think that's
good advice for anybody.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.354
Well, this is
definitely a first.

13:10.398 --> 13:11.921
But it doesn't matter
what's onthe binder,

13:11.965 --> 13:14.228
it's what's inside
that matters.

13:14.271 --> 13:15.795
Oh, more stickers.

13:15.838 --> 13:19.233
I'm not trying to bribe you,
but you approve our loan,

13:19.276 --> 13:21.278
you'll get a gold star.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.155
Dad?

13:28.198 --> 13:31.071
I'm afraid you got
the wrong guy, partner.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.943
What are you doing here?
I thought you couldn't walk.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.598
Okay, you got me.
But don't tell your mother.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.383
If she knows I'm okay,
she'll make Funchy leave.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.255
Medicare pays for
two more weeks.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.866
But if your knee is healed,
you don't need him anymore.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.956
I made a friend,
and I'm not giving him back.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.785
Well, thanks for including me
in your insurance scam.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.266
I think you've got
some bigger problems.

13:52.309 --> 13:55.356
Looks like your wife is
stepping out with another guy.

13:55.399 --> 13:59.142
I was gonna text you,
but my steak came.

13:59.186 --> 14:02.102
I know all about it.
I'm here to break it up.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.582
Geez.

14:04.626 --> 14:05.888
Where do you think you're going?

14:05.932 --> 14:07.716
To give that guy
a piece of my mind.

14:07.759 --> 14:09.370
You're not getting past me.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.154
I've been eating ramen
for six weeks

14:11.198 --> 14:12.460
because of this flip house.

14:12.503 --> 14:13.983
My sodium is through the roof

14:14.027 --> 14:15.071
and I'm feeling crazy strong.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.682
Okay, Marcy,
I cannot let my wife

14:17.726 --> 14:19.293
be on a date with another guy.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.903
They are not on a date.
Look at them.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.078
It's a public place.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.210
Nothing is going on.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.344
He's pouring her wine.
That is a date!

14:27.388 --> 14:29.520
Your dad and Funchy
are having wine.

14:29.564 --> 14:31.087
Is that a date?

14:31.131 --> 14:33.524
I don't know, it looks
pretty romantic over there.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.831
They're sharing
a wedge salad.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.180
Here, you can have
all the bacon.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.922
Oh, you get me.
Yeah.

14:39.966 --> 14:40.923
Hmm?

14:40.967 --> 14:42.838
J-Just before you
go over there,

14:42.882 --> 14:46.189
I want to remind you how
important this loan is to us.

14:46.233 --> 14:48.017
At least hear my side
of the story.

14:48.061 --> 14:49.932
Okay, you have two minutes.

14:49.976 --> 14:53.936
Okay, so, the year was 1974,

14:53.980 --> 14:56.330
and a pair of professors
who thought they were barren

14:56.373 --> 14:59.333
gave birth to a miracle baby
named Marcy.

14:59.376 --> 15:01.726
This pie chart is
very well done.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.947
Oh, yeah, well, hope...
hope you're not on a diet.

15:07.167 --> 15:08.908
You know, 'cause
it's a piechart.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.215
ADAM:
She's laughing.

15:12.259 --> 15:13.434
What's she laughing at?

15:13.477 --> 15:15.001
Well, maybe he told her a joke.Yeah--

15:15.044 --> 15:16.872
She doesn't laugh
at my jokes like that.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.917
Last week I told her the one

15:17.960 --> 15:19.353
about Mr. T in
the haunted house.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.921
"I pity the ghoul."

15:21.964 --> 15:23.357
Ghoul is another word for ghost.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.358
He used to say,
"I pity the fool."

15:24.401 --> 15:26.447
Aw, forget it.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.362
I just wish I could hear

15:28.405 --> 15:29.406
what they're talking about.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.409
Ooh, I see an opening.

15:32.453 --> 15:34.846
No, no...Shh!

15:40.243 --> 15:43.768
Oh, don't mind me,
I'm a, uh, seat warmer.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.596
That's how fancy this place is.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.382
Not a cold butt since 1987.

15:52.212 --> 15:54.214
Ladies.

15:59.219 --> 16:03.092
Oh, for God's sakes.
Adam.

16:05.486 --> 16:08.880
Well, well, well.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.012
What are you doing here?

16:10.056 --> 16:11.927
I'll tell you what
I'm doing here.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.061
This is not a business dinner.
This is a date.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.585
You are preying on
an innocent woman in need,

16:17.628 --> 16:20.544
because you are a slimy,
scheming...

16:20.588 --> 16:23.330
friendly-looking guy.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.201
You don't seem that threatening.

16:25.245 --> 16:27.334
This is ridiculous.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.162
I mean, after 18 years
of marriage,

16:29.205 --> 16:32.295
I can't have dinner
with a business associate?

16:32.339 --> 16:34.384
This is not Billy Joel.

16:34.428 --> 16:36.604
Billy Joel hit on me
one night.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.475
That's pretty cool.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.523
I am trying to save
our business,

16:42.566 --> 16:45.265
and all you're doing is making
us both look like amateurs.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.354
I think I can clear this up.

16:47.397 --> 16:49.443
Oh, thank you, James.

16:49.486 --> 16:50.705
This is a date.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.924
Ha! I knew it.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.318
I assume the worst in people.
That's one of mybest traits.

16:55.362 --> 16:59.235
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wha-What about the loan?

16:59.279 --> 17:01.455
I ran it past Karen
this afternoon.

17:01.498 --> 17:04.284
She said no, but I was
still jazzed about our date.

17:04.327 --> 17:09.419
It wasn't a date.
I am married.

17:09.463 --> 17:11.682
Yeah, it doesn't bother me.Oh...

17:11.726 --> 17:14.598
You gotta knock on the door
if you want it to open.

17:14.642 --> 17:16.818
I'm not a door.
Are you hearing him?

17:16.861 --> 17:18.602
Hey, I'm just happy
I was right about this.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.300
I got really sweaty there
for a second.

17:20.343 --> 17:23.303
But I'll gladly take him outside
and tune him up, if you want.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.610
No.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.265
I'm not gonna waste my time
on some jerk who,

17:29.309 --> 17:30.745
in this day and age,
still tries to use

17:30.788 --> 17:33.313
a position of power
to manipulate people.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.532
And, you know, I wouldn't
normally do this

17:35.576 --> 17:37.491
to an innocent glass
of wine, but...

17:37.534 --> 17:39.145
Ooh!

17:40.363 --> 17:41.538
Oops.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.585
That was awesome.Hmm.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.024
That's why all the guys
are after her.

17:52.810 --> 17:56.162
So you failed to seduce
the bank guy.

17:58.425 --> 17:59.295
I wasn't trying, Don.

17:59.339 --> 18:02.081
Oh, now you weren't trying.

18:02.124 --> 18:05.258
Did you even listen
to the story?

18:05.301 --> 18:07.651
The bad news is we're
back where we started.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.392
No money, no loan.

18:09.436 --> 18:12.482
Now Don and I will
have to vacation together.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.356
Honey, I'm sorry I got
so jealous tonight.

18:16.399 --> 18:18.227
Obviously, you can
take care of yourself.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.315
Oh, that's okay.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.751
I mean, you were
right about him.

18:20.795 --> 18:24.407
Just like Billy Joel.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.584
"This one goes out
to all the ladies."

18:27.628 --> 18:30.109
He was looking right at you.

18:30.152 --> 18:33.024
Hey, guys.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.114
Why the long faces?

18:35.157 --> 18:36.158
Why are you so cheerful?

18:36.202 --> 18:38.247
Did you pass out
in a flower patch?

18:40.945 --> 18:43.034
Actually, I have some good news.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.167
When Adam left for the
restaurant, I had a feeling

18:45.211 --> 18:47.952
the deal might go south, and it
was time for extreme measures.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.781
So I went to see my ex, Jen,

18:50.825 --> 18:52.957
and I told her I wanted $20,000.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.394
You didn't.

18:54.437 --> 18:56.961
I did. And I told her
if she didn't give it to me,

18:57.005 --> 18:59.094
I would tell her grandma
that she cheated on me

18:59.138 --> 19:01.140
with her horse riding
instructor.

19:01.183 --> 19:04.143
Nobody wants their nana to know
they did it in a barn.

19:06.101 --> 19:08.669
Anyhoo, the money's already
in my account.

19:08.712 --> 19:12.151
Lowell, you just saved
our company. That's great.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.109
I mean, that's blackmail.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.502
It is?
Yeah.

19:15.545 --> 19:18.722
I'll be right back.

19:18.766 --> 19:19.984
Oh, oh...
No.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.553
No. Oh...

19:33.694 --> 19:36.218
Oh, geez, Bev's home.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.828
Oh...

19:40.657 --> 19:42.746
I'm back.

19:42.790 --> 19:43.704
Hi, dear.

19:43.747 --> 19:46.141
I'd get up, but I can't.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.926
His leg's not getting
any better.
Yeah.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.493
Looks like Funchy's gonna
have to stay around

19:50.537 --> 19:51.929
a little while longer.

19:51.973 --> 19:55.716
You're propping up
the wrong leg, Joe.

19:58.501 --> 19:59.546
That was your one job!
