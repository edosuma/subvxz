WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:03.134
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:03.134 --> 00:05.676
(whispers)
THE COPS ARE COMING.
 A WORD OF WARNING...

00:05.676 --> 00:08.039
GO OUT THE BACK NOW.
 LED TO AN ESCAPE.

00:08.039 --> 00:11.042
I HATE HER.
 A DAUGHTER'S WORDS...

00:11.042 --> 00:14.014
(crying) DADDY, I'M SORRY!
PLEASE!
 LED TO HER DEPARTURE.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.716
(Wayne)
HOW MANY STITCHES IS THAT?
 11.

00:15.716 --> 00:18.089
AND YOU DIDN'T CRY ONCE.

00:18.089 --> 00:20.621
AND A FATHER'S REVELATION...
 OW! DAD, YOU'RE HURTING ME.

00:20.621 --> 00:25.096
LED TO EXTREME RETRIBUTION.

00:25.096 --> 00:28.329
I'M WAYNE DAVIS, AND WE'RE
ABOUT TO HAVE SOME FUN.

00:32.162 --> 00:34.465
(Mary Alice)
IT HAD BEEN 14 YEARS

00:34.465 --> 00:38.069
SINCE KATHERINE MAYFAIR
HAD BEEN IN A POLICE STATION,

00:38.069 --> 00:40.371
BUT SHE REMEMBERED
THE CONVERSATION

00:40.371 --> 00:43.043
LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.045
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME WATER, HONEY?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.046
THANKS.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.548
SO... I TAKE IT

00:47.548 --> 00:51.082
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
YOUR HUSBAND'S HIT YOU?

00:51.082 --> 00:55.226
HE KEEPS PROMISING TO STOP,
BUT IT JUST GETS WORSE.

00:55.226 --> 00:58.429
AND I'M AFRAID HE'S GONNA
DO SOMETHING TO MY DAUGHTER.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.763
PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.465
HAVE YOU
REPORTED HIM BEFORE?

01:04.465 --> 01:06.467
ONCE, BUT WHEN I CALLED,

01:06.467 --> 01:09.500
THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T
FIND THE PAPERWORK.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.172
OH.

01:11.172 --> 01:14.505
YOUR HUSBAND'S WAYNE DAVIS,
ONE OF OUR PATROLMEN.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.211
WANT SOME ADVICE?

01:22.283 --> 01:25.116
WAYNE'S GOT A LOT OF FRIENDS
AROUND HERE.

01:25.116 --> 01:27.258
OF COURSE YOU CAN
PRESS CHARGES, BUT...

01:27.258 --> 01:28.559
I CAN'T GUARANTEE

01:28.559 --> 01:31.692
THAT ONE OF HISFRIENDS
 WON'T LOSE THE PAPERWORK AGAIN.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.125
THEN WHAT SHOULD I DO?

01:34.125 --> 01:37.528
GET AS MUCH MONEY
AS YOU CAN LAY YOUR HANDS ON,

01:37.528 --> 01:39.200
GRAB YOUR DAUGHTER...

01:39.200 --> 01:40.731
AND RUN.

01:44.435 --> 01:47.878
AND SO SHE DID...

01:47.878 --> 01:51.712
TO A PLACE
SHE THOUGHT WOULD BE SAFE.

01:55.146 --> 01:58.118
MRS. MAYFAIR?

01:58.118 --> 02:01.352
I'M DETECTIVE ROMSLO.
CAN I HELP YOU?

02:01.352 --> 02:04.355
WHY EXACTLY WOULD YOU THINK
THAT DR. MAYFAIR WAS KIDNAPPED?

02:04.355 --> 02:06.357
NO ONE
IN THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT

02:06.357 --> 02:08.359
HEARD OR SAW
ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS.

02:08.359 --> 02:13.164
THAT'S BECAUSE THE MAN
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS--MY EX--

02:13.164 --> 02:16.307
KNOWS A LITTLE SOMETHING
ABOUT HOW TO COMMIT A CRIME.

02:16.307 --> 02:17.608
HE'S A COP.

02:17.608 --> 02:19.310
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

02:19.310 --> 02:21.812
WAYNE DAVIS.

02:21.812 --> 02:23.744
(sighs)

02:23.744 --> 02:26.277
WHAT?

02:26.277 --> 02:28.279
(chuckles)

02:30.251 --> 02:31.882
WELL, IT'S JUST, UH...

02:31.882 --> 02:34.385
I KNOW WAYNE.
WE'VE HUNG OUT TOGETHER.

02:34.385 --> 02:36.387
HE'S A HELL OF A GOLFER.

02:36.387 --> 02:39.390
WELL, BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU
HE WASN'T A HELL OF A HUSBAND.

02:39.390 --> 02:41.892
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

02:41.892 --> 02:44.895
SOME PAYBACK FOR
AN ANCIENT DOMESTIC DISPUTE?

02:44.895 --> 02:49.540
PLEASE.
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

02:49.540 --> 02:52.573
BECAUSE ONCE WAYNE
IS DONE WITH ADAM,

02:52.573 --> 02:54.575
HE'S GOING TO COME AFTER ME.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.908
AND THIS TIME,
HE'S GONNA KILL ME. I KNOW IT.

03:00.351 --> 03:03.214
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

03:03.214 --> 03:07.258
IF YOU WOULD JUST, UH,
FILL OUT THIS PAPERWORK...

03:07.258 --> 03:13.664
IN THAT MOMENT, KATHERINE KNEW
EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD TO DO...

03:13.664 --> 03:15.366
AGAIN.

03:15.366 --> 03:18.369
MOM, STOP.
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.
 THERE'S NO TIME.

03:18.369 --> 03:20.401
WAYNE IS COMING.
HE TOOK ADAM. WE'RE NEXT.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.404
BUT WHY? WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
AND IF WE'RE IN SO MUCH DANGER,

03:23.404 --> 03:26.907
THEN WHY AREN'T WE CALLING
THE POLICE?
 THE POLICE WILL NOT HELP.
DYLAN, PLEASE!

03:26.907 --> 03:30.411
GO PACK YOUR THINGS. WE NEED
TO BE GONE BEFORE HE GETS HERE.
 STOP!

03:30.411 --> 03:35.386
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE UNTIL
YOU TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

03:35.386 --> 03:38.218
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE
AFRAID OF MY FATHER?

03:38.218 --> 03:39.520
KATHERINE MAYFAIR

03:39.520 --> 03:43.554
HAD BEEN RUNNING FROM THE TRUTH
FOR A LONG TIME...

03:43.554 --> 03:45.426
OKAY.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.899
I'LL TELL YOU.

03:48.899 --> 03:50.261
NO!

03:50.261 --> 03:52.463
DYLAN. I'M SORRY!
I HAD NO CHOICE!
 NO!

03:55.766 --> 03:57.308
DYLAN!

03:57.308 --> 04:11.822
AND IT HAD FINALLY
CAUGHT UP WITH HER.

04:11.822 --> 04:15.886
THERE'S A RITUAL MY FRIENDS
HAVE OBSERVED FOR YEARS.

04:15.886 --> 04:18.488
ONCE A WEEK, THEY MEET
TO PLAY A GAME OF CARDS

04:18.488 --> 04:20.891
AND TALK ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

04:20.891 --> 04:23.694
THERE'S ALWAYS
LAUGHTER AND WINE...

04:23.694 --> 04:26.036
AND TALK ABOUT THE NEIGHBORS.

04:26.036 --> 04:29.440
NO WAY, BREE. I DON'T WANT
KATHERINE IN OUR GAMES.

04:29.440 --> 04:32.303
SHE BUMS ME OUT.
 OH, I'M WITH GABY.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW ME.

04:32.303 --> 04:35.376
I ALWAYS LIKE TO GIVE PEOPLE
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT...
 NO, YOU DON'T.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.378
NO, I DON'T,
BUT LET'S SAY I DID.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.450
KATHERINE HAS
THIS ALOOF QUALITY.

04:39.450 --> 04:42.453
IT'S LIKE SHE'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO KEEP US AT ARM'S LENGTH.
 WELL, I HAVE TO AGREE.

04:42.453 --> 04:43.984
SHE'S CHANGED.
SHE'S NOT THAT FUN ANYMORE.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.986
LADIES, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.989
KATHERINE HAS ALL SORTS
OF WONDERFUL QUALITIES.
 NAME ONE, AND KEEP IN MIND

04:48.989 --> 04:51.762
THAT "ALOOF" AND "UNFUN"
HAVE ALREADY BEEN TAKEN.

04:51.762 --> 04:54.365
WELL, I ADMIT SHE PLAYS
HER CARDS CLOSE TO THE VEST,

04:54.365 --> 04:57.498
BUT SOME OF YOU COULD BENEFIT
FROM THAT KIND OF QUIET DIGNITY,

04:57.498 --> 05:00.300
MISS I-CHEW-GUM-
LIKE-A-1930s-GUN-MOLL.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.502
(snaps gum loudly)

05:01.502 --> 05:04.074
BREE, YOU CAN TALK KATHERINE UP
ALL YOU WANT,

05:04.074 --> 05:06.377
BUT SHE IS JUST NEVER
GONNA BE ONE OF US.
 (front door opens)

05:06.377 --> 05:09.309
(Katherine) ANYBODY HOME?
 (door shuts)

05:09.309 --> 05:11.682
OH. (chuckles)

05:11.682 --> 05:15.686
HI! WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.
 RANDOM CHITCHAT,
NOTHING SPECIFIC.

05:15.686 --> 05:18.689
THAT'S NICE. COULD I
TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE?

05:18.689 --> 05:21.952
HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON?
 OKAY, I KNOW IT'S LAST MINUTE,

05:21.952 --> 05:23.954
BUT I HAVE TO LEAVE TOWN,
SO I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE

05:23.954 --> 05:27.698
TO HELP YOU CATER
THE COMMITMENT CEREMONY.
 IT'S TOMORROW!

05:27.698 --> 05:29.700
A HUNDRED GAY MEN
ARE DESCENDING ON THIS STREET,

05:29.700 --> 05:32.332
AND THEY'RE EXPECTING
A FABULOUS PARTY.
 I FEEL AWFUL,

05:32.332 --> 05:35.105
BUT I WOULDN'T BAIL ON YOU
IF IT WEREN'T IMPORTANT.

05:35.105 --> 05:37.538
OKAY. WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:37.538 --> 05:40.340
I CAN'T TELL YOU.
AGAIN, I'M SO SORRY.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.012
GOOD LUCK.

05:43.874 --> 05:45.816
(front door opens)

05:47.718 --> 05:48.849
(door shuts)

05:50.451 --> 05:53.454
ALL RIGHT, YOU CAN ALL WIPE
THOSE SMUG LOOKS OFF YOUR FACES,

05:53.454 --> 05:56.056
BECAUSE EVERY ONE OF YOU
HAS JUST BECOME MY EMPLOYEE.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.688
(snaps gum)

05:57.688 --> 05:59.960
(door shuts)

05:59.960 --> 06:03.464
HEY, YOU GOT ANY PLANS TOMORROW
AT 5:00 A.M.? 'CAUSE NOW YOU DO.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.797
BREE NEEDS ABOUT TWO TRUCKLOADS
OF FLOWERS PICKED UP FROM...

06:06.797 --> 06:08.639
WHAT?

06:08.639 --> 06:11.672
GUESS WHO GOT OFF
THE WAIT-LIST AT PRINCETON!

06:11.672 --> 06:14.144
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!

06:14.144 --> 06:16.707
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU! (gasps)

06:16.707 --> 06:19.710
OKAY, I AM GOING TO NEED
A BUMPER STICKER RIGHT AWAY

06:19.710 --> 06:23.484
SO I CAN START ANNOYING
ALL THE OTHER PARENTS!
 SURE. I'LL SNAG YOU ONE
WHEN I GET THERE ON TUESDAY.

06:23.484 --> 06:27.117
(laughs) TUESDAY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
 OKAY, YOU KNOW THAT PROFESSOR
WHO READ MY SENIOR THESIS?

06:27.117 --> 06:29.119
WELL, HE WAS SO IMPRESSED

06:29.119 --> 06:32.122
THAT HE ASKED ME TO COME OUT
AND DO A SUMMER INTERNSHIP.

06:32.122 --> 06:33.624
I'M LEAVING NEXT WEEK.

06:33.624 --> 06:36.026
NEXT WEEK?
W-WELL, THAT IS A BIG...

06:36.026 --> 06:37.397
NO.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.431
NO? MOM, I HAVE TO.
IT'S A HUGE HONOR.

06:40.431 --> 06:42.172
YES... TO BE CHOSEN,

06:42.172 --> 06:44.404
AND YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.736
SO CONGRATULATIONS,

06:45.736 --> 06:47.478
AND YOU'RE STAYING HOME.

06:47.478 --> 06:49.480
OH, YOU'RE NOT
LETTING HER GO?

06:49.480 --> 06:51.512
BUT IT'S A HUGE HONOR.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.545
YES, WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT.
IT'S HUGE. IT'S AN HONOR.

06:54.545 --> 06:56.016
WE GET IT.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.519
GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON
WHY I CAN'T GO.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.792
WELL, THE FIRST THING
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD...

07:01.792 --> 07:02.993
UH...

07:02.993 --> 07:05.055
WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

07:06.957 --> 07:09.560
SUSAN, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SEC?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.934
(lowered voice) YOU KNOW,
I JUST INHERITED 5 GRAND

07:13.934 --> 07:15.435
FROM GRANDPA MAYNARD,

07:15.435 --> 07:19.069
AND I... I'D REALLY LIKE
TO HELP JULIE DO THIS.

07:19.069 --> 07:21.011
MIKE, THAT IS SO SWEET.

07:21.011 --> 07:23.674
MIKE MAKES
ANOTHER GOOD POINT.

07:23.674 --> 07:25.676
WHO IS THIS PROFESSOR?

07:25.676 --> 07:27.548
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

07:27.548 --> 07:30.551
I AM CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO GIVE
MY DAUGHTER TO HIM FOR A SUMMER.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.753
I'M SORRY, JULIE.
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.454
THIS TOTALLY SUCKS.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.456
WELL, YES,
BUT DON'T FORGET--

07:36.456 --> 07:38.629
IT IS AHUGEHONOR.

07:41.592 --> 07:44.194
(mouths words)

07:44.194 --> 07:46.737
HEY.

07:46.737 --> 07:51.201
YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE

IN ONE AFTERNOON.

07:54.645 --> 07:56.507

07:56.507 --> 07:59.510
BREE'S IN A HORRIBLE JAM,

I'M TAKING THIS STUFF TO KAYLA,

08:08.118 --> 08:10.120
OKAY, SO AT THE RISK

08:10.120 --> 08:12.793
OF CRACKING THESE EGGSHELLS
I'VE BEEN WALKING ON ALL WEEK,

08:12.793 --> 08:15.866
ANY IDEA WHEN YOU'RE GONNA
STOP BEINGSOANGRY?

08:15.866 --> 08:17.868
I'M NOT ANGRY AT YOU.

08:17.868 --> 08:20.130
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T
HAVE A CHOICE, TOM.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.573
WE HAD TO GET HER
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

08:22.573 --> 08:24.575
I KNOW. I AM ANGRY
AT THE SITUATION.

08:24.575 --> 08:26.807
CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST LET ME BE ANGRY?

08:26.807 --> 08:30.240
FINE. YOU CAN BE AS ANGRY
AND SULKY AND PISSY AS YOU WANT,

08:30.240 --> 08:32.743

08:32.743 --> 08:35.245

08:35.245 --> 08:37.246
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TOLD

08:37.246 --> 08:39.750
THAT SOME WIVES
ASK THEIR HUSBANDS FOR FAVORS

08:39.750 --> 08:41.892
AND ACTUALLY SAY, "PLEASE."

08:41.892 --> 08:43.894
(chuckles) OH, TOM.

08:43.894 --> 08:47.157
DON'T YOU KNOW AN URBAN MYTH
WHEN YOU HEAR ONE?

08:49.059 --> 08:53.233
(wind chimes tinkling)
 OKAY, SO HERE'S THE DEAL.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.736
BREE NEEDS

08:58.238 --> 09:00.811
SO... I'M GONNA NEED YOU

09:00.811 --> 09:03.644
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE CREDIT CARD COMPANY.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.647
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT YOU WANNA TELL ME?

09:06.647 --> 09:10.250
MM... WELL, IT WOULD BE EASIER
IF I KNEW WHAT YOU KNEW.
 DAMN IT, GABY, ENOUGH SHOPPING!

09:10.250 --> 09:12.723
YOU'VE MAXED OUT
EVERY CREDIT CARD WE OWN.

09:12.723 --> 09:15.225
I MEAN,
WE ARE SO BROKE RIGHT NOW,

09:15.225 --> 09:19.559
IT'S GONNA BE A MIRACLE IF WE
DON'T END UP ON THE STREET.
 OKAY, WHEN YOU YELL AT ME,
I GET UPSET.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.562
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DO
WHEN I GET UPSET? I SHOP.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.565

09:25.565 --> 09:28.639
WHATEVER.
I'M GONNA GO READ PORN...

09:28.639 --> 09:30.140

09:34.745 --> 09:36.707
(ring, beep)

09:36.707 --> 09:37.577
HELLO?

09:37.577 --> 09:39.009
Gaby, it's Ellie.

09:39.009 --> 09:42.182
ELLIE, YOU CAN'T CALL ME!
THE COPS ARE ALL OVER MY ASS

09:42.182 --> 09:44.685
BECAUSE THEY THINK
I HELPED YOU ESCAPE.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.717
I'M SORRY.
I JUST NEED ONE MORE FAVOR,

09:46.717 --> 09:50.320
AND THEN I'LL NEVER
BOTHER YOU AGAIN.
 OH! ELLIE, I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT IS IT?

09:50.320 --> 09:52.823
I LEFT MY TEDDY BEAR
IN THE COAT CLOSET.

09:52.823 --> 09:56.897
I NEED YOU
TO BRING IT TO ME.
 TEDDY BEAR? WHAT IS THAT,
CODE FOR "A POUND OF BLOW"?

09:56.897 --> 09:59.730
NO, IT'S AN ACTUAL
TEDDY BEAR.

09:59.730 --> 10:02.733
MY DAD GAVE IT TO ME
WHEN I WAS 5,

10:02.733 --> 10:05.776
and it's the only thing
I have left to remember him by.

10:05.776 --> 10:07.638
CRAP.

10:07.638 --> 10:10.140
YA HAD TO PLAY
THE DADDY CARD.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.723
(crinkling)
 HMM.

10:26.797 --> 10:28.799
(rip)

10:38.138 --> 10:40.671
SO AFTER THE CEREMONY,
WE'LL OPEN UP THE BUFFET...

10:40.671 --> 10:43.173
MM-HMM. UH, CHICKEN MARSALA,
AND PASTA FOR THE VEGETARIANS.

10:43.173 --> 10:46.817
AND DANCING, ROLL OUT THE CAKE,
YOU LEAVE FOR YOUR HONEYMOON,

10:46.817 --> 10:49.379
AND I WILL COLLAPSE
IN A TASTEFUL HEAP. (chuckles)

10:49.379 --> 10:51.782
HOLD IT. YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE ICE SCULPTURE.

10:51.782 --> 10:54.725
OH! YES, I'M SORRY.
ONE CHERUB DELIVERED AT 1:30.

10:54.725 --> 10:56.687
CHERUB? NO,
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD KATHERINE

10:56.687 --> 10:59.229
WE WERE GONNA
GO WITH THE ENCHANTED CASTLE.

10:59.229 --> 11:01.291
AND I TOLD HER
WE'D GO WITH THE CHERUB

11:01.291 --> 11:04.434
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT
8-YEAR-OLD GIRLS.
 BOB, ALL MY LIFE

11:04.434 --> 11:06.697
I HAVE DREAMT OF HAVING
A WEDDING RECEPTION

11:06.697 --> 11:09.439
IN WHICH I WOULD SERVE DRINKS
FROM A VODKA MOAT

11:09.439 --> 11:11.441
SURROUNDING AN ENCHANTED CASTLE
RENDERED IN ICE,

11:11.441 --> 11:15.145
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK.
 REMEMBER WHEN YOU ASKED ME

11:15.145 --> 11:17.878
TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU
START ACTING LIKE FAYE DUNAWAY

11:17.878 --> 11:20.781
FROM THE BOARDROOM SCENE
IN "MOMMIE DEAREST"?

11:20.781 --> 11:23.153
UH, WHY DON'T I
LET YOU TWO WORK THIS OUT?

11:23.153 --> 11:27.758
FINE, WE'LL GO
WITH THE STUPID BABY ANGEL.

11:27.758 --> 11:30.190
I NEED SOME COFFEE.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.463
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
AND DON'T SAY FOR THE PIZZA,

11:33.463 --> 11:35.996
BECAUSE I KNOW
YOU'RE LACTOSE-INTOLERANT.

11:35.996 --> 11:37.998
I HEARD KATHERINE
LEFT YOU IN THE LURCH.

11:37.998 --> 11:41.271
I'M HERE
TO OFFER MY ASSISTANCE.
 OH, I GET IT.
SO I'M DESPERATE AND VULNERABLE,

11:41.271 --> 11:44.074
AND YOU'RE GONNA
SWOOP IN AND SAVE THE DAY.

11:44.074 --> 11:46.977
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I'M FINE.
 DARLING, DON'T BE STUBBORN.
YOU'RE GONNA NEED PLACE CARDS,

11:46.977 --> 11:50.710
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE
EXCELLENT PENMANSHIP.
 DON'T YOU DARE

11:50.710 --> 11:53.213
THROW YOUR CALLIGRAPHY SKILLS
IN MY FACE WHEN YOU KNOW

11:53.213 --> 11:57.147
I'M AT A LOW POINT.
NOW GO! AND STOP FOLLOWING ME.
 (sighs)

11:59.820 --> 12:02.052
YOU'RE DOOMED.

12:02.052 --> 12:04.855
EXCUSE ME?

12:04.855 --> 12:07.157
THE WAY YOU JUST CAVED
ON THAT SCULPTURE THING?

12:07.157 --> 12:10.901
YOU'RE SETTING THE TONE
FOR YOUR ENTIRE MARRIAGE.
 I AM?

12:10.901 --> 12:12.903
YEAH. YOU GOTTA
DIG IN YOUR HEELS.

12:12.903 --> 12:15.405
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE GONNA BE
PUSHED AROUND FOR THE NEXT...

12:15.405 --> 12:18.068
LET'S SEE. HOW LONG
HAVE I BEEN MARRIED?

12:18.068 --> 12:20.070
TEN AND A HALF YEARS.

12:23.513 --> 12:25.876
I WANT MY CASTLE.

12:25.876 --> 12:28.879
LEE...
 IT IS THEONLYTHING
I'VE ASKED FOR,

12:28.879 --> 12:31.451
AND DAMN IT,
I'M ENTITLED TO IT.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.483
FINE.

12:33.483 --> 12:35.355
OH.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.957
THANK YOU.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.860
(mouths word)

12:39.860 --> 12:44.494
ALL RIGHT, SO I WILL CALL
THE ICE SCULPTOR,

12:44.494 --> 12:48.268
AND SEE IF WE CAN--
 FORGET IT.
WE'RE STICKING WITH THE CHERUB.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.300
AND LATER,
WHEN HE BITCHES ABOUT IT,

12:50.300 --> 12:52.302
I'LL JUST
BUY HIM SOME JEWELRY.

12:52.302 --> 12:54.945
YOU SURE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN MARRIED BEFORE?

12:54.945 --> 12:56.446
HEY, GABY?

12:56.446 --> 12:58.108
OVER HERE, CARLOS.

12:58.108 --> 13:00.180
YOU KNOW, I GOT A THEORY

13:00.180 --> 13:03.183
AS TO WHY ALL THIS BAD STUFF
HAS HAPPENED TO US--

13:03.183 --> 13:05.886
MY BLINDNESS
AND LOSING ALL OUR MONEY...

13:05.886 --> 13:09.189
IT'S KARMA. YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN SELFISH AND GREEDY,

13:09.189 --> 13:12.322
AND THE UNIVERSE IS TELLING US
TO START BEING BETTER PEOPLE.

13:12.322 --> 13:16.566
I JUST FOUND $118,000
IN ELLIE'S TEDDY BEAR.

13:16.566 --> 13:18.929
HEY, UNIVERSE?

13:18.929 --> 13:20.400
BITE ME!

13:20.400 --> 13:21.902
(Wayne) Hello?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.803
HEY, WAYNE? IT'S PETE ROMSLO.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.876
PETE! HOW'S TRICKS?

13:25.876 --> 13:27.908
Listen, uh,
I'm just calling

13:27.908 --> 13:29.910
TO GIVE YOU A HEADS-UP.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.943
UM, I FINALLY MET YOUR EX.
SHE CAME IN TO FILE A REPORT.

13:32.943 --> 13:35.445
(chuckles) APPARENTLY,
YOU, UH, KIDNAPPED HER HUSBAND.

13:35.445 --> 13:38.418
NO KIDDING? AM I ASKING
FOR RANSOM? (laughs)

13:38.418 --> 13:40.921
WELL, YOU ALWAYS SAID
SHE WAS CRAZY.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.923
NOW I FEEL YOUR PAIN.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.926
ANYWAY, I-I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW, HUH? TAKE CARE.
 Thanks.

13:47.297 --> 13:48.498
(beep)

13:48.498 --> 13:50.460
(phone clatters)

13:50.460 --> 13:53.103
(thud)
 OKAY, ENOUGH KIDDIN' AROUND.

13:53.103 --> 13:56.406
TELL ME
WHERE MY DAUGHTER IS.

13:59.309 --> 14:02.072
OH, FOR--

14:03.573 --> 14:05.946
DID YOU DIE ON ME?

14:07.247 --> 14:09.149
(thud)

14:09.149 --> 14:11.581
(sighs)

14:11.581 --> 14:12.883
(thud)
 DAMN IT!

14:12.883 --> 14:15.225
(sighs)

14:15.225 --> 14:17.227
(door opens)

14:17.227 --> 14:19.029
(door slams)

14:32.172 --> 14:33.873
(man) RIGHT OVER HERE.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.546
(Bree) OKAY, SO YOU HAVE ANOTHER
ONE OF THOSE IN THE TRUCK?

14:36.546 --> 14:39.549
THANK YOU.
 (woman) I'LL BE BACK
IN TEN MINUTES!

14:39.549 --> 14:42.913
WE NEED FOUR SETTINGS
ON FIVE, PLEASE.
 LYNETTE, I WISH I HAD TIME
TO BE MORE TACTFUL, BUT I DON'T.

14:42.913 --> 14:45.986
YOUR SWAN IS PATHETIC, AND I'M
FIRING YOU FROM NAPKIN DUTY.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.988
NO, NO, GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.
I WILL GET IT.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.990
(cell phone rings)
 YES?

14:49.990 --> 14:52.392
OH, THERE YOU ARE!
WHERE IS MY ICE SCULPTURE?

14:52.392 --> 14:56.967
NO! NO, 6:00 IS TOO LATE.
I NEED IT NOW.

14:56.967 --> 15:00.170
OH, FORGET IT.
I'LL PICK IT UP MYSELF.

15:00.170 --> 15:02.172
WHY DON'T YOU
FILL WATER GLASSES?

15:02.172 --> 15:04.574
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT JOB, TOO.

15:09.980 --> 15:12.282
ANDREW... (sighs)
LOOK, I'M ON MY WAY BACK,

15:12.282 --> 15:15.345
BUT IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOU...
 (cell phone battery chirping)

15:15.345 --> 15:16.916
ANDREW?
 (beep)

15:16.916 --> 15:18.388
OH, DEAR GOD.

15:18.388 --> 15:21.021
OH, NO. DON'T DIE ON ME NOW!

15:21.021 --> 15:22.652
(loud pop, tires screeching)

15:22.652 --> 15:25.195
AAH!

15:25.195 --> 15:28.098
(whispers) OH, DEAR GOD.

15:28.098 --> 15:31.401
(panting)

15:39.039 --> 15:41.111
(clatter)

15:57.527 --> 16:01.992
(horn blaring)

16:01.992 --> 16:04.294
AAH! HELP ME!

16:04.294 --> 16:06.296
HELP!

16:10.000 --> 16:13.003
I'M JUST SAYING WE SHOULD
PAY OFF ALL OF OUR BILLS

16:13.003 --> 16:16.006
AND PUT THE REST IN SAVINGS.
 SAVINGS?
NOBODY DOES THAT ANYMORE.

16:16.006 --> 16:19.109
WELL, I MEAN, YOU NEVER KNOW.
WE MIGHT HAVE KIDS.

16:19.109 --> 16:21.111
OH, CARLOS,
WE'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE KIDS.

16:21.111 --> 16:24.184
SHOES ARE MY KIDS. LET ME BE
THE MOTHER I WAS MEANT TO BE.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.515
(cell phone rings)

16:25.515 --> 16:27.357
(beep)
 HELLO?

16:27.357 --> 16:29.519
WHERE'S MY BEAR?

16:31.161 --> 16:33.363
OH. RIGHT. THE BEAR.

16:33.363 --> 16:38.698
WELL... I LOOKED ALL OVER
AND JUST COULDN'T FIND IT.

16:38.698 --> 16:42.272
I GUESS THE COPS TOOK IT.
I'M REALLY SORRY, ELLIE.

16:42.272 --> 16:44.504
I KNOW IT WAS
A GIFT FROM YOUR DAD.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.637
IT JUST BREAKS MY HEART.
 YOU FOUND THE MONEY,
DIDN'T YOU?

16:47.637 --> 16:50.040
(raises pitch)
MONEY? WHAT MONEY?

16:50.040 --> 16:52.182
YOU'RE LYING.
I CAN HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE.

16:52.182 --> 16:54.214
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY VOICE?

16:54.214 --> 16:57.487
OKAY, LISTEN, BITCH.
YOU DO NOT WANNA SCREW WITH ME.

16:57.487 --> 17:00.450
(normal voice)
HOW ABOUT WE SPLIT IT 50-50?

17:02.592 --> 17:04.594
I'M COMING TO GET MY MONEY,

17:04.594 --> 17:08.698
AND IF ONE DIME IS MISSING,
I WILL THROW ACID IN YOUR FACE.
 (beep)

17:12.061 --> 17:15.805
OKAY, WE REALLY NEED
TO GET CALLER I.D.

17:18.068 --> 17:21.540
(panting)

17:21.540 --> 17:23.213
(sighs)

17:29.649 --> 17:31.481
UGH.

17:34.184 --> 17:35.655
(groans)

17:35.655 --> 17:38.428
WHAT MORE CAN YOU DO TO ME?

17:44.063 --> 17:46.666
NEED A LIFT?

17:51.171 --> 17:52.502
HEY.

17:52.502 --> 17:55.475
HI. IS, UH, DYLAN HERE
BY ANY CHANCE?

17:55.475 --> 17:57.677
UH, UM, NO,
I-I HAVEN'T SEEN HER.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.179
OKAY. THANKS.

17:59.179 --> 18:01.251
HEY, KATHERINE,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:01.251 --> 18:03.783
UH... DYLAN AND I, WE...

18:03.783 --> 18:06.416
HAD A BIG FIGHT. (chuckles)

18:06.416 --> 18:08.418
WELL,
I'M SURE SHE'S JUST UPSET,

18:08.418 --> 18:11.221
AND SHE'LL COME HOME
AFTER SHE COOLS OFF.

18:11.221 --> 18:12.692
NOT THIS TIME.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.195
I LIED TO HER.
(chuckles nervously)

18:15.195 --> 18:19.369
WELL... WE ALL LIE
TO OUR KIDS SOMETIMES, RIGHT?

18:19.369 --> 18:21.401
I'VE BEEN DOING IT
HER WHOLE LIFE--

18:21.401 --> 18:23.403
ONE LIE ON TOP OF ANOTHER--

18:23.403 --> 18:26.105
AND THE THING... (chuckles)
I LEARNED TOO LATE

18:26.105 --> 18:29.108
IS THAT EVENTUALLY THEY ALL
COME CRASHING DOWN ON YOU.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.111
(voice breaks) ANYWAY,
IF YOU SEE HER, LET ME KNOW?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.284
THANKS.

18:34.284 --> 18:37.187
(sighs)

18:40.390 --> 18:43.393
(door shuts)
 (Wayne)
WHAT'S YOUR HURRY, KATHY?

18:49.359 --> 18:51.431
(lock clanks)

18:51.431 --> 18:52.732
(chuckles)

18:59.509 --> 19:01.441
AAH! AAH!

19:01.441 --> 19:04.244
(bang)
 AAH.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.646
WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY DAUGHTER?

19:06.646 --> 19:10.320
(panting) I'M NOT
TELLING YOU ANYTHING,

19:10.320 --> 19:12.882
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
KILL ME.

19:12.882 --> 19:14.884
I DON'T CARE.

19:14.884 --> 19:17.587
I BELIEVE YOU.

19:17.587 --> 19:19.689
I DO.

19:19.689 --> 19:22.892
BUT WHAT ABOUT DYLAN?

19:22.892 --> 19:28.198
OR SHOULD I SAY, THAT GIRL
THAT LIVES HERE WITH YOU?

19:28.198 --> 19:30.500
I BET YOU'D CARE
IF I KILLEDHER.

19:42.212 --> 19:43.553
UH...

19:43.553 --> 19:45.385
THERE ARE NO WINGS.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.388
YES, AND THE "VENUS de MILO"
IS MISSING TWO ARMS.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.560
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

19:50.560 --> 19:52.322
IT'S... STUNNING.

19:52.322 --> 19:55.865
(indistinct conversations,
laughter in distance)

19:59.229 --> 20:01.731
(sighs deeply)

20:01.731 --> 20:03.703
(chuckles)

20:03.703 --> 20:06.205
WELL, I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD SAY THANK YOU.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.739
OH, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
YOU'RE JUST LUCKY I WAS THERE.

20:09.739 --> 20:12.842
WAS I LUCKY,
OR WERE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

20:15.285 --> 20:18.288
I THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT NEED MY HELP.

20:18.288 --> 20:19.489
(chuckles)

20:19.489 --> 20:21.821
AND YOU WERE RIGHT. I DID.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.294
YOU JUST THINK
I'M BEING STUBBORN, DON'T YOU?

20:24.294 --> 20:26.296
MAKING YOU
JUMP THROUGH HOOPS

20:26.296 --> 20:28.398
WHEN IT'S SO CLEAR
WE BELONG TOGETHER.

20:28.398 --> 20:30.400
I DON'T THINK ANYTHING,
BREE.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.902
I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE THERE FOR YOU

20:32.902 --> 20:35.234
AND HOPING EVENTUALLY
YOU'LL FORGIVE ME.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.236
BUT THAT'S JUST IT, ORSON.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.908
IF I FORGIVE YOU,

20:38.908 --> 20:41.311
THEN I'M FORGIVING
WHAT YOU DID TO MIKE.

20:41.311 --> 20:44.474
I CAN'T DO THAT. AND--
AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME TO.

20:44.474 --> 20:46.476
I MEAN,
BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF.

20:46.476 --> 20:48.478
IF I TOOK YOU BACK NOW,

20:48.478 --> 20:51.250
I WOULDN'T BE
THE WOMAN YOU LOVE.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.283
THEN WHAT CAN I DO?

20:53.283 --> 20:55.285
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU.

20:55.285 --> 20:58.658
TURN YOURSELF IN TO THE POLICE
AND LET JUSTICE RUN ITS COURSE.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.561
I CAN'T DO THAT, BREE.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.363
IWANTTO,

21:03.363 --> 21:07.667
FOR YOU,
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.440
BUT I DON'T THINK
I COULD SURVIVE IT.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.703
WELL...

21:13.703 --> 21:15.705
SO HERE WE ARE.

21:18.508 --> 21:20.009
(sighs)

21:24.314 --> 21:26.816
WHATISTHIS?
 IT'S YOUR ICE SCULPTURE.

21:26.816 --> 21:28.488
NO, IT'S NOT.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.990
I SEE NO TURRETS.
I SEE NO FLAGS.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.463
I SEE NO MOAT
FULL OF VODKA.

21:33.463 --> 21:36.996
WHAT I SEE IS
A GIANT, ICY SLAP IN THE FACE.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.599
BOB!

21:41.671 --> 21:44.534
WHAT'S THAT?

21:44.534 --> 21:47.537
I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO REACH YOU THIS SUMMER

21:47.537 --> 21:49.439
WHEN YOU'RE DOING
THAT INTERNSHIP.

21:49.439 --> 21:52.482
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?

21:54.083 --> 21:56.346
HERE'S THE THING.

21:56.346 --> 21:58.418
YOU AND I HAVE ALWAYS HAD

21:58.418 --> 22:00.420
KIND OF AN UNCONVENTIONAL
RELATIONSHIP,

22:00.420 --> 22:02.422
AND THE REASON THAT WORKED

22:02.422 --> 22:05.625
WAS BECAUSE WE ALWAYS
TELL EACH OTHER THE TRUTH...

22:05.625 --> 22:07.326
UNTIL YESTERDAY.

22:07.326 --> 22:11.761
JULIE, I LIED ABOUT NOT HAVING
ENOUGH MONEY TO SEND YOU.

22:11.761 --> 22:13.933
WHY?

22:13.933 --> 22:18.337
(sighs) BECAUSE I JUST
FREAKED OUT ABOUT YOU LEAVING.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.640
BUT YOU KNEW
I WAS GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE.

22:20.640 --> 22:23.012
YES, IN THEFALL.

22:23.012 --> 22:27.547
AND I NEEDED THOSE EXTRA
THREE MONTHS TO GET READY. I...

22:27.547 --> 22:31.581
I STILL HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT

22:31.581 --> 22:34.924
HOW I'M GONNA GET BY
WITHOUTYOU.

22:36.486 --> 22:37.687
MOM...

22:37.687 --> 22:40.890
(voice breaks) SERIOUSLY...

22:40.890 --> 22:45.034
I JUST LEAN ON YOU
IN WAYS YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

22:45.034 --> 22:47.036
I THINK YOU ARE STRONGER

22:47.036 --> 22:49.539
THAN YOU GIVE YOURSELF
CREDIT FOR.

22:49.539 --> 22:52.402
WELL... I SPEND MORE TIME
WITH ME THAN YOU DO,

22:52.402 --> 22:54.404
AND I'M A MESS. (laughs)

22:54.404 --> 22:56.906
(laughs) WELL,
YOUWEREWHEN DAD LEFT.

22:56.906 --> 22:58.978
I HAD MY HANDS FULL THEN.

22:58.978 --> 23:02.081
BUT YOU'VE GROWN SO MUCH
THESE LAST FIVE YEARS.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.653
REALLY?

23:03.653 --> 23:07.917
YOU ARE A SECURE,
CONFIDENT WOMAN NOW.

23:07.917 --> 23:10.420
YOU'RE READY
TO SPREAD YOUR WINGS AND FLY.

23:10.420 --> 23:12.762
FRANKLY,
MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

23:12.762 --> 23:15.565
(whispers) THANKS.

23:15.565 --> 23:17.597
(normal voice)
NOW I WANT YOU

23:17.597 --> 23:20.029
TO HAVE THAT PHONE ON YOU
AT ALL TIMES...

23:20.029 --> 23:22.972
BECAUSE I'M STILL NOT SURE
HOW TO WORK THE DISHWASHER.

23:22.972 --> 23:25.004
(both laugh)

23:27.477 --> 23:29.479
(woman) CAN YOU HELP ME?

23:29.479 --> 23:32.442
FOR GOD SAKE, LEE!
IT'S JUST AN ICE SCULPTURE!

23:32.442 --> 23:34.644
IT ISNOT
 "JUST AN ICE SCULPTURE"!

23:34.644 --> 23:37.647
IT'S THE SCULPTURE AND MAKING ME
MOVE TO THE SUBURBS

23:37.647 --> 23:40.019
AND FORCING ME TO BE NICE
TO YOUR HOMOPHOBIC BOSS.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.021
YOU KNOW WHAT? TOM'S RIGHT.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.794
IF I DON'T START STANDING UP
FOR MYSELF, I'MDOOMED.

23:44.794 --> 23:48.498
I DON'T BELIEVE
I USED THE WORD "DOOMED."

23:48.498 --> 23:52.101
YOU'RE ALWAYS OVERRULING ME.
YOU TREAT ME LIKE A CHILD.

23:52.101 --> 23:54.864
WELL, I'VE HAD IT!
CEREMONY'S OFF,MEINFUHRER!

23:54.864 --> 23:57.967
IT'S A CHUNK OF ICE,
YOU DRAMA QUEEN!

23:59.769 --> 24:02.572
OKAY... ALL I SAID WAS--

24:02.572 --> 24:05.444
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAID.
WE HAVE TO FIX THIS!

24:05.444 --> 24:08.618
OR DO YOU WANT TO TELL BREE
THAT YOU TORPEDOED HER CEREMONY?

24:08.618 --> 24:10.620
I DID NOT TELL YOU TO PUT MUMS
IN THAT ARRANGEMENT!

24:10.620 --> 24:13.452
ANDDON'TPOINT YOUR FINGER
AT ME OR I'LL SNAP IT RIGHT OFF.

24:13.452 --> 24:15.454
I'LL FIND BOB.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.026
I'LL GET LEE.
 YEAH.

24:17.026 --> 24:19.559
(Lee) YOU CAN'T
MAKE ME TALK TO HIM.

24:19.559 --> 24:22.562
YEAH, I CAN. SIT DOWN.
EARLIER, MY HUSBAND,

24:22.562 --> 24:24.864
IN AN ATTEMPT TO HELP YOU
WITH YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

24:24.864 --> 24:27.537
MISTAKENLY GAVE YOU
SOME ADVICE,

24:27.537 --> 24:29.839
WHICH HE WOULD NOW
LIKE TO TAKE BACK. TOM?

24:29.839 --> 24:32.542
ACTUALLY, I STAND BY
EVERYTHING I SAID.

24:32.542 --> 24:35.505
MY MISTAKE WAS IN
NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH.
 WHAT?

24:35.505 --> 24:38.107
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO BREAK UP
OVER AN ICE SCULPTURE,

24:38.107 --> 24:40.109
YOU GUYS SHOULD
ABSOLUTELY NOT GET MARRIED.

24:40.109 --> 24:42.552
(under breath) WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?

24:42.552 --> 24:44.584
BECAUSE WHO GETS TO CHOOSE
THE ICE SCULPTURE,

24:44.584 --> 24:46.716
WHO SHOULD TAKE OUT
THE TRASH,

24:46.716 --> 24:49.218
WHO HAS TO STAY HOME
AND MAKE THE MINI PIZZAS--

24:49.218 --> 24:51.220
THAT'S THE LITTLE STUFF.

24:51.220 --> 24:54.864
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN THE BIG STUFF COMES ALONG?
 COULD YOU GIVE US A SECOND?

24:54.864 --> 24:58.928
NO. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN A TORNADO HITS YOUR HOUSE,

24:58.928 --> 25:01.601
OR YOU HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR KIDS,

25:01.601 --> 25:03.603
OR ONE OF YOU GETS CANCER?

25:03.603 --> 25:06.736
AT SOME POINT, THE CRAP
IS GOING TO HIT THE FAN,

25:06.736 --> 25:09.739
AND THAT IS WHY NOW,
 BEFOREYOU MAKE THE COMMITMENT,

25:09.739 --> 25:12.081
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF,

25:12.081 --> 25:16.946
IS THAT PERSON IN BED
NEXT TO YOU WORTH THE TROUBLE?

25:18.848 --> 25:22.121
DO YOU LOVE HIM... OR HER
SO MUCH

25:22.121 --> 25:26.195
THAT NO DISEASE,
NO DISASTER

25:26.195 --> 25:28.798
COULD POSSIBLY
PULL YOU APART?

25:32.702 --> 25:35.705
ANSWER HIM.

25:35.705 --> 25:37.637
SURE.
 OF COURSE I DO.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.208
GOOD.

25:39.208 --> 25:41.010
GOOD, THEN...

25:41.010 --> 25:42.271
(sniffles)

25:42.271 --> 25:44.714
GET OUT THERE AND GET COMMITTED,
YOU CRAZY KIDS.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.553
(door opens)

26:04.694 --> 26:06.265
(man) OH, MY GOD.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.598
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU NEED SOME HELP?

26:08.598 --> 26:10.700
YES.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.702
(grunts)

26:12.702 --> 26:15.274
THANKS FOR STOPPING.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.646
(tires screech)

26:23.613 --> 26:25.915
YES, OFFICER. I SEE YOU.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

26:25.915 --> 26:27.917
NOW REMEMBER,
ELLIE'S DANGEROUS.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.920
SO IF SHE SHOWS UP, FEEL FREE
TO USE EXCESSIVE FORCE.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.121
(beep)

26:32.121 --> 26:34.964
(Gabrielle) CARLOS,
ARE YOU ALMOST READY?

26:36.896 --> 26:38.828
CARLOS?

26:38.828 --> 26:40.830
DID YOU HEAR ME?

26:43.332 --> 26:45.705
I'M JUST GETTING MY JACKET.

26:54.243 --> 26:56.816
OH, HONEY, CAN YOU CARRY
THE HOUSE KEYS?

26:56.816 --> 26:58.818
THEY DON'T FIT IN MY PURSE.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.990
(lowered voice)
ELLIE'S UPSTAIRS.

27:00.990 --> 27:03.993
WHAT?!
 SHE'S IN OUR BEDROOM.
I HEARD HER BREATHING.

27:03.993 --> 27:06.996
CALL THE COPS.
 WAIT! SHE'S GONNA
STEAL OUR MONEY!

27:06.996 --> 27:08.998
YOU CAN'T GO UP THERE.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

27:08.998 --> 27:12.902
(whispers) WELL,
NOT AS DANGEROUS AS POVERTY!
 (grunts) GABY.

27:38.027 --> 27:40.760
(both grunting)

27:44.794 --> 27:46.365
GABY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:46.365 --> 27:48.297
(Gabrielle screams)

27:48.297 --> 27:52.041
(all grunting)

27:52.041 --> 27:53.973
AAH! CARLOS!

27:53.973 --> 27:56.806
CARLOS, DON'T JUST STAND THERE!
GO GET HELP!

27:56.806 --> 27:59.208
HELP! POLICE!

27:59.208 --> 28:00.950
THAT'S THE CLOSET!

28:00.950 --> 28:02.882
(Roxy barks)

28:02.882 --> 28:05.284
(Roxy snarls)
 OW!

28:05.284 --> 28:09.118
POLICE! POLICE!

28:09.118 --> 28:10.990
GET IN HERE NOW!

28:15.965 --> 28:18.968
(indistinct conversations)

28:32.882 --> 28:34.013
WAYNE.

28:35.484 --> 28:38.447
I DON'T THINK
YOU'VE THOUGHT THIS THROUGH.

28:38.447 --> 28:39.949
SHUT UP.

28:39.949 --> 28:42.391
IF I TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED,

28:42.391 --> 28:44.323
IF I DON'T TELL YOU...

28:44.323 --> 28:46.255
YOU'RE GONNA KILL ME ANYWAY.

28:46.255 --> 28:48.357
WHO YOU GONNA PIN IT ON?

28:52.762 --> 28:55.464
WE HAVE HISTORY.

28:55.464 --> 28:58.838
RIGHT NOW I'M JUST
YOUR BITTER, CRAZY EX.

28:58.838 --> 29:02.141
BUT IF I TURN UP DEAD,
AND YOU HAVE NO ALIBI--

29:02.141 --> 29:04.373
YOU LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT.

29:04.373 --> 29:06.045
(door opens)

29:08.047 --> 29:09.979
(door shuts)

29:11.150 --> 29:12.782
(knife unsheathes)

29:12.782 --> 29:15.925
LOOK, I'M HAVING
A LITTLE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

29:15.925 --> 29:18.788
I JUST NEED
TO HIDE HERE FOR A SEC.

29:18.788 --> 29:21.430
AND I DON'T WANNA HURT YOU,
SO DON'T MAKE ME.

29:21.430 --> 29:23.092
ALL RIGHT?

29:24.934 --> 29:26.896
GOOD.

29:26.896 --> 29:29.799
I'M GLAD WE UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER.

29:34.944 --> 29:36.976
(gasps)

29:41.010 --> 29:42.982
HUH.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.984
AND WITHYOURGUN, TOO.

29:46.816 --> 29:50.890
I GUESS
I JUST FOUND MY ALIBI.

29:53.863 --> 29:56.896
(woman) AND NOW WE WILL DO
THE EXCHANGING OF THE RINGS...

29:56.896 --> 29:58.427
SNAPPY CEREMONY, BREE.

29:58.427 --> 30:00.930
YOU AND KATHERINE
REALLY DID A BANG-UP JOB.

30:00.930 --> 30:02.932
NO,IDID A BANG-UP JOB.

30:02.932 --> 30:04.934
KATHERINE BAILED ON ME
AND LEFT TOWN LAST NIGHT.

30:04.934 --> 30:08.037
I THINK YOU GOT HOSED.
I JUST SAW HER AN HOUR AGO.

30:08.037 --> 30:10.379
...HERE AT THIS
JOYOUS AND FESTIVE OCCASION.

30:10.379 --> 30:12.241
PLEASE JOIN HANDS.

30:12.241 --> 30:15.915
SHE WAS ON THE RUN,
SHE BROKE IN,

30:15.915 --> 30:19.949
SHE STABBED YOU,
YOU SHOT HER. CASE CLOSED.

30:19.949 --> 30:22.952
IT'S LIKE THE ALIBI FAIRY
LEFT ME A PRESENT.

30:22.952 --> 30:27.226
BUT I DO WONDER...

30:27.226 --> 30:29.929
WHAT IF DYLAN DOESN'T COME BACK?

30:31.931 --> 30:33.502
WE HAD A FIGHT.

30:35.905 --> 30:39.068
SHE SAID SHE HATED ME,
SAID SHE WAS LEAVING...

30:39.068 --> 30:40.509
FOR GOOD.

30:40.509 --> 30:42.872
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO, KATHY?

30:42.872 --> 30:46.615
I KNOW IT SOUNDS CONVENIENT.
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF IT'S TRUE?

30:46.615 --> 30:50.950
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
ANOTHER PLAN.

30:50.950 --> 30:54.383
SHE WAS THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD
MAKE ME TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.231
(rapping at door)

31:02.231 --> 31:05.995
KATHERINE? IT'S BREE.
WE NEED TO TALKNOW!

31:07.396 --> 31:10.869
(rapping at door resumes)

31:10.869 --> 31:13.172
THAT GIRL THAT WAS
LIVING WITH THE SOLISES?

31:13.172 --> 31:16.875
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT I SAW HER
HEADING DOWN THAT WAY.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.547
HOPE YOU FIND HER.

31:18.547 --> 31:20.209
I'D HATE TO THINK

31:20.209 --> 31:23.312
THERE WAS SOME MANIAC
RUNNING AROUND OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

31:33.062 --> 31:35.064
(whispers)
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.

31:35.064 --> 31:36.365
SHUT IT!

31:36.365 --> 31:38.497
SO LET ME CATCH YOU UP.

31:38.497 --> 31:41.500
I NEED TO KNOW SOMETHING THAT
ONLY MY EX-WIFE CAN TELL ME,

31:41.500 --> 31:44.673
BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO.
SHE NEEDS A LITTLE INCENTIVE.

31:44.673 --> 31:48.237
SO THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.
 WAYNE... PLEASE DON'T.

31:48.237 --> 31:51.340
YEAH? HOW IS IT GONNA FEEL
KNOWING...

31:51.340 --> 31:54.583
THAT YOU COULD'VE
STOPPED THIS?

31:56.485 --> 31:59.118
(gasps)

31:59.118 --> 32:01.320
ALL RIGHT!

32:03.322 --> 32:05.194
I'LL TELL YOU.

32:07.496 --> 32:09.498
(gun hammer clicks)

32:12.962 --> 32:16.635
AFTER I LEFT YOU...

32:16.635 --> 32:19.608
A FEW MONTHS PASSED,

32:19.608 --> 32:23.312
AND I CONVINCED MYSELF

32:23.312 --> 32:26.045
THAT YOU'D FORGOTTEN
ABOUT US.

32:26.045 --> 32:27.977
BUT I WAS WRONG.

32:31.620 --> 32:34.423
HOW WAS DYLAN?
DID SHE BEHAVE HERSELF?

32:34.423 --> 32:36.425
SHE'S AN ANGEL.

32:36.425 --> 32:39.458
I... JUST HOPE
I DIDN'T DO SOMETHING WRONG.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.461
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
 WELL, YOUR EX-HUSBAND
WAS HERE EARLIER,

32:42.461 --> 32:45.294
AND, OF COURSE,
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS HIM

32:45.294 --> 32:47.536
UNTIL DYLAN
CALLED HIM "DADDY."

32:47.536 --> 32:49.538
I-I'M SORRY,
I SHOULD'VE CALLED YOU,

32:49.538 --> 32:52.201
BUT DYLAN WAS
JUST SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM.

32:52.201 --> 32:54.403
HE BROUGHT HER
A BICYCLE AND A DOLL.

32:54.403 --> 32:57.306
AND SHE WON'T LET THAT DOLL
OUT OF HER SIGHT.

32:57.306 --> 33:00.049
KATHERINE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:00.049 --> 33:02.411
(Katherine)
I WAS GOING TO RUN AGAIN,

33:02.411 --> 33:04.553
BUT YOU DIDN'T
GIVE ME ENOUGH TIME.

33:06.215 --> 33:08.317
WAYNE JUST DROVE UP.

33:08.317 --> 33:11.120
SHOULD WE CALL THE POLICE?

33:11.120 --> 33:12.561
NO.

33:12.561 --> 33:14.363
LET HIM IN.

33:17.466 --> 33:20.169
I KNEW IT WAS TIME TO FACE YOU

33:20.169 --> 33:23.702
AND LET YOU KNOW YOU WERE NOT
WELCOME IN MY HOME,

33:23.702 --> 33:25.704
AND NEITHER WERE YOUR GIFTS.

33:37.246 --> 33:40.549
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY
I SPENT LOOKING FOR YOU?
 WELL, I'M SURE

33:40.549 --> 33:43.522
YOU STILL HAD ENOUGH
TO BUY LIQUOR BY THE CASELOAD.

33:43.522 --> 33:46.395
WOW! LOOK WHO'S GOTTEN SASSY
WHILE SHE'S BEEN AWAY.

33:46.395 --> 33:48.557
WOW, I THINK I LIKE IT.
 WHAT DO YOU WANT, WAYNE?

33:48.557 --> 33:51.560
I WANT MY DAUGHTER BACK.
 WHY? YOU GETTING LAZY
IN YOUR OLD AGE?

33:51.560 --> 33:54.303
YOU NEED SOMEBODY SMALLER
TO POUND ON?

33:54.303 --> 33:56.565
I NEVER TOUCHED
A HAIR ON HER HEAD!

33:56.565 --> 33:59.268
YEAH, BUT NOW SHE'S GOTTEN
OLDER ANDSASSIER,

33:59.268 --> 34:03.112
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND
ALL SORTS OF REASONS TO HIT HER.
 I DON'T HAVE TO ASK,
YOU KNOW.

34:03.112 --> 34:05.344
I COULD JUST GO UP THERE
IF I WANT.
 SHE IS ASLEEP!
GET THE HELL OUT!

34:05.344 --> 34:08.617
I'M HER FATHER!
 I SAID NO!

34:10.379 --> 34:13.051
(grunts)
 (glass shatters)

34:13.051 --> 34:14.753
UHH. AAH.

34:14.753 --> 34:16.425
(sighs)

34:16.425 --> 34:18.427
(panting)

34:18.427 --> 34:20.659
(panting) I'M BLEEDING.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.491
PROFUSELY.

34:22.491 --> 34:24.493
YOU SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR.

34:26.435 --> 34:29.438
(grunting)

34:31.469 --> 34:33.502
I'LL BE BACK
FOR MY DAUGHTER.

34:33.502 --> 34:35.504
YOU JUST UNDERSTAND THIS--

34:35.504 --> 34:38.206
THERE ISNOTHING
 THAT I WILL NOT DO

34:38.206 --> 34:41.449
TO KEEP YOU AWAY FROM HER.
 NOTHING.

34:45.514 --> 34:47.255
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:47.255 --> 34:48.516
OH!

34:48.516 --> 34:51.520
I HEARD A CRASH.
 YEAH, I-I HIT HIM
WITH THE CANDLESTICK,

34:51.520 --> 34:53.522
AND... HE WENT DOWN
PRETTY HARD.

34:53.522 --> 34:55.594
THANK GOD.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.667
YOU KNOW, I THINK NOW WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME TO BREAK OUT

34:58.667 --> 35:01.500
THE 10-YEAR-OLD SCOTCH
I'VE BEEN SAVING.

35:04.373 --> 35:06.835
I HONESTLY THOUGHT
IT WAS FINALLY OVER.

35:06.835 --> 35:10.339
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I COULD'VE BEEN SO WRONG.

35:12.511 --> 35:15.514
(Lily screams)

35:15.514 --> 35:17.446
KATHERINE!

35:19.488 --> 35:23.552
(sobbing) I CAME IN
TO GIVE HER ANOTHER BLANKET.

35:23.552 --> 35:26.725
HER HAND IS ICE-COLD!

35:26.725 --> 35:30.499
(screams)

35:30.499 --> 35:35.504
AUNT LILY TOLD ME
I COULDN'T GO TO THE POLICE.

35:35.504 --> 35:37.506
SHE'D SAID YOU'D MAKE IT SEEM

35:37.506 --> 35:40.809
LIKE I KILLED DYLAN
TO KEEP YOU FROM TAKING HER,

35:40.809 --> 35:44.373
SO I LET HER BURY MY BABY
IN THE WOODS.

35:44.373 --> 35:46.675
I KNEW
I'D HAVE TO RUN AWAY AGAIN,

35:46.675 --> 35:49.678
BUT I ALSO KNEW YOU'D NEVER
STOP LOOKING FOR ME,

35:49.678 --> 35:52.481
SO I CAME UP WITH A PLAN.
 (girl crying)

35:52.481 --> 35:54.483
I FOUND A GIRL
IN A ROMANIAN ORPHANAGE

35:54.483 --> 35:56.555
WHO LOOKED JUST LIKE DYLAN.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.487
THE RESEMBLANCE WAS UNCANNY.

35:58.487 --> 36:00.489
HER MOTHER
HAD DIED IN CHILDBIRTH,

36:00.489 --> 36:02.491
AND HER FATHER
HAD BEEN MURDERED.

36:02.491 --> 36:05.394
AS I LOOKED
INTO THOSE BIG, BLUE EYES,

36:05.394 --> 36:06.735
I KNEW RIGHT THEN...

36:06.735 --> 36:09.938
(voice breaks) SHE NEEDED ME
AS MUCH AS I NEEDED HER.

36:20.209 --> 36:22.481
(whispers)
I'VE NEVER TOLD THAT TO ANYONE.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.483
(normal voice)
I EVEN LIED TO ADAM

36:24.483 --> 36:27.616
AND SAID IT WAS YOUR FAULT.

36:27.616 --> 36:30.619
(voice breaks) AND THAT'S HOW
I'VE SPENT THE LAST 12 YEARS...

36:30.619 --> 36:34.423
JUST TELLING ONE LIE
AFTER ANOTHER.

36:36.665 --> 36:39.328
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.
I'M SORRY, SIR.

36:39.328 --> 36:41.630
WE'RE HAVING A PARTY.
YOU CAN'T PARK HERE.

36:41.630 --> 36:44.603
SO YOU LET HER DIE.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.637
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

36:48.637 --> 36:51.740
I NEED YOU TO PARK
AROUND THE CORNER, OKAY?

36:51.740 --> 36:53.642
THANK YOU!

36:53.642 --> 36:55.344
(tires screech)

36:55.344 --> 36:58.617
(crowd screaming)

37:01.790 --> 37:04.793
YOU LET MY DAUGHTER DIE...

37:04.793 --> 37:06.655
LIKE A DOG.

37:06.655 --> 37:08.857
(whispers)
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

37:08.857 --> 37:12.631
THEN YOU BURIED HER LIKE ONE.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.633
BECAUSE I HAD TO.

37:14.633 --> 37:17.306
I KNEW IF YOU FOUND OUT, Y--

37:17.306 --> 37:19.308
THAT I WOULD KILL YOU.

37:19.308 --> 37:20.569
(car approaches)

37:20.569 --> 37:22.511
(tires screech)

37:22.511 --> 37:24.673
(engine turns off)

37:24.673 --> 37:26.244
(car door shuts)

37:27.776 --> 37:30.679
(front door opens and shuts)

37:30.679 --> 37:32.781
(Adam) KATHERINE!
WHERE ARE YOU?!

37:32.781 --> 37:34.653
ADAM!

37:34.653 --> 37:37.486
GET OUT! HE'S GOT A GUN!
 (rapid footsteps)

37:37.486 --> 37:40.989
(crashing, punches landing,
Adam and Wayne grunting)

37:40.989 --> 37:42.991
(crashing stops)

37:45.594 --> 37:49.568
(footsteps approaching)

38:01.580 --> 38:03.382
(sighs deeply)

38:03.382 --> 38:06.385
(groans) YOU JUST WATCH
HIM FOR A SEC, OKAY?

38:06.385 --> 38:08.387
I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS.

38:08.387 --> 38:11.690
FIRST WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
TO STOP THAT BLEEDING.
 OKAY.

38:19.968 --> 38:23.672
GO AHEAD.
YOU CALL THE COPS.

38:23.672 --> 38:26.735
ASK FOR MY BUDDY ROMSLO...

38:26.735 --> 38:29.338
(grunts)
OR CAPTAIN McMURPHY.

38:29.338 --> 38:32.881
(grunts)
WE PLAY SOFTBALL TOGETHER.

38:32.881 --> 38:36.715
THOSE GUYS'LL
TAKE CARE OF ME.

38:36.715 --> 38:40.549
AND EVEN IF
I DO A LITTLE TIME...

38:40.549 --> 38:42.921
(whispers) YOU KNOW
THIS ISN'T OVER.

38:42.921 --> 38:46.595
(normal voice) I'LL GET OUT
AND I'LL FIND YOU,

38:46.595 --> 38:49.398
AND I'LL MAKE YOU PAY.

38:49.398 --> 38:53.732
(whispers) I KNOW YOU WILL.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.434
(gunshot)

38:55.434 --> 38:57.406
(gasps)

39:15.684 --> 39:18.487
(crowd speaking indistinctly)

39:18.487 --> 39:22.491
OH, MY GOD!
BREE, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
 WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!

39:22.491 --> 39:25.494
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
BEFORE THE POLICE GET HERE.

39:25.494 --> 39:26.835
WE NEED TO TALK.

39:26.835 --> 39:28.697
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

39:28.697 --> 39:30.699
EXCUSE ME.

39:30.699 --> 39:32.701
SUSAN!
 COME HERE, COME HERE.

39:32.701 --> 39:35.143
WHAT'S GOING ON?
 OKAY, JUST LISTEN TO ME.

39:39.678 --> 39:41.980
MA'AM,
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO US.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.553
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

39:44.553 --> 39:46.855
MA'AM?

39:46.855 --> 39:50.689
THEN HE RAISED THE GUN
AND CAME TOWARD US.

39:50.689 --> 39:53.692
THANK GOD KATHERINE GRABBED
HIS ARM AND GOT THE GUN AWAY.

39:53.692 --> 39:56.725
THAT LUNATIC
WOULD'VE KILLED US ALL.

39:56.725 --> 39:59.027
I KNEW WAYNE WAS THE REASON
SHE MOVED AWAY,

39:59.027 --> 40:02.801
AND THE SECOND SHE MOVED BACK,
HE STARTED STALKING HER AGAIN.

40:02.801 --> 40:06.004
SHE WAS ALWAYS TELLING US
HOW TERRIFIED SHE WAS.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.707
WE ALWAYS KNEW HE'D DO SOMETHING
LIKE THIS EVENTUALLY,

40:08.707 --> 40:10.739
AND HE DID.
 (camera shutter clicking)

40:19.047 --> 40:20.749
LOOK...

40:20.749 --> 40:22.951
THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY
SELF-DEFENSE.

40:22.951 --> 40:26.424
TAKE THE CUFFS OFF,
GET HER TO THE HOSPITAL.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.457
(handcuffs unlock)

40:34.202 --> 40:37.866
(siren wailing)

40:44.072 --> 40:45.614
MOM?

40:45.614 --> 40:46.745
MOM!

40:46.745 --> 40:48.577
OH, MY!

40:48.577 --> 40:50.579
I'M SO SORRY, MOM.

40:50.579 --> 40:53.582
(sobbing)

41:05.734 --> 41:07.736
(Mary Alice)
THERE'S A RITUAL

41:07.736 --> 41:10.499
MY FRIENDS HAVE OBSERVED
FOR YEARS.

41:10.499 --> 41:13.502
ONCE A WEEK, THEY MEET
TO PLAY A GAME OF CARDS

41:13.502 --> 41:15.243
AND TALK ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

41:15.243 --> 41:17.746
OF COURSE, THERE'S ANOTHER
ASPECT TO THESE GATHERINGS

41:17.746 --> 41:21.750
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH GOSSIP OR POKER.

41:21.750 --> 41:24.753
EVERY SEVEN DAYS,
MY FRIENDS ARE REMINDED

41:24.753 --> 41:26.615
OF A BASIC HUMAN TRUTH--

41:26.615 --> 41:30.989
THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FRIENDSHIPS THAT ENDURE,

41:30.989 --> 41:35.924
ESPECIALLY IN A WORLD
THAT INSISTS ON CHANGING.

41:35.924 --> 41:38.797
OKAY, MY FRIENDS ARE GONE.

41:38.797 --> 41:42.170
I'M READY TO FIX YOU DINNER.

41:42.170 --> 41:44.202
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

41:44.202 --> 41:47.205
HEY, MOMMY,
WE'RE PLAYING FASHION MODEL!

41:47.205 --> 41:49.878
LOOK AT THIS MESS!

41:49.878 --> 41:53.211
YOU ARE LUCKY I GOT IN HERE
BEFORE YOU TOUCHED MY DRESSES!

41:53.211 --> 41:57.085
RUN, CELIA, RUN!

41:57.085 --> 42:00.719
MY VERA WANG?!

42:00.719 --> 42:02.851
I'M HOME!

42:02.851 --> 42:04.152
OH, THANK GOD.

42:04.152 --> 42:06.855
THE PUBLISHER SENT OVER
THE GALLEY FOR THE COOKBOOK.

42:06.855 --> 42:08.857
HE NEEDS YOU
TO PROOF THEM TONIGHT.

42:08.857 --> 42:11.099
I'VE ALSO GOT THE WOMAN
FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

42:11.099 --> 42:14.803
ON THE PHONE. SHE WANTS
TO DO THE INTERVIEW NOW.
 (Orson) IS THAT YOU, BREE?
THE WATER'S GETTING COLD.

42:14.803 --> 42:17.005
UH, LEAVE THE GALLEYS
IN MY OFFICE AND TELL

42:17.005 --> 42:20.008
THE WOMAN FROM "THE TIMES"
TO CALL ME BACK IN THE MORNING.

42:20.008 --> 42:23.011
I'M GONNA HAVE A NICE
BUBBLE BATH WITH MY HUSBAND.

42:23.011 --> 42:24.673
COMING, ORSON!

42:24.673 --> 42:27.876
WHY IS THERE A POLICE CAR
IN OUR DRIVEWAY?

42:27.876 --> 42:30.879
I WAS TELLING YOUR HUSBAND
WE JUST PICKED UP YOUR SON.

42:30.879 --> 42:33.852
HE BROKE INTO A CAR AT THE MALL
AND TOOK IT FOR A JOYRIDE.

42:33.852 --> 42:36.655
AGAIN?
I AM SO SORRY, OFFICER.

42:36.655 --> 42:39.688
WE HAVE TALKED TO PORTER
TILL WE'RE BLUE IN THE FACE.

42:39.688 --> 42:43.592
IT'S LIKE HE'S DETERMINED
TO GO BACK TO JUVENILE HALL.

42:43.592 --> 42:45.594
HONEY, IT WASN'T PORTER
THIS TIME.

42:45.594 --> 42:46.965
THEY ARRESTED PRESTON.

42:49.998 --> 42:53.001
(beep)
 (Dylan) It's me, Mom.
I'm back from Paris.

42:53.001 --> 42:56.004
It was just as gorgeous
as you said it would be,

42:56.004 --> 42:57.946
and you're not
gonna believe this.

42:57.946 --> 42:59.948
Bradley finally asked me
to marry him

42:59.948 --> 43:01.910
right there
under the Eiffel Tower.

43:01.910 --> 43:03.912
I'm so happy. Call me back.
 (beep)

43:08.857 --> 43:11.660
HONEY? I'M HOME.

43:13.862 --> 43:15.994
DID YOU MISS ME?

43:15.994 --> 43:18.026
YOU KNOW I DID.

43:18.026 --> 43:20.028
MMM.
