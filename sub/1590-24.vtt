Something really worthy of the
crystal empire's admiration?

12:45.766 --> 12:47.832
What are you talking about?

12:47.834 --> 12:50.368
You lit the torch
for the whole thing!

12:50.370 --> 12:53.138
Well, actually, that
wasn't really--

12:53.140 --> 12:55.540
That wasn't "worthy"
enough for you?

12:55.542 --> 13:00.979
Next thing you know, you'll be
asking to put on a rock concert!

13:00.981 --> 13:03.047
Agh! Celebrities.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.049
Wait. That's it!

13:06.218 --> 13:07.452
<i>(whoosh)</i>

13:10.556 --> 13:12.090
<i>(whoosh)</i>

13:12.092 --> 13:13.858
<i>(roar)</i>

13:13.860 --> 13:14.893
Second place!

13:14.895 --> 13:17.028
We got silver!

13:21.901 --> 13:24.903
Congratulations to
all our medalists.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.905
And now, the anthem of--

13:26.907 --> 13:29.274
And I shall do the
honor of singing!

13:29.276 --> 13:33.578
<i>(cheers)</i>

13:33.580 --> 13:35.547
Spike? What are
you doing?

13:35.549 --> 13:37.916
You know how they always
just play the music?

13:37.918 --> 13:39.918
Well, I know all the
words to our anthem

13:39.920 --> 13:42.821
And will sing them for you
now, loud and proud,

13:42.823 --> 13:44.322
<i>To the enjoyment of all!</i>

13:44.324 --> 13:47.091
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

13:49.395 --> 13:55.533
And now, um, the cloudsdale
anthem, as sung by spike.

13:56.435 --> 13:59.170
Wait, the cloudsdale anthem?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.606
They only play the anthem
for the winners, spike.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.942
The wonderbolts are
from cloudsdale!

14:03.944 --> 14:06.911
But I don't know the words
to the cloudsdale anthem.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.185
<i>Sing for us, o great</i>

14:14.187 --> 14:16.487

15:35.301 --> 15:37.201
Spike, you coming?

15:37.203 --> 15:40.204
Nah, I got this
stuff to pack up.

15:40.206 --> 15:43.408
But you've been moping in here
for almost the entire games.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.476
And tonight's the
closing ceremony.

15:45.478 --> 15:49.714
Which means we leave tomorrow.
Ergo the packing.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.294
And so the games conclude
as they always do

16:03.296 --> 16:06.531
With the ice archery finals.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.701
<i>Ice archers, take your places!</i>

16:09.703 --> 16:12.103
<i>(cheers)</i>

16:12.105 --> 16:15.006
Too bad ponyville doesn't have
any ice archers competing.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.607
We don't have
anyone to root for.

16:16.609 --> 16:20.445
Ponyville has 37 medals
and cloudsdale 36,

16:20.447 --> 16:23.181
So looks like we'll be medal
champs of the games anyway!

16:23.183 --> 16:26.551
But cloudsdale has two
ice archery finalists

16:26.553 --> 16:32.123
<i>If they both place, cloudsdale</i>
<i>wins the medal count.</i>

16:32.125 --> 16:34.726
So you're saying it all
comes down to this one event?

16:34.728 --> 16:38.429
<i>Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!</i>
<i>Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!</i>

16:40.265 --> 16:42.400
Twilight! Come take this
extra seat next to me

16:42.402 --> 16:44.235
And freak out over
the medal count.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.638
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

16:47.640 --> 16:49.307
Actually I was
looking for spike.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.441
Have you seen him?

16:50.443 --> 16:51.576
He wouldn't come.

16:51.578 --> 16:53.311
We tried to talk him into it.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.679
But he wouldn't listen.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.447
You can have his
extra seat, though.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.450
Uh...Twi?

17:07.559 --> 17:09.360
<i>Twilight: Spike? You here?</i>

17:09.362 --> 17:13.631
Uh, yeah. I'm super busy.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.533
Look at all this
packing left to do.

17:15.535 --> 17:19.470
No more hiding out.
You're coming with me.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.205
Now.

17:21.207 --> 17:25.743
Ok, fine. I'll come. Can
I at least wear these?

17:25.745 --> 17:31.115

17:31.117 --> 17:33.117

17:49.469 --> 17:51.335
Honestly spike, I don't
see why you're being

17:51.337 --> 17:53.204
So hard on yourself.

17:53.206 --> 17:56.140
I let everypony down. Twice!

17:56.142 --> 17:57.508
You never let anypony down

17:57.510 --> 17:59.377
So you have no idea
what that's like.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.813
Are you kidding? I've
totally let ponies down.

18:01.815 --> 18:06.517
The torch got lit; the aerial
relay teams got their medals.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.619
No harm no foul.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.721
Can we at least watch
from inside there?

18:10.723 --> 18:13.758
I'm not sure I'm ready to face
crowds in the stands just yet.

Steer it towards the field!

18:41.754 --> 18:43.421
Away from the crowds!

18:43.423 --> 18:45.656
Somepony cut the

19:17.222 --> 19:20.191
That was awesome!

19:22.327 --> 19:24.495
I just wanted to
thank you personally

19:24.497 --> 19:27.198
For saving those ponies,
and the games,

19:27.200 --> 19:30.401
O great and honorable spike
the brave and glorious.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.470
You must be very proud.

19:33.539 --> 19:34.539
I guess.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.307
All: You guess?

19:36.309 --> 19:38.743
I just saw what needed
to be done and reacted.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.745
It just so happens
I can breathe fire.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.447
If any of you could do that,
you'd have done the same.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.283
Forgive me for
being blunt, spike,

19:45.285 --> 19:47.518
But you're not makin'
a lick of sense.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.887
It's just how I feel.

19:49.889 --> 19:52.390
Wait a second. I
think I get it.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.425
You keep saying you
let everypony down.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.360
But we all keep
saying you didn't.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.964
You know who was disappointed
in you, spike? You.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.667
And only you can make
it right with you again.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.602
<i>What would that take, spike?</i>

20:04.604 --> 20:08.339
I don't know. Can
you turn back time?

20:08.341 --> 20:11.576
Cause I'd sure like a do-over
on that opening ceremony.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.611
We can't turn back time.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.614
But would you do me
the great honor

20:16.616 --> 20:18.583
<i>Of lighting fireworks</i>
<i>in my place</i>

20:18.585 --> 20:20.785

20:20.787 --> 20:24.655
You've saved the
crystal empire. Twice.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.757
I think you can
light some fireworks.

20:29.494 --> 20:31.963
I guess I have to at
least give it a shot.

<i>(happy chatter)</i>

20:36.001 --> 20:39.670

20:39.672 --> 20:42.707
Ponyville won the medal count!

20:42.709 --> 20:44.675
And only by one medal.

20:44.677 --> 20:48.346
Hmm. Wonder which
medal that was?

20:48.348 --> 20:50.014
Bam!

20:50.016 --> 20:52.583
How's it feel to have opened
the best equestria games

20:52.585 --> 20:54.552
In ponyville history, squirt?

20:54.554 --> 20:56.787
Probably as good as it
feels to close them.
