WEBVTT

00:43.711 --> 00:45.920
Listen, can you mail this for me today?

00:46.004 --> 00:47.922
Sure, Whitman.

00:48.006 --> 00:51.092
It's going to be at least 40 cents.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.724
Thank you .

01:28.630 --> 01:32.925
Mama, Mrs. Winter is a busybody.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.719
You're threatening me.

01:36.054 --> 01:37.764
I'm glad he wants to see me,

01:37.848 --> 01:41.476
but I-- I don't want to see him .

01:41.560 --> 01:44.729
I'm working a lot right now.
I don't have a lot of time.

01:46.273 --> 01:47.815
I have to go.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.195
Were you listening to my phone call?

01:52.279 --> 01:54.655
You mean your personal phone call?

01:56.366 --> 01:57.992
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.994
Peggy, will you get me
a glass of ice water?

02:00.078 --> 02:01.996
Someone hasn't told
the sun it's October.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.790
- M iss Holloway,
- Mr. Draper,

02:03.874 --> 02:05.208
it's the Clients' Luncheon .

02:05.292 --> 02:07.001
Mr. Cooper said
you were responsible

02:07.085 --> 02:08.711
while Mr. Sterling is out.

02:08.796 --> 02:11.380
Didn't you handle most of Mr. Sterling's
catering questions?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.757
Continue doing that.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.258
How is he? Have you visited?

02:14.343 --> 02:17.220
I have. He's less sickly.

02:17.304 --> 02:21.432
I hope he knows
how concerned we all are.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.560
- Good morning , chief.
- Don .

02:27.189 --> 02:28.940
Joan's been a bitch lately.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.233
Anyone else notice that?

02:30.317 --> 02:31.275
Oh , absolutely.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.069
- I like it.
- Oh , do you?

02:38.367 --> 02:40.910
This got kicked over
from Ed Baltz at Compton .

02:40.994 --> 02:44.705
We sent them Firestone last month
because of our conflict with Goodyear.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.499
This is how they repaid the favor.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.959
Look at that.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.044
I think it's a modified Lionel transformer.

02:50.128 --> 02:53.130
Well, I never thought I'd say this,
but what does the research say?

02:53.215 --> 02:55.466
Weight loss is a hard thing to prove.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.636
No, it isn't, It's "before"
and "after" pictures

02:58.720 --> 03:00.471
since the dawn of time.

03:00.556 --> 03:03.891
Mr, Martin Buckwald , its inventor,
he calls it the P.E . R. ,

03:03.976 --> 03:05.977
or Passive Exercise Regime.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.813
So it needs a name.

03:12.109 --> 03:14.318
The Electrocizer.

03:14.403 --> 03:17.071
For a slimmer, better you .

03:17.155 --> 03:18.781
That helps a little.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.157
Regarding slimmer,

03:20.242 --> 03:22.243
Buckwald has a fair amount of testimonials,

03:22.327 --> 03:25.204
but unfortunately
none you can take a picture of.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.164
We tried to get our own testimonials.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.208
Some of the fellas brought
it home to their wives.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.418
And?

03:30.502 --> 03:33.087
It's tricky. I , uh , gave it to Jennifer.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.547
She took it the wrong way.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.173
She told me to wear it.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.302
Violet has it.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.387
She says the scales are the same,

03:41.471 --> 03:45.099
but she hasn't given up on it
like she does with diets after a week.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.101
M itch and some of the other guys--

03:47.185 --> 03:48.603
We had eight belts.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.563
Again, there's been no weight loss yet.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.106
Who cares if it works?

03:52.190 --> 03:53.482
They're offering us
commission on media,

03:53.567 --> 03:56.319
plus a bounty on every unit
upside of last year's comps.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.195
But fake weight loss claims?

04:03.744 --> 04:04.744
Thank you .

04:11.960 --> 04:13.127
What about her?

04:13.211 --> 04:16.923
She's obviously losing
some kind of battle.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.592
You may have to let it out a little.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.510
Maybe you should
put her on your regimen

04:21.595 --> 04:24.138
of sprinting out the door
every day at 5 to 5.

04:24.222 --> 04:27.516
What I'm saying is she did
a heck of a job on Belle Jolie.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.560
Maybe lightning will strike twice.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.104
I don't think Peggy's the answer.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.650
I promised Buckwald
we'd go with our big guns.

04:35.734 --> 04:39.278
Our big guns have been silent.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.404
Peggy!

04:43.241 --> 04:44.951
Did you need more water?

04:46.286 --> 04:49.705
This device is a new product.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.667
I would like you
to give us your thoughts on it.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.502
Right now?

04:54.586 --> 04:55.586
No.

04:56.922 --> 04:59.799
It's a weight loss belt, it says.

04:59.883 --> 05:04.804
It, uh , stimulates the muscles,
imitating calisthenics.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.430
You'd be perfect for it.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.557
Why?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.810
Because you're a woman .

05:10.894 --> 05:13.270
And we'd like your point of view.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.857
I'm getting another account?

05:16.942 --> 05:20.194
It's an assignment, not an account.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.742
Go ahead, sweetheart,
Take it for a spin .

05:31.915 --> 05:33.791
Uh, am I allowed to change the name?

05:35.293 --> 05:36.585
Yes.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.212
Thank you .

05:39.256 --> 05:40.589
That'll be all.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.723
I need 3.59 for the phone bill .

05:48.807 --> 05:50.391
I told you I never use it.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.936
But you do use the saltines
and the Velveeta and the liverwurst.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.229
I never even got any.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.230
I had some people over

05:56.314 --> 05:58.649
while you were out drinking on Tuesday.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.235
3.59. That's your half of the phone.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.987
You should use it more.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.780
I have work to do.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.450
I don't know why you do that.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.326
When I leave the office, I'm done.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.435
Do you have to go home?

07:59.437 --> 08:01.188
No.

08:01.273 --> 08:04.400
Good . I don't want you to.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.028
I don't want to.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.453
This is hard for me.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.834
Mostly because I can't even imagine
how hard it must be for you .

08:24.462 --> 08:26.338
I don't think about it.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.175
I mean, I try not to.

08:29.259 --> 08:35.472
Must be a powerful mind you have there,
because I can't control mine.

08:38.310 --> 08:41.604
I keep thinking about us being together.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.022
We are together.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.899
I know, but--

08:48.612 --> 08:52.406
I don't know if I understand
how this works,

08:52.490 --> 08:54.241
where it goes.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.870
I'm worried it's a fantasy.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.498
It's not.

09:03.501 --> 09:08.255
I told you , I'm right
where I'm supposed to be.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.519
I just haven't figured out
what to do yet.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.454
I'm sorry, Would you
like me to wait outside?

09:40.538 --> 09:42.665
It's up to you .

09:42.749 --> 09:46.377
I , um , I did the work
on the weight loss belt,

09:46.461 --> 09:47.461
like you asked .

09:47.545 --> 09:48.587
That was fast.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.673
You asked me to.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.092
And what is your unique point of view?

09:53.176 --> 09:55.261
I wrote it down .

09:56.554 --> 09:58.472
Summarize.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.267
It's one day. I don't know
if I lost any weight.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.601
Do you feel different?

10:02.686 --> 10:05.854
I wrote it down .

10:13.571 --> 10:16.156
Peggy, you're saying
even less in here than you are now.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.702
It's hard to put into words.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.787
Then you have failed .

10:23.581 --> 10:26.208
You definitely feel something

10:26.293 --> 10:30.587
that I think some women . . .
would like to feel.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.924
Where is that here?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.679
It vibrates.

10:40.432 --> 10:44.143
And that coincides
with how you wear it.

10:48.523 --> 10:51.066
Oh . I see that here:

10:51.151 --> 10:52.526
"a sensation ."

10:52.610 --> 10:54.069
Yes.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.530
It explains its success.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.365
And it basically made me think

10:58.450 --> 11:01.994
it was probably. . ,
unrelated to weight loss.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.371
We now have a benefit.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.540
And we just have to figure out
how to put it into words.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.875
Have another go at it.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.668
I will work on that, M r. Draper.

11:11.296 --> 11:15.591
Peggy, just think about it deeply.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.468
Then forget it,

11:17.552 --> 11:21.805
and an idea will. . .jump up in your face.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.225
Thank you .

11:35.862 --> 11:37.029
Excuse me, ma'am .

11:37.113 --> 11:38.530
I hate to bother you .

11:38.615 --> 11:40.574
I'm from the Frederick
Air Conditioning Company,

11:40.658 --> 11:42.284
and I'd like to talk to you

11:42.369 --> 11:44.578
about an opportunity
to live in frozen comfort.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.330
I'm not interested .

11:46.414 --> 11:49.124
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.377
It's a scorcher out here.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.588
I--

11:54.672 --> 11:56.757
Of course.

11:56.841 --> 12:29.164
Thank you .

12:29.249 --> 12:34.503
You know, we have many units
in all price ranges.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.712
What?

12:36.965 --> 12:38.882
I'm married to a salesman .

12:38.967 --> 12:43.637
And I'm sure my husband and I
can brave another week

12:43.721 --> 12:46.390
or however long
this Indian summer's going to be.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.642
Can I come back when he is here?

12:48.726 --> 12:52.646
I mean , a unit here
or in your living room--

12:52.730 --> 12:54.565
We wouldn't
even have to alter your window.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.650
We could just cut a hole right above it.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.735
You see this gap?

12:58.820 --> 13:01.572
That's where your cool air,
whatever there is of it,

13:01.656 --> 13:02.739
is escaping .

13:02.824 --> 13:04.491
From that little space?

13:04.576 --> 13:08.245
Yes. And there's a science
to how heat patterns work.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.665
Now, what you need is
a unit here downstairs

13:11.749 --> 13:12.749
and one in your bedroom .

13:12.834 --> 13:16.128
That's if you have the right construction .

13:16.212 --> 13:18.672
That would be nice.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.300
I could take down some numbers,

13:21.384 --> 13:22.718
you know, measure everything .

13:22.802 --> 13:24.761
Write up an estimate--

13:24.846 --> 13:26.680
something you could
discuss with your husband

13:26.764 --> 13:28.682
when he comes home.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.018
I guess that would be okay.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.412
You know. . .

13:50.497 --> 13:53.081
my husband . . .

13:53.166 --> 13:55.792
I think he would rather go to Sears.

13:56.961 --> 13:58.754
If that's what you want.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.672
You should go.

14:00.798 --> 14:04.718
I can just guess what this would cost
and put it on your door for your husband .

14:04.802 --> 14:06.261
Please go.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.740
Fernando, we are pleased to hear
that case sales have more than doubled .

14:26.824 --> 14:29.785
We still believe that most of the credit
goes to your rum .

14:29.869 --> 14:31.828
Say hello from me.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.749
Bert Cooper says it is a unique pleasure
working with you .

14:35.833 --> 14:40.546
I just finished trying
to talk Lucky Strike off a ledge.

14:40.630 --> 14:41.797
Junior or Senior?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.757
Senior. He's coming for lunch tomorrow

14:43.841 --> 14:46.385
to see if Roger is still involved .

14:46.469 --> 14:48.762
And they're having this lunch
bedside, I suppose?

14:48.846 --> 14:51.974
I invited him here to see for himself.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.935
He called my bluff.

14:55.019 --> 14:57.521
Clear tomorrow.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.023
I need you to, uh ,

15:00.108 --> 15:02.734
draw focus from our guest of honor.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.574
. , .was number 2 in his class
at Columbia Law School .

15:08.658 --> 15:10.200
He works with Morgenthau ,

15:10.285 --> 15:13.787
and having been captivated by him
at more than one cocktail party,

15:13.871 --> 15:15.330
he is a charmer.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.249
I can see he does something for you ,

15:17.333 --> 15:19.751
but I don't know if this is the right time.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.795
Because you're getting
so much younger every day?

15:21.879 --> 15:24.423
Because I don't know
if my heart would be in it.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.176
Are you seeing that goy?

15:29.512 --> 15:30.721
A little bit.

15:30.805 --> 15:34.057
Well, I told you
I wouldn't let that stop me.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.268
What if he were, um . . .

15:36.352 --> 15:38.061
You're mumbling .

15:39.897 --> 15:41.898
What if he were married?

15:41.983 --> 15:44.651
My goodness.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.321
Jesus.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.531
Nothing's happened .

15:49.616 --> 15:50.907
Good .

15:52.619 --> 15:55.662
But I have been thinking about it.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.914
The two of us together.

16:00.418 --> 16:02.836
It feels so natural. I feel so close to him .

16:02.920 --> 16:04.796
Really?

16:04.881 --> 16:07.132
He's married , but I don't think he's happy.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.884
Obviously.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.221
What does it matter?
Nothing's going to happen .

16:13.306 --> 16:15.223
All I know is what I see in the movies.

16:15.308 --> 16:19.019
It's magical, and then they start talking
about him leaving his wife,

16:19.103 --> 16:20.687
and then he doesn't.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.856
I saw this one where the husband
gets the woman pregnant

16:22.940 --> 16:24.149
so he kills her.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.942
You don't want to be that woman .

16:30.281 --> 16:31.698
Go ahead .

16:36.537 --> 16:40.082
Oh , please. Whatever it says
is going to seem related to this.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.334
"You are your own worst enemy."

16:43.544 --> 16:44.961
That's yours.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.892
You look tired .

16:58.976 --> 17:00.811
I am .

17:02.105 --> 17:04.356
You're working too much .

17:06.401 --> 17:08.694
No, it's just--

17:11.989 --> 17:13.657
Maybe.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.998
It's too hot in here anyway.

17:31.926 --> 17:36.012
You know, we're losing a lot of our cool air
through the windows in the dining room?

17:38.641 --> 17:39.933
What?

17:40.017 --> 17:43.019
Nothing , It's just something
the salesman said .

17:44.021 --> 17:45.981
What was he doing
in the dining room?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.984
What are you talking about?

17:51.529 --> 17:53.488
You let a stranger in my house?

17:53.573 --> 17:54.656
Don't raise your voice.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.491
I damn well will raise my voice.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.869
Do you have any idea
what could have happened?

17:58.953 --> 18:01.204
I could have bought an air conditioner.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.956
It's hot.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.917
Salesmen go into people's
homes every day.

18:06.002 --> 18:09.296
It's like when you
turn on a television set

18:09.380 --> 18:11.590
and then you turn it off, it--

18:11.674 --> 18:13.508
Look, you didn't want
to spend the money--

18:13.593 --> 18:15.010
Good night, Betty.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.073
I feel like I should make a speech .

18:38.951 --> 18:40.410
Get back to work.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.581
Welcome back. You look good .

18:46.083 --> 18:47.501
Honey.

18:47.585 --> 18:50.003
One hour. That's all you get.

18:52.089 --> 18:54.007
You be a good boy.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.012
I shall be both dog and pony.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.096
Come on .

19:04.352 --> 19:05.894
He looks like death .

19:05.978 --> 19:10.023
I know. His hair and his skin
are the same color.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.691
Not really.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.950
That's the spot--
exactly where it happened .

19:20.034 --> 19:21.743
I can still feel it.

19:29.794 --> 19:34.714
Miss Holloway, we brought you here
because of your discretion .

19:34.799 --> 19:38.093
Can you help us with this? His color?

19:39.095 --> 19:40.554
Hey, honey.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.058
Well, you know,
we don't need Miami Beach ,

19:45.142 --> 19:47.143
but, uh , just do what you can do.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.907
Can I kiss you?

20:00.992 --> 20:03.368
I don't know if I could handle it.

20:20.094 --> 20:24.514
We should have done this
for Nixon before the debates.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.100
Oh , the arrogance of that campaign .

20:27.184 --> 20:29.102
It's infuriating .

20:29.186 --> 20:31.104
Being the incumbent is even harder.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.732
You can't just sit on your ass
and look presidential.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.150
You probably shouldn't get so upset.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.068
It's not good for you .

20:37.153 --> 20:39.446
I missed you .

20:39.530 --> 20:41.114
You know that, right?

20:43.284 --> 20:45.118
I missed you , too.

20:45.202 --> 20:49.205
Oh, Joannie, Joannie,
look at that mouth .

20:51.584 --> 20:53.001
You're not doing my lips.

20:53.085 --> 20:55.128
My rouge is too dark,

20:55.212 --> 20:57.839
but I have this light lipstick.

20:57.924 --> 21:00.884
You'll draw freckles on me, too,
like Raggedy Andy?

21:04.430 --> 21:07.015
Look, I want to tell you something

21:07.099 --> 21:08.850
because you're very dear to me,

21:08.935 --> 21:11.144
and I hope you understand
it comes from the bottom

21:11.228 --> 21:14.230
of my. . .damaged , damaged heart.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.864
You are the finest piece of ass I ever had ,

21:22.949 --> 21:25.951
and I don't care who knows it.

21:26.035 --> 21:29.454
I am so glad I got to roam those hillsides.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.538
Stop it.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.207
I mean it.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.833
I've had a lot of time

21:33.918 --> 21:37.504
to think about the things I've done
and been sorry about,

21:37.588 --> 21:39.589
and being with you is not one of them .

21:46.263 --> 21:48.264
Oh , Red .

21:52.103 --> 21:54.229
That's not what I wanted .

21:56.273 --> 21:58.233
You look better.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.920
I should have come over.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.755
That's a silly idea.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.215
Damn it.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.635
Soon the milk stains
are going to meet the sweat stains.

22:28.973 --> 22:32.058
Should we get out of here and let her sleep?

22:32.143 --> 22:35.103
I'd love to, but the door's
noisier than our talking.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.647
She's actually
a good sleeper, thank God,

22:37.732 --> 22:40.233
even with the heat rash .

22:40.317 --> 22:41.609
Poor thing .

22:41.694 --> 22:44.362
And it actually gets hotter at night.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.074
Did you think about
buying an air conditioner

22:48.159 --> 22:49.617
from that pushy young man yesterday?

22:49.702 --> 22:52.328
Is that what he was selling?

22:53.748 --> 22:57.250
He looked like one
of Carlton's squash buddies.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.252
Made me sorry I answered the door.

22:59.336 --> 23:02.005
He was very pushy.

23:02.089 --> 23:05.258
He came in and started measuring things.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.260
Don was not happy about that.

23:07.344 --> 23:08.261
Don was there?

23:08.345 --> 23:09.679
No.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.643
Carlton would break my arm .

23:17.396 --> 23:19.939
It was foolish letting him in .

23:27.656 --> 23:29.741
Why would you tell him?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.412
It just came up.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.167
I wasn't thinking .

23:39.251 --> 23:40.418
What did he do?

23:40.503 --> 23:42.253
What do you think?

23:42.338 --> 23:44.130
He lost his temper.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.010
He's very protective.

23:53.057 --> 23:56.309
Just as you requested ,
a little of our local color:

23:56.393 --> 23:58.520
pastrami, cole slaw, sour pickles.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.147
I like it.

24:01.232 --> 24:02.690
It's Yankee barbecue.

24:04.610 --> 24:06.402
Yeah .

24:10.032 --> 24:11.407
They're all ours.

24:13.035 --> 24:15.870
Here they are now.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.330
- Roger.
- Hello, Lee.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.332
- Hello, Don .
- Lee.

24:19.416 --> 24:22.877
Jimmy, Preston, how do you do?

24:24.130 --> 24:25.755
It's wonderful to see you .

24:25.840 --> 24:27.340
Well , from what I hear,

24:27.424 --> 24:29.676
you boys had all but
given me up for dead .

24:29.760 --> 24:30.927
I don't think it's wrong

24:31.011 --> 24:34.347
for us to express our concern
for your well-being .

24:34.431 --> 24:38.685
Well, I know how much
you love your delicatessen .

24:38.769 --> 24:42.105
But I know
there's also something else

24:42.189 --> 24:43.731
you want to discuss.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.359
You're worried about losing the lawsuit?

24:46.443 --> 24:48.278
There were no damages.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.487
But we lost.

24:49.572 --> 24:50.738
But there were no damages.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.366
Blame is one thing, malice is another.

24:53.450 --> 24:57.370
I worked my way inside
and out of the FTC.

24:57.454 --> 25:01.166
Bought a lot of dinners in Washington .

25:01.250 --> 25:02.959
You can't fight them .

25:03.043 --> 25:04.961
That's what lawyers are for.

25:05.045 --> 25:09.007
Lawyers? I've seen
a girl fight harder on her first date

25:09.091 --> 25:11.092
than these DC shuttlecocks.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.388
Listen , I'm a stockholder,

25:15.472 --> 25:17.974
so I called Chester Conrad
in the Surgeon General's office,

25:18.058 --> 25:20.393
and he assured me it would
be at least three years

25:20.477 --> 25:21.853
before they could compile a report.

25:21.937 --> 25:23.938
But legislation is in progress.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.857
We hear another year or two beyond that.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.401
They speculate they're going to put
warning signs on the packages.

25:28.485 --> 25:31.404
There's still plenty of time
before we have to worry about that,

25:31.488 --> 25:34.407
during which we wait
to see if share drops off

25:34.491 --> 25:37.493
before we run for the hills
looking for a new campaign .

25:38.746 --> 25:39.913
Is that true?

25:39.997 --> 25:42.832
Well, it must be. He just said it.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.878
Well, I've been spending
a lot of time with my wife.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.507
I'm glad we came by.

25:51.592 --> 25:54.093
I missed you all .

25:54.178 --> 25:55.887
You New Yorkers.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.099
To New Yorkers.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.517
May they always--

26:03.520 --> 26:05.355
Oh , Jesus. Not again .

26:05.439 --> 26:07.607
Are you okay?

26:07.691 --> 26:10.109
Just give him some air.
Give him some air.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.444
Give him air.

26:19.870 --> 26:20.995
- I'm okay.
- Don't talk.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.455
This was stupid . I'll get the elevator.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.916
No, they're holding the elevator.

26:27.211 --> 26:28.544
I'm very sorry.

26:36.178 --> 26:39.931
Mona, sweetheart, this was a mistake.

26:40.015 --> 26:43.059
I tried to talk him
out of it, but you people.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.687
Mrs. Sterling, I had no idea.

26:45.771 --> 26:50.024
I used to think you couldn't
put a value on a human life,

26:50.109 --> 26:52.318
but I never asked Bert Cooper, did I?

26:52.403 --> 26:53.486
Sweetheart--

26:53.570 --> 26:54.988
Go to hell , Bert.

27:03.664 --> 27:07.000
I don't need to tell you that Don
has everything under control.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.835
I don't know.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.712
Without Sterling--

27:10.796 --> 27:12.672
I may have a family business,

27:12.756 --> 27:14.549
but I'm not an autocrat.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.010
I have a board ,

27:17.094 --> 27:22.390
and my son wants to be the executive
of an aluminum company.

27:22.474 --> 27:28.187
Ah, still, your board
should give credit where credit is due.

27:28.272 --> 27:29.939
Share?

27:30.024 --> 27:33.109
We all like Don Draper,

27:33.193 --> 27:36.195
but if I was you,
I'd find some way to show him

27:36.280 --> 27:39.115
that you all do, too.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.534
He's a dead man, you know,
even if he survives.

27:41.618 --> 27:42.577
What are you talking about?

27:42.661 --> 27:45.330
Most clients will put up
with one coronary from a partner.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.165
Cost of doing business. Two?

27:47.249 --> 27:48.791
Are we going down?

27:48.876 --> 27:51.753
I wrote, prepared ,
and sent out my resume this afternoon ,

27:51.837 --> 27:53.796
at company expense.

27:53.881 --> 27:56.632
Look, it doesn't take a genius
to see what's going to happen .

27:56.717 --> 27:58.134
They'll bump Draper up to partner.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.385
Everyone will fall in line.

27:59.470 --> 28:00.553
Draper.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.555
It would have happened a long time ago

28:02.639 --> 28:03.598
if they weren't so greedy.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.433
They're already paying him
his weight in gold .

28:05.517 --> 28:07.018
Half the accounts
at this agency came for Draper.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.562
Frank Birmingham brings in
a lot of accounts.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.522
Come on . You sit
in that conference room .

28:11.607 --> 28:12.732
Frank Birmingham brings them in ,

28:12.816 --> 28:14.525
and while they're dozing off,

28:14.610 --> 28:15.860
Don goes through their wallets.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.571
What about Mitch Sullivan in Media?

28:18.655 --> 28:21.074
He's fat, bald , and charmless.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.951
You think Draper likes me?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.745
He rides me pretty hard sometimes.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.413
It's hard to tell with him .

28:27.498 --> 28:28.581
He likes you .

28:28.665 --> 28:29.624
I work at it.

28:29.708 --> 28:30.875
I work at it, too.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.126
I can tell you do.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.711
You never know when he's doing it.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.839
There's not a man in this room

28:36.924 --> 28:38.758
who's not holding Don Draper
on their shoulders

28:38.842 --> 28:40.426
so that he can reach partner.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.595
He's not going to fire you .

28:42.679 --> 28:44.013
Who said anything about that?

28:44.098 --> 28:45.598
No one. It's just--

28:45.682 --> 28:47.600
You don't think he deserves it, do you?

28:47.684 --> 28:50.645
Campbell, don't you
know anything about business,

28:50.729 --> 28:52.480
cleaning out the old guys?

28:52.564 --> 28:54.899
It's good for us. It opens up spots.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.446
My ma, she wouldn't shut up about you .

29:00.531 --> 29:02.240
I told her I remembered you .

29:02.324 --> 29:04.283
Isn't that nice?

29:07.413 --> 29:08.621
You smoke.

29:08.705 --> 29:09.872
All the time.

29:09.957 --> 29:13.000
It's practically mandatory in our office.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.509
Thank you .

29:23.846 --> 29:28.349
Brandy Alexander for La Donna,
and a Rheingold .

29:34.440 --> 29:36.566
What, you don't like it? I'll send it back.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.651
Well, my friend Joan
always orders them for me.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.486
They're usually sweeter.

29:43.073 --> 29:45.575
She's a scream .

29:45.659 --> 29:47.994
She lives in the city.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.167
There's a bar in Manhattan
where the glasses are chilled .

29:56.879 --> 29:57.879
What's in that?

29:57.963 --> 29:59.464
I don't know.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.929
So you drive a truck.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.307
Yes.

30:09.391 --> 30:11.392
But I bought my own route.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.686
Wise potato chips.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.271
Really?

30:15.355 --> 30:16.689
Yeah .

30:16.773 --> 30:19.901
I have an area that's just mine.

30:20.027 --> 30:24.071
The route was expensive,
but the hard part was learning that truck.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.823
Special license.

30:25.908 --> 30:27.700
We have a potato chip account:

30:27.784 --> 30:28.784
Utz.

30:28.869 --> 30:30.828
You get free ones? I do.

30:30.913 --> 30:33.080
I don't know. I don't like potato chips.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.209
You live out here, right?

30:36.293 --> 30:39.086
Prospect Park.
I have my own apartment.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.006
Well , I share it
with my roommate Marjorie.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.799
She's a character.

30:49.765 --> 30:53.518
My sister's a secretary
for Bulova in Flushing .

30:54.811 --> 30:57.855
I just got a new account the other day.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.733
I already wrote copy
for Belle Jolie lipsticks.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.735
It's going to be in a bunch of magazines.

31:02.819 --> 31:03.986
Which ones?

31:04.071 --> 31:05.530
I don't think you read them .

31:05.614 --> 31:06.822
They're about high fashion .

31:08.408 --> 31:10.743
Advertising doesn't work on me.

31:10.827 --> 31:15.039
It's just a lot of people screaming at you
from the walls and the TV.

31:15.123 --> 31:18.042
If advertising is good ,
people never think it works.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.585
How do they know it does?

31:19.670 --> 31:21.003
Did they ever prove that?

31:22.506 --> 31:24.840
Why are you insulting what I do?

31:26.218 --> 31:27.885
"So you drive a truck."

31:29.304 --> 31:30.888
You do.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.765
I'm my own boss, you know?

31:32.849 --> 31:35.142
You get off the train
every day at Grand Central ,

31:35.227 --> 31:36.686
and they spray you with gold?

31:36.770 --> 31:40.773
Let me tell you,
you can act like you're from Manhattan ,

31:40.857 --> 31:43.150
but you don't look like those girls.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.787
Hey, hold on .

31:54.871 --> 31:56.706
That wasn't nice.

31:56.790 --> 31:57.832
I feel sorry for you .

31:57.916 --> 31:59.333
I said I'm sorry.

32:02.963 --> 32:06.090
Those people? I n Manhattan?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.801
They are better than us,

32:08.885 --> 32:11.679
because they want things
they haven't seen.

32:16.351 --> 32:17.810
The Danny Thomas Show

32:17.894 --> 32:21.606
was brought to you
tonight by Post cereals.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.817
All fine products of General Foods.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.485
Post cereals.

32:26.570 --> 32:28.446
And now--

32:32.909 --> 32:35.244
I'll be up,
I want to check on Roger.

32:35.329 --> 32:36.996
Okay.

32:46.673 --> 32:47.840
Hello.

32:47.924 --> 32:50.384
Hello. It's Don Draper.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.428
What can I do for you?

32:52.512 --> 32:54.472
I don't know
what you do for anybody.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.932
Mr. Draper, you sound hostile.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.434
After hundreds of dollars,

32:58.518 --> 33:01.520
all you've managed to do
is make her more unhappy.

33:01.605 --> 33:04.857
I understand this is frustrating for you .

33:04.941 --> 33:07.568
This has nothing to do with me. It's her.

33:07.653 --> 33:09.862
You took a woman
with a bad case of nerves,

33:09.946 --> 33:12.323
and you made her weaker, not stronger.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.534
I'm afraid to leave her alone.

33:15.619 --> 33:20.498
All I can say is that it's a process,
and time is part of it.

33:20.582 --> 33:21.874
If you'd like to expedite things,

33:21.958 --> 33:23.542
we can put her in psychoanalysis.

33:23.627 --> 33:24.877
What are you doing now?

33:24.961 --> 33:26.921
Psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

33:27.047 --> 33:31.967
Psychoanalysis would mean a minimum
of three sessions a week and optimally five.

33:33.887 --> 33:35.346
Thank you .

33:35.430 --> 33:37.306
I'll think about that.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.903
Over there.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.530
There's no chair.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.708
I really wish I could have
come in and prepared first.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.793
Sorry. This is the way it works.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.378
Of course.

34:10.340 --> 34:12.800
I only have one and a carbon .

34:12.884 --> 34:15.177
That's all I had time to do.
You'll have to share.

34:15.262 --> 34:17.263
Come on . Just give it to one of the girls.

34:24.020 --> 34:25.062
Ready when you are.

34:27.899 --> 34:31.694
Women lose weight so they'll
feel good about themselves:

34:31.778 --> 34:35.865
healthier, more attractive.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.324
Rejuvenate has a Latin root

34:37.409 --> 34:40.661
which literally means "the return of youth ."

34:40.746 --> 34:44.957
The Rejuvenator
gives you the flush and glow

34:45.041 --> 34:47.960
not only that you might have
after hours of exercise

34:48.044 --> 34:50.504
but certainly as a young girl .

34:50.589 --> 34:55.509
Isn't it nice to feel that way
whenever you want?

34:55.594 --> 34:57.970
Combined with a sensible diet,

34:58.054 --> 35:00.097
The Rejuvenator.

35:00.182 --> 35:02.850
You'll love the way it makes you feel .

35:07.981 --> 35:11.567
Look, I'm not going to wait
to see how Don lands on this.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.152
I'm going to tell you it's good .

35:13.236 --> 35:15.863
Nice end run around the weight loss.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.824
I think it's good , too.
But what does it do?

35:25.081 --> 35:26.457
From what I understand ,

35:26.541 --> 35:30.252
it provides the pleasure of a man
without the man .

35:31.546 --> 35:33.756
We've been replaced?

35:33.840 --> 35:36.091
That's why M itch's wife
didn't want to take it off.

35:38.845 --> 35:40.513
Oh, I'd love to see her in that.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.306
Oof, she's already so hot to trot.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.517
4th of July, that gingham halter

35:44.601 --> 35:46.018
with the knot at the bottom?

35:46.102 --> 35:47.353
She was falling out of it.

35:47.437 --> 35:48.979
Jayne Mansfield .

35:50.148 --> 35:52.441
M itch's wife is very attractive.

35:52.526 --> 35:55.027
Oh , I-- I don't know her.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.112
First of all, no Latin.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.031
You sound like a valedictorian .

35:59.115 --> 36:01.325
And the name still isn't right.

36:01.409 --> 36:06.247
Lastly, you still might need to give us
a hint at what it does.

36:08.124 --> 36:10.042
I could be more explicit.

36:10.126 --> 36:14.421
I was thinking of calling it stimulating .

36:14.506 --> 36:16.257
I think you need , like, a code word,

36:16.341 --> 36:19.218
uh , like-- I don't know.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.719
Like refreshing .

36:20.804 --> 36:22.471
I'll think about that.

36:22.556 --> 36:25.057
Oh, my God . Freddie,
doesn't your wife have one?

36:25.141 --> 36:27.434
What's your point, Ken?

36:27.519 --> 36:30.062
My point is, didn't you say she loved it?

36:30.146 --> 36:31.939
That's funny.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.066
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:34.150 --> 36:37.987
Freddie, Sal,
you know what to do here.

36:38.071 --> 36:40.322
I'll get arrested just doing the layouts.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.409
Now. . .

36:43.493 --> 36:45.160
that wasn't so bad .

36:50.500 --> 36:52.293
Looks like everybody liked it.

36:53.295 --> 36:55.170
I can tell .

36:57.173 --> 37:00.551
Uh , Freddie's wife does not look like Mitch's,

37:00.635 --> 37:02.261
you know.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.557
Good work, Pegs.

38:49.285 --> 38:50.828
Come in .

38:53.289 --> 38:56.750
Mr. Draper, I don't want to seem ungrateful,

38:56.835 --> 39:00.212
but I think I could serve Sterling Cooper
and you better as a copywriter

39:00.296 --> 39:01.463
if I had my own desk.

39:01.548 --> 39:03.298
You have a desk.

39:04.926 --> 39:07.219
But now I have radio spots.

39:07.303 --> 39:12.224
Peggy, the conversation of a raise
is not inappropriate at this moment,

39:12.308 --> 39:13.809
but do not be timid .

39:13.893 --> 39:17.604
You presented like a man ,
Now act like one.

39:17.689 --> 39:20.816
I want $5.00 a week more.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.360
Jesus, what do you make?

39:23.445 --> 39:25.696
$35 a week.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.949
Well, that's a 1 5% kick.

39:30.326 --> 39:33.328
Don , a word .

39:43.381 --> 39:46.050
Cooper and Draper just
went into Sterling's office.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.509
Tell me when they
come out of there, will you?

39:47.594 --> 39:50.512
Sure. I'll just sit here and watch the door.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.056
That's all I'll do.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.974
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

40:03.359 --> 40:04.651
Is he dead?

40:04.736 --> 40:06.278
No. Quite the opposite.

40:06.362 --> 40:08.322
They let him go home to convalesce.

40:08.406 --> 40:10.199
And?

40:11.367 --> 40:13.368
I want to make you a partner.

40:16.998 --> 40:20.918
As a symbolic gesture,
I think telling me that in here is in bad taste.

40:21.002 --> 40:23.504
That's the way it works.
Roger knows that.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.881
I'm not adding your name
to the masthead .

40:25.965 --> 40:28.842
I'm restoring faith to our clients.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.303
I accept.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.138
I'll start you at 1 2%

40:33.223 --> 40:35.057
and see how both you and Roger do.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.101
Of course you'll remain creative director,

40:37.185 --> 40:41.313
and to fill the position
of head of account services,

40:41.397 --> 40:44.191
you are the only member
of the blue ribbon committee.

40:44.275 --> 40:46.860
Do I hire from inside or outside?

40:46.945 --> 40:51.323
I just made you partner,
Do I have to do everything?

40:51.407 --> 40:53.200
No contract.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.956
Of course you'd say that.

40:59.040 --> 41:01.750
Beware the nonconformist.

41:04.420 --> 41:09.383
I'm going to introduce you
to Miss Ayn Rand .

41:09.467 --> 41:11.426
I think she'll salivate.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.442
Is he dead?

41:28.778 --> 41:29.820
No.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.446
So when's he coming back?

41:34.534 --> 41:37.244
You know, I think this office
is too big for me.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.080
I might need it if I'm going
to lure in Marty Brennen

41:40.165 --> 41:41.373
as head of account services.

41:41.457 --> 41:44.376
Then it's true. Congratulations.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.420
- Thank you ,
- I mean it.

41:47.422 --> 41:48.589
You know I admire your work.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.382
I believe you .

41:50.466 --> 41:52.134
I hope you do.

41:52.218 --> 41:55.971
And I don't think it can be denied
that we make a very good team .

41:59.058 --> 42:00.601
You know what?

42:02.020 --> 42:03.729
I do like this office.

42:03.813 --> 42:05.939
I think Roger would want me to have it.

42:06.024 --> 42:08.400
That way he'll always know
he can have it back.

42:08.484 --> 42:11.612
I hope you're aware that I'd love
to throw my hat in the ring .

42:13.281 --> 42:15.032
I am now.

42:30.673 --> 42:34.092
Peggy, we have both had very good days.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.053
You may leave your post.

42:36.137 --> 42:38.430
It's 4:30.

42:38.514 --> 42:40.891
I'm sorry. That's the best
I can do at this point.

42:40.975 --> 42:43.435
I have work to do.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.980
You can have your raise.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.816
And I'll talk to Miss Holloway
about getting somebody on your desk

42:49.901 --> 42:51.526
while you attend to your assignment.

42:53.154 --> 42:54.446
Can I tell her?

42:54.530 --> 42:55.989
Sure.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.450
In the meantime, go with your friends.

42:58.534 --> 42:59.493
Celebrate.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.037
Good night, Mr. Draper.

43:17.220 --> 43:18.428
Good night.

44:12.150 --> 44:13.525
Mr. Draper?

44:18.197 --> 44:19.323
Good night.

44:47.643 --> 44:48.894
Back away from the set.

44:48.978 --> 44:51.772
Come on . You'll burn your eyes out.

44:51.856 --> 44:53.648
H i, Daddy.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.277
Uh, I would have made you dinner,

44:57.362 --> 45:00.572
but I called the office,
and no one answered .

45:00.656 --> 45:02.199
Should I fix something?

45:02.283 --> 45:04.743
No. I was supposed to have
a meeting with a client,

45:04.827 --> 45:06.328
but it got cancelled .

45:16.214 --> 45:18.590
I got made partner.

45:18.674 --> 45:21.802
Oh , my God . Don , that's wonderful .

45:26.933 --> 45:30.477
Don , you were right
about letting people in the house.

45:30.561 --> 45:31.937
I'm so sorry.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.317
I don't want to talk about that.

45:47.370 --> 45:50.038
The heat's supposed to break tomorrow.

45:50.123 --> 45:53.041
It'll probably be snowing in two weeks.
