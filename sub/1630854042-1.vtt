00:07.966 --> 00:12.846
I am so happy and honored and overjoyed
to be here tonight,

00:12.929 --> 00:15.390
introducing one of my best friends

00:15.473 --> 00:19.185
and one of my favorite comedians
in the entire world:

00:19.728 --> 00:22.313
Sheng Wang!

00:22.397 --> 00:25.066
[crowd cheers, applauds]

00:25.150 --> 00:28.361
[hip-hop music plays]

00:37.620 --> 00:39.289
Ali Wong, everybody. Ali Wong.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.669
Thank you. Thank you so very much.

00:44.753 --> 00:48.089
I am… super excited
and grateful to be here.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.301
You know, as you get older,

00:51.384 --> 00:53.511
you do a lot of things
for the very first time.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.597
This is the nature of growing up.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.601
But sometimes, you do things
you thought you would never, ever do.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.187
Like, I recently bought pants from Costco.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.439
[crowd laughs]

01:04.522 --> 01:07.609
That's a big deal.
That's a new chapter in your life.

01:08.443 --> 01:11.863
Because when you buy pants from Costco,
that's when you don't care anymore.

01:13.948 --> 01:17.952
That's when we let go of our egos
and we begin our spiritual journey.

01:20.955 --> 01:22.373
-[crowd cheers]
-Right?

01:24.584 --> 01:26.294
You hear people say stuff, and go,

01:26.377 --> 01:29.672
"I'm not concerned about others' opinions.
I don't care what they think."

01:29.756 --> 01:30.799
"That is just talk."

01:31.299 --> 01:34.511
Until you back it up
with the Costco pants purchase.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.890
That's how you let him know he for real.
He don't give a damn for real.

01:39.474 --> 01:41.184
He wanted the Kirkland pants.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.396
Don't mess with them.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.441
When you see somebody wearing
Kirkland pants, you know two things.

01:48.525 --> 01:51.319
Number one, they do what it takes to live.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.324
Number two,
but they not afraid to die anymore.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.832
Because Costco teaches you how to let go.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.710
Before I get to the store, in my car,

02:07.794 --> 02:10.130
I do a quick little
meditation-slash-pep rally.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.508
I say we're about to go
to a hostile environment.

02:14.634 --> 02:17.470
You already know
there's gonna be some injustice.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.306
There's gonna be straight-up atrocities.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.643
Speak up when you can,
accept things you cannot change.

02:23.726 --> 02:24.602
That's Costco.

02:27.147 --> 02:31.568
If I can't find parking
in under eight minutes, I drive away.

02:32.735 --> 02:35.738
Let it go, dude.
That's okay. Today is not the day.

02:37.157 --> 02:41.578
I'm not going to force it. It's Costco.
I'm gonna respect it like the ocean.

02:43.538 --> 02:47.000
That's not my schedule.
That's the moon, that's the tides.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.920
Costco is bigger than all of us.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.428
A lot of change going on.
I don't know when this happened.

02:58.511 --> 03:03.141
I just recently found out
that my preferred mainstream candy bar

03:04.225 --> 03:06.853
is now Mounds.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.774
It's just surprising, right?
Because we all know

03:12.859 --> 03:13.985
that's gross.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.655
That's gross, dude.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.659
If you don't know what Mounds is,
it's like Almond Joy,

03:22.243 --> 03:23.578
but there's no almond.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.248
There's no joy.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.668
It's a lot of coconut.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.297
Ooh, baby, this candy is fibrous.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.384
Maybe this candy got prebiotics.

03:41.471 --> 03:42.555
Mounds

03:43.139 --> 03:44.724
is a bad name.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.771
I don't get it.
The sister product is Almond Joy.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.482
That's a crucial ingredient
plus a positive emotion.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.568
Almond Joy. Not a bad name.
Somebody worked on that.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.406
Who approved Mounds?

04:02.075 --> 04:03.868
Did they ever see the product?

04:04.953 --> 04:06.788
Because it's brown and chunky.

04:08.373 --> 04:13.503
Mounds is a good name
if your only other option was Piles.

04:18.549 --> 04:21.511
I eat my Mounds weird.
I developed a little ritual of my own.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.723
What I do is I open my candy bar
and then I pour a side of almonds.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.642
These are a separate purchase.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.938
And then I make my own joy.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.817
I shove the almonds into my Mounds.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.069
Way more than you get
from a regular Almond Joy.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.113
I pack it all up in there, real crunchy.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.198
Then I eat it like dog medicine.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.574
[crowd laughs]

04:49.205 --> 04:51.457
I'm blessed, y'all. I'm blessed, dude.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.713
But some things you assume your whole life

04:56.796 --> 04:59.132
you thought you were gonna do,
you might not get to.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.509
I'm learning this now, you know.
Up until recently…

05:03.469 --> 05:05.305
I thought I was gonna own a house.

05:06.848 --> 05:09.809
I thought maybe I was gonna own
property on both coasts, you know.

05:09.892 --> 05:15.189
Now I'm like, man, it would be real nice
if I had a deeper kitchen sink.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.902
I want that.
I went to my friend's house, I was like,

05:19.986 --> 05:21.946
"Dang, that's spacious, dude."

05:22.613 --> 05:24.907
"That's so spacious.
You live a good life, man."

05:24.991 --> 05:26.075
"Congratulations."

05:26.993 --> 05:29.370
"I bet whenever you wash
your cookie sheets,

05:29.454 --> 05:32.457
you never accidentally
flood your countertops, huh?"

05:33.041 --> 05:34.292
Oops.

05:35.752 --> 05:39.255
You don't know how I live.
We different. We different, dude.

05:40.465 --> 05:44.010
It's incredible how much water
comes off of a cookie sheet, though.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.014
It's wild. It's always a surprise.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.475
It's like an optical illusion.

05:50.558 --> 05:53.561
It's so thin
you don't recognize it as a threat.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.149
You probably tired,
get a little loosey-goosey with it, right?

05:58.232 --> 06:02.320
Suddenly, bam! "Oh no!
Now my vitamins are in a lagoon."

06:05.365 --> 06:08.659
Next time you have a housewife,
forget the bucket, grab a cookie sheet.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.749
I've been thinking about how,
when I was younger,

06:14.832 --> 06:17.293
I used to walk into a bookstore
full of wonder.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.421
When I was a kid,
I walked into a bookstore like,

06:20.505 --> 06:22.882
"Look at all this stuff I'm gonna learn."

06:23.591 --> 06:26.052
As a grown-up,
I walk into a bookstore like,

06:26.135 --> 06:28.679
"Look at all this stuff
I'm never gonna know."

06:31.891 --> 06:35.978
Ooh. It's hard, man. It's hard to see
your ignorance alphabetized.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.023
I don't like that.

06:39.941 --> 06:43.236
I'm at the Staff Picks section.
I'm like, "Of all the things I don't know,

06:43.319 --> 06:45.154
these are Brian's favorites."

06:50.159 --> 06:53.413
It's overwhelming to be surrounded
by so much knowledge all at once.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.790
You can see it so clearly,
but you can't have it.

06:55.873 --> 06:59.502
It's just teasing you,
like a strip club for wisdom.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.385
I try to read a little bit every night.
Make it a habit, you know?

07:07.468 --> 07:09.887
The only problem is,
I fall asleep too quickly

07:11.013 --> 07:13.015
Books are stronger than melatonin.

07:14.642 --> 07:18.604
Just get you a book, dude.
It's about 50 milligrams a page.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.985
It's natural, it's fast-acting.
The side effects include learning.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.699
Eight hours, no problem. Put the book
on your nightstand by your bed.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.869
You wake up in the middle of the night,
see your book, go back down.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.579
[crowd laughs]

07:34.662 --> 07:35.830
No, thank you.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.290
It's bedtime, bro.

07:40.918 --> 07:44.046
I've been reading a book for a few weeks.
I'm still at the preface.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.259
That's not even the book yet, man.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.970
It don't count
when the page numbers are still letters.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.225
I always pack a book, you know,
when I'm on tour,

07:56.309 --> 07:59.228
afternoon at the beach, a picnic,
I always bring a book.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.730
I just don't read it.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.233
I'm not well-read,
but my books are well-traveled.

08:05.902 --> 08:09.155
It's nice to be my books.
I'll show you the world, girl.

08:13.075 --> 08:16.537
I don't know-- I got to be better
about my time management, you know?

08:16.621 --> 08:19.540
Like, I don't know how many more years
I'll be on this world,

08:19.624 --> 08:22.084
but, like, at the rate
that I read right now,

08:22.168 --> 08:24.337
I feel like I got about eight books left.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.632
I gotta pick wisely, you know?

08:28.216 --> 08:30.218
I got an email from The New York Times.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.637
They're like, "Here's 73 books
to read this summer."

08:33.930 --> 08:35.723
I'm like, "You don't know me at all, man."

08:36.682 --> 08:37.850
Unsubscribe.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.853
Seventy-three books. [chuckles]

08:40.937 --> 08:42.855
This summer, I'm gonna read one book

08:43.648 --> 08:45.525
or I'm gonna read this email.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.527
[crowd laughs]

08:48.653 --> 08:50.655
The uprate load is too slow.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.075
I read too slow.
I wish I could just plug it in, you know?

08:54.951 --> 08:58.663
Like The Matrix. You know that port?
Just put the port in there like that.

08:58.746 --> 08:59.956
[moans]

09:00.039 --> 09:02.208
7 Habits of Highly Effective People.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.293
[crowd laughs]

09:10.841 --> 09:14.262
I'm a procrastinator, man.
It's really bad. It's a problem, you know?

09:14.345 --> 09:16.514
Like, I haven't even finished
writing this joke yet.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.643
It's so severe, man. It's so severe.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.645
I'm worried eventually my bucket list

09:22.728 --> 09:25.231
is just gonna be a bunch of errands
I haven't run yet.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.776
How sad would that be
if my doctor was like,

09:28.859 --> 09:32.238
"You got a few months left to live,"
I'd be like, "Dang, I got to hurry up

09:32.321 --> 09:33.990
and frame these photos."

09:35.408 --> 09:38.160
"I've been living with bare walls
like I'm an assassin."

09:44.208 --> 09:46.294
One goal I've been working on
for a long time.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.462
I've been working on having good posture.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.090
It's hard, dude.
I don't know if I'll get there.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.801
My whole life, my whole life,
I have slouched

09:53.884 --> 09:55.720
because I'm super humble.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.972
[crowd laughs]

09:58.055 --> 09:59.599
I'm a good dude, you know?

10:00.808 --> 10:03.436
I see that as the default, right?

10:03.519 --> 10:06.772
When I see somebody stand up straight,
I don't believe that's natural.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.985
I feel like they doing it on purpose.
I'm like, "You trying to flex on me?"

10:12.486 --> 10:15.990
I can do that too. I can also pretend
like I believe in myself.

10:23.581 --> 10:27.293
I've slouched for so long
it feels normal, it feels comfortable.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.337
It feels like
I'm sending the right message.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.173
It's like, "Hey, nobody hurt this guy."

10:33.507 --> 10:35.676
No, man. He already broken.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.762
[crow laughs]

10:38.471 --> 10:39.639
I feel safe.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.393
If you don't know me,
I'm originally from Texas.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.853
I grew up in Houston.

10:45.936 --> 10:49.231
I went to the same middle school
as Beyoncé.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.566
[crowd cheers]

10:50.650 --> 10:52.568
That's crazy, right? Beyoncé.

10:53.277 --> 10:54.278
And me.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.405
[crowd laughs]

10:56.489 --> 10:58.824
That's wild.
Beyoncé alone is a pretty big deal.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.702
Then you find out Sheng Wang
came from the same part of town.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.454
That's like,
"Wow, that's a lot of talent."

11:03.537 --> 11:04.872
[crowd laughs]

11:05.456 --> 11:07.500
Must have been
something in that water, y'all.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.251
[crowd whistles]

11:10.836 --> 11:15.257
I was raised with Buddhist philosophies,
but I'm very open-minded, you know?

11:15.341 --> 11:19.053
I will go to any church
that has a basketball court.

11:22.223 --> 11:25.851
That's my exercise.
I play basketball for cardio, all right?

11:25.935 --> 11:27.520
But not just with anybody.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.899
Every Tuesday, I meet
a specific group of friends at the park,

11:31.982 --> 11:34.819
because we all suck
and nobody wants to get hurt.

11:36.737 --> 11:40.616
It's a kind game.
I never talk trash, but I giggle a lot.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.662
Yeah, because my mind
wants to do all these things

11:44.745 --> 11:46.789
that my body does not execute.

11:47.581 --> 11:51.085
When I get the ball my mind's like,
"Okay, we gonna do a crossover."

11:51.168 --> 11:55.423
"We're gonna do a spin move, and finish
with a very graceful finger roll."

11:56.048 --> 12:00.177
And my body's like, "Actually,
we're gonna pass this ball out of bounds."

12:00.261 --> 12:02.346
[crowd laughs]

12:02.430 --> 12:04.390
"Turnover. Giggle time."

12:10.604 --> 12:11.897
It's a public space.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.860
I can't control if other people
want to shoot hoops,

12:15.943 --> 12:19.029
but I can tell if I don't want to play
with somebody right away.

12:19.113 --> 12:22.366
Like, one red flag is if they look fit.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.246
[scoffs] I'm like,
"Oh, you healthy, huh? Okay."

12:27.747 --> 12:30.708
"That's good, man. That's good for you.
I bet you've got skills."

12:31.208 --> 12:32.835
"But that's not what this is about."

12:33.836 --> 12:38.340
"No, man, me and my friends, everybody,
we all here because we got diseases."

12:39.425 --> 12:42.928
"High blood pressure,
high cholesterol, diabetes, fatty liver."

12:43.012 --> 12:45.765
"We're not here to play games.
We here to delay death."

12:45.848 --> 12:48.184
[crowd laughs]

12:48.267 --> 12:50.728
"You can come back with a doctor's note."

12:55.149 --> 12:57.735
I love those dudes, you know?
They're very special to me.

12:57.818 --> 13:01.322
They're the most random group of friends
I've ever made in my whole life,

13:01.405 --> 13:03.282
because they're all grown men

13:04.116 --> 13:06.577
that I met… at the park.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.706
They're my park boys.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.126
If I ever did a heist,

13:14.835 --> 13:15.878
that's my crew.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.549
Two main reasons. Number one,
we've been balling for eight-plus years,

13:20.633 --> 13:23.302
and yet nobody knows anyone's last names.

13:25.012 --> 13:29.141
They barely know my first name.
My name is Sheng, they all call me Chang.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.227
[crowd laughs, applauds]

13:33.771 --> 13:37.608
Number two, we have a deep array
of backgrounds and skill sets.

13:37.691 --> 13:41.237
We have diverse role players
that you'd need to pull off a heist.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.199
We got a Black dude that works
in high-end residential lighting,

13:45.282 --> 13:47.493
so he has access
to all these rich celebrity houses

13:47.576 --> 13:48.786
throughout Los Angeles.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.456
We got a Salvadorian financial adviser
to help launder the loot,

13:52.540 --> 13:53.749
manage the money.

13:54.542 --> 13:58.504
We got a Mexican cop to run interference
if the law wants to get involved.

13:59.672 --> 14:03.300
We got another dude that's got
no technical skills, but he's white.

14:03.384 --> 14:06.804
[crowd laughs, applauds]

14:11.767 --> 14:14.687
He got powers I don't really understand
but, like…

14:16.146 --> 14:17.398
he on the team, man.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.234
We got to have diversity, folks.

14:24.572 --> 14:28.409
I can't play basketball
in my boxers anymore.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.744
I had to go back to wearing briefs.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.373
Because my body is going through changes.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.086
And I found out
that my balls are trying to leave.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.213
[crowd cheers, applauds]

14:41.297 --> 14:45.009
I've been too kind over the years.
I gave them too much freedom.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.094
Now they want independence.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.098
I can't have that.
I got to crush the rebellion.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.517
Shorten the leash.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.856
I know this because one day on the court,
in the middle of a play…

15:00.274 --> 15:01.942
my balls hit my inner thigh.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.280
And there was a loud clap.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.700
I got real shy.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.495
I was nervous, because I knew
what was gonna happen next.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.539
Somebody called foul.

15:17.791 --> 15:21.003
I had to explain,
"No, man, I'm the victim."

15:22.630 --> 15:24.006
"And the perpetrator."

15:25.215 --> 15:26.884
That's a "loose balls" foul.

15:26.967 --> 15:32.431
[crowd laughs, applauds]

15:32.514 --> 15:33.390
So…

15:34.850 --> 15:37.144
So I had to buy briefs, right?

15:37.227 --> 15:40.856
I have not bought briefs…
since middle school.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.943
It's been a long time. I was curious.
What's changed? What's new?

15:44.860 --> 15:47.237
I did some research,
I found some new briefs.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.114
No fly hole.

15:49.740 --> 15:52.785
I was intrigued. I don't use the fly hole.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.203
Usually, when I got to pee,

15:54.286 --> 15:56.497
it's too urgent for me
to thread the needle.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.167
I got to go straight to the urinal.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.878
I don't have time
to find a secret trapdoor.

16:09.343 --> 16:12.596
So I got them. I was excited.
I bought these new no-fly hole briefs.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.391
But then when I opened up the packaging,
I realized, man,

16:15.474 --> 16:17.226
I'm pretty sure I bought some panties.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.062
[laughs]

16:20.145 --> 16:23.607
What's the difference?
These are soft, black panties.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.777
That's not what I wanted.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.280
Yes, they fit. They are my size.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.200
They just too damn sexy.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.120
I don't know me like that.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.792
You know, the way they cut so low
over here, so high over there.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.336
How they wrap around my hip
and my inner thigh pit.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.672
I've never been held like this before.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.091
It's empowering, dude.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.927
When I put on those panties,
my posture got good real quick,

16:54.054 --> 16:56.140
And then involuntarily,
I started to undulate.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.766
I just started to, like…

16:58.434 --> 17:01.812
That's not my choice, that's the spirit
of the panty running through me.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.356
I'm just a vessel, dude.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.611
[crowd cheers]

17:13.824 --> 17:16.827
I think we should give ourselves
the best chance to be happy, man.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.330
And I feel like society as a whole,
we would all be better off

17:20.414 --> 17:26.253
if we were down to accept skipping
as an equal alternative to jogging.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.257
It'd be a better world, right?

17:30.841 --> 17:35.012
It's a shame we deny ourselves
such a quick and easy way to be joyful.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.141
How many miles you got to run
to get a runner's high?

17:40.309 --> 17:42.352
Nobody knows. It's too damn many.

17:43.353 --> 17:45.773
You start skipping right now,
you feel good right now.

17:46.815 --> 17:50.277
Imagine skipping
with three of your best homies.

17:53.322 --> 17:55.866
You shoulder to shoulder,
you in formation.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.452
You a gang of Glee.

17:59.828 --> 18:01.872
You looking good. You moving fast.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.916
It's efficient, man. It's efficient.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.586
I had a drink at the bar before the show.
It's about a ten-minute walk.

18:07.669 --> 18:08.754
Eight-minute skip.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.090
[crowd laughs, applauds]

18:11.673 --> 18:12.716
I got here early.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.306
I'm a little bit late
to the self-care game.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.101
I just started using

18:22.976 --> 18:24.770
enough body lotion.

18:25.854 --> 18:29.066
You know what I mean?
Really moisturize the whole body.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.318
It's a lot of lotion.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.823
I always cheated myself.
I didn't think I deserved that much.

18:36.990 --> 18:38.492
I gave myself a modest amount.

18:38.575 --> 18:42.121
Start lotioning from the top down,
so my legs paid the price.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.666
Then I joined Costco.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.045
Changed my life.
Costco lotion is a great value.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.047
Comes in a big old container.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.758
Usually has a convenient pump
on top, right?

18:54.842 --> 18:59.096
The only issue is about two-thirds
into the bottle, the technology collapses.

18:59.179 --> 19:00.973
[crowd laughs, applauds]

19:01.056 --> 19:04.977
Oh no! A lot of lotion left,
but you can't access it via the pump.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.270
The pump is dead.

19:07.312 --> 19:11.191
At that point, you got to unscrew the top
and use the pump like a dipstick.

19:14.862 --> 19:15.946
I don't like that.

19:17.823 --> 19:21.160
Going from pumping to dipping,
that's a humbling transition.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.455
Because when I'm pumping,
I feel carefree, I feel rich. I'm like…

19:26.248 --> 19:28.500
Boom, boom, boom, boom!

19:29.626 --> 19:30.711
Keep the change.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.796
[crowd laughs]

19:34.590 --> 19:36.341
When I'm dipping, it's like, "Oh."

19:41.346 --> 19:43.098
I'm an intelligent animal.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.353
I can use tools.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.904
You know, you got to twist and pull
at the same time.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.864
It's like buttering toast
with a chopstick.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.789
I got body lotion.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.835
Got face lotion. I stepped up my game.
I got eye cream.

20:12.419 --> 20:13.712
[crowd cheers]

20:13.795 --> 20:15.923
That's next level, you know?

20:16.006 --> 20:20.052
Eye cream is serious,
because eye cream costs more.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.848
More than any other lotion
you ever bought in your whole life.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.184
But it comes in the tiniest container.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.811
You have to justify
this precious purchase.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.272
You only apply the eye cream
with your ring finger.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.734
The softest finger, right?

20:35.817 --> 20:37.736
Because it's the laziest finger.

20:38.403 --> 20:41.490
Your ring finger, it don't pick,
it don't point, it don't cuss.

20:43.742 --> 20:44.618
It's…

20:45.535 --> 20:46.411
It's only…

20:46.495 --> 20:48.538
[crowd laughs, applauds]

20:48.622 --> 20:51.750
Your ring finger is only good for making
one promise, and eye cream…

20:53.669 --> 20:58.382
which you apply in a gentle dabbing motion
with your mouth slightly open, like…

20:59.091 --> 21:01.093
[crowd laughs, applauds]

21:05.222 --> 21:06.223
This better work.

21:08.558 --> 21:10.018
So expensive.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.110
I've been monitoring one wrinkle.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.862
I got one wrinkle coming in hot
over the last couple years.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.241
Right here, dude. Right here.
I can't stop it. I'm desperate.

21:24.324 --> 21:27.786
I try to bribe the wrinkle, like,
"That's eye cream, but I'll hook you up."

21:32.916 --> 21:35.377
That's special for you. Don't tell nobody.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.968
Then, of course,
there's trace amounts of eye cream left.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.512
You don't want to waste the trace amounts.

21:45.595 --> 21:49.725
So like a benevolent king, I'm like,
"Okay, everybody, eat up, you peasants."

21:49.808 --> 21:52.602
[crowd laughs]

22:02.904 --> 22:04.156
I sleep on my back.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.869
Sleep on my back. They say,
"Don't put your face against the pillows."

22:08.952 --> 22:10.662
"It makes your wrinkles worse."

22:10.746 --> 22:13.457
I sleep on my back,
but that's not my preferred position.

22:14.374 --> 22:17.085
On your back is so boring.
There's no snuggle.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.254
You just lay there like a vampire.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.884
Every now and then,
I'll still turn over, you know?

22:23.967 --> 22:26.136
Maybe I had a bad day.
Maybe it's my birthday.

22:27.387 --> 22:28.805
I want a treat.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.768
That's my new vice now.
I don't smoke cigarettes,

22:32.851 --> 22:36.355
but every now and then
I sleep on my tum-tum like a bad boy.

22:39.024 --> 22:43.487
Another kind of grown-up experience
I had recently, I took my, um…

22:44.696 --> 22:46.531
I took my girlfriend to get a mammogram.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.659
It's a regular screening
for breast cancer.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.995
It was her first one.
I didn't know much about it.

22:53.330 --> 22:56.958
When you get a mammogram,
what happens is they take your boob

22:57.042 --> 22:59.878
and they place it on a tortilla press,

23:01.963 --> 23:04.216
And then they smash it multiple times.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.636
It's brutal. I was surprised
this was the routine.

23:07.719 --> 23:11.348
I was like, "Are you a doctor
or are you making some titty paninis?"

23:11.431 --> 23:13.433
[crowd laughs]

23:17.187 --> 23:18.438
It's so painful.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.733
The first time they smashed
my girlfriend's boob, she farted.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.029
Everybody was surprised.

23:26.905 --> 23:30.409
She did what she had to do, you know?
She defended herself.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.328
Because she was attacked.

23:34.871 --> 23:37.707
She wasn't going down pleasantly, right?

23:37.791 --> 23:41.962
We all know about fight-or-flight,
but sometimes there's a third F option.

23:43.380 --> 23:46.591
They don't teach you that in school,
you learned that in the streets.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.098
When I heard

23:53.849 --> 23:54.808
the fart…

23:56.518 --> 23:58.770
immediately, I felt a lot of empathy.

23:59.438 --> 24:03.442
A lot of compassion for my girl,
because I knew how much it hurt her.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.570
I know her threshold for pain
is similar to mine,

24:06.653 --> 24:11.074
but I also know her fear
of farting in public is way higher.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.619
That's how much it hurt.

24:15.829 --> 24:16.913
That's too much, man.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.749
We at the doctor's office
trying to help somebody be healthy.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.668
It should not be that violent.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.838
That's not the way it is for guys.

24:24.921 --> 24:28.049
When they screen men, what do they do?
They touch your balls.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.011
They put a finger in your butt.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.140
That's pretty chill.

24:35.223 --> 24:37.684
[crowd laughs, applauds]

24:37.767 --> 24:40.061
Yeah, that's relatively tender, man.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.396
I don't mind.

24:42.647 --> 24:44.107
That's for my health.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.407
If I'm not mistaken,
I believe most guys in here,

24:52.491 --> 24:54.826
we already screen ourselves for fun.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.788
For funsies, for knowledge.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.541
Know thyself.

25:04.794 --> 25:07.756
My point is, it should be equally easy

25:08.381 --> 25:10.717
for everybody to get the care
that they need.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.512
It would not be the standard
if it was the other way around.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.223
Guys would not be okay
with such a procedure.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.100
Right? If they told me,
"We're gonna screen for cancer

25:19.184 --> 25:21.937
but we're gonna have to smash your balls
a few times."

25:23.730 --> 25:24.856
I'd be like, "Doc…"

25:25.941 --> 25:27.359
"I probably don't got it."

25:27.442 --> 25:29.236
[crowd laughs]

25:29.319 --> 25:30.362
[laughs]

25:30.445 --> 25:32.572
"I feel good, Doc. I feel loose."

25:34.699 --> 25:37.410
"I feel all right. We're good, man.
I'll see you next time."

25:43.208 --> 25:44.668
It's amazing, you know?

25:44.751 --> 25:47.712
The medicine that we have these days,
it's amazing.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.508
But how many more times
are we gonna have to read an article

25:51.591 --> 25:54.094
about how they found a new cure for cancer

25:54.761 --> 25:56.638
that only works on rats?

25:57.931 --> 25:59.641
Can we stop printing this article?

25:59.724 --> 26:03.311
Can we agree that does not belong
in the human newspaper?

26:04.312 --> 26:05.146
No, man.

26:05.772 --> 26:07.107
That's rat news.

26:10.151 --> 26:12.195
That's classic rat news.

26:13.363 --> 26:16.491
That's wonderful for the rat community.
Let them know.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.203
Let them know,
but keep us out of that conversation.

26:22.956 --> 26:26.418
I found out up to 99.6%
of all that research,

26:26.501 --> 26:28.461
it don't even transfer to humans.

26:29.045 --> 26:34.009
So we invest countless dollars,
hours developing all this medical know-how

26:34.092 --> 26:35.802
for the enemy.

26:37.554 --> 26:40.724
We're sitting on a lot of rat knowledge
right now.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.602
We can't even cure the common cold,

26:43.685 --> 26:46.688
but if you're a diabetic mouse
with eczema and gout,

26:48.356 --> 26:50.108
you ain't got nothing to worry about.

26:51.067 --> 26:53.612
You're gonna live a good life.
We got you. You a rat.

26:55.196 --> 26:57.240
It's a good time to be a rat, man.

26:58.491 --> 26:59.826
It's hard to be human.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.412
It's hard to be human,
specially in this country.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.873
Our healthcare system is dystopian.

27:05.540 --> 27:08.418
You know what I mean?
If you get hurt in America,

27:09.044 --> 27:11.713
you better make sure
you get hurt real bad.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.674
Bad enough to meet your deductible.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.094
Ideally in January…

27:20.722 --> 27:22.474
so you're covered for the year.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.477
That's the game. That's how you win.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.647
Don't get hurt in December.
That's for losers.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.732
[crowd laughs]

27:34.527 --> 27:37.364
There's only been one year,
one magical year in my life,

27:37.447 --> 27:39.157
where I've met my deductible.

27:40.075 --> 27:43.161
I was pumped, like, "Hell yeah,
I'm playing with house money now."

27:44.829 --> 27:46.831
It's time to make moves, you know?

27:46.915 --> 27:50.710
I saw a bunch of doctors.
I saw a specialist for some butt problems.

27:52.170 --> 27:55.924
By the time the appointment came around,
the issue had basically resolved itself.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.094
I did some research.
I was pretty sure I was okay.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.514
I still went to the appointment.
The doctor confirmed my research.

28:02.597 --> 28:04.557
He said, "Yeah, you're good,
but if you want

28:04.641 --> 28:05.892
I could take a closer look."

28:07.769 --> 28:09.187
This was not necessary.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.190
I already got the peace of mind
that I came for.

28:12.273 --> 28:14.067
But then I thought about my deductible.

28:15.276 --> 28:17.529
I thought about all the times
my insurance company

28:17.612 --> 28:19.406
left me hanging with the bill.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.574
And I was like, "You know what?"

28:22.701 --> 28:23.868
"Go get the jelly."

28:23.952 --> 28:25.954
[crowd laughs, applauds]

28:28.748 --> 28:29.666
Let's do it.

28:30.333 --> 28:35.296
Let's go. If I pay for the entrance fee,
then I'm gonna ride all the rides.

28:37.006 --> 28:39.926
Even the crappy ones.
I'm staying till we close.

28:40.009 --> 28:42.846
[crowd laughs, whistles]

28:42.929 --> 28:43.847
We did it.

28:44.723 --> 28:45.724
We did the thing.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.727
We learned nothing.

28:50.186 --> 28:51.604
It was not necessary.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.316
She went ahead and charged
the insurance company a big fee.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.818
I know she got hers.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.655
I did not get the satisfaction
I was looking for,

29:01.156 --> 29:05.076
because the road to economic justice
probably shouldn't go up your butt.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.164
It will not feel like winning

29:09.831 --> 29:12.834
when you land on your side
getting fingered by the doctor like,

29:12.917 --> 29:14.627
"Yeah, that's right, Blue Cross."

29:16.504 --> 29:17.964
That's called payback.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.011
Tsc.

29:23.803 --> 29:26.556
I'm always trying to beat the system.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.642
Even if it don't make sense.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.562
This is why I own a juicer

29:33.605 --> 29:34.689
that I don't use.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.068
Because at some point in your adult life…

29:40.653 --> 29:42.530
you gonna realize that you need nutrition.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.618
But you might not be committed
to eating nutritious food.

29:47.660 --> 29:50.872
You want to find a cheat code, a hack.
You discover green juice.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.750
You're like, if I drink juice
I can solve most of my problems.

29:53.833 --> 29:55.835
Then you buy juice at the store,
you're like,

29:55.919 --> 29:58.046
oh, juice is beyond my income level.

29:58.838 --> 30:00.632
Oh, I don't make juice money.

30:02.008 --> 30:04.761
That's a very stressful purchase, right?

30:04.844 --> 30:05.970
So you do the math.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.223
If I get my own juicer,
over the next 12 years,

30:08.306 --> 30:10.558
I can save me about a million dollars.

30:13.436 --> 30:14.646
That's a no-brainer,

30:14.729 --> 30:16.898
You tell your friends
about your brilliant plan,

30:16.981 --> 30:19.984
your friends offer you their juicers
they no longer use.

30:21.110 --> 30:23.905
You don't see the foreshadowing.
You reject the juicer.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.282
You say, "No, thank you.
That's not the right one."

30:27.367 --> 30:29.619
No wonder you stopped juicing.
I did the research.

30:29.702 --> 30:32.956
I'm getting the top-of-the-line mistake.

30:35.458 --> 30:39.212
So you drop like 400 bucks
on a cold press masticating juicer.

30:39.295 --> 30:42.006
You go to the farmer's market,
get the freshest ingredients.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.883
You know they're fresh,
'cause they're dirty.

30:45.593 --> 30:47.136
You like that quality, you know?

30:47.220 --> 30:49.347
There's no glossy fruit
at the farmer's market.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.723
It's a matte finish.

30:53.309 --> 30:57.021
You get your dusty harvest,
you go home, you scrub, you rinse,

30:57.522 --> 31:00.233
cut it up into little pieces,
juice it, clean the equipment,

31:00.316 --> 31:03.695
put that away, and an hour later
you're like, "That'll never happen again."

31:06.030 --> 31:08.449
No way, man. No way.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.286
It was fun. It was fun
to play Jamba Juice one time,

31:12.620 --> 31:14.038
but I'm retired now.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.124
I'm done.

31:16.207 --> 31:19.460
You know it's over for the juicer,
because I put it on top of the fridge

31:20.628 --> 31:22.672
with all that weird greasy dust.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.592
You know that dust?
That's that forever dust.

31:25.675 --> 31:28.803
That's not going nowhere.
That's gonna be oil one day.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.517
It feels bad. It feels bad.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.228
That's 400 bucks sitting on my fridge.
It feels bad.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.814
But I look at it as therapy in one shot.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.108
Now I'm cured.

31:42.692 --> 31:46.112
Now I buy juice at the store.
No problem, no stress.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.533
I'm like, "$10 a bottle?
Yeah, that's a good price."

31:51.743 --> 31:54.037
I've been on the front lines.
I know what it takes.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.289
Thank you for your service.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.335
[crowd applauds, cheers]

32:02.629 --> 32:05.840
I spend too much time and energy
on small decisions.

32:06.633 --> 32:10.053
You know? Like, I was at Popeyes
fried chicken, just having lunch.

32:10.136 --> 32:12.847
It's a treat for me,
so I'm trying to maximize.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.141
I'm evaluating every combo
that they offer.

32:15.224 --> 32:18.353
I'm trying to find the highest ratio
of satisfaction to cost.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.064
During my analysis,

32:22.398 --> 32:24.233
this dude walks in, no hesitation.

32:24.317 --> 32:26.986
He orders one breast,
two biscuits and a soda.

32:27.612 --> 32:29.364
This is not a combo at all.

32:31.157 --> 32:33.660
He saved no money on that order.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.120
I was in shock.

32:36.204 --> 32:39.248
I was like, "Dang, you up in Popeyes
ordering à la carte right now?"

32:41.668 --> 32:43.920
Man, I want to be that rich one day.

32:45.338 --> 32:49.217
That's my dream. One day I want to walk
into Popeyes and just start freestyling.

32:50.843 --> 32:52.929
Just off the top.
Don't even look at the menu.

32:53.012 --> 32:55.348
Just drop me a beat,
I'm gonna order from the heart.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.608
It's hard not to eat fast food
when you're touring.

33:06.359 --> 33:09.278
You know, like one night after the show,
I went back to my hotel.

33:09.362 --> 33:11.322
The only thing open was a Wendy's.

33:11.406 --> 33:14.158
It was across from the hotel,
but it was drive-thru only

33:14.242 --> 33:15.743
and I did not have a car.

33:16.661 --> 33:20.081
I had some money, I had some hope,
I had my legs.

33:21.165 --> 33:22.417
I skipped over there.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.795
I brought some good vibes.

33:25.878 --> 33:28.506
I knocked on the window.
I said, "Hey, we both showed up."

33:28.589 --> 33:29.966
"Let's do what we came to do."

33:31.634 --> 33:32.885
They were not excited.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.805
They said, "We can't serve you
on foot in the drive-thru."

33:35.888 --> 33:37.056
I said, "Why not?"

33:37.140 --> 33:39.308
They said,
"It's for your health and safety."

33:40.143 --> 33:42.478
I said, "I'm trying
to eat Wendy's right now."

33:45.231 --> 33:46.941
"Why are you bringing up that stuff?"

33:50.361 --> 33:53.114
They would not budge.
That would not serve me.

33:53.197 --> 33:56.534
Finally, I had to call an Uber
to take me around the building.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.369
I was precise.

33:58.453 --> 34:01.622
I was like, "Pick me up at the menu,
drop me off at the window."

34:03.541 --> 34:05.001
[laughs] "Is this your ride?"

34:05.918 --> 34:08.504
"I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna get you some nuggies."

34:10.882 --> 34:14.135
Recently, I was, uh, on tour.
I was in Canada.

34:14.218 --> 34:20.600
And in Canada, you can only buy alcohol
at certain government-run liquor stores.

34:20.683 --> 34:23.102
I didn't know this.
I was at the grocery store.

34:23.186 --> 34:27.440
I accidentally bought a six-pack
of non-alcoholic beer.

34:28.691 --> 34:32.070
I should have known something was off.
It was room temperature. A red flag.

34:33.946 --> 34:36.407
I went back to my condo.
I put five in the freezer.

34:36.491 --> 34:39.118
I put one in a bowl full of ice.
Got it real cold.

34:39.202 --> 34:42.538
Cracked it open, took a few sips.
I was like, "Oh, that's not refreshing."

34:44.373 --> 34:46.667
I looked at the can.
"That's not even alcohol."

34:48.419 --> 34:50.880
"This is basically bubbly barley juice."

34:52.757 --> 34:55.468
I was resigned. I was like,
"I guess I'm gonna have a sober night."

34:56.135 --> 34:57.678
"I guess it's bedtime soon."

34:58.387 --> 35:00.765
Next thing I knew, I finished the can.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.392
I drank the other five.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.437
I killed the whole six-pack.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.233
At which point, I realized,
"Man, I'm really out of control."

35:11.400 --> 35:14.237
"I'm also suffering
from non-alcoholism as well."

35:16.072 --> 35:18.866
That's bad, man. That's bad.
I'm not gonna make it.

35:18.950 --> 35:22.286
I'm gonna be the first guy
to lose his life to basic fluids.

35:27.458 --> 35:31.003
I have an addictive personality, you know?
I like to push it. I do.

35:31.629 --> 35:34.966
My tolerance for weed and alcohol
right now is way too high.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.467
I'm trying to bring it down.

35:36.551 --> 35:41.305
My friend recently told me
about a drug called DMT.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.724
It's a very powerful hallucinogenic

35:43.808 --> 35:47.186
that's supposed to give you
a sense of what death will be like.

35:48.437 --> 35:51.440
And I'm open-minded enough
to maybe try it once or twice.

35:51.524 --> 35:56.070
But I'm wary that I would never want
to develop a tolerance to DMT.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.906
Because what if one day
I just died naturally?

35:59.907 --> 36:02.702
Forty-five minutes later,
I'm like, "Bro, I'm not feeling it."

36:05.163 --> 36:07.582
"What's going on, man?
We gonna get dead or not?"

36:07.665 --> 36:09.458
"I can't just lay here all day."

36:10.918 --> 36:12.295
"This is weak stuff, man."

36:12.378 --> 36:14.922
Can you imagine being dead
and unimpressed?

36:19.635 --> 36:22.513
I'm grateful. I'm very grateful
for this journey, and stand-up.

36:23.306 --> 36:26.142
I spent a good amount of time,
uh, in New York City.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.604
Great place to elevate your skills
as a comedian,

36:29.687 --> 36:32.064
but a tougher place to exist for sure.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.649
When I first moved to New York,

36:33.733 --> 36:37.361
I didn't know how every time
you renew your lease in New York City,

36:37.445 --> 36:39.655
the rent has to go up, every time.

36:40.489 --> 36:41.991
I didn't know that. I've lived around.

36:42.074 --> 36:45.411
In most other cities,
the landlords give you a few years

36:45.494 --> 36:47.872
to step up your life.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.542
That's reasonable.

36:52.084 --> 36:55.546
New York City landlords like,
"You got one year to get 10% better."

36:57.590 --> 36:58.841
"You'd better hurry."

37:00.718 --> 37:02.511
Ten percent, man. That's a lot.

37:03.262 --> 37:04.096
Every year.

37:04.180 --> 37:07.099
That's a big return every year.
That's a lot of pressure.

37:07.183 --> 37:09.477
My parents never gave me
that kind of pressure.

37:10.061 --> 37:14.023
I felt like I was in New York City
trying to make my landlord proud.

37:15.608 --> 37:19.070
It was weird. I felt like my dream was
to buy my landlord a house.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.241
I want that for him, you know?
Because he pushed me.

37:23.324 --> 37:26.827
He believed in me.
He chose me for unit 16.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.254
It's an up-and-down business.
It's a very up-and-down business.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.215
I remember one time, I was so excited.

37:39.298 --> 37:42.093
I got an offer for a show in Boston.

37:43.844 --> 37:44.762
I was pumped.

37:45.638 --> 37:48.557
They were gonna pay me
and cover my transportation.

37:48.641 --> 37:51.394
I got the confirmation for the train
from New York to Boston.

37:51.477 --> 37:53.729
Turns out, that ticket cost more

37:54.397 --> 37:55.815
than my performance fee.

37:57.024 --> 37:58.276
I got bummed out.

37:58.776 --> 38:01.487
Started having some dark thoughts.
I was like, "Dang."

38:02.613 --> 38:04.365
"Maybe I should just be a train."

38:04.448 --> 38:06.450
[crowd laughs]

38:08.661 --> 38:11.289
"Maybe that's what I got to do
to make it."

38:15.584 --> 38:17.795
"I know my nephew will be pumped
to see me."

38:19.422 --> 38:22.216
"Hell, yeah,
I'll be uncle of the year forever."

38:23.426 --> 38:26.345
I mean, partly why I do this
is to inspire people like my nephew

38:26.429 --> 38:27.847
to follow their dreams.

38:27.930 --> 38:30.391
And an Asian American comedian,
that's pretty exciting.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.519
But to be the first Asian American
choo-choo train?

38:33.602 --> 38:35.604
[crowd laughs]

38:35.688 --> 38:37.148
That's trailblazing.

38:41.652 --> 38:45.364
I love this life. I do. I appreciate it.
But, you know, sometimes I miss…

38:46.907 --> 38:48.367
the stability of my old job.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.328
I used to work in an office, you know?

38:50.411 --> 38:53.122
The best part about any office job
is the fact that

38:53.789 --> 38:54.832
you can print.

38:57.251 --> 38:59.462
You print whatever you got to print, man.

39:00.546 --> 39:03.632
That's why I went to work,
so I could get paid.

39:03.716 --> 39:07.386
I get health care and I print stuff
for me and my loved ones.

39:09.388 --> 39:12.266
I know you got a printer at home.
We all got a printer at home.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.477
That's for emergency use only.

39:16.437 --> 39:19.523
The printer at home right now,
that printer is currently unplugged.

39:20.524 --> 39:21.609
It's dusty.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.527
It only has cyan.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.366
All your documents come out blue.
"Oh, you an architect?"

39:33.454 --> 39:36.248
At home I'm mean to myself, man. I'm mean.

39:36.332 --> 39:39.210
I'm always talking myself out
of printing stuff. I'm like, "No, no, no."

39:40.419 --> 39:41.962
"You gonna memorize that."

39:46.634 --> 39:49.345
If I have to print at home I'm like,
we'll select the pages.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.806
There's no "print all."
"Print all" is for work.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.683
At home, we select pages.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.519
Double-sided.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.521
Gray scale.

39:59.146 --> 40:02.566
Lightest setting possible.
When it comes out, it better be invisible.

40:07.822 --> 40:11.951
That's why it's fun when you go to work.
At work you print fast, loose.

40:12.952 --> 40:15.788
You show up trigger-happy,
you ready to control-P all day.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.959
You might not make the money
to live the life you dream,

40:20.042 --> 40:22.420
but you can certainly print like you do.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.714
At work, it's all about being wasteful

40:26.757 --> 40:28.008
with no remorse.

40:28.759 --> 40:31.053
You don't feel a thing.
You don't feel a thing.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.891
Have you ever thrown away documents…
that you just printed?

40:37.852 --> 40:40.729
You just clicked "print all,"
it just came out.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.481
It's a fresh little stack.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.234
Have you ever thrown away

40:46.026 --> 40:47.194
warm paper?

40:47.278 --> 40:50.239
[crowd laughs]

40:50.322 --> 40:51.490
It feels wrong.

40:52.533 --> 40:56.203
Maybe you should wait for it to cool down
before you throw it in the garbage.

40:56.787 --> 40:59.165
It just got here.
Let it live a little bit.

41:01.500 --> 41:02.585
But you don't hesitate,

41:02.668 --> 41:04.920
because that office life
made you a gangster.

41:10.843 --> 41:11.927
It's weird, right?

41:12.011 --> 41:15.806
It's weird. They try to control you
in so many ways at work.

41:17.141 --> 41:19.101
But they let you print free rein.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.103
Ain't that suspicious?

41:21.645 --> 41:22.730
Because they know

41:23.272 --> 41:25.149
they got to leave us something to turn to

41:25.232 --> 41:27.443
when we feel like we have no control.

41:28.694 --> 41:30.237
They can't take away printing.

41:30.321 --> 41:32.781
Printing is the only thing
stopping the revolution.

41:34.617 --> 41:38.037
When they say stuff like,
"Come in Friday after Thanksgiving,"

41:38.120 --> 41:39.622
that's when I'm like, "Oh, okay."

41:40.748 --> 41:44.126
"Okay, I guess it's time for me
to self-publish my Gmail account."

41:47.004 --> 41:50.132
"I guess it's time for me
to back it all up on paper."

41:51.634 --> 41:54.470
"People use the cloud,
I'm gonna use trees."

41:57.848 --> 41:59.475
Full disclosure, everybody.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.686
I got a reversible belt.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.149
It's supposed to be a secret.
I got one belt.

42:07.233 --> 42:08.692
My coworker thought I had two.

42:11.487 --> 42:13.447
If you don't know
what a reversible belt is,

42:13.531 --> 42:16.784
it's one belt, but it's black on one side,
it's brown on the other side,

42:16.867 --> 42:18.452
has a buckle that swivels.

42:18.953 --> 42:21.956
So you can wear your choice
of your brown dress shoes

42:22.039 --> 42:23.582
or your black dress shoes.

42:23.666 --> 42:26.919
Adjust the buckle accordingly.
You match, people notice.

42:27.002 --> 42:29.004
And that's how you get ahead in life.

42:32.258 --> 42:35.553
The reversible belt's
for a very specific period in your life

42:35.636 --> 42:38.222
when you're fancy enough
to own two pairs of dress shoes,

42:38.305 --> 42:40.182
but you're not quite ready for two belts.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.813
It's a transitional period.
You will get there one day.

42:45.896 --> 42:48.023
One day, you're gonna make
that two-belt money.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.401
But for now, you're gonna swivel.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.615
Tsc. I'm…

42:57.533 --> 42:58.617
I'm a godfather.

42:59.743 --> 43:02.037
My friend made me the godfather
of her daughters.

43:02.121 --> 43:05.624
Made my girlfriend the godmother.
Now we got to stay together for the kids.

43:05.708 --> 43:10.045
[crowd laughs, applauds]

43:11.755 --> 43:15.426
When your friends start having children,
when your friends start having kids,

43:15.509 --> 43:16.885
you'd better be ready.

43:17.928 --> 43:21.890
You'd better be ready
to read out loud again.

43:25.769 --> 43:28.397
Do not assume that you can just do it.

43:32.651 --> 43:35.654
I'm sure you can read.
That's not the issue.

43:35.738 --> 43:37.323
The issue is,

43:37.406 --> 43:38.574
can you act?

43:40.743 --> 43:43.662
Can you improvise voices
for different characters?

43:44.580 --> 43:47.875
Can you sing? Can you dance?
Can you maintain confidence in yourself

43:47.958 --> 43:50.169
as you put on a whole production
for an audience

43:50.252 --> 43:51.837
that gives you no feedback?

43:57.259 --> 44:00.012
I went to my friend's house.
I thought we were gonna have dinner.

44:00.095 --> 44:01.847
At one point, they put the baby down.

44:01.930 --> 44:04.099
They said, "You want to read to the baby?"

44:04.183 --> 44:05.392
I said, uh…

44:05.476 --> 44:07.353
"Are y'all gonna be listening too?"

44:09.688 --> 44:11.273
Who is this exercise for?

44:15.986 --> 44:18.322
They gave me a book called Dimity Duck.

44:18.947 --> 44:21.659
I've never read this book.
I jumped in confidently.

44:21.742 --> 44:23.035
I was like, "Dimity Duck."

44:23.744 --> 44:26.789
"Dimity Duck waddles,
she toddles and she sings."

44:26.872 --> 44:30.334
"Wiggle waggle goes her tail,
and whoosh goes her wings."

44:31.460 --> 44:35.839
And the whole time I'm reading this book,
I'm trying so hard to not sound like E-40.

44:38.550 --> 44:39.927
But I really wanted to.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.596
Because I was like,
"These rhymes are fire!"

44:44.098 --> 44:46.308
"I want to honor the lyrics."

44:47.309 --> 44:49.019
"She toddles and she sings."

44:49.103 --> 44:51.689
"Wiggle waggle goes her tail,
and whoosh goes her wings."

44:52.773 --> 44:54.274
Uh…

44:55.150 --> 44:59.405
[crowd cheers, applauds]

45:05.494 --> 45:07.246
I think it's very precious, you know?

45:07.329 --> 45:09.498
The time you spend
with these kids is precious,

45:09.581 --> 45:12.209
because they will reveal to you truths

45:12.292 --> 45:15.504
about yourself that nobody in your life
dare tell you.

45:18.006 --> 45:20.008
One day, my goddaughter said to me,
she said,

45:20.718 --> 45:21.969
"Uncle Sheng,

45:22.052 --> 45:24.888
your teeth are yellow
and your elbows are gray."

45:31.645 --> 45:33.313
I was like, "Good morning."

45:38.527 --> 45:40.821
I was like,
"We learned enough colors this month."

45:40.904 --> 45:43.240
"I think you good. You good on colors."

45:43.741 --> 45:48.287
"I think it's time for us to move on
to how to deliver news with sensitivity."

45:54.168 --> 45:55.544
One time my nephew said to me,

45:55.627 --> 45:58.338
"Uncle Sheng,
your breath smells like birds."

46:01.425 --> 46:04.011
That's locked into my brain.
It will not leave.

46:05.721 --> 46:08.849
The kid can vote now. It's been 15 years.

46:10.225 --> 46:12.770
It hurt more that it made no sense.

46:14.855 --> 46:16.482
It's poetically abstract.

46:17.816 --> 46:22.279
I felt like my breath was so bad,
I pushed this child to discover metaphors.

46:29.703 --> 46:33.582
It's hard when kids are mean.
It's very hard to accept.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.919
You know? Because they're so young.

46:37.002 --> 46:38.086
They're so innocent.

46:38.170 --> 46:41.507
They're not indoctrinated by religion,
racism or politics.

46:41.590 --> 46:44.468
Like, it's a very pure hate.

46:46.220 --> 46:47.888
It's clean. You deserve it.

46:47.971 --> 46:50.057
Because they came from God to you.

46:55.229 --> 46:57.022
One time, I was at a wedding party.

46:58.148 --> 46:59.525
Having a good time.

46:59.608 --> 47:02.069
My friend introduced me to her niece,
this little girl.

47:02.152 --> 47:03.737
An aspiring comedian.

47:04.404 --> 47:09.076
They said, "Hey, can you perform for her?"
I said, "No, man. We at a wedding party."

47:09.535 --> 47:12.454
"This is not the appropriate context
or audience."

47:12.538 --> 47:13.914
"I'm not gonna do it."

47:14.414 --> 47:17.751
This little girl said,
"You not funny, and you a fraud."

47:22.589 --> 47:23.590
It got to me.

47:25.133 --> 47:28.470
It cut deep. It affected my night.
I could not shake it.

47:29.763 --> 47:32.891
Have you ever had a kid be so mean to you,

47:32.975 --> 47:34.434
you start to go crazy?

47:35.978 --> 47:38.772
You start to think of ways
to legally retaliate.

47:41.775 --> 47:45.654
I was thinking long game. I was like,
"Girl, I'm gonna get you eventually."

47:47.030 --> 47:49.700
"Yeah. Maybe I'm gonna stop recycling."

47:56.832 --> 48:00.085
"Maybe I'm gonna lean
into climate change."

48:01.378 --> 48:03.005
"I hope you like it hot!"

48:10.929 --> 48:12.973
I'm not good with negative energy.

48:13.056 --> 48:15.893
That's not where I want to be, man.

48:16.977 --> 48:21.064
The last time I lost my temper,
the last time I really, really lost it,

48:21.148 --> 48:23.233
in a fit of rage,

48:24.443 --> 48:27.404
I threw some earplugs across a hotel room.

48:29.948 --> 48:31.408
If you know anything

48:32.326 --> 48:33.452
about anger

48:34.202 --> 48:35.203
or physics,

48:37.039 --> 48:37.998
you know

48:38.498 --> 48:40.083
there's no satisfaction

48:40.751 --> 48:42.586
in throwing foam.

48:45.505 --> 48:46.757
You release no tension.

48:46.840 --> 48:50.427
You just confirm that you are angry
and you are so stupid right now.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.891
It was a family vacation.

48:56.475 --> 48:59.478
I was sharing a hotel room with my dad.
I knew he snored.

49:00.562 --> 49:02.356
I brought my earplugs. I was prepared.

49:02.439 --> 49:04.816
But one night I woke up,
one earplug with missing.

49:05.901 --> 49:08.278
I looked all around. I couldn't find it.

49:08.362 --> 49:10.530
I was like, one alone is useless.

49:10.614 --> 49:13.909
And out of frustration,
I chucked it into the darkness.

49:15.327 --> 49:19.122
I crawled back into bed,
I found the other earplug in the sheets.

49:24.920 --> 49:27.881
I was like, that's not helpful now.
I threw that somewhere.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.971
I laid down. I did not sleep.

49:35.222 --> 49:38.600
And after a long, long while,
finally I woke up my dad.

49:38.684 --> 49:41.103
And in that moment
is this very challenging situation,

49:41.186 --> 49:45.273
because you have to explain to somebody
who was just completely unconscious

49:46.274 --> 49:49.820
that, actually, they've been an asshole
for three hours.

49:52.030 --> 49:54.408
They don't get it.
They think they are innocent.

49:54.491 --> 49:57.202
They believe with their whole heart
that they are innocent.

49:57.786 --> 50:02.249
In fact, they try to gaslight you.
They look at you like you're the monster.

50:04.543 --> 50:06.336
My dad was like, "What's your problem?"

50:06.420 --> 50:09.381
I was like,
"It's weird that you don't know."

50:12.092 --> 50:15.095
"But it's okay, because I recorded you.
I got a three-hour--"

50:15.887 --> 50:20.058
"I got a three-hour mini docuseries of you

50:20.142 --> 50:21.768
dying out loud."

50:24.521 --> 50:27.315
"And in the very last second,
you choose life again."

50:27.399 --> 50:28.817
"You came back to us."

50:29.735 --> 50:31.194
"You did that over and over."

50:31.278 --> 50:34.406
"You choked yourself,
then you saved yourself again and again."

50:37.409 --> 50:38.702
It's pure terror.

50:39.953 --> 50:41.705
I'm an innocent bystander.

50:42.748 --> 50:45.167
The first hour, I'm scared. I'm concerned.

50:46.251 --> 50:49.671
Every now and then,
the snoring stops. There's relief.

50:50.672 --> 50:53.383
And then there's also,
"But is he dead, though?"

50:56.762 --> 51:01.391
The second hour I'm like, life or death.
Please pick one, let us move forward.

51:03.351 --> 51:05.520
The third hour, I spent researching.

51:07.147 --> 51:08.440
"Deviated septums."

51:10.233 --> 51:11.359
"CPAP machines."

51:12.819 --> 51:15.655
And I just contemplated.
I just thought about it, you know?

51:15.739 --> 51:17.699
"How did snoring

51:17.783 --> 51:19.659
survive evolution?"

51:21.453 --> 51:22.579
That don't make sense.

51:23.163 --> 51:25.957
Biologically, I'm not sure
you're supposed to be here anymore.

51:26.041 --> 51:28.001
I don't think you belong in the gene pool.

51:29.044 --> 51:32.214
That's not a trait fit for survival.

51:33.423 --> 51:35.050
You unconscious!

51:36.051 --> 51:37.677
And you loud.

51:40.597 --> 51:42.349
You the perfect prey.

51:44.601 --> 51:50.023
You should have been eaten in your sleep
a long time ago by a saber-toothed tiger.

51:51.983 --> 51:54.778
You out here giving away
everybody's location.

52:03.120 --> 52:05.455
Have you ever tried
to copy somebody's snoring?

52:06.748 --> 52:07.999
With an agenda, right?

52:08.083 --> 52:10.585
Because the next morning,
even at full volume,

52:10.669 --> 52:13.421
your recording didn't quite capture
what you thought had happened.

52:15.423 --> 52:18.552
You say, "Never mind the recording.
I'm gonna do it live."

52:19.636 --> 52:22.097
"I'm gonna show you what you did to me."

52:23.348 --> 52:27.102
You try to snore at them
as hard as you can.

52:27.185 --> 52:30.147
But after two seconds,
it starts to hurt real bad.

52:31.356 --> 52:32.691
You can't sustain it.

52:33.316 --> 52:36.153
That's when you realize,
it's kind of an evil superpower.

52:37.154 --> 52:40.949
It's kind of a dark miracle
that somebody can snore all night,

52:41.950 --> 52:43.368
wake up rested.

52:45.787 --> 52:48.123
And they just walk away unscathed.

52:50.292 --> 52:53.128
It feels like
there should be blood everywhere.

52:59.968 --> 53:02.429
Despite the snoring drama, you know,

53:03.221 --> 53:06.099
generally I am connecting
with my parents more.

53:06.808 --> 53:08.894
And one thing we bond over, surprisingly,

53:09.519 --> 53:10.478
is fruit.

53:11.980 --> 53:14.858
Grown Asian people love fruit, dude.

53:16.234 --> 53:17.485
You better know this.

53:18.236 --> 53:22.199
If you try and date an older Asian person,
you better know what's in season now.

53:23.283 --> 53:26.286
You better know
what's sweet and juicy right now.

53:28.205 --> 53:31.166
Every Asian American
has a childhood memory of their parents

53:31.249 --> 53:34.794
sending them on a mission to go
steal fruit from the neighbor's yard.

53:37.088 --> 53:40.342
I cherish that memory.
I knew it was shady, but it was fun.

53:41.343 --> 53:43.470
You know? And also, I understand.

53:43.553 --> 53:46.640
You know, my parents are immigrants
from Taiwan.

53:46.723 --> 53:50.310
They grew up poor.
As kids, they had very little.

53:50.852 --> 53:54.147
As a kid, my mom had no interest
in her own birthday,

53:54.231 --> 53:57.651
because the only thing they gave her
was one chicken egg.

53:58.944 --> 54:00.654
My childhood was very different.

54:00.737 --> 54:05.533
My birthdays would include cake, gifts.
My best friend would sleep over.

54:05.617 --> 54:08.119
At night, we'd go out
and throw eggs at people's houses.

54:09.955 --> 54:13.375
It's pretty crazy to think about
how far we've come in one generation.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.379
That's a pretty big leap forward
from a one-egg birthday party,

54:17.462 --> 54:19.714
to the life of privilege
that I've gotten to live.

54:21.007 --> 54:22.384
It's incredible, you know?

54:22.467 --> 54:25.262
I'm absolutely grateful
that my parents immigrated,

54:25.345 --> 54:27.013
but as grateful as I am,

54:27.597 --> 54:30.475
I don't know
if I would ever do that for my kids.

54:33.603 --> 54:36.106
That's a lot of inconvenience.

54:37.023 --> 54:39.943
That's a lot of suffering
and sacrifice, right?

54:40.026 --> 54:41.111
Can you imagine…

54:42.445 --> 54:44.072
leaving home?

54:44.864 --> 54:47.200
You really think about
what that means to leave

54:48.076 --> 54:49.369
your home.

54:51.246 --> 54:54.040
You leave your family,
your friends, your community.

54:54.124 --> 54:56.376
You leave everything
that you are familiar with.

54:56.459 --> 54:59.879
You move to a completely foreign country
where you don't speak the language,

54:59.963 --> 55:02.757
just so your offspring
have more opportunities.

55:04.426 --> 55:07.012
And then your kid goes into
stand-up comedy.

55:11.224 --> 55:12.600
That's devastating.

55:15.020 --> 55:18.815
They had no idea this was a risk.

55:20.567 --> 55:23.069
When they were deciding,
"Should we stay? Should we go?"

55:23.153 --> 55:26.698
They had no clue
he might find a brand-new way to struggle.

55:29.909 --> 55:32.495
You provide everything
one needs to succeed.

55:32.579 --> 55:35.749
He might choose to have a hard life
on purpose.

55:38.209 --> 55:41.296
They put me through college.
I got a business degree.

55:41.379 --> 55:45.633
I played with their hopes and dreams
all the way up until graduation.

55:46.551 --> 55:48.678
And then I was like, "Psych!"

55:51.222 --> 55:52.599
"I got jokes, Mom."

55:52.682 --> 55:55.894
[crowd laughs, applauds]

56:07.989 --> 56:10.784
My mom don't even know
what stand-up comedy is.

56:11.368 --> 56:14.287
She tells her friends
I'm like a clown with words.

56:20.835 --> 56:23.546
But they're proud of me.
My folks are proud of me.

56:23.630 --> 56:25.715
I assume. They haven't said it yet.

56:27.342 --> 56:31.513
My folks are proud of me
because I'm kind of tall.

56:33.890 --> 56:37.185
Immigrant parents love tall children.

56:38.061 --> 56:39.771
It's their favorite.

56:39.854 --> 56:41.648
They see that as progress.

56:41.731 --> 56:44.526
They see that as affirmation
of their life choices.

56:44.609 --> 56:49.072
They see that as an indication
the kid got nutrients they never got.

56:50.323 --> 56:52.867
Now the kid can steal fruit
from a little bit higher.

56:58.790 --> 56:59.624
I'm grateful.

56:59.707 --> 57:01.793
I want to make them proud, you know? I do.

57:03.336 --> 57:05.547
It's tough in this business.
I try to push ahead.

57:05.630 --> 57:09.050
I try to do things I assume grown-ups
are supposed to be doing, you know?

57:09.134 --> 57:12.220
Like recently, I started researching
this thing people call

57:12.846 --> 57:15.640
"real estates."

57:17.809 --> 57:19.811
Right? Because I saved
a little bit of money,

57:19.894 --> 57:22.021
and was led to believe perhaps it's time

57:22.105 --> 57:24.607
for me to think about
buying a house in Los Angeles.

57:24.691 --> 57:26.276
Maybe that's within my reach.

57:26.359 --> 57:28.445
So I looked into it,
turns out that, actually,

57:28.528 --> 57:30.530
I got to borrow a million dollars.

57:32.157 --> 57:33.950
I'm new and naive to the whole business,

57:34.033 --> 57:37.704
but if I have to borrow a million dollars
to buy a house, it feels like…

57:38.621 --> 57:39.998
I can't buy a house.

57:43.460 --> 57:46.671
My agent was like, "No big deal.
We're going to get you a mortgage."

57:46.754 --> 57:48.923
So I was like, okay,
I'll put in an application

57:49.007 --> 57:51.342
for what's called a jumbo loan.

57:51.426 --> 57:52.635
That's the technical term.

57:52.719 --> 57:56.097
On the application
it's written J-U-M-B-O, "Jumbo."

57:57.599 --> 57:59.058
We all know it's too much money

57:59.142 --> 58:02.270
when you got business people
using cartoon words.

58:05.482 --> 58:09.694
If you want to qualify for a jumbo,
your down payment got to be bonkers.

58:17.619 --> 58:19.746
The crazy thing was, somebody approved it.

58:20.914 --> 58:23.875
I got approved for a jumbo unexpectedly.
I was in shock.

58:23.958 --> 58:25.210
When I saw that I was like…

58:29.214 --> 58:30.840
They think I'm good for it.

58:31.549 --> 58:35.220
They think I'm good for one million,
plus 900,000 in interest.

58:35.303 --> 58:39.682
That's two million dollars they expect
me to provide them over my lifetime.

58:40.975 --> 58:42.977
They know something I don't know.

58:44.938 --> 58:46.523
That's encouraging, you know?

58:46.606 --> 58:48.566
I'm not gonna buy a house,
but as a comedian

58:48.650 --> 58:51.069
you know I love getting approval
from strangers.

58:54.239 --> 58:55.698
I'm always curious,

58:55.782 --> 58:57.492
who was that loan officer?

58:58.493 --> 59:01.538
Who was that person working at the bank
reviewing the applications,

59:01.621 --> 59:04.457
like, "Sheng Wang is a 42-year-old
Taiwanese American

59:04.541 --> 59:07.126
trying to make it as a stand-up comedian."

59:09.420 --> 59:10.755
That's a bad bet.

59:12.507 --> 59:13.925
But we gonna play today.

59:16.427 --> 59:18.596
I'm Sheng Wang.
Thank you all so very much!

59:18.680 --> 59:21.391
-[crowd cheers]

59:22.308 --> 59:23.560
Thank you, everybody.

59:24.435 --> 59:25.353
Appreciate you.

59:26.062 --> 59:28.314
Be well. Love y'all.

59:28.898 --> 59:29.857
Take care.
