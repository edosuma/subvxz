00:01.961 --> 00:03.754
[boy] I tried to reach
for the stars,

00:03.754 --> 00:07.758
but now I'm alone,
and lost.

00:07.758 --> 00:10.552
I wish I had never left my
friends at the orphanage.

00:10.552 --> 00:13.973
Oh, that was very,
very good sweetie.

00:13.973 --> 00:16.183
I got chills,
I think he's perfect.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.769
Are you guys kidding?
Are you kidding?

00:18.769 --> 00:21.313
Mr. Duncan, we're right in
the middle of auditions.

00:21.313 --> 00:23.607
We're selling tickets to this,
people are expecting talent.

00:23.607 --> 00:26.025
[Dwyer] Mr. Duncan,
it's for the kids.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.487
-[Gerry] Give me your hand.
-[Dwyer] We don't got time
for this right now.

00:28.487 --> 00:32.157
Oh wait, I think I would
like to see this actually.

00:32.157 --> 00:34.743
Stand there, watch.
I'll show you how to act.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.328
[clears throat]

00:36.328 --> 00:38.831
What? This can't be a circus.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.749
There's nobody here.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.168
I tried to reach for the stars,

00:43.168 --> 00:46.547
but now I'm alone and lost,
like a leaf.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.590
Blowing.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.260
I should have never
left that orphanage.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.513
[laughs] Thanks for coming,
that was fun.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.683
That's the commitment you
need to give

00:57.683 --> 00:59.309
and you guys
need to watch for.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.812
See the emotion, the passion,

01:01.812 --> 01:03.981
the head down when I did it.
The hands...

01:03.981 --> 01:06.567
The feel of me doing it real.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.861
We really gotta move
on Mr. Duncan.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.154
I should be in this play.
I should be in this.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.740
I think we're
going to go with Ron.

01:12.740 --> 01:14.825
You're gonna go with Ron?
Ron the wooden...

01:16.410 --> 01:18.871
That? You're gonna go with that?

01:18.871 --> 01:21.540
That's gonna be fun to watch.
"I'm a leaf."

01:21.540 --> 01:23.083
-Like, come on.
-[Trudy] Yeah, listen,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.753
that leaf isn't
the only thing
that blows,

01:25.753 --> 01:29.006
-by the way, Gerry.
-That's not funny Trudy.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.299
We're all just trying
to do our best here.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.764
♪ I'm awesome
No you're not dude, don't lie ♪

01:36.764 --> 01:39.516
♪ I'm awesome
I'm driving around
in my mom's ride ♪

01:39.516 --> 01:42.561

01:44.396 --> 01:47.190

01:47.190 --> 01:50.069
Hey, are you still
in World Religions?

01:50.069 --> 01:53.822
-I finished that unit weeks ago.
-Teaching's not a race.

01:53.822 --> 01:57.200
Uh-huh, it's a pretty hard
subject to teach. Really tough.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.954
No it's not, because God
created everything. Simple.

01:59.954 --> 02:02.414
Callaghan is actually really
strict about not letting

02:02.414 --> 02:04.083
personal beliefs get in the way.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.085
Well, I never let my own
personal beliefs get in the way

02:06.085 --> 02:07.836
because I am professional.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.213
Which is why I've never said
anything about your...

02:11.339 --> 02:13.842
...nose... and... lips.

02:15.052 --> 02:17.471
Thanks.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.225
Big day tomorrow.
Big five-eight. Huh?

02:22.225 --> 02:25.896
What a coincidence, it's
Callaghan's 58th birthday too.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.607
[laughing] Burn.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.985
Good one. Did you get
him a present yet?

02:30.985 --> 02:32.736
-Yup!
-Nothing fancy though right?

02:32.736 --> 02:35.572
-Nope.
-'Cause that's what he said.
Nothing fancy.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.992
So, I think for
his birthday, we should just get
what he wants for his birthday.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.494
Which is nothing fancy.
'Cause that's what I got him.
Is that what you got him?

02:40.494 --> 02:44.081
-Trudy? Trudy? Trudy!
-Robert, will you relax?

02:44.081 --> 02:46.834
-I am relaxed.
-I kept it small.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.376
So you don't
need to be intimidated.

02:48.376 --> 02:50.629
Good! Nothing fancy.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.803
Religions of the world.

02:57.803 --> 03:03.266
Christianity, Catholic,
Muslim and Jew.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.396
-Yes, Maya?
-Sir, I'm pretty sure there's
more than three religions.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.941
-Would you like to teach this?
-Will I get paid what
you get paid?

03:10.941 --> 03:14.153
No, 'cause you can go to
university for seven years
to learn this.

03:14.153 --> 03:16.571
And be trained as a teacher.
Thank you.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.740
Now, if the Pope here would
let me finish.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.451
Yes, there are other religions
of the world.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.829
But they are silly,
or created by crazy people.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.914
So we don't talk about them
or believe in them.

03:25.914 --> 03:31.461
Your job this unit is to do
a presentation on a religion.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.588
I am suggesting the first one.

03:33.588 --> 03:37.092
Specifically Catholicism, which
is a branch of Christianity.

03:37.092 --> 03:40.387
Because that's the most popular
and the biggest. How popular?

03:40.387 --> 03:45.266
Jesus was Jewish and even he
was Catholic. Think about that.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.186
-Sir?
-Yes.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.770
Is it all right if I do my
presentation on atheism?

03:48.770 --> 03:50.731
Atheism? No!
That's nothing!

03:50.731 --> 03:52.649
Are you gonna do a presentation
on nothing, Lewis?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.609
Sir, I'm an atheist.
It's what I believe.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.028
Okay, that's what you believe?

03:56.028 --> 03:57.320
Then you do your presentation
on nothing.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.614
Your mark will be nothing.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.200
And you will go to hell.
I promise.

04:01.200 --> 04:03.911
Okay, so let's dig into
the text books,

04:03.911 --> 04:06.538
start looking at the
religions, and pick the one

04:06.538 --> 04:09.750
that you think you want to
present on, let's go.

04:14.379 --> 04:17.465
'Cause I believe in God,
Father Almighty.

04:17.465 --> 04:19.676
Creator of heaven and earth.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.846
-I believe in Jesus Christ.
-Sir.

04:22.846 --> 04:26.558
His only son, our Lord was
born to the virgin Mary.

04:26.558 --> 04:29.603
He suffered under
Pontius Pilate.

04:29.603 --> 04:33.356
Was crucified,
died and was buried.

04:33.356 --> 04:37.402
He ascended to the dead and
on the third day he rose again.

04:37.402 --> 04:42.282
You get more, Lewis.
And you get a little extra too.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.619
That's what I'm talking about.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.662
-[woman] Um, excuse me.
-Yes?

04:47.662 --> 04:50.624
Can you tell me where the
main office is?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.375
Office?

04:52.375 --> 04:54.544
Sure, sorry, uh, right
down there to the right.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.005
-Are you a sub?
-Yeah, I'm Danni Burlon.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.424
Hi... Danni.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.968
-Hello.
-Hi.

05:00.968 --> 05:05.055
I'm Simon. If you need
anything please let me know.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.016
-Thanks, Simon.
-I'm Simon.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.606
-Thanks, guys.
-Okay, Danni.

05:17.567 --> 05:20.612
Cheese and crackers.
I call dibs.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.615
Dibs? Simon, Danni is a guy
that had a sex change.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.243
-Did you not see that?
-What on earth are you
talking about?

05:26.243 --> 05:29.204
Look at that butt!
Look at that hair.
She's wearing lipstick, Gerry!

05:29.204 --> 05:31.623
-Simon, did you see
the turtleneck?
-Turtleneck?

05:31.623 --> 05:33.750
-To cover the Adam's apple.
-What?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.585
-That's what she's doing.
-That's not what turtlenecks
are for.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.130
-Ask her to pull her
turtleneck down.
-I would never do that.

05:38.130 --> 05:40.757
-Pull it down yourself, you'll
see a big lump right there.
-I would never do that.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.926
-I don't have an Adam's apple.
-Check it out.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.385
-You're just jealous because
I called dibs first.
-No!

05:44.385 --> 05:46.054
Dibs on what?
The sub?

05:46.054 --> 05:47.931
I wouldn't mind making a
cold cut combo on that sub.

05:47.931 --> 05:52.644
-All right, okay... no.
-Gerry, I already called dibs.

05:52.644 --> 05:55.147
-Are you serious?
I didn't hear you.
-You have to respect my dibs.

05:55.147 --> 05:58.817
-Rookie, see you out there.
-Simon, meet the pieman.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.987
And you, stay out of this.
Quiet time.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.906
Do not cut my grass.
Don't cut my grass.

06:04.906 --> 06:08.035
It's a guy. You guys
are fighting over a man.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.578
It is out of both of
your leagues, by the way.

06:10.578 --> 06:13.957
Atheism is accepted by
many different forms of
religion.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.294
-Like Jainism...
-Hence Lewis's earrings.

06:17.294 --> 06:20.755
-Hinduism and Buddhism...
-Hippy religions.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.717
And various different types
of Neopaganism like Wicca.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.426
Okay, you know what?
That's great, that's enough.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.428
This is turning into
a gong show here.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.264
You just making stuff up now?

06:29.264 --> 06:30.682
This is world religions,

06:30.682 --> 06:33.268
not some creative writing
thing you're doing.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.394
Sir, please, I put a lot
of research into this.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.189
Well then you should have
studied that God exists.

06:37.189 --> 06:40.399
And he is all powerful.
Biggest power. Nothing's bigger.

06:40.399 --> 06:44.821
Okay, supposing God does
exist and that he is, in fact,
all powerful then tell me this:

06:44.821 --> 06:48.075
Can he make a rock so heavy
that he can't pick it up?

06:48.075 --> 06:50.827
-Obviously.
-So he can't pick it up then?

06:50.827 --> 06:52.704
No, he can pick it up.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.456
But then he failed in
making a rock so heavy
he can't pick it up.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.377
What? He can't...

07:01.004 --> 07:04.091
-Get out, get out.
-I didn't say anything.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.802
It's not a question first of
all, it's some sort of circular
thing you're doing.

07:07.802 --> 07:11.639
-Sir, it's called a paradox.
-It's called a paradox,
thank you.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.808
Sir, maybe you and Lewis
should have a debate.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.894
Yeah Maya, 'cause I got
nothing better to do

07:15.894 --> 07:18.772
than just debate
Lewis about something
that doesn't even exist.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.400
Sir, I'm sorry if my
paradox scared you.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.360
Scared me.

07:25.237 --> 07:29.783
Fine, the debate is on.
How's that for a paradox?

07:29.783 --> 07:33.161
Ha-ha, you can stay.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.540
Surprise!

07:37.540 --> 07:39.542
Come on, guys,
I told you not to go crazy.

07:40.919 --> 07:44.756
-Happy Birthday, sir.
-The big five-eight huh?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.636
I know you said no presents,
but I couldn't help myself.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.347
You are a source of inspiration
to me every single day in here.

07:52.347 --> 07:57.436
And I hope it's okay,
but I took the liberty of
putting it down on paper.

07:57.436 --> 08:01.522
Just what you mean to me in
this piece of original artwork.

08:01.522 --> 08:05.860
Pecs...just read it.

08:08.280 --> 08:11.699
-Is this a poem Robert?
-Three back-to-back haikus.

08:11.699 --> 08:15.787
-How very thoughtful.
-Thank you.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.998
I got you a little
something too, sir.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.707
Now, Trudy.

08:19.707 --> 08:22.127
Oh, my God. A diving watch.

08:22.127 --> 08:25.297
Oh, it's just a little
something. So you like it?

08:25.297 --> 08:29.759
I'm speechless, I mean Trudy,
this is the most thoughtful gift
anyone has ever given me.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.928
Well, you're worth it, sir.

08:33.930 --> 08:37.184
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

08:38.726 --> 08:41.062
Happy Birthday.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.398
Oh, look, I'll read
the poem Robert.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.236
[Gerry whispers] Hey Father.
How's it going?

08:48.236 --> 08:53.825
Ah, not sure if you remember me
but I coach at Xavier Academy.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.203
You did a prayer for my girls'
basketball team one day.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.955
-Yes, I remember you.
-Yeah, I was the coach.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.083
-Ahhh, nice.
-Wait, is this your parish?

09:02.083 --> 09:07.839
-Uhhh...
-Because I don't recall
seeing you at mass, ev...

09:07.839 --> 09:10.300
-[duck quack noise]
-That's my phone. One second.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.887
I gotta take this Father,
give me one second.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.974
[quietly] Hello.
What's up buddy?

09:17.974 --> 09:19.518
[laughs]

09:19.518 --> 09:22.812
-I know. I know, I heard.
-Give me strength.

09:22.812 --> 09:26.441
That's awesome.
We're gonna get drunk.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.735
What do you mean it's shut down?
We'll go to the other one.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.820
I don't know where it is.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.240
Hold on. Father, do you
know that liquor store...

09:33.240 --> 09:34.699
Are you here for
confession or not?

09:34.699 --> 09:37.952
Hold on one sec.
Uh, no, no, no.

09:37.952 --> 09:43.083
First of all, you know
who I am now, so I can't
tell you my sins.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.834
Why are you here?

09:44.834 --> 09:46.794
Well, I have a student
in my class,

09:46.794 --> 09:51.799
he's atheist and I gotta prove
to him that God exists.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.094
Do you have any pointers
on how do I prove it?

09:54.094 --> 09:58.598
Well, if there were
definitive proof then
we wouldn't need faith.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.892
We would just believe.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.727
Yeah, okay Father,
this kid's really smart,

10:02.727 --> 10:04.854
I can't just give him
some lame stuff like that.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.149
Do you know anything
about a rock? He's always
talking about a rock.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.610
-No, no my son.
-Yeah! He's up on
the "my son" stuff.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.197
I think that's the language
that's getting priests in
trouble. Call me Gerry.

10:14.197 --> 10:17.909
Tell me about the rock.
Father?

10:21.662 --> 10:23.331
[whistles]

10:28.211 --> 10:31.923
Mr. Leung, I need a
book on the life of God.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.426
Mr. Melvil Dewey will be happy
to help you.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.886
Learn his system,
and you'll find what you need.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.556
I don't know who that is and
he's not the librarian, you are.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.225
So can you just tell me where
I can find a book about God?

10:42.225 --> 10:44.685
May I suggest you read the
best selling book of all time?

10:44.685 --> 10:47.105
Oh, okay, Harry Potter?
That's gonna help.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.566
The Bible.

10:49.566 --> 10:54.112
Not the book God wrote.
I want a book about his life.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.448
I don't know anything
about your God.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.450
What do you mean about my God?
It's our God.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.452
I practice Shenism-Taoism.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.997
Terrorism? Doesn't
surprise me at all.

11:03.997 --> 11:07.000
I think you need to read.
Period.

11:08.751 --> 11:12.297
[Robert hisses]
Ooh, la-la.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.635
Happy Birthday and one day.
[purrs]

11:16.635 --> 11:19.471
-Oh, my God.
-What is that?

11:19.471 --> 11:22.307
-It's chinchilla.
-[Trudy laughs]

11:22.307 --> 11:24.934
I just thought this says
happy birthday in ways
that my card didn't.

11:24.934 --> 11:27.562
-So happy birthday.
-Robert, in what universe

11:27.562 --> 11:30.273
do you think that I would
wear a full length fur coat?

11:30.273 --> 11:31.483
It also comes in three quarter.

11:31.483 --> 11:34.735
[laughing]

11:34.735 --> 11:37.364
Nice going, Trudy.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.782
Well, I guess you're gonna
have to take that back.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.951
I can't Trudy.
That's the thing.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.703
But good for you.
You must be awfully
proud of yourself.

11:44.703 --> 11:47.165
-Why?
-Well, because you were trying
to outdo me and you did.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.709
-So yay, Trudy.
-I'm not trying
to outdo you Robert.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.630
He lost that watch two
years ago on a diving trip.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.798
He likes my gift because
it was thoughtful.

11:55.798 --> 12:00.053
-Really? Then what was my poem?
-Your poem was... cheap.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.805
But that coat wasn't
cheap was it Robert?

12:02.805 --> 12:04.683
-[hisses]
-[Trudy laughs]

12:07.519 --> 12:09.521
-Hey, Bobbi.
-Hmm.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.398
See the sub? It's a guy.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.276
-What?
-It's a guy.

12:15.276 --> 12:19.447
-What are you? 12?
-Just take a look. Look!

12:19.447 --> 12:22.409
-Take a look, seriously.
-No, it is very clearly
a woman, Gerry.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.370
-Well, you're not
the best judge.
-What did you say?

12:27.622 --> 12:29.666
-Yeah, thought so.
-[Simon] Hey, Bobbi.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.543
Hey, Simon.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.379
Oh, like what you see Gerry?
Get a nice eyeful...

12:34.379 --> 12:37.048
[clicking tongue]
...'cause that's my girl.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.842
-It's a guy, Simon.
-Oh, if it's a guy, then why is
she going on a date with me?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.844
You gotta be kidding me.
You didn't ask her out.

12:41.844 --> 12:45.432
Oh, I asked her and she agreed.
Props up top.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.808
-Have you seen
The Crying Game?
-No, good movie?

12:47.808 --> 12:50.186
-Just follow my
lead here. Hey!
-Hey, guys.

12:50.186 --> 12:53.106
-Why don't you join us?
-Can't, gotta get
to my next class.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.858
-Oh.
-Is that a drip?

12:55.858 --> 12:57.736
-Where?
-It's right above your head.

12:57.736 --> 13:01.197
Where? Do you feel a drip?
Where is there a drip?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.283
-There's a drip.
-[Simon] Where do
you see a drip?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.993
-Look up. Look Up.
-I don't see it. Guide my eyes.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.538
-I don't see anything.
-Look, there's a drip.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.249
-Look, I've really got
to get to my next class.
-Okay.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.586
But if I see anything,
I'll let someone know.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.380
-See you tonight Simon?
-See you tonight.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.092
-There's no drip Simon.
-What?

13:21.092 --> 13:23.428
Okay, I wanted to see if
she had an Adam's apple.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.305
I was trying to get her
to expose her neck.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.265
But she kept looking up with me,
then looking down with me.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.851
You really got to see
The Crying Game before
you go on this date.

13:30.851 --> 13:33.104
I'm gonna watch
that movie. Funny?

13:33.104 --> 13:35.732
Yeah. You'll both enjoy it.
She might be in it.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.946
I've never seen
you read before.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.449
I don't know how this is the
best selling book of all time.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.160
What do you know about
debating? Let alone religion?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.828
Okay, I know a lot about
religion, because I was
raised very Catholic.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.872
We went to church every Sunday.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.959
So I know all the sayings,
all the responses. For instance:

13:54.959 --> 13:57.836
"Lord have mercy," then you say,
"Christ have mercy."

13:57.836 --> 14:00.089
Then you gotta come
back to "Lord have mercy."

14:00.089 --> 14:02.383
-You wouldn't know that.
-I do not know that.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.260
-What does it mean?
-I don't know.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.220
-This is going to be a disaster.
-I'm in trouble.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.722
I think you are in trouble, you
have no chance against this kid.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.557
-I'll call in sick.
-You know what you could do?

14:09.557 --> 14:12.143
Remember your strategy
from teacher's college
for presentations?

14:12.143 --> 14:14.979
All style, no substance.
Yes! You could do that.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.315
You have no substance. You could
just, like, put on a little
smoke and mirrors show.

14:17.315 --> 14:19.150
-A little razzle dazzle.
-Big show.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.194
-A little David Blaine, right?
-Yeah...who?

14:21.194 --> 14:22.696
-David Blaine.
-Who's that?

14:22.696 --> 14:24.364
-He's a magician.
-Get him to come in.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.699
Oh yeah, do your presentation?

14:25.699 --> 14:27.367
-Call him.
-He's famous, he's on TV.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.951
Well then, why are
you bringing him up?

14:28.951 --> 14:30.995
To help inspire, for the show.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.955
Don't tell me you can get
him if you can't get him.
Who brings up somebody

14:32.955 --> 14:35.208
and then says I can't get them?
-Are you serious?

14:35.208 --> 14:38.169
You got me all excited.
You said David Blaine,
like I'll get David Blaine.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.592
[Lewis] Oh, and um, so...

14:44.592 --> 14:50.557
that is why
I don't believe in God.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.226
I don't believe in God.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.229
[clapping]

14:56.229 --> 15:01.401
Yes! Clap. Thank you my son
for not believing in me.

15:01.401 --> 15:06.280
But how foolish are you?
I am here in front of you.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.533
Do not listen to that man.
Follow me.

15:08.533 --> 15:12.537
Follow me on Twitter as well,
if you like. I'm everywhere.

15:12.537 --> 15:17.709
You cannot deny that Jesus
is standing in front of you.

15:17.709 --> 15:22.088
I am also, God,
the Father of Jesus,

15:22.088 --> 15:26.593
and I am the Holy Spirit as
well, three things into one.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.720
Which is confusing,
I understand.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.347
But I am here for you,
my children.

15:31.347 --> 15:35.309
Do not listen to evil,
non-believers follow me.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.144
You must be Jimmy.

15:37.144 --> 15:40.231
'Cause God, slash Jesus,

15:40.231 --> 15:44.360
slash Holy Spirit
knows everyone.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.196
-You believe in me, my son?
-I will for an A in the class.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.824
-You will never
get an A, my son.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.159
You are stupid.
Get out, Jimmy.

15:52.159 --> 15:56.915
-Go to the gates of Hell! Die!
-Would Jesus do that?

15:56.915 --> 15:59.542
Just get out, would you?
You're screwing up
the whole story.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.546
I'm doing a presentation.
That was Satan,

16:03.546 --> 16:07.383
also known as Jimmy.
Satan is an A-hole.

16:07.383 --> 16:13.514
Amen to that. But I am real.
My blood is for you.

16:13.514 --> 16:19.103
I have died for you,
I have come back etc., etc.

16:20.897 --> 16:24.191
You will not betray me,
Jesus Christ,

16:24.191 --> 16:27.403
the son of God, who exists.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.991
[whispers] I win.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.077
[whispers] It's just ketchup,
don't worry about it.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.872
In the name of me,

16:37.872 --> 16:42.376
and me and me and me, amen.

16:42.376 --> 16:45.045
[Callaghan] Look, Duncan,
I shouldn't have to tell you,

16:45.045 --> 16:47.882
you don't bring your personal
beliefs into the school.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.134
They're everyone's beliefs.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.052
It is Xavier's policy...

16:52.052 --> 16:57.057
Come on, I can't yell at you
when you're dressed like that.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.393
-Is that better?
-You are gonna write

16:59.393 --> 17:03.189
the parent of every student
in that class and apologize.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.900
Why don't I just write one...?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.945
Xavier accepts every religious
faith, without bias.

17:08.945 --> 17:12.031
You know the teachings of
my religion are forgiveness.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.950
Thank you. Go.

17:13.950 --> 17:17.495
That's a lot of writing, sir,
but Jesus can do it.

17:18.997 --> 17:22.917
-Get out!
-Good luck when you die, sir.

17:26.128 --> 17:30.132
-[Gerry] Hey Trudy.
-[Trudy] Hey, my Lord.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.051
[Robert] Sir, pardon me?

17:32.051 --> 17:35.095
After careful consideration
and a little bit of research,

17:35.095 --> 17:39.976
I think I've found, maybe,
the perfect gift worthy
of the day of your birth.

17:39.976 --> 17:41.978
Robert, this is
completely unnecessary.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.481
Please, please just indulge me.
Hear me out.

17:48.651 --> 17:51.445
-It's your family tree.
-My God.

17:51.445 --> 17:55.324
-This is incredible.
-I mean, it's no diving watch.

17:55.324 --> 17:59.537
It shows who all of your
relatives were, where they
lived, when they died.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.249
Very impressive, Robert.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.376
Oopsy, look at that,

18:05.376 --> 18:09.589
your great-grandfather
died at 60. Shame.

18:09.589 --> 18:13.092
Oh look, your great-grandmother
too, also died at 60.

18:13.092 --> 18:19.223
In fact, oh weird, looks
like not too many of your
ancestors made it past 60.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.518
That's funny.
Not funny ha-ha, obviously.

18:22.518 --> 18:25.939
It was a different time.
That's not what's important.

18:25.939 --> 18:30.568
What's important is,
a pretty special person
got you a birthday gift.

18:30.568 --> 18:34.989
-Happy birthday, sir.
-Yeah, happy birthday.

-Hey, Wayne, you that Dan...
-I don't care, Gerry.

18:53.591 --> 18:56.302
-How'd you find out?
-Well, she came over
to watch a movie

18:56.302 --> 18:58.972
and I got my mom out
of there by telling her some of
the guys were coming over.

18:58.972 --> 19:02.683
Technically, that's true.
-Anyway, we're watching the
movie and we start to kiss.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.478
-And I felt a lump.
-A lump?

19:05.478 --> 19:09.107
Sure, yeah. Anyway, the movie
ends, we're out on the porch,
I'm kissing her goodnight.

19:09.107 --> 19:12.485
She is beautiful, Gerry.
Strong hands.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.113
French kissing is weird,
it's like little snakes
in your mouth.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.949
Anyway, let me ask you
something, in terms of bases...

19:17.949 --> 19:20.618
Does this count?

19:20.618 --> 19:24.204
Sure. Yes! First base baby!
You finally got there.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.583
-Second base.
-Second? Okay. Second not third?

19:27.583 --> 19:29.168
I rounded it too,
looked at third.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.087
-You didn't go near third?
-I had to go back.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.589
-Afternoon ladies.
-I got to second base.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.633
-No, not with Danni?
-Yeah, with Danni.

19:35.633 --> 19:39.846
-Dude! No, I was gonna tap that.
-Yes!

19:39.846 --> 19:41.931
-This coat is amazing.
-I thought we were vibing.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.350
-Well.
-I'm ten times the man you are.
Details, let's go.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.602
I was right? Remember that.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.395
-[Simon] We kissed.
-[Robert] Where?

19:48.395 --> 19:50.731
-[Simon] Porch.
-[Robert] You dirty, dirty dog.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.693
-[Simon] Yeah, I felt
pretty dirty.
-I have transgendar!

19:53.693 --> 19:56.779
No one believed me.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.953
Thanks for nothing,
Father Judas.

20:03.953 --> 20:07.581
I don't know what that stuff
you were saying, but it didn't
help me with the rock story.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.709
So what do you have
to say for yourself?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.711
You're supposed to help us,
when we come here.

20:11.711 --> 20:16.007
Nothing, just as I thought.
Pathetic.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.509
Forgive me Father,
for I have sinned.

20:18.509 --> 20:22.221
It's been six months since
my last confession.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.016
And these are my sins.

20:25.016 --> 20:28.268
I slept with my deceased
husband's colleague.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.897
Okay, okay, okay.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.565
[clears throat]

20:32.565 --> 20:36.235
Well, that can happen.
One thing leads to another...

20:36.235 --> 20:42.116
So, you have a couple
drinks... and... things...

20:42.116 --> 20:44.077
Get out of hand,
I've been there.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.496
I've been there many times.
So don't worry, he's dead.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.707
So you didn't do anything wrong.

20:49.707 --> 20:53.293
I wouldn't worry too much about
it. So just practice safe sex,

20:53.293 --> 20:56.756
and make sure you check
your blood pressure.

20:56.756 --> 21:01.719
And how about we do,
I don't know, why don't we do...

21:01.719 --> 21:07.391
Why don't we do three Hail
Marys and two Our Fathers.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.310
Do three Our Fathers
and you're good to go.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.981
-Thank you Father.
-You're welcome.
