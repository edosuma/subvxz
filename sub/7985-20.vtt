03:25.878 --> 03:27.414
There's so much to talk about.

03:29.184 --> 03:31.990
Now, first of all,
I just want to say something.

03:31.990 --> 03:33.560
Legit, I'm actually
a real fan of the show.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.330
I've watched many of you as,
like, babies, like, you're...

03:35.330 --> 03:37.669
Now you're all,
like, young women,

03:37.669 --> 03:40.006
and your impact
as dancers has inspired

03:40.006 --> 03:41.142
so many people.

03:41.142 --> 03:43.681
How many girls have been
inspired by the dancers

03:43.681 --> 03:44.716
and wanted to dance and...

03:44.716 --> 03:46.385
(cheering)
Yeah.

03:46.385 --> 03:48.056
I should say
"girls and guys,"

03:48.056 --> 03:50.160
'cause I'm a dude,
but, uh...

03:50.160 --> 03:52.431
You know, we're saying good‐bye
to Maddie and Mackenzie.

03:52.431 --> 03:53.968
And what's crazy is

03:53.968 --> 03:55.905
the only original
cast members

03:55.905 --> 03:57.909
are Nia,
Kenzie and I.

03:57.909 --> 04:00.380
Yeah.
And, I mean,
everyone's still...

04:00.380 --> 04:01.482
like, well, they're original
to us because we're...
Yeah.

04:01.482 --> 04:02.484
...we've become so
close with them.

04:02.484 --> 04:04.388
But, honestly, like,

04:04.388 --> 04:06.425
Kenzie was six and
I just turned eight

04:06.425 --> 04:07.562
when we started the show.

04:07.562 --> 04:09.198
Nia was, like, nine.
And I was nine.

04:09.198 --> 04:10.668
So, only OG left
will be Nia.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.437
It's only gonna be me! (laughs)

04:12.437 --> 04:14.441
(audience cheers)

04:16.613 --> 04:19.284
Kenzie, how did you
find out that...

04:19.284 --> 04:20.286
(laughs)

04:20.286 --> 04:21.656
...you were gonna
be leaving the team?

04:21.656 --> 04:24.061
Well, when we were in pyramid,
my sister was like,

04:24.061 --> 04:25.698
"I have to tell you
something, but I can't."

04:25.698 --> 04:28.169
And I was like, "Okay,
well, that's rude."

04:28.169 --> 04:30.407
So, she's like "Oh, you're
really gonna like this."

04:30.407 --> 04:31.409
I was like, "Okay."

04:31.409 --> 04:32.779
So then, later,

04:32.779 --> 04:34.649
my mom got all the girls,

04:34.649 --> 04:36.720
and she told them that

04:36.720 --> 04:38.891
we were going to leave,
which I didn't even know.

04:38.891 --> 04:40.393
And my mom didn't want
to tell Mackenzie,

04:40.393 --> 04:42.030
'cause she said sometimes
she's a blabbermouth, so...

04:42.030 --> 04:43.166
(laughs)
You know?

04:43.166 --> 04:44.368
MACKENZIE:
I was just really shocked,

04:44.368 --> 04:46.305
'cause I feel like I would've
been there till the end.

04:46.305 --> 04:47.909
Mmm.
'Cause I was there
from the beginning...

04:47.909 --> 04:49.078
Yeah.
...so it was just...

04:49.078 --> 04:50.080
Shocking.

04:50.080 --> 04:51.616
It's just weird to think about

04:51.616 --> 04:53.019
our two sisters leaving

04:53.019 --> 04:54.656
and we're not gonna be with them
every single weekend.

04:54.656 --> 04:57.094
All the memories we've been
through, like, we've travelled

04:57.094 --> 04:58.831
literally everywhere together.

04:58.831 --> 05:00.400
Out of the country...

05:00.400 --> 05:01.435
It's just crazy.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.106
Well, let's take
a look at the moment

05:03.106 --> 05:04.809
when the girls learned

05:04.809 --> 05:07.481
that Maddie and Mackenzie were
gonna be leaving the show.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.218
And ugly crying.
I don't want
to cry right now!

05:09.218 --> 05:11.857
So what's goin' on, Melissa?

05:11.857 --> 05:12.859
MELISSA:
Okay, so, Mackenzie, listen,

05:12.859 --> 05:15.096
'cause you
don't know this.

05:15.096 --> 05:20.106
Maddie and Mackenzie and
I are going to be here

05:20.106 --> 05:21.442
for four more weeks.

05:21.442 --> 05:23.780
And then we're moving on.

05:23.780 --> 05:25.751
That's just sad.

05:25.751 --> 05:26.953
Um, we'll always be... sorry.

05:26.953 --> 05:28.790
(sniffling)

05:28.790 --> 05:30.293
We love you guys so much.

05:30.293 --> 05:32.865
This has been such
a great ride together.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.303
I love you guys so much.

05:35.303 --> 05:37.107
(sniffling)

05:37.107 --> 05:41.650
So, let's let this next
four weeks be so amazing.

05:41.650 --> 05:42.652
Okay...
'Kay?

05:44.288 --> 05:46.125
JOJO:
Ugh!

05:46.125 --> 05:47.695
And I don't usually
cry that much.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.666
But I've been
with them for so long...

05:49.666 --> 05:52.337
I've known you guys
before the show even started.

05:52.337 --> 05:53.941
I lived with them
for 12 weeks,

05:53.941 --> 05:55.544
so it's, like,
hard to see them leaving.

05:55.544 --> 05:57.915
JOJO: I haven't even been here
as long as you have.

05:57.915 --> 06:00.688
The only person that's been
here shorter than me is Brynn,

06:00.688 --> 06:03.025
but, like, I'm so close
to you guys...

06:03.025 --> 06:04.328
And especially over the season,

06:04.328 --> 06:05.998
I feel like I've gotten
really close with you.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.503
(laughing):
We've gotten really close!

06:08.503 --> 06:10.541
MADDIE:
When we heard the news,
we were...

06:10.541 --> 06:12.077
obviously, everyone was
really, really sad,

06:12.077 --> 06:15.618
but then, after we did our
last group dance together,

06:15.618 --> 06:17.187
like, our last
competition together,

06:17.187 --> 06:19.057
that's when it really hit us,
because we're like...

06:19.057 --> 06:21.328
We didn't realize, like, "Wow."

06:21.328 --> 06:22.999
Like, "After
this day is..."

06:22.999 --> 06:24.669
You guys' last solos
is what hit me.

06:24.669 --> 06:26.071
Well, you know what?
We actually...
Oh.

06:26.071 --> 06:27.073
...we actually have that,
so let's take a look at that.

06:27.073 --> 06:29.444
JOJO:
Of course!

06:29.444 --> 06:31.916
These girls and this show

06:31.916 --> 06:35.290
have changed dance a lot.

06:35.290 --> 06:39.565
And these girls have been
glorious role models.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.903
(sharp exhale)
This is their mom.

06:41.903 --> 06:43.139
MELISSA:
I just want to thank...

06:47.347 --> 06:50.988
...Abby for everything
you've done for my kids

06:50.988 --> 06:53.392
through the years, and Gia...

06:53.392 --> 06:54.962
I'm sorry, I just...

06:54.962 --> 06:56.465
Maddie's gonna
take it from here.
Maddie can take it.

06:56.465 --> 06:58.770
I just want to thank Abby, Gia

06:58.770 --> 07:01.041
and all of my other dance moms

07:01.041 --> 07:02.377
and all the girls.

07:02.377 --> 07:04.716
(applause)

07:04.716 --> 07:06.485
Thank you, now Mackenzie.

07:06.485 --> 07:09.324
I also want to thank them, too,

07:09.324 --> 07:12.030
but it's just
really hard to leave, but...

07:12.030 --> 07:13.132
(laughs, sniffs)

07:13.132 --> 07:15.136
I can't. (chuckles)

07:15.136 --> 07:16.105
Thank you.

07:16.105 --> 07:18.209
Seemed pretty choked up
and now

07:18.209 --> 07:19.211
you're crying now.

07:19.211 --> 07:21.115
I really couldn't talk.

07:21.115 --> 07:22.117
(nervous laugh)

07:22.117 --> 07:24.922
I was too upset to say anything.

07:24.922 --> 07:27.762
So I just want to ask
one more question.

07:27.762 --> 07:28.797
Now, how do you feel
like the team morale is

07:28.797 --> 07:30.868
now that the girls are leaving?

07:30.868 --> 07:32.137
It's gonna be weird.

07:32.137 --> 07:33.707
I mean, just
take a second

07:33.707 --> 07:35.410
to look down
the line, you guys,

07:35.410 --> 07:36.913
and stop where Jai is.

07:36.913 --> 07:38.249
Like, it's just...
this is the team now.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.251
(softly):
No, it isn't.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.587
Like, you guys will obviously

07:40.587 --> 07:43.092
always be a part of the team,
but in pyramid,

07:43.092 --> 07:45.463
standing there,
it's just gonna be us.

07:45.463 --> 07:46.933
Yeah, we're not gonna
be at the pyramid.

07:46.933 --> 07:48.269
And it's crazy to think that

07:48.269 --> 07:49.906
Maddie's not gonna be
at the top anymore.

07:49.906 --> 07:51.275
Who's gonna be at the top, then?

07:51.275 --> 07:52.611
Ooh, guys, we have a shot now!
Yay!

07:52.611 --> 07:54.281
(laughter)
We got a shot!

07:54.281 --> 07:56.351
Someone needs to take over
the timing, now, because...

07:56.351 --> 07:57.086
I will.
NIA: Me, too.

07:57.086 --> 07:58.657
JoJo, are you?

07:58.657 --> 08:00.159
JoJo...
(laughter)

08:00.159 --> 08:02.798
JOJO: I'm gonna come back
next season and be goals.

08:02.798 --> 08:04.569
I am going to stretch every day,

08:04.569 --> 08:06.271
I'm going to the gym
every night,

08:06.271 --> 08:07.675
I'm going to have
a six‐pack...

08:07.675 --> 08:08.743
Are you?
I am going to...

08:08.743 --> 08:10.848
(laughter)
Really?
In a whole month?

08:10.848 --> 08:11.916
And that's my...
that's what's happening.

08:11.916 --> 08:13.185
Six‐pack.
A six‐pack?

08:13.185 --> 08:14.187
RODRIGUEZ: Six‐pack,
that's the new move.

08:14.187 --> 08:15.657
So, while we're on the topic,

08:15.657 --> 08:17.393
Maddie, you were gone
a lot of this year

08:17.393 --> 08:18.964
working on other projects

08:18.964 --> 08:20.366
and while you were gone,
it seemed like

08:20.366 --> 08:21.803
Abby was trying
to fill your shoes,

08:21.803 --> 08:23.673
so the question that
everyone was talking about

08:23.673 --> 08:25.711
this entire season was,

08:25.711 --> 08:27.815
"Who will be
the next Maddie?"

08:27.815 --> 08:29.184
Who do you... who do
you think it'll be?

08:29.184 --> 08:31.321
MADDIE:
Abby was saying that maybe

08:31.321 --> 08:33.459
I was passing the torch
to Brynn,

08:33.459 --> 08:36.198
because she's the new
member on the team,

08:36.198 --> 08:37.701
but we're the originals,
so I feel like

08:37.701 --> 08:40.239
no one can honestly
become the next...

08:40.239 --> 08:41.843
like, the new Maddie
and Mackenzie, but th...

08:41.843 --> 08:42.845
they can be
their own person.

08:42.845 --> 08:44.481
BRYNN:
You're yourself.

08:44.481 --> 08:46.853
Like, it doesn't make sense.

08:46.853 --> 08:49.424
I mean, what was the most
difficult part of this season?

08:49.424 --> 08:51.896
Well, you know, being new,

08:51.896 --> 08:54.067
like if you're
a new kid at school,

08:54.067 --> 08:56.204
like, it's difficult, always,
at the beginning.

08:56.204 --> 08:57.641
It's just different, I mean,

08:57.641 --> 08:59.679
it's good that we had
a new team member because...

08:59.679 --> 09:01.114
I mean, you've been in
that position before.
...it brings...

09:01.114 --> 09:03.052
I have been in
that position before,

09:03.052 --> 09:05.423
and, like she said, it's tough
when you come in, because...

09:05.423 --> 09:07.628
Well, I had to be on probation.

09:07.628 --> 09:09.966
She didn't.
You've had
a lot of solos.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.468
MADDIE: Yeah, you've had
a lot of solos.
NIA: Yeah.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.871
I had two this season!

09:12.871 --> 09:14.441
I've had, like, four.

09:14.441 --> 09:16.311
I don't really like
when Abby says,

09:16.311 --> 09:17.413
"Oh, you're the next Maddie,

09:17.413 --> 09:18.717
you better do good,
you better win."

09:18.717 --> 09:20.353
I'm like, "No."

09:20.353 --> 09:22.223
I can be a new member
of the team,

09:22.223 --> 09:24.027
but I want to be Brynn.

09:24.027 --> 09:26.031
I think she's a great
addition to the team.

09:26.031 --> 09:28.035
Over the past, like,
four months,

09:28.035 --> 09:31.008
me and Brynn got really close.
BRYNN: Yeah.

09:31.008 --> 09:32.343
And it's just, like, she
blends in right with us.
Yeah.

09:32.343 --> 09:33.647
RODRIGUEZ:
All right.

09:33.647 --> 09:35.984
(cheering)
Nice!

09:35.984 --> 09:37.320
When we come back,

09:37.320 --> 09:39.925
old friends will say farewell
to Maddie and Mackenzie.

09:39.925 --> 09:42.030
And we have an
amazing performance

09:42.030 --> 09:43.933
from the incredible
Todrick Hall.

09:43.933 --> 09:45.002
Stay with us.

09:48.108 --> 09:50.881
RODRIGUEZ:
<i>Coming up...</i>
♪ ♪

09:50.881 --> 09:52.350
You guys having fun?

09:52.350 --> 09:53.987
(audience cheers louder)

09:53.987 --> 09:56.191
Welcome back to <i>Dance Moms.</i>

09:56.191 --> 09:59.264
Today we're looking back at our
time with Maddie and Mackenzie

09:59.264 --> 10:01.334
before they leave
the show for good.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.608
Um, let's talk about the minis.

10:04.608 --> 10:05.777
Oh...

10:05.777 --> 10:08.048
BRYNN:
I love the minis!
(laughter)

10:08.048 --> 10:09.050
I love them!
RODRIGUEZ:
I know, wait.

10:09.050 --> 10:10.319
Kenzie, te...
you got really close

10:10.319 --> 10:11.856
with the minis this season.
Why? Tell me.

10:11.856 --> 10:13.960
I was just always
the youngest of the team,

10:13.960 --> 10:16.298
so I feel like I could
really relate to them.

10:16.298 --> 10:19.170
Kenzie's, like, the one that's,
like, really nice to the minis

10:19.170 --> 10:21.108
and, like, their friend.
I mean,

10:21.108 --> 10:23.145
I'm nice to them, too!
No! All of us are!

10:23.145 --> 10:24.715
But, usually,
I'm in the room

10:24.715 --> 10:26.619
with the minis when
they're learning their choreo,

10:26.619 --> 10:28.957
and it is a hot mess!

10:28.957 --> 10:31.729
And they're skinny and then
they just walk in in these
little, like, underwear,

10:31.729 --> 10:32.998
and they're just, like...
These little...
Oh, my gosh, their outfits

10:32.998 --> 10:34.267
are, like, crazy.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.338
I'm like,
"I wish I could wear that."

10:36.338 --> 10:37.173
(chuckles)
Me, too.

10:37.173 --> 10:38.510
Now, Maddie
and Mackenzie,

10:38.510 --> 10:41.348
we have a little
special surprise for you.

10:41.348 --> 10:43.285
It's a farewell video of,
uh, some familiar faces.

10:43.285 --> 10:44.287
Take a look.
Ooh.

10:44.287 --> 10:45.891
I'm really anxious.

10:45.891 --> 10:47.493
Hey, Maddie and Mackenzie!

10:47.493 --> 10:50.634
(screaming)
We're popping in
to say good‐bye!

10:50.634 --> 10:53.172
No way!
Did you know
that they were leaving?

10:53.172 --> 10:56.344
No.
Yes, they're‐they're no longer
gonna be dancing

10:56.344 --> 10:58.282
with the Abby Lee Dance Company!

10:58.282 --> 11:00.219
They're gonna spread
their wings,

11:00.219 --> 11:02.423
and they're gonna take off
and they're gonna fly!

11:02.423 --> 11:05.597
After being
under that awful crow for all

11:05.597 --> 11:08.536
of those years,
they are finally gonna go do
(laughter)

11:08.536 --> 11:10.005
some fun things.

11:10.005 --> 11:13.345
Hey, Maddie and Mackenzie,
it's me, Black Patsy.

11:13.345 --> 11:16.017
I know you guys are moving.
Probably not a good thing.
Oh, my God, that's Nicaya!

11:16.017 --> 11:17.453
Sorry about that.
I knew
this was coming.

11:17.453 --> 11:21.261
Anyway, I hear you guys
got paroled from ALDC.

11:21.261 --> 11:23.031
I mean,
you're leaving the team,

11:23.031 --> 11:25.436
you're getting away
from Abby. Good for you!
Oh, my God.

11:25.436 --> 11:27.306
Hi, Maddie and Mackenzie.
It's Jeanette.
Aw.

11:27.306 --> 11:30.145
Hey, Maddie and Mackenzie,
it's Gino.
Oh, my...!

11:30.145 --> 11:31.983
I'm really gonna miss
you guys on the show.
NIA: It's Ava.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.955
You guys have been
such a big part of it.
Ava, I love her!

11:34.955 --> 11:37.628
Um, the team loves you,
and we all love you.

11:37.628 --> 11:40.266
And so... I don't know.
It's definitely
gonna be different.

11:40.266 --> 11:43.071
Yeah, it's gonna be...
a lot different.
It's gonna be
different without you guys.

11:43.071 --> 11:45.342
It's crazy, like, you guys
have been there for so long,
(squealing)

11:45.342 --> 11:47.213
and now it's all over.
But don't worry.

11:47.213 --> 11:49.484
You're moving on
to greater, greater things.

11:49.484 --> 11:51.555
You have no idea what's gonna
happen to you guys.

11:51.555 --> 11:53.492
You guys have
a huge future ahead.

11:53.492 --> 11:55.830
Halleloo, hey! Say what?!

11:55.830 --> 11:59.470
It's your girl Shangela Laquifa,
honey, giving

11:59.470 --> 12:02.076
a special message to my girls
Maddie and Mackenzie.

12:02.076 --> 12:04.414
I have watched y'all dance
and grow,

12:04.414 --> 12:06.284
and I'm so thankful
to have been a part

12:06.284 --> 12:08.890
of just a little piece
of the journey.
<i>Aw.</i>

12:08.890 --> 12:10.994
I love you guys.
Keep death dropping, honey.

12:10.994 --> 12:14.100
Yes! Like me and Nia. Bye.
(laughs)

12:14.100 --> 12:15.770
Oh. Um, well,

12:15.770 --> 12:18.710
um...
MACKENZIE: Vivi!
She's talking!

12:18.710 --> 12:20.379
Oh, um...
(laughter)

12:20.379 --> 12:21.649
Good luck?

12:21.649 --> 12:23.786
Oh, good luck,
I guess.

12:23.786 --> 12:27.460
Hey, Maddie, remember that kiss?
(laughter, gasping)

12:27.460 --> 12:29.297
That was pretty funny.
Aah!

12:29.297 --> 12:31.869
We were both so young
when that happened.

12:31.869 --> 12:33.873
Hopefully, we've moved on‐‐
I know I have‐‐

12:33.873 --> 12:36.545
and we've matured from it
and we can just get back

12:36.545 --> 12:39.250
to the friendship that we used
to have, which was a great one.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.256
One thing I will say about
Maddie is she has grown into

12:42.256 --> 12:44.193
such a beautiful, mature dancer.

12:44.193 --> 12:46.131
She's a pleasure
to watch onstage.

12:46.131 --> 12:49.037
And Mackenzie
will always make me smile.

12:49.037 --> 12:52.043
That little girl is always full
of energy, and I truly...

12:52.043 --> 12:54.247
She‐she holds a special place
in my heart.

12:54.247 --> 12:56.184
Thank you!
Aside from all
of our competition

12:56.184 --> 12:58.523
and all of our hoo‐ha
with each other,

12:58.523 --> 13:00.025
I think that, Vivi and I,

13:00.025 --> 13:02.329
we love Maddie
and Mackenzie and...

13:02.329 --> 13:04.467
(kisses)
We love you guys.

13:04.467 --> 13:06.839
Okay, love you guys!
Bye! Wish you the best!

13:06.839 --> 13:08.175
Kinda.

13:08.175 --> 13:10.613
(laughter)

13:10.613 --> 13:11.682
"Kinda"!

13:12.918 --> 13:13.686
Oh!

13:13.686 --> 13:14.721
MACKENZIE: That just ruined it!

13:14.721 --> 13:16.659
JOJO: "Kinda."
NIA:
You know what...

13:16.659 --> 13:18.328
You will not talk
about that video!

13:18.328 --> 13:21.367
"Remember that kiss?" Huh?
(whooping)

13:21.367 --> 13:22.771
Remember
that kiss?

13:22.771 --> 13:24.775
I can't forget about it!
Wait a minute,

13:24.775 --> 13:27.113
you had a kiss in
the dance number. Let's clarify.
Okay, yeah.

13:27.113 --> 13:29.651
Every time I did the dance,
Abby made me kiss him.

13:29.651 --> 13:31.087
It was very embarrassing
though, because

13:31.087 --> 13:33.058
I had to do it
in front of the judges...

13:33.058 --> 13:34.661
And Gino liked Maddie
at that time.

13:34.661 --> 13:36.397
(laughter)
RODRIGUEZ: So, now,

13:36.397 --> 13:37.934
Mackenzie,
what are you gonna miss

13:37.934 --> 13:39.070
about Cathy?

13:39.070 --> 13:42.076
Well, I think
she definitely...

13:42.076 --> 13:45.082
Stop touching my hair.
She was fixing.

13:45.082 --> 13:47.554
She would pick on the moms,
but it would be, like...

13:47.554 --> 13:49.558
it would be really funny,
what she said,

13:49.558 --> 13:51.729
so we would just all laugh
about it.

13:51.729 --> 13:54.200
But... And Vivi always gave us
a laugh.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.605
RODRIGUEZ:
When we come back, we'll
have the world premiere

13:56.605 --> 14:00.613
of a new music video and
a performance by Todrick Hall.

14:00.613 --> 14:02.183
But right now,
the girls are performing

14:02.183 --> 14:04.688
Mackenzie's favorite
group number of the season,

14:04.688 --> 14:07.661
"Boss Ladies"!
(cheering and applause)

14:07.661 --> 14:11.234
(giggling)
Okay, hope my weave
doesn't fall out.

16:12.242 --> 16:15.382
Now, this is the last season

16:15.382 --> 16:18.321

final moments with the girls.

16:18.321 --> 16:19.624
Okay, so you might
not know this, Kendall,

16:19.624 --> 16:21.862

your YouTube channel.

16:21.862 --> 16:22.764
Oh, that's so embarrassing.

16:22.764 --> 16:23.766

16:23.766 --> 16:25.603
It is so good!
I'm a starter,

16:25.603 --> 16:27.372
so I'm not good
at YouTube music.
No, no, no.

So, for those of you who have
been living under a rock,

Right?

16:34.754 --> 16:37.861
I had them make up
the questions.

16:37.861 --> 16:40.933
And I had, like, eggs and milk,

16:40.933 --> 16:43.572

have honestly...

21:02.890 --> 21:05.294

Yeah.

21:05.294 --> 21:07.533
There's a lot
of social media hate,

21:07.533 --> 21:09.504
and, you know,
I would sometimes

21:09.504 --> 21:12.042
be sad over it and, you know,
they just tell me, like,

21:12.042 --> 21:13.545
"Hey, girl,
don't be sad, like,

21:13.545 --> 21:15.749
there's no need
for haters, so..."

I realized that you just
can't listen to the hate.

21:17.686 --> 21:19.657

you actually recorded a song

21:19.657 --> 21:21.193

I did.

23:51.393 --> 23:52.730
GIRLS: Yeah.
Yes, a lot,

23:52.730 --> 23:55.635

agree with it,

I know, right.

put up with this anymore"

24:13.571 --> 24:16.076

All right,
well...
Preach!

25:00.297 --> 25:03.938
So, while we're on the topic
of speaking up for yourselves,

25:03.938 --> 25:06.376
if there was one thing
that you girls could say

25:06.376 --> 25:08.313
to Abby with no consequences,
what would it be?

25:08.313 --> 25:10.619
We're gonna go around
the room, and I'm gonna

25:10.619 --> 25:11.888
help you out.
Maddie, go!

25:11.888 --> 25:13.223
Oh!

25:13.223 --> 25:15.160
(laughter)
NIA:
Okay, I have one.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.196
I have one.

25:16.196 --> 25:17.699
Miss Abby?
Yes.

25:17.699 --> 25:19.402
Please keep your tissues
to yourself.

25:19.402 --> 25:20.772
Okay, I will.
She...

25:20.772 --> 25:22.108
She's been really sick lately,

25:22.108 --> 25:24.012
so she's been getting
all these tissues and, like...

25:24.012 --> 25:25.515
(grunting) ...and blowing
her nose into them.

25:25.515 --> 25:26.684
JOJO:
I'm the best at

25:26.684 --> 25:28.521
her blowing‐nose impression.

25:28.521 --> 25:30.625
(groans,
flatulence‐like sputtering)

25:30.625 --> 25:32.629
(loud, honking nose‐blowing)

25:35.134 --> 25:36.469
Please just keep
your tissues to yourself.

25:36.469 --> 25:38.006
All right, I...
Yes, Kalani?

25:38.006 --> 25:40.144
Miss Abby, if you're gonna
use something of mine,

25:40.144 --> 25:41.514
please give it back.

25:41.514 --> 25:43.083
We were
in Australia,

25:43.083 --> 25:44.887
and she took my sweatshirt,

25:44.887 --> 25:47.158
she ordered ribs
with barbeque sauce

25:47.158 --> 25:48.828
all over 'em,
she's eating her ribs

25:48.828 --> 25:50.364
with my sweatshirt on her lap,

25:50.364 --> 25:53.270
and she's just,
"Num, num, num, num."
How about when she...?

25:53.270 --> 25:55.775
"Num, num, num, num,
num, num, num."
(laughter)

25:55.775 --> 25:57.478
And I was like,
"You can keep it."

25:57.478 --> 25:58.781
Abby has funny habits.

25:58.781 --> 26:00.150
She always is, like,

26:00.150 --> 26:02.556
goes like this, and she goes.
NIA:
Oh, yeah.

26:02.556 --> 26:04.359
And then she goes like that.
RODRIGUEZ:
All right, ladies.

26:04.359 --> 26:06.731
Wait a minute. I have a clip
that I think you're gonna enjoy.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.035
Take a look.
NIA: Okay.
BRYNN: Yes!

26:09.035 --> 26:10.337
This is probably
gonna be disgusting.

26:10.337 --> 26:13.210
KALANI:
Ew!
(laughter)

26:15.381 --> 26:16.784
(laughing)

26:16.784 --> 26:18.988
(laughter)

26:20.224 --> 26:22.495

26:28.975 --> 26:30.912
(laughter)

26:30.912 --> 26:32.616
BRYNN:
Oh, my God!

26:34.352 --> 26:36.256
(laughter)

26:36.256 --> 26:37.993
(applause)
Oh, my God.

26:37.993 --> 26:40.197
NIA:
That was ugly.

26:40.197 --> 26:42.468
JOJO:
What was that?

26:42.468 --> 26:43.504
That video will probably stay

26:43.504 --> 26:45.742
with all of us for
a very long time.

26:45.742 --> 26:48.146
All right, switching gears
a little bit, uh... (chuckles)

26:48.146 --> 26:50.451
Do you guys want
to see Mackenzie perform?

26:50.451 --> 26:52.221
(cheers and applause)
Her single? Yeah? All right.

26:52.221 --> 26:54.225
Let's give the audience
what they want, shall we?

26:54.225 --> 26:57.098
All right, when we come back,
we'll have the world premiere

26:57.098 --> 27:00.772
of a new music video and
a performance by Todrick Hall.

27:00.772 --> 27:03.143
But right now,
let's give a round of applause

Welcome back to <i>Dance Moms.</i>

29:24.358 --> 29:27.131
Today, we are sharing memories
of Maddie and Mackenzie

29:27.131 --> 29:29.770
since this is
their last season with the show.

29:29.770 --> 29:31.974
It seems like <i>Dance Moms</i> has
really touched people

29:31.974 --> 29:33.243
all over the world.

29:33.243 --> 29:34.513
How do you feel like

29:34.513 --> 29:37.218
<i>Dance Moms</i> has affected
the rest of the world?

29:37.218 --> 29:39.055
Honestly, it inspired
a lot of people

29:39.055 --> 29:41.493
to dance. I think
a lot of people were either,

29:41.493 --> 29:44.266
like, scared or unconfident,
but I think

29:44.266 --> 29:47.205
seeing, in the beginning,
Maddie, Mackenzie and Nia,

29:47.205 --> 29:50.913
and, honestly, even Kendall,
Kalani, me and Brynn‐‐

29:50.913 --> 29:52.950
they think, "Oh, my gosh,
I want to be like Maddie!"

29:52.950 --> 29:54.152
"Oh, my gosh,

29:54.152 --> 29:55.221
I want to be
like Kenzie!" Like,

29:55.221 --> 29:56.891
I feel like they start dance,

29:56.891 --> 30:00.598
and they grow the confidence
to do that because of us.

30:00.598 --> 30:02.168
That's awesome.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.571
(cheers and applause)

30:03.571 --> 30:07.212
All right, this is like the hard
part, but not to get, like,

30:07.212 --> 30:09.850
super serious or sappy, but you
have been here for six years.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.921
It's been highs and lows,
dramatic, super fun,

30:11.921 --> 30:15.795
and obviously,
a lot of love, so, um,

30:15.795 --> 30:17.632
let's take
a look at...
Oh!

30:17.632 --> 30:19.336

My eye's just itchy.

30:22.175 --> 30:23.410
Keep it together.

30:23.410 --> 30:25.681
These are my two daughters,
Maddie and Mackenzie.

30:25.681 --> 30:27.118
Maddie's eight,
and Mackenzie's six,

30:27.118 --> 30:29.189
and they're both dancers.

30:29.189 --> 30:30.691
ABBY LEE:
Maddie, are you ready to be

30:30.691 --> 30:32.762
front and center?
Can you handle that pressure?

30:32.762 --> 30:33.864
MADDIE:
<i>I don't like to lose,</i>

want to see those tears.

MACKENZIE: <i>I love dancing,</i>
<i>but I don't want</i>

30:50.431 --> 30:51.968
to go on Broadway.

30:51.968 --> 30:56.143
All I want to do is just
stay home and eat chips.

30:57.312 --> 30:58.915

31:09.502 --> 31:11.908
Maddie and Mackenzie will be
competing against each other.

31:11.908 --> 31:13.477

'cause she's against you.

MADDIE:
<i>I hope</i>

31:14.646 --> 31:17.118
you do great, but I hope

31:17.118 --> 31:19.222
that you don't beat me.

32:33.804 --> 32:35.274
Um, I'm definitely...

32:35.274 --> 32:38.514
