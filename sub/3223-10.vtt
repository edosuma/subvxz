00:02.160 --> 00:03.730
You're alive. What happened?

00:03.880 --> 00:06.884
Standing close to exploding Dick
sends your ass to purgatory.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.485
How did you get out?

00:34.320 --> 00:36.527
- Hello, Dean.
- How did you make it out?

00:36.920 --> 00:39.651
Hello, Castiel. My name is Naomi.
We rescued you.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.001
- Hell gates.
- What about hell gates?

00:41.160 --> 00:44.687
The tablet told me of stuff
about closing the gates of hell, forever.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.764
Amelia Richardson.
She and I had a place in Kermit, Texas.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.163
- What are you doing?
- Leaving. I'm trying to do the right thing.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.203
You and Don deserve a chance.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.765
- Dean?
- You're an angel?

00:54.920 --> 00:56.126
My name is Samandriel.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.245
There are more tablets?

00:59.400 --> 01:02.404
More than Leviathan and demon?

01:02.720 --> 01:03.801
Innocent lives.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.685
- Risk that on Benny's word?
- Damn right I am.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.207
Lay down your arms,
you unholy thing!

01:09.360 --> 01:12.091
- What do you want?
- I want your head on a stake.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.090
No!

01:15.240 --> 01:16.480
- Is it done?
- Yeah.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.210
- Any casualties?
- Martin.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.442
- Was it Benny?
- He had it coming, Sam.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.330
Naomi?

01:40.560 --> 01:42.403
Naomi, Crowley has me.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.089
Ah, ah, ah.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.561
Been on angel radio, have we?

02:08.720 --> 02:10.449
No.

02:12.440 --> 02:15.922
Don't lie to me, Alfie.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.124
I'm not lying.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.845
Please, I wouldn't lie to you.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.403
Oh, Alfie,
after all these weeks together.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.801
Yeah, how I wish that were so.

02:30.680 --> 02:36.130
Now we're going to have to turn off
that signal.

02:37.160 --> 02:39.128
Again.

02:40.040 --> 02:41.724
No.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.325
No!

02:44.000 --> 02:47.641
No!

03:25.920 --> 03:27.888
Who'd you expect?

03:31.640 --> 03:34.564
- Long drive.
- I wouldn't have had to make it...

03:34.720 --> 03:37.724
- ...if you hadn't hung up on me.
- I heard all I needed to hear.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.043
You heard what you wanted to hear.
Told you Benny wasn't killing.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.288
I watched him end the fangbanger
that was.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.602
How about Martin?
How did he end that?

03:45.760 --> 03:48.969
Stupid, just like I said it would.
Didn't give Benny a choice.

03:49.160 --> 03:52.164
- It was self-defense.
- Seriously, Dean?

03:52.320 --> 03:54.926
That's that story you're going with?

03:55.080 --> 03:57.560
That the vampire
was the real victim here?

03:57.720 --> 04:01.611
Like it or not, that's the truth. There
was a time when that meant something.

04:01.800 --> 04:02.926
Yeah. Yeah, no kidding.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.726
What does that mean?

04:04.880 --> 04:08.487
- You think this is just about Benny?
- What the hell are you talking about?

04:08.680 --> 04:10.648
What do you think I'm talking about?

04:10.800 --> 04:11.881
Amelia?

04:13.320 --> 04:15.527
I sent you that text
because I needed you to...

04:15.680 --> 04:17.250
You need me to what?

04:17.640 --> 04:21.611
To tear ass to Texas, to be afraid
that what happened to Jessica...

04:21.760 --> 04:24.286
...what happened to everybody
we ever cared about...

04:24.440 --> 04:27.649
- ...might have happened to her?
- What was I supposed to do?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.404
Is that what we are?

04:29.560 --> 04:32.086
You save a vampire...

04:32.240 --> 04:35.369
...by making me believe
that the woman I love might be dead?

04:37.680 --> 04:39.284
What do you wanna hear, Sam?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.523
That I was wrong?

04:42.680 --> 04:45.047
Fine. I was wrong.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.804
Okay?

04:46.960 --> 04:50.760
But if you'd heard me out, trusted me,
all of this could've been avoided.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.571
You didn't want me to trust you.
You wanted me to trust Benny.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.484
And I can't do that.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.761
All right.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.124
Okay, well then,
what the hell do we do now?

05:04.640 --> 05:06.529
That depends.

05:07.360 --> 05:09.362
It depends on you.

05:09.960 --> 05:12.611
On whether or not
you're done with him.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.167
Well, honestly, I don't know.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.521
Glad I made the drive.

05:48.280 --> 05:49.884
He's been crying for two days.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.407
The doctors missed something.
It's called an inguinal hernia.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.846
Very hard to detect.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.641
Castiel.

06:08.840 --> 06:12.686
We have a situation.
Samandriel has been captured.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.842
I thought Samandriel was dead.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.843
He's been missing.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.970
And now we know. Crowley has him.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.764
- Where?
- His distress call cut out...

06:22.920 --> 06:25.321
...before I could pinpoint
his exact location.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.324
But you will find him
and you will bring him home.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.169
Crowley will have warded against angels
this time.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.402
- I'll need help.
- Take whatever you need.

06:35.560 --> 06:37.767
But you will be certain, Castiel.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.207
It was your idea to rescue Samandriel.

06:40.360 --> 06:43.682
Not mine, not heaven's.
Do you understand?

07:01.520 --> 07:02.931
Damn it, Cass!

07:03.240 --> 07:04.844
How many times I gotta tell you?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.321
- It's just creepy.
- Dean, I need your help.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.845
The angel, Samandriel...

07:09.640 --> 07:11.961
- Sam...
- ...he's been taken.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.891
You mean Alfie?
The wiener-on-a-stick kid?

07:15.600 --> 07:18.809
Yes. I...

07:19.160 --> 07:21.242
I heard his distress call this morning.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.807
On angel radio?
I thought you shut that down?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.525
My penance, it's going well.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.882
And I thought it was time
to turn it back on.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.850
I've, uh, been helping people, Dean.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.809
Well, good for you.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.564
All right.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.964
So who snatched heaven's
most adorable angel?

07:38.240 --> 07:39.969
Crowley.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.246
I'm listening.

07:42.520 --> 07:46.002
Samandriel's being held in the general
vicinity of Hastings, Nebraska.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.561
The general vicinity?
That's all you got?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.683
Yes. Which is why I need your help.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.685
It seems this is gonna involve
talking to people.

07:57.280 --> 08:00.090
Come on, Cass,
I thought you were a hunter now.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.807
Yeah, well, I thought so too.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.646
But it seems I lack a certain...

08:07.840 --> 08:09.171
Skill?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.286
You saw nothing.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.363
All right, ahem, what am I looking for?

08:23.560 --> 08:27.121
Well, when you torture an angel,
it screams.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.567
And that kind of pain...

08:29.720 --> 08:32.166
...it creates a ripple effect
of strange incidents.

08:34.559 --> 08:35.640
Where's Sam?

08:36.799 --> 08:38.563
Sam's gone.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.451
We'll, uh, find Alfie ourselves.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.485
This charming
little dung beetle makes his living...

08:44.640 --> 08:46.005
...upon the sands of Egypt.

08:46.160 --> 08:49.164
Here, billions of tiny particles,
the remnants of ancient seas...

08:50.720 --> 08:53.326
...are pushed ever higher
by the relentless winds of the Sahara.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.803
This is where the dung beetle
makes its living.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.325
The ancient Egyptians...

08:59.880 --> 09:03.248
Look, last night at the bar,
I just wanted to make sure it was you.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.210
You know...

09:06.360 --> 09:07.850
...peeping in my window.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.286
Peeping? You make it sound so...

09:13.440 --> 09:15.249
Stalkerish?

09:17.840 --> 09:20.002
Anyway, I ran out...

09:20.200 --> 09:21.406
...because he was leaving.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.688
He travels a lot, since he's been back.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.444
Right. No, I get it.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.840
You had someplace...

09:27.080 --> 09:28.650
I had to be. Yeah.

09:28.840 --> 09:32.481
Are we gonna have a whole conversation
with me finishing your sentences?

09:34.640 --> 09:36.881
So why are you here?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.451
It's not what it looks like.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.888
I thought you were in trouble,
that you had...

09:44.160 --> 09:46.083
It doesn't matter. You're okay.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.366
I was.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.484
Okay.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.964
You know, settled in, content.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.888
But here you are.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.164
What am I supposed to do with that?

10:00.320 --> 10:02.163
Give me five seconds and I'll be gone.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.210
I didn't come here to make trouble
for you. I came because...

10:05.400 --> 10:06.890
You cared.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.170
See that?

10:12.400 --> 10:14.641
I just did it again.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.931
I finished your sentence.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.163
Yeah, I care.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.929
I care too.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.569
I told you it was an accident.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.210
Yes, of course.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.250
But now there should be
no more accidents.

10:39.440 --> 10:42.603
No more angel radio.

10:42.760 --> 10:44.489
Stop this, please.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.291
- It's been...
- Weeks, yes.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.851
We're almost there, though.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.246
I'm certain of it.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.487
I'm begging you.

10:51.640 --> 10:56.931
When we demons possess a human,
we invade all of them.

10:57.080 --> 11:01.005
Their muscles, their bones,
their brains.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.765
I can't help but wonder
if it isn't the same for angels.

11:08.040 --> 11:09.246
No.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.326
Ha!

12:26.280 --> 12:28.009
Mr. Hinkley?

12:28.160 --> 12:31.164
Hi. We're from the Geneva Gazette.

12:31.760 --> 12:36.448
Wanted to ask you a few questions
about your ambush. Heh.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.170
Yeah, well, I'd laugh too...

12:40.360 --> 12:43.011
...if it didn't feel like the sun
just ate my face.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.563
It's a metaphor.

12:47.960 --> 12:51.567
Sorry. Now, in the police report,
it said that the bush...

12:51.720 --> 12:53.722
...it talked to you, yeah?

12:53.880 --> 12:56.360
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy,
but yeah.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.681
What did it say?

12:57.880 --> 12:59.609
No clue.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.842
Sounded like Klingon to me.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.844
Gonna need exact words.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.764
Are you serious?

13:06.400 --> 13:09.006
That's his serious face, yes.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.047
Heh.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.968
As much as you can remember,
Mr. Hinkley.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.926
Sounded something like:

13:18.560 --> 13:20.050
Soll-vock.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.001
Yeah.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.731
Sol I-vock-tay.

13:30.120 --> 13:33.169
- What? Mean anything to you?
- Yes. It's Enochian.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.401
It means obey.

13:34.560 --> 13:35.846
Obey? Obey what?

13:36.040 --> 13:39.203
I don't know, but the amount of pain
an angel must be in...

13:39.360 --> 13:42.011
...not just to manifest
through shrubbery, but to burn.

13:42.160 --> 13:45.482
Dean, we have to find him
before it's too late.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.486
Okay.

13:47.680 --> 13:51.730
Okay, well, look, a sign like that,
Alfie can't be too far, right?

13:51.880 --> 13:55.009
So we'll just start at the bush
and work our way out.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.086
And look for what?
Crowley could have him anywhere.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.771
If I know Crowley, place'll be swarming
with demons. We'll drive till we see ugly.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.961
It's official.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.248
I hate motels.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.011
Say something.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.321
What would you like me to say?

14:17.520 --> 14:18.806
That was great?

14:19.000 --> 14:22.641
That was a mistake?

14:23.080 --> 14:24.366
I don't know.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.806
Both, I guess.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.089
I understand.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.330
Do you?

14:35.480 --> 14:38.689
Do you understand I have a life here?

14:38.840 --> 14:41.764
A good man that loves me.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.210
A man I don't wanna hurt.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.364
I know.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.800
Do you know you're first thing I think
about when I wake up in the morning...

14:50.960 --> 14:53.281
...and the last thing
before I go to sleep?

14:56.120 --> 14:58.805
It's tough
to let something like that go.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.281
Yeah.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.001
Especially if you keep showing up
here.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.527
You're saying you want me to leave?

15:06.680 --> 15:09.968
I'm telling you that if you stay...

15:10.440 --> 15:13.842
...against everything I believe in...

15:14.240 --> 15:15.685
...I would be with you.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.201
But if you leave...

15:20.720 --> 15:21.926
...don't come back.

15:24.160 --> 15:28.131
I can't have you with one foot in my life
and one foot out there...

15:28.320 --> 15:30.846
...doing whatever it is you do.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.602
That life of yours
I have no idea about.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.730
You don't wanna know about it.
Believe me.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.850
That's a big step.

15:41.560 --> 15:42.721
For me or you?

15:42.920 --> 15:44.524
Both.

15:46.440 --> 15:51.810
I need to think about this.
You need to think about this.

15:52.720 --> 15:55.371
Words will never cover
what you mean to me.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.366
What you'll always mean to me,
but we should...

15:58.560 --> 15:59.766
Think about this.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.286
Okay.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.246
How about two days from now?

16:07.840 --> 16:09.490
Around 7:30.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.051
I'll be off work then.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.887
One of us will be here...

16:15.040 --> 16:16.405
...and we'll know.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.640
Neither of us will be here...

16:21.040 --> 16:22.405
...and we'll know.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.686
Or both of us will be here...

16:29.120 --> 16:30.326
...and we'll know.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.125
Well, will you look at that?

16:59.280 --> 17:01.965
Our ninth abandoned factory.
Ain't that America?

17:02.680 --> 17:03.841
This doesn't pan out...

17:04.040 --> 17:07.726
...we head back to that beer and bacon
happy hour about a mile back, huh?

17:07.920 --> 17:09.729
Wait a minute, Dean.

17:10.119 --> 17:12.167
Those derelicts, they're demons.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.527
I can see their true faces.

17:18.319 --> 17:22.405
Crowley's got that many hell monkeys
outside, he's gotta have double inside.

17:22.599 --> 17:23.964
And angel warding.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.122
I can feel it.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.331
Well, you, me and the demon knife
ain't gonna cut it.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.807
Okay, I'll get Sam.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.849
No, we don't need Sam.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.480
- You just said...
- If Sam wanted in, he'd be here.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.244
Okay?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.930
I got a better idea.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.003
Slow read?

18:04.040 --> 18:05.963
The slowest.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.929
Where's Garth?

18:08.200 --> 18:10.328
Supply run, I don't know.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.683
I sort of lost track
of when he comes and goes.

18:14.680 --> 18:17.650
You guys need help or something?
I'm working here.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.643
You look horrible.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.726
Yeah. Thanks.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.689
He's right. Are you okay, Kevin?

18:25.920 --> 18:28.207
I'm fine. I'm just...

18:28.760 --> 18:30.250
In the middle of this.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.641
And? Any luck?

18:32.840 --> 18:36.322
Interpreting half a demon tablet? No.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.763
I got nothing.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.011
All right, well, buck up...

18:42.160 --> 18:46.131
...because we need some more
of that demon TNT, ASAP.

18:46.560 --> 18:47.766
You used it all.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.241
Yeah, so let's whip up another batch.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.521
Sure.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.765
West Bank witch hazel,
skull of Egyptian calf...

18:54.920 --> 18:57.605
...the tail of some newt
that may or may not be extinct.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.650
All right, I get it.
Ingredients are hard to come by, huh?

19:00.800 --> 19:03.371
That's just the first three ingredients.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.802
Give me the list,
I'll get what we need.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.604
Ah.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.321
What on earth
could you possibly need now, Viggo?

19:25.880 --> 19:28.963
I've given you every torture instrument
known to man.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.610
Short of a Neil Diamond album.

19:30.760 --> 19:33.161
I've found something, sir.
I need a translator.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.810
You're looking at him.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.889
Show me.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.409
What have we here?

19:47.200 --> 19:49.646
I think it's Enochian.

19:49.920 --> 19:52.161
Of course it's Enochian, you pigeon.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.606
The question
is why is he speaking Enochian?

19:56.320 --> 19:58.926
What have you drilled into here, Viggo?

20:05.240 --> 20:06.446
Bollocks.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.404
What is it, sir?

20:11.080 --> 20:16.450
Well, what our feathered friend
was uttering essentially was:

20:16.600 --> 20:20.207
"You, celestial being, have been created
to be an angel of the Lord."

20:22.160 --> 20:24.606
You've got into his operating system.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.524
His factory settings.

20:26.680 --> 20:29.001
From who? God?

20:29.320 --> 20:31.084
Who cares where it comes from?

20:31.240 --> 20:34.403
Let's find out
what makes this flying monkey tick.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.649
I mean, come on.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.168
How long does it take
to get a calf skull from Egypt?

21:15.040 --> 21:16.530
Kevin.

21:17.480 --> 21:18.766
Kevin.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.846
Your mom is hot.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.241
I'm serious. Your mom is one sexy...

21:40.360 --> 21:42.169
I thought I told you
to go underground.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.600
Hey.

21:43.760 --> 21:47.560
I am so far under I'm breathing
through a straw, brother. Heh.

21:48.840 --> 21:53.129
Look, what happened
with your friend Martin back there...

21:53.280 --> 21:55.282
...it wasn't supposed to go down
that way.

21:55.600 --> 22:01.846
- I know. Your granddaughter told me.
- Dean, you did this old dog a real solid.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.371
The way you stood up for me.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.161
Shoe on the other foot,
you'd have done the same.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.844
Yeah. I hate to ask for much else...

22:10.000 --> 22:13.288
...but I don't suppose there's any chance
you're near the Catskills?

22:13.440 --> 22:16.046
Working a case on the
other side of the country. Why?

22:16.200 --> 22:19.170
Yeah, just hitting a little rough patch,
I guess.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.641
You know,
doing this whole solo thing.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.049
Benny, one day at a time, man.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.364
You know what?

22:28.080 --> 22:30.367
A cup of coffee
sure would do me good.

22:30.520 --> 22:34.491
All right, as soon as I'm done with this
case, I'll, uh, I'll be there, okay?

22:34.640 --> 22:36.290
Yeah.

22:36.800 --> 22:40.202
All right, brother. Thank you.

22:49.280 --> 22:50.930
Hey.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.448
Where is your mom?

22:54.360 --> 22:55.566
Somewhere safe.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.649
You kicked your mom to the curb?

22:59.240 --> 23:01.447
She was too distracting.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.726
I couldn't focus.

23:04.560 --> 23:08.042
The angels said I had to go to the desert
to learn the Word of God.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.725
This is my desert.

23:09.880 --> 23:11.723
Yeah, but your mom's your mom.

23:13.200 --> 23:16.170
I can't enjoy a world
I need to save, Dean.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.243
I can enjoy it when this is over with.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.129
But right now...

23:20.480 --> 23:22.960
There's nothing more important
than this.

23:40.160 --> 23:44.051
Watching humanity,
it never gets old, does it?

23:50.840 --> 23:52.046
I got what we need.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.208
About time.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.484
What's he doing here?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.685
Don't worry, Dean.
Once we save Alfie, I'm out.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.491
No, once we save Alfie.
Don't hurt yourself, Sam.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.041
- Cass and I can handle it.
- Not according to Cass.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.690
I told you we didn't need him.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.728
We need everything, Dean.

24:14.520 --> 24:18.844
And I need both of you,
as you say, to stow your crap.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.729
Can you do that?

24:50.880 --> 24:54.521
So there are four main points of warding.
North, south, east, and west.

24:54.720 --> 24:57.485
And four Enochian symbols...

24:57.880 --> 24:59.689
...like this...

24:59.840 --> 25:02.684
...that you need to destroy
before I can enter.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.641
So we go in, take care of the hell mooks
and you extract the angel?

25:06.800 --> 25:08.211
Yes.

25:08.760 --> 25:12.287
After killing so many,
I need to save at least this one.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.890
Sounds like a plan.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.371
Okay.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.370
Let's do this.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.010
Wait, here.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.450
This doesn't just work on angels.
It kills demons too.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.083
Thanks, Cass.

25:58.400 --> 26:01.244
Well, not my most original work,
but...

27:08.920 --> 27:10.604
What is it?

27:10.760 --> 27:13.923
That was tablet talk.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.285
Protecting the Word of God seems to be
hard-wired into these dingbats.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.768
- Thanks.
- Come on.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.285
Demon tablet?

28:53.440 --> 28:55.568
Tell me one I don't know, huh?

29:00.880 --> 29:02.609
Alfie.

29:31.640 --> 29:36.362
Not that this isn't important, but we
should be making preparations to leave.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.363
We seem to be under attack.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.045
Did you say something?

30:00.720 --> 30:02.245
All right, anytime now, Cass.

30:05.880 --> 30:08.451
Cass? Hey, you okay?

30:09.880 --> 30:11.689
Must be the sigils.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.683
I'm not at full power.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.444
Sam, help me muss this crud.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.400
No, wait, there's no time.
Samandriel won't last much longer.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.843
Cass, here, take this.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.290
Dean, hurry up.

30:43.640 --> 30:45.642
All right, plan B.

30:45.800 --> 30:46.881
We have a plan B?

30:55.840 --> 30:57.046
As you were saying...

31:01.760 --> 31:04.081
Cass, anytime now.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.804
Yes?

31:12.960 --> 31:15.486
Spit it out, you heavenly pile of filth!

31:21.040 --> 31:22.246
Holy mother of sin.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.562
What? What is it?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.401
There's an angel tablet.

32:17.640 --> 32:18.641
Hold still.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.681
Wait! I know things.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.769
Cass. Go.

33:02.640 --> 33:03.721
Okay, good, good.

33:03.960 --> 33:07.169
There's so much you don't know.
You need me.

33:08.760 --> 33:10.569
Yeah?

33:10.720 --> 33:11.881
Yeah, I don't think so.

33:18.840 --> 33:20.080
It's okay.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.323
You're safe now.
I'm taking you home.

33:23.520 --> 33:26.126
No.
You can't take me back there, Castiel.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.201
Why not?

33:28.400 --> 33:30.129
You don't understand.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.965
I told Crowley things.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.804
Things he shouldn't have known.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.087
He got to our coding, our secrets.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.930
Secrets I didn't even know we had.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.246
What secrets?

33:41.640 --> 33:42.880
Heaven?

33:43.080 --> 33:44.161
Naomi?

33:44.320 --> 33:45.810
No. Who's Naomi?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.764
Who is...?

33:48.080 --> 33:49.161
Listen to me.

33:49.640 --> 33:50.721
Listen to me closely.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.287
I've been there. I know.

33:53.480 --> 33:55.005
They're controlling us, Castiel!

33:55.160 --> 33:56.650
What do you mean?

33:57.360 --> 34:00.204
- Kill him.
- What does he mean controlling us?

34:00.360 --> 34:03.125
- Castiel...
- Who is controlling us?

34:03.280 --> 34:06.409
Why did I see your face?
Why was I so afraid?

34:06.600 --> 34:07.931
What did you do to me?

34:08.080 --> 34:10.764
This is a direct order. Kill him!

34:33.440 --> 34:34.726
What did I just do?

34:34.920 --> 34:36.888
You killed a traitor.

34:37.920 --> 34:40.127
Samandriel was good.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.850
And I was trying to atone for...

34:42.000 --> 34:43.809
Samandriel was broken.

34:43.960 --> 34:46.929
He revealed the existence
of what I would die to protect.

34:47.080 --> 34:49.208
What any of us would die to protect.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.721
The angel tablet, Castiel.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.324
Crowley knows.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.771
I just murdered one of our own
to protect a tablet?

35:03.400 --> 35:06.688
If the demon tablet can seal demons
in hell...

35:06.880 --> 35:09.406
...what do you think
the angel tablet could do to us?

35:11.200 --> 35:13.567
You're a hero, Castiel.

35:13.720 --> 35:16.166
You've done heaven a great service.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.682
And that's what I tell Sam and Dean?

35:22.440 --> 35:23.851
Cass.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.411
What the hell happened?

35:25.600 --> 35:28.922
You tell the Winchesters
that Samandriel had been compromised.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.528
He was compromised.

35:32.680 --> 35:35.286
He came at you
and you acted in self-defense.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.048
He came at me.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.367
I killed him in self-defense.

35:41.520 --> 35:43.921
Say you must return his body
to heaven...

35:44.120 --> 35:45.565
...and then bring him to me.

35:47.680 --> 35:48.761
Cass, you okay?

35:54.000 --> 35:57.243
My vessel must have been damaged
in the melee.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.085
I have to go.

36:00.240 --> 36:03.369
Samandriel's remains
belong in heaven.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.962
I need to see just how far
Crowley dug into him.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.570
Do you understand?

36:14.800 --> 36:17.246
Yes, I understand.

36:19.960 --> 36:21.246
Cass, wait.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.084
Thank you both.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.562
For everything you've done.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.363
Cass.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.602
Okay, that should do it.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.047
Cass can't see or hear us now.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.208
- Okay, what the hell?
- I know.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.931
Something was off
since he got back from purgatory.

37:07.080 --> 37:08.809
- Someone's messing with him?
- Who?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.081
Angels?

37:10.240 --> 37:12.607
Why would the angels have him kill
another angel?

37:18.280 --> 37:20.169
You know what, man, I got this.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.924
You go.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.765
What?

37:23.920 --> 37:25.729
Don't you have a girl to get back to?

37:26.880 --> 37:29.326
Yeah, I guess I do. Um...

37:33.080 --> 37:35.242
Since when are you
on the Amelia bandwagon?

37:36.120 --> 37:37.770
I don't know.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.601
I'm just tired of all the fighting.

37:42.160 --> 37:46.370
And, you know,
maybe I'm a little bit jealous.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.928
I could never separate myself
from the job like you could.

37:50.480 --> 37:54.121
Hell, maybe it's time
for at least one of us to be happy.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.760
What,
you being such a big hugger and all?

38:01.000 --> 38:02.525
She does make me happy...

38:02.680 --> 38:05.729
...and she could be waiting for me
if I went back.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.329
I'd be a very lucky man if she was.

38:12.080 --> 38:15.448
But now with everything staring down
at us...

38:15.640 --> 38:17.768
...with all that's left to be done...

38:19.600 --> 38:21.250
I don't know.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.491
Huh.

38:24.360 --> 38:25.441
Yeah.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.242
Well, I do know this.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.323
Whatever you decide...

38:30.480 --> 38:32.005
...decide.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.804
Both feet in or both feet out.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.042
Anything in between
is what gets you dead.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.362
Yeah, I keep hearing that.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.203
I'm gonna take a walk.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.044
Clear my head.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.651
Dean.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.763
I thank you mightily, bud.

39:32.920 --> 39:35.491
I'm in a hard way here.
How close are you?

39:35.680 --> 39:38.286
I'm sorry, man, I...

39:39.280 --> 39:40.725
I'm not gonna make it.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.446
You mean now or...?

39:44.600 --> 39:45.840
Listen, Benny.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.688
Everything you've done for me,
I will never forget.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.410
But...

39:54.520 --> 39:56.249
This is it.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.209
End of the line?

40:01.320 --> 40:03.129
End of the line.

40:05.200 --> 40:08.841
Yeah, well,
I never liked these cell phones, anyway.

40:09.040 --> 40:10.530
You...

40:11.040 --> 40:13.247
You stay good, all right?

40:13.400 --> 40:15.209
You too, Dean.

40:16.040 --> 40:19.362
And thanks for the ride.

40:19.720 --> 40:21.643
Yeah, man.

40:23.720 --> 40:25.449
Adiós.
