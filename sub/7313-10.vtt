WEBVTT

00:08.043 --> 00:11.000
[quiet, indistinct police
radio communication]

00:24.043 --> 00:25.695
Hmm.

00:25.739 --> 00:27.782
What's wrong with
this picture?

00:27.826 --> 00:29.391
Let's check it out.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.304
Someone's in the car.

00:42.304 --> 00:45.260
Hey! Hey, mister![man groans]

00:45.304 --> 00:47.695
Now, let's go, buddy.

00:47.739 --> 00:49.478
[groans quietly]
Out.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.478
Let's get out of here.[groans]

00:53.521 --> 00:55.391
Whoa...

00:56.956 --> 00:58.434
Easy, easy now.
Come on...

00:58.478 --> 00:59.652
Two feet, two feet.

00:59.695 --> 01:01.304
Come on, get up.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.000
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:05.043 --> 01:07.173
Careful. All right.

01:07.217 --> 01:08.173
We're almost there.

01:08.217 --> 01:10.652
Easy...

01:10.695 --> 01:12.173
Come on, now.

01:12.217 --> 01:13.739
[grunts]
There you go.

01:15.173 --> 01:17.173
Body.

01:18.826 --> 01:20.826
Hands up.

01:22.260 --> 01:24.130
[moans quietly]

02:10.304 --> 02:12.260
Good morning, guys.

02:12.304 --> 02:14.652
Hey. You're in a good mood.

02:14.695 --> 02:15.826
ZIVA:
How can you not be?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.434
This is my favorite
time of year.

02:17.478 --> 02:20.043
The air is so crisp
and so clean.

02:20.086 --> 02:22.260
I did what I always promised
myself I would do.

02:22.304 --> 02:24.391
I... walked to work.

02:24.434 --> 02:25.173
Good for you, Ziva.

02:28.043 --> 02:29.521
What is that?

02:29.565 --> 02:31.608
Something that's gonna wipe
the smile right off your face.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.739
[inhaling deeply]

02:32.782 --> 02:35.304
Mmm! Cold case files.

02:35.347 --> 02:36.652
What am I supposed
to do with them?

02:36.695 --> 02:37.869
McGEE:
They're all pre-computerization.

02:37.913 --> 02:39.913
They need to be inputted
into the system.

02:39.956 --> 02:41.304
Well, that sounds like
a job for a clerk.

02:41.347 --> 02:43.739
[wry chuckle]
It's a big job.

02:43.782 --> 02:46.173
And each file has to
be reviewed by an agent.

02:46.217 --> 02:47.652
Why me?Vance gave it to Gibbs,

02:47.695 --> 02:48.869
Gibbs gave it to me,

02:48.913 --> 02:50.782
I'm giving it to you,
our most junior agent.

02:55.391 --> 02:58.391
How was dinner
with your father last night?

02:58.434 --> 02:59.434
Yeah,
what was

02:59.478 --> 03:00.913
the big news
he had to tell you?

03:00.956 --> 03:02.347
I don't know.
I didn't see him.

03:02.391 --> 03:03.130
He canceled?

03:03.173 --> 03:04.130
Not exactly.

03:04.173 --> 03:05.782
He never called
to tell me

03:05.826 --> 03:07.260
where to meet.

03:07.304 --> 03:08.043
Did you try and call him?

03:08.086 --> 03:09.869
Several times.

03:09.913 --> 03:11.391
This is typical

03:11.434 --> 03:14.304
of the old man--
it's his MO, if you will.

03:14.347 --> 03:15.782
My high school graduation,
for instance,

03:15.826 --> 03:17.956
I guess, technically, he would
claim he was there,

03:18.000 --> 03:19.347
but where was he really?

03:19.391 --> 03:20.782
In the school infirmary,

03:20.826 --> 03:23.782
with the nurse, with what he
claimed was "jetlag."

03:23.826 --> 03:25.391
Dad.
[chuckles]

03:25.434 --> 03:28.739
Anyway, it's not a big deal.

03:28.782 --> 03:30.521
This was dinner, so what?

03:30.565 --> 03:32.782
Wait, so-so, your father's
been in town for two days

03:32.826 --> 03:34.782
and you still have
not seen him?

03:35.956 --> 03:37.304
I'm sorry, Tony.

03:37.347 --> 03:38.521
Don't be.

03:38.565 --> 03:39.826
I stayed home.

03:39.869 --> 03:41.521
Shared a 12-year-old
bottle of Cabernet

03:41.565 --> 03:43.173
with Claire Trevor and the Duke.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.782
He watched Stagecoach.

03:46.869 --> 03:48.130
It's an old
black-and-white Western.

03:48.173 --> 03:49.304
John Wayne

03:49.347 --> 03:50.695
as the Ringo Kid.

03:50.739 --> 03:52.260
Yeah, well,
saddle up, Ringo,

03:52.304 --> 03:54.260
we got a dead Naval officer
on the riverfront.

04:02.086 --> 04:03.913
OFFICER:
It's all yours,

04:03.956 --> 04:04.739
Agent Gibbs.

04:04.782 --> 04:06.217
Body's in the trunk.

04:06.260 --> 04:07.652
Found the suspect
asleep at the wheel.

04:07.695 --> 04:09.260
This is too easy.

04:09.304 --> 04:11.043
My partner's holding him,
and for some reason

04:11.086 --> 04:13.913
he seemed relieved when he
heard we were calling NCIS.

04:13.956 --> 04:15.956
Guy's a real pain
in the ass.

04:16.782 --> 04:17.826
Junior!

04:19.608 --> 04:20.739
Thank God you're here!

04:20.782 --> 04:22.347
Dad...

04:23.608 --> 04:25.304
He was the guy
in the car?

04:25.347 --> 04:26.869
OFFICER:
Yep.

04:26.913 --> 04:28.347
Hey, hold on.

04:28.391 --> 04:29.347
Hold on.

04:29.391 --> 04:30.826
[quietly]:
It's my father.

04:30.869 --> 04:32.347
Exactly.
Get back

04:32.391 --> 04:33.826
behind the tape.

04:34.869 --> 04:36.826
You can't compromise
a crime scene.

04:38.130 --> 04:39.391
Ziva, process the scene.

04:39.434 --> 04:42.869
McGee... get the suspect
back to the Navy Yard.

04:44.608 --> 04:47.086
Uh... Junior?

04:48.217 --> 04:50.217
Watch him.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.956
McGee...

04:53.826 --> 04:54.782
What's going on?

04:54.826 --> 04:56.608
The cops won't
tell me anything.

04:56.652 --> 04:57.434
You know this guy?

04:57.478 --> 04:59.217
Yeah.

04:59.260 --> 05:01.565
Repeat offender?

05:01.608 --> 05:03.521
Will you tell
Officer Krupke here

05:03.565 --> 05:05.347
I don't have to wear these?

05:05.391 --> 05:08.391
I'm sorry,
Mr. DiNozzo, but you do.

05:20.826 --> 05:22.043
I didn't see this one coming.

05:22.086 --> 05:23.913
How could you?

05:23.956 --> 05:26.869
This is going to be
a sticky one.

05:26.913 --> 05:27.956
Blunt force trauma?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.521
Why do you need me?

05:31.956 --> 05:34.521
I'll know more when I
get him out of the trunk.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.260
[sighs]

05:56.173 --> 05:57.956
Tony...

06:02.260 --> 06:03.826
How'd it go?

06:03.869 --> 06:07.130
Vance wants me to turn
the case over to the FBI

06:07.173 --> 06:08.347
because the suspect

06:08.391 --> 06:10.086
is related to an agent-- you.

06:10.130 --> 06:12.739
I convinced him to hold off
until we know more.

06:12.782 --> 06:14.913
What did my father say?I haven't talked
to him yet.

06:14.956 --> 06:16.608
Agent Dorneget is
baby-sitting him.

06:16.652 --> 06:17.782
Dorneget?

06:17.826 --> 06:19.000
Where? Interrogation?

06:19.782 --> 06:22.391
What do we know
about the victim?

06:22.434 --> 06:23.434
ZIVA:
Lieutenant Dean Massey.Sit.

06:23.478 --> 06:24.739
University of Virginia grad.

06:24.782 --> 06:26.478
All-America rugby player.

06:26.521 --> 06:27.956
OCS at Newport.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.130
Flight training at Pensacola.
Recently divorced.

06:30.173 --> 06:31.434
No children.

06:31.478 --> 06:32.956
Divorced-- I'd
check the ex.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.391
McGEE:
Massey flew fighter jets

06:34.434 --> 06:36.434
in the Gulf War.

06:36.478 --> 06:38.347
After his active duty
was over, he became

06:38.391 --> 06:40.521
a successful,
multimillionaire
land developer,

06:40.565 --> 06:42.000
but he stayed in
the Navy Reserve

06:42.043 --> 06:44.000
so he could continue
flying supersonic aircraft.

06:44.043 --> 06:44.956
He's a reservist.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.434
He's not on
active duty.

06:46.478 --> 06:47.521
Why is he wearing a uniform?

06:47.565 --> 06:49.000
Uh, don't know yet, boss.Ziva,

06:49.043 --> 06:50.913
give me a timeline on Massey.On it.

06:50.956 --> 06:53.739
McGee said there's not even
a scratch on my father.

06:53.782 --> 06:56.434
Right? I mean, the guy's half
his age and he's a rugby player.

06:56.478 --> 06:59.434
Clearly, the guy
has been framed.

06:59.478 --> 07:00.956
That's why they parked
the car illegally,

07:01.000 --> 07:02.782
so they'd find
the body, right?

07:02.826 --> 07:05.391
Well, while wehandle
the investigation,

07:05.434 --> 07:07.521
you take care of
the cold cases.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.739
Give you any
trouble, Dorneget?

07:13.782 --> 07:15.173
Not really, sir.

07:15.217 --> 07:18.434
Keeps asking if
someone could go
back to his hotel

07:18.478 --> 07:21.086
and get him a change
of clothes.

07:21.130 --> 07:24.391
Hey, Gibbs.
Here we are again.

07:24.434 --> 07:26.695
[chuckles]
We got to stop
meeting like this.

07:26.739 --> 07:27.739
Where's Junior?

07:27.782 --> 07:29.260
On the other side of the glass?

07:29.304 --> 07:30.913
He's sitting this one out.

07:30.956 --> 07:32.260
Well, what's the fuss?

07:32.304 --> 07:34.086
I had a few drinks last night.

07:34.130 --> 07:36.043
Maybe, uh, too many.

07:36.086 --> 07:37.826
That's all I'm guilty of.

07:37.869 --> 07:40.304
Tell that to the
body in the trunk.Body?

07:40.347 --> 07:42.086
You don't know
anything about it?

07:42.130 --> 07:43.826
Uh-uh.

07:43.869 --> 07:45.000
His name is Dean Massey.

07:45.043 --> 07:46.913
Lieutenant Dean Massey.

07:46.956 --> 07:48.782
Do you know him?

07:48.826 --> 07:50.260
Massey... I'm, uh...

07:52.217 --> 07:55.869
I'm in a land development
deal with him.

07:55.913 --> 07:57.391
Tell me about it.

07:57.434 --> 08:01.391
Uh, Stoney Ridge
Country Club Estates.

08:01.434 --> 08:05.260
It's a high-end residential
golf course community.

08:05.304 --> 08:07.956
That's why I'm in D.C.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.782
What's your involvement?

08:10.826 --> 08:13.826
Well, I, uh,
introduced Massey

08:13.869 --> 08:16.434
to an old friend of mine,

08:16.478 --> 08:19.260
Prince Omar Ibn Alwaan.

08:19.304 --> 08:21.913
Oh, you-you met him,
Gibbs-- Al.

08:21.956 --> 08:24.130
Well, he brought in the
final piece of financing.

08:24.173 --> 08:25.086
You got a finder's fee?

08:25.130 --> 08:26.913
Uh, supposedly.

08:26.956 --> 08:28.260
What does that mean?

08:28.304 --> 08:30.826
Well, I, uh, met with Massey
yesterday at his office,

08:30.869 --> 08:34.782
and he informed me that he was
going to screw me out of my fee

08:34.826 --> 08:37.086
because of some loophole
in the contract.

08:37.130 --> 08:38.347
How'd you leave it with him?

08:39.739 --> 08:42.739
I threatened to kill him.

08:50.173 --> 08:53.391
I remember leaving
Massey's office.

08:53.434 --> 08:55.478
I was really
pissed off.

08:55.521 --> 08:59.695
I went back to the hotel,
I had a drink or two,

08:59.739 --> 09:03.217
and then, uh, I must have gone
someplace else and drank more.

09:03.260 --> 09:05.434
I was really hungover
this morning.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.130
Last time you saw
Massey was...

09:07.173 --> 09:08.304
In his office.

09:08.347 --> 09:09.478
It's-it's all so foggy.

09:09.521 --> 09:11.521
I-I don't
remember anything

09:11.565 --> 09:13.695
until the police
picked me up in the car.

09:13.739 --> 09:15.826
You don't have an alibi.What happens now?

09:15.869 --> 09:17.956
We've got 48 hours
to press charges or let you go.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.173
48 hours?!

09:19.217 --> 09:21.043
Gibbs, I got a
nonrefundable ticket

09:21.086 --> 09:23.217
on a plane to St. Croix
this afternoon.

09:23.260 --> 09:24.608
You got bigger problems
than that, sir.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.782
DUCKY:
At present, Tony is understating

09:31.826 --> 09:35.608
Senior's proclivity for
misguided adventures.

09:35.652 --> 09:38.130
ABBY: I always thought
Tony was exaggerating

09:38.173 --> 09:40.347
when he tells us those insane
stories about his dad.

09:40.391 --> 09:42.695
It appears to be
a sliver of glass.

09:42.739 --> 09:44.130
What do you know, Duck?

09:44.173 --> 09:46.000
Lieutenant Massey here
was killed elsewhere

09:46.043 --> 09:47.652
and then put in the car.

09:47.695 --> 09:49.130
I've narrowed
the time of death

09:49.173 --> 09:51.173
to between midnight
and 2:00 a.m.

09:51.217 --> 09:54.565
Cause of death, as suspected,
was blunt force trauma.

09:54.608 --> 09:56.869
A cylindrical wound
to the back of the head.

09:56.913 --> 09:59.086
He was likely
struck from behind.

09:59.130 --> 10:00.565
Ducky pulled this glass
fragment out of the wound.

10:00.608 --> 10:02.391
Mass Spec and I
will get to work on that,

10:02.434 --> 10:04.304
and I'm gonna look
for trace evidence

10:04.347 --> 10:05.695
on Lieutenant
Massey's uniform

10:05.739 --> 10:07.304
to see if I can figure out
where he was last night.

10:07.347 --> 10:10.565
Abbs, you got the results
of Mr. DiNozzo's blood tests?

10:10.608 --> 10:12.391
It was a standard tox screen.

10:12.434 --> 10:14.130
It came back negative.Blood alcohol?

10:14.173 --> 10:16.782
We drew the sample
at 8:30 this morning.

10:16.826 --> 10:19.000
It was .03.

10:19.043 --> 10:20.043
Which means?

10:20.086 --> 10:21.652
DUCKY: Well, for a man
of his weight,

10:21.695 --> 10:23.826
it decreases .02 each hour,

10:23.869 --> 10:26.956
so, at 2:00 a.m.,
it would have been .15.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.347
ABBY:
That's, like...

10:28.391 --> 10:30.434
really drunk.

10:30.478 --> 10:34.434
[sighs]
How is Mr. DiNozzo doing?

10:34.478 --> 10:36.043
He claims total memory loss.

10:36.086 --> 10:37.347
Well, considering his age

10:37.391 --> 10:39.391
and the amount of
alcohol he consumed,

10:39.434 --> 10:40.608
that's very possible.

10:45.869 --> 10:47.521
Hey, hey, hey,
Dorneget!

10:47.565 --> 10:48.826
Special Agent DiNozzo.

10:48.869 --> 10:50.608
Hey, brought you a
piece of cake.

10:50.652 --> 10:53.086
Hollander's birthday
in Human Resources.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.695
Thought you might
like a slice.

10:54.739 --> 10:56.782
Thanks.

10:56.826 --> 10:58.086
Sure. It's really good.

10:58.130 --> 11:00.565
The chocolate-chocolate,
with the cream filling,

11:00.608 --> 11:02.652
and there's little
crunches in it.Mmm.

11:02.695 --> 11:04.086
That's a sweet suit.

11:04.130 --> 11:05.869
Listen, I just need two
minutes with my dad, okay?

11:05.913 --> 11:07.260
Uh-uh. No way.

11:07.304 --> 11:09.347
Special Agent Gibbs told me
not to let anyone in,

11:09.391 --> 11:11.739
especially you.

11:11.782 --> 11:13.739
You didn't think you could buy
me off with a piece of cake,

11:13.782 --> 11:16.086
did you?No.

11:17.565 --> 11:19.217
Gibbs will never find out.

11:19.260 --> 11:20.565
How's he gonna know?

11:20.608 --> 11:21.826
I'd have to tell him.

11:21.869 --> 11:23.608
Well, then, I guess
I'd have to tell him

11:23.652 --> 11:26.695
about your little antics at
the Halloween party last month

11:26.739 --> 11:28.913
with Susan Grady
from Polygraph

11:28.956 --> 11:30.478
down in the copy room. Huh?

11:30.521 --> 11:32.695
She was dressed as a nun,

11:32.739 --> 11:34.913
and you were dressed
as Leroy Jethro Gibbs

11:34.956 --> 11:36.652
with a little silver wig?

11:38.521 --> 11:40.521
Nobody knew about that.

11:40.565 --> 11:45.043
I know.
DeNiro... DiNozzo.

11:45.086 --> 11:47.043
I'm watching.

11:48.521 --> 11:50.521
McGee warned me about you.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.043
Two minutes.

11:54.086 --> 11:55.086
No more.

11:55.130 --> 11:56.652
Just, please...

11:56.695 --> 11:58.086
You're a rock star.

11:58.130 --> 11:59.304
Just go.

11:59.347 --> 12:01.173
What's the matter with you?

12:01.217 --> 12:02.608
Hey, Junior.
Where you been?

12:02.652 --> 12:03.826
[sighs]
Okay.

12:03.869 --> 12:06.608
Look me in the
eye and tell me

12:06.652 --> 12:09.173
you had nothing to do
with Massey's murder.

12:09.217 --> 12:10.478
I can't.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.565
I have no recollection
of what happened.Dad!

12:12.608 --> 12:14.391
I was pissed at the guy.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.565
This was the big one.

12:15.608 --> 12:17.782
He screwed me out of
millions of dollars.

12:17.826 --> 12:20.043
Come on, it's always
"the big one" with you.

12:20.086 --> 12:21.826
This was the real thing, Junior.

12:21.869 --> 12:23.086
My retirement,
your inheritance.

12:23.130 --> 12:24.695
Where did you get
the Rolls-Royce?

12:24.739 --> 12:25.695
I rented it.

12:25.739 --> 12:27.521
You don't just pull up to close

12:27.565 --> 12:30.304
a $100 million deal
in a taxicab.

12:30.347 --> 12:31.826
Where's the Rolls now?

12:31.869 --> 12:34.608
It's in the garage, being
searched for evidence.

12:34.652 --> 12:37.000
You got to return it;
it's costing me $1,500 a day.

12:38.347 --> 12:39.521
Are you done yet?

12:39.565 --> 12:40.782
Eat your cake.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.000
Okay.

12:42.043 --> 12:44.434
I need you to stop
talking, okay?

12:44.478 --> 12:46.826
Don't say a word to anyone,
especially Gibbs,

12:46.869 --> 12:48.913
till after you've
talked to a lawyer.

12:48.956 --> 12:50.391
Does Hutch still represent you?

12:50.434 --> 12:54.739
No. We had a little, uh,
falling out over past-due fees.

12:56.869 --> 12:58.391
Dad!

13:09.521 --> 13:12.260
Lieutenant Commander
Mosner with JAG.

13:12.304 --> 13:14.304
I'm looking
for Special Agent Gibbs.He's not available

13:14.347 --> 13:15.652
at the moment.
I'm Special Agent David.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.565
This is Special
Agent McGee.

13:17.608 --> 13:19.000
How may we help you?I understand

13:19.043 --> 13:21.478
you're investigating
Lieutenant Massey's death.

13:21.521 --> 13:22.652
ZIVA:
Yes, we are.

13:22.695 --> 13:23.565
MOSNER: Massey
approached me last night,

13:23.608 --> 13:24.565
at the Navy concert.

13:24.608 --> 13:26.000
He was in uniform?Yes.

13:26.043 --> 13:27.347
Said he had information

13:27.391 --> 13:28.695
pertinent to a case
I'm prosecuting.

13:28.739 --> 13:30.478
Massey was going to
come by my office

13:30.521 --> 13:31.565
this morning
to make a statement.

13:31.608 --> 13:33.478
When he didn't show,
I called

13:33.521 --> 13:34.652
and found out he was dead.

13:34.695 --> 13:36.478
Murdered. JAG?

13:36.521 --> 13:37.478
What was the case
you were working on?

13:37.521 --> 13:39.478
Tony!
It's okay.
Please.

13:39.521 --> 13:41.043
Continue.

13:41.086 --> 13:44.217
This could be important
to ourinvestigation.

13:45.739 --> 13:49.347
Massey and another pilot,
Lieutenant Gregory Dennis,

13:49.391 --> 13:51.391
were flying in formation.

13:51.434 --> 13:53.478
Dennis' plane
experienced a problem.

13:53.521 --> 13:56.565
He and his radio officer were
forced to eject over water.

13:56.608 --> 13:58.521
Dennis survived;
the radio officer didn't.

13:58.565 --> 14:01.869
Dennis claimed the plane
had an electrical failure.

14:01.913 --> 14:03.695
And you don't think
that was the case.

14:03.739 --> 14:06.391
Massey suggested, last night,
that Dennis was lying.

14:06.434 --> 14:08.652
Thank you.

14:08.695 --> 14:10.695
VANCE: There can be
no appearance of either

14:10.739 --> 14:12.173
a cover-up or favoritism.

14:12.217 --> 14:14.260
We either have to charge him
or turn him over to the FBI.

14:14.304 --> 14:16.869
Mr. DiNozzo has done
nothing to help his case.

14:16.913 --> 14:18.739
I agree.

14:18.782 --> 14:20.260
[knocking on door]

14:20.304 --> 14:22.000
Excuse me, sir.

14:22.043 --> 14:23.304
Can I talk to you
for a second?

14:23.347 --> 14:24.391
What is it,
Agent DiNozzo?

14:24.434 --> 14:26.000
My father may be
a lot of things,

14:26.043 --> 14:27.782
but he's not a murderer.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.652
I understand where
you're coming from,

14:29.695 --> 14:32.043
but, unfortunately, we can't go
on a son's intuition.

14:32.086 --> 14:34.000
We need either evidence
or we need proof.

14:34.043 --> 14:35.043
How about reasonable doubt?

14:35.086 --> 14:36.782
There's a JAG
officer downstairs

14:36.826 --> 14:39.478
investigating a death
in an aircraft accident.

14:39.521 --> 14:41.130
Lieutenant Massey said

14:41.173 --> 14:43.086
that he had important
information regarding her case,

14:43.130 --> 14:44.391
but then he didn't
show up this morning

14:44.434 --> 14:46.000
at a scheduled meeting.

14:46.043 --> 14:47.956
Maybe he was silenced.

14:50.608 --> 14:54.000
I'll give you 24 hours,

14:54.043 --> 14:55.565
then I call
the Bureau.

14:58.652 --> 14:59.739
Thank you, sir.

14:59.782 --> 15:02.695
Under no circumstances,
Agent DiNozzo,

15:02.739 --> 15:03.956
do you go anywhere near

15:04.000 --> 15:05.739
this investigation
or your father.

15:05.782 --> 15:07.652
If need be, I suggest

15:07.695 --> 15:09.478
you take a couple
of personal days.

15:19.565 --> 15:21.347
Commander Mosner,
Special Agent Gibbs.

15:21.391 --> 15:22.652
Let's talk in
the conference room.

15:22.695 --> 15:24.130
Ziva, McGee,

15:24.173 --> 15:25.521
get over to
Massey's office.

15:26.869 --> 15:29.826
Have fun, guys!
Good luck.

15:29.869 --> 15:31.565
Don't worry
about me.

15:31.608 --> 15:35.043
I'll be right here,
inputting cold case files.

15:36.782 --> 15:38.391
MAN:
We're all in shock.

15:38.434 --> 15:40.434
Most of the employees
have been sent home early.

15:40.478 --> 15:42.826
I stayed to plan a...
a memorial for Dean.

15:42.869 --> 15:44.478
I'm sure the news
was upsetting.

15:44.521 --> 15:46.347
Can I ask?
We heard a rumor.

15:46.391 --> 15:48.695
Was Anthony DiNozzo arrested?

15:48.739 --> 15:52.043
Were you with them
in the meeting yesterday?

15:52.086 --> 15:52.913
Yes.

15:52.956 --> 15:54.478
What happened?DiNozzo

15:54.521 --> 15:57.304
came here expecting us
to hand him a check.

15:57.347 --> 15:59.478
Massey wasn't going
to let that happen.

15:59.521 --> 16:00.652
Why?Well,

16:00.695 --> 16:02.434
while it's true that
DiNozzo brought in

16:02.478 --> 16:04.043
a major piece of
the financing,

16:04.086 --> 16:06.521
the deal had to
be consummated
within one year,

16:06.565 --> 16:08.173
and it wasn't.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.782
According to a strict reading
of our contract with DiNozzo,

16:09.826 --> 16:11.652
we did not have to pay
the finder's fee.

16:11.695 --> 16:14.565
And as the company's lawyer,
I assume that was your doing.Well, no.

16:14.608 --> 16:15.739
When it came
to business,

16:15.782 --> 16:18.043
Dean Massey was ruthless.

16:18.086 --> 16:20.043
I tried to talk him
into giving DiNozzo

16:20.086 --> 16:22.478
something, but he
wouldn't budge.

16:22.521 --> 16:25.478
I even called DiNozzo
at his hotel afterward.

16:25.521 --> 16:28.521
I said, sit tight, I'd
work on Massey, but...

16:28.565 --> 16:30.695
How upset was DiNozzo
when he left?

16:30.739 --> 16:33.347
He was out of his mind.

16:34.565 --> 16:35.652
I can show you.

16:36.869 --> 16:38.173
Linda?

16:38.217 --> 16:39.608
Yes, Mr. Hunt?Oh, good, you're
still here.

16:39.652 --> 16:40.956
Could you come
into the conference room?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.347
I need your help, please.Sure.

16:42.391 --> 16:45.043
Uh, Dean Massey was
very detail oriented.

16:45.086 --> 16:47.695
I imagine it was
his military training.

16:47.739 --> 16:50.043
Every meeting in here
was recorded.

16:50.086 --> 16:52.347
Linda, could you

16:52.391 --> 16:54.739
pull up yesterday's
meeting with Mr. DiNozzo?

16:54.782 --> 16:56.043
Certainly.

16:56.086 --> 16:58.391
Was DiNozzo notified
that he was being recorded?

16:58.434 --> 16:59.521
Oh, yes.

16:59.565 --> 17:03.521
Just skip to the, uh,
last 20 seconds.

17:04.956 --> 17:06.739
Here we are.

17:06.782 --> 17:08.652
MASSEY [on video]:
This meeting's over, DiNozzo.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.608
DiNOZZO SR.:
You're a cheating bastard.

17:10.652 --> 17:13.130
You're not gonna
get away with this.

17:13.173 --> 17:14.826
MASSEY:
Yeah, sue me.

17:14.869 --> 17:16.217
DiNOZZO SR.:
Oh, I'm not gonna sue you.

17:17.565 --> 17:19.130
I'm gonna kill you!Help!

17:19.173 --> 17:20.086
Son of a bitch!Let him go! Get off him!

17:20.130 --> 17:21.652
[grunting]Security!

17:21.695 --> 17:23.913
All right!
Remove him!
Remove this man!

17:23.956 --> 17:26.652
Take it easy!Sir, you're going to
have to leave-- now.

17:34.043 --> 17:36.347
DiNOZZO, SR.:
Oh, I'm not gonna sue you...

17:36.391 --> 17:38.391
I'm gonna kill you!

17:38.434 --> 17:40.782
TONY:
He's hanging himself.

17:40.826 --> 17:42.434
Don't give up hope, Tony.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.391
I gave up hope when he started
dating girls younger than me.

17:44.434 --> 17:46.478
And that was the late '80s.

17:46.521 --> 17:47.739
I tracked down
Massey's ex-wife.

17:47.782 --> 17:48.739
It's about time.

17:48.782 --> 17:50.173
I'm on my way
to meet her.

17:50.217 --> 17:52.608
DiNOZZO SR.:
Ziva!

17:52.652 --> 17:54.913
Oh, you look ravishing as ever.

17:54.956 --> 17:57.173
Junior, when are
you gonna come

17:57.217 --> 17:59.391
to your senses

17:59.434 --> 18:01.869
and sweep this
gorgeous creature
off her feet, hmm?

18:01.913 --> 18:03.869
Dad! I'm so sorry

18:03.913 --> 18:06.086
that they didn't let me
talk to you earlier.

18:06.130 --> 18:07.956
I would ask you
how you are,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.739
but I...
Oh, minor bump
in the road.

18:09.782 --> 18:10.826
All a mistake.

18:10.869 --> 18:12.086
It'll be cleared
up soon, though.

18:12.130 --> 18:12.913
Right, Gibbs?

18:14.347 --> 18:15.391
Bye.

18:15.434 --> 18:16.739
Oh...

18:16.782 --> 18:18.739
Uh, Dorney,

18:18.782 --> 18:20.086
could you get
me a glass

18:20.130 --> 18:21.956
of water? My throat's
a little scratchy.

18:22.000 --> 18:22.913
Sure thing,
Mr. D.

18:24.173 --> 18:26.782
Gibbs, keep your eye
on that boy.

18:26.826 --> 18:27.913
Wonderful agent.

18:27.956 --> 18:29.260
I predict a big future.

18:29.304 --> 18:31.478
Well, here I am.

18:31.521 --> 18:33.695
Something must be up.

18:33.739 --> 18:34.956
We're transferring you

18:35.000 --> 18:36.130
to the Federal Detention
Center for tonight.

18:36.173 --> 18:37.521
DiNOZZO SR.:
Detention Center?

18:38.826 --> 18:40.782
I don't like the
sound of that.

18:40.826 --> 18:42.130
Well, hopefully you won't
be there for long.

18:44.086 --> 18:45.739
Why do I have the picture

18:45.782 --> 18:48.521
of a shaved-head,
tattooed neo-Nazi
cell mate?

18:48.565 --> 18:50.565
I don't think it's
gonna be that bad.

18:50.608 --> 18:51.695
Let's find out.

18:51.739 --> 18:53.000
Let's take a look.

18:53.043 --> 18:54.782
Boss, Lieutenant Dennis,
the pilot, has arrived.

18:54.826 --> 18:55.695
Bring him to Interrogation.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.956
Good Godfrey!

18:59.000 --> 19:01.434
This joint is
out of Dickens!

19:01.478 --> 19:03.000
I thought the
government closed
these places down.

19:03.043 --> 19:04.043
They were...

19:04.086 --> 19:06.130
until Congress cut
off the funds.

19:06.173 --> 19:08.565
Boss, there's got to be
some other alternative.

19:08.608 --> 19:10.000
DiNOZZO SR.:
You guys gotta be kidding.

19:12.434 --> 19:15.260
Dorneget, take Mr. DiNozzo
to the break room.

19:15.304 --> 19:16.826
Get him something to eat.Yes, sir.

19:16.869 --> 19:18.869
If he gives you any
trouble, shoot him.

19:21.304 --> 19:23.913
He's joking.

19:23.956 --> 19:25.565
I think.

19:29.652 --> 19:31.000
Why is NCIS getting involved
in an accident

19:31.043 --> 19:33.130
that's being investigated
by the Navy Safety Center?

19:33.173 --> 19:34.782
Criminal activity
and murder

19:34.826 --> 19:38.000
may have something
to do with it.

19:38.043 --> 19:42.913
Okay, my radio officer's
death was totally accidental.

19:42.956 --> 19:44.826
I'm not talking about
your radio officer.

19:44.869 --> 19:46.869
Talking about
Lieutenant Massey.

19:49.086 --> 19:50.913
What?!

19:50.956 --> 19:51.869
Massey was murdered
last night.

19:51.913 --> 19:53.956
Where were you

19:54.000 --> 19:55.086
between midnight
and 3:00 a.m.?

19:55.130 --> 19:58.739
I... On the road.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.869
I was driving back from my
parents' home in Georgia.

20:01.913 --> 20:02.913
In the middle of the night?

20:02.956 --> 20:05.913
Don't like traffic.

20:05.956 --> 20:07.000
We'll check it out.

20:07.043 --> 20:08.652
Go ahead.

20:08.695 --> 20:09.782
Lieutenant Massey

20:09.826 --> 20:11.086
approached a JAG prosecutor,

20:11.130 --> 20:12.956
who said that you weren't
telling the truth

20:13.000 --> 20:14.217
about the accident.

20:14.260 --> 20:15.391
That's crazy.

20:15.434 --> 20:17.565
You spoke to
Massey recently?

20:17.608 --> 20:20.565
[clears throat]

20:20.608 --> 20:23.130
I'm not saying any more
until I consult my lawyer.

20:27.913 --> 20:30.913
So, when was the last time
you saw your ex-husband?

20:30.956 --> 20:32.521
Months ago.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.173
We've been divorced
almost four years.

20:34.217 --> 20:35.086
You keep in touch?

20:35.130 --> 20:36.739
No reason to.

20:36.782 --> 20:39.000
Maybe if we'd had kids.

20:39.043 --> 20:40.608
I wanted them, he didn't.

20:40.652 --> 20:41.826
That why you got divorced?

20:41.869 --> 20:45.130
That and... the fact
we just grew apart.

20:45.173 --> 20:46.739
The marriage was over
when I realized

20:46.782 --> 20:48.565
I was my husband's third love.

20:48.608 --> 20:51.869
His first two were making money
and flying military jets.

20:51.913 --> 20:53.173
Sorry.

20:53.217 --> 20:54.391
Don't be.

20:54.434 --> 20:56.739
The early years of our
marriage were happy.

20:56.782 --> 20:57.869
He loved the Navy,

20:57.913 --> 20:59.739
and I loved being
a Navy wife.

20:59.782 --> 21:01.782
We lived on bases
all around the world.

21:01.826 --> 21:04.304
I got to see places I
never dreamed I would,

21:04.347 --> 21:05.608
and he was off flying.

21:05.652 --> 21:06.869
What happened?

21:06.913 --> 21:08.913
MAN:
There you go; put it
right there, son.

21:08.956 --> 21:09.913
Thank you.

21:09.956 --> 21:11.391
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

21:11.434 --> 21:14.217
After Dean left active duty,

21:14.260 --> 21:16.652
he went into real
estate development.

21:16.695 --> 21:18.608
He became obsessed

21:18.652 --> 21:20.652
with making money.

21:20.695 --> 21:23.565
He wasn't the man
I married.

21:23.608 --> 21:25.826
Yeah, we were told he was
ruthless in business.

21:25.869 --> 21:29.565
Must have made your divorce
settlement, um, difficult.

21:29.608 --> 21:33.565
I had a good lawyer,
and I made out okay.

21:33.608 --> 21:37.652
I'm financially set
for the rest of my life.

21:37.695 --> 21:40.652
I have no future
claim on his estate,

21:40.695 --> 21:42.652
if that's what
you're wondering.

21:42.695 --> 21:45.739
With his death,
who gets his money?

21:45.782 --> 21:47.173
I have no idea.

21:47.217 --> 21:50.434
You should talk to
Morgan Hunt, his lawyer.

21:58.130 --> 22:00.521
Hey, Abby!

22:00.565 --> 22:01.826
Oh, McGee.

22:01.869 --> 22:04.043
Have you ever been in
a Rolls-Royce before?

22:04.086 --> 22:07.086
The leather smells so good...

22:07.130 --> 22:10.043
and it's soft, like butter.

22:10.086 --> 22:11.478
Get in.

22:15.217 --> 22:16.652
Ooh.

22:16.695 --> 22:18.565
[sighs]

22:18.608 --> 22:20.043
Ooh.

22:20.086 --> 22:22.869
Nice.

22:22.913 --> 22:24.826
Nice.

22:24.869 --> 22:27.347
So, you find anything?

22:27.391 --> 22:28.826
I downloaded
the nav-system

22:28.869 --> 22:31.173
to try to find out
where the car has been.

22:31.217 --> 22:34.043
But Tony's dad never
turned it on.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.782
It's an age thing.

22:35.826 --> 22:37.739
You don't think
that Senior

22:37.782 --> 22:39.391
could actually kill
anybody, do you?

22:39.434 --> 22:41.652
Well, Gibbs said
to remain objective.

22:41.695 --> 22:43.391
I suggest you
do the same.

22:43.434 --> 22:46.043
That's getting
a little hard.
Why?

22:46.086 --> 22:51.043
Well, Senior said that
he only drove the car

22:51.086 --> 22:53.434
from the rental place
to the meeting

22:53.478 --> 22:55.043
and then to the hotel.

22:55.086 --> 22:56.826
But then, when I
compared the mileage

22:56.869 --> 22:59.521
on the odometer to
the rental agreement,

22:59.565 --> 23:03.608
he drove 122 miles.

23:03.652 --> 23:05.782
Where else did he go?

23:07.913 --> 23:09.565
Here, come here.

23:09.608 --> 23:11.826
I'm going back over
the trace evidence
from the car

23:11.869 --> 23:13.652
to try to figure out
where the murder occurred.

23:13.695 --> 23:15.565
Lieutenant Massey
had stains on his jacket

23:15.608 --> 23:18.043
and his pants that
tested to be red wine.

23:18.086 --> 23:22.391
The fragment Ducky pulled
from his skull, it is glass.

23:22.434 --> 23:26.043
Magnified, you can see
the striations.

23:26.086 --> 23:28.391
It was hand-blown,
and it was stretched.

23:28.434 --> 23:31.304
If I were a betting man,
which I am not,

23:31.347 --> 23:33.913
I would wager that
Lieutenant Massey

23:33.956 --> 23:38.043
was bludgeoned with
a bottle of vintage wine.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.826
This is Dean's will.

23:48.869 --> 23:50.782
I'm filing it
with the court tomorrow,

23:50.826 --> 23:53.304
and I can get you
a copy after that.

23:53.347 --> 23:54.739
But it's-it's pretty simple.

23:54.782 --> 23:56.913
All his assets
are placed in trust.

23:56.956 --> 23:57.869
Who is the beneficiary?

23:57.913 --> 23:59.869
The Navy.
The Navy?

23:59.913 --> 24:02.521
The proceeds go to
various Navy charities.

24:02.565 --> 24:03.695
Hospitals,

24:03.739 --> 24:07.913
veterans' organizations,
scholarship funds.

24:07.956 --> 24:10.260
The Navy was his life.

24:10.304 --> 24:12.695
Hmm.

24:18.565 --> 24:19.782
Hey, McGee.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.478
Hey, Tony.

24:22.521 --> 24:24.782
Bring me up to speed.

24:24.826 --> 24:25.956
No way, Tony.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.304
You know
that I can't talk to you.

24:28.347 --> 24:29.739
Don't make me hurt you.

24:29.782 --> 24:32.521
If I say anything to you,
Gibbs will kill me.

24:32.565 --> 24:34.826
Okay, I get it.

24:34.869 --> 24:36.000
I just...

24:36.043 --> 24:37.217
Hey, oh.

24:37.260 --> 24:39.782
Hey, give that back.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.000
Come on, give it back,
give it back!

24:41.043 --> 24:44.869
Give it back! Come on!
Give it back! Back...

24:47.000 --> 24:48.913
Hi, Jen.

24:50.869 --> 24:53.173
Can you put a BOLO
out on a Porsche?

24:55.608 --> 24:56.956
Is it Massey's?

24:57.000 --> 24:58.608
Yes. We checked out
his residence.

24:58.652 --> 25:01.347
There was no sign of a struggle,
but one of his cars was missing.

25:01.391 --> 25:02.695
You track Massey's
whereabouts last night?

25:02.739 --> 25:04.043
Where he went after
the Navy concert?

25:04.086 --> 25:05.391
Tony, I'm not
telling you anymore.

25:05.434 --> 25:06.695
You check Senior's
hotel room?

25:06.739 --> 25:08.434
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
I cannot hear you, Tony.

25:08.478 --> 25:12.217
Listen, this is my father, Tim.

25:12.260 --> 25:13.782
Just give me something.

25:18.086 --> 25:21.130
Your father's room was clear.

25:21.173 --> 25:23.869
The pilot, Lieutenant Dennis--
did his alibi check out?

25:23.913 --> 25:25.130
Tony, you have to realize

25:25.173 --> 25:27.260
that we are working
every angle possible.

25:27.304 --> 25:29.695
But we're one very
special agent short.

25:34.782 --> 25:36.869
One more thing.

25:36.913 --> 25:38.173
Where did Dennis
claim to be?

25:38.217 --> 25:39.869
Because I...

25:39.913 --> 25:41.739
Tim, I told you
Gibbs and Vance told me

25:41.782 --> 25:44.043
to stay away
from the case. Sorry.

25:48.304 --> 25:49.826
DiNOZZO SR.:
Not too tight, Dorney.

25:50.913 --> 25:53.043
Hey, Junior, where you been?

25:53.086 --> 25:55.086
What's going on here?Your boss is a
real sweetheart.

25:55.130 --> 25:56.521
Came up with a way
to keep me out

25:56.565 --> 25:57.739
of the slammer for the night.

25:57.782 --> 25:58.869
GPS monitor?

25:58.913 --> 26:00.565
Yes, sir.

26:00.608 --> 26:02.000
Where are you spending
the night?

26:03.304 --> 26:05.130
My place.

26:24.043 --> 26:26.782
Where you going, Chief?

26:28.739 --> 26:30.695
What's the matter, Gibbs?

26:30.739 --> 26:32.695
Don't trust me?

26:32.739 --> 26:34.652
Standing watch?

26:34.695 --> 26:36.478
No. No, I always rack here.

26:37.478 --> 26:39.695
I had trouble sleeping.

26:39.739 --> 26:42.913
I thought I'd, uh,
get a glass of milk,

26:42.956 --> 26:44.304
or something stronger.

26:44.347 --> 26:46.521
[sighs]

26:46.565 --> 26:49.521
Well, I'll warm up
some milk for you.

26:49.565 --> 26:50.652
Yeah, right.

26:50.695 --> 26:53.217
Booze is what got
me into this mess.

26:53.260 --> 26:54.652
You have low-fat?

26:56.043 --> 26:57.478
Whole milk will be great.

26:58.652 --> 27:01.391
I don't mean
to be uncooperative, Gibbs.

27:01.434 --> 27:04.478
It's, uh, just that
I was so loaded

27:04.521 --> 27:07.782
last night
that I don't remember anything.

27:10.652 --> 27:15.695
You think there's a chance
I killed Massey?

27:16.652 --> 27:21.043
The funny thing is,
I could always hold my liquor.

27:23.782 --> 27:25.608
[sighs]

27:25.652 --> 27:28.478
I know you and I haven't been
the best of friends

27:28.521 --> 27:30.782
for the past couple years,
but, uh...

27:32.434 --> 27:34.478
...why'd you stick
your neck out for me?

27:34.521 --> 27:35.695
Let me stay here?

27:35.739 --> 27:37.695
I didn't do it for you.

27:38.913 --> 27:40.478
I did it for your son.

27:45.913 --> 27:47.782
He deserves better.

27:51.913 --> 27:53.869
You're right, Gibbs.

27:53.913 --> 27:55.869
He does.

27:55.913 --> 27:59.478
I thought that
when this deal went through,

27:59.521 --> 28:03.521
I'd be set;
I could retire.

28:03.565 --> 28:06.521
No more hustling.

28:06.565 --> 28:11.000
I'd be able to be the person
I always pretended to be.

28:11.043 --> 28:14.304
Leave some money
for Junior.

28:14.347 --> 28:16.130
Real money.

28:16.173 --> 28:18.391
You don't get it.

28:18.434 --> 28:20.434
Tony never
wanted your money.

28:23.565 --> 28:27.043
He wants a father.

28:27.086 --> 28:29.086
[sighs]

28:32.521 --> 28:34.739
DUCKY:
Ah, you're looking

28:34.782 --> 28:36.739
much better, Anthony.

28:36.782 --> 28:40.565
Nothing like a warm shower
and clean change of clothes.

28:41.695 --> 28:44.565
May I assume that you've worked

28:44.608 --> 28:46.782
on living, breathing bodies
before, Doc?

28:46.826 --> 28:48.652
[chuckles]
Once or twice.

28:52.173 --> 28:53.956
Do we have to do this again?

28:54.000 --> 28:55.956
Abby already drew blood.

28:56.000 --> 28:59.217
That was for blood alcohol
and a standard tox screen.

28:59.260 --> 29:01.391
Gibbs wants a full panel.

29:01.434 --> 29:02.478
Oh, but, uh,

29:02.521 --> 29:04.652
let's start with this, shall we?

29:04.695 --> 29:08.565
Uh, there's a restroom
just around the corner.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.217
I can handle this
myself, Dorney.

29:25.304 --> 29:27.652
How'd it go with my father
last night?

29:29.217 --> 29:30.478
Where is he?

29:30.521 --> 29:31.608
Autopsy.

29:31.652 --> 29:33.478
You shot him.

29:33.521 --> 29:35.000
Can't say I blame you.

29:36.521 --> 29:38.521
Well, you guys obviously
put the fear of God

29:38.565 --> 29:39.956
into Lieutenant Dennis.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.652
His lawyer called last night.
He wants to make a deal.

29:41.695 --> 29:42.826
He confessed?

29:42.869 --> 29:44.434
Yes, but not
to Lieutenant Massey's murder.

29:44.478 --> 29:45.956
He swears
he had nothing to do with it.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.478
His alibi checked out.
McGEE:
We got tollbooth

29:47.521 --> 29:48.782
video and SmartPasses

29:48.826 --> 29:50.521
[phone ringing]confirming his timeline.

29:50.565 --> 29:52.130
Special Agent McGee.

29:52.173 --> 29:54.521
Dennis came clean
on the aircraft incident.

29:54.565 --> 29:56.826
It was pilot error.
He was hotdogging.

29:56.869 --> 29:59.913
He even provided us with a
cockpit recording he was hiding.

29:59.956 --> 30:01.521
Thanks.

30:01.565 --> 30:03.478
Virginia State Police found
Massey's Porsche.

30:03.521 --> 30:07.608
Where?
On a back road at the
Stoney Ridge development.

30:07.652 --> 30:09.565
Things keeps getting worse
for my old man.

30:09.608 --> 30:10.739
Ziva, McGee. Go.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.391
Hey.

30:29.434 --> 30:31.347
Abbs, Gibbs sent me
down to find out,

30:31.391 --> 30:33.217
uh, what you found out.

30:33.260 --> 30:34.695
What are you talking about?

30:34.739 --> 30:37.652
You know, that thing
you're working on for him.Tony,

30:37.695 --> 30:40.130
I'm not telling you anything
about your father's case.

30:40.173 --> 30:41.304
My lips are sealed.

30:41.347 --> 30:42.913
Oh, come on.
I mean, I'm just doing...

30:42.956 --> 30:44.782
I'm desperate, Abby.

30:44.826 --> 30:48.173
I'm sorry.

30:48.217 --> 30:51.173
Now leave,
and consider yourself banished.

30:53.652 --> 30:54.826
What's this?

30:54.869 --> 30:56.478
Your father's urine.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.521
I'm going.

31:00.652 --> 31:03.434
I heard Massey was bludgeoned
with a vintage bottle of wine.

31:03.478 --> 31:04.652
There were stains
on his uniform.

31:04.695 --> 31:06.478
I'm not helping you.Was it a Bordeaux?

31:06.521 --> 31:07.652
Out!

31:24.478 --> 31:26.521
ZIVA:
McGee! Over here!

31:31.086 --> 31:34.043
What you got?

31:34.086 --> 31:36.173
Could be the murder weapon.

31:40.434 --> 31:42.086
[sighs]

31:42.130 --> 31:46.434
Like father, like son.

31:46.478 --> 31:49.086
Only person I
ever saw mix decaf

31:49.130 --> 31:50.782
and regular like this is Tony.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.086
Really?

31:52.130 --> 31:54.695
You guys look alike,
have the same mannerisms.

31:54.739 --> 31:56.521
You must be really close.

31:56.565 --> 31:59.173
He's very
concerned about you.

32:00.217 --> 32:02.521
You close with your father?

32:02.565 --> 32:04.304
He died
just before my first birthday.

32:04.347 --> 32:06.478
Oh. I'm sorry.

32:06.521 --> 32:08.608
He was a Detroit cop.

32:08.652 --> 32:10.956
Got killed in a
traffic accident.

32:13.478 --> 32:15.434
Hey, Junior,
where have you been?

32:15.478 --> 32:17.000
Dorneget, take five.

32:17.043 --> 32:18.782
Sir, we're out
in the open, and

32:18.826 --> 32:20.521
if Gibbs comes
by, I'm dead.

32:20.565 --> 32:22.478
Junior, we have no secrets
from Dorney.

32:27.608 --> 32:30.782
Well, it's not looking good,
Dad. Now,

32:30.826 --> 32:33.130
the family bottle of wine--
did you bring it to DC?

32:33.173 --> 32:35.217
How'd you know?
[sighs]

32:35.260 --> 32:36.608
You like fine wine?

32:36.652 --> 32:38.608
I don't drink, sir.Of course you don't.

32:38.652 --> 32:40.608
1968 ChatÃªau Auclair.

32:40.652 --> 32:43.521
I bought it the year
that Junior was born.

32:43.565 --> 32:44.869
Must be worth a fortune by now.

32:44.913 --> 32:46.434
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

32:46.478 --> 32:48.956
Dad, there is a good chance

32:49.000 --> 32:51.826
that that bottle was used
as the murder weapon.

32:57.652 --> 33:02.391
Junior...
did I kill him?

33:02.434 --> 33:03.652
Where's that bottle now?

33:03.695 --> 33:07.000
The last time I saw it,
it was in the Rolls.

33:07.043 --> 33:09.608
I was taking the wine
to the restaurant

33:09.652 --> 33:12.434
to celebrate the closing
of the deal with you.

33:12.478 --> 33:14.652
Well, what restaurant?
Because you never told me.

33:14.695 --> 33:17.217
I was gonna take you
to Halligan's Pub for a drink,

33:17.260 --> 33:19.652
and then to the Adams House
for a rib-eye.

33:19.695 --> 33:21.000
Did you go to either place?

33:23.521 --> 33:25.565
Maybe.

33:25.608 --> 33:27.695
I don't know.

33:27.739 --> 33:29.608
Okay. All right.

33:33.608 --> 33:35.521
[sighs]

33:36.565 --> 33:39.565
What have you got?

33:39.608 --> 33:42.608
Found the
murder weapon.

33:42.652 --> 33:45.304
ABBY:
The traces of blood on the
bottle match the victim.

33:45.347 --> 33:46.956
It's pricey.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.347
Tire tracks found at the crime
scene belong to the Rolls-Royce.

33:49.391 --> 33:51.652
Anything else?

33:57.608 --> 34:01.956
I got an AFIS match
on a right thumbprint

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
off the bottle.

34:06.478 --> 34:09.521
VANCE:
We got motive,

34:09.565 --> 34:12.565
we got means
and opportunity.

34:14.608 --> 34:16.608
It's time to book him.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.130
Good job.

34:36.043 --> 34:38.000
FBI's on the way.

34:38.043 --> 34:39.130
I'm sure you want

34:39.173 --> 34:41.173
to see Tony,
but we can't find him.

34:42.521 --> 34:43.478
[phone clicks
onto receiver]

34:43.521 --> 34:45.086
McGEE:
Called his cell again, boss.

34:45.130 --> 34:46.086
It's turned off.

34:46.130 --> 34:48.260
No one has any idea where he is?

34:48.304 --> 34:50.304
Hi.

34:51.913 --> 34:55.217
Sorry. We're not open
till 5:00, my friend.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.478
NCIS. Special Agent DiNozzo.

34:57.521 --> 34:58.347
DiNozzo?

34:58.391 --> 35:00.043
[laughs]
Look at you.

35:00.086 --> 35:02.478
You got to be
Anthony's kid, huh?

35:02.521 --> 35:03.695
Yeah.
Yeah?

35:03.739 --> 35:05.304
You know him?One of my favorites.

35:05.347 --> 35:07.260
Comes in whenever
he's in town.

35:07.304 --> 35:09.000
Was he here a
couple nights ago?

35:09.043 --> 35:11.217
Yeah. Is he all right?

35:11.260 --> 35:13.391
I was worried about him.

35:13.434 --> 35:16.391
Why?
Well, usually
he can hold his liquor,

35:16.434 --> 35:17.652
but, uh, the other night,

35:17.695 --> 35:19.695
he had a couple
of drinks, and...

35:19.739 --> 35:23.304
he got wasted, and, uh,
I was going to call a cab,

35:23.347 --> 35:24.913
but then, uh,

35:24.956 --> 35:27.130
this lady that he picked up

35:27.173 --> 35:29.739
offered to drive him
back to his hotel

35:29.782 --> 35:31.391
in his car, and, uh...

35:31.434 --> 35:33.304
[chuckles]
He may be getting up there,

35:33.347 --> 35:35.521
but he's still got
a way with the women.

35:35.565 --> 35:37.695
This woman that he left
with-- do you know her?

35:37.739 --> 35:38.956
Never saw her before.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.304
Can you describe her?

35:40.347 --> 35:42.869
Attractive.
A lot younger than him.

35:42.913 --> 35:45.347
Um... forties, I'd guess.

35:45.391 --> 35:48.304
You have video surveillance
in here?

35:48.347 --> 35:50.173
Uh, yeah,
who doesn't these days?

35:50.217 --> 35:51.347
Right up there
in the corner.

35:51.391 --> 35:53.304
Great. I'm going to need
to see it.

35:53.347 --> 35:56.173
Let's go.

36:08.217 --> 36:12.434
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait! Wait!

36:12.478 --> 36:13.869
Oh, my God.

36:13.913 --> 36:15.130
Oh.
I'm so glad
you're still here.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.478
[Abby sighs]

36:16.521 --> 36:17.956
I don't think
you killed anyone.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.478
Really? Well...

36:20.521 --> 36:21.869
Don't take him anywhere!

36:21.913 --> 36:23.478
I have no idea who you are,
lady, but we're leaving.

36:23.521 --> 36:24.652
Hey!

36:24.695 --> 36:26.000
Hold up.
ABBY:
Gibbs,

36:26.043 --> 36:27.565
I ran specific tox screens

36:27.608 --> 36:28.956
for several sedatives

36:29.000 --> 36:30.347
and benzodiazepines.

36:30.391 --> 36:31.478
I got a hit.

36:31.521 --> 36:32.521
Flunitrazepam.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.347
McGEE:
A roofie.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.565
The date-rape drug.

36:34.608 --> 36:36.217
Date rape?

36:36.260 --> 36:37.347
Mr. DiNozzo's fingerprints

36:37.391 --> 36:39.260
were only on the
barrel of the bottle,

36:39.304 --> 36:40.608
not on the neck,
where you would

36:40.652 --> 36:42.391
grip it if you were gonna
use it as a weapon.

36:42.434 --> 36:45.565
That part was
suspiciously wiped clean.

36:45.608 --> 36:47.173
[phone ringing]

36:47.217 --> 36:48.260
Special Agent McGee.

36:49.478 --> 36:51.347
Boss, it's Tony.
Tony, where are you?

36:51.391 --> 36:52.347
TONY:
Never mind where I am.

36:52.391 --> 36:53.478
I'm e-mailing you a photo

36:53.521 --> 36:55.260
of a woman
my father left a bar with.

36:55.304 --> 36:57.391
I need you to I.D. her.

37:01.913 --> 37:04.739
Come here.

37:06.608 --> 37:09.478
You know her?

37:10.913 --> 37:12.956
She's attractive.

37:14.695 --> 37:17.391
I have absolutely
no idea who she is.

37:17.434 --> 37:19.130
She works at Massey's company.

37:20.652 --> 37:22.521
Take off the cuffs.

37:22.565 --> 37:24.739
You heard him.

37:36.391 --> 37:38.391
Linda?

37:41.391 --> 37:43.217
I've been told
we've met before.

37:43.260 --> 37:45.304
Strange,

37:45.347 --> 37:47.043
I usually remember
a pretty face.

37:47.086 --> 37:48.304
GIBBS:
We know that

37:48.347 --> 37:49.478
you left the bar with him

37:49.521 --> 37:51.217
night before last.

37:51.260 --> 37:53.304
Did you slip me a roofie?

37:53.347 --> 37:54.739
ZIVA:
Is there

37:54.782 --> 37:55.739
a place we can talk?

37:55.782 --> 37:58.782
Yes.

38:05.304 --> 38:07.739
GIBBS:
You're at least an accomplice
to Dean Massey's murder.

38:07.782 --> 38:10.347
I was told
no one would get hurt.

38:10.391 --> 38:11.347
Who told you that?

38:13.869 --> 38:16.434
Morgan Hunt.

38:18.347 --> 38:20.217
What's going to happen to me?

38:20.260 --> 38:22.173
Depends how cooperative you are.

38:22.217 --> 38:25.478
I'd been working here
for about a year

38:25.521 --> 38:27.739
before Morgan and I started
seeing each another.

38:27.782 --> 38:31.130
We kept it quiet, but it
started getting serious.

38:31.173 --> 38:32.956
We talked about marriage.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.217
What happened?

38:34.260 --> 38:37.000
After the incident
with Mr. DiNozzo,

38:37.043 --> 38:38.782
Morgan came to my
office and told me

38:38.826 --> 38:40.913
that Mr. Massey was gonna try
to shaft him, too.

38:40.956 --> 38:42.217
How?

38:42.260 --> 38:43.434
Their confrontation's recorded.

38:43.478 --> 38:45.565
As you know, every
meeting in this room is.

38:45.608 --> 38:48.521
Morgan asked me to erase
his argument with Mr. Massey.

38:48.565 --> 38:49.478
Did you?

38:49.521 --> 38:51.521
Yes.

38:51.565 --> 38:53.173
But I kept

38:53.217 --> 38:54.608
a protective copy for myself,

38:54.652 --> 38:57.739
just in case either of them
tried to mess with me.

38:57.782 --> 38:59.782
I thought I was dealing
with reputable people.

38:59.826 --> 39:01.521
There's no one
you can trust here.

39:01.565 --> 39:02.913
Where's the copy?

39:02.956 --> 39:04.043
On a flash drive in my office.

39:04.086 --> 39:05.521
Get it.
Ziva, go with her.

39:20.173 --> 39:22.304
Going someplace, Morgan?

39:22.347 --> 39:24.739
[grunting]

39:26.434 --> 39:28.391
Teamwork.

39:30.043 --> 39:31.304
Just like you and Junior.

39:33.304 --> 39:35.347
GIBBS:
Coming up is what

39:35.391 --> 39:37.739
Morgan Hunt instructed
his girlfriend to delete.

39:37.782 --> 39:40.260
You know what? I think I'm gonna
be just as tough with you.

39:40.304 --> 39:41.565
What are you talking about?

39:41.608 --> 39:43.826
MASSEY:
Your employment
contract's expired.

39:43.869 --> 39:45.739
I'm not renewing it.

39:45.782 --> 39:47.391
I've found a new lawyer.

39:47.434 --> 39:49.565
He's younger, more aggressive.

39:49.608 --> 39:53.304
I'm also removing you
as the executor of my estate.

39:53.347 --> 39:55.304
You bastard.

40:00.608 --> 40:02.565
GIBBS:
The Navy gets the proceeds

40:02.608 --> 40:04.521
of Massey's estate,
but the executor fees

40:04.565 --> 40:06.043
that Hunt stood to collect

40:06.086 --> 40:07.739
would be north
of seven figures a year.

40:07.782 --> 40:09.173
That sounds like a motive.

40:09.217 --> 40:11.086
Hunt's secretary confessed
to drugging DiNozzo

40:11.130 --> 40:12.652
and driving him out
to the golf course.

40:12.695 --> 40:16.173
Hunt lured Massey out there,
killed him with the wine bottle.

40:16.217 --> 40:17.913
So, how do we handle
our predicament?

40:17.956 --> 40:19.608
What predicament?

40:19.652 --> 40:22.000
Agent DiNozzo disobeyed
direct orders from both of us.

40:22.043 --> 40:24.913
He stuck his nose in the case.
What are you gonna do?

40:24.956 --> 40:26.260
Ignore it.

40:26.304 --> 40:27.652
That's what I figured.

40:28.913 --> 40:30.478
Gibbs?Yeah.

40:32.086 --> 40:33.043
Hey.

40:33.086 --> 40:35.434
Hey.

40:38.043 --> 40:39.478
[grunts]

40:39.521 --> 40:40.826
What's the matter?

40:40.869 --> 40:43.304
My old man did it again.

40:43.347 --> 40:46.043
I went by the hotel
to see him...

40:46.086 --> 40:48.434
he's gone. Checked out.

40:48.478 --> 40:49.913
Did I get a phone call?

40:49.956 --> 40:51.391
No-ho-ho-ho.

40:51.434 --> 40:53.217
Didn't even tell me.

40:53.260 --> 40:54.391
Shouldn't be surprised.

40:54.434 --> 40:58.000
What am I gonna do
with that guy?

40:58.043 --> 40:59.913
He makes me crazy!

41:02.304 --> 41:04.130
[sighs]

41:06.391 --> 41:07.956
I should be really
pissed off with him.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.913
Mm-hmm. So why aren't you?

41:13.478 --> 41:16.130
I really thought I was gonna
lose him there for a second.

41:17.304 --> 41:19.913
And as crazy as he makes me...

41:22.391 --> 41:24.739
I do love the guy.

41:29.260 --> 41:32.782
The pathetic thing is I've
never been able to tell him.

41:32.826 --> 41:34.347
Mmm.

41:34.391 --> 41:35.739
Consider it done, Junior.

41:39.956 --> 41:42.565
Dad, what are you doing here?

41:42.608 --> 41:44.478
Well, when the deal fell
through,

41:44.521 --> 41:45.913
I couldn't afford the hotel,

41:45.956 --> 41:48.478
and Gibbs offered me a room.

41:52.086 --> 41:53.782
You're staying in town?

41:53.826 --> 41:55.695
Thursday is Thanksgiving.

41:55.739 --> 41:57.434
I wanted to be with you.

42:05.695 --> 42:07.869
Do something with this, Junior.
