of Manhattan's elite.

You'll never believe
what's on "Gossip Girl."

00:07.094 --> 00:08.051
[Isabel]
Someone saw Serena getting off

00:08.138 --> 00:09.357
the train at Grand Central.

00:09.444 --> 00:10.706
I thought everything
was good between us.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.012
It was, before I found out

00:12.099 --> 00:13.274
you had sex with my boyfriend.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.362
I didn't come back for you.

00:14.449 --> 00:15.841
Look, Blair's my best friend

00:15.928 --> 00:17.974
and you're her boyfriend,
and she loves you.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.367
You'd really go out
with some guy you don't know?

00:19.454 --> 00:21.325
Well, he can't be worse
than the guys I do know.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.892
If you wanna be a part
of this world, Jenny

00:22.979 --> 00:25.677
you need to decide
if all this is worth it.

00:25.764 --> 00:26.809
[Jenny]
Get off. Stop.

00:26.896 --> 00:27.940
Hey!

00:28.028 --> 00:29.812
That is my little sister!

00:29.899 --> 00:32.815
Bendel's is interested
in carrying my line.

00:32.902 --> 00:34.686
'Cause more people
should be like you, mother.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.427
Eleanor Waldorf is gearing up

00:36.514 --> 00:38.473
to take her company public,
and I've been courting her

00:38.560 --> 00:40.127
for months, so let
me handle the deal.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.519
- Then you should get it.
- I willget it.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.130
If you just help me
out a little bit.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.178
Opposites do attract

00:48.265 --> 00:49.440
but for how long?

00:50.659 --> 00:51.921
[indistinct whispering]

00:52.008 --> 00:53.444
And who am I?

00:53.531 --> 00:55.316
That's one secret
I'll never tell.

00:55.403 --> 00:56.882
[theme music]

00:56.969 --> 00:58.580
You know you love me.

00:58.667 --> 01:01.539
XOXO. Gossip Girl.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.499
Long ago, when European royals

01:04.586 --> 01:06.501
grew bored with palace balls

01:06.588 --> 01:08.024
they took a page from the peons

01:08.111 --> 01:09.852
and added some pageantry.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.114
Couture and canape

01:11.201 --> 01:12.898
are just another Saturday night

01:12.985 --> 01:14.813
until you add a mask.

01:14.900 --> 01:15.945
But preparing for a ball

01:16.032 --> 01:17.773
is an event in itself

01:17.860 --> 01:20.428
which is why queens
invented handmaidens.

01:20.515 --> 01:21.777
So the dresses
should be delivered

01:21.864 --> 01:23.170
and I'll take
the small stuff with me.

01:23.257 --> 01:24.649
Which one's yours?

01:24.736 --> 01:26.956
Oh, no. I'm just helping Blair.

01:27.043 --> 01:29.132
But I mean, you know, we'll see.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.003
Well...here's hoping.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.967
We'll put it on Blair's tab.

01:38.054 --> 01:39.142
Oh, no, no, no.

01:39.229 --> 01:40.448
The girls at that party

01:40.535 --> 01:42.102
are my best customers.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.886
Why not show off
my latest wares?

01:43.973 --> 01:46.018
'Just return it after the ball.'

01:46.106 --> 01:47.150
[Serena]
So Kati mentioned something

01:47.237 --> 01:48.630
about a custom-made corset

01:48.717 --> 01:50.284
and I hear there
are wigs involved?

01:50.371 --> 01:51.459
It's a masquerade.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.243
You have to conceal
your identity.

01:53.330 --> 01:56.420
But I do have something special
planned for Nate tonight.

01:56.507 --> 01:58.944
It's a game.
It's a scavenger hunt.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.772
Nate starts the night
with a clue..

02:00.859 --> 02:02.339
...which leads him
to a lady in waiting

02:02.426 --> 02:03.688
who gives him a clue
to the next lady--

02:03.775 --> 02:04.950
Wait. Hold on.
You have ladies now?

02:05.037 --> 02:06.387
If he finds me before midnight

02:06.474 --> 02:07.997
when the masks come off..

02:08.084 --> 02:09.129
...he can claim his prize.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.305
And what's that?

02:11.392 --> 02:12.828
Oh.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.917
Yeah, right. Sorry.

02:15.004 --> 02:16.353
[chuckles]

02:16.440 --> 02:18.138
I just figured that..

02:18.225 --> 02:20.270
...after everything
that's happened..

02:20.357 --> 02:23.752
...or...hasn't happened..

02:23.839 --> 02:26.842
...I should find some
way to make it special.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.453
Well, that's really
romantic, Blair.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.672
Really.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.110
Look, um, if you don't want me

02:34.197 --> 02:35.633
to come tonight,
I totally understand.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.721
- 'I could just--'
- What?

02:36.808 --> 02:39.420
No, I want you to come.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.464
In fact, I was hoping

02:40.551 --> 02:42.553
you'd be one of my ladies.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.338
Would you give Nate
the last clue?

02:44.425 --> 02:46.818
Well, are you sure
you want me to?

02:46.905 --> 02:48.820
Tonight is all
about starting over.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.607
I trust you...and him.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.828
Well, then I
will be honored

02:56.915 --> 02:58.221
to serve you, my queen.

02:59.831 --> 03:02.356
Well, besides, you're
bringing Dan, right?

03:02.443 --> 03:04.096
- A ball?
- Haven't you heard?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.403
Your sister's Cinderella.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.493
And let me guess. Your wicked
stepsister is Blair Waldorf.

03:09.580 --> 03:10.842
Blair may have
asked me to do

03:10.929 --> 03:12.235
a few things,
but I'm happy to help.

03:12.322 --> 03:13.280
And if she happens
to help you out

03:13.367 --> 03:14.324
with an invite and outfit?

03:14.411 --> 03:15.586
Then it'll all be worth it.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.243
You know, I'm actually surprised

03:20.330 --> 03:21.766
Serena didn't mention it.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.551
Why? We've only been out twice.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.901
It's not like all of a sudden we
have to do everything together.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.685
Alright, well, I gotta
go deliver this stuff.

03:27.772 --> 03:29.644

to pick you up a tux.'

[instrumental music]

03:33.604 --> 03:36.303
What? It's a masked ball.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.348
I'm sure she thinks I'd never go
to something that pretentious

03:38.435 --> 03:40.394
which shows she knows me well.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.439
I know him. A masked ball?

03:42.526 --> 03:43.788
Wait-wait, Dan
would never wanna

03:43.875 --> 03:45.268
go to something
that pretentious

03:45.355 --> 03:47.139
where he has to wear
a mask and a tux?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.707
He likes you, he would
wear a tux and a mask

03:49.794 --> 03:51.448
and one of my
mother's dresses

03:51.535 --> 03:53.407
if it meant that he could
go out with you, come on.

03:53.494 --> 03:55.147
What, are you worried
that he already has a date?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.888
I mean, he is Dan Humphrey.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.413

Oh, shut up.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.197
I don't know,
I guess a masked ball

04:01.284 --> 04:02.851
is better than
a regular party

04:02.938 --> 04:04.026
because then all those kids

04:04.113 --> 04:05.288
from school that he hates

04:05.375 --> 04:06.333
he won't even recognize them.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.205
Alright. Invite him.
I insist.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.380
No, I'm not saying
I wouldn't go.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.862
I wouldn't deprive her
of my company.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.037
No, that would
be too cruel.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.213
But she hasn't asked me, so..

If you wanna go with her

04:20.608 --> 04:22.566
just make it happen.
Put yourself out there.

were family movies.

for, like, a year.

'I mean, you don't have plans.'

08:01.916 --> 08:03.874
Big night out with
over-privileged under-parented

08:03.961 --> 08:05.920
trust fund brats
from your fancy school?

08:06.007 --> 08:07.530
Ah, yeah, the limo's actually
waiting back at the loft.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.619
Good. We can egg it.
Maybe slash the tires?

08:09.706 --> 08:12.448
[Vanessa chuckles]

08:12.535 --> 08:14.755
So is it weird, having me back?

08:16.931 --> 08:19.150
No. Why, uh, why,
why would it be weird?

08:19.237 --> 08:20.804
Because..

08:20.891 --> 08:22.327
...you said some things
the night that I left--

08:22.414 --> 08:24.678
Things that you immediately
asked me to take back.

08:24.765 --> 08:28.551
Because I was leaving,
but...now I'm here.

08:28.638 --> 08:30.988
Yeah, and it's been
over a year, you know?

08:31.075 --> 08:32.686
A lot has happened, actually.

08:32.773 --> 08:35.123
And I look forward
to hearing about it, tonight.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.996
Late show? Angelika?
Whatever's playing?

08:39.083 --> 08:40.302
[both]
Unless it's "The Pacifier."

08:40.389 --> 08:42.173
[laughing]

08:42.260 --> 08:44.349
Alright. I'll get tickets.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.481
Glad to be home, Humphrey.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.049
Glad to have you, Abrams.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.659
[Chuck]
So what exactly
are you looking for?

08:50.399 --> 08:51.618
Evidence.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.315
Of what?

08:53.402 --> 08:56.405
The captain's dislike
of starchy shirts?

08:56.492 --> 08:59.016
I totally sympathize.
The collars chafe.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.671
'Did you, uh, ask him about
your missing college money?'

09:01.758 --> 09:03.543
Yeah, he said he was
moving accounts around.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.805
'It was all back the next day.'

09:04.892 --> 09:06.154
So why worry?

09:06.241 --> 09:08.199
'Mysterious
financial transactions'

09:08.286 --> 09:09.505
'warring parents.'

09:09.592 --> 09:11.551
Welcome to the Upper East Side.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.468
[intense music]

09:19.950 --> 09:20.864
[scoffs]

09:22.474 --> 09:23.519
Chi Chi get the yayo.

09:23.606 --> 09:24.955
'Nathaniel, I'm shocked.'

09:25.042 --> 09:26.696
I thought you were
strictly an herbal man.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.219
This isn't mine.

09:30.831 --> 09:32.267
[instrumental music]

09:32.354 --> 09:33.398
[Blair]
Who does this Dan Humphrey

09:33.485 --> 09:34.748
think he is?

09:34.835 --> 09:36.750
Serena is putting up
a strong front

09:36.837 --> 09:38.360
but I can see how hurt she is.

09:38.447 --> 09:39.796
We have to help her
heal her heart.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.581
But it's pretty late notice.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.147
And most of the good ones
are already taken.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.759
No more excuses. Serena must
have the hottest date ever.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.456
If he's got plans,
he'll change them.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.066
If he's got a girlfriend,
he'll dump her.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.720
And if he's out of town,
he'll charter a G5

09:50.807 --> 09:52.983
and fly home. Make it happen.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.246
- 'Do you like it?'
- 'That's outstanding.'

09:57.161 --> 09:58.336
[gasps]

10:01.209 --> 10:03.559
- Is it a bong, mother?
- Please.

10:03.646 --> 10:04.647
I didn't take you for a stoner.

10:04.734 --> 10:06.649
It's a...ukh, a hookah.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.085
- Mm-hmm.
- And it is adorable.

10:08.172 --> 10:11.045
It's perfect for my
Moroccan-themed party.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.221
Well, why do you have
to celebrate your Bendel's deal

10:13.308 --> 10:15.876
by turning our penthouse
into an opium den?

10:15.963 --> 10:18.269
Why not? Ha ha ha.

10:18.356 --> 10:19.706
[Blair on answering machine]
'Hey, it's Blair.'

10:19.793 --> 10:21.446
'I'm sorry I can't come
to the phone right now'

10:21.533 --> 10:23.361
'but I'm getting ready
for the masked ball.'

10:23.448 --> 10:24.536
'See you tonight..'

10:24.624 --> 10:25.755
'...if you recognize me'

10:25.842 --> 10:27.235
'which you won't.'

10:27.322 --> 10:28.976
Hey, Blair. It's me.

10:29.063 --> 10:30.891
I, um..

10:30.978 --> 10:32.806
Look, I just, I really
need to talk to you.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.677
It's, uh..

10:34.764 --> 10:37.114
There's this thing
with my dad and, um..

10:39.029 --> 10:41.641
...you know, I just,
I really need to talk to you.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.600
So can you call me back..

10:44.687 --> 10:46.602
...when you can? Thanks.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.302
[sighs]
Well, that's all of it.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.869
[Blair]
'Thank you so much.'

10:52.956 --> 10:54.392
I don't know what I
would've done without you.

10:54.479 --> 10:55.655
- That's okay.
- Thank you.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.526
- Yeah, it was fun.
- I'm glad.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.354
It's all part
of your education.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.096
And it looks like
you're learning.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.619
It's a nice bracelet.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.012
Vintage, right?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.143
The diamonds look real.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.276
It's 'cause they sort of are.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.497
Uh, the man at the store
lent it to me.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.761
Why would he do that?

11:14.848 --> 11:16.458
[gasps]
Oh!

11:16.545 --> 11:18.025
Oh, sweetie, you didn't think

11:18.112 --> 11:20.854
you were gonna be able
to come tonight, right?

11:20.941 --> 11:23.726
I thought maybe, yeah.

11:23.813 --> 11:26.207
Jenny, freshmen don't get
to go to the masked ball.

11:26.294 --> 11:27.774
- It's just tradition.
- No, I know.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.037
It's just that there
were five dresses.

11:30.124 --> 11:32.561
Oh, it..
You always need backup.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.955
I mean, what-what if I spilled
something or a zipper broke?

11:35.042 --> 11:37.479
Yeah, of course.
I'll, I'll remember that.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.701
- Have fun tonight.
- I will.

11:41.788 --> 11:42.919
And don't worry.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.834
Your time will come.
I promise.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.836
'Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to get ready.'

11:49.099 --> 11:50.971
Do you think
that Eleanor Waldorf

11:51.058 --> 11:52.537
will find this..

11:52.624 --> 11:54.496
...night in Tangiers enough?

11:54.583 --> 11:55.976
Maybe if you brought a goat.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.499
You know, Eleanor
always goes all-out.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.153
Speaking of going all-out..

11:59.240 --> 12:00.676
[Serena]
'Yeah, I know.
Tell me about it.'

12:00.763 --> 12:02.243
I don't think the Waldorf women

12:02.330 --> 12:05.289
ever met a theme they
didn't just love. Ha ha.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.769
You going with Dan?

12:06.856 --> 12:09.119
Um, no, Dan has plans, actually.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.251
Doing what?

12:10.338 --> 12:12.209
The question is, with whom?

12:13.602 --> 12:15.256
Oh, I didn't realize.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.648
[inhales deeply]

12:16.736 --> 12:18.563
Well, frankly, I am relieved.

12:18.650 --> 12:21.566
'You know, at your age, you
should be playing the field.'

12:21.653 --> 12:24.047
What about at your age?
You got a hot date tonight?

12:24.134 --> 12:25.919
What? No, please.

12:26.006 --> 12:26.963
Who would I be dating?

12:27.050 --> 12:28.617
[laptop beeping]

12:28.704 --> 12:30.575
'You know what,
I'm gonna go try this on'

12:30.662 --> 12:32.099
and see if I can find a goat.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.317
[laughs]

12:33.404 --> 12:34.754

12:49.203 --> 12:50.857
[Serena]
'Well, he's no Dan'

12:50.944 --> 12:52.510
'but I guess he'll do.'

12:52.597 --> 12:54.121
Hey, Jen, you're
not gonna believe this

12:54.208 --> 12:56.427
but, uh, Vanessa
is back in town.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.081
So we're going to a movie
tonight, and I don't know

12:58.168 --> 12:59.691
if you're going
to that ball or not

12:59.779 --> 13:01.215
but I was wondering
if you wanted to come with.

13:01.302 --> 13:04.348
So, uh, we're
getting tickets online.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.307
Call me back.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.626
[Gossip Girl]
Why is it that friends
of Serena van der Woodsen

13:21.713 --> 13:23.411
have to search for her suitor?

13:23.498 --> 13:25.805
Have fables fallen
so out of fashion

13:25.892 --> 13:28.546
that princesses have to do
everything themselves?

13:28.633 --> 13:30.505
Call us old-school,
but sometimes

13:30.592 --> 13:32.681
the fairy tale ending
requires the knight

13:32.768 --> 13:35.292
to get off his ass
and saddle up his steed.

13:36.946 --> 13:37.947

'Maybe it's never
too late for a bold gesture.'

14:00.840 --> 14:01.797
[knocking on door]

14:03.930 --> 14:06.454
Nate, hey.
What are you doing here?

14:06.541 --> 14:09.022
I thought you were, um..
Shouldn't you be getting ready?

14:09.109 --> 14:10.675
I'm sorry to bother you.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.155
It's, um..

14:12.242 --> 14:13.983
Do you have a minute?

14:14.070 --> 14:15.550
Yeah, of course. Come in.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.682
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.339
Maybe it's old.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.298
You know, left over
from the '90s or something

14:24.385 --> 14:26.343
from some night at Limelight
or The Tunnel?

14:26.430 --> 14:27.954
Our parents did way
worse stuff than we do.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.565
It's not old
and it makes total sense.

14:34.090 --> 14:36.440
I think he's having
some money problems.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.789
Well, have you
asked him about it?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.530
Yeah.

14:39.617 --> 14:42.055
I just wish, you know,
I wish he'd be honest with me.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.404
'It's like he
and my mom, they made'

14:43.491 --> 14:45.754
some secret pact
to act like robots.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.495
Yeah, well, I don't think
that pact is so secret.

14:47.582 --> 14:49.105
I think all of our
parents signed it.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.454
But I'm not
a little kid anymore.

14:50.541 --> 14:53.283
He...doesn't have
to shut me out.

14:57.635 --> 14:58.941
Look, if what you think is right

14:59.028 --> 15:00.769
he's probably really scared.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.771
'Maybe you'll have to tell him
how you feel more than once'

15:02.858 --> 15:04.773
'for him to really
hear you, you know?'

15:06.383 --> 15:08.255
Hey, don't give up, okay?

15:13.564 --> 15:14.826
You should probably go.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.741
You know, I've got-gotta
get ready and stuff.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.830
Yeah, me too. Um..

15:18.918 --> 15:20.615
Look, thanks for just,
you know, listening--

15:20.702 --> 15:22.443
It's fine. Yeah,
don't worry about it.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.793
Chuck just wanted a bump and
Blair's phone was turned off

15:24.880 --> 15:27.230
so it, um...really means a lot.

15:27.317 --> 15:28.840
Yeah, anytime, Nate.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.800
I'll see you tonight, okay?

15:31.887 --> 15:34.063
Alright. I'll see ya. Bye.

15:39.025 --> 15:40.940
Hey, anybody home?

15:42.115 --> 15:43.464
Hey, you and Dan going out?

15:43.551 --> 15:45.248
Just to the movies.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.597
What about you?

15:46.684 --> 15:48.730
A Humphrey man
in a sports coat?

15:48.817 --> 15:50.340
I'd normally ask
if you had a date, but--

15:50.427 --> 15:51.994
But my wife left me, hmm?

15:52.081 --> 15:54.170
Yeah. What's up with Alison?

15:54.257 --> 15:55.563
Dan says she's still upstate.

15:55.650 --> 15:56.956
I thought that was
just for the summer.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.045
So did her husband.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.917
Okay...we'll
circle back to that.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.528
- One issue at a time.
- Like where are my keys?

16:04.615 --> 16:06.704
What do you need keys for?
Just use Dan's window.

16:06.791 --> 16:07.879
Where is Dan, by the way?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.707
Uh, he should
be back in a minute.

16:09.794 --> 16:12.058
Hmm.

16:12.145 --> 16:14.364
So, uh, Dan seems
happy to see you.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.757
Why wouldn't he be?

16:15.844 --> 16:19.195
Well, um, if you don't
mind me saying so..

16:19.282 --> 16:21.545
...when you left here,
you kinda broke his heart.

16:22.894 --> 16:25.245
I'm back, aren't I?

16:25.332 --> 16:28.552
I hated being away
from the city..

16:28.639 --> 16:30.554
...away from Dan.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.556
Did you tell Dan this?

16:32.643 --> 16:36.082
No, not yet, but I'm
planning on it tonight..

16:36.169 --> 16:38.780
...before or after the movie.
I'm...not sure yet.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.000
You know,
I gotta pick my moment.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.002
It's kind of a big deal.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.048
'Hmm.'

16:46.135 --> 16:47.745
Oh, thanks.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.619
You know, there's, uh..

16:51.706 --> 16:53.534
...a lot that's changed
since you were here.

16:53.621 --> 16:54.970
So Dan says.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.493
'But you guys have
always been close.'

16:56.580 --> 16:58.713
You'll figure it out.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.281
- Wish me luck?
- Me too.

17:01.368 --> 17:03.587
- Where are you going, anyway?
- Uh, just some party.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.502
With a friend?

17:05.589 --> 17:08.027
I wouldn't exactly
call her that.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.202
[cell phone ringing]

17:09.289 --> 17:10.464
See ya.

17:12.248 --> 17:13.858
[cell phone ringing]

17:15.382 --> 17:17.558
- Hello?
- Hey. Where are you?

17:17.645 --> 17:19.908
- At your house.
