02:29.191 --> 02:31.109
This is the president.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.570
- <i>Put on Conway.</i>
- You will speak to me.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.156
<i>No, we only talk to him
or we hang up.</i>

02:36.239 --> 02:39.993
Do you hear the helicopters yet?
Or the dogs?

02:40.077 --> 02:42.663
We're getting closer and we will find you.

02:42.746 --> 02:46.291
The only question is will you
work with us before we get there?

02:46.374 --> 02:49.377
The money's not happening
and neither is the military withdrawal.

02:49.461 --> 02:51.213
But you're smart enough to know that.

02:51.296 --> 02:55.175
The objective here is Ahmadi,
and that's what I'd like to discuss.

02:55.258 --> 02:58.220
<i>Well, the choice is yours.
You either meet our demands or you don't.</i>

03:01.849 --> 03:05.268
I spoke at length last night
with Governor Conway.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.021
I was of a mind
to ignore your call this morning,

03:08.105 --> 03:10.648
but he convinced me
that we should keep talking.

03:10.733 --> 03:12.650
Isn't that right, Governor?

03:13.736 --> 03:16.739
- I just want a peaceful resolution.
- As do I.

03:16.822 --> 03:20.158
You wanted to include the Governor,
I want to include Ahmadi.

03:20.242 --> 03:23.370
<i>- You're trying to stall.</i>
- You refusing to speak to your leader?

03:23.453 --> 03:24.704
<i>Is he on now?</i>

03:24.788 --> 03:27.332
You release the Millers,
then we put him on.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.793
<i>No, you don't get to dictate terms.</i>

03:29.877 --> 03:32.587
We show good will
when you show good will.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.549
I'm giving you ten seconds
to reconsider your position.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.719
After that, we disconnect the call.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.846
Insha'Allah.
<i>We'll kill them.</i>

03:42.347 --> 03:43.974
Ten seconds, starting now.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.230
Five seconds.

03:54.692 --> 03:57.612
- End the call.
<i>- One hostage.</i>

03:57.695 --> 03:59.572
- All three.
<i>- One.</i>

03:59.656 --> 04:01.742
Give us the daughter
and the mother.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.786
<i>No, we keep the girl.</i>

04:03.869 --> 04:06.579
You managed to get the President
of the United States on the phone

04:06.663 --> 04:08.290
not once, but twice.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.500
You will release
the daughter and the mother

04:10.583 --> 04:12.210
or you will never hear from me again,

04:12.294 --> 04:14.838
and you will lose your chance
to speak to your leader.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.339
Tell me now.

04:20.803 --> 04:22.220
They've disconnected, sir.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.444
Stop.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.244
Mr. Ahmadi.

04:48.246 --> 04:52.042
You can shower upstairs.
There's fresh clothes in the closet.

05:33.375 --> 05:34.626
The only people who know
are the Chairman

05:34.709 --> 05:35.752
and the SEALs who escorted him.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.505
- Do we have a secure line?
- Direct to the Oval.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.049
Mr. President...

05:43.176 --> 05:46.138
I would have never condoned
bringing Ahmadi into this.

05:46.221 --> 05:48.140
Well, lucky for me,
I'm not making decisions

05:48.223 --> 05:50.225
based on what you would
or would not condone.

05:50.308 --> 05:54.187
Watch me tell the press
you put words in my mouth.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.647
Feel free.

05:55.730 --> 05:58.233
I think they'll have a hard time
believing you, though.

05:58.858 --> 06:02.779
Check your messages.
I'm sure your staff's been emailing you.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.824
Arrange for a car to get the governor
and his family to the airport.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.368
Have a safe trip back to New York.

06:39.857 --> 06:41.151
I've had lunch brought in.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.404
I'm sure it's been quite a while
since you've had a hot meal.

06:44.988 --> 06:48.741
- I won't be eating it.
- Aren't you hungry?

06:48.825 --> 06:51.453
I don't wanna get sick
while I'm being tortured.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.498
No one's getting tortured.
Please, have a seat.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.598
You want me to tell these men
to release the family, right?

07:11.681 --> 07:13.725
If I don't, you'll do what you have to do.

07:13.808 --> 07:17.938
Oh, if we had any intention of that,
you never would have left Guantanamo.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.689
Nor would I be here.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.566
Where is here?

07:23.151 --> 07:25.195
Virginia, in a government safe house.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.823
And why you?

07:28.906 --> 07:32.619
Out of respect...
for the gravity of this situation.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.331
I think your intention
is to humiliate me.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.959
You've been properly clothed,
offered food.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.128
How are we humiliating you?

07:42.170 --> 07:44.547
I'm sitting across from a woman.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.678
There's no reason
to keep up the facade.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.057
You and your brother
are not fundamentalists,

07:54.141 --> 07:55.517
nor are you Syrian.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.478
This what the CIA's feeding you?

07:59.021 --> 08:02.357
You're Iraqi.
Your real name is Al Awad.

08:07.112 --> 08:11.366
Actually, it says that you joined
the Baath Party in 2000.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.743
You were the assistant
to the undersecretary of infrastructure,

08:13.826 --> 08:15.828
2001, 2002.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.580
Say whatever you want.

08:18.331 --> 08:22.585
My brother will deny.
You won't convince anyone but yourselves.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.091
We expel the Baathists

08:28.175 --> 08:31.553
and you go from a bureaucrat
to an extremist.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.681
But you're a well-educated man, Yusuf...

08:35.557 --> 08:38.143
and you don't care about Islam
or the caliphate.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.645
You're just using that
to radicalize soldiers.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.024
Just as you use democracy and freedom.

08:45.817 --> 08:47.944
So now we understand each other.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.743
Yusuf Al Ahmadi remains
in solitary confinement in Guantanamo.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.870
If Caroline and Melissa Miller
are released,

08:57.954 --> 09:01.041
we will allow supervised contact
with the kidnappers.

09:01.124 --> 09:02.417
Mark.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.628
Ahmadi has consistently encouraged
acts of terror like this one.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.964
What makes you think
that any sort of dialogue

09:08.048 --> 09:09.591
will lead to a peaceful resolution?

09:09.674 --> 09:11.843
Well, the alternative
is no dialogue at all.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.386
We don't wanna leave
any stone unturned.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.222
Sara.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.432
Will you comment on
the <i>Wall Street Telegraph</i> article

09:17.515 --> 09:19.235
about Governor Conway's
alleged interference

09:19.309 --> 09:20.727
with the House Intelligence Committee?

09:20.810 --> 09:24.189
Well, it confirms
what we suspected to be true,

09:24.272 --> 09:26.983
but I think you want
the governor's comment, not ours.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.402
Congressman Walleck
is misrepresenting events.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.946
- You're saying he lied?
- I'm saying he misrepresented.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.407
I have a number of friends
on the Intelligence Committee,

09:34.491 --> 09:37.077
and do I speak with them sometimes?
Of course.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.786
But that's not the same as interfering.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.081
So you never discussed the Russia plan
with anyone on the committee?

09:41.164 --> 09:42.207
We may have discussed it,

09:42.290 --> 09:44.542
but it's not as though
I was issuing orders.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.379
And I have to say,
everyone's primary focus right now

09:47.462 --> 09:49.339
needs to be on the Miller family,
not this.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.091
Did the president ask you
to leave the White House?

09:51.174 --> 09:54.677
Uh, we agreed that I'd done my part,
and that the rest is up to him.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.053
Can you tell us about
your conversation last night

09:56.138 --> 09:57.597
with the president,
regarding Ahmadi?

09:57.680 --> 09:59.015
That'll be all for now.
Thank you so much.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.017
Question, sir.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.188
Let's go.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.732
Uh, hold on,
I'm still fastening Lily's car seat.

10:09.942 --> 10:11.653
- Will...
- Not a word.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.531
Well, I have to tell you,
the general's apeshit

10:14.614 --> 10:17.867
over what you said about
being ashamed of your service.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.327
He may talk to the press.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.789
Nobody does any press until we have
a proper response to all this shit.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.582
Daddy said "shit."
Shit, shit, shit!

10:24.666 --> 10:26.876
Stop it!

10:26.959 --> 10:29.796
You need to bring me something on Walleck.
We need to discredit him.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.799
- Are you done yet?
- You don't need to snap at us.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.508
- Are you done yet?
- Yes.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.009
Let's go. Now.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.138
That's if they're released.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.223
We'll fill in the blanks
once we have details.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.810
This is if the worst happens.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.900
Yates wrote these?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.362
No, I... I took a stab at it first.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.243
Also, Tom Hammerschmidt called.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.455
He wants an interview with the president.
He wouldn't say what for.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.833
What outlet is he with now?

11:06.916 --> 11:10.337
He's back at the <i>Herald.</i>
Said he emailed you directly.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.105
I need the room.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.275
Everyone out.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.532
Get me the <i>Herald.</i>

11:40.992 --> 11:42.285
Tom Hammerschmidt.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.413
Well, there's a cell tower here.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.915
Uh, typically very low traffic,

11:47.999 --> 11:50.877
but it showed higher usage
during the time of the call,

11:50.960 --> 11:52.712
especially the southeastern antenna.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.298
So we should be able to ping the hotspot,
zero in?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.799
Eh, it's hundreds of tower faces.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.302
I can give you the general area,
but pinpointing will take longer.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.845
I can't even guarantee it's gonna be them.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.722
I want every one of those towers analyzed.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.683
Well, we're better off concentrating
on ambient background sound.

12:05.767 --> 12:10.229
If I can match that to other calls made
in this area around the same time as...

12:10.313 --> 12:13.691
I'm not asking your advice.
I'm telling you what I want you to do.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.527
Focus on the tower data.

12:17.654 --> 12:21.240
We were concentrating on this area,
but it looks like they're closer to here.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.285
We've got ground teams
setting up a search grid.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.494
Can we use satellites?

12:24.577 --> 12:27.997
We are, but there are over 100
possible structures within the zone.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.000
- Each one of them needs to be checked.
- How long?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.753
If we get lucky, within hours.
If not, could be tomorrow.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.004
Sir, Mr. Stamper's here.

12:35.087 --> 12:36.506
- He says it's urgent.
- Thank you.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.216
Hammerschmidt says
they go online today,

12:39.301 --> 12:41.010
whether you comment or not.

12:46.433 --> 12:51.062
Travel logs are not hard evidence.
These quotes are circumstantial.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.815
But all of it combined...
I don't know how we spin this.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.401
He's got heavy hitters on the record.

12:56.484 --> 12:59.195
Should I release the photos
of Jackie and Remy?

12:59.278 --> 13:01.280
They told him about the affair.

13:01.364 --> 13:03.950
He's putting in the article
that we threatened to expose them.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.702
How did this happen?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.623
This is as much on you.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.673
I can put together a list
of the people he hasn't gotten to yet.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.592
And give him proof of a cover-up?

13:20.675 --> 13:23.177
He's right.
If we reach out to Tusk or Lanagin...

13:23.260 --> 13:24.637
I want Hammerschmidt here.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.892
- Sir, I wasn't suggesting...
- Set it up as soon as possible.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.689
The U.S. government
will never recognize the caliphate.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.859
No, of course not.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.904
But we can reintegrate the Baathists
into the government.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.157
What government?
There's no government in Iraq.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.827
There is no Iraq.
There's Baghdad.

13:47.910 --> 13:50.830
Shia, Sunni, Kurd...

13:50.913 --> 13:52.374
Syria is the same.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.836
You maintained order
before we shut you out.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.965
Now, we can't support a theocracy,

14:01.048 --> 14:03.718
but we can put the military
back in control.

14:05.011 --> 14:08.222
What do we do
with all the soldiers we've recruited?

14:08.305 --> 14:10.933
They won't accept a secular government.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.185
You'll keep them in check.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.605
With force, if necessary.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.107
Use our guns on the men
who carried it for us.

14:19.025 --> 14:22.779
What does it matter...
if you have back your power?

14:22.862 --> 14:26.783
If this is your intention,
why have you said nothing publicly?

14:27.992 --> 14:32.246
Because you know that all of this
has to be done behind closed doors.

14:32.329 --> 14:36.125
We need to give the appearance
that we neutralized ICO.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.424
What happens
if they don't release the hostages?

14:42.507 --> 14:44.676
Well, then you go back to Cuba.

14:44.759 --> 14:48.345
If they do,
then we put you on the phone with them...

14:48.430 --> 14:50.640
and you tell them to release the third.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.935
And then you send me back to Cuba anyway.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.897
I do understand why you don't trust us,
but what is the alternative?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.857
These people die,
and then it gives us

14:59.941 --> 15:03.445
all the justification we need
for a full offensive.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.071
That's years...

15:06.197 --> 15:08.408
and you won't completely destroy us.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.703
Not completely,
but enough to make you irrelevant.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.873
Or we can quietly work together.

15:15.957 --> 15:19.794
ICO fades,
and you and your generals get control.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.811
Hey. Uh...

15:48.781 --> 15:51.242
- Do you know where Claire is?
- No, we're trying to find her.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.495
She usually keeps me informed
if she's going somewhere.

15:53.578 --> 15:54.787
Have you asked Secret Service?

15:54.871 --> 15:56.664
- They didn't know.
- They have to know.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.207
I'll go ask again.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.543
Thanks.

16:01.919 --> 16:03.921
She wasn't at the residence.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.923
- You went up there?
- Ten minutes ago.

16:06.883 --> 16:08.593
What's going on between you two?

16:12.555 --> 16:14.516
You think I haven't noticed?

16:14.599 --> 16:17.184
How you two talk?
How often you're here?

16:17.268 --> 16:20.605
I don't even have unrestricted
access to the residence.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.608
I was with her when her mother died.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.569
It made us close.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.863
Don't read too much into it.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.447
Well, however close you are,

16:30.532 --> 16:33.325
just make sure that nobody else
can read too much into it.

16:35.119 --> 16:38.790
Well, if you see Claire,
tell her I went home.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.249
If she needs me.

16:43.795 --> 16:47.048
Don't meet face-to-face.
Have him submit the questions in writing.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.676
Yeah, but if I meet with him,
maybe I can give him pause.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.279
<i>No, he's trying to trap you
into giving something away.</i>

16:52.344 --> 16:54.221
That's not going to happen.

16:54.305 --> 16:57.892
- <i>The timing on this...</i>
- How's your end?

16:59.268 --> 17:00.603
<i>He's getting there.</i>

17:00.687 --> 17:04.231
Well, you focus on him.
I'll handle Hammerschmidt.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.944
<i>Are you smoking?</i>

17:09.028 --> 17:11.864
- How did you know?
<i>- I can hear it.</i>

17:12.949 --> 17:16.828
If this story comes out,
it won't be the smoking that does us in.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.461
Have they been killed?

17:27.421 --> 17:28.756
You look upset.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.051
Do you miss your wife?

17:33.260 --> 17:34.804
You don't care about my wife.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.724
Ah, I don't care
about either of you...

17:38.891 --> 17:42.436
whether you live or die...
or your children do.

17:42.519 --> 17:45.815
But if speaking to your family
once a month will get us there,

17:45.898 --> 17:47.149
I'll put that on the table.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.196
I haven't seen my wife in three years.

17:52.279 --> 17:56.200
I have a son I've never met,
a daughter that doesn't remember me.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.910
This is our path.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.122
Even if they're killed?

18:02.582 --> 18:03.666
Yes.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.210
Because they will be.

18:07.419 --> 18:10.381
I'm willing to die, and so are they.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.467
- Would they have made that choice?
- What choice?

18:13.550 --> 18:17.263
All they've known are your bombs.
Poof, gone.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.350
We're effective
because we make you feel the pain.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.982
We've felt it all our lives.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.653
Yes?

18:34.571 --> 18:37.867
- Tom.
- Mr. President.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.412
I'm gonna ask that everything
we discuss today is off the record.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.289
- Understood.
- Now, the last time we met,

18:43.372 --> 18:44.916
it was in the vice president's office,

18:44.999 --> 18:49.461
and you claim that I acquired
that office by manipulating Matthews.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.380
I don't claim that.
President Walker does.

18:51.463 --> 18:54.676
Oh, yes. A man made bitter
by his own mistakes.

18:54.759 --> 18:58.512
And you also claim
that I then acquired this office

18:58.595 --> 19:01.182
by pushing out that very same man.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.601
- Danton and Sharp corroborated.
- Oh, yes.

19:04.686 --> 19:07.021
Two people with very big chips
on their shoulders,

19:07.104 --> 19:11.651
fabricating all this nonsense
to justify their infidelity.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.111
You're saying you didn't blackmail them?

19:14.195 --> 19:16.488
I pressure a lot of people, Tom.
That's part of politics.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.365
But never those two.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.869
Danton's parents say LeAnn Harvey
came to their house in Miami.

19:21.953 --> 19:25.122
Well, I imagine that's because
he wanted LeAnn on the Russian plan.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.958
Then why did she come to him
instead of him coming to her?

19:27.041 --> 19:28.625
Look, I'm not gonna get
into the weeds on this,

19:28.710 --> 19:30.169
but let's just cut to the chase.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.879
The allegations that you're making

19:31.963 --> 19:34.716
are just as ludicrous as they were
the first time we met.

19:34.799 --> 19:36.843
I had nothing concrete then.
This time I do.

19:36.926 --> 19:40.262
Three people with an ax to grind,
no hard evidence and some travel logs?

19:40.346 --> 19:41.889
I'd hardly call that concrete.

19:41.973 --> 19:45.685
- It's enough for a story.
- You're floating an idea out of thin air.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.938
Let's just call this what it is:
blatant sensationalism

19:49.021 --> 19:50.690
- tied to the election...
- I don't float.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.776
Tied to an election
to boost your circulation

19:53.860 --> 19:55.486
because the <i>Herald</i> is losing readership.

19:55.569 --> 19:59.907
Sir, I don't float stories
to see if they're seaworthy,

19:59.991 --> 20:02.910
and I don't give a shit about circulation.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.872
The only thing I care about
is the truth.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.206
The truth?

20:07.289 --> 20:11.293
So have you reached out to Raymond Tusk
for a comment? Or Daniel Lanagin?

20:11.377 --> 20:13.545
I don't see their quotes in here.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.797
I mean, if you're going for the truth,

20:14.881 --> 20:17.258
doesn't that include being thorough?
Being balanced?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.218
Which is why I'm giving you
an opportunity to comment.

20:19.301 --> 20:22.346
And what about any members of Congress?
I don't see their quotes in here.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.640
I'm sure they'll answer my calls
once this article comes out.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.100
Oh, I think you're afraid
to make those calls,

20:26.183 --> 20:28.728
'cause you know
they'll see this for what it is...

20:28.811 --> 20:31.981
unsupported tabloid gossip.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.401
The assistant whip,
your former Chief of Staff,

20:35.484 --> 20:36.986
an ex-president of the United States.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.238
That's not gossip.
It's news.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.881
There's no way the Justice Department
doesn't open up an inquiry.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.619
And if they don't,
the Republicans in Congress will.

20:45.702 --> 20:49.206
Downplay this all you want,
but you know where this story leads.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.708
I know what this story is.

20:51.793 --> 20:55.046
Political sabotage, plain and simple.

20:55.129 --> 21:00.259
Margaret Tilden used to have
some integrity, Tom.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.136
And so did you.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.389
Why are you wasting
America's time with this,

21:05.472 --> 21:06.808
in the middle of this crisis?

21:07.391 --> 21:09.393
Where is your conscience?

21:10.812 --> 21:13.439
That's the question
I want you to answer.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.528
Yes?

21:20.947 --> 21:23.991
Sir, they emailed a location
of the mother and daughter.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.577
Will you please show Mr. Hammerschmidt
into the Roosevelt Room?

21:26.660 --> 21:27.787
There's no need.
I'll be going.

21:27.870 --> 21:30.790
Oh, no, no, no.
You and I are not done, Tom.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.735
Caroline and Melissa Miller were rescued

21:59.819 --> 22:04.365
at approximately 12:30
Eastern Standard Time by FBI field agents.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.827
Aside from the psychological trauma
of their ordeal,

22:07.910 --> 22:10.913
both are unharmed and healthy.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.332
I'll be calling them soon,
and I hope to meet them soon,

22:13.415 --> 22:15.960
once they have had
their full medical examinations.

22:16.043 --> 22:19.964
<i>And while I am greatly relieved
to have them both safe,</i>

22:20.047 --> 22:21.841
<i>James Miller remains in danger.</i>

22:21.924 --> 22:25.427
<i>And we will not rest
until I can come to this podium</i>

22:25.511 --> 22:28.097
<i>and make another
announcement like this one,</i>

22:28.180 --> 22:30.557
<i>informing you of his safe return.</i>

22:30.641 --> 22:33.269
Mr. Grayson will answer
any questions you may have.

22:33.352 --> 22:36.730
I must get back to work.
Thank you all very much.

22:36.813 --> 22:40.776
They're alive.
You can take some credit for that.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.779
I'm sure Underwood's flying them
to the White House right now.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.364
<i>Caroline and Melissa
will remain under...</i>

22:45.447 --> 22:47.866
That's the image everyone will remember.

22:47.950 --> 22:50.995
The warm embrace, the reassuring words.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.247
I mean, he's not gonna let me take
one ounce of credit for this.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.041
<i>If they choose to talk
with the media, however,</i>

22:55.124 --> 22:56.625
<i>we will certainly facilitate that.</i>

22:57.459 --> 23:01.255
<i>- I will now take some of your questions.</i>
- What if it were Lily and me?

23:01.338 --> 23:04.050
Will, what if it were me and Lily?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.968
Would this be your thinking?

23:06.052 --> 23:08.595
- "The political fallout"?
- Don't, Hannah.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.765
Don't get weak on me.

23:11.848 --> 23:15.144
<i>I can confirm that that is an area
where our focus is,</i>

23:15.227 --> 23:17.396
<i>but that's about as much
detail as I can go into.</i>

23:18.647 --> 23:20.274
<i>Have the kidnappers made contact?</i>

23:20.357 --> 23:22.109
<i>And if so, did you put them
in touch with Ahmadi?</i>

23:22.193 --> 23:25.321
They have not made contact.
We encourage them to do so.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.948
And, yes, the offer still stands.

23:27.031 --> 23:28.115
Mary.

23:28.199 --> 23:31.285
Uh, what assurances do you have
that Ahmadi will say what you want him to?

23:31.368 --> 23:33.120
We don't,
and we can't force him to.

23:33.204 --> 23:35.914
But we're hoping
that he will work with us on this.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.375
Who's managing the call
from his side in Cuba?

23:38.459 --> 23:39.876
I'm sorry,
I can't go into details on that.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.795
Both were blindfolded in the car,

23:41.878 --> 23:44.298
but the mother estimates
a drive time of 45 minutes.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.021
That narrows the search
to six structures.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.172
Unless they're on the move.

23:47.218 --> 23:48.552
If they're past the roadblocks already,

23:48.635 --> 23:49.886
they've gotta stop somewhere
to make the call.

23:49.971 --> 23:52.451
And we've had some progress
on tracing the call.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.895
Hey, hey.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.481
You're taking my algorithms.

24:00.564 --> 24:03.109
We need more teams on this.
There is not enough room here.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.694
You know my instructions were
never to let anything leave this building.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.071
We have an order from the director.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.156
Well, if you put more teams on this,
it'll cause confusion.

24:09.240 --> 24:12.784
Go home, Mr. Macallan.
You've been here for two days straight.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.286
I am not leaving this

24:14.370 --> 24:16.872
in the hands of people
who do not know what they're doing.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.165
We've got it covered.

24:18.249 --> 24:22.253
Go home. Get some rest.
We'll let you know if we need you.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.425
These boys don't wanna kill anyone.

24:29.343 --> 24:31.762
If they did, they wouldn't have
released two hostages.

24:31.845 --> 24:34.181
They're actually looking
for an excuse to back out.

24:34.265 --> 24:37.518
If the media plays that video,
I look like a traitor.

24:37.601 --> 24:41.272
We tell them it's a precondition.
If they share it, the deal is off.

24:42.523 --> 24:43.774
How do I know you won't?

24:44.441 --> 24:47.111
I can't force you to believe me...

24:47.194 --> 24:49.988
but we are hours from finding them.

24:50.072 --> 24:51.490
And you know how this goes.

24:51.573 --> 24:55.286
Jim Miller dies.
They die.

24:55.369 --> 24:58.205
You go back to Cuba.
We go to war.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.457
We're already at war.

25:00.541 --> 25:06.338
Yusuf, you have one chance
to change the conditions at home.

25:07.256 --> 25:11.093
You squander it, you destroy everything
you have ever fought for.

25:13.637 --> 25:16.182
What do you know about
fighting for anything?

25:17.766 --> 25:19.601
We're done here.
Send him back.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.440
All right.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.444
I'll do what you ask.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.780
Put him back in his jumpsuit.
We'll film in the basement.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.240
Yes, ma'am.

25:34.616 --> 25:37.078
Tell the senator
I'll call him when I get back.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.788
- Mr. President.
- Oh, Cathy.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.665
I realize we haven't had a chance
to discuss everything.

25:41.748 --> 25:42.999
We'll talk foreign policy consequences

25:43.084 --> 25:44.293
once we've resolved
this hostage situation.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.795
It's not that.
The <i>Herald</i> contacted me.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.716
A reporter called my office.
I've read the email.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.399
- You didn't call them back?
- 'Course not.

25:52.426 --> 25:54.386
All right. Don't do or say anything.
I'll handle it.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.180
- How?
- I don't know yet.

25:56.263 --> 25:58.724
Walker says we conspired
for Secretary of State,

25:58.807 --> 26:01.768
and saying I gave him asylum
during the investigation.

26:01.852 --> 26:03.854
If they publish this,
I get skinned alive, too.

26:03.937 --> 26:07.941
We're going to be all right, Cathy.
Trust me on this.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.791
I just spoke with Secretary Durant.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.461
We have a timeline.

26:28.504 --> 26:31.798
My folks don't hear from me,
they start making calls on the hour.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.842
Durant was first.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.802
Birch is next.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.721
Then Womack.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.223
Michael Kern.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.726
It was Zoe's article
that ruined his chances.

26:42.809 --> 26:44.686
You knew her.
You were in her neighborhood.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.480
This is irresponsible, Tom.

26:46.563 --> 26:49.608
When the whole nation is in the middle
of this major terror threat.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.318
That's the same reasoning dictators use.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.697
You remind me
a little bit of Kate Baldwin.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.283
You've lost your objectivity.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.701
Uh, it's funny you mention her.

26:59.785 --> 27:03.121
Kate thought Lucas was onto something.
I told her to let it go,

27:03.205 --> 27:05.541
that there wasn't anything there,
but there was.

27:05.624 --> 27:10.045
Well, where are the facts?
Facts, not quotes. Facts.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.713
You wanna see a fact?

27:13.006 --> 27:14.508
This is a fact.

27:15.133 --> 27:20.138
I told you he was crazy,
and there's the proof.

27:20.222 --> 27:23.309
He had the facts wrong,
but he had the story right.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.479
He saw through you.

27:27.563 --> 27:30.399
So what is the story? That I'm some sort
of psychopath? That I'm a killer?

27:30.482 --> 27:32.401
Oh, I never believed you were a murderer,
and I still don't.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.237
But it's becoming harder
not to entertain the thought.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.948
Well, should I get you a gun,
so you can shoot me, too?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.911
He was right about your soul.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.706
What's in your bones.

27:45.789 --> 27:49.335
That you're ruthless.
You're corrupt.

27:49.418 --> 27:52.254
You destroy whatever's in your path.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.881
Hmm.

27:54.965 --> 27:58.594
Name me a president you wouldn't
describe in exactly the same way.

27:58.677 --> 28:02.180
We're all ruthless.
We all destroy.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.808
But corruption?
That's a matter of perspective.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.018
No.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.604
It's a matter of law.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.606
All right, you seem
a little confused here, Tom.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.985
One moment you're talking about my soul,
and the next moment you want to get legal.

28:16.111 --> 28:19.240
Let's at least achieve
some clarity here today, shall we?

28:20.366 --> 28:22.784
You want the real story?

28:24.661 --> 28:26.622
Zoe Barnes?

28:26.705 --> 28:29.708
Yes, we knew each other.
Professionally.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.378
I scratched her back
and she scratched mine.

28:32.461 --> 28:35.506
And you printed all of it.

28:38.634 --> 28:40.677
You were her source
for the education bill.

28:40.761 --> 28:43.805
- And Michael Kern.
- You sabotaged him.

28:43.889 --> 28:47.726
Okay, ask yourself
why I would have done all those things.

28:50.145 --> 28:54.691
Because the education bill was a disaster,
and I had to move the president off of it.

28:54.775 --> 28:58.069
Because Michael Kern was
a terrible choice for Secretary of State.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.531
We could do better,
and we did, with Cathy.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.283
I was trying to help Walker.

29:02.366 --> 29:06.578
I was trying to steer a weak president
in the right direction.

29:06.662 --> 29:08.622
Now, you want to print that story,
you go right ahead.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.206
But the rest of it is just nonsense.

29:10.291 --> 29:11.875
You didn't make any deals
with Raymond Tusk?

29:11.958 --> 29:14.461
- Absolutely not.
- Then why did you pardon him?

29:14.545 --> 29:17.145
Same reason I pardoned Walker.
Because the country had to move on.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.800
You didn't orchestrate his impeachment?

29:19.883 --> 29:22.511
Why would I want to impeach a president
I was working so hard to help?

29:22.594 --> 29:24.721
You're still here.
He's not.

29:25.639 --> 29:27.766
I was trying to save him
from himself.

29:29.935 --> 29:31.937
Unfortunately, I failed.

29:35.399 --> 29:38.694
- Do you trust your instincts, Tom?
- I always have.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.737
Then look me in the eye.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.953
I've told you the truth.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.124
What you said...

29:54.042 --> 29:55.794
is it on the record now?

29:57.212 --> 29:58.797
Do you believe me?

29:59.715 --> 30:01.425
Not for a second.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.472
Then, no.
Not a word.

30:15.481 --> 30:19.275
We'll give you a few hours
if you want to make an official comment.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.499
I'm ready to go now.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.045
If they release the father, you're a hero.

30:39.129 --> 30:42.341
<i>It's not enough.
I don't know how we survive this story.</i>

30:46.428 --> 30:50.391
My mind keeps racing,
over and over and over again.

30:50.474 --> 30:53.560
<i>What we could've done differently.
How we could've covered our tracks.</i>

30:53.644 --> 30:55.896
<i>The people we should've kept closer...</i>

30:57.564 --> 30:59.149
I'm frightened, Claire.

30:59.232 --> 31:02.444
<i>If we can't stop the damage,
we have to control it, Francis.</i>

31:03.654 --> 31:05.572
There is a solution.
There always is.

31:05.656 --> 31:07.908
Hold on.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.451
They're on, sir.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.161
We just got word.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.163
- They've called in.
<i>- Yes, I was just told.</i>

31:13.246 --> 31:15.457
<i>All right, this first.
One thing at a time.</i>

31:29.220 --> 31:31.181
- The link is up?
- Yes, ma'am.

31:31.264 --> 31:32.641
We've located the building.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.444
Matches the description
from Caroline Miller

31:34.476 --> 31:35.977
and the drive time
from where they were found.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.729
Are we certain that they're there?

31:37.813 --> 31:40.816
No, sir, but we have a team en route.

31:40.899 --> 31:44.945
Let's see how the phone call goes,
and then we'll decide if we're gonna move.

31:45.028 --> 31:47.280
The line is open.

31:47.363 --> 31:48.615
Go ahead.

31:49.240 --> 31:52.453
- This is the president.
<i>- Where's Ahmadi?</i>

31:52.536 --> 31:56.081
We're about to connect him via video,
so you know that he's speaking freely.

31:56.164 --> 32:00.877
But before we do, be aware that if
you release any of this call to the media,

32:00.961 --> 32:04.130
anything we discuss will be off the table.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.799
<i>Put him on.</i>

32:12.556 --> 32:14.683
Assalam-alaikum.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.351
Walaikum-assalam.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.853
<i>I know you are trying to free me.</i>

32:24.443 --> 32:25.486
English.

32:27.488 --> 32:30.365
Listen to me.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.118
You've already done your duty.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.203
You have made the world pay attention.

32:35.286 --> 32:38.540
But the U.S. government,
they will not free me.

32:38.624 --> 32:43.044
And if you harm this man,
they'll bring more bloodshed on Muslims.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.838
Let him go.

32:44.921 --> 32:48.759
They have promised me they will
only charge you for kidnapping...

32:48.842 --> 32:50.301
not as terrorists.

32:53.722 --> 32:56.432
<i>Are they forcing you to say this?</i>

32:56.517 --> 32:57.934
No.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.816
<i>Who are you looking to?</i>

33:14.826 --> 33:16.620
Off.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.755
They've hung up.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.010
What did he just say?

33:32.093 --> 33:33.261
What did you say?

33:35.221 --> 33:36.598
Tell me what you said.

33:39.267 --> 33:40.852
I'm not a traitor.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.273
Keep him down here.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.654
<i>"Release the video.</i>

33:50.737 --> 33:52.948
<i>If they don't send me home, kill them.</i>

33:53.031 --> 33:55.325
<i>If they find you, kill him.</i>

33:55.408 --> 33:59.370
<i>Make sure you have proof that I..."
And then it goes black.</i>

33:59.454 --> 34:01.540
<i>Where that leaves us,
we don't know right now.</i>

34:01.623 --> 34:04.793
<i>The White House has not briefed the press
or issued any statement...</i>

34:10.422 --> 34:12.092
What do I say to this?

34:12.175 --> 34:13.895
- We say nothing.
- No, I can't say nothing,

34:13.927 --> 34:16.262
'cause I got 100 reporters
that are about to break down that door.

34:16.346 --> 34:19.725
We are not going to expose ourselves
until we have something concrete to go on.

34:19.808 --> 34:22.268
Like the guy's head rolling?
Or are you saying nothing then, too?

34:22.351 --> 34:23.436
Or how about the <i>Herald</i> article?

34:23.518 --> 34:25.021
When that comes out,
are you gonna say nothing?

34:25.105 --> 34:26.106
Seth...

34:26.188 --> 34:29.442
Look, I will lock myself up in here.
I'll bury my head in the sand.

34:29.525 --> 34:33.071
But eventually,
it's me that has to face these people.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.697
All right, I can't hide the way that you...

34:34.781 --> 34:36.157
Stop. Stop!

34:38.451 --> 34:40.078
Keep your shit together.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.246
Okay?

34:43.665 --> 34:47.002
Eat some food.
Rest your eyes for a little bit.

34:48.670 --> 34:50.380
I'll let you know when I know more.

35:07.898 --> 35:10.316
- Oh, sir, a...
- Not now.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.663
- You brought him here?
- I brought myself.

35:22.746 --> 35:24.831
It's serious, Doug.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.595
Ready.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.636
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

36:20.721 --> 36:22.263
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

36:25.100 --> 36:26.601
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

36:31.356 --> 36:32.476
<i>- Clear.
- Clear.</i>

36:33.024 --> 36:34.109
<i>Clear.</i>

36:34.192 --> 36:36.194
<i>- It's empty.
- All clear.</i>

36:39.572 --> 36:42.158
- It's empty, sir.
<i>- Confirmed. All clear.</i>

36:51.376 --> 36:54.545
Francis, did they find...

36:54.629 --> 36:57.465
No.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.468
- I thought Ahmadi was going to...
- No, we are where we are.

37:00.551 --> 37:03.179
We knew it was a risk.

37:04.097 --> 37:06.182
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.228
Let's get you upstairs.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.017
<i>...by Tom Hammerschmidt, 15 minutes ago.</i>

37:49.100 --> 37:52.728
<i>In the article, it says the president
was asked to comment, but declined.</i>

37:52.813 --> 37:55.523
<i>Among those quoted
are ex-president Garrett Walker,</i>

37:55.606 --> 37:56.942
<i>Congresswoman Jackie...</i>

37:59.402 --> 38:01.362
How many phone calls
have you got so far?

38:03.824 --> 38:05.992
Uh, at least 30.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.996
- You?
- Ah, I stopped counting.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.918
Where should we go?

38:19.840 --> 38:21.091
Surprise me.

38:28.014 --> 38:30.183
No, we don't say anything.

38:30.266 --> 38:33.061
We'll let him burn in the lights
for a few days and see how this plays out.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.396
And then we blanket
every swing state with ads.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.649
Thirty seconds, in silence.
Just the headline.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.776
Let that sink into people's gray matter.

38:41.862 --> 38:42.904
Yeah.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.448
Okay.
We'll talk soon.

38:45.531 --> 38:48.159
Come here.
I wanna show you something.

38:48.784 --> 38:50.536
I'm still upset.

38:51.830 --> 38:54.082
You can't pretend that nothing's happened.

38:55.291 --> 38:58.253
I am not weak.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.214
I shouldn't have said that.
I know you're not.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.050
And here's something else I know.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.803
You're gonna be the next
First Lady of the United States.

39:24.154 --> 39:26.572
All right, stay in your office.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.242
I'll call you back in a bit.

39:33.204 --> 39:36.457
Some Prinivil and aspirin, please.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.014
It's out?

39:53.433 --> 39:55.560
Yes.

39:58.271 --> 40:01.691
Doug's got Macallan with him, too.

40:01.774 --> 40:04.610
They're expanding his program,
but without him in charge.

40:05.611 --> 40:07.363
So we're not safe there, either.

40:07.447 --> 40:08.907
Well, if he was...

40:10.241 --> 40:12.868
if he was there to manage it,
but he's not, so...

40:14.829 --> 40:16.706
No, we're not safe.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.508
- Should I call Dr. Saxon?
- No, it's not necessary.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.802
- Thank you very much. That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

40:42.065 --> 40:43.441
Three weeks...

40:45.986 --> 40:47.445
then the election.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.781
It's nothing.

40:53.826 --> 40:55.245
And then we lose.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.791
And they investigate.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.214
And everything we...

41:11.136 --> 41:12.803
Gone.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.477
I feel...

41:20.561 --> 41:22.480
numb.

41:23.939 --> 41:25.400
I do, too.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.831
We make time.

41:44.335 --> 41:49.049
We can't fight everything off
one by one, Francis.

41:51.634 --> 41:53.594
But if we make this...

41:56.556 --> 41:58.974
we make it work for us.

42:01.769 --> 42:03.396
Create chaos.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.274
More than chaos.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.621
War.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.624
Fear.

42:24.709 --> 42:25.835
Fear.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.255
Brutal.

42:31.882 --> 42:33.468
Total.

42:34.719 --> 42:38.181
I'm done trying
to win over people's hearts.

42:39.557 --> 42:42.143
Let's attack their hearts.

42:43.353 --> 42:45.188
We can work with fear.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.817
Yes, we can.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.498
You should put on a fresh suit.

43:07.377 --> 43:08.961
The navy blue.

43:09.670 --> 43:12.590
Yes, the navy blue.

43:18.221 --> 43:20.515
- Where's Macallan?
- We sent him home.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.933
All right, tell him to stay put.
We'll tackle that later.

43:23.017 --> 43:26.187
Have Seth inform the networks.
The Oval, one hour.

43:26.271 --> 43:28.314
- Do you need him to draft something?
- Tom will write it.

43:28.398 --> 43:31.192
- He's not here.
- Then get him here.

43:34.028 --> 43:36.614
What about the last part
that you crossed out?

43:36.697 --> 43:40.660
Uh, "To mourn is not to fear.
To grieve is not to admit defeat."

43:40.743 --> 43:42.328
You should keep that in.

43:42.412 --> 43:45.039
But it presumes he's going to die.

43:46.832 --> 43:48.459
He is going to die.

43:50.753 --> 43:53.256
We talk to the lawyers first,
then you can talk to the press.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.049
I've got major funders
pulling out already.

43:55.133 --> 43:56.884
The president should put in calls
to set them at ease.

43:56.967 --> 43:59.053
No. No calls.
The campaign's on hold.

43:59.137 --> 44:02.515
We lose that money, so be it.
We need to stabilize.

44:02.598 --> 44:05.310
I don't think he should say
the part about mourning and grief.

44:05.393 --> 44:08.020
I agree, but Yates said
they wanted it back in.

44:08.103 --> 44:09.189
Is it true?

44:10.273 --> 44:13.276
What Hammerschmidt wrote?
Is it?

44:13.359 --> 44:14.402
No.

44:15.445 --> 44:19.240
That's the first time you've lied to me...
since you stopped lying to me.

44:33.128 --> 44:37.342
My fellow Americans,
over the past two years,

44:37.425 --> 44:39.802
certainly within
the last several days and hours,

44:39.885 --> 44:43.639
I have asked myself,
"What does it mean to be president?

44:43.723 --> 44:46.434
What does true leadership look like?"

44:46.517 --> 44:49.604
It's a question many of you
have asked yourselves

44:49.687 --> 44:51.231
as November approaches.

44:51.314 --> 44:55.526
Right now, as I sit in this chair,
in this office,

44:55.610 --> 44:57.445
where so many of my predecessors

44:57.528 --> 45:00.906
have steered our nation
through turbulent times...

45:00.990 --> 45:05.870
I realize that this job is one
that transcends politics and rhetoric.

45:05.953 --> 45:09.374
<i>Entrusted to anyone
who sits behind this desk</i>

45:09.457 --> 45:14.337
<i>is something far more elemental,
the very survival of our nation.</i>

45:15.170 --> 45:20.468
<i>And I, as your president,
must confront the storm before us.</i>

45:20.551 --> 45:22.970
<i>That storm is terror.</i>

45:23.053 --> 45:26.516
More dangerous and unpredictable
than any hurricane.

45:26.599 --> 45:31.186
It has endangered us abroad.
It has endangered us at home.

45:31.271 --> 45:36.066
And right now, it has placed James Miller
in the gravest of dangers.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.612
<i>We attempted to communicate
with his captors.</i>

45:39.695 --> 45:42.698
<i>We hoped for a peaceful solution.</i>

45:42.782 --> 45:48.162
<i>We're relieved that Caroline
and Melissa Miller are safe and sound.</i>

45:48.245 --> 45:52.542
<i>But terror is blind to reason.</i>

45:52.625 --> 45:57.755
<i>Given the opportunity to renounce terror,
Yusuf Al Ahmadi chose to encourage it.</i>

45:57.838 --> 46:00.675
<i>So, unfortunately,</i>

46:00.758 --> 46:04.554
<i>we must now move beyond reason.</i>

46:04.637 --> 46:06.806
<i>We must respond with force.</i>

46:06.889 --> 46:11.143
Because there is no scenario
in which we will release him.

46:11.226 --> 46:15.147
He will remain in United States custody
until his dying breath.

46:15.815 --> 46:19.902
If the captors call again,
we will not answer.

46:19.985 --> 46:25.157
The time for conversation is over,
no matter the consequences.

46:25.240 --> 46:29.119
Regardless of whether James Miller
is released or not,

46:29.203 --> 46:31.246
rescued or not,

46:31.331 --> 46:32.873
killed or not...

46:33.624 --> 46:36.377
ICO will be destroyed.

46:37.628 --> 46:40.798
We are at war.

46:40.881 --> 46:43.133
It will be a war more total

46:43.217 --> 46:48.305
than anything we have waged thus far
in the fight against extremism.

46:48.389 --> 46:50.433
Soldiers will die.

46:50.516 --> 46:52.852
Civilians may die.

46:52.935 --> 46:57.147
There will be pain.
There will be suffering.

46:57.231 --> 47:02.236
We will be confronted with
the most horrific aspects of humanity.

47:02.319 --> 47:05.698
We will confront the inhuman.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.033
Evil itself.

47:08.117 --> 47:10.703
But we will triumph.

47:10.786 --> 47:13.831
It is not a war we will lose.

47:15.124 --> 47:18.503
And if the worst happens
to James Miller...

47:18.586 --> 47:20.505
we must remember,

47:20.588 --> 47:26.552
To mourn is not to fear.
To grieve is not to admit defeat.

47:26.636 --> 47:28.679
God bless America,

47:28.763 --> 47:33.058
and all of those
who believe in freedom and democracy.

47:36.228 --> 47:38.108
- Any news?
- They just posted on Twitter.

47:38.188 --> 47:41.233
9:00 sharp, live on the Internet.
We won't find them before that.

47:41.316 --> 47:43.528
Do we have the capability
to block the video?

47:43.611 --> 47:45.154
Well, we might be able
to block some sites,

47:45.237 --> 47:48.115
- but if they have enough mirrors...
- Don't block anything.

47:48.198 --> 47:49.492
Yes, sir.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.038
The whole world should watch this.

47:54.955 --> 47:56.457
And we should, too.

48:03.548 --> 48:07.802
- What you said, "We're at war..."
- I want to build a coalition.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.554
- More air strikes?
- Ground, air...

48:09.637 --> 48:11.263
The full force of our military.

48:11.346 --> 48:13.933
Well, I wish you would have
consulted first.

48:14.016 --> 48:17.520
- This type of escalation...
- Not escalation, Cathy. Obliteration.

48:19.396 --> 48:21.649
This is
your response to the article?

48:22.567 --> 48:24.109
We're doing what's necessary.

48:30.575 --> 48:34.411
When you find them...
you will kill them.

48:35.329 --> 48:38.207
If we're able to apprehend alive,
we may get...

48:40.501 --> 48:42.252
I understand, Mr. President.

48:43.378 --> 48:44.755
Sir?

48:48.884 --> 48:52.137
I wanna be 100%.
I can give you that.

48:52.221 --> 48:55.182
But it's gonna be a lot harder if I...

48:55.265 --> 48:58.060
If you want me here by your side,
I will be.

48:58.143 --> 49:00.312
- But I'd prefer...
- No.

49:00.395 --> 49:03.858
You do what you have to do.
Be back when it's over.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.860
I will.
Thank you, sir.

49:24.504 --> 49:26.631
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:27.548 --> 49:30.217
Do you want to come inside?

49:30.300 --> 49:33.262
- The kids there?
- Yeah.

49:35.180 --> 49:37.474
- You're not letting them watch...
- No.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.310
No, I forbade them to.

49:42.021 --> 49:45.274
Although, I mean, with school and...
and their friends,

49:45.357 --> 49:48.443
it'll be impossible to prevent if...

49:48.528 --> 49:50.279
if they really wanna see it.

49:52.948 --> 49:54.491
They all right?

49:55.618 --> 49:57.077
Are you all right?

49:58.996 --> 50:00.330
I will be.

50:02.082 --> 50:03.333
I have to be.

50:14.011 --> 50:16.513
All these people in their houses...

50:18.641 --> 50:20.768
about to see this awful thing...

50:21.769 --> 50:24.354
that they'll never be able to erase.

50:27.775 --> 50:31.278
Were you there,
when your husband died?

50:33.238 --> 50:34.990
In the room?

50:38.493 --> 50:39.912
No.

50:52.758 --> 50:55.260
Have you ever watched someone die?

51:13.070 --> 51:15.530
I know you gotta go
back there tonight...

51:16.448 --> 51:17.992
but when you're done...

51:18.909 --> 51:20.577
whenever that is...

51:21.495 --> 51:22.747
you're staying here.

51:39.013 --> 51:41.056
<i>We do this in the name of
the Islamic Caliphate,</i>

51:41.140 --> 51:44.852
<i>in the name of Yusuf Al Ahmadi,
in the name of God.</i>

51:44.935 --> 51:46.896
<i>Melissa, I love you.</i>

51:46.979 --> 51:48.397
<i>Caroline, I love you.</i>

51:48.480 --> 51:49.774
<i>Please, dear God, look out...</i>

52:06.581 --> 52:09.418
Turn off the sound.

52:20.680 --> 52:22.139
That's right.

52:24.391 --> 52:26.226
We don't submit to terror.

52:31.523 --> 52:33.358
We make the terror.
