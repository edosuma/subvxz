03:02.416 --> 03:05.853
Did you get it? Did
you get it on camera?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.488
No.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.822
Do you believe?

03:08.856 --> 03:12.926
I believe...I believe
it was a man in a monkey suit.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.931
There's no such thing as Bigfoot
and there's no such thing as

03:17.965 --> 03:22.403
Zombies, but that? That was no
man in a monkey suit!

03:38.686 --> 03:43.557
Now before you get your hopes
up, allow me to empty my cup.

03:43.591 --> 03:48.662
I am not a superhero.
I am not a superstar.

03:48.696 --> 03:53.367
I'm the guy you ask to help you
move. I'm the guy you meet at

03:53.401 --> 03:57.638
your local bar. And I am no
boyscout, all dressed up for

03:57.671 --> 04:02.510
show and go, oh no. In my little
head my Grandma's warning

04:02.543 --> 04:11.218
echoes from long ago. Michael,
remember: you reap what you sow.

04:11.251 --> 04:19.860
Mr. Thornton, I'm leaving now...
I have tickets to the theater.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.632
Michael?

04:24.665 --> 04:28.235
Go ahead, have a good night.

04:28.268 --> 04:32.840
And Michael? I realize this may
not be convenient but

04:32.873 --> 04:35.876
I'd like to ask for a raise.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.913
Before you say anything,
I'm very proficient with

04:39.947 --> 04:44.485
my duties and the clients
like me very much.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.287
Little people...

04:47.321 --> 04:50.257
You mean like- what, children?

04:50.290 --> 04:54.528
Yes, children. And I'm told,
dogs like me very much.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.897
You don't see
me asking for a raise.

04:56.930 --> 05:00.601
I hear in Europe you get a raise the 
very first day you start a job.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.904
Now why doesn't that
surprise me?

05:03.937 --> 05:06.273
What kind of raise
are we talking?

05:06.306 --> 05:10.310
I don't know, nothing grand or
obnoxious. Just something that

05:10.344 --> 05:14.281
says you appreciate me and my efforts
 and my many, many talents.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.284
Can't I just say I do appreciate
you and be done with it?

05:17.317 --> 05:21.689
No, it doesn't work that way,
Michael - You should know that.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.291
Besides, I thought you said you
were in a good mood today.

05:24.324 --> 05:29.997
Good moods. Yeah, I am in a good
mood. Go ahead, give yourself

05:30.030 --> 05:33.300
a raise and I'll sign it
on Monday morning.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.537
Well, and now you can now count
me among the many dogs and

05:36.570 --> 05:41.409
children that like you. And our
dear dear Mother would be

05:41.442 --> 05:46.313
very pleased with your
generosity.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.316
Enjoy your show. Sis.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.720
Have a pleasant weekend,
Mr. Thornton.

06:13.373 --> 06:17.344
Hey Bumble, it's the First day of summer. Can you believe it?

06:17.377 --> 06:20.347
I can believe it.
Longest day of the year.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.349
And a beautiful day it is.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.852
And already the crazies are out.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.754
You mean my ex-wife's
back in town?

06:27.921 --> 06:28.922
Please explain.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.958
You haven't heard
about the sightings?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.225
Go on.

06:32.259 --> 06:33.894
It seems Bigfoot is baacckk!

06:33.927 --> 06:35.195
You don't say?

06:35.228 --> 06:38.799
I do say. It seems Sasquatch is
alive and well. Multiple

06:38.832 --> 06:41.569
sightings in the last three
days. Although some say it

06:41.602 --> 06:44.371
looked like an escaped
ape or a gorilla.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.673
Is there a difference?

06:45.706 --> 06:49.777
Ah- beats me but one man says
his two dogs are missing.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.580
And he thinks Bigfoot did
it? What kind of dogs?

06:52.613 --> 06:55.549
Large ones, German
Shepherds. They were outside

06:55.583 --> 06:58.919
barking up a storm last
night. When one of them

06:58.952 --> 07:01.722
yelped - he went outside.
No dogs, Nein!

07:01.755 --> 07:03.791
Not even a trace of the dogs.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.860
Yeah, well it's been a long
winter. Perhaps he ate his dogs.

07:06.894 --> 07:08.261
Oh-

07:08.295 --> 07:10.030
Hey if you see two large German
Shepherd dogs goose-stepping it

07:10.063 --> 07:14.835
through the woods give us a
call. But if you see Bigfoot...

07:16.436 --> 07:18.405
Runnnn!!!

07:18.438 --> 07:19.840
And now back to some
summer music.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.415
Hello!

07:28.448 --> 07:31.118
Hi, uh- welcome to my home

07:31.151 --> 07:34.622
Oh this is quite lovely.

07:34.655 --> 07:39.993
Uh, where would you uh- like to
conduct the interview? I thought

07:40.027 --> 07:42.429
maybe the- the living room
would be most suitable.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.064
Oh this is just delightful.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.934
What if we have her seated in
front of the fireplace?

07:49.469 --> 07:51.772
Hello this is Phil Philbin, and
I have the remarkable

07:51.805 --> 07:54.942
opportunity of being in the
lovely home of famed author,

07:54.975 --> 07:59.780
Li Wei. Ms. Wei has agreed to
tell us her extraordinary

07:59.813 --> 08:04.985
happenstance on camera
in this exclusive interview.

08:05.018 --> 08:08.856
Li could you tell us your
experience exactly

08:08.889 --> 08:11.024
as it unfolded.

08:11.058 --> 08:17.030
Um- well we were uh- on our
usual thursday afternoon hike,

08:17.064 --> 08:22.035
and in no time we were very
much alone in the wilderness.

08:22.069 --> 08:28.709
There was a low growl from the
growth in front of me, and I-

08:28.742 --> 08:37.751
I know it was not from a small
animal and I was- I was frozen

08:37.784 --> 08:45.626
in my spot and then it appeared.

08:53.133 --> 08:58.105
and I just... I came to the
ravine, and I didn't know where

08:58.138 --> 09:06.179
to go. I was freefalling, just
50 feet straight down, and I

09:06.213 --> 09:11.652
don't know if I jumped or the
creature shoved me, but I was...

09:11.685 --> 09:13.320
I blacked out and-

09:14.321 --> 09:19.927
I- when I came to I was in a
creek and the smell was gone.

09:19.960 --> 09:24.297
so I surmised that the
creature had also vanished.

09:24.331 --> 09:30.638
Now was this when,
this happened?

09:45.018 --> 09:49.857
Yes, this- this is what I
got for my efforts.

09:49.890 --> 09:53.593
Well it- it could've
been much worse.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.998
Yes, I could have died.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.566
And then?

09:59.599 --> 10:03.036
And that's when I called you.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.842
What did you say?

10:08.876 --> 10:16.049
I- I said, beware the
woods. Be- beware the woods.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.150
Are you at the cabin?

11:57.184 --> 11:57.985
I am.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.152
Is she on her way?

11:59.186 --> 12:00.253
She is.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.089
Are you still going
through with it?

12:02.122 --> 12:02.990
Look Jerry...

12:05.258 --> 12:09.396
After Jessica died I thought
about her every single day.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.299
And I'll be the first to admit
my second marriage was a

12:12.332 --> 12:17.437
huge mistake... but
Sara...Sara's different.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.307
I think I'm very much in love.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.110
And you're not too
proud to admint it.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.144
Third time's the charm huh?

12:24.177 --> 12:24.878
You said it.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.313
Do you have a ring?

12:26.346 --> 12:27.480
Of course.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.149
I'll pop the question tonight.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.384
And she'll say yes.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.287
Are you on your way to another
happy hour at Rick's bar?

12:34.321 --> 12:37.825
No, I'm on my way to the cabin,
Your cabin. I've got some docs

12:37.858 --> 12:40.794
you have to sign off on.
They have to be delivered

12:40.828 --> 12:44.497
tomorrow morning, it's very,
very important to us.

12:44.531 --> 12:48.335
I thought we were
fine. After last week?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.037
Bad news good news.

12:50.070 --> 12:54.808
They started seizing our assets
but stopped abruptly. I moved

12:54.842 --> 12:57.310
all that I could without
waving a red flag to the IRS

12:57.344 --> 12:58.478
to come and arrest us.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.813
How bad is it?

12:59.847 --> 13:03.750
You mean how bad was it. On a
scale of 1-10 it was a 10+.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.186
We're lucky the Russian's
didn't bury us at the bottom

13:06.219 --> 13:12.125
of Castaic- Uh- Sorry, um- I
should'nt've said that.

13:12.159 --> 13:15.829
Look with a little maneuvering
and some timing, we'll survive

13:15.863 --> 13:17.464
this and be better than ever.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.866
That's good to hear.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.267
I don't know how you managed it.
You

13:20.300 --> 13:24.404
must be the luckiest guy I know.
Russians usually don't give up.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.939
Cut off the head.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.274
What's that?

13:27.975 --> 13:29.776
Mike-

13:29.809 --> 13:31.311
Yeah?

13:31.344 --> 13:34.447
Well I hate to ask but are
they uh- still looking for him?

13:34.481 --> 13:37.184
No they think he doesn't
want to be found.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.286
Ooh and we certainly don't
want him to be found.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.322
Not on the phone Jerry.

13:42.956 --> 13:45.859
Well how's uh-
how's Sara doing?

13:45.893 --> 13:47.794
She thinks he's
gone into hiding.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.131
Oh that's good, that's good.
See time heals all wounds.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.866
When will you be here?

13:52.900 --> 13:56.904
Well, traffic's a bitch.
Probably two or three hours.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.238
Sara?

13:58.271 --> 14:00.040
Within the hour.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.041
Well-

14:01.074 --> 14:04.011
say hello for me until
I can say it myself.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.312
I'll do that.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.581
Oh and Mike- Congratulations.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.517
Thanks.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.367
Michael?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.834
I'm here.

15:01.868 --> 15:02.936
Hey, I just wanted to let
you know I'm going to be

15:02.970 --> 15:05.038
a little late. Traffic sucks.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.273
So I've heard.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.642
I can't wait to see you.
Are you okay?

15:12.912 --> 15:16.449
If I lost- If I lost everything

15:17.384 --> 15:19.686
I'd love you even more.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.589
Hey what's happening?

15:22.622 --> 15:26.994
Nothing to worry about. Jerry
says we have it under control.

15:27.027 --> 15:30.097
I just want you to know
that no matter what,

15:30.130 --> 15:34.201
I will always love you. It
doesn' t matter what happens.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.404
I'll see you soon Michael.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.640
See you soon.

15:45.112 --> 15:49.216
You are one of the World's
Authorities on these creatures?

15:49.249 --> 15:54.054
Well I am the world's foremost
authority on the cryptid hominid

15:54.087 --> 15:59.226
or gigantophithecus canadensis
uh- or in lay terms;

15:59.259 --> 16:02.962
The Sasquatch and it's more
guttural cousin; Bigfoot-

16:02.996 --> 16:07.134
And we also must include the
Yeti in any discussions of

16:07.167 --> 16:11.038
scientific merit - And I am
slightly taken aback at the

16:11.071 --> 16:15.108
robust renewed interest in
these wonderful creatures.

16:15.142 --> 16:20.080
Lovely, lovely...And you say you
can imitate their sounds?

16:20.113 --> 16:25.085
Oh sounds? Oh- Of course. Uh-
and if I may say so, I am an

16:25.118 --> 16:26.953
expert in all three.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.590
Oh- Could you give us an actual
demonstration if needed?

16:30.623 --> 16:34.194
Demonstration? Oh, I'm
very flattered that you've

16:34.227 --> 16:39.632
asked. Um- I
will first do the Yeti.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.278
And now the Sasquatch.

16:56.216 --> 17:00.520
And now the 'piece de
resistance', the Bigfoot.

17:08.127 --> 17:13.665
Have you- Have you ever actually
seen one of these creatures?

17:13.700 --> 17:22.642
Oh- um- alas no. Uh- never.
But I do believe with my

17:22.675 --> 17:28.281
whole heart, that I will one day
walk hand in hand with them.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.049
In my next lifetime.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.485
I'm sure the feeling is mutual.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.322
I'm just saying, any animal
that is teased long enough

17:35.355 --> 17:36.756
will attack you.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.092
What about a shark, a shark is
going to attack you whether

17:39.126 --> 17:40.560
you tease it or not.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.362
I'm not talking about a shark,
I'm talking about a land animal.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.165
Is a shark considered to be an
animal? I know it's a fish

17:45.198 --> 17:46.199
but is it an animal?

17:46.233 --> 17:46.866
I think so.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.934
Yeah. I think so too.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.702
So what's the difference
between a Yeti,

17:49.736 --> 17:51.504
a Sasquatch, and Bigfoot?

17:51.538 --> 17:55.242
Alright so a Yeti is like the
abominable snow man. He's all

17:55.275 --> 17:56.409
white and he lives in the snow.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.744
Agreed.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.213
A Sasquatch makes its'
home in the Redwoods.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.314
Also agreed.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.415
But Bigfoot...

18:02.449 --> 18:04.083
Bigfoot can live anywhere.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.219
Give the lady a prize.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.520
Why are we here again?

18:07.554 --> 18:10.390
Two hundred dollars a
pound for morel mushrooms.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.524
And where are these fungi?

18:11.558 --> 18:12.525
There's a fungus among us...

18:12.559 --> 18:13.793
It should be just over this way.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.335
Oh my God. What is that?

18:29.509 --> 18:31.611
Well is it human or animal?

18:31.644 --> 18:33.513
I guess now we know
why they call it Bigfoot.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.253
Good morning. Coffee?

19:14.621 --> 19:17.690
Sorry I'm not a stalker I just
see you in this coffee shop

19:17.724 --> 19:21.528
all the time and I wanted
to say hi. I'm Sara.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.503
To you whenever you arrive.

20:24.357 --> 20:25.392
Michael?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.315
Cheers.

20:59.659 --> 21:02.429
Well it's about time.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.669
What happened?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.541
Why?

21:30.523 --> 21:31.524
Sara?

21:33.893 --> 21:40.066
Michael...

22:11.664 --> 22:13.400
Sara!

23:55.868 --> 23:56.903
What nationality are you?

23:56.936 --> 23:58.638
I'm a purebred mutt.

23:59.872 --> 24:03.543
I'm Russian. Purebred Russian

24:03.576 --> 24:05.444
Where's your accent?

24:05.478 --> 24:08.648
My father inssisted that I go to
only the best schools, and

24:08.681 --> 24:11.450
that meant you know my accent
was the first thing to go.

24:13.753 --> 24:19.091
I think you might like my dad. I
think he might like you too.

24:19.125 --> 24:24.997
You guys are both... Well I
mean you- you heard the rumors.

24:26.599 --> 24:29.035
Guys like me don't get here
without doing things-

24:29.068 --> 24:31.804
a bit differently.

24:31.838 --> 24:36.776
My mom used to say- A man
can never truly find himself

24:36.809 --> 24:39.646
until he is reduced
to his most basic self.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.213
And what does that mean?

24:41.247 --> 24:46.152
I don't know but it seemed like
the appropriate time to say it.

24:50.723 --> 24:53.092
I want you to meet my family.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.994
That's a big step isn't it.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.163
If you're scared its a big step.

24:57.196 --> 25:01.901
If you're a big strong man I
think you can handle it.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.903
Are you a big
strong man Michael.

25:03.936 --> 25:06.939
I have my moments.

27:02.154 --> 27:04.123
Sara!

27:27.814 --> 27:31.317
Hi, this is Michael. With any
luck I'm out having a

27:31.350 --> 27:35.021
great time. Leave your sunny
message after the tone.

27:36.322 --> 27:43.763
Michael, it's your sis. I
realize that you're in the

27:43.796 --> 27:48.400
throes of impending marital
bliss, but I just wanted to call

27:48.434 --> 27:53.105
and wish you every happiness.
I'm certain that Sara will

27:53.139 --> 27:58.144
give you everything that you
deserve. And Michael...

27:58.177 --> 28:02.381
Even if there's a couple of
bumps along the road,

28:02.414 --> 28:05.417
I have no doubt that you
two can smooth it over.

28:07.186 --> 28:13.826
Well, I guess that's it for now
dear brother. I love you. Ta ta.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.406
I'm getting dizzy Michael.

28:29.375 --> 28:34.146
Will you catch me if I fall?
Because I'm falling Michael.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.115
I'm falling for you!

28:44.791 --> 28:46.125
Sara!

29:04.276 --> 29:06.278
Sara!

29:10.116 --> 29:13.219
You can survive
days without food.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.487
But you cannot survive
without water.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.323
If you wouldn't have forgotten
the water we would have

29:17.356 --> 29:18.858
no problems right now.

29:18.891 --> 29:22.094
No problems? You don't even know where we are. Who doesn't

29:22.128 --> 29:24.330
bring a map or a cell phone?

29:24.363 --> 29:27.266
Why would I want some
kind of electronic device

29:27.299 --> 29:30.236
out here amongst all
this natural beauty?

29:30.269 --> 29:32.438
It's the antithesis of why
we came out here.

29:32.471 --> 29:35.975
And I'm just realizing how
truly clueless you really are.

29:36.008 --> 29:39.045
First rule of hiking, know where
you are at all times.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.312
Well where's your cell phone?

29:40.346 --> 29:42.815
In the car which we
can't find because of you.

29:42.849 --> 29:45.317
Why did I even agree to
this? I don't like hiking.

29:45.351 --> 29:48.754
Hiking is fine as long as you
remember the water.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.122
You're an idiot.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.091
You know what, name calling is
going to do nothing to help us.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.125
Idiot.

29:54.393 --> 29:58.130
Alright alright, I'll make you a
deal. If you get us out of here,

29:58.164 --> 29:59.598
I'll stop calling you names.

29:59.631 --> 30:06.338
I highly doubt that- but sure.
You've got yourself a deal.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.374
Mind if we keep moving?

30:11.377 --> 30:13.812
Look lights.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.547
Is that a cabin?

30:15.581 --> 30:19.518
Yeah I think it is. I can
taste the water from here.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.354
I take it back. No deal.
You really are an idiot.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.791
What is that awful smell?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.927
It's got to be a
dead animal around here.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.429
I think I'm going to be sick.

30:33.065 --> 30:34.400
What is that?

30:36.368 --> 30:37.403
What is that?

30:41.908 --> 30:43.075
Help me.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.511
Help me!

32:53.172 --> 32:55.974
Where are we going
with all this Michael.

32:58.310 --> 33:02.714
I've fallen in love with you.
I didn't mean for it to happen,

33:02.748 --> 33:07.986
It just did. What
about you Michael.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.692
I know you've been married.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.261
Twice.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.633
Care to try for three?

33:24.136 --> 33:25.671
Daddy wants to meet you.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.173
Why?

33:27.206 --> 33:29.475
Because I've told him about you.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.678
He's my father Michael.
He's very protective

33:32.711 --> 33:36.348
of his little girl. Meeting you
would give him some comfort.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.617
You'd want to protect me right?

33:42.788 --> 33:46.024
It's time Michael. You can't
hide from him forever.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.462
Buck up Bucko

34:01.373 --> 34:02.241
Name?

34:02.274 --> 34:04.210
Michael Thornton.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.245
You're on the list Mr. Thornton.

34:45.284 --> 34:48.687
Michael, finally, hurry.
Daddy's waiting.

34:54.426 --> 34:58.364
Daddy, This is Michael.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.099
So this is the bastard who
wants to steal my daughter?

35:01.133 --> 35:04.636
Hey, don't intimidate him.
He's not like the others.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.144
He likes you.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.848
So you are a business man?

35:16.882 --> 35:17.883
I try.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.552
We know all about
you Michael Thornton.

35:20.586 --> 35:22.521
You didn't think I
would allow just anyone

35:22.554 --> 35:24.122
to sleep with my daughter?

35:24.156 --> 35:26.492
You have made money
and lost money.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.427
That is the way of
business. Am I correct?

35:28.460 --> 35:29.628
He is correct.

35:29.661 --> 35:32.731
But we are in the business of
making money all the time.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.100
That is why you are here.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.468
We want to include you.

35:36.502 --> 35:39.137
Any man that wants to be
with my daughter must give her

35:39.171 --> 35:41.106
the lifestyle she deserves.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.109
And our business together
will benefit your lifestyle.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.211
Greatly.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.479
You are a lucky man,
Michael Thornton.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.281
A very lucky man.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.483
Enjoy the rest of
the evening, Michael.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.352
And be very good to my daughter.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.387
Your life depends on it.

35:55.787 --> 35:58.457
Michael. He make joke.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.764
You may leave now, Michael.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.804
Daddy really likes you.

36:12.838 --> 36:14.406
How can you tell?

36:14.440 --> 36:16.442
He's quick to judge.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.211
He's really quick to judge.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.514
But he likes you.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.715
Is that a good thing?

36:23.749 --> 36:25.484
Yeah, that's a good thing.

36:26.418 --> 36:27.586
Maybe he'll even
get you involved

36:27.619 --> 36:28.720
in some of his business.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.922
Daddy's really good at business.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.359
So he tells me.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.827
What's with those accents?

36:35.861 --> 36:37.696
Sometimes it's better if people

36:37.729 --> 36:39.731
don't know you're Russian.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.735
I like your laugh.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.806
Well, that's good to know.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.841
In fact, I like a lot about you.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.543
You sound so shocked.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.312
Oh, I am shocked, Sara.

36:53.345 --> 36:54.446
I am shocked.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.948
She bit off her own
finger to get to mine?

37:36.555 --> 37:39.558
Out of sight, out of mind.

38:10.322 --> 38:11.323
Groaning, grunting.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.938
Ahhhh!!

40:11.510 --> 40:13.912
Buck up, Bucko.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.051
You know everyone.

41:26.885 --> 41:28.219
Make drink.

41:29.054 --> 41:31.657
It is important to
us to have your loyalty.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.525
Unquestioned loyalty.

41:33.559 --> 41:35.226
You have a problem with that?

41:35.260 --> 41:38.229
We have a new proposition
for you. For all of us.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.565
It'll make you wealthy.

41:39.598 --> 41:41.066
And the three of us wealthier.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.467
But you...

41:42.500 --> 41:44.235
...you are the unknown link.

41:44.269 --> 41:47.472
We don't want you to be
the weakest link, Michael.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.506
Vodka.

41:49.908 --> 41:52.944
Let me tell you story
about guy who sell his soul

41:52.978 --> 41:54.112
to highest bidders.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.513
That is you, Michael.

41:55.547 --> 41:58.550
You're selling your soul to us.

42:54.572 --> 42:57.575
And this little piggy goes
into the champagne bucket

44:48.286 --> 44:49.254
What is it, Michael?

44:49.287 --> 44:51.890
You look like a man who
just lost his puppy.

44:51.923 --> 44:53.424
It's an easy job.

44:53.458 --> 44:56.261
You don't have a problem with
that. It'll make you rich.

44:56.294 --> 44:57.929
They own a jewelry store.

44:57.963 --> 44:59.765
They're from the old country.

44:59.798 --> 45:02.267
There's a large safe in
the back of the store.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.269
They don't believe in banks.

45:04.302 --> 45:06.838
We have guy inside.
He show you safe.

45:06.872 --> 45:08.439
You'll already
have the combination.

45:08.473 --> 45:09.975
You will unlock safe.

45:10.008 --> 45:11.709
Listen to me carefully, Michael.

45:11.743 --> 45:13.344
I'm only going to say this once.

45:13.378 --> 45:17.215
Inside the safe you will find
cash and a large envelope.

45:17.248 --> 45:19.751
Do not look
inside the envelope.

45:19.785 --> 45:21.753
Bring it back to us unopened.

45:21.787 --> 45:24.355
You can keep the cash you find.

45:24.389 --> 45:25.356
How much cash?

45:25.390 --> 45:28.159
Ha! See, now we have interest.

45:28.193 --> 45:30.028
Three mill, maybe five.

45:30.061 --> 45:32.230
Keep the cash.
But the envelope...

45:32.263 --> 45:33.231
The envelope...

45:33.264 --> 45:35.266
...you bring back to us.

45:35.767 --> 45:39.805
Now you are one of us, Michael.

45:45.877 --> 45:47.445
Self protection, huh?

45:47.478 --> 45:49.147
I understand that.

45:49.180 --> 45:51.249
We all need protection today.

45:51.282 --> 45:53.284
Am I right or am I right?

45:53.919 --> 45:55.053
Now this baby...

45:55.086 --> 45:58.256
this here is The
Terminator of all handguns.

45:58.289 --> 46:01.860
It'll blow a hole so big in a
man, you gonna see Alaska, baby.

46:05.296 --> 46:08.299
And ain't nobody getting up
after you use that cannon.

46:11.803 --> 46:15.006
Five hundred. And I will
throw in a box of pasta shells.

46:16.942 --> 46:18.543
Have I seen you before?

46:19.845 --> 46:21.847
You know, you got
the look of a killa'?

46:22.247 --> 46:24.415
I don't mean that in a bad way.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.251
You got the look of a
man who if he's pushed

46:26.284 --> 46:28.319
just a little too far...

46:28.353 --> 46:31.122
Yeah...you got the look
of a stone cold killa'.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.025
I think I made a big mistake.

46:34.059 --> 46:35.226
Oh, baby...

46:35.260 --> 46:37.428
the only mistake you're gonna
make is walking out that door.

46:37.462 --> 46:40.131
There comes a time when
everyone, and I mean everyone,

46:40.165 --> 46:42.167
wishes they had a gun.

46:47.873 --> 46:49.007
It's an easy job.

46:49.040 --> 46:50.541
They own a jewelry store.

46:50.575 --> 46:52.210
They don't believe in banks.

46:52.243 --> 46:53.912
It'll make you rich.

46:53.945 --> 46:56.481
We have guy inside.
He show you safe.

46:56.514 --> 46:58.516
You can keep the cash you find.

46:58.549 --> 47:00.886
Three mill, maybe five.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.921
Now you are one of us, Michael.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.358
So who died and left you king?

47:07.926 --> 47:09.027
Nice, huh?

47:09.060 --> 47:12.297
Better than nice.
This is fantastic!

47:13.131 --> 47:15.133
How can we afford it?

47:15.333 --> 47:16.868
Should I ask how?

47:16.902 --> 47:18.904
I made a deal
with Sara's father.

47:18.937 --> 47:22.140
I see. What kind of deal?

47:22.173 --> 47:24.509
Relax, Jerry.
No strings attached.

47:24.542 --> 47:27.412
The important thing is that the
company is once again healthy.

47:27.445 --> 47:30.015
Well Mike, I don't want to rain
on your parade but there are

47:30.048 --> 47:33.418
good Russians and
there are bad Russians.

47:33.451 --> 47:36.021
which one is he?

47:36.054 --> 47:37.923
Maybe I don't want to know.

47:37.956 --> 47:40.258
Just don't let him...

47:40.291 --> 47:42.060
Ha ha ha! Wow!

47:42.093 --> 47:45.096
This is a great view.

47:45.130 --> 47:46.464
Maybe I should learn to
speak Russian

47:46.497 --> 47:48.499
so I can properly thank him.

47:48.967 --> 47:49.968
Them.

47:50.868 --> 47:51.869
Them?

47:53.638 --> 47:55.506
Oh, it's a them now.

47:56.074 --> 47:57.508
What happened to her father?

47:57.542 --> 47:59.144
He has partners, Jerry.

47:59.177 --> 48:02.380
Mm..hm...Russian partners?

48:03.581 --> 48:06.184
Don't get me wrong. Good
Russians make good partners.

48:06.217 --> 48:08.153
But bad Russians...

48:08.186 --> 48:11.389
Bad Russians will leave us at
the bottom of the harbor.

48:11.422 --> 48:14.092
What are you worried about?
You know how to swim.

48:14.125 --> 48:17.228
Not with a hundred pound
weight cemented to my feet.

48:17.895 --> 48:21.032
Then let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

48:21.066 --> 48:23.068
Oh yeah, let's hope...

48:24.169 --> 48:29.507
Well, maybe, just maybe,
this will all be worth it.

48:31.576 --> 48:33.011
Hey...

48:33.044 --> 48:35.613
I'm gonna need
a new wardrobe.

48:35.646 --> 48:38.149
Yes you are, Jerry.
Yes you are.

48:38.183 --> 48:40.185
Ha ha! Excellent.

50:37.768 --> 50:39.370
Jerry!

50:46.111 --> 50:48.079
What are you doing?

50:48.113 --> 50:50.115
It's your fiancée.

51:13.738 --> 51:15.740
Jerry!

52:10.661 --> 52:13.198
9-1-1, please state the
nature of your emergency.

52:13.231 --> 52:14.832
My fiancée, she's...

52:14.865 --> 52:16.867
Please state your emergency.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.836
She's--she has
rabies or something

52:18.869 --> 52:20.671
Sir, please state your emergency.

52:20.705 --> 52:21.772
She's trying to kill me.

52:21.806 --> 52:23.274
Who is trying to kill you, sir?

52:23.308 --> 52:24.442
My fiancée!

52:24.475 --> 52:26.611
In what way is she
trying to kill you, sir?

52:28.413 --> 52:29.847
She's trying to
bite me to death.

52:29.880 --> 52:33.184
Sir, we have had an overload
of prank calls tonight.

52:33.218 --> 52:35.820
Calling 911 as
a joke is a crime.

52:35.853 --> 52:37.054
It is a felony.

52:37.087 --> 52:39.424
I have two fingers and my big
toe in the freezer

52:39.457 --> 52:41.559
to prove to you
this is no damn joke!

52:41.592 --> 52:42.760
What was that?

52:42.793 --> 52:43.861
She's trying to get in.

52:45.530 --> 52:46.797
Where are you now?

52:47.265 --> 52:48.633
I'm locked in the bathroom.

52:48.666 --> 52:50.235
Sir, listen to me...

52:50.268 --> 52:52.837
We have been inundated
tonight with strange calls.

52:52.870 --> 52:55.873
But I will have a patrol car
to you as soon as possible.

52:56.674 --> 52:59.910
What is your address?

52:59.944 --> 53:02.680
33430 Rustic Canyon Drive

53:02.713 --> 53:05.550
Do not open that door
until the police arrive.

53:05.583 --> 53:07.618
Do you understand?

53:07.652 --> 53:08.619
Do you understand?!

53:08.653 --> 53:09.654
I'm not an idiot!

53:14.825 --> 53:17.628
1 Adam 4, 1 Adam 4 do you copy?

53:20.431 --> 53:23.534
Adam 4, this is
Dispatch. Do you copy?

53:24.469 --> 53:28.273
Damn. Is she trying to
kill my buzz? Really?

53:28.306 --> 53:32.910
1 Adam 4, this is
Dispatch. Do you copy?

53:33.811 --> 53:36.947
Better answer her.
She'll never leave us alone.

53:40.851 --> 53:45.790
Uh...10-4 Dispatch.
We copy. Loud and clear.

53:46.824 --> 53:49.894
Be advised, we have a
domestic disturbance at

53:49.927 --> 53:53.831
33430 Rustic Canyon Road.

53:54.699 --> 53:55.966
No, dispatch.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.303
Contact Ben.
That's his patrol.

53:59.504 --> 54:01.606
Don't think we
haven't been trying.

54:01.639 --> 54:04.609
Ben hasn't answered
and has not called in.

54:05.843 --> 54:08.012
He's probably
sleeping one off.

54:09.314 --> 54:10.715
Again?

54:12.249 --> 54:15.520
Uh, 10-4 Dispatch.
We are on our way.

54:16.321 --> 54:17.855
Please be advised...

54:17.888 --> 54:21.792
Vic says his fiancée is
trying to bite him to death.

54:21.826 --> 54:24.028
He's locked himself
in the bathroom.

54:25.630 --> 54:27.632
Ha ha! Say it again?

54:28.566 --> 54:33.938
Vic says his fiancée is
trying to bite him to death.

54:33.971 --> 54:36.741
He's locked himself
in the bathroom.

54:36.774 --> 54:40.778
He says she's bitten off
two of his fingers and a toe.

54:42.413 --> 54:44.515
10-4 Dispatch.

54:44.549 --> 54:46.651
We'll muzzle her if needed.

54:46.684 --> 54:48.686
Over and out.

54:49.587 --> 54:52.990
That must be one angry fiancée.

54:53.858 --> 54:54.692
Now...

54:54.725 --> 54:56.561
what would you do...

54:56.594 --> 54:58.896
if your fiancée no less...

54:58.929 --> 55:00.931
bit off your toe?

55:01.298 --> 55:03.300
You know what I'd do.

55:04.369 --> 55:05.736
Exactly.

55:06.571 --> 55:07.972
Let's not hurry this.

55:08.005 --> 55:10.007
If this guy can't take
care of his woman...

55:12.343 --> 55:13.944
Exactly.

55:13.978 --> 55:16.647
I say we fire up one more.

55:16.681 --> 55:19.517
It'll give us better perspective

55:19.550 --> 55:21.886
of the overall situation

55:21.919 --> 55:23.488
when we get there.

55:23.521 --> 55:24.989
Exactly.

55:25.423 --> 55:28.559
Besides, he's locked
himself in the bathroom.

55:37.568 --> 55:38.769
In the old country...

55:39.670 --> 55:40.971
...we'd cut off
your hands and feet

55:41.005 --> 55:44.008
and leave you in
the woods with the wolves.

55:44.041 --> 55:46.977
That way you'd still be
alive when they devoured you.

55:47.011 --> 55:48.579
That's the old way.

55:49.647 --> 55:53.984
Today, we have law to
take care of pound of flesh.

55:54.018 --> 55:55.420
Most of the time.

55:55.453 --> 55:57.888
Yes. Most of the time.

55:57.922 --> 55:58.956
But...

55:58.989 --> 56:01.859
Even in this country
we know how to make you pay.

56:01.892 --> 56:03.861
You disappointed us, Michael.

56:03.894 --> 56:06.363
You invested our money
without including us.

56:06.397 --> 56:07.398
Your money?

56:07.432 --> 56:08.433
Of course.

56:08.466 --> 56:10.401
Who's money did
you think it was?

56:10.435 --> 56:12.336
You said, "keep the cash".

56:12.369 --> 56:13.337
Yes.

56:13.370 --> 56:15.139
But it is not your cash.

56:15.806 --> 56:21.646
We could not explain money,
so you were our bank, Michael.

56:21.679 --> 56:23.581
But make no mistake...

56:23.614 --> 56:24.949
It's our cash.

56:24.982 --> 56:27.518
You truly didn't think
the money was yours?

56:28.653 --> 56:30.821
Sometimes in this country
you people have more

56:30.855 --> 56:32.122
balls than brains.

56:32.156 --> 56:34.459
Which brings us
back to our problem.

56:34.492 --> 56:36.126
We want our money.

56:36.160 --> 56:38.896
There is no actual money.

56:38.929 --> 56:40.931
As you said,
the money's invested.

56:40.965 --> 56:44.001
You invested our
money without including us.

56:45.570 --> 56:47.838
You said, "keep the cash"!

56:47.872 --> 56:51.075
Don't play tough guy
with us, Michael.

56:51.108 --> 56:53.444
Maybe you think
you are tough guy

56:53.478 --> 56:55.580
and we are dumb immigrants.

56:55.613 --> 56:58.983
One week. We want our money.

56:59.016 --> 57:01.986
One week, Michael. No more.

57:02.019 --> 57:07.625
Or you will wake up and find
your big balls in your mouth.

57:22.740 --> 57:24.809
Well, welcome back Kotter.

57:24.842 --> 57:26.777
You know, I always
thought I'd see you again.

57:26.811 --> 57:27.945
You had that look.

57:27.978 --> 57:28.879
What look?

57:29.446 --> 57:31.782
The look of a killa'.
Hungry for action.

57:31.816 --> 57:33.884
Or maybe just desperate.

57:33.918 --> 57:35.920
No, not you.

57:36.887 --> 57:39.757
I live all day long with desperate people and believe me

57:39.790 --> 57:41.158
they don't look like you.

57:41.191 --> 57:43.027
I want the cannon.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.729
And I'll take a suppressor.

57:44.762 --> 57:47.197
Ha!
We call it a silencer, killa.

57:47.231 --> 57:49.233
You going balls deep, huh?

57:49.767 --> 57:52.202
Now, are you the hunter?
or the hunted?

57:52.236 --> 57:53.203
Does it matter?

57:53.237 --> 57:54.639
No, not really.

57:54.672 --> 57:56.874
But I wouldn't want
you coming after me.

57:56.907 --> 57:59.109
Especially with that monster.

57:59.143 --> 58:01.812
I don't use 'em,
I just sell 'em.

58:10.521 --> 58:12.857
What's wrong with
this picture, Michael?

59:48.152 --> 59:49.987
Fake?

59:50.020 --> 59:52.022
Who puts fake guns in a cabin?!

01:00:01.766 --> 01:00:05.269
Ahhhhh!!!

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:08.205
1 Adam 4, do you copy?

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.610
1 Adam 4, do you copy?

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:17.214
Maybe we should get moving.

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:22.252
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.288
We better get moving.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:26.957
1 Adam 4, do you copy?!

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:34.799
We copy, dispatch.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:39.036
You are not going to believe
this but we are issuing a

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:42.406
county wide emergency
alert within the hour.

01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:47.144
What gives?

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.979
Need to know basis.

01:00:49.013 --> 01:00:52.016
We'll get briefed after all
cars return to Headquarters.

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:54.985
What? We're being recalled?

01:00:55.019 --> 01:00:56.286
That's a big 10-4.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.024
You are to drop everything
and return to HQ immediately.

01:01:00.057 --> 01:01:01.058
Do you copy?

01:01:02.727 --> 01:01:04.729
10-4. Copy that.

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:08.032
Now, what is up with that?

01:01:11.035 --> 01:01:13.037
Beats the hell out of me.

01:01:14.839 --> 01:01:16.373
But the question is...

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:19.076
Do we still go
up to Rustic Canyon?

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:22.412
Well, if we gun it...

01:01:22.446 --> 01:01:24.782
I mean, if we really gun it...

01:01:24.815 --> 01:01:26.817
We're only about
ten minutes away.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:30.020
And I, for one...

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:33.057
want to see that killer fiancée.

01:01:33.991 --> 01:01:35.993
I want to see
the ball-less wonder.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.133
I say we go for it.

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:44.301
I'm with you!

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:46.336
Well then, let's do it!

01:04:30.234 --> 01:04:33.237
I'll do the heavy lifting.
You do the cleanup.

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:41.411
Thornton, you're not on the list

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.314
What about now?
Am I on the list now?

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.154
Face it, Michael.

01:05:24.188 --> 01:05:26.323
She's never coming back to you.

01:05:28.325 --> 01:05:31.028
And why didn't she
break through the windows?

01:05:37.667 --> 01:05:40.670
Because she can't
stand her own reflection.

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:44.208
So what's a guy
like you gonna do?

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:50.180
I'm gonna kill that bitch.

01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.354
Oh yeah.

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:06.330
Fiancée my ass.

01:07:18.202 --> 01:07:19.636
Michael?

01:09:51.555 --> 01:09:54.558
Out of sight, out of mind.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:58.688
Buck up, Bucko.

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:54.711
Well, well, well.
What a weekend!

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:56.846
Wild and crazy weekend!

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.582
Good news. Bad news.

01:11:58.615 --> 01:11:59.883
Please tell us.

01:11:59.916 --> 01:12:02.919
Good news is they cancelled
the county wide emergency.

01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:06.390
Bad news is they have
dozens of people still missing.

01:12:06.423 --> 01:12:10.527
People apparently just went
crack crazy this weekend!

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.596
That is bad news. And..?

01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:13.497
And what?

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.898
And what about
the Bigfoot rumor?

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:16.299
Oh! So you heard?

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.334
It's all anyone is talking about.

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:20.904
For those of you who were living
under a rock or in a cave this

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:24.474
weekend, the rumor is...
They found Bigfoot!

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:25.842
Please go on.

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.977
The rumor is not only that they
found Bigfoot but they found

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:31.047
him dead in the middle of the road with a
 tire iron sticking through his chest.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:36.753
That's exactly what I'm hearing. They say 
the body measured nine to ten feet tall!

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:40.757
But the authorities aren't talking.
They will neither confirm nor deny!

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:45.429
Obviously they will be housed with Area
51 and all the little green aliens.

01:12:45.462 --> 01:12:47.397
Ha ha! You are correct, sir!

01:12:47.431 --> 01:12:48.364
I am indeed.

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:50.400
Any other local news of interest?

01:12:50.434 --> 01:12:55.772
Local doctors were able to successfully
re-attach two fingers, a thumb, and a big toe

01:12:55.805 --> 01:12:59.409
to a man who must have thrown
himself in front of a lawn mower.

01:12:59.443 --> 01:13:02.779
You know, some guys will do
anything to get out of taking out the trash.

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:06.583
Wow! A big toe!
Amazing what science can do.

01:13:06.616 --> 01:13:08.685
Amazing, amazing, amazing it is.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:10.119
That's one lucky fellow.

01:13:10.153 --> 01:13:12.055
Yes he is, he is indeed.

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:14.891
Now to warm up our night...
here's some summer music.

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:50.126
You can imagine how
skeptical people are right now.

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:52.829
Official word to be
released is that the

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:55.599
county water supply
was contaminated.

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:58.167
With LSD.

01:13:59.503 --> 01:14:01.605
Do you think I did this to myself?

01:14:01.638 --> 01:14:03.607
Well, stranger things have
happened to people under

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:05.642
the influence of hallucinogens.

01:14:06.543 --> 01:14:08.411
But I digress --

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:11.815
The only reason we agreed to
this interview is you maintain

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:14.851
you have proof of
what you say happened...

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:16.586
I mean...

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:21.090
Even you have to admit your
story is fanciful and...

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.726
quite difficult to believe.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:24.127
Yes.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.530
I find it quite
difficult to believe.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:29.465
But you say you have proof.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.468
We need to see it, Michael.

01:14:32.502 --> 01:14:34.838
When my Fiancée...

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:36.172
She bit me.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:39.509
She bit me many many times.

01:14:39.543 --> 01:14:43.012
It was inevitable that her
blood would mix with mine.

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:47.751
I can feel the changes.

01:14:47.784 --> 01:14:52.155
That's all well and good but
we need to see actual proof!

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:54.791
Oh, I'm going
to show you proof.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:15:00.129
I'm going to show you all
the proof you will ever...

01:15:01.130 --> 01:15:03.132
...need.
