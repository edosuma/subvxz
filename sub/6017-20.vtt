00:02.436 --> 00:03.994
The thing about birthday parties...

00:05.573 --> 00:08.440
...is that the first and last party
you have are quite similar.

00:08.609 --> 00:10.167
You just kind of sit there.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.245
You're the least excited person
at the party.

00:13.414 --> 00:16.110
You don't even realize
that there is a party.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.841
You don't know what's going on.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.619
Both birthday parties,
people have to help you...

00:20.788 --> 00:23.780
...blow out the candles. You don't
even know why you're doing it.

00:23.958 --> 00:26.358
What is this ritual?
What is going on?

00:26.927 --> 00:30.363
It's also the only two birthday parties
where other people have to gather...

00:30.531 --> 00:32.897
...your friends together for you.

00:33.434 --> 00:36.062
Sometimes they're not your friends.
They make the judgment.

00:36.236 --> 00:40.639
They bring them in, and they tell you,
"These are your friends.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.943
Tell them, 'Thank you for coming
to my birthday party.'"

00:47.581 --> 00:50.106
These are great. Just great.

00:50.284 --> 00:54.380
Really great. Really, really great.
Don't you think so, Elaine?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.050
Yeah. Really great.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.325
A coffee table book
about coffee tables.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.758
How did you come up
with this idea?

01:02.997 --> 01:04.555
It was there.

01:04.965 --> 01:07.593
Look at this one. It's saying,
"I'm a coffee table.

01:07.768 --> 01:11.204
Put some coffee on me. The hotter
the better. That's what I'm here for."

01:11.605 --> 01:14.540
You know, actually,
I've got some work I've got to do.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.675
How about if the book came
with these little foldout legs...

01:17.845 --> 01:20.643
...so the book itself
becomes a coffee table?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.475
That is a great idea.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.208
Really, really great.

01:26.854 --> 01:31.086
And that coffee table is saying,
"Put some coffee on me."

01:31.492 --> 01:34.484
I'd like to put some coffee on her.
Hot, scalding coffee...

01:34.662 --> 01:37.961
...right in her face. I swear, this is
like working with a contestant...

01:38.132 --> 01:40.532
...from <i>The Price Is Right</i>.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.369
Yeah, that's real interesting.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.972
Listen, tell me
if you think this is funny.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.509
"Men definitely hit the remote
more than women.

01:50.678 --> 01:55.672
Men don't care what's on TV.
Men only care what else is on TV.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.818
Women wanna see what the show is
before they change the channel...

01:58.986 --> 02:00.681
...because men hunt
and women nest."

02:00.854 --> 02:02.583
Yeah, it's funny. I don't know.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.925
You don't know?
Come on, that's gold.

02:06.093 --> 02:10.120
-Well, I don't know about gold.
-Oh, that's gold, baby.

02:10.864 --> 02:15.096
-"Baby"? Are you doing George now?
-I was saying "baby" before George.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.367
Don't ask me
any more questions...

02:17.538 --> 02:19.870
...about jokes.
It puts pressure on me.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.769
Leonard Christian's gonna be there.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.170
Yeah? Who's he?

02:23.343 --> 02:26.801
A writer from <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>.
I would like to have a good show.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.449
<i>-Danke sch√∂n</i>, my little dumplings.
-Hi.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.881
-Hey, how about that Toby?
-Yeah, how about her?

02:33.320 --> 02:36.414
She's a package full of energy.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.893
-She's a package full of something.
-And that something is life.

02:40.194 --> 02:43.254
You got to meet her.
She's brimming with positivity.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.399
-Oh, please.
-Hey.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.398
-Are you performing tomorrow?
-Yeah.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.900
Great. I'm gonna bring Toby.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.731
You better laugh.
I'm being reviewed.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.567
-Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
-She's a great laugher.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.472
Yeah. She's a great laugher, Jerry.

02:57.644 --> 03:00.442
"Really, really great."

03:00.948 --> 03:03.178
Want to sit with George?
He's coming with Robin.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.784
-Is that the waitress from the club?
-Yeah.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.922
-Is she bringing her kid too?
-She's got a kid?

03:09.089 --> 03:11.819
You should see George
get along with this kid.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.554
What are you doing under there?
Stop that.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.424
Don't eat that. That's not food.

03:17.598 --> 03:21.364
-He's sucking down Equal packets.
-Do you think 25 kids is too much?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.197
Twenty-five kids
for his birthday party?

03:24.438 --> 03:28.431
Don't put your tongue on the floor.
He's putting his tongue on the floor.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.544
Here, here.
Have some more sugar packets.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.372
So, what about entertainment?

03:33.580 --> 03:35.946
-Should I get Barney?
-No Barney.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.678
-Maybe a clown.
-How about Bozo?

03:38.852 --> 03:40.649
Who's Bozo?

03:40.888 --> 03:44.221
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown.
That's who Bozo is.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.292
When I was a kid, Bozo the Clown
was the clown, bar none.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.291
-George.
-With the orange hair...

03:49.463 --> 03:51.954
...the big clown shirt with the ruffles.
-George.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.828
-A TV show, he had cartoons.
-George!

03:55.002 --> 03:57.800
Forget Bozo, George.
Bozo's out.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.906
He's finished. It's over for Bozo.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.105
When I was a kid,
we didn't have these parties...

04:04.278 --> 04:06.542
...with catered food
and entertainment.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.577
I remember
my seventh birthday party.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.683
Blow out the candles!
Blow out the candles!

04:10.851 --> 04:12.682
I said blow out the damn candles!

04:12.853 --> 04:16.914
-Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
-Blow out the candles!

04:18.458 --> 04:21.552
Well, this time,
you can blow out the candles.

04:21.795 --> 04:25.162
No, I have asthma. Ben. Ben!

04:28.402 --> 04:30.063
Hi.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.836
-Hi, Toby.
-How are you doing today?

04:33.540 --> 04:35.405
Fine.

04:39.479 --> 04:42.448
-How are you?
-Oh, I'm great. Just great.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.844
Really great.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.613
-Hey, did you hear about Bob Rosen?
-No.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.690
He's going to Knopf.
He's going to be a vice president.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.121
Knopf? Really?

04:53.627 --> 04:56.653
Boy, that means there's
an opening here for...

04:56.897 --> 05:00.230
...senior editor.
Has Lippman hired anyone?

05:00.400 --> 05:03.130
No. I hear he wants
to promote someone in-house.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.971
-Really?
-Maybe it'll be you.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.366
-Well...
-You really deserve it.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.246
-Well...
-I mean, you have experience...

05:13.413 --> 05:16.382
...seniority, Lippman really respects
your opinion.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.008
Well...

05:21.154 --> 05:23.088
-Hey, it could be you.
-No.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.149
-No, really.
-Really? You think so?

05:26.526 --> 05:29.723
-Sure.
-Boy, wouldn't that be exciting?

05:30.364 --> 05:35.427
-Stranger things have happened.
-Me, a senior editor. I'd like that.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.570
You shouldn't get your hopes up.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.800
Well, it's a possibility.
Like you said...

05:41.008 --> 05:45.240
...stranger things have happened.
Thank you, Elaine. Thank you.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.476
-Hey, Ronnie.
-Hey.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.416
Can I have a club soda?

05:54.588 --> 05:55.816
-Going on tonight?
-Yeah.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.217
-You?
-Yeah.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.450
-You know, Leonard Christian's here.
-I know.

05:59.626 --> 06:03.460
Can I ask you something?
Are my nostrils getting bigger?

06:05.198 --> 06:07.666
-I don't think so.
-Are you sure?

06:07.834 --> 06:09.665
Take a look.
Do they seem a little bigger?

06:09.836 --> 06:11.303
I don't know. I don't know.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.803
Is it possible for nostrils to expand?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.509
-Is this a bit?
-Hey, I don't do bits.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.668
I'm a prop comic.

06:18.845 --> 06:22.508
Damn it. I can't find my water gun.
I can't go on without my water gun.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.449
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.145
-Well, here's Toby. Jerry.
-This is so exciting.

06:28.355 --> 06:31.017
Look. I have goose bumps. Touch.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.624
Touch them.

06:34.261 --> 06:36.058
-Hey.
-I've never been...

06:36.229 --> 06:38.823
...to a comedy club before.
-Really?

06:38.999 --> 06:41.729
Many restaurants are serving
brewed decaf now too.

06:43.470 --> 06:46.962
-You are so funny.
-You'll have a good time, I swear.

06:47.541 --> 06:51.272
He swears, like he thinks
I don't believe him. I believe you.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.345
-He's so funny.
-What about me?

06:53.513 --> 06:55.037
What about you?

06:56.116 --> 06:58.516
I'm only kidding. You're funny too.

06:58.685 --> 06:59.913
I love to laugh.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.987
-Good.
-So you up next?

07:02.155 --> 07:04.089
Yeah. Why don't you guys
get a good table.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.418
We don't want some jerk
sitting in front of us.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.686
It'll be like, "Hey, big-head,
can you move?

07:08.862 --> 07:11.831
I didn't pay a cover charge
to stare at your bald spot."

07:13.233 --> 07:14.894
-So you have a good show.
-Yeah.

07:15.068 --> 07:18.333
Have a great show. Hey, we'll
make sure it's a great show.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.666
-Okay. Good. I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

07:21.375 --> 07:25.869
He's so great. This is so great.
I'm so excited.

07:27.347 --> 07:30.043
Men definitely hit the remote button
more than women.

07:30.217 --> 07:34.176
-Really, really. That is so true.
-Yes, I... Yeah.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.686
Men don't care what's on TV.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.189
Men only care what else is on TV.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.451
Yes. Right on, right on.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.192
See, women...

07:45.365 --> 07:48.926
Women wanna see what the show is
before they change the channel.

07:49.169 --> 07:52.070
That is so true. Yes, yes.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.264
That's why men hunt
and women nest.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.740
Yeah, anyway... Yeah, all right.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.943
So anyway...
What was I talking about?

08:11.558 --> 08:13.719
-Hey.
-Hey. What's the deal?

08:13.894 --> 08:16.761
I invite you down here,
I have an important show...

08:16.930 --> 08:19.421
...and she heckles me?
-She didn't mean anything.

08:19.633 --> 08:23.535
-What's the matter? Is she crazy?
-She's just enthusiastic, that's all.

08:23.703 --> 08:26.501
-Hey, what is wrong with you?
-Me?

08:26.807 --> 08:29.469
-Nothing's wrong with me.
-You boo me?

08:29.643 --> 08:33.169
You hiss? You didn't stop blathering
throughout the whole set.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.474
Come on. I thought you're a pro.
That's part of the show.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.982
No. Not part of the show.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.347
Booing and hissing
are not part of the show.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.979
You boo puppets.
You hiss villains in silent movies.

08:45.425 --> 08:47.359
That's the way I express myself.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.620
How will you make it
if you can't take it?

08:50.163 --> 08:52.825
-I can take it.
-Let's go.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.732
Hey, man, good set.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.676
-Bozo?
-No.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.209
-B-O-Z-O.
-Sorry. I...

09:08.515 --> 09:10.346
You've never heard
of Bozo the Clown?

09:10.517 --> 09:11.882
No.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.488
-How could you not know?
-I don't know. I just don't.

09:15.789 --> 09:19.156
How can you call yourself a clown
and not know who Bozo is?

09:19.326 --> 09:24.161
Hey, what are you hassling me for?
This is just a gig. It's not my life.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.193
I don't know who Bozo is.
Is he a clown?

09:26.366 --> 09:28.061
What, are you kidding me?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.203
-Well, what is he?
-Yes, he's a clown.

09:30.370 --> 09:33.635
All right. So, what's the big deal?
There's millions of clowns.

09:34.641 --> 09:37.542
-All right, just forget it.
-Forget..? Me? You should forget it.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.942
You're living in the past, man.
You're hung up on some clown...

09:41.114 --> 09:43.742
...from the '60s, man.
-All right.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.485
Very good, very good. All right,
go fold your balloon animals, Eric.

09:47.687 --> 09:51.020
Eric. What kind of name
is that for a clown, huh?

09:51.191 --> 09:54.786
Excuse me. You must be George.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.487
I'm Robin's mother.
You seem like...

09:58.665 --> 10:03.466
...such a lovely young man.
-Well, I do what I can.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.229
Hi, Ma. How's everything?

10:05.405 --> 10:09.603
This is just a wonderful party.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.639
The burgers should be ready
in a minute.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.540
Great, great.

10:15.215 --> 10:16.944
What's that smell?

10:17.584 --> 10:19.313
Smoke?

10:19.653 --> 10:21.143
Smoke.

10:21.321 --> 10:25.052
Everybody, I think I smell
some smoke back here.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.752
Fire! Get out of here!

10:27.928 --> 10:29.793
Get out of my way!

10:33.667 --> 10:36.693
-It was an inferno in there!
-There he is. That's him!

10:37.304 --> 10:41.365
-That's the coward that left us to die.
-Let go.

10:50.584 --> 10:53.644
I was trying to lead the way.

10:53.820 --> 10:58.086
We needed a leader,
someone to lead the way to safety.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.387
But you yelled, "Get out of my way."

11:02.262 --> 11:03.695
Because...

11:03.863 --> 11:05.296
Because...

11:05.565 --> 11:08.193
...as the leader, if I die...

11:08.435 --> 11:11.495
...then all hope is lost.

11:11.738 --> 11:14.229
Who would lead? The clown?

11:15.775 --> 11:18.437
Instead of castigating me,
you should be thanking me.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.977
What kind of topsy-turvy world
do we live in where heroes...

11:22.148 --> 11:25.413
...are cast as villains,
brave men as cowards?

11:25.585 --> 11:27.985
But I saw you push the women
and children...

11:28.154 --> 11:30.213
...out of the way in a mad panic.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.085
I saw you knock them down.

11:33.260 --> 11:36.718
And when you ran out,
you left everyone behind.

11:36.896 --> 11:40.559
Seemingly. Seemingly.
To the untrained eye...

11:40.734 --> 11:43.430
...I can fully understand
how you got that impression.

11:44.638 --> 11:48.836
What looked like pushing,
what looked like knocking down...

11:49.009 --> 11:51.807
...was a safety precaution.
In a fire...

11:51.978 --> 11:55.277
...you stay close to the ground.
Am I right? Well...

11:55.448 --> 12:00.249
And when I ran out that door,
I was not leaving anyone behind.

12:00.453 --> 12:04.116
Quite the contrary.
I risked my life...

12:04.291 --> 12:07.226
...making sure that exit was clear.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.823
Any other questions?

12:11.531 --> 12:13.362
How do you live with yourself?

12:13.700 --> 12:15.167
It's not easy.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.839
So she doesn't want
to see me anymore.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.543
Did you knock her over too
or just the kids?

12:29.983 --> 12:31.848
No, her too.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.747
And her mother.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.082
-Really? Her mother?
-Yeah.

12:37.824 --> 12:40.452
I may have stepped
on her arm too.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.995
You probably couldn't see
because of the smoke.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.392
Yeah.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.499
But it was somebody's arm.

12:48.335 --> 12:51.702
So you feel "women and children first"
in this day and age...

12:51.871 --> 12:54.032
...is somewhat
of an antiquated notion.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.336
To some degree, yeah.

12:56.509 --> 13:01.037
So basically, it's every man, woman,
child and invalid for themselves.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.506
-In a manner of speaking.
-Yeah.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.341
-Well, it's honest.
-Yeah.

13:06.519 --> 13:10.182
She should be commending me
for treating everyone like equals.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.816
Perhaps when she's released
from the burn center...

13:13.993 --> 13:15.893
...she'll see things differently.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.060
Perhaps.

13:21.167 --> 13:23.601
So, what was the fire,
just some greasy hamburgers?

13:23.770 --> 13:28.400
Yeah. Eric the clown
put it out with his big shoe.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.904
-By the way, did you see this?
-What's that?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.952
The Leonard Christian
article about my show.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.056
Plus my gig in Miami got canceled.
I bet you it's because of the article.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.857
He really does a number on you.
"Seinfeld froze like a deer...

13:48.027 --> 13:51.554
...in the headlights in the face
of incessant heckling."

13:51.798 --> 13:54.631
I should've let her have it.
I held back because of Kramer.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.333
Know what you should do?

13:56.503 --> 13:59.165
-Go to her office and heckle her.
-Right.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.070
All the comedians say, "What if I came
to your work and heckled you?"

14:03.243 --> 14:06.440
-Yeah, that'd be something.
-I'm not kidding. You should do it.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.508
Wouldn't that be the ultimate
comedian's revenge?

14:09.682 --> 14:13.174
-I've always had a fantasy about that.
-Well, go ahead. Do it.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.484
-Why can't I?
-No reason.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.753
You know what?
I think I'm gonna do that.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.826
She came down to where I work.
I'll go down to where she works.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.890
-This is unprecedented.
-There's no precedent, baby.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.569
What, you're using
my "babies" now?

14:34.808 --> 14:37.936
Hey, nice shoes.
Do you wear sandals to work?

14:38.111 --> 14:41.012
It's nice to walk into a room
and get the aroma of feet.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.081
Real conducive
to the work atmosphere.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.716
I'm sure your coworkers like it.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.045
"Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office."

14:47.220 --> 14:50.280
"Great idea.
We can check on her bunions."

14:50.557 --> 14:53.651
You know, I have work to do here.
I'm very busy.

14:53.827 --> 14:58.491
Is this disruptive? You find it hard
to work with someone interrupting?

14:58.765 --> 15:02.201
-How'd you like it if I called security?
-Security?

15:02.368 --> 15:06.099
I don't know how you'll make it
in this business if you can't take it.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.637
You got to be tough.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.409
You know... All right. That's it.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.047
-Get out of my way.
-What's going on?

15:15.215 --> 15:16.944
What's happening here? Toby.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.877
Toby!

15:19.519 --> 15:22.579
-My pinkie toe.
-Toby!

15:26.860 --> 15:29.124
What did you go out there
to heckle her for?

15:29.329 --> 15:31.320
Because she came down the club
and heckled me.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.193
I gave her a taste
of her own medicine.

15:33.366 --> 15:37.234
Oh, yeah! You gave her a taste
of medicine, all right.

15:37.403 --> 15:40.930
-I didn't want her to have an accident.
-What accident?

15:41.107 --> 15:44.304
After he heckled Toby,
she ran out of the building...

15:44.477 --> 15:46.707
...and a street sweeper
ran over her foot...

15:46.880 --> 15:48.780
...and severed her pinkie toe.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.045
-That's unbelievable.
-Yeah. Then after the ambulance left...

15:52.218 --> 15:54.152
...I found the toe.

15:54.354 --> 15:58.415
I put it in a Cracker Jack box with ice
and took off for the hospital.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.219
-You ran?
-No. I jumped on the bus.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.919
I told the driver,
"I got a toe here, buddy. Step on it."

16:05.331 --> 16:07.265
-Holy cow!
-Yeah, yeah.

16:07.500 --> 16:11.197
Then all of a sudden,
this guy pulls out a gun.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.101
Well, I knew any delay's
gonna cost her her pinkie toe...

16:14.274 --> 16:17.266
...so I got up, and I started walking
towards him.

16:17.577 --> 16:20.273
He says, "Where do you think
you're going, Cracker Jack?"

16:20.446 --> 16:23.210
I says, "Well, I got a prize
for you, buddy."

16:26.286 --> 16:28.720
-Knocked him out cold.
-How could you do that?

16:28.888 --> 16:31.948
Then everybody is screaming
because the driver's passed out...

16:32.125 --> 16:35.720
...because of all the commotion.
The bus is out of control.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.690
So I grab him by the collar,
take him out of the seat...

16:39.866 --> 16:42.630
...get behind the wheel.
Now I'm driving the bus.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.097
-You're Batman.
-Yeah. I am Batman.

16:47.273 --> 16:50.265
Then the mugger, he comes to,
and he starts choking me.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.308
So I'm fighting him off
with one hand...

16:52.478 --> 16:55.208
...and I kept driving the bus
with the other, you know?

16:55.381 --> 16:58.214
Then I managed to open the door
and kicked him out the door...

16:58.384 --> 17:00.511
...with my foot, you know,
at the next stop.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.578
You kept making all the stops?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.592
Well, people kept ringing the bell!

17:15.001 --> 17:17.265
Well, what about the toe?
What happened to the toe?

17:17.436 --> 17:19.132
Well, I am happy to say...

17:19.305 --> 17:22.900
...the little guy's back in place
at the end of the line.

17:24.676 --> 17:28.306
You did all this for a pinkie toe?

17:28.982 --> 17:31.314
Well, it's a valuable appendage.

17:34.153 --> 17:38.556
So Kramer found the toe,
and they reattached it.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.226
-Really?
-Yeah. Poor kid.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.362
-What an ordeal.
-And you know...

17:43.529 --> 17:46.965
...how extremely sensitive she is.
She's gonna need our full support.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.431
-Yeah, right.
-Look who's here.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.569
-Toby.
-Hey, it's Toby.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.571
Hi. How are you?
How are you feeling?

17:55.008 --> 17:57.169
-I'll be okay.
-Are you sure?

17:57.343 --> 17:59.777
-I think so.
-Toby, what can I do?

17:59.946 --> 18:02.972
-Can I get you something?
-No, thank you.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.413
Toby, please let us help.
We're family.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.076
Well, I could use a cup of coffee.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.790
-She got the promotion?
-Yep.

18:11.991 --> 18:14.084
-Why?
-I'll tell you why.

18:14.260 --> 18:17.195
Because of her pinkie toe,
that's why.

18:17.430 --> 18:21.423
Because Lippman felt so sorry for her,
he didn't want to hurt her feelings.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.399
-Too bad.
-Sure, the pinkie toe is cute...

18:24.570 --> 18:27.266
...but I mean, what is it? It's useless.

18:27.440 --> 18:32.036
It does nothing. It's got that little nail
that is just impossible to cut.

18:32.211 --> 18:33.906
-Why do we need it?
-That's the one...

18:34.080 --> 18:36.071
...that goes "wee, wee, wee"
all the way home.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.841
-You just shut the...
-Elaine, did you hear the news?

18:40.019 --> 18:42.613
-Toby got promoted.
-Yes, I heard, Kramer.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.986
-I work there, remember?
-You know what she told me?

18:46.159 --> 18:49.128
Her first order of business
is to put my coffee table book...

18:49.295 --> 18:51.695
...into the bookstores
as soon as possible.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.424
-Oh, wonderful.
-Throughout this whole thing...

18:54.600 --> 18:58.764
...she always kept smiling.
-Of course. She's deranged.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.672
I went down to the magazine,
pleaded with him to see me again.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.540
He agreed to come down tonight
and write another article.

19:07.914 --> 19:10.109
I heard you went down
to somebody's office...

19:10.283 --> 19:12.217
...and heckled them.
-Damn right.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.979
-We've been lap dogs long enough.
-How could you do that?

19:15.154 --> 19:16.746
Everybody's talking about it.

19:16.923 --> 19:19.448
It's about time one of us
drew a line in the sand.

19:19.692 --> 19:23.093
Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.994
You opened the door for all of us.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.326
I can't wait
until somebody heckles me.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.731
-Well, it won't be long.
-Ladies and gentlemen...

19:30.903 --> 19:33.599
...please welcome Jerry Seinfeld.
-Got to go.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.066
Robin? Robin.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.874
-George, what is it? I'm working.
-Robin, listen to me.

19:42.048 --> 19:44.141
The most amazing thing
has happened.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.979
Kramer has opened my eyes.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.517
I think I've changed.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.418
-What are you talking about?
-Okay.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.491
I mean, Bozo the Clown.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.424
I mean, does he really need
"the Clown" in his title?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.690
As clown. Bozo the Clown.

20:00.133 --> 20:03.227
Are we gonna confuse him with Bozo
the district attorney?

20:03.436 --> 20:06.496
Bozo the pope?
There's no other Bozo.

20:06.839 --> 20:11.776
You'll see. Things will be different now
if you'll just give me one more chance.

20:12.078 --> 20:15.104
Listen, I got to think about this.

20:15.281 --> 20:19.775
-All right, but I'm serious about this.
-All right. Hand it over, man.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.589
That's why men hunt
and women nest.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.190
He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

20:26.359 --> 20:27.621
Get out of the way!

20:35.802 --> 20:37.599
-George.
-What?

20:37.970 --> 20:41.804
-This is Ronnie Kaye.
-The prop comic?

20:44.010 --> 20:45.307
Hi. I didn't...

20:45.478 --> 20:48.743
I didn't recognize you.
What, did you..? You get a haircut?

20:48.915 --> 20:51.008
Nostrils.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.546
George?

20:53.986 --> 20:55.920
Could I have a word?

21:04.997 --> 21:08.524
I was in a hotel, and the back of a door
in the hotel, they have that fire map.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.465
I'm flattered they think
I'll stand in a burning hotel room...

21:11.637 --> 21:13.127
...memorizing directions.

21:13.372 --> 21:17.240
I'll go left by the stair,
right by the candy machine.

21:17.577 --> 21:21.775
I'd probably get lost, have to go back
to the room, check the map again.

21:22.915 --> 21:27.477
They always tell you, whatever you do
in a hotel fire, do not panic.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.679
Hey, I've got four minutes to live.
I've never panicked in my life.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.518
It's my option.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.383
Even if they find you,
you have a perfect excuse.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.990
They saved you
swinging from the shower curtain...

21:38.164 --> 21:41.065
...naked with the ice bucket
on your head. What happened?

21:41.400 --> 21:44.028
Well, I panicked.
That's understandable.
