WEBVTT

00:00.783 --> 00:02.487
–Sally? –Brad.
–Sally.

00:02.487 --> 00:03.552
How you doing, old man?

00:03.552 --> 00:06.337
Joanna, I have a matter
of great urgency.

00:06.337 --> 00:08.467
How about we measure you
for some trousers?

00:08.467 --> 00:09.952
Getting measured for pants…

00:09.952 --> 00:11.090
That some kind of fetish?

00:11.090 --> 00:13.343
Judge Marcia Hooper
was found murdered last night.

00:13.343 --> 00:14.230
We were having an affair.

00:14.230 --> 00:16.055
–What's going on?
–The police just arrested Scott Little.

00:16.055 --> 00:17.981
–Who were the other suspects?
–He was the only viable one.

00:17.981 --> 00:20.411
He was the only one
you considered at all.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.603
<i>–Maybe I should do it.
–You mean kill judge Hooper?</i>

00:22.603 --> 00:25.324
You gave the tape to the police
the afternoon of her death?

00:25.324 --> 00:26.712
Well, I gave it to her husband.

00:26.712 --> 00:28.290
I gotta ask you this question, judge.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.503
Did you kill your wife?

00:29.503 --> 00:31.523
He made her get that
restraining order against me.

00:31.523 --> 00:33.003
Well, you are a peeping Tom.

00:33.003 --> 00:34.050
Clearly she made you angry.

00:34.050 --> 00:36.544
–She was drawn to me!
–You kill her, Lincoln?

00:36.544 --> 00:39.093
Scott Little's father is on
the prosecution's witness list.

00:39.093 --> 00:43.982
He was gratifying himself,
and I noticed on the bed…

00:43.982 --> 00:45.769
a picture.
–A picture of?

00:45.769 --> 00:47.652
A naked woman.
It was his mother.

00:47.652 --> 00:50.103
Scott was sexually attracted to his mother.

00:50.103 --> 00:52.329
And when I saw the picture of the victim,

00:52.329 --> 00:53.904
how much she looked like Barbara,

00:53.904 --> 00:57.428
I realized that Scott was probably
carrying on the love affair

00:57.428 --> 01:00.266
he'd always wanted to have
with his mother.

01:29.821 --> 01:33.088
I'm not in love with you.

01:33.088 --> 01:37.952
How did you get a naked
picture of me, Scott?

01:37.952 --> 01:40.007
You were sunbathing once by the pool.

01:40.007 --> 01:42.129
You didn't know I was home.

01:42.129 --> 01:45.068
And I photographed you.

01:51.783 --> 01:53.379
–What happens now?
–What happens now?

01:53.379 --> 01:55.065
You fill out your change-of-address forms!

01:55.065 --> 01:56.175
I didn't kill her!

01:56.175 --> 01:57.761
Oh, gee, there's some rage.

01:57.761 --> 01:59.248
You shut up!

02:09.197 --> 02:11.009
<i>I am not making this up, folks.</i>

02:11.009 --> 02:16.084
<i>The father in open court accuses the son
of being in love with the mother.</i>

02:16.084 --> 02:18.635
<i>It actually made me
all tingly down there.</i>

02:18.635 --> 02:22.701
<i>This sicko is dead to right.
My face is still warm.</i>

02:22.701 --> 02:26.080
<i>I'm telling you, it was
better than sex. I mean…</i>

02:26.080 --> 02:28.304
Did she say it was better than sex?

02:28.304 --> 02:29.927
Hope she didn't mean my sex.

02:29.927 --> 02:31.884
I knew she was faking it.

02:31.884 --> 02:32.915
Denny, did you…

02:32.915 --> 02:35.767
Paul asked me to
repair relations with her.

02:35.767 --> 02:36.873
So you had them?

02:36.873 --> 02:39.224
Cheap, chubby sex in a witness room.

02:39.224 --> 02:41.513
–Oh, my!
–Obviously I didn't satisfy her.

02:41.513 --> 02:45.358
Denny, have you lost your mind?

02:47.888 --> 02:49.397
What?

02:49.397 --> 02:50.919
Nothing.

02:50.919 --> 02:54.875
Denny, we're flamingoes.

02:55.089 --> 02:58.101
Is something going on?

02:59.704 --> 03:00.886
Mad cow.

03:00.886 --> 03:02.944
It hasn't progressed in my brain,

03:02.944 --> 03:08.225
but there are other symptoms,
be it blood pressure…

03:08.225 --> 03:12.189
it affects me.
–Affects you how?

03:18.449 --> 03:21.023
I think I have mad penis.

QA: ΤΖΩΤΖΙΟΥ

03:51.017 --> 03:53.393
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2006/10/24

04:17.738 --> 04:20.005
I needed that.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.289
My God, your hair turned red.

04:23.289 --> 04:25.678
Cute.

04:28.834 --> 04:29.969
Where are you going?

04:29.969 --> 04:34.853
I would so love to spend the night,
but I have to be in court super early.

04:34.916 --> 04:38.393
–You're leaving?
–If you knew how much work I had…

04:39.154 --> 04:40.602
Okay.

04:40.602 --> 04:45.139
Can't you just lie here
and talk for a little bit?

04:45.403 --> 04:48.081
Talk about what?

04:57.127 --> 04:59.754
That was quite the bombshell
you dropped yesterday.

04:59.754 --> 05:01.770
You hate your ex-wife, don't you?

05:01.770 --> 05:03.127
Is “hate” too soft a word?

05:03.127 --> 05:05.700
–Objection!
–I bet you'd do anything to get her.

05:05.700 --> 05:06.662
Except lie.

05:06.662 --> 05:09.834
And since nothing's more important
to Barbara Little than her son Scott—

05:09.834 --> 05:11.700
He's also my son.

05:11.700 --> 05:13.162
To get him convicted of murder…

05:13.162 --> 05:14.801
Why would I punish Scott
for something that his mother…

05:14.801 --> 05:17.785
Because he came along,
she stopped loving you.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.222
She abandoned you.

05:19.222 --> 05:21.793
That made you angry at her
and angry at him,

05:21.793 --> 05:25.070
and this whole trial is your
opportunity to get even at both.

05:25.070 --> 05:27.482
–Objection!
–That's ridiculous. I love my son.

05:27.482 --> 05:29.224
–So you want him in prison?
–No, in a hospital.

05:29.224 --> 05:30.809
–With bars.
–Because he's sick.

05:30.809 --> 05:34.013
–In your mind or… –He has sexual
feelings for his own mother.

05:34.013 --> 05:35.978
For God's sake, he's sick!

05:35.978 --> 05:38.080
Mr Schiller.

05:38.552 --> 05:41.257
–You blame your ex-wife for that.
–Damn right I do.

05:41.257 --> 05:42.735
She had to know!

05:42.735 --> 05:45.843
You can't tell me this obsession grew
right under her nose without her seeing it,

05:45.843 --> 05:47.792
and she did nothing to get him treatment.

05:47.792 --> 05:48.863
She let it happen!

05:48.863 --> 05:52.178
So if you could get your son treatment,
and avenge her at the same time…

05:52.178 --> 05:55.182
This isn't about vengeance,
you disgusting cockroach!

05:55.182 --> 05:56.026
Mr Schiller!

05:56.026 --> 05:59.800
That's what you get, Mr Dirty mouth,
Mr Lawyer man dirty pants!

05:59.800 --> 06:04.091
Mr Meyer, sit down,
or I will have you removed.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.799
How dare you come here?

06:25.799 --> 06:27.630
I just came to apologize.

06:27.630 --> 06:29.219
You did no such thing.

06:29.219 --> 06:31.367
You're here to enlist my good will,

06:31.367 --> 06:35.393
try to mitigate the damage
I'll do to you in that courtroom.

06:36.850 --> 06:39.515
Would you believe me
if I said I was sorry?

06:39.515 --> 06:42.611
–No. –Would you believe me if I said
I can't stop thinking about you,

06:42.611 --> 06:44.301
and I came here to rip
all your clothes off

06:44.301 --> 06:47.468
and make wild love to you
on your desk?

06:48.476 --> 06:49.344
No.

06:49.344 --> 06:51.043
–Zach…
–And don't call me that.

06:51.043 --> 06:54.412
You and I are no longer
on familiar terms.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.398
You are a doctor.

06:57.398 --> 07:00.590
You cannot betray a patient
simply to be punitive against me.

07:00.590 --> 07:03.878
You are much better than that.

07:04.683 --> 07:08.315
You overestimate me.

07:09.204 --> 07:12.279
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

07:12.279 --> 07:13.704
Can you believe this?

07:13.704 --> 07:16.571
They're selling them
outside the courthouse.

07:16.571 --> 07:20.681
Ah, don't expect me to swallow that.

07:20.681 --> 07:24.120
You ask me, I don't think
this Jeffrey Coho is all that hot.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.484
Brad, you're threatened by him.

07:26.484 --> 07:28.113
No, I'm not threatened.

07:28.113 --> 07:30.200
It's just that everybody makes
him out to be this superstar,

07:30.200 --> 07:32.726
and so far, I'm not seeing it.

07:35.219 --> 07:38.698
Why do we even bother
to give them trials, folks?

07:55.626 --> 07:56.990
Your heart's good, right?

07:56.990 --> 07:59.406
You get yearly physicals?

08:01.291 --> 08:02.827
You think you'd kill me?

08:02.827 --> 08:05.555
It wouldn't look good on my résumé.

08:08.151 --> 08:09.627
Where are you going now?

08:09.627 --> 08:13.564
I'm in trial, Alan.
I need to get back to the office.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.505
Can't you just stay a little?

08:15.505 --> 08:17.230
I'd love to.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.358
But no.

08:30.630 --> 08:31.620
Wait a second.

08:31.620 --> 08:34.470
You want her to talk to you after?

08:34.470 --> 08:35.765
Yes.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.466
But that would make you the girl.

08:37.466 --> 08:39.828
I don't even like
to talk to them before.

08:39.828 --> 08:40.909
Exactly.

08:40.909 --> 08:43.244
What's that supposed to mean?

08:43.575 --> 08:46.782
Forget it.
Let's drink.

08:46.782 --> 08:48.777
Drink and be numb.

08:48.777 --> 08:51.396
Alan, after sex,

08:51.396 --> 08:54.651
don't we want them to leave?

08:54.651 --> 08:57.963
I guess I'm just used to being
the one who gets up first.

08:57.963 --> 09:01.551
You know, it takes 20 minutes
for a woman's <i>genital mucosa</i>

09:01.551 --> 09:03.115
to return to normal after climax.

09:03.115 --> 09:06.647
Sally doesn't even
hang around that long.

09:06.647 --> 09:11.977
I think there's some humiliation
on her part, being with me.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.992
It doesn't feel good.

09:17.547 --> 09:21.242
<i>Sometimes when you get a dream
like that over and over,</i>

09:21.242 --> 09:23.887
<i>you wonder if it's some kind
of message, you know?</i>

09:23.887 --> 09:26.750
<i>A message from who?</i>

09:26.750 --> 09:28.730
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:29.144 --> 09:30.992
<i>Maybe God.</i>

09:30.992 --> 09:32.720
<i>God?</i>

09:32.720 --> 09:34.251
<i>Telling you what?</i>

09:34.251 --> 09:36.071
<i>I don't know.</i>

09:37.223 --> 09:41.205
<i>Maybe I should do it.
That maybe I should do it.</i>

09:41.205 --> 09:43.312
<i>Do it?</i>

09:43.827 --> 09:46.773
<i>You mean kill judge Hooper?</i>

09:47.931 --> 09:50.521
You felt the need
to reveal this session.

09:50.521 --> 09:51.384
I did.

09:51.384 --> 09:54.768
I became concerned that
Mrs Hooper's life might be in danger,

09:54.768 --> 09:57.719
so I took the extraordinary measure
of turning over the tape.

09:57.719 --> 10:00.471
That's a particularly outrageous
thing for a therapist to do.

10:00.471 --> 10:03.233
Well, the tape was made
with the patient's consent

10:03.233 --> 10:04.766
and for my own use, of course.

10:04.766 --> 10:08.020
I felt I had to make it public,
because I feared for Mrs Hooper's life,

10:08.020 --> 10:10.950
a fear that unfortunately
turned out to be justified.

10:10.950 --> 10:11.926
Now on the tape,

10:11.926 --> 10:15.643
he talked about how his loving
Mrs Hooper might go against God.

10:15.643 --> 10:18.272
Yes, it goes to the heart
of his infirmity,

10:18.272 --> 10:20.030
which I believe borders on psychosis.

10:20.030 --> 10:22.253
Objection!
That goes to confidential patient…

10:22.253 --> 10:24.004
Overruled.
We have covered this.

10:24.004 --> 10:26.092
Actually, your honor, what we
covered was the admission…

10:26.092 --> 10:28.970
Mr Coho, you may
cross-examine the doctor.

10:28.970 --> 10:31.021
You may bring a motion
against him in civil court

10:31.021 --> 10:32.952
if you feel he breached
a duty to your client.

10:32.952 --> 10:35.893
But for this proceeding,
his testimony is allowed.

10:35.893 --> 10:37.479
I ask you, sir, to take your seat.

10:37.479 --> 10:39.112
Attaboy, judgie boy!

10:39.112 --> 10:43.115
Mr Meyer, your next interruption
lands you in a jail cell.

10:43.115 --> 10:46.178
So dramatic.

10:48.050 --> 10:50.303
You had mentioned a psychosis.

10:50.303 --> 10:52.797
Scott, as the world now knows,

10:52.797 --> 10:55.660
is sexually and emotionally
obsessed with his own mother.

10:55.660 --> 10:57.553
That was mostly
what I was treating him for.

10:57.553 --> 10:59.617
–Your honor…
–Overruled.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.995
His relationship with Mrs Hooper,
there were many similarities.

11:03.995 --> 11:06.459
This was a powerful,
controlling woman.

11:06.459 --> 11:09.779
Scott saw many things in her
that he saw in his own mother,

11:09.779 --> 11:11.817
plus one huge advantage.

11:11.817 --> 11:14.768
–Which was? –He could achieve
sexual fruition with her.

11:14.768 --> 11:17.265
In my opinion, he was, on some level,

11:17.265 --> 11:20.059
making love with his own mother
when he was with Mrs Hooper.

11:20.059 --> 11:24.410
Unfortunately, he didn't
simply transfer his lust,

11:24.410 --> 11:29.484
but also his anger,
his self-loathing, his rage,

11:29.484 --> 11:32.941
the hatred he felt for himself
in loving his own mother.

11:32.941 --> 11:37.234
And since Mrs Hooper was
a participant, he hated her, too.

11:37.660 --> 11:40.853
Now I wish I'd acted sooner.

11:46.128 --> 11:48.487
We're dead.

11:57.037 --> 12:00.706
If you were so worried
about Mrs Hooper's safety,

12:00.706 --> 12:02.829
why didn't you turn
the video over to the police?

12:02.829 --> 12:04.075
I gave it to her husband.

12:04.075 --> 12:07.812
Yes, you treat the victim's
husband, judge Brian Hooper.

12:07.812 --> 12:09.083
I do.

12:09.083 --> 12:12.624
You also treated Mrs Hooper,
the victim until there was a conflict.

12:12.624 --> 12:14.442
–Correct.
–What was that conflict?

12:14.442 --> 12:15.682
That's privileged.

12:15.682 --> 12:17.434
Oh, suddenly you're
the beacon of privilege.

12:17.434 --> 12:21.538
You told Claire Simms that Mr and
Mrs Hooper were having marital problems,

12:21.538 --> 12:25.920
that he had anger towards her
because of her infidelity, didn't you?

12:25.920 --> 12:27.664
I may have indicated that.

12:27.664 --> 12:31.577
And yet, you turned the video
over to the angry husband,

12:31.577 --> 12:32.854
instead of the police.

12:32.854 --> 12:37.829
You're not concerned that you may
have given the angry husband the idea,

12:37.829 --> 12:40.802
perhaps the perfect opportunity,
to kill his wife?

12:40.802 --> 12:41.603
Objection.

12:41.603 --> 12:44.362
Providing not only motive,
but an easy scapegoat, my client.

12:44.362 --> 12:46.030
–Objection!
–Sustained.

12:46.030 --> 12:48.670
You like to embellish,
don't you, doctor?

12:48.670 --> 12:50.160
I do not embellish.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.971
Oh, come on, the prospect
of being on the news…

12:52.971 --> 12:56.172
My word of honor is one of
my most prized possessions.

12:56.172 --> 12:59.015
Did Mrs Hooper have a crush on you?

12:59.015 --> 13:00.745
You told Claire Simms that.

13:00.745 --> 13:03.231
Something about transference.

13:03.231 --> 13:07.353
The victim had developed a crush on you.

13:08.026 --> 13:09.772
Transference sometimes occurs.

13:09.772 --> 13:11.601
Yeah, 'cause you're kind
of hard to resist, I bet.

13:11.601 --> 13:13.128
Objection.

13:13.128 --> 13:16.291
Did Gina Gershon have a thing for you?

13:17.570 --> 13:20.363
You kissed her, right?

13:20.363 --> 13:23.045
Well, I'm not really comfortable
gossiping about my…

13:23.045 --> 13:25.289
You gossiped to Claire.

13:25.289 --> 13:29.060
You kissed Gina Gershon.

13:29.060 --> 13:31.102
Well, it was not a big deal.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.515
It was to Gina.

13:32.515 --> 13:35.852
Didn't you say she said it was
the best kiss of her life?

13:35.852 --> 13:38.543
Well, I'm not sure
those were her exact words.

13:38.543 --> 13:41.695
I have here a signed affidavit
from Gina Gershon,

13:41.695 --> 13:44.040
marked and identified as exhibit F.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.648
She said she's never met you.

13:46.648 --> 13:50.302
Did that kiss just
completely blow her mind?

13:52.731 --> 13:58.271
You've never even met
Gina Gershon, have you, doctor?

13:59.440 --> 14:02.899
Perjury time, doc.

14:02.899 --> 14:09.111
Have you ever met
or kissed Gina Gershon?

14:16.355 --> 14:19.028
No.

14:30.098 --> 14:34.805
Well, they actually fit quite…

14:35.530 --> 14:37.428
beautifully.

14:37.428 --> 14:45.036
Although I myself, might want
to take the inseam in just a touch.

14:45.036 --> 14:49.022
–Does that feel right?
–That feels wonderful.

14:49.455 --> 14:53.078
And the waist feels…

14:53.078 --> 14:55.430
Maybe we can let that out an inch.

14:55.430 --> 14:59.461
Now cuffs or no cuffs?

14:59.461 --> 15:02.721
I like it when you decide.

15:06.737 --> 15:09.365
Can we sit?

15:17.748 --> 15:22.239
So what's going on?

15:25.653 --> 15:30.517
There's a girl, a lovely woman.

15:30.517 --> 15:33.597
Young, fertile.

15:33.597 --> 15:36.457
We have very rewarding sex.

15:36.457 --> 15:38.132
And then she leaves.

15:38.132 --> 15:40.208
–She leaves?
–Yes.

15:40.208 --> 15:42.484
She just gets up,
and she's on her way.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.642
Are you serious about this girl?

15:44.642 --> 15:46.552
No.

15:46.746 --> 15:51.518
I suppose I'm not serious
about her at all.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.848
Still…

15:52.848 --> 15:57.882
She's denying you
your post-coital moment.

15:58.354 --> 16:00.225
I'm sure it means nothing.

16:00.225 --> 16:03.634
She's very busy at work.

16:03.634 --> 16:07.028
Well, it means you're not
content after sex, Alan.

16:07.028 --> 16:09.932
You crave sexual praise from her.

16:09.932 --> 16:12.687
And when she just
jumps out of bed,

16:12.687 --> 16:14.343
you feel rejected.

16:14.343 --> 16:21.224
I don't think I so much
crave praise as…

16:21.461 --> 16:24.984
I mean, I know I'm good.

16:25.959 --> 16:29.589
<i>They still didn't shake the gist
of Dr Simon's testimony,</i>

16:29.589 --> 16:31.349
<i>and the video spoke for itself.</i>

16:31.349 --> 16:35.511
<i>You do not undo all that with
an affidavit from Gina Gershon,</i>

16:35.511 --> 16:37.980
<i>who I've only seen play
a lesbian slut.</i>

16:37.980 --> 16:42.454
<i>I mean, don't get me wrong.
Even I snuck into Showgirls.</i>

16:44.044 --> 16:46.028
Hey.

16:46.226 --> 16:47.759
Hey.

16:47.759 --> 16:48.938
Are you okay?

16:48.938 --> 16:50.521
Yeah.

16:50.726 --> 16:52.993
Tired.

16:53.942 --> 16:55.838
You know…

16:55.838 --> 16:58.538
you can only play
the hand you're dealt,

16:58.538 --> 17:00.558
and from where I sit,

17:00.558 --> 17:03.898
you have tried a great case.

17:03.898 --> 17:07.435
Of course, there's always
the possibility that he's guilty.

17:07.435 --> 17:11.079
–This is to make me feel better?
–Yes, it is.

17:25.556 --> 17:28.612
I'm engaged.

17:28.978 --> 17:31.105
Sorry.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.842
I, um… sorry.

17:34.842 --> 17:39.811
My hand is also engaged.

17:44.763 --> 17:47.411
Denise, I…

17:48.208 --> 17:51.223
how engaged are you?

17:53.070 --> 17:55.903
Very.

18:09.118 --> 18:10.435
A therapist?

18:10.435 --> 18:13.727
She's willing to see us in my office,
so we wouldn't have to…

18:13.727 --> 18:16.634
Why do we need to see somebody?

18:16.634 --> 18:19.345
All we're doing is having sex,

18:19.345 --> 18:21.669
and it seems to be good sex.

18:21.669 --> 18:25.952
Yes, it goes to after.

18:25.952 --> 18:28.658
After? What after?

18:28.658 --> 18:30.196
You leave.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.238
What do you mean?

18:31.238 --> 18:35.434
When we're finished,
you just get up and leave.

18:35.434 --> 18:40.646
I'm feeling some post-coital isolation.

18:44.798 --> 18:46.727
How's the case going?

18:46.727 --> 18:49.687
Tough. Right now,
I would settle for murder two.

18:49.687 --> 18:52.411
How's Jeffrey Coho?

18:52.664 --> 18:56.047
You know, as a lawyer,
is he good?

18:56.047 --> 18:58.161
Yeah, he's pretty good.

19:00.649 --> 19:02.336
Did you want something, Brad?

19:02.336 --> 19:05.392
Oh, no.
No, I'm just checking in.

19:05.392 --> 19:08.056
Good luck.
–Thanks.

19:08.797 --> 19:12.787
Oh, uh, have you and
Daniel Post set the date?

19:12.787 --> 19:16.117
Uh, not yet, no.

19:24.420 --> 19:27.277
How did the affair start, Scott?

19:27.277 --> 19:29.042
One night she propositioned me.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.681
I was terrified, but, uh…

19:30.681 --> 19:32.362
Did you fall in love with her?

19:32.362 --> 19:34.162
I suppose I did.

19:34.162 --> 19:38.617
Mr Meyer, he said he saw you two
through the window sometimes,

19:38.617 --> 19:41.140
and he said that it
looked like “angry sex.”

19:41.140 --> 19:42.710
It wasn't angry.

19:42.710 --> 19:45.543
It was very physical.

19:45.543 --> 19:47.618
I could see how
it could look violent.

19:47.618 --> 19:50.409
She, uh, preferred it like that.

19:50.409 --> 19:52.042
–Violent?
–Physical.

19:52.042 --> 19:55.867
She said her husband didn't,
you know, satisfy her.

19:55.867 --> 19:57.662
She, uh…

19:57.662 --> 19:59.865
wanted me to, uh…

19:59.865 --> 20:01.660
she wasn't into gentle.

20:01.660 --> 20:05.324
Did you know that this
Lincoln Meyer was watching you?

20:05.324 --> 20:06.875
She told me about him,

20:06.875 --> 20:08.813
how she had a restraining order
against him.

20:08.813 --> 20:11.475
She thought he was sick,
a pedophile or something.

20:11.475 --> 20:14.970
–Objection!
–Mr Meyer!

20:14.970 --> 20:17.941
The night of Mrs Hooper's death,
you got there when?

20:17.941 --> 20:20.389
–About 8.
–And then what happened?

20:20.389 --> 20:21.862
We made love.

20:21.862 --> 20:26.700
We never really did a lot of talking.
She just wanted sex.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.880
Her husband testified that

20:28.880 --> 20:33.148
he told her that day
of your dreams about killing her.

20:33.148 --> 20:37.832
Well, if she knew, she certainly
didn't let on or take it seriously, because, uh…

20:37.832 --> 20:40.019
we just made love.
–And then?

20:40.019 --> 20:42.464
And then I left sometime before 9.

20:42.464 --> 20:45.154
Scott, we've heard
some pretty disturbing things

20:45.154 --> 20:48.360
about your feelings for your mother.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.057
That's why I was in treatment.

20:50.057 --> 20:53.282
Dr Simon feels you perhaps
transferred some of your feelings,

20:53.282 --> 20:56.408
perhaps even aggression
for your mother to Mrs Hooper.

20:56.408 --> 20:58.016
I probably did.

20:58.016 --> 21:00.951
They were both dominant women,
and I felt tremendous guilt.

21:00.951 --> 21:04.897
It made me think that my love
for Mrs Hooper could be just as evil,

21:04.897 --> 21:08.361
or I should say wrong,
as my love for my mother.

21:08.361 --> 21:10.348
And here it was much worse.

21:10.348 --> 21:13.037
I was actually making love
to Mrs Hooper.

21:13.037 --> 21:15.339
You dreamt of killing her,

21:15.339 --> 21:19.034
and you thought maybe God
was telling you to kill her?

21:19.034 --> 21:22.237
I had a lot self-loathing
over all of this.

21:22.237 --> 21:25.762
It likely made me hate her
on an unconscious level,

21:25.762 --> 21:28.745
but I would never act on…

21:29.478 --> 21:31.436
I'm not a violent person.

21:31.436 --> 21:33.603
I've never been violent toward anyone.

21:33.603 --> 21:35.902
–You weren't violent that night?
–No.

21:35.902 --> 21:37.958
I made love to her, and I left.

21:37.958 --> 21:40.654
I did not kill her.

21:40.654 --> 21:44.989
You testified that you were
“probably” in love with Mrs Hooper.

21:44.989 --> 21:47.029
You told the police that you weren't.
You lied.

21:47.029 --> 21:49.308
I was worried about looking suspicious.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.919
–You lied.
–On that.

21:51.919 --> 21:53.878
I told the truth
about everything else.

21:53.878 --> 21:56.865
The police asked you for the clothes
you were wearing that night.

21:56.865 --> 22:00.552
You said you got home and just
threw them all in the laundry.

22:00.552 --> 22:01.598
I did.

22:01.598 --> 22:03.806
You got home around 9 or so,
and you did laundry?

22:03.806 --> 22:07.093
I didn't want my mother
to smell a woman's perfume or…

22:07.093 --> 22:10.004
Did your mother know about this affair?

22:10.004 --> 22:11.708
I told her it was over.

22:11.708 --> 22:15.463
–You lied to her?
–About this, yes.

22:15.463 --> 22:18.814
Have any close friends?

22:19.535 --> 22:22.475
Have any close friends, Scott?

22:22.475 --> 22:24.228
I don't have any close friends.

22:24.228 --> 22:27.076
You're a loner whose only
relationship at all,

22:27.076 --> 22:30.892
as far as I can see, is a violent,
sexual one with a dominant woman

22:30.892 --> 22:32.462
who you had dreams of killing,

22:32.462 --> 22:34.670
who reminds you of your mother,
who you're in love with.

22:34.670 --> 22:35.892
–Objection.
–Overruled.

22:35.892 --> 22:37.675
–I didn't kill her.
–Are you lying right now?

22:37.675 --> 22:39.392
–No.
–You look like you're lying.

22:39.392 --> 22:42.158
I didn't kill her!

22:48.837 --> 22:50.719
Thank you.

22:57.322 --> 22:59.315
<i>“I didn't kill her.
I didn't kill her.”</i>

22:59.315 --> 23:01.684
<i>Auntie em, come back!
Auntie em, come back!</i>

23:01.684 --> 23:03.591
<i>Oh, please!</i>

23:03.591 --> 23:05.033
<i>I'm telling you—</i>

23:05.033 --> 23:06.921
What…

23:07.104 --> 23:09.288
Is Denny Crane good for anything?
I thought we…

23:09.288 --> 23:11.299
This is not a time to panic, Jeffrey.

23:11.299 --> 23:12.263
What, are you kidding?

23:12.263 --> 23:14.582
Our jury consultants said they didn't
believe Scott on the stand,

23:14.582 --> 23:17.150
the press is convicting him,
and we're down to our final witness.

23:17.150 --> 23:18.746
I'd say it's the perfect time to panic.

23:18.746 --> 23:20.469
Where is she?

23:24.292 --> 23:26.109
Hello.

23:26.516 --> 23:29.289
Could you excuse me, please?

23:29.289 --> 23:31.097
Have we met?

23:31.097 --> 23:33.560
–No.
–Would you like to meet?

23:33.560 --> 23:36.536
Barbara, we need to prep your testimony.

23:36.536 --> 23:40.618
Uh, this man is hitting on me.

23:41.112 --> 23:44.362
Jeffrey's waiting for you
in his office.

23:47.117 --> 23:49.976
What is wrong with you?

23:52.072 --> 23:57.289
If you must know, I've come down with
a slight bout of sexual insecurity.

23:57.289 --> 24:00.502
Why I'm sharing this with you,
I have no idea.

24:00.502 --> 24:03.711
Perhaps I feel a connection.

24:03.711 --> 24:06.391
Let me just bite…

24:06.391 --> 24:09.157
something.

24:17.365 --> 24:18.861
You admit your bias.

24:18.861 --> 24:21.477
Don't be dodgy about that.
Of course you're biased.

24:21.477 --> 24:22.645
Okay.

24:22.645 --> 24:26.152
Other than that, be as generous
as possible and convincing.

24:26.152 --> 24:30.057
If you can't persuade the jury
that you were home with him at 9:30…

24:30.057 --> 24:33.042
What are our chances?

24:33.448 --> 24:36.206
Honestly.

24:36.728 --> 24:39.211
They're not good.

24:40.581 --> 24:42.514
Do you have children, Mr Coho?

24:42.514 --> 24:44.751
One.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.695
She lives with her mother.

24:47.695 --> 24:50.474
And I'll bet when she was born

24:50.474 --> 24:57.180
you made a vow to yourself to never
let anything bad happen to her.

24:57.180 --> 25:00.147
I so protected Scott,

25:00.147 --> 25:02.941
homeschooled him all the way
through high school,

25:02.941 --> 25:07.010
and nothing bad ever did happen to him.

25:07.010 --> 25:09.671
But no matter what,

25:09.671 --> 25:13.053
we can't protect them.

25:14.572 --> 25:18.510
You need to save my son, Mr Coho.

25:19.607 --> 25:23.717
You need to save my son.

25:38.146 --> 25:40.938
Tell her.

25:41.220 --> 25:44.090
When you just jump up and leave, it…

25:44.090 --> 25:50.067
it makes me feel cheap,
devalued, skanky.

25:50.067 --> 25:51.473
Come on, it's hilarious!

25:51.473 --> 25:54.511
We're actually talking to a therapist
because I pop out of bed too fast.

25:54.511 --> 25:58.698
Yes, but when we were together
a year or so ago,

25:58.698 --> 26:03.083
you always used to roll over
and go to sleep after.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.675
What?

26:04.675 --> 26:05.697
Like a log.

26:05.697 --> 26:08.891
What was I supposed to do?
It was nighttime.

26:08.891 --> 26:12.404
Are you perhaps ashamed
of having relations with Alan

26:12.404 --> 26:17.108
because you perceive him
to be skanky?

26:32.888 --> 26:37.517
It was somewhere between 9:15
and 9:30 when he returned.

26:37.517 --> 26:39.402
–You're positive?
–Completely.

26:39.402 --> 26:41.147
We watch television together.

26:41.147 --> 26:44.168
And you never saw him leave
the house after he came home?

26:44.168 --> 26:45.126
No.

26:45.126 --> 26:47.579
Were you able to observe his demeanor
when he got home that night?

26:47.579 --> 26:49.974
Yes, he seemed fine.

26:49.974 --> 26:52.218
If anything, he was upbeat.

26:52.218 --> 26:53.709
He didn't look shaken or…

26:53.709 --> 26:54.748
Not at all.

26:54.748 --> 26:57.156
And he is not a stoic person.

26:57.156 --> 26:59.862
When he's upset, it shows.

26:59.862 --> 27:01.921
–For example?
–For example,

27:01.921 --> 27:05.591
when he saw on the news
that Mrs Hooper had been killed,

27:05.591 --> 27:07.563
he had an immediate panic attack.

27:07.563 --> 27:10.087
He is extremely prone to anxiety

27:10.087 --> 27:13.475
and not at all capable
of concealing it.

27:13.475 --> 27:14.782
Now you're his mother.

27:14.782 --> 27:18.832
Yes. And I am biased, of course,

27:18.832 --> 27:21.042
but that doesn't change the truth

27:21.042 --> 27:25.268
that he came home
between 9:15 and 9:30,

27:25.268 --> 27:28.958
and he did not go out again.

27:28.958 --> 27:32.188
Did you see him do laundry
when he got home?

27:32.188 --> 27:33.474
He may have done laundry.

27:33.474 --> 27:34.471
You didn't really keep track of him?

27:34.471 --> 27:36.353
I know he didn't leave the house.

27:36.353 --> 27:39.019
You son is your life,
isn't he, Ms Little?

27:39.019 --> 27:41.726
I love my son, like any parent.

27:41.726 --> 27:44.084
And the idea of him
going to prison,

27:44.084 --> 27:47.614
oh, boy, I bet you would do
almost anything to prevent that.

27:47.614 --> 27:50.963
I've admitted my bias,
but I am telling the truth.

27:50.963 --> 27:53.097
Somebody killed Marcia Hooper.
Who—

27:53.097 --> 27:55.360
Did you question all the men
she was sleeping with?

27:55.360 --> 27:57.021
We did, thank you.

27:57.021 --> 27:58.951
When the police first questioned you,

27:58.951 --> 28:01.524
you denied having any knowledge
of Scott's affair with the victim.

28:01.524 --> 28:03.466
That was a lie, wasn't it?

28:03.466 --> 28:05.070
I am not lying now.

28:05.070 --> 28:06.995
You lied then because you didn't
want to implicate him,

28:06.995 --> 28:08.695
just like you're lying right now.

28:08.695 --> 28:09.704
–I'm not lying.
–Objection.

28:09.704 --> 28:11.250
At your custody proceeding,

28:11.250 --> 28:14.923
you accused that man right there
of molesting Scott, did you not?

28:14.923 --> 28:18.219
You later admitted to the court
that that was a lie.

28:18.219 --> 28:21.944
First of all,
that was 20 years ago or so.

28:21.944 --> 28:24.843
Why'd you lie to the court, Ms Little?

28:24.843 --> 28:28.751
I felt it was in Scott's best interest
for me to have full custody.

28:28.751 --> 28:31.310
And you would do almost anything
to protect him,

28:31.310 --> 28:35.278
even commit perjury.

28:35.487 --> 28:37.427
I am not lying now.

28:37.427 --> 28:40.331
Yes, we have your word on that.

28:41.132 --> 28:43.308
Nothing further.

28:43.308 --> 28:46.890
Mr Coho, anything on redirect?

28:49.976 --> 28:52.299
Mr Coho?

28:54.751 --> 28:57.223
Mr Coho?

28:58.828 --> 29:01.319
Ms Little…

29:01.319 --> 29:04.144
have you been lying to protect Scott?

29:04.144 --> 29:06.936
–No.
–According to your ex-husband Mr Schiller,

29:06.936 --> 29:09.194
you had to know
Scott was in love with you.

29:09.194 --> 29:10.253
He's wrong.

29:10.253 --> 29:11.836
He says you let it happen.

29:11.836 --> 29:18.218
Have you known all along that your son
has sexual feelings for you?

29:18.218 --> 29:18.935
No!

29:18.935 --> 29:22.878
Have you done anything to cultivate
Scott's physical interest in you?

29:22.878 --> 29:24.207
I beg your pardon?

29:24.207 --> 29:26.209
What is he doing?

29:26.209 --> 29:29.544
–Do you date, Ms Little?
–What's going on here?

29:29.544 --> 29:33.479
What's going on is I'm suddenly
wondering if this love affair was mutual.

29:33.479 --> 29:37.524
Have you been on a date with
a man in say, the last six years?

29:37.524 --> 29:39.763
What are you suggesting, Mr Coho?

29:39.763 --> 29:41.519
Are you in love with your son?

29:41.519 --> 29:42.569
No!

29:42.569 --> 29:44.564
Have you had sex with your son?

29:44.564 --> 29:46.651
–Did you tell him that, Scott?
–Do not address the defendant.

29:46.651 --> 29:47.729
–Scott!
–Ms Little!

29:47.729 --> 29:49.662
I think the question
needs to be asked.

29:49.662 --> 29:52.612
Did you leave the house
that night, Ms Little?

29:52.612 --> 29:55.034
The same car would leave
the same tire tracks.

29:55.034 --> 29:57.760
You'd also have the garage
clicker to get in.

29:57.760 --> 30:01.754
Did you go to Marcia Hooper's
house after perhaps realizing

30:01.754 --> 30:05.169
that Scott had not broken off
the affair as he said he had?

30:05.169 --> 30:06.571
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

30:06.571 --> 30:09.872
It would certainly explain why the house
was found entirely free of prints,

30:09.872 --> 30:13.470
not knowing what Scott had touched,
not wanting him to go to jail,

30:13.470 --> 30:14.965
you went through everything.

30:14.965 --> 30:16.281
What do you think you're doing?

30:16.281 --> 30:19.436
Your husband once overheard you
arguing with Scott.

30:19.436 --> 30:23.159
You were crazed at the idea that
Scott was in love with Marcia Hooper.

30:23.159 --> 30:24.847
I didn't kill Marcia Hooper.

30:24.847 --> 30:26.173
Oh, I'm sure you didn't mean to.

30:26.173 --> 30:28.567
You probably drove
over there to confront her,

30:28.567 --> 30:31.011
got into an argument
and in a fit of anger,

30:31.011 --> 30:33.603
picked up the statuette
and swung.

30:33.603 --> 30:36.498
Is that what happened, Barbara?

30:36.893 --> 30:40.044
Is that what happened?

30:40.044 --> 30:43.262
I want an attorney.

30:44.113 --> 30:45.415
You want an attorney?

30:45.415 --> 30:49.617
I have a Fifth Amendment right
not to answer these ridiculous questions,

30:49.617 --> 30:50.831
and I want an attorney!

30:50.831 --> 30:53.658
Your son was trying to break away
from you with another woman.

30:53.658 --> 30:55.550
You wouldn't stand for it!

30:55.550 --> 30:58.151
I want an attorney.

31:16.919 --> 31:19.368
Well, what do you know?

31:19.368 --> 31:21.271
You staged that.

31:21.271 --> 31:24.818
You and Barbara conspired to put on
that little one-act play.

31:24.818 --> 31:26.539
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:26.539 --> 31:29.459
Were you in on it?

31:29.641 --> 31:31.969
Why didn't you tell me in advance
that you planned to cross?

31:31.969 --> 31:33.940
–It just came to me.
–It just came to you?

31:33.940 --> 31:36.167
Wow, wow!
So in addition to risking disbarment,

31:36.167 --> 31:38.725
you may have just guaranteed
his conviction!

31:38.725 --> 31:41.475
If I can see through it, Jeffrey,
you know the jury can.

31:41.475 --> 31:43.325
They don't have
your far-fetched imagination.

31:43.325 --> 31:45.367
You've just committed
a fraud on the court!

31:45.367 --> 31:47.628
I've done no such thing,
but if I had,

31:47.628 --> 31:52.877
you should be glad I didn't tell you,
since you'd be obligated to tell.

31:53.675 --> 31:56.952
You'd better hope the jury
is more gullible than I am.

31:56.952 --> 31:59.814
All I need is one.

32:09.023 --> 32:11.720
Did anybody fall for that?

32:11.720 --> 32:13.640
First he said the husband did it.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.090
Then it was all those other men
she was having an affair with.

32:16.090 --> 32:17.392
Then, I can't be sure,

32:17.392 --> 32:20.062
but I think he actually seemed
to accuse the father,

32:20.062 --> 32:21.549
at least briefly.

32:21.549 --> 32:24.404
Oh, and let's not forget
Lincoln Meyer, the neighbor.

32:24.404 --> 32:26.695
He wanted you to think
that he was the killer.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.118
And then finally,

32:28.118 --> 32:32.344
in the most desperate and
transparent attempt of all,

32:32.344 --> 32:34.824
he goes after Scott's mother.

32:34.824 --> 32:37.400
And she played along perfectly,
didn't she?

32:37.400 --> 32:38.599
“I want an attorney.”

32:38.599 --> 32:40.414
“I assert my Fifth Amendment right.”

32:40.414 --> 32:45.201
Gee, that ought to give them all
reasonable doubt.

32:45.404 --> 32:47.838
The evidence, all of it,

32:47.838 --> 32:50.881
points to one person
being in the house,

32:50.881 --> 32:56.542
the defendant, a sick, twisted
psychologically infirm young man

32:56.542 --> 32:59.557
loaded with anger, self-loathing.

32:59.557 --> 33:04.907
He confessed to his therapist
he had compulsions of killing her.

33:04.907 --> 33:08.850
Gee, I wonder who could have done it.

33:09.141 --> 33:15.553
If any of you were fooled by the defense
lawyer's ridiculous Perry Mason theatrics,

33:15.553 --> 33:18.575
then shame on you.

33:18.575 --> 33:19.756
Shame on you?

33:19.756 --> 33:23.876
How about shame on the police for
investigating nobody else but Scott Little?

33:23.876 --> 33:28.017
As soon as they saw a video
of Scott talking about killing Marcia Hooper,

33:28.017 --> 33:30.539
it was case closed for them.

33:30.539 --> 33:33.656
Could they not have looked
at the husband?

33:33.656 --> 33:35.469
He had motive.
He was there.

33:35.469 --> 33:39.244
He has no real alibi.
He made no attempt to save her.

33:39.244 --> 33:41.386
Could they not have looked
at Lincoln Meyer,

33:41.386 --> 33:44.138
the card-carrying nut job
from next door?

33:44.138 --> 33:46.077
He was obsessed with Marcia Hooper.

33:46.077 --> 33:48.503
She had to get a restraining
order to keep him away.

33:48.503 --> 33:52.568
His flowers were found in the room
where she was murdered.

33:52.568 --> 33:54.386
And yes, Barbara Little.

33:54.386 --> 33:58.814
Let's face it. Love obsessions
rarely occur in a vacuum.

33:58.814 --> 34:01.811
Could she not have loved him
just as much?

34:01.811 --> 34:04.059
Her whole life is her son.

34:04.059 --> 34:07.787
The idea of him falling into
the clutches of another woman…

34:07.787 --> 34:10.847
Why was that house so clean of prints?

34:10.847 --> 34:15.460
The killer will typically wipe clean
just what he or she has touched.

34:15.460 --> 34:18.808
But if she didn't know what
Scott had previously touched,

34:18.808 --> 34:21.580
she would have cleaned everything.

34:21.580 --> 34:24.609
How can any of us be sure here?

34:24.609 --> 34:27.797
As for physical evidence,
the only thing the prosecution can establish

34:27.797 --> 34:32.143
is that Scott Little made love
to Marcia Hooper the night of the murder.

34:32.143 --> 34:34.333
Well, he told them that.

34:34.333 --> 34:37.045
He came forward
as innocent people tend to do,

34:37.045 --> 34:39.268
and volunteered the information.

34:39.268 --> 34:41.655
And the only reason they arrested him,

34:41.655 --> 34:46.165
was because of a video and an opinion
proferred by an eccentric therapist

34:46.165 --> 34:50.873
who runs around telling people
he's kissed movie stars he's never even met.

34:50.873 --> 34:54.648
This case can't turn on his credibility.

34:54.648 --> 34:56.838
Talk about reasonable doubt.

34:56.838 --> 34:58.434
Reasonable doubt.

34:58.434 --> 35:00.573
Come on, it could have been him,

35:00.573 --> 35:02.327
could have been him,

35:02.327 --> 35:04.666
could have been her.

35:04.868 --> 35:09.789
This whole case screams
“reasonable doubt,”

35:09.789 --> 35:16.191
which is typically the case
when the police don't investigate.

35:42.339 --> 35:44.076
Oh, my God.

35:44.319 --> 35:46.226
That was amazing.

35:50.466 --> 35:55.088
Yeah, you're a different girl.

35:55.678 --> 35:57.600
Wow.

35:59.196 --> 36:01.996
That's all I have to say.

36:25.136 --> 36:27.479
Ladies and gentlemen,
before we read the verdict,

36:27.479 --> 36:31.137
I will caution everyone
in this room to maintain order.

36:31.137 --> 36:33.744
The defendant will please rise.

36:37.688 --> 36:41.385
Mr Foreman, the jury's
verdict is unanimous?

36:41.385 --> 36:43.117
Yes, your honor.

36:44.704 --> 36:47.285
In the matter of the commonwealth
vs Scott Little,

36:47.285 --> 36:49.422
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

36:49.422 --> 36:52.839
we the jury find the defendant
Scott Little

36:52.839 --> 36:54.620
not guilty.

36:54.620 --> 36:56.826
On the charge of murder
in the second degree,

36:56.826 --> 37:00.275
we the jury find the defendant
Scott Little

37:00.275 --> 37:02.425
not guilty.

37:02.425 --> 37:04.144
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
this completes your service.

37:04.144 --> 37:05.653
I can't believe it.

37:05.653 --> 37:08.224
–It's over?
–It's over.

37:27.362 --> 37:29.382
Thank you.
No comment just yet.

37:29.382 --> 37:30.467
Thank you.

37:30.467 --> 37:32.608
Just give us a minute. Thanks.

37:32.843 --> 37:34.380
Thank you.

37:36.124 --> 37:39.018
I don't know what to say.

37:44.587 --> 37:46.838
Well, we need to say something,

37:46.838 --> 37:50.000
or the media will be camped
where we live.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.829
You okay?

37:52.870 --> 37:54.890
Yeah.

37:56.198 --> 37:58.768
Thank you.

37:59.564 --> 38:01.866
Let's get this over with.

38:04.632 --> 38:06.030
Okay, hear all, people.

38:06.030 --> 38:07.570
Back off.

38:07.570 --> 38:09.880
Please, back off.

38:10.368 --> 38:12.394
Are you okay, honey?

38:12.394 --> 38:14.353
Yeah.

38:14.353 --> 38:16.520
Mom, how did he know?

38:16.520 --> 38:18.110
He knows nothing, baby.

38:18.110 --> 38:21.027
As far as Mr Coho is concerned,
it was all a tactic.

38:21.027 --> 38:23.212
He has no idea.

38:23.212 --> 38:25.202
But what if they arrest you now?

38:25.202 --> 38:27.973
There's no evidence to arrest me.

38:27.973 --> 38:31.005
And you know,
if they ever did convict you,

38:31.005 --> 38:35.237
I would have come forward
with the truth. You do know that.

38:35.237 --> 38:38.365
You are all I have,

38:38.365 --> 38:41.329
and I love you.

38:43.728 --> 38:46.995
I love you, too.

39:00.933 --> 39:02.178
You ready?

39:02.178 --> 39:03.655
Ready.

39:03.655 --> 39:06.274
Let's get out of dodge.

39:10.888 --> 39:13.154
I'm sure you all have
lots of questions,

39:13.154 --> 39:15.671
and I want to try
to get to everybody…

39:20.340 --> 39:22.366
She dumped you?

39:22.366 --> 39:26.568
Well, I think we're looking
for different things.

39:26.568 --> 39:28.757
What are you looking for,
a serious relationship?

39:28.757 --> 39:31.229
Don't be silly.
I'm already involved with you.

39:31.229 --> 39:33.601
You're damn right.

39:33.889 --> 39:36.189
I just don't like my sex
to be empty, Denny.

39:36.189 --> 39:39.679
I need intimacy, at least.
–Me, too.

39:39.679 --> 39:44.154
That's why I have Shirley Schmidtho.

39:45.118 --> 39:48.725
I hit on Barbara Little,
the client's mother,

39:48.725 --> 39:52.358
then Denise.
My insecurity is rampant.

39:52.358 --> 39:54.787
We're, we're sensitive men.

39:54.787 --> 39:56.968
Alan, that's who we are.

39:56.968 --> 39:59.864
We're needy people.

40:00.044 --> 40:02.795
Do you think we could get your therapist
to measure me for trousers?

40:02.795 --> 40:06.140
I need more room.

40:06.140 --> 40:09.864
Oh, don't expect me to go for that.

40:10.471 --> 40:15.642
Sometimes the depth of your sensitivity,
well, let's just say…

40:15.642 --> 40:18.923
–I reach new depths.
–You do.

40:18.923 --> 40:21.939
How are things going with Bethany?

40:22.854 --> 40:25.300
Three dates.

40:25.300 --> 40:28.151
Big one coming up.

40:28.151 --> 40:31.553
You think she'd be upset if she
discovered Gracie Jane in your pants?

40:31.553 --> 40:34.012
No idea.

40:35.492 --> 40:36.603
–Not a chance.
–Oh, yes.

40:36.603 --> 40:37.896
–Don't lie to me.
–Scout's honor.

40:37.896 --> 40:39.751
I am not looking down.

40:39.751 --> 40:42.227
But you must.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.990
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

40:48.990 --> 40:54.002
I don't date disgusting, vile pigs!

40:55.414 --> 40:56.952
In the doghouse again.

40:56.952 --> 40:59.953
I gotta get that woman
a pair of squeaky shoes.

40:59.953 --> 41:01.605
You want to go after her?

41:01.605 --> 41:03.003
In time.

41:03.003 --> 41:07.391
She's got to learn
not to interrupt my special time.

41:07.391 --> 41:11.357
To special times and new depths.

41:11.610 --> 41:14.614
–My needy friend.
–Indeed.

41:17.828 --> 41:19.210
Want to pull my string?

41:19.210 --> 41:21.007
Maybe later.

41:21.582 --> 41:24.075
