00:34.764 --> 00:37.673
Next friday, our children will
be asked a question.

00:38.084 --> 00:39.520
How they answer that

00:39.523 --> 00:41.396
will define us all.

00:41.903 --> 00:43.481
The question is :

00:43.495 --> 00:45.239
when victory and defeat,

00:45.244 --> 00:47.629
life and death,
hang in the balance,

00:47.634 --> 00:49.799
what... are... you...

00:49.906 --> 00:51.470
capable of ?

00:53.943 --> 00:56.105
State championship !

00:56.118 --> 00:57.489
<i>Number one !</i>

00:57.529 --> 00:58.861
<i>Number one !</i>

01:00.119 --> 01:02.313
Same speech he gives every year.

01:02.317 --> 01:04.363
That's because
it works every year.

01:07.645 --> 01:09.952
What are you doing ?
You hate football.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.811
My brother's on the team.

01:11.815 --> 01:13.640
You hate your brother.

01:15.245 --> 01:16.133
Besides,

01:16.146 --> 01:18.192
did I ask you not to
go to the pep rally ?

01:18.205 --> 01:20.660
Did I ask you to dump
the quarterback ?

01:21.198 --> 01:23.701
- Very nice.
- Come on, guys.

01:23.707 --> 01:25.571
We're all tired,
we're all hungry

01:25.578 --> 01:27.682
and we all know the second you
get some of this pizza,

01:27.688 --> 01:30.003
you'll remember how much
you love each other.

01:32.818 --> 01:33.891
You ok ?

01:33.978 --> 01:36.461
Yeah. It's just a little cough,
it's not going to kill me.

01:39.006 --> 01:40.352
Thanks for hanging with me.

01:40.365 --> 01:41.843
Always.

01:42.157 --> 01:43.381
Besides,

01:43.418 --> 01:46.520
thank your daddy for leaving
us the house all weekend.

01:59.847 --> 02:01.233
I need some air.

02:03.118 --> 02:04.422
Give me this.

02:07.588 --> 02:08.850
- Polly.
- Yeah ?

02:09.286 --> 02:11.271
Go on. I'll be right in.

02:24.806 --> 02:27.192
- Okay, I'm going to go shower.
- Okay.

02:40.177 --> 02:43.133
Hey, garbage girl,
better not forget to wash your hands.

02:52.808 --> 02:55.372
Do what I say, Polly,
or Brooke and Kelly die.

02:56.166 --> 02:57.682
Now, get dressed.

03:04.926 --> 03:06.462
Are you ok ?

03:08.157 --> 03:09.783
What does this guy want ?

03:10.178 --> 03:11.241
I don't know.

03:11.836 --> 03:13.713
Did you tell him our names ?

03:14.497 --> 03:16.240
- What ?
- He called us by name.

03:16.256 --> 03:17.823
Did you tell him ?

03:18.358 --> 03:19.040
No.

03:19.695 --> 03:21.603
She's right.
He knew our names.

03:22.486 --> 03:25.032
- What does that mean ?
- That he knows us,

03:25.256 --> 03:27.250
that he's someone we know ?

03:27.628 --> 03:30.033
Well, if he knows us,
why hasn't he talked to us ?

03:30.206 --> 03:32.272
'Cause he's some kind of freak !

03:36.525 --> 03:38.273
If he comes back,

03:38.288 --> 03:39.990
we have to fight him together.

03:39.995 --> 03:40.961
Right.

03:40.968 --> 03:43.343
This time, we fight,
no matter what.

03:43.356 --> 03:46.031
Okay ? He can't take all 3 of us
at the same time.

03:46.037 --> 03:48.151
We all attack him at once.

03:48.836 --> 03:51.013
Are you sure you're okay ?

03:51.045 --> 03:53.310
God !
What does this guy want ?

03:53.328 --> 03:54.682
To choose.

04:03.588 --> 04:05.062
To choose what ?

04:05.375 --> 04:07.631
Two of you will leave
this room alive...

04:10.026 --> 04:11.640
one of you will die.

04:13.247 --> 04:14.470
You choose.

04:57.815 --> 04:59.052
Mrs. Homefeldt ?

04:59.055 --> 05:00.710
Hi. I'm agent Jareau.

05:00.715 --> 05:02.380
Thank you for seeing me.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.720
- My aunt said it was an emergency.
- Yeah.

05:05.357 --> 05:07.222
She said to give this to you.

05:07.998 --> 05:09.313
You played soccer.

05:11.505 --> 05:12.911
I  don't understand.

05:12.947 --> 05:15.692
My daughter Polly, played soccer
too, for North Mammon.

05:15.695 --> 05:18.920
The varsity team. She got a scholarship
to Penn State.

05:20.206 --> 05:21.483
Forgive me, ma'am.

05:21.485 --> 05:23.600
My aunt didn't really
explain to me

05:23.618 --> 05:25.082
the nature of this emergency.

05:25.097 --> 05:27.001
No one is looking for them.

05:30.055 --> 05:31.052
Here.

05:31.308 --> 05:32.601
My daughter

05:32.718 --> 05:34.313
and her two friends,

05:34.315 --> 05:36.210
they've been missing for 5 days,

05:36.227 --> 05:38.661
and I know someone took them,
but no one will believe me.

05:38.758 --> 05:40.992
- Missing ?
- Yeah.

05:42.808 --> 05:44.870
This... this here... this...

05:45.336 --> 05:48.283
this is you, right ?
I mean, you found this girl, right ?

05:48.396 --> 05:49.751
No, no, not just me.

05:50.135 --> 05:51.912
The team here did.

05:51.926 --> 05:53.530
It's been 5 days now.

05:53.548 --> 05:55.213
Can you ask them to help me ?

05:55.997 --> 05:58.583
Because no one
is looking for my Polly.

06:02.526 --> 06:04.521
Well, as much as we might want
to take this case,

06:04.538 --> 06:06.692
we have to be invited
by local authorities.

06:06.697 --> 06:08.901
I'm sure that this friend of
your aunt's is very concerned,

06:08.915 --> 06:10.870
but it just doesn't work that way.

06:10.886 --> 06:12.363
I called the police chief.

06:12.377 --> 06:14.941
He faxed over an official request
for our assistance.

06:17.896 --> 06:20.161
This is Brooke Chambers.
Her father, Peter,

06:20.176 --> 06:22.562
a widower, left her home alone
for the weekend.

06:22.838 --> 06:25.133
Polly Homefeldt and Kelly Seymour

06:25.146 --> 06:27.093
were sleeping over
saturday night.

06:27.097 --> 06:30.690
À 21h35 lors du rassemblement
pour encourager l'équipe de foot,

06:31.015 --> 06:33.213
both Kelly and Polly
called home.

06:33.228 --> 06:34.170
<i>It's me.</i>

06:34.615 --> 06:37.250
<i>I know this is last minute,
but please don't be angry.</i>

06:37.265 --> 06:39.060
<i>Brooke, Kelly and I
are going to take off</i>

06:39.086 --> 06:40.581
<i>on a road trip for a few days,</i>

06:40.595 --> 06:43.101
<i>sort  of our last adventure
before graduation.</i>

06:43.115 --> 06:45.303
<i>We'll be back friday night.
Love you.</i>

06:45.766 --> 06:46.582
<i>Bye.</i>

06:46.947 --> 06:49.401
Kelly Seymour left this message
on her parents'machine

06:49.405 --> 06:51.101
44 seconds later.

06:51.425 --> 06:52.511
<i>It's me.</i>

06:52.528 --> 06:55.321
<i>I know this is last minute,
but please don't be angry.</i>

06:55.448 --> 06:57.212
<i>Brooke, Polly, and I
are going to take off</i>

06:57.227 --> 06:58.991
<i>on a road trip for a few days,</i>

06:59.006 --> 07:01.380
sort of our last adventure
before graduation.

07:01.647 --> 07:03.311
We'll be back friday night.

07:03.355 --> 07:04.981
Love you, bye.

07:05.427 --> 07:08.072
- Exactly the same.
- Word for word.

07:08.557 --> 07:11.103
Both calls made were made
from Brooke's cell, which has since

07:11.117 --> 07:12.161
been turned off. 

07:12.178 --> 07:15.431
And there's been no activity on their
cell phones or atm cards since saturday.

07:15.628 --> 07:17.541
It does sound like they were
reading from a script.

07:17.555 --> 07:20.390
And obviously, since the phone's turned
off, I can't use it to locate the girls,

07:20.408 --> 07:23.103
but I have an open trap on the number
in case it gets turned back on.

07:23.115 --> 07:25.390
Okay, guys, guys, not for nothing.

07:25.406 --> 07:27.553
I remember my senior year
in high school.

07:27.566 --> 07:29.602
Isn't it possible these girls
just took off on a road trip ?

07:29.615 --> 07:30.280
No.

07:32.596 --> 07:34.090
Absolutely not.

07:34.898 --> 07:37.753
Polly  accepted an athletic
scholarship to Penn state.

07:40.787 --> 07:43.300
I was a high school athlete,
just like these girls.

07:45.396 --> 07:47.150
I was these girls.

07:47.705 --> 07:48.553
They don't smoke,

07:48.565 --> 07:50.772
they don't do drugs,
they don't drink during the season,

07:50.775 --> 07:53.251
and they do not jeopardize
a full-ride scholarship

07:53.255 --> 07:55.791
by cutting school
and missing practice.

07:57.256 --> 07:58.162
Okay.

07:58.636 --> 07:59.970
I hear you, JJ.

08:00.963 --> 08:02.695
It has been 5 days.

08:03.668 --> 08:05.439
There's a chance these girls...

08:08.689 --> 08:10.501
There's a chance
we may not find them.

08:10.519 --> 08:11.893
I don't think so.

08:11.907 --> 08:14.251
- Why not ?
- The phone messages.

08:14.265 --> 08:17.280
If they were reading from a script,
they said, "I'll see you next friday",

08:17.296 --> 08:19.842
not two days, not two weeks,
friday.

08:19.908 --> 08:21.632
Why be that specific ?

08:22.526 --> 08:24.913
My guess is we have until friday
to find them.

08:24.928 --> 08:26.143
Two days.

08:26.657 --> 08:28.603
So, are we taking this case ?

08:32.476 --> 08:34.172
Wheels up in 30 minutes.

08:54.848 --> 08:57.410
<i>Legendary basketball coach
John Wooden said,</i>

08:58.105 --> 09:00.182
<i>"it's not so important
who starts the game,</i>

09:00.227 --> 09:01.640
<i>but who finishes it."</i>

09:02.418 --> 09:03.071
Hi,

09:03.558 --> 09:06.003
I'm sergeant Sykes,
Tom, if you want.

09:06.076 --> 09:07.390
Derek Morgan.

09:07.737 --> 09:10.330
- Agent Gideon, Dr. Reid.
- Jason Gideon. How are you ?

09:10.345 --> 09:12.222
Hope we haven't brought you folks
out here for nothing.

09:12.228 --> 09:13.483
You don't believe
the girls are missing ?

09:13.495 --> 09:16.212
It's not really the kind of thing
that happens around here, you know ?

09:16.215 --> 09:18.220
You'd be surprised to know
how many times we hear that.

09:18.235 --> 09:19.872
Still, I've been through
the house myself

09:19.885 --> 09:21.693
and nothing looks
out of place at all.

09:21.708 --> 09:24.170
- You talk to chambers, the father ?
- Haven't located him yet.

09:24.187 --> 09:26.092
- Is that unusual ?
- Chambers is a lawyer.

09:26.106 --> 09:28.111
He's always out of town
on business.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.073
November 3rd.
That's tomorrow.

09:30.088 --> 09:31.523
State championship football game.

09:31.525 --> 09:33.361
North Mammon
is finally back in it.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.142
Show us inside.

09:48.135 --> 09:50.483
Chief Yates, Jennifer Jareau,
we spoke on the phone.

09:50.496 --> 09:52.073
- Hi.
- This is agent hotchner.

09:52.085 --> 09:53.991
Hi, Jeff Yates.
Hi, Judy.

09:54.007 --> 09:57.013
Hey, why don't you go on inside
and make yourself comfortable.

09:57.017 --> 09:59.012
- We'll be in in a minute.
- Okay.

09:59.567 --> 10:02.111
Chief Yates, there's not much
of a case file yet.

10:02.918 --> 10:05.890
Listen, I can't get anyone to agree
the girls are actually missing.

10:05.908 --> 10:07.873
Mrs. Homefeldt certainly believes it.

10:07.886 --> 10:10.970
Yeah, well, I wouldn't put too much
stock in what Judy Homefeldt thinks.

10:11.215 --> 10:12.243
Why is that ?

10:12.256 --> 10:14.581
She's got a history of mental problems.

10:14.756 --> 10:16.722
- What kind of history ?
- Depression.

10:16.738 --> 10:18.992
Just heard she's even
on medication.

10:20.276 --> 10:22.701
Didn't she raise Polly
on her own

10:22.716 --> 10:24.251
after her husband abandoned her,

10:24.265 --> 10:26.722
- what, 12 years ago ?
- That's right. Yeah.

10:26.736 --> 10:29.840
If you were in her place, don't you
think you'd be a little depressed ?

10:30.855 --> 10:32.021
Point taken.

10:32.037 --> 10:33.650
Chief, if you're not sure
the girls are missing,

10:33.668 --> 10:35.233
why would you request our help ?

10:35.246 --> 10:38.331
Listen, something happened.
I'm just not sure what and if it's bad,

10:38.346 --> 10:40.683
I'll take all the help
I can get.

10:40.697 --> 10:44.112
Plus, your agent Jareau
can be pretty convincing.

10:44.466 --> 10:46.902
- Are the parents inside ?
- Well, kelly's parents are in there.

10:46.918 --> 10:49.682
We still haven't been able
to track down Brooke's father, Pete.

10:49.695 --> 10:51.610
He's... well, he travels a lot.

10:51.625 --> 10:54.021
Listen, these people
are my friends, okay ?

10:54.027 --> 10:57.013
Let me tell you... they're my neighbors,
good people.

10:57.688 --> 11:00.490
I don't want anybody assuming
that they're involved.

11:00.498 --> 11:02.832
We just got here,
we're not assuming anything.

11:04.905 --> 11:06.083
Go ahead.

11:08.475 --> 11:10.200
You were right, sergeant.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.131
No forced entry,

11:12.396 --> 11:13.433
no  sign of struggle.

11:13.446 --> 11:16.133
If someone did attack these girls,
they chose to comply pretty fast.

11:16.146 --> 11:17.963
- If.
- There were only two ways

11:17.967 --> 11:20.380
to immediately get compliance
without the use of force,

11:20.385 --> 11:22.080
that's either
the threat of force or

11:22.085 --> 11:24.172
previously established trust.

11:24.937 --> 11:27.302
Whoever it was,
it took a lot of planning.

11:27.916 --> 11:30.142
Detailed information
about the girls.

11:30.995 --> 11:32.371
When Brooke's father was gone,

11:32.375 --> 11:35.003
- when the other parents were out.
- How do you mean ?

11:35.005 --> 11:36.241
He knew they'd have
to leave messages.

11:36.425 --> 11:39.301
With that script, they couldn't have
talked to the parents directly.

11:39.315 --> 11:41.461
Close family friend
or a stalker.

11:41.477 --> 11:44.481
The folks here look after each other.
There's no way an outsider

11:44.497 --> 11:47.000
stalked these girls
without being noticed.

11:47.105 --> 11:49.443
We have to assume the people
who abducted these girls

11:49.455 --> 11:51.533
were members of the community.

11:53.116 --> 11:55.162
Would have needed a spot

11:55.575 --> 11:57.591
to watch her from.

12:02.257 --> 12:04.012
Should we expect
a ransom demand ?

12:04.028 --> 12:06.182
Kidnappers who want money
contact the families

12:06.186 --> 12:07.881
to prove they have possession
of the victim.

12:07.898 --> 12:09.673
They don't call to conceal it.

12:09.815 --> 12:12.680
Kidnappers. Are we sure
they just haven't run off ?

12:12.695 --> 12:15.363
It's pretty unusual the girls
left identical messages.

12:15.378 --> 12:16.612
They feel scripted.

12:16.617 --> 12:19.140
- Why would Kelly run off ?
- Here's the thing.

12:19.577 --> 12:20.951
This is a football town,

12:21.146 --> 12:24.311
Kelly plays girl's soccer.
Our son is on the football team.

12:24.937 --> 12:27.691
This week, the football is
all anyone cares about.

12:27.707 --> 12:29.582
That didn't always
sit right with Kelly.

12:29.598 --> 12:30.930
Should it, Gill ?

12:30.946 --> 12:33.150
Should her being told
that she's not as important

12:33.168 --> 12:34.722
sit right with her ?

12:34.725 --> 12:37.971
- I didn't say she wasn't as important.
- You never said it.

12:38.545 --> 12:41.122
No, it's going to be all right.

12:41.137 --> 12:42.981
She'll be back after the game,
you'll see.

12:42.995 --> 12:45.623
Come on, I got some tissue
in the office.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.561
You can see all the windows
from here.

12:59.705 --> 13:02.233
Someone's spent a lot of time here.

13:02.247 --> 13:04.623
- Damn.
- Has it rained since saturday night ?

13:04.876 --> 13:05.560
No.

13:10.486 --> 13:13.532
He who seeks the queen of all knowledge,
speak and be recognized.

13:13.545 --> 13:15.372
Garcia, we're sending you
some cigarettes.

13:15.388 --> 13:16.422
Yeah,

13:16.437 --> 13:19.321
why not a flesh-eating virus ?
It'll be faster and far less painful.

13:19.338 --> 13:22.091
We need some butts rushed
to the lab for DNA analysis.

13:22.095 --> 13:25.002
Oh, Reid, I love it
when you say butts.

13:25.017 --> 13:26.190
<i>Send away, sugar.</i>

13:26.195 --> 13:27.803
Bang bang for now.

13:28.997 --> 13:32.071
Do you really think someone
from our town's involved in this ?

13:32.337 --> 13:35.350
You said it yourself,
an outsider would have been noticed.

13:35.808 --> 13:37.151
Sergeant Sykes.

13:39.025 --> 13:39.803
What ?

13:41.046 --> 13:43.343
Looks like chief Yates won himself
a title back in the day.

13:43.358 --> 13:46.381
- They do like their football.
- Trust me, it's like a religion.

13:46.398 --> 13:48.623
Do you think it strange
that with three girls missing,

13:48.638 --> 13:51.153
nobody's talking about canceling
tomorrow night's game ?

13:51.415 --> 13:53.283
Come on, Hotch, it's football.

13:53.296 --> 13:54.912
They know they can play
without girls.

13:54.926 --> 13:57.650
Just found Brooke's car... abandoned.

14:02.436 --> 14:03.732
I'm freezing.

14:03.737 --> 14:05.630
We're all cold,
we're all hungry.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.553
She has a fever.

14:07.568 --> 14:09.783
Complaining about it isn't going
to make it any better.

14:09.796 --> 14:11.653
Do you have to be so mean ?

14:11.656 --> 14:14.693
Mean ? Some jerk locks us
in a box, and I'm mean ?

14:14.706 --> 14:17.230
You don't see Brooke
and me jumping on you about it.

14:17.245 --> 14:19.251
I don't see you or Brooke
doing a damn thing !

14:19.266 --> 14:20.452
Guys,

14:21.075 --> 14:22.952
this is what he wants.

14:24.288 --> 14:26.610
How long have we been 
down here ?

14:27.536 --> 14:29.371
We don't even know where here is.

14:29.386 --> 14:31.370
He doesn't want us to know.

14:31.386 --> 14:33.561
He wants to break us down.

14:34.505 --> 14:36.773
It's called sensory depravation.

14:37.567 --> 14:40.222
It's not going to work !

14:40.237 --> 14:43.651
You hear me, you son of a bitch ?!
It's not going to work !

14:43.666 --> 14:46.111
Yes, it will.

14:47.437 --> 14:49.970
If he doesn't give us
water and food...

14:51.048 --> 14:52.442
it  will work.

14:54.626 --> 14:56.532
We could die down here.

15:13.426 --> 15:16.220
It's covered in dust.
It must've been here for quite a while.

15:17.377 --> 15:19.852
So much for the spontaneous
road trip.

15:19.905 --> 15:22.043
This isn't a very traveled area.

15:22.156 --> 15:24.110
- Not really.
- So, the car's left in town

15:24.127 --> 15:25.752
where it would eventually
be found.

15:25.768 --> 15:27.773
- Eventually.
- Gideon,

15:28.116 --> 15:31.402
it's from the football team.
It says K.E. on the brim.

15:31.416 --> 15:32.892
- Could be Kip Engler.
- Who ?

15:32.898 --> 15:35.422
Ah, he's the quarterback.
He and brooke were an item.

15:35.485 --> 15:37.532
What, you think he had something
to do with this ?

15:37.736 --> 15:39.610
Was he at the pep rally
saturday night ?

15:39.628 --> 15:41.882
- Yeah, he was the star of it.
- Then no.

15:42.465 --> 15:45.120
But I think we know the kind
of person we're looking for.

15:45.738 --> 15:48.192
Brooke, Kelly and Polly have been
missing for 5 days.

15:48.207 --> 15:51.030
Usually in cases like this we wouldn't
expect to find them alive.

15:51.046 --> 15:53.623
However, in this case,
we don't believe that to be true.

15:53.638 --> 15:56.433
The person responsible spent
considerable time and energy

15:56.447 --> 15:57.822
planning the abduction.

15:57.836 --> 16:00.653
He did not do all this work to simply
kill the girls once he had them.

16:00.667 --> 16:02.713
Otherwise, he would've done it
at the Chamber's house.

16:02.717 --> 16:04.523
He certainly seemed to know
he had the time.

16:04.538 --> 16:06.911
And he had Kelly and Polly
reference friday

16:06.927 --> 16:09.301
in the messages they left
for their parents.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.062
We think the unsub
has something planned

16:11.068 --> 16:12.710
for the night
of your championship game.

16:12.727 --> 16:16.011
We are certain the unsub is someone
from this community.

16:16.026 --> 16:17.482
How do you know that ?

16:18.686 --> 16:20.272
Because, Mr. Chambers,

16:20.438 --> 16:23.483
he didn't have your daughter leave you
a phone message or a note, did he ?

16:23.555 --> 16:24.590
Not that I know of.

16:24.595 --> 16:26.333
'Cause he knew you'd be
out of town for a while.

16:26.345 --> 16:29.611
Just like he knew the dump site for
the car would eventually be found.

16:30.395 --> 16:31.623
Everything

16:31.787 --> 16:33.752
points to him
giving himself time.

16:33.767 --> 16:35.210
Time for what ?

16:36.885 --> 16:39.182
- I don't know yet, sir.
- Well, what's been done about it ?

16:39.195 --> 16:41.813
Sir, I'm with the FBI.
We're going to need some information.

16:41.826 --> 16:42.793
Wait a minute.

16:43.265 --> 16:44.703
If someone from this
town's taken my Brooke,

16:44.708 --> 16:47.870
- I wanna know what's being done about it.
- Yes, I know, sir.

16:47.875 --> 16:49.600
If you'd just come with me.
I will explain everything.

16:49.767 --> 16:50.972
All right ?

16:50.987 --> 16:52.372
Thank you.

16:55.407 --> 16:58.341
Predatory abductors like this unsub
are intelligent,

16:58.457 --> 17:00.932
patient and cautious.
They like to watch everything :

17:00.938 --> 17:02.992
the victims, the families,
the police.

17:03.006 --> 17:05.192
He's surely watching us now
and may even attempt

17:05.204 --> 17:07.220
to inject himself
into our investigation.

17:07.237 --> 17:09.932
We also know that predatory abductors
prepare a nest,

17:10.086 --> 17:11.861
prior to the abduction.

17:12.567 --> 17:16.221
A remote cabin,
an underground bunker,

17:16.237 --> 17:18.361
a secret secure place

17:18.727 --> 17:20.990
that only he has access to.

17:21.698 --> 17:25.002
Designed to confine
and conceal his prey

17:25.208 --> 17:27.310
once his hunting is done.

17:27.315 --> 17:29.311
Should we be looking for this nest ?

17:29.327 --> 17:31.482
You'd never find it.
For his nest,

17:31.495 --> 17:33.413
predatory abductor John Jemelske

17:33.425 --> 17:35.282
built a sophisticated
dungeon complex

17:35.297 --> 17:37.132
under a suburban syracuse home,

17:37.145 --> 17:39.341
where he documented
every detail of the torture

17:39.358 --> 17:42.612
he carried out upon the victims
he kept there for 3 years.

17:43.087 --> 17:44.692
The man who kidnapped
these girls

17:44.705 --> 17:46.892
has a relationship or a job
that permitted him

17:46.907 --> 17:48.950
to get close enough
to watch them.

17:49.348 --> 17:52.351
We must focus on those people
who had access.

17:54.048 --> 17:55.390
A family member,

17:55.406 --> 17:57.691
a teacher, a next door neighbor,
it sounds cliché

17:57.707 --> 18:00.322
but often it is the person
you least suspect.

18:00.327 --> 18:02.151
One more thing to remember.

18:02.848 --> 18:05.190
We're looking for someone
who was not at the pep rally.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.122
Ask the community,
I'm sure somebody videotaped it.

18:08.528 --> 18:11.200
You can go through the tapes,
start eliminating townspeople.

18:12.477 --> 18:15.503
I'm sorry, sir.
Mr. Chambers just took off.

18:15.517 --> 18:16.990
- Where did he go ?
- I don't know.

18:17.008 --> 18:20.193
That was Garcia. She just ran the cigarette
butts through CODIS and got a name :

18:20.507 --> 18:22.122
Donald Haas ?

18:22.138 --> 18:24.093
Don Haas is
the girls'soccer coach.

18:24.245 --> 18:26.233
Was coach Haas at the pep rally ?

18:26.536 --> 18:28.802
I don't remember seeing
him there, no.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.733
Where would coach Haas be
right now ?

18:30.938 --> 18:32.311
Now, I know

18:32.318 --> 18:35.251
we're all upset about
Polly and Brooke and Kelly,

18:35.667 --> 18:38.543
but it is important that
we keep a positive attitude.

18:38.716 --> 18:40.581
Those girls, they'd want you
to be strong.

18:41.065 --> 18:42.671
They'd want your prayers.

18:43.635 --> 18:45.832
Where's my daughter,
you son of a bitch ?

18:46.296 --> 18:49.050
I get the charges dropped,
and this is what you do for me ?

18:51.468 --> 18:53.803
- Take it easy, take it easy !
- He did it before

18:53.815 --> 18:55.010
in Pittsburgh !

18:55.018 --> 18:57.433
He was arrested, and I got him off.
I got you off,

18:57.446 --> 18:59.211
- you son of a bitch.
- That's enough !

18:59.216 --> 19:01.220
- Let's go. 
- Little help !

19:02.718 --> 19:04.022
Are you okay ?

19:08.216 --> 19:10.151
They're all turning on each other.

19:18.186 --> 19:19.951
I'm hungry.

19:23.948 --> 19:26.273
Remember when we played ashland ?

19:26.548 --> 19:29.481
You stopped like
a hundred shots on goal ?

19:29.926 --> 19:31.642
It wasn't a hundred.

19:31.656 --> 19:33.621
You were on fire that day.

19:34.626 --> 19:36.843
You're  the great player, Polly.

19:37.948 --> 19:40.623
You're the one going
to Penn state.

19:42.395 --> 19:44.522
You're going to come
visit me, right ?

19:47.747 --> 19:50.651
There's got to be a way
to get him to come down here.

19:50.696 --> 19:52.682
He's not coming down.

19:52.927 --> 19:55.082
You know, some of us
are trying to come up

19:55.087 --> 19:56.690
with solutions, Brooke.

19:56.826 --> 19:59.472
Don't.
She's sick.

19:59.767 --> 20:01.512
Sick, she's sick.

20:01.516 --> 20:03.413
What about me ?
I'm sick !

20:03.426 --> 20:06.041
I'm sick of trying to come up
with a plan while little miss Perfect

20:06.055 --> 20:08.130
over here just whines.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.720
She has a plan.

20:20.137 --> 20:23.250
- What are you talking about ?
- She already has a plan.

20:23.267 --> 20:25.273
Why hasn't she told us ?

20:30.356 --> 20:32.792
Because I'm not sick enough yet.

21:05.936 --> 21:08.072
What the hell is wrong
with Pete, huh ?

21:08.095 --> 21:10.052
Going crazy like that.

21:10.075 --> 21:11.962
Like I had something
to do with this.

21:12.268 --> 21:14.443
- Mind if I smoke ?
- Yes.

21:17.175 --> 21:19.461
You smoke more
than 100's, Mr. Haas ?

21:19.828 --> 21:20.861
Yeah.

21:21.877 --> 21:23.303
We found

21:23.468 --> 21:26.191
13 Morley 100 cigarette butts

21:26.218 --> 21:27.623
with your DNA on them

21:27.638 --> 21:30.082
across the street
from the Chamber's house.

21:32.446 --> 21:33.931
This is a mistake.

21:34.656 --> 21:36.581
Somebody has made a mistake.

21:37.098 --> 21:38.513
You smoke those cigarettes and

21:38.517 --> 21:41.141
left something for yourself
on them, sir.

21:41.158 --> 21:42.382
That's a fact.

21:42.396 --> 21:44.262
Yeah, but I did not leave
them there.

21:44.276 --> 21:46.891
- Can you tell me who did ?
- How the hell should I know ?

21:48.765 --> 21:50.773
All right, thanks.
You can go back to work now.

21:52.248 --> 21:54.782
THE SAGINAW MOTEL.

22:00.467 --> 22:03.180
- Here's the guest registry.
- All right.

22:04.088 --> 22:06.360
I'll get started running these
names through the computer.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.612
There's a name in there,
John Sherman,

22:08.636 --> 22:10.770
you're not going to find it
in the state computer.

22:10.785 --> 22:12.250
He stays here once a month,

22:12.257 --> 22:14.490
and he pays me $100 cash
over the rate

22:14.508 --> 22:16.441
so I'll look the other way.

22:16.448 --> 22:18.102
And you don't ask for I.D.?

22:18.926 --> 22:20.642
Well, I don't have to...

22:20.657 --> 22:23.743
see, because I know the guy.
Only his name's not sherman.

22:24.067 --> 22:26.821
It's Chambers.
Peter Chambers.

22:37.918 --> 22:39.913
Don Haas kidnapped my daughter.

22:39.927 --> 22:41.960
Now, why are you wasting time
talking to me ?

22:41.967 --> 22:44.213
He's being questioned
in another room.

22:45.036 --> 22:46.922
Tell me why you're so convinced
that it was him.

22:46.937 --> 22:48.623
You said it was someone
from this community.

22:48.627 --> 22:51.951
The only person I know capable of doing
something like this is Don.

22:52.185 --> 22:53.520
What do you mean, capable ?

22:53.626 --> 22:55.180
He's a sex offender.

22:55.755 --> 22:57.042
His record is clean.

22:57.057 --> 22:59.302
Yeah, well, six years ago,
Don called me from Pittsburgh,

22:59.306 --> 23:02.200
he'd been arrested for soliciting
an underage prostitute.

23:02.295 --> 23:05.021
- Why did he call you ?
- Because I'm a lawyer.

23:05.475 --> 23:08.741
We'd been friends for 30 years. We
played football together in high school.

23:10.065 --> 23:11.942
So, why did you agree
to help him ?

23:11.957 --> 23:15.413
'Cause Don swore it was a one-time thing.
The guy was going through a divorce,

23:15.426 --> 23:17.261
the girl had a record.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.662
I made sure that a sex offender
could still spend

23:19.676 --> 23:21.841
all his working hours
around young girls.

23:24.256 --> 23:26.560
God, I practically gave him
my daughter.

23:29.568 --> 23:32.240
Chambers represented Haas
in a minor sex offense case

23:32.246 --> 23:34.270
six years ago,
had the record expunged.

23:34.277 --> 23:36.761
- What kind of sex offense ?
- An underage prostitute.

23:36.776 --> 23:38.750
- Sounds like the right kind of crime ?
- Could be.

23:38.786 --> 23:41.182
Well, Haas swears he didn't put
the cigarette butts there.

23:41.448 --> 23:43.610
Does it strike anyone else
as grossly inconsistent

23:43.626 --> 23:45.881
that an unsub this
sophisticated and methodical

23:45.898 --> 23:48.300
would leave an obvious pile of his DNA
at the crime scene ?

23:48.316 --> 23:50.280
Don Haas was
at the pep rally.

23:50.347 --> 23:52.232
I saw him in two different
video tapes.

23:52.307 --> 23:54.501
I guess I must've missed him.

23:55.615 --> 23:58.200
All three of the victims'soccer jersies
were found behind the motel

23:58.217 --> 24:00.852
Peter Chambers has been staying
at for the last week.

24:06.818 --> 24:09.713
Don Haas has an alibi for the night
your daughter was taken.

24:10.717 --> 24:12.193
- What ?
- Video.

24:12.477 --> 24:15.433
At the exact time the other girls
were leaving their scripted messages,

24:15.445 --> 24:18.041
- he was at the pep rally.
- Oh, my god.

24:18.596 --> 24:21.382
You said you were in Philadelphia
on business last week.

24:22.778 --> 24:25.231
- I'm sorry ?
- Were you in philadelphia ?

24:25.548 --> 24:27.111
You think I hurt my daughter ?

24:27.127 --> 24:29.020
We just found
the girls'soccer uniforms

24:29.037 --> 24:31.101
behind the Saginaw motel.

24:32.827 --> 24:33.610
What ?

24:33.625 --> 24:36.653
Were you in Philadelphia
on business last weekend ?

24:40.506 --> 24:41.171
No.

24:41.777 --> 24:43.030
Where were you ?

24:45.366 --> 24:47.361
I was at the Saginaw motel.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.380
What were you doing there ?

24:51.418 --> 24:53.662
I meet a friend there
once a month.

24:56.267 --> 24:58.162
Actually, he's more
than a friend.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.521
This is a small town.

25:02.025 --> 25:03.992
These are small town people.

25:04.376 --> 25:06.301
They're wonderful in many ways,
but there are some things

25:06.308 --> 25:08.100
they just don't understand.

25:08.896 --> 25:10.443
I need a name.

25:11.696 --> 25:13.200
Glenn Donahue.

25:14.798 --> 25:16.981
He lives on Rittenhouse square...

25:17.817 --> 25:19.163
with his wife...

25:20.377 --> 25:22.200
and his two little boys.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.202
- These men are innocent.
- You're sure ?

25:26.278 --> 25:28.800
Unsub planted evidence
to implicate them.

25:29.006 --> 25:30.851
Forensic countermeasures.

25:30.895 --> 25:31.702
So,

25:31.716 --> 25:34.303
we've got no suspects,
no reliable evidence,

25:34.677 --> 25:35.900
we've got nothing.

25:36.207 --> 25:37.821
We have the behavior.

25:38.135 --> 25:39.893
The fact of the countermeasures.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.883
He tried to implicate
Haas and Chambers.

25:41.905 --> 25:44.860
That would mean Haas and Chambers
had significance to him, right ?

25:45.095 --> 25:48.101
Who he's implicated may be
as important as who he's abducted.

25:48.115 --> 25:49.662
He's been watching them all

25:49.676 --> 25:51.972
for a long time.

25:52.546 --> 25:53.990
Seething.

25:54.515 --> 25:57.163
We need to bring the parents
and the people he implicated in.

25:57.178 --> 25:58.832
They, along with the girls,
are his targets,

25:58.836 --> 26:01.393
and it may be the key to finding him
before it's too late.

26:10.568 --> 26:12.222
He's ahead of us.

26:13.125 --> 26:14.740
Has been all along.

26:16.696 --> 26:19.141
I got a bad feeling
about this one.

26:19.615 --> 26:20.860
Me, too.

26:23.245 --> 26:25.193
It's terrible, but she's sick,

26:25.205 --> 26:27.321
- and pretty soon we will be, too.
- I'm not listening.

26:27.345 --> 26:29.781
- She is dying already.
- What ?

26:29.797 --> 26:32.450
- You don't know that.
- Look at her, Polly.

26:32.657 --> 26:35.470
She isn't going to make it.
We have to face facts.

26:35.708 --> 26:37.720
- She's dying.
- No she's not.

26:37.728 --> 26:39.162
Yes, she is.

26:39.176 --> 26:41.100
But we don't have to.
So, what we have to do

26:41.105 --> 26:43.922
is sacrifice our friend
and we're safe.

26:43.955 --> 26:46.463
We didn't do that to her, okay ?

26:46.478 --> 26:48.452
How do you know
he'll let us go anyway ?

26:48.467 --> 26:50.710
Did you ever think of that ?
What if he's just...

26:50.726 --> 26:53.093
some evil, twisted psycho

26:53.105 --> 26:55.202
who gets off watching people
fight with each other.

26:55.205 --> 26:57.792
Maybe we can get her help
if we just get out of here.

26:57.808 --> 26:59.710
He said one of us has to die.

26:59.726 --> 27:00.743
If we don't choose,

27:00.756 --> 27:03.001
we are never going to see
our families again, ever.

27:03.257 --> 27:05.793
No one will ever know what happened
to us, that we'll starve to death

27:05.807 --> 27:07.563
and no one will ever know.

27:08.228 --> 27:10.070
You'll never see
your mother again,

27:10.337 --> 27:11.133
ever.

27:13.397 --> 27:15.673
My mom would be totally alone.

27:16.988 --> 27:19.252
- Totally.
- Totally alone.

27:23.988 --> 27:26.403
There's no other choice, is there ?

27:26.576 --> 27:29.390
No, Polly, I'm sorry,
but there is no other choice.

27:29.408 --> 27:31.533
She's going to die anyway, right ?

27:31.765 --> 27:33.720
That's right,
but we don't have to.

27:39.535 --> 27:40.711
All right.

27:42.197 --> 27:43.272
Okay.

27:47.017 --> 27:48.523
Hey, mister.

27:49.856 --> 27:51.720
We made our choice.

28:01.835 --> 28:02.750
God.

28:05.296 --> 28:06.021
No.

28:08.575 --> 28:09.951
What's happening ?

28:10.348 --> 28:11.653
Nothing, brooke.

28:11.665 --> 28:13.420
Nothing. Go back to sleep.

28:22.665 --> 28:25.600
This unsub, or unknown subject,
is someone you know.

28:25.856 --> 28:27.623
He's someone from your past,

28:27.655 --> 28:30.460
and he's someone who thinks
that you have wronged him.

28:32.597 --> 28:35.310
We'd like for you to think about
who might fit that description.

28:35.537 --> 28:37.203
Don't you think if we knew
who we did this

28:37.206 --> 28:38.980
or why we would've told you ?

28:38.995 --> 28:40.620
Please, let him talk, Gill.

28:40.647 --> 28:43.281
Oh, I'm going to take advice
from somebody on mental medication ?

28:43.548 --> 28:44.630
What ?

28:44.866 --> 28:46.823
Everyone knows, judy.

28:46.835 --> 28:49.001
Could we just stay focused, please ?

29:10.825 --> 29:12.561
The man who took your daughters.

29:12.575 --> 29:15.170
He framed Peter Chambers
and Don Haas for a reason.

29:16.568 --> 29:18.970
This is an attack... on you.

29:19.167 --> 29:21.733
I have made mistakes in my life,
but why take it out on Brooke ?

29:21.745 --> 29:23.970
You know, it's one thing for Brooke
to pay for your mistakes,

29:23.978 --> 29:25.761
but if my daughter has to pay
for them, too...

29:25.776 --> 29:28.332
- Mr. Seymour, that's not helping.
- That's not fair, Gill.

29:28.617 --> 29:29.692
Fair ?

29:29.708 --> 29:32.223
You shut the hell up,
you're nothing but a pervert.

29:32.236 --> 29:34.690
You will never get near
the children of this town again.

29:34.767 --> 29:37.392
We need to keep this
as civil as possible.

29:51.378 --> 29:54.251
Gill, are you even listening ?
It wasn't Don. He had nothing to do with it.

29:54.287 --> 29:56.093
You knew he was a deviant,
you didn't tell us.

29:56.108 --> 29:58.792
- You let him coach our girls.
- His arrest...

29:58.815 --> 30:00.860
was a misunderstanding, okay ?

30:00.886 --> 30:03.073
We talked to
the hotel manager, Peter.

30:03.425 --> 30:05.091
We know about you.

30:06.048 --> 30:08.102
Maybe this is god's punishment.

30:08.618 --> 30:09.882
Oh, punishment.

30:09.988 --> 30:11.092
Okay.

30:11.266 --> 30:14.070
At least I didn't spend the week my
daughter was missing focusing on my son

30:14.085 --> 30:16.511
- and the damn football game !
- No,

30:16.747 --> 30:19.132
we know what you spent
the week doing.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.423
I blame myself

30:33.445 --> 30:36.630
for ever letting Kelly be friends
with Brooke and Polly to begin with.

30:36.966 --> 30:39.261
Low breeding always shows through.

30:39.276 --> 30:41.690
- Low breeding ?
- They're bad seeds.

30:41.876 --> 30:44.952
- They always have been.
- Don't talk about my daughter like that,

30:44.957 --> 30:47.041
- all right ?
- That's enough !

30:48.936 --> 30:50.731
What is the matter with you people ?

30:52.018 --> 30:54.431
This is exactly what he wants.

30:54.947 --> 30:57.772
He is attacking all of you. He is
turning all of you against each other,

30:57.787 --> 31:00.300
and you're just
letting him do it.

31:02.066 --> 31:04.172
Your daughters are best friends,

31:04.866 --> 31:06.852
and you all have known each other
most of your lives

31:06.867 --> 31:08.292
as friends.

31:45.385 --> 31:47.590
Don't let this man beat you
this way.

31:54.196 --> 31:55.670
What do you want us to do ?

31:55.677 --> 31:57.283
Listen to these agents,

31:58.066 --> 32:00.592
all right ? They came here to help.
Let them do that.

32:06.745 --> 32:08.512
We're going to split you up,

32:09.126 --> 32:11.121
go over your histories,
and see if there's a name

32:11.137 --> 32:12.793
from your past in common.

32:12.828 --> 32:15.030
Probably won't be
a casual acquaintance.

32:15.707 --> 32:17.110
He knows your secrets.

32:17.445 --> 32:19.940
Don't just think people
you've knowingly wronged.

32:20.425 --> 32:22.362
Maybe something
you're not even aware of,

32:22.386 --> 32:24.171
- or you may have forgotten
- Agent Gideon.

32:24.197 --> 32:26.900
It's Penelope Garcia from Quantico.
She says it's urgent.

32:26.938 --> 32:28.143
Put her on speaker.

32:28.735 --> 32:29.881
Go ahead, Garcia.

32:29.888 --> 32:31.733
Brooke Chamber's phone
just switched back on.

32:31.745 --> 32:34.450
<i>- Tell me you got a trace.</i>
- And a location. Downtown North Mammon,

32:34.466 --> 32:36.950
within 100 meters of the intersection
of main and first.

32:36.975 --> 32:38.761
That's right outside.

32:52.848 --> 32:54.340
- Morgan.
- Yeah.

32:54.358 --> 32:56.250
Keep the parents back,
there are only two of them.

32:56.265 --> 32:57.601
What's going on ?

33:01.966 --> 33:03.190
It's okay.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.621
We're with the FBI.
Are you all right ?

33:07.228 --> 33:09.003
Polly, are you hurt ?

33:09.887 --> 33:11.271
She's bleeding.

33:11.476 --> 33:13.452
It's not her blood.

33:14.606 --> 33:16.070
Brooke.

33:17.065 --> 33:18.793
Where's Kelly Seymour ?

33:26.147 --> 33:27.961
Let me get you some more water.

33:28.108 --> 33:29.422
I'll get it.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.320
Polly,

33:35.897 --> 33:37.942
do you know
who did this to you ?

33:41.036 --> 33:42.592
Whatever happened...

33:43.325 --> 33:45.560
you're a very brave woman.

33:47.586 --> 33:50.183
Not many people can face
what you did and...

33:51.867 --> 33:53.840
make it out the other side.

33:57.056 --> 33:59.251
It wasn't Polly's fault.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.472
She didn't do anything.

34:03.717 --> 34:05.822
Nothing's happened.
I'm just getting her some water.

34:05.837 --> 34:07.860
- Is she talking ?
- Did she say where kelly is ?

34:07.877 --> 34:09.983
- We're working on it.
- Agent Jareau,

34:10.737 --> 34:13.331
when you said we all grew up together,
something struck me.

34:13.347 --> 34:15.661
- What's that ?
- We all played football together.

34:16.496 --> 34:18.692
Don, Pete, even Chief Yates.

34:18.706 --> 34:20.991
We were all on the last championship
football team.

34:21.387 --> 34:23.551
The championship game's tonight.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.502
Do you know where
Kelly Seymour is ?

34:38.056 --> 34:39.433
Where's the water ?

34:39.437 --> 34:42.452
- Hotch, do you mind if I...
- No, please.

34:51.918 --> 34:54.583
Hi, Polly.
My name is JJ.

34:55.266 --> 34:58.351
I grew up in East Allegheny,
just right up the road.

34:59.326 --> 35:02.000
I was captain of the varsity
soccer team,

35:02.016 --> 35:03.502
my senior year.

35:03.908 --> 35:06.210
It got me a scholarship
to Pittsburgh.

35:06.226 --> 35:08.122
It was a pretty good school, but

35:08.136 --> 35:10.441
it's not exactly Penn state.

35:11.598 --> 35:14.293
I know that's where you're going
because your mom told me.

35:16.868 --> 35:19.203
You know, your mom carried
a picture of you

35:19.636 --> 35:22.833
all the way up to the FBI academy
in Quantico, Virginia

35:23.245 --> 35:26.023
so that me and these agents here

35:26.227 --> 35:27.800
could help find you.

35:28.848 --> 35:30.351
And, believe me,

35:30.585 --> 35:33.342
she was not leaving
until we said we'd come.

35:35.366 --> 35:37.453
So, no matter what happened

35:37.658 --> 35:39.702
over the past 6 days...

35:41.458 --> 35:43.042
no matter what...

35:44.478 --> 35:45.700
This

35:46.707 --> 35:48.840
will all be a memory someday...

35:51.148 --> 35:53.661
but you will always

35:54.088 --> 35:56.612
have a mother
that loves you that much.

36:05.807 --> 36:08.280
I want to show
you a photograph, Polly.

36:10.385 --> 36:13.410
I want you to look at the men
in the picture

36:14.478 --> 36:17.111
and tell me if you see the man
that did this to you.

36:19.748 --> 36:20.802
Okay ?

36:22.788 --> 36:23.763
Okay.

36:30.297 --> 36:31.801
It's ok.

36:38.615 --> 36:40.730
We were so hungry...

36:42.068 --> 36:43.882
so thirsty...

36:44.745 --> 36:46.311
so cold.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.173
He wants us to do it ?

36:51.185 --> 36:53.091
If that's what it takes
to get out of this alive...

36:53.095 --> 36:55.652
- No way, I can't.
- You don't have a choice.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.423
I can't. I can't.

36:57.438 --> 37:00.570
Listen, it's like like those soccer
players who crashed in the Andes.

37:00.968 --> 37:03.240
They were starving, they had no food,
nothing to eat

37:03.258 --> 37:04.971
except for their friends
who had died.

37:04.988 --> 37:07.483
They were good people,
but they didn't have a choice.

37:07.557 --> 37:09.440
They did what they had to do.

37:32.956 --> 37:34.452
You killed her.

37:36.788 --> 37:39.142
I didn't have any choice.

37:40.137 --> 37:42.323
They had already decided to...

37:45.045 --> 37:47.371
but it wasn't Polly's fault.

37:50.166 --> 37:51.553
It was him.

37:52.406 --> 37:54.460
He said we had to choose.

37:54.976 --> 37:56.263
Who was he, brooke ?

37:56.275 --> 37:58.051
Who made you choose ?

37:58.796 --> 38:00.590
I never saw him.

38:09.376 --> 38:11.142
He made us...

38:13.705 --> 38:14.850
choose.

38:15.415 --> 38:16.951
Who did ?

38:31.196 --> 38:32.400
Good job.

38:33.106 --> 38:34.230
Hotch,

38:34.547 --> 38:36.351
it's the guy that found
the soccer jerseys.

38:36.476 --> 38:38.380
It's the garbage man.

38:43.125 --> 38:44.611
It's Marcus Younger.

38:44.626 --> 38:46.973
- Polly just ID'd him.
- He was the star of our team.

38:46.987 --> 38:49.143
Blew his knee out in the first quarter
of the championship.

38:49.158 --> 38:51.321
Lost his full-ride scholarship
to Notre Dame.

38:51.335 --> 38:53.470
- Do you know where he lives ?
- Come on.

39:10.008 --> 39:11.270
Clear !

39:12.348 --> 39:14.611
Guys. There's a storm
cellar outside.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.810
Don't move !

39:35.335 --> 39:36.781
I got him.

39:38.518 --> 39:40.213
Marcus Younger ?

39:40.828 --> 39:41.802
FBI.

39:49.487 --> 39:51.120
I never touched her.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.552
Put your hands
where I can see them.

39:56.817 --> 39:59.083
- I never hurt them.
- Get up, marcus.

39:59.338 --> 40:01.583
I never even came
into the room, Jeff.

40:01.835 --> 40:03.432
They did this.

40:03.668 --> 40:05.640
Brooke and Polly.

40:06.655 --> 40:10.070
All I did was show them
who they really are,

40:10.205 --> 40:12.561
what they were truly capable of.

40:13.318 --> 40:15.821
People pretending
to be decent.

40:17.246 --> 40:19.041
When it came down to it,

40:19.698 --> 40:21.001
they, uh...

40:22.077 --> 40:24.222
they reacted just the way
I knew they would.

40:24.236 --> 40:26.003
They turned on each other.

40:29.866 --> 40:32.141
Just like when I got hurt.

40:33.627 --> 40:36.252
You all couldn't wait
to run over me,

40:36.265 --> 40:39.421
to take my position,
to take my life...

40:41.416 --> 40:43.490
and to forget all about me.

40:45.715 --> 40:47.941
Marcus, I'm not going
to ask you again.

40:48.398 --> 40:49.750
Get up.

40:54.958 --> 40:57.070
You don't know
what it's like, Jeff.

40:57.197 --> 41:00.130
You all have lives,
and I just cleaned up after you.

41:01.905 --> 41:04.352
Now, you have to clean up
after me.

41:04.507 --> 41:07.402
- You get him out of here.
- let's go.

41:28.605 --> 41:30.331
<i>"The ultimate choice for a man,</i>

41:30.335 --> 41:33.461
<i>in as much as he is given
to transcend himself</i>

41:33.847 --> 41:36.181
<i>is to create or destroy,</i>

41:36.606 --> 41:38.833
<i>to love or to hate."</i>

41:39.327 --> 41:40.592
<i>Erich Fromm.</i>

41:42.976 --> 41:44.440
Can't sleep ?

41:45.488 --> 41:48.820
You can't imagine the pressures
a small town creates.

41:49.716 --> 41:51.490
To play, to win,

41:51.505 --> 41:54.182
everyone pushing,
everyone watching.

41:54.195 --> 41:55.540
I hated it.

41:55.557 --> 41:56.890
Why did you play ?

41:56.916 --> 41:59.830
Athletic scholarship was the only way
I was getting to college.

42:00.007 --> 42:01.783
It was my only way out.

42:03.447 --> 42:05.801
Besides, having a thick skin
when it comes to pressure,

42:05.817 --> 42:07.933
It's a good thing
in this line of work, right ?

42:07.947 --> 42:10.792
You did exceptional work
the last couple of days.

42:12.677 --> 42:13.871
Thank you.

42:14.556 --> 42:16.330
It's nice to be noticed.

42:16.508 --> 42:18.471
Yeah. We don't usually, do we ?

42:19.275 --> 42:20.571
It's all right.

42:20.577 --> 42:22.180
It's not why I do it.

42:22.195 --> 42:25.191
Have you ever thought about taking
the classes, becoming a profiler ?

42:27.218 --> 42:27.942
No.

42:28.388 --> 42:30.841
I admire what you guys do, but

42:31.186 --> 42:32.730
I like my role.

42:32.747 --> 42:36.112
I like being the person
the family can turn to.

42:36.576 --> 42:37.960
Being the voice the poor,

42:37.977 --> 42:39.703
over-worked homicide detective

42:39.708 --> 42:41.781
can call when he runs
out of leads.

42:42.137 --> 42:43.871
- Really ?
- Yeah.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.202
I thought everyone wanted
to be a profiler.

42:46.758 --> 42:47.682
Sorry.

42:50.598 --> 42:51.811
What's all of that ?

42:51.825 --> 42:53.830
New cases.

42:53.836 --> 42:56.192
I got to figure out
where going to next.

42:56.508 --> 42:59.320
Hey, wait a minute, we're the profilers.
I thought we made those decisions.

42:59.437 --> 43:00.890
Sure you do.

43:04.237 --> 43:05.791
All right. Well,

43:05.975 --> 43:07.933
I gotta find some place
to get some sleep.

43:08.118 --> 43:10.493
- Yeah, good luck with that.
- Thanks.
