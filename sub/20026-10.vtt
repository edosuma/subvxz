(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:02.208 --> 00:03.667
ROCKET: Hurry up
and get those parts
to fix the ship, Groot.

00:03.667 --> 00:05.375
We got some bounty to catch.

00:05.375 --> 00:08.375
Wow, this 20th century
technology is
really impressive.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.375
(BEEPING)

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
(THUDDING)

00:12.000 --> 00:13.208
What?

00:13.208 --> 00:15.041
Something's eating
the wires?

00:15.041 --> 00:16.208
Huh?
(SQUEAKING)

00:16.208 --> 00:17.667
Sounds like
we have an intruder.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.375
Come on. Show yourself,
you nasty little ship eater!

00:23.417 --> 00:24.625
(SQUEAKING AND MUNCHING)

00:24.625 --> 00:26.166
A rodent!

00:28.333 --> 00:30.709
You're destroying
my ship! (GRUNTS)

00:30.709 --> 00:32.208
(SHOOTING)

00:33.083 --> 00:34.500
Hmm.

00:34.500 --> 00:37.166
Oh-ho! You can't escape me,
you ugly little rat!

00:37.166 --> 00:38.250
Think you can hide?

00:38.250 --> 00:41.000
Let's do this
the old-fashioned way.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.083
(GRUNTING) Yeah!

00:44.709 --> 00:45.709
(SQUEAKING)

00:46.625 --> 00:48.125
(SHUSHING)

00:48.125 --> 00:49.250
Huh?

00:49.250 --> 00:50.333
(SHOUTS)
(SQUEAKING)

00:50.333 --> 00:51.667
(SHOOTING)

00:51.667 --> 00:53.250
Think you can outsmart me,
you little... (GRUNTS)

00:56.083 --> 00:57.250
(CRUNCHES)

00:57.250 --> 00:59.166
(ROCKET SCREAMS)
Hmm?

00:59.166 --> 01:02.792
Okay, ah!
Where are you hiding,
you little monster?

01:02.792 --> 01:04.083
Show me what you got.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.917
Just the two of us.
<i>Mano-a-mano.</i>

01:07.875 --> 01:09.000
(SQUEAKS)

01:09.000 --> 01:10.083
I got you now!

01:10.083 --> 01:12.500
(ROCKET SCREAMS)
Groot! (GRUNTS)

01:12.500 --> 01:13.667
(MUNCHING)

01:13.667 --> 01:15.166
I am Groot!

01:15.166 --> 01:16.458
(SQUEAKS)

01:20.834 --> 01:22.166
(SQUEAKING)

01:22.166 --> 01:23.500
(BEEPING)

01:23.500 --> 01:25.166
We will never
speak of this.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.333
(BEEPING CONTINUES)

01:26.333 --> 01:28.834
Mmm. I am Groot.
