WEBVTT

00:39.414 --> 00:41.750
I would like to say that...

00:42.668 --> 00:43.877
I was wrong.

00:44.795 --> 00:45.963
And...

00:47.339 --> 00:49.132
I'm very, very sorry.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.679
About what?

00:53.762 --> 00:55.263
-What do you got?
-Oh, good grief.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.140
What? Mom!

00:57.224 --> 00:59.476
It was a blanket apology.
I think that's very generous.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.770
Plus, it's retroactive.
So, enjoy.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.189
A blanket apology.
Claudia, is that even allowed?

01:04.773 --> 01:06.400
Everything is allowed here.

01:06.483 --> 01:10.153
Feel free to apologize,
scream, cry, complain, argue.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.114
Anything short of physical confrontation.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.575
-There goes my next thing.
-Did I not tell you?

01:16.326 --> 01:18.286
You've brought the room to a halt.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.038
Like it was
a Penn and Teller show before?

01:20.122 --> 01:21.289
Oh, that mouth.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.167
You were the one complaining
that I wasn't saying anything.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.753
Without my mouth, how do I speak?

01:25.836 --> 01:28.546
To quote Alanis Morissette,
"Isn't it ironic?"

01:28.631 --> 01:29.965
Do you know what that means?

01:30.048 --> 01:33.343
Claudia, let the record show,
I broke the silence here today, okay?

01:33.427 --> 01:36.388
She wasn't saying anything either.
Write that down in your scorebook.

01:36.471 --> 01:37.765
I am not keeping score.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.976
But the apology was insincere.
Put that in your scorebook, too.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.603
-She should not get points for that.
-I'm not keeping score.

01:43.687 --> 01:46.940
It's insulting to apologize
unless it's for something specific, okay?

01:47.024 --> 01:49.442
Okay, sorry. I'm sorry.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.362
Sorry.
How do I get out of this?

01:52.445 --> 01:53.781
Lorelai, listen to me.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.408
We are here today
so that Claudia can meet you

01:56.491 --> 01:58.535
and see the two of us together.
That's it.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.996
- Stop pressing.
- Okay.

02:09.546 --> 02:10.881
How much time do we have left?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.716
About 40 minutes.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.398
Psst.

02:29.775 --> 02:32.653
- How much time do we have--
- Stop asking that!

02:32.736 --> 02:35.613
Why, did I bring the deafening silence
to a halt again?

02:35.698 --> 02:39.159
Bring a watch next time, or an egg timer.
Just stop bothering her.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.285
Can I, uh, jump in here?

02:40.368 --> 02:42.162
-Please.
-You're not prisoners.

02:42.245 --> 02:44.748
Neither one of you.
And there are no rules.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.375
So talk or don't talk.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.879
Because there's a lot being said
in the silences.

02:50.963 --> 02:53.506
-What is being said?
-Is that what you're writing?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.383
-Will we see those notes?
-Who's winning?

02:55.467 --> 02:57.594
No one's winning,
and my book is confidential.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.770
If you're trying to read Claudia's watch,
I'm gonna throw you out that window.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.617
-Well, ladies, I'm afraid time's up.
-Yes!

03:20.700 --> 03:22.077
- I don't believe it.
- What?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.829
-You ran out the clock.
-So did you.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.748
Today was for you to speak, not me.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.541
I spoke. You gave me credit, right?

03:27.624 --> 03:29.001
That's not what I'm doing here.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.669
We'll just have to start over next week.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.963
-We're on for Tuesday at 10:30.
-I can't make it.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.924
-You have something more important to do?
-Just my life, Mom.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.887
I'm sorry. I didn't wanna burden you
with this, but I guess I have to.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.264
-Oh, boy.
-Your mother is in pain.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.390
A widow in pain.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.810
-That's a good place to stop.
-That's a terrible place to stop.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.897
She doesn't get to go out like that,
with the bazookas blasting.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.106
I have somebody waiting.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.191
So this is an intrusion.
Is that what you think?

03:53.275 --> 03:55.903
-My big bazookas are intruding on you?
-Mom...

03:55.986 --> 03:58.822
Doesn't it mean anything to you,
that I am this raw nerve

03:58.906 --> 04:02.075
appealing to my only child
to help me through this period?

04:04.870 --> 04:06.872
So... 10:30.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.040
10:30.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.545
Well, she used that maneuver.
Write that down.

04:22.220 --> 04:25.307
Let's start with Swedish meatballs,
then some Peruvian salchipapas

04:25.390 --> 04:27.267
and then Indonesian rice porridge.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.477
Head straight
for the Norwegian stomach pump.

04:29.561 --> 04:32.439
It all looks good.
Shoot. I have to leave in a half hour.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.775
You can't leave.
I have to leave in half an hour.

04:34.858 --> 04:37.360
-I have a plane to catch.
-I gotta get back to the diner.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.029
-Who's gonna stay with her?
-Am I four?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.697
I can watch her if you need to go,

04:40.781 --> 04:43.241
but you need to be back
in less than 45 minutes to relieve me.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.619
I have been successfully eating by myself
for five or six years now.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.288
Gypsy's over there. She can watch me.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.622
-Oh, yeah.
-That'll work.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.084
-Oh, hey, guys. How's it going?
-It's a disaster.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.878
-Some of our cuisines didn't show up.
-You got a good turnout.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.214
We advertised
an international food festival,

04:57.297 --> 05:00.717
all 195 countries represented.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.137
And a paltry 15 showed up.
Kirk, what happened?

05:04.221 --> 05:06.598
Well, Guam had a last-minute
parent-teacher conference,

05:06.681 --> 05:08.058
Kazakhstan had car trouble--

05:08.141 --> 05:11.144
I told Kazakhstan to get a ride
with Poland if that happened.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.395
Oh, does no one listen?

05:12.479 --> 05:15.773
Bangladesh's kid has an earache,
Chad has acid reflux,

05:15.858 --> 05:17.650
Brazil's niece has a soccer game,

05:17.734 --> 05:21.696
Turks and Caicos got foot fungus,
and Singapore is just being a dick.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.282
Other than that,
127 countries never got back to me.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.327
People are going to have to expand
on the cuisines they're offering.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.579
Grab your flags.
I'm calling an audible.

05:29.662 --> 05:34.126
Israel, grab some yams and crayfish.
You're also Papua New Guinea.

05:34.209 --> 05:37.670
Italy, add Slovenia, Tibet,
and the islands of Kiribati.

05:37.754 --> 05:38.755
Let's hustle, people.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.509
-I'm gonna hang out in Korea.
-I'm gonna get a cup of Kofi Annan.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.720
-That's a little international humor.
-Very little. See ya.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.432
-Ooh, this looks good. What's this?
-That's the compost heap.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.144
Oh.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.728
I'm really hungry.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.483
-How's things in the Koreas?
-Oh, and Guam and Bulgaria? Great.

05:58.566 --> 06:01.278
Move, move, move.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.196
Stop. Line up.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.573
-Oh, hello, Rory.
-Hello, Mrs. Kim.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.409
Uh, this is Mama's new choir.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.245
Fresh off the boat.
I'm getting them ready for the circuit.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.330
Now, sing.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.878
-They sound good, Mama.
-Please, they suck eggs.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.339
-Language, Mama!
-No, I mean all they do is eat.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.926
Eggs, bread, fruit.
The toilet paper they go through.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.844
I don't want to know what they do with it.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.680
Sing out, Louise Pang!

06:29.681 --> 06:31.266
Um... Hello?

06:31.349 --> 06:34.102
Rory? Sandee Martin from <i>SandeeSays</i>.
You get the basket?

06:34.186 --> 06:35.478
I did. Hi, Sandee.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.731
<i>Those muffins? The raspberry?</i>
<i>Don't you want to make love to them?</i>

06:38.815 --> 06:39.983
Multiple times, yes.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.859
When am I getting you to join my team?

06:41.944 --> 06:43.820
That's so flattering.
I don't think--

06:43.903 --> 06:47.074
No! This thing we've got here,
it doesn't end till I hear a yes.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.575
I'm just kinda busy now.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.119
<i>Of course you're busy.</i>
<i>You're Rory Gilmore.</i>

06:51.203 --> 06:53.705
<i>But I've got plans to overtake</i>
Huffington Post <i>in a year,</i>

06:53.788 --> 06:55.957
and I need your voice
at <i>SandeeSays</i> to do that.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.793
Sandee, thank you.
The site is really great.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.962
I just don't think
I can devote the time right now.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.506
<i>-I'm on my way to London--</i>
-We'll pause. Talk to you soon.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.217
Bye.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.679
Small plates, high prices.
That's just the way I roll, pal.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.765
Gypsy, whip up a quick poutine.
You're taking over Canada.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.227
Whip up a what?

07:15.310 --> 07:19.106
So we have $27 bid
on Cassie's beautiful basket.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.483
Do I hear a $28?

07:21.566 --> 07:22.943
-Hey, let's bid.
-Why?

07:23.026 --> 07:25.653
Basket bidding was part
of our early romance.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.905
Why would I want Cassie's basket?

07:27.990 --> 07:29.199
-Dirty.
-Dirty. I know.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.326
-$28!
-She doesn't want you eating her basket.

07:31.409 --> 07:32.702
I'm gonna stop talking now.

07:32.785 --> 07:36.331
We have a bid of $28.
Do I hear $29?

07:36.414 --> 07:38.625
-$29!
-You're bidding against yourself.

07:38.708 --> 07:41.044
It's for a good cause.
$30!

07:47.717 --> 07:49.552
Okay. The tambourine is scaring them.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.305
They'll get used to it.
Just like electricity at night.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.434
-Your mother is a woman of vision.
-Always.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.896
-Oh, hey, my dad's here.
-Oh, hi, Mr. Kim.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.192
-Jackson.
-Hey, Lorelai.

08:04.276 --> 08:05.652
Hey.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.737
-No Sookie?
-Oh, she wanted to come,

08:07.821 --> 08:10.407
but something started sprouting
from the steps to the backyard.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.118
She wanted to see if it was edible.
I'm not kidding.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.663
Jackson,
you're the Virgin Islands and Qatar.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.124
Burundi, I need to talk to you!

08:20.042 --> 08:23.003
-Do I want to know what that was about?
-I'd stay out of it.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.630
Okay. It's probably best.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.591
-What's the big deal?
-What's the big deal?

08:28.675 --> 08:32.012
-Do you not have eyes?
-Kirk, calm down. What is the problem?

08:32.095 --> 08:35.432
-This man is the problem.
-It's a classic Vietnamese dish.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.311
-It's pig genocide and nothing less.
-It's delicious.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.938
-Do you wanna take this inside?
-What does that mean?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.482
We're outside, sir,
so we can only take this inside.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.858
Calm down, Kirk.
Come on, man.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.445
It... it's not Phan's fault.
A pig is food.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.529
<i>Et tu,</i> Luke?

08:49.612 --> 08:52.240
But I saw you inhale a BLT
at the diner yesterday.

08:52.324 --> 08:55.368
-Yeah.
-A BLT is lettuce, tomato, and...

08:57.412 --> 08:59.372
-I'm a monster.
-Sorry, Kirk.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.249
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.375
Mmm.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.876
Mmm.

09:06.088 --> 09:09.091
I know I'm not the one
you wanted eating your basket, Cassie,

09:09.174 --> 09:10.550
but this is really good.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.562
Red and rashy.
All over my chin, all down my neck.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.981
You can't see it 'cause of the makeup.
It's this weather.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.108
Oh, one more, love.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.734
-Are you good?
-This is just water.

09:27.817 --> 09:31.113
It's like winter is Hitler
and my skin is Poland.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.449
Come April, my face is
like one of Shakespeare's first folios.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.910
-You don't have these problems, do you?
-I'm lucky.

09:37.994 --> 09:41.873
Oh, your cheeks are like two white apples.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.000
Look at her cheeks.

09:44.084 --> 09:47.629
Tell me you don't want to take
a bite out of those cheeks.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.173
- I do.
- Okay. So, uh, Naomi.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.716
-Yes.
-I was thinking

09:51.799 --> 09:54.010
maybe we could talk
about the theme of the book.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.222
That would be me.
I mean, I'm the theme, right?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.807
For sure.
But there are many ways to approach you.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.935
I'm not approachable.
Oh, it's my mother's fault.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.230
I hate my mother. Oh!

10:05.730 --> 10:07.107
Don't write that.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.484
-Don't write that.
-But I'm a writer.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.154
Sweetie, you want facts.
Facts are what you want.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.613
Well, facts are dull.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.283
-Oh, thank you.
-Well, not so much in a biography.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.994
Oh. Well, let's not do that.
A biography.

10:20.077 --> 10:22.079
Let's do something fresh.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.790
Like, uh...

10:23.873 --> 10:26.459
-Let's make it a children's book.
-A children's book?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.253
It could deal in archetypes.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.173
A whale and a rabbit.
One of them can represent me.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.840
Are you the whale or the rabbit?

10:32.924 --> 10:35.968
Mmm. I don't know.
Thoughts?

10:36.052 --> 10:41.141
Here's one. Uh, why don't we just focus
on your story for now,

10:41.224 --> 10:43.685
and we'll talk about
the whale and the rabbit later?

10:43.768 --> 10:47.314
Darling Boswell,
I do so want to be in sync with you.

10:47.397 --> 10:51.401
Oh. No, we are in sync. I swear.
I... I really believe that.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.362
Aren't these glasses gorgeous?

10:54.446 --> 10:57.574
They won't tell me where they
get them from. They're proprietary.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.868
God, I hate England.
I'm voting for Brexit.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.620
It's just a protest vote.
It'll never win.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.872
-A whale and a rabbit.
-It's not funny.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.625
-It's pretty funny.
-And she kept coming back to it,

11:07.709 --> 11:10.503
comparing the archetypes to characters
in a play by Aeschylus.

11:10.587 --> 11:14.131
You haven't lived until you've heard
a tipsy Brit pronounce Aeschylus.

11:14.216 --> 11:16.008
Aeschylus is hard
even when you're not tipsy.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.052
It was like her lips were falling off.

11:18.135 --> 11:22.098
Try convincing her that Willy Loman
is not one of the characters in Aeschylus.

11:22.181 --> 11:25.435
-Oh, well, I'm learning so much here.
-She had five martinis. Five.

11:25.518 --> 11:28.438
She got there before I did.
I don't know what she had before.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.273
I've read about this woman.
It all aligns.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.693
I did, too. Her decades
of breaking barriers and empowering women.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.987
Her drunken, naked tirade
through glassware at Harrods.

11:36.070 --> 11:39.866
Halfway through her third martini,
she asked to lick my juicy apple cheeks.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.701
Ooh, do I want to know what that means?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.995
-My brain is fried.
-Let's talk about something else.

11:44.078 --> 11:47.206
Oh, Condé Nast. Just got the message.
Pushed again.

11:48.124 --> 11:50.585
-You're kidding.
-I know I'm not their highest priority,

11:50.668 --> 11:54.297
but Condé Nast asked for this meeting.
Months ago. This came from them.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.759
Condé Nast?
Procrastinators supreme. May I?

11:57.842 --> 11:59.135
Help yourself.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.805
How you doing, Rory?
Long time, no see.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.766
It's been a very long time.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.643
I didn't know you two were still in touch.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.771
Rory was passing through town on a job,
and I begged her to have lunch.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.439
Hmm. Nothing better to do?

12:11.523 --> 12:13.608
He did beg.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.777
What about Condé Nast?
Are they dicking you around?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.696
No. Just... lots of postponements.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.658
-You want me to make a call?
-To Condé Nast?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.785
I can set a meeting, make it stick.
It's no problem.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.788
No, that's okay.
Thank you, Mr. Huntzberger.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.164
What brings you into town?

12:28.248 --> 12:32.126
She's working on a book proposal.
Co-writing with Naomi Shropshire.

12:32.210 --> 12:36.130
Naomi Shropshire?
Have some hangover medicine ready.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.882
She's a character.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.552
-But that's what makes her unique.
-Ah, I gotta go.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.887
Um, hey, the party next week
for your uncle...

12:42.970 --> 12:45.390
-Is Odette coming?
-She will be there.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.351
Gets engaged to a girl who lives
in another country. Smart girl.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.812
And Condé Nast? The offer stands.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.188
You're very nice. Thank you.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.108
I believe that's the first time
anyone's said that to me.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.568
I mean, someone...

12:56.651 --> 12:58.528
not sticking a shiv in my back.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.322
See ya.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.702
-How did this happen?
-It's okay.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.996
-He's seen us.
-As far as he knows, we're just friends.

13:08.079 --> 13:10.331
Of all the millions of restaurants,
he walks in here?

13:11.749 --> 13:12.834
What?

13:13.501 --> 13:16.629
-Eh, this is one of the family holdings.
-'Course it is.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.299
Why do you think I sprung
for the $300 bottle of wine?

13:29.809 --> 13:33.062
All the town fire hydrants
will remain red in color

13:33.145 --> 13:35.940
until the county rules
on our request to customize them

13:36.023 --> 13:39.902
based on each corner's
individual aesthetic.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.448
Now, as some of you will recall,
two months ago I announced

13:43.531 --> 13:47.494
that we will be holding the first annual
Stars Hollow Gay Pride Parade.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.246
2016 was the perfect year to hold it

13:50.329 --> 13:52.999
because it coincided
with an important date.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.210
The 70th birthday
of one Miss Liza Minnelli.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.170
That's Liza with a "Z."

13:58.254 --> 14:01.049
-We know how to spell, Taylor.
-He's always been condescending.

14:01.132 --> 14:04.260
But I have to inform you
that after exhaustive research

14:04.343 --> 14:06.971
and an informal census,
we made a surprising discovery.

14:07.054 --> 14:09.306
There just aren't enough gays
in Stars Hollow.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.601
-How is that possible?
-We have such cute houses.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.852
And antique shops.

14:12.935 --> 14:17.106
We asked for volunteers to come forward.
So far the list is miniscule.

14:17.189 --> 14:18.357
We have Donald...

14:18.441 --> 14:20.276
-Hi, everybody.
-Donald's a pro.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.820
who will be marching
with his chow chow, Sherlock.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.197
-Sherlock's gay?
-No, he's just my dog.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.409
Adele and Lois have signed up.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.160
-Adele and Lois are a couple?
-Shh.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.329
Astonishingly, that's it.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.624
I have contacted some of the mayors
of neighboring towns,

14:34.707 --> 14:37.544
to see if they would lend us
some of their gays,

14:37.627 --> 14:40.880
but, uh, so far not a one has cooperated.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.507
-Ingrates.
-Is this really happening?

14:42.590 --> 14:46.260
We lent them our riding mowers one year.
Why can't they lend us their gays?

14:46.343 --> 14:47.679
Tell that to Hank from Woodbury.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.181
Donald, ask your cute friend Cliff
to march with you.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.349
-Cliff would do it.
-Cliff is straight.

14:52.434 --> 14:53.560
Get outta here.

14:53.643 --> 14:54.894
-Donald's gay?
-Shh.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.690
-But I'm confused.
-So we're just stuck, people. Stuck.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.942
-Taylor, question.
-Yes, Gypsy?

15:01.025 --> 15:03.403
Are you sure there isn't anybody
you're leaving out?

15:03.486 --> 15:06.238
Anyone else who could march in this thing?

15:06.322 --> 15:07.782
Anyone at all?

15:12.704 --> 15:14.747
-Nope.
-Well, there you go.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.083
So, with apologies to Miss Liza Minnelli,

15:17.166 --> 15:20.878
we'll table the parade for now
and see what we come up with next year.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.129
Sorry, Donald.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.507
Oh, Cliff and I are going kayaking
that day anyway.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.426
Now, on to our last order of business...

15:26.509 --> 15:28.553
Uh, Lorelai,
maybe you can pay attention here.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.263
-This concerns you.
-You've got my full attention.

15:31.347 --> 15:35.184
I believe that bag of profiteroles has
at least part of your attention.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.895
Well, develop a creamy filling,
and I'm all yours.

15:37.979 --> 15:39.897
Now, as many of you know,

15:39.981 --> 15:44.110
a big Hollywood movie is being filmed
in our neighboring town of Woodbury.

15:44.193 --> 15:48.531
I lobbied to have the movie shot here
in Stars Hollow, but Woodbury won out.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.199
-Good.
-No, bad.

15:50.283 --> 15:54.036
Because all the big-name stars
of the movie are staying in Woodbury,

15:54.537 --> 15:57.457
but my little birds are telling me
that a bunch of B-level actors

15:57.540 --> 15:58.916
are staying at the Dragonfly.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.002
What?

16:02.754 --> 16:04.338
Yeah, so?

16:04.421 --> 16:08.593
We can't have Stars Hollow known
as a place that welcomes B-level actors.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.053
Who's staying at the Dragonfly, Taylor?

16:11.137 --> 16:14.056
-Guys, this is private information.
-Xander Sackovich.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.349
- He's there.
- Who?

16:15.432 --> 16:17.519
-Exactly.
-How did you get my guest list?

16:17.602 --> 16:19.854
-Dexter Schmid.
-Now you're making that up.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.607
-He's on the list.
-Who are your little birds?

16:22.690 --> 16:25.234
"Lydia Papadokolis,
Tara Grabowski."

16:25.317 --> 16:28.195
What does it matter
who's staying at Lorelai's place?

16:28.279 --> 16:30.490
And how is that any of your business?

16:30.573 --> 16:34.827
If you must know,
our tax base is receding. Alarmingly.

16:34.911 --> 16:38.665
And it's the tax base
that pays for gazebo upkeep,

16:38.748 --> 16:40.416
street sweeping, twinkle lights.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.711
If we want to remain
a world-class tourist destination,

16:43.795 --> 16:45.672
we cannot lower our standards.

16:45.755 --> 16:48.174
These are paying guests.
Who cares what they've done?

16:48.257 --> 16:51.010
I brought up a couple
of their credits on my phone.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.179
Sackovich did <i>Law And Order.</i>

16:53.262 --> 16:54.471
That's not very impressive.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.599
Yeah, who hasn't done the mother lode?

16:56.683 --> 17:01.854
Tara Grabowski did an independent movie
and a two-episode arc on <i>Blue Bloods.</i>

17:01.938 --> 17:02.939
Bit of a stretch.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.067
You can't call two episodes an arc.
That's misleading.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.403
And are these washouts
spending money around town?

17:09.486 --> 17:12.031
Adding to the tax base?
I'm not seeing that.

17:12.114 --> 17:16.118
-They're probably studying their lines.
-And having sex. They have a lot of sex.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.870
My little birds are telling me

17:17.954 --> 17:21.833
that the A-listers are throwing money
around Woodbury like there's no tomorrow.

17:21.916 --> 17:25.753
Matthew McConaughey buys
three newspapers a day.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.338
I like that about him.

17:27.421 --> 17:31.008
Jessica Chastain bought a full bag
of assorted toiletries

17:31.092 --> 17:33.553
and two sun dresses.
Money in the bank.

17:33.636 --> 17:37.139
Taylor, you want a surefire way
to bring in cash, open a bar.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.390
And keep it open late.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.184
It'd be a windfall.

17:40.267 --> 17:42.144
We'll open a bar over my dead body.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.897
Well then, why don't you
just start taxing the Secret Bar?

17:47.399 --> 17:49.235
-The what?
-Nothing.

17:49.318 --> 17:53.114
All right. It's getting late, people.
Let's adjourn.

17:55.575 --> 17:59.537
Lorelai, at least find out
if any of your B-listers are gay

17:59.620 --> 18:01.622
and if they're willing
to march in a parade?

18:01.706 --> 18:03.040
No, Taylor.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.042
I'm an island.

18:08.379 --> 18:10.882
-Where have you been?
-At a meeting with the accountant.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.550
Oh, that's great.
I'm sprinting around like a madman,

18:13.635 --> 18:17.013
keeping this tiny place running,
and you're off whooping it up.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.764
Whooping it up?
I barely kept my eyes open.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.600
Hold on. These are heavy.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.728
Excuse me.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.273
I know you're disappointed
that we have no exercise equipment,

18:27.356 --> 18:30.902
so I ran home and I brought you
some of my own personal dumbbells.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.988
They're pretty small.
I'm used to working with big dumbbells.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.741
Yes. So am I.

18:36.824 --> 18:40.536
-Excuse me. Lorelai!
-Ah. What?

18:40.620 --> 18:42.789
Have you looked these people up?
They are B-level.

18:42.872 --> 18:45.541
-No. Not this again.
-And the one with the skateboard?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.877
He doesn't ride it.
He just carries it around.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.086
I'm not listening to you.

18:49.170 --> 18:50.921
The girls all stand at the mirror,

18:51.005 --> 18:52.798
looking at themselves
like they're God's gift,

18:52.882 --> 18:55.760
making it impossible for me to stand
at the mirror and look at myself.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.053
-Enough.
-And the boys

18:57.136 --> 18:59.305
stare at their phones
with their mouths open.

18:59.388 --> 19:00.848
They never close them.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.350
They all have stupid
ventriloquist dummy mouths!

19:03.434 --> 19:04.686
And what is the mother lode?

19:04.769 --> 19:06.854
They keep telling stories
about the mother lode.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.441
Hey, what is the matter with you?
You've been spitting nails all week.

19:10.524 --> 19:13.986
Are you aware that the A-listers
in this movie are all staying in Woodbury?

19:14.070 --> 19:16.656
-Painfully.
-At the Cheshire Cat. The Cheshire Cat.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.033
With their watery orange juice,
scratchy towels

19:19.116 --> 19:20.660
and really stinky croissants.

19:20.743 --> 19:24.413
-Yes, we're better than the Cheshire Cat.
-We are better, but they have suites.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.500
Big, comfy suites
with soaking tubs and mini-fridges.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.585
-We hate mini-fridges.
-Of course we do.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.880
But Jack Black wants a mini-fridge.
Cate Blanchett wants a mini-fridge.

19:32.964 --> 19:35.591
It's Dexter Schmid and Lydia Papadokolis

19:35.675 --> 19:39.387
who compromise their standards and stay
in our tiny rooms without mini-fridges.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.055
Our rooms are beautiful.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.016
But no Nespresso machines.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.352
Daniel Radcliffe likes his ristretto
in the morning

19:46.435 --> 19:48.395
and his half-decaffeinato in the evening,

19:48.479 --> 19:51.398
while he reads the papers
he borrowed from Matthew McConaughey.

19:51.482 --> 19:52.524
How do you know all this?

19:52.608 --> 19:55.319
-We don't have a spa or a gym.
-We don't have the space.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.613
These people care about their pecs
and their glutes.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.366
They work them out. Then they want them
oiled, rubbed and scraped.

20:00.449 --> 20:03.077
Then they like to sit in their suites
and soak in their tub

20:03.160 --> 20:05.371
and have juice
that they kept cold in their mini-fridge.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.248
We've peaked!
Let's face it, we've peaked.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.541
-Michel...
-It's all downhill from here.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.960
Our destinies are set,

20:11.043 --> 20:13.713
and Jennifer Lawrence
is never, ever going to stay here.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.466
And what's the point of living if we are
never going to bag Jennifer Lawrence?

20:19.844 --> 20:22.304
Liz... Liz, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.348
This is a lot to digest.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.392
Say that again? Uh-huh.

20:26.475 --> 20:27.601
-You ready?
-Hit me.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.270
-My sister's joined a cult.
-Which one?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.022
I'm trying to figure that out.
Liz?

20:31.105 --> 20:33.357
Oh, hi, T.J.
Yeah, what is the cult?

20:33.440 --> 20:34.608
Uh-huh, I see.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.528
No, no, no, it makes perfect sense.
It's a vegetable cult.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.781
-Ah. One of those.
-They joined it by accident.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.574
How do you accidentally join a cult?

20:41.657 --> 20:43.409
-It's Liz and T.J.
-Grab some wine.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.411
Yeah, all right.
Talk to my brother-in-law.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.830
Hi, T.J.
Oh, hi, Liz. It's Lorelai.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.124
How do you accidentally join a cult?

20:50.207 --> 20:52.418
Uh-huh. I see.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.295
Oh, that makes perfect sense.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.964
They signed up for a co-op
that has great vegetables,

20:57.048 --> 20:58.465
filled out the paperwork, signed it,

20:58.549 --> 21:01.052
and it turned out to be a cult
that grows vegetables.

21:01.135 --> 21:03.262
-They can't get out of it?
-You can't get out of it?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.347
Got it.
Not for six million years.

21:05.431 --> 21:07.183
At least there's a cut-off date.
Here.

21:08.059 --> 21:11.020
Liz? Oh, hi, T.J.
Listen, can I call you back?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.773
I don't know, sometime before
the six million years is up?

21:13.856 --> 21:14.690
Will that work?

21:14.774 --> 21:15.941
Great. Bye.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.485
Those vegetables better be
fresh and crunchy.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.947
-I don't want to talk about it.
-Then let's not...

21:21.030 --> 21:22.573
Here, sit. Sit.

21:22.656 --> 21:26.869
Got chicken scaloppini for you,
linguine with meatballs for me...

21:26.953 --> 21:29.621
and a hanger steak for Paul Anka.

21:30.539 --> 21:33.876
-Hey, how was work?
-Crazy. By which I mean, Michel is crazy.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.462
- Ah, what else is new?
- He's been on edge lately.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.672
-He says we've peaked.
-How have you peaked?

21:38.756 --> 21:40.674
The place has been booked solid
since you opened.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.343
But it's so small. Just ten rooms

21:42.426 --> 21:44.678
and no suites, no mini-fridge
and no room to grow.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.263
-You don't need to grow.
-Tell him.

21:46.347 --> 21:49.183
Why does everything need to grow?
If something's good, keep it the same.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.228
-Yeah, but I kinda get what he's saying--
-No, you don't need more.

21:53.062 --> 21:53.896
Okay.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.983
Listen...
I don't mean to be so firm about this,

21:57.066 --> 21:59.235
but don't let a guy like Michel get
in your head, okay?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.737
He's been complaining for 20 years.
Let him complain.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.447
-I know.
-You want me to talk to him?

22:03.531 --> 22:05.866
The last time you talked to him,
he spent an hour crying.

22:05.950 --> 22:08.494
Well, something good came out of it.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.425
-Hey, check on Paul Anka.
-I'm on it.

22:34.395 --> 22:35.771
Gotta go out, poochy?

22:36.647 --> 22:37.481
Clearly.

22:38.399 --> 22:39.733
You all set, bud?

22:40.693 --> 22:43.070
All set. Squirrel!

22:43.863 --> 22:45.739
-You hungry, bud?
-When am I not?

22:50.452 --> 22:51.996
Then I fell back to sleep

22:52.079 --> 22:55.666
and the real Paul Anka serenaded me
with a medley of lullabies.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.834
-That's very sweet of him.
<i>-I know.</i>

22:57.918 --> 23:00.296
I feel weirdly bonded
with the real Paul Anka over this.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.965
It's my third dream about him this year.
What does that mean?

23:03.048 --> 23:05.009
Good thing
we didn't name him Mickey Rourke.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.094
Hey, have you ever heard of Dexter Schmid?

23:07.178 --> 23:08.887
-Is that a band?
<i>-No, an actor.</i>

23:08.971 --> 23:09.972
Don't think so.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.848
-Tawny Shaverkian?
-Nope.

23:11.933 --> 23:13.809
-Lynix Hatlestad?
-Who are these people?

23:13.893 --> 23:15.269
<i>Actors staying at the inn.</i>

23:15.352 --> 23:16.645
-Kind of B-level.
-That's mean.

23:16.729 --> 23:19.607
That's what everyone's calling them.
They bought out the whole inn.

23:19.690 --> 23:20.942
-That's good.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

23:21.025 --> 23:23.277
But we should've bagged
Jennifer Lawrence, right?

23:23.360 --> 23:24.820
Why Jennifer Lawrence?

23:24.904 --> 23:26.864
'Cause that's who you try to bag.
She's the goods.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.074
"She's the goods"?
What is that, hotel lingo?

23:29.158 --> 23:32.369
-The ones who are here are B-level kids--
-Call them something else.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.956
These younger, less-credited thespians,

23:35.039 --> 23:37.708
they all use their original names.
No one changes them anymore.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.251
<i>-What's with that?</i>
-They like them.

23:39.335 --> 23:40.962
Tawny Shaverkian likes her name?

23:41.045 --> 23:42.754
-It's not bad.
<i>-My generation,</i>

23:42.838 --> 23:45.382
we got Natalie Portman,
not Natalie Hershlag.

23:45.466 --> 23:46.717
Someone's been on Google...

23:47.217 --> 23:49.678
We got Joaquin Phoenix,
not Joaquin Bottom.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.722
-Oh, you're making that up.
<i>-No.</i>

23:51.805 --> 23:54.600
Who wants to see Virginia McMath
dance with Frederick Austerlitz?

23:54.683 --> 23:56.268
<i>-Is that Ginger and Fred?</i>
-Yeah.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.270
You sound very worked up.
Are you okay?

23:58.354 --> 24:00.022
Michel's leaving.

24:00.731 --> 24:03.067
-No, he's not.
-Well, he's getting restless.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.360
Well, that's just Michel.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.237
Play him some Skrillex.
That always calms him.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.947
The Dragonfly was a dream
Sookie and I had.

24:09.031 --> 24:10.407
It was a pals' place.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.786
<i>And then she left, which sucked,</i>
<i>but I still had Michel.</i>

24:14.286 --> 24:18.082
And Michel...
He's for me what Paris is for you.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.917
-Your angry friend.
-My angry friend.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.170
-He's not leaving.
-How much longer are you there?

24:23.253 --> 24:25.172
Not much longer. I'll see you soon.

24:25.256 --> 24:26.423
Didi's not sick of you yet?

24:27.216 --> 24:29.093
-Didi?
-British Didi?

24:29.927 --> 24:32.262
Oh, no. Um...

24:32.346 --> 24:34.390
Not sick yet. I do the dishes.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.183
Oh, for Didi you do the dishes.

24:36.892 --> 24:39.686
-I have to go.
-Thanks for letting me bend your ear.

24:39.770 --> 24:42.064
-Michel's not leaving.
-Bye.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.361
Oh, you'd look good in a suit.
Yes, you would.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.209
Well, I just wanna say...

25:03.127 --> 25:05.671
-I'm sorr--
-Do not do that again.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.759
You ever think
about putting in a salad bar?

25:14.555 --> 25:16.307
What a day!

25:16.390 --> 25:18.892
-What a beautiful day!
-He did not sound like that!

25:18.975 --> 25:21.770
Yes, we called him
Trombone Stan. He did!

25:21.853 --> 25:24.565
- I never called him that.
- Hello, Lorelai.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.318
-How've your grades been?
-Stop.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.320
Fine.
Pretty good, Stan.

25:29.403 --> 25:30.863
Pretty good's enough

25:30.946 --> 25:34.825
- for Trombone Stan.
- Really, stop! Stop!

25:38.954 --> 25:41.873
So that's it?
Trombone Stan and you're out?

25:41.957 --> 25:44.460
Not unless you want some Timpani Tom.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.795
-Are you hearing this?
-Timpani Tom.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.548
And you have nothing else to say?
No outstanding issues?

25:49.631 --> 25:51.550
Nope. I'm all good. You?

25:52.843 --> 25:55.887
As a matter of fact,
I do have a few outstanding issues.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.889
Poked the bear.
Poked the bear.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.975
A girl gets pregnant at 16

26:00.058 --> 26:03.145
and takes off without leaving
so much as a forwarding address.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.439
-Oh, my God. Hornet's nest.
-Excuse me?

26:05.522 --> 26:09.359
Mom, are we really gonna go back
over this ancient history again?

26:09.443 --> 26:12.196
-We've moved so far past this.
-Well, clearly I haven't.

26:12.279 --> 26:15.574
But that was eons ago,
and we've had so much contact since then,

26:15.657 --> 26:19.035
and you got Rory back in your life.
Why? Why are we doing this?

26:19.120 --> 26:21.747
You asked if I had issues,
and I have issues.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.125
Really, a salad bar, a Color Me Mine.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.336
Here's another one.
After years of absence,

26:27.419 --> 26:30.506
she deigns to come back into our lives
when she needs money.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.384
For Rory. It was for my daughter.
And it was a loan.

26:33.467 --> 26:35.136
Ancient history.
Issue resolved.

26:35.219 --> 26:38.054
She's hidden just about every relationship
she's ever had from me.

26:38.139 --> 26:40.015
Yes. Yes, that has been my habit.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.808
She's smarted off
in front of other family

26:41.892 --> 26:44.186
and in front of friends
too many times to count.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.272
It takes her days to return phone calls.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.273
I give her presents
and never see her using them.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.525
I have specific tastes.

26:49.608 --> 26:53.195
The maid once saw me napping,
and Lorelai told her I was bourboned up.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.322
It was a joke.
It was a joke.

26:55.406 --> 26:59.451
And never will I forgive her for that
heinous letter she sent on my birthday.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.537
Whoa. What? What letter?

27:01.620 --> 27:04.998
With the accusations, the profanity,
the abuse. The letter.

27:05.081 --> 27:06.417
Uh, that wasn't me.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.419
-Of course it was. Who else would it be?
-That definitely wasn't me.

27:09.503 --> 27:11.838
I'm not Edith Wharton.
I don't write letters.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.549
Well, that's absurd. I recall it clearly.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.884
You're not,
'cause it never happened.

27:15.968 --> 27:19.012
It was on my bed. I remember the envelope
and the color of the ink.

27:19.096 --> 27:22.099
No. Unh-unh.
Look, I will cop to the other stuff, okay?

27:22.183 --> 27:25.060
Embarrassing you in front of guests,
hiding my relationships...

27:25.144 --> 27:28.021
But I won't admit to writing
some terrible letter on your birthday,

27:28.104 --> 27:29.898
because it never happened.
It never happened.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.818
-Well, I'm saying it did.
-Ladies, I'm afraid we have to stop.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.779
-Mom, I did not write that letter.
-And I say you did.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.072
Somebody's waiting. I'm sorry.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.450
She's been holding onto this for years,
and it's not true.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.660
It's not true.
Mom, it's not true.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.037
-We'll talk about this next week.
-No, I...

27:44.120 --> 27:46.457
You can't leave this room
thinking that I did that.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.334
-I won't let you.
-Give me my purse.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.752
-We're extending our time.
-I'm afraid that's impossible.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.879
Fine! We'll...
we'll settle this next week!

27:52.963 --> 27:55.257
-Ridiculous!
-Lorelai, my purse!

27:55.341 --> 27:57.301
Lorelai, I need my keys.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.304
Naomi, you're saying
so many things at once. Slow down.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.848
<i>I'm British, Rory.</i>
<i>We speak fast. Catch up.</i>

28:02.931 --> 28:04.558
Winston Churchill didn't speak fast.

28:04.641 --> 28:08.645
Why are you talking about that fat poof
when my whole life is falling apart?

28:08.729 --> 28:12.316
You used to like my historical references.
She called Winston Churchill a fat poof.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.193
What did he do
other than save the world?

28:14.276 --> 28:15.319
Who are you talking to?

28:15.402 --> 28:17.696
-No one.
<i>-Were you listening before?</i>

28:17.779 --> 28:20.491
George is not returning my calls.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.911
<i>-He's not following my tweets.</i>
-I thought your boyfriend was Colin.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.787
Oh, for the love of God.
That was weeks ago.

28:25.871 --> 28:28.039
You Americans really don't listen.

28:28.123 --> 28:31.084
-No, I listen--
<i>-I am on a ledge here.</i>

28:31.168 --> 28:33.545
- Uh, wait, are you literally on a ledge?
- What?

28:33.629 --> 28:37.382
You see, I don't think
you have the humor to do this book.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.967
You don't get nuance.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.469
No, I get nuance.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.764
And you flat out dismissed
my whale and mouse story.

28:43.847 --> 28:44.848
No, I didn't.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.017
-And it was a rabbit, not a mouse.
<i>-No.</i>

28:47.100 --> 28:48.227
It was a mouse.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.478
-A rabbit.
<i>-A mouse.</i>

28:49.561 --> 28:50.646
It was a rabbit.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.356
It's the gentile <i>Fiddler On The Roof.</i>

28:52.439 --> 28:55.484
Okay. You're right. It was a mouse.
And you're the mouse.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.903
<i>No. No, darling. No.</i>

28:57.986 --> 29:01.323
I'm the whale.
Why in God's name would I be a mouse?

29:01.407 --> 29:05.076
-I must be mistaken.
-I can't possibly sit with you today.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.578
Okay, can we talk tomorrow?

29:06.662 --> 29:10.666
You say that
as if there is a tomorrow.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.670
The suspense is killing me.
Is she the mouse or the whale?

29:14.753 --> 29:15.754
It doesn't matter.

29:15.837 --> 29:18.548
Next time she'll be a mongoose,
a pangolin or a fruit.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.133
It'll be my fault for not remembering.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.510
What did you think?

29:21.593 --> 29:22.886
<i>SandeeSays</i>?

29:22.969 --> 29:25.597
Layout's pretty good.
Design catches your eye.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.433
And attacks it with pretty, pretty colors.

29:27.516 --> 29:29.310
It's an interesting mix of sweet and sour.

29:29.393 --> 29:32.062
Gets a little catty and gossipy.
But not that I don't like gossip.

29:32.145 --> 29:35.441
How many steps down is it
from the <i>New Yorker,</i> or <i>GQ,</i>

29:35.524 --> 29:37.651
or <i>Huffington</i> or <i>Bazooka Comics?</i>

29:37.734 --> 29:39.528
A few below the first three.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.488
But I love that they want you.

29:41.572 --> 29:44.157
Could mean they're looking
to class the joint up a bit.

29:45.826 --> 29:48.203
-I gotta get going.
-Mmm, but you're my pillow.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.871
Sorry.

29:52.248 --> 29:54.668
-What time is your flight tomorrow?
-Threeish.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.086
But, hey, I was thinking,

29:56.169 --> 29:58.297
I don't have to head back
to the States so soon.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.091
-Yeah?
-Yeah, there's nothing pressing.

30:01.174 --> 30:04.845
I could hang a couple more days.

30:04.928 --> 30:06.179
Are you leaving town?

30:09.182 --> 30:12.018
-Someone's coming to town?
-Kind of.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.604
-Odette.
-Kind of.

30:15.731 --> 30:18.400
Right, so I guess I'll go.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.276
Ivy tonight?

30:21.069 --> 30:23.363
-Our traditional farewell meal.
-I'll send the car at 8:00.

30:23.447 --> 30:24.781
Eight is great.

30:29.453 --> 30:32.205
- What is this movie?
- It's a weird one.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.500
Kind of scary.
You'll have to hold me.

30:34.583 --> 30:36.001
Oh, I can live with that.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.466
Hi, guys.

30:42.549 --> 30:43.550
-Hi, Lulu.
-Hey, Lulu.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.552
So do you guys want
the love couch tonight?

30:45.636 --> 30:48.764
The love couch?
Definitely.

30:48.847 --> 30:52.267
Kirk and I have had
some crazy good times on this thing.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.185
- Too late.
- Oops.

30:54.269 --> 30:55.521
Have fun.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.733
Welcome, everyone, to the spring season

30:59.816 --> 31:01.943
of the Black, White and Read
Movie Theater.

31:02.027 --> 31:06.114
I am pleased to present
tonight's feature film, <i>Eraserhead.</i>

31:07.699 --> 31:09.159
Now before we start,

31:09.242 --> 31:11.787
the management of the theater is aware
that some of you

31:11.870 --> 31:13.538
have snuck food into the theater.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.666
You should know that consuming food
purchased outside of the premises

31:16.750 --> 31:18.544
- is strictly prohibited.
- Got it.

31:23.548 --> 31:26.468
- Would it be possible to be more discreet?
- No problem.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.555
We got some extra link sausages
if anybody wants some.

31:29.638 --> 31:32.432
Babette, did you hear what I said
about food purchased outside?

31:32.516 --> 31:34.560
I didn't purchase this.
I brought it from home.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.062
- Yeah, chill out, man.
- Hey. Hey, Kirk.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.564
What is it, Pete?
Talk to me.

31:38.647 --> 31:41.274
I've seen <i>Eraserhead,</i>
like, 27 times.

31:41.357 --> 31:44.235
-Twenty-two times for us.
-It was our make-out movie.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.405
-Luke, how many times have you seen it?
-Oh, hundreds.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.740
It makes your head
leave your body, doesn't it?

31:48.824 --> 31:51.827
Yeah, my head and I
take off and float around and...

31:51.910 --> 31:54.120
look at the stars,
and take a left on Peach Street...

31:54.204 --> 31:55.330
-Get me out of this.
-Fries?

31:55.414 --> 31:56.456
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

31:56.540 --> 31:59.460
Okay. Now people,
I have a surprise for you.

31:59.543 --> 32:03.422
Twelve years ago, I completed
my first short film, <i>I Love Your Daughter.</i>

32:03.505 --> 32:06.550
It premiered at
the Lake Chappapaqua Film Festival,

32:06.633 --> 32:11.054
where it won the coveted Good Try award.

32:11.137 --> 32:14.265
Tonight, after years of labor,

32:14.349 --> 32:19.062
I am happy to announce
that my second short is finally complete.

32:19.980 --> 32:20.981
Roll it.

32:34.578 --> 32:37.247
<i>Gorgeous day, don't you think?</i>

32:41.001 --> 32:42.669
<i>This pig is for reals.</i>

32:45.506 --> 32:47.549
-Hey. That's my car.
-That's our house.

32:47.633 --> 32:48.634
Hey, that's me!

32:49.217 --> 32:51.427
How did you not notice this?

32:57.893 --> 33:00.937
<i>Kirk.</i>

33:01.605 --> 33:02.981
It's an omen.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.610
Petal, no!

33:08.403 --> 33:09.530
Poor Petal!

33:18.371 --> 33:21.082
Petal. Come on, old buddy.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.713
Why won't anybody help me?

33:27.756 --> 33:30.175
Is the world so cold?

33:31.510 --> 33:33.261
Geez. Come on, people.

33:33.344 --> 33:34.721
Not mine.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.640
-Not mine.
-Uh, Luke?

33:36.723 --> 33:37.766
What?

33:37.849 --> 33:40.936
Oh, shoot.
Why is this ringing?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.979
-Someone's calling.
-Nobody calls me at night.

33:43.063 --> 33:46.191
Come on, Luke,
turn off your cell. It's distracting.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.359
-That enough, baby?
-That ought to do it.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.904
-Who do we know in the 8-6-0?
-My mother.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.447
- My mother!
- Your mother?

33:52.531 --> 33:54.240
-That's my mother.
-Why is she calling me?

33:54.324 --> 33:55.951
-I don't know.
-She never calls me.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.494
-Don't pick up.
-I'm not picking up.

33:57.578 --> 34:00.330
Why is this ringing so much?

34:00.413 --> 34:03.041
Because that's the same phone
Alexander Graham Bell yelled,

34:03.124 --> 34:04.876
"Watson, come here. I want you," into.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.556
She left a message.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.140
Here.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.064
-What? No.
-What? What?

34:26.147 --> 34:27.774
-That's not happening.
-What?

34:27.858 --> 34:30.110
She wants you to come over
for dinner next week.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.486
-Me?
-Yes.

34:31.570 --> 34:32.821
-Just me?
-Just you.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.239
That's not happening.

34:35.323 --> 34:37.909
She has an urgent matter
she needs to discuss with you.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.578
-What is it?
-I don't know.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.913
-How did she get my number?
-I don't know.

34:41.997 --> 34:43.624
-Why?
-Why?

34:43.707 --> 34:46.793
Why?

34:48.503 --> 34:50.380
We should probably paint that out.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.423
-I guess I gotta go, right?
-You're not going.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.218
It's your mother.
She'll hound me until I do.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.887
-If you're going, I'm going.
-Yeah...

34:56.970 --> 35:00.849
-Okay, how about you go and I don't go?
-Well, frankly, she asked for you.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.892
Let's never go into battle together.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.735
I know exactly how that pig feels.

35:20.285 --> 35:23.163
Hey, was Michel in today?
Did I miss him?

35:23.246 --> 35:26.291
It said on the schedule he's on vacation.
New York, I think.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.543
Right. A lot of hotels in New York.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.796
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

35:38.178 --> 35:39.220
Hey, Rachael.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.682
-Lorelai, hey!
-How's it going?

35:41.765 --> 35:44.600
Oh, it's great.
I love this kitchen.

35:44.685 --> 35:47.395
-Mmm.
-Sookie set it up so great.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.105
Yeah, she's a pip.

35:49.189 --> 35:53.193
You know, I got soup and sammies
for days in here.

35:54.444 --> 35:57.363
-Try one. They're delish.
-Well, if they're delish...

35:58.281 --> 35:59.324
You seem sad.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.785
-Oh, he's gonna leave.
-Who?

36:01.868 --> 36:03.286
Michel.
Have you met him yet?

36:03.369 --> 36:06.622
Oh yeah.
I couldn't understand a word he said.

36:06.707 --> 36:09.668
-That's him.
-So, he's gonna leave. Why?

36:09.751 --> 36:12.671
Because it's not enough.
I get it. I've known him a long time.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.589
-Mmm.
-I was a maid first at this other inn,

36:14.673 --> 36:15.966
and I got promoted.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.468
On my first day,
he was the only one who would tell me

36:18.551 --> 36:21.096
I had a weird stain
on my Thompson Twins T-shirt and,

36:21.179 --> 36:23.181
by the way, I shouldn't be
wearing a T-shirt

36:23.264 --> 36:24.683
now that I'm working the front desk.

36:24.766 --> 36:27.894
-And you understood all that?
-He always had my back.

36:27.978 --> 36:31.356
Maybe you're reading this wrong.
Maybe he doesn't want to leave,

36:31.439 --> 36:33.316
and you're making yourself crazy
for nothing.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.068
That would be nice.

36:35.151 --> 36:38.196
Life has a way of just sort of
working itself out.

36:38.279 --> 36:42.033
Yeah, you're right.
I should just chill.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.451
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.287
You're welcome. Anything else?

36:46.371 --> 36:48.498
-Yeah, I have to let you go.
-What?

36:48.581 --> 36:51.084
The pop-up's not working out.
No one's eating anything.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.877
But they're not eating anything
out there

36:52.961 --> 36:56.131
because they have to take
their clothes off for that movie tomorrow.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.716
Sorry.

36:59.092 --> 37:02.929
Okay, uh, I guess
I'll just clean up a little and I'll go.

37:03.513 --> 37:04.639
Take your time.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.518
Mmm, really good sammie.

37:10.436 --> 37:14.315
Okay. This is the spot
to breathe deeply.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.567
You may not get another chance.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.986
- Oh, God.
- What?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.320
-What?
-I swallowed a bug.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.572
-Oh. Well...
-It's lodged in there.

37:21.656 --> 37:25.285
-Oh no. Well, okay. Let's do this.
-Okay. Let's do it.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.452
Okay.

37:27.453 --> 37:28.955
Berta! Hi!
We've met.

37:29.039 --> 37:30.123
<i>-Hola,</i> hello.
-Hello.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.499
What are you doing here?

37:32.167 --> 37:34.961
-We're here for dinner.
-But you weren't invited.

37:35.045 --> 37:37.964
Mom, you left a message about dinner.
So here we are.

37:38.048 --> 37:40.050
You weren't invited.
Hello, Luke.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.342
Hello, Mrs. Gilmore.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.969
You weren't invited.

37:43.053 --> 37:45.388
Really, Mom,
work on your hosting skills a little.

37:45.471 --> 37:47.307
Well, you're here now.

37:47.390 --> 37:49.642
See? A warm welcome
makes all the difference.

37:49.725 --> 37:52.103
Come in, I guess.
I wasn't expecting both of you.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.897
-I sent three e-mails.
-I didn't get them.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.817
-Well, I sent them.
-I don't understand e-mail.

37:56.900 --> 37:57.984
What's this?

37:58.068 --> 38:00.070
Berta's second cousins
are fixing my curtains.

38:00.153 --> 38:02.238
So much talent.
Luke, you want a drink?

38:02.322 --> 38:04.407
Yes, please.

38:04.491 --> 38:07.076
- What's wrong with your throat?
- I swallowed a bug.

38:07.577 --> 38:09.079
Why would you do that?

38:09.162 --> 38:10.914
How about scotch?
Feels like a scotch night.

38:10.997 --> 38:11.915
Coming up.

38:11.998 --> 38:14.334
Oh, now who's that?

38:16.502 --> 38:19.047
- I'm not gonna make it.
- Luke, come on.

38:19.130 --> 38:23.093
Remember your last name. Danes.
The Anglo-Saxon word for warrior.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.553
It means that you're a fighter.
You're a conqueror!

38:25.636 --> 38:28.098
No, it doesn't.
"Danes" means, like, valley, or something.

38:28.181 --> 38:30.141
It's a farmer's name.
My ancestors raised sheep.

38:30.225 --> 38:33.019
Well, they defended those sheep
with all they had.

38:33.103 --> 38:36.106
Hail to the Danes,
brave soldiers of the sheep!

38:37.023 --> 38:38.900
- Hey, kid!
- Hi, guys.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.194
-She wasn't invited.
-Ah, this again?

38:41.277 --> 38:43.654
Grandma, you forgot.
You said I could stay the night.

38:43.738 --> 38:47.367
- I'm heading to Chilton in the morning.
- Your Chilton alumni event.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.535
Of course. I forgot.
You can stay.

38:49.619 --> 38:50.954
Jury's still out on me?

38:51.037 --> 38:52.788
You said it. I didn't.

38:53.873 --> 38:55.291
Hi, Grandpa.

38:55.708 --> 38:58.002
Grandma, are my boxes still
in the guest room?

38:58.086 --> 39:01.047
-Some. I gave a bunch of them to Berta.
-What?

39:01.130 --> 39:03.299
I thought you said
you don't wear that stuff anymore.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.969
Grandma, my lucky outfit could be
in one of those boxes.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.096
Well, don't worry.
She keeps everything.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.014
Just go through her closet.
She won't mind.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.391
Thank you.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.810
-Bring yours into the study.
-Okay.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.105
Just me and Luke.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.191
Protect those sheep.
Defend those sheep!

39:25.405 --> 39:26.531
Sit.

39:28.783 --> 39:32.287
-You ever been in here?
-Once. It's, uh, woody.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.540
You can still smell Richard's cigars.
I like that smell.

39:35.623 --> 39:36.791
It's a good smell.

39:37.750 --> 39:38.960
Do you have a will?

39:39.044 --> 39:41.296
-A will?
-A will. You need a will.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.090
If you go first
and your affairs aren't in order,

39:44.173 --> 39:46.926
it all comes crashing down
on my daughter's head. Do you want that?

39:47.010 --> 39:48.553
-No.
-Do you know when you will die?

39:48.636 --> 39:49.679
Not offhand.

39:49.762 --> 39:53.599
Richard had an actuarial life table
for all the family members, including you.

39:53.683 --> 39:55.851
A prediction of everybody's day of death.

39:55.936 --> 39:58.104
It's remarkably accurate.

39:58.188 --> 40:00.856
He included some close friends, too.

40:00.941 --> 40:04.610
He nailed Stuart Carrington's death
within an hour.

40:04.694 --> 40:06.071
He was so proud of that.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.780
That's a great accomplishment.

40:07.863 --> 40:10.116
-This is your file.
-I've got a file?

40:10.200 --> 40:12.368
-You got some time left.
-Well, good.

40:12.452 --> 40:15.580
You're to use this information
for your life insurance needs.

40:15.663 --> 40:18.499
Again, you can't leave
my daughter high and dry.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.876
I'll photocopy it for you,
and you can go from there.

40:20.961 --> 40:24.255
-I'll... mark the date in my calendar.
-Good.

40:24.965 --> 40:26.507
Now, next piece of business.

40:27.758 --> 40:30.053
Richard left you a sum
of money in his will.

40:31.971 --> 40:34.057
-You didn't know that.
-No.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.350
The money's in a trust account,

40:35.433 --> 40:38.603
to be used for a specific purpose
and for that purpose only.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.687
Which is?

40:39.770 --> 40:42.523
To expand and franchise Luke's Diner.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.816
What?

40:43.899 --> 40:46.694
He even refers to it
as the Luke's Diner Empire.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.404
So that's it.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.156
You're to use the money
to build an empire.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.324
Uh--

40:51.407 --> 40:54.911
I've already contacted the best commercial
real estate agent in Connecticut.

40:54.995 --> 40:57.497
Ida Friedman. She's a real shark.

40:57.580 --> 40:59.165
She eats real estate lawyers for lunch.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.628
-You look stunned.
-Well, this is a lot to take in.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.880
Luke, when are you going to get moving?

41:05.964 --> 41:08.008
When are you going to embrace your future?

41:08.674 --> 41:09.675
Tonight?

41:10.510 --> 41:11.511
Good answer.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.680
-Need a refresh?
-Mom, where's Luke?

41:14.764 --> 41:17.142
-He was right behind me.
-I'm right here.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.310
I need to check on dinner,
set some extra plates.

41:19.394 --> 41:22.605
If you see Berta's sister Isabella,
ask her to fill the water glasses?

41:24.315 --> 41:25.775
-Well?
-I'm starting an empire.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.318
-What?
-That word was in there.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.904
-Bold letters, all caps. "Empire."
-What are you talking about?

41:29.988 --> 41:31.531
She wants me to franchise Luke's.

41:31.614 --> 41:34.117
Actually, your father
wants me to franchise Luke's.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.827
-What?
-Richard put money in a trust account.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.913
I'm supposed to call Ida
and franchise the diner.

41:38.997 --> 41:41.416
-I'm sweating through everything now.
-Not gonna happen.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.709
-I've got a shark.
-Give me that.

41:43.793 --> 41:46.337
Not gonna happen. Trust me.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.733
Say, I believe I recognize you
from my school days.

42:07.817 --> 42:10.361
And I you.
Good to see you, old chum.

42:12.155 --> 42:13.948
Ah, Chilton.

42:14.032 --> 42:17.785
"I cannot remember the books I've read
any more than the meals I have eaten;

42:17.868 --> 42:20.455
even so, they have made me."

42:27.878 --> 42:30.673
-Oh, my God. Were we ever this young?
-Never.

42:30.756 --> 42:34.469
Oh, hey, it's Mr. Sanders from AP Physics.
Hey, Mr. Sanders!

42:34.552 --> 42:35.845
Oh, no.

42:36.721 --> 42:38.389
What's up his ass?

42:38.473 --> 42:40.600
There they are.
Two of our finest.

42:40.683 --> 42:41.934
How are you, Rory?

42:42.017 --> 42:44.019
Very well.
Good to see you, Headmaster Charleston.

42:44.104 --> 42:47.898
Paris, you're looking well,
prosperous... happy?

42:47.982 --> 42:49.484
How old is that drinking fountain?

42:49.567 --> 42:52.570
I don't know.
Twenty years, maybe more.

42:52.653 --> 42:55.656
A drinking fountain
contains more rotavirus than a toilet.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.283
This is the first I've heard of it.

42:57.366 --> 42:59.952
Chipped in $100,000
to the capital improvement plan.

43:00.035 --> 43:01.662
Where are the capital improvements?

43:01.746 --> 43:05.125
Your money was well spent, Paris,
and appreciated.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.377
Come, come, we have some time.
Sit with me.

43:18.888 --> 43:21.349
I could have coffee made if you want.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.476
-Espresso? Cappuccino?
-I'm fine.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.727
Nice machine, though.

43:24.810 --> 43:28.606
-Real nice. May I ask--
-I paid for it myself, Paris.

43:28.689 --> 43:30.608
That wasn't necessarily my question.

43:30.691 --> 43:32.652
-Can I use your john?
-Uh, of course.

43:36.864 --> 43:39.242
There is no one quite like Paris Geller.

43:39.325 --> 43:42.662
-Agreed.
-So let's talk about you.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.289
-Are you married?
-Not yet.

43:44.372 --> 43:45.956
Good, be picky.

43:46.040 --> 43:48.626
-And where is home?
-Oh, here and there.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.253
A wayfarer.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.255
I read your <i>New Yorker</i> piece.

43:52.338 --> 43:55.258
I just stumbled on it one day.
Such a nice surprise.

43:55.341 --> 43:56.884
I've gotten a lot of good feedback.

43:56.967 --> 44:00.555
I've read of lot of your work.
<i>Slate,</i> the <i>Atlantic.</i>

44:00.638 --> 44:02.432
I always enjoy it.

44:02.515 --> 44:05.310
-Are things going well in your career?
-Well enough.

44:05.393 --> 44:07.812
I'm sorry about your grandfather.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.897
He was a friend. I miss him.

44:09.980 --> 44:11.065
Me, too.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.943
A lava stone counter.

44:14.026 --> 44:17.112
-French, right?
-It was there before me, Paris.

44:17.197 --> 44:19.449
-I believe you.
-Sorry, I have to take this.

44:19.532 --> 44:21.617
-Oh, please don't.
-I'll be right back.

44:23.869 --> 44:28.374
So, when was the last time someone
audited your books?

44:29.417 --> 44:30.668
- Hey, you.
<i>- Hey.</i>

44:30.751 --> 44:33.504
I had a moment. I thought I'd check in.
How's my little alumnus doing?

44:33.588 --> 44:36.048
Great.
It's fun being back here, and weird.

44:36.131 --> 44:38.218
-The headmaster says hi.
-No, he doesn't.

44:38.301 --> 44:40.761
Aren't you supposed to be
in a therapy session with grandma?

44:40.845 --> 44:43.848
-Yeah, but we took a break.
-You're not supposed to take a break.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.350
The therapist wanted the break.

44:45.433 --> 44:49.103
Oh, gotta go. Bye, hon.

44:51.146 --> 44:52.398
You smoke?

44:52.482 --> 44:54.650
Uh, I just started again.

44:54.734 --> 44:55.776
Who was that? Luke?

44:55.860 --> 44:58.821
No, it was Rory.
She's doing her Chilton day.

44:59.363 --> 45:01.157
We were just talking about Luke.

45:01.241 --> 45:03.409
-You and Claudia?
-He's your guy, right?

45:03.493 --> 45:05.370
Yeah, he's my guy.

45:05.453 --> 45:07.247
-What?
-I said nothing.

45:07.330 --> 45:09.123
-You said plenty.
-I didn't say anything.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.207
Did I say anything?

45:10.791 --> 45:13.961
Oh, but you want to, Mom.
Go ahead, get it out.

45:14.045 --> 45:16.797
It's in there, I know it is.
Pressure's building, steam is rising.

45:16.881 --> 45:20.092
- She's not married, you know.
- There she blows, Old Faithful.

45:20.175 --> 45:21.886
Stop by the gift shop on your way out.

45:21.969 --> 45:24.597
-She has "a roommate."
-Hear the quotes? He's not my roommate.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.349
-You share a bedroom.
-Yes.

45:26.432 --> 45:29.602
Which makes you roommates with benefits.
Booty buddies.

45:29.685 --> 45:32.229
That's what we are, Mom.
Glad you're up on the lingo.

45:32.313 --> 45:34.273
Anything more permanent would terrify her.

45:34.357 --> 45:36.317
We are permanent. We're permanent.

45:36.401 --> 45:39.111
Hanging out is not permanent.
Marriage is permanent.

45:39.194 --> 45:40.571
"Marriage is permanent."

45:40.655 --> 45:43.198
Uh, Liz Taylor just rose
from her grave to say, "What?"

45:43.283 --> 45:45.701
Well, even Claudia
just called him "your guy,"

45:45.785 --> 45:47.370
like it's a beach blanket movie.

45:47.453 --> 45:49.664
We have been together,
steadily, for nine years.

45:49.747 --> 45:51.832
Luke hardly ever comes by the house
for dinner.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.959
I didn't have his number
until I got it from Rory.

45:54.043 --> 45:56.211
You go through me to get to him.
The system works.

45:56.295 --> 45:58.381
You've hardly even mentioned him
in these sessions.

45:58.464 --> 46:01.133
We are here to work out problems.
Luke and I don't have a problem.

46:01.216 --> 46:03.344
My late husband
was just as concerned about this.

46:03.428 --> 46:06.431
-Interesting.
-Chalk it up to a serious lack of hobbies.

46:06.514 --> 46:09.141
That's why he set up that trust for Luke
to expand his business,

46:09.225 --> 46:10.810
to give her something more permanent.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.646
-You don't know what Dad was thinking.
-Excuse me?

46:13.729 --> 46:17.232
I was his wife for 50 years.
I knew his every thought.

46:17.316 --> 46:19.318
We shared everything
because we were married.

46:19.402 --> 46:21.654
That bond got us
through the tough times, too.

46:21.737 --> 46:22.863
The separation.

46:22.947 --> 46:26.951
Our marriage brought us back together
for some of our happiest years.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.786
What will get you through
the tough times?

46:28.869 --> 46:31.121
My Wonder Woman stamina
and a box of Twinkies.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.458
You'll just find another roommate.
Why not?

46:33.541 --> 46:34.917
Can I bum a smoke?

46:35.001 --> 46:36.794
One of you will shrug and think,

46:36.877 --> 46:39.755
"What the hell, I'm outta here,"
pack a bag and walk off,

46:39.839 --> 46:43.008
and the other'll stay behind
and just rent space to the next person,

46:43.092 --> 46:44.510
-like it's an Airbnb.
-Okay.

46:44.594 --> 46:47.638
I have not walked out
of any of these sessions,

46:47.722 --> 46:51.266
because it's super dramatic, but I think
in this moment, it is justified,

46:51.351 --> 46:53.102
'cause I don't wanna listen
to this anymore.

46:53.185 --> 46:55.730
-Our time is up anyway.
-What? Oh, no way!

46:55.813 --> 46:56.939
It is. The hour's up.

46:57.022 --> 47:00.192
Okay, well, I am walking out of here

47:00.275 --> 47:02.945
as if it is not over yet,
so the intent is the same.

47:03.028 --> 47:05.280
-Fine.
-We're picking this up next week.

47:05.365 --> 47:07.367
-Fine.
-Tuesday, 10:30. I insist.

47:11.370 --> 47:14.749
Well, he needs to sign
the sperm donation agreement today, okay?

47:14.832 --> 47:17.710
Then I don't want his sperm.
No, I do not want his sperm.

47:17.793 --> 47:21.922
I do not wanna touch or see his sperm
until I get a firm sperm agreement.

47:22.006 --> 47:23.716
We got it. No sperm.
Wrap it up.

47:23.799 --> 47:26.093
Gotta go.
I'm offline for 30. I'll check in later.

47:26.176 --> 47:28.178
-See you afterwards?
-See you afterwards.

47:30.723 --> 47:33.017
We all have our proclivities, right?

47:33.100 --> 47:36.521
The things we loved before Chilton,
the subjects we wanted to study.

47:36.604 --> 47:40.190
I had them. Literature, history.
And I absorbed them.

47:40.274 --> 47:44.570
But with time, I discovered
that it's the stealth subjects,

47:44.654 --> 47:48.991
the ones I discovered while I was here,
that really expanded my mind the most.

47:49.075 --> 47:51.702
I love music. So I thought,
"I'll take a music course.

47:51.786 --> 47:54.204
Composition and theory.
How hard could it be?"

47:54.288 --> 47:55.498
Well...

47:55.581 --> 47:59.293
It was a struggle. Let's put it that way.

47:59.376 --> 48:01.796
I had this notion that somehow

48:01.879 --> 48:04.840
my extensive familiarity
with Nick Cave, and Radiohead,

48:04.924 --> 48:08.594
and a smattering of Stravinsky
destined me for success.

48:08.678 --> 48:11.013
So I'll never forget the day
that I realized

48:11.096 --> 48:13.599
my composition class required composing.

48:14.850 --> 48:18.438
But I did it. I composed the melody,
I added the harmonies,

48:18.521 --> 48:20.606
I drew those treble and bass clefs,

48:20.690 --> 48:22.692
I wrote those whole notes,
those half notes,

48:22.775 --> 48:25.236
those quarter notes, those rest stops,
and...

48:25.319 --> 48:29.448
while you'll never witness
a public performance of my composition...

48:30.366 --> 48:34.078
because of that experience,
I can see music when I hear it.

48:34.995 --> 48:36.413
I only ever heard it before.

48:37.498 --> 48:39.375
And I'll always be grateful for that.

48:39.792 --> 48:41.752
<i>It's kill or be killed.</i>

48:41.836 --> 48:44.046
I'm not talking <i>The Art of War.</i>

48:44.129 --> 48:45.172
Oh, no.

48:45.255 --> 48:47.049
That's a tiptoe through the tulips

48:47.132 --> 48:50.135
compared with what you're going to find
beyond these walls.

48:50.219 --> 48:54.432
Betrayal, deception...
And that's just in the bedroom.

48:55.725 --> 48:58.060
That was a joke.
You were supposed to laugh.

49:00.395 --> 49:02.898
Now, I'm not in the habit
of quoting Joseph Stalin.

49:02.982 --> 49:05.192
I mean, the man was a psychopath,

49:05.275 --> 49:09.697
and his policy of forced collectivization
killed millions of his own people.

49:09.780 --> 49:13.367
But I found one thing he said
to be quite inspiring.

49:17.162 --> 49:19.957
Well, hey, look at this.
Synchronicity.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.501
How'd it go in there?

49:21.584 --> 49:23.878
This generation's devoid
of anything resembling mirth,

49:23.961 --> 49:25.838
but I made my points. You?

49:25.921 --> 49:27.339
They're young'uns. That's for sure.

49:27.423 --> 49:28.340
You got time for lunch?

49:28.424 --> 49:30.134
-I'm starving.
-How about Steady Eddie's?

49:30.217 --> 49:32.511
-Or the Italian place?
-Is it okay if we smell like garlic?

49:32.595 --> 49:35.264
Not smelling like garlic
is way overrated if you ask me.

49:35.347 --> 49:38.684
So what do you think?
The Italian place? Paris?

49:38.768 --> 49:40.019
-Oh, my God.
-What is it?

49:40.102 --> 49:41.270
Oh, my God!

49:45.315 --> 49:47.985
- Tristin?
- Get out! Get out!

49:55.492 --> 49:58.328
-What the hell?
-Was that Tristin out there?

49:58.412 --> 49:59.622
Of course it was Tristin.

49:59.705 --> 50:03.083
With that pouty mouth,
those liquid eyes. Who else?

50:03.167 --> 50:04.877
The janitor in softer light?

50:04.960 --> 50:08.214
-What is this? What am I feeling?
-I don't know. What are you feeling?

50:08.297 --> 50:14.011
I'm feeling fear...
and loneliness and heartache.

50:14.094 --> 50:16.847
Listen to me. I sound
like a freaking Blake Shelton song.

50:16.931 --> 50:19.349
-Yours is better.
-My hands are shaking.

50:19.433 --> 50:22.978
My heart is pounding.
God... I thought I was past this.

50:23.062 --> 50:25.147
He must be here
for the same reason we are.

50:25.230 --> 50:26.774
And to hit on girls.

50:26.857 --> 50:30.027
You saw him out there,
mackin' on that slutty biznotch.

50:30.110 --> 50:32.029
Now you're just freaking me out.
Calm down.

50:32.112 --> 50:34.740
And he didn't even look at me.
Not so much as a glance.

50:34.824 --> 50:37.618
All my education, the advanced degrees,

50:37.702 --> 50:40.162
the academic awards,
all my accomplishments...

50:40.245 --> 50:42.915
The private club, the Pilates,
the dermabrasions,

50:42.998 --> 50:45.710
the subtle nips and tucks,
and I'm still just Paris Geller,

50:45.793 --> 50:47.878
the amazing, insignificant,
invisible girl.

50:47.962 --> 50:49.088
You've had nips and tucks?

50:49.171 --> 50:51.548
-Do not abandon me.
-I'm not.

50:51.632 --> 50:53.050
-I'm pathetic.
-No.

50:53.133 --> 50:54.802
Oh, really?

50:54.885 --> 50:56.679
Check out what's in my briefcase.

50:57.597 --> 50:59.098
Nothing.

50:59.181 --> 51:03.936
I thought people would think
I was important because I had briefcase.

51:04.604 --> 51:05.896
I'm a phony.

51:08.941 --> 51:10.568
What's going on?

51:10.651 --> 51:12.778
Come on!

51:12.862 --> 51:15.280
-I'm still in love with Tristin.
-What? No.

51:15.364 --> 51:16.657
Yes.

51:16.741 --> 51:18.117
No.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.201
I don't know.

51:20.119 --> 51:23.038
You are feeling vulnerable right now.
That's what this is.

51:23.122 --> 51:26.208
You're going through a divorce.
You have your business, the kids.

51:26.291 --> 51:29.211
The kids hate me.
They like the nanny.

51:29.294 --> 51:31.130
Last Christmas, they cried until she came.

51:31.213 --> 51:35.342
I don't blame them. I like the nanny, too.
I cry sometimes when she leaves.

51:35.425 --> 51:38.012
Oh... hello.

51:38.095 --> 51:40.430
Francie. Figures.

51:40.514 --> 51:42.307
-What?
-You're catching us at a bad time.

51:42.391 --> 51:46.561
-Are you stalking me?
-Sorry, did I accidentally step into 2003?

51:46.646 --> 51:49.899
What do you need?
Expanded lunch hours?

51:49.982 --> 51:52.442
Hemlines shortened
to just below the hoo-ha?

51:52.526 --> 51:53.861
Should I get the nurse?

51:53.944 --> 51:58.407
Or are you and Rory in cahoots again,
planning a get-together behind my back?

51:58.490 --> 52:00.075
Is that why you didn't want
to get lunch?

52:00.159 --> 52:03.370
I did. We were doing Italian.
We're having a bad day.

52:03.453 --> 52:05.706
You always tried to get
between me and Rory,

52:05.790 --> 52:07.457
you destroyed my student council career,

52:07.541 --> 52:09.835
and you ruined my chance
to get into Harvard.

52:09.919 --> 52:14.214
Paris, you're an MD, a lawyer,
an expert on neoclassical architecture,

52:14.298 --> 52:16.801
and, I think,
a certified dental technician to boot.

52:16.884 --> 52:19.469
You rule the world.
What's your damage?

52:19.553 --> 52:22.097
Oh, you've been spying on me?
Cyber-stalking me?

52:22.181 --> 52:23.598
How do you know all this?

52:23.683 --> 52:26.351
-You invited me on LinkedIn.
-Yeah, right.

52:26.435 --> 52:28.938
Take a powder, Baby John.
This is our turf!

52:29.021 --> 52:30.522
Sure. Fine.

52:30.605 --> 52:33.317
We'll just catch up
at the Puffs reunion next month.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.028
Oops. No we won't,
because you never got Puffed.

52:36.111 --> 52:38.113
-Screw you!
-Eat me!

52:39.573 --> 52:40.783
Nice to see you, Francie.

52:42.201 --> 52:43.577
I miss Doyle.

52:43.660 --> 52:45.329
Calm down.

52:45.412 --> 52:48.290
I miss the sex.
It was volcanic.

52:48.373 --> 52:50.375
Oh, boy. I didn't need to know that.

52:50.459 --> 52:51.626
I'm untethered.

52:51.711 --> 52:54.213
I'm a mylar balloon
floating into an infinite void,

52:54.296 --> 52:55.756
and I missed my last period.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.133
You're going through
a bad stretch here, Paris.

52:58.217 --> 53:02.221
Just slow down, reassess,
then change course. It'll get better.

53:02.304 --> 53:04.974
-Thanks for the cut-rate Confucius.
-Hey!

53:05.057 --> 53:06.141
Sorry.

53:06.225 --> 53:08.853
I've got... three meetings

53:08.936 --> 53:11.396
and a panel discussion
at the 92nd Street Y,

53:11.480 --> 53:15.109
and I have got to get myself together
because Lena Dunham's the moderator.

53:15.192 --> 53:17.277
She cannot see me like this.

53:21.824 --> 53:25.035
-Don't tell anyone about the briefcase.
-Your secret's safe with me.

53:31.708 --> 53:35.629
- Thank you for stopping by.
- I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

53:35.712 --> 53:38.215
Now, I have a question,
and there's a point to it.

53:38.298 --> 53:39.341
Shoot.

53:39.424 --> 53:41.510
Have you ever considered
getting your master's?

53:41.593 --> 53:42.594
Why?

53:42.677 --> 53:46.015
So you could come back
and be on the faculty here.

53:46.098 --> 53:48.142
Oh. Wow.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.019
It's not a bad place to work.

53:50.102 --> 53:52.271
Not at all. I'm very flattered.

53:52.354 --> 53:54.273
I've always
thought the world of you, Rory.

53:54.356 --> 53:55.566
All of us here have.

53:55.649 --> 53:58.152
And your experience
since you left us...

53:58.235 --> 54:00.570
Top of your class at Yale, your writings.

54:00.654 --> 54:04.033
We have a spot open for you
in whatever department you choose.

54:04.116 --> 54:06.243
English, history...

54:06.326 --> 54:08.703
Uh, not so much musical composition.

54:08.788 --> 54:10.330
Oh, well, then I'm out of here.

54:10.414 --> 54:12.124
Thoughts?

54:13.542 --> 54:17.212
I thought about getting a master's.
Years ago. A PhD.

54:17.296 --> 54:20.715
But... I was impatient.
I wanted to get out into the world.

54:20.800 --> 54:23.969
Yes, you were always internally stronger
than everyone else.

54:24.053 --> 54:27.848
I suppose you get that from your mother.
She was a real spitfire.

54:27.932 --> 54:30.893
- Still is.
- We all go through bad stretches.

54:30.976 --> 54:34.688
Oh. No, I'm not going
through a bad stretch.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.107
Then my language was too strong.

54:37.191 --> 54:41.946
It's just that when I hear that someone
of your caliber is living here and there,

54:42.029 --> 54:43.948
I wonder if I can be of assistance.

54:44.031 --> 54:48.243
I appreciate it,
but I don't think teaching's my future.

54:48.327 --> 54:49.870
But thank you so much.

54:49.954 --> 54:51.621
Come in!

54:51.705 --> 54:54.208
-Keep in touch, though.
-I'll keep in touch.

54:54.291 --> 54:57.962
Headmaster, the students
from Paris Geller's lecture are here.

54:58.045 --> 54:59.213
Bring them in.

55:00.130 --> 55:01.673
The Paris postmortem.

55:01.756 --> 55:04.259
A headmaster's work is never done.

55:21.401 --> 55:23.695
- Blow my colon.
- What now?

55:23.778 --> 55:26.240
I left my glasses upstairs.
Three flights up.

55:26.323 --> 55:27.324
Well, so go get 'em.

55:27.407 --> 55:31.245
I'm exhausted from this day, Rory.
I can't take these stairs.

55:31.328 --> 55:33.705
-So ask Clementina to go get them.
-No, no, no.

55:33.789 --> 55:36.166
That's how we lost the kids' last nanny.
To those stairs.

55:36.250 --> 55:38.835
-How?
-This place is a vertical Armageddon.

55:38.919 --> 55:41.755
Five stories.
And Doyle wouldn't put in an elevator

55:41.838 --> 55:44.466
because it'd ruin
the building's architectural integrity.

55:44.549 --> 55:48.428
He just loved telling people,
"It's pre-war. Pre-Civil War."

55:48.512 --> 55:51.140
Like that wouldn't make
Dorothy Parker barf.

55:51.223 --> 55:52.724
Hello.

55:52.807 --> 55:53.808
Speak of the devil.

55:53.892 --> 55:56.311
So we lose our nanny
because she won't take the stairs.

55:56.395 --> 55:57.229
We're here.

55:57.312 --> 55:59.606
Meanwhile,
Doyle's renting a loft in Tribeca.

55:59.689 --> 56:02.276
- One story and it has an elevator.
- Hello?

56:02.359 --> 56:05.153
-Doyle, just come in!
-I didn't know if you wanted me to.

56:05.237 --> 56:08.490
What are you going to do?
Shove the kids through the mail slot?

56:09.699 --> 56:10.993
Hello, my babies.

56:11.076 --> 56:12.494
Hi, Mommy.

56:12.577 --> 56:14.538
Go up with Clementina.
I'll be up in a minute.

56:14.621 --> 56:15.915
Yes, miss.
Come on, little ones.

56:15.998 --> 56:17.707
Hey, fun day, guys.
Right?

56:17.791 --> 56:19.793
Fun day?
All right. Fun day.

56:19.876 --> 56:22.879
-Hey, Rory. It's nice to see you.
-Hey, Doyle.

56:22.963 --> 56:24.798
See, I didn't poison her against you.

56:24.881 --> 56:27.592
-I know. She and I e-mail now and then.
-You guys e-mail?

56:27.676 --> 56:29.594
They suck you
into the Condé Nast universe yet?

56:29.678 --> 56:30.930
-Still working on it.
-Really?

56:31.013 --> 56:33.473
-You've been talking about it for months.
-You guys talk?

56:33.557 --> 56:35.475
-How's the screenwriting going?
-Great.

56:35.559 --> 56:38.061
Just got in last night
from a pretty big meeting in LA.

56:38.145 --> 56:39.396
-Don't sit.
-How'd it go?

56:39.479 --> 56:40.772
Pulled in off of Melrose,

56:40.855 --> 56:44.109
sat on their Italian couch,
drank a Fiji Water,

56:44.192 --> 56:46.320
pitched them an idea
I came up with at the airport.

56:46.403 --> 56:50.240
Then they stuck a sack full of money
in my pocket and flew me home first class.

56:50.324 --> 56:52.659
-Bunch of nitwits.
-The kids ate, right?

56:52.743 --> 56:54.953
-They're eating here.
-There's nothing here, Doyle.

56:55.037 --> 56:56.788
So have Clementina take them out.

56:56.871 --> 56:58.958
-She just went upstairs.
-She went upstairs?

56:59.041 --> 57:02.169
-You were right here.
-Why would you let her go upstairs?

57:02.252 --> 57:04.379
Because I didn't know
she had to come back down.

57:04.463 --> 57:07.341
Now I have to go upstairs,
tell her to bring the kids downstairs,

57:07.424 --> 57:09.426
take them out, bring them home,
take them upstairs,

57:09.509 --> 57:11.053
and we'll lose this nanny, too.

57:11.136 --> 57:14.348
-We cannot lose this nanny.
-We're still paying off the last nanny.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.683
Guys, I will take the kids
to get something to eat.

57:16.766 --> 57:18.477
-Really?
-You'll go upstairs?

57:18.560 --> 57:20.520
- Yeah. Yes.
- And bring them down?

57:20.604 --> 57:22.356
And take them out and bring them back?

57:22.439 --> 57:24.733
Or leave them in an alley.
One of those two things.

57:24.816 --> 57:27.527
-Thank you, Rory.
-Yeah, thanks, Rory.

57:27.611 --> 57:29.863
Bye, guys.
Kiss the kids again.

57:33.450 --> 57:34.493
What?

57:34.576 --> 57:36.578
Are you and Doyle having an affair?

57:55.722 --> 57:57.057
<i>Waiting...</i>

58:02.354 --> 58:03.897
<i>Waiting...</i>

58:06.566 --> 58:08.152
<i>Hey, there.</i>

58:08.235 --> 58:10.278
Oh, shoot. Did I wake you up?

58:10.362 --> 58:12.322
I woke you up. It's 2:00 a.m. there.

58:12.406 --> 58:15.117
No, no, no, it's fine. I'm up.
Everything okay?

58:15.200 --> 58:17.995
Yeah, I'm... I just... um...

58:18.078 --> 58:19.204
What?

58:19.288 --> 58:21.248
-I really hate to do this.
<i>-What?</i>

58:21.331 --> 58:23.042
-Come on.
<i>-Um...</i>

58:23.625 --> 58:27.212
Would your father still be willing to put
in a good word for me at Condé Nast?

58:27.296 --> 58:29.798
-Absolutely.
<i>-It's okay if he won't.</i>

58:29.881 --> 58:33.218
-I mean, I don't know how serious he was.
-No, he'll do it for sure.

58:33.301 --> 58:35.721
He does stuff like this
all the time for lesser mortals.

58:36.304 --> 58:37.806
I really didn't want to do it this way.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.434
-Don't be embarrassed.
-I'm not.

58:40.517 --> 58:42.436
-Pride's a little hurt.
<i>-Get over it.</i>

58:42.519 --> 58:46.690
I'll give you a text when it's done.
Okay? Be happy.

58:46.773 --> 58:48.400
<i>I'm happy. Oops, hold on.</i>

58:48.483 --> 58:50.152
<i>-What?</i>
-Oh, uh...

58:50.235 --> 58:52.404
I thought the baby was gonna throw up.

58:52.487 --> 58:54.114
Your life change since I last saw you?

58:54.197 --> 58:55.741
It's Paris' kid. I'm babysitting.

58:55.824 --> 58:57.242
Did you find your lucky outfit, Ace?

58:57.326 --> 58:59.494
There is no sign.
Thank you again.

58:59.578 --> 59:02.372
<i>-And thank your father for me.</i>
-No problem. Really.

59:02.456 --> 59:07.211
All right, well, I guess I should, uh,
let you get back to bed.

59:07.294 --> 59:09.796
Okay, I'll let you know, Ace.
And...

59:10.839 --> 59:11.840
good luck.

59:12.841 --> 59:13.800
Thanks, Logan.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.934
She's great. She's depressing.

59:23.018 --> 59:24.895
Failed to find a jolly way
to tell us

59:24.978 --> 59:27.814
that the Pacific Seaboard west
of the I-5 was going down.

59:27.897 --> 59:30.650
-I always like a spoonful of sugar.
-"Consider the Lobster"?

59:30.734 --> 59:32.569
It's a serious subject,
but funny and truthful.

59:32.652 --> 59:34.279
That's the camp I'd put you in.

59:34.363 --> 59:35.864
I mean, no one's David Foster Wallace,

59:35.947 --> 59:39.284
but there's an erudition to your stuff,
and some whimsy, which I like.

59:39.368 --> 59:40.535
I'll cop to that.

59:40.619 --> 59:42.579
-Your <i>Talk </i>piece had it.
-Yeah, it was great.

59:42.662 --> 59:46.291
And all your interviews are spot on.
You're in the piece, but not too much.

59:46.375 --> 59:47.876
So, what are you up to now?

59:48.835 --> 59:51.713
Oh, I, uh... well, I'm here.
Hello.

59:51.796 --> 59:54.341
And, um...

59:54.424 --> 59:56.468
I'm just finishing up some things.

59:56.551 --> 59:58.678
And, um, I...
I'm working on a book proposal.

59:58.762 --> 1:00:01.223
Oh, cool. What's the book?
If you don't mind.

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:04.351
It's actually an expansion
of my <i>Talk </i>piece on Naomi Shropshire.

1:00:04.434 --> 1:00:05.769
Really?

1:00:05.852 --> 1:00:07.271
Wow. Interesting.

1:00:07.354 --> 1:00:09.439
Uh, she's a little unhinged, isn't she?

1:00:09.523 --> 1:00:11.983
-Makes her all the more interesting.
-What else?

1:00:12.066 --> 1:00:14.611
I'm heading back to London
in just a couple days.

1:00:14.694 --> 1:00:17.156
-There's a website after me.
-There must be a million.

1:00:17.239 --> 1:00:20.534
-We have a couple things floating around.
-Mmm-hmm. Some sports stuff.

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:22.869
It would be an outsider's perspective
coming from me.

1:00:22.952 --> 1:00:24.329
And we prefer that sometimes.

1:00:24.413 --> 1:00:26.873
And lines.
That's been an elusive one.

1:00:26.956 --> 1:00:28.625
- Lines?
- The ones all over New York.

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:31.461
You pass them all the time.
People line up for anything.

1:00:31.545 --> 1:00:33.797
Collectibles, fast food,
restaurant openings.

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:36.133
It's the psychology of the group
that we're interested in.

1:00:36.216 --> 1:00:37.551
What's the commonality?

1:00:37.634 --> 1:00:40.554
David Wallace would've nailed it,
but so far we haven't.

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:41.555
I love that.

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:44.099
I'll confess, I've stood
in a lot of lines, and it's a thing.

1:00:44.182 --> 1:00:46.309
Noodle it around a bit, okay?
And keep in touch?

1:00:46.393 --> 1:00:47.519
Definitely.

1:00:48.437 --> 1:00:50.522
-So nice to meet you.
-Here's my cell.

1:00:50.605 --> 1:00:52.899
The <i>Talk</i> piece was great. Really.

1:00:52.982 --> 1:00:55.444
- Thanks, Jim. Denise. Have a good day.
- You, too.

1:00:55.527 --> 1:00:57.571
-Don't lose the card.
-I won't. Bye.

1:00:57.654 --> 1:00:59.072
Gary, bring the book in here.

1:00:59.156 --> 1:01:01.449
- Art department's freaking out.
- What else is new?

1:01:01.533 --> 1:01:03.577
Don't forget,
you have that thing at Bemelmans.

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:05.120
- Oh. That's tonight?
- Yeah.

1:01:05.204 --> 1:01:08.665
Have Brad bring me a sandwich.
I can't drink on an empty stomach.

1:01:10.792 --> 1:01:12.794
Come in!

1:01:13.795 --> 1:01:15.964
Sorry, I'm late.

1:01:16.047 --> 1:01:19.259
These drive-through coffee places?
Love the concept. But Heather and I?

1:01:19.342 --> 1:01:21.887
We're gonna need to rehearse
the cup pass a couple more times.

1:01:22.470 --> 1:01:23.638
Oh, my mom's late, too?

1:01:23.722 --> 1:01:26.057
-I haven't heard from her.
-Really?

1:01:26.140 --> 1:01:29.269
She doesn't usually pick up the phone
when she's driving, but...

1:01:30.687 --> 1:01:33.690
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Oh, Mom, are you on your way?

1:01:33.773 --> 1:01:35.984
-No, I'm at home.
<i>-It's Tuesday.</i>

1:01:36.067 --> 1:01:37.569
-I know what day it is.
-<i>Well...</i>

1:01:37.652 --> 1:01:39.446
Claudia and I are here.
Just the two of us.

1:01:39.529 --> 1:01:41.823
The couch cushions are fluffed.
The candle's lit.

1:01:41.906 --> 1:01:43.658
-I'm quitting.
<i>-What?</i>

1:01:43.742 --> 1:01:45.911
-I'm done. I'm not coming anymore.
-Why?

1:01:45.994 --> 1:01:48.788
We've had six sessions,
and you are no different.

1:01:48.872 --> 1:01:50.457
-What?
<i>-And that woman isn't helping.</i>

1:01:50.540 --> 1:01:52.709
-Who, Claudia?
-She's a dolt.

1:01:52.792 --> 1:01:55.212
I don't need to pay someone
not to agree with me.

1:01:55.295 --> 1:01:56.796
-But--
<i>-I'm not coming.</i>

1:01:56.880 --> 1:01:59.591
Sorry you made the trip. Goodbye.

1:02:00.842 --> 1:02:02.761
-She quit.
-I'm sorry.

1:02:02.844 --> 1:02:05.597
-She started this whole damn thing.
-It happens.

1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:08.141
-I just... With no notice.
-It's not unusual.

1:02:08.225 --> 1:02:10.685
She said I was no different.

1:02:10.769 --> 1:02:13.605
Me. This wasn't for me.
This was for her.

1:02:13.688 --> 1:02:15.440
People have expectations
when they come here.

1:02:15.524 --> 1:02:17.692
Very often, the reality is different.

1:02:17.776 --> 1:02:19.486
What sort of transformation
did she expect?

1:02:19.569 --> 1:02:20.862
I come in here Lorelai Gilmore,

1:02:20.945 --> 1:02:23.365
and two months later,
I walk out Queen Latifah?

1:02:23.448 --> 1:02:26.618
- Probably not Queen Latifah.
- Oh, she is amazing.

1:02:26.701 --> 1:02:29.454
She smoked me out, got me here...
"I'm no different."

1:02:29.537 --> 1:02:31.289
Different?
She doesn't even know who I am.

1:02:31.373 --> 1:02:33.250
-Are you...
-Am I...

1:02:33.333 --> 1:02:34.501
Staying?

1:02:34.584 --> 1:02:37.003
Oh.
No, I've got a million things to do.

1:02:37.086 --> 1:02:38.755
Oh, okay.

1:02:38.838 --> 1:02:40.465
I mean, I should just go, right?

1:02:40.549 --> 1:02:43.968
Well, the hour's paid for.
Anything you want to talk about?

1:02:44.052 --> 1:02:45.470
Uh, no. No, nothing.

1:02:45.554 --> 1:02:47.556
Wait, my mother's crazy.
Okay, now nothing.

1:02:49.391 --> 1:02:52.185
-I don't know. It's been weird lately.
-How so?

1:02:52.269 --> 1:02:54.771
Uh, this whole thing
was supposed to be grief therapy.

1:02:54.854 --> 1:02:57.399
You know, my mother's grief therapy,
because of Dad.

1:02:57.482 --> 1:02:59.067
Because of Dad dying...
I get it.

1:02:59.150 --> 1:03:02.153
It was a stunner.
It was a stunner for all of us.

1:03:02.236 --> 1:03:04.906
-Yeah, she talked about it.
-It was just so fast.

1:03:05.490 --> 1:03:07.826
I was at the inn,
working on the books a little,

1:03:07.909 --> 1:03:09.911
using the calculator on my phone...

1:03:11.079 --> 1:03:12.372
and it rang.

1:03:12.456 --> 1:03:15.041
And it was Mom with the news.

1:03:16.042 --> 1:03:17.877
He was in the ICU.

1:03:17.961 --> 1:03:19.546
Heart attack. Big one.

1:03:20.463 --> 1:03:22.173
And we hung up.

1:03:22.257 --> 1:03:25.218
And my phone went back
to being a calculator.

1:03:25.802 --> 1:03:26.970
It just seemed so unreal.

1:03:27.554 --> 1:03:29.264
You can't plan for these things.

1:03:29.347 --> 1:03:31.349
And he never got out of the ICU.

1:03:31.891 --> 1:03:35.228
He was conscious at times,
but in and out.

1:03:35.312 --> 1:03:38.106
And he was angry.
He was really angry.

1:03:38.189 --> 1:03:39.899
He couldn't believe it.

1:03:39.983 --> 1:03:41.651
He's Richard Gilmore.

1:03:41.735 --> 1:03:45.071
This is not how Richard Gilmore goes down.

1:03:46.072 --> 1:03:48.367
-You know what his last words were?
-No.

1:03:49.451 --> 1:03:51.703
"Get the hell away from me."

1:03:52.621 --> 1:03:54.373
Aimed at the nurses, not... not us.

1:03:54.456 --> 1:03:56.958
It was actually pretty funny.

1:03:58.167 --> 1:04:00.086
And then...

1:04:01.170 --> 1:04:02.714
just like that.

1:04:04.132 --> 1:04:06.050
I didn't get that moment, you know?

1:04:06.134 --> 1:04:07.802
That Lifetime movie moment,

1:04:07.886 --> 1:04:11.014
"I love you, Lorelai."
"I love you too, Dad."

1:04:11.097 --> 1:04:12.682
Mom didn't get it either.

1:04:14.142 --> 1:04:15.894
Fifty years.

1:04:15.977 --> 1:04:18.855
They were married 50 years.

1:04:20.357 --> 1:04:22.776
That thing she said last week,
about me and Luke.

1:04:22.859 --> 1:04:25.779
About us being partners,
because we're not married.

1:04:25.862 --> 1:04:28.698
-Like we're a comedy team.
-Feels like it struck a chord.

1:04:28.782 --> 1:04:31.326
My mother strikes more chords
than Esa-Pekka Salonen.

1:04:31.409 --> 1:04:32.827
Hmm. Lorelai...

1:04:33.327 --> 1:04:36.873
you should know many people
have full, lasting emotional relationships

1:04:36.956 --> 1:04:38.332
without being married.

1:04:38.417 --> 1:04:39.751
I know.

1:04:40.460 --> 1:04:42.462
Do you want to be married?

1:04:42.546 --> 1:04:45.632
I've been married. You didn't know that.
To Rory's father.

1:04:46.216 --> 1:04:47.634
It was brief.

1:04:47.717 --> 1:04:52.681
We have... had a long,
complicated relationship.

1:04:53.598 --> 1:04:54.933
And it didn't end badly.

1:04:55.016 --> 1:04:57.394
It just ended
because it shouldn't have happened.

1:04:58.352 --> 1:05:00.439
It was supposed to be Luke.

1:05:02.106 --> 1:05:03.775
It was always supposed to be Luke.

1:05:03.858 --> 1:05:05.777
If it was always supposed to be Luke--

1:05:05.860 --> 1:05:06.945
Then why aren't we married?

1:05:07.028 --> 1:05:09.113
Why?

1:05:09.697 --> 1:05:13.910
I just don't do things like my mother.

1:05:13.993 --> 1:05:15.829
-Dinner the other night.
-What happened?

1:05:15.912 --> 1:05:17.705
-She attacked Luke.
-How?

1:05:17.789 --> 1:05:20.041
-With a bag of money.
-I don't get it.

1:05:20.124 --> 1:05:21.460
It was money my father put aside

1:05:21.543 --> 1:05:24.003
for Luke to spend
on something Luke doesn't want.

1:05:24.087 --> 1:05:27.674
That my father
can still hover like that.

1:05:29.634 --> 1:05:30.593
We're happy.

1:05:32.596 --> 1:05:34.180
He's very happy.

1:05:35.682 --> 1:05:38.768
Luke and I are... happy.

1:05:43.648 --> 1:05:44.733
Thanks, Luke.

1:05:44.816 --> 1:05:46.735
Hey, Caesar,
can you get 'em change for me?

1:05:46.818 --> 1:05:48.236
Got it.

1:05:48.319 --> 1:05:52.240
Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no.

1:05:52.323 --> 1:05:54.325
No. Please, no.

1:05:54.408 --> 1:05:56.369
Hello, Luke.

1:05:56.453 --> 1:05:58.246
Mrs. Gilmore, hi.
What's going on?

1:05:58.329 --> 1:06:01.332
-Luke, this is Ida. Ida, Luke.
-We gotta get started.

1:06:01.415 --> 1:06:03.543
-We got a lot of ground to cover.
-Started on...

1:06:03.626 --> 1:06:05.587
- We're seeing properties.
- Properties?

1:06:05.670 --> 1:06:08.381
Three gems, an in-betweener
and a dog with a price I like.

1:06:08.465 --> 1:06:10.800
-Maybe we should drop the dog.
-But it's close by.

1:06:10.884 --> 1:06:13.303
If it's the first franchise,
Luke can zip back and forth.

1:06:13.386 --> 1:06:14.428
Zip back and forth?

1:06:14.513 --> 1:06:16.055
- That makes sense.
- What?

1:06:16.139 --> 1:06:17.557
-Are you ready?
-To do what?

1:06:17.641 --> 1:06:19.976
To see your potential
franchise locations, of course.

1:06:20.059 --> 1:06:22.061
Oh, now, Mrs. Gilmore--

1:06:22.145 --> 1:06:23.312
Call her Mom.

1:06:25.940 --> 1:06:28.777
Uh, didn't Lorelai talk to you about this?

1:06:28.860 --> 1:06:31.488
This has nothing to do with Lorelai.
This is about you.

1:06:31.571 --> 1:06:34.323
-Did you lose that card I gave you?
-I gave it to Lorelai.

1:06:34.407 --> 1:06:37.577
Really? Do you give all
your important business cards to Lorelai?

1:06:37.661 --> 1:06:39.829
-Is she your secretary?
-No, but I--

1:06:39.913 --> 1:06:43.416
Now, I'm assuming you have someone
to look after the place while you're gone?

1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:44.918
-Yes. Caesar.
-Yep?

1:06:45.001 --> 1:06:47.796
Um, uh, can you watch the place
for a little while,

1:06:47.879 --> 1:06:50.423
or do you still have that thing
you were going to?

1:06:50.507 --> 1:06:52.967
-You know, that appointment?
-Nope, I'm all yours.

1:06:53.051 --> 1:06:55.678
Oh, good. He has a Caesar.

1:06:55.762 --> 1:06:57.681
Caesar can run one of the franchises.

1:06:57.764 --> 1:06:59.724
- Run what?
- You got any other Caesars?

1:06:59.808 --> 1:07:00.892
No, just the one.

1:07:00.975 --> 1:07:02.852
-You're gonna need more.
-Let's hit the road.

1:07:02.936 --> 1:07:04.646
I gotta confirm all this stuff.

1:07:05.939 --> 1:07:07.816
Is that the shirt you wear
on business outings?

1:07:07.899 --> 1:07:10.026
-Yeah.
-There's blood on it.

1:07:10.109 --> 1:07:11.194
Nah, that's jelly.

1:07:11.903 --> 1:07:13.029
I'll be right back.

1:07:16.032 --> 1:07:18.409
If I'm running something,
I'm gonna need a raise.

1:07:18.493 --> 1:07:20.161
Order up!

1:07:24.791 --> 1:07:26.084
-This place is still open.
-So?

1:07:26.167 --> 1:07:27.877
-It's not available.
-Everything is.

1:07:27.961 --> 1:07:30.380
-It's a kind of a bad neighborhood.
-It's up-and-coming.

1:07:30.463 --> 1:07:32.506
-It's gonna explode.
-See? Up-and-coming.

1:07:32.591 --> 1:07:36.302
No, they illegally tapped their gas.
It's literally going to explode.

1:07:36.386 --> 1:07:38.888
-What can I do for you folks?
-I'm sorry about this.

1:07:38.972 --> 1:07:40.557
-Ida Friedman.
-Sam Duncan.

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:43.101
So nice to meet you, Sam.

1:07:43.184 --> 1:07:46.062
Sam is four months behind
in his payments.

1:07:46.145 --> 1:07:48.272
The marshal's already sniffing around.

1:07:48.356 --> 1:07:50.358
-Excellent.
-I'm really sorry about this.

1:07:50.441 --> 1:07:53.402
-It all has to go.
-The bankruptcy court'll take it anyway.

1:07:53.486 --> 1:07:54.863
He won't have a pot to piss in.

1:07:54.946 --> 1:07:58.366
-What must the bathrooms look like?
-Dresden after the bombings is my guess.

1:07:58.449 --> 1:08:01.578
It needs to be lighter.
White paint, yellow accents.

1:08:01.661 --> 1:08:04.330
- Oh, and look at that ridiculous clock.
- Ugh.

1:08:04.998 --> 1:08:07.166
You thought the second place
was a possibility?

1:08:07.250 --> 1:08:10.128
-You'd have to blow out the back...
-You'd have to.

1:08:10.211 --> 1:08:11.630
But permits take forever.

1:08:11.713 --> 1:08:15.049
Put an Andrew Jackson in the right hands,
they'll stir your soup.

1:08:15.133 --> 1:08:18.552
And Luke, are you good with putting
number two in the maybe column?

1:08:18.637 --> 1:08:19.846
-Number two?
-Number two.

1:08:19.929 --> 1:08:23.099
- You'd have to blow out the back.
- He's in default. He can't complain.

1:08:23.182 --> 1:08:24.851
Yeah, blow it out. That sounds good.

1:08:24.934 --> 1:08:26.769
- Luke is good with number two.
- Hold on.

1:08:26.853 --> 1:08:29.230
-He'd be crazy not to be.
-So that's four possibilities.

1:08:29.314 --> 1:08:30.315
No, three plus a maybe.

1:08:30.398 --> 1:08:32.191
-When do you start negotiating?
-Yesterday.

1:08:32.275 --> 1:08:34.068
-Everything's a negotiation.
-Let's start.

1:08:34.152 --> 1:08:36.863
-You're in good hands.
-We're gonna squeeze in one more place.

1:08:36.946 --> 1:08:39.240
Don't you have that thing
you gotta get to today?

1:08:39.323 --> 1:08:41.034
-What thing?
-Your therapy with Lorelai?

1:08:41.117 --> 1:08:43.786
-You don't want to miss that.
-Oh, I stopped that a week ago.

1:08:44.495 --> 1:08:46.205
Oh, right. Right.

1:08:46.289 --> 1:08:48.750
-She didn't tell you?
-No. No, she told me.

1:08:48.833 --> 1:08:50.543
She never told you.

1:08:50.627 --> 1:08:52.086
Oh, here we are.

1:08:52.837 --> 1:08:55.632
-Oh, it's cute.
-It's shaped like a teacup.

1:08:55.715 --> 1:08:57.175
And it's near a prison.

1:08:59.260 --> 1:09:00.637
<i>Just closin' up, fellas.</i>

1:09:02.430 --> 1:09:05.934
Hi. I know you're sick of hearing this,
but this movie, <i>History of Violence?</i>

1:09:06.017 --> 1:09:07.518
Viggo Mortensen is you.

1:09:07.601 --> 1:09:10.772
-He's totally you.
-I know. You've said it before.

1:09:10.855 --> 1:09:12.315
David Cronenberg owes you money.

1:09:12.398 --> 1:09:15.026
He must have dropped by the diner,
got inspired,

1:09:15.109 --> 1:09:16.986
and turned you into this ex-thug guy.

1:09:17.070 --> 1:09:19.614
-He must have been in.
-I don't even know what he looks like.

1:09:19.698 --> 1:09:22.575
- Or maybe Viggo Mortensen came by...
<i>- Coffee!</i>

1:09:22.659 --> 1:09:25.286
observed you
and called David Cronenberg

1:09:25.370 --> 1:09:26.913
with the idea. They're very close.

1:09:26.996 --> 1:09:29.916
-You know what Viggo looks like.
-Like looking in a mirror.

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:31.459
You okay?

1:09:31.542 --> 1:09:33.837
Yeah, just tired.

1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:36.380
-Wanna order in?
-I can whip something up.

1:09:36.464 --> 1:09:37.966
All right, start whipping.

1:09:38.049 --> 1:09:40.969
Hmm. Hey, uh, how was therapy today?

1:09:41.052 --> 1:09:43.387
Same old, same old.

1:09:43.471 --> 1:09:45.598
My mother did most of the talking,
as usual.

1:09:45.682 --> 1:09:46.933
Right.

1:09:48.351 --> 1:09:50.603
It's a fancy shirt.
Did you go to the bank?

1:09:50.687 --> 1:09:52.814
Yeah. Yeah, the bank.

1:09:52.897 --> 1:09:54.648
-They like collars.
-They like collars.

1:09:55.900 --> 1:09:57.694
-All right, I'll get changed.
-Cool.

1:09:59.445 --> 1:10:02.323
Oh, I love this scene.

1:10:02.406 --> 1:10:04.408
But I can't watch this scene.

1:10:04.492 --> 1:10:05.618
But I love this scene.

1:10:13.376 --> 1:10:17.088
This is Poppy Corn,
and this is Taco Terrie.

1:10:17.171 --> 1:10:19.716
-Oh, hi, Clementina.
-Oh, Paris is not home.

1:10:19.799 --> 1:10:22.719
She told me I could hang out here
when I'm in the city.

1:10:22.802 --> 1:10:24.553
If you want, I could watch the kids.

1:10:24.637 --> 1:10:26.430
-You could go rest upstairs.
-Not upstairs.

1:10:26.514 --> 1:10:29.976
-Or you could go out for a while.
-Okay. Thank you.

1:10:30.059 --> 1:10:31.811
Bye, babies.

1:10:34.856 --> 1:10:35.857
Hello?

1:10:35.940 --> 1:10:38.692
- <i>Yes, I'm calling for Rory Gilmore.</i>
- Speaking.

1:10:38.776 --> 1:10:42.280
My name is Robert Castellanos,
an attorney representing Naomi Shropshire.

1:10:42.363 --> 1:10:44.615
-Yes?
<i>-This is just a courtesy call.</i>

1:10:44.698 --> 1:10:47.493
My firm is preparing paperwork
you'll soon receive

1:10:47.576 --> 1:10:50.789
dissolving the contract
on your book project with Ms. Shropshire.

1:10:50.872 --> 1:10:52.874
-What a shock.
<i>-Excuse me?</i>

1:10:52.957 --> 1:10:56.544
-May I ask why she's doing this?
-Let's just say she's unhappy.

1:10:56.627 --> 1:10:59.172
Let me save you some time.
There is no contract.

1:10:59.255 --> 1:11:01.883
I was doing this on spec,
so there's nothing to dissolve.

1:11:01.966 --> 1:11:05.011
Ms. Shropshire would also like
all of your notes back.

1:11:05.094 --> 1:11:08.181
-What notes? All she did was babble.
<i>-And Ms. Shropshire would like you to sign</i>

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:12.143
a letter waiving all rights
to the "whale and mouse" idea.

1:11:12.226 --> 1:11:14.813
Fine.
It wasn't exactly the next <i>Cloud Atlas.</i>

1:11:14.896 --> 1:11:18.817
-So you'll sign this?
-Yes. And it was a rabbit, not a mouse.

1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:20.193
Says here it was a mouse.

1:11:20.276 --> 1:11:23.696
I'll be sure to collect all my doodles
of martini glasses and hangman ropes.

1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:25.656
<i>I'll get all the blank pages to you</i>
<i>by tomorrow.</i>

1:11:25.740 --> 1:11:27.325
Just text me where to send them.

1:11:29.577 --> 1:11:30.787
She's a drunk!

1:11:36.667 --> 1:11:38.294
- Jim Nelson.
<i>- Jim, hi.</i>

1:11:38.377 --> 1:11:41.088
Sorry for the spontaneity here
and for calling your cell.

1:11:41.172 --> 1:11:43.466
This is Rory Gilmore.
Do you have a quick second?

1:11:43.549 --> 1:11:44.592
Oh, sure. What's up?

1:11:44.675 --> 1:11:47.011
Give me lines,
the story that's been floating around.

1:11:47.095 --> 1:11:48.471
Right, we talked about that.

1:11:48.554 --> 1:11:50.932
I have a take on it.
A good one. Let me take a crack.

1:11:51.015 --> 1:11:54.477
- I'm loving the confidence.
- I'm super confident.

1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:57.563
-I don't have any money to play with here.
-This would be on spec.

1:11:57.646 --> 1:12:00.399
Let me at it and I will show you
what I've got. No strings.

1:12:00.483 --> 1:12:03.319
Do it. Dummy it up for me
or come in and pitch. This is great.

1:12:03.402 --> 1:12:05.363
Thanks.
I'll call your office when I'm ready.

1:12:05.446 --> 1:12:08.324
<i>- Talk to you later.</i>
- Bye.

1:12:08.407 --> 1:12:10.409
Okay. Okay.

1:12:15.123 --> 1:12:16.290
Hi.

1:12:16.374 --> 1:12:18.084
<i>Hi!</i>
<i>I called you from all my phones.</i>

1:12:18.167 --> 1:12:20.461
<i>-Why didn't you pick up?</i>
-I didn't recognize those numbers.

1:12:20.545 --> 1:12:21.879
<i>Mom, you have my numbers.</i>

1:12:21.963 --> 1:12:24.340
You have, like, 14 numbers.
I can't keep track.

1:12:24.423 --> 1:12:26.759
One burner is still trying to reach me.

1:12:26.843 --> 1:12:27.885
I'm calling to let you know

1:12:27.969 --> 1:12:31.055
I won't be back tomorrow.
I'm working on a story here in the city.

1:12:31.139 --> 1:12:34.350
I thought you were coming back
and then flying to London to see Naomi.

1:12:34.433 --> 1:12:37.186
I'm not doing the Naomi thing anymore.
I've got a new thing.

1:12:37.270 --> 1:12:39.272
<i>-So no more book?</i>
-No more book. Catch up.

1:12:39.355 --> 1:12:42.066
-Crabby Rory alert.
<i>-I'm not crabby. I'm pumped.</i>

1:12:42.150 --> 1:12:43.860
<i>-I'm feeling my oats.</i>
-Share the oats.

1:12:43.943 --> 1:12:46.237
-It's for <i>GQ.</i>
-Oh, my God, you're at Condé Nast.

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:47.613
-No.
-Still catching up?

1:12:47.697 --> 1:12:50.491
I'm gonna write a piece
that's gonna knock their socks off at <i>GQ.</i>

1:12:50.575 --> 1:12:52.410
Those are people
who care about their socks.

1:12:52.493 --> 1:12:54.829
They don't get them in bunches of three
at the street fair.

1:12:54.913 --> 1:12:58.499
It's about lines in New York,
about the people who stand in line

1:12:58.583 --> 1:13:00.960
for countless hours
for what seems like minimal payout.

1:13:01.044 --> 1:13:03.421
It's about the people,
their goals, their dreams.

1:13:03.504 --> 1:13:05.464
-I love this.
<i>-So do I.</i>

1:13:05.548 --> 1:13:09.135
The Naomi thing was a waste of time,
but I'm just going with the flow here.

1:13:09.218 --> 1:13:11.595
-It's always good to go--
<i>-Making things happen.</i>

1:13:11.679 --> 1:13:13.722
Getting proactive.
It's time to turn that corner.

1:13:13.806 --> 1:13:16.475
-I knew you could--
-Turning the page. New leaf here.

1:13:16.559 --> 1:13:18.727
-Are you tap dancing?
-And scaring the kids a little.

1:13:18.811 --> 1:13:21.898
<i>-So, you're not upset about the book?</i>
-Uh, not in the least.

1:13:21.981 --> 1:13:24.150
Okay.
Well, do you want company?

1:13:24.233 --> 1:13:27.486
<i>-Yes! Oh, yes!</i>
-Ha! I've been working seven-day weeks.

1:13:27.570 --> 1:13:30.740
-I'd love a New York overnight.
-Company would be great. I'd love company.

1:13:30.823 --> 1:13:32.158
New York, here we come.

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:33.910
-Be thinking about lines.
-Like <i>Scarface?</i>

1:13:33.993 --> 1:13:35.411
<i>-Wrong lines.</i>
-I'll adjust.

1:13:35.494 --> 1:13:36.495
Gotta go.

1:13:38.331 --> 1:13:39.832
It's showtime!

1:13:44.045 --> 1:13:47.298
-Jesus, it's early.
-Don't walk with your eyes closed.

1:13:47.381 --> 1:13:51.510
Plowing into scaffolding and falling over
the Citi Bike showed me the folly of that.

1:13:51.594 --> 1:13:52.761
You're gonna be on New York 1.

1:13:52.845 --> 1:13:56.890
If they make me look bad, I'm gonna punch
Pat Kiernan right in the mansack.

1:13:56.975 --> 1:13:59.768
-Is this Cronuts?
-This is being hailed as the new Cronut.

1:13:59.852 --> 1:14:01.896
-How does the old Cronut feel?
-Threatened.

1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:03.772
-What time does it open?
-Not for two hours.

1:14:03.856 --> 1:14:06.400
-Holy spumoni.
-I'm gonna start talking to people.

1:14:06.484 --> 1:14:08.987
These are people? They look
like meat sticks with head balls.

1:14:09.070 --> 1:14:11.238
-Do you wanna find some coffee?
-Yes! Coffee.

1:14:11.322 --> 1:14:13.324
That way's the zombie McDonald's.
Go the other way.

1:14:13.407 --> 1:14:15.493
-I would fit in there.
-Too risky. Hit a street cart.

1:14:15.576 --> 1:14:16.577
On it!

1:14:19.413 --> 1:14:20.581
-Excuse me.
-Yeah.

1:14:20.665 --> 1:14:23.250
I'm doing a piece for <i>GQ.</i>
Would you be willing to talk to me?

1:14:23.334 --> 1:14:25.336
Sure. I definitely have time.

1:14:25.419 --> 1:14:27.421
What brings you here today?

1:14:27.505 --> 1:14:30.799
Well, I love pastry.
And I'm a big Yelper,

1:14:30.883 --> 1:14:32.969
so I try to get to things
before anyone else.

1:14:33.052 --> 1:14:37.765
I was one of the first to try a Cronut,
and it was kind of a religious experience.

1:14:37.848 --> 1:14:40.559
I went back a couple times,
then a couple times more.

1:14:40.643 --> 1:14:42.936
Now I'm always
on the hunt for the next thing,

1:14:43.021 --> 1:14:47.066
which is weird, 'cause I used to be
tenaciously old-school.

1:14:47.150 --> 1:14:50.028
Donut Pub, Peter Pan, Vesuvio's.

1:14:50.111 --> 1:14:52.613
I would make fun of people
in lines like this,

1:14:52.696 --> 1:14:56.993
but I mean, why not wait in line,
get a good treat,

1:14:57.076 --> 1:14:59.453
and meet a bunch of people
that have the same...

1:14:59.537 --> 1:15:00.788
What happened?

1:15:00.871 --> 1:15:01.872
Don't know.

1:15:01.955 --> 1:15:05.543
-You were out for a while.
-I'm just really tired. Sorry.

1:15:06.752 --> 1:15:08.254
Where did you get that?

1:15:08.337 --> 1:15:10.840
I went around the corner.
The chef was taking out the trash.

1:15:10.923 --> 1:15:14.427
I chatted him up, and I got him
to sneak a bunch of these out to me.

1:15:14.510 --> 1:15:15.636
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

1:15:15.719 --> 1:15:17.805
-These people will tear you apart.
-I'm starving.

1:15:17.888 --> 1:15:19.682
Hide that.
Don't let them see it.

1:15:22.143 --> 1:15:23.728
-I'm gonna take a little bite.
-Me too.

1:15:23.811 --> 1:15:25.896
Just a little one.
To keep my energy up.

1:15:28.983 --> 1:15:32.737
-So three of you work, you're retired?
-And I'm too old to be doing this.

1:15:32.820 --> 1:15:35.614
And you have three kids,
so this is a sacrifice and a pleasure.

1:15:35.698 --> 1:15:38.034
-Everyone needs a hobby, right?
-Here.

1:15:38.117 --> 1:15:40.911
- Where'd you get a hot dog at 7:30?
- The guy had his cart.

1:15:40.995 --> 1:15:43.581
It wasn't open, but I waved some bills,
danced around a little.

1:15:43.664 --> 1:15:46.625
Oh, God, is it really 7:30?
I have to go.

1:15:46.709 --> 1:15:49.378
-Before you get your Cro-dough-cake?
-That's the name?

1:15:49.462 --> 1:15:51.922
Breaks my heart, but my boss is in today.

1:15:52.005 --> 1:15:53.216
Good luck.

1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:57.053
Psst, hey, kid, let me hook you up.

1:15:57.970 --> 1:15:58.971
Are you kidding?

1:15:59.055 --> 1:16:01.224
-I don't kid about a Cro-dough-cake.
-Take one.

1:16:01.307 --> 1:16:03.642
Oh! Bless you. Bye.

1:16:05.936 --> 1:16:07.480
What? We had extra.

1:16:07.563 --> 1:16:09.648
I know there's a pecking order
for tennis shoes.

1:16:09.732 --> 1:16:11.692
-Yeah, totally.
-These are out of a company in LA.

1:16:11.775 --> 1:16:13.026
What else is on your wish list?

1:16:13.111 --> 1:16:14.778
I'd say any of the wear-test samples.

1:16:14.862 --> 1:16:17.698
Vintage but never worn.
Those are impossible to find.

1:16:17.782 --> 1:16:20.868
My uncle actually has a pair
of the original black and red Jordan 1s

1:16:20.951 --> 1:16:21.994
with the tag still on them.

1:16:22.078 --> 1:16:24.622
-Right, so these aren't for wearing.
-No way.

1:16:24.705 --> 1:16:26.582
Ugh, boy, does it smell
like pot over here.

1:16:26.665 --> 1:16:28.417
-Welcome back.
-Seriously, around the corner,

1:16:28.501 --> 1:16:30.586
it was like I bumped
into a nine-foot joint.

1:16:30.669 --> 1:16:32.671
People in this line
would eat that other line.

1:16:32.755 --> 1:16:34.006
-What do you have there?
-Shoes.

1:16:34.090 --> 1:16:35.924
-What shoes?
-The ones everyone's waiting for.

1:16:36.008 --> 1:16:37.926
They're pretty cool.
I think they light up.

1:16:38.010 --> 1:16:39.011
How did you get those?

1:16:39.095 --> 1:16:41.805
Marcy, the girl I gave
the Cro-dough-cake to, works there.

1:16:41.889 --> 1:16:43.307
Of course.

1:16:44.642 --> 1:16:46.560
Excuse me,
I'm working on a story for <i>GQ </i>today.

1:16:47.770 --> 1:16:50.356
-Is this our next spot?
-This was not on the agenda.

1:16:50.439 --> 1:16:52.983
-We just happened on this line?
-Let's find out what it's for.

1:16:53.066 --> 1:16:55.528
-Excuse me, what are you waiting for?
-I don't know.

1:16:55.611 --> 1:16:57.822
- Mystery?
- Definitely. Here's the front.

1:16:57.905 --> 1:16:59.740
Hey,
so what are you guys in line for?

1:16:59.823 --> 1:17:02.075
Nothing. We're just eating lunch.

1:17:03.661 --> 1:17:06.539
-They're not even waiting for stuff.
-Should we tell them?

1:17:06.622 --> 1:17:07.706
Nah.

1:17:07.790 --> 1:17:11.127
Hey, these shoes are very comfortable.

1:17:15.298 --> 1:17:17.007
So, what is this again?

1:17:17.091 --> 1:17:18.467
-Sad geeks?
-Limited-edition toys.

1:17:18.551 --> 1:17:20.969
- Do you wanna say that a little louder?
- Sorry.

1:17:21.053 --> 1:17:23.681
-It's video games, movie tie-in stuff.
-There's nothing here I want.

1:17:23.764 --> 1:17:25.558
Well, you came to hang out
with me.

1:17:25.641 --> 1:17:28.018
-Mommy's feet are sore.
-Mommy's been strong today.

1:17:28.101 --> 1:17:30.271
-Mommy is tiring.
-Head back to the hotel, Mommy.

1:17:30.354 --> 1:17:32.523
-Really?
-Yes, you were a big girl today.

1:17:32.606 --> 1:17:33.649
I have some work to do.

1:17:33.732 --> 1:17:35.859
Go do it, and take a bath
and order room service.

1:17:35.943 --> 1:17:37.403
-I won't be long.
-Okay, good.

1:17:37.486 --> 1:17:39.530
-Ooh, nice costumes.
-Thanks.

1:17:49.290 --> 1:17:51.292
Hi. Did I fall asleep?

1:17:51.375 --> 1:17:53.043
I guess I fell asleep.

1:17:53.126 --> 1:17:57.256
Oh, great hotel. Great bed.
No Lifetime channel.

1:17:57.340 --> 1:18:00.133
Good room service, though.
Twenty-four hours.

1:18:00.218 --> 1:18:02.803
You hungry?
Wow, you look weird. What's wrong?

1:18:03.429 --> 1:18:04.472
I slept with a Wookiee!

1:18:05.181 --> 1:18:07.516
-Come again?
-I slept with a Wookiee.

1:18:09.185 --> 1:18:10.978
-You slept with a--
-Wookiee! Wookiee!

1:18:11.061 --> 1:18:13.272
I slept with a Wookiee!
Don't make me keep saying it.

1:18:13.356 --> 1:18:14.857
I'm sorry. I'm not getting this.

1:18:14.940 --> 1:18:17.735
-I was in that collectibles line.
-Nothing good can follow that.

1:18:17.818 --> 1:18:21.614
And I was interviewing people,
and then, you know, the line moved up,

1:18:21.697 --> 1:18:23.491
and I kind of bonded with this one group,

1:18:23.574 --> 1:18:25.576
and I tagged along with them
to P.J. Clarke's.

1:18:25.659 --> 1:18:27.411
We had burgers, and drinks,
and more drinks,

1:18:27.495 --> 1:18:29.580
-and then there was this guy--
-The Wookiee?

1:18:29.663 --> 1:18:31.415
A guy dressed in a Wookiee costume.

1:18:31.499 --> 1:18:33.083
-He wasn't a Wookiee.
-Got it. Go on.

1:18:33.166 --> 1:18:35.711
He was nice.
I was laughing. He was laughing.

1:18:35.794 --> 1:18:37.755
They have that very deep laugh.

1:18:37.838 --> 1:18:39.548
-He was laughing in his own voice.
-Mmm.

1:18:39.632 --> 1:18:41.217
He invited me back to his place.

1:18:41.300 --> 1:18:43.344
And if you say,
"Did you take the Millennium Falcon?"

1:18:43.427 --> 1:18:44.845
-I'll smack you.
-I said nothing.

1:18:44.928 --> 1:18:46.847
-I can't believe this.
-Calm down...

1:18:46.930 --> 1:18:49.892
A one-night stand.
I just had a one-night stand. My first.

1:18:49.975 --> 1:18:51.935
It's a one-night stand
if you don't see him again.

1:18:52.019 --> 1:18:54.605
-Will you see him again?
-He was wearing a Wookiee costume.

1:18:54.688 --> 1:18:57.816
-No, I won't see him again.
-That seems a little harsh.

1:18:57.900 --> 1:18:58.901
A one-night stand.

1:18:58.984 --> 1:19:01.487
I'm 32, and I'm only now having
a one-night stand?

1:19:01.570 --> 1:19:02.780
It's your first one, huh?

1:19:02.863 --> 1:19:03.864
-Yes.
-Wow.

1:19:03.947 --> 1:19:05.824
-Why?
-I thought that's what college was for.

1:19:05.908 --> 1:19:08.744
Exactly. I'm behind.
I mean, how many have you had?

1:19:08.827 --> 1:19:10.120
-Wookiees?
-One-night stands.

1:19:10.203 --> 1:19:11.330
-Oh. None.
-None?

1:19:11.414 --> 1:19:13.040
-Yeah, none.
-How can that be?

1:19:13.123 --> 1:19:16.919
Well, mom at 16, for starters.
Hot in <i>Outlander,</i> but elsewhere...

1:19:17.002 --> 1:19:20.381
And I had you, and rules,
and work, and rules.

1:19:20.464 --> 1:19:22.508
I had a couple three-night stands,
if that helps.

1:19:22.591 --> 1:19:24.552
Oh, perfect.
I'm behind on everything.

1:19:24.635 --> 1:19:26.345
- No, you're not.
- Really?

1:19:26.429 --> 1:19:28.180
I have no career, no apartment,

1:19:28.264 --> 1:19:30.808
but boy, oh boy,
can I bang out a one-night stand.

1:19:30.891 --> 1:19:33.644
-You're too hard on yourself.
-My love life is a disaster.

1:19:33.727 --> 1:19:35.145
Did you not break up with Pete yet?

1:19:35.229 --> 1:19:37.606
I'm not talking about him.
I'm talking about...

1:19:38.106 --> 1:19:39.275
Who?

1:19:39.358 --> 1:19:41.444
-You know.
-No, who?

1:19:41.527 --> 1:19:43.487
-You know.
-No, I don't know.

1:19:43.571 --> 1:19:45.489
-Logan.
-Huntzberger?

1:19:46.073 --> 1:19:48.117
-You really didn't know?
-No. Since when?

1:19:48.200 --> 1:19:49.993
Whenever I'm in London,
I stay with him.

1:19:50.077 --> 1:19:52.830
-So there's no Didi?
-He's Didi.

1:19:52.913 --> 1:19:54.457
Logan Huntzberger.

1:19:54.540 --> 1:19:56.917
I thought he was engaged
to that French heiress.

1:19:57.418 --> 1:19:59.295
-He is.
-Oh.

1:19:59.378 --> 1:20:01.380
They don't live together.
She lives in Paris.

1:20:01.464 --> 1:20:04.467
- But they're engaged.
- Yes.

1:20:04.550 --> 1:20:06.802
-And they're getting married.
-Yes.

1:20:06.885 --> 1:20:10.013
Well,
if it makes you feel any better,

1:20:10.097 --> 1:20:11.682
that's sluttier than a one-night stand.

1:20:11.765 --> 1:20:13.559
-That helps. Thanks.
-Does Patrick know?

1:20:13.642 --> 1:20:17.020
Paul! Paul! His name is Paul!
And he doesn't know.

1:20:17.104 --> 1:20:18.105
All right, calm down.

1:20:18.188 --> 1:20:20.816
I'm blowing everything.
My life, my career...

1:20:20.899 --> 1:20:24.528
I'm flailing, and I don't have
a plan, or a list, or a clue.

1:20:24.612 --> 1:20:25.654
This is karma.

1:20:25.738 --> 1:20:28.115
This is why Condé Nast
will not follow up with me.

1:20:28.198 --> 1:20:30.576
They know failure
when it walks in the door.

1:20:30.659 --> 1:20:34.121
I never found my lucky outfit.
I needed it. It gives me confidence.

1:20:34.204 --> 1:20:36.540
-What is your lucky outfit?
-Red dress, full skirt.

1:20:36.624 --> 1:20:39.460
- That's in my closet.
- Are you kidding me?

1:20:39.543 --> 1:20:41.294
No! It looks cute with boots.

1:20:41.379 --> 1:20:44.172
Mom, you knew
I was looking for that outfit.

1:20:44.256 --> 1:20:46.008
Really? That red?
It'll wash you out.

1:20:46.091 --> 1:20:48.301
So, not only
did you steal my lucky outfit,

1:20:48.386 --> 1:20:51.430
you've now ruined the image
I had of me in my outfit.

1:20:51.514 --> 1:20:52.640
Thanks a lot.

1:20:53.391 --> 1:20:54.808
Come here. Sit.

1:20:57.603 --> 1:20:59.480
What is happening here?

1:20:59.563 --> 1:21:01.064
This isn't you.

1:21:01.148 --> 1:21:02.608
Panicking, lying...

1:21:02.691 --> 1:21:05.193
-I didn't lie.
-Ah, you didn't tell me about Logan.

1:21:05.277 --> 1:21:07.696
-What's with not telling me about stuff?
-I don't know.

1:21:07.780 --> 1:21:10.908
-Why didn't you tell me about Logan?
-I don't know. I just...

1:21:10.991 --> 1:21:13.786
I'm feeling very lost these days.

1:21:13.869 --> 1:21:16.538
This whole past year,
it's like the ground's made of straw.

1:21:16.622 --> 1:21:18.081
I'm just gonna fall through.

1:21:18.165 --> 1:21:20.459
Look, life has been
pretty good to you so far.

1:21:20.543 --> 1:21:23.587
It was your turn for a few curveballs.
Peaks and valleys, kid.

1:21:23.671 --> 1:21:25.297
The older you get, the more you have.

1:21:25.381 --> 1:21:27.215
That whole line story was so stupid.

1:21:27.299 --> 1:21:29.427
I did it because
they thought it was interesting.

1:21:29.510 --> 1:21:31.762
I didn't have a beat on it.
I didn't feel it.

1:21:31.845 --> 1:21:34.723
I'm just a big, fat,
Wookiee-humping loser with no future.

1:21:34.807 --> 1:21:38.602
Wait. What about that website?
The one that's been after you forever,

1:21:38.686 --> 1:21:40.353
begging you to come work for them?

1:21:40.437 --> 1:21:42.439
-BrendaBlabs?
-<i>SandeeSays</i>.

1:21:42.523 --> 1:21:43.524
Go there.

1:21:43.607 --> 1:21:44.942
-Have you seen it?
-Who cares?

1:21:45.025 --> 1:21:47.194
Go. Work. Be wanted.
Be adored.

1:21:47.277 --> 1:21:49.530
So it's not the <i>Washington Post.</i>
You're young.

1:21:49.613 --> 1:21:50.739
I'm not so young.

1:21:50.823 --> 1:21:53.158
Hey! I'm young. You're young.
Case closed.

1:21:53.241 --> 1:21:55.411
-Yeah.
-Give them a call.

1:21:55.494 --> 1:21:57.538
You haven't had
anything steady in forever.

1:21:57.621 --> 1:21:59.331
Stay in one place for a while.

1:21:59.415 --> 1:22:02.793
Plus they've been stalking you.
That feels good a little, doesn't it?

1:22:03.376 --> 1:22:06.129
Yeah. It's flattering.

1:22:06.213 --> 1:22:08.132
So, give them a call.

1:22:08.632 --> 1:22:11.969
-I will give them a call.
-Want me to order some comfort food?

1:22:12.052 --> 1:22:14.972
Some pot roast, mashed potatoes,
banana split?

1:22:15.055 --> 1:22:16.389
Sure.

1:22:16.474 --> 1:22:19.142
I'm gonna take a shower,
get the Wookiee smell off me.

1:22:19.226 --> 1:22:21.479
Wait, seriously.
Did he leave the outfit on?

1:22:22.354 --> 1:22:24.106
That's a conversation for another day.

1:22:24.189 --> 1:22:25.357
Can that day be tomorrow?

1:22:25.441 --> 1:22:28.527
Don't leave me and my imagination
alone with that for too long!

1:22:28.611 --> 1:22:30.613
Order!

1:22:32.448 --> 1:22:34.116
Here we are, the nerve center.

1:22:34.199 --> 1:22:37.244
-Very cool. Simple.
-Oh, we don't decorate much.

1:22:37.327 --> 1:22:39.705
We're expanding so fast,
there's no reason to.

1:22:39.788 --> 1:22:41.373
We'll outgrow this place in a month.

1:22:41.457 --> 1:22:43.626
I don't waste money.
My CFO appreciates it.

1:22:43.709 --> 1:22:45.878
-Say hello to her. This is Patrice.
-Hi, Patrice.

1:22:45.961 --> 1:22:47.754
Rory Gilmore.
The one I was telling you about.

1:22:47.838 --> 1:22:50.257
We have no individual offices.
Not even me.

1:22:50.340 --> 1:22:51.592
We work best in a hive,

1:22:51.675 --> 1:22:53.719
buzzing around each other,
making word honey.

1:22:53.802 --> 1:22:54.845
Interesting.

1:22:54.928 --> 1:22:58.223
When you come in, you grab
the nearest spot at the communal table.

1:22:58.306 --> 1:23:01.309
-No hierarchy.
-And together we storm the barricades.

1:23:01.393 --> 1:23:02.394
Exactly.

1:23:02.478 --> 1:23:05.523
Uh, so I didn't know I'd be getting
a tour from Sandee herself.

1:23:05.606 --> 1:23:07.065
I thought my first stop would be HR.

1:23:07.149 --> 1:23:09.485
Oh, HR still means homeroom
to half the peeps here.

1:23:09.568 --> 1:23:11.361
We don't even have it.
Come, sit.

1:23:12.195 --> 1:23:13.906
-Okay.
-Need Red Bull.

1:23:13.989 --> 1:23:17.034
-So, let's do this.
-Yes.

1:23:17.117 --> 1:23:19.411
That is why I'm here.
Should I have brought my laptop?

1:23:19.495 --> 1:23:20.829
Well, first things first.

1:23:20.913 --> 1:23:24.542
If I take a chance on Rory Gilmore,
what am I getting?

1:23:24.625 --> 1:23:26.669
-What?
-If I hire you,

1:23:26.752 --> 1:23:29.505
tell me what Rory Gilmore
would write about for <i>SandeeSays</i>.

1:23:30.297 --> 1:23:32.007
Oh. If I worked here?

1:23:32.090 --> 1:23:33.509
Sell me.

1:23:34.301 --> 1:23:37.012
Sell? Okay, we're selling. Um...

1:23:37.095 --> 1:23:39.431
-That's a totally different outfit.
-Hmm?

1:23:39.515 --> 1:23:42.350
Um, if I worked here,
you'd be getting the person

1:23:42.434 --> 1:23:44.227
who wrote
the <i>New Yorker</i> article you liked.

1:23:44.311 --> 1:23:47.189
Yeah, but that's the <i>New Yorker.</i>
We're not the <i>New Yorker.</i>

1:23:47.272 --> 1:23:49.149
Look around, everyone's got their hair.

1:23:49.232 --> 1:23:50.901
Oh, right.

1:23:50.984 --> 1:23:54.572
Um, sorry.
I just didn't have a pitch prepared.

1:23:54.655 --> 1:23:56.949
That's a little weird.
Thought you'd bring some ideas.

1:23:57.032 --> 1:23:59.284
Don't get me wrong. I have ideas.

1:23:59.952 --> 1:24:00.953
Like?

1:24:02.370 --> 1:24:07.292
Um, stuff about the world, uh...
culture...

1:24:07.375 --> 1:24:09.002
Pretty generic.
You got anything specific?

1:24:09.086 --> 1:24:10.796
-You want specifics.
-I'd love some.

1:24:10.879 --> 1:24:12.005
Well, let's see.

1:24:12.089 --> 1:24:16.719
There could be something in, um,
girls who go to Comic-Con type things

1:24:16.802 --> 1:24:18.679
and sleep with characters.

1:24:18.762 --> 1:24:20.347
Character-loving girls.

1:24:20.430 --> 1:24:22.182
That sounds obscure.
Very made-up.

1:24:22.265 --> 1:24:23.559
Yes, it does.

1:24:23.642 --> 1:24:25.853
So you're talking about loser girls.

1:24:25.936 --> 1:24:28.396
Like, they get drunk
and they do something stupid.

1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:30.399
We've done that story a bunch of times.

1:24:30.482 --> 1:24:32.484
Different takes on it.
I thought you knew our site.

1:24:32.568 --> 1:24:36.238
Oh, I do. And you're right.
I wouldn't want to repeat that.

1:24:41.744 --> 1:24:42.786
Oh, shoot.

1:24:42.869 --> 1:24:45.622
Ugh, I've just been called
into an emergency meeting.

1:24:49.334 --> 1:24:52.004
-Hello?
<i>-So, hi, it's Sandee.</i>

1:24:52.087 --> 1:24:53.421
Hello.

1:24:53.505 --> 1:24:55.382
Really appreciate you coming in
for the job,

1:24:55.465 --> 1:24:57.134
but I've decided
we're gonna go internal.

1:24:57.217 --> 1:24:58.093
What?

1:24:58.176 --> 1:25:01.471
On the staff writing job, we're going
with one of our veterans, Kaitlynn.

1:25:01.554 --> 1:25:04.224
-She's been here two months.
-But it's an editing job.

1:25:04.307 --> 1:25:07.060
<i>Oh, wow, no.</i>
<i>We're really picky about those.</i>

1:25:07.144 --> 1:25:10.022
-You basically promised me the job.
-You were a candidate.

1:25:10.105 --> 1:25:12.566
What about "we gotta have
Rory Gilmore's voice at <i>SandeeSays</i>"?

1:25:12.650 --> 1:25:15.819
-You've been saying that for a year.
-I think Kaitlynn's going to be that.

1:25:15.902 --> 1:25:18.280
Kaitlynn is going to be the voice
of Rory Gilmore?

1:25:18.363 --> 1:25:20.157
-Are you high?
-Don't be hostile.

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:23.285
-I'm a little pissed here.
-I get it. You got your hopes up.

1:25:23.368 --> 1:25:26.413
No, you got my hopes up.
For a job that I didn't even want.

1:25:26.496 --> 1:25:27.831
<i>Oh, real nice.</i>

1:25:27.915 --> 1:25:30.834
-So you just felt like wasting my time.
-No, you wasted my time.

1:25:30.918 --> 1:25:33.712
Hey, I'm the CEO here.
My time's a little more valuable.

1:25:33.796 --> 1:25:34.838
And another thing.

1:25:34.922 --> 1:25:37.340
It's weird that you have
three different cell numbers.

1:25:37.424 --> 1:25:40.343
-Super weird.
-It's not. One is a work-only phone.

1:25:40.427 --> 1:25:42.596
The other's family-only,
except when I'm in Stars Hollow

1:25:42.680 --> 1:25:45.307
and there's no reception,
so I use the family phone for work.

1:25:45.390 --> 1:25:46.642
The other one is for friends,

1:25:46.725 --> 1:25:49.978
