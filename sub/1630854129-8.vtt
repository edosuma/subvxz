WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:05.875
It's a tricky thing,
bringing down a dirty cop.

00:07.746 --> 00:09.531
If he has information,
that makes him an asset.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.881
An asset?

00:11.881 --> 00:14.318
<i>The guy almost got Stella
and me killed!</i>

00:14.318 --> 00:15.798
I want his head on a pike!

00:15.798 --> 00:17.713
You just cost me a useful CI.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.019
Danny Kavanaugh.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.368
Got what he deserved.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.722
Did you watch
the game last night?

00:26.722 --> 00:28.202
Uh, no, I--

00:28.202 --> 00:32.032
I was working,
you know, the bar we co-own.

00:32.032 --> 00:34.077
Too bad.
Hell of a fourth quarter.

00:36.210 --> 00:38.560
Whoa, jeez!
Hey, are you blind, pal?

00:38.560 --> 00:39.952
What?

00:39.952 --> 00:41.389
The guy, he just blasted
through this stop sign

00:41.389 --> 00:43.608
like it wasn't even there.

00:43.608 --> 00:45.001
Kids these days

00:45.001 --> 00:49.310
learn their driving skills
from "Grand Theft Auto."

00:49.310 --> 00:51.094
I got a half a mind
to start, you know,

00:51.094 --> 00:53.183
making citizen's arrests.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.142
This is happening
way too often.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.622
So it's next weekend?

00:57.622 --> 01:00.495
Yeah, I'm just gonna
drive up for the day.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.496
Oh.

01:04.238 --> 01:07.763
In my head, these CFD
leadership conferences

01:07.763 --> 01:10.809
are just a bunch
of guys smoking cigars,

01:10.809 --> 01:13.029
drinking scotch,
patting themselves on the back.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.552
Not exactly.

01:14.552 --> 01:16.554
But you'll find out
soon enough.

01:16.554 --> 01:19.166
You have a year of being
a lieutenant under your belt,

01:19.166 --> 01:21.559
and I'm sure you'll get
an invite next year.

01:21.559 --> 01:23.083
Oh, I will practice
my cigar puffing.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.651
<i>All units, vehicle fire,
Chicago and LaSalle.</i>

01:40.143 --> 01:41.536
Let's move!

01:43.233 --> 01:44.800
The exits are blocked.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.411
All right, let's evacuate
this bus and douse that fire.

01:47.411 --> 01:49.587
Deal with the
compressed natural gas.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.155
There's enough fuel up there
to level a building.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.461
Hey, hey, Herrmann.

01:53.461 --> 01:54.897
Let's get some water
on those tanks.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.159
Hey, Ritter, two lines.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.421
You cool the tanks,

01:57.421 --> 01:58.683
I'll hit the fire.
- Copy that.

01:58.683 --> 02:00.685
Hey, back up.
You're not gonna fit.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.296
Hey, back up, man!

02:02.296 --> 02:03.601
Hey, hey!

02:03.601 --> 02:05.864
That relieve valve's gonna go!
Watch out!

02:19.530 --> 02:20.923
Squad!

02:20.923 --> 02:22.446
Let's get that windshield out. Hey.

02:22.446 --> 02:23.926
Get those people back, okay?

02:23.926 --> 02:26.494
If that tank goes,
the whole block goes.

02:26.494 --> 02:28.191
Let's move.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.498
Carver, get me a head count
in the bus.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.195
Okay.

02:33.718 --> 02:36.504
I count six plus the driver.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.027
Come on!

02:38.027 --> 02:39.637
Herrmann, let's get
those hose lines!

02:39.637 --> 02:40.856
On it!

02:40.856 --> 02:42.945
Hurry up
with that windshield!

02:42.945 --> 02:45.643
Right from the bottom.

02:45.643 --> 02:46.862
Push. Push it up.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.735
We're not getting
enough water on those tanks.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.955
Mouch, give me a ladder.
- Copy.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.348
Careful, guys. It's heavy.

02:54.348 --> 02:57.046
Right behind ya.
Okay, I'll push up.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.527
Come on.
Come on, I got you.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.839
Is there anyone else
in there?

03:07.839 --> 03:09.841
One more. Way in back.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.843
All right, Gallo, Carver,
you're going in.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.976
Mask up.
- Copy.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.590
Fire's coming
through the back wall.

03:19.590 --> 03:20.722
Hey, clear out the victim.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.767
We'll get a line in there.
- Copy.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.294
Ready, Lieutenant.

03:30.558 --> 03:34.257
Fire department, call out!

03:34.257 --> 03:35.258
Hose line.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.439
I got him!

03:42.439 --> 03:43.919
We've located the victim.

03:43.919 --> 03:47.270
Male, 40s, unconscious.

03:48.489 --> 03:49.751
Get in there!

03:49.751 --> 03:50.969
We're gonna do
a webbing sling,

03:50.969 --> 03:52.275
drag him back the way we came.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.624
You watch his limbs
to make sure he doesn't

03:53.624 --> 03:56.236
get caught on anything.
- That'll take too long.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.412
- What?
- Let's go out the window.

04:04.635 --> 04:05.810
You need a hand?

04:09.684 --> 04:11.555
Give him a hand!

04:13.818 --> 04:14.950
You got him?

04:21.043 --> 04:22.349
Get it now!

04:26.004 --> 04:27.484
Hose line!

04:33.751 --> 04:35.144
Okay, we're good!

04:40.062 --> 04:41.759
Oh, looks worse than it is,
but you can never be

04:41.759 --> 04:43.370
too careful with a head injury.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.197
Could you take him
to Children's Hospital?

04:45.197 --> 04:46.329
It just would make me feel
a lot better.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.331
Yeah, sure, we can do that.

04:52.074 --> 04:54.642
Hell of a move, Gallo.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.644
It was quick thinking.

04:56.644 --> 04:59.473
I just wanted to get
far away as fast as possible.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.181
Why do I feel like
we just defused a bomb?

05:12.181 --> 05:14.401
Because we basically did.

05:14.401 --> 05:17.404
Calls like that
are why I joined the CFD.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.717
- Look who it is.
- How are you, Kelly?

05:26.717 --> 05:28.415
I'm all right.

05:28.415 --> 05:30.025
I never know if it's
good news or bad news

05:30.025 --> 05:31.374
when I see your face.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.377
Say, listen, you, uh--

05:34.377 --> 05:36.074
you have anything
going on after shift?

05:36.074 --> 05:38.120
I don't know, why?

05:38.120 --> 05:40.209
You were pretty helpful
in that safe cracker case.

05:40.209 --> 05:41.602
It was a nice assist.

05:41.602 --> 05:43.038
Assist?

05:43.038 --> 05:45.301
My recollection is,
I solved it for you.

05:47.259 --> 05:50.088
We got another situation
that could use your expertise.

05:50.088 --> 05:51.699
Fire scene?

05:51.699 --> 05:54.179
Not exactly.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.051
Meet me there
if you got the time.

06:04.233 --> 06:06.061
Hey, Gallo,
can I talk to you?

06:06.061 --> 06:08.193
Yeah, sure.

06:14.199 --> 06:15.723
What's up, Carver?

06:15.723 --> 06:17.768
I just want to know
if you're gonna make a habit

06:17.768 --> 06:19.901
of winging it out there
and leaving the rest

06:19.901 --> 06:21.946
of us to play catch-up.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.034
What are you talking about?

06:23.034 --> 06:24.166
I had my webbing out.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.603
I was telling you the plan.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.083
But I had a better plan.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.911
And lucky for us, it worked.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.391
But what if that window held

06:31.391 --> 06:32.914
and you're messing around
with it instead of following

06:32.914 --> 06:34.655
the instructions
I already gave you?

06:34.655 --> 06:36.178
Am I supposed
to take orders from you?

06:36.178 --> 06:38.702
You're not my lieutenant.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.574
I got more years
on the job than you.

06:40.574 --> 06:43.403
Well, I got more years
than you on Truck 81, by a lot.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.579
Kidd is my third officer
on the same rig,

06:45.579 --> 06:47.319
so I'm gonna take
my orders from her,

06:47.319 --> 06:49.757
if that's--
if that's cool with you.

06:49.757 --> 06:52.455
Gallo,
this is a dangerous job,

06:52.455 --> 06:55.240
not some extreme sport
for you to get your kicks.

06:55.240 --> 06:57.460
I don't mind working
alongside some excitable kid,

06:57.460 --> 06:59.462
but you need to know when
to quit playing superhero

06:59.462 --> 07:01.116
and maybe listen
to someone who's seen

07:01.116 --> 07:02.596
a lot worse stuff than you.

07:04.685 --> 07:07.775
You know, Carver,
I did nothing but welcome you

07:07.775 --> 07:09.298
to 51 with open arms.

07:09.298 --> 07:12.475
Tried everything I could
to get to know you better.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.782
What a waste of time that was.

07:23.007 --> 07:26.794
Listen, I want in, but I'm
not doing the clown thing.

07:26.794 --> 07:28.056
How about I dress up
like a magician?

07:28.056 --> 07:29.797
I could pull lots of
scarves out of my mouth.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.320
Why can't you
make things easy

07:31.320 --> 07:33.322
and get in the clown costume
with the rest

07:33.322 --> 07:34.628
of the volunteers?

07:34.628 --> 07:36.064
I have a
legitimate condition.

07:36.064 --> 07:38.370
It's in the medical books. Cowlrophobia.

07:38.370 --> 07:41.765
Uh, coulrophobia, actually.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.811
Yeah. It's real.

07:43.811 --> 07:44.812
It's very, very real.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.596
Fine, be a magician.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.731
Here you go, guys.

07:50.731 --> 07:51.993
I got this.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.429
People always think
I'm making it up.

07:53.429 --> 07:57.259
I had a clown walk
into my bar a few weeks ago,

07:57.259 --> 07:59.653
which I realize sounds like
the set-up

07:59.653 --> 08:01.524
to a really bad joke,
but it was Halloween,

08:01.524 --> 08:03.091
and I had to hide

08:03.091 --> 08:04.527
in the storage room
until he left.

08:04.527 --> 08:05.876
You think that's bad,
how about

08:05.876 --> 08:07.530
an entire kindergarten class
of clowns

08:07.530 --> 08:09.097
showing up at my firehouse?
- No.

08:09.097 --> 08:11.012
- Yes.
- Wow.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.535
What firehouse
do you work out of?

08:12.535 --> 08:14.842
51 over on Blue Island.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.365
Did you say that
you own a bar?

08:16.365 --> 08:17.540
Yeah.

08:17.540 --> 08:20.021
Yeah,
Foreman's in Logan Square.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.805
You guys should
come by sometime.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.981
And you volunteer here?

08:23.981 --> 08:26.070
Coming up
on my third year, yeah.

08:26.070 --> 08:29.421
The nurses
are still mean to me.

08:29.421 --> 08:31.293
Do you--

08:31.293 --> 08:34.905
did you know Evan Hawkins?

08:34.905 --> 08:37.386
I did.

08:37.386 --> 08:38.909
I did, yeah.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.914
Are you Violet?

08:48.179 --> 08:50.355
This is the guy that Evan
wanted to set you up with,

08:50.355 --> 08:51.748
Brett, you remember?

08:51.748 --> 08:55.056
He owns a bar,
and he volunteers here.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.710
Oh, wow.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.363
Dylan, Barbara
said they're starting

08:58.363 --> 08:59.451
reading time upstairs.

08:59.451 --> 09:00.801
Okay, thanks.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.935
Well, it was really nice
to meet you guys.

09:06.502 --> 09:09.549
And I'm so sorry about Evan.
It's such a huge loss.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.594
Thank you, Dylan.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.823
All right, let's wrap it up.

09:22.823 --> 09:25.042
Mouch, you help me
with these ropes.

09:25.042 --> 09:27.610
Gallo, Carver,
put the ladder away.

09:27.610 --> 09:28.916
You got it, Lieutenant.

09:34.486 --> 09:35.662
Shoulder carry or suitcase?

09:37.489 --> 09:38.403
I don't care.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.498
Suitcase then.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.326
We're going maybe 20 feet.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.943
There something
going on with those two?

09:55.943 --> 09:57.814
Not that I'm aware of.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.694
Hey. Hey!

10:07.694 --> 10:09.478
What are you doing?

10:09.478 --> 10:11.741
You see? You see?

10:11.741 --> 10:13.743
Uh, Herrmann has a new
bee in his bonnet.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.702
Apparently,
there's an uptick in people

10:15.702 --> 10:17.704
ignoring the stop sign.
- Ha!

10:17.704 --> 10:20.445
No, it's nothing short
of the breaking down

10:20.445 --> 10:22.056
of society, boys, all right?

10:22.056 --> 10:24.798
Let me tell you,
Generation Z...

10:24.798 --> 10:26.190
Okay, where is this going?

10:26.190 --> 10:29.803
They have no respect
for safety, stop signs,

10:29.803 --> 10:31.805
or basic common decency.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.851
Okay, so exactly where
I thought this was going.

10:34.851 --> 10:37.680
I didn't mean you, all right?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.334
You know what I'm saying.

10:39.334 --> 10:40.422
I don't, actually.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.684
Doesn't matter.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.773
The point is,
I'm gonna do something

10:43.773 --> 10:45.775
to restore order around here.

10:45.775 --> 10:48.299
I mean, that is a stop sign.

10:48.299 --> 10:54.741
Has one simple instruction
on it--stop.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.874
People are gonna
start respecting it.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.790
And how exactly are you
going to make them?

11:02.879 --> 11:05.882
I'm kicking around
a couple ideas.

11:26.555 --> 11:27.556
Pryma?

11:27.556 --> 11:29.036
Over here.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.777
Nice place you got here.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.040
Yeah, right.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.216
A few nights ago,
CPD got a report

11:35.216 --> 11:38.523
of repeated loud explosions
coming from this address.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.874
They rolled out a squad car,
but it was a ghost town

11:40.874 --> 11:42.571
by the time they arrived.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.443
It was probably just some
kids screwing with M80s

11:45.443 --> 11:47.576
or detonating Tannerite.

11:47.576 --> 11:49.230
Yeah?

11:49.230 --> 11:50.753
What do you think about this?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.675
I don't know.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.285
But can you figure it out?

12:01.285 --> 12:06.029
Maybe, but you must know
someone more qualified.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.509
I'm trying
to chase down the lead

12:07.509 --> 12:09.903
without making too much fuss.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.426
Start getting
certain people involved,

12:11.426 --> 12:13.776
the next thing you know,
ATF is swooping in

12:13.776 --> 12:15.604
and taking over the case.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.214
The ATF?

12:17.214 --> 12:20.130
What is this lead
you're chasing down?

12:21.828 --> 12:23.090
There's a certain
individual we've

12:23.090 --> 12:25.570
had our eye on for a while.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.921
POD cameras picked up
his car just up the street

12:27.921 --> 12:32.012
at Pulaski and 31st
on the night in question.

12:32.012 --> 12:34.057
This guy had anything
to do with this,

12:34.057 --> 12:35.537
we need to know about it.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.672
Okay, well, I'll take a look.
See if I can figure it out.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.196
I appreciate it.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.549
Dylan is really cute,
isn't he?

12:47.549 --> 12:49.290
The way you guys connected
over the clown thing,

12:49.290 --> 12:51.771
and the way he smiled
when you were leaving?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.729
I think he was smiling
at both of us.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.731
Mm-mm, no.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.864
It really did feel like the
two of you had a connection.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.126
Oh, I don't know about that,

12:59.126 --> 13:01.606
but he does seem like
a good guy.

13:01.606 --> 13:04.174
It was the strangest feeling
realizing who he was.

13:07.699 --> 13:11.007
Honestly, for a second,
I kind of felt like Evan

13:11.007 --> 13:12.835
was in the room with us.

13:14.315 --> 13:17.579
Yeah, I know what you mean.

13:17.579 --> 13:20.974
It was a crazy coincidence.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.063
You should call Dylan.

13:23.063 --> 13:25.152
I don't know.
That seems a little aggressive.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.110
I mean, I didn't
pick up on any vibe.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.852
He did invite us
to the bar, so we could--

13:29.852 --> 13:32.115
we could go there sometime.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.901
Yeah. Okay. Maybe.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.685
I thought Carver
was spending more time

13:36.685 --> 13:38.121
at Molly's these days.

13:38.121 --> 13:40.994
So where is he?

13:40.994 --> 13:42.517
Who cares?

13:46.434 --> 13:48.523
Scarecrow.

13:48.523 --> 13:50.351
Cowardly Lion.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.266
- What?
- Why'd you say Scarecrow?

13:55.443 --> 13:57.880
You okay, buddy?

13:57.880 --> 14:00.709
I need to borrow
your motorcycle.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.058
Okay.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.494
Hey, Gallo.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.235
Can you meet me at the end
of the bar for a second?

14:05.235 --> 14:07.977
- Sure thing.
- Cool.

14:10.632 --> 14:13.374
What's going on
with you and Carver?

14:13.374 --> 14:14.854
Ask him.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.639
He's not here,
so I'm asking you.

14:17.639 --> 14:22.426
Well, that's kind of
the problem, I guess.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.037
What is that
supposed to mean?

14:24.037 --> 14:26.082
Carver always
gets a free pass.

14:26.082 --> 14:27.344
I don't know.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.824
He comes out of nowhere
with the big seal

14:28.824 --> 14:30.652
of approval from Boden.

14:30.652 --> 14:33.220
You don't ask me or Mouch
what we think of him.

14:33.220 --> 14:35.178
You just hire him on the spot.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.572
Hell, you don't even bring
the hammer down on him

14:37.572 --> 14:39.269
when he ends up
in the drunk tank.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.576
You bail him out
and chauffeur him home.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.926
No wonder he struts around
like he owns the place,

14:43.926 --> 14:45.928
because he basically does.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.553
He wasn't wrong about
a lot of that stuff.

15:02.553 --> 15:05.252
I mean, Boden foisted
Carver onto me,

15:05.252 --> 15:08.081
and then I foisted him
onto Gallo and Mouch.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.343
That's how it works.

15:09.343 --> 15:10.953
Gallo and Mouch
don't get a vote.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.477
I could have maybe
handled it better, though.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.262
I don't want Gallo
feeling resentful.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.350
Who cares?

15:16.350 --> 15:17.699
Gallo can feel
however he wants,

15:17.699 --> 15:19.831
so long as he shows up
on time and does his job.

15:19.831 --> 15:25.272
That is quite the management
philosophy you got there.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.490
It works for me.

15:29.015 --> 15:31.495
You getting anywhere
with this?

15:31.495 --> 15:32.888
I got some ideas.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.846
It's taking a lot of legwork.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.763
Well, doesn't Pryma
have somebody who's

15:38.763 --> 15:41.897
supposed to know this stuff?

15:41.897 --> 15:45.988
He came to me trying
to fly under the radar.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.555
Or so he says.

15:47.555 --> 15:50.862
I mean, there's definitely
something he's not telling me.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.864
Why work with him then?

15:52.864 --> 15:55.345
Eh, it's interesting stuff.

15:55.345 --> 15:58.653
Must be.
It's gonna make us late.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.916
Mm-hmm.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.619
Sylvie.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.534
Dylan, hey.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.753
Are you here to see Violet?

16:11.753 --> 16:14.582
No, no, actually,
I'm here to see you.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.323
Oh.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.934
Hi.
- Hi.

16:18.934 --> 16:22.111
You mentioned you worked here,
so I figured I'd stop by

16:22.111 --> 16:24.287
and make sure
those little clown kids

16:24.287 --> 16:25.897
aren't still lurking around.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.509
No, they're probably
at a group therapy session

16:28.509 --> 16:29.901
'cause as soon as I saw them,

16:29.901 --> 16:31.512
I screamed in their faces
and ran away.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.644
Well, that'll teach them.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.212
Yeah.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.388
I hope it's not weird,
me just showing up,

16:38.388 --> 16:40.869
but I wanted to ask,

16:40.869 --> 16:45.004
do you want
to grab a drink sometime?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.354
Or lunch?

16:47.354 --> 16:48.572
Or coffee?

16:48.572 --> 16:49.530
But that's as low as I'll go.

16:49.530 --> 16:52.185
Um.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.623
Yeah. Yeah.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.104
Coffee sometime would be nice. Sure.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.367
Here, you can put your number
in my phone,

17:00.367 --> 17:01.933
and I'll give you a call.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.631
Sounds great. Cool.

17:07.287 --> 17:09.071
Great. Yeah.

17:10.899 --> 17:12.944
Oh, wow.

17:16.165 --> 17:19.473
Well, I told you that smile
wasn't for the both of us.

17:19.473 --> 17:20.778
You're gonna call him, right?

17:22.606 --> 17:25.087
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.398
Oh, so that's
what you're doing.

17:31.398 --> 17:33.095
Oh, hey.

17:33.095 --> 17:37.012
Well, you know, when ancient
farmers weren't around

17:37.012 --> 17:39.754
to shoo the crows
out of the fields,

17:39.754 --> 17:43.105
ancestors of ours
made a brilliant invention.

17:43.105 --> 17:46.500
You know,
to keep the pests away.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.110
Voila!

17:48.110 --> 17:49.416
The scarecrow.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.984
Or the scarecop, if you will.

17:52.984 --> 17:54.725
Huh.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.388
You see?

18:05.388 --> 18:08.348
Well, I'll be.

18:08.348 --> 18:11.786
I tell you, you know,
when it comes to the game,

18:11.786 --> 18:14.005
mind over matter.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.573
It is the mind--
well, mainly my mind.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.767
Where are the real cops,
Mouch, huh?

18:36.767 --> 18:39.118
Trudy says they come by
on a regular basis,

18:39.118 --> 18:40.902
but they don't
have the manpower

18:40.902 --> 18:43.122
to park a unit here full time

18:43.122 --> 18:44.949
based on one person's
complaint.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.778
- But--two people!
- Whoa.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.171
This is not my crusade.

18:49.171 --> 18:52.392
This--you gotta talk
to her, Mouch, okay?

18:52.392 --> 18:55.264
If you don't care about
wanton lawlessness,

18:55.264 --> 18:56.700
then do it for me.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.354
Do it for my sanity.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.455
Kylie said
you were looking for me?

19:12.455 --> 19:14.283
Yeah. Come on in.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.335
What's the beef
between you and Gallo?

19:23.553 --> 19:24.946
Beef?

19:24.946 --> 19:26.339
You two were barely
able to move a ladder

19:26.339 --> 19:28.036
together the other day.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.124
I mean, I've seen
better teamwork

19:29.124 --> 19:30.256
from the Three Stooges.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.822
That was just
a miscommunication.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.738
It was zero communication.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.741
What is going on?

19:39.003 --> 19:40.135
There's no beef.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.658
We had a conversation
last shift,

19:41.658 --> 19:44.922
at the end of which we came
to a mutual understanding.

19:44.922 --> 19:46.097
Which is?

19:48.274 --> 19:50.232
Look, Lieutenant,
Gallo and I don't need

19:50.232 --> 19:52.060
to be best friends
to work together.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.757
We're professionals.

19:53.757 --> 19:56.064
But we'll step up
the communication.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.718
You won't see
any more hiccups there.

19:59.459 --> 20:02.636
<i>Truck 81, person trapped,
3445 Rush.</i>

20:02.636 --> 20:05.552
Thanks.
We'll pick this up later.

20:25.180 --> 20:27.356
Tenant told me there's
someone trapped on the roof.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.272
The access door's jammed,
and I can't get out there.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.839
Lieutenant.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.884
Carver, go ahead and grab
the rabbit tool off the rig.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.146
Got it.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.800
You got a service
elevator up there?

20:36.800 --> 20:37.975
Yeah, I'll take you guys up.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.938
Access to the roof
is on this floor?

20:43.938 --> 20:46.419
Staircase is just
around the corner.

20:46.419 --> 20:47.898
Lady lieutenant, huh?

20:47.898 --> 20:49.596
Good for you.

20:49.596 --> 20:50.814
Thank you.

20:50.814 --> 20:53.208
All right, Carver,
you lead the way.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.731
Yep.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.392
Going in
with the rabbit tool.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.264
- All right.
- There a rooftop deck up here?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.048
No, but people still
like to go up there

21:07.048 --> 21:08.702
and just take in the view.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.443
I mean, I don't know how this
guy could have gotten trapped.

21:10.443 --> 21:11.966
Latch is popped,
but the door's

21:11.966 --> 21:12.967
still not going anywhere.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.973
Solid core--
we'd have to mangle this thing

21:18.973 --> 21:21.323
with the Halligan pretty good
to get out there.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.064
Any of those penthouse
apartments have balconies?

21:23.064 --> 21:24.761
Yeah, Mrs. Katz does.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.502
A nice one.

21:29.157 --> 21:31.594
Watch out
for the clay planters.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.991
I don't see any fire escape
ladders up to the roof,

21:36.991 --> 21:39.167
even though it's code.
- Lieutenant.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.777
I can climb the trellis,
get a foothold,

21:40.777 --> 21:42.039
and pull myself onto the roof.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.004
What the hell?

21:50.004 --> 21:52.354
Let's give it a shot.

21:57.403 --> 21:58.882
All right.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.323
Hey.
- Yep.

22:22.689 --> 22:24.081
All right.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.387
We'll meet you
at the roof door.

22:25.387 --> 22:26.997
Copy that.

22:33.874 --> 22:34.875
Hello?

22:55.461 --> 22:59.073
Lieutenant,
our victim isn't trapped.

22:59.073 --> 23:01.205
What are you doing here?

23:01.205 --> 23:02.424
Get away from me!

23:02.424 --> 23:04.644
Gallo, we didn't
catch the end of that.

23:04.644 --> 23:05.993
Hey, it's okay.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.690
<i>We just got a report
that there was</i>

23:07.690 --> 23:09.126
someone trapped on the roof.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.171
I'm here to help.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.955
I'm not trapped.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.609
<i>Get the hell out of here!</i>

23:15.785 --> 23:19.093
81 to Main,
we need a crisis negotiator

23:19.093 --> 23:22.444
to 3445 Rush right away.

23:22.444 --> 23:25.708
We have a potential suicide
in progress.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.493
What's your name?

23:27.493 --> 23:29.059
None of your business.

23:31.105 --> 23:32.541
Mine's Blake.

23:32.541 --> 23:35.979
And if there's anything
you want to talk out,

23:35.979 --> 23:38.678
I'm here,
and I want to help, okay?

23:38.678 --> 23:41.289
There's nothing to talk out.

23:41.289 --> 23:44.466
Well, something
got you up here.

23:49.384 --> 23:52.648
Made mistakes
that are gonna hurt people.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.653
A lot of us did,
but the buck stops with me.

24:00.526 --> 24:01.962
It sounds like you're being
pretty rough on yourself.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.659
You don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

24:03.659 --> 24:05.052
Okay.

24:05.052 --> 24:08.011
So... tell me?

24:10.536 --> 24:12.712
<i>Tomorrow, my company's
going to announce</i>

24:12.712 --> 24:16.367
we're closing more than
half our stores.

24:16.367 --> 24:20.415
Hundreds of people
will lose their jobs.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.286
That's rough. I'm sorry.

24:26.377 --> 24:29.032
I've been hearing that
a lot these days.

24:29.032 --> 24:33.167
Economy shifting, inflation.

24:33.167 --> 24:35.386
There's a lot out there
you can't control.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.042
Can I sit down?

24:39.042 --> 24:40.696
Promise, I'm not
gonna touch you.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.534
People can handle
losing their jobs.

24:52.534 --> 24:56.886
What's a lot harder
is losing the ones you love.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.714
I bet you have
a bunch of those.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.457
I got a few, yeah.

25:05.416 --> 25:08.071
I'm gonna be
an embarrassment to them.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.990
After this news comes out.

25:15.557 --> 25:18.821
Say that's true,
worst case scenario.

25:18.821 --> 25:22.216
Even so, time passes.

25:22.216 --> 25:23.391
Sooner than you think,

25:23.391 --> 25:26.394
it'll be
in the rear view mirror.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.701
You'll still be here.

25:28.701 --> 25:31.007
That's all they want.

25:31.007 --> 25:37.579
Every day, that's all I wish,
that my family was still here.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.712
<i>Crisis team
is two blocks away.</i>

25:39.712 --> 25:41.670
Copy that.

25:44.368 --> 25:45.892
<i>I appreciate you
saying that.</i>

25:45.892 --> 25:47.197
It's the truth.

25:47.197 --> 25:48.503
That's all.

25:50.723 --> 25:53.595
People can make it
through really hard times

25:53.595 --> 25:55.510
and still live
a beautiful life.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.170
I'm sorry about all this.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.432
It happens.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.521
All that matters is that the--

26:47.214 --> 26:48.694
<i>You didn't lie to him,
right?</i>

26:48.694 --> 26:50.434
Didn't make any promises
you couldn't keep?

26:50.434 --> 26:51.392
Anything like that?

26:54.917 --> 26:57.006
That's important.
Something I teach our guys.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.965
We don't lie
to a person in distress.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.752
You did a great job
keeping him talking.

27:03.752 --> 27:06.712
That's huge.
That's the main thing.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.844
I mean, you followed
the protocol

27:08.844 --> 27:12.500
without it even
being drilled into you.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.068
You should be proud.

27:15.068 --> 27:18.941
Look, sometimes a person steps
on a ledge and their mind

27:18.941 --> 27:20.856
is already made up
by the time you get there.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.379
You can do and say
all the right things

27:22.379 --> 27:25.165
and still not be able
to change them.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.776
The important thing is,
you didn't give up.

27:27.776 --> 27:31.911
I tell all my guys,
we do not give up, ever.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.046
For all of Gallo's bravado,

27:37.046 --> 27:40.006
he's one of the most
empathetic people I know.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.964
He's gonna have
a hard time shaking it off.

27:41.964 --> 27:44.837
I hope he doesn't
blame himself.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.447
We just got to keep
a close eye on him.

27:46.447 --> 27:47.709
That's all.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.671
He's a good friend.

27:52.671 --> 27:55.021
Yeah.

27:55.021 --> 27:59.460
Speaking of good friends,
um, I messed up.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.244
Messed up how?

28:01.244 --> 28:04.030
I have been pushy about Dylan

28:04.030 --> 28:06.032
without being sensitive
to the fact that you

28:06.032 --> 28:09.122
might not be ready to date yet.

28:09.122 --> 28:12.255
Well, I don't think
I'll ever be ready,

28:12.255 --> 28:15.258
but it doesn't mean
I shouldn't try.

28:17.130 --> 28:21.961
To be honest, that's not the
reason I haven't called Dylan.

28:21.961 --> 28:23.702
What do you mean?

28:23.702 --> 28:27.357
It's--it's the connection
between Dylan and Evan

28:27.357 --> 28:29.490
and the way he gets
so happy talking about him.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.840
What if things go badly,
and it would be like

28:31.840 --> 28:33.973
I'm taking that away?
- No, no, Sylvie.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.149
Forget all of that.

28:36.149 --> 28:40.544
Yes, it--it brought me
a wave of Evan to meet Dylan,

28:40.544 --> 28:43.069
but so does pretty much
everything that Evan has

28:43.069 --> 28:47.551
ever touched or been around.

28:47.551 --> 28:49.336
Sometimes it makes me happy.

28:49.336 --> 28:53.209
Sometimes it just hurts,

28:53.209 --> 28:58.127
and there's nothing that you or
anyone else can do to fix that.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.959
Do you get a good vibe
off Dylan or not?

29:05.482 --> 29:06.483
He's adorable.

29:06.483 --> 29:08.485
Well, then you
have to go for it.

29:12.576 --> 29:13.795
I've talked to Trudy.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.797
She said,
"I'll see what I can do."

29:17.843 --> 29:20.497
Well, it's better
than nothing.

29:25.285 --> 29:29.289
Told her how important
this was to you.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.421
Not to me.

29:31.421 --> 29:33.293
To society, Mouch!

29:35.034 --> 29:37.210
To society.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.428
<i>What are we looking at?</i>

29:38.428 --> 29:40.082
All right,
this blast pattern

29:40.082 --> 29:42.128
and the hole that was torn
through the plywood

29:42.128 --> 29:45.131
is indicative of a
high order explosion.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.307
- Caused by?
- Well, that's the question.

29:47.307 --> 29:51.006
Whatever caused this was
due to a commercial grade

29:51.006 --> 29:55.402
or most likely
a military grade explosive.

29:55.402 --> 29:56.664
Military?

29:56.664 --> 29:59.841
Military munitions
convert as much material

29:59.841 --> 30:01.974
as possible to kinetic energy.

30:01.974 --> 30:04.498
That's what makes them
predictable, efficient.

30:04.498 --> 30:07.675
So I started looking
for military devices

30:07.675 --> 30:10.112
that cause this pattern.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.985
I think it was a 40-millimeter
door breaching round

30:12.985 --> 30:14.029
from a grenade launcher.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.509
Door-breaching?

30:15.509 --> 30:17.511
It's a low velocity grenade
that uses blast pressure

30:17.511 --> 30:19.643
to bust a door down
from a distance

30:19.643 --> 30:21.863
and kill whoever is
on the other side.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.865
It's highly specialized stuff.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.301
So why is someone
running around

30:25.301 --> 30:26.520
shooting this thing for fun

30:26.520 --> 30:28.739
in an abandoned warehouse
on Pulaski?

30:28.739 --> 30:30.176
I don't think it was for fun.

30:30.176 --> 30:33.527
I think it was a demonstration.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.094
By who?

30:35.094 --> 30:38.532
By a seller showing a buyer
what his goods can do.

30:38.532 --> 30:41.796
So this individual that
you mentioned the other day,

30:41.796 --> 30:43.319
the guy you had your eye on,

30:43.319 --> 30:45.713
you're telling me that
he's selling military weapons

30:45.713 --> 30:47.062
inside Chicago?

30:47.062 --> 30:49.195
No, that's what
you're telling me.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.546
Can you stop him?

30:52.546 --> 30:55.592
I'm gonna try, but I'm gonna
need more help from you.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.072
What kind of help?

30:57.072 --> 30:59.770
I got to talk
to some people first.

30:59.770 --> 31:02.338
I'll keep you posted.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.905
Thanks, Kelly.
- Yeah.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.733
- Can I keep this?
- Yes.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.874
Hey.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.614
The boy's gonna hurt himself.

31:17.614 --> 31:18.789
What's that?

31:37.939 --> 31:40.594
So, Molly's later?

31:40.594 --> 31:42.117
Yeah, sure.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.862
Or I come over
with some beer, some pizza,

31:47.862 --> 31:49.733
my controller,
and we kill zombies

31:49.733 --> 31:51.910
in co-op mode until dawn.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.085
Sounds good.

31:53.085 --> 31:56.349
Or just, you know,
maybe just Molly's.

31:56.349 --> 31:58.003
Either way.

32:01.136 --> 32:03.095
Look, no pressure.

32:03.095 --> 32:05.924
You decide you want
to do anything, I'm there.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.926
Cool.

32:21.504 --> 32:24.725
Killing zombies
isn't gonna cut it.

32:24.725 --> 32:28.685
What you need is
to get comfortably numb.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.383
Let me buy you a beer or ten.

32:30.383 --> 32:34.430
With all due respect, Carver,
you have no idea what I need.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.432
- Sure, I do.
- No, you don't.

32:36.432 --> 32:38.217
You don't know
the first thing about me.

32:38.217 --> 32:41.785
I'm just an excitable kid
who just did it for kicks.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.483
I'm playing superhero.

32:43.483 --> 32:45.354
And you, you've--

32:45.354 --> 32:48.009
you've seen so much worse
than me.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.055
I didn't mean--
I shouldn't have said all that.

32:52.448 --> 32:53.667
I'm sorry.

32:55.886 --> 32:56.975
Look, I--

32:58.846 --> 33:00.804
I heard you over the radio.

33:00.804 --> 33:02.893
And family stuff,
that's tricky.

33:02.893 --> 33:05.461
I know how hard it can be.

33:09.161 --> 33:12.642
Let's hit up Carol's Pub
and close the place down.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.079
No offense,
but I've seen what happens

33:14.079 --> 33:14.993
when you hit a dive bar.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.996
A good time is what happens.

33:20.824 --> 33:22.913
You're coming out with me.

33:22.913 --> 33:24.480
That's that.

33:29.442 --> 33:31.226
All right.

33:34.360 --> 33:37.145
Hey, Mouch.

33:37.145 --> 33:39.104
<i>You left your duffel sitting
on the locker room bench.</i>

33:39.104 --> 33:40.322
I did?

33:40.322 --> 33:41.758
<i>You want me
to bring it to Molly's?</i>

33:41.758 --> 33:43.543
No, I'll circle back
and get it.

33:43.543 --> 33:45.153
Thanks, buddy.

33:48.591 --> 33:50.158
Are you kidding me?

34:01.909 --> 34:04.346
I understand there's been
a lot of infractions

34:04.346 --> 34:06.348
at this intersection.

34:06.348 --> 34:09.656
No, it--yeah.

34:09.656 --> 34:13.964
There are actual hoodlums,
you know,

34:13.964 --> 34:17.098
driving right through
the stop sign.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.100
Like you just did.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.449
No.

34:20.449 --> 34:23.931
I left my bag in the firehouse,
and I--really?

34:23.931 --> 34:25.628
Really?

34:25.628 --> 34:27.065
Come on, Trudy.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.545
You drag me out here
to write citations,

34:29.545 --> 34:32.244
then I'm writing citations.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.549
You can pay this online.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.725
Hey, oh, look at me.

34:37.292 --> 34:38.815
Tell Cindy I'll see her
at book club.

34:38.815 --> 34:41.122
I have got a recipe for her.

34:43.907 --> 34:47.911
It's kind of
an overpowering nausea.

34:47.911 --> 34:49.652
Like, maybe I should
turn around and go home.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.263
<i>No. Do not do that.</i>

34:51.263 --> 34:52.351
<i>This is gonna be fun.</i>

34:52.351 --> 34:53.482
Oh, I hope so.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.049
<i>And you look beautiful.</i>

34:55.049 --> 34:56.442
Oh, do I?

34:56.442 --> 34:59.009
Or is this outfit way too much
for a coffee date?

34:59.009 --> 35:00.794
<i>No, no, it's perfect. Seriously.</i>

35:00.794 --> 35:02.187
<i>I just fell in love with you.</i>

35:11.674 --> 35:12.936
<i>What's happening?</i>

35:12.936 --> 35:14.764
<i>What's that smile
on your face?</i>

35:14.764 --> 35:16.897
Um, I just saw him.
I'm here.

35:16.897 --> 35:19.247
<i>Okay, I'm hanging up.
Have fun. Bye.</i>

35:19.247 --> 35:20.248
Okay.

35:24.513 --> 35:26.254
Gallo's resilient.

35:26.254 --> 35:27.821
Nothing keeps him down.

35:27.821 --> 35:31.520
I know that it seems
that way, you know,

35:31.520 --> 35:35.263
his peppy disposition,
but he really feels things.

35:35.263 --> 35:36.873
And I just--

35:36.873 --> 35:41.095
I wish that I knew how
to help him through this.

35:41.095 --> 35:44.359
He'll--he'll figure it
out in his own timeline.

35:44.359 --> 35:45.578
That's all.

35:52.237 --> 35:53.151
Hey.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.198
This a bad time?

35:57.198 --> 35:58.330
Yeah, it is.

35:58.330 --> 35:59.679
Nah. Come in.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.376
You eat yet?

36:01.376 --> 36:03.596
No, I'm good. Thanks.

36:03.596 --> 36:04.727
I'll get out of here
in a minute.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.686
All right. What's up?

36:06.686 --> 36:08.862
Well.

36:08.862 --> 36:11.517
This is our friend
who's hawking military weapons

36:11.517 --> 36:13.693
on the streets of Chicago.

36:13.693 --> 36:15.477
His name is Vin Martucci.

36:15.477 --> 36:17.000
- You pick him up?
- Not yet.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.567
I don't have the goods on him.

36:18.567 --> 36:21.875
But he does have a relationship
with Danny Kavanagh.

36:21.875 --> 36:24.791
You remember that name?

36:24.791 --> 36:26.401
You mean the dirty cop
who almost

36:26.401 --> 36:28.142
got me and Stella killed?

36:28.142 --> 36:29.752
Yeah, kind of hard to forget.

36:29.752 --> 36:32.190
Well, when you went over
my head and got Danny arrested,

36:32.190 --> 36:35.280
this is one of several ongoing
cases that you compromised.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.805
Fortunately for us, Kavanagh's
still willing to negotiate.

36:38.805 --> 36:41.329
Tell us what he knows, help get
those weapons off the street.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.636
Such a good guy.

36:43.636 --> 36:44.941
What does that
have to do with me?

36:44.941 --> 36:46.508
State's attorney's not
willing to strike a deal

36:46.508 --> 36:49.598
with Kavanagh unless
his victims sign off on it.

36:49.598 --> 36:50.643
His victims?

36:52.514 --> 36:54.124
You and Stella.

36:57.519 --> 37:00.218
What kind of a deal
are we talking about?

37:00.218 --> 37:04.874
Kavanagh helps us
take down Martucci,

37:04.874 --> 37:06.833
he gets time served.
- He walks?

37:06.833 --> 37:08.008
Martucci's a bad dude, Kelly.

37:08.008 --> 37:09.836
So is Kavanagh. No deal.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.185
I need Kavanagh's
cooperation.

37:11.185 --> 37:14.014
- Find another way.
- Look, be reasonable.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.972
Dragging me out
to that warehouse, tapping me

37:15.972 --> 37:17.322
for my expertise,
you were just trying

37:17.322 --> 37:19.149
to get me invested
in this thing

37:19.149 --> 37:21.543
because you knew
you'd end up having

37:21.543 --> 37:22.936
to ask me the unthinkable.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.894
- It wasn't like that.
- Get out.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.809
- Come on, Kelly.
- Get out!

37:37.080 --> 37:39.387
We don't do this deal,
a lot of people

37:39.387 --> 37:40.432
are gonna get hurt.

37:43.348 --> 37:44.914
And that's on you too.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.891
He didn't mean
to break it, sir.

38:04.891 --> 38:06.762
It was an accident.

38:06.762 --> 38:07.807
I'm sorry.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.811
He was mad.

38:11.811 --> 38:14.553
Whoa!

38:14.553 --> 38:16.076
Okay, all right.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.948
All right, next stop.
What's the next stop?

38:18.948 --> 38:21.864
I'm sorry to say,
but I think it's--

38:21.864 --> 38:23.039
I think that's
the end of the line.

38:23.039 --> 38:24.954
It's almost 4:00.
- What? Come on!

38:24.954 --> 38:26.478
You know the phrase,
you can't go home,

38:26.478 --> 38:27.957
but you can't stay here.

38:27.957 --> 38:30.220
- Eh...
- Yeah, I know. I know.

38:30.220 --> 38:33.267
Um, Old Town Ale House
is open late.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.182
Oh, man.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.488
Aw.

38:36.488 --> 38:38.751
It closes at 4:00.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.100
Bummer.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.493
I'll get us an Uber.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.691
I thought I had him.

39:05.691 --> 39:06.779
I know.

39:06.779 --> 39:08.563
I was absolutely sure.

39:08.563 --> 39:10.478
There was nothing more
you could have done.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.964
Maybe if someone else
got there first.

39:17.964 --> 39:20.532
But you got there, Gallo.

39:20.532 --> 39:23.317
And you gave him the best
chance he could have had.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.627
You don't know that.

39:28.627 --> 39:30.063
Yeah, I do.

39:32.674 --> 39:36.156
You got about the coolest head
in a crisis I have ever seen.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.332
Keeping your wits when there's
20,000 cubic feet of fuel

39:38.332 --> 39:41.422
overhead ready to blow us all
to hell?

39:41.422 --> 39:43.859
You'll do whatever
it takes to save a life.

39:45.861 --> 39:49.474
Sometimes even that
isn't enough.

39:49.474 --> 39:51.127
That's the job.

39:51.127 --> 39:52.781
Sometimes people just...

39:59.614 --> 40:01.399
Look, I know it hurts.

40:03.096 --> 40:04.532
Believe me, I do.

40:06.099 --> 40:07.274
So let it hurt.

40:09.276 --> 40:11.670
You feel like you need
to cry about it, do it.

40:11.670 --> 40:14.107
You feel like you want
to scream or punch someone,

40:14.107 --> 40:16.979
scream at me, punch me.

40:16.979 --> 40:20.374
Do whatever you need to do.

40:20.374 --> 40:22.115
But do not let that change
the kind of firefighter

40:22.115 --> 40:23.725
you are, Gallo.

40:23.725 --> 40:25.335
'Cause I'll tell you something.

40:25.335 --> 40:29.339
If I'm ever in a tight spot,

40:29.339 --> 40:31.037
there's no other kind
of smoke eater

40:31.037 --> 40:33.692
I'd rather have on my side.

40:33.692 --> 40:36.259
Yeah.

40:44.354 --> 40:46.966
Come on.

40:46.966 --> 40:48.533
Mike's Cop Bar
is open till 5:00.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.230
Ah.

40:54.756 --> 40:56.628
I broke that--

40:56.628 --> 40:58.020
I know you broke that, man!

40:58.020 --> 41:00.327
Well, when the guy
got so mad, I...
