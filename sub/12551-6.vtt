there is such
a thing as destiny?

00:15.849 --> 00:17.384
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>There might be a story in it.</i>

00:17.450 --> 00:19.919
-He could be an alien.
-No. Trueman is human.

00:19.986 --> 00:23.390
Everyone was talking about
their star signs.
And I don't have one.

00:23.456 --> 00:26.659
I've got things to do.
Such amazing things.

00:28.328 --> 00:31.398
The Ancient Lights
will destroy you!

00:34.534 --> 00:36.102
What if there was
another universe?

00:36.169 --> 00:40.473
Where the laws of physics
were different
and astrology worked.

00:42.075 --> 00:44.277

MR SMITH:

00:48.548 --> 00:52.385
-How will we stop Trueman?
-You can't stop him.

00:52.452 --> 00:54.187
<i>Welcome to the future.</i>

00:54.254 --> 00:58.758
Sarah Jane,
you must be destroyed.

That's it.
You don't want to hurt us.

01:39.833 --> 01:44.270
-Clyde.
-Stay still. All of you.

01:44.337 --> 01:47.340
-Clyde,
come on, what are you doing?
-Quiet.

01:47.407 --> 01:50.543
I have
a message for the world.
Don't be afraid.

If ever he had it.

02:14.133 --> 02:17.637
I'll phone the cable company.
We're not paying to watch
any more of this.

02:17.704 --> 02:21.341
<i>-This is your destiny.</i>
-No. No, no.

<i>-Life will be so much</i>

02:38.858 --> 02:41.261
<i>-so much easier for everyone.</i>
-Gita?

02:41.327 --> 02:43.429
<i>-You don't have</i>

-Gita?

<i>As you listen to</i>

-Gita.
-Of course. I understand.

-Understand what?
-I'm one of
the first to be chosen.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.013

Walk out, my children.
Leave your homes.

03:03.349 --> 03:06.786
Gather together.
Find your
brothers and sisters.

03:06.853 --> 03:10.990
Take their hands.
Join the circle.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.560
Go, now.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.528
I've got to go.

03:15.595 --> 03:18.264
I know what you're up to.
I'm not falling for it.

03:18.331 --> 03:20.433
Stop this now.
The wind-up is over.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.002
I mustn't stop.
I've got to go.

03:23.069 --> 03:26.306
Okay. And now you're
scaring me.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.541
Please tell me
you're having a laugh.
I won't mind.

03:28.608 --> 03:32.745
You can tell everyone I
believed you, just say this is
you pulling my leg.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.847
-Gita?
-I've got to go.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.485
Clyde, you can reject it,
I know you.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.354
You say you're
a part of my gang.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.323
I never saw it quite
like that, but you're right.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.925
We are a gang, a team,
we rely on each other.

-You've been warned,
Sarah Jane.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.969
I will destroy you.

03:56.035 --> 03:58.304
You've got orders from Trueman
to deal with me? Yes?

03:58.371 --> 04:00.273
You understand that at last.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.008
Then you can
let Rani and Luke go.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.712
-What, Sarah Jane?
I'm not going.
-Oh, yes, you are. Now.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.948
-She may pass.
-I'll get help.

04:12.118 --> 04:14.187
-Now you, Luke.
-Mum, I'm not leaving you.

04:14.253 --> 04:16.822
It's an order.

04:16.889 --> 04:18.625
Clyde, remember what
you said last night?

04:18.690 --> 04:20.793
-Astrology is rubbish.
-I was wrong.

04:20.860 --> 04:23.796
-I didn't understand then.
-What did Trueman do to you?

04:23.863 --> 04:28.267
I'm sorry you can't feel
the way I do. Yet.

04:28.334 --> 04:31.371

Not you, too!

Rani, don't be afraid.
This is the best thing that
ever happened to me.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.229
Gita, stop this now.
Gita! Stay here.

you are only the first
to join the Ancient Lights.

<i>Already it is time</i>
<i>for Cancer to join the circle.</i>

-What's he talking about?
-Gemini, then Cancer.

05:28.294 --> 05:30.730
He's taking over
all the star signs,
one by one.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.438
-Come on, let's find a circle.
-Yes, all together.

05:40.473 --> 05:43.009
-GEORGE: What are they doing?
-Go back, Rani.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.812
Stay inside and don't let
anybody in the house.

05:45.878 --> 05:47.847
-Promise me.
-I promise.

05:47.914 --> 05:51.084
<i>Soon all the signs</i>
<i>will come under my power.</i>

05:51.150 --> 05:55.455
<i>At the becoming of</i>

<i>I will be king of the world!</i>

05:58.291 --> 06:00.293
Clyde, this thing
that's possessed you,
it's alien.

06:00.359 --> 06:02.462
More alien than anything
we've met before.

06:02.528 --> 06:05.598
It comes from
before the Big Bang.
From another universe.

06:05.665 --> 06:09.168
You don't
understand something,
so you call it alien.

06:09.235 --> 06:12.638
Sarah Jane, you always
say there's so much more
to the world

06:12.705 --> 06:15.708
than most people
will ever know.
Why not this?

06:15.775 --> 06:17.944
It's made you Trueman's slave.
You want that?

06:18.010 --> 06:21.347
Trueman is the Chosen One
and I will follow him forever.

06:21.414 --> 06:23.382
And he ordered
me to destroy you.

06:23.449 --> 06:26.586
Clyde, you know me.
I am never going to submit.

06:26.652 --> 06:29.489
I am going to fight this thing
and send it back.

I'll destroy it.
-Mum, be careful.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.060
I know what I'm doing, Luke,
so get out of my way.

Can you do it?
You've got
orders from Trueman.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.199
You want to stop me
walking out of here?

06:40.266 --> 06:42.101
Go ahead. Stop me!

06:42.168 --> 06:46.706
Sarah Jane, it's got my mum.
Loads of people
are just walking off.

06:46.773 --> 06:50.810
-I know you can't do it.
-I must stop you.

06:50.877 --> 06:53.246
Clyde, no.

-You shouldn't have done this.

<i>Since the broadcast,</i>
<i>some people seem</i>

He started with Gemini.
Now it's spreading,
taking over everybody.

08:15.394 --> 08:18.564
That's what he wants.
A world of slaves.

08:18.631 --> 08:22.101
Perhaps the Ancient Lights
controlled people
in the old universe.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.438
Now they want to control us,
through Trueman.

08:25.504 --> 08:28.741
My mum's there, one of them.
What are we gonna do?

08:28.808 --> 08:32.211
I mean, the government
can't do anything
and the world's going under,

08:32.278 --> 08:34.480
so what on Earth
can the four of us do?

08:34.547 --> 08:36.948
We saved Clyde,
we can save Gita.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.652
-We can save them all.
-But how did we save Clyde?

08:39.719 --> 08:42.488
The Ancient Lights
survived the Big Bang.

08:42.554 --> 08:45.791
-How could Clyde stop them?
-Don't look at me.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.629
-You must know something.
-It's like a dream.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.764
I can't believe
I was saying all that stuff.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.833
How did you feel
when the power left you?

08:53.900 --> 08:56.869
Like I was hypnotised,
I suppose.

08:56.936 --> 09:01.107
And then, suddenly,
the real me was back.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.943
It was like the hypnotised me
got switched off.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.511
I'm sorry, Sarah Jane.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.480
No, you couldn't
help yourself.

09:07.546 --> 09:10.850
Believe me,
I know what it's like
to be taken over.

09:10.917 --> 09:14.687
We don't know how we
saved you. How can we do it
again? It's hopeless.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.389
There's always hope, Rani.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.357
Wait.

09:18.424 --> 09:22.395
Now, I pushed you.
I knew you couldn't harm me.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.864
-That must be it.
-Lost again. What do you mean?

09:24.931 --> 09:27.199
I forced you to do something
you could never normally do.

09:27.266 --> 09:31.203
Your real self fought against
the Ancient Lights and
broke free of that influence.

09:31.270 --> 09:33.572
I need to try the same thing
with Trueman.

09:33.639 --> 09:34.941
Force him into a corner,

09:35.007 --> 09:37.310
make him confront
what this is making him do.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.612
Well, that's it! Come on.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.985
But Clyde's your friend,
Trueman isn't. How can you
get through to him?

09:46.052 --> 09:48.421
-I can try.
-But he's taking
over all the signs.

09:48.621 --> 09:51.324
-He'll take all of us over.
-Wait.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.159
Trueman's broadcast.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.927
He must be using it to
transmit his energy
around the world.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.430
How? He's got
control of the world's TV.

09:57.496 --> 09:59.198
Yes.
Controlled from the theatre.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.600
So we cut off the electricity
in the theatre?

10:01.667 --> 10:04.670
If he hasn't got a camera,
he can't transmit anything.

10:04.737 --> 10:09.141
-Is that a stupid idea?
-That is a brilliant idea.
Come on!

10:13.412 --> 10:15.581
-Any joy?
-Still no signal.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.220
The Children of Gemini
must join the Chosen One.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.857
-We are the Inner Circle.
-I don't believe this.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.932
This is insane.
I'm going to get help.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.637
Children of Scorpio, join me.

11:13.639 --> 11:19.011
The Inner Circle.
My first subjects,
children of Gemini.

11:19.078 --> 11:23.449
Don't be afraid.
Our lives have been
leading to this moment.

11:23.516 --> 11:27.920
We never had any choice.
My life brought me here.

11:27.987 --> 11:31.757
All the wasted years
leading to this moment.

11:31.824 --> 11:34.527
But somehow I always knew
I was different.

11:34.593 --> 11:38.531
Special. Chosen.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.044
SARAH JANE:
How do we get past them?

11:52.111 --> 11:53.345
RANI:
We've got to do something.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.181
-I can get us in.
-No, Clyde.

11:55.247 --> 11:57.850
I'm a Gemini.
One of Trueman's Inner Circle.
It's gotta be me.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.986
-I can't ask you
to take that risk.
-You didn't ask. I offered.

12:01.053 --> 12:02.221
Let's go!

12:02.288 --> 12:06.625
Children of Sagittarius,
join the circle.

12:06.692 --> 12:08.360
There are so many now.
We haven't got long.

12:08.427 --> 12:09.862
Right. I can do this.

12:09.929 --> 12:13.999
You've got to
look sort of dopey.
Blissed out.

12:14.066 --> 12:17.570
-Mmm. Make it creepy.
-All right. Let's roll.

12:17.636 --> 12:20.039
Clyde, you don't
have to do this. I can
find another way in.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.308
-There's no other way.
-SARAH JANE: It's too
dangerous.

12:22.374 --> 12:24.276
One slip, they could blast
you down.

12:24.343 --> 12:26.946
If you were in my shoes,
you'd do it.

12:32.785 --> 12:37.156
-Your face is wrong.
Copy them.
-Be quiet, boy.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.625
Have you come to
join the circle?

12:39.692 --> 12:43.629
Why have you
brought these people?
They're not among the chosen.

12:43.696 --> 12:48.601
I'm one of Mr Trueman's
Inner Circle. He sent me
to bring these people to him.

12:48.667 --> 12:51.770
-They are my prisoners.
-But nobody can go in.

12:51.837 --> 12:55.241
We have orders to stop
anybody that tries.

12:55.307 --> 12:59.111
But you can't harm me.
I am one of
the children of Gemini.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.180
But they aren't.

13:01.247 --> 13:06.585
They're not chosen.
I think you are lying.

13:06.652 --> 13:10.956
And I'm one of the Inner
Circle. I know all
the mysteries of the stars.

13:11.023 --> 13:17.963
Mars has entered the Milky
Way and Aero is in
conjunction with the Galaxy.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.266
-Step aside.
-We did not know.

13:20.332 --> 13:24.637
-Pass through, quickly.
-May the Ancient
Lights shine upon you.

13:30.209 --> 13:32.978
Join me,
children of Capricorn.

13:35.247 --> 13:38.984
There's an intruder.
The boy Clyde.

13:39.051 --> 13:44.356
He's somewhere here.
I don't understand.
This was not destined.

13:44.423 --> 13:48.594
-He's one of us.
-No. There is something wrong.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.830
He's nearby,
but I can't reach his mind.

13:51.897 --> 13:54.700
Quickly.
Find him. Bring him to me.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.505
-Wasn't bad, was I?
-You were magnificent!

13:59.572 --> 14:02.107
-I'm expecting
a ripping of applause.
-Right.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.843
You three, get backstage.
Find the power supply.
Switch it off.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.512
RAVI: Right.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.314
And you're going
back to Trueman?

14:08.380 --> 14:10.749
To try to reach his true self,
like I did with you.

14:10.816 --> 14:13.786
On your own?
No way, Sarah Jane.

14:13.852 --> 14:16.288
Mr Trueman would
like to see you, Clyde.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.592
And I'm sure
he'll be delighted
to see you, Miss Smith.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.760
Come on! He's moving
through the zodiac.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.929
When he gets to Aries,
I'll be taken over.

14:24.129 --> 14:26.232
There must be
a switching room.
It's a public building.

14:26.298 --> 14:29.368
Health and Safety regulations
say there must be
an emergency cut-off switch

14:29.435 --> 14:32.271
-in case of a fire or flood.
-How do you know?

14:32.338 --> 14:35.874
It's on
the notice board at school.
I remember everything I read.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.319
-Rani's mum!
-There's nothing
we can do for her.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.623
What happened to you, Clyde?
My influence is gone.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.524
How could you
leave my Inner Circle?

14:52.591 --> 14:55.995
I was too strong.
I fought it and I got free.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.230
-That's not possible.
-I saw it happen.

14:58.297 --> 15:00.332
It doesn't matter.
Perhaps it was fate

15:00.399 --> 15:03.235
that you should be here
to witness my apotheosis.

15:03.302 --> 15:05.504
-Your what?
-One step further...

15:05.571 --> 15:09.675
You know what I can do.
Now, kneel before me.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.378
Do as he says.

15:15.381 --> 15:18.550
RANI: Oh, no,
he's got Sarah Jane and Clyde.

15:18.617 --> 15:21.954
-I don't even know what
we are looking for?
-The emergency main switch.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.956
-What does that look like?
-I'm not entirely sure.

15:24.023 --> 15:27.459
-Oh, great.
-I don't think it's in here.
Come on.

15:27.526 --> 15:31.130
Can I just ask,
what are you gonna do
when you rule the world?

15:31.196 --> 15:33.866
The Ancient
Lights will use Earth
as a starting point

15:33.932 --> 15:36.835
and I will teach my people
how to use their minds

15:36.902 --> 15:39.705
and the power of the stars
to go out into space,

15:39.772 --> 15:43.142
until every mind in creation
belongs to me.

15:43.208 --> 15:47.012
But why? What do
the Ancient Lights get
out of bossing people around?

15:47.079 --> 15:49.982
Control is the purpose
of the Ancient Lights.

15:50.049 --> 15:53.752
Trueman, listen to me.
There must still be
something human inside you.

15:53.819 --> 15:55.287
Think of your life
before this happened.

15:55.354 --> 15:58.924
(CHUCKLING) My life before?
Which part of my life?

15:58.991 --> 16:01.527
The part when I was selling
vacuum cleaners?

16:01.593 --> 16:03.829
When I was rounding up
shopping trolleys?

16:03.896 --> 16:06.999
When I was cleaning toilets?
I was a nobody.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.468
And this is your way
of becoming a somebody?

16:09.535 --> 16:12.371
Yesterday, nobody cared.
Today,
everybody knows your name.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.307
What do you want
to be known for?
Enslaving millions of people?

16:15.374 --> 16:18.077
(LAUGHING) Do you really
think that is going
to work?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.879
Making an appeal
to my better nature?

16:20.946 --> 16:24.983
Don't you see? The human
part of me is loving every
moment of this.

16:25.050 --> 16:28.087
It's cruel and senseless.
You're a puppet
of these Ancient Lights!

16:28.153 --> 16:30.322
No, Sarah Jane. I am unique.

16:30.389 --> 16:33.992
The Ancient Lights
have been waiting
13 billion years for me.

16:34.059 --> 16:38.030
I was born at
exactly the right moment,
at exactly the right time.

16:38.097 --> 16:41.467
I am the most important person
on the planet, on any planet.

16:41.533 --> 16:45.003
People used to say to me,
"Martin, you're not
the centre of the universe."

16:45.070 --> 16:47.039
It turns out, I am.

16:47.106 --> 16:49.541
-And I never even knew it.
-Listen to him!

16:49.608 --> 16:52.111
He's going to make
all of us his slaves.

16:52.177 --> 16:57.850
I want it to happen.
The Ancient
Lights are shining.

16:57.916 --> 17:02.087
-The conjunction.
It's starting.
-(RUMBLING)

17:02.154 --> 17:03.989
Form the Inner Circle!

17:07.226 --> 17:09.261
(RUMBLING CONTINUES)

17:09.328 --> 17:13.398
I must speak to the world.
My world.

17:13.464 --> 17:18.436
<i>The time has nearly come.</i>
<i>Children of Pisces,</i>
<i>prepare yourselves.</i>

17:29.548 --> 17:32.518
Our big plan,
"Talk him out of it."
It didn't work!

17:32.584 --> 17:35.788
So that can't be how you got
the Ancient Lights out of me.

17:35.854 --> 17:38.357
It must be something else.
Something we missed.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.526
(LOUD EXPLOSION)

17:40.592 --> 17:43.228
What was it?
What's so special about me?

17:43.295 --> 17:45.864
Oh, so many things.

17:51.570 --> 17:56.108
He said we were
gonna lose, didn't he?
But we can't lose, Sarah Jane.

17:56.175 --> 17:59.411
We always win.
We're the team,
we're the nuts.

17:59.478 --> 18:01.447
Hold on. The others
can still stop this.

18:01.513 --> 18:04.516
(RUMBLING)

18:14.993 --> 18:17.429
(PULSATING)

18:20.766 --> 18:22.868
-The Ancient Lights!
-The Ancient Lights!

18:24.503 --> 18:26.505
Yes!

18:26.572 --> 18:28.874
Luke! Down here!

18:31.343 --> 18:33.145
Come on! Now!

18:36.715 --> 18:41.019
My destiny is now.

18:41.086 --> 18:43.589
I'm not letting this happen.
Not to my mum.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.858
It's too late.

18:47.092 --> 18:49.928
The zodiac is nearly complete.

18:50.128 --> 18:52.331
The emergency main switch.

18:52.397 --> 18:53.832
(CRACKLING)

18:53.899 --> 18:55.501
RANI: Ow!

18:55.567 --> 18:59.171
-He's put a shield around it.
-No! Mum.

18:59.238 --> 19:01.573
Children of Aries, join me.

19:03.275 --> 19:05.744
I accept the Ancient Lights.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.582
No. Rani!

19:10.649 --> 19:13.986
Yes! The Ancient Lights!

19:17.055 --> 19:21.860
All around the world,
the Ancient Lights are reborn.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.397
Nothing there.

19:27.933 --> 19:31.036
-They did it!
-Yes! The team!

19:31.103 --> 19:34.907
You flicked a switch?
Flicked a switch?

19:34.973 --> 19:37.543
The Ancient Lights
survived the Big Bang,

19:37.609 --> 19:40.812
and you think
you can stop them
by flicking a switch?

19:43.181 --> 19:47.319
-I have been chosen.
-No. Rani!

19:47.386 --> 19:50.856
I only needed the signal
to broadcast my instructions.

19:50.923 --> 19:54.927
I can find another signal.
Right now, it doesn't matter.

19:55.127 --> 19:58.764
Don't you understand?
The Zodiac is almost complete.

19:58.830 --> 20:01.833
Only the children
of Taurus to claim.

20:01.900 --> 20:06.738
And then even you
will know my power,
Sarah Jane Smith.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.676
(PULSATING)

20:13.312 --> 20:16.014
-Mum, I did it.
-Nothing can stop it now.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.819
Luke!

20:20.886 --> 20:24.690
That's it! Of course.

20:24.756 --> 20:27.025
I must stop you.

20:27.092 --> 20:29.227
Clyde, no.
Think about what you're doing.

20:29.294 --> 20:32.531
You shouldn't have forced me.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.767
I know what happened.
I touched Clyde!

20:35.834 --> 20:37.869
-(GASPING)
-It's me.

20:40.372 --> 20:43.342
-Luke, what are you doing?
-Watch!

20:43.408 --> 20:44.943
(ELECTRIC BUZZING)

20:53.752 --> 20:55.087
-What...
-Yes!

20:55.153 --> 20:56.989
-No!
-What happened?

20:57.055 --> 20:59.391
(SCREAMING) No! No!

21:01.126 --> 21:02.861
-(ALL CHATTERING)
-ALL: What's going on?

21:02.928 --> 21:05.530
George, Jon, what's going on?

21:05.597 --> 21:07.866
How have you done this?

21:07.933 --> 21:12.704
-I wasn't born.
I have no birthday.
-No star sign.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.240
So astrology
doesn't work on me.

21:15.307 --> 21:18.677
The Circle was like
an electrical circuit.
I broke it.

21:18.744 --> 21:22.280
Like you did before.
You touched Clyde.
It shorted the power.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.950
-What are you?
-He's my son.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.452
And he's
the centre of my universe.

21:28.854 --> 21:32.991
-Everything,
everybody is born.
-I wasn't.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.961
And I thought it
was a bad thing.
Until now.

21:36.028 --> 21:39.798
You had everything planned.
All mapped out in the stars.

21:39.865 --> 21:43.869
But Luke's got no stars.
No star sign. You didn't even
know he was there.

21:43.935 --> 21:47.472
It was the only chance.
The perfect conjunction.

21:47.539 --> 21:51.276
-(RUMBLING)
-They're already moving.

21:51.343 --> 21:57.783
The old knowledge
of the Ancient Lights
will be lost forever.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.851
(PULSATING)

22:02.087 --> 22:05.023
And I'll be lost without them.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.326
We've got to help him!

22:08.393 --> 22:12.564
-Let the power go, Trueman.
-No! It is foretold.

22:12.631 --> 22:16.968
Come on, Martin.
Step out of the light. Martin!

22:17.035 --> 22:19.871
I was born for this,
my destiny!

22:21.907 --> 22:25.510
There's nothing
left for me here.

22:25.577 --> 22:29.748
I can't go back
to being nobody.
Let me go.

22:31.383 --> 22:34.953
Let me go to the stars.

22:54.072 --> 22:59.444
Even at the end, he wouldn't
let it go. He must have
wanted it so much.

22:59.511 --> 23:02.881
-What happened to him?
-Perhaps it destroyed him.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.717
Or perhaps he went to join
the Ancient Lights.

23:05.784 --> 23:09.121
-(GASPING)
-Mum! She's waking up.

23:09.187 --> 23:13.225
-She'll be fine.
Won't remember a thing.
-We'd better get out of here.

23:13.291 --> 23:14.960
Unless you fancy
explaining it all to her.

23:15.026 --> 23:17.863
And explaining all about me
and aliens and everything.

23:19.297 --> 23:22.400
Come on. Quick!

23:22.467 --> 23:25.871
Best part of
being on this team,
running away afterwards.

23:25.937 --> 23:27.405

You will find love
in a launderette."

-Wrong.
Today, I saved the world.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.582
You did? Single-handed?

-Up. Down. Up.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.463

24:58.530 --> 25:01.032
I just wondered if you were
under my control now.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.168
Good idea. We could get him
to clean the car.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.804
(LAUGHING) Very funny.
I thought we agreed

25:05.871 --> 25:08.340
never to mention that
up-down thingy ever again.

-What is it?

I've got no mobile.

I'm nobody, I'm no one.
I don't exist!

hypnotised through the telly.

25:34.766 --> 25:36.201
It's been on the news.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.637
It was a publicity stunt
that went wrong.

25:38.703 --> 25:42.741
When they find this man,
Martin Trueman, I hope they
throw the book at him.

25:42.807 --> 25:46.444
I can't remember
a thing about it. What was
I doing at the theatre?

25:46.511 --> 25:49.347
Don't worry about it, Mum.
It's over. We can get
back to normal.

25:49.414 --> 25:52.884
I'm so sorry, love.
You must have
been worried sick.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.987
-Sat here all on your own.
-I was fine.

25:58.056 --> 26:01.326
Look at you, Rani.
Cool as a cucumber.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.930
Right.
If someone lays the table,
I'll get some tea together.

26:04.996 --> 26:08.700
Oh, okay. Just so long
as you don't make
macaroni cheese again.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.402
And what's wrong with
my macaroni cheese?

26:10.468 --> 26:12.637
(LAUGHING) Oh, what's right
with it?

26:12.704 --> 26:16.041
Well, it's sticky, it's heavy.
It should be light.

26:16.107 --> 26:17.943
-Rani?
-I think your
cooking's great, Dad.

26:18.009 --> 26:19.110
-(GASPING)
-Thank you.

26:19.177 --> 26:21.513
Right. Come on, I'll show you.

26:21.579 --> 26:22.948
You don't always have to go
mad, you know.

26:23.014 --> 26:24.849
Putting cornflour
into everything.

26:26.451 --> 26:28.553
Like nothing happened.

26:32.190 --> 26:36.628
He waited so long to achieve
something. And we just stopped
it from happening.

26:36.695 --> 26:40.165
Perhaps us
stopping it was destiny.

26:40.231 --> 26:42.300
I don't think
I believe in destiny.

26:42.367 --> 26:44.369
You still miss not
having a birthday?

26:44.436 --> 26:46.871
No, thanks.
Why should I want to be
like everyone else?

26:46.938 --> 26:50.308
Today, me being different
was a good thing.

26:50.375 --> 26:54.279
Today, you being different
saved the world.

26:54.346 --> 26:57.148
-Why don't we
celebrate this day, then?
-That's a great idea.

26:57.215 --> 26:59.384
Every year,
this could be my special day.

26:59.451 --> 27:00.986
-Deal!
-Can I have presents?

27:01.052 --> 27:03.288
Oh, whatever you want.

27:03.355 --> 27:06.624
Plus cards, cakes,
lots and lots of attention.

27:06.691 --> 27:09.527
And a party!
Oh, how about a party?

27:14.032 --> 27:16.501
I think it's evil.
Make it stop!

27:19.504 --> 27:20.905
What are you, then?

27:20.972 --> 27:23.742
The more you use it,
it talks to you.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.379
-Hello, Son.
-Dad?

27:27.445 --> 27:30.181
-What the hell
are you doing here?
-Come on!

27:30.248 --> 27:36.421
-We shouldn't have secrets.
-Dad, I save the world.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.557
Jacob West found
something here.
Something alien.

27:39.624 --> 27:41.459
Jacob? Jacob!

27:42.293 --> 27:43.094
No!
