00:56.424 --> 00:57.968
January, 1961.

00:58.635 --> 01:02.264
President Dwight D. Eisenhower's
Farewell Address to the Nation.

01:02.889 --> 01:07.727
This conjunction of an immense military
establishment and arms industry is new...

01:08.270 --> 01:10.272
...in the American experience.

01:10.355 --> 01:11.982
The total influence...

01:12.065 --> 01:14.734
...economic, political, even spiritual...

01:15.569 --> 01:19.906
...is felt in every city, every Statehouse,
every government office.

01:20.782 --> 01:23.201
We must guard against the acquisition...

01:23.285 --> 01:27.080
...of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought...

01:27.163 --> 01:29.916
...by the military-industrial complex.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.044
We must never let the weight
of this combination...

01:33.128 --> 01:36.006
...endanger our liberties
or democratic processes.

01:37.716 --> 01:39.009
November, 1960.

01:39.509 --> 01:42.345
Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy
of Massachusetts...

01:42.554 --> 01:46.057
...wins one of the narrowest election
victories in American history...

01:46.141 --> 01:50.687
...over Vice President Richard Nixon
by a little more than 100,000 votes.

01:51.354 --> 01:55.317
Alongside his beautiful
and elegant wife, Jacqueline Bouvier...

01:55.483 --> 01:59.154
...Kennedy is the symbol
of the new freedom of the 1960s...

01:59.321 --> 02:02.616
...signifying change and upheaval
to the American public.

02:02.699 --> 02:04.451
"All men are created equal. "

02:04.534 --> 02:07.787
Every degree of mind and spirit
that I possess will be devoted...

02:08.038 --> 02:10.290
...to the cause of freedom
around the world.

02:10.373 --> 02:12.667
Today, the proudest boast is:

02:13.001 --> 02:14.878
"Ich bin ein Berliner! "

02:15.879 --> 02:20.717
He inherits a secret war against the
Communist Castro dictatorship in Cuba...

02:20.884 --> 02:24.054
...a war run by the CIA
and angry Cuban exiles.

02:24.554 --> 02:26.973
Castro is a successful revolutionary...

02:27.057 --> 02:30.477
...frightening to American business
interests in Latin America.

02:30.560 --> 02:34.022
This war culminates in the disastrous
Bay of Pigs invasion...

02:34.189 --> 02:36.024
...in April, 1961...

02:36.525 --> 02:41.029
...when Kennedy refuses to provide
air cover for the exiled Cuban brigade.

02:41.196 --> 02:44.533
Kennedy takes public responsibility
for the failure.

02:44.658 --> 02:47.494
He privately claims the CIA lied to him...

02:47.577 --> 02:51.998
...and tried to manipulate him into ordering
an American invasion of Cuba.

02:53.875 --> 02:55.794
In October, 1962...

02:56.253 --> 02:59.005
...the world comes to the brink
of nuclear war...

02:59.089 --> 03:01.007
...when Kennedy quarantines Cuba...

03:01.091 --> 03:05.220
...after announcing the presence
of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles...

03:05.428 --> 03:07.514
...90 miles off American shores.

03:07.597 --> 03:10.767
Soviet ships with more missiles
sail towards Cuba...

03:11.059 --> 03:13.353
...but at the last moment they turn back.

03:13.436 --> 03:15.730
The world breathes with relief.

03:15.939 --> 03:19.985
In Washington, rumors abound
that JFK has cut a secret deal...

03:20.151 --> 03:22.153
...with Russian Premier Khrushchev...

03:22.237 --> 03:26.658
...not to invade Cuba in return
for a Russian withdrawal of missiles.

03:26.992 --> 03:30.453
Suspicions abound that Kennedy
is soft on communism.

03:31.788 --> 03:35.542
Kennedy also finds himself embroiled
in Laos and Vietnam.

03:35.917 --> 03:38.086
We've got our difficulties there.

03:38.295 --> 03:41.173
Unless a greater effort is made
by the government...

03:41.256 --> 03:45.010
...to win popular support,
I don't think the war can be won there.

03:45.177 --> 03:49.014
It's their war. They're the ones
who have to win it or lose it.

03:49.264 --> 03:50.891
Early that fateful summer...

03:50.974 --> 03:54.519
...Kennedy speaks of his new vision
at the American University.

03:54.644 --> 03:56.229
What kind of peace do I mean?

03:56.313 --> 03:58.315
What kind of peace do we seek?

03:58.440 --> 04:00.066
Not a Pax Americana...

04:00.442 --> 04:03.904
...enforced on the world
by American weapons of war.

04:04.321 --> 04:08.158
We must re-examine our own attitudes
towards the Soviet Union.

04:08.658 --> 04:10.619
Our most basic, common link...

04:11.119 --> 04:13.163
...is that we all inhabit...

04:13.330 --> 04:14.915
...this small planet.

04:15.290 --> 04:17.167
We all breathe the same air.

04:17.501 --> 04:19.961
We all cherish our children's futures.

04:20.295 --> 04:22.214
And we are all mortal.

04:32.516 --> 04:34.351
You fucking assholes!

04:37.354 --> 04:38.897
Don't leave me here!

04:42.025 --> 04:43.401
They've gone to Dallas.

04:44.152 --> 04:45.153
Friday.

04:47.822 --> 04:49.866
They're going to kill...

04:50.325 --> 04:51.660
...Kennedy.

04:53.495 --> 04:55.038
Call somebody.

04:56.414 --> 04:57.582
Stop them.

05:01.211 --> 05:04.798
These are serious fucking guys.

05:09.886 --> 05:13.223
She's been high on something
since they brought her in.

05:13.390 --> 05:14.558
Help!

05:15.308 --> 05:16.434
Please!

07:11.007 --> 07:13.301
Here is a bulletin from CBS News.

07:14.302 --> 07:16.847
In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired...

07:16.930 --> 07:20.016
...at President Kennedy's motorcade
in downtown Dallas.

07:20.141 --> 07:22.519
The first reports say
that President Kennedy...

07:22.644 --> 07:25.355
...has been seriously wounded
by the shooting.

07:48.545 --> 07:49.713
What's wrong?

07:51.673 --> 07:53.466
The President's been shot.

07:53.925 --> 07:55.886
In Dallas. Five minutes ago.

07:56.344 --> 07:57.596
Oh, no!

08:00.473 --> 08:01.558
How bad?

08:02.017 --> 08:04.561
No word. They think it's in the head.

08:13.195 --> 08:14.905
Napoleon's has a TV set.

08:15.864 --> 08:20.327
Three bullets were found. Gov. Connally
also appeared to have been hit.

08:20.869 --> 08:25.332
The President was rushed to Parkland
Memorial Hospital, four miles away.

08:25.874 --> 08:29.920
We are told the bullet entered the base
of the throat and came out the back...

08:30.003 --> 08:32.255
...but there is no confirmation.

08:32.506 --> 08:36.801
Blood transfusions are being given.
A priest has administered the last rites.

08:39.721 --> 08:41.431
There's still a chance.

08:43.266 --> 08:44.643
Pull through, Jack.

08:44.726 --> 08:45.810
From Dallas...

08:45.936 --> 08:48.063
...the flash, apparently official:

08:48.396 --> 08:50.106
President Kennedy died...

08:50.440 --> 08:53.193
...at 1:00 p. m. Central Standard Time...

08:54.110 --> 08:56.238
...2:00 Eastern Standard Time...

08:56.905 --> 08:58.865
...some 38 minutes ago.

09:04.454 --> 09:07.040
Vice President Johnson
has left the hospital.

09:07.582 --> 09:11.086
Presumably he will take
the oath of office shortly...

09:11.461 --> 09:15.006
...and become the 36th President
of the United States.

09:16.424 --> 09:20.720
He did so much for this country,
for colored people. Why?

09:25.100 --> 09:27.936
Good-bye, you sorry bastard! Die!

09:28.436 --> 09:30.146
Shut the fuck up!

09:31.606 --> 09:34.192
I'm ashamed to be an American today.

09:34.442 --> 09:37.404
The President of the United States is dead.

09:38.446 --> 09:43.034
I just talked to Father Oscar Hubert
of the Holy Trinity Catholic Church.

09:43.493 --> 09:44.953
He told me...

09:45.370 --> 09:49.416
...President Kennedy has been given
the last rites.

09:49.624 --> 09:51.501
Shortly after 12:30...

09:53.628 --> 09:55.922
...near the park in downtown Dallas...

09:56.047 --> 09:57.674
...the shots rang out.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.177
The President is dead.

10:01.553 --> 10:03.805
The bullets came up over our heads...

10:04.514 --> 10:07.058
...from that fence up on the knoll.

10:07.475 --> 10:09.686
I seen his face when it hit.

10:11.188 --> 10:14.900
His ear blew off and he turned real white.

10:18.153 --> 10:20.488
He flopped over on his stomach...

10:23.116 --> 10:25.076
...with his foot sticking out.

10:27.495 --> 10:31.333
None of us thought it could happen
in America or any place else.

10:31.541 --> 10:34.836
All this blubbering over
that no-count son of a bitch!

10:35.128 --> 10:38.632
They're bawling like they knew the man.
Makes me want to puke.

10:39.716 --> 10:42.219
For God's sake, the President was shot.

10:42.552 --> 10:44.179
A bullshit President!

10:44.554 --> 10:47.849
Nobody's crying for the thousands
of Cubans...

10:48.391 --> 10:51.937
...that bastard condemned to death
and torture at Bay of Pigs.

10:52.979 --> 10:54.981
Goddamn peace treaties!

10:55.106 --> 10:57.108
I heard shots from over there.

10:57.609 --> 11:01.154
- I heard shots from over there.
- How many?

11:01.988 --> 11:04.908
That's what happens
when you let the niggers vote.

11:05.951 --> 11:08.954
They get together with the Jews
and the Catholics...

11:09.329 --> 11:11.665
...and elect an Irish bleeding heart.

11:11.957 --> 11:14.417
Chief, maybe you had too much to drink.

11:14.501 --> 11:15.836
Bullshit!

11:16.378 --> 11:18.213
Here's to the New Frontier.

11:19.339 --> 11:21.341
Camelot in smithereens.

11:22.634 --> 11:24.344
I'll drink to that.

11:29.724 --> 11:31.977
Dallas police have just announced...

11:32.060 --> 11:37.190
...they have a suspect in the killing
of Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit...

11:37.524 --> 11:41.111
...who was shot at 1:15 in Oak Cliff,
a Dallas suburb.

11:41.695 --> 11:45.657
Police say there could be a tie-in
to the President's murder.

11:45.740 --> 11:49.035
The suspect,
identified as a Lee Harvey Oswald...

11:49.703 --> 11:52.455
...was arrested by more
than a dozen policemen...

11:52.539 --> 11:56.251
...after a short scuffle at a movie theater
in Oak Cliff.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.504
Officer Tippit was killed...

12:00.630 --> 12:03.216
...by a revolver which was found
on Oswald.

12:05.051 --> 12:06.678
Shoot the bastard!

12:06.803 --> 12:09.181
Give him a medal for shooting Kennedy!

12:12.309 --> 12:14.519
I don't know what I am charged with...

12:15.061 --> 12:17.147
...but I emphatically deny these charges.

12:19.441 --> 12:21.943
The kid must've gone nuts, right?

12:23.528 --> 12:25.697
I said, Oswald must've flipped.

12:25.989 --> 12:27.032
Right?

12:28.074 --> 12:31.578
Just did this crazy thing
before anybody could stop him.

12:31.828 --> 12:34.498
I'm going. I've got to get home, Chief.

12:34.706 --> 12:36.833
What are you talking about?

12:37.501 --> 12:39.252
Who'd have ever thought...

12:39.836 --> 12:44.090
...that goofy Oswald kid would pull
a stunt like an assassination?

12:44.716 --> 12:48.803
Goes to show you can never know
about some people. Am I right, Jack?

12:49.137 --> 12:50.639
Am I right, Jack?

12:50.889 --> 12:52.724
Well, bless my soul.

12:53.767 --> 12:56.937
All these years,
I thought you were on my team.

12:57.604 --> 12:59.272
Are you kidding?

13:00.232 --> 13:02.734
I couldn't be more serious, Jack.

13:03.193 --> 13:06.863
Your little red eyes have me wondering
about your loyalty.

13:15.288 --> 13:17.165
Look at that, Martin.

13:20.544 --> 13:22.712
Who's been going through my files?

13:23.046 --> 13:26.258
You've been looking through my files,
you little weasel!

13:27.008 --> 13:29.928
You're starting to get paranoid. Really!

13:31.179 --> 13:33.181
You went through all my files!

13:33.598 --> 13:34.975
You're a goddamn spy!

13:35.058 --> 13:37.644
Why would I want to look
through your files?

13:37.894 --> 13:40.814
I've seen enough here this summer
to write a book.

13:41.106 --> 13:43.108
I always lock my files!

13:43.525 --> 13:45.527
You're the only one here today.

13:46.152 --> 13:48.488
What do you mean, you bastard?

13:49.030 --> 13:51.157
You're going to write a book?

13:51.241 --> 13:53.076
You know what I mean.

13:54.619 --> 13:57.372
I've seen a lot of strange things here.

13:57.789 --> 13:59.291
Strange people.

14:07.757 --> 14:10.135
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

14:10.385 --> 14:11.845
Not a goddamn thing!

14:12.262 --> 14:14.598
The full name is Lee Harvey Oswald.

14:16.349 --> 14:19.895
- Did you shoot the President?
- I didn't shoot anybody.

14:20.187 --> 14:24.274
They have taken me in
because I have lived in the Soviet Union.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.110
I'm just a patsy!

14:27.819 --> 14:29.988
He sure looks like a creep.

14:30.780 --> 14:34.784
I protested at that time I was not allowed
legal representation...

14:36.203 --> 14:39.289
...during that very short and sweet hearing.

14:39.915 --> 14:41.541
I really don't know...

14:41.708 --> 14:43.502
...what this situation is about.

14:43.585 --> 14:46.755
Nobody has told me anything
except that I am accused...

14:47.297 --> 14:49.090
...of murdering a policeman.

14:49.174 --> 14:50.842
I know nothing more than that.

14:50.926 --> 14:54.638
I do request someone to come forward...

14:55.096 --> 14:57.265
...to give me legal assistance.

14:57.432 --> 15:00.560
Were you ever in the Free Cuba movement
or whatever it's called?

15:00.644 --> 15:03.021
It's the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

15:03.647 --> 15:06.149
Why were you in Russia?
What happened to your eye?

15:06.233 --> 15:09.152
He seems pretty cool
for a man under pressure.

15:09.486 --> 15:10.987
A policeman hit me.

15:11.112 --> 15:12.531
He gives me the willies.

15:12.614 --> 15:15.700
Come on, sugarplums,
it's past your bedtimes.

15:16.576 --> 15:20.247
Mattie, honey, get a hold of yourself.

15:23.834 --> 15:25.252
A fine man.

15:26.962 --> 15:28.922
After a stint in the Marines...

15:29.005 --> 15:33.343
...he became fascinated by communism.
He is said to be a dedicated Marxist...

15:33.718 --> 15:38.056
...and a fanatical supporter of Fidel Castro
and ultra left-wing causes.

15:38.390 --> 15:41.309
He spent last summer in New Orleans
and was arrested...

15:41.393 --> 15:44.062
...in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.

15:47.732 --> 15:50.443
Lou? Sorry to disturb you this late.

15:51.194 --> 15:55.198
Matter of routine. Get on
this Oswald connection in New Orleans.

15:55.907 --> 16:00.162
Check out his record. Find any friends
or associates from last summer.

16:00.579 --> 16:04.082
Let's meet with the investigators
day after tomorrow.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.084
On Sunday?

16:06.168 --> 16:07.752
Sunday. 11:00.

16:08.879 --> 16:10.088
Thanks, Lou.

16:10.297 --> 16:12.924
I would say that he is the killer...

16:13.550 --> 16:16.803
...beyond a reasonable doubt
and to a moral certainty.

16:17.429 --> 16:20.932
I thought a motorcycle had backfired.
I looked to my left.

16:21.183 --> 16:23.268
A second shot hit him in the face.

16:23.351 --> 16:28.356
The rifle, a cheap World War ll,
Italian-made Mannlicher-Carcano...

16:28.440 --> 16:30.942
...was ordered from
a Chicago mailing house...

16:31.026 --> 16:34.196
...and shipped to Oswald's alias,
A. Hidell...

16:34.613 --> 16:37.449
...at a post office box in March of 1963.

16:37.616 --> 16:41.203
This same rifle was used
to assassinate the President.

16:41.536 --> 16:43.205
That ties it up.

16:43.872 --> 16:47.626
Another nut. Jesus Christ,
anybody can get a rifle in Texas!

16:47.792 --> 16:52.380
As far as Oswald's associates,
one name keeps popping up: David Ferrie.

16:52.797 --> 16:55.800
Oswald was seen with him
several times last summer.

16:56.176 --> 16:59.346
I know David. Strange character.

16:59.429 --> 17:03.141
He's been in trouble before. He was
a hot-shot pilot for Eastern Airlines.

17:03.225 --> 17:06.061
Got canned after an alleged
homosexual incident.

17:06.186 --> 17:10.190
These photos were found yesterday
among Oswald's possessions...

17:10.315 --> 17:14.361
...in the garage where Marina Oswald
and her children are living.

17:14.444 --> 17:18.365
Somebody mentioned Ferrie
on that Texas trip. Find that out.

17:18.865 --> 17:20.659
He no shoot anyone.

17:21.409 --> 17:23.453
He good man. Good husband.

17:24.162 --> 17:28.166
So it seems David Ferrie drove off
on Friday afternoon for Texas.

17:28.500 --> 17:31.962
A source said he might have been
a getaway pilot for Oswald.

17:33.421 --> 17:34.923
Hold your horses.

17:35.006 --> 17:36.675
What kind of source?

17:36.925 --> 17:39.010
The anonymous kind, Chief.

17:39.261 --> 17:43.098
I remember Ferrie speaking
at a meeting of some veterans' group...

17:43.265 --> 17:46.226
...ranting against Castro. Extreme stuff.

17:48.311 --> 17:51.273
They're bringing him out.
Numa, turn it up.

17:52.315 --> 17:53.650
Here he comes!

17:59.406 --> 18:01.491
Anything to say in your defense?

18:02.158 --> 18:03.410
Oswald!

18:05.453 --> 18:06.705
He shot him!

18:09.040 --> 18:10.458
He shot him on TV!

18:13.879 --> 18:15.422
There's a man with a gun!

18:17.465 --> 18:19.968
Seventy cops there.
What were they doing?

18:21.761 --> 18:26.224
No trial now. Somebody just saved
the Dallas DA a pile of work.

18:32.272 --> 18:34.941
Let's get David Ferrie in here anyway.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.569
It's wrong. This is crazy!

18:52.542 --> 18:56.546
Yesterday, in the midst of sorrow,
the business of government went on.

18:57.130 --> 19:01.384
The President met with Henry Cabot Lodge,
our Ambassador to Vietnam...

19:02.052 --> 19:03.678
...and members of his Cabinet.

19:03.762 --> 19:05.847
The major subject was Vietnam...

19:06.139 --> 19:08.975
...a crisis that does not pause
for bereavement.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.477
From this meeting...

19:10.560 --> 19:14.773
...came affirmations that
the US would continue aiding...

19:14.856 --> 19:19.319
...the new government of Vietnam in
its war against the Communist insurgents.

19:26.243 --> 19:27.702
David Ferrie.

19:29.371 --> 19:30.539
Come on in.

19:31.706 --> 19:33.124
Thanks for coming.

19:33.208 --> 19:37.546
Remember me? We met
on Carondelet Street after your election.

19:38.171 --> 19:41.049
I remember.
You make quite an impression.

19:41.383 --> 19:44.094
I've heard you're a first-rate pilot.

19:45.095 --> 19:48.557
Legend has it you can get in
and out of the smallest field.

19:49.099 --> 19:53.270
I'm a pilot myself. Flew grasshoppers
for the field artillery in the war.

19:54.229 --> 19:55.981
Make yourself comfortable.

19:57.983 --> 19:59.484
Mind if I smoke?

20:00.110 --> 20:01.319
How could I?

20:02.445 --> 20:05.740
As you know, President Kennedy
was assassinated on Friday.

20:05.824 --> 20:09.119
A man named Lee Harvey Oswald
was arrested as a suspect...

20:09.411 --> 20:12.455
...then murdered yesterday
by a man named Jack Ruby.

20:13.290 --> 20:16.251
We've had reports that Oswald
spent the summer here...

20:16.334 --> 20:18.461
...and that you knew Oswald.

20:19.171 --> 20:23.341
I've never met anyone named Oswald.
Anyone who told you that has to be crazy.

20:23.425 --> 20:27.012
He served in your Civil Air Patrol unit
when he was a teenager.

20:27.762 --> 20:29.890
If he did, I don't remember him.

20:30.765 --> 20:32.475
Lots of boys in and out.

20:32.684 --> 20:36.479
Surely you've seen this. Perhaps
you knew him under another name?

20:39.191 --> 20:41.359
I never saw him before in my life.

20:42.944 --> 20:45.655
Then we must have gotten
mistaken information.

20:46.072 --> 20:48.158
Thanks for straightening it out.

20:50.202 --> 20:52.287
There's one other matter.

20:54.414 --> 20:58.835
We heard you went to Texas
shortly after the assassination on Friday.

20:59.461 --> 21:01.379
True. I drove to Houston.

21:01.671 --> 21:03.924
What was so appealing about Houston?

21:04.257 --> 21:07.844
I hadn't been ice-skating lately.
Some young friends and I...

21:08.220 --> 21:09.971
...decided to go skating.

21:10.096 --> 21:12.641
Why the urge to ice-skate in Texas...

21:12.766 --> 21:16.102
...during one of the worst thunderstorms
in recent memory?

21:18.980 --> 21:20.732
Spur-of-the-moment thing.

21:20.857 --> 21:22.567
Storm wasn't that bad.

21:24.653 --> 21:26.154
Where did you drive?

21:26.238 --> 21:27.405
We went to Houston.

21:28.365 --> 21:30.992
Saturday we drove to Galveston,
and stayed there.

21:31.451 --> 21:32.869
And Sunday?

21:33.829 --> 21:36.206
In the morning, we went goose hunting.

21:36.790 --> 21:38.124
Did you bag any?

21:38.917 --> 21:40.585
The boys got a couple.

21:40.752 --> 21:42.712
Boys said they didn't get any.

21:46.216 --> 21:47.467
They're right.

21:47.717 --> 21:51.429
There were thousands
of geese everywhere.

21:52.597 --> 21:55.433
But you couldn't approach them.
They're wise.

21:56.935 --> 21:59.604
Your friends said you had no weapons.

22:00.313 --> 22:03.483
Isn't it difficult to hunt geese
without a shotgun?

22:08.780 --> 22:10.824
I remember now. I'm sorry.

22:11.491 --> 22:12.742
I got confused.

22:12.868 --> 22:17.164
We got near the geese, then realized
we had forgotten our shotguns.

22:18.290 --> 22:19.541
Stupid, right?

22:20.375 --> 22:23.170
So, of course, we didn't get any geese.

22:24.171 --> 22:26.214
Thank you for your time.

22:27.382 --> 22:29.593
Sorry this must end inconveniently...

22:29.676 --> 22:33.096
...but I must detain you for questioning
by the FBl.

22:33.889 --> 22:35.140
Why? What's wrong?

22:35.223 --> 22:37.184
Your story is not believable.

22:39.060 --> 22:40.312
Really?

22:43.648 --> 22:44.983
What part?

23:04.794 --> 23:08.131
This afternoon the FBI released
David W. Ferrie...

23:08.757 --> 23:10.091
...of New Orleans.

23:10.175 --> 23:13.261
After extensive questioning
and a background check...

23:13.345 --> 23:17.974
...the Bureau found no evidence
that Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald...

23:18.975 --> 23:22.229
...or had any connection
with the assassination.

23:23.271 --> 23:26.191
The agent in charge would like
to make clear...

23:26.650 --> 23:29.194
...that Ferrie was brought in
for questioning...

23:29.319 --> 23:32.155
...by the District Attorney
of Orleans Parish.

23:32.989 --> 23:35.200
I thought we were on the same side.

23:35.325 --> 23:37.077
Why are they saying that?

23:37.244 --> 23:39.538
Pretty fast, the way they let him go.

23:40.455 --> 23:42.582
They must know something we don't.

23:43.834 --> 23:45.794
So let's get on with our lives.

23:46.461 --> 23:48.588
We have many homegrown crimes
to prosecute.

23:48.713 --> 23:50.340
The President has announced...

23:50.423 --> 23:53.927
...the creation of a commission
to probe the events in Dallas.

23:55.345 --> 23:58.598
It will be headed
by Chief Justice Earl Warren...

23:59.474 --> 24:03.937
...and is expected to head off
several Congressional and Texas inquiries.

24:04.354 --> 24:07.440
On the panel are Allen Dulles,
ex-chief of the CIA...

24:07.816 --> 24:11.319
...Representative Gerald Ford,
banker John McCloy...

24:15.824 --> 24:20.287
Fucking out of control.
All these hippies running around on drugs.

24:21.121 --> 24:24.040
You can't tell a boy from a girl anymore.

24:25.041 --> 24:29.421
I saw a girl the other day. Pregnant.
You could see her whole belly.

24:29.963 --> 24:33.300
You know what she had painted on it?
"Love Child. "

24:39.264 --> 24:40.891
It's a mess down there, Jim.

24:41.266 --> 24:44.436
We've bitten off more Vietnam
than we can chew.

24:44.644 --> 24:48.231
It figures with that polecat Lyndon
in the White House.

24:50.025 --> 24:54.070
I sometimes think things have gone
downhill since Kennedy died.

24:55.238 --> 24:56.865
Don't get me started on that.

24:56.990 --> 25:00.869
Those Warren Commission fellows
were picking gnat shit out of pepper.

25:01.161 --> 25:05.290
Nobody's going to tell me that kid
shot like he did from that bookstore.

25:08.001 --> 25:11.254
But the FBI test-fired the rifle
to see if it could be done.

25:11.338 --> 25:14.257
Three experts and not one
of them could do it.

25:14.758 --> 25:18.887
They say that Oswald got off three shots
with world-class precision...

25:19.304 --> 25:22.724
...from a manual bolt-action rifle
in less than six seconds.

25:23.183 --> 25:26.436
According to his Marine buddies,
he got Maggie's drawers.

25:26.811 --> 25:29.105
That means he wasn't any good.

25:29.648 --> 25:32.150
Average man would be lucky
to shoot twice.

25:32.275 --> 25:34.653
And the first would be the best.

25:35.320 --> 25:37.280
Here the third shot's perfect.

25:37.531 --> 25:40.534
And they got that bullet zigzagging
all over the place...

25:40.617 --> 25:42.786
...hitting Kennedy and Connally
seven times.

25:44.329 --> 25:47.249
One pristine bullet? That dog don't hunt.

25:50.252 --> 25:53.380
Something's always bothered me
about that from day one.

25:54.673 --> 25:56.967
Think other men were involved?

25:57.968 --> 26:02.430
If I was investigating the case, I'd round
up 100 of the world's best riflemen...

26:02.931 --> 26:05.517
...and find out which ones were
in Dallas that day.

26:05.642 --> 26:09.104
You been duck hunting.
Oswald's an old-fashioned decoy.

26:09.354 --> 26:12.607
What did he say? "I'm just a patsy! "
Believe it.

26:24.661 --> 26:26.746
Dinner's just about ready.

26:28.331 --> 26:31.751
Got a surprise for you tonight.
Tried something new.

26:38.258 --> 26:39.801
- What?
- Dinner.

26:41.344 --> 26:43.638
Smells good. Do you know Oswald...

26:43.763 --> 26:46.933
...was interrogated for 12 hours
after the assassination...

26:47.017 --> 26:50.937
...with no lawyer present,
and nobody recorded a word of it.

26:52.022 --> 26:56.276
I can't believe it. An experienced
police captain and a crowd of FBI agents...

26:56.359 --> 27:00.739
...had to know that with no record,
what Oswald said is inadmissible in court.

27:01.448 --> 27:04.117
Let's talk at the table. It's getting cold.

27:04.409 --> 27:06.161
What are you doing here?

27:06.495 --> 27:08.705
Daddy said it's okay if I'm quiet.

27:09.164 --> 27:10.332
Sure it is.

27:10.499 --> 27:13.668
If I handled a minor felon that way,
it'd be all over the papers.

27:13.752 --> 27:15.921
This is the alleged murderer
of the President.

27:22.886 --> 27:25.680
Again and again
credible testimony's ignored.

27:26.223 --> 27:30.894
Leads are not followed up,
conclusions are selective, no index.

27:30.977 --> 27:34.689
It's the sloppiest investigation
I've ever seen.

27:35.732 --> 27:39.069
Dozens of witnesses heard the shots...

27:39.194 --> 27:41.905
...coming from the grassy knoll
in front of Kennedy...

27:41.988 --> 27:44.407
...not the Book Depository behind him.

27:45.033 --> 27:49.246
But it's broken down and spread around.
You read it, but the point is lost.

27:49.871 --> 27:51.498
I never believed it.

27:52.123 --> 27:54.751
I'll do the dishes. You take Eb up.

27:56.169 --> 27:58.380
Elizabeth, your bedtime too!

27:58.839 --> 28:02.759
That was three years ago.
We've tried to put it out of our minds.

28:02.926 --> 28:04.886
You keep digging it up.

28:05.470 --> 28:07.347
You're the DA of New Orleans.

28:07.430 --> 28:10.725
Isn't the Kennedy assassination
a bit out of your domain?

28:11.643 --> 28:13.687
All those important people studied it.

28:13.770 --> 28:17.899
I can't believe a man as intelligent
as Earl Warren read those volumes.

28:19.734 --> 28:21.236
Maybe you're right.

28:21.653 --> 28:25.949
You got an hour to solve the case
while I get the kids in bed.

28:26.825 --> 28:30.495
Then you're mine. Mr. Kennedy
will have to wait until morning.

28:35.625 --> 28:37.919
Look, Dad. Look what I drew.

28:38.211 --> 28:40.213
That's something. What is it?

28:40.380 --> 28:42.132
It's a rhino in a cage.

28:42.674 --> 28:45.594
- Can I stay up another hour?
- I don't think so, Son.

28:45.677 --> 28:47.971
Pickle and Snapper, my two...

28:49.097 --> 28:50.390
...dancing partners.

28:50.473 --> 28:52.475
Good night, doodlebugs.

28:53.268 --> 28:55.061
One hour, you hear?

28:55.770 --> 28:57.939
Some Saturday-night date you are.

28:58.315 --> 29:02.903
Mama warned me this would happen
if I married such a serious man as you.

29:03.486 --> 29:07.115
When I come up, I'll show you
how Saturday night got invented.

29:31.556 --> 29:35.977
I sealed off the area and held off the
trains till they could be examined.

29:36.311 --> 29:39.689
There were some transients taken on
at least one train.

29:41.525 --> 29:46.738
Mr. Bowers, you already talked to us
about this matter. Is that correct?

29:47.072 --> 29:48.031
Yes.

29:48.406 --> 29:50.659
Is there anything else you told us...

29:50.742 --> 29:54.037
...that I haven't asked you about,
that you can think of?

29:55.205 --> 29:56.998
Nothing that I can recall.

29:57.999 --> 29:59.584
Witness is excused.

30:01.378 --> 30:02.796
A long freight was in there...

30:02.879 --> 30:05.882
...and we pulled some people off
and took them to the station.

30:09.803 --> 30:11.388
Do you mean some transients?

30:11.763 --> 30:13.139
Tramps and hobos.

30:13.223 --> 30:14.808
Were they questioned?

30:15.058 --> 30:17.435
They were questioned at the station.

30:18.478 --> 30:19.896
Ask the question.

30:20.856 --> 30:23.400
Let's go back to that Amos Euins matter.

30:24.943 --> 30:28.655
Traffic had been cut off
into the area since 10:00.

30:28.864 --> 30:32.242
But three cars came in during this time...

30:33.326 --> 30:36.246
...from around noon till the time
of the shooting.

30:36.746 --> 30:39.291
They circled the parking lot and left.

30:39.833 --> 30:41.918
Like they was checking the area.

30:43.044 --> 30:44.713
One of the drivers...

30:44.921 --> 30:47.674
...was holding something up to his mouth.

30:49.426 --> 30:55.265
The last car came in about seven
to ten minutes before the shooting.

30:56.224 --> 30:59.186
It was a white Chevrolet four-door Impala.

31:00.187 --> 31:01.897
Muddy up to the windows.

31:03.690 --> 31:06.735
Towards the underpass, I saw two men...

31:07.027 --> 31:09.654
...standing behind a picket fence...

31:10.113 --> 31:14.409
...looking up towards Main and Houston,
as the caravan came down.

31:16.536 --> 31:18.538
One of them was middle-aged...

31:18.663 --> 31:19.956
...heavyset.

31:20.707 --> 31:22.501
The other man was younger.

31:23.293 --> 31:26.421
Two other men were on the east end
of the parking lot.

31:26.713 --> 31:28.548
They both had uniforms.

31:29.174 --> 31:31.176
At the time of the shooting...

31:31.760 --> 31:34.471
...there seemed to be some commotion.

31:36.473 --> 31:38.850
I'm just unable to describe...

31:40.435 --> 31:43.396
...a flash of light or smoke or something...

31:44.439 --> 31:47.567
...which caused me to feel that something
out of the ordinary...

31:47.651 --> 31:49.653
...had occurred on the embankment.

31:49.945 --> 31:50.987
Goddamn.

32:08.421 --> 32:09.422
No!

32:14.719 --> 32:17.138
- You all right?
- Honey, it's incredible.

32:18.223 --> 32:19.099
What?

32:20.016 --> 32:21.393
The whole thing.

32:22.227 --> 32:24.271
A Lt. Colonel testifies that...

32:24.521 --> 32:28.275
...Oswald had a Russian language exam
as part of his Marine training...

32:28.358 --> 32:31.736
...only a few months before he defects
to the Soviet Union.

32:32.112 --> 32:33.697
A Russian exam.

32:34.072 --> 32:38.702
It's 4:30 in the morning!
I have five kids who'll wake up in an hour.

32:38.785 --> 32:43.331
In all my years in the military, I never
knew a single man who had a Russian test.

32:44.416 --> 32:46.418
Oswald was a radar operator.

32:46.835 --> 32:50.213
He'd have about as much use for Russian
as a cat has for pajamas.

32:50.297 --> 32:52.924
These books have gotten to your mind!

32:53.592 --> 32:56.595
- Stop reading.
- He makes it sound like nothing.

32:56.887 --> 32:58.847
Oswald did badly on his test.

32:59.222 --> 33:02.434
He got only two more Russian words right
than wrong.

33:02.851 --> 33:06.396
That's like me saying,
Touchdown is not very intelligent...

33:06.479 --> 33:09.983
...because I beat him three games
out of five when we played chess.

33:10.650 --> 33:14.488
Are you going to stay up all night,
every night? For what?

33:15.071 --> 33:18.366
To be the only man who's read
all 26 volumes of the Warren Report?

33:18.450 --> 33:20.577
Do I have to spell it out for you?

33:21.828 --> 33:24.122
Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.

33:25.290 --> 33:28.752
He was in military intelligence,
that's why he was trained in Russian.

33:28.835 --> 33:31.004
It was no accident he was in Russia.

33:31.087 --> 33:34.716
- Go back to sleep.
- I've been sleeping for three years!

33:52.776 --> 33:55.445
'Morning boys. Ready for a walking tour?

33:55.570 --> 33:59.115
7:30 Sunday morning?
Not exactly fresh blood we're sniffing.

33:59.574 --> 34:01.701
Old stains, but just as telling.

34:09.543 --> 34:11.419
531 Lafayette Street.

34:12.045 --> 34:14.422
Remember whose office this was in '63?

34:15.799 --> 34:17.634
Sure. Guy Banister.

34:18.218 --> 34:21.179
Ex-FBI man. Died a couple of years ago.

34:23.723 --> 34:27.978
He headed the Chicago office. When he
retired he became a private eye here.

34:28.478 --> 34:32.023
I used to have lunch with him.
John Birch Society, Minutemen.

34:32.566 --> 34:34.609
To the right of Attila the Hun.

34:34.860 --> 34:38.488
Recruited students to infiltrate
radical organizations on campus.

34:39.531 --> 34:42.450
Headed the Anti-Communist League
of the Caribbean.

34:42.951 --> 34:44.703
All out of this office.

34:48.081 --> 34:50.041
I want to show you something.

34:58.341 --> 34:59.885
Take a look here.

35:00.468 --> 35:02.137
544 Camp Street.

35:03.305 --> 35:05.182
531 Lafayette Street.

35:05.849 --> 35:07.517
Same building, right?

35:07.893 --> 35:11.980
Different addresses, different entrances,
both going to the same place...

35:12.314 --> 35:14.191
...to the office upstairs.

35:14.774 --> 35:16.359
Guess who used it?

35:18.820 --> 35:20.280
Lee Harvey Oswald.

35:21.740 --> 35:23.492
How do we know that?

35:23.909 --> 35:25.744
This address was stamped on...

35:25.827 --> 35:30.499
...pro-Castro leaflets he handed out
in the summer of '63 on Canal Street.

35:30.957 --> 35:34.002
The same leaflets they found
in his garage in Dallas.

35:36.588 --> 35:40.884
After the arrest, 544 Camp St.
never appeared on the pamphlets again.

35:42.344 --> 35:45.430
He was arrested for fighting
with anti-Castro Cubans.

35:46.723 --> 35:48.600
But he'd contacted them already...

35:48.683 --> 35:52.270
...as an ex-Marine trying
to join their anti-Castro crusade.

35:53.104 --> 35:57.275
When they heard he was now pro-Castro,
they paid him a visit.

35:57.943 --> 36:00.695
What's this Fidel shit? You lied to me!

36:01.988 --> 36:03.573
Liar! Son of a bitch!

36:04.115 --> 36:06.660
Do not take this Communist propaganda!

36:07.661 --> 36:09.371
If you want to hit me, hit me.

36:09.454 --> 36:10.956
You pinko shit!

36:11.248 --> 36:12.707
Go back to Moscow!

36:13.208 --> 36:14.835
There was no real fight.

36:14.918 --> 36:18.839
The arresting Lieutenant later said
he felt it was a staged incident.

36:19.381 --> 36:21.800
In jail, Oswald has a private session...

36:21.883 --> 36:24.594
...with Special Agent John Quigley
of the FBl.

36:25.679 --> 36:27.180
Oswald is released.

36:27.305 --> 36:30.225
And Quigley destroys his notes
from the interview.

36:30.433 --> 36:33.144
The arrest gets Oswald a lot of publicity.

36:33.812 --> 36:36.064
And he appears on a local TV debate.

36:36.773 --> 36:38.567
You are a Communist, are you not?

36:38.650 --> 36:43.655
No, Mr. Bringuier. I am not a Communist.
I'm a Marxist-Leninist.

36:43.738 --> 36:47.909
Communist, Marxist-Leninist,
what's the difference?

36:48.910 --> 36:53.874
What if I told you Oswald was trained
in the Russian language in the Marines?

36:54.291 --> 36:56.626
I'd say he got intelligence training.

36:56.710 --> 36:58.795
You were a Marine. Who'd run it?

36:58.879 --> 37:00.839
Office of Naval Intelligence.

37:01.381 --> 37:03.133
Look across the street.

37:04.009 --> 37:05.177
Post Office.

37:05.719 --> 37:09.389
Upstairs, in 1963,
that was the Office of Naval Intelligence.

37:10.348 --> 37:13.602
By coincidence, Banister,
before he was FBl, was ONl.

37:14.186 --> 37:15.770
What's their saying?

37:15.937 --> 37:17.731
"Once ONl, always ONl. "

37:18.064 --> 37:20.525
He likes working near his old pals.

37:24.070 --> 37:25.739
We are standing in the heart...

37:25.822 --> 37:29.451
...of the US government's intelligence
community in New Orleans.

37:29.784 --> 37:31.036
That's the FBl.

37:31.328 --> 37:32.412
That's the CIA.

37:32.829 --> 37:34.498
That's the Secret Service.

37:34.581 --> 37:35.707
That's the ONl.

37:35.790 --> 37:38.210
Isn't this a strange place...

37:38.293 --> 37:40.879
...for a Communist
to spend his spare time?

37:44.174 --> 37:45.884
What are you driving at?

37:49.179 --> 37:51.223
We're going back into the case.

37:52.140 --> 37:53.725
The murder of the President.

37:53.808 --> 37:56.144
Lord, wake me. I must be dreaming.

37:56.561 --> 37:58.688
You're awake. I'm deadly serious.

37:59.147 --> 38:02.526
Let's track down your anonymous source
from three years ago.

38:02.609 --> 38:05.821
How'd you find out David Ferrie drove
to Texas that day?

38:05.987 --> 38:09.574
I can't remember last night,
let alone three years ago, Boss.

38:14.329 --> 38:16.373
You're not being cross-examined.

38:16.456 --> 38:20.794
I need clarification about the night
Guy Banister beat you over the head.

38:21.336 --> 38:23.505
Don't tell me you don't remember.

38:23.713 --> 38:28.426
You called our office from your hospital
bed. You were hopping mad about it.

38:29.594 --> 38:31.054
Here's my problem.

38:31.596 --> 38:34.933
You told me you and Guy were
good friends for a long time.

38:35.183 --> 38:37.727
- Over ten years.
- And he never hit you before?

38:37.853 --> 38:39.271
Never touched me.

38:39.896 --> 38:42.065
Yet, on November 22, 1963...

38:42.148 --> 38:44.526
...the day of the President's murder...

38:44.609 --> 38:46.528
...the police report says...

38:47.279 --> 38:50.282
...he pistol-whipped you
with a. 357 Magnum.

38:51.074 --> 38:54.244
It also says you argued
about the phone bill. Look!

38:55.620 --> 38:59.791
Is an argument over a phone bill
a believable explanation to you?

39:02.878 --> 39:04.379
There's more to it.

39:05.922 --> 39:07.174
How much more?

39:07.883 --> 39:09.301
I shouldn't talk about it.

39:09.384 --> 39:12.637
I'd ask Guy. We were friendly.
Heart attack?

39:13.346 --> 39:15.182
You buy what you read in the papers.

39:15.265 --> 39:18.518
- You have other information?
- I didn't say that!

39:18.602 --> 39:23.940
All I know is he died suddenly.
Just before the Warren Report came out.

39:25.901 --> 39:27.694
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

39:35.619 --> 39:37.287
You were the only one here!

39:37.370 --> 39:39.080
The only one here!

39:43.877 --> 39:46.004
You didn't see a goddamn thing!

39:46.671 --> 39:50.675
Hell, Guy's dead, so it don't matter
no more. It was all about those...

39:51.760 --> 39:55.013
...people that was hanging
around the office that summer.

39:56.264 --> 39:58.308
I was never part of the operation.

39:58.391 --> 40:02.229
I just handled their private-eye work
as it came in for Guy.

40:02.562 --> 40:05.106
Not much did, but that's why I was there.

40:07.067 --> 40:08.527
It was a nuthouse.

40:09.694 --> 40:13.907
Cubans coming, going. And Christ,
they all looked the same to me.

40:15.492 --> 40:18.161
You going to play with
this rifle or pack it?

40:18.411 --> 40:19.788
Dave Ferrie.

40:19.996 --> 40:23.333
- You know about him?
- We know Dave. Was he there?

40:24.251 --> 40:26.044
He practically lived there.

40:27.963 --> 40:29.756
The whole thing was...

40:30.549 --> 40:32.509
...all cloak-and-dagger stuff.

40:32.676 --> 40:34.886
They called it "Operation Mongoose. "

40:36.721 --> 40:40.851
The idea was to train these Cuban exiles
for another invasion of Cuba.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.396
Banister's office was part
of the supply line...

40:44.479 --> 40:46.982
...from Dallas through New Orleans
to Miami.

40:47.107 --> 40:49.067
We stockpiled arms, explosives.

40:49.484 --> 40:52.821
In view of the intelligence community
in Lafayette Square?

40:53.029 --> 40:57.242
Yes. Everybody knew everybody.
They were all part of the network.

40:57.617 --> 40:59.411
All worked for the CIA.

41:00.287 --> 41:05.292
Pilots and black operators
and civilians and the military.

41:05.876 --> 41:07.919
Everybody was running guns then.

41:08.879 --> 41:11.965
Ft. Jefferson, Bayou Bluff,
Morgan City, you name it.

41:12.257 --> 41:15.260
McAllen, Texas? Big gun-run operation.

41:19.598 --> 41:21.975
Where does Banister fit in?

41:22.142 --> 41:24.895
He was running his camp
north of Lake Pontchartrain.

41:25.020 --> 41:26.813
Ferrie did a lot of the training.

41:26.938 --> 41:31.485
They had a shooting range
and tropical territory, like in Cuba.

41:32.152 --> 41:34.446
Some Americans were trained there too.

41:34.571 --> 41:36.448
Nazi types. Mercenaries.

41:37.574 --> 41:40.660
That Ferrie, though,
Jesus, he was the craziest.

41:42.078 --> 41:47.167
Late summer the party was over.
Kennedy didn't want another Bay of Pigs.

41:48.668 --> 41:50.879
He told the FBl, "Shut up the camp.

41:51.213 --> 41:53.715
"Confiscate the napalm, C-4 and all. "

41:54.341 --> 41:57.469
The G-men were just going
through the motions.

41:58.428 --> 42:01.431
Their hearts were still
with their old FBI buddy Banister.

42:04.100 --> 42:05.310
Oswald?

42:10.065 --> 42:11.733
He was there too.

42:12.943 --> 42:15.028
Sometimes meeting with Banister.

42:18.365 --> 42:19.825
With the door shut.

42:22.494 --> 42:26.414
Shootin' the bull with Ferrie, whatever.
But he was there, all right.

42:26.623 --> 42:28.333
Anything more specific, Jack?

42:28.917 --> 42:30.168
It's important.

42:33.755 --> 42:36.508
One time, the secretary got upset.

42:36.633 --> 42:39.970
I can't believe it, Mr. Banister,
Oswald is down on Canal Street...

42:40.053 --> 42:43.181
...handing out Communist leaflets
supporting Castro.

42:48.019 --> 42:50.605
It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.

42:53.316 --> 42:54.901
Was anyone else involved at...

42:54.985 --> 42:56.528
...Banister's level?

42:57.487 --> 42:59.281
One guy. I don't know who.

43:00.323 --> 43:02.033
Big. White hair.

43:02.993 --> 43:06.329
I saw him in the office once.
He looked out of place.

43:06.746 --> 43:08.665
You know, a society guy.

43:09.291 --> 43:12.169
Can't remember his name,
but Oswald was with him.

43:13.962 --> 43:17.799
He had something to do with money,
because Banister never kissed ass...

43:17.883 --> 43:19.759
...but he kissed his.

43:27.267 --> 43:28.476
Clay something.

43:28.560 --> 43:30.478
That was his name. Clay...

43:30.562 --> 43:31.897
- Bertrand?
- Yeah.

43:31.980 --> 43:34.274
- Clay Bertrand?
- I don't know.

43:34.858 --> 43:36.776
- Maybe not.
- No, that's right.

43:36.860 --> 43:37.944
I must go.

43:38.528 --> 43:41.573
He was in the Warren Report.
He got Oswald a lawyer.

43:42.532 --> 43:43.825
Was Kennedy discussed?

43:43.909 --> 43:45.160
I don't know.

43:45.994 --> 43:47.746
- The assassination?
- No.

43:47.871 --> 43:50.248
- Not with me. I've got to go.
- Hold on.

43:50.457 --> 43:53.001
- That's all I'll say.
- What's the problem?

43:57.255 --> 43:59.341
Do I have to spell it out for you?

43:59.424 --> 44:02.010
Nobody knows what
we're talking about here.

44:03.678 --> 44:05.263
You are so naive.

44:15.857 --> 44:19.861
- When'd you do business with Bertrand?
- Pipe the bimbo in red.

44:21.822 --> 44:24.783
- Lawdy.
- She's not as cute as you.

44:26.076 --> 44:30.121
- You should try a legitimate business.
- Why are you dancing on my head?

44:30.247 --> 44:33.542
- We've been friends since law school.
- Because you're conning me.

44:33.625 --> 44:36.044
- I read your testimony.
- Grain of salt.

44:36.336 --> 44:40.131
You said Clay Bertrand called you
the day after the assassination...

44:40.215 --> 44:43.468
- ... and asked you to be Oswald's lawyer.
- Right.

44:44.636 --> 44:46.388
That's pretty important.

44:46.847 --> 44:51.476
You told the FBI he's 6' 2".
Then you tell the Commission he's 5' 8".

44:51.768 --> 44:54.312
How the hell does a man shrink like that?

44:54.729 --> 44:59.234
They put the heat on me, like you. I gave
them whatever popped in my cabeza.

44:59.776 --> 45:01.820
Truth is, I never met the dude.

45:03.155 --> 45:05.657
- One likes friends that have friends.
- Indeed.

45:05.740 --> 45:08.910
I don't know what that cat looks like
or where he's at.

45:09.035 --> 45:11.788
All I know is sometimes
he sends me some cases.

45:12.122 --> 45:15.750
One day he calls, talks to me
about repping Oswald in Dallas.

45:16.001 --> 45:18.461
- You ever speak to Oswald in Dallas?
- No.

45:18.545 --> 45:22.174
I told that Bertrand cat right off
this ain't my scene.

45:22.340 --> 45:26.887
- I'm a hack. He needs a hot dog.
- Then how did you get in the Commission?

45:27.596 --> 45:29.723
Like I told the Washington boys...

45:29.890 --> 45:33.935
...Bertrand asked me that summer to help
the kid upgrade his Marine discharge.

45:34.019 --> 45:38.273
Mr. Bertrand said
he would take care of any of-

45:38.356 --> 45:39.107
Fine.

45:39.191 --> 45:43.236
- To whom am I speaking?
- Clay Bertrand. I'll pay what they owe.

45:43.403 --> 45:47.866
There was no conspiracy. If there was,
why didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute?

45:48.116 --> 45:49.910
He was his brother.

45:50.660 --> 45:53.246
How'd so many people keep such a secret?

45:53.997 --> 45:57.751
- It was Oswald. He hated-
- We're having a communication problem.

45:57.834 --> 46:02.589
I know you know who Clay Bertrand is.
Stop eating that crabmeat and listen.

46:02.797 --> 46:07.344
I'm aware of our friendship,
but I'll call you before the grand jury.

46:08.011 --> 46:11.932
You lie to them as you lied to me,
I'll charge you with perjury.

46:12.182 --> 46:14.768
I took nine judges on here in New Orleans.

46:14.851 --> 46:17.771
I beat them all.
Am I communicating with you?

46:19.815 --> 46:21.316
Off the record?

46:23.318 --> 46:25.695
In that case, let me sum it up for you.

46:30.200 --> 46:32.869
If I answer that question you keep asking...

46:33.787 --> 46:36.665
...if I give you the name
of the big enchilada...

46:37.874 --> 46:40.168
...then it's bon voyage, Deano.

46:40.544 --> 46:42.712
Like a bullet in my head, you dig?

46:42.921 --> 46:46.716
You're a mouse fighting a gorilla.
JFK's dead as that crabmeat.

46:47.217 --> 46:49.886
The government's still breathing.

46:50.345 --> 46:53.515
Either you give the grand jury
Clay Bertrand's real identity...

46:53.598 --> 46:56.393
...or your fat behind's
going to the slammer.

46:56.726 --> 47:00.063
You're as crazy as your mama.
It's in the genes.

47:00.564 --> 47:02.899
Do you know what you're getting into?

47:03.483 --> 47:07.779
The government will jump all over
your head and go cock-a-doodle-doo.

47:08.488 --> 47:10.073
Good day to you, sir.

47:15.495 --> 47:18.540
District Attorney Garrison
to see Prisoner 5388.

47:18.999 --> 47:20.667
Ward block 237B.

47:34.431 --> 47:36.641
We don't need gates with that swamp.

47:37.767 --> 47:40.687
Many of them gone in there,
none of them came out.

47:55.160 --> 47:58.371
You got visitors here.
Don't give them trouble.

47:59.080 --> 48:01.958
- How you doing, Mr. Broussard?
- Let's go, Willie.

48:14.054 --> 48:16.431
Thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.

48:17.098 --> 48:18.850
I got nothing but time.

48:19.643 --> 48:21.937
Minutes, hours, days. Years of it.

48:22.395 --> 48:26.733
Time stands still here,
like a snake sunning itself.

48:27.275 --> 48:28.527
Clay Bertrand?

48:32.280 --> 48:34.491
I met him sometime in...

48:34.866 --> 48:37.702
...June of '62. The Masquerade Bar.

48:38.161 --> 48:41.039
Dave Ferrie took me there
expressly to meet him.

48:41.581 --> 48:42.958
Sexual purposes?

48:44.417 --> 48:45.669
Did he pay you?

48:46.002 --> 48:49.506
$20 each time. Ain't no secret.
That's what I'm in here for.

48:49.589 --> 48:51.174
Anything unusual about him...

48:51.258 --> 48:53.593
...you'd be able to describe in court?

48:53.677 --> 48:56.972
He had something wrong with his leg,
a limp.

48:57.097 --> 49:00.016
Don't get me wrong.
He's not one of those limp wrists.

49:00.100 --> 49:03.144
He's a butch John. Meet him on the street,
you'd never snap.

49:03.270 --> 49:07.899
You could play poker with him,
go fishing, you'd never snap.

49:08.316 --> 49:10.777
One night we were at David Ferrie's...

49:11.027 --> 49:13.864
...sometime late in the summer of '63.

49:15.574 --> 49:18.285
There was about nine to ten people there.

49:18.410 --> 49:22.873
Cuban. Friends who'd done stuff
in the bush with him. Place was a mess.

49:23.165 --> 49:26.084
Dave's mind was a mess.
He had caged mice...

49:26.543 --> 49:29.045
...'cause he's working on a cancer cure.

49:30.338 --> 49:33.341
Dave's smart, though.
Speaks five languages.

49:33.884 --> 49:38.305
Knows philosophy, medicine,
military history, politics.

49:38.805 --> 49:42.893
He wanted to be a priest.
They defrocked him 'cause he was queer.

49:43.185 --> 49:45.437
That's where you first met Oswald?

49:46.062 --> 49:48.565
Strange guy. Dave introduced him as...

49:48.648 --> 49:49.941
Leon Oswald.

49:50.275 --> 49:51.610
How you doing?

49:52.569 --> 49:54.613
What the fuck is he doing here?

49:54.696 --> 49:56.406
Fuck you, motherfucker.

49:58.575 --> 50:01.495
Leon's in a bad mood. Don't get excited.

50:02.120 --> 50:04.789
You said Leon was actually
Lee Harvey Oswald?

50:04.915 --> 50:07.626
Yeah. I have no reason to lie to you.

50:08.043 --> 50:09.586
I'm already in jail.

50:10.128 --> 50:11.004
Go on.

50:11.213 --> 50:14.674
Finally they left
and I was alone with Dave...

50:14.883 --> 50:16.384
...and this Leon...

50:16.510 --> 50:19.095
...two of the Cubans,
and this guy Bertrand.

50:20.347 --> 50:22.474
Dave pulled out some clippings.

50:22.557 --> 50:25.769
He'd been obsessed with Castro
and Kennedy for months.

50:27.103 --> 50:30.732
Little ass-wipe closed down the camps!
Took our C-4!

50:30.857 --> 50:34.903
Took 10,000 rounds!
3,000 pounds of gunpowder!

50:34.986 --> 50:36.363
All our weapons!

50:38.031 --> 50:40.784
You want to free Cuba?
Whack out the fucking beard!

50:40.867 --> 50:43.995
Kennedy won't let us.
Our hands are empty. How can we?

50:44.204 --> 50:47.165
Problem is getting to him.
Informers on every block.

50:47.249 --> 50:49.084
They got new stuff!

50:49.209 --> 50:53.880
I could show you dozens of poisons!
Put it in his food, he'd die in three days.

50:54.130 --> 50:55.215
No trace!

50:55.298 --> 50:59.302
Put something in his beard,
make it fall out. He'd look ridiculous...

51:00.512 --> 51:05.225
Fucking Kennedy is doing all kinds of deals
with that bastard Khrushchev.

51:05.809 --> 51:07.227
Licking his ass.

51:08.603 --> 51:13.358
An inspired act of God should happen here
and put a Texan in the White House!

51:15.193 --> 51:18.280
The Cubans left. Dave was drunk.

51:19.406 --> 51:21.449
He started in on Kennedy again.

51:21.741 --> 51:24.995
I will kill! In the White House!
Stab him in the heart!

51:25.620 --> 51:27.581
Somebody must get rid of him!

51:28.957 --> 51:31.251
You won't get that son of a bitch!

51:31.418 --> 51:34.838
It won't be long.
That fucker will get what he deserves.

51:35.046 --> 51:38.341
It could be blamed on Castro,
the country will want to invade Cuba.

51:38.425 --> 51:40.802
We just need to get him in the open.

51:40.927 --> 51:44.306
Always some harebrained scheme.

51:47.642 --> 51:50.687
Let's have some more champagne,
shall we?

51:50.770 --> 51:53.315
What about the Secret Service? The cops?

51:53.773 --> 51:57.360
If it's planned right, no problem.
They got close to De Gaulle.

51:57.611 --> 51:59.613
Eisenhower always rode in open top.

51:59.696 --> 52:02.782
We need three mechanics
in three different locations.

52:03.116 --> 52:05.660
An office building, a high-powered rifle.

52:06.036 --> 52:09.706
Triangulation of crossfire, that's the key.
That's the key.

52:10.332 --> 52:13.335
A diversionary shot
gets the Secret Service looking one way.

52:13.418 --> 52:15.170
Boom! Get the kill shot.

52:16.171 --> 52:18.256
One man has to be sacrificed.

52:19.424 --> 52:21.676
In the commotion, the job gets done.

52:21.801 --> 52:23.762
The others leave the country.

52:24.304 --> 52:28.767
Let's drop this subject.
It's one thing to banter with these kids...

52:28.892 --> 52:32.729
...but this sort of thing could be
so easily misunderstood.

52:33.855 --> 52:37.108
I didn't think much about it then.
It's just bullshit.

52:37.192 --> 52:39.986
People like to act more important
than they are.

52:40.237 --> 52:42.155
Especially in the homosexual underworld.

52:43.740 --> 52:45.450
But when they got him...

52:45.909 --> 52:47.410
...I got scared.

52:47.661 --> 52:49.079
Real scared.

52:49.579 --> 52:50.956
That's when I got popped.

52:51.039 --> 52:54.292
The things you said will be attacked
by many people.

52:54.709 --> 52:59.339
Bring them on. Bring their college degrees
in here, I got nothing to hide.

52:59.464 --> 53:01.466
No one can buy me.

53:01.550 --> 53:05.011
- I don't even need this parole.
- What parole?

53:05.387 --> 53:10.058
You liberal, you don't know shit
'cause you never been fucked in the ass.

53:10.350 --> 53:14.229
This ain't about justice!
No, this is about order!

53:14.604 --> 53:16.940
Who rules? Fascism is coming back.

53:17.065 --> 53:21.027
Nobody wants to buy you.
No one's promising you parole.

53:22.946 --> 53:27.450
What I need to know
is why are you telling us this.

53:27.909 --> 53:30.203
'Cause that motherfucker Kennedy...

53:30.287 --> 53:33.123
...stole that motherfucking election,
that's why.

53:33.290 --> 53:37.085
Nixon was going to be a great President
until Kennedy wrecked this country.

53:37.169 --> 53:41.381
Niggers wanting rights!
Why do you think we have all this crime.

53:41.715 --> 53:44.384
He promised those motherfuckers
too much!

53:44.467 --> 53:47.554
Revolution's coming, bullshit!
Fascism's coming back!

53:47.762 --> 53:52.517
The day that Communist son of a bitch
died was a great day!

53:52.601 --> 53:54.603
A great day for this country.

53:54.895 --> 53:58.482
I hate to think they blame it
on silly, fucking Oswald.

53:58.982 --> 54:01.067
Didn't know shit, anyway.

54:01.318 --> 54:04.738
People got to know.
People got to know why he was killed.

54:05.489 --> 54:08.116
Because he was a Communist.

54:08.909 --> 54:13.371
You go ahead, put me on the stand,
I'll tell the same goddamned story!

54:13.622 --> 54:15.290
Don't matter to me!

54:16.833 --> 54:19.002
All right, Willie. Thanks.

54:20.045 --> 54:21.505
We'll be in touch.

54:21.630 --> 54:22.881
All right.

54:28.220 --> 54:30.680
You know, you're not a bad-looking man.

54:31.306 --> 54:32.557
Not bad at all.

54:33.141 --> 54:36.228
I get out of here, I'll come see you.
We can have fun!

54:36.770 --> 54:39.064
Their testimony won't hold up in court.

54:39.147 --> 54:42.234
Their reputations are lower
than crocodile piss.

54:42.734 --> 54:44.277
That bothers you?

54:45.904 --> 54:50.116
If a woman's a prostitute,
must she also have bad eyesight?

54:51.618 --> 54:54.496
Find Clay Bertrand.
Start by checking around the Quarter.

54:54.579 --> 54:57.457
The six of us,
with almost no budget and in secret...

54:57.541 --> 55:00.210
...will solve a case
the Warren Commission couldn't?

55:00.293 --> 55:04.130
- I didn't pick you for your legal skill.
- Thanks, Boss.

55:04.339 --> 55:08.260
You're a fighter.
I like a man who's not afraid of bad odds.

55:08.677 --> 55:11.429
Mr. Garrison, how are you?
Remember me?

55:11.721 --> 55:12.973
You vote for me?

55:13.098 --> 55:16.518
I did. We sang together
at the Royal Orleans, remember?

55:16.726 --> 55:17.894
We sang:

55:18.061 --> 55:21.106
"You're the cream in my coffee"

55:23.483 --> 55:25.443
Haven't seen you much lately.

55:25.569 --> 55:29.739
Been too busy. Elected men can't have
as much fun as they used to.

55:29.865 --> 55:33.201
It's always nice to see you.
Pleasure to serve you always.

55:35.078 --> 55:37.372
How are you? Nice to see you.

55:38.456 --> 55:40.041
Welcome back, Lou.

55:41.710 --> 55:45.130
- Think I could get a martini?
- They're waiting for you, sir.

55:46.506 --> 55:48.550
Keep that table open for us.

55:51.553 --> 55:53.346
Anything on the hoboes?

55:53.805 --> 55:57.058
Dallas Times Herald photographer
got great shots.

55:57.809 --> 55:59.352
Never published.

56:01.521 --> 56:04.065
Can't say that comes as a surprise.

56:04.941 --> 56:09.571
They took them to the sheriff's
and let them go. No record of questioning.

56:10.489 --> 56:13.658
Do they look like the hoboes
you remember?

56:14.576 --> 56:16.369
These two look young.

56:16.620 --> 56:20.832
Not a frayed collar or cuff,
fresh haircuts and shaves...

56:20.957 --> 56:24.628
- ... clean hands, new shoe leather.
- Who the hell are they then?

56:28.173 --> 56:29.341
Sit down.

56:31.885 --> 56:34.554
This could be it. Let's look for them.

56:35.305 --> 56:40.101
What about the railroad man, Lee Bowers,
who saw the men at the picket fence?

56:40.644 --> 56:43.188
Graveyard. Dead. August this year.

56:43.772 --> 56:47.400
Single-car accident on an empty road
in Midlothian, Texas.

56:47.692 --> 56:50.862
The doctor said he was in a strange shock
when he died.

56:51.404 --> 56:53.365
We need to find more witnesses.

56:53.573 --> 56:55.951
There was Rose Cheramie, a whore.

56:56.243 --> 56:59.162
She said she was a dope runner
for Jack Ruby.

56:59.704 --> 57:03.124
And that Ruby knew Oswald for years.

57:03.917 --> 57:06.670
- Can we talk to her?
- She's dead too.

57:07.254 --> 57:08.547
Hit and run.

57:13.677 --> 57:16.012
Why don't we go to the horse's mouth?

57:16.555 --> 57:21.268
Jack Ruby's been in a Dallas jail cell
for three years. Maybe he'll crack.

57:21.393 --> 57:25.522
Can't. If I go to him our investigation
will hit the front pages.

57:25.939 --> 57:29.901
It'll blow up in our face.
Susie, what did you find on Oswald?

57:30.318 --> 57:33.155
Negative on his tax records. Classified.

57:33.697 --> 57:36.366
First time a DA can't get a tax record.

57:36.992 --> 57:41.705
I asked for the CIA files on Oswald
that were part of the Warren Report.

57:43.123 --> 57:47.335
About 1,200 documents.
Can't get one of them.

57:47.502 --> 57:50.922
All classified as secret on the grounds
of national security.

57:51.339 --> 57:55.552
Gave me his grammar school records.
It's a study of his pubic hairs.

57:56.178 --> 57:57.804
Lonely kid, no father.

57:58.305 --> 58:00.307
Joins the Marines at 17.

58:00.807 --> 58:03.560
Learns Russian. Acts overtly Marxist.

58:04.436 --> 58:07.856
But he's stationed
at a top-secret air base in Japan...

58:07.981 --> 58:10.901
...where U-2 spy flights
over Russia originate.

58:11.526 --> 58:13.069
He's discharged...

58:13.278 --> 58:16.781
...supposedly because his mother's sick.
Stays home three days.

58:16.907 --> 58:21.745
Then, with a $1,500 ticket from
a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow.

58:22.204 --> 58:23.914
Mr. Oswald, do you understand...

58:24.039 --> 58:27.125
- ... the action you are about to take?
- Yes, I do, sir.

58:30.462 --> 58:32.714
I wish to renounce my citizenship...

58:33.465 --> 58:35.926
...and become a Soviet citizen.

58:36.885 --> 58:40.597
I'll give them all the information
I have on the Marines.

58:41.181 --> 58:44.226
He disappears for six weeks,
presumably with the KGB.

58:45.018 --> 58:47.687
He's taken to a radio factory in Minsk...

58:47.771 --> 58:51.066
...where he lives as high on the hog
as he ever has.

58:51.274 --> 58:54.986
He's given 5,000 rubles,
a roomy apartment with a balcony.

58:56.363 --> 58:58.281
Has affairs with local girls.

58:58.448 --> 59:00.450
Makes sense. He's a spokesman.

59:01.785 --> 59:05.372
But he never does any propaganda
for the Russians.

59:06.540 --> 59:08.041
He meets Marina.

59:08.500 --> 59:11.628
Her uncle is a colonel
in Soviet intelligence.

59:13.380 --> 59:15.674
She thinks he's Russian by his speech.

59:15.757 --> 59:18.718
Six weeks later they marry,
have a daughter.

59:19.052 --> 59:23.223
Only explanation for the royal treatment
is he gave them radar secrets.

59:23.390 --> 59:24.850
Or fake secrets.

59:24.933 --> 59:27.060
Six months after he's in Russia...

59:27.144 --> 59:30.605
...Francis Gary Powers' U-2 spy flight
goes down...

59:30.856 --> 59:33.441
...in Russia. That plane was untouchable.

59:33.733 --> 59:35.360
Powers hinted that Oswald...

59:35.443 --> 59:38.446
...could've given the Russians
enough data to hit it.

59:38.530 --> 59:43.076
As a result, the peace summit between
Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.

59:43.160 --> 59:47.372
Perhaps our military didn't want
the conference to happen?

59:48.665 --> 59:51.001
Maybe Oswald was part of that!

59:51.126 --> 59:55.630
- Stick to what you can prove in court.
- You want facts?

59:56.256 --> 59:59.843
Don't get sidetracked.
How'd he get back to the States?

1:00:00.802 --> 1:00:03.263
Does he have any problems
with Uncle Sam?

1:00:03.346 --> 1:00:07.100
No. The State Department issues him
a new passport in 48 hours...

1:00:07.184 --> 1:00:09.186
...and loans him travel money.

1:00:09.811 --> 1:00:14.858
He's never investigated or charged
for revealing classified information...

1:00:15.150 --> 1:00:17.861
...or, as far as we know,
debriefed by the CIA.

1:00:17.944 --> 1:00:21.990
Bastard should've been prosecuted
as a traitor when he got off the boat.

1:00:23.241 --> 1:00:25.160
Did Marina have problems getting out?

1:00:25.243 --> 1:00:29.581
None, though it's almost impossible
to get Russian sweethearts out.

1:00:30.499 --> 1:00:35.086
This is a man who defected once already.
It's crazy. Ordinary people...

1:00:35.337 --> 1:00:38.673
...get blacklisted
for having leftist affiliations.

1:00:38.757 --> 1:00:40.008
Doesn't add up.

1:00:40.091 --> 1:00:43.512
Next thing, he's living in
Dallas-Fort Worth, October '62...

1:00:43.887 --> 1:00:46.890
...working six months
at Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall...

1:00:47.015 --> 1:00:50.477
...a photographic firm that makes maps
for the US Army.

1:00:51.728 --> 1:00:55.148
Oswald becomes chummy
with the Dallas White Russian community.

1:00:55.232 --> 1:00:56.983
All rabid anti-Communists.

1:00:57.526 --> 1:00:58.485
It's odd.

1:00:58.568 --> 1:01:03.990
His closest friend is an oilman,
named George DeMohrenschildt.

1:01:04.074 --> 1:01:09.538
He is 35 years older than Oswald,
who is only 23 and supposedly broke.

1:01:11.540 --> 1:01:15.335
He is a part of the Dallas Petroleum Club,
speaks five languages...

1:01:15.460 --> 1:01:18.380
...and was a French Vichy intelligence
during the war...

1:01:18.463 --> 1:01:21.758
...also rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer.

1:01:24.261 --> 1:01:27.848
DeMohrenschildt draws a picture
of Oswald as an intellectual...

1:01:27.931 --> 1:01:32.185
...well read, speaks excellent Russian,
a man who adored JFK.

1:01:35.897 --> 1:01:38.942
I think he's made some mistakes
regarding Cuba.

1:01:39.651 --> 1:01:43.864
I think he's doing a pretty good job.
If he succeeds, in my opinion...

1:01:43.947 --> 1:01:47.325
...I think he'd make a great President
and a handsome one, too.

1:01:47.576 --> 1:01:50.245
That's scenery, Susie.
Now, don't get sidetracked.

1:01:50.328 --> 1:01:54.166
This is the same man that nailed Oswald
to the Warren Commission...

1:01:54.249 --> 1:01:57.294
...as a potentially violent man
and linked him to the rifle.

1:01:57.544 --> 1:02:00.922
Well, in that sense
Castro is an experimenter.

1:02:02.924 --> 1:02:05.260
It could go any way with that country.

1:02:05.427 --> 1:02:08.805
- It could go the way of the communism-
- What you got there?

1:02:10.056 --> 1:02:12.017
Do you have rifles in there?

1:02:14.019 --> 1:02:18.857
Tell me what I'm shooting at,
rabbits or Fascists?

1:02:20.192 --> 1:02:22.444
- I hunt.
- You hunt?

1:02:23.195 --> 1:02:26.031
We don't know he's CIA.
Let's circle him very probable.

1:02:26.114 --> 1:02:27.866
Call him Oswald's handler.

1:02:28.283 --> 1:02:32.662
The Oswalds are introduced
to Janet and Bill Williams.

1:02:34.831 --> 1:02:39.377
It's through Janet Williams,
in October '63, that Lee gets the job...

1:02:39.628 --> 1:02:42.923
...at the warehouse on Elm Street
at the Book Depository.

1:02:43.882 --> 1:02:48.637
So he can now exercise his intellect,
stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.

1:02:50.430 --> 1:02:53.767
Marina fights with Lee about many things.

1:02:56.144 --> 1:02:58.480
His secrecy, their lack of money.

1:02:59.397 --> 1:03:02.400
She says that Lee is not sexually adequate.

1:03:05.153 --> 1:03:07.322
Lee hits her on several occasions.

1:03:08.365 --> 1:03:09.825
At the age of 24...

1:03:09.908 --> 1:03:13.328
...he rents a room in Dallas
under the alias of O.H. Lee.

1:03:13.703 --> 1:03:16.665
Do you want to watch TV?
Are you all right?

1:03:17.666 --> 1:03:19.417
No, thank you. I'm fine.

1:03:20.544 --> 1:03:24.422
All I know about the Williams is
their tax returns are classified.

1:03:24.589 --> 1:03:28.093
Bill Williams has links to the CIA
through his family...

1:03:28.343 --> 1:03:31.012
...and does classified work
for Bell Helicopter.

1:03:31.221 --> 1:03:35.642
Bill's convenient separation from Janet
allows Marina to move into her house...

1:03:35.851 --> 1:03:38.770
...where she suddenly becomes
Marina's best friend.

1:03:38.854 --> 1:03:41.857
There Marina and Lee
have a second daughter.

1:03:43.108 --> 1:03:45.735
I have to go away. Just for a short while.

1:03:46.736 --> 1:03:48.738
What's wrong with this family?

1:03:48.989 --> 1:03:50.240
I love Lee...

1:03:50.615 --> 1:03:52.742
...and I sorry him.

1:03:53.326 --> 1:03:54.536
Sorry for him?

1:03:55.453 --> 1:03:56.246
Yes.

1:03:56.329 --> 1:03:59.291
When he's arrested,
Marina buries him with the public.

1:03:59.374 --> 1:04:02.669
She describes him as a psychotic
and violent man.

1:04:03.170 --> 1:04:04.796
I have too much facts...

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:08.842
...and facts tell me that Lee shot Kennedy.

1:04:09.217 --> 1:04:12.554
After being locked away
by the feds for two months...

1:04:12.679 --> 1:04:14.806
...and afraid she'd be deported...

1:04:15.140 --> 1:04:18.268
...she was probably suffering
from nervous exhaustion.

1:04:18.685 --> 1:04:20.687
They taught her how to answer.

1:04:20.812 --> 1:04:23.815
When they think she's ready,
they buy her dresses...

1:04:23.899 --> 1:04:26.359
...polish her appearance and wheel her out.

1:04:26.443 --> 1:04:30.071
- I'd like to thank the Warren Commission.
- Oswald was no angel.

1:04:31.448 --> 1:04:32.824
But who was he?

1:04:33.116 --> 1:04:35.452
I'm lost. What are we saying?

1:04:36.578 --> 1:04:40.165
That when Oswald went to Russia,
he was not a real defector.

1:04:41.082 --> 1:04:45.754
He was an intelligence agent for our
government and remained one till he died.

1:04:47.005 --> 1:04:49.508
So, because Oswald pulled the trigger...

1:04:49.966 --> 1:04:53.053
...the intelligence community
murdered the President?

1:04:54.346 --> 1:04:56.681
I'll go you one better. Maybe Oswald...

1:04:56.765 --> 1:04:58.558
...didn't pull the trigger.

1:04:58.642 --> 1:05:02.312
Nitrate tests indicate he hadn't fired
a rifle on November 22.

1:05:02.395 --> 1:05:06.066
And they didn't bother to see
if the rifle'd been fired that day.

1:05:06.775 --> 1:05:10.070
- His palm print was on it.
- It went to the FBl.

1:05:10.737 --> 1:05:12.823
FBI didn't find a goddamn thing.

1:05:13.198 --> 1:05:17.828
It comes back a week later and a Dallas
policeman suddenly finds a palm print?

1:05:18.495 --> 1:05:22.541
It could've been taken at the morgue.
There's no chain of evidence.

1:05:22.624 --> 1:05:27.087
I can't figure out why he orders
a traceable weapon...

1:05:27.170 --> 1:05:30.632
...to a P.O. box, when he can go
into any store in Texas...

1:05:31.341 --> 1:05:34.803
...give a phony name and walk out
with an untraceable rifle.

1:05:34.970 --> 1:05:36.304
To frame him, obviously!

1:05:36.388 --> 1:05:38.598
A lot of smoke, but some fire.

1:05:38.765 --> 1:05:40.767
We're talking about our government!

1:05:40.851 --> 1:05:43.103
We're talking about a crime.

1:05:43.854 --> 1:05:47.023
You must think on a different level,
like the CIA does.

1:05:47.649 --> 1:05:49.818
We're through the looking glass.

1:05:50.819 --> 1:05:52.112
White is black.

1:05:53.029 --> 1:05:54.531
And black is white.

1:05:55.574 --> 1:05:58.201
Maybe Oswald is just what he said he was.

1:05:59.035 --> 1:06:00.120
A patsy.

1:06:06.126 --> 1:06:08.253
Unbelievable. You were here?

1:06:08.378 --> 1:06:10.630
Yes, this is where I was sitting.

1:06:11.173 --> 1:06:14.593
Shots came from near the wooden fence
over there...

1:06:16.011 --> 1:06:17.596
...near the overpass.

1:06:17.929 --> 1:06:21.725
I saw a man run from the fence
toward those railroad cars.

1:06:22.350 --> 1:06:24.519
I made it clear to the Warren people.

1:06:24.603 --> 1:06:27.647
One of the shots came
from behind that picket fence.

1:06:28.231 --> 1:06:32.402
I heard the report and saw smoke,
six or eight feet above the ground.

1:06:32.694 --> 1:06:34.529
Out from under those trees.

1:06:34.696 --> 1:06:38.033
All four of us railroad men...

1:06:38.116 --> 1:06:39.826
...seen the same thing.

1:06:40.452 --> 1:06:42.496
The smoke came from behind the hedge.

1:06:42.579 --> 1:06:46.791
I was standing next to Mary Moorman,
who took the photo when he was killed.

1:06:49.586 --> 1:06:51.963
I stepped down to the curb and yelled:

1:06:52.255 --> 1:06:54.674
"Mr. President, look over here! "

1:06:56.718 --> 1:06:58.261
Then shots rang out.

1:07:00.388 --> 1:07:05.477
Mary dropped to the ground, yelling,
"They're shooting! Get down! "

1:07:06.686 --> 1:07:08.605
I just stood there watching.

1:07:09.439 --> 1:07:11.149
The driver had stopped.

1:07:12.067 --> 1:07:13.985
I don't know what was wrong with him.

1:07:16.613 --> 1:07:18.615
Out of the corner of my eye...

1:07:19.449 --> 1:07:21.535
...I saw a flash of light in the bushes.

1:07:22.244 --> 1:07:23.787
And that last shot...

1:07:25.080 --> 1:07:26.665
...just ripped his head off.

1:07:27.999 --> 1:07:31.962
I looked up and saw smoke coming
from over there, on the knoll.

1:07:32.087 --> 1:07:34.464
We came around to look for tracks.

1:07:35.131 --> 1:07:38.134
It rained that morning
and we found a bunch.

1:07:38.844 --> 1:07:40.053
Cigarette butts.

1:07:40.136 --> 1:07:42.556
Someone had stood about... here.

1:07:48.937 --> 1:07:50.438
That's a good spot.

1:07:51.648 --> 1:07:52.691
For the head shot.

1:07:54.568 --> 1:07:56.444
Everything was just frozen.

1:07:57.404 --> 1:08:01.533
Like people weren't breathing.
Like you were looking at a picture.

1:08:04.619 --> 1:08:06.121
Except for one man.

1:08:07.122 --> 1:08:11.459
I saw this one man running
from the corner of the Book Depository...

1:08:11.543 --> 1:08:12.961
...to the parking lot.

1:08:13.170 --> 1:08:15.005
It was about 11:00 a. m.

1:08:15.422 --> 1:08:19.050
I was driving on Elm Street
toward the underpass in a rented car.

1:08:19.634 --> 1:08:21.178
A light-blue Valiant.

1:08:21.887 --> 1:08:25.223
I'll never forget that day.
There was a lot of traffic...

1:08:25.307 --> 1:08:28.143
...and I stopped
alongside a green pickup truck.

1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:32.647
It was very noticeable
because it had one wheel up on the curb.

1:08:33.064 --> 1:08:34.900
When I saw the gun, I thought...

1:08:37.277 --> 1:08:39.613
..."The Secret Service is not very secret. "

1:08:39.696 --> 1:08:42.491
The next morning, I went to the FBI office.

1:08:42.574 --> 1:08:44.701
They showed me some pictures.

1:08:44.910 --> 1:08:48.747
And I picked out three pictures
that looked like the truck's driver.

1:08:49.748 --> 1:08:51.082
That's the man.

1:08:51.291 --> 1:08:53.793
You mean you identified Jack Ruby
on Saturday?

1:08:54.044 --> 1:08:55.003
That's right.

1:08:55.086 --> 1:08:56.755
The day before he shot Oswald?

1:08:57.005 --> 1:09:00.425
That's right. When I saw him on TV,
I was shocked.

1:09:00.717 --> 1:09:04.095
I said to my family,
"That's the man I saw in the truck. "

1:09:05.597 --> 1:09:08.350
You weren't so sure in your statement
to the Commission.

1:09:08.850 --> 1:09:11.853
What about these others?
You said one might be him?

1:09:13.021 --> 1:09:16.191
They look a bit like him,
but I'm sure this is the man.

1:09:16.441 --> 1:09:18.944
It was him I chased up the grassy knoll.

1:09:20.695 --> 1:09:24.032
I thought maybe our guys had shot back
and got one of them.

1:09:25.116 --> 1:09:26.868
I got to the parking lot.

1:09:27.661 --> 1:09:30.872
All I saw were the railroad workers
and Dallas' finest.

1:09:32.582 --> 1:09:36.837
- Secret Service. Come with us.
- No! Find the shooter!

1:09:37.420 --> 1:09:38.922
I want your pictures.

1:09:39.005 --> 1:09:40.215
Son of a bitch!

1:09:40.298 --> 1:09:42.300
He put a hurt on me, but good.

1:09:42.676 --> 1:09:47.900
They must've seen everything because
they knew what we had done all day.

1:09:48.232 --> 1:09:51.235
I wasn't hard to find,
wearing that red raincoat.

1:09:51.319 --> 1:09:54.280
- How many shots did you hear?
- Four to six.

1:09:55.448 --> 1:09:56.616
Impossible!

1:09:57.700 --> 1:09:59.243
You heard echoes!

1:10:01.579 --> 1:10:05.208
We have three bullets and three shots
that came from the Book Depository.

1:10:05.291 --> 1:10:07.669
- That's all we'll say.
- No, sir.

1:10:08.211 --> 1:10:13.091
I saw a man shooting from behind
that fence. What are you going to do?

1:10:13.508 --> 1:10:16.594
- You go out there and get him!
- That's taken care of!

1:10:16.761 --> 1:10:20.306
You only heard three shots,
and don't discuss this with anyone.

1:10:21.099 --> 1:10:22.433
No one. Understand?

1:10:22.642 --> 1:10:26.312
Which is strange 'cause it's less
than 20 minutes after the assassination.

1:10:26.396 --> 1:10:27.814
Get her out of here.

1:10:27.897 --> 1:10:30.358
I knew something was crooked
as a dog's hind leg.

1:10:31.734 --> 1:10:34.988
When I read my testimony
in the Warren Report...

1:10:35.405 --> 1:10:37.615
...it was a total fabrication.

1:10:37.907 --> 1:10:41.953
That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.
They've altered my statements.

1:10:43.079 --> 1:10:44.622
This one says:

1:10:44.914 --> 1:10:49.502
"Mercer couldn't identify any photograph
as being the man she observed...

1:10:49.585 --> 1:10:52.880
"... slouched over the wheel
of the green truck. " Not true.

1:10:52.964 --> 1:10:55.591
I recognized him and I told them so.

1:10:56.592 --> 1:10:57.927
Take your time.

1:10:58.094 --> 1:10:58.928
I'm sure.

1:10:59.012 --> 1:11:00.930
And the sheriff's report...

1:11:01.347 --> 1:11:02.849
This is really strange.

1:11:03.182 --> 1:11:05.310
See that notarized signature?

1:11:06.477 --> 1:11:07.937
That's not mine.

1:11:08.104 --> 1:11:11.190
There wasn't any notary present
during my questioning.

1:11:13.359 --> 1:11:15.570
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man...

1:11:17.655 --> 1:11:19.824
...it's difficult to accept this.

1:11:20.408 --> 1:11:23.411
Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison
about the Carousel Club.

1:11:29.709 --> 1:11:33.671
I used to go there to see Jack
and my friend, Jatta, who danced there.

1:11:34.422 --> 1:11:36.799
It was a real swinging spot in town.

1:11:36.883 --> 1:11:38.176
Everybody came.

1:11:38.635 --> 1:11:42.013
Businessmen, politicians from Austin,
LBJ's friends-

1:11:42.513 --> 1:11:44.682
Dallas was a slowpokin' town then.

1:11:44.849 --> 1:11:48.478
You chewed toothpicks, played dominoes,
spit, dated policemen.

1:11:48.853 --> 1:11:52.273
But Jack was exciting.
There were always cops there.

1:11:52.357 --> 1:11:56.194
Jack liked them around, even though
he threw out the drunks himself.

1:11:56.861 --> 1:11:58.571
He had a violent temper.

1:11:59.822 --> 1:12:02.784
Everyone in those days
knew Jack was in the mob.

1:12:03.868 --> 1:12:06.454
Cops back then, they were bad.

1:12:06.955 --> 1:12:09.958
They'd shake you down
for the money in your pocket.

1:12:12.168 --> 1:12:13.503
What about Lee?

1:12:14.879 --> 1:12:16.214
One time I came in.

1:12:16.297 --> 1:12:20.718
Jack introduced me to two guys.
He says, "This is my friend, Lee... "

1:12:23.054 --> 1:12:25.390
I don't remember the other guy's name.

1:12:25.473 --> 1:12:29.394
He was a weird-looking guy.
He had these eyebrows.

1:12:29.936 --> 1:12:31.896
And he looked like a buzzard.

1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:36.818
Lee didn't make much of an impression.

1:12:37.944 --> 1:12:39.988
He wasn't very handsome.

1:12:40.196 --> 1:12:43.741
He didn't look like he had any money,
and he was in a bad mood.

1:12:43.992 --> 1:12:46.035
So, I didn't pay him much mind.

1:12:47.954 --> 1:12:51.165
I may not remember a name,
but I always remember a face.

1:12:52.917 --> 1:12:55.295
Later, when I saw him on television...

1:12:56.713 --> 1:12:58.965
...I screamed, "My God, that's him!

1:12:59.590 --> 1:13:01.301
"That's Jack's friend! "

1:13:02.927 --> 1:13:04.721
Will you testify, Beverly?

1:13:06.931 --> 1:13:10.101
- I don't think so.
- I thought we had an agreement.

1:13:13.896 --> 1:13:17.984
- I don't want to be another statistic.
- We could call you in.

1:13:18.443 --> 1:13:22.030
If they can kill the President
of the United States...

1:13:23.573 --> 1:13:27.327
...you think they'll think twice
about a two-bit showgirl like me?

1:13:33.416 --> 1:13:35.835
I understand the pressure you're under.

1:13:36.628 --> 1:13:38.379
Don't think that I don't.

1:13:39.589 --> 1:13:41.007
We both do.

1:13:46.971 --> 1:13:52.268
Mr. Chief Justice, do you understand
that I can't tell the truth in Dallas?

1:13:53.561 --> 1:13:56.940
There are people here who do not want me
to tell the truth.

1:13:57.106 --> 1:13:59.359
Who don't want me to have a retrial.

1:13:59.901 --> 1:14:01.986
Why don't you just tell us now?

1:14:02.528 --> 1:14:04.197
My life is in danger!

1:14:04.489 --> 1:14:07.075
If you request that I go to Washington...

1:14:07.158 --> 1:14:10.328
That is, if you want to hear
further testimony from me.

1:14:10.578 --> 1:14:12.121
Can you take me with you?

1:14:12.205 --> 1:14:14.040
No. It can't be done.

1:14:14.582 --> 1:14:16.668
There would be no safe place for you.

1:14:16.751 --> 1:14:19.337
We're not law-enforcement officers.

1:14:20.254 --> 1:14:23.383
There's a great deal
at stake in this matter.

1:14:24.592 --> 1:14:26.427
If I'm eliminated...

1:14:26.761 --> 1:14:31.265
...there won't be any way of knowing
any bit of truth pertaining to my situation.

1:14:32.934 --> 1:14:36.854
Consequently, a whole new form
of government will take over.

1:14:38.898 --> 1:14:41.901
And I won't live to see you
some other time.

1:14:42.527 --> 1:14:44.279
I want to tell the truth.

1:14:44.362 --> 1:14:45.530
And then...

1:14:45.697 --> 1:14:47.365
...leave this world.

1:14:49.617 --> 1:14:53.121
The Zapruder film establishes
three shots in 5.6 seconds.

1:14:56.582 --> 1:14:57.917
I'm Oswald.

1:14:59.002 --> 1:15:00.295
Time me.

1:15:01.379 --> 1:15:02.463
Go.

1:15:07.927 --> 1:15:08.720
Time?

1:15:08.928 --> 1:15:10.596
Between six and seven seconds.

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:12.098
Without really aiming.

1:15:12.181 --> 1:15:15.935
The second and third shots came
almost right on top of each other.

1:15:16.644 --> 1:15:18.771
It takes a minimum of...

1:15:18.896 --> 1:15:21.399
...2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.

1:15:21.899 --> 1:15:24.360
The other problem is, there was a tree...

1:15:24.444 --> 1:15:28.573
...blocking the first two shots
when fired in the Zapruder film.

1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:32.910
Didn't Hoover say something
about leaves falling in November?

1:15:33.411 --> 1:15:35.496
It was Texas live oak, Chief.

1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:38.458
It sheds its leaves in early March.

1:15:39.042 --> 1:15:42.462
Take this Carcano,
world's worst shoulder weapon...

1:15:42.670 --> 1:15:47.133
...and try to hit a moving target
at 88 yards through heavy foliage.

1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:48.926
No way.

1:15:51.971 --> 1:15:54.223
FBI tried two sets of tests.

1:15:54.349 --> 1:15:57.518
Not one sharpshooter could match
Oswald's performance.

1:15:57.894 --> 1:15:59.187
Not one.

1:15:59.312 --> 1:16:01.814
Oswald was at best a medium shot.

1:16:02.357 --> 1:16:04.525
The scope was defective on it too.

1:16:05.026 --> 1:16:07.695
This is the whole essence
of the case to me.

1:16:08.196 --> 1:16:10.698
The guy couldn't do the shooting.

1:16:11.157 --> 1:16:12.492
Nobody could.

1:16:12.825 --> 1:16:15.453
They sold this lemon
to the American public.

1:16:17.288 --> 1:16:20.375
The Zapruder film was the proof
they didn't count on.

1:16:21.292 --> 1:16:23.002
We must get hold of it.

1:16:24.379 --> 1:16:27.340
It means we'll have to subpoena Time-Life.

1:16:28.716 --> 1:16:30.468
Let me ask you something.

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:33.137
Why not just shoot Kennedy on Houston?

1:16:33.513 --> 1:16:35.098
Plenty of time.

1:16:36.432 --> 1:16:39.435
- He's out in the open.
- I keep asking myself the same thing.

1:16:39.519 --> 1:16:41.938
- Frontal shot.
- Even if you miss him once...

1:16:42.146 --> 1:16:44.399
...if he accelerates, you get a second shot.

1:16:44.482 --> 1:16:46.526
The only reason to get him on Elm...

1:16:47.193 --> 1:16:50.154
...is you got him in a
triangulated crossfire.

1:16:51.114 --> 1:16:53.825
You put a team there down at the fence.

1:16:54.033 --> 1:16:56.661
Frontal shot. Flat, low trajectory.

1:16:57.245 --> 1:17:00.665
Put a third team down in this building...

1:17:00.748 --> 1:17:02.041
...on a low floor.

1:17:02.125 --> 1:17:05.336
When Kennedy gets in the kill zone,
it's a turkey shoot.

1:17:08.214 --> 1:17:09.590
How many men?

1:17:11.259 --> 1:17:15.138
One shooter. One spotter on a radio.
Maybe three teams.

1:17:17.598 --> 1:17:20.852
These are professional riflemen.
Serious people.

1:17:22.061 --> 1:17:23.229
Hunters.

1:17:25.064 --> 1:17:26.357
Patient.

1:17:28.318 --> 1:17:30.570
It takes skill to kill with a rifle.

1:17:33.698 --> 1:17:38.369
That's why no chief executive's
been executed with one in 200 years.

1:17:42.040 --> 1:17:43.082
Three...

1:17:44.042 --> 1:17:45.126
...two...

1:17:46.628 --> 1:17:47.629
...one.

1:17:57.430 --> 1:17:59.432
Main Street's over there.

1:18:00.266 --> 1:18:02.977
Original parade route on the way
to the Trade Mart...

1:18:03.811 --> 1:18:05.188
...is too far, right?

1:18:05.271 --> 1:18:06.397
Too far.

1:18:06.481 --> 1:18:10.443
Impossible shot,
so they change the parade route.

1:18:10.693 --> 1:18:13.696
Bring him down here.
Moving at a normal 25 mph.

1:18:13.780 --> 1:18:17.075
They knew the motorcade would have
to slow down to about 10 mph...

1:18:17.158 --> 1:18:20.286
...to make that turn there.
And that's where they got him.

1:18:27.752 --> 1:18:30.296
Who do you think changed
the parade route?

1:18:30.380 --> 1:18:33.383
Beats me. Secret Service,
city officials, Dallas Police.

1:18:34.217 --> 1:18:36.219
You know who was the mayor at the time?

1:18:36.302 --> 1:18:37.470
Roy Cabell.

1:18:37.845 --> 1:18:39.973
- Guess who his brother is?
- Who?

1:18:40.848 --> 1:18:42.558
General Charles Cabell.

1:18:43.101 --> 1:18:44.894
Deputy director of the CIA.

1:18:44.978 --> 1:18:48.147
Kennedy fired him in '61
because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.

1:18:49.399 --> 1:18:52.443
Moved back to the Pentagon
and called Kennedy a traitor.

1:18:52.735 --> 1:18:54.529
When he came to New Orleans...

1:18:54.612 --> 1:18:58.658
...to address the Foreign Policy
Association, know who introduced him?

1:18:59.367 --> 1:19:00.952
Our friend, Clay Shaw.

1:19:01.035 --> 1:19:02.829
Didn't the Warren Commission call him?

1:19:02.912 --> 1:19:05.248
His boss was the one
on the Warren Commission...

1:19:05.331 --> 1:19:07.583
...who handled the leads
in the intelligence community.

1:19:07.667 --> 1:19:10.545
- Allen Dulles?
- Head of the CIA since '53.

1:19:11.713 --> 1:19:13.548
Kennedy fired them both.

1:19:14.674 --> 1:19:17.260
Cabell was his Deputy for nine years.

1:19:18.594 --> 1:19:21.514
Talk about the fox investigating
the chicken coop.

1:19:23.057 --> 1:19:25.685
Now, we'll have to subpoena them both.

1:19:37.989 --> 1:19:40.491
Clay Bertrand? Sure, I know him.

1:19:40.658 --> 1:19:42.201
Comes to the Quarter.

1:19:42.368 --> 1:19:46.289
Who is he? I've been to all the bars.
Nobody wants to talk.

1:19:47.665 --> 1:19:49.584
Why should they talk to you?

1:19:50.793 --> 1:19:54.589
I told your uncle, I never met a lawman
who wasn't a punk.

1:19:58.676 --> 1:20:01.763
A big-shot businessman.
I seen him on the TV news...

1:20:01.846 --> 1:20:03.931
...with all the other big shots.

1:20:04.390 --> 1:20:06.351
The guy's a fag, you know?

1:20:06.809 --> 1:20:08.394
Goes by another name.

1:20:08.686 --> 1:20:10.063
What name?

1:20:10.897 --> 1:20:11.898
Shaw.

1:20:12.023 --> 1:20:13.399
Clay Shaw.

1:20:13.733 --> 1:20:15.568
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?

1:20:16.361 --> 1:20:18.905
Guy who ran the International Trade Mart?

1:20:19.405 --> 1:20:22.742
What's the mystery?
Everybody down here knows him.

1:20:23.910 --> 1:20:26.371
Then why does he call himself Bertrand?

1:20:26.454 --> 1:20:29.123
Who gives a shit what he calls himself?

1:20:29.499 --> 1:20:33.169
Will you give us a little help
on that grand jury thing?

1:20:34.087 --> 1:20:35.755
I hope so. We could use it.

1:20:36.172 --> 1:20:38.007
Your hunch was right, Boss.

1:20:38.174 --> 1:20:40.176
But it's even spookier than we thought.

1:20:40.259 --> 1:20:44.973
Starting in September '63 on,
two months before the assassination...

1:20:45.223 --> 1:20:48.393
...there are sightings of Oswald
all over Dallas.

1:20:48.476 --> 1:20:53.106
Buying ammunition,
getting a telescopic sight fixed.

1:20:53.815 --> 1:20:55.066
Going to rifle ranges.

1:20:55.149 --> 1:20:59.237
Early November,
at a downtown Dallas Lincoln dealership...

1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:02.824
- ... he tells the salesman:
- Let's take it over for a test drive.

1:21:02.907 --> 1:21:06.911
Despite the fact he has no license,
and doesn't know how to drive...

1:21:07.203 --> 1:21:10.456
...he hits the curves like A.J. Foyt
at the Indy 500.

1:21:10.623 --> 1:21:13.876
Beauregard later told his boss
that he drove like a madman.

1:21:14.043 --> 1:21:17.797
$300 down now, Mr. Oswald,
you can drive out of here.

1:21:17.922 --> 1:21:19.966
What? For this heap?

1:21:20.967 --> 1:21:25.013
No honest working man can afford to buy
a car in this goddamn country anymore.

1:21:25.096 --> 1:21:27.307
Maybe I'll go to Russia and buy one.

1:21:27.473 --> 1:21:31.311
Really dumb dialogue like he's trying
to draw attention to himself.

1:21:32.770 --> 1:21:38.401
Salesman remembers him as about 5'7",
but his draft card says he's actually 5'11".

1:21:38.943 --> 1:21:42.780
Other witnesses see him on several
separate days at different firing ranges.

1:21:43.281 --> 1:21:45.241
One time, November 9...

1:21:45.408 --> 1:21:48.828
...he decides to practice
on the next guy's target.

1:21:48.911 --> 1:21:52.832
I didn't pay for a target
just to have you shoot at it!

1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.210
I'm sorry, buddy.

1:21:57.128 --> 1:22:00.548
I thought I was shooting
at that son of a bitch Kennedy.

1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:03.926
As subtle as a cockroach
crawling across a white rug.

1:22:04.093 --> 1:22:06.554
Then he shows up at Sylvia Odio's...

1:22:06.929 --> 1:22:10.516
...a Cuban lady in Dallas
in the anti-Castro underground.

1:22:10.683 --> 1:22:13.686
The two Cubans introduce him
as Leon Oswald.

1:22:16.147 --> 1:22:18.191
Something about the man bothers her.

1:22:18.274 --> 1:22:21.110
48 hours later, one of the Cubans calls her.

1:22:21.778 --> 1:22:23.988
What did you think of me
and Oswald last night?

1:22:24.113 --> 1:22:25.573
I don't care about Oswald.

1:22:25.657 --> 1:22:29.160
You know what he said to us?
"Cubans don't have guts, 'cause Kennedy...

1:22:29.243 --> 1:22:32.413
"... should have been killed
after the Bay of Pigs by a Cuban. "

1:22:32.538 --> 1:22:36.042
It's like he's giving her information
she doesn't even ask for.

1:22:36.167 --> 1:22:38.378
She's scared and doesn't see him again...

1:22:38.628 --> 1:22:41.464
...till she sees Oswald's picture
in the paper.

1:22:41.756 --> 1:22:43.967
But the Warren Commission
says that Sylvia...

1:22:44.092 --> 1:22:47.804
...has bad eyesight because
they have Oswald in Mexico...

1:22:48.262 --> 1:22:50.640
...trying to get back into Cuba.

1:22:51.140 --> 1:22:54.310
The CIA has a camera
outside the Cuban Embassy.

1:22:54.560 --> 1:22:56.271
And they say that this...

1:22:57.313 --> 1:22:59.274
...is Oswald in Mexico.

1:23:00.900 --> 1:23:03.903
If this is Oswald,
it must be our third Oswald.

1:23:04.487 --> 1:23:08.616
The Warren Commission made great efforts
to make him a Communist.

1:23:08.992 --> 1:23:13.746
I think the point of the Mexican episode
was to lay the blame on Fidel Castro.

1:23:15.290 --> 1:23:17.709
If Oswald, or someone purporting
to be Oswald...

1:23:17.834 --> 1:23:21.629
...had gotten into Cuba, come back,
and then killed the President...

1:23:22.797 --> 1:23:25.800
...the American public would've supported
a Cuban invasion.

1:23:25.925 --> 1:23:28.845
I even have doubts about this photo, Boss.

1:23:29.429 --> 1:23:32.432
This convicted Oswald in the public's mind.

1:23:32.682 --> 1:23:36.227
But Oswald told Capt. Fritz
that the photo was a fake.

1:23:36.477 --> 1:23:37.854
This is not me!

1:23:38.187 --> 1:23:41.774
- That came from Janet Williams' garage.
- I never saw this picture.

1:23:41.899 --> 1:23:46.613
It's my face but it's superimposed.
The rest is not me.

1:23:46.738 --> 1:23:49.907
I know photographic work.
That picture was made by someone else!

1:23:50.450 --> 1:23:52.577
I took this picture to two experts.

1:23:53.286 --> 1:23:55.663
Look at how the shadows on the nose...

1:23:55.997 --> 1:23:58.416
...fall in a straight line,
like it's high noon.

1:23:58.541 --> 1:24:02.170
But the shadow on the ground is more
like late afternoon or early morning.

1:24:02.295 --> 1:24:03.755
It's not the same time.

1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:06.215
And see the crop marks across the chin?

1:24:06.424 --> 1:24:09.135
This head is pasted onto another body.

1:24:09.510 --> 1:24:12.013
Implicating him with the rifle and the gun.

1:24:12.138 --> 1:24:15.308
Who the hell are you?
Alex Hidell or Lee Oswald?

1:24:19.020 --> 1:24:20.939
You're the policeman, you work it out.

1:24:21.064 --> 1:24:23.733
Now it gets positively spooky.

1:24:24.025 --> 1:24:28.571
In January 1961, in New Orleans,
at the Bolton Ford dealership...

1:24:29.197 --> 1:24:31.741
...when the Oswald we know is in Russia...

1:24:32.450 --> 1:24:35.787
...there is a man using the name of Oswald
to buy trucks...

1:24:35.954 --> 1:24:37.872
...for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.

1:24:37.956 --> 1:24:39.874
Salesman never sees him again.

1:24:39.958 --> 1:24:44.462
But who's on the Articles Of Incorporation
of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?

1:24:45.463 --> 1:24:46.714
Guy Banister.

1:24:47.465 --> 1:24:51.135
Banister has someone using
the name Oswald to buy the trucks.

1:24:52.053 --> 1:24:55.598
Hoover at the FBI has a memo
dated June of 1960...

1:24:56.307 --> 1:24:59.936
...that someone may be using
Oswald's passport and identity.

1:25:00.186 --> 1:25:02.730
They created Oswald from day one.

1:25:03.064 --> 1:25:06.985
Like a dummy corporation in the Bahamas.
Just move him around a board.

1:25:07.527 --> 1:25:09.195
Anybody want to quit?

1:25:11.698 --> 1:25:14.242
Dumb question. Put your hands down.

1:25:15.952 --> 1:25:17.662
I found Clay Bertrand.

1:25:18.788 --> 1:25:20.915
Grab your socks and hose and pull.

1:25:21.374 --> 1:25:23.209
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw.

1:25:24.168 --> 1:25:27.380
- Director of the Trade Mart?
- Former director.

1:25:27.588 --> 1:25:28.756
Incredible.

1:25:29.090 --> 1:25:31.259
Can you get some sworn statements?

1:25:31.509 --> 1:25:34.095
That'll be tough. Nobody's talking.

1:25:34.929 --> 1:25:37.265
Let's have him in for a chat.

1:25:37.682 --> 1:25:39.684
I hate to get him dragged into this.

1:25:39.767 --> 1:25:43.229
He's done so much for the city,
restoring the Quarter.

1:25:43.563 --> 1:25:47.483
Remember, we saw him at a fund-raiser.
Seems like such a nice man.

1:25:47.817 --> 1:25:51.446
It'll be off the record.
I'll bring him in on a Sunday.

1:25:53.323 --> 1:25:55.742
A quiet little chat between gentlemen.

1:26:12.425 --> 1:26:14.177
In heavy fighting in Vietnam today...

1:26:14.260 --> 1:26:17.513
...seven more American soldiers died
and 23 wounded.

1:26:17.639 --> 1:26:20.600
The body count for this week
now stands at 67 Americans...

1:26:20.683 --> 1:26:23.519
...and 626 enemy soldiers killed in action.

1:26:24.270 --> 1:26:28.358
President Johnson said he regretted
there's no end in sight to the war...

1:26:28.900 --> 1:26:31.527
...where 500,000 US troops
are now fighting.

1:26:31.653 --> 1:26:33.196
We face more cost...

1:26:33.947 --> 1:26:35.198
...more loss...

1:26:35.865 --> 1:26:37.283
...and more agony.

1:26:37.492 --> 1:26:40.036
Come hunt for Easter eggs.

1:26:40.119 --> 1:26:44.457
That's the kids' job. You know I don't like
these tribal rituals, anyway.

1:26:45.249 --> 1:26:47.710
I'm talking to Clay Shaw this morning.

1:26:47.835 --> 1:26:50.254
We're going to Antoine's with the kids!

1:26:50.421 --> 1:26:52.590
I told you I was talking to Shaw.

1:26:52.715 --> 1:26:55.176
In the middle of Easter Sunday?

1:26:55.468 --> 1:26:58.638
When I scheduled it,
I didn't know it was a holiday.

1:26:58.846 --> 1:27:00.556
Look at the calendar!

1:27:00.723 --> 1:27:03.059
You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.

1:27:03.643 --> 1:27:05.228
Clay Shaw is important.

1:27:05.311 --> 1:27:07.605
- And we're not.
- I didn't say that.

1:27:08.940 --> 1:27:10.608
I didn't say that.

1:27:11.484 --> 1:27:14.612
You're missing most of your life
and you don't know it.

1:27:14.696 --> 1:27:16.739
The kids are missing out, too.

1:27:17.407 --> 1:27:21.786
- You're not the only one making sacrifices.
- I'll be there by 2:00, I promise.

1:27:22.704 --> 1:27:24.414
Just start without me.

1:27:33.923 --> 1:27:36.592
Mr. Garrison, what can I do for you
on Easter Sunday?

1:27:36.676 --> 1:27:38.928
I'm sorry to interrupt this holiday.

1:27:39.262 --> 1:27:43.600
But this conversation is best kept out
of the everyday bustle of this office.

1:27:43.933 --> 1:27:45.393
I don't understand.

1:27:45.476 --> 1:27:49.397
In an investigation we're conducting,
your name keeps coming up.

1:27:49.939 --> 1:27:50.982
Can't imagine where.

1:27:51.608 --> 1:27:54.736
We've talked to a number of men
who claim to know you.

1:27:55.445 --> 1:27:57.238
Do you know a David Logan?

1:27:57.363 --> 1:27:59.365
No. Never heard of him.

1:28:00.283 --> 1:28:01.367
Perry Russo?

1:28:01.451 --> 1:28:02.452
No.

1:28:03.536 --> 1:28:05.121
Willie O'Keefe?

1:28:06.539 --> 1:28:08.708
I don't know anyone by that name.

1:28:09.292 --> 1:28:13.129
Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you
at the Masquerade Bar in the Quarter.

1:28:14.047 --> 1:28:17.925
Then you had him over for dinner
at your apartment on Dauphine Street.

1:28:18.009 --> 1:28:20.845
- Do you recall that?
- I don't know this man.

1:28:22.055 --> 1:28:23.556
Be still my heart.

1:28:23.932 --> 1:28:26.392
Obviously, I wouldn't have him over.

1:28:26.476 --> 1:28:28.102
Hope you like squab.

1:28:30.063 --> 1:28:31.272
Champagne?

1:28:31.814 --> 1:28:36.277
Perhaps a few more details about
the evening will refresh your memory.

1:28:42.408 --> 1:28:46.621
Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served
by a uniformed waiter, a colored man.

1:28:47.789 --> 1:28:51.960
You sat at one end and he at the other,
which he found unusual...

1:28:52.669 --> 1:28:54.837
...because the table was so long.

1:28:55.254 --> 1:28:56.589
How was your mousse?

1:28:56.673 --> 1:28:59.008
Bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?

1:28:59.092 --> 1:29:00.385
Not at all.

1:29:01.094 --> 1:29:02.762
But I do have...

1:29:02.845 --> 1:29:05.265
...a lovely Chippendale dining table.

1:29:05.515 --> 1:29:09.143
I often have a friend sit at one end
while I sit at the other.

1:29:09.310 --> 1:29:12.563
It's precisely the point
of a long dining table.

1:29:13.231 --> 1:29:15.984
The splendor of the meal
adds to its enjoyment.

1:29:16.359 --> 1:29:18.361
I imagine a uniformed waiter helps.

1:29:18.444 --> 1:29:20.947
It adds elegance, for which I confess...

1:29:21.197 --> 1:29:22.991
...a weakness now and then.

1:29:23.491 --> 1:29:24.993
I call him Smedley.

1:29:25.994 --> 1:29:30.331
His real name's Frankie Jenkins,
but it would be so uncouth during dinner...

1:29:31.082 --> 1:29:33.293
...to turn toward the kitchen and holler...

1:29:33.376 --> 1:29:34.877
..."Frankie! "

1:29:39.882 --> 1:29:41.843
Where is all this leading to?

1:29:42.218 --> 1:29:44.178
After dinner, you paid him to have sex.

1:29:47.890 --> 1:29:49.976
That is absolute nonsense.

1:29:50.727 --> 1:29:54.897
The Quarter is filled
with vivid imaginations, dear Mr. Garrison.

1:29:55.148 --> 1:29:58.109
Grimy young hoodlums who will say
and do anything!

1:29:58.610 --> 1:30:00.236
Mr. O'Keefe told us...

1:30:00.612 --> 1:30:03.906
...David Ferrie came to the house
with another young man.

1:30:05.992 --> 1:30:07.785
- Who?
- David Ferrie.

1:30:09.078 --> 1:30:10.747
I don't know that name.

1:30:11.205 --> 1:30:14.876
Never having met Mr. O'Keefe,
I couldn't have met Mr. Ferrie.

1:30:28.473 --> 1:30:29.933
You're mine, Mary.

1:30:30.808 --> 1:30:33.895
The four of you partied early
into the morning hours.

1:30:34.020 --> 1:30:35.563
Look at this picture.

1:30:36.522 --> 1:30:39.400
I've never met anyone
of such bizarre appearance.

1:30:48.242 --> 1:30:52.038
Only way you get this,
you do exactly what I say. I'm the man.

1:30:54.123 --> 1:30:56.334
You know the name Clay Bertrand?

1:30:56.542 --> 1:30:57.835
Clay Bertrand.

1:30:59.045 --> 1:31:02.465
A man with a similar name worked
at the Chamber of Commerce.

1:31:02.548 --> 1:31:05.301
- That the man you had in mind?
- No, it was not.

1:31:06.302 --> 1:31:08.429
Can you identify this man?

1:31:08.972 --> 1:31:12.767
Naturally. You claim Mr. Oswald
also had dinner with me?

1:31:13.059 --> 1:31:15.687
Have you ever met Lee Harvey Oswald?

1:31:16.312 --> 1:31:19.983
You have me consorting
with a sordid cast of characters.

1:31:20.108 --> 1:31:22.652
- Please answer the question.
- 'Course not.

1:31:23.111 --> 1:31:24.946
The assassination was such a pity.

1:31:25.029 --> 1:31:28.700
In fact I admired Kennedy.
Man of true panache.

1:31:28.866 --> 1:31:30.702
Wife of impeccable taste.

1:31:31.244 --> 1:31:34.455
Let's order without your daddy.
He won't mind.

1:31:34.831 --> 1:31:36.582
I want a Shirley Temple!

1:31:36.791 --> 1:31:38.960
Kids, put your water guns away.

1:31:39.544 --> 1:31:41.129
When's Daddy coming?

1:31:42.130 --> 1:31:43.631
He's coming soon.

1:31:43.923 --> 1:31:47.260
He's sorry he's late,
but he promised he'd be here.

1:31:47.427 --> 1:31:49.929
Daddy never keeps his promises.

1:31:54.225 --> 1:31:56.894
This Italian newspaper article says...

1:31:57.562 --> 1:32:01.190
...you were a board member
of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy.

1:32:01.482 --> 1:32:05.612
This company was created by the CIA
for the transfer of funds in Italy...

1:32:05.695 --> 1:32:08.448
...for illegal
political-espionage activities.

1:32:08.698 --> 1:32:12.619
Says that this company was expelled
from Italy for those activities.

1:32:12.827 --> 1:32:17.206
I'm well aware of that asinine article.
I'm thinking of suing that rag.

1:32:17.290 --> 1:32:21.210
It also says this company is linked
to the Schlumberger Tool Company...

1:32:21.294 --> 1:32:25.131
...in Louisiana, which provided arms
to David Ferrie and his Cubans.

1:32:25.298 --> 1:32:26.716
You're reaching.

1:32:26.799 --> 1:32:27.800
Am I?

1:32:27.884 --> 1:32:31.471
I'm an international businessman.
The Trade Mart I founded...

1:32:31.596 --> 1:32:35.725
...is America's commercial pipeline
to Latin America. I trade everywhere.

1:32:36.517 --> 1:32:39.938
Like all businessmen,
I am accused of all things.

1:32:40.355 --> 1:32:44.567
I go about my business, make money,
help society the best I can...

1:32:44.651 --> 1:32:47.362
...and try to promote free trade
in this world.

1:32:48.821 --> 1:32:51.908
Have you ever been a contract agent
for the CIA?

1:32:56.663 --> 1:32:58.039
And if I were...

1:32:58.915 --> 1:33:02.293
...do you believe I would be here today...

1:33:03.419 --> 1:33:05.505
...talking to somebody like you?

1:33:11.177 --> 1:33:13.805
- People like you don't have to.
- May I go?

1:33:13.930 --> 1:33:16.557
People like you walk
between the raindrops.

1:33:17.934 --> 1:33:19.269
May I go?

1:33:21.354 --> 1:33:22.230
Yes.

1:33:30.697 --> 1:33:35.618
Regardless of what you may think of me,
I am a patriot first and foremost.

1:33:35.702 --> 1:33:38.121
I've spent half my life in the military...

1:33:38.204 --> 1:33:40.039
...defending my country.

1:33:40.123 --> 1:33:44.335
You're the first person I've met who
considers it patriotic to kill the President.

1:33:44.419 --> 1:33:46.296
You are way out of line.

1:33:46.838 --> 1:33:50.174
It's getting late.
That's all the questions we have.

1:33:50.591 --> 1:33:53.261
Thank you for your honesty
and for coming in.

1:33:53.344 --> 1:33:55.179
I enjoyed meeting with you.

1:33:56.306 --> 1:33:59.267
And you, Miss Cox.
It's been most pleasant.

1:34:04.772 --> 1:34:09.110
I extend to you and your families
my best wishes for a happy Easter.

1:34:18.411 --> 1:34:21.080
"One may smile, and smile
and be a villain. "

1:34:22.415 --> 1:34:24.584
Goddamn it! We've got one of them.

1:34:24.792 --> 1:34:25.710
See that?

1:34:43.019 --> 1:34:44.354
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

1:34:49.108 --> 1:34:50.318
Tough day.

1:34:50.401 --> 1:34:51.986
Where you been?

1:34:52.946 --> 1:34:54.447
My sympathies.

1:34:54.530 --> 1:34:57.867
I'm sorry, the meeting
took much longer than expected.

1:34:58.242 --> 1:34:59.744
Just a second.

1:34:59.827 --> 1:35:02.622
We waited for hours, Jim!

1:35:04.207 --> 1:35:06.084
You could've telephoned.

1:35:06.167 --> 1:35:10.755
I can only say I'm sorry.
I just don't have rabbits on my mind.

1:35:11.756 --> 1:35:13.341
You know what I think?

1:35:13.424 --> 1:35:16.552
You care more about John Kennedy
than your own family.

1:35:17.053 --> 1:35:20.974
All day the kids asked, "Where's Daddy?"
What should I tell them?

1:35:21.891 --> 1:35:23.268
I don't know!

1:35:23.559 --> 1:35:26.562
The truth! I'm doing my job
to make sure they grow up...

1:35:26.646 --> 1:35:30.817
...in a country where justice won't be
a vanished idea in history books...

1:35:30.942 --> 1:35:33.111
...like dinosaurs or Atlantis.

1:35:33.236 --> 1:35:36.197
It doesn't replace a husband
or a father on Easter Sunday.

1:35:36.281 --> 1:35:38.116
It's going to get worse!

1:35:44.038 --> 1:35:46.249
I beat you again, you must give me a raise.

1:35:46.332 --> 1:35:48.459
Who can you brag to?

1:35:50.837 --> 1:35:54.173
Who killed President Kennedy?
Was there a conspiracy here?

1:35:54.382 --> 1:35:56.801
I don't know what you're talking about.

1:35:57.677 --> 1:36:00.221
Clear the door! Watch out! Move!

1:36:02.974 --> 1:36:05.226
Congratulations. You're Page One.

1:36:05.393 --> 1:36:10.773
Ain't nice, it says, we've spent over $8,000
on unexplained investigative expenses...

1:36:10.857 --> 1:36:12.567
...since November, 1966.

1:36:12.775 --> 1:36:13.901
Goddamn!

1:36:14.193 --> 1:36:18.364
They went to the public records, got
vouchers we requested for withdrawals.

1:36:18.615 --> 1:36:20.366
Shaw got them on our tail.

1:36:20.533 --> 1:36:23.620
It could have been Ferrie,
Martin, Andrews, any of them.

1:36:23.703 --> 1:36:27.498
Or they talked to Ruby 'cause of
they're on our asses for a measly $8,000.

1:36:27.582 --> 1:36:29.751
They're hunting the news,
it's their business.

1:36:29.834 --> 1:36:32.545
You'd think they'd understand
what were doing.

1:36:32.795 --> 1:36:35.590
Getting angry doesn't accomplish
a damn thing.

1:36:37.925 --> 1:36:39.177
Son of a bitch.

1:36:39.886 --> 1:36:42.096
This changes everything now.

1:36:42.597 --> 1:36:43.973
What do you mean?

1:36:46.434 --> 1:36:50.021
Either we pull out now
or we go through heavy flak together.

1:36:52.899 --> 1:36:56.819
Bear in mind, this may affect
the rest of your careers, your lives.

1:36:58.112 --> 1:37:00.323
Any one who wants to pull out now...

1:37:00.615 --> 1:37:05.828
...I assure you there will be no ill feelings
and I will reassign you to regular duties.

1:37:09.499 --> 1:37:11.709
There it is then, thank you.

1:37:12.251 --> 1:37:14.128
It means a great deal to me.

1:37:17.298 --> 1:37:20.802
I'm giving this office $6,000
from my National Guard savings account.

1:37:21.886 --> 1:37:23.346
So we can continue.

1:37:24.097 --> 1:37:27.350
I'll make speeches where I can
and make additional money.

1:37:27.892 --> 1:37:30.895
What shall I tell them?
Their piling up outside the door.

1:37:30.979 --> 1:37:33.773
They want a statement.
The phones are going crazy.

1:37:33.856 --> 1:37:36.818
I won't confirm, deny nor discuss, Sharon.

1:37:38.444 --> 1:37:40.405
Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen.

1:37:42.448 --> 1:37:45.285
I'm going home
to get a decent day's work done.

1:37:45.368 --> 1:37:49.205
Mr. Garrison's own silence on the subject
has raised some interesting questions.

1:37:49.330 --> 1:37:53.001
With taxpayer money,
has he uncovered valuable new evidence?

1:37:53.418 --> 1:37:58.214
Or is he merely saving the information
to gain exposure at a national level?

1:37:58.423 --> 1:38:01.342
Mr. Garrison should have
some explanation.

1:38:01.509 --> 1:38:03.970
Did your office plant that garbage
in the paper?

1:38:04.053 --> 1:38:06.014
- Who is this?
- You know damn well.

1:38:06.139 --> 1:38:08.099
- Dave?
- You got it. Listen.

1:38:08.391 --> 1:38:10.435
You're the only straight-shooter there.

1:38:10.560 --> 1:38:12.520
I want an answer! Did you plant it?

1:38:12.604 --> 1:38:16.190
Do you think we're nuts?
It's been a zoo since that broke.

1:38:16.357 --> 1:38:18.735
Reporters everywhere.
Do you think we want that?

1:38:18.860 --> 1:38:21.613
Somebody planted that fucking story!

1:38:21.696 --> 1:38:25.366
I'm one of fucking Garrison's suspects.
I can't go home!

1:38:25.533 --> 1:38:28.620
The maggots are everywhere!
Do you know what you've done to me?

1:38:28.703 --> 1:38:30.038
Calm down.

1:38:30.121 --> 1:38:31.331
From here on...

1:38:31.581 --> 1:38:33.458
...I'm a fucking dead man!

1:38:33.708 --> 1:38:36.377
You weren't even mentioned in the story.

1:38:37.170 --> 1:38:40.340
Meet me in the lobby
of the Fontainebleau in 20 minutes.

1:38:40.923 --> 1:38:45.386
I guarantee the boss will protect you.
He likes you. He likes your mind.

1:38:50.224 --> 1:38:52.560
I just don't know who to trust anymore.

1:38:52.685 --> 1:38:56.981
I suppose I could use a pot of hot coffee
and a few packs of Luckys.

1:38:58.483 --> 1:38:59.692
Anything new?

1:39:00.109 --> 1:39:01.903
Who are you scared of?

1:39:02.070 --> 1:39:04.656
Everybody. The Agency, mob, Cubans.

1:39:06.074 --> 1:39:07.367
Follow the Cubans.

1:39:07.492 --> 1:39:10.411
Check them out. Here, in Miami. Dallas.

1:39:11.871 --> 1:39:14.123
Check out Eladio del Valle.

1:39:14.290 --> 1:39:17.627
He was my paymaster
when I flew missions into Cuba.

1:39:17.919 --> 1:39:21.631
You're on the right track.
Don't write this down!

1:39:21.965 --> 1:39:24.259
I ain't cooperating with no one!

1:39:24.759 --> 1:39:27.595
There's a death warrant for me!
Don't you get it?

1:39:28.054 --> 1:39:29.931
Damn! Wait a minute!

1:39:30.014 --> 1:39:32.850
You ain't bugged, are you?
Son of a bitch, Lou!

1:39:33.268 --> 1:39:34.352
Are you?

1:39:34.727 --> 1:39:36.437
I play square. No bugs.

1:39:36.813 --> 1:39:40.358
I'd love you to go on the record,
but I'm in no hurry.

1:39:40.817 --> 1:39:42.902
I haven't slept since that article.

1:39:43.027 --> 1:39:46.990
- Why'd you get me involved?
- Did we involve you? Or did Shaw?

1:39:47.573 --> 1:39:50.493
Cocksucking faggot.
He got me by the balls.

1:39:50.785 --> 1:39:53.788
- What do you mean?
- Photographs, compromising stuff.

1:39:54.247 --> 1:39:55.415
He'll use them, too.

1:39:55.540 --> 1:39:57.166
Agency plays for keeps.

1:39:57.458 --> 1:40:01.129
Oswald was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.
I taught him everything.

1:40:01.838 --> 1:40:05.300
He was a wannabe. No one liked him.
Thought he was a snitch.

1:40:05.550 --> 1:40:07.010
But I treated him good.

1:40:07.093 --> 1:40:10.013
He wanted his kid to grow up
with a chance.

1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:12.640
What's this? What's going on?

1:40:14.851 --> 1:40:16.144
Don't let him in.

1:40:16.269 --> 1:40:18.062
No one's coming in here.

1:40:21.608 --> 1:40:22.859
Black. Give it to me.

1:40:22.984 --> 1:40:25.528
Black. My neck is killing me.

1:40:26.404 --> 1:40:30.283
I've had cancer for years.
Been working with mice to find a cure.

1:40:30.742 --> 1:40:32.452
Did you work for the CIA?

1:40:33.411 --> 1:40:36.748
You sound like it's a remote experience
in ancient history.

1:40:37.081 --> 1:40:38.916
You don't leave the Agency.

1:40:40.084 --> 1:40:43.129
- Once you're in, they got you for life.
- And Shaw?

1:40:43.671 --> 1:40:46.341
Shaw's an untouchable. Highest clearance.

1:40:46.674 --> 1:40:49.344
Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans, all Agency.

1:40:50.762 --> 1:40:51.679
Ruby?

1:40:55.808 --> 1:40:58.686
Jack was a pimp.
A bagman for the Dallas mob.

1:40:59.062 --> 1:41:01.648
Ran guns to Castro
when he was on our side.

1:41:01.856 --> 1:41:04.525
Castro was almost with us
till we tried to whack him.

1:41:04.609 --> 1:41:06.611
Everybody keeps flipping sides.

1:41:06.694 --> 1:41:08.279
It's fun and games.

1:41:08.529 --> 1:41:11.908
- How do the mob figure in this?
- They're Agency too.

1:41:12.158 --> 1:41:17.372
The CIA and the Mafia worked together
for years trying to whack out the beard.

1:41:17.830 --> 1:41:20.166
There's more to this than you could dream!

1:41:20.249 --> 1:41:23.503
Check out something called
"Operation Mongoose. "

1:41:23.920 --> 1:41:27.131
Government, Pentagon stuff.
They're in charge.

1:41:27.632 --> 1:41:30.343
But who pulls whose chain? Who knows?

1:41:31.135 --> 1:41:34.222
"Oh, what a deadly web we weave
when we practice to deceive. "

1:41:34.305 --> 1:41:35.890
Who killed the President?

1:41:35.974 --> 1:41:38.685
Why don't you fucking stop it? Shit!

1:41:39.978 --> 1:41:42.647
This is too big for you, you know that?

1:41:42.730 --> 1:41:47.235
Who did the President? Fuck!
It's a mystery.

1:41:47.610 --> 1:41:50.321
It's a mystery wrapped in a riddle
inside an enigma!

1:41:50.405 --> 1:41:53.408
The shooters don't even know!
Don't you get it?

1:41:53.533 --> 1:41:56.411
Fuck, man! I can't keep talking like this!

1:41:56.703 --> 1:41:58.663
They'll fucking kill me!

1:41:58.830 --> 1:42:00.540
I'll fucking die!

1:42:04.836 --> 1:42:06.254
Son of a bitch!

1:42:06.337 --> 1:42:07.880
It's all right.

1:42:09.757 --> 1:42:11.593
I don't know what happened.

1:42:12.343 --> 1:42:13.511
Fuck!

1:42:20.184 --> 1:42:22.437
All I wanted in the world...

1:42:24.689 --> 1:42:26.858
...was to be a Catholic priest.

1:42:28.026 --> 1:42:29.694
Live in a monastery.

1:42:29.861 --> 1:42:31.237
Pray. Serve God.

1:42:32.905 --> 1:42:34.073
I had...

1:42:36.492 --> 1:42:38.995
...one terrible fucking weakness.

1:42:39.746 --> 1:42:41.539
And they defrocked me!

1:42:45.752 --> 1:42:48.212
Then I started to lose everything.

1:42:50.131 --> 1:42:51.716
You'll be okay, Dave.

1:42:52.008 --> 1:42:55.094
Just talk to us on the record.
We'll protect you.

1:43:01.392 --> 1:43:03.186
They'll get to you too.

1:43:04.604 --> 1:43:06.147
They'll destroy you.

1:43:08.066 --> 1:43:09.609
They're untouchable.

1:43:13.237 --> 1:43:16.407
I'm so fucking exhausted,
I can't see straight.

1:43:31.547 --> 1:43:33.424
Early for Mardi Gras, isn't it?

1:43:33.508 --> 1:43:36.177
Paris Match,
the largest magazine in France.

1:43:37.053 --> 1:43:39.138
Literaturnaya Gazeta from Moscow.

1:43:39.222 --> 1:43:41.266
Victoria Taylor, Private Eye.

1:43:42.225 --> 1:43:45.270
You know who shot the President?
Mr. Garrison is too busy...

1:43:45.353 --> 1:43:47.939
They're putting the heat on David Ferrie.

1:43:48.648 --> 1:43:51.067
If we wait, he won't hold on.

1:43:53.027 --> 1:43:57.115
He keeps changing his story.
We can't call him to a grand jury.

1:43:58.199 --> 1:44:02.495
He'll keep deteriorating.
We'll get more out of him when he cracks.

1:44:03.579 --> 1:44:07.375
If we call him in now he might freeze up,
we'll lose our best shot.

1:44:07.959 --> 1:44:11.629
He can't go down any further.
We must protect him full time.

1:44:12.672 --> 1:44:15.341
I know what you're going through
with Ferrie.

1:44:15.675 --> 1:44:19.929
We'll talk tomorrow.
I have to catch a plane to Washington.

1:44:21.764 --> 1:44:25.184
A lead says he's closely connected
to these events...

1:44:25.518 --> 1:44:27.061
...but he won't come here.

1:44:27.145 --> 1:44:30.273
I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster,
Eladio del Valle.

1:44:30.690 --> 1:44:33.443
I need more men. I got to get him in.

1:44:33.526 --> 1:44:36.863
I can't pull the teams to watch Ferrie.
I promised him!

1:44:37.030 --> 1:44:38.740
This is our case!

1:44:42.076 --> 1:44:43.995
I got something to show you.

1:44:44.329 --> 1:44:46.914
I think you'll find it interesting.

1:44:49.667 --> 1:44:51.502
This was found in your office.

1:44:51.586 --> 1:44:55.423
The conference room is bugged, maybe
the phones. We have to debug the place.

1:44:55.506 --> 1:44:58.509
Bugging the DA's office.
This is outrageous!

1:45:00.053 --> 1:45:02.639
Believe what you want,
but we must be more careful.

1:45:02.722 --> 1:45:04.807
All these new volunteers!

1:45:06.017 --> 1:45:09.771
You handle it, okay?
I don't have time for this nonsense.

1:45:12.190 --> 1:45:15.443
Well, we obviously got
the bastards worried now.

1:45:18.363 --> 1:45:20.448
I'm coming to Washington!

1:45:25.954 --> 1:45:27.747
Dave Ferrie's dead.

1:45:28.373 --> 1:45:31.042
Found his body in his apartment
two hours ago.

1:45:56.359 --> 1:45:57.735
What's it look like?

1:45:57.819 --> 1:46:02.490
I don't see any violence. Heart attack,
maybe an aneurysm. Natural causes.

1:46:02.573 --> 1:46:05.410
This is addressed to no one
and no signature.

1:46:05.702 --> 1:46:08.579
"To leave this life is
for me a sweet prospect.

1:46:08.871 --> 1:46:11.249
"I find nothing in it that is desirable...

1:46:11.332 --> 1:46:14.585
"... and, on the other hand,
everything that is loathsome. "

1:46:14.669 --> 1:46:16.379
It goes on and on.

1:46:16.671 --> 1:46:21.009
"Daily we are propagandized more
and more by the rising crime wave. "

1:46:21.593 --> 1:46:24.095
Seems pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.

1:46:45.116 --> 1:46:46.159
Proloid.

1:46:48.745 --> 1:46:51.623
I took it once for a low thyroid condition.

1:46:52.332 --> 1:46:54.250
It raises the metabolism.

1:46:55.752 --> 1:46:59.297
Ferrie strike you as the kind of person
with a low metabolism?

1:46:59.380 --> 1:47:02.675
Hardly, I'd say the opposite.
Maybe hypertension.

1:47:03.384 --> 1:47:08.222
Ferrie was the only one to express
any kind of remorse about the whole thing.

1:47:09.807 --> 1:47:11.601
I think it got him killed.

1:47:13.603 --> 1:47:15.313
More bad news from Miami.

1:47:15.521 --> 1:47:18.274
Ferrie's friend, Eladio del Valle,
was found...

1:47:19.233 --> 1:47:21.736
...hacked to death with a machete
in his car.

1:47:21.819 --> 1:47:26.783
He was tortured, shot point-blank in
the heart, his skull split open with an ax.

1:47:26.950 --> 1:47:28.743
Ain't that the devil's piss!

1:47:28.826 --> 1:47:32.038
Found another note. Same thing.
No name. No signature.

1:47:32.372 --> 1:47:36.793
"When you receive this, I'll be quite dead,
so no answer is possible.

1:47:37.251 --> 1:47:41.965
- "I offered you love, I got kicked. "
- Must've pressed to come up with that.

1:47:44.217 --> 1:47:48.846
What if a man with hypertension
were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?

1:47:49.305 --> 1:47:53.935
He'd die quickly. A heart storm
or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.

1:47:54.644 --> 1:47:57.647
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid
in his system?

1:47:57.814 --> 1:47:59.607
Not with a routine autopsy.

1:47:59.774 --> 1:48:03.194
But there may be a high level of iodine
in the spinal fluid.

1:48:03.278 --> 1:48:06.281
But it's difficult to know.
What're you thinking?

1:48:08.032 --> 1:48:11.494
It doesn't make sense.
Would a man afraid of dying...

1:48:11.911 --> 1:48:14.664
...kill himself in a way
that leaves no trace?

1:48:15.832 --> 1:48:18.334
And leave two unsigned suicide notes?

1:48:18.960 --> 1:48:21.671
If it's a suicide, I've seen weirder.

1:48:22.547 --> 1:48:25.633
The fact is, he's gone. And so is our case.

1:48:25.800 --> 1:48:27.343
Unless we go for Shaw now.

1:48:27.427 --> 1:48:30.722
With whose testimony?
O'Keefe, a male prostitute?

1:48:31.389 --> 1:48:34.392
Jack Martin, a drunk?
Vernon Bundy, a dope fiend?

1:48:34.517 --> 1:48:38.396
Shaw's got respect. Newspaper editors,
American Bar Association.

1:48:38.479 --> 1:48:42.066
- I agree. We don't have the goods.
- We wait, Shaw will get whacked!

1:48:42.150 --> 1:48:45.069
How many corpses do you need
to figure out what's going on?

1:48:45.153 --> 1:48:47.780
Watch your mouth! Ferrie did this himself.

1:48:48.823 --> 1:48:50.283
Where're you going?

1:48:50.366 --> 1:48:51.701
I don't know.

1:48:51.909 --> 1:48:53.620
I just don't know.

1:48:58.875 --> 1:49:01.419
Frank, you're wasting your time here.

1:49:01.502 --> 1:49:03.880
Big Jim gave strict orders. No FBl.

1:49:04.172 --> 1:49:05.840
It's you I want to talk to.

1:49:05.924 --> 1:49:08.551
Boss'd fry me in hog fat
if he knew I talked to you.

1:49:08.635 --> 1:49:11.054
Boss's got a problem. Real serious.

1:49:11.387 --> 1:49:14.682
- We know what's going on at your office.
- I guess you do.

1:49:14.807 --> 1:49:18.770
You got nothing. I'm a friend.
You're riding on the Titanic.

1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:21.773
Time to jump off
before you get destroyed, too.

1:49:22.231 --> 1:49:23.232
Enough!

1:49:23.316 --> 1:49:26.444
We're talking about your career.
You're young.

1:49:27.362 --> 1:49:29.197
You're working the Castro thing.

1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:30.782
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

1:49:30.865 --> 1:49:34.327
We know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.
Castro did.

1:49:34.911 --> 1:49:36.996
If it comes out, there'll be a war.

1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:41.501
Millions of people will die.
That's more important than Jim Garrison.

1:49:41.751 --> 1:49:44.879
Look at me when I talk to you!
You're too selfish!

1:49:45.171 --> 1:49:46.464
Shut up!

1:49:47.048 --> 1:49:51.261
If you got a brain in your thick skull,
listen to me. Listen real hard.

1:49:52.428 --> 1:49:53.721
Get in the car.

1:50:15.660 --> 1:50:16.911
Garrison?

1:50:18.121 --> 1:50:18.997
Yes.

1:50:20.206 --> 1:50:21.541
Glad you came.

1:50:21.958 --> 1:50:23.876
Sorry about the precautions.

1:50:23.960 --> 1:50:26.462
I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...?

1:50:27.630 --> 1:50:31.384
I could give you a false name,
but I won't. Call me "X."

1:50:32.927 --> 1:50:37.390
I've already been warned by the Agency,
so, if this is another threat-

1:50:37.974 --> 1:50:40.310
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison.

1:50:41.185 --> 1:50:44.981
If you've come this far,
what I have to say interests you.

1:50:45.148 --> 1:50:48.318
I won't name names or tell you who
or what I represent.

1:50:49.110 --> 1:50:50.903
Except to say you're close.

1:50:52.238 --> 1:50:53.906
Closer than you think.

1:50:57.619 --> 1:51:00.747
Everything I'll say
is classified top secret.

1:51:01.247 --> 1:51:04.167
I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison. Two wars.

1:51:05.251 --> 1:51:09.172
A secret Pentagon guy,
supplying the hardware:

1:51:09.255 --> 1:51:11.090
Planes, bullets, rifles...

1:51:11.424 --> 1:51:13.843
...for what we call "Black Operations. "

1:51:14.260 --> 1:51:16.763
Black Ops. Assassinations. Coups d'etat...

1:51:16.846 --> 1:51:19.682
...rigging elections,
propaganda, psych warfare.

1:51:20.808 --> 1:51:24.395
In World War ll, I was in Romania,
Greece, Yugoslavia.

1:51:24.771 --> 1:51:29.025
I helped evacuate part of Nazi intelligence
at the end of the war.

1:51:29.442 --> 1:51:32.153
And we used those guys
against the Communists.

1:51:32.528 --> 1:51:34.864
In Italy, '48, we stole the elections.

1:51:34.948 --> 1:51:37.367
France '49, we broke the strikes.

1:51:37.742 --> 1:51:40.745
Overthrew Quirino in the Philippines,
Arbenz in Guatemala...

1:51:40.828 --> 1:51:43.748
...Mossadegh in Iran.
We were in Vietnam in '54...

1:51:44.415 --> 1:51:46.626
...Indonesia, '58, Tibet, '59.

1:51:47.210 --> 1:51:50.588
Got the Dalai Lama out. We were good.

1:51:51.714 --> 1:51:53.049
Very good.

1:51:54.008 --> 1:51:56.719
Then we got into the Cuban thing.
Not so good.

1:51:56.886 --> 1:52:00.181
Set up an invasion to take place
in October, '62.

1:52:00.848 --> 1:52:04.185
Khrushchev sent missiles to resist.
Kennedy didn't invade.

1:52:04.769 --> 1:52:07.313
We just had our dicks in the wind.

1:52:07.397 --> 1:52:09.941
A lot of pissed-off people, Mr. Garrison.

1:52:10.566 --> 1:52:11.734
Understand?

1:52:12.277 --> 1:52:13.987
I'll come to that later.

1:52:14.404 --> 1:52:16.281
So, 1963...

1:52:17.365 --> 1:52:19.951
I spent much of September of '63...

1:52:20.410 --> 1:52:23.371
...working on the Kennedy plan
to get all US personnel...

1:52:23.454 --> 1:52:26.165
...out of Vietnam by the end of 1965.

1:52:26.749 --> 1:52:30.503
One of the strongest plans issued
by the Kennedy White House...

1:52:31.421 --> 1:52:33.673
...National Security Memo 263...

1:52:33.965 --> 1:52:36.175
...ordered home the first 1,000 troops.

1:52:37.051 --> 1:52:41.431
But in November, a week after the murder
of Vietnamese President Diem...

1:52:41.514 --> 1:52:44.183
...and two weeks before
Kennedy's assassination...

1:52:44.267 --> 1:52:46.644
...a strange thing happened to me.

1:52:49.105 --> 1:52:50.815
Is Dave in there?

1:52:55.820 --> 1:52:57.822
You wanted to see me, General?

1:52:58.197 --> 1:52:59.449
I do, indeed.

1:52:59.866 --> 1:53:01.909
You're going to the South Pole.

1:53:02.577 --> 1:53:03.578
I am?

1:53:04.370 --> 1:53:06.122
Dr. Mooney's got the details.

1:53:06.205 --> 1:53:08.958
Check with him. Have a nice vacation.

1:53:09.626 --> 1:53:12.587
I was sent by my superior,
we'll call him "Y"...

1:53:13.004 --> 1:53:15.715
...I was sent by General Y
to the South Pole...

1:53:16.424 --> 1:53:20.094
...as military escort for a group
of international VIPs.

1:53:20.595 --> 1:53:23.389
I was on my way back, in New Zealand...

1:53:24.223 --> 1:53:26.184
...when the President was killed.

1:53:28.227 --> 1:53:31.648
Oswald was charged at 7:00 p. m,
Dallas time...

1:53:32.148 --> 1:53:36.444
...with Tippit's murder. That's 2:00 p. m.
the next day in New Zealand.

1:53:37.278 --> 1:53:40.198
But already their papers
had the entire history...

1:53:40.281 --> 1:53:42.951
...of this unknown, 24-year-old Oswald.

1:53:43.368 --> 1:53:46.621
Studio picture, detailed biography,
Russian information...

1:53:46.704 --> 1:53:49.749
...and were sure that he killed
the President alone...

1:53:49.832 --> 1:53:54.128
...although it took them four more hours
to charge him with that crime in Dallas.

1:53:56.547 --> 1:53:58.216
It felt to me as if...

1:53:59.467 --> 1:54:01.678
...a cover story was being put out.

1:54:01.886 --> 1:54:03.805
Like we would in a Black Op.

1:54:05.598 --> 1:54:07.141
After I came back...

1:54:07.350 --> 1:54:10.895
...I asked myself, why was I,
the chief of Special Ops...

1:54:11.062 --> 1:54:13.898
...sent to the South Pole to do a job...

1:54:14.357 --> 1:54:16.276
...many others could have done?

1:54:16.359 --> 1:54:18.528
I wondered if it could've been because...

1:54:18.611 --> 1:54:21.155
...a routine duty,
if I'd been in Washington...

1:54:21.239 --> 1:54:24.033
...would've been to order
additional security in Texas.

1:54:24.117 --> 1:54:27.662
I checked it out and found that someone...

1:54:27.745 --> 1:54:32.500
...told the 112th Military Intelligence
Group at Fort Sam Houston...

1:54:32.709 --> 1:54:36.629
...to stand down that day,
over the protests of Colonel Reich.

1:54:37.630 --> 1:54:39.382
I believe it's a mistake.

1:54:39.591 --> 1:54:44.721
It's standard procedure, especially
in a known hostile city like Dallas...

1:54:44.846 --> 1:54:46.973
...to supplement the Secret Service.

1:54:47.056 --> 1:54:50.351
Even if we hadn't let him ride
with the bubble-top off...

1:54:50.852 --> 1:54:54.814
...we would've put 100 to 200 agents
on the sidewalk without question.

1:54:55.398 --> 1:54:59.736
A month before, in Dallas, UN Ambassador
Adlai Stevenson was spit on and hit.

1:54:59.902 --> 1:55:02.822
There had been attempts
on De Gaulle's life in France.

1:55:02.905 --> 1:55:05.700
We'd have arrived days ahead,
studied the route...

1:55:05.783 --> 1:55:07.243
...checked all buildings.

1:55:07.327 --> 1:55:10.330
Never would've allowed open windows
overlooking Dealey.

1:55:10.496 --> 1:55:12.624
Our own snipers
would've covered the area.

1:55:12.749 --> 1:55:15.335
If a window went up,
they'd have been on the radio!

1:55:15.418 --> 1:55:18.796
We'd be watching the crowd:
packages, rolled-up newspapers, coats.

1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:21.215
Never would've let a man
open an umbrella.

1:55:21.382 --> 1:55:24.260
Never would've let the car slow down
to ten miles an hour.

1:55:24.344 --> 1:55:27.096
Or take that unusual curve
at Houston and Elm.

1:55:27.722 --> 1:55:31.017
You'd have felt an Army presence
in the streets that day.

1:55:31.267 --> 1:55:35.855
But none of this happened. It violated
our most basic protection codes.

1:55:36.272 --> 1:55:40.068
And it is the best indication
of a massive plot in Dallas.

1:55:41.402 --> 1:55:43.404
Who could have best done this?

1:55:43.571 --> 1:55:48.868
Black Ops. People in my business.
My superior might call Col. Reich and say:

1:55:48.993 --> 1:55:52.997
"We have another unit coming for security.
You'll stand down. "

1:55:53.873 --> 1:55:57.043
That day, some Army intelligence people
were in Dallas.

1:55:57.377 --> 1:55:59.045
I don't know who or why.

1:55:59.504 --> 1:56:01.339
But they weren't protecting clients.

1:56:01.422 --> 1:56:04.717
And Oswald. Army Intell had
a Lee Harvey Oswald on file.

1:56:06.344 --> 1:56:08.471
Those files have been destroyed.

1:56:08.805 --> 1:56:13.309
Many strange things were happening.
Oswald had nothing to do with them.

1:56:15.270 --> 1:56:17.689
The entire Cabinet was in the Far East.

1:56:17.772 --> 1:56:20.942
A third of a combat division
was returning from Germany...

1:56:21.025 --> 1:56:24.821
...in the air above the United States,
at the time of the shooting.

1:56:24.988 --> 1:56:30.159
At 12:34 p. m, the Washington
telephone system went out for an hour.

1:56:30.576 --> 1:56:32.620
On the plane back to Washington...

1:56:32.704 --> 1:56:35.039
...word was radioed
from the Situations Room...

1:56:35.123 --> 1:56:39.627
...to Johnson that there was one assassin.
Sound like coincidences to you?

1:56:41.296 --> 1:56:42.797
Not for one moment.

1:56:43.381 --> 1:56:45.758
The Cabinet was out of the way.

1:56:46.718 --> 1:56:48.845
Troops for riot control were in the air.

1:56:48.928 --> 1:56:52.432
Telephones were out to stop
the wrong stories from spreading.

1:56:53.141 --> 1:56:54.684
Nothing was left to chance.

1:56:55.101 --> 1:56:57.895
He could not be allowed to escape alive.

1:57:01.024 --> 1:57:03.401
Things were never the same after that.

1:57:04.861 --> 1:57:07.697
Vietnam started for real.
There was an air of...

1:57:08.906 --> 1:57:11.242
...make-believe in the Pentagon and CIA.

1:57:11.326 --> 1:57:15.496
Those of us in Secret Ops knew
the Warren Commission was fiction.

1:57:16.164 --> 1:57:17.957
But there was something...

1:57:18.249 --> 1:57:19.417
...deeper.

1:57:19.792 --> 1:57:20.752
Uglier.

1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:24.255
I knew Allen Dulles well.
I often briefed him in his house.

1:57:24.339 --> 1:57:29.552
But why was he appointed to investigate
Kennedy's death? The man who fired him.

1:57:30.219 --> 1:57:33.389
Dulles, by the way,
was General Y's benefactor.

1:57:35.558 --> 1:57:37.268
I got out in '64.

1:57:38.102 --> 1:57:39.812
Resigned my commission.

1:57:41.481 --> 1:57:45.109
I never realized Kennedy was so dangerous
to the establishment.

1:57:46.194 --> 1:57:47.654
Is that why?

1:57:48.154 --> 1:57:50.823
That's the real question, isn't it? Why?

1:57:51.282 --> 1:57:54.702
The how and the who is just scenery
for the public.

1:57:55.536 --> 1:57:58.373
Oswald, Ruby, Cuba, the Mafia...

1:57:58.998 --> 1:58:00.959
...keeps them guessing, like a game.

1:58:01.042 --> 1:58:04.254
Prevents them from asking
the most important question: why?

1:58:04.337 --> 1:58:07.131
Why was Kennedy killed? Who benefited?

1:58:07.548 --> 1:58:10.760
Who has the power to cover it up? Who?

1:58:14.347 --> 1:58:15.682
In 1961...

1:58:17.267 --> 1:58:20.853
...right after the Bay of Pigs,
very few people know this...

1:58:21.271 --> 1:58:25.900
...I participated in drawing up
National Security Action Memos 55, 56, 57.

1:58:26.359 --> 1:58:29.195
These are documents classified top secret.

1:58:29.696 --> 1:58:33.533
In them, Kennedy told Gen. Lemnitzer,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs...

1:58:33.616 --> 1:58:37.704
...that from here on, the Joint Chiefs
would be wholly responsible...

1:58:37.870 --> 1:58:40.873
...for all covert paramilitary action
in peacetime.

1:58:41.457 --> 1:58:43.501
This ended the reign of the CIA.

1:58:44.043 --> 1:58:47.547
Splintered it into 1,000 pieces,
as JFK promised he would.

1:58:47.797 --> 1:58:50.008
And now he was ordering the military...

1:58:50.133 --> 1:58:52.427
...to help him do it. Unprecedented!

1:58:52.552 --> 1:58:57.098
I can't tell you the shock waves this sent
along the corridors of power.

1:58:57.390 --> 1:58:59.434
This and the firing of Allen Dulles...

1:58:59.559 --> 1:59:01.936
...Richard Bissell and Gen. Charles Cabell.

1:59:02.061 --> 1:59:05.398
All were sacred cows in Intell
since World War ll.

1:59:05.857 --> 1:59:07.984
They got some very upset people.

1:59:09.068 --> 1:59:12.071
Kennedy's directives weren't implemented
because of...

1:59:12.155 --> 1:59:14.282
...bureaucratic resistance.

1:59:15.158 --> 1:59:17.118
But one of the results was...

1:59:17.452 --> 1:59:20.955
...the Cuban operation was turned over
to my department...

1:59:21.664 --> 1:59:23.708
...as Operation Mongoose.

1:59:24.208 --> 1:59:26.419
Mongoose was pure Black Ops.

1:59:26.836 --> 1:59:29.923
It was secretly based at Miami University...

1:59:30.340 --> 1:59:33.176
...which has the largest
domestic CIA station...

1:59:33.509 --> 1:59:36.512
...budgeted annually for hundreds
of millions of dollars.

1:59:36.638 --> 1:59:39.182
Three hundred agents, 7,000 select Cubans.

1:59:40.058 --> 1:59:42.727
Fifty fake business fronts
to launder money.

1:59:42.936 --> 1:59:45.480
They waged a non-stop war against Castro.

1:59:45.813 --> 1:59:48.191
Industrial sabotage, crop burning, etc.

1:59:48.691 --> 1:59:50.818
All under the control of General Y.

1:59:51.611 --> 1:59:54.280
He took the rules of covert warfare
he'd used abroad...

1:59:54.405 --> 1:59:56.282
...and brought them to this country.

1:59:56.366 --> 1:59:59.118
Now he had the people,
the equipment, the bases...

1:59:59.202 --> 2:00:00.828
...and the motivation.

2:00:01.037 --> 2:00:05.333
Don't underestimate the budget cuts
that Kennedy called for in March of 1963.

2:00:05.792 --> 2:00:08.544
Nearly 52 military installations
in 25 states.

2:00:08.878 --> 2:00:10.588
Twenty-one overseas bases.

2:00:11.214 --> 2:00:12.590
Big money.

2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:16.010
You know how many helicopters
have been lost in Vietnam?

2:00:17.011 --> 2:00:18.805
Nearly 3,000 so far.

2:00:19.806 --> 2:00:22.976
Who makes them?
Bell Helicopter. Who owns Bell?

2:00:23.226 --> 2:00:26.938
Bell was nearly bankrupt when First
National Bank of Boston asked the CIA...

2:00:27.063 --> 2:00:31.109
...to use the helicopter in Indochina.
How about the F-111 fighter?

2:00:31.651 --> 2:00:34.821
General Dynamics of Fort Worth, Texas.
Who owns that?

2:00:34.904 --> 2:00:39.617
Find out the defense budget since
the war began. $75 going on $100 billion.

2:00:39.951 --> 2:00:42.954
Nearly $200 billion will be spent
before it's over.

2:00:43.329 --> 2:00:45.290
In 1949, it was $10 billion.

2:00:45.581 --> 2:00:47.292
No war... no money.

2:00:48.418 --> 2:00:52.005
The organizing principle
of any society, Mr. Garrison...

2:00:52.130 --> 2:00:53.590
...is for war.

2:00:53.965 --> 2:00:57.927
The authority of the state over its people
resides in its war powers.

2:00:58.428 --> 2:01:01.431
Kennedy wanted to end the Cold War
in his second term.

2:01:01.514 --> 2:01:04.934
He wanted to call off the moon race
and cooperate with the Soviets.

2:01:05.059 --> 2:01:07.604
He signed a treaty to ban nuclear testing.

2:01:07.770 --> 2:01:10.273
He refused to invade Cuba in 1962.

2:01:10.607 --> 2:01:12.984
He set out to withdraw from Vietnam.

2:01:14.485 --> 2:01:18.239
But all that ended
on the 22nd of November, 1963.

2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:23.620
Since 1961, they knew Kennedy
was not going to war in Southeast Asia.

2:01:23.995 --> 2:01:26.497
Like Caesar, he is surrounded by enemies.

2:01:26.623 --> 2:01:31.085
Something's underway, but it has no face.
Yet, everybody in the loop knows.

2:01:31.294 --> 2:01:33.087
Forget about combat troops.

2:01:33.212 --> 2:01:36.841
He told McNamara he would pull out
the goddamn advisors!

2:01:38.259 --> 2:01:42.305
He fucked us in Laos and now
he will fuck us in Vietnam!

2:01:42.805 --> 2:01:45.850
He can't afford to implement it
before the election.

2:01:46.059 --> 2:01:48.353
I hear the NSC meeting
was a real barn burner.

2:01:48.478 --> 2:01:53.107
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
Heads will roll. Hear about Lemnitzer?

2:01:53.483 --> 2:01:54.317
What?

2:01:54.442 --> 2:01:56.569
Kennedy rubbed Lem's nose in shit.

2:01:56.819 --> 2:01:59.614
Said if we didn't go into Cuba,
which was so close...

2:01:59.739 --> 2:02:02.450
...why go into Vietnam
which is so far away?

2:02:02.784 --> 2:02:04.285
There he goes again.

2:02:04.369 --> 2:02:06.537
Got his hand on the chicken switch.

2:02:06.788 --> 2:02:10.166
Lem said that the Chiefs still think
we should go into Cuba.

2:02:10.291 --> 2:02:11.417
Money's at stake.

2:02:11.542 --> 2:02:13.586
Big money. $100 billion.

2:02:14.963 --> 2:02:17.799
Kennedy bred voting districts
for defense dollars.

2:02:17.882 --> 2:02:22.220
He gave TFX fighter contracts only
to those counties that will matter in '64.

2:02:22.553 --> 2:02:25.306
The people in the loop fight back.
Their way.

2:02:25.807 --> 2:02:28.268
We have to control the intelligence
from Saigon.

2:02:28.351 --> 2:02:32.021
We just don't let McNamara
stick his nose in this thing!

2:02:32.522 --> 2:02:36.442
Every time he goes over to Saigon
for a fact-finding mission...

2:02:36.651 --> 2:02:39.654
...he comes back
and scares the shit out of Kennedy!

2:02:39.904 --> 2:02:41.489
Now I want Max Taylor
on him night and day...

2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:44.158
...like a fly on shit.

2:02:44.867 --> 2:02:49.122
You control McNamara,
you control Kennedy.

2:02:49.205 --> 2:02:50.832
I think it started like that.

2:02:50.915 --> 2:02:52.333
In the wind.

2:02:52.500 --> 2:02:55.962
Defense contractors, oil bankers.
Just conversation.

2:02:56.588 --> 2:03:00.216
A call is made. Maybe to someone
like my superior officer General Y.

2:03:01.801 --> 2:03:04.220
We're going. We need your help.

2:03:04.596 --> 2:03:05.680
When?

2:03:06.222 --> 2:03:08.850
In the fall. Probably in the South.

2:03:09.225 --> 2:03:12.103
- We want you to come up with a plan.
- I can do that.

2:03:12.186 --> 2:03:13.813
Everything is cellularized.

2:03:13.896 --> 2:03:17.483
No one said, "He must die. " No vote.
Nothing's on paper.

2:03:18.026 --> 2:03:19.736
There's no one to blame.

2:03:20.111 --> 2:03:22.363
It's as old as the crucifixion.

2:03:22.697 --> 2:03:24.616
Or the military firing squad.

2:03:24.907 --> 2:03:27.869
Five bullets, one blank. No one's guilty.

2:03:28.453 --> 2:03:30.580
Everybody in the power structure...

2:03:30.663 --> 2:03:32.540
...has a plausible deniability.

2:03:32.624 --> 2:03:36.252
No compromising connections
except at the most secret point.

2:03:37.670 --> 2:03:39.505
But it must succeed.

2:03:39.589 --> 2:03:42.300
No matter how many die
or how much it costs...

2:03:42.383 --> 2:03:45.178
...the perpetrators must be
on the winning side...

2:03:45.261 --> 2:03:49.098
...and never subject to prosecution
for anything by anyone.

2:03:49.599 --> 2:03:51.517
That is a coup d'état.

2:03:55.647 --> 2:03:58.524
Kennedy announces
the Texas trip in September.

2:03:58.608 --> 2:04:01.819
At that moment,
second Oswalds pop up all over Dallas...

2:04:02.278 --> 2:04:05.156
...where they have the mayor
and the cops in their pocket.

2:04:05.239 --> 2:04:07.408
General Y flies in the assassins.

2:04:07.533 --> 2:04:11.204
Maybe from the special camp
we keep near Athens, Greece.

2:04:11.371 --> 2:04:12.288
Pros.

2:04:12.538 --> 2:04:16.042
Maybe be locals, Cubans, Mafia hire.
Separate teams.

2:04:16.417 --> 2:04:18.211
Does it matter who shot...

2:04:18.836 --> 2:04:20.505
...from what rooftop?

2:04:21.839 --> 2:04:23.508
Part of the scenery.

2:04:24.092 --> 2:04:26.594
I keep thinking about that Tuesday...

2:04:26.844 --> 2:04:28.346
...the 26th of November.

2:04:28.429 --> 2:04:30.265
The day after they buried Kennedy.

2:04:30.348 --> 2:04:34.185
Gentlemen, I am not going
to let Vietnam go like China did.

2:04:34.978 --> 2:04:36.396
I'm committed...

2:04:36.521 --> 2:04:41.025
...not to take our soldiers out of there
till they know we mean business in Asia.

2:04:41.484 --> 2:04:44.821
Lyndon Johnson signs
National Security Memo 273...

2:04:44.988 --> 2:04:47.615
...which reverses
Kennedy's withdrawal policy...

2:04:47.699 --> 2:04:50.493
...and approves covert action
against North Vietnam...

2:04:50.576 --> 2:04:52.704
...provoking the Gulf of Tonkin incident.

2:04:52.787 --> 2:04:56.040
Just get me elected,
I'll give you the damn war.

2:04:57.834 --> 2:04:59.377
In that document...

2:05:00.628 --> 2:05:02.297
...lay the Vietnam War.

2:05:07.719 --> 2:05:11.514
I can't believe they killed him
because he wanted to change things.

2:05:12.724 --> 2:05:16.144
- In our time, in our country!
- They've done it throughout history.

2:05:16.227 --> 2:05:19.647
Kings are killed. Politics is power,
nothing more!

2:05:20.648 --> 2:05:23.901
Don't take my word for it.
Do your own thinking.

2:05:26.571 --> 2:05:28.156
The size of this is...

2:05:28.990 --> 2:05:30.325
...beyond me.

2:05:30.867 --> 2:05:32.160
Testify.

2:05:32.243 --> 2:05:33.745
- Me?
- Testify.

2:05:35.330 --> 2:05:36.915
No chance in hell.

2:05:37.665 --> 2:05:41.628
No, I'd be arrested and gagged.
Maybe sent to an institution.

2:05:42.170 --> 2:05:43.588
Maybe worse. You too.

2:05:44.339 --> 2:05:48.509
I can give you the background.
You find the foreground, the little things.

2:05:48.593 --> 2:05:52.263
Dig, you're the only one to bring a trial
in Kennedy's murder.

2:05:52.513 --> 2:05:54.849
That's important. It's historic.

2:05:55.516 --> 2:05:57.018
I haven't yet.

2:05:57.769 --> 2:06:00.021
I don't have much of a case.

2:06:01.105 --> 2:06:03.191
You don't have a choice anymore.

2:06:03.441 --> 2:06:07.111
You're a significant threat
to the national security structure.

2:06:07.528 --> 2:06:10.531
They'd have killed you already,
but there's light on you.

2:06:10.615 --> 2:06:12.784
So they'll destroy your credibility.

2:06:12.867 --> 2:06:15.036
They already have in many circles.

2:06:15.370 --> 2:06:16.621
Be honest.

2:06:16.955 --> 2:06:21.209
Your only chance is to come up
with a case. Something. Anything.

2:06:21.751 --> 2:06:24.295
Make arrests. Stir the shitstorm.

2:06:25.046 --> 2:06:26.714
Hope to start...

2:06:27.048 --> 2:06:29.717
...a chain reaction
of people coming forward.

2:06:29.801 --> 2:06:31.803
Then the government will crack.

2:06:31.886 --> 2:06:35.139
Fundamentally, people are suckers
for the truth.

2:06:35.306 --> 2:06:37.642
And the truth is on your side, bubba.

2:06:44.899 --> 2:06:46.484
I just hope you get a break.

2:07:31.904 --> 2:07:32.989
Mr. Shaw?

2:07:33.781 --> 2:07:36.159
You are under arrest for conspiracy...

2:07:36.451 --> 2:07:40.788
...and entering into agreement with others
for the purpose of murdering...

2:07:40.955 --> 2:07:42.707
...President John F. Kennedy.

2:07:42.790 --> 2:07:45.335
We have a warrant to search the premises.

2:07:45.793 --> 2:07:47.754
It's my duty to inform you...

2:07:48.379 --> 2:07:50.965
...you have the right to remain silent.

2:07:51.132 --> 2:07:52.300
Name?

2:07:52.717 --> 2:07:54.385
Clay LaVerne Shaw.

2:07:56.804 --> 2:07:57.889
Address?

2:07:58.056 --> 2:08:00.600
1313 Dauphine Street, New Orleans.

2:08:02.310 --> 2:08:04.187
Ever use any aliases?

2:08:04.479 --> 2:08:06.022
Clay Bertrand.

2:08:12.320 --> 2:08:16.574
Mr. Clark, are you aware of the charges
filed by District Attorney Garrison?

2:08:16.658 --> 2:08:19.786
Yes, Mr. Shaw was included
in our investigation.

2:08:20.286 --> 2:08:22.664
No connection was found at all.

2:08:23.289 --> 2:08:26.834
If the FBI did investigate him,
why is his name not mentioned...

2:08:26.918 --> 2:08:29.712
...in the entire 26 volumes
of the Warren Report...

2:08:29.796 --> 2:08:32.131
...even if it is to clear his name?

2:08:32.674 --> 2:08:36.427
I doubt this Attorney General
would qualify for my staff.

2:08:36.636 --> 2:08:40.306
Mr. Garrison has presented
absolutely nothing publicly...

2:08:40.932 --> 2:08:43.351
...which would contradict our findings.

2:08:44.102 --> 2:08:47.272
I know of no fact which would refute...

2:08:47.939 --> 2:08:50.108
...the Commission's conclusion...

2:08:50.275 --> 2:08:53.069
...that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.

2:08:55.571 --> 2:08:59.200
I congratulate Mr. Shaw.
Most defendants must wait for trial...

2:08:59.284 --> 2:09:02.996
...before they produce sacred cows
like a Chief Justice...

2:09:03.371 --> 2:09:04.831
...as a character witness...

2:09:04.914 --> 2:09:08.251
...who is not under oath
and therefore free from perjury.

2:09:08.626 --> 2:09:10.795
Even if it's partly true...

2:09:11.129 --> 2:09:15.133
...you realize you're damaging
the credibility of the country?

2:09:15.925 --> 2:09:19.804
Is a government worth preserving
when it lies to the people?

2:09:20.930 --> 2:09:22.890
It's become a dangerous country...

2:09:22.974 --> 2:09:26.603
...when you cannot trust anyone.
When you cannot tell the truth.

2:09:27.979 --> 2:09:31.190
I say let justice be done,
though the heavens fall!

2:09:37.447 --> 2:09:40.533
The JFK Conspiracy:
The Case of Jim Garrison.

2:09:41.326 --> 2:09:45.079
- Honey, this is about you.
- After an investigation in New Orleans...

2:09:45.163 --> 2:09:46.873
...reporters have learned...

2:09:46.956 --> 2:09:50.168
...that District Attorney Jim Garrison
and his staff...

2:09:50.335 --> 2:09:54.047
...have intimidated,
bribed and even drugged witnesses...

2:09:54.130 --> 2:09:59.010
...to attempt to prove a conspiracy
involving businessman Clay Shaw...

2:09:59.636 --> 2:10:01.888
...in the murder of John F. Kennedy.

2:10:02.472 --> 2:10:06.309
John Chancler was a cellmate
of Willie O'Keefe's at Angola.

2:10:07.018 --> 2:10:10.480
He said he'd be cut loose
if he copped to the DA's office.

2:10:10.647 --> 2:10:12.565
I sent him up for burglary.

2:10:13.858 --> 2:10:16.361
And there's his old buddy Miguel Torres.

2:10:16.653 --> 2:10:18.196
We sent him up too.

2:10:18.363 --> 2:10:22.492
They wanted me to say Shaw
was Bertrand. They'd get me a pardon.

2:10:22.825 --> 2:10:25.828
Janet Williams comments
on Willie O'Keefe's...

2:10:26.037 --> 2:10:28.539
...descriptions of having met Oswald.

2:10:28.706 --> 2:10:30.333
Was he a homosexual?

2:10:30.500 --> 2:10:32.752
Not the Lee I knew. Absolutely not.

2:10:33.336 --> 2:10:36.881
Mr. O'Keefe must have seen someone
he thought was Lee Oswald.

2:10:37.048 --> 2:10:40.718
I didn't talk to nobody.
I was on drugs at the hospital.

2:10:41.344 --> 2:10:45.098
I told the FBI that call was a figment
of my imagination.

2:10:45.348 --> 2:10:47.517
I think he's quite ill, mentally.

2:10:47.684 --> 2:10:51.396
With one half of his mind,
he is able to fabricate evidence...

2:10:52.397 --> 2:10:56.734
...then he convinces the other half
that the fabrication is the truth.

2:10:57.151 --> 2:11:01.447
Don't worry. There's only 20
or 30 million people watching this tonight.

2:11:03.700 --> 2:11:06.661
My reputation's all right
with the people watching Laugh In.

2:11:06.744 --> 2:11:09.664
Has he ignored the Mafia connections
to this conspiracy...

2:11:09.747 --> 2:11:12.834
...because he's indebted to the mob?

2:11:13.376 --> 2:11:16.838
The more one looks at Jim Garrison,
the more one finds...

2:11:17.005 --> 2:11:21.968
...he has destroyed reputations, spread fear
and suspicion, and worst of all...

2:11:22.302 --> 2:11:25.346
...exploited this nation's sorrow and doubt.

2:11:25.597 --> 2:11:27.515
Jim Garrison has said:

2:11:28.433 --> 2:11:31.603
"Let justice be done,
though the heavens fall. "

2:11:32.061 --> 2:11:34.397
He seeks the truth. So do we.

2:11:46.618 --> 2:11:50.371
Dr. Martin Luther King's beautiful dream
expressed so dramatically...

2:11:50.455 --> 2:11:53.124
...during the 1963 march on Washington...

2:11:53.207 --> 2:11:56.711
...was shattered tonight in Memphis,
Tennessee by an assassin's bullet.

2:11:56.794 --> 2:12:00.006
Police think the single shot came
from across the street.

2:12:00.089 --> 2:12:04.552
They found a Browning automatic rifle,
fitted with a marksman's scope.

2:12:05.803 --> 2:12:07.263
I'll get it.

2:12:09.933 --> 2:12:12.727
Hello, is this Jim Garrison's daughter?

2:12:13.603 --> 2:12:15.521
Virginia or Elizabeth?

2:12:16.940 --> 2:12:19.317
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl.

2:12:19.484 --> 2:12:23.655
Your daddy's entered you
in a beauty contest. Like to be in one?

2:12:24.656 --> 2:12:25.949
I don't know.

2:12:26.032 --> 2:12:28.368
My God! What have they done?

2:12:29.577 --> 2:12:31.120
It's lynching time.

2:12:33.957 --> 2:12:35.458
That sounds fun.

2:12:36.167 --> 2:12:38.336
You get out of school at 3:00?

2:12:38.503 --> 2:12:40.088
Who are you talking to?

2:12:40.171 --> 2:12:42.006
That's all I need to know.

2:12:42.090 --> 2:12:45.051
Mommy, I'm going to be
in a beauty contest.

2:12:45.301 --> 2:12:47.428
Who is this? Who is this?

2:12:49.889 --> 2:12:52.600
Did you enter Virginia in a beauty contest?

2:12:52.850 --> 2:12:55.603
A man called and asked her height,
her weight-

2:12:55.687 --> 2:12:58.773
Some crackpot.
Martin Luther King was killed.

2:12:58.982 --> 2:13:00.608
Her life's been threatened!

2:13:00.692 --> 2:13:03.820
A crank making calls.
Happens a dozen times a day at the office.

2:13:03.903 --> 2:13:06.489
Our home! A kidnapper, a murderer!

2:13:06.948 --> 2:13:08.700
Only cowards make crank calls.

2:13:08.992 --> 2:13:10.535
Nothing will happen.

2:13:10.702 --> 2:13:15.206
You don't know what goes on here
anymore! You're busy making speeches!

2:13:15.540 --> 2:13:18.334
Getting every crazed Klansman after us!

2:13:18.543 --> 2:13:22.964
I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!
I can't stand it anymore!

2:13:23.047 --> 2:13:25.925
- The government wants us scared.
- You and your government!

2:13:26.009 --> 2:13:29.721
They want everybody too scared
to speak out. They count on it.

2:13:29.887 --> 2:13:32.890
- There's nothing to fear!
- Don't you have feelings?

2:13:34.726 --> 2:13:36.477
Your own daughter!

2:13:36.894 --> 2:13:39.022
What kind of a man are you?

2:13:42.400 --> 2:13:46.404
I'll take them to my mother's.
You spend a week.

2:13:46.696 --> 2:13:49.490
I'll change the locks, the phones.
I'll get a bodyguard.

2:13:49.574 --> 2:13:51.576
Get a hold of yourself!

2:13:51.909 --> 2:13:55.538
Before this Kennedy thing,
your children mattered most.

2:13:55.914 --> 2:13:58.875
The other night you didn't
even notice Jasper.

2:13:59.000 --> 2:14:01.169
He came to me bawling his eyes out.

2:14:01.252 --> 2:14:04.172
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.

2:14:04.547 --> 2:14:06.299
Is it such a chore?

2:14:06.382 --> 2:14:10.345
Goddamn it! If I said I'll spend
more time with him, I will!

2:14:10.887 --> 2:14:13.139
I cannot fight you and the whole world too!

2:14:13.222 --> 2:14:16.017
I'm not fighting you!
I'm trying to reach you.

2:14:16.434 --> 2:14:19.270
- You've changed.
- Of course I've changed!

2:14:20.021 --> 2:14:21.648
My eyes have opened.

2:14:22.106 --> 2:14:24.943
And what once looked normal
seems insane.

2:14:25.026 --> 2:14:28.696
And now King. Don't you think
this has something to do with that?

2:14:28.780 --> 2:14:29.864
Can't you see?

2:14:29.989 --> 2:14:33.910
I don't want to see, goddamn it!
I'm tired. I've had enough!

2:14:34.452 --> 2:14:38.456
You're ruining this man Shaw's life
because he's a homosexual.

2:14:38.581 --> 2:14:40.124
That's not why!

2:14:40.541 --> 2:14:43.711
Did you ever once stop
to consider his feelings?

2:14:46.130 --> 2:14:47.757
You don't believe me?

2:14:48.091 --> 2:14:50.802
- I don't know!
- You never believed me?

2:14:51.970 --> 2:14:55.723
I just want to raise our children
and live a normal life.

2:14:55.848 --> 2:14:57.684
I want my life back!

2:14:58.768 --> 2:15:00.603
So do I, goddamn it!

2:15:01.187 --> 2:15:03.231
I had a life too, you know!

2:15:03.606 --> 2:15:07.360
You can't bury your head in the sand
like an ostrich, Liz!

2:15:07.652 --> 2:15:12.115
It's not about our well-being, our two cars,
our TVs and your kitchen!

2:15:14.117 --> 2:15:17.370
It's about our kids growing up
in a shithole of lies. I'm angry!

2:15:17.453 --> 2:15:19.581
My life is fucked because of it.

2:15:19.872 --> 2:15:23.042
If you could see it that way,
you'd see your life is fucked too.

2:15:23.126 --> 2:15:24.877
You never talked to me this way.

2:15:24.961 --> 2:15:27.088
If you don't want to support me, fine.

2:15:27.171 --> 2:15:30.091
But don't make threats
about taking the children.

2:15:30.174 --> 2:15:31.634
I'm leaving you!

2:15:31.843 --> 2:15:34.387
- I'm taking the children!
- Go on! Get out!

2:15:34.470 --> 2:15:35.972
- I am!
- Go hide!

2:15:36.139 --> 2:15:38.349
Join the rest! They'll say I'm crazy.

2:15:38.474 --> 2:15:41.019
Plenty of people will tell you I'm crazy.

2:15:42.729 --> 2:15:46.065
You won't have any problems
filling out divorce papers.

2:15:47.191 --> 2:15:49.652
But somebody's got to try, goddamn it!

2:15:49.986 --> 2:15:51.321
Somebody!

2:15:55.533 --> 2:15:57.577
Are we going away, Daddy?

2:16:05.001 --> 2:16:06.711
I don't know, Jasper.

2:16:07.545 --> 2:16:08.796
Because of Kennedy?

2:16:09.672 --> 2:16:12.216
Will the same people kill us, Papa?

2:16:15.011 --> 2:16:16.804
Nobody will kill us.

2:16:17.513 --> 2:16:18.598
I'm scared.

2:16:19.891 --> 2:16:22.810
I don't like it when you and Mommy fight.

2:16:25.688 --> 2:16:27.649
I don't like it either, honey.

2:16:28.733 --> 2:16:30.777
Why do we have to leave?

2:16:31.569 --> 2:16:33.696
Don't you love us anymore?

2:16:36.532 --> 2:16:38.409
Daddy loves you both.

2:16:40.078 --> 2:16:43.414
There's nothing wrong
with feeling a little scared, Jasper.

2:16:43.706 --> 2:16:46.876
Telling the truth can be
a scary thing sometimes.

2:16:47.877 --> 2:16:50.880
It scared President Kennedy,
and he was a brave man.

2:16:51.881 --> 2:16:54.550
But if you let yourself be too scared...

2:16:54.759 --> 2:16:57.845
...then you let the bad guys
take over the country.

2:16:59.472 --> 2:17:01.266
Then everybody gets scared.

2:17:02.392 --> 2:17:04.102
Stay with Mom, Papa.

2:17:04.227 --> 2:17:05.436
Please.

2:17:13.152 --> 2:17:14.404
Here's another.

2:17:14.612 --> 2:17:17.949
The US Attorney in Washington declines
to serve our subpoena...

2:17:18.074 --> 2:17:22.453
...on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell,
CIA Director Richard Helms, any FBI agent.

2:17:22.579 --> 2:17:25.248
What'd you expect from a pig but a grunt?

2:17:25.456 --> 2:17:29.752
Now it'll be near impossible
to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.

2:17:29.919 --> 2:17:31.296
What's going on?

2:17:31.462 --> 2:17:34.716
We've never been refused
an extradition request.

2:17:34.966 --> 2:17:37.010
Let's get Julia Ann Mercer in here.

2:17:37.135 --> 2:17:38.928
No, she could get hurt.

2:17:39.387 --> 2:17:41.681
Look what's happening to other people.

2:17:41.806 --> 2:17:43.850
She's the best witness we have.

2:17:43.975 --> 2:17:47.061
I just don't want to do it. Now, what else?

2:17:48.187 --> 2:17:51.608
You got your hate mail here.
And your fan mail here.

2:17:52.859 --> 2:17:57.488
The bad news is that the IRS requested
an audit of your income from this office.

2:17:58.448 --> 2:18:02.243
I expected that two months ago.
They're wasting their time.

2:18:05.121 --> 2:18:09.250
The bad news is the National Guard
just asked me to resign after 18 years.

2:18:10.501 --> 2:18:14.130
Maybe that's the good news.
Never was as good as combat.

2:18:15.340 --> 2:18:16.341
But this is.

2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:19.594
Any more on Oswald or Shaw?

2:18:21.554 --> 2:18:24.641
They were seen together in Clinton
in early September.

2:18:24.933 --> 2:18:28.686
The Civil Rights Movement
was running a voter's registration drive.

2:18:29.145 --> 2:18:32.398
Rumor is, Shaw was working
on some arms deal...

2:18:32.565 --> 2:18:35.109
...to discredit the Civil Rights Movement.

2:18:35.443 --> 2:18:38.529
Nobody really knows
what they were doing there, but...

2:18:38.655 --> 2:18:40.782
...hell, they stood out like cotton balls.

2:18:40.907 --> 2:18:43.576
I got whites and coloreds
that saw them there.

2:18:43.701 --> 2:18:47.121
Last time I checked,
it was not illegal to register to vote.

2:18:48.081 --> 2:18:49.749
We still got the...

2:18:50.124 --> 2:18:54.587
...the junkie, Vernon Bundy,
who saw him talking at the sea wall.

2:18:55.255 --> 2:18:57.966
This is tough.
No one wants to talk about Shaw.

2:18:58.341 --> 2:18:59.884
You keep saying that.

2:19:00.176 --> 2:19:02.679
- I keep saying what?
- You're not digging deep enough.

2:19:02.804 --> 2:19:05.682
You want to do my job!
You do my job, I'll do your job.

2:19:05.807 --> 2:19:08.226
I think Clinton is a breakthrough now.

2:19:09.894 --> 2:19:12.272
Shaw denies ever knowing Oswald, right?

2:19:13.481 --> 2:19:15.149
That proves he's a liar.

2:19:17.151 --> 2:19:18.903
- Keep on it, Bill.
- This is the interesting part.

2:19:19.654 --> 2:19:21.864
Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks...

2:19:21.990 --> 2:19:23.741
...before the assassination.

2:19:23.825 --> 2:19:25.702
May I see Special Agent Hosty?

2:19:25.827 --> 2:19:27.912
He's not in. Can someone else help you?

2:19:27.996 --> 2:19:31.874
Special Agent Hosty made three visits
to Janet Williams' house...

2:19:32.125 --> 2:19:34.836
...to keep an eye on Marina. He left a note.

2:19:34.919 --> 2:19:37.839
Hosty told a newspaperman
it was a warning...

2:19:38.172 --> 2:19:41.634
...to stop questioning Marina
when Oswald was not present.

2:19:41.759 --> 2:19:46.389
She was not a citizen, so possibly
he was threatening to deport her to Russia.

2:19:47.223 --> 2:19:49.475
But what the note really said,
no one knows.

2:19:49.934 --> 2:19:52.562
Hosty tore it up
and flushed it down the toilet.

2:19:52.645 --> 2:19:54.355
This is just speculation.

2:19:54.647 --> 2:19:58.443
But what if the note described
the assassination attempt on JFK?

2:20:04.782 --> 2:20:06.367
Come on, think!

2:20:06.784 --> 2:20:09.120
That's the only reason to destroy it.

2:20:09.454 --> 2:20:13.374
If it was a threat like Hosty said,
they would have kept it.

2:20:13.833 --> 2:20:17.629
It makes their case against the angry,
lone nut that much stronger.

2:20:18.171 --> 2:20:20.340
Remember the meeting
with Agent Quigley...

2:20:20.423 --> 2:20:21.925
...the day he was arrested?

2:20:22.008 --> 2:20:24.844
Quigley destroyed the notes
from the interview.

2:20:25.136 --> 2:20:29.098
We can raise the possibility
that Oswald was not only an informant...

2:20:29.766 --> 2:20:34.646
...but he may have been the original source
for the telex dated November 17...

2:20:35.146 --> 2:20:39.233
...warning of Kennedy's assassination
in Dallas on November 22.

2:20:41.653 --> 2:20:45.740
William Walter, the FBI night clerk,
gave me a copy.

2:20:46.157 --> 2:20:48.910
It went all over the country.
Nothing was done.

2:20:48.993 --> 2:20:52.789
The motorcade went ahead on schedule.
The Warren Report didn't mention it.

2:20:52.872 --> 2:20:56.834
"A militant group may attempt
to assassinate President Kennedy...

2:20:56.918 --> 2:20:58.962
"... on his proposed trip
to Dallas, Texas. "

2:20:59.379 --> 2:21:01.130
Shortly after the assassination...

2:21:01.214 --> 2:21:05.301
...Walter says the telex was removed
from all the files...

2:21:05.551 --> 2:21:08.221
...as an obvious embarrassment
to the Bureau.

2:21:09.514 --> 2:21:11.933
I believe Oswald sent information
through Hosty.

2:21:12.475 --> 2:21:16.104
I have a hunch Oswald
had infiltrated this group:

2:21:16.354 --> 2:21:18.648
Cubans or right-wing extremists.

2:21:19.315 --> 2:21:22.777
He was told to be
at the Book Depository that day...

2:21:23.152 --> 2:21:26.072
...to either prevent the assassination
or take part in it.

2:21:26.656 --> 2:21:30.159
Either they told him
they'd close down the plotters...

2:21:31.160 --> 2:21:32.620
...or simulate an attack...

2:21:32.704 --> 2:21:35.081
...on Kennedy to whip up public opinion...

2:21:35.164 --> 2:21:38.376
...so Kennedy would have to reverse
his policies on communism.

2:21:39.168 --> 2:21:41.337
What they told him doesn't matter.

2:21:41.879 --> 2:21:43.381
He was under orders.

2:21:43.464 --> 2:21:45.300
He was a foot soldier.

2:21:47.885 --> 2:21:50.722
You can't miss. He is a dead duck.

2:21:51.889 --> 2:21:53.182
I don't buy it.

2:21:53.558 --> 2:21:55.560
Why would the FBI cover it up?

2:21:55.852 --> 2:21:59.606
A telex disappears from every FBI office
in this country?

2:22:00.189 --> 2:22:01.733
There's a word, Bill.

2:22:01.899 --> 2:22:03.901
- Orders.
- Or a cover-up.

2:22:04.944 --> 2:22:07.989
Don't you have enough proof
of the FBl's complicity yet?

2:22:08.072 --> 2:22:10.408
I respect this country's institutions!

2:22:12.660 --> 2:22:16.039
How the hell can you keep
a conspiracy going...

2:22:16.247 --> 2:22:21.002
...between the mob, CIA, FBl, Army
intelligence and who knows what else...

2:22:21.210 --> 2:22:25.089
...when you can't keep a secret
in this room between 12 people?

2:22:25.256 --> 2:22:27.300
I mean, we got leaks everywhere.

2:22:27.383 --> 2:22:29.677
We are going to trial, y'all!

2:22:30.261 --> 2:22:32.430
What the hell do we really got?

2:22:32.597 --> 2:22:35.558
Oswald, Ruby, Banister,
and Ferrie are dead.

2:22:36.267 --> 2:22:39.020
Maybe Shaw is an agent. I don't know.

2:22:39.228 --> 2:22:40.855
But as a covert operator...

2:22:40.939 --> 2:22:44.484
...he is wide open for blackmail
because of his homosexuality.

2:22:44.567 --> 2:22:48.446
Shaw's our toehold.
I don't know or care exactly how he fits.

2:22:48.947 --> 2:22:52.116
But he's lying through his teeth.
I won't let go of him.

2:22:52.283 --> 2:22:55.036
That's why you're going to trial
against Clay Shaw?

2:22:55.119 --> 2:22:56.663
You will lose!

2:22:56.955 --> 2:22:59.749
We should investigate
our Mafia leads here.

2:22:59.916 --> 2:23:03.127
I can buy that easier
than I can the government.

2:23:04.295 --> 2:23:07.840
Ruby is all mob, knows Oswald,
sets him up.

2:23:08.591 --> 2:23:12.595
Hoffa, Trafficante, Marcello,
they hire some guns and do Kennedy.

2:23:12.929 --> 2:23:16.391
The government doesn't want
to open up a whole can of worms...

2:23:16.474 --> 2:23:19.477
...because it used the mob
to try to get Castro.

2:23:20.144 --> 2:23:23.606
Castro being assassinated
by the mob by us...

2:23:23.815 --> 2:23:25.817
...sounds wild to John Q. Citizen.

2:23:25.900 --> 2:23:28.361
So they close the book on JFK.

2:23:29.946 --> 2:23:31.447
Makes perfect sense to me.

2:23:31.531 --> 2:23:34.534
I don't doubt their involvement
at a low level.

2:23:35.326 --> 2:23:37.704
Could the mob change the parade route?

2:23:37.996 --> 2:23:40.790
Or eliminate the protection
for the President?

2:23:41.082 --> 2:23:44.252
Could the mob send Oswald to Russia
and get him back?

2:23:44.669 --> 2:23:49.257
Get the FBl, the CIA and the Dallas Police
to mess up the investigation?

2:23:49.465 --> 2:23:52.802
Get the Warren Commission appointed
to cover it up?

2:23:53.303 --> 2:23:57.557
Wreck the autopsy? Influence
the national media to go to sleep?

2:23:57.890 --> 2:24:01.394
Since when has the mob used anything
but. 38's for hits up close?

2:24:03.187 --> 2:24:07.442
The mob wouldn't have the guts or
the power for something of this magnitude.

2:24:07.650 --> 2:24:09.694
Assassins need payrolls...

2:24:10.194 --> 2:24:12.280
...schedules, times, orders.

2:24:13.197 --> 2:24:15.700
This was a military-style ambush.

2:24:16.034 --> 2:24:19.537
A coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson
waiting in the wings.

2:24:19.829 --> 2:24:23.625
You're saying Lyndon Johnson
was involved? The President?

2:24:24.167 --> 2:24:27.545
Johnson got $1 billion for his friends,
Brown and Root...

2:24:27.712 --> 2:24:30.173
...to dredge Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.

2:24:30.340 --> 2:24:33.509
Boss, are you calling the President
a murderer?

2:24:33.676 --> 2:24:37.221
If I'm so far from the truth,
why is the FBI bugging our offices?

2:24:37.305 --> 2:24:40.099
Why are witnesses being bought off
and murdered?

2:24:40.391 --> 2:24:44.020
Why are federal agencies blocking
our extraditions and subpoenas?

2:24:44.187 --> 2:24:45.688
I don't know.

2:24:46.022 --> 2:24:49.025
Maybe there's some rogue element
in the government.

2:24:49.192 --> 2:24:51.361
With a full-blown cover-up?

2:24:52.737 --> 2:24:54.739
You ever read Shakespeare?

2:24:57.367 --> 2:24:58.534
I do.

2:24:59.202 --> 2:25:00.745
Julius Caesar?

2:25:01.537 --> 2:25:04.832
"Brutus and Cassius,
they too are honorable men. "

2:25:05.583 --> 2:25:07.252
Who killed Caesar?

2:25:08.044 --> 2:25:10.046
Ten or twelve Senators.

2:25:10.255 --> 2:25:12.382
All it takes is one Judas.

2:25:13.091 --> 2:25:16.094
A few people on the inside. Pentagon, CIA.

2:25:16.427 --> 2:25:18.179
This is Louisiana.

2:25:18.763 --> 2:25:23.184
How do you know who your daddy is?
'Cause your mama told you so.

2:25:24.102 --> 2:25:26.437
You are taking a crap in the wind.

2:25:26.813 --> 2:25:29.816
And I am not going along on this one.

2:25:39.909 --> 2:25:42.745
I've had my doubts all along about Bill.

2:25:43.288 --> 2:25:45.206
He's been fighting us.

2:25:46.541 --> 2:25:47.917
We need him back.

2:25:48.293 --> 2:25:50.587
He wasted a month trying to prove...

2:25:50.753 --> 2:25:54.424
...that mob boys like Jack Ruby
are hooked up with Hunt Oil.

2:25:54.591 --> 2:25:56.884
- I don't trust him.
- I will not hear this.

2:25:56.968 --> 2:25:59.846
I value Bill as much as any person here.

2:26:01.139 --> 2:26:05.143
It's time we made room
for someone else's ideas, including me.

2:26:06.436 --> 2:26:09.439
Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is,
and I'm...

2:26:09.981 --> 2:26:11.899
...just plain dumb about it.

2:26:11.983 --> 2:26:14.736
I've seen him copying files here
late at night.

2:26:14.819 --> 2:26:17.488
- I don't trust him.
- Did you two hear me?

2:26:17.655 --> 2:26:19.991
I won't tolerate staff infighting.

2:26:20.158 --> 2:26:23.494
I'm afraid I cannot work
with Bill Broussard anymore.

2:26:24.787 --> 2:26:26.456
Is this an ultimatum?

2:26:28.124 --> 2:26:29.834
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

2:26:29.918 --> 2:26:32.128
If that's what you want to call it.

2:26:34.339 --> 2:26:36.507
I never thought it'd come to this.

2:26:40.136 --> 2:26:41.387
I guess I am.

2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:47.268
I won't have any ultimatum put to me, Lou.
I'll accept your resignation.

2:26:51.481 --> 2:26:53.024
You sure got it.

2:26:58.363 --> 2:27:00.990
You are one stubborn son of a bitch.

2:27:03.326 --> 2:27:05.245
You're making a big mistake.

2:27:12.627 --> 2:27:15.338
Boss, aren't you being a little hard?

2:27:16.589 --> 2:27:18.341
No, I don't think I am.

2:27:19.926 --> 2:27:21.135
Anyone else?

2:27:26.224 --> 2:27:29.018
Now, Jerry, here's Jim Garrison...

2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:32.605
...the District Attorney
of New Orleans, Louisiana.

2:27:47.287 --> 2:27:49.539
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.

2:27:50.373 --> 2:27:53.751
You're investigating the murder
of President Kennedy.

2:27:54.294 --> 2:27:57.755
We have heard some strange things
coming out of your office.

2:27:58.506 --> 2:28:02.218
First, we heard that Cuban exiles
killed the President.

2:28:02.302 --> 2:28:03.761
Then the mob...

2:28:04.470 --> 2:28:09.566
Your latest theory seems to be
that the CIA and the FBl...

2:28:09.650 --> 2:28:10.767
...and the Pentagon...

2:28:10.768 --> 2:28:15.940
...and the White House all combined
in an elaborate conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

2:28:17.633 --> 2:28:19.844
Is there anyone
besides Lee Harvey Oswald...

2:28:19.969 --> 2:28:23.139
...who you think didn't conspire
to kill the President?

2:28:25.766 --> 2:28:27.727
Let's just say this, Jerry...

2:28:28.436 --> 2:28:29.979
...I've stopped beating my wife.

2:28:32.231 --> 2:28:35.484
Maybe you should ask Lyndon Johnson.
He has some answers.

2:28:39.739 --> 2:28:42.908
There have been a number of reports
in reputable news media...

2:28:43.034 --> 2:28:45.369
...Time, Newsweek, our own NBC...

2:28:45.911 --> 2:28:49.832
...that you've gone beyond legal means
as a prosecutor...

2:28:50.791 --> 2:28:53.794
...that you've intimidated,
even drugged witnesses...

2:28:53.878 --> 2:28:56.964
...bribed them, and urged them
to commit perjury.

2:28:57.423 --> 2:28:58.883
Do you have a response?

2:28:58.966 --> 2:29:02.261
Your faith in the veracity
of the major media is touching.

2:29:02.511 --> 2:29:05.473
It indicates that the age of innocence
is not yet over.

2:29:05.598 --> 2:29:07.058
But ask yourself...

2:29:07.183 --> 2:29:09.852
...if we had learned
on November 22, 1963...

2:29:09.977 --> 2:29:13.356
...that the Russian Premier had been shot
from a Moscow building...

2:29:13.481 --> 2:29:15.399
...by a lonely capitalist sympathizer...

2:29:15.524 --> 2:29:19.779
...who, himself, was then liquidated
by a patriotic Muscovite within 48 hours...

2:29:19.904 --> 2:29:21.656
...while surrounded by armed police.

2:29:21.739 --> 2:29:24.200
I think it would be apparent to anyone...

2:29:24.325 --> 2:29:28.579
...that a coup d'etat and a transfer
of power had just taken place.

2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:32.917
And we would not ask questions
or attack Jim Garrison.

2:29:33.167 --> 2:29:35.461
We would, in a free-thinking society...

2:29:35.586 --> 2:29:39.715
...be asking why he was killed,
and what forces opposed him.

2:29:40.424 --> 2:29:43.719
There are some people who might say
that you are paranoid.

2:29:43.928 --> 2:29:47.181
I should show you some pictures
so you can understand...

2:29:47.723 --> 2:29:49.517
...what I'm talking about.

2:29:50.685 --> 2:29:52.269
These are arrests.

2:29:52.603 --> 2:29:56.190
These arrests were photographed
minutes after the assassination.

2:29:56.273 --> 2:29:58.567
They were never shown to the public.

2:29:58.651 --> 2:30:00.945
I'm sorry,
these pictures can't be shown on TV.

2:30:01.028 --> 2:30:03.572
- Sure they can.
- No, I'm sorry. They can't.

2:30:03.990 --> 2:30:06.742
- The camera can pick these up.
- Jim, I'm sorry.

2:30:06.993 --> 2:30:09.704
They can't. We have libel laws.

2:30:09.954 --> 2:30:13.916
Those men you just saw were arrested
in Dallas minutes after the assassination.

2:30:14.000 --> 2:30:15.751
They were never seen again.

2:30:15.835 --> 2:30:18.921
No record of arrest,
no mug shots, no fingerprints.

2:30:19.213 --> 2:30:20.464
Hold that thought.

2:30:20.548 --> 2:30:23.342
We'll be back,
right after these commercials.

2:30:34.520 --> 2:30:36.731
Bill, what the hell are you doing here?

2:30:36.814 --> 2:30:40.985
I'm sorry about the other day.
I didn't mean to walk out on you like that.

2:30:41.944 --> 2:30:44.613
You came all this way
to tell me the obvious?

2:30:44.989 --> 2:30:46.198
No. Look...

2:30:46.615 --> 2:30:50.619
...I just heard of an attempt to kill you
between here and New Orleans.

2:30:51.329 --> 2:30:54.665
A mob guy was brought down by Shaw
from Canada.

2:30:54.957 --> 2:30:58.085
This is serious.
You'll need a bodyguard tonight.

2:30:58.753 --> 2:31:02.673
When you were in the Army,
did you ever find out what an order meant?

2:31:02.882 --> 2:31:06.052
Do you remember my orders
about passing on rumors...

2:31:06.135 --> 2:31:08.346
...about someone going to be killed?

2:31:08.429 --> 2:31:11.182
- Yes, I do, but this is-
- No, there is no "but. "

2:31:11.265 --> 2:31:13.934
There is no "but" in a military situation!

2:31:14.560 --> 2:31:17.688
I don't appreciate you dumping
this paranoid garbage on me...

2:31:17.772 --> 2:31:20.191
...nor your inability
to follow a simple order...

2:31:20.274 --> 2:31:24.654
...especially when it means I have to pay
for your flight back to New Orleans.

2:31:25.446 --> 2:31:27.156
Let's get you a ticket.

2:31:28.616 --> 2:31:31.327
Boss, I'm sorry.
I'm just looking out for you.

2:31:32.161 --> 2:31:33.621
Get a receipt.

2:32:20.960 --> 2:32:22.670
Come on, come on. He's out here.

2:32:22.753 --> 2:32:25.965
Jim, where are you going?
It's me, Samuel.

2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:38.728
- Hey, how long were you in that restroom?
- None of your goddamn business.

2:33:27.943 --> 2:33:30.488
Jim, bad news, Bill's turned.

2:33:30.613 --> 2:33:33.324
I think he's given everything we've got
to the feds.

2:33:33.407 --> 2:33:36.702
We studied the memos
and there was nothing there. Nothing.

2:33:36.786 --> 2:33:40.456
We went to confront him and the landlady
said the son of a bitch just left.

2:33:40.539 --> 2:33:41.916
Left everything.

2:33:42.458 --> 2:33:44.210
It's unbelievable. I'm sorry.

2:33:44.293 --> 2:33:47.213
Mattie, could you get Mr. Garrison
a drink, please?

2:33:47.463 --> 2:33:49.256
Something sure scared him.

2:33:49.340 --> 2:33:52.301
Bill doesn't scare that easy.
Somebody got to his thinking.

2:33:52.385 --> 2:33:55.513
- He was never that good a thinker.
- He sure fooled us.

2:33:56.597 --> 2:34:00.017
No, no, leave it. Don't turn it down.
I want to see this.

2:34:01.143 --> 2:34:03.562
You know what's happening, he's winning.

2:34:05.856 --> 2:34:07.817
He'll never make it.

2:34:08.567 --> 2:34:12.238
If he wins, they'll kill him.
He'll stop the war.

2:34:13.990 --> 2:34:16.909
They'll kill him
before they let him be President.

2:34:22.248 --> 2:34:24.750
With Broussard, they have everything...

2:34:24.834 --> 2:34:27.503
...all our witnesses,
our strategies for the trial.

2:34:27.586 --> 2:34:29.338
We got to double check his work.

2:34:29.422 --> 2:34:32.299
There could be false leads.
We can't go to trial!

2:34:32.466 --> 2:34:33.843
We don't have a prayer!

2:34:33.926 --> 2:34:37.054
- I don't think so, Al.
- I have to agree with Al, Boss.

2:34:37.638 --> 2:34:40.099
This is not one we'll come out on.

2:34:40.182 --> 2:34:43.519
You remember the Hemingway story,
The Old Man and the Sea?

2:34:44.395 --> 2:34:47.481
The old fisherman manages
to catch this great fish...

2:34:48.024 --> 2:34:52.028
...a fish so huge, that he has to tie it
to the boat to get it back in.

2:34:52.361 --> 2:34:54.155
By the time it reached shore...

2:34:54.238 --> 2:34:57.408
...the fish had long since been picked apart
by sharks.

2:35:01.037 --> 2:35:02.830
Nothing was left, but the skeleton.

2:35:02.913 --> 2:35:06.876
- And that's what will happen to us.
- Then what did we do this for?

2:35:06.959 --> 2:35:08.627
It's a means to an end.

2:35:09.128 --> 2:35:11.088
This war has two fronts.

2:35:12.506 --> 2:35:16.719
In a court of law,
we hope to get Clay Shaw for conspiracy.

2:35:16.886 --> 2:35:20.806
In the court of public opinion,
it could take another 25, 30 years...

2:35:21.015 --> 2:35:22.975
...for the truth to come out.

2:35:25.061 --> 2:35:27.647
At least we'll strike the first blow.

2:35:29.231 --> 2:35:30.775
What if you're wrong?

2:35:34.862 --> 2:35:37.490
I never thought for a second I was.

2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:43.287
Will you come to the trial?

2:35:44.830 --> 2:35:45.623
I don't think so.

2:35:47.833 --> 2:35:53.339
With 53% of the precincts reporting,
Sen. Kennedy has a 48% to 41% lead...

2:35:53.422 --> 2:35:55.007
...over Sen. McCarthy.

2:35:55.132 --> 2:35:57.718
CBS News projects Sen. Robert Kennedy...

2:35:57.802 --> 2:36:00.262
...the winner of the California primary.

2:36:00.471 --> 2:36:04.684
Within the United States over the period
of the last three years...

2:36:04.850 --> 2:36:09.230
...the division, the violence,
the disenchantment with our society...

2:36:09.313 --> 2:36:11.649
...the divisions between blacks
and whites...

2:36:11.732 --> 2:36:14.986
...the poor and the affluent,
between age groups...

2:36:15.111 --> 2:36:17.655
...or Vietnam, we can work together.

2:36:17.822 --> 2:36:21.701
We are a great country, an unselfish,
compassionate country.

2:36:21.784 --> 2:36:24.537
That's my basis for running.

2:36:28.416 --> 2:36:32.128
Thank you all.
It's on to Chicago and let's win there.

2:36:45.057 --> 2:36:47.059
Senator Kennedy has been shot!

2:37:29.894 --> 2:37:31.562
They killed him, honey.

2:37:34.148 --> 2:37:35.483
He won...

2:37:35.816 --> 2:37:38.152
...and they killed Robert Kennedy.

2:37:40.154 --> 2:37:41.656
They shot him down.

2:37:43.908 --> 2:37:45.326
Oh, my God!

2:37:48.079 --> 2:37:49.497
Both of them?

2:37:50.331 --> 2:37:51.874
Both brothers?

2:37:57.254 --> 2:37:58.756
You were right.

2:38:00.758 --> 2:38:02.593
It hasn't ended yet.

2:38:10.267 --> 2:38:12.019
For the first time...

2:38:13.688 --> 2:38:15.690
...I feel really scared.

2:38:28.536 --> 2:38:30.871
I wish I could've loved you more.

2:38:33.833 --> 2:38:38.295
Sometimes I feel like
I didn't ever love you...

2:38:39.213 --> 2:38:41.215
...or the children enough.

2:38:43.217 --> 2:38:44.552
I'm sorry.

2:39:28.262 --> 2:39:29.597
Please rise.

2:39:32.266 --> 2:39:36.979
The Criminal District Court for Orleans
Parish, Section H, is now in session.

2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:41.484
Honorable Judge Edward A. Haggerty, Jr.
presiding. Be seated.

2:39:46.906 --> 2:39:48.324
That's Clay Bertrand.

2:39:48.407 --> 2:39:50.368
That's who I saw at Ferrie's.

2:39:50.493 --> 2:39:52.328
That's who you say you saw.

2:39:53.496 --> 2:39:55.164
A confessed homosexual.

2:39:56.332 --> 2:39:58.709
Convicted of pandering and soliciting.

2:39:59.502 --> 2:40:01.837
A man who has lied about everything...

2:40:02.338 --> 2:40:04.924
...and now wants to be taken at his word.

2:40:05.007 --> 2:40:07.635
That man, right there. Yes, sir.

2:40:07.927 --> 2:40:10.262
He was at the Pontchartrain wall...

2:40:10.930 --> 2:40:13.349
...with the man who shot the President.

2:40:14.225 --> 2:40:16.769
I remember him because of his limp.

2:40:16.936 --> 2:40:19.855
A heroin addict injecting himself
at the wall.

2:40:20.272 --> 2:40:22.566
Barely conscious of his surroundings.

2:40:22.650 --> 2:40:25.528
- Is that the man?
- That was the man, right there.

2:40:25.778 --> 2:40:27.947
He dropped Oswald off on the voter's line.

2:40:28.322 --> 2:40:31.867
I remember 'cause they were the only
white strangers around that day.

2:40:31.951 --> 2:40:35.579
That big black Cadillac of his
made me think they might be FBl.

2:40:35.788 --> 2:40:38.874
Welcome to Clinton.
If you need any help, let us know.

2:40:38.958 --> 2:40:42.878
He said he was a representative
of Warren International Trade Mart.

2:40:43.421 --> 2:40:46.090
More than five years ago,
for two minutes...?

2:40:46.799 --> 2:40:49.051
It's fair to say you could be mistaken.

2:40:49.135 --> 2:40:51.262
Just a figment of my imagination.

2:40:51.512 --> 2:40:54.348
The cat's stewing you, I told him.

2:40:54.473 --> 2:40:57.351
You got the right ta-ta,
but the wrong ho-ho.

2:40:57.643 --> 2:41:01.397
Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor.
And you can tell him I said so.

2:41:01.480 --> 2:41:02.606
Objection, Your Honor!

2:41:02.690 --> 2:41:06.152
Andrews has been convicted of perjury
on this matter.

2:41:06.235 --> 2:41:08.779
Exception taken. That case is on appeal.

2:41:09.822 --> 2:41:11.115
Mr. Goldberg...

2:41:11.532 --> 2:41:14.327
...you claim you met Ferrie and Shaw
on a vacation trip...

2:41:14.410 --> 2:41:16.662
...from your accounting business
in New York.

2:41:16.746 --> 2:41:18.080
You had drinks...

2:41:18.164 --> 2:41:20.499
...and while drunk,
discussed killing Kennedy.

2:41:20.583 --> 2:41:22.626
- Is that not so?
- Yes, I did.

2:41:22.793 --> 2:41:27.340
Is it also true that you fingerprinted
your daughter when she went to college?

2:41:27.757 --> 2:41:28.924
Yes, sir, I did.

2:41:29.008 --> 2:41:32.928
Is it also true that you fingerprinted her
when she returned?

2:41:33.179 --> 2:41:34.305
Yes, I did.

2:41:34.680 --> 2:41:35.723
Why?

2:41:36.098 --> 2:41:39.352
I wanted to make sure
she was the same girl I sent away.

2:41:42.563 --> 2:41:44.565
He was one of Broussard's witnesses.

2:41:44.649 --> 2:41:47.360
He was totally sane
when we took his affidavit.

2:41:47.443 --> 2:41:51.739
Your Honor, we call Police Officer
Aloysius Habighorst to the stand.

2:41:52.281 --> 2:41:54.784
I must ask the jury to leave the court.

2:41:54.950 --> 2:41:57.328
Gentlemen, will you please rise
and follow me.

2:41:57.411 --> 2:42:00.414
- Name?
- Clay LaVerne Shaw.

2:42:00.539 --> 2:42:02.667
Defendant didn't have his lawyer present.

2:42:02.750 --> 2:42:05.878
It's standard booking procedure
to ask an alias!

2:42:05.961 --> 2:42:07.421
I call them as I see them!

2:42:07.505 --> 2:42:08.756
Any aliases?

2:42:08.881 --> 2:42:10.132
Clay Bertrand.

2:42:12.259 --> 2:42:16.013
It's not constitutionally required
that a lawyer be present!

2:42:16.806 --> 2:42:19.809
- I'm ruling that inadmissible!
- That's our case!

2:42:19.976 --> 2:42:22.186
Then you didn't have a case.

2:42:22.770 --> 2:42:25.690
I wouldn't believe anything
Habighorst said anyway.

2:42:25.773 --> 2:42:27.817
I can't believe you're saying this!

2:42:27.900 --> 2:42:30.111
I am saying it. Bring in the jury.

2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:36.367
- Oswald?
- No, I did not.

2:42:37.702 --> 2:42:40.955
- Ever call Dean Andrews?
- No, I did not.

2:42:42.331 --> 2:42:44.709
Have you ever met David Ferrie?

2:42:45.876 --> 2:42:49.547
Wouldn't even know what he looked like
if I hadn't seen pictures.

2:42:50.798 --> 2:42:53.092
Did you ever use the alias, Clay Bertrand?

2:42:53.217 --> 2:42:55.344
No, I did not.

2:42:56.637 --> 2:42:58.472
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

2:43:01.642 --> 2:43:04.895
A very great actor has just given us
a great performance.

2:43:05.271 --> 2:43:07.732
But we are nowhere closer to the truth.

2:43:08.274 --> 2:43:12.320
My office is charging Clay Shaw
with outright perjury...

2:43:12.445 --> 2:43:16.824
...on 15 answers he's given today,
not one word being true.

2:43:16.949 --> 2:43:19.493
You're out of order! Now, sit down!

2:43:19.785 --> 2:43:21.662
That's the man right there.

2:43:28.627 --> 2:43:31.797
To prove there was a conspiracy
involving Clay Shaw...

2:43:32.298 --> 2:43:36.594
...we must prove there was more than
one man involved in the assassination.

2:43:37.261 --> 2:43:38.346
To do that...

2:43:38.471 --> 2:43:42.058
...we must look at the Zapruder film
which my office subpoenaed.

2:43:42.808 --> 2:43:45.186
The American public has not seen...

2:43:47.146 --> 2:43:52.652
...has not seen the film. It's been locked
in a vault the last five years...

2:43:53.069 --> 2:43:55.613
...in the Time-Life Building in New York.

2:43:56.614 --> 2:43:58.407
There's a reason for that.

2:43:59.659 --> 2:44:00.576
Watch.

2:44:50.960 --> 2:44:53.254
"The picture speaks 1,000 words. "

2:44:55.006 --> 2:44:58.175
The Warren Commission thought they had
an open-and-shut case.

2:44:58.259 --> 2:45:00.136
Three bullets, one assassin.

2:45:01.220 --> 2:45:04.640
Two unpredictable things happened
that day to make it impossible.

2:45:04.724 --> 2:45:10.229
One, the film shot by Abraham Zapruder
while standing near the grassy knoll.

2:45:10.896 --> 2:45:15.109
Two, the third wounded man,
James Teague, nicked by a fragment...

2:45:15.359 --> 2:45:17.945
...while standing near the triple underpass.

2:45:18.070 --> 2:45:21.657
The time frame, 5.6 seconds,
established by the Zapruder film...

2:45:21.991 --> 2:45:24.452
...left no possibility of a fourth shot.

2:45:24.910 --> 2:45:29.040
So the shot of fragment that left
a superficial wound on Teague's cheek...

2:45:29.332 --> 2:45:33.711
...came from one of the three bullets
fired from the Depository's sixth floor.

2:45:34.462 --> 2:45:36.380
That leaves just two bullets.

2:45:36.881 --> 2:45:40.259
We know one was the fatal head shot
that killed Kennedy.

2:45:42.178 --> 2:45:43.971
So a single bullet remains.

2:45:44.263 --> 2:45:48.934
A single bullet must account for the seven
wounds in Kennedy and Connally.

2:45:49.810 --> 2:45:52.938
Rather than admit to a conspiracy
or investigate further...

2:45:53.064 --> 2:45:55.483
...the Warren Commission
endorsed the theory...

2:45:55.608 --> 2:45:58.903
...put forth by an ambitious attorney,
Arlen Spector.

2:45:59.028 --> 2:46:02.448
One of the grossest lies ever forced
on the American people.

2:46:04.033 --> 2:46:06.494
It's known as the "magic bullet" theory.

2:46:07.286 --> 2:46:08.746
The magic bullet...

2:46:08.954 --> 2:46:13.334
...enters the President's back,
headed downward at a 17-degree angle.

2:46:13.918 --> 2:46:18.631
It then moves upwards to leave Kennedy's
body from the front of his neck...

2:46:19.131 --> 2:46:20.675
...wound #2...

2:46:21.133 --> 2:46:23.177
...where it waits 1.6 seconds...

2:46:23.928 --> 2:46:27.723
...presumably in midair,
where it turns right, then left...

2:46:28.432 --> 2:46:30.309
...right, then left...

2:46:30.768 --> 2:46:34.146
...and continues
into Connally's right armpit.

2:46:34.438 --> 2:46:35.773
Wound #3.

2:46:36.440 --> 2:46:41.487
The bullet then heads down at an angle
of 27 degrees, shattering his rib...

2:46:41.946 --> 2:46:45.783
...and exiting from the right side
of his chest. Wound #4.

2:46:46.450 --> 2:46:51.122
The bullet turns right, reentering
Connally's body at his right wrist.

2:46:51.914 --> 2:46:53.249
Wound #5.

2:46:53.916 --> 2:46:55.835
Shattering the radius bone...

2:46:55.918 --> 2:46:58.796
...the bullet exits Connally's wrist,
wound #6...

2:46:59.296 --> 2:47:03.884
...makes a dramatic U-turn,
then buries itself in Connally's left thigh.

2:47:04.218 --> 2:47:07.179
Wound #7, from which it later falls out...

2:47:07.763 --> 2:47:10.516
...and is found
in almost pristine condition...

2:47:10.933 --> 2:47:14.020
...on a stretcher in a corridor
of Parkland Hospital.

2:47:16.522 --> 2:47:17.815
Some bullet.

2:47:19.650 --> 2:47:22.862
Any combat vet can tell you,
never in the history of gunfire...

2:47:22.945 --> 2:47:25.573
...has there been a bullet this ridiculous.

2:47:26.490 --> 2:47:31.329
The government says it can prove it
with some fancy physics in a nuclear lab.

2:47:31.829 --> 2:47:33.331
Of course they can.

2:47:33.414 --> 2:47:36.792
Theoretical physics can prove
an elephant can hang from a cliff...

2:47:36.876 --> 2:47:39.045
...with his tail tied to a daisy.

2:47:39.837 --> 2:47:42.214
But use your eyes, your common sense.

2:47:42.840 --> 2:47:47.136
The Army wound ballistics experts
fired some comparison bullets.

2:47:47.678 --> 2:47:50.264
Not one of them looked anything like this.

2:47:51.807 --> 2:47:53.893
Take a look at CE-856.

2:47:54.935 --> 2:47:56.562
An identical bullet...

2:47:56.729 --> 2:47:59.565
...fired through the wrist
of a human cadaver...

2:48:00.191 --> 2:48:03.277
...just one of the bones smashed
by the magic bullet.

2:48:04.278 --> 2:48:05.988
Seven wounds, gentlemen.

2:48:06.238 --> 2:48:07.573
Tough skin...

2:48:08.032 --> 2:48:09.617
...dense bones.

2:48:10.785 --> 2:48:12.953
This single-bullet explanation...

2:48:13.162 --> 2:48:17.124
...is the foundation of the Warren
Commission's claim of one assassin.

2:48:17.708 --> 2:48:19.085
And once you conclude...

2:48:19.168 --> 2:48:22.338
...the magic bullet couldn't create
all seven wounds...

2:48:22.505 --> 2:48:26.467
...you must conclude there was
a fourth shot and a second rifleman.

2:48:28.052 --> 2:48:30.388
And if there was a second rifleman...

2:48:30.805 --> 2:48:34.141
...then by definition there had
to be a conspiracy...

2:48:34.558 --> 2:48:37.812
...which we believe
involves the accused, Clay Shaw.

2:48:38.604 --> 2:48:43.734
Fifty-one witnesses thought
they heard shots from the grassy knoll...

2:48:44.068 --> 2:48:47.154
...which is to the right,
in front of the President.

2:48:48.239 --> 2:48:49.949
Key witnesses that day?

2:48:50.700 --> 2:48:52.952
Charles Brehm, a combat vet.

2:48:53.577 --> 2:48:56.122
Right behind, Jean Hill and Mary Moorman.

2:48:56.789 --> 2:48:59.458
S.M. Holland, Richard Dodd,
James Simmons...

2:48:59.750 --> 2:49:02.378
...standing on the overpass. J.C. Price...

2:49:02.461 --> 2:49:04.213
...overlooking the plaza.

2:49:05.089 --> 2:49:07.842
William Newman, father of two children.

2:49:08.009 --> 2:49:10.553
He hit the deck on the north side of Elm.

2:49:11.804 --> 2:49:13.472
Abraham Zapruder.

2:49:30.197 --> 2:49:33.284
Each of these key witnesses
has no doubt whatsoever...

2:49:33.451 --> 2:49:36.620
...one or more shots came
from behind the picket fence.

2:49:37.496 --> 2:49:40.791
Twenty-six trained medical personnel
at Parkland Hospital...

2:49:40.875 --> 2:49:44.628
...saw the back of the President's head
blasted out!

2:49:46.922 --> 2:49:48.466
Doctor Peters.

2:49:49.008 --> 2:49:53.763
There was a large 7 cm opening
at the right occipital parietal area.

2:49:53.888 --> 2:49:56.807
A considerable portion
of the brain was missing.

2:49:58.351 --> 2:50:03.189
A fifth or possibly a quarter of the back
of the head had been blasted out...

2:50:03.356 --> 2:50:05.566
...along with the underlying brain tissue.

2:50:05.650 --> 2:50:08.235
When's the proper time
to declare one dead?

2:50:08.694 --> 2:50:12.782
There was also a large fragment of skull
attached to a flap of the scalp.

2:50:13.074 --> 2:50:17.078
The exit hole in the rear of his head
measured about 120 mm...

2:50:17.203 --> 2:50:18.871
...or five inches, across.

2:50:18.954 --> 2:50:22.917
Not one of the civilian doctors
who examined the President...

2:50:23.334 --> 2:50:26.796
...regarded his throat wound as anything
but an entry wound.

2:50:27.505 --> 2:50:31.092
But then the body was illegally moved
to Washington for the autopsy.

2:50:31.175 --> 2:50:33.427
Because when a coup d'état has occurred...

2:50:33.511 --> 2:50:37.932
...there's a big difference between
an autopsy performed by civilian doctors...

2:50:38.015 --> 2:50:41.560
...and one that is performed
by military doctors under orders.

2:50:42.687 --> 2:50:47.733
The departure of Air Force One, Friday
afternoon was not so much a takeoff...

2:50:47.817 --> 2:50:51.028
...as it was a getaway,
with the newly sworn in President.

2:50:51.112 --> 2:50:52.238
Objection!

2:50:52.321 --> 2:50:53.280
Sustained.

2:50:53.364 --> 2:50:57.952
On the plane, the White House Situation
Room announced Oswald's guilt...

2:50:58.035 --> 2:51:01.831
...to all passengers before any kind
of investigation had begun.

2:51:02.081 --> 2:51:05.042
The "angry lone nut" solution
is beginning to take shape.

2:51:05.126 --> 2:51:07.670
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

2:51:09.463 --> 2:51:11.424
Please bottle the acid.

2:51:13.551 --> 2:51:18.431
The three Bethesda doctors picked by
the military left something to be desired.

2:51:18.556 --> 2:51:22.184
None of them had experience
with combat-gunfire wounds.

2:51:22.601 --> 2:51:27.106
Through their autopsy, we've been able
to justify eight wounds from two bullets.

2:51:27.231 --> 2:51:29.608
Three to Kennedy, five to Connally.

2:51:29.692 --> 2:51:32.028
One of them being the "magic bullet. "

2:51:32.194 --> 2:51:33.654
- FBl?
- Here.

2:51:33.738 --> 2:51:37.533
Col. Finck, are you saying someone
told you not to dissect the neck?

2:51:37.616 --> 2:51:40.911
I was told the family wanted
the examination of the head.

2:51:41.662 --> 2:51:42.913
Oh, Christ.

2:51:43.080 --> 2:51:44.832
Looks like half his brain is gone.

2:51:44.915 --> 2:51:47.251
- Weigh it.
-653 grams.

2:51:47.335 --> 2:51:50.463
As a pathologist, it was your obligation
to explore...

2:51:50.546 --> 2:51:52.423
...all possible causes of death.

2:51:52.506 --> 2:51:54.091
I had the cause of death.

2:51:54.175 --> 2:51:57.595
Your Honor, please direct the witness
to answer my question.

2:51:58.554 --> 2:52:01.849
Why did Col. Finck not dissect
the tract of the bullet wound?

2:52:01.932 --> 2:52:03.934
I heard Dr. Humes stating...

2:52:04.185 --> 2:52:06.270
That's enough. That's enough.

2:52:06.395 --> 2:52:07.813
It's duly noted.

2:52:08.272 --> 2:52:09.940
Let's check the back.

2:52:17.615 --> 2:52:19.992
I can feel the end of the wound
with my finger.

2:52:20.076 --> 2:52:21.994
That won't be necessary.

2:52:24.789 --> 2:52:26.332
Watch the ear!

2:52:27.708 --> 2:52:30.044
Shot in the back. Cheap crime.

2:52:30.336 --> 2:52:31.337
He said:

2:52:31.587 --> 2:52:33.297
Who's in charge here?

2:52:33.673 --> 2:52:34.757
I am.

2:52:36.050 --> 2:52:37.510
I don't remember his name.

2:52:38.177 --> 2:52:39.804
It was quite crowded.

2:52:40.221 --> 2:52:43.975
And when you are called to look
at the wounds of the dead President...

2:52:44.058 --> 2:52:47.144
...you don't ask people for their names
and who they are.

2:52:47.228 --> 2:52:51.399
But you were a qualified pathologist.
Was the Army General?

2:52:51.941 --> 2:52:52.775
No.

2:52:53.651 --> 2:52:55.027
But you took his orders.

2:52:55.695 --> 2:52:56.570
Yes.

2:52:56.737 --> 2:52:59.156
- So he was directing the autopsy.
- No.

2:52:59.407 --> 2:53:01.492
There were others.

2:53:02.326 --> 2:53:03.869
There were admirals.

2:53:06.122 --> 2:53:09.083
When you're a Lieutenant Colonel,
you follow orders.

2:53:09.166 --> 2:53:13.754
It is not our business to discuss this
with anyone outside this room.

2:53:13.838 --> 2:53:16.841
As I recall, Admiral Kenney,
Navy Surgeon General...

2:53:17.174 --> 2:53:20.428
...specifically told us
not to discuss the case.

2:53:23.264 --> 2:53:26.350
A lot of people were deciding
what was private...

2:53:26.851 --> 2:53:29.437
...none of the American people's business.

2:53:29.520 --> 2:53:31.605
The chief pathologist, Commander Humes...

2:53:31.689 --> 2:53:35.234
...by his own admission,
voluntarily burned his autopsy notes.

2:53:35.568 --> 2:53:38.362
President Johnson orders
the blood-soaked limousine...

2:53:38.446 --> 2:53:42.033
...filled with bullet holes and clues
to be washed and rebuilt.

2:53:42.366 --> 2:53:45.202
He sends Connally's bloody suit
to the cleaners.

2:53:46.370 --> 2:53:50.333
The Justice Department denied this office
access to the autopsy photos.

2:53:51.459 --> 2:53:55.838
When we finally get a court order
to examine Kennedy's brain...

2:53:56.255 --> 2:53:59.717
...in the hopes of finding
from which direction the bullet came...

2:53:59.800 --> 2:54:01.135
...we're told...

2:54:01.969 --> 2:54:05.973
...by your government that
the President's brain has disappeared.

2:54:09.393 --> 2:54:13.022
That's not all that's disappeared.
With it, the concept of justice.

2:54:13.105 --> 2:54:17.652
Objection. Mr. Garrison is insulting
the federal government-

2:54:18.319 --> 2:54:19.945
Overruled!

2:54:26.994 --> 2:54:29.163
So, what really happened that day?

2:54:29.747 --> 2:54:32.375
Let's just for a moment speculate,
shall we?

2:54:32.833 --> 2:54:35.670
We have the epileptic seizure...

2:54:35.753 --> 2:54:39.757
...distracting the police and allowing
the shooters to get into place.

2:54:40.758 --> 2:54:44.845
The epileptic later vanished,
never checking into the hospital.

2:54:46.097 --> 2:54:49.183
The A-team goes to the sixth floor
of the Depository.

2:54:49.350 --> 2:54:52.520
They were refurbishing the floors
of the Depository that week...

2:54:52.603 --> 2:54:55.231
...allowing unknown workmen
in the building.

2:54:55.940 --> 2:54:59.443
They move quickly into position,
minutes before the shooting.

2:54:59.986 --> 2:55:04.573
The second spotter, talking by radio to
the other teams, has the best overall view.

2:55:05.199 --> 2:55:06.450
The God spot.

2:55:06.826 --> 2:55:11.622
B- team, one rifleman and one spotter
with access to the building...

2:55:11.872 --> 2:55:14.792
...moves into a low floor
of the Dal-Tex building.

2:55:15.793 --> 2:55:20.548
The third team, C-team, moves in
behind the fence above the grassy knoll...

2:55:20.881 --> 2:55:25.469
...where the shooter and the spotter
are first seen by the late Lee Bowers.

2:55:26.220 --> 2:55:28.222
They have the best position.

2:55:28.806 --> 2:55:31.934
Kennedy is close and on a flat,
low trajectory.

2:55:32.476 --> 2:55:34.478
Part of this team is a coordinator...

2:55:34.562 --> 2:55:38.899
...who flashed security credentials
at people, chasing them from the area.

2:55:39.984 --> 2:55:43.738
Probably two to three more men
are in the crowd.

2:55:44.071 --> 2:55:47.700
Ten to twelve men.
Three teams. Three shooters.

2:55:48.242 --> 2:55:52.913
The triangulation of fire Clay Shaw and
David Ferrie discussed two months before.

2:55:53.956 --> 2:55:55.666
They blocked the plaza.

2:55:56.083 --> 2:55:57.877
They know every inch.

2:55:59.795 --> 2:56:03.549
They've calibrated their sights.
Practiced on moving targets.

2:56:04.675 --> 2:56:05.926
They're ready.

2:56:06.761 --> 2:56:10.056
Kennedy's motorcade makes a turn
from Main onto Houston.

2:56:11.015 --> 2:56:13.100
It's going to be a turkey shoot.

2:56:14.769 --> 2:56:16.854
They don't shoot him on Houston...

2:56:16.937 --> 2:56:20.316
...the easiest shot for a single shooter
in the Depository.

2:56:20.691 --> 2:56:24.445
They wait till he gets to the killing zone
between three rifles.

2:56:25.696 --> 2:56:28.783
Kennedy makes the turn
from Houston onto Elm.

2:56:29.617 --> 2:56:32.995
Slowing down to some 11 miles an hour.

2:56:33.704 --> 2:56:37.541
The shooters across Dealey Plaza tighten,
taking their aim.

2:56:39.335 --> 2:56:43.089
Waiting for the radio to say,
"Green! Green! "

2:56:43.464 --> 2:56:45.841
Or, "Abort! Abort! "

2:56:52.139 --> 2:56:53.891
The first shot rings out.

2:56:54.809 --> 2:56:57.979
Sounding like a backfire,
it misses the car completely.

2:56:58.437 --> 2:57:01.524
Frame 161, Kennedy stops waving
as he hears something.

2:57:02.066 --> 2:57:04.735
Connally's head turns slightly to the right.

2:57:05.027 --> 2:57:08.948
Frame 193, the second shot hits Kennedy
in the throat from the front.

2:57:09.740 --> 2:57:13.077
Frame 225, Kennedy emerges
from behind the road sign.

2:57:13.411 --> 2:57:16.831
He's been hit, raising his hands
to his throat.

2:57:17.498 --> 2:57:19.750
The third shot, frame 232...

2:57:19.959 --> 2:57:23.504
...hits Kennedy in the back,
pulling him downward and forward.

2:57:23.838 --> 2:57:27.008
Connally, you will notice,
shows no sign of being hit.

2:57:27.258 --> 2:57:31.345
He is holding his Stetson, which is
impossible if his wrist is shattered.

2:57:31.429 --> 2:57:33.264
Connally is turning now.

2:57:33.347 --> 2:57:35.808
Frame 238. The fourth shot.

2:57:35.933 --> 2:57:39.228
It misses Kennedy and takes Connally
in the back.

2:57:39.520 --> 2:57:42.440
This is the shot that proves
there were two rifles.

2:57:42.523 --> 2:57:46.027
Connally yells, "My God!
They're going to kill us all! "

2:57:46.277 --> 2:57:49.655
Around this time,
another shot misses the car completely...

2:57:49.780 --> 2:57:52.366
...striking James Teague by the underpass.

2:57:53.284 --> 2:57:54.535
The car brakes.

2:57:54.785 --> 2:57:56.537
The sixth and fatal shot.

2:57:56.704 --> 2:58:00.166
Frame 313, takes Kennedy in the head
from the front.

2:58:01.667 --> 2:58:03.336
This is the key shot.

2:58:03.961 --> 2:58:06.964
The President going back and to his left...

2:58:07.173 --> 2:58:09.342
...shot from the front and right.

2:58:10.301 --> 2:58:13.721
Totally inconsistent with the shot
from the Depository.

2:58:13.888 --> 2:58:14.847
Again.

2:58:18.768 --> 2:58:20.686
Back, and to the left.

2:58:22.104 --> 2:58:23.939
Back, and to the left.

2:58:25.316 --> 2:58:27.109
Back, and to the left.

2:58:29.487 --> 2:58:31.322
So what happens then?

2:58:33.741 --> 2:58:34.992
Pandemonium.

2:58:37.912 --> 2:58:39.830
Let's go! We got him!

2:58:45.336 --> 2:58:50.132
The shooters quickly disassemble their
various weapons, except the Oswald rifle.

2:59:01.268 --> 2:59:04.689
Patrolman Smith rushes to the parking lot
behind the fence.

2:59:05.356 --> 2:59:06.774
He smells gunpowder.

2:59:06.857 --> 2:59:10.611
He produced credentials showing him
to be Secret Service.

2:59:11.696 --> 2:59:14.365
Let's see your ID.
See anyone else up here?

2:59:15.533 --> 2:59:17.910
I accepted that and let him go.

2:59:18.869 --> 2:59:21.914
I regretted it. He looked like a mechanic.

2:59:22.707 --> 2:59:26.877
He had on a sports shirt and pants,
but he had dirty fingernails.

2:59:28.713 --> 2:59:31.632
Afterward, it didn't ring true.
But at the time...

2:59:31.716 --> 2:59:33.759
...we were so pressed for time.

2:59:34.635 --> 2:59:37.638
All Secret Servicemen
in Dallas are accounted for.

2:59:38.431 --> 2:59:41.684
None were on foot in Dealey Plaza
before or after the shooting...

2:59:41.767 --> 2:59:45.604
...till the Dallas Secret Service chief
returned at 12:55.

2:59:46.397 --> 2:59:50.234
The Dallas police took at least 12 people
into custody.

2:59:51.235 --> 2:59:52.862
No record of their arrest.

2:59:52.945 --> 2:59:56.615
Men acting like hoboes
were pulled off trains...

2:59:56.824 --> 2:59:59.285
...marched through Dealey Plaza,
photographed.

2:59:59.410 --> 3:00:01.620
Yet there's no record of their arrest.

3:00:01.746 --> 3:00:05.499
Men identifying themselves
as Secret Service agents were everywhere.

3:00:06.417 --> 3:00:08.461
But who was impersonating them?

3:00:08.753 --> 3:00:10.338
Where was Oswald?

3:00:11.005 --> 3:00:15.259
Around 12:15, leaving the building
to see the motorcade...

3:00:15.343 --> 3:00:18.429
...Carolyn Arnold sees Oswald
in the second-floor snack room...

3:00:18.512 --> 3:00:20.723
...where he said he went for a Coke.

3:00:21.432 --> 3:00:24.685
He was in a booth on the right side
of the room.

3:00:25.186 --> 3:00:28.856
He was by himself as usual,
appeared to be having lunch.

3:00:29.190 --> 3:00:32.193
I didn't speak to him,
but I recognized him clearly.

3:00:32.526 --> 3:00:37.156
At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams is
supposedly eating lunch in the sixth floor.

3:00:37.698 --> 3:00:40.534
He's there until 12:15, maybe 12:20.

3:00:41.327 --> 3:00:42.870
He sees nobody.

3:00:43.537 --> 3:00:48.000
Arnold Rowlands, on the street, looks up,
sees two men in the sixth-floor windows...

3:00:48.084 --> 3:00:51.587
...presumably after Williams
finished his lunch and left.

3:00:52.213 --> 3:00:56.133
John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth floor
of the county jail, sees them.

3:00:56.217 --> 3:00:57.677
Many of us saw them.

3:00:57.760 --> 3:01:01.681
Everyone was hollering and yelling.
We thought they was security guys.

3:01:02.390 --> 3:01:07.019
If Oswald was the assassin, he was
nonchalant about moving into position.

3:01:07.645 --> 3:01:11.232
Later, he told police he was
in the second-floor snack room.

3:01:11.524 --> 3:01:14.694
Probably told to wait there
by his handler for a call.

3:01:16.320 --> 3:01:18.364
But the phone call never came.

3:01:18.990 --> 3:01:21.659
Maximum 90 seconds
after Kennedy is shot...

3:01:21.742 --> 3:01:25.663
...Patrolman Marrion Baker sees Oswald
in that second-floor lunchroom.

3:01:27.164 --> 3:01:28.791
Is this man an employee?

3:01:28.916 --> 3:01:31.669
Yes. The President's been shot.

3:01:31.794 --> 3:01:33.838
The Commission would have us believe...

3:01:33.921 --> 3:01:37.425
...that after firing three bolt-action shots
in 5.6 seconds...

3:01:37.925 --> 3:01:42.388
...Oswald then leaves three cartridges
neatly side-by-side in the firing nest...

3:01:42.596 --> 3:01:47.143
...wipes fingerprints off the rifle,
stashes it on the other side of the loft...

3:01:48.185 --> 3:01:50.479
...sprints down five flights of stairs...

3:01:50.604 --> 3:01:54.066
...past Victoria Adams and Sandra Styles
who never see him...

3:01:54.859 --> 3:01:59.322
...then shows up, cool and calm, on the
second floor in front of Patrolman Baker.

3:02:00.865 --> 3:02:04.035
All this within a maximum of 90 seconds
of the shooting.

3:02:04.785 --> 3:02:06.787
Is this man an employee?

3:02:06.912 --> 3:02:08.956
Yes. The President's been shot.

3:02:09.123 --> 3:02:10.666
Is he out of breath?

3:02:11.125 --> 3:02:13.669
According to Baker, absolutely not.

3:02:14.045 --> 3:02:18.966
Assuming he is the sole assassin,
Oswald is free to leave the building.

3:02:19.634 --> 3:02:24.013
The longer he delays, the more chance
the building will be sealed by police.

3:02:24.889 --> 3:02:28.225
Is he guilty? Does he walk
out the nearest staircase?

3:02:30.394 --> 3:02:32.104
He buys a Coke...

3:02:32.355 --> 3:02:36.567
...and at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid
on the second floor...

3:02:36.984 --> 3:02:39.487
...he strolls out
the more distant front exit...

3:02:39.612 --> 3:02:41.238
...where cops have gathered.

3:02:41.364 --> 3:02:44.408
Odd, since three shots were fired
from there...

3:02:44.533 --> 3:02:47.495
...nobody seals the Depository
for ten more minutes.

3:02:47.912 --> 3:02:50.831
Oswald slips out,
as do several other employees.

3:02:51.165 --> 3:02:55.211
When he realized something had gone
wrong and Kennedy had been killed...

3:02:55.753 --> 3:02:59.674
...he knew there was a problem.
Maybe even that he was the patsy.

3:03:00.174 --> 3:03:04.387
An intuition, maybe. The President killed
in spite of his warning.

3:03:04.470 --> 3:03:06.389
The phone call that never came.

3:03:06.514 --> 3:03:09.809
Perhaps fear now came to Oswald
for the very first time.

3:03:11.435 --> 3:03:14.689
Oswald returns to his rooming house
around 1:00 p. m...

3:03:14.814 --> 3:03:17.191
...a half hour after the assassination.

3:03:17.441 --> 3:03:19.110
A man shot the President!

3:03:19.235 --> 3:03:22.196
He puts on his jacket,
grabs his. 38 revolver...

3:03:22.363 --> 3:03:24.240
...and leaves at 1:04.

3:03:24.865 --> 3:03:27.952
Earlene Roberts, the housekeeper,
heard two beeps on a car horn.

3:03:28.077 --> 3:03:31.580
Two uniformed cops pulled up
while Oswald was in his room.

3:03:31.706 --> 3:03:33.249
Like it was a signal.

3:03:34.375 --> 3:03:38.796
Officer Tippit is shot between 1:10
and 1:15, a mile away.

3:03:38.963 --> 3:03:41.549
And though no one saw him walking...

3:03:41.799 --> 3:03:44.593
...the government says
Oswald covered that distance.

3:03:44.719 --> 3:03:47.221
Giving the government the benefit
of the doubt...

3:03:47.305 --> 3:03:50.433
...Oswald would've had to jog a mile
in six to eleven minutes...

3:03:50.558 --> 3:03:53.311
...then commit the murder,
reverse his direction...

3:03:53.394 --> 3:03:56.439
...and walk three-fifths of a mile
to the Texas Theater...

3:03:56.522 --> 3:03:59.108
...and arrive sometime before 1:30.

3:04:04.530 --> 3:04:06.240
It's also a useful conclusion.

3:04:06.324 --> 3:04:08.868
After all, why would Oswald
kill Officer Tippit...

3:04:08.951 --> 3:04:12.121
...unless he just shot the President
and feared arrest?

3:04:12.705 --> 3:04:14.540
Domingo Benevides...

3:04:16.125 --> 3:04:18.377
...the closest witness to the shooting...

3:04:18.461 --> 3:04:22.715
...refused to identify Oswald as the killer
and was never taken to a lineup.

3:04:23.174 --> 3:04:24.342
Acquilla Clemons...

3:04:24.425 --> 3:04:28.304
...saw the killer and another man
go off in separate directions.

3:04:28.638 --> 3:04:32.308
Mrs. Clemons was never taken to a lineup
or to the Warren Commission.

3:04:32.933 --> 3:04:36.979
At the scene, Officer Poe marks
his initials on the shells...

3:04:37.104 --> 3:04:39.315
...to record the chain of evidence.

3:04:39.690 --> 3:04:42.610
Those initials are not
on the three cartridge cases...

3:04:42.693 --> 3:04:45.196
...which the Warren Commission show him.

3:04:45.529 --> 3:04:49.492
As early as 12:44, only 14 minutes
after the assassination...

3:04:50.034 --> 3:04:54.205
...the police put out a description
matching Oswald's size and build.

3:04:54.872 --> 3:04:59.752
Oswald is next seen by a shoe salesman,
Johnny Brewer, on Jefferson Avenue.

3:05:00.503 --> 3:05:05.132
Oswald is scared. He begins to realize
the full implications of this thing.

3:05:05.216 --> 3:05:09.011
He goes to the Texas Theater,
possibly a prearranged meeting point.

3:05:09.303 --> 3:05:14.016
Though he has $14 in his pocket,
he doesn't buy the $0.75 ticket.

3:05:14.350 --> 3:05:16.644
Brewer has the cashier call the police.

3:05:16.727 --> 3:05:18.896
In response to that call...

3:05:19.313 --> 3:05:23.651
...at least 30 officers in patrol cars
descend on the movie theater.

3:05:23.985 --> 3:05:27.321
This is the most remarkable example
of police intuition...

3:05:27.488 --> 3:05:29.657
...since the Reichstag fire.

3:05:30.408 --> 3:05:31.701
I don't buy it!

3:05:31.826 --> 3:05:35.997
They knew. Someone knew
Oswald would be there.

3:05:36.580 --> 3:05:39.000
Brewer leads the cops into the theater...

3:05:39.083 --> 3:05:41.210
...and from the stage, points Oswald out.

3:05:41.294 --> 3:05:42.378
There he is.

3:05:54.765 --> 3:05:57.143
Sir, can I get you to stand up?

3:06:03.024 --> 3:06:07.570
I am not resisting arrest!
I am not resisting arrest!

3:06:07.695 --> 3:06:09.238
They have their man.

3:06:10.239 --> 3:06:13.117
It's already been decided in Washington.

3:06:13.909 --> 3:06:16.454
When he is brought from the theater...

3:06:16.746 --> 3:06:19.123
...a crowd is waiting to scream at him.

3:06:19.373 --> 3:06:22.918
Lee Oswald must have felt like Joseph K.
in Kafka's The Trial.

3:06:23.044 --> 3:06:25.379
He's never given reasons for his arrest.

3:06:25.463 --> 3:06:28.633
He doesn't know the unseen forces
ranging against him.

3:06:29.133 --> 3:06:32.887
At police headquarters, he was booked
for murdering Tippit.

3:06:33.054 --> 3:06:34.889
No legal counsel was provided.

3:06:34.972 --> 3:06:37.141
No record made of the questioning.

3:06:37.308 --> 3:06:40.019
When the sun rises the next morning...

3:06:40.144 --> 3:06:42.772
...he is booked for murdering the President.

3:06:42.855 --> 3:06:46.817
The whole country, fueled by the media,
assumes he is guilty.

3:06:47.401 --> 3:06:49.695
Under the guise of a patriotic club owner...

3:06:49.779 --> 3:06:53.199
...out to spare Jackie Kennedy
from testifying at a trial...

3:06:53.908 --> 3:06:56.410
...Jack Ruby is let into a garage...

3:06:56.494 --> 3:06:59.413
...by one of his inside men
on the police force.

3:07:00.289 --> 3:07:04.126
Oswald is brought out
like a sacrificial lamb...

3:07:04.251 --> 3:07:07.421
...and nicely disposed of as an enemy
of the people.

3:07:26.065 --> 3:07:28.025
Who grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald...

3:07:28.943 --> 3:07:31.821
...buried in a cheap grave
under the name Oswald?

3:07:32.905 --> 3:07:33.906
Nobody.

3:07:41.622 --> 3:07:46.377
False statements and press leaks
about Oswald circulate the globe.

3:07:47.545 --> 3:07:50.798
The official legend is created
and the media takes it from there.

3:07:52.341 --> 3:07:56.304
The glitter of official lies
and the epic splendor of JFK's funeral...

3:07:56.387 --> 3:07:59.724
...confuse the eye
and confound the understanding.

3:08:01.017 --> 3:08:02.476
Hitler said:

3:08:03.060 --> 3:08:06.314
"The bigger the lie,
the more people will believe it. "

3:08:07.690 --> 3:08:11.235
Lee Harvey Oswald, a crazed,
lonely man who wanted attention...

3:08:11.319 --> 3:08:15.865
...and got it by killing a President was
only the first in a long line of patsies.

3:08:16.574 --> 3:08:19.535
In later years, Bobby Kennedy,
Martin Luther King...

3:08:19.618 --> 3:08:22.288
...men whose commitment
to change and peace...

3:08:22.371 --> 3:08:25.958
...made them dangerous to men
committed to war, would follow...

3:08:26.500 --> 3:08:29.420
...also killed by such lonely, crazed men.

3:08:30.338 --> 3:08:34.634
Men who remove all guilt by making
murder a meaningless act of a loner.

3:08:35.968 --> 3:08:40.306
We've all become Hamlets in our country,
children of a slain father-leader...

3:08:40.431 --> 3:08:43.017
...whose killers still possess the throne.

3:08:43.225 --> 3:08:46.937
The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us
with the secret murder...

3:08:47.021 --> 3:08:49.273
...at the heart of the American Dream.

3:08:49.357 --> 3:08:53.819
He forces on us the appalling questions:
Of what is our Constitution made?

3:08:54.654 --> 3:08:56.947
What are our lives worth?

3:08:57.031 --> 3:08:59.033
What is the future of a democracy...

3:08:59.116 --> 3:09:03.412
...where a President can be assassinated
under suspicious circumstances...

3:09:03.496 --> 3:09:06.791
...while the machinery of legal action
scarcely trembles?

3:09:07.917 --> 3:09:11.420
How many more political murders
disguised as heart attacks...

3:09:11.671 --> 3:09:14.215
...suicides, cancers, drug overdoses?

3:09:14.298 --> 3:09:16.968
How many plane and car crashes
will occur...

3:09:17.134 --> 3:09:19.804
...before they are exposed
for what they are?

3:09:21.472 --> 3:09:24.517
"Treason doth never prosper,"
wrote an English poet.

3:09:25.184 --> 3:09:26.727
"What's the reason?

3:09:27.436 --> 3:09:30.189
"For if it prosper,
none dare call it treason. "

3:09:30.815 --> 3:09:33.901
The American public has yet
to see the Zapruder film.

3:09:34.443 --> 3:09:35.528
Why?

3:09:36.028 --> 3:09:40.241
The American public has yet to see
the real X-rays and autopsy photographs.

3:09:40.324 --> 3:09:41.242
Why?

3:09:42.284 --> 3:09:45.496
Hundreds of documents could help prove
this conspiracy.

3:09:45.579 --> 3:09:48.791
Why are they being withheld
or burned by the government?

3:09:49.792 --> 3:09:54.422
When my office or you, the people, asked
those questions, demanded evidence...

3:09:54.505 --> 3:09:58.426
...the answer from on high
has always been: national security.

3:09:59.510 --> 3:10:03.723
What kind of national security do we have
when we're robbed of our leaders?

3:10:04.223 --> 3:10:06.684
What national security
permits the removal...

3:10:06.767 --> 3:10:09.270
...of fundamental power from the people...

3:10:09.353 --> 3:10:13.274
...and validates the ascendancy
of an invisible government in the US?

3:10:14.608 --> 3:10:16.610
That kind of national security is...

3:10:16.694 --> 3:10:20.239
...when it smells like it, feels like it,
and looks like it...

3:10:20.865 --> 3:10:22.658
...you call it what it is:

3:10:23.034 --> 3:10:24.327
Fascism!

3:10:26.495 --> 3:10:31.542
I submit to you that what took place
on November 22, 1963...

3:10:31.667 --> 3:10:33.294
...was a coup d'etat.

3:10:34.045 --> 3:10:36.297
Its most direct and tragic result...

3:10:36.547 --> 3:10:40.551
...was the reversal of Kennedy's decision
to withdraw from Vietnam.

3:10:41.886 --> 3:10:44.472
The war is the biggest business
in America...

3:10:44.555 --> 3:10:46.724
...worth $80 billion a year.

3:10:47.850 --> 3:10:50.645
President Kennedy was murdered
by a conspiracy...

3:10:50.728 --> 3:10:53.648
...planned at the highest levels
of our government...

3:10:53.731 --> 3:10:57.318
...carried out by fanatical
and disciplined cold warriors...

3:10:57.485 --> 3:11:00.988
...in the Pentagon and CIA's
covert-operation apparatus.

3:11:01.072 --> 3:11:03.699
Among them, Clay Shaw, here before you.

3:11:04.533 --> 3:11:07.745
It was a public execution,
and it was covered up by...

3:11:07.828 --> 3:11:10.831
...like-minded people
in the Dallas Police...

3:11:10.957 --> 3:11:14.210
...the Secret Service, the FBl,
and the White House...

3:11:14.293 --> 3:11:18.172
...up to and including J. Edgar Hoover,
and Lyndon Johnson...

3:11:18.631 --> 3:11:21.050
...who were accomplices after the fact.

3:11:21.634 --> 3:11:25.638
The assassination reduced the President
to a transient official.

3:11:26.347 --> 3:11:31.644
His job is to speak as often as possible
of the nation's desire for peace...

3:11:32.186 --> 3:11:34.939
...while he acts as a business agent
in the Congress...

3:11:35.022 --> 3:11:37.066
...for the military and their contractors.

3:11:39.443 --> 3:11:41.570
Some people say I'm crazy.

3:11:43.072 --> 3:11:46.033
Southern caricature seeking higher office.

3:11:48.202 --> 3:11:51.205
There's a simple way to determine
if I am paranoid.

3:11:51.414 --> 3:11:54.375
Ask the two men who profited most
from the assassination...

3:11:54.458 --> 3:11:58.379
...former President Johnson
and your new President, Nixon...

3:11:58.546 --> 3:12:03.259
...to release the 51 CIA documents
pertaining to Lee Oswald and Jack Ruby.

3:12:04.176 --> 3:12:05.886
Or the secret CIA memo...

3:12:06.012 --> 3:12:10.433
...on Oswald's activities in Russia that
was destroyed while being photocopied.

3:12:10.599 --> 3:12:12.393
These documents are yours.

3:12:13.060 --> 3:12:15.438
The people's property. You pay for it.

3:12:16.230 --> 3:12:18.482
But as the government sees you
as children...

3:12:18.566 --> 3:12:21.777
...who might be too disturbed
to face this reality...

3:12:22.445 --> 3:12:25.197
...or because you might lynch
those involved...

3:12:26.157 --> 3:12:29.327
...you cannot see these documents
for another 75 years.

3:12:30.369 --> 3:12:32.038
I'm in my 40s...

3:12:33.247 --> 3:12:36.083
...so I'll have "shuffled off
this mortal coil" by then.

3:12:36.167 --> 3:12:40.671
But I'm telling my eight-year-old son
to keep himself physically fit...

3:12:41.547 --> 3:12:45.468
...so that one glorious September morning,
in 2038...

3:12:45.593 --> 3:12:50.765
...he can go to the National Archives
and learn what the CIA and FBI knew.

3:12:52.141 --> 3:12:54.060
They may push it back then.

3:12:54.143 --> 3:12:59.106
It may become a generational affair.
Questions passed from parent to child.

3:12:59.523 --> 3:13:03.444
But someday, somewhere,
someone may find out the damn truth.

3:13:04.528 --> 3:13:05.655
We better.

3:13:06.781 --> 3:13:10.618
Or we might just as well build ourselves
another government...

3:13:10.910 --> 3:13:15.247
...like the Declaration of Independence
says to, when the old one don't work.

3:13:15.456 --> 3:13:17.166
Just a bit farther out West.

3:13:19.001 --> 3:13:20.962
An American naturalist wrote:

3:13:21.295 --> 3:13:24.507
"A patriot must always be ready
to defend his country...

3:13:24.757 --> 3:13:26.676
"... against its government. "

3:13:28.302 --> 3:13:30.513
I'd hate to be in your shoes today.

3:13:31.180 --> 3:13:35.393
You have a lot to think about. You've seen
evidence the public hasn't seen.

3:13:37.019 --> 3:13:39.438
Going back to when we were children...

3:13:40.147 --> 3:13:44.902
...I think most of us in this courtroom
thought justice came automatically.

3:13:46.112 --> 3:13:48.155
That virtue was its own reward.

3:13:48.239 --> 3:13:50.241
That good triumphs over evil.

3:13:51.409 --> 3:13:54.245
But as we get older
we know this isn't true.

3:13:55.204 --> 3:13:59.375
Individual human beings have to create
justice, and this is not easy...

3:14:00.835 --> 3:14:03.921
...because the truth often poses a threat
to power...

3:14:04.338 --> 3:14:07.967
...and one often has to fight power
at great risk to themselves.

3:14:08.175 --> 3:14:10.094
People like S.M. Holland...

3:14:10.678 --> 3:14:12.054
...Lee Bowers...

3:14:12.555 --> 3:14:14.265
...Jean Hill, Willie O'Keefe...

3:14:14.348 --> 3:14:17.643
...have all taken that risk
and they've all come forward.

3:14:17.810 --> 3:14:20.813
I have here some $8,000 in these letters...

3:14:21.772 --> 3:14:24.025
...sent from all over the country.

3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:27.069
Quarters, dimes, dollars from housewives...

3:14:27.737 --> 3:14:30.573
...plumbers, car salesmen,
teachers, invalids.

3:14:31.782 --> 3:14:34.994
These are people who cannot afford
to send money but do.

3:14:36.120 --> 3:14:37.955
People who drive cabs...

3:14:38.497 --> 3:14:40.124
...who nurse in hospitals...

3:14:40.207 --> 3:14:42.835
...who see their kids go to Vietnam.

3:14:44.003 --> 3:14:45.087
Why?

3:14:46.631 --> 3:14:48.132
Because they care.

3:14:49.050 --> 3:14:51.302
Because they want to know the truth.

3:14:51.844 --> 3:14:53.971
Because they want their country back.

3:14:54.055 --> 3:14:56.223
Because it still belongs to us...

3:14:56.557 --> 3:15:00.645
...as long as the people have the guts
to fight for what they believe in.

3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:07.318
The truth is the most important value
we have, because if it doesn't endure...

3:15:08.069 --> 3:15:09.987
...if the government murders truth...

3:15:10.071 --> 3:15:12.365
...if we cannot respect these people...

3:15:12.448 --> 3:15:17.495
...then this is not the country I was
born in, or the country I want to die in.

3:15:19.372 --> 3:15:20.665

This was never more true

3:16:06.627 --> 3:16:08.212
Show this world...

3:16:08.671 --> 3:16:13.509
...this is still a government "of the people,
for the people and by the people. "

Nothing as long as you live...

3:16:18.180 --> 3:16:20.224
...will ever be more important.

3:16:23.394 --> 3:16:24.770
It's up to you.

3:16:47.960 --> 3:16:50.087
Has the jury reached a verdict?

3:16:50.671 --> 3:16:51.922
We have, Your Honor.

3:16:52.006 --> 3:16:54.383
Please hand the verdict to the clerk.

3:17:04.018 --> 3:17:06.395
Will the defendant please rise?

3:17:10.524 --> 3:17:12.735
The clerk will now read the verdict.

3:17:13.527 --> 3:17:17.365
"New Orleans, Louisiana. March 1, 1969.

3:17:18.199 --> 3:17:22.995
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Clay Shaw, not guilty. "

3:17:44.684 --> 3:17:46.394
We believe there was a conspiracy.

3:17:46.519 --> 3:17:49.522
Whether Shaw was a part of it
is another kettle of fish.

3:17:49.605 --> 3:17:51.065
There's Jim!

3:17:53.609 --> 3:17:58.572
Do you agree that this is a full vindication
of the Warren Commission?

3:18:00.324 --> 3:18:03.411
It only proves you cannot run
an investigation...

3:18:03.703 --> 3:18:08.332
...questioning the intelligence operations
of the US government.

3:18:08.416 --> 3:18:11.752
People claim you're unfit to hold office...

3:18:12.086 --> 3:18:14.380
...that you've ruined
Clay Shaw's reputation.

3:18:14.505 --> 3:18:15.965
Are you going to resign?

3:18:16.048 --> 3:18:19.635
Hell, no! I'm going to run again,
and I'm going to win!

3:18:20.136 --> 3:18:22.013
Who will you persecute next?

3:18:22.138 --> 3:18:25.224
If it takes me 30 years to nail every one
of the assassins...

3:18:25.308 --> 3:18:27.768
...then I will continue for 30 years!

3:18:28.811 --> 3:18:31.731
I owe that to Jack Kennedy
and the country.

3:18:31.814 --> 3:18:34.108
There's Clay! There's Clay Shaw!

3:18:34.692 --> 3:18:38.195
- How does it feel to be acquitted?
- It's been exhausting.

3:18:38.321 --> 3:18:39.447
What'll you do now?

3:18:39.572 --> 3:18:41.282
I'm going home and cook some étouffée.

3:18:41.407 --> 3:18:43.183
Were you confident about the outcome?

3:18:46.078 --> 3:18:49.582
- Do you think Garrison will be back?
- I'm sure he will.
