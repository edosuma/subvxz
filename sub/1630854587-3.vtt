00:20.416 --> 00:23.125
Son, it's bad enough
to have you living here at home again,

00:23.208 --> 00:26.166
but are you gonna do anything
besides sit on the couch and cry?

00:26.250 --> 00:27.916
I'm not just crying, Dad.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.541
I'm also masturbating.

00:32.791 --> 00:34.708
Sorry, Dad.

00:34.791 --> 00:38.750
Since I lost Gina, crying and masturbating
to porn is all I wanna do.

00:38.833 --> 00:42.125
Well, can you at least wait
until your grandma isn't visiting?

00:42.208 --> 00:45.125
Anyways, don't worry about me, Dad.
I'll get through this.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.416
Your grief, huh?

00:46.500 --> 00:47.583
No. PornHub.

00:47.666 --> 00:50.208
You watched every video on PornHub?

00:50.291 --> 00:51.416
Almost.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.583
I even watched
the animated stuff like <i>Tugrats</i>,

00:53.666 --> 00:55.583
<i>Powerbuff Girls</i>, and <i>Darkwing Cuck</i>.

00:55.666 --> 00:57.375
Those sound a little yucky, son.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.041
You should check out
<i>The Fairly OddParents:</i>

01:00.125 --> 01:01.916
<i>Lust For Big Black Cock</i>.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.583
Here we go. The very last video.

01:07.583 --> 01:08.666
Gina?

01:08.750 --> 01:10.666
Dad! It's Gina!

01:10.750 --> 01:13.083
Hey, there she is. Look at that.

01:13.166 --> 01:16.000
I always knew
that girl would do big things.

01:16.083 --> 01:18.583
Just didn't realize how big.
And how veiny.

01:18.666 --> 01:21.416
Hey, Mom! Get a load of this hog!

01:21.500 --> 01:23.208
That's where she's been!

01:23.291 --> 01:25.250
I'm going to the studio
where they shot this.

01:59.958 --> 02:02.375
Fuck your baked potato!

02:02.458 --> 02:05.916
What the hell?!
The Jiggles are Baby Kevin's favorite!

02:06.000 --> 02:07.500
That music is horseshit!

02:07.583 --> 02:10.208
You obviously know nothing about art.

02:10.291 --> 02:14.041
They wrote the most
life-changing anthem of all time.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.625
"Beep Beep Vroom Vroom Big Red Bus."

02:16.708 --> 02:19.875
Oh, I know
"Beep Beep Vroom Vroom Big Red Bus."

02:19.958 --> 02:23.541
I fucking lived
"Beep Beep Vroom Vroom Big Red Bus"!

02:23.625 --> 02:25.583
What the fuck
are you talking about, Randall?

02:25.666 --> 02:28.750
I never told you
about this dark time in my life, Karen,

02:28.833 --> 02:31.625
but I was actually
a founding member of The Jiggles.

02:31.708 --> 02:34.208
Those assholes kicked me out
before they hit it big,

02:34.291 --> 02:36.750
'cause the songs
I wrote were too damn good.

02:36.833 --> 02:40.166
Stop spewing bullshit, old man.
You weren't a Jiggle.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.583
Well, fuck me in my baby ass.

02:48.666 --> 02:51.500
Daddy, you'd be my hero
if you introduced me to 'em.

02:51.583 --> 02:53.916
Yeah, I could,
but they're probably halfway around the--

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
Actually, they're playing tonight
in Diamond City!

02:57.083 --> 02:59.791
Well, isn't that
very convenient, story-wise.

02:59.875 --> 03:03.791
Of course I could introduce you,
little buddy. Those guys love me!

03:03.875 --> 03:05.250
Why'd they kick you out, then?

03:05.333 --> 03:07.666
I told you. Creative differences.

03:09.708 --> 03:12.916
Bless us with a great show,
Australian Jesus.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.791
Nothing gets me pumped up
for a show like praying to Aussie Jesus.

03:16.875 --> 03:20.250
Well, nothing besides injecting cocaine
right into my penis.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.333
Steve the Squid?

03:23.125 --> 03:24.125
Do the honors.

03:25.791 --> 03:27.833
Whoo! Rock and roll!

03:47.166 --> 03:49.250
Hail Satan!

03:55.916 --> 03:56.916
Dobby Dobby.

03:57.916 --> 04:00.041
Okay, Junior. Time to go.

04:00.125 --> 04:03.500
Now, you go and say goodbye to these,
uh, extras from Troma Entertainment

04:03.583 --> 04:05.875
that I guess we're okay
with you hanging out with.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.541
What the hell?!

04:10.625 --> 04:14.625
Dobby, we told you, don't be spraying
neurotoxin on your friends, now.

04:14.708 --> 04:15.916
A neurotoxin?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.875
Calm down. He'll be fine.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.750
But if his back
starts bubbling like a wet mogwai,

04:20.833 --> 04:23.916
you're gonna wanna burn his body
and bury him under a church.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.916
-What?!
-Robby's just kidding.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.500
You only have to bury him
next to a church.

04:28.583 --> 04:32.250
That's it. Junior, I don't want you
playing with that Dobby freak anymore.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.875
Or that bulimic freak.

04:34.958 --> 04:39.083
Bullet! How dare you insult
my little angel, Jerry.

04:39.166 --> 04:42.083
Your son's the freak,
because you had sex with a dolphin!

04:42.166 --> 04:43.791
Bro, you had sex with the same dolphin!

04:43.875 --> 04:44.875
That's different.

04:44.958 --> 04:46.333
That dolphin's my mother.

04:46.416 --> 04:47.375
Come on, Junior.

04:47.458 --> 04:51.541
I don't wanna see you around these two…
uh, future Gravitron operators ever again.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.458
Yeah, I said it.

04:52.541 --> 04:54.958
Fine. That goes double for Jerry.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.000
And another math word for Dobby.

05:00.541 --> 05:02.750
Oh my God! Did you see that subtitle?

05:02.833 --> 05:04.458
Dobby just said the F-word!

05:04.541 --> 05:06.041
He must have learned that fucking shit

05:06.125 --> 05:09.125
from your little fucking fuckity
fucked-up fucker. Fuck you!

05:11.750 --> 05:13.500
I have <i>wunderbar</i> news, Mayor.

05:13.583 --> 05:16.208
I landed you meetings with several CEOs

05:16.291 --> 05:19.250
about them moving
their headquarters to Paradise.

05:19.750 --> 05:23.750
Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm just so thrilled
you agreed to come meet!

05:28.625 --> 05:32.458
Uh, Paradise would be a great place
for Facebook headquarters and--

05:32.541 --> 05:33.791
Do you like my hair?

05:33.875 --> 05:35.416
Um… Sure?

05:35.500 --> 05:36.791
Need higher hair.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.708
You need…

05:38.791 --> 05:40.208
Higher hair, please.

05:40.291 --> 05:43.458
Are you saying
you want me to cut your hair or…

05:43.541 --> 05:44.875
Need higher hair.

05:45.583 --> 05:48.583
Hello. I need to speak
with to mayor at once.

05:48.666 --> 05:51.875
Ah. I'm sorry.
The mayor is in a very important meeting.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.791
How's that?

05:53.875 --> 05:55.458
-Higher.
-Really?

05:55.541 --> 05:56.791
Need higher hair.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.791
I told you it's urgent!

06:01.125 --> 06:03.041
Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't realize

06:03.125 --> 06:05.750
you were in the middle
of grooming a dead-eyed shark man.

06:05.833 --> 06:06.833
I'll come back.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.166
How did it go?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.750
Well, he's not moving his company here,

06:16.833 --> 06:19.708
but somehow I've agreed
to be his on-call barber.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.166
<i>Need higher hair, please.</i>

06:25.750 --> 06:27.750
Okay. This is The Jiggles' hotel.

06:27.833 --> 06:29.958
You wait here
while I go set everything up.

06:34.041 --> 06:36.416
You sure they're even
gonna let you in to see 'em?

06:36.500 --> 06:38.291
Don't worry. I got a plan.

06:41.208 --> 06:44.458
This horny MILF gave me a BJ
so she can meet you guys.

06:47.041 --> 06:50.041
Man! She's fucking ugly.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.291
Who are you?

06:53.375 --> 06:55.166
Who am I? Duh!

06:55.250 --> 06:57.500
I'm your best pal, Green Jiggle?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.625
You mean the lowlife
we kicked out of the group

06:59.708 --> 07:04.166
because he injected cocaine into his penis
and tried to eat the Purple Jiggle's face?

07:06.250 --> 07:08.750
Yeah, that's me. And I need a favor.

07:08.833 --> 07:11.416
My kid would love to meet you guys.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.583
Better yet, how about you let me
come onstage with you for one song?

07:14.666 --> 07:16.750
Oh, then I'd really be his hero.

07:16.833 --> 07:18.250
What do you think, gang?

07:18.333 --> 07:22.291
Let's teach that koala fucker
a lesson, shall we?

07:34.833 --> 07:37.833
No! No! No, no, no! No!

07:44.416 --> 07:45.708
There's Gina!

07:45.791 --> 07:46.625
Cut!

07:47.625 --> 07:49.208
You guys were awesome up there.

07:49.291 --> 07:51.958
That was my girlfriend
you were fucking. High five!

07:53.083 --> 07:55.250
Gina! I-It's me, Kevin!

07:55.333 --> 07:57.791
You did so good up there.
I didn't know you could act.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.250
Name's not Gina.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.125
I guess it was just movie magic.

08:07.583 --> 08:10.958
Wow. The makeup artist
on this film deserves an award.

08:11.041 --> 08:14.083
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be on set.

08:14.166 --> 08:17.833
<i>Unwanted Redhead Stepchild</i>
<i>Bangs MILF Stepmom,</i>

08:17.916 --> 08:20.791
<i>Hot Titties, Must Watch</i>, take one.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.708
Hey. Just read the cue cards.

08:26.416 --> 08:29.833
Oh no, Mom.
You're stuck in the dryer again.

08:29.916 --> 08:32.791
Aw. It's these damn giant titties.

08:32.875 --> 08:35.833
Your daddy says
he's gonna be coming home late.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.625
Uh-oh. My pants are falling down.

08:43.291 --> 08:47.791
Oh my God!
Why does it have a knuckle? Ew!

08:47.875 --> 08:49.916
-Silence!

08:52.958 --> 08:57.083
Your penis,
it oozes shame from its gaping maw.

08:57.166 --> 08:58.000
Thanks?

08:58.083 --> 09:01.916
To look at it
is to stare into the void of madness.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.416
It is truly the banality
of evil mite flesh.

09:05.500 --> 09:06.833
So should I leave or--

09:06.916 --> 09:11.833
No. I am going to make
your hideously beautiful penis a star.

09:11.916 --> 09:13.375
We have much work to do.

09:13.458 --> 09:14.541
Take five, everyone.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.208
Dobby Dobby.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.875
Higher hair.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.166
Bro-zaniacs,
I know we've got a lot of free time,

09:47.250 --> 09:48.875
and I've got something to fill it.

09:48.958 --> 09:51.291
You're gonna join my new children's band

09:51.375 --> 09:55.583
and help me get revenge on The Jiggles
by becoming more popular than them.

09:55.666 --> 09:59.000
Hold on. I gotta see
how this stepmom gets out of the dryer.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.875
Goop! I'll be the lovable diva
of the group.

10:01.958 --> 10:04.708
Hopson, get me
a fucking espresso, old man!

10:04.791 --> 10:09.333
Twatemala
was Dobby the whole time?!

10:09.416 --> 10:11.833
With my songs, we'll be a huge hit.

10:11.916 --> 10:13.958
And I already booked our first gig.

10:14.041 --> 10:18.208
We're gonna be opening
for the animatronic Possum Pizza Jug Band.

10:18.291 --> 10:21.250
Just gotta get there three hours early
to disassemble the headliner.

10:21.333 --> 10:22.833
You gotta be kidding me, right?

10:22.916 --> 10:25.666
It makes more sense
than when I ate too many shcrump,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.250
shit on the wall,
and became a famous artist.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.458
That never happened.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.833
Oh, that's right.
That's two episodes from now.

10:32.916 --> 10:34.000
Spoiler alert.

10:34.583 --> 10:37.541
Aw, Fitz, don't be such a Grumpy Gus.
It's gonna be great.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.750
I already thought of a cool name
and a cool gimmick.

10:40.833 --> 10:42.666
We're all gonna play fiddles.

10:46.750 --> 10:49.958
Please welcome to the stage,
The Kiddie Fiddlers.

10:53.708 --> 10:55.791
Randall, that name sounds a little creepy.

10:55.875 --> 10:58.208
Especially since you forgot
to bring the damn fiddles.

10:58.291 --> 11:02.041
Relax, Fitz. They'll realize
there's nothing untoward about us.

11:02.125 --> 11:05.041
Especially once they hear my song
about the shy bear

11:05.125 --> 11:08.291
who's trying to get the bee's honey
from the hole in the tree.

11:23.333 --> 11:27.166
Who the hell arrested us? This town
doesn't even have a goddamn police force!

11:27.250 --> 11:29.000
I don't know, but we deserved it

11:29.083 --> 11:32.125
because all the creepy-ass songs
you made us sing!

11:32.208 --> 11:33.375
What do you mean, creepy?

11:33.458 --> 11:35.875
"Stick My Finger
in the Yummy Little Bee Hole."

11:35.958 --> 11:38.083
Nobody calls a beehive a bee hole!

11:38.166 --> 11:41.041
What? My songs are completely innocent.

11:41.125 --> 11:44.875
Like the one about me cheering up
a young shellfish going through chemo.

11:44.958 --> 11:49.083
The song is called "I Wanna Play
with That Hairless Little Clam"!

11:49.166 --> 11:50.375
Catchy, eh?

11:50.458 --> 11:52.958
The songs ain't the problem.
The musicians are.

11:53.041 --> 11:54.500
We just need more practice.

11:54.583 --> 11:55.416
Right, Hopson?

11:55.916 --> 11:58.791
-Hopson!
-Polyp took over Chief's body!

11:58.875 --> 12:00.750
We don't care about all that.

12:00.833 --> 12:06.166
My rider clearly states that I must have
a single green M&M backstage,

12:06.250 --> 12:07.916
and I didn't get one.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.500
Luckily, I brought my own.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.166
Help me! He's eating my brain!

12:16.250 --> 12:18.125
It's so nice to meet you.

12:18.208 --> 12:19.541
-Mayor, I need to--

12:20.416 --> 12:23.375
Okay. Maybe another time, then.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.916
Anyway. Hi.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.458
Hi. I'm Michael Lindell.

12:29.541 --> 12:31.125
And this is My Pillow.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.583
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Lindell.

12:33.666 --> 12:35.833
A-Aren't you gonna say hi to My Pillow?

12:36.916 --> 12:38.625
Uh… H-Hi, Mr. Pillow.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.875
My Pillow doesn't like your face.

12:41.958 --> 12:43.625
-What?
-Nothing.

12:43.708 --> 12:44.958
Uh… Okay.

12:45.041 --> 12:47.916
I think you'll find
that our town has a lot to offer.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.833
I smoked crack once!

12:49.916 --> 12:52.333
But it wasn't my fault.
My Pillow made me do it.

12:52.416 --> 12:53.625
It's fine with me.

12:53.708 --> 12:57.375
Honestly, if you move your company here,
I'd be willing to fluff both of you.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.000
Really.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.958
Ugh. You are a sick, sick woman.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.958
Come on, My Pillow.
Let's go masturbate in Mother's coffin.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.375
Paradise Party Dudes
<i>is brought to you by My Pillow.</i>

13:09.458 --> 13:12.333
<i>My Pillow! Fuck it in your mom's coffin.</i>

13:15.000 --> 13:17.583
So why is that stepmom stuck
in the dryer again?

13:17.666 --> 13:19.458
It's those damn big titties.

13:19.541 --> 13:21.416
I think she can sue that dryer company.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.500
-Fuck you, door!

13:23.583 --> 13:26.333
I mean, I offered to open it
for you, but here we are.

13:26.416 --> 13:27.791
Jerry and Junior are missing.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.416
We're hoping they came here.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.625
Oh, man.
I-I'll ask Dobby if he's seen 'em.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.666
Fuck you, door!

13:34.750 --> 13:36.250
You are hard to be around.

13:36.333 --> 13:37.333
Where is he?

13:37.416 --> 13:38.250
Look! A note.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.833
"Dobby Dobby, Dobby Dobby…"

13:40.916 --> 13:42.750
-Hey, what's that word, man?
-Dobby.

13:42.833 --> 13:45.041
Oh shit! They ran away!

13:47.291 --> 13:49.791
I'm so excited to be in my first porno!

13:50.500 --> 13:51.750
When do the girls get here?

13:51.833 --> 13:53.125
There will be no girls.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.291
Okay. Guys. The original girls.

13:56.375 --> 13:58.208
There will be no sex.

13:58.291 --> 14:01.250
If I owned a Proto-Cubist Picasso,

14:01.333 --> 14:04.208
I wouldn't shove it up
somebody's worn-out anus!

14:04.291 --> 14:07.083
No sex? What kinda porno is this?

14:13.416 --> 14:17.750
This film is an auteur's dream
come to fruition.

14:17.833 --> 14:20.625
And the most important piece
of cinematic art

14:20.708 --> 14:23.250
of this or any generation.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.375
There are vomit bags
in the seat pockets in front of you.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.875
<i>Pain. Suffering. Angst.</i>

14:34.916 --> 14:35.750
<i>But why?</i>

14:37.041 --> 14:40.125
<i>-God is truly dead.</i>

14:49.375 --> 14:52.250
They liked it!
I can't believe they liked it.

14:52.333 --> 14:53.416
Who the hell are you?

15:09.750 --> 15:12.375
Thanks for picking me up
from prison, Camaro Bob.

15:12.458 --> 15:14.875
No problem, TransAm Terry.

15:14.958 --> 15:19.125
Too bad you had to do 20 years
for killing those kids in the woods, baby.

15:19.208 --> 15:20.291
I don't know. I just…

15:20.375 --> 15:22.875
There's something about a group
of kids coming of age in the woods

15:22.958 --> 15:23.958
that sets me off.

15:24.708 --> 15:25.583
Wait a minute.

15:25.666 --> 15:26.791
Stop the car!

15:29.458 --> 15:32.000
-Oh no. Here we go.

15:32.083 --> 15:35.625
You kids over there coming of age?
In the woods?!

15:37.375 --> 15:40.041
Yes, you are coming of age in the woods.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.625
You kids are dead!

15:41.708 --> 15:45.041
You sure you wanna go back
to prison so soon, baby?

15:45.125 --> 15:47.083
No choice.

15:47.166 --> 15:51.416
Terry don't care if you go in the woods.
Terry don't care if you come of age.

15:51.500 --> 15:56.458
But if you do those two things at once,
it makes Terry inexplicably angry!

15:56.541 --> 15:59.958
I guess I can relate,
but instead of kids, it's lonely MILFs.

16:00.041 --> 16:03.125
And instead of the woods,
it's the back room of a yoga studio.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.208
And instead of coming of age,
it's them squirting on my…

16:06.291 --> 16:10.333
Uh-oh. I just got wound up
and busted half a nut, baby.

16:12.083 --> 16:15.041
Band practice started ten hours ago!

16:15.125 --> 16:19.541
Where's Dusty, that dumbo-sized diva?
At least he can carry a tune.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.916
Unlike you, Hopson, you talentless prick.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.791
I got talent.
I know how to play the rusty trombone.

16:25.875 --> 16:29.208
Yeah, Hopson, I don't have time
for your perverted bullshit.

16:29.291 --> 16:32.208
What? That fella
at the music store gave it to me.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.583
Oh. Well, my bad, Hopson. I thought
you were about to say something--

16:35.666 --> 16:38.750
As payment for eating his ass
while jerking him off.

16:38.833 --> 16:40.208
You just got Hopson'd.

16:43.833 --> 16:46.833
Randall, if you're gonna force us
to keep doing this,

16:46.916 --> 16:50.208
can we at least come up
with a non-creepy kids' song?

16:50.291 --> 16:52.416
Sure! I got a whole book full of 'em.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.458
Check this one out.

16:53.541 --> 16:57.166
It's about a clumsy juggler
and his fickle fans.

17:14.208 --> 17:16.083
Are you trying to get put on a list?!

17:17.583 --> 17:19.000
Kiddie Fiddlers' booking.

17:19.083 --> 17:21.375
Really? That's great news!

17:21.458 --> 17:23.750
Ha ha! Fitz, you're so full of shit.

17:23.833 --> 17:26.916
I just booked us a gig
at Philadelphia Fest.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.500
Ha! Told you my songs were good.

17:29.125 --> 17:31.916
Look, y'all! I'm dating Yoko Ono!

17:32.000 --> 17:34.208
Just like that Beetlejuice
named Don Lemon.

17:34.291 --> 17:36.458
She thinks
I'm way more talented than y'all.

17:36.541 --> 17:38.125
She thinks I should go solo.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.791
She even wrote me a song.

17:39.875 --> 17:40.916
Sing it for 'em, babe.

17:43.625 --> 17:47.125
I broke up The Beatles!

17:50.625 --> 17:54.708
And this year's award
for Weirdest Dick goes to…

17:54.791 --> 17:56.958
…AFKAK Crawford!

18:01.000 --> 18:05.541
It was just an honor to be nominated
with the likes of Carl Corkscrew Cock,

18:05.625 --> 18:08.666
Freddy Fork Phallus, and Ethan Hawke.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.000
-Thank you!

18:11.083 --> 18:13.791
AFKAK, I would love
to shoot a sex scene with you.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.791
I have got a fetish for ungodly penises.

18:16.875 --> 18:20.958
No kidding?
I feel like such a man.

18:21.041 --> 18:23.000
Let-- let me go ask permission.

18:23.958 --> 18:27.375
The hottest porn star on earth
wants to shoot a sex scene with me.

18:27.458 --> 18:31.250
I will never let my wailing atrocity
come near a woman.

18:31.333 --> 18:35.291
Please. I've shot 70 films,
and I haven't had sex with one woman.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.333
I can't even cash any checks
because they're all made out to my dick.

18:38.416 --> 18:40.250
Okay. One scene.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.541
But you have to sign this contract.
It says I own your penis,

18:43.625 --> 18:46.041
and when I die, I will be buried with it.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.125
Sounds fair.

18:47.208 --> 18:49.875
Wow. Best Makeup Artist.

18:49.958 --> 18:52.541
I'd like to thank my English teacher,
Mr. Toomie,

18:52.625 --> 18:54.500
who always said, if I put my mind to it,

18:54.583 --> 18:58.291
I could deceive people
into jerking off to a bag of rats.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.041
All the love, Mr. Toomie.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.291
I hope you can see this in prison.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.291
My goals are to become
the richest man on earth,

19:06.375 --> 19:09.750
attain world domination,
enslave my workers, and defeat Superman.

19:09.833 --> 19:11.041
I'm sorry, Mr. Luthor,

19:11.125 --> 19:15.500
but I'm not sure that we want
an evil company like LexCorp in Paradise.

19:15.583 --> 19:18.125
Oh. I'm not Lex Luthor. I'm Jeff Bezos.

19:18.208 --> 19:20.833
Oh! I love <i>Bosch</i>. Welcome to Paradise.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.666
That wasn't Lex Luthor!
That was Jeff Bezos!

19:28.750 --> 19:30.166
I know. You're welcome.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.750
Meeting adjourned, Your Honor?

19:34.833 --> 19:36.083
What the hell do you want?

19:36.166 --> 19:38.833
Aren't you Fitz's
incompetent psychiatrist?

19:38.916 --> 19:42.458
I found that I can be incompetent
at lots of things.

19:42.541 --> 19:45.500
I now represent Charles Lovely,

19:45.583 --> 19:51.541
the CEO of Lovely Corp,
a multi-billion-dollar company.

19:51.625 --> 19:56.166
He wants to move
his entire enterprise to Paradise.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.208
That's great. When do I get to meet him?

20:00.291 --> 20:01.125
Now.

20:02.708 --> 20:06.500
Hello. I am Charles Lovely.

20:07.875 --> 20:09.041
Sorry about your plant.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.083
Oh, it's fine. That plant was a cunt.

20:15.291 --> 20:18.041
Ugh. Where the hell are those kids?

20:18.125 --> 20:20.416
You're a dog!
Can't you pick up their scent?

20:20.500 --> 20:23.708
Bro, do you know
how much blow I do?

20:23.791 --> 20:25.958
It is… It's all dead up there.
I can't smell shit.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.291
Then how do we even know
they went this way?!

20:28.375 --> 20:31.083
All kids go down these tracks
when they run away.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.791
Hey, Delbert.
Remember when we ran away in '86?

20:33.875 --> 20:36.916
Yep. Us, Mouth from <i>The Goonies</i>,
fat Jerry O'Connell,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.291
and that boy from <i>Star Trek</i>
who got the leech on his pecker.

20:39.375 --> 20:40.375
Oh yeah. That's right.

20:40.458 --> 20:42.833
We never did get to fuck
that dead body, though.

20:42.916 --> 20:45.416
We were trying to <i>find</i> a dead body.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.750
Maybe <i>you</i> were.

20:52.416 --> 20:53.250
Oh, hey, honey.

20:53.333 --> 20:56.500
These are for you.
I'm so excited for our shoot today.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.208
Believe it or not,
I have a pretty weird-shaped vagina.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.916
I have to use Waze
to put in a tampon.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.375
See you on set.

21:04.458 --> 21:07.125
Okay. Better get my costume on.

21:11.958 --> 21:13.083
Ow!

21:13.750 --> 21:17.000
Stupid bee! Go back
to your yummy little bee hole!

21:18.708 --> 21:21.375
<i>Wankenstein</i>, take one.

21:21.458 --> 21:23.500
Take me, Wankenstein.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.416
Don't be afraid of fire…

21:25.500 --> 21:26.583
crotch!

21:26.666 --> 21:28.916
I wrote that.
It's like improv or whatever.

21:29.000 --> 21:32.250
Fire crotch good.

21:35.166 --> 21:38.958
You're a fucking fraud.
You have a thick, beautiful penis!

21:39.041 --> 21:41.041
No! I-I swear, I don't!

21:41.125 --> 21:43.666
I am not putting anything that gorgeous

21:43.750 --> 21:46.583
and perfectly formed
and basic inside of me.

21:46.666 --> 21:50.250
I want a Buscemi, not a Hemsworth. Gross.

21:51.125 --> 21:52.375
No! No!

21:53.041 --> 21:54.166
What have you done?

21:54.250 --> 21:56.666
You have wiped your ass
with the <i>Mona Lisa</i>.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.125
What do I have to live for?

22:02.666 --> 22:04.000
No!

22:05.333 --> 22:08.083
Well, at least now
I have a thick, beautiful--

22:10.833 --> 22:13.750
Damn it. Back to Buscemi.

22:16.125 --> 22:19.916
Okay, guys. Gonna start with that new one.
The one about me and my puppet named Jack.

22:20.000 --> 22:20.958
Where's the puppet?

22:21.041 --> 22:25.083
Well, I forgot the damn puppet, okay?
But we're doing the song anyway. Let's go!

22:39.291 --> 22:40.458
Hoo! We're killing!

22:40.541 --> 22:42.541
Let's do the one
about the son helping his dad out

22:42.625 --> 22:44.166
with odd jobs around the house.

23:07.208 --> 23:08.125
Big finish!

23:08.208 --> 23:11.583
Time for the one about the boy whose dad
is telling him all about growing up.

23:11.666 --> 23:14.333
Can't you give this context
to the audience?

23:14.416 --> 23:15.416
No time. Hit it!

23:57.458 --> 24:00.083
See, Fitz? I told you my songs were good.

24:02.541 --> 24:05.833
What the hell?
This audience is all creepy pervs.

24:05.916 --> 24:06.958
Look at that!

24:07.750 --> 24:10.541
Yeah. "Philadelphia Fest."
And your point is?

24:10.625 --> 24:13.083
That says "Pedophilia Fest"!

24:13.166 --> 24:14.500
Oh shit.

24:14.583 --> 24:18.125
I guess I've been mixing up
those two words my whole life.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.416
No wonder the guy
at the deli looks at me weird

24:20.500 --> 24:23.125
when I ask for pedophilia cream cheese.

24:23.208 --> 24:25.333
I guess my songs do suck.

24:25.416 --> 24:26.666
Great show, Dad.

24:26.750 --> 24:30.833
You're even better than The Jiggles.
You're my hero.

24:30.916 --> 24:34.250
My son likes my songs,
and that's all that matters.

24:34.333 --> 24:37.958
And he's about to get molested
by a thousand pedophiles!

24:39.125 --> 24:41.666
Get outta my--

24:41.750 --> 24:43.500
Wait, aren't you R. Kelly?

24:43.583 --> 24:46.916
My Pillow made me come here.

24:49.833 --> 24:53.458
You sure you don't wanna make it home
to finally meet your 19-year-old daughter

24:53.541 --> 24:55.291
before you go back to prison?

24:55.375 --> 24:59.916
I did. Until these three decided
to come of age in the woods.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.875
Now I gotta kill them!

25:11.083 --> 25:13.458
Oh ho ho. Oh…

25:13.541 --> 25:15.791
You three are in trouble now.

25:15.875 --> 25:20.291
Nobody bites Terry's hand off,
balls off, and face off

25:20.375 --> 25:22.166
at the same time!

25:24.000 --> 25:27.166
Hey, you guys look different now.
More mature.

25:27.250 --> 25:28.708
You came of age.

25:28.791 --> 25:29.958
Holy shit!

25:30.041 --> 25:32.583
I was the adversity you had to overcome!

25:32.666 --> 25:34.458
I made you come of age!

25:34.541 --> 25:35.833
In the woods!

25:35.916 --> 25:38.916
Who-- who am I?! What am I?!

25:41.208 --> 25:43.250
Let's get you home, baby.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.000
And don't worry about that new face.

25:46.083 --> 25:51.500
I know a lot of horny MILFs stuck
in dryers with a Crypt Keeper fetish.

25:54.541 --> 25:57.166
Wow. They really care about each other.

25:57.250 --> 26:00.083
We were wrong
to keep them apart.

26:00.166 --> 26:02.541
Maybe we should've stepped in
and stopped that whole thing

26:02.625 --> 26:04.083
when we got here 20 minutes ago.

26:04.166 --> 26:06.833
Are you nuts? That guy had a knife.

26:06.916 --> 26:10.166
<i>I'll never forget that summer</i>
<i>we ran away from home,</i>

26:10.250 --> 26:12.666
<i>went into the woods, and came of age.</i>

26:12.750 --> 26:15.541
<i>As we grew older,</i>
<i>it was harder to stay in touch.</i>

26:15.625 --> 26:17.250
<i>Junior became an astronaut</i>

26:17.333 --> 26:21.166
<i>and the first dolphin-dog</i>
<i>to die in space from a heroin overdose.</i>

26:21.250 --> 26:23.916
<i>Jerry tried several times</i>
<i>to get into the army,</i>

26:24.000 --> 26:27.875
<i>but his weird, fucked up face,</i>
<i>fins, and blowhole kept him out.</i>

26:27.958 --> 26:31.291
<i>Fortunately, he moved to Kentucky</i>
<i>and became the Senate Majority Leader.</i>

26:31.375 --> 26:33.958
<i>And as for me, I became a writer.</i>

26:35.291 --> 26:37.458
Dad, can we go now?
