WEBVTT

00:04.504 --> 00:05.629
What is it?

00:05.797 --> 00:08.048
Nothing. I can't find anything
that I want to eat.

00:08.216 --> 00:09.550
Everything makes me nauseous.

00:09.759 --> 00:12.553
I'm telling you, being pregnant
is no piece of cake. Oh, cake.

00:14.347 --> 00:15.764
No.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.892
- Aw, honey, I'm sorry.
- God.

00:19.060 --> 00:23.731
Ooh, what is that smell?
It's coming from the bathroom.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.151
Wow, pregnancy does give you
some weird cravings.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.862
- Yeah.
- It's me. It's Phoebe.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.990
Listen, there's something in here
I want to eat. What?

00:33.950 --> 00:36.118
What smells so good?

00:36.911 --> 00:39.371
Is it the shampoo? It's guava.

00:39.539 --> 00:40.748
No.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.916
- Ugh.
- Oh, wait, wait.

00:43.918 --> 00:45.961
Is it my bologna sandwich?

00:48.298 --> 00:50.174
Yes, yes, yes.

00:50.341 --> 00:53.343
I can't believe it. The baby wants bologna.
The baby wants me to eat meat.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.263
- I can't eat meat.
- Uh, wait, wait.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.058
Maybe it's the pickle.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.528
What are you writing?

01:52.695 --> 01:54.154
Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow...

01:54.322 --> 01:56.865
...and since I don't have the guts
to ask him out...

01:57.033 --> 01:59.701
...I'm gonna sell him a coat
and put this note in the pocket.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.328
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh.

02:01.496 --> 02:05.749
"Joshua, give me a call sometime.
Guys like you...

02:05.917 --> 02:08.335
...never go out of style."

02:09.253 --> 02:11.505
What did you throw away?

02:13.508 --> 02:16.552
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, what have you guys been up to?

02:16.719 --> 02:20.806
Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian
doorknobs at the Cooper-Hewitt museum.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.432
Without me?

02:24.144 --> 02:27.229
My uncle dragged us there,
but actually it turned out to be interesting.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.731
- Yeah.
- They were so ornate and beautiful.

02:29.899 --> 02:30.941
I mean, look at that.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.776
I don't know how museums work
in England...

02:32.944 --> 02:35.529
...but here,
you're not supposed to take stuff.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.448
I, uh... I got it from the gift shop.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.492
They have really lax security there.

02:42.203 --> 02:43.662
It's a joke.

02:45.081 --> 02:46.373
Bye.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.295
Right, I've got to be off. I'll see you.
Bye-bye, then.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.130
Bye.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.300
Wow. Hey, you guys seem
to be having a good time.

02:56.467 --> 03:00.762
Oh, yeah, she is amazing,
and she's so much fun.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.641
And you know what?
When I'm with her, I'm fun.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.896
I even signed up for helicopter classes.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.316
She's leaving in two days.
I don't have to do it.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.736
- Aw, two days? You must be bummed.
- Yeah.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.487
She's got to go back to London.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.324
But you know what?
I've been prepared for this from the start.

03:20.491 --> 03:24.036
We both knew we had two weeks
together and then that's it, you know?

03:24.204 --> 03:26.788
Hey, that's what all
my relationships are like.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.918
Yes, but in Ross' case,
they both know in two weeks that's it.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.088
Pheebs, hey.

03:35.256 --> 03:37.841
- Hello, hello.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.054
So the baby is totally craving meat.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.764
This afternoon, I tried tricking it.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.808
I made it a soy burger
so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.186
You know? And I got nauseous.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.522
Well, maybe that's because
soy burgers suck.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.776
Being pregnant is hard on your tummy.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.820
Hey, but at least you got
that cool, pregnant-lady glow.

03:58.988 --> 04:02.282
Oh, that's sweat. You throw up all morning,
you'll have that glow too.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.794
- Okay.
- Uh, here's that trench coat you wanted.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.837
Oh, great. Great.

04:16.255 --> 04:18.798
- Wow, yeah, it's comfortable.
- Yeah.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.302
Man, you could really
flash somebody in this thing.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.055
Ha, ha. They don't want you to put
your hands in the pockets...

04:25.223 --> 04:27.349
...until you are out of the store.

04:28.434 --> 04:29.476
Why not?

04:29.644 --> 04:31.478
Well, because...

04:31.646 --> 04:33.897
...we get a lot of...

04:36.276 --> 04:37.901
You know, they ruin it for everybody.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.444
I know.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.072
You know, I wore that cashmere sweater
on a date last night.

04:43.032 --> 04:46.243
- Oh.
- It was the first date since the divorce.

04:47.036 --> 04:50.330
Well, congratulations.
So do you love her?

04:51.082 --> 04:53.750
No, no, no. She's nice,
but, you know, it made me realize...

04:53.918 --> 04:57.004
...I'm just not ready to be dating,
you know?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.381
Huh.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.925
Well, uh...

05:02.093 --> 05:04.177
That's, uh... That's interesting.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.721
Hey, whoa, hey.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.932
- What was that?
- Oh, that's just an antitheft device.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.310
Then what's this?

05:11.477 --> 05:15.731
Well, you need that too, because
obviously a thief could just tear this up.

05:21.070 --> 05:22.654
Listen, we have to have a party tonight.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.866
We have to have one in five minutes,
so everybody cancel your plans.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.243
- What?
- Yeah, what's going on?

05:28.411 --> 05:31.496
We have to have a surprise
bon-voyage party for Emily.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.874
But it's actually for Joshua.

05:34.834 --> 05:37.294
Look, he said he's not ready to date.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.630
So I had to invite him to a party
if I wanted to see him outside work.

05:40.798 --> 05:45.635
And now I have created
the perfect opportunity to seduce him.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.639
Well, as much as I'd like
to meet Josh and warn him...

05:51.601 --> 05:53.560
...Emily and I aren't gonna be here,
all right?

05:53.728 --> 05:55.687
She's gonna come by first
to say goodbye.

05:55.855 --> 05:59.941
And then I've got a whole special
evening planned. So sorry. No party.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.735
Aw.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.530
- Hello?
- Surprise!

06:06.908 --> 06:08.784
Surprise!

06:10.453 --> 06:13.038
No one's ever thrown me
a surprise party before.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.166
Well, it was all Ross' idea.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.836
You're so sweet.

06:20.338 --> 06:22.297
And I'm so surprised.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.928
You really didn't know?

06:34.685 --> 06:36.436
There's dancin'

06:36.646 --> 06:38.105
Behind movie scenes

06:38.272 --> 06:41.066
Why are you over here
if Joshua's all the way over there?

06:41.234 --> 06:43.985
Uh, because I'm trying to play
hard-to-get.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.073
Oh, quick. He's looking over here.
Say something funny.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.283
- Like what?
- Ha-ha-ha.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.495
What's so funny?

06:55.456 --> 06:56.540
I said, "Like what?"

06:58.543 --> 07:00.335
Now that's a thinker.

07:01.504 --> 07:04.423
Okay, you know what? This
playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.592
Uh, hand me those cherries. Okay.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.927
Okay.

07:13.683 --> 07:14.808
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:14.976 --> 07:17.310
- Care for a cherry?
- No, thanks.

07:17.478 --> 07:21.690
You know, I can tie one of these into a knot
using just my tongue.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.204
You okay?

07:36.831 --> 07:38.248
You all right?

07:43.212 --> 07:45.464
So we should probably get going soon.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.300
Oh, but the party's only
just getting started.

07:48.468 --> 07:52.095
Yeah, but we have to be at The Four
Seasons for drinks in, oh, 15 minutes.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.473
And then, uh, you know,
then the Plaza for dinner.

07:54.932 --> 07:57.392
So why did you plan a party
at the same time?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.604
No, no, no. Ha, ha.

08:02.231 --> 08:06.485
Actually, American surprise parties
are very short.

08:06.652 --> 08:10.989
It's usually, "Surprise!" Then,
"Oh, my God, I'm so surprised. Goodbye."

08:13.117 --> 08:15.368
Ross, I'm having such a great time.

08:15.536 --> 08:19.247
Your sister has just been telling me that
you used to dressed up like old ladies...

08:19.415 --> 08:21.875
...and host make-believe tea parties.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.672
Monica said that, did she?

08:28.633 --> 08:31.927
Oh, yeah. Then what are you going
to put on top of that?

08:32.094 --> 08:35.429
- A little salami.
- Ooh, yeah. Yeah.

08:36.890 --> 08:38.975
Then, um, what goes on top
of the salami?

08:39.644 --> 08:41.561
- Pastrami.
- Oh, yeah.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.608
You're a genius.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.987
Can someone give me a hand
with the zipper.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.116
Up.

08:57.912 --> 09:01.540
- You changed?
- Yeah, I just needed my lucky dress.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.334
- And "lucky" means "more cleavage"?
- Does for me.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.014
Oh, God, look at him. He's so cute.

09:18.182 --> 09:20.850
I just want to go over there and grab him
and kiss him.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.478
How could I kiss him
without letting him know that I like him?

09:23.646 --> 09:26.898
Hey, I know how you can get him.
Take off your bra.

09:27.817 --> 09:28.858
What?

09:29.026 --> 09:31.069
- There was a scene in Footloose...
- Flashdance.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.823
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, with that plumber girl?
- She was a welder.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.160
Were you, like, in the movie?

09:41.539 --> 09:44.708
Anyway, she takes off her bra
under the shirt...

09:44.875 --> 09:46.418
...and pulls it out the sleeve.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.129
Very sexy. And classy.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.552
Or if you wanna kiss him,
um, you could use mistletoe.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.803
It's not Christmas.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.805
- Or spin the bottle.
- And he's not 11.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.687
Thank you so much for this.
It was really so thoughtful of you.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.105
You're leaving?

10:07.273 --> 10:11.109
- Yes, we have something we have to get to.
- Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna take off too.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.195
No, you guys, you can't leave yet.
You have to stay.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.032
We've got the whole big thing planned.

10:17.658 --> 10:18.742
What big thing?

10:18.909 --> 10:21.036
So, Spin-The-Bottle
works like this.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.704
I spin the bottle.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.624
Lands on Gunther,
so I would have to kiss Gunther.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.418
All right.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.463
Who wants to go first?

10:31.631 --> 10:32.922
I'll go.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.263
Welcome to America.

10:42.391 --> 10:43.642
Oh.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.019
All right.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.521
Oh, my God.

10:48.689 --> 10:52.359
Oh, my gosh. Two in a row.
You gotta use your tongues now.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.783
All right.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.119
What are the odds? What are the odds?

11:05.039 --> 11:07.540
Okay, that's enough, you know. Ha, ha.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.752
Let's let someone else play.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.923
Hey, if you didn't want to play,
then why'd you come to the party?

11:16.884 --> 11:18.426
Okay, my turn.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.682
Oh! Look at that.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.475
Oh, my God.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.730
Oh, my God. The baby just kicked.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.943
It's okay, it's okay.
If it kicked once, it'll kick again.

11:38.781 --> 11:43.284
All right, well, everybody just remember
where they were sitting.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.045
It was a bug.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.591
It doesn't matter
how much I'm craving it.

11:58.759 --> 12:02.220
You know why I'm never gonna eat meat?
Because it's cold-blooded murder.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.556
Okay.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.355
There's a Phoebe on my sandwich.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.525
Phoebe, what are you doing?

12:15.693 --> 12:17.944
I can't help it.

12:18.112 --> 12:21.030
I need the meat.
The baby needs the meat.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.241
You know how when
you're dating someone...

12:23.409 --> 12:26.995
...and you don't want to cheat on them
unless it's with someone really hot?

12:29.582 --> 12:32.000
- Yeah, totally.
- All right, okay.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.752
Well, this is the same kind of deal.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.671
If you're gonna do something wrong...

12:38.340 --> 12:39.382
...do it right.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.640
Feel better?

12:47.808 --> 12:49.976
Yeah, but at what cost?

12:50.936 --> 12:52.979
Six more months, three meals a day?

12:53.147 --> 12:57.108
I'm gonna eat like, you know,
millions of cows.

12:58.903 --> 13:02.572
Hey, what if I said I could even things out
for you, meat-wise?

13:02.740 --> 13:04.949
- What?
- Well, I eat a lot of meat, right?

13:05.117 --> 13:08.036
- Yeah.
- But suppose, until the baby's born...

13:08.204 --> 13:09.412
...I laid off it.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.957
No extra animals would die.
You'd just be eating my animals.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.503
Joey, I can't believe
you'd do that for me.

13:16.670 --> 13:20.673
Absolutely. I could be a vegetarian.

13:20.841 --> 13:23.343
There's no meat in beer, right?

13:23.886 --> 13:26.429
Okay, we can still make dinner
if we skip the appetizers...

13:26.597 --> 13:28.765
...and ask for our check right away.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.980
We can't go now. Looks like Rachel
is going to put on a skit.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.777
Oh, my God. Have you lost your mind?

13:41.570 --> 13:44.280
No, no, no. I am finally thinking clearly.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.201
My lucky dress wasn't working out
too well for me.

13:48.369 --> 13:51.788
But for four years,
this baby never missed.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.999
Rachel, wait, I can't let...

13:55.251 --> 13:57.460
Actually, I kind of want to see
what happens.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.216
Nice, uh, costume.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.676
Oh, yeah.

14:04.844 --> 14:09.180
Well, I wanted to give Emily
a big American goodbye cheer.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.600
So okay. Whoo!

14:14.770 --> 14:17.063
Ready. Okay.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.857
- Give me an "E."
- E.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.650
- Give me an "M."
- M.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.443
- Give me an "I."
- I.

14:22.611 --> 14:23.778
- Give me an "L."
- L.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.613
- Give me a "Y."
- Y.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.615
What do you get?

14:27.783 --> 14:30.159
Oh! Emily.

14:30.327 --> 14:32.161
Whoo! Emily.

14:35.332 --> 14:38.376
Okay. That's me as a cheerleader. Ta-da!

14:40.504 --> 14:42.255
- You all right?
- I just loosened a tooth.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.299
It's no big deal. I have a dentist, you know?

14:44.466 --> 14:47.218
I'm gonna go put some ice on it.
Excuse me.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.848
- What do I do now? What do I do now?
- I think you're done.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.143
Okay, time to take off the bra.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.317
Uh, that was really great.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.944
But I got to take off, actually.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.072
Take the bra off.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.328
All right, come on,
let's go get your coat.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.621
Okay.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.374
Rachel's my girlfriend.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.380
So this was really fun.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.257
Oh, yeah, it was real fun.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.306
You know, this bra...

15:35.935 --> 15:38.269
...is really bothering me.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.481
You know, this used to be my bedroom.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.149
Yeah.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.695
A lot of memories in here. Lot of memories.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.239
If these walls could talk,
you know what they'd say?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.742
"Want to hear some memories?"

15:59.208 --> 16:00.583
Need a...? Need a little hand there?

16:00.751 --> 16:02.794
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I got this all under control.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.298
You really don't seem like you do.

16:12.221 --> 16:16.724
God. Forget it! Oh, this is...

16:19.061 --> 16:22.105
This is not how
this was supposed to happen.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.690
What was supposed to happen?

16:25.734 --> 16:27.610
Can you not look at me when I say this?

16:31.907 --> 16:35.368
I thought that if I could get you here...

16:36.745 --> 16:38.746
...I could seduce you.

16:43.502 --> 16:48.297
Uh, I don't wear suits to work...

16:48.465 --> 16:51.009
...and I bought six of them from you.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.929
Well, I'm sorry.
I thought you needed them.

16:56.515 --> 17:00.518
My point is, I kept coming back
because I wanted to see you.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.855
- Why?
- Because I like you.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.566
You like me?

17:06.817 --> 17:08.108
Yeah.

17:08.277 --> 17:13.031
I mean, you're beautiful
and smart and sophisticated.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.324
A lot of this isn't, you know,
based on tonight.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.662
But you like me?

17:20.039 --> 17:24.000
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.
All this time, I liked you and you liked me.

17:24.167 --> 17:25.209
Oh!

17:26.295 --> 17:28.046
- But...
- No don't say "but."

17:28.213 --> 17:32.675
"But" is never good. Let's leave it
at "I like you and you like me."

17:33.802 --> 17:35.136
Okay, uh...

17:35.304 --> 17:38.139
- However...
- No, that's a fancy "but."

17:40.309 --> 17:44.479
My marriage, like, just ended.

17:44.646 --> 17:48.858
And I'm really not ready
to get into anything yet.

17:50.027 --> 17:51.778
But...

17:53.947 --> 17:57.116
I'm sorry. I just need a little time.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.455
Okay.

18:06.543 --> 18:09.337
Oh, there you are.
I was looking for you before.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.548
Joshua's gone,
so you and Emily are free to go.

18:12.966 --> 18:14.467
It's okay.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.512
She's still in there
enjoying her fake party.

18:17.679 --> 18:21.808
And, uh, it's too late to do
any of the stuff I had planned, so...

18:22.643 --> 18:24.185
Ross.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.604
I'm sorry.
I completely ruined your evening.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.648
Ahem. Yeah.

18:30.442 --> 18:34.237
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
I made a fool of myself.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.073
Helps a little.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.036
Is there a room on that step
for a pathetic loser?

18:42.204 --> 18:44.205
Yeah, have a seat.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.713
I'm so sorry.

18:52.881 --> 18:53.923
It's okay.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.093
I mean, it was just a two-week thing
anyway.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.720
I just didn't want it to end this way,
you know.

18:59.888 --> 19:02.306
Or maybe you didn't want it to end?

19:03.475 --> 19:05.143
What do you mean?

19:05.310 --> 19:07.728
You seem to really like her.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.774
Yeah, I really do.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.027
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

19:15.195 --> 19:17.780
We both agreed it was gonna be
a two-week thing.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.782
You know? No commitment.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.077
Ross?

19:24.246 --> 19:28.916
That girl just spent the entire evening
talking to your friends...

19:29.084 --> 19:31.669
...asking to hear stories about you...

19:31.837 --> 19:34.422
...looking through
Monica's photo albums.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.675
I mean, you don't do that
if you're just in it for two weeks.

19:38.468 --> 19:39.969
You think?

19:41.263 --> 19:45.892
You've got, like, 14 hours
until she has to be at the airport.

19:46.059 --> 19:48.519
And you're sitting here in a hallway...

19:48.687 --> 19:51.898
...with a 28-year-old cheerleader
with a fat lip.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.778
- Hey, you're right.
- Yeah.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.035
Thanks.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.374
What photo album was it?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.920
I don't know. It was you
and a bunch of albino kids.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.759
Oh, my God. Those weren't albino kids.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.011
That was computer camp. Rach.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.767
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.437
- You're a pathetic loser, right?
- Oh, yeah.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.814
Sit.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.197
Hi.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.824
Oh, my God. Joshua.

20:44.451 --> 20:45.701
Look.

20:46.161 --> 20:49.288
All those things I said
about not being ready...

20:49.623 --> 20:52.041
- They're not true?
- No, they're all true.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.501
Oh.

20:54.836 --> 20:55.878
But...

20:56.046 --> 20:57.338
Oh.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.758
Oh, I love that "but."

21:11.311 --> 21:13.646
Um, do you want to go inside
and get some coffee?

21:13.814 --> 21:15.856
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.032
Every time.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.707
- Ooh, what do you got there?
- Pastrami.

21:33.333 --> 21:34.667
Yeah.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.838
- Hey, you know what goes good with that?
- Mm-hm. Corned beef.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.718
Ooh, I was going to say bologna.
But that's better.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.388
- How about a little of that smoked turkey?
- Okay.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.225
Oh, Mama.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.021
- When is the baby due?
- Six months.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.774
Hey, now, if a cow should die
of natural causes...

21:58.942 --> 22:01.027
...I could have one of those, right?

22:01.194 --> 22:03.279
Not if I get there first.
