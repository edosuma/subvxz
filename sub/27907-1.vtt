00:30.361 --> 00:31.795
- Hey, wait.
- Huh?

00:31.797 --> 00:33.564
Hold on. It was right here.

00:33.566 --> 00:35.699
- What are you looking for?
- It was right...

00:35.701 --> 00:37.400
- Is it something private?
- No.

00:37.402 --> 00:39.769
Do you have, like, a sex toy
you haven't told me about?

00:39.771 --> 00:41.805
No. Okay, I got it.

00:41.807 --> 00:43.841
Hold on.
I just wanna play something.

00:46.277 --> 00:47.847
I'm a little nervous, but...

00:48.814 --> 00:50.316
Sorry, I'm sweating.

00:51.116 --> 00:52.716
Okay.

00:56.554 --> 00:57.790
Malory...

01:02.594 --> 01:03.793
Will you marry me?

01:03.795 --> 01:05.265
Oh, my God.

01:06.831 --> 01:08.801
Yeah. Okay.

01:09.701 --> 01:10.804
Sure, I'll marry you.

01:11.236 --> 01:12.304
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:14.173 --> 01:18.142
Oh. No, we've been engaged
for four years.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.877
It's not...
It's not a big deal.

01:19.879 --> 01:21.246
- Thank you.
- Cool.

01:22.180 --> 01:23.814
- What are you doing?
- I'm re-proposing.

01:23.816 --> 01:25.749
Re-proposing is not a thing.

01:25.751 --> 01:27.951
If it was, they wouldn't do it
with a fucking tooth.

01:27.953 --> 01:29.619
This is my actual tooth.

01:29.621 --> 01:31.320
This is my wisdom tooth.

01:31.322 --> 01:34.957
Oh, is that because marrying me would
be the wisest thing you ever did?

01:34.959 --> 01:36.859
I was literally
gonna say that exactly.

01:36.861 --> 01:39.195
I kinda read your mind.

01:39.197 --> 01:42.231
Just thought, like, we should
get a fresh start, you know?

01:42.233 --> 01:44.868
Now instead of saying we've
been engaged for four years,

01:44.870 --> 01:46.904
we can say that
we just got engaged,

01:46.906 --> 01:48.805
and people will buy us drinks.

01:48.807 --> 01:50.407
You know what?
Keep it in the car.

01:50.409 --> 01:51.711
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:54.245 --> 01:55.412
All right. Let's do this.

01:55.414 --> 01:56.213
This is gonna be rough.

01:56.215 --> 01:57.613
It's gonna be like
pulling teeth.

01:57.615 --> 01:59.115
Okay. I see what you did.

01:59.117 --> 02:00.116
You're an expert.

02:00.118 --> 02:01.684
- I know. Thank you.
- It was a joke for you.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.954
- I just don't think you should mock me about it.
- It was for you.

03:52.830 --> 03:55.234
- Okay. It's party time.
- Yeah.

03:56.034 --> 03:57.834
Hello, hello.

03:57.836 --> 03:59.769
- Oh, hey, Mom.
- Hi, Edie.

03:59.771 --> 04:02.204
What took you so long?
Was the traffic bad?

04:02.206 --> 04:03.273
No, not too bad.

04:03.275 --> 04:04.674
- Cal.
- Hi.

04:04.676 --> 04:06.677
- <i>Aloha.</i>
- Mom, this place is nuts.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.078
- Oh.
- Yeah, this place is great.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.745
I've got you all set up
in the back bedroom.

04:09.747 --> 04:11.114
It's westerly facing.

04:11.116 --> 04:12.919
Oh, actually, Mom, uh,
we got a hotel room.

04:13.686 --> 04:14.650
What?

04:14.652 --> 04:16.420
Well, Mom, this is good for you

04:16.422 --> 04:19.091
'cause you and Dad can walk around
naked and be gross like you are at home.

04:21.826 --> 04:22.961
You're such a prude.

04:23.495 --> 04:25.027
Party time!

04:25.029 --> 04:27.000
Everybody's asking for you.

04:30.702 --> 04:32.502
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:32.504 --> 04:34.837
I give you Mr. and Mrs., uh...

04:34.839 --> 04:36.406
Cal and Mal.

04:39.978 --> 04:41.043
Malor!

04:41.045 --> 04:42.314
- Hey.
- Hey!

04:43.615 --> 04:44.981
- Ah, Cal.
- Hi.

04:44.983 --> 04:46.550
- Big C.
- Yeah.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.218
Big C and Malory Key.

04:48.220 --> 04:49.355
Oh, yeah.

04:50.088 --> 04:51.053
Taking good care of her?

04:51.055 --> 04:52.589
- Of course.
- Mm-hmm.

04:52.591 --> 04:53.723
Mm-hmm.

04:53.725 --> 04:54.925
Oh, Lou!

04:54.927 --> 04:56.926
Yeah.

04:56.928 --> 04:58.295
Look at us.

04:58.297 --> 05:01.067
Weddings are fun.
You should try one sometime.

05:02.834 --> 05:05.368
You wanna just go get us
some champagne?

05:05.370 --> 05:06.803
Yeah.

05:06.805 --> 05:08.040
- Okay.
- Yeah.

05:09.975 --> 05:11.007
- What?
- What?

05:11.009 --> 05:12.209
- Come on.
- What?

05:12.211 --> 05:13.543
- Oh, come on.
- What, what?

05:13.545 --> 05:15.745
I mean, we're gonna set a date.
Stop nagging me.

05:15.747 --> 05:17.581
This is not the time... Hey,
Jeff, how are you? Good to see ya.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.983
You know why we couldn't have any
pets when you were really young?

05:19.985 --> 05:22.185
- No, no. Edie, please.
- Because you couldn't commit.

05:22.187 --> 05:24.019
- First you wanted a hermit crab.
- Edie, this is not...

05:24.021 --> 05:25.788
But that was gross,
and then you wanted a turtle,

05:25.790 --> 05:26.957
- then you wanted a gofer.
- This is...

05:26.959 --> 05:28.591
I was being practical.

05:28.593 --> 05:30.060
- It...
- And you were. You were.

05:30.062 --> 05:31.327
I thought you had Asperger's.

05:31.329 --> 05:33.230
And maybe she did.
We don't know...

05:33.232 --> 05:34.865
- Katie! Katie!
- Oh, Katie.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.332
Hey, Katie!

05:36.334 --> 05:37.433
Wow!

05:37.435 --> 05:38.935
Yeah!

05:38.937 --> 05:40.202
Do you wanna tell them?

05:40.204 --> 05:41.303
You wanna tell them now?

05:41.305 --> 05:42.505
You know you wanna tell them.

05:42.507 --> 05:44.440
Well, we talked about
not making it our day.

05:44.442 --> 05:46.075
- No, you've been talking about it, all right?
- What you talking about?

05:46.077 --> 05:47.209
- Come on.
- I know, I'm sorry.

05:47.211 --> 05:48.344
- What?
- It is the right time.

05:48.346 --> 05:50.615
- Well, we found out...
- What?

05:51.315 --> 05:52.214
It's a boy.

05:52.216 --> 05:54.418
And... And...

05:54.420 --> 05:55.618
Drum roll, please.

05:57.855 --> 05:58.921
A girl.

05:58.923 --> 06:00.190
Twins.

06:00.192 --> 06:01.724
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

06:01.726 --> 06:04.026
This is fantastic! Fantastic!

06:04.028 --> 06:05.928
The perfect family.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.332
Nothing could be better.

06:09.334 --> 06:11.368
- Nothing could be better.
- We're so excited. So excited.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.536
Okay, uh,
while we're celebrating,

06:13.538 --> 06:16.074
um, Mal and I
have a little surprise too.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.377
What?

06:17.742 --> 06:18.745
Uh...

06:19.610 --> 06:22.180
We just got engaged.

06:24.415 --> 06:25.582
Oh.

06:25.584 --> 06:26.519
To be married.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.055
So...

06:32.690 --> 06:33.789
Aah!

06:33.791 --> 06:35.291
Like, didn't we know
that already?

06:35.293 --> 06:37.961
Yes, but we recently
got re-engaged.

06:37.963 --> 06:39.995
Re-engaged?
What the fuck is that?

06:39.997 --> 06:41.231
Yeah, re-engaged.
We did it today.

06:41.233 --> 06:42.365
We re-prop... I re-proposed.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.067
What, sort of like
a millennial thing?

06:44.069 --> 06:45.935
It's actually...
Actually, it's really...

06:45.937 --> 06:47.170
It's really popular right now.

06:47.172 --> 06:49.606
- It is?
- Um, so many viral videos.

06:49.608 --> 06:51.274
Like, shocked.

06:51.276 --> 06:53.009
Engaged women who're like,
"I'm engaged again." So...

06:53.011 --> 06:56.079
I gave her... I gave her actually
a ring with my tooth in it.

06:56.081 --> 06:57.647
Well, don't tell them
everything.

06:57.649 --> 06:59.315
- But, um, yeah...
- That's kind of cheap, isn't it?

06:59.317 --> 07:02.351
It's actually... We just were...
We were inspired by you guys.

07:02.353 --> 07:04.253
- That's right. That's right.
- And what you do every year, so...

07:04.255 --> 07:05.390
Isn't that great news?

07:09.026 --> 07:10.392
Great news

07:10.394 --> 07:12.330
would be a wedding invitation.

07:13.831 --> 07:15.534
Engraved on stationery

07:16.567 --> 07:17.637
with a date

07:18.470 --> 07:20.306
that we stick to.

07:23.875 --> 07:25.909
Yeah, we don't want people to
think we're rushing into anything.

07:25.911 --> 07:27.510
Yeah. Right.

07:27.512 --> 07:31.081
We should have just, uh... a
standard engagement period this time?

07:31.083 --> 07:33.916
- Probably, what?
- It's 14 and a half months. I looked it up.

07:33.918 --> 07:34.885
- Oh.
- Yeah.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.219
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

07:36.221 --> 07:41.091
Okay, 14 and a half months
from today, wedding day.

07:41.093 --> 07:44.461
Actually, that's mid-March, which
puts us at St. Patrick's Day,

07:44.463 --> 07:46.062
and our friends would hate us.

07:46.064 --> 07:49.365
- Mm.
- Remember when Peter and Elle got married on New Year's Eve?

07:49.367 --> 07:51.567
Yeah, well, I don't know
what the fuck that was.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.402
- They were in love.
- It was evil.

07:53.404 --> 07:54.771
Yeah.

07:54.773 --> 07:56.373
What about a fall wedding?

07:56.375 --> 07:58.511
We could do that.
Like, October?

07:59.310 --> 08:00.877
What will the theme be?
Skeletons?

08:00.879 --> 08:04.014
It could be cool. We can have,
like, a spooky wedding.

08:04.016 --> 08:05.281
We don't have to
worry about it now, okay?

08:05.283 --> 08:06.382
Tonight we celebrate.

08:06.384 --> 08:07.819
Yes. Tonight we celebrate.

08:14.692 --> 08:16.125
Hello, everyone.

08:16.127 --> 08:20.363
I would like to make a special
announcement with my better half here.

08:20.365 --> 08:23.433
I wanna say,
from the bottom of my hard-on...

08:25.771 --> 08:27.170
Uh, just joking.

08:27.172 --> 08:29.204
From the bottom of my heart,

08:29.206 --> 08:30.574
- I wanna thank you all...
- What time is it?

08:30.576 --> 08:32.474
...very, very much
for being here at this time.

08:32.476 --> 08:33.943
- 9:00.
- You know, I couldn't have gone through

08:33.946 --> 08:36.979
this whole 25 years without
my beloved Edie right here.

08:36.981 --> 08:39.049
And... and without her
being so patient.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.616
Because I am not perfect.

08:40.619 --> 08:43.121
And I got news for you all.
She's not perfect, either.

08:43.956 --> 08:45.888
But together, we are perfection.

08:45.890 --> 08:47.556
- Yes.
- Yeah, we are.

08:47.558 --> 08:49.261
- I love you, honey.
- I love you.

08:50.095 --> 08:51.330
I love you tons.

08:51.996 --> 08:53.964
And, um...

08:53.966 --> 08:56.266
I just wanna thank all our
dear friends for being here.

08:56.268 --> 08:57.633
- Yes, thank you for being here.
- Thank you.

08:57.635 --> 08:58.868
Let's celebrate.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.170
And you gotta be here tomorrow
for the wedding, all right?

09:00.172 --> 09:01.673
So just don't drink too much.

09:02.139 --> 09:04.773
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

09:04.775 --> 09:06.108
- I love you.
- I love you.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.111
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

09:16.922 --> 09:18.224
I think we're gonna get a room.

09:30.235 --> 09:32.469
Let me tell you,

09:32.471 --> 09:35.307
your parents
have got it figured out.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.209
- Yeah, they're really in love.
- No.

09:39.778 --> 09:41.547
- Passion.
- Okay.

09:42.114 --> 09:43.382
You know it.

09:43.649 --> 09:44.914
Yeah.

09:44.916 --> 09:45.818
Write that down.

09:48.754 --> 09:49.822
I know their secret.

09:50.621 --> 09:52.421
Edie and Lou.

09:52.423 --> 09:56.562
They party so, so hard.

09:57.095 --> 10:00.333
I mean, party party.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.668
You know? As in...

10:04.068 --> 10:04.971
Third party.

10:06.538 --> 10:07.472
You know?

10:08.005 --> 10:09.571
Threesomes.

10:09.573 --> 10:11.775
- What the fuck?
- Three... Three ways.

10:11.777 --> 10:13.843
Three... Menage a trois.

10:13.845 --> 10:15.310
Your parents have threesomes?

10:15.312 --> 10:17.513
No, no, no. She's just drunk.

10:17.515 --> 10:19.451
I don't know.

10:20.217 --> 10:21.651
Drunk is truth.

10:28.025 --> 10:29.394
Who the hell is that woman?

10:32.998 --> 10:35.334
Oh, my God.

10:40.772 --> 10:41.641
Huh.

10:51.649 --> 10:53.318
- Just go.
- Yeah.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.417
Malory?

10:55.419 --> 10:57.522
Where you guys going?
Are you leaving?

10:58.123 --> 10:59.855
- Yeah.
- No.

10:59.857 --> 11:01.590
- So lame.
- Who's lame?

11:01.592 --> 11:02.758
It's not lame. It's just...

11:02.760 --> 11:04.194
We're tired.
We had a long drive.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.994
Come on.
The night is still young.

11:05.996 --> 11:07.564
We're still boogieing out there.

11:09.668 --> 11:13.936
Yeah. I mean, we're gonna have so much fun
tomorrow if we get, like, good sleep tonight.

11:13.938 --> 11:16.506
Yeah, we just wanna be fresh
for tomorrow.

11:16.508 --> 11:20.109
If you guys can't hang, you might as well
drive Henry back to the retirement home.

11:20.111 --> 11:21.143
- Yeah.
- Who's Henry?

11:21.145 --> 11:22.778
Henry? He's a good-luck charm.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.214
The guy who marries us
every year.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.485
I think he's out over there
by the pool. I'll go get him.

11:27.885 --> 11:28.754
Love you.

11:29.955 --> 11:30.990
Bye, Lou.

11:33.457 --> 11:35.626
You know, you guys
used to be really fun.

11:42.234 --> 11:46.069
Hey! Oh, Bob's got the bar open.
Can I buy you guys a drink?

11:46.071 --> 11:48.671
- Oh, no. You know, we gotta...
- One... One drink. Come on.

11:48.673 --> 11:50.507
- No.
- We're... We gotta go back to the hotel,

11:50.509 --> 11:52.441
- and get some sleep.
- Yeah.

11:52.443 --> 11:55.978
You know the old saying, "Youth is wasted
on the young"? Did you ever hear that one?

11:55.980 --> 11:57.013
Yeah.

11:57.015 --> 11:58.983
Yeah, well, let me tell you,
you're wasting it.

12:00.051 --> 12:01.217
Get out and dance.

12:01.219 --> 12:03.820
Dance, dance, dance, dance.

12:03.822 --> 12:05.054
Dance the night away.

12:05.056 --> 12:07.924
Oh, hey, by the way, can you
guys pick me up tomorrow?

12:07.926 --> 12:11.261
For the wedding. That would be
so nice if you could do that.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.465
Yeah...

12:13.164 --> 12:15.064
Yeah, I don't...

12:15.066 --> 12:18.368
- No... No...
- You'd think for the money they'd have a van

12:18.370 --> 12:19.835
- to take you someplace.
- Totally.

12:19.837 --> 12:22.070
Henry, we'll pick you up.
It's cool.

12:22.072 --> 12:23.473
Yeah.

12:23.475 --> 12:24.674
- Of course.
- Are you sure?

12:24.676 --> 12:26.946
- Yeah.
- Thank you. That was so nice.

12:27.711 --> 12:29.278
I think we're getting close.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.883
You see the sign
"Sunset Springs"?

12:32.918 --> 12:34.552
I'd like to get sprung,

12:35.220 --> 12:37.219
to tell you the truth.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.151
My parents are so weird.

13:06.317 --> 13:07.584
I like your parents.

13:07.586 --> 13:09.518
- They have fun.
- Yeah.

13:09.520 --> 13:11.286
They're really fun.

13:11.288 --> 13:12.957
Apparently more fun
than I ever knew.

13:13.658 --> 13:15.561
- Yeah, that was weird.
- Mm.

13:17.328 --> 13:18.795
- Is that mine?
- Oh.

13:18.797 --> 13:22.031
Yeah. I didn't bring pajamas,
but I found this in your bag.

13:22.033 --> 13:23.435
No, the toothbrush.

13:25.403 --> 13:27.270
Yeah. Mine was dead.

13:27.272 --> 13:28.872
- Mm.
- Sorry.

13:28.874 --> 13:31.677
Just, like,
rinse it out really well, okay?

13:32.844 --> 13:33.879
Ew!

13:35.113 --> 13:36.713
I gotta do my butt next, though.

13:37.816 --> 13:38.850
Baby got plaque.

13:39.384 --> 13:40.916
Mm.

13:40.918 --> 13:42.420
My God.

13:44.355 --> 13:46.421
Can you move that food
out of here?

13:46.423 --> 13:49.592
The smell of those fries combined with
the thought of my parents having an orgy

13:49.594 --> 13:50.863
makes me wanna barf.

13:51.863 --> 13:53.363
Ugh!

13:53.365 --> 13:55.931
You know, the smell of that food
makes me kind of wanna fuck a little.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.200
- No.
- I smell like your teeth now.

14:26.498 --> 14:27.900
We're, like,
a fun couple, right?

14:28.667 --> 14:30.702
- Yeah.
- We have fun.

14:32.003 --> 14:34.203
Yeah, we're fun.
I mean, we're like...

14:34.205 --> 14:38.174
Maybe not as fun as all those old
people who are still partying right now

14:38.176 --> 14:39.842
and doing coke, probably, but...

14:39.844 --> 14:41.180
we have our own brand of fun.

14:42.080 --> 14:43.912
Yeah, we don't need a party.

14:43.914 --> 14:46.648
Because the only reason to party is to go out and
meet somebody who's awesome and your soulmate,

14:46.650 --> 14:48.887
and you already got that.

14:49.888 --> 14:51.621
Just me?

14:51.623 --> 14:53.055
- I have it?
- And I'm still looking.

14:53.057 --> 14:55.791
But I get closer
and closer every day.

14:55.793 --> 14:57.528
Cool. I'll try to change.

15:00.164 --> 15:01.866
Whatever. We're fine, right?

15:03.999 --> 15:03.968
Yeah, we're fine.

15:05.703 --> 15:07.171
- All right.
- I'm not worried.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.604
I love you.

15:09.606 --> 15:10.708
I love you too.

15:12.844 --> 15:14.243
Good night. Huh?

15:14.245 --> 15:15.545
I was gonna say good night too.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.446
Oh. Yeah. Jinx.

15:17.448 --> 15:18.716
- Good night.
- Good night.

15:19.049 --> 15:19.984
Okay.

15:33.163 --> 15:34.464
Sorry.

15:34.466 --> 15:35.732
Did you set an alarm?

15:35.734 --> 15:37.666
No, it's my sleep tracker.

15:37.668 --> 15:40.469
It tells me when to turn in
so I can get nine hours.

15:40.471 --> 15:42.405
And we were asleep
before it went off.

15:42.407 --> 15:43.642
Yeah, then we win.

15:44.642 --> 15:46.912
- Sorry. Good night for real.
- Good night.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.199
- We should go out.
- I was just thinking that.

16:11.201 --> 16:12.935
Like, we're on vacation.
We need to "vacate."

16:12.937 --> 16:14.903
Exactly. We shouldn't
be in here all night.

16:14.905 --> 16:17.205
There's a whole city
of palms to see.

16:17.207 --> 16:19.108
I mean, who needs
nine hours of sleep, anyway?

16:19.110 --> 16:20.843
- It's Friday night, like...
- I don't need that.

16:20.845 --> 16:22.712
- No.
- That's too much sleep, actually.

16:22.714 --> 16:24.914
Plus, we have, uh,
an engagement to celebrate.

16:24.916 --> 16:26.516
Yeah. There's a bar
across the street.

16:26.518 --> 16:28.017
We could go there,
and like, be other people.

16:28.019 --> 16:29.584
We could just pretend
we're Canadian.

16:29.586 --> 16:32.354
Just, like, do the Canadian
accent 'cause it's super easy.

16:32.356 --> 16:33.922
- Uh-huh.
- And it'll just, like, be really nice.

16:33.924 --> 16:36.025
Everyone will think we're Canadian.
It'll be fun.

16:36.027 --> 16:38.728
That's perfect. I know exactly
what you're talking "aboot."

16:38.730 --> 16:39.829
- How about this, though?
- Perfect.

16:39.831 --> 16:41.196
You go there first,

16:41.198 --> 16:43.598
then I show up a little bit
later and I pick you up?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.001
That's great.
We're both Canadians.

16:45.003 --> 16:47.103
- Yeah, we're two strange Canadians...
- Okay.

16:47.105 --> 16:50.006
...meeting in the desert.
We have an instant connection.

16:50.008 --> 16:52.041
- We're both from the same place.
- Yeah.

16:52.043 --> 16:53.876
Yeah, and no one else
understands it.

16:53.878 --> 16:55.344
- Right.
- Yeah, it's great.

16:55.346 --> 16:56.248
What are you gonna wear?

16:57.115 --> 16:58.281
I'll surprise you.

16:58.283 --> 17:01.184
Well, I'm gonna be
hitting on you pretty hard,

17:01.186 --> 17:02.951
and, uh, I don't think...

17:02.953 --> 17:04.821
you are gonna be able
to resist my charms.

17:05.856 --> 17:06.857
Mm.

17:08.192 --> 17:10.492
Oh, my God. Can you, like,
do that in the bathroom?

17:10.493 --> 17:12.494
- I'm sorry...
- You just looked me directly in the eye.

17:12.497 --> 17:14.497
All right, I'm sorry.

17:14.499 --> 17:17.365
No, but for reals, I'm gonna
hit on you so fucking hard.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.255
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

17:40.057 --> 17:41.093
Mm.

17:42.192 --> 17:43.394
Ugh! God.

17:44.362 --> 17:46.629
Not what you were expecting?

17:46.631 --> 17:50.533
Oh, yeah. No, these spicy
cocktail things are too much.

17:50.535 --> 17:52.004
Can't have diarrhea
in this dress.

17:52.436 --> 17:53.702
Well...

17:53.704 --> 17:57.175
it's a good thing
you're only out...

17:57.842 --> 17:59.709
$18? Are you serious?

17:59.711 --> 18:01.246
This place is such a rip-off.

18:02.113 --> 18:03.578
Desert pricing.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.046
Oh, let's do shots.

18:05.048 --> 18:06.782
- Oh, no, that's okay. Someone's coming...
- Yo!

18:06.784 --> 18:07.883
Hey, blondie.

18:07.885 --> 18:09.285
Another Sriracharita?

18:09.287 --> 18:10.152
Ew, no.

18:10.154 --> 18:11.786
Actually, I was just
in the restroom,

18:11.788 --> 18:13.823
and someone did a real
paint job in there.

18:13.825 --> 18:15.423
It... It's sick.

18:15.425 --> 18:16.828
Shit. Animals.

18:18.695 --> 18:20.062
Go for the bourbon.

18:20.064 --> 18:20.966
What? No.

18:21.332 --> 18:22.234
Fine.

18:32.309 --> 18:33.709
Fill 'em up. Fill 'em up.
Don't stop.

18:33.711 --> 18:35.577
Okay.

18:35.579 --> 18:36.914
Hurry.
Quick, quick, quick!

18:37.481 --> 18:38.416
Oh, shit.

18:39.651 --> 18:40.850
Mm.

18:40.852 --> 18:42.354
Maintenance is on it. Sorry.

18:42.819 --> 18:44.021
Yeah. Thank you.

18:45.623 --> 18:47.722
- That was insane.
- I know.

18:47.724 --> 18:49.424
Do criminals feel this
amazing all the time?

18:49.426 --> 18:51.863
- Only until they get caught.
- Wow!

18:52.297 --> 18:53.528
He had no idea.

18:53.530 --> 18:55.299
He's such an idiot.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.100
- That was fun.
- Mm.

18:58.102 --> 18:59.037
You're fun.

19:03.141 --> 19:05.410
- Yes.
- I mean, it is real crazy.

19:06.611 --> 19:07.943
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:07.945 --> 19:10.680
- What year was it?
- It was, like, in 1995.

19:10.682 --> 19:11.980
Whoa, hey.

19:11.982 --> 19:14.382
Forgive me for nosing in there.

19:14.384 --> 19:15.617
Name's Ryerson.

19:15.619 --> 19:17.152
Can I get you
a Labatt Blue or two?

19:17.154 --> 19:18.955
You don't have to do the
Canadian thing, it's okay.

19:18.957 --> 19:20.826
- We're not doing the Canadian thing?
- Just drop it.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.159
Okay.

19:23.161 --> 19:25.594
- Uh, you look very beautiful.
- Thank you.

19:25.596 --> 19:26.929
- Yeah.
- Cool.

19:26.931 --> 19:29.532
Um, you have to meet Jesse.
This is my fiance, Cal.

19:29.534 --> 19:31.534
- Oh, hi.
- Fiance?

19:31.536 --> 19:33.102
What about you and me?

19:33.104 --> 19:34.536
Okay. We have to
get you caught up.

19:34.538 --> 19:36.107
Sit, sit, sit.

19:38.375 --> 19:39.443
Okay.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.378
So, what were you saying?

19:41.380 --> 19:43.011
- Oh, I just... The car was so old...
- Yeah.

19:43.013 --> 19:45.046
- ...like, you just couldn't.
- So many memories like that.

19:45.048 --> 19:47.115
I know. Oh, totally.
I would drive everyone around.

19:47.117 --> 19:48.450
Do you guys want
any beers or something?

19:48.452 --> 19:49.986
- Let's do it. Are you ready?
- Okay. Oh, yeah.

19:49.988 --> 19:50.920
- Okay, you know the drill.
- Yes.

19:50.922 --> 19:52.054
Watch this, Cal.

19:52.056 --> 19:53.154
Ew! What?

19:53.156 --> 19:55.024
- Here? That...
- Oh, my God.

19:55.026 --> 19:56.726
The guys' too?
That is disgusting.

19:56.728 --> 20:00.962
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah. My friend right here was just in the men's,

20:00.964 --> 20:02.465
and he said that
there's like a...

20:02.467 --> 20:05.000
a FEMA-level disaster in there.
Right? Tell him what you saw.

20:05.002 --> 20:08.671
You just said there was, like, shit all
over the floor and the walls and stuff.

20:08.673 --> 20:09.840
Like, in the sink.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.475
Uh, yeah.

20:12.477 --> 20:15.478
I thought it was, at first, a design
thing, like, part of the tiles, but...

20:15.480 --> 20:17.580
- There's shit... everywhere.
- Yeah, you know what?

20:17.582 --> 20:19.015
I'm giving you one star on Yelp.

20:19.017 --> 20:22.418
It's the cocaine. It turns
people into confetti cannons.

20:22.420 --> 20:23.486
I'll get it cleaned up.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.855
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

20:25.856 --> 20:27.459
- Okay, hurry.
- Watch this.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.726
Malory, I think...

20:30.728 --> 20:31.893
Oh, shit.

20:31.895 --> 20:33.461
Okay. Get out.

20:33.463 --> 20:35.230
- I'm so sorry.
- All three of you. Get out.

20:35.232 --> 20:36.731
- She was getting a napkin.
- You know what?

20:36.733 --> 20:38.534
- Move it along. Thank you so much.
- No, fuck this place.

20:38.536 --> 20:40.568
Your drinks suck. Let's go to my place.
I have booze.

20:40.570 --> 20:42.004
- I'll get us a car.
- Bring the party elsewhere.

20:42.006 --> 20:44.073
- I... I'm so sorry.
- Sir, I will pay for that.

20:44.075 --> 20:46.074
- I will call the cops.
- Guys, come on. Come on.

20:46.076 --> 20:47.476
- Are we going? Who is she?
- She's fun.

20:47.478 --> 20:49.077
- Come on.
- We'll see. We'll see what happens.

20:49.079 --> 20:50.915
- I don't...
- No, no. I'm keeping this.

20:51.816 --> 20:53.949
- Hey, come on.
- I just bought that.

20:53.951 --> 20:55.319
Wait, wait, wait.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.042
Okay.

21:18.942 --> 21:21.710
- Look at all this shit.
- I know.

21:21.712 --> 21:24.516
There's gotta be, like,
a henna tattoo kit somewhere.

21:25.249 --> 21:28.084
It's like Gandhi's dorm room.

21:28.086 --> 21:29.552
How old do you think she is?

21:29.554 --> 21:32.455
Looking at her place, she
could be a thousand years old.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.123
Uh, we... We should leave.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.294
Let's leave.

21:37.127 --> 21:42.131
So, I didn't really have a
chance to hide all my secrets.

21:42.133 --> 21:44.767
But, please, don't let that
stop you from snooping.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.635
Also, I'm breaking out
the good stuff.

21:47.637 --> 21:50.305
- Oh.
- In for a treat.

21:50.307 --> 21:51.707
Thank you.

21:51.709 --> 21:52.807
Thank you.

21:52.809 --> 21:54.178
No. Thank you.

21:54.778 --> 21:56.746
Both of you. It is...

21:56.748 --> 22:01.950
It's so refreshing to meet
kindred spirits and live... strangely.

22:01.952 --> 22:03.187
It totally is.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.988
- Cheers.
- Yeah. Cheers.

22:05.990 --> 22:07.259
To living strangely.

22:07.724 --> 22:08.659
Okay.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.068
Mm.

22:25.276 --> 22:27.276
Oh. Let me put
something else on.

22:27.278 --> 22:28.477
Mm-hmm.

22:33.817 --> 22:35.651
Mm, it's got, um...

22:35.653 --> 22:37.353
a balsamic tinge to it.

22:37.355 --> 22:38.687
It's my favorite.

22:38.689 --> 22:39.921
It's great. Thank you.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.657
It'd be really good on a salad.
With a salad.

22:41.659 --> 22:44.396
- With a salad, it would be good. Nice.
- Just paired. Yum-yum.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.102
Is this a, um...

22:51.769 --> 22:53.035
Is this a geode?

22:53.037 --> 22:55.004
No, amethyst point.

22:55.006 --> 22:57.840
It's actually one of my tools.

22:57.842 --> 23:00.342
- For what?
- Ever since I was a little girl,

23:00.344 --> 23:03.112
I've just had this thing.
I know how to mix energies.

23:03.114 --> 23:05.247
And I can sense
matching vibrations.

23:05.249 --> 23:06.748
- Oh!
- I'm an energy alchemist.

23:06.750 --> 23:07.816
- Right.
- Oh.

23:07.818 --> 23:11.019
Now, I could tell
instantly with you.

23:11.021 --> 23:14.489
We are vibrating
at the exact same frequency.

23:14.491 --> 23:15.790
Can you feel that?

23:15.792 --> 23:17.860
I can. Yeah, it's crazy.

23:17.862 --> 23:19.694
I mean, I wouldn't have, like,

23:19.696 --> 23:20.962
put it in those words, you know.

23:20.964 --> 23:22.597
I don't really even know
what they mean.

23:22.599 --> 23:27.105
Yeah. No. For sure, it
feels like I've known you for so...

23:27.605 --> 23:28.640
Totally.

23:29.773 --> 23:32.807
But you need balance, right?

23:32.809 --> 23:34.211
I mean, too much of one type,

23:34.846 --> 23:36.578
the scale tips.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.149
- Right.
- Cal.

23:39.851 --> 23:42.351
You are bringing this...

23:42.353 --> 23:46.490
massively strong masculine
current into this space.

23:47.023 --> 23:48.459
It is working for me.

23:49.359 --> 23:51.762
Uh, I'm glad
you picked up on that.

23:53.163 --> 23:56.364
And I didn't want it to be
overpowering necessarily,

23:56.366 --> 23:59.934
but I wanted it to vibrate.

23:59.936 --> 24:04.273
You know, to be honest, I kind of
thought I was gonna be a third wheel.

24:04.275 --> 24:06.511
I mean,
with all your...

24:07.178 --> 24:08.547
sensual energy.

24:09.946 --> 24:11.580
Oh, ours?

24:11.582 --> 24:15.620
Oh, come on. It is practically oozing
out of the two of you. It is...

24:17.121 --> 24:18.190
It's intoxicating.

24:19.624 --> 24:20.592
People have said.

24:21.526 --> 24:22.690
You know, we ooze.

24:22.692 --> 24:24.429
We always say
we're cruisin' for an oozin'.

24:25.096 --> 24:26.295
Are you serious?

24:26.297 --> 24:29.064
Yes, it is like, bam!
It's, like, exploding.

24:32.737 --> 24:33.605
Okay.

24:43.780 --> 24:44.715
Okay.

24:46.017 --> 24:47.352
This is great.

24:48.219 --> 24:49.688
Okay, close your eyes.

24:52.323 --> 24:53.391
Breathe.

24:55.358 --> 24:57.959
Okay. Visualize the energy.

24:57.961 --> 25:00.397
What color do you see?

25:01.699 --> 25:02.601
Amber.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.365
That's great.

25:04.367 --> 25:08.003
- Mm.
- Yeah. Amber is the color of your energy.

25:12.343 --> 25:14.410
Whoa.

25:14.412 --> 25:18.216
And feel as the energy radiates
through your whole body.

25:19.115 --> 25:20.684
Through every hair.

25:21.885 --> 25:23.221
Every toe.

25:24.855 --> 25:26.921
And every cell.

25:29.393 --> 25:33.765
Our blood is now pumping
in a perfect circle.

25:34.765 --> 25:36.599
- Triangle.
- Okay. Shh!

25:36.601 --> 25:37.769
- Sorry.
- Shut up.

25:38.970 --> 25:43.505
Beats out of my heart,
into Mal's arm.

25:43.507 --> 25:47.610
Beats down through her chest.

25:47.612 --> 25:50.548
Around into her shoulders.

25:51.749 --> 25:56.254
Making its way down
into her delicate fingertips.

25:57.020 --> 26:00.224
And working its way into Cal.

26:00.724 --> 26:02.024
Oh!

26:04.561 --> 26:05.596
There it is.

26:06.896 --> 26:08.198
Wow.

26:11.167 --> 26:14.702
You guys, that was fucking nuts. I...

26:14.704 --> 26:17.672
- I feel so connected to you guys.
- Oh, my God. Me too.

26:17.674 --> 26:19.040
That was good.

26:19.042 --> 26:20.074
- Wow.
- Yeah.

26:20.076 --> 26:21.376
I'm, like, covered in chills.

26:21.378 --> 26:23.344
That was really powerful.

26:23.346 --> 26:24.880
- It was crazy.
- Yeah.

26:24.882 --> 26:27.315
Um, do you mind if I just...

26:27.317 --> 26:28.851
pop out for a second?

26:28.853 --> 26:30.052
- Yeah, down the hall.
- Okay.

26:30.054 --> 26:31.853
I will probably go with her too.

26:31.855 --> 26:32.755
- Okay.
- Yeah.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.590
- Just conserve water, you know.
- Yes.

26:34.592 --> 26:36.595
Aww. I love that.

26:42.298 --> 26:44.199
- What is going on?
- I don't know.

26:44.201 --> 26:46.035
I mean, is she, like, into us?

26:46.037 --> 26:47.469
I think so. Maybe.

26:47.471 --> 26:49.203
- I mean, she's hot, right?
- Yeah, totally.

26:49.205 --> 26:50.905
- I know.
- I mean, you are way hotter.

26:50.907 --> 26:52.507
No, she's hotter. It's fine.

26:52.509 --> 26:54.176
But are we reading it right?

26:54.178 --> 26:55.443
- I mean, are we...
- Are you into her?

26:55.445 --> 26:57.312
I... I think you are into her.

26:57.314 --> 26:58.479
Why... Why are you saying that?

26:58.481 --> 26:59.981
Because you did
the shoulder roll thing.

26:59.983 --> 27:02.017
When she touched your shoulders,
you rolled your shoulders back,

27:02.019 --> 27:03.451
and you basically had an orgasm.

27:03.453 --> 27:05.286
I didn't roll my shoulders back.

27:05.288 --> 27:06.921
I don't do anything
with my shoulders.

27:06.923 --> 27:09.257
You do roll your shoulders back, and
you did it out there on the couch.

27:09.259 --> 27:11.994
Okay. Well, I didn't mean to.
I mean...

27:11.996 --> 27:13.228
She was looking
right at your eyes

27:13.230 --> 27:15.396
when she said
we were intoxicating.

27:15.398 --> 27:17.434
Obviously she's gonna be
into me, Mal.

27:18.169 --> 27:20.169
- Shut up.
- Are we intoxicating?

27:20.171 --> 27:22.004
I mean, I think we might be.

27:22.006 --> 27:23.171
Does she, like, want us?

27:23.173 --> 27:25.407
I think she might want us.

27:25.409 --> 27:27.646
Is everybody having
a threesome except for us?

27:28.612 --> 27:30.515
Okay. We're not doing this.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.413
- No.
- We're not.

27:32.415 --> 27:33.414
We're not doing this.

27:33.416 --> 27:35.217
I don't even...

27:35.219 --> 27:37.385
- I don't even wanna do...
- Me neither.

27:37.387 --> 27:38.687
I don't need to do that.

27:38.689 --> 27:39.988
She's so weird.

27:39.990 --> 27:42.458
- She's so...
- And I don't... I just love you.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.058
- I love you.
- I love you.

27:44.060 --> 27:44.992
- Good.
- We're good.

27:44.994 --> 27:47.028
Okay. We're not gonna do it.

27:47.030 --> 27:48.566
- I know. I know.
- Okay.

27:53.503 --> 27:56.473
But we're not ourselves tonight.

27:57.208 --> 27:58.373
Really?

27:58.375 --> 27:59.708
Are you, really?

27:59.710 --> 28:02.944
I could be cool with this
if you are cool with it.

28:02.946 --> 28:05.146
I... I think I'm cool with it.

28:05.148 --> 28:08.851
I'm totally cool with it, and I will just
be the water boy if that's what it takes.

28:08.853 --> 28:11.219
- What?
- Like, if you guys are having a great time,

28:11.221 --> 28:13.988
I'll just go in the corner, and
I'll drink water, and I'll jerk off,

28:13.990 --> 28:16.959
and I'll change the music,
or whatever. Just, like...

28:16.961 --> 28:18.395
try to include me.

28:18.796 --> 28:19.995
Thanks, Cal.

28:19.997 --> 28:20.895
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:20.897 --> 28:22.663
- Okay.
- Good. 'Cause I wanna have fun.

28:22.665 --> 28:24.432
- You are gonna have a great time.
- I want you to have fun too.

28:24.434 --> 28:25.867
- I will have fun just watching.
- Okay.

28:25.869 --> 28:27.902
- Just watching and cranking it.
- Okay.

28:27.904 --> 28:29.270
- Great. Okay.
- Okay.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.474
- Let's do it.
- Wait, wait.

28:33.144 --> 28:34.913
- What are you doing?
- Just cleaning up.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.246
You're washing your balls?

28:37.248 --> 28:38.549
Yeah. What...

28:39.383 --> 28:41.048
You're washing your balls
in her sink?

28:41.050 --> 28:42.151
I can't do it in her kitchen.

28:42.153 --> 28:43.986
That's where
she brushes her teeth.

28:43.988 --> 28:45.488
Why are you cleaning it at all?

28:45.490 --> 28:47.689
Because it's the desert and we've
been in a car for, like, four hours.

28:47.691 --> 28:50.258
Okay, but you've never
washed your balls for me.

28:50.260 --> 28:52.760
That is, like, the most offensive
thing you've ever said to me,

28:52.762 --> 28:55.029
because I have never
washed my balls more

28:55.031 --> 28:57.668
for anybody else
in my entire life than you.

28:58.134 --> 28:59.703
- Aww.
- Yeah.

29:02.940 --> 29:04.806
Okay. Just hurry up.

29:16.053 --> 29:18.719
Wait, wait. Don't fall
in love with her, okay?

29:18.721 --> 29:20.322
- What?
- She's, like, young and hot.

29:20.324 --> 29:22.591
And she probably has perfect
nipples, and... Just don't.

29:22.593 --> 29:24.325
I don't care about her nipples.

29:24.327 --> 29:25.730
I am not gonna
fall in love with her.

29:26.696 --> 29:28.065
But you...

29:29.333 --> 29:30.599
You can't fall in love
with her either.

29:30.601 --> 29:32.334
What? You still think
I'm secretly gay?

29:32.336 --> 29:33.835
I think everybody's 10% gay,

29:33.837 --> 29:35.336
and you dated a chick
in college.

29:35.338 --> 29:38.207
I went to Oberlin. You're supposed
to date a chick at Oberlin.

29:38.209 --> 29:39.975
It's what it is. Look.

29:39.977 --> 29:41.809
- It's gonna be great. We'll have a good time. Okay?
- Okay.

29:41.811 --> 29:43.812
And if you don't like something,
just say stop.

29:43.814 --> 29:45.650
Or why don't you think
a safe word or something?

29:46.083 --> 29:47.415
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

29:47.417 --> 29:50.518
- Okay.
- If you don't like something, just say, "Wait, my car."

29:50.520 --> 29:52.353
- What... What?
- Like, "Wait, my car.

29:52.355 --> 29:54.355
- "I'm gonna get a ticket like..." Oh, street cleaning.
- Oh, yeah. That's good.

29:54.357 --> 29:56.725
- Say, "Street cleaning."
- Okay, we're gonna have fun. It's gonna be great.

29:56.727 --> 29:58.125
- It's gonna be so fun.
- Okay. Great. I love you.

29:58.127 --> 29:59.327
- I love you too.
- I love you.

29:59.329 --> 30:00.328
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:00.330 --> 30:01.763
Okay.

30:01.765 --> 30:03.498
- Aah!
- Calm down, calm down.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.766
- Okay.
- Be cool.

30:04.768 --> 30:05.670
Okay.

30:09.272 --> 30:10.474
Hello?

30:11.808 --> 30:14.409
Hi. Hey, yeah,
just go sit down,

30:14.411 --> 30:16.510
take your jackets off,
make yourself comfortable.

30:16.512 --> 30:17.546
- Okay.
- I'll be out in a minute.

30:17.548 --> 30:18.750
- Great.
- Okay.

30:44.441 --> 30:45.643
Is she naked?

30:46.809 --> 30:47.642
I think so.

31:01.291 --> 31:02.459
<i>Konnichiwa.</i>

31:03.594 --> 31:05.096
- Hi.
- Hey.

31:07.163 --> 31:09.131
- Wow.
- Where'd your clothes go?

31:09.133 --> 31:14.036
Oh, yeah. Just took them off. Had
to let my skin breathe a little.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.539
- Yeah.
- Badass. Yes.

31:16.906 --> 31:19.373
I'm not making you
uncomfortable, am I?

31:19.375 --> 31:21.075
No.

31:21.077 --> 31:22.110
- No?
- No.

31:22.112 --> 31:24.546
No.

31:24.548 --> 31:25.948
- No.
- Ugh, no.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.083
No.

31:27.085 --> 31:30.184
Oh, God, there's so much
space between us right now.

31:30.186 --> 31:31.622
Get in here.

31:33.356 --> 31:34.858
- That's better.
- Yeah.

31:36.993 --> 31:38.326
What are you two into?

31:38.328 --> 31:42.264
- Um...
- I've been getting into baking my own pretzels recently.

31:42.266 --> 31:43.565
It's super easy.

31:43.567 --> 31:45.400
- Yeah, we made a pizza one.
- Oh, yeah.

31:45.402 --> 31:48.269
Okay. I'm not asking
for a dating profile.

31:48.271 --> 31:50.404
I mean, what is it like
to be a fly on the wall

31:50.406 --> 31:54.977
on a romantic night
between Mal and Cal?

31:54.979 --> 31:57.645
- Uh...
- Oh, my God. Our society is so weird about sex.

31:57.647 --> 31:58.747
We don't even talk about it.

31:58.749 --> 32:00.114
No, we're not weird about it.

32:00.116 --> 32:01.816
- No, we talk about it all the time.
- All the time.

32:01.818 --> 32:03.517
Like, always. We're just
always talking about it.

32:03.519 --> 32:07.021
Yeah, our friends say, "Can you
talk about anything else? Sports?

32:07.023 --> 32:09.324
"Politics? Anything." 'Cause
we just wanna talk about sex.

32:09.326 --> 32:10.359
- We just love it.
- Great.

32:10.361 --> 32:11.996
- Yeah.
- Paint a picture for me.

32:13.063 --> 32:14.132
Okay, um...

32:14.964 --> 32:16.364
Close your eyes.

32:16.366 --> 32:17.734
Fun.

32:19.036 --> 32:20.171
- Hmm.
- Um...

32:20.903 --> 32:22.871
- It's super romantic.
- Yeah?

32:22.873 --> 32:25.007
Intensely romantic.

32:25.009 --> 32:26.408
How so?

32:26.410 --> 32:30.011
I will cook a meal
for my lover.

32:30.013 --> 32:31.278
- Yeah.
- Oh.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.748
Some salted bread.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.017
I can just smell it
in the house.

32:36.019 --> 32:39.121
Like, not just the food.
It's also...

32:39.123 --> 32:40.421
- Sex.
- Sex.

32:40.423 --> 32:42.490
And, um...

32:42.492 --> 32:46.661
- The pheromones, uh, of genetic...
- Mm-hmm.

32:46.663 --> 32:48.066
...DNA and mixing.

32:50.701 --> 32:52.500
And then, we touch.

32:52.502 --> 32:53.634
We touch each other.

32:53.636 --> 32:55.269
There's a lot of touching.

32:55.271 --> 32:57.040
- Rubbing.
- Caressing.

32:58.041 --> 32:59.975
Skin on skin.

32:59.977 --> 33:03.178
And she'll
pet me heavy...

33:03.180 --> 33:04.816
Heavily, and it's heavenly.

33:05.516 --> 33:06.748
I know.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.817
I like to take a candle
and just drip the wax

33:09.819 --> 33:11.519
all over our nipples.

33:11.521 --> 33:14.355
Ooh! Yes, I love that.

33:14.357 --> 33:17.859
- Yeah.
- Oh, perfect, 'cause we do the candle thing almost every...

33:17.861 --> 33:19.494
...night.

33:19.496 --> 33:21.028
Yeah, all the time.

33:21.030 --> 33:23.835
And then we'll, uh,
wipe that off with a...

33:24.867 --> 33:26.367
hot rag.

33:26.369 --> 33:28.636
Or a towelette, moist.

33:28.638 --> 33:29.805
Very moist.

33:29.807 --> 33:30.974
- Yeah.
- Moist.

33:31.775 --> 33:33.475
And we throw that away.

33:33.477 --> 33:35.380
- Oh, we recycle it.
- We are...

33:36.180 --> 33:38.149
- earth-conscious.
- Yeah.

33:39.383 --> 33:41.583
And then...

33:41.585 --> 33:43.517
Then what?
Don't hold back.

33:43.519 --> 33:46.888
Then he takes my...
my bra off...

33:46.890 --> 33:48.659
- That's right.
- ...with his teeth.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.663
That's like me knocking
on the bra's door.

33:53.297 --> 33:54.496
And then...

33:54.498 --> 33:55.767
And then her panties...

33:56.933 --> 33:57.934
Um...

33:58.501 --> 33:59.567
Gone. They're gone.

33:59.569 --> 34:00.669
Bye-bye.

34:00.671 --> 34:02.340
Not gonna need those
where we're going.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.039
He takes those off
with his boner.

34:06.309 --> 34:07.979
Yes. Yes, I do.

34:08.478 --> 34:09.777
Really?

34:09.780 --> 34:11.646
How do you do that?

34:11.648 --> 34:13.648
A dick-gician never tells.

34:13.650 --> 34:15.748
It's very curved
at the end, so...

34:15.751 --> 34:17.119
My little katana.

34:18.621 --> 34:21.422
Made me think of the katana
with your kimono.

34:21.425 --> 34:22.690
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>Konnichiwa.</i>

34:22.693 --> 34:26.293
Yeah, and I get
really turned on.

34:26.295 --> 34:27.628
Yeah, I get really wet.

34:27.630 --> 34:32.069
Yeah, and I'm wet too
because she's...

34:32.702 --> 34:33.869
dripping.

34:33.871 --> 34:36.239
So wet like a Slip'N Slide.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.074
Mm-hmm.
- And...

34:39.076 --> 34:43.181
We look at each other
with really intense eye contact.

34:43.780 --> 34:46.317
And we know it's on.

34:51.188 --> 34:52.753
Oh...

34:52.755 --> 34:54.922
- Okay.
- That's right. It is okay.

34:54.925 --> 34:56.590
Because in that moment,

34:56.592 --> 34:58.693
two have become one.

34:59.730 --> 35:00.965
But also...

35:02.199 --> 35:03.664
three can become one.

35:03.666 --> 35:06.237
That's... sex math.

35:07.336 --> 35:08.371
Oh.

35:08.871 --> 35:10.104
What are you doing?

35:10.106 --> 35:11.873
Oh, do you wanna do me first?

35:11.875 --> 35:12.941
We can just do that.

35:12.943 --> 35:14.575
Yeah, I can just be
the water boy.

35:14.577 --> 35:15.776
- What?
- I'll just stand in the corner.

35:15.778 --> 35:16.744
- He'll just jerk off.
- Yeah.

35:16.746 --> 35:19.282
Uh... Oh, my God.
What the fuck?

35:20.516 --> 35:21.449
What?

35:21.451 --> 35:23.284
Are you two retarded?

35:23.286 --> 35:24.353
What?

35:24.355 --> 35:26.854
- Who says "retarded"?
- Nobody says that anymore.

35:26.856 --> 35:28.889
What did you think
that this was?

35:28.891 --> 35:31.392
- Uh, we thought...
- Oh, my God.

35:31.394 --> 35:33.827
You thought I wanted to have
a threesome with you two?

35:33.829 --> 35:35.796
That's so embarrassing.

35:35.798 --> 35:38.200
Um, yeah, you were
touching us all night long.

35:38.202 --> 35:40.869
- You touched her all over here.
- Yeah, my shoulders.

35:40.871 --> 35:44.972
No, honey, you were just
feeling my energy.

35:44.974 --> 35:46.641
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

35:46.643 --> 35:48.610
You were touching her in a sexual way. You put her...

35:48.612 --> 35:49.878
...mouth around your finger.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.112
- That turned me on.
- See?

35:52.114 --> 35:54.048
We came back from the bathroom
and you were naked.

35:54.050 --> 35:56.483
Yeah, so I could breathe.

35:56.485 --> 35:59.454
- Uh...
- Do you not see how that's just a little misleading?

35:59.456 --> 36:01.755
Oh, what, are you two afraid
of a little nudity? Boo!

36:01.757 --> 36:03.023
Oh.

36:03.025 --> 36:04.959
- God.
- Now you're just flashing us.

36:04.961 --> 36:06.927
We are receiving
the right message.

36:06.929 --> 36:08.429
You don't know
what you're sending out.

36:08.431 --> 36:12.133
- Wow.
- What is it with your generation and nudity? Who cares?

36:12.135 --> 36:14.269
- Our generation? We're like...
- What?

36:14.271 --> 36:16.704
- ...five years older than you.
- If that.

36:16.706 --> 36:18.773
- I get carded all the time.
- All the time.

36:18.775 --> 36:20.374
You know what? I think
that you two should leave.

36:20.376 --> 36:22.443
I can't even stand
being in here right now.

36:22.445 --> 36:23.380
I'm moving. Go.

36:24.681 --> 36:26.380
Okay. Yeah, not a problem.

36:26.382 --> 36:29.251
You know what, because your living
space is giving me an aroma migraine.

36:29.253 --> 36:30.885
- Yeah.
- All this sandalwood in the air.

36:30.887 --> 36:32.686
You need to tone it down, missy.

36:32.688 --> 36:34.088
Yes, and you know,

36:34.090 --> 36:36.657
check out some 311 because
they are chill as fuck.

36:36.659 --> 36:41.429
- And your blood flow is fucked, by the way.
- Okay. Get out, freaks!

36:41.431 --> 36:42.664
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:42.666 --> 36:43.932
- We'll get out. We're the freaks.
- We're the freaks. Okay.

36:43.934 --> 36:44.999
- Here you go.
- Mm-hmm.

36:45.001 --> 36:46.900
Oh, beads.
How fucking surprising!

36:46.902 --> 36:48.603
We're freaks? She's a freak.

36:48.605 --> 36:49.970
Horny little freak.

36:49.972 --> 36:52.173
I will never say this again,
but she was asking for it.

36:52.175 --> 36:54.775
Seriously?
A threesome? You guys?

36:54.777 --> 36:56.110
Is there something
wrong with us?

36:56.112 --> 36:58.445
No, we could totally have
a threesome if we wanted to.

36:58.447 --> 36:59.713
- Totally.
- Totally.

36:59.715 --> 37:01.282
All right.
So what are the rules?

37:01.284 --> 37:03.184
- No jealousy.
- No, I don't have time for that.

37:03.186 --> 37:06.987
And whoever we pick, they're
just there for our own enjoyment.

37:06.989 --> 37:08.123
They're for our pleasure.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.791
They're a fucktoy.
They don't mean anything.

37:09.793 --> 37:11.059
- They don't mean anything.
- No.

37:11.061 --> 37:13.161
- What else?
- Uh, it has to be the right person.

37:13.163 --> 37:14.929
- Of course, we both have to agree.
- Mm-hmm.

37:14.931 --> 37:15.996
- Kissing.
- Mm-hmm.

37:15.998 --> 37:17.132
- Touching.
- Yeah.

37:17.134 --> 37:18.666
- Hand stuff, of course.
- Oh, fuck yeah.

37:18.668 --> 37:19.767
- Below the belt?
- Yeah.

37:19.769 --> 37:20.802
Well, where do we draw the line?

37:20.804 --> 37:22.106
Where do you
wanna draw the line?

37:23.239 --> 37:25.039
I don't think
I wanna draw a line.

37:25.041 --> 37:26.344
Color outside the lines.

37:26.842 --> 37:28.742
All right. I'm in.

37:28.744 --> 37:30.945
- It's awesome. Surf's up.
- Surf's up.

37:30.947 --> 37:32.115
We're gonna find our unicorn.

37:33.150 --> 37:34.816
Mm.

37:34.818 --> 37:36.483
Is here all right for you guys?

37:36.485 --> 37:38.186
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:38.188 --> 37:40.554
Got another pick up.
Just gotta make a pit stop.

37:40.556 --> 37:41.956
What is happening?

37:41.958 --> 37:43.023
We're surging.

37:43.025 --> 37:45.327
- You are so cheap.
- I'm saving for us.

37:49.333 --> 37:53.001
Oh, my God, I can tell
you're half-wasted already.

37:53.003 --> 37:54.438
How dare you not wait for me?

37:55.405 --> 37:56.403
You dick.

37:56.405 --> 37:58.706
- What about her?
- Shut up.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.342
- That was a test.
- Shut the fuck up.

38:00.344 --> 38:01.809
- Okay.
- We gotta be on the same page.

38:01.811 --> 38:03.610
I'm sorry, it's my best friend.

38:03.612 --> 38:07.349
Wait for me before you guys
get too crazy. Stop.

38:07.351 --> 38:09.918
Oh, did you pull out
the dick lollipops yet?

38:09.920 --> 38:13.088
- I'm ready, dude. I'm fucking...
- Hey, this, uh, GPS isn't showing.

38:13.090 --> 38:15.623
Is it like a hotel or like a...
Like a bar or something?

38:15.625 --> 38:17.791
It's, like, up here
on the left. You'll see it.

38:17.793 --> 38:19.329
It's like a really sick club.

38:20.664 --> 38:22.463
- Club.
- Yeah, we gotta go club.

38:22.465 --> 38:24.632
- We gotta go to the club.
- I told you to wait for me!

38:24.634 --> 38:25.700
I hate you.

38:25.702 --> 38:27.668
Hey, we're not from around here.

38:27.670 --> 38:29.604
Is it cool if we join you?

38:32.007 --> 38:33.742
Hey, we're with
Hailey's bachelorette.

38:33.744 --> 38:35.146
What is that, a postal code?

38:35.644 --> 38:36.811
"Nioct"?

38:36.813 --> 38:39.012
You guys...
"Intensity."

38:39.014 --> 38:40.180
Fucking duh. Okay?

38:40.182 --> 38:41.950
Just come on. I'm late.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.087
Fucking duh.

38:44.054 --> 38:45.019
Oh, I get it.

39:17.653 --> 39:19.422
I don't know
if we're at the right place.

39:20.389 --> 39:22.624
I'm just enjoying
the atmosphere.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.458
Oh, my God. Loosen up.

39:24.460 --> 39:26.327
- What do you mean?
- It's too hot for you in here.

39:26.329 --> 39:29.164
All these hot guys
with their little booty shorts.

39:29.166 --> 39:31.065
I feel perfectly comfortable.

39:31.067 --> 39:34.101
- Really?
- I appreciate the body as a work of art.

39:34.103 --> 39:35.670
Male and female.

39:35.672 --> 39:37.137
Excellent body, but we're good.

39:37.139 --> 39:38.576
We don't have cash.

39:38.909 --> 39:39.977
No cash.

39:42.846 --> 39:45.079
Oh. You can't handle it.

39:45.081 --> 39:46.914
This is funny to you?

39:46.916 --> 39:49.550
- What?
- This funny to you?

39:49.552 --> 39:51.586
- No.
- Then why are you sitting in the front row,

39:51.588 --> 39:52.920
laughing and not tipping?

39:52.922 --> 39:54.121
We don't have any cash.

39:54.123 --> 39:55.690
Well, then why are you here?

39:55.692 --> 39:57.291
It's a strip club.

39:57.293 --> 39:59.427
If you don't have any money,
then you should leave.

39:59.429 --> 40:00.427
What?

40:00.429 --> 40:03.197
All right. This isn't a joke.
This is N10CT.

40:03.199 --> 40:06.236
People come here
to embrace their sexuality,

40:06.869 --> 40:08.202
as adults.

40:08.204 --> 40:10.007
Not laugh at it like children.

40:10.606 --> 40:12.206
You know,

40:12.208 --> 40:14.244
I feel sorry
for people like you.

40:15.545 --> 40:16.711
So limited.

40:16.713 --> 40:17.782
We just...

40:18.782 --> 40:20.548
I don't know.

40:22.552 --> 40:23.554
Have a better night.

40:24.788 --> 40:26.556
Oh, my God. What was that?

40:32.661 --> 40:33.827
Hey, man. I'm really...

40:33.829 --> 40:35.463
No, I get it. You thought
it'd be funny to come in here.

40:35.465 --> 40:36.731
- No.
- You thought it'd be crazy.

40:36.733 --> 40:38.599
Some sort of crazy story
to tell your friends about

40:38.601 --> 40:40.735
that you went to,
uh, a male strip club.

40:40.737 --> 40:43.304
- It...
- Look, man. No. I don't wanna hear it, okay?

40:43.306 --> 40:45.742
- You gotta stay hydrated.
- Cheers, all!

40:54.451 --> 40:56.550
- It is nothing like that.
- Oh, come on.

40:56.552 --> 40:59.487
You have no idea what it
takes to run this place.

40:59.489 --> 41:00.588
I work my ass off.

41:00.590 --> 41:04.157
I paid for my house in cash.
I have two pools.

41:04.159 --> 41:07.061
I have fucked so many women
in this place.

41:07.063 --> 41:08.231
Wait, you're not gay?

41:08.632 --> 41:09.963
I am.

41:09.965 --> 41:12.266
But I fuck women.

41:12.268 --> 41:13.934
- I mean, I can be gay and fuck women.
- Yeah.

41:13.936 --> 41:15.470
I can be straight
and fuck men. I don't...

41:15.472 --> 41:17.137
- Totally. Of course. No.
- I mean, it's whatever.

41:17.139 --> 41:18.606
We don't have any problem
with your personal life.

41:18.608 --> 41:20.240
Thank you so much.
Thanks for telling me.

41:20.242 --> 41:21.441
Thanks for coming in here,
and letting me know

41:21.443 --> 41:22.776
that you have no problem
with my lifestyle.

41:22.778 --> 41:25.215
- Oh, come on. Let's just go. He's an asshole.
- No. No.

41:26.181 --> 41:27.584
I've had a gay experience.

41:28.652 --> 41:30.450
- What?
- It was a boy.

41:30.452 --> 41:31.219
- Ew.
- No.

41:31.221 --> 41:32.452
That's not a gay experience.

41:32.454 --> 41:34.755
No, I was a boy. We both...
We both were boys.

41:34.757 --> 41:36.791
What are you talking about?

41:36.793 --> 41:38.860
- I've never told you this story before?
- No.

41:38.862 --> 41:41.229
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm pretty sure.

41:41.231 --> 41:43.467
Oh. Well, now you gotta tell us.

41:46.936 --> 41:48.302
Um...

41:48.304 --> 41:50.640
Well, his... His name
was Corey Crown. We...

41:51.407 --> 41:52.907
lived in the same neighborhood,

41:52.909 --> 41:55.142
and we would play <i>Shinobi III,</i>
and rollerblade after school.

41:55.144 --> 41:58.278
One day we were at his house and we'd
stolen his brother's <i>Green Day</i> CD,

41:58.280 --> 42:02.282
so we were just dancing around in
his room, just having a great time,

42:02.284 --> 42:04.420
and I don't know
how it started happening, but...

42:05.255 --> 42:06.724
our clothing
started to come off.

42:07.423 --> 42:08.659
And then we were naked.

42:10.193 --> 42:13.161
Dancing around naked,
and it was fun.

42:13.163 --> 42:15.829
And it was also scary,
and felt wrong,

42:15.831 --> 42:18.733
but it didn't matter.

42:18.735 --> 42:21.271
And then I noticed that something
was going on with his weiner.

42:22.505 --> 42:23.474
And that...

42:24.407 --> 42:26.309
something was going on
with my weiner, too.

42:26.643 --> 42:27.610
What?

42:28.577 --> 42:29.612
We had boners.

42:30.146 --> 42:31.545
Okay.

42:31.547 --> 42:33.146
I mean, everything kind of
gives you a boner at that age.

42:33.148 --> 42:37.217
Oh, there's a lot of cartoon shit
out there that can get you hard.

42:37.219 --> 42:39.387
Anyway, so, we just
kind of stood there,

42:39.389 --> 42:41.588
and stared at our little penises
for a while,

42:41.590 --> 42:45.892
and then we just inched
closer and closer together

42:45.894 --> 42:50.333
until we were face to face, and
our little penises were eye to eye.

42:51.635 --> 42:53.233
And then what?

42:53.235 --> 42:57.273
And then we just touched
them together for a bit.

42:58.173 --> 43:00.575
I mean, that's it.
You docked penises?

43:00.577 --> 43:01.943
We didn't dock them,
we touched them, and...

43:01.945 --> 43:04.177
- You just touched them together?
- Touched them together.

43:04.179 --> 43:05.646
You kissed your boners together.

43:05.648 --> 43:07.414
I'm saying something very
vulnerable here, and you're...

43:07.416 --> 43:09.117
No, no, it's amazing.

43:09.119 --> 43:10.651
I... I can't believe it.

43:10.653 --> 43:13.621
Anyway, then his brother
busted in, and yelled at us,

43:13.623 --> 43:17.557
and took his CD back, and we never
really talked about it ever again.

43:17.559 --> 43:19.395
And I think, just being here...

43:20.295 --> 43:22.030
brought that up,
and I was laughing,

43:22.032 --> 43:25.199
because these guys are
intimidating, and I was intimidated.

43:25.201 --> 43:27.403
So I laughed. So I'm sorry.

43:27.936 --> 43:30.204
Okay, okay. It's fine.

43:30.206 --> 43:31.375
Forget about it.

43:32.007 --> 43:32.909
I'm Tyson.

43:33.677 --> 43:35.211
- I'm Cal.
- Mal.

43:36.311 --> 43:38.179
That's cute.

43:38.181 --> 43:39.782
Shots?

43:42.284 --> 43:45.519
Compared to you, I mean,
I was a late bloomer.

43:45.521 --> 43:49.057
I... For me, my first time
was in high school.

43:49.059 --> 43:51.224
Oh, my God.
Tell this story.

43:51.226 --> 43:53.760
His name was Hugh Turner,

43:53.762 --> 43:57.699
and he was the captain
of the boys' lacrosse team.

43:57.701 --> 43:59.166
Oh.

43:59.168 --> 44:03.438
And he sucked me off in Coach Clark's
office one day after practice.

44:03.440 --> 44:05.405
- Well, it's a quicker story than yours.
- Yes.

44:05.407 --> 44:06.743
It was one of the most...

44:08.844 --> 44:12.179
erotic experiences of my life.

44:12.181 --> 44:13.815
I can still feel it right now.

44:13.817 --> 44:16.717
Wow. And that's when
you knew that you were gay?

44:16.719 --> 44:18.151
Ugh! What?

44:18.153 --> 44:24.291
No. Why are you so bent on figuring
out whether I'm gay or not,

44:24.293 --> 44:27.260
or when I found out I was gay.

44:27.262 --> 44:29.197
Gay, bi, poly...

44:29.199 --> 44:31.065
What's with these labels?
Don't label me.

44:31.067 --> 44:34.302
And don't label yourselves.

44:34.304 --> 44:36.369
No, I dated a girl
in college, actually, so...

44:36.371 --> 44:38.805
Really? So that's when
you knew you were gay.

44:38.807 --> 44:41.441
- Right.
- Did you guys have sex?

44:41.443 --> 44:43.443
No, I mean, we...
We just made out.

44:43.445 --> 44:45.581
- A couple of times.
- Mm. Okay. And how long did that

44:46.215 --> 44:47.315
go on for?

44:47.317 --> 44:49.016
I believe I went on,
like, a few dates.

44:49.018 --> 44:50.184
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

44:50.186 --> 44:51.952
Oh, I thought
it was just one date.

44:51.954 --> 44:54.856
Yeah, it was a couple dates, but it
was nothing. It wasn't a big deal.

44:54.858 --> 44:57.258
It was so dumb.

44:57.260 --> 44:59.559
Yeah, so you both
have had a little...

44:59.561 --> 45:01.898
- A little... A little taste.
- Yeah.

45:03.932 --> 45:06.501
So, you don't even really,
like, have to dance anymore?

45:06.503 --> 45:09.670
No, I don't.
I mean, I love to dance, but...

45:09.672 --> 45:11.742
You know, I only do it
on a special occasion.

45:13.208 --> 45:16.110
Hmm, well,
tonight's a special occasion.

45:16.112 --> 45:17.081
Hmm...

45:18.947 --> 45:20.414
- Is it?
- Yeah.

45:20.416 --> 45:22.452
Mm, I guess it is.

45:23.952 --> 45:24.855
Cheers.

45:37.599 --> 45:38.568
Yes.

45:40.603 --> 45:43.403
You know that, uh, the CD's
<i>Now That's What I Call Music?</i>

45:43.405 --> 45:45.206
Uh-huh.

45:45.208 --> 45:46.941
- That's from this?
- Is that what this is?

45:46.943 --> 45:50.010
No, but I'm just thinking,
"Now that's what I call music."

45:50.012 --> 45:51.345
Wow.

45:51.347 --> 45:55.516
Hey, Tyson, I gotta say this
place is so incredibly impressive.

45:55.518 --> 45:56.883
I mean,
you have your own business,

45:56.885 --> 45:59.623
you get to do
what you wanna do every night.

46:00.155 --> 46:01.924
I am jealous of you.

46:03.092 --> 46:04.191
You should be.

46:04.193 --> 46:05.626
It's incredible.

46:05.628 --> 46:07.295
- It's so awesome.
- It's awesome.

46:07.297 --> 46:10.498
- I think it's amazing.
- My life is better than anybody else's I know.

46:10.500 --> 46:13.871
There's literally no downside
to what I do.

46:15.170 --> 46:16.137
It shows.

46:16.139 --> 46:17.170
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

46:17.172 --> 46:19.507
Well, you're welcome
here anytime.

46:19.509 --> 46:21.675
If you'd like to audition,
you're more than welcome.

46:21.677 --> 46:24.345
- Oh.
- Uh, nope, I can't do that.

46:24.347 --> 46:26.046
Stop it. Yes, you could.

46:26.048 --> 46:28.014
- No.
- Yes, you could.

46:28.016 --> 46:30.550
Oh, yeah, if I had time
to train, and all that,

46:30.552 --> 46:32.686
but, like, I...
There's no way I could do

46:32.688 --> 46:33.954
- what you guys do.
- Oh, yes, you could.

46:33.956 --> 46:35.655
- I mean, I would get better over time.
- Yeah.

46:35.657 --> 46:37.023
What are you...
What are you saying?

46:37.025 --> 46:38.025
You could, you couldn't?

46:38.027 --> 46:39.492
I don't think I could do it,
but if I had...

46:39.494 --> 46:41.397
I think you could,
but you're just afraid to.

46:42.264 --> 46:43.396
Aren't you?

46:43.398 --> 46:44.500
A little...

46:45.235 --> 46:47.001
apprehenxious.

46:47.003 --> 46:47.901
Do you know what that is?

46:47.903 --> 46:50.007
It's a little anxious
and apprehensive.

46:52.675 --> 46:56.110
- Oh.
- Yeah, come here. It's easy. I'll teach you.

46:56.112 --> 46:57.478
- Get up, Cal.
- Get up.

46:57.480 --> 46:58.545
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

46:58.547 --> 46:59.613
Mmm...

46:59.615 --> 47:01.048
- Yeah.
- Come here.

47:01.050 --> 47:03.016
All right, just give me a
little dance to start off with.

47:06.588 --> 47:08.521
Stop that. Stop that.
Don't do that.

47:08.523 --> 47:09.990
Don't do that. Shh. Hey.

47:09.992 --> 47:11.825
Stop. Hey.

47:11.827 --> 47:13.461
Come here.
Come here. Shh.

47:13.463 --> 47:14.561
Start small.

47:14.563 --> 47:16.597
- Real small, real slow.
- Real small?

47:16.599 --> 47:18.132
Ooh, yeah.

47:18.134 --> 47:20.568
Good. Sensual body of yours.

47:20.570 --> 47:22.336
Oh, you got a great body.

47:22.338 --> 47:23.436
Thank you. You are very...

47:23.438 --> 47:25.072
- He's very strong.
- Yeah.

47:25.074 --> 47:27.041
- Well, that's good.
- All bodies are great.

47:27.043 --> 47:28.642
Just gotta learn
how to appreciate them.

47:28.644 --> 47:30.211
- That's such a nice thing to say.
- Yeah.

47:30.213 --> 47:32.149
Now, start to move that hip.

47:33.148 --> 47:34.749
- There you go.
- Going around.

47:34.751 --> 47:35.816
Mm-hmm.

47:35.818 --> 47:38.019
Pretend like you got
a hula hoop around that...

47:38.021 --> 47:39.186
Very slow. Very...

47:39.188 --> 47:41.322
Heavy, heavy hula hoops.

47:41.324 --> 47:42.856
It's filled with water.
It's just...

47:42.858 --> 47:44.825
Just splashing
that around.

47:44.827 --> 47:47.494
Hula hoop so heavy.

47:47.496 --> 47:50.067
You can't let that
touch the ground.

47:51.034 --> 47:51.932
Do it like he's doing it.

47:51.934 --> 47:53.668
- Like, really smooth.
- I am trying.

47:53.670 --> 47:55.269
- Anybody can do it.
- It...

47:55.271 --> 47:57.804
You just gotta move your body in
a way that you never have before.

47:57.806 --> 47:59.773
It is just like letting go.

47:59.775 --> 48:00.541
Yes.

48:00.543 --> 48:01.608
- You know?
- Yes.

48:01.610 --> 48:03.110
Oh. Come on, Cal.

48:03.112 --> 48:04.545
Smooth. Smooth.

48:04.547 --> 48:06.746
You gotta believe that
you're the sexiest man alive.

48:06.748 --> 48:09.083
- Fuck yeah.
- And that wand between your legs?

48:09.085 --> 48:11.452
- Yeah? What about it?
- Sexiest thing in the world.

48:11.454 --> 48:13.454
- Yeah?
- And everybody wants it.

48:13.456 --> 48:15.626
Look at her with your cock.

48:16.693 --> 48:18.124
- Ooh.
- Ooh, yeah.

48:18.126 --> 48:19.695
- Get over here.
- Yeah.

48:20.563 --> 48:22.095
Ooh, yeah.

48:22.097 --> 48:23.664
- Go for it, Cal.
- Yeah?

48:23.666 --> 48:25.132
- Yeah.
- Okay.

48:25.134 --> 48:26.499
This is my fantasy.

48:28.503 --> 48:30.637
Now we're all
dancing together, right?

48:30.639 --> 48:32.606
- Yeah.
- Ooh, give it to him.

48:32.608 --> 48:33.974
Yeah.

48:36.878 --> 48:38.713
- Feel good? That's fun?
- Yeah.

48:38.715 --> 48:40.014
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:40.016 --> 48:41.715
- Now be a little naughty.
- Oh. Oh.

48:41.717 --> 48:43.717
Now you're
tossing it around.

48:43.719 --> 48:45.588
Yeah.

48:48.690 --> 48:50.257
Whoa!

48:51.427 --> 48:53.864
Whee!

48:54.597 --> 48:56.363
Yeah, just let go.

48:56.365 --> 48:58.432
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

48:58.434 --> 48:59.833
This is amazing.

48:59.835 --> 49:03.139
- It's so fun.
- Oh, my God. Keep it going.

49:05.675 --> 49:07.340
Oh, just let go.

49:07.342 --> 49:09.376
My hands become your hands.

49:13.215 --> 49:15.383
- Oh, that's so...
- Get in there. Yeah.

49:15.385 --> 49:18.084
- Yeah, you want me to be a naughty boy?
- Tell me what you're gonna do.

49:18.086 --> 49:18.985
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

49:18.987 --> 49:20.387
- Oh!
- Yeah, what you wanna do?

49:20.389 --> 49:22.423
- Oh, you're going down.
- Wanna be naughty? Be naughty.

49:22.425 --> 49:25.492
- You've just been playing around.
- Ooh, you've been bad.

49:25.494 --> 49:27.028
Ooh... Uh-oh.

49:27.030 --> 49:28.162
Ooh, suck that.

49:28.164 --> 49:30.296
- Yeah.
- Suck that. Don't bite it. Suck that.

49:30.298 --> 49:32.099
There you go. There you go.

49:33.503 --> 49:36.269
You playing around? You
messing around? You gonna do this?

49:36.271 --> 49:38.671
- Huh? You want him to do this?
- Yeah, I want him to.

49:38.673 --> 49:40.106
- Yeah, I want him to do this.
- Whatever he wants to do.

49:40.108 --> 49:41.842
- Do whatever you want. Do it.
- Do whatever you want.

49:41.844 --> 49:43.677
- I'm gonna do this.
- That's good.

49:43.679 --> 49:45.945
- What do you want?
- All right. You want me to...

49:45.947 --> 49:48.516
- Oh, yeah.
- You just... You want me to put it in my mouth?

49:48.518 --> 49:50.617
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, I feel good.

49:50.619 --> 49:51.584
- Yeah, grab it.
- Wait, what...

49:51.586 --> 49:52.720
- I feel good.
- Oh, my...

49:52.722 --> 49:54.421
- Suck on it. Suck on it.
- Okay. Stop, stop.

49:54.423 --> 49:55.826
- Whoa.
- Stop, stop...

49:56.559 --> 49:57.992
What are you doing?

49:57.994 --> 50:00.026
I... I'm just
doing what you told me to do.

50:00.028 --> 50:01.762
No, I only wanted you to do
what you wanted.

50:01.764 --> 50:03.264
You said this was your fantasy.

50:03.266 --> 50:05.766
No, it's not my fantasy.
I thought it was your fantasy.

50:05.768 --> 50:08.469
- Oh, no, I don't want to...
- If you don't wanna do it, you don't have to do it.

50:08.471 --> 50:09.804
Great. We don't have to do it.

50:09.806 --> 50:11.838
But you were so into it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Ty...

50:11.840 --> 50:13.673
- No, I was just feeling...
- No, don't be sorry.

50:13.675 --> 50:16.177
This is confusing.
You guys are figuring it out.

50:16.179 --> 50:17.878
- I'm sorry.
- You're doing a great job.

50:17.880 --> 50:19.345
- It's fine.
- I'm so sorry.

50:19.347 --> 50:22.083
- We led you on.
- Look, this happens all the time.

50:22.085 --> 50:23.184
- It does?
- Yeah.

50:23.186 --> 50:25.019
I'm sorry if we...

50:25.021 --> 50:26.287
I didn't even...

50:26.289 --> 50:28.188
- I thought that...
- You said you were kinda gay, I thought...

50:28.190 --> 50:29.757
- This is a big part, and you became anxious.
- I'm... I guess I'm not...

50:29.759 --> 50:30.990
I thought this was your
big chance to suck a dick.

50:30.992 --> 50:33.726
- Hey.
- I don't need... even need that chance.

50:33.728 --> 50:35.295
Yeah, I know.

50:35.297 --> 50:37.764
I'm glad we stopped before you
did something you didn't wanna do.

50:37.766 --> 50:39.233
- Thank you.
- Look at that.

50:39.235 --> 50:41.168
- Cool.
- What do you say we get some drinks?

50:41.170 --> 50:43.436
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, that'd be great.

50:43.438 --> 50:45.274
- That'd be great.
- Man, I came twice.

50:46.541 --> 50:48.476
- What's that?
- What?

50:48.478 --> 50:51.545
I get
so fucking exhausted.

50:53.615 --> 50:57.517
- Okay.
- Okay, so you guys are completely committed to this?

50:57.519 --> 50:59.385
- Yeah...
- Well...

50:59.387 --> 51:00.753
Yes, we are.

51:00.755 --> 51:02.490
- We do... Yeah, we're serious.
- Yes. Yeah.

51:02.492 --> 51:04.858
Mm, you need a professional.

51:04.860 --> 51:07.129
- Like you?
- No, I'm a dancer.

51:08.463 --> 51:10.664
You need a professional.

51:10.666 --> 51:13.166
She's incredible. I've known her for years.

51:13.168 --> 51:14.904
And if you're looking
for a threesome...

51:16.271 --> 51:17.637
this is your girl.

51:19.474 --> 51:21.242
Is she a prostitute?

51:21.244 --> 51:22.412
No, not a 'tute.

51:23.211 --> 51:24.744
A top-notch escort.

51:24.746 --> 51:27.884
We're talking upper-echelon
female companionship.

51:28.351 --> 51:29.219
Give her a call.

51:29.818 --> 51:31.151
She'll take care of you.

51:32.487 --> 51:33.820
Okay.

51:33.822 --> 51:35.255
- We're locked and loaded.
- Mm-hmm.

51:35.257 --> 51:36.690
We can't turn back.

51:36.692 --> 51:38.159
- No.
- Can't turn back.

51:38.161 --> 51:39.526
Just gonna talk to her and figure it out.

51:39.528 --> 51:41.061
- Mm-hmm.
- I will talk to her.

51:41.063 --> 51:43.097
It's just like calling and making
an appointment for a haircut.

51:43.099 --> 51:45.432
"Hey, will you come
suck my dick? Cool. Bye."

51:45.434 --> 51:47.066
And, lift off.

51:47.068 --> 51:48.936
<i>Hi, you've reached April.</i>

51:48.938 --> 51:50.037
- <i>Leave a message.</i>
- I can't do it. You have to do it.

51:50.039 --> 51:51.438
- What? No.
- Yeah, talk.

51:51.440 --> 51:52.706
Just...

51:52.708 --> 51:55.041
Hi, this is Mary.

51:55.043 --> 51:57.945
And I got your number
from Tyson, so, um,

51:57.947 --> 51:59.813
if you wanna just
give me a call,

51:59.815 --> 52:01.815
that would be great, baby.

52:01.817 --> 52:03.117
What?

52:03.119 --> 52:04.617
- That was great.
- Why did I say "baby"?

52:04.619 --> 52:06.887
You said "baby," and that means
you're cool and you're friendly.

52:06.889 --> 52:08.688
Feel like I'm some kinda
old jazz musician.

52:08.690 --> 52:10.291
- Little bit, but...
- "Yeah, baby."

52:10.293 --> 52:11.891
I wouldn't have said
"baby," honestly.

52:11.893 --> 52:13.760
- But this is the...
- "Put it on the snare."

52:13.762 --> 52:15.095
That's fine. It's done.

52:15.097 --> 52:17.231
- Great.
- It's done. It's a waiting game.

52:17.233 --> 52:19.465
- Do you have any cash?
- I got like 40 bucks.

52:19.467 --> 52:20.501
Well, it's not enough.

52:20.503 --> 52:21.802
How do you know?

52:21.804 --> 52:23.704
'Cause Julia Roberts
costs, like, $3,000 for a night.

52:23.706 --> 52:24.871
Like, the real Julia Roberts?

52:24.873 --> 52:26.139
In <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

52:26.141 --> 52:29.008
No, no. Prostitutes operate
on a sliding scale.

52:29.010 --> 52:30.778
It's not low-income housing.

52:30.780 --> 52:33.680
In <i>Pretty Woman,</i> she says $3,000
because Richard Gere picks her up

52:33.682 --> 52:35.682
in, like, a sports car and takes
her to a really nice hotel.

52:35.684 --> 52:38.818
But if you were to pick her up in a Honda
Civic, and take her to some shit hotel,

52:38.820 --> 52:40.320
she would get a lot less money.

52:40.322 --> 52:42.289
- Well, okay, should we look more poor, or something?
- Yeah.

52:42.291 --> 52:43.757
- Should we hide the laptop?
- Definitely.

52:43.759 --> 52:45.258
You shouldn't have
washed your balls.

52:45.260 --> 52:46.126
I know, I...

52:46.128 --> 52:47.126
I think we're losing focus here.

52:47.128 --> 52:48.662
No. Yeah, totally. Totally.

52:48.664 --> 52:52.035
Okay, I have 300 bucks in the car.
It's for emergencies only.

52:52.501 --> 52:53.601
Why?

52:53.603 --> 52:54.901
It's in my bug-out bag.

52:54.903 --> 52:56.269
Oh, my God,
like, your zombie bag?

52:56.271 --> 52:58.171
You told me
you stopped doing that.

52:58.173 --> 52:59.840
I told you I stopped doing that because
you kept making fun of me for doing that.

52:59.842 --> 53:01.474
Well, yeah, you wanted
to hide a gun in the yard.

53:01.476 --> 53:04.043
And as far as you know, I still
have not buried a gun in the yard.

53:04.045 --> 53:06.914
What I'm trying to say is,
we have 340 bucks to work with.

53:06.916 --> 53:08.581
That's good.

53:08.583 --> 53:09.786
Oh. Shit. Fuck.

53:11.721 --> 53:12.889
Hello?

53:13.956 --> 53:16.356
<i>Hi, um, is this Mary?</i>

53:16.358 --> 53:17.358
- No.
- Yes.

53:17.360 --> 53:18.925
Oh. Yeah, sorry. Um...

53:18.927 --> 53:20.529
Yeah, Tyson gave us your number.

53:22.164 --> 53:26.633
<i>"Us"? Um, how many
of you are there?</i>

53:26.635 --> 53:29.702
Just two. It's just my boyfriend and me.
My fiance.

53:29.704 --> 53:32.139
- Yo.
- That's him. He just said, "Yo."

53:32.141 --> 53:34.411
Um, we were just wondering
if you wanted to party.

53:36.311 --> 53:38.811
<i>Um, party. Uh, okay.</i>

53:38.813 --> 53:42.816
<i>Uh, well, I provide
incall massage services.</i>

53:42.818 --> 53:44.717
- Yes, that's a code.
- Okay. Yeah, that's great.

53:44.719 --> 53:46.420
<i>Okay, um, where are you at?</i>

53:46.422 --> 53:49.289
Actually, um, I was wondering
how much it costs.

53:49.291 --> 53:51.325
<i>Well, it's $150
for a couple's massage,</i>

53:51.327 --> 53:55.061
<i>and after that,
it's sort of a sliding scale.</i>

53:55.063 --> 53:56.396
That's what I said.
That's what I said!

53:56.398 --> 53:58.898
- That's what I said.
- Okay, great. Great. Um...

53:58.900 --> 54:01.135
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah, let's do that.

54:01.137 --> 54:03.537
<i>Okay. Um, well,
text me your address,</i>

54:03.539 --> 54:06.472
<i>and I'll let you know
when I'm on my way.</i>

54:06.474 --> 54:08.508
<i>Also, if there's
a fucking bachelor party,</i>

54:08.510 --> 54:11.445
<i>or a fucking rubber fist
or anything, I bounce.</i>

54:11.447 --> 54:14.985
No, totally. We don't have
a rubber fist. We're cool.

54:16.152 --> 54:19.119
<i>I'm teasing. Sorry.
Okay, I'll see you soon.</i>

54:19.121 --> 54:21.954
Totally... Okay, bye.

54:24.293 --> 54:25.659
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

54:25.661 --> 54:28.262
- She actually sounded pretty sweet.
- Very sweet. I'm drinking.

54:28.264 --> 54:29.496
Wait, you're gonna get
whiskey dick.

54:29.498 --> 54:32.034
Yeah, I need whiskey dick
if I'm gonna perform.

54:34.003 --> 54:35.735
We gotta get this place set up.

54:35.737 --> 54:37.070
This place is, like,
way too bright.

54:37.072 --> 54:38.438
- It is too bright. It's too bright.
- We need candles.

54:38.440 --> 54:40.206
- Oh, wait.
- We need some fucking candles.

54:40.208 --> 54:41.708
We can't have candles. It's a hotel.

54:41.710 --> 54:43.376
- They don't let you.
- What?

54:43.378 --> 54:45.311
They don't let you have candles in
a hotel 'cause you'll burn it down.

54:45.313 --> 54:47.847
Okay, well, we gotta put, like,
shirts on these things, or something.

54:47.849 --> 54:49.583
That's a fire hazard, too.

54:49.585 --> 54:51.784
No, these are LEDs. They give off very
little heat and they last forever.

54:51.786 --> 54:53.354
- Just like your whiskey dick.
- Yes.

54:53.356 --> 54:54.987
- Okay, great. Um...
- This one, too.

54:54.989 --> 54:56.222
- You need to calm down.
- What?

54:56.224 --> 54:58.157
Why don't you get the ice,
and go get the cash,

54:58.159 --> 55:00.293
- and I'll make this, like, a sex palace?
- Okay.

55:00.295 --> 55:02.662
- Okay. Okay.
- Yeah, ice and cash. That's great.

55:02.664 --> 55:03.666
Oh, wait. What do you think?

55:04.766 --> 55:07.333
- These guys.
- Um, um... I don't know.

55:07.335 --> 55:08.901
Fucking...

55:08.903 --> 55:10.670
- That looks so crazy. I don't know. Make it stop.
- What? Like, crazy good?

55:10.672 --> 55:11.972
- No, bad.
- What?

55:11.974 --> 55:13.740
- Off... On...
- Stop. Off or on?

55:13.742 --> 55:14.941
- Off.
- Off.

55:14.943 --> 55:16.275
Okay. Off it is.

55:16.277 --> 55:17.978
All right. Getting ice,
getting money. I'll be back.

55:17.980 --> 55:19.713
- "Get it money"?
- Getting money.

55:19.715 --> 55:21.351
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. And get it, babe.

55:37.400 --> 55:39.702
Ice, ice baby!

55:43.905 --> 55:45.572
Cally-Cal!

55:45.574 --> 55:46.940
- Oh, shit.
- Charlie.

55:46.942 --> 55:49.008
Uh, yeah. We're good.

55:49.010 --> 55:50.978
- Hey, hey, hey.
- How's it going on, man?

55:50.980 --> 55:52.545
- Sit, sit, sit.
- No, I can't. I gotta...

55:52.547 --> 55:54.914
- No, no, no. Sit, sit. Sit down. Sit down.
- I really gotta run.

55:54.916 --> 55:56.316
I...
What's going on?

55:56.318 --> 55:59.353
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Shh! I snuck out.

55:59.355 --> 56:01.789
- I don't need your permission?
- Okay.

56:01.791 --> 56:03.059
Dude, don't...

56:04.092 --> 56:05.661
Um, are you okay?

56:06.195 --> 56:07.263
Is everything okay?

56:07.797 --> 56:08.929
Everything's fine.

56:08.931 --> 56:10.496
- Okay.
- No, it's not.

56:10.498 --> 56:12.365
But, hey, things happen.

56:12.367 --> 56:14.200
All right.
It's, like, so late, man.

56:14.202 --> 56:15.405
Katie cheated on me.

56:17.840 --> 56:19.008
On you?

56:19.608 --> 56:20.407
Fucking crazy.

56:20.409 --> 56:21.974
- On you?
- Look at me.

56:21.976 --> 56:24.211
- What the fuck is wrong with her?
- I'm a fucking beast of a man.

56:24.213 --> 56:25.445
She cheated on you?

56:25.447 --> 56:27.079
- Can't make no sense of that.
- That's...

56:27.081 --> 56:29.883
- She's out of her goddamn mind.
- She is, right?

56:29.885 --> 56:33.954
- What the fuck is that...
- I cheated on her, though, first.

56:33.956 --> 56:38.458
But, you know, we were separated, so is
that really cheating? Come on.

56:39.295 --> 56:40.663
I should make us
some drinks, huh?

56:41.630 --> 56:43.095
Think I'm gonna hide my purse.

56:43.097 --> 56:45.067
Or like...

56:45.835 --> 56:47.170
You never know.

56:49.871 --> 56:51.338
Oh.

56:51.340 --> 56:53.576
- Hi.
- It's like our marriage was, um...

56:54.342 --> 56:55.744
What's that word for "fake"?

56:56.512 --> 56:58.244
- Uh, sham.
- No, no.

56:58.246 --> 57:00.746
- Uh, phoney. Lie.
- No, no, no.

57:00.748 --> 57:02.215
- It's fucking... The word.
- Um...

57:02.217 --> 57:03.650
- Let's get it.
- False.

57:03.652 --> 57:05.054
No, fuck it. Fake.

57:05.920 --> 57:08.157
- Our marriage was a fake.
- No.

57:08.556 --> 57:09.655
Yeah.

57:09.657 --> 57:11.391
Well, where... I mean,
you guys worked it out.

57:11.393 --> 57:13.025
You guys are back together.

57:13.027 --> 57:16.963
- You're good.
- Yeah, yeah. When we found out Katie was pregnant,

57:16.965 --> 57:19.365
we decided that
we were gonna work it out.

57:19.367 --> 57:21.036
So I decided to move back in.

57:23.606 --> 57:26.443
You found out she was pregnant
while you were separated?

57:27.409 --> 57:28.445
Yes.

57:29.043 --> 57:30.312
I knew you were smart.

57:31.246 --> 57:33.813
- Oh, my God.
- "Oh, my God" is right.

57:33.815 --> 57:35.615
- Well, that's...
- Those two babies,

57:35.617 --> 57:38.221
inside of her,
they might not be mine.

57:39.454 --> 57:41.588
Hopefully, like, one of them is.

57:41.590 --> 57:44.057
I mean, that's not
how it works, but...

57:44.059 --> 57:46.025
- Maybe.
- ...it could be yours, right?

57:46.027 --> 57:47.860
Yeah, we were still fucking.

57:47.862 --> 57:49.463
All right. That's good.

57:49.465 --> 57:52.168
But, I mean, it's hard not to
think about the alternative, right?

57:53.969 --> 57:55.371
Yeah. What are you...

57:56.038 --> 57:57.373
What are you guys gonna do?

57:57.972 --> 57:59.438
What are you gonna do?

57:59.440 --> 58:02.376
I'm gonna continue
to love my wife,

58:02.378 --> 58:04.347
because she means
the world to me.

58:05.079 --> 58:07.079
And I decided that

58:07.081 --> 58:09.516
we are gonna raise
those kids together

58:09.518 --> 58:12.222
no matter whose they are,
and that's it.

58:13.755 --> 58:16.326
I think you're gonna
be okay, Charlie. Okay?

58:17.226 --> 58:19.659
Oh, hey, Caleb,
I love you, man.

58:19.661 --> 58:21.295
I love you too, bud.

58:21.297 --> 58:26.135
And one day, if you ever decide to marry
my beautiful, incredible sister-in-law,

58:26.902 --> 58:28.271
we're gonna be family.

58:29.538 --> 58:30.572
We will.

58:31.773 --> 58:32.875
- We will be.
- Brothers.

58:33.541 --> 58:34.374
Brothers.

58:34.376 --> 58:36.008
Wait, where is Malory?

58:36.010 --> 58:37.311
I... I have to go.

58:37.313 --> 58:38.679
- Where is she?
- I'm so sorry. She's in the room.

58:38.681 --> 58:40.380
- Oh, my God. Go, go, go.
- What are you gonna do?

58:40.382 --> 58:42.648
- I'ma sleep out here. Under the stars.
- All right.

58:42.650 --> 58:44.851
- Go, go, go. Get back to what you were doing.
- Hey, look, I got you a blanket.

58:44.853 --> 58:46.456
Got me a blanket.

58:47.222 --> 58:48.921
- Ooh, yeah.
- Take care, buddy.

58:48.923 --> 58:49.990
- See you tomorrow.
- Love you, Charlie.

58:49.992 --> 58:51.194
Love you too, man.

58:52.061 --> 58:53.492
Facade!

58:53.494 --> 58:54.693
What?

58:54.695 --> 58:56.766
That's the word we were
trying to figure out. "Facade."

58:57.599 --> 58:58.798
Facade, yes.

58:58.800 --> 58:59.800
Yes, good word.

58:59.802 --> 59:01.671
Yeah, that's a very good word.

59:05.940 --> 59:09.611
Um, so, I don't really know
if this is, like, the best idea.

59:12.081 --> 59:13.283
Did you clog the toilet?

59:18.186 --> 59:19.753
Cal, this is April.

59:19.755 --> 59:20.823
April, Cal.

59:21.523 --> 59:22.392
Mmm.

59:24.793 --> 59:25.958
Hi, April.

59:25.960 --> 59:28.195
I'm Mal. Cal. I am Cal.

59:28.197 --> 59:29.666
Caleb. "Cal" is fine.

59:30.065 --> 59:31.365
"Cal" is fine.

59:31.367 --> 59:32.268
Hi.

59:34.369 --> 59:36.172
- Hi, Cal.
- Oh, yeah.

59:38.474 --> 59:39.442
Hi.

59:43.545 --> 59:44.914
I don't know. Drinks?

59:48.884 --> 59:50.349
- And...
- Yeah.

59:50.351 --> 59:51.920
Now we all know each other.

59:54.856 --> 59:55.789
Great.

59:55.791 --> 59:57.657
You got... That was
really good timing.

59:57.659 --> 59:59.561
That was very fast.

01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:09.469
Wait, why are you guys in town?

01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:11.804
Oh, my parents
are renewing their vows.

01:00:11.806 --> 01:00:13.606
Oh, that's cute.

01:00:13.608 --> 01:00:17.510
Yeah, it's kind of torture
though, but it's cute.

01:00:17.512 --> 01:00:19.845
Yeah, but you guys don't
have to worry about that now.

01:00:19.847 --> 01:00:21.380
We're not cops.

01:00:21.382 --> 01:00:24.083
- What?
- Uh... We're not cops.

01:00:24.085 --> 01:00:26.052
We hate cops.
Malory really hates them.

01:00:26.054 --> 01:00:29.055
I mean, it's fine, I know all
the cops in this town, anyway.

01:00:29.057 --> 01:00:30.523
- Yeah.
- I grew up here.

01:00:30.525 --> 01:00:31.791
It's a pretty small town.

01:00:31.793 --> 01:00:33.894
I mean, a lot of the cops
are old family friends.

01:00:33.896 --> 01:00:36.662
Oh, cool. I don't, like,
hate cops. I mean...

01:00:36.664 --> 01:00:38.597
Just... I was texting
at a stoplight once,

01:00:38.599 --> 01:00:41.333
and I got a ticket
for $400, so...

01:00:41.335 --> 01:00:42.938
- I mean, I'm holding a grudge.
- Right.

01:00:43.405 --> 01:00:44.673
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.206
This is our first time.

01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:49.342
- I can tell.
- Yeah.

01:00:49.344 --> 01:00:51.010
- It's cool.
- Cool.

01:00:51.012 --> 01:00:52.014
Cool, cool.

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:56.550
Well...

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:59.286
- Oh, my God. Same nail polish.
- Oh, wow. Crazy.

01:00:59.288 --> 01:01:00.454
Cheers.

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:01.891
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

01:01:02.257 --> 01:01:03.358
Uh-huh.

01:01:09.097 --> 01:01:10.731
Malory and I will

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:12.865
get our nails painted together.
I'll just do, like, a clear coat.

01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:15.235
Sometimes he gets
his toe painted gold.

01:01:15.237 --> 01:01:17.670
I do.
I do that.

01:01:17.672 --> 01:01:20.173
I just started getting my big
toe painted for, like, good luck,

01:01:20.175 --> 01:01:22.208
and my little secret,
or something.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.012
Mm-hmm. That's rad.

01:01:26.614 --> 01:01:28.450
So, where do you guys
wanna do it?

01:01:31.119 --> 01:01:31.987
Do what?

01:01:32.554 --> 01:01:34.322
- The massage.
- Oh.

01:01:34.822 --> 01:01:35.757
Um...

01:01:37.826 --> 01:01:38.724
- Wherever.
- The bed?

01:01:38.726 --> 01:01:40.193
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Or wherever.

01:01:40.195 --> 01:01:41.728
Or, you know, the bed.

01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:44.798
- Right?
- That seems to make sense to me.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.469
Who wants to go first?

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:49.672
I do.

01:01:50.838 --> 01:01:52.204
Okay.

01:01:52.206 --> 01:01:53.643
Cool. Okay.

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:55.945
Leading off, Malory.

01:02:00.014 --> 01:02:01.481
How is that?

01:02:04.119 --> 01:02:05.385
Do you like that?

01:02:05.387 --> 01:02:06.522
Mm-hmm.

01:02:07.456 --> 01:02:08.921
You like it soft?

01:02:11.659 --> 01:02:15.431
Oh, your skin is perfection.

01:02:15.963 --> 01:02:17.432
This feels amazing.

01:02:41.289 --> 01:02:42.557
Come over here.

01:02:44.193 --> 01:02:45.492
Yeah.

01:02:45.494 --> 01:02:46.796
Don't be shy.

01:02:55.204 --> 01:02:56.139
Here.

01:03:07.181 --> 01:03:08.450
Sorry.

01:03:10.751 --> 01:03:11.851
You should do behind her knees.

01:03:11.853 --> 01:03:13.452
It makes her go crazy.

01:03:13.454 --> 01:03:15.023
Oh, my God. That's too much.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:18.691
That was so amazing.
Thank you.

01:04:02.304 --> 01:04:03.606
Ow.

01:04:03.972 --> 01:04:04.907
Okay.

01:04:27.862 --> 01:04:28.830
What?

01:04:29.731 --> 01:04:31.100
She's a better kisser.

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:35.570
- Oh, I didn't... I wasn't even ready.
- I'm just kidding.

01:05:25.286 --> 01:05:26.254
Are you okay?

01:05:27.021 --> 01:05:28.722
Yeah. Are you?

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:30.059
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

01:05:40.135 --> 01:05:41.967
I'm gonna use...
I'm gonna use the restroom.

01:05:41.969 --> 01:05:43.071
Mm-hmm.

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:50.947
Oh, God.

01:05:59.487 --> 01:06:00.623
Hey.

01:06:01.255 --> 01:06:02.123
Do you want water?

01:06:04.925 --> 01:06:05.894
Mm-mmm.

01:06:07.862 --> 01:06:08.964
Oh, yeah.

01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:10.967
Fuck. Let's do this.

01:06:24.646 --> 01:06:25.848
Oh, my God.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.751
Oh, my God.

01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:30.085
Oh, yes.

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:36.192
Oh, my God.

01:06:45.467 --> 01:06:46.735
Okay, I can't.

01:06:48.836 --> 01:06:50.103
What?

01:06:50.105 --> 01:06:52.871
I just...
I can't do this.

01:06:52.873 --> 01:06:54.206
It's fine.
We can take it slower.

01:06:54.208 --> 01:06:56.141
No, I don't think
we can go slower now.

01:06:56.143 --> 01:06:57.811
Wait, what's wrong?

01:06:57.813 --> 01:06:59.112
- Are you okay?
- It's... You just...

01:06:59.114 --> 01:07:01.914
You don't move like that
when I do that. You don't...

01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:05.788
wiggle like that, or make
those noises when I do that.

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:08.287
- Do what?
- When I...

01:07:08.289 --> 01:07:09.856
When you eat her out?

01:07:09.858 --> 01:07:11.825
Yes. Yeah, sure,
when I eat you out.

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:13.659
Yes, I do. You're great at it.

01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:14.829
I'm not that great.

01:07:15.262 --> 01:07:16.197
And then I was...

01:07:16.864 --> 01:07:19.532
I was kissing you, and...

01:07:19.534 --> 01:07:21.534
And you weren't even
kissing me back.

01:07:21.536 --> 01:07:23.202
And I just thought,
"You know what?

01:07:23.204 --> 01:07:25.671
"This is cool.
I'm gonna be the water boy."

01:07:25.673 --> 01:07:26.840
So I was gonna go
in the bathroom,

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:28.508
and I was gonna
fucking beat off,

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:29.742
and it was gonna be
a great time.

01:07:29.744 --> 01:07:31.543
And I couldn't do it,
Malory. Okay?

01:07:31.545 --> 01:07:32.945
Because I can't be
the water boy.

01:07:32.947 --> 01:07:35.115
Okay? I can't. I can't just
sit here and watch you.

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:38.184
Okay. We could just take it
slow, or just not do it at all.

01:07:38.186 --> 01:07:39.422
Like, we don't
have to do anything.

01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:42.155
Do you wanna be with her?

01:07:42.157 --> 01:07:44.257
- What?
- Do you wanna be with her?

01:07:44.259 --> 01:07:45.858
Are you more attracted
to her than me?

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.760
No, we're doing this together.

01:07:47.762 --> 01:07:49.829
No, this...
What's together about this?

01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:51.030
This isn't together.

01:07:51.032 --> 01:07:52.798
Yeah, 'cause you're standing up,
yelling at us.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.934
- What are you doing?
- Because I'm mad, Malory.

01:07:54.936 --> 01:07:57.604
Because I'm mad,
and I'm... And I'm...

01:07:57.606 --> 01:07:59.838
turned on,
and I'm confused, and...

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:03.112
It's fine. Sometimes
people feel left out.

01:08:05.313 --> 01:08:06.179
"Feel left out"?

01:08:06.181 --> 01:08:08.847
I just feel left out,
like kickball?

01:08:08.849 --> 01:08:10.182
I think you just
need to breathe.

01:08:10.184 --> 01:08:12.519
I am breathing.

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:14.787
That solves fucking everything.

01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:16.255
Doesn't that feel good?

01:08:16.256 --> 01:08:17.256
Just air.

01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:19.992
Solves all the fucking problems,
doesn't it?

01:08:19.993 --> 01:08:22.728
Okay, well, just calm down.
We're done.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:24.062
Sorry, April.

01:08:24.064 --> 01:08:26.201
- Cal, we wanted to do this together.
- Yeah.

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:29.968
You know, this is so you.

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:31.703
This is so not a surprise to me.

01:08:31.706 --> 01:08:33.473
You can't fucking handle it.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:35.974
You want shit in your life, and you
don't actually go for it when it comes.

01:08:35.975 --> 01:08:38.277
Roll with the moment
like it's happening. Do it.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.612
Like, we haven't even pulled the
fucking trigger on getting married.

01:08:40.613 --> 01:08:42.115
This is not about that.

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:44.683
So why are we doing this? What's
wrong with our relationship?

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:46.553
I don't know,
but this isn't... healthy.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:49.288
Oh, so you wanna be, like, a normal,
healthy couple like Katie and Charlie?

01:08:49.291 --> 01:08:51.558
"Oh, we're gonna
have a baby, we're so excited!

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.125
"We're gonna drive an SUV..."

01:08:53.127 --> 01:08:55.527
I just ran into Charlie
before this happened.

01:08:55.529 --> 01:08:57.964
- And?
- They're not... They're not doing that good.

01:08:57.966 --> 01:08:59.631
What the fuck do you want?

01:08:59.634 --> 01:09:01.667
We've been engaged
for four fucking years.

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:02.902
- That's so long.
- Oh, right. Right.

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:03.902
No one does that.

01:09:03.904 --> 01:09:05.437
Yeah, that's me. That's on me.

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:08.473
Well, then who is it on? You? Me?
Both of us? What are we doing?

01:09:08.475 --> 01:09:10.442
I don't know, okay?

01:09:13.346 --> 01:09:14.947
Great. Great.

01:09:14.948 --> 01:09:16.883
- What, did you order a fourth?
- Oh, God.

01:09:18.618 --> 01:09:19.751
Yeah, hold on.

01:09:19.752 --> 01:09:21.421
I think I'm gonna go.

01:09:22.023 --> 01:09:24.760
But you still owe me $150

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:26.493
for the massage.

01:09:30.532 --> 01:09:31.598
What?

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:32.831
- Mal?
- Oh, my God.

01:09:32.832 --> 01:09:34.399
What the hell?
I've been trying to reach you.

01:09:34.402 --> 01:09:35.268
Charlie is missing.

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:36.939
Charlie's fine.
He's at the pool.

01:09:39.106 --> 01:09:39.975
Who are you?

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:41.777
Hi.

01:09:45.546 --> 01:09:47.881
Um, I said it's $150.

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:50.282
Uh, yeah.

01:09:50.283 --> 01:09:51.416
Mal, is that a hooker?

01:09:51.417 --> 01:09:53.055
She's a massage therapist.

01:09:53.822 --> 01:09:55.056
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:09:58.592 --> 01:10:00.192
Mal.

01:10:00.194 --> 01:10:03.562
- Stop.
- Seriously. You pick tonight to have another threesome.

01:10:03.564 --> 01:10:05.000
- Katie.
- Another?

01:10:06.701 --> 01:10:08.170
I thought you'd never
done this before.

01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:11.803
What the fuck, Mal?

01:10:11.805 --> 01:10:14.473
This was supposed to be something that
we did together for the first time.

01:10:14.475 --> 01:10:15.974
Cal, I...

01:10:15.976 --> 01:10:17.910
- Shit.
- What else haven't you told me?

01:10:17.912 --> 01:10:19.114
You lied to me.

01:10:19.948 --> 01:10:21.380
I didn't lie to you,

01:10:21.382 --> 01:10:23.851
I just didn't tell you because
I knew you'd get jealous.

01:10:24.853 --> 01:10:26.989
I'm not jealous,
I'm just confused.

01:10:30.958 --> 01:10:32.224
It's been seven years, Mal.

01:10:32.226 --> 01:10:34.395
It should be easy.
We should know.

01:10:40.268 --> 01:10:41.403
And I don't know.

01:10:44.104 --> 01:10:45.540
Well, if you don't know, then...

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:48.109
don't you know?

01:11:07.028 --> 01:11:08.160
Where are you going?

01:11:08.162 --> 01:11:10.932
I don't know, okay?
I'll get... Charlie.

01:11:16.003 --> 01:11:18.106
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

01:11:38.426 --> 01:11:40.125
- Open the window.
- What?

01:11:40.127 --> 01:11:41.893
- What? Oh, he's got his own button.
- Open it.

01:11:41.895 --> 01:11:43.896
- Push it.
- Yeah, I got it.

01:11:43.898 --> 01:11:45.231
I could pull over.

01:11:45.233 --> 01:11:46.201
Oh, shit.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.102
- Oh.
- Oh, God.

01:11:49.104 --> 01:11:52.071
My eyes feel like lava.

01:11:52.073 --> 01:11:53.539
I can just hose that off.

01:11:53.541 --> 01:11:54.607
That'll come right off.

01:11:54.609 --> 01:11:56.008
Oh, I wanna vomit.

01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:58.311
You smell like you're sweating
wild turkey, honey.

01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:01.546
Yeah, I had
a bit of a long night.

01:12:01.548 --> 01:12:05.421
Well, get it together, because
it's gonna be a longer day.

01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:10.024
- Hey, there he is!
- How you doing?

01:12:11.326 --> 01:12:13.826
- Feeling better?
- Oh, yeah. Little bit.

01:12:13.828 --> 01:12:15.230
Shower was amazing.

01:12:18.733 --> 01:12:19.831
Want a drink?

01:12:19.833 --> 01:12:22.300
Oh, no. I'll probably
never drink again.

01:12:22.302 --> 01:12:24.771
What, a wild
Palm Springs evening, was it?

01:12:27.841 --> 01:12:29.243
Don't ask, don't tell.

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:31.246
You know...

01:12:32.346 --> 01:12:33.879
as I look as you two guys
sitting here,

01:12:33.881 --> 01:12:35.781
I just wanna say,
from the bottom of my heart,

01:12:35.783 --> 01:12:38.519
that I am so pleased and proud

01:12:39.386 --> 01:12:41.322
that you're both
a part of my family.

01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:43.592
Officially.

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:45.327
Thank you, sir.

01:12:47.595 --> 01:12:49.495
And unofficially.

01:12:49.497 --> 01:12:52.632
...the two of you
communicate, that's the key,

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:55.535
to be able to go through
every single thing as partners.

01:12:55.537 --> 01:12:58.504
You gotta be on the same page,
understand each other.

01:12:58.506 --> 01:12:59.772
Where's Cal, by the way?

01:12:59.774 --> 01:13:00.743
Oh, I don't know.

01:13:10.051 --> 01:13:12.250
It was like
a nuclear bomb went off.

01:13:12.252 --> 01:13:13.521
It just...

01:13:14.756 --> 01:13:15.758
Fusion.

01:13:16.824 --> 01:13:17.760
Fission.

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:19.759
Whatever.

01:13:19.761 --> 01:13:21.494
And those little girls,

01:13:21.496 --> 01:13:22.661
Katie and Mal, boy,

01:13:22.663 --> 01:13:24.565
you gotta know that those
girls are precious to me.

01:13:25.766 --> 01:13:27.135
They got into my heart.

01:13:28.302 --> 01:13:30.171
They grabbed onto me
and wouldn't let go.

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.238
I never said this
to any of your guys before,

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.574
but I can't have my own kids.

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:37.378
Don't have any fish in the sack.
You know what I mean?

01:13:38.779 --> 01:13:40.379
And I don't know
what happened last night, guys,

01:13:40.381 --> 01:13:42.084
I really don't need to know
what happened,

01:13:42.884 --> 01:13:44.317
but I want you both to know

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:47.723
that a man's ego is a powerful,
powerful piece of shit.

01:13:48.422 --> 01:13:50.822
It can destroy a lot of things.

01:13:50.824 --> 01:13:53.459
It is a major-league buzzkill.

01:13:53.461 --> 01:13:56.664
I want you to learn how to
accept, forgive, and move on.

01:13:58.131 --> 01:14:00.366
That's the key to happiness.

01:14:00.368 --> 01:14:01.767
<i>...amazing...</i>

01:14:01.769 --> 01:14:03.602
- Hello?
- No, no, no.

01:14:03.604 --> 01:14:05.137
- There you are.
- No.

01:14:05.139 --> 01:14:06.671
No, no, no.

01:14:06.673 --> 01:14:08.840
What do you mean, "No, no, no"?
Let me look at that face.

01:14:08.842 --> 01:14:10.242
- No, no, no.
- Come on.

01:14:10.244 --> 01:14:12.544
No, it's bad luck to see the
bride on the wedding day.

01:14:12.546 --> 01:14:15.915
- It is not bad luck, honey, come on.
- It is bad luck.

01:14:15.917 --> 01:14:17.782
Besides, Henry's
our good-luck charm.

01:14:17.784 --> 01:14:18.918
Where is Henry?

01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.086
I haven't seen him yet.

01:14:21.088 --> 01:14:23.889
- Well, is he out there setting stuff up?
- I don't know.

01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:26.728
- Fuck.
- What do you mean you don't know? Where's Henry?

01:14:37.838 --> 01:14:39.140
So what are we gonna do?

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:42.744
We're gonna pick up Henry.

01:14:43.845 --> 01:14:45.410
Yeah, I know. I...

01:14:45.412 --> 01:14:47.381
Just... What are "we" gonna do?

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:49.485
I don't know.

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:52.688
I can ride back with my sister.

01:14:57.859 --> 01:14:58.861
Fine.

01:15:18.412 --> 01:15:19.814
Hey, we're here for Henry.

01:15:23.016 --> 01:15:24.252
Did no one call you?

01:15:24.886 --> 01:15:26.488
What? No. No one called us.

01:15:27.755 --> 01:15:29.621
Darn.

01:15:29.623 --> 01:15:33.526
It's just that I'm not, uh,
properly trained for this.

01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:34.563
What happened?

01:15:35.529 --> 01:15:36.532
Um...

01:15:37.364 --> 01:15:39.300
Last night, Henry...

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:41.502
in his sleep, um...

01:15:45.172 --> 01:15:46.772
Chris, Alex.

01:15:46.774 --> 01:15:48.277
- Bastards!
- Oh!

01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:51.043
- He fucking died?
- Oh, no!

01:15:51.045 --> 01:15:52.611
- No, no!
- He's dead?

01:15:52.613 --> 01:15:55.513
No! How did he die?
What happened?

01:15:55.515 --> 01:15:56.451
He was old.

01:15:56.917 --> 01:15:58.049
They just go.

01:15:58.051 --> 01:15:59.151
Oh, my God.

01:15:59.153 --> 01:16:01.454
He went peacefully
in his sleep, though,

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:03.190
is what they said.

01:16:03.957 --> 01:16:05.326
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:16:06.127 --> 01:16:07.425
All right.

01:16:07.427 --> 01:16:09.363
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:16:09.963 --> 01:16:10.996
- Oh, my...
- Thank you.

01:16:10.998 --> 01:16:12.701
- Sorry. Sorry, again.
- Yeah.

01:16:14.135 --> 01:16:16.268
Hold, uh... Hold up.

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:17.836
Which Henry was yours?

01:16:17.838 --> 01:16:18.840
Addleberg.

01:16:20.641 --> 01:16:21.577
Oh.

01:16:22.644 --> 01:16:24.110
No.

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:25.177
That's... Okay.

01:16:25.179 --> 01:16:26.845
That's Henry Barnett.

01:16:26.847 --> 01:16:28.080
- What?
- Fuck, man!

01:16:28.082 --> 01:16:29.214
- What the fuck?
- Are you serious?

01:16:29.216 --> 01:16:31.250
Maybe you ask
that question first.

01:16:31.252 --> 01:16:32.451
You gotta be careful with that.

01:16:32.453 --> 01:16:34.019
- That's not good.
- I didn't...

01:16:34.021 --> 01:16:35.187
Sorry.

01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:36.522
- Yeah.
- I did not mean to...

01:16:36.524 --> 01:16:37.893
It's all right.
Where's our Henry?

01:16:38.592 --> 01:16:39.858
Room 318.

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.027
- 318. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:42.460
- Yeah. 318.
- Oh, uh...

01:16:42.462 --> 01:16:45.865
I'm sorry.
You can't just go up there.

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:47.199
Uh, what's your name?

01:16:47.201 --> 01:16:48.433
Malory Carter.

01:16:48.435 --> 01:16:50.237
We're in kind of a rush,
so if you could just...

01:16:50.904 --> 01:16:51.974
- Malory Carter?
- Yeah.

01:16:55.176 --> 01:16:56.675
It's "Karter" with a "K"?

01:16:56.677 --> 01:16:57.712
No, with a "C."

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:02.180
That's actually...
That's not gonna be possible,

01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:04.750
'cause your name's not on the
list of approved family contacts.

01:17:04.752 --> 01:17:06.718
Can't you just please
let us go up? It's...

01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.054
We're in such a hurry,
and it's so important.

01:17:09.056 --> 01:17:10.291
It's protocol.

01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:11.991
I'm sorry, guys.

01:17:11.993 --> 01:17:14.393
It's been a pretty rough night.

01:17:14.395 --> 01:17:17.129
And we would like to
just move on with our day.

01:17:17.131 --> 01:17:18.867
Please just help us out.

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.303
No, I can't do that.

01:17:24.305 --> 01:17:26.004
Come on, come on.

01:17:26.006 --> 01:17:27.639
Nobody's picking up.

01:17:27.641 --> 01:17:29.010
- They're doing wedding stuff.
- Fuck!

01:17:29.944 --> 01:17:30.979
Can I get a drag of that?

01:17:32.447 --> 01:17:34.315
I'm not leaving here
empty-handed.

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:36.715
Well... Thanks.

01:17:36.717 --> 01:17:38.217
He said no.

01:17:38.219 --> 01:17:39.884
So, what are you gonna do?

01:17:39.886 --> 01:17:41.687
Can your parents just
use their imagination?

01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:43.492
Can he marry them?
Do you wanna go?

01:17:44.559 --> 01:17:45.958
See?

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.925
Why does it fucking matter?

01:17:46.927 --> 01:17:48.126
It does. It fucking matters.

01:17:48.128 --> 01:17:50.662
'Cause it matters to my parents,
so it matters to me, okay?

01:17:50.664 --> 01:17:53.833
And fuck that guy in there, playing
games in his phone. He sucks.

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:54.900
Fuck!

01:17:54.902 --> 01:17:56.201
He can't win today.

01:17:56.203 --> 01:17:57.402
I need a win.

01:17:57.404 --> 01:17:59.571
Hi, excuse me.

01:17:59.573 --> 01:18:01.576
Is there a restroom I can use?
I have to pee.

01:18:02.609 --> 01:18:03.944
Yeah, there's one
right over there.

01:18:22.095 --> 01:18:22.997
Where are you going?

01:18:25.265 --> 01:18:27.299
Uh, is there a restroom
over here, by chance?

01:18:27.301 --> 01:18:30.706
There's just the restroom right here.
You can wait here, if you need to.

01:18:33.006 --> 01:18:34.041
Sorry, Gabe?

01:18:34.809 --> 01:18:36.442
Gabe. Sorry.

01:18:36.444 --> 01:18:40.745
I just wanna let you know it's really,
really gross in the bathroom. It's like...

01:18:40.747 --> 01:18:43.648
someone did a real paint job
in there. It's...

01:18:43.650 --> 01:18:44.983
It's always a mess 'cause the...

01:18:44.985 --> 01:18:47.389
'cause of all the laxatives
that everybody takes here.

01:18:48.823 --> 01:18:49.791
Can you clean it?

01:18:54.028 --> 01:18:55.227
Maintenance to lobby restroom.

01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:56.995
Oh, no. Can you clean it?
Like, just...

01:18:56.997 --> 01:19:00.199
I can't... I can't do it
'cause I can't leave the desk.

01:19:00.201 --> 01:19:01.400
Okay, I'll see you in the car.

01:19:01.402 --> 01:19:02.604
Cal, wait.

01:19:03.003 --> 01:19:03.939
Come on.

01:19:05.739 --> 01:19:06.608
Cal.

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.076
Okay.

01:19:10.578 --> 01:19:12.681
We're gonna bust Henry
out of this place.

01:19:13.346 --> 01:19:14.582
That's a cute shirt.

01:19:17.217 --> 01:19:20.753
This is what they give you.
It's... Everybody has them here.

01:19:20.755 --> 01:19:22.390
The color's, like, perfect.

01:19:23.123 --> 01:19:23.992
Do you have a girlfriend?

01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:29.831
No, not now.

01:19:30.463 --> 01:19:32.097
Do you want one?

01:19:32.099 --> 01:19:34.536
I have someone who probably
would like you a lot.

01:19:35.368 --> 01:19:37.773
If... Yeah, I would be...
I mean...

01:19:38.338 --> 01:19:39.608
I would be interested.

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:42.844
What color eyes do you have?

01:19:45.179 --> 01:19:46.477
Blue, right?

01:19:46.479 --> 01:19:48.546
Hey, man, is, uh,
that supposed to be happening?

01:19:49.984 --> 01:19:51.720
Aw, fuck! Fire!

01:19:52.252 --> 01:19:53.521
Damn it.

01:19:54.121 --> 01:19:55.653
Did you see who did it?

01:19:55.655 --> 01:19:56.888
There was a guy smoking there.

01:19:56.890 --> 01:19:58.824
- Did you get his hair, and...
- White hair.

01:19:58.826 --> 01:20:00.593
- White hair?
- Yeah. He went...

01:20:00.595 --> 01:20:02.628
Okay, search. We gotta...

01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:05.531
- Okay, go get him. And I'll meet you in the back.
- Okay.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.321
- Come on.
- You know I can walk, right?

01:20:37.331 --> 01:20:39.100
I'm here alone, man.
Come over here.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.770
Ah, this is the worst day!

01:20:53.948 --> 01:20:54.679
That was crazy!

01:20:54.681 --> 01:20:56.248
- Crazy!
- That was awesome!

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:58.118
That was fantastic!

01:20:58.685 --> 01:20:59.652
Whoo!

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.320
- I mean, Mal... No.
- You were so awesome.

01:21:01.322 --> 01:21:04.188
That was awesome. You saw a
window, and you went for it.

01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:06.025
- No, I mean, it was your...
- How did you even find him?

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.860
I just feel like
we need to kidnap more people.

01:21:07.862 --> 01:21:09.628
- We just have to kidnap more people.
- Anytime.

01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:10.931
- That was so cool.
- Anytime.

01:21:12.065 --> 01:21:13.467
We didn't need the flares.

01:21:14.467 --> 01:21:16.101
- But...
- I liked the flares.

01:21:16.103 --> 01:21:17.736
- I liked them. I liked the flares.
- I liked the flares.

01:21:17.738 --> 01:21:19.271
I thought that was a good touch.

01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.088
Hey, hey, you guys.
One minute. One second.

01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:37.389
I wanna read...

01:21:37.391 --> 01:21:40.159
I wanna read the speech I'm
gonna do at the ceremony later.

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:41.026
Practice, okay?

01:21:41.028 --> 01:21:42.827
I gotta help them
set up the chairs.

01:21:42.829 --> 01:21:45.397
Hey, Cal, hold on, hold on.
I need two people.

01:21:45.399 --> 01:21:47.700
- Stay. It'll take a minute.
- Okay.

01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:49.237
Okay. So, here we go.

01:21:49.837 --> 01:21:50.936
"Marriage.

01:21:50.938 --> 01:21:54.072
"It's foolish, idiotic,
insane, even,

01:21:54.074 --> 01:21:56.942
"to believe there is
one person out there

01:21:56.944 --> 01:22:00.478
"that we could ever
possibly hope to track down,

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.449
"and live a perfectly happy
existence with."

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:04.849
That's a little harsh.

01:22:04.851 --> 01:22:07.085
Uh, hold on. Hang in there.

01:22:07.087 --> 01:22:12.357
"Yet these two stand here before us
and say, 'We commit to this insanity.'

01:22:12.359 --> 01:22:15.626
"These two have said, 'Rational
thought is against us.

01:22:15.628 --> 01:22:17.763
"'Divorce rates are against us.

01:22:17.765 --> 01:22:20.165
"'You and I
are both deeply flawed.

01:22:20.167 --> 01:22:26.237
"'But we will continue to challenge all
the forces that jeopardize our union.'

01:22:26.239 --> 01:22:30.174
"Like sailors on the open sea,
they have been through it all.

01:22:30.176 --> 01:22:35.781
"And still, they stand together
to weather the next storm.

01:22:35.783 --> 01:22:38.349
"And the next one after that.

01:22:38.351 --> 01:22:44.623
"So, today, we celebrate the foolishness,
recklessness, and complete lack of rationale

01:22:44.625 --> 01:22:48.893
"that has gone into making
this couple so strong.

01:22:48.895 --> 01:22:53.969
"Today we celebrate love and all
of its beautiful imperfections.

01:22:54.935 --> 01:22:58.306
"And of course,
with the exchange of rings."

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:02.077
Oh, wait.

01:23:03.243 --> 01:23:04.375
We got this.

01:23:04.377 --> 01:23:05.646
What about you?

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:14.588
What is that?

01:23:15.021 --> 01:23:15.990
It's, um,

01:23:16.556 --> 01:23:17.791
from the smoke grenade.

01:23:18.125 --> 01:23:19.027
Okay.

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:20.729
Perfect.

01:23:23.096 --> 01:23:25.563
So, uh, Cal.

01:23:25.565 --> 01:23:28.834
Do you take Mal
to be your lady love

01:23:28.836 --> 01:23:31.606
forever and ever-ish
kind of thing?

01:23:34.274 --> 01:23:35.143
I do.

01:23:35.509 --> 01:23:36.677
All right.

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:41.216
This ring is gross.

01:23:42.182 --> 01:23:44.183
And, Mal.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:49.090
Do you take Cal here to be your
dude for everlasting-ness-ness?

01:23:52.059 --> 01:23:53.094
I do.

01:23:54.528 --> 01:23:55.861
It's a little big.

01:23:55.863 --> 01:23:58.900
It's a little... Yeah.
But I can just get it resized.

01:23:59.533 --> 01:24:00.702
And inscribed.

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:03.102
Well, okay.

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:06.772
"And so today, by the power vested
in me by the State of California,

01:24:06.774 --> 01:24:08.943
"I now pronounce you
man and wife."

01:24:10.243 --> 01:24:12.212
Now kiss, you maniacs.

01:24:13.913 --> 01:24:17.583
Or not. I don't really care.
You know what I mean, you know.

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.953
You don't have to kiss.
I mean, that's...

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.440
You are a much better kisser
than me.

01:24:39.239 --> 01:24:40.307
I know.

01:24:44.645 --> 01:24:45.710
I'm sorry.

01:24:45.712 --> 01:24:46.947
I'm sorry, too.

01:24:50.751 --> 01:24:53.121
So, did Henry secretly marry us?

01:24:54.121 --> 01:24:55.289
I think so.

01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:57.723
- He's good.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:58.656
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:58.658 --> 01:24:59.860
He's, like, too good.

01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.130
Do you feel different?

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:04.833
I feel good.

01:25:05.698 --> 01:25:07.999
- Good.
- I feel really good.

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:09.304
I don't feel different.

01:25:09.603 --> 01:25:10.771
Should I?

01:25:12.206 --> 01:25:13.539
No.

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:17.875
It's probably because we're not
technically married, like...

01:25:17.877 --> 01:25:20.012
We're only married in the
eyes of Henry and the Lord.

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:22.446
- Right. We need a marriage license.
- Yes.

01:25:22.448 --> 01:25:25.052
Of course. We can just
pick up the license tomorrow.

01:25:25.418 --> 01:25:26.485
Yeah.

01:25:26.487 --> 01:25:28.922
- Oh, they'll be closed on Sunday.
- Oh, right.

01:25:29.622 --> 01:25:31.123
Monday?

01:25:31.125 --> 01:25:33.759
Monday's a little tough for me.
I think Tuesday would be better.

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:35.660
I just can't do Tuesday.
I think I'll be working.

01:25:35.662 --> 01:25:37.461
Okay. Wednesday?

01:25:37.463 --> 01:25:39.430
- I can try for Wednesday.
- I can't.

01:25:39.432 --> 01:25:40.464
- You can't do Wednesday?
- No.

01:25:40.466 --> 01:25:41.833
- Oh, okay.
- At all, actually.

01:25:41.835 --> 01:25:43.501
- Oh.
- Wow, I can't even believe I suggested it.

01:25:43.503 --> 01:25:44.404
No, it's a bad day.

01:25:46.105 --> 01:25:47.272
I love you.

01:25:47.274 --> 01:25:48.209
I love you, too.

01:26:39.359 --> 01:26:40.460
What time is it?

01:26:41.561 --> 01:26:44.196
Fucking bugs on my...

01:26:44.198 --> 01:26:46.565
It's the biggest bug
I've ever seen.

01:26:46.567 --> 01:26:49.433
Oh, my God.

01:26:49.435 --> 01:26:51.905
Like a Slip'N Slide, just...

01:26:53.039 --> 01:26:55.042
fly right in.

01:26:55.943 --> 01:26:57.445
But before that
we have candles.

01:26:58.378 --> 01:26:59.544
Oh, yes.

01:27:01.681 --> 01:27:03.348
Okay.

01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:05.616
Coloring outside the lines,
all right.

01:27:05.618 --> 01:27:06.918
I'm down with that. Surf's up.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.452
- Like we're kids again.
- Yeah.

01:27:08.454 --> 01:27:10.222
- Just...
- Kids who fuck.

01:27:10.224 --> 01:27:11.159
Kids who fuck.

01:27:12.458 --> 01:27:13.360
I like that.

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:15.559
You guys are pretty cool.

01:27:16.930 --> 01:27:18.696
- Sriracharita?
- No.

01:27:18.698 --> 01:27:19.930
Actually, I was just
in the restroom,

01:27:19.932 --> 01:27:22.166
and someone did
a real paint job in there.

01:27:22.168 --> 01:27:23.902
There's, like, doo-doo, feces...

01:27:25.238 --> 01:27:27.406
There's, like,
doo-doo, feces everywhere...

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:29.674
I can't do it. I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.

01:27:29.676 --> 01:27:32.546
There's, like, doo-doo, feces
everywhere. It's disgusting.

01:27:33.113 --> 01:27:34.879
Shit. Animals.

01:27:37.818 --> 01:27:38.983
- I did it.
- Yeah.

01:27:40.354 --> 01:27:42.754
I cannot believe
I'm going out tonight.

01:27:42.756 --> 01:27:46.191
Like, I'm up to my ass in
paperwork, you have no idea.

01:27:46.193 --> 01:27:48.492
I've got a deposition next week.

01:27:48.494 --> 01:27:50.594
Why did I go to law school?

01:27:50.596 --> 01:27:54.132
I could've just been a fucking
Instagram model, you know?

01:27:54.134 --> 01:27:55.936
They don't come here
to be made fun of.

01:27:57.404 --> 01:28:00.375
So it that's what you plan at
doing, I suggest you leave.

01:28:04.043 --> 01:28:06.344
Steam coming out of your ears.

01:28:06.346 --> 01:28:07.948
Do you mean
like a prostitute?

01:28:08.716 --> 01:28:10.151
No, not a 'tute.

01:28:10.751 --> 01:28:11.953
Like...

01:28:13.186 --> 01:28:14.553
You mean like a prostitute?

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:16.021
No, not a 'tute.

01:28:16.023 --> 01:28:18.589
Oh, my God.

01:28:18.591 --> 01:28:21.028
Uh, like a prostitute?

01:28:21.694 --> 01:28:23.527
No, not a 'tute.

01:28:23.529 --> 01:28:27.668
Top-notch escort. Upper-echelon female...

01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:32.670
I did three months
at Esselen, guys.

01:28:32.672 --> 01:28:35.072
And the one thing they
taught me to do was breathe.

01:28:35.074 --> 01:28:36.241
So let's breathe.

01:28:38.545 --> 01:28:40.312
Let it out.

01:28:42.282 --> 01:28:45.153
And hope that person that's going
to the hospital is gonna survive.

01:28:45.752 --> 01:28:47.218
But I'm wondering,

01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:50.187
I've only been with 39 men
in my entire life.

01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:52.691
- Mom.
- Oh, that's kind of a lot.

01:28:52.693 --> 01:28:55.393
Oh, Leanne... Leanne Carlson.

01:28:55.395 --> 01:28:57.361
Why would you say
"Oh" to that?

01:28:58.465 --> 01:29:00.034
- Sorry... I'm sorry.
- You know her?

01:29:00.634 --> 01:29:02.334
No, you...

01:29:02.336 --> 01:29:04.302
Okay, you're not on the
approved family contact list,

01:29:04.304 --> 01:29:07.339
and that's actually
one of the main lists

01:29:07.341 --> 01:29:09.377
that are...
