00:01.419 --> 00:02.534
- Previously on "Killjoys"...

00:02.837 --> 00:03.326
- What's inside?

00:03.629 --> 00:05.585
- This one Khlyen
made me was a safe house,

00:05.590 --> 00:08.332
but the first one he made
was a prison for Aneela.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.424
- So one keeps Aneela out,
the other locks her in.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.501
- Meet Lucian Kitaan.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.846
She's Hullen...
a hive-minded sociopath.

00:15.850 --> 00:18.387
- The combined memories
of every Six get stored here.

00:18.394 --> 00:19.850
D'Avin can connect to the green
and flip through his memories

00:19.854 --> 00:20.809
like a radio dial.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.858
- Label this Jaqobis One.

00:24.859 --> 00:27.566
- Looks like it's time
to get to work, Brynn.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.686
- Gander used my research.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.688
It was only
supposed to be a theory,

00:31.699 --> 00:33.405
but it worked.

00:33.409 --> 00:35.400
- Commander
Alfred Olyevich Turin,

00:35.411 --> 00:38.824
you're under arrest for sedition
and crimes against your people.

00:38.831 --> 00:41.413
- You do this to take away
other people's sins.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.078
Does it work on yours?

00:43.085 --> 00:45.747
- I need you
to do something for me.

00:45.755 --> 00:47.541
You're not gonna like it.

00:52.512 --> 00:53.547
- You found them.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.090
- Wasn't exactly hard.

00:55.097 --> 00:59.431
Scarbacks and knives,
it's kind of your thing.

00:59.435 --> 01:01.391
- These aren't just any knives.

01:01.395 --> 01:05.764
Have you heard
of Reckoning Night?

01:05.775 --> 01:09.484
The Thirteen Who Went to Arkyn?

01:09.487 --> 01:13.446
- What happened on Arkyn?

01:13.449 --> 01:15.531
- A long time ago,

01:15.535 --> 01:17.400
the Devil came to the Quad.

01:19.789 --> 01:21.529
Like a virus,

01:21.541 --> 01:24.704
she hid in our bodies,
our blood.

01:24.710 --> 01:28.419
The only way to reveal
who had been defiled

01:28.422 --> 01:30.708
was with the cut of a blade.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.583
That's why
the Scarbacks were born...

01:33.594 --> 01:37.337
To show who was pure
and who had the Devil inside.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.595
One night, 13 monks

01:41.602 --> 01:43.467
looked to the barren moon
of Arkyn,

01:43.479 --> 01:46.596
where they met
the Devil face-to-face...

01:46.607 --> 01:49.474
and swore to kill her.

01:49.485 --> 01:50.986
— Did they?

01:50.987 --> 01:53.478
- No.

01:53.489 --> 01:54.774
No, they did not.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.740
The night before
they left for Arkyn,

01:57.743 --> 01:59.483
knowing they might never return,

01:59.495 --> 02:01.451
each monk went
to someone they loved,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.537
or hated,

02:03.541 --> 02:05.827
someone they
needed to reckon with.

02:05.835 --> 02:08.872
So now, before a battle,

02:08.879 --> 02:10.961
we give a confession
or a curse...

02:10.965 --> 02:13.206
One last thing to say
before the end.

02:13.217 --> 02:17.551
- How do you know it's the end?

02:17.555 --> 02:20.547
I don't.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.674
But I do know it's coming.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.515
- Okay, let me show you.

02:30.526 --> 02:31.936
This plasma is
from a single pool.

02:31.944 --> 02:33.684
Original source.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.983
Secondary source.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.822
- I know how this works, Dutch.

02:38.826 --> 02:43.616
- You kill
the original source...

02:43.623 --> 02:47.536
and the secondary one dies, too.

02:47.543 --> 02:50.535
Aneela was my original source.
She made me from her memories.

02:50.546 --> 02:53.003
So, when she dies, I die.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.793
- | get all that.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.665
I don't get why
you think the only way

02:56.677 --> 02:58.838
to stop her is to kill her.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.632
Maybe there's another way.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.632
- D'Av, she's a psychotic bitch
with daddy issues.

03:03.643 --> 03:06.760
Trust me, I know the type.
There's no other way.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.762
- I want to hear
what Johnny has to say.

03:08.773 --> 03:10.513
He'll have ideas.
- No.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.061
No matter what happens,
you do not tell Johnny.

03:13.069 --> 03:15.560
- Why?
- You're his brother.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.653
You know he won't
be able to handle this.

03:17.657 --> 03:19.648
- An enemy ship
is approaching The Rack.

03:21.619 --> 03:24.076
-An unknown Black Root ship
just docked.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.991
- How the hells did it
blow past our auto cannons?

03:25.998 --> 03:27.704
-As soon as we picked it up,

03:27.708 --> 03:29.539
the entire defense grid
went offline.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.283
And before you ask
the next obvious question,

03:31.295 --> 03:32.956
no, we cannot see inside...
It's blocking our scanners.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.547
Anybody order delivery?

03:39.053 --> 03:40.884
- Let's not go
total bullet festival

03:40.888 --> 03:42.549
till I get a look
at this beauty.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.723
- Well, don't kill anyone
on my account.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.767
Oh, I do hate to be a bother.

03:52.775 --> 03:53.981
- You're...
- Alive?

03:53.984 --> 03:56.316
Pregnant? Ravishing?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.276
Yes, all true.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.271
But I'm sure
you have lots of questions.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.694
Fire away, so to speak.

04:02.702 --> 04:04.863
- What the shit
are you doing here?

04:04.870 --> 04:07.282
- As emissary
for Commander Aneela Kin Rit,

04:07.289 --> 04:09.075
l, Delle Seyah Kendry
of House Kendry,

04:09.083 --> 04:12.041
invoke your
hospitality and protection

04:12.044 --> 04:14.626
to engage in Parley.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.916
- Parley?
In this century?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.630
- You can't be serious.

04:18.634 --> 04:19.919
- Oh, I'm very serious.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.963
But I do have
one demand, though.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.755
I'll only do it
with Johnny Jaqobis...

04:25.766 --> 04:27.051
alone.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.601
I killed you once before.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.106
What makes you think
that I won't do it again?

04:33.107 --> 04:35.098
- I'm sure you want to.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.100
But you won't...

04:37.111 --> 04:39.944
not when I'm carrying
your own brother's baby.

04:42.074 --> 04:44.941
- What did you do?

04:48.122 --> 04:50.784
- J‘ Ooh, ooh

04:50.791 --> 04:51.997
J“ Ooh, ooh

04:53.335 --> 04:55.997
J“ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh J‘

04:57.089 --> 04:58.920
J“ Ooh, ooh.

05:01.677 --> 05:03.838
- Hullen can't have babies.
- Easy.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.007
- This is bullshit.
- D'Av.

05:06.015 --> 05:07.846
- Trust me, I think
I would have remembered

05:07.850 --> 05:09.715
knocking up the most evil
woman in the universe.

05:09.727 --> 05:11.012
- I wouldn't believe Delle Seyah

05:11.020 --> 05:12.760
if she told me
my name was Dutch,

05:12.772 --> 05:13.761
starting with
this Parley nonsense.

05:13.773 --> 05:15.058
- That part's real.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.726
It's some serious
ancient-world shit.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.315
Before war,
an emissary from either side

05:18.319 --> 05:19.980
could meet and give
their final demands.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.399
- Can I bother one of you
for a snack?

05:22.406 --> 05:24.783
I am eating for two these days.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.366
- Okay, now she's
just messing with me.

05:28.370 --> 05:30.406
- There's no way
she wants peace.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.745
But she took a big risk
coming here.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.410
Why?
- Parley rules.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.373
Neither side can harm or hinder
the other while they talk.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.708
She probably thinks she's safe.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.623
- Well, let her think that.

05:38.631 --> 05:40.747
Look, we need to know
when the Armada's on their way,

05:40.758 --> 05:42.123
what she's planning.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.749
Johnny, you need to
keep her talking.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.672
- Keep her talking?
After what she did?

05:45.679 --> 05:46.885
Do you know
what you're asking me?

05:46.889 --> 05:48.800
- What we're asking for is time.

05:48.808 --> 05:50.799
Trust me.
We need it.

05:52.812 --> 05:54.928
- I'll see you on the
battlefield. Excuse me, boys.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.895
l was hoping to run into you.
- Same.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.015
We're gonna need every
able-bodied Scarback we can get.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.857
— They'll be ready.
What about you?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.067
- I'm always ready.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.902
- For Reckoning Night?

06:03.906 --> 06:05.817
- I appreciate
the sentiment, Alvis,

06:05.825 --> 06:07.440
but I don't have time for
hookups and magic knives.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.942
I've got a Quad to save.
- The knives aren't magic.

06:09.954 --> 06:11.740
But they are useful.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.954
No one knows if we're
ever coming back from this.

06:13.958 --> 06:18.042
- Some of us do.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.957
But I'll take it
to spare sad monk face.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.417
- So what do you want?

06:26.428 --> 06:28.680
- Ah, ah, ah.

06:28.681 --> 06:30.046
The words.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.845
We have to
do this right, Jaqobis.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.437
"Into this circle,
I, John Jaqobis,

06:39.441 --> 06:43.104
"do welcome you,
Delle Seyah Kendry.

06:43.112 --> 06:45.728
"No man or woman shall harm you,
but they harm me,

06:45.739 --> 06:46.945
until Parley breaks."

06:46.949 --> 06:48.905
- "Until Parley breaks," yes.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.070
I knew you'd come through.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.739
- You don't know me,
Delle Seyah.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.486
But you took
a big risk coming here.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.079
- Not that big.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.039
If I'm not returned unharmed
within 12 hours,

06:58.043 --> 07:01.080
15,000 skyfire missiles
will turn Westerley into dust.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.079
And I know you well enough
to be sure

07:03.090 --> 07:07.459
that you don't want that on
your adorable little conscience.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.846
I'm here to talk.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.383
- So talk.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.505
What do you want?

07:12.516 --> 07:14.052
- Simple.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.139
Give us Dutch.

07:17.062 --> 07:19.849
- That's it?
And then, uh... then you go home?

07:19.857 --> 07:21.518
- Oh, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

07:21.525 --> 07:23.140
No, we're still taking the Quad.

07:23.152 --> 07:25.768
We'd just like to do it
without all the fighting

07:25.779 --> 07:27.235
and resisting and whatnot.

07:27.239 --> 07:31.073
- So... total surrender?
Is there anything else?

07:31.076 --> 07:33.112
- Oh, you don't seem to be
taking this very seriously.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.951
- Oh, but I've got my

07:34.955 --> 07:36.866
"totally taking this seriously"
face on and everything.

07:36.874 --> 07:38.205
- Oh.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.995
Oh. Ha ha.

07:41.003 --> 07:43.119
Oh, that's a new one.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.247
I'm trying to help you, Jaqobis.
- Don't bother.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.089
The Quad will never accept
any of this without a fight.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.958
- Forget the Quad.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.961
I'm talking about something
far more personal.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.553
Make the accord,

07:56.560 --> 07:58.141
and I will spare you

07:58.145 --> 08:00.557
and your brother.

08:00.564 --> 08:05.024
- Expand search perimeter 25%.
All ranges open.

08:05.027 --> 08:08.064
Where are you, Aneela?

08:08.072 --> 08:09.482
We searched the entire Quad...

08:09.490 --> 08:11.151
No energy spikes,
no heat signals.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.568
If the Armada's here,
we can't see it.

08:12.576 --> 08:13.952
- We need to
go somewhere and talk.

08:13.953 --> 08:15.443
Zeph and l have an idea.

08:15.454 --> 08:17.194
- Talk here.
I'm waiting for another scan.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.157
- Everybody out!

08:21.168 --> 08:22.533
Now!

08:22.544 --> 08:25.035
General's orders!

08:25.047 --> 08:26.287
Not you, Zeph.

08:26.298 --> 08:27.913
- D'Av...

08:27.925 --> 08:29.540
is this about Delle Seyah?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.587
Because nobody believes
that baby shit.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.096
- I don't care about that.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.053
Actually, I'm...
pretty freaked out,

08:35.057 --> 08:36.513
but that's not
what this is about.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.929
Zeph, talk.
- I'm really not getting

08:38.936 --> 08:40.176
the "Dutch wants
to hear Zeph talk" vibe.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.973
- Zeph.
- Okay.

08:41.981 --> 08:43.596
Um, if the Armada's
as close as we think,

08:43.607 --> 08:45.598
there's no way I can get
the Sonic ready in time

08:45.609 --> 08:47.895
to mind-bang their ships
like we planned,

08:47.903 --> 08:50.485
but maybe we can use this.

08:50.489 --> 08:52.275
- Khlyen's cube.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.318
What, do we all hide in it
until the Armada flies away?

08:54.326 --> 08:55.862
- Not us, her.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.575
We don't need to kill Aneela.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.535
We just need to get her inside
and keep her there,

08:59.540 --> 09:01.201
like Khlyen did.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.994
You've been in her memories.
You know what she wants.

09:03.002 --> 09:04.082
What would she come for?

09:04.086 --> 09:05.121
- Well, we know that

09:05.129 --> 09:06.164
she wants to kill me.

09:08.966 --> 09:11.628
- What if she thinks
you're in the cube?

09:11.635 --> 09:13.250
The Hullen share memories.

09:13.262 --> 09:15.548
What if we could find a way
to implant a memory

09:15.556 --> 09:17.968
into the green that makes her
think you're there?

09:17.975 --> 09:19.931
She would go to it.

09:19.935 --> 09:20.970
- D'Av.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.344
- This could work, Dutch.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.936
This could save you.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.105
All right.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.602
And I think I know
someone who can help

09:31.613 --> 09:34.195
with that memory swap.
- Me too.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.655
- I am telling you
right now, my family

09:35.659 --> 09:38.036
is not gonna pay any ransom.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.528
You!

09:41.540 --> 09:43.906
Wow, with... with the
black hood and everything!

09:43.917 --> 09:46.203
- Yeah, for old times' sake.
- Well, I am touched.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.042
But no wonder
I didn't recognize you.

09:48.047 --> 09:49.662
Where were all the threats
to punch me in the face?

09:49.673 --> 09:51.379
- Look, we need some help
with some underground shit.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.169
We have to find a way
to take a memory from one person

09:53.177 --> 09:55.008
and put it into someone else.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.923
And we can't ask John.
Want to help source some tech?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.261
- Sounds interesting...

09:58.265 --> 09:59.630
and creepy.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.302
- Which is why I thought of you.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.221
- Are there ladies involved?

10:03.228 --> 10:04.968
- Kind of.

10:04.980 --> 10:08.222
Trust me, Pip,
this one isn't your type.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.610
- Make 'em nice and tight,
flesh bag.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.476
I like a good challenge.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.152
Mmm, you give back rubs

10:18.160 --> 10:19.991
to all the girls
you spring from the brig?

10:19.995 --> 10:21.576
- I'm not springing you.
It's a day trip.

10:21.580 --> 10:24.196
And this is definitely
not a back rub.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.573
It's insurance.

10:27.086 --> 10:28.292
- I will tear your eyes out

10:28.295 --> 10:29.956
and feed them to you,
meat stick.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.954
- You'll heal, eventually.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.705
So long as my knife is between
your second and third vertebrae,

10:33.717 --> 10:35.582
you won't be able
to scratch your own ass.

10:35.594 --> 10:39.052
So play nice
and do exactly as I say.

10:39.056 --> 10:41.012
- Clever girl.

10:41.016 --> 10:43.098
I'll give you this.

10:43.102 --> 10:45.263
You're definitely
as crazy as her.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.435
- I didn't say you could talk.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.206
- Fancy...

11:15.217 --> 11:16.673
do you know what tonight is?

11:18.220 --> 11:20.336
Do I look like
the religious type?

11:20.347 --> 11:22.463
- I've been thinking about you.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.011
Being taken by the Hullen.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.145
Couldn't have been easy...

11:27.146 --> 11:29.102
being cut off
from everyone you knew.

11:29.106 --> 11:32.439
- You ever buy
your own bullshit, monk?

11:32.442 --> 11:34.182
- Funny you should ask.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.236
Fancy Lee...

11:45.247 --> 11:47.283
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.997
- For what?

11:49.001 --> 11:52.084
- For not being there
when you needed it...

11:52.087 --> 11:55.500
and not seeing that until now.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.247
- Your knife.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.671
- It's yours now.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.009
- Uh, Pip,
I appreciate your help,

12:08.020 --> 12:09.305
but in the future,
give me a heads-up

12:09.313 --> 12:11.804
if our destination
is a VR circle jerk.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.101
- You said
you wanted underground, okay?

12:14.109 --> 12:16.976
This is as underground
as it gets.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.524
Also, technically,
it's a "circle jack."

12:19.531 --> 12:22.364
Also, I wouldn't touch anything.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.447
Oh, Mano!

12:27.122 --> 12:29.158
Mano!

12:29.166 --> 12:31.122
- Hey, hey. We're trying to keep
this on the down low, remember?

12:31.126 --> 12:33.538
- D'Av, D'Avinski,
what's my middle name, baby?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.331
Annoying.

12:35.339 --> 12:37.045
- Good timing, Pip-man.

12:37.049 --> 12:38.414
New batch just came in.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.167
"Shower Day in
a Terlian Salt Mine."

12:41.178 --> 12:43.419
- Ha. Okay.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.091
What a perv this guy is, huh?

12:45.098 --> 12:46.804
- You're gonna love it.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.550
Hey, you want your usual
"Mommy Domineer-ist"...

12:49.561 --> 12:52.268
- Okay. Hey.
Anyway, uh... Hush.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.433
l-l sent you a message.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.432
About the false memory stuff?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.478
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.241
- Yeah, like you aren't
into some weird shit, too.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.322
Okay, don'tjudge me.

13:06.578 --> 13:09.320
- But it's like I said...

13:09.331 --> 13:11.447
This shit ain't
just heavy, okay?

13:11.458 --> 13:14.575
This is, uh, beyond virtual.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.451
You jack something in with this,

13:16.463 --> 13:18.374
pleasure, pain,

13:18.382 --> 13:19.588
you think it happened.

13:19.591 --> 13:22.583
You think it happened.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.459
For realsies.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.462
- Good.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.589
Because if it doesn't work,

13:28.600 --> 13:31.307
I will come back
and show you pain.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.471
For realsies.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.845
- God, that's hot.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.312
- You know I'm not
about to sell out

13:36.316 --> 13:37.601
every single person in the Quad

13:37.609 --> 13:39.440
just so that I can be safe.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.857
- Fight us, and there won't
be many living left.

13:42.864 --> 13:46.197
I'm trying to help you all.
Trust me.

13:46.201 --> 13:48.362
- The last time that I did that,
you killed someone that I loved.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.361
Pawter, still?

13:50.372 --> 13:52.454
You really have to
let that one go.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.493
I mean, uh, you killed me.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.911
Am I carrying a grudge?

13:55.919 --> 13:58.080
Besides...

13:58.088 --> 14:00.374
we're family now.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.213
- We know the Hullen
can't get pregnant.

14:02.217 --> 14:03.502
- Well, don't
take my word for it.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.501
I wouldn't.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.218
Test me.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.338
DNA samples, whatever you want.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.010
| submit to you completely.

14:14.104 --> 14:17.312
- Thanks.
I got a war to get ready for.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.181
- Please.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.320
- You want me to scan you?

14:25.324 --> 14:28.111
-Agreeing to Parley
was the only way

14:28.118 --> 14:31.235
I could convince Aneela
to let me off the Armada.

14:34.583 --> 14:38.167
I need to know
what's really inside me.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.582
- No, Dutch, it's too dangerous.

14:40.589 --> 14:42.545
I cannot let you go.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.255
- I need to do this, D'Avin.

14:44.259 --> 14:48.127
l have to go
into the cube, alone.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.595
It's the only place
I'll be safe.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.931
Aneela will never
think to find me there.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.549
- Damn it.
You're right.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.597
But I still don't like it.
- Stop.

14:56.605 --> 14:59.142
No. Just stop.
What?

14:59.149 --> 15:01.936
You guys literally
just pissed in my eyeballs

15:01.943 --> 15:03.149
with that performance.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.438
D'Avin, what is this?

15:04.446 --> 15:06.357
What are you doing
with your hands?

15:06.365 --> 15:07.696
When have you ever seen
a human being do that? Okay?

15:07.699 --> 15:09.439
You lie to people
for a living, right?

15:09.451 --> 15:11.282
- It's different
when you're being recorded.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.571
- What am I supposed to do
with these?

15:12.579 --> 15:15.286
Here.

15:15.290 --> 15:18.908
Try this.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.626
- Now I don't know
what to do with the cup.

15:21.630 --> 15:24.292
- Just improvise, all right?

15:24.299 --> 15:27.462
Be honest, except
for the whole lying part.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.584
All right, it's gonna be great.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.176
It's gonna be really good.

15:30.180 --> 15:31.511
From the top.

15:31.515 --> 15:34.973
And... act.

15:34.976 --> 15:37.262
- No, Dutch, it's too dangerous.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.932
I cannot let you go.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.307
- I know it's risky.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.684
And I know you
don't want to do this.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.481
As long as I'm in the cube,

15:47.489 --> 15:49.025
Aneela can't find me.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.238
I'll be safe.

15:50.242 --> 15:52.324
This could work, D'Av.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.737
This could save me.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.620
- Aw.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.956
How'd you know
it was my birthday?

15:59.960 --> 16:02.326
And you got me my very own
little boy to chew on.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.998
What does that mean?

16:04.005 --> 16:05.745
- Come a little closer,
I'll show you.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.583
- Behave.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.459
We've got tests to run.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.962
— You ran all sorts
on me in the brig.

16:15.559 --> 16:18.471
You keep sticking me
with things.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.560
Starting to think you're...

16:20.564 --> 16:22.475
sweet on me.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.604
- Okay.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.648
It's showtime.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.772
- No, Dutch, it's too dangerous.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.523
I cannot let you go.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.321
My voice does not
sound like that.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.613
- I know it's risky...
- Does it?

16:38.665 --> 16:40.371
- I know you don't want...

16:40.375 --> 16:42.036
What's wrong?
What did you just do?

16:42.043 --> 16:44.420
- I don't know. The tech
is super prototype-y. Hang on.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.419
Aw.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.546
Were you trying to noodle
with my noggin?

16:58.685 --> 17:00.300
Here we go.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.559
- Whatever it is,
it's definitely organic.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.683
- What kind of organic, girl?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.309
- Well, it's hard to say.

17:09.321 --> 17:11.687
That can be a hand or a foot...

17:11.698 --> 17:13.359
or a claw.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.524
Whoa, your heart rate
just spiked.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.618
- Well, I wonder why that is!
- Easy.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.578
Easy.

17:20.582 --> 17:21.742
- Okay, there.
Stop.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.661
There.

17:23.668 --> 17:27.581
And it's a perfectly
normal-looking baby.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.626
- How? Hullen parasites
would attack the fetus.

17:30.634 --> 17:34.377
- I don't know, but I'd say
five, maybe six months.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.672
Try three weeks.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.548
- That's concerning.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.050
— Oh.
- Moment of truth.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.346
Paternity results.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.775
There's Daddy.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.613
How do you think | feel?

17:55.617 --> 17:58.404
I'm carrying the nephew
of my own killer.

17:58.411 --> 18:00.072
Oh! Something's wrong.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.446
- What the hells is that?

18:02.457 --> 18:05.745
- Oh! Oh, it hurts!
Something is wrong.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.617
- Just... just breathe.
We're trying... Zeph, come on.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.415
- I don't even know
which setting is safe.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.253
- How about the one
that stops the hurting?

18:16.888 --> 18:19.129
Oh, it stopped.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.721
What did you do?

18:20.725 --> 18:22.556
— | flooded your abdomen
with low-frequency

18:22.561 --> 18:24.426
sound wave patterns
at varied harmonic ranges.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.813
- She played it a lullaby.

18:25.814 --> 18:27.770
The baby's sleeping.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.765
You're welcome.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.607
That was nice work.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.119
- Well, it wasn't
hard to counteract

18:40.120 --> 18:41.610
when I realized someone
set the scanner

18:41.621 --> 18:44.408
to stimulate the baby's
adrenaline receptor.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.781
- I'm trying to figure out
what we're dealing with.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.158
No way that's
a normal human kid.

18:48.169 --> 18:51.502
Whoa, is that cell regeneration
even possible?

18:51.506 --> 18:55.169
- No.
But maybe... yes?

18:55.176 --> 18:58.464
Aw, look at you
being all bio-curious.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.553
Admit it,
I'm rubbing off on you.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.922
I mean, not in a sexual way.

19:01.933 --> 19:03.389
Unless you want to...

19:03.393 --> 19:04.633
- |... What?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.225
- Hmm? Sorry.
Reckoning Night.

19:06.229 --> 19:09.141
Anyway, uh, here's the thing.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.639
The Hullen only need us as hosts

19:10.650 --> 19:12.481
because they can't reproduce
on their own.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.567
But if they can use D'Av's
resistance to the plasma,

19:14.571 --> 19:16.857
they won't need us anymore.

19:16.865 --> 19:20.574
- What's to stop them
from wiping us out for good?

19:20.577 --> 19:23.239
That's notjust a baby.

19:23.246 --> 19:24.622
That's our extinction.

19:35.967 --> 19:37.707
- Nice view.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.835
Thanks for the upgrade.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.347
- Oh, don't thank me yet.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.304
Do you recognize where we are?
- Nope.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.924
But I recognize you.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.721
I served her, you know,

19:47.729 --> 19:50.345
our mad commander.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.972
When I first saw you,

19:51.983 --> 19:54.850
I assumed she had a plan.
I mean...

19:54.861 --> 19:58.979
You could practically be her.

19:58.990 --> 20:00.730
I'm sorry.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.858
Did I touch a nerve?

20:02.869 --> 20:04.700
- You know, you talk a lot

20:04.704 --> 20:07.286
for someone's who's about
to watch her entire race

20:07.290 --> 20:08.746
go down screaming.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.035
- It's gonna
take a lot of knives

20:10.043 --> 20:11.908
in a lot of spines, honey.
- No.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.876
We're going to implant
a fabricated memory

20:13.880 --> 20:17.338
in your brain and then upload it
to the Hullen hive mind

20:17.342 --> 20:20.004
and lead your commander
into an ambush.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.047
And you're gonna let us do it.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.047
- Well, that's
refreshingly honest.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.344
And I'm sure the torture
will be delish.

20:27.352 --> 20:29.388
But I'm Hullen, sweetie.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.388
And I will fight you...
forever.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.890
- You still don't see
where we are,

20:34.901 --> 20:38.018
do you?

20:38.029 --> 20:40.406
It's the Latimer-6 system.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.068
There's not much here...

20:42.075 --> 20:44.487
A few old moons...

20:44.494 --> 20:47.031
but one interesting
unnamed planet

20:47.038 --> 20:50.951
that houses a massive
underground pool of plasma.

20:50.959 --> 20:54.076
The one that
was used to turn you.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.375
- There's no way
you could know that.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.714
- We know a lot of things...

20:59.718 --> 21:01.925
Locations of the sources...

21:01.928 --> 21:03.793
and thanks to
the tests that we did

21:03.805 --> 21:05.761
and Johnny's plasma map...

21:05.765 --> 21:08.928
which one is yours.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.096
We also know
that if we destroy it,

21:11.104 --> 21:14.096
we turn you back
to what you were before.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.099
So I don't need to torture you.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.772
I just need to
take away the one thing

21:19.779 --> 21:21.815
that makes you special...

21:21.823 --> 21:23.905
unless you play really nice.

21:26.995 --> 21:30.158
Sorry.
Did I touch a nerve?

21:35.420 --> 21:37.502
Gonna go look
at this other wall now.

21:37.505 --> 21:39.882
Trying to pace myself.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.965
See, I call this one Westy...
- Psst.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.833
— Or, no, wait.
Is this Easty?

21:43.845 --> 21:45.381
I can never get them straight.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.136
You at least gonna
give me one of those,

21:54.147 --> 21:55.887
make it a fair fight?

22:01.988 --> 22:04.570
- Yeah, that's not
how this usually goes.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.566
- War's coming.
It's Reckoning Night.

22:07.577 --> 22:11.536
- Well, jeez, Fancy,
never took you for a Scarboob.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.951
But I suppose you got
as good a reason as any

22:13.958 --> 22:15.073
to want to reckon with me.

22:19.547 --> 22:21.799
- You don't have to
stay trapped.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.461
It's up to you.

22:23.468 --> 22:26.960
- So I walk out of here,
and we're pals again?

22:26.971 --> 22:29.963
Or I'm just another warrant
for you to fill?

22:33.561 --> 22:36.974
- There are no warrants now.

22:36.981 --> 22:40.439
It's war,
and I still don't trust you.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.900
I'm just giving you a chance
to prove me wrong,

22:42.904 --> 22:45.065
the chance you owed me.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.908
- Why tranq her?

22:50.912 --> 22:54.496
- So she won't
remember this part.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.535
- Okay, once we get
the memory implanted,

22:56.543 --> 22:58.579
we put her hand in here,

22:58.586 --> 23:00.042
and everything should be
automatically uploaded

23:00.046 --> 23:01.547
to the Hullen hive mind,

23:01.548 --> 23:04.164
as soon as she
touches the plasma.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.917
You okay?

23:06.928 --> 23:09.169
Listen, Sabine taught me
to memoryjump.

23:09.180 --> 23:11.011
I can do this.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.927
- We have weird jobs.

23:19.315 --> 23:22.523
We're going to implant
a fabricated memory

23:22.527 --> 23:25.189
in your brain, upload it
to the Hullen hive mind,

23:25.196 --> 23:27.232
and lead the commander
to an ambush.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.982
And you're gonna let us do it.

23:29.993 --> 23:31.904
- Stop.

23:31.911 --> 23:35.119
Okay, this is the one
we need to isolate and remove.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.865
Get the next one ready.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.097
Okay, that's the one.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.013
Lock it in.
- I know it... it's risky.

24:01.274 --> 24:04.107
- It's in.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.477
- You better not pee on me.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.607
- Keep 'em coming.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.324
- Round five it is.

24:15.997 --> 24:17.953
Now, while I'm gone
fighting the good fight,

24:17.957 --> 24:20.243
make sure you keep the top-shelf
hokk towards the front,

24:20.251 --> 24:21.991
rotgut in the back.

24:22.003 --> 24:23.618
The drunker these sailors get,

24:23.630 --> 24:25.541
the less discerning
their palates are.

24:25.548 --> 24:26.663
Which reminds me...
- Yeah, yeah.

24:26.674 --> 24:28.665
Hokk, rotgut, got it.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.667
Anything else?

24:30.678 --> 24:32.293
- Thank you?

24:36.017 --> 24:38.224
Might be nice to go
fight a war for a bit.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.640
-Oh...

24:42.649 --> 24:44.310
so now you like my mugs?

24:44.317 --> 24:46.729
- Whoa, do not get crazy.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.148
These are still
dishware felonies.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.316
And after what
we just pulled off,

24:51.324 --> 24:53.656
we need to celebrate.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.242
- Shouldn't we be toasting
to the new daddy?

24:56.245 --> 24:58.031
- I did not have sex
with that woman.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.995
- D'Av, l'm joking.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.409
- Look, I've done a lot of
things I don't always remember...

25:01.417 --> 25:02.998
- D'Av.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.038
Thanks for the plan...

25:05.046 --> 25:07.207
and for not giving up.

25:09.217 --> 25:11.253
- So stupid.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.091
"Check the tech
for us, Pippin."

25:13.096 --> 25:16.133
"Risk your ass
for us, Pippin."

25:16.140 --> 25:19.257
"Make sure the crazy lady
stays sedated, Pippin."

25:19.268 --> 25:22.601
They treat us like slaves, Lucy,
not people.

25:22.605 --> 25:25.642
- I'm a computer, Pippin.
I'm better than a person.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.015
- Okay, easy now.

25:27.026 --> 25:28.436
I'm sure you're very special,

25:28.444 --> 25:32.028
but being human,
we have this kind of

25:32.031 --> 25:34.738
inherent awareness
that's just...

25:34.742 --> 25:37.279
- Are you aware
the prisoner is awake?

25:37.286 --> 25:38.992
-Wha...

25:43.376 --> 25:44.741
- What did you do to me?

25:44.752 --> 25:46.458
- Pippin, I can alert Dutch.

25:46.462 --> 25:48.794
- No.
No, um...

25:48.798 --> 25:51.460
H can handle this.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.378
Morning.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.752
You should be asleep,
little lady.

25:55.763 --> 25:58.220
Um, I can fix this.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.340
- Pippin?

26:00.351 --> 26:02.216
Do you know
what happens to a knife

26:02.228 --> 26:04.093
the longer it's been sitting
in blood and spinal fluid?

26:04.105 --> 26:06.346
- Uh, that's
an oddly specific question.

26:06.357 --> 26:09.315
- It gets wet and slippery,
and then...

26:09.318 --> 26:11.400
it falls out.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.987
- Oh, shit.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.747
- I believe that belongs to me.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.293
- We probably shouldn't
get completely hammered

26:32.300 --> 26:33.756
until we're back.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.341
- Orjust hear me out.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.595
We should because...

26:41.100 --> 26:42.260
You're gonna be okay.

26:44.687 --> 26:47.349
And it's Reckoning Night.

26:49.859 --> 26:52.817
- True.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.151
- Dutch.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.270
- What is it, Lucy?

26:55.281 --> 26:56.270
- Brace for impact.

27:11.756 --> 27:14.873
Lucy, status.

27:14.884 --> 27:16.875
Lucy.

27:19.222 --> 27:20.632
D'Av.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.176
D'Av, wake up.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.147
Lucy, open the cockpit door!

27:40.159 --> 27:43.117
- Sorry, occupied.

27:43.121 --> 27:45.157
I told you to fly the ship,
chew toy,

27:45.164 --> 27:47.746
not crash into an asteroid.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.992
So get us up and running,
or | get mean.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.995
- I'm trying,
but the computer is offline.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.213
Remember the part when I said
that I'm not a pilot?

27:56.217 --> 27:58.708
- The only people
who stay alive on this ship

27:58.719 --> 28:00.334
are the ones who can help me.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.053
I‘d suggest you learn...

28:03.057 --> 28:04.263
fast.

28:05.935 --> 28:08.176
- You make
a compelling argument.

28:10.773 --> 28:13.059
- I know what you did.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.729
The memory implant.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.694
Using me
to get it into the green.

28:18.698 --> 28:22.111
Your little mascot here
told me everything.

28:22.118 --> 28:24.951
-All right, Kitaan,
what do you want?

28:24.954 --> 28:27.115
- I just need to get to
the closest pool of plasma

28:27.123 --> 28:29.455
so I can warn my people, but...

28:29.458 --> 28:33.701
looks like you brought me
to the Latimer—6 system!

28:33.713 --> 28:35.704
Convenient.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.797
Except for your
busted-ass ship.

28:37.800 --> 28:42.089
- Fine.
Open the cockpit doors.

28:42.096 --> 28:44.087
I can help with that.

28:44.098 --> 28:46.965
— Oh, you severed
my spine, darling,

28:46.976 --> 28:49.342
not my brain functions.

28:49.353 --> 28:53.062
Once this ship is online,
I'll be venting all the cabins.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.977
Now, me...
I can survive without oxygen

28:55.985 --> 29:00.194
for a very, very long time.

29:00.198 --> 29:03.235
What about you?

29:03.242 --> 29:06.359
- Daddy, we know.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.326
Now meet Mommy.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.244
- Dutch?

29:12.251 --> 29:14.788
- Well, that's what the RAC
database thought at first,

29:14.795 --> 29:16.751
but we looked more closely.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.372
The DNA strand is actually
a perfect reverse of hers,

29:19.383 --> 29:22.250
which we know belongs to...
- Aneela?

29:22.261 --> 29:25.173
- She didn't tell you?

29:25.181 --> 29:28.218
- Aneela's a ruler,
and rulers have their reasons.

29:28.226 --> 29:30.717
- You're not actually loyal
to her, are you?

29:30.728 --> 29:33.265
- I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.059
But I do need to go now.

29:37.526 --> 29:39.357
- I don't think that
that's a good idea.

29:39.362 --> 29:41.318
-Aneela will need to hear
that you rejected her offer.

29:41.322 --> 29:43.153
Parley is over.

29:43.157 --> 29:46.069
- Well, you didn't hear
my counteroffer. Stay.

29:46.077 --> 29:47.817
Let's observe you,
make sure whatever happened

29:47.828 --> 29:50.319
to your baby
doesn't happen again.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.196
It's like you said...

29:54.418 --> 29:56.033
We are family now.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.160
- Hmm.

29:57.171 --> 29:58.786
So, while I'm here,

29:58.798 --> 30:00.459
I suppose we'll have to
postpone the invasion,

30:00.466 --> 30:04.175
and you can get all your
little war ducks in a row?

30:04.178 --> 30:06.169
I don't think so.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.223
Thank you, John.

30:15.231 --> 30:16.846
I'm sure helping me wasn't easy.

30:16.857 --> 30:18.438
- I'm sorry.

30:18.442 --> 30:21.309
Did you just have
an actual human moment?

30:21.320 --> 30:23.527
- It's hard...

30:23.531 --> 30:26.193
to love something
and then lose it.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.065
| get that now.

30:28.077 --> 30:30.819
- I will never forgive you.

30:30.830 --> 30:33.321
- I wouldn't respect you
if you did.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.461
- Hey, Kitaan.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.329
You've got a problem.

30:42.341 --> 30:45.378
You'll never make it to Latimer
if this ship can't fly.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.593
But let's make this interesting.

30:47.596 --> 30:50.338
l have one last container
of plasma on this ship,

30:50.349 --> 30:53.841
and the only thing standing
between you and it...

30:53.853 --> 30:55.343
is me.

31:01.277 --> 31:03.814
- You do know
the way to a girl's heart.

31:03.821 --> 31:05.857
But I know you, too, sweetie.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.480
- I am not Aneela.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.607
- Oh, I can see that now.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.451
Because as crazy
and broken as she is,

31:12.455 --> 31:14.491
she's a leader.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.454
And you...

31:16.459 --> 31:18.871
you're just an echo of her...

31:18.878 --> 31:20.163
a shadow.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.261
lwin.

32:13.265 --> 32:17.975
Aah! Ugh!

32:17.978 --> 32:19.434
- Shit.

32:31.158 --> 32:32.614
- Oh.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.950
Is this the part
where you threaten to space me

32:34.954 --> 32:36.910
unless I really
help you this time?

32:36.914 --> 32:39.200
- No.

32:39.208 --> 32:41.369
Your memory's in the green now.

32:41.377 --> 32:44.335
Our plan is blown.
My friend's probably gonna die.

32:44.338 --> 32:45.623
You win.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.371
- What do you want?

32:47.383 --> 32:50.375
You can't kill me this way.

32:50.386 --> 32:53.549
I can live out in space forever.

32:56.225 --> 32:57.715
- That's what I'm counting on.

33:00.354 --> 33:02.390
Lucy, take out the trash.
- Gladly.

33:02.398 --> 33:04.309
- Wait! Wait!

33:16.745 --> 33:18.246
- Let's see
if she's still standing

33:18.247 --> 33:19.703
after The Devil's Bullwhip.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.572
Great.

33:21.584 --> 33:23.415
- That's it.

33:23.419 --> 33:25.375
Enough with
the sighs and the stares

33:25.379 --> 33:26.619
and the whatever this is.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.918
Speak now or forever
hold your shade.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.665
- Do you know
it's Reckoning Night?

33:31.677 --> 33:33.463
- Know it?

33:33.471 --> 33:35.427
It's paying for our next
three vacations right now.

33:35.431 --> 33:36.671
- So?

33:36.682 --> 33:38.513
Anything to reckon with me?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.678
Don't I matter to you?

33:40.686 --> 33:43.302
- Oh, Gar-Bear.

33:43.314 --> 33:45.350
Since I've been on Westerley,

33:45.357 --> 33:47.564
I've seen more Reckonings
than I can count.

33:47.568 --> 33:49.775
You know what I found?

33:49.778 --> 33:53.737
What people say when
they think they're gonna die,

33:53.741 --> 33:55.447
that's not what matters.

33:55.451 --> 33:57.737
What matters is that
you come back alive

33:57.745 --> 34:00.282
to the ones you love.

34:00.289 --> 34:02.701
And after all this,

34:02.708 --> 34:06.701
I am coming home to you.

34:08.672 --> 34:11.459
- Okay, I like him!

34:11.467 --> 34:13.958
Thanks, Ma.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.301
- That's your mother?
- Yeah.

34:16.305 --> 34:17.590
I wanted her blessing.

34:17.598 --> 34:19.589
She's my Reckoning.

34:19.600 --> 34:23.388
Also, she's a drunk.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.386
- Welcome to the family.

34:30.444 --> 34:32.184
- What?

34:33.489 --> 34:34.979
- This...

34:34.990 --> 34:37.572
isn't the way we came
from the hangar.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.441
- You're not going
to the hangar.

34:39.453 --> 34:40.738
You're going to the brig.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.032
- Well, you can't do that.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.326
Parley...
- Is a bunch of old words.

34:45.334 --> 34:46.699
And this is war.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.621
- You know what this means,
don't you?

34:48.629 --> 34:51.996
We have 15,000 skyfire missiles
aimed at Westerley.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.508
- I know.

34:53.509 --> 34:55.591
But I have something
even better.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.334
l have the Hullen heir.

34:57.346 --> 35:02.010
- Oh, you are making
a very risky move here.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.678
-And you made a mistake.

35:03.686 --> 35:07.349
You showed me what mattered
to your commander... you.

35:07.356 --> 35:10.348
- Oh, I have to say

35:10.359 --> 35:12.520
I'm almost impressed.

35:12.528 --> 35:14.814
I really didn't expect this
from you, Jaqobis.

35:14.822 --> 35:16.687
- Well, then that was
your other mistake,

35:16.699 --> 35:19.657
because I told you,
Delle Seyah...

35:19.660 --> 35:23.448
you don't know me at all.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.661
Take her.

35:29.878 --> 35:31.664
- Hey, there he is.

35:31.672 --> 35:34.084
Feel like lending a hand?

35:34.091 --> 35:35.672
- Oh, sorry, Pip.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.758
l was trying to figure out
how to say thank you

35:37.761 --> 35:40.548
for telling
our prisoner everything,

35:40.556 --> 35:42.342
crashing our ship,

35:42.349 --> 35:43.634
and knocking Lucy offline.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.473
- Actually, D'Avin,

35:45.477 --> 35:47.388
I remained offline
as part of his plan,

35:47.396 --> 35:49.478
until you were able
to stop the intruder.

35:49.481 --> 35:50.687
- Sorry, what was that, Lucy?

35:50.691 --> 35:52.556
Are you saying that all this

35:52.568 --> 35:55.435
was part of my brilliant ruse
to stall for time?

35:55.446 --> 35:56.811
- It was.

35:56.822 --> 35:58.562
And Pippin even
continued his ruse

35:58.574 --> 36:00.405
by telling the Hullen intruder

36:00.409 --> 36:01.865
that if she did
kill you and Dutch,

36:01.869 --> 36:03.575
he was open to negotiation.
- Thank you.

36:03.579 --> 36:05.410
Lucy, that's fine.

36:05.414 --> 36:06.904
- But it was difficult
to follow this part,

36:06.915 --> 36:10.407
as he was weeping uncontrollably
at the time.

36:10.419 --> 36:13.661
I'm gonna check the coupler.

36:16.675 --> 36:17.664
- Where's Kitaan?

36:17.676 --> 36:19.667
- Orbit.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.839
Look, when we
get back to The Rack,

36:21.847 --> 36:23.428
we're gonna grab John
and get him and Zeph

36:23.432 --> 36:24.717
to nerd-smack the Sonic

36:24.725 --> 36:26.556
into some version
we can actually use.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.891
- D'Av, stop.
- Look, you're still bleeding.

36:27.895 --> 36:29.851
I'll take two seconds...
- Not that.

36:29.855 --> 36:31.720
Just...

36:31.732 --> 36:36.522
All the plans trying to save me,
just, please, stop.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.439
- You really are giving up.

36:38.447 --> 36:40.608
- No.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.197
I'm giving in.

36:47.790 --> 36:50.907
I need you to tell Johnny.

36:50.918 --> 36:53.830
- No.

36:53.837 --> 36:56.874
- I can't tell him.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.964
He can't handle it if I go.

36:58.967 --> 37:02.630
- Why does everybody
always think that I can?

37:02.638 --> 37:04.219
Do you know what you are?

37:04.223 --> 37:06.509
- I'm just trying...
- Selfish.

37:06.517 --> 37:08.883
Standing there bleeding
like you're some kind of martyr,

37:08.894 --> 37:11.636
like the whole universe
rests on your shoulder.

37:11.647 --> 37:12.807
Well, it doesn't.

37:12.815 --> 37:15.477
You're not
some special snowflake.

37:15.484 --> 37:17.770
You know what? You're not even
a very good Killjoy.

37:17.778 --> 37:20.235
You never follow orders.
You drink too much.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.901
You sleep
with all the wrong guys.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.829
- I'm gonna miss
our little talks.

37:33.168 --> 37:35.625
I'm gonna miss...

37:35.629 --> 37:39.713
John's stupid in-jokes
with Lucy.

37:39.717 --> 37:42.003
I'm gonna miss...

37:42.010 --> 37:43.671
that time when John was gone

37:43.679 --> 37:47.592
and it was just me and you...

37:47.599 --> 37:50.511
kicking Hullen ass

37:50.519 --> 37:52.510
and...

37:52.521 --> 37:54.728
drinking too much...

37:54.732 --> 37:56.563
and sleeping
with the wrong people.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.689
Hey.

38:01.697 --> 38:03.562
Remember that, um...

38:03.574 --> 38:07.943
That sexer
at the Leithian Harvest?

38:07.953 --> 38:09.864
- Oh.

38:09.872 --> 38:12.158
Wow, I almost forgot about her.

38:14.042 --> 38:17.626
- What about you and...
Captain Bucktooth?

38:19.965 --> 38:23.833
- He had nice... eyes?

38:23.844 --> 38:26.301
Hands?

38:26.305 --> 38:27.545
- Who can remember?

38:27.556 --> 38:28.636
- Who can remember?

38:37.274 --> 38:40.892
- You're still bleeding.

38:40.903 --> 38:43.235
-We||...

38:43.238 --> 38:45.650
it's Reckoning Night.

there's the worst
whiskey moonshine ever made.

39:39.169 --> 39:42.127
I'll take the bottle.

You can do all

40:28.802 --> 40:30.087
I'm not gonna change my mind.
- Dutch.

40:30.095 --> 40:32.131
— This is the only way.
- I know.

40:33.849 --> 40:36.135
We're in.

40:36.143 --> 40:37.849
- You are?

40:37.853 --> 40:39.013
- I've been with you long enough

40:39.021 --> 40:41.933
to know when
your mind's made up.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.147
But I'm not gonna
let you do it alone.

40:44.151 --> 40:47.518
- We're gonna
infiltrate her ship.

40:47.529 --> 40:52.068
Get me close enough to kill her,
and after that...

40:52.075 --> 40:53.781
after that, I'm gone.

40:56.038 --> 40:58.780
I can't get you out of this,
not this time.

41:00.042 --> 41:02.499
- Why should you get
all the fun?

41:02.502 --> 41:04.083
- So...

41:04.087 --> 41:06.203
should we get shitfaced
for Reckoning Night?

41:06.214 --> 41:10.548
- I've got one last thing
to do, but...

41:10.552 --> 41:13.294
I'll see you
at the Royale, okay?

41:17.184 --> 41:19.846
- So you think
we can get around this?

41:19.853 --> 41:22.219
- I know I'm gonna try
whether she likes it or not.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.266
Oh, yeah, and the baby?

41:24.274 --> 41:26.560
It's yours.
Sorry.
