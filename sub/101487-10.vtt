03:39.762 --> 03:42.387

and it's official:

03:42.539 --> 03:43.780
you all have the flu.

03:43.840 --> 03:45.724
But luckily
you got here in time.

Doc, this is very important.

Okay, good.
I can egg my way through that.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.053
I actually wanted
to talk to you, Peter.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.481
It's very rare
that someone would be around

04:01.575 --> 04:03.817
so many infected people
and not get sick themselves.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.410
So I went ahead and tested you

04:05.603 --> 04:06.912

04:15.831 --> 04:17.089
-What?
-I don't know.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.758
Anyway, this flu season
has decimated the hospital,

04:19.951 --> 04:21.576

04:21.637 --> 04:23.653

04:23.755 --> 04:25.989
Do I get to wear those green

04:26.091 --> 04:27.824
-Yes.
-I'll do it!

04:27.884 --> 04:29.768
Wow. I've never helped anyone
before.

04:29.961 --> 04:32.662
Well, except for that time I
picked the last piece of bread.

04:32.723 --> 04:34.848
Whoa. You picked me.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.683
I've been skipped and flipped

04:36.777 --> 04:38.351
and reached over so many times,

04:38.445 --> 04:39.853
I wasn't sure I'd ever get out.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.521
So, what are you
gonna put on me?

04:41.657 --> 04:43.282
Jelly? Cream cheese?

04:43.433 --> 04:44.691
Maybe some nut butters?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.860

04:54.962 --> 04:57.687
You know, last week's flu scare
got me thinking.

04:57.748 --> 04:59.781
I don't know anything
about my genetic makeup

04:59.800 --> 05:01.949
or what other illnesses
I might be susceptible to.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.210
You know who'd love this story?
Chris.

05:04.363 --> 05:07.306
So, it made me want to do
a 23andMe genetic test.

05:07.457 --> 05:09.533
-Chris!
-It says I'm predisposed

05:09.593 --> 05:10.792
to like caffeine.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.627
So true, so true.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.538
I can't even function
without my caff.

05:14.598 --> 05:15.797
I get all grr.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.207
How many more of these
are there?

05:17.225 --> 05:18.817
Whew, don't have
the Alzheimer's gene.

05:19.010 --> 05:20.877
That's good.

05:20.896 --> 05:22.470
And it says I don't have
the Alzheimer's gene,

05:22.531 --> 05:23.730
so that's good.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.823
Hmm.

05:25.016 --> 05:25.915
Wait, what was that?

05:25.984 --> 05:27.409

-Whoa!

05:36.653 --> 05:38.003

about the Black thing.

05:38.154 --> 05:39.921

06:00.069 --> 06:01.918

to being a nurse

06:01.937 --> 06:03.436

06:05.866 --> 06:06.940

06:07.092 --> 06:08.683
-The next one.
-Fourth of July.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.610
-Say "Christmas."
-Christmas.

06:10.704 --> 06:11.853
-(bell jingles)
-Eh?

06:11.914 --> 06:13.279
That's good nursing.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.873
Yeah, I agree with Chris.

06:15.024 --> 06:16.783
I don't think you have
the makeup to be a nurse.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.710
-You're impatient...
-Are you done?

06:18.862 --> 06:20.103
...and you faint
when you see blood.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.021
Doc, this may sound silly,
but...

07:28.173 --> 07:30.006
(Southern accent):
what do I do?

07:30.066 --> 07:31.783
As a nurse,
it's important to know

07:31.935 --> 07:33.785
how every department
in a hospital works.

07:33.978 --> 07:36.696
So today I need you
to observe surgery.

-It's a pretty sexually driven
show,

08:24.087 --> 08:26.654
-and it kinda gets me going.
-Right, right.
-(keys clacking, message sends)

08:26.673 --> 08:28.581

-So, I'm pretty revved up
and I decide to...

-you know.
-Sure.

-And I don't have
a prayer of finishing

-Like, weird notches.
-Uh-huh.

-So I look over at my side table
and I see the Apple TV remote
-(chiming)

08:37.425 --> 08:39.576
-and I think,
"Well, that could work."
-Right.

08:39.594 --> 08:41.928
-(clacking, sending)
-Before I know it,
I've got six Apple TV remotes

08:42.080 --> 08:43.913
-taped together

-Got it.

19:11.601 --> 19:12.966
He's punching a dead patient.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.652
Oh, yeah. You're right.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.654
Good idea number 47:

19:16.805 --> 19:19.448
<i> Fight Club,</i>
but with hospital people.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.387
(gasps)

19:24.447 --> 19:27.481
(beeping slowly)

19:27.542 --> 19:29.058
You...

19:29.076 --> 19:31.485
♪

19:31.588 --> 19:33.987
...saved me? Why?

19:34.090 --> 19:35.731
Because I hate you.

19:35.791 --> 19:38.009
Every day, I wake up not knowing
if you're gonna

19:38.160 --> 19:39.510
come out of nowhere
and punch me in the face.

19:39.703 --> 19:41.587
I flinch
every time a door opens.

19:41.739 --> 19:42.847
I look over my shoulder

19:43.040 --> 19:44.924
every time I bend down
to tie my shoes.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.910
And I flip my porch light on
every night before I go to bed

19:47.970 --> 19:50.003
just to see
if you're standing there.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.431
Do you have any idea
how exciting that is?

19:52.525 --> 19:55.434
So I didn't save your life
because I like you.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.511
I saved it because...

19:57.530 --> 19:59.605
because I hate you.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.849
I hate you, too, Peter Griffin.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.018
Also, if you die,
I'll be solely responsible

20:05.121 --> 20:07.854
for all the destruction
we've caused over the years,

20:07.916 --> 20:10.708
so this decision is both
emotional and financial.

20:10.859 --> 20:12.693
You can give him his medicine
now, Dr. Hartman.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.861
You haven't been giving him
his medicine?!

20:14.881 --> 20:17.673
Nah, I'm scared of needles so
I've been faking all my nursing.

20:20.002 --> 20:21.385
This guy's nuts.

20:35.092 --> 20:37.026
(refrigerator humming)

20:42.909 --> 20:45.818
(crickets chirping)

20:45.912 --> 20:47.912
Mmm.

20:56.163 --> 20:57.755
Good.
