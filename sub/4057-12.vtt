00:01.102 --> 00:02.412
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.436 --> 00:04.648
You're a harbinger
of death, Jordan.

00:04.672 --> 00:05.916
She'll be safe there.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.484
She's catatonic.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.554
Dread Doctors.

00:08.579 --> 00:11.655
Para scientists in pursuit of
creation of the perfect killer.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.123
And now they've done it.

00:13.147 --> 00:14.691
Hayden. I couldn't save her.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.660
I was trying to kill Scott.
She's gone.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.662
That's it. That's where
I found the bodies.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.852
Four of them.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.035
Any available units,

00:25.059 --> 00:27.304
Beacon Hills telecom
is requesting an 11-5

00:27.328 --> 00:29.039
at the communication towers
off Cypress Lane.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.375
10-4, Dispatch. I'm in the area.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.809
Copy, Unit 5.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.544
A technician was sent
over an hour ago

00:34.568 --> 00:36.446
and telecom hasn't heard back.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.037
Copy, I'm 10-76.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.886
You're gonna drag me
to work every night?

00:42.910 --> 00:44.788
If I have to.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.857
You can't keep an eye
on me 24/7.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.625
You disappeared for three days.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.694
I'm keeping an eye on you for
the rest of your natural born life.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.529
I told you I was with Liam.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.586
Which doesn't
improve your argument.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.468
Maybe you think you can
do your own thing now.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.503
I don't care.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.671
You still need me.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.228
We look out for
each other, remember?

01:11.238 --> 01:12.838
For all I know,
you could have been dead.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.113
Stay here.

02:43.697 --> 02:44.997
Hello?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.445
Beacon County
Sheriff's Department.

02:48.469 --> 02:49.601
Hello?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.105
Help me.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.670
- Liam!
- Sorry!

03:13.694 --> 03:15.205
What are you doing here?

03:15.229 --> 03:16.473
I sent you like 100 texts.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.563
I saw.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.866
You saw? That's it?

03:23.204 --> 03:24.814
How could you not
tell me that you're alive?

03:24.838 --> 03:26.471
Maybe because you
left me for dead.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.141
You were dead.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.244
Liam, you need to go.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.251
Here...

03:47.428 --> 03:49.661
Still here.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.542
What the hell is that? Run.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.763
Hayden, run!

04:46.787 --> 04:48.565
What is that thing?

04:48.589 --> 04:51.156
Liam, what is it? I
don't know! Just run!

05:02.970 --> 05:05.148
Jump. Are you kidding?

05:05.172 --> 05:07.139
We can make it. Come on.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.050
See, I told you.

05:30.264 --> 05:31.675
Do you trust me?

05:31.699 --> 05:33.098
What? No.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.521
What are you doing?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.723
Making sure you're alive.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.858
Oh, I can't move my legs.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.793
Argh, I think my back's broken.

06:23.817 --> 06:24.861
Will it heal?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.196
Eventually. I think.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.330
Good.

06:27.354 --> 06:28.898
Whoa! Where are you going?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.734
To find my sister
and make sure she's okay.

06:30.758 --> 06:31.835
You're going to
just leave me here?

06:31.859 --> 06:33.570
You pulled me off a cliff.

06:33.594 --> 06:34.804
I'm lucky I healed.

06:34.828 --> 06:35.805
I saved your life.

06:35.829 --> 06:36.928
This time.

06:38.332 --> 06:39.564
Who saved it last time?

06:42.603 --> 06:43.603
Theo.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.688
Tracy?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.165
Looks like he remembers you.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.049
I'll take care of it
if you want me to.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.385
All you have to do is ask.

07:22.409 --> 07:25.255
My dad defended someone
on death row once.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.878
You know how
lethal injection works?

07:31.251 --> 07:34.119
One of the drugs they use
paralyzes your diaphragm.

07:37.391 --> 07:39.458
Makes it impossible to breathe.

08:05.252 --> 08:07.185
This is from the relay
station's security camera.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.470
That looked big.

08:13.494 --> 08:16.406
And too fast for anyone
to get a good look at it.

08:16.430 --> 08:18.110
But you already know
what it is, don't you?

08:20.667 --> 08:21.733
The last Chimera.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.953
You still got a black light?

08:48.729 --> 08:50.095
Mercury means Chimera.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.511
But what was it doing here?

08:54.535 --> 08:56.946
Why come here and kill some
random communications tech?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.115
Maybe it just likes to kill.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.305
Maybe it's what it does.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.552
That's terrifying.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.554
Parrish, how many bodies
do you actually see

09:04.578 --> 09:06.244
when you dream
about the Nemeton?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.419
Everyone.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.588
The story Theo told me
about the library.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.892
That's how it happened.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.595
Except it didn't happen to him.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.512
Yeah.

11:42.536 --> 11:46.905
Stiles, I can't protect you
if I don't know the truth.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.822
Did you really feel
like you couldn't tell me?

11:52.846 --> 11:55.224
I couldn't tell anyone.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.727
Did you think that I wouldn't
believe that it was self-defense?

11:57.751 --> 11:58.783
What if it wasn't?

12:01.488 --> 12:03.221
What if I told you
I wanted him dead?

12:04.024 --> 12:05.835
I'd believe you.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.005
I also believe that
wanting someone dead

12:09.029 --> 12:12.709
and murdering them are
two very different things.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.043
Yeah, but what if
the judge didn't think so?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.845
Then to hell with the judge.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.548
Stiles, it was self-defense,

12:18.572 --> 12:21.250
and I would destroy
every shred of evidence

12:21.274 --> 12:22.741
to protect you if I had to.

12:23.777 --> 12:26.055
I would burn
the whole sheriff's station

12:26.079 --> 12:27.245
to the ground.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.072
What about upholding the law?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.662
What about Kira?

12:46.266 --> 12:47.999
Kira was a mistake.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.006
I guess I'm learning
how to bend.

12:57.944 --> 13:00.211
So, what, it just goes away?

13:01.148 --> 13:03.693
Not for you.

13:03.717 --> 13:07.196
The problem now is
how to bear this burden.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.121
This kind of thing is not at all
uncommon in law enforcement.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.068
A fatal mistake.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.658
A partner who dies.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.827
Or one who gets paralyzed.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.142
Stiles, you carry that with you.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.912
Sometimes it doesn't
truly feel okay again

13:22.936 --> 13:26.704
until there's
a kind of counterbalance.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.506
Like what?

13:29.843 --> 13:31.654
Like instead of taking a life,

13:31.678 --> 13:33.545
you manage to save one.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.895
Something like that can help,
but maybe only for a moment.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.731
But the real conflict
you're having now

13:41.755 --> 13:44.155
is between your head
and your heart.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.403
Your head.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.605
Your head knows
that the only crime

13:49.629 --> 13:51.596
you committed was surviving.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.011
But your heart?

13:55.035 --> 13:58.503
Your heart still
thinks it was murder.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.840
So I guess you, uh...

14:03.944 --> 14:06.110
You gotta get your heart
to catch up to your head.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.293
I feel like it's more
than guilt though,

14:10.317 --> 14:11.683
you know, I feel like...

14:14.120 --> 14:16.332
I feel like I lost something.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.524
You know, I feel like
I can't get it back.

14:23.396 --> 14:24.896
You won't.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.366
Not entirely.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.770
But you get a little bit
by forgiving yourself.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.354
And since that's not always the
easiest thing in the world to do,

14:38.378 --> 14:40.778
then maybe you start by
forgiving someone else.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.216
Someone who probably
really needs it.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.719
Someone like Scott.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.434
How much did you take, Josh?

15:04.170 --> 15:06.082
A lot.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.683
And I don't feel a thing.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.819
You won't. Your body
heals too fast.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.854
Yeah? Then maybe you
should have left me dead.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.746
Or maybe you just need
to feel something else.

15:19.719 --> 15:20.818
Something better.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.934
How does that feel?

16:00.393 --> 16:01.904
You didn't have to come
all the way out here.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.208
You weren't
answering your phone.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.363
I can't help you.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.810
Not right now.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.712
What if I told you that you're
the only one that I have left?

16:09.736 --> 16:10.813
You're not going
to want my help.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.148
Anything that happened
between us...

16:12.172 --> 16:14.116
I'm talking about something
that's going to happen.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.952
Something I'm going to do.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.976
And you're not going to
like me much after I do it.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.034
Is that why I hear two
other heartbeats in there?

16:24.851 --> 16:26.131
And why yours is
beating so fast?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.052
Scott, go home.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.489
I can't help.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.259
Did you get anything out of him?

16:57.283 --> 16:59.117
Not yet.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.534
You think you can make me talk?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.036
I am Spetsnaz.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.771
Soviet Special Forces.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.962
In battle, we kill
our own wounded.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.377
You could tear out
my fingernails,

17:14.401 --> 17:16.479
cut my lips with razors.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.446
I'll still say nothing.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.281
Correct me if I'm wrong,

17:20.306 --> 17:23.285
but your section is out
of work and broke, right?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.186
You won't get a word out of me.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.211
What if we paid you $10,000?

17:30.050 --> 17:32.828
The Desert Wolf was last seen
close to the Canadian border.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.463
She won't travel by plane.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.799
She will stay away from
surveillance cameras when she can.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.801
Then we still have some time.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.369
There's another
reason she won't fly.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.526
She's not traveling alone.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.375
What do you mean?

17:46.399 --> 17:48.210
She has a hostage.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.300
An animal doctor.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.083
Deaton.

17:54.107 --> 17:56.685
I went to the club looking
for Hayden, and there's Josh.

17:56.709 --> 17:57.987
Standing there.
Completely alive.

17:58.011 --> 18:00.656
Just like Hayden.
Because of Theo.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.013
Theo brought them both back.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.093
That's what he's doing.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.694
He's, he's building a pack.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.830
His own pack of dead Chimeras.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.254
They both looked
pretty alive to me.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.101
But they're not the same.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.670
There was something
about Hayden.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.772
There's something
wrong about her.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.574
Maybe that's what
dying does to you.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.010
What if it, what if it
like darkens your soul.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.533
What if they're all evil now?

18:23.903 --> 18:25.036
Hey, guys!

18:27.307 --> 18:29.307
Are you volunteering for
the library clean-up, too?

18:31.044 --> 18:32.621
Yeah. Yes.

18:32.645 --> 18:33.811
Yeah.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.024
So...

18:48.561 --> 18:49.627
You're alive.

18:51.831 --> 18:52.997
Yeah.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.815
That must
have been pretty difficult

18:59.839 --> 19:01.817
to explain to your parents.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.052
Not really.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.721
They didn't notice me
much before that.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.491
I think they're just glad 'cause they
think they can sue the hospital now.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.226
They gotta be happy
you're alive, though?

19:10.250 --> 19:11.315
Are you?

19:12.185 --> 19:13.317
Me?

19:13.853 --> 19:15.164
Yeah, I'm...

19:15.188 --> 19:17.099
Alive is definitely
better than dead.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.934
You know, much better.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.503
You have no idea
what to say to me, do you?

19:20.527 --> 19:22.905
Not really, no.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.406
Can I ask you a question then?

19:24.430 --> 19:25.908
Yeah, sure.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.498
What are you
doing Saturday night?

19:46.686 --> 19:47.663
Is that my laptop?

19:47.687 --> 19:48.786
Yep.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.500
Do you have my password?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.602
I have all your passwords.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.437
You know they just brought in
another body from last night?

19:55.461 --> 19:58.040
Yeah, I was hoping
you wouldn't find out.

19:58.064 --> 19:59.275
Now give me my damn computer.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.565
Hang on, hang on.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.680
I think there's
some footage missing.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.448
Or something missing
in the footage.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.784
I think there's something
missing in your head.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.374
You need your rest.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.302
Don't be afraid.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.652
You're really turning this in?

22:56.676 --> 22:58.487
I know what I saw.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.890
"Deputy was attacked by an enormous
animal of undetermined species."

23:01.914 --> 23:03.147
Yeah, that makes things clear.

23:06.652 --> 23:07.996
Are we leaving?

23:08.020 --> 23:10.121
Not yet. And don't move.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.155
You shouldn't be here.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.990
Why not?

23:35.014 --> 23:36.180
My record's spotless.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.728
Are you going to tell me
what you saw last night?

23:39.752 --> 23:41.419
It was exactly
like the painting.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.688
Exactly what you said.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.905
Have you told anyone else?

23:49.929 --> 23:51.407
I didn't think you'd want me to.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.608
You're right.

23:52.632 --> 23:53.942
But I don't know why.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.712
And you don't have to.

23:56.736 --> 24:01.216
Look, that thing out there
is going to kill a lot of people.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.320
But it's not going to kill
us. Not if we're together.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.481
Anything else
you want to tell me?

24:13.553 --> 24:14.553
Not really.

24:21.494 --> 24:25.607
Look, I don't want this
to sound like a warning,

24:25.631 --> 24:27.751
and I definitely don't want
it to sound like a threat.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.902
But you can't hide
anything from me, Hayden.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.039
Remember that.

24:59.765 --> 25:00.898
Hey.

25:02.435 --> 25:04.480
Still not healing?

25:04.504 --> 25:06.070
Sometimes it just
takes a little longer.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.240
What are you doing here?

25:10.476 --> 25:11.987
Ah, you heard about
the guy who got killed out

25:12.011 --> 25:13.377
at the communication
towers, right?

25:16.649 --> 25:18.249
I think I may have
figured something out.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.018
What, you want my help?

25:23.789 --> 25:26.957
Yeah, well you said you can
find the clues that I can't.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.395
Here, take a look.

25:33.466 --> 25:35.110
This is when the
technician first arrived.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.567
You see him going in?

25:37.737 --> 25:39.815
Then Deputy Clark goes in.

25:39.839 --> 25:40.949
Then something really big

25:40.973 --> 25:42.718
and really fast
comes charging out.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.152
And now comes Clark.

25:44.176 --> 25:47.478
Eventually, technician's body
is carried out by paramedics.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.616
Okay, what am I missing?

25:54.020 --> 25:55.564
Two people go in.
Three come out.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.332
I checked all the footage.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.368
Not a single person
enters that building

25:59.392 --> 26:00.832
before the technician
the entire day.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.139
So where does that something

26:04.163 --> 26:05.796
really big and
really fast come from?

26:09.569 --> 26:10.901
There's another way in.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.487
He's leaving. What's the plan?

26:18.511 --> 26:19.721
I have a date
with him on Saturday.

26:19.745 --> 26:20.923
I thought that was the plan.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.357
You were supposed
to ask about Theo.

26:22.381 --> 26:23.592
We can't wait until Saturday.

26:23.616 --> 26:26.595
Sorry, but Theo leading
an evil Chimera pack

26:26.619 --> 26:28.764
wasn't exactly a natural
progression to the conversation.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.487
Fine. I'll talk to him.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.478
You don't have to
hide from me, Corey.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.763
I was trying to
do something nice.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.432
You were trying to
do something normal.

27:03.456 --> 27:06.068
But you don't have to
be normal anymore,

27:06.092 --> 27:08.270
and you definitely
don't have to be nice.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.805
Well, I'm not going
to hurt them.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.640
Look, I don't want you to.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.542
In fact, they don't know it yet,

27:13.566 --> 27:15.444
but we're going to protect them.

27:15.468 --> 27:17.201
Just like I'm going
to protect you.

27:21.507 --> 27:24.720
So you're going to come with me

27:24.744 --> 27:26.955
and you're gonna do
everything that I tell you,

27:26.979 --> 27:28.712
because I know you
don't want to die again.

27:31.517 --> 27:32.583
Do you, Corey?

27:36.989 --> 27:38.055
Okay.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.708
You see that?

27:59.178 --> 28:00.611
I see blood.

28:01.514 --> 28:02.846
Look where it leads to.

29:05.177 --> 29:07.255
Corey's not texting me back.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.590
Because he left with Theo.

29:08.614 --> 29:09.747
Are you sure?

29:11.450 --> 29:12.783
He was here.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.621
Well then, we should
do something, right?

29:19.225 --> 29:20.324
We should tell someone.

29:22.394 --> 29:26.174
Liam, you have to tell him.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.631
You think he'll even talk to me?

29:29.201 --> 29:30.278
You're his Beta.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.668
Doesn't he have to?

29:32.271 --> 29:33.837
Where would I even start?

29:35.241 --> 29:38.186
"Sorry for trying to kill you"?

29:38.210 --> 29:41.456
"Sorry for leaving you for dead
so that Theo could kill you"?

29:41.480 --> 29:44.726
If, if you start off with sorry,

29:44.750 --> 29:47.684
the rest probably
won't even matter.

30:03.769 --> 30:06.581
I have been here
a long time, Lydia.

30:06.605 --> 30:08.372
You think I haven't
seen this before?

30:10.109 --> 30:12.621
I know when patients
are pretending.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.545
Manipulating to
get what they want.

30:16.682 --> 30:17.959
You're not getting out of here.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.961
Someone as dangerous as you are?

30:19.985 --> 30:22.019
We can keep you here
for the rest of your life.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.173
You have to wake up.

30:31.197 --> 30:33.809
What if I can't?

30:33.833 --> 30:36.344
Then you won't be
able to help your friends

30:36.368 --> 30:39.414
and they'll die without you.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.104
How am I supposed to
help them like this?

30:43.509 --> 30:45.520
You learned to
fight, didn't you?

30:45.544 --> 30:47.789
Only a little.

30:47.813 --> 30:50.358
You learned more
than you think you did,

30:50.382 --> 30:53.161
and faster than
an ordinary person could.

30:53.185 --> 30:54.963
But that doesn't matter now.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.286
It does.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.801
Because I'll teach you the rest.

30:59.825 --> 31:03.227
I'm going to show you
how to use your voice.

31:04.630 --> 31:07.965
How to use it as a weapon.

31:42.868 --> 31:44.312
What is that?

31:44.336 --> 31:45.569
It looks like Latin.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.139
Hold up that light.
I'm gonna get a picture of it.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.014
Stiles, hold the light still.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.935
Scott, behind you!

32:26.578 --> 32:27.811
Sucks, doesn't it?

32:41.126 --> 32:42.492
Okay!

32:44.630 --> 32:46.496
Maybe they're not ready
to take on an Alpha.

32:50.235 --> 32:51.780
Especially one
that can smell fear.

32:51.804 --> 32:52.804
He's got fangs.

32:56.108 --> 32:57.485
What did you do?

32:57.509 --> 32:59.487
I found some new friends.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.877
I don't take rejection well.

33:05.684 --> 33:07.985
- Hey, Theo!
- Stiles.

33:14.259 --> 33:15.603
You're going to
leave here thinking

33:15.627 --> 33:18.328
that you need to worry about me.

33:19.365 --> 33:20.909
But you're wrong.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.699
We're actually back
on the same side.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.402
Because that thing...

33:26.605 --> 33:28.450
That's what we need
to worry about.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.852
Your pack and mine.

33:30.876 --> 33:33.621
We're gonna go back to school and
pretend like we're normal teenagers,

33:33.645 --> 33:35.657
but at night, we're going to
be fighting for our lives.

33:35.681 --> 33:36.825
What is it?

33:36.849 --> 33:37.959
It's not a Chimera.

33:37.983 --> 33:39.461
But it's just a kid underneath.

33:39.485 --> 33:40.485
Someone like us.

33:41.687 --> 33:42.886
Not anymore.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.026
Scott, I need to talk to you!

33:52.197 --> 33:53.463
Scott?

34:04.877 --> 34:06.309
What are you doing here?

34:07.346 --> 34:08.378
Looking for you.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.226
Is that okay with Theo?

34:11.250 --> 34:12.494
Probably not.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.884
Why are you here?

34:14.253 --> 34:15.851
Because you are.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.346
Did you really almost
kill Scott to save me?

34:31.370 --> 34:32.835
It was a supermoon.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.652
But...

34:37.676 --> 34:41.489
Yeah, I guess I did.

34:41.513 --> 34:43.480
That's really screwed up, Liam.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.262
He's one of your best friends.

34:47.286 --> 34:50.152
Yeah, now you're with Theo
who told me to kill him.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.091
Something's different now.

34:55.960 --> 35:00.197
I don't know why,
but ever since coming back,

35:01.567 --> 35:03.266
nothing feels the same.

35:05.070 --> 35:06.536
Nothing feels right.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.707
Nothing?

35:12.611 --> 35:13.944
Except for you.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.618
You're the only thing
that feels the same.

35:23.388 --> 35:24.988
The only thing that feels right.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.994
I guess I just want to
know how you feel about me.

36:10.769 --> 36:11.813
He knew what it meant

36:11.837 --> 36:13.982
and I can't remember the words.

36:14.006 --> 36:15.672
Damnatio Memoriae.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.544
It means the condemnation
of memory.

36:21.780 --> 36:22.824
I think it also
means that whatever

36:22.848 --> 36:24.325
the Dread Doctors created,

36:24.349 --> 36:25.860
whatever this last
Chimera really is,

36:25.884 --> 36:27.295
it's not something new.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.451
It's something old.

36:29.221 --> 36:31.032
Really old.

36:31.056 --> 36:32.700
So they didn't
create a new creature.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.057
They resurrected one.

36:49.241 --> 36:52.442
Nothing pleases me more
than a surprise visit.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.525
Do you know why I'm here?

36:57.549 --> 36:59.549
I have heard rumors.

37:00.752 --> 37:04.032
A few bits of gossip
manage to reach

37:04.056 --> 37:07.123
even this dark corner
of Beacon Hills.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.141
How long have you had that?

38:10.389 --> 38:12.800
All this to help Scott?

38:12.824 --> 38:15.225
You know about the
Dread Doctors, don't you?

38:16.461 --> 38:17.739
So they did succeed?

38:17.763 --> 38:19.140
Tell me what it is.

38:19.164 --> 38:21.498
Oh, not what it is. What it was.

38:22.668 --> 38:26.147
A monster whose
only purpose was to kill.

38:26.171 --> 38:29.784
Not for sustenance,
not for revenge,

38:29.808 --> 38:33.321
not for any rational impulse

38:33.345 --> 38:38.493
other than the drive to
end life wherever it's found.

38:38.517 --> 38:42.519
It also has a rather personal
connection to our family.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.158
La Bete.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.760
The Beast of Gevaudan.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.680
We need help.

38:58.704 --> 38:59.914
If Theo's got his own pack now

38:59.938 --> 39:01.349
then we need ours.

39:01.373 --> 39:02.850
We have to get the others back.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.074
The others?

39:05.277 --> 39:07.255
You mean Kira
who's currently battling

39:07.279 --> 39:08.956
a homicidal fox spirit
inside of her,

39:08.980 --> 39:11.025
Malia who isn't even speaking
to either one of us,

39:11.049 --> 39:12.160
Lydia who's stuck
in Eichen House,

39:12.184 --> 39:13.861
and Liam who almost killed you?

39:13.885 --> 39:15.585
Also known as our best friends.

39:18.623 --> 39:19.789
Okay, how?

39:21.693 --> 39:22.859
One by one.

39:25.731 --> 39:27.642
You're not seriously going
to make me do it?

39:27.666 --> 39:29.399
You're part of the
pack, right? Okay.

39:47.319 --> 39:48.551
We need to find Kira.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.001
I still hate that tattoo.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.091
I know.

40:10.275 --> 40:11.552
How do we find them?

40:11.576 --> 40:14.422
Skinwalkers are
powerful shapeshifters

40:14.446 --> 40:17.347
and not particularly welcoming
to strangers on their land.

40:18.216 --> 40:19.315
They'll find us.

40:24.589 --> 40:25.589
Mom...

40:26.925 --> 40:28.324
I think they already have.

40:58.623 --> 40:59.967
Kira.

40:59.991 --> 41:01.324
Take out your sword.
