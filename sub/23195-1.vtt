Away from the keyboard.

06:02.125 --> 06:03.915
Let's see if we can have fun along with him.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.540
Yes ..

06:10.540 --> 06:13.250
Mom! Where is the iodine?

06:13.833 --> 06:15.375
Whatever it is, boy.

Burning ...

07:30.333 --> 07:31.083
Burn!

07:32.415 --> 07:34.582
Well, what do you call this movement?

07:35.540 --> 07:37.582
You know what? That's not really a movement ...

07:37.583 --> 07:39.125
I ... I ... I ...

07:39.458 --> 07:40.333

Who was that guy?

07:46.083 --> 07:47.041
So, uh ...

07:47.040 --> 07:48.707
Well, I guess, uh ...
