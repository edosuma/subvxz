00:40.600 --> 00:41.800
Fire drill! Quick!

00:53.080 --> 00:55.040
Drills don't have smoke, do they?

00:56.680 --> 00:58.000
Miss Hardbroom's on fire!

01:03.760 --> 01:06.080
Neat lines, girls.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.080
No fidgeting, no talking, no...

01:14.520 --> 01:17.520
need to ask which pupil...

01:18.160 --> 01:20.000
is responsible...

01:21.000 --> 01:22.400
for this.

01:22.760 --> 01:23.760
Uh...

01:24.120 --> 01:25.120
You looked...

01:26.040 --> 01:29.920
The smoke was for effect,
to prepare us for the real thing.

01:32.080 --> 01:33.480
Line up now, please.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.440
It's Super Mildred,
the most heroic witch in the school.

01:49.520 --> 01:51.400
At least I'm not the most selfish.

02:01.640 --> 02:06.120
Imagine sometime in the future,
you look back to fire safety at Cackle's.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.840
What do you remember?

02:10.039 --> 02:14.760
Nothing but squabbling and petty sniping
because you weren't paying attention.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.080
Sorry, Miss Cackle.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.640
Sorry, Miss Cackle.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.480
This feud has gone on for long enough.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.400
Don't be sorry, be better.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.440
<i>♪ Full of joy we mix our potions ♪</i>

02:39.800 --> 02:42.920

02:43.000 --> 02:46.360

02:55.080 --> 02:57.760
Very rousing. Well sung, girls.

02:58.120 --> 03:00.240
Please be seated for notices.

03:04.080 --> 03:07.000
We will shortly be welcoming
a new teacher,

03:07.080 --> 03:09.680
Miss Mould, to the school.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.720
She will be your art mistress.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.160
I love art.

03:17.480 --> 03:21.560
And you will be pleased to hear
our rebuild is imminent.

03:21.920 --> 03:27.000
The last few hundred stones
are ready to be de-magicked.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.880
The Founding Stone will be on display
in here

03:30.960 --> 03:34.400
until we've secured its new home
under the east wing.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.840
This really is a unique opportunity
to see something very special.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.680
"See" being the operative word.

03:41.200 --> 03:47.320
Any pupil attempting to touch the stone
will be immediately expelled.

03:47.400 --> 03:48.480
Indeed.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.960
Anyway, I heartily encourage you all
to take a close look while you can.

04:24.360 --> 04:28.640
"The ancient magical council
granted a stone for each witching academy."

04:30.160 --> 04:32.520
"Without a stone, there is no school."

04:33.560 --> 04:35.520
Acts like a battery, apparently.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.280
Keeps the place charged up
so the magic doesn't run out.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.600
Is that why they've got
a teacher guarding it?

04:41.680 --> 04:43.480
Probably 'cause it's so powerful, too.

04:43.560 --> 04:47.240
If it does all that for the school,
imagine what it can do for a single witch.

04:48.600 --> 04:49.600
Ugh.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.280
Witch ball practice kerfuffle.
I'll have to step out for a second.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.000
No one touch the stone!

05:00.360 --> 05:03.520
It's beautiful,
just like when I found it.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.360
- Ethel!
- What?

05:06.440 --> 05:09.400
She likes stones so much,
I thought she might want to be one.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.400
Curiouser and curiouser.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.040
Turn her back!

05:39.640 --> 05:42.000
So, you're a bully now?
As well as a cheat?

05:42.080 --> 05:45.800
Your project knocked me off my broom.
You practically gave it to me.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.120
That's not what happened!

05:47.200 --> 05:48.200
Who cares?

05:48.320 --> 05:51.280
You will,
when I turn you into a pig again!

05:51.840 --> 05:55.560
- As if you can remember that spell.
- Okay, you asked for it.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.560
Wait, Mil, you've got something
on your back.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.800
- Don't try to stop me!
- She's not.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.600
- Look.
- At what?

06:04.360 --> 06:07.040
A weird, glowing hand thing.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.560
Ethel's got the same!

06:08.840 --> 06:09.960
No, I haven't.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.800
Miss Mould must have sent it on ahead.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.400
How very modern.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.440
Ada told me she requested to teach here.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.560
Rather irregular, don't you think?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.520
What do you suppose
she plans to do with it?

06:30.920 --> 06:32.120
One can only guess.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.480
A more frivolous waste of time
is difficult to fathom.

06:37.720 --> 06:41.000
Well, a few art lessons
never did anybody any harm.

06:41.640 --> 06:45.960
Have you met our pupils, Miss Bat?
They can barely mix a potion.

06:46.520 --> 06:52.440
Any time away from academic rigor
will hurt them very seriously indeed.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.080
- Are you hurt, Ethy?
- I don't think so.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.160
What happened?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.720
- Get off!
- You get off!

07:20.800 --> 07:22.680
- Mildred!
- I'm not doing anything!

07:22.760 --> 07:25.440
Get away from me!

07:25.920 --> 07:28.160
I don't think that's possible.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.560
You seem to be sharing an arm now.

07:32.880 --> 07:37.320
There appears to be a fusion
at a molecular level.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.040
Is that bad? Sounds bad.

07:40.520 --> 07:45.040
No, I did an excellent job.
Some of my best work, in fact.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.640
I set a self-activating friendship trap.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.920
Sadly, you both fell into it hat first.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.640
A what-what, Miss Cackle?

07:56.720 --> 07:58.240
You were arguing again?

07:59.200 --> 08:02.480
The negative energy
between you made the trap react,

08:02.800 --> 08:04.560
bonding you together.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.720
Once that energy's gone,
the bond will be broken.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.880
- So, we only get separated if we're...
- Friends?

08:13.240 --> 08:14.600
Friends.

08:15.880 --> 08:19.280
Now, that won't be so bad, will it, girls?

08:24.480 --> 08:25.800
We have to get to class.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.640
Tell them I'm poorly.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.760
Every time I go out there,
something scary happens.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.640
Ethel's going to be okay.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.280
Esme wasn't okay
when she lost her powers.

08:35.919 --> 08:39.400
I wasn't okay when you gave me
that fake courage potion.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.559
You were fine... before you found out.

08:42.880 --> 08:47.800
When bad things happen to good witches,
it's usually a curse.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.600
That's what's happening.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.840
- My sisters and I must be cursed!
- No, you're not.

08:53.920 --> 08:56.360
And hiding
under a blanket won't change anything.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.360
I want be left on my own now, please.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.240
Can I just...

09:21.920 --> 09:23.720
Ethel, I need to cut my food.

09:23.800 --> 09:24.800
Improvise.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.440
We need to break this. Fast.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.720
Just try and be nice to each other.

09:30.920 --> 09:31.840
Smile a bit.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.640
Give each other a few compliments.
That will do it.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.080
Your ponytail is very...

09:43.360 --> 09:44.720
swishy today, Ethel.

09:46.280 --> 09:50.680
I, um, like your... socks.

09:55.880 --> 09:58.960
A word of advice. You have to mean it.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.280
There's no fooling the trap.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.760
Hey, Mithel. You wanna partner up?

10:10.200 --> 10:12.840
- "Mithel"?
- It's your names smooshed together.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.800
Saves time now that you're one person.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.280
We are not one person!

10:16.800 --> 10:20.040
- And anyway, it's obviously Ethred.
- No, it is not!

10:20.120 --> 10:22.280
Guys, negative energy, remember?

10:24.080 --> 10:25.280
What's that?

10:27.480 --> 10:29.360
Where's this new teacher, anyway?

10:29.680 --> 10:30.680
She's late.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.560
This room looks amazing.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.600
Oh.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.200
Actually, I'm right on time.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.800
Hello, Year Two.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.360
Are you ready to have some fun?

11:01.520 --> 11:03.840
Ethel's fine, and you aren't cursed.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.960
We saw some second years at lunch.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.080
Miss Cackle set the spell on purpose.

11:10.120 --> 11:12.960
Come on,
let's go to Spell Science.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.960
It'll be utterly boring, I promise.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.640
I'm good, thanks.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.120
Are cats in bed with you?

11:28.640 --> 11:31.160
Sorry for being such a worrywart.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.320
That's okay.
It's just we should really get to...

11:36.800 --> 11:40.400
- Does it come with instructions?
- It most certainly does not!

11:41.280 --> 11:44.240
Should we maybe weigh it out first?

11:44.400 --> 11:46.440
Does this look like a potions lab?

11:46.720 --> 11:47.840
Definitely not.

11:48.360 --> 11:49.360
Exactly!

11:50.120 --> 11:56.200
Because in here we don't weigh,
or measure, or follow instructions.

11:56.680 --> 12:01.040
In here, we let our imaginations run wild.

12:02.320 --> 12:03.320
Well, go on!

12:04.240 --> 12:07.960
Scoop it, knead it. See what happens.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.240
Mm.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.600
You two seem very... close.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.480
It's a friendship trap.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.360
We would find things so much easier

12:21.440 --> 12:23.400
if you'd be kind enough to break it
for us.

12:24.640 --> 12:28.520
And why would I do that when you clearly
make such an excellent team?

12:30.760 --> 12:32.240
Oh, very nice work, Mildred.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.040
You're a natural.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.320
And one-handed, too. Impressive.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.200
Oh, my hat!

12:50.520 --> 12:53.280
Sorry, it's my asthma.

12:54.760 --> 12:59.360
I know some of you may be wondering
what has all this to do with witchcraft.

13:01.640 --> 13:06.040
Well, with magic, you need to be creative
to get the best out of it.

13:06.520 --> 13:10.000
This is where art helps.
It really stretches your...

13:10.080 --> 13:12.480
Snakes!

13:12.560 --> 13:13.600
Oh.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.680
And who invited our friends here
to join the party?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.960
Mildred. Trying to show off.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.920
Why would I ruin my own pot?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.480
You ruin everything else.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.520
Can someone please get rid of those?

13:25.200 --> 13:27.640
You do know
how a friendship trap works?

13:27.720 --> 13:29.720
They look pretty angry, Miss Mould.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.680
Yes, we have to be nice to each other
to get out of it.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.320
And if you're not nice...

13:35.920 --> 13:38.240
it sticks... forever.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.760
Uh, Miss Mould, the snakes!

13:41.280 --> 13:43.680
Ah, yes. Smithereens!

13:47.440 --> 13:48.440
Yuck.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.000
Oh!

13:52.080 --> 13:55.080
Perhaps that was
a little too creative there.

14:03.280 --> 14:04.840
Enough.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.080
Well met.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.640
Marigold Mould. And you must be...

14:09.880 --> 14:12.320
Class is dismissed.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.440
You aren't even trying.

14:44.520 --> 14:48.560
- You're making it impossible.
- To break the trap, I mean.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.560
You jinxing my pot
has probably made it stronger.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.080
You heard Miss Mould.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.360
That excuse for a witch?
She knows nothing.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.560
What's up with you?
You've been nastier than ever this term.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.680
No, I haven't, toad brain.

15:03.440 --> 15:06.800
- Is it 'cause you miss Esmerelda?
- Why would I miss her?

15:06.880 --> 15:09.760
She gets more attention than ever
now that she's powerless.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.280
Has she really got no magic left at all?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.040
She gave it away, didn't she?

15:14.320 --> 15:15.920
Can't she get it back again?

15:16.440 --> 15:19.520
Agatha took it,
so she has to return it.

15:20.880 --> 15:21.920
So Esme's stuck.

15:22.720 --> 15:23.720
That's awful.

15:25.920 --> 15:28.080
Anyway, I've got prep to do.

15:28.440 --> 15:30.320
Stop trying to distract me.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.200
When is this going to stop?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.880
Just have to ride it out sometimes.

16:00.240 --> 16:02.800
Not again. Not again.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.400
Thanks. Sorry.

16:07.320 --> 16:08.640
Where have you been?

16:09.120 --> 16:11.480
Everywhere, unfortunately.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.800
Um... What are you doing with that?

16:24.240 --> 16:28.600
I made no secret of the fact that I'd be
taking a more unconventional approach.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.520
And what, precisely, do the girls learn

16:30.600 --> 16:33.560
from being unconventionally sprayed
with clay?

16:33.640 --> 16:36.000
To relax a little, enjoy their magic.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.440
One girl in particular really shone.

16:38.520 --> 16:41.120
Ethel Hallow shines in every class.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.680
- Mildred Hubble.
- How nice to hear.

16:43.760 --> 16:44.760
She isn't gifted.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.800
Really?
I heard she located the Founding Stone.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.360
She landed on it. There's a difference.

16:55.600 --> 16:56.600
Miss Cackle.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.200
I'm afraid we have something
of a situation.

17:00.840 --> 17:04.200
I told you I was cursed,
but did anybody listen?

17:04.480 --> 17:05.319
No!

17:05.400 --> 17:07.560
Did the curse tell you to grab the stone?

17:07.640 --> 17:09.880
I was trying to stop us from vanishing.

17:09.960 --> 17:13.400
By touching the one thing
that gets us instantly expelled?

17:14.720 --> 17:16.920
Let's just put it back
before anyone notices.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.480
- Who could have taken it?
- I don't know.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.880
But they're going to be in big trouble
when we find them.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.440
Let me get... I just have to... Just...

17:41.640 --> 17:42.640
Stop!

17:47.280 --> 17:49.120
Will you give me the toothpaste?

18:04.560 --> 18:07.560
There must be a way
of putting it back without being caught.

18:08.840 --> 18:09.840
Yeah.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.320
Simple.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.520
Disappear everyone
so there's no one around to see us.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.240
Bingo! Why didn't I think of that?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.800
'Cause we don't have the power
for that kind of spell.

18:21.120 --> 18:24.880
We don't need power. We need fire.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.080
A small magic one,
just to set off the alarm.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.280
Nothing.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
Untraceable.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.280
I'm so sorry, Ada.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.120
No need to panic... yet.

18:51.680 --> 18:55.840
Oh, considering our girls,
it could easily be some sort of prank.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.720
If it was one of our girls.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.320
Who else could it be?

18:59.960 --> 19:02.120
A search of the grounds wouldn't go amiss.

19:06.080 --> 19:10.200
No one else hears of this.
Not until we know more.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.480
Earth, hear me.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.400
Air, hear me.

19:43.040 --> 19:45.000
Fire, hear me.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.880
Why hasn't it set off the alarm?

20:31.240 --> 20:32.720
It's not making any smoke.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.800
But we need everyone to evacuate.

20:36.520 --> 20:37.560
Why did it do that?

20:41.360 --> 20:43.920
It says "one firefly."

20:44.000 --> 20:45.600
Yep. One jar.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.520
No, one fly only.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.520
More than that can cause...

20:52.960 --> 20:54.040
Real fire!

21:03.520 --> 21:06.200
Not another drill!

21:10.400 --> 21:12.640
Try not to drown anyone this time.

21:17.320 --> 21:20.080
- Sybil, let's go now!
- I can't move!

21:21.920 --> 21:22.920
Come on!

21:24.000 --> 21:26.440
- We have to get help.
- I can't.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.840
We'll get Miss Cackle!

21:36.960 --> 21:40.160
The smoke's not purple!
That means it's real, doesn't it?

21:40.240 --> 21:43.120
They want us to think it's real.
HB changed the colour.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.680
- It's coming from there.
- Go in the opposite direction!

21:46.760 --> 21:47.840
Isn't that Sybil's room?

21:51.680 --> 21:53.640
What are you doing?

21:54.960 --> 21:56.800
We were trying to evacuate the school.

21:56.960 --> 21:57.960
Why?

21:58.080 --> 22:00.480
So we could put that back
where it belongs.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.880
Miss Cackle is going to skin you alive.

22:04.200 --> 22:06.240
Sybil, we have to get you out.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.520
I can't. I've tried.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.760
Don't be so ridiculous.

22:10.440 --> 22:11.440
Sybil!

22:11.760 --> 22:12.800
It's okay.

22:13.200 --> 22:14.720
Everyone gets scared sometimes.

22:16.080 --> 22:20.080
You're brave. Deep down.
You just have to find it.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.840
Close your eyes.

22:22.520 --> 22:23.520
Find it.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.680
You're a good witch, Sybil.
You've got nothing to be scared of.

22:33.160 --> 22:35.120
And I can't let you get hurt, too.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.120
We have to be strong, don't we?
For Esme.

22:38.680 --> 22:39.680
Okay?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.160
Okay.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.920
Excellent work, Hecate.
Quite the surprise.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.480
And I especially appreciated

22:58.560 --> 23:01.760
the eerie glow emanating
from that first-year window.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.200
You've surpassed yourself.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.720
Help! Our bedroom's on fire!

23:05.800 --> 23:07.760
Glad to see you're getting
into the spirit,

23:07.840 --> 23:10.320
but we really don't have to be
quite so dramatic.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.640
I didn't organize a drill.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.280
- You didn't?
- I didn't.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.960
As if we haven't got bigger frogs to fry.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.840
This first year is proving
to be quite the handful.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.200
Thanks.

23:47.320 --> 23:49.360
You're friends with Ethel?

23:49.440 --> 23:52.200
All I know is we helped Sybil
and we came apart.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.600
Sorry I freaked out.

24:00.320 --> 24:01.920
We're just happy you're okay.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.560
We did have to tell Miss Cackle
about the fire, though.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.000
We didn't say anything
about the stone.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.560
I think we might be...

24:14.040 --> 24:17.640
in seriously deep trouble.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.800
First-year attempt at a wildfire spell.

24:31.040 --> 24:35.320
Ten. Nil.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.920
They'll learn.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.080
We'll make it safe in the morning.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.880
Please tell me your stone search
went better than mine.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.080
No trace.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.160
It'll turn up.

24:48.760 --> 24:49.760
You think?

24:50.840 --> 24:51.840
It has to.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.800
Without the stone,
there is no school.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.840
So many scary things were happening.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.600
It all got a bit on top of me.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.080
We do understand, Sybil,
especially with your family problems.

25:15.360 --> 25:21.200
I thought if I did some extra homework,
I'd make up for missing Spell Science.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.760
But I used too many fireflies.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.880
And, well, you know the rest.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.320
The three of you put the entire school
in grave danger.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.920
Your cats will be confiscated,
effective immediately.

25:38.680 --> 25:40.280
Sybil, we'll talk tomorrow.

25:40.760 --> 25:43.040
See if we can't get you fully settled in.

25:43.880 --> 25:44.880
You may go.

25:46.520 --> 25:48.720
Miss Drill will find you
somewhere to sleep.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.160
I should have known she was so afraid.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.160
How could you? She's a Hallow.

25:54.240 --> 25:56.480
Yet completely unlike her sisters.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.560
I'm sure there's a capable witch
underneath.

25:59.760 --> 26:03.680
Speaking of Hallows...
dare I ask how Ethel got on with Mildred?

26:03.840 --> 26:05.640
Separated.

26:05.720 --> 26:07.640
Good news amongst the chaos.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.040
You were great with my sister.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.320
- Thanks.
- You helped, too.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.840
We aren't friends, though.
Nothing's changed.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.640
Thanks for clearing that up.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.000
They haven't sent you home?

26:30.760 --> 26:34.560
I wasn't expelled.
I kind of didn't mention the stone.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.720
And they haven't found it?

26:37.640 --> 26:39.120
It's still in my room.

26:39.200 --> 26:41.360
- Only, they've locked the door.
- Sybil!

26:41.840 --> 26:44.240
The Hallow name will be slime
if this gets out!

26:44.800 --> 26:48.200
I thought maybe you could help me get in
and put it back?

26:48.280 --> 26:50.960
You made a mistake, a huge one.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.200
No one should fix it but you.

27:01.560 --> 27:03.160
I didn't want to take it.

27:03.760 --> 27:06.560
It was an accident that snowballed.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.320
Well, fireballed.

27:09.400 --> 27:11.280
I know how that feels.

27:13.600 --> 27:14.720
I'll help.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.320
If you like.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.200
Really?

27:20.120 --> 27:21.120
Why?

27:22.040 --> 27:24.800
Let's just say I've made
my fair share of mistakes.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.240
You can't always fix them
without a friend.
