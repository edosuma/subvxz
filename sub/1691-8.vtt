00:23.198 --> 00:25.198
Hey, Gene.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.416
Thanks, Jimmy.

00:26.451 --> 00:29.085
- Trina.
- Hey, Jimmy.

00:29.121 --> 00:31.955
Got a package, Dan.

00:36.428 --> 00:38.378
How's it going?

00:38.430 --> 00:40.380
What's up?

01:03.739 --> 01:06.706
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

01:06.742 --> 01:09.576
Jimmy, I'm really slammed.
Just tell me what you need.

01:11.163 --> 01:13.496
What is it?

01:17.586 --> 01:20.720
I can't open it.

01:42.494 --> 01:45.779
So, what does it say?

01:53.288 --> 01:54.587
I must call to your attention

01:54.623 --> 01:56.256
the newly passed Environmental Impact

01:56.291 --> 01:58.925
and Sustainability Assurance Act,

01:58.961 --> 02:00.927
a statute that, as you
know, went into effect

02:00.963 --> 02:03.930
without any ex post
facto provisions in place.

02:03.966 --> 02:05.265
You got a second, Chuck?

02:05.300 --> 02:06.433
Um, not really. I'm I'm kind of...

02:06.468 --> 02:08.101
It'll just take two seconds. I promise.

02:08.136 --> 02:09.102
All right.

02:11.473 --> 02:13.306
What's this?

02:16.311 --> 02:18.611
Is this a joke?

02:18.647 --> 02:21.281
No. No joke.

02:21.316 --> 02:23.950
You... you passed the bar?

02:23.986 --> 02:26.786
Yeah. I did.

02:26.822 --> 02:30.123
I... I thought if Kim could do
it, maybe I can, too, you know?

02:30.158 --> 02:32.959
So I got my last few credits for undergrad

02:32.995 --> 02:34.294
from a community college.

02:34.329 --> 02:35.578
I mean, they're not just for draft Dodgers

02:35.630 --> 02:36.713
and yoga classes, all right?

02:36.748 --> 02:40.166
Then I found a law school
that would accept me.

02:40.218 --> 02:42.502
You know, wasn't Georgetown
or anything, but...

02:42.554 --> 02:46.172
The University of American Samoa.

02:46.224 --> 02:47.841
Oh. Correspondence school.

02:47.893 --> 02:49.509
Well, I wasn't gonna quit work, right?

02:49.561 --> 02:52.679
Day... nights, weekends, you know?

02:52.731 --> 02:55.348
They call it "distance learning" nowadays.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.852
But they're accredited. Go, land crabs.

02:58.904 --> 03:00.353
So, you know, I did that.

03:00.405 --> 03:02.522
And, um, the bar exam's a mother.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.024
I mean, for me it was.

03:04.026 --> 03:06.026
I failed it the first two times,

03:06.028 --> 03:08.661
but I guess it's like
losing your virginity...

03:08.697 --> 03:09.829
third time's the charm.

03:09.865 --> 03:12.999
How... this must have taken you years.

03:13.035 --> 03:15.668
And you kept it a secret all this time.

03:15.704 --> 03:18.838
Why? You didn't come to me for help?

03:18.874 --> 03:21.174
Jesus, Chuck, you're
the busiest guy I know.

03:21.209 --> 03:23.543
I mean, you're doing important shit.

03:23.595 --> 03:26.546
Wow!

03:26.598 --> 03:28.214
I don't know what to say.

03:28.266 --> 03:30.884
Well, are you proud of me?

03:30.936 --> 03:33.887
Hmm? Oh... Yes!

03:33.889 --> 03:36.222
- Absolutely.
- Thanks.

03:36.224 --> 03:40.226
Chuck, that means a lot.

03:40.228 --> 03:41.461
Oh, hey.

03:41.496 --> 03:45.115
I was hoping, you know, if
you think it's appropriate,

03:45.150 --> 03:48.451
um, once I get sworn in and everything...

03:48.487 --> 03:50.737
Consider hiring me?

03:50.789 --> 03:52.572
As what?

03:52.624 --> 03:54.457
Oh. A... a lawyer.

03:54.493 --> 03:55.959
Obviously. Yeah.

03:55.994 --> 03:58.795
Well, that's a question
I'm gonna have to take up

03:58.830 --> 04:00.246
with Howard and the other partners.

04:00.248 --> 04:04.751
Uh, you know, it's not my decision alone.

04:04.753 --> 04:08.088
But how could they say no?

04:08.140 --> 04:09.639
So much drive.

04:09.674 --> 04:12.642
Jimmy, look what you've done here.

04:14.970 --> 04:16.813
- _
- Oh, yeah! Whoo!

04:16.848 --> 04:18.314
- Oh, man. I told those guys devil's food.
- All right, all right!

04:18.350 --> 04:20.149
Yeah. Well, I will sue the store for you.

04:20.185 --> 04:22.652
Good. Just remember us when
you're all big-time, huh?

04:22.687 --> 04:24.320
I don't remember you now, Burt.

04:24.356 --> 04:25.655
You're representing mail room,

04:25.690 --> 04:27.991
so you show those upstairs
jackholes how it gets...

04:28.026 --> 04:29.659
Hey.

04:29.694 --> 04:31.661
What are you folks up to? Having a party?

04:31.696 --> 04:33.997
Just a little celebration

04:34.032 --> 04:35.999
on behalf of New Mexico's newest attorney.

04:36.034 --> 04:39.002
I heard. Jesus, Jimmy, you're
a regular Charlie Hustle.

04:39.037 --> 04:41.004
- Congratulations, my friend.
- Oh, thank you. Thanks.

04:41.039 --> 04:42.338
Uh, would you like some cake?

04:42.374 --> 04:44.674
Oh, here. Uh, don't mind if I do.

04:44.709 --> 04:47.343
Really, really impressive, Jimmy.

04:47.379 --> 04:50.680
We're all proud of you.
Hey, I hate to interrupt.

04:50.715 --> 04:52.682
But could you guys give
Jimmy and me a moment?

04:52.717 --> 04:54.717
- Sure.
- Yeah, absolutely.

04:59.941 --> 05:02.392
Please, sit down.

05:39.598 --> 05:42.065
Uh, let's reassess in six months.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.400
Thanks for understanding, Jimmy.

05:44.436 --> 05:46.903
Uh, you want the door open or closed?

05:46.938 --> 05:48.404
Closed.

06:19.610 --> 06:24.610

06:28.211 --> 06:29.511
_

06:30.749 --> 06:32.532
How's it going?

06:32.585 --> 06:34.368
Uh, settling back in.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.203
Great.

06:36.255 --> 06:39.206
So, apparently, they are ready for us.

06:39.258 --> 06:42.209
Oh, thanks, but I want to
get a couple things done

06:42.261 --> 06:44.094
before lunch, and I'm
still trying to settle...

06:44.129 --> 06:46.713
Come on, Kim. You deserve this.

06:47.883 --> 06:50.550
Come bask in the glow.

06:53.722 --> 06:55.272
Thank you all for coming.

06:55.307 --> 06:58.275
I appreciate you making time
in the middle of your busy days.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.444
I'm pleased to announce
that working closely

07:00.479 --> 07:02.779
with the Bernalillo County
district attorney's office,

07:02.815 --> 07:04.281
we have reached a plea agreement

07:04.316 --> 07:06.617
for former treasurer Craig Kettleman.

07:06.652 --> 07:09.453
We believe this is a just and fair outcome

07:09.488 --> 07:10.704
and brings to a close

07:10.739 --> 07:13.573
an incident Mr. Kettleman deeply regrets.

07:13.575 --> 07:15.242
He is committed to making
amends for his mistakes...

07:15.244 --> 07:16.576
Can I help you?

07:16.578 --> 07:18.578
Yeah, I'm here to see Mrs. Landry.

07:18.580 --> 07:19.713
Oh.

07:19.748 --> 07:23.717
Sign in right here, please.

07:23.752 --> 07:25.085
Are you a relative?

07:25.137 --> 07:26.970
Lawyer.

07:28.007 --> 07:29.973
But I treat my clients like family.

07:30.009 --> 07:32.809
Oh. Uh, y... you know where to find her?

07:32.845 --> 07:36.229
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Ah.

07:38.267 --> 07:39.900
Hey.

07:39.935 --> 07:42.069
Good morning, folks. Hi.

07:42.104 --> 07:44.438
Jimmy McGill. I... oh.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.108
Hey, pick a card, any card.

07:48.110 --> 07:51.611
All right. How's it going there?

07:51.664 --> 07:53.280
Good. Whoa! Not so t...

07:53.282 --> 07:56.750
Oh. Shh.

07:56.785 --> 07:59.419
Little surprise from the card fairy.

08:01.457 --> 08:03.090
Give me back squeeze.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.591
Squeeze whatever you got
that's below the water

08:04.626 --> 08:05.926
that I can't see.

08:05.961 --> 08:07.961
Oh, yeah.

08:08.013 --> 08:10.464
All right, Mrs. Landry,
just a few more signatures,

08:10.516 --> 08:13.300
and, uh thy will be done.

08:13.352 --> 08:15.302
Would you like another hydrox?

08:15.354 --> 08:17.304
No, thank you. I'm all hydrox'd out.

08:17.356 --> 08:20.140
Well, please help yourself
if you change your mind.

08:20.192 --> 08:23.276
All right. That one.

08:23.312 --> 08:26.697
Okay. And that one.

08:26.732 --> 08:30.117
And that is it.

08:30.152 --> 08:31.451
What a relief.

08:31.487 --> 08:32.652
I should have done this years ago.

08:32.705 --> 08:35.655
Well, people do tend to put it off.

08:35.707 --> 08:38.158
- Hmm.
- But everybody should have a will.

08:38.210 --> 08:40.327
Please tell your friends.

08:40.379 --> 08:43.996
And that comes to $140.

08:44.049 --> 08:49.503
And I'm happy to take, uh,
cash or a check or, uh... cash.

08:56.512 --> 08:59.346
O... one moment.

09:11.193 --> 09:13.193
Could you write me a check?

09:13.195 --> 09:14.828
Well, it's been so long,

09:14.863 --> 09:18.248
I... I... I really don't know
if I have enough in my account.

09:18.283 --> 09:19.583
I am so sorry.

09:19.618 --> 09:21.084
Thi... this is awful, but...

09:21.120 --> 09:25.756
... All I have is $43.

09:25.791 --> 09:27.374
Okay.

09:27.426 --> 09:28.875
Now, I could ask for an advance.

09:28.927 --> 09:31.178
I... I... I am so sorry.

09:31.213 --> 09:32.345
It's fine.

09:32.381 --> 09:35.015
I... I don't know what
to say. This is awful.

09:35.050 --> 09:40.353
Uh, oh, you could keep the
will until I get my allowance,

09:40.389 --> 09:43.690
and... and that should only
be until the end of next week.

09:43.725 --> 09:46.193
Okay, that's not necessary.
Here's my address.

09:46.228 --> 09:49.529
Just mail it to me when
you've got it, all right?

09:49.565 --> 09:54.701
And why don't we, uh... we'll
just make it an even $120.

09:54.736 --> 09:56.203
All right?

09:56.238 --> 09:59.289
Oh. Oh. Thank you.

09:59.324 --> 10:01.291
You have a nice day.

10:09.802 --> 10:12.419
Excuse me. Allowance?

10:12.471 --> 10:14.421
Your family has you on an allowance?

10:14.473 --> 10:16.973
Oh, no, no. It's... it's my money.

10:17.009 --> 10:19.309
I just get it from Sandpiper Crossing.

10:19.344 --> 10:21.094
$500 a month...

10:21.096 --> 10:22.179
I don't understand.

10:22.231 --> 10:24.014
You should have social security checks...

10:24.066 --> 10:25.682
... Plus that pension we talked about.

10:25.734 --> 10:27.684
So how are you on an allowance?

10:27.736 --> 10:30.020
Well, the checks go to Sandpiper,

10:30.072 --> 10:34.441
and then they take out my
fees and... and my expenses.

10:34.443 --> 10:35.775
Why don't you just come on in?

10:35.777 --> 10:37.777
I'm afraid I'm not explaining it very well.

10:40.282 --> 10:44.417
I... I have statements here... somewhere.

10:44.453 --> 10:46.753
Somewhere. Okay. Here...

10:46.788 --> 10:48.922
So your pension and social security

10:48.957 --> 10:51.591
goes straight to the Sandpiper people?

10:51.627 --> 10:55.595
They take out... they
take out what they need,

10:55.631 --> 10:58.765
and then... and then I get my allowance.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.050
Here.

11:00.102 --> 11:03.386
And... and all the rest
goes into my savings account.

11:03.438 --> 11:05.889
It's really all very above-board.

11:05.941 --> 11:09.059
A lot of places do it this way.

11:09.111 --> 11:11.061
This is how they do it
for everybody around here?

11:11.113 --> 11:15.282
Well, yes, they... they try
to make everything easy for us.

11:18.070 --> 11:21.204
Mrs. Landry, are any of your friends around

11:21.240 --> 11:23.707
who I could talk to?

11:29.831 --> 11:32.165
I see you spent... now, I
don't know if you noticed...

11:32.167 --> 11:35.168
$187.50 on 4-10-12.

11:35.170 --> 11:37.337
Do you know what 4-10-12 is?

11:37.339 --> 11:41.174
No. In order to find out,
you have to look on the back.

11:41.176 --> 11:43.343
Okay? And see this key.

11:43.345 --> 11:46.179
I see you have reading glasses.
Can I borrow your glasses?

11:46.231 --> 11:48.848
Yes. Thank you.

11:48.901 --> 11:50.684
Oh, these are gonna help me,

11:50.736 --> 11:52.686
but I don't know if they'll do the trick.

11:52.738 --> 11:55.355
So tiny.

11:55.357 --> 11:58.074
4-10-12...

11:58.110 --> 12:01.661
I think it might be Q-tips. I can't tell.

12:01.697 --> 12:03.613
It's probably an accident,
but we should look into it.

12:03.665 --> 12:04.698
don't you think?

12:04.700 --> 12:06.366
They're not doing this intentionally.

12:06.368 --> 12:08.201
Okay? This could be a mistake.

12:08.203 --> 12:10.370
But if we correct the mistake,

12:10.372 --> 12:13.757
then you'll get some money
back, and it'll be fair.

12:14.793 --> 12:16.293
Hey, Chuck.

12:18.463 --> 12:21.765
My boxes, the ones I left...

12:21.800 --> 12:23.300
Oh.

12:29.608 --> 12:31.558
Sandpiper Crossing...

12:31.610 --> 12:33.727
Sandpiper Crossing...

12:33.779 --> 12:35.562
Did you do my wills?

12:35.614 --> 12:36.563
Yes, I did.

12:36.615 --> 12:38.565
Hey. Would you look at that?

12:38.617 --> 12:40.400
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

12:40.452 --> 12:41.735
This was a one-time thing,

12:41.787 --> 12:44.904
and don't think I don't see
what you were doing here.

12:44.957 --> 12:48.241
You wanted to play Tom Sawyer,
wanted me to paint the fence,

12:48.293 --> 12:50.910
and god help me, it worked.

12:50.963 --> 12:52.245
You need help?

12:52.297 --> 12:54.798
Hire a paralegal, stand
on your own two feet.

12:54.833 --> 12:57.133
Yeah. Sure. I'll do that.

12:57.169 --> 12:58.752
You're not even listening to me.

12:58.754 --> 13:00.920
No, I... I hear you, Chuck, okay?

13:00.922 --> 13:04.090
Self-reliance. It's great
stuff. Would you look at this?

13:04.092 --> 13:05.425
What did I just say?

13:05.427 --> 13:08.762
Ta... take a look, okay? Just right here.

13:08.764 --> 13:11.264
Do you see what I see?

13:11.266 --> 13:13.433
All I'm asking is for you
to take a look. Please?

13:13.435 --> 13:15.769
"Sandpiper Crossing... "

13:15.771 --> 13:17.937
It's a retirement home, assisted living.

13:17.939 --> 13:20.106
It's... this is one of
their monthly invoices

13:20.108 --> 13:21.107
they send their residents.

13:21.109 --> 13:22.942
What exactly am I looking for?

13:22.944 --> 13:24.027
It's nothing earth-shaking.

13:24.079 --> 13:25.862
Just little things, little things like...

13:25.914 --> 13:27.864
like this right here.

13:27.916 --> 13:31.951
$14 for code 118-62. What's 118-62?

13:32.004 --> 13:33.953
I wonder.

13:36.008 --> 13:40.343
How could you even read
this? It's like microfilm.

13:47.019 --> 13:52.806
118-62 is facial tissue.

13:52.858 --> 13:54.808
14 bucks for a box of Kleenex.

13:54.860 --> 13:56.109
Yeah, I found others.

13:56.144 --> 13:58.778
There's $3.50 for a single
roll of toilet paper,

13:58.814 --> 14:00.780
22 bucks for a bottle of aspirin.

14:00.816 --> 14:03.483
It's a clear pattern of overcharging.

14:03.535 --> 14:05.652
Nothing huge, but it adds up to real money.

14:05.704 --> 14:07.320
I mean, here, look.

14:07.372 --> 14:10.990
This woman... she got soaked
for like 400 bucks last month.

14:11.043 --> 14:12.325
And there's a pretty solid attempt

14:12.377 --> 14:13.993
at concealment of that fact,

14:14.046 --> 14:16.996
which to my way of thinking, makes it...

14:17.049 --> 14:21.835
Fraud. This was in work I did?

14:21.887 --> 14:23.336
Yeah, you must have missed it.

14:23.338 --> 14:28.842
Um, look, Chuck, I got lucky, right?

14:28.844 --> 14:30.226
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.

14:30.262 --> 14:32.562
And this is no mom-and-pop outfit, okay?

14:32.597 --> 14:33.930
I dug around a little.

14:33.982 --> 14:36.099
They're owned by some kind of
real-estate investment trust.

14:36.151 --> 14:39.769
I'm working at getting more
info, but this could be big.

14:39.821 --> 14:41.771
I mean, this could be a big case, right?

14:41.823 --> 14:45.442
Well... if it's more
than a few errant billings

14:45.494 --> 14:49.779
and if it's systematic and
you establish a pattern,

14:49.831 --> 14:53.616
it could be class-action.

14:53.668 --> 14:55.618
What do I do now? I mean, what next?

14:55.670 --> 14:57.454
Well, you're gonna need more information.

14:57.506 --> 14:59.205
You don't want to go off half-cocked.

14:59.207 --> 15:01.708
Full cock. Okay.

15:01.710 --> 15:03.710
No, I... I'm gonna head back there.

15:03.712 --> 15:06.880
Thank you. You're the best.

15:18.894 --> 15:22.028
Back to see Mrs. Landry.

15:24.733 --> 15:27.400
Okay. What gives?

15:27.402 --> 15:29.736
Sorry, sir. New policy.

15:29.738 --> 15:32.906
We're concerned about
solicitation on premises.

15:32.908 --> 15:36.042
I'm not a gigolo, if
that's what you're implying.

15:36.077 --> 15:38.128
Legal solicitation.

15:38.163 --> 15:42.549
We are obligated to protect our
residents from being harassed,

15:42.584 --> 15:44.217
and we have the right to refuse entry.

15:45.587 --> 15:47.387
I have clients in there.

15:47.422 --> 15:49.389
Now, they have the legal
right to meet with me.

15:49.424 --> 15:53.092
Well, you'll just have to
arrange to meet them elsewhere.

15:56.681 --> 15:58.815
Oh, come on, guys. Seriously?

15:58.850 --> 16:00.934
What, are you making
soylent green back there?

16:00.936 --> 16:03.269
It's... all right, okay.

16:03.271 --> 16:06.606
I... I'm backing away. Yeah?

16:10.111 --> 16:13.580
You know what? Uh... This...

16:13.615 --> 16:16.249
Hey, this has gotten me a
little bit stirred up down there.

16:16.284 --> 16:17.917
Can I use your restroom?

16:17.953 --> 16:20.670
Please, it's... I've got I.B.S.

16:20.705 --> 16:22.172
Go ahead.

16:49.201 --> 16:52.151
"To Sandpiper Crossing...

16:52.204 --> 16:54.320
... clients of James M. McGill...

16:54.372 --> 16:56.573
This is to inform you to stay...

16:56.625 --> 16:58.741
Sir? Are you all right in there?

16:58.793 --> 17:00.827
"We believe that... breach of contract... "

17:03.665 --> 17:05.330
Come on, now, sir. I've been very patient.

17:05.383 --> 17:08.334
"... clear pattern of malfeasance...

17:08.386 --> 17:10.303
This is a negligent infliction
of emotional distress."

17:10.338 --> 17:12.505
Sir, I really need you to
finish up and come out now.

17:12.507 --> 17:13.506
"... contact by the end of the week

17:13.558 --> 17:15.391
or I will be forced to move forward."

17:15.426 --> 17:18.228
- Sir, I need you to finish up...
- This is a demand letter informing Sandpiper Crossing

17:18.262 --> 17:19.646
of pending litigation

17:19.681 --> 17:21.848
for defrauding my clients
through systematic overcharging.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.851
You're shredding in there! I'm not deaf!

17:24.853 --> 17:25.984
I can hear you! Stop right now!

17:27.771 --> 17:29.022
This here... this makes it official, right?

17:29.024 --> 17:30.356
If you don't stop shredding right now,

17:30.358 --> 17:32.859
that's destruction of
evidence... spoliation!

17:32.861 --> 17:34.577
That's what it's called, and it's a felony!

17:34.613 --> 17:37.580
So call your lawyers right now
and tell them I said that...

17:37.616 --> 17:39.365
me... James McGill esquire!

17:41.286 --> 17:43.586
I'm telling you guys, big mistake! Aah!

18:04.717 --> 18:07.334
Hey.

18:07.386 --> 18:08.836
Hey.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.671
Am I calling at a bad time?

18:10.673 --> 18:12.139
No, not at all.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.474
How you doing?

18:13.509 --> 18:16.226
Uh, pretty good. Getting by.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.728
How about you?

18:17.763 --> 18:19.847
Getting by.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.849
It's good to hear from you.

18:21.901 --> 18:25.352
Yeah. I... I've been...
there's been a lot going on.

18:25.404 --> 18:26.687
You know how it is.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.856
Yeah, I know.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.023
Uh, listen.

18:30.076 --> 18:33.360
I was... was hoping maybe
you could do me a favor.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.662
Do you think you could watch Kaylee?

18:35.698 --> 18:38.999
It'd be during my shift
the day after tomorrow.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.835
Look, I hate to ask, but
my regular sitter's down...

18:41.871 --> 18:45.172
anything you need, I'll be there.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.674
You can get off work? I don't
want to impose or anything.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.544
No. Anytime.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.018
It's not an imposition.

18:58.053 --> 19:02.189
Thanks. Appreciate it.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.358
Yeah, no problem.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.026
At a quarter to 2:00?

19:06.061 --> 19:08.112
I'll see you then.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.115
Okay.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.705
Ohh! Jesus!

20:21.136 --> 20:23.604
Aah.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.638
Come on.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.975
Where is it?

21:02.011 --> 21:03.143
Oh.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.678
Oh!

21:04.680 --> 21:09.349
Oh! God damn it!

21:15.274 --> 21:16.406
And it didn't even make it fit.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.360
And I'm like, "it's not like
we're close to being done."

21:20.362 --> 21:22.696
I mean, can't you get
somebody else to do it?"

21:22.698 --> 21:23.864
Right.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.999
They don't pay any of
us enough for this shit.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.584
You know what? And it's
going on and on and on.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.369
And so I'm like,

21:29.371 --> 21:32.706
"why are you making your
problems my problems?"

21:32.708 --> 21:35.375
Right. Like you don't have
enough problems of your own.

21:35.427 --> 21:37.044
Exactly! That's exactly what I'm saying.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.379
Thank you. But he just...

21:49.775 --> 21:51.725
James McGill.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.060
Mr. McGill,

21:53.112 --> 21:55.028
Rich Schweikart of Schweikart and Cokely.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.364
We're the law firm representing
Sandpiper Crossing assisted living.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.699
How are you this evening?

21:58.734 --> 22:01.368
Quite well, thank you. How are you?

22:01.403 --> 22:03.570
Doing fine. Doing fine.

22:03.622 --> 22:06.123
I'm sorry to call so late.
Did I catch you at a bad time?

22:06.158 --> 22:08.125
No, no. No, it's fine.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.127
It's just that you're whispering.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.629
I'm at the opera.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.632
Oh. What opera?

22:15.668 --> 22:16.967
"Magic Flute."

22:17.002 --> 22:18.552
Mozart! Lovely.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.387
Well, I'll try not to keep you.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.890
We received... something from you today,

22:23.926 --> 22:25.726
and we're not quite sure what.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.594
It's a demand letter.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.262
Ah.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.431
Well, it was a little confusing
'cause it was written on, uh...

22:31.483 --> 22:33.600
Well, I had to write it quickly

22:33.652 --> 22:36.937
because your clients were in the
process of destroying evidence.

22:36.989 --> 22:40.440
Mr. McGill, if you're talking
about shredding documents,

22:40.492 --> 22:42.743
that's neither irregular nor illegal.

22:42.778 --> 22:44.411
Every business in America does it.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.246
You say potato, I say spoliation.

22:46.281 --> 22:47.614
Mm-hmm.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.750
Maybe you should walk me through
what you're alleging here.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.752
I believe it's all in the letter.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.420
Uh, uh, I... I'm not saying it's not,

22:53.455 --> 22:56.289
but it's a bit hard to read.

22:56.291 --> 22:58.425
Next time, I'd use double-ply.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.427
Let's not fixate on the medium, okay?

23:00.462 --> 23:02.429
Let's look at the message.

23:02.464 --> 23:06.933
Now, your clients are facing
multiple counts of elder abuse

23:06.969 --> 23:10.354
and... and fraud and deceptive
and unfair trade practices,

23:10.389 --> 23:13.190
and that's just the start, okay?

23:13.225 --> 23:15.859
I'm not a betting man, but I
bet the farm I'll find more.

23:15.894 --> 23:19.029
Mr. McGill, are you
related to Charles McGill?

23:19.064 --> 23:21.031
He's my brother.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.283
Yeah? How's he doing these days?

23:23.318 --> 23:27.954
I... I fail to see the relevance of this.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.373
Frankly, the only reason
that I made this phone call

23:29.408 --> 23:31.041
was out of respect for Charles

23:31.076 --> 23:32.876
on the off chance that you
might be related to him.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.661
My partner suggested that the best response

23:34.663 --> 23:37.330
would be to send a rule 11
letter and have you sanctioned,

23:37.332 --> 23:39.166
but I didn't want to jump
to that immediate length.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.501
Hey, how about you stop
trying to rattle my cage

23:41.503 --> 23:44.221
and just, you know, respond to the merits?

23:44.256 --> 23:45.639
This is my response, Mr. McGill...

23:45.674 --> 23:48.308
you have no good-faith basis
to threaten any litigation.

23:48.343 --> 23:51.311
This is a shakedown, and we both know it.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.981
Now, if you push this any
further, my hands will be tied.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.817
Sorry for interrupting your evening.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.318
Enjoy "The Magic Flute."

23:59.354 --> 24:02.739
Blow my magic flute.

24:12.367 --> 24:14.701
Aah!

24:19.425 --> 24:23.677
Son of a bitch!

26:08.200 --> 26:10.650
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

26:10.702 --> 26:13.320
Oh, uh, Chuck, um...

26:13.372 --> 26:15.655
Sorry to... show up like this.

26:15.707 --> 26:17.991
I just needed space to work.

26:18.043 --> 26:19.826
What is all this?

26:19.878 --> 26:21.328
What have you done to my dining room?

26:21.380 --> 26:23.830
They were spoliating, the Sandpiper people.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.165
They wouldn't let me in,

26:25.217 --> 26:26.633
and I could see that they were shredding.

26:26.668 --> 26:28.668
I wrote them a demand
letter, and I gave it to them.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.004
- You broke in to a nursing home?
- Assisted living.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.389
And you stole their garbage.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.058
My god. No, it was in public.
There was no lock, no nothing.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.677
I just lifted the lid, and there it was.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.346
There's no reasonable
expectation of privacy

26:39.348 --> 26:41.014
in that situation, is there?

26:41.016 --> 26:44.517
You can't say it's private if
a hobo can use it as a wigwam.

26:44.519 --> 26:46.186
That's... that's the standard, right?

26:46.188 --> 26:48.188
If animals or vagrants can get in?

26:49.741 --> 26:51.024
More or less, yes.

26:51.076 --> 26:53.860
Okay, so this is all legal.

26:53.912 --> 26:56.363
I mean, it's completely
above-the-belt legal.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.499
I just need to figure out what
they're trying to cover up.

26:59.534 --> 27:01.034
You know, you don't shred like this

27:01.086 --> 27:03.003
unless you got something
to hide, am I right?

27:03.038 --> 27:04.537
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, come on, Chuck.

27:04.590 --> 27:05.872
A lawyer shows up,

27:05.874 --> 27:08.875
starts figuring out their
little scheme, and suddenly this?

27:08.877 --> 27:11.428
No, it's not a coincidence. It's in here.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.598
Well, at least it's not crosscut.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.766
Look, you won't even know I'm here, okay?

27:16.802 --> 27:19.102
I just need some space and some quiet,

27:19.137 --> 27:20.937
and I'll be out of your
hair as soon as I c...

27:20.973 --> 27:23.440
Stop, stop. It's okay. You can work here.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.891
Thanks.

27:24.943 --> 27:28.395
I don't mind the company.

27:28.447 --> 27:31.398
You look like you could
use a cup of coffee.

27:31.450 --> 27:34.567
Good god, yes.

27:34.620 --> 27:36.286
I'll put it on.

28:16.445 --> 28:19.579
Up, up. Up.

28:19.614 --> 28:22.916
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

28:24.786 --> 28:27.587
God's sweet sake.

28:49.978 --> 28:52.145
Yeah.

29:13.233 --> 29:16.018
Oh, good. You're up.

29:17.271 --> 29:21.573
Well, Jesus, Chuck, how
long have I been asleep?

29:21.608 --> 29:23.608
Chuck, how did you... ?

29:25.529 --> 29:27.529
I... I can't believe this. Uh...

29:29.083 --> 29:32.034
Uh, thank you. This is a huge help.

29:32.086 --> 29:35.037
I felt like I was shoveling
snow in a blizzard.

29:35.089 --> 29:37.539
Well, it gets better.

29:37.591 --> 29:39.374
What's this?

29:39.426 --> 29:41.376
It's your smoking gun.

29:41.428 --> 29:44.212
It's a, uh... invoice for syringes.

29:44.264 --> 29:45.881
Yes. From?

29:45.933 --> 29:49.217
Morrissey Medical Supply Lincoln, Nebraska.

29:49.269 --> 29:52.054
- So?
- Trust me.

29:52.106 --> 29:54.723
Meanwhile, we need to
start pulling case law...

29:54.775 --> 30:00.062
any precedent dealing
with 18 U.S.C. 1961 to '68.

30:00.114 --> 30:03.065
Probably not a bad idea to pull 30.47.1

30:03.117 --> 30:06.735
from NMSA... Uh, 1978.

30:06.787 --> 30:09.237
I don't think that's gonna play, really,

30:09.289 --> 30:12.541
but it's a good opening salvo for us.

30:12.576 --> 30:15.043
Wait, "us"?

30:15.079 --> 30:16.878
We're working together on this?

30:16.914 --> 30:20.549
Mm. That's up to you, Jimmy.

30:20.584 --> 30:23.385
'Cause...

30:23.420 --> 30:25.053
Well...

30:25.089 --> 30:27.389
All right.

30:27.424 --> 30:30.926
All right. All right. Let's get to work.

30:47.494 --> 30:49.778
- Kim Wexler.
- Hey, gorgeous.

30:49.830 --> 30:52.781
Oh, man. Sweet-talking
right out of the gate?

30:52.833 --> 30:54.950
You want something. Make it fast.

30:55.002 --> 30:56.618
- I want to go home.
- Okay, okay.

30:56.670 --> 30:59.121
Will you look something
up for me on Westlaw?

30:59.173 --> 31:00.956
Please?

31:01.008 --> 31:02.958
You're lucky I'm a pushover.

31:03.010 --> 31:04.793
All right. Hit me.

31:04.845 --> 31:06.011
Thank you.

31:06.046 --> 31:09.631
Uh, anything on Sedima v. Imrex,

31:09.633 --> 31:11.800
Slesinger v. Disney, Holmes v. S.I.P.C...

31:11.802 --> 31:14.469
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow
down, slow down. V. Disney.

31:14.521 --> 31:17.139
Holmes v. S.I...

31:17.141 --> 31:18.306
D.C., yeah.

31:18.358 --> 31:23.645
And, uh, anything on
57.12.1-24 NMSA, 1978.

31:23.697 --> 31:25.147
Uh, okay.

31:25.199 --> 31:27.482
It would help if I knew what
you were looking for here.

31:27.534 --> 31:28.984
Anything, everything.

31:29.036 --> 31:30.819
What? You want me to just read
you the head notes or something?

31:30.871 --> 31:32.821
No, no, print it... full cases,

31:32.873 --> 31:34.656
and any cases that cite to those cases.

31:34.658 --> 31:37.709
Shepardize like the wolf's at the door.

31:37.744 --> 31:39.878
Jesus, Jimmy, that's gonna
be thousands of pages.

31:39.913 --> 31:41.880
Pretty please with sugar on top?

31:41.915 --> 31:43.882
Come on. You owe me one.

31:43.917 --> 31:47.002
Yes, I do, but this is gonna take hours.

31:47.004 --> 31:49.221
- And who do I bill it to?
- Bill it to Howard.

31:49.256 --> 31:50.555
I still remember his code...

31:50.591 --> 31:53.225
1933, same year Hitler came to power.

31:53.260 --> 31:56.228
You're not funny. I'm
not billing it to my boss.

31:56.263 --> 31:58.230
How about yours? I'll pay you back.

31:58.265 --> 32:01.233
Jimmy, this is 300, 400
bucks worth of printing.

32:01.268 --> 32:02.734
The accountants will find
it and I'll get fired,

32:02.769 --> 32:05.020
which sounds fun and all, but no.

32:05.072 --> 32:07.405
Okay. Hold on a sec.

32:10.694 --> 32:12.077
Hey.

32:12.112 --> 32:13.912
Uh, Kim can't print without a code.

32:13.947 --> 32:15.747
Should I go over there,
take notes, and come back?

32:15.782 --> 32:16.770
No, no, no. It would take too long.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.417
Use mine... 1868.

32:19.453 --> 32:22.204
Yeah.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.775
1868. Use that. It's Chuck's.

32:26.777 --> 32:28.276
You're using Chuck's number?

32:28.278 --> 32:30.078
Does Chuck know you're
using Chuck's number?

32:30.114 --> 32:31.329
We're working on something together.

32:31.365 --> 32:32.781
And bring it over to his place after.

32:32.833 --> 32:34.583
- You're a lifesaver.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

32:34.618 --> 32:36.284
You're working a case together?

32:36.286 --> 32:39.121
Yeah. Keep this under your
hat, but it's gonna be huge...

32:39.123 --> 32:41.123
maybe a class-action, even.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.292
We think it'll settle for
$1 million, maybe $2 million.

32:44.294 --> 32:46.511
How does that work?

32:46.547 --> 32:48.346
- Chuck's a partner at HHM.
- So what?

32:48.382 --> 32:51.016
Look, I know Chuck's partnership
agreement chapter and verse.

32:51.051 --> 32:52.684
He can work with outside parties.

32:52.719 --> 32:55.187
That clause is intended
for small-time stuff,

32:55.222 --> 32:56.188
pro bono cases.

32:56.223 --> 32:57.856
So? I'm bono. I'm very bono.

32:57.891 --> 33:00.192
Chuck's a rock star,
okay? They'll work it out.

33:00.227 --> 33:03.195
And Chuck can handle this?
Last time I saw him, he was...

33:03.230 --> 33:05.697
Last time you saw him,
he wasn't himself, okay?

33:05.732 --> 33:07.649
This is good for him.

33:07.651 --> 33:10.952
Okay.

33:10.988 --> 33:12.204
What?

33:12.239 --> 33:13.872
I don't know. I'm just...

33:13.907 --> 33:15.874
Whatever. I'll see you in a couple hours.

33:15.909 --> 33:17.375
Okay. We're ordering a pizza, okay?

33:17.411 --> 33:18.710
I'll save you a slice.

33:37.014 --> 33:39.147
Now, you know, if you don't separate those,

33:39.183 --> 33:40.482
you're gonna end up with brown.

33:42.352 --> 33:43.652
Hello?

33:43.687 --> 33:45.020
Hey.

33:45.022 --> 33:48.356
We're in here.

33:48.358 --> 33:50.525
We're playing sculptor.

33:50.527 --> 33:55.030
She's Michelangelina. How's work?

33:55.032 --> 33:59.034
Eh, you know... work. How did it go?

33:59.036 --> 34:02.704
Kid's a dream. She's easy.

34:02.706 --> 34:04.706
And you better stay that way.

34:07.377 --> 34:09.377
How you doing, sweetie? Huh?

34:09.379 --> 34:11.213
Hmm?

34:11.215 --> 34:13.882
Well, I better be going.

34:13.884 --> 34:15.217
Oh, wait. Hang on a sec, would you?

34:15.219 --> 34:18.520
I want to talk to you about something.

34:18.554 --> 34:20.388
What's up?

34:24.061 --> 34:27.027
I want to know what I should do with this.

34:27.063 --> 34:30.114
I've been carrying it around for weeks,

34:30.150 --> 34:32.449
like holding on to it.

34:32.485 --> 34:35.286
Every place I put it feels wrong.

34:35.322 --> 34:38.039
I thought about putting it in
the collection plate, but...

34:38.074 --> 34:41.909
It seemed... I don't know.

34:41.911 --> 34:44.079
Look, with Matty gone, I have expenses,

34:44.081 --> 34:47.748
and the death benefit helped, but...

34:47.751 --> 34:50.585
What I want to ask you is...

34:50.587 --> 34:53.255
... Can I spend this?

34:53.257 --> 34:58.260
Stace, if this money helps you and Kaylee,

34:58.262 --> 35:00.762
if it does a single
good thing in this world,

35:00.764 --> 35:04.099
then you spend every penny.

35:04.101 --> 35:08.436
That's a relief. It'll help a lot.

35:12.826 --> 35:16.778
Of course, it's only a drop in the bucket.

35:23.287 --> 35:24.553
I swear, everyone I know
has had problems with them.

35:24.605 --> 35:26.221
I had one. The computer in the engine...

35:26.273 --> 35:28.390
it locked in the middle of the Rockies.

35:28.542 --> 35:31.827
Yeah, it decided I was
overheating, and that was it.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.829
Yeah. I couldn't get it
fixed for a hundred miles.

35:33.881 --> 35:35.330
I had to have it towed to Telluride.

35:35.382 --> 35:36.331
It was unbelievable.

35:36.383 --> 35:38.000
Huh.

35:38.132 --> 35:41.917
No, it's... it's the
chip. It's the little...

35:41.969 --> 35:45.420
Yeah, it's like 800 bucks, not counting...

35:45.472 --> 35:46.922
Labor.

35:49.927 --> 35:52.928
Hey, Mel, can I call you back?

36:02.439 --> 36:06.441
Chuck, the Sandpiper has landed.

36:15.619 --> 36:17.252
Gentlemen, I'm Jimmy McGill.

36:17.287 --> 36:18.587
- Welcome.
- Rich Schweikart.

36:18.622 --> 36:20.756
This is Alvin Reese. Phil Jergens.

36:20.791 --> 36:21.923
Thanks for coming.

36:21.959 --> 36:23.792
Oh, whoa. I have to ask you.

36:23.844 --> 36:25.794
Uh, please leave electronics in the car...

36:25.846 --> 36:28.463
laptops, blackberries,
palm pilots, watches.

36:28.515 --> 36:31.183
If you lick it and it
goes bzzt, leave it here.

36:31.218 --> 36:32.684
Why?

36:32.720 --> 36:35.020
My brother Chuck has a certain sensitivity.

36:35.055 --> 36:36.855
It's a medical condition.

36:36.940 --> 36:39.024
This is the price of admission.

36:39.076 --> 36:40.358
Yeah, I heard about this.

36:40.411 --> 36:44.079
Go ahead. It's fine.

36:44.114 --> 36:46.698
Here you go.

36:51.171 --> 36:53.121
Make yourselves comfortable, gentlemen.

36:53.173 --> 36:54.339
I'll be right back.

36:56.543 --> 36:58.543
All right.

37:02.516 --> 37:06.635
Chuck. Come on, buddy.

37:06.687 --> 37:08.970
I...

37:09.022 --> 37:10.806
I don't... I don't know if I can do this.

37:10.858 --> 37:13.308
You... oh, you can do this, all right?

37:13.360 --> 37:15.143
These guys...

37:15.195 --> 37:18.146
Those guys... they're nothing. Okay?

37:18.198 --> 37:20.816
They're the Pistons, and you're the Bulls.

37:20.868 --> 37:22.150
All right?

37:22.202 --> 37:26.655
All you got to do is sit
there and look intimidating.

37:26.707 --> 37:30.325
They're scared of you
already, and they should be.

37:30.377 --> 37:32.994
You're Charles McGill.

37:33.046 --> 37:35.380
Let's go. Let's go get 'em.

37:41.421 --> 37:43.054
Ah.

37:43.090 --> 37:45.006
Hey.

37:45.058 --> 37:46.391
Do you remember me, Charles?

37:46.426 --> 37:49.094
We were on a co-defense...
Church's Donuts v. Amendola?

37:49.096 --> 37:50.428
Oh.

37:50.430 --> 37:52.097
It was... Jesus 9, 10 years ago.

37:52.099 --> 37:54.099
Yeah.

37:54.151 --> 37:56.234
Oh, our guys were suing the other guys,

37:56.270 --> 37:57.736
and they were suing us right back,

37:57.771 --> 38:00.605
and the city had some
grievance with everyone,

38:00.657 --> 38:02.774
so we had to bundle like
four actions together,

38:02.826 --> 38:04.776
and I was sure that we were sunk.

38:04.828 --> 38:08.113
But you... you quoted... what was it?

38:08.165 --> 38:11.783
Huh? Addyston Pipe & Steel.

38:11.835 --> 38:13.618
You turned it all antitrust,

38:13.620 --> 38:15.287
and the whole thing went
away in summary judgment.

38:15.289 --> 38:16.454
It was amazing. It was amazing.

38:16.456 --> 38:18.623
I figured you'd be arguing

38:18.625 --> 38:21.126
in front of the Supreme Court someday.

38:23.130 --> 38:25.297
Well, it's, uh, good to see you.

38:25.299 --> 38:26.298
Yeah.

38:29.266 --> 38:31.716
All right, well, let's get started.

38:31.768 --> 38:36.054
Um, we've read your revised demand.

38:36.106 --> 38:38.223
It's, uh, quite a laundry
list. Very creative.

38:38.275 --> 38:39.724
Yeah, creative, like the way

38:39.776 --> 38:42.560
your clients have been billing my clients.

38:42.613 --> 38:45.280
'Cause that's like Salvador Dalí creative.

38:45.315 --> 38:47.449
That's cute. Y... you know,
you're not gonna make this stick.

38:47.484 --> 38:49.200
Setting aside evidentiary concerns...

38:49.236 --> 38:52.370
whoa, whoa. Your guys couldn't
afford 10 bucks for a padlock?

38:52.406 --> 38:55.123
That's on them. Public property.

38:55.158 --> 38:58.627
Maybe a judge sees that
your way, maybe he doesn't.

38:58.662 --> 39:00.629
But the damages for elder abuse?

39:00.664 --> 39:04.249
The statute requires proof that
there was some undo influence...

39:04.251 --> 39:07.585
someone threatening the
residents of Sandpiper Crossing.

39:07.638 --> 39:09.587
As far as I understand it, no one
has claimed there's a guy with a knife

39:09.640 --> 39:11.756
telling them to hand
over their lunch money.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.092
There are a lot of
assisted-living facilities

39:14.144 --> 39:15.593
out there that may be disreputable,

39:15.646 --> 39:17.929
but that's not the case with
our client, not even close.

39:17.981 --> 39:19.931
All their facilities all 12 of them...

39:19.983 --> 39:21.933
every single one, five-star rated.

39:21.985 --> 39:23.234
You go to any one of them right now,

39:23.270 --> 39:24.269
and you know what you'll see?

39:24.321 --> 39:26.104
You'll see happy, healthy residents.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.323
Sandpiper takes care of these people.

39:28.358 --> 39:29.574
They don't bilk them.

39:29.609 --> 39:31.576
But we looked into it,

39:31.611 --> 39:35.246
and some of your clients
have, in fact, been overbilled.

39:35.282 --> 39:37.248
It's... it's an accounting error.

39:37.284 --> 39:39.751
It doesn't rise to the level
of fraud, not even close.

39:39.786 --> 39:44.289
We've calculated the damages.
All told, it's $46,320.

39:44.341 --> 39:48.293
Mm-hmm, so here's what
we're prepared to do.

39:48.345 --> 39:50.762
We're gonna make your clients whole...

39:50.797 --> 39:53.515
a check for the $46,000
and change right now.

39:53.550 --> 39:55.684
And on top of that,

39:55.719 --> 39:58.853
we'll give you another
$46k to cover your expenses.

39:58.889 --> 40:00.188
So what's that? $92,000?

40:00.223 --> 40:02.774
Let's call it $100,000 even.

40:02.809 --> 40:05.193
We admit to no wrongdoing,

40:05.228 --> 40:09.397
and your clients release all claims.

40:13.737 --> 40:17.072
I think you're gonna need
to do better than that.

40:19.910 --> 40:22.043
Ah, this was in your demand letter.

40:22.079 --> 40:24.212
They're syringes. So?

40:24.247 --> 40:25.880
I... I don't know if you know this,

40:25.916 --> 40:27.465
but that's a pretty standard item

40:27.501 --> 40:29.000
in an assisted-living facility.

40:29.002 --> 40:31.002
Correct. But it's not
what it is that matters.

40:31.004 --> 40:32.303
It's where it's from.

40:32.339 --> 40:35.507
Lincoln, Nebraska.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.842
Go, cornhuskers.

40:39.679 --> 40:43.348
Well, since you're not picking
up what I'm putting down,

40:43.350 --> 40:45.016
I'll explain it to you.

40:45.018 --> 40:49.521
Um, Nebraska, although they
both begin with the letter "N,"

40:49.523 --> 40:53.825
actually turns out to be a
different state than New Mexico.

40:53.860 --> 40:55.693
So your client accepted shipments

40:55.746 --> 40:59.531
across state lines for its enterprise.

40:59.583 --> 41:03.535
I... in the U.S. mail, no less.

41:03.537 --> 41:06.371
Are you trying to make this a RICO case?

41:06.373 --> 41:08.006
Like our client is John Gotti or something?

41:08.041 --> 41:10.175
Well, you know as well as I do

41:10.210 --> 41:12.510
RICO's used mostly for business beefs.

41:12.546 --> 41:14.846
Sedima establishes a pretty low threshold

41:14.881 --> 41:17.182
for RICO provisions to kick in.

41:17.217 --> 41:20.852
Interstate commerce is a bitch, huh?

41:20.887 --> 41:22.687
As soon as we establish a pattern to...

41:22.722 --> 41:25.356
what was your word? Uh, "overbillings"?

41:25.392 --> 41:28.893
I prefer the classic term of "fraud."

41:28.945 --> 41:31.112
You're looking at treble damages.

41:31.148 --> 41:34.816
So your 100 grand... I think
you know where you can stick it.

41:40.407 --> 41:44.075
Will you give us a moment?

41:53.587 --> 41:57.388
Well...

41:57.424 --> 41:59.390
What number exactly did you have in mind?

41:59.426 --> 42:02.260
$20 million.

42:02.262 --> 42:04.929
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

42:04.981 --> 42:06.264
Oh, you can't expect...

42:06.316 --> 42:10.151
$20 million.

42:10.187 --> 42:13.321
Or we'll see you in court.

42:22.449 --> 42:23.781
Hmm.

42:26.203 --> 42:27.836
$20 million?

42:27.871 --> 42:29.087
Didn't you hear them?

42:29.122 --> 42:33.091
This is a big company.
12 separate facilities.

42:33.126 --> 42:35.593
They can't possibly all be in New Mexico.

42:35.629 --> 42:38.096
This is potentially a multi-state

42:38.131 --> 42:39.514
federal class-action lawsuit

42:39.549 --> 42:41.432
with a RICO kicker at the penalty phase.

42:41.468 --> 42:43.601
$20 million? That's conservative.

42:43.637 --> 42:47.605
Now, class cert... that's where we start.

42:47.641 --> 42:49.858
I'll draft our complaint, try
to get us a conditional one.

42:49.893 --> 42:51.109
They'll try to pierce it,

42:51.144 --> 42:53.778
but it should hold long
enough to start discovery.

42:53.813 --> 42:55.613
And we need to get you back on the grounds,

42:55.649 --> 42:58.116
quash this prohibition against you.

42:58.151 --> 43:02.036
Uh, some injunctive relief. Maybe a T.R.O.

43:03.990 --> 43:05.823
Jimmy?

43:05.825 --> 43:07.825
Do you want to get started on the T.R.O.?

43:07.827 --> 43:09.127
Yeah. Yes.

43:35.188 --> 43:38.823
It looks good. No heartworm, no mange.

43:38.858 --> 43:42.493
- Where did you get her?
- Shelter.

43:42.529 --> 43:45.997
Good. There's too many
puppy mills out there.

43:46.032 --> 43:48.166
I had a dachsie in the other day.

43:48.201 --> 43:50.835
Some douche bred her so much, poor thing,

43:50.870 --> 43:53.171
she just had one giant hernia for a belly.

43:53.206 --> 43:55.840
Couldn't even walk.

43:55.875 --> 43:57.508
Those people can go straight to hell,

43:57.544 --> 43:59.377
as far as I'm concerned.

44:01.715 --> 44:04.882
Anything else I can do for you?

44:04.884 --> 44:08.770
You still in touch with your people?

44:08.805 --> 44:10.939
Depends on the type of
work you're looking for...

44:10.974 --> 44:14.392
your dos, your don'ts,
your wills, your won'ts.

44:14.444 --> 44:16.227
Well, if you tell me what you've got,

44:16.279 --> 44:19.230
I'll tell you what I'll do.

44:30.627 --> 44:33.578
I signed up three more
clients at the mall today.

44:33.630 --> 44:35.747
Jesus, those mall walkers...

44:35.799 --> 44:37.749
Those geezers are faster than you think.

44:39.886 --> 44:42.053
I could sleep for a decade.

44:48.979 --> 44:51.429
Did you get what I asked?

44:51.481 --> 44:54.098
- The, uh, code provisions?
- Ohh.

44:54.150 --> 44:56.901
Shit.

44:56.936 --> 45:01.489
Uh, it's in the car.

45:01.524 --> 45:05.159
Just give me a minute. I'll, uh...

45:05.195 --> 45:07.779
I'll go.

45:13.036 --> 45:15.370
Where's the...

45:47.821 --> 45:51.489
Chuck? Hey.

46:04.838 --> 46:06.003
Chuck?

46:06.056 --> 46:08.056
Yeah.
