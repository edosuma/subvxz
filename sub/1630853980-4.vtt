WEBVTT

00:38.413 --> 00:39.581
Here we go.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.097
Got something.

00:56.682 --> 00:57.683
Over here.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.938
Check it out.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.438
Over this way.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.193
In the stables.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.382
Come on.
Nothing here but horses. Let's go.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.301
Let's check this out.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.306
Hey! Get outta here.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.350
Find someplace else to shit.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.294
Coming through.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.295
Thank you, sir.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.952
Listen, I have to go away
for a little while.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.373
And I know you would like to come with me,

04:08.457 --> 04:11.001
but you make too much noise.

04:12.044 --> 04:13.837
Even when I tell you to be quiet.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.676
Which makes it harder for me to kill
the people who I need to kill.

04:23.472 --> 04:24.681
But, most importantly…

04:26.475 --> 04:28.227
I need you to watch over this boy.

04:30.979 --> 04:34.650
He's my grandson. Wolffe.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.948
A boy named Wolffe and a dog named No.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.704
I know you will protect him
and keep him safe.

04:48.539 --> 04:52.709
And if that evil mother of his tries
to take him again,

04:52.793 --> 04:55.212
you have my permission
to tear her throat out

04:55.295 --> 04:56.547
and eat her face.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.841
Okay?

05:02.052 --> 05:03.428
Good boy.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.623
I'm not saying I blame you.
I'm not one to blame.

05:32.124 --> 05:35.127
I'm just saying
I'm surprised you left Maghra alone

05:35.210 --> 05:37.337
when Sibeth's yet to be captured.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.882
Sibeth would be insane
to return to the palace.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.091
Sibeth is insane.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.848
I don't recognize this terrain.
Are you sure you're following the map?

05:48.557 --> 05:49.892
I have to make a stop along the way.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.269
This is not along the way.

05:54.730 --> 05:56.481
Dad.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.483
My son?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.236
I'm sorry.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.447
For what?

06:04.156 --> 06:06.408
I don't know what I was thinking. I--

06:07.284 --> 06:08.744
I freed Sibeth.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.955
And, you know, she's gone,
and it's my fault.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.921
I have many things that I am sorry for.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.089
Many regrets.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.927
But I never regret anything
that I did for my children.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.387
Okay?

06:28.180 --> 06:29.932
When you were freeing Sibeth,

06:30.015 --> 06:32.392
you were thinking like a father,
not a traitor.

06:32.476 --> 06:34.186
You were doing it for your son.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.480
Don't ever apologize about that.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.316
Thank you.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.361
How is your back?

06:44.279 --> 06:45.489
It hurts when I breathe.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.784
Yes. That pain is good.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.494
It reminds us that we're still alive.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.079
-Yeah.
-Yes.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.164
Stay alive, my boy.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.716
From the moment Sibeth arrived in Pennsa,

07:04.800 --> 07:06.176
I knew she was gonna be a problem.

07:06.260 --> 07:09.680
I just didn't realize
quite how much of a problem.

07:11.974 --> 07:14.601
I'd like to think
I would've been more decisive.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.480
Maybe had her killed in her sleep.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.859
So, instead, you married Maghra.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.278
Yeah.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.698
Seemed the best way
to keep a seat at my own table.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.283
And how has that worked out?

07:31.743 --> 07:32.953
Has its moments.

07:34.746 --> 07:35.998
And does Maghra know?

07:37.207 --> 07:38.208
Know what?

07:38.292 --> 07:39.793
That you're in love with her.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.634
I suppose she'd have to be a fool
not to know.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.890
Well, I think she's a fool for knowing
and doing nothing about it.

07:53.557 --> 07:54.892
She's a married fool.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.936
-And that's what I tell myself about you.
-Ha!

08:00.147 --> 08:02.149
At least I get you into my bed
now and then.

08:02.691 --> 08:05.152
I imagine you're not as lucky
with your queen.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.414
Who's there?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.791
-Calm your men. They're with me.
-Stand down.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.335
Guntar!

08:21.418 --> 08:22.461
Yeah.

08:24.046 --> 08:26.548
Well, this is where I leave you.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.759
What? Where are you going?

08:29.760 --> 08:31.970
Guntar and Pelz are associates of mine.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.597
I'm gonna travel the rest
of the way together,

08:34.681 --> 08:36.140
then I'll meet you at your house.

08:36.225 --> 08:38.977
I can give you knots
and call you a diplomatic emissary.

08:39.061 --> 08:42.481
No, we know other, quieter ways in.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.942
It's better for all concerned.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.236
-You don't trust me.
-Course not.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.738
That's what I like about you.

08:58.830 --> 08:59.915
Yes.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.211
Come here. My brother.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.731
What happened here?

09:25.357 --> 09:28.026
This is where we were attacked
by Tormada's bombs.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.031
It's like the earth was torn apart.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.953
This is where Bow Lion was killed.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.587
This is a weapon of the ancestors.

09:46.670 --> 09:50.048
Built by the Trivantian army.
They are called bombs.

09:50.132 --> 09:52.259
I felt the earth come apart.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.928
If the Trivantians have weapons
that can do this,

09:55.012 --> 09:56.680
no one will be able to stop them.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.309
We know where the bombs are.
We are on our way to destroy them now.

10:00.392 --> 10:02.311
And you've come here
to drag Ranger into it.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.396
Haven't you done enough to us, Baba Voss?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.274
You fled Trivantes just as I did.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.902
And when they invade,
you will find yourself back in there.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.821
Maybe. Maybe not.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.907
There's no coal in these mountains.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.534
No fruit. Just the wolves and us.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.494
And they have always left us alone.

10:19.578 --> 10:21.079
Who cares who rules below?

10:21.163 --> 10:23.457
-You say that now.
-I say it always.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.336
We belong to no nation.
And we will fight for no nation.

10:27.419 --> 10:30.756
Baba, you know I have no love
for the Trivantians.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.300
But I have no reason to fight for Paya.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.803
I will give you one, then.

10:37.846 --> 10:38.972
Tormada.

10:45.896 --> 10:46.897
Shut up.

10:47.523 --> 10:51.193
Does it really surprise you
to know that he wields this weapon?

10:51.276 --> 10:52.694
Fuck you, Baba Voss.

11:11.713 --> 11:12.798
He'll come.

11:54.131 --> 11:55.632
Did it have to be chickens?

11:56.258 --> 11:58.302
Chicken shit does throw the dogs off.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.304
Yeah, it throws me off a little too.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.472
Well, you didn't give me
very much time to plan.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.017
Fair enough.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.518
All right, listen.

12:06.602 --> 12:09.229
We're gonna be waiting
for you at the usual place.

12:09.313 --> 12:10.981
Come and find me when it's time to leave.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.108
Fine. What are you doing now?

12:13.192 --> 12:16.361
Well, I guess
I'll have to sell these fucking chickens.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.713
You smell like a farm.

13:59.423 --> 14:02.509
I'm painfully aware. Thank you.

14:04.553 --> 14:08.432
So… tell me about the Bank.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.392
Her name is Nevla.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.645
She's a politician but also a patriot.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.065
If there's a rogue faction
in the government, she'll root it out.

14:18.567 --> 14:19.735
If she believes you.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.614
If she doesn't,
this will be a very short conversation.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.957
Announcing the High Councillor, the Bank.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.709
Councillor.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.085
Roscoe, wait outside.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.588
Ambassador Trovere.

14:40.172 --> 14:43.091
I assume you have the former queen
tucked away somewhere.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.302
There's been a bit of a wrinkle.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.346
A wrinkle?

14:47.429 --> 14:48.972
She brought me instead.

14:51.308 --> 14:52.392
And who are you?

14:53.936 --> 14:55.145
I'm Harlan.

14:55.646 --> 14:58.607
Lord of Pennsa,
husband to Queen Maghra of Paya.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.484
Have you lost your mind?

15:00.567 --> 15:03.487
I assure you,
you'll want to hear what he has to say.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.863
Everything depends on it.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.617
Lord Harlan.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.328
Your reputation precedes you.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.873
That's unfortunate.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.418
But I assure you, I am here to help.

15:20.379 --> 15:21.380
You see…

15:22.506 --> 15:26.301
a rogue faction of your army is set
to march on Pennsa

15:26.385 --> 15:29.888
with advanced weapons
developed by a scientist named Tormada.

15:31.139 --> 15:36.144
Now, these weapons have the power
to flatten buildings, cities even.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.814
And, yes, they will attack us first.

15:38.897 --> 15:41.859
But make no mistake,
this is a coup against your government.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.069
You're insane.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.239
-That's… beside the point--
-Harlan.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.533
He is not lying.

15:52.286 --> 15:55.831
The last Payan queen
accused us of drowning an entire city.

15:55.914 --> 15:58.000
Now this Payan queen accuses us

15:58.083 --> 16:00.460
of a sneak attack
with some fantastical weapon.

16:00.544 --> 16:03.338
Now, let's be clear.
I'm not accusing your government.

16:04.381 --> 16:07.843
Although, it's likely your buddy,
the Military, is involved somewhere.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.720
You need to stop talking.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.638
He needs to stop talking now.

16:12.306 --> 16:13.390
Trovere, a word.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.624
My God, Harlan. Have you no fear at all?

17:20.707 --> 17:21.708
Oh, come on.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.502
She was either gonna believe us or not.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.128
She doesn't believe us.

17:28.841 --> 17:30.551
But she doesn't not believe us.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.806
She clearly senses something is amiss.

17:36.682 --> 17:37.724
Really?

17:39.268 --> 17:41.395
She told me
Tormada is actually in the city.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.108
He is scheduled
to address the Triangle tomorrow.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.276
Interesting.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.862
So, what do we do?

17:49.945 --> 17:51.029
We do nothing.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.449
We make ourselves scarce.

17:58.662 --> 18:01.164
Nevla knows a military scientist
couldn't command the army

18:01.248 --> 18:03.375
without help from someone higher up.

18:04.168 --> 18:05.878
She will quietly investigate.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.674
In the meantime,
no one can know I've returned,

18:10.757 --> 18:13.343
or Sibeth's absence will become a problem.

18:13.427 --> 18:14.511
Understood.

18:16.889 --> 18:18.557
So…

18:22.352 --> 18:23.353
dinner?

18:59.389 --> 19:02.309
You're gonna make it very hard
for me to leave.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.315
What if you just didn't?

19:10.067 --> 19:11.068
Didn't what?

19:13.904 --> 19:16.448
What is really waiting for you
back in Pennsa?

19:21.036 --> 19:23.914
I have devoted my whole life
to building that city.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.961
And the queen took it from you overnight.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.340
Now you're a guest in your own house.

19:33.924 --> 19:35.592
In a marriage of convenience.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.928
None of which suits a man
of your independent nature,

19:38.011 --> 19:39.304
if I'm being honest.

19:48.897 --> 19:50.148
Leave it behind you.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.778
We can have
a wonderful life together here.

19:54.862 --> 19:57.531
You can build something new.

19:59.658 --> 20:02.786
Trivantes has much more to offer you.

20:05.205 --> 20:06.456
And so do I.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.511
It's a very appealing offer.

20:23.182 --> 20:24.683
But not one you can accept.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.187
It's my city.

20:31.106 --> 20:32.774
Are you sure this is about Pennsa?

20:36.528 --> 20:39.448
Yeah. What else?

20:43.368 --> 20:45.287
She will never love you, Harlan.

20:50.334 --> 20:51.460
And yet…

20:53.462 --> 20:55.672
I can't bring myself to desert her.

21:00.802 --> 21:02.554
You're better than she deserves.

21:04.973 --> 21:06.725
You're better than I deserve.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.688
And still, we both end up alone.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.902
Both of your children are sighted.

21:18.111 --> 21:21.281
They're lucky you took them in
and protected them as you did.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.952
Sometimes I think
they would've been better served

21:25.035 --> 21:27.037
if I had taken their sight as babies.

21:27.746 --> 21:30.207
We'll never know, so no use wondering.

21:34.294 --> 21:38.507
When you were up on the mountain with me,
your heart was here with them.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.760
Now you're with them,
but your tread is no lighter.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.221
What will it take?

21:45.097 --> 21:48.267
Well, ask again when we've destroyed
those weapons, my friend.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.687
The weapons built by Edo's people.

21:51.770 --> 21:53.605
So you still blame yourself.

21:55.107 --> 21:57.860
You and I come from the same place.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.320
We have enough to atone for as it is.

22:00.404 --> 22:04.324
Taking on the sins of others
is just greedy, if you ask me.

22:05.659 --> 22:07.911
But if you want to feel guilt
about something,

22:09.204 --> 22:12.165
feel guilty about dragging me
from the comfort of my home

22:12.249 --> 22:13.750
to go on this endless walk.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.507
If you think about it,
it's a beautiful process.

22:21.091 --> 22:23.093
We dig the coal out of the earth,

22:24.094 --> 22:25.762
we heat it to the same temperature

22:25.846 --> 22:27.973
at which it was forged
in the earth's core.

22:28.765 --> 22:33.061
And that same fantastic, unimaginable heat

22:33.145 --> 22:37.357
that once formed it
in the molten depths of our planet

22:38.066 --> 22:41.361
now causes its immediate deterioration.

22:41.945 --> 22:44.573
And with that deterioration,
we find the true prize.

22:44.656 --> 22:49.828
We release the energy it's been storing,
like a hidden treasure,

22:49.912 --> 22:51.330
since it was formed.

22:51.413 --> 22:55.959
It's as though we were stealing
the very power of creation itself

22:56.043 --> 22:57.794
from inside the Earth.

22:57.878 --> 23:00.297
And then, of course,
we use that power as a weapon.

23:00.380 --> 23:04.635
One that can obliterate our enemies
in a matter of seconds.

23:06.094 --> 23:10.182
Which may sound like a nasty, unworthy use

23:10.265 --> 23:13.268
of such a magnificent feat
of nature and science,

23:13.352 --> 23:15.270
but when you consider the alternative,

23:15.354 --> 23:18.649
the battlefields of bloody combat,

23:18.732 --> 23:22.236
the vulgar stabbing and clubbing of war,

23:23.737 --> 23:26.281
it's quite an elegant solution, I think.

23:26.990 --> 23:30.702
Our victory was fast and decisive.

23:31.954 --> 23:34.081
Only a handful of our soldiers fell,

23:34.164 --> 23:39.086
while we decimated their entire army
in a matter of minutes.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.004
Their entire army?

23:41.797 --> 23:43.507
You are exaggerating, of course.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.050
No, he is not.

23:45.801 --> 23:48.846
Dispatches from the western front
say the same thing.

23:48.929 --> 23:52.391
Total annihilation in a matter of moments.

23:52.474 --> 23:55.936
That's very impressive.
How many of these weapons have you built?

23:56.728 --> 23:58.981
Almost 200, and more every day.

24:00.107 --> 24:03.986
Now is the time to act,
quickly and decisively,

24:04.069 --> 24:05.654
and unleash them on our enemies.

24:05.737 --> 24:07.781
Which enemies do you mean?

24:07.865 --> 24:11.410
Well, Paya for starters.

24:11.493 --> 24:13.954
What Tormada means to say is

24:14.037 --> 24:17.833
the mere demonstration
of these new weapons

24:17.916 --> 24:22.671
will allow us to change the dynamic
of our negotiations for the better.

24:22.754 --> 24:24.298
No, Councillor.

24:24.840 --> 24:30.345
What I mean to say is that my bombs
will allow us to conquer their kingdom

24:30.429 --> 24:32.097
and claim it as our own.

24:32.181 --> 24:34.099
Your bombs?

24:35.100 --> 24:37.394
You have forgotten your place, Tormada.

24:38.353 --> 24:41.148
They are not your weapons.
They belong to the republic.

24:41.231 --> 24:46.695
And how, and if, they are used
will be decided by this council!

24:48.197 --> 24:50.782
Agree to disagree, Councillor.

24:52.075 --> 24:54.411
They are, in fact, my bombs.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.538
They are under my control, are they not?

24:57.289 --> 25:00.876
And as a decorated general
such as yourself would know,

25:01.543 --> 25:04.838
whoever controls the weapons owns the day.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.466
You insubordinate bastard!

25:07.549 --> 25:09.843
-Tormada is right.
-What?

25:09.927 --> 25:12.262
Our empire grows weaker by the day

25:12.346 --> 25:15.224
because this council seeks
to appease our enemies

25:15.307 --> 25:16.725
instead of defeating them.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.352
What are you saying, Councillor?

25:18.435 --> 25:21.146
I'm saying this council has lost its way.

25:21.230 --> 25:24.775
Someone needs to give Trivantes
the leadership it deserves.

25:24.858 --> 25:29.821
Careful, Nevla.
Your words border on treason.

25:29.905 --> 25:33.158
Well, then, let's have no more words.

25:33.242 --> 25:35.327
Nevla, what are you doing?

25:35.410 --> 25:36.453
Don't do this!

25:45.420 --> 25:46.463
Trovere?

25:47.923 --> 25:51.343
-We have to go. Now!
-Wait, what's happening?

25:51.426 --> 25:53.929
We can't be here. Hurry!

25:54.471 --> 25:58.100
Well, no.
Will you just tell me what's going on--

27:17.095 --> 27:18.096
No.

28:00.222 --> 28:01.723
You're okay. Just relax.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.560
You've had quite a shock.

28:07.187 --> 28:08.355
What was that?

28:10.148 --> 28:11.525
It was Tormada's weapon.

28:14.278 --> 28:15.696
He destroyed the Triangle.

28:18.615 --> 28:19.616
What?

28:23.120 --> 28:25.247
He killed the entire council?

28:25.330 --> 28:26.331
Not all.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.001
Not the Bank.

28:29.501 --> 28:30.544
Nevla.

28:34.631 --> 28:35.841
She was a part of it.

28:38.760 --> 28:39.803
Yes.

28:47.853 --> 28:49.354
And so are you.

28:53.025 --> 28:55.736
Tormada, Nevla…

28:58.113 --> 28:59.156
and you.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.242
The third side of the Triangle.

29:03.118 --> 29:04.828
I was given no choice.

29:06.705 --> 29:08.749
This has been planned
ever since Greenhill Gap.

29:08.832 --> 29:10.250
The Triangle was corrupted.

29:10.334 --> 29:12.753
Nevla and Tormada approached me
to replace the People.

29:12.836 --> 29:15.881
-There was no saying no to them.
-Fine.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.219
But what am I doing here?

29:23.430 --> 29:28.060
What role do I play
in this little revolution of yours?

29:29.520 --> 29:31.522
I couldn't leave you in Pennsa to die.

29:34.775 --> 29:36.109
Are you serious?

29:42.074 --> 29:45.244
You've just witnessed the power
of these bombs.

29:45.994 --> 29:48.372
These weapons change everything.

29:48.455 --> 29:49.581
Paya is finished.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.000
Why die for it?

29:52.084 --> 29:53.794
Before your queen, who loves another,

29:53.877 --> 29:56.213
when you could live
at the top of the new order?

30:01.969 --> 30:03.053
I love you.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.682
I've risked everything to save you.

30:09.226 --> 30:10.853
I'm sorry it had to be done this way,

30:10.936 --> 30:13.564
but now you have to choose.

30:16.525 --> 30:17.526
Choose?

30:20.279 --> 30:21.280
What?

30:22.281 --> 30:26.493
You or… prison?

30:28.453 --> 30:29.538
Death, what?

30:30.080 --> 30:31.206
No, of course not.

30:31.957 --> 30:33.417
If you want to go back to Pennsa,

30:33.500 --> 30:35.669
I will grieve for you,
but I won't stop you.

30:47.723 --> 30:49.808
You've always been a survivor, Harlan.

30:50.851 --> 30:52.144
It's time to survive.

31:44.321 --> 31:46.573
It's warmer inside the palace, you know.

31:48.242 --> 31:49.660
Where do you think she is?

31:50.410 --> 31:51.828
I don't know.

31:53.914 --> 31:56.834
Three times now, I've tried to kill her.

31:58.126 --> 32:00.003
And each time she deserved it more.

32:00.087 --> 32:03.382
And yet, as I sit here
and listen to this storm,

32:03.465 --> 32:07.219
I find myself wondering
if she is warm and dry.

32:08.554 --> 32:13.642
Your sister has a unique way
of getting inside peoples' souls.

32:16.270 --> 32:17.563
You think we'll find her?

32:18.522 --> 32:20.816
After this storm,
our dogs will be useless.

32:22.484 --> 32:26.113
She could be running west.
She could return.

32:27.489 --> 32:29.616
She could be already facedown somewhere.

32:31.827 --> 32:33.579
I just want to be free of her.

32:35.122 --> 32:37.541
I suspect
we'll never be totally free of her.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.877
Not even when she's dead.

32:44.506 --> 32:46.592
You're a great comfort, Tamacti Jun.

32:47.384 --> 32:51.763
If I relied on my charm,
I would have been finished ages ago.

33:05.068 --> 33:07.779
I want him gone. Immediately.

33:08.655 --> 33:10.866
And by gone, I mean dead.

33:10.949 --> 33:13.660
No. He will be an asset.

33:13.744 --> 33:15.954
If you don't have the stomach for it,
I'll do it myself.

33:16.038 --> 33:18.123
You will not.
I'm telling you, he can help us.

33:18.207 --> 33:20.334
-He is a liability.
-Enough.

33:20.417 --> 33:22.544
We cannot be arguing amongst ourselves.

33:23.587 --> 33:28.008
Need I remind you, if we do not succeed,
we will be hanged for insurrection.

33:28.091 --> 33:30.802
You speak as if
we were part of a petty coup.

33:31.929 --> 33:34.264
We assassinated two-thirds
of the Triangle.

33:34.348 --> 33:35.474
This is a coup.

33:35.974 --> 33:39.228
And for it to succeed,
we need to gain the trust of the people.

33:39.311 --> 33:42.773
The Payan queen's husband
will not inspire trust.

33:42.856 --> 33:44.983
He will do exactly that

33:45.067 --> 33:47.819
if Queen Maghra's own husband
has turned on her and joined us.

33:48.403 --> 33:51.990
You overestimate your own appeal, Trovere.

33:53.867 --> 33:57.287
She would undo all of our hard work
because she fell in love with a Payan.

33:57.371 --> 33:59.748
Harlan is smart enough
to pick the winning side.

34:00.332 --> 34:01.959
He is intimately knowledgeable

34:02.042 --> 34:06.296
about every aspect of Pennsa's defenses
and mining operations.

34:07.506 --> 34:10.132
He will be an invaluable asset
to our new government.

34:11.885 --> 34:13.303
I am right about him.

34:13.387 --> 34:14.679
And if you're not?

34:16.639 --> 34:18.225
I'll kill him myself.

34:19.476 --> 34:22.728
Tormada rides out tomorrow.
You will accompany him.

34:24.523 --> 34:28.235
If you want to bring Harlan along,
then so be it.

34:28.735 --> 34:29.735
But, Trovere…

34:31.737 --> 34:34.074
this is no time to be sentimental.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.392
How do you know Ranger?

35:00.475 --> 35:02.895
We grew up together. In Trivantes.

35:04.271 --> 35:05.480
Served together.

35:08.817 --> 35:13.322
After I killed my father,
it was Ranger who helped me escape.

35:15.490 --> 35:18.160
He gave me his own knots
to help me get past the gate.

35:19.870 --> 35:21.747
Edo found out and threw him in jail.

35:22.915 --> 35:24.583
You must have meant a lot to him.

35:24.666 --> 35:26.043
I owe him my life.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.962
So, why does he hate Tormada so much?

35:29.046 --> 35:31.507
Tormada used prisoners
for his experiments.

35:32.090 --> 35:33.800
He believed he could restore sight.

35:34.801 --> 35:38.263
He never succeeded, but…
many suffered in his attempts.

35:39.723 --> 35:42.267
So that's why he has
the scars on his face?

35:42.351 --> 35:46.188
Tormada cut him open, over and over again.

35:46.772 --> 35:47.981
Over many years.

35:49.816 --> 35:51.944
Tormada sounds like someone worth killing.

35:53.987 --> 35:57.324
Yes. Slowly.

35:59.409 --> 36:00.911
And many times over.

37:38.967 --> 37:40.844
Oh, fuck.

38:00.113 --> 38:01.198
Maghra.

38:04.159 --> 38:05.994
It won't work, Maghra!

38:08.789 --> 38:10.874
I will not be put down like this.

38:17.256 --> 38:18.257
I can hear you.

38:18.340 --> 38:21.134
I can hear you, you dumb bitch!

38:32.104 --> 38:33.272
I--

39:47.679 --> 39:48.889
Why did you stop?

39:49.473 --> 39:50.891
My mask keeps slipping.

39:51.892 --> 39:53.060
Then work without it.

39:56.063 --> 39:57.314
She can't.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.776
If she breathes in any of this,
it will burn her lungs.

40:00.859 --> 40:02.486
Stay at your station.

40:04.738 --> 40:06.740
I'll just fix her mask.

40:09.576 --> 40:11.286
Finish your work.

40:16.291 --> 40:17.417
Lock her up!

40:18.335 --> 40:20.712
Go! You heard him.

40:21.922 --> 40:23.674
Walk! Hurry up.

40:27.970 --> 40:29.429
What do you see?

40:30.055 --> 40:31.473
I don't see anything.

40:32.558 --> 40:37.145
-I don't sense any archers.
-There are no archers.

40:37.229 --> 40:38.772
No archers means what?

40:40.148 --> 40:43.694
It means they are fortified
with more soldiers on the ground.

40:43.777 --> 40:44.820
Yes, my love.

40:45.487 --> 40:47.573
You and Wren, take Lu, go inside.

40:47.656 --> 40:49.491
Go find the children and bring them back.

40:49.575 --> 40:51.702
If they are sighted children,
that's where I belong.

40:52.202 --> 40:55.455
Fine. Gonna need a distraction.

41:01.503 --> 41:02.921
-Form up.
-Sir.

41:03.005 --> 41:04.673
Someone's at the back fence.

41:12.931 --> 41:15.267
-You two, come with me.
-Yes, sir.

41:59.228 --> 42:00.354
They're not here.

42:00.437 --> 42:02.189
Would they have been moved to Trivantes?

42:02.272 --> 42:05.234
No. This is where they build the bombs.
They need them here.

42:07.402 --> 42:08.570
Come on.

42:21.166 --> 42:22.292
Pick it up.

42:24.878 --> 42:26.463
Now get back to work.

42:46.483 --> 42:48.026
It's okay. You're safe.

42:52.614 --> 42:54.741
-They took Sheva.
-Where?

42:54.825 --> 42:58.203
The back of the dormitory.
They lock us there as punishment.

42:58.287 --> 42:59.621
Okay.

43:00.706 --> 43:02.791
Take them to the woods out back.
I'll find Sheva.

43:18.265 --> 43:19.558
Sheva?

43:21.810 --> 43:22.853
Sheva?

43:24.438 --> 43:25.439
Sheva.

43:28.650 --> 43:29.651
Haniwa?

43:46.585 --> 43:47.878
What are you doing here?

43:47.961 --> 43:50.422
It's okay. I'm here to help.

43:50.506 --> 43:53.008
-I don't believe you.
-I don't have time to argue.

43:53.509 --> 43:55.135
We're here to destroy the bombs.

43:55.636 --> 43:59.014
We already got the other kids out.
Just tell me where the bombs are.

43:59.890 --> 44:02.017
-You know about the bombs?
-Sheva.

44:03.185 --> 44:05.270
They're in the storehouse
behind the main house.

44:05.354 --> 44:08.899
Okay. Head to the woods in the back.

44:08.982 --> 44:10.984
My friends have your brothers and sisters.

44:11.068 --> 44:12.611
They'll get them somewhere safe.

44:12.694 --> 44:14.238
Oloman won't know where to find us.

44:21.161 --> 44:22.579
Oloman is dead.

44:23.163 --> 44:24.164
What?

44:25.207 --> 44:26.250
How?

44:26.959 --> 44:28.877
He was killed by the Trivantians.

44:32.589 --> 44:35.217
Sheva, We can't stay here. I'm sorry.

44:37.261 --> 44:38.262
Here.

44:41.807 --> 44:42.891
Come.

45:09.626 --> 45:10.919
They're down.

45:11.003 --> 45:12.671
-Who is that?
-She's with us.

45:15.591 --> 45:17.801
-Trivantians.
-How many?

45:19.052 --> 45:20.053
Too many.

45:20.137 --> 45:21.346
Everyone inside.

45:22.055 --> 45:23.265
Ranger.

45:25.559 --> 45:26.560
Okay.

45:38.989 --> 45:40.199
Harlan.

48:18.232 --> 48:20.859
We are facing a crisis
unlike any we have ever known.

48:21.485 --> 48:24.571
The Trivantians now have weapons
that can destroy entire cities.

48:24.655 --> 48:26.657
They're coming to Pennsa
to do exactly that.

48:26.740 --> 48:28.742
What do you mean, "entire cities"?

48:28.825 --> 48:30.786
They've built weapons of the ancestors.

48:31.328 --> 48:34.957
Weapons like thunder and fire,
capable of tearing up the earth itself.

48:35.040 --> 48:38.502
That's absurd. They're lying
to influence the terms of the treaty.

48:38.585 --> 48:39.795
I wish that were true.

48:39.878 --> 48:41.213
It makes more sense than believing

48:41.296 --> 48:44.383
they have this fantastical weapon
you speak of.

48:44.466 --> 48:46.552
Your Highness,
let us not be fooled by their lies--

48:46.635 --> 48:48.846
Please.

48:50.889 --> 48:53.100
I don't blame you for not believing.

48:53.183 --> 48:54.476
It sounds impossible.

48:54.560 --> 48:57.104
And no one will be happier than me
if I am wrong.

48:57.896 --> 49:01.608
But it is my duty, and yours,
to protect the Payan people.

49:01.692 --> 49:05.863
And I have heard enough
to believe that we are in grave danger.

49:07.155 --> 49:08.240
So, as your queen,

49:08.323 --> 49:13.036
I am asking you to put aside your doubts
and do your duty.

49:16.999 --> 49:20.085
We've sent a group
to destroy these weapons

49:20.169 --> 49:22.087
before they can reach our city.

49:22.171 --> 49:24.006
But we must be prepared for the worst.

49:24.089 --> 49:25.799
We are going to be invaded.

49:26.300 --> 49:27.968
And if we have any hope of stopping them,

49:28.051 --> 49:32.681
we will need not just every soldier
but every woman and man who can fight.

49:35.893 --> 49:39.438
Lady Benik.
Will I have your personal guard?

49:44.026 --> 49:45.485
Of course, my queen.

49:45.569 --> 49:46.570
Lord Diego?

49:48.989 --> 49:51.658
We will all yield our entire staffs
to the fight.

49:52.618 --> 49:53.785
Lord Torrance?

49:54.453 --> 49:55.537
My queen.

49:56.747 --> 49:57.789
Tamacti Jun.

49:58.749 --> 50:00.667
We will need the Witchfinders as well.

50:01.251 --> 50:03.170
They must be convinced to join us.

50:03.253 --> 50:05.839
You executed three of them
just the other day.

50:05.923 --> 50:09.134
But I spared the rest.
We will have to try.

50:12.763 --> 50:16.266
Great and mighty God Flame,
warm us with your grace.

50:17.100 --> 50:20.562
Grant us the strength
in these troubled times

50:21.980 --> 50:25.150
to cling to our faith
and execute your will.

50:26.693 --> 50:28.403
Ever since Kanzua fell,

50:29.071 --> 50:31.698
it feels like
the Payan Kingdom has lost its way.

50:33.492 --> 50:36.245
The Payan citizens are counting on us
to hold the line.

50:36.745 --> 50:37.955
So that's what we will do.

50:38.455 --> 50:40.415
And I know, like you do…

50:42.417 --> 50:44.253
we're going to get bloody doing it.

50:44.753 --> 50:46.421
They've already hung some of us,

50:47.047 --> 50:48.966
and we may all swing
when this is through.

50:49.466 --> 50:54.805
But like you, I will die a holy death
before I live an unholy life.

50:54.888 --> 50:57.015
-Lucien.
-Not now, Shiloh.

50:57.099 --> 50:58.183
The queen is here.

51:10.487 --> 51:13.866
Queen Maghra. This is a surprise.

51:13.949 --> 51:15.576
Maghra is not your queen.
