is a long, hard process...

25:42.040 --> 25:44.334

success rate.

She doesn't want to now.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.215
Mr. Hastings,
I'm sure you understand.

25:50.215 --> 25:56.137
Knowing the process is hard, and
Lucy might not succeed, doesn't
mean you stop loving her.

25:56.137 --> 26:00.475
It means your life
can't revolve around
whether she does or doesn't.

26:00.475 --> 26:02.435

26:47.272 --> 26:49.566
Now this Peaches
is in the wind.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.319
Yeah, Peaches in the wind
probably means Jimmy Cortez
is still around.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.904
You figure
she's hiding from him?

26:54.904 --> 26:56.990
What makes you think so clear
after being up all night?

26:56.990 --> 27:00.577
We've gotta find Peaches,
and we gotta sit on this guy
Cortez's place again.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.204
How would you put out
a description on her?

27:03.204 --> 27:06.750
"Subject looks like Rolonda
or Godfrey Cambridge."

27:06.750 --> 27:09.544
(stifles laugh)
That's accurate, Bobby.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.465
Crime's down.
Crime's down.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.676
They always come up with
these full-of-nonsense
statistics.

27:16.676 --> 27:20.096
Look at that cheek of yours.
I'd just as soon
not talk about it.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.390
You know, you need to get you
a little piece for your purse.

27:22.390 --> 27:25.685
-Arthur Cartwell.
-Says he has information
on your case.

27:25.685 --> 27:29.814
Yeah. He's got information
on every case, including that
big blimp that caught on fire.

27:29.814 --> 27:34.027
-Which one crashed? Not Snoopy?
-What do you got, Arthur?

27:34.027 --> 27:38.406
I'd like to communicate
in somewhat more confidential
surroundings.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.575
Oh, absolutely.

27:50.585 --> 27:54.422
-You look like something
the cat dragged in.
-Sleepless night.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.262
-So!
-So?

28:01.262 --> 28:05.100
So.
(coughs)

28:05.100 --> 28:10.063
Pretty pross named Angela,
she no longer amongst us.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.190
-Give it up, Cartwell.
-How 'bout you giving up...

28:12.190 --> 28:14.859
how much a eyewitness I.D.
gonna be worth?

28:16.236 --> 28:18.863
Being as how, uh, that
Willie Lopez clearance...

28:18.863 --> 28:23.493
put big feathers in y'all's
caps, and left me 'bout
as poor as when I woke up.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.788
I.D. and an eyewitness
testimony will get you
a couple thousand.

28:26.788 --> 28:29.582
But you gotta make all
the hearings, Arthur.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.710
I'm familiar with
how them wheels turn.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.879
Are we hearing chapter and verse
any point in the near future?

28:37.132 --> 28:40.760
Jimmy Cortez did Angela.
Cut her up in that alley
like a bird.

28:40.760 --> 28:44.139
-Which you saw from where?
-Across the street in a car.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.933
They're in the street having
a shouting match, then he take
her over in that alley...

28:46.933 --> 28:49.769
start cuttin' on her--

28:49.769 --> 28:53.690
I mean, I'm like, "Oh, man,"
but, you know, before I could
do anything, he gone.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.817
Hmm. What were
they fighting about?

28:55.817 --> 29:01.197
I don't know. I guess
it was a-a lover's quarrel.

29:01.197 --> 29:04.534
You know, certain elements.
You know, they--everybody
know they got a thing.

29:04.534 --> 29:10.915
-Anybody else around there?
-Uh-uh. But y'all got me.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.001
Hmm. You're lying, Arthur.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.670
See, now there you go
with this doubtin' me.

29:15.670 --> 29:19.966
That black whore send you
in here, huh? Told you what
she saw, clean up the story?

29:19.966 --> 29:22.051
I don't have the faintest idea
what you're talking about.

29:22.051 --> 29:25.013
Oh, sure you do, Arthur.
You see, we know
Peaches was there.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.600
She's afraid to testify.
She wants this guy collared,
she comes to you.

29:28.600 --> 29:33.730
(coughs) Okay.
Say that this is so.

29:33.730 --> 29:37.150
Cortez did do Angela.
Y'all want the clearance.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.736
-Shut up!
-Where we gonna find
Peaches, Arthur?

29:39.736 --> 29:43.782
-How much that gonna be worth?
-You not needin' to have
your jaw reset.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.496
C-note.

29:51.748 --> 29:52.999
(clicks tongue)

29:57.504 --> 30:02.425
-This is where you'll find her.
-You know what'd be
worth more?

30:02.425 --> 30:08.848
Now, I will now turn my
attentions on where that evil
Puerto Rican's hiding out.

30:08.848 --> 30:12.977
You see, I just oughta be
made an honorary member
of this department.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.190
Detective, I didn't know
where you were.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.776
-What is it, Gina?
-You have a male
babysitter at home?

30:19.776 --> 30:21.611
-What's wrong?
-He wants you to come home.

30:21.611 --> 30:24.614
Says he let someone in you gave
your card to, now he's worried
what they're doing.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.992
-Tell the Lieutenant
I'm taking lost time.
-All right.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.203
-I need to get through.
-You okay, Jill?

30:30.203 --> 30:32.622
-I need to get home.
-Busy, busy, busy.

30:32.622 --> 30:34.833
Shut up, Cartwell.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.463
♪♪

30:43.258 --> 30:45.260
(knocking)

30:48.054 --> 30:50.390
-Are the boys all right?
-I couldn't reach you,
and she said that...

30:50.390 --> 30:52.684
-you told her to come here.
-This is Lucinda Hastings.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.477
-She showed me your card.
-Hi, Mom!

30:54.477 --> 30:58.439
-Hi, Sweetheart! Hi.
-She looks bad. I didn't know
if I should call the hospital.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.733
-We got a sleepover.
-We do, huh?

31:00.733 --> 31:03.820
-Lying down in your room.
-Her name's Lucy.
She looks pretty sick.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.406
Oh. Well, I'll tell you what.

31:06.406 --> 31:09.993
You guys stay here,
and I'm gonna go see
how Lucy's feeling, okay?

31:09.993 --> 31:10.952
-Okay.
-All right.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.787
Stay with the boys.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.335
-(moaning)
-Oh, sh--

31:22.672 --> 31:24.799
-(sighs deeply)
-Jill.

31:24.799 --> 31:28.303
-What did you take, Lucy?
-Nothing. I'm too sick.

31:28.303 --> 31:31.890
I'm not asking you
what you stole. I'm asking
what drugs you took.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.893
I was trying for smack,
but it was a beat bag.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.936
-You don't know what was in it?
-No. (gasping)

31:36.936 --> 31:40.273
-Emmett!
-Walked out of that program,

31:40.273 --> 31:43.484
and tried to trick a cop
but it was a beat bag.

31:43.484 --> 31:45.778
Call an ambulance
and shut the door.

31:47.488 --> 31:50.116
So, when the bag was bad
you came back here to rob me?

31:51.242 --> 31:54.621
Still had to get off.

31:54.621 --> 31:57.999
I wasn't attracting too many
johns throwing up on myself.
(laughing)

31:58.708 --> 32:01.920
-Can I get some water?
-No, I don't want to put
anything in your stomach...

32:01.920 --> 32:04.923
-until we know what's going on.
-God, you've got so many rules.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.216
-(knocking)
-BOY: Mom, can I come in?

32:07.216 --> 32:10.762
-No, sweetheart.
-I want to draw
a picture for ya.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.641
-We'll do it later.
-(grunts)

32:14.641 --> 32:19.896
-What's gonna happen now?
-We'll get you taken care
of at the hospital.

32:19.896 --> 32:23.358
-Then you're going to jail.
-(sobbing)

32:32.700 --> 32:35.411
I ain't gonna be a part of it.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.414
Peaches, you reached out
to someone else to give
a perjured statement...

32:38.414 --> 32:40.500
'cause you wanted
this guy collared.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.877
(sobs)
Did you see how he cut her?

32:42.877 --> 32:46.923
-We'll protect you from Cortez.
-How you protected Angela?

32:46.923 --> 32:48.925
She came here and
begged you for help.

32:48.925 --> 32:50.551
There was nothing
we could do there, Peaches.

32:50.551 --> 32:52.720
Bring the D.A.
a whore getting slapped,

32:52.720 --> 32:55.181
all's we're gonna
get is, "Don't let
the door hit your ass."

32:55.181 --> 32:57.433
Murder's a different
story, Peaches.

32:57.433 --> 33:00.228
Eyewitness, you'll get housing,
D.A.'s squad looking after you.

33:00.228 --> 33:03.940
(sobs)
She was my friend, you know?

33:03.940 --> 33:07.402
-We were friends for six years.
-I know that.

33:08.361 --> 33:11.531
Here we go with the faucets.

33:11.531 --> 33:17.495
I'll make you this promise,
and I'll promise
Angela at her grave.

33:17.495 --> 33:21.958
Some future day when
Jimmy's unaware,

33:21.958 --> 33:24.419
I will come and take
a razor to him.

33:24.419 --> 33:28.464
But don't do nothing
simple, like give up
a statement now.

33:28.464 --> 33:33.511
When he's unaware, 'cause
a cut throat don't entail
walking around on bail.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.555
(knocking on door)

33:37.015 --> 33:40.226
-What's going on?
-That, uh, snitch Cartwell
says he can...

33:40.226 --> 33:42.061
put you with your perp.

33:47.191 --> 33:51.195
Peaches, we gotta go somewhere.
I-I'm gonna get Hank to take
you home, all right?

33:51.195 --> 33:53.656
-Sure. Whatever.
-I'll get Hank.

34:03.332 --> 34:04.625
CORTEZ:
I'm gonna get you, Cartwell.

34:04.625 --> 34:06.586
CARTWELL:
-Hey, batter, batter--
-Let me outta here!

34:06.586 --> 34:09.505
-Batter, batter, batter--
-CORTEZ:
Let me outta here, Cartwell!

34:09.505 --> 34:12.508
'Cause you're not going
nowhere, my brother!
(tires screech)

34:12.508 --> 34:15.261
-Let me outta here!
-CARTWELL:
Do just like I said.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.679
I'll be damned
if he don't got him.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.514
SIMONE: What's he got,
a board blocking the door?

34:18.514 --> 34:21.184
Here's your man,
Jimmy Cortez, trapped like
the Mighty Joe Young.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.311
You're the greatest, Arthur.
Now, get outta here.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.564
-RUSSELL: Get back.
-Shoo! Hard evidence!

34:26.564 --> 34:28.733
-You, me and Jimmy Cortez.
-Get outta here now.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.610
It's not too late
in the day to get that
money issued, is it?

34:30.610 --> 34:33.571
-Just call us in the morning.
-I'm going
down there, my brother.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.239
-Ready!
-Calm down here.
Drop that phone.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.242
This case has been
humiliating in every aspect.

34:38.242 --> 34:41.662
Get that phone thing.
Come on, take it out.

34:41.662 --> 34:43.873
Just calm down.

34:43.873 --> 34:47.376
-You scummy little snake!
-SIPOWICZ: Yeah, can't argue
with you there, Jimmy.

34:47.376 --> 34:49.504
-You better hope
I don't get out!
-Shut the hell up!

34:49.504 --> 34:51.547
Put 'em over your head!

34:55.843 --> 34:58.429
All right. It's all over.
It's all over.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.065
Detective.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.777
(whispers)
I gotta go.

35:18.032 --> 35:21.202
(sighs)
Hi. I hope
I'm not bothering you.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.204
-No.
-You gave me your card.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.956
How can I help you,
Mrs. Hastings?

35:24.956 --> 35:26.999
I've just come from
the hospital.

35:26.999 --> 35:29.127
The doctors seemed
to feel Lucy was stable.

35:29.127 --> 35:33.172
She is so sick. I was
so grateful to you, Jill,

35:33.172 --> 35:35.758
for helping us retrieve
those lost items.

35:35.758 --> 35:39.011
-Those items were stolen,
Mrs. Hastings.
-You're right.

35:39.011 --> 35:44.600
You're absolutely right.
But my understanding now is,
we dropped those charges.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.437
I'm pressing charges.
That's why Lucy's
being held.

35:48.437 --> 35:50.940
I see.

35:50.940 --> 35:56.529
-And you feel that's best?
-Mrs. Hastings, Lucy is a heroin
addict and a street whore.

35:56.529 --> 36:00.324
Her body and mind are both sick,
and she won't face any of that.

36:00.324 --> 36:02.743
I just can't believe
jail is the solution.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.872
-Are you gonna bail her out?
-I-I can't imagine
it's the solution.

36:05.872 --> 36:09.125
No. No, it's not.
Jail's a terrible place,

36:09.125 --> 36:11.127
but Lucy's in
a terrible place already.

36:11.127 --> 36:13.546
I can't see any other way
to make her understand that.

36:13.546 --> 36:17.842
Well, couldn't she just stay
where she is in the hospital,
with the guard outside?

36:17.842 --> 36:22.597
Mrs. Hastings,
I don't want to
hurt your feelings,

36:22.597 --> 36:25.600
but the way you're thinking
is helping to keep
your daughter sick.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.477
Lucy has to face
the truth without someone...

36:28.477 --> 36:31.147
protecting her, or else
she won't face it at all,

36:31.147 --> 36:33.900
and then she's gonna
wind up dead.

36:33.900 --> 36:37.403
-I know you don't want that.
-My husband is dying,

36:37.403 --> 36:39.989
and now you're saying
my daughter may die?

36:42.825 --> 36:46.996
I'm saying your daughter
has to learn how to live.

36:46.996 --> 36:50.166
-I wasn't anywheres around her.
-'Cause we told you
not to be, right, Jimmy?

36:50.166 --> 36:54.587
-Yeah, you're in big
compliance with the law.
-Sit down. Sit down!

36:56.422 --> 37:00.218
And the next time
you murder somebody,
asshole, change your shoes.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.094
The lab is gonna run
that shoe, Jimmy,

37:02.094 --> 37:05.056
and if that's Angela's
blood, you are going down
for murder, man.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.724
If that's blood, I don't
know how that got there.

37:06.724 --> 37:10.394
Right now, we got
cold-blooded murder.
If it went that way, fine,

37:10.394 --> 37:13.606
don't give no statement up--
we got a lot of pimp murders
go that way.

37:13.606 --> 37:17.026
You know, it didn't go down
like that! I ain't no pimp.

37:17.026 --> 37:20.238
So, what?
Was it the operation?
Huh, Jimmy?

37:20.238 --> 37:23.199
Did that enter into it?
(sighs heavily)

37:24.533 --> 37:27.411
She had me doing things
that was never who I was.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.664
Out there on the stroll,
giving me her money.

37:29.664 --> 37:34.418
I wanted a wife and a home!
She's treating me like a pimp.

37:34.418 --> 37:37.672
So what happened on the street?

37:37.672 --> 37:39.882
It was just like you said.

37:39.882 --> 37:44.887
We was beefin' about
the operation. She says
she's going out to work.

37:44.887 --> 37:48.516
I get all messed up drinking,
and I go out looking for her.

37:50.017 --> 37:52.478
It all extends out of that.

37:52.478 --> 37:56.857
You find her with a john?
Jimmy, that make you upset?

37:56.857 --> 37:59.110
(sniffles)

37:59.110 --> 38:03.698
(shivers)
When I met her,

38:03.698 --> 38:06.742
I thought she was
the most beautiful... girl.

38:08.494 --> 38:10.663
(sobbing)

38:10.663 --> 38:15.710
And I'm not a fag! You can't
just turn yourself into that!

38:19.922 --> 38:22.466
You want to write this up?

38:22.466 --> 38:25.803
Be dancing sometimes.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.805
Slow dancing.

38:30.725 --> 38:34.687
Be holding her.

38:34.687 --> 38:37.273
She was so sweet.

38:39.066 --> 38:41.819
And that smile--
(chuckling)

38:43.487 --> 38:48.701
"That's it, baby.
Don't change nothin'.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.619
Just do how you are."

38:54.290 --> 38:55.750
And you just killed her?

38:55.750 --> 38:59.295

the better rapport.

-Could I buy some of
your laundry detergent?

39:22.151 --> 39:25.738
I've decided not
to sell that in the squad.

At some point, if people
want to contact Lillian,
that's between them and her.

-How'd you come to that?
-Well, being in
a position of authority,

39:36.332 --> 39:40.419
-it made me uncomfortable.
-This isn't directed at me?

39:40.419 --> 39:44.090

-You're not selling to others,
but not to me?

You wanna take off?

So, boss, uh, you think
vitamins help me, uh, fight off
my upset so successfully?

You know that's not logical.
Don't say that 'cause it's

Having to keep everything
secret, Bobby,

41:02.042 --> 41:04.503
that's why a church wedding
doesn't really make sense.

Yeah, there's so many people

we can't even invite.

not wanting married people
to work together.
