00:02.859 --> 00:05.987
Admiral, are you trying
to tell this committee that God...

00:06.062 --> 00:08.826
has taken control
of Project Quantum Leap?

00:08.898 --> 00:12.698
That is the conclusion that
Dr. Beckett and I reached...

00:12.769 --> 00:16.899
after exhausting every other
possible scientific explanation.

00:16.973 --> 00:19.737
Is that ''God'' with
an upper or lowercase ''G''?

00:19.809 --> 00:24.803
<i>I mean, is G-O-D a military acronym</i>
<i>I'm not familiar with?</i>

00:24.881 --> 00:27.509
No, Senator.

00:27.583 --> 00:30.916
I'm referring to <i>... him.</i>

00:30.987 --> 00:34.218
- Or her.
- I hope you're right, Senator.

00:34.290 --> 00:39.455
And that God with a capital ''G,''
male or female,

00:39.529 --> 00:42.054
interfered with
Dr. Beckett's attempt...

00:42.131 --> 00:47.091
to travel within his own lifetime
and is using him to, uh,

00:47.170 --> 00:50.230
''put things right
that once went wrong.''

00:50.306 --> 00:53.605
Yes, sir.
<i>And you list some examples.</i>

<i>Being instrumental in</i>
<i>the integration of a small town.</i>

01:06.122 --> 01:11.424
All commendable, but not exactly
earth-shattering changes.

01:11.494 --> 01:15.021
They were earth-shattering
to those that he affected.

01:15.098 --> 01:17.760
<i>Admiral, I believe the point is that...</i>

01:17.834 --> 01:20.394
Dr. Beckett hasn't
significantly impacted...

01:20.470 --> 01:24.065
on the domestic and global conflicts
of the recent past.

01:24.140 --> 01:26.608
I mean, for $43 billion,

01:26.676 --> 01:30.373
he could at least have altered
the results of the last
presidential election.

01:30.446 --> 01:32.505
<i>[ Chuckling ]</i>

01:34.584 --> 01:39.681

suffering from partial amnesia.

01:39.755 --> 01:45.318
<i>He's unable to recall many</i>
<i>significant events ofhis lifetime.</i>
<i>And even ifhe were,</i>

01:45.394 --> 01:48.852
he seems only able to impact...

01:51.534 --> 01:54.526

01:54.604 --> 01:57.232
You expect us to believe...

01:57.306 --> 02:01.868
that God leapt Dr. Beckett
back into '56...

02:01.944 --> 02:05.880

with the lyrics to ''Peggy Sue''?

02:05.948 --> 02:09.508
He works in mysterious ways.

02:09.585 --> 02:11.985
Evidently, so does this project.

02:14.157 --> 02:17.490
Correct me if I'm wrong, Admiral,

02:17.560 --> 02:22.395
but do I understand
that you are the only person
who has had physical contact...

02:22.465 --> 02:26.959
with Dr. Beckett since
he supposedly leaped back in time?

02:27.036 --> 02:29.470
Physical contact, no.

02:29.539 --> 02:32.235
We appear to each other
as holograms.

02:32.308 --> 02:35.869
I can see and hear him,
and he can see and hear me,

02:35.945 --> 02:38.209
but we can't interact physically.

02:38.281 --> 02:40.715
And no one else can see
or communicate with him?

02:40.783 --> 02:45.743
No, Mr. Chairman.

around our brain waves.

In other words,
we have only your word that...

<i>Admiral,you must understand...</i>

02:56.499 --> 03:00.902
that this committee cannot justify
funding a project...

03:00.970 --> 03:04.633
that costs $2.4 billion a year...

all right?

Okay. Then just before she falls asleep

14:50.913 --> 14:54.576
you whisper lovingly in her ear,

the flakes were big and wet,

16:46.595 --> 16:49.257
the way I remember them as a boy.

16:49.331 --> 16:51.526
You went to an old mill,

16:51.600 --> 16:53.898
<i>just like the one where</i>
<i>the Gestapo caught Moulin.</i>

16:53.969 --> 16:58.633
<i>There was a German officer there,</i>
<i>tall and arrogant,</i>

16:58.707 --> 17:00.641
and you started to make love to him.

17:00.709 --> 17:02.973
Roget, please, don't do this.

17:03.045 --> 17:06.105
<i>Before it was over,</i>
<i>I bled him till the snow turned red.</i>

17:06.181 --> 17:08.979
- That's enough!
- He looked like you.

17:09.050 --> 17:11.212
<i>Except for the eyes.</i>

17:11.286 --> 17:14.915
He had the eyes of a man
who could kill.

17:33.642 --> 17:35.576
<i>[ Diane ]</i>
<i>You hate me, don't you?</i>
<i>What?</i>

17:35.644 --> 17:38.545
No.
I didn't tell you
I'd been married before...

17:38.613 --> 17:41.946
because if I didn't tell you
then it didn't happen,
at least not for you.

17:42.017 --> 17:46.044
And if it didn't happen for you,
then I could pretend
it didn't happen for me.

17:46.121 --> 17:49.522
There's a weird logic in that.
You hate me.

17:49.591 --> 17:52.617
I don't hate you.

17:52.694 --> 17:56.994
Look, it's 1 960.
Divorce is not unheard of.

17:57.065 --> 18:00.057
What is unheard of is being kidnapped
by your ex-husband.

18:00.135 --> 18:02.194
I should have known Roget
would never let me go.

18:02.270 --> 18:05.433
I knew he was jealous
when I started dating him.

18:05.507 --> 18:07.475
I found it flattering.

18:07.542 --> 18:10.875
I just thought he was being very French,
and that once we were married
it would all end.

18:10.946 --> 18:14.382
It got worse.
He made me a prisoner in my own home.

18:14.449 --> 18:17.976
We never went out.
I couldn't have dinner parties
or see old friends.

18:18.053 --> 18:21.955
He wouldn't even let me shop or
get my hair done without him sending
one of his bodyguards along.

18:22.023 --> 18:25.584
Bodyguards?
Roget smuggles arms.

18:25.660 --> 18:29.323
Into Africa, mostly.
It's very lucrative,
but it's very dangerous.

18:29.397 --> 18:33.299
Didn't you know this
before you married him?
No.

18:33.368 --> 18:37.327
I knew during the war
he smuggled guns into France
for the Resistance,

18:37.405 --> 18:39.635
but I never dreamed
it became his profession.

18:39.708 --> 18:43.007
He always talked about
how horrible it had been--

18:43.078 --> 18:46.241
how everyone close to him
had been caught and executed
by the Germans,

18:46.314 --> 18:49.750
and how, after the war,
he alone survived.

18:49.818 --> 18:52.514
Diane, did you love him
or feel sorry for him?

18:52.587 --> 18:54.885
A little of both.

19:01.229 --> 19:04.926
I don't think I knew what love was
until I met you.

19:07.002 --> 19:10.267
Oh, Tom, I'm so afraid
he'll hurt you.

19:17.078 --> 19:19.342
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>Admiral, we're here to render our decision.</i>

19:19.414 --> 19:22.144
Mr. Chairman,
I would like to request...

19:22.217 --> 19:24.549
a 48-hour delay in that rendering.

19:24.619 --> 19:28.077
Admiral, nothing is going to change
over the weekend.

19:28.156 --> 19:31.057
Except history.
In 1 960,

19:31.126 --> 19:34.220
<i>an American U-2 reconnaissance plane</i>
<i>was shot down...</i>

19:34.296 --> 19:37.390
<i>on an intelligence mission</i>
<i>over the Soviet Union.</i>

19:37.465 --> 19:42.528
By this Monday, the U-2 incident
will not have occurred.

19:42.604 --> 19:46.040
Dr. Beckett is going to abort the mission,

19:46.107 --> 19:49.133
thereby changing history
on a global basis...

19:49.211 --> 19:51.304
and also proving
that he's back there.

19:51.379 --> 19:53.609
And if there are no changes,

19:53.682 --> 19:56.446
will you admit the Quantum Leap
is a failure...

19:56.518 --> 19:59.112
and go quietly into
the sea of retirement?

19:59.187 --> 20:02.281
You have my word on that, Senator.

20:02.357 --> 20:05.884
You have until Monday at 1 0:00.

20:12.834 --> 20:16.531
- <i>He's drinking a Kir.</i>
- So?

20:16.605 --> 20:21.508
So, it's very French.
So's our champagne.

20:21.576 --> 20:25.535
You know, you remind me of me.

20:25.614 --> 20:28.174
You?
Mm-hmm.

20:28.250 --> 20:32.414
On my first train ride,
I was confused, frightened.

20:32.487 --> 20:36.048
I was sure everybody on board
was out to get me.

20:36.124 --> 20:39.423
How old were you?
Two.

20:39.494 --> 20:43.089
At two, it's appropriate.
Not at 26.

20:43.164 --> 20:45.428
It is if you've been frightened.

20:51.172 --> 20:53.732
Hmm.
What are you doing?

20:53.808 --> 20:55.742
Reading your champagne bubbles.

20:55.810 --> 21:00.543
It's kind of like reading tea leaves,
only it's more accurate.

21:00.615 --> 21:02.947
It is?
Mm-hmm.

21:03.018 --> 21:07.921
I can see that
you're going to pass your bar,

21:07.989 --> 21:10.287
become a lawyer,

21:10.358 --> 21:12.588
go into corporate law--
Yuck.

21:12.661 --> 21:17.428
Find that boring,
enter politics,
Hmm.

21:17.499 --> 21:20.798
and become the first president
of the United States...

21:20.869 --> 21:23.201
to give birth in the oval office.

21:24.572 --> 21:27.939
Is that how your mother
calmed you down--
by making you laugh?

21:30.679 --> 21:33.739
Uh, no.
She would give me a book to read.

21:33.815 --> 21:36.511
At two?

21:36.584 --> 21:40.384
What were you,
some child prodigy?
<i>[ Al ] As a matter of fact, he was.</i>

21:40.455 --> 21:43.049
At five, he could do calculus
in his head.

21:43.124 --> 21:45.490
At 1 0, he could beat
a computer at chess.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.120
Would you excuse me?
I need to go to the restroom.

21:48.196 --> 21:51.757
Not the men's room again.
Sam, I'm startin' to feel like a pervert.

21:51.833 --> 21:55.599
Um, I will be in the compartment.

21:57.439 --> 21:59.907
I have some girl things to do...

22:01.876 --> 22:04.936
and something very special
to put on.

22:12.954 --> 22:15.184
<i>You know, my first wife and I...</i>

22:15.256 --> 22:19.124
spent our honeymoon
on the train to Niagara Falls.

22:19.194 --> 22:21.492
And my third wife.

22:21.563 --> 22:27.092
And my fourth wife--
Or was it the fifth?

22:27.168 --> 22:29.659
Fourth or the fifth?

22:29.738 --> 22:34.368
Let me see. The fourth was--
What was her name?
Sharon.

22:34.442 --> 22:38.208
She wore pink baby dolls.

22:38.279 --> 22:42.181
Maxine was the fifth one.
She didn't wear anything at all.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.650
<i>She used to flavor her toes</i>
<i>with mint leaves.</i>

22:44.719 --> 22:50.680
It was Maxine, Sam.
I took my first, third and fifth wife
to Niagara Falls.

22:50.759 --> 22:53.387
How odd.
That's funny, Sam.

22:53.461 --> 22:55.395
Having someone try
to kidnap your bride isn't.

22:55.463 --> 22:57.931
You're kidding.

22:57.999 --> 23:00.399
You're not kidding.

23:00.468 --> 23:03.869
Oh, damn, I forgot.
We pulled Ziggy's research unit off-line.

23:03.938 --> 23:07.499
What?
Well, it's the end of the month.
The funds are a little low.

23:07.575 --> 23:10.703
It happens. You make cuts.
No, not in research
you don't make cuts.

23:10.779 --> 23:13.646
Don't worry.
I can switch some funds
from the motor pool.

23:13.715 --> 23:16.115
You know, sometimes I feel like
nobody back there gives a damn.

23:16.184 --> 23:18.015
I do.

23:20.121 --> 23:23.579
Yeah, I-I know you do, Al.
I'm-I'm sorry.

23:23.658 --> 23:27.560
Did you ask Diane to call her daddy
about the U-2 mission?

23:27.629 --> 23:30.496
- I've got bigger problems.
- I don't think so.

23:30.565 --> 23:33.125
Her ex is trying to kidnap her, and I--

23:35.537 --> 23:39.598
Al, she thinks I'm her husband,

23:39.674 --> 23:42.370
the man that she married this morning
at who knows where,

23:42.444 --> 23:47.006
and in a few minutes
she's gonna expect me to go in there
and make love to her.

23:47.081 --> 23:49.015
What's the problem?

23:49.083 --> 23:51.278
I'm not her husband!

23:51.352 --> 23:53.183
To her you are.
But not to me!

23:53.254 --> 23:57.315
Al, it's-it's not morally right...

23:57.392 --> 23:59.485
to sleep with a woman
that you don't love.

23:59.561 --> 24:02.860
I agree.
You agree?

24:02.931 --> 24:08.892
I have loved every woman
I ever slept with...

24:08.970 --> 24:12.030
at the time I slept with them.

24:13.942 --> 24:18.675
Okay. All right.
I don't love her yet.

24:18.746 --> 24:21.180
What do you mean, yet?

24:21.249 --> 24:23.240
Well, I mean, I'm just--

24:24.853 --> 24:27.913
You think
I'm falling in love with her?

24:27.989 --> 24:30.219
Oh, Sam.

24:30.291 --> 24:33.749
You're going to have
to bite the bullet.

24:33.828 --> 24:36.626
While I go back
to put research online,

24:36.698 --> 24:40.634
you're going to have to face
a beautiful woman...

24:40.702 --> 24:45.662
who wants to spend the entire night
making mad, passionate love to you.

24:47.041 --> 24:51.944
It's a dirty job,
but somebody's got to do it.

25:19.874 --> 25:22.775
[ Thinking ]
Is this really
what you want me to do?

25:22.844 --> 25:25.005
If it is,
I wish you'd give me a sign.

25:25.079 --> 25:27.741
<i>[ Door Opens ]</i>

25:33.121 --> 25:35.112
Oh, boy.

25:38.326 --> 25:43.889
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>
<i>My-My name isn't Tom Macbride.</i>

25:43.965 --> 25:45.956
Oh? What is it?

25:47.835 --> 25:52.135
Beck-- Beckett.
It's Sam-Sam Beckett.
The playwright?

25:54.175 --> 25:56.109
I don't think so.

25:56.177 --> 25:58.111
Then who?

25:58.179 --> 26:03.742
Well, um, primarily
I'm a quantum physicist.

26:03.818 --> 26:06.048
Oh?

26:06.120 --> 26:07.917
I like it.

26:07.989 --> 26:10.822
And I'm Lara,

26:10.892 --> 26:14.225
the K.G.B.'s sexiest agent.

26:14.295 --> 26:18.925
I boarded the <i>Orient Express</i>
with orders to seduce Sam Beckett,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.400
America's most famous
astrophysicist...

26:21.469 --> 26:24.700
Quantum physicist.

26:24.772 --> 26:27.764
and have him fall madly in love with me
and drive him crazy...

26:27.842 --> 26:32.438
by refusing to sleep with him
until he tells me
how to make a hydrogen bomb.

26:36.417 --> 26:40.683
You don't like it.
Okay.

26:40.755 --> 26:43.019
Tell me your fantasy.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.698
I'm Tom Macbride.

26:56.938 --> 27:00.237
I'm a police lieutenant
on my honeymoon...

27:00.308 --> 27:02.469
with the most beautiful woman
I've ever known.

27:02.543 --> 27:06.377
Oh! I like that story.

27:12.954 --> 27:14.546
[ Gasps ]
What is it?

27:14.622 --> 27:17.147
It's Roget!

27:17.225 --> 27:19.318
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>I don't see him.</i>
<i>Are you sure you didn't imagine it?</i>

27:19.394 --> 27:21.419
<i>[ Diane ]</i>
<i>He was wearing the same trench coat</i>
<i>he had on this afternoon.</i>

27:21.496 --> 27:23.896
How could he have caught up with us?

27:23.965 --> 27:28.334
I don't know.
Car, plane. I don't know.

27:28.403 --> 27:30.871
What are you gonna do?
Walk the train.

27:30.938 --> 27:33.236
No.
Look, if he's on the train, I'm gonna
have to face him sooner or later.

27:33.307 --> 27:35.605
He'll kill you!
No one's gonna kill me.

27:35.677 --> 27:38.339
I'm just gonna explain to the conductor
what's going on,

27:38.413 --> 27:40.278
and then they'll turn him over
to the police at the next stop.

27:40.348 --> 27:42.816
The police won't do anything.
Look, he tried to kidnap you.

27:42.884 --> 27:45.148
I know, but it's our word against his.

27:45.219 --> 27:47.483
And even if they do believe us,
it might be considered
a domestic matter.

27:47.555 --> 27:51.286
There's this case in Buffalo in '49
where a man tried to kidnap his ex-wife
to try and win her back.

27:51.359 --> 27:55.591
Diane, shh.

27:55.663 --> 27:58.257
Why are you doing this?

27:58.332 --> 28:00.800
So I won't scream.

28:08.209 --> 28:10.268
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>All aboard!</i>

[ Whistle Blowing ]

28:46.647 --> 28:49.673
Ah, the groom.
<i>Je vous en prie.</i>

28:58.793 --> 29:01.990
You know, I was wondering.

29:02.063 --> 29:05.999
Do you think Diane married you
because you're a policeman?

29:06.067 --> 29:09.969
Maybe subconsciously
she was seeking a protector,
a blue knight.

29:10.037 --> 29:14.371
<i>I asked my analyst about it this morning,</i>
<i>and he thought it quite possible.</i>
What else did he say?

29:14.442 --> 29:17.502
Regretfully, that I was quite mad.

29:17.578 --> 29:19.546
I would agree with that diagnosis.

29:21.082 --> 29:23.710
- I love her.
- You want to possess her.
That's not love.

29:23.785 --> 29:25.912
She took a vow...

29:25.987 --> 29:27.921
to love, honor and obey until death.

29:27.989 --> 29:31.288
<i>She changed her mind.</i>
She doesn't have that right.

29:31.359 --> 29:34.021
That's no longer strictly
a male privilege, pal.

29:39.100 --> 29:41.500
- You're not afraid of me?
- No.

29:41.569 --> 29:43.628
You should be.
I'm going to kill you.

No, you're not.
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

Tom Macbride was found dead
on this train.

29:50.812 --> 29:54.805
Stabbed through the heart.
Your lack of fear shows
how little you know of me.

29:54.882 --> 29:59.581
<i>Maybe I should tell you a little war story</i>
<i>about a woman I used to know.</i>

30:00.688 --> 30:03.418
She had a Nazi lover,

30:03.491 --> 30:08.224
and she gave him the names
of everyone in our village
who was with the Resistance.

30:08.296 --> 30:12.392
The Gestapo caught,
tortured and hung them all.

30:12.466 --> 30:14.491
- All but me.
- <i>You killed her?</i>

30:14.569 --> 30:17.697
- <i>Yes.</i>
- She didn't give them your name?

30:17.772 --> 30:19.364
No.

30:19.440 --> 30:23.240
<i>I suppose because</i>
<i>she was my mother.</i>

30:39.827 --> 30:42.591
<i>Sam, take him!</i>

You let 'em get your gun?

30:53.140 --> 30:55.267

You probably didn't have any choice.

This is gettin' dangerous, Sam.

30:57.879 --> 30:59.870
You think?

Ziggy says your best shot
is to have the conductor
radio ahead for the police,

31:07.288 --> 31:11.349
because Roget is wanted in New York
for murdering his psychiatrist.

31:11.425 --> 31:13.791
If you swim with the sharks,
you get bit.

the train in Niagara--
