00:07.215 --> 00:09.766
I wore this fake piece of shit
to a charity event.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.467
<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...

00:11.469 --> 00:12.951
Enjoy your expulsion, asshole.

MARTY: <i>'Cause some big donor said
"boo," Roscoe became a pariah.</i>

00:16.517 --> 00:18.413
<i>Then it was just everyone</i>
<i>feeling free to spew</i>

00:18.533 --> 00:20.528
<i>whatever hateful shit</i>
<i>was inside of them.</i>

00:20.963 --> 00:23.013
So, the school, uh, sent over
the surveillance footage.

00:23.048 --> 00:24.464
There's security footage?

00:24.516 --> 00:26.183
He's got a hoodie on,
same brand that you wear.

00:26.218 --> 00:28.969
Was shocked to learn
that a man such as yourself

00:28.971 --> 00:30.687
would not only have
a baby out of wedlock,

00:30.723 --> 00:32.139
but a gender-bending son.

00:32.141 --> 00:33.440
You involved my son in this?

00:33.475 --> 00:35.442
So, all I have to
do to get things

00:35.477 --> 00:37.861
back on the right track is
start being your little bitch.

00:37.896 --> 00:40.197
But you're already
my little bitch.

00:40.232 --> 00:41.698
MARTY: <i>It turns out
that Azhar Halabi was</i>

00:41.734 --> 00:43.200
in bed with Thomas Altshuler.

00:43.235 --> 00:45.035
And guess who suppressed
that shit?

00:45.070 --> 00:47.654
When we look back on the
formation of this company,

00:47.706 --> 00:49.206
our first bouncing baby app,

00:49.241 --> 00:51.158
we're gonna say, "Hey, you
remember when it all began?"

00:51.210 --> 00:52.993
Word on the street was that you
were looking for a new position.

00:53.045 --> 00:55.328
I'm going to offer it to you.

00:55.330 --> 00:56.463
Huh.

00:56.498 --> 00:57.998
When exactly are you due?

00:58.050 --> 00:59.382
Three weeks from tomorrow.

00:59.418 --> 01:01.218
(laughing):
Whoa.

01:01.253 --> 01:03.003

Oh, yeah.

Right this second, I'm fucked.

02:27.212 --> 02:29.713
I mean, triple-decker-

02:29.748 --> 02:31.998
Deeply, physically, emotionally

02:32.050 --> 02:34.834

02:34.886 --> 02:37.304
You see, my sugar mama,
Denna Altshuler,

02:37.339 --> 02:40.257
has pulled out...
prematurely as it were--

02:40.309 --> 02:43.727
leaving me in a state
of <i> expansionus interruptus.</i>

02:43.762 --> 02:45.595
The bank says they will float me

02:45.647 --> 02:47.264
and I stress this,

02:47.316 --> 02:50.233
if all of these new companies
that we've taken over

02:50.269 --> 02:52.018
will stay the course.

02:52.020 --> 02:54.821
If I can go through
and one by one convince

02:54.856 --> 02:57.190
each of these CEOs
whose companies

02:57.242 --> 02:59.993
Denna raped and pillaged
to trust... me.

03:00.028 --> 03:01.995
And I'm close.

03:02.030 --> 03:03.997
I am so, so very close.

03:04.032 --> 03:07.117
What would that mean
for the new Kaan and Associates?

03:07.169 --> 03:09.536
Well, it would mean
that my balls,

03:09.588 --> 03:11.671
already very healthy
in weight and girth,

03:11.707 --> 03:15.425
would grow to heretofore
unrecorded tumescence.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.510
If I can make this happen,

03:17.546 --> 03:20.297
I will have one of the richest
management consultancies

03:20.349 --> 03:22.015
on the planet.

03:22.050 --> 03:23.216
Me.

03:23.268 --> 03:24.601
Not Denna Altshuler.

03:24.636 --> 03:26.720
Not some faceless consortium.

03:26.722 --> 03:28.355
Me. Marty Kaan.

03:28.390 --> 03:32.225
The guy with the big
fucking balls!

03:32.227 --> 03:34.311
But right now?

03:34.363 --> 03:37.230
It ain't looking too good.

DOUG:
Oh, hey, Denna.

03:43.572 --> 03:44.871
Uh, we're about to get
a very important call

03:44.906 --> 03:46.573
about our app. We haven't
even launched yet and...

03:46.625 --> 03:47.791
Fuck off.

03:47.826 --> 03:49.626
Okay.
Oh! (laughs)

03:49.661 --> 03:52.078
(phone ringing)
I'm dumping K and A.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.914
Okay.
No, dumping's too personal a word.

03:54.916 --> 03:56.216
It sounds like I have
some emotional investment

03:56.251 --> 03:57.250
or something.

03:57.302 --> 03:58.418
So, let's try this.

03:58.420 --> 03:59.636
I am withdrawing my financial

03:59.671 --> 04:00.804
and strategic support
of K and A.

04:00.839 --> 04:02.972
That was better. Okay.

04:03.008 --> 04:04.758
I'm totally fine taking
a $20 million hit

04:04.760 --> 04:07.093
in order to never have
to speak to you again.

04:07.095 --> 04:09.479
Yet, you had your driver
drop you off downstairs

04:09.514 --> 04:11.481
so that you could come all
the way up here and say

04:11.516 --> 04:13.099
that in person?
I don't know.

04:13.151 --> 04:14.651
Sounds a little girly to me.

04:14.686 --> 04:16.903
Am I hurt in a girly way?

04:16.938 --> 04:19.773
Actually, I'm surprised
by it, but yeah.

04:19.825 --> 04:21.774
I am a little hurt.

04:21.777 --> 04:23.076
Yeah.
So, I ask myself

04:23.111 --> 04:25.161
why? I mean,
what is this feeling?

04:25.197 --> 04:27.330
And I realize it's
a very young feeling.

04:27.366 --> 04:28.832
It's a feeling I haven't had

04:28.867 --> 04:30.450
since my high school
boyfriend dumped me.

04:30.452 --> 04:31.418
Oh, boy, this is gonna long.

04:31.453 --> 04:32.619
Could take forever.
Why is that?

04:32.671 --> 04:34.838
Was this a great love?
Was this the one that got away?

04:34.873 --> 04:36.623
Were we in some amazing
swirl of romance?

04:36.675 --> 04:37.924
Fuck no.

04:37.959 --> 04:39.292
No.

04:39.344 --> 04:40.794
I'm having this very young
feeling because you...

04:40.796 --> 04:42.262
are a child.

04:42.297 --> 04:45.131
And I am getting as far away
from you as possible.

04:45.183 --> 04:48.268
You used my son as a pawn
in your little bullshit

04:48.303 --> 04:50.637
chess game.
Fuck you, Denna.

04:50.689 --> 04:52.305
What, you thought I wasn't
gonna return fire?

04:52.357 --> 04:55.442
I think you put the gun
to your own head.... as usual.

04:56.862 --> 04:58.478
That's gonna be fun to watch.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.562
Thank you.

04:59.614 --> 05:01.648
Any second now. All right?
Doug, calm down.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.316
I don't... Oh, hey, Denna!

05:03.318 --> 05:05.151
Uh, we're about to get a very
important call on our app.

05:05.153 --> 05:06.319
We haven't even launched...
Fuck off.

05:06.321 --> 05:08.788
Oh! (laughs)
(phone ringing)

05:08.824 --> 05:10.156
Ooh! Oh.
Uh...

05:10.158 --> 05:12.625
Oberholt. Yeah, I'll hold.

05:12.661 --> 05:14.994
Oh, my God. Come on, come on, come on.
Hey.

05:14.996 --> 05:15.995
Get the fuck out of here.
What's he saying?

05:15.997 --> 05:17.163
Put it on speaker.
Okay.

05:17.215 --> 05:18.882
I can't hear. Put it on speaker.
Okay, okay. Shh...

05:18.917 --> 05:21.551
Okay.

05:23.088 --> 05:25.305
So, I guess it wasn't bullshit.
Oh, my God.

05:25.340 --> 05:27.340
There is very strong interest
in our app

05:27.342 --> 05:28.725
from Google.

05:28.760 --> 05:29.976
They're gonna make
an offer today.

05:30.011 --> 05:31.344
Oh! (laughs)
Whoa.

05:31.346 --> 05:33.813
Oh, my God!
Okay, calm down!

05:33.849 --> 05:35.815
Just calm down, just calm down!

05:35.851 --> 05:36.850
You're yelling!
I'm not!

05:36.852 --> 05:38.351
Yes, you are! Listen...
You are!

05:38.353 --> 05:39.736
I'm not. I'm very calm.

05:39.771 --> 05:40.854
Oh, God.
Oh, good news.

05:40.856 --> 05:41.855
Move, bitch.

05:41.907 --> 05:43.740
I'm not even making eye contact.

05:43.775 --> 05:45.158
But, hey, it just happened!

05:45.193 --> 05:46.860
That call I was
talking about, so...

05:46.862 --> 05:48.495
I mean, dreams do come true.

05:48.530 --> 05:50.280
- We can celebrate at the relaunch party
tonight. - Absolutely.

05:50.332 --> 05:51.531
If there's something
to celebrate!

05:51.583 --> 05:52.699
Don't get too excited.
Well, hey,

05:52.701 --> 05:53.783
can I, uh, say something?

05:53.835 --> 05:54.834
I know that Kelsey and I are

05:54.870 --> 05:56.870
no longer, um... well,

05:56.922 --> 05:58.505
you don't have to spell it out.
We know, so don't.

05:58.540 --> 05:59.923
We're not having sex anymore.

05:59.958 --> 06:01.040
Don't, don't, don't!
But I thought

06:01.092 --> 06:02.425
since I don't have
a date tonight,

06:02.461 --> 06:04.244
and Clyde's still in mourning
after he killed his dad,

06:04.279 --> 06:07.130
and we might be celebrating
the acquisition of our company,

06:07.182 --> 06:10.216
perhaps we could...
I don't need

06:10.268 --> 06:11.885
to spell it out...
Have sex again.

06:13.388 --> 06:15.722
I'm not hearing a no.
No, Doug.

06:15.724 --> 06:16.723
No. Nope.
No. No.

06:16.725 --> 06:17.724
Well, think about it.
Kiddies?

06:17.726 --> 06:18.775
My office.
Yeah.

06:18.810 --> 06:20.860
Not you, Miley Cyrus.

06:23.565 --> 06:25.198
Okay.
(clears his throat)

06:25.233 --> 06:27.617
Denna is 100% pulling out.

06:27.652 --> 06:28.902
Huh.
Okay?

06:28.954 --> 06:30.737
So, we got to lock down
these big swinging dicks

06:30.739 --> 06:32.655
that came over in this
acquisition or K and A is

06:32.707 --> 06:34.657
dead in the fucking water.
Grab some cushion.

06:35.827 --> 06:37.410
Clyde?
Yeah?

06:37.462 --> 06:39.162
I'm gonna need you
to get letters of intent

06:39.214 --> 06:40.914
from Craig Smith
and Hannah Choi.

06:40.916 --> 06:42.165
I'm on it.
Okay, Doug?

06:42.217 --> 06:44.751
Work on Tim Brockner,
Mike Jenson.

06:44.753 --> 06:46.252
Mm-hmm.
I've got Jeannie headed

06:46.304 --> 06:48.105
straight out to breakfast
with Rachel Hoffman.

06:48.139 --> 06:50.123
Okay.
And what about Grant Stevens?

06:50.158 --> 06:52.559
Yeah, I'll deal
with that fucknut.

06:52.594 --> 06:54.394
Hmm, wow! Huh.

06:54.429 --> 06:55.678
I love when you
just fucking mumble

06:55.730 --> 06:57.764
when you want somebody
to ask you a ques... What?

06:57.766 --> 07:01.401
Well, in a <i> very</i>
interesting twist...

07:01.436 --> 07:03.403
Yeah, yeah, draw it out.
Clyde and I might

07:03.438 --> 07:05.438
be in a position to help godfather
No, no, no.

07:05.490 --> 07:06.940
the new K and A.

07:06.942 --> 07:08.441
Do you want to tell him, Clyde,
or should I?

07:08.493 --> 07:10.326
Nope, I'm gonna tell him.

07:10.362 --> 07:12.412
Oh, that's no fair.
No, how about you shut the fuck up?

07:12.447 --> 07:13.780
There's nothing to tell. He's...
Yeah, okay.

07:13.782 --> 07:15.331
Yes!
Okay, okay! Yeah.

07:15.367 --> 07:16.616
I probably shouldn't have said...
Jesus, ladies!

07:16.618 --> 07:18.334
Show me your titties.

07:18.370 --> 07:19.919
Our GPS-based doctor
house call app is selling

07:19.955 --> 07:21.871
to a little company
you may have heard of

07:21.923 --> 07:23.506
called Google.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.458
Selling to Google?

07:25.510 --> 07:28.094
Yeah, and as I look
at the comps here,

07:28.129 --> 07:31.180
the low end is in the
vicinity of $400 million.

07:31.216 --> 07:33.049
And the upper end-- and not
at all out of the question--

07:33.101 --> 07:36.603
is a little closer to...

07:36.638 --> 07:38.521
a billion dollars!

07:38.557 --> 07:39.973
We're not making a billion dollars.
We're making a billion dollars!

07:40.025 --> 07:42.025
We are not... Doug, we're not
making a billion dollars!

07:42.060 --> 07:43.393
I'm looking at it!
Oh, my God!

07:43.445 --> 07:45.361
So, you guys could
just single-handedly

07:45.397 --> 07:46.813
finance K and A?

07:46.815 --> 07:47.981
That's exac.. I mean, I'd have
(phone ringing)

07:47.983 --> 07:49.365
to talk to my partner, but yeah.

07:49.401 --> 07:50.950
Well, talk to your
fucking partner.

07:50.986 --> 07:52.819
But I am still gonna
treat you guys like shit.

07:52.821 --> 07:54.487
Wouldn't have it any other way.
Well, then we're definitely in.

07:54.489 --> 07:56.489
Ah!
Are you guys gonna make out?

07:56.491 --> 07:57.991
Get the fuck out of my office!

07:57.993 --> 07:59.993
Okay. Hey, ow!

08:01.463 --> 08:03.496
Hey, buddy.

I'm gonna imagine
it's pretty pricy.

11:43.693 --> 11:45.143
It's $800,000.

11:45.145 --> 11:47.145
Get the fuck out of here.
That's right.

11:47.197 --> 11:50.365

Altshuler pulled out,

fold up my tent

13:48.101 --> 13:50.485
We've got a real problem, here.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.652
Uh-huh.

13:51.688 --> 13:52.937
And what is it?

13:52.939 --> 13:55.573
Well, without being
too explicit,

13:55.608 --> 13:56.941
I think it's pretty clear
who the culprit is.

13:56.993 --> 13:58.159
Is it?

13:58.194 --> 14:00.027
Do you think it's really

14:00.080 --> 14:01.612
"pretty clear," John?

14:03.833 --> 14:05.333
Have a seat, Roscoe.

14:05.368 --> 14:06.617
(quietly):
Dad?

14:08.037 --> 14:10.037
Sit down.

14:12.292 --> 14:13.758
I think what we need to do

14:13.793 --> 14:15.460
is unpack this whole thing.

14:15.462 --> 14:17.628
I mean, really...
really drill down.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.765

we're talking about.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.216
Because I'm wondering...

14:22.268 --> 14:24.685
are you willing
to do the due diligence

14:24.721 --> 14:27.305
that it would take to prove
that Roscoe is the culprit?

14:27.357 --> 14:28.973
Marty...

this whole thing is headed.

14:38.651 --> 14:39.817

14:39.869 --> 14:42.820
Outside law enforcement.

14:42.872 --> 14:44.455
Prosecution of a hate crime.

14:44.491 --> 14:45.857
Trying Roscoe as an adult.

14:45.892 --> 14:47.492
What is that, 15 years?

14:47.494 --> 14:50.995
I mean, John, how many
do you want to scare away?

14:51.047 --> 14:53.998
500 tuition-paying
students?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
A thousand?

14:56.052 --> 14:57.969
I don't even want to get into
what starts happening

14:58.004 --> 14:59.720
if my family gets litigious.

14:59.756 --> 15:01.139
I mean, you've met
his mom, right?

15:01.174 --> 15:02.340
You want to deal with that?

15:05.345 --> 15:08.146

15:08.181 --> 15:10.681

for months and years,

15:10.733 --> 15:13.151
(bell ringing)
John.

15:13.186 --> 15:14.519
Or...

15:16.105 --> 15:19.023
Or...

15:19.075 --> 15:20.691
...the whole thing dies
right now.

15:20.743 --> 15:22.693
Right here.

15:22.745 --> 15:24.078
Right in this room.

15:28.251 --> 15:30.535
One coat of paint...

15:30.537 --> 15:34.088
You'd be surprised
how easily people can forget.

15:38.211 --> 15:39.677
(quietly):
Yeah.

15:39.712 --> 15:41.596
You know...

15:41.631 --> 15:43.548
I think we've all been
through enough.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.849
MARTY:
And I, for one,

15:44.884 --> 15:46.684
am relieved that we have come

15:46.719 --> 15:48.719
to this understanding.

15:50.106 --> 15:51.472
Dad...

15:51.524 --> 15:53.524
Hey. Roscoe, just
hang on a second.

15:55.612 --> 15:57.728
You're doing
the right thing, John.

15:57.730 --> 15:59.063
No, Dad...

15:59.065 --> 16:00.698
I... no.
I just... I...

16:00.733 --> 16:02.400
I just want...

16:02.402 --> 16:04.402
I don't need to be protected.

16:04.437 --> 16:06.038
You need to be careful
right now, Roscoe.

16:06.072 --> 16:07.622
"Be careful"?

16:07.657 --> 16:09.624
Dad, I'm not gonna be careful.

16:10.827 --> 16:12.944
I just... I don't want to lie.

16:12.979 --> 16:14.745
I did a thing

16:14.797 --> 16:16.163
because I was scared.

16:16.216 --> 16:17.582
It was wrong.

16:17.584 --> 16:19.217
And I think
the best thing I can do

16:19.252 --> 16:21.219
just to end this,
is to stop hiding

16:21.254 --> 16:23.754
and admit that that...
is me.

16:25.058 --> 16:26.757
That's me.

16:28.811 --> 16:30.094
So whatever you want to do,

16:30.096 --> 16:31.229
whether that's you prosecute me

16:31.264 --> 16:32.480
or you arrest me,

16:32.515 --> 16:34.398
you should do it.

16:34.434 --> 16:36.434
Because I'm not going to live
the rest of my life

16:36.436 --> 16:38.185
as a liar,

16:38.238 --> 16:40.187
to myself and to anyone else.

16:42.492 --> 16:44.108
I'm not.

16:45.995 --> 16:48.279
Okay.

16:52.619 --> 16:53.618
(liquid splashing)

16:55.038 --> 16:56.654
Oh, fuck me.

16:58.374 --> 17:00.508
It's go time.

17:00.543 --> 17:02.460
(exhales)

17:02.512 --> 17:03.961
(indistinct chatter)

17:03.963 --> 17:06.681
Hey, assholes.

17:06.715 --> 17:10.550
A complete stranger
goes in on us.

17:10.603 --> 17:12.185
Mm.
That's a hostile room.

17:12.221 --> 17:14.188
Yeah.
Well, hostile takeovers can have that effect

17:14.223 --> 17:15.439
on people.
You ever notice

17:15.474 --> 17:16.723
how it doesn't feel as hostile

17:16.776 --> 17:18.276
when you're the ones doing
the taking over?

17:18.310 --> 17:21.145
There's a lot of people in there
that do not love us. Know why?

17:21.196 --> 17:22.363
Fucking Grant Stevens.

17:22.397 --> 17:23.864
Prick. He's poisoning the room.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.616
And he still hasn't signed that
goddamn intent letter either,

17:25.652 --> 17:27.867
but he's fucking gonna.
Excuse me.

17:27.904 --> 17:31.038
No, no, no. Excuse me. We'll have all of those.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

17:31.824 --> 17:33.908
As you were.
Ah...

17:33.960 --> 17:35.209
(Marty burps)

17:35.244 --> 17:36.661
Fuck, where's Jeannie?

17:36.713 --> 17:38.663
We need Jeannie here, man.
It's the wholesome good looks.

17:38.665 --> 17:40.915
They fool people.
She's taking a car. She will be here, okay?

17:40.967 --> 17:42.300
DOUG (chuckles):
Good. "Taking a car."

17:42.335 --> 17:44.302
(chuckles)
I'm not gonna ask you what.

17:44.337 --> 17:46.671
(Clyde groans) Well, since you asked,
spreching of Uber...

17:46.723 --> 17:48.055
Nobody was spreching
of Uber, Doug. Listen,

17:48.091 --> 17:49.811
can you please stop talking in German?
<i>Nein.</i>

17:49.842 --> 17:51.309
I can't.<i> Nein.</i>
Don't say <i> "nein."</i> That's German.

17:51.344 --> 17:54.178
The reason I'm clutching my
phone and Bluetooth is because

17:54.180 --> 17:55.980
any second we're gonna get
the offer on our app,

17:56.015 --> 17:58.349
and then, Marty, my
friend, you can relax

17:58.401 --> 18:00.901
because you will be
strolling down easy street.

18:00.937 --> 18:02.520
Stroll... Don't stroll.
Not like that I won't.

18:02.522 --> 18:04.655
Well, stroll however-however you stroll.
Wait, so...

18:04.691 --> 18:06.991
we are investing in Kaan and
Associates with all of the money

18:07.026 --> 18:08.492
we haven't yet made on the sale?
No.

18:08.528 --> 18:09.610
No offense.
That a problem?

18:09.662 --> 18:10.695
If... Well, if Marty will deal.

18:10.697 --> 18:11.912
And I think he will.
Right, partner?

18:11.948 --> 18:14.081
Douglas, you have to stop, okay?
What?

18:14.117 --> 18:16.367
It... I think it's smart for us to diversify.
Yes, it is.

18:16.369 --> 18:19.286
(phone ringing) Ooh. Oh. Oh, shit.
Okay, this could be them.

18:19.339 --> 18:21.872
(exhales, clears throat)

18:21.924 --> 18:23.624
Yes. Hello, this is
Doug Guggenheim.

18:23.676 --> 18:25.042
How may I help you?

18:25.044 --> 18:27.762
Why are you walking away?
Mm-hmm.

18:27.797 --> 18:30.431
Yeah-huh.
Ooh, glasses.

18:30.466 --> 18:31.882
Your glasses are stupid.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

18:31.884 --> 18:33.084
Uh, goggles, goggles, goggles.
You see what?

18:33.119 --> 18:34.885
Sort of? Half a goggle.
A monocle.

18:34.937 --> 18:37.054
Uh, half, half...
(quietly): It's Google. It's Google.

18:37.056 --> 18:38.723
Why in the world are
we letting him take this call?

18:38.725 --> 18:39.890
I really don't know.
Yes, yes, yes.

18:39.942 --> 18:41.392
I'm authorized to negotiate.

18:41.444 --> 18:42.610
Uh, I'm the numbers guy.

18:43.646 --> 18:44.695
Great.
Okay.

18:44.731 --> 18:47.114
What?
Uh-huh.

18:47.150 --> 18:48.032
$40 million?

18:49.068 --> 18:50.284
$400 million?

18:50.319 --> 18:51.452
$400. That's...
Okay.

18:51.487 --> 18:52.453
No fucking way.
Uh, yes,

18:52.488 --> 18:54.288
that's very interesting.
Very interesting.

18:54.323 --> 18:57.074
Uh... why does that
not sound right?

18:57.076 --> 18:58.626
400. Oh, I know.

18:58.661 --> 19:00.294
It's because I was pulling
a whole bunch of comps

19:00.329 --> 19:01.312
with my peeps today,

19:01.347 --> 19:03.214
and I think the low end

19:03.249 --> 19:05.049
is a little closer
to $800 million.

19:05.084 --> 19:06.751
Doug.
Oh, yeah. Does that shock you?

19:06.803 --> 19:08.886
Well, and I think
you know it, too.

19:08.921 --> 19:10.321
Oh, and while we're
in the vicinity,

19:10.339 --> 19:12.256
why don't we just step on over

19:12.258 --> 19:15.092
to a little place I like to call
Billion Dollar Town?

19:15.094 --> 19:16.260
Oh, shit.

19:16.312 --> 19:17.595
DOUG: That's right--
a billion dollars.

19:17.647 --> 19:19.430
Holy shit.
He's laughing.

19:19.465 --> 19:21.232
We're laughing together.
He's laughing.

19:22.435 --> 19:23.818
Clyde. He's laughing.
DOUG: What do you mean?

19:23.853 --> 19:25.694
DOUG: What do you mean?
What... Say that again.

19:26.656 --> 19:28.439
$400,000?

19:28.491 --> 19:29.657
(stammering):
I don't understand.

19:29.692 --> 19:31.609
You said... you said...
you said 400.

19:31.611 --> 19:33.277
Okay, you were...
you were mumbling.

19:33.279 --> 19:34.662
You were mumbling, so we...

19:34.697 --> 19:37.248
it's not-not entirely
on me, there. That's...

19:37.283 --> 19:38.783
Ah... That is funny.

19:38.835 --> 19:41.168
Stop-stop laughing
for-for-for a second.

19:41.204 --> 19:43.170
Um... okay, well,
h-how about... how about this?

19:43.206 --> 19:45.790
How about we just round it up
to an even $500,000?

19:45.792 --> 19:47.458
Yeah, you go, Mark Zuckerberg.

19:47.510 --> 19:49.677
DOUG: Okay, so you're not
gonna move on that 400?

19:49.712 --> 19:50.878
One second while I...

19:50.930 --> 19:52.263
So, mixed news.

19:52.298 --> 19:54.465
Okay, so $400,000
is a decent margin.

19:54.517 --> 19:56.634
I agree.
And I think the VCs will double down

19:56.636 --> 19:58.102
on our next project.

19:58.137 --> 19:59.353
Exactly.
It's a no-brainer.

19:59.388 --> 20:00.805
A billion.
Who was talking about that?

20:00.857 --> 20:02.139
Let me do it.
Give it. Great.

20:02.191 --> 20:03.224
Okay, yeah, take it home.

20:03.276 --> 20:04.358
I-I messed up a little bit.

20:06.362 --> 20:08.979
DOUG (chuckling): $400,000.
I can't fucking believe it.

20:08.981 --> 20:10.314
Hello?

20:10.366 --> 20:11.982
Hey, do me a favor.

20:12.034 --> 20:13.784
Take your $400,000 offer,

20:13.820 --> 20:15.953
stuff it in one of
your autopiloted cars

20:15.988 --> 20:17.788
and drive it off
a fucking cliff,

20:17.824 --> 20:20.160
- because our app is off
the motherfucking market. - What?

20:20.280 --> 20:21.889
No, it's not. It's...No, it's on the market.
Yes.

20:22.009 --> 20:23.494
We'll do it for 200!
Okay, that was fucking hot.

20:23.546 --> 20:24.829
I'm not gonna do it.

20:24.881 --> 20:27.131
Okay, I'm not gonna
end up like my father

20:27.166 --> 20:29.667
who, at the end of his life,
didn't have a goddamn thing

20:29.669 --> 20:32.052
except for a fucking ugly
cat, an alienated son

20:32.088 --> 20:34.672
and a sticky bun stuck
to the side of his face.

20:34.674 --> 20:36.390
No, you know what?

20:36.425 --> 20:37.508
This is what we're
gonna do, Kelsey.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.760
We're going to launch this app

20:38.761 --> 20:40.511
independently, and then we
are going to sell it

20:40.513 --> 20:42.229
when it is undeniable.

20:42.265 --> 20:43.514
Yeah.

20:43.516 --> 20:45.399
That's what it is, right?
Yeah, I like that.

20:45.434 --> 20:46.851
That's what we do. Yes.
Yeah.

20:46.903 --> 20:48.185
Yeah.
Do you know what I mean?

20:48.187 --> 20:49.353
Yeah, I like it. Yes.
Yes?

20:49.405 --> 20:51.105
Okay.

20:51.157 --> 20:53.274
No!

20:53.326 --> 20:55.826
That could take years!

20:57.697 --> 20:59.530
(groans)
'Cause that was really...

20:59.532 --> 21:01.031
Hey, there.
How you do...?

21:01.083 --> 21:02.416
What is the drug situation here?

21:02.451 --> 21:04.251
Oh, we're gonna take
great care of you.

21:04.287 --> 21:05.536
Okay.
Okay?

21:05.538 --> 21:07.338
Bring me the man
with the needle.

21:07.373 --> 21:08.589
Oh, he's on his way.
Okay?

21:08.624 --> 21:10.457
Okay, I just want you
to breathe right now.

21:10.510 --> 21:12.209
Just breathe.
Okay, you fucking breathe!

21:12.261 --> 21:13.928
Okay, okay.
Okay, just relax. (groaning)

21:13.963 --> 21:15.679
Just relax.
Give me the goddamn drugs!

21:15.715 --> 21:16.714
Okay...

21:16.716 --> 21:17.848
(Jeannie screams)

21:19.602 --> 21:21.802
Oh!

21:22.388 --> 21:23.687
Oh!

21:23.723 --> 21:25.890
Oh, my...
(crowd gasping)

21:27.727 --> 21:29.059
Oh, fuck.

21:29.061 --> 21:30.194
Oh!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

21:30.229 --> 21:31.529
Holy shit.
Marty!

21:31.564 --> 21:32.863
I didn't meant to hit him.

21:32.899 --> 21:34.064
You didn't fucking mean to hit him?
I mean,

21:34.116 --> 21:35.366
I hoped I would,
but I didn't mean

21:35.401 --> 21:36.450
to hit him in the fucking head.

21:36.485 --> 21:37.484
DOUG:
Jesus!

21:37.537 --> 21:39.486
(crowd murmuring)

21:43.626 --> 21:45.242
Okay. (chuckles)

21:45.244 --> 21:47.044
Okay, you motherfucker.

21:47.079 --> 21:49.079
Don't move.
Don't move, Grant.

21:49.131 --> 21:51.081
All right.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.416
Okay.

21:52.468 --> 21:54.418
Just listen.

21:54.470 --> 21:55.586
Everybody just fucking listen.

21:55.638 --> 21:58.088
I'm through trying
to be a nice guy.

21:58.090 --> 21:59.974
Okay? I'm not.

22:00.009 --> 22:01.926
I'm not a nice person,

22:01.978 --> 22:04.311
but I'm good
at what I fucking do.

22:04.347 --> 22:05.846
I'm really, really good at it.

22:05.898 --> 22:07.314
I know what I'm doing.

22:07.350 --> 22:10.434
That's why I went out there
and got all you guys, right?

22:10.436 --> 22:13.070
All your companies
so that we could, together,

22:13.105 --> 22:16.657
be one bigger, better company.

22:16.692 --> 22:19.994
'Cause I know, with you, we can
fucking crush it out there.

22:20.029 --> 22:21.612
I'm gonna make you wealthy.

22:21.664 --> 22:22.997
I'm gonna make you whole.

22:23.032 --> 22:27.117
I will make you better.

22:27.169 --> 22:32.056
But you have to, have to,
have to, have to stick with me.

22:38.264 --> 22:40.598
Look, give me a year.

22:40.633 --> 22:42.299
Can you do that?

22:43.519 --> 22:46.303
Give me... give me one year.

22:46.305 --> 22:51.275
Give me one year
to make you all fucking rich.

22:51.310 --> 22:52.943
CRAIG:
You know what, I can.

22:52.979 --> 22:54.144
I'm in.

22:54.146 --> 22:55.613
WOMAN:
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

22:55.648 --> 22:56.864
MAN:
I'm with you.

22:56.899 --> 22:57.982
WOMAN:
I'm in.

22:58.034 --> 22:59.450
MAN:
Yeah. Let's run with it.

22:59.485 --> 23:02.536
(others murmuring in agreement)

23:02.571 --> 23:04.622
I'm gonna come talk
to you, Grant.

23:04.657 --> 23:06.206
WOMAN: You got it.
MAN: Yeah.

23:06.242 --> 23:08.826
(indistinct crowd chatter)

23:08.828 --> 23:11.829

23:11.881 --> 23:16.050

23:16.085 --> 23:18.802
(indistinct crowd chatter)

23:21.891 --> 23:23.057
Oh, shit.

23:23.092 --> 23:24.391
I didn't mean to.
Holy fuck.

23:24.427 --> 23:26.310
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

23:36.572 --> 23:37.855

Punch him in the fucking...

23:37.857 --> 23:39.239
Marty, listen.
Fucking listen. Listen.

Just fucking listen, Marty.

23:41.277 --> 23:44.028
Marty, guys, tattoo girl, okay?

23:44.080 --> 23:45.329
I'm fucking sorry.

23:45.364 --> 23:47.081
I had a little
too much to drink.

23:47.116 --> 23:48.449
Okay, I just drank too much!

23:48.501 --> 23:49.700

(clears throat)
Holy fuck.

24:01.797 --> 24:03.847
That's a vintage 275.

24:03.883 --> 24:07.885
Yeah, and a '62 Fender Strat,
you fucking shallow prick.

24:07.937 --> 24:09.186
It's all for you.

24:09.221 --> 24:10.688
Is that a fucking 'nough?

24:10.723 --> 24:12.940
Sign this goddamn letter
of intent,

24:12.975 --> 24:15.059
or spend the next
five years of your life

24:15.111 --> 24:16.977
in fucking court
for attempted murder.

24:17.029 --> 24:18.395
Your choice.

24:18.447 --> 24:20.230
What do you want to do?
I'm signing.

24:20.232 --> 24:21.565
No, I would fucking
sign it right now.

24:21.617 --> 24:23.233
I'm s... Okay.
I would fucking sign it right now.

24:23.285 --> 24:24.485
Okay.
Take the pen!

24:24.537 --> 24:25.736
Help him, Doug.
Yeah.

24:25.788 --> 24:27.454
Hurry up.
Sign it, asshole.

24:27.490 --> 24:29.490
Fuck. Okay.

24:35.581 --> 24:37.881
Sorry.

24:37.917 --> 24:39.883
I'm sorry.

24:39.919 --> 24:41.301
The fuckin' car is mine?

24:41.337 --> 24:42.720
(phone rings)
Yeah.

24:42.755 --> 24:45.005
Fuckin' car is yours.

24:45.057 --> 24:46.673
And now I'm gonna borrow it.

24:46.726 --> 24:48.759
You're too fucking drunk
to drive anyway.

24:48.761 --> 24:51.145
Can I at least keep the guitar?

24:51.180 --> 24:54.565
Yeah. Get it.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.817
(laughing)

24:56.852 --> 24:59.436
(engine revving)

25:00.573 --> 25:02.239
Fucking Marty!

25:02.274 --> 25:03.407
(whooping)

25:03.442 --> 25:06.326
Huh? (laughing)

25:06.362 --> 25:07.911
(panting)

25:07.947 --> 25:10.280
No fucking way.

25:10.282 --> 25:11.665
I'm afraid so.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.450
What happened?

25:13.452 --> 25:14.835
Oh!
Oh, don't worry about that. No, no, no, no.

25:14.870 --> 25:16.837
It's okay. I just took
one for the team.

25:16.872 --> 25:18.288
Oh.
Yeah.

25:18.340 --> 25:21.125
(sighs)
But, Marty... the party.

25:22.128 --> 25:23.794
Oh, I rhymed.
Look at that.

25:23.846 --> 25:25.129
You're a poet.

25:25.131 --> 25:26.547
But I didn't know it.

25:26.599 --> 25:28.265
(both laugh, Jeannie gasps)

25:28.300 --> 25:30.100
(Jeannie yells)

25:30.136 --> 25:31.301
Okay. Yup.

25:31.303 --> 25:33.270
(crying):
No!

25:33.305 --> 25:34.688
You're breaking my hand.
Aah!

25:34.723 --> 25:36.807
Just trying
to get your huge-headed child

25:36.859 --> 25:39.193
out my tiny vagina.
Oh, God.

25:39.228 --> 25:40.561
Take it easy, bitch.

25:40.613 --> 25:41.812
I need that.

25:41.814 --> 25:44.148
(groaning and gasping)

25:44.150 --> 25:45.315
Yeah?

25:45.317 --> 25:46.617
(loud breathing)

25:46.652 --> 25:47.985
Just breathe, breathe, breathe.

25:47.987 --> 25:49.153
(groaning)

25:49.155 --> 25:50.320
(exhales)

25:50.322 --> 25:51.655
(exhaling):
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

25:51.657 --> 25:53.490
Yeah. That's good.
(exhales)

25:53.492 --> 25:54.708
Marty...

25:54.743 --> 25:56.160
Hey, listen, listen.
I...

25:56.162 --> 25:58.162
No, no, let me go first.

25:58.164 --> 25:59.663
We did it.
(exhales)

25:59.715 --> 26:00.831
The company.

26:00.833 --> 26:02.166
We saved it.

26:02.218 --> 26:04.835
We fuckin' own it, and
it's gonna be huge, and

26:04.837 --> 26:06.317
you're gonna be
co-president of the...

26:06.338 --> 26:10.507
I took the job...
at Davis/Dexter.

26:11.594 --> 26:13.894
(soft groaning)

26:13.929 --> 26:16.647
(sighing)

26:19.485 --> 26:21.435
Yeah.

26:21.487 --> 26:23.187
You had to.

26:23.239 --> 26:25.522
It's too good to give up, right?

26:25.524 --> 26:27.491
Well... oh, yeah.
Is it coming again?

26:27.526 --> 26:29.026
Oh, yeah. Oh, no.
Okay, I'm gonna

26:29.028 --> 26:30.360
take my hand away for this one.
No, no, no.

26:30.396 --> 26:31.528
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm gonna take my hand...

26:31.530 --> 26:32.996
No, no, no, no, no, no!

26:33.032 --> 26:36.083
(whimpering)
Yup. Mm-hmm.

26:40.756 --> 26:42.589
Hey.

26:42.625 --> 26:44.591
What?

26:44.627 --> 26:47.127
I love you.

26:51.050 --> 26:52.883
(Jeannie screaming)

26:52.918 --> 26:54.885
(baby cooing)

26:59.525 --> 27:00.858
You want to hold her?

27:00.893 --> 27:02.860
Yes.

27:06.982 --> 27:08.899
(baby fussing)

27:08.951 --> 27:11.869
Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

27:14.740 --> 27:16.740
(laughs airily)

27:18.627 --> 27:20.961
(sighs)

27:25.834 --> 27:28.085
Oh.

27:28.137 --> 27:32.256
Well, look at there.

27:32.258 --> 27:34.341
My God.

27:34.393 --> 27:35.726
Look at her.

27:35.761 --> 27:38.262
She's beautiful.

27:38.264 --> 27:39.930
Well, what are you
gonna name her?
