WEBVTT

01:20.863 --> 01:24.301
<i>theCerritos is
beginning a 12-hour warp,</i>

01:24.345 --> 01:27.609
<i>en route to a planetary survey
in the Kontaran system.</i>

01:27.652 --> 01:30.177
<i>With little to do
in this vacant stretch of space,</i>

01:30.220 --> 01:33.702
<i>I've approved some much needed
R and R for the crew.</i>

01:36.183 --> 01:38.010
I can't believe
we all have the day off.

01:38.054 --> 01:39.751
What should we do?
Strategema tournament?

01:39.795 --> 01:41.275
Oh, I can't. Dr. T'Ana

01:41.318 --> 01:42.841
invited me to a thing
on the holodeck.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.495
I really need to get
on her good side.

01:44.539 --> 01:45.757
I can't tell if she likes me

01:45.801 --> 01:46.802
or if she makes that face
at everyone.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.499
Oh, okay. Uh, Rutherford?

01:48.543 --> 01:51.067
Hey, sorry, Billups has
a new soup recipe he asked me

01:51.111 --> 01:53.461
to try out and,
after that, I promised Shaxs

01:53.504 --> 01:54.940
I'd throw some pottery with him.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.855
Jeez, what is this,
commander hangout day?

01:56.899 --> 01:58.683
Huh, guess it's just me and you.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.859
I'm "with the captain" today.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.731
- What do you mean?
- Oh, she's been bugging me to do

02:02.774 --> 02:04.820
some mother/daughter stuff,
and I've been putting it off

02:04.863 --> 02:06.474
forever, and now
with this long haul,

02:06.517 --> 02:08.040
she knows I've got no excuse.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.868
All you guys are spending warp
with a bridge buddy?

02:09.912 --> 02:11.218
It's not a big deal.

02:11.261 --> 02:12.697
Uh, yes, it is!

02:12.741 --> 02:14.134
Socializing with a commander can be

02:14.177 --> 02:15.744
a huge factor
in getting a promotion.

02:15.787 --> 02:17.833
Well, you've got 12 hours,
why don't you rub some elbows

02:17.876 --> 02:18.964
and make a new friend?

02:19.008 --> 02:20.401
I wish I served on a ship

02:20.444 --> 02:22.054
that had built-in
social structures,

02:22.098 --> 02:23.795
like with Binars or Klingons.

02:23.839 --> 02:25.188
Um, have you ever been
on a Klingon ship?

02:25.232 --> 02:27.016
I don't think you'd like it.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.844
They've been
warping around the quadrant

02:28.887 --> 02:30.802
for centuries.
I bet their Lower Decks are

02:30.846 --> 02:32.761
a lot nicer than you'd think.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.209
- Come, M'ach.

02:46.253 --> 02:48.646
Let us eat before
the squirmiest <i>gagh</i> is devoured.

02:48.690 --> 02:50.213
Do not speak of <i>gagh.</i>

02:50.257 --> 02:52.259
Today I am tasked
with scraping out

02:52.302 --> 02:55.566
the worm barrels and
replenishing their blood supply.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.220
That is the worst.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.179
I have combat training all day.

02:59.222 --> 03:01.572
Save me a seat at lunch,
unless I die an honorable death,

03:01.616 --> 03:03.095
then someone else can have it.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.881
Today will be
a day of great honor for me.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.752
I am filling in at the helm.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.537
Yes, the honor is palpable.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.756
Have you not noticed
that Commander Togg

03:11.800 --> 03:13.715
has been undermining
the captain?

03:13.758 --> 03:15.238
If so, then he should be killed.

03:15.282 --> 03:18.023
Exactly, and stationed
at the captain's side,

03:18.067 --> 03:19.764
I will be the logical choice

03:19.808 --> 03:21.592
to be the new first officer.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.725
-"Logical"?

03:23.768 --> 03:25.379
Are you a Vulcan now?

03:25.422 --> 03:28.077
Maybe you should trim your bangs
and join a science vessel.

03:30.035 --> 03:32.951
Could you imagine serving
with those <i>biHnuchs?</i>

03:32.995 --> 03:34.910
"Avoid death, and cower."

03:47.357 --> 03:50.142
Would anyone care
for a game of chess

03:50.186 --> 03:52.493
when we are finished
with our second duty shift?

03:52.536 --> 03:55.800
No. I will be composing
an arrangement for the lute,

03:55.844 --> 03:57.976
which should take several hours.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.240
I am available for chess.

04:00.283 --> 04:01.893
- Hmm.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.940
I have detected an anomalous
surge of metreon particles

04:04.983 --> 04:08.117
in System 7743.8.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.642
System 7743.8 is beyond
our scanning range.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.123
It would be, but I have
implemented personal algorithms,

04:14.166 --> 04:16.299
which increase
our long range sensors.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.822
T'Lyn.

04:17.866 --> 04:21.217
Your assignment was to monitor
tertiary impulse systems.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.958
That is a redundant system.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.394
I wanted to...

04:24.438 --> 04:27.005
It is logical to improve
our scanning capabilities,

04:27.049 --> 04:29.181
instead of observing
non-essential systems.

04:29.225 --> 04:31.662
These readings are
within acceptable parameters.

04:31.706 --> 04:34.361
Correct. However, this region
has never produced this type

04:34.404 --> 04:37.189
of anomalous energy.
Does that not seem... strange?

04:37.233 --> 04:40.018
Anomalies, by definition,
are strange.

04:40.062 --> 04:41.542
Something about this feels off.

04:41.585 --> 04:43.021
"Feels off"?

04:43.065 --> 04:45.372
You have been spoken to
about this before, T'Lyn.

04:45.415 --> 04:46.938
It is illogical
to ignore something

04:46.982 --> 04:48.592
of statistical significance.

04:48.636 --> 04:51.378
I must inform the captain.

04:52.204 --> 04:54.642
She has lost all control.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.648
Today is a good day to be a--

05:02.171 --> 05:04.695
It is you who is dishonorable!

05:04.739 --> 05:06.871
You dare spit lies on my ship?!

05:10.005 --> 05:11.398
Coward! You hide behind

05:11.441 --> 05:13.791
- the name of--
- I hide behind nothing!

05:18.579 --> 05:21.233
Togg forgot what it means
to be Klingon.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.323
I need a loyal first officer,

05:23.366 --> 05:27.239
a soldier of the empire who does
not spit in the face of duty.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.067
The job will go to whoever

05:29.111 --> 05:31.243
impresses me most today.

05:31.287 --> 05:32.593
Remove this.

05:32.636 --> 05:35.987
I don't want that stench
on my bridge.

05:36.031 --> 05:38.163
I will take care of it, Captain.

05:48.435 --> 05:51.394
Okay, let's snag a bridge buddy.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.614
"Kimarnt, her head cloudy"?

05:53.657 --> 05:55.398
Ah, thank you, Ensign...

05:55.442 --> 05:57.618
Boimler. I took a little
Tamarian at the Academy.

05:57.661 --> 06:00.708
Ah, "Unzak and Vhila
as children?"

06:00.751 --> 06:02.449
Oh, uh, right, um--

06:02.492 --> 06:05.582
"Karno, in the forest
with... Mira."

06:05.626 --> 06:08.019
It is hard to lose weight

06:08.063 --> 06:09.978
when you can replicate
any food you want!

06:10.021 --> 06:11.893
No, no, no,
that's not what I meant!

06:11.936 --> 06:14.504
Dang it!

06:18.595 --> 06:21.946
Aw, hey, Boimler. I didn't know
you had a passion for pottery.

06:21.990 --> 06:23.295
Uh, Kayshon and I didn't
really mesh.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.775
Since you have
two bridge buddies,

06:24.819 --> 06:25.950
I thought we could share?

06:25.994 --> 06:27.299
Okie dokie!

06:27.343 --> 06:29.345
Take your never-ending
bonfire of rage

06:29.389 --> 06:31.086
and bury it in the clay.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.566
Get out of here, rage!

06:32.609 --> 06:34.872
That's a neat pot,
Lieutenant Shaxs-- did you learn

06:34.916 --> 06:36.613
how to do that back on Bajor?

06:36.657 --> 06:38.746
What did you just say?

06:38.789 --> 06:41.313
I just asked if you learned
how to throw pots on Bajor.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.359
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, do we not talk about Bajor?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.187
You think I had time

06:45.230 --> 06:46.449
for anything
other than resisting?!

06:46.493 --> 06:49.147
Fighting fascism
is a full-time job!

06:49.191 --> 06:51.149
- Run! He's not kidding!
- Aah!

06:52.673 --> 06:54.718
Put it in the clay, Papa Bear.
Put it in the clay.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.241
I'm going to fight.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.461
I'm going to get revenge. I'm...

06:58.505 --> 07:00.768
going to a make
a cute little ashtray

07:00.811 --> 07:02.422
for my incense.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.554
It's going to look like a puppy.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.513
Ooh, a puppy.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.823
Yes!

07:12.867 --> 07:14.216
Good boy!

07:14.259 --> 07:16.871
That is what we will do
to enemy <i>petaQs.</i>

07:18.916 --> 07:20.309
Drink to honor!

07:20.352 --> 07:23.181
Captain, your targ is
most impressive.

07:23.225 --> 07:24.487
Like Kor's hound

07:24.531 --> 07:26.358
at the Battle
of Klach D'kel Brakt.

07:26.402 --> 07:28.404
Oh, I'm surprised
someone your age

07:28.448 --> 07:30.362
knows of that glorious day.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.234
Oh, it is one
of my favorite slaughters.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.628
We could sing
a song about it, if--

07:36.020 --> 07:38.980
The blood wine barrel
runs low-- fetch us more.

07:39.023 --> 07:41.461
- Yes, sir.

07:43.811 --> 07:47.379
Why would you modify already
adequate long-range sensors,

07:47.423 --> 07:49.469
when that is outside
of your duties?

07:49.512 --> 07:51.253
I had a gut feeling
that increasing

07:51.296 --> 07:52.907
our sensor range
may prove illuminating.

07:52.950 --> 07:55.692
And now you want to adjust
our current heading

07:55.736 --> 07:58.521
by 1.7 degrees,
because of this...

07:58.565 --> 07:59.609
"instinct."

07:59.653 --> 08:01.393
The energy originated
in a region

08:01.437 --> 08:04.005
which has never experienced
a comparable phenomenon.

08:04.048 --> 08:06.268
To ignore it would be illogical.

08:07.443 --> 08:11.273
Helm, adjust course
to 577 mark 6.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.841
Do not take my action
as an endorsement

08:13.884 --> 08:15.320
of your behavior.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.322
You will spend the next two days
in meditation.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.889
No, I do not have time for that.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.152
I have another project,
which is nearing culmination.

08:21.196 --> 08:22.545
T'Lyn, get ahold of yourself.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.504
These outbursts will not be
tolerated.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.897
work on your self-control.

08:26.941 --> 08:28.551
Through silent meditation.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.075
- Captain, I believe that
I could modify the--
- Beliefs,

08:31.119 --> 08:32.512
feelings, instincts.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.775
You are behaving like a child.

08:40.781 --> 08:42.130
You were right, Dr. T.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.653
This is amazing!

08:43.697 --> 08:46.047
Ah, nothing like clawing
your way up the side

08:46.090 --> 08:48.571
of a giant, hard piece
of earth to feel alive.

08:48.615 --> 08:51.574
Boimler!
What are you doing up here?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.707
Just wanted to catch up
in the old hover boots and see

08:53.750 --> 08:56.361
if you guys needed a climbing
partner-- Hi, Dr. T'Ana.

08:56.405 --> 08:58.059
You didn't bring any gear?

08:58.102 --> 09:00.583
Well, uh, I-I-I have the shirt
and, uh, you know, the boots.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.328
Good thing safety protocols
are on.

09:06.371 --> 09:08.199
They-they are on, right?

09:08.243 --> 09:10.419
I don't know. Sure.

09:10.462 --> 09:13.161
Ow, ow, ow!

09:19.471 --> 09:21.473
Hmm.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.475
Why would you tell
an entire shift

09:23.519 --> 09:25.260
I get bad cramps?!

09:25.303 --> 09:27.044
You were on duty!

09:27.088 --> 09:29.569
Your commanding officers have
to know any medical issues

09:29.612 --> 09:31.353
that could impact the mission!

09:31.396 --> 09:32.963
Billups doesn't need to know!

09:33.007 --> 09:35.313
He's not good with that stuff,
it freaked him out!

09:35.357 --> 09:37.272
If I had to dance around
everything that freaks out

09:37.315 --> 09:38.969
Billups, we wouldn't get
anything done!

09:39.013 --> 09:41.581
Cool! Then maybe I'll tell him
to boost the environmental

09:41.624 --> 09:43.844
controls to help
with your hot flashes!

09:50.590 --> 09:53.462
Oh, nothing
like that Hawaiian surf.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.029
Crisp air, tasty waves.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.031
- This is gonna be great.
- Sir.

09:57.074 --> 10:00.295
Ensign. Oh, you remember
those luaus, on the beach?

10:00.338 --> 10:02.514
- Ah, so good!
- Yeah, friggin' pigs, dude!

10:02.558 --> 10:04.516
Nothing like the feel
of Hawaiian sand

10:04.560 --> 10:06.606
after riding
those tropical waves.

10:06.649 --> 10:09.652
Mr. Boimler,
are you also from Hawaii?

10:09.696 --> 10:11.828
From-from Hawaii? Oh, uh...

10:11.872 --> 10:14.396
He has to be-- only people
who grew up on the islands

10:14.439 --> 10:16.354
like us could describe it
like that.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.965
You're all from Hawaii?

10:18.008 --> 10:19.357
Um, aloha!

10:19.401 --> 10:20.794
Yep, small galaxy, huh?

10:20.837 --> 10:23.274
I can't believe there's
another Hawaiian onboard!

10:23.318 --> 10:24.885
We're hitting the beach
this afternoon.

10:24.928 --> 10:27.017
Holodeck Three--
you should join us.

10:27.061 --> 10:28.671
To clean up or...

10:28.715 --> 10:30.760
No, to hang out!

10:30.804 --> 10:32.675
Unless you don't miss
the islands?

10:32.719 --> 10:35.460
No, I mean, yeah, I mean,
I am homesick for Hawaii.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.289
I grew up in Hawaii
and, man, do I miss Hawaii.

10:38.333 --> 10:41.205
- Wait, didn't you say
you're from a vineyard?
- Uh...

10:41.249 --> 10:43.425
- Pineapple or coffee?
- Both?

10:43.468 --> 10:46.646
Whoa! Now that's tropical.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.740
Next time, fetch your own wine.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.875
I demand assistance.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.008
Could someone just--

11:01.051 --> 11:03.271
Captain, ah, yes, I thank you.

11:03.314 --> 11:05.055
I cannot move this overweight...

11:05.099 --> 11:07.405
When you're done
fooling around, walk my targ.

11:07.449 --> 11:10.234
He ate that traitor's leg, and
will need to be shuffled around

11:10.278 --> 11:12.933
until it passes,
or he will have gas.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.979
Yes, sir.

11:26.947 --> 11:29.384
You are working
instead of meditating.

11:29.427 --> 11:30.907
I am nearly finished.
I will meditate

11:30.951 --> 11:32.604
as soon
as the project is complete.

11:32.648 --> 11:34.215
You know
your rebellions will only

11:34.258 --> 11:35.651
lead to punitive spiritualism.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.305
I am not rebellious.

11:37.348 --> 11:40.438
I simply am enjoying the project
and hoped to finish it today

11:40.482 --> 11:42.440
so I can continue
with other work.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.616
Perhaps if you did not
spend all of your time

11:44.660 --> 11:46.749
following rules,
you, too, would appreciate

11:46.793 --> 11:49.273
that there is more for us
to learn and achieve.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.971
Are you attempting to insult me?

11:51.014 --> 11:52.929
I merely wish for you
to join me in broadening

11:52.973 --> 11:54.888
your definition of how
to synthesize data.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.759
That sounds
like an insult to me.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.066
Perhaps you could look to me
as your confidant.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.198
In Klingon culture,
they designate those who stand

12:01.242 --> 12:02.634
with one another as <i>cha'DIch.</i>

12:02.678 --> 12:04.288
We are not Klingon.

12:04.332 --> 12:05.768
Nor are we Borg drones.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.770
We do not have
to blindly follow orders.

12:07.814 --> 12:10.686
"Logic is the beginning
of wisdom, not the end."

12:10.730 --> 12:13.123
The high command would be
most interested to learn

12:13.167 --> 12:14.951
of your relaxed attitude.

12:14.995 --> 12:17.127
How would they find out?
Would you report me?

12:17.171 --> 12:20.130
If it is for your own good.
You are clearly unstable.

12:20.174 --> 12:22.089
You are not yourself, T'Lyn.

12:22.132 --> 12:24.482
- Everyone has noticed.
- Then I hope they notice

12:24.526 --> 12:27.094
how unconcerned I am
about their assessment.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.489
Why didn't you just tell them
you're not from Hawaii?

12:31.533 --> 12:33.622
I tried! Sort of.
It all just happened fast!

12:33.665 --> 12:35.493
Suddenly I was just part
of the <i>ohana.</i>

12:35.537 --> 12:38.235
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- Yeah, but what if Ransom
finds out I lied?

12:38.279 --> 12:40.150
He could demote me to work
at a penal colony where

12:40.194 --> 12:42.892
I'd have to mate with the enemy
to form a new civilization...

12:42.936 --> 12:45.329
<i>Ensign Mariner, report
to my quarters for hanging out.</i>

12:46.853 --> 12:50.160
This is the longest warp
of my life!

12:54.034 --> 12:55.339
I don't know, Boimler.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.819
I think you should
just come clean.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.299
Yeah, I mean what's really

12:58.342 --> 13:01.084
having a commander friend
or being true to yourself?

13:01.128 --> 13:03.826
Yeah, yeah. You're right.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.350
Aloha!

13:06.394 --> 13:08.657
Hey, hey! Aloha!

13:24.325 --> 13:26.196
Captain,
the leg has been passed.

13:26.240 --> 13:27.632
It was an honorable movement.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.505
The empire used
to choke the quadrant

13:30.548 --> 13:33.464
with fear, power, but now?

13:33.508 --> 13:35.205
We've lost our way.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.859
The empire still strikes terror.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.557
Klingon blood runs
as reddish-pink as ever.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.255
Klingons joining Starfleet.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.126
Studying at Bajoran academies.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.085
No hunger for victory.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.869
No respect for tradition.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.132
It is troubling to see
a proud caste of warriors

13:49.176 --> 13:51.047
lose their <i>lurDech.</i>

13:51.091 --> 13:52.788
Well put.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.486
You are a true Klingon.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.619
You may be smaller and weaker

13:57.662 --> 14:00.230
and slower and smaller
than my other officers.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.015
But you have a warrior's spirit.

14:02.058 --> 14:05.235
One day, you could be
captain of your own ship.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.542
That would be
my greatest honor, sir.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.152
Uh, besides dying in battle.

14:09.196 --> 14:11.938
<i>That</i> would be
my greatest-greatest honor.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.548
<i>Captain, we're being hailed.</i>

14:13.591 --> 14:15.289
Put it in my quarters.
Private channel.

14:15.332 --> 14:17.508
- Pakled!
- Oh, hi.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.771
Are you ready
to give us presents?

14:19.815 --> 14:22.165
We will discuss
our transaction in person.

14:22.209 --> 14:24.254
I'm beaming over with my new

14:24.298 --> 14:25.603
second-in-command.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.344
Thank you, Captain.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.781
Pah, Pakleds have no honor.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.871
Are we commandeering their ship?

14:31.914 --> 14:35.396
Even cowards
and fools have their uses.

14:35.439 --> 14:36.919
I do not understand.

14:36.963 --> 14:39.139
Pakleds have
an insatiable hunger for power.

14:39.182 --> 14:40.749
I can use that.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.707
With the weapons and information
I've armed them with,

14:42.751 --> 14:45.406
they've thrown the entire
quadrant into discord.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.060
You are helping them?

14:47.103 --> 14:49.018
With the Federation
destabilized,

14:49.062 --> 14:51.673
the empire can claim
the region as our own.

14:51.716 --> 14:54.110
Our greatest day is yet to come.

14:54.154 --> 14:56.939
Klingons do not allow someone
else to fight our battles.

14:56.983 --> 14:59.855
Which is exactly
why the Federation

14:59.899 --> 15:02.684
has no idea
who is manipulating them.

15:02.727 --> 15:07.036
"Cry havoc
and let slip the dogs of war."

15:10.170 --> 15:11.519
I think it was the chef,

15:11.562 --> 15:12.955
in the bio lab,
with a sniper rifle

15:12.999 --> 15:14.304
that can shoot through walls.

15:14.348 --> 15:16.089
You always pick the chef.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.655
Yeah, 'cause we have
replicators.

15:17.699 --> 15:18.961
Why is there a chef?
That's just shady.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.615
<i>Captain, we've picked up</i>

15:20.658 --> 15:22.051
<i>an anomalous
energy reading nearby.</i>

15:22.095 --> 15:23.487
<i>Should we drop out of warp
and investigate?</i>

15:23.531 --> 15:24.793
- Yes!
- Yes, please!

15:24.836 --> 15:26.490
All right,
let's get back to work.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.318
Ooh, I cannot believe
I'm saying that.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.146
- Mariner.
- What? I know.

15:30.190 --> 15:32.148
I don't care
who the fake killer was.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.324
I had a good time today.

15:34.368 --> 15:35.978
I know.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.588
I did, too.

15:41.897 --> 15:45.335
Welcome to the Pakled
spaceship, <i>Pakled.</i>

15:45.379 --> 15:46.771
I am Rebner.

15:46.815 --> 15:49.252
Ah, yes, Rebner,
we've met several times.

15:49.296 --> 15:50.688
We need another boomer.

15:50.732 --> 15:53.169
What? No, one Varuvian bomb
is enough.

15:53.213 --> 15:54.518
We already used it.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.259
You used it?! On what? Why?

15:56.303 --> 15:58.653
We wanted to test it
on a big asteroid,

15:58.696 --> 16:00.742
but then it stopped working.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.439
It was a bomb!

16:02.483 --> 16:04.093
You can only use it once!

16:04.137 --> 16:06.791
This is Dorg.
Transport another explosive

16:06.835 --> 16:08.532
- onto the Pakled vessel. <i>
- Yes, Captain.</i>

16:08.576 --> 16:11.709
Captain, a Varuvian explosion
would emit metreon particles.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.885
- Other ships may come
to investigate.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.105
<i>Red alarm. Red alarm.</i>

16:23.634 --> 16:25.375
Damn it!
Block their communications!

16:25.419 --> 16:27.899
We have to take out that ship!

16:27.943 --> 16:29.858
What the-- The Pakleds again?

16:29.901 --> 16:31.381
And now
they're threatening Klingons?

16:31.425 --> 16:32.730
Hail the Bird-of-Prey.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.210
No response, Captain.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.385
Klingon ship, this is

16:35.429 --> 16:37.039
the Federation
Starship <i>Cerritos.</i>

16:37.083 --> 16:38.736
We've dealt with Pakleds before.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.738
Are you in need of aid?

16:42.349 --> 16:44.612
Captain, both vessels
are powering weapons.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.744
What?! Shields up! Red alert!

16:50.052 --> 16:52.620
- Dude, my Mai Tai.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.404
Hawaiianers,
we're under attack!

17:03.631 --> 17:06.112
Target their weapons!

17:07.026 --> 17:09.202
- Shields holding at 80%.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.294
Return fire! Full spread!

17:16.122 --> 17:18.254
Deck Six is taking heavy damage.

17:18.298 --> 17:19.386
Sealing the area.

17:19.429 --> 17:21.736
Damn it!
We have to get to the bridge!

17:21.779 --> 17:23.825
I don't want to die
in a Hawaiian shirt.

17:24.739 --> 17:27.176
I'm not from Hawaii.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.612
And if I don't make it
through this,

17:28.656 --> 17:29.918
I don't want to die a liar.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.659
Sir, I'm from Modesto,
California.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.313
I just wanted
to find a bridge buddy.

17:33.356 --> 17:34.618
I-I'm sorry.

17:34.662 --> 17:37.317
I'm not from Hawaii, either.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.798
I never felt like I belonged,
until I met the rest of you.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.365
Neither am I. None of us are.

17:42.409 --> 17:44.019
We just wanted to be friends
with you, sir.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.108
You guys didn't have to pretend

17:46.152 --> 17:48.806
to be something you aren't.
I like you for you.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.156
Really? Thanks, Commander.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.854
- Also, I'm not from Hawaii.
- Wait, what now?

17:52.897 --> 17:54.247
I made it up
when I was an ensign

17:54.290 --> 17:56.510
and my commanding officer
was from Honolulu.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.860
I'm actually from the Moon.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.557
Wait, bro, Earth's moon?

18:00.601 --> 18:02.559
That's where I'm from! Luna Bay!

18:02.603 --> 18:05.171
- Tyco City!
- My sister went
to Tyco City Prep!

18:05.214 --> 18:07.129
I'm from
the Third Moon of Benzar!

18:07.173 --> 18:09.305
B-9-3? That's a great moon!

18:09.349 --> 18:10.698
My cousin lives there!

18:10.741 --> 18:12.134
We're all moon buddies?

18:12.178 --> 18:14.136
You know, some people say
Modesto is like the moon

18:14.180 --> 18:16.834
of, uh, San Francisco,
so I guess I'm from a moon, too.

18:16.878 --> 18:18.880
Modesto is not a moon.

18:18.923 --> 18:20.795
If you were from a moon,
you'd know

18:20.838 --> 18:22.449
how deeply insulting that is.

18:22.492 --> 18:24.364
What? You guys pretended
to be from Hawaii!

18:24.407 --> 18:26.322
- That's like the most
culturally insensitive--

18:28.411 --> 18:30.587
Let the Pakleds take
the final shot.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.633
They're about to start a war.

18:32.676 --> 18:34.156
This feels wrong.
There is no honor

18:34.200 --> 18:36.550
in letting others fight
our battles.

18:36.593 --> 18:38.334
Do not talk to me of honor!

18:38.378 --> 18:40.554
I have been crushing <i>baktags
beneath my boot</i>

18:40.597 --> 18:43.165
since before you were born!

18:43.209 --> 18:46.690
Other Klingons have tried
to sabotage peace before.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.171
- They failed.
- I will not.

18:49.215 --> 18:52.392
They will write songs of me
this day!

19:00.095 --> 19:03.490
<i>Red alarm! Red alarm! Red alarm!</i>

19:03.533 --> 19:05.579
I am hungry.

19:05.622 --> 19:07.276
You should eat.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.799
You are smart.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.323
<i>Red alarm!</i>

19:10.366 --> 19:12.238
Evasive maneuvers!

19:14.849 --> 19:16.285
Shields at 17%!

19:16.329 --> 19:18.505
Captain, we can't last
much longer!

19:24.598 --> 19:26.730
Captain, we are being fired upon

19:26.774 --> 19:28.863
by Klingons and Pakleds.

19:28.906 --> 19:31.257
Curious.
Shields to maximum power.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.530
The Pakleds appear
to have Klingon weaponry.

19:45.619 --> 19:47.882
Primary shields are failing.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.840
Captain, the project
I have been working on is

19:49.884 --> 19:51.581
a regenerative shield amplifier.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.104
I believe it may help.

19:53.148 --> 19:55.019
This has not been tested.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.238
If it damages the coupling,

19:56.282 --> 19:57.979
we would be left unprotected.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.850
It is logical to use it now,

19:59.894 --> 20:02.549
considering there are
no alternatives.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.816
My instinct tells me

20:08.859 --> 20:10.470
it will work.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.995
Implement the program.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.782
Yes, yes!

20:18.826 --> 20:20.697
The destruction
of two enemy ships

20:20.741 --> 20:23.004
will bring me much glory.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.484
These are not our enemies.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.790
Does the high council know
of your actions?

20:26.834 --> 20:28.662
The high council lacks
foresight.

20:28.705 --> 20:31.708
They will change their minds
when the battle begins.

20:31.752 --> 20:34.145
Shields are... increasing.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.147
This is highly improbable,
Captain.

20:36.191 --> 20:37.801
They are now at 120%.

20:37.845 --> 20:40.369
Disable the Pakled ship.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.855
Target the Federation ship!

20:47.898 --> 20:49.335
Belay that order.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.772
- What?
- This is not our fight.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.948
This lunacy must end.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.996
Ha! You dare challenge me?

20:59.040 --> 21:01.564
Stop the attack.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.479
- Finish them!
- No!

21:20.279 --> 21:22.411
- Stupid targ!

21:26.023 --> 21:27.503
Ah!

21:40.908 --> 21:43.563
What are your orders, Captain?

21:47.001 --> 21:49.351
Set a course for the homeworld.

21:49.395 --> 21:52.659
The council can decide
what to do with this <i>biHnuch.</i>

21:55.575 --> 21:58.186
Captain, the Klingon
ship is retreating!

21:58.229 --> 22:00.101
Well, then,
let's give the Pakleds

22:00.144 --> 22:03.017
- a taste of their own mushfroot.
- Yes, sir!

22:26.823 --> 22:28.869
Hail the Vulcans.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.914
Thanks for the hand, Captain.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.264
For a minute there, we were
in a little over our...

22:33.308 --> 22:34.701
Do you require assistance?

22:34.744 --> 22:37.399
I think we're okay over here,
we were just...

22:37.443 --> 22:38.922
Excellent, then
with the threat neutralized,

22:38.966 --> 22:40.707
no further communication
is necessary.

22:41.490 --> 22:44.101
Well, isn't he a ton of fun?
Assess the damage.

22:44.145 --> 22:45.755
Let's begin repairs.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.366
Klingons helping Pakleds?

22:47.409 --> 22:50.281
Well, I guess now we know
how they got all those weapons.

22:50.325 --> 22:52.327
Strange how they broke off
and retreated, though.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.721
Klingons typically want
to die in battle.

22:54.764 --> 22:56.462
Honestly, I get it.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.855
It's almost like they decided

22:58.899 --> 23:01.510
- it wasn't their fight.
- Captain?

23:01.554 --> 23:03.338
We need to brief
Starfleet Command.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.818
They're gonna have
a lot to discuss

23:04.861 --> 23:06.472
with the Klingon high council.

23:13.217 --> 23:15.437
We are fortunate
that your shield program worked.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.005
If you had not been
"following your instinct,"

23:18.048 --> 23:20.007
it is unlikely we would have

23:20.050 --> 23:22.313
- survived that encounter.
- I concur.

23:22.357 --> 23:24.098
However,
your inability to control

23:24.141 --> 23:25.447
your emotions is a liability.

23:25.491 --> 23:27.449
I am removing you from duty.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.408
Captain, I believe
you are making an error.

23:29.451 --> 23:32.193
Your perceived victory today
will only serve as fuel

23:32.236 --> 23:33.760
for further impulsivity.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.805
There is no place
for that on this starship.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.155
I will gather my personal items

23:38.199 --> 23:40.201
and prepare to return to Vulcan.

23:40.244 --> 23:42.812
- You will not be
returning to Vulcan.
- Curious.

23:42.856 --> 23:45.119
I am recommending you
for reassignment...

23:45.162 --> 23:47.426
to a Starfleet vessel.
Your hotheaded ways

23:47.469 --> 23:50.167
may make you better suited
to serve with humans.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.213
Captain,
I ask that you reconsider.

23:52.256 --> 23:54.476
I do not believe
this punishment is warranted.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.347
And that is exactly
the type of outburst

23:56.391 --> 23:58.088
which led to my decision.

23:58.132 --> 24:00.177
It is final.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.006
Live long and prosper.

24:03.050 --> 24:04.704
Sir.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.099
<i>They're all from moons!</i>

24:09.143 --> 24:11.841
Look at them, probably talking
about tides and werewolves.

24:11.885 --> 24:13.495
I was so close!

24:13.539 --> 24:15.497
I know you really wanted
to have a bridge buddy,

24:15.541 --> 24:18.108
But guess what? You don't
need them-- you've got us.

24:18.152 --> 24:19.545
Next time we have
a long-haul warp,

24:19.588 --> 24:21.242
I vote we all do
something together, cool?

24:21.285 --> 24:22.504
- You know it!
- Cool!

24:22.548 --> 24:24.114
You're right. Thanks, guys.

24:24.158 --> 24:26.203
I appreciate it.

24:27.248 --> 24:29.250
E-Excuse me?

24:29.293 --> 24:30.947
Ensign Boimler, sir?

24:30.991 --> 24:33.646
- Huh? Yeah, uh, yeah, that's me.
- Well, I've been having trouble

24:33.689 --> 24:35.169
keeping up
with my duty schedule.

24:35.212 --> 24:36.562
Commander Ransom
said that you're

24:36.605 --> 24:38.477
the most organized person
on the ship.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.435
- He did?
- Yeah, he says you're great,

24:40.479 --> 24:42.655
and I should pick your brain,
if that's okay.

24:42.698 --> 24:44.047
I mean, yes! Of course!

24:44.091 --> 24:45.701
Yeah, glad to help. Sure.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.094
Oh, thank you, sir!

24:47.137 --> 24:48.878
- I really admire your work!
- Let's talk duties.

24:48.922 --> 24:51.272
Every ship in the fleet
depends on officers like us

24:51.315 --> 24:52.708
to keep them running.

24:52.752 --> 24:55.232
The bridge crew is maybe
the ones you hear about.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.060
<i>But trust me, the real action</i>

24:57.104 --> 24:59.367
<i>begins on the lower decks.</i>
