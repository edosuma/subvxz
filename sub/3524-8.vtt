01:44.904 --> 01:49.398
Here, I made it with a lot of milk and sugar.
It's more comforting that way.

01:51.044 --> 01:54.775
You sure you don't want some eggs
or an English or something?

01:55.682 --> 01:57.411
You're coming back?

01:58.251 --> 02:01.118
I hope so. Immigration, they make problems.

02:01.421 --> 02:03.355
Maybe Tony can help with that.

02:03.990 --> 02:05.116
Yeah.

02:05.658 --> 02:09.150
What are you doing here?
I thought you were flying out to Naples.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.789
I just dropped off these shirts
from Patsy's guy.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.390
But you should be on your way
to see your old man.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.264
Cancer is everywhere in his body.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.133
Cancer don't respect nothing.

02:18.204 --> 02:21.503
- You know, it started in his guts.
- Do you need any money?

02:22.909 --> 02:24.171
I'm good.

02:24.611 --> 02:26.670
Please call and let us know.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.543
I'm sorry, Tony.

02:30.783 --> 02:33.411
You'll have to get somebody else
to drive you tonight.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.147
Not a problem. Go.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.249
You think he wears a bag?

02:40.827 --> 02:42.055
Who wears what?

02:42.128 --> 02:43.993
You know, a colostomy bag.

02:44.197 --> 02:47.189
- Furio's old man.
- How the fuck would I know that?

02:47.267 --> 02:51.431
Because my ma, maybe, maybe not,
has to get one.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.335
Could we not talk about this?

02:53.406 --> 02:55.772
We could talk about any topic you like, T.

02:55.842 --> 02:56.934
Good.

02:57.810 --> 03:01.109
It's just that now with Ma all squared away
to go to Green Grove...

03:01.181 --> 03:04.639
For fuck's sake, Paulie,
everybody's gonna get old and die.

03:09.889 --> 03:12.653
- Am I driving you tomorrow, too?
- No, I'll drive myself.

03:12.725 --> 03:13.987
I got nothing else to do.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.460
I got a very important meeting, that's all.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.497
It's a delicate situation.

03:23.603 --> 03:25.833
We lucked out with the weather.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.641
So, how's the life of leisure?

03:30.109 --> 03:31.667
Playing golf, ain't I?

03:33.580 --> 03:34.945
Cocksucker.

03:39.919 --> 03:44.185
Seriously, it's good you're pulling back
business-wise like we agreed.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.115
My nephew, I told him.

03:46.192 --> 03:49.628
I'm gonna be speaking through him,
and only through him, as time passes.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.323
- Good.
- Plus Sil.

03:53.099 --> 03:56.000
I don't want to celebrate
my daughter's first kid in prison.

04:02.342 --> 04:05.470
All right, this sit-down in Perth Amboy.
Get a pen and paper.

04:05.545 --> 04:06.739
Hold on.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.745
<i>I can't find a piece of paper.</i>

04:16.022 --> 04:17.011
Shoot.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.753
Tell Paulie to let Patsy run the car operation
while Furio's gone.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.658
<i>Tel Patsy he's got to kick up 10 points.</i>

04:22.729 --> 04:25.425
<i>Seven and a half to me,
two and half to Paulie.</i>

04:25.498 --> 04:26.522
Got it.

04:26.599 --> 04:30.057
You and Sil, you figure out
who pays the Longshore Union how much.

04:30.136 --> 04:32.161
I'll back you up whichever.

04:33.806 --> 04:35.137
What the fuck?

04:36.342 --> 04:38.071
<i>- I'm on it.
- All right.</i>

05:10.076 --> 05:12.567
- A simple yes or no will do.
- Please.

05:15.715 --> 05:18.513
- Artie, hi, how are things?
- Fine.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.051
Did they ever catch those muggers?

05:22.855 --> 05:24.482
Did you leave room for dessert?

05:24.557 --> 05:28.323
We'll have one zabaglione and four spoons.
Coffees, all around.

05:31.397 --> 05:33.991
Bri', can I ask you
a financial-related question?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.331
The last thing the guy wants to do
is talk shop.

05:36.402 --> 05:39.530
Ask him anything you want.
It's all he likes to talk about.

05:39.605 --> 05:40.936
It's no big thing.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.407
Any ideas on what Tony and I should do...

05:43.476 --> 05:46.206
with the proceeds
from the property in Newark we sold?

05:46.279 --> 05:47.746
- A HUD?
- What?

05:48.247 --> 05:51.876
Kid loves Paul Newman movies.
No more grappa for you.

05:52.118 --> 05:53.608
You know what I'm talking about.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.813
Uncle Junior's lot on Frelinghuysen Avenue.

05:55.888 --> 05:58.516
Yeah, that. It all went into the trust.

05:58.791 --> 06:02.522
T- bills, I was able to lock you in
before the rates dropped.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.124
What doesn't this kid know about money?

06:06.232 --> 06:08.462
You know, I trust him 1,000 percent?

06:11.270 --> 06:12.601
Thank you.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.672
- We have so many more of the newborn size.
- I think they're cheaper.

06:17.343 --> 06:19.607
Next year we could put a notice
in the bulletin...

06:19.679 --> 06:23.137
that people whose last names
begin with "A" to "K" bring the newborns...

06:23.216 --> 06:26.481
and "L" to "Z" bring the bigger ones,
or vice versa.

06:26.552 --> 06:30.215
Whatever we give them, the girls
at our ladies' shelter should be grateful.

06:30.289 --> 06:33.452
I mean, nobody told them
to go and have babies without husbands.

06:36.863 --> 06:40.264
I remember his charity toward my family
when Jack died.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.801
I didn't know how to pay the phone bill.
Jackie always did everything.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.735
- There you go.
- Thank you.

06:46.272 --> 06:47.534
I pay bills...

06:48.474 --> 06:51.102
but other than that, it's the same with Tony.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.708
Try to find out where the money is...

06:53.780 --> 06:56.613
how much we have,
and I get such resistance.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.185
I didn't know what we had
until after I buried Jackie.

07:00.853 --> 07:02.150
Was it enough?

07:03.656 --> 07:04.782
Sort of.

07:06.292 --> 07:07.520
Not really.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.121
How much is enough, anyway?

07:11.798 --> 07:13.823
I don't know, that's my point.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.959
Doesn't anything ever change?

07:16.102 --> 07:18.434
Women are supposed to be
partners nowadays.

07:18.504 --> 07:21.803
I'm not a feminist,
I'm not saying 50-50, but Jesus.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.711
<i>You know, I put up with cumare shit.
Pardon my French.</i>

07:26.045 --> 07:28.639
I made my peace with it,
best I could, anyway.

07:28.714 --> 07:31.046
Isn't your cousin Brian
handling your money now?

07:31.117 --> 07:34.553
The big things, the investments.
He's doing well, too.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.554
You know,
I do have to give Tony credit there.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.784
He did meet me halfway with that,
God bless him.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.759
Which was a very big step for him, I know.

07:41.828 --> 07:44.888
- Maybe you have nothing to worry about.
- I don't know.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.092
Tony pulls people into his circle.
I don't know what to think.

07:49.836 --> 07:51.133
Good girl.

07:52.738 --> 07:53.966
Titanium?

07:54.106 --> 07:57.405
The track's freezing up,
it's too hard for aluminum.

07:58.077 --> 08:01.535
Whatever she's got on those feet,
she's a winner.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.374
A little colicky?

08:06.486 --> 08:09.216
You don't feel good, baby girl?
You bad girl.

08:09.288 --> 08:11.620
Fuck this horse-whispering shit.

08:16.596 --> 08:18.359
What is this costing us?

08:19.298 --> 08:20.765
Tony, Valentina.

08:22.468 --> 08:26.427
She works in an art gallery.
Helping me to enlarge my collection.

08:28.474 --> 08:31.671
And this, my chiquita banana, is Pie-O-My.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.272
She's beautiful.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.975
There's no stopping this horse.
She's gonna go all the way to the Breeders'.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.539
We'll do the two geldings next.

08:39.619 --> 08:43.248
Hon, can you come here a sec?
I think I have something in my eye.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.250
Let Dr. Ralphie have a look.

08:50.763 --> 08:53.960
- I don't see anything.
- Maybe you need more light.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.465
What the fuck?

09:00.406 --> 09:03.933
- I can't believe you did this to me.
- It was a joke, hon.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.341
There's nothing funny about it.

09:05.411 --> 09:06.901
There is from where I'm standing.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.742
Besides, it's good luck.

09:09.615 --> 09:12.709
- What?
- It's good luck to step in horseshit.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.250
- Ask any horse person.
- It's true.

09:15.321 --> 09:17.516
Then why aren't you people
walking around...

09:17.590 --> 09:19.854
looking for piles of horseshit
to stomp around in?

09:19.926 --> 09:23.487
- It only works if it's an accident.
- Fucking sick, all of you.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.560
Fucko, where's a hose?

09:33.539 --> 09:37.441
You know, it can be risky trusting him
to have a sense of humor.

09:37.543 --> 09:38.874
Did you think it was funny?

09:38.945 --> 09:42.506
Yeah, but what I think is funny
is what an 8-year-old boy thinks is funny.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.482
Having any fun yourself?

09:44.951 --> 09:46.612
What, you taking a survey?

09:46.686 --> 09:49.553
- Have any interest in art?
- Show the right thing, I do.

09:49.622 --> 09:52.819
There's an artist down in New Hope,
specializes in horses.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.656
Give him a photo of your horse,
he paints a lovely portrait.

09:55.728 --> 09:57.161
It'd look great in your office.

09:57.229 --> 09:59.629
Have a look at my office
before you make that call.

09:59.699 --> 10:00.723
Think about it.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.394
If you're interested, give me a call.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.235
"La Paz. " What's that, Puerto Rican?

10:09.408 --> 10:12.775
<i>Cubana. My mother was Italian,
my father Cuban.</i>

10:12.845 --> 10:14.904
What a dangerous combination.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.681
She gorgeous or what?

10:24.223 --> 10:25.520
Sweet as sugar.

10:29.595 --> 10:32.826
If there's anything you need,
you just press this button.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.662
- Which one?
- This one that I'm showing you.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.265
Safety first.

10:37.336 --> 10:39.463
A friend of yours, Mrs. Cirillo,
might stop by.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.098
She wanted to see you
before you went down for lunch.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.471
Cookie.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.078
Look, just like home.

10:51.283 --> 10:54.184
They're gonna wait on you hand and foot
around here.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.645
Put the boxes in the closet.

10:56.722 --> 10:59.452
And go get the TV. The both of you carry it.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.389
Come on, cowgirl.

11:02.461 --> 11:06.022
Let's go down to the chuck wagon
and see what they're rustling up.

11:07.967 --> 11:11.960
- Paulie, did they bring my bathmat?
- For the fifth time, Ma, yes.

11:13.472 --> 11:15.940
Look who's here to make you feel at home.

11:16.776 --> 11:19.802
- Are you here, too?
- Not yet, but it's all paid for.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.642
I'm gonna move in after my hip surgery.

11:21.714 --> 11:24.911
Minn comes twice a week for lunch,
in the meantime.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.815
She's one of the girls.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.114
Look how you've grown up, Paulie.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.247
I know. I don't understand.

11:31.457 --> 11:34.119
When I was a kid, you two were old ladies.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.889
Now I'm old, and you two are still old.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.291
So, how's Chucky doing, anyway?
Still teaching?

11:40.366 --> 11:43.893
He's been the high-school principal
for the last 10 years or so.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.129
Bergen North.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.401
- He must give you a lot of happiness.
- Except for that wife of his.

11:48.474 --> 11:52.171
- All you ever been was nice to her.
- I know that.

11:52.311 --> 11:56.213
- Come on, girls, I'll take you to lunch.
- I got to use the WC.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.676
She just went 10 minutes ago.

11:59.518 --> 12:02.146
I don't want to embarrass your mother
in the dining room.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.711
So make sure she knows...

12:03.789 --> 12:07.486
she can't sit with me and Minn,
and our other girls.

12:08.294 --> 12:10.785
- What are you talking about?
- We're a set group.

12:10.863 --> 12:13.730
We eat together,
we play Scrabble for money...

12:13.866 --> 12:16.562
and there's really no room at either table.

12:17.002 --> 12:18.629
Come on now, Cook.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.302
I know you girls can work it out.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.948
- Fucking amazing.
- This is how simple it is to change inputs.

12:34.053 --> 12:36.248
Listen to that imaging in stereo mode.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.790
It's like Clapton's sitting right there
at your house.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.636
Great, huh?

12:58.911 --> 13:02.642
We can all watch movies as a family now.
And listen to that.

13:03.649 --> 13:07.176
I think it's great. I'm going food shopping.

13:07.253 --> 13:09.346
<i>Maybe I'll get In the Bedroom.</i>

13:09.421 --> 13:12.413
- What time you want me to wake you up?
- The movie.

13:14.226 --> 13:16.660
Yeah. Good.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.088
Have fun.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.430
<i>- Helo?
- Mr. Wal, please.</i>

13:58.337 --> 14:01.465
<i>- Yeah, can you talk?
- Yeah, I'm on a hotel phone.</i>

14:01.640 --> 14:04.006
<i>So, how are you? What's going on?</i>

14:04.376 --> 14:07.743
<i>I found him, Chuck.
I found the man who kiled Helen.</i>

14:08.280 --> 14:11.113
<i>- What?
- It was me they were after.</i>

14:11.183 --> 14:12.650
<i>Who are they?</i>

14:13.986 --> 14:16.420
<i>Devlin MacGregor and Lentz.</i>

14:17.323 --> 14:20.315
<i>Lentz was supervising
the protocol for RDU-90.</i>

14:20.392 --> 14:24.226
<i>He knew I found out it was causing
liver damage. It was Lentz.</i>

14:26.799 --> 14:28.266
<i>Lentz is dead.</i>

14:28.968 --> 14:30.697
<i>What? How?</i>

14:31.136 --> 14:33.764
<i>He died in a car accident last summer.</i>

14:37.710 --> 14:40.144
<i>Can you prove this about the drug?</i>

14:40.412 --> 14:42.039
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

14:43.282 --> 14:45.079
<i>I need your help, Chuck.</i>

14:45.150 --> 14:48.642
<i>Cal Bones at the hospital.
Tel him to give me whatever help I need.</i>

14:48.721 --> 14:50.712
Beautiful looking animal.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.215
Great definition, carriage.

14:55.327 --> 14:58.490
- I'd love to paint her.
- Good.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.093
But what about this deadbeat?

15:02.534 --> 15:04.661
There's no problem cropping you both out.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.638
We could set her in front of the rail
at the track as she is.

15:07.706 --> 15:11.665
Or if you'd prefer something more pastoral,
we can place her in a meadow.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.544
I don't know about that, but can you
leave me in there and just crop him out?

15:15.614 --> 15:19.106
Easy. And frankly, it would be better,
composition-wise.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.220
Go for the pastoral, much more dignified.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.017
And it comes framed?

15:24.123 --> 15:27.615
Exactly as you see that one. $6,500.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.421
All right, you got a deal.

15:36.201 --> 15:38.192
- To Pie-O-Mine.
- My.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.332
- Your what?
- No, the name, it's Pie-O-My.

15:48.247 --> 15:50.681
I'll give you the whole thing now.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.111
There.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.782
I'd better get your receipt.
I'll just be a minute.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.525
<i>Let's not forget
to drink to the beautiful señorita...</i>

16:07.599 --> 16:09.863
whose idea this was in the first place.

16:09.935 --> 16:13.666
- I bet you say that to all the girls.
- There's not that many.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.902
And truthfully, the ones that there are,
they don't got many ideas.

16:18.077 --> 16:21.569
We should probably
start heading back soon.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.006
Yeah.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.318
If you want, on the way,
we can stop and eat something.

16:27.386 --> 16:29.013
Yeah, we could definitely stop.

16:34.293 --> 16:35.954
- Like that.
- So good.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.519
- Just like that.
- Yeah, that's so good.

17:05.424 --> 17:06.550
Let me up.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.054
You can see cows from in there.

17:40.125 --> 17:43.026
Sit down and eat before it gets any colder.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.505
- Looks good, doesn't it?
- Mine needed salt.

17:59.378 --> 18:03.041
Jesus fucking Christ,
these fucking hicks can't even get this right.

18:08.487 --> 18:09.886
You did this?

18:10.489 --> 18:12.184
That's very mature.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.317
It's not funny.

18:15.394 --> 18:17.658
I thought you had
an 8-year-old's sense of humor.

18:17.729 --> 18:19.924
Come here and give me a kiss.

18:21.200 --> 18:22.531
I'm eating.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.102
Not anymore, you're not.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.040
What if I promise to be good?

18:36.248 --> 18:37.476
How good?

18:39.451 --> 18:40.543
Good.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.365
Shit, I lost a nail.

19:00.172 --> 19:04.006
We will not be mentioning
anything about any of this to Ralph.

19:06.578 --> 19:09.809
I'll take it.
Can you send it to this person here?

19:10.215 --> 19:12.740
Sure. You want to include a card with this?

19:26.899 --> 19:28.628
Let me have another one.

19:37.943 --> 19:42.039
Round and round she goes,
where she stops, nobody knows.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.309
Place your bets, be a winner.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.515
- I'll take another card.
- Are you sure, dear?

19:54.193 --> 19:57.026
For the love of God, Nucci,
how could you hit on 18?

19:59.965 --> 20:01.728
Give me another one.

20:03.835 --> 20:05.894
That should've been my card!

20:06.505 --> 20:08.166
I could've had 21.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.631
I was hoping for a three.

20:11.543 --> 20:14.478
I'm not sure you understand the fine points.

20:15.080 --> 20:18.140
Maybe you ought to play roulette.
It's right over there.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.658
Round and round she goes,
where she stops, nobody knows.

21:03.528 --> 21:05.519
Goddamn it, Tony!

21:16.675 --> 21:19.200
You did that to me on our honeymoon.

21:19.311 --> 21:22.872
I didn't like it then, and I made you
promise me you'd never do it again.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.576
- It's just a little cold water.
- It's really unpleasant.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.141
Do you remember promising me?

21:27.219 --> 21:30.211
- You can do it back to me.
- I don't want to do it back to you.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.780
- Why not? It's fun.
- Do you remember promising me?

21:32.858 --> 21:34.883
- Yeah, so what?
- So...

21:35.127 --> 21:38.062
This is one promise
I would like you to keep.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.729
Whatever.

22:05.290 --> 22:06.985
This can't be Paulie.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.321
Chucky?

22:08.860 --> 22:11.920
Come here, you
pizza-face-son-of-a-son-of-a-gun you.

22:11.997 --> 22:15.797
Oh, God. Mr. Van Kowenberg,
what did we say about those shoes?

22:16.068 --> 22:19.196
The laces are in my locker,
I was gonna get them after study hall.

22:19.271 --> 22:20.568
Get them now.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.602
Come on, Paulie.

22:30.682 --> 22:33.116
Hard to believe it's been so long.

22:33.919 --> 22:35.511
This is for you.

22:37.622 --> 22:41.388
That's a nice gesture, Paul, but I really can't.

22:41.593 --> 22:44.619
Go on, I got lots of them.
You can't insult me.

22:49.668 --> 22:52.068
- No more glasses?
- I had the Lasik.

22:52.437 --> 22:55.895
- And your face cleared up pretty good, too?
- Cleared up in 10th grade.

22:55.974 --> 22:58.636
See, there you go. Ninth was my last.

23:06.184 --> 23:09.585
So, did your mom tell you
I saw her over at Green Grove?

23:09.654 --> 23:11.918
Apparently, she sees
quite a bit of your mother.

23:11.990 --> 23:15.016
That's just it, Chucky.
They're both residents.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.618
But there seems to be an exclusion.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.387
I don't blame your mother.

23:19.464 --> 23:22.592
I blame that Minn Matrone.
She's a malignant cunt.

23:24.936 --> 23:26.767
Excuse me for saying so.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.568
She eggs your mother on,
and she don't even live there.

23:29.641 --> 23:31.233
I'm not sure I understand.

23:31.309 --> 23:33.504
I'm just asking you to talk to your ma.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.638
See if she can include my ma more
with the group.

23:37.516 --> 23:39.381
It won't do much good.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.948
Now, you know how these old gals are.

23:42.020 --> 23:44.648
All I'm trying to do is pay my ma back...

23:44.723 --> 23:47.248
for when I was a kid
and got into so much trouble.

23:47.325 --> 23:50.317
She went to bat for me how many times?
With the nuns.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.057
With the store owners up and down
13th Street.

23:53.131 --> 23:56.032
And let's face it, Chucky, with the cops.

23:58.236 --> 24:00.101
For all the bad I did.

24:01.206 --> 24:03.674
I'm still capable if I don't watch myself.

24:03.742 --> 24:06.506
But with all of that, she always had my back.

24:09.881 --> 24:13.339
I'll talk to my ma, see what she says.
But like I said...

24:13.852 --> 24:17.549
- Whatever you can do.
- All right. Take care.

24:54.192 --> 24:57.252
Ale was always served in pints and quarts.

24:57.662 --> 25:01.723
So, "Mind your p's and q's,"
means "Watch your alcohol consumption. "

25:02.868 --> 25:04.563
I'll be right back.

25:04.703 --> 25:08.070
Holy cow.
So there's an origin for everything.

25:09.407 --> 25:11.534
- What's up?
- A little business.

25:12.878 --> 25:15.438
- Like what?
- Why? You want to hear this?

25:17.849 --> 25:22.252
We decided to give a bigger percentage
to the union guys than the customs guys.

25:22.487 --> 25:25.650
You're shitting me, right?
That's what you guys came up with?

25:25.724 --> 25:27.214
Everybody seemed pleased.

25:27.292 --> 25:29.192
Damn it, now I'll have to go down there...

25:29.261 --> 25:32.389
and do a go-see with everybody,
from the harbormaster on down...

25:32.464 --> 25:35.058
which is exactly what I was trying to avoid.

25:35.433 --> 25:37.799
You want it renegotiated,
that's what we'll do.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.803
Don't make me go down to Perth Amboy.

25:39.871 --> 25:43.602
I'm trying to free myself up
to do a little global thinking.

25:44.409 --> 25:45.569
Right.

25:55.387 --> 25:59.084
- So, girls, what's it gonna be?
- I'll have what I always have.

25:59.658 --> 26:02.957
Chicken Mario? 15 years of Chicken Mario.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.222
Can't you try the veal chop or something?

26:05.297 --> 26:07.788
Why are you giving me a hard time?
I like the chicken.

26:07.866 --> 26:10.562
- Hello, beautiful people.
- Look who it is.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.000
Hi, how are you?

26:12.304 --> 26:15.330
- Remember Valentina?
- Yeah, nice to see you again.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.567
Yeah, same here.

26:16.641 --> 26:19.166
You the one
who pulled that horseshit stunt?

26:21.646 --> 26:23.841
We're gonna have some steaks.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.914
- Maybe I'll have a steak.
- You don't need a steak.

26:26.985 --> 26:29.818
- I know I don't need a steak.
- Do me a favor.

26:30.121 --> 26:32.453
Don't fuck with the salt shaker.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.994
- You like the sole?
- The scampi for me.

26:40.332 --> 26:42.061
I don't know, give me...

26:42.200 --> 26:44.361
Come on, you're getting anorexic.

26:44.636 --> 26:47.696
I'm gonna make a call. Okay?

26:47.906 --> 26:51.171
You're wasting away.
Come on, what are you gonna do?

26:54.379 --> 26:55.471
Here.

26:57.515 --> 27:00.348
- No, you keep it.
- I don't want your consolation prize.

27:00.418 --> 27:03.012
I bet you have a standing order
at the jewelry store.

27:03.088 --> 27:06.421
- I gotta be getting back to my table.
- What, to the blonde out there?

27:06.491 --> 27:09.858
Does she fuck you better than me?
Suck your dick better than me?

27:17.636 --> 27:18.625
Come on.

27:25.877 --> 27:28.937
Really, Tony, just tell me.
How come I can't see you again?

27:29.014 --> 27:31.710
- Because you fuck Ralph.
- You got morals all of a sudden?

27:31.783 --> 27:33.808
I don't know about morals,
but I do got rules.

27:33.885 --> 27:37.116
Some dago macho bullshit about
"Don't fuck your friend's girlfriend"?

27:37.188 --> 27:38.553
Yeah, that.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.220
- But not just that.
- Then what?

27:46.398 --> 27:49.367
Look, that day in the countryside,
that was...

27:50.669 --> 27:53.729
- It was great.
- Did I do something wrong? I'll fix it.

27:53.805 --> 27:56.638
No, you can't fix the shit I'm talking about.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.542
I don't wanna be
where Ralph Cifaretto has been.

28:01.613 --> 28:02.602
You prick!

28:02.681 --> 28:06.117
A one-time thing is one thing,
but to get into a relationship...

28:07.118 --> 28:08.710
I gotta get back to my dinner.

28:09.387 --> 28:12.584
You don't know anything.
Let me tell you what's really going on.

28:12.724 --> 28:13.986
He doesn't fuck me.

28:14.059 --> 28:17.460
I swear to God,
he's some kind of freak or something.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.159
- You two don't have sex?
- No.

28:21.466 --> 28:24.731
- Sort of yeah, but not...
- All right, have a nice life.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.597
Go ahead.

28:26.805 --> 28:30.332
You go back first. I'll wait a minute.
We shouldn't go back together.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.348
- Everything come out all right?
- Yeah.

30:12.844 --> 30:15.938
- It's me, Valentina.
- You got no reason to be calling me.

30:16.181 --> 30:17.944
I have to tell you everything.

30:18.016 --> 30:22.180
I mean, I didn't want to tell you before,
because it's just so embarrassing.

30:22.253 --> 30:23.277
Where are you?

30:23.354 --> 30:25.379
<i>- I'm at Ralph's.
- Oh, Christ!</i>

30:25.456 --> 30:27.151
No, it's okay.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.482
He left.

30:31.095 --> 30:34.587
Ralph does not have sex like other people,
regular people.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.594
It's all some kind of kinky shit.
Believe me, I am not hung-up.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.230
I've done a lot. I've done girls...

30:41.306 --> 30:43.103
<i>I've done threesomes, and I've done...</i>

30:43.208 --> 30:45.699
<i>- With him?
- No, Tony, please, just listen.</i>

30:45.944 --> 30:48.242
Ralph is loco. For real, okay?

30:48.613 --> 30:51.241
<i>He just makes me do stuff,
not realy even sexual.</i>

30:51.583 --> 30:55.178
Like last night I just wanted him to fuck me,
just so I can get back at you.

30:55.253 --> 30:58.484
But all he wanted me to do
was drip candle wax on his balls...

30:58.556 --> 31:01.024
<i>then he went into the bathroom
and jerked himself off.</i>

31:01.092 --> 31:03.424
Now, I don't call that
having sex with someone.

31:03.494 --> 31:05.257
Oh, Jesus H. Christ.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.195
<i>Last week, I swear to God...</i>

31:07.265 --> 31:10.029
he told me to rub his dick raw
with a cheese grater.

31:10.101 --> 31:12.296
<i>- Get the fuck out of here.
- I wouldn't do it!</i>

31:12.370 --> 31:14.304
I told him to fuck off.

31:16.241 --> 31:17.572
<i>My accountant is here.</i>

31:18.142 --> 31:20.872
<i>- Wil you cal me?
- I gotta go.</i>

31:24.916 --> 31:26.281
Mozzarella?

31:29.220 --> 31:30.653
Let me ask you a question.

31:30.722 --> 31:34.385
You think Ralph's
a little weird about women?

31:34.659 --> 31:36.388
I don't know, Ton'.

31:37.095 --> 31:40.531
I mean, he beat one to death just for...

31:43.067 --> 31:44.694
I forget. What was it again?

31:45.203 --> 31:48.138
- Maybe you're feeling guilty.
- I don't see that.

31:50.808 --> 31:51.797
Why would I?

31:52.443 --> 31:55.276
Because he's a friend of yours,
and you're cuckolding him.

31:56.681 --> 31:59.809
Cuckolding is when a man has an affair
with another's wife.

31:59.884 --> 32:02.011
<i>She's not his wife anyway.
She's his cumare.</i>

32:02.086 --> 32:05.715
<i>- And therefore has no status whatever.
- Cumares have status.</i>

32:06.357 --> 32:09.849
I mean, it's not like in the old days,
when a man had a wife...

32:09.961 --> 32:12.020
and then sort of a second wife.

32:12.096 --> 32:15.031
Used to be the men would take out
their wives on Fridays...

32:15.099 --> 32:17.124
<i>and their cumares on Saturdays.</i>

32:17.201 --> 32:19.169
Or maybe it's the other way around.

32:19.971 --> 32:22.735
Anyway, when I came up,
it wasn't so formal.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.903
Business associate of mine's
got two full families.

32:27.145 --> 32:29.579
One up here, one down in Sea Girt.

32:30.281 --> 32:33.216
And his second wife busts his balls
identical to the first.

32:33.284 --> 32:35.718
Sounds like a complicated arrangement.

32:37.322 --> 32:40.223
- I'm afraid our time is up.
- Just give me another minute.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.759
- I have a patient waiting.
- Well, let him wait.

32:42.827 --> 32:44.920
You make me wait out there all the time.

32:46.130 --> 32:49.964
I just wanna ask you if it's possible
for a man to go out with a woman...

32:50.401 --> 32:52.665
without really doing anything with them.

32:52.737 --> 32:55.763
- You'll have to be more specific.
- He likes them to hurt him.

32:56.641 --> 32:57.835
And that's it.

32:59.344 --> 33:01.175
And then he goes and he...

33:02.246 --> 33:05.044
takes care of himself, his own needs.

33:06.017 --> 33:08.383
He sounds like a textbook masochist.

33:08.586 --> 33:10.918
- Like S & M?
- The "M" part, yes.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.626
I thought all that stuff
was just like a run-up to the act.

33:15.927 --> 33:17.792
That's the case for many people.

33:17.895 --> 33:20.420
But not for people with paraphilias.

33:21.232 --> 33:24.201
For them, receiving pain, being humiliated...

33:24.268 --> 33:28.204
becomes, in and of itself, the sexual release.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.800
Like many other things,
we believe it's rooted in childhood.

33:33.444 --> 33:36.470
- We can continue this next week.
- Just one more second.

33:36.781 --> 33:39.375
I received regular beatings
when I was a kid...

33:39.550 --> 33:41.814
but I'm not going around
looking for some woman...

33:41.886 --> 33:44.377
to hook up jumper cables
to my private parts.

33:44.455 --> 33:46.480
It's not a simple one-to-one.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.555
More than likely,
he had a controlling and punishing mother.

33:50.795 --> 33:53.821
She loved him,
but showed it only in connection...

33:53.898 --> 33:57.857
with some sort of violent or abusive act.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.369
Is everything about everybody
really about their mothers?

34:05.576 --> 34:07.544
All right, back to the other thing.

34:08.112 --> 34:10.978
For a guy like that,
he's going out with a woman...

34:11.815 --> 34:15.308
he could technically not have
penisary contact with her vulva.

34:15.652 --> 34:18.985
It sounds like you're asking me
for personal information...

34:19.056 --> 34:20.489
I really can't give you.

34:36.841 --> 34:38.536
Good morning, Pickwick Framing.

34:41.545 --> 34:42.603
Hello?

34:52.889 --> 34:56.882
<i>It's so heartbreaking to hear those women
talk about what they were going through...</i>

34:56.960 --> 34:58.394
<i>and what they are going through.</i>

34:58.463 --> 35:02.194
<i>The second woman, Joan,
her case is realy not very unusual.</i>

35:03.301 --> 35:06.464
<i>Her husband was the financial planner.
She realy did not have...</i>

35:06.537 --> 35:09.199
<i>much involvement
in the finances at the home.</i>

35:09.574 --> 35:11.337
<i>What are your thoughts on that?</i>

35:11.409 --> 35:14.344
<i>Women tend to have the feeling
that they're not confident.</i>

35:14.412 --> 35:17.677
<i>Men tend to be overconfident,
actualy, in the financial area.</i>

35:17.748 --> 35:21.741
<i>And women have to take responsibility,
and have to accept the fact...</i>

35:21.819 --> 35:23.013
<i>that something like this...</i>

35:23.087 --> 35:24.918
<i>We don't need no</i>

35:26.757 --> 35:29.555
<i>We don't need no thought control</i>

35:30.628 --> 35:34.064
<i>You have to have a contingency plan
if your husband doesn't come home...</i>

35:34.132 --> 35:35.656
<i>to take care of the finances.</i>

36:14.338 --> 36:17.205
You gotta get up, Ma.
You can't lie there day and night.

36:18.576 --> 36:19.804
I wanna go home.

36:21.979 --> 36:25.346
There is no more home, Ma. We sold it.
You know that.

36:25.983 --> 36:28.042
They keep making me eat all alone.

36:28.553 --> 36:32.182
That's that Cookie and Minn.
I tried to be so nice.

36:32.890 --> 36:36.348
I bought Cookie a card
from the gift shop downstairs.

36:36.594 --> 36:40.394
I cared enough, and I sent the very best.

36:40.765 --> 36:42.062
Don't you worry, Ma.

36:42.366 --> 36:46.268
I'm gonna talk to this social director.
She's the one to straighten this all out.

36:46.904 --> 36:49.634
But in the meantime,
maybe you can make new friends.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.608
But you gotta get up out of bed.
At least sit up.

38:17.728 --> 38:18.353
No.

39:21.325 --> 39:23.316
<i>Friggitoria Fiorenzano...</i>

39:24.462 --> 39:28.330
<i>in my opinion, this is probably one of
the closest things we'I find in Naples...</i>

39:28.399 --> 39:32.699
<i>to what you realy should open.
It's an al- day snack shop, pizzeria...</i>

39:32.937 --> 39:35.030
<i>friggitoria and rosticceria.</i>

39:35.306 --> 39:37.638
<i>Roast shop, fry shop, pizza shop.</i>

39:37.708 --> 39:40.040
<i>Here are four examples...</i>

39:40.478 --> 39:43.811
<i>of the classic Neapolitan pride.</i>

39:55.993 --> 39:58.826
<i>It's in a light batter, fried til very crisp.</i>

39:59.029 --> 40:01.554
<i>We've got those zucchini flowers,
you recognize those?</i>

40:02.032 --> 40:04.592
We're bringing her back
to the track in two weeks.

40:04.902 --> 40:07.132
Lois says she's ready to race.

40:07.972 --> 40:09.837
- Thanks.
- Thanks, hon.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.434
I like my drink with extra olives.

40:13.844 --> 40:16.870
You should know how
your regular customers like their drinks.

40:17.381 --> 40:19.713
My regular customers are the ones who pay.

40:20.618 --> 40:22.415
I'll get you your olives.

40:26.123 --> 40:28.057
What do you have to give her shit for?

40:28.125 --> 40:29.854
She likes it, it's banter.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.020
I don't think she likes it, or you.

40:32.229 --> 40:36.427
I don't give a flying fuck, my brother,
what any little slit thinks of me.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.873
Does that include... What's her name?

40:43.140 --> 40:45.472
- Who?
- You brought her to the stables.

40:46.911 --> 40:49.505
Valentina. Her especially.

40:49.814 --> 40:51.406
And her, I'm crazy about.

40:51.649 --> 40:53.810
I'm telling you, this broad knows things.

40:53.884 --> 40:57.251
I've never been fucked so long or so good.

40:58.823 --> 41:00.347
I may have to marry her.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.763
These enough?

41:06.931 --> 41:09.126
You know, no reason to be snotty.

41:09.867 --> 41:12.233
My dear departed mother used to say:

41:12.803 --> 41:14.896
"You catch more flies with honey...

41:15.172 --> 41:17.367
"than you can with vinegar. "

41:20.344 --> 41:24.280
Well, mine always told me not to let myself
be talked down to by losers.

41:24.615 --> 41:28.073
She said you can tell everything
about a man by the way he treats women.

41:37.061 --> 41:39.552
- You ever think about your mother?
- She's dead.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.631
You two didn't get along very well, right?

41:42.700 --> 41:44.224
She had her demanding ways.

41:46.403 --> 41:49.338
- When you were a kid, did she ever...
- No, I gotta go.

41:50.541 --> 41:52.441
The Mambo Queen awaits.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.945
I'm sorry your mom's having
a difficult adjustment period.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.507
- Sit.
- It's not her.

42:01.719 --> 42:03.983
It's the rest of them. They single her out.

42:04.722 --> 42:08.123
Sometimes I think this place
is like high school with wheelchairs.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.329
Tell your mother to be patient.
Things will settle down.

42:12.963 --> 42:15.227
All right, I'll talk to her again.

42:15.599 --> 42:17.692
But what the hell are you gonna do for us?

42:17.768 --> 42:21.169
- What we pay here.
- I'm speaking from years of experience.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.131
Your mom's going to have to learn...

42:23.207 --> 42:25.539
to accept responsibility
for her own behavior.

42:25.609 --> 42:26.769
Like what?

42:27.745 --> 42:28.734
Go ahead.

42:30.114 --> 42:32.139
For one thing, she cries a lot.

42:33.684 --> 42:35.015
She's always in tears.

42:35.586 --> 42:39.784
At Mass, in the exercise room,
at music appreciation.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.085
- She's got a big heart.
- Let me finish.

42:43.694 --> 42:45.662
She doesn't always put her teeth in.

42:46.630 --> 42:48.154
The girls don't like that.

42:49.099 --> 42:51.226
- This is not good.
- Right.

42:51.769 --> 42:53.361
Also, she's a tattletale.

42:53.437 --> 42:56.235
She tells on the other girls
for the slightest infraction.

42:56.307 --> 42:59.208
She's just not very adept at making friends.

42:59.977 --> 43:02.172
She's gonna have to make more of an effort.

43:02.313 --> 43:04.474
You might want to talk to her about this.

43:27.571 --> 43:30.301
Hey, Conny Contino ever get
those washing machines?

43:30.374 --> 43:32.467
I don't understand.
You want to know this shit?

43:32.543 --> 43:35.103
'Cause you go back on everything
Sil and me get settled.

43:35.179 --> 43:37.044
I don't got a right to be concerned?

43:37.114 --> 43:38.206
<i>Hold on.</i>

43:43.087 --> 43:44.850
- Go.
- Long time no see.

43:47.024 --> 43:48.753
- Is this you?
- I am me.

43:48.826 --> 43:51.351
<i>- I've been busy, you know.
- Then I forgive you.</i>

43:51.428 --> 43:53.760
When can I see you?
I've got something to tell you.

43:53.831 --> 43:56.231
Look, I told you the situation.

43:56.433 --> 43:59.630
Come on, Tony.
Just for a coffee or a drink or something.

44:02.206 --> 44:05.903
All right, you know the Coach House
on Route 21 in Passaic?

44:06.110 --> 44:07.600
No, but I can find it.

44:07.811 --> 44:10.644
- Can you be there by noon?
- Nothing could keep me away.

44:11.281 --> 44:13.010
All right, I'll see you there.

44:18.288 --> 44:20.779
All right, I want to see
you and Sil this afternoon.

44:21.392 --> 44:23.690
2:00 at the other place.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.326
Fuck.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.788
So sorry I'm late.
I had to make up this whole thing at work.

44:55.859 --> 44:57.622
- It's all right.
- What can I get for you?

44:57.695 --> 44:59.287
Evian, whatever.

45:01.532 --> 45:05.525
So, I'm here.
What's this big thing you have to tell me?

45:07.938 --> 45:09.462
I broke up with Ralph.

45:11.108 --> 45:12.405
- When?
- Last night.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.434
I just couldn't take it.

45:14.511 --> 45:17.446
- He brought out this leather mask with this...
- All right.

45:22.352 --> 45:24.582
This means we can be together.

45:28.525 --> 45:30.516
Look, Valentina, I'm...

45:31.361 --> 45:34.296
I'm a married man.
I'm a happily married man with two kids.

45:34.364 --> 45:36.298
I just wanna see you sometimes.

45:36.366 --> 45:38.994
A couple nights a week.
I'm not gonna say I love you.

45:39.069 --> 45:42.732
I always say that too soon to guys,
and I'm trying to work on that, but...

45:43.907 --> 45:45.238
I really like you.

45:45.309 --> 45:48.039
I like you, too, honey,
but it's not gonna happen.

45:48.812 --> 45:50.336
Why? Why not?

45:51.448 --> 45:53.939
For one thing, I already took his horse.

46:12.770 --> 46:13.964
$9,900.

46:14.438 --> 46:16.872
Interestingly, at $10,000...

46:16.940 --> 46:20.068
we're required by law
to notify the IRS of the transaction.

46:20.144 --> 46:22.977
Really? I want it in something safe.

46:23.347 --> 46:25.713
Something old economy, maybe treasuries.

47:14.231 --> 47:15.562
Don't you knock?

47:18.268 --> 47:21.931
Listen, Jan, can we shut this off a minute?
I got something I gotta ask you.

47:22.239 --> 47:23.297
Sure.

47:30.047 --> 47:31.514
It's a little awkward.

47:33.617 --> 47:34.709
It's about Ralph.

47:35.619 --> 47:37.610
- That scumbag?
- Yeah, well...

47:38.555 --> 47:40.887
I'm trying to find out about his sex life.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.192
- And who would know better?
- He would.

47:45.696 --> 47:47.493
- Ask him.
- I can't.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.193
I can only ask you.

47:52.002 --> 47:53.902
I mean, is he weird about sex?

47:55.539 --> 47:59.305
- Why you interested in this?
- I got my reasons. Managerial.

48:00.244 --> 48:04.112
You know, like the army, it's got policies
about this shit, on account of combat.

48:04.181 --> 48:07.548
I have to tell you, I'm finding
this entire conversation insulting.

48:08.385 --> 48:09.579
Here we go.

48:10.220 --> 48:12.950
You're asking me to betray confidences.

48:15.826 --> 48:19.455
I mean, no matter what
either one of us think of the guy...

48:31.275 --> 48:32.640
$3,000.

48:34.511 --> 48:36.035
How'd you come up with that figure?

48:36.113 --> 48:39.105
It's a number
that I thought you'd say yes to.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.845
You thought right.

48:41.652 --> 48:43.210
So, what have you heard?

48:43.754 --> 48:46.348
You pay me $3,000,
I'll answer your questions.

48:46.423 --> 48:48.118
He bottoms from the top.

48:49.393 --> 48:51.156
I don't even know what that means.

48:51.228 --> 48:55.062
It means he has to control things,
but he pretends he doesn't.

48:55.499 --> 48:58.229
Like, he'd make me fuck him
with a strap-on...

48:58.368 --> 49:00.563
and call him my bitch, shit like that.

49:00.637 --> 49:04.266
- What about plain old fucking?
- I'm telling you. He can't get hard that way.

49:04.374 --> 49:07.241
And if he could,
I don't think that he'd want to.

49:21.191 --> 49:23.751
I couldn't believe it when you called.

49:24.461 --> 49:26.554
I was so happy.

49:28.732 --> 49:30.666
I'm feeling pretty happy myself.

49:33.103 --> 49:35.298
Why the big change of heart?

49:38.742 --> 49:41.540
Well, I was never hesitating 'cause of you.

49:42.245 --> 49:44.770
I just had to get my head into a place...

49:45.282 --> 49:48.877
where I felt
that I could really commit, you know.

49:50.354 --> 49:52.982
To lavish all the care on you
that you should have.

50:27.924 --> 50:31.360
I don't see why
I have to do anything I don't want to.

50:32.129 --> 50:34.097
This is Green Grove.

50:34.464 --> 50:37.262
Here the senior citizen is king and queen.

50:37.801 --> 50:41.328
I know, but they told Charles
that this was just a warning.

50:41.405 --> 50:43.339
These people don't fool around.

50:44.374 --> 50:45.807
You're afraid of them.

50:45.942 --> 50:48.342
Of course he is, and so am I.

50:48.612 --> 50:51.479
This is a stupid thing
for your son to get hurt over.

50:51.548 --> 50:55.882
I didn't live for 84 years
to have to be nice to somebody I don't like!

50:57.387 --> 50:59.514
Haven't I earned that right?

51:00.624 --> 51:04.685
Ma, I'm gonna have to say this.
If you can't get into the spirit of this thing...

51:04.895 --> 51:08.023
then we'll have
to let you live in a different home.

51:09.800 --> 51:13.827
The Salvation Army has one in Irvington
that's supposed to be perfectly fine.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.150
Coffee, Ton'?

52:05.655 --> 52:07.384
Got any decaf?

52:09.960 --> 52:13.418
- No, forget it, regular's fine.
- Well, I can make decaf.

52:14.631 --> 52:16.258
Yeah, that'd be great, thanks.

52:36.486 --> 52:38.113
Something wrong, Tony?

52:41.491 --> 52:42.480
No.

52:43.760 --> 52:44.749
Why?

52:51.334 --> 52:54.326
You out in the backyard
the last couple a days?

52:54.404 --> 52:56.838
Me? It's freezing out there.

52:58.942 --> 53:00.375
You sure?

53:00.810 --> 53:02.334
The pool guy come around?

53:02.412 --> 53:05.176
- Why would he?
- Check up on stuff? Something?

53:06.850 --> 53:08.545
All right, I'm going upstairs.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.853
It'll only take a minute.

53:28.638 --> 53:32.005
You sure, Tony, there's not something
you wanna talk about?

53:34.177 --> 53:35.337
No.

53:36.846 --> 53:37.904
Like what?
