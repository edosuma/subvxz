00:08.890 --> 00:13.110
Oh, I love Christmas.
Cutting down the tree,

00:13.200 --> 00:15.570
taking Dad to the emergency room,

00:15.650 --> 00:17.570
hanging up the lights,

00:17.600 --> 00:19.670
taking Dad to the emergency room.

00:19.710 --> 00:20.870
Singing Christmas carols.

00:20.910 --> 00:23.770
Taking Dad to the emergency room.

00:23.810 --> 00:26.710
It's amazing how much his "fa la la la la"

00:26.740 --> 00:28.780
sounds like the mating call of a raccoon.

00:29.810 --> 00:32.850
Hey, rabies is no laughing matter.

00:34.790 --> 00:37.820
We're gonna mail these Christmas
cards to your nurses and doctors.

00:37.860 --> 00:40.720
Try not to get hurt
while we're away, honey.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.690
Don't worry. I'm just going
to hang these stockings.

00:43.730 --> 00:45.730
With this nail gun!

00:47.840 --> 00:50.670
Chyna, don't let your
father play with this.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.870
Okay.

00:53.910 --> 00:57.750
Hey, wait! You're standing under
the mistletoe. Give me a kiss.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.880
Darryl...

01:00.920 --> 01:04.019
Come on, I dislocated
my shoulder putting that up.

01:07.890 --> 01:09.660
Good day.

01:09.690 --> 01:10.860
All right.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.830
Get out!

01:23.710 --> 01:27.680
If you're looking for the tip of'rour
thumb, Mom put it in the freezer.

01:27.710 --> 01:28.610
Actually, I'm looking for
the present your mom got me

01:28.650 --> 01:30.810
so I know what to get her.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.880
If I spend less than her, I look cheap.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.850
If I spend more than her,
I make her look bad.

01:35.880 --> 01:39.850
To be fair, that rhinestone
pantsuit you bought her last year

01:39.890 --> 01:42.790
really did make her look bad.

01:42.820 --> 01:44.960
The point is, if I knew what she got me,

01:44.990 --> 01:47.690
I could get her something
that costs exactly the same.

01:48.860 --> 01:49.960
What did she buy me?

01:50.000 --> 01:51.730
Nothing.
Perfect.

01:51.760 --> 01:52.660
I'm done shopping.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.830
I meant nothing yet.

01:55.870 --> 01:57.740
She's doing her shopping over the weekend.

01:57.770 --> 02:00.640
That's it. I'll secretly
spy on her at the mall

02:00.670 --> 02:02.670
to see what she gets me.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.650
But now it's time to hang this wreath.

02:12.750 --> 02:17.720
Hey, Rose.
Yeah, it's me again.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.690
In about five minutes, we're
gonna need an ambulance.

03:15.910 --> 03:19.070
Oh, I love the holiday season.

03:19.160 --> 03:24.100
I don't know. To me, Christmas
has become so un-commercialized.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.860
No one focuses on what
this season is truly about.

03:28.510 --> 03:29.420
Economics.

03:30.660 --> 03:31.930
What?

03:31.960 --> 03:34.960
Seventy-eight percent
earned during the Christmas,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.870
and to a lesser degree, Chanukah season.

03:37.900 --> 03:41.600
Joy and good cheer won't put us on
the road to financial recovery.

03:44.710 --> 03:47.980
Attention minions!
Your natural talents

03:48.010 --> 03:49.810
to make toys for me.

03:49.850 --> 03:50.910
Aren't you a little old for toys?

03:52.680 --> 03:56.880
Or, really, anything and orthopedic shoes?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.750
I may be old but I'm going to outlive you!

04:01.020 --> 04:03.660
And the toys are not for me.

04:03.690 --> 04:06.690
They're for a group the local orphanage.

04:06.730 --> 04:10.630
Aw, that's a great idea,
Principal Skidmore.

04:10.670 --> 04:12.730
It will really make
their Christmas special.

04:12.770 --> 04:14.940
Yeah. Who wants
store-bought toy made,

04:14.970 --> 04:17.740
when you can get
by an 11-year-old

04:17.769 --> 04:18.970
with Popsicle sticks and glue?

04:21.980 --> 04:23.640
Merry Christmas!

04:29.950 --> 04:33.790
Okay, we need to come up
with a toy to make.

04:33.820 --> 04:35.820
What do little kids like to play with?

04:36.790 --> 04:39.760
Fire. Sharp objects.

04:39.990 --> 04:42.630
Abandoned wells.

04:43.830 --> 04:44.860
How about yo-yos?

04:44.900 --> 04:48.670
Yo-yos?
They're incredibly dangerous!

04:49.800 --> 04:51.640
I made the perfect thing.

04:53.740 --> 04:56.670
It looks like a high school textbook,

04:56.710 --> 04:58.840
but it's hollowed out
so the teacher can't tell

04:58.880 --> 05:01.650
that inside you're concealing

05:01.680 --> 05:02.880
a college textbook.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.920
Toys are supposed to be fun.

05:06.950 --> 05:08.720
Like these action figures of dead artists.

05:10.590 --> 05:12.690
Look! Here's
a Salvador Dali dolly.

05:18.630 --> 05:20.560
Ew! Why is it wet?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.800
I don't know.

05:22.830 --> 05:25.600
It's not like I just slapped a
mustache on a Tinkle Time Tina doll.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.870
True, children love dead artists and pee,

05:30.910 --> 05:33.880
but maybe we can come up
with a few other ideas.

05:33.910 --> 05:35.850
Okay, let's think outside the box.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.810
No, that's what we've been doing.

05:37.850 --> 05:39.820
Maybe we should think inside the box.

05:44.890 --> 05:47.720
Hey! It worked!

05:47.760 --> 05:49.690
I've got the perfect idea!
Check this out.

06:03.910 --> 06:05.910
Nice!

06:07.580 --> 06:11.680
That was my idea.
I was just demonstrating it.

06:11.710 --> 06:13.820
Come on, Chyna, it's not
about taking credit.

06:13.850 --> 06:14.950
It's about helping the orphans...

06:16.750 --> 06:17.790
...with my really
good idea.

06:22.660 --> 06:24.730
Hi, Lexi. You got
a Christmas job?

06:24.760 --> 06:28.560
I'm so impressed with your work ethic.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.660
Thanks! I'm saving up
to get my own butler.

06:32.630 --> 06:36.770
Anyway, I want you to wrap
this special gift I bought.

06:39.670 --> 06:40.840
It's a sweater for my sister.

06:43.980 --> 06:44.980
Do you hate your sister?

06:45.910 --> 06:49.580
Yes!

06:49.620 --> 06:51.890
She thinks she's so pretty.

06:51.920 --> 06:53.750
We'll see how pretty
she looks in this sweater.

06:58.660 --> 07:01.600
Darryl, what are you doing?

07:01.630 --> 07:04.570
I'm not Darryl, I'm a snowman!

07:11.770 --> 07:12.870
Sorry I'm late.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.910
What are you wearing?

07:14.940 --> 07:17.850
You said we were hired to be
rappers, so I came dressed as one.

07:19.780 --> 07:20.680
Yo, can I get a beat?

07:23.620 --> 07:25.650
Just kidding, I brought my own!

07:36.830 --> 07:40.670
Congratulations!
We have made 100 jack-in-the-boxes!

07:48.680 --> 07:52.650
Congratulations!
We have made 99 jack-in-the-boxes!

07:54.920 --> 07:56.920
Who's in charge of quality control?

07:56.950 --> 07:58.690
He is.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.590
Hey, guys, check out this early
Christmas gift I got from my aunt.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.700
It's a jack-in-the-box!

08:10.600 --> 08:13.630
Whoa!

08:13.670 --> 08:17.540
It's our jack-in-the-box.
Where did your aunt get this?

08:17.570 --> 08:21.780
A website. "Skidmore's
Hand-Crafted Toys."

08:25.750 --> 08:26.850
Hey, that's our principal's name!

08:29.850 --> 08:32.750
Skidmore's selling the
boxes we made for profit,

08:32.789 --> 08:35.559
and the orphans get nothing!

08:35.590 --> 08:37.659
Wow, I resent being forced to work

08:37.690 --> 08:40.730
in sweatshop-like conditions
under false pretenses!

08:43.630 --> 08:47.630
But I must say, I do admire
her entrepreneurial spirit.

08:47.670 --> 08:48.840
Very Christmas-y.

08:58.700 --> 09:01.670
Principal Skidmore, we know
what you've been up to.

09:01.710 --> 09:04.580
You know we've been serving
porcupine milk at the cafeteria?

09:06.810 --> 09:08.780
Uh, not that.

09:08.810 --> 09:10.610
You know we've been serving
porcupine meat in the cafeteria?

09:11.750 --> 09:12.820
No!

09:12.850 --> 09:13.750
You know that we've been...

09:15.650 --> 09:17.750
Why don't you just tell me what you know.

09:17.790 --> 09:21.690
We know that you've been selling
our jack-in-the-boxes for profit.

09:21.730 --> 09:22.560
You said you were helping the needy.

09:22.590 --> 09:24.690
I am. I'm needy.

09:26.830 --> 09:29.700
I need money!

09:29.730 --> 09:31.700
I can't believe you'd do
something like this.

09:31.740 --> 09:33.670
Especially at Christmas.

09:33.710 --> 09:36.770
I am disgusted.
How do you sleep at night?

09:36.810 --> 09:39.780
I don't. I sleep
during the day.

09:39.810 --> 09:42.710
At night, I go prowling for
silver foxes at the discotheques.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.680
I'm now more disgusted.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.930
Uh, excuse me, I'm here
about the Santa Claus job.

09:54.960 --> 09:55.930
I'm looking for the mall manager.

09:58.830 --> 10:02.800
Ho, ho, ho! That would be me.
The name's Nick.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.900
Uh, Darryl Parks.

10:04.940 --> 10:06.910
Darryl, good to meet you.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.770
I've been looking high and low

10:08.810 --> 10:10.710
for someone who could pass as Santa.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.850
I think you might fit the bill.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.720
Okay. So, I would get to sit up on
that chair and spy on everybody?

10:19.990 --> 10:21.790
I mean, to see who's naughty or nice.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.790
I'd like to hire you, but you
have to provide your own elf.

10:26.830 --> 10:29.760
My own elf?
Yes, and good luck.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.930
I've been trying to find one for months.

10:31.970 --> 10:36.970
Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a
meeting with my assistant manager.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.710
Don't worry.
I know where to find an elf.

10:45.780 --> 10:48.950
Dad, you promised I'd never
have to dress like an elf again

10:48.980 --> 10:50.810
after that time you made
me live in the tree house

10:50.850 --> 10:53.020
and bake cookies.

10:53.050 --> 10:57.820
I know, but I need your help for a
top secret police investigation.

10:57.860 --> 11:00.030
So secret, you can't tell anyone.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.930
Not even Mom?

11:01.960 --> 11:03.930
Especially not Mom.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.630
Last time I told her a secret,

11:05.670 --> 11:07.630
she blabbed it to everyone.

11:07.670 --> 11:08.670
You wear pink underpants.

11:14.010 --> 11:16.670
I can't believe Skidmore.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.940
Christmas is supposed to
be about love, and joy,

11:19.980 --> 11:22.780
and kindness to your fellow man.

11:22.810 --> 11:24.810
Let's pound her into a fine, powdery paste!

11:26.750 --> 11:28.920
We need to teach Skidmore a lesson!

11:28.950 --> 11:31.690
And not something she'd
enjoy, like trigonometry!

11:34.690 --> 11:35.890
We should teach her a lesson.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.930
And I think I know just how to do it.

with booby traps to go
off in Skidmore's face.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.760
Fletcher, you are on fire!

12:11.860 --> 12:13.760

Merry Christmas.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.730
"Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas."

12:17.670 --> 12:18.940
This story's a little repetitive.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.710
"Printed in the Philippines."

12:26.650 --> 12:28.680
Wow, what a twist ending.

12:31.680 --> 12:34.650
Excuse me, ladies? Have either of you
seen anything out of the ordinary?

12:34.690 --> 12:36.920
Besides you in tights?

12:40.890 --> 12:43.690
Hi, Mrs. Parks.
I wrapped that ugly sweater for you.

12:43.730 --> 12:47.000
Your sister will be so surprised.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.740
Cameron?
What are you doing?

13:03.880 --> 13:05.820
I'm not Cameron, I'm an elf!

13:11.890 --> 13:13.960
So, in exactly two hours,

13:13.990 --> 13:18.630
our jack-in-the-boxes are set
to go off in Skidmore's face!

13:18.660 --> 13:19.870
Fletcher, I'm still in awe of your genius.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.800
What?

13:23.770 --> 13:27.740
Kids, I thought about what you said to me,

13:27.770 --> 13:30.780
and last night I had an awful dream

13:30.810 --> 13:32.910
where I was visited by the
ghost of my Christmases

13:32.940 --> 13:34.810
past, present, and future.

13:35.780 --> 13:36.710
In one night?

13:38.880 --> 13:41.020
I would think your past alone
would take a good month.

13:43.650 --> 13:45.720
And given your age, I'm surprised
you even had a future.

13:47.820 --> 13:48.960
Shut it!

13:48.990 --> 13:51.690
The point is I've decided to be nice!

13:53.830 --> 13:54.960
To make amends, I have donated

13:55.000 --> 13:58.730
the entire last batch of toys
to the orphanage.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.770
What?

14:01.810 --> 14:04.640
I just dropped them off.
And I've got to say, it felt good.

14:08.750 --> 14:09.910
This is terrible.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.710
We've got to find a way to sneak in

14:11.750 --> 14:13.620
and get those
jack-in-the-boxes back

14:13.650 --> 14:15.820
before they go off in the orphanage!

14:15.850 --> 14:18.950
I've got it!
You can get on my shoulders,

14:18.990 --> 14:20.790
and Chyna can get on your shoulders,

14:20.820 --> 14:22.620
and we can put on a trench coat,

14:22.660 --> 14:24.730
and pretend to be the orphanage inspector.

14:27.730 --> 14:30.830
That's ridiculous.
We'll never find a trench coat that long.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.770
But there might be another
way for us to sneak in.

14:50.820 --> 14:53.620
You know the front door
was unlocked, right?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.730
Yeah, we know.
What's fun about a door?

14:57.660 --> 14:59.700
Let's go get
those jack-in-the-boxes.

15:02.030 --> 15:05.840
Which ones are they?
All these boxes are the same size.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.640
Maybe we could tell by shaking them.

15:14.840 --> 15:16.260
Okay, that's not one of them.

15:22.860 --> 15:24.730
Yeah, yeah, I heard you, man.

15:24.770 --> 15:27.000
Video games, a new bike,
world peace, blah blah blah.

15:28.900 --> 15:31.600
Where do you think you're going?

15:31.640 --> 15:34.710
Santa's just going to the bathroom
to deliver a lump of coal.

15:34.740 --> 15:36.880
Well, ho-ho-hold it in!

15:40.780 --> 15:41.850
Cameron! Psst!

15:43.020 --> 15:46.650
I have reason to believe your mother may be

15:46.690 --> 15:49.660
the mastermind behind
this whole crime spree.

15:49.690 --> 15:53.630
I knew it! She's been acting
very suspicious lately.

15:53.660 --> 15:56.700
The other day I saw her
wiping the refrigerator door.

15:56.730 --> 16:00.000
I asked what she was doing, and she said,

16:00.040 --> 16:02.670
"Getting rid of
these fingerprints."

16:04.670 --> 16:06.670
Exactly!
She's over there.

16:06.710 --> 16:09.710
Now, follow her, see what's in
her bag, and report back to me.

16:09.740 --> 16:15.950
I'm on it.

16:24.990 --> 16:27.760
Pink underpants?
Dad will love these!

16:30.930 --> 16:33.770
And I'm sure they'll
look good on you too...

16:33.800 --> 16:34.700
...sir.

16:43.850 --> 16:46.950
Ugh! No jack-in-the-box
in this one, either.

16:46.980 --> 16:48.850
I can't believe how many
presents there are.

16:48.890 --> 16:51.690
Yee-haw!

16:51.720 --> 16:54.790
Oh, come on!
Can you guys please help me?

16:54.830 --> 16:55.930
These jack-in-the-boxes are
going to go off any minute!

16:55.960 --> 16:58.830
Hey, careful!

16:58.860 --> 17:00.960
Can't you see we're in the middle
of a congressional hearing?

17:03.770 --> 17:04.800
Yee-haw!

17:06.599 --> 17:09.940
Okay, here's that wrapping
paper you wanted wrapped.

17:10.670 --> 17:12.940
Great gift, by the way.

17:15.650 --> 17:17.750
I need a little help here.

17:18.650 --> 17:18.710
Paisley?

17:22.619 --> 17:25.849
I couldn't wrap this rocking
chair, so I went with Plan B.

17:25.890 --> 17:29.920
You wrapped yourself?
How is that Plan B?

17:29.960 --> 17:32.960
Well, when the family opens
me on Christmas morning,

17:32.990 --> 17:36.830
I'll say, "Hey, you got a really cool
rocking chair, but I couldn't wrap it.

17:37.900 --> 17:38.900
"And can I use your bathroom?

17:38.930 --> 17:41.870
"Because I've been
under your tree all night."

17:54.920 --> 17:58.820
Ho, ho, ho.
What would you like for Christmas?

17:58.850 --> 18:04.790
Well, let's see.
I want a dolly, and I want a tea set,

18:04.830 --> 18:06.860
and I want to know what the
heck you're up to, Darryl!

18:08.830 --> 18:11.830
Dad, don't let that dude with
the beard sit in your lap.

18:15.670 --> 18:17.670
Wow, the likeness is uncanny.

18:19.610 --> 18:21.910
Darryl, I want to know
what's going on right now.

18:21.940 --> 18:24.880
Normally, I would lie to you,
but since it's Christmas...

18:24.910 --> 18:27.720
I decided to pose as Santa Claus

18:27.750 --> 18:29.880
to find out what you were buying me.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.990
What? I'm not on an undercover
top-secret mission?

18:34.790 --> 18:35.660
So I guess this badge is fake too?

18:37.690 --> 18:39.690
I can't believe you!

18:41.800 --> 18:45.630
Ha! You missed me
by ten feet!

18:45.670 --> 18:46.600
You hit that giant candy cane, and...

18:46.630 --> 18:47.700
Uh-oh.

18:52.010 --> 18:54.910
Rose? It's me.

18:54.940 --> 18:55.710
We're going to need another ambulance.

19:02.650 --> 19:03.920
Great!

19:03.950 --> 19:05.650
Now, where am I gonna find a Santa
Claus and an elf to fill in?

19:07.820 --> 19:11.590
Of course!
It's so obvious!

19:13.960 --> 19:16.630
This is my worst nightmare.

19:16.670 --> 19:19.600
I'm chubby and I have facial hair!

19:19.840 --> 19:22.670
I don't worry about the way that I look,

19:22.700 --> 19:23.740
I have high elf-esteem.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.650
Look! It's Santa
and the elves!

19:36.950 --> 19:38.890
And they're stealing our toys!

19:41.690 --> 19:45.930
Let's get 'em!
Orphan style!

19:45.960 --> 19:50.700
Oh, well,
we're not stealing. We're...

19:50.730 --> 19:54.900
...fixing some broken toys
from my workshop.

19:54.940 --> 19:57.810
Come on! We've got to stop these
toys before they explode!

20:12.690 --> 20:15.790
Aw, Santa! What kind of
cookies did you eat?

20:21.000 --> 20:25.800
These are the greatest toys ever!
Thank you so much!

20:27.970 --> 20:30.870
Well, I'm glad you like them.

20:30.910 --> 20:34.780
We made them in the North Pole.

20:34.810 --> 20:37.680
Yeah, we're a team here,

20:37.710 --> 20:39.950
but they were all my idea.

20:39.980 --> 20:43.950
That's not true, you filthy liar!

20:43.990 --> 20:47.890
These tags say they're from
someone named Ms. Skidmore.

20:47.920 --> 20:52.030
She must be the nicest person
in the whole wide world.

20:52.060 --> 20:53.730
What are you talking about?
She's...

20:53.760 --> 20:54.700
An angel.

20:57.030 --> 20:58.540
It's Christmas.

20:59.970 --> 21:02.700
Merry Christmas, kids!

21:11.910 --> 21:16.820
I'm so glad this Christmas we
decided to buy something together,

21:16.850 --> 21:18.820
for the both of us.
Mmm.

21:18.850 --> 21:20.860
I love this hammock.

21:20.890 --> 21:23.720
Yeah. Too bad they were out
of the self-rocking ones.

21:26.860 --> 21:29.720
How much longer do I have to do this?

21:30.980 --> 21:33.890
All right.
Go on, Cameron, open your present.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.420
Aw, that's so cute!

21:51.040 --> 21:52.430
This is my present?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.710
Remember when you were telling
Santa what you wanted,

21:55.840 --> 21:57.690
and you thought I wasn't listening?

21:57.730 --> 21:58.730
Look in the box.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.870
Two tickets to the 49ers game!

22:05.900 --> 22:07.600
Dad, I love it!

22:10.400 --> 22:13.310
Mom, me and you are going to a football game.

22:19.980 --> 22:22.140
Okay. Well, Daddy,

22:22.180 --> 22:24.170
now you've got to open
your present from me.

22:24.210 --> 22:25.480
Ah!

22:26.160 --> 22:27.400
My baby.

22:27.490 --> 22:30.140
It's a gift card for your
favorite restaurant.

22:30.300 --> 22:34.250
The hospital cafeteria!
I love it! Thank you, sweetie!

22:36.800 --> 22:39.050
Chyna, your turn.
Open your present.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.090
Oh, I can't wait to see what I got!

22:48.310 --> 22:50.940
You got a tuba, but I couldn't wrap it!

22:54.080 --> 22:55.580
Where's the bathroom?

22:56.670 --> 22:58.100
Right up there.

22:58.300 --> 22:59.500
