19:38.261 --> 19:40.430
Aah...

19:40.513 --> 19:42.849
Aw, so close.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.267
(crowd screaming)

19:44.351 --> 19:46.269
(Meg yelling)

19:46.353 --> 19:48.146
Peter, call an ambulance.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.940
Can you do it?
My number's blocked by 911.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.263
Come on, you can do
this. Stewie does it every day.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.765
-He does?
-Yep.

20:23.848 --> 20:25.183
Just put one hand on the rail.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.064
Damn it, I can't.

20:31.147 --> 20:32.857
Uppies.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.404
Adios, Doug.

20:37.487 --> 20:41.366
From hell's heart I stab at thee.

20:41.449 --> 20:46.496
With my last breath, I spit upon...

20:46.579 --> 20:48.498
(snoring)

20:50.667 --> 20:52.419
Ha!
What a baby.
