WEBVTT

00:01.936 --> 00:04.003
No, David,
you can't sleep over here

00:04.005 --> 00:07.039
because, um, uh, um..

00:07.041 --> 00:09.041
Tell him the house
is being painted.

00:09.043 --> 00:12.011
I told him that last time.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.712
Tell him
the basement's flooded.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.347
The basement's flooded.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.618
- Okay, bye.
- The basement's flooded?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.220
Well, why didn't
somebody tell me?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.554
No, the basement's fine.

00:22.556 --> 00:23.889
See, David wanted to sleepover

00:23.891 --> 00:25.491
and Brian was telling him
why he can't.

00:25.493 --> 00:28.460
Brian, you shouldn't lie.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.197
Hello, is the doctor in?

00:32.199 --> 00:34.266
Hello?

00:35.736 --> 00:40.806
Unless, of course, the truth has
an arrow through his head.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.274
Ha!

00:44.812 --> 00:47.813
[theme music]

00:57.158 --> 01:00.325
[no audio]

01:14.842 --> 01:17.843
[music continues]

01:48.642 --> 01:51.543
I just want you to know
how I feel about lying.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.412
Dad's always been against it.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.714
Even though there are
certain situations

01:55.716 --> 02:00.486
in which lying is not as wrong
as it is in other situations

02:00.488 --> 02:04.957
I want you to know that
lying is always wrong.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.792
You understand
what I'm saying?

02:06.794 --> 02:08.827
Do you?

02:08.829 --> 02:10.729
I'm working at it.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.733
Hey, Willie, look at this.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.303
It's a squirting flower.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.571
Am I working it right?

02:19.573 --> 02:22.841
Uh, I think you got
the basic idea.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.009
Where'd you get that?

02:24.011 --> 02:27.613
I sent away for a whole box
of this stuff.

02:27.615 --> 02:31.717
That Taiwan must be
the most fun place on Earth.

02:32.353 --> 02:33.685
[doorbell dings]

02:33.687 --> 02:36.288
Oh, ALF, uh, you better
go to the kitchen.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.258
But I didn't show
you the fake vomit.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.294
Save that for dinner.

02:42.296 --> 02:45.497
Of course, where's my mind.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.602
Don't even think about it.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.542
Oh, hello, Mrs. Ochmonek.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.310
You should really answer
the door more quickly.

02:58.312 --> 03:02.347
- I was getting ready to leave.
- I'm so sorry.

03:02.349 --> 03:05.417
You're all wet.
Is the basement flooded again?

03:06.987 --> 03:09.388
Dad was squirted by a flower.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.957
Oh, Trevor wanted to buy
one of those things.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.959
I just put my foot down.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.327
Good for you.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.562
I locked myself out.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.197
Would it be alright
if I stayed here

03:18.199 --> 03:19.531
till Trevor came home?

03:19.533 --> 03:23.302
Well, uh, I-I don't know.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.736
Can I ask you something?

03:24.738 --> 03:28.373
Why is there always
hair on your couch?

03:28.375 --> 03:30.542
Well, we, uh..

03:30.544 --> 03:33.078
Uh, we-we had a dog..

03:33.080 --> 03:35.747
...and then he ran away.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.916
Years ago.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.252
Before we knew you.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.820
Psst. Psst.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.089
What was that?

03:46.227 --> 03:48.994
Uh, that, uh..

03:48.996 --> 03:52.164
Uh-uh, that must be
the pipe acting up again.

03:52.166 --> 03:54.399
Oh, that pipe.

03:54.401 --> 03:59.571
That pipe, I-I think
I'll go wrap it in tape.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.908
[squeaking]

04:08.582 --> 04:11.483
One of the dog's old toys.

04:13.454 --> 04:14.953
What is it?

04:16.223 --> 04:17.689
What?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.933
[laughing]

04:29.403 --> 04:31.303
You amaze me.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.406
You're 229 years old

04:34.408 --> 04:36.575
and<i> that's</i> what
you think is funny?

04:36.577 --> 04:38.477
Can we talk about this
some other time?

04:38.479 --> 04:41.780
I have to make number four.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.650
Uh, how am I supposed
to get rid of Mrs. Ochmonek?

04:44.652 --> 04:47.819
I don't know, tell her about
that interesting fishing trip

04:47.821 --> 04:51.023
you went on with your father.
That'll do it.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.927
Oh, hey, Willie, come here.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.062
Yeah.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.732
[laughing]

05:02.336 --> 05:04.036
Oh, I kill me.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.007
- You're all wet again.
- Uh, yeah. I, uh..

05:09.009 --> 05:12.177
- Did another pipe burst?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.845
That's right, yeah, yeah.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.681
Right, oh-oh,
uh, Mrs. Ochmonek

05:15.683 --> 05:17.082
uh, would you mind, uh, uh, uh

05:17.084 --> 05:19.351
facing the door
just for a moment, please?

05:19.353 --> 05:20.752
Why?

05:22.956 --> 05:24.656
Oh, I don't know.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.927
I think, I'll wait for Trevor
by the curb.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.199
[Willie sighs]

05:35.536 --> 05:39.071
Never mind,
the moment has passed.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.943
[instrumental music]

05:48.882 --> 05:50.916
[snoring]

05:51.485 --> 05:53.685

[snoring]

06:01.128 --> 06:02.394
[beeping]

06:02.396 --> 06:03.562
ALF.

06:03.564 --> 06:06.164
- ALF.
- What? What? What?

06:06.166 --> 06:07.499
What are you doing?

06:07.501 --> 06:10.535
Well, I was sleeping
'til you woke me up!

06:10.537 --> 06:14.039
Well, since when do you
sleep standing up?

06:14.041 --> 06:18.543
Since I started sleeping
with that box on my head.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.812
You look ridiculous.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.548
Well, not everyone
sleeps like you.

06:23.550 --> 06:27.085
Mouth open,
drooling on the pillow.

06:30.023 --> 06:33.158
How do you know
how I look when I sleep?

06:33.160 --> 06:37.095
I go into your bedroom at night
and watch you and Kate.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.231
I don't like you doing that.

06:39.233 --> 06:41.900
Well, hey, you were watching me.

06:41.902 --> 06:45.537
I couldn't sleep. I came out
to get a glass of milk.

06:45.539 --> 06:48.774
I heard you.. Ah!

06:48.776 --> 06:51.943
Oh, good, it works.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.112
ALF, there are
tacks on the floor.

06:54.114 --> 06:58.583
It's my alarm system,
in case a burglar shows up.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.621
Getting one of your
headaches again?

07:02.623 --> 07:05.624
You know what's
good for that? Jogging.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.459
I've been doing
a lot of it lately.

07:07.461 --> 07:10.028
I don't think jogging
is the answer.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.198
You've been jogging?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.767
Yeah, you can really
see the definition

07:15.769 --> 07:17.702
in my thigh muscles.

07:18.705 --> 07:22.274
You actually go outside

07:22.276 --> 07:26.044
in the street
where people can see you?

07:26.046 --> 07:30.215
I jog at night.
And I wear a dark headband.

07:32.653 --> 07:36.321
Um, uh, I'm gonna go back
to bed and drool..

07:36.323 --> 07:38.557
[screaming]

07:50.237 --> 07:51.903
[Kate sighs]

07:51.905 --> 07:53.672
Did you get your milk?

07:53.674 --> 07:57.042
No, I stepped on the tack.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.915
Do these things
ever get to you?

08:03.917 --> 08:07.252
No, I-I usually wear slippers.

08:07.254 --> 08:11.990
I'm talking about...
the things ALF does.

08:11.992 --> 08:14.626
You know, tacks
on the floor

08:14.628 --> 08:17.028
jogging, hair on the couch

08:17.030 --> 08:20.599
squirting flowers,
fish in the dryer.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.368
When did he put
fish in the dryer?

08:23.370 --> 08:27.606
Well, he hasn't...yet.

08:27.608 --> 08:31.176
You know, you could
talk to someone about ALF.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.613
I thought I was.

08:34.615 --> 08:37.115
No, no, no, I mean,
someone outside the family

08:37.117 --> 08:39.017
somebody who's not
so close to the thing.

08:39.019 --> 08:44.623
But that's just the point, Kate,
I can't tell anyone about ALF.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.892
How about Larry?
He's a psychologist.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.828
- A psychologist? Kate--
- No, no, no,

08:49.830 --> 08:53.198
I mean, you can trust him. He's
not allowed to tell anyone.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.034
Oh, I don't know. Ah..

08:56.036 --> 08:58.803
- I-I'll think about it.
- Okay.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.171
Now, we gotta get some sleep.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.707
Now, I gotta get up
early in the morning

09:02.709 --> 09:04.409
get a tetanus shot.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.682
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.752
I thought you guys
would be asleep.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.156
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to give Larry a call.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.068
What are you lookin' at?

09:33.874 --> 09:37.042
Well, Mr. O'Hara,
I'll see you next week, okay?

09:37.044 --> 09:39.844
And, uh, on your way home, keep
telling yourself over and over

09:39.846 --> 09:43.315
there's no such thing
as a space creature.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.052
- Hi, Willie.
- Hi, Larr.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.553
- I'm next.
- Uh..

09:48.555 --> 09:51.089
You still have ten minutes
before your session. Come on in.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.724
I don't wanna take up
any of your time.

09:52.726 --> 09:55.093
- You mean, my time.
- Come on in.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.332
In nine minutes,
I'm comin' in there.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.936
Hey, Willie.
Whoa, whoa, what's that?

10:04.938 --> 10:07.238
Hey, come on, what's that?

10:07.240 --> 10:08.873
Hey, what brings you
to these parts, huh?

10:08.875 --> 10:10.375
Oh, I don't know,
uh, nothing much.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.144
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood and..

10:13.146 --> 10:16.381
Gosh, I thought that
all psychologists had couches.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.650
Well, I used to have one,
but I kept falling asleep on it.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.852
[laughing]

10:22.322 --> 10:25.724
Well, I guess, I, uh,
I guess I oughta be going.

10:25.726 --> 10:26.992
No, well, why don't you
wait outside?

10:26.994 --> 10:28.159
I'll finish this session and, uh

10:28.161 --> 10:29.894
we can have lunch together.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.164
Hey, Willie,
is everything alright?

10:33.166 --> 10:34.232
Yeah.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.936
- Anything on your mind?
- No, no.

10:37.938 --> 10:40.005
- No problems at home?
- No, no.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.141
Just the usual, you know,
nothing, nothing major

10:43.143 --> 10:46.344
nothing, nothing really out of..

10:48.815 --> 10:52.017
I have a creature
from outer space living with me.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.487
[laughing]

10:57.024 --> 10:59.290
Well, there's a lot
of that going around.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.525
Sit down.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.094
This is ALF.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.532
It's not really a..
It's not a very good picture.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.437
I know I should be..

11:12.439 --> 11:14.039
I should really be thrilled
having someone

11:14.041 --> 11:16.007
as extraordinary as
that living with me

11:16.009 --> 11:21.846
but believe me,
it-it has its drawbacks.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.315
Uh-uh, he's got some
wonderful qualities

11:24.317 --> 11:25.884
I admit that, but he..

11:25.886 --> 11:30.221
Uh, he can be, well...irksome.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.723
'You know, one minute
he's explaining'

11:31.725 --> 11:34.125
the mysteries of the universe
and the next minute

11:34.127 --> 11:37.295
he's putting
fake vomit on my pillow.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.400
I-I don't know anymore, Larry.

11:42.402 --> 11:46.705
Uh, as a friend,
what do you think?

11:46.707 --> 11:48.907
I think I want my couch back.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.981
Well, Larry, there's really
no need for you to come over.

11:56.983 --> 11:58.483
Come on, I wanna help.
I wanna help.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.019
I'm a psychologist.
Anyway, I wanna meet this thing.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.854
Alright, but..

12:02.856 --> 12:05.557
...don't call him a-a thing.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.093
He-he's really very sensitive.

12:09.696 --> 12:10.929
You're talking about me,
aren't you?

12:10.931 --> 12:12.530
No, we weren't.
No, we weren't.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.600
That figures, nobody ever talks
about me, Dr. Dykstra

12:15.602 --> 12:19.003
except me, and I have to
pay you to listen to it.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.079
[instrumental music]

12:28.081 --> 12:30.181
Oh, Brian, uh,
would you get ALF?

12:30.183 --> 12:33.518
- I think he's in the garage.
- Okay.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.254
I wanted to, uh,
sort of prepare ALF

12:36.256 --> 12:37.856
a little before
Larry gets here.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.190
Mm-hmm.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.725
I think that ALF
will like Larry.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.961
Well, I bet,
Larry'll like ALF.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.463
This isn't a blind date.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.899
Larry's coming over
here to observe

12:47.901 --> 12:49.367
and to make suggestions

12:49.369 --> 12:52.971
about how we can
better deal with ALF.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.207
Oh, look, another
fly in the ice cube.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.609
ALF's really getting
his money's worth

12:57.611 --> 12:59.144
out of this joke kit.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.914
Can you make this fast?

13:02.916 --> 13:05.650
I'm in the middle
of drying fish.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.619
Where?

13:07.621 --> 13:09.487
Out on the back porch. Why?

13:09.489 --> 13:11.823
I was just wondering.

13:11.825 --> 13:15.326
ALF, we have
a little surprise.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.662
Don't tell me you're serving
Lucky for dinner.

13:17.664 --> 13:21.800
Because if you are
I want to rent a tux.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.335
No, ALF, we're having
a guest over.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.905
Oh, I get it,
and the surprise is

13:26.907 --> 13:29.073
I have to stay
hidden all evening.

13:29.075 --> 13:33.745
No, actually, the guest
is coming here to see you.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.747
Uh-huh. I see.

13:35.749 --> 13:37.949
- You do?
- Oh, sure.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.450
You never let anyone
see me before

13:39.452 --> 13:42.287
and suddenly you
invite someone over.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.189
It's obvious what's happening.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.758
This guy's from
the Alien Task Force.

13:46.760 --> 13:48.359
You people are turning me in!

13:48.361 --> 13:52.497
Oh, ALF, no, the man's
an old friend of mine.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.165
He's a psychologist.

13:54.167 --> 13:59.337
I assure you, you-you have
nothing to worry about.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.605
Okay, let's eat.

14:00.607 --> 14:04.542
Uh, no, no, I wanted to wait
until Larry gets here.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.211
Well, is this guy always late?

14:06.213 --> 14:08.713
No, he'll be here.
He'll be here any minute.

14:08.715 --> 14:11.850
You're gonna have to chew
with your mouth closed tonight.

14:11.852 --> 14:17.956
Alright. But on my planet
that's considered very rude!

14:17.958 --> 14:20.658
People think you're
hiding something.

14:20.660 --> 14:25.129
ALF, um, do you know
what a psychologist is?

14:25.131 --> 14:28.399
Sure, I know
all about psychology.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.736
I used to watch
the old "Bob Newhart Show."

14:32.873 --> 14:35.240
So why is this guy Larry
coming over?

14:35.242 --> 14:38.409
He's-he's going
to observe things.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.978
- Observe things?
- Mm-hmm.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.512
Like what?

14:41.514 --> 14:44.549
(Willie)
Well, like how
the family, how..

14:46.586 --> 14:48.253
How the family interacts

14:48.255 --> 14:50.755
uh, how-how we
get along together.

14:50.757 --> 14:54.759
Oh, what's he gonna do?
Put me under a microscope?

14:54.761 --> 14:57.161
Analyze everything I say?

14:57.163 --> 14:59.497
Ask me questions
about my childhood?

14:59.499 --> 15:00.498
[doorbell dings]

15:00.500 --> 15:03.268
- Oh, no!
- ALF, calm down.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.771
Right, right, calm, calm.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.106
I'm calm.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.742
Yeah, yeah,
Larry's not gonna think

15:10.744 --> 15:13.611
I'm the crazy one.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.281
- Uh, hi, Larry.
- Hi, Willie, how are you?

15:16.283 --> 15:18.082
Hey, you're lookin' great.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.152
Hi, Kate. Oh, my God!

15:24.224 --> 15:26.291
I take it he's the alien?

15:28.962 --> 15:30.695
Hiya, Larry.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.769
Nice firm handshake
I've got there, huh?

15:37.771 --> 15:39.570
Good sign, right?

15:39.572 --> 15:43.308
ALF, don't kiss up.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.643
Uh, Lynnie, why don't you
go check the pork chops?

15:45.645 --> 15:47.345
Okay. Come on, Bri.

15:49.416 --> 15:52.717
So, uh, what do you
think of our planet?

15:52.719 --> 15:54.719
Oh, I like it a lot, Larry.

15:54.721 --> 16:00.158
I just wish there was
more love and less war.

16:00.160 --> 16:03.661
Not something
a psychotic would say, right?

16:03.663 --> 16:06.064
- Oh, ALF.
- What?

16:07.000 --> 16:11.169
So, uh, what's new
in your life, Larry?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.437
Oh, uh, nothing.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.239
Still packing them
four deep on the couch.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.075
Four deep on the couch!

16:17.077 --> 16:19.744
[laughing]

16:21.081 --> 16:24.148
I think we get the point, ALF.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.584
- Dinner's ready.
- Oh, good.

16:26.586 --> 16:31.589
After a hearty laugh like that,
it's time for a hearty meal.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.292
Every meal's
a hearty meal for ALF.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.628
Wait till you see this guy eat.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.932
Why don't we let our guest
sit at the head of the table?

16:40.934 --> 16:45.269
(Willie)
My, aren't we polite,
all of a sudden.

16:45.271 --> 16:48.039
Well, everything
looks lovely, Kate.

16:48.041 --> 16:50.708
You've outdone yourself again.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.876
Thank you.

16:51.878 --> 16:55.046
Excuse me, but can
someone please pass me

16:55.048 --> 16:58.182
the white boiled potatoes?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.051
Did ALF say please?

17:00.053 --> 17:02.286
Did ALF say pass?

17:02.288 --> 17:05.323
Come on, Larry, chow down.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.226
ALF loves to chow down.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.395
I have a healthy appetite.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.130
Nothing wrong with that,
is there?

17:12.132 --> 17:13.831
No.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.500
See, Willie?

17:15.502 --> 17:17.001
I didn't say
anything was wrong.

17:17.003 --> 17:18.903
I was just making a comment.

17:18.905 --> 17:23.908
People don't just make comments,
they mean things by them.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.476
Right, Larr?

17:27.013 --> 17:28.980
[burping]

17:28.982 --> 17:30.581
ALF, please.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.750
Just making some room
for the meal.

17:32.752 --> 17:36.754
That's not something
one does at the dinner table.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.924
I'm sorry, Larry.
Where are my manners?

17:39.926 --> 17:42.493
You don't have any manners.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.928
Well, you know,
in some countries

17:43.930 --> 17:46.197
it's considered a compliment
if you burp after eating.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.665
Oh, yes, yes.

17:47.667 --> 17:52.403
Sometimes ALF can be
very,<i> very</i> complimentary.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.540
So, Larr, what do you think
about this Nicaragua thing?

17:55.542 --> 17:59.343
ALF, why are you talking
about Nicaragua?

17:59.345 --> 18:02.447
We always discuss politics
at the table.

18:02.449 --> 18:06.117
No, we<i> never</i> discuss politics
at the dinner table.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.919
We discuss hair in the food

18:07.921 --> 18:10.455
we discuss what appliances
you've broken.

18:10.457 --> 18:12.390
I'm sorry, Larry,
this is really

18:12.392 --> 18:16.394
this is not at all the way
ALF normally behaves.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.564
Oh, how do I behave?

18:19.566 --> 18:22.633
Well, generally, you do
disgusting, gross things.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.903
Uh-uh, go on, then, show him.
D-do something disgusting.

18:25.905 --> 18:29.474
(Brian)
Yeah, make milk come
through your nose.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.442
Brian, don't encourage him.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.911
Would you like some more
potatoes? They're very tasty.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.482
He doesn't care about potatoes.
Show him the vomit.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.553
Willie, please,
I'm trying to eat.

18:42.555 --> 18:46.157
Honestly, Larry, it-it isn't
always quite like this.

18:46.159 --> 18:48.326
I have a little exercise
that might work, guys.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.927
It's called role reversal.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.598
Now, Willie, you become ALF,
and ALF becomes Willie.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.399
That sounds like a good idea.

18:55.401 --> 18:58.336
Oh, I-I-I don't think so.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.605
Afraid of a little
personal growth, perhaps?

19:00.607 --> 19:05.109
No, I am not afraid. I just..
I-I think it's silly.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.678
Come on, Willie, give it a try.
Larry knows what he's doing.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.348
Yeah, come on, dad, ALF
does a great impression of you.

19:10.350 --> 19:13.484
Oh, alright.
We wouldn't want to miss<i> that.</i>

19:13.486 --> 19:16.020
Okay, since, uh,
since we're at the dinner table

19:16.022 --> 19:18.356
let's just act like
we would at the dinner table

19:18.358 --> 19:21.659
and we can start off by you,
Willie, being ALF.

19:23.463 --> 19:26.330
[imitating ALF]
Food, food, give me more food!

19:26.332 --> 19:29.534
Oh, I haven't had a meal in,
oh, a half an hour.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.902
Ha!

19:32.038 --> 19:34.705
Oh, no, ALF. No, no.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.207
No food for you.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.609
You already ate last month.

19:39.812 --> 19:43.381
No, no, no.
I don't sound like that.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.782
Oh, come on, Willie,
you're doing fine.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.852
- Come on, keep going.
- Alright.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.387
[imitates ALF burping]

19:49.389 --> 19:50.888
[imitating ALF]
I've finished my meal. Uh..

19:50.890 --> 19:55.960
I guess I'll watch TV, while
everybody else does the dishes.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.564
[imitating Willie]
I think we watch enough TV
in this house.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.733
We should do something
more stimulating.

20:02.735 --> 20:07.305
I know, let's conjugate verbs.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.073
[imitating ALF]
No, how about..

20:09.075 --> 20:12.710
How about we just break things?

20:12.712 --> 20:15.913
[imitating Willie]
Oh, no, no. That would be wrong.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.016
Wro..<i> Wrong!</i>

20:19.018 --> 20:21.719
[imitating ALF]
Alright, then,
how about if we, um

20:21.721 --> 20:24.088
how about if we eat
the cat, then?

20:24.090 --> 20:26.791
How ya doin', Lucky?

20:29.696 --> 20:33.564
[imitating Willie]
Sorry, household rule number 856

20:33.566 --> 20:36.601
subsection D, paragraph two

20:36.603 --> 20:39.670
"We do not eat the cat."

20:39.672 --> 20:42.206
[imitating ALF]
Uh, rules, schmules.
I hate rules.

20:42.208 --> 20:45.710
I like.. I like anarchy.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.612
[imitating Willie]
Well, I don't
believe in anarchy.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.615
It's much too spontaneous.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.883
Oh, look, look how
late it's getting

20:52.885 --> 20:55.219
and I still have
to lay out my clothes

20:55.221 --> 20:58.089
for the rest of the year.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.290
That's it. This isn't helping.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.459
- I quit.
- I win.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.628
ALF, there are no winners
in this thing.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.697
- Well, I was ahead on points.
- That's not true.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.199
Well, I think I've heard enough.

21:08.201 --> 21:10.468
I mean, you guys obviously
don't get along, okay?

21:10.470 --> 21:13.304
I-I think, uh,
ALF should move out.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.139
- Move out?
- Move out?

21:15.141 --> 21:16.741
What does he mean, move out?

21:16.743 --> 21:18.709
Are you sayin' that ALF
should get a place of his own?

21:18.711 --> 21:22.947
Well, that-that's crazy.
Do you know what rents are?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.482
What am I talking about?

21:24.484 --> 21:27.618
You can move in with me.
I've got an extra room.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.820
ALF, you're not going anywhere.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.322
Why not?

21:31.324 --> 21:33.457
Because people
would find him out.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.059
Why do you care?

21:35.061 --> 21:37.561
Well, I don't want
anything to happen to him.

21:37.563 --> 21:41.265
Uh-huh. You do care
what happens to ALF.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.334
Well, of course I care.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.670
I always did.

21:45.672 --> 21:50.975
I-I-I just think that sometimes,
it seems that..

21:50.977 --> 21:55.446
...that ALF doesn't care
a heck of a lot about me.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.581
Not care?

21:57.583 --> 22:00.017
Not care about the guy
who's protected me

22:00.019 --> 22:05.423
and provided for me
for all these months?

22:05.425 --> 22:08.192
You-you appreciated all of that?

22:08.194 --> 22:10.594
Of course, I appreciate it.

22:10.596 --> 22:13.998
Hey, if you got
a problem, let's talk.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.035
I mean, if fake vomit's
not your cup of tea

22:18.037 --> 22:19.370
I'll lose it.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.639
Oh, yeah, I'd appreciate that.

22:21.641 --> 22:24.975
And, uh, in return,
I'll-I'll, uh..

22:24.977 --> 22:30.047
...I'll-I'll really try
to be...more flexible.

22:30.049 --> 22:33.617
Hey, see what a little
communication can do?

22:33.619 --> 22:37.455
Well, I think we've all become
a little closer here.

22:37.457 --> 22:40.224
We should toast this occasion.

22:40.226 --> 22:42.159
(Kate)
That's a good idea.

22:42.161 --> 22:44.862
Now, come on, dad, make a toast.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.564
Well, uh..

22:46.566 --> 22:50.501
Alright, uh, to, to, uh..

22:50.503 --> 22:51.969
Communication.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.538
[chuckles]
Communication.

23:01.647 --> 23:04.749
And to, uh, dribble glasses.

23:04.751 --> 23:05.983
Ha!

23:09.088 --> 23:12.123
[all laughing]

23:19.565 --> 23:23.367
[groans]
Oh, hi, ALF.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.835
Hi, Willie.

23:27.039 --> 23:29.006
Night, ALF.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.674
Night, Willie.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.283
[instrumental music]

23:44.690 --> 23:47.858
[theme music]

24:11.651 --> 24:14.552
[ALF laughing]
