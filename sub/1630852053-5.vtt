01:28.121 --> 01:31.858
FUN FACT ABOUT TARIK, HE IS

THAT IS A HIGH ENERGY NIGHT OF
IMPROVISED MUSIC CALLED

01:39.099 --> 01:44.437
I AM.
AND ANOTHER FUN FACT IS THAT AT

01:44.437 --> 01:47.107
"FREESTYLE LOVE SUPREME" WE HAVE
GUEST PERFORMERS.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.776

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.

02:22.575 --> 02:26.212
I DIDN'T REALLY THINK WE
WOULD GET ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS

02:26.212 --> 02:38.658
ON THE SHOW, THAT IS REALLY FUN.
IT'S A GOOD FEELING.

02:38.658 --> 02:44.264
I KNOW WHY SHE DOES THAT NOW.
WE HAVE TO GET MORE STUFF TO

02:44.264 --> 02:46.700
GIVE AWAY.
EVERYONE GETS A FREE BOTTLE

02:46.700 --> 02:49.002

[ APPLAUSE ]

02:49.002 --> 02:52.472
YOU DO NOT, I DO NOT HAVE
THAT POWER.

02:52.472 --> 02:56.443
BUT WE COULD PROBABLY FIND A
BOTTLE OF WATER IN BETWEEN NOW

02:56.443 --> 03:00.914
AND THEN.
YEAH.

03:00.914 --> 03:04.617
YOU GUYS, IT HAS BEEN --
DON'T YOU THROW THAT BOTTLE OF

03:04.617 --> 03:07.320
WATER.
YOU GUYS, IT HAS BEEN A CRAZY

03:07.320 --> 03:09.456
WEEK IN AMERICA.
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.591
NEW YORK GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL
SIGNED A BILL THIS WEEK THAT

03:11.591 --> 03:13.727
REQUIRES ALL USED CARS TO HAVE
WORKING AIRBAGS.

03:13.727 --> 03:17.497
THE ISSUE IS CLOSE TO HER HEART
BECAUSE SHE SPENT YEARS WORKING

03:17.497 --> 03:24.938
ALONGSIDE A WORKING AIRBAG.
AMAZON RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT

03:24.938 --> 03:30.844
FULLY VACCINATED EMPLOYEES CAN
STOP WEARING FACE MASKS AT WORK.

03:30.844 --> 03:35.382
BUT THEY'LL STILL BE REQUIRED TO
WEAR A BALL AND CHAIN.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.618
THAT'S AMAZON.
IT WAS ANNOUNCED THIS WEEK THAT

03:38.618 --> 03:41.855
THE DONALD J. TRUMP HIGHWAY
BEAUTIFICATION SIGN IN NEW

03:41.855 --> 03:44.491

REMOVED.

03:44.491 --> 03:52.399
BUT JUST FOR FUN, LET'S ALL SAY
IT'S BEING EVICTED.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.868

THANK YOU.
PRESIDENT BIDEN'S BEHAVIOR AT

04:22.228 --> 04:25.432
THE RECENT U.N. SUMMIT WAS
IMPROPER AND APPALLING.

04:25.432 --> 04:40.347
IT IS COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE
FOR A HEAD OF STATE TO --

04:40.347 --> 04:44.084
YOU WERE SAYING?
I WAS SAYING THAT IT IS

04:44.084 --> 04:52.625
COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE FOR
A -- IT IS COMPLETELY -- IT

04:52.625 --> 05:10.810
IS -- IT --
WHAT WAS THAT?

05:10.810 --> 05:17.784
WHAT WAS WHAT?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEAVE?

05:17.784 --> 05:20.420
VERY MUCH SO, YES.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, HER

05:20.420 --> 05:24.057
ROYAL MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH
II.

05:24.057 --> 05:35.568
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
I TRIED.

05:35.568 --> 05:41.541
I COULDN'T MAKE IT.
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME I'VE

05:41.541 --> 05:44.344
MADE IT THROUGH THAT BIT.
OKAY, MOVING ON.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.446
MUSICIAN MISSY ELLIOTT RECEIVED
A STAR THIS WEEK ON THE

05:46.446 --> 05:48.615
HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME.
BUT SADLY, THEY FLIPPED IT AND

05:48.615 --> 06:00.460
REVERSED IT.
[ APPLAUSE ]

06:00.460 --> 06:02.629
I CAN'T.
OH, MY GOSH.

06:02.629 --> 06:08.468
TARIK IS CRYING REAL TEARS.
SOMETIMES FARTS MAKE YOU CRY

06:08.468 --> 06:10.670
REAL TEARS.
YOU GUYS,

06:10.670 --> 06:13.340
A COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME IN
ARIZONA WAS PAUSED LAST WEEKEND

06:13.340 --> 06:18.845
AFTER A FOX RAN ONTO THE FIELD.
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN.

06:18.845 --> 06:29.055

LOS ANGELES RESIDENTS THIS WEEK

06:31.358 --> 06:32.959
HAD TO SHOW PROOF OF VACCINATION
TO EAT IN RESTAURANTS.

06:32.959 --> 06:47.073
SAID PEOPLE IN LOS ANGELES, "OH,
I DON'T EAT."

06:47.073 --> 06:50.343
* THEY PUT MY BODY ON A NICE
TINY FIGURE *

06:50.343 --> 06:53.079
AND FINALLY, ONLINE SEARCHES FOR
"MEN'S SHAPEWEAR" HAVE

06:53.079 --> 06:55.148
REPORTEDLY INCREASED BY 156%.
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY TARIK'S WAIST

06:55.148 --> 07:02.589
IS SO SNATCHED.
[ APPLAUSE ]

07:02.589 --> 07:08.895
AND THAT WAS THE MONOLOGUE.
DID YOU LIKE THAT MONOLOGUE,

07:08.895 --> 07:11.631
TARIK?
YEAH, SURE.

07:11.631 --> 07:15.201
TARIK IN A LITTLE CORSET,
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE INTO THAT

07:15.201 --> 07:18.038
BUT YOU ARE NOW.
NOW, WE'RE DONE WITH THE

07:18.038 --> 07:19.806
MONOLOGUE BUT WE'RE NOT DONE
WITH THE NEWS.

07:19.806 --> 07:25.111
THIS WEEK, "PEOPLE" MAGAZINE
ANNOUNCED 2021'S SEXIEST MAN

07:25.111 --> 07:31.651
ALIVE WHICH TO EVERYONE'S SHOCK
AND SURPRISE IS NOT CHRIS EVANS.

07:31.651 --> 07:32.552
WAIT.
I'M SORRY.

07:32.552 --> 07:35.855
WHO IS THIS?
THAT'S CHRIS EVANS.

07:35.855 --> 07:37.590
SORRY, EVERYBODY.
THIS IS JENNY.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.293
SHE'S MY HEAD WRITER.
SHE CHOOSES THE PICTURES THAT GO

07:40.293 --> 07:43.630
OVER MY SHOULDER.
JENNY, THIS IS NOT CHRIS EVANS.

07:43.630 --> 07:50.103
OH, RIGHT, CHRIS EVANS.
YOU WANTED CHRIS EVANS.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.406
WHO IS --
VERY HANDSOME ACTOR NAMED

07:53.406 --> 07:54.507
CHRIS.
RIGHT.

07:54.507 --> 07:58.078
HANDSOME ACTOR NAMED CHRIS.
FOUND IT.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.580
THAT'S CHRIS PRATT.
OH.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.916
FOUND IT.
THAT'S CHRIS PINE.

08:02.916 --> 08:06.419
FOUND IT.
THAT'S CHRISTOPHER LLOYD.

08:06.419 --> 08:09.456
YOU WERE CLOSER THE FIRST TIME.
RIGHT, RIGHT.

08:09.456 --> 08:12.392
OKAY.
I KNEW THAT.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.894
HANDSOME CHRIS, COMING RIGHT UP.
HIM?

08:14.894 --> 08:18.398
THAT'S CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.
HIM.

08:18.398 --> 08:22.135
THAT'S KRIS KRINGLE.
HIM?

08:22.135 --> 08:24.804
THAT'S WHITE JESUS CHRIST.
HIM?

08:24.804 --> 08:26.906
NOW YOU'RE JUST DOING ANY OLD
THING.

08:26.906 --> 08:29.042
HIM?
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

08:29.042 --> 08:30.310
HIM.
NO.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.511
HIM.
NO.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.046

NO.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.948
HIM.
NO.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.217
HIM.
JENNY, WHAT IS HAPPENING?

08:37.217 --> 08:45.125
ALL RIGHT, FINE, I'M SORRY!
LOOK, I'M GAY, WHICH YOU KNOW

08:45.125 --> 08:48.728
BECAUSE I'VE TOLD YOU.
AND BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING YOU

08:48.728 --> 08:51.064
WEAR AND SAY?
RIGHT.

08:51.064 --> 08:56.236
WELL, BECAUSE I'M GAY, I CAN'T
TELL MEN APART.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.537
WHAT?
THEY ALL LOOK EXACTLY THE

08:57.537 --> 09:02.809
SAME TO ME.
BETWEEN THEIR NECK AND THEIR

09:02.809 --> 09:04.744
HAIRLINE IT'S JUST A BLANK
SPACE.

09:04.744 --> 09:07.180
SO YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO
CHRIS EVANS IS?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.149
NO.
TO QUOTE THE GREAT KEKE PALMER,

09:09.149 --> 09:13.853
SORRY TO THIS MAN.
[ APPLAUSE ]

09:13.853 --> 09:18.925
OKAY.
BUT THEN CAN YOU TELL THESE TWO

09:18.925 --> 09:22.295
MEN APART?
THAT'S TWO IDENTICAL TWINS.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.031
JENNY, THAT'S RYAN REYNOLDS
AND YOUR DAD.

09:25.031 --> 09:30.337
I DON'T SEE IT.
THAT EXPLAINS THE GRAPHIC.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.839
HONESTLY, IT'S FINE.
ONCE YOU'VE SEEN ONE MAN, YOU'VE

09:32.839 --> 09:34.708
SEEN THEM ALL.
BUT WAIT.

09:34.708 --> 09:39.045
YOU CAN SEE TARIK'S FACE, RIGHT?
OH, YEAH.

09:39.045 --> 09:42.048
I CAN FOR SURE SEE TARIK'S FACE.
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT AN ENDLESS

09:42.048 --> 09:47.053
VOID.
OH, GOOD.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.122
I'M GLAD YOU CAN SEE IT, BECAUSE
I CAN'T.

09:49.122 --> 09:52.525
WAIT, WHAT?
MOVING ON.

09:52.525 --> 09:57.731
CONGRESS THIS WEEKEND FINALLY
PASSED THE $1 TRILLION

09:57.731 --> 10:00.934
BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL.
AND WHILE THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE

10:00.934 --> 10:04.771
FUNDING FOR MORE TRADITIONAL
HARD INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, A

10:04.771 --> 10:08.074
SECOND SOFT INFRASTRUCTURE BILL
FOCUSED ON SOCIAL WELFARE AND

10:08.074 --> 10:11.011
CLIMATE CHANGE IS STILL
LANGUISHING IN CONGRESS.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.480
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
WHAT THIS COUNTRY REALLY NEEDS

10:13.480 --> 10:17.350
ARE NEW ROADS AND BRIDGES.
SORRY, THAT'S ONE OF MY

10:17.350 --> 10:19.619
WRITERS, IAN.
IAN, I DISAGREE.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.522
HARD INFRASTRUCTURE IS GREAT BUT
PERSONALLY I THINK WE NEED

10:22.522 --> 10:25.325
SOMETHING A LITTLE SOFTER.
SOFTER?

10:25.325 --> 10:33.500
HOW DO YOU MEAN?
CAN I GET A MIC?

10:33.500 --> 10:38.972
* WE NEED A LITTLE MEDICARE,
MEDICAID *

10:38.972 --> 10:43.276
* SOME PARENTAL LEAVE THAT IS
FULLY PAID *

10:43.276 --> 10:50.150
* CAN YOU DIG IT, I'M TALKING
FREE CHILDCARE AND PRE-K, FORGET

10:50.150 --> 10:53.086
IT *
* EACH AND EVERY PARENT GETS A

10:53.086 --> 10:56.756
CHILD TAX CREDIT, BABY *
OKAY, I THINK I SEE WHERE

10:56.756 --> 11:03.063
YOU'RE COMING FROM.
* TAXING MILLIONAIRES, LOWERING

11:03.063 --> 11:06.232
BEFORE YOU GO PRICES, AND WHILE
WE'RE AT IT, MIGHT SOLVE THE

11:06.232 --> 11:08.802
CLIMATE CRISIS, MMM *
OKAY.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.071
SOFT INFRASTRUCTURE DOES SOUND
PRETTY NICE.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.174
BUT FOR MY MONEY, I STILL THINK
WE NEED SOMETHING A LITTLE

11:14.174 --> 11:16.776
HARDER.
HARDER?

11:16.776 --> 11:20.880
HOW DO YOU MEAN?
CAN I GET A MIC?

11:20.880 --> 11:28.988
**
* I WANT TO PAVE MY ROAD, I WANT

11:28.988 --> 11:34.094
MY SUBWAY *
* I WANT TO FIX MY BRIDGE AND MY

11:34.094 --> 11:37.797
OLD POTHOLE *
OH, SO SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER.

11:37.797 --> 11:42.802
* I WANT A NEW HIGHWAY SYSTEM
AND I WANT THEM TO START DIGGING

11:42.802 --> 11:49.642
ON EVERY ONE OF MY TUNNELS *
OKAY, IAN, I THINK WE GET THE

11:49.642 --> 11:53.013
GIST.
* INTERNET ACCESS, PAY IT WITH

11:53.013 --> 11:56.249
MY TAXES, SOMEBODY FIX MY PIPES,
THEY'RE NASTY *

11:56.249 --> 12:00.153
OKAY, IAN.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

12:00.153 --> 12:03.089
WAS IT TOO HARD?
YEAH, IAN, THAT WAS A LITTLE

12:03.089 --> 12:05.759
TOO HARD.
SORRY.

12:05.759 --> 12:10.096
I GUESS THE LESSON IS THAT WE
NEED BOTH HARD AND SOFT

12:10.096 --> 12:14.801
INFRASTRUCTURE.
THE REAL LESSON IS NOT TO

12:14.801 --> 12:20.306
JUST BE HANDING US MICROPHONES.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JOKES

12:20.306 --> 12:29.983
THAT ARE SOFT AND HARD.

WELCOME BACK TO "THE AMBER

12:37.323 --> 12:39.859
RUFFIN SHOW."
YOU GUYS, WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

12:39.859 --> 12:42.762
THAT THERE IS A GROUP OF PEOPLE
OUT THERE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED

12:42.762 --> 12:48.535
OF EVERYTHING FROM HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS TO DEALING DRUGS TO

12:48.535 --> 12:50.437
ENABLING MURDERS?
THE GOOD NEWS IS THOSE PEOPLE

12:50.437 --> 12:53.506
ARE CURRENTLY IN PRISON.
THE BAD NEWS IS THEY AREN'T THE

12:53.506 --> 12:55.108
INMATES.
LET ME EXPLAIN IN A SEGMENT

12:55.108 --> 13:00.146
CALLED "HOW DID WE GET HERE."
TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO TALK

13:00.146 --> 13:03.550
ABOUT PRISON CONDITIONS.
AND THAT CAN BE TOUGH, BECAUSE A

13:03.550 --> 13:06.219
LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME THAT
PRISONS ARE FILLED WITH BAD

13:06.219 --> 13:08.355
PEOPLE.
SO WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT

13:08.355 --> 13:10.190
THEM.
SO LET ME GET THIS OUT OF THE

13:10.190 --> 13:12.892
WAY UP TOP.
YES, PRISONS MAY BE FILLED WITH

13:12.892 --> 13:15.929
PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE AT LEAST
ONE BAD DECISION.

13:15.929 --> 13:21.868
BUT SO ARE NICKELBACK CONCERTS
AND DIVORCE COURTS AND YET WE

13:21.868 --> 13:23.737
STILL TREAT THOSE PEOPLE LIKE
HUMAN BEINGS.

13:23.737 --> 13:25.905
SO WE NEED TO DO THE SAME FOR
PRISONERS.

13:25.905 --> 13:28.875
A FEW MONTHS AGO THE U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FILED A

13:28.875 --> 13:31.878
CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSUIT AGAINST THE
STATE OF ALABAMA.

13:31.878 --> 13:34.614
NOW, THIS IS INTERESTING FOR TWO
REASONS.

13:34.614 --> 13:38.084
FIRST, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
COULD SUE A WHOLE STATE,

13:38.084 --> 13:39.686
FRIGGING WATCH YOUR BACK,
FLORIDA.

13:39.686 --> 13:44.758
AND SECOND, BECAUSE THE LAWSUIT
SAYS ALABAMA'S POOR MANAGEMENT

13:44.758 --> 13:48.795
IS LEADING TO HOMICIDE, RAPES,
AND SERIOUS INJURIES IN ITS

13:48.795 --> 13:51.264
PRISONS.
ALABAMA HAS THE MOST VIOLENT

13:51.264 --> 13:53.400
PRISON SYSTEM IN AMERICA AND
HAVING THE MOST VIOLENT ANYTHING

13:53.400 --> 13:57.804
IN AMERICA IS A VERY BIG DEAL.
IT'S LIKE HAVING THE FLAKIEST

13:57.804 --> 14:04.544
CROISSANT IN FRANCE OR BEING THE
MOST UNHINGED PERSON IN A

14:04.544 --> 14:06.513
FACEBOOK THREAD.
I KNOW I SAID I WOULD EXPLAIN

14:06.513 --> 14:09.516
ALL THIS TO YOU BUT HONESTLY,
I'M NOT SURE THAT I CAN.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.584
THE GOOD NEWS IS I DON'T HAVE
TO.

14:11.584 --> 14:15.321
INSTEAD WE HAVE QUOTES FROM
INMATES INSIDE THE ALABAMA

14:15.321 --> 14:17.624
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS.
YOU'LL HEAR SOME TONIGHT AND

14:17.624 --> 14:23.530
THEY ARE 100% REAL.
SO LET'S START WITH THE LIVING

14:23.530 --> 14:27.534
CONDITIONS.
SAYING THAT ALABAMA PRISONS ARE

14:27.534 --> 14:34.874
OVERCROWDED IS LIKE SAYING THAT
SHONDA RHIMES' SHOWS ARE HORNY.

14:34.874 --> 14:40.213
THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN
BRENT, ALABAMA CURRENTLY HOUSES

14:40.213 --> 14:44.084
THE ELMORE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
WAS BUILT FOR 600 PEOPLE AND NOW

14:44.084 --> 14:48.121
HAVE 960 INMATES.
THERE ARE CLOWNS IN TINY CARS

14:48.121 --> 14:51.091
WHO HEAR THOSE NUMBERS AND SAY,
THAT'S TOO CROWDED.

14:51.091 --> 14:55.862
NOW, WITH THE OVERCROWDING AND
UNSANITARY CONDITIONS IN THOSE

14:55.862 --> 14:58.398
SYSTEMS, IT IS NOT SURPRISING
THAT COVID IS RAGING.

14:58.398 --> 15:03.603
ELMORE, THE FACILITY WITH 960
INMATES, HAD 191 PEOPLE TEST

15:03.603 --> 15:06.606
POSITIVE IN ONE DAY WHICH IS
HORRIFYING.

15:06.606 --> 15:11.111
USUALLY THE ONLY TIME YOU SEE
THAT MUCH ALARMING POSITIVITY IS

15:11.111 --> 15:15.048
WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING "THE SOUND
OF MUSIC."

15:15.048 --> 15:17.684
MARIA, BROWN PAPER PACKAGES,
THAT'S YOUR FAVORITE?

15:17.684 --> 15:21.788
RAISE YOUR STANDARDS, GIRL.
MARIA, I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO

15:21.788 --> 15:23.123
ME.
IF YOU MARRY HIM, YOU'LL BE

15:23.123 --> 15:25.525
DOING THE SAME JOB YOU'RE DOING
RIGHT NOW BUT FOR FREE.

15:25.525 --> 15:30.964
DON'T FALL FOR IT.
[ APPLAUSE ]

15:30.964 --> 15:34.267
AND EVEN WORSE, ONCE THE
PRISONERS GET SICK, THEY ARE

15:34.267 --> 15:37.103
OFTEN IGNORED.
ACROSS THE U.S., PRISONS HAVEN'T

15:37.103 --> 15:40.373
DONE ENOUGH TO QUARANTINE SICK
INMATES, PUTTING EVERYONE AROUND

15:40.373 --> 15:43.376
THEM IN GRAVE DANGER OF GETTING
SICK OR EVEN DYING.

15:43.376 --> 15:48.615
ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF
JUSTICE, STATISTICS, BEING

15:48.615 --> 15:51.951
INCARCERATED IN ALABAMA IS THREE
TIMES DEADLIER THAN CANCER.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.188
AND DEADLIER THAN CANCER IS ONE
OF THOSE PHRASES YOU SHOULD

15:55.188 --> 15:59.893
NEVER HAVE TO HEAR, LIKE
BLOODIER THAN "SQUID GAME" OR

15:59.893 --> 16:02.762
DUMBER THAN A KUSHNER.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT GETS WORSE

16:02.762 --> 16:06.266
BECAUSE ONE OF THE DEADLIEST
HAZARDS IN THE ALABAMA PRISON

16:06.266 --> 16:11.304
SYSTEM IS THE GUARDS THEMSELVES.
AN INMATE NAMED JAMES SAID, I'VE

16:11.304 --> 16:13.740
BEEN STABBED FOUR TIMES, I'VE
BEEN BEATEN SO MANY TIMES I

16:13.740 --> 16:15.942
CAN'T EVEN COUNT.
NONE OF THOSE STABBINGS CAME

16:15.942 --> 16:18.712
FROM AN INMATE.
NOT ONE OF THOSE BEATINGS CAME

16:18.712 --> 16:20.680
FROM AN INMATE.
NOW, IF YOU'RE THINKING MAYBE

16:20.680 --> 16:23.383
THAT PRISONER IS LYING, THAT'S
FAIR, LET'S HEAR FROM ANOTHER

16:23.383 --> 16:25.518
ONE.
LARRY SAID, THE GUARDS ARE

16:25.518 --> 16:29.122
HANDCUFFING THESE INMATES AND
BEATING THEM AND KILLING THEM.

16:29.122 --> 16:32.058
AND BJ, WHO IS INCARCERATED,
SAID OF HIS EXPERIENCE, THE

16:32.058 --> 16:35.628
PHYSICAL ABUSE IS RAMPANT.
RAPE IS EVERYWHERE.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.765
IT IS LIKE LIVING IN A ZOO.
BUT HEY, MAYBE YOU DON'T BELIEVE

16:38.765 --> 16:42.268
ANY PRISONERS.
THEN LISTEN TO THE DOJ REPORT

16:42.268 --> 16:45.338
THAT TALKS ABOUT AN OFFICER WHO
TOOK A HANDCUFFED AND COMPLIANT

16:45.338 --> 16:48.341
INMATE OUT OF AN OBSERVATION
ROOM, THREW HIM ONTO THE GROUND

16:48.341 --> 16:53.613
AND THEN PUNCHED, KICKED, AND
BEAT HIM WITH A BATON AND WHEN

16:53.613 --> 16:56.216
HE WAS FINISHED HIS SUPERVISOR,
WHO WATCHED THE WHOLE THING,

16:56.216 --> 17:03.890
SAID "THAT'S FAIR."
I WANT TO LOOK AT YOU RIGHT NOW

17:03.890 --> 17:10.196
AND SAY THIS ISN'T WHO WE ARE,
AMERICA, BUT THIS IS EXACTLY WHO

17:10.196 --> 17:12.766
WE ARE.
IF THIS HAD HAPPENED IN A ZOO,

17:12.766 --> 17:16.670
PEOPLE WOULD BE RIOTING IN THE
STREETS TO MAKE SURE IT NEVER

17:16.670 --> 17:20.173
HAPPENS AGAIN.
DON'T LET A WHITE PERSON HEAR

17:20.173 --> 17:22.642
ABOUT A SAD GIRAFFE, THEY WILL
LOSE THEIR MINDS.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.545
I KNOW SOME OF YOU MIGHT BE
SAYING, THIS SOUNDS TERRIBLE BUT

17:25.545 --> 17:29.049
WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH ME?
FIRST OF ALL, THE ALABAMA PRISON

17:29.049 --> 17:32.952
SYSTEM IS THE WORST EXAMPLE.
BUT PRISONS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

17:32.952 --> 17:36.523
HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES.
BUT UH-OH, NOW THAT THEY'RE

17:36.523 --> 17:40.527
USING FEDERAL MONEY TO BUILD
INVESTOR.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.063
AND THAT MEANS YOU GET A SAY.
SO HOW CAN YOU MAKE A

17:43.063 --> 17:46.399
DIFFERENCE?
THE GOOD NEWS IS, THERE ARE

17:46.399 --> 17:48.301
ALREADY PEOPLE WORKING ON THESE
ISSUES.

17:48.301 --> 17:51.171
YOU CAN DONATE YOUR TIME OR
MONEY TO PLACES LIKE THE EQUAL

17:51.171 --> 17:53.473
JUSTICE INITIATIVE AND IF YOU
SPECIFICALLY WANT TO HELP

17:53.473 --> 17:58.244
ALABAMA INMATES, DONATE TO THE
ALABAMA APPLE SEED CENTER FOR

17:58.244 --> 18:01.848
LAW AND JUSTICE.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE CAN'T

18:01.848 --> 18:04.918
JUST LOOK AWAY BECAUSE THESE ARE
OUR COUSINS AND OUR UNCLES AND

18:04.918 --> 18:08.254
OUR FATHERS AND OUR SONS.
IT'S US.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.324
HELL, IT COULD BE ME.
I HAVE A BESTSELLING BOOK, TWO

18:11.324 --> 18:16.629
TV JOBS AND MY OWN SHOW.
BUT EVERY DAY I KNOW IF I CROSS

18:16.629 --> 18:20.667
PATHS WITH POLICE OFFICERS WHO
ARE HAVING A BAD DAY AND LOOKING

18:20.667 --> 18:24.270
FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE IT OUT ON,
I'LL BE IN JAIL TOMORROW.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.173
AMERICA'S PRISON PROBLEM IS NOT
SOME DISTANT PROBLEM.

18:27.173 --> 18:29.843
IT'S OUR PROBLEM.
I KNOW I SAID I WOULD EXPLAIN

18:29.843 --> 18:32.612
ALL THIS BUT IN THIS ONE CASE I
DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW WE GOT

18:32.612 --> 18:33.613
HERE.
I JUST KNOW IT'S TIME TO GET

18:33.613 --> 18:39.552
OUT.
[ APPLAUSE ]

18:39.552 --> 18:43.723
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
SOME NONSENSE.

18:43.723 --> 18:56.603
STICK AROUND, WON'T YOU?
**

18:56.603 --> 18:58.672
WELCOME BACK TO "THE AMBER
RUFFIN SHOW."

18:58.672 --> 19:01.241
YOU KNOW, GUYS, I WAS READING
THE NEWS THIS WEEK AND FRANKLY,

19:01.241 --> 19:04.177
IT WAS DEPRESSING.
I FEEL LIKE EVERY DAY THERE'S

19:04.177 --> 19:07.013
ANOTHER STORY OF A BILLIONAIRE
BEING HORRIBLE.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.215
IT FEELS LIKE NOTHING EVER
CHANGES AND THERE'S NOTHING WE

19:09.215 --> 19:11.618
CAN DO ABOUT IT.
YEP, I AGREE.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.920
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE ALMOST
UNTOUCHABLE.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.691
I WISH WE COULD DO SOMETHING.
WELL, WE COULD ROAST THEM.

19:17.691 --> 19:20.827
ROAST THEM?
YOU MEAN LIKE WE CAN INSULT THEM

19:20.827 --> 19:24.464
AS IF WE WERE TEENAGERS IN A
HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA, THROWING

19:24.464 --> 19:31.371
INACCURATE AND BASELESS INSULTS
IN THEM ROOTED MOSTLY IN LOOKS

19:31.371 --> 19:32.906
AND BASED ON ZERO FACTS?
YES.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.841
AND WILL IT MAKE US FEEL
BETTER?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.109
I THINK SO.
LET'S TRY IT.

19:36.109 --> 19:40.246
OKAY.
SO, LIKE, LOOK AT AMAZON FOUNDER

19:40.246 --> 19:47.821

20:09.843 --> 20:13.346

SOMETHING INSIDE ME THAT I DO

NOT KNOW IF I CAN PUT BACK.

22:06.426 --> 22:08.862
WE ARE PRETTY DEEP INTO
NOVEMBER AND LIVING IN NEW YORK

22:08.862 --> 22:11.731
THIS TIME OF YEAR ALWAYS MAKES
ME FEEL THE SAME WAY.

YOU LOOK OUTSIDE AND YOU SEE
EVERYONE GETTING READY FOR THE

22:15.335 --> 22:17.637
HOLIDAY SEASON.
YOU WATCH THE LEAVES CHANGE

22:17.637 --> 22:22.075
COLOR AND GRAB A HOT COCOA.
YOU GET HOME FROM A LONG DAY'S
