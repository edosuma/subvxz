WEBVTT

00:03.170 --> 00:05.548
"Hit your numbers,
hit your numbers."

00:05.548 --> 00:07.466
Some politician's pressuring the chief

00:07.466 --> 00:10.803
who's pressuring us
to make more arrests.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.722
To hit our numbers.

00:12.722 --> 00:14.223
What are we, salesmen?

00:15.057 --> 00:17.309
Look, you wanna make detective,
you got to play the game.

00:17.309 --> 00:21.147
And our job is to clean up
this neighborhood.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.651
Genius?

00:25.651 --> 00:27.111
More like I'm Queen Bee, bitch.

00:29.822 --> 00:32.158
There he is. Romero Delgado.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.543
Ready?

00:55.973 --> 00:56.932
Showtime.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.192
License and registration?

01:06.192 --> 01:07.568
Yes, sir.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.237
What did I do?

01:11.363 --> 01:13.491
I'm a cook. I need to get to work.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.870
I smell marijuana.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.288
How about you, Billy?

01:20.414 --> 01:21.791
I smell it too.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.835
- Open up your trunk, Mr. Delgado.
- I don't do drugs.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.796
We could wait for a warrant.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.924
It'll probably take a couple hours.
It's up to you.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.345
Thanks.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.855
Put your hands on your head
and get out of the car.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.357
- I didn't do anything!
- Now!

01:47.274 --> 01:49.860
- Please, I have to get to work.
- Put your hands on your head.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.112
I can't--
I can't lose my job. Please.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.239
I don't know why you're doing this.

01:53.239 --> 01:56.283
I don't know why you--that's not mine.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.535
- Let's go. Come on.
- I've never seen that before.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.203
- Come on. Let's go.
- Officers, that's not mine!

01:59.203 --> 02:01.705
- Officer, please!
- You have the right to remain silent.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.249
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

02:03.249 --> 02:06.168
- It's not mine!
- You have the right to an attorney...

02:28.023 --> 02:29.108
 Renee.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.737
Hey, Renee, you're making a huge mistake.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.281
Make it fast, Harry.

02:35.281 --> 02:36.699
I'm late for an arraignment.

02:36.699 --> 02:38.284
Romero Delgado.

02:38.284 --> 02:41.579
He's a line cook with no criminal record
and he's no drug dealer.

02:41.579 --> 02:44.498
- Good morning, Sam.
- His brother ran with the Latin Kings.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.667
Oh, so it's guilt by association now?

02:46.667 --> 02:49.211
The guy had meth and a ghost gun
in his trunk.

02:49.211 --> 02:51.171
So says two vice cops
who pulled him over for no reason.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.923
That doesn't raise any red flags for you?

02:52.923 --> 02:54.258
 Okay.

02:54.258 --> 02:56.886
And why would they frame
this solid citizen of yours?

02:56.886 --> 02:59.013
Real estate developers
are bankrolling politicians

02:59.013 --> 03:00.973
to put pressure on cops to make busts,

03:00.973 --> 03:03.976
all to pave the way for new condos
moving in to Mid-City and you know it.

03:03.976 --> 03:07.313
All I know is the case I have
in front of me and it is rock solid.

03:07.313 --> 03:09.648
- Renee...
- I've known you for a long time, Harry.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.526
Do your client a favor. Take a plea.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.778
He's not my client.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.156
I thought you two go way back.

03:17.156 --> 03:19.325
Well, it's a process.

03:19.325 --> 03:21.619
Romero will lose his job
and then his house.

03:21.619 --> 03:23.537
- I know. I know, I know.
- I mean, that's what they want.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.582
Those cops made four busts like this
in the last six months,

03:26.582 --> 03:29.752
law-abiding homeowners in Mid-City
with drugs in their car.

03:29.752 --> 03:31.545
They cannot just get away with this.

03:31.545 --> 03:32.963
They won't. I promise.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.216
Harry, since we met last year
and took down those traffickers,

03:36.216 --> 03:37.718
you changed my life.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.554
You're the one that convinced me
to do this

03:40.554 --> 03:43.182
to get off the partner track
and fight for the little guys,

03:43.182 --> 03:47.353
so I just--I need you
to give it to me straight.

03:47.353 --> 03:49.563
Do you think I can win this in court?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.649
Absolutely.

03:51.649 --> 03:54.193
No way on Earth
she wins this case in court.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.195
Would you run it, please?

03:56.195 --> 03:58.280
Yes. Meet vice cops

03:58.280 --> 04:00.282
Kira Simone and Billy McShane.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.409
Lots of commendations
and no record of misconduct.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.786
It's 'cause they're covering
their tracks.

04:03.786 --> 04:05.913
If it's their word against Romero's,
he's guilty.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.331
No jury is gonna question them.

04:07.331 --> 04:10.250
So if you were representing this guy,
what advice would you give him?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.962
I'd advise him to take the plea.
The risk of going to trial is too great.

04:12.962 --> 04:15.798
Which is exactly why the other folks
these cops framed

04:15.798 --> 04:18.467
didn't even try to fight back.
I mean, they just did their time.

04:18.467 --> 04:19.718
We have to stop them.

04:20.719 --> 04:21.595
Well, that settles it.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.680
I'm thinking...

04:22.680 --> 04:23.764
- Bear Trap.
- Tennessee Toothache.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.308
- Cottonmouth Wiggle.
- If I may.

04:26.308 --> 04:27.726
Breanna got to run a job this year

04:27.726 --> 04:29.436
and I have a plan
that I would like us to try.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.896
- Whoa, I mean, we-we-we...
- Kinda gotta ease in...

04:30.896 --> 04:32.523
- We love you, Harry.
- ...to something like that, man.

04:32.523 --> 04:34.149
Maybe take a stint
with one of the overseas groups.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.110
- Hey, you know what? Hurley.
- Hurley.

04:36.110 --> 04:39.238
I acknowledge it's a lot to ask,
but I did make Sarah a promise.

04:41.073 --> 04:45.285
No. We've all jumped in at some point.
It's Harry's turn.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.455
What's your play, our Mr. Wilson?

04:48.455 --> 04:51.125
There's a preliminary hearing coming up
in Romero's case.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.961
If we can prove in open court
that these cops are dirty,

04:53.961 --> 04:55.337
their credibility will be shot.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.548
The DA will be forced to drop the charges.

04:57.548 --> 04:58.465
So?

04:58.465 --> 05:03.554
So... let's go steal a major drug bust?

05:05.180 --> 05:07.766
- It's not how--it's not a question.
- Uh...

05:07.766 --> 05:08.976
Bring it down.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.270
I liked it. Just needs a little practice.

05:11.270 --> 05:12.312
Nice try, Harry.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.204
Can you--can you please stop that?

05:30.164 --> 05:31.915
Looks like they paid off their CI.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.126
Finally.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.879
10:02 AM, subject buys two coffees
and a glazed donut.

05:36.879 --> 05:41.050
10:17 AM, subject one sits in car
and does crossword puzzle in pen.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.092
Surveillance blows.

05:42.092 --> 05:45.054
All right. Can you put that away?
We're going.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.683
Welcome to the shop, baby.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.478
Hey, my partner and I,
we just wanna have a little talk with you.

05:52.478 --> 05:53.854
Okay. What you wanna talk--

05:53.854 --> 05:55.564
- Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
- I don't know.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.317
Why don't you tell me,
Robert Guthrie, Jr.?

05:59.568 --> 06:01.487
I know I got friends
in NOLA PD, right?

06:01.487 --> 06:03.739
Oh, good for you. We're the feds.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.032
And you're on our radar.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.409
Looks like you're
one punch away from a free smoothie.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.703
- Hey.
- It might be your last for a while.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.580
I don't think you understand.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.416
I'm on your side.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.709
- Are you?
- I'm with the police.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.170
- Oh.
- Okay. Let me try to explain it to you.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.589
There's two buses
leaving the station, okay?

06:20.589 --> 06:23.926
There's the witness bus
and then there's the defendant bus.

06:23.926 --> 06:27.221
Now, Bobby,
which one of those do you wanna be on?

06:28.514 --> 06:29.556
Take my card,

06:29.556 --> 06:32.434
you think about it, you give us a call.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.729
I'm keeping this.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.650
But... I want my free smoothie.

06:40.442 --> 06:43.112
Okay. So if hassling the informant
was the bait,

06:43.112 --> 06:45.322
how do we know our dirty cops
will bite the hook?

06:45.322 --> 06:48.158
Well, Harry thinks so
and he was a dirty lawyer, so.

06:48.158 --> 06:51.662
Plus, we gave their informant a card
with our fake task force address on it.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.707
- Oh.
- Hey, hey.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.378
- Who is it?
- NOLA PD.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.549
Well, come in.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.176
We come in peace.
I'm Kira Simone. This is Billy McShane.

07:06.176 --> 07:10.139
Wow, it looks like you got yourself
a real federal task force here.

07:10.139 --> 07:13.517
- Yeah. I'm Nick O'Brien, FBI.
- Hmm.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.436
This is Deputy US Marshal Kate Mercer.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.981
This is Grillo, Cyber Unit, Treasury.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.566
What brings you to the Big Easy?

07:20.566 --> 07:22.067
An investigation.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.485
And we're very busy.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.697
Oh, no worries.
We can catch you another time.

07:26.697 --> 07:27.698
We work Vice.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.324
I just think there could be
some synergy here.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.035
Hmm. No. We have everything we need.
Thank you.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.913
No? Oh, okay.
Well, you wanna know what I see?

07:35.789 --> 07:39.376
I see, uh, Three Blind Mice.

07:39.376 --> 07:42.045
You have nobody that knows the streets,
knows the players.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.673
I mean, this is NOLA, not DC.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.092
And you've already scared
half the town hassling my CI.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.720
You wanna go home empty-handed?

07:50.512 --> 07:52.472
Yeah. You need us.

07:52.973 --> 07:56.518
And it benefits us to know
what the feds are doing in our town.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.606
Welcome to Operation Fer-de-Lance.

08:00.606 --> 08:01.690
All right.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.444
This is our target, Graziela Ortega.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.030
A ruthless narco
who just arrived from Bogota.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.407
Intel says she's meeting
with a pretty shady lawyer,

08:10.407 --> 08:13.785
a one Harry Wilson,
to negotiate a shipment.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.371
Grillo's got eyes and ears
in Wilson's office right now.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.998
Yo, yo, yo!

08:17.998 --> 08:20.417
We got Graziela. She's here.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.211
And we are recording.

08:22.211 --> 08:24.755
<i>...you brought your heavies here.</i>

08:24.755 --> 08:26.798
Well, it looks like it's your lucky day.
You're just in time.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.133
Turn it up. Turn it up.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.761
<i>Look, now, Ms. Ortega,
I appreciate you wanting to meet with me,</i>

08:30.761 --> 08:32.971
<i>but I don't think that I can help you.</i>

08:33.847 --> 08:36.600
<i>Your client has supply chain issues.</i>

08:36.600 --> 08:37.851
<i>I can help.</i>

08:37.851 --> 08:40.979
<i>Yes, but being a middleman
is not a role that I'm comfortable with.</i>

08:40.979 --> 08:42.105
<i>What are you afraid of?</i>

08:42.105 --> 08:43.857
<i>I'm afraid of ended up
like Warren Sarsfield.</i>

08:43.857 --> 08:46.610
<i>His wife was getting mailed pieces of him
every year on his birthday.</i>

08:46.610 --> 08:49.488
<i>Senor Sarsfield disappointed me.</i>

08:50.405 --> 08:52.324
<i>I leave for Bogota tomorrow.</i>

08:52.324 --> 08:55.869
<i>Meet me at Pier 47 at 9:00 AM,</i>

08:55.869 --> 08:58.455
<i>terms as we discussed.</i>

08:58.455 --> 09:02.292
<i>If this doesn't happen,
I will be very sad.</i>

09:05.629 --> 09:06.922
<i>Senor Wilson.</i>

09:10.676 --> 09:12.469
All right, people, let's get to work.

09:21.812 --> 09:25.148
As soon as Sophie and I make the deal,
you guys bust in and arrest us.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.483
And as you're hauling us away,

09:26.483 --> 09:28.443
you make sure to leave the dirty cops
in the warehouse

09:28.443 --> 09:30.362
where they can bag and tag the cash
and the drugs.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.531
Well, dirty cops will do
what dirty cops do.

09:32.531 --> 09:33.824
They will help themselves.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.617
And we get the whole thing on video.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.911
Where did you find those henchmen
at such short notice?

09:37.911 --> 09:40.789
Ah, they're from Leverage International,
did us a solid.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.958
We catch them with their hands
in the cookie jar,

09:42.958 --> 09:45.419
- and Romero goes free.
- Not just him.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.380
Once the prosecutor sees this videotape,
he's gonna throw out all their busts.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.467
Hey, Sarah, what's up?

09:54.469 --> 09:58.098
Uh, all right. Make sure they keep him
in the clinic overnight.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.059
What happened?

10:01.059 --> 10:02.561
Romero got attacked.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.730
It seems the guards showed up
just in time.

10:04.730 --> 10:05.647
Attacked why?

10:05.647 --> 10:08.066
Romero's brother was a shot caller
with the Latin Kings

10:08.066 --> 10:10.652
and apparently he ran afoul
of a prison gang a couple years ago.

10:10.652 --> 10:13.405
The green light covers the entire family.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.573
This is not the end of it.

10:14.573 --> 10:18.618
Which is why we have
to break him out of jail right now.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.964
You think Harry knew about the gang beef
with Romero's brother?

10:30.964 --> 10:33.258
- Kind of a big thing to miss.
- Yeah, well, at some point,

10:33.258 --> 10:34.509
you gotta take the wheel.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.803
Well, this isn’t it.
Look, he's earned our respect,

10:36.803 --> 10:38.221
now he needs our support.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.432
Okay, plan B.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.268
- Purple Rhino?
- No.

10:45.520 --> 10:47.522
Romero is scheduled to appear
in open court tomorrow

10:47.522 --> 10:48.732
for his preliminary hearing.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.816
Where Sarah was gonna expose

10:49.816 --> 10:51.526
our dirty cops
are stealing drug bust money.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.905
Exactly. Now it's the location
where we're gonna snatch Romero.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.615
Ooh, a kidnapping. Uh, the good kind.

10:56.615 --> 10:58.742
Courthouse is a soft target. Smart.

10:59.993 --> 11:00.994
What about the corruption twins?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.288
They're still on the task force.
We can still get them in the long con

11:03.288 --> 11:05.415
after we make sure Romero's okay.
He's the priority.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.501
Agreed. So first things first,

11:07.501 --> 11:10.837
Eliot, be a sweetheart, dust off an alias,
get yourself arrested.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.255
Breanna, bring some heat.

11:20.472 --> 11:24.017
Burning eyes not okay.

11:26.812 --> 11:29.815
Say no to hot sauce cancer cluster.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.528
Make your voice heard!

11:36.321 --> 11:39.408
Come on, do it, bots!

11:41.243 --> 11:44.287
No hot sauce, no hot sauce,

11:44.287 --> 11:49.000
no hot sauce, no hot sauce, no hot sauce,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.546
no hot sauce, no hot sauce.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.262
No hot sauce, no hot sauce,
no hot sauce...

12:00.262 --> 12:01.847
Status please, Harry.

12:01.847 --> 12:04.057
Yep. I'm coming in hot.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.184
Hey, morning, Sam.
Hold that for me a second.

12:06.184 --> 12:09.688
No hot sauce, no hot sauce...

12:09.688 --> 12:11.690
Sorry. What were you saying?

12:15.944 --> 12:18.572
I've got eyes on Romero.
They're taking him to holding.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.656
Sarah.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.326
Do you think the judge will release Romero
after the jail attack?

12:23.326 --> 12:26.204
Oh, well, he denied bail
after bogus gun and drug charges,

12:26.204 --> 12:27.122
so what does that tell you?

12:27.122 --> 12:28.373
What am I gonna do?

12:28.373 --> 12:30.959
You're gonna fight for your client.
That's, that's your job.

12:30.959 --> 12:33.128
You let me worry about his safety.

12:33.128 --> 12:36.798
I should know by now not to ask questions
I don't want answers to,

12:36.798 --> 12:39.843
so I'm just gonna say... thank you.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.930
Don't thank me yet.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.599
Eliot, how we doing?

12:48.602 --> 12:50.103
Package acquired.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.897
Breanna, are we ready for our launch?

12:56.026 --> 12:57.027
Venti is armed.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.620
I'm saying I just, I feel like
I've got a weird feeling about this.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.413
I mean, what if the judge doesn't bite?

13:08.413 --> 13:10.707
- This guy's a citizen.
- Relax.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.960
- This trial is never going to court.
- How do you know?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.296
A deputy at the jail told me
there was a green light on our boy Romero.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.506
They didn't get him yesterday,

13:17.506 --> 13:19.132
but only a matter of time before they do.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.967
Look, I know we're supposed
to clean up this neighborhood,

13:20.967 --> 13:22.636
but what did this guy do exactly?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.804
His brother is a gangbanger.
He's not an angel.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.139
Everybody's guilty of something.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.435
We didn't exactly do this by the book.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.938
I did it by the book for years
and got nowhere, okay?

13:32.938 --> 13:34.773
And then I had old an partner
who showed me the way.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.525
You make your arrest,
you get the job done.

13:36.525 --> 13:38.944
If you don't like it,
then go coach Pop Warner football.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.237
Hey.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.657
My client has never broken the law
in his life...

13:43.657 --> 13:45.617
...and now he's been attacked.

13:46.201 --> 13:47.619
He's the victim here.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.496
Save it for the judge, Ms. Nichols.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.458
Is that... sriracha?

13:55.835 --> 13:59.297
It must be the protesters outside
pulling some kind of stunt.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.217
Well, just don't stand there. Help me.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.094
You're gonna make a great mom someday.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.679
She's a maniac!

14:11.351 --> 14:12.519
Hey, what's happening?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.603
- What's going on over there?
- Hey, what's happening, man?

14:13.603 --> 14:14.646
- I don't know.
- Hey, Officer.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.481
- I don't know, man.
- What--what's happening?

14:16.481 --> 14:18.483
- Hey! What's happening?
- I'll take it from here.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.651
Where are you going?

14:27.993 --> 14:29.494
- God, I want hot wings.
- What's happening?

14:29.494 --> 14:30.954
We're busting you out.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.124
- Put those on.
- Trust us.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.293
Yeah. I'm a firefighter.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.586
Dammit.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.173
- No hot sauce! No hot sauce!
- All right, Romero, follow us.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.009
Follow us. We'll clear the path.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.141
Hey. Okay. Okay. Here we go.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.143
He's falling behind.
There's something wrong.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.648
Keep going. You're almost there.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.650
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.488
Where do you think you're going?

15:07.032 --> 15:08.742
<i>Oh. No. Please.</i>

15:11.828 --> 15:13.580
The limp give you away. Get up.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.001
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

15:18.001 --> 15:19.836
Should have plead guilty.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.714
Could've helped you in there,
not anymore.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.386
Uh, Eliot and Parker
can take these two cops, right?

15:28.386 --> 15:29.346
Um...

15:30.096 --> 15:32.057
Harry, it's your call.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.562
And then what?
We get into a high-speed chase

15:37.562 --> 15:39.064
in a bright red food truck?

15:40.231 --> 15:41.149
<i>Abort.</i>

15:41.149 --> 15:42.150
<i>Copy that.</i>

15:42.150 --> 15:46.154
I'm gonna go back in the holding cell,
maybe I can protect him from inside.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.213
Why didn't I think about the limp?

16:03.213 --> 16:04.964
I could have Breanna distract the cops.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.967
I could have had Romero
brought out on a stretcher.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.679
Here's how I see it.

16:10.679 --> 16:13.848
Simone may be corrupt,
but she's also a good detective.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.058
Both can be true.

16:15.058 --> 16:17.686
First, the brother, now this.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.147
Your plan A and plan B are a bust.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.149
What's your M?

16:23.149 --> 16:24.484
I have no idea.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.698
Are you a good lawyer?

16:30.407 --> 16:31.658
My clients thought so.

16:33.284 --> 16:37.414
So what, what would you do
after a bad day at court, give up?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.917
No, go back to the office
and hit the books.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.877
That's what I thought.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.880
I have something to show you.

16:50.593 --> 16:54.764
This trunk belonged to Victor Lustig.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.433
Do you know who that is?

16:56.433 --> 16:58.351
The man who tried to sell
the Eiffel tower?

16:58.351 --> 17:01.938
Yes. He's one of the greatest grifters
who ever lived.

17:01.938 --> 17:04.232
It was a gift from my mentor.

17:05.275 --> 17:09.571
It was a complicated relationship,
but he did give me this.

17:10.071 --> 17:11.656
It's my library.

17:11.656 --> 17:15.994
It's a collection of some of the greatest
grifts and heists of all time.

17:15.994 --> 17:18.288
Your plan M is in there.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.666
Get to work, Mr. Wilson.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.846
Ooh! It looks like
he hasn't slept all night.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.891
- Hmm. Maybe we should, uh, take the...
- Mm-mm.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.976
New plan.

17:40.477 --> 17:41.770
We are not gonna snatch Romero.

17:41.770 --> 17:42.896
- We're not?
- We don't have to.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.522
'Cause the dirty cops
are gonna do it for us.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.192
Ooh, you're gonna run
the Turkish Prisoner, excellent choice.

17:48.777 --> 17:52.280
Wait, I'm sorry. Do you have
some sort of grifter library

17:52.280 --> 17:53.615
written in hieroglyphs?

17:53.615 --> 17:56.826
Oh, that's from the tomb of Nakht.
It means beware of crocodiles.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.621
And, uh, what is the Turkish Prisoner?

17:59.621 --> 18:01.748
You can probably tell the story
better than I can.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.082
It's the height of World War I

18:03.082 --> 18:06.836
and the British troops are being pummeled
by the Turkish army

18:06.836 --> 18:07.962
and forced to surrender.

18:07.962 --> 18:11.007
So then they're marched
to a remote prison camp.

18:11.007 --> 18:13.718
Think, hmm, well, the Alcatraz of its day.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.553
Escape means certain death.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.347
But two British officers,

18:17.347 --> 18:19.682
Jones and Hill, they're very clever

18:19.682 --> 18:22.602
and they didn't bother with digging
a tunnel or scaling a wall, no.

18:22.602 --> 18:27.190
They weave a story of ghosts
and mesmerism

18:27.190 --> 18:31.319
all leading to a horde of hidden gold.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.696
And with that story,
they convinced the commandant

18:33.696 --> 18:36.991
- to march them out the door to freedom.
- Except we don't need ghosts

18:36.991 --> 18:39.244
and I have the best treasure story,

18:39.244 --> 18:43.039
-"The Legend of the Lost Stash House."
- I know that one.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.249
Parker told me about it.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.294
Okay. Right.
So there was this bagman, right?

18:48.294 --> 18:51.381
And he hid $10 million in cash

18:51.381 --> 18:53.925
inside the walls of a house
right here in New Orleans.

18:53.925 --> 18:56.553
He was holding it for this,
like, big narco guy,

18:56.553 --> 18:58.805
but the bagman didn't trust anybody.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.932
So when he got killed in a drive-by,

19:00.932 --> 19:03.476
the location of the stash house
died with him.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.354
People have been searching for it
ever since, if it even exists.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.106
I had a client
that swore that it did.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.942
And he died before he could find it,
which is how I know

19:10.942 --> 19:11.985
it's gonna hook our dirty cops.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.737
The problem is, they know us from the con.
We're blown.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.239
That's the best part.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.952
Okay. We've got a task force
chasing a narco

19:20.952 --> 19:22.579
who's in town on mysterious business.

19:22.579 --> 19:25.748
We've got a fed in jail
and we've got a treasure.

19:25.748 --> 19:27.500
We have everything we need.

19:31.212 --> 19:34.257
Hey, check this out.
It's from Harry's client,

19:34.257 --> 19:36.009
the one who was searching
for the stash house.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.845
It's got interviews, it's got maps,

19:38.845 --> 19:41.306
and the dude was hardcore
about an urban legend.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.391
Oh, no, it's real. No.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.768
It's not like the <i>Candyman</i>
or <i>The Horse Whisperer.</i>

19:45.768 --> 19:48.771
I mean, also, can you imagine
being woke up in the middle of night

19:48.771 --> 19:50.106
by a horse whispering in your ears?

19:53.568 --> 19:57.697
Oh, well, you know,
the cops just show up when you want.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.115
Sorry, we had to make a stop at the jail.

19:59.115 --> 20:02.201
A deputy told me that Nick
picked a fight with the locals.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.828
Yeah. Uh...

20:04.704 --> 20:07.373
He just snapped, you know.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.125
You're in the dark just as much as we are.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.962
FBI agent trying to keep a low profile
just snaps?

20:12.962 --> 20:14.005
What's going on?

20:16.049 --> 20:18.343
You know what?
I'll just call your bosses in DC.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.427
We'll just ask them. All good.

20:19.427 --> 20:23.306
No, no, he, uh, he was looking
for the lost stash house, okay?

20:23.306 --> 20:25.058
I mean, we all are.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.769
The 10 million urban legend?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.608
What does that have to do with Nick?

20:33.608 --> 20:34.984
He's protecting Romero Delgado.

20:34.984 --> 20:38.154
- Why him?
- Because he can lead us to it.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.238
To the money.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.573
The bagman left him a clue.

20:40.573 --> 20:44.869
And honestly, you all are responsible,
like when you arrested Delgado,

20:44.869 --> 20:46.371
you put him on Graziela's radar.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.456
That 10 million, it's her money.

20:48.456 --> 20:51.167
- And she's here to collect it.
- Unless, of course,

20:51.167 --> 20:54.545
we find it first,
and then we all get to retire early.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.881
Hold on. I'm sorry. Operation Free to...

20:56.881 --> 20:58.549
- Fer-de-Lance.
- Shut up.

20:58.549 --> 21:02.595
Fer-de-Lance is just a ruse
to get Graziela to lead you to the money?

21:02.595 --> 21:05.598
That's right.
And there's enough for all of us, so.

21:05.598 --> 21:06.724
Do we have an understanding?

21:08.935 --> 21:11.980
All right, show me this clue.

21:12.563 --> 21:13.564
Ow!

21:17.193 --> 21:18.653
It's nine names.

21:18.653 --> 21:20.196
Who are they?

21:20.196 --> 21:21.572
They're all dead.

21:26.202 --> 21:29.414
Obviously there's not
a whole lot on the web about these folks.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.833
Yeah. The only thing connecting them
is that they're here.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.877
Yeah. And right next to each other.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.171
- In three rows of three.
- Huh.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.257
Here. Hold that.

21:39.841 --> 21:42.927
Hey, maybe the stash house is a lie.

21:42.927 --> 21:44.095
What if the money's here?

21:44.095 --> 21:45.263
I don't know.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.973
Ten million dollars in small bills,

21:46.973 --> 21:48.516
that takes up a lot of space.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.226
No. It's another clue.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.227
Yeah, but where?

21:51.227 --> 21:52.729
I mean, we don't even know where to look.

21:52.729 --> 21:55.648
Chevaux, Xavier, Osborne.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.525
Some are Xs and some are Os.

21:58.109 --> 21:59.402
Tic-tac-toe.

22:06.409 --> 22:07.535
Here.

22:08.870 --> 22:09.954
Something's buried here.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.417
Come on.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.794
Oh, I don't wanna hear anything
about your bad knee.

22:16.794 --> 22:17.712
Dig.

22:18.796 --> 22:19.922
Let's go, let's go.

22:19.922 --> 22:23.801
Figures. Always gotta do
the grunt work around here.

22:23.801 --> 22:24.802
Faster.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.263
Who's that?

22:27.263 --> 22:28.890
Don't know.
We'll get rid of them. Stay here.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.892
Keep digging. Go, go.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.602
Come on. Dig.

22:34.437 --> 22:35.980
Come on. Faster.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.190
What is it?

22:40.151 --> 22:41.319
What the...

22:41.319 --> 22:43.071
Hey, hey. We're federal agents.

22:43.071 --> 22:45.198
No, no, no, no.
That's not what's happening.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.283
Hurry up.

22:49.869 --> 22:51.370
- What is that? What's going on?
- Quiet.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.248
That's not what I see.
I see opportunists.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.792
Common thieves.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.710
Now, where is my money?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.088
I don't know, but we can help you find it.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.298
We're not greedy.
Just give us a finder's fee.

23:02.298 --> 23:05.176
I give everyone I do business
with two choices,

23:05.176 --> 23:08.387
plata or plomo, silver or lead.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.808
Now, if you had come to me
and offered your assistance,

23:11.808 --> 23:13.434
I would have agreed to your proposal.

23:13.434 --> 23:16.187
In fact, I would have been very generous.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.022
But you didn't do that. No.

23:18.022 --> 23:21.734
Instead, you went behind my back
and tried to steal from me.

23:21.734 --> 23:24.654
So you made your choice.

23:26.739 --> 23:27.990
Wait, stop! No, please!

23:30.201 --> 23:32.161
Now, clean this up.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.830
Leave no trace.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.041
They're hooked.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.670
What do you think? I tried a new recipe.

23:40.670 --> 23:42.505
Oh, hmm.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.133
Nutella?

23:47.051 --> 23:48.886
<i>You better hope they took the bait.</i>

23:48.886 --> 23:50.346
What is it, Eliot?

23:51.013 --> 23:53.891
I just got a kite passed through the bars.

23:53.891 --> 23:56.853
They greenlit another hit
on Romero in the morning.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.947
They're gonna keep coming
because of my brother.

24:08.990 --> 24:11.033
Yeah. We're gonna get you
out of here today.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.577
I'm gonna protect you.

24:12.577 --> 24:13.661
What if I plead guilty?

24:13.661 --> 24:15.580
It's my first offense.
The judge would let me free.

24:15.580 --> 24:18.833
Yeah. There's forces here
that are bigger than you and I, all right?

24:18.833 --> 24:20.001
They want your house,

24:20.001 --> 24:23.087
and they are not gonna stop
until they get it.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.798
These guys are like gangs in prison,

24:25.798 --> 24:27.800
except they wear $5,000 suits.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.927
Now, I want you to trust me.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.722
And I need you to follow my lead, okay?

24:32.722 --> 24:34.223
Huh! Huh!

24:36.601 --> 24:38.895
Get out of--hey. Fellas, forget it.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.062
We got the wrong guy.

24:40.062 --> 24:41.397
Romero's not even this guy's brother.

24:41.397 --> 24:43.316
He's not even part of the Latin Kings.
He's a--what did you say?

24:43.316 --> 24:45.401
A line cook in a restaurant.

24:45.401 --> 24:48.404
However, that is some hard work, though.
It's a respectable job.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.322
Now get out of here, man.

24:55.745 --> 24:58.497
Aw, look who went
to arts and crafts today.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.917
Nice work on that,
uh, a razor mount there,

25:00.917 --> 25:02.919
but that's just gonna piss me off.

25:02.919 --> 25:06.088
However, took a lot of time
on that spoon, good job.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.758
And you've got a pen.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.596
All right.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.917
All right. Break it up.

25:42.917 --> 25:43.918
Break it up.

25:48.256 --> 25:49.257
Hey!

25:49.882 --> 25:50.800
Leave him alone.

25:56.389 --> 25:57.974
Need to see you at the task force, Nick.

25:57.974 --> 25:59.850
Let's go have a little chat.

26:01.769 --> 26:04.480
Back in 1915,
it took Jones and Hill months

26:04.480 --> 26:08.192
of, I don't know, seances
and trances to get to this point.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.402
I'm impressed.

26:09.402 --> 26:10.569
If she bites.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.904
- You're worried?
- Yeah, I'm worried.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.782
She's a dirty cop,
but like you said, she's a good detective.

26:14.782 --> 26:16.784
Ambition and greed
aren't her only weaknesses.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.160
She's also a problem solver.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.578
That's a weakness?

26:19.578 --> 26:21.122
All talents become vices

26:21.122 --> 26:23.332
- when you add one small ingredient.
- What's that?

26:23.332 --> 26:26.085
Success.
You gave her a tantalizing problem.

26:26.711 --> 26:28.212
A key without a lock.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.216
Absolutely not.

26:32.216 --> 26:33.676
I've been looking
for this stash house for years.

26:33.676 --> 26:35.011
I'm not cutting you guys in.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.345
All your friends are dead, Nick.

26:37.763 --> 26:38.806
What are you talking about?

26:38.806 --> 26:40.057
Graziela.

26:40.057 --> 26:41.225
We got there too late.

26:43.185 --> 26:44.979
You're lying. Both of you.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.565
You don't kill two feds
without ended up all over the news.

26:47.565 --> 26:49.108
You know how the narcos do it.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.526
No body, no crime.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.653
Your friends are never gonna be found.

26:52.653 --> 26:53.738
And you're next.

26:53.738 --> 26:56.198
Which means that we're your best hope
for getting outta here.

26:58.659 --> 27:00.661
Tell me which door this key opens.

27:01.954 --> 27:02.872
All right.

27:03.664 --> 27:04.498
But not here.

27:04.999 --> 27:08.044
You gotta walk us both out, me and Romero.

27:08.044 --> 27:11.088
Sure. Yeah. As soon as you tell me
where the stash house is.

27:11.088 --> 27:13.382
I don't know what that key opens,
all right?

27:13.382 --> 27:15.051
You know who does? Romero.

27:15.051 --> 27:16.761
And he just got a green light put on him,

27:16.761 --> 27:19.013
and he's sitting in there in general pop.

27:19.013 --> 27:22.475
So if you want your money,
it's right now or never.

27:25.019 --> 27:27.480
We'll get you outta here
before the attacks get worse.

27:29.732 --> 27:31.650
We got you out on a 24-hour pass.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.153
You try anything,
we shot you trying to escape.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.489
I already wrote up the paperwork
for the report.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.033
Now, what does this key open?

27:39.033 --> 27:41.494
I don't know,
but I recognize the key chain.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.829
- It's from Gator Jill's.
- What the hell is that?

27:43.829 --> 27:46.707
An alligator park, destroyed by Katrina.

27:46.707 --> 27:49.794
Me and my friend, we used to work there
before he went to work for the narcos.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.545
Alligator park?

27:51.545 --> 27:52.713
You buying this?

27:54.090 --> 27:56.384
"Welcome to the carnivorous reptile
capital of the world,

27:56.384 --> 27:59.637
home to the 14-foot monsters
that call the swamp our home."

27:59.637 --> 28:01.097
Looks like it was a real place.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.306
Come on.

28:03.391 --> 28:04.767
Was a real place.

28:04.767 --> 28:05.768
What's there now?

28:05.768 --> 28:08.062
I don't know, people left...

28:08.729 --> 28:10.398
I bet the gators stayed.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.078
What was that?

28:24.078 --> 28:26.497
An alligator, you moron.

28:26.497 --> 28:28.999
- They're everywhere.
- Just relax.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.459
Simone, I don't know if I can do this.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.545
Yes, you can do it. Calm down.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.422
Get your head in the game, okay?

28:34.422 --> 28:35.798
- Okay.
- Fine.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.890
This way. Follow me.

28:45.766 --> 28:46.684
Come on, McShane.

28:46.684 --> 28:48.269
Get out. Tie up the boat.

28:49.353 --> 28:50.312
What?

28:50.312 --> 28:51.981
Come on, man, we're in the red zone.

28:52.565 --> 28:56.110
There aren't alligators in football.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.031
All right, let's get this baby open.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.078
It's clear.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.290
Clear.

29:10.875 --> 29:11.876
Yeah.

29:12.960 --> 29:13.878
Okay.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.091
What the hell are you doing?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.217
I'm looking for the money.

29:20.217 --> 29:23.137
There's not $10 million dollars
in a cash register, you moron.

29:23.137 --> 29:26.390
I told you to stop calling me that.
You know, I've had a lot of concussions.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.767
- What are we looking for?
- We're looking for a clue!

29:28.767 --> 29:30.436
- God!
- You guys.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.563
Romero's buddy's
not just gonna hand him a map.

29:32.563 --> 29:33.814
Somebody could steal it.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.107
He's not stupid.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.275
He's gonna make you work for it.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.319
Then what's the clue?

29:41.322 --> 29:42.698
She's not finding it.

29:42.698 --> 29:43.824
Should Eliot step in?

29:44.325 --> 29:45.493
Let's be patient.

29:45.493 --> 29:47.161
We've left nothing to chance.

29:47.161 --> 29:48.078
How?

29:48.871 --> 29:52.041
By capturing her attention
without her even knowing it.

29:52.041 --> 29:55.586
<i>First, a flash of color,
but not too stark.</i>

29:55.586 --> 29:57.421
<i>Then a face.</i>

29:57.421 --> 30:00.382
Humans evolved to track eyes,
even in an image.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.802
The alligator keychain. It's blue.

30:08.224 --> 30:09.308
Oh, my God.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.768
Guys.

30:12.102 --> 30:14.146
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

30:17.816 --> 30:18.734
Here we go. Here we go.

30:18.734 --> 30:21.987
Um, its numbers.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.073
- Yes. Numbers.
- What does it--what does it mean?

30:25.449 --> 30:28.661
Looks like coordinates to, uh, an address.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.165
It's gotta be the stash house.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.751
All right, we find the money
and we divvy it up.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.711
You guys drop the charges on Romero.

30:37.711 --> 30:39.505
Yeah. That's our deal.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.966
Dammit, man. What?

30:41.966 --> 30:45.010
I swear.
I met you before on a drug investigation.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.470
- But you had a different name.
- What?

30:46.470 --> 30:48.097
Never met you in my life, man.

30:48.097 --> 30:49.348
I go undercover a lot.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.183
People, people, we have an address.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.810
Okay. Let's get rich.

30:52.810 --> 30:53.894
Go.

30:57.690 --> 31:00.359
But first, we got a few loose ends
we got to tie up.

31:02.903 --> 31:04.697
Come on. Now!

31:14.873 --> 31:16.292
Where's the boat?

31:17.543 --> 31:20.379
What do you mean, where's the boat?
Boat's in the middle of the water.

31:22.172 --> 31:23.841
I told you to tie up the boat.

31:23.841 --> 31:25.009
I did.

31:25.009 --> 31:27.928
You two go get the boat.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.680
- Go get the boat?
- Now!

31:35.019 --> 31:36.520
I don't know if I can do this.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.689
Homestretch. Keep your head about you.

31:47.489 --> 31:52.620
Romero! No! Romero! Run! Run!

31:52.620 --> 31:53.829
Nick!

31:53.829 --> 31:55.873
Help, help!

32:01.128 --> 32:02.921
I told you! He's taking the bullets!
Look at him!

32:04.506 --> 32:06.216
- I'm out.
- Me too.

32:07.593 --> 32:08.427
Is that a...

32:08.427 --> 32:09.845
What do we do?

32:09.845 --> 32:12.139
Run!

32:16.143 --> 32:18.646
Shh. Shh.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.692
I heard those gunshots.

32:30.366 --> 32:32.910
Whatever happened
in that swamp out there,

32:32.910 --> 32:35.162
I'm gonna make you pay for it.

32:35.162 --> 32:38.791
- Oh, God.
- Now, tell me where my money is

32:38.791 --> 32:42.127
or I'm gonna send you home in pieces.

32:42.127 --> 32:43.671
On three. One...

32:45.381 --> 32:46.465
- Should we call for backup?
- And tell them what?

32:46.465 --> 32:47.800
We're not supposed to be here.

32:47.800 --> 32:48.801
Two.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.844
- What about the others?
- They're gator food.

32:50.844 --> 32:52.221
Do you wanna go swimming with them?

32:52.221 --> 32:53.389
Where is my money?

32:53.389 --> 32:54.932
We have what we need. Let's just go.

32:54.932 --> 32:56.558
Three.

32:59.228 --> 33:00.229
- She's so scary.
- Oh, my God.

33:00.229 --> 33:03.023
Let's get the money!
Go, go, go, go!

33:08.696 --> 33:10.739
Eliot. You can come out now.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.491
Sold it. I believed it.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.576
What are you doing?
What are you--keep it together, man.

33:14.576 --> 33:15.703
I'm trying.

33:26.755 --> 33:28.841
Well, how was that for a death scene?

33:28.841 --> 33:30.175
You were great.

33:30.175 --> 33:33.762
I always knew that you were
a method actor over Meisner. Ugh.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.848
Who the hell is Meisner?

33:35.848 --> 33:37.474
Hey. You guys were amazing.

33:37.474 --> 33:40.144
Thank you so much.
Oh, and Parker said give her a call

33:40.144 --> 33:42.020
about that job in Honduras.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.858
Oh, Mr. Wilson, I've seen
the Turkish Prisoner done three times,

33:45.858 --> 33:48.152
but never with an alligator.

33:48.152 --> 33:49.570
<i>Two alligators, actually.</i>

33:55.743 --> 33:56.618
I don't understand.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.537
Where did the cops go?

33:58.537 --> 34:02.374
They went to find the money
in the walls of the house.

34:04.835 --> 34:06.211
What house?

34:13.635 --> 34:15.220
What if Graziela is coming?

34:15.220 --> 34:17.765
Don't be greedy.
Just take what you can carry.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.185
Where could you be?

34:21.935 --> 34:23.103
This doesn't feel right.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.858
Where are you?
Where are you, piles of money?

34:28.942 --> 34:30.819
I'm about to be rich.

34:30.819 --> 34:33.363
Seriously, this is off.
I don't like it.

34:35.657 --> 34:36.909
Could it be in the wall?

34:42.998 --> 34:44.875
Help me.

34:44.875 --> 34:47.127
McShane, help.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.504
Help me.

34:48.504 --> 34:49.963
Oh, baby.

34:49.963 --> 34:52.341
McShane, McShane.

34:52.341 --> 34:55.552
McShane.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.721
McShane, what are you doing?

35:02.851 --> 35:04.019
Oh, no.

35:06.104 --> 35:07.773
Don't move, you suckers.

35:10.567 --> 35:13.153
Your Honor,
it's plain as day what's going on here.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.363
Enlighten me.

35:14.363 --> 35:17.407
Those cops wanted to frame my client
because they thought he knew

35:17.407 --> 35:19.117
the location of hidden drug money,

35:19.117 --> 35:21.036
and they wanted him under their thumb.

35:21.036 --> 35:22.871
You're talking about the urban legend.

35:23.372 --> 35:25.958
Here's a photograph of them
leading Delgado out of jail

35:25.958 --> 35:27.835
after they've arrested him twice.

35:27.835 --> 35:31.588
And why exactly did they search
for at Ms. Fontenot's house?

35:31.588 --> 35:32.756
You'll have to ask them.

35:32.756 --> 35:34.758
I have the same question, Judge.

35:34.758 --> 35:38.428
In the meantime, I will be dropping
all charges against Mr. Delgado.

35:38.428 --> 35:39.847
Well, I'll sign the order.

35:39.847 --> 35:42.766
And the four other people busted
for drugs by these two cops,

35:42.766 --> 35:44.977
you'll reopen their cases as well?

35:44.977 --> 35:46.895
- Of course.
- Far be it from me

35:46.895 --> 35:48.230
to tell you how to do your job,

35:48.230 --> 35:51.525
but I think if you just leaned
on one of those cops a little bit,

35:51.525 --> 35:53.735
maybe that Billy McShane,
he might tell you all about

35:53.735 --> 35:57.447
those arrest quotas and the shady
real estate developers behind them.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.325
Our grand jury investigation

36:00.325 --> 36:02.160
will be wide-ranging and thorough,
Your Honor.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.830
See that it is, Ms. Fontenot.

36:04.830 --> 36:05.998
I'll make sure of it.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.129
- Don't. Just don't.
- Next round of golf's on me, Renee.

36:12.796 --> 36:13.922
Nice work, Counselor.

36:15.007 --> 36:17.968
Harry, how did those cops
end up at her house?

36:17.968 --> 36:20.220
Oh, it's a long story.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.347
- I've got time.
- Well, it's 1915,

36:22.347 --> 36:24.391
and the world is consumed by war.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.435
Dawn breaks over the Tigris River.

36:26.435 --> 36:30.147
Okay, so we got this place
at a foreclosure auction.

36:30.147 --> 36:31.940
It's yours now.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.317
But I have a house.

36:33.317 --> 36:35.193
Eh, consider it an investment property.

36:35.193 --> 36:38.196
Besides, your neighbors are gonna need
some help fighting developers.

36:44.077 --> 36:46.747
Oh, you're gonna wanna use this.

36:46.747 --> 36:50.334
I think the place needs some... renovations.

36:51.418 --> 36:55.464
Okay. Ten million dollars in cash takes up
about 30 cubic feet of space.

36:55.464 --> 36:58.717
When you factor in floor plans,
building permits issued since 2005

36:58.717 --> 37:01.553
and renovated homes and the bagman's
last known whereabouts,

37:01.553 --> 37:05.641
the formula gives you...
315 Oak View Drive.

37:05.641 --> 37:08.518
Sold.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.151
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

37:16.151 --> 37:19.738
Oh, it's true! Oh, my God!

37:19.738 --> 37:21.615
I'm rich!

37:21.615 --> 37:23.075
Whoo!

37:26.286 --> 37:27.579
Good news.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.456
McShane already rolled on his partner.

37:29.456 --> 37:32.793
Oh. The dominoes are starting to fall.

37:32.793 --> 37:34.002
Cheers.

37:35.170 --> 37:39.007
Hey, uh, how come you gave me
so much rope on this one,

37:39.007 --> 37:42.177
even when all my plans failed
so spectacularly?

37:42.177 --> 37:44.680
What is a con?

37:45.639 --> 37:46.682
Is that a trick question?

37:46.682 --> 37:49.601
It's a set of artificial circumstances

37:49.601 --> 37:52.646
designed to elicit an intended response.

37:52.646 --> 37:54.356
<i>A Christmas Carol</i> , that's a con.

37:54.356 --> 37:56.441
<i>Cyrano de Bergerac.</i>

37:56.942 --> 37:59.778
Once you start seeing it like that,

37:59.778 --> 38:03.949
like a blank canvas, you realize
everyone's gonna paint it differently.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.410
I guess that's why
we're called con artists.

38:06.410 --> 38:07.744
Yeah.

38:08.245 --> 38:11.206
You know, Parker and Eliot,
they have crews all over the world,

38:11.206 --> 38:13.250
and they're run by a neuroscientist,

38:13.250 --> 38:15.794
a professor of philosophy, a clockmaker.

38:16.503 --> 38:17.713
You're a lawyer.

38:17.713 --> 38:21.008
That is the lens
through which you see the world.

38:21.008 --> 38:23.927
And I knew if I gave you
just a little nudge,

38:23.927 --> 38:27.055
you'd use the law to get the job done.

38:27.055 --> 38:29.391
I don't feel much like a lawyer lately.

38:29.391 --> 38:31.018
I'm not sure really what I am.

38:31.852 --> 38:35.605
Harry, you light up
when you're in a courtroom

38:35.605 --> 38:39.526
or when you're mentoring a young attorney.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.028
It's your calling.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.113
You think I'll go back?

38:43.655 --> 38:44.781
Someday.

38:46.867 --> 38:50.078
With a very distinctive set of skills.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.040
Maybe not criminal law, but...

38:53.540 --> 38:57.169
Hmm... a law criminal?

38:58.045 --> 39:01.173
Harry Wilson, law criminal.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.132
I like that.

39:45.926 --> 39:48.428
Eliot, Billy the Gent.
He's an old friend.

39:48.428 --> 39:49.513
It's about my daughter.

39:50.514 --> 39:52.140
You remember Miranda.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.683
Is she in some kind of trouble?

39:55.060 --> 39:57.437
You are family, forever.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.689
She's fallen under the spell
of a scam team.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.108
- Multilevel marketing?
- It's a pyramid scheme.

40:01.108 --> 40:02.359
Like a pyramid?

40:02.359 --> 40:03.902
I never thought about it that way.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.029
A stranger is just a...

40:06.029 --> 40:08.657
...Magiq Baby seller you haven't met yet.

40:08.657 --> 40:11.618
Suck them dry
and move on to new victims.

40:11.618 --> 40:14.287
Without me, they are nothing.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.498
Gonna have to step up our game.

40:16.498 --> 40:17.749
- Yes!
- No!

40:23.839 --> 40:25.799
I hope you fight better than you lie.

40:25.799 --> 40:27.676
Fortunately, I've had
good teachers in both.
