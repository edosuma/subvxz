00:03.871 --> 00:08.242
[theme music]

00:49.683 --> 00:53.053
[laughter]

00:56.457 --> 00:59.227
No, I ordered
chicken, not salmon.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.962
Who the hell eats salmon
at a wedding, anyway?

01:02.062 --> 01:05.299
Well, I'll tell who.
Not us, that's who.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.067
Now I got 60 people coming.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.169
Whoa!

01:08.269 --> 01:09.370
65.

01:09.470 --> 01:11.339
My cousin Trudy and her
family can come after all.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.243
OK.

01:15.343 --> 01:18.846
So it's chicken for 65 people.

01:18.946 --> 01:19.980
Well, it's no big deal.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.016
You just add another Bucket

01:23.117 --> 01:25.085
Roseanne, thank
you for handling

01:25.186 --> 01:26.387
these wedding preparations.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.122
I told you a thousand
times, Crystal.

01:28.222 --> 01:30.258
I'm happy to do it.

01:30.358 --> 01:33.227
Where were we?

01:33.327 --> 01:35.529
What is going on?

01:35.629 --> 01:37.097
Grandpa wanted to
race us from the car.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.166
Yeah.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.733
He bet us each a buck
that he could win.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.307
Well, are we just going
to let him lie there?

01:46.407 --> 01:47.675
Oh!
Oh my god!

01:47.775 --> 01:49.009
Ed!

01:49.109 --> 01:50.378
Are you OK?

01:50.478 --> 01:51.379
Yeah.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.482
It's nothing a
plastic hip won't fix.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.550
Now Ed, you ought to be
saving some of that energy

01:56.650 --> 01:57.885
for your honeymoon.

01:57.985 --> 02:01.722
Oh, that's good advice, honey.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.923
Hey, hey, mom.

02:03.023 --> 02:04.225
Check out all the cool
stuff that Grandpa got us.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.793
Yeah, look.
I got a bracelet.

02:05.893 --> 02:06.694
And look at this.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.928
Yeah, that's a chemistry set.

02:08.028 --> 02:09.430
Every boy should have one.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.898
Oh, you shouldn't
have done that, Ed.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.301
We could just turn on the
gas and blow ourselves up.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.870
- It's perfectly harmless.
- We'll see.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.742
Lonnie, why don't you
show them what I got you?

02:21.842 --> 02:22.643
Oh.

02:22.743 --> 02:23.811
A Walkman.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.112
That's wonderful, honey.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.814
You've been wanting one of
those for the longest time.

02:26.914 --> 02:27.715
Yeah.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.016
Now I have one.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.851
I tried to get him
one of those little TVs,

02:30.951 --> 02:31.985
but he wouldn't take it.

02:32.085 --> 02:32.886
Yeah, Lonnie.

02:32.986 --> 02:33.821
You got to get into this.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.055
Right.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.258
You've got a guy here trying
to buy your affections.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.158
Let him.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.729
Aren't they just the
sweetest little things?

02:43.063 --> 02:44.332
Well, now listen.

02:44.432 --> 02:47.568
I admit that I'm kind of a softy
when it comes to grandkids.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.303
But Lonnie is
going to be my son.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.704
And you've got to be
tough with your boys,

02:50.804 --> 02:53.607
ain't that right, Lonnie roo?

02:53.707 --> 02:54.675
So.

02:54.775 --> 02:58.246
You girls Pick up your
bridesmaids gowns?

02:58.346 --> 03:00.748
Yeah, we got them yesterday.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.716
You know, we're really
honored you asked us.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.519
But we'd understand
if you'd rather

03:05.619 --> 03:07.688
honor your adult friends.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.423
Well, don't be silly.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.058
Why would you
think such a thing?

03:11.158 --> 03:12.426
Because those
gowns are so dorky

03:12.526 --> 03:13.527
they make us want to retch.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.268
They're very nice.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.969
They're just not us.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.437
Yeah.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.173
They're more for people
who get an allowance.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.977
Hey Bec, let's
go try those on.

03:30.077 --> 03:30.878
Yeah.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.450
Women Huh?

03:36.550 --> 03:38.118
Aye, oh.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.853
Ha, ha.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.690
I bet you got a lot of
questions about women.

03:42.790 --> 03:43.591
I guess.

03:43.691 --> 03:44.892
Can we go now, Mom?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.727
Well, now honey,
Roseanne and I aren't

03:46.827 --> 03:47.928
down with the seating plan.

03:48.028 --> 03:48.829
Oh, that's fine, Crystal.

03:48.929 --> 03:49.997
I can finish it.

03:50.097 --> 03:51.599
But you don't know
half the people.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.800
Well, that will
make it go faster.

03:55.803 --> 03:56.670
Please?

03:56.770 --> 03:57.971
Take the boy home, Crissie.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.307
I mean, you can do
that stuff later.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.442
Well, if you both think so.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.510
You see there, Lonnie?

04:02.610 --> 04:03.777
I'm in there pitching for you.

04:03.877 --> 04:04.778
Right.
Thanks.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.679
Bye.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.717
He'll be all right.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.352
I'll see you both later.

04:11.452 --> 04:15.589
[smooch]

04:15.689 --> 04:16.924
Lonnie's a great kid.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.192
We're going to have a wonderful
relationship as soon as we

04:19.293 --> 04:20.127
get over this little hurdle.

04:20.227 --> 04:21.362
What?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.864
The one where he thinks
you're the beast from hell?

04:23.964 --> 04:24.765
-

04:24.865 --> 04:25.833
That's the one.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.034
Oh, he'll come around, Ed.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.235
Sure he will.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.338
I mean, he and Crissi been
alone for a long time.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.072
And now there's this new guy.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.474
I just gotta try harder.

04:33.574 --> 04:34.442
That's all.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.544
Well, I don't think
that's possible.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.478
Want some coffee?

04:37.578 --> 04:38.379
No, thanks.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.847
I got to pick up my tux.

04:39.947 --> 04:40.814
Hey, Danny boy!

04:40.914 --> 04:42.883
Hey.

04:42.983 --> 04:43.851
Don't worry about it Ed.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.653
He's not talking to me either.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.721
Why does he hate me so much?

04:47.821 --> 04:48.889
I wasn't such a bad father.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.224
Put a roof over his head,
kept his belly full.

04:51.325 --> 04:52.125
Way full.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.197
Between him and Lonnie, I
feel like I've got two boys who

04:57.297 --> 04:58.966
won't give me the time of day.

04:59.066 --> 05:02.503
Well, maybe you'd do
better with daughters, Ed.

05:02.603 --> 05:05.839
I got a couple of them I'll
let you have for a nice price.

05:05.939 --> 05:06.774
What you asking?

05:06.874 --> 05:07.675
Oh, cool!

05:07.775 --> 05:10.711
I thought I had to pay you.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.012
Where you going?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.381
Your car's out in the front.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.248
Uh, just-- you
know, walk around.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.217
It's cold out there.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.586
Even colder in there.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.298
Good morning, star shine.

05:31.399 --> 05:35.268
Don't you think you should
like, lighten up, Dan?

05:35.369 --> 05:37.705
You betrayed me, Roseanne.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.107
Now don't you think
that's just a tad harsh?

05:40.207 --> 05:43.343
I mean, you know, I'm ordering
cocktail weenies for 60.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.079
I'm not turning you
over to the Nazis.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.548
You know I'm opposed
to this wedding.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.717
Yes, you've made
that quite clear.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.619
And you're ordering the
food, the flowers, and the band

05:51.719 --> 05:52.986
like what I say means nothing.

05:53.086 --> 05:56.390
And the wedding's going to
go, Dan, no matter who plans it.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.891
And Crystal's my best friend.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.560
I'm your husband, Roseanne.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.728
I outrank her.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.763
You're supposed to back me up.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.299
Remember, richer or poorer, in
sickness, health, death part?

06:09.169 --> 06:11.071
Well, I never took
any vow to back you up

06:11.171 --> 06:12.906
when you're acting stupid.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.341
It's not stupid.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.410
This wedding is a
joke, and you know it.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.812
No, I do not know that.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.081
Crystal's happy, and
your dad is happy.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.950
And that's what
weddings are about.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.052
Fine Have a good time.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.019
You've got to go, Dan.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.320
You're the best man.

06:27.421 --> 06:30.057
Besides, your whole family
is going to be there.

06:30.157 --> 06:33.494
Your Aunt Mildred is going to
get up and dance with the band.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.796
And Uncle Pete's going to
pull a quarter out of his nose

06:35.896 --> 06:37.898
like he always does.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.934
You're not leaving me
alone with those people.

06:41.034 --> 06:41.835
Forget it.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.403
You're on your own.

06:43.504 --> 06:44.337
There's going to be cake.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.846
[music playing]

06:57.350 --> 07:00.654
[exclamations]

07:00.754 --> 07:02.623
You slut.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.458
Oh, I could never wear this.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.726
What'll Ed think?

07:05.826 --> 07:07.528
Well, there won't
be enough blood left

07:07.628 --> 07:08.796
in his brain to think anything.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.036
He's a pig.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.438
All men are pigs.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.974
Jackie, you're just
saying that because you

07:21.074 --> 07:22.476
don't have a date for
the wedding tomorrow,

07:22.576 --> 07:24.945
and everyone else does.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.881
What's your point, Crystal?

07:27.981 --> 07:31.218
Simply that you don't
have to be so bitter.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.185
I'm not bitter.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.086
Oh, no.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.421
Of course not.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.590
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have to use the ladies' room.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.159
Gee, that's like the
eighth time, Crystal.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.261
We oughta move the whole
shindig in the john.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.997
No, Roseanne.

07:44.097 --> 07:48.135
I am not bitter.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.102
Give it a rest, Jackie.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.470
I'm not.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.106
I am looking forward to spending
time with Becky and Darlene

07:53.206 --> 07:54.007
tomorrow.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.576
[doorbell]

07:55.676 --> 07:56.877
Becky and Darlene have dates.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.649
Darlene?

08:01.749 --> 08:04.317
Darlene has a date?

08:04.417 --> 08:06.620
Now I'm bitter.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.521
Annemarie!

08:07.621 --> 08:08.455
Hey!

08:08.556 --> 08:09.356
You made it!

08:09.456 --> 08:10.624
Are you kidding?

08:10.724 --> 08:12.593
You know your parties were
legends when we were kids.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.562
Well, I got more
boring friends now.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.664
So don't keep your hopes up.

08:16.764 --> 08:17.631
Annemarie!

08:17.731 --> 08:18.532
Hey!

08:18.632 --> 08:19.933
Crystal!

08:20.033 --> 08:20.834
Congratulations!

08:20.934 --> 08:22.269
Oh, thank you!

08:22.369 --> 08:24.838
You know, I'm so glad
Roseanne ran into you.

08:24.938 --> 08:25.939
How has it been?

08:26.039 --> 08:27.240
I haven't seen you
since high school.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.609
What you been up to?

08:28.709 --> 08:31.712
Well, after graduation,
there was this party

08:31.812 --> 08:33.981
at Sarah Foster's house
where I met Rusty,

08:34.081 --> 08:35.849
who was to be my
first husband, but not

08:35.949 --> 08:37.651
until July of that year.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.286
But by August, the
spark had flickered.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.287
Uh huh.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.022
So we split up.
And I married Travis.

08:42.122 --> 08:45.158
Oh, and well, that Travis, he
was a whole other can of worms.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.426
He was an arc welder.

08:46.526 --> 08:49.797
And when we divorced he actually
cut the trailer in half.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.231
But you know, we remain friends.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.265
Do something.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.466
And I never thought
love would come--

08:53.567 --> 08:54.835
Oh, I know what let's do!

08:54.935 --> 08:56.236
I know what let's do.

08:56.336 --> 08:57.838
Let's play Who
Knows Crystal Best.

08:57.938 --> 08:58.739
Oh.

08:58.839 --> 08:59.640
OK.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.008
I'll say the first question.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.075
OK.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.410
Um-- all right.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.980
What was Crystal's
nickname in high school?

09:07.080 --> 09:07.948
Oh, too easy.

09:08.048 --> 09:08.849
Right.

09:08.949 --> 09:09.750
That was it.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.525
That's not true.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.492
I got one.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.527
I know.

09:20.628 --> 09:21.895
I got one.

09:21.995 --> 09:25.398
What was playing on Gilbert
Coswell's car radio the night

09:25.498 --> 09:28.769
Crystal did it for
the first time?

09:28.869 --> 09:29.670
Jackie!

09:29.770 --> 09:30.904
Jackie!

09:31.004 --> 09:32.973
That was told to you in the
strictest of confidence!

09:33.073 --> 09:34.041
Hey!

09:34.141 --> 09:35.676
You got a man in your
life, and I don't.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.178
So throw me a bone.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.079
OK.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.148
Any guesses?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.583
You don't mean that
Rusty wasn't her first?

09:43.684 --> 09:44.451
[squeals]

09:44.551 --> 09:45.352
Yes, he was!

09:45.452 --> 09:46.687
Yes, he was!

09:46.787 --> 09:48.622
This game isn't fun anymore.

09:48.722 --> 09:50.223
OK.
Was it

09:50.323 --> 09:51.224
Stairway to Heaven"?

09:51.324 --> 09:52.259
No.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.994
How about "Crystal
Blue Persuasion"?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.028
No, no, no.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.697
How about "My Sweet Lord"?

09:56.797 --> 09:59.066
Well, that wasn't
coming from the car radio.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.571
I know what it was!

10:04.672 --> 10:05.472
[shrieks]

10:05.572 --> 10:06.473
Roseanne, don't you dare!

10:06.573 --> 10:07.540
Don't you dare!

10:07.641 --> 10:10.644

does the hanky panky.

10:10.744 --> 10:14.347
[in unison] My baby
does the hanky panky.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.317
My baby does the hanky panky!

10:17.417 --> 10:18.385
OK!

10:18.485 --> 10:19.720
Thank you!

10:19.820 --> 10:21.755
Thank you for sharing my secrets
with the whole wide world,

10:21.855 --> 10:26.093
Roseanne and Jackie
blabbermouth!

10:26.193 --> 10:27.560
Uh oh.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.797
Well, I'll be back.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.832
We're just killing time till
the stripper gets here, right?

10:35.769 --> 10:37.771
Oh, Crystal.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.172
We were just kidding around.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.073
We're sorry.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.508
Yeah, We're sorry.

10:41.608 --> 10:42.710
OK?
- OK.

10:42.810 --> 10:43.610
All right.

10:43.711 --> 10:44.978
Now let's go back in there.

10:45.078 --> 10:48.148
Ah, just a moment.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.482
What's the matter, Crystal?

10:49.582 --> 10:52.019
I'm just not in the mood
for a party right now.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.687
Something wrong?

10:53.787 --> 10:55.889
I'd rather not say.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.057
Oh, come on, Crysta.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.325
You can trust us.

11:02.429 --> 11:04.698
With the big stuff.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.600
Well, I suppose I
have to tell someone.

11:07.701 --> 11:10.771
Roseanne, Jackie, I'm pregnant.

11:10.871 --> 11:13.640
[spitting]

11:13.741 --> 11:16.543
[choking]

11:19.046 --> 11:21.448
Are you sure
you're not just late?

11:21.548 --> 11:22.950
No, I don't think so.

11:23.050 --> 11:24.051
I got all the signs.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.686
I been nauseous and
been eating like crazy.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.856
And well, my doctor
said I'm pregnant.

11:32.025 --> 11:36.730
Well, so are we happy or sad?

11:36.830 --> 11:37.664
Well, happy!

11:37.765 --> 11:38.565
Oh!

11:38.665 --> 11:39.532
I think it's great!

11:39.632 --> 11:41.468
We're happy for you, Crystal!

11:41.568 --> 11:42.369
Geez.

11:42.469 --> 11:45.138
Oh wow.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.173
Does Ed know?

11:46.273 --> 11:47.074
Of course.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.241
Oh, what do you want?

11:48.341 --> 11:49.442
A boy or a girl?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.079
Well, I've always dreamed
of having a little girl.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.747
What if it's a boy?

11:53.847 --> 11:56.116
Simple operation.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.484
Oh, Roseanne.

12:00.453 --> 12:01.955
I can't find my bowling ball.

12:02.055 --> 12:02.856
Do you know where it is?

12:07.027 --> 12:10.197
Yes, it's in the bedroom
closet where it always is.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.869
Oh Roseanne.
I'm so sorry.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.037
You two are hardly talking.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.471
And it's all my fault.

12:18.571 --> 12:22.242
Yeah, that's pretty
much the way I see it too.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.812
Well, maybe if I tell
him about the baby,

12:24.912 --> 12:27.380
he won't be so upset
about the wedding.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.515
I don't think so.

12:28.615 --> 12:30.050
Well, well, maybe it'll help.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.751
Hey, Dan--
- No, I don't think you--

12:31.852 --> 12:32.552
Dan, wait.
Listen.

12:32.652 --> 12:33.686
--should do this, Crystal.

12:33.787 --> 12:36.123
Your father and
I, we've been--

12:36.223 --> 12:39.359
well, we were going to tell--

12:39.459 --> 12:40.227
She's pregnant.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.339
I told you not to tell him.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.126
Come on in.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.596
Just throwing myself a
little bachelor party here.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.065
Usually the best
man makes the party.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.667
But you know, you do
with what you got.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.669
[music on tv]

13:22.769 --> 13:24.371
What are you doing?

13:24.471 --> 13:26.406
What's You look like?

13:26.506 --> 13:28.308
I'm nursing this beer.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.343
And I'm watching a
dirty movie through all

13:30.443 --> 13:31.578
those little squiggly lines.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.749
Why don't you just
pay the 4 bucks, Dad?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.852
They'll unscramble it for you.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.787
Then they'll know I'm in
here watching a dirty movie.

13:43.991 --> 13:44.858
Grab yourself a beer.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.259
You're going to need it.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.760
In about two
minutes you're going

13:47.861 --> 13:48.728
to have a hell of a headache.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.167
So.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.069
To what do I owe
this great honor?

13:59.139 --> 14:01.241
Dad, I know
Crystal's pregnant.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.076
Oh.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.146
[chuckle] She wasn't
supposed to tell

14:06.246 --> 14:07.380
anybody till after the wedding.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.848
Is that why you're
doing this, because you

14:08.949 --> 14:11.318
think you have to get married?

14:11.418 --> 14:13.486
No.

14:13.586 --> 14:14.387
Oh, that's gross.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.359
Danny, you're right.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.329
I have to get married
because Crystal

14:22.429 --> 14:25.865
is the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.634
What about the baby?

14:27.734 --> 14:28.535
He's fine with this.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.873
You're making a mistake, Dad.

What am I supposed to do?

14:35.308 --> 14:36.743
Cancel this wedding?

14:36.843 --> 14:39.446
Let Crystal raise a
kid all by herself?

14:39.546 --> 14:40.680
No.

14:40.780 --> 14:41.581
What are you telling me?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.418
Maybe you should wait.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.587
Wait for what?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.389
You've got no
business raising a kid.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.290
Why?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.926
You know Damn well why!

14:53.026 --> 14:55.028
I don't want to
watch it again, Dad.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.129
You're going to be on the road.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.466
The kid's going to grow
up just like I did--

14:59.566 --> 15:01.268
without a father.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.536
And I'm going to see
Crystal suffer just Mom did.

15:03.636 --> 15:04.271
OK.
I got it.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.272
I got it.
I got it.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.406
It's not about
Crystal and our baby.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.575
It's about you and me.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.277
How I screwed up your life.

15:10.377 --> 15:12.079
I mean, just look at you.
You've got a nice family.

15:12.179 --> 15:12.980
You've got a good marriage.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.081
You own your own business.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.915
I mean, how can you
ever forgive me, Dan?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.717
Tell me one damn thing
that you ever did for me that

15:17.817 --> 15:18.851
took time instead of money.

15:18.952 --> 15:19.752
So fine!

Dan, I'm tired of this!

15:29.462 --> 15:30.497
OK.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.333
I made mistakes with you
and with your mother.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.169
But I got a second chance now.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.538
I thought that you
would want to help.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.607
But you don't.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.443
So Crystal and I will just
do it all by ourselves.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.811
And something else!

I'm no going to apologize to
you anymore because you're never

15:47.447 --> 15:49.682
going to let me off the hook!

Now if you don't mind, you're
bringing my party down.

have to wear this crud.

16:41.068 --> 16:41.868
Jeez, Darlene.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.036
It's only a couple hours.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.304
You'll live through it.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.538
Yeah.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.375
But we can't duck the
photographer the whole time.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.409
There's a photographer?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.581
Hold on, DJ.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.648
It's not a race.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.573
Nice tux.

17:20.673 --> 17:21.474
Ready?

17:35.088 --> 17:35.988
Nice tux.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.190
Yeah.

compliments on it lately.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.782
I feel so bloated.

18:06.919 --> 18:11.324
Who could have foreseen
decades ago when a younger Ed

18:11.424 --> 18:14.561
met a 12-year-old
Crystal that years later,

18:14.661 --> 18:16.129
they would be
standing here ready

18:16.229 --> 18:19.699
to enter into holy matrimony?

18:19.799 --> 18:22.669
You didn't foresee that, right?

18:22.769 --> 18:23.603
Good.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.139
Then let's proceed.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.907
What is marriage?

18:28.007 --> 18:30.009
Fast forward.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.479
Do we have to watch
this sappy garbage?

18:32.579 --> 18:36.616
I thought it was a
beautiful ceremony.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.218
Well, can we please
just get to the good part?

18:44.591 --> 18:46.193
- Oh!
- Whoa!

18:46.293 --> 18:47.093
That's no good!

18:50.096 --> 18:53.500
You probably think you're better
than me cause you're married.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.901
Well, you're not
going to be married--

18:55.001 --> 18:55.902
Go forward!

18:57.970 --> 19:03.142
There's far more to
life than being married.

19:03.243 --> 19:09.716
Marriage is one more way
for men to enslave women.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.051
So get out of the cave, Crystal.

to call before you come over

21:08.568 --> 21:09.369
OK.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.872
I said it.

21:12.972 --> 21:13.906
Anyways.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.376
Uh, congratulations,
Crystal and Fred.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.276
What?

21:17.377 --> 21:18.845
No, his name's Fred.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.347
It's Fred.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.649
Are you sure?

21:22.749 --> 21:23.550
Anyways.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.353
Congratulations, Crystal and Ed.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.821
Embarrassed.

21:28.921 --> 21:32.291
Crystal, this is
dedicated to you.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.493
Here it comes.

21:33.593 --> 21:37.229
[singing in unison] My
baby does the hanky panky.

21:37.330 --> 21:41.200
My baby does the hanky panky.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.171
My baby does the hanky panky.

21:45.271 --> 21:49.141
[gasp]

21:49.241 --> 21:51.978
Are we just going
to let her lie there?
