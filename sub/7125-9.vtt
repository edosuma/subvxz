WEBVTT

00:06.458 --> 00:09.417
[Samantha] Flowers give
every woman a taste of amnesia.

00:10.959 --> 00:13.792
Why are those here?

00:13.792 --> 00:16.000
Who are they for?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.500
What do they mean?

00:17.500 --> 00:18.959
What does he want?

00:18.959 --> 00:21.000
What did I do?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
All good questions.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.709
And if you don't know life's
little codes... Well, you tend
to panic easily.

00:27.709 --> 00:32.000
Out of my way! Oh, God.
Is Samantha here yet?

00:32.000 --> 00:35.458
Hot! Crap, you're here.
Sorry I'm late.

00:35.458 --> 00:38.000
The coffee place
was out of Tanzania Peaberry.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
I drove across town, but all
they had was the light roast...

00:41.000 --> 00:42.917
Tracy, stop!

00:42.917 --> 00:45.041
You have to stop acting
like this, OK?

00:45.041 --> 00:48.041
- There is no reason
to be afraid of me.
- Sure there is.

00:48.041 --> 00:50.458
My bangs grew back
from the last time you cut them

00:50.458 --> 00:54.208
which, I agree, they were
annoying, despite what my
boyfriend said.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.583
- Ex-boyfriend.
- OK.

00:56.583 --> 01:01.041
Now, I know that I used to be
someone that you had to be
afraid of.

01:01.041 --> 01:04.041
As did the mailroom people.
And the homeless.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.333
Cats. Some clergy.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.917
My point is,
is that I've changed, OK?

01:08.917 --> 01:12.041
Let's try and forget about
this whole boss/assistant thing.

01:12.041 --> 01:16.458
- You're firing me?
- No. No, no, no.

01:16.458 --> 01:21.000
Just from now on let's just
be more like, you know,
like girlfriends.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.083
Does a girlfriend
hit harder than a boss?

01:24.083 --> 01:27.625
- Samantha Newly?
- Flowers?

01:27.625 --> 01:30.500
- Who sent...
- Baby's breath!
Sorry. Garbage flower.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.542
Tracy, stop!

01:32.542 --> 01:34.583
Come here.

01:35.542 --> 01:36.917
Give me a hug.

01:41.208 --> 01:45.917
[sobbing]

01:45.917 --> 01:48.875
[straining] You got to let go,
honey. OK. All right. Good.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.000
All right.

01:52.834 --> 01:54.166
Thank you.

01:55.500 --> 01:57.250
So who are those from?

01:57.250 --> 02:00.000
- Kevin.
- Oh, the lumberjack.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.500
The successful
floor contractor.

02:02.500 --> 02:07.166
Yeah, whatever.
So... how is he?

02:07.166 --> 02:11.041
Oh, he's fine, thanks.
He has a slight case
of the sniffles, though.

02:11.041 --> 02:13.041
No, in bed.

02:13.041 --> 02:16.875
I don't know. I've only known
him for two weeks.

02:16.875 --> 02:19.834
Oh, I see. He's gay.

02:19.834 --> 02:23.000
He is not gay.
Hey, listen to this.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.834
"Meet me at Club Eight
at nine.

02:25.834 --> 02:29.792
We'll dance until ten and
I'll have you in bed by eleven.

02:29.792 --> 02:33.041
When you go home
is up to you."

02:33.041 --> 02:36.208
Oh, my God. Tonight might
be the first time that I,

02:36.208 --> 02:39.333
you know, do it
since the accident.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.250
And it's with a gay lumberjack.
That's kind of sad.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.750
He is not gay.
He is respectful.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.500
Sweetie, my brother's
respectful.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.583
And he moved to Amsterdam
to marry his respectful friend,
Jay.

02:52.542 --> 02:54.792
I am so happy for you!

02:54.792 --> 02:58.000
If I were going to wish sex with
a handsome carpenter on anyone,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.208
you would be
my first choice.

03:00.208 --> 03:04.000
- Well, you'd be
my second choice.
- Oh!

03:04.000 --> 03:07.166
Look at your
beautiful flowers.

03:07.166 --> 03:10.166
Let's put them over here
so we can all enjoy them,

03:10.166 --> 03:12.500
and they can make
your father feel bad.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.000
They're from Kevin.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.125
[gasps] Oh, yey!

03:16.125 --> 03:20.583
And who's responsible for this
little courtship? Me. I am. Me.

03:20.583 --> 03:24.458
Yes, Mother. You set us up.
If it wasn't for you, I would
be nothing.

03:24.458 --> 03:27.000
Honey, don't be silly.
You wouldn't be nothing.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.166
You'd just be less.

03:29.166 --> 03:32.667
Maybe I can repay you by naming
our first child after you.

03:32.667 --> 03:35.291
Oh, yes, do!
Even if it's a boy.

03:35.291 --> 03:39.000
I think Regina is a masculine
name in some Latino cultures.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.834
I'm not in love with him.
It's just been three dates
and some flowers.

03:42.834 --> 03:44.875
I know, but don't put off
the wedding.

03:44.875 --> 03:49.000
Aunt Phoebe will not be happy
if she dies before seeing you
married.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.625
And I think those pig valves
only last about 13 years.

03:52.625 --> 03:57.000
Sam? If tonight is
your first night with Kevin,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.959
don't you think your carpet
should match your drapes?

03:59.959 --> 04:02.917
What? What does that mean?

04:02.917 --> 04:07.625
I think it means your bra should
match your panties, but I could
be wrong.

04:07.625 --> 04:10.583
Oh! OK.
Let's see what we got.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.458
Darn, these are all
still wet.

04:13.458 --> 04:17.083
I don't want to go all the way
to Todd's for underwear. Mom?

04:17.083 --> 04:20.041
Did you happen to put any of my
nice lingerie in my room today?

04:20.041 --> 04:23.458
No, but you could borrow
some of mine.

04:23.458 --> 04:26.792
I have a leopard-print set
that makes your father roar.

04:26.792 --> 04:30.625
I think they call
that jungle fever. No.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.333
And I'm off to Todd's.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.792
What you doing?

04:38.375 --> 04:42.000
All right, I wanted to spare
you, but I have a date with
Kevin tonight

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
and I would like it if my carpet
matched my drapes. OK?

04:46.000 --> 04:49.041
I don't think that phrase means
what you think it means.

04:49.041 --> 04:53.917
Whatever. What I'm trying
to say is that, you know,

04:53.917 --> 04:58.792
tonight might be the night that,
you know, Kevin and I get
intimate.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.750
I hope this isn't hard
for you.

05:01.750 --> 05:05.208
Not if it isn't hard for you,
you're holding my girlfriend's
panties.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.000
But they're in my drawer.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.500
Chloe's over a lot, I thought
it'd be easier if she had her
own drawer.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.792
Oh yeah. Right.
Yeah, of course it would.

05:14.792 --> 05:19.000
That's what people in
relationships do. They give
each other drawers. Doi.

05:20.125 --> 05:23.000
Yeah. It's tiny.
Good for her.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
- I'm sorry we had
to skip dessert.
- I am so, so sad.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.000
- How does this come off?
- Why?

05:36.458 --> 05:38.458
So I could take it off?

05:38.458 --> 05:42.709
Oh. Oh, yeah, right.
Naked. [chuckles]

05:42.709 --> 05:45.875
Oh, that makes sense. No, I mean
in order for me to get naked

05:45.875 --> 05:47.625
I've got to take
my clothes off.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
- Hey, I have an idea!
- What?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.083
Turn off the lights.

05:53.083 --> 05:54.291
Watch how fast.

06:18.417 --> 06:20.041
[whispering] Dena?

06:20.041 --> 06:23.208
Guess what? I'm in love!

06:35.875 --> 06:37.417
Good morning.

06:37.417 --> 06:42.041
Where have you been, young lady?
I have been worried sick.

06:42.041 --> 06:45.041
You've been to one of those
raves! You're high.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.834
It's called a smile, Mom.

06:47.834 --> 06:51.625
I was with Kevin.
And you were so right about him.

06:51.625 --> 06:54.291
- Thank you!
- Oh! Well...

06:54.291 --> 06:58.083
all the thanks I need is that
you admit I know what's best
for you.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.500
Well, gosh,
come on, sit down.

07:00.500 --> 07:04.166
I have some very exciting ideas
about your life.

07:04.166 --> 07:07.750
And I will even listen to them.
And you know why?

07:07.750 --> 07:09.917
Because I am in love!

07:09.917 --> 07:11.125
Oh...

07:11.125 --> 07:14.500
- You are not in love.
- Yes, I am. I know what I feel.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.041
No, you don't.
This is all brand-new for you.

07:17.041 --> 07:20.583
- It's the first time
you had sex.
- [Elevator dings]

07:20.583 --> 07:23.166
Old you would have already
changed your phone number,

07:23.166 --> 07:25.041
and met two new guys
on the way to work.

07:25.041 --> 07:28.959
La, la, la. I'm not listening.
I love Kevin and you can't stop
me.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.333
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.041
It is just biology!

07:32.041 --> 07:35.667
You have sex, your face gets
flushed, you feel all warm
and wonderful.

07:35.667 --> 07:38.625
It seems like love, but
it's nature's way of telling you

07:38.625 --> 07:41.000
to stick your panties
in your purse and run.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.792
- Did you hand
your secretary coffee?
- Uh-huh.

07:43.792 --> 07:47.875
Sammy, I'm going to sneak out
a little early. The boots I
wanted just went on sale.

07:47.875 --> 07:50.041
Oh, yeah.
Sure, Trace. Have fun.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.542
OK, don't take this
the wrong way,

07:54.542 --> 07:57.125
but parts of this new Sam
make me really hate you.

07:57.125 --> 08:02.041
Did you know there's a website
where you can send somebody
a little bear?

08:02.041 --> 08:05.500
- I'm going to vomit.
- I'm going to send you one.

08:08.041 --> 08:11.125
[drawers opening, closing]

08:16.792 --> 08:20.625
- Morning.
- Morning, you.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.542
- What are you doing?
- Did you know

08:23.542 --> 08:26.792
that you had a drawer
that only had socks in it?

08:26.792 --> 08:29.083
Yeah, I did.
I call that my sock drawer.

08:29.083 --> 08:32.375
I was thinking that if you put
your socks from that drawer

08:32.375 --> 08:34.291
into your underwear drawer

08:34.291 --> 08:38.750
then there would be this empty
drawer where I could put some
of my things.

08:38.750 --> 08:43.375
- You want a drawer?
- Yeah. I mean only
if it's OK with you.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.041
Yeah. Yeah. I guess
I just hadn't thought of it.

08:46.041 --> 08:48.959
Oh, well, it's a good thing
I thought of it for you.

08:48.959 --> 08:52.166
That's why we make
such a good team.

08:52.166 --> 08:55.709
I'll see you in the kitchen.
I'm going to go pick out
a coffee mug!

09:09.542 --> 09:11.041
OK, so now what?

09:11.041 --> 09:14.625
Hey there.
You snuck up again.

09:14.625 --> 09:16.041
You should wear a bell.

09:16.041 --> 09:19.041
Oh, is this it?
Are you getting your things out?

09:19.041 --> 09:20.417
Some.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.125
Kevin gave me a drawer.

09:22.125 --> 09:23.250
Of what?

09:24.083 --> 09:26.291
A drawer. For me.

09:26.291 --> 09:28.291
Oh.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.959
- Does he know that?
- Yes, Todd.

09:30.959 --> 09:33.041
I doubt this is
his first relationship.

09:33.041 --> 09:35.959
Yeah, but it is yours.
I'm saying this as a friend.

09:35.959 --> 09:38.250
Remember how we
decided to be friends?

09:38.250 --> 09:41.208
Yes, although I do think
that on some level

09:41.208 --> 09:44.959
we were just saying that
to keep from being hurt.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.083
- I wasn't.
- Neither was I.

09:48.291 --> 09:50.333
Don't you think
you're moving fast?

09:50.333 --> 09:52.166
No.

09:52.166 --> 09:54.250
- I mean,
it's only been two weeks.
- So?

09:54.250 --> 09:57.250
Life is not
a dress rehearsal, bucko.

09:57.250 --> 10:01.333
The curtain has gone up,
and I am not going to be late
to the show again.

10:04.375 --> 10:06.750
- Bucko?
- Yeah, you heard me.

10:08.959 --> 10:11.291
- You know it's got wheels.
- Whatever.

10:11.291 --> 10:15.166
[indistinct chatter]

10:15.166 --> 10:16.875
Sam?

10:17.875 --> 10:19.458
I like you.

10:19.458 --> 10:23.250
Oh, my God, I was just thinking
the same thing. How weird is
that?

10:23.250 --> 10:27.125
Maybe not so weird, two people
who like each other thinking
"I like you."

10:27.125 --> 10:30.959
If we were both thinking
"A polar bear can walk
30 miles in a day."

10:30.959 --> 10:33.709
That would be...
Sorry, you were saying?

10:33.709 --> 10:36.583
That maybe we should,

10:36.583 --> 10:39.458
you know, slow things down.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.291
Slow? How slow?

10:42.291 --> 10:44.125
I think we should...

10:44.125 --> 10:46.583
...stop seeing each other.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.709
Wow.

10:50.709 --> 10:53.000
That's very slow.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.834
[sobbing]

10:58.834 --> 11:01.166
Make it stop.

11:01.166 --> 11:04.500
Just teach me
how to be dead inside.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.417
Sweetie?

11:07.417 --> 11:09.667
- [snuffling]
- Oh...

11:09.667 --> 11:14.083
Crying makes me feel like
I should be comforting,
and I don't do comforting.

11:14.083 --> 11:16.792
Why did he break up
with me?

11:16.792 --> 11:19.917
Maybe it's because
I wasn't good in bed.

11:19.917 --> 11:21.542
Please.

11:21.542 --> 11:23.959
You can hit a guy in the head
with a book during sex

11:23.959 --> 11:25.792
and it's still going
to be good for him.

11:25.792 --> 11:30.333
I knew I guy who you had to hit
right in the head with a book

11:30.333 --> 11:32.208
before he could even...
Oh, my God.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.041
What is this?

11:34.041 --> 11:36.041
I'm making a card for Kevin.

11:36.041 --> 11:38.208
With pictures
of us together.

11:38.208 --> 11:41.208
I didn't have any pictures
of us, actually, together,

11:41.208 --> 11:45.041
but I had some of me and I cut
his head out of some of his
business cards.

11:45.041 --> 11:47.625
That's why his expression
is always the same.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.375
No. Stop. Just let him go.

11:50.375 --> 11:55.000
- Do not try and get him back.
- I'm not trying
to get him back.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.041
I just thought that, maybe,
he might want to see

11:58.041 --> 12:02.500
what we would look like together
on vacation in Paris.

12:02.500 --> 12:05.667
Oh, my God. OK, that's it. We're
going straight to my house.

12:05.667 --> 12:08.041
Come. Get up!
Come on. Come on!

12:08.041 --> 12:11.166
We're going to go and we're
going to get some wine on
the way.

12:11.166 --> 12:13.792
Andrea, I can't drink.
I'm an alcoholic.

12:13.792 --> 12:16.875
- No, babe, you're not.
- What?

12:16.875 --> 12:20.417
Hold on a minute. I might want
that in pink. You're not an
alcoholic.

12:20.417 --> 12:23.458
A judge made you go to AA
because you got drunk
before a flight

12:23.458 --> 12:25.458
and had a huge freak-out
on the plane.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.875
Oh, great.
So I'm afraid to fly too.

12:27.875 --> 12:31.333
Afraid to fly coach. You forced
me to come along to serve you
drinks

12:31.333 --> 12:33.750
so you felt like
you were in first class.

12:33.750 --> 12:37.083
- So I can drink?
- Oh, yeah.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.667

13:37.875 --> 13:39.041
Yeah, to hell with him.

13:39.041 --> 13:41.500
Yeah,
he was a son of a bitch.

13:41.500 --> 13:45.250
Don't say that about him. Why
would you say that about him?

13:46.291 --> 13:48.041
I think
I heard it somewhere.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.125
Kevin was a kind
and thoughtful man.

13:50.125 --> 13:53.125
- He was so sweet.
- He was an ass.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.250
I'm confused
about my role here.

13:56.250 --> 14:00.333
I had such big plans
for them.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.041
The two of them were going
to buy a second house

14:03.041 --> 14:05.041
in Asheville, North Carolina.

14:05.041 --> 14:09.959
Not Boca Raton. It's way too
humid, you know, my hair would
never do...

14:09.959 --> 14:13.375
And Asheville has this

14:13.375 --> 14:16.250
thriving mountain
crafts community.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.792
Oh, God.

14:17.792 --> 14:21.834
That was my own fault. I
completely misjudged that Kevin.

14:21.834 --> 14:24.667
I thought he could handle
a girl with head problems.

14:24.667 --> 14:28.041
Mom, it's not your fault, OK?
It's not.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.041
It's my fault.
You know why?

14:31.375 --> 14:34.041
Because I'm unlovable.
[sobbing]

14:34.041 --> 14:36.041
You are not unlovable.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.208
Oh, honey, no, no.

14:38.208 --> 14:42.000
I mean true, there were times
you were difficult to warm up
to,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.250
but even then, I loved you.

14:45.583 --> 14:47.041
Babies are hard.

14:47.041 --> 14:48.583
I love you, too, Sam.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.709
And what about Todd?
Todd loved you. Hmm?

14:55.542 --> 15:00.458
Todd!

15:00.458 --> 15:05.041
- Todd!
- It might interest you to know

15:05.041 --> 15:08.000
this isn't even close
to the most embarrassing thing

15:08.000 --> 15:10.041
I've seen you do
on this sidewalk.

15:10.041 --> 15:12.291
Shh. Todd!

15:12.291 --> 15:15.500
- May I ask
why you're doing this?
- I want Todd.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.917
"Who" is no longer a secret to
anyone on this side of the lake.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.417
I was wondering why.

15:22.083 --> 15:26.542
'Cause I need to know
if he really loved me. OK?

15:26.542 --> 15:28.458
Todd!

15:28.458 --> 15:30.834
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

15:30.834 --> 15:33.041
- Let's get some coffee in you.
- Todd!

15:33.041 --> 15:34.458
OK.

15:34.458 --> 15:37.583
Oh! Good news, Frank. I don't
have a drinking problem anymore.

15:39.041 --> 15:42.041
- Gee, oopsie-daisy.
- No. Now it's mine.

15:45.667 --> 15:48.917
Ooh...
Drinking is like love.

15:48.917 --> 15:51.083
It starts out OK.

15:51.083 --> 15:54.041
The singing and
the laughing part is real fun,

15:54.041 --> 15:59.333
and then it just takes this ugly
turn around the crying and the
yelling part.

15:59.333 --> 16:01.709
I would tell you
about the throwing up part,

16:01.709 --> 16:03.959
but I don't want
to ruin the surprise.

16:05.166 --> 16:06.709
That is it.

16:07.709 --> 16:11.834
I am never falling
in love again.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.542
Of course you will.

16:14.542 --> 16:18.667
And it may hurt.
But you will survive.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.667
Oh, my God!

16:20.667 --> 16:22.750
You speak the words
of Gloria!

16:22.750 --> 16:25.333
My wife and I karaoke.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.125
She does an excellent Devo.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.250
You are so lucky.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.709
You have a wife.

16:31.709 --> 16:33.667
I bet you she has a drawer.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.834
She has all the drawers.

16:35.834 --> 16:40.667
Yeah, but she loves you.
Someone loves you.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.500
How great is that?

16:43.500 --> 16:45.083
Someone once said,

16:45.083 --> 16:49.291
"The joy in life is not in
hearing the words 'I love you,'

16:49.291 --> 16:51.959
but in being lucky enough
to say them."

16:51.959 --> 16:54.959
Wow, that's beautiful.

16:54.959 --> 16:58.583
- Who said that?
- The lead character
in my screenplay.

16:58.583 --> 17:01.667
It happens just before
the shark gets him.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.250
And he was right.

17:03.250 --> 17:07.417
I mean, some people never do let
themselves express their love.

17:07.417 --> 17:11.125
How can you not express it,
you know?

17:11.125 --> 17:14.667
Like who can't express love?

17:16.083 --> 17:17.667
Wait.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.667
Wait.

17:20.417 --> 17:21.667
Wait.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.417
- Hey, Sam?
- Uh-huh.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.834
- Are we living together?
- [chuckles]

17:26.834 --> 17:29.792
- Don't be an idiot.
- Well, I mean I'm here
all the time,

17:29.792 --> 17:32.667
I've got a drawer,
I've got a third of the closet.

17:32.667 --> 17:36.667
No, we are not living together
because that would imply

17:36.667 --> 17:40.166
that you would be paying
half of the mortgage. And I...

17:40.166 --> 17:41.709
...don't see that happening.

17:41.709 --> 17:45.375
Yeah, I don't either.
Yeah, but I can still
hang out here, right?

17:45.375 --> 17:47.834
Eat what's in the fridge,
sleep in your bed?

17:47.834 --> 17:50.834
If you stopped,
I'd kill you.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.375
I love you, too.

17:57.667 --> 18:00.417
Did I not say it to Todd?

18:00.417 --> 18:02.500
Maybe I didn't.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.333
Maybe I never even told him
that I loved him.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.250
Todd!

18:10.458 --> 18:12.250
What? What's going on?

18:12.250 --> 18:14.083
Did I ever tell you
that I loved you?

18:14.083 --> 18:16.291
- Wait, I'm sorry?
- Did I?

18:16.291 --> 18:17.959
Out loud? No.

18:17.959 --> 18:20.792
Well, you scratched it
into the trunk of my car once.

18:20.792 --> 18:23.542
- It was OK, it was an old car.
- Well, I did.

18:23.542 --> 18:26.458
- What?
- I loved you.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.709
I'm sorry that I didn't
tell you before, OK?

18:28.709 --> 18:31.500
But I'm pretty sure
that I did.

18:31.500 --> 18:35.000
I mean then.
Not now. Before.

18:35.000 --> 18:39.166
All right, let's just pretend
like it's a long time ago, OK?

18:39.166 --> 18:41.375
Just, ready?

18:41.375 --> 18:43.667
I love you!

18:43.667 --> 18:46.667
Then. Because not now.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.250
FYI.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.709
- OK, then.
- You bet.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.250
[mumbles indistinctly]

19:08.125 --> 19:09.667
Todd...

19:10.667 --> 19:12.000
...I love you!

19:12.000 --> 19:13.959
Shut up, Russ.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.083
Well, I expressed it.

19:21.083 --> 19:24.041
- I expressed the hell
out of it.
- It went well, then.

19:24.041 --> 19:27.667
Yeah. Yeah.
In fact, from now on,

19:27.667 --> 19:30.083
I'm only going to say
"I love you" to guys

19:30.083 --> 19:33.083
after I don't
love them anymore.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.959
Because it goes
so much better.

19:34.959 --> 19:38.041
- Sounds like a plan.
- Yep.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.750
OK, except for this once.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.667
- Frank...
- Don't you dare.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.291
I wasn't. Really.

19:53.250 --> 19:56.917
[Samantha] So love
really is a battlefield.

19:56.917 --> 20:00.542
I learned that from another
prophet on that CD at Andrea's.

20:02.667 --> 20:04.875
The difference is,
in battle,

20:04.875 --> 20:08.834
you're supposed to shoot all
your ammo at once and
annihilate the other side.

20:08.834 --> 20:12.709
In love, sometimes you just got
to hold your fire a little

20:12.709 --> 20:14.208
and see what happens.

20:14.208 --> 20:17.417
Tracy, grab me that file on the
Woodcrest property, please?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.208
In a minute, sweetie,
I got to dry.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.792
At least I know
I can express myself now.

20:21.792 --> 20:24.417
You know what, Tracy?

20:24.417 --> 20:29.000
I'm not sure if this whole
girlfriend thing is working out
so well.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.583
- It works for me.
- No, you work for me.

20:33.583 --> 20:37.000
I am your boss
and you are my assistant,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.667
which means that you have
my Tanzania Peaberry

20:39.667 --> 20:41.667
on my desk when I get here
in the morning

20:41.667 --> 20:43.792
and keep your ass
in that chair at night

20:43.792 --> 20:46.291
until you're sure
I'm at home in my jammies.

20:46.291 --> 20:49.875
- Are we clear, girlfriend?
- Yes, Miss Newly.

20:55.291 --> 20:59.709
[Samantha] Maybe the key
to survival in love and war
is balance.

20:59.709 --> 21:02.917
Did I say please?
I'm sorry, please.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.667
And thank you.

21:04.667 --> 21:06.667
Now get back to work!

21:06.667 --> 21:10.041
- Please. Right now!
- Oh...

21:10.041 --> 21:11.917
Thank you.

21:11.917 --> 21:12.917
Please.
