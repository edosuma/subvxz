Ew, nothing to fear
but fur itself.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.374
Hmm.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.216
What's he doing down there?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.285
Usual stuff:
Take over the world,

08:40.287 --> 08:41.453
"I want to be the monkey king,

08:41.455 --> 08:42.754
blah, blah, blah
blah, blah, blah."

08:42.756 --> 08:43.654
It's all about him.

08:43.656 --> 08:44.689
Shouldn't we do something?

08:44.691 --> 08:48.493
Eyes on the prize, Wade.

08:48.495 --> 08:53.031
Today dawns the age
of the phantom monkeys

08:53.033 --> 08:57.235
with me as supreme monkey king!

08:57.237 --> 08:59.604
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

08:59.606 --> 09:02.140
All:
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

09:02.142 --> 09:04.643
Told ya. Monkey king.
So predictable.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.212
Ron, are you sure you took
this book on a mission?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.012
Dude, yeah, I...

09:08.014 --> 09:11.816
score! There it is! I told
you I'd find it! Neener!

09:11.818 --> 09:13.385
[Snap snap]

09:13.387 --> 09:16.121
Fetch me the ancient text.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.522
[Roars]

09:17.524 --> 09:18.122
The book!

09:18.124 --> 09:20.258
They're stealing
the ancient text!

09:20.260 --> 09:21.526
Ninjas, attack!

09:21.528 --> 09:22.561
Uh-oh!

09:22.563 --> 09:25.263
Huh? What?
Just stop doing that!

09:25.265 --> 09:27.499
Aah!

09:27.800 --> 09:28.499
Ron Stoppable.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.603
You're the only one who ever
gets my name right.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.571
I respect that.

09:32.573 --> 09:33.371
Be that as it may,

09:33.373 --> 09:36.608
behold the might
of the phantom monkeys!

09:36.610 --> 09:39.578
Aah! What sort
of magic is this?

09:39.580 --> 09:40.545
The best kind.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.846
Science!
Science!

09:41.848 --> 09:43.348
Aah!

09:43.849 --> 09:45.584
Gotta get that book!

09:45.586 --> 09:49.321
Hyah, hyah, hyah! Ha!

09:49.323 --> 09:50.755
Aah!

09:50.757 --> 09:51.555
My backpack!

09:51.557 --> 09:55.293
Ron, you had Kim's book
with you the whole time?!

09:55.295 --> 09:57.395
Oh, ha ha. Wow.

09:57.397 --> 09:59.397
Guess I never
took it out of my backpack.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.533
Heh heh. That's
good news, huh, Wade?

10:01.535 --> 10:05.470
The ancient text.
Now.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.409
Aah!

10:12.812 --> 10:15.246
My monkey idols!

10:15.248 --> 10:17.882
Righteous monkey moves,
little buddy!

10:17.884 --> 10:19.351
[Giggles]

10:19.353 --> 10:21.519
Booya!

10:23.222 --> 10:25.256
[Kim licks label]

10:25.258 --> 10:27.792
My lips are numb.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.793
Ron?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.295
Shh.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.430
[Gasps]

10:32.865 --> 10:36.234
Hmm? The library's closed!

10:36.236 --> 10:37.034
Um, yes, hello!

10:37.036 --> 10:38.837
I just wanted to
check out this book

10:38.839 --> 10:41.139
<i>a brief history of cheese.</i>

10:41.141 --> 10:42.273
Ooh! What do you know?

10:42.275 --> 10:44.409
It was right here
on the shelf all along!

10:44.411 --> 10:47.812
Looks like you made a little
mistake, miss hatchet.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.381
That's highly unlikely.

10:49.383 --> 10:53.451
Apparently, the hatchet
decimal system is flawed.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.686
Hardly! Hmph.

10:54.688 --> 10:58.223
Well, it appears
you're free to go...

10:58.225 --> 10:59.023
For now...

10:59.025 --> 11:02.761
But there will come a day when
you'll forget to return a book

11:02.763 --> 11:05.463
and I'll be waiting for you.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.465
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

11:07.467 --> 11:09.567
Wow. She's wound
pretty tight, huh?

11:09.569 --> 11:10.935
You have no idea.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.238
Oh, hey, while you were
stuck in library lock-up,

11:13.240 --> 11:16.675
Rufus and I were out saving
the world from monkey fist.

11:16.677 --> 11:17.275
Really?

11:17.277 --> 11:18.877
Yep. He was gonna use
this ancient text

11:18.879 --> 11:21.246
to take over the world.

11:21.248 --> 11:24.549
Uh, Ron, this is
my overdue cheese book.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.550
Where is the...

11:25.552 --> 11:28.853
aah! Oh... No.

11:28.855 --> 11:34.192
Miss hatchet:
Aah! Aah! Aah!
