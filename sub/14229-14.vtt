My go-pack!

01:18.380 --> 01:19.920
Where'd you find it?

01:19.920 --> 01:21.710
Armando discovered
some of our old things

01:21.710 --> 01:24.540
that the servants
hid in the attic
when Shuriki took over.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.580
This is perfect!

01:28.580 --> 01:30.750
- Good morning!
- Hi, abuela!

01:30.750 --> 01:34.250
Mi hija, are you excited
for your first day of school?

01:34.250 --> 01:37.710
Oh, yeah! I mean,
being castle-schooled
was fun and all,

01:37.710 --> 01:41.120
but it's not the same
as going to school
with the other kids.

01:41.120 --> 01:45.710
Maybe so, but no one
can play freeze tag
like me and your abuelo.

01:45.710 --> 01:47.290
Is abuelo playing
right now?

01:48.420 --> 01:50.500
You're it!

01:50.500 --> 01:52.210
Whatever you say,
mi amor.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.620
All right, here we are.

01:56.620 --> 01:57.920
Oh! Have a good day!

01:57.920 --> 01:58.960
I will.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.380
What is it?

02:03.380 --> 02:05.250
I'm just
a little nervous.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.080
You know, about
making friends.

02:08.080 --> 02:11.210
Isa, you're smart
and funny and sweet.

02:11.210 --> 02:13.380
Everyone's gonna want
to be your friend.

02:13.380 --> 02:14.540
You'll see.

02:14.540 --> 02:16.120
Okay. Bye!

02:18.000 --> 02:20.540
Did you see that
ball game yesterday?

02:24.790 --> 02:28.040
Oh! Class. Class!

02:28.040 --> 02:31.420
Can I have
your attention, please?

02:32.580 --> 02:34.620
One, two, three!

02:34.620 --> 02:36.040
Eyes on me!

02:36.040 --> 02:38.460
One, two, eyes on you!

02:38.460 --> 02:39.750
That's more like it!

02:39.750 --> 02:42.380
We have a special new student
joining our class.

02:42.380 --> 02:47.540
Let's give an extra-warm welcome
to Princess Isabelle!

02:47.540 --> 02:49.210
Hi, Princess Isabelle!

02:49.210 --> 02:51.710
Hi. You can just
call me Isabelle.

02:51.710 --> 02:55.920
Okay, Isabelle, you'll be
sitting with Quique and Amara.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.120
Great.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.000
Okay, class,
our first subject today

03:00.000 --> 03:02.710
- is chemistry.
- I love chemistry!

03:02.710 --> 03:05.580
My dream is to go
to the Science Academy someday.

03:05.580 --> 03:07.830
Dream? That sounds
more like a nightmare.

03:07.830 --> 03:09.790
- Ahem!

03:09.790 --> 03:12.620
Quique, Amara,
hocus pocus!

03:12.620 --> 03:14.420
Let's all focus.

03:14.420 --> 03:17.420
Good! Now, before we
get started, safety first.

03:17.420 --> 03:19.670
Please put on your goggles.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.620
You brought
your own goggles?

03:23.620 --> 03:25.670
Yeah! I got them
for my eighth birthday.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.460
Today we're going to make
extra-bouncy Avaloran rubber

03:31.460 --> 03:34.750
using two ingredients:
sap from the elastica tree,

03:34.750 --> 03:37.380
and juice from moon vines.

03:37.380 --> 03:40.580
Can anyone tell me
where these plants grow?

03:40.580 --> 03:41.790
Isabelle?

03:41.790 --> 03:43.620
The Crystal Caverns!

03:43.620 --> 03:45.670
Exactly, which is
where we're going

03:45.670 --> 03:47.330
on our field trip
tomorrow.

03:47.330 --> 03:49.580
- Ooh!
- The Crystal Caverns
are boring.

03:49.580 --> 03:52.210
You've seen one rock,
you've seen 'em all, right?

03:52.210 --> 03:55.500
- Right.
- Actually, there are
three different types of rocks,

03:55.500 --> 03:57.750
igneous, sedimentary,
and metamorphic.

03:57.750 --> 04:00.120
Then you've seen three rocks,
you've seen them all.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.710
Oh. Okay.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.420
First, using
your measuring cylinder,

04:05.420 --> 04:08.040
pour equal amounts
of sap and juice

04:08.040 --> 04:09.580
into a beaker.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.620
Forget that!
I can just eyeball it.

04:11.620 --> 04:13.670
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

04:13.670 --> 04:16.250
If you don't measure
the ingredients correctly,

04:16.250 --> 04:17.750
the experiment
might not work.

04:17.750 --> 04:19.500
I know what I'm doing, okay?

04:19.500 --> 04:21.580
I've already taken this class,
like, three times.

04:21.580 --> 04:22.830
Four times.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.580
See? I really know
what I'm doing.

04:24.580 --> 04:26.120
Hmm, suit yourself.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.920
Next, stir
the ingredients well,

04:28.920 --> 04:31.170
then turn over
your beaker, and...

04:31.170 --> 04:33.540
super-bouncy rubber!

04:34.790 --> 04:36.620
Ah, this experiment
doesn't work!

04:37.790 --> 04:39.620
Way to go, Isabelle!

04:39.620 --> 04:41.790
You're the first one
to get it right!

04:41.790 --> 04:44.620
Huh. Princess Know-It-All.

04:44.620 --> 04:46.540
What's so funny?

04:46.540 --> 04:47.790
Nothing.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.830
BYSTANDER:
Good shot, Quique!

04:55.830 --> 04:57.710
What's this game called?

04:57.710 --> 05:00.000
Feed the Jaquin.
You get five balls.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.710
Every time you throw one
through the Jaquin's mouth,

05:02.710 --> 05:04.000
you get a point.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.080
Four out of five!
Beat that, Amara!

05:08.790 --> 05:11.250
Looks like you're gonna
miss five out of five.

05:15.460 --> 05:17.420
If I could make
a suggestion...

05:17.420 --> 05:19.210
You have a good
throwing arm,

05:19.210 --> 05:21.580
but if you change
the angle of your throw,

05:21.580 --> 05:22.960
you'd hit your mark.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.170
- I'll show you!

05:25.170 --> 05:28.620
See, if you just
angled your throw
seven degrees that way

05:28.620 --> 05:30.080
and release the ball here,

05:30.080 --> 05:31.960
then you'll get the ball
in the hole.

05:31.960 --> 05:33.580
Okay, I'll try it.

05:33.580 --> 05:34.580
Hmph.

05:38.420 --> 05:40.580
Whoo! I made it!

05:40.580 --> 05:41.920
Eh, you got lucky.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.670
And who does math
during recess, anyway?

05:44.670 --> 05:46.670
Actually, it's physics.

05:46.670 --> 05:50.620
Sorry, smarty pants.
I mean, smarty gown!

05:50.620 --> 05:52.460
What's wrong
with being smart?

05:52.460 --> 05:55.580
I bet she even
named her school bag!

06:04.670 --> 06:06.330
Oh, here she comes!

06:09.420 --> 06:11.290
So, do you like
your teacher?

06:11.290 --> 06:12.420
Yes.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.670
- No.

06:13.670 --> 06:14.580
Did you make any friends?

06:14.580 --> 06:15.880
I don't want
to talk about it.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.500
Hmm.

06:22.710 --> 06:27.420
"I bet she even
named her school bag!"

06:27.420 --> 06:28.460
Ugh!

06:29.620 --> 06:31.040
Ow!

06:31.040 --> 06:33.790
Um, you want to tell me
what happened at school today?

06:33.790 --> 06:36.420
You know, before
any more bags get hurt?

06:36.420 --> 06:38.670
I wanna be alone.

06:38.670 --> 06:42.040
- Okay. I'll leave.
- Thanks.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.120
Right after you tell me
what's going on.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.620
Gah!

06:45.620 --> 06:49.330
Did you have trouble
making friends today?

06:49.330 --> 06:50.620
Give it some time!

06:50.620 --> 06:52.380
You'll make friends soon.

06:52.380 --> 06:54.710
No, I won't!
Quique doesn't like me,

06:54.710 --> 06:56.790
and if Quique
doesn't like you,

06:56.790 --> 06:58.250
none of the kids
like you!

06:58.250 --> 07:00.790
He's, like, the boss
of everybody.

07:00.790 --> 07:02.620
Then I feel sorry
for Quique.

07:02.620 --> 07:03.920
Why?

07:03.920 --> 07:05.710
Because he's missing out

07:05.710 --> 07:08.500
on getting to know
the smartest girl in school.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.000
I don't want to be
the smartest girl in school!

Isabelle told me
she didn't have

10:46.670 --> 10:48.330
a good first day
of school.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.210
I wonder if that's why
she's acting this way.

10:50.210 --> 10:53.790
Crown Princess Elena,
Princess Isabelle
forgot her satchel.

10:53.790 --> 10:55.790
Oh! I'll take it
to her myself.

10:55.790 --> 10:58.790
This'll give me an excuse

10:58.790 --> 11:02.170
Remember, use
the measuring cylinder.

It's important to be precise

Isabelle, I expected more
from a princess.

11:20.330 --> 11:21.830
That was so cool.

11:21.830 --> 11:23.620
Really? Yes!

I guess.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.040
Oh, no.

11:30.040 --> 11:31.710
What brings you
here today?

11:31.710 --> 11:34.670
My sister Isabelle
forgot her go-pack.

11:34.670 --> 11:36.830
I knew she
named her bag!

11:36.830 --> 11:38.120
Here you go.

11:38.120 --> 11:40.750
Thanks, but I don't want it.

11:40.750 --> 11:41.750
Are you sure?

11:41.750 --> 11:43.330
Don't you need
your sketchbook,

11:43.330 --> 11:44.750
science kit,
protractor...

11:44.750 --> 11:45.750
I'm sure.

11:45.750 --> 11:46.750
Okay.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.750
Well, sorry for
the interruption.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.750
It's no problem,
Princess Elena.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.790
We were just about to leave
on our field trip

11:52.790 --> 11:54.750
to the Crystal Caverns.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.000
A field trip? Oh!

11:56.000 --> 11:58.330
Did you need
another chaperone!

11:58.330 --> 12:01.330
Why, yes, that would
be wonderful,

12:01.330 --> 12:02.500
wouldn't it, class?

12:02.500 --> 12:03.830
- Yeah!
- All right!

12:03.830 --> 12:05.380
Great! Isa,

12:05.380 --> 12:07.170
you and your friends
can ride with me.

12:07.170 --> 12:09.000
- Whoo!
- Oh...

12:09.000 --> 12:11.460
I'd like to welcome
you all to one

12:11.460 --> 12:14.380
of the most wondrous spots
in the whole kingdom,

12:14.380 --> 12:16.620
the Crystal Caverns!

12:18.670 --> 12:20.790
Looks like a big hole
in the wall to me.

12:22.330 --> 12:24.000
Excuse me,
what's your name?

12:24.000 --> 12:25.330
Quique.

12:25.330 --> 12:28.750
Oh, so you're the boss
of everyone.

12:28.750 --> 12:31.750
Well, Quique, please
quiet down and listen
to Sra. Marisol.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.460
Yes, Princess.

12:34.380 --> 12:38.040
You mean
Princess No Fun?

12:38.040 --> 12:40.460
Isa, can I talk
to you for a second?

12:40.460 --> 12:42.000
Whoa, okay!

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You know better
than to be this rude.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.170
What's going on?

12:45.170 --> 12:46.830
You told me I could
fix anything,

12:46.830 --> 12:50.170
so I fixed myself,
and now I have friends.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.330
True friends like you
for who you are.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.330
You shouldn't have
to change yourself.

12:54.330 --> 12:55.580
Well, it worked.

12:55.580 --> 12:57.500
We'll talk about this
more tonight,

12:57.500 --> 13:00.290
but right now you need to pay
attention to Sra. Marisol.

13:00.290 --> 13:02.290
Okay, okay! Ugh!

13:02.290 --> 13:04.880
The sun crystals
illuminate the caverns,

13:04.880 --> 13:07.210
but what makes them
extra-special

13:07.210 --> 13:09.500
is that their light
has the same effect

13:09.500 --> 13:11.580
on plants as the sun!

13:11.580 --> 13:13.500
That's kind of cool.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.420
Then why am I yawning?

13:15.420 --> 13:16.790
Look at that!

13:16.790 --> 13:20.040
This field trip
just got interesting.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.670
Let's go
check it out!

13:21.670 --> 13:23.170
Maybe we shouldn't.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.620
Those caves haven't
been explored yet.

13:25.620 --> 13:27.670
Then we'll be the first
to explore them!

13:27.670 --> 13:31.250
That's how those moon vines
and elastica trees over there...

13:31.250 --> 13:32.460
Go, go, go!

13:32.460 --> 13:34.120
Oh...

13:38.920 --> 13:40.040
You're it!

13:40.040 --> 13:41.250
Agh!

13:41.250 --> 13:43.000
Ha ha, missed me!

13:43.000 --> 13:44.120
Gotcha!

13:44.120 --> 13:45.790
Isn't this better

13:45.790 --> 13:48.580
than listening
to Sra. Marisol?

13:48.580 --> 13:49.920
Oh, yeah!

13:49.920 --> 13:51.620
The next cavern
we're going to see

13:51.620 --> 13:54.670
has crystals in every
color of the rainbow!

13:54.670 --> 13:56.540
- And a few more!

13:56.540 --> 13:57.670
Where did they go?

13:59.790 --> 14:03.620
Isabelle! You didn't.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.420
Did you hear that?

14:19.080 --> 14:21.750
We should head back.
This doesn't look stable.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.670
It's fine! Uh uh uh! See?

14:30.790 --> 14:32.580
Aah!

14:32.580 --> 14:35.750
Whoa!

14:35.750 --> 14:36.620
Whew.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.330
Where are we?

14:43.330 --> 14:45.040
And how are we gonna
get out of here?

14:45.040 --> 14:46.040
I don't know.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.580
Nobody knows
where we are.

14:47.580 --> 14:48.670
Don't worry, Amara.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.670
Maybe we can walk
on that stem,

14:50.670 --> 14:52.670
like as tightrope!

14:52.670 --> 14:54.380
Whoa! That won't work.

14:54.380 --> 14:55.750
Now what?

14:55.750 --> 14:58.120
There's only one thing
left to do.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.460
Help!

15:00.460 --> 15:04.040
Isabel! Amara!

15:04.040 --> 15:05.290
Quique!

15:05.290 --> 15:06.750
ISABELLE: Help!

15:06.750 --> 15:09.080
- Isa!
- Help me!

15:10.460 --> 15:12.170
We're down here!

15:14.170 --> 15:15.750
Get us out of here!

15:15.750 --> 15:18.580
All right!
Uh, I'll go get help.

15:18.580 --> 15:22.250
- No! Don't go!
- If the stem snaps,
we'll float away!

15:22.250 --> 15:25.620
Okay. Okay.
Let me think.

15:33.880 --> 15:34.880
Hurry!

15:34.880 --> 15:36.580
I'm coming, Isa!

15:36.580 --> 15:38.380
Oh, I hope this holds.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.170
No, stop!
You're breaking it!

15:56.170 --> 15:58.830
Okay! Uh, then, uh,

15:58.830 --> 16:00.170
jump over to me
one at a time.

16:00.170 --> 16:02.830
Amara, you can
go first.

16:08.670 --> 16:09.880
Who's next?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.540
Quique, your turn.

16:11.540 --> 16:13.500
Ah, ah...

16:15.710 --> 16:17.290
Aah!

16:18.420 --> 16:21.750
Ugh! No, you go,
Isabelle.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.250
Isa, it's only
a couple of feet.

16:27.250 --> 16:28.830
Okay.

16:33.790 --> 16:35.670
All right. Quique.

16:35.670 --> 16:37.080
I-- I can't!

16:37.080 --> 16:39.290
- Yes, you can.
- Uh-uh!

16:39.290 --> 16:42.000
I'll tell you what.
I'll just jump over to you,

16:42.000 --> 16:43.790
and then we'll jump
back together.

16:43.790 --> 16:45.710
But you're bigger
than he is, Elena.

16:45.710 --> 16:47.000
The stem might snap!

16:47.000 --> 16:48.620
I can't leave him
out there!

16:48.620 --> 16:50.120
I'll just lighten
my load.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.460
- Mm!
- Whoa!

16:54.460 --> 16:55.710
Aah!

16:55.710 --> 16:57.960
Whoa!

16:57.960 --> 17:00.380
Whoaa!

17:00.380 --> 17:01.500
- Elena!
- Quique!

17:07.620 --> 17:09.880
Isabelle, you're smart!
What do we do?

17:09.880 --> 17:11.670
I have to fix this!

17:12.830 --> 17:15.540
Let's see. There!

17:15.540 --> 17:17.880
I know how to save them!

17:17.880 --> 17:20.120
But I'm gonna need
my go-pack!

17:23.580 --> 17:25.790
Okay. We'll have to jump in
and swim for it.

17:25.790 --> 17:27.620
But I can't swim!

17:27.620 --> 17:29.000
Oh!

17:29.000 --> 17:30.620
I have a plan!

17:30.620 --> 17:32.710
Okay, but hurry!

17:33.750 --> 17:36.250
Okay, we're here.

17:39.670 --> 17:42.170
Isabelle, look!

17:47.620 --> 17:50.380
We'd better move fast!
Grab those rocks!

17:52.790 --> 17:56.750
Use my goggles
to slingshot the rocks
at the crystal's weak spot.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.210
Well, where's
the weak spot?

17:58.210 --> 17:59.620
The narrow part!

17:59.620 --> 18:05.710
Aim it... at a 56-degree angle
and then release.

18:08.710 --> 18:10.420
You can do this.

18:13.750 --> 18:15.540
- I hit it!
- Go! Keep going!

18:21.880 --> 18:23.290
Aah!

18:23.290 --> 18:24.540
Hang on, Quique!

18:24.540 --> 18:25.670
Whoa!

18:25.670 --> 18:28.960
Uh-oh! We don't want
to run into those.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.750
If I could just...

18:33.620 --> 18:35.540
I'm gonna pull us in!

18:38.620 --> 18:39.620
No!

18:41.170 --> 18:42.580
Hold on!

18:49.000 --> 18:51.380
It's gonna be okay, Quique.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.620
What's that noise?

18:58.460 --> 18:59.880
They're almost here!

18:59.880 --> 19:01.920
But we only have
one more rock!

19:01.920 --> 19:03.120
Then don't miss!

19:08.540 --> 19:10.500
- No!

19:12.210 --> 19:14.830
Eh. Oh. I got it!

19:17.040 --> 19:18.210
Use this!

19:18.210 --> 19:19.620
Okay. I'll try.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.880
Hurry!

19:22.040 --> 19:24.710
Girls, what are you doing?

19:29.620 --> 19:31.540
Huh?

19:34.380 --> 19:36.620
- Quique, grab on!
- Aah!

19:37.620 --> 19:39.420
Aah!

19:44.790 --> 19:46.880
Whoo-hoo!

19:48.620 --> 19:50.420
Isa!

19:51.750 --> 19:55.290
I'm sorry for all
the trouble I caused, Elena.

19:55.290 --> 19:58.420
Making friends
can be hard sometimes,

19:58.420 --> 20:01.210
but you're great
just the way you are!

20:01.210 --> 20:03.670
You save us by just
being yourself.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.580
You're right.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.580
Now, how do we
get out of here.

20:08.580 --> 20:10.790
Hmm.

20:10.790 --> 20:12.880
I have an idea.

20:15.830 --> 20:19.920
Exactly one cup
of elastica sap...

20:19.920 --> 20:21.040
Okay.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.420
...and one cup
of moon vine juice.

20:23.420 --> 20:24.620
You got it.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.790
Now, pour them
into the beaker.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.960
And that's how you make
Avalor rubber.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.330
- Whoa!
- Cool!

20:30.330 --> 20:33.460
All right. If my calculations
are correct,

20:33.460 --> 20:36.120
we'll be able to bounce
on out of here!

20:40.210 --> 20:41.420
Yes!

20:42.920 --> 20:44.710
There's plenty more
for everyone!

20:44.710 --> 20:46.080
Who's next?

20:50.960 --> 20:52.960
There you are!

20:52.960 --> 20:55.210
I was just about to call
the Royal Guards!

20:55.210 --> 20:56.880
Where did you all go?

20:56.880 --> 20:59.330
Isabelle, Quique,
and Amara wandered off

20:59.330 --> 21:01.500
and got into a bit
of trouble.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.580
I'm sorry.
It was my idea,

21:03.580 --> 21:05.460
but I'll never
do it again.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.710
Me, neither.

21:06.710 --> 21:07.830
I'm sure you won't,

21:07.830 --> 21:09.620
and do you know why?

21:09.620 --> 21:12.080
Because the three of you
are going back to school

21:12.080 --> 21:14.420
to clean the schoolyard
while the rest of us

21:14.420 --> 21:15.920
see the Glowing Grotto.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.710
That's the best part.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.330
I'll take them back
in the royal coach.

21:20.330 --> 21:22.580
Thank you, Princess.

21:23.670 --> 21:25.580
Aw, we have
to clean the school?

21:25.580 --> 21:27.460
I don't even
clean my room!

21:27.460 --> 21:29.620
I think I have a way
to make it fun.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.750
Great shot, Isabelle!

21:34.750 --> 21:36.170
Can you help me
with my throw?

21:36.170 --> 21:40.750
Sure. Just angle your arm...

21:40.750 --> 21:42.330
seven degrees this way.

21:42.330 --> 21:43.920
Now, throw it!

21:43.920 --> 21:45.670
Hup, ah!

21:45.670 --> 21:46.960
Got it!

21:46.960 --> 21:49.670
Cleaning up is gonna be
more fun than I thought.

21:51.710 --> 21:52.920
Come on, Isabelle!

22:06.790 --> 22:09.380
