WEBVTT

01:03.564 --> 01:05.556
If they ask you

01:06.608 --> 01:08.600
who's your President,

01:09.194 --> 01:12.904
tell them our President
is Bachir Gemayel.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.869
<i>May the Lord be with you.</i>

01:20.205 --> 01:21.696
The Christian Party...

01:26.420 --> 01:27.752
The Christian Party...

01:28.422 --> 01:30.379
is like the Bible.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.749
You know, in the Bible,

01:33.010 --> 01:34.467
there's the Old Testament,

01:34.720 --> 01:36.052
and the New Testament.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.721
In the past, we used to say,

01:39.641 --> 01:43.055
only the Christian Party
protects Beirut.

01:43.437 --> 01:46.805
Today, what do we say?

01:47.232 --> 01:51.101
The Christian Party supports the State!

02:20.599 --> 02:22.386
You should have seen him today,

02:23.143 --> 02:24.805
he was shining bright.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.182
I see him every day, thank God.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.143
I'd like to take the photo down.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.265
Why?

02:31.526 --> 02:34.735
I feel like
I'm under 24-hour surveillance, Tony.

02:34.988 --> 02:38.356
What if he moved in with us?

02:39.785 --> 02:42.152
Great. Why not?

02:42.788 --> 02:45.246
It gets very hot, 9 months a year.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.581
Do you want the AC on?

02:47.834 --> 02:49.416
I'd like to move out.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.165
We're going to name you Streeda.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.891
I want a bigger, quieter place
for the baby.

03:05.977 --> 03:08.594
Shirine, we already talked about this.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.563
We're saving to buy this place.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.850
I work here.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.736
Darling,

03:17.989 --> 03:20.106
let's move to Damour.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.067
You have a family house there.

03:23.328 --> 03:26.116
Many people have returned.
They're rebuilding.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.831
The church is restored and blessed...

03:29.084 --> 03:30.291
I'm fine here!

04:25.390 --> 04:27.382
Shirine, come have a cup of coffee.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.759
NeXt time. Thank you.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.732
I need a rear shaft for a BMW 325.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.904
How much?

04:46.161 --> 04:47.072
$40.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.161
I'll send you Eli.

04:51.666 --> 04:52.372
Eli,

04:53.043 --> 04:54.875
it's missing the stamp.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.085
How shall I file this?

04:57.339 --> 05:00.457
I looked everywhere.
Only found it in the suburbs.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.710
Total pain in the ass.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.836
Checkpoints everywhere.

05:06.348 --> 05:09.136
Your transmission is worn out.
The clutch is slipping.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.678
I just had them replaced.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.975
They can't even get the name right.
The S is missing.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.182
It's totally worn out.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.815
Used German is better
than brand new Chinese.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.655
I want those guys to finish the job,
not sluff off.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.870
Get rid of this cable.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.414
Have them move faster.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.875
Why is it like this?

05:37.212 --> 05:39.920
I want him on the 4th floor.
I talked to the neighbors.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.755
<i>- Yasser.</i>
- Go ahead.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.251
<i>The cement truck is here.</i>

05:45.512 --> 05:48.676
Park it on the street
and pour the concrete 8 cm thick.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.219
<i>A car is blocking the street.</i>

05:54.062 --> 05:56.520
<i>Boss! Do you copy?</i>

06:11.705 --> 06:14.743
There's a problem with your gutter.
We need to look at it.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.375
What kind of problem?

06:19.129 --> 06:21.246
People are getting sprayed.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.425
Use the other side of the street.

07:11.973 --> 07:13.930
What's going on?

07:18.063 --> 07:19.520
Fucking prick!

07:30.116 --> 07:31.527
Mr. Tony,

07:32.369 --> 07:34.110
from what I understand,

07:34.579 --> 07:38.323
your drainpipe was sticking out,
he was trying to fiX it,

07:38.875 --> 07:40.332
but you broke it.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.497
That's my balcony, my house.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.797
City Hall asked us
to fix all building violations.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.712
Your drainpipe is illegal.
He's only doing his job.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.710
That's no reason to insult me.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.428
Of course not.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.923
He thinks he's a hotshot.
He's not!

07:55.183 --> 07:57.550
I'm warning you,
he'd better apologize,

07:58.061 --> 08:00.644
or I'll sue him and your company.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.809
No need for that, Mr. Tony.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.107
Let me take care of this.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.484
I'll get your drain fiXed.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.569
No one fiXes anything.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.114
We're in their neighborhood.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.616
We can't talk to them like that.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.365
We have to put up with them.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.330
He wants you to apologize.

08:29.384 --> 08:32.717
He's waiting.
Do it, then fix his drainpipe.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.381
Yes.

08:39.309 --> 08:40.926
When will you finish?

08:41.395 --> 08:43.763
In two months.
That's why I hired Yasser.

08:44.357 --> 08:45.347
He gets the job done.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.516
He has a tough job.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.856
He's a bit moody.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.856
He gets carried away,
but he's harmless.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.234
You know, life has become difficult.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.156
People are angry.

08:59.039 --> 09:03.249
That's why we should put things
in perspective.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.043
Tell Mr. Tony that Yasser is sorry.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.175
And he presents his apologies.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.883
Thank you. You shouldn't have.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.099
It's nothing.
I hope he likes chocolate.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.348
A boy or a girl?

09:24.814 --> 09:25.804
Girl.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.315
When is she due?

09:28.693 --> 09:29.900
End of summer.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.735
September 28.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.696
Perfect. The weather will be cooler.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.202
- How much steel for this wall?
- Half a ton.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.366
Why?

09:41.623 --> 09:43.114
It's 3 meters thick.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.410
Come in.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.085
Mr. Tony, please wait.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.598
- I thought we'd solved this.
- No, we didn't.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.470
You spoke to my wife.
Did you expect she'd finesse me?

10:05.730 --> 10:07.016
I looked for you.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.764
The chocolate wasn't his idea.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.937
It came from all of us.
So what?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.901
Don't try to walk all over us!

10:13.154 --> 10:14.019
What do you mean?

10:14.280 --> 10:17.523
I asked for an apology!
He should have done it!

10:17.826 --> 10:21.365
Mr. Tony, some people find it
difficult to apologize.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.364
It doesn't mean
they don't recognize their errors.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.205
<i>Because of their corrupt leadership,</i>

10:32.757 --> 10:38.048
<i>the Palestinians have become
despised everywhere.</i>

10:40.181 --> 10:43.424
<i>Let them find another land</i>

10:43.685 --> 10:45.051
<i>to live in,</i>

10:45.311 --> 10:47.052
<i>other than Lebanon.</i>

10:47.689 --> 10:50.102
<i>Let them establish their own state,</i>

10:50.525 --> 10:53.233
<i>let them rule themselves,</i>

10:53.486 --> 10:56.604
<i>let them scatter in the Arab world.</i>

10:57.198 --> 10:59.565
<i>They may unite with Jordan,</i>

10:59.951 --> 11:02.068
<i>they may run to Iran,</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:03.903
<i>as long as</i>

11:04.622 --> 11:06.614
<i>they don't stay here.</i>

11:14.632 --> 11:15.338
How's work?

11:15.592 --> 11:19.211
Great. Norway donated a generator
for the school.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.962
In Norway, if you choose to live
1,000 miles away,

11:22.223 --> 11:26.137
the State provides you
power, water, internet, gas.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.351
We're a long way from Norway.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.684
It's getting complicated.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.566
He's not willing to let go.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.691
If he files a complaint,
I'll have to report it.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.859
I don't want to,
and you know why.

11:40.825 --> 11:41.986
What complaint?

11:42.327 --> 11:43.534
What happened?

11:44.245 --> 11:47.738
A misunderstanding with a tenant.
Nothing serious.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.871
If the cops intervene,
it'll be a problem.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.664
I want to resolve this.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.754
What's going on?

11:56.007 --> 11:57.418
It's about a gutter.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.759
Your husband goes to fix it,
the tenant breaks it.

12:01.012 --> 12:04.301
He gets water on your husband,
who calls him a fucking prick.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.094
The tenant wants an apology.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.885
Which came first:
the gutter or the prick?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.137
That's not the issue right now.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.975
My husband is fair.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.649
Your husband got carried away.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.235
I want to resolve this thing.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.153
I want you to apologize.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.272
You hear me?

12:23.409 --> 12:24.570
Listen, Yasser,

12:25.286 --> 12:27.778
we're asked to rebuild
the refugee camp up north.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.325
It's two years of work.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.284
Let's not screw this up
over a few stupid words.

12:33.670 --> 12:37.209
Because that's what they are,
just stupid words.

12:42.804 --> 12:45.342
Tomorrow morning. We go together.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.884
Tomorrow is Sunday.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.803
He's open on Sunday.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.402
He's going out on a limb for you.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.651
What shall I do, bend over?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.995
Show some appreciation.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.615
I'm nobody's servant!

13:12.875 --> 13:14.366
That's selfish.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.751
The world's not plotting against you.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.587
We are targeted.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.252
- Who's we?
- Me, you, all of us.

13:21.509 --> 13:23.751
We're the niggers of the Arab world.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.421
Did your boss plot against you?

13:26.681 --> 13:28.718
Did Norway plot against you?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.100
Norway?
Did you meet someone?

13:31.769 --> 13:32.555
You wish.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.429
Well, move to fucking Norway.
I'm not stopping you.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.431
If I go, I take you with me.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.476
You insulted a man.
Now fix it.

13:45.533 --> 13:48.071
You love your work, you're happy.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.028
Don't let this spoil everything.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.546
<i>In your name,</i>

14:01.382 --> 14:04.170
<i>in the name of the people
of Tarshish and Antura,</i>

14:04.427 --> 14:06.419
<i>the people of Damour,</i>

14:07.055 --> 14:08.717
<i>ofAshieh...</i>

14:11.351 --> 14:12.637
Hello, Mr. Tony.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.765
Can you come outside, please?

14:17.398 --> 14:18.479
What for?

14:18.733 --> 14:20.816
There's been a misunderstanding,

14:21.319 --> 14:23.777
I'd like us to turn the page.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.030
You keep saying misunderstanding.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.870
<i>So they don't end up
like the Palestinian refugee,</i>

14:34.123 --> 14:38.117
<i>wandering the world,
ruining everything in his path,</i>

14:38.669 --> 14:42.754
<i>drinking from our wells
then spitting in it...</i>

14:43.758 --> 14:45.465
I'm asking you personally.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.923
He's waiting for you.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.296
<i>Why do we pursue</i>

14:50.556 --> 14:52.422
<i>our struggle?</i>

14:53.101 --> 14:55.559
<i>Why do we still need
the Lebanese resistance</i>

14:55.978 --> 14:58.595
<i>and the Christian Party?</i>

14:58.981 --> 15:02.224
<i>Why do we see casualties every day?</i>

15:02.568 --> 15:05.311
<i>Why are we being forced</i>

15:05.571 --> 15:06.857
<i>to put order in the house?</i>

15:08.157 --> 15:09.944
<i>And to put a stop</i>

15:10.201 --> 15:11.408
<i>to the abuse?</i>

15:11.911 --> 15:16.246
<i>Because two-thirds of this country
are still occupied.</i>

15:16.624 --> 15:19.082
<i>Two-thirds of our villagers</i>

15:19.335 --> 15:20.542
<i>are now refugees.</i>

15:28.511 --> 15:30.719
Mr. Tony wants to turn the page.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.713
He wants to hear it from you.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.815
You know what?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.980
You people are lousy bastards.

15:46.446 --> 15:51.282
Otherwise, you would've apologiZed.
That explains your bad reputation.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.741
As the Jews say,

15:54.495 --> 15:57.533
"Palestinians never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity."

16:03.254 --> 16:05.712
Yasser, what's wrong with you?

16:06.674 --> 16:08.085
You want to get fired?

16:08.759 --> 16:09.875
I'll do it.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.343
I swear.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.303
I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out!

16:35.119 --> 16:37.202
Two broken ribs. What happened?

16:37.455 --> 16:38.866
Someone hit him,

16:39.123 --> 16:40.864
about a stupid gutter.

16:41.125 --> 16:41.990
Breathe in.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.955
We're looking for that animal.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.796
- When we catch him...
- Not now, Eli.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.541
Don't lift anything for 8 weeks.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.919
Shall I put you on sick leave?

16:56.098 --> 16:58.715
Keep the ice pack on,
and get some rest.

16:58.976 --> 16:59.932
Get well.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.016
A Christian suing a Palestinian?

17:04.272 --> 17:06.185
No lawyer will take this case.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.479
No one would dare.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.523
I don't need a lawyer.
I know I'm right.

17:11.781 --> 17:12.988
No, you're not.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.277
You're not right at all.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.446
What you said is unacceptable.
That's how wars start.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.410
Dad, are you saying he's right?

17:19.664 --> 17:20.700
I'm saying you're wrong.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.450
He just wanted to fix your gutter,
but you humiliated him.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.451
You're blaming me for a gutter?

17:26.712 --> 17:29.750
They fucked up this country,
and you blame me for a gutter?

17:31.759 --> 17:33.796
Tell me why can't you go in there?

17:34.053 --> 17:34.839
That's how it is.

17:35.096 --> 17:37.884
We aren't authorized
to enter Palestinian camps.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.551
What authority do you have?

17:39.809 --> 17:40.799
It's political.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.847
How do you get him out?

17:43.104 --> 17:44.311
You bait him?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.097
He must be in there hiding.

17:47.358 --> 17:49.020
Then he'll be deemed a fugitive,

17:49.277 --> 17:51.439
and an arrest warrant will be issued.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.983
You said you can't arrest him!
What a joke!

17:54.240 --> 17:56.732
It's the hideout of every convict.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.575
Please, let me finish.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.694
If it were me, I'd be in jail.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.529
But him,

18:02.790 --> 18:03.997
we arrest him by mail.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.832
Because he's Palestinian!

18:06.085 --> 18:07.292
This is bullshit!

18:14.135 --> 18:16.047
You insulted the police.

18:16.304 --> 18:18.170
No, I insulted the situation.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.639
- "I wish Ariel Sharon..."
- What's the problem?

18:20.891 --> 18:21.881
How could you?

18:22.143 --> 18:23.930
To a Palestinian?

18:24.186 --> 18:26.428
- You don't understand.
- I don't?

18:26.689 --> 18:32.481
It's normal for you, but not for me.
You think it's a perfect world?

18:32.737 --> 18:34.273
Is it because of the baby?

18:34.530 --> 18:36.112
I don't want her to suffer.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.230
Me neither.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.575
But we're stuck,
and you don't want to change.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.842
Hello.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.308
I'll be gone for a few days.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.897
Continue working as usual.

19:13.027 --> 19:16.737
Close the sewers on Fassouh Street
and level out the concrete.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.652
No problem.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.487
How are you, boss?

19:26.707 --> 19:28.243
He asked for it.

19:41.764 --> 19:42.800
Here.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.720
Can you feel it?

19:48.479 --> 19:50.812
You think she knows what's going on?

19:52.566 --> 19:53.682
I don't know.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.731
I think she knows everything.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.356
She knows when we're happy,

20:00.616 --> 20:01.982
when we're sad,

20:03.244 --> 20:04.701
when we're angry.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.125
You think she can hear us?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.167
I think so.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.801
Right, Streeda?

20:43.033 --> 20:44.399
Can I help you?

20:45.536 --> 20:47.198
I'm Yasser Salameh.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.408
I'm turning myself in.

20:59.425 --> 21:00.711
Drop your case.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.002
He gets out of jail
and everything will be fine.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.472
- You still defend him.
- Because he's a decent man.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.595
He doesn't deserve this.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.681
He doesn't belong in jail.

21:12.521 --> 21:16.731
We don't solve this thing
by pretending we love each other.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.520
That's not how it works.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.769
It could.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.151
I'm no Jesus Christ
who'll turn the other cheek.

21:42.927 --> 21:46.045
Case Number 23:
Tony Hanna vs Yasser Salameh.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.686
Are you the plaintiff,
Tony George Hanna, Lebanese,

21:54.939 --> 21:56.805
born October 7, 1970?

21:57.066 --> 21:57.772
Yes.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.184
You reside in Beirut.

22:00.444 --> 22:01.025
Yes.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.359
Bring in the accused.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.376
Are you Yasser Abdallah Salameh,

22:26.637 --> 22:28.754
born June 16, 1955 in Palestine?

22:29.014 --> 22:29.629
Yes.

22:29.890 --> 22:32.382
- What ID do you have?
- A laissez-passer.

22:32.643 --> 22:33.554
Where do you reside?

22:33.936 --> 22:35.017
St. Eli Refugee Camp.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.598
You don't want an attorney?

22:37.147 --> 22:38.058
No.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.852
Mr. Tony,

22:40.526 --> 22:44.941
you claim that on July 2,
Mr. Salameh insulted you.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.280
A week later, at 8:30 AM,

22:47.533 --> 22:50.241
he assaulted you at your garage
and broke two ribs.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.075
Yes.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.911
You're suing for physical
and moral damages.

22:54.164 --> 22:54.745
Yes.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.865
How much are you claiming?

22:57.877 --> 23:00.745
- What do you mean?
- What's the amount you want?

23:01.005 --> 23:02.086
The court will say.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.917
You're also asking for "acknowledgment".

23:07.177 --> 23:08.133
Can you explain?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.299
I want him to acknowledge
that he erred.

23:10.556 --> 23:11.922
- And I...
- The court decides.

23:12.182 --> 23:15.300
I want him to say he's sorry,
hear it out of his mouth.

23:16.854 --> 23:17.935
Why don't you have a lawyer?

23:18.188 --> 23:19.395
Because I'm right.

23:20.149 --> 23:22.562
Just because you say so
doesn't mean it's true.

23:23.819 --> 23:24.809
Mr. Yasser,

23:25.529 --> 23:27.691
how do you plead?

23:29.742 --> 23:32.860
Guilty, not guilty,
guilty with an explanation?

23:33.579 --> 23:34.285
Guilty.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.700
Your Honor, can I talk to Mr. Yasser?

23:36.957 --> 23:38.164
Are you his lawyer?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.157
His employer.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.375
- Please sit.
- He doesn't know the laws.

23:41.629 --> 23:42.790
I said sit down.

23:45.007 --> 23:45.918
Mr. Yasser,

23:46.175 --> 23:48.838
by pleading guilty,
you consent to the crime.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.092
Yes.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.432
I was watering my plants as usual,

23:55.809 --> 23:58.927
I didn't notice he was under my balcony.
Suddenly I heard...

23:59.188 --> 24:03.273
Why didn't you look down
to check if anyone was underneath?

24:03.609 --> 24:06.522
Didn't you know
your installation was illegal?

24:06.779 --> 24:08.691
- Every flat is like that.
- Answer me.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.193
Did you know it was illegal?

24:11.450 --> 24:12.691
No, I didn't.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.534
When the company
informed you that it was,

24:14.787 --> 24:17.450
and sent someone to fix it,
why did you refuse?

24:17.706 --> 24:21.074
I didn't want workers in our home.
My pregnant wife was alone.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.296
Did you have other problems
in your home?

24:26.674 --> 24:29.542
- A wiring problem two months ago.
- What did you do?

24:29.802 --> 24:32.636
I called an electrician.
It was the fuse box.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.800
Is the fuse box in your apartment?

24:35.057 --> 24:35.797
Yes.

24:36.058 --> 24:38.721
So the electrician went
inside your apartment.

24:39.061 --> 24:39.801
Correct.

24:40.062 --> 24:42.475
When he came in, was your wife alone?

24:43.899 --> 24:45.106
Yes, but we...

24:45.359 --> 24:46.770
Thank you, Mr. Tony.

24:48.612 --> 24:49.853
Mr. Yasser,

24:50.114 --> 24:53.278
you've been renovating buildings there
for five weeks now.

24:53.534 --> 24:54.115
Yes.

24:54.368 --> 24:56.155
- How do residents treat you?
- Well.

24:56.578 --> 25:01.494
You know that in this town,
every area has its own sensibilities,

25:01.750 --> 25:03.912
political, religious.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.331
Have you taken this into account?

25:06.588 --> 25:07.874
- Yes.
- How?

25:08.757 --> 25:12.000
I asked my workers
to pray in a car park,

25:13.220 --> 25:14.586
to offend no one.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.931
The fight with Mr. Tony
is the first one you've had.

25:18.183 --> 25:18.798
Yes.

25:19.601 --> 25:21.217
So why

25:21.895 --> 25:25.138
after five weeks of friendly relations,

25:25.399 --> 25:28.312
did you call Mr. Hanna
a "fucking prick"?

25:30.738 --> 25:32.354
He spilled dirty water on me.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.986
He says it was an accident.
How do you answer to this?

25:36.243 --> 25:39.281
I've done nothing wrong
eXcept do my job.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.904
Why didn't you apologize?

25:41.165 --> 25:42.872
He gave you ample time to do it.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.122
I didn't feel I owed him an apology.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.204
So on July 9,

25:49.465 --> 25:52.629
you go to his garage and punch him.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.381
This is premeditated assault.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.513
I was going to apologize.

25:58.766 --> 26:00.223
What changed your mind?

26:01.310 --> 26:03.393
Please answer, what stopped you?

26:04.396 --> 26:06.479
I already said I was guilty.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.975
I need to know
what pushed you to hit him.

26:10.611 --> 26:11.943
The report doesn't say why.

26:15.616 --> 26:17.107
He said things.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.107
Like what?

26:26.210 --> 26:28.998
You're doing yourself no favor
by remaining silent.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.371
The allegations against you are serious.

26:39.223 --> 26:41.135
What pushed him to hit you?

26:41.391 --> 26:42.552
He was asked first.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.517
I'm addressing you now.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.474
If my words were bad,
then let him repeat them.

26:47.731 --> 26:48.767
What did you say?

26:49.233 --> 26:50.644
He had no right to hit me.

26:50.984 --> 26:53.476
You must have said something
that pushed him.

26:54.154 --> 26:57.192
If you won't say it,
you admit he didn't deserve it.

26:59.993 --> 27:03.031
I don't believe it all started
over a gutter.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.248
This is the last time I will ask.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.625
Mr. Tony.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.328
Mr. Yasser.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.002
Very well.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.961
This court finds

27:17.386 --> 27:20.754
all the evidence presented
is inconclusive.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.051
Inconclusive?
What about my injuries?

27:23.308 --> 27:24.515
Do not interrupt me.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.009
You can't lump us together.

27:26.270 --> 27:28.011
Don't tell me what I can't do!

27:28.272 --> 27:30.309
Nothing justifies physical assault!

27:30.566 --> 27:31.727
Says who?

27:33.485 --> 27:36.853
Article 554 of the penal code:

27:37.114 --> 27:40.232
"Aggravated assault is defined
by serious bodily injury..."

27:40.492 --> 27:41.733
I know what the law says.

27:41.994 --> 27:46.329
"... and carries a sentence of 6 months
and a fine of up to 50,000 pounds."

27:46.582 --> 27:47.663
Mr. Tony, please.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.828
- "In case it leads to illness...
- Mr. Tony!

27:50.085 --> 27:52.702
- You've crossed the line.
- This is the law.

27:52.963 --> 27:56.081
You broke the law
by having an illegal pipe

27:56.341 --> 27:58.298
and breaking it after he fixed it.

27:58.552 --> 27:59.633
Case dismissed!

28:01.180 --> 28:03.513
- Not fair, Your Honor!
- You may go, Mr. Yasser.

28:03.765 --> 28:06.553
You're biased.
You're acquitting a criminal.

28:06.810 --> 28:07.766
Leave the courtroom.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.886
Not before I get a fair trial.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.139
Get out or I'll have you arrested.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.480
For what?

28:13.734 --> 28:14.520
Get him out!

28:17.237 --> 28:20.526
You're a corrupt judge and a fraud.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.447
I will sue you.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.691
You're hurting him!

28:23.952 --> 28:25.818
I'll have you barred from this court

28:26.079 --> 28:27.786
and from every other court!

28:29.958 --> 28:31.574
It pays to be Palestinian!

28:32.044 --> 28:33.455
It pays to be Palestinian!

29:24.179 --> 29:25.920
You weren't expecting it.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.928
Since neither of you told the judge
the whole truth.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.223
The truth is I hit someone
because of an insult.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.598
If it were that simple,
you'd still be in jail.

29:37.234 --> 29:40.944
The judge was biased.
It's just that it was in my favor.

29:41.571 --> 29:45.235
No, he understood
it was about more than a gutter.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.571
How could you say that to the judge?

29:51.832 --> 29:53.164
He was a biased judge.

29:53.417 --> 29:54.953
Appeal, but don't insult judges.

29:55.419 --> 29:57.126
They're all in cahoots.

29:58.130 --> 30:00.372
The Palestinian was gloating
the whole time.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.497
I didn't see that.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.124
You were sitting in the back.

30:03.385 --> 30:05.297
He didn't tell the judge what you said!

30:05.554 --> 30:08.217
Because he had the verdict
in the pocket.

30:09.725 --> 30:12.308
People who get humiliated
end up hating themselves.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.093
What are you saying?

30:14.771 --> 30:17.013
Tomorrow we get into an argument,

30:17.274 --> 30:18.856
I beat the shit out of you,

30:19.109 --> 30:20.441
I smash your brain,

30:20.694 --> 30:22.310
but it's OK since I hate myself?

30:22.571 --> 30:24.654
- I dare you.
- Manner of speaking.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.865
Never talk to me like this!
I don't care how bad you feel.

30:28.118 --> 30:29.700
Manner of speaking!

30:31.455 --> 30:33.447
Boss, screw the courts.

30:33.707 --> 30:36.120
They bribed him.
Bunch of pricks!

30:36.376 --> 30:38.663
There's a witch-hunt against Christians.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.128
You weren't even born yet.
So shut up.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.906
Take photos of this place
from different angles.

31:17.167 --> 31:20.660
Send them to the Mayor
in a golden frame.

31:20.921 --> 31:22.878
For the press,

31:23.131 --> 31:25.293
"Ibrahim Nassar Construction Company

31:25.550 --> 31:29.169
"serves this community

31:29.429 --> 31:33.218
"by removing violations
and improving infrastructures, etc."

31:33.475 --> 31:34.761
Yes, Mr. Deputy.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.180
Good work, Talal.
It's looking fine.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.518
Thank you.

31:38.772 --> 31:39.933
But,

31:41.274 --> 31:43.106
why are we using Italian paint?

31:43.360 --> 31:45.522
The local brand peels off when it rains.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.862
The Italian has a 10-year warranty.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.197
Mix it.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.526
It will void the warranty, sir.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.293
Who is he?

32:10.929 --> 32:12.386
The foreman.

32:14.391 --> 32:15.427
Palestinian.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.592
I know, it's illegal.

32:20.147 --> 32:22.605
You know where I stand on this issue.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.688
I'm with their cause.
I share their grief.

32:26.153 --> 32:27.143
I know.

32:27.988 --> 32:29.604
But not at the firm's expenses.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.812
Court date is set for August 3.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.183
Judge Colette Mansur will preside.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.980
I hope the court's AC is working.

35:57.989 --> 36:02.825
The doctor is preparing his report
on the Hannas and their daughter.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.528
- He'll have to state...
- No, "to prove".

36:05.789 --> 36:09.499
To prove that their complications
are the consequence...

36:09.751 --> 36:12.038
No, the "direct consequence"
of the assault.

36:12.295 --> 36:15.413
Choose your words carefully,
this is the appeal phase.

36:15.674 --> 36:17.666
Mr. Tony Hanna is here.

36:21.012 --> 36:21.843
Hello.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.182
We heard about your day in court.

36:27.435 --> 36:30.428
- What you told the judge was ballsy.
- I got carried away.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.272
How could you not?
An injustice was committed.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.150
But do me a favor,

36:36.486 --> 36:39.103
never go to court
without a lawyer.

36:39.364 --> 36:41.230
I didn't want to sue, counselor.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.323
All I wanted was an apology.

36:43.576 --> 36:44.862
And he refused.

36:45.245 --> 36:48.955
You gave him ample time to apologize,
and he beat you up.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.493
That's unacceptable.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.414
He beat up a Lebanese citizen.
We cannot accept that.

36:55.839 --> 36:57.250
He pleaded guilty.

36:57.507 --> 37:01.126
To get an acquittal.
Those people are sneaky, deceitful.

37:01.678 --> 37:04.546
They know how to turn the tables round.

37:04.806 --> 37:07.093
Aggressors paint themselves as victims,

37:07.350 --> 37:09.512
and you know who they learn it from.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.637
I did certain things
that I shouldn't have.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.896
I poured water on him.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.940
I went to my garage,

37:17.235 --> 37:18.897
I carried heavy things...

37:19.154 --> 37:20.144
Mr. Tony,

37:20.405 --> 37:22.943
you came to me, right?

37:23.199 --> 37:24.110
Yes.

37:24.367 --> 37:27.986
So please, let's focus on that.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.571
I want a fair trial, counselor.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.664
I don't want to win by sympathy.

37:33.418 --> 37:36.832
Do you think Wajdy Webb wins cases
by sympathy?

37:38.423 --> 37:39.459
Jessica.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.291
We're suing for pain and suffering,

37:42.552 --> 37:45.010
yours, your wife's, and your daughter's.

37:45.263 --> 37:49.132
We'll ask for $80,000 in damages
and $40,000

37:49.392 --> 37:51.224
for moral damages.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.306
I don't care about money.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.104
What do you care about?

37:55.356 --> 37:56.563
When we're done with him,

37:56.816 --> 38:00.059
I want him to say
I'm 100 times worse than Ariel Sharon.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.694
Let me ask you a question,

38:02.947 --> 38:06.531
why did you say, "I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out?"

38:06.785 --> 38:07.775
What's the big deal?

38:08.036 --> 38:10.870
If the judge asks you,
how will you answer?

38:11.706 --> 38:13.072
It felt right to say it.

38:13.333 --> 38:17.247
That's not a good argument.
Those words are loaded, Mr. Tony.

38:17.504 --> 38:20.338
What you said is very compleX.

38:20.590 --> 38:21.706
I don't understand.

38:21.966 --> 38:25.459
The Palestinian cause is
a whole different ball game.

38:25.720 --> 38:30.135
There's the UN, the NGOs,
the humanitarian organizations...

38:30.391 --> 38:32.178
Everyone roots for the Palestinians.

38:32.477 --> 38:33.888
And don't forget,

38:34.145 --> 38:35.977
there are those who hate us.

38:36.231 --> 38:38.393
The Left, the liberals.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.523
By the way, many are Christians.

38:40.777 --> 38:45.818
They'd all be willing to skydive
just to defend Yasser Salameh.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.236
It's trendy to defend those people.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.201
So even if your opponent
wants to settle out of court,

38:51.454 --> 38:52.740
they may force him not to.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.989
My daughter is on life support,

38:55.250 --> 38:58.414
She can't breathe on her own.
We don't know if she'll make it.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.411
My wife is also...

39:01.005 --> 39:04.373
I want you to think carefully
about what you said.

39:04.634 --> 39:07.752
That's what they'll focus on in court,

39:08.012 --> 39:11.972
not who spilled water, who beat whom,
or who's the fucking prick,

39:12.225 --> 39:15.559
but why you said, "I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out."

40:01.316 --> 40:03.353
Mr. Yasser, what I'd like to know

40:04.110 --> 40:07.194
is why you didn't tell the judge
what your opponent said?

40:07.614 --> 40:09.196
My husband isn't a snitch.

40:09.657 --> 40:12.149
No one will judge your integrity
in a court.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.776
I called him a fucking prick.

40:14.037 --> 40:17.155
You can't compare prick
with Sharon wiping you all out.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.747
He said, "I wish".

40:19.000 --> 40:20.036
What's the difference?

40:20.293 --> 40:24.037
He could have said: wiped you out,
beat you up, or loved you.

40:24.297 --> 40:25.629
They're just words.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.756
So why were you upset?

40:29.886 --> 40:32.048
Those words change everything.

40:32.305 --> 40:34.513
They insult your nationality
and identity.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.632
It could be considered a hate crime.

40:36.893 --> 40:39.101
Everyone hates and insults everybody.

40:39.604 --> 40:43.143
Insulting someone's identity
is punishable by law.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.935
It means you can sue him.

40:45.193 --> 40:46.058
But I hit him.

40:46.319 --> 40:47.730
Because of what he said.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.775
Plus, he asked you to apologize.
You went to do that.

40:51.032 --> 40:52.364
He's got a problem with me.

40:59.958 --> 41:02.826
According to Article 228
of the penal code,

41:03.086 --> 41:06.545
even if a perpetrator exceeds
the bounds of self-defense,

41:06.798 --> 41:09.962
he may be acquitted
if he acted in extreme distress

41:10.385 --> 41:12.547
that hampered
his judgment and self-control.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.841
Forget my distress.

41:15.515 --> 41:17.222
His child is fighting for her life.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.808
That's why you need a lawyer.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.391
I can't afford you.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.472
Your opponent is appealing

41:25.733 --> 41:29.443
for his and his wife's
health complications.

41:29.696 --> 41:33.315
If his baby dies,
that's involuntary manslaughter.

41:33.574 --> 41:34.735
We're looking at ten years.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.369
You can manage this situation
or let it manage you.

41:38.621 --> 41:41.864
Either way, you have little time.
Please think about it.

41:48.131 --> 41:49.997
Why are you doing this?

41:52.218 --> 41:54.961
Because you people
are often deprived of your rights.

42:30.131 --> 42:31.292
Not now.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.505
I'm sorry for everything.

42:32.759 --> 42:34.091
Enough of your bullshit.

42:34.343 --> 42:37.836
We were fine
until you barged into our neighborhood.

42:38.097 --> 42:39.929
- I understand.
- You understand nothing!

42:40.183 --> 42:42.175
We want to cover your hospital bills,

42:42.435 --> 42:44.768
and do repairs to your home,
anything we can help...

42:45.146 --> 42:46.637
And how will that save my daughter?

42:46.898 --> 42:47.934
How?

42:48.191 --> 42:51.059
You think you can buy us with flowers

42:51.319 --> 42:52.901
and a boX of chocolate?

42:53.154 --> 42:54.440
Of course not.

42:54.781 --> 42:58.115
Tell your fucking deputy
we're not for sale.

43:00.411 --> 43:02.198
I want those people out of my life.

43:02.455 --> 43:05.243
Wajdy Webb has the case. We'll win.

43:05.500 --> 43:06.911
I don't care who wins.

43:07.168 --> 43:10.457
You let a stupid incident
take hold of you.

43:10.713 --> 43:12.579
I won't drop the case. Never.

43:12.840 --> 43:16.459
You go to court, you win,
the guy gets life. Then what?

43:16.719 --> 43:18.836
- That's a lot already.
- And your baby?

43:19.097 --> 43:21.339
- What about her?
- Did you ask her what she wants?

43:21.599 --> 43:22.635
It's for her.

43:22.892 --> 43:25.555
I'm doing this for you, for the family.

43:25.812 --> 43:27.974
You're doing it for yourself!

43:28.648 --> 43:31.186
You'll burn everything
but not turn the page!

43:31.442 --> 43:34.606
You know what?
I hope you get what you want.

43:39.534 --> 43:41.696
American University of Cairo.

43:41.953 --> 43:43.865
Master's degree in civil engineering.

43:44.122 --> 43:48.036
Worked for Bechtel
in Kuwait and in Dubai.

43:48.292 --> 43:50.249
Moved to Beirut in 1982.

43:50.503 --> 43:53.291
Met his Lebanese wife there.

43:53.673 --> 43:54.629
A Christian.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.293
I'm not surprised.

43:58.136 --> 44:00.503
Sir, this is the motion
filed by the defense.

44:17.363 --> 44:19.901
Traumatic pneumothorax occurs

44:20.324 --> 44:23.783
when the pleural cavity
surrounding the lungs is punctured.

44:24.036 --> 44:26.198
It was literally skewered

44:26.455 --> 44:28.412
by the fractured rib,

44:28.666 --> 44:30.248
resulting in acute pain,

44:30.501 --> 44:32.663
labored breathing,
and a raised heart rate.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.206
Dr. Badran,

44:35.006 --> 44:36.417
is it serious?

44:37.133 --> 44:40.092
The pressure on a lung
can damage it

44:40.511 --> 44:42.127
and displace other organs.

44:42.388 --> 44:45.597
Can you describe
what Mrs. Hanna went through?

44:46.100 --> 44:47.682
She was hospitalized

44:48.144 --> 44:50.602
for a preterm delivery
by caesarian section.

44:51.856 --> 44:54.849
If she hadn't arrive in time,
she might have lost the baby.

44:55.109 --> 44:56.691
What caused this?

44:57.195 --> 44:58.026
It was the...

44:58.571 --> 44:59.982
It was the direct result

45:00.239 --> 45:04.449
of the emotional shock
from seeing her husband unconscious.

45:04.869 --> 45:07.987
Can an emotional shock
lead to a miscarriage?

45:08.247 --> 45:09.078
Sure.

45:09.332 --> 45:12.075
Plus she had contractions

45:12.335 --> 45:15.123
when she pulled her husband to her car.

45:16.005 --> 45:17.712
Thank you, Doctor.

45:26.557 --> 45:27.798
Dr. Khawam,

45:28.059 --> 45:30.847
had Mr. Tony followed
his doctor's advice,

45:31.103 --> 45:33.561
could the traumatic pneumothorax
have occurred?

45:33.814 --> 45:34.975
Unlikely.

45:35.233 --> 45:36.849
So he brought it upon himself.

45:37.109 --> 45:38.316
Objection, Your Honor.

45:38.569 --> 45:39.355
Mr. Tony,

45:39.612 --> 45:42.400
did you follow your doctor's advice
to get rest?

45:42.990 --> 45:46.028
I had to go to work.
I have bills to pay.

45:46.285 --> 45:47.821
We're not contesting this.

45:48.079 --> 45:51.447
Can you describe
the movements you made?

45:51.707 --> 45:56.623
I lifted a heavy battery.
It hurt, then I fell.

45:57.171 --> 46:00.835
Can those movements provoke
a traumatic pneumothorax?

46:01.092 --> 46:01.923
No doubt.

46:02.176 --> 46:05.635
Remember: the defendant's blow
caused the fracture.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.845
But not the ensuing complications.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.465
No fracture, no complications!

46:09.725 --> 46:12.012
He'd have had none
had he obeyed his doctor.

46:12.270 --> 46:13.386
Objection.

46:13.646 --> 46:15.308
Please let her finish.

46:16.399 --> 46:18.607
Mr. Tony claims the premature delivery

46:18.859 --> 46:21.442
was due to the shock
of seeing her husband,

46:21.696 --> 46:26.031
and the contractions were due
to pulling her husband to the car.

46:28.577 --> 46:30.569
These are the hospital's records.

46:30.830 --> 46:34.540
They belong to Mrs. Hanna.
They date back to 2013 and 2014.

46:35.710 --> 46:37.542
Please look at them.

46:40.006 --> 46:40.871
As you can see,

46:41.132 --> 46:44.671
Mrs. Hanna had two miscarriages,
on the 3rd and the 5th months.

46:45.761 --> 46:46.672
Dr. Khawam,

46:47.930 --> 46:50.388
can a woman
with a history of miscarriages

46:50.641 --> 46:53.600
be prone to a premature birth
with no outside factors?

46:54.103 --> 46:55.014
Yes.

46:57.648 --> 46:58.889
No further questions.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.192
- Did you have to?
- It's scientific evidence.

47:10.453 --> 47:11.569
That's not right.

47:11.829 --> 47:13.912
You're accused of a crime
you didn't commit.

47:14.165 --> 47:15.997
We're prying into private lives.

47:16.250 --> 47:18.867
We're exposing them in public.
It's not right!

47:19.128 --> 47:22.371
What is right?
They do it to us, we do it to them.

47:22.631 --> 47:24.247
I don't want this!

47:29.680 --> 47:32.093
As an engineer,
he was very eXperienced.

47:32.350 --> 47:35.639
But since he's Palestinian,
he's not allowed to practice here.

47:35.895 --> 47:37.636
So I hired him as a foreman.

47:37.897 --> 47:39.308
In charge of how many workers?

47:39.565 --> 47:43.024
60 to 75.

47:43.611 --> 47:45.773
How would you describe
Mr. Yasser's work?

47:46.322 --> 47:47.563
He was thorough.

47:47.823 --> 47:49.815
He always finished on time.

47:50.076 --> 47:54.070
We called him the rooster,
because he always showed up early

47:54.330 --> 47:56.492
and went home
after the last prayer call.

47:57.249 --> 48:00.162
So the company was happy
with his work.

48:00.419 --> 48:01.455
Yes.

48:02.463 --> 48:04.796
How long was he supposed
to work for you?

48:05.049 --> 48:07.211
- 18 months.
- How long did he last?

48:07.468 --> 48:08.299
6 weeks.

48:08.552 --> 48:09.918
6 weeks?

48:10.262 --> 48:11.127
What happened?

48:11.389 --> 48:11.970
One day,

48:12.223 --> 48:15.933
he cut some cables
that were left on the street.

48:16.268 --> 48:20.808
Another time, I showed up,
and found a crane, a Liebherr.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.772
He ordered it without asking.

48:23.025 --> 48:24.766
It cost us $800 per day,

48:25.027 --> 48:27.440
because he didn't want
to use the other crane.

48:27.696 --> 48:30.279
One day, he exploded like a time bomb.

48:30.533 --> 48:33.822
He grabbed a sledgehammer
and tore down the faÃ§ade.

48:35.663 --> 48:36.619
What's new?

48:36.872 --> 48:39.910
A guy from the Christian Party
is suing a Palestinian.

48:40.251 --> 48:43.961
<i>He was not only embarrassing
but also dangerous.</i>

48:44.338 --> 48:47.672
So finally I said that was it,
and I fired him.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.632
Did he show any remorse?

48:50.052 --> 48:51.133
Ask him.

48:51.387 --> 48:52.969
So basically,

48:53.848 --> 48:55.680
you hire Mr. Yasser,

48:55.933 --> 48:58.266
you help him out,
and then he betrays you.

48:58.519 --> 48:59.475
Yes.

48:59.979 --> 49:01.311
I was very hurt.

49:01.897 --> 49:02.978
He was ungrateful.

49:03.482 --> 49:04.723
Ungrateful?

49:04.984 --> 49:06.941
I took a risk when I hired him.

49:07.194 --> 49:10.187
You know, when you hire a Palestinian,

49:10.448 --> 49:14.067
you get accused of trying to settle
half a million Palestinians here,

49:14.326 --> 49:16.318
and you know what that means.

49:16.829 --> 49:18.536
No, can you explain?

49:18.789 --> 49:20.371
You give Palestinians jobs here,

49:20.624 --> 49:23.287
they won't return to Palestine.

49:23.544 --> 49:27.208
The Israelis are happy,
which makes you a traitor.

49:28.674 --> 49:29.539
Thank you.

49:30.009 --> 49:31.341
No further questions.

49:32.219 --> 49:34.506
Counselor Nadine, your turn.

49:37.391 --> 49:41.852
Mr. Salah, you mentioned a pillar
that shifted,

49:42.104 --> 49:45.518
which turned Mr. Yasser
into a "time bomb".

49:46.066 --> 49:48.729
What would have happened
if he hadn't spotted it?

49:48.986 --> 49:50.227
It could have collapsed,

49:50.488 --> 49:52.104
causing injuries.

49:52.615 --> 49:53.355
Possibly.

49:54.033 --> 49:58.243
You also said that he rented
this thing that cost $800.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.408
- What's it called again?
- Liebherr.

50:01.957 --> 50:03.414
What's a Liebherr?

50:04.418 --> 50:07.035
- A big German crane.
- Is it a good crane?

50:07.296 --> 50:08.503
It's German.

50:08.797 --> 50:10.834
Why didn't he use the other crane?

50:11.091 --> 50:11.831
It's Chinese.

50:12.092 --> 50:14.800
He claims
everything made in China is crap.

50:15.554 --> 50:18.592
You had about 75 foreign workers.

50:18.849 --> 50:19.839
Yes.

50:20.100 --> 50:22.592
Normally, foreign workers get
no social security,

50:22.853 --> 50:25.971
no health insurance,
no work benefits, etc.

50:26.690 --> 50:28.226
No company gives that.

50:28.484 --> 50:30.601
How come your workers got all that?

50:30.945 --> 50:31.981
He came up with a plan

50:32.238 --> 50:35.527
where the workers
would recycle scrap metal,

50:35.783 --> 50:38.321
then sell it back to the company.

50:38.577 --> 50:40.785
In exchange,
they got insurance coverage.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.825
In the end, your company...

50:43.082 --> 50:47.326
So because of his love
of perfection and compassion,

50:47.586 --> 50:48.827
aggression is justified?

50:49.088 --> 50:51.626
Mr. Yasser is not aggressive by nature.

50:51.882 --> 50:52.668
Nature?

50:52.925 --> 50:55.212
Are we debating nature here?

50:55.469 --> 50:57.961
So why are we debating
in a courthouse?

50:58.347 --> 51:01.306
We should be lying down on a couch
in front of a therapist.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.175
It pays better.

51:04.895 --> 51:07.228
What's neXt?
I shoot you with a gun,

51:07.481 --> 51:10.440
I open your chest,
I smash your brain on the sidewalk,

51:10.693 --> 51:12.605
I stab Marcelino Zamata siX times,

51:13.404 --> 51:15.396
but my nature is good.

51:21.537 --> 51:23.369
Order in the court!

51:24.248 --> 51:27.832
Your Honor,
when Mr. Yasser is given a task,

51:28.085 --> 51:31.954
he does it seriously and responsibly,
from start to finish,

51:32.965 --> 51:35.127
just like when he fixed
Mr. Tony's gutter...

51:35.384 --> 51:38.422
Mr. Tony Hanna is a law-abiding citizen,

51:38.679 --> 51:40.045
but deserves to get beaten up

51:40.306 --> 51:42.923
because Mr. Yasser is serious
and responsible!

51:43.183 --> 51:45.470
Counselor, let your daughter finish!

51:51.150 --> 51:52.982
Why didn't you say she's your daughter?

51:53.235 --> 51:53.975
<i>It makes no difference.</i>

51:54.236 --> 51:55.443
Of course it does.

51:55.696 --> 51:59.280
She knows your methods, your tricks.
She learned from you.

51:59.533 --> 52:00.444
Tricks?

52:00.701 --> 52:03.068
You think law is a trick?

52:03.329 --> 52:05.241
<i>Father against daughter.
A bit strange!</i>

52:05.497 --> 52:07.705
Mr. Tony, your cellphone.

52:07.958 --> 52:10.416
It's called conflict of interest.
I don't buy it.

52:10.669 --> 52:12.251
<i>I do.</i>

52:14.465 --> 52:16.081
Get off the case.

52:16.508 --> 52:20.422
Everything's a battlefield for you.
Not for me. I didn't grow up in the war.

52:20.679 --> 52:23.092
My life is not like yours.
I'm not you.

52:23.349 --> 52:25.591
Your mother would have been heartbroken.

52:27.519 --> 52:30.432
I won't drop the case.
See you in court.

52:30.689 --> 52:32.521
You're just a corporate lawyer.

52:32.775 --> 52:36.894
I'd hate to see you
lose your first case to me.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.688
Who said you'll win?

52:48.624 --> 52:50.331
<i>For the sake of your children,</i>

52:50.584 --> 52:53.292
<i>so they don't end up
living like the Palestinian refugee,</i>

52:53.545 --> 52:56.879
<i>and behaving
like the Palestinian refugee,</i>

52:58.092 --> 53:01.881
<i>wandering the world,
ruining everything in his path,</i>

53:02.638 --> 53:06.507
<i>drinking from our wells
then spitting in them...</i>

53:07.726 --> 53:11.390
That morning, Mr. Yasser
went to Mr. Tony to apologize.

53:11.647 --> 53:14.560
Once he heard that speech,
he changed his mind.

53:14.817 --> 53:16.103
I find it patriotic.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.397
For a Palestinian, it's offensive.

53:18.654 --> 53:19.360
Offensive?

53:19.613 --> 53:22.356
We often hear: "the road to Palestine
runs through Beirut".

53:22.616 --> 53:24.198
My client didn't say this phrase.

53:24.451 --> 53:25.658
Neither did my client!

53:25.911 --> 53:27.527
We hear speeches all the time.

53:27.788 --> 53:29.154
Incendiary speeches,

53:29.415 --> 53:31.998
subversive speeches,

53:32.251 --> 53:33.583
sexist speeches,

53:33.836 --> 53:36.419
I hear speeches
looking at myself in the mirror.

53:36.672 --> 53:39.881
- I can attest to that.
- Let's stay in court, counselors.

53:40.259 --> 53:41.841
I'd like to say...

53:42.094 --> 53:43.380
Your Honor,

53:43.971 --> 53:45.712
we live in the Middle East.

53:45.973 --> 53:48.636
The word "offensive" was born here.

53:48.892 --> 53:52.226
It's not up to Mr. Tony
to consider people's sensibilities.

53:52.646 --> 53:54.729
That's their problem, not his.

53:54.982 --> 53:57.895
Can you please allow
the defense to finish?

54:00.362 --> 54:04.197
I wish to reveal the words
that pushed Mr. Yasser to hit Mr. Tony.

54:04.616 --> 54:05.823
Go ahead.

54:06.702 --> 54:08.193
The words are:

54:12.791 --> 54:15.249
"I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out."

54:15.502 --> 54:16.993
Yes! He should have!

54:17.296 --> 54:18.707
Take that back!

54:23.010 --> 54:24.717
That's disgraceful!

54:29.266 --> 54:30.757
Order in the court!

54:31.560 --> 54:32.676
Mr. Tony,

54:34.021 --> 54:36.684
did you know these words violated

54:36.940 --> 54:40.024
Mr. Yasser's dignity and identity,
and are a hate crime?

54:40.277 --> 54:42.735
Hate crime?
For a humiliation?

54:42.988 --> 54:44.604
Which humiliation is this?

54:44.865 --> 54:47.983
The one in 1948? 1956?
The Six-Day War?

54:48.243 --> 54:50.109
The Yom Kippur War?
The 1982 War?

54:50.370 --> 54:52.157
They're all humiliations.

54:52.581 --> 54:54.868
My client can't be blamed
for those mishaps.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.458
The Palestinian tragedy
is not a mishap.

54:57.753 --> 55:00.291
It was not a mishap,
it was a catastrophe!

55:09.056 --> 55:10.297
Approach the bench.

55:11.892 --> 55:14.259
Get a hold of yourself!

55:14.520 --> 55:16.136
Think.

55:16.396 --> 55:18.388
You're right, I got carried away.

55:18.649 --> 55:21.483
I know you, Wajdy.
I won't wear a bulletproof vest.

55:21.735 --> 55:22.896
I'm warning you.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.379
<i>Today at the courthouse,</i>

55:47.636 --> 55:52.301
<i>members of the Christian Party
clashed with Palestinian refugees.</i>

55:52.558 --> 55:53.969
Which TV?

55:54.226 --> 55:57.936
<i>New TV. We'd like to have you
on our show.</i>

55:58.188 --> 55:59.850
<i>We can send a driver.</i>

56:00.107 --> 56:01.268
I'm at the hospital.

56:01.525 --> 56:03.812
<i>We can come to you.</i>

56:04.069 --> 56:05.605
Let me think about it.

56:06.488 --> 56:07.569
Great.

56:08.198 --> 56:10.440
Your lawyer is pretentious.
It's ridiculous.

56:10.701 --> 56:13.159
He's putting up a good fight.

56:13.412 --> 56:16.075
You don't like it
because you live in denial.

56:16.331 --> 56:17.697
You're just his puppet.

56:17.958 --> 56:20.291
He lets nothing slide
without contesting it.

56:20.544 --> 56:21.455
Really?

56:21.712 --> 56:24.921
Why did he say
the Palestinians were a catastrophe?

56:25.173 --> 56:26.038
He got carried away.

56:26.300 --> 56:27.006
I don't get it.

56:27.259 --> 56:31.048
A famous lawyer,
who defended the party's leader,

56:31.305 --> 56:33.797
decides to take on a trifling case?
For free?

56:34.057 --> 56:37.471
For you, it's a trifle.
For me, it's everything.

56:37.728 --> 56:39.435
- How so?
- It's about the truth.

56:39.688 --> 56:40.804
Which truth?

56:41.064 --> 56:44.478
You provoked and insulted this man.
You hurt yourself working.

56:45.402 --> 56:46.358
Really?

56:46.612 --> 56:49.946
I was publicly humiliated
because of both of you!

56:50.198 --> 56:51.609
Quiet!
You're upsetting her.

56:51.867 --> 56:54.075
She can't hear us, she's just moving.

56:54.328 --> 56:55.489
Really?

56:55.746 --> 56:58.580
In your womb, she heard everything
but now nothing?

57:02.169 --> 57:03.330
Mr. Tony?

57:04.338 --> 57:06.170
I work for a security firm.

57:06.423 --> 57:08.915
If you need protection, we're ready.

57:20.562 --> 57:23.976
<i>Courthouse Invasion - Webb wants
Palestinians Thrown into the Sea</i>

57:32.616 --> 57:35.609
Don't answer any questions
or any provocations.

57:35.869 --> 57:37.531
Walk straight inside.

57:47.673 --> 57:49.130
Is this a smear campaign?

57:49.383 --> 57:51.841
No, it's a tribute
to Wajdy Webb's career.

57:52.094 --> 57:55.758
- Your daughter is your opponent.
- Wajdy Webb encourages dissent.

57:56.014 --> 57:58.677
Why do you always speak
in the third person?

57:58.934 --> 57:59.799
It sounds better.

58:00.060 --> 58:03.428
Why are you suing a Palestinian
while Gaza is being bombed?

58:03.689 --> 58:05.396
Why are you here and not in Gaza?

58:05.649 --> 58:09.393
Are you doing this because you lost
the party leader's case?

58:11.613 --> 58:13.730
Thank you for coming to Beirut,
Mr. Ghandour.

58:13.991 --> 58:16.574
I know it's hard for you to travel.

58:16.827 --> 58:19.035
- You came from Amman?
- Yes.

58:19.287 --> 58:21.449
- That's where you live?
- Yes.

58:21.707 --> 58:25.166
This man was full of vigor and health.

58:25.794 --> 58:27.786
Until the day everything changed.

58:28.964 --> 58:32.378
He's been confined to a wheelchair
for 45 years.

58:33.719 --> 58:35.631
It happened in Jordan,

58:35.887 --> 58:38.220
July 1971.

58:38.473 --> 58:40.635
After months of heavy fighting,

58:40.892 --> 58:45.353
the Jordanian army dismantles the PLO
in the Palestinian camps.

58:46.523 --> 58:48.560
What was your role in that operation?

58:48.817 --> 58:49.898
I was the cook.

58:50.152 --> 58:51.359
Did you see any combat?

58:51.611 --> 58:54.445
No, I just fed the troops.

58:55.032 --> 58:57.570
Can you tell us what happened?

58:59.036 --> 59:01.073
At the end of the Civil War,

59:01.872 --> 59:03.864
after the PLO was expelled,

59:04.875 --> 59:08.289
the Palestinian refugees were in misery.

59:08.920 --> 59:11.879
We set up tents to serve them meals.

59:12.132 --> 59:13.418
Every day.

59:14.009 --> 59:15.671
One day,

59:16.136 --> 59:17.798
the line was very long,

59:18.555 --> 59:20.091
endless.

59:21.058 --> 59:22.970
The mood was very tense.

59:23.518 --> 59:26.761
A woman came forward
for her meal.

59:27.773 --> 59:30.015
While I was serving food,

59:30.525 --> 59:32.562
one of her children

59:32.819 --> 59:34.310
stole a piece of bread.

59:35.363 --> 59:36.979
I asked him to give it back,

59:37.240 --> 59:38.981
he refused.

59:39.993 --> 59:42.201
I tried to take it by force,

59:42.454 --> 59:43.865
he started screaming.

59:45.582 --> 59:48.074
Next thing I remember,

59:48.335 --> 59:49.792
a young man

59:50.045 --> 59:52.913
lunged at me
and started hitting me.

59:53.507 --> 59:55.464
I tried to defend myself,

59:55.717 --> 59:59.836
but he was full of rage.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:03.841
He hit me savagely.

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:07.097
He even struck me with a metal pot.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:08.845
I lost consciousness.

01:00:09.106 --> 01:00:11.223
When I woke up,

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.770
I couldn't move.

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:17.020
A cerebral hematoma
due to cranial trauma.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.654
What happened to that man?

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:22.116
He must have crossed the border.

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.326
When the PLO guerillas fled,

01:00:24.579 --> 01:00:27.196
the Jordanian army looked the other way.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:31.167
We wanted nothing more
than to see them go.

01:00:32.587 --> 01:00:34.123
Do you recognize this man?

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.016
Mr. Mohamed,

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:50.811
can you tell us who this person is?

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:05.193
A life crushed
by the brutality of the accused.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:08.571
What Yasser Salameh
inflicted on this man

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:10.824
shows his deeper nature,

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:14.122
and proves
that he has a history of violence.

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:17.713
Violence is his sole means
of functioning in society.

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:19.377
That's unacceptable.

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:21.250
This man is dangerous!

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:25.342
And if he walks free today,
it's because history was on his side.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:29.888
The political context prevented him
from being brought to justice.

01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:32.888
And now we're being asked
to absolve him again,

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:35.147
for the same political context:

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:38.643
the holy Palestinian cause!

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:40.861
Lock him up!

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:42.612
Silence!

01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:46.616
Stick to the case, counselor.

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:50.988
True, he didn't paralyze Tony Hanna,
but he came close.

01:01:51.249 --> 01:01:55.038
And at this very moment,
a newborn's life hangs in the balance.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:58.579
No further questions.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.425
Yours, Counsel.

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:08.760
Mr. Mohamed,

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:13.227
what you call the Jordanian Civil War
is known as Black September, right?

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:16.188
It was a civil war.
Many Palestinians live in Jordan.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.353
History remembers it
as Black September.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:21.444
The Jordanian army
hit Palestinian refugees,

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:24.188
killing more than 3,000,
mainly civilians,

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.442
and based on recognized criteria,
this is a massacre.

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:29.614
The militias were hiding
among civilians.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.578
We had no choice.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:36.166
Then, your army decided
to eradicate the PLO at any price.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:38.786
They tried to assassinate King Hussein.

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:43.132
They were a state within a state,
they launched cross-border attacks.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:44.751
They endangered the whole country.

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:47.549
When you kicked them out,
they came here.

01:02:48.848 --> 01:02:51.056
Order, or I'll throw you out!

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:54.639
Mr. Mohamed,
you say you were a cook.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:55.682
Yes.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:57.271
But you were in the army.

01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:58.639
Yes.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.016
Did you wear a uniform?

01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:02.776
Yes.

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:06.739
Yasser Salameh had no reason
to believe you weren't a soldier.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.654
I was serving them food.

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.368
The Jordanian Army
attacks a refugee camp,

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:14.204
indiscriminately kills
civilians and militants,

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.915
then decides to feed
those who survived.

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:20.457
The oppressor humiliates the oppressed
with his generosity.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:25.379
In this conteXt, Salameh saw a soldier
take a piece of bread from a child,

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.592
his blood boils,
he attacks the soldier.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:31.677
My client isn't the bloodthirsty man
you describe. No!

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:35.517
Yasser Salameh can't just stand there
while injustice happens.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:39.354
The proof is he refused
to repeat Tony Hanna's words,

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:42.066
though it would have been
in his interest.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:45.440
He didn't do it
because those words are humiliating.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:50.491
Tony Hanna's words made my client
act in extreme distress

01:03:50.744 --> 01:03:52.201
and pushed him to lash out.

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:54.327
Penal code, Article 228:

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:58.325
even if a perpetrator exceeds
the bounds of self-defense,

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:01.999
he may be acquitted
if he acted in extreme distress

01:04:02.255 --> 01:04:04.998
that hampered
his judgment and self-control.

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:17.093
Fucking prick.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.773
The workers agreed to work overtime.

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:25.776
You can inform the deputy.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:29.814
It's for you.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.776
What is it?

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.244
Open it.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:41.207
Why?

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:43.953
The deputy called me.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.082
He doesn't want to risk it.

01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:50.376
I tried to convince him.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:52.795
He doesn't want you here.

01:05:24.129 --> 01:05:27.213
- Mr. Yasser, are you a politician?
- No.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:28.876
- A member of a party?
- No.

01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:31.216
- Any organization?
- No.

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:35.588
Have you been solicited or asked
to speak on anyone's behalf?

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:36.555
No.

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:38.720
Has the PLO,

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:40.718
or Hamas, or any party

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:43.392
asked you to represent them
now or in the past?

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:44.434
No.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.933
- So you don't represent anyone.
- No.

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:51.195
Where were you
when you hit Tony Hanna?

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:53.147
In front of his garage.

01:05:53.867 --> 01:05:55.449
- Who was present?
- My boss.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:56.533
Who else?

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:57.826
No one.

01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:01.072
Any bystanders?

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:02.824
I don't recall.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.789
Did he have a bullhorn?

01:06:08.423 --> 01:06:11.257
Did Tony Hanna use a bullhorn to say,

01:06:11.509 --> 01:06:13.501
"I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out"?

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:16.045
No.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.972
Did he spray graffiti, call the press?

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:19.965
No.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:23.056
So when he said those words,
it was in private.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:23.894
Yes.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.934
Therefore, no publishing.

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:28.934
No libel, no crime.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.690
All my client did
was express a "wish".

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:34.279
He said, "I wish".

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:36.274
Is a wish a crime?

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:40.115
What's neXt?
My thoughts? My dreams?

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.790
If I dreamed I killed you, am I guilty?

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:46.333
Where do we stop?

01:06:46.586 --> 01:06:49.829
We are not judging thoughts and dreams,
but words.

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:51.671
All he said was,

01:06:51.925 --> 01:06:53.757
"I wish Sharon
had wiped you all out."

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:58.254
Are his words going to push Ariel Sharon
to wipe the Palestinians out?

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.008
Sharon doesn't need
Tony Hanna's permission.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.385
The words of my client

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:07.889
were spoken in anger in a dispute.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:10.941
Were they harsh? Yes.
But that's it.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.685
He was exercising his right

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:14.232
of freedom of speech.

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:17.986
Mr. Yasser,

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:21.198
if his words offended you,

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:22.365
go to court!

01:07:22.622 --> 01:07:24.284
That's where justice is served.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:27.124
When denied rights,
people lose faith in justice.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:29.039
Why is Tony Hanna responsible?

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.958
Blame those who are responsible.

01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:34.631
Who's the aggressor here?

01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:37.254
You, Mr. Yasser.

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:39.925
The moment you laid your hands
on my client,

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.298
you committed a crime,
you went too far.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.141
The defense points
to the Palestinians' despair,

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:51.015
as if they were the world's
only oppressed people.

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:52.062
And the Armenians?

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:55.652
The Kurds, the gays, the gypsies,
artists, street vendors?

01:07:55.905 --> 01:08:00.024
Who isn't deprived of rights?
I don't see them beat each other up.

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:03.323
Mr. Yasser,

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:07.497
just because you're a refugee,

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.867
a victim with no country,

01:08:10.128 --> 01:08:12.415
that gives you no excuse to be violent.

01:08:12.672 --> 01:08:15.460
Even if you are
the most oppressed person,

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:19.836
it doesn't make you the spokesman
of morality and justice!

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:27.176
And why all the fuss?

01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.929
Because Palestinians get wiped out?

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:32.272
Because Mr. Tony said these words?

01:08:32.524 --> 01:08:33.640
No.

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:35.733
The reason is Sharon.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:38.066
If Tony Hanna had said,

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:40.106
I wish the Eskimos,

01:08:40.366 --> 01:08:41.527
or the Smurfs,

01:08:41.783 --> 01:08:42.865
had wiped you all out,

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.111
we wouldn't be here debating!

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:47.283
Eskimos and Smurfs are not the point.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.827
The counselor is sidetracking us.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.036
Silence!

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:59.383
When a Jew does it, it's a crime,
but when an Arab kills an Arab, it's OK.

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:03.462
As long as we keep it
in the family, right?

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.510
- The Jews did worse!
- So say you!

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:08.384
You right-wing scum!
Don't talk about Palestinians!

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:09.725
You're a traitor!

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:13.014
Oh, sure!
Only Christians committed atrocities!

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:15.390
You collaborated with the Jews.

01:09:15.943 --> 01:09:19.232
With the devil too!
No apologies! We were the resistance.

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:22.273
Don't mention the resistance,
you dirty dog!

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.032
Counselor, please!

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:33.457
Dad, be careful.

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:35.747
None of your business!
Go defend him.

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:40.756
The first resistance was us.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.126
Way before you.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.002
Zionist dog!

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:12.331
This lawyer is filthy,
a Zionist, his client is a Zionist...

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.371
The prick deserves to be shot.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:20.206
Let those assholes know
if they come here,

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:21.377
this isn't Mossul,

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:22.875
this is Fassouh!

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:30.515
Do we know who was filming inside?

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:33.181
We don't know how cameras entered
the courtroom.

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:36.146
We'll tighten security.

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:40.105
Why bring the Jews into this?

01:10:40.361 --> 01:10:42.444
These were your words, not mine.

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:44.814
I'm being called
an Israeli sympathizer.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.906
You started the whole thing.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.402
- You should defend me.
<i>- What did you expect?</i>

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.991
A walk in the park?

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.830
<i>This is war.
Waged in court.</i>

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:57.042
I asked you, are you up to the task?
You said yes.

01:10:58.045 --> 01:10:59.957
I didn't want it to be political.

01:11:00.214 --> 01:11:01.204
You came to me, no?

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.333
When I asked what you wanted,
what did you say?

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:05.755
"When we're done with him,

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:09.255
"I want him to say
I'm 100 times worse than Sharon."

01:11:09.515 --> 01:11:12.974
If you can't handle it,
I'll drop the case.

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:27.440
Son of a bitch!

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.783
- Are you OK?
- Yes, you?

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:30.696
Fine.

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:45.919
<i>We know where you live.</i>

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:49.260
Who is this?

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:53.973
Who is it?

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:59.809
You don't scare me.
Don't call here.

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:02.228
Do you hear me?

01:12:02.568 --> 01:12:04.810
Asshole!

01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:10.565
<i>Fassouh Police.</i>

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:13.986
I'm being threatened.
Could you trace this number?

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.576
<i>We can't do that.</i>

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.119
You're the police.

01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:20.368
<i>Try the Attorney General's office.</i>

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:22.460
They're threatening my family.

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:24.705
<i>Come to the station
and fill out a report.</i>

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:33.426
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:12:42.733 --> 01:12:44.099
Turn the light off.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.147
Stay here. Don't leave.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:52.570
Who?

01:12:52.994 --> 01:12:55.077
Boss, it's me Eli.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.532
- What's wrong?
- The garage.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.077
It just happened.

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:21.515
We heard two bikes.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:24.098
Look.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:27.313
They're provoking us.

01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:30.529
The police don't care.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.277
That's him!

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.104
Mr. Deputy! Sir?

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:12.987
This poor man

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.278
delivers pizza to feed his family.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.447
Some hotshot lawyer

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.866
thinks anyone who rides a moped

01:14:21.832 --> 01:14:24.666
is pro-Palestinian,
and so deserves to be run over.

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:29.246
Are you accusing Tony Hanna
of being pro-Israel?

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:31.749
He serves their interests.
Same thing.

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:34.543
I call on anyone

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:36.670
who supports the Palestinian cause

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:38.672
to stand with Yasser Salameh.

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:10.454
I'm told you're both decent people,

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:13.549
love your families, work hard.

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:17.924
I work hard too:
squabbling deputies, water shortages,

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:20.046
power outages, trash collection,

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:24.176
two million refugees,
terrorists sneaking in.

01:15:24.562 --> 01:15:27.646
Where is this country headed?

01:15:28.357 --> 01:15:31.691
I've asked you to come here
to put an end to all this.

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:34.440
That's why we're in court,
Mr. President.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:35.483
How about

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.027
we resolve this out of court?

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:41.239
You know,
lawyers like to drag things out,

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:42.368
to show off.

01:15:42.621 --> 01:15:44.157
They have huge egos.

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:46.577
They don't care about you.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:47.915
They're working hard.

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:50.286
But they're not helping you reconcile.

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:54.168
You must set aside your differences,
for your country's sake.

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:56.041
Which one, Mr. President?

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:57.884
They hate this country.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.504
We live in the same country.
We're brothers.

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:02.638
No, we're not.

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:06.260
I want you to turn the page,
here and now,

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.261
and everyone goes home happy.

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:10.271
You can ask, but we can't.

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:11.560
Sure you can.

01:16:11.817 --> 01:16:13.524
It wouldn't be sincere.

01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:17.112
Between sincerity and stability,

01:16:17.364 --> 01:16:19.151
I'd choose stability.

01:16:20.201 --> 01:16:22.318
I could end the trial.

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:23.659
You can't do that.

01:16:23.996 --> 01:16:25.203
I'm the President.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:27.075
You're a state employee, sir.

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:31.292
We pay taxes
for you to protect our rights,

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:33.081
even our right to go to court.

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:35.083
What he's trying to tell you...

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:36.331
I don't care!

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:38.174
I went to his boss,

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:39.634
to the police,

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.048
then to court,

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:44.548
all I wanted was an apology,
but no one would hear me out.

01:16:44.809 --> 01:16:47.222
I feel you're siding with them too.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:50.141
Why?
Why does everyone take their side?

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:51.980
I'm not taking sides.

01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:53.565
Are they better than us?

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:55.559
I want to salvage the ship.

01:16:55.820 --> 01:16:57.812
We get punished, and they get impunity.

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:00.689
Why?
Are they God's chosen people?

01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:03.024
Do you want to start a war?

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.352
Get in.

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:40.671
Go ahead.

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:36.428
Mr. Geagea, let's get to the point.

01:19:36.689 --> 01:19:38.396
Tony Hanna said:

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:41.983
"I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out."

01:19:42.236 --> 01:19:43.477
What do you think?

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:46.696
We're not the Third Reich
telling our members,

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:48.611
what they can or can't say.

01:19:48.867 --> 01:19:53.487
Do Mr. Hanna's words reflect
your party's position?

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:55.454
Yes or no?

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.283
We've settled up with the Palestinians.

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:00.327
But look at the riots!

01:20:00.587 --> 01:20:02.499
The war ended in 1990,

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:05.464
but in people's heads,
it's still there.

01:20:05.718 --> 01:20:06.424
Why?

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:08.885
We never had a national reconciliation.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:11.220
Where's this reconciliation,

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.305
how can it happen,

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.892
when the warlords and religious figures

01:20:16.145 --> 01:20:17.727
are still in power,

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:20.229
including yourself?

01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:25.352
I offered a public apology
for mistakes we committed in the war.

01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:28.946
Many still think your party

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:31.282
was the most violent one,

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:33.868
and committed the most abuses
during the war.

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:35.407
Mr. Walid,

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:37.872
when you lose the war,

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:40.412
you become history's scapegoat.

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:44.704
I'd like to say something
to Tony Hanna:

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:47.374
I know you're watching.

01:20:48.218 --> 01:20:50.460
<i>Don't think I don't understand</i>

01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:51.882
your pain.

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.343
I know what happened to you.

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:56.299
We can't change the past.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:58.221
We can remember it,

01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:01.642
but we can't live in it
and let it control us.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.021
And then?

01:21:04.068 --> 01:21:05.184
The war is over.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:11.815
If Bashir Gemayel were still alive,
he would tell us the same thing,

01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:13.988
it's time to turn the page.

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:16.410
<i>Did your party</i>

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:21.082
<i>ask Wajdy Webb
to defend Tony Hanna?</i>

01:21:21.335 --> 01:21:22.166
<i>Not at all.</i>

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:24.877
<i>But he defended you in the past</i> ?

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.871
<i>It doesn't mean he works for us.</i>

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:32.343
Tony Hanna is registered
in Beirut,

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:34.428
District 135.

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:38.220
But the records show
he was born in District 112.

01:21:38.769 --> 01:21:41.477
The change of registry was in 1976.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.187
He was 6 years old.

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:48.276
Birthplace: Damour.

01:21:51.115 --> 01:21:52.651
Why didn't he mention it?

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:54.240
We didn't ask.

01:21:55.119 --> 01:21:56.655
Or he didn't want to.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:00.197
Tony Hanna didn't want to tell us.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.542
Take a look at these.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:45.374
Mr. Tony, have you ever belonged
to a militia?

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:46.208
No.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:49.626
Ever used a weapon?
Even a hunting rifle?

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:50.793
I never shot anyone.

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:55.043
Have you ever attended
a political rally?

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:57.504
Every rally of our party's leader.

01:22:58.849 --> 01:23:00.306
Did you ever fight in the war?

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:01.299
No.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.596
I wish I had.

01:23:03.353 --> 01:23:04.343
I was too young.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.847
- What if war starts?
- We are at war.

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:08.643
I mean a real war.

01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:15.063
I don't know. Maybe.

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:18.866
Do you have something
against Palestinians?

01:23:20.704 --> 01:23:23.868
"I wish Ariel Sharon
had wiped you all out."

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.616
Very insulting.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.623
Curse his mother, his sister, his honor,

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:33.752
our vocabulary is rich with insults.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.171
Why choose those words?

01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:38.135
I'm impressed.

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:41.096
You're good with words.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.262
You should join my law firm.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:48.354
As the defense said,
you went too far.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:50.057
From their first contact,

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:53.355
Tony Hanna knew
that Yasser Salameh was Palestinian.

01:23:53.612 --> 01:23:55.820
- You knew it from the start?
- Yes.

01:23:56.073 --> 01:23:57.985
How?

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.743
- From his accent.
- From his accent.

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:03.945
Any person in his right mind,

01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:07.324
wouldn't say what you said
to your opponent.

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:10.793
And if he assaulted you, it's because,

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:12.708
and I quote the defense:

01:24:14.424 --> 01:24:18.043
your words put him
"in extreme distress".

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:22.714
Mr. Tony,

01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:25.349
where do you come from?

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:30.563
Please tell us
which village you come from?

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:32.723
Damour.

01:24:33.235 --> 01:24:34.396
- Were you born there?
- Yes.

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:35.814
And your parents?

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.237
- Yes.
- What did your father do?

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:41.190
He grew bananas.

01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:45.240
Damour is famous for its bananas.
Still considered the best.

01:24:46.123 --> 01:24:48.661
How would you describe
your life back then?

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:51.075
- Normal.
- Like how?

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:51.951
Normal.

01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:57.048
Like in every village?
Simple, calm, peaceful?

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:57.882
Yes.

01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:00.422
A mainly Christian population?

01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:01.715
Yes.

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:05.639
When was the last time you went?

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:08.559
- A while ago.
- How long?

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:10.178
A while ago.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.977
- Ten, twenty, thirty years?
- Roughly.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.063
Damour is only a 20-minute drive.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.606
Stop asking.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:18.979
I don't need to go.

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:20.821
Don't need to, don't want to,

01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:22.315
or can't?

01:25:28.582 --> 01:25:30.323
How old are you now?

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:32.199
46.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:35.499
In 1976, you were 6 years old.

01:25:35.922 --> 01:25:36.833
Yes.

01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:46.469
Do you remember
the night of January 21, 1976?

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:51.602
Mr. Tony?

01:25:51.855 --> 01:25:53.437
May we talk in private?

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:54.396
Not now.

01:25:54.650 --> 01:25:57.393
- You don't have the right to...
- Not now!

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:00.648
Your Honors,

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:04.900
I have some footage
that I'd like to show, if I may.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.276
What sort of footage?

01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:11.369
Footage shot in Damour
between January 9 and 21, 1976.

01:26:11.792 --> 01:26:13.954
That's irrelevant to this trial.

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:18.922
The defense claims
Tony's words were driven by hate.

01:26:19.174 --> 01:26:22.087
I want to prove that it's true.

01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:25.010
The film will stir up emotions.
It's irrelevant.

01:26:25.263 --> 01:26:27.596
You made us listen to Bashir Gemayel,

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:29.465
it also stirred emotions.

01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:32.434
Can you describe them to us?

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:37.557
To better understand,
it must be seen.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.373
They used to call it
"The Bride of the Sea".

01:26:57.879 --> 01:26:59.461
It was a beautiful village.

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.047
Pristine beaches,

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:03.423
vast banana fields.

01:27:04.261 --> 01:27:07.129
Life in this village was calm,

01:27:07.639 --> 01:27:08.755
simple,

01:27:09.349 --> 01:27:10.556
peaceful.

01:27:12.185 --> 01:27:16.429
All that changed on January 9, 1976.

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:20.270
Trucks loaded with fighters,

01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:24.362
with artillery and rocket launchers
rolled into Damour.

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:28.321
They numbered
around 4,000 to 5,000 fighters.

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:32.412
Young men from the village,
in various Christian militias,

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:34.364
fought to protect the city.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.491
Most inhabitants,

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:38.368
around 15,000,

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:41.420
hid in the village of Sadiyat.

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:43.957
The Lebanese army

01:27:44.217 --> 01:27:47.551
could only send a few helicopters
to evacuate them.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.760
Families got separated.

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:56.686
Some stayed in Sadiyat,
others were evacuated to the north.

01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:06.028
Those who couldn't reach Sadiyat
took to the sea,

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:08.192
or fled along the train tracks.

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:15.830
Those who couldn't escape
hid in churches,

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:18.036
like Saint Eli Church.

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:23.458
Militiamen surrounded the village

01:28:23.924 --> 01:28:25.586
and launched the final assault.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.088
On January 21,

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:30.632
after 12 days of fighting,

01:28:31.431 --> 01:28:32.763
Damour fell.

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:36.975
They entered the village,

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:38.811
arrested many young men,

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:41.101
gathered them in the village square,

01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:43.395
lined them up,

01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:44.892
and executed them.

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:49.318
They combed every street, every house.

01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:51.531
The first victims
were Samy Rizk's family.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:53.404
The whole family was killed.

01:28:54.746 --> 01:28:57.614
The orders were to spare no one.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.207
Entire families were killed.

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:03.203
The Abu Merhis, the Metnis,

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:05.204
the Eids, the Abdallahs,

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:07.498
the Kanaan family.

01:29:07.926 --> 01:29:09.007
Children,

01:29:09.261 --> 01:29:10.047
mothers,

01:29:10.428 --> 01:29:11.259
fathers,

01:29:11.513 --> 01:29:12.424
grandfathers.

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:17.345
There are conflicting claims

01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:19.935
as to which militias
carried out the massacre,

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:22.396
but what's certain
is that it was carried out

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:25.767
by the Lebanese Left Wing Movement

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:29.070
and Palestinian factions,

01:29:29.739 --> 01:29:31.526
such as "Sayqa",

01:29:31.908 --> 01:29:33.365
and the Yarmuk army.

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:40.494
The images you're seeing
are the only ones that eXist.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:45.211
Most were taken by the militiamen
as a souvenir of their heroism.

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.635
More than 500 were killed,
22,000 refugees.

01:29:53.972 --> 01:29:55.838
It happened over a few days,

01:29:56.099 --> 01:29:57.180
quickly,

01:29:57.434 --> 01:29:58.299
and then,

01:29:58.643 --> 01:30:01.602
the freeway to Damour was reopened,

01:30:01.855 --> 01:30:05.599
as if a truck had flipped
or a dog had been run over.

01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:10.777
I know what you're thinking.

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:15.525
What we just saw,
we've become inured to it.

01:30:15.785 --> 01:30:17.276
It doesn't affect us anymore.

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:19.912
You may be right.

01:30:20.624 --> 01:30:21.910
But can you say this

01:30:22.876 --> 01:30:25.084
to the victims?

01:30:25.712 --> 01:30:27.169
Or their families?

01:30:34.512 --> 01:30:38.381
Tony Hanna's lived about 500 meters
from the main square.

01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:42.059
George Hanna didn't have many options.

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:44.224
Either hide them in the church, or...

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:57.025
Silence.

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:04.240
Counselor,

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:05.662
what happened?

01:31:05.919 --> 01:31:07.205
What did we expect?

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:12.040
The footage put him
in "extreme distress".

01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:31.804
How many ribs did I break?

01:33:32.482 --> 01:33:33.563
Two?

01:33:34.484 --> 01:33:36.020
I just patted you.

01:33:37.237 --> 01:33:38.648
You know what's your problem?

01:33:39.155 --> 01:33:40.942
You talk too much.

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:44.192
You drove everyone crazy,
lit this place on fire,

01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:45.988
because you talk too much.

01:33:46.246 --> 01:33:48.613
You just can't keep
your fucking mouth shut.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:52.078
Listen,

01:33:55.421 --> 01:33:58.664
your little show in court today
was pretty pathetic.

01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:01.417
What did you want to prove?

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:04.170
That you're the victim?

01:34:05.056 --> 01:34:06.297
Victim my ass!

01:34:11.062 --> 01:34:13.645
Everyone knows
who Lebanon's Christians are.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:16.185
You talked about defending your country

01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:18.934
while you lived
in your fancy beach villas.

01:34:19.445 --> 01:34:21.437
You played the tourists during the war.

01:34:21.823 --> 01:34:24.486
Shopping in Paris,
skiing in Switzerland.

01:34:24.742 --> 01:34:25.653
You eat sushi.

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:27.151
You speak French.

01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:31.663
Half the bombs that fell on you
didn't have detonators.

01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:34.454
You don't know what suffering is.

01:34:36.212 --> 01:34:37.919
What a bunch of cry babies!

01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:55.683
I'm sorry.

01:39:29.172 --> 01:39:30.538
Counselor.

01:39:36.179 --> 01:39:38.887
Forty years ago,
a massacre took place in Damour.

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:40.472
A heinous massacre.

01:39:41.601 --> 01:39:44.560
Thousands of families had to flee.

01:39:46.439 --> 01:39:49.853
Mr. Tony Hanna was
among the lucky survivors.

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:53.522
What happened back then
remains buried.

01:39:53.905 --> 01:39:56.272
The perpetrators unpunished.

01:39:58.075 --> 01:40:01.409
No justice. No closure. Nothing.

01:40:06.125 --> 01:40:10.369
We can understand why Tony Hanna
said those words to Yasser Salameh.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.706
He wanted revenge.

01:40:15.551 --> 01:40:19.215
For Tony, Yasser is guilty,
guilty by association.

01:40:21.307 --> 01:40:23.549
We've all been through hard times.

01:40:24.727 --> 01:40:27.219
We let our emotions
get the better of us,

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.601
like Tony Hanna
and Yasser Salameh.

01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:36.111
Yasser Salameh also reacted to words
that targeted his identity,

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.529
his history, his people's history.

01:40:40.785 --> 01:40:42.902
When one goes too far,

01:40:43.371 --> 01:40:45.283
and those words did,

01:40:46.290 --> 01:40:48.407
one must expect a reaction.

01:40:51.629 --> 01:40:53.040
It's normal.

01:40:54.048 --> 01:40:55.289
It's inevitable.

01:40:57.802 --> 01:40:59.634
It's human nature.

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:13.398
Counselor Wajdy.

01:41:19.115 --> 01:41:20.902
There was an article this morning

01:41:21.158 --> 01:41:24.526
about a US senator
who insulted a flight attendant.

01:41:24.787 --> 01:41:28.622
She asks him to turn his cellphone off.
So he calls her a bitch.

01:41:28.874 --> 01:41:31.036
The White House reacted.

01:41:31.544 --> 01:41:34.207
Finally, the senator issued
a public apology.

01:41:36.757 --> 01:41:40.467
I wonder if this could happen
in this country.

01:41:41.053 --> 01:41:42.635
If it's ever possible

01:41:42.888 --> 01:41:45.596
to settle a dispute
in a respectful manner,

01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:47.591
and consider an apology

01:41:47.852 --> 01:41:50.890
is not a sign of weakness,
but a sign of decency.

01:41:51.897 --> 01:41:54.890
That's all Mr. Hanna wanted.

01:41:55.151 --> 01:41:56.267
An apology.

01:41:56.652 --> 01:41:58.484
Plain and simple.

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:01.237
The defense maintains

01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:05.279
that Tony Hanna's words
targeted Mr. Salameh's identity,

01:42:05.536 --> 01:42:07.448
his history,
and his people's history.

01:42:07.705 --> 01:42:08.991
So he hit him.

01:42:09.874 --> 01:42:11.706
If Yasser Salameh is a refugee,

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:13.575
so is Tony Hanna.

01:42:13.836 --> 01:42:16.419
Even more,
a refugee in his own country.

01:42:16.672 --> 01:42:17.958
His life has been marred

01:42:18.215 --> 01:42:21.458
by the same suffering, tragedy,
and injustice.

01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:25.007
The only difference is

01:42:25.264 --> 01:42:29.554
we've never showed Tony and many others
the compassion they deserve.

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:32.598
On the contrary,
we've silenced them, ostracized them,

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:36.940
while we know all too well
what happened to the Palestinians.

01:42:38.778 --> 01:42:40.440
We talk so much about your cause,

01:42:41.656 --> 01:42:43.648
there's no room left
for anyone else.

01:42:45.034 --> 01:42:49.950
What happened in 1976
in Damour, Jiye, Sadiyat, and Nahme,

01:42:50.206 --> 01:42:51.993
we're not allowed to talk about it.

01:42:52.249 --> 01:42:56.163
But what Tony Hanna said
to Yasser Salameh, it's allowed.

01:42:56.754 --> 01:42:57.961
The truth is

01:42:58.214 --> 01:43:01.878
they're the product of an old wound
that has never healed.

01:43:04.595 --> 01:43:06.962
What's happening in this court

01:43:08.683 --> 01:43:10.015
is a beginning

01:43:10.559 --> 01:43:13.802
to consider and accept the other.

01:43:15.773 --> 01:43:19.813
Something must be said,
something relevant, fundamental.

01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:25.063
No one has a monopoly on suffering,
Your Honors.

01:43:25.658 --> 01:43:26.774
No one.

01:43:29.995 --> 01:43:33.454
<i>All eyes are on the Court ofAppeals.
The verdict is imminent.</i>

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:36.245
<i>From north to south,</i>

01:43:36.502 --> 01:43:38.710
<i>the army is on high alert...</i>

01:43:38.963 --> 01:43:41.831
<i>The verdict
in the Hanna vs Salameh case...</i>

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:45.425
<i>A reminder of the tough last two months
the country has been through...</i>

01:43:45.678 --> 01:43:50.719
<i>Judge Colette Mansur allowed the public
to view the proceedings.</i>

01:43:50.975 --> 01:43:55.686
<i>Will the verdict change
Palestinians' situation in Lebanon?</i>

01:43:56.230 --> 01:44:00.941
<i>Could this trial set a precedent
by examining old Civil War wounds?</i>

01:44:01.444 --> 01:44:06.735
<i>Will either side accept or appeal
the decision to the Supreme Court?</i>

01:44:06.991 --> 01:44:10.575
<i>Will this verdict spark
more rioting in the streets?</i>

01:44:10.828 --> 01:44:13.491
<i>This case now closes
after having profoundly rattled Lebanon.</i>

01:44:13.748 --> 01:44:16.957
<i>It has fueled waves of violence</i>

01:44:17.209 --> 01:44:20.202
<i>and brought back
memories of the Civil War.</i>

01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:23.042
Judge Colette Mansur presiding.

01:44:23.299 --> 01:44:24.756
All rise!

01:44:45.446 --> 01:44:47.483
Plaintiff and defendant, please rise.

01:44:59.168 --> 01:45:01.751
This seems like a cut-and-dry case,

01:45:02.004 --> 01:45:03.666
but in reality it's not.

01:45:04.298 --> 01:45:05.414
This is a case

01:45:05.674 --> 01:45:09.293
that involves two people
who each claim to be the victim.

01:45:10.346 --> 01:45:12.929
Words were uttered,
and an assault was committed.

01:45:13.182 --> 01:45:16.391
You each believe you were in the right.

01:45:17.728 --> 01:45:21.062
The issue is which of you is at fault,

01:45:21.315 --> 01:45:23.307
or more at fault.

01:45:24.193 --> 01:45:26.936
Do the words
outweigh the physical aggression,

01:45:27.196 --> 01:45:29.654
or are they equally incriminating?

01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:33.196
Basically,
a physical assault is unacceptable.

01:45:33.452 --> 01:45:35.535
You can't take the law
into your own hands,

01:45:35.788 --> 01:45:40.408
eXcept for clear and imminent danger,
meaning self-defense.

01:45:42.253 --> 01:45:43.585
At the same time,

01:45:44.255 --> 01:45:47.874
does an insult carry the same weight
as physical assault,

01:45:48.425 --> 01:45:51.213
when the insult is demeaning
and hurtful?

01:45:52.847 --> 01:45:56.761
At one point, we were tempted
to find you both guilty.

01:45:57.017 --> 01:46:00.601
But based on the evidence
submitted by both lawyers,

01:46:00.855 --> 01:46:04.439
we had to go back to how it all started.

01:46:04.859 --> 01:46:08.728
By virtue of majority vote,
two for, and one against,

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:10.562
this court finds

01:46:10.823 --> 01:46:12.030
Yasser Salameh

01:46:12.283 --> 01:46:13.399
not guilty.
