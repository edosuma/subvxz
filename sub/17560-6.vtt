00:01.668 --> 00:03.628
[chuckles]
Ben.

00:03.711 --> 00:06.464
Okay, well,
now I'm having a French fry.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.717
Now I'm dipping it in ketchup.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.803
Wow, this would make
an amazing movie.

00:11.886 --> 00:14.681
Tina, would you shut up?
I haven't talked to Ben all day.

00:14.764 --> 00:17.100
We have important things
to discuss.

00:17.183 --> 00:20.186
Did I tell you
they were crinkle fries?

00:20.270 --> 00:22.272
No way, no way.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.691
No way.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.943
Hello? Hello.

00:27.026 --> 00:28.278
Oh, man, I lost him.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.072
Aw, you didn't get to tell him
about your pickle.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.531
Alright, Tina, I'm sorry.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.367
I know that I've been
a little nauseating lately

00:34.451 --> 00:35.702
and if this were you doing it

00:35.785 --> 00:38.079
I'd totally be grossed out,
too, but..

00:38.163 --> 00:40.832
I think that I'm ready
to tell Ben I love him.

00:40.915 --> 00:42.625
- What, are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.170
You have never told any guy that
you loved him. This is huge.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.464
I know, and I don't know
how I wanna do it.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.966
I mean, this is something
I wanna remember forever.

00:50.049 --> 00:53.094
The time, the place.
I want everything to be perfect.

00:53.178 --> 00:56.264
Oh, my God, this is so cool.
We're both in love.

00:56.347 --> 00:59.309
You have Ben, and as soon
as my boss divorces his wife

00:59.392 --> 01:00.894
I'll have him.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.521
Tina, Ben and I
have a healthy love.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.815
You love your boss
who loves his wife

01:05.899 --> 01:07.650
and thinks your name is Tammy.

01:07.734 --> 01:11.529
Tammy, Lisa, Steve,
he's talking to me.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.072
[cell phone rings]

01:13.156 --> 01:17.368
Hello? Oh, my God, I always
lose reception there too.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.205
Hello? Oh, actually,
I have another call. Hold up.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.832
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me. You suck.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.628
- I'm leaving.
- Tina, wait. I'm sorry.

01:26.711 --> 01:27.962
You're pretty.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.174
Okay, so, where are you now?

01:31.257 --> 01:34.552
Uh, I just got to the diner
and there's this gorgeous girl

01:34.636 --> 01:36.679
standing in front of me
who I just have to kiss.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.598
Okay, bye.

01:38.681 --> 01:40.141
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.061
Sit.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.772
So, um, I was thinking,
maybe later we could do

01:45.855 --> 01:47.982
something kind of special,
just you and me.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.651
Like maybe go to that place
in Central Park

01:49.734 --> 01:51.277
we went the first time
you were here.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.823
Oh, the place where they found
that dead homeless guy?

01:54.906 --> 01:58.368
Yeah, or maybe we could
just go to your place.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.995
I'll bring a candle.

02:01.079 --> 02:04.207
Okay. And maybe I could
play you my new song?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.584
[gasps]
Oh, my God, you did it?
Let me hear.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.961
Not to sway you,
but I think it's fantastic.

02:09.044 --> 02:11.840
- Aww.
- So what do you think?

02:11.923 --> 02:14.008
You know, I think that
I'm gonna go upstairs

02:14.092 --> 02:15.593
and listen to it by myself.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.886
Oh, okay, you'll call me?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.180
- The minute I'm finished.
- Okay.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.683
[gasps]
Oh, my God,
the intro is amazing.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.190
Oh, my God, isn't it
the worst song ever?

02:29.274 --> 02:31.442

[instrumental music]

03:13.568 --> 03:14.986
What should I do?

03:15.069 --> 03:17.030
How can I look
into Ben's beautiful eyes

03:17.113 --> 03:19.949
and tell him his song sucks?

03:20.033 --> 03:22.952
I mean, do I do it after I tell
him I love him or before?

03:24.412 --> 03:26.414
Wait, you love him?

03:26.497 --> 03:29.375
Oh, my God, she loves him.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.545
That is so beautiful.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.130
Well, it was a lot
more beautiful

03:34.213 --> 03:35.798
when his song didn't suck.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.884
- You really love him?
- Yeah.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.887
But how do I tell him
I love him and hate his song?

03:40.970 --> 03:43.598
Lie, lie, lie, lie.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.016
You tell him you love him

03:45.099 --> 03:47.435
and that his song
made you love him even more.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.437
Trust me, I was honest
with a guy once

03:49.520 --> 03:51.272
ended up spending
New Year's Eve home alone

03:51.356 --> 03:53.650
with my donut maker.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.818
What kind of garbage
are you telling the girl?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.738
Oh, I forgot.
Glenda the Good Witch is here.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.616
Now, Holly, do not listen
to her, alright?

04:01.699 --> 04:03.993
Relationships are built
on honesty and trust

04:04.077 --> 04:07.288
and if you can't be honest
with Ben, then you have nothing.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.499
Now be gone before someone
drops a house on you.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.294
Hey, when did you get
that fancy espresso maker?

04:13.378 --> 04:14.837
Oh, uh, it's Rick's.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.173
He's been dropping some
of his stuff over all morning.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.051
Ooh, and you're letting
his black espresso maker

04:20.134 --> 04:21.970
mix with your white toaster?

04:22.053 --> 04:23.888
Hey, your sister is growing.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.807
And besides, if black
and white didn't mix

04:25.890 --> 04:28.685
we would not have Halle Berry.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.520
We are getting married
in a few weeks.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.230
I have to learn
to live with his stuff.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.606
- What's the big deal?
- Okay.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.358
Well, since you're so, um,
fine with it

04:35.441 --> 04:37.193
let's see what else
Rick has in his box.

04:37.276 --> 04:42.448
Oh-ho, the always elegant
bobble head.

04:42.532 --> 04:48.287
And, um, oh, a framed poster
of a chimp on a toilet.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.916
Oh, God, I'm marrying
Fred Flintstone.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.376
Just, uh, put it back
in the box.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.878
Okay, are you sure you're gonna
be honest with Rick?

04:55.962 --> 04:58.881
Yes, just like you should
be honest with Ben.

04:58.965 --> 05:01.592
What the hell is wrong
with you two?

05:01.676 --> 05:04.178
Val is 21 days away
from the altar.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.932
She has the right to, to lie,
steal, falsify documents

05:08.016 --> 05:10.059
to cross that finish line.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.979
Lauren, no, I am not hanging
chimp on toilet.

05:13.062 --> 05:16.232
I will tell Rick the truth as
soon as I find the right moment.

05:31.330 --> 05:33.082
It's the first piece
of art I ever bought.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.376
Huh. There was
an artist involved.

05:36.961 --> 05:39.547
It's functional art.
He's a beer butler.

05:39.630 --> 05:41.799
I named him Fred or Fredericka.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.135
Depends on how many beers
he's served me.

05:46.220 --> 05:49.474
- So what do you think?
- Yeah, Val.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.809
Tell Rick what you think
of the little fella.

05:53.686 --> 05:57.398
Honey, to, uh,
be honest with you

05:57.482 --> 06:02.153
um, I don't think
Fred fits in here.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.197
Oh.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.448
Okay.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.867
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.869
Thank you for understanding.

06:09.952 --> 06:12.163
Mmm, but he's staying.

06:13.956 --> 06:14.916
I'm sorry. What?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.209
- He's staying.
- He's staying.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.127
Yeah, I heard what he said.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.463
Okay, uh, look, Rick,
no, he cannot stay

06:20.546 --> 06:22.799
because, see,
I'm kinda going for, uh

06:22.882 --> 06:24.717
like a contemporary
modern thing here

06:24.801 --> 06:27.929
and he is contemporary ugly.

06:29.847 --> 06:33.017
Okay, first of all,
he has a name.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.769
And secondly,
we talked about this.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.938
I mean, you told me you were
gonna share your space with me.

06:37.021 --> 06:40.149
Yes, and I'm going to,
but I like to have

06:40.233 --> 06:42.860
nice stuff in my place.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.529
Your place.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.949
Our place.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.201
My stuff.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.662
Okay, we heard that,
you know?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.624
And just so you know,
when you marry me

06:56.707 --> 06:58.501
you're also getting Fred
and if you can't handle that

06:58.584 --> 07:00.169
well, you know what,
now is a good time to tell me.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.713

a little, ugly wooden man

07:12.306 --> 07:13.516
come between us?

07:13.599 --> 07:15.852
- Are you?
- Oh, my God.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.728
I, I, I..

07:17.812 --> 07:20.606
- You, you..
- Okay, I'm leaving.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.608
When you're ready to live
like a real couple

07:22.692 --> 07:24.569
and form whole words, call me.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.237
Hey, wait, I have an idea.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.531
Why don't you let your little
butler open the door for you?

07:28.614 --> 07:31.409
He's a beer butler.
That's all he does.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.037
Yeah, well, he better
do more than that

07:35.121 --> 07:37.415
because that's who
you're gonna be sleeping with.

07:43.421 --> 07:47.049
- You really liked it?
- Liked it? I loved it.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.261
- Your song was amazing.
- Oh, I knew it. Thank you.

07:50.344 --> 07:52.763
- What was your favorite part?
- The end.

07:54.182 --> 07:57.059
- Hey, where are you going?
- Oh, I've to go.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.645
But I have something
to tell you.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.398
I brought the candle.

08:02.481 --> 08:04.066
Do you remember that producer
we met at CBGB?

08:04.150 --> 08:05.693
I told him I'd send him
my new song.

08:05.776 --> 08:07.945
He said if he likes it,
we can record it in his studio

08:08.029 --> 08:10.781
but I wanted to make sure
you liked it first.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.033
Oh, um..

08:12.116 --> 08:14.076
I've only got, uh, eight
minutes to overnight it

08:14.160 --> 08:15.411
so he'll have it
for the weekend.

08:15.494 --> 08:16.829
But, Ben, don't you think
that you should wait--

08:16.913 --> 08:17.914
This is huge, Holly.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.123
I don't know how to thank you.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.417
Okay, but, Ben.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.462
What's Queen Elizabeth
so excited about?

08:24.545 --> 08:26.255
He's about to send a tape
to this producer

08:26.339 --> 08:28.049
and it could ruin his career.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.717
What should I do?

08:29.800 --> 08:31.302
- Dump him.
- What?

08:31.385 --> 08:33.804
What? Go after him!
Why, what'd you hear? God!

08:38.100 --> 08:40.227
- Ben, hey.
- Hey.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.854
Holly, did you come down here
to wish me luck?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.940
- I love that about you.
- Yeah.

08:45.399 --> 08:48.486
Oh, my God, Ben, look.

08:48.569 --> 08:49.862
Can you save my place?

08:49.946 --> 08:52.406
Wait, isn't that the busboy
from our diner?

08:52.490 --> 08:56.494
[gasps]
First, putting his finger
in my soup and now murder?

08:56.577 --> 08:58.120
Oh. We need to alert
the authorities.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.956
- Come on, let's go.
- Holly, Holly.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.791
You're very funny, but I really
have to get this mailed.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.168
No, no, no, wait, Ben,
you can't send this song.

09:04.252 --> 09:08.506
- Why not?
- Because it's not good.

09:08.589 --> 09:11.467
- You said you loved it.
- I lied.

09:11.550 --> 09:13.344
- What do you mean you lied?
- I'm sorry.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.471
I wanted to tell you the truth,
but then Rick came over

09:15.554 --> 09:16.973
and brought over a little
wooden man and then--

09:17.056 --> 09:19.141
Holly, what kind of relationship
can we possibly have

09:19.225 --> 09:20.977
if you're not gonna be honest
with me?

09:21.060 --> 09:22.853
A long one?

09:22.937 --> 09:25.356
- You think that's funny?
- No.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.024
Okay, that's another lie
'cause I did think

09:27.108 --> 09:29.068
that was kind of funny.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.946
Holly, how am I ever supposed
to trust you if you lie to me?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.994
Ben, no, wait.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.704
I'm sorry.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.749
[grumbling]

09:45.543 --> 09:48.629
Okay, the mumble,
kinda irritating.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.299
Okay, you, kinda fired.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.175
Don't take your anger
out on me.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.678
If you had lied in the first
place like I told you

09:55.761 --> 09:58.889
you never would've had
your stupid fight with Rick.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.183
I'll tell you
whose fault it is.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.185
His.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.646
You stupid little man.

10:05.730 --> 10:08.107
You know what?
I wish you were never carved.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.984
Oh, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

10:10.067 --> 10:11.569
Run, Fred, run.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.905
Okay, Val, stop.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.991
Are you sure you wanna
throw that metaphor

10:17.074 --> 10:18.826
for your relationship
off the balcony?

10:18.909 --> 10:21.412
Yes, I hate
this wooden piece of crap.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.331
Hey, Valerie, stop.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.709
Now, look at yourself.
Look what you are doing.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.296
Now no one has to get hurt here.

10:30.379 --> 10:34.675
Just release the boy
and slowly back away.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.179
Oh, God.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.931
Lauren, wh-what is wrong
with me? What am I doing?

10:41.015 --> 10:44.894
Well, I'd rather not answer that
when we're so close to the edge.

10:44.977 --> 10:47.146
No, you're right, I should
welcome Rick's stuff

10:47.229 --> 10:50.649
into my life because they're
part of Rick and the man I love.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.903
I don't wanna be sick.
I wanna be happy, Lauren.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.571
And that's what I'm gonna do,
I am gonna call Rick

10:55.654 --> 10:59.367
and I am going to apologize
and welcome Freddy..

11:00.993 --> 11:02.870
Freddy? Freddy?

11:02.953 --> 11:05.122
Oh, my God!
Call a carpenter.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.629
[knocks]

11:11.712 --> 11:14.298
Hey, if Ben is here, tell him
he doesn't have to talk to me.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.885
- I just came to get my purse.
- He's not here.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.429
What's up?
Are you guys fighting?

11:20.513 --> 11:22.598
Yeah, but it's my fault.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.392
I lied about his song,
but I only did it

11:24.475 --> 11:26.435
so I wouldn't hurt his feelings.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.397
Ben's pretty hung up on that
whole honesty thing, isn't he?

11:30.731 --> 11:31.690
Well, hello.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.567
- Hi.
- Oh. Fiona.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.444
I want you to meet
a friend of mine.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.947
This is Holly, Ben's girlfriend.

11:38.030 --> 11:41.742
Holly, this is Fiona,
Ben's wife.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.121
- I'm sorry. What?
- Oh, no, you heard it right.

11:53.295 --> 11:57.007
I'm sorry. Ben's wife?
Ben's married?

11:57.091 --> 12:02.638
[groans]
I am so sorry you had
to find out like this.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.723
[sighs]
Come here.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.726
Holly, don't bum out.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.146
I haven't seen Benjy in,
like, two years.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.022
So, how did you two kids
meet, anyway?

12:12.106 --> 12:14.066
Well, I was on vacation
in London

12:14.150 --> 12:16.986
and I met Benjy at a club
and one drink led to another

12:17.069 --> 12:18.946
and the next thing you know,
we're driving to Bristol

12:19.029 --> 12:21.282
which is like their Vegas
and we got hitched.

12:21.365 --> 12:24.076
[laughs]
That's right,
you told me that.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.744
Yeah.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.538
Isn't that kinda how
you met Benjy?

12:27.621 --> 12:29.165
No. No, no, no, no, no.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.959
I met Ben in a pub.
They met in a club.

12:32.042 --> 12:33.669
Pub, club, pub, club,
very different.

12:33.752 --> 12:35.629
You know what, Vince,
would you mind giving me

12:35.713 --> 12:38.549
a minute alone
with Mrs. Benjy's wife?

12:38.632 --> 12:40.634
Okay, I'll go, but I just
want you to remember that

12:40.718 --> 12:43.929
Fiona here is merely a victim
much like yourself.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.848
- The true villain is Ben.
- Get out.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.766
- Okay. You should dump him.
- What?

12:47.850 --> 12:49.685
What? I said you and Ben
should work it out.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.854
Why, what'd you hear? God!

12:54.106 --> 12:57.067
[cell phone rings]

12:57.151 --> 12:58.027
Yo.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.612
Dude, you're never gonna believe

12:59.695 --> 13:01.489
who's in our apartment.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.699
- Ben has a wife?
- What?

13:03.782 --> 13:05.367
And apparently, she's hot.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.369
How perfect is this?
They're gonna fight.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.830
Holly's gonna need someone
to comfort her.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.500
Me, who will pick up
her favorite dessert

13:12.583 --> 13:16.003
bring it over to her, gotta go.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.755
Hey.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.799
What's wrong, mate?
You lost your smile.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.303
Yeah, Holly and I had
a little fight.

13:24.386 --> 13:27.515
Well, then you get in there
and make up with her.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.021
Hello.
Did you come by to apologize?

13:34.104 --> 13:36.357
Oh, there's going to be
an apology.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.692
- Benjy.
- Oh, my damn.

13:40.569 --> 13:43.489
Fiona, what, what a surprise.
What are you doing here?

13:43.572 --> 13:45.950
Oh, she just stopped by
to say hi.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.577
'Cause, you know,
she's your wife.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.955
She's not my wife.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.582
Well, she-she was my wife for,
like, what, 48 hours

13:53.666 --> 13:54.875
but then we got divorced.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.710
Um, actually,
that's why I'm here.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.212
You see, I'm getting
married again

13:58.295 --> 14:01.173
and I sort of forgot
to file the divorce papers.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.425
I know.
If it wasn't screwed on.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.096
You are unbelievable.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.931
You made me feel like
a horrible person

14:09.014 --> 14:10.099
for lying about your song

14:10.182 --> 14:12.059
and you didn't tell me
you were married?

14:12.142 --> 14:13.477
Hey, hey, hey, I didn't lie.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.771
I just haven't told you
every little thing about me.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.106
I mean, it was one drunken night

14:17.189 --> 14:18.691
and I assure you,
it was no big deal.

14:18.774 --> 14:21.819
Okay, well, when I marry
someone, it will be a big deal.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.988
And this is a big deal to me.

14:27.783 --> 14:30.035
Should I have called first?

14:40.504 --> 14:41.714
You think Rick will notice?

14:41.797 --> 14:44.383
Uh, not if you throw him
off the balcony too.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.261
That's it.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.971
Rick's gonna think
I killed Fred on purpose

14:49.054 --> 14:50.639
because I don't want
his stuff in my house.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.349
And he's gonna think
I'm controlling

14:52.433 --> 14:54.518
and incapable of having
a good relationship

14:54.602 --> 14:57.521
and he's never gonna
wanna be with me.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.774
Unbelievable. I don't even
wanna talk about it.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.985
- What?
- Ben's married.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.113
That's right, the man I was
about to say I love you to

15:06.196 --> 15:07.281
has a wife.

15:07.364 --> 15:09.575
Who is he?
I don't even know him.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.368
Oh, my God.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.912
Everyone's getting married
but me!

15:16.290 --> 15:17.666
How could he be married?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.585
He said he was only married
for 48 hours

15:19.668 --> 15:21.962
and he thought he was divorced
but the point is

15:22.046 --> 15:23.672
he lied to me about it.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.049
And if Ben's lied to me
about that

15:25.132 --> 15:27.384
who knows what else
he's lied about.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.638
Maybe he's not even British.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.473
[imitates British accent]
Hello, mate.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.099

[knock on door]

15:39.104 --> 15:43.692
Uh, Holly, I see flowers
and a big, sad British head.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.027
(Ben)
'Holly, are you in there?'

15:45.110 --> 15:47.321
- I'm not here.
- Uh, she's not here.

15:47.404 --> 15:50.366
And I don't ever wanna
talk to you again, Ben.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.035
He's gone, he doesn't exactly
put up much of a fight, does he?

15:53.118 --> 15:56.080
- I can't believe this.
- You're right. Lying does suck.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.331
[knock on door]

15:57.414 --> 15:59.625

Oh, God, Rick. Fred!

16:02.002 --> 16:03.420
No, he can't see Fred.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.172
Oh, what..
Okay, um, uh..

16:07.716 --> 16:09.093
Hi.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.721
Hi.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.432
What brings you here
on this fine fall day?

16:15.516 --> 16:17.726
I just came by to talk.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.561
You know, I got to thinking
about our situation

16:19.645 --> 16:22.648
and I had no right
to push my stuff on you

16:22.731 --> 16:25.526
so I came by to pick up Fred.

16:25.609 --> 16:26.777
Oh, God.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.696
I think I'm gonna
give him to my dad.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.948
Lately, he's been having
health issues

16:31.031 --> 16:33.659
and I think Fred would
really cheer him up.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.618
Oh, God.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.661
It's just that he's been waiting

16:35.744 --> 16:37.996
for his test results and, um..

16:38.080 --> 16:39.206
Are you serious?

16:39.289 --> 16:43.669
No, I found
Fred's ear downstairs.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.672
What is wrong with you?
I was worried about your father.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.382
No, no, no,
you do not get to be mad.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.843
I get to be mad.
Now, where is he?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.973
Oh, my God.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.392
Fred. Fred.

16:58.475 --> 17:00.519
He can't hear you.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.108
Honey, I'm so, so, so sorry.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.444
I killed Fred and I know
how much you loved him.

17:09.528 --> 17:12.281
I-I would understand
if you think I'm a crazy person

17:12.364 --> 17:14.782
and you don't wanna marry me.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.410
Not marry you?

17:17.744 --> 17:19.454
You aren't crazy.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.874
You actually think I would
throw everything we have away

17:21.957 --> 17:24.251
just for one little screw up?

17:24.334 --> 17:26.587
I don't know.

17:26.670 --> 17:30.340
Val, we're gonna be married,
which means we're gonna be

17:30.424 --> 17:33.218
living together and sometimes,
one of us is gonna do something

17:33.302 --> 17:34.970
that's gonna piss
the other one off

17:35.053 --> 17:38.015

you're pretty damn close.

And the truth is, the reason
I didn't wanna tell you

19:57.321 --> 20:00.198
is that I didn't want you
to be disappointed in me.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.159
Oh, I'm not disappointed.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.952
Look, I lied about your song

20:04.036 --> 20:05.954
and you lied
about having a wife.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.873
God! Yours was so much worse.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.502

we both made mistakes.

you forgive them.

- Yeah.

I love you.

- Really?
- Yeah.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.813
And I know
it's only been two months

20:31.897 --> 20:33.440
and it's okay if you're not
ready to tell me

20:33.523 --> 20:34.608
but I just wanted you to know--

20:34.691 --> 20:36.860
- I love you too.
