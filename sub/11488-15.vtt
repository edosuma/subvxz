00:01.800 --> 00:02.700
Hey.

00:02.800 --> 00:03.700
Oh, hey.

00:03.800 --> 00:04.800
You're back early.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.100
How was your date?

00:06.600 --> 00:09.200
I hate electric cars.

00:09.900 --> 00:12.100
I don't like scented candles.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.400
Once again, how was your date?

00:16.500 --> 00:19.000
It was fine until
her estranged husband

00:19.000 --> 00:22.500
silently pulled into the
driveway in his freakin' Prius.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.400
If he hadn't stepped on the cat,
I'd be dead now.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.000
What are you doing?

00:30.400 --> 00:30.900
Me?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.700
Uh, nothing.
Just, uh...

00:33.300 --> 00:34.700
nothing.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.200
You were surfing for porn,
weren't you?

00:38.700 --> 00:40.900
Uh... yes.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Okay, that's, that's
what I was doing.

00:43.100 --> 00:44.000
You caught me.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.400
I'm so embarrassed.

00:47.900 --> 00:51.100
Well, you should be;
it's disgusting.

00:52.800 --> 00:55.200
Come on, let's see what puts
a chubby in your chinos.

00:55.300 --> 00:57.900
No, no, it's personal.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.400
Ooh,hat are you into,
grannies with trannies?

01:01.400 --> 01:02.800
Chickens with strap-ons?

01:02.900 --> 01:04.599
Please, please don't,
Charlie. Pl...

01:08.600 --> 01:11.300
Oh, you pitiful freak!

01:12.900 --> 01:14.000
What is wrong with you?

01:14.100 --> 01:16.900
Nothing, I came
upon it by accident.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.500
I am so ashamed.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.900
My own brother using an...

01:21.800 --> 01:24.400
Internet dating service.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.800
I'm a man, Charlie.
I have needs.

01:34.000 --> 01:34.600
Ok

01:34.700 --> 01:35.800
???

01:35.900 --> 01:38.200
that the Roman Empire
made to civilization.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.200
Um... Roman numerals.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.200
Good.

01:41.500 --> 01:42.800
Aqueducts...

01:42.900 --> 01:44.100
Terrific.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.000
Do you know what
an aqueduct is?

01:46.100 --> 01:47.700
Uh, something to do with water.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.100
And...?

01:49.200 --> 01:50.500
A duck?

01:52.800 --> 01:53.500
Morning.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.800
Morning
Morning, Charlie.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.100
Morning, Rose.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.900
What's going on?

01:59.800 --> 02:02.800
She's helping Yertle the Ttle
study for his test.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.200
Why didn't he ask me?

02:06.400 --> 02:07.800
Name three contributions

02:07.900 --> 02:10.199
the Roman Empire
made to civilization.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.900
Orgies, wine and bulimia.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.300
Go ahead, ask me
about the Greeks.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.500
Then who did invent
aromatherapy?

02:20.700 --> 02:22.200
Not the Romans.

02:22.300 --> 02:23.900
But you see my logic.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.400
You know,
I never did understand

02:27.500 --> 02:29.500
why you didn't give her
more of a chance.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.300
She's pretty, smart,

02:31.400 --> 02:34.500
and amazingly patient
with dumb guys.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.900
Are you talking
about Jake or me?

02:38.000 --> 02:40.200
A smart guy wouldn't
have to ask that question.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.700
Excuse me, but
let's not forget

02:43.800 --> 02:45.500
this is a woman
who stalked me,

02:45.600 --> 02:48.000
who spied on me,
who snuck into my house

02:48.100 --> 02:50.800
to write her name and
address in my underwear.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.600
Oh, boo-hoo.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.700
Somebody cares
about Charlie.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.800
Nobody ever wrote
their name in my underwear.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.100
Wait, once.
The Department of Corrections.

03:03.700 --> 03:04.400
Morning.

03:04.700 --> 03:05.900
Morning.
Hey.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.300
Hey, guys.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.500
How's the homework coming?

03:08.700 --> 03:11.100
The three major buildings
in ancient Rome

03:11.200 --> 03:14.400
were the Coliseum,
the Forum and...

03:14.800 --> 03:15.700
Circus...

03:15.800 --> 03:17.400
Circus Circus.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.300
We need a little
more time.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.300
Carry on.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.100
I know 's not Caesar's Palace.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.400
Why don't you get him
a real tutor?

03:27.700 --> 03:28.500
Are you kidding?

03:28.600 --> 03:31.100
She has advanced degrees
in, like, three subjects,

03:31.200 --> 03:32.900
she loves him,
he worships her,

03:33.000 --> 03:34.500
and the only thing
she asks in return

03:34.600 --> 03:37.000
is to sit naked in
your laundry hamper
every once in a while.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.700
And that's not
a red flag for you?

03:39.800 --> 03:41.300
You could do a lot worse
than Rose, Charlie.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.000
I have done a lot worse.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.100
But that's not really
a recommendation now, is it?

03:46.200 --> 03:50.100
The second triumviratewas Augustus,

03:50.500 --> 03:51.600
Lepidus.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.100
Very good.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.200
Okay, well, that's
it for today.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.300
Wait a minute.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.300
Oh, right.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.900
Open up.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.300
Mmm, cookie.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.600
Hey, Charlie,
u got a minute?

04:10.800 --> 04:12.700
I'd like to talk
to you privately.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.900
Now's not a good time, Rose.

04:15.100 --> 04:16.500
Will you call me later?

04:16.600 --> 04:17.000
Sure.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.399
Promise?

04:18.600 --> 04:19.100
Yeah.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.100
Cross your heart
and hope to die?

04:22.500 --> 04:23.300
Yes.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.800
Stick a needle in your eye?

04:26.100 --> 04:27.100
Okay.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.100
Boil in oil until you fry?

04:29.200 --> 04:31.500
Dear God, Rose, I will call you.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Toodles.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.600
You're not going to call her,
are you?

04:38.700 --> 04:41.200
No, I think I'm going to go
with the neee in the eye.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:03.000 --> 05:07.400
Funny, you didn't mention
in your dating profile ???

05:07.500 --> 05:09.400
Hey, what are you doing
growing to my laptop?

05:09.500 --> 05:13.600
Just learning a lile about
you, Spimaster278.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.600
I see you like
smooth jazz,

05:16.700 --> 05:18.600
long walks on the beach
and cuddling.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.000
Give me that.
Now hold on.
Hold on.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.600
This is my
favorite part.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.800
"I love to spend
quiet weekends

05:23.900 --> 05:26.200
puttering around my
Malibu beach house."

05:27.200 --> 05:28.500
Educate me, Alan.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.400
To what Malibu beach
house are you referring?

05:31.600 --> 05:33.100
Okay, okay, I was going
to tell you about that.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.800
Do you have one that
I don't know about?

05:35.100 --> 05:36.500
No, no.
'Cause if you do,

05:36.600 --> 05:38.400
one of us should
beiving there.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.200
Are you going to let me
explain, or not?

05:40.300 --> 05:41.300
What's to explain?

05:41.400 --> 05:43.300
You have a Malibu beach
house and you're the...

05:43.900 --> 05:45.900
"chiropractor
to the stars."

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
Okay, what do you want me
to call myself?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.300
Chiropractor to fat people
in the valley?

05:50.400 --> 05:52.300
Everybody exaggerates
on these things.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.900
Okay, I can understand that.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.700
You're probably not going
to get a lot of responses

05:55.800 --> 05:57.400
to "bushy-nosed cheapskate,

05:57.500 --> 05:59.200
enjoys long walks
to a free meal."

06:00.500 --> 06:01.500
Exactly.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.900
Hey, you're going out
tonight, aren't you?

06:05.000 --> 06:05.600
Why?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.300
Well, I met a woman
on this dating site

06:08.400 --> 06:10.100
and she's here
and it would be good if...

06:10.300 --> 06:11.400
you weren't.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.700
You're throwing me
out of my own house?

06:13.800 --> 06:17.100
Well, no, if you read
the profile, it's my house.

06:18.300 --> 06:18.900
See?

06:20.800 --> 06:21.500
Coming!

06:21.600 --> 06:22.900
Be right there!

06:23.300 --> 06:23.900
Please play along.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.200
You're going to
play along, right?

06:25.300 --> 06:27.300
I guess we'll find out
together, won't we?

06:34.900 --> 06:36.700
Alan, hi.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.800
Beverly, it's so great to
finally meet you in person.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.700
Hi.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.100
Hello.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.300
Oh, this is Charlie.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.600
Oh, right, your poor brother.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.400
Hi, Charlie.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.300
How are you?

07:02.100 --> 07:04.700
Mmm, you smell nice.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.200
Okay, okay, come on in.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.200
Oh, my,

07:09.300 --> 07:11.200
what a beautiful home.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.000
Thank you.
Thank you.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.200
I encourage him to think
of this place as his own.

07:18.300 --> 07:22.700
Yeah, that way, I don't feel
like such a worthless parasite.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.300
Charlie, weren't you
going out tonight?

07:26.500 --> 07:30.400
Gee, I'd love to, but
you know me, flat broke again.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
Oh, well, I suppose I could
float you a few bucks.

07:35.200 --> 07:35.800
What do you need?

07:35.900 --> 07:37.800
$400.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.000
Okay. Okay.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.400
You know, I'll... I'll just
give you everything I have.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.600
Uh... that's
31, 32... $33.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.100
What about the secret
compartment?

07:51.200 --> 07:52.100
All right.

07:55.800 --> 07:55.800
That'll be a, uh...

07:55.800 --> 07:57.100
00:07:59,700
$133.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.500
And I don't expect to
see you again tonight.

08:02.600 --> 08:03.900
Thanks, bro.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.200
Be nice to him;
he's all I've got.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.800
Sorry about that.

08:11.900 --> 08:12.700
I understand.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.700
I have a sister
who's a crack whore.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.000
Really?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.000
Maybe we can introduce them.

08:19.100 --> 08:22.500
For $133, we can
introduce them twice.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.600
Terrific.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.000
Well, here we are.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.300
We sure are.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.000
I guess you've noticed

08:33.100 --> 08:35.200
I'm a little taller
than five-nine.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.500
Well, yeah, but everybody
fudges a little

08:37.600 --> 08:38.900
on those dating profiles.

08:39.299 --> 08:40.100
How tall are you?

08:40.200 --> 08:41.600
Five-thirteen.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.000
Leanne, tell me something,

08:52.600 --> 08:55.500
is it just me or is the crowd
in here getting younger?

08:55.800 --> 08:58.400
No, the crowd's the same age
it's always been.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.000
You, on the other hand, are not.

09:02.000 --> 09:02.800
I'm not old.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.500
40's the new 30, right?

09:05.700 --> 09:07.700
Not the way you live, pal.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.500
Yeah, well, guess what?

09:09.600 --> 09:11.700
Not tipping is the new tipping.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.900
I gotta do more
drinking at home.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.800
You didn't call.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.900
Did you follow me here?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.400
Please. If you're not home
and you're not on a date,

09:23.500 --> 09:24.700
where else would you be?

09:25.300 --> 09:27.000
And, yes,
I followed you here.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.900
There's something
I need to tell you.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.600
What can I get you?

09:31.700 --> 09:33.300
Grain alcohol, please.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.600
We don't have grain alcohol.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.900
Okay, just a Sprite.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.900
What do you want, Rose?

09:42.400 --> 09:43.600
I don'want anything.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.400
I st have some news
to share with you.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.300
Is this CNN kind of news,

09:48.400 --> 09:50.000
or something you heard
from a friendly blue jay

09:50.100 --> 09:51.200
with a top hat and a cane?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.900
If you recall,
that was a crow,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.500
and he was wearing a derby
and safety goggl.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.200
And I've admitted that
was a medication issue.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.700
Fine, whatever.
What's the news?

10:03.700 --> 10:06.200
Well, my family has business
interests in London,

10:06.900 --> 10:09.000
and I'm going to move
there and take a job.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.200
Oh, terrific.

10:10.300 --> 10:12.200
So will you be running
the chocolate factory?

10:13.300 --> 10:15.400
Did the OompaLoompas
drop the ball?

10:15.500 --> 10:18.000
Charlie...
The little bastards
went union, didn't they?

10:19.100 --> 10:21.800
Oh,I'm going to miss that
good-natured cynicism.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.300
You're probably wondering
why I decided to leave.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.800
Actually, I was wondering

10:26.900 --> 10:26.900
what possessed them

10:29.600 --> 10:31.500
Gene Wilder was perfect.

10:32.300 --> 10:35.400
I'm leaving because I'm
not getting any younger

10:35.900 --> 10:37.800
and our relationship
isn't really progressing

10:37.900 --> 10:39.500
along the path
I'd hoped for.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.300
Rose, there is
no relationship.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.800
There is no path.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.100
How very Zen of you.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.800
I'll always love you,
Charlie.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.800
But this is best
for both of us.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.600
Yeah. Right.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.300
Okay, well, have a good trip.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.800
Say hi to the Queen...

11:05.000 --> 11:06.300
of Hearts.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.100
Is your friend leaving?

11:08.200 --> 11:10.200
Nono, she never leaves.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.400
She's probably climbing into
the trunk of my car as we speak.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.800
Hey, maybe you should follow me
home to make sure I'm safe.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.900
I don't think my husband
woulapprove.

11:19.300 --> 11:20.700
When did you get married?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.500
Shortly after the last time
I woke up in your bed

11:23.600 --> 11:26.000
with cab fare
taped to my forehead.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.300
I suddenly realized how empty
and soulless my life had become.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.100
Thank you for that, by the way.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.000
Happy to help.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.900
How are you doing tonight?

11:45.600 --> 11:47.000
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, sir.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.000
I don't have daddy issues.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.500
???

11:57.700 --> 12:00.300
he announces that he's leaving
me for the wedding planner.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.200
Ouch!

12:01.300 --> 12:02.100
I was heartsick.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.700
I really cared for him.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.000
Well, of course
you cared for him.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.500
Why else would you
agree to marry him?

12:06.600 --> 12:08.600
No, I mean
the wedding planner.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.600
Ouch. Well, we all have one
or two heartbreaks in our life.

12:14.000 --> 12:14.600
Eight.

12:15.100 --> 12:15.600
Excuse me?

12:15.700 --> 12:17.300
I've been dumped
eight times.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.600
Married, married, gay,
parole violation,

12:20.700 --> 12:24.100
gay and married, deported,
returned to the priesthood,

12:24.200 --> 12:26.400
and woman in a man's body.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.500
Whoa. And yet you
haven't given up.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.400
Of course not.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.100
I may have to kiss
a lot of frogs,

12:33.200 --> 12:35.300
but eventually
I'll find my prince.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.600
Ribbit.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.700
I knew it. You're gay.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.700
No, no. I'm not gay.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.700
Well, whatever it is,

12:44.800 --> 12:46.500
I don't have the time
or the strength
to deal with it.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.700
Beverly, wait. Wait.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.100
You know my loser brother?

12:51.200 --> 12:52.400
I'm him.

12:52.600 --> 12:53.400
What?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.100
This is Charlie's house.

12:55.500 --> 12:59.900
After my divorce,
I was broke, and he took me in.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.100
And I'm not the chiropractor
to the stars.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.800
I mostly handle
slip-and-fall insurance claims.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.200
That's all?

13:08.700 --> 13:09.800
What do you mean,
"That's all?"?

13:09.900 --> 13:12.400
I mean, married,
married, gay,
parole violation...

13:12.500 --> 13:14.100
Alan, you're a catch.

13:15.100 --> 13:15.700
I am?

13:15.800 --> 13:17.700
Come on. You're single,
you're straight,

13:17.800 --> 13:19.500
and you're a genetic male.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.200
So I guess
the bar's not that high.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.500
Have you done
much online dating?

13:24.600 --> 13:27.000
You cleared it with
a penis and a job.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.100
And, just to put
your mind at ease,

13:30.400 --> 13:32.300
I plan on keeping
both of them.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.200
Hey, Berta, you want
to hear something cool?

13:38.300 --> 13:41.100
The ancient Romans had a place
called a vomitorium

13:41.200 --> 13:43.000
where people could eat
as much as they wanted,

13:43.100 --> 13:44.800
puke, and then eat some more.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.900
Well, just like The Sizzler.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.700
Hey. Morning, buddy.

13:50.800 --> 13:51.900
You suck.

13:52.800 --> 13:56.200
Whoa. Has the little prince
not taken his morning poop yet?

13:57.000 --> 13:59.300
It's your fault
that Rose is moving away.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.000
Oh, did she tell you that?

14:01.200 --> 14:03.000
Jake, she's not going anywhere.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.400
This is just one of her games
to mess with my head.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.600
Berta, tell him.

14:07.400 --> 14:12.000
Jake, honey, your
Uncle Charlie sucks.

14:12.700 --> 14:13.800
Come on, Berta.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.800
Hey, if you weren't
such a self-centered pud,

14:15.900 --> 14:17.600
you'd realize
what an angel she is,

14:17.700 --> 14:18.500
and y'd never let her go.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.700
Okay, first of all,
she's not an angel.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.700
Second of all,
she's not leaving.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.300
And third, and perhaps
most important, "pud"?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.500
I cleaned it up for the kid.

14:30.700 --> 14:33.500
* The ninth
or tenth time around. *

14:34.200 --> 14:35.200
Good morning,
everybody.

14:36.800 --> 14:37.800
What's going on?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.500
Rose is moving to London.

14:39.700 --> 14:40.700
She is? Why?

14:40.800 --> 14:42.700
'Cause Uncle Charlie is a pud.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.100
A "pud"?

14:45.100 --> 14:46.800
I cleaned it up for myself.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.700
Hey, Dad, can we go to Sizzl?

14:54.700 --> 14:55.800
This is nice, huh?

14:56.100 --> 14:56.900
Yeah.

14:57.900 --> 15:01.300
Listen, can I tell
you a little secret?

15:01.400 --> 15:02.100
Sure.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.000
It's kind
of embarrassing.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.500
Hey, you can
tell me anything.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.000
All right. Well, before
I came over tonight,

15:10.100 --> 15:14.700
I... put a toothbrush
in my pue.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.200
What's so embarrassing
about that?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.400
I don't go anywhere
without floss.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.300
In fact, sometimes
I'll snap off 18 inches

15:23.400 --> 15:25.500
and tuck it in my pocket
in case, you know,
I have a stubborn...

15:25.600 --> 15:26.200
Oh!

15:27.600 --> 15:30.800
You mean you and me? Tonight?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.500
Unless you
don't want to.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.800
Want to? I'm almost done.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.300
You know, Alan,

15:39.600 --> 15:40.800
I've been thinking about it,

15:41.000 --> 15:42.400
and Rose really
crossed the line

15:42.500 --> 15:44.300
when she told Jake that crap
about her moving away.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.300
Uh... yeah, listen.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.200
Kids take that stuff seriously,
you know?

15:47.300 --> 15:48.300
I know, but...

15:48.400 --> 15:49.500
It's one thing to screw with me.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.100
It's another thing
to screw with a child.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.900
No argument, but
don't you think

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
this is a conversation
you should have with her?

15:55.200 --> 15:57.200
You're right. I'm going
to settle this right now.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.100
Rose, climb up here!
I want to talk to you!

16:03.700 --> 16:05.800
Are you sure you're
the loser brother?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.900
That's always
been the consensus.

16:08.500 --> 16:09.400
Excuse me.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.100
Come on, Rose,
you crazy bitch!

16:11.200 --> 16:12.500
I know you're
out there!

16:13.800 --> 16:14.800
Uh, uh, Charlie?

16:15.000 --> 16:15.600
What do you
want me to do?

16:15.700 --> 16:16.900
Beg you to stay?

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
I hate to interrupt,
but I'm making some
real headway in there,

16:20.100 --> 16:21.400
and you're kind of
ruining the mood.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.000
Not now, Alan.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.400
I'm not going to beg you

16:24.500 --> 16:26.100
'cause you're
not going anywhere!

16:26.200 --> 16:28.600
I know you're not leaving,
and you know you're not leaving!

16:28.700 --> 16:31.000
Charlie, that lovely lady
in there brought her toothbrush

16:31.100 --> 16:33.000
'cause I have a penis and a job.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.000
Rose!

16:35.600 --> 16:37.500
How is she going
to brush your job?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.000
No, you don't
understand.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.200
I don't have time
for this, Alan.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.000
Charlie, are you okay?

16:45.100 --> 16:47.800
Yeah. I just can't
find my damn stalker

16:48.500 --> 16:49.900
He can't find his stalker?

16:50.700 --> 16:52.300
They're usually
in the last place you look.

16:53.900 --> 16:55.100
But enough about him.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.000
If you will accompany me
to the boudoir,

16:58.100 --> 17:00.300
I will convert
an ordinary
pull-out couch

17:00.400 --> 17:02.100
into a magic
carpet for two.

17:02.700 --> 17:04.099
Are you sure you're not gay?

17:04.700 --> 17:06.099
I'm literate
and urbane.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.000
You're not the first
one to be confused.

17:16.599 --> 17:17.500
Right address.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.200
Oh, Charlie,
you came to say good-bye.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.599
Unbelievable.

17:28.099 --> 17:30.200
You're going to play this
all the way out to the end.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.800
Play what out?

17:32.400 --> 17:34.600
All right. Fine.
We'll do it your way.

17:35.900 --> 17:39.000
Rose, you're a terrific woman,

17:39.300 --> 17:41.500
I'm an idiot
for not seeing it,

17:42.400 --> 17:44.300
and I really don't
want you to leave.

17:44.800 --> 17:45.600
Really?

17:45.700 --> 17:47.600
Yeah. Here, look.

17:53.800 --> 17:54.700
See?

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Oh, yeah.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.500
Well, that's my cab.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.600
Good-bye.
Wait. Wait.
What the hell are you doing?

18:03.400 --> 18:04.100
I'm leaving.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.400
Don't you understand?

18:05.500 --> 18:07.100
You can drop the act.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.600
I give up.

18:08.800 --> 18:09.900
I surrender.

18:10.500 --> 18:13.400
You win, Rose. I'm yours.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.400
Oh, Charlie,
that's so sweet.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.400
But I know you,
and you're just

18:18.500 --> 18:19.800
having a little
panic attack

18:19.900 --> 18:21.800
because you're
getting old and
nobody loves you.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.000
<i>See? You get me.</i>

18:24.800 --> 18:28.000
I do, whh is why
I have to leave.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.400
Good-bye, Charlie.

18:35.100 --> 18:38.800
Oh, I almost forgot.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.800
I thought you
should have this.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
It's our first
restraining order.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.600
Look how shaky
your signature was.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.900
You were so spooked.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.200
Oop! Got a plane
to catch.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.600
Oh, come on, Rose! Stop it!

19:09.500 --> 19:12.600
All right, fine.
Take your little cab ride.

19:13.300 --> 19:14.600
See you tomorrow.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.000
Okay.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.300
Maybe not tomorrow.

19:57.200 --> 19:58.800
Aw, damn.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.100
Hey, Charlie.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.200
Oh, hi. Where's Alan?

20:08.300 --> 20:10.500
In the bedroom.
I have to get up
early for work.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.300
Right. Well, see you.

20:12.400 --> 20:13.000
Bye.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.300
Hey, Beverly?

20:17.500 --> 20:20.400
I'm really glad you
and Alan got together.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.900
It's... it's nice.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.000
Thank you.

20:24.500 --> 20:29.700
I hope things work out
for you and your... stalker.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.500
Her name is Rose.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.800
Like the flower.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.800
Okey-dokey.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.700
See? It's on
our restraining order.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.200
Uh-huh. Good night now.

20:53.900 --> 20:54.900
Hey, Alan?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.900
I'm not decent

21:00.300 --> 21:01.900
Rose is really gone.

21:02.600 --> 21:03.200
What?

21:05.100 --> 21:06.700
I said Rose is gone.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.400
And I feel awful.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.400
Like maybe
I made a huge mistake.

21:20.900 --> 21:25.000
Well, we all make mistakes.

21:26.300 --> 21:32.300
