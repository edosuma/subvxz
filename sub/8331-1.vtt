00:31.199 --> 00:32.759
Turn around.

00:34.975 --> 00:36.404
Turn around.

00:36.862 --> 00:40.473
Turn the car around
and get the hell out of here.

00:41.598 --> 00:43.289
Right now.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.750
Don't go back.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.435
Do not go back there.

01:42.300 --> 01:45.399
Hey! Hey!

02:16.667 --> 02:18.576
What the hell's going on here?

04:39.382 --> 04:41.421
You stole my story.

04:42.965 --> 04:44.373
Well?

04:44.534 --> 04:46.736
I'm sorry. Do l--?

04:47.764 --> 04:49.358
-I don't know you.
-I know that.

04:49.525 --> 04:52.690
That doesn't matter. I know you,
Mr. Rainey, that's what matters.

04:52.854 --> 04:54.195
You stole my story.

04:54.933 --> 04:57.006
You're mistaken.
I don't read manuscripts.

04:57.173 --> 05:00.369
You read this one already.
You stole it.

05:00.725 --> 05:01.936
I can assure you that l--

05:02.102 --> 05:04.467
I know you can. I know that.
I don't want to be assured.

05:05.043 --> 05:09.299
If you want to talk to someone about
some grievance you feel you have...

05:09.460 --> 05:14.512
-...call my literary agent in New York.
-This is between you and me.

05:16.692 --> 05:21.743
We don't need outsiders, Mr. Rainey.
It is strictly between you and me.

05:22.291 --> 05:25.161
All right, look, mister,
whoever you are...

05:25.332 --> 05:27.787
...I don't like being accused
of plagiarism...

05:27.956 --> 05:30.825
...if that's what you're accusing me of.
Chico, inside.

05:30.996 --> 05:34.127
I don't blame you for not liking it,
but you did it.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.536
You stole my story.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.937
-Leave. I have nothing more to say.
-Yeah, I'll go.

05:38.803 --> 05:40.428
We'll talk more later.

05:40.596 --> 05:42.024
I'm not taking that.

05:42.195 --> 05:45.708
Won't do you any good to
play games with me, Mr. Rainey.

05:46.451 --> 05:47.880
This has got to be settled.

05:48.051 --> 05:49.961
So far as I'm concerned, it is.

07:06.448 --> 07:07.877
"Sowing Season.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.670
John Shooter."

07:16.304 --> 07:18.127
Never heard of you, pal.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.252
Never heard of your story.

07:38.863 --> 07:40.424
Now...

07:42.862 --> 07:44.586
...where was l?

08:13.453 --> 08:15.559
I'm open to suggestions.

08:24.814 --> 08:27.148
If you don't go and bite her,
I'll kill her.

08:33.453 --> 08:36.006
"Four days after George had
confirmed to his satisfaction...

08:36.173 --> 08:38.148
...that his wife was cheating on him,
he confront--"

08:38.316 --> 08:39.842
This is just bad writing.

08:45.261 --> 08:46.854
Just bad writing.

08:47.117 --> 08:48.775
So you know what to do.

08:49.261 --> 08:50.603
Just do it.

08:55.212 --> 08:57.700
No bad writing.

09:01.548 --> 09:03.142
I think that solves it.

09:27.626 --> 09:30.441
Oh, I found one of your stories
in the trash, Mr. Rainey.

09:30.602 --> 09:33.418
I thought you might want it,
so I put it on the table.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.329
Yeah, I see that, Mrs. Garvey.

09:50.922 --> 09:53.639
"Todd Downey thought that a woman
who would steal your love...

09:53.802 --> 09:57.479
...when your love was really all you
had, was not much of a woman.

09:57.642 --> 09:59.715
He, therefore, decided to kill her.

10:00.171 --> 10:02.079
He would bury her in
the deep corner formed...

10:02.249 --> 10:05.413
... where the house and the barn
came together at an extreme angle.

10:05.577 --> 10:07.966
He would bury her where
his wife kept her garden.

10:08.138 --> 10:10.211
The garden she loved
more than she loved him. "

10:10.377 --> 10:12.003
Oh, shit. Oh, sh--

10:13.290 --> 10:16.639
Thank God. From the sound of you,
I didn't know what to think.

10:16.809 --> 10:18.566
Let me get this. That's my job.

10:18.730 --> 10:20.834
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Garvey.
I really am.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.205
I'll take care of this.
Go on back to work.

10:23.369 --> 10:25.408
-I didn't write this.
-Oh, I thought you did.

10:25.576 --> 10:30.049
No, it's not mine. Look, it says John
Shooter right there. It's not me.

10:30.218 --> 10:32.639
Oh, I thought it was one of those...

10:32.809 --> 10:34.719
...whatchamacallums,
pseudo-names or "-nyms."

10:34.889 --> 10:37.539
No. No, I never used one.
I've never used one.

10:37.704 --> 10:41.959
Oh, I can't imagine why you would.
I mean, hide behind a made-up name.

10:42.120 --> 10:47.008
No. Mrs. Garvey, what I'm trying to tell
you is that someone else wrote this.

10:47.176 --> 10:49.151
Oh. Okey dokey, then.

11:12.903 --> 11:15.325
"A woman who'd steal your love
when your love was all you had...

11:15.495 --> 11:17.021
...wasn't much of a woman.

11:17.191 --> 11:19.461
That, at least,
was Tommy Haverlock's opinion.

11:19.624 --> 11:21.052
He decided to kill her.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.973
He even knew the place he would
bury her. The exact place.

11:24.135 --> 11:26.622
The little patch of garden
she kept in the extreme angle...

11:26.791 --> 11:29.824
...formed where the old and new parts
of the house came together.

11:29.990 --> 11:33.154
He'd bury her in the garden she loved
more than she loved him. "

11:34.598 --> 11:36.606
Come to the flea market with me.
It'll be fun.

11:37.095 --> 11:40.410
We've got to get rid of some of
this stuff. Look at this, it's awful.

11:41.255 --> 11:42.913
No wonder they left it.

11:45.255 --> 11:47.490
Oh, my God, look, there's a window.

11:48.934 --> 11:51.105
It's a secret window.

11:52.677 --> 11:54.500
Oh, this is perfect.

11:54.822 --> 11:56.316
I'm gonna put my garden
right there.

11:57.381 --> 12:00.993
It's a secret window, and it'll look down
on a secret garden.

12:27.941 --> 12:29.283
Shit.

13:05.891 --> 13:07.101
I didn't steal it.

13:09.475 --> 13:10.685
What?

13:13.092 --> 13:15.033
Mr. Rainey?

13:15.618 --> 13:16.895
I'm all done.

13:17.059 --> 13:18.400
Really? So soon? Well...

13:20.642 --> 13:22.977
-...I'll see you next time.
-Mr. Rainey...

13:23.139 --> 13:24.633
...there's something I want to say.

13:24.962 --> 13:28.279
Some women don't know
a good thing when they got it.

13:29.186 --> 13:33.114
They don't know they got the whole
world right in front of their nose.

13:33.281 --> 13:35.005
There. That's it.

13:35.938 --> 13:38.240
Not another word from me.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.708
Mr. Rainey?

13:44.739 --> 13:46.233
Can I make you something to eat?

13:46.402 --> 13:48.824
No. I ate. Well, earlier.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.223
I'm going to eat later.
And I'll make it myself.

13:52.386 --> 13:54.589
You're a good man, Mr. Rainey.

13:54.753 --> 13:55.997
You too, Mrs. Garvey.

14:05.282 --> 14:09.306
It's my personal business,
Mrs. Garvey. Thank you very much.

14:09.472 --> 14:11.677
My pillows now.

14:11.905 --> 14:14.971
Her sticky, weird fingers
on my privacy.

14:17.984 --> 14:20.123
I didn't steal that story.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.723
I don't think.

15:15.198 --> 15:17.566
-Hello?
-Hello, Mort.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.116
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm all right.

15:21.278 --> 15:23.515
-Why wouldn't I be all right?
-I don't know.

15:23.902 --> 15:26.772
You're up there alone. Anything could
happen and nobody would know.

15:26.942 --> 15:29.082
-I'd know.
-Right.

15:29.247 --> 15:32.988
How's my little baby puppy? Did
Chico get those cataracts removed?

15:33.151 --> 15:35.190
Why did you call, Amy?
What do you want?

15:35.357 --> 15:37.244
I had one of those feelings I get.

15:37.406 --> 15:39.991
I know you think they're stupid
and you don't believe them...

15:40.157 --> 15:41.335
...but I believe them.

15:41.501 --> 15:45.843
I was making a sandwich and I had a
sensation that you might not be okay.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.185
I held off as long as possible.

15:48.350 --> 15:51.285
But then I couldn't anymore,
so here I am.

15:51.454 --> 15:54.235
Well, I don't know what to tell you
except I'm fine.

15:54.716 --> 15:56.440
Nothing weird happened or anything?

16:00.157 --> 16:01.979
Do you remember "Secret Window"?

16:02.141 --> 16:03.318
What?

16:03.484 --> 16:07.827
My story. You know, the one where
the woman has the garden...

16:07.997 --> 16:10.070
...and then the guy has the shovel.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.604
-Not one of my favorites.
-That's good to know.

16:12.765 --> 16:14.674
Well, it was kind of hostile,
don't you think?

16:14.845 --> 16:17.562
Gee, I miss your constructive criticism.
I really do.

16:17.725 --> 16:18.969
What about the story, Mort?

16:19.133 --> 16:21.500
I was just wondering,
do you think it's possible...

16:21.661 --> 16:26.069
...that I might have been influenced
by anybody or anything at that time?

16:26.301 --> 16:27.730
Other than Jack Daniel's?

16:28.380 --> 16:30.868
I know that part, Amy,
hence the question.

16:31.036 --> 16:32.213
I don't know.

16:32.379 --> 16:35.413
You got weird on that one.
You'd write it mostly at night, I think.

16:36.316 --> 16:39.034
-What do you mean, "influenced"?
-I don't know.

16:39.197 --> 16:40.571
Like, by another story?

16:40.732 --> 16:42.870
Look, forget it.

16:43.067 --> 16:46.744
Mort, you swore the one time
was the only time.

16:46.907 --> 16:49.241
Forget it, please.
Please, just forget it. Come on.

16:50.203 --> 16:51.381
How's T ed?

16:52.251 --> 16:53.778
He's fine.

16:54.395 --> 16:57.657
I was thinking that he and I should get
together sometime, have a drink...

16:57.851 --> 17:00.120
...because we've been to a lot
of the same places.

17:00.378 --> 17:02.550
-You know what? I gotta go.
-So do l.

17:04.377 --> 17:05.807
Okay.

17:05.978 --> 17:07.701
-ls he there?
-No.

17:07.866 --> 17:09.076
We're not together.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.728
Wow, well...

17:13.657 --> 17:16.973
...I'd be lying if I said I wasn't on
the verge of doing Snoopy dances.

17:17.146 --> 17:18.902
No, Mort.

17:20.442 --> 17:22.863
What I meant was we're
not together at the moment.

17:23.034 --> 17:27.790
He's coming over later. He hardly ever
comes here. I usually go to his house.

17:28.473 --> 17:30.961
There's a useful detail.
Thanks for that.

17:31.130 --> 17:33.432
Don't ask, then.
It was working just fine that way.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.765
I think you should have him
over to the house more.

17:35.931 --> 17:39.224
Such a nice house. I like it.
I mean, I love it. That's why I bought it.

17:39.769 --> 17:40.980
Goodbye, Mort.

17:42.009 --> 17:43.699
Goodbye, Amy.

17:48.633 --> 17:53.204
Shit. Shit. Shit.
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

18:10.968 --> 18:13.618
-You read it?
-I did.

18:13.783 --> 18:16.598
I imagine it rang a bell, didn't it?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.735
Oh, it certainly did.

18:19.224 --> 18:20.653
When did you write it?

18:20.824 --> 18:22.711
I thought you'd ask that.

18:22.872 --> 18:24.082
That's the whole point.

18:24.248 --> 18:27.543
Two writers have the same story,
it's all about who wrote the words first.

18:27.704 --> 18:29.843
-Wouldn't you say that's true?
-I suppose so.

18:30.008 --> 18:33.269
I suppose that's why I came
all the way up here from Mississippi.

18:41.848 --> 18:45.589
I wrote it seven years ago, 1 997.

18:45.911 --> 18:47.319
How'd you get it?

18:47.512 --> 18:49.420
That's what I really want to know.

18:49.590 --> 18:53.071
How in the hell did a big
money-scribbling asshole like you...

18:53.239 --> 18:55.760
...get down to a little shitsplat town
in Mississippi...

18:55.926 --> 18:58.479
...and steal my goddamn story?

18:58.647 --> 19:00.306
-Drop it.
-Drop it?

19:00.470 --> 19:03.700
Drop it. What in the hell
do you mean, drop it?

19:04.471 --> 19:08.431
You said you wrote your story in 1 997.
I wrote mine in late '94.

19:08.599 --> 19:11.914
It was published for the first time
in June 1 995 in a magazine.

19:12.086 --> 19:14.803
Nice try, Mr. Shooter,
but I beat you by two years.

19:14.966 --> 19:17.171
If anybody's got a bitch about
plagiarism, it's me.

19:17.558 --> 19:19.151
You lie!

19:19.446 --> 19:21.934
-No, I don't!
-Prove it!

19:22.102 --> 19:24.075
I don't have to prove a thing to you.

19:24.245 --> 19:28.500
Go look for yourself. Ellery Queen's
Mystery Magazine, June 1 995.

19:28.661 --> 19:31.596
-And how am I supposed to find that?
-That's not my problem.

19:31.765 --> 19:35.628
Am I supposed to drive down to your
house in Riverdale, New York...

19:35.797 --> 19:38.546
...and ask your wife, Amy, for it?

19:39.510 --> 19:41.331
I read it on your book jacket.

19:42.644 --> 19:44.074
That's not my house. That's hers.

19:44.245 --> 19:45.488
What the hell does that mean?

19:45.652 --> 19:49.035
What do you think, you ignorant hick?
I'm in the middle of a divorce.

19:49.205 --> 19:53.035
D-l-V-O-R-C-E. Divorce.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.924
You strike me as the kind of guy...

19:56.085 --> 20:00.394
...who's on the lookout for a head
he can knock off with a shovel.

20:00.563 --> 20:04.492
But what you don't understand is,
if we do start to fight...

20:05.716 --> 20:07.691
...it's not going to end...

20:07.860 --> 20:10.578
...until one or the other of us
is dead.

20:14.964 --> 20:18.346
Hold your water,
I'm just getting my smokes.

20:19.539 --> 20:20.717
I don't smoke.

20:20.883 --> 20:22.410
I'll give you three days.

20:22.579 --> 20:26.092
Call your ex and get her to send you
the magazine with your story in it...

20:26.259 --> 20:28.430
...if there is such a magazine...

20:28.595 --> 20:29.872
...and I'll be back.

20:30.036 --> 20:33.516
If I show you, will you go back where
you came from and leave me alone?

20:36.275 --> 20:37.736
Three days.

20:38.483 --> 20:40.818
Always a pleasure to meet a reader.

21:00.722 --> 21:02.478
I don't want to call her.

21:02.994 --> 21:05.928
I want to go to sleep.
I want to take a nap.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.354
Okay. No nap.

21:09.873 --> 21:12.329
I give her a call
about the magazine...

21:12.497 --> 21:15.629
...I go write some crap
for a couple of hours...

21:15.794 --> 21:18.827
...and then I get to take a nap. Right?

21:19.409 --> 21:20.587
Chico?

21:21.841 --> 21:23.783
Chico

21:23.954 --> 21:26.375
Don't be discouraged

21:26.544 --> 21:29.065
All right, go ahead and be
discouraged, you blind bastard.

21:29.233 --> 21:30.181
See if I care.

21:31.952 --> 21:35.400
And returned to the couch...

21:37.137 --> 21:38.861
...in shame...

21:39.377 --> 21:41.264
...degradation...

21:47.792 --> 21:49.199
...and sloth.

21:49.904 --> 21:51.311
Sloth.

24:06.443 --> 24:08.068
Shooter!

24:13.291 --> 24:15.266
I'll get you for this!

24:16.236 --> 24:17.697
You hear me?

24:17.867 --> 24:20.234
I'll get you for this!

24:47.914 --> 24:50.402
Chico? He killed Chico?

24:50.666 --> 24:53.535
Yeah. Last night around 9.
I was asleep.

24:53.706 --> 24:55.462
Look, he left this.

24:56.107 --> 24:59.903
"You have three days.
I'm not joking. No police."

25:00.073 --> 25:02.888
Anytime somebody sits down
and writes "No police"...

25:03.049 --> 25:06.846
...that's exactly the time that a fella
should get himself over to the police.

25:07.017 --> 25:09.287
Yeah, well, that's what I figured.

25:09.449 --> 25:13.159
So, what I've got is a detailed
description of him and his car.

25:13.322 --> 25:16.582
Type a little harder.
You have to get through the carbon.

25:16.745 --> 25:18.468
I didn't get the license plate number...

25:18.633 --> 25:22.626
...but I'm sure it had Mississippi tags,
and I think that it started with an A.

25:22.792 --> 25:24.101
That's what I see in my mind.

25:24.264 --> 25:28.388
Needlepoint. Can you believe it?
Doc says it's good for the arthritis.

25:30.249 --> 25:33.182
Anyway, anything you can find out
about this guy, I'd appreciate it.

25:33.351 --> 25:36.668
I must cut quite an intimidating
law-enforcement figure, huh?

25:38.088 --> 25:42.660
I'd like to know what I'm dealing with.
Maybe he has a violent history.

25:43.081 --> 25:46.211
Maybe you can find him, talk to him.
I think that would be better.

25:46.376 --> 25:48.962
So you got yourself a member
of the crazy folks tribe?

25:50.471 --> 25:52.861
Yeah. I mean, they pop up
every once in a while.

25:53.032 --> 25:55.878
I suppose it's just the price
of selling a few books.

25:56.903 --> 25:58.463
Sorry.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.623
Here's the.... Here's that description.

26:02.792 --> 26:05.476
Of course, killing an animal
isn't like killing a man.

26:05.991 --> 26:07.997
I'm not even sure it's a crime,
come to think.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.272
Come on, it's gotta be.
What about animal cruelty?

26:10.439 --> 26:12.805
What about destruction
of private property? What about--?

26:12.966 --> 26:14.625
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe.

26:15.239 --> 26:16.700
Okay.

26:17.383 --> 26:20.383
First thing I'm going to need
is a description.

26:22.631 --> 26:24.735
Tell me the truth. Did you steal it?

26:24.902 --> 26:26.363
What? No!

26:26.534 --> 26:29.349
Kind of an amazing coincidence,
don't you think?

26:29.510 --> 26:31.168
The stories being so much alike?

26:31.335 --> 26:34.814
Obviously he copied me. Would you
like to choose a side before we go on?

26:34.982 --> 26:37.536
I'm on your side.
But I still need to know the truth.

26:37.702 --> 26:39.458
Which kind of situation is this?

26:39.622 --> 26:43.363
Is he a regular wacko like you've had
before, in which case I can help...

26:43.525 --> 26:45.892
...or something you should talk
to your lawyer about?

26:46.053 --> 26:49.763
No, this guy is just simply
out of his mind. That's all it is.

26:49.926 --> 26:51.965
Fine. Okay.

26:52.133 --> 26:53.694
What do you want me to do?

26:53.862 --> 26:56.480
I want you to help me
in the same way that--

26:57.445 --> 27:01.667
In the same way that you did before.

27:01.828 --> 27:03.454
He wasn't this crazy.

27:03.621 --> 27:05.508
That guy was just
an obsessed reader...

27:05.668 --> 27:08.702
...who couldn't tell real life from
the crap you make up for a living.

27:08.869 --> 27:10.243
No offense.

27:10.501 --> 27:12.956
Now, this Shooter guy,
he threaten your life?

27:13.829 --> 27:16.895
-He put a screwdriver through my dog.
-Well, he did break a law...

27:17.061 --> 27:19.963
...but it doesn't seem to be a
very important law in Tashmore Lake.

27:20.132 --> 27:22.620
The sheriff must be a cat person.

27:22.788 --> 27:24.730
Yeah, well, I don't exactly feel safe...

27:24.901 --> 27:27.999
...with a 70-year-old arthritic sheriff
watching my back.

27:28.164 --> 27:29.953
Are you gonna help me or not?

27:30.116 --> 27:31.293
Let's see...

27:31.844 --> 27:35.804
...I got a corporate loyalty thing
I got to be back for on Friday...

27:35.971 --> 27:37.859
...but I can give you
a couple of days.

27:38.212 --> 27:39.640
Okay.

27:39.811 --> 27:42.146
My story came out a couple years...

27:43.363 --> 27:46.626
...before he says he wrote his.

27:46.788 --> 27:48.762
I've got a copy of the original
at Amy's house.

27:48.932 --> 27:51.420
I was just gonna stop by
on my way upstate and pick it up.

27:51.588 --> 27:53.790
-Amy's house?
-Yeah.

27:53.954 --> 27:56.856
-Amy and I split up six months ago.
-I'm sorry.

27:57.763 --> 27:58.973
Yeah, me too.

27:59.139 --> 28:00.732
-Amicable?
-Not remotely.

28:00.899 --> 28:04.314
What happened? You finally nail one
of your groupies at a book signing?

28:04.483 --> 28:06.370
The Omaha Barnes and Noble?

28:11.618 --> 28:14.553
That was a dick thing to say,
you know? Rotten profession.

28:15.330 --> 28:16.737
I apologize.

28:17.475 --> 28:20.092
-You were saying?
-I was saying...

28:20.737 --> 28:25.495
...that if it's just proof that this guy
wants, fine. I show him the magazine.

28:25.667 --> 28:27.771
But I think maybe you should
be with me when I do.

28:27.937 --> 28:29.214
No shit,
I'm gonna be with you.

28:29.665 --> 28:32.535
-You remember my rate?
-Yeah. An obscene fortune, right?

28:32.929 --> 28:35.897
You'll see a black Cadillac in the
driveway tonight when you get home.

28:36.066 --> 28:38.334
Don't freak out,
it's me keeping an eye on things.

28:38.497 --> 28:39.840
Okay.

28:40.002 --> 28:42.871
Get a good night's sleep.
You don't look too hot.

29:20.255 --> 29:23.638
This is not my beautiful house.

29:24.544 --> 29:27.840
This is not my beautiful wife.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.830
Anymore.

30:41.021 --> 30:44.404
-You scared the shit out of me.
-Hey, I'm sorry about that.

30:44.574 --> 30:46.941
This last week must have
finally caught up with me.

30:47.102 --> 30:49.489
-That's very reassuring. Thanks.
-Hey, relax, Hemingway.

30:49.660 --> 30:51.668
I was only out 1 0 minutes,
swear to God.

30:51.837 --> 30:54.073
Already checked the place.
Everything is fine.

30:54.236 --> 30:56.571
Just waiting for you to get back
to let you know.

30:59.101 --> 31:01.272
You think you'll be
sticking around tonight, or...?

31:01.437 --> 31:04.307
No. Not unless you want me to.

31:05.980 --> 31:08.315
No. No.

31:08.476 --> 31:11.824
No, I'm sure it's fine in there.

31:13.373 --> 31:14.714
Nope.

31:15.451 --> 31:16.914
No monsters up here.

31:17.084 --> 31:18.491
Did you check under my bed?

31:18.652 --> 31:20.081
Even in your toy chest.

31:20.251 --> 31:23.415
I'll be back in the morning.
Start asking around town.

31:23.579 --> 31:25.522
What the hell you gonna
do with that, sailor?

31:25.692 --> 31:28.146
Find out who else saw your nut-job.

31:28.315 --> 31:29.843
Tom Greenleaf.

31:31.964 --> 31:34.615
Tom Greenleaf passed by
when I was talking to Shooter.

31:34.780 --> 31:37.529
He waved at us, so he must have
gotten a good look at him.

31:37.691 --> 31:40.212
Tom Greenleaf.
How do I get ahold of him?

31:40.380 --> 31:42.483
Bowie's store,
breakfast every morning, 9 a.m.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.690
Okay, I got it. Don't worry.

31:44.891 --> 31:47.608
Once I find out where
this Shooter's staying...

31:47.771 --> 31:51.830
...I'll stop in for a little freak-me-out
chat. Use the word "we" a lot.

31:51.995 --> 31:56.152
"We know what you're doing. We want
it to stop. We're watching you."

31:56.635 --> 32:00.146
Trust me, he'll hit the road so hard,
it'll hit back.

32:02.330 --> 32:05.495
Hey. You know what?
Are you staying in town tonight?

32:05.659 --> 32:07.568
Yeah, some motel out by Route 9.

32:07.738 --> 32:10.870
Irv's Lakesider, I think it's called.
You know the place?

32:13.498 --> 32:15.255
-Yeah, I know the place.
-Okay.

32:15.419 --> 32:16.694
Good night.

32:50.297 --> 32:51.506
Hello?

33:00.216 --> 33:01.623
Shit.

34:35.797 --> 34:37.835
I know you're in there, shithead!

34:41.972 --> 34:44.786
If you don't come out
by the time I count to five...

34:46.164 --> 34:47.920
...I'm gonna come in swinging.

34:53.460 --> 34:54.833
One.

34:56.404 --> 34:58.029
Two!

35:06.899 --> 35:08.525
I killed a mirror.

35:15.251 --> 35:17.105
And my shower door.

36:12.274 --> 36:16.365
I don't care. I'm just gonna smoke.
I'm just gonna totally smoke.

36:16.529 --> 36:16.689
I'll finish these, go to the store...

36:16.689 --> 36:18.347
I'll finish these, go to the store...

36:18.513 --> 36:21.578
...get a brand-new pack,
smoke the shit out of that one.

36:42.064 --> 36:44.136
Thought you didn't smoke.

36:49.104 --> 36:51.625
I took it up recently for my health.

36:51.792 --> 36:53.930
How are you, Mr. Rainey?

36:54.609 --> 36:57.389
Oh, I'm just peachy, Mr. Shooter.
How are you?

36:57.550 --> 37:00.966
Well, it sounded like you pitched a fit
or something in there.

37:01.135 --> 37:04.135
I don't think you're really
all that well.

37:04.656 --> 37:09.544
Stealing from another man, that don't
seem to have ever bothered you none.

37:09.903 --> 37:11.561
Being caught up on, though.

37:13.232 --> 37:16.427
Or maybe it's just that
successful writers like you...

37:16.591 --> 37:19.820
...throw tantrums when things
don't go the way they expect.

37:20.366 --> 37:22.189
Why didn't you get that magazine?

37:22.351 --> 37:25.351
You were down there at
her house today, weren't you?

37:25.743 --> 37:28.808
If I get this story
and I show it to you...

37:29.071 --> 37:31.046
...will you then kindly disappear?

37:31.215 --> 37:35.622
There isn't any magazine
with that story in it, Mr. Rainey.

37:35.790 --> 37:37.416
You and me, we know that.

37:37.742 --> 37:39.466
Okay, then.

37:40.686 --> 37:43.948
What can we do to make you
feel better?

37:50.573 --> 37:52.679
I want you to fix it.

37:53.006 --> 37:54.499
What would you like me to fix?

37:54.669 --> 37:56.524
My ending.

37:56.686 --> 37:58.758
The one you wrecked.

37:59.309 --> 38:01.164
I can't decide what's worse...

38:01.421 --> 38:05.066
...stealing my story
or ruining the ending.

38:05.262 --> 38:06.788
Mine was perfect.

38:07.213 --> 38:09.963
-I don't think I read your whole story.
-Oh, I bet you did.

38:11.085 --> 38:15.078
"'l know I can do it,'
Todd Downey said...

38:15.245 --> 38:19.588
...helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

38:19.756 --> 38:21.218
'I'm sure that in time...

38:21.388 --> 38:25.544
...her death will be a mystery
even to me."'

38:25.708 --> 38:30.410
That's how the story ends, pilgrim.
It's the only ending.

38:30.571 --> 38:33.867
You're going to write it for me
and get it published.

38:34.028 --> 38:36.298
And it's gonna have my name on it.

38:36.461 --> 38:39.242
I'd be more than happy to write your
ending, Mr. Shooter.

38:42.699 --> 38:45.830
Saw that wife of yours
coming out of the house.

38:47.307 --> 38:50.341
-She's purty.
-My wife?

38:50.508 --> 38:52.744
Why don't we just
leave her out of this.

38:54.284 --> 38:56.258
Would if I could...

38:56.428 --> 39:00.136
...but I'm starting to think you ain't
gonna leave me that option.

39:05.067 --> 39:07.456
You want to wake up from
one of your stupid naps...

39:07.627 --> 39:09.928
...and find Amy nailed
to your garbage bin?

39:10.090 --> 39:13.865
Or turn on the radio some morning
and hear she came off second-best...

39:14.026 --> 39:17.375
...in a match with the chain saw
you keep out in the shed?

39:19.146 --> 39:20.575
Do you?

39:22.634 --> 39:24.740
You can't get away with it.

39:28.555 --> 39:29.896
I know what you did...

39:30.058 --> 39:34.531
...and I ain't quitting
until right gets put right.

40:52.103 --> 40:54.524
-ls that you, John Wayne?
-Mort?

40:54.983 --> 40:56.641
Are you there? Mort?

40:56.807 --> 40:59.174
Yes, Amy, I'm here.
Just lower your voice a little.

40:59.335 --> 41:00.645
-What is it?
-Where have you been?

41:00.808 --> 41:03.523
I've been trying to get ahold of you
all night and this morning.

41:03.686 --> 41:04.865
I was asleep.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.234
Oh, great, so you unplugged
the phone?

41:07.878 --> 41:09.439
How may I assist you, Amy?

41:09.607 --> 41:11.200
Oh, God, Mort.

41:11.846 --> 41:13.570
What happened? What?

41:13.735 --> 41:17.214
Someone burned down our house.
That's what happened, okay?

41:17.382 --> 41:20.578
-What?
-Someone burned down our house!

41:39.781 --> 41:41.374
Bye, babe.

41:42.949 --> 41:44.127
Pardon me, miss.

41:44.293 --> 41:47.010
-You left $1 00 on the dresser.
-Shut up!

41:47.173 --> 41:49.410
Surely the escort service told
you I was three.

41:49.574 --> 41:50.915
Please.

41:51.205 --> 41:54.172
Some guys are less, some guys
are 1 00 if you like that kind of thing.

41:54.341 --> 41:57.188
Some guys are less than that,
but I'm three. I happen to be three.

41:57.349 --> 41:59.291
There's something
on your mouth there.

41:59.716 --> 42:01.090
Bye.

42:12.101 --> 42:13.594
Mort!

42:19.492 --> 42:21.531
-Hi.
-Hi.

42:23.716 --> 42:27.065
-I'm really sorry about all this, Amy.
-So am l.

42:27.716 --> 42:29.178
Me too.

42:29.540 --> 42:30.717
Thank you, Ted.

42:30.883 --> 42:33.055
-Mr. and Mrs. Rainey?
-Yes.

42:33.220 --> 42:37.376
-You the owners?
-Yes, we are. We were the owners.

42:37.539 --> 42:40.189
Were the owners?
What do you mean?

42:40.355 --> 42:42.079
You don't own it anymore?

42:42.243 --> 42:44.960
Were Mr. and Mrs. Rainey.
Are the owners.

42:45.123 --> 42:48.089
-I'm Steven Bradley, Riverdale P D.
-How do you do? Ted Milner.

42:48.258 --> 42:50.364
-This is Fire Chief Wickersham.
-Chief.

42:50.531 --> 42:53.792
We won't keep you long. The insurance
investigator needs to see you at 3.

42:53.954 --> 42:57.402
You're victims of arson. The fire was
started by an incendiary device...

42:57.571 --> 43:00.767
...made with a champagne bottle
and a couple of quarts of gasoline.

43:00.930 --> 43:02.556
Oh, that really works, then, eh?

43:02.722 --> 43:04.250
So first question:

43:04.419 --> 43:06.043
Enemies. You got any?

43:06.210 --> 43:08.992
-No. No one.
-No, no. Not a soul.

43:09.761 --> 43:12.250
Bother you if I answer
one or two of these, Ted?

43:12.418 --> 43:14.327
It's okay. It's cool.

43:18.242 --> 43:19.551
Yeah.

43:20.771 --> 43:22.265
I have an enemy.

43:22.690 --> 43:24.893
Sorry I wasn't there to meet you
this morning.

43:25.058 --> 43:30.011
I spent last night poking around the
site with a flashlight and a Polaroid.

43:30.177 --> 43:32.413
Oops. Broke one of my own rules.

43:32.577 --> 43:35.926
I don't like to call it "the site."
It wasn't a site, it was a house.

43:36.097 --> 43:38.781
Your house,
and I'm sorry for your loss.

43:38.946 --> 43:41.465
Thank you very much, Mrs. Evans.

43:41.632 --> 43:44.535
It still says "Mrs."? Fran is fine.

43:45.569 --> 43:46.998
These meetings are hard.

43:47.169 --> 43:49.721
People in your situation
are already upset...

43:49.888 --> 43:51.929
...and quite often
they see an investigator...

43:52.097 --> 43:54.814
...as an accusation that they've
torched their own property.

43:54.977 --> 43:57.465
And in this case, you've given us
a plausible suspect...

43:57.633 --> 44:00.053
...who we'll investigate aggressively
along with the police.

44:00.225 --> 44:03.453
But in the meantime, that's a list of
your claimed insurable property.

44:03.616 --> 44:07.740
Read it and sign an affidavit swearing
that the items still belong to you...

44:07.904 --> 44:10.108
...and that they were inside
when the fire occurred.

44:10.272 --> 44:12.639
I'm told there was a separation
of residence recently...

44:12.800 --> 44:14.655
...so that last bit will be important.

44:14.816 --> 44:16.920
We're going through a divorce.
It's not final yet.

44:17.087 --> 44:19.356
Well, the settlement agreement's
all done.

44:19.519 --> 44:21.243
Everything's been negotiated...

44:21.407 --> 44:24.723
...we're just waiting for it
to be signed by both parties.

44:24.895 --> 44:26.903
I moved out about six months ago...

44:27.071 --> 44:30.300
...and just hadn't gotten around to
hauling all the stuff out yet, so....

44:30.463 --> 44:33.212
Been down that road. Sucks.

44:33.694 --> 44:36.248
These things just have to follow
their natural course.

44:36.895 --> 44:40.790
Things will wrap up when everybody's
ready for that to happen.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.774
That's been my feeling.

44:44.607 --> 44:46.973
In the meantime,
do the best you can with the list.

44:47.134 --> 44:48.542
Thanks.

45:05.150 --> 45:06.973
Do you actually intend
to rubberneck?

45:07.134 --> 45:09.620
I hardly think my concern could be
construed as rubbernecking.

45:09.789 --> 45:10.968
Amy, he's rubbernecking.

45:11.133 --> 45:14.811
I'm not gonna freak out about this,
but, I mean, this is our stuff.

45:14.974 --> 45:16.566
No. All right. He's right.

45:16.733 --> 45:19.002
-This is our stuff.
-He's right. He's right, Ted.

45:19.166 --> 45:23.126
He is right. The law says you have
no right to see the listed items at all.

45:23.294 --> 45:27.449
We wink at things like this if nobody
minds, but it seems Mr. Rainey does.

45:27.612 --> 45:30.133
Yes. Mr. Rainey minds a lot.

45:32.509 --> 45:35.956
Would it help matters
if I took a walk around the block?

45:36.125 --> 45:38.394
-Yes, thanks.
-Sure.

45:39.965 --> 45:42.900
Oh, heck, Ted, live a little.
Make it two.

45:45.148 --> 45:46.675
Rubbernecker.

46:04.668 --> 46:05.845
Mort.

46:06.011 --> 46:08.150
-Wait. I need to ask you something.
-What?

46:08.315 --> 46:13.334
This guy, Shooter. His story. I mean,
is this situation like the other time?

46:13.500 --> 46:16.534
I'm sorry. I wouldn't bring it up,
but it did happen once before.

46:16.700 --> 46:20.048
Look, that is the only time I've ever
done anything remotely like that.

46:20.218 --> 46:23.415
I paid the guy everything he wanted.
Never happened before or since.

46:23.578 --> 46:25.488
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

46:27.803 --> 46:30.170
-Amy.
-What?

46:32.218 --> 46:34.488
Only you, me and the lawyers
know about that, right?

46:34.780 --> 46:36.153
Right.

46:36.314 --> 46:38.583
Because you haven't said
anything to Ted. Surely not.

46:38.746 --> 46:40.023
No.

46:40.314 --> 46:42.616
-Have you said something to Ted?
-Come on!

46:44.250 --> 46:46.038
Well, do I have timing or what?

46:46.202 --> 46:47.610
Yes, you do.

46:47.771 --> 46:50.640
Sorry you had to miss that.
I know how much you like my things.

46:50.810 --> 46:53.363
-Oh, Jesus.
-You and me are gonna have a talk.

46:53.530 --> 46:55.537
Be back in 1 0 minutes.

46:56.794 --> 46:58.648
I'm in trouble.

47:02.618 --> 47:05.880
-I've had enough of your bullshit.
-You're a dick.

47:06.681 --> 47:08.274
Do you feel better?

47:08.441 --> 47:09.686
Yes, I do.

47:09.850 --> 47:13.876
Yeah, look, marriages end.
I'm sorry, but I didn't end yours.

47:14.042 --> 47:15.797
It was done by the time I got there.

47:15.961 --> 47:18.831
Really? You must've thought her
wedding ring was a little strange.

47:19.001 --> 47:22.678
Oh, man. Listen, I apologized
to you months ago.

47:22.841 --> 47:26.867
I know you don't want me in your life.
I don't want you in mine either.

47:27.033 --> 47:30.293
But until this little divorce thing's
done, not much we can do about it.

47:30.456 --> 47:35.313
But I will not let you upset Amy
any more than you already have.

47:35.480 --> 47:39.058
So why don't we just wrap this thing
up and get out of each other's lives--?

47:42.104 --> 47:45.781
Are we getting the message
I'm sending?

47:46.936 --> 47:48.365
Where are we from, Teddy?

47:50.040 --> 47:51.381
Tennessee...

47:52.023 --> 47:53.235
...Morty.

47:55.031 --> 47:56.624
I was gonna say Mississippi.

47:57.336 --> 48:01.744
No. Long way from there.
Little place called Shooter's Bay.

48:21.366 --> 48:22.827
Come on, Karsch.

48:23.030 --> 48:26.227
Five hundred dollars a day.
Where are you when I need you?

48:52.373 --> 48:53.650
What--?

48:55.318 --> 48:57.226
What fresh hell...?

48:57.397 --> 48:59.699
-Yeah?
-Where you been all day?

49:00.661 --> 49:02.351
I might ask you the same question.

49:02.517 --> 49:05.332
Relax, you're fine.
I checked the cabin an hour ago.

49:05.493 --> 49:08.112
Well, he showed up an hour
after you left last night.

49:08.278 --> 49:10.317
Oh, really?
Then he had a busy night.

49:10.677 --> 49:13.547
My office called me about
your Riverdale house. I'm sorry.

49:13.717 --> 49:16.750
The worst part is, I hadn't had
a chance to get the magazine out.

49:16.917 --> 49:18.859
The one with the story he says I stole.

49:19.028 --> 49:20.436
That's gone up in smoke now.

49:20.597 --> 49:23.793
Do you still want to go through with it?
Meeting? Showing him the magazine?

49:23.956 --> 49:25.298
Hell, yes, man.

49:25.461 --> 49:28.810
I've had a shitty year.
I want it settled now. Everything.

49:28.980 --> 49:31.598
Good. I called your agent
when I heard about the house.

49:31.764 --> 49:34.034
I figured he'd have a copy
of the magazine.

49:34.197 --> 49:37.065
He sent the original by UPS
overnight today.

49:37.235 --> 49:38.992
You can pick it up tomorrow after 3.

49:39.156 --> 49:40.781
I knew there was a reason I hired you.

49:40.948 --> 49:42.125
There's something else.

49:42.933 --> 49:45.234
I caught up with your
Tom Greenleaf today.

49:45.396 --> 49:47.949
The guy who drove past you
and Shooter on the lake road.

49:48.116 --> 49:49.457
Well, he's a weird one.

49:49.619 --> 49:52.685
First he says he did go down
to the Lake Drive on Tuesday...

49:52.851 --> 49:54.639
...and he saw you like you said.

49:54.803 --> 49:56.746
But then he gets nervous and says:

49:56.916 --> 49:59.632
"No, come to think of it, I didn't.
Didn't see anybody.

49:59.795 --> 50:01.803
Wasn't even on Lake Drive
on Tuesday."

50:01.972 --> 50:05.933
Yeah, well, Tom's old.
Maybe just slipped his mind.

50:06.099 --> 50:07.342
Don't be naive.

50:07.506 --> 50:10.125
He was scared shitless.
Somebody got to him.

50:10.290 --> 50:11.851
Come on, wait.

50:12.018 --> 50:15.150
Why would Shooter care if
Tom Greenleaf knows he's here?

50:15.315 --> 50:17.682
-Well, it depends.
-On what?

50:17.843 --> 50:19.883
On what he plans to do to you.

50:20.051 --> 50:23.466
I'm revising my opinion, Mort.
I don't think Shooter's just some nut.

50:23.635 --> 50:27.790
We need to consider the possibility
that he was hired to do this.

50:27.954 --> 50:32.362
Somebody with a grudge against you
hires a tough guy to rattle you...

50:32.530 --> 50:34.253
...scare you to death.

50:34.418 --> 50:36.622
But he hires the wrong guy.

50:36.978 --> 50:39.018
Things get out of control.

50:39.185 --> 50:41.553
They go further than
they're supposed to.

50:41.713 --> 50:43.306
Dead dogs...

50:43.472 --> 50:45.382
...burnt-down houses.

50:46.001 --> 50:47.594
Now he can't call him off.

50:49.778 --> 50:51.850
-Ted.
-Who?

50:52.786 --> 50:54.192
Ted. Amy's Ted.

50:54.353 --> 50:56.589
The Ted that Amy left me for.

50:57.202 --> 51:00.299
That's why he calls himself Shooter.
Ted wants me to know it's him.

51:00.464 --> 51:03.148
He's trying to intimidate me,
trying to send me a message.

51:03.313 --> 51:05.549
-Why? What does he want?
-I don't know.

51:05.873 --> 51:07.564
Did you piss him off?

51:10.513 --> 51:12.749
-I might have.
-Okay, here's what we do.

51:13.488 --> 51:15.693
What proof do you have
that Shooter was there?

51:15.985 --> 51:19.629
Other than the manuscript.
Physical evidence, I'm talking about.

51:19.824 --> 51:23.119
Bruises. I got bruises on my arms
from where he grabbed me.

51:23.281 --> 51:24.655
All right.

51:25.776 --> 51:28.143
You and me are going to
go see Greenleaf together.

51:28.304 --> 51:29.482
All right.

51:29.649 --> 51:32.104
Bring the manuscript.
Bring your bruises.

51:32.273 --> 51:35.588
I'm gonna push the guy hard,
make it impossible for him to lie.

51:35.759 --> 51:38.662
If he'll tell the police he was
threatened too, we've got something.

51:39.951 --> 51:41.446
Bowie's store, breakfast?

51:41.616 --> 51:42.892
9 a.m. sharp.

51:43.055 --> 51:44.265
I'll see you there.

51:44.431 --> 51:45.861
And bring your six-gun, pilgrim.

51:57.358 --> 51:59.464
It is a good ending.

52:14.574 --> 52:16.167
Oh, shit.

52:46.220 --> 52:47.399
Shit.

54:06.123 --> 54:07.585
Pall Mall.

54:09.130 --> 54:10.407
Cracker bastard.

54:36.905 --> 54:38.181
Sorry.

54:45.514 --> 54:46.920
Ken?

54:52.616 --> 54:53.926
Tom?

55:20.007 --> 55:21.186
Would you like a pack?

55:22.248 --> 55:23.840
I don't smoke.

55:27.239 --> 55:29.574
Did a guy come in here
looking for me around 9:00?

55:29.736 --> 55:32.866
-No.
-Big guy, kind of a New York-cop type.

55:33.030 --> 55:34.973
No. No, that doesn't ring a bell.

55:35.144 --> 55:36.354
I overslept.

55:36.519 --> 55:39.367
Well, maybe he did too,
because he wasn't here.

55:41.478 --> 55:42.656
Yeah.

56:25.829 --> 56:27.007
What are you doing here?

56:27.174 --> 56:29.791
Matter of fact, I was just on my way
over to your place.

56:31.430 --> 56:32.608
Where's your buddy?

56:33.764 --> 56:36.350
-Came alone.
-Sure you did.

56:45.636 --> 56:46.880
I know what you're up to.

56:51.299 --> 56:52.926
Look, Mort....

56:53.988 --> 56:56.988
A lot of what's going on right now
is my fault.

56:57.349 --> 56:59.104
Most of it, in fact.

57:00.035 --> 57:01.214
What do you want?

57:03.717 --> 57:05.309
I want you out of our life.

57:06.916 --> 57:09.086
Gotta sign your papers, Mort.

57:12.291 --> 57:15.259
My divorce papers?
Tell her to send them to my lawyer.

57:15.428 --> 57:18.297
She did. He said that you won't return
his calls for weeks.

57:18.467 --> 57:20.988
-This is about the settlement?
-Just calm down.

57:21.155 --> 57:22.748
-Money?
-It's not about money.

57:22.916 --> 57:25.087
This is about getting this thing done.

57:25.251 --> 57:28.066
Because I'm afraid if we don't,
who knows where it might go.

57:28.227 --> 57:29.601
I think you know what I mean.

57:29.763 --> 57:32.251
Well, Teddy, I think I do,
but here's the problem:

57:32.419 --> 57:35.964
I don't respond well to intimidation.
Makes me feel icky. You know?

57:38.115 --> 57:41.312
You know, I'm attempting to have
a normal conversation here.

57:41.475 --> 57:43.001
I buried my dog, mister.

57:45.122 --> 57:48.155
This whole thing is out of your
control now. You know it, I know it.

57:48.322 --> 57:50.559
You started this shit,
I'm gonna finish it.

57:51.554 --> 57:55.232
Now, do me a favor, go back
and tell that to your filthy little friend.

57:57.506 --> 57:58.751
God!

57:59.458 --> 58:01.246
Bummer, Ted.

58:37.632 --> 58:40.382
-Yeah?
-Go to where we met the other day.

58:40.544 --> 58:42.432
Walk down the path a little way.

58:42.593 --> 58:45.724
-Why?
-I'll catch up with you this afternoon.

58:45.888 --> 58:49.150
Anybody you call between
now and then is your responsibility.

59:35.327 --> 59:36.701
T om?

59:42.398 --> 59:43.959
Greenleaf?

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.868
Quarter past 2.

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.224
You been out about three hours.

01:00:31.933 --> 01:00:35.412
Your leg's sleeping.
You laid on the damn thing.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:38.613
Now, I would have moved you,
but I didn't want to wake you.

01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:40.306
Got tired of waiting.

01:00:40.475 --> 01:00:43.377
Almost pinned a note on you.
Decided not to.

01:00:43.548 --> 01:00:45.075
You scare too easy.

01:00:45.724 --> 01:00:47.927
I wouldn't go too far if I were you.

01:00:48.092 --> 01:00:51.224
I hooked you to those two men
in more ways than you know.

01:00:51.388 --> 01:00:53.111
You're insane.
I'm going to the police.

01:00:53.276 --> 01:00:57.137
Whose screwdriver you think
is in that fella's head?

01:00:59.291 --> 01:01:01.331
If you leave them here
and I disappear...

01:01:01.499 --> 01:01:04.182
...you'll find yourself standing
with your head in the noose...

01:01:04.347 --> 01:01:06.322
...and your feet in Crisco.

01:01:06.907 --> 01:01:08.468
What do you want from me?

01:01:08.635 --> 01:01:11.090
Why, I told you that already,
Mr. Rainey.

01:01:11.259 --> 01:01:14.902
I want you to fix my story.
The one you stole.

01:01:15.066 --> 01:01:16.693
Or ain't you ready to admit it yet?

01:01:17.306 --> 01:01:20.373
I did not steal your story.

01:01:20.539 --> 01:01:24.247
I expect you'll let yourself
go to Greenhaven for murder...

01:01:24.410 --> 01:01:25.753
...before you'll admit it.

01:01:26.107 --> 01:01:28.179
I have the magazine, you lunatic!

01:01:28.346 --> 01:01:29.841
I have the magazine!

01:01:30.011 --> 01:01:33.173
I have the goddamn magazine!

01:01:33.338 --> 01:01:36.469
You have this so-called magazine
right now?

01:01:36.634 --> 01:01:38.642
On me, no.

01:01:39.002 --> 01:01:40.595
I was gonna go pick it up at 3:00.

01:01:41.305 --> 01:01:43.793
There can't be any magazine.

01:01:44.026 --> 01:01:47.638
Not with that story in it.
That story is mine.

01:01:48.442 --> 01:01:51.540
What do you want? To kill me?
Why don't you just do it? Just kill me.

01:01:51.706 --> 01:01:53.299
No, sir.

01:01:53.465 --> 01:01:56.215
These others here were gonna
get in the way of our business.

01:01:56.377 --> 01:01:58.133
I couldn't have that.

01:01:58.873 --> 01:02:01.143
You bring me that story...

01:02:01.561 --> 01:02:03.087
...if it exists.

01:02:03.257 --> 01:02:04.632
Your house in two hours.

01:02:04.794 --> 01:02:08.950
You got some heavy lifting here first.
I'd get to it if I were you.

01:02:09.496 --> 01:02:11.219
By the way...

01:02:11.384 --> 01:02:13.774
...if you talk to that sheriff
of yours again...

01:02:13.944 --> 01:02:16.791
...or if you don't show up at 4:00...

01:02:17.177 --> 01:02:19.860
...I will burn your life
and every person in it...

01:02:20.025 --> 01:02:22.894
...Iike a cane field in a high wind.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:27.186
When I show you the magazine that
has my name on the contents page...

01:02:27.352 --> 01:02:29.839
...with my story inside...

01:02:30.649 --> 01:02:33.266
-...then what?
-Then I turn myself in.

01:02:33.528 --> 01:02:36.528
But I'd take care of myself
before a trial, Mr. Rainey.

01:02:36.696 --> 01:02:38.736
Because if things turn out that way...

01:02:38.903 --> 01:02:41.488
...then I suppose I am crazy.

01:02:42.007 --> 01:02:44.048
And that kind of crazy man...

01:02:44.215 --> 01:02:47.182
...has no reason or excuse to live.

01:02:49.815 --> 01:02:51.309
Listen, you got my hat.

01:02:51.479 --> 01:02:54.414
I want it, one way or the other.

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.962
-Hello?
-Mort?

01:05:30.706 --> 01:05:31.884
Yeah, hi.

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:34.283
I've been so worried about you.
Are you okay?

01:05:34.449 --> 01:05:37.383
-I'm okay. I'm okay, Amy.
-Are you sure?

01:05:37.712 --> 01:05:41.160
When I saw you yesterday,
you seemed so strained. I mean....

01:05:43.057 --> 01:05:45.610
-What?
-Do you...?

01:05:47.056 --> 01:05:50.406
Do you think things would've been
different if we hadn't lost the baby?

01:05:51.217 --> 01:05:54.184
Jesus Christ, I don't--
Amy, I don't know.

01:05:54.353 --> 01:05:57.582
Let me call you later. I gotta go.
I gotta be somewhere.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.862
What? What is it, Amy?

01:06:03.536 --> 01:06:06.090
Breathe. Breathe.

01:06:06.256 --> 01:06:07.750
Take a breath.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.528
Where are you? You at Ted's?

01:06:11.697 --> 01:06:13.037
Yeah.

01:06:14.288 --> 01:06:16.524
How we feeling about
old Ted these days?

01:06:19.472 --> 01:06:21.195
I don't know.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:23.822
I love him, I guess.

01:06:27.313 --> 01:06:30.181
-That's good.
-I didn't go with other men, you know.

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:32.936
I always wanted to tell you
that I didn't go with other men.

01:06:33.295 --> 01:06:36.678
Only T ed, and only the last few months
after you and me were already over.

01:06:36.847 --> 01:06:40.392
If we were over while we were still
together, you might've mentioned it...

01:06:40.559 --> 01:06:41.803
...because it was news to me.

01:06:41.968 --> 01:06:44.334
That's because you weren't
there anymore.

01:06:44.495 --> 01:06:45.958
You were gone all the time.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:47.653
I worked at home, Amy!

01:06:47.822 --> 01:06:50.343
That's not what I mean.

01:06:51.278 --> 01:06:53.766
Even when you were with me,
you were gone, up in your head.

01:06:53.935 --> 01:06:57.960
I don't think that I looked in your eyes
and saw you looking back at me...

01:06:58.127 --> 01:07:00.396
...I mean, really with me,
for the last two years.

01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:03.625
You know what, you're right.
You're absolutely right. It's all my fault.

01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:06.572
No. I was a chickenshit.

01:07:09.038 --> 01:07:13.162
Ted wanted us to tell you together.
He kept asking, I kept putting it off.

01:07:13.998 --> 01:07:16.748
I'll never forget that look
on your face.

01:07:16.974 --> 01:07:18.403
Get out! Get out!

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:21.063
-I gotta go.
-Mort, wait. Can't we just--?

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:22.952
No! I've gotta go.

01:07:23.117 --> 01:07:25.735
-Will you call me if you need me?
-I doubt it.

01:07:25.901 --> 01:07:28.650
-Can I come up there?
-Why on earth would you do that?

01:07:29.902 --> 01:07:32.454
You still haven't signed
the papers yet, Mort.

01:07:32.973 --> 01:07:35.210
I know you don't want to deal with it.
Me neither.

01:07:35.374 --> 01:07:38.124
But everything's been negotiated.
We don't disagree on a thing.

01:07:38.286 --> 01:07:41.448
I don't understand why you won't sign.
Don't you want to get it over with?

01:07:41.612 --> 01:07:43.107
Unbelievable.

01:07:43.853 --> 01:07:46.504
You were worried about me,
and I believed you.

01:07:46.669 --> 01:07:48.676
-What an idiot.
-I am worried.

01:07:48.845 --> 01:07:52.806
You sound like you did six months
ago, and I think it's my fault.

01:07:52.972 --> 01:07:56.169
It's my fault, and I wish
I could take it back, but I can't.

01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:58.219
I guess you shouldn't have
fucked him, then!

01:08:09.612 --> 01:08:10.986
You're not going up there?

01:08:11.147 --> 01:08:13.515
I am not going to
dance around this anymore.

01:08:13.676 --> 01:08:17.505
Once he signs, it'll be over. We won't
have these horrible conversations.

01:08:17.675 --> 01:08:19.332
All right, well, I'm going with you.

01:08:19.499 --> 01:08:23.394
I just.... I really think
I should go alone, Ted.

01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:25.287
Well, that makes no sense.

01:08:25.451 --> 01:08:27.688
Just the sight of you
is gonna send him.

01:08:27.852 --> 01:08:30.720
I was married to the guy for 1 0 years,
I know how to talk to him.

01:08:30.892 --> 01:08:33.225
All I want is for this to be over.

01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:35.587
Excuse me.

01:08:36.395 --> 01:08:38.566
I'll be back around 7.

01:08:53.386 --> 01:08:54.846
Hey, Mr. Rainey!

01:08:55.018 --> 01:08:56.676
-I'd like to--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:02.185 --> 01:09:03.876
Hey. Mr. Rainey.

01:09:06.667 --> 01:09:08.520
Mr. Rainey, are you all right?

01:09:08.841 --> 01:09:11.776
I'm sorry, my throat just
double-clutched on me for a second.

01:09:11.944 --> 01:09:14.182
-You're very pale.
-Yeah, thank you.

01:09:14.345 --> 01:09:17.662
Did the UPS guy
drop anything off for me?

01:09:18.986 --> 01:09:21.319
-Just the one thing.
-Pardon me?

01:09:22.441 --> 01:09:23.685
Just the one thing, I said.

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:25.921
-Oh. Yeah. Thank you.
-Welcome.

01:09:26.087 --> 01:09:29.404
Post office would have a cow if they
knew we handled the UPS guy's stuff.

01:09:29.576 --> 01:09:32.294
I know that,
and I certainly appreciate it.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.404
You won't tell them, will you?

01:09:35.017 --> 01:09:36.872
-No way.
-Good.

01:09:37.609 --> 01:09:39.582
Because I saw what you did.

01:09:45.095 --> 01:09:47.365
-I'm sorry?
-I said, they'd shoot me if you did.

01:09:48.774 --> 01:09:51.078
You ought to go home and lie down,
Mr. Rainey.

01:09:51.272 --> 01:09:52.482
You don't look well at all.

01:09:53.095 --> 01:09:56.162
Yeah, that's.... That's a good idea.

01:10:00.647 --> 01:10:01.824
Cute.

01:10:17.735 --> 01:10:20.637
-Got a minute?
-Well, no. I really don't right now.

01:10:20.807 --> 01:10:22.781
But I'll give you a call later.

01:10:24.295 --> 01:10:26.237
Okay. Sure.

01:10:31.623 --> 01:10:33.925
I'm gonna call you
on the phone, okay?

01:10:41.062 --> 01:10:42.589
Okay.

01:11:12.228 --> 01:11:14.432
Nineteen ninety-five.

01:11:15.397 --> 01:11:16.804
Contents.

01:11:19.109 --> 01:11:21.444
Eighty-three. Eighty-three.

01:11:25.541 --> 01:11:26.818
Eighty-one.

01:11:27.365 --> 01:11:28.738
Eighty-two.

01:11:29.348 --> 01:11:31.356
Ninety-nine.

01:11:36.708 --> 01:11:38.497
Ninety-nine.

01:11:39.749 --> 01:11:41.243
You cut it out.

01:11:42.628 --> 01:11:44.865
You son of a bitch.

01:11:48.164 --> 01:11:49.592
You cut it...

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:52.384
...out of the magazine.

01:11:53.412 --> 01:11:56.280
Wait a minute.
How would he do that?

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:58.365
I don't know...

01:11:59.587 --> 01:12:01.017
...but he did it.

01:12:01.764 --> 01:12:03.421
Think about it.

01:12:04.898 --> 01:12:06.208
How?

01:12:07.906 --> 01:12:09.598
I don't know.

01:12:50.946 --> 01:12:52.669
Why'd you put it on?

01:12:53.218 --> 01:12:54.680
I don't know.

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.859
Maybe he wanted you to.

01:12:57.024 --> 01:12:59.097
Why would he want me
to put his hat on?

01:12:59.265 --> 01:13:01.021
Maybe he wants you to....

01:13:01.824 --> 01:13:03.418
Maybe he wants me to what?

01:13:04.417 --> 01:13:05.824
To get confused.

01:13:05.985 --> 01:13:09.247
Oh, I'm already confused, pilgrim.
Plenty confused.

01:13:09.442 --> 01:13:11.417
So don't talk to me about confusion.

01:13:11.586 --> 01:13:15.261
Wait a minute. Back up just a sec.
What about that?

01:13:15.617 --> 01:13:17.045
What about what?

01:13:17.217 --> 01:13:19.803
Well, "pilgrim." "Shooter's Bay."

01:13:19.969 --> 01:13:22.521
And the half a dozen other details
you've chosen to ignore.

01:13:22.688 --> 01:13:26.616
You know what? You're nuts. I don't
need to listen to this shit from you.

01:13:26.784 --> 01:13:28.727
Are all these things coincidences?

01:13:28.897 --> 01:13:30.935
I'm wearing his bruises, aren't l?

01:13:31.296 --> 01:13:33.718
-Aren't l?
-Are you?

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.897
Well....

01:13:41.504 --> 01:13:43.260
This doesn't make any sense.

01:13:43.424 --> 01:13:47.254
Would you like to hear something that
does make sense? Call the police.

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:50.839
Call Dave Newsome, tell him to come
here this second and lock you up...

01:13:51.008 --> 01:13:53.178
...before you can do
any more damage.

01:13:53.343 --> 01:13:55.515
I'm gonna get a knife
and cut you out of me.

01:13:56.287 --> 01:13:58.708
Before you kill anyone else.

01:13:59.679 --> 01:14:01.534
I didn't kill anybody.

01:14:07.006 --> 01:14:09.494
-You had a gun.
-Wasn't loaded.

01:14:09.663 --> 01:14:11.353
-Really?
-No.

01:14:11.518 --> 01:14:13.974
You almost killed them.
You wanted to.

01:14:14.143 --> 01:14:15.669
The gun was not loaded!

01:14:15.838 --> 01:14:17.497
-You still want to.
-Shut up!

01:14:17.663 --> 01:14:19.931
Listen to me.
Because this is how it happens.

01:14:20.094 --> 01:14:22.070
-This is how it happens to people.
-Shut up!

01:14:22.239 --> 01:14:24.726
There is no John Shooter.

01:14:26.239 --> 01:14:28.988
There never has been.
You invented him.

01:14:29.533 --> 01:14:32.283
Listen to me, not to him,
before it's too late.

01:14:32.446 --> 01:14:33.656
Leave me alone!

01:14:37.342 --> 01:14:39.230
You are alone.

01:14:59.356 --> 01:15:00.884
You're not handling this.

01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:02.522
What you're doing is wrong.

01:15:02.684 --> 01:15:04.146
You have no idea
what you're doing.

01:15:04.316 --> 01:15:08.626
You've been eating potato chips
this way for 30 years. For 30 years.

01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:15.604
Sister found out about
the broken window.

01:15:15.773 --> 01:15:17.975
The school had to be withdrawn
from the competition.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:20.823
Sister found out about
the broken windows.

01:15:20.988 --> 01:15:25.363
Then she got up from the table.
We didn't talk for the rest of the night.

01:15:25.564 --> 01:15:27.801
Todd Downey thought a woman
who'd steal your love--

01:15:27.965 --> 01:15:30.004
-What does Todd have to do with it?
-Everything.

01:15:30.172 --> 01:15:31.798
I'm starting to believe
Todd was right.

01:15:31.965 --> 01:15:34.330
Everything that you're doing
is wrong.

01:15:35.451 --> 01:15:37.307
What is happening to me?

01:15:37.724 --> 01:15:42.906
Oh, I think you know.
I think you have a real good idea.

01:15:43.675 --> 01:15:44.854
You don't exist.

01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:48.728
Me? I exist, Mr. Rainey.

01:15:49.564 --> 01:15:52.497
I exist because you made me.

01:15:52.794 --> 01:15:55.478
-Check it out.
-You thought me up.

01:15:55.643 --> 01:15:57.747
I'm a dairy farmer from Mississippi.

01:15:57.915 --> 01:15:59.508
Gave me my name.

01:15:59.835 --> 01:16:02.737
Told me everything
you wanted me to do.

01:16:15.066 --> 01:16:18.328
I did them things
so you wouldn't have to.

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:20.662
Right up there, Tom.
We were standing right there.

01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:22.583
Yeah, I know, Mort. I saw you.

01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:25.464
I didn't want to say it in front of him,
but you were alone.

01:16:26.489 --> 01:16:30.613
I know, Tom. Look, just pull over for a
second. I want to show you something.

01:16:33.306 --> 01:16:37.300
Didn't have the stomach to do it
yourself, but you knew I did.

01:16:39.833 --> 01:16:41.207
Are we done yet?

01:16:41.369 --> 01:16:44.271
We got things all cleaned up
around here?

01:16:44.825 --> 01:16:47.378
What's the real reason I come for?

01:16:49.113 --> 01:16:51.928
-Fix the story.
-That's right.

01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:54.098
Fix the ending.

01:16:54.425 --> 01:16:55.767
Got to fix the ending.

01:16:55.929 --> 01:16:58.896
And how exactly do you suppose
we ought to do that?

01:17:22.648 --> 01:17:24.076
Mort?

01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:11.564
Mort?

01:18:13.653 --> 01:18:16.271
Are you there?
I saw your car outside.

01:18:20.373 --> 01:18:21.835
Hello?

01:18:47.572 --> 01:18:49.067
Mort?

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:55.918
Chico?

01:19:20.116 --> 01:19:22.057
That explains a lot.

01:19:25.555 --> 01:19:26.896
What the hell?

01:20:50.832 --> 01:20:52.262
Hi.

01:20:58.928 --> 01:21:00.838
Jesus, Mort.

01:21:03.888 --> 01:21:05.644
Where'd you get that old thing?
The attic?

01:21:05.937 --> 01:21:07.626
It's mine.

01:21:08.623 --> 01:21:10.696
Wasn't ever anybody else's.

01:21:13.263 --> 01:21:15.151
Mort, what's wrong?

01:21:15.311 --> 01:21:17.645
You got you a wrong number, missus.

01:21:19.376 --> 01:21:20.554
Ain't no Mort here.

01:21:21.392 --> 01:21:22.603
Mort's dead.

01:21:23.248 --> 01:21:24.741
He did a lot of squirming around...

01:21:24.910 --> 01:21:29.133
...but in the end he couldn't lie to
himself anymore, let alone to me.

01:21:29.294 --> 01:21:32.361
Now, I never put a hand on him,
missus. I swear.

01:21:32.527 --> 01:21:34.119
He took the coward's way out.

01:21:34.286 --> 01:21:36.937
-Why are you talking this way?
-That's just the way I talk.

01:21:37.199 --> 01:21:38.377
You're scaring me.

01:21:38.542 --> 01:21:41.096
It don't matter.
You won't be scared long.

01:21:58.063 --> 01:21:59.273
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:22:29.165 --> 01:22:30.987
Help!

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:39.554
I'm about done fussing with you.

01:22:54.347 --> 01:22:56.682
I am so sorry, missus...

01:22:56.843 --> 01:22:59.080
...but right is right
and fair is fair...

01:22:59.244 --> 01:23:01.153
...and something has got to be done.

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:06.081
By the way, I want you to know
that none of this was my idea.

01:23:06.251 --> 01:23:07.878
It was Mr. Rainey all along.

01:23:08.044 --> 01:23:10.115
You are Mort Rainey.

01:23:10.282 --> 01:23:11.842
I got a place for you.

01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:13.920
You are Mort Rainey.

01:23:14.091 --> 01:23:15.978
I got it all picked out.

01:23:17.291 --> 01:23:19.396
You are Mort Rainey.

01:23:30.602 --> 01:23:32.129
Mort....

01:23:38.186 --> 01:23:39.615
Amy?

01:23:42.314 --> 01:23:44.453
-Amy?
-Ted.

01:23:47.626 --> 01:23:50.472
-Amy?
-Ted! No!

01:24:05.577 --> 01:24:07.170
No!

01:24:15.977 --> 01:24:18.977
"'l know I can do it,'
Todd Downey said...

01:24:19.881 --> 01:24:23.972
...helping himself to another ear
of corn from the steaming bowl.

01:24:25.608 --> 01:24:27.911
'I'm sure that in time...

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.350
...her death will be a mystery...

01:24:33.864 --> 01:24:35.720
...even to me."'

01:24:54.536 --> 01:24:55.876
Hi.

01:24:56.679 --> 01:24:58.109
Hi.

01:25:04.583 --> 01:25:05.760
I'm kind of late.

01:25:14.886 --> 01:25:16.228
Hi.

01:25:16.775 --> 01:25:18.149
Hi.

01:25:18.694 --> 01:25:20.582
-Braces.
-Yeah.

01:25:20.742 --> 01:25:22.782
Getting a few things
straightened out.

01:25:27.462 --> 01:25:32.283
I was kind of wondering if sometime
you might possibly be interested in--

01:25:32.454 --> 01:25:34.494
I don't need a bag.

01:26:03.526 --> 01:26:05.184
Mr. Rainey?

01:26:07.236 --> 01:26:09.855
Your front door's open.
I'm coming in.

01:26:33.763 --> 01:26:35.325
Mr. Rainey?

01:26:36.580 --> 01:26:39.580
-Mort Rainey?
-Oh, hi, Dave.

01:26:40.643 --> 01:26:42.585
I didn't hear you.
Come on up.

01:26:45.475 --> 01:26:47.548
Glad you're here.
I could use the break.

01:26:47.716 --> 01:26:50.268
Working lunch. I'm on a roll.

01:26:52.676 --> 01:26:53.919
Yeah.

01:26:55.523 --> 01:26:57.149
Both you and I know what you did.

01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:02.040
Maybe we don't have enough to
put you away now, but eventually...

01:27:02.914 --> 01:27:04.824
...we'll find those bodies.

01:27:04.995 --> 01:27:06.489
We'll tie you to them...

01:27:06.659 --> 01:27:08.284
...and you're going away.

01:27:09.955 --> 01:27:13.468
In the meantime, I'd appreciate it if
you didn't come into town anymore.

01:27:14.755 --> 01:27:16.281
Makes people uncomfortable.

01:27:19.042 --> 01:27:21.409
You can do your shopping
in New London.

01:27:23.682 --> 01:27:25.722
Did you hear what I said?

01:27:28.130 --> 01:27:30.715
Sure. No problem.

01:27:32.322 --> 01:27:33.728
You know...

01:27:34.465 --> 01:27:38.077
...the only thing that matters
is the ending.

01:27:38.369 --> 01:27:41.086
It's the most important part
of the story, the ending.

01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:43.479
And this one...

01:27:45.282 --> 01:27:46.907
...is very good.

01:27:49.762 --> 01:27:51.451
This one's perfect.
