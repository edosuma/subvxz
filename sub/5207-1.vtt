Where The Wild Things Are
timing and subtitle by pee-jay

01:24.750 --> 01:27.730
Hey Claire! Wanna see something great?

01:28.200 --> 01:29.780
Who else was there?

01:30.040 --> 01:31.600
It's an igloo.

01:31.740 --> 01:33.390
- And?
- I made it.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.340
Yeah. My brother.

01:35.860 --> 01:37.580
- Hey Claire!
- I can't.

01:37.630 --> 01:39.270
We're supposed to go tomy dad's
that weekend.

01:39.320 --> 01:43.150
The snowplows left some snow across
the street and I dug a hole into it.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.440
Max, go play with your friends!

02:00.940 --> 02:02.460
You! Go that way!

02:02.610 --> 02:04.060
You! Go that way!

02:05.170 --> 02:08.090
No! Don't talk to me like that!
You're just a fence!

02:08.139 --> 02:10.310
Go play with your
own fence friends!

02:10.360 --> 02:11.900
Now move out!

02:30.790 --> 02:34.090
- Hey, Claire. What's up? You ready?
- Hey, Claire.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.090
Claire, is that your brother?

03:20.670 --> 03:22.210
The kid is dead.

03:22.740 --> 03:23.660
Yeah!

03:28.460 --> 03:29.960
The kid's so dead!

03:33.460 --> 03:34.710
Max! Go away!

03:35.360 --> 03:37.110
- We got him!
- Yeah!

03:37.920 --> 03:40.320
W got him!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

04:03.290 --> 04:05.090
You okay?

04:05.140 --> 04:07.260
Alright now. Let's go!

06:02.560 --> 06:04.090
Hey. I'm home!

06:07.290 --> 06:10.050
Hey. What's wrong?

06:17.720 --> 06:20.670
Claire and her stupid friends
smashed my igloo.

06:23.780 --> 06:26.230
And she didn't do anything about it.

06:27.910 --> 06:29.360
I'm sorry, honey.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.770
I'd have done something about it.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.770
Max, what have you done?

07:00.970 --> 07:04.270
No. I don't want to bother you,
just... just quickly...

07:04.810 --> 07:05.930
Can you tell me exactly,

07:05.980 --> 07:08.880
what Mr. Lasseter didn't like
about the report?

07:10.720 --> 07:12.800
What am I suppose to do?

07:16.560 --> 07:19.860
No, I'm just tired and I've got
a rough day here and...

07:22.150 --> 07:25.010
I can not afford to lose this.

07:30.710 --> 07:31.990
I know. I know it. I, uh...

07:32.040 --> 07:36.240
but I better get started because
I'd like to turn it in the morning.

07:37.630 --> 07:41.930
No, I hear you. I hear you and this
will be the last time. I promise, okay?

07:42.960 --> 07:43.910
Thanks.

07:57.390 --> 07:58.540
Hey.

08:00.110 --> 08:01.070
Hi.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.860
I could use a story.

08:09.460 --> 08:10.310
Sure.

08:14.590 --> 08:16.590
There were some buildings...

08:16.640 --> 08:19.290
These were these really
tall buildings...

08:20.120 --> 08:21.720
and they could walk.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.560
Then there were some vampires.

08:24.720 --> 08:30.270
One of the vampires bit the tallest
building and his fangs broke off...

08:32.390 --> 08:34.789
then all his other teeth fell out...

08:34.840 --> 08:36.990
then he started crying...

08:37.720 --> 08:40.530
and then all the other vampires...

08:41.950 --> 08:44.420
said Why are you crying?

08:46.030 --> 08:48.880
Aren't those just your baby teeth?

08:48.950 --> 08:51.780
And he said,

08:51.990 --> 08:54.650
No, those are my grown-up teeth...

08:55.900 --> 09:01.310
And the vampires knew that
he couldn't be a vampire anymore

09:02.040 --> 09:03.640
so they left him.

09:08.130 --> 09:09.420
The end.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.500
...and the sun is the center
of our solar system.

09:28.140 --> 09:29.900
It's the reason all the planets
are here.

09:29.950 --> 09:33.390
Its warmth gives us sunlight,
makes our planet livable.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.070
Now, of course the sun won't always
be here to keep us warm,

09:36.120 --> 09:38.600
It, like all things, will die...

09:39.800 --> 09:42.240
and when it does, first it'll expand,

09:42.290 --> 09:44.810
enveloping all the surrounding
planets, including Earth,

09:44.860 --> 09:46.960
before consuming them rapidly.

09:47.150 --> 09:50.990
The sun, after all, is just fuel
burning ferociously,

09:51.270 --> 09:54.570
and when it runs out of fuel...
well... it'll be gone.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.730
Well after that, the solar system
will go dark... permanently.

10:01.650 --> 10:03.190
I'm sure by that time,

10:03.240 --> 10:05.910
the human race will have fallen
to any number of calamities...

10:05.960 --> 10:09.230
...war, pollution, global warming,

10:09.740 --> 10:14.909
tsunamis. earthquakes, meteors...

10:15.720 --> 10:18.270
but hey, who knows, right?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.810
Mom? Mom, come up here!

10:50.520 --> 10:52.020
Max, I'm busy!

10:52.430 --> 10:53.910
I rebuilt the fort!

10:53.960 --> 10:56.660
You gotta get inside it,
the lava's coming.

10:57.750 --> 11:01.290
Oh, oh! And it's a rocket ship,
and it's gonna take off!

11:06.610 --> 11:08.770
You want me to
save you a seat?

11:38.040 --> 11:40.910
- You're really... nice.
- ...Cute.

11:42.140 --> 11:43.830
- No.
- You're really.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.270
Hi, sweetie.

11:57.130 --> 12:00.040
Claire, it's almost dinner!

12:00.090 --> 12:02.870
Get your stuff off the table, please.

12:15.180 --> 12:16.420
Hey, shhh.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.580
Mom, what is that?

12:26.020 --> 12:26.980
Pâté.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.480
Frozen corn?
What's wrong with real corn?

12:33.530 --> 12:35.295
Frozen corn is real, alright?

12:35.345 --> 12:37.070
And get off the chair, please.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.100
And go tell your sister to clear
her stuff off the table.

12:39.150 --> 12:42.970
CLAIRE GET YOUR STUFF OFF
THE DINING ROOM TABLE!

12:45.800 --> 12:47.960
Max, don't pull that now.

12:54.360 --> 12:57.040
Max, get off the counter, get off.

12:57.090 --> 12:59.380
I have a friend here...
you're embarrassing me.

12:59.430 --> 13:01.240
Woman, feed me!

13:02.510 --> 13:04.810
Max, get off. Get off the counter!

13:05.640 --> 13:09.240
Get off the damn counter MAX! Now. NOW!

13:09.340 --> 13:11.570
- I'll eat you up!
- Get down!

13:11.620 --> 13:13.680
- GRRRAAR!
- Get off!

13:14.290 --> 13:16.240
Stop! Get over here!

13:16.960 --> 13:20.000
What's wrong with you?
This is not the acceptable behaviour!

13:20.050 --> 13:21.330
That is acceptable!

13:21.380 --> 13:24.360
No dinner for you, Max!
Go to your room. Now!

13:25.050 --> 13:27.390
OW! You bit me! That hurt!

13:27.440 --> 13:29.040
Connie, he can't treat you like that.

13:29.090 --> 13:31.580
Max! What is wrong with you?

13:31.950 --> 13:33.740
You're out of control!

13:33.790 --> 13:35.430
Not my fault!

13:43.080 --> 13:43.920
Max!

13:50.940 --> 13:51.820
Max!

13:55.330 --> 13:56.210
Max!

14:07.870 --> 14:08.740
Max!

14:14.940 --> 14:17.360
Noooo!

14:19.530 --> 14:21.030
I hate you!

16:00.180 --> 16:01.410
Hello?

19:17.340 --> 19:20.090
That's it. Tear 'em all down.
Tear 'em down.

19:26.260 --> 19:29.130
Come on! We've got a few more
to go over here.

19:34.410 --> 19:36.360
Is anyone going to help me?

19:37.361 --> 19:39.461
We liked them. They were nice.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.990
I mean, this is a problem.
Don't you see this is a problem?

19:43.040 --> 19:45.250
- I will...
- No, I'll just do it myself...

19:45.300 --> 19:47.100
- ...help?
- ...as usual.

19:47.530 --> 19:49.740
Um, Carol, could I talk to you
for a second?

19:49.790 --> 19:51.730
Oh, Douglas, not right now. I'm busy.

19:51.780 --> 19:52.890
Okay.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.380
Can you hear me from up here?

19:54.430 --> 19:57.480
And I'm the only one
who cares enough to do this.

19:58.490 --> 19:59.690
Or this!

20:00.660 --> 20:02.720
Carol, is this really necessary?

20:02.770 --> 20:05.828
Ask K.W. You ask K.W. if it's necessary.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.960
- She's not here. She left.
- I... She left?

20:09.010 --> 20:12.110
She left. Exactly.
That's why, it's necessary.

20:12.150 --> 20:14.010
Um... I will help.

20:14.070 --> 20:17.020
Okay, okay, good. Come on.
Come on. Here ya go.

20:19.660 --> 20:21.480
- Thank you.
- Uhh... glad to help.

20:21.530 --> 20:22.560
Who else wants lend a hand?

20:22.610 --> 20:24.680
What do you think, Judith?
Should I help, too?

20:24.730 --> 20:26.110
No, you shouldn't help him!

20:26.160 --> 20:27.700
I just thought it would
make him feel better.

20:27.750 --> 20:30.610
Good idea, Ira. Go stand in this hut
over here before it gets wrecked.

20:30.660 --> 20:33.520
- I know, I know I shouldn't.
- Ira, you're not helping.

20:33.570 --> 20:35.160
- Go in the hut.
- I'll stand right over here.

20:35.210 --> 20:36.900
- No!
- Ira!

20:39.790 --> 20:41.410
This is crazy!

20:41.660 --> 20:45.140
No, no it was crazy already.
I'm just eliminating the crazy.

20:45.190 --> 20:47.780
I don't think the crazy
has been eliminated.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.430
Isn't anyone gonna be
on my side anymore?

20:51.330 --> 20:54.000
Yeah, well, I guess not.

20:57.230 --> 20:58.130
Fine,

20:59.240 --> 21:01.330
I'll just be on my own side,

21:02.730 --> 21:03.830
by myself.

21:09.680 --> 21:13.730
Nobody cares. I'm the only one that
cares that we don't stay together.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.330
I'm the only one that
cares about that so...

21:18.280 --> 21:19.590
See? I care.

21:20.220 --> 21:21.230
Carol?

21:21.780 --> 21:25.560
You don't care and just stand there
and whisper to each other about me

21:25.610 --> 21:27.750
- like you always do.
- Oh yeah, that's true.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.750
But I know what I'm doing.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.070
- Ira, what is it?
- I don't know.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.180
Hello.

22:40.980 --> 22:43.600
See, this guy gets it.

22:45.720 --> 22:48.770
Hey... um... weird little... ...thing.

22:49.330 --> 22:51.000
I like the way you destroy stuff.
Good technique.

22:51.050 --> 22:53.260
There's a spark to your work
that can't be taught.

22:53.310 --> 22:54.390
Thanks.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.780
Alright, see that one over there?

22:55.830 --> 22:57.410
You get that one, I'll get this one.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.830
- See who can do it faster. Okay?
- Okay.

22:59.880 --> 23:00.810
Go!

23:22.620 --> 23:25.370
Hey, what are you doing?

23:25.550 --> 23:26.630
I... I...

23:28.500 --> 23:31.200
- I'm just helping.
- By smashing our houses?

23:31.250 --> 23:33.400
- These are your houses?
- Yeah.

23:34.390 --> 23:36.200
- What's wrong with them?
- What do your houses look like?

23:36.250 --> 23:37.750
I bet his houses are funny looking.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.900
Look, we worked very hard on these.

23:39.950 --> 23:43.060
Then you, sir, showed up
and started "helping."

23:43.120 --> 23:44.400
- I'm cold.
- Who are you?

23:44.450 --> 23:46.210
Are you one of K.W.'s new friends?

23:46.260 --> 23:48.110
Oh, are you Bob or Terry?

23:48.400 --> 23:49.970
I don't even know who that is?

23:50.020 --> 23:52.630
- He looks like a Bob.
- Things are getting crazy here.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.730
- This thing's dangerous.
- You're scaring me.

23:54.780 --> 23:57.060
You know what I say,
if you've got a problem,

23:57.110 --> 23:58.230
eat it.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.660
- It's the only way to solve these
types of issues. - Yeah. The only way.

24:01.710 --> 24:03.710
Oh, he's probably got
those little bird bones.

24:03.760 --> 24:04.920
I hate bones.

24:04.970 --> 24:07.510
You haven't those little bird bones
that are gonna cut up my mouth, do you?

24:07.560 --> 24:09.550
- No, I don't have bird bones.
- You better not!

24:09.600 --> 24:12.460
You'd better not be difficult to eat!
Did you even think of that?

24:12.510 --> 24:14.100
God, you're selfish!

24:14.150 --> 24:16.520
I hope, you don't taste
as selfish as you look.

24:16.570 --> 24:18.790
- Um... let's eat it!
- Stop!

24:22.750 --> 24:26.720
Stop!

24:27.230 --> 24:28.830
BEEEEEE STIIIIIIILL!

24:33.750 --> 24:34.870
Why?

24:35.890 --> 24:37.040
Because...

24:40.020 --> 24:41.170
Because...

24:41.750 --> 24:44.930
- Why?
- Well because... you can't eat me!

24:46.750 --> 24:49.540
You didn't know that, so I forgive you.
But never try it again.

24:49.590 --> 24:50.750
Why not?

24:51.080 --> 24:53.820
I... I have powers from another land.

24:54.230 --> 24:55.230
Powers...

24:55.280 --> 24:56.910
From ancient times.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.350
Don't make me show you.

25:00.450 --> 25:01.950
I had to show these Vikings once--

25:02.000 --> 25:04.010
Viking? What's a Viking?

25:05.430 --> 25:08.150
They wear horn hats, and they're big--

25:09.160 --> 25:10.910
bigger than all of you!

25:11.430 --> 25:13.870
One time they attacked me
in my ice fortress.

25:13.920 --> 25:17.420
They tried to cave in the roof,
but I'd made it too strong.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.840
I told them to be still,
but they didn't.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.440
I conquered them.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.050
I had to make their heads explode.

25:25.550 --> 25:29.300
And then they realized that I knew
all the secrets to the world.

25:30.700 --> 25:33.000
And then you know what happened?

25:35.240 --> 25:37.040
They made me their king.

25:37.210 --> 25:38.110
Wow.

25:38.310 --> 25:40.290
- King?
- You were a king?

25:40.820 --> 25:43.910
I knew, there was something special
about him. I told you, guys.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.190
So wait, you exploded their heads?

25:46.240 --> 25:49.710
Oh come on. Our heads are bigger.
You can't explode big heads!

25:49.760 --> 25:52.680
No, their heads were bigger
than yours, believe me.

25:52.730 --> 25:54.460
But you're so small.

25:54.580 --> 25:58.480
Small is good. My powers are able
to slip right through the cracks.

25:59.060 --> 26:00.960
What if the cracks are closed up?

26:01.010 --> 26:03.139
Then I have a re-cracker that
goes right through that.

26:03.189 --> 26:04.620
But what if we have some
sort of material

26:04.670 --> 26:06.090
that re-crackers can't
get through?

26:06.140 --> 26:08.360
Then I have a double re-cracker
which can get through

26:08.410 --> 26:09.930
anything in the whole universe,

26:09.980 --> 26:13.680
and that's the end, and there's nothing
more powerful after that ever. Period.

26:13.730 --> 26:16.480
- Wow, he does sound powerful.
- He's a double re-cracker.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.510
Yeah, yeah, but there has to
be some material somewhere,

26:18.560 --> 26:20.150
maybe really deep underground
that if we  combined it with --

26:20.200 --> 26:21.370
Quiet!

26:21.580 --> 26:23.680
- Something...
- Be quiet!

26:24.740 --> 26:29.960
I'm sorry. So you were their king
and you made everything right?

26:31.750 --> 26:33.050
Yeah.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.440
Well uh, you know...
what about loneliness?

26:37.260 --> 26:40.590
What he's saying is,
will you keep out all the sadness?

26:50.900 --> 26:54.050
I have sadness shield.
It keeps out all the sadness.

26:54.210 --> 26:56.310
It's big enough for all of us.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.140
I just do this to loneliness.

27:00.210 --> 27:01.710
Pooooww.

27:02.370 --> 27:03.930
- Wow.
- I knew it! I knew it!

27:03.980 --> 27:05.980
When he showed up, I saw it.

27:06.380 --> 27:08.190
Why don't you guys
ever listen to me?

27:08.240 --> 27:11.160
You're right, Carol, I didn't see it.

27:11.490 --> 27:12.690
I don't understand.

27:12.740 --> 27:15.820
He doesn't look like a king.
If he could be king, I could be king.

27:15.870 --> 27:16.240
Shhh.

27:16.290 --> 27:18.800
Um, were you the king
where you came from?

27:18.850 --> 27:20.930
Yeah. Yeah, for twenty years.

27:22.350 --> 27:25.300
- That's impressive.
- That's incredible, right?

27:25.830 --> 27:27.880
Looks like we found our king.

27:28.300 --> 27:30.550
- You are our king, right?
- Yeah.

27:32.670 --> 27:33.870
Yeah. I am.

27:34.710 --> 27:35.630
Oh, I'm so relieved.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.050
Sorry, we were gonna eat you.
We didn't know you were a king.

27:38.100 --> 27:39.720
- That was insane.
- Yeah. Yeah. I mean...

27:39.770 --> 27:41.390
- Oh my god! It's K.W.
- What?

27:41.440 --> 27:43.140
- What?
- Oh! Hi, K.W.!

27:43.390 --> 27:45.300
K.W., it's good to see you.

27:45.350 --> 27:48.050
I thought you were with your
new best friends, Bob and Terry.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.000
What are you, guys, doing?

27:50.540 --> 27:51.950
- Who's that?
- K.W. get in here.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.830
You gotta hear this.
We finally got a king.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.590
- That's true!
- A very impressive one.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.190
Hey, K.W. we got a king!

27:57.240 --> 28:00.430
You and me could go for a walk
and I'll tell you all about it. Anytime.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.980
You could carry me like a little baby.

28:03.350 --> 28:07.090
Uh... yeah. Anyway, I don't know
if I'm sticking around.

28:07.140 --> 28:08.840
I just came back to...

28:10.300 --> 28:13.450
...to get that one stick I left here.
Anyone see it?

28:13.550 --> 28:16.650
I'll help find it, K.W.
I'm good at finding sticks.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.340
- K.W., he's very powerful!
- Shh, shh. Stop. Don't push her.

28:20.390 --> 28:23.440
She'll figure it out for herself.
Just leave her be, okay?

28:23.490 --> 28:26.230
King.
King, this way, your majesty, please.

28:31.490 --> 28:34.890
Oh, Look!
He's going to make us happy, Judy.

28:34.970 --> 28:35.820
Yeah,

28:36.730 --> 28:38.930
but happiness isn't always
the best way to be happy.

28:38.980 --> 28:40.480
Judith, stop.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.230
He's small for a king.
Am I nuts? He's small.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.250
Yeah, that's
what I said.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.320
- Alexander, shhh!
- Sorry.

28:55.910 --> 28:58.390
I like it better when we have a king.

29:00.250 --> 29:02.950
I like Carol better when we have a king.

29:03.140 --> 29:05.440
Hey, what happened to our houses?

29:06.390 --> 29:08.240
Oh... um, they fell down.

29:18.660 --> 29:20.510
Are those... other kings?

29:22.610 --> 29:24.290
No, they were here
when we got here.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.990
I never saw them.
Never even noticed them.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.310
You okay?

29:37.010 --> 29:37.860
Yeah.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.630
You are now the king.

29:46.780 --> 29:49.130
And you will be a truly great king.

29:50.190 --> 29:52.170
Oh it looks good on him, look.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.330
He looks great.
Huh king?

29:53.380 --> 29:54.680
- It looks perfect!
- King! King!

29:54.730 --> 29:56.300
- It looks perfect, Carol.
- We have a king.

29:56.350 --> 29:58.340
- Fresh King!
- Fine.

29:59.140 --> 30:01.810
- Oh, I Know this! I know this part!
- "KING! KING! KING! KING!"

30:01.860 --> 30:04.710
Hey King! What's your first
order of business?

30:07.620 --> 30:10.160
Let the wild rumpus start!

30:10.790 --> 30:12.960
- Perfect answer!
- Yeah!

30:18.090 --> 30:19.130
Come on!

30:19.260 --> 30:20.560
Come on, king!

30:27.210 --> 30:29.010
Alright K.W. Get in.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.060
Guys! Follow me!

32:01.340 --> 32:02.660
What?

32:03.450 --> 32:05.100
You're funny looking.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.590
That's all.

32:11.940 --> 32:14.510
Hey, King! King-King! Watch this!

32:21.390 --> 32:22.820
Hey!

32:23.230 --> 32:24.810
Hey! Jumping guy!

32:25.270 --> 32:26.470
Jumping guy!

32:26.890 --> 32:28.650
Hey, Mister!

32:30.400 --> 32:31.760
Wait up!

32:35.610 --> 32:37.450
Hey Jumping guy!

32:38.150 --> 32:40.720
- Hey!
- Hey King, watch this!

32:50.990 --> 32:53.370
Alright tree, we'll settle this later.

32:53.420 --> 32:56.720
Oh look. Everyone wants to
be friends with the new guy.

32:57.610 --> 32:59.460
Well, this is our family.

32:59.650 --> 33:01.820
I hope you can see how excited
they are to have a king.

33:01.870 --> 33:04.340
Sometimes they have an odd way
of showing it, I mean,

33:04.390 --> 33:08.850
they act weird, you know, and...
it hurts other people's feelings.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.580
- Ira, my love.
- What?

33:10.630 --> 33:11.560
- Come here!
- Okay.

33:11.610 --> 33:14.320
Oh, that's Judith and Ira.
They're in love.

33:18.810 --> 33:20.560
What were you thinking?

33:22.670 --> 33:24.050
Watch me! Look!

33:24.790 --> 33:26.300
That's Alexander.

33:26.350 --> 33:28.290
Look! I hate this tree!

33:29.680 --> 33:32.690
Well, he just wants an attention.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

33:32.740 --> 33:33.740
77...

33:34.540 --> 33:35.770
78...

33:35.820 --> 33:37.250
...no, wait. No, no, that was...

33:37.300 --> 33:38.810
- That's Douglas.
- ...yeah that's it, 78.

33:38.860 --> 33:40.880
I count on him for everything.

33:40.930 --> 33:43.930
If I was stranded on a deserted island
and could only take one thing,

33:43.980 --> 33:45.950
it would be Douglas. We could
share him if you want, King.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.800
Yeah. Sounds good,
I might need one of those.

33:49.390 --> 33:52.320
Douglas, no no no, stop, that's not
the way I want you to do it.

33:52.370 --> 33:54.540
- Oh, sorry.
- Here, I'll show you.

33:54.590 --> 33:56.000
How that happened?

33:56.050 --> 33:58.850
An accident.
I don't know, how that happened.

33:59.370 --> 34:02.040
We haven't formally met. I'm Ira.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.280
I put the holes in the trees;
maybe you saw one of those?

34:07.020 --> 34:07.780
Come here.

34:07.830 --> 34:10.850
Or maybe not. Anyways, it's what I do.

34:11.760 --> 34:14.360
Not really important like things you do.

34:14.909 --> 34:16.840
Oh, and this is Judith.

34:17.219 --> 34:20.719
Ah, he don't really need to know me.
I'm kind of a downer.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.500
King, that's not true.

34:22.670 --> 34:25.750
- Hey, let me see your face. - You could
introduce me to the king if you want.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.510
Let me see your face.

34:28.460 --> 34:31.360
Oooh. What is that?
Don't worry, let me see it.

34:44.730 --> 34:46.580
Oooh, good shot, Douglas!

34:47.030 --> 34:48.367
Almost got me.

34:48.510 --> 34:50.250
Almost got me, Douglas.

34:50.300 --> 34:55.940
We'll get him next time, won't we?
Yes. Yes, we will. We will.

34:57.270 --> 34:59.150
Hey, what are you doing?

35:02.760 --> 35:05.560
Is she the one you were mad at
when you were smashing stuff?

35:05.610 --> 35:09.100
Yeah... No! No, no, um...

35:10.360 --> 35:13.210
I thought she said she wasn't
gonna come back.

35:13.660 --> 35:15.530
Well, it looks like she's back now.

35:15.580 --> 35:16.430
Yeah.

35:17.440 --> 35:18.970
Yeah, I hope so.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.830
I'm gonna get her!

35:21.880 --> 35:24.280
No! No! Don't! Don't! She's doesn't
like that kind of thing. Come back!

35:24.330 --> 35:26.800
- Come back here!
- Ira, my love. Come here!

35:26.850 --> 35:29.900
- Hey king!
- Uh, King, I wouldn't recommend that.

35:34.210 --> 35:35.630
Stop it!

35:37.400 --> 35:40.730
Hey stop it!
Go pick someone else's nose!

35:42.620 --> 35:43.950
Max, look out!

35:44.920 --> 35:45.870
Gotcha!

35:52.210 --> 35:54.810
Alexander, get over there and be social.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.350
Let's be like this forever!

36:01.590 --> 36:04.380
- You guys never think this is me,
but this is really me. - Max!

36:04.430 --> 36:07.080
He's starting things off right,
our king.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.820
- Wow, this guy gets things done.
- That was... That was great.

36:10.870 --> 36:11.840
Yeah, that was.

36:11.890 --> 36:14.770
That was fun. We forgot how to have fun.

36:14.820 --> 36:16.440
- That's truth, Carol.
- I mean, I didn't, but...

36:16.490 --> 36:18.030
No. No. You didn't, Carol.

36:18.080 --> 36:21.100
- Hey, K.W., your toe's in my ear.
- Good! You're keeping it warm.

36:21.150 --> 36:24.070
- Hey, who's on my face?
- Oh, I'm sorry Carol.

36:24.370 --> 36:25.610
Let me move.

36:26.040 --> 36:28.920
Oh, I like this.
Let's be like this forever.

36:29.190 --> 36:31.100
The king having a problem?

36:31.210 --> 36:33.560
My foot's stuck under this fat guy.

36:35.680 --> 36:36.580
There.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.320
- Thanks.
- I'm K.W.

36:39.870 --> 36:41.870
- I'm Max.
- I know.

36:43.880 --> 36:46.280
Hey, so are you gonna stay?

36:47.730 --> 36:49.470
- Well...
- They all want you to.

36:49.520 --> 36:50.990
It's complicated.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.970
I don't even know how
everything got this way.

36:54.790 --> 36:56.720
Things seem better now, though.

36:56.770 --> 36:58.420
Yeah. Well, they are.

37:00.130 --> 37:01.460
Okay, king

37:02.840 --> 37:04.170
Who are Bob and Terry?

37:04.220 --> 37:06.800
Oh they're really good friends of mine.

37:07.070 --> 37:08.770
I don't even know
how to describe them,

37:08.820 --> 37:12.030
they're just different
from everybody here.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.510
...It's just different.

37:15.230 --> 37:18.630
- Well, do you like them more than--
- You ask a lot of questions.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.180
What's your story?

37:20.450 --> 37:22.050
Why'd you come here?

37:22.170 --> 37:23.120
Well...

37:23.870 --> 37:26.420
I'm an explorer and I travel a lot.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.910
And I travel by a sea,

37:28.960 --> 37:30.730
- Right.
- I used to travel by air.

37:30.780 --> 37:33.530
Oh, so obviously you have no home
or family?

37:35.410 --> 37:37.510
I had one of those... but I...

37:38.580 --> 37:40.620
- But you ate 'em all.
- No!

37:41.290 --> 37:44.140
No. I just bit one of 'em, that's all, and...

37:44.890 --> 37:46.290
they went crazy.

37:52.040 --> 37:53.890
I don't like frozen corn.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.170
I'm sorry. That's why you left?

38:00.550 --> 38:02.840
They act like I'm a bad person.

38:03.780 --> 38:06.260
- Well, are you?
- I don't know.

38:08.440 --> 38:09.690
I don't know.

38:11.440 --> 38:14.450
Well, I'm glad you came.

38:14.980 --> 38:17.400
It'll be good to have someone around
who doesn't eat everybody.

38:17.450 --> 38:19.470
I mean, you just bite everyone.

38:19.520 --> 38:22.730
Biters aren't so bad, eaters are
the one's I just can't stand.

38:22.780 --> 38:24.930
I have no plans to eat anybody.

38:25.580 --> 38:27.440
Alright. Good.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.790
Good night.

38:37.990 --> 38:39.840
Good night K.W.

38:40.390 --> 38:41.450
Good night.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.100
- Night Ira.
- Night.

38:43.710 --> 38:44.920
Good night Douglas.

38:44.970 --> 38:46.370
Good night Carol.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.730
Good night Judith.

38:47.780 --> 38:49.020
Good night.

38:49.340 --> 38:50.790
Good night, Judy.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.460
Good night, Darling.

38:52.610 --> 38:54.440
Good night Alex.

38:54.770 --> 38:56.170
- Good night, King
- Good night.

38:56.220 --> 38:59.220
- Oh! Good night, King.
- Yeah, good night, King.

39:00.190 --> 39:01.940
Oh, this is nice.

39:02.870 --> 39:04.520
Good night everybody.

39:05.230 --> 39:06.980
Everybody sweet dreams.

39:37.440 --> 39:41.490
I didn't want to wake you up, but I
really want to show you something.

39:43.010 --> 39:43.580
Okay.

39:43.630 --> 39:47.480
And on the way I can
show you your kingdom.

39:48.170 --> 39:51.220
This is all yours.
You're the owner of this world.

39:51.830 --> 39:53.940
Everything you see is yours.

39:54.560 --> 39:57.590
Oh, except that hole right there--
that's Ira's.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.230
But, I mean the tree's yours,
but the hole is Ira's.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.330
But everything else is yours...

40:02.380 --> 40:04.090
except that rock over there,
that's not yours,

40:04.140 --> 40:06.100
that little rock next to the big rock.

40:06.150 --> 40:09.050
But everything else in the kingdom,
except for that stick,

40:09.100 --> 40:12.150
that little stick right there,
that's not yours...

40:14.860 --> 40:17.160
I want you to be king forever Max.

40:18.330 --> 40:20.480
Yeah. Definitely.

40:25.380 --> 40:29.110
Well, this part of your kingdom
is not so good.

40:29.770 --> 40:30.640
Why?

40:31.290 --> 40:34.670
Look. This used to be all rock,
and now it's sand,

40:34.730 --> 40:37.760
And then one day it's gonna be dust.
And then the whole island will be dust.

40:37.810 --> 40:38.760
Then...

40:40.320 --> 40:43.270
And I don't even know
what comes after the dust.

40:49.150 --> 40:50.270
Carol?

40:51.190 --> 40:53.540
Did you know the sun was gonna die?

40:53.970 --> 40:54.860
What?

40:59.440 --> 41:01.350
I never heard that.

41:05.210 --> 41:06.410
Oh, come on!

41:08.120 --> 41:09.620
That can't happen.

41:10.890 --> 41:14.690
You're the king. And... look at me.
I'm big!

41:16.320 --> 41:20.900
How can guys like us worry about
a tiny little thing like the sun. Huh?

41:35.210 --> 41:36.860
Carol, what was that?

41:37.140 --> 41:38.640
Oh, it's that dog.

41:39.490 --> 41:42.240
Don't feed it,
it'll just follow you around.

41:51.380 --> 41:53.080
Carol, wait up for me!

42:40.160 --> 42:41.460
Wow.

42:51.710 --> 42:53.230
Did you make this?

42:54.420 --> 42:55.600
Yeah. Yeah.

42:57.030 --> 42:58.380
It's very good.

43:03.950 --> 43:06.650
We were gonna make
a whole world like this.

43:07.350 --> 43:09.550
Now, everyone used to come here,

43:10.560 --> 43:12.060
but you know...

43:13.920 --> 43:15.830
you know what it feels like
when all your teeth are

43:15.880 --> 43:18.080
falling out really slowly and...

43:19.230 --> 43:23.820
you don't realize and then you noticed
that they're really far apart

43:26.910 --> 43:28.750
And then one day...

43:30.580 --> 43:32.830
you don't have any teeth anymore.

43:34.870 --> 43:35.810
Yeah.

43:36.790 --> 43:38.790
Well it was like that.

43:40.230 --> 43:42.630
Alright, put your head right here.

43:43.430 --> 43:44.630
Right here.

43:56.610 --> 43:58.160
And now watch.

44:15.960 --> 44:18.760
Wow. I wish I could live in there.

44:19.520 --> 44:20.370
Yeah.

44:22.770 --> 44:27.370
It was gonna be a place where only things
you wanted to have happen would happen.

44:27.840 --> 44:28.720
Yeah.

44:29.720 --> 44:32.180
I guess if that's not going to happen,
I'll just probably end up

44:32.230 --> 44:33.780
eating my feet off.

44:41.420 --> 44:44.320
Carol, we can totally
build a place like that.

44:46.910 --> 44:49.720
- Really? - We're gonna start
with the perfect fort.

44:49.770 --> 44:52.180
And then we're gonna
build the city around it.

44:52.230 --> 44:53.890
Because you've gotta be realistic,

44:53.940 --> 44:56.360
I mean, when we started
with a perfect fort

44:56.410 --> 44:58.440
and then we're gonna build
the underground complex

44:58.490 --> 45:00.710
that's gonna tie everything together.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.510
I like your brain, Max.

45:04.020 --> 45:06.720
Hey! I'm not gonna eat
my feet off anymore.

45:06.890 --> 45:07.990
Why?

45:08.090 --> 45:09.410
Max is gonna build a fortress!

45:09.460 --> 45:12.710
Yeah, it's gonna be as tall as
twelve of you and six of me.

45:12.760 --> 45:15.750
And only we can get in.
We can have an ice cream parlor.

45:15.800 --> 45:18.280
A swimming pool with a bottom
that's also a trampoline.

45:18.330 --> 45:20.470
Hey, where were you?
We were just here.

45:20.520 --> 45:22.770
And anyone that gets in there
that we don't want there

45:22.820 --> 45:25.690
will get their brains cut out.
The building will do it automatically.

45:25.740 --> 45:27.480
How does it know which brains
to cut out?

45:27.530 --> 45:31.430
Okay, there will be a fake tree
but it's not a tree, it's a tunnel.

45:38.790 --> 45:41.490
So anyways, it's not a tree,
it's a tunnel,

45:41.610 --> 45:44.650
and it'll lead you into the fort
through a compartment.

45:44.700 --> 45:48.310
Ira, do you want to be in charge of the
tunnels because you make great holes?

45:48.360 --> 45:50.670
- Wow. Wow.
- I don't want my brains cut out!

45:50.720 --> 45:53.860
- This fort's already making me happy.
- Does anybody ever hear me?

45:53.910 --> 45:58.210
We'll take care of each other, and
we'll all sleep together in a real pile.

45:58.290 --> 46:02.090
- What do you think? - I don't think
anything like this ever works, really.

46:02.140 --> 46:05.730
But if it did.... I don't know,
I don't know. I don't know anything.

46:05.780 --> 46:07.610
But I do like sleeping in a real pile.

46:07.660 --> 46:10.220
Carol, will you be in charge
of building it?

46:10.270 --> 46:11.320
Oh. Uh...

46:11.590 --> 46:13.510
You should definitely
be in charge, Carol.

46:13.560 --> 46:14.890
You're the only one
who could pull it off.

46:14.940 --> 46:17.390
Yeah, well... You're right, but...

46:17.680 --> 46:20.680
K.W., don't you think that
Carol should build it?

46:21.190 --> 46:23.740
Yeah. He's the only one who can.

46:24.170 --> 46:25.820
I build it, if he doesn't want to.

46:25.870 --> 46:26.980
Well...

46:27.750 --> 46:29.090
Really want to do this?

46:29.140 --> 46:31.260
- Oh, yes.
- I think it's a perfect idea.

46:31.310 --> 46:36.040
Well, alright if you all want to do it,
and you want me,

46:37.590 --> 46:39.010
I'll be honored.

46:40.570 --> 46:43.370
- Judy, you would have
been good too. - Yeah.

46:59.740 --> 47:03.090
A little more that way. A little more.
Yeah right there.

47:13.370 --> 47:14.220
Yeah!

47:22.750 --> 47:25.710
- How about here? You like it here?
- Yeah. Put a mark there.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.790
One more put there and then we can
put the other mark over there.

47:28.840 --> 47:30.920
Yeah. A little more this way.

47:31.210 --> 47:32.720
It's five, Carol.

47:32.770 --> 47:35.630
And then seven Douglases across
we'll have the other mark.

47:35.680 --> 47:37.340
- What have you been eating?
- Rocks.

47:37.390 --> 47:39.220
Rocks? What did I tell you
about eating rocks?

47:39.270 --> 47:41.370
- That's six.
- You're getting a little paunch.

47:41.420 --> 47:42.410
Hey Douglas.

47:42.460 --> 47:44.570
- Hey, K.W..
- Hey, King.

47:44.880 --> 47:45.710
How about here?

47:45.760 --> 47:48.660
It needs seven Douglas's,
no more, and no less.

47:49.210 --> 47:51.450
- Seven chubby Douglases.
- Hey, Carol.

47:51.500 --> 47:55.990
It's gonna be part castle, part fort,
part mountain, and part ship.

47:56.900 --> 48:00.750
We'll have a laboratory so we can
build robots to do stuff for us,

48:01.270 --> 48:05.000
our own detective agency,
and our own language.

48:05.210 --> 48:09.960
And we'll make a machine that can take
our legs off and that way we can float.

48:12.700 --> 48:14.180
Alright, Carol!

48:14.560 --> 48:15.710
You smiled.

48:16.250 --> 48:18.540
You can't deny that was a good idea.

48:18.590 --> 48:20.040
I didn't deny it.

48:21.420 --> 48:23.870
I believe part of that idea was mine.

48:25.290 --> 48:26.450
What part?

48:26.650 --> 48:29.250
The part where I said,
"Yeah. Good idea."

48:44.160 --> 48:46.140
I got it! I got it.

48:59.970 --> 49:02.840
I like the tunnel, Ira. Impressive!

49:03.340 --> 49:05.140
Oh! Why thank you, King.

49:08.400 --> 49:10.850
Great beams, Douglas. Strong.

49:12.360 --> 49:15.850
Thanks. They're just the standard beams
I always do.

50:16.430 --> 50:18.540
What were you doing with Carol just now?

50:18.590 --> 50:20.190
Just talking.

50:20.520 --> 50:22.390
Oh, a secret, huh?

50:23.030 --> 50:25.200
Well let me ask you something.
How does it work around here?

50:25.250 --> 50:28.030
Are we all the same,
or are some of us better than others?

50:28.080 --> 50:29.790
You like to play favorites, huh, King?

50:29.840 --> 50:30.590
Ow.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.580
No. I like all you guys equally.

50:33.630 --> 50:36.400
Don't give me that!
I can see how it is!

50:36.510 --> 50:38.880
The King has a favorites,
that's really cute.

50:38.930 --> 50:40.380
Ow. Stop.

50:40.450 --> 50:44.200
Do you have a favorite color?
Hey, can I be your favorite color?

51:04.650 --> 51:06.230
You know what?

51:06.520 --> 51:08.570
You can't do that back to me.

51:09.020 --> 51:12.050
If we're upset, your job is
not to get upset back at us.

51:12.100 --> 51:14.060
Our job is to be upset.

51:14.690 --> 51:17.140
If I get mad and want to eat you,
then you have to say,

51:17.190 --> 51:22.620
"Oh, okay! You can eat me! I love you!
Whatever makes you happy, Judith."

51:23.110 --> 51:25.410
That's what you're supposed to do.

51:28.170 --> 51:30.250
Come on, Max.
Let's go get those sticks.

51:30.300 --> 51:32.210
Yeah... okay.

51:32.630 --> 51:34.530
I hope you heard me, King.

51:34.970 --> 51:35.590
Ow.

51:35.640 --> 51:38.890
Yeah, he heard you, Judith.
Everyone always hears you.

51:41.540 --> 51:44.790
You think you have power, K.W.?
That's not real power.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.740
I'm talking to you!

51:49.090 --> 51:51.630
No. Not you.
Still talking to K.W.!

51:58.950 --> 52:02.110
Don't worry about Judith.
She's a downer.

52:03.967 --> 52:05.767
Now you figure it out.

52:06.260 --> 52:09.040
Hey, you should talk to
Bob and Terry about it.

52:09.090 --> 52:10.600
Come on!

52:11.400 --> 52:12.680
King!

52:18.180 --> 52:20.380
Seriously, they're really smart.

52:20.550 --> 52:22.950
They have the answers to everything.

53:27.820 --> 53:30.270
Hold on, hold on, I'm coming!

53:38.300 --> 53:40.400
Well, what do you think?

53:44.960 --> 53:46.690
This is Bob and Terry.

53:49.330 --> 53:51.780
They love it, when I do this to them.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.810
Bob, Terry, this is the Max,

53:55.260 --> 53:57.810
he's the biter I was telling you about.

53:59.930 --> 54:00.880
Say hi.

54:01.770 --> 54:02.520
Hi.

54:03.860 --> 54:06.360
He wanted to ask you guys some advice.

54:08.970 --> 54:11.220
Go ahead, they're not judgmental.

54:12.150 --> 54:14.620
You mean just ask them?

54:15.150 --> 54:16.110
Yeah.

54:17.740 --> 54:21.940
They say it's better for you, if you
can ask the question in seven words.

54:23.990 --> 54:26.210
Um... Okay... Um...

54:34.260 --> 54:35.850
How.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.500
Do.

54:39.230 --> 54:40.520
I. Make.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.440
Everyone.

54:47.400 --> 54:48.560
O. Kay.

54:52.450 --> 54:54.700
Oh, yeah. I didn't think of that.

54:56.810 --> 54:59.890
Wow, they really get to the heart
of it, don't they?

54:59.940 --> 55:01.440
Aren't they great?

55:02.540 --> 55:04.310
What if they came
and lived with us?

55:04.360 --> 55:06.310
Bob, Terry, why don't you
come live with us?

55:06.360 --> 55:08.510
We're building something great!

55:09.630 --> 55:12.000
Oh good! Right Max?

55:15.710 --> 55:17.160
What about Carol?

55:17.900 --> 55:19.170
He's Carol.

55:21.490 --> 55:24.790
I can like him and still be friends
with Bob and Terry.

55:45.310 --> 55:46.580
Hey, Douglas!

55:47.440 --> 55:49.100
Hey! Where's Carol?

55:49.630 --> 55:53.750
He's in the fort.
Aft section, main chamber.

56:04.130 --> 56:06.320
Carol! Carol! The fort looks great!

56:06.370 --> 56:09.520
Yeah, thanks, we were all
working really hard on it.

56:09.950 --> 56:11.550
Where have you been?

56:12.170 --> 56:14.720
K.W. took me to see her friends
Bob and Terry.

56:14.770 --> 56:17.920
They really wanna meet you.
They may even stay over.

56:23.878 --> 56:26.328
Oh, this is the famous Bob and Terry?

56:26.520 --> 56:28.850
What? K.W. told you about me?

56:28.900 --> 56:30.950
- Hey, guys.
- What'd she say?

56:32.800 --> 56:36.300
- Really? - Oh, precious!
Little Bob and Terry get carried!

56:37.240 --> 56:39.700
Excuse me. My voice?
Oh, thank you!

56:40.070 --> 56:42.170
Thank you. Well, sometimes...

56:46.250 --> 56:49.190
I know. I know.
I'm a very lucky man.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.690
Hey. Hey, do you guys know any jokes?

56:54.970 --> 56:56.660
Who's there?

56:56.880 --> 56:58.980
Loud interrupting cow wh--

57:00.750 --> 57:02.250
That's hilarious!

57:03.310 --> 57:04.880
They're amazing, K.W.

57:04.930 --> 57:07.130
Max, what's wrong with the fort?

57:07.780 --> 57:09.890
I though you said it'd be automatic.

57:09.940 --> 57:10.840
What?

57:10.890 --> 57:13.920
I thought you said if anybody
got in here we didn't want,

57:13.970 --> 57:16.460
the fort would automatically
cut their brains out.

57:16.510 --> 57:17.460
Carol?

57:17.980 --> 57:19.480
Oh, well...

57:20.790 --> 57:22.740
I thought that then, but...

57:23.600 --> 57:27.770
I kinda decided that if we know them,
they should keep their brains.

57:31.830 --> 57:34.380
Even if we don't know them that well...

57:36.560 --> 57:39.200
I think you should apologize
to Bob and Terry.

57:39.250 --> 57:42.410
I don't apologize to owls.
Owls are stupid.

57:43.410 --> 57:45.350
Carol, that's hateful.

57:46.240 --> 57:48.270
Why did you bring them here?

57:50.480 --> 57:52.930
This place was supposed to be for us!

57:53.670 --> 57:55.920
They're not sleeping in our pile!

58:01.900 --> 58:04.730
Gee, you're the best king ever.

58:05.050 --> 58:06.950
You've changed everything.

58:30.110 --> 58:31.350
Hey Carol.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.810
I don't get why she likes them so much.

58:37.680 --> 58:40.170
And I couldn't even understand,
what they were saying,

58:40.220 --> 58:42.270
all I heard was squeaking.

58:46.820 --> 58:50.270
I couldn't really understand
what they were saying either.

58:50.570 --> 58:52.060
- Really?
- Yeah.

58:57.470 --> 58:59.170
Everybody's mad at me.

59:05.040 --> 59:07.340
Is there anything you can do to...

59:07.880 --> 59:09.270
you know...

59:13.420 --> 59:17.370
There's something I like to do,
that sometimes makes me feel better.

59:19.310 --> 59:20.490
What is it?

59:21.850 --> 59:26.440
Okay. We're gonna have a war! And we
are gonna completely clobber each other!

59:27.510 --> 59:30.680
- Clobber each other?
- Yeah, with huge dirt clods.

59:31.130 --> 59:33.630
I used to do it a ton
when I was a little kid.

59:33.680 --> 59:36.860
Yeah, we haven't had a dirt clod fight
in a long time...

59:36.910 --> 59:38.890
Yeah. It's the best way
to have a fun together.

59:38.940 --> 59:42.210
Yeah. Life was simpler back then,
with the dirt clods.

59:42.290 --> 59:44.840
- Yeah.
- So, who wants to be a bad guy?

59:48.700 --> 59:51.060
Okay. I'll pick one then.

59:52.650 --> 59:55.530
- Okay you're a bad guy.
- Yeah, saw that coming.

59:55.580 --> 59:58.390
...And then you're definitely a bad guy.

59:58.490 --> 01:00:00.980
- What? Ah... Damn.
- And you can pick one other.

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.970
Ummm... I'm bad... really.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:04.730
- Okay. We pick you.
- No.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:08.080
No, I can't be a bad guy.
I'm the king. I'm a good guy.

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.920
I'm a bad guy! I'm a bad guy!

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:11.870
- Okay. You can be a bad guy.
- I'm a bad guy!

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.020
- Judy, I'm with you.
- Yeah. I heard.

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:15.470
And you... uh...

01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:20.190
- He's with you.
- And am I a good guy?

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.770
Yes, of course, you have the best arm.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.620
Hey, where were you?

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:27.330
I'm just making sure, Bob and Terry
still have their brains.

01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.430
- K.W.!
- They do.

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:32.920
Hey K.W.! You wanna be on my team?
With the bad guys..

01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:35.970
No! No-no, no. You're with us.
You're a good guy.

01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:39.850
Hey, come on.
K.W., be a good guy.

01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:44.630
Okay. So, you're on my team.
You and me and Carol.

01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.110
Hi, K.W.

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:53.250
So what we are gonna do is we're
gonna try to kill the bad guys...

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.410
by beaning them in the head
with these dirt clods.

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:59.260
We're gonna try to find
the biggest pieces...

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.200
- You didn't see that coming!
- Get out!

01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:05.080
- Rumpus!
- Yeah. You'd better run!

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:08.730
Oh, Wait! We didn't make
the official starting noise!

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:12.330
Alright, come on!

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.120
Look out for the bad guys!

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.970
We got them pinned down!
They can't even move!

01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:32.840
- Fire on three!
- Okay!

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:36.110
One, two, three!

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.340
You guys are gonna...

01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.580
Wait-wait-wait-wait!
I have an idea!

01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:50.400
Come out!

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.070
No!

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.190
Why not?

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:59.490
Ahh, because you're gonna hit us
in the head with dirt.

01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:01.770
Come out!

01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:04.680
Nooo!

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.500
Why not?

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.500
Because when I said you were gonna
hit us in the head with dirt,

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:09.860
you didn't say anything.

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:13.410
That means you're planning to hit us
in the head with dirt.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:17.960
Man, they really have us figured out.

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:19.260
Yeah.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.150
Okay! Let's go!

01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:23.830
Charge!

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:26.380
C'mon!

01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:28.485
Ira! Get Carol.

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.870
Ooh, good shot. I'm gonna get you!

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:49.180
Hey, who threw Richard?
He's on our team now.

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:54.690
- Gotcha!
- No animals!

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.520
Owww! It really hurts. It's hurting!

01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.730
Yeah! Come on!

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.990
- Hey, Douglas. Get the goat.
- Okay.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.290
- Knock his legs down.
- I got it.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.450
Owww!

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.890
That's cheating.
I'm not gonna play anymore.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:19.390
- Alexander come on! Fight with us!
- Do it again. - Okay.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.630
That's... That's not fair.

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.330
- Are you crazy?! - Alexander you
are supposed to get hit, it's a war.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.680
That wasn't fair. Douglas hit me,
when I was hurt.

01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:29.810
You can't hit someone,
when they're hurt.

01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:31.850
- I quit.
- Get back in here right now.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.505
Alex! Count to ten.

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:34.990
- Things will be better.
- Alex, better don't you cry!

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:37.080
If I count to ten then
you'll be gone Ira?

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:40.170
- Don't you dare talk to Ira
the way I do! - Knock it off!

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.940
Owww! That's my eye!

01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.510
Hey! Come on!

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.800
Get out! Now!

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.420
Yeah!

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.990
Oh! Carol, sorry.

01:04:06.970 --> 01:04:09.770
What happened? Somebody stepped
on your head?

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:12.010
What are you doing?

01:04:12.550 --> 01:04:13.400
What?

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.250
You stepped on my head!

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:18.500
What do you mean? It's a war.
Douglas just did it.

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:21.870
Yeah but he did by accident.
You did it on purpose!

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.040
And he didn't step on
the face part of my head!

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.075
It was a joke.

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.260
I was just joking.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.780
Sure you were.

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:35.910
Like you aren't always looking for
an opportunity to step on my head.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.870
'Cause that's what you do.

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:43.520
Fine, fine. You know what?

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:47.440
This is exactly why I never don't want
to do anything with you anymore.

01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:48.720
Go ahead.

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:51.110
Step on my head.

01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:54.050
No. Forget it. I'm not going
to step on your head

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.150
just to make you feel better.

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:01.220
Let's go, Douglas.

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:03.870
Carol, I think you did the right thing,

01:05:03.990 --> 01:05:06.370
you know, not stepping on her head.

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:30.780
Thanks, Max. But I'm done.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.940
I don't know, why I came back here.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.070
I'm glad I met you, I guess.

01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:53.420
So King. What's going on?

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:56.410
This is how you rule a kingdom?
Everyone fighting?

01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:59.700
The bad guys feel bad.
Hell. Everyone feels bad.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.970
Yeah. I'm still sorta dizzy
and my eyeballs feel loose.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:07.850
Oh can it, Ira.
Everyone's eyeballs feel loose.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:08.720
No!

01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:15.200
Max will bring K.W. back.
He'll keep us all together.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.410
He has powers. He told us.

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:20.300
Right, Max?

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:22.290
Show us.

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:52.390
Oh, somebody broke the king.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.650
I don't get it.

01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:56.780
Oh wait, I do. It's stupid.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.010
I think he's done now.

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:05.890
That's what we waited for?

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:51.110
Carol?

01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:08.180
Hi.

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.060
Is that from the dirt clods?

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.439
Yeah,

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:49.979
it's from when you had Douglas hit me.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.370
I'm sorry about that.

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:01.130
It's okay.

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.540
No one really listens to you, huh?

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.820
Oh, you've noticed.

01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:15.670
Yeah. I guess you're not...
used to that being a king and all.

01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:26.480
I really messed this place up.

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:35.780
You're not really a king, huh?

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.890
You're just regular.

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:46.050
I knew it.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.780
I don't even know
if there's such a thing as...

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:54.110
a king who can do all the things
you said.

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:57.520
Look,

01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:59.560
I don't care,

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.670
just don't ever let Carol find out.

01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.830
Hey, Max.

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.500
What's that?

01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:59.570
Well, I was thinking we needed a place

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.880
where the king is secret.

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:05.550
Like a secret chamber for the king.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.430
Well, I don't understand... What...

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.550
Well, you know like a...
like a small place.

01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:13.760
With a door that's not so big.

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:16.910
I don't know...

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.630
I didn't picture it with
a secret doors.

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:27.350
What if it were a big place
with big secret doors.

01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:33.140
That's not really how it would be done.

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:36.300
It's more like... it's like a...

01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:43.940
About that big?

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.260
Everybody get out here!

01:12:58.820 --> 01:12:59.890
Wake up.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.540
Everybody wake up!

01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:05.150
And get out of here!

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.790
- Ira, what is that?
- Everybody wake up!

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.120
It's Carol.

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:13.010
Oh, I knew it was gonna happen.

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:16.720
It's all wrong. It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:19.150
Judith, what's happening right now?

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.170
Judith?

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:21.870
Wake up and come out here.

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:23.020
What is it?

01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:24.320
Get out here!

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.440
It's wrong!

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:28.830
- I can't even look at it.
- What is it?

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.150
The fort. We gotta tear the fort down.

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:32.030
What?

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.380
- It wasn't supposed to be like this.
- No, Carol!

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:37.350
You said we were all going to
sleep together in a real pile,

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.770
and now you want a secret room
and K.W. is gone for good

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:42.780
And now I have to worry
if the sun is gonna die.

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:44.540
- The sun?
- Look at it. It didn't come up!

01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:46.150
- It's dead.
- What?

01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:47.420
- Oh my God!
- Dead!

01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:49.420
- Carol, stop it!
- It's dead! It's dead.

01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:51.700
- You're scaring everybody.
- It's morning.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.660
The sun's not dead. It's just nighttime.

01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:56.510
How do you know?
I can't trust, what you say.

01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:58.790
Everything keeps changing.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.200
Oh, come on, Douglas.
We're ripping it down.

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:02.170
Carol, we're not ripping the fort down!

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.150
It was supposed to be a place
where only things you wanted

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.990
to have happen would happen.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.580
Come on Douglas, do what I tell you.

01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:10.340
No! We all live here, not just you.

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:14.550
It's everybody's.
It's Judith, and Ira, and everybody.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.670
Oh, finally!

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.170
You were supposed
to keep us safe.

01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.030
You were supposed to take
care of us, and you didn't.

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.530
- Carol.
- I'm sorry!

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:22.580
- That's not good enough.
- Carol.

01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:24.190
You're a terrible King!

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:25.750
- Carol!
- What?

01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:28.660
He's not our King.

01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:29.560
What?

01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:31.410
Don't say that.

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:33.450
How could you say that?
Don't you dare say that.

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.720
There's no such thing as a king.

01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.600
Don't you say that!

01:14:37.650 --> 01:14:42.180
He's just a boy pretending to be
a wolf pretending to be a king.

01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:44.490
- That's not true!
- He's just like us.

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.420
- Ahh! Why don't I listen to myself?
- No! No!

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:47.630
That's not true!

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.190
Look, I just went along with it because
I knew you wanted it so much.

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.420
- Don't say that!
- No! Carol, stop it!

01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:54.930
- Carol.
- Oww!!

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:56.650
Stop it!
What are you doing?

01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:57.720
- Carol!
- What?

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:01.530
- That was my favorite arm.
- Well, I was just holding on to it.

01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:02.730
- You pulled away.
- What?

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:04.624
- Carol, stop it!
- You lied!

01:15:04.674 --> 01:15:07.020
- You're out of control!
- I am not out of control!

01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:09.830
You were supposed to take
care of us. You promised.

01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.420
I'll eat you up!

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:30.480
Come back, Max!

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.770
Max!

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:38.400
Max!

01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:44.480
C'mon. C'mere.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.430
Get in, get inside!

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.190
Get in. Crawl inside my mouth.
I'll hide you!

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:12.070
- Hi, Richard.
- Max.

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.530
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:16.750
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.200
I can smell him!

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:21.800
I just want to talk to him.

01:16:21.850 --> 01:16:24.550
- You're out of control!
- I'm not out of control!

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:27.500
- You were going to eat him!
- No, no... I wa--

01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:30.990
I wasn't going to...
I do not know... I just said it.

01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:39.170
Am I as bad as he says I am?

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.930
Just go away.

01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:46.560
I just wanted us all to be together...

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.260
Can you believe him?

01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:12.550
He doesn't mean to be that way,  K.W.

01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:19.780
He's just scared.

01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.880
Well, he only makes it harder.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.930
And it's hard enough already.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.050
But he loves you.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.780
You're his family.

01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:43.640
Yeah.

01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:46.980
It's hard being a family.

01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:57.730
I can't breathe that well in here.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.650
Can you get me out?

01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:38.730
I wish you guys had a mom.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.790
I'm gonna go home.

01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:14.010
Carol!

01:20:23.530 --> 01:20:24.470
Max.

01:20:31.700 --> 01:20:34.680
Well... Umm... Yeah.

01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:38.750
Yeah.

01:20:50.330 --> 01:20:53.180
So whatever happened with you
and the Vikings?

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:59.090
Well, in the end, I had to leave.

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:00.980
Why?

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.150
I'm not a Viking or a king or...

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.340
anything.

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:14.700
So what are you?

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.240
I'm Max.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:31.220
Well, that's not very much, is it?

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.820
Hey Max?

01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:08.660
Yeah?

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.990
When you go home will you say
good things about us?

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.830
Yeah, I will.

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.020
Thanks, Max.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.410
You're the first king
we haven't eaten.

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.110
Yeah, that's true.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:22:59.550
See ya.

01:23:00.250 --> 01:23:01.570
Bye, Max.

01:23:01.930 --> 01:23:03.020
Bye.

01:24:57.630 --> 01:24:58.680
Don't go.

01:24:59.570 --> 01:25:01.720
I'll eat you up, I love you so.
