WEBVTT

00:11.378 --> 00:13.880
You're traveling
through another dimension-

00:13.915 --> 00:17.017
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

00:17.052 --> 00:18.885
a journey into a wondrous land

00:18.920 --> 00:20.770
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

00:20.805 --> 00:23.273
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

00:57.057 --> 00:58.308
She's all set,
mr. Radin.

00:58.343 --> 01:00.176
How about the
sound system?

01:00.211 --> 01:01.428
You check that out?

01:01.463 --> 01:02.679
She's all
ready to go.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.815
I don't know where you
got your sound effects

01:05.850 --> 01:08.318
but you'd swear
a bomb was exploding.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.186
I mean a big bomb.

01:10.221 --> 01:12.689
That's precisely the way
it's supposed to sound.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.712
That about do it,
mr. Radin?

01:35.747 --> 01:36.963
That about does it.

01:36.998 --> 01:38.848
You got quite
a setup here.

01:38.883 --> 01:40.717
This part of
the illusion too?

01:41.351 --> 01:43.219
No, this room is
not an illusion.

01:43.254 --> 01:45.105
I venture to guess

01:45.140 --> 01:46.356
that it's the best
designed bomb shelter

01:46.391 --> 01:49.476
on the face of the
earth- who knows?

01:49.511 --> 01:52.612
The hydrogen bomb
is not an illusion.

01:52.647 --> 01:55.115
But tonight it's
for gags, huh?

01:55.150 --> 01:56.366
Something of the sort.

01:56.401 --> 01:58.868
A practical joke,
let's say.

01:58.903 --> 02:00.120
You can say
that again.

02:00.155 --> 02:01.988
When they start
those sound effects

02:02.023 --> 02:03.873
and that stuff
on the screen

02:03.908 --> 02:06.376
you'd swear the world
was getting blasted.

02:06.411 --> 02:07.627
That's the idea.

02:07.662 --> 02:10.130
I have three guests
coming this evening;

02:10.164 --> 02:11.748
rather special
guests.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.884
You did this to fool
three of your friends?

02:14.919 --> 02:17.253
Must be kind of
special friends.

02:17.288 --> 02:20.390
They are; they are, indeed-
very special friends.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.398
What you have just looked at

02:28.433 --> 02:30.900
takes place 300 feet
underground,

02:30.935 --> 02:34.654
beneath the basement of
a new york city skyscraper.

02:34.689 --> 02:37.157
It's owned and lived in
by one paul radin.

02:37.192 --> 02:40.276
Mr. Radin is rich, eccentric
and single-minded-

02:40.311 --> 02:42.779
how rich,
we can already perceive.

02:42.814 --> 02:46.533
How eccentric and single-minded,
we shall see in a moment,

02:46.568 --> 02:49.035
because all of you
have just entered

02:49.070 --> 02:50.920
the twilight zone.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.614
Good evening, friends.

03:17.649 --> 03:20.733
Just step across the hall to
the door straight ahead of you.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.749
Please come in, if you will.

03:38.001 --> 03:41.137
Sit down, make
yourselves comfortable.

03:53.051 --> 03:54.267
Please sit down.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.167
How good of
you to come.

04:11.202 --> 04:13.670
Colonel hawthorne,
mr. Hughes,

04:13.705 --> 04:14.921
mrs. Langsford.

04:14.956 --> 04:16.172
It's radin,
isn't it?

04:18.041 --> 04:20.543
Aren't you paul radin?

04:20.577 --> 04:23.046
You have an excellent
memory, reverend.

04:23.081 --> 04:25.548
And you, colonel,
do you recognize me?

04:25.583 --> 04:26.799
I believe i do.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.936
Served under me once,
didn't you, radin?

04:29.971 --> 04:32.438
I did indeed, second lieutenant,
infantry regiment

04:33.056 --> 04:35.558
under your command,
africa, 1942.

04:35.593 --> 04:37.443
I recall it vaguely.

04:37.478 --> 04:41.197
I seem to recall
something else too.

04:41.232 --> 04:44.317
It's not surprising it
doesn't flood back to you.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.202
You had a few thousand
men under you.

04:46.237 --> 04:47.453
I was only one.

04:47.488 --> 04:51.207
But then again, you didn't
court-martial all of them.

04:51.242 --> 04:53.710
That distinction
you reserved for me.

04:53.745 --> 04:54.961
Ah, yes, i do recall.

04:54.996 --> 04:58.081
You refused to lead
an assault on a hill;

04:58.715 --> 05:01.217
refused in the face
of a direct order.

05:01.252 --> 05:04.337
The delay cost us
almost a company of men.

05:04.372 --> 05:07.473
That was your contention
to the court-martial board,

05:07.508 --> 05:09.976
and so i was stripped of rank,
dishonorably discharged.

05:10.011 --> 05:11.594
You were fortunate,
mr. Radin.

05:11.629 --> 05:13.479
Were i to have
dictated the sentence

05:13.514 --> 05:14.731
i would have had you shot.

05:14.766 --> 05:16.849
I'm sure you would have,
colonel.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.851
I'm sure you
would have.

05:18.886 --> 05:24.607
But what a wretched host i am
to neglect the lady present.

05:24.642 --> 05:25.858
Mrs. Langsford.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.863
Do you recall
who i am?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.115
Of course,
i do, paul.

05:32.150 --> 05:34.000
I taught you
in high school.

05:34.035 --> 05:35.868
I don't forget
my students.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.622
Oh, sometimes the names
and the faces get confused

05:39.657 --> 05:41.507
but if i prod my memory

05:41.542 --> 05:44.010
i usually can connect
a name and a face-

05:44.045 --> 05:47.130
and, in your case, a character.

05:47.165 --> 05:49.632
You flunked me, mrs. Langsford;

05:49.667 --> 05:52.135
dressed me down
before an entire class;

05:52.170 --> 05:54.637
called me names, humiliated me.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.142
Well, let
me say again,

05:59.177 --> 06:01.027
how good of
you to come.

06:01.062 --> 06:02.278
I'm delighted

06:02.313 --> 06:04.147
you accepted
the invitation.

06:04.182 --> 06:06.032
Invitation?

06:06.067 --> 06:09.152
The request that i come here
was an ultimatum.

06:09.187 --> 06:11.654
Your chauffeur said
it was a matter

06:11.689 --> 06:12.905
of life and death.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.791
Well, yes, yes, indeed.

06:14.826 --> 06:16.659
That's the way it
was broached to me.

06:16.694 --> 06:18.544
I was having my dinner

06:18.579 --> 06:22.298
and my wife mary went
to answer the door,

06:22.333 --> 06:24.167
and when she came back,

06:24.202 --> 06:27.920
she had such a strange
expression on her face.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.806
Ah, mr. Hughes,
you've never ceased

06:29.841 --> 06:32.925
to be a bit on the wordy
side, now, have you?

06:32.960 --> 06:36.062
It's odd, really, how changeless
we remain over the years.

06:36.097 --> 06:38.564
But then again, i suppose
certain lifetime habits

06:38.599 --> 06:40.433
are not easily put aside.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.318
Paul, perhaps you'd be
good enough to tell us

06:42.353 --> 06:44.187
why we've been asked
to come here.

06:44.222 --> 06:45.438
I'd be delighted to.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.940
But first,
can i get you something?

06:47.975 --> 06:50.443
A highball, perhaps...

06:51.077 --> 06:52.328
or a cup of coffee?

06:52.363 --> 06:55.448
Reverend, how do you
take your coffee?

06:55.483 --> 06:57.333
Habits, mrs. Langsford-

06:57.368 --> 07:00.453
the incredible
persistence of habits.

07:00.488 --> 07:03.589
You call me paul, as if
i were still sitting

07:03.624 --> 07:06.709
in the front row
in your classroom.

07:06.744 --> 07:08.594
But what about you,
mrs. Langsford?

07:08.629 --> 07:09.846
A nice cup of tea?

07:09.881 --> 07:11.097
Thank you, no.

07:11.132 --> 07:12.348
Oh?

07:12.383 --> 07:14.217
How about you, colonel-
a tot of rum, perhaps?

07:14.252 --> 07:15.468
I would appreciate

07:15.503 --> 07:17.970
if you made your point
and let us leave.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.107
You've obviously called
us here for something

07:21.142 --> 07:23.609
and i would welcome
hearing whatever it is.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.478
How staunchly military, colonel.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.363
Drive, drive, drive!

07:27.398 --> 07:29.866
Get up against that objective
and wipe it out.

07:29.901 --> 07:31.117
Red flag in the map

07:31.152 --> 07:32.985
and troops
out of the sun.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.738
The nerves of steel
and a concrete head.

07:35.773 --> 07:36.989
That will
be all, radin!

07:37.024 --> 07:40.376
Colonel, you are
no longer in command.

07:40.411 --> 07:40.993
I'm in command here

07:41.028 --> 07:43.496
and what i command
is your attention.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.999
I called you
three here

07:47.034 --> 07:48.885
for a very
specific purpose.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.004
I want to settle
three old scores

07:52.039 --> 07:53.890
but will do it
in chronology.

07:53.925 --> 07:57.009
My dear old schoolmarm
shall begin-

07:57.044 --> 08:00.146
that staunch and
intrepid educator

08:00.181 --> 08:02.265
that looks so
out of place

08:02.300 --> 08:04.150
without her
severe spectacles

08:04.185 --> 08:05.401
covering severe eyes

08:05.436 --> 08:07.270
looking out of
a severe face

08:07.305 --> 08:08.521
and possessing

08:08.556 --> 08:11.023
that vast prerogative that comes
from the school board,

08:11.058 --> 08:12.275
and the vast courage

08:12.310 --> 08:15.411
that comes with pitting all her
wits and instinct and knowledge

08:15.446 --> 08:17.280
against captive children.

08:17.315 --> 08:18.531
Are you finished, paul?

08:18.566 --> 08:22.919
My dear schoolmarm,
i've hardly begun.

08:22.954 --> 08:25.421
Well, then, may i make
an observation?

08:25.456 --> 08:26.672
Just a comment

08:26.707 --> 08:29.792
on how incredible
this whole thing is

08:29.827 --> 08:33.546
that a man like you,
a millionaire three times over,

08:33.581 --> 08:37.299
an important man who walks
with kings and heads of state

08:37.335 --> 08:39.184
and industrial
tycoons-

08:39.220 --> 08:42.304
that such a man should
have a mind so tiny

08:42.340 --> 08:44.190
that it could brood

08:44.225 --> 08:46.692
over a high school incident
of 20 years ago

08:47.310 --> 08:50.446
and let it fester inside you
as you seem to have done.

08:50.481 --> 08:52.949
I have never liked humiliation,

08:52.984 --> 08:57.320
whether it happened 20 years ago
or in the past ten minutes.

08:57.355 --> 08:58.571
Humiliation?

08:58.606 --> 09:02.325
All right, paul, let's
talk about humiliation.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.827
Let's talk about
your humiliation.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.581
Mr. Radin was caught

09:08.616 --> 09:10.583
cheating in
an examination.

09:10.618 --> 09:11.834
Not a crime,
of course,

09:11.869 --> 09:15.588
but perhaps a bit indicative
of the character

09:15.623 --> 09:17.473
of the person who does it.

09:17.508 --> 09:19.342
And when he was accused
of this act,

09:19.976 --> 09:23.729
this cocoon-
soon to become tycoon-

09:23.764 --> 09:28.100
tried to plant his crib sheets
on an innocent student.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.986
How right you are,

09:30.021 --> 09:32.488
mr. Radin, that i stood you
up on your feet

09:32.523 --> 09:34.357
and in front of
the entire class

09:34.392 --> 09:38.110
i told you exactly
what you were.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.613
But no room was there
then, mrs. Langsford,

09:40.648 --> 09:42.498
for a moment of compassion,

09:42.533 --> 09:44.367
for an iota of sympathy

09:44.402 --> 09:46.869
for a poor, frightened,
desperate boy.

09:46.904 --> 09:48.120
Mr. Radin, i've dealt

09:48.155 --> 09:50.623
with frightened and desperate
children all my life.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.125
And it may surprise you to know

09:53.160 --> 09:55.127
that i've lent them
more of sympathy

09:55.162 --> 09:56.379
and of compassion

09:56.414 --> 09:58.764
than i have lent
them of knowledge.

09:58.799 --> 10:02.518
But neither sympathy nor
compassion can be handed out

10:02.553 --> 10:05.021
wholesale,
like cheap bubble gum.

10:05.056 --> 10:07.523
The recipient must
be worthy of them

10:07.558 --> 10:09.525
and you never were.

10:09.560 --> 10:14.530
You were a devious,
dishonest troublemaker.

10:14.565 --> 10:17.533
And in spite of
all your millions,

10:17.568 --> 10:21.287
it's my guess you are still
devious,

10:21.322 --> 10:23.155
you are still dishonest.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.658
And i've no doubt, even now,

10:25.693 --> 10:27.410
you're
a troublemaker.

10:28.661 --> 10:31.797
You haven't changed,
mrs. Langsford.

10:31.832 --> 10:36.168
Mr. Radin, obviously
many years have passed

10:36.203 --> 10:39.922
between now and the time you
felt you'd suffered indignities

10:39.957 --> 10:42.425
at our hands,
but what's to be gained by...

10:42.460 --> 10:44.927
a great deal can
be gained, reverend.

10:44.962 --> 10:46.178
A very great deal.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.681
You, for example, accused me
of a lack of character,

10:48.716 --> 10:51.183
put a scandal over my head,
destroyed my reputation.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.435
Yes, i remember.

10:52.470 --> 10:57.440
A girl, mr. Radin,
a girl you drove to suicide.

10:57.475 --> 11:01.444
Because even at
that early stage

11:01.479 --> 11:05.331
you were not a man who held
honor in very high regard.

11:05.366 --> 11:08.451
You can go
to the devil, reverend!

11:08.486 --> 11:09.452
Radin!

11:09.487 --> 11:10.703
And you, too, colonel.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.954
Tonight,
my friends,

11:11.989 --> 11:13.205
you will all
go to the devil,

11:13.240 --> 11:14.957
and that is not a
figure of speech!

11:18.094 --> 11:20.596
Do you know why i built
this room down here?

11:20.631 --> 11:24.967
Those walls are 18
inches concrete with
reinforced steel.

11:25.002 --> 11:27.470
And around them,
six inches of lead.

11:27.505 --> 11:31.857
I have my own generator
system, my own air system.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.977
Yes, and out there,
beyond that door,

11:35.012 --> 11:38.114
a storeroom the size
of a warehouse.

11:39.982 --> 11:41.867
You understand
logistics, colonel.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.370
Does it occur toyouwhy i
should have gone to all this

11:44.405 --> 11:46.238
trouble and expense?

11:51.877 --> 11:54.997
To begin a vigil, my friends.

11:55.032 --> 11:58.751
The long wait and the countdown.

11:58.786 --> 12:02.505
Yes. I have walked
with kings and tycoons,

12:02.540 --> 12:03.756
as you perceive, mrs. Langsford.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.892
I have walked with them,
and i have listened to them.

12:06.927 --> 12:10.646
I keep abreast of the times,
and usually well ahead of them.

12:10.681 --> 12:12.515
I know things
that are going to happen.

12:12.550 --> 12:14.400
I pay for the service.

12:14.517 --> 12:15.768
48 hours ago

12:15.803 --> 12:18.270
i received a most
interesting bit of news,

12:18.305 --> 12:21.407
something that
perhaps only six men

12:21.442 --> 12:23.909
in the world know of...

12:23.944 --> 12:27.029
the world is coming
to an end this evening,

12:27.064 --> 12:30.783
ladies and gentlemen.

12:31.417 --> 12:35.287
At 11:45, there will be no
more city, no more country.

12:35.322 --> 12:39.675
At 30 minutes after midnight,
there will be no more world.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.677
They are going
to bomb us,

12:41.712 --> 12:44.180
and we are going
to bomb them.

12:44.215 --> 12:48.684
By dawn, there will be nothing
left but rubble and bodies.

12:50.553 --> 12:53.055
And in a few moments
it will all begin.

12:53.090 --> 12:56.192
You'll be hearing
sirens very shortly-

12:56.227 --> 12:57.443
that's the red alert.

12:57.478 --> 13:00.563
That means their missiles
are on their way.

13:00.598 --> 13:02.448
Ours will follow
soon after.

13:04.316 --> 13:07.453
And you are to
survive, mr. Radin?

13:07.488 --> 13:09.321
Is that the idea?

13:09.356 --> 13:11.457
I am to survive, mr. Hughes.

13:11.492 --> 13:13.325
I am 300 feet underground.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.828
And what about you, reverend?

13:15.863 --> 13:18.330
Do you wish
to survive?

13:18.365 --> 13:21.467
Do the rest of you
wish to survive?

13:22.084 --> 13:26.472
Or am i to be
the only pallbearer?

13:37.768 --> 13:41.237
This is your civil
defense announcer.

13:41.272 --> 13:45.741
Repeating, the air defense
command has just declared

13:45.776 --> 13:47.610
a take-cover signal.

13:47.645 --> 13:50.496
This is not a practice warning,
not a drill.

13:50.531 --> 13:54.366
An attack by enemy forces
is expected at any moment.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.870
You must seek the nearest
shelter immediately.

13:57.905 --> 13:59.121
If you are in your home,

13:59.156 --> 14:02.258
go to your prepared shelter
or to the basement.

14:02.293 --> 14:04.760
If you have no shelter
or basement,

14:04.795 --> 14:07.263
go toward the center of the
house, to the first room

14:07.298 --> 14:08.764
or hall
that will put as many walls

14:08.799 --> 14:13.135
as possible between you
and the outside of the house.

14:13.170 --> 14:15.020
Take your radio with you.

14:15.055 --> 14:18.140
If you are in any other type of
building, go to the basement

14:18.175 --> 14:21.277
or lowest floor and get as close
to the center of the building

14:21.312 --> 14:22.528
as possible.

14:31.053 --> 14:34.740
...leave your shelter until told
it is safe to do so.

14:34.775 --> 14:36.625
This is not a test.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.994
This is a real take-cover...

14:42.748 --> 14:43.999
comments?

14:44.034 --> 14:47.753
Perhaps a little military
sophistry now, colonel.

14:47.788 --> 14:49.638
A quote from
general grant.

14:49.673 --> 14:50.890
Or you, reverend,

14:50.925 --> 14:53.392
something enriching
from the gospel.

14:53.427 --> 14:55.261
Such silence, mrs. Langsford?

14:55.296 --> 14:57.763
Nothing in that vast repertoire,

14:57.798 --> 15:00.266
that pilgrim's progress mind
of yours,

15:00.301 --> 15:01.517
to handle
the situation?

15:01.552 --> 15:04.019
A mental eraser to
wipe out reality?

15:04.054 --> 15:06.021
I've got to
get to my wife.

15:06.056 --> 15:09.158
By all means, reverend,
get to your wife.

15:09.193 --> 15:12.278
Hold hands and
die together.

15:12.313 --> 15:14.780
You turn my stomach,
mr. Hughes.

15:14.815 --> 15:16.665
"Get to your wife."

15:16.700 --> 15:18.534
That's not what's
on your mind.

15:18.569 --> 15:21.670
What's on your mind is
what's on the colonel's mind

15:21.705 --> 15:23.539
and the schoolmarm's mind.

15:23.574 --> 15:26.041
Your precious hide,
your sanctified flesh.

15:26.076 --> 15:28.544
That's what preoccupies
you at the moment.

15:28.579 --> 15:29.795
If i'm to die tonight

15:29.830 --> 15:32.298
i want to be with
someone i love.

15:32.333 --> 15:35.434
"Somebody i love..."
how theatrical!

15:35.469 --> 15:36.685
But more burlesque
than legitimate.

15:37.303 --> 15:39.188
Have the decency, reverend,
to depart this earth

15:39.805 --> 15:41.690
with just a fragment of
the truth in your mouth.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.193
Tell me to my face
that you're so scared,

15:44.228 --> 15:45.444
so miserably frightened,

15:45.479 --> 15:47.313
that you'd sell
your wife by the pound

15:47.348 --> 15:49.198
if it meant
your own survival.

15:49.233 --> 15:52.952
If those were the last words
i spoke before i died,

15:52.987 --> 15:55.454
they would also be
the worst falsehood

15:55.489 --> 15:57.323
i ever uttered on earth.

15:57.358 --> 15:59.825
Now, will you open this door?

15:59.860 --> 16:01.710
Will you let me leave now?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.233
How did you
know, radin?

16:24.268 --> 16:25.484
How could you
possibly have known?

16:25.519 --> 16:26.735
What difference
does it make?

16:26.770 --> 16:27.987
If he'll let
us leave now

16:28.022 --> 16:30.239
perhaps we can
reach our homes
before it happens.

16:30.274 --> 16:32.741
My dear friends, shall we drop
the pretenses now?

16:32.776 --> 16:34.610
Shall we, all of us now,
tell the truth?

16:34.645 --> 16:37.496
I told you
how this room
was constructed-

16:37.531 --> 16:39.248
steel, concrete and lead.

16:39.283 --> 16:42.368
It may be the only place on
earth where you can survive.

16:42.403 --> 16:45.504
Now, what is this nonsense
about going back to your homes?

16:45.539 --> 16:48.624
Do you mean to say that you
would walk out of here and die

16:48.659 --> 16:51.126
when by simply sitting
here you could live?

16:53.379 --> 16:55.881
Are we to understand,
mr. Radin,

16:55.916 --> 16:58.384
that you will permit
us this luxury?

16:58.419 --> 17:00.636
You will allow
us to stay?

17:00.671 --> 17:02.521
Of course, colonel.
As a matter of fact,

17:02.556 --> 17:04.390
it's precisely why
i've asked you to come.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.526
Each of you in his own way
has tried to destroy me.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.395
But i'll not repay
the compliment.

17:09.430 --> 17:11.896
That is to say, i will not
require an eye for an eye,

17:11.932 --> 17:13.781
nothing as primitive
or as naked as that.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.535
What is your price,
mr. Radin?

17:16.569 --> 17:18.404
I'd be interested.

17:18.439 --> 17:20.906
The colonel would
be interested.

17:20.941 --> 17:24.042
I presume the reverend
and the schoolmarm

17:24.078 --> 17:25.294
would be interested.

17:25.329 --> 17:26.545
I submit,
dear friends,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.414
you're not
just interested.

17:28.449 --> 17:31.550
It's probably the only
thing in god's earth

17:31.585 --> 17:34.053
that has any meaning
left at all.

17:34.088 --> 17:37.056
But the price, colonel...

17:37.091 --> 17:38.307
you will beg my pardon,

17:38.342 --> 17:40.175
you will ask my forgiveness,

17:40.210 --> 17:43.929
and, if need be, will get
down on your hands and knees

17:43.964 --> 17:45.814
to perform the function.

17:45.849 --> 17:47.182
"Pretty please
with sugar on it."

17:47.217 --> 17:49.685
How's that?
Speak up, teacher.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.571
"Pretty please
with sugar on it."

17:52.606 --> 17:56.325
It's what children say
to exact a favor.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.827
I don't want your
favor, mr. Radin!

17:58.862 --> 18:00.696
Let me out of here!

18:00.731 --> 18:03.832
If i'm to spend my last
quarter hour on earth

18:03.867 --> 18:06.335
i'd rather spend it
with a stray cat

18:06.370 --> 18:08.203
or alone in central park

18:08.238 --> 18:10.706
or in a city
full of strangers

18:10.741 --> 18:13.459
whose names
i'll never know.

18:13.494 --> 18:15.961
The door, radin.

18:15.996 --> 18:19.098
Will you open
the door now?

18:19.133 --> 18:22.217
Open up, radin.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.354
You're too blind
or you're too stupid,

18:25.389 --> 18:27.856
because none of you
seem to understand.

18:27.891 --> 18:29.108
All you have to do-

18:29.143 --> 18:32.227
literally, all you have
to do- is to say a sentence.

18:32.262 --> 18:34.980
Just a string of
silly, stupid words.

18:35.015 --> 18:36.865
Like a command, colonel,

18:37.483 --> 18:39.368
or like
a lesson, teacher,

18:39.403 --> 18:41.870
or like
a prayer, reverend.

18:43.739 --> 18:46.875
All you have to say
is you're sorry.

18:55.384 --> 18:59.755
All right,
you want to die, fine.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.006
But you'll be back

19:01.041 --> 19:02.007
inside
five minutes.

19:07.012 --> 19:08.263
There's the elevator!
Take it!

19:08.298 --> 19:10.149
Take the farce
to its conclusion.

19:10.184 --> 19:12.017
Go up into the street
and see the panic

19:12.052 --> 19:13.268
and the frenzy
and the horror.

19:13.303 --> 19:15.154
And then come back down
here to your salvation.

19:15.189 --> 19:17.656
Or you can watch it all
down here on that screen.

19:17.691 --> 19:19.525
You can see it all happen,
the whole thing.

19:19.560 --> 19:23.278
Watch the world being
shoveled into a grave.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.288
It's your
last chance.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.042
It's your last chance,
i mean it.

19:37.077 --> 19:40.179
Tell me, reverend, is
life so stinking cheap

19:40.214 --> 19:42.681
that you can throw
it down a drain?

19:42.716 --> 19:46.435
Life is very dear, mr. Radin,
infinitely valuable.

19:46.470 --> 19:50.189
But there are other things
that come even higher.

19:50.224 --> 19:52.057
Honor is one of them-

19:52.092 --> 19:55.194
perhaps the most
expensive of them all.

19:55.811 --> 19:57.062
Amen.

19:57.097 --> 19:59.565
Try not to get
too lonely, mr. Radin.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.816
Use mirrors.
They may help.

20:00.851 --> 20:02.067
Put them all
around the room.

20:02.102 --> 20:05.204
Then you'll have the company
of a world full of radins.

20:05.239 --> 20:06.455
It'll be a fantasy,
of course,

20:06.490 --> 20:08.957
but then your whole life
has been a fantasy,

20:08.992 --> 20:10.209
a parade of illusions-

20:10.244 --> 20:13.328
illusions about what
people have done to you,

20:13.363 --> 20:15.831
illusions about what justice is,

20:15.866 --> 20:18.333
illusions about
what is the dignity

20:18.368 --> 20:20.219
of even the
lowest of us.

20:20.254 --> 20:21.470
A fantasy,
mr. Radin,

20:21.505 --> 20:24.590
and now you can have
it all to yourself.

20:29.595 --> 20:33.982
No, it's not true,
it's not a fantasy.

20:34.017 --> 20:36.485
No, it's not a fantasy!

20:39.640 --> 20:42.107
This is your civil defense
announcer.

20:42.142 --> 20:46.495
Our military authorities have
just ordered a take-cover alert.

20:46.530 --> 20:48.997
Attack by enemy forces
is imminent.

20:49.032 --> 20:50.866
Take cover immediately.

20:50.901 --> 20:54.753
If you are in your car driving
away from your city, continue.

20:54.788 --> 20:56.622
Keep on driving.

20:56.657 --> 20:58.507
Do not stop.

20:58.542 --> 21:00.509
When movement is
no longer possible,

21:00.544 --> 21:02.010
seek the best available refuge.

21:02.045 --> 21:03.879
That's enough!

21:04.513 --> 21:08.267
If you are outdoors on foot,
hurry to the nearest shelter...

21:17.392 --> 21:19.895
that's quite enough!

22:44.765 --> 22:47.232
Anybody?

22:47.866 --> 22:49.117
Anybody.

22:49.152 --> 22:51.620
Please...

22:51.655 --> 22:54.122
somebody...

22:54.157 --> 22:55.490
hey, mac, mac.

22:55.525 --> 22:58.627
Had a little
bit too much?

22:58.662 --> 23:00.495
Hey, mac.

23:00.530 --> 23:01.747
I didn't want
it this way.

23:01.782 --> 23:03.632
Let me take
you home, mac.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.500
I didn't want
it this way.

23:05.535 --> 23:07.386
No, somebody, please.
Mac...?

23:07.421 --> 23:11.757
Anybody, won't
somebody listen to me?

23:16.179 --> 23:18.013
Go on now, move along.
Move along, please.

23:18.048 --> 23:19.898
There isn't a thing
here to worry about.

23:20.515 --> 23:21.266
Move along, please!

23:21.301 --> 23:23.151
Please, move along,
please, please.

23:23.186 --> 23:25.020
It's okay now.
You're gonna
be all right.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.522
We're going
to help you.

23:27.557 --> 23:29.408
Isn't there
anybody left?

23:30.025 --> 23:30.659
Nobody?

23:30.694 --> 23:31.910
You're gonna be
all right.

23:31.945 --> 23:33.161
Nobody!

23:33.196 --> 23:34.413
Now, go on,
break it up.

23:34.448 --> 23:36.281
There isn't a
thing here to see.
Go on, go on.

23:36.316 --> 23:38.166
Nobody.

23:38.784 --> 23:41.286
Nobody...

23:41.321 --> 23:43.171
oh, god...

23:44.423 --> 23:46.291
god...

23:50.045 --> 23:52.547
mr. Paul radin,
a dealer in fantasy

23:52.582 --> 23:55.050
who sits in the rubble
of his own making

23:55.085 --> 23:58.186
and imagines that he's
the last man on earth,

23:58.221 --> 24:01.306
doomed to a perdition
of unutterable loneliness

24:01.341 --> 24:05.060
because a practical joke
has turned into a nightmare.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.562
Mr. Paul radin,
pallbearer at a funeral

24:07.597 --> 24:11.316
that he manufactured himself
in the twilight zone.

24:14.336 --> 24:17.405
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

24:17.440 --> 24:19.908
will tell you
about next week's story

24:19.943 --> 24:22.027
after this message.

24:23.028 --> 24:24.546
And now, mr. Serling.

24:24.581 --> 24:27.666
Next week, through the good
offices of mr. Charles beaumont,

24:27.701 --> 24:29.551
we take a walk
in some dead man's shoes.

24:29.586 --> 24:32.053
It's the story of a hobo
who takes some shoes

24:32.088 --> 24:34.556
off a recently-deceased hoodlum,
and then discovers

24:34.591 --> 24:37.058
that if the shoe fits,
